WEBVTT

02:17.160 --> 02:18.360
Get down!

02:18.360 --> 02:20.360
Let's flush them out house by house.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.640
You gone done givin' them
their excuse, do you know that?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.960
They killed Phillip.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.040
- And I was just supposed to let...
- Who? Who killed Phillip?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.680
That family you killed?

05:59.680 --> 06:02.680
- Those exact people?
- They're all rotten.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.120
- The whole damn town.
- You made us look like animals,

06:05.120 --> 06:07.360
Kevin. Do you understand that?

06:07.360 --> 06:11.120
They now have everything they
need to come in here with a big

06:11.120 --> 06:13.840
damn army and wipe us all out.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.360
You destroyed everything.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.720
He done burn the whole place down.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.440
So what would you have done?
Gone in and asked nicely?

06:26.160 --> 06:29.160
Kindly begged them to hand
over Elizabeth after she killed

06:29.160 --> 06:31.760
- your son in cold blood?
- All right, that's enough.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.360
Come on now, Pops.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.760
I went in and did exactly
what you would've done.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.160
I've always done what
you wanted, Father.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.800
Always.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.320
You didn't even have
to come out to say it.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.200
- I didn't want this.
- That's a damn lie.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.480
You run around talking about...

06:58.480 --> 07:00.680
About good and light.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.760
To hide this darkness inside you.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.400
I can see it.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.640
I see it.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.320
I can see you.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.440
You were right about
this all coming to an end.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.440
There's nothing we can do to stop it.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.600
We can still save this town.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.080
Our people.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.640
Let me talk to her.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.440
Try to...

08:28.440 --> 08:31.280
negotiate our retreat.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.960
Nobody wants a bloodbath.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.160
No, I ain't running.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.840
Father.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.160
Elizabeth knows everything.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.040
Aaron, that boy who works at the well,

08:52.040 --> 08:54.600
who we welcomed among us, is a traitor.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.520
He told her what was going on here.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.280
That's how she knew
where to find our weapons.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.600
In New Babylon, the traitor
right here this whole time.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.760
Why you didn't say something?

09:21.560 --> 09:23.560
By the time I found out,

09:26.040 --> 09:27.960
you'd already made up your mind.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.120
I'm so sorry.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.400
What did I do?

10:31.360 --> 10:33.760
You know exactly what you did.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.960
No, I swear on the Bible
I didn't do anything.

10:37.760 --> 10:42.120
Phillip is dead. And
I almost lost Seymour.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.120
You know how many other people in
this city are dead because of you?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.360
John.

10:46.360 --> 10:50.240
And now you're a dead
man because of Elizabeth.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.840
I hate the Lady, I hate her.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.040
I wish that I had been loyal
to you and this city, but...

10:59.360 --> 11:02.680
- ...I had no choice.
- John, please. Put the gun down.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.520
You turned us against each other.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.080
John, don't do it. Please.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.120
I doubted my own son.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.240
I wanna offer you mercy.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.360
But this is as much as you're gonna get.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.320
Where is Julian Wright?

12:25.320 --> 12:28.160
He's not here. There's no men here.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.120
It's just us and the children.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.560
- Now, I know he's here.
- He's not here, I swear!

12:32.560 --> 12:35.360
Tell me where he is, or I'll
burn your entire house down

12:35.360 --> 12:38.200
- with you and everything in it.
- I'm telling you, he's not here.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.720
He never came back from the
war. I haven't seen him in years.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.880
It's your last chance.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.200
I beg you. We don't...

12:44.200 --> 12:46.920
Tell that coward of a husband
of yours to get out here, now!

12:46.920 --> 12:48.520
Please. I beg you.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.480
Okay, burn it down.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.880
No, no! No please!

12:53.880 --> 12:55.520
Help! No!

12:55.520 --> 12:58.560
- No! Stop!
- Please, stop!

12:58.560 --> 13:01.360
- No! No, for God's sake!
- No, please!

13:01.360 --> 13:03.920
- Please, for God's sake!
- Don't! Please!

13:03.920 --> 13:07.480
- Wait! Wait!
- Hold on.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.000
- I'm here.
- What?

13:11.640 --> 13:12.960
I'm here.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.080
You Julian Wright?

13:28.280 --> 13:30.360
Yes, sir.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.960
Come on, let's get out of here.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.120
Maggie! Stop! Stop, Maggie!

14:18.120 --> 14:19.280
No!

14:19.280 --> 14:21.560
This is not what we came here for!

14:21.560 --> 14:23.640
This is not why we're here! Stop!

14:24.760 --> 14:25.880
No!

14:37.920 --> 14:40.920
Sarah!

15:05.480 --> 15:07.120
I don't wanna hurt ya.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.720
I swear.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.480
For the first time in my life,

15:40.480 --> 15:43.080
I'm grateful you can't see.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.080
That you're spared the
horror we have in front of us.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.840
Do you remember Mary
Jane Blackwater, my son?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.680
She's dead.

15:56.680 --> 16:01.280
Her body lies in a
coffin, next to her sister.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.120
They were both slaughtered like lambs.

16:14.720 --> 16:19.200
Do you wanna be a lamb,
waiting to be eaten by the wolf?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.760
No!

16:20.760 --> 16:26.040
Do you wanna be a lion, ready
to defend yourself and God's law?

16:26.040 --> 16:28.000
- Yes!
- Yes!

16:28.000 --> 16:29.920
- A lion!
- A lion!

16:29.920 --> 16:35.520
A lion! A lion!

16:35.520 --> 16:37.000
A lion!

16:38.000 --> 16:39.800
Let's pray.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.760
I've been looking for you everywhere.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.520
Listen Sarah, I know you probably
don't approve of what I did.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.920
But you... you have to understand-

17:16.920 --> 17:18.680
I remember that night.

17:25.360 --> 17:27.440
It was you.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.000
But I don't understand...

17:43.480 --> 17:46.280
Andrew had some concerns
about going to war.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.920
I insisted he come with me.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.440
And then he ended up getting
killed in an ambush by a greycoat.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.200
I came across a name.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.880
Julian Wright is the man who killed him.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.480
So, I went looking for him.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.200
And I killed him.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.080
Why?

18:14.760 --> 18:19.120
I thought avenging his death
would... would help me somehow, but...

18:20.720 --> 18:22.960
I didn't mean for 'em all to die.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.760
Why did you lie to me?

18:27.320 --> 18:29.160
I wanted to protect you.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.880
You were a child, and
I thought if I could...

18:34.880 --> 18:37.400
A chance to go through life without

18:37.400 --> 18:40.680
all the pain and all the suffering.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.600
And, at least I owed you that.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.560
And I committed to this lie.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.480
This lie, I ended up believing myself.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.240
You know, I often thought about the...

18:53.240 --> 18:54.720
The one good thing...

18:56.120 --> 18:58.840
...to come out of that night
and that was meetin' you.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.240
I love you, Sarah.

19:29.720 --> 19:34.680
I would've been dead today,
if you hadn't found me.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.800
You're my greatest love,

19:37.800 --> 19:40.960
and you never let me down.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.160
I know this is the final test.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.480
I'm your soldier

19:51.840 --> 19:53.800
and I will follow through.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.520
It's the most...

20:01.520 --> 20:03.560
difficult sacrifice,

20:07.040 --> 20:09.120
but I trust you

20:11.360 --> 20:13.240
and I will let you guide me.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.240
Sarah, what is it?

20:42.240 --> 20:44.880
What is it?

20:44.880 --> 20:46.040
Look at me.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.760
What is it? Tell me.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.720
Look at me.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.880
I thought I remembered.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.920
I'm sorry.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.720
Sorry? For what?

21:02.040 --> 21:03.480
What is it?

21:06.040 --> 21:08.120
It wasn't the Indians.

21:15.240 --> 21:20.400
It was so dark and it was so fast and...

21:20.400 --> 21:24.880
...every time I thought about
it, it hurt so much and I...

21:24.880 --> 21:27.040
I couldn't face it. I...

21:28.360 --> 21:32.040
What do you mean? What
are you talking about?

21:37.360 --> 21:39.280
Tell me.

21:39.280 --> 21:43.400
It w... It was the bluecoats.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.840
It was John!

21:48.560 --> 21:52.600
It was him! He killed everyone.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.960
Now I remember.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.800
I remember everything.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.680
He...

22:03.880 --> 22:06.560
He...

22:06.560 --> 22:09.280
He wanted to avenge his
son, and he came to our house

22:09.280 --> 22:11.200
and he was looking for you.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.120
That's why he was there.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.800
I'm sorry.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.360
I'm sorry.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.680
It's all right. It's all right.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.400
It's all right. It's all right.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.320
John Ellis!

23:09.320 --> 23:12.160
Not a good time, stranger.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.240
You remember a man named Julian Wright?

23:18.240 --> 23:20.240
Yeah.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.280
Did you kill him?

23:24.640 --> 23:27.320
Yeah, I did.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.400
Why? What...

23:28.400 --> 23:29.960
What's it to you?

23:31.720 --> 23:33.800
You didn't kill him.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.120
You killed his best friend.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.640
And his wife.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.080
And his...

23:45.080 --> 23:46.840
...two lovely sons.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.280
But you didn't kill him.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.680
I know that.

23:54.280 --> 23:58.880
'Cause Julian Wright is standing
right here in front of you.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.280
You're Julian Wright?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.720
- All this time.
- All this time.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.600
I came looking for you, only you.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.880
Nobody else was supposed to get hurt.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.040
Why did you come after me at all?

24:24.240 --> 24:26.000
'Cause you killed Andrew.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.840
It's the war. I was a
hostage, he was a soldier.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.520
- And he was also my son...
- It's a fucking war!

24:34.920 --> 24:37.440
My family did nothing to you.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.960
There's a difference.
Nothing. Innocent people.

24:52.040 --> 24:55.120
I am truly sorry...

24:55.120 --> 24:58.520
...for what happened to your family.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.560
I am.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.280
Are you?

25:03.280 --> 25:05.480
Listen, if I could go back

25:06.960 --> 25:10.680
and have some things
be different, I would.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.360
But I would still...

25:17.360 --> 25:19.920
...come after the man

25:19.920 --> 25:22.200
who killed my son.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.040
War or no war.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.000
Here's your chance.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.120
Ain't it funny?

26:02.200 --> 26:05.960
I almost killed you in that same
spot when you first got here.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.040
Well, you should've.

26:08.040 --> 26:11.480
No. I'm mighty glad you stuck around.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.280
And I know you are too.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.920
Well, it doesn't change a thing.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.320
You're right.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.160
It doesn't.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.920
Stop it. Both of you, now!

27:20.920 --> 27:24.400
Sarah, get out of the way. Do it.

27:24.400 --> 27:28.440
Yeah, Sarah. You best
listen to your father.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.320
- What'd I tell you?
- No.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.760
You listen to me!

27:34.760 --> 27:40.120
There are people coming for us
right now. These people need you.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.880
Alive. Both of you.

27:42.880 --> 27:46.840
If you're killing each other,
you're condemning everyone to death.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.880
And you're killing me.

27:49.880 --> 27:53.480
I'm not going to survive
watching you both kill each other.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.320
If you pull your trigger, I pull mine.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.360
Sarah.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.720
What's the plan... Julian?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.920
We wait for this part to be over.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.440
After that,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.320
I might... I might have
to kill your father.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.320
I see.

30:08.560 --> 30:12.600
Hell, you're not the
man I thought you were.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.280
And my father ain't either.

30:17.160 --> 30:21.600
You and Sarah have been through
pain I can't even imagine.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.080
So I don't blame you...

30:28.080 --> 30:30.120
...for what you decide.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.920
But what is this place,

30:34.400 --> 30:36.920
if not a chance to...

30:36.920 --> 30:38.760
...look towards the future?

30:39.960 --> 30:41.640
Hell, that's why you came, ain't it?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.880
No, you got that wrong.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.960
I came here to find
whoever killed my family.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.800
That's why I came here.

31:20.560 --> 31:23.800
We can place rifles along here, but
the risk is if we drive them down...

31:23.800 --> 31:27.440
They left Elmdale a few hours
ago. They'll be here before sunset.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.640
How many men?

31:28.640 --> 31:31.400
Forty horses at least and
more men on the ground.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.080
Also, they have a cannon.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.280
Well, if we stick to the
plan, it should hold 'em off.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.920
No, we can't. One cannon is
enough to get through the gate.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.640
We can't keep 'em out.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.200
What else is there to do?

31:49.640 --> 31:51.000
We should leave.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.720
I want no prisoners.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.840
We're gonna burn this
city to the ground.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.600
Tomorrow, only ashes will remain.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.840
Yes, ma'am.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.360
Fire!

35:08.480 --> 35:10.000
They fled.

35:16.600 --> 35:20.080
Burn it down.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.600
Leave no trace.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.280
Light it up!

35:40.600 --> 35:42.200
Jesus Christ!

35:47.160 --> 35:48.800
Get down!

35:50.720 --> 35:52.960
Up there!

35:52.960 --> 35:56.640
Hey! Come on! Come on!

36:02.240 --> 36:04.360
Yeah!

38:37.360 --> 38:39.120
Fuck you!

39:11.360 --> 39:16.400
Ma'am. Either we surrender or we die.

39:17.400 --> 39:21.360
I say, either we die praying...

39:21.360 --> 39:23.360
...or we die killin'.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.280
And I've done my prayers already.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.000
Uh!

40:46.840 --> 40:48.200
Stop right there.

40:49.600 --> 40:54.280
Now raise your hands, nice and slow.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.120
That's right.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.000
Nice and slow.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.440
Give me the gun.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.560
Now, turn around.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.920
Call John, for me.

41:32.080 --> 41:35.400
- Call him, or I'll shoot.
- I'm here, Elizabeth.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.640
We've already lost
enough people between us.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.960
Let's put an end to this.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.360
Come on now.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.160
Let's put our guns down.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.760
Uh! Oh! Uhh!

43:01.760 --> 43:02.920
John.

43:13.280 --> 43:17.080
Come on. Come on, sit
up, come on, come on.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.520
Look at me.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.720
That's not good. That's not good.

43:34.840 --> 43:38.760
I'm glad I met you when I did, friend.

43:48.840 --> 43:52.320
Oh, John.

43:57.480 --> 43:58.720
C'mere.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.400
Sarah. Sarah...

44:57.240 --> 44:58.680
Ah!

46:10.200 --> 46:15.360
John Ellis gave everything
to defend this place.

46:16.480 --> 46:18.280
We carved it out of nothin'.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.480
We dug so deep that we made it bleed.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.200
And then we all bled with it.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.680
It was his dream to start a new city.

46:30.600 --> 46:34.920
A new society where
everyone could be free...

46:35.840 --> 46:37.400
...and equal.

46:38.280 --> 46:42.320
Sometimes he got so caught up
in that dream that he lost sight

46:42.320 --> 46:44.360
of what we really had.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.760
He wasn't the perfect man.

46:46.760 --> 46:50.960
I saw what he was capable of
when anger blinded his heart.

46:50.960 --> 46:54.040
I don't want to justify his
mistakes, and I can never

46:54.040 --> 46:55.920
fully forgive him.

46:55.920 --> 46:58.400
But I know the ruthless
world he grew up in

46:58.400 --> 47:01.320
and the deep sufferin' that nurtured it.

47:01.320 --> 47:04.440
It's the same sufferin'
you all went through.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.560
But we are not perfect either.

47:08.520 --> 47:13.080
But we try our best to build
the world that we wanna see.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.600
Now we have a choice.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.280
We can either give up on that dream,

47:23.040 --> 47:25.560
we scatter like dust in the wind,

47:26.800 --> 47:30.560
or we rebuild it.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.720
I know which one I want.

47:36.880 --> 47:38.080
Me too.

47:42.440 --> 47:43.720
Me too.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.640
I'm in.

47:56.760 --> 47:58.040
Me too.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.400
Let's do it.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.160
- Me too.
- Yes.

48:02.160 --> 48:03.480
Let's do it.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.600
- All right.
- We're with you.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.800
- I'm in.
- The Lord is with us.

48:09.560 --> 48:11.840
I'm in. Yes.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.960
I've always wanted to see the Pacific.

49:45.960 --> 49:49.760
There's a... a little town down south...

49:52.960 --> 49:55.320
This town isn't enough for you?

49:55.320 --> 49:58.320
It's a... It's a little too much.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.840
Would you mind saying
goodbye to the others?

50:01.840 --> 50:04.840
I'm not... I'm not
really good at goodbyes.

50:04.840 --> 50:06.280
Stay then.

50:17.560 --> 50:19.520
You can stop running away, you know?

50:19.520 --> 50:21.640
I'm not running away, Sarah.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.920
You have a dream.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.200
Which means you have a future.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.440
I stopped dreaming a long time ago.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.480
The only dream I had
left was to find you

50:42.480 --> 50:44.320
and make sure you were safe.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.680
Truth is,

50:55.520 --> 50:57.560
I can't get rid of my nightmares.

51:08.880 --> 51:11.920
Remember that moment at
sunset where everything

51:11.920 --> 51:13.680
turns into the same colour?

51:19.280 --> 51:20.840
Absolute red.

51:23.640 --> 51:24.960
Yep.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.000
I'll see you there.

53:01.880 --> 53:04.320
I met... I met you like...

53:05.040 --> 53:07.600
Like a blinding light in the darkness.

53:09.720 --> 53:14.920
I sacrificed everything.
I accepted everything.

53:15.720 --> 53:19.080
When you gave my heart to
a man I could never have.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.240
When you gave me a cruel father,

53:22.240 --> 53:24.840
an abusive husband, a crippled son

53:24.840 --> 53:28.360
and I stayed faithful to you.

53:28.360 --> 53:30.600
Where are you now?

53:32.240 --> 53:35.360
Why have you turned your back on me?

53:38.320 --> 53:42.920
Why... do I no longer hear your voice?

53:46.200 --> 53:48.960
Did you take my ear...

53:51.920 --> 53:55.400
...so I... so I wouldn't
hear you anymore?

53:57.520 --> 54:00.960
Is this some kind of sick game?

54:05.440 --> 54:07.680
Is that what you are?

54:10.960 --> 54:16.640
Then I, I... disavow you.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.840
And I promise you,

54:27.840 --> 54:30.320
wherever you may be hiding,

54:31.960 --> 54:37.760
you will see a burning star
come even closer and closer.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.360
And that is me.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.720
And I'm coming for you.

55:19.640 --> 55:21.080
Mama.
