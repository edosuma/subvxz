00:20.303 --> 00:22.134
Sorry, I'm late.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.103
Diet cola, please. Thank you.

00:28.712 --> 00:32.170
So how'd things go with Irene?

00:37.987 --> 00:39.011
Sorry, David.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.954
She won't even let me apologize?

00:43.126 --> 00:45.959
David, there are some things
an apology just can't change.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.926
Well, is she dating someone else?

00:50.066 --> 00:52.762
She's moved on. And so should you.

00:56.639 --> 01:00.666
This thing with Irene,
it hurt your career.

01:00.844 --> 01:03.108
You know, it kills me because
she gets promoted...

01:03.279 --> 01:04.712
...and I'm the bad guy.
- Yeah.

01:04.881 --> 01:06.872
Sanchez won't talk to me
unless he has to.

01:07.050 --> 01:08.608
Tao, he's polite but distant.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.719
And the chief...

01:10.887 --> 01:13.378
Chief won't confide in me anymore.

01:13.556 --> 01:17.048
So I don't know,
maybe I should take the lieutenant's test.

01:17.227 --> 01:21.061
No. Outside of Major Crimes,
lieutenant's an administrative position...

01:21.231 --> 01:23.392
...just like sergeant.

01:23.566 --> 01:27.730
Instead of taking a step up,
consider this, take a step sideways.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.739
Add "detective" to your present rank.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.405
And that's something
I can help you with.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.495
L.A.P.D. Everyone, stay inside.

02:01.471 --> 02:05.532
Hey, stop! Police! Stop now! Police!

02:08.411 --> 02:12.177
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

02:12.882 --> 02:14.440
Where's your gun?

02:15.151 --> 02:18.552
- What did you do with your weapon?
- Please. Please, I don't wanna die.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.655
- You all right?
- Fine. We got a victim...

02:20.824 --> 02:23.019
...by the newsstand,
This kid took a shot at me.

02:23.193 --> 02:25.957
We need to secure the area
and find his gun!

02:31.034 --> 02:32.899
Hurry up, guys.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.005
- You're going to the ER with this kid.
- I can't. I shot him.

02:41.177 --> 02:43.975
- I have to wait. We have to find his gun.
- This kid is dying.

02:44.147 --> 02:46.547
If you want time to question him,
it's gotta be now.

02:47.717 --> 02:50.447
Go. Go.

03:09.806 --> 03:11.831
I want every inch of this area taped off.

03:12.008 --> 03:14.476
Sergeant Davies, make sure
those casings over there...

03:14.644 --> 03:16.544
...are marked with our GPS system.

03:16.713 --> 03:19.443
That couple over there,
the ones who called 911...

03:19.616 --> 03:21.675
...they say they saw the murder
from the car.

03:21.851 --> 03:24.183
Separate them, get detailed,
and I mean detailed...

03:24.354 --> 03:27.152
...statements from both of them.
- Uh, Captain Raydor?

03:27.323 --> 03:29.689
Lieutenant Flynn,
I'm a little busy. What is it?

03:29.859 --> 03:32.487
Well, we were wondering if,
while you're investigating...

03:32.662 --> 03:34.687
...the shooting of a scumbag suspect...

03:34.864 --> 03:36.729
...we might look into the actual murder.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.425
Chief Johnson won't be happy
with the evidence detior...

03:39.602 --> 03:43.402
This isn't Chief Johnson's crime scene,
So I wouldn't worry about it, gentlemen.

03:43.573 --> 03:47.134
Officer-involved shootings
are my jurisdiction, not Major Crimes'.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.938
- That dead body over there is ours.
- Not tonight.

03:50.847 --> 03:54.408
Uh, Captain Raydor, uh,
maybe it might expedite things if...

03:54.584 --> 03:57.212
If you explain why the sergeant
who pulled the trigger...

03:57.387 --> 03:59.548
...was permitted to leave after
drinking...

03:59.722 --> 04:03.488
...and while you were with him,
which makes you a percipient witness.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.891
- What hospital am I going to?
- Cedars.

04:08.898 --> 04:12.231
Sergeant Ray, get the commander's
statement and get him out of here.

04:12.402 --> 04:15.462
Sergeant Elliot,
I'm reachable on my cell!

04:25.715 --> 04:28.240
- Chief.
- Sergeant.

04:28.418 --> 04:30.648
- You're okay?
- Uh, yeah, I'm...

04:30.820 --> 04:34.381
Yes, ma'am.
I'm just waiting to hear about, um...

04:34.557 --> 04:36.024
...Erik Whitner, the kid I shot.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.287
- Doesn't look good.
- Taylor told me you had a chance...

04:40.463 --> 04:43.455
...to question this young man, Erik,
on your way to the hospital.

04:43.633 --> 04:47.569
Getting in the, uh... In the ambulance,
he just kept saying he didn't wanna die...

04:47.737 --> 04:49.466
...and that no one was supposed
to get hurt...

04:49.639 --> 04:52.199
Ugh, that's odd to say,
since he was killing people.

04:54.410 --> 04:55.468
What else did he say?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.539
Look, chief, um...

05:00.717 --> 05:02.309
...I may have made a mistake here.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.780
Okay, what was that?

05:05.955 --> 05:09.015
I never read the kid his rights,
and I talked to him...

05:09.192 --> 05:14.289
...while he was laid out on the stretcher...
- No, that's okay. Ugh, that's not a mistake.

05:14.464 --> 05:15.897
That's not a mistake, um...

05:17.800 --> 05:20.860
Erik is probably dying,
and dying declarations are admissible...

05:21.037 --> 05:22.061
...in murder trials.

05:26.376 --> 05:30.335
Wait. Chief, why are you here
instead of the crime scene?

05:30.513 --> 05:34.244
Well, unfortunately, David, Major Crimes
isn't allowed to pursue this homicide...

05:34.417 --> 05:38.717
...until after the force investigation division
has finished their initial assessment...

05:38.888 --> 05:40.515
...of what you did.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.258
- What?
- Look, look, I need you to sit down.

05:44.027 --> 05:46.587
Okay? I need you to sit down
right now and listen to me.

05:50.199 --> 05:54.329
Commander Taylor sent FID to the wrong
hospital, but they're gonna figure that out.

05:54.504 --> 05:57.667
We have maybe minutes before your lawyer
shows up and Captain Raydor steps in.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.967
- Whoa. My lawyer?
- I need you to tell me...

06:00.143 --> 06:03.271
...exactly what happened?
Exactly what happened?

06:05.148 --> 06:10.677
I... I heard shots. I ran out of the bar.
I saw the victim down by the newsstand.

06:10.853 --> 06:14.846
I looked up, I saw the gunman fleeing.
I identified myself as a police officer...

06:15.024 --> 06:17.720
...ordered him to stop.
He turned, opened fire. Two shots.

06:17.894 --> 06:20.886
And I returned fire, and I dropped him.

06:22.231 --> 06:25.132
- Erik Whitner fired his gun twice?
- Yes, twice.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.360
- At you? Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

06:27.537 --> 06:30.734
FID is gonna tell you that there was
no gun found at the crime scene.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.898
The only casings
were from a 9-millimeter...

06:33.076 --> 06:35.636
...and I'm certain
that is gonna match up with your gun.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.509
- There was a gun because he shot at me.
- But there were no bullet impacts...

06:39.682 --> 06:42.242
...behind where you were standing
and no ricochet marks.

06:42.418 --> 06:44.886
As far as FID is concerned,
you were not fired upon...

06:45.054 --> 06:48.649
...and you shot an unarmed man.
- What about the body at the newsstand.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.953
- Doesn't that prove there was a gun?
- Are you absolutely positive...

06:52.128 --> 06:55.620
...that Erik Whitner fired at you?
- Sergeant Gabriel, don't answer that.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.531
- Who are you?
- Anthony Monroe.

06:58.701 --> 07:02.660
Communications division notified the union
and I've been assigned as your attorney.

07:02.839 --> 07:07.003
Apologize it took me so long to get here,
but there was a mix-up in hospitals.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.371
I'd like to sit
and talk about tonight's events.

07:09.545 --> 07:12.776
Look, Mr. Monroe,
I didn't do anything wrong...

07:12.949 --> 07:15.816
...and I don't want an attorney.
- Yes, sergeant, you do.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.885
Okay.

07:23.459 --> 07:24.790
So I have an attorney.

07:26.596 --> 07:28.359
Captain Raydor.

07:30.099 --> 07:31.930
Are you Sergeant David Gabriel?

07:33.035 --> 07:34.969
- Yes, I am.
- As a sergeant...

07:35.138 --> 07:38.539
...I would expect you to be familiar
with the rules and regulations...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.871
...surrounding the use of your firearm.
- And you would be correct.

07:42.044 --> 07:45.707
Then why did you disregard L.A.P.D. policy
and leave the scene of your action?

07:45.882 --> 07:49.181
- I was following a direct...
- Please say nothing else.

07:49.352 --> 07:53.015
I see you've met your counsel, so I won't
bother asking you for your statement.

07:53.189 --> 07:56.352
But over here, there is this officer
with a breathalyzer...

07:56.526 --> 07:59.654
...and I would appreciate it
if you visited him immediately...

07:59.829 --> 08:01.854
...to assess your blood-alcohol level.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.791
Or, if you prefer,
your lawyer can explain...

08:04.967 --> 08:07.902
...the long-term consequences
of failing to do as I ask.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.669
Do you need help with the word
"immediately"?

08:26.422 --> 08:29.653
Captain Raydor,
it is so nice to finally meet you.

08:30.927 --> 08:36.660
So I was told that Sergeant Gabriel
and the victim had been sent to Cedars...

08:36.832 --> 08:39.494
...and here you all are at
St. Catherine's Medical Center.

08:39.669 --> 08:42.638
And I was just wondering
how is it that you happened to be...

08:42.804 --> 08:45.831
...at the right hospital,
while I was sent to the wrong one?

08:46.943 --> 08:49.503
If I may, I'd like to offer some advice.

08:49.679 --> 08:51.943
When investigating shootings like this...

08:52.114 --> 08:55.345
...I question the criminals
first before my fellow officers.

08:56.819 --> 09:00.346
When I have an unarmed civilian
sprayed by bullets...

09:00.523 --> 09:05.187
...from a member of the L.A.P.D.,
I expect cooperation.

09:05.361 --> 09:07.124
It encourages me.

09:07.296 --> 09:11.596
And if I could offer you some advice, uh,
while I am investigating this shooting...

09:11.767 --> 09:14.235
...be careful
where you place your sympathies.

09:15.271 --> 09:17.637
- Chief.
- Excuse me?

09:17.807 --> 09:20.207
"Be careful where you place
your sympathies, chief."

09:21.444 --> 09:24.675
You're a captain, a subordinate officer,
and you will remember that...

09:24.847 --> 09:27.577
...when addressing me.
Do I make myself clear, captain?

09:28.117 --> 09:30.085
Perfectly, chief.

09:31.220 --> 09:34.656
Excuse me. Got work to do.

09:55.144 --> 09:57.237
Kitty okay?
I thought I heard her throwing up.

09:57.413 --> 09:58.437
No, no.

10:00.082 --> 10:01.743
It's just... Just a little cough.

10:03.252 --> 10:05.743
- He's fine.
- She's fine.

10:08.090 --> 10:11.924
Are you sure? I could take her in today
instead of tomorrow.

10:12.094 --> 10:14.562
No, no, no.
She ate her whole breakfast.

10:14.730 --> 10:16.561
I don't wanna rush her
over to the vet.

10:16.732 --> 10:18.359
Let's not make too much of it.

10:21.270 --> 10:22.294
I gotta go.

10:22.471 --> 10:24.735
- Well, I could swear I...
- I'm late. No, I'm late.

10:24.907 --> 10:27.341
- I heard...
- Um, I'm late.

10:29.111 --> 10:31.238
Let's pause in this report for a moment...

10:31.414 --> 10:35.111
...to hear why you ignored policy and put
Sergeant Gabriel in an ambulance...

10:35.284 --> 10:38.219
...instead of waiting for the
black-and-whites, then sent FID...

10:38.387 --> 10:40.719
...to the wrong emergency room.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.826
I thought the paramedics
were going to Cedars. My apologies.

10:44.994 --> 10:48.725
I was off-duty. I had had several
alcoholic beverages on an empty stomach.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.991
You didn't seem at all drunk to me,
commander.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.990
Oh, thanks.

10:53.703 --> 10:56.831
Uh, well, regardless,
Erik Whitner is in stable condition.

10:57.006 --> 11:00.066
Sergeant Gabriel has met with his
counsel and given his statement.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.369
The only thing outstanding
is the homicide...

11:02.545 --> 11:04.740
...which no one has been allowed
to investigate.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.439
Chief Pope,
I spent the night familiarizing myself...

11:07.616 --> 11:10.176
...with Major Crimes...
Really, really impressive.

11:10.619 --> 11:12.883
I find no instance
where they've investigated...

11:13.055 --> 11:14.886
...the murder of a newspaper vendor...

11:15.057 --> 11:17.457
...whereas the shooting
of an unarmed civilian...

11:17.626 --> 11:20.186
...by an L.A.P.D. officer
incurs serious liability.

11:20.363 --> 11:22.160
It can't take priority over homicide.

11:22.331 --> 11:25.994
And perhaps Captain Raydor would
like to tell Mr. Parsall's family his murder...

11:26.168 --> 11:29.194
Chief Johnson is trying to combine
my officer-involved shooting...

11:29.372 --> 11:33.001
Are you interrupting me?
Captain, are you interrupting me?

11:33.175 --> 11:37.441
I must go first!
My investigation must go first!

11:41.584 --> 11:44.382
These attempts to pull rank
are embarrassing, unacceptable...

11:44.553 --> 11:46.987
...and potentially
an obstruction of justice.

11:47.156 --> 11:49.522
I have a federally
mandated responsibility...

11:49.692 --> 11:52.957
...to determine why an L.A.P.D. officer
discharged his weapon...

11:53.129 --> 11:57.498
...which supersedes Chief Johnson's
objections, as well as yours, sir.

11:58.701 --> 11:59.963
If it comes to that.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.001
- It won't.
- Thank you.

12:02.505 --> 12:04.496
Were there any witnesses
to this shooting?

12:04.673 --> 12:07.005
Yes, uh, a couple
saw a young white man...

12:07.176 --> 12:09.838
...shoot Mr. Parsall several times
at point-blank range...

12:10.012 --> 12:11.741
...empty his cash drawer
and run away.

12:11.914 --> 12:15.509
Erik Whitner had $2 in his pocket, had
no gun, wasn't ID'd by the witnesses.

12:15.684 --> 12:19.586
Then whoever murdered Mr. Parsall is still
out there. What if he shoots someone...

12:19.755 --> 12:21.746
...while Captain Raydor
refuses me access?

12:21.924 --> 12:25.223
Is it safe to assume the white male
who shot Mr. Parsall...

12:25.394 --> 12:26.884
...was not Sergeant Gabriel?

12:27.062 --> 12:29.690
- That is not the issue here.
- Then what is the issue?

12:29.865 --> 12:33.062
Clearly, Chief Johnson wants to combine
my case with her murder...

12:33.235 --> 12:36.534
...in order to protect
a well-liked member of her division.

12:38.274 --> 12:40.936
I will not allow my conduct
to be questioned like this.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.510
Especially when all I asked
Captain Raydor to do...

12:43.679 --> 12:46.273
...is to move her red tape
a few feet to the left...

12:46.449 --> 12:49.077
...so that I can properly begin
searching for a murderer.

12:50.052 --> 12:52.520
All right, Captain Raydor,
you seem to be insisting...

12:52.688 --> 12:55.680
...that this officer-involved shooting
and the Parsall murder...

12:55.858 --> 12:57.758
...are two separate events.

12:57.927 --> 13:01.260
That's exactly what they are and I need
to be allowed to work my case...

13:01.430 --> 13:03.398
...before Chief Johnson...
- No, no, no.

13:03.566 --> 13:07.593
If Erik Whitner's not the shooter, then Major
Crimes needs to look for the real killer.

13:07.770 --> 13:12.070
You and Chief Johnson will share
the crime scene and the witnesses...

13:12.241 --> 13:15.369
...but Sergeant Gabriel is not to take
part in this investigation...

13:15.544 --> 13:18.638
...until this officer-involved shooting
is completely explained.

13:24.086 --> 13:25.917
Chief Johnson, wait.

13:26.088 --> 13:29.854
I wanna say that I understand the urge
to protect the people you work with...

13:30.025 --> 13:31.185
...and I respect it.

13:31.360 --> 13:35.091
But I'm obligated to investigate this
shooting as if it were a criminal act.

13:35.264 --> 13:37.562
And I would ask that you do nothing...

13:37.733 --> 13:40.463
...to jeopardize the success of my inquiry,
that's all.

13:40.636 --> 13:43.696
You stay out of my way, captain,
I'll stay out of yours.

13:45.608 --> 13:48.668
Well. I tried.

13:52.448 --> 13:53.915
Careful, chief.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.382
She's part of Internal Affairs,
and she can carry a grudge.

13:57.553 --> 14:01.421
Well, then, she better get ready
for some heavy lifting.

14:05.828 --> 14:08.262
I remember Raydor back
when she was a Sergeant.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.990
Filed a complaint against my old partner
George Andrews.

14:11.166 --> 14:15.034
Said he was misogynistic, heh.
We had to look it up.

14:15.204 --> 14:18.605
Got both of us four months
of sensitivity training.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.605
Well, that
was a complete waste of time.

14:21.143 --> 14:25.307
- Doctor? Anything?
- Well, ugh, he's definitely dead.

14:25.481 --> 14:29.247
There's also this stippling around
each wound.

14:29.418 --> 14:32.012
Basically gunpowder burns.
But they're not spread out...

14:32.187 --> 14:35.816
...which tells me Mr. Parsall was shot
at extremely close range.

14:36.425 --> 14:37.722
What's bothering you though?

14:37.893 --> 14:39.758
Usually, when bullets pierce the skin...

14:39.929 --> 14:42.261
...they tear the epidermis
and present a torn-edge.

14:42.431 --> 14:46.197
These wounds are clean. Round.

14:46.368 --> 14:49.098
The only reason I can think of
for this type of wound...

14:49.271 --> 14:51.831
...is that the bullet must have been...

14:53.242 --> 14:54.971
Ah, I'm right.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.908
- Wadcutters.
- Target rounds?

14:58.080 --> 15:02.642
Flat tip. Leave clean, round holes in paper,
so you can tell the exact entrance point.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.945
Yeah, well,
finding the exact entrance point?

15:05.120 --> 15:06.747
Not a problem we had with this guy.

15:08.057 --> 15:11.720
The average target round
is accurate only over short distances.

15:11.894 --> 15:16.854
And because the bullet is flat tipped,
they're not used in magazines or clips.

15:17.032 --> 15:20.092
Jams too easily. Which means
the murder weapon is probably...

15:20.269 --> 15:21.896
- A revolver.
- Which would explain...

15:22.071 --> 15:24.335
...why there were no casings
at the crime scene.

15:24.506 --> 15:28.169
Sergeant, please. You're not allowed
to be part of this investigation.

15:28.711 --> 15:30.338
- Yes, Lieutenant?
- Chief...

15:30.512 --> 15:33.879
...a revolver would explain why there
were no casings at the crime scene.

15:34.049 --> 15:37.849
Thank you. What do we know about
the couple who witnessed the shooting?

15:38.020 --> 15:42.514
Okay, ahem. Well,
that was Ron and Tina Drake.

15:42.691 --> 15:46.388
They were sitting in their car
by the curb for an hour or so.

15:46.562 --> 15:50.658
- And they saw the robbery and the murder.
- What were they doing in car...

15:50.833 --> 15:53.199
...for an hour?
- Well, they're a divorced couple.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.429
- You know, working things out.
- Oh, good for them.

15:56.605 --> 16:00.302
A relationship based on love
is worth fighting for.

16:02.144 --> 16:03.736
Isn't it?

16:04.346 --> 16:06.075
Who are you?

16:06.548 --> 16:09.574
Chief, the Drakes said
they got a good look at the shooter...

16:09.752 --> 16:12.653
...as the robbery started but ducked
down in their car after...

16:12.821 --> 16:16.655
...and when they were showed a photo
of Whitner, they had no idea who he was.

16:18.027 --> 16:21.554
You know what I was thinking, ahem? What
do you get when you rob a newsstand?

16:21.730 --> 16:25.894
Like, what, $38 in quarters?
Maybe Mr. Parsall pissed somebody off...

16:26.068 --> 16:28.593
...they killed him,
and the robbery was incidental.

16:28.771 --> 16:33.538
- What do we know about Mr. Parsall?
- He immigrated from Israel, uh, in 2000.

16:33.709 --> 16:37.167
He was naturalized in 2004.
Besides owning the newsstand...

16:37.346 --> 16:40.509
...volunteered at a Jewish Community
Center twice a week. No record.

16:40.683 --> 16:42.514
So if it wasn't a robbery, what was it?

16:43.952 --> 16:45.419
Uh, Chief Johnson?

16:45.587 --> 16:47.851
Uh, Buzz, we're not ready to go
to the crime scene.

16:48.023 --> 16:50.787
That's fine. I stepped in to tell
you I can't come with you.

16:50.959 --> 16:51.983
What? Why not?

16:52.161 --> 16:54.288
The other detectives
say they never got word...

16:54.463 --> 16:56.488
...from Captain Raydor to let civilians in.

16:56.665 --> 16:59.156
- But you work for us.
- I know.

16:59.334 --> 17:01.700
Oh, that woman!

17:03.539 --> 17:05.837
Never mind. We're all going.

17:06.008 --> 17:08.636
Lieutenant Tao,
would you bring your bag of tricks?

17:08.810 --> 17:12.645
- Sergeant Gabriel, You're coming too.
- You just said I wasn't a part of this.

17:12.815 --> 17:14.806
But you're a witness.
And I need witnesses.

17:22.958 --> 17:26.121
- Hey! What are you doing?
- We're headed to the newsstand.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.855
Pick a paper,
read about the FID guys who got fired...

17:29.031 --> 17:31.329
...because they disregarded orders
from the Pope.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.367
- Listen, I'm not gonna...
- Tone, tone, tone.

17:34.536 --> 17:37.266
That's no way to talk to a lieutenant
or a deputy chief.

17:37.439 --> 17:39.999
If you do anything to interfere
with my investigation...

17:40.175 --> 17:42.871
...I'll see to it you spend
the next month on unpaid leave.

17:43.045 --> 17:45.639
Is that understood? Okay, Buzz.

17:45.814 --> 17:51.878
Buzz, start filming everything over here
including the unhappy officers there.

17:53.455 --> 17:55.423
"S. G." Sergeant Gabriel.

17:55.591 --> 17:58.219
Stands for "suspect guilty"
as far as FID's concerned.

17:58.393 --> 18:02.420
Okay. This is where you said you
were standing when you fired your weapon?

18:02.598 --> 18:06.500
Now, Lieutenant Flynn, would you please
play the part of Erik Whitner?

18:08.403 --> 18:11.839
Thank you. All right, sergeant.
Please return to this mark.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.168
Thank you and Buzz, could you...?

18:14.810 --> 18:16.243
Buzz?

18:17.045 --> 18:19.536
- Where is Buzz?
- Right here.

18:24.953 --> 18:26.511
Chief, what are you thinking?

18:27.289 --> 18:30.554
What if there was someone else
involved in the shooting of Mr. Parsall?

18:30.726 --> 18:34.628
- What? Like a second gunman?
- Like a lone gunman with an accomplice.

18:34.797 --> 18:37.891
Yeah, but I saw the gun fire from
where Flynn is standing.

18:38.066 --> 18:41.627
In your statement, you said you saw
the flash of a gun, not the gun itself.

18:41.804 --> 18:45.069
So, just like I couldn't see Buzz standing
behind Lieutenant Flynn...

18:45.240 --> 18:48.801
...it's possible that you didn't see
the gunman standing behind Erik Whitner.

18:48.977 --> 18:51.605
Yeah... Yeah, but it couldn't be like that.
I mean, how could it?

18:51.780 --> 18:53.645
- Syzygy.
- Huh?

18:54.082 --> 18:57.643
Syzygy. It means when three things
in a row, like, um, an eclipse.

18:57.820 --> 19:00.380
When the Earth, the moon
and the sun are in alignment...

19:00.556 --> 19:05.220
...or in this case, Gabriel, Erik Whitner,
and someone else.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.992
Divorced couple were sitting
in their car for an hour...

19:10.165 --> 19:11.996
...so to the shooter and his lookout...

19:12.167 --> 19:14.567
...this whole area
would have appeared deserted.

19:14.736 --> 19:18.365
The lookout, Erik, signaled to someone
else that the coast was clear.

19:18.540 --> 19:21.941
And if that someone else murdered
Parsall and then fired at Gabriel...

19:22.110 --> 19:23.737
...as he was making his escape...

19:23.912 --> 19:26.676
...those shots could have looked like
they came from Erik.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.444
Wait a minute. So, what are you saying?
You think I shot an unarmed kid?

19:33.522 --> 19:37.253
There were no bullet impacts behind
where Sergeant Gabriel was standing.

19:39.027 --> 19:43.396
Sergeant, would you turn over
your firearm, please?

19:49.304 --> 19:50.396
Thank you.

19:50.572 --> 19:52.836
And Lieutenant Tao,
can I have a clip of blanks please?

19:53.008 --> 19:54.032
Hmm.

19:56.044 --> 19:58.103
- Oh, here you go, Chief.
- Thank you.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.111
Okay, everyone stand behind me, please.

20:05.153 --> 20:07.485
I'm firing a weapon with blanks.

20:07.656 --> 20:11.217
There is no need to be alarmed.
There is no need to be alarmed.

20:16.899 --> 20:19.197
There's no way
you were standing on this mark...

20:19.368 --> 20:21.302
...when you fired your weapon.
- Yeah.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.667
He would have been standing
more near here.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.763
Yeah.

21:02.244 --> 21:04.576
Looks like a wadcutter.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.276
Thank you, Lieutenant.

21:25.734 --> 21:28.897
Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen.
Where's Erik Whitner?

21:29.071 --> 21:30.538
Uh, in his room. Uh, asleep, I think.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.506
His parents and attorney
are waiting outside there.

21:34.676 --> 21:39.409
It's not exactly
a, uh, police-friendly situation here.

21:39.915 --> 21:42.247
Yeah, ballistics matched the bullet
found at the scene...

21:42.417 --> 21:44.282
...with the bullets that killed Parsall.

21:44.453 --> 21:47.081
Whoever killed our victim
also fired at Sergeant Gabriel.

21:47.255 --> 21:49.689
It doesn't prove Erik
was involved in the crime.

21:49.858 --> 21:51.689
Even with what he said
in the ambulance.

21:51.860 --> 21:54.294
So it's still David's word
against this kid.

21:56.598 --> 21:59.192
I hate to ask you this
since it's against your nature...

21:59.368 --> 22:03.771
...but, um, do you think that you could
distract Erik's parents and his lawyer...

22:03.939 --> 22:05.930
...sort of irritate them down the hall?

22:06.608 --> 22:08.439
After you.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.343
Lieutenant Flynn, L.A.P.D.

22:14.516 --> 22:17.451
We'd like to talk about your
son. I have important information.

22:17.619 --> 22:19.849
Over to the waiting room.
Be a bit more private.

22:34.636 --> 22:37.662
- Who are you?
- I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson...

22:37.839 --> 22:39.033
...of the L.A.P.D.

22:39.207 --> 22:42.142
I'm so sorry to awaken you
when you're feeling unwell.

22:42.310 --> 22:46.371
- But I have a few questions.
- I already talked to the other lady.

22:46.548 --> 22:49.574
I'm here because you may have
witnessed the actual murder.

22:50.719 --> 22:52.778
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.651
You don't remember another man
being shot the night before last?

22:58.293 --> 23:01.285
Well, that happens sometimes, uh...

23:01.463 --> 23:05.092
The trauma of being wounded
can affect your recollections...

23:05.267 --> 23:07.030
...but the killer ran right past you.

23:07.202 --> 23:10.103
He was as close to you
as I am right now.

23:10.272 --> 23:13.400
Okay, I don't want you in here any more.
Please leave.

23:14.076 --> 23:16.772
Hey. Hey, you can't do that.

23:17.846 --> 23:20.872
Dad? Hey, Mom?

23:22.851 --> 23:25.012
- I am not gonna talk to you.
- That's okay.

23:25.187 --> 23:26.814
You can just listen, I got plenty to say.

23:28.190 --> 23:30.420
The officer who rode with you
in the ambulance told me...

23:30.592 --> 23:32.992
...you said some things to him
on the way to the ER.

23:33.161 --> 23:37.325
- "Nobody was supposed to get hurt."
- I didn't say anything to him. He shot me.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.491
- Why would I say anything?
- You'd be amazed at what people say...

23:40.669 --> 23:42.933
...when they think
they're about to meet God.

23:43.105 --> 23:46.199
Because they're sorry
or guilty or afraid.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.471
- I wasn't dying.
- You thought you were.

23:48.643 --> 23:51.339
"Please don't let me die."

23:51.513 --> 23:53.640
- Sound familiar?
- No.

23:55.050 --> 23:59.714
Erik, have you ever heard of the term
"transferred intent?"

23:59.888 --> 24:04.154
It means that if a homicide occurs
during the commission of a felony...

24:04.326 --> 24:06.021
...say, armed robbery...

24:06.194 --> 24:09.254
...that everybody involved
is as responsible for the murder...

24:09.431 --> 24:11.592
...as the guy who pulled the trigger.

24:11.766 --> 24:13.393
Even if they were just a lookout...

24:13.568 --> 24:16.503
...and didn't see the car with witnesses
sitting at the curb.

24:16.671 --> 24:18.866
I didn't do anything.
I was just standing there.

24:19.841 --> 24:22.776
- Why were you just standing there?
- Doesn't matter why.

24:22.944 --> 24:25.879
- You can't arrest me for anything.
- Not right now, Erik...

24:26.047 --> 24:29.539
...but I am coming after you. I'm gonna
prove you murdered Howard Parsall...

24:29.718 --> 24:32.414
...even if I have to use
transferred intent to do it.

24:32.587 --> 24:34.316
Do you wanna go
to the gas chamber...

24:34.489 --> 24:37.424
...because someone else
committed a murder?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.327
Come on. Who was with you
the night before last?

24:40.495 --> 24:42.963
Who shot Mr. Parsall?
Who shot at the police?

24:45.267 --> 24:48.065
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm talking to your son.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.501
- Without his lawyer present?
- Discussing a murder, not your civil case.

24:51.673 --> 24:53.334
This is all going into the lawsuit.

24:53.508 --> 24:55.738
What's with you people?
You care more about...

24:55.911 --> 24:58.243
...investigating some dead Arab
than you do my son.

25:06.788 --> 25:07.914
- Oh.
- Chief Johnson.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.614
Ricardo. Of course. How are you?

25:10.792 --> 25:14.319
Would you gentlemen excuse us
just for one moment, please?

25:16.264 --> 25:18.789
- Here about the boy?
- Cop shooting an unarmed teenager.

25:18.967 --> 25:21.993
It's a big story. Of course,
Taylor keeps shutting me out.

25:22.170 --> 25:23.967
I figured see what the boy has to say.

25:24.139 --> 25:26.607
- If you wait a day...
- It's already been two, Chief.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.710
Pretty soon it's gonna be old news.
I can't let that happen.

25:29.878 --> 25:33.370
This case may be more than
just an officer-involved shooting.

25:33.548 --> 25:35.812
Really? How so?

25:36.518 --> 25:38.452
Well, I'm not at liberty to say today.

25:39.955 --> 25:43.220
But look, look, look,
I'm offering you an exclusive.

25:46.027 --> 25:48.495
All right. Twenty-four hours.
It better be worth it.

25:48.663 --> 25:50.426
It will.

25:54.369 --> 25:56.564
I wanna know everything
about this Erik Whitner.

25:56.738 --> 26:00.299
Where he goes to school,
who his friends are, what his activities are.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.204
I'm beginning to think
this was a hate crime.

26:04.512 --> 26:06.844
Oh, sorry. One second.

26:07.015 --> 26:08.414
Hey, Fritzie.

26:08.583 --> 26:13.316
- Hey. Uh, what did Dr. Fleming say?
- Kitty isn't getting better.

26:14.856 --> 26:18.656
- What does that mean?
- Ugh, Brenda, there's just...

26:19.327 --> 26:21.818
All right. Listen, honey...

26:21.997 --> 26:26.297
...there is nothing else we can do
except try and keep Kitty comfortable.

26:26.468 --> 26:28.766
<i>- Or...
- Ugh, we need to get a second opinion.</i>

26:28.937 --> 26:30.234
No, listen to me.

26:30.405 --> 26:33.203
Do you really wanna put Kitty through
more needles and tests?

26:33.775 --> 26:37.302
<i>She has been loyal to you,
and loving, in every way.</i>

26:37.479 --> 26:39.709
And she has nothing but
suffering ahead of her.

26:39.881 --> 26:41.849
She's counting on us to stop that.

26:42.017 --> 26:45.180
But you know, Dr. Fleming said
that we could keep her comfortable.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.321
Try and keep her comfortable. Try.

26:47.489 --> 26:49.684
Look, do we need to talk
about this right now?

26:49.858 --> 26:53.294
No, we don't have to talk now because
you know what needs to be done here.

26:53.461 --> 26:56.521
But I can't do it. I can't do it.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.999
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:13.481 --> 27:14.880
- Chief Johnson.
- Yes.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.383
- Pope's in the office with Raydor.
- Oh, that woman.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.020
Chief.

27:20.188 --> 27:24.318
If the kid I shot was really unarmed,
maybe I should call my attorney and...

27:24.492 --> 27:29.361
No, Sergeant. Your attorney
will say what I'm going to say. Sit tight.

27:35.870 --> 27:37.735
- Hello.
- Chief Johnson.

27:37.906 --> 27:41.171
I told you to investigate a murder.
And now you're harassing a witness.

27:42.944 --> 27:45.435
Well, he's not a witness anymore.
He's a suspect.

27:45.613 --> 27:48.081
Are you in possession of evidence
I don't have?

27:48.616 --> 27:50.140
I don't know.

27:52.354 --> 27:53.753
Let's get this straight here.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.653
I have 72 hours after an L.A.P.D. officer
discharges his firearm...

27:57.826 --> 28:00.818
...to report to the chief of police
and the federal government...

28:00.995 --> 28:02.724
...as to the nature of the event.

28:02.897 --> 28:06.526
So if you are in possession of evidence
that I don't have...

28:06.701 --> 28:11.365
...it is required
that you give it to me for my report.

28:11.539 --> 28:15.134
You could have access to my evidence
when I finish investigating the murder.

28:15.877 --> 28:18.903
She isn't just investigating a murder.
She's working very hard...

28:19.080 --> 28:21.913
...to get Sgt. Gabriel off the hook
for shooting my victim...

28:22.083 --> 28:25.644
...and she's impeding federal justice.
- I am the one with the victim.

28:26.421 --> 28:28.548
And you're protecting the suspect
from justice.

28:28.723 --> 28:31.521
The opposite is true here, actually,
Chief Johnson.

28:31.693 --> 28:35.151
You are protecting Sergeant Gabriel,
my suspect...

28:35.330 --> 28:37.821
...as well as badgering the witness.
- How?

28:37.999 --> 28:40.229
Uh, by threatening Erik
with the death penalty.

28:41.035 --> 28:44.732
All I did was give an 18-year-old boy
some free legal advice.

28:44.906 --> 28:47.739
Transferred intent
can be a difficult concept to grasp.

28:47.909 --> 28:51.276
Your conduct during this investigation
has begun to seriously threaten...

28:51.446 --> 28:52.845
...a federal inquiry.

28:53.515 --> 28:55.745
Look, Captain,
you were the one who insisted...

28:55.917 --> 28:57.942
...that these were two separate cases.

28:58.119 --> 29:00.986
But, Chief Johnson,
according to Erik Whitner's attorney...

29:01.156 --> 29:03.590
...who called me to complain
about your harassment...

29:03.758 --> 29:06.124
...a little sensitivity
might be called for.

29:06.294 --> 29:09.957
The Whitners recently lost a family
member in the war in Afghanistan. Now...

29:10.131 --> 29:12.463
...two weeks later,
to have their son shot up...

29:12.634 --> 29:16.695
Wait, what...? Who?
Who in the family died?

29:16.871 --> 29:21.205
Gunnery Sergeant William M. Roth.
Mrs. Whitner's older brother.

29:21.376 --> 29:24.209
Marine sharpshooter killed
in Afghanistan 19 days ago...

29:24.379 --> 29:26.847
...when mortar fire
hit his transport vehicle.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.883
So Mr. Parsall's murder
could have been revenge...

29:31.052 --> 29:33.885
...for Erik's uncle's death
in the Middle East.

29:34.055 --> 29:36.956
Yeah, but, uh, Mr. Parsall is from Israel.

29:37.125 --> 29:40.219
It isn't always easy to tell
who's from where in the Middle East.

29:40.395 --> 29:43.262
And where did, uh,
Gunnery Sergeant Roth live?

29:43.431 --> 29:46.332
Yeah, 1066 Sylmore Avenue, uh,
Panorama City.

29:46.501 --> 29:49.061
A search on the Roth family address
shows a complaint...

29:49.237 --> 29:52.570
...was filed against them by their neighbor.
- A complaint? For what?

29:52.740 --> 29:56.642
Uh, shots fired. Turns out
Gunnery Sergeant Roth's son, Billy...

29:56.811 --> 29:59.075
...who happens to be
Erik Whitner's cousin...

29:59.247 --> 30:03.479
...was playing target practice
with his neighbor's fence just last week.

30:17.565 --> 30:21.797
- Uh, I regret filing that complaint.
- Why is that, sir?

30:21.970 --> 30:25.531
I didn't know it, but Billy's dad
died in Afghanistan a little while ago.

30:25.707 --> 30:28.608
I'm sure the kid
was just blowing off some steam.

30:28.776 --> 30:31.210
The fence is old anyway.
Needs to be replaced.

30:32.013 --> 30:33.605
I should have let it go.

30:34.983 --> 30:36.974
- Ah, Tao.
- Hmm?

30:44.292 --> 30:47.420
You know, I cant get to it
without entering the Roth property...

30:47.595 --> 30:51.588
...and there's no one home to ask.
- Not home, right.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.894
Uh, Detective Sanchez,
why don't you go ahead and give it a try.

30:58.840 --> 31:02.537
- Sir?
- Oh, hey, be my guest.

31:05.580 --> 31:06.911
Oh.

31:09.717 --> 31:11.912
Looks like a wadcutter.

31:14.822 --> 31:18.588
Six lands with a left twist.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.320
I'll have to confirm it,
but I think we have a match.

31:21.496 --> 31:23.964
Lt. Flynn,
I think that buys us a search warrant.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.862
- Already on it, Chief.
- Okay.

31:27.035 --> 31:29.003
Now, where are the Roths, I wonder.

31:30.405 --> 31:32.339
- En route to Nebraska.
- Ugh.

31:32.507 --> 31:35.203
Apparently, the Roths
booked a family trip to grandma's...

31:35.376 --> 31:39.107
...after you visited with Erik. Omaha P.D.
is waiting for them at the airport.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.680
How did the tests go on the revolver
we found?

31:41.849 --> 31:43.111
Matches the bullets.

31:43.284 --> 31:46.549
Uh, plus, Sanchez put a picture
of Billy Roth in a six-pack...

31:46.721 --> 31:49.622
...and each witness separately
ID'd him as the shooter.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.128
Uh, Ricardo, would you mind?

31:56.664 --> 32:00.395
Look, we won't have the kid in our custody
for at least another 48 hours.

32:00.568 --> 32:04.095
Can't wait that long. Captain Raydor
needs to report to the chief tomorrow.

32:04.806 --> 32:06.797
I'm gonna have to get
what I need from Erik.

32:06.975 --> 32:12.072
Chief, I don't think the parents and lawyer
are gonna fall for the same trick twice.

32:18.353 --> 32:22.289
<i>Mr. And Mrs. Whitner. Hi. My name
is Ricardo Ramos. I work for The Times...</i>

32:22.457 --> 32:24.550
...and I'd like to ask a few questions.

32:25.293 --> 32:27.921
- We're not giving statements.
- Oh, I don't need a statement.

32:28.096 --> 32:31.190
I, uh, need a perspective.
Your perspective.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.164
You see, you have a story
that needs to be told...

32:34.335 --> 32:38.169
...and I wanna be the one to tell it.
I'll even buy the coffee.

32:40.475 --> 32:43.239
- Okay.
- Great.

32:50.118 --> 32:51.710
Hello, Erik.

32:52.687 --> 32:54.018
You're not supposed to be in here.

32:56.157 --> 32:59.422
Do you remember that legal term
I explained to you? Transferred intent?

33:00.428 --> 33:04.592
You don't need to worry about it anymore
because I just spoke to your cousin, Billy.

33:05.967 --> 33:09.027
- What are you talking about?
- Billy told me that the two of you...

33:09.203 --> 33:13.264
...were just gonna hassle Mr. Parsall.
But you had other ideas once you got there.

33:18.112 --> 33:21.479
Do you recognize this gun? You should.

33:21.649 --> 33:25.779
We've just confirmed it
as the weapon used to kill Mr. Parsall.

33:25.953 --> 33:27.250
That's...

33:28.056 --> 33:31.150
That's not mine. I didn't do anything.

33:32.794 --> 33:35.695
I told you I was coming after you, Erik.
And here I am.

33:35.863 --> 33:39.560
I have the murder weapon, your cousin's
statement saying you're the shooter...

33:39.734 --> 33:42.430
...that you fired at police
and that after you were shot...

33:42.603 --> 33:46.130
...he grabbed the gun and ran away.
Which means I have you for homicide.

33:46.307 --> 33:49.071
You are under arrest
for the murder of Howard Parsall.

33:49.243 --> 33:51.803
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

33:51.979 --> 33:55.073
...can be used against you.
You have the right to an attorney.

33:55.249 --> 33:57.979
If you can't afford the attorney,
council will be provided.

33:58.152 --> 34:00.586
- Stop and let me explain.
- You waive your rights?

34:00.755 --> 34:04.885
- Yeah, fine, yes. Just let me explain.
- What's going on in here?

34:05.526 --> 34:07.517
No, this is my son's room.
You have no right.

34:07.695 --> 34:10.061
Your parents can't help you now, Erik.
Only me.

34:10.231 --> 34:12.426
Talk to me.
Tell me what happened?

34:12.600 --> 34:15.330
Or I'm gonna have to go
with Billy's side of the story.

34:15.503 --> 34:19.166
- You can kiss your life goodbye.
- I didn't know about the gun. I thought...

34:19.340 --> 34:21.808
...we were gonna kick the guy's ass
or something.

34:22.543 --> 34:24.875
- Because he's Middle Eastern?
- Because he's Muslim.

34:25.045 --> 34:27.139
Because we're at war with the Muslims.

34:29.884 --> 34:33.445
Listen, I didn't know Billy was going to
shoot that guy. I didn't know.

34:34.054 --> 34:36.387
I just wanted to scare him.
You have to believe me.

34:36.556 --> 34:41.119
- Billy is the one who shot him, not me.
- And after Billy shot Mr. Parsall?

34:41.295 --> 34:43.855
He took the money out of the register,
started to run.

34:44.031 --> 34:45.828
Until you heard
someone telling you "stop."

34:47.235 --> 34:50.261
And I stopped and I turned around
and started to raise my hands.

34:50.438 --> 34:54.931
But Billy was standing behind you,
and he fired at the officer?

34:55.376 --> 34:57.537
Yes. Yeah, he shot at him. Yeah.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.203
How many times?

35:01.649 --> 35:03.378
- How many times?
- Twice, I think.

35:04.552 --> 35:07.020
Look, nobody
was supposed to get hurt.

35:07.755 --> 35:10.417
That's what you said to Sergeant Gabriel
in the ambulance.

35:10.591 --> 35:14.721
- "Nobody was supposed to get hurt."
- Yeah. That is what I said.

35:14.896 --> 35:16.158
And now look at me.

35:17.165 --> 35:18.598
Well...

35:20.201 --> 35:24.399
The good news is that the doctors say
that you're gonna make a full recovery.

35:24.572 --> 35:27.837
Unfortunately,
the same can't be said for Mr. Parsall.

35:31.479 --> 35:33.913
Oh, and, uh, for your information...

35:34.081 --> 35:37.016
...Howard Parsall,
the Arab that your cousin murdered...

35:37.185 --> 35:40.985
...he wasn't an Arab,
and he wasn't a Muslim.

35:41.155 --> 35:44.420
He was an American citizen,
and he was Jewish.

35:45.827 --> 35:47.260
You shot the wrong guy.

35:51.265 --> 35:53.893
Hey. Hey! I didn't shoot anybody!

35:54.068 --> 35:57.367
This is against the law. You cannot
come in here and accost my son.

35:57.538 --> 35:58.903
I'm not accosting your son.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.439
I'm arresting him for murder
in the first degree.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.603
- Provenza, would you please do the honors?
- My pleasure, chief.

36:12.820 --> 36:13.844
Ricardo.

36:14.021 --> 36:16.080
- I helped you out.
- Thank you for that.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.725
- And we had a deal.
- We did.

36:19.560 --> 36:23.724
And, uh, I think I know
what your exclusive should be, hopefully.

36:23.898 --> 36:26.059
And hopefully, that will be what?

36:26.234 --> 36:31.763
The headline should read,
"L.A.P.D. sergeant cleared of all charges."

36:38.846 --> 36:42.145
So tell the shrink
if you had to do over again...

36:42.316 --> 36:44.409
...you don't know
how you'd do it differently.

36:44.585 --> 36:47.019
Say shooting the kid made you upset,
not too upset...

36:47.188 --> 36:51.488
...because you were being shot at too.
So you're happy to be alive.

36:52.360 --> 36:56.763
Say you feel for the kid,
even though he participated in a murder.

36:57.632 --> 37:03.434
And they're going to ask you
how many nights a week do you drink?

37:07.675 --> 37:09.006
Keep it under three.

37:11.279 --> 37:15.613
- Yeah. Yeah, that's good.
- Sergeant Gabriel?

37:17.585 --> 37:18.916
Will you join us, please?

37:26.460 --> 37:28.951
Thank you, commander.

37:29.764 --> 37:30.788
Thank you, Julio.

37:35.636 --> 37:39.003
So, uh, as you know,
Erik Whitner's cousin Billy Roth...

37:39.173 --> 37:42.074
...has been arrested
for the murder of Mr. Parsall...

37:42.243 --> 37:45.542
...and attempted murder
of a police officer.

37:45.713 --> 37:48.978
Erik Whitner has also been charged
with the murder of Mr. Parsall...

37:49.150 --> 37:51.812
...though I fully expect the DA
to make a deal with him...

37:51.986 --> 37:53.886
...in return for his testimony.

37:54.055 --> 37:56.922
Does that comport with your version
of events, Captain Raydor?

37:57.091 --> 38:00.959
It does, now that I have
all the information you withheld.

38:02.330 --> 38:07.290
- And is there anything else?
- Yeah, there is.

38:08.602 --> 38:12.971
Sergeant Gabriel, the district attorney
has reviewed FID's report...

38:13.140 --> 38:16.439
...and upon our recommendation,
is not filing charges against you.

38:16.610 --> 38:20.774
So once behavioral science has
signed off, you are cleared for full duty.

38:21.949 --> 38:25.009
- Thank you, captain.
- You're very welcome.

38:27.154 --> 38:28.178
Is that all, chief?

38:28.356 --> 38:31.018
Uh, well, I do wanna express
my appreciation...

38:31.192 --> 38:34.787
...for the insight that you've given me
into how FID functions.

38:34.962 --> 38:39.023
I have learned a great deal
from your single-minded approach.

38:41.102 --> 38:45.539
And I have learned a great deal
about your investigative technique as well...

38:45.706 --> 38:50.370
...especially as it regards L.A.P.D.'s struggle
to regain autonomy over its own affairs.

38:50.544 --> 38:56.676
And I'll be including all of that
in my final report, chief.

38:56.851 --> 38:58.716
Oh, I can't wait to read that, captain.

39:00.321 --> 39:01.447
Hmm.

39:07.094 --> 39:10.723
Sergeant, do not doubt yourself on this.

39:11.198 --> 39:13.689
You acted properly, legally,
and decisively...

39:13.868 --> 39:16.735
...to protect the public safety.
- By shooting an unarmed kid.

39:16.904 --> 39:19.896
Law considers him every bit as guilty
as the boy holding the gun.

39:20.074 --> 39:23.373
Yeah, well, I understand
how the law sees it. I just, um...

39:24.612 --> 39:26.546
I see it a little differently.

39:29.283 --> 39:33.583
But I do wanna thank you, chief,
for being there for me.

39:34.889 --> 39:38.450
Well, if I'm gonna be upset with you
when you're wrong...

39:38.626 --> 39:42.392
...Sergeant, the least I can do
is stand up for you when you're right.

40:53.167 --> 40:55.260
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:59.140 --> 41:02.576
I made arrangements for someone
to be with Kitty during the day, so...

41:02.743 --> 41:04.233
No, no, no. You're right.

41:05.346 --> 41:07.746
I've been thinking about it and...

41:08.983 --> 41:12.714
...I've only been looking
at how hard this is on me...

41:13.654 --> 41:14.678
...not Kitty.

41:16.257 --> 41:18.282
It's not what she deserves.

41:20.628 --> 41:23.290
Dr. Fleming's coming over right now.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.366
And, uh, we're gonna do it here.

41:27.134 --> 41:31.434
So that her last moments
aren't in some examination room.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.267
I just...
I wanna do the right thing by her.

41:37.178 --> 41:40.705
- This is the right thing, isn't it?
