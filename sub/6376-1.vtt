00:02.869 --> 00:04.734
<i>Last season on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:04.771 --> 00:06.363
You're our newest features editor.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.306
Oh, my God!

00:09.876 --> 00:11.639
Cal and I have been talking,

00:11.678 --> 00:15.307
and we decided we need
to reevaluate your role in the company.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.277
Connor Owens.
- You want him alive?

00:17.317 --> 00:19.512
As long as I get the money,
I really don't care.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.449
What are you doing here?

00:22.756 --> 00:24.553
I'm sick. It's cancer.

00:24.591 --> 00:27.492
<i>The only thing I care about
is the time we have left.</i>

00:28.995 --> 00:30.690
I'm moving in with Matt.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.061
- Do you love him?
- I do.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.759
<i>I guess this is goodbye.</i>

00:35.502 --> 00:37.265
- What are you saying?
- We're over.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.430
You're just gonna walk away,
I'm never gonna see you again?

00:39.472 --> 00:41.770
<i>My dad offered me a job at Mode
and I'm going to take it.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:43.036
I'm your new boss.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.888
They were like gnarly monster teeth.
Like...

01:39.099 --> 01:43.433
Like Gollum or someone
from the deep backwoods of England.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.268
You're just nervous
about your first day as a features editor.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.900
That's true.
I read a book about dreams

01:48.942 --> 01:51.638
that says teeth dreams means
you have anxiety.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.373
Or menopause.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.108
But I don't think that's the case here.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.275
When are those things
coming off anyway?

01:57.317 --> 02:00.445
Soon. The orthodontist scheduled me
for a few months from now.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.546
Ah, it's about freaking time.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.147
Yay!

02:04.190 --> 02:06.249
Hey, Hilda, do you think
you could trim my bangs?

02:06.292 --> 02:08.954
Maybe, but I'm kind of liking the look.

02:08.995 --> 02:10.985
Yeah, I kind of can't see.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.497
Good morning!

02:12.532 --> 02:13.863
- Hey!
- Hi!

02:13.900 --> 02:15.868
- Justin, my little man!
- First day of school!

02:15.902 --> 02:18.666
Justin, what did you dream
about last night?

02:18.705 --> 02:21.731
That Susan Boyle was force-feeding me
grilled cheese sandwiches

02:21.774 --> 02:23.071
and then morphed into a cat.

02:23.109 --> 02:24.940
See? Anxiety dream.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.947
Hey, nice shirt. Let me see. Zegna?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.973
Gucci. But you're getting better at this.
Thanks, Mom.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.343
Please.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.080
I figured we've got to
break out the labels

02:34.120 --> 02:36.520
for your first day of high school.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.389
Can't afford college now,
but at least you'll be styling.

02:39.425 --> 02:43.361
Oh, oh! Speaking of styling... Betty!

02:43.396 --> 02:45.489
Straight from Edinburgh!

02:45.532 --> 02:48.467
Yeah, Christina asked me to wait
to give this to you until today.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.766
- Oh, Christina.
- I know.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.873
A pantsuit? It's great.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.140
But it's just... It's not really me.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.549
Guys, I've got to go.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.679
Wait, wait, first day photo op!

03:06.719 --> 03:10.917
Come on, come on, squeeze together,
freshman and freshwoman.

03:10.957 --> 03:15.326
All right, ready?
Everybody say, "First day!"

03:15.361 --> 03:17.352
- First day!
- First day!

03:17.931 --> 03:21.594
News flash!
Wilhelmina Slater is on the outs!

03:21.634 --> 03:23.727
Meade savior, Cal Hartley,

03:23.770 --> 03:27.467
is continuing to throw his metaphorical
muscle behind Claire Meade,

03:27.507 --> 03:30.840
who is now de facto boss
at the publishing powerhouse.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.335
And it's no secret
that Claire is a Slater hater.

03:34.380 --> 03:38.373
With any claim to the company
now gone with Faux Baby Meade,

03:38.418 --> 03:40.978
it might be time for Wilhelmina
to dust off her résumé

03:41.020 --> 03:43.989
and figure out
what color her parachute is.

03:44.023 --> 03:48.983
In the meantime, hottie widower
Daniel Meade is apparently in Tibet.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.428
Is Daniel now a Dalai?

03:51.464 --> 03:55.400
Our sources say he may be there
spreading his late wife's ashes.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.767
A moment of silence for Molly.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.604
Moment over.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.269
<i>Daniel, get back here
and get back on the market, pronto!</i>

04:04.310 --> 04:07.143
<i>Page Six is a little lighter without you.</i>

04:10.316 --> 04:12.409
You have got to stop doing that.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.283
I only have so much glassware.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.350
Hide!

04:21.527 --> 04:24.496
Morning. I come bearing dry cleaning.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.499
With extra plastic for the landfills,
just how you like it.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.125
Marc, you could have
brought those to the office.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.533
I know, but you've been
so in and out lately,

04:30.570 --> 04:31.832
I didn't know
if you were gonna be in today,

04:31.871 --> 04:32.895
and so I just thought I'd stop off...

04:32.939 --> 04:34.372
Too many words, Marc.
I'll see you at the office.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.137
- Wait. Can I use your bathroom?
- No, Marc, you can't use my bathroom.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.076
No one uses my bathroom.
Not even me.

04:42.248 --> 04:43.806
What was that?

04:44.751 --> 04:48.585
- Housekeeper.
- But I thought we had her deported.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.355
Willie, what's going on?
You're being weird.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.916
And what was that stuff
in the news today? Is that true?

04:53.960 --> 04:57.487
Oh, Marc, how many times
have we planted damaging rumors

04:57.530 --> 04:59.760
in the news for self-serving reasons?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.824
Don't you worry your silky little curls.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.563
But I got a message
from Claire and Hartley.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.127
And they want to meet with you tonight.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.729
- Fine.
- But what if they, you know...

05:06.773 --> 05:08.798
And then you have to...

05:08.841 --> 05:10.399
Now not enough words, Marc.

05:10.443 --> 05:13.378
What if they fire you?
What happens to us?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.211
We will blow up that bridge
when we get to it.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.240
Now if you will excuse me.

05:36.402 --> 05:40.998
I am an attractive, intelligent, confident

05:41.040 --> 05:43.304
associate features editor.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.193
Step forward.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.460
- Here you go.
- I get my own credit card?

06:11.504 --> 06:13.495
Yeah, if you're an editor here,
you get one.

06:13.539 --> 06:18.135
It's one of the many perks of your
new position, but don't get too excited.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.441
They put a $ 100 cap on lunches.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.176
- Oh, per week?
- Per lunch, honey.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.878
Oh! And if you're here
past normal work hours,

06:25.918 --> 06:28.318
of course, you have access
to the Meade town cars.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.584
As well as the gym and steam room.

06:30.623 --> 06:34.184
And your new ID badge. Nice picture.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.187
It really is, thank you.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.839
<i>I know Mode's a fashion magazine,
and that's great.</i>

06:50.877 --> 06:55.610
I just think that we could also
be telling stories that matter, you know?

06:55.648 --> 06:57.479
Touching people's lives.

06:57.517 --> 07:00.247
Yeah, I just like
the pictures of the shoes.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.914
Yeah. No, the shoes are...
Shoes are great.

07:02.955 --> 07:06.322
I have plenty of
those kinds of ideas, too.

07:06.359 --> 07:09.351
You know, I remember
checking you in three years ago

07:09.395 --> 07:11.454
when you first started working here,
and I thought,

07:11.497 --> 07:15.627
"God, I'll be processing that girl's
exit paperwork within a month. "

07:17.170 --> 07:20.037
Congratulations. Enjoy your new office.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.253
Betty, hi. We've never technically met.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.690
I'm Megan. Not "Meh-gan"
or "Mey-gan". "Mee-gan".

07:39.725 --> 07:42.216
<i>I know. I've read everything
you've done for Mode.</i>

07:42.261 --> 07:44.229
- I think your features...
- That stuff's gonna have to go.

07:44.263 --> 07:47.790
Super cute, but it's policy.
Editor decor has to be fashion-related.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.529
Oh! Okay. Yeah. Um...

07:51.270 --> 07:52.635
Are we sharing?

07:52.672 --> 07:55.368
Because I thought she said
that this was my office.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.500
That's adorable.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.067
You thought an associate editor
would get her own office.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.272
I just want to eat you up.

08:04.350 --> 08:07.444
Well, this will be fun.
We'll be office mates.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.588
Yeah. It's more fun not to be.

08:10.623 --> 08:13.592
I had my own office,
which took four years to get.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.493
But I just had to give it to our new boss.
Think you might know him?

08:16.529 --> 08:19.430
I'm Matt Hartley,
your new managing editor.

08:20.032 --> 08:23.126
- Actually, that's my seat.
- Oh, sorry.

08:23.769 --> 08:25.703
Some of you I know.
Some of you I don't.

08:25.738 --> 08:29.230
And some of you I thought I knew,
but apparently I didn't.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.870
My role is to be a conduit between
you guys and the editors-in-chief.

08:32.912 --> 08:36.039
That means any ideas you guys have
for articles or spreads

08:36.082 --> 08:39.609
come through me because
it's all about communication, people.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.381
Some of you may have to work on that.

08:42.421 --> 08:46.152
All right, we're starting work
on our global fashion issue.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.559
Betty, why don't you start us off?
You're good with beginnings.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.654
Not so good with endings.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.199
Okay, global.

08:56.969 --> 09:01.633
Well, I've been quite interested in
the situation in sub-Saharan Africa.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.404
Malaria is devastating the continent.

09:04.443 --> 09:07.241
The awareness in the United States
is practically zero, and...

09:07.280 --> 09:08.679
Malaria?

09:08.948 --> 09:10.848
Um, yep.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.477
- Is there a fashion angle?
- Yes.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.885
I think that there would be
a very interesting side story

09:15.922 --> 09:18.015
- with African fashion...
- Betty's onto something.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.786
Malaria comes from mosquitoes.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.760
So what if we do an accessories piece
on insect jewelry?

09:22.795 --> 09:24.763
Yeah, no, that's not
what I was going to...

09:24.797 --> 09:26.287
Betty...

09:27.033 --> 09:28.864
Insect jewelry
had its heyday in the '60s,

09:28.901 --> 09:30.596
but lately, I've been
noticing a fashion trend

09:30.636 --> 09:33.696
back toward bugs and gross things,
but pretty.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.037
I like it, Megan, run with it.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.735
Who's next? Hmm?

09:44.450 --> 09:46.213
What's up, Fergie?

09:48.154 --> 09:49.314
Hi.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.384
That's a real pretty, cute shirt
you got on.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.983
Who makes it?

09:55.127 --> 09:56.560
It's Gucci.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.293
Gucci. Gucci.

10:03.703 --> 10:04.863
Oops.

10:07.974 --> 10:11.273
Oh, man. Next time, don't be so clumsy.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.548
Okay, great, I guess
everyone has their assignments.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.454
- I don't.
- I'm really excited to be here.

10:25.491 --> 10:26.822
Go team!

10:30.630 --> 10:31.790
Matt.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.593
- Matt, can we talk?
- I'm really busy.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.966
I know, which is
why I've been calling you,

10:37.003 --> 10:38.436
but you haven't answered
any of my calls.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.201
I just think there are some things
that we need to talk about if...

10:46.912 --> 10:49.039
Hi, Marc, I haven't seen you all day.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.743
Oh, I really have to take this. Hello?

10:51.784 --> 10:53.877
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.410
Really? You don't say.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.035
Amanda?

11:49.175 --> 11:52.941
Oh, Betty, hey.
I was just taking inventory.

11:52.978 --> 11:54.240
Since Christina's been gone,

11:54.280 --> 11:57.181
you never know who's going to
come down here and steal things.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.547
Not me.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.276
Oh, I'm just happy to see a friendly face.

12:02.321 --> 12:06.121
And I can finally
congratulate you on your big promotion.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.989
Oh, Amanda, thank you.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.996
The first Latina Supreme Court Justice.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.431
Tell me, Betty, how does that feel?
How do your people feel?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.594
Amanda, I'm not Judge Sotomayor.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.365
<i>But just promise me
you will not overturn Roe v. Wade.</i>

12:21.407 --> 12:24.342
- Hey, you want to grab some lunch?
- Sorry, I can't.

12:24.376 --> 12:26.207
Marc totally hates you for taking his job,

12:26.245 --> 12:28.577
and I still have to figure out
how you and I can be friends.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.047
Mandy.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.210
Get away from me, you bloated troll!

12:35.221 --> 12:36.654
Hi, Betty.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.492
I've been meaning to tell you,
cute outfit.

13:26.705 --> 13:29.367
Already enjoying the perks, I see.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.177
Oh. Oh.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.473
Hello, Wilhelmina.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.710
It's been a... A rough day.

13:40.753 --> 13:45.156
- I hope you're not expecting a pep talk.
- No, no. God, no.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.749
Good.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.795
Being an editor, it's more complicated
than I imagined.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.732
We're really going to do this?

13:54.767 --> 13:58.203
Wake up and smell
the aromatherapy, Betty.

13:58.237 --> 14:02.867
Being an assistant is boot camp.
Being an editor is war.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.807
You have your allies,
you have your enemies,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.643
often times you can't tell
which is which.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.344
It just sort of feels like I have
more enemies than allies right now.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.009
Yes, you do.

14:15.454 --> 14:18.855
Oh, and by the way, malaria? Really?

14:18.891 --> 14:21.382
Like I would ever put
disease-ridden poor people

14:21.427 --> 14:23.861
in the pages of this magazine.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.126
How did you know about that?

14:26.565 --> 14:28.260
I know everything.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.698
How does one survive?

14:35.741 --> 14:37.902
You look out for yourself.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.940
If it means screwing over
everyone else,

14:40.980 --> 14:42.413
so be it.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.848
What if you're not that kind
of a person?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.911
Well, then you change.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.348
Or you'll be eaten alive.

15:12.778 --> 15:16.145
Are you saying that muffins
are your secret weapon?

15:16.548 --> 15:17.947
Food can be very effective.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.974
The more I have
at my campaign rallies,

15:20.019 --> 15:21.452
the higher the spike in my polls.

15:21.487 --> 15:25.787
<i>Yeah, but this is Mode.
Those people don't exactly eat.</i>

15:25.824 --> 15:28.054
Which is why
I'm making nonfat, sugar-free,

15:28.093 --> 15:30.823
low-carb blueberry muffins
high in antioxidants.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.694
- Ugh!
- It's just to break the ice.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.164
You should break the ice
with something

15:34.199 --> 15:37.259
that you couldn't actually use
to break ice.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.133
<i>- Mi hija, try some butter.
- No, Dad! No butter.</i>

15:40.172 --> 15:43.164
Well, at least add
some walnuts for flavor.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.938
Fine. Look, I don't even care
if they actually eat them.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.970
I just need to get in there
and make some allies.

15:49.014 --> 15:54.179
I think you should put rat poison
in Matt's muffins and be done with it.

15:54.219 --> 15:57.655
Hilda! I'm the one who hurt him.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.982
He needs time.

16:01.026 --> 16:04.826
And I just need to be patient.

16:05.864 --> 16:08.230
Are you saying
that you want to get back with him?

16:08.267 --> 16:10.201
A few weeks ago,
they were moving in together.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.726
Those feelings don't just go away.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.439
What? He's got to forgive me
some time. Dad!

16:18.944 --> 16:20.605
- Justin!
- Hey, sweetie!

16:20.646 --> 16:22.637
Hey, nice Queensborough High
sweatshirt.

16:22.681 --> 16:25.013
Yeah! Hey, Mr. School Spirit!

16:26.285 --> 16:28.515
- Hey!
- Thanks.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.050
Wait. Where you...

16:31.890 --> 16:32.948
Justin!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.721
What happened at school?
Was it great?

16:34.760 --> 16:35.818
Hello!

16:35.861 --> 16:38.159
Come on, you're not even gonna
tell us a little something?

16:38.197 --> 16:39.221
Yeah, well, I'm kind of beat.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.425
So can we talk about it
tomorrow morning?

16:41.467 --> 16:44.095
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

16:44.536 --> 16:45.730
Okay.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.901
- All right.
- Yeah.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.938
Now, I realize that the three of us

16:52.978 --> 16:57.108
have not always been
the best of friends.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.243
Well, I suppose I shouldn't
have tried to blackmail Claire.

17:00.285 --> 17:03.482
But in my defense, it's hardly
the worst thing I've done to the woman.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.150
Though she really is
less of a woman at this point

17:06.191 --> 17:09.490
than something you use
to scare crows or children.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.387
There's something
we need to tell you, Wilhelmina.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.058
But you're not making it any easier.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.499
Enough with the dramatic windups.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.695
I know you want to fire me,
so go ahead and do it.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.204
But if you expect me
to grovel or apologize,

17:21.240 --> 17:24.505
I think you ought to know by now
you're talking to the wrong woman.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.808
Good luck finding someone else
that can do what I do.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.246
- Claire.
- We want you to stay.

17:35.587 --> 17:37.214
I'm sorry.

17:37.256 --> 17:40.487
All those facelifts must have affected
your speech. What did you say?

17:40.526 --> 17:45.589
<i>We want you to stay on
as Editor-in-Chief of Mode.</i>

17:45.631 --> 17:47.826
Reporting to me, of course.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.496
You seem surprised.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.334
Yet your eyebrows
haven't moved at all.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.641
- Well, this is unexpected.
- You were right.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.539
It was very hard to find someone
who can do what you do.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.914
Well, I'm sorry for the insults, Claire.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.152
- You know, old habits.
Of course.

18:07.186 --> 18:10.747
And for what it's worth, I had
a really good one for you about VD.

18:10.789 --> 18:14.418
- You'll have to tell me some time.
- I look forward to it.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.896
Would you like a muffin
to brighten your day?

18:25.938 --> 18:28.634
Low-fat, low sugar, high antioxidants.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.801
Low-fat, low sugar,
low-everything muffin.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.105
I'll save you one!

18:39.251 --> 18:41.310
- Hey, Marc.
- Oh, hi.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.048
Betty's waddling around here
somewhere.

18:43.088 --> 18:47.252
Last I saw, she was tossing carbs
around the office with wild abandon.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.261
Actually, I was sort of looking for you.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.057
Look,
I'll take any insect jewelry you've got.

18:54.099 --> 18:57.535
Literally, everything I've found so far
is strictly craft fair. Thanks.

18:57.569 --> 19:01.903
Hi! Brought you a muffin.
Made it myself.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.503
Oh.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.978
Yum! I'll just save it for later.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.911
Megan, I just want you to know
that if you need any help at all

19:11.950 --> 19:14.248
on your article, I'm here for you.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.084
Research, calls, anything.
Name it, I'm your girl.

19:17.122 --> 19:20.023
Oh, my God, so sweet.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.230
Matt! Matt, I made you a muffin.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.997
And I was thinking maybe
we could talk, you know, about us.

19:31.036 --> 19:32.833
Betty, not at work.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.672
Was that my nephew?

19:43.715 --> 19:47.082
Sorry, I have to take this. Hello?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.350
Hi, Marc. It's Betty.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.152
That's a muffin. You can't call
a tape dispenser with a muffin.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.058
Yes, you can.
I just did, and you answered.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.290
Bee-boo-beep!

19:58.330 --> 20:00.457
We're sorry,
your call has been disconnected.

20:00.499 --> 20:01.830
Marc, I know you hate me,

20:01.867 --> 20:05.234
but can't you just answer
one simple question? I...

20:05.604 --> 20:07.094
Walnuts.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.868
Justin was talking to Marc?
About what?

20:14.846 --> 20:18.145
I don't know
why Justin was here talking to Marc.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.318
Marc's throat closed up
before he could tell me.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.787
- Convenient.
- No. Not convenient.

20:23.822 --> 20:26.347
<i>He was allergic to the walnuts
papi put in my muffins.</i>

20:26.391 --> 20:28.951
Oh. And he didn't say anything
to you before?

20:28.994 --> 20:30.461
I thought you were gonna win him over.

20:30.495 --> 20:31.985
Well, it didn't work.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.590
No one liked my muffins,
and I don't know why Justin was here,

20:34.633 --> 20:36.692
and I'm sorry. Goodbye.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.544
I miss him, too.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.245
Hi.

20:55.654 --> 20:56.678
Hi.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.747
How are you doing, Betty?

21:00.993 --> 21:03.553
- I'm fine.
- Mmm, yes.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.531
Starting a new job,
working for your ex-boyfriend,

21:07.566 --> 21:10.763
I can see how that would leave you fine.

21:12.070 --> 21:17.702
Well, I will be fine.
I just need to find some allies.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.206
And how's that going?

21:19.244 --> 21:20.404
Um...

21:21.680 --> 21:25.047
- Put Marc in the hospital.
- That was you?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.176
Not on purpose.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.083
What about Matt?

21:31.690 --> 21:33.681
He's just been so cold.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.585
Makes me wonder if he ever really
had feelings for me to begin with.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.223
He wouldn't be here if he didn't.

21:42.934 --> 21:47.064
Trust me.
I know a thing or two about Hartleys.

21:49.608 --> 21:52.372
Well, he doesn't want to talk
to me about it,

21:52.411 --> 21:54.174
so it really doesn't make a difference.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.510
Those feelings are still there.

21:57.082 --> 22:00.108
You just have to find a way
to bring them out.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.188
- What are you doing?
- Jogging in the park.

22:11.229 --> 22:14.096
- But you're wearing heels.
- Yeah, well, I've got to get to work later.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.622
My new boss hates it when I'm late.

22:16.868 --> 22:19.666
Matt, you don't wanna talk about us
when we're at work. We're not at work.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.139
- There's nothing to talk about.
- I know you're hurt.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.506
<i>But you're the one who took the job
as my boss at Mode.</i>

22:24.543 --> 22:25.737
- So?
- So, tell me

22:25.777 --> 22:27.506
that had nothing to do with me.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.070
Look, what do you want from me?

22:29.114 --> 22:30.172
You want me to tell you I took the job

22:30.215 --> 22:33.184
because I still have feelings for you?
Because I don't.

22:42.461 --> 22:45.521
- Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?
- I don't know.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.031
- You kissed me.
- I know.

22:47.065 --> 22:48.532
Why did you kiss me?

22:48.567 --> 22:51.297
Because you said
you don't have feelings for me.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.998
- I don't.
- I don't believe you!

22:54.039 --> 22:57.270
Matt, I think you are doing this
to hurt me

22:57.309 --> 23:01.302
and all because of some stupid moment
that meant nothing!

23:01.346 --> 23:04.008
I don't know how else to apologize
for what happened with Henry.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.381
Look, I can't do this. Please.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.561
<i>What were you doing at Mode
the other day?</i>

23:19.131 --> 23:21.031
Who told you that?

23:21.066 --> 23:23.296
Ran into Naomi Campbell
on Roosevelt Boulevard.

23:23.335 --> 23:25.496
She said she saw you there.

23:26.905 --> 23:31.672
So, what were you talking
to Marc about?

23:34.780 --> 23:38.807
I spilled low-fat dressing
on my new shirt. It was ruined.

23:38.850 --> 23:41.216
I didn't want to tell you because
you spent so much money on it,

23:41.253 --> 23:42.743
so Marc got me another one.

23:42.788 --> 23:46.451
Honey, you could've told me that.

23:47.058 --> 23:50.994
Anyway, it wasn't that expensive.
It was an irregular, so...

23:51.029 --> 23:53.259
There was something wrong
with the stitching.

23:53.298 --> 23:56.233
Yeah, I saw that.
But I still liked it.

23:57.702 --> 24:01.001
You. Such a good kid.

24:08.647 --> 24:11.138
Marc!
What happened to you yesterday?

24:11.183 --> 24:15.643
I'm sorry. I had an allergic reaction,
and I had to go to the emergency room.

24:15.687 --> 24:18.918
I would have told you about it,
but my throat closed shut.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.721
Well, in the future,
do it on your own time.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.751
I need to hydrate.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.558
So, I've been too scared to ask,

24:27.599 --> 24:31.660
but how did the meeting go
with Hartley and the Hag?

24:32.704 --> 24:34.934
- They want to keep me on.
- Oh!

24:35.073 --> 24:38.065
Well, that's the best news
I've heard in days!

24:38.109 --> 24:40.134
After, "You're going to live. "

24:40.178 --> 24:43.978
Oh, please. Daniel can't run
this magazine by himself.

24:44.015 --> 24:47.007
They're just buying time till they can
lure the only other person in the world

24:47.052 --> 24:48.747
that can do what I do.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.948
<i>Isabelle Besset. French Elle.</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:54.015
I checked. They've been trading calls.

24:54.059 --> 24:56.220
That's not good news.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.729
- What are we going to do?
- Oh, I don't know.

24:59.631 --> 25:03.067
Now stop spritzing!
I don't always have a plan, you know.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.267
Hello?

25:09.541 --> 25:10.701
Marc!

25:11.142 --> 25:14.339
I don't want you
answering my cell phone anymore.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.180
It was just a call from your apartment.

25:17.215 --> 25:21.015
Yes, and I would like
my privacy respected.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.947
Starting now.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.991
She's keeping secrets from me.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.617
Who?
- Wilhelmina!

25:28.660 --> 25:30.525
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't really listening.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.291
She obviously has someone
in that apartment

25:32.330 --> 25:33.797
that she doesn't want me
to know about.

25:33.832 --> 25:36.767
Maybe it's a guy
she's having a torrid affair with.

25:36.801 --> 25:39.269
<i>And now she tells me
she's being pushed out of Mode</i>

25:39.304 --> 25:43.070
and she doesn't have a plan.
She expects me to believe that?

25:43.108 --> 25:47.101
Ooh, maybe she's running away with the
guy she's having the torrid affair with.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.476
Maybe I can join them.

25:48.513 --> 25:50.572
The only person she ever felt
that way about...

25:53.351 --> 25:57.048
Oh, my Lady Gaga.
Mandy, you're brilliant!

25:57.088 --> 25:59.181
You take that back! I'm beautiful!

26:02.561 --> 26:04.085
It's Connor.

26:06.197 --> 26:09.064
She's hiding him in her apartment.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.796
And he's already asked her
to run away with him once.

26:11.836 --> 26:15.272
And now she has no reason to stay.
What if she actually does it this time?

26:15.307 --> 26:18.435
- Lf she's out, then I'm out.
- Who?

26:19.311 --> 26:20.403
Wilhelmina!

26:20.445 --> 26:22.640
I'm sorry, I told you
I wasn't really listening.

26:22.681 --> 26:23.841
Start from the beginning.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.994
Daniel! Oh, my God!
I was just thinking about calling you!

26:41.032 --> 26:42.897
Are you back? Are you okay?

26:42.934 --> 26:46.631
Sort of. I'm having a bit of an issue
here at the airport.

26:50.942 --> 26:55.436
So, you may be on
some terrorist watch list for now,

26:55.480 --> 26:57.209
but they're not going to press charges.

26:57.248 --> 27:00.979
Press charges. I should press charges.
Betty, they lost my wife.

27:01.019 --> 27:04.216
Daniel, weren't you going to spread
her ashes at the Jokhang Temple?

27:04.255 --> 27:07.122
I did. But I decided
to keep some of the ashes.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.456
But then they made me check the urn
and they lost her.

27:09.494 --> 27:11.428
They lost half my wife.

27:12.097 --> 27:15.760
But they found her.
You have the urn, it's okay.

27:17.335 --> 27:20.736
Daniel, I know you want to stay
at Molly's apartment,

27:21.573 --> 27:23.040
but is that really the best idea?

27:23.074 --> 27:24.666
Look, it's fine.

27:24.709 --> 27:28.509
My apartment's on the market,
I need a place to stay.

27:28.546 --> 27:30.741
Besides, I have to
go through her things anyway.

27:30.782 --> 27:34.183
- All right, if you think it's okay.
- Enough about me.

27:34.219 --> 27:37.814
I want to hear about how things have
been going. How's life as an editor?

27:37.856 --> 27:40.518
Great! Really great. Good. It's good.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.093
You are a bad liar.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.753
I know.

27:44.996 --> 27:47.430
But I'm not going to complain
about my problems to you.

27:47.465 --> 27:51.799
Betty, trust me. It's a relief to hear
about somebody else's problems.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.906
So he barely speaks to me. Thank you.

28:34.946 --> 28:37.915
And then my pitch gets turned into
something completely different,

28:37.949 --> 28:39.507
which he decides to give to Megan.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.951
Wait, I can't believe that
spoiled little bastard gave it to Megan!

28:41.986 --> 28:43.715
Did you talk to Wilhelmina? My mom?

28:43.755 --> 28:47.714
No, no, I don't have to do that.
And it's not just Matt, Daniel.

28:47.759 --> 28:51.251
- It's like everybody hates me.
- Oh, you can turn that around.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.264
<i>Or maybe it's going to be like
your first year at Mode.</i>

28:53.298 --> 28:55.823
Remember how everyone used to
make fun of you?

28:55.867 --> 28:58.961
- Even started that blog about you.
- What blog?

29:00.138 --> 29:02.766
You know, the one about your outfits.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.504
The one where they took pictures
of you every day?

29:05.543 --> 29:07.977
You have to know about this.

29:08.012 --> 29:09.309
Oh, boy.

29:11.015 --> 29:15.952
<i>Oh, my God! They've been
doing this since my first day at Mode?</i>

29:16.454 --> 29:18.217
And nobody told me?

29:18.256 --> 29:20.986
Betty, I just kind of thought you knew.

29:21.526 --> 29:23.357
Well, I love that outfit.

29:23.394 --> 29:25.487
Yeah, I love that one, too.

29:25.530 --> 29:28.522
Uh, okay,
maybe that one was a mistake.

29:28.566 --> 29:30.261
You know what? Don't worry about it.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.565
You survived that,
you're going to survive this.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.937
- How?
- Well, doing what you always do.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.275
Focus on your work,
show them you're a team player.

29:39.310 --> 29:42.939
I am. I tried to help Megan find a take
on her insect jewelry piece.

29:42.981 --> 29:45.575
She didn't like any of my ideas.
I love that belt.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.278
Insect jewelry?

29:48.119 --> 29:51.282
So, Molly found this
in some antique shop a while back.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.722
Turns out it's worth a lot of money.

29:54.859 --> 29:57.384
- "Olivia"?
- Yeah, it's Olivia Guillemette.

29:57.428 --> 30:00.363
She was big in the '60s.
Kind of a recluse now.

30:00.398 --> 30:03.890
I bet a resourceful writerleditor
could track her down.

30:05.069 --> 30:08.835
Thank you, Daniel.
I'm really glad you're back.

30:08.873 --> 30:12.070
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too, Betty.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.947
Did you really have to
bookmark that blog?

30:25.824 --> 30:28.520
Oh, that's so cool.
I can't believe it.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.826
Well, the doctors overseas
are always better.

30:33.865 --> 30:37.164
Willie! How come you didn't tell me
that your daughter was back in town?

30:37.202 --> 30:39.397
How much do we love
Nico's new nose?

30:39.437 --> 30:41.496
Honestly, it took my breath away!

30:54.586 --> 30:56.144
Are you Olivia?

30:58.590 --> 31:01.855
You're just in time.
Come in quickly or you'll miss it.

31:01.926 --> 31:04.520
- Um, oh...
- Hurry up, quick. Come on.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.865
Willie, I have to ask you a question.
Are you mad at me?

31:13.905 --> 31:15.133
No more than usual.

31:15.173 --> 31:19.872
Oh, I just don't understand why you felt
you had to hide Nico from me.

31:19.911 --> 31:22.072
I need to know that you still trust me.

31:22.113 --> 31:24.343
Don't we have an agreement
not to discuss your needs?

31:24.382 --> 31:26.407
Yes, of course. It's just...

31:27.185 --> 31:29.949
You would not believe
some of the scenarios I came up with

31:29.988 --> 31:32.183
about who you were hiding here.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.124
At one point,
I even thought it was Connor.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.793
Well, there is something
that I haven't told you.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.530
And it's not about Nico.
It's about Connor.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.401
- I knew it!
- I knew you knew it.

31:46.437 --> 31:48.667
I hired a bounty hunter
to track him down

31:48.706 --> 31:51.436
so I could take back the money
he stole from Meade

31:51.509 --> 31:54.069
in order to use it to buy out Hartley.

31:54.112 --> 31:55.204
Oh!

31:57.015 --> 31:59.575
But Hartley's got his snout
all up in Claire's Spanx.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.211
He's not going to sell
his shares of Meade to you.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.586
Well, he won't know it's me.
I'll use an intermediary.

32:05.623 --> 32:09.787
Oh, Marc, you think this is
my first extortionlsecret takeover?

32:09.827 --> 32:11.954
- Please, seriously.
- Right, of course.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.457
So, I'm sorry I left you out of it.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.833
But sometimes I feel I need
to protect you from these things.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.304
Oh, well, thank you.

32:22.607 --> 32:27.044
- But no more secrets, right?
- No more secrets. Promise.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.204
Okay.

32:32.517 --> 32:36.681
Well, now that Marc knows you're back,
people are going to start to find out.

32:36.721 --> 32:39.519
We have to act
like everything is normal.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.785
You understand?

32:44.996 --> 32:46.429
Sweetheart?

32:47.365 --> 32:48.798
I'm scared.

32:56.874 --> 32:58.933
What are you doing here?

33:02.947 --> 33:05.040
I think I'm in trouble.

33:09.287 --> 33:12.450
Don't worry.
I will take care of everything.

33:19.630 --> 33:23.293
I've never seen a butterfly
come out of its cocoon before.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.201
Everyone talks
about the miracle of birth.

33:26.938 --> 33:30.135
I think rebirth is even more of a miracle.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.839
- Oh, it looks like he's struggling.
- Oh, he can handle it.

33:34.879 --> 33:38.246
I suspect that caterpillars
stay in their cocoons

33:38.282 --> 33:41.274
a little longer than they really need to.

33:41.319 --> 33:45.255
It's got to be scary
to change into a whole new thing.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.748
Wow.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.385
- He's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

33:52.964 --> 33:59.062
- Oh. But the caterpillar's just gone.
- No, he's still in there.

34:00.304 --> 34:05.264
Other people see the wings and colors.

34:05.309 --> 34:07.402
I'll always see the caterpillar.

34:07.445 --> 34:11.141
Thank you so much for letting me
see that. That was amazing.

34:11.181 --> 34:15.516
Mmm. I think so, too.
That's why I invited everybody to watch.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.350
- Everybody?
- Mmm-hmm.

34:23.928 --> 34:25.259
Oh.

34:25.295 --> 34:31.701
Unfortunately, I've now got to get
everybody back into their house.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.567
I'll need some help.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.706
So, anyway, the reason I came

34:37.742 --> 34:41.178
<i>was to talk to you about a feature
that Mode magazine...</i>

34:41.212 --> 34:43.442
Careful, you don't want to
tip over the tarantulas.

34:43.481 --> 34:46.348
Oh! You are correct.

34:48.351 --> 34:52.812
I thought that we could focus a feature
on your insect jewelry.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.550
It's on your shoulder.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.085
- A tarantula?
- A butterfly.

34:59.464 --> 35:01.989
Hold very still.

35:06.270 --> 35:10.172
I think they're attracted
by the color of your clothes.

35:10.208 --> 35:14.269
Really? This is kind of tame for me.

35:14.312 --> 35:15.404
Hmm.

35:15.446 --> 35:20.748
All right. Very still. Go now.

35:21.519 --> 35:26.354
You follow me
back to the butterfly house.

35:41.072 --> 35:43.370
Careful. There you go.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.345
Now shake.

35:59.957 --> 36:01.390
We did it!

36:06.230 --> 36:08.289
- Wow.
- They like you.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.358
Now, what did you want to talk about?

36:14.672 --> 36:16.799
These are for you.

36:17.775 --> 36:19.470
And here you go.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.342
Oh, my God. Olivia?
I thought she was dead.

36:25.383 --> 36:27.112
Nope. She's alive.

36:27.151 --> 36:29.016
And a very fascinating woman

36:29.053 --> 36:32.318
who would make a wonderful subject
for your feature.

36:32.356 --> 36:35.450
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

36:35.493 --> 36:39.361
- Are you trying to steal my story?
- No, I was trying to help.

36:40.498 --> 36:42.398
Take it or leave it.

36:45.269 --> 36:46.497
Shoot.

36:50.675 --> 36:51.835
Here.

36:55.413 --> 36:56.812
Thank you.

37:05.756 --> 37:07.053
Betty...

37:12.063 --> 37:14.896
Those muffins you made
were really good.

37:26.143 --> 37:28.543
Hello! Hi, there you are.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.946
Ah! Betty's younger sister.

37:31.983 --> 37:35.214
Well, thank you for the part of that
that complimented me.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.313
But watch it for the part
that slammed my sister. Yeah?

37:38.356 --> 37:40.790
Listen, I came here to thank you

37:40.825 --> 37:43.191
for helping Justin out
with the shirt yesterday.

37:43.227 --> 37:45.195
Yeah, but I want to pay you for it,
all right?

37:45.229 --> 37:46.958
Okay. It was $400.

37:47.898 --> 37:50.196
- What?
- It was free.

37:50.234 --> 37:52.293
I called the design house,
told them it was a Jonas,

37:52.336 --> 37:54.497
they sent one right over.
Keep your money.

37:54.538 --> 37:55.971
Oh!

37:56.007 --> 38:00.376
That's good because, you know, this
check would have bounced so hard.

38:01.112 --> 38:05.105
Anyway, thank you so much
for helping Justin out.

38:05.149 --> 38:08.812
Oh, yeah, well, it's hard for a kid
when he gets pushed around like that.

38:08.853 --> 38:10.047
Yeah.

38:10.554 --> 38:13.580
- Wait, what did you say?
- Wait, what did you say?

38:13.624 --> 38:16.957
- Someone's pushing my son around?
- No. No.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.987
Okay, obviously he didn't want you
to know about it,

38:21.032 --> 38:22.522
so you have to pretend
like I didn't tell you.

38:22.566 --> 38:24.761
I'm not pretending anything.

38:24.802 --> 38:28.238
If someone is pushing my son around,
I need to know.

38:28.939 --> 38:33.171
- Why... Why did he lie to me?
- Well, because you're his mother.

38:33.210 --> 38:36.304
And, I speak from experience,
it is really hard for a boy

38:36.347 --> 38:38.440
to admit something like that
to his mother.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.177
No. Not Justin.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.617
- We are like this.
- Clearly.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.417
Look, the next time he comes to you
with something like this,

38:45.456 --> 38:48.357
I would appreciate it
if you send him right home to me.

38:48.392 --> 38:50.485
- But...
- I'm not asking.

38:50.528 --> 38:52.428
Okay. But...

39:05.943 --> 39:07.774
Thanks for inviting me
to have lunch with you.

39:07.812 --> 39:09.712
It feels so good
to have someone to talk to.

39:09.747 --> 39:12.807
Trust me, I feel the same way.
It's been a rough week.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.317
Remember last year
when everyone was like,

39:14.352 --> 39:17.185
"Change, yay, Obama, change"?

39:17.221 --> 39:19.746
This year, change sucks.

39:19.790 --> 39:23.521
Justin, I am so sorry
that high school's been rough.

39:23.561 --> 39:26.029
Trust me, I know exactly
what that feels like.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.655
I wish I could do something to help.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.063
Are you kidding?
You're already doing it.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.499
I saw Heidi Klum on the way in.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.660
Actually, that was Monica...

39:31.702 --> 39:34.432
Don't ruin my moment,
it was Heidi Klum.

39:34.472 --> 39:36.997
Heidi looks amazing. Can you believe
she's had three children?

39:37.041 --> 39:38.303
I know!

39:39.043 --> 39:42.945
Hey. Some of us are eating over there.
Come join if you want.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.907
- Is that Megan?
- Megan. Yeah.

39:47.952 --> 39:50.318
But I'm having lunch with you.

39:50.354 --> 39:53.812
Are you kidding? You're so stupid!
Why would you not go eat with them?

39:53.858 --> 39:56.418
They're the popular table.
And you won't get a second invite.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.451
Justin, I am not abandoning you.

39:58.496 --> 40:01.294
Well, then I'm abandoning you. Bye.

40:11.542 --> 40:12.770
Oh!

40:12.843 --> 40:15.175
Hey, Marc. What are you up to?

40:19.650 --> 40:23.848
Is she still here? Is this a test?

40:24.822 --> 40:25.880
What are you talking about?

40:25.923 --> 40:29.984
I just wanted to see if you wanted
to go grab lunch or something.

40:30.027 --> 40:35.226
Well, first of all, I had fries last night,
so there'll be no lunch today.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.032
<i>And second, tu mamá just scared
the Jesús out of me.</i>

40:39.770 --> 40:42.432
My mother?
What are you talking about?

40:42.473 --> 40:43.735
She was just here.

40:43.774 --> 40:47.505
And she was very clear
about me not talking to you,

40:47.545 --> 40:49.103
so I'm sorry.

40:51.048 --> 40:53.107
You probably
shouldn't come around anymore.

40:57.588 --> 41:00.148
When you first showed up,
I didn't think I was going to like you.

41:00.224 --> 41:01.589
Yeah, I could kind of tell.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.456
I just thought you'd gotten the job
as a courtesy

41:03.494 --> 41:06.520
because you were Daniel's assistant,
not because you were talented.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.555
Oh! Wow. Okay.

41:08.599 --> 41:12.194
Look, I take the title "editor"
pretty seriously.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.704
- But I can see you do, too.
- Thanks, Megan.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.229
Hey, skinny bitches! And Betty.

41:17.274 --> 41:19.640
Emergency meeting in
the conference room. Fire in the hole!

41:19.677 --> 41:22.703
Chippity-chop-chop-chop!
All departments!

41:22.746 --> 41:24.577
Wait, Amanda, what?

41:25.182 --> 41:26.706
Daniel's back.

41:32.556 --> 41:34.023
Hello, everybody.

41:34.058 --> 41:36.253
Thank you so much
for cutting your lunches short.

41:36.293 --> 41:39.626
I appreciate all the hard work you've
been doing while I've been gone,

41:39.663 --> 41:40.789
but I'm back now.

41:40.831 --> 41:44.562
And unfortunately, there are some
things going on that I just don't like.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.503
First of all,
the feature piece on insect jewelry.

41:47.538 --> 41:50.063
It was a pitch started from Betty,

41:50.107 --> 41:53.235
it was taken away from her
and given to Megan.

I know you're new here, Matt,
but that's not the way we do things.

41:57.214 --> 42:00.149
So, effective immediately,
the story goes back to Betty.

42:00.184 --> 42:03.210
Sorry, Megan, you're going to have to
come up with some ideas of your own.

42:03.254 --> 42:07.122
And Matt, it's probably a good idea
if you did a little legwork,

42:07.157 --> 42:10.888
figured out the dos and don'ts
of being a managing editor.

42:12.329 --> 42:14.490
Look forward to
reading your piece, Betty.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.898
I'm sure it's going to be great.
