WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:11.261
-Hey, Devin and Devon are having

00:11.344 --> 00:12.762
a New Year's Eve party tonight.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.556
Oh! New Year's.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.766
When the ball drops,
you better find someone

00:16.850 --> 00:20.311
to kiss your balls
as they drop into their mouth.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.565
Hey-yo! The producers are finally
letting me write my own jokes.

00:23.648 --> 00:27.694
Cool. "Please join us
for a Re-New Year's Eve party

00:27.777 --> 00:30.363
as we renew our vows for the year ahead.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.573
Black-tie enforced"?

00:31.656 --> 00:33.908
Do you think that little shit
Nick is gonna be there?

00:33.992 --> 00:38.705
Because if he is, that party is gonna
turn into a fucking funeral, brother.

00:38.788 --> 00:42.417
I was this close to touching
a real-life boob, and Nick ruined it!

00:42.500 --> 00:45.712
You should go to the bastard's house
and give him a piece of your mind.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.589
Oh, you're right. I should!

00:47.672 --> 00:51.217
I'm gonna go let him have it,
Marty Glouberman style.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.970
Yes! Ask for a refund on your friendship.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.889
No one fucks with Andrew, baby!

00:55.972 --> 01:00.226
You're a man, Andrew,
with a dick of steel and a gun for an ass.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.186
Go get 'em!

01:01.269 --> 01:03.104
-I don't wanna show up

01:03.188 --> 01:05.732
at a shitty New Year's Eve party
with a dumb broken leg.

01:05.815 --> 01:10.737
Not to mention your cast
smells like a pile of hot Band-Aids.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.238
This is all your fault, Walter.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.907
My fault?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.784
You broke your own damn leg,

01:15.867 --> 01:16.951
you pocket diva.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.829
No, no, no, no, no.
You made me fall in love with Jessi.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.291
Then you made me hate everybody
and go down that stupid fucking mountain.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.543
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:25.627 --> 01:27.003
I did all of that?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.255
Yeah, you're the reason my life sucks.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.924
You know what? Fuck this.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.969
I am D-O-N-E done with your sniveling ass.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.304
Toodle-oo, bitch!

01:36.387 --> 01:37.847
Hey, where do you think you're going?

01:37.931 --> 01:40.100
Don't you dare leave
while I'm fucking talking.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.477
-Get off me, you weak-ass gimp!

01:42.560 --> 01:45.563
Dr. Birch,
I need to talk to your miserable son.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.817
And I need to talk to whoever cuts
your hair because you look dynamite,

01:48.900 --> 01:49.734
and I love you.

01:51.903 --> 01:55.198
Don't you ever
grab a grown worm's tail!

01:55.281 --> 01:58.451
-Nicholas Birch-- Whoa! Jesus!

01:58.535 --> 01:59.994
What the hell is that thing?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.872
Oh, shit. I'm sure they'll be right out.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.375
-Do not go in there

02:05.458 --> 02:08.545
unless you want to see
doo-doo in the sink!

02:41.536 --> 02:43.788
Maury, what the fuck was that snake thing?

02:43.872 --> 02:45.290
Not a snake, a hate worm.

02:45.373 --> 02:50.587
They're creatures that infect your soul
with a lust for animus and violence.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.880
So, like, bad vibes?

02:51.963 --> 02:52.797
Yeah, bad vibes.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.049
But now Nick is outta your life.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.094
He's Criminal Minds, baby. He's canceled.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.388
He's off the air, and we don't care.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.473
But, Maury, we gotta get Nick back!

03:02.557 --> 03:05.894
You can't lose eight kids
and not expect a pay cut, man!

03:05.977 --> 03:07.562
I'm trying to buy a trampoline over here!

03:07.645 --> 03:10.857
Why should we help Nick?
Did you not hear about my titty tragedy?

03:10.940 --> 03:12.609
Pretty please, Maury?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.235
With a booger on top?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.863
Ugh, fine. I'll help.
But only for you, Rick.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.365
You know,
Rick once helped me out of a Costco.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.992
You can't find the exit in those places.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.952
You just gotta look for the entrance.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.913
The entrance is the exit, man!

03:24.996 --> 03:25.872
Voilà, baby!

03:25.955 --> 03:29.751
All right, I'll come, but only because
I, too, have been lost in a Costco,

03:29.834 --> 03:30.919
and it is scary.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.086
Road trip!

03:32.170 --> 03:33.504
-Ah!
-Pack your bags, baby!

03:33.588 --> 03:36.633
The girls are headed to sunny San Diego!

03:36.716 --> 03:37.884
Whoo-hoo!

03:37.967 --> 03:40.094
-Ooh, a New Year's Eve party!

03:40.178 --> 03:43.097
Missy, let's get out
of this dirty fart room

03:43.181 --> 03:45.058
and see some actual human beings.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.018
Fuck that!
You don't want to see those lowlifes.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.062
-Who the fudge is that?

03:49.145 --> 03:52.440
Don't make me go in there, Monica.
She's a hate bomb.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.108
But it's your turn, Cyrus.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.988
-Okay, you can do this.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.907
She's just a 13-year-old girl.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.826
If you're here to calm me down,
fat man, it's not gonna happen!

04:03.910 --> 04:05.411
Hey now, honey.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.288
I, uh, just wanted to tell you

04:07.372 --> 04:09.624
-I know how you feel.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.793
-Let me get this straight, Dad.

04:11.876 --> 04:17.006
You think a 50-year-old, bald nerd
who wears a radish bra knows how I feel?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.717
Well, now,
I--I don't wear the bra.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.053
Ooh! Drop some salt on this old bitch.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.265
-You want to know how I feel, Cyrus Byrus?

04:25.348 --> 04:28.351
-Well, I hate you and I hate your wife!
-You mean your mother?

04:28.434 --> 04:31.688
And I hate Jessi, I hate Ali, Nick,

04:31.771 --> 04:34.190
my messed-up hair, my gross bacne,

04:34.274 --> 04:36.150
and I hate carob too!

04:36.234 --> 04:39.362
It doesn't taste like chocolate,
it tastes like crap!

04:39.445 --> 04:41.197
Oh, Missy! Not carob!

04:41.281 --> 04:44.075
-Fuck carob and fuck you too!

04:44.158 --> 04:44.993
Oh, shit!

04:45.868 --> 04:46.953
How'd it go?

04:47.036 --> 04:49.497
Let's just say,
"I wear the bra."

04:49.580 --> 04:50.915
-You do?
-No!

04:50.999 --> 04:52.166
Mmm.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.045
Ah, Jay's pants car is a Wonderland.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.466
I just found this sexy pair
of Emeril Lagasse bootcut jeans from 2002.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.594
I am having a weirdly amazing time.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.556
Me too, and look!
A pair of pants with a butt zipper.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.267
They're perfect for
getting your ass eaten on the go.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.393
-Ugh.
-Hey, Matthew,

05:10.476 --> 05:13.896
what has 50 teeth
and a big brown eye in the middle?

05:13.980 --> 05:17.066
Huh? What's that?
I can't write my own jokes anymore?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.319
Okay, well, I guess you don't want
the show to be funny.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.903
Hey, Matthew. I was thinking,

05:20.987 --> 05:23.990
maybe we can go
to the Devins' New Year's party,

05:24.073 --> 05:25.908
dot, dot, dot, together?

05:25.992 --> 05:26.826
-Yes, yes!
-Yes.

05:26.909 --> 05:27.785
-Yes?
-Yes!

05:27.869 --> 05:28.745
Yes!

05:30.288 --> 05:32.749
New Year's wolf!

05:32.832 --> 05:34.709
Come on, Matthew, howl with me.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.712
-Well, I don't know if howling's my thing…
-Oh.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.548
…'cause I'm more of a swan, bitch.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.719
Oh!

05:44.802 --> 05:49.640
You know what would really make
your dirty swan ass shit out an egg?

05:50.641 --> 05:53.895
If we took this naughty girl for a spin.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.521
Wait, what? This car turns on?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.149
Duh! It's only got 600,000 miles on it.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.611
Come on, how about a little joyride?

06:01.694 --> 06:04.322
Oh, shit! This kid is a madman.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.575
-What the fuck are you wearing?
-It's a denim gimp suit, after all.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.078
-Matthew, I absolutely love it.
-Ha ha!

06:10.161 --> 06:12.163
-Here we go!
-Jay, no. It's icy out.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.291
This is an old car. You're a child.
You can't be on the road.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.878
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads,

06:18.961 --> 06:21.839
'cause I drive on the sidewalk, baby.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.844
-You better back the fuck up!

06:26.928 --> 06:28.262
-Ah! Wait. Wait.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.807
Where are you going?
You can't just leave me here.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.601
Bitch, I just did.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.852
Shit!

06:34.936 --> 06:37.480
Excuse me, sir, I need a little help.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.065
-Hey, octopus lady--
-Uh, no.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.360
-You, walking clump of noodles--
-Sorry, I don't have any change.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.654
Jesus, everyone up here's an asshole too.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.407
Wah wah, take it
to the Complaints Department, kid.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.326
The Complaints Department?
Perfect. Where--where is that?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.788
Follow me. I'm gonna complain
about how my dick pops out of my head

06:53.871 --> 06:55.456
every time I get pissed off.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.916
Look at this thing.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.419
I just don't get why Missy is so angry.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.630
She had an idea, I had an idea.
People just liked mine more.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.925
People. Like. Your. Shit!
You can't help it.

07:06.008 --> 07:09.303
That's called charisma.
Seahorse Ronan got the same problem.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.806
-I think her name is Saoirse.
-No, that's not a name.

07:11.889 --> 07:16.060
Jessi, didn't Missy try talking to you
about how you took over her affinity group

07:16.144 --> 07:17.770
and you kind of blew her off?

07:17.854 --> 07:20.648
I mean, I remember her
coming up to me at school,

07:20.731 --> 07:23.067
but I don't really remember
anything she said.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.028
Now, see, if Seahorse was saying it,
you'd remember that shit.

07:26.112 --> 07:31.033
Well, there's this bummer guy
at the office and he sort of sucks a lot,

07:31.117 --> 07:33.619
but I think he might be able to help you.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.788
-Ha ha! That's right, Sonya,

07:35.872 --> 07:39.584
because sometimes
shame is so very appropriate.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.295
Oh, God, not him. He's awful.

07:42.378 --> 07:45.465
I was just gonna say
the same thing about you.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.468
Whoa, what's happening? Is that me?

07:48.551 --> 07:53.890
Yes, you're experiencing this moment
with Missy through her eyes.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.100
Jessi,
you took over my affinity group,

07:56.184 --> 07:59.353
and I'm not saying that you need
to smooch my booty, but you know what?

07:59.437 --> 08:00.480
You should apologize!

08:00.563 --> 08:04.817
Fine. I am sorry, I guess,
for helping you get rid of the mascot,

08:04.901 --> 08:06.694
-which is exactly what you wanted.
-Ooph!

08:06.777 --> 08:08.779
Damn. This didn't seem
bitchy to you at the time?

08:08.863 --> 08:09.822
That's not…

08:09.906 --> 08:12.533
I don't think you should come
to the affinity group meetings anymore.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.077
Oh, no, I can't come
to your boring meetings?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.579
That's such a bummer.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.663
Aw…

08:17.747 --> 08:19.874
Oh, God, I said all that?

08:19.957 --> 08:22.168
-Oh, I'm so ashamed.
-Nailed it!

08:22.251 --> 08:24.670
I just rolled right over her
without realizing it.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.671
Who acts like that?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.757
Most of the time it is the white people.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.052
Also, back then,
you were so into Ali,

08:31.135 --> 08:33.554
you didn't give a hot shit
about anyone else,

08:33.638 --> 08:35.056
and that's kind of my fault.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.724
No, no, that's on me.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.392
Ladies, please.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.020
It's all your faults.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.443
So you'd like to lodge a complaint
against your daughter.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.571
-She says I wear a radish bra.
-Well, do you wear the bra?

08:50.655 --> 08:53.950
-No, I don't wear a bra!
-Okay, sir, no need to holler. Hooph!

08:54.033 --> 08:56.369
Between you and me,
I think he wears the bra.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.204
-What?
-How can I help you, cutie pie?

08:58.287 --> 09:00.748
One of your goddamn hate worms
left me here to die.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.585
Oh, dearie, well,
that isn't super-duper, is it?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.254
-Name?
-Nick Birch.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.257
Oh, boy. You have quite the file here.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.802
Yeah, because I've been fucked over
by every monster you've ever given me.

09:12.885 --> 09:17.181
Walter, Rick, Tyler,
the Shame Wizard, Tito, Connie!

09:17.265 --> 09:19.100
This whole operation is a shit show.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.019
Gosh, I don't care for the cusses,
Mr. Denis Leary.

09:22.103 --> 09:26.190
I don't give a rat's ass, I want answers.
I want to speak to whoever is in charge.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.026
Oh, well, that's actually a great idea.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.111
Good. Finally.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.696
A-a little respect. Thank you.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.907
-End of the hall, red elevator, top floor.

09:34.991 --> 09:35.908
Well, go on now.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.286
It's just the one
with the throbbing red door.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.203
Uh…

09:39.287 --> 09:42.957
Oh, it's okay, sweetheart,
you're just getting what you asked for.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.795
Okay, well, Nick was
with a hate worm named Walter,

09:47.878 --> 09:49.255
and this is the Hate Division.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.757
This place gives me the creeps, Maury!

09:51.841 --> 09:53.009
What if get too scared

09:53.092 --> 09:54.594
-and I doo-doo in a sink?
-Ahh!

09:55.219 --> 09:57.471
-Oh, my God.
-Holy shit!

09:57.555 --> 09:58.848
Andrew Glouberman?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.683
-Guys, come here, it's him.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.603
You're that hateful maniac that yanked
that kid out of his wheelchair.

10:03.686 --> 10:04.687
Fuck, I love you!

10:04.770 --> 10:07.356
Oh, remember when
he went to the Nazi meeting?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.610
You're such a dick!
Hey, do you think I could get a selfie?

10:10.693 --> 10:13.446
Maury, I-I'm uncomfortable
with my new celebrity.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.032
Well, you did do all those things.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.826
-Ooh! Do something terrible right now.
-Excuse me?

10:18.909 --> 10:21.621
Stab me! Stab me in the ear.
It would be an honor.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.205
Yeah, come on, asshole. Do it.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.750
Stab him in the neck, not the ear.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.127
What is this, a fucking Claire's?

10:28.210 --> 10:30.504
Walter, we were just looking for you.
Where's Nick?

10:30.588 --> 10:31.672
No clue, Maurice.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.634
I left that little dribble of piss
to rot and die.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.010
Completely understandable.

10:36.093 --> 10:39.263
And what exactly are you doing here?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.431
Uh, looking for Nick.

10:40.514 --> 10:45.144
You know he thinks
you're a hemorrhoid with glasses, right?

10:45.227 --> 10:46.646
Those were his exact words?

10:46.729 --> 10:49.899
Doesn't that make you
just hate his little guts?

10:49.982 --> 10:53.653
-I mean…
-You need a hate worm, and I'm tech avail.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.238
Well, you have done
incredible work with Nick.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.783
Oh, honey. I'm the best.

10:58.866 --> 11:02.703
But no, no, I can't. I know what it's like
to go to those dark and angry places.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.206
And I don't hate Nick. I want to help him.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.123
-Boo!

11:06.207 --> 11:08.167
-What a crock!
-Never meet your heroes.

11:08.250 --> 11:12.254
Come on, Maury, we gotta keep looking
for that mean little asshole.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.590
-Ugh, fine. Wait, where's Rick?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.051
Go! Go! Go! I did it!
I doo-doo'd the sink!

11:17.134 --> 11:18.761
What? Why do you keep flushing, then?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.722
I like the sound, man!
Just go! Run! Run! Run! Run!

11:22.223 --> 11:25.976
Oh, Knights of St. Joseph,
I'm in utter shambles,

11:26.060 --> 11:29.814
for my relationship with Jay
seems, like, totally done-zo!

11:29.897 --> 11:31.190
Please, your grace,

11:31.273 --> 11:34.026
I beg of thee not to roost in such sorrow.

11:34.110 --> 11:38.489
But I hurt him so badly,
and it was absolutely on purpose.

11:38.572 --> 11:42.535
Just as I asked my hamster Eli
after his untimely death,

11:42.618 --> 11:46.330
"Why do we microwave
the ones we love the most?"

11:46.414 --> 11:48.624
-You know, 'tis only a matter of time

11:48.708 --> 11:51.627
before we see
the inside of that microwave.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.421
Shall we tell her of the prophecy?

11:53.504 --> 11:54.714
Prophecy?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.090
Of what prophecy…

11:56.173 --> 11:57.174
…do you talk of?

11:57.258 --> 12:01.721
Your Highness, we speak of a prophecy
delivered unto thee years ago

12:01.804 --> 12:04.223
about your romantic destiny.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.599
Listening.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.226
Who's that?

12:07.309 --> 12:10.521
-Ah, 'tis thee as a babe, Your Majesty.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.982
Like, honestly, goo-goo.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.819
Tiny princess, thou are fated
to find a love pure of heart.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.655
Neither father nor mother shall he have.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.450
And, uh, a crown shalt rest upon his head.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.576
Oh, my goo-goo.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.537
Oh, my God, this is stunning news.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.331
That prophecy totally refers to Jay.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.626
He's my true love!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.629
Well, it may refer to many suitors,
My Queen.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.797
No, it's totally him!

12:36.881 --> 12:41.093
Jay is basically an orphan,
and the crown is his spiky hair!

12:41.177 --> 12:43.888
-Case closed!
-I worry that you're reaching, My Lady.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.891
Yeah, reaching for the microwave
if you don't shut up.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.018
-Oh yeah, case closed.
-Yeah, no, I think it's Jay.

12:49.101 --> 12:53.647
Get ready, Jay,
this queen is coming for her fucking king!

12:53.731 --> 12:56.108
What the barf is that?

12:56.192 --> 12:58.486
I know you don't want to talk to me,

12:58.569 --> 13:00.946
but there's someone else
who might know how you feel.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.031
Hey, girl!

13:02.114 --> 13:03.824
We are not her girl. Hang up!

13:03.908 --> 13:07.286
No! I want to see her face
when I rip her a new dookie chute.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.997
Why'd you call, Quinta?
To fart down my throat?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.500
Okay, no, I've actually been feeling bad

13:12.583 --> 13:14.502
about how things
went down on Thanksgiving.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.503
-What?
-Fuck that.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.798
And Uncle Cyrus said you've been
holed up in your room all break,

13:18.881 --> 13:20.341
pissing in jars and shit.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.092
You don't look too good. You okay?

13:22.176 --> 13:23.427
What do you care how I look?

13:23.511 --> 13:25.596
You said my braids
look like Frederick Douglass.

13:25.679 --> 13:26.806
I'm sorry.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.391
As funny as that was,
you didn't deserve it.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.977
-Yeah, I didn't.
-Come on, let me help you with your hair.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.229
Yes, please!

13:33.312 --> 13:34.313
Bump that noise.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.941
This piece of shit can't help you.
She's a piece of shit.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.944
-Ah!
-She's not a piece of shit! She's Quinta!

13:40.027 --> 13:42.238
She's my favorite one in the whole family.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.282
-She knows cool music and calls men hoes!

13:45.366 --> 13:46.909
Yeah, she's my cousin…

13:46.992 --> 13:48.285
…and I love her!

13:48.369 --> 13:49.954
No, no, no, Missy, hang up.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.789
Quinta! I want your help!

13:51.872 --> 13:53.874
Okay, why are you yelling, girl?

13:53.958 --> 13:54.792
Chill out.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.044
-Oh, what the hell?

13:57.127 --> 14:00.548
Kroll Show? Oh, Hello on Broadway?

14:00.631 --> 14:01.966
Huh, Big Mouth.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.217
Hello?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.179
-Hey! Yeah, come in.
-Whoa!

14:07.263 --> 14:08.472
Yeah, yeah, come on in.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.600
Look at you! Little me. You look great.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.310
What the fuck?

14:13.394 --> 14:16.897
Who are you,
and why do you look, like, so weird?

14:16.981 --> 14:19.108
I'm, uh, Nick Kroll, creator of Big Mouth,

14:19.191 --> 14:21.861
and I guess, like,
grown-up, real-life you.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.279
That's very strange.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.488
Oh, yeah, I know.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.367
It's a very big swing.
We'll see if it works, but not right now.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.327
Right now,
we're gonna cut to the next scene.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.495
"Next scene"? What?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.330
"Jay's Pants Car."

14:33.414 --> 14:35.791
Jay has a pants car? That sounds fun!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.794
-Holy shit, Maury. This is insane.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.755
I know. And why does Jay have
a "Baby on board" sign?

14:41.839 --> 14:43.507
Is there a baby under the pants?

14:43.591 --> 14:47.511
-Driving wolf!
-Whoa, Jay, what the hell are you doing?

14:47.595 --> 14:51.348
What? I like to speed and throw pants
out the window at strangers.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.395
I have proof who the Ponytail Killer is.
It's--

14:56.478 --> 14:59.064
Oh, my God.
That guy just got hit by a car!

15:01.275 --> 15:02.818
No. No driving swan.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.904
Stop the car, Jay. Stop the car!

15:06.488 --> 15:08.324
Wow!

15:08.407 --> 15:10.701
I didn't even fly
through the windshield this time.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.161
I'm getting better at this.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.496
Holy shit! You're insane, Jay.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.041
Yeah! Thank you! Let's make out.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.959
No! You almost killed us.

15:19.043 --> 15:23.964
You're like a--a feral beast that needs
to be put down before it bites a toddler.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.342
Wait. I thought
that's what you liked about me.

15:26.425 --> 15:30.137
I thought so too, until you caused
that violent denim pile up.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.639
"Violent denim pile up"?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.016
That's what I call
my threesomes with Jay Leno

15:34.099 --> 15:36.268
and his lovely wife of 40 years,

15:36.352 --> 15:37.519
Mavis Leno.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.979
Oh, I see.

15:39.063 --> 15:43.609
Perfect Matthew doesn't want
a "hit-and-run on his permanent record."

15:43.692 --> 15:45.694
You probably don't think
I should be driving.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.822
Of course not!
You just crashed into a fire hydrant, Jay!

15:48.906 --> 15:49.740
You know what?

15:49.823 --> 15:52.952
Maybe a wolf and a swan
are just too different.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.913
One's a dog,
and the other's a water chicken.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.624
"A water chicken"?
How are we in the same grade?

15:58.707 --> 16:00.042
Yeah. I get it, Matthew.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.211
You're better than me,
you're smarter than me,

16:02.294 --> 16:04.630
and you never use
your toenails as a toothpick.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.465
Well, guess what,

16:06.548 --> 16:08.884
Mr. Fancy Fountain at the Mall?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.971
I don't wanna go
to the New Year's party with you anymore.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.473
Well, good, because I don't wanna
go to the party with you.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.643
Perfect. Sounds like
we're all getting what we want.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.228
-Oh…

16:19.728 --> 16:21.855
Okay, last one.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.817
I'm gonna slide this down.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.986
Ow! Oh, it hurts.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.990
Of course it hurts, Titties.
You're tender-headed. It'll get easier.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.410
-And you look amazing! Babe alert!

16:34.493 --> 16:35.744
More like Amber Alert.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.455
Who the fuck is this ugly bitch
that kidnapped Missy?

16:38.539 --> 16:41.333
Hey, Missy?
Are you in there?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.085
Jessi? What the hell do you want?

16:43.168 --> 16:45.254
I came to apologize.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.464
Hell no! Tell her to get her raggedy ass

16:47.548 --> 16:48.507
-out of here.
-Um…

16:48.590 --> 16:49.800
Maybe you should hear her out.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.802
Usually, when a white chick
shows up at our house,

16:51.885 --> 16:53.721
they've come to put their face
in Lena's puss.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.765
Well, that's not my preference,
but maybe you're right.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.184
-Okay, bye, Quinta!
-Have fun getting eaten out.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.602
Hey.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.897
You know, if the apology doesn't work,
eating her out is a good Plan B.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.400
Um, I… like your hair.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.986
Boom! If Jessi likes it,
you know it's trash.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.362
Yeah, I'm kinda busy.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.198
So if you're just gonna stand there
like some dumbass statue…

17:13.282 --> 17:14.908
Right, right, right. Sorry.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.411
Um, so, speaking of dumbasses…

17:18.704 --> 17:24.126
…I would like to apologize for engaging
in dumbassery of the highest order.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.544
Ooph, I farted that one.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.464
Jessi, I think it's time to do oral.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.466
Oh, that apology was weak!

17:30.549 --> 17:32.801
Missy, tell this redheaded potato
to fuck off.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.845
You were supposed to be my friend.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.931
-And you completely bulldozed me. Twice.
-Mm-hmm!

17:38.015 --> 17:40.225
-I know. I did do that.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.771
It was shitty,
and I feel like such an asshole,

17:43.854 --> 17:46.106
and I really am so sorry.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.524
And I miss you.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.776
Boo, you whore!

17:48.859 --> 17:50.611
Yeah. I kinda miss you too.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.904
What are you doing?

17:51.987 --> 17:55.574
This asshole admitted she's an asshole.
Why are you giving her an out?

17:55.657 --> 17:56.992
Because she's eating shit,

17:57.076 --> 17:59.495
and it's not often
you see an asshole eating shit.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.954
Usually it's quite the opposite.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.123
Maybe I'll see you at the party tonight?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.374
Yeah, maybe.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.710
Great. Um, bye, Missy.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.669
Bye, Jessi.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.716
What the hell was that?
"Bye, Jessi. Maybe I'll go to the party."

18:12.800 --> 18:15.010
I don't want to be
hateful anymore, Rochelle.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.345
I'm a loving person!

18:16.428 --> 18:19.014
-You're a fucking dork!
-Yeah, I'm a dork.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.183
-And I love that about myself.
-What?

18:21.266 --> 18:24.436
-I love my dorky mom, my dorky dad…
-Oh, shit!

18:24.520 --> 18:26.855
-…and his dorky radish bra.
-Fuck all them!

18:26.939 --> 18:30.859
-And you know what? I love dorky carob!
-No!

18:30.943 --> 18:31.777
-Yes!
-Oh!

18:31.860 --> 18:33.821
-No!
-It's delicious, caffeine-free,

18:33.904 --> 18:35.364
and packed with calcium!

18:35.447 --> 18:36.365
-Ahh!
-Amen!

18:36.448 --> 18:38.826
And heck, I love you, Mona!

18:38.909 --> 18:41.161
-I love you too, darling.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.747
You flimsy bitches are pathetic.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.374
Well, you're not.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.293
You've really helped me
to stand up for myself, Rochelle.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.795
And darn it, I gotta say it.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.380
Don't you dare.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.589
-I love you too!

18:52.673 --> 18:54.383
-Ah!

18:54.466 --> 18:56.510
-Oh, shit!

18:58.762 --> 19:00.889
Oh, my God, Rochelle. Are you okay?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.433
I… am… fabulous!

19:03.517 --> 19:04.810
Just fabulous.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.728
Look at my cute-ass wings!

19:06.812 --> 19:08.480
I missed being a lovebug.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.899
Yeah, I missed being a lovebug too!

19:10.983 --> 19:12.568
You look amazing, by the way!

19:12.651 --> 19:14.361
Almost as good as your hair, girl.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.780
You like it?
I knew you were lying.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.492
I was, baby girl. I was just hangry.
You know how that is.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.077
So let me get this straight.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.039
You're using me and this whole show
to work through your own shit

19:26.123 --> 19:27.291
from when you were a kid?

19:27.374 --> 19:31.128
Well, mine and all the other writers',
but… but yeah, mostly mine.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.296
What the fuck?

19:32.379 --> 19:35.757
Where do you get the gall
to create me just to torture me?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.301
Great use of the word "gall."

19:37.384 --> 19:39.636
No, you're the writer,
you wrote that line.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.597
Y-you're just complimenting yourself.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.683
No, we're writing this together
right now, you and me.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.852
Look, it's blank.
What do you want to say next?

19:46.977 --> 19:49.062
I want to know what I'm doing up here.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.691
Well, you demanded to be up here
because you're such a hateful little shit

19:52.774 --> 19:54.359
and you wanted somebody to blame.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.486
Honestly, you're making me look bad.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.905
You're making me look bad.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.781
We're making each other look bad.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.909
Okay, so what the hell are we
supposed to do about it?

20:01.992 --> 20:05.787
Well, personally, I'm doing quite well,
but maybe you could go fuck yourself.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.040
-What?
-I'm kidding. I'm joking.

20:08.123 --> 20:11.627
This scene needs some jokes,
but honestly, all joking aside,

20:11.710 --> 20:13.503
you are being a whiny little bitch.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.714
You know what? Fuck you, Nick Kroll.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.591
This is my life.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.843
I'm being screwed over at every turn…

20:19.927 --> 20:21.887
…and everybody hates me.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.140
Yeah, because hate is
what you are putting out there, man!

20:25.224 --> 20:28.310
It's not my fault. Walter came in and--

20:28.393 --> 20:29.269
No, no.

20:29.353 --> 20:33.065
No. I don't wanna hear about Walter,
and I don't want to hear about Rick.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.524
Okay, man?

20:34.608 --> 20:37.277
We all have
our own monsters, hormones,

20:37.361 --> 20:39.112
anxiety, depression, hate.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.406
It's all about how you deal with them.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.325
Your monsters are you.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.035
-What?
-Yeah.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.411
It's all you, buddy.

20:46.495 --> 20:50.999
So all the shit I've been
blaming Walter for is kind of my fault?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.042
Yeah, basically.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.920
You wanted to know who's in charge?
Well, it's you.

20:55.003 --> 20:55.837
Fuck me.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.715
Yeah!
That's why I said, "Go fuck yourself!"

20:58.799 --> 21:00.467
So, I'm all alone?

21:00.550 --> 21:04.263
No, you got your crazy family
that loves you too much,

21:04.346 --> 21:07.307
you got all your horny little friends
that jerk off all the time.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.936
Oh, speaking of, there's the horniest
of your little pervy buddies now.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.439
-Y-you mean Andrew?
-Yeah. Oh, look, he's all sweaty.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.234
I think he's been looking for you,
or jerking off, or both.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.653
Wow. He really is a good friend, isn't he?

21:19.736 --> 21:21.280
Yeah, he really is.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.157
So it's just about the end of the scene.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.827
Is there anything else
you'd like to ask your future self?

21:26.910 --> 21:28.287
Yeah. Does, um…

21:28.370 --> 21:30.706
Does my, uh, my dick get bigger?

21:30.789 --> 21:33.166
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it--it gets bigger.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.711
Does it get, like, like, big?

21:35.794 --> 21:37.045
It--it gets bigger.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.839
Oh. Oh, okay.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.382
Yeah.

21:41.133 --> 21:41.967
Hey, Andrew.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.593
Oh, Nick, I found you!

21:43.677 --> 21:47.055
I can't believe you came for me,
even though I've been such an asshole.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.141
Listen, I know how tempting it is to hate,

21:49.224 --> 21:50.976
but I'm choosing love, honey.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.311
Because I love you, Nick.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.729
I love you too, buddy.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.523
-Oh! That melts my heart.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.441
Walter!

21:57.524 --> 22:00.277
Hello, my big-headed angel baby.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.194
You're back.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.947
Sweetheart, I never left.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.991
Well, but you were a hate worm.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.993
And I loved being a hate worm,

22:08.076 --> 22:11.204
but I hated not being a lovebug.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.207
Wow, they're really
"going through changes," huh, Maury?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.418
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the song. LOL.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.587
Listen, can I write my own jokes again?

22:18.670 --> 22:20.255
No, I--I don't like saying 'em.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.674
-Hold on. You voice me?
-Yeah.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.719
Oh, bummer! I thought I was Will Arnett.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.512
Yeah, a lot of people think that.

22:27.596 --> 22:32.392
-Wow, that's, uh… That's disappointing.
-Well, maybe people think that I'm Bojack.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.977
No, nobody thinks that.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.062
Yeah, I know.

22:35.145 --> 22:38.398
-All right! I'm DJ Pendejo,

22:38.482 --> 22:42.402
and this is Devin and Devon's
Re-New Year's Rockin' New Year's Eve!

22:42.486 --> 22:43.945
-And now,

22:44.029 --> 22:46.948
to re-New Year their vows, your hosts,

22:47.032 --> 22:51.328
Ryan Seahorse and Seahorse Ronan!

22:51.411 --> 22:55.040
Devin, I vow to look at the ground
when other girls are nearby.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.041
Even my mommy.

22:56.124 --> 22:59.628
Devon, I vow to be your loving wife

22:59.711 --> 23:01.129
until high school starts.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.049
-Okay, make sure you find someone

23:04.132 --> 23:08.011
to do kissies with at midnight,
or you'll turn into a pumpkin,

23:08.095 --> 23:11.390
and I should know because I'm a pumpkin.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.893
I don't think I'll be
kissing anyone tonight, Steve.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.646
I guess I'm just destined
to ride this Earth alone

23:17.729 --> 23:20.899
in a car full of pants
with no one in the passenger seat.

23:20.982 --> 23:24.486
I have seeds
and orange spaghetti in my brain.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.280
Oh, all right! Music. That's a fun choice.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.158
Oh, God, there's Jessi.
I think I should go talk to her.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.243
Yeah, you do that.

23:31.326 --> 23:34.871
I'm gonna hit the dance floor
and jiggle this creamy bowl of chowder.

23:36.331 --> 23:39.000
Wow. Andrew's butt is hypnotic.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.127
I can't look away.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.672
Yeah, it really is shockingly
the story of the season.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.091
Uh, hey, guys. Happy New Year!

23:46.174 --> 23:48.051
Missy! You came!

23:48.135 --> 23:49.845
Are you here to kick my ass again?

23:49.928 --> 23:51.096
Lead with love, baby.

23:51.179 --> 23:54.766
No, I'm--I'm here to apologize
for gossiping about you

23:54.850 --> 23:56.351
and for ripping out your retainer

23:56.435 --> 23:58.645
and dunking your favorite highlighter
in the boys' toilet.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.021
-What?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.065
This was before
I actually got to beat your ass.

24:02.149 --> 24:05.318
Okay, well, I guess it's a new year,

24:05.402 --> 24:07.154
so let's start fresh?

24:07.237 --> 24:09.531
I'd like that very, very much.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.117
May I ask, is anyone else
feeling the gravitational pull

24:12.200 --> 24:14.578
from Andrew's sweet ass
to the dance floor right now?

24:14.661 --> 24:16.288
Yeah, let's do it!

24:16.371 --> 24:19.332
Hey, Jessi, can we, uh…
Can we talk for a second?

24:19.416 --> 24:22.043
What does this
little Bilbo Baggins bitch want?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.128
What's up, Nick?

24:23.211 --> 24:27.340
Um, I just wanted to say that--
that I've been a real asshole to you.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.300
Yeah, no shit.

24:28.383 --> 24:31.386
Just 'cause you didn't like me back
doesn't mean I get to hate you.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.888
Yeah! Double no shit.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.474
And I'm sorry, 'cause it's my fault,

24:35.557 --> 24:36.808
and I totally fucked up.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.394
Oh! I bet you a woman wrote that line.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.022
Um, thanks. I appreciate that.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.148
Happy New Year, Jessi?

24:43.231 --> 24:44.316
Happy New Year, Nick.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.860
Kiss him. Then headbutt him.
And then kiss him again.

24:46.943 --> 24:49.196
-What?
-I know! I know I'm crazy.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.947
-It's New Year's Eve!

24:51.740 --> 24:52.574
Hey, guys.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.994
Listen up, Jay Bilzerian,
you are my destiny.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.329
Lola, what are you doing?

24:57.412 --> 25:00.665
Jay, what I did to you
was assuredly heinous.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.752
-And I feel grape remorse about it.
-You do?

25:03.835 --> 25:06.004
I know we've had our rough patches, Jay,

25:06.087 --> 25:09.466
but I truly think
we're perfect for each other.

25:09.549 --> 25:12.135
We're both passionate, deeply neglected,

25:12.219 --> 25:16.348
and we've redefined horniness
for a generation… 

25:16.431 --> 25:19.142
…insomuch we're meant to be together.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.187
Oh, my God.
Am I actually gonna fight Lola for Jay?

25:22.270 --> 25:23.355
Is that who I am now?

25:23.438 --> 25:26.024
It's who you've always been,
Matty Boom-Boom.

25:26.107 --> 25:29.569
Now go!
Go fight for that uncut beef balloon.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.239
Fuck! Maybe you're right, Lola.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.782
I guess we do make sense.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.869
-Jayzerian RicFlairian Bilzerian!
-Matthew?

25:37.953 --> 25:40.622
I know you said
a wolf and a swan wouldn't work--

25:40.705 --> 25:43.458
-'Cause one's a dog and the other's--
-A water chicken, yes.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.460
But you make me happy, Jay.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.673
So I want a wolf,
a hairy, crazy, uncut wolf.

25:49.756 --> 25:53.009
What in the wide world of shorts
is happening right now?

25:53.093 --> 25:55.804
I like him, Lola. What can I say?

25:55.887 --> 25:58.807
Well, too bad.
You're a day late and a dick short.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.934
Jay and I just got back together.
Right, Jay?

26:01.017 --> 26:01.893
Jay, is that true?

26:01.977 --> 26:05.230
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Hold on. Ah, shit!

26:05.313 --> 26:06.690
-Well, Jay?
-Who's it gonna be?

26:06.773 --> 26:10.068
-Yeah, who's it gonna be?
-Matthew, I'm sorry.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.529
-But I'm choosing you.
-What?

26:12.612 --> 26:17.826
And Lola,
you're the one that I'm not choosing,

26:17.909 --> 26:19.619
because Matthew's my choice.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.538
-Oh!
-What the fuck, Jay?

26:21.621 --> 26:22.747
I'm sorry, Lola.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.333
-But I've seen what two wolves can do.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.127
They tear each other apart,

26:27.210 --> 26:29.713
but Matthew makes me feel good.

26:29.796 --> 26:33.466
Maybe it's time I get my sock wet
with a water chicken.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.260
I can't believe you, Jay.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.512
I hope you have a crappy New Year.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.016
All right, folks, we're ten seconds away

26:41.099 --> 26:42.809
-from Rosh Hashanah!

26:42.892 --> 26:44.769
Quick consent to kiss you
in front of everyone?

26:44.853 --> 26:46.438
-Happy wolf!
-Five, four…

26:46.521 --> 26:48.690
-…three, two, one.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.900
-Happy New Year!
-Happy ass!

26:50.984 --> 26:52.944
Ooh, nice ass, Maurice.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.279
If you stick your hand in there,

26:54.362 --> 26:56.156
it'll look like
you're breaking up a fight.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.825
-What if I stick my foot in?

27:00.285 --> 27:04.289
We really put these children
through the wringer this year, didn't we?

27:04.372 --> 27:05.957
We sure as hell did.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.752
No, no, no, no, no.
They did it to themselves.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.796
That's what we learned this season.
We are them.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.257
We're them? Wait. Fuck that. I'm me.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.384
Well, apparently I'm Nick Kroll.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.511
Hold up! I thought you was Will Arnett.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.847
Do you still want
to bury your foot in my ass?

27:20.930 --> 27:22.265
Oh, Maury.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.435
-I want to put my whole head up there.
-Wait, what?

27:25.518 --> 27:27.145
-Ooh!

27:27.228 --> 27:28.355
Yeah!

27:28.438 --> 27:30.815
-Agh…
-Happy New Year, everybody!
