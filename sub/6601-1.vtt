Well, that's because I was up all
night working on new cheers.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.827
You've managed to maintain a C
average and work on new cheers?

Amber, it's not enough to win. I
want to go down in cheer history.

and nobody can take that from you.

Of course not.

say anything. It's your squad.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.987
No, it's not. I weigh just a
couple pounds more than last year.

And that was pushing it.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.827

Well, look,
just lay off the snacks

09:01.541 --> 09:04.210

weight should come right off.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.587
What if it doesn't?

Wow, Brit.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.454
Why didn't you
just rip out her belly ring?

43:22.559 --> 43:24.726
Hey, Leti, if we added
some of this krumping,

43:24.727 --> 43:26.645
it could really get us noticed
by Rihanna.

43:26.646 --> 43:30.315
No. if we change Camille's
choreography, she'll be pissed.

43:30.817 --> 43:34.945
Yo, Leti. Camille ain't even here.
If you're in charge, act like it.

That was great.

44:27.749 --> 44:29.541
Well, I came up with the steps.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.168
But we all contributed.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.003
Yeah. It was a group effort.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.124
I had nothing to do with it.

Hell, no.

44:45.975 --> 44:49.853
Camille, don't blame them. It was
my idea to change the routine.

44:49.854 --> 44:50.979
Why?

44:50.980 --> 44:53.649
Because half of the moves
in your routine are illegal.

A cheer cop?

No, girl, you can't do that.

for vulgarity.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.872
I know the rules.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.792
Then why do you keep
breaking them?

45:11.793 --> 45:15.837
Because the things we do
get us noticed.

45:15.838 --> 45:18.757
Even when we don't win,
they say we're the best.

45:19.008 --> 45:21.218
Wouldn't you rather they say
you were winners?

45:21.761 --> 45:22.886
I mean, come on, Camille,

45:22.887 --> 45:25.263
if we play by the books and add
this krumping, we can't lose.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.683

your old squad pulled on you?

behind your back?

45:31.646 --> 45:32.813
No.

And if there was one girl who
thought she could run your squad

45:36.401 --> 45:39.820
better than you could, what
would you have done to her?

45:40.446 --> 45:41.780
There was.

45:43.825 --> 45:45.992
I should've told her to stop.

45:45.993 --> 45:49.871
And see, that's the difference
between me and you, white girl.

55:20.276 --> 55:21.609
JESSE: This is the beach.

55:24.238 --> 55:27.365
Tar beach. That's what they called
it where my grandparents hooked up.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.158
Where did they immigrate from?
Brooklyn.

55:29.868 --> 55:30.910
For real.

55:31.537 --> 55:33.830
They say it was really
dangerous back in the day.

55:34.623 --> 55:37.263
Funny thing is, they moved here to
keep their kids away from gangs.

55:37.835 --> 55:38.876
Wrong.

55:43.382 --> 55:45.091
Everything looks better up here.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.885
Things do when you step back
and take a good look.

55:51.390 --> 55:53.558
You know,
Camille's right about me.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.977
The squad's the only place
I'll ever fit in.

55:56.478 --> 55:58.896
But she needs to know
she can't mess with me.

55:59.106 --> 56:01.774
Camille can take care of herself.
She used to be a gangbanger.

56:02.109 --> 56:04.027
What? She could kill me!

56:04.028 --> 56:05.361
I'm playing with you, Britney.

56:06.280 --> 56:09.615
That is so not funny!
<i>I saw Boyz n The Hood.</i>

56:10.034 --> 56:13.369
And I saw Clueless, but I
still came up here with you.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.454
Yeah.

56:16.623 --> 56:19.584
Guess that shows how little
we know about each other.

56:23.213 --> 56:24.213
So far.

56:25.174 --> 56:26.674
Jesse, I have a...

56:33.140 --> 56:34.932
I thought you wanted me to.

56:36.852 --> 56:39.771
I did, but... I have a...

56:42.024 --> 56:43.232
I have to go.

56:46.362 --> 56:47.528
(DOOR CLOSING)

56:47.529 --> 56:49.155
Who's playing with who?

56:52.951 --> 56:54.243
AMBER: So,
<i>now you call me back?</i>

56:54.244 --> 56:56.954
Look, I know you're mad at me,
but I have dirt.

56:57.706 --> 56:59.415
Spill.
Okay.

57:00.667 --> 57:02.502
I kissed another boy tonight.

57:02.503 --> 57:05.713
Who? Where? His name's Jesse.
On the mouth.

57:05.714 --> 57:07.173
No.
Yes.

57:07.466 --> 57:09.050
What if Brad finds out?

57:09.051 --> 57:11.219
Brad's
been studying with Winnie.

57:11.220 --> 57:12.345
So?

57:12.346 --> 57:15.223
He's our star athlete, Brit.
When did he ever study?

57:16.892 --> 57:18.935
So, when you say study,
you mean...

57:19.103 --> 57:23.106
Look, we both know the only reason she
wants Brad is because he's yours.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.067
So, what are you
going to do about it?

57:26.068 --> 57:27.193
I don't know.

57:27.653 --> 57:30.613
Well, you better figure it out
before the homecoming dance Friday.

57:30.614 --> 57:34.367
Oh, shit. I totally forgot about the dance.
What am I going to do?

57:34.701 --> 57:37.412
LDK, but you really need
to think about this.

57:37.746 --> 57:41.165
You've already lost your team.
Do you want to lose Brad, too?

57:47.548 --> 57:49.882
...high school boys. They
be all up on you and stuff.

57:49.883 --> 57:51.134
I know, girl.
They be doing the most.

57:51.135 --> 57:53.261
Who you going with?
Well, I was thinking...

57:53.262 --> 57:55.638
Hey, guys. I have some bad news.
What's up?

57:56.390 --> 57:58.391
I can't cheer at the game
on Friday.

57:58.392 --> 57:59.600
Why not?

57:59.601 --> 58:00.977
Because...
This better be good.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.062
Oh, it is.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.191
My dog died.

58:10.529 --> 58:12.488
You're missing our game
for a dog?

58:12.489 --> 58:14.782
He wasn't just any dog.

58:14.950 --> 58:16.617
I've had him
since I was a little girl.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.704
Aww. What the dog's name?

58:25.711 --> 58:28.629
Nike. His name was Nike.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.716
Wait. You named your dog
after a shoe?

58:32.009 --> 58:33.551
Your sister's named after a car.

58:33.552 --> 58:35.553
No, Mercedes is named
after my grandmother.

58:35.554 --> 58:36.721
Whatever.

58:36.722 --> 58:39.640
Anyway, Nike's memorial
service is on Friday.

58:39.641 --> 58:41.726
You're having a funeral
for a dog?

58:42.269 --> 58:44.187
He wasn't just a dog.

58:44.563 --> 58:46.564
He was a member of the family.

58:46.565 --> 58:49.066
Dang, man. White people
are crazy about their pets.

58:49.067 --> 58:50.193
KIRRESHA: Mmm-hmm.

58:50.194 --> 58:51.360
Yes, we are.

58:51.528 --> 58:54.238
And I know you'll hate me
for missing the game,

58:54.573 --> 58:56.657
but I know Nike
would have wanted it this way.

58:57.701 --> 59:01.245
Hey, who am I to stand between
a white girl and her dead dog?

59:02.122 --> 59:03.456
Thank you, Camille.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

59:16.053 --> 59:18.471
It's a long drive
back to Pacific Vista.

59:18.472 --> 59:20.223
BRITNEY: I'm almost ready!

59:21.934 --> 59:24.769
Hey, yo. Britney lives here?
I've delivered here.

Damn, my house
is nicer than this.

59:46.124 --> 59:47.291
I'll get it.

59:49.962 --> 59:51.963
Hey, it's the pizza dude.

59:52.256 --> 59:55.299
Man, you're a cheer-queer, too?
You're never going to get laid.

59:55.300 --> 59:57.009
Brad, who was at the...

59:58.470 --> 59:59.554
Wow.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:04.767
You people are really dressed
up for a dog's funeral.

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:10.106
Oh, babe, did your dog die?

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:14.110
Wait a minute. No.
You don't have a dog, do you?

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:16.946
Look, Brad,
I'll explain it to you later.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.615
Jesse, what are you guys
doing here?

01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:23.077
She told me about your dog, so I
came along to offer my condolences.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.641
But I see
you've already been condoled.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.708
Dude, you have a problem?
Dude, step off.

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:30.334
Dude, I will beat you down!

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:31.775
Dude, I'll beat
the dude out of you!

01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:33.421
Whoa, whoa! Enough.

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:37.508
Look, I never had a dog.
I just...

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:41.512
I just needed an excuse to
get out of the game tonight.

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:42.847
Why?

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.851
Because I promised I'd go
to homecoming with Brad.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.812
And Brad is...
Her boyfriend.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.772
Yeah, see, it's funny 'cause she
never mentioned a boyfriend.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:53.566
CAMILLE: She never mentioned
a lot of things.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.651
Like the fact that she's a liar.

01:00:56.445 --> 01:00:59.739
I mean, were you even really a captain
or did you make that shit up, too?

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.033
BRAD: Britney,
what's going on?

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.285
Look,
it's just a misunderstanding.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:07.204
Yeah, I misunderstood a lot.

01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:14.629
You're off the squad.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.505

No.

who you're cheering for.

a surprise for you. Just go.

Okay.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.295

Hey, hey!

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.974
Brad, is this what I think it is?
Well, open it up.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:13.938
It's a surprise. I wanted tonight
to be special or something.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.025
What is this?

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:19.902
That is our room key.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:23.447
You're welcome. You know, I
just figured your first time

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:26.117
might be a little bit
more special and romantic

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:27.702
if you had it in a Marriott.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:31.372
Brad, it doesn't matter
where we are. I'm not ready.

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:35.626
You know what, Brit? This
little tease game you're doing?

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:36.794
It's getting pretty old.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:39.315
Oh, really? Is that why you started
sneaking around with Winnie?

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:42.133
What?

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:45.177
Now is the time.
Get your ass up.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.303
Okay.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:51.058
Who told you that? Amber? It was Amber.
You know what? She was making that up.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.226
And why would she do that?

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:55.062
Oh, I don't know.
Jealousy, maybe.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.565
You know how many girls
want me at this school?

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:58.983
It's ridiculous.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.403
Well, the question is
how many of them do you want?

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:04.822
Britney. Hi, sweetie.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:06.824
Glad you made it.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:09.827
I'm so sorry for not telling you
guys about me cheering again.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.746
I totally understand
why you didn't,

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:14.790
especially after seeing
that cheer-trocity of a squad.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.500
Can you say nasty?

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.585
Nasty.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:22.089
They're like the bottom
of the cheer tier.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:26.886
There is this one girl that is so fat, she
looks like she swallowed two Briannas.

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:34.351
Her name is KIRRESHA, and she's
got more heart in one ass cheek

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.395
than you do in your entire body.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:38.230
She's a real friend.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.191
Then you're done.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.234
And why is that?

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.236
Because after you make friends
with those people,

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.655
you start shopping with them,
then you're dating one,

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.325
and the next thing you know, you're
going to be on some bad talk show

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.868
screaming at your baby daddy.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:57.082
What? I cannot believe
you just said that.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:00.586
Yeah, that's so racist.
Oh, bite me, Crouching Tiger.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:03.267
BRITNEY: Winnie, you're such a candy cane.
And you're such a wigger.

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:06.050
Oh, that's it.
Brad, hold my shit.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.427
Oh, okay.

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.639
Yeah, I'm not gonna get any ass from
you, but I'll hold your purse, yeah.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.349
Way to make me feel
like a man, Brit.

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.726
Let's do a cheer.

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:17.686
Now? In the middle of a dance?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.188
And a fight?

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:20.928
Let's do it for
all timer's sake.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:23.442
That's old times' sake.

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:25.778
You say tomato.
I say potato.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.114
What do you think, Winnie?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.828
I think Britney doesn't have what
it takes to be a Pirate anymore.

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:36.038
That sounds like
a challenge to me, Brit.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.415
Oh, I'm sure
it was meant as an insult.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.919
Everybody.
Kill the music, Ronnie.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.338
Everybody make room for us,
please.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.466
We have a special surprise.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:51.512
Our ex-cheer captain, Britney
Allen, is with us tonight.

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:56.100
So, in her honor, we would like to do
our Pirate introduction cheer for you.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:03.399
Although I'm captain now, I
think Britney should lead us.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:05.818
Thanks, Winnie.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:09.446

captain at your new school.

<i>But now it's time to announce this
year's homecoming king and queen.</i>

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.196
Hey, shabooya.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:34.239
In case you change your mind,

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.201
we have that hotel room
till noon tomorrow. Okay?

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:41.705
<i>Well, no surprise here, Pacific Vista.
Your homecoming king is Brad Warner!</i>

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.803
Great, now he's really
going to want to celebrate.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:58.013
WINNIE: I'm sure
it won't be with you.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.599
He only brought you here because
he feels sorry for you,

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.400
and he didn't want to
dump you over the phone.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:04.853
Really?

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.357
Well, if he wanted
to break up with me, Winnie,

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:10.734
then why'd he get us a room?

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:15.364
<i>And this year's queen
is Winnie Harper!</i>

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.116
Congratulations.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.123

<i>I had sex with Brad Warner.</i>

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.714
What? What?
Oh, my God.

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:38.345
<i>How do you like that, Britney? I
finally beat you at something.</i>

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.347
<i>Now tell her, Brad.</i>

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:43.308
What are you doing?

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:47.312
<i>Britney, Britney, Britney! For once
it's not going to be all about you.</i>

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.565
<i>Now tell her.</i>

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:55.654
<i>Okay, babe. Babe, okay,
I know this looks bad, okay?</i>

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:59.366
<i>It's not as bad as it sounds. I was
thinking of you the whole time.</i>

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.827
<i>What, the whole two minutes?</i>

01:08:05.457 --> 01:08:07.291
Brad, Winnie.

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:12.129
Thank you.
BOTH: What?

01:08:13.048 --> 01:08:16.175
<i>Brad, I can't tell you
how much of a relief it is</i>

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:17.885
<i>not to be
your girlfriend anymore.</i>

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:20.095

Well, you're a pig.</i>

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:26.518
<i>And Winnie, you're just too much of a
backstabber to have any real friends.</i>

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.564
<i>But there's one thing
you're right about.</i>

01:08:31.483 --> 01:08:33.649
<i>I don't have what it takes
to be a Pirate anymore.</i>

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.385
<i>You guys enjoy
the rest of your night.</i>

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.448
MALE STUDENT: Go, girl!

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:19.571
Oh, no, she didn't!

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:22.407
She got her nerve.

01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:25.327
What do you want?

01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:31.291
Look, I never should have ditched you
guys for some stupid dance. I'm sorry.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.127
Sorry don't make up
or dissing us.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.294
BOTH: Mmm-hmm.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:35.504
Yeah, I know.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.591
I thought
I needed to be the leader,

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:44.710
but it turns out I just needed
to be a part of the squad.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.975
And now it's too late.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.060
But I wanted to come
wish you guys good luck,

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:52.895
and I'll be proud
to watch you win.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.900
Well, thanks, and see you.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:03.407
Look, it's hip-hop Barbie
and her Wu-Tang Clan.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:06.618
You better get your friend
before she gets a beat down.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:09.371
Oh, please do.
We're not friends.

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:11.123
We never were.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:15.169
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
I could just cry. But I won't.

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.921
Well, you will be crying
when they beat you.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.756
When they beat us?

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:22.426
Don't tell me you're not
cheering with them anymore.

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:25.470
I thought once you go black,
you never go back.

01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:29.308
FYI, it doesn't matter whether
I'm cheering with them or not.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:30.976
I know how good they are.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:34.146
Oh, you've lost your cheer-sanity if
you think this pathetic little squad

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:35.397
can even compete with us.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:36.982
Oh, I know they can.
No.

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:39.526
So, you'd better bring it all,
white girl.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:41.486
Oh, "white girl"?

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:44.198
Remember
when you used to be one?

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.952
But don't act like you forget.
You know we always bring it,

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.331
white trash.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.836
Please let me cut her.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.339
Look, Camille. I don't know
what their routines are like,

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.341
but I do know that they've
really good gymnasts,

01:11:02.342 --> 01:11:04.927
so they'll probably throw
some fancy stunts.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.262
But what you guys have that
they don't is your spirit,

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.389
so you really got to go for it
if you want to win.

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:13.518
You mean, if we want to win.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:18.065
Wait, are you going to let me
cheer with you guys?

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:20.817
I kind of have to for the way
you stood up for us, Britney.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.570
You called me Britney.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.240
Go get dressed, white girl.

01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:28.617
I don't have to.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.287
Oh, so she just knew I was
gonna let her cheer, huh?

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:35.499
No, but I was hoping you would.

Hey, what's up?

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.431
Camille's gonna let me
cheer with you guys.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:52.432
