<i>You snap the band on your wrist</i>

00:03.320 --> 00:06.051
<i>when your thoughts and feelings
overwhelm you.</i>

00:06.200 --> 00:09.044
I'm sorry. I want to remember' I really do.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.567
- I know everything.
- What are you talking about?

00:11.720 --> 00:14.246
Paul confessed, Katie.
There's no need to cover for him.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.925
<i>You need to get your story straight.</i>

00:16.079 --> 00:19.402
<i>According to her, there's been no affair,
just some kind of sexual assault.</i>

00:19.560 --> 00:21.722
Jesus, Paul, what did you do to her?

00:21.880 --> 00:24.326
When I met Peter, I already had a boyfriend.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.211
That boyfriend was Tom,
who became my husband.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.727
<i>- And you never told him what happened?
- No.</i>

00:29.880 --> 00:31.211
Who are you?

00:31.360 --> 00:34.204
Excuse me, ma'am.
The divers might have found something.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.966
- Where's Mummy sleeping?
- In there.

00:37.640 --> 00:43.682
In his own mind, he believes he has the right
to decide who lives and who dies.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.001
Peter?

01:47.160 --> 01:48.969
Stella.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.520
Help me. I don't wanna die.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.930
Stop shaking.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.608
Stan again. Steady hand.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.446
- Is this your phone?
- Uh-huh.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.890
The child locks are on.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.646
I don't understand. What's happening?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.884
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.562
Where are you taking me?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.410
Are my babies all right?

06:54.640 --> 06:56.529
Yes.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.409
And Tom?

06:59.600 --> 07:03.605
You mean the drunk sleeping on the sofa?
He's dead to the world.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.728
Why are you doing this to me?

07:21.160 --> 07:22.650
What is this?

07:23.680 --> 07:25.728
You went to the police, Rose.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.970
I didn't.

07:29.080 --> 07:32.368
You sat with a police officer,
probably for hours...

07:33.040 --> 07:35.168
...and put together that likeness oi me-.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.088
This doesn't even look like you.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.847
You've made my life very difficult.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.244
But...

07:51.400 --> 07:53.368
you're not him...

07:55.240 --> 07:57.242
...are you?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.483
No.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.051
I'm not him.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.441
Well, then you have nothing to fear.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.171
Please take me home. Please.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.881
It wasn't me.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.522
Perhaps it was that other girl,
the one who survived.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.684
The caption said it was nine years ago.
It was you.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.362
No, it wasn't me.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.601
The thought that you could be him...

08:35.760 --> 08:39.650
that you could be the man...
it never crossed my mind.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.851
Have you forgotten
what happened between us?

08:45.920 --> 08:47.809
No.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.167
No, I haven't forgotten.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.202
But that doesn't mean...

08:56.520 --> 08:58.841
We were just trying things.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.889
Doing things.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.008
It was just something that happened.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.363
Too much to drink.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.042
It was a lifetime ago.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.890
I'm married. I'm a mother now.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.524
Maybe it was some other girl,
some other girl that you were seeing.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.682
There was no other girl.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.361
You were the only girl.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.802
And you've betrayed me.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.525
No.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.322
No. No!

10:49.400 --> 10:50.811
No.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.971
No.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.122
No.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.682
Nancy!

11:22.280 --> 11:23.645
Time for breakfast!

11:23.800 --> 11:25.802
I'm coming, Daddy!

11:34.680 --> 11:36.489
Nancy.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.809
- What are they doing?
- Looking {or him, stupid-.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.245
What?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.847
- They must think he lives round here.
- Oh, my God, seriously.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.325
That's the last time I'm sleeping over at yours.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.522
Right-handed professional decorating shears.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.440
29 centimetre overall length.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.211
17.5 centimetre cutting blade.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.850
Just under seven inches.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.604
How long were they in the water?

12:38.760 --> 12:41.286
I'm assuming since the night of the 20th.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.531
We can examine them for trace
and contact evidence -

12:46.680 --> 12:48.842
blood, fingerprints, fibres -

12:49.000 --> 12:52.243
but it will be degraded
after that amount of time under water.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.482
They were quite deep in the silt.

12:55.560 --> 12:59.770
Start with the fingerprints and...
and see if anything else can be cleaned-.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.202
We need to fast-track them.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.811
- Where'd you put Rose?
- Er, not here yet, ma'am.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.685
I have her mobile number'
You call her place of work?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.490
Mm-hm.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.446
<i>You have one new message.</i>

14:36.920 --> 14:39.924
<i>Ruse, this is Detective Superintendent Gibson.</i>

14:40.080 --> 14:41.445
<i>We were due to meet today.</i>

14:41.600 --> 14:44.046
<i>Please ring and let me know
when you'll be here.</i>

14:44.200 --> 14:46.726
<i>I do have further questions for you.</i>

14:46.880 --> 14:49.326
<i>It's essential that you come in today.</i>

14:49.480 --> 14:51.562
<i>Please call me.</i>

14:54.680 --> 14:57.286
Her first appointment at her work
was at eight this morning.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.044
She didn't turn up. No word from her.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.851
Several patients have not received
their radiology treatments.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.606
Her department at the hospital
have been trying to reach her.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.250
This has never happened before.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.002
No reply from home.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.085
See if the hospital human resources
has a next-of-kin number for Rose.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.968
<i>When was the last time
that you saw her?</i>

15:19.120 --> 15:21.361
She left in the early hours of the morning-.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.570
<i>What time?</i>

15:23.720 --> 15:26.326
Um..'I'm not sure, I was sleeping.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.645
So how do you know?

15:28.800 --> 15:30.325
<i>Um, she left me a note.</i>

15:31.520 --> 15:32.965
Do you still have that note?

15:33.120 --> 15:35.009
Yeah.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.049
<i>Please keep it safe.</i>

15:37.200 --> 15:39.282
Why? What's this about?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.890
<i>Where are you, Tom?</i>

15:42.040 --> 15:43.929
I'm... I'm in the park.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.401
<i>Go home Meet me there.</i>

15:47.120 --> 15:49.122
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

17:10.960 --> 17:13.566
Are you aware that Rose
was due to see me today?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.848
Yes, I am.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.763
And do you know why?

17:17.920 --> 17:19.968
I think so.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.608
How does she normally get to work?

17:24.760 --> 17:26.922
She drives.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.287
- And her car is gone?
- Yes.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.608
Anything strike you as unusual this morning,
Tom?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.924
Uh, maybe one thing.
I'm sure it's nothing.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.286
Go on.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.489
Her bite guard was over there,
on the side.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.650
- Her...?
- Bite guard.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.724
She wears it at night
to stop her from grinding her teeth.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.245
Normally, when she wakes,

17:51.400 --> 17:54.529
she puts it in its wee box
at the side of the bed and...

17:54.680 --> 17:57.251
at night, she rinses it and puts it back in.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.604
And this is her handwriting?

18:01.760 --> 18:04.411
- Yes.
- Her normal hand?

18:04.560 --> 18:05.561
Yes.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.087
Should I be worried?

18:08.240 --> 18:09.730
Why are you here?

18:09.880 --> 18:13.487
Just to look after you
while your daddy answers some questions.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.721
Look what I found.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.969
It's sad, isn't it?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.690
It's very sad.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.607
You...weren't aware of her getting out of bed?

18:37.480 --> 18:38.970
I wasn't in bed with her.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.649
Where were you?

18:42.800 --> 18:44.325
I slept on the sofa.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.321
Why?

18:48.320 --> 18:50.641
We'd argued.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.802
What about?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.446
She told me she was coming into see you...

18:58.280 --> 19:02.729
"that she had already spoken to you
once before, and she told me why.

19:04.040 --> 19:08.364
And what she told me
explained something that has always...

19:10.320 --> 19:12.163
...that I'd never understood before-.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.002
What was that?

19:15.680 --> 19:17.762
A period at university...

19:18.440 --> 19:21.250
...when suddenly she wouldn't talk to me...

19:21.400 --> 19:23.971
see me at all, for three months.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.768
Then one day she called.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.888
We started seeing each other again.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.122
We got married soon after.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.722
How did you feel...

19:37.440 --> 19:39.488
...when she told you why she'd withdrawn?

19:40.760 --> 19:42.444
I was upset.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.361
Angry.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.042
- Violently anew?
- No.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.690
No, never.

19:51.280 --> 19:54.045
- Angry enough to make her leave you?
- No.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.682
I don't... I don't think so.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.531
- Can I help you?
- I'm Paul Spector.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.445
Yes. I've been expecting you.
Take a seat.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.927
This is the case file you need.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.482
<i>We're going to need
a number of recent photographs of Rose.</i>

20:50.560 --> 20:52.403
There's quite a lotto choose from.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.768
When was that taken?

20:55.920 --> 20:58.082
That was last year.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.811
That was just last week.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.769
Come in.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.926
Assistant Chief Constable Burns is here, ma'am.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.764
Right.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.923
Stay here, Tom.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.082
I'll be back.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.043
Contact control by radio.
This is Rose Staggs car.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.848
Circulate the details-.

21:40.520 --> 21:44.889
We need to get the family out of there, Jim.
Conduct an initial visual search.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.442
Open all doors, access all rooms,
cupboards, voids.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.489
She might still be in there somewhere.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.802
Stella, you shouldn't be here.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.087
- This isn't a voluntary missing person.
- How do you know?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.402
It's an abduction.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.562
The house is a crime scene.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.805
If Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers,

22:06.960 --> 22:10.851
where's the peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked?

22:11.560 --> 22:13.005
That's the best so far.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.571
Did you learn that at school?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.165
No, from Peter Piper.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.163
Really?

22:18.320 --> 22:19.890
Mummy's friend.

22:20.040 --> 22:24.807
- Your mummy has a friend called Peter Piper?
- Yes. He was here last night.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.365
We made a decision to say that the likeness
was from nine years ago,

22:31.520 --> 22:33.807
and I think we have led him straight to Rose.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.564
- How?
- Oh...

22:36.400 --> 22:38.243
“and I called him Peter, too.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.402
A common enough name.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.130
Why would we be interested
in a likeness from nine years ago?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.089
Because of a precursor crime.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.529
Something that happened in the past

22:48.680 --> 22:50.842
that seems to presage the current crimes,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.210
like a woman being strangled
into unconsciousness by her boyfriend.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.327
I mean, maybe he did that
with every woman that he met.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.084
But what if he only did it once?

23:00.240 --> 23:02.527
How difficult would that be for him to work out?

23:03.400 --> 23:05.050
Rose never reported it.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.604
The boyfriend was never interviewed, charged.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.650
As far as he knows,
it's always remained a private matter.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.243
Until now.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.562
We have made it public.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.643
You should have age-enhanced the picture
and used that instead.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.882
- There's been a development, ma'am.
- Get in.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.202
It's from the daughter, from Nancy.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.441
Go on.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.841
It seems there was someone
in the house last night,

23:36.000 --> 23:37.843
someone who said he was
a friend of her mother's.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.765
Nancy watched them going off,
crossing the street together.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.321
Someone who said he was called Peter.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.929
May I help you?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.684
I'm here to see a patient.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.888
Annie Brawley.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.088
- Why is he here?
- I'm leaving the case 10 Eastwood-.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.685
When did you decide that?

24:40.840 --> 24:43.844
If the task force investigates this,
the media will be all over it.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.890
- We don't need that extra pressure.
- I'm sorry. That's ridiculous,

24:47.040 --> 24:49.281
She's been missing for less than 12 hours.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.444
- It's important we appear not to be overreacting.
- Jim.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.409
You can't see past the killer.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.642
I want all lines of inquiry looked at -

24:56.800 --> 25:00.088
marital, extra-marital, depression, suicide.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.891
The child said there was a stranger
in the house last night.

25:03.040 --> 25:07.523
A stranger who called himself Peter.
Roses life is at risk and it's my fault.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.051
I'll ask Eastwood to keep you briefed
on any developments.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.283
Gibson.

25:15.440 --> 25:19.490
<i>Ma 'am, it's Larkin. We found a receipt
for the shears amongst Annie's papers.</i>

25:19.640 --> 25:21.483
<i>I've obtained a duplicate set.</i>

25:21.640 --> 25:23.881
I'll meet you at the mortuary.

25:24.800 --> 25:28.361
I've read the case notes
and I know the background.

25:28.520 --> 25:32.605
And, in truth, a female therapist
would have been a better option,

25:32.760 --> 25:34.603
but I don't believe one was available.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.048
And, honestly,
there's no-one better qualified than me.

25:38.920 --> 25:43.084
Now, its possible that your daughter
may react unfavourably to my presence.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.609
A male of a certain age...
it could trigger an emotional reaction.

25:47.760 --> 25:51.003
So if you would stay close by, at first at least.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.730
Annie?

26:10.880 --> 26:12.245
Yes.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.402
I'm Paul Spector.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.287
Can I come in?

26:18.200 --> 26:20.248
Of course.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.802
Won't be a minute.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.169
<i>I feel so guilty.</i>

26:44.320 --> 26:46.322
Tell me why.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.282
It's not just guilt.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.528
It's shame.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.806
What have you got to be ashamed of?

27:00.400 --> 27:02.641
I subscribed to a website.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.847
I created a profile.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.128
What sort of website?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.602
An adult website.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.322
I just keep thinking, you know...

27:20.280 --> 27:22.886
...what if he saw me on there? What if...

27:23.840 --> 27:26.571
What if he chose me because of that site?

27:28.200 --> 27:30.601
Did you post pictures of yourself?

27:32.720 --> 27:34.722
A couple.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.211
Nothing very revealing.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.370
OK.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.442
Also, um...

27:49.280 --> 27:50.770
...a video.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.082
What kind of video?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.684
Suggesting...

27:59.120 --> 28:01.805
Suggesting that I might be up for bondage-.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.161
Domination. That type of thing.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.603
I said I had a high...

28:10.760 --> 28:12.842
high threshold for pain.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.241
I actually said that but...

28:17.040 --> 28:19.088
...I didn't know, it was just...

28:20.920 --> 28:24.686
It was just...a fantasy...a game.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.320
There's a world of difference, Annie,

28:31.480 --> 28:35.280
between what consenting adults
choose to do in their bedroom...

28:35.440 --> 28:38.284
and the violent sexual assault that you suffered.

28:39.280 --> 28:43.251
Nothing you did...
Frankly, nothing you could ever do...

28:43.400 --> 28:47.121
would ever make you responsible
for the events of that night.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.170
It's down to him...

28:50.920 --> 28:52.729
“and him alone.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.491
When did you last see Rose?

28:58.200 --> 29:02.205
I bumped into her at the market on Sunday.
We had coffee.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.800
Is it.-.out of character..-...

29:10.240 --> 29:12.242
...for her to take off?

29:14.160 --> 29:17.607
Do you think that's what happened?
She just took off?

29:18.600 --> 29:20.090
Mm, possible.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.044
It's also possible that this could all be our fault.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.843
Why do you say that?

29:28.000 --> 29:31.641
Hasn't it occurred to you
that she might have been taken, by him?

29:33.560 --> 29:35.449
Why would he do that?

29:35.600 --> 29:37.807
I don't know, To silence her?

29:40.080 --> 29:42.242
What if we've exposed her
to danger from that man

29:42.400 --> 29:44.801
by getting her to talk to you about the past?

29:49.560 --> 29:51.210
<i>Are you keeping a journal?</i>

29:52.040 --> 29:53.530
Oh...

29:54.480 --> 29:56.164
It's my diary from before.

30:00.040 --> 30:04.090
The idea is it's supposed to help me
remember more about what happened to me.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.928
And has it helped?

30:11.560 --> 30:13.688
I've not read it yet.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.642
Well, maybe it will help.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.162
Or maybe it won't.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.206
We all know people
who live too much in the past.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.124
Too much history, too much remembering,

30:31.280 --> 30:33.362
can ultimately destroy the present...

30:34.240 --> 30:36.561
...and the future.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.682
Thanks.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.127
It's been really useful.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.884
Good.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.128
It's getting too long.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.044
It's annoying me.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.681
Use that hair band to put it back.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.322
This is for something else.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.369
A friend gave it to me.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.403
A friend?

31:09.640 --> 31:11.051
Yeah.

31:13.720 --> 31:16.724
I can arrange for a hairdresser to visit, if you like.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.928
- Really?
- Of course.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.807
Well, then...

31:25.960 --> 31:28.088
yes, please.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.001
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.

31:52.720 --> 31:55.485
<i>You have one new message.</i>

31:56.280 --> 32:00.251
<i>I 'm at the school gates to pick up
Liam and Olivia, but Olivia isn't here.</i>

32:00.400 --> 32:02.402
<i>Why is your phone always...?</i>

32:07.360 --> 32:09.169
- Hello.
- Sally, it's me' What's going on?

32:09.320 --> 32:11.482
<i>- I'm calling the police.
- Why?</i>

32:11.640 --> 32:14.211
<i>- Olivia's been taken.</i>
- What do you mean, "taken"?

32:14.360 --> 32:17.011
<i>Your fucking little tramp of a girlfriend.</i>

32:17.160 --> 32:18.605
- What?
- Katie.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.161
<i>She told Miss Selmer
that I asked her to pick up Livvy.</i>

32:21.320 --> 32:23.891
<i>Pick up Livvy and leave Liam to wait for me?</i>

32:24.040 --> 32:26.611
<i>- I'm calling the police.</i>
- Don't do that.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.125
I'll deal with it.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.851
<i>How the hell can you do that?
You're in Scotland.</i>

32:31.000 --> 32:33.401
Actually, I'm not. I'm here.
I'm in Belfast.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.642
<i>What? Men did that happen?</i>

32:36.600 --> 32:39.444
Now. Today. I'm back.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.125
- I've got her number.
<i>- I bet you have.</i>

32:44.880 --> 32:47.087
I'll call her. Just wait.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.130
These are the same size, make and brand

33:10.280 --> 33:12.931
as the pair that we pulled from the water.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.087
The direction of force

33:19.240 --> 33:22.608
is more or less
at a perpendicular angle to the skin.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.490
And here...we have abrasions

33:26.640 --> 33:29.803
that look like they've been caused
by the handle of the weapon.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.405
A kind of hilt-mam injury.

33:31.560 --> 33:35.246
You said that the maximal depth of the wounds
was nine inches,

33:35.400 --> 33:36.765
but these...

33:36.920 --> 33:39.764
scissors have blades
that are under seven inches.

33:39.920 --> 33:44.130
Yeah. Because oi the compression
oi the body with force...

33:44.800 --> 33:48.771
...the depth measurement
can be greater than the length of the blade.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.567
There's nothing to indicate
that these aren't the murder weapon.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.725
<i>- Have you found them?</i>
- Not yet.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.531
<i>- Paul...</i>
- Wait just a little longer.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.842
I'll call you as soon as I do.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.610
<i>You have a funny name.</i>

34:38.600 --> 34:39.965
Katrina?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.964
No. Like my name's Spector.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.282
Oh, Benedetto.

34:46.159 --> 34:49.402
- It's Italian.
- Did you get teased at school?

34:50.440 --> 34:52.123
A bit.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.643
Is this it?

34:54.800 --> 34:57.451
- Is this really your favourite place?
- Yeah.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.847
Do you remember that necklace you had?
The one with the beetle on it.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.729
Daddy gave it to me.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.841
- Where did he get it?
- I don't know.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.367
It was a present for trying hard at school.

35:33.080 --> 35:36.163
- Do you still have it?
- I lost it.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.721
- How?
- It disappeared.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.164
When?

35:42.520 --> 35:44.568
I don't know.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.169
Daddy!

36:06.200 --> 36:07.611
Hey.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.966
- When did you get back?
- Today.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.882
It's getting late.
We need to get you home.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.002
Wait for me there.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.400
- Say goodbye to Katie.
- Bye, Katie.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.609
Hello.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.569
- Straight upstairs, please.
- But I want to be with Daddy.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.087
It's late. Upstairs and into your pyjamas now.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.811
- I'm hungry.
- Upstairs.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.486
- Where were they?
- In the park.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.687
- When did you get back?
- Just this afternoon.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.165
What is wrong with that girl?
Why does she want to hurt me?

37:31.320 --> 37:33.846
It's not you she wants to hurt. It's me.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.321
Daddy! Are you coming?

37:36.480 --> 37:38.767
The things she said to you, they're...

37:38.920 --> 37:40.922
they're teenage fantasies.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.162
There was no attack, no near rape or whatever.

37:45.880 --> 37:49.327
Olivia saw you.
She got out of bed and she saw you.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.845
What did she see?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.002
You and Katie on the floor.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.088
That was probably one of her dreams.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.605
Jesus.

37:58.760 --> 38:02.651
We can ask her about it together.
Now or in the morning, Talk to her about it.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.007
Ask her?

38:05.160 --> 38:08.448
- You have no idea, do you? Ask her?
- Sally...

38:08.600 --> 38:11.001
Anyway, you won’t be here in the morning.

38:11.800 --> 38:14.610
I want you gone and out of this house now.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.803
And what'll I say to Olivia?

38:17.960 --> 38:20.201
You'll think of something.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.849
Did you have fun with Katie?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.650
It was OK.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.280
- What did you talk about?
- School and stuff.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.602
- She asks a lot of questions, doesn't she?
- Quite a lot.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.886
- What did she ask you?
- About Scotland.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.330
What else?

38:52.480 --> 38:55.086
My necklace. The one that got lost.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.011
- I have to go, darling.
- Why?

39:11.160 --> 39:12.730
I have things to do.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.042
When will I see you again?

39:58.160 --> 40:02.245
<i>♪ The stars in your eyes bum and shine</i>

40:02.400 --> 40:06.086
<i>♪ The curve of your lips as they meet mine</i>

40:06.800 --> 40:09.167
<i>♪ Break every rule for you</i>

40:09.320 --> 40:13.689
<i>♪ And I'd dance to the blues
like a crazy fool</i>

40:15.120 --> 40:18.727
<i>♪ If you were mine, if you were mine...</i>

40:18.880 --> 40:21.451
- Sally.
<i>♪ If you were mine...</i>

40:28.720 --> 40:30.643
I don't think I can have this baby.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.646
What?

40:33.360 --> 40:35.249
How can I?

40:37.240 --> 40:38.810
Don't sit down.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.247
What do you mean, you can't have the baby?

40:49.240 --> 40:52.130
- What do you think I mean?
- Sally, you cant do that.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.165
Why not?

40:54.320 --> 40:57.005
- You're a neonatal nurse.
- We're not Catholic.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.208
My mother was Catholic.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.565
What - the woman that killed herself?

41:02.720 --> 41:04.210
Abandoned you?

41:11.800 --> 41:13.484
The police were here earlier.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.689
What do you mean?

41:16.840 --> 41:21.084
Knocking on all the doors,
talking to all the men in the neighbourhood.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.802
What did you say?

41:24.560 --> 41:26.961
I told them you were in Scotland.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.290
Is that all?

41:30.760 --> 41:33.809
I wanted to tell them that I'd lied for you.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.689
But you didn't?

41:39.160 --> 41:41.162
I tried.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.287
I tried really hard in Scotland.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.885
I know.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.486
You were cold, distant...

41:49.640 --> 41:52.849
I was ill. I had food poisoning or something.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.446
You made no effort, Paul.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.725
You held me down on the floor.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.410
“If you were mine."

42:53.840 --> 42:56.446
<i>This morning,
a spokesperson for the City Hospital</i>

42:56.600 --> 43:00.844
<i>said Mr Monroe, who is in intensive care,
remains in critical condition.</i>

43:01.000 --> 43:02.604
<i>The hunt for the Belfast Strangler,</i>

43:02.760 --> 43:06.526
<i>one of whose victims was the daughter-in-law
of Morgan Monroe, continues.</i>

43:40.320 --> 43:43.324
Do you read this in Italian, or the translation?

43:44.680 --> 43:47.160
"Midway upon the journey of our life

43:47.320 --> 43:49.607
I found myself within a forest dark.

43:49.760 --> 43:52.730
For the straightforward pathway had been lost...”

43:56.120 --> 43:58.691
I warned you once before
about fucking up my family.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.161
- This is your last warning.
- Why?

44:01.840 --> 44:03.330
What are you gonna do to me?

44:08.120 --> 44:10.122
Good. Do it.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.250
Do it.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.843
Kill me.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.004
This is all bullshit.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.049
You don't think I'm a killer.
You wouldn't be here.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.565
Fuck, you hurl me.

44:38.720 --> 44:42.645
That's nothing compared to what I'm gonna do
to you if you don't stop playing your games.

44:42.800 --> 44:45.804
- I'm not playing games.
- Dancing in from of me.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.645
Writing songs about me.
Stripping on the stairs.

44:48.800 --> 44:51.724
You're playing games.
Stupid, childish games.

44:52.480 --> 44:54.050
Don't call me a child again.

44:54.200 --> 44:55.645
You're 15 years old.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.609
I'm 16 now.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.969
- Still a child.
- I'm not a child!

45:01.120 --> 45:03.009
Don't shout.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.491
You're a liar.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.886
You told me
you couldn't trust yourself round me.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.530
You said I was beautiful.

45:12.560 --> 45:14.767
I was fucking with your head.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.282
You pig. I fucking hate you.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.207
Then stay out of my life.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.328
How can I, with all that I know about you?

45:25.160 --> 45:26.730
You know nothing about me.

45:26.880 --> 45:31.204
You're a suburban schoolgirl
with a load of sensational fantasies in her head.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.362
I'm much more than that.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.043
No.

45:36.200 --> 45:39.409
You're a little virgin,
dreaming of her first fuck.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.444
OK'

45:43.600 --> 45:45.489
If that's what you want.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.282
What are you doing?

46:39.960 --> 46:41.121
Paul?

47:55.080 --> 47:57.128
What are you doing?

48:00.920 --> 48:02.524
Consider it a test.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.805
What?

48:07.200 --> 48:10.522
Your bonds aren't tight
and your wrists are small.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.491
You should be able to get out easily enough.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.363
While you struggle...

48:19.960 --> 48:23.169
“why don't you have a think about
what you wanna do next?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.241
As Camus says...

48:26.400 --> 48:28.767
"Life is the sum of all your choices."

48:30.000 --> 48:32.606
Choose your next move carefully, Katie.

48:34.880 --> 48:37.201
Gibson.

48:37.360 --> 48:39.408
<i>- It's Larkin, ma'am.</i>
- Yes?

48:39.560 --> 48:42.370
<i>We've heard from the Recording Officer
at the labs.</i>

48:42.520 --> 48:45.285
<i>They've managed to lift a partial print
from the scissors.</i>

48:45.440 --> 48:47.886
<i>We We run it through the system
and found a match.</i>

48:48.040 --> 48:49.530
Hang on.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.922
- Go ahead.
<i>- Paul Spector.</i>

49:03.840 --> 49:05.490
How are you spelling that surname?

49:05.640 --> 49:09.122
S-P-E-C-T-O-R.

49:10.640 --> 49:12.165
Spector.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.129
Paul Spector.

49:30.280 --> 49:33.363
Apparently we talked to him
in connection with the Sarah Kay murder.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.010
Yeah.

49:38.760 --> 49:42.048
Identified himself in the CCTV footage
in the Botanic Gardens.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.690
Came in voluntarily.

49:44.760 --> 49:47.081
I want every detail on that interview.
Was it taped?

49:47.240 --> 49:50.289
- Yes, ma'am.
- Find the audio tapes. I want to hear them.

50:15.880 --> 50:18.645
<i>Where were you last night, Mr Spector?</i>

50:18.800 --> 50:21.167
<i>Last night? Why?</i>

50:22.080 --> 50:25.243
<i>- What happened last night?
- Just answer the question.</i>

50:26.720 --> 50:31.203
<i>- My wife was working at the Neonatal Unit.
- And you?</i>

50:31.880 --> 50:35.851
<i>- I was with the children.
- All evening and all night?</i>

50:36.440 --> 50:39.922
<i>Fed them, bathed them, put them to bed.</i>

50:40.680 --> 50:42.569
<i>Had an early night myself.</i>

50:44.240 --> 50:46.242
I know his face.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.242
I've seen him.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.802
Here.

50:55.240 --> 51:00.280
I was waiting...for the Kays -
we were going to a press conference - and...

51:01.080 --> 51:05.165
<i>...he was walking down the corridor,
on his own, straight towards me.</i>

51:09.040 --> 51:11.247
<i>How can than be?</i>

51:57.040 --> 52:00.044
Spector was asked
to account for his whereabouts

52:00.200 --> 52:04.762
on the nights that the attacks took place,
but not on any other nights,

52:04.920 --> 52:06.649
to see whether his recall was as good.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.724
He came in voluntarily.
Why would he do that if he's the killer?

52:09.880 --> 52:13.680
For the thrill?
To parade himself under our noses?

52:13.840 --> 52:15.205
To make us look stupid?

52:15.360 --> 52:18.887
To demonstrate his superiority
and utter contempt for us?

52:19.040 --> 52:21.407
Do I have to go on?

52:22.880 --> 52:25.087
Did you interview his wife?

52:25.960 --> 52:28.691
- Mm.
- Did you check those alibis face to face?

52:31.200 --> 52:33.089
No, ma'am, On the phone.

52:34.840 --> 52:36.285
He seemed like a good guy.

52:36.440 --> 52:38.568
And bright. Likable, helpful.

52:38.720 --> 52:41.246
He let us take his prints, his DNA.

52:42.160 --> 52:44.686
It didn't seem as though
he had anything to hide.

52:44.840 --> 52:47.446
A married man, a father of two,
a bereavement counsellor.

52:47.600 --> 52:52.208
Jesus, Glen, what have I been saying
about such individuals since day one?

52:52.360 --> 52:56.331
They frequently appear to be charming,

52:56.480 --> 52:58.528
intelligent, charismatic.

52:58.680 --> 53:00.364
The key word is "appear".

53:00.520 --> 53:04.047
They have to be probed,
wrong-footed, challenged.

53:04.200 --> 53:08.649
And why has nobody followed up
with the list of children's homes that he gave?

53:08.800 --> 53:10.689
I need a word.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.290
In private.

54:10.040 --> 54:14.364
As SIO, you have to sign off every action.
You know that.

54:14.520 --> 54:17.569
Now, if you weren't happy,
you should have raised another action

54:17.720 --> 54:19.768
to have further inquiries made.

54:22.880 --> 54:25.008
Call morning prayers for 7am.

54:25.760 --> 54:27.649
I will need to brief the chief at nine.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.169
Ma'am. Excuse me.

54:34.320 --> 54:38.006
There's been a call on your old private number.
It rang twice then rang off.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.606
The call was made from
Rose Stagqs mobile phone.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.650
Well?

55:13.080 --> 55:15.651
- Ii was amazing.
- Tell me everything.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.007
It's Rose Stagg's number, ma'am.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.890
Gibson.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.085
<i>Stella?</i>

56:08.920 --> 56:10.524
Yes.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.647
<i>How nice to hear your voice again.</i>

56:15.960 --> 56:17.644
ls that you, Peter?

56:18.320 --> 56:19.810
Yes.

56:20.600 --> 56:22.602
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

56:24.080 --> 56:26.481
Because I'm looking up at the sky...

56:27.280 --> 56:30.250
"Stella, shining star.

56:32.480 --> 56:34.050
It's a beautiful night.

56:34.200 --> 56:36.202
It made me think of you.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.121
<i>What have you done with Rose?</i>

56:42.240 --> 56:43.526
Who?

56:43.680 --> 56:45.887
Rose Stagg.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.722
Rose McGill.

56:52.600 --> 56:57.128
You must want me to know that you have her,
or why would you be using her phone?

56:59.640 --> 57:03.611
You wrote that you feel protective
towards children.

57:05.880 --> 57:07.484
Rose has two.

57:07.640 --> 57:10.564
<i>A boy of 15 months and a girl of six.</i>

57:12.520 --> 57:15.251
<i>Her daughter, particularly, is missing her.</i>

57:20.320 --> 57:22.322
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

57:23.320 --> 57:28.645
Stella, I don't know what's gonna happen to me,
to you, to anyone else in this world.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.610
All I know is...

57:33.520 --> 57:35.727
<i>..no-one can outwit death.</i>

57:40.480 --> 57:42.482
Peter?

57:45.360 --> 57:46.850
Peter?

58:19.640 --> 58:29.640
