WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:05.636
(Meredith) WE BEGIN LIFE
WITH FEW OBLIGATIONS.

00:05.636 --> 00:07.308
(man) GOOD MORNING, SEATTLE.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.380
WELCOME TO THIS FINE MORNING
FULL OF SUNSHINE--

00:09.380 --> 00:11.382
(Meredith) WE PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE
TO THE FLAG.

00:11.382 --> 00:15.116
WE SWEAR TO RETURN
OUR LIBRARY BOOKS.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.388
BUT AS WE GET OLDER,
WE TAKE VOWS,

00:17.388 --> 00:19.150
WE MAKE PROMISES,

00:19.150 --> 00:21.492
WE GET BURDENED
BY COMMITMENTS--

00:21.492 --> 00:25.025
TO DO NO HARM, TO TELL
THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT,

00:25.025 --> 00:29.200
TO LOVE AND CHERISH
TILL DEATH DO US PART.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.602
SO WE JUST KEEP
RUNNING UP A TAB

00:31.602 --> 00:34.535
UNTIL WE OWE EVERYTHING
TO EVERYBODY,

00:34.535 --> 00:37.808
AND SUDDENLY THINK,
WHAT THE...

00:37.808 --> 00:40.641
AAH!
(growls)

00:40.641 --> 00:43.144
AAH!
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS A BEAR
AND NOT A DEER?

00:43.144 --> 00:45.646
THERE ARE A LOT OF DEER
IN THOSE WOODS,

00:45.646 --> 00:48.649
AND THE BUCKS CAN GET
PRETTY BIG.
I THINK I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A BEAR AND A DEER.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.652
REST, ICE AND ELEVATE,
OKAY?
YOU KNOW HOW--YOU KNOW
HOW I GOT TO THE CAR?

00:51.652 --> 00:54.655
I HAD TO THROW A RAW STEAK
AND RUN FOR MY LIFE.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.657
THAT WAS A 10-OUNCE FILET.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.659
I'VE BEEN MARINATING IT
FOR THREE DAYS.

00:58.659 --> 01:02.363
WE HAVE TO MOVE!
WHERE? WE BARELY MAKE
30 GRAND A YEAR.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.136
AND WHO KNOWS IF WE'RE EVEN
GONNA HAVE A JOB

01:05.136 --> 01:07.268
AFTER THE MERGER?
WE COULD MOVE
BACK TO MEREDITH'S.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.240
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT?
WHY NOT?!

01:09.240 --> 01:12.773
BECAUSE WE'RE MARRIED NOW. THIS
IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE--

01:12.773 --> 01:15.776
YOU AND ME OUT IN THE WORLD,
MAKING A LIFE FOR OURSELVES.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.809
BESIDES, DON'T YOU JUST ENJOY
WAKING UP TO THE FRESH AIR

01:18.809 --> 01:21.582
AND THE SOUNDS
OF BIRDS CHIRPING?
YOU KNOW WHAT I ENJOY?

01:21.582 --> 01:25.216
I ENJOY PLUMBING.
I ENJOY PLUMBING SO MUCH!

01:27.288 --> 01:30.291
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T
LOVE IT AT MER'S. I DO.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.294
IT'S JUST... I JUST--
I CAN'T MOVE BACKWARDS, ALEX.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.526
NOT AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S...

01:37.398 --> 01:39.800
I JUST NEED
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.802
OKAY?

01:41.802 --> 01:43.634
THANK YOU.

01:43.634 --> 01:46.137
I KNOW IT HASN'T EXACTLY
BEEN EASY AROUND HERE

01:46.137 --> 01:47.808
THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.840
AND I KNOW YOU WANT ANSWERS.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.112
BUT I'M AFRAID
I DON'T HAVE THEM,

01:52.112 --> 01:56.147
NOT JUST YET...
HE BROUGHT US DOWN HERE
TO MAKE HIMSELF FEEL GOOD.

01:56.147 --> 01:59.720
WELL, AT LEAST HE SPRUNG
FOR GOOD DANISH.
YOU KNOW HOW MANY NURSES
GOT FIRED FOR THAT DANISH?

01:59.720 --> 02:02.723
THE MERCY WEST STAFF
WILL BE ARRIVING IN THREE DAYS,

02:02.723 --> 02:04.395
AND WHEN THEY DO,

02:04.395 --> 02:06.697
THERE WILL BE MORE CUTBACKS
AND MORE LAYOFFS.

02:06.697 --> 02:08.829
AND I NEED
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

02:08.829 --> 02:10.831
TO STEP UP AND BE LEADERS.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.304
AND WHEN I CAN ANSWER
YOUR QUESTIONS, I WILL.

02:13.304 --> 02:16.837
(doctors talking at once)
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

02:16.837 --> 02:19.340
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS--
(Nelson) IS MY HYPERBARIC LAB
GETTING SHUT DOWN?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.512
WHAT ABOUT MY BURN CENTER?

02:21.512 --> 02:22.913
(doctors all talking at once)

02:22.913 --> 02:26.347
YOU WERE RIGHT.
EXCELLENT DANISH.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.850
(woman) WHAT ABOUT THE STRAIN
ON RADIOLOGY?
(Nelson) WHAT ABOUT
THE ROBOTICS DEPARTMENT?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.522
ANYTHING?

02:31.522 --> 02:34.485
NOPE. THERE WAS A PAPILLARY
MUSCLE RUPTURE IN THE C.C.U.,

02:34.485 --> 02:37.358
BUT THE GUY DIED BEFORE THEY
COULD GET HIM INTO THE O.R.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.360
CRAP. I NEED SURGERIES,
AND I NEED THEM NOW.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.363
I MEAN, I BARELY HAD A HUNDRED
HOURS IN THE O.R. THIS MONTH.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.365
AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
KEEP THE RESIDENTS

02:44.365 --> 02:46.267
WITH THE MOST HOURS.

02:47.798 --> 02:51.242
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
UM, DIABETIC ULCER.

02:51.242 --> 02:52.903
DOWN TO THE BONE?

02:52.903 --> 02:54.705
I'M DONE.

02:54.705 --> 02:57.177
FINISHED. EXPIRED MEAT.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.411
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT
A LITTLE BIT.
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

03:00.411 --> 03:02.913
KICKED OFF
OF TWO SERVICES IN ONE MONTH.

03:02.913 --> 03:06.457
I COULDN'T GET INTO AN O.R.
IF I WAS BLEEDING HALF TO DEATH.

03:06.457 --> 03:09.720
YOU GOT ANYTHING GOOD?
I'M SCRUBBING IN
ON AN OPTIC GLIOMA

03:09.720 --> 03:12.223
LATER ON WITH DEREK.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.397
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.399
JUST MAKING SURE EVERYTHING
IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY HERE.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.232
AND... IT IS.

03:21.232 --> 03:22.903
KUDOS.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.906
OH, NO, NO, NO. UNH-UNH.
NO. I AM ON HUNT'S SERVICE.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.909
ANYTHING THAT TURNS SURGICAL
DOWN HERE IS MINE.
YOU DON'T NEED THE HOURS.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.912
YOU JUST SPENT THE LAST
SIX MONTHS IN THE O.R.
UNCONSCIOUS ON A TABLE
DOES NOT COUNT.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.644
(Lexie) MEREDITH.

03:33.644 --> 03:36.287
HEY, HIS NEIGHBOR SAID THAT
HE WASN'T GETTING HIS MAIL.

03:36.287 --> 03:39.390
(slurring words) MER-MEREDITH,
OH, I HEARD YOU GOT...

03:39.390 --> 03:41.992
YOU GOT MARRIED
ON A STICKER.

03:41.992 --> 03:43.954
THAT'S GREAT.
(Cristina) YOU KNOW,
WE SHOULD GO

03:43.954 --> 03:47.758
SO YOU CAN HAVE FAMILY TIME.
NO, NO, NO. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM.

03:47.758 --> 03:50.301
DID YOU PICK HIM UP
OFF THE FLOOR OF A BAR, LEXIE?

03:50.301 --> 03:52.433
THAT MIGHT BE A CLUE.
MEREDITH, NO, I'M NOT...

03:52.433 --> 03:54.935
I HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING.
I SWEAR.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.908
(vomits)

03:57.908 --> 04:01.412
(coughs)

04:01.412 --> 04:02.713
(pants)

04:02.713 --> 04:04.775
NOW THAT COULD BE SURGICAL.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.656
OKAY, MAKE SURE HIS FLUIDS
ARE RUNNING WIDE OPEN.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.957
LET'S GET THAT BLOOD HUNG.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.659
GOT F.F.P. HERE.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.031
WHAT--
WHAT ABOUT FACTOR VII?

04:21.031 --> 04:22.993
DID YOU CHECK HIS I.N.R.?
OKAY, HANG 50 MICS
OF OCTREOTIDE.

04:22.993 --> 04:25.566
(Izzie) GOT IT.
DR. BAILEY, SHOULDN'T WE
CHECK FOR RENAL FAILURE?

04:25.566 --> 04:28.699
MOVE. I NEED TO LAVAGE HIM.
NO, I NEED TO PUT THIS UP.

04:28.699 --> 04:31.742
OKAY, HEY, PAUSE. THERE'S
WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE.

04:31.742 --> 04:34.975
KAREV, GET THE OROGASTRIC
TUBE IN. THE REST OF YOU, OUT.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.678
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M IN EMERGENCY!
BUT I WAS HERE FIRST.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.979
THIS IS EMERGENT.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.412
HE MADE AMENDS.
HE'S NOT DRUNK.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.586
(sighs)

04:45.586 --> 04:47.057
(whirring)

04:47.057 --> 04:49.019
ALL RIGHT, IRVING,
I'M TAKING OFF THE GROWTH.

04:49.019 --> 04:51.021
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU FEEL ANY PAIN.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.023
HE GETS SO MANY OF THESE.

04:53.023 --> 04:55.696
WE SHOULD HAVE
THE NURSING HOME EXAMINE HIM

04:55.696 --> 04:58.068
WHEN THEY BATHE HIM.
I BATHE MYSELF.

04:58.068 --> 05:01.932
OF COURSE YOU DO, IRVING.
HE COULD FALL IN THE TUB.

05:01.932 --> 05:04.475
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
GO GET ME A CUP OF COFFEE?

05:04.475 --> 05:06.477
YOU ALREADY HAD A CUP, DAD.

05:06.477 --> 05:08.479
TOO MUCH ISN'T GOOD
FOR YOUR TICKER.

05:08.479 --> 05:10.981
WELL, HE CAN HAVE
DECAF, TOMMY.

05:10.981 --> 05:13.784
WE'LL GO GET YOU
A NICE CUP OF DECAF.

05:13.784 --> 05:16.046
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

05:16.046 --> 05:18.719
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT DEMENTED.
I'M JUST OLD.

05:21.552 --> 05:24.094
(sighs)
ALL RIGHT, UH, MR. WALLER.
ALL DONE.

05:24.094 --> 05:26.597
ALL DONE.
THERE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE REDNESS,

05:26.597 --> 05:28.599
BUT IT SHOULD HEAL UP NICELY.

05:28.599 --> 05:30.100
GOT IT?

05:30.100 --> 05:32.903
I'VE HAD THESE SKIN THINGS
FOR 30 YEARS. I'M NOT WORRIED.

05:32.903 --> 05:38.569
WHAT I'M REALLY HERE FOR
IS AN A-M-S 700.

05:38.569 --> 05:41.341
THE, UH, PENILE IMPLANT?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.814
YEAH.
WELL, USUALLY THE FIRST STEP

05:43.814 --> 05:45.816
IN TREATING ERECTILE
DYSFUNCTION'S DRUG THERAPY.

05:45.816 --> 05:47.117
I CAN, UH,

05:47.117 --> 05:49.119
IF YOU'RE HAVING SYMPTOMS,
WRITE YOU A PRESCRIPTION.

05:49.119 --> 05:52.753
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I TOOK THOSE PILLS YEARS AGO.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.755
THEY NEVER EVEN GAVE ME
A LIFTOFF.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.458
AND THEN MY WIFE DIED,
AND I GAVE UP.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.731
BUT... I'M SEEING
THIS NEW GAL

06:00.731 --> 06:02.533
FROM THE EAST WING.

06:02.533 --> 06:05.496
UH, SHE'S A YOUNGER WOMAN,
AND...

06:05.496 --> 06:07.898
I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.572
I UNDERSTAND.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.644
BUT IT IS
A SURGICAL PROCEDURE,

06:13.644 --> 06:17.147
SO... THERE IS A QUESTION
OF SAFETY, GIVEN YOUR AGE.

06:17.147 --> 06:19.009
MY AGE.

06:19.009 --> 06:22.513
IT'S ALWAYS MY AGE.

06:22.513 --> 06:24.515
AH. THE GOLDEN YEARS.

06:24.515 --> 06:27.518
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
THE GOLDEN YEARS, DOC.

06:27.518 --> 06:30.020
THERE'S JUST GOTTA BE
MORE TO LIFE

06:30.020 --> 06:34.094
THAN EATING PUDDING
AND WATCHING "CSI."

06:34.094 --> 06:36.066
NOW COME ON.

06:36.066 --> 06:38.699
CAN YOU GIVE AN OLD MAN
A WORKING JOHNSON?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.971
(chuckles)

06:45.035 --> 06:47.708
DID I TELL YOU
HOW GREAT YOUR HAIR LOOKS?

06:47.708 --> 06:51.181
IT'S ALL JUST SHORT
AND, UM, EDGY.

06:51.181 --> 06:53.944
WOW, YOU ARE
REALLY TWEAKING OUT.

06:53.944 --> 06:57.017
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU'VE CUT?
OVER A WEEK.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.920
OOH.
STEVENS, I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.622
WELL, I'M INTERESTED.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.624
UH, AN M.V.C. CAME IN
A WHILE BACK.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.627
DURING HIS WORKUP, I FOUND
AN ABDOMINAL SARCOMA.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.629
SINCE THEN, I'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING HIS RECURRENCES,

07:08.629 --> 07:10.961
AND, UH, HE CAME BACK TODAY
WITH HIS THIRD ONE.

07:10.961 --> 07:14.064
WONDERED IF YOU COULD SCRUB IN
IF YOU FEEL READY.
I'M READY.

07:14.064 --> 07:17.207
I'M READY.
HE'S IN PRE-OP.

07:18.969 --> 07:20.971
YOU KNOW
I NEED A SURGERY.

07:20.971 --> 07:23.113
AND YOU KNOW
I DON'T PLAY FAVORITES.

07:23.113 --> 07:25.746
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFRAID
TO WORK WITH STEVENS.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.749
IT'S LIKE SHE'S GONNA BREAK
OR SOMETHING. IT'S NOT RIGHT.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.752
SHE IS A GOOD SURGEON
AND SHE HAS A WAY WITH PATIENTS

07:31.752 --> 07:33.924
AND A LIGHT TOUCH.
YOU WANT NICE?

07:33.924 --> 07:35.926
I CAN BE NICE
TO A DYING HUSK.

07:35.926 --> 07:39.790
YEAH.
N-NOT A LIGHT TOUCH.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.062
MY DAD'S DEAD. AT FIRST
I THOUGHT HE WAS DRUNK,

07:42.062 --> 07:44.134
THEN HE STARTED
PUKING BLOOD.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.066
AND PUKING BLOOD
AND DISORIENTATION

07:46.066 --> 07:49.069
USUALLY MEANS...
END-STAGE LIVER FAILURE.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.071
WHICH MEANS
HE'S PROBABLY DEAD BY NOW

07:51.071 --> 07:53.974
OR HE NEEDS A TRANSPLANT,
AND I HOPE HE'S NOT A CANDIDATE,

07:53.974 --> 07:56.977
BECAUSE THAT MEANS HE'D BE
IN THE HOSPITAL FOR MONTHS.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.679
UH, MER.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.552
HE NEEDS A TRANSPLANT,
DOESN'T HE?

08:01.552 --> 08:02.983
(Alex) YEAH.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.965
YOU'VE GOT END-STAGE
CIRRHOSIS.

08:14.965 --> 08:17.898
WE CAN TREAT THE SYMPTOMS,
BUT THE ONLY THING

08:17.898 --> 08:21.001
THAT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE
IS A TRANSPLANT.
HOW DID IT HAPPEN THIS FAST?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.173
HE BATHED IT IN GIN.

08:23.173 --> 08:25.876
(Lexie) ALEX.
(Thatcher) NO,
YOUR FRIEND'S RIGHT.

08:25.876 --> 08:29.179
EXCEPT FOR THE GIN.
I WAS A SCOTCH MAN.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.742
WHAT'S--
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP HERE?

08:31.742 --> 08:34.014
DO I GET ON A LIST?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.016
UM, THATCHER,
THE TRANSPLANT BOARD

08:36.016 --> 08:37.517
HAS A RULE HERE.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.850
AN ALCOHOLIC HAS TO BE SOBER
AT LEAST A YEAR

08:39.850 --> 08:42.753
BEFORE HE QUALIFIES
FOR A DONOR LIVER.

08:42.753 --> 08:45.055
I'M ONLY 90 DAYS.

08:48.058 --> 08:50.130
I'LL DO IT.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.133
I'LL DO IT TODAY. I'LL--
I'LL GO GET TESTED RIGHT NOW.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.837
(Thatcher) LEXIE--
NO, THEY JUST TAKE A PIECE.
MY LIVER WILL REGENERATE.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.169
I CAN'T ASK YOU
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

08:59.169 --> 09:01.071
IT'S... IT'S MAJOR SURGERY.

09:01.071 --> 09:02.973
YOU'RE NOT ASKING.

09:02.973 --> 09:04.845
YOU'RE MY DAD.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.618
YOU WANT A KIDNEY? I'LL THROW IN
ONE OF THOSE, TOO.

09:07.618 --> 09:08.719
(sighs)

09:11.682 --> 09:13.684
ONE MORE TIME.
YOU BE THE CHIEF.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.686
YOU'RE ALL CRANKY
AND, UH, IN A BAD MOOD.

09:15.686 --> 09:18.689
AND I'LL BE CALLIE
ASKING FOR HER JOB BACK.
YOU ARE CALLIE.

09:18.689 --> 09:21.692
RIGHT. SO IT WORKS.
YOU SAID THAT YESTERDAY,
AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT

09:21.692 --> 09:23.664
AND THE DAY BEFORE
THE DAY BEFORE THAT.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.667
SO ARE YOU GONNA DO THIS?
HEY, IT IS NOT EASY
TO ASK FOR YOUR JOB BACK

09:26.667 --> 09:28.669
AFTER YOU TOLD YOUR BOSS
TO GO SCREW HIMSELF

09:28.669 --> 09:30.941
IN FRONT OF
HIS ENTIRE HOSPITAL.

09:30.941 --> 09:32.943
IT'S HUMILIATING.
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.

09:32.943 --> 09:34.945
WHAT--WHAT IS THE POINT?
HE ALREADY FIRED ME ONCE.

09:34.945 --> 09:37.978
HE'S NOT GONNA HIRE ME BACK NOW
JUST BECAUSE OF THE MERGER.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.050
WHATEVER. MAYBE BEING
A SURGEON'S OVERRATED.

09:40.050 --> 09:42.152
I'D BE HAPPY
DOING LOTS OF THINGS.

09:42.152 --> 09:45.085
I COULD OPEN A DAYCARE.
BABIES ARE CUTE.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.018
EW. THAT ONE JUST SPIT.
CALLIOPE TORRES,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO

09:48.018 --> 09:50.761
MOVE TO CLEVELAND
TO BE A SURGEON.
(sighs)
OKAY, I'M GONNA DO IT.

09:50.761 --> 09:52.693
(pager beeps)
OH.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.767
LATER?
BUT I-I WILL COME BACK LATER.

09:56.767 --> 09:59.930
(mutters) MY GIRLFRIEND'S
MOVING TO CLEVELAND.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.232
(babbles)
YEP. YEP.

10:02.232 --> 10:05.706
LOOK AT YOU.
COMING IN ON YOUR DAY OFF.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.708
TRYING TO GET IN
TO THE O.R.?

10:07.708 --> 10:10.040
YEAH. I'M GONNA GIVE MY DAD
A PIECE OF MY LIVER.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.342
END-STAGE LIVER DISEASE.
HE NEEDS MY LIVER.

10:12.342 --> 10:15.315
I'M GIVING HIM SOME.
GO AHEAD, STEVE.
WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.

10:15.315 --> 10:19.149
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
WELL, MY PROBLEM IS,
YOU DON'T JUST JUMP IN

10:19.149 --> 10:21.151
TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT.

10:21.151 --> 10:23.694
TAKE A COUPLE DAYS.
WE'LL--WE'LL TALK.
WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

10:23.694 --> 10:26.256
IT'S MAJOR,
LIFE-THREATENING SURGERY.
OKAY, MY DAD NEEDS
A TRANSPLANT, MARK.

10:26.256 --> 10:29.159
I GET THAT, BUT WHAT
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND--
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU GET IT AT ALL.

10:29.159 --> 10:31.962
YOU KNOW
WHAT I DON'T GET?

10:31.962 --> 10:35.105
WE'RE TOGETHER.
WE LIVE TOGETHER.

10:35.105 --> 10:37.838
WE NEED TO DECIDE
THESE THINGS TOGETHER.

10:37.838 --> 10:41.311
YOU CAN'T JUST GO UNDER
THE KNIFE AND LEAVE ME A NOTE.
NO, I-I WOULD'VE PAGED YOU.

10:41.311 --> 10:43.313
I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND, GREY.

10:43.313 --> 10:45.776
HE'S MY DAD.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.920
OKAY. A LITTLE PINCH.

10:54.955 --> 10:59.129
OH. I CANNOT GET
THIS STUPID THING TO WORK.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.391
TRY KNOCKING IT ON SOMETHING.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.264
(tv clicks on)

11:04.264 --> 11:06.196
(woman) EXCUSE ME.
INSIDER TRICK.

11:06.196 --> 11:08.198
WHAT OTHER TRICKS YOU KNOW?

11:08.198 --> 11:10.400
WELL, STAY AWAY
FROM THE LIME JELL-O.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.843
AND IF YOU WANT THE GOOD MEDS,
TELL 'EM YOU HAVE A HEADACHE,

11:12.843 --> 11:14.344
NOT A STOMACHACHE.

11:14.344 --> 11:17.307
OH, AND IF YOUR ARM STARTS TO
HURT FROM ALL THE NEEDLE POKES,

11:17.307 --> 11:19.309
TELL 'EM YOU WANT THAT
ANESTHETIC CREAM. IT NUMBS IT.

11:19.309 --> 11:21.311
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
STAGE IV MELANOMA.

11:21.311 --> 11:23.213
UM, MRS. HELSBY,

11:23.213 --> 11:25.355
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE HIM
A RECTAL EXAM.

11:25.355 --> 11:28.358
SO YOU MAY WANT TO LEAVE
THE ROOM FOR THIS.
OH, NO. I'M--
I'M NOT HIS WIFE. (laughs)

11:28.358 --> 11:31.061
WHAT'S THAT SAYING--
UH, THEY WON'T BUY THE COW

11:31.061 --> 11:33.764
IF YOU GIVE 'EM
THE MILK FOR FREE?

11:33.764 --> 11:35.926
YEAH, WE'RE WORKING ON
EIGHT YEARS OF FREE MILK.

11:35.926 --> 11:38.899
HEY, I WAS GONNA PROPOSE
LAST YEAR, BUT I GOT DISTRACTED

11:38.899 --> 11:41.902
BY THIS LITTLE THING
CALLED CANCER.
YOU GOT THE BEST EXCUSE
IN THE BOOK.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.904
(Izzie laughs) NICE.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.376
(man speaks indistinctly
on tv)

11:46.376 --> 11:48.378
THE RING'S AT HOME
IN THE MOUTH GUARD CONTAINER,

11:48.378 --> 11:50.140
ALL RIGHT?

11:50.140 --> 11:52.212
I'M JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.214
WHAT WE'D DO
IS WE'D SURGICALLY PLACE

11:54.214 --> 11:57.087
THE SILICONE IMPLANT
INTO THE PENIS,

11:57.087 --> 12:00.150
AND WHEN THE PUMP IS SQUEEZED
BEFORE INTERCOURSE--

12:00.150 --> 12:02.823
WHERE DOES THE PUMP GO?
IN THE SCROTUM.

12:02.823 --> 12:06.056
SO TO PUMP IT UP,
I JUST SQUEEZE THE JEWELS?

12:06.056 --> 12:08.759
DAD. (laughs) DAD.
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:08.759 --> 12:10.801
YOU'RE 82 YEARS OLD.

12:10.801 --> 12:13.063
SO? I SHOULDN'T HAVE
A SEX LIFE?

12:13.063 --> 12:16.136
GO ON, DOC. YOU'RE JUST
GETTING TO THE GOOD PART.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.438
NO, NO, LISTEN TO ME.
THIS IS MAJOR SURGERY.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.140
THEY HAVE TO CUT YOUR...

12:20.140 --> 12:23.213
THEY CUT YOU OPEN, DAD.
YOU COULD BLEED OR...

12:23.213 --> 12:25.846
YOU WANT TO DIE, HUH,
OVER AN ERECTION?

12:25.846 --> 12:28.849
WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT
OVER AN ERECTION, SON.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.782
(woman) IRVING, I'M--I'M SURE
THAT A-A THING LIKE THIS

12:31.782 --> 12:33.784
ISN'T COVERED BY MEDICARE.
OH, BROTHER.

12:33.784 --> 12:35.786
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO USE YOUR SAVINGS,

12:35.786 --> 12:38.789
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO HELP JANEY PAY FOR COLLEGE.

12:38.789 --> 12:40.490
SWEETHEART, I LOVE JANEY.

12:40.490 --> 12:43.493
BUT LET'S STOP PRETENDING
SHE'S GOING TO COLLEGE.

12:43.493 --> 12:45.165
SHE'S PRETTY,

12:45.165 --> 12:47.167
BUT SHE'S NOT TOO SHARP.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.200
DAD.
TOM, THIS IS MY MONEY.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.542
THIS IS THE WAY
I WANT TO SPEND IT.

12:52.542 --> 12:55.275
YOUR MOTHER AND I SAVED
OUR ENTIRE LIVES

12:55.275 --> 12:57.247
FOR WHAT SHE CALLED
"A RAINY DAY."

12:57.247 --> 13:00.180
AND THEN SHE DIED BEFORE
WE COULD SPEND ONE CENT.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.182
I THINK YOUR MOTHER
WOULD BE PROUD

13:02.182 --> 13:04.514
THAT I'M FINALLY DOING
SOMETHING NICE FOR MYSELF.

13:04.514 --> 13:08.118
YOU THINK MOM WOULD BE PROUD
YOU'RE GETTING A PENIS PUMP?
(Mark) OKAY.

13:08.118 --> 13:10.190
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RUN
SOME TESTS.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.193
WE MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW
IF THE SURGERY IS AN OPTION.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.565
SO WHY DON'T WE ALL
JUST CALM DOWN,

13:15.565 --> 13:18.128
START FROM THERE?

13:25.906 --> 13:28.278
HEY, WHATCHA LOOKIN' FOR?

13:28.278 --> 13:30.210
EXCUSE ME?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.212
OH, I-I COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE, UH,

13:32.212 --> 13:34.885
YOU HAVE NO RESIDENT ON YOUR
DECOMPRESSIVE LAMINECTOMY.

13:34.885 --> 13:38.288
WELL, TODAY'S YOUR LUCKY DAY,
'CAUSE I'M AVAILABLE.

13:38.288 --> 13:40.390
YANG, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

13:40.390 --> 13:42.552
I-I HEARD YOU WERE
HARD-CORE INTO CARDIO.

13:42.552 --> 13:45.956
I CAN BE HARD-CORE
INTO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

13:45.956 --> 13:47.227
(elevator bell dings)

13:51.231 --> 13:53.233
ARE YOU WHORING YOURSELF
OUT FOR SURGERIES?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.405
OH, SHUT UP.
YOU FORCED ME INTO IT.

13:55.405 --> 13:58.338
BIOLOGY--IT'S CRAP,
UTTER CRAP.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.111
D.N.A., R.N.A.--DOESN'T MAKE
SOMEONE YOUR FAMILY.

14:01.111 --> 14:03.273
IT DOES, ACTUALLY.

14:03.273 --> 14:05.175
HE NEEDS A LIVER TRANSPLANT.

14:05.175 --> 14:08.418
LEXIE VOLUNTEERED LIKE SHE
JUST GOT ASKED FOR A $1 BILL.

14:08.418 --> 14:11.621
I LEFT THE ROOM.
HE'S NOT MY FATHER.
WAIT, YOUR DAD
NEEDS A TRANSPLANT?

14:11.621 --> 14:15.055
(pager beeps)
OOH. MAYBE NOT.
MAYBE HE'S DEAD THIS TIME.

14:18.128 --> 14:19.629
(Owen) AH, DAMN IT.

14:19.629 --> 14:21.631
IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

14:21.631 --> 14:25.435
THE SCARRING'S COMPLETELY
FUSED HIS ORGANS TOGETHER.

14:25.435 --> 14:27.297
GOD, IT LOOKS LIKE

14:27.297 --> 14:29.900
SOMEBODY POURED
A BOTTLE OF GLUE DOWN THERE.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.242
HOW DO WE FIX IT?

14:32.242 --> 14:34.604
WE DON'T.

14:34.604 --> 14:36.606
IF WE COULD
JUST TO THE CANCER,

14:36.606 --> 14:38.608
I THINK WE COULD GET
CLEAN MARGINS.

14:38.608 --> 14:40.310
WITH THIS MANY ADHESIONS,

14:40.310 --> 14:42.352
THE RISK OF TUMOR RUPTURE--
IT'S TOO HIGH.

14:42.352 --> 14:45.455
WE CUT INTO HIM AGAIN, WE'RE
DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

14:45.455 --> 14:47.457
BUT MAYBE IF WE JUST--

14:47.457 --> 14:49.459
WE HAVE TO KNOW
WHEN TO SAY WHEN, STEVENS.

14:49.459 --> 14:52.392
AND I'M SAYING WHEN.
(instruments clatter)

14:52.392 --> 14:55.395
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

14:57.367 --> 15:00.530
IS HE DEAD?
NO.

15:00.530 --> 15:02.232
OH.

15:02.232 --> 15:06.076
WE RUSHED DR. GREY'S LABS.
SHE WASN'T A MATCH.

15:06.076 --> 15:08.608
OH. OKAY.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.281
UM... WHAT ABOUT HOLLY?

15:11.281 --> 15:14.144
YOU, UH, YOU--
MOLLY, OUR SISTER?

15:14.144 --> 15:15.515
YEAH.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.989
SHE LIVES ON AN ARMY BASE
WITH HER HUSBAND IN BAHRAIN.

15:18.989 --> 15:20.991
UM, PLUS, SHE HAS A HISTORY
OF D.V.T.,

15:20.991 --> 15:23.123
SO SHE CAN'T BE A DONOR.
OH.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.426
(Richard) MEREDITH,
WE DIDN'T CALL YOU HERE TO...

15:26.426 --> 15:28.428
W-WE THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW

15:28.428 --> 15:31.431
BEFORE WE GO IN AND TELL HIM,
JUST IN CASE.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.434
RIGHT. RIGHT. NO, THANK YOU
FOR KEEPING ME IN THE LOOP.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.707
THANK YOU. I, UM, HAVE TO GO
PREP FOR MY SURGERY NOW.

15:37.707 --> 15:39.209
OKAY.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.581
♪♪

15:51.581 --> 15:53.623
WHY ARE WE EATING LUNCH

15:53.623 --> 15:57.627
IN A ROOM
FULL OF DISEASED ORGANS?
(Meredith) WE ARE HIDING
FROM LEXIE

15:57.627 --> 15:59.629
AND HER BIG, SAD
"I LOVE MY DADDY" EYES,

15:59.629 --> 16:03.133
BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.
WAIT, IS LITTLE GREY
NOT A MATCH?

16:03.133 --> 16:05.665
OH, DAMN.
THERE GOES MY TRANSPLANT.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.338
NICE TRY.
IT WAS MY TRANSPLANT.
ARE YOU GONNA GET TESTED, MER?

16:08.338 --> 16:11.201
NO. I BARELY KNOW THE GUY.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.273
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST GET TESTED.

16:13.273 --> 16:17.207
YOU COULD REGRET IT
IF YOU DON'T DO IT.
HE MIGHT BE
A DRUNK DEADBEAT,

16:17.207 --> 16:20.350
BUT HE GAVE YOU
THE ULTIMATE GIFT.
YEAH, THE GIFT OF LIFE.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.682
(laughs) YOU GUYS ARE SICK.
YOU REALLY ARE. YOU'RE SICK.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.186
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM, MER.
THEY JUST WANT A SURGERY.
MAMA NEEDS TO CUT.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.659
BABE, YOU GOT SOME DIRT
ON YOUR NECK. RIGHT THERE.

16:29.659 --> 16:32.162
THAT'S NOT DIRT.
THAT'S A TICK. EW.

16:32.162 --> 16:36.126
GET IT--GET IT OFF ME.
OH, IS THAT A TICK?

16:36.126 --> 16:37.627
IT IS A TICK.
IT'S A TICK.

16:37.627 --> 16:40.200
LOOK AT IT.
IT'S ALL SWOLLEN.
GET IT OFF ME NOW, PLEASE.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.472
IT'S HAVING LUNCH, TOO.
GET IT OFF ME! GET IT
OFF OF ME RIGHT NOW!

16:42.472 --> 16:45.035
(Izzie and Meredith
shouting indistinctly)
GET IT! GET IT!
SOMEBODY, TAKE IT OFF!

16:45.035 --> 16:48.038
YOU KNOW, THE KIDS THINK
THIS IS ALL VANITY.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.310
BUT I REALLY NEED
THIS SURGERY, DOC.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.312
WELL, IF SHE LOVES YOU,

16:52.312 --> 16:55.245
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND
IF YOU CAN'T... PERFORM.

16:55.245 --> 16:57.317
CUDDLING'S NICE, TOO.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.349
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE JUST A KID, DOC.

16:59.349 --> 17:01.121
YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.623
BUT ONE DAY,
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP

17:03.623 --> 17:05.625
AND ALL THE BIG STUFF,

17:05.625 --> 17:08.228
ALL THE MILESTONES YOU'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO--

17:08.228 --> 17:12.432
GRADUATION, WEDDING,
HAVING KIDS, YOUR GRANDKIDS--

17:12.432 --> 17:15.335
IT'S ALL BEHIND YOU.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.138
IT'S ALL OVER.

17:18.138 --> 17:21.141
ALL YOU GOT
IS A BUNCH OF YESTERDAYS

17:21.141 --> 17:23.343
AND VERY FEW TOMORROWS.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.275
I HAVEN'T WANTED
TO MAKE LOVE WITH A WOMAN

17:25.275 --> 17:28.248
SINCE SYLVIE DIED
OVER 20 YEARS AGO.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.620
AND THEN ONE NIGHT...

17:30.620 --> 17:32.452
ONE NIGHT...

17:32.452 --> 17:35.285
THEY SAT ME DOWN
AT THE BINGO TABLE

17:35.285 --> 17:37.056
WITH MARION.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.330
AND YOU JUST KNEW.

17:40.330 --> 17:43.533
SHE'S MY TOMORROW.

17:51.801 --> 17:53.303
HE'S STILL SLEEPING.

17:53.303 --> 17:55.605
GOOD.
HE NEEDS HIS REST.

17:55.605 --> 17:57.607
DR. BAILEY, I, UM,
I-I WAS WONDERING IF--

17:57.607 --> 17:59.249
IF YOU COULD LIE,

17:59.249 --> 18:02.552
IF--IF YOU COULD LIE
TO THE TRANSPLANT BOARD

18:02.552 --> 18:05.315
AND--AND TELL THEM THAT
HE'S BEEN SOBER FOR A YEAR.

18:05.315 --> 18:07.317
UM, THEY TRUST YOU.
THEY'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

18:07.317 --> 18:10.320
AND--AND MAYBE THEN HE COULD--
HE COULD GET ON THE LIST.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.322
DR. GREY,
I HAVE 15 OTHER PATIENTS

18:12.322 --> 18:14.324
ALL WAITING
FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTS--

18:14.324 --> 18:16.626
15 PEOPLE
IN AN UNTENABLE SITUATION,

18:16.626 --> 18:19.769
NONE OF WHOM
DRANK THEMSELVES INTO IT.

18:19.769 --> 18:23.303
SO, NO, I WILL NOT LIE,
NOT FOR YOU, NOT FOR ANYONE.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.305
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

18:25.305 --> 18:27.307
I CAN ANSWER?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.212
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT--
THINGS CRAWLING ALL OVER YOU,

18:32.212 --> 18:36.216
STUPID SQUIRRELS HAVING A PARTY
ALL NIGHT ON YOUR ROOF?

18:36.216 --> 18:39.219
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY
DOING UP THERE ANYWAY?

18:39.219 --> 18:42.222
APPLYING BETADINE TO THE AREA.
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.225
I MEAN, I DON'T CAMP.
MY PARENTS WERE LOUNGE LIZARDS.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.357
I WAS RAISED IN A BAR.
EXTRACTING THE ARACHNID.

18:47.357 --> 18:50.360
AND THEN THERE'S NO PLUMBING.
I MEAN, THE--THE TOILET?

18:50.360 --> 18:53.403
IT EMPTIES INTO A BUCKET
UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER.

18:53.403 --> 18:56.406
A CRAP BUCKET! AND IZZIE'S ALL,
"MARRIAGE IS AN ADVENTURE,

18:56.406 --> 18:59.569
JUST THE TWO OF US,
EXPLORING THE WILD."

18:59.569 --> 19:02.312
I MARRIED
FREAKIN' LEWIS AND CLARK.
WELL, I GUESS I'M DONE.

19:02.312 --> 19:03.773
THAT'S IT.

19:03.773 --> 19:07.177
I MEAN, I'M--I'M TELLING HER,
WE'RE MOVING BACK TO MEREDITH'S.

19:07.177 --> 19:09.449
I'M DONE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.352
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT
HOW IT WORKS.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.225
I MEAN, SHE'S JUST
BEEN THROUGH HELL.

19:15.225 --> 19:19.359
SHE'S NOT OKAY YET.
JUST GIVE HER ONE, ALEX.
SINCE WHEN DID YOU
BECOME A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR?

19:19.359 --> 19:21.361
I GUESS WHEN YOU SAVE
SOMEONE'S LIFE,

19:21.361 --> 19:24.264
YOU KINDA WANT IT
NOT TO SUCK.

19:25.735 --> 19:28.398
YOU KNOW, I HATE WHEN
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE HERE

19:28.398 --> 19:30.400
SAY THAT SEATTLE WEATHER SUCKS.
THOSE PEOPLE SUCK.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.273
OOH. I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING. I MADE A LIST.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.276
HMM. YOU MADE A LIST?
YEAH, TO READ TO THE CHIEF.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.778
50 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD
HIRE ME AS AN ATTENDING.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.550
OKAY, NUMBER ONE,

19:40.550 --> 19:42.482
I BUILT A MAN'S BONES
OUT OF TITANIUM RODS.

19:42.482 --> 19:46.416
TWO, WHAT I LACK IN EXPERIENCE,
I MAKE UP FOR IN RAW TALENT.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.418
THREE, I CAN GO SEVEN HOURS
IN THE O.R.

19:48.418 --> 19:50.320
WITHOUT EVEN TAKING
A PEE BREAK.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.322
FOUR... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:52.322 --> 19:54.324
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

19:54.324 --> 19:55.925
UH, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.370
I LOST MY FAVORITE SCRUB NURSE
YESTERDAY.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.372
ANNE--
SHE'S A SINGLE MOTHER.

20:02.372 --> 20:05.975
SHE'S SUPPORTING THREE KIDS,
AND NOW SHE'S OUT OF A JOB.

20:05.975 --> 20:08.738
AND THIS MORNING,
A 10 MONTH OLD HEMORRHAGED

20:08.738 --> 20:10.740
WHILE I WAS DEEP IN HER CHEST,

20:10.740 --> 20:13.283
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
MY FAVORITE SCRUB NURSE.

20:13.283 --> 20:16.286
I HAD TO ACTUALLY LOOK UP
AND ASK FOR A MESH WRAP

20:16.286 --> 20:18.288
BECAUSE THE NEW NURSE
DIDN'T KNOW ME.

20:18.288 --> 20:21.291
ANNE KNEW ALL MY MOVES
BEFORE I EVEN MADE 'EM.

20:21.291 --> 20:26.396
AND IT FELT TERRIBLE TO BE
IN THE O.R. WITHOUT HER.

20:26.396 --> 20:28.398
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

20:28.398 --> 20:32.262
TO SPENDING 30 MINUTES
IN THE PARK WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

20:32.262 --> 20:36.266
'CAUSE THIS MERGER THING?
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US.

20:36.266 --> 20:39.309
SORRY.
I'VE BEEN... JUST...

20:39.309 --> 20:41.441
SORRY.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.677
HE'LL SAY YES
OR HE'LL SAY NO.

20:47.677 --> 20:49.379
(exhales deeply)

20:49.379 --> 20:51.681
AND THEN WE'LL KNOW.

20:51.681 --> 20:53.853
OKAY.

20:55.825 --> 20:59.889
(whirring)

20:59.889 --> 21:01.891
THIS OUR OPTIC GLIOMA GUY?

21:01.891 --> 21:04.964
MM-HMM. ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

21:04.964 --> 21:07.967
THERE'LL BE OTHERS.
I PROMISE.
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

21:07.967 --> 21:11.341
EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I OWE HIM SOMETHING,

21:11.341 --> 21:15.405
BUT HE'S STILL
THE BAD GUY HERE.
YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYTHING.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.278
I...

21:21.611 --> 21:24.354
SO I'M GONNA BE FIRED.

21:24.354 --> 21:26.656
I'VE DONE A LOT
OF REALLY DUMB THINGS TODAY,

21:26.656 --> 21:29.319
INCLUDING PULLING
YOUR MEDICAL FILES.

21:29.319 --> 21:30.820
LEXIE--

21:30.820 --> 21:32.992
JUST LISTEN.
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.695
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO COME TO YOU

21:35.695 --> 21:37.327
FOR ANYTHING, EVER.

21:37.327 --> 21:40.500
SO I THOUGHT IF I LOOKED UP
YOUR BLOOD TYPE

21:40.500 --> 21:43.503
AND IT WAS THE WRONG ONE,
THEN THAT WOULD BE IT,

21:43.503 --> 21:46.436
THEN I COULD
JUST STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

21:46.436 --> 21:48.678
BUT I CAN'T,

21:48.678 --> 21:50.680
BECAUSE YOU HAVE HIS BLOOD.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.343
AND I KNOW
THAT HE'S NOT YOUR DAD.

21:53.343 --> 21:55.485
I KNOW THAT HE WAS
NEVER THERE FOR YOU.

21:55.485 --> 21:58.488
AND I'M--I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU
TO GIVE HIM ANYTHING.

21:58.488 --> 22:02.392
HE DOESN'T DESERVE A THING
FROM YOU. HE DOESN'T.

22:02.392 --> 22:04.654
BUT HE'S...

22:04.654 --> 22:07.757
HE'S GONNA DIE, MEREDITH.

22:07.757 --> 22:09.759
(voice breaking)
AND SO I'M ASKING YOU

22:09.759 --> 22:11.761
TO GIVE SOMETHING TO ME.

22:11.761 --> 22:13.533
I'M ASKING...

22:13.533 --> 22:17.807
I AM ASKING YOU
TO GIVE ME MY DAD.

22:17.807 --> 22:21.611
BECAUSE AS CRAPPY
AS HE WAS TO YOU,

22:21.611 --> 22:24.974
OH, HE WAS WONDERFUL TO ME.

22:24.974 --> 22:28.117
HE NEVER MISSED
A SINGLE DANCE RECITAL.

22:28.117 --> 22:30.820
HE WAS THERE
AT MY FIFTH GRADE GRADUATION,

22:30.820 --> 22:32.121
AND WHAT IS THAT?

22:32.121 --> 22:34.384
THAT'S NOT EVEN REAL.

22:34.384 --> 22:36.386
I KNOW HE'S NOT YOUR DAD.

22:36.386 --> 22:39.389
I-I KNOW THAT.

22:39.389 --> 22:42.392
BUT SOMEHOW...

22:42.392 --> 22:46.466
YOU HAVE HIS BLOOD,
AND I DON'T.

22:46.466 --> 22:49.469
SO I'M ASKING YOU...

22:49.469 --> 22:53.443
(sobs)
GIVE ME MY DAD.

22:53.443 --> 22:56.506
(cries)

23:16.696 --> 23:20.129
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

23:20.129 --> 23:22.101
HI, MEREDITH.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.134
WE FOUND A MATCH.

23:25.134 --> 23:27.136
WHAT?

23:27.136 --> 23:29.439
WE FOUND A MATCH,
A DONOR LIVER.

23:29.439 --> 23:31.941
SO WE'RE GONNA SCHEDULE
THE SURGERY FOR TONIGHT.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.413
UH, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.546
I... BUT I THOUGHT I--
I WASN'T ELIGIBLE

23:36.546 --> 23:39.018
FOR THE...
THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.921
IT'S NOT FROM THE LIST.
IT'S ME.

23:43.853 --> 23:45.695
I GOT TESTED,

23:45.695 --> 23:47.697
AND MY CROSSMATCH
WAS NEGATIVE,

23:47.697 --> 23:49.699
WHICH MEANS
WE'RE AN IDEAL MATCH.

23:49.699 --> 23:53.432
SO I'M GONNA GO GET ADMITTED,
AND WE'LL DO THIS.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.665
(mutters) MER.

23:55.665 --> 23:59.569
I'M A DRUNK, MEREDITH.

23:59.569 --> 24:01.140
I DID THIS.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.743
I PUT MYSELF IN THIS BED.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.445
I BROKE ME.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.447
I CAN'T.

24:08.447 --> 24:12.522
I WON'T LET YOU
PUT ME BACK TOGETHER.

24:12.522 --> 24:15.224
I'VE PUT YOU THROUGH ENOUGH.

24:15.224 --> 24:18.488
IT'S A GENEROUS OFFER.
I CAN'T.

24:18.488 --> 24:21.060
I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.765
(woman) I'M SORRY,

24:25.765 --> 24:28.167
BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN DO.

24:28.167 --> 24:31.601
HE'S 31. WE JUST BOUGHT
A CONDO TOGETHER.

24:31.601 --> 24:33.673
WE JUST RESCUED A PUPPY.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.576
ANGE, ANGE,
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.579
(crying) THERE JUST
SENDING YOU HOME TO...

24:39.579 --> 24:41.611
WHAT KIND OF DOCTORS
ARE YOU?

24:41.611 --> 24:43.613
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO SOMETHING.

24:43.613 --> 24:45.615
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING
THEY CAN.

24:45.615 --> 24:48.117
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DR. HUNT'S
GIVEN US EXTRA TIME,

24:48.117 --> 24:50.189
TIME THAT WE NEVER
WOULD'VE HAD--

24:50.189 --> 24:52.722

24:57.667 --> 24:59.529
(cries)

24:59.529 --> 25:01.601
WE COULD TRY
CYTOREDUCTIVE SURGERY.
IT WON'T WORK.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.773
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE TUMOR.

25:03.773 --> 25:05.835
WITH THESE KIND OF ADHESIONS,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

25:05.835 --> 25:08.007
OKAY, THEN WHAT ABOUT
BALL-TIPPED ELECTROSURGERY?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.040
IT COULD HELP US
GET AROUND THE ADHESIONS.
HIS CANCER IS INCURABLE.
NOW I'M NOT GONNA PUT

25:11.040 --> 25:13.042
THAT MAN THROUGH ANOTHER
EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL SURGERY

25:13.042 --> 25:15.214

A SURVIVAL RATE OF 13%.
I HAD 5%.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.587
STEVENS--
I HAD A 5% CHANCE
OF SURVIVAL.

25:17.587 --> 25:20.089
I HAVE INCURABLE CANCER,
BUT I AM LIVING WITH IT.

25:20.089 --> 25:22.091
AND THE ONLY REASON I AM,
THE ONLY REASON

25:22.091 --> 25:24.754
I'M STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW IS
BECAUSE NO ONE EVER SAID TO ME,

25:24.754 --> 25:26.896
"WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING WE CAN DO."

25:26.896 --> 25:29.528
I'M ALIVE RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE PEOPLE FOUGHT FOR ME.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.030
CRISTINA FOUGHT FOR ME.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.563
HE DESERVES
THE CHANCE TO FIGHT.

25:33.563 --> 25:36.566
IF HE DOESN'T WANT IT, FINE.

MOTHER TERESA WOULD BE PROUD.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.624

25:54.624 --> 25:57.587
HE'S SICK AND YOU'RE NOT.
YOU GOTTA GO BACK IN THERE.

25:57.587 --> 26:01.190

UH, THAT MEANS
HE'S CLEARED FOR SURGERY.

WE CAN'T STOP YOU.

HAVE TALKED IT OVER.

26:59.989 --> 27:02.051
WE'VE DECIDED IF YOU DO THIS,

27:02.051 --> 27:04.053
WE'RE TAKING YOU
OUT OF THE HOME,

27:04.053 --> 27:07.056
MOVING YOU BACK IN WITH US.
I DON'T WANT

27:07.056 --> 27:08.728
I'M HAPPY WHERE I AM.

27:08.728 --> 27:12.101
NO, THAT PLACE IS CAUSING YOU
TO MAKE IRRATIONAL DECISIONS.

27:12.101 --> 27:14.904
YOU'RE GOING AFTER
A YOUNGER WOMAN,

27:14.904 --> 27:17.206
SNEAKING INTO HER ROOM
AT NIGHT.

27:17.206 --> 27:19.238
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE
FOR A MAN YOUR AGE.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.240
THERE'S AN EXTRA TWIN
IN JANEY'S ROOM,

27:21.240 --> 27:24.343
AND SHE'LL BE THRILLED TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HER GRANDPA.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.346
COME ON.
IT'S JUST AN ERECTION.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.178
EXCUSE ME?

27:29.178 --> 27:31.180
ALL THE GUY WANTS
IS A WOODY.

27:31.180 --> 27:33.382
GOD FORBID
YOU GET TO BE HIS AGE,

27:33.382 --> 27:35.384
AND YOUR KIDS
WON'T LET YOU HAVE ONE.

27:35.384 --> 27:36.886
HE'S YOUR FATHER.

27:36.886 --> 27:39.028
HE'S TAKEN CARE OF YOU
YOUR ENTIRE LIVES,

27:39.028 --> 27:41.030
GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING.

27:41.030 --> 27:42.331
AND NOW HE NEEDS SOMETHING,

27:42.331 --> 27:44.333
AND YOU WANT TO THROW THAT
IN HIS FACE?

27:44.333 --> 27:47.336
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE

27:47.336 --> 27:49.338
TO GIVE BACK
TO THEIR PARENTS,

27:49.338 --> 27:52.241
WHO WOULD SACRIFICE EVERYTHING
WITHOUT BLINKING...

27:52.241 --> 27:55.244
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH DATING A YOUNGER WOMAN.

27:55.244 --> 27:58.708
IT KEEPS YOU YOUNG. AND THAT'S
MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION.

28:08.217 --> 28:11.961
DOES THE CHIEF ALWAYS...

28:11.961 --> 28:14.263
PAY SUCH ATTENTION
TO HIS PATIENTS,

28:14.263 --> 28:16.265
OR JUST THE ONES...

28:16.265 --> 28:19.398
WHOSE WIVES
HE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH?

28:21.971 --> 28:25.975
SORRY.

28:25.975 --> 28:29.408
HOW'D I DO THIS
TO MYSELF?

28:29.408 --> 28:31.410
HOW DID I END UP HERE?

28:43.452 --> 28:46.996
YOU WOKE UP EVERY MORNING...

28:46.996 --> 28:48.998
AND YOU PROMISED YOURSELF

28:48.998 --> 28:51.260
THAT LAST NIGHT
WOULD BE YOUR LAST DRINK.

28:51.260 --> 28:54.463
AND YOU MADE IT...

28:54.463 --> 28:57.406
UNTIL 9:00 A.M.

28:57.406 --> 28:59.839
OR NOON...

28:59.839 --> 29:03.973
SOME DAYS
TILL COCKTAIL HOUR.

29:03.973 --> 29:06.776
AND YOU WERE SO PLEASED
WITH YOURSELF

29:06.776 --> 29:09.348
THAT YOU REWARDED YOURSELF

29:09.348 --> 29:12.221
WITH A DRINK.

29:12.221 --> 29:14.283
YOU CONVINCED YOURSELF AGAIN

29:14.283 --> 29:16.425
THAT IT WOULD BE
THE ONLY ONE.

29:16.425 --> 29:20.059
YOU HAVE A DISEASE,
THATCHER.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.091
WHEN YOU'RE IN IT,

29:22.091 --> 29:25.795
YOU CAN'T STOP.

29:25.795 --> 29:28.297
YOU CAN'T UNDO WHAT YOU DID.

29:28.297 --> 29:30.269
BUT MEREDITH...

29:30.269 --> 29:33.772
IS OFFERING YOU
A SECOND CHANCE, MAN.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.375
YOU NEED THAT LIVER.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.547
YOU NEED IT NOW...

29:40.549 --> 29:43.512
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.

29:43.512 --> 29:48.888
I TOOK HER CHILDHOOD.

29:48.888 --> 29:52.791
I CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE FROM HER.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.994
YOU...

29:57.967 --> 30:01.130
YOU BETTER TAKE CARE
OF MY GIRLS.

30:01.130 --> 30:04.133
YOU OWE ME AT LEAST THAT.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.940
HEY.
MY STROMAL CANCER PATIENT?

30:10.940 --> 30:12.411
WE'RE GOING FOR THE SURGERY.

30:12.411 --> 30:15.114
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.
HUNT ACTUALLY LISTENED TO ME.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.346
THAT'S GREAT.
RIGHT? I'M GONNA GO
SCRUB IN.

30:17.346 --> 30:19.218
OH, HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

30:19.218 --> 30:21.390
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE WHOLE TICK THING.

30:21.390 --> 30:22.892
(chuckles) I'M FINE.

30:22.892 --> 30:25.925
AH, IT'S--IT'S A SMALL PRICE
TO PAY FOR FRESH AIR.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.057
OKAY. MM.

30:28.057 --> 30:30.259
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.123
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO USED TO
POUR MY CEREAL IN THE MORNING.

30:54.123 --> 30:57.126
THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL
I REMEMBER ABOUT YOU.
