<i>After using
their last time-out,</i>

00:42.001 --> 00:43.753
<i>Poly High
returns to the field.</i>

00:43.836 --> 00:46.714
<i>Down by three,
with three seconds remaining.</i>

00:46.797 --> 00:49.300
<i>This is the last play
of the season, folks.</i>

00:49.967 --> 00:51.969
<i>America loves
an underdog.</i>

00:52.678 --> 00:54.305
Stat reaper come to.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.514
Watch five-seven,
watch five-seven.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.058
- Down.
<i>The slept on.</i>

00:58.476 --> 00:59.518
Open, open!

00:59.602 --> 01:00.728
<i>The little guy.</i>

01:01.604 --> 01:02.897
Block, block, block!
- Get 'em.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.650
<i>The ones
no one believes
can achieve greatness.</i>

01:08.861 --> 01:10.237
<i>But you know
what they love more?</i>

01:13.491 --> 01:15.659
<i>Motherfuckers who was born great.</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:18.579
- Yes!

01:18.662 --> 01:19.830
<i>Motherfuckers like me.</i>

01:20.915 --> 01:23.292
<i>Jaycen 'Two-J's' Jennings.</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:26.212
<i>The birth of a superstar.
Shit.</i>

01:26.295 --> 01:28.506
<i>I'm the pick that got picked
before all the other picks.</i>

01:28.589 --> 01:30.216
<i>This rookie is special.</i>

01:30.299 --> 01:32.092
<i>Breaking records
and laying waste</i>

01:32.176 --> 01:33.886
<i>to all the little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:33.969 --> 01:35.429
<i>who walked on the field.</i>

01:35.513 --> 01:37.556
<i>Smoked again
by Jaycen Jennings.</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:39.266
<i>When he throw
that hand out, it's over.</i>

01:39.725 --> 01:40.851
No one in the game

01:41.185 --> 01:42.394
<i>-could play with him.
- </i>

01:42.728 --> 01:44.855
<i>Man, everybody love me.</i>
<i>Touchdown!</i>

01:44.939 --> 01:45.981
<i>I was
more popular than God.</i>

01:46.065 --> 01:47.233
<i>Two-J's!</i>

01:47.733 --> 01:48.776
<i>And worshipped
in every living room</i>

01:48.859 --> 01:49.902
<i>and every kitchen in America.</i>

01:49.985 --> 01:51.320
<i>Yeah. But check this shit out.</i>

01:52.071 --> 01:54.114
<i>Once you get
to that mountaintop,</i>

01:54.198 --> 01:56.700
<i>everybody wants
to see you fuckin' fall.</i>

01:57.451 --> 01:59.662
The notion that
people are idolizing

01:59.745 --> 02:02.081
Jaycen 'Two-J's' Jennings,
it's ridiculous.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.374

Jennings... And he dropped it!

02:03.457 --> 02:05.209

<i>Has to make that play.</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:06.627
And he went out there
and he didn't deliver,

02:06.710 --> 02:07.920
and he hadn't delivered
the whole game.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.506
<i>What's he call that
stupid dance? The Two-J's?</i>

02:10.589 --> 02:13.634
Why don't you spend more time
on the grass than smoking it.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.969
You're young,
you're successful,

02:15.052 --> 02:16.220
you're making a lot of money.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.055
<i>How could you screw this up?</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:20.891
<i>He's chasing rings harder
than a housewife in Atlanta.</i>

02:20.975 --> 02:22.601
<i>And you know what I say
about those housewives,</i>

02:22.685 --> 02:24.854
<i>at least they stayed in
one city their whole career.</i>

02:24.937 --> 02:26.438
<i>Where's the loyalty?</i>

02:26.522 --> 02:28.232
<i>But all
that irrational-ass hate</i>

02:28.315 --> 02:30.234
<i>teaches you
a very valuable lesson.</i>

02:30.901 --> 02:33.320
<i>Never, ever, ever</i>

02:33.404 --> 02:35.656
<i>count on anyone but yourself.</i>

02:35.739 --> 02:38.993
<i>Fuck your teammates,
fuck your coaches,</i>

02:39.076 --> 02:40.452
<i>fuck your fans.</i>

02:40.536 --> 02:43.038
Hey, Two-J's! You blow!

02:45.541 --> 02:47.835
- Man, fuck everybody.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.756
'Cause at the end of the day,

02:52.840 --> 02:54.300
they're just
some mediocre motherfuckas

02:54.383 --> 02:56.385
tryna hold back
the true greats from reaching

02:56.468 --> 02:58.512
ultimate
mothafuckin' greatness.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.598
That's it for this week.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.391
I'm Jaycen Jennings.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.747
<i>I'm young and I'm old</i>

03:25.623 --> 03:28.167
<i>- I'm rich and I'm poor</i>

03:29.209 --> 03:33.088
<i>I feel like I've been on this
earth many times before</i>

03:33.172 --> 03:34.840
<i>I call it how it is.</i>

03:34.924 --> 03:37.217
<i>The guy was not that good
of a football player.</i>

03:37.301 --> 03:38.385
<i>He didn't care about the game.</i>

03:38.719 --> 03:40.512
<i>He doesn't care
about the purity of the sport.</i>

03:40.596 --> 03:42.056
<i>Listen, this is simple.</i>

03:42.139 --> 03:43.724
<i>My top five receivers
of all time?</i>

03:43.807 --> 03:44.934
<i>- Very simple.</i>
- Man, fuck.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.937
<i>Jerry Rice, Larry Fitz,
T.O., Raymond Berry,</i>

03:48.020 --> 03:49.688
<i>and obviously, Randy Moss.</i>

03:49.772 --> 03:51.523
<i>I can't believe
anyone could think</i>

03:51.607 --> 03:53.943
<i>that Two-J's is a top-five
wide receiver of all time.</i>

03:54.026 --> 03:56.528
<i>I know pornstars that have
received more than him.</i>

03:56.612 --> 03:57.863
<i>- I wanna see</i>

03:57.947 --> 03:59.448
<i>- actual skills, okay?</i>
- The fuck?

03:59.531 --> 04:01.241
<i>I wanna see someone
who's in the end zone...</i>

04:01.325 --> 04:03.577
Sick of this motherfucker

Hashtag, I'm fuckin' you up
when I see you.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.751
Hold on. Emoji.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.837
Eggplant emoji.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.839
Lick.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.424
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.635
Eat a fat baby's dick.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.429
Hashtag,
you don't want that smoke.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.393
<i>SSF,
Ryan Kaushik's office.</i>

04:27.476 --> 04:29.186
- Yo, it's Jaycen.
<i>- Jason Sudeikis?</i>

04:29.645 --> 04:31.397
Mothafucker,
it's Jaycen Jennings!

04:31.480 --> 04:33.816
<i>Oh, Jaycen. I didn't know
he still represented you.</i>

04:34.316 --> 04:35.526
The fuck?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.403
<i>He's on a call right now.
Let me have him call you back.</i>

04:37.486 --> 04:39.029
Man, make it quick. I'm busy.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.240
<i>I'm sorry,
he's in a breakfast meeting.</i>

04:41.323 --> 04:42.783
Fuck!
When is he gonna pick up?

04:42.866 --> 04:44.368
<i>- He's in the bathroom.</i>

04:44.451 --> 04:46.036
- Man, have him call me back.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.287
<i>He's talking to his grandma.</i>

04:47.371 --> 04:48.831
You know what, fuck this shit!

04:54.420 --> 04:56.046
Ask for your salary in
Dogecoin. I'm telling you...

04:56.130 --> 04:58.132
- What's up, Kaufmoney?
- Oh.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.967
Two-J's! My guy.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.176
Uh... You look...

05:01.260 --> 05:02.302
Pissed?

05:02.386 --> 05:03.470
Like somebody's agent

05:03.971 --> 05:05.639
that don't know how to
return fucking phone calls.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.391
You were just about
to be my next call.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.475
That's bullshit.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.269
You're here now, so...

05:10.352 --> 05:11.520
Mothafucker, we had a plan.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.439
I create a dope-ass podcast,

05:13.522 --> 05:15.607
you get my dope ass
a commentary job,

05:16.066 --> 05:17.443
then I get back

05:17.526 --> 05:19.153
in the spotlight again.
Do you remember that?

05:19.236 --> 05:21.780
Yeah, of course, I remember
the motherfuckin' plan.

05:21.864 --> 05:25.325
But the problem with the plan
is that people

05:25.826 --> 05:27.494
say, for no good reason,

05:27.578 --> 05:29.580
that you're a selfish prick

05:29.663 --> 05:30.706
who's impossible to work with.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.624
- That's fucking bullshit!
- Well...

05:32.708 --> 05:33.876
Chip Collins.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.127
Don't they hate his ass?

05:35.586 --> 05:37.129
So, actually, yes.

05:37.212 --> 05:41.300
Chip Collins has a hate-love
ratio of 50-50. Okay?

05:41.383 --> 05:43.427
Yours is 95-5.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.889
Look, if I were you,
I would do some charity work.

05:46.972 --> 05:50.100
Get some positive PR
for your brand, maybe, uh...

05:50.184 --> 05:51.477
Why don't you start
a school for poor kids

05:51.560 --> 05:52.895
like LeBron, huh?

05:52.978 --> 05:55.481
Fuck LeBron James,
and fuck poor kids.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.399
You just need to do
your mothafuckin' job

05:57.483 --> 05:58.650
and get me back in the game.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.319
Man, if I were you, I would

06:00.402 --> 06:02.029
reconsider the <i>Dancing
with the Stars</i> offer,

06:02.112 --> 06:03.572
- that's a really good deal...
- Man, fuck you,

06:03.655 --> 06:05.240
you <i>Harold and Kumar</i>
lookin' motherfucker!

06:05.324 --> 06:10.079
- I'm through with this shit. Fuck this!
- I'll be right back, sir, I just have to
help

06:10.162 --> 06:11.455
- this gentleman.
- Look here,

06:11.955 --> 06:13.832
you red vest-wearing,
Aladdin-looking mothafucker!

06:13.916 --> 06:16.376
You know who the fuck I am?
I'm Jaycen Jennings.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.297
Well known, highly respected,
top-five receiver of all time.

06:21.090 --> 06:22.466
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.884
So, go get
my mothafuckin' car, then.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.220
Hey, hey, Two-J's,
why don't you just relax, man.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.638
The guy's just trying
to do his job.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.139
I don't wanna hear that shit.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.933
<i>Why don't you stay
in your motherfuckin' lane</i>

06:31.016 --> 06:32.434
<i>until you win one of these,
Tony Gonzalez?</i>

06:32.518 --> 06:33.894
Give me my motherfuckin' keys.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.395
<i>Move, nigga.</i>

06:35.479 --> 06:37.064
Acting like you don't know
who the fuck I am.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.398
- Don't worry about him.
Fuck you, Gonzalez!

06:38.482 --> 06:39.858
- I'm self-made.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.530
Fuck!

06:45.030 --> 06:47.116
- Two-J's just got smoked!

06:47.199 --> 06:49.827
<i>Fuck you, Gonzalez!
I'm self-made.</i>

06:55.207 --> 06:56.667
<i>- Fuck!</i>

06:58.127 --> 06:59.962
Well, look who's back
in the news.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.381
My dear friend,
Jaycen Jennings.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.550
If we're talking
about promising stars

07:04.633 --> 07:06.885
that have absolutely
pissed away their careers,

07:06.969 --> 07:09.012
Two-J's,
you're giving R. Kelly

07:09.096 --> 07:11.056
<i>a run for his money.
I mean, what is...</i>

07:11.140 --> 07:12.766
Mr. Jennings!

07:12.850 --> 07:14.059
You see this fool?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.937
Put your phone away so that
we can begin sentencing.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.397
Oh, for sure, my bad.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.859
Mr. Jennings, you've plead
guilty to charges of speeding,

07:21.942 --> 07:24.862
reckless endangerment
and damage to city property.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.530
These charges warrant that

07:26.613 --> 07:28.448
you could spend
five years in prison.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.616
There it is.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.493
But I've decided

07:31.577 --> 07:33.579
that I'm gonna go
a different direction.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.455
Thank you, Judge,

07:35.747 --> 07:37.082
for the celebrity treatment.
I appreciate it.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.542
This motherfucker.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.378
I'm recommending
that you spend 300 hours

07:41.461 --> 07:43.297
of community service
with the Long Beach

07:43.380 --> 07:45.174
Parks and Recreations
Department.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.925
- The fuck?

07:47.009 --> 07:49.344
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute, Judge.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.596
I thought I was getting like

07:50.679 --> 07:52.514
some Martha Stewart
kinda treatment.

07:52.598 --> 07:53.974
Community service
in Long Beach,

07:54.057 --> 07:55.058
that ain't gonna work for me.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.936
You too good for the community
that raised you?

07:58.687 --> 07:59.897
Or maybe you just
don't wanna go back,

07:59.980 --> 08:01.815
after 20 years
of not being home,

08:01.899 --> 08:04.484
in a orange vest
and a pooper-scooper.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.069
Oh, shit.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.491
Janine? Is that you?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.703
Freshman year,
white American history class?

08:15.204 --> 08:17.873
Where we used to play
hide and go get it.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.625
Come on, girl,
you can't cut me no break?

08:20.125 --> 08:21.919
My name is not Janine.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.045
Oh!

08:23.128 --> 08:24.213
It's Tara.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.883
We grew up on the same block.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.509
Fuck.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.553
Your narcissistic ass.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.013
Just get the hell out
of my courtroom,

08:33.096 --> 08:35.307
so I can call everybody
we grew up with

08:35.390 --> 08:37.851
and tell them that they can
catch your Hollywood ass

08:37.935 --> 08:40.187
right up in the park,
scooping up dog shit.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.482
Next!

08:47.444 --> 08:49.529
- You're moving too slow.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.463
Back in the hood,
picking up dog shit.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.257
Wow.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.894
Wow.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.523
Keys!
- Mothafucka!

09:25.023 --> 09:26.316
Cuz, the car
don't come with keys.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.818
Shut the fuck up
before I bust your head

09:27.901 --> 09:28.902
to the white meat, nigga.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.904
I start the car with my phone.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.365
Give me
the motherfucking keys!

09:33.448 --> 09:35.742
Look, you can have
the phone and my car,

09:35.826 --> 09:37.286
just let me
clear the videos real quick.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.453
Niggas see this sex tape

09:38.829 --> 09:40.038
with Two-J's and
Lisa Lampanelli, I'm finished.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.415
Nigga, don't play with...

09:51.300 --> 09:52.342
Jaycen?

09:53.969 --> 09:55.012
Kareem?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.555
Nigga!

09:58.307 --> 10:00.475
Mothafucka, you just put a gun

10:00.559 --> 10:02.311
Relax, J, the safety was on.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.104

10:04.187 --> 10:06.023
It ain't on safety. Damn.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.399
Imagine that.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.234
Ahh! Nigga. I've been trying

10:09.318 --> 10:10.944

with you for years.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.112

10:24.374 --> 10:26.418

10:26.501 --> 10:28.462
I told her,
"Girl, J is my nigga!

10:28.545 --> 10:30.589
"He would never do

Obviously, these cost more

12:33.962 --> 12:34.963

12:35.046 --> 12:36.548
You tryna tell me a janitor

I'm sorry, are you suggesting

13:01.740 --> 13:03.074

And I said, one second!

13:21.134 --> 13:22.802
Mama? This little

13:22.886 --> 13:24.429
You better watch your mouth.

13:24.513 --> 13:25.805
When the last time me and you
was together, what,

13:25.889 --> 13:27.599
'03, '04, Provo?

13:27.682 --> 13:28.683
You do the math.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.186
- Nah, he ain't mine.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.979
We're leaving, let's go.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.689
Already?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.691
Cherise, I drove all the way

13:36.775 --> 13:38.026
You came all the way

13:38.109 --> 13:39.277
to pick up dog shit.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.862
Fuck Tara.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.490
Ain't nobody seen you

13:43.573 --> 13:45.075
Let's go. Come on, boys.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.410
Let's let this man
serve his community.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.495
What about practice?

13:48.954 --> 13:50.247
It's canceled for today.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.957
Where's Coach?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.875
He quit, huh?
Come on, let's go.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.293
Hold on, let me get my stuff.

13:57.712 --> 14:01.091
<i>In football,
you gotta have a short memory.</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:03.343
<i>Fuck a play up,</i>

14:04.302 --> 14:06.555
<i>- and move on.</i>

14:07.264 --> 14:08.306
Hey, sweet face.

I'm headed to the clinic

14:09.558 --> 14:10.559
and I'll be back

14:10.642 --> 14:11.685
- Okay?

14:11.768 --> 14:12.936
- Mwah. Love you.
- Love you, too.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.147
-  Too slow. Too slow.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.234
<i>That's exactly
how I live my life.</i>

14:20.277 --> 14:22.779
<i>Can't be wasting time
thinking about bullshit.</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:24.406
<i>Hurdles into the end zone.</i>

14:24.739 --> 14:27.450
<i>And Jaycen Jennings smoked
both defenders on that one.</i>

14:27.534 --> 14:28.660
Damn!

14:29.536 --> 14:31.955
<i>Like that one girl you
was always trippin' off of...</i>

14:33.790 --> 14:35.875
<i>No matter how good

14:38.003 --> 14:39.462
<i>I'm a firm believer.</i>

14:42.841 --> 14:44.175
- Hold this for me, okay?

14:45.051 --> 14:46.428
I love you, Cherise.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.972
<i>To stay
outta the past.</i>

14:50.265 --> 14:52.183
No matter how good
she still looks.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.563
Did I say that already?

14:57.606 --> 14:58.982
Damn, I just said that.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.863
Who the fuck
ringing my doorbell?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.156
All right, I'm coming.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.744
Family. What's happening,
baby?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.370
What the fuck
is you doing here?

15:12.454 --> 15:14.789
Hey, man, I needed a place
to lay low for a while.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.791
- Man, this is beautiful, baby.
- For a while?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.251
Yeah, for a while, man.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.711
Well, how the fuck you know
where I live?

15:19.794 --> 15:21.171
How I know where you live?

15:21.546 --> 15:24.924
Oh, man, your phone bills,

15:25.008 --> 15:27.385
Hey, man, you gotta be careful
who you give your number to.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.929
I mean, come on,
you know it's me, baby.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.515
And you know,
I got the THC. 100%.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.727
Pow. That shit will make
a nun get naked.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.190
<i>Yeah, name one nigga in
the hood that play like this</i>

15:40.273 --> 15:43.860
<i>I like my weed, uh</i>

15:43.943 --> 15:46.321
<i>- In the mornin'

15:46.404 --> 15:49.157
<i>- I like my weed

15:49.240 --> 15:53.745
Man, them legalizing weed
put a dent in my capital,

15:53.828 --> 15:56.498
but that shit is bomb
as a mothafucker.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.958
You right, this shit is bomb
as a mothafucker.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.128
And look,
the crazy thing about it is,

16:02.212 --> 16:04.631
I copped the weed
down on 15th and Atlantic.

16:04.714 --> 16:05.965
Our old corner?

16:06.049 --> 16:07.801
Yeah, our spot.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.761
Where we used to sling
the pounds at.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.388
Cuz, you still selling weed?

16:13.556 --> 16:15.183
Have you ever
sat back and thought

16:15.266 --> 16:17.018
what you wanna do
with your life?

16:17.102 --> 16:21.189
Many a time, but I mean, look,
man, I got tattoos on my face.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.900
Ain't nobody
fuckin' with me, man.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.152
I feel you, homie,

16:26.236 --> 16:29.155
but I seen somebody today
from back in the day

16:29.239 --> 16:31.825
that didn't look like they was
doing too bad for herself.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.118
Cherise?

16:33.201 --> 16:35.829
- How you know?
-  I can tell how

16:35.912 --> 16:37.288
you got that little
kiddy-ass grin

16:37.372 --> 16:38.581
on your face
when you say her name.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.833
Cuz, ain't nobody grinning, nigga.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.835
Yes, you is.
Boy, you love that girl,

16:41.918 --> 16:43.378
- Cherise, man.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.296
Hey, but look, she thicker
than a motherfucker.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.007
I'm talkin' about thicker
than a Snicker.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.217
Shut up.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.553
And she doing good for herself,
she got the clinic down there

16:51.886 --> 16:53.805
where she helping the kids
with the broken arm.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.640
She help the people
with the dialysis.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.810
Man, she even help me when
I got stabbed that 17 times.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.437
Nigga, you got stabbed?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.022
- You ain't hear? They didn't
tell you I almost lost my arm?
- No, let me see.

17:03.648 --> 17:04.774
Oh, Cuz, you...

17:04.858 --> 17:06.025
Damn!

17:06.109 --> 17:09.028
They said I lost
350,000 pounds of blood.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.113
That much blood?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.157
I ain't hear nothing
about that one.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.616
But anyway...
What happened

17:13.700 --> 17:15.618
to you and Cherise
after high school, man?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.788
Come on, my nigga, you know,
your nigga can't be tied down.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.665
Right, right,
right, right, right.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.959
But you should've seen how
she was on me today though.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.836
But her little
cockblockin'-ass son

17:24.919 --> 17:26.296
and his little football team,

17:26.379 --> 17:27.839
they gotta hurry up
and find a head coach,

17:27.922 --> 17:29.507
so I can slide up on her

17:29.591 --> 17:31.968
and get my peep on
at the park every week.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.094
You know
what I'm talking about?

17:33.178 --> 17:35.180
You tryna
Emilio Estevez that ass,

17:35.263 --> 17:36.389
that's what you's tryna do.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.474
Emilio who?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.434
Emilio Estevez.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.480
Man, he played the coach
on <i>Mighty Ducks.</i>

17:43.563 --> 17:46.691
Man, he ran a cold game
on Joshua Jackson's momma.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.985
First, he taught him
how to use the puck,

17:49.068 --> 17:50.737
then he turned around,

17:50.820 --> 17:52.530
taught her
how to use the stick.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.741
Man, he got that pussy,

17:55.033 --> 17:58.244
and became an American hero
at the same mothafuckin' time.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.247
Kareem,

18:02.207 --> 18:06.127
you kiddie movie
genius watching mothafucka.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.504
I could just see it now.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.256
Jaycen Jennings,
football legend,

18:10.340 --> 18:12.383
- goes back...
- Yeah.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.678
...and saves a ol' raggedy-ass
Pop Warner football team

18:15.762 --> 18:16.763
in his neighborhood.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.014
Yeah, say that then.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.642
You know, people love when
people fuck with poor kids.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.895
This just may be my way
to get America

18:23.978 --> 18:25.230
and Cherise

18:25.313 --> 18:28.066
to fuck with Two-J's
all over again.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.235
You know, God works
in mysterious ways.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.945
- Really do.
- And I love you, boy.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.613
I love you, too.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.864
What the fuck?

18:36.324 --> 18:37.450
Kareem.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.118
Safety was on it, cuz.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.496
Oh, nope.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.040
The safety wasn't on it again.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.918
I'm gonna go home and put
some duct tape on the handle.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.846
- Aye, Ms. Cherise.
Hmm.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.472
This new coach coming or what?

18:59.556 --> 19:01.099
There's a group
of girls posted up

19:01.182 --> 19:02.642
at the parking lot,
checking for me.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.143
Man, they ain't
checking on you.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.354
Checking on this big-ass <i>pito</i>
right here.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.273
Enough!
No more dick talk.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.566
We've already
talked about this.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.067
It's not cute. It's not funny.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.569
Stop smiling, Tony.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.696
It's very creepy.
Nobody likes the creepy kid.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.281
- Understand me?

19:16.364 --> 19:18.032
- Yes, Ms. Evans.
- Okay.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.201
God, I love it when
she puts me in my place.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.120
- What was that?
- Uh, nothing, nothing.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.042
Oh, shit.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.253
What the...

19:30.336 --> 19:31.754
Damn,
it's hella bright though.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.006
That's a Benz.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.426
What?

19:36.509 --> 19:37.886
That thing
is so bright.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.929
That is nice.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.225
Yo, isn't that
the crackhead janitor

19:44.309 --> 19:45.810
that was cleaning up poop
the other day?

19:45.894 --> 19:47.353
Looking like
a hip-hop pirate.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.689
You gotta be kidding me.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.525
Y'all thought I was
a crackhead janitor, huh?

19:52.609 --> 19:54.110
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Yes.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.030
Well, turns out,
I'm a rich-ass celebrity.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.948
And when I heard
about y'all league

19:59.032 --> 20:00.241
not being able to find y'all

20:00.325 --> 20:02.410
one decent,
respectable citizen

20:02.493 --> 20:04.037
to mentor you little dudes,

20:04.120 --> 20:05.997
shit kinda broke my heart.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.749
- What?
- So, I decided to work out

20:07.832 --> 20:09.208
a deal with
the Los Angeles County

20:09.292 --> 20:10.835
Community Outreach Program,

20:10.919 --> 20:12.211
so you could have

20:12.295 --> 20:15.298
football legend,
Jaycen 'Two-J's' Jennings,

20:15.381 --> 20:17.967
as your new head coach.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.928
- Legend?

20:20.011 --> 20:21.262
Man, get outta here, dawg.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.597
Oh, shit, I know who he is.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.765
Good lookin' out.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.558
'Bout time y'all put
some respect on my name.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.894
Nah, he used a fake penis
to cheat on drug tests.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.188
You that same guy

20:30.271 --> 20:31.856
who tried to have sex
with a undercover cop

20:31.940 --> 20:33.316
the night before
a playoff game.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.985
Yeah, and the dude who also...

20:36.069 --> 20:38.112
Won one of these,
you booger-nosed mothafuckas.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.322
That's real?
Bro,

20:39.864 --> 20:41.115
what's with you and all these
random knockoff shit?

20:41.199 --> 20:42.367
Knockoff?

20:42.450 --> 20:44.369
Nigga, my shit
is 100% certified.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.496
- You fuckin' loser.
- Watch it, Jaycen.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.081
They ain't won a game
all season.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.874
They're losers.
It's just a fact.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.459
Damn.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.670
Let me get a picture with
y'all real quick for Twitter.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.837
What?

20:55.171 --> 20:56.881
Anybody got, like,
a clipboard or a whistle,

20:56.965 --> 20:58.383
so I can look like
I'm coaching for real?

20:58.466 --> 20:59.801
Fake-ass coach, man.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.302
- All right, fuck it.
No one wants you here.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.720
Man, don't be
no stranger to danger,

21:02.804 --> 21:03.930
squeeze in for this fuckin'
picture for Twitter,

21:04.013 --> 21:05.348
- come on.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.683
Some of y'all
gonna get some girlfriends

21:06.766 --> 21:08.267
when I finish
with this right here.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.186
Come on, man,
don't be flippin' me off, man,

21:10.269 --> 21:11.729
- give me some real shit, man.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.232
Got 'em! Yes, sir.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.692
Team dismissed.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.194
What? We got a game
against the best team

21:18.277 --> 21:19.737
in the league this weekend.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.197
And you haven't
even seen us practice.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.532
Go run them drills.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.492
- Drills?
- On the hop.

21:24.575 --> 21:27.954
Let's go. On the hop
means run, not walk.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.206
Y'all got y'all a coach now,
hurry up.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.958
I don't know, man,
get your stuff, man.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.836
- And you, chocolate sundae.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.172
What you doin' later tonight?
Wanna grab a drink?

21:38.965 --> 21:40.008
You still smoke?

21:45.763 --> 21:47.932
"Blessed as fuck
to share my greatness

21:48.016 --> 21:49.308
"with the next generation.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.562
"Prayer hands emoji.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.689
"Hashtag,
giving back is what I do.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.733
"More than an athlete.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.194
"Hashtag,
poor kids need love too."

22:02.655 --> 22:05.074
Man, you really click in
with them kids, huh?

22:05.575 --> 22:07.744
It really look like I give
a fuck about 'em, right?

22:09.203 --> 22:11.748
For real. For real, man.
That's real.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.333
Hey, man.
I was thinkin' about

22:14.417 --> 22:16.335
what you said about my life
the other day,

22:16.419 --> 22:18.629
and then boom, it hit me.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.674
Assistant Coach Kareem.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.181
I don't think it's gonna work,
Kareem. That's not...

22:28.264 --> 22:29.390
I don't know, man.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.143
You offensive coach,
I'm defensive coach.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.145
Bam, we gonna be
like <i>Batman and Robin.</i>

22:34.228 --> 22:35.730
They gonna love it.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.899
I like your thought process
and your enthusiasm.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.735
This is a career move.
This is big for me, man.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.278
But, homie, I'm workin'

22:42.361 --> 22:44.113
on my clean-cut coaching brand
right here.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.074
Hey, man, don't say that, man,
don't do that. Don't do that.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.826
And you got a face
full of tattoos, so...

22:53.623 --> 22:54.707
Oh, you gonna unfollow me

22:54.791 --> 22:56.084
- 'cause of that?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.460
- That's petty.
- You wanna play unfair?

22:57.835 --> 22:58.920
- That's petty, that's petty.
- You wanna play unfair?

22:59.212 --> 23:00.254
- That's fuckin' petty.
- What we doin'?

23:00.338 --> 23:01.464
What you mean,
"What we doin'?"

23:01.547 --> 23:02.757
What we doin', man?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.383
Nigga, you not
the assistant coach.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.221
- Like that?
- Yeah, it's like that.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.351
Where the fuck is you going,
cuz? This is my house.

23:13.434 --> 23:15.353
I'm 'bout to eat.
- Hold on, cuz.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.729
I'm taking the pizza poppers.

23:16.813 --> 23:17.897
Slow down,
little nigga.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.524
It's my mothafuckin' house.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.112
Oh. Excuse me.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.238
You the new coach?

23:25.655 --> 23:27.115
Yeah, that's me.
What, somebody talkin' me up?

23:27.198 --> 23:29.367
Yeah. My son, Gary,

23:29.450 --> 23:31.327
told me
you made him run a lap.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.204
I got my eye on you.

23:33.663 --> 23:34.664
Oh, Gary, baby.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.707
I got your inhaler on deck.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.043
You just say the word
and Momma be on that field

23:39.127 --> 23:41.295
faster than you can say
asthma attack.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.049
All right, y'all.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.843
You can grab your jerseys.

23:47.301 --> 23:48.636
I got 'em all
cleaned up for you.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.596
You gonna look fantastic
out there today.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.973
Oh, uh-uh. Hell, no.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.724
Wait a minute,
let me see this shit.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.560
Russell Athletics.

23:55.643 --> 23:58.104
Faded numbers.
No nicknames on the back.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.480
This is garbage.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.315
- This what we own?
- They're the Green team.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.276
Green team?
We cool with Green team?

24:03.359 --> 24:04.735
- Mm-hmm.
Actually,

24:04.819 --> 24:06.112
I think it would
be quite amazing

24:06.195 --> 24:07.363
if we can name ourself
The Dragons.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.447
Man, quit it

24:08.990 --> 24:10.867
with your <i>Game of Thrones</i>
virgin-ass bullshit.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.702
Tre, you're a virgin too.
So be quiet.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.162
- And watch your mouth.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.621
This shit is depressing, man.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.331
Okay, enough.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.963
Positions! Line up!

24:26.549 --> 24:28.342
Now, that's how the fuck
you supposed to look

24:28.426 --> 24:30.428
when you come to a game.
Just like that.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.055
You dress the part,
you play the part.

24:33.681 --> 24:34.724
Oh, my God.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.152
Fuckin' Chip Collins.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.945
- Colonels!

24:57.997 --> 24:59.165
Is that
a freaking drill sergeant

24:59.248 --> 25:00.625
coaching the team,
what the hell?

25:00.708 --> 25:02.501
And what do men do?
Dominate!

25:02.585 --> 25:03.586
And what do men do?

25:03.669 --> 25:04.670
Dominate!

25:04.754 --> 25:06.214
And what do men...

25:07.590 --> 25:09.717
Hold on. Is that...

25:09.800 --> 25:12.053
Oh, my Lord, Two-J's.

25:12.136 --> 25:16.224
Wow! You look,
uh, like a couch, man.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.934
Is everything okay?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.936
Are you living
in this park here?

25:20.019 --> 25:22.355
I know they say that
Black don't crack, but

25:22.438 --> 25:24.857
I see some fractures
in it right now.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.068
I don't live in this park.
I'm here working, coaching.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.320
- You're... You're coaching?
- Yes.

25:29.403 --> 25:30.696
- Children?
- Mm-hmm.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.365
Oh, the community
service thing.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.408
'Cause you drive
like Helen Keller. Gotcha.

25:34.492 --> 25:35.826
- Fuck you, Chip.
- Look,

25:36.244 --> 25:38.120
I know, me and you haven't
seen eye to eye on everything.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.581
Okay, I've said some things.
You've tweeted some things.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.292
But let's put that aside

25:43.376 --> 25:45.503
and focus on the real reason
why we're here.

25:45.586 --> 25:46.712
And what's that?

25:47.255 --> 25:50.049
The positive PR we get
from coaching peewee football.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.222
Joking, man. I'm joking.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.140
No, the kids,
we're here to save the kids,

25:58.224 --> 26:00.226
you know, they'd be out there
doing drive-bys

26:00.309 --> 26:01.978
or whatever else you guys do
in Long Beach.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.312
We are here to be heroes.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.730
You're a hero. Okay?

26:04.814 --> 26:07.191
Government enforced,
but you're still a hero.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.526
I love you, man.

26:10.278 --> 26:12.113
Stretch louder!

26:12.947 --> 26:14.532
Bitch-ass, punk-ass bitch.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.034
Get up,

26:17.118 --> 26:18.577
get dressed,
get up and get to it.

26:18.661 --> 26:19.745
I don't got all day.

26:19.829 --> 26:21.038
I did not
come out here to lose

26:21.122 --> 26:22.498
to no bitch-ass Chip Collins.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.000
Man, we got no shot
at winning this thing.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.668
I mean, you see their team,
they're huge.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.794
I know, right?

26:27.169 --> 26:28.337
I heard they only recruit
high-school dudes.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.298
I heard they lineman
got a baby.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.091
Man, who gives a fuck
what they got?

26:32.174 --> 26:34.510
Put y'all helmets on and
don't fuckin' embarrass me.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.470
Let's go, on the hop.
Let's go!

26:37.763 --> 26:38.764
Yeah, that's it!

26:40.766 --> 26:42.226
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

26:43.436 --> 26:45.271
Be ready, guys, be ready!

26:45.354 --> 26:46.772
You are hungry.
You are hungry.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.779
Damn, he kicked
the shit outta that.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.281
I got it!

26:56.115 --> 26:57.908
Come on! Defense!

26:57.992 --> 26:59.285
- Ooh, shit.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.370
Oh, come on, man.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.706
Booyah! That's what
I'm talkin' about.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.249
- Touchdown!

27:05.333 --> 27:06.500
Hell of a start there.

27:06.584 --> 27:07.668
First play?

27:07.752 --> 27:10.046
Let's go!
Oh, get some, little boy!

27:10.880 --> 27:12.465
You should call
an ambulance.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.633
Two hundred points off
that kid's SAT score.

27:14.717 --> 27:15.926
- Guaranteed.

27:16.010 --> 27:18.304
So, y'all don't know
what the fuck
"don't embarrass me" mean?

27:18.387 --> 27:19.597
Damn!

27:19.680 --> 27:21.515
Tre, Tre, Tre.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.059
- Let's go, Tre.
- Go, go, go.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.146
- Oh, damn!

27:27.772 --> 27:29.899
- Oh, sh... Oh!

27:29.982 --> 27:31.609
Nice! Nice!

27:31.692 --> 27:33.277
Do you have a knife wound
in that shoulder?

27:35.821 --> 27:38.366
- Hey!
- That was filthy, young man.

27:38.449 --> 27:39.658
Catch him!
He's so little!

27:41.369 --> 27:42.536
Fuckin' scary, Rise.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.080
We open.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.706
God damn it, you wide open!

27:45.790 --> 27:47.583
- Dang!
Get that shit!

27:50.169 --> 27:51.295
Get your ass up! Get up!

27:51.712 --> 27:53.839
Let's go, let's go,
defense, markup!

27:53.923 --> 27:56.175
Great hands! Bravo!
Keep it up.

27:57.885 --> 27:58.969
- Look at this shit.

27:59.053 --> 28:00.888
- Whoo!

28:00.971 --> 28:02.139
Coach, I'm gonna be honest.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.224
I don't think
I need this today.

28:03.891 --> 28:04.892
Aah!

28:05.434 --> 28:06.977
- Sorry mothafuckers!
- Sorry, Coach.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.437
God damn!

28:10.231 --> 28:12.024
Huddle! Huddle up,
damn it. Come on.

28:12.108 --> 28:13.275
What's the play?

28:13.776 --> 28:15.903
The play is get outta my way
and let me do my thing.

28:15.986 --> 28:16.987
- Aight?
- What?

28:17.071 --> 28:18.364
- Break!
- Bro, what?

28:18.447 --> 28:19.907
I'mma handle this
on my own.

28:21.158 --> 28:24.787
- Let's go, Tre.
Down, set, hut!

28:28.499 --> 28:30.835
Ooh, shit!
That little mothafucka go!

28:30.918 --> 28:31.919
- Tre.
- Come on, come on, come on.

28:32.002 --> 28:33.170
What's going on over here?

28:33.254 --> 28:34.463
Hey, where's that defense?
Stop him.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.589
- Go, go, go.
Fuck you!

28:35.673 --> 28:37.258
Yes!
- Yes!

28:37.341 --> 28:38.801
God damn!

28:39.510 --> 28:41.220
Hey,
where's the defense?

28:41.303 --> 28:42.555
What's going on over here?

28:42.638 --> 28:44.014
Yeah, yes, to the house, Tre.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.891
-  Hell yeah!

28:45.975 --> 28:48.060
- Yes!

28:48.686 --> 28:50.062
Yes, sir!
Quit it.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.106
Hey, Cherise,
you sure I ain't his daddy?

28:52.189 --> 28:53.190
You wish.

28:53.274 --> 28:54.483
Carl. Call that, Carl.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.943
I got a personal foul.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.862
Facemask on the offense.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.071
Thank you, Carl.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.489
15-yard penalty.
- Come on!

29:00.573 --> 29:02.783
- Replay third down.
- Ref, are you blind?

29:02.867 --> 29:04.410
It's okay, Tre. It's okay.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.745
I got unsportsmanlike conduct.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.330
- Oh, come on.
15-yard penalty.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.291
- I mean...
Great job, Carl.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.334
Sometimes the ref is the MVP.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.171
Bro got a Mickey Mouse voice.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.672
Fifty bucks, he hasn't even

29:16.755 --> 29:18.757
- dropped his balls yet.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.134
Drop this!

29:22.678 --> 29:23.762
Hey!

29:23.846 --> 29:25.097
What the fuck
is you all doing?

29:25.181 --> 29:26.474
Hey! What is going on

29:26.557 --> 29:27.683
- over here?
Fight!

29:27.766 --> 29:29.852
All right.
See, that's what happens

29:29.935 --> 29:31.437
when you get Two-J's.
Great job.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.646
- Fuck!
I need my inhaler.

29:32.730 --> 29:33.939
Gary!

29:34.023 --> 29:36.358
Absolute abomination.
Okay?

29:36.442 --> 29:37.818
But Two-J's got 'em doin'

29:37.902 --> 29:39.320
the same thing
that they would be doing

29:39.403 --> 29:41.739
on the block
right here on the field.

29:41.822 --> 29:42.990
You a bitch, Chip!

29:43.324 --> 29:44.658
That's it, that's it.
I'm calling the game.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.660
Oh, come on, ref!
Nobody even fuckin' bleed!

29:46.744 --> 29:48.662
That ain't the...

29:49.121 --> 29:50.748
- God damn!

29:54.084 --> 29:55.085
Fuck!

29:56.170 --> 29:59.298
Great job out there.
I know, tough circumstances.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.342
<i>This is why you can't have</i>

30:01.425 --> 30:04.678
<i>an egotistical maniac
coaching peewee football.</i>

30:04.762 --> 30:07.097
"Hashtag,
worst role model ever."

30:08.516 --> 30:10.267
Be very careful
with Two-J's.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.394
Guy's got gonorrhea again.
Don't touch him,

30:12.478 --> 30:13.604
- no hugging. All right?
Definitely.

30:16.857 --> 30:19.360
Well, congratulations,
you little assholes.

30:19.443 --> 30:20.736
Got me looking like
a straight mark

30:20.819 --> 30:22.071
in front of
the whole Internet.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.614
Bruh,
they ain't even had beef!

30:24.573 --> 30:25.741
Man, I'm out this bitch.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.368
- Excuse me?
- I'm done listening

30:27.451 --> 30:29.161
to some washed-up loser,
has-been coach.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.329
Fuck you say to me,
little nigga?

30:30.412 --> 30:31.539
- Jaycen!
You heard me.

30:31.622 --> 30:32.873
Go, go wait by the car.

30:32.957 --> 30:35.251
Kid got a real
fuckin' attitude problem.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.503
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

30:37.586 --> 30:40.047
These little kids already have
the world bringing them down,

30:40.130 --> 30:41.340
they don't need
you doing it too.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.759
You really think you're better
than everyone else

30:43.842 --> 30:45.511
because you played for
a professional sports team

30:45.594 --> 30:46.804
over two decades ago?

30:47.221 --> 30:48.639
It's like ever since you made

30:48.722 --> 30:50.432
that stupid Hail Mary catch
in high school,

30:50.516 --> 30:52.142
you've turned your back
on everybody

30:52.226 --> 30:53.561
who ever helped you. Fuck you.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.312
Helped me? Shit.

30:55.396 --> 30:56.981
Ain't nobody help me!

30:57.064 --> 30:59.608
I'm Jaycen Jennings.
I don't owe nobody shit.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.569
I'm self-made!

31:28.387 --> 31:29.972
Man.
- Man, I love you, Coach.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.056
I love you too, son.

31:31.807 --> 31:32.850
Way to go, superstar.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.435
- We did it.
- We did it.

31:34.518 --> 31:35.728
You did it.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.316
Jaycen?

31:42.318 --> 31:43.527
What up, Coach Feis?

31:44.320 --> 31:46.322
Jaycen-goddamn-Jennings.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.491
Oh, man, good to see you, kid.
It's been way too long.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.410
Yeah, it has been a minute, right?

31:51.493 --> 31:53.454
It's been... 20 years, Jaycen.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.332
Jaycen? What happened
to "superstar," Coach?

31:56.415 --> 31:57.708
What's that?

31:57.791 --> 31:59.251
Coach, you used
to call me superstar.

31:59.793 --> 32:00.836
Did I? Hmm.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.296
Coach, are you okay?

32:02.379 --> 32:03.756
Yeah, I'm all right.
What's wrong with you?

32:05.132 --> 32:07.509
Get your ass in here, why
would I call you superstar?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.178
What's all those F's
on your tracksuit for?

32:09.261 --> 32:11.513
- Reminds me of my report card.

32:19.229 --> 32:21.774
God damn, Coach,

32:22.816 --> 32:25.402
this shit is exactly the way
it was when I was here.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.154
Coach, you ain't never
really thought

32:27.237 --> 32:29.114
about, like,
upgrading your shit?

32:29.573 --> 32:30.783
No.

32:30.866 --> 32:31.867
Like your TV.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.994
This is a Zenith. The desk.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.371
This raggedy-ass couch.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.705
I love that couch.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.123
Come on, Coach,
I used to cut class

32:38.207 --> 32:39.792
and take naps
on that couch right there.

32:39.875 --> 32:40.959
Look at it now.

32:41.251 --> 32:43.587
Duct tape on it,
books holding up as a leg,

32:43.671 --> 32:44.797
the shit is a mess.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.882
You know what I think, Coach?

32:47.299 --> 32:49.718
I think I should make
a phone call to Italy 2000

32:49.802 --> 32:51.553
and get you
a brand-new couch up in here.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.014
Get you spooned and groomed
one time.

32:55.557 --> 32:56.892
No, no, forget about that.
What about you?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.477
What you been up to
these past 20 years?

32:58.560 --> 32:59.561
Shit.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.772
Honestly, I'm here

33:01.855 --> 33:03.440
because I don't know
what the fuck I'm doin'.

33:05.234 --> 33:06.276
That I see.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.654
"I see"? Come on, Coach.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.989
Now, you know, you the only
role model in my life.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.242
Do you remember
what you were like

33:13.325 --> 33:14.410
when you showed up here

33:14.493 --> 33:16.787
first practice
of freshman year?

33:16.870 --> 33:18.831
I don't know,
like a baller from the jump,

33:18.914 --> 33:20.082
a diamond in the rough?

33:20.165 --> 33:22.042
Man, you were
a pain in the ass.

33:22.126 --> 33:23.377
Come on, Coach,
see, that kinda talk

33:23.460 --> 33:24.503
with you just
dragging me like that,

33:24.586 --> 33:25.796
how am I gonna
buy you a couch?

33:25.879 --> 33:27.339
You know what, Jaycen,
I appreciate it,

33:27.423 --> 33:28.966
but you know what,
get off my couch, man. Fuck.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.259
Hundreds of my players

33:30.342 --> 33:31.510
have sat on that couch
right there,

33:31.593 --> 33:32.803
and they've come in here

33:32.886 --> 33:34.388
and they've talked to me
about their lives

33:34.471 --> 33:35.931
and their dreams
and their goals.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.475
And you know
better than anyone

33:38.559 --> 33:39.893
that kids from this area,

33:40.686 --> 33:42.354
they're underdogs
in the world.

33:42.438 --> 33:45.691
They grow up with
not one advantage in life.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.943
And sometimes,
that door being open,

33:48.026 --> 33:50.154
and that old couch
right there,

33:50.237 --> 33:52.573
might've been the only safe
haven that those kids had.

33:53.407 --> 33:54.616
So, when you come
and talk to me

33:54.700 --> 33:56.535
about buying me
a new couch, yeah,

33:56.618 --> 33:58.036
all right,
maybe I need a new couch,

33:58.120 --> 33:59.955
because that one's
getting a little worn out.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.584
But, to me, I'd prefer to give
that couch a little TLC.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.461
- Just a little love.
- Oh, shit!

34:06.044 --> 34:07.504
Oh, shit!

34:07.588 --> 34:11.300
You Jedi mind-tricking
mothafucka, you, Coach.

34:11.383 --> 34:12.468
I got it!

34:12.551 --> 34:14.219
You tellin' me
that just because

34:14.303 --> 34:15.763
the kids that I'm coachin',

34:16.096 --> 34:19.016
they may be raggedy and rough
around the edges and shit...

34:19.099 --> 34:20.642
Wait a minute, man,
you're coaching?

34:20.726 --> 34:23.103
But they require TLC.

34:23.187 --> 34:26.190
And if I provide TLC,
they can be just as good

34:26.273 --> 34:27.608
as any team
that's out there,

34:27.691 --> 34:29.777
and that is the key

34:29.860 --> 34:31.987
to becomin'
a mothafuckin' role model.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.697
I get you. I got you.

34:33.781 --> 34:35.991
You the Gandhi of this
mothafuckin' coaching shit.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.118
That's all I needed,
inspiration. I'm out.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.539
THC is some shit. Wow.

34:44.041 --> 34:45.042
Crazy!

34:52.382 --> 34:53.634
He shouldn't
even be here.

34:55.803 --> 34:57.471
I don't want nothing
to do with this guy.

34:57.554 --> 34:58.597
This guy sucks.

35:00.349 --> 35:01.517
Wassup, wassup?

35:03.685 --> 35:05.979
Oh, I see y'all little angry
about my tardiness.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.649
Had that sick feeling
in the pit of your stomach

35:08.732 --> 35:10.025
of being abandoned again?

35:10.108 --> 35:11.819
Yeah.
- Well, good.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.655
That's just the way I want
you little assholes to feel.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.156
Okay, what?
Now, when I first

35:16.240 --> 35:18.158
started coaching this team,

35:18.242 --> 35:20.202
I ain't believe
in none of y'all.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.662
Not even a li'l bit.

35:22.162 --> 35:25.541
Until I got Jedi mind-tricked
into realizing

35:25.624 --> 35:27.584
that I underestimated y'all.

35:27.668 --> 35:29.294
Same way niggas did me.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.172
- See, we the same.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.465
We underdogs.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.592
The dog underneath the dog

35:35.676 --> 35:37.553
that's always getting
pissed and shitted on.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.555
- Where's he getting at?
- But today,

35:39.638 --> 35:41.348
I'm done pissing and shitting
on you kids.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.392
Now, when I look at y'all now,

35:44.518 --> 35:46.812
I don't see
a bunch of assholes.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.606
I see me,
in every last one of y'all.

35:50.691 --> 35:52.109
It ain't no limits
to what y'all can do

35:52.192 --> 35:54.611
with Jaycen Jennings
on the sideline,

35:54.695 --> 35:57.489
coaching
and actually givin' a fuck.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.701
Don't know
what that means.

36:01.702 --> 36:03.203
That's it?

36:03.287 --> 36:04.413
That's your big speech?

36:04.955 --> 36:06.206
So, you're just gonna

36:06.290 --> 36:08.250
stop peeing and pooping
all over us now?

36:09.209 --> 36:11.753
Because you remember
that you were an underdog?

36:12.754 --> 36:14.882
Well, couldn't have
said it better myself.

36:14.965 --> 36:16.383
Corny as hell.

36:16.466 --> 36:17.843

no goddamn trick plays.

37:19.655 --> 37:20.906
But they're so fun.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.543
- Be quiet.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.919
You ever touch a titty before?

38:16.003 --> 38:17.087
Man, of course I have.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.214
So many titties, all sizes.

You gotta hold it tight.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.398
'Cause everybody
wants your titty.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.066
Do I have consent
of touching the titty?

38:38.150 --> 38:39.317
What you just say?

38:39.401 --> 38:40.485
I'm not just

38:40.569 --> 38:41.570

Touching titties

Back in it. Back on line.
Come on, y'all, run it again.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.761
The things you do in practice,
you'll do in the game.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.429
If you're sorry at practice,

39:07.512 --> 39:09.181
you're gonna be sorry

39:09.264 --> 39:10.640
Let's go, on the hop.

39:27.324 --> 39:28.992

Hut.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.331
Oh!

39:47.469 --> 39:49.387
Let's huddle up,
little mothafuckers.

39:49.471 --> 39:51.181
Look, you can't be
the tiniest mothafucker

39:51.264 --> 39:53.433
on the team
and the softest, man.

39:53.517 --> 39:55.060
Quick question, real quick.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.728
Who's your favorite character
on <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

39:56.812 --> 39:58.230
Wait, what?

39:58.313 --> 40:00.232
Do you like the midget
who drinks the wine?

40:00.315 --> 40:02.192
The tall blonde
with the sword?

40:02.275 --> 40:03.944
Or the sister-fucker
with the iron hand?

40:04.027 --> 40:05.362
Oh, my God!

40:05.445 --> 40:06.613
- Coach, you're a fan...
- Uh-uh-uh-uh...

40:07.948 --> 40:09.950
Shut the fuck up.
It's between me and you.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.452
Oh. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.746
I feel like I've always had
a thing for the dragons.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.081
So, I guess Drogon.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.874
Yeah, definitely Drogon.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.292
He's so badass
and everyone's afraid...

40:19.835 --> 40:21.336
That's what I'm looking for
right there.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.671
You take that spirit
to the field

40:22.754 --> 40:24.089
and you go full-on Drogon.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.799
I want you flying around
and burning up shit,

40:25.882 --> 40:28.218
and make 'em respect your
fire-breathing dragon ass.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.971
- You hear me?
- Yes, Coach!

40:32.055 --> 40:33.974

If the ball hits your hand,

40:55.120 --> 40:57.205

Y'all know the rule.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.415

Hey!

42:22.290 --> 42:23.667

42:24.167 --> 42:26.336
A few of the kids

42:26.419 --> 42:28.880
Any way I can trust you

42:28.964 --> 42:31.132
No fucking way. I'm not finna

booger eaters

42:32.717 --> 42:34.386

42:34.469 --> 42:36.304
Jaycen, I have to go to work.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.848
And your players
need their coach

42:38.932 --> 42:40.225
to give them a ride home.

42:40.642 --> 42:42.185
Can you do that,

42:42.269 --> 42:43.270
Coach?

42:43.853 --> 42:46.356
Sure.
Anything for the children.

42:47.816 --> 42:50.277
Fuck that leather.
It's only cow, right?

42:51.194 --> 42:52.279
Yep.

42:52.362 --> 42:53.363
Yep.

42:57.534 --> 43:00.078
You got this
grandpa black interior?

43:00.161 --> 43:02.247

43:02.330 --> 43:04.582
Yo, Coach, you dropping me off

'Cause you got

43:11.423 --> 43:12.799
Hey! What's that gotta do

43:13.591 --> 43:15.343
The bigger your dick,
the longer you can hold it.

43:15.427 --> 43:16.761
That makes sense to me.

43:16.845 --> 43:19.264
I'm pretty sure that's not
how penises work.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.182
Hey, hey, hey,

43:33.236 --> 43:34.446
That's the oldest
trick in the book.

43:34.529 --> 43:35.780
Okay.

43:35.864 --> 43:38.158
With your <i>Squid Game</i>
lookin' ass.

43:38.241 --> 43:39.492
All right,
see you later, Tony.

43:39.576 --> 43:40.618
See you, guys.
Bye, Tony.

43:40.702 --> 43:42.120
See ya.
- Hey, Tony.

43:42.203 --> 43:43.705
You're gonna just leave
your shit in my car?

43:43.788 --> 43:45.874
Uh, I'll just pick it up
from you next practice.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.584
- See you, Coach.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.044
- What was that about?

43:49.127 --> 43:51.129
His parents think
he at Mathletes practice.

43:51.212 --> 43:52.589
What the fuck is a Mathlete?

43:52.672 --> 43:54.841
Only the coolest
after-school club

43:54.924 --> 43:57.260
with the cleverest
play on words ever.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.055
I hate you so much.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.682
Hate the player.
Wait, no. Hate the game.

44:02.766 --> 44:03.892
Hate the player,
not the game.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.643
Not the game.

44:08.396 --> 44:11.191
Thanks for the ride.
Hey, it's cool right here.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.234
My house is, like,
right down the street.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.153
Come on, Dwayne,
it's raining outside.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.571
I can't leave you
out here like that.

44:16.654 --> 44:17.864
Nah, nah, it's cool.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.075
I'mma just, um,
pop up in there

44:20.158 --> 44:21.785
and cop me
some kickstarter cleat.

44:23.203 --> 44:24.204
Okay.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.248
All right.
You get that.

44:36.091 --> 44:37.759
<i>And we lit tonight,
don't worry 'bout tomorrow</i>

44:37.842 --> 44:39.886
<i>When she with me, she feel
like she hit the lotto</i>

44:39.969 --> 44:41.930
<i>And when I walk out,
the tings, they gon' follow</i>

44:42.013 --> 44:43.306
<i>- Bitch, I'm the
- Best</i>

44:43.390 --> 44:46.393
<i>Best, best, best,
best, best, best</i>

44:46.476 --> 44:49.104
<i>Way too blessed,
blessed, blessed, blessed</i>

44:49.187 --> 44:50.772
<i>Blessed, blessed, blessed</i>

44:50.855 --> 44:52.148
<i>Bitch, I'm the best</i>

44:52.232 --> 44:54.859
<i>Best, best, best,
best, best, best</i>

44:54.943 --> 44:56.403
<i>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat, ah!</i>

44:56.486 --> 44:57.529
All right, y'all.

44:58.279 --> 44:59.656
You got pro caliber plays.

45:00.323 --> 45:02.367
A hell of a coach/role model.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.244
And now...

45:05.787 --> 45:06.955
you got these.

45:07.330 --> 45:08.665
Hey, that's crazy!

45:08.748 --> 45:11.418
Look at those helmets.
- Whoa!

45:13.002 --> 45:15.296
Yeah, $10,000 jerseys
for y'all.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.714
Are you tryna buy us off now?

45:17.841 --> 45:19.551
- Shit, I ain't mad at it.
Thank you.

45:20.009 --> 45:21.010
Drogon.

45:21.511 --> 45:23.054
Ooh!
- House of Dragons style.

45:23.138 --> 45:24.597
- No way!
Pretty boy.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.349
Now you look the part

45:26.433 --> 45:27.600
- and you can play the part.
- Okay.

45:27.684 --> 45:28.935
My favorite, Titties.

45:29.894 --> 45:32.313
- The mysterious Ghost.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.482
And this one for you,
Superstar.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.693
And let's see who else we got.

45:37.318 --> 45:40.655
So, is there a reason
why the word "Underdoggs"

45:40.738 --> 45:42.323
has two Gs in it?

45:42.407 --> 45:43.408
Two Gs?

45:43.700 --> 45:44.951
Yeah!

45:45.034 --> 45:46.286
- I got the two Gs right here.

45:46.369 --> 45:47.370
Shit!

45:49.247 --> 45:52.208
- Meet Killa and Skrilla!

45:52.292 --> 45:54.627
Two dogs for two Gs.
You get it?

45:54.711 --> 45:56.421
Kareem, what the fuck
is you doing?

45:56.504 --> 45:57.755
I found 'em chained up

45:57.839 --> 45:59.424
in the back
of the Wienerschnitzel.

45:59.507 --> 46:00.842
Get these fuckin' dogs
outta here,

46:00.925 --> 46:01.926
I'm tryna coach football.

46:02.010 --> 46:03.720
The dogs like football too.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.680
- Man, have a heart.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.851
<i>I'm a Champion all day,
born this way, what about you?</i>

46:09.934 --> 46:12.896
<i>I'm a Champion all day,
born this way, what about you?</i>

46:12.979 --> 46:16.232
<i>I'm a Champion all day,
born this way, what about you?</i>

46:16.941 --> 46:19.486
Mm-hmm.
That's what I'm talking about.

46:19.569 --> 46:21.029
Look the part,
you play the part.

46:21.112 --> 46:23.031
The way y'all look right now,
I see no excuse

46:23.114 --> 46:24.407
for the Underdoggs
not to go out there

46:24.699 --> 46:26.326
and get our first mothafuckin'
win of the season.

46:26.409 --> 46:28.453
Yeah! Yeah!

46:28.536 --> 46:31.039
Let's go. Underdoggs, on me,
"Underdoggs" on three. One...

46:31.122 --> 46:32.582
Let's just get that shit
over with.

46:32.665 --> 46:34.501
Damn, I'mma have to carry
your asses anyway.

46:34.584 --> 46:36.294
Hater.

46:39.088 --> 46:40.298
Let's make a play.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.926
Do you understand
what you got goin' on here?

46:43.551 --> 46:45.261
- We are fuckin' losers.
- Hey!

46:45.345 --> 46:46.346
Losers.
Hut!

46:48.097 --> 46:49.724
- Get it off! Get it off!
Here!

46:49.807 --> 46:51.184
Get it off! Let it go!

46:52.519 --> 46:54.312
- What are you doing?
Throw the ball!

46:54.395 --> 46:56.564
Stop being a fuckin' hotdog,
throw the ball.

46:58.399 --> 46:59.567
What the hell's
wrong with you?

46:59.651 --> 47:01.319
Your daddy
should've pulled out.

47:01.402 --> 47:02.529
- Coach, come on.
Hut.

47:02.612 --> 47:04.113
Yo, make the play, Gary.

47:04.197 --> 47:05.573
What you doing?

47:05.657 --> 47:07.116
- What you doing?
- God damn it!

47:08.368 --> 47:10.161
Oh, my God!
He did it again.

47:10.703 --> 47:12.121
Here! Here!
Hit that shit.

47:12.539 --> 47:13.748
Throw the ball!

47:13.831 --> 47:15.375
Give him the ball, Tre.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.585
- Throw the goddamn ball!
Oh, man!

47:17.669 --> 47:20.046
You're a hardheaded-ass
quarterback.

47:21.673 --> 47:23.466
- Let's go, baby.
- Hey!

47:23.550 --> 47:25.468
Come on, little asshole.
Run the goddamn play.

47:25.552 --> 47:26.553
Set.

47:27.762 --> 47:28.972
Hut!

47:29.722 --> 47:32.141
Tony, hit that shit.
God damn!

47:32.225 --> 47:33.810
What the fuck
is you doing, Tre?

47:33.893 --> 47:35.353
I got him!

47:35.436 --> 47:36.771
Fuck!

47:36.854 --> 47:38.356
Hey, man. That was supposed
to be a handoff.

47:38.439 --> 47:40.024
You think I'd ever
hand it off to you?

47:40.108 --> 47:41.150
- Screw you!
The fuck!

47:41.651 --> 47:43.695
Get off me!

47:43.778 --> 47:44.946
What're y'all doin'?

47:46.823 --> 47:47.949
Fight for real, man!

47:48.032 --> 47:49.033
Watch it!

47:49.450 --> 47:50.702
- Come here, come here.
Back up!

47:50.785 --> 47:51.995
What's your problem?

47:52.078 --> 47:54.372
Get off of me!
Let me go!

47:54.455 --> 47:55.999
Bro, man, let me go.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.001
This shit ends right here
and right mothafuckin' now.

47:58.084 --> 47:59.502
I've been givin'
your little ass a pass

47:59.586 --> 48:01.087
'cause you Cherise's kid
and all,

48:01.170 --> 48:03.131
but you're making it difficult
as fuck right now

48:03.214 --> 48:05.800
for me and your teammates,
and we sick of your shit.

48:05.883 --> 48:06.968
Man, fuck you!

48:07.051 --> 48:08.886
And my teammates, everybody!

48:08.970 --> 48:10.680
I don't owe nobody shit.

48:10.763 --> 48:12.015
I'm self-made.

48:18.146 --> 48:19.522
You sound just like me.

48:19.606 --> 48:20.857
I ain't nothing like you.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.525
You're a washed-up loser.

48:26.362 --> 48:27.947
Yeah. You're right.

48:28.823 --> 48:29.824
I am.

48:31.409 --> 48:33.244
You wanna know
how I became a loser?

48:33.870 --> 48:36.831
By doing the same dumbass shit
you doing right now.

48:39.292 --> 48:42.045
No wonder why nobody wanted
to fuckin' play with me.

48:42.128 --> 48:44.005
Shit is fuckin' irritating.

48:44.881 --> 48:46.424
You know something
though, Tre?

48:47.634 --> 48:49.135
If you really wanna
win a game,

48:49.802 --> 48:51.137
stop pushing away

48:51.220 --> 48:53.139
all the mothafuckers
that's on your team.

48:53.806 --> 48:56.559
But if you ultimately
wanna become a loser,

48:57.852 --> 49:02.398
keep doing the same
dumbass shit that I did.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.426
Remember when in Season 3,
when Khaleesi burns

49:30.510 --> 49:31.636
the slaver's village
to the ground?

49:31.719 --> 49:33.012
What is he talking about?

49:33.096 --> 49:34.806
Oh, my God. You're a fan?

49:34.889 --> 49:37.100
Make them bend
their mothafuckin' knee.

49:38.643 --> 49:39.644
All right?

49:40.144 --> 49:41.562
And you,

49:41.646 --> 49:42.897
take care of that titty.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.190
- Yeah, your titty, man.
All right?

49:44.273 --> 49:45.316
"Underdoggs" on three.
One, two, three.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.609
- Underdoggs!
Underdoggs!

49:48.653 --> 49:50.113
- Come on, Tre.

49:50.196 --> 49:51.864
Stop fighting.
Run the goddamn play.

49:52.907 --> 49:53.908
Set.

49:54.534 --> 49:55.535
Down.

49:55.910 --> 49:56.911
Hut!

49:58.413 --> 49:59.956
<i>Dracarys!</i>

50:01.499 --> 50:02.667
Good block, Gary!
- Yes, yes, yes!

50:02.750 --> 50:04.210
Go, Tony, go!

50:04.293 --> 50:05.586
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

50:05.670 --> 50:07.130
- Oh, oh.
God damn it,

50:07.213 --> 50:08.589
good move! Good shit, baby!

50:11.092 --> 50:12.427
Whoo!

50:12.510 --> 50:13.928
Hold them titties.
Tony, hold them titties.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.680
This is my titty,
this is my titty!

50:15.763 --> 50:17.223
- To the house, to the house!
- This is my titty!

50:17.306 --> 50:18.433
- To the mothafuckin' house!
- This is my titty,

50:18.516 --> 50:19.475
- this is my titty!

50:19.559 --> 50:20.685
Yeah!
- Yeah!

50:20.768 --> 50:21.894
Touchdown!

50:22.395 --> 50:23.688
- Yes!
- Yeah!

50:23.771 --> 50:25.690
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

50:26.983 --> 50:28.735
Hey, hey, whoo,

50:28.818 --> 50:31.654
- whoo, hee, hee, yay!
- The two Js?

50:32.196 --> 50:34.323
Excessive celebration.

50:34.407 --> 50:35.616
- 15-yard penalty...
- Fuck you, ref!

50:36.033 --> 50:37.326
- ...enforced on the kickoff.
- We don't give a fuck.

50:37.410 --> 50:38.828
Underdoggs celebrate,
get used to it.

50:38.911 --> 50:40.413
We'll be back. Let's go!

50:41.330 --> 50:42.832
Yo, Tre, shake that shit!

50:45.251 --> 50:46.794
- Yes, yes, go to the house!

50:46.878 --> 50:48.296
Good shit! Yeah!

50:48.880 --> 50:52.300
Hey, hey, hey!

50:52.383 --> 50:53.593
Eff your flag.
Let's go!

50:55.428 --> 50:56.763
Good block. Yes, sir!

50:58.222 --> 50:59.557
Make the play. Go!

50:59.640 --> 51:00.892
- Let's go!
Touchdown!

51:02.310 --> 51:04.061
To the house!
To the house!

51:04.687 --> 51:05.730
Great run, Gary.

51:07.690 --> 51:08.691
This is my titty!

51:09.275 --> 51:10.860
- Way to go, Tony!

51:10.943 --> 51:12.612
Touchdown!
Fuck yeah!

51:13.404 --> 51:16.657
That's what I'm talking about.
Teamwork make a dream work.

51:19.035 --> 51:20.661
Good shit, Superstar.

51:20.745 --> 51:22.330
Yeah!
- Yeah, whatever.

51:22.413 --> 51:23.873
You're still
a washed-up loser.

51:26.167 --> 51:27.210
Come here.

51:27.293 --> 51:29.045
Come here!

51:29.128 --> 51:31.964
I used to run track, you know,
that's why you fast like that.

51:41.808 --> 51:44.060
Good game today,
Coach. Thanks for the ride.

51:45.144 --> 51:46.145
This cool.

51:46.729 --> 51:47.897
Thanks, Coach.

51:47.980 --> 51:49.732
I'mma just pop up
in here and cop

51:49.816 --> 51:51.526
- me some new shoes real quick.
- Me some new shoes real quick.

51:52.902 --> 51:54.195
Man, no, you not.

51:55.363 --> 51:57.448
Hmm. You know,
when I was your age,

51:57.990 --> 52:00.409
this store
used to be 7-Eleven.

52:00.493 --> 52:02.370
And every day
the school bus dropped me off,

52:02.453 --> 52:03.955
I race up in that mothafucker,

52:04.038 --> 52:05.623
get me some Swishers
or some condoms or whatever,

52:06.290 --> 52:08.167
but I never actually
bought anything.

52:08.876 --> 52:10.670
I was just puttin' on a front,

52:10.753 --> 52:13.047
so nobody'd see me
walkin' home

52:13.130 --> 52:14.674
to that trailer park
around the corner.

52:16.425 --> 52:18.010
The trailer park
around the corner?

52:19.846 --> 52:21.097
Damn, I didn't even know that.

52:21.180 --> 52:22.723
Come on, cuz, are you crazy?

52:22.807 --> 52:24.267
You tell everybody
on the team that you gonna

52:24.350 --> 52:25.601
get you a new pair of shoes
every day.

52:26.936 --> 52:28.145
You think we don't recognize

52:28.229 --> 52:29.772
when you never show up
with none?

52:31.357 --> 52:33.526
All right, fine.

52:34.402 --> 52:35.945
It's just...

52:36.821 --> 52:39.574
It's kinda embarrassing
to be the brokest kid

52:39.657 --> 52:41.534
on a team of broke-ass kids.

52:41.617 --> 52:43.494
Ain't nothin'
to be embarrassed about.

52:43.578 --> 52:45.663
The best underdog stories

52:46.247 --> 52:49.166
start out just like
me and you. You feel me?

52:51.460 --> 52:53.546
You used to live
in a trailer park too?

52:53.629 --> 52:55.798
Lot 4, unit C.

52:56.966 --> 52:57.967
That was me.

53:01.721 --> 53:02.722
All right, Coach.

53:03.472 --> 53:05.099
You can just take me home.

53:08.477 --> 53:10.354
Nah, think I got
a better idea.

53:12.023 --> 53:14.025
Set! Hut!
Let's go, let's go.

53:14.108 --> 53:15.234
Let's go, let's go,
defense, lock up.

53:16.569 --> 53:17.945
Defense!
Bingo!

53:18.237 --> 53:21.198
Pick that shit up, Dwayne,
to the mothafuckin' house!

53:21.282 --> 53:22.533
- Yes!
- Go! Go! Go!

53:22.617 --> 53:23.618
Yes! Yes!

53:23.701 --> 53:24.702
- Yes!
- Yeah!

53:24.785 --> 53:25.786
Yes, way to go, Dwayne!

53:27.622 --> 53:29.248
Yeah! Pretty Boy!

53:30.917 --> 53:32.752
<i>Turns out, bein' an incredible</i>

53:32.835 --> 53:33.836
<i>- role model...</i>
- Yeah!

53:34.503 --> 53:36.464
...well, that shit is easy
as a mothafucker.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.633
Just be real
about who you are,

53:38.716 --> 53:41.344
<i>and suddenly
all of them kids you inspired,</i>

53:41.427 --> 53:43.429
<i>they gonna show the world
who they really be.</i>

53:43.512 --> 53:44.555
Tony?

53:46.265 --> 53:48.059
Mom, Dad.

53:48.142 --> 53:49.435
What are you guys doing here?

53:49.518 --> 53:51.437
We just got a call
from a man named Jaycen.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.981
He said he was your coach
and that you had a game today?

53:59.236 --> 54:00.404
Fuck it.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.239
I haven't been going
to Mathletes practice, okay?

54:02.323 --> 54:04.200
I never even signed up
for that stupid club.

54:04.742 --> 54:05.826
I play football.

54:05.910 --> 54:07.161
I love football.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.829
I'm actually
pretty good at it.

54:08.913 --> 54:11.290
Even though I still fumble,
which I'm improving on,

54:11.374 --> 54:12.959
especially if I imagine
the ball is a titty.

54:14.961 --> 54:16.963
I know you're super mad
at me right now,

54:17.046 --> 54:19.173
but if you could just not be
and let me play,

54:19.256 --> 54:21.008
that would be really dope, okay?

54:23.219 --> 54:25.554
Are you still gonna get
straight A's in school?

54:26.681 --> 54:27.682
Yeah.

54:31.435 --> 54:33.771
Okay. Have fun.

54:36.857 --> 54:38.401
<i>Inspired
not to be little bitches</i>

54:38.484 --> 54:40.069
<i>in front of their parents.</i>

54:40.152 --> 54:43.197
Does his jersey say "Titties"?

54:44.699 --> 54:46.117
<i>Inspired
to shock the world.</i>

54:46.200 --> 54:47.702
Set! Hut!

54:47.785 --> 54:49.704
Let's go, defense.
Let's go!

54:51.789 --> 54:53.040
Yes! Way to go, Ghost!

54:53.624 --> 54:55.209
Go! Hit that shit!

54:55.292 --> 54:57.128
- Yes! Good shit!

54:58.337 --> 54:59.672
Make the play!

54:59.755 --> 55:01.882
- Hit it, Ghost!

55:01.966 --> 55:03.426
- Yes!

55:06.220 --> 55:07.555
Get outta here!

55:12.852 --> 55:15.104
- She's a girl!
- She's a girl.

55:16.522 --> 55:18.107
Oh, shit!

55:18.190 --> 55:19.275
Fantastic.

55:19.358 --> 55:20.901
Gary! I love you, baby,

55:20.985 --> 55:23.612
but Momma's got a new
favorite player. Yes, ma'am!

55:25.448 --> 55:27.908
You can let your hair down
now, baby girl.

55:27.992 --> 55:29.326
Yeah!

55:32.705 --> 55:34.832
So, to all you selfish
assholes out there,

55:35.291 --> 55:36.500
just keep it real.

55:36.584 --> 55:38.085
And if you do that,

55:38.169 --> 55:40.379
then you can become
an inspiration,

55:41.088 --> 55:42.631
just like I did.

55:44.133 --> 55:45.926
<i>Break out the food
and the drinks</i>

55:46.010 --> 55:48.637
<i>- It's gonna be a party
- Well</i>

55:48.721 --> 55:50.931
<i>Turn up the music real loud</i>

55:51.015 --> 55:53.017
<i>- Invite everybody
- Well</i>

55:53.100 --> 55:55.728
<i>Go right 'head and smoke
and play some cards</i>

55:55.811 --> 55:58.064
<i>- Just make yourself at home
- Yeah</i>

55:58.147 --> 56:00.524
<i>It's okay to take
somebody's hand</i>

56:00.608 --> 56:03.235
<i>And get your groove on</i>

56:03.319 --> 56:05.404
<i>- We're all up in here
- Woah</i>

56:05.488 --> 56:07.865
<i>- Timing couldn't be better
- Yeah</i>

56:07.948 --> 56:11.410
<i>I love to see my people
come together</i>

56:11.494 --> 56:14.121
<i>- Talkin' 'bout friends
- Yeah</i>

56:14.205 --> 56:16.916
<i>- Friends
- Oh, and family</i>

56:16.999 --> 56:20.503
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

56:20.586 --> 56:23.130
<i>I'm talkin' 'bout friends</i>

56:23.214 --> 56:26.550
<i>Friends and family</i>

56:26.634 --> 56:30.721
<i>- Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
- Oh</i>

56:30.805 --> 56:33.265
<i>Now everyone is getting along</i>

56:33.349 --> 56:34.433
<i>- Yeah
- The feeling in here</i>

56:34.517 --> 56:36.227
<i>- Is so awesome
- Well</i>

56:36.310 --> 56:38.854
<i>Why don't we just go on
and call this party</i>

56:38.938 --> 56:41.482
<i>- A world reunion?
- Yeah</i>

56:41.565 --> 56:43.526
<i>- We're all up in here
- Woah-oh</i>

56:43.609 --> 56:44.819
<i>Timing couldn't be better</i>

56:44.902 --> 56:46.570
Here's
my hot wheel collection.

56:46.654 --> 56:47.905
Do you need
to add a few more?

56:47.988 --> 56:49.365
Probably about
five or six more.

56:49.448 --> 56:51.617
- Yeah, I would say so.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.910
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.079
That...

56:55.621 --> 56:56.789
Is that Big Shirley?

56:56.872 --> 56:58.165
Yeah,
you know damn well

56:58.249 --> 56:59.416
I wasn't gonna
get rid of Big Shirley.

56:59.500 --> 57:00.793
Wait, is it actually
the same car

57:00.876 --> 57:01.961
from high school or did you...

57:02.419 --> 57:05.965
It is the exact same car
that me and you used to...

57:06.048 --> 57:07.383
Uh-huh. Yeah, I got it.

57:09.677 --> 57:11.804
So many memories in this car.

57:11.887 --> 57:13.222
Oh, wow.

57:13.305 --> 57:14.515
Cherise, do you realize

57:14.598 --> 57:16.433
this is the first time
in so many years

57:16.517 --> 57:18.435
that me and you have actually
been in a room alone?

57:18.519 --> 57:20.479
Don't be nasty now.

57:20.563 --> 57:21.772
I'm just saying.

57:21.856 --> 57:23.941
We can finally talk.
Get caught up.

57:24.024 --> 57:26.360
Talk about the things
you've been doing.

57:27.111 --> 57:29.405
You know, places you've been.

57:29.488 --> 57:32.199
The men you've been with
after I broke up with you.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.370
I still find it hilarious
to this day

57:36.453 --> 57:37.997
that you think
you broke up with me.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.081
'Cause I did.

57:39.165 --> 57:40.457
You didn't though.

57:40.541 --> 57:42.001
But, you know what,
you're too much

57:42.084 --> 57:44.128
of a insufferable egomaniac
to admit it, so...

57:44.211 --> 57:45.880
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

57:45.963 --> 57:48.007
Okay. Hypothetically,

57:48.090 --> 57:50.426
let's say if I was to say it
for the first time, out loud,

57:51.302 --> 57:53.637
that you did actually
break up with me,

57:54.638 --> 57:55.806
what would you say?

58:01.228 --> 58:03.606
I'd say that was
a really hard time for me.

58:05.357 --> 58:06.609
I was so proud of you

58:06.692 --> 58:08.360
and everything
you accomplished, but

58:09.486 --> 58:11.322
I had my own goals and dreams,

58:11.405 --> 58:13.240
and I couldn't spend
the rest of my life

58:13.324 --> 58:14.867
being your plus-one.

58:15.701 --> 58:17.536
And for the record,
I told you all of that.

58:18.454 --> 58:20.831
But all you just kept saying
was, I was...

58:22.541 --> 58:24.376
jealous of your shine.

58:25.961 --> 58:27.671
Which was, you know,

58:28.505 --> 58:29.548
hurtful.

58:32.593 --> 58:34.345
Hypothetically.

58:38.766 --> 58:40.267
Anyways, um,

58:41.644 --> 58:43.312
I really should go
check on the kids.

58:50.194 --> 58:51.278
Hold on,
watch this, watch this.

58:51.362 --> 58:52.905
No,
give me a second time.

58:52.988 --> 58:54.907
One more time, one more time.
One more time, one more.

58:57.034 --> 58:58.410
Ayo, Ghost, do we have to,

58:58.494 --> 58:59.870
like, not use words
like "bitch"

58:59.954 --> 59:01.288
- when we're around you?
Dude.

59:01.372 --> 59:02.623
Or "titties," I mean,

59:02.706 --> 59:04.124
I gotta be able
to say "titties," right?

59:04.208 --> 59:06.001
Bro, you're making this
so weird right now.

59:06.085 --> 59:08.087
You're makin' it weird
by sayin' I'm makin' it weird.

59:08.170 --> 59:09.380
Yo, you are all
making this weird.

59:09.797 --> 59:12.091
So, stop being such bitches.
Jeez.

59:12.174 --> 59:13.884
- Who she say that to?
Whatever.

59:13.968 --> 59:15.177
Man, nobody listens
to her, for real.

59:16.595 --> 59:17.638
Yo, what's she doing?

59:19.431 --> 59:21.350
Bro, she's drinking.

59:22.393 --> 59:23.602
No way!

59:23.686 --> 59:24.937
She just drunk it.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.647
She's gonna end up
like Kareem, bro.

59:30.859 --> 59:31.860
What?

59:33.570 --> 59:35.114
Say what?

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.853
Cherise, let me holla
at you real quick.

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:09.606
Look,

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:11.442
I know this is probably coming
way too late,

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.902
but, um, just so you know,

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.071
every girl I was with
after you,

01:00:16.155 --> 01:00:17.906
I thought about you
the whole time.

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:22.745
That's disturbing.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:24.079
And a little flattering.

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:25.622
No.

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:27.249
- Not even a little.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.626
Nah, but, uh, either way,

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.211
I'm sorry.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.506
For pushing you away
and not supporting you.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.675
For real.

01:00:36.759 --> 01:00:37.760
Thank you.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.346
Means a lot.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:45.934
- Questions.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:47.311
Wha... Who is that?

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:48.771
That's Two-J's,
what do you mean?

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:50.606
- What? That's me, baby.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.317
I mean, I don't remember
the booty being like...

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.277
What, that's me,
what are you talkin' about?

01:00:55.361 --> 01:00:57.988
I mean, I wish.
No, I mean...

01:00:58.072 --> 01:00:59.448
You wish that
my thing was like that?

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.658
No, I mean,
I shouldn't even be...

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:02.743
Where are the kids?

01:01:03.202 --> 01:01:04.953
Oh, I see a goldfish.

01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:06.413
I'mma try and hit it.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.625
Yo, watch your aim!
Oh, shit. My bad, bro.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:11.085
Oh, my God!

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:15.255
I know y'all not pissin'
in my mothafuckin' pool

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.757
with y'all little drunk asses.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.218
Everybody out the pool. Now!

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.011
You heard what she said,
get the fuck out my pool

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:22.429
- with your little drunk asses.
- I saw you peeing.

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:24.807
You're all grounded.
I expected way more. Way more.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.683
Kareem, nigga,
wake your ass up!

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:29.061
Ahhh! Sorry, Momma!

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:30.437
Cuz, the kids been drinkin'.

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:32.314
Come on, dawg, don't go there.

01:01:32.398 --> 01:01:34.858
We used to dip our blunts
in lighter fluid.

01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:36.276
That's basically PCP.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.528
Don't go there,
talkin' 'bout "Kareem."

01:01:38.237 --> 01:01:41.448
Their parents gonna whoop
their ass anyway.

01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:43.200
<i>I wanna

Looks like that bus

knocked some sense
into that head of yours.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:59.425
Yeah! Take 'em out!

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:17.609
Raising Cane's!

01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:19.236
So I wanna give
a double shoutout

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:21.155
to my main man, Todd Graves,
for makin' it happen.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.365
The CEO, Todd,
what's happenin', baby?

01:02:23.449 --> 01:02:24.950
- Yeah!

01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:27.453
<i>The Underdoggs
keep improving</i>

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:28.745
<i>and they keep on winning.</i>

01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:29.955
Touchdown!

01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:31.123
Celebrate,
God damn it!

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:32.875
This is my titty!

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.335
<i>And Titties hasn't
dropped the ball once.</i>

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:36.503
<i>Dracarys!</i>

01:02:36.587 --> 01:02:37.713
<i>Check this out.</i>

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.215
<i>These little assholes have
a bigger fanbase than me.</i>

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:42.217
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:44.344
I mean, how desperate
is this man for attention?

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.429
Maybe it's too much cannabis.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.222
<i>Clearly this is a PR stunt.</i>

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:48.807
- Pop, pop, pop.
<i>Even the Two-J's</i>

01:02:48.891 --> 01:02:50.267
<i>made a comeback.</i>

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.810
<i>I'm really feelin' the love,
y'all.</i>

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:53.103
<i>We're here
for the love of the game,</i>

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:54.480
<i>not the love of ganja.</i>

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:55.606
Put it down.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:57.900
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:00.694
<i>And our last win brings us
not only to the championship,</i>

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.613
<i>but ironically, face to face</i>

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:05.949
<i>with that bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitch, Chip Collins.</i>

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:10.329
Which brings me to my next
lesson for the kids, revenge.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.248
Hashtag,

01:03:13.332 --> 01:03:16.960
best mothafuckin'
role model ever.

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:18.962
Now, how about that?

01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.884
Hey, man.

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.053
Here, I got you.

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:28.013
Hey, Tre, Tre.
Pass it up.

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:30.557
Yo, Ghost.
- Ghost, right here,

01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:31.725
- right here.
- Ball up!

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.605
Ooh!
- Damn!

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:38.982
God damn! Shit!

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.777
You just threw that thing
like 40 yards, easy?

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.237
And?
All right, y'all.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.322
Warm up. Last practice
before the championship.

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:47.574
- Let's get cracking!
- Round up, hurry up!

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:48.992
Team momma, what's happening?

01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:50.494
What's up? Ahh!

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.746
So, apparently,

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.415
Chip Collins has been talking
a lot of shit about you

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:56.542
- on his show lately.
- Don't tell me

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.377
you've been listening
to that garbage, Cherise!

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.295
I mean, what choice do I have?

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.506
My favorite podcast
got soft on me.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.383
- Talking about unity

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:06.468
and working together.

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:08.136
Where else
am I supposed to indulge

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.638
my guilty pleasure
of listening

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:12.808
to some hot-shit asshole
blow smoke every day?

01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:15.769
Did I hear you say
"favorite podcast"?

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.108
Yeah, hold on, let me take
this call, Rise, real quick.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.610
- Yo!
<i>Hey, there he is!</i>

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:25.237
Number-one client
on my call sheet.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.530
Mm-hmm.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.323
<i>Okay. So, you ready?
I just got back</i>

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:30.409
from deep sea fishing
off the coast of Catalina

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:31.743
on Bob Iger's yacht,

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:32.995
<i>and I'm sitting there talkin'</i>

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.163
<i>to my ex-roommate from
Dartmouth, who happens to be</i>

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:36.665
Rupert Murdoch's stepson,

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:38.333
the woke one though,
don't worry.

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:41.753
He tells me that
he is a big fan of yours,

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:43.422
<i>and he's been
following the thing</i>

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:44.923
<i>you're doing with those kids,
the big dogs.</i>

01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:46.008
The Underdoggs.

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:47.467
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:49.094
And he's, like,
shaking up, man,

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:50.387
<i>he's getting so misty-eyed</i>

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.389
that he's telling me
that it makes him

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.224
want to be
a better role model.

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:55.517
- Damn, that's...
<i>- Hilarious. I know,</i>

01:04:55.601 --> 01:04:56.602
<i>he's so full of shit.</i>

01:04:56.685 --> 01:04:57.936
The point is, he knows

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.813
your brand is fucking gold
right now.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:03.650
<i>So, he had his team at Fox
run the numbers, turns out,</i>

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:06.612
more people like you
than hate you now.

01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:08.697
<i>So, this guy is begging me</i>

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.782
to do business with you,
like, begging me.

01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:12.326
Don't fuck with me,
mothafucker, cuz,

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.410
don't fuck with me, cuz.

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:15.120
I fuck with you not.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:16.413
You're ready for the kicker?

01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:20.959
<i>Fox Sports is offering you
your very own weekly show.</i>

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.919
<i>I'm looking at the contract
right now.</i>

01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:24.087
Finally, yes!

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:25.547
What did I tell you, bro?

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.758
America loves poor kids.

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:30.344
Let's go, baby!
Let's go!

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.762
Yes! Yes!

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.388
Damn, bro,

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:34.556
Tiger Woods fist pumping?

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.016
Aye, Kaufmoney.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.267
Do you mind repeating
what you just said?

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:39.186
<i>Oh, I will repeat it.</i>

That's what
I'm talkin' about, man.

<i>Hey, no, no, no,

that you wouldn't pull
any diva shit?

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:13.845
Look, the Underdoggs got

a championship game
to win this Sunday.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:17.432
No, I don't think you fuckin'

Oh, hell nah,

Yo, cancel that.

01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:34.783
- Let me call you back, Kauff.
<i>- Wait, wait, do not...</i>

That's our game, man.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:39.913
We got a chance
at the game.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.081
Don't do this to us.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.124
We got the championship
game, man.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.542
- Jaycen?
- What?

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.003
You're gonna screw us over
like every other coach.

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:48.171
That's what.

01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:49.756
Another one.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.174
This is bullshit.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:52.467
Come on, man, y'all gotta
just let me think, man.

01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:54.177
About what? Leaving us?

01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:55.637
About my life, dawg.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.389
I've been out here
coaching y'all,

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.558
but this phone call I got
is what I've been waitin' on.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.309
What you expect me to do?

01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:04.187
I've been out here livin' this
basic-ass retirement life.

01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:05.856
- I'm sick of that shit.
Damn.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.232
I'm sorry. I ain't realize

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.400
it was making you miserable

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:09.818
hanging around
basic-ass people.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.278
Man, that ain't what I said.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.280
No, that's exactly
what you said.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.449
What, y'all bein' real
fucking selfish right now.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:16.575
Yeah.

01:07:17.993 --> 01:07:19.745
This is my dream come true
right here.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.206
Damn.

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:26.418
Man, forget this.

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.627
Like that? For real?

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:29.755
After all I did
for these kids,

01:07:29.838 --> 01:07:31.131
that's how y'all gonna do me?

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.591
Y'all gonna let
these ungrateful kids

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.009
do me like this?

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:35.677
How you gonna
do us like that?

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:37.345
There you go.

01:07:37.846 --> 01:07:39.264
That's the JJ I know.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:41.683
You know, for a second...

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.729
I actually thought
you wanted to help them.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:47.981
Just for a second.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.484
I feel stupid.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.196
Damn, cuz.

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:57.532
Emilio Estevez gonna be
real disappointed.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:13.423
Fuck.

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:28.271
Tre! Tre!

01:08:28.355 --> 01:08:30.440
Hey, Tre! Hey!

01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:31.691
It's okay.

01:08:36.655 --> 01:08:39.407
Yo, Coach! I'm not crazy.
Right? Right?

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:41.535
I mean, ever since
you Jedi mind-tricked me

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.745
with all that poor-ass couch
and kid talk,

01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:46.081
I've been nothing
but a positive role model

01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:47.415
to them kids, man.

01:08:47.499 --> 01:08:48.834
And now my shit blowin' up,

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:51.086
they want me to stop
what I'm doin',

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.088
continue doin'
what I'm doin' with them

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:54.381
and put my shit on pause.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.966
What the fuck kinda shit
is that?

01:08:56.675 --> 01:08:59.135
Listen, man,
I'm sorry, Jaycen.

01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:00.929
I mean, it's been
a long day for me.

01:09:01.012 --> 01:09:03.348
But I gotta get home
to my family.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.851
- You'll figure it out.
- Come on.

01:09:05.934 --> 01:09:07.102
Family, Coach?

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:08.520
Hey, feel free
to use that couch.

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:09.646
Fuck that couch!

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:14.317
Damn, Jaycen.

Sinners!

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.216
- Slit their throats.
Throats!

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:41.094
And what do men do?
Dominate!

01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:42.721
- And what do men do?
- Dominate!

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:43.930
Heads on spikes!

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.349
Yo, is it just me or do they
look like they got bigger?

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:48.143
- Heads on spikes!
- Heads on spikes!

01:09:48.226 --> 01:09:49.519
Heads on spikes!

01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:51.479
Okay, bring it in for
a prayer, guys. Come on in.

01:09:51.563 --> 01:09:53.899
All right, all right, y'all,
hey, y'all, gather around.

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:56.067
Let's gather around.
Let's get it together.

01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:57.694
Okay, now kids.

01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:59.446
I know y'all haven't had

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:02.240
the best choices of coaches
at this point.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.910
But I just wanna thank
you little mothafuckers

01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:06.453
from the bottom of my heart

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.580
for accepting me

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:11.541
and lettin' me be y'all coach
at this...

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:14.252
I'm gettin' emotional.

01:10:14.336 --> 01:10:15.629
Kareem, don't do it.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:18.006
Kareem, get yourself together.
Kareem.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:19.549
- Breathe.
It's okay, Kareem.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:23.887
Welcome to
Fox Football Sunday.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.972
I'm Curt Menefee,
alongside Terry Bradshaw,

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:28.099
Michael Strahan, Howie Long,

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:30.393
and joining us
as a guest host for the week

01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:32.187
is a man who really
needs no introduction.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.022
Always going above and beyond

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:35.857
the call of community service,

01:10:35.941 --> 01:10:37.901
he's captured
the hearts and the minds

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.819
of the entire sports world,

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.446
inspiring us all,

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:44.074
forming a bond
with these incredible kids

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:45.533
that can never be broken.

01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:47.285
Here at Fox Sports,

01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:50.038
we consider ourselves
a family,

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:51.790
and we couldn't
be more excited

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:54.167
to welcome
into our Fox family,

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.920
not just one of the greatest
players of all time,

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.588
but one of the best people.

01:10:58.672 --> 01:11:01.508
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the new host of FS1's

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.802
<i>You Don't Want That Smoke
with Jaycen Jennings,</i>

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.846
the one and only
Jaycen Jennings. Welcome, JJ.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.181
- Yeah.
- Welcome.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.058
Two-J's! Welcome
to the Fox Family, man.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.697
I gotta get home to my family.

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:25.240
Family.

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:27.367
Family.

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:33.873
I gotta piss.
I'll be right back.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.088
Hey, I told you
we shouldn't hire him.

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:41.256
- I never liked his ass...
- I told you.

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.340
...when he played.

01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:43.508
And I sure as hell

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:44.634
- don't like him now.
- Right.

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:46.636
Why don't we take
a quick, uh, commercial break?

01:11:47.262 --> 01:11:48.430
Oh, that was all on camera

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.640
while we just said all that?

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:53.268
Thank you, Father,
so much

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:54.769
for inventing a hard plastic

01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:57.022
that we can slam
into our opponents' faces,

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.315
causing irreparable damage
to their brains.

01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:01.192
Now, I got a gang

01:12:01.276 --> 01:12:03.695
of inspirational speeches
for y'all,

01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:05.864
to bring y'all together.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.742
If I can find the mothafucker,
they in my pocket somewhere.

01:12:09.743 --> 01:12:12.829
Oh, shit. Oh, you don't need
to see that.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.247
There you are.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.167
Vince Lombardi once said,

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:20.837
"The blood of a covenant
is thicker than a bitch."

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.464
- Oh, oh, oh.

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:23.965
Sorry, Cherise.

01:12:24.049 --> 01:12:26.551
No, Vince Lombardi once said,

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.553
-"The blood of a covenant..."
"Of a covenant...

01:12:30.889 --> 01:12:32.766
"is thicker than
the water of the womb."

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.142
Damn, bro.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.102
Actually,
that wasn't Lombardi.

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:38.063
That was God. In the Bible.

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:40.106
He looks like
a Black Princess Leia.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.067
Gotta be hot
in that fuckin' jacket.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:43.610
Why are you even here?

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:45.904
Good question, Superstar.

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:48.490
I was in the midst of my
triumphant television debut,

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:51.451
when all of a sudden I told
America I had to take a piss.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.619
But really,
it was just an excuse

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:53.745
so I can get up outta there

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.330
and get down here
and talk to you kids.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:56.873
And why the hell
would you do that?

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:59.084
Another excellent question,
Titties.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:00.293
Let me tell you why.

01:13:01.086 --> 01:13:02.087
Family.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.881
A word that a lot of people
take for granted.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.509
You know, some would say,
"Who needs family

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:10.970
"when you got money, fame,
and your own TV talk show?"

01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:13.223
You know, I was at
the pinnacle of my comeback

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:16.935
when gap-tooth wearin' ass
Michael Strahan told me

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:19.187
I was about to become
a part of his family.

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:21.356
But you see,

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.066
he ain't a part of my family.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:24.692
Y'all are.

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:27.112
That's what Coach Feis
was tryna tell me

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:28.696
this whole damn time.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.907
Was I needed to find
my way back home

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:34.202
and get to my family.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:36.913
Sorry I messed up.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.289
Won't happen again.

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:41.126
So, what's up, family?

01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:42.335
Anybody down to go whoop

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:43.962
on some bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:45.797
and win a championship
or what?

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:56.141
Fuck, let's get it!

01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:59.102
Underdoggs, on me.

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:00.436
"Underdoggs" on three.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.731
One, two, three,
Underdoggs!

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:07.110
I could've never said
a speech like that, J.

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:08.570
Where you going, cuz?

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.865
I need you on the sideline
for this one, Coach.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:16.286
Oh! "Assistant Coach Kareem"!

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:18.246
In Old English letters,
just like you like it.

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:20.373
Momma! We made it!

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:23.585
Let's go!

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:24.878
Ready?

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.046
God bless America.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.423
God bless the Colonels.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:31.384
God bless Long Beach,
the nicer parts.

01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:33.636
Bitch-ass, punk-ass bitch!

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.804
- Let's go!

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.265
Let's go, Underdoggs!

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:39.434
Run that offense, Tre.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:41.436
Down! Set!

01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:44.564
Hut!

01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:50.069
Come on, Gary! Get it!

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:52.655
Good block!
Good fuckin' block!

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:53.907
Yeah! Go, go, go!
Hit that shit, Tony!

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.074
- Go! Go!
- Ooh, ooh!

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:58.411
- Yeah! Yes!

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.829
- Way to go! Hell yeah!
- Yeah!

01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:00.955
That's what I'm talking about!

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:02.790
Yes!
- Ref! Carl!

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.376
No touchdown.
- What the fuck?

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.963
I got a holding
on the offense.

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:10.590
That's a 10-yard penalty.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.093
Replay, second down.

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:15.887
Ain't that
the same mothafuckin' ref

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:17.972
that got knocked out
the last time we played him?

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:20.558
Hell yeah.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.728
Aye, ref.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.022
If you take that Slick Rick
patch off your eye,

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:27.982
you'll see you made
the wrong call.

01:15:28.066 --> 01:15:29.484
Okay, that's what
we like to see.

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.444
You lose an eye,
the other one gets stronger.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.404
Go!
Lock up, lock up.

01:15:33.488 --> 01:15:34.489
Defense!

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:36.449
Oh, hey.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.909
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:39.911
Touchdown!

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:41.120
Touchdown!

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:42.747
Justice is served.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.249
Let's go,
let's go, Underdoggs.

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:45.792
- Let's go. Let's go.
You're still in it.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:46.876
Set...

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.002
Let's go, D.

01:15:48.086 --> 01:15:49.170
Go!

01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:53.675
Let's go, let's go,
defense, lock up, lock up!

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.261
Yeah!
Yes!

01:15:56.344 --> 01:15:58.263
- Boom!
- Yeah. Dick in the dirt!

01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:00.139
It's a lady, Timmy!

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:01.808
You want a lady to lay you
on your back like that,

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:02.934
I'll take you to Vegas.

01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:04.852
I got a personal foul.

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:06.187
- Unnecessary roughness.
It's a foul.

01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:07.480
On the defense.
- Oh, come on.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:08.815
Come on, man.
Number 42.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:10.358
That's some solid
officiating, Carl.

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.068
These animals
have been getting away

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:13.319
with murder all season.

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:14.570
Shake it off, guys!

01:16:17.615 --> 01:16:19.659
- Hut!

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:21.452
Let's go, Tre. Pass, pass!

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:24.706
That's holding on the offense.

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:26.040
No touchdown.

01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:27.333
Get your ass
back to the Footlocker.

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:28.584
Go!

01:16:29.002 --> 01:16:30.628
Let's go, defense!
Catch him, catch him!

01:16:30.712 --> 01:16:31.713
Get the fuckin' ball!

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:35.049
Booyah!

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:37.302
Touchdown!
Touchdown!

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.141
When God is on your side,
you cannot fail.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.059
Hut!

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:47.478
Offsides.
- Really?

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:48.771
Oh, it's a pass,
pass, pass.

01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:50.064
What's going on
over here?

01:16:50.148 --> 01:16:51.357
- Personal foul...
Come on!

01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:52.775
- ...roughing the passer.
- Great call, ref.

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.528
Red's on D,
red's on D.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.196
Lock up, lock up!

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.073
Oh, it's a pass, pass, pass!

01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:00.742
- Pick that shit up!
Go, go, go!

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:02.410
- Yeah!
- Good defense, Dwayne.

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:04.203
- Good, D.
- Pass interference.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:05.288
- Foul.
- Oh, come on,

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.748
with the late-flag shit, ref.

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:07.832
I ain't even touch him.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.167
Go, go, get that shit.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.376
I got a false start.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.711
- Come on.
Clipping.

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:13.296
- You're a ref for both sides!
Roughin' the passer.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.464
Come on!

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.007
That one eye's
working overtime.

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:17.425
No touchdown.

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:19.385
Automatic first down.

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:22.347
That's the type of officiating
we like. Keep it up.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.015
How much you pay
the ref, Chip?

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:32.940
Listen up.

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:34.859
I ain't gonna hold you.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:38.237
We in a tough spot.

01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.490
How we gonna win if they keep
calling stuff against us?

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.867
It's like the Battle of
the Bastards out there.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.452
They're hate-fucking us, bro.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.037
All up and down the field.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.622
Hard. Right up the ass.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.298
What are y'all bitchin' about?

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.178
Is this the first time we had
shit workin' against us?

01:18:03.054 --> 01:18:04.347
Shit out of our control?

01:18:06.099 --> 01:18:07.809
Man, we face that every day,

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:09.560
that's why we Underdoggs,
ain't it?

01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:13.606
We always playin' from behind.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:16.150
We gotta work twice as hard
to get half as far.

01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:19.404
But the thing
about the Underdoggs is,

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:21.447
we never fold,
we never surrender.

01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:22.865
When everybody count us out,

01:18:22.949 --> 01:18:24.075
we believe in ourselves.

01:18:26.536 --> 01:18:28.287
So, let's embrace that shit.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.580
Let's embrace who we are.

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:32.792
Let's go out there
and shock the world.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.127
Let's show everybody

01:18:34.419 --> 01:18:35.545
what the mothafuckin'
Underdoggs are made of.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:36.838
Hell yeah!

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:38.923
Yeah!

01:18:40.425 --> 01:18:41.801
Yeah, we got this, dawg.

01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:44.220
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:45.721
Yo, Tre. Tre.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.601
That's what's up, man.

01:18:50.685 --> 01:18:52.854
Let's get dirty.
Yeah!

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:54.021
Yeah!

01:18:57.442 --> 01:18:59.652
Yeah, let's come out
like I wanted to come out.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.737
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.199
Colonels, we're gonna keep on
followin' our destiny. Okay?

01:19:05.283 --> 01:19:06.534
We had some rough
couple of moments.

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:07.994
- Right.
- Matter of fact, you played

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.495
absolutely pathetically
at certain points.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:12.165
It's a miracle
we're up 24-nothing.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:13.416
I had a lot to do with that.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:14.584
Sometimes I can
make miracle...

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:15.960
Yeah,
let's fuckin' go!

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:17.003
Yes, come on!
Man up!

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.505
It's time for that theme song.
New hair. New look.
Let's get it!

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:20.715
Oh, shit. What's this?

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.008
There's some
new ass to kick!

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:23.134
Doggs, go!
Let's go!

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:25.970
<i>Little
bitch-ass, punk-ass bitches</i>

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:28.264
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:30.766
<i>You little bitch-ass,

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.102
<i>Little bitch-ass,

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:35.605
<i>Little bitch-ass,

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:38.441
<i>You little bitch-ass,

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:41.194
<i>You little bitch-ass,

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.488
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:45.198
Oh, very nice, Two-J's.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.741
Love the language.

01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:51.329
Great jerseys, by the way.

01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:53.539
What happened
to the other ones?
They get repo'd at halftime?

01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:55.958
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:58.753
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.713
<i>Little bitch-ass,

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.633
<i>Little bitch-ass,

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:04.967
- <i>Little bitch-ass</i>
- Seem, uh...

01:20:05.051 --> 01:20:06.344
<i>- Punk-ass bitches</i>
- ...angry.

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:07.803
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:09.180
Bitches!

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:10.223
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:11.599
Why do they all seem so angry?

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:13.935
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.144
<i>- Little bitch-ass</i>
- What's up with that?

01:20:15.228 --> 01:20:16.687
<i>- Punk-ass bitches</i>
- Whoo!

01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:18.439
- Someone get me a 40!
Go! Let's go!

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:24.070
Continue dominance, men.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:25.321
Let's go!

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:26.781
Squash 'em.

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:35.039
Let's go!

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:36.374
Go! Go!
Let's go!

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:37.542
Whoo!

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:40.378
Oh, shit!
Go, go, get that shit!

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:42.171
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
What's going on?

01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:44.215
Put some hands on him.
What's going on here?

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:45.716
Yeah!
Oh, good block!

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.051
Watch it! Red comin' in hot!

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:48.344
Spin on his ass, Tre.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:50.555
Oh!

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:52.974
Yeah!

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.308
All day,
all the way, Tre!

01:20:54.392 --> 01:20:56.769
- Go, go, go, go! Yes!

01:20:57.395 --> 01:20:58.896
Wassup!
- Yeah!

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.022
Touchdown.

01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:02.692
Hey, ref, where's the call?

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:03.818
You took care of the referee?

01:21:04.402 --> 01:21:05.570
No, Killa and Skrilla did.

01:21:11.075 --> 01:21:13.077
No holding? Illegal formation?

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.412
Wassup now, Chip?

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.539
- Come on, Carl!

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.124
Let's go, D,
lock up, let's go!

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:19.458
Pass, pass, pass.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:20.835
- Yeah!

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:22.420
Good defense, Dwayne. Good, D.

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:23.921
Where's the call, huh?

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.381
Hut!

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.134
- First down.

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:29.218
Hell yeah!

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:30.970
<i>We got a chance,
I can feel it.</i>

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.471
Go!
Red's on D!

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:33.848
Red's on D!

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:35.516
Oh, it's a pass, pass, pass!

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.435
Bingo!
- Oh, shit! Good pick, Dwayne.

01:21:38.019 --> 01:21:39.729
What the hell
is going on here?

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.731
Go, go,
go, go, go, go!

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:42.982
Stop him!
- Yeah!

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.066
Stop him!

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:46.068
Oh, Prime Time, Deion Sanders!

01:21:46.444 --> 01:21:47.778
Touchdown!

01:21:47.862 --> 01:21:49.739
Turn the fucking ball over
and embarrass me,

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.240
you useless piece of shit.

01:21:51.324 --> 01:21:53.075
Get your asses
back to the sidelines.

01:21:53.159 --> 01:21:54.744
Come on, y'all,
we runnin' outta time!

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:56.912
Go, go, go, get that shit!

01:21:56.996 --> 01:21:58.289
Clipping.

01:21:58.372 --> 01:21:59.373
On the defense.

01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:01.208
What is happening right now?

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:04.003
Down!

01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:06.213
- Go, let's go!
- Come on, Gary!

01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:07.882
- Hut!

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.675
Tony, hit that shit!
Go!

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:15.139
- Touchdown.
- Air Tony like a mothafucker!

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.557
This isn't cheerleading.

01:22:16.641 --> 01:22:18.184
What is this,
Cirque du Soleil?

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.352
Touchdown.
- That's our Tony!

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:20.936
- That's my son!

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.772
You can't be jumping on top
of each other like that.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.023
What the hell?

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.399
We on your
mothafuckin' ass now.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:29.028
I need one yard, first down,

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:30.905
and then you run out
that goddamn clock.

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.114
Get that goddamn ball back!

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:33.407
- Defense!
- Come on!

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:34.867
- Defense!
Set! Hut!

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.203
Let's go!

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.914
Come on, come on, come on,
make the play,
make the play, make the play!

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:40.873
Come on,
come on, come on.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:41.999
Make the hit!

01:22:43.084 --> 01:22:44.835
- Yeah!
- You better, Ghost!

01:22:45.378 --> 01:22:47.088
Oh, God damn it!

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.090
What is wrong with you?

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:50.925
I said do not
fuck this up for me!

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:52.635
You just got dominated, bitch!

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:56.305
First down, Green Team.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.517
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.227
Good shit! Way to go!

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:02.687
Come on, y'all, gather around.

01:23:09.777 --> 01:23:10.778
Man.

01:23:11.779 --> 01:23:14.198
Twenty-five years ago,
I was in this same situation.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:15.324
Right.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:18.119
Down by three,
championship on the line,

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.829
and then bam!

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:21.205
Mothafuckin' miracle happen.

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:23.416
Talkin' about when you caught
the Hail Mary in end zone?

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:25.126
Hell yeah, how you know
about that play?

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:26.293
That shit way older than you.

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:28.295
Been watching me
on YouTube, huh?

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:30.089
Guess I am your role model.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:31.465
Bruh...

01:23:31.549 --> 01:23:32.883
What y'all say,
let's run that shit back?

01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:35.845
- Yo, what about a trick play?
Yeah.

01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:37.304
I love a trick play.

01:23:37.388 --> 01:23:39.056
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.684
Yeah, I think it's time
we pull out our secret weapon.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.811
Great idea, Tony.
Trick or treat, y'all.

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:45.479
"Underdoggs" on three.
Underdoggs, on me.

01:23:45.563 --> 01:23:47.356
- One, two, three, Underdoggs!
Underdoggs!

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.484
Let's go. Let's go!
Run that shit, Tre!

01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:52.611
What are you waiting for?
Get the hell out there!

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.488
Let's go! Go!

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.034
Men, I need a stop here,
and your life depends on it.

01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:00.536
Come on, come on,
pull this shit off.

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:02.329
- Come on!
Whoo!

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:04.165
- Let's go!
Down!

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.083
- Go Underdoggs!
- Come on!

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:08.085
Set!
- Let's go, homie, let's go!

01:24:08.836 --> 01:24:10.337
Ghost!

01:24:12.339 --> 01:24:13.841
Wait, wait.
What's goin' on over here?

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:15.301
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.427
What's she doin' here?

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:17.803
Hold on,
she doesn't play offense.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:19.013
I don't trust her.

01:24:19.305 --> 01:24:21.599
Eyes on her!
That little girl's a psycho!

01:24:28.147 --> 01:24:29.732
Winter is coming!

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.650
- Hut! <i>Dracarys!</i>
Hut!

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:33.277
Run it. Run it.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.862
What's going on here?

01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:37.615
- Follow him!
I'm open! I'm open!

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:39.325
- He's gettin' the ball.
- Run it, run it.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:40.618
Lock him off, lock him off.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:41.660
She's passing
to the midget!

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:43.204
Wait for it. Now!

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:44.663
Throw that bitch, Ghost!
Let it go!

01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:46.290
What the f...
Who's she throwing it to?

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:52.505
<i>America loves
an underdog.</i>

01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:54.965
<i>The slept on.</i>

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:56.801
<i>The little guy.</i>

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:59.762
<i>The one no one believes
can achieve greatness.</i>

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:01.222
Good catch!
Get to the house!

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.182
Tackle him! Tackle him!

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:05.142
<i>But you know
what they love more?</i>

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:07.228
<i>Nothin'.</i>

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:08.938
<i>Because watchin' underdogs win</i>

01:25:09.647 --> 01:25:11.816
<i>is some seriously
inspiring shit.</i>

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:23.202
Fuck!

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.371
Yes! I did it!

01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:27.498
I did it!

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:29.625
Oh, my...

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:31.627
- Tony.

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:35.381
Fuck!

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.674
Fuck!

01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:40.094
<i>But watching them lose
in devastating fashion...</i>

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.390
It was right there.

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:52.314
You all right?

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:58.863
<i>Well, that shit turns
out to be even more inspiring.</i>

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:03.284
Aye, at least
you held on to that titty.

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:12.376
<i>Fuck the scoreboard.</i>

01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:15.045
<i>Fuck the cheap-ass
plastic trophy.</i>

01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:17.089
<i>Fuck the bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.716
<i>that think
they better than you.</i>

01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:20.718
Ain't nothin'
to be sad about, Titties.

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:23.012
Y'all played
y'all asses off today.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:24.346
From the moment
I came out here

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.140
as y'all coach till today,

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:28.267
y'all made me proud.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.394
Y'all made me a different man.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.104
I love y'all.

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.773
Keep your head up. Come on,
your family wanna see you.

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:36.317
- Let's go.

01:26:36.734 --> 01:26:38.360
<i>One little bullshit</i> - <i>ass
setback ain't nothin'</i>

01:26:38.444 --> 01:26:40.654
<i>after a lifetime
of bullshit-ass setbacks.</i>

01:26:40.738 --> 01:26:41.822
- That's all right, baby.
- We love you!

01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:43.532
Heads up, heads up!

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:44.617
It's okay!

01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:46.702
Yeah.

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:48.954
Wow.

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:50.789
Put that chin up.

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:51.874
Way to go, superstar.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:53.542
Superstar?

01:26:54.043 --> 01:26:56.503
What can I say? I'm a Jedi
mind-trickin' mothafucker.

01:26:58.005 --> 01:26:59.465
- Love you, Coach.
- I love you too, son.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:00.549
Go celebrate.

01:27:00.925 --> 01:27:02.718
Champions again!

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:04.762
Champions again!

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:07.640
All right, y'all.

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.266
You know what's happenin'.
We gotta go shake their hands,

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:11.685
- let's go.

01:27:11.769 --> 01:27:13.520
Offense doesn't win
championship!

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:15.230
Defense doesn't win
championship!

01:27:15.314 --> 01:27:17.733
- Coaching wins championships!
- Yo, Coach.

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:19.526
Oh.

01:27:20.319 --> 01:27:21.570
Good game.

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:25.491
Thank you. Good game, Coach.

01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:28.702
Got a talented group here.

01:27:29.662 --> 01:27:31.705
Aye, but don't get it
twisted though.

01:27:31.789 --> 01:27:33.707
We gonna fuck you
mothafuckers up next season.

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:35.918
No cap.

01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:55.354
What if I...

01:27:56.230 --> 01:27:58.273
told you, hypothetically...

01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:00.651
I was really proud of you.

01:28:01.819 --> 01:28:04.071
I would say
you was feelin' me...

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:06.031
hypothetically, of course.

01:28:06.115 --> 01:28:07.366
Right.

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:13.122
You still smoke?

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.132
<i>One defeat
doesn't mean you're defeated.</i>

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:26.176
<i>That shit only makes
an underdog hungrier.</i>

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:30.222
<i>Hungrier for the next
opportunity to defy the odds</i>

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.224
<i>and come back
stronger than ever.</i>

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.308
<i>Because, you see,</i>

01:28:33.684 --> 01:28:35.019
<i>the true power of the underdog</i>

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.480
<i>is that they never
let themselves be beat.</i>

01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:40.899
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:43.402
<i>right there is the definition</i>

01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:46.780
<i>of ultimate
mothafuckin' greatness.</i>
