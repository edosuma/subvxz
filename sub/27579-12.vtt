-Way off-guard.

04:47.791 --> 04:50.192
Ahem. Uh, still haven't heard
what happened.

04:50.259 --> 04:53.596
At school today,
Violet Harper opened
a boom tube

04:53.663 --> 04:56.132
as if Violet Harper
was a Mother Box.

04:56.198 --> 04:58.134
ALL: What?
VIOLET: Mmm-hmm, it's true.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.102
I didn't know I could do it,
until I did it.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.171
Then it seemed, well, natural.

05:02.238 --> 05:05.675
But even for a meta-human
of your abilities,

05:05.742 --> 05:08.611
-how is that possible?
-Maybe I know.

05:08.678 --> 05:10.480
<i>When we were
</i> <i>at Bedlam Central,</i>

05:10.546 --> 05:13.016

</i> <i>a dissected Mother Box.</i>

That must be the device
Baron Bedlam gave to Doctor X.

Simon tried
to learn its secrets

05:19.955 --> 05:21.658

then the machine went dead.

05:26.095 --> 05:28.230
Not just dead. Murdered.

05:28.297 --> 05:30.132

are living computers.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.567
That burst of energy?

05:31.634 --> 05:35.070
It was probably
Mother Box's soul escaping.

05:35.137 --> 05:37.040
Ugh, hello, Megan?

05:37.107 --> 05:41.811

</i> <i>in the business of ditching

05:51.954 --> 05:54.791
Maybe Gabrielle Daou did die.

But the Mother Box's
soul energy or whatever
you want to call it,

05:58.294 --> 06:01.230
merged with Gabrielle's body
and resurrected it as--

06:01.297 --> 06:04.300

I wasn't Gabrielle.

06:04.367 --> 06:07.403

the Mother Box's knowledge.

she'd have to learn anew.

that Gabrielle is dead?
