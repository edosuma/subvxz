00:01.894 --> 00:07.204
This week, one of you will
be going home and one of these
girls will be taking your place.

00:07.204 --> 00:11.213
This is ( bleep ).

00:11.213 --> 00:12.816
Rita:
We're creating
a full music video.

00:12.816 --> 00:16.255
Please, help me
introduce... French Montana.

00:16.255 --> 00:20.263
I love my sister
but now I feel like she is
possibly my biggest competition.

00:20.263 --> 00:24.372
- Drew: <i>Marissa,
it's your moment.</i>
- Ashley: Come on, Marissa.

00:24.372 --> 00:27.612
The energy is not there.

00:27.612 --> 00:30.417
The one that is staying
another week... Courtney.

00:30.417 --> 00:33.891
- Marissa, you have
so much ahead of you.
- Thank you so much.

00:33.891 --> 00:37.064
So who will be getting
the second chance to come back?

00:37.064 --> 00:40.404
<i>Tash.
Congratulations.</i>

00:40.404 --> 00:41.707
- Welcome back into
the competition.
- Thank you.

00:43.076 --> 00:43.911
( opening credits music )

01:27.164 --> 01:31.907
Wow, y'all,
look at that dance video.

01:31.907 --> 01:35.180
Drew:
<i>Hip, booty, hip.</i>

01:35.180 --> 01:35.447
I'm super stoked
that I won best video.

01:39.856 --> 01:41.527
Paige was the leader
of our group

01:41.527 --> 01:41.960
but I got called for her
in panel which is pretty cool.

01:47.639 --> 01:52.516
- Stop. I am not.
- Tatiana: <i>I'm kidding.</i>

01:52.516 --> 01:55.420
I think Tatiana was
saying it as a joke because...

01:55.420 --> 01:57.926
she knows that
she is my biggest competition.
The judges just love her.

01:57.926 --> 02:01.700
- This is just taking you to
another level. - Lou: <i>This is
the high life.</i>

02:01.700 --> 02:03.671
- <i>This is what
this week was about.</i>
- Ashley: Good job.

02:03.671 --> 02:06.042
- Rita: <i>You killed it.</i>
- Thank you.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.512
India:
But she can be a little bit
cocky whereas unhumble

02:07.512 --> 02:10.116
and that's just
kind of my nature.

02:10.116 --> 02:11.452
How do you feel?

02:14.158 --> 02:15.862
I still feel
like in shock.

02:15.862 --> 02:18.099
The fact that I've won my
way back into this competition,

02:18.099 --> 02:21.540
I do believe
it speaks volumes.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.777
I just feel
like I belong here

02:23.777 --> 02:26.182
and I am absolutely determined
to win this competition.

02:26.182 --> 02:29.856
- Wow, so determined.
- Thank you.

02:29.856 --> 02:33.797
Cody:
I've always felt like
my sister overshadowed me.

02:33.797 --> 02:36.336
And the time alone made me
realize when I'm by myself

02:36.336 --> 02:40.244
<i>I have more confidence
when I'm modeling</i>

02:40.244 --> 02:42.516
<i>so having my sister back</i>

02:42.516 --> 02:44.385
it could definitely
be a disadvantage.

02:44.385 --> 02:46.222
- Rita: <i>RitAlert.</i>
- Get down here.

02:46.222 --> 02:48.126
<i>Oh my God, woo!</i>

02:48.126 --> 02:49.461
Hi, ladies.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.871
So a boss has a
responsibility to make their
voice heard.

02:53.871 --> 02:58.714
Do with conviction.
Good luck.

02:58.714 --> 03:00.885
I think it's like public
speaking talking to a big crowd.

03:00.885 --> 03:03.490
Tatiana:
<i>Are you joking?</i> I swear,

03:03.490 --> 03:04.191
if we're singing
I'm gonna die.

03:07.532 --> 03:10.838
We got jumping on trampoline,
she's like, "I'm the
cheerleader."

03:10.838 --> 03:13.911
We got dancing, she's like,
"I was a dancer."

03:13.911 --> 03:16.617
Let's just pass
the crown to Paige.

03:16.617 --> 03:18.252
Huge super models can do
a lot of different things.

03:18.252 --> 03:21.092
They can dance,
they can sing,

03:21.092 --> 03:22.595
they can act
as well as just being a model.

03:22.595 --> 03:25.067
<i>And that is absolutely
what I think I embody</i>

03:25.067 --> 03:28.106
<i>and what I could bring
to the table</i>

03:28.106 --> 03:29.576
<i>as America's
next top model.</i>

03:29.576 --> 03:30.043
So I am confident but also,
you know, cautious.

03:39.763 --> 03:44.540
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

03:44.540 --> 03:47.077
India:
I like having Ashley
here, honesty.

03:47.077 --> 03:48.446
I think any time that
a judge can see you

03:48.446 --> 03:50.751
in your element
is always a bonus.

03:50.751 --> 03:53.389
You all know that
I'm an outspoken body activist.

03:53.389 --> 03:55.093
<i>Today we're gonna talk
about something</i>

03:55.093 --> 03:57.431
that is very important
to me.

03:57.431 --> 03:58.934
Being socially responsible
and using your power platform

03:58.934 --> 04:02.642
to give a voice
to important causes.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.114
It's really important as
a celebrity, as a super model

04:05.114 --> 04:06.950
to have something that
you believe in and a cause

04:06.950 --> 04:09.556
because as your star rises

04:09.556 --> 04:12.394
the more power you have

04:12.394 --> 04:13.898
and the more change
you can put into the world.

04:13.898 --> 04:16.402
Okay, ladies, I'm gonna split
you into two groups.

04:16.402 --> 04:19.074
One team of 4
and one team of 3.

04:19.074 --> 04:21.112
Team 1 is India,
Paige, Cody, and Tash.

04:21.112 --> 04:23.684
And Team 2 is Tatiana,
Coryanne, and Courtney.

04:23.684 --> 04:27.490
Okay, so each group
is gonna work together

04:27.490 --> 04:29.061
to make a 15 to 20 second
public service announcement

04:29.061 --> 04:32.267
for an organization that
was started by Amber Rose

04:32.267 --> 04:34.639
- <i>called "Slut Walk."</i>
- Wow.

04:34.639 --> 04:37.177
Amber started this organization
to empower women

04:37.177 --> 04:39.181
to have control over
their own sexuality.

04:39.181 --> 04:42.589
And she is here today.

04:42.589 --> 04:44.024
- <i>Come on out, sister.</i>
- ( screaming )

04:44.024 --> 04:47.498
- Hello, hello.
- Hi, Amber.

04:47.498 --> 04:50.336
Coryanne: <i>Amber Rose
has a talk show.</i>

04:50.336 --> 04:53.009
She's all about activism.
Amber Rose is a boss.

04:53.009 --> 04:55.514
<i>She's what
we're trying to be.</i>

04:55.514 --> 04:57.384
Well, you guys know
this "Slut Walk"

04:57.384 --> 04:58.821
is near and dear
to my heart.

04:58.821 --> 05:00.324
It is about double standards,
slut shaming,

05:00.324 --> 05:02.863
victim blaming,
sexual assault, and rape.

05:02.863 --> 05:06.202
I feel like as women, we kinda
dealt with at least one of them.

05:06.202 --> 05:10.376
I decided to have
a slut walk

05:10.376 --> 05:12.047
- for women that haven
been through ( bleep ). - (
ovation )

05:13.316 --> 05:18.326
I feel like as a society,

05:18.326 --> 05:18.560
we have been taught
to always please a man

05:19.863 --> 05:24.672
<i>and a man is
always superior</i>

05:24.672 --> 05:26.376
and everything that we do is
for our man and that's not true.

05:26.376 --> 05:28.648
Everything that we do,
we should do it for ourselves

05:28.648 --> 05:30.818
and at the end of day
all we want is equality.

05:30.818 --> 05:34.893
I really would like
to see you guys

05:34.893 --> 05:37.197
show the pain and the struggle
but also make it very beautiful.

05:37.197 --> 05:41.205
We will provide you with
the tools for this challenge

05:41.205 --> 05:43.477
but you will be in charge
of making this video.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.048
Each team will come up
with a group shot

05:46.048 --> 05:47.084
<i>and individual close-ups to
deliver a line that you
write</i>

05:47.084 --> 05:50.724
and to drive the point home,

05:50.724 --> 05:52.261
you will all have a piece
a glass that you can smash.

05:52.261 --> 05:55.400
So you guys are gonna
be given one hour

05:55.400 --> 05:56.904
and your time
begins...

05:56.904 --> 05:58.205
now.

06:00.176 --> 06:05.386
Okay, girls.
This is gonna help you

06:05.386 --> 06:07.591
- write your PSA.
It's some general information.
- Thank you.

06:07.591 --> 06:11.499
Paige:
<i>This is a great cause</i>

06:11.499 --> 06:13.403
and something that we as
women can definitely understand

06:13.403 --> 06:16.109
<i>so it's a huge deal
for me to impress Ashley</i>

06:16.109 --> 06:20.050
and to show her
I absolutely am the boss

06:20.050 --> 06:23.023
that they are looking for
and I wanna make sure
that she knows that.

06:23.023 --> 06:26.028
There's so much sexual
misconduct that happens
on college campuses

06:26.028 --> 06:30.437
I want my tag line
to be about

06:30.437 --> 06:32.107
that just because
I'm wearing a slut outfit

06:32.107 --> 06:33.376
does not mean
that I am consenting.

06:33.376 --> 06:35.647
- Hola, chicas.
- Hi.

06:35.647 --> 06:37.619
- Okay, so this is just
a little info...
- Okay.

06:37.619 --> 06:39.990
...on the "Slut Walk"
and to give you some ideas

06:39.990 --> 06:42.762
on what on what
to write for your PSA.

06:42.762 --> 06:43.764
- All right?
- Thank you.

06:43.764 --> 06:46.636
I'm excited.

06:46.636 --> 06:48.608
It says
the Department of Justice
offers a low estimate

06:48.608 --> 06:51.580
of 300,000 women
will be raped in one year.

06:51.580 --> 06:55.153
- ( bleep ). That's scary.
- It's so creepy.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.489
You know, I read all
the facts, I was like,

06:56.489 --> 06:58.594
I had no idea it was
such a huge pandemic

06:58.594 --> 07:00.965
like 1 in 4 women in
college are raped, things like
that.

07:00.965 --> 07:03.604
And so I really wanted
to try hard. I was like,
this is such an important thing.

07:03.604 --> 07:07.110
We need to come up with
an overall message and then
our individual messages.

07:07.110 --> 07:10.852
Slut shaming is saying, like,
the double standard girls can
have sex with a lot of guys...

07:10.852 --> 07:13.924
- Tatiana: <i>Exactly.</i>
- ...and they're sluts
but guys are okay.

07:13.924 --> 07:16.830
Tatiana:
<i>Coryanne and I, we're excited
to work together</i>

07:16.830 --> 07:18.065
but Courtney just
aggravates me and she had two
weeks in a row

07:18.065 --> 07:21.239
where she kinda
didn't perform well.

07:21.239 --> 07:23.143
<i>If I happen to lose
because of her</i>

07:23.143 --> 07:25.147
that would kinda get
on my nerves.

07:25.147 --> 07:27.518
<i>Well, mine is
no judgment.</i>

07:27.518 --> 07:29.488
Like, whether you wanna
be a-- whether
you wanna be a slut,

07:29.488 --> 07:31.325
whether you wanna
be a housewife,
whether you wanna be a stripper,

07:31.325 --> 07:33.163
whether you wanna be whatever,
no judgment.

07:33.163 --> 07:34.999
I think it's a little deeper
than that though.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.836
Maybe yours can be a deeper
aspect of that,

07:36.836 --> 07:37.972
but I'm saying for me,
personally, that's what
I'm gonna use.

07:37.972 --> 07:40.812
No, but I'm just asking.

07:40.812 --> 07:42.849
We don't need just broad ideas
'cause we already have those.

07:42.849 --> 07:46.121
We need to come
with specific stuff.

07:46.121 --> 07:47.525
The thing with Tati is she
has a hard time not being in
control.

07:47.525 --> 07:52.100
- So you do your
individual thing...
- Okay.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.804
...I'm gonna do my
individual thing which I already
know

07:53.804 --> 07:55.608
and you're gonna write down
your individual thing

07:55.608 --> 07:57.377
and then we need to come up
with something together.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.947
I'm very determined
to win this challenge

07:58.947 --> 08:00.985
because I know that
if I'm in bottom two again

08:00.985 --> 08:03.524
I'm gonna go home.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.993
Like, for me, I feel like
any man I give myself to,

08:04.993 --> 08:08.700
- he's the lucky one.
- Girls: Yeah.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.670
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

08:09.670 --> 08:11.706
Cody:
<i>Damn it.</i>

08:11.706 --> 08:13.342
<i>Tash is so confident
now that she's back</i>

08:13.342 --> 08:16.583
<i>but I have to focus
on myself</i>

08:16.583 --> 08:17.852
and I know that every time
I step onto that stage

08:17.852 --> 08:21.225
I'm gonna my
absolute best.

08:21.225 --> 08:22.394
Just because I like her,
doesn't mean he treated me
wrong.

08:22.394 --> 08:26.503
What is that magical
word at the end?

08:26.503 --> 08:27.538
Just because I like her,
doesn't mean I hate him.

08:28.807 --> 08:30.042
Aw, thank you.

08:33.416 --> 08:35.020
- We're helping each other
out. - It's good.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.856
We're all working
so well together

08:36.856 --> 08:38.660
that the time
isn't even bothering us.

08:38.660 --> 08:41.399
<i>And the fact that
we're not fighting</i>

08:41.399 --> 08:43.369
<i>like I have a feeling
the other team is</i>

08:43.369 --> 08:45.875
I think is gonna be
a good thing.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.779
Ladies, 10 minutes, 10 minutes
until you guys actually
have to shoot this.

08:47.779 --> 08:52.387
Tatiana:
Have you heard of "Slut Walk?"
It's basically saying,

08:52.387 --> 08:54.225
everyone saying, "Okay, you know
what, I've done some things,

08:54.225 --> 08:56.395
I did what I had to do
but at the end of the day...

08:56.395 --> 08:58.099
Don't call me a slut
because you don't know me," type
of thing.

08:58.099 --> 09:01.205
Can you wait until
I'm freaking finished?

09:01.205 --> 09:03.109
Like, damn, I'm talking.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.514
Well, write it down, then,
'cause I'm having--

09:05.514 --> 09:07.017
( bleep ), it was so good.

09:07.017 --> 09:07.417
I'm sexy with clothing
and without.

09:09.421 --> 09:12.528
Don't judge us.

09:12.528 --> 09:14.766
They did not get it.

09:14.766 --> 09:16.435
With this character,
it's a little bit raunchier
and dirtier.

09:16.435 --> 09:19.408
Give me that editorial
back at the grocery store.

09:19.408 --> 09:21.946
I don't know where
the confidence has gone.

09:21.946 --> 09:23.550
You're coasting right now.

09:23.550 --> 09:24.585
Do not get comfortable.

09:33.938 --> 09:38.480
We need energy,
energy, energy.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.916
Oh, yeah. I just wanna
look fierce, though.

09:39.916 --> 09:42.221
So today's been really cool,

09:42.221 --> 09:44.324
<i>the girls doing a PSA
for my "Slut Walk"</i>

09:44.324 --> 09:46.797
and I'm really excited to
see who actually did their
research.

09:46.797 --> 09:49.001
- Ashley: <i>Team 2, you guys
are gonna go first.</i>
- Tatiana: We're ready.

09:49.001 --> 09:52.173
You have 15 minutes.

09:52.173 --> 09:53.977
Courtney:
So we decided we were gonna
start off with a group shot

09:53.977 --> 09:57.083
and our thing
was "Don't judge me."

09:57.083 --> 09:59.522
- Should we do it in unison
'cause if we can't--
- No, we need to all say it.

09:59.522 --> 10:02.227
"Don't judge me" at once...
We're ready.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.768
Man:
<i>Action.</i>

10:05.768 --> 10:08.439
- All: Don't judge me.
- ( bleep ).

10:08.439 --> 10:10.744
- That's what I'm saying
we should just do it separately.
- You're right.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.082
- Man: <i>Action.</i>
- Courtney: We started off
a little bit nervous.

10:13.082 --> 10:15.353
<i>It takes a minute, to like,
jump into it on set</i>

10:15.353 --> 10:18.125
especially when you
only have 15 minutes

10:18.125 --> 10:20.263
to get this whole
entire video done

10:20.263 --> 10:23.202
with different shots
and different angles.

10:23.202 --> 10:24.606
- Tatiana: <i>One more time.</i>
- Okay, but remember,
you don't have a lot of time,

10:24.606 --> 10:26.943
- you got 3 singles.
- Man: <i>Action.</i>

10:26.943 --> 10:28.947
Don't judge me, I'm not
walking down the street for
your entertainment

10:28.947 --> 10:32.521
I'm just for me,
not you.

10:32.521 --> 10:34.726
Don't judge me just because
I'm focusing on my career.

10:34.726 --> 10:36.763
Don't judge me just
because I like to shop
in both sections at the store.

10:36.763 --> 10:40.370
All:
Don't judge us.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.541
- That was it.
- That's good.

10:42.541 --> 10:43.342
- Man: <i>Action.</i> - I
do not want nor do I need a man
to provide for me.

10:46.381 --> 10:48.285
- Okay, Courtney.
- Is that cool?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.329
We already had an order.
I don't understand
how the order's gotten...

10:53.329 --> 10:56.235
Wait, we never talked
about an order...

10:56.235 --> 10:58.072
Courtney and Tatiana
were kinda fighting.

10:58.072 --> 11:00.476
<i>It doesn't matter
who's going next.</i>

11:00.476 --> 11:01.880
You have to embody
this persona

11:01.880 --> 11:03.917
of lifting each other up
constantly.

11:03.917 --> 11:06.422
This is a team effort.

11:06.422 --> 11:08.192
- Go, it' fine. Okay.
- Okay, just go.

11:08.192 --> 11:08.727
Cat calling is not the way
to get my attention.

11:11.398 --> 11:14.170
- It's rude and
it's disrespectful.
- That was good.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.042
Just because I decide to dress
like the opposite den--

11:16.042 --> 11:19.582
gender... ( bleep ).

11:19.582 --> 11:21.586
The slower you go,
the more-- the easier it is.

11:21.586 --> 11:24.325
Just because I decide to
dress like the opposite gender,

11:24.325 --> 11:27.765
does not change my sex
nor my rights as a woman.

11:27.765 --> 11:31.539
Much better. Much,
much, much better.

11:31.539 --> 11:33.610
Altogether our messages
were really, really cohesive.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.382
You guys wanna break the
glass? You have like five
minutes.

11:36.382 --> 11:38.787
Yes, let's go ahead
and break the glass.

11:38.787 --> 11:39.956
But I am a little worried that,
like, our chemistry kinda
was a little off.

11:39.956 --> 11:43.530
Man:
<i>Action.</i>

11:43.530 --> 11:45.033
I don't how how well we
did based on the energy level.

11:45.033 --> 11:48.740
Ashley:
<i>Team 1, you're up.</i>

11:48.740 --> 11:50.243
Let's just stand,
really strong.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.948
Just strong, "model-ly"
but beautiful.

11:52.948 --> 11:55.120
Hey, guys I just wanted to
let you know you got a 15 minute
warning, okay?

11:55.120 --> 11:58.928
- We have 15 minutes
to get this.
- Yeah.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.631
Man:
<i>Action.</i>

12:00.631 --> 12:02.300
We as women stand united.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.306
Demanding sexual respect,
today, tomorrow

12:05.306 --> 12:09.047
and for the rest
of our lives.

12:09.047 --> 12:11.218
- They seem happy.
- They're a little too happy.

12:11.218 --> 12:13.791
- Yeah. ( laughs )
- It's not a happy phrase.

12:13.791 --> 12:16.696
Man:
<i>Action.</i>

12:16.696 --> 12:16.963
My body, my choice,
his lucky day.

12:17.431 --> 12:21.071
Yes.

12:24.278 --> 12:28.820
Just because I like her,
doesn't mean I hate him.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.091
Can you space
it out a bit?

12:31.091 --> 12:32.327
"Just because
I like her... space,

12:32.327 --> 12:34.932
doesn't mean
I hate him ."

12:34.932 --> 12:36.101
Me and Tash have this
interesting dynamic.

12:36.101 --> 12:39.107
When she has
any issue with me,

12:39.107 --> 12:39.942
it feels like I'm being
scolded by my mom and it kills
me.

12:42.080 --> 12:46.455
Just because I like her...
doesn't mean I hate him.

12:46.455 --> 12:50.429
The last one was good.

12:50.429 --> 12:52.100
This is my thing, I've been
modeling a lot longer.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.739
<i>I feel like I'm a much
more confident model</i>

12:54.739 --> 12:56.776
and I felt like
I did a really good job.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.514
Pull your hair all
forward, India. Yep.

12:58.514 --> 13:02.020
Clothing doesn't hide
my sex appeal.

13:02.020 --> 13:03.122
I'm sexy with clothing...
and without.

13:04.926 --> 13:06.696
Ashley:
<i>You have seven minutes.</i>

13:09.301 --> 13:10.369
My mind is just
as sexy as my body.

13:15.179 --> 13:19.989
- Yes. Yes. And that's
exactly what is all about. -
Right?

13:19.989 --> 13:23.763
Who's gonna--
Who's gonna smash it?

13:23.763 --> 13:26.703
She's smashing it and we're
just-- stand on the mark.

13:26.703 --> 13:28.974
Ashley:
All right, guys.
3 minutes.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.210
Let's set
this glass up quick.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.378
- We're ready.
- Gotcha.

13:32.815 --> 13:33.215
Much better.

13:37.825 --> 13:39.194
Amber:
It's like, "We ain't takin'
no ( bleep ).

13:39.194 --> 13:41.566
You gotta
believe it.

13:41.566 --> 13:43.235
Paige:
Our video.
We knew was so good.

13:43.235 --> 13:45.574
Everybody was doing
such a great job.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.845
The energy was high,
so I'm like, positive
that we had it in the bag.

13:47.845 --> 13:50.216
I'm happy we did do
something that has to do
with, like, a good cause.

13:50.216 --> 13:53.824
- Yes.
- Something meaningful.

13:53.824 --> 13:55.260
Let's take a
look at their videos.

13:55.260 --> 13:56.997
- Yeah, let's see them.
- All right.

13:56.997 --> 13:58.465
Girls:
We as women, stand united.

13:58.465 --> 14:01.238
<i>Demanding sexual
respect...</i>

14:01.238 --> 14:02.908
It's all about
today's video.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.714
It was cute.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.050
We had good statements,
I think.

14:07.050 --> 14:09.855
I can't wait to see it,
I just wanna see it.

14:09.855 --> 14:11.058
Don't judge me. I'm not
walking down the street
for your entertainment.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.097
I'm just for
me not you.

14:14.097 --> 14:16.234
Girls:
<i>Don't judge us.</i>

14:16.234 --> 14:18.540
In my eyes, there's
no doubt that we won.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.877
<i>just because I was thinking
ofTatiana, Coryanne, and
Courtney</i>

14:20.877 --> 14:24.284
<i>all working together</i>

14:24.284 --> 14:25.554
and talking about something that
actually <i>means</i> something,

14:25.554 --> 14:29.328
has some depth to it.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.229
I was like, "Oh gosh, I
did not think they would do
well."

14:30.229 --> 14:34.271
We shall see.

14:34.271 --> 14:36.108
When you're a super model,
when you're a business woman,

14:36.108 --> 14:37.745
there has to be that
understanding of how to speak.

14:37.745 --> 14:39.782
Yes.
They did not get it.

14:40.951 --> 14:41.953
So, we did pick a winner.

14:46.461 --> 14:47.564
What is most important is
to actually know what you're
talking about.

14:47.564 --> 14:52.240
<i>So we picked...</i>

14:52.240 --> 14:52.440
I think today was
one of the weaker days.

14:54.912 --> 14:57.316
I don't hear
any, "Yes! Nice."

14:57.316 --> 14:57.918
Coryanne, everything
is a little limp noodle.

15:10.611 --> 15:15.386
Welcome back, ladies.

15:15.386 --> 15:17.423
Congratulations on your
PSA "Slut Walk" videos.

15:17.423 --> 15:20.496
<i>In one hour you both did a
really great job, all right?</i>

15:20.496 --> 15:22.801
But, we have critiques
for both of the groups.

15:22.801 --> 15:25.808
So, Group 1, you guys were
very confident walking in

15:25.808 --> 15:28.780
<i>and you knew exactly the
shots you wanted to do</i>

15:28.780 --> 15:32.453
but there was just
a lack of understanding

15:32.453 --> 15:34.959
what the "Slut Walk"
is really standing for.

15:34.959 --> 15:36.996
Tash, you said, "It's my
body, my choice, his lucky day."

15:38.634 --> 15:43.777
In "Slut Walk," we would say,
"It's my lucky day,"

15:43.777 --> 15:47.952
because it's about me and what
I wanna do as a sexual being.

15:47.952 --> 15:50.691
- <i>It has nothing
to do with any man...</i>
- Right.

15:50.691 --> 15:53.095
...or anybody else.

15:53.095 --> 15:54.498
Being back in the
competition, I felt a lot of
stress.

15:54.498 --> 15:58.105
After getting some criticism
from Amber,

15:58.105 --> 15:59.675
<i>just wanted to prove
to myself that I belonged
in the competition,</i>

15:59.675 --> 16:02.848
that I did my best,
because I just came back.

16:02.848 --> 16:05.654
Okay, so, Team 2.

16:05.654 --> 16:07.858
You guys actually had
the perfect wording.

16:07.858 --> 16:10.664
You did your research, you knew
<i>everything about "Slut
Walk,"</i>

16:10.664 --> 16:14.104
<i>but there was such
a lack of confidence.</i>

16:14.104 --> 16:17.110
Yeah, you guys
got everything right,

16:17.110 --> 16:19.114
If you had their confidence, it
would've came across way better.

16:19.114 --> 16:22.119
So, we did pick
a winner.

16:23.356 --> 16:24.457
What is most important
for the PSA

16:28.299 --> 16:30.136
is to actually know
what you're talking about.

16:30.136 --> 16:33.208
So, we picked Group 2.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.748
Ashley:
<i>Congratulations, guys.</i>

16:35.748 --> 16:38.385
So your PSA will be played
at the "Slut Walk"

16:38.385 --> 16:42.528
- in front of thousands
of women...
- Oh, my God.

16:42.528 --> 16:45.166
and your face will be plastered
up on there, so that's awesome.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.303
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- That's amazing. Woo.

16:47.303 --> 16:49.808
I'm excited
that we did win.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.647
It kinda proves even
though our energy was kinda low,

16:52.647 --> 16:54.651
we made everything relate to the
one message and I think that
Amber really appreciated that.

16:54.651 --> 16:59.027
Ashley:
All right, ladies.
Go home and get some rest

16:59.027 --> 17:01.398
<i>because tomorrow you have
another fierce photo shoot.</i>

17:01.398 --> 17:03.368
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

17:06.609 --> 17:10.750
Cody: <i>Not even
that tired anymore.</i>

17:10.750 --> 17:11.787
- I'm really just like...
- I know, that's the thing.

17:11.787 --> 17:15.360
I'm like, so over--

17:15.360 --> 17:17.397
there's so much stimulus
in my life currently.

17:17.397 --> 17:21.271
And I'm just exhausted
to the point of, like,

17:21.271 --> 17:23.744
not being able to comprehend
how exhausted I am.

17:23.744 --> 17:26.750
<i>Our video didn't end up
winning.</i>

17:26.750 --> 17:29.054
<i>I was, like, bummed
and a little stunned</i>

17:29.054 --> 17:30.791
because everything went so
well it's hard to come in
second.

17:30.791 --> 17:35.901
Second is the
first to lose

17:35.901 --> 17:38.105
and I'm trying to stay
positive about it but it was
definitely a bummer.

17:38.105 --> 17:40.710
<i>Every day I wake up
and I'm like,
"Am I gonna sink or swim?"</i>

17:40.710 --> 17:43.884
- Yeah.
- I have no idea whether
I'm safe today, gone tomorrow.

17:43.884 --> 17:47.991
- I'm like, "Uh."
- ( both laugh )

17:47.991 --> 17:49.596
<i>So tomorrow we have
a photo shoot
and I really wanna kill it</i>

17:49.596 --> 17:53.703
<i>I wanna knock
it out of the park</i>

17:53.703 --> 17:55.941
because the competition is
incredibly stiff right now.

17:55.941 --> 17:58.714
All the girls are beautiful and
they have great personalities so
it's definitely go-time.

17:58.714 --> 18:01.484
- I don't know, I think
we'll be okay this week.
- I think so.

18:16.148 --> 18:20.657
Paige:
<i>Walking into the studio</i>

18:20.657 --> 18:22.293
we see the beautiful
Ms. Stacey McKenzie.

18:22.293 --> 18:25.299
<i>She's a legend
in this industry.</i>

18:25.299 --> 18:27.838
- How are you ladies
doing? - Fine.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.608
So you know, how you guys are
all trying to be like,

18:29.608 --> 18:32.480
boss ladies
in this competition?

18:32.480 --> 18:34.084
Today you're going
to be embodying some
of the most iconic,

18:34.084 --> 18:37.591
right, boss ladies
in pop culture history.

18:37.591 --> 18:39.996
- Paige, you're gonna be
Britney Spears.
- ( screaming )

18:39.996 --> 18:42.768
Stacey:
<i>I can totally see that.</i>

18:42.768 --> 18:44.270
- Cody, you're gonna
be Grace Jones.
- Whoa.

18:44.270 --> 18:48.478
Stacey:
<i>Yes.</i>

18:48.478 --> 18:50.215
- Courtney, Madonna.
- ( screaming )

18:50.215 --> 18:51.819
- <i>Knew it! All right.</i>
- That is an icon.

18:51.819 --> 18:54.859
India.

18:54.859 --> 18:56.494
- Katy Perry.
- ( screaming )

18:56.494 --> 18:58.332
Stacey:
<i>Those eyes, oh, yeah.</i>

18:58.332 --> 19:00.537
- Tash, Tina Turner.
- Whoa.

19:00.537 --> 19:03.208
- Okay, Coryanne, Beyoncé.
- ( ovation )

19:05.179 --> 19:10.022
Tatiana, no pressure,
no pressure.

19:10.022 --> 19:12.460
- You're gonna be
embodying Tyra Banks.
- Whoa.

19:12.460 --> 19:16.536
The Tyra Banks,
the mother of this show,

19:16.536 --> 19:19.207
<i>the mother of everything</i>

19:19.207 --> 19:20.376
<i>and that kinda matches
my personality</i>

19:20.376 --> 19:22.047
because I'm the ruler
of everything also

19:22.047 --> 19:24.050
<i>and I learned how to model
through watching Top Model.</i>

19:24.050 --> 19:26.923
So, I'm just ready
to get it pumpin'.

19:26.923 --> 19:29.327
Okay, ladies, remember,
these are not impersonations.

19:29.327 --> 19:32.668
These are inspirations.
So bring yourself into this.

19:32.668 --> 19:35.874
Everything that
you've learned so far throughout
this competition,

19:35.874 --> 19:37.644
<i>your movement, your posing,
make sure you apply it,
okay?</i>

19:37.644 --> 19:40.149
- Remember that. Keep that
in mind. Go get boss.
- Woo!

19:45.660 --> 19:50.704
- Miss Thang, Miss T.
- Hey, how are you?

19:50.704 --> 19:52.941
- How are you?
'Cause you had to do Tyra.
- I'm good. I'm excited.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.212
- I'm gonna give
variation. - You gotta bring it
when it comes to Tyra.

19:55.212 --> 19:57.717
- Gonna keep cuttin' you
off, because it's Tyra. - I
know, I know.

19:57.717 --> 20:01.058
Stacey:
No pressure. All right,
what are we gonna do?

20:01.058 --> 20:03.428
She smiles a lot
so I'm just gonna make
sure I get my eyes down

20:03.428 --> 20:05.834
because I feel like when
you look at her the first thing
that you see is her eyes.

20:05.834 --> 20:09.942
This whole week has been
about female power

20:09.942 --> 20:12.080
and it's super cool
that we're gonna be embodying
female icons today.

20:12.080 --> 20:16.388
<i>But once the all the icons
were given to each of us</i>

20:16.388 --> 20:18.726
<i>I immediately was, like,
"Tyra would've been
the hardest one to embody.</i>

20:18.726 --> 20:23.068
<i>You would have so much
to live up to."</i>

20:23.068 --> 20:23.703
- All right, remember,
again, the, the model, Tyra, the
one. - Tyra.

20:26.575 --> 20:29.113
India:
<i>Best of luck, Tatiana.</i>

20:31.418 --> 20:32.419
For me this is
"you'll make it or break it."

20:35.226 --> 20:38.199
As someone who works
at a magazine,

20:38.199 --> 20:39.735
I don't know that
I would keep rebooking you

20:39.735 --> 20:41.037
'cause I'm gonna get
the same picture.

20:57.136 --> 21:00.342
Paige:
The purpose
of today's photoshoot

21:00.342 --> 21:02.781
is to have us girls start
seeing ourselves as women

21:02.781 --> 21:05.954
<i>with huge, massive influences
and what better way to do
that</i>

21:05.954 --> 21:08.660
then by channeling these mega
bosses themselves within
a photoshoot?

21:08.660 --> 21:12.601
Oh my gosh, Ms. Britney.

21:12.601 --> 21:15.173
Girl, I know you.

21:15.173 --> 21:17.778
What are you gonna
do with Ms. Britney?

21:17.778 --> 21:19.748
Since I was a little kid
I memorized all her songs,

21:19.748 --> 21:22.353
all her dance moves,
all of her choreography,
I'm so excited.

21:22.353 --> 21:25.159
That is so cool.
That means you're
on the right path my girl.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.363
- Yes.
- Remember that you're only
using her as inspiration.

21:27.363 --> 21:30.336
- Absolutely.
- All right,
so it's really about you.

21:30.336 --> 21:32.373
Totally, I'm gonna
channel in Britney today.

21:32.373 --> 21:34.377
- No, no, you'll channel
you, first and foremost.
- Yeah. Perfect.

21:34.377 --> 21:38.151
And bring, you know,
some of Britney in it.

21:38.151 --> 21:39.955
- You got it though.
I'm happy for you.
- Thank you, I'm excited.

21:39.955 --> 21:42.326
After seeing Stacey
and Amber Rose

21:42.326 --> 21:44.966
both be such incredible
lady bosses that aren't bitchy

21:44.966 --> 21:47.771
or anything but they're super
sweet and nice is really cool.

21:47.771 --> 21:50.108
It's a nice thing
to sort of aspire to.

21:53.850 --> 21:58.325
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi.

21:58.325 --> 22:01.832
How are you, guys?
I don't even recognize you.

22:01.832 --> 22:05.573
Now is go-time and I
warned the girls last week.

22:05.573 --> 22:09.849
You know, this is really
where the rubber hits the road

22:09.849 --> 22:11.686
and you've got to zoom in your
own direction and win this
competition.

22:11.686 --> 22:15.693
- All right, Material
Girl, are you ready? - Yes.

22:15.693 --> 22:17.898
This is your photographer,
Vijat Mohindra.

22:17.898 --> 22:20.169
Hi, I'm Courtney,
nice to meet you.

22:20.169 --> 22:21.972
Well, no,
I'm Madonna.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.012
So imagine you're bringing
something new to the character.

22:26.314 --> 22:30.490
All right, here we go.

22:30.490 --> 22:31.190
Yes.

22:34.030 --> 22:36.168
Courtney, with this character,
it's a little bit raunchier
and dirtier,

22:36.168 --> 22:39.407
- give me that editorial
back at the grocery store.
- Courtney: <i>Okay.</i>

22:39.407 --> 22:43.081
Drew:
<i>Careful that chin.</i>

22:46.220 --> 22:51.064
Tatiana:Courtney, I don't think
that she has the potential to
win this whole thing.

22:51.064 --> 22:51.598
And it's not even about
physical looks it's just about
her aura, the vibes that she
gives off.

22:53.368 --> 22:55.673
When you do the kick,
try to hold it.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.552
I'm gonna make sure I own
everything that I do.

23:01.552 --> 23:06.394
<i>Never accept
defeat and...</i>

23:06.394 --> 23:08.599
completely obliterate the idea
that Cody is better than me.

23:08.599 --> 23:12.741
Drew:
Tash, that first
to be honest is fabulous.

23:12.741 --> 23:15.045
<i>That's fab.</i>

23:15.045 --> 23:17.316
Ah! Even that's fab.

23:17.316 --> 23:17.416
There's a lot of pressure
in the competition right now

23:20.957 --> 23:23.062
<i>which is why having
my sister back it is really,
really hard for me.</i>

23:23.062 --> 23:25.399
Well, I am my own person
and I have to continue to focus
on one thing.

23:26.569 --> 23:31.111
Making my own path.

23:31.111 --> 23:32.648
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

23:32.648 --> 23:34.383
I wanna be in charge of
this, like, this is my thing.

23:34.383 --> 23:37.323
Drew:
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

23:37.323 --> 23:38.959
<i>Don't use your
brain in this, Cody.</i>

23:38.959 --> 23:41.732
Use your body.

23:41.732 --> 23:43.135
<i>She is from
another world.</i>

23:43.135 --> 23:45.507
Okay, Cody. So, like,
this isn't strong enough.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.813
The thing that's really
interesting about her is

23:48.813 --> 23:51.251
she gives you shapes
that you can't even imagine

23:51.251 --> 23:53.789
- <i>how she gets into.</i>
- Got ya.

23:53.789 --> 23:56.327
Courtney was like being
safe with the poses

23:56.327 --> 23:58.933
and it was so robotic too, it's
like, "Okay, I do this now."

23:58.933 --> 24:03.643
All right, Beyoncé, it's time.
You've done enough primping.

24:03.643 --> 24:08.184
Coryanne: It's intimidating
seeing Tash do so well
just because she's gone.

24:08.184 --> 24:11.190
She's been resting,
she has her full confidence,

24:11.190 --> 24:14.296
no one's been tearing
her down,

24:14.296 --> 24:15.432
I just wanna show them
that I'm listening and
I'm trying, you know.

24:15.432 --> 24:18.471
Get the wind.

24:18.471 --> 24:19.975
You're at the Super Bowl!
You're doing the half-time show!

24:19.975 --> 24:23.516
It's that big.

24:23.516 --> 24:25.654
Weave, weave.

24:25.654 --> 24:28.325
So, Coryanne, everything's
a little limp noodle.

24:28.325 --> 24:30.128
What makes her legendary
is every single thing
is choreographed

24:31.331 --> 24:35.807
and then executed perfectly.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.811
- Crisp. Got it.
- Yeah.

24:37.811 --> 24:38.445
So... end it.
Got it.

24:41.150 --> 24:43.188
Your legs are really weak.
Beyoncé never has a
weak leak, ever!

24:43.188 --> 24:48.332
<i>Coryanne,
she did not own it.</i>

24:48.332 --> 24:49.333
She wasn't strong.
Her Beyoncé was anything
but a queen.

24:49.333 --> 24:53.976
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

24:53.976 --> 24:55.580
- All right, let's go.
- Let's do it.

24:55.580 --> 24:56.347
Paige:
Training my whole life
for this this, Drew.

24:59.487 --> 25:02.259
- Paige, we're not doing
like a Vegas impersonation.
- ( laughter )

25:02.259 --> 25:06.501
- Got it.
- Imagine you're bringing
something new

25:06.501 --> 25:10.075
to the character.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.545
So as much as I wanted
to be Britney today,

25:11.545 --> 25:15.854
I have to remind myself
that I'm still a model

25:15.854 --> 25:18.191
and I had to just sort of keep
my modelesque figure
in front of the camera.

25:18.191 --> 25:22.333
Drew:
Paige, maybe
we can try a couple

25:22.333 --> 25:24.672
where it's like, this is the
12th award you've won tonight.

25:24.672 --> 25:26.274
And it's not like
you're over it but it's like,
"I know I'm the boss."

25:30.049 --> 25:30.616
Paige was doing a lot of
like, smiling, like, pageantry
moves.

25:34.892 --> 25:39.701
She wasn't really
getting it.

25:39.701 --> 25:41.371
I don't if it was because
she was uncomfortable with
what she was wearing

25:41.371 --> 25:45.379
<i>or if she doesn't know
how to not smile,</i>

25:45.379 --> 25:47.216
and I can tell that it was
kinda getting on Drew's nerves.

25:47.216 --> 25:50.857
You've won <i>every</i> award,
you've won <i>every</i> Grammy,

25:50.857 --> 25:53.929
you've won <i>every</i>
single thing.

25:53.929 --> 25:54.463
What do you think
of it, Vijat?

25:57.102 --> 25:59.074
A little variation
would be good.

25:59.074 --> 26:01.077
Drew:
Don't cover your face,
Paige.

26:01.077 --> 26:03.048
<i>With Paige,
I was hoping today</i>

26:03.048 --> 26:04.551
she'd be able to take
this character

26:04.551 --> 26:07.089
and bring something
new to it.

26:07.089 --> 26:08.759
And having just gone through
all of this women empowerment
in the challenge,

26:08.759 --> 26:13.803
I wanted her to really,
kinda like, bring that to this.

26:13.803 --> 26:15.105
It was hard to get her
out of her comfort zone of
being the rah-rah cheerleader.

26:16.642 --> 26:21.250
Think more iconic poses.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.921
Okay, I think that's good.
Yeah.

26:25.994 --> 26:30.436
- Great.
- Tatiana: I'm up against
some good models.

26:30.436 --> 26:34.443
<i>Like, India is gorgeous in
her photos and in her face.</i>

26:34.443 --> 26:35.245
But as far as the whole
package, I'm the one who's had
it from the beginning.

26:35.947 --> 26:40.122
Oh, fab.
Good.

26:40.122 --> 26:41.925
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

26:41.925 --> 26:44.430
India killed it.

26:44.430 --> 26:45.499
She played up all that cutesy,
fun, Katy Perry.

26:45.499 --> 26:48.606
She did an awesome job.

26:48.606 --> 26:49.507
Okay, now, Tatiana,
don't forget to smile.

26:49.507 --> 26:52.614
One, two, three.

26:54.483 --> 26:55.018
I know you wanna do the chin-up
because that's what she does

26:59.661 --> 27:01.766
but the wig can kind of look
draggy if you're not careful.

27:01.766 --> 27:06.107
Wait, hold on. I'm tryin'
to think of what else I had.

27:06.107 --> 27:09.213
Tyra is a model so when
she's on a red carpet

27:09.213 --> 27:10.950
or doing a editorial it's
not that much like pose, pose,
posy

27:10.950 --> 27:14.725
so I kinda ran out
of things to do.

27:14.725 --> 27:15.492
Careful that hair it--
looks biggy when you... go back.

27:17.162 --> 27:18.966
Let's do some of those
classic poses.

27:22.372 --> 27:23.107
I'm trying to keep
my chin down.

27:27.283 --> 27:28.652
Like, if we can get more
emotion in the face, too,

27:28.652 --> 27:31.526
to really, like,
portray the overall feeling.

27:31.526 --> 27:34.330
Drew:
<i>Tatiana had big shows
to fill.</i>

27:34.330 --> 27:36.134
I think today was
one of her weaker days.

27:36.134 --> 27:38.740
Really channel that
entrepreneurial mogul attitude.

27:38.740 --> 27:43.348
Tyra Banks is a very
powerful woman. She's very
successful

27:43.348 --> 27:46.689
and for me Tati was just kinda
posing like she was at her
senior prom.

27:46.689 --> 27:51.131
Vajit:
<i>A little stronger, honey.</i>

27:51.131 --> 27:52.534
Drew:
<i>Iconic!</i>

27:52.534 --> 27:54.638
Last one.

27:54.638 --> 27:55.305
That's it, it's a wrap!

27:59.581 --> 28:03.756
Oh, groceries.

28:03.756 --> 28:06.494
- India.
- What?

28:06.494 --> 28:08.365
- Great minds
think alike, I see.
- Mm-hmm.

28:08.365 --> 28:10.736
Tatiana:
Damn, who's been
eating my ice cream?

28:10.736 --> 28:12.874
- I did.
- Watch what you do.

28:12.874 --> 28:15.747
- Two spoonfuls of ice
cream. - I don't care if it
was--

28:15.747 --> 28:19.053
I don't care if it was
a dime-size bite I do not care.

28:19.053 --> 28:20.556
Ask me, it's mine. I paid
for it with my money therefore
it's mine. Don't touch it.

28:25.365 --> 28:30.777
What I'm saying is
that people's things
are their things.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.781
- You can't tell me
that you ate my stuff.
- After now, three days later

28:32.781 --> 28:34.216
- you're pissed off about it.
- No-- Because I just saw it.

28:34.216 --> 28:36.722
I did not know that
you ate my ice cream

28:36.722 --> 28:39.059
I thought that you were
kidding 'cause that's rude.

28:39.059 --> 28:41.632
Tatiana struggled at their
photo shoot and now she's trying
to attack Courtney.

28:41.632 --> 28:45.873
Tatiana:
Don't touch my stuff,
don't say anything to me.

28:45.873 --> 28:49.246
Courtney:
I'm not touching
your stuff, Tatiana.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.417
It's just ice cream, if you're
gonna make a big deal I'll buy
you a whole new pint

28:51.417 --> 28:53.421
- so you'll stop ( bleep ).
- Tatiana: <i>Please.</i>

28:53.421 --> 28:55.594
Courtney just has
a way about her

28:55.594 --> 28:57.196
that just makes people
angry with her.

28:57.196 --> 28:59.801
Literally I'm asking her
to not eat my food

28:59.801 --> 29:01.805
that I paid for
with my money.

29:01.805 --> 29:03.308
The fact that she's acting like
<i>she doesn't understand
that.</i>

29:03.308 --> 29:05.546
That's what's making me mad.

29:05.546 --> 29:05.746
Courtney:
<i>God, you're such a
( bleep ) bitch.</i>

29:20.241 --> 29:22.948
Hello, ladies.

29:22.948 --> 29:24.150
This week was all about being
socially responsible

29:24.150 --> 29:28.125
<i>using your voice
for a cause</i>

29:28.125 --> 29:29.894
and learning what is like
to be a real boss.

29:29.894 --> 29:33.301
Now, let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

29:33.301 --> 29:36.608
Gorgeous super model and
body activist, Ashley Graham.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.478
Our incredible creative
consultant and Chief Creative
Officer of "Paper" magazine,

29:38.478 --> 29:43.154
Drew Elliott.

29:43.154 --> 29:45.092
<i>Lou is styling Celine Dion
and will not be with us
today</i>

29:45.092 --> 29:46.026
but we have super model
and runway coach, Stacey
McKenzie filling in for him.

29:48.098 --> 29:49.868
The winner of
America's Next Top Model
will receive $100,000

29:53.007 --> 29:58.118
and be featured in a commercial
thanks to Rimmel London.

29:58.118 --> 30:00.155
In addition, the winner will
also be featured in a fashion
spread for "Paper" magazine.

30:00.155 --> 30:04.998
<i>And get an exclusive one-year
talent deal with VH1.</i>

30:04.998 --> 30:09.941
Throughout this competition,
we've told you

30:09.941 --> 30:11.110
America's Next Top Model
needs to embody the three B's:

30:12.647 --> 30:17.223
<i>business, boss,
and brand.</i>

30:17.223 --> 30:19.628
This week, you all got
to experience that firsthand

30:19.628 --> 30:22.132
<i>as you were all
asked to pose</i>

30:22.132 --> 30:23.670
as bona fide lady bosses.

30:23.670 --> 30:26.340
<i>Let's see how you did.</i>

30:26.340 --> 30:28.011
First up, Tash.

30:28.011 --> 30:30.348
- Welcome back.
- Thank you so much.

30:30.348 --> 30:33.155
- Well, you had Tina
Turner. - Yes.

30:33.155 --> 30:35.325
- Rita: <i>Let's have a look.</i>
- All:Wow.

30:35.325 --> 30:36.695
Drew:
<i>It's fab.</i>

30:36.695 --> 30:38.832
Holy ma-joly.

30:38.832 --> 30:40.837
Rita:
This is in motion, you know, I
live for it in motion picture.

30:40.837 --> 30:42.740
- Stacey: <i>What?</i>
- Ashley:This is amazing.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.010
Rita:
<i>Your face looks tight,</i>

30:44.010 --> 30:45.546
<i>the sweatiness works
in your favor.</i>

30:45.546 --> 30:47.651
I was worried about you
coming back in the house,

30:47.651 --> 30:49.253
<i>like, not having had as much
experience as the other
girls.</i>

30:49.253 --> 30:52.359
This shows that maybe you don't
need as much experience.

30:52.359 --> 30:54.363
- <i>Maybe you just have it.</i>
- I didn't say it. She said
it.

30:54.363 --> 30:57.904
( laughing )

30:57.904 --> 31:00.041
That's the party girl
that I need to be pictured with,

31:00.041 --> 31:02.412
<i>and be friends with
'causeshe's looking like she's
having a great time.</i>

31:02.412 --> 31:04.585
- Ashley: <i>Yes.</i> - Rita:
And for me those are great
attributes

31:04.585 --> 31:06.888
to being a boss.
You know what I'm saying,
controlling a room.

31:06.888 --> 31:08.125
And you look like
you controlled this.

31:08.125 --> 31:10.262
You came back hungry

31:10.262 --> 31:11.766
and passionate about being
in this competition
and gettin' it.

31:11.766 --> 31:14.069
<i>You should be proud
of yourself.</i>

31:14.069 --> 31:15.405
I've seen models, like,
pretty much get

31:15.405 --> 31:17.711
kicked to the curb
like they're dirt.

31:17.711 --> 31:20.015
You know what I mean,
and they don't get opportunities
to come back... like that.

31:20.015 --> 31:23.021
- Keep that drive up.
- Rita: Thank you very much,
Tash.

31:23.021 --> 31:25.860
Next up, Coryanne.

31:25.860 --> 31:28.899
You got given Beyoncé.

31:28.899 --> 31:30.937
- Ashley: <i>The queen.</i>
- Rita: What I love about
Beyoncé is that she is strong,

31:30.937 --> 31:35.278
she has an opinion and that
for me should've been enough

31:35.278 --> 31:38.586
to inspire you and I don't know
where the confidence has gone.

31:38.586 --> 31:41.926
<i>This compared to last week is
like, two different people.</i>

31:41.926 --> 31:45.064
I wish I would've exaggerated
my body more.

31:45.064 --> 31:47.202
Like, I wish I would've
been more like Beyoncé.
You know what I mean?

31:47.202 --> 31:49.775
You weren't bringing
anything on this day.

31:49.775 --> 31:52.747
<i>You heard me, I was like,</i>

31:52.747 --> 31:53.750
"Stronger," and I kept trying
to bring that out of you

31:53.750 --> 31:56.822
<i>I didn't get it here.</i>

31:56.822 --> 31:59.259
He gave you a lot of
opportunities,

31:59.259 --> 32:01.464
a lot of frames
to work with.

32:01.464 --> 32:03.268
Whenever you get the chance
to be in front of a photographer

32:03.268 --> 32:05.773
and he's giving you
directions, listen, run with it,
okay,

32:05.773 --> 32:09.814
because usually
they don't give directions.

32:09.814 --> 32:11.685
You gotta come and you
gotta bring it from the gut.

32:11.685 --> 32:15.091
- I understand.
- Up next, Cody.

32:15.091 --> 32:17.429
- So you were asked
to pose as Grace Jones.
- Yes.

32:17.429 --> 32:20.135
Let's take a look.

32:20.135 --> 32:21.070
( <i>Ashley gasps</i> )

32:21.070 --> 32:23.441
<i>Wow.</i>

32:23.441 --> 32:25.178
<i>It literally looks
so powerful.</i>

32:25.178 --> 32:28.251
Obviously the contrast of black
suit with the white background

32:28.251 --> 32:30.322
shows some form
of independence, etc,
and your face looks gorgeous.

32:30.322 --> 32:34.631
- You know I'm a big fan
of Grace Jones.
- I know.

32:34.631 --> 32:36.100
She's like, my idol.
And backstage you were like,
killing it,

32:36.100 --> 32:39.974
you were givin' me nothin'
but Grace.

32:39.974 --> 32:41.310
All right but then when
you got in front of the camera

32:41.310 --> 32:43.281
<i>you were like, doing
these robotic poses.</i>

32:43.281 --> 32:45.653
Ashley: <i>You've
taken better photos.</i>

32:45.653 --> 32:47.724
I don't want your sister
being back in the house

32:47.724 --> 32:50.863
to prohibit you
from being you.

32:50.863 --> 32:54.136
I know you love her
and she loves you

32:54.136 --> 32:56.140
but at the end of the day
it's really a competition.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.648
I just want you to focus
on your career

32:59.648 --> 33:02.386
and not the both
of yours career.

33:02.386 --> 33:04.958
- Okay.
- Next up, Courtney.

33:04.958 --> 33:07.964
You've been in the bottom 2,
two weeks in a row.

33:07.964 --> 33:09.634
- I have.
- For me, this is
"you'll make it or break it."

33:09.634 --> 33:12.974
- <i>Let's have a look.</i>
- Ashley: Wow.

33:12.974 --> 33:15.379
<i>I'm just in awe
to be honest.</i>

33:15.379 --> 33:16.915
<i>I mean, Courtney, your
features are the truth.</i>

33:16.915 --> 33:18.819
- I love the photo.
- Thank you.

33:18.819 --> 33:21.023
Your face is amazing,
this is gorgeous.

33:21.023 --> 33:23.394
This one didn't get it for me,
your face wasn't there,

33:23.394 --> 33:25.566
you weren't there and I was
giving you lots of directions

33:25.566 --> 33:29.339
and I can never
get you to do it.

33:29.339 --> 33:30.543
- Well, thank you,
Courtney. - Thank you.

33:30.543 --> 33:33.482
Paige.

33:33.482 --> 33:35.185
We gave you Britney.

33:35.185 --> 33:36.822
Ashley:
I think this
is an incredible photo

33:36.822 --> 33:38.826
even though you're standing
behind the stand

33:38.826 --> 33:40.830
<i>you're owning it
with your body.</i>

33:40.830 --> 33:42.266
The confidence, I mean,
that's your award.

33:42.266 --> 33:45.940
Drew:
Your body looks perfect
and fantastic.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.610
It always does.
But I feel that what
I'm getting from you

33:47.610 --> 33:52.553
is "real estate agent headshot."

33:52.553 --> 33:55.091
I don't love your face in this.
I've seen this character from
you every single time.

33:55.091 --> 33:59.534
<i>As someone who works at a
magazine, I don't knowthat I
would keep rebooking you</i>

33:59.534 --> 34:03.609
'cause I'm gonna get
the same picture.

34:03.609 --> 34:07.015
I completely understand
Drew's point of view.

34:07.015 --> 34:10.288
<i>I just didn't see
that power moment,</i>

34:10.288 --> 34:12.860
<i>I was looking for
that moment where I thought,
"That's a boss."</i>

34:12.860 --> 34:15.065
You have this tendency of like,
doing this little pout thing

34:15.065 --> 34:17.937
like sucking the nose...

34:17.937 --> 34:19.439
- There, ooh, cut it.
- Ashley: <i>Oh, there it is.</i>

34:19.439 --> 34:21.645
Bad habit, gotta break it.

34:21.645 --> 34:22.580
- Thank you, Paige.
- Thank you so much.

34:22.580 --> 34:26.120
India.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.256
- Hello.
- Hi.

34:27.256 --> 34:28.792
We gave you Katy Perry.

34:28.792 --> 34:31.096
Panel:
<i>Ooh.</i>

34:31.096 --> 34:32.767
This looks like it could
be like a Rimmel ad.

34:32.767 --> 34:35.739
- Stacey: <i>Yes.</i> -
Rita:I'm not even kidding.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.076
- <i>I mean, your face is life.</i>
- Stacey: Yes.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.882
And I think giving
you Katy was great.

34:39.882 --> 34:42.721
- <i>You see color.</i>
- Yeah, I think so.

34:42.721 --> 34:44.758
What's amazing about you
is your face is like a light

34:44.758 --> 34:47.930
<i>and it's immediately
we're attracted to it.</i>

34:47.930 --> 34:49.934
<i>One thing that I really want
you to think about is the
positioning of your body.</i>

34:49.934 --> 34:55.278
because you often do very
unflattering poses to your body.

34:55.278 --> 34:57.951
- Stacey: <i>You have it goin'
on.</i> - Rita: You should be
very proud of this photograph.

34:57.951 --> 35:01.290
- Thank you, India.
- Thank you, guys.

35:01.290 --> 35:04.230
Up next, Tatiana.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.900
We gave you not only somebody
who is an incredible super model

35:05.900 --> 35:09.774
we also gave you someone
who is the creator of this show,

35:09.774 --> 35:13.114
<i>Ms. Tyra herself.
Let's have a look.</i>

35:13.114 --> 35:14.918
- <i>This was a red carpet
moment, correct?</i>
- Yes.

35:14.918 --> 35:18.859
Rita:
So even though
it's a photo shoot,

35:18.859 --> 35:20.930
I really wish you would've
pretended like you were there on
a red carpet with 20 paparazzis

35:20.930 --> 35:25.271
<i>in front of you to show
the fun side that Tyra has.</i>

35:25.271 --> 35:28.278
- Mm-hmm. - Ashley: <i>For me,
this photo,</i>

35:28.278 --> 35:30.683
is not the beauty that
Tyra really brings in the face.

35:30.683 --> 35:33.822
- Tatiana: <i>Yeah.</i>
- And also the body
is not there yet.

35:33.822 --> 35:36.962
- Right.
- And I believe
you're coasting right now.

35:36.962 --> 35:38.999
I believe that Tatiana
she's a boss, she's a brand,
she's a busines woman,

35:41.003 --> 35:45.646
<i>but what more can we see
from Tati?</i>

35:45.646 --> 35:47.482
<i>I wanna see
that next level.</i>

35:47.482 --> 35:49.821
Do not get comfortable.

35:49.821 --> 35:51.290
Like, for me, you got a little
comfortable in this.

35:51.290 --> 35:53.394
<i>You were just like,
laid back with it.</i>

35:53.394 --> 35:54.964
Ashley:
I think you should get naked
in front of the mirror

35:54.964 --> 35:57.302
and start whipping
your hair around

35:57.302 --> 35:58.672
because I think that's what's
missing in your photos.

35:58.672 --> 36:01.244
It's that little crazy,
but like--

36:01.244 --> 36:03.214
- Yeah, the quirkiness
of a Tyra.
- That's what I do.

36:03.214 --> 36:06.320
- Get naked and then just
move the hair around, sista.
- Will do.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.859
- Just-- Yes!
- Okay, of course,thank you
so much for your criticism,

36:08.859 --> 36:11.665
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

36:11.665 --> 36:14.203
Okay, ladies, you know
how this goes,

36:14.203 --> 36:16.074
we now have a chat and we decide
who gets best photo

36:16.074 --> 36:18.845
and who is packing up
their bags and leaving.

36:35.513 --> 36:38.853
We have seven left.
It's getting tough.

36:38.853 --> 36:41.625
So let's start off
with Tash.

36:41.625 --> 36:43.996
- Ah!
- I love her face.

36:43.996 --> 36:46.434
She was just like,
"I'm going in for the kill."

36:46.434 --> 36:49.039
She brought the A-game
and it showed in the picture,

36:49.039 --> 36:51.912
in her attitude and
how she's moving forward.

36:51.912 --> 36:54.751
Let's talk about India,
Katy Perry.

36:54.751 --> 36:57.422
- Wow.
- I mean, wasn't
that incredible?

36:57.422 --> 36:59.292
- That was amazing.
- Drewy: I mean, I actually
have to say.

36:59.292 --> 37:01.463
She's beautiful,
she delivers,
and I love her.

37:01.463 --> 37:05.539
Rita: <i>It's her best photo.I
can't decide between the
two.</i>

37:05.539 --> 37:07.476
- Ashley: <i>Yes.</i>
- So what do we think
about Paige?

37:07.476 --> 37:10.148
<i>She had Britney Spears.</i>

37:10.148 --> 37:11.718
I liked her photo,
I think the problem is

37:11.718 --> 37:14.122
we have to look at the body
of work, right?

37:14.122 --> 37:16.226
Right. So her body of work
is this: Same, same, same.

37:16.226 --> 37:19.801
Ashley:
<i>She has not excelled.</i>

37:19.801 --> 37:21.605
Rita: <i>Coryanne,
she had Beyoncé.</i>

37:21.605 --> 37:23.307
- I am so disappointed
in Coryanne.
- I was like, "Beyoncé? Hello."

37:23.307 --> 37:27.617
That was the opportunity
to let her personality come out.

37:27.617 --> 37:31.124
What are we thinking
about Tatiana?

37:31.124 --> 37:33.427
- She did not deliver.
- Terribly upsetting,

37:33.427 --> 37:36.333
You know what it is?
These girls are getting
comfortable.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.839
- True.
- You always have
to bring it up a notch.

37:38.839 --> 37:41.009
I don't think that
this was her best day

37:41.009 --> 37:43.081
but I think out
of all the girls,

37:43.081 --> 37:44.684
there's just something
about her that screams model.

37:44.684 --> 37:47.690
Do you think
we've made a decision?

37:47.690 --> 37:48.925
- I think so.
- Oh, yeah.

37:54.670 --> 37:59.012
Rita:
<i>Models, welcome back.</i>

37:59.012 --> 38:01.518
The judges have deliberated.

38:01.518 --> 38:03.688
<i>If I call your name, you will
be staying another week</i>

38:03.688 --> 38:06.293
to prove you have what it
takes to be the next top model.

38:09.165 --> 38:09.800
For best picture this week...

38:13.474 --> 38:15.879
it's a tie.

38:17.616 --> 38:22.292
<i>Tash and India.</i>

38:22.292 --> 38:22.860
<i>Congratulations
on those photos.</i>

38:25.298 --> 38:25.999
The next name
I'm gonna call is...

38:29.206 --> 38:31.644
Cody.

38:32.379 --> 38:32.813
Courtney.

38:37.055 --> 38:37.221
<i>Two pictures left.</i>

38:41.865 --> 38:43.802
<i>The next name
I'm gonna call is...</i>

38:43.802 --> 38:44.235
- <i>Tatiana.</i>
- Thank you.

38:49.814 --> 38:54.758
Will Coryanne and Paige,
please step forward.

38:54.758 --> 38:55.726
The competition is more than
the picture before us today.

38:59.199 --> 39:03.074
It's about your body of work.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.411
<i>Paige, your energy
is contagious.</i>

39:05.411 --> 39:08.051
You light up a room
when you come on set.

39:08.051 --> 39:10.188
<i>You've proven yourself
as one of the best</i>

39:10.188 --> 39:13.260
when it comes
to moving video

39:13.260 --> 39:15.265
but the judges think
your photos are one note.

39:15.265 --> 39:19.273
Coryanne, week after
week after week,

39:19.273 --> 39:22.245
<i>you deliver strong,
beautiful photos.</i>

39:22.245 --> 39:25.919
But lately, you don't seem
to be progressing

39:25.919 --> 39:29.460
and not bringing the
energy to set that a boss needs.

39:29.460 --> 39:32.834
<i>The judges think that
they may have already seen
the best of you.</i>

39:32.834 --> 39:34.369
So, who stays in
this competition?

39:39.446 --> 39:43.588
Congratulations...

39:43.588 --> 39:45.124
<i>Coryanne.</i>

39:49.265 --> 39:54.209
You have made
it one more week.

39:54.209 --> 39:56.113
Please go and join
the other girls, thank you.

39:56.113 --> 39:57.281
Paige... Paige, Paige,
Paige, Paige, Paige.

39:59.486 --> 40:03.829
This isn't the
end for you.

40:03.829 --> 40:04.930
You have brought so much
light to this competition.

40:04.930 --> 40:07.703
Your personality just radiates.

40:07.703 --> 40:10.241
- Okay?
- Okay.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.078
- Okay?
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.

40:12.078 --> 40:16.153
I was shocked. I've never
been in the bottom two.

40:16.153 --> 40:19.660
And the thing
that hurts the most is...

40:19.660 --> 40:21.396
I've been trying
really hard

40:21.396 --> 40:23.267
<i>and I felt like I had
a good photo this week.</i>

40:23.267 --> 40:26.642
<i>I have no regrets.
I'm so thankful</i>

40:26.642 --> 40:29.948
<i>to have been here
and to have done this</i>

40:29.948 --> 40:32.519
<i>and to meet the girls
that I've met.</i>

40:32.519 --> 40:34.857
To my fellow contestants,
you're all wonderful people

40:34.857 --> 40:37.663
so thank your for
becoming a part of my life.

40:39.133 --> 40:40.969
All right, girls.
The final six.

40:43.508 --> 40:46.614
<i>This is serious.</i>

40:46.614 --> 40:48.017
This is when the competition
goes to a whole 'nother level.

40:48.017 --> 40:50.689
You'd better step up
your game.

40:58.371 --> 41:03.481
You are all gonna
experience a day in my life.

41:03.481 --> 41:07.690
- A day in her life, guys.
- Are the paparazzi downstairs?

41:07.690 --> 41:10.128
They're literally
everywhere.

41:10.128 --> 41:13.001
It's like a wall
of people.

41:13.001 --> 41:14.504
Your worst day could
be their best day.

41:14.504 --> 41:17.877
Today, we are going to
shoot a "Paper" magazine cover.

41:17.877 --> 41:22.018
Stop, see, like,
just shut the ( bleep ) up.

41:22.018 --> 41:24.958
- What the ( bleep )?
- Shut up.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.126
I don't know if this
"Paper" magazine maybe "National
Geographic."

41:31.504 --> 41:35.077
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
