♪ ♪

00:29.112 --> 00:31.698
WOMAN:
The truth is out there,
and they can't hide up

00:31.740 --> 00:33.992
in their ivory tower anymore.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.368
The Charmed Ones
aren't the heroes

00:35.410 --> 00:37.370
we were promised.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.372
Everywhere they go,
an innocent creature

00:39.414 --> 00:41.416
ends up getting killed.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.709
Are they really...

00:42.751 --> 00:44.669
Gonna leave the house today?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.296
What's the point?

00:46.337 --> 00:47.922
...using their powers
to control the rest of us.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.841
That ogre friend of yours,
Louie...

00:49.883 --> 00:51.634
He's a gnome.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.220
I don't care what he is.

00:54.262 --> 00:57.807
He said they might be
hiring at his shop.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.017
(sighs)

00:59.059 --> 01:00.769
Hon,

01:00.810 --> 01:03.354
I get you're upset.

01:03.396 --> 01:07.108
That spa paid good money, but...

01:07.150 --> 01:09.235
you got to find
another job eventually.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.113
TROLL:
Assuming this new girl
even is a Charmed One,

01:12.155 --> 01:13.448
they're the most powerful...

01:13.490 --> 01:16.576
Fine. I'll see you tonight.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.870
But where are they
when this Tallyman

01:18.912 --> 01:21.748
is wreaking havoc
on our world, huh?

01:21.790 --> 01:24.084
Oh, I'm gonna tell you where.

01:24.125 --> 01:28.004
At some fancy-pants spa!
That's where.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.423
And that ticks me off!

01:30.465 --> 01:32.967
People in power call us
"conspiracy theorists"

01:33.009 --> 01:34.260
because they're afraid.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.637
And they know that
we know truth,

01:35.678 --> 01:38.139
and that's terrifying
to them.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.725
WOMAN:
My kids haven't been able
to sleep in weeks.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.520
Not with this Tallyman
on the loose.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.522
Who's fighting for us
now that the witches

01:45.563 --> 01:46.940
have turned their backs on us?

01:48.233 --> 01:49.484
LORETTA:
Would you just

01:49.526 --> 01:50.985
put that thing down, please?

01:51.027 --> 01:53.238
WOMAN 2:
But who will it be?

01:53.279 --> 01:54.614
Who's got what it takes

01:54.656 --> 01:56.908
to stand up and fight
for our freedom?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.451
MAN:
They forced that leprechaun
guy to help them find

01:58.493 --> 01:59.953
the mysterious Tallyman

01:59.994 --> 02:02.080
and once he was no longer
useful, they tossed him.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.249
Come on, Donnie.
For God's sake,

02:04.290 --> 02:05.834
get off the couch already!

02:05.875 --> 02:07.794
Don't you see what
this is doing to us?

02:07.836 --> 02:10.463
Aah!

02:10.505 --> 02:12.298
WOMAN 3:
And you know M
is a cursed letter, right?

02:12.340 --> 02:15.093
Mags, Mel, Michaela?

02:15.135 --> 02:17.554
Think about it. Everyone knows
you can see an M...

02:17.595 --> 02:19.097
I'm leaving, Donnie.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.640
That damned thing
is poisoning your mind,

02:20.682 --> 02:23.893
and I don't want to be
a part of it anymore.

02:23.935 --> 02:28.231
Well?
Are you gonna say anything?

02:28.273 --> 02:30.191
MAN 2:
What makes them so damn special?

02:30.233 --> 02:32.318
I mean, they get replaced
faster than a revolving door.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.696
I bet they aren't even sisters.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.865
If you had any idea

02:36.906 --> 02:40.577
what those Charmed Ones
were really up to...

02:40.618 --> 02:43.163
(Loretta whimpers)

02:45.790 --> 02:47.500
Goodbye, Donnie.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.295
MAN:
I heard the Charmed Ones
were the cause

02:50.336 --> 02:51.963
of the rising gas prices.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.631
WOMAN:
They've got to be stopped

02:53.673 --> 02:57.969
before someone else gets hurt,
or worse.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.030
I hope you're ready to go
where no sandwich

03:17.071 --> 03:20.450
has gone before: back in time.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.583
(chuckles)

03:28.625 --> 03:30.376
Now let's go find you.

03:33.963 --> 03:36.424
(clock ticking)

03:36.466 --> 03:38.760
Why won't you stop?

03:40.428 --> 03:42.555
(exhales sharply)

03:46.476 --> 03:48.686
(gasps)

03:48.728 --> 03:50.647
(laughs)

03:50.688 --> 03:52.732
Hell yeah.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.969
Hey.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.971
Hey.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.807
What you been up to?
How have you been?
I am just...

04:26.766 --> 04:28.184
You go.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.979
Remember how I told you
I was volunteering

04:31.020 --> 04:33.356
at a shelter for queer teens
who end up homeless?

04:33.398 --> 04:34.524
Yeah.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.317
Well, it got shut down.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.069
What?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.779
City council marked it
for rezoning,

04:39.821 --> 04:42.490
and so we decided to take
matters into our own hands

04:42.532 --> 04:43.908
and set up a temp shelter here.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.578
We?
SWAN: Hey, Mel.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.461
Oh.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.298
Wow. Okay.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.340
So you two are...

04:59.382 --> 05:02.802
For the last couple months.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.387
I-I thought about, um,
telling you earlier,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.055
I just, the...

05:06.097 --> 05:09.100
timing didn't feel right.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.852
Oh.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.104
We could use another set of
hands if you want to help.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.566
Actually, I got to run.
But, um, congrats, you guys.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.444
This is great. Really.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.165
You okay?

05:32.206 --> 05:35.501
You are not going to believe

05:35.543 --> 05:37.128
who Ruby is dating.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.921
Kristen Stewart.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.632
Weirdly, that would have been
easier to swallow, but no.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.176
She's with Swan.

05:43.217 --> 05:46.346
Whoa. Plot twist.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.764
Right?

05:47.805 --> 05:50.308
I mean, Swan is great,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.894
and they oddly make
a ton of sense together,

05:52.935 --> 05:55.480
but I couldn't get out
of there fast enough.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.899
I'm sorry.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.692
A little light reading?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.861
Can't stop thinking
about the Tallyman.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.781
Those gross hands
massaging my scalp.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.866
Then I realized

06:06.908 --> 06:09.285
the only way he could have known
we were going to that spa

06:09.327 --> 06:11.496
was if he was listening
to us, here.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.999
That's when I found this.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.757
Look at its eyes.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.968
There's something almost
technological about them.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.721
Hmm.
Like cameras.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.306
Is it still watching us?

06:30.348 --> 06:34.060
No. I enchanted the jar
so we can see in, but...

06:34.102 --> 06:36.187
it can't see out.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.981
The problem is I've looked
through every book we own,

06:39.023 --> 06:41.359
and there's nothing on
surveillance spiders.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.610
Have you talked to Harry?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.487
He might know something
about it.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.949
Yeah, I called him,
but no answer.

06:47.990 --> 06:50.284
Have you seen him around lately?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.870
No. Actually,
I can't even tell you

06:52.912 --> 06:54.288
the last time I saw him.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.665
You don't think
anything's wrong, do you?

06:55.706 --> 07:00.420
No. I'm sure he's fine.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.255
Kaela was out with him
not too long ago.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.257
She might know where he is.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.720
Kaela?
(low buzzing hum)

07:09.762 --> 07:12.348
Do you hear that buzzing?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.350
Electric toothbrush?

07:14.392 --> 07:15.810
(buzzing grows louder)

07:15.852 --> 07:18.438
(Maggie gasps)
KAELA: Aah!

07:18.479 --> 07:20.857
It's not a toothbrush.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.069
KAELA:
Hey. Sorry.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.739
I, um... I usually lock it
when I'm...

07:28.781 --> 07:29.907
Brushing your teeth?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.285
Yeah. (laughs)
Yeah, sorry.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.787
It's just, uh, with these powers
making my art so dangerous,

07:34.829 --> 07:37.248
I've been too scared to paint.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.333
I'm afraid I'll, like,
bring a dragon to life

07:39.375 --> 07:41.169
that burns down Seattle, so...

07:41.210 --> 07:43.129
Yeah, that's probably not
a good idea.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.547
Yeah, no.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.923
But damn, when I can't paint
I get all

07:45.965 --> 07:47.675
bottled up inside, you know?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.927
So I got to...
There's a magic spider
in the house.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.347
Huh?
Uh, yeah.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.684
We think the Tallyman
is using it to spy on us.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.603
Oh.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.188
Have you seen Harry lately?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.648
Last I saw him he was
at the Blue Camellia

08:02.690 --> 08:04.108
going up to Roxie's office.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.694
But that was, like, a week ago.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.655
Sounds like we owe
our girl Roxie a visit.
Okay.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.867
Well, I'll come. Let me just
get some shoes on, yeah?

08:16.245 --> 08:18.623
Since when are you so awkward
about that stuff?

08:18.664 --> 08:20.875
I'm not being awkward.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.877
"There's a magic spider
in the house."

08:22.919 --> 08:25.505
Oh, excuse me for not wanting
to talk about masturbation

08:25.546 --> 08:27.215
with someone I barely know.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.217
Okay, but you do realize
the Power of Three is working,

08:29.258 --> 08:31.302
so she's probably our sister.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.095
Yes, Mel, I get that.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.890
But... I'm not ready to start

08:35.932 --> 08:38.351
throwing around
the "S" word yet.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.394
Not until I know for sure.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.189
(upbeat music playing)

08:43.231 --> 08:45.775
Really?
You're gonna raise twice

08:45.816 --> 08:48.528
and then put down a Zamba Zaraa?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.988
Got to say we expected
more from someone...

08:51.030 --> 08:54.075
who spends all that time
with the Charmed Ones.

08:54.116 --> 08:57.411
I told y'all I've never
played this game before.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.539
Now, can we please just
focus on Elvin Poker

08:59.580 --> 09:02.750
and not... the Witches Three?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.503
BOTH:
You mean the girlfriend
you're not talking to?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.421
(both laugh)

09:11.801 --> 09:13.427
Ugh.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.680
You got to be kidding me.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.640
(knock on door)
I know. Right? Come in!

09:17.682 --> 09:19.392
Every time they have a problem
they feel the need to

09:19.433 --> 09:21.602
take time out of my day
to solve it.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.063
It's these new generations.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.232
They just expect everything
handed to them

09:26.274 --> 09:30.486
instead of doing the work and
picking up a book themselves.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.113
Yeah, I'll take care of 'em.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.365
I haven't seen Harry.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.075
Wait, how did you...

09:36.117 --> 09:38.869
It's my bar. If anyone so much
as sneezes wrong, I know.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.663
(deep demonic voice)
Put that down!

09:42.123 --> 09:44.000
I'm sorry.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.253
I didn't know your voice
could do that.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.089
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.218
Wow.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.679
I love this piece.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.639
The style looks so familiar.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.770
Do you know who painted this?

10:04.812 --> 10:09.066
No idea, but my wife
loved their work.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.402
Had me hang another one
just like it downstairs.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.070
Hmm.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.031
(crashing in distance)
(screaming, heavy footsteps)

10:15.072 --> 10:17.867
(glass shattering)

10:25.916 --> 10:27.168
(screams continue)

10:29.420 --> 10:32.715
I know the Charmed Ones
are here, hiding!

10:32.757 --> 10:35.718
Looking out for themselves,
like they always do.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.513
So they can either come out
and face justice

10:39.555 --> 10:43.434
for what they've done
or, in 30 minutes,

10:43.476 --> 10:46.187
I'll make sure this bar
and every creature in it

10:46.228 --> 10:49.315
goes up in flames.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.818
(people shrieking)

10:52.860 --> 10:54.904
We have to get down there
before he hurts someone else.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.697
I can't let you do that.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.868
It's kind of our job.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.870
You use any sort
of magic on him,

11:02.912 --> 11:04.205
including your precious
Power of Three,

11:04.246 --> 11:05.289
and we're all gonna die.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.582
Those crystals in his gloves,

11:06.624 --> 11:09.335
it's called Annihilation Quartz.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.795
Tell me you've heard of it.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.129
Uh...

11:12.171 --> 11:15.383
Right.
Then I'll keep this simple.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.927
Now that it's activated,
if he claps his hands together,

11:17.968 --> 11:19.345
we all blow up.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.597
You use your powers
or a spell on him,

11:21.639 --> 11:23.599
the magic bounces back on you
and we all blow up.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.143
But then, if we do nothing,
in half an hour...

11:26.185 --> 11:28.020
We all blow up.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.689
In the old days,

11:29.730 --> 11:31.399
I would have just doused him
with Egyptian nightshade.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.818
It's all natural, so it
wouldn't trigger the quartz.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.986
But we haven't
carried that in ages.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.949
What if we could
go back in time?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.909
Take him down the second
he enters the bar,

11:41.951 --> 11:45.204
before he activates the quartz?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.664
Is that something we do?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.958
No. No, it's not.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.587
Actually, I've been
experimenting.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.297
On what?

11:55.339 --> 11:56.882
A turkey sandwich.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.551
You've been time travelling
a turkey sandwich?

11:58.592 --> 11:59.802
I can't be the one who goes,

11:59.844 --> 12:01.554
but I can send you two.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.930
Just ten minutes
back in time.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.640
You can kick this guy's ass.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.435
As long as I know when
and where you are,

12:07.476 --> 12:09.353
I can peer back
through time

12:09.395 --> 12:12.440
to that exact place and moment,
and when I touch you,

12:12.481 --> 12:15.735
it'll pull you back
into the present.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.570
Wait, are you actually
considering

12:17.611 --> 12:18.946
this cockamamie plan?

12:18.988 --> 12:20.614
What other choice do we have?

12:20.656 --> 12:22.408
I think it sounds
kind of fun.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.662
Okay, just do it before
I change my mind.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.750
Remember, do not leave the bar,

12:30.791 --> 12:32.251
or I won't be able
to find you.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.961
Okay.

12:34.003 --> 12:38.340
Don't worry. I got this.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.322
(alarmed chatter)

13:04.241 --> 13:06.243
(crystals pulsating)

13:08.788 --> 13:11.707
(electrical zap)
(grunts)

13:11.749 --> 13:13.709
(gasps)

13:16.170 --> 13:17.421
They're not there.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.131
You mean your ridiculous
time travel plan

13:19.173 --> 13:20.257
went dangerously awry?

13:20.299 --> 13:23.260
Where the hell did I send them?

13:23.302 --> 13:26.388
(jazz music playing)

13:26.430 --> 13:28.140
Where the hell
did she send us?

13:29.975 --> 13:31.644
Oh, yeah.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.979
(indistinct chatter)

13:39.026 --> 13:40.236
Excuse me.

13:40.277 --> 13:43.072
Could you tell us
what year it is?

13:43.113 --> 13:44.657
Same year it's been
all year, doll face.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.701
1926.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.715
(jazz music playing)

14:01.757 --> 14:04.593
(patrons cheering)

14:04.635 --> 14:06.846
WOMAN:
Yeah, yeah, that's right!

14:06.887 --> 14:09.431
(cheering)

14:11.934 --> 14:13.686
(whoops)

14:19.775 --> 14:21.861
WOMAN:
(laughs) Don't hurt him, baby!

14:25.823 --> 14:28.450
Sit down, Jake,
or I'll smoke you out.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.077
KAELA:
So this is real then.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.621
Mel actually
sent us to the '20s.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.373
Yeah, the wrong '20s.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.250
If she's looking for
us in 2022, then...

14:36.292 --> 14:38.627
She's never gonna find us,

14:38.669 --> 14:40.546
and we'll be stuck here forever.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.214
Okay, what about Roxie?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.258
Okay, Harry said that
she's practically immortal.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.343
So what if we could just
find her now

14:46.385 --> 14:47.928
and then tell her what's
gonna happen in the future?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.639
Yes. Then she'll be ready
for the attack,

14:50.681 --> 14:53.976
and we won't have been
sent here in the first place.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.811
Kaela, you're a genius.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.189
Wait, wait, is that actually
how time travel works?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.858
All I know is if I
think about it too much,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.027
my head is going to explode.
Okay.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.487
Hi, um, is Roxie around?

15:05.529 --> 15:08.115
We're old friends.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.159
Sorry, she's out on business.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.244
She'll be back
in a few hours, though.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.121
A few hours?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.290
Mel's gonna be dead
in, like, 20 minutes.
No, she's not.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.542
She's not even gonna
be in trouble for another...

15:18.584 --> 15:20.794
96 years?

15:20.836 --> 15:23.380
Oh, God, now I think
my head's gonna explode.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.507
The point is,
we have plenty of time

15:25.549 --> 15:29.053
to wait for Roxie.
I think.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.429
The trick is not getting
smoked out of here

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
while we do that.
Hm.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.557
I wouldn't even know
where to begin looking for

15:33.599 --> 15:35.517
a Blue Camellia matchbook
in 1926.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.478
How about we start by finding
a couple of flapper dresses,

15:37.519 --> 15:40.105
because we straight-up look like
time travelers right now, dude.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.317
I can do you one better.
What?

15:43.359 --> 15:46.820
Glamour powder. I never leave
the house without it.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.912
I lost them.
I actually lost them.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.415
They could be in ancient Rome
or some future robo-apocalypse.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.042
Or the '80s.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.835
Oh, God.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.841
Mel, you are just gonna
have to trust them

16:07.883 --> 16:09.510
to find a way back,
'cause my people are

16:09.551 --> 16:10.928
under attack down there.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.054
And as much as it pains me
to say this,

16:12.096 --> 16:13.305
I need your help.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.099
You're right.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.101
Maybe I could use my powers
to-to lower the temperature.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.269
No. You've officially
lost the right

16:19.311 --> 16:20.771
to come up with plans.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.982
I have tunnels that lead
anywhere in this bar.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.483
I'm gonna sneak down
to the entrance,

16:24.525 --> 16:26.068
blow out as many candles
as I can until I find

16:26.110 --> 16:28.612
the one that belongs to
that psychotic hobgoblin,

16:28.654 --> 16:30.572
and smoke him out of here.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.573
What about me?

16:31.615 --> 16:34.118
You stay put.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.577
This office has
a protective seal.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.121
Now that I've turned it on,
nothing gets in.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.206
I thought you said
you needed my help.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.417
I do. You're the distraction.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.585
(thunderous boom)
DONNIE: Open this damn door!

16:43.627 --> 16:46.797
(grunting)

16:47.756 --> 16:49.758
I know you're in there.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.511
Everyone saw you go in,
you cowards.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.433
You, bartender.
How do I get in?

16:57.474 --> 16:59.810
I, uh... I don't know.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.526
Don't lie to me.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.070
I'm not. I swear.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.363
She's got protective rooms
all over the place.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.657
Hey. What's your name, buddy?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.701
This has nothing
to do with you, buddy.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.537
No, I just want to know
your name.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.497
It's Donnie.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.499
Donnie. I'm Jordan.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.836
Oh, sorry.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.630
Listen, Donnie, I have a bit
of a sixth sense about people,

17:28.672 --> 17:31.425
and I know you're not
a bad guy.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.343
So why don't you tell me
what it is you want?

17:33.385 --> 17:36.513
What I want is to save us

17:36.555 --> 17:38.432
from those three tyrants
up there

17:38.474 --> 17:40.392
who think they can do
whatever they want

17:40.434 --> 17:42.811
just 'cause they were born
into magical royalty!
Okay, okay.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.521
That's a lot to unpack, but

17:44.563 --> 17:46.356
why don't we start with
that cut on your face, hmm?

17:46.398 --> 17:47.483
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell

17:47.524 --> 17:49.526
are you doing?
Don't do that.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.779
You can't use magic anywhere
near Annihilation Quartz.

17:51.820 --> 17:52.905
You'll blow us all up.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.282
Oh. My bad. My bad.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.494
Still new to this.
But, homie,

17:58.535 --> 17:59.870
you could be looking
at a permanent scar

17:59.912 --> 18:02.748
if we don't do something
about that wound.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.666
I've got a first aid kit.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.419
See?

18:07.461 --> 18:08.837
What do you say, Donnie?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.923
You want to go full Scarface

18:10.964 --> 18:14.051
or a little help from your
friendly neighborhood medic?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.847
All right.
But, um, make it fast.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.310
(cheering, applause)

18:25.854 --> 18:27.731
BARTENDER: Here you are, ladies.
BOTH: Thank you.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.818
(jazz music playing)

18:30.859 --> 18:31.819
Okay, is it just me,

18:31.860 --> 18:33.445
or is this place suddenly...

18:33.487 --> 18:37.324
A whole lot Blacker?
(chuckles) Yeah.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.700
(chuckles)

18:38.742 --> 18:40.244
I mean, it makes sense, right?

18:40.285 --> 18:41.745
There would have been
not many places

18:41.787 --> 18:44.998
to go out safely back then,
especially in the U.S.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.377
So I feel like if you were
Black and magical, this...

18:48.418 --> 18:51.255
this would have been
the place to be.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.465
(chuckles)

18:53.507 --> 18:54.925
Y-Your dad was Black, right?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.678
Yeah, my bio-dad, Dexter.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.930
But... never knew him.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.640
My mom and the dad
who raised me

19:01.682 --> 19:04.393
are both Puerto Rican, so,

19:04.434 --> 19:07.271
I didn't really grow up
with any of this.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.022
Hm.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.358
Yeah, I get it.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.570
I was raised Ghanaian.
I always just kind of figured

19:14.611 --> 19:16.029
that's who I was, and then,

19:16.071 --> 19:17.865
when I was 12,
my parents were like,

19:17.906 --> 19:20.200
"Eh, so, about that..."
(laughs)

19:20.242 --> 19:22.911
That makes you dizzy, right?
Mm-hmm.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.329
Yeah, like when you
step off a boat

19:24.371 --> 19:26.123
and the whole world's
out of balance.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.417
It's like, whoa! (laughs)
(laughs)

19:28.458 --> 19:30.252
(crowd cheering)

19:30.294 --> 19:32.212
(whoops)

19:32.254 --> 19:33.964
This is a private party.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.507
I don't recall seeing either
of you dames come in here.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.759
Uh...

19:37.801 --> 19:39.344
That's...
That... Well, that's because

19:39.386 --> 19:40.637
we're...
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.015
Nice try. Time to go.
Uh, ah...

19:43.056 --> 19:45.809
(grunts)
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
We're friends with Roxie.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.978
And I'm in a book club
with Al Capone.
Wait.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.314
We're not with the party.
(scoffs)

19:50.355 --> 19:51.982
We're the entertainment.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.026
Lady C doesn't like
sharing her stage with anyone.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.986
Ain't that right, Lady C?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.781
(mouthing)

20:02.326 --> 20:04.077
Don't get your rags
in a wrinkle, Carl.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.580
They're with me.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.998
But they better be
the bee's knees,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.500
'cause I have a reputation
to uphold.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.754
Hmm.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.756
Sorry.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.758
You said that we can't
get kicked out, so I panicked.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.593
Oh, my God.

20:24.973 --> 20:28.268
Don't even think about
touching my crystals.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.229
All it takes is one clap, and...

20:30.270 --> 20:33.607
Fiery inferno.
Yeah, I got that.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.657
What are you looking at?
Nothing.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.700
Get you a bandage.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.005
(phone ringing)

20:57.047 --> 20:58.215
Answer it.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.430
It's for you.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.773
What?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.525
MEL:
Hello, Donnie.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.569
You're one of them,
aren't you?

21:19.611 --> 21:23.031
My name is Mel and, yes,
I am a Charmed One.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.449
But whatever you think we did,

21:24.491 --> 21:27.160
I am telling you it's not true.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.162
Of course it's true.

21:29.204 --> 21:32.291
I was there at Ripples.
Saw the whole thing.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.419
I lost my job 'cause you three
screwed up doing yours.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.921
I'm sorry we couldn't
save the spa.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.841
But at least we saved
the people in it.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.760
You mean like how you saved
Frank the Leprechaun?

21:43.802 --> 21:46.388
Or that poor Lamia?

21:51.351 --> 21:53.186
How do you know about that?

21:53.228 --> 21:56.231
Your days of operating
in the shadows are over.

21:56.273 --> 22:00.485
We have the information now.
We have the power.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.905
And we've got questions,
Melanie Vera.

22:03.947 --> 22:06.616
Why should we even believe
you three are so charmed...

22:06.658 --> 22:08.744
ROXIE:
Why are all the candles red?

22:08.785 --> 22:12.039
DONNIE:
So why don't you show us your
birth certificates, huh?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.540
Speaking of which,

22:13.582 --> 22:14.583
what's with all these

22:14.624 --> 22:16.168
ridiculous "M" names?

22:16.209 --> 22:19.338
You know it's a cursed letter,
right? Everyone...

22:19.379 --> 22:21.757
(screaming)

22:44.863 --> 22:46.406
What the hell happened
down there?

22:46.448 --> 22:47.949
He must have put a hex
on the candles.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.619
Now, if anyone tries
to leave, they die.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.120
Are you sure it was him?

22:52.162 --> 22:53.580
What do you mean?
I mean, that seems

22:53.622 --> 22:57.042
really smart for a guy
who's clearly not.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.419
Maybe he had help.
Someone

22:59.461 --> 23:01.171
on the inside.
No. No one down there

23:01.213 --> 23:02.589
would ever sell this place out.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.216
Fine, but I am done
waiting around

23:04.257 --> 23:05.592
for someone else to get hurt.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.968
Where, exactly,
are you going with that?

23:08.011 --> 23:10.097
I may not be able to
use magic on him,

23:10.138 --> 23:12.599
but I can cut off his hand
to get to that quartz.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.690
I'll show you the way.

You're in charge here.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.224
You have the power.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.226
You can do this.
You can do this.

26:01.268 --> 26:05.730
Now, there's got to be
some kind

26:05.772 --> 26:08.775
of secret tunnel back here.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.195
Huh.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.781
(knocking continues)

26:50.692 --> 26:52.736
Are you all right?

26:52.777 --> 26:57.574
This is my fight
now, not yours.

27:00.493 --> 27:01.995
I knew it!

27:02.704 --> 27:04.414
(Roxie cries out)

27:12.088 --> 27:14.299
Sunny?

27:31.524 --> 27:33.193
Everyone sit down.

27:33.234 --> 27:35.403
(indistinct chatter)

27:35.445 --> 27:37.113
Didn't she already
get eaten by a purse?

27:37.155 --> 27:39.074
That won't happen
for many, many years.

27:39.115 --> 27:43.036
Roses are red,
camellias are blue.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.705
Someone was naughty,

27:45.747 --> 27:49.376
and that someone is...

27:49.417 --> 27:51.419
you!
(crowd gasps)

27:54.881 --> 27:56.800
I'll deal with
bag lady from hell,

27:56.841 --> 27:58.718
you help Lady C.
Okay.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.638
Hey!

28:01.680 --> 28:03.556
You don't want to do this.

28:03.598 --> 28:06.726
Wrong.
I have to do this.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.479
That muse has been
driving humans wild

28:09.521 --> 28:10.605
all over Paris,

28:10.647 --> 28:13.525
and she must be punished.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.276
For all our safety.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.990
You're gonna have to
deal with me first...

28:21.032 --> 28:22.992
bitch.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.501
(door opens)

28:31.543 --> 28:33.044
Stay back.

28:33.086 --> 28:36.840
It's okay.
I'm here to help. Really.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.633
That exact same vittra
tried to kill me,

28:38.675 --> 28:39.884
like, three weeks ago.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.389
Well, three weeks
and 96 years,

28:44.431 --> 28:46.391
but I can't explain
that right now.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.394
What are you?
I'm a friend.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.479
You need to tell me,
why is she after you?

28:51.521 --> 28:54.315
Because I'm a muse.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.109
Okay.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.571
I love the stage more than
anything in the world.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.281
But sometimes when
I dance in front of people,

29:01.322 --> 29:04.951
they can occasionally
go a bit... batty.

29:04.993 --> 29:09.247
Um, why don't you just stop,
or dance here instead?

29:09.289 --> 29:11.708
Have you ever been to the
Folies Bergére in Paris?

29:11.750 --> 29:15.962
Those lights, that crowd.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.672
It's like oxygen.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.049
Doesn't it scare you?

29:20.091 --> 29:23.178
Your power could cause
something terrible to happen.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.429
Not as much as it scares me
to imagine

29:24.471 --> 29:26.389
a life away from the stage.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.891
(violent clatter)

29:27.932 --> 29:29.934
(grunting)

29:37.275 --> 29:38.526
Ah.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.115
(Roxie whimpers)

29:45.033 --> 29:46.534
No.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.291
Who are you?

29:53.333 --> 29:54.584
SUNNY:
Come on, Donnie.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.503
Don't you recognize
my voice?

29:56.544 --> 29:59.422
After all those chats
on your GemCast?

29:59.464 --> 30:00.965
You're the one
who sent me the matchbook.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.842
And tipped me off
when they got here.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.469
And put a hex on the candles.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.137
But don't worry.
I'm not keeping a tab.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.599
Just happy to support
a fellow unseen creature.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.434
Why?

30:11.476 --> 30:14.854
(chuckles softly) Because
I believe in something, Donnie.

30:14.896 --> 30:18.817
A future
beyond our wildest dreams.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.861
One where we don't need
the Charmed Ones.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.613
(exhales)

30:23.655 --> 30:25.490
What were you thinking?

30:25.532 --> 30:28.076
I'll be fine.
(chuckles)

30:28.117 --> 30:29.953
Her claw missed my heart.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.914
It's your fault
for spilling that damn perfume.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.041
What?

30:35.083 --> 30:36.793
Belonged to my wife.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.212
Camellia.
(chuckles)

30:39.254 --> 30:41.881
(exhales, gasps softly)

30:41.923 --> 30:43.508
She was almost killed

30:43.550 --> 30:47.470
by vittras once a long time ago.

30:47.512 --> 30:51.099
If it wasn't
for these two strangers,

30:51.140 --> 30:53.226
I would have lost her.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.690
But when I s...

30:58.731 --> 31:01.860
smelled her perfume,

31:01.901 --> 31:04.863
I couldn't let that
happen again.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.573
(grunting)

31:13.246 --> 31:15.081
You.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.043
(Roxie panting)

31:22.755 --> 31:24.674
(both gasp)

31:24.716 --> 31:26.009
Ah.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.221
(snarling)
(Lady C screams)

31:30.263 --> 31:33.224
(Kaela grunts)
(roaring)

31:33.266 --> 31:34.601
(grunts)

31:37.228 --> 31:40.273
Unless you want me to do that
to one of Seymour's

31:40.315 --> 31:42.442
other arms,
I suggest you leave.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.235
Now. Hmm?

31:48.197 --> 31:50.033
(whispers):
Are you okay?

31:50.074 --> 31:52.285
(breathing shakily)

31:52.327 --> 31:54.495
See you in 96 years.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.963
(exhales shakily)

32:05.673 --> 32:07.467
(breathing heavily)

32:12.764 --> 32:14.766
Enough, Donnie.

32:18.227 --> 32:20.313
No one else gets hurt.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.406
You wanted a Charmed One?

32:30.448 --> 32:32.909
You got one.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.966
KAELA:
Hey. Here you go.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.884
You all right?

32:49.926 --> 32:51.928
Hotsy-totsy.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.395
The perfume you're wearing,

33:00.436 --> 33:03.481
it's the same stuff
that Roxie had.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.358
Mm. So, you met my wife.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.152
Your wife? You're...
Mm-hmm.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.405
Camellia.
Lady C's my stage name.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.532
(chuckles)
I...

33:12.573 --> 33:14.492
What are those?

33:15.451 --> 33:16.828
Oh, they're power cuffs.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.247
They, uh, shut off
any magical ability.

33:19.288 --> 33:22.125
Of course a vittra
would carry these around.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.960
Are you saying if I
wear one of those,

33:24.002 --> 33:25.420
I can dance at the Folies
without causing

33:25.461 --> 33:27.255
a stampede
of horny men and women?

33:27.296 --> 33:30.717
Uh, did I miss something?
(chuckles)
Just give her a cuff.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.140
Here.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.934
You have no idea
what this means to me,

33:39.976 --> 33:42.687
getting to keep doing my art.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.814
I can't wait to tell Roxie.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.075
Oh, my God.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.537
Oh, my God. I-I know
why Mel sent us to the '20s.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.998
And I know how we can get
a message back to her.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.332
That painting that I liked

34:03.374 --> 34:04.333
in the future?

34:04.375 --> 34:06.044
It's not here.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.879
Okay.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.505
That's because I'm the one
who painted it.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.090
Or, at least, I'm going to.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.217
Do you remember
the date on it?

34:13.259 --> 34:14.594
March 3rd.

34:14.635 --> 34:18.139
1926. That's today.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.640
That was you.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.560
It will be
with my powers shut off.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.988
Mel must have been thinking
about that date

34:34.030 --> 34:35.448
before she whooshed us
back here,

34:35.490 --> 34:37.825
so if we can get paintings
all over the bar

34:37.867 --> 34:40.661
to make sure she sees one,
then maybe

34:40.703 --> 34:42.455
she can pull us back home.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.165
I do know a spell
to set an alarm.

34:44.207 --> 34:47.376
I mean, I haven't set a timer
for 96 years before,

34:47.418 --> 34:50.254
but it's worth a shot.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.381
Okay.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.175
DONNIE:
Now I can finally

34:54.217 --> 34:57.637
show the world what a pathetic
excuse for heroes you are.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.013
Where are the other two?

34:59.055 --> 35:01.599
(bell tolling)

35:05.728 --> 35:07.814
Kaela.
DONNIE:
What about Kaela?

35:07.855 --> 35:10.525
What are you doing?

35:11.442 --> 35:13.402
(clock ticking)

35:13.444 --> 35:15.530
(jazz music playing)
(dialogue inaudible)

35:24.622 --> 35:25.581
The hell?

35:25.623 --> 35:27.166
Behind you.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.672
Where did you find
Egyptian nightshade?
(groaning)

35:32.713 --> 35:34.132
(exhales)

35:34.173 --> 35:36.300
More like "when?"

35:36.342 --> 35:37.844
(chuckles)

35:47.770 --> 35:50.606
I'm not one for grand gestures
of appreciation,

35:50.648 --> 35:52.024
but thank you.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.734
You ought to thank Jordan.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.862
Sure. He healed the wound.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.072
But you saved the bar.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.242
(Mel exhales)

36:01.284 --> 36:02.785
No, I can't.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.620
Trust me.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.581
It's a good scent on you.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.628
KAELA:
Mel?

36:12.670 --> 36:14.297
You should come
and see this.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.474
TROLL:
And do the research yourself.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.810
These Charmed Ones?

36:27.852 --> 36:31.522
Assuming this new girl
even is a Charmed One.

36:31.564 --> 36:35.484
They're
the most powerful witches alive,

36:35.526 --> 36:37.570
but where are they
while this Tallyman's

36:37.612 --> 36:40.406
wreaking havoc on our world?
Huh?

36:40.448 --> 36:42.783
Oh, I'm gonna tell you where.

36:42.825 --> 36:45.411
At some fancy-pants spa.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.954
That's...

36:46.996 --> 36:50.374
That is completely
out of context.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.001
Doesn't matter.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.711
Tallyman has people scared.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.421
And scared people

36:55.463 --> 36:57.965
need someone to blame
for their fear.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.926
But how can they blame us?
MAGGIE:
They have

36:59.967 --> 37:01.469
no idea what we've
been through, Mel.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.054
What we've lost.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.056
That's why it's so easy
for people like Donnie

37:05.097 --> 37:07.099
to buy into all the lies.

37:07.141 --> 37:10.019
Reputations are temporary.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.939
Just like glamour powder,
apparently.

37:12.980 --> 37:16.817
If we can stop the Tallyman,
we can silence the trolls.

37:16.859 --> 37:19.528
And start telling people
the truth.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.051
Uh, Mel?

37:43.010 --> 37:44.804
Good morning.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.889
I hope you don't mind
me helping out.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.516
Oh, of course I don't mind.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.518
Uh, I just...

37:50.559 --> 37:52.853
thought you'd be avoiding me
for a while.

37:52.895 --> 37:55.189
Well, I, I was at first.

37:55.231 --> 37:58.025
And then I realized that
there are more important things

37:58.067 --> 37:59.485
than my sad little love life.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.487
And the truth is, is that

38:01.529 --> 38:04.365
I'm happy for you and Swan.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.866
Really.

38:05.908 --> 38:09.745

in the mail today.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.358
It's called

Hey, Kaela?

Before you do this, I...

39:34.205 --> 39:37.375
I just want to say
I'm sorry if I ever...

39:37.416 --> 39:41.295
made you feel
like you weren't a real sister.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.381
Oh, dude, you have nothing
to apologize for.

39:43.422 --> 39:46.050

39:46.092 --> 39:47.885

(chuckles)

in the past,

39:49.637 --> 39:52.640
I, I definitely felt
something between us.

39:52.681 --> 39:55.101
I know. I felt it, too.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.561
I just knew somehow

39:57.603 --> 40:00.523
that the three of us,

40:00.564 --> 40:01.982
we're sisters.

40:02.024 --> 40:04.527
Like, real sisters.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.571
Then I say we find out the truth

40:07.613 --> 40:09.824
and make this thing official.
