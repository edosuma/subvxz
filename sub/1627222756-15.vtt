00:04.340 --> 00:05.560
Previously on
"The Walking Dead"...

00:05.580 --> 00:07.080
Y'all looting houses now?

00:07.170 --> 00:08.560
Sebastian made us come in here.
He threatened our kids.

00:08.580 --> 00:09.580
That the money?

00:09.680 --> 00:11.370
Home with...

00:11.650 --> 00:13.280
He's been finding desperate people,

00:13.300 --> 00:16.410
- sending them through
swarms to get stashes of cash.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.960
Most of them didn't make it out.

00:17.990 --> 00:20.300
Things just got a little out of hand.

00:20.610 --> 00:22.300
Aah!

00:22.580 --> 00:23.650
It's only a matter of time-

00:23.920 --> 00:25.730
- before Hornsby comes for these people.

00:25.750 --> 00:26.910
Then we have to do something.

00:27.100 --> 00:30.060
But if Ian didn't steal
the weapons, who did?

01:11.340 --> 01:13.140
They're looking for you on the roof.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.750
Guys, you see my problem here.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.060
This is not a good look.

01:25.060 --> 01:27.610
It puts all of us in a very tough spot.

01:27.610 --> 01:31.100
Problem or not, it's the truth.

01:31.100 --> 01:33.750
So, let's just run through
this one more time,

01:33.750 --> 01:35.610
- make sure I got it straight.

01:35.610 --> 01:36.960
You went in.
Things got tense.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.580
A firefight broke out.

01:38.580 --> 01:39.920
Then the people here-

01:39.920 --> 01:42.610
- killed every last one of our trained,

01:42.610 --> 01:44.480
- armed, and armored soldiers,

01:44.480 --> 01:46.130
- but not you two,

01:46.130 --> 01:48.820
- the one-armed guy and the priest.

01:48.820 --> 01:50.230
Then the killers escaped.

01:50.230 --> 01:52.060
You called me over the walkie.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.610
We drove up.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.580
And here we are.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.820
That's your story?

01:58.820 --> 02:00.410
That's basically it, yeah.
Yeah.

02:00.410 --> 02:01.910
Yeah. Yes.

02:04.270 --> 02:07.160
What do you think about all this?

02:11.990 --> 02:14.480
Well, we've been on the road a long time.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.650
They can definitely handle themselves.

02:16.650 --> 02:17.890
If that's what they say happened,

02:17.890 --> 02:19.820
- that's what happened.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.650
Maybe.

02:24.650 --> 02:26.300
But I have another theory.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.130
Just hear me out.

02:28.130 --> 02:29.440
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense-

02:29.440 --> 02:31.850
- for a bunch of crazed,
violent strangers-

02:31.860 --> 02:34.650
- to just keep the two of you alive.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.650
It also doesn't make sense
for the two of you to lie-

02:36.650 --> 02:39.680
- to protect a bunch of crazed,
violent strangers...

02:39.680 --> 02:42.650
Unless they weren't strangers.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.060
Are you calling us liars?

02:46.060 --> 02:48.510
Your guy lost control of the situation.

02:48.510 --> 02:51.370
We barely survived.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.720
We're not gonna take the fall for this.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.270
Okay.
Fair enough.

03:01.270 --> 03:02.650
I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers here.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.200
I've just got a job to do.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.000
At the end of the day,
we all want the same thing, right?

03:08.680 --> 03:11.200
Justice.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.100
Of course.

03:14.860 --> 03:17.300
You two keep searching the area
while the rest of us move out.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.820
Copy that, sir.
To the Commonwealth?

03:19.820 --> 03:22.200
Oh, no.
There's monsters running loose.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.920
We need to smoke them out.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.340
We'll start with the hilltop,

03:27.340 --> 03:28.750
- see if our friends heard anything.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.230
At the very least, they should know-

03:30.230 --> 03:31.850
- there's some very dangerous people-

03:31.860 --> 03:34.340
- who might be coming their way.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.230
Better suit up, soldier.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.840
Good morning.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.480
Last night was fun.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.130
And the night before.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.990
Yeah.

04:58.990 --> 05:01.820
We're pretty awesome at this sex thing.

05:01.820 --> 05:03.410
And I should know.

05:03.410 --> 05:06.200
I've had a lot of sex in my life.

05:07.300 --> 05:11.030
Well... not a lot of sex.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.820
Wait.
You know what?

05:14.820 --> 05:16.680
We're both adults.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.300
I've had a lot of sex,
and you've had a lot of sex.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.480
I love listening to you talk.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.480
And, of course, the sex.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.300
Me, too.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.480
But, dude, these crack-of-dawn,

05:33.480 --> 05:36.820
- super-soldier wake-up times suck ass.

05:36.820 --> 05:39.100
I don't know how you do it.
Do you even need sleep?

05:39.100 --> 05:40.440
'Cause every time I roll over,

05:40.440 --> 05:43.510
- you're just lying there
staring at the ceiling.

05:44.820 --> 05:48.410
I think you're part robot.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.680
That's it.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.340
You got me.

05:51.340 --> 05:54.030
Beep.
Beep, beep.

05:54.030 --> 05:56.060
Mm.

05:59.410 --> 06:01.200
Come on.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.200
What's the deal with that?

06:03.200 --> 06:07.030
Is it some kind of meditation?

06:07.030 --> 06:09.920
Maybe I'm just basking in the afterglow.

06:11.890 --> 06:13.890
I sleep fine.

06:13.890 --> 06:16.540
I do have that effect on people.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.890
But it didn't really look like basking,

06:18.890 --> 06:22.890
- more like... stewing.

06:22.890 --> 06:24.340
You getting at something?

06:24.340 --> 06:28.230
No.
Just making sure you're cool.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.720
Okay, then.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.720
I'm fine.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.060
Great.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.920
Totally.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.370
But if there was anything-

06:41.370 --> 06:43.610
- you needed to get off your chest...

06:45.890 --> 06:49.100
All I'm saying is that,
contrary popular opinion,

06:49.100 --> 06:51.680
- I'm pretty freaking great at listening.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.720
I said I'm fine.

06:58.580 --> 07:02.580
Message received loud and clear.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.270
See?

07:04.270 --> 07:06.270
Good at listening.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.960
You're gonna be late for work.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.480
Come in.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.410
Apologies for the early-morning invite.

07:33.410 --> 07:36.820
This discussion isn't quite
ready for public broadcast.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.130
Are you two okay?

07:42.130 --> 07:44.820
That message seemed pretty urgent.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.230
Rosita confided in me-

07:46.230 --> 07:48.160
- about a harrowing experience-

07:48.170 --> 07:50.790
- she recently encountered on the job.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.650
We thought it would be beneficial,

07:52.650 --> 07:55.160
- given your position as a
truth-telling news person,

07:55.170 --> 07:58.990
- to give you the deets.

07:58.990 --> 08:00.790
Alright, so, what's up?

08:00.790 --> 08:03.200
Sebastian and some of his cronies-

08:03.200 --> 08:05.230
- forced Daryl and I to steal cash-

08:05.230 --> 08:07.990
- from an abandoned
house outside the perimeter.

08:07.990 --> 08:09.340
There was a woman there.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.580
They had done this before.

08:10.580 --> 08:11.990
They had sent civilians in,

08:11.990 --> 08:14.540
- and none of them made it out alive.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.340
They wanted us to stay quiet,

08:18.340 --> 08:21.650
- but I think about that woman, April,

08:21.650 --> 08:24.850
- and what they all went through.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.200
There are good people here.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.160
They need to know the truth.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.679
Mm-hmm.

08:35.679 --> 08:39.030
Someone sent us a list
of names of people-

08:39.030 --> 08:41.030
- when the ex-trooper went missing.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.340
We tried to figure it out,

08:42.340 --> 08:44.750
- but we just kept hitting dead ends.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.030
April Martens.
That could be her, right?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.850
Let me see that.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.510
No, there are way more names on this list-

08:56.510 --> 08:58.890
- than Sebastian sent into that house.

08:58.890 --> 09:02.200
Maybe it's related, but there's
something else going on here.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.540
Whatever this is,

09:03.550 --> 09:06.060
- if the Miltons are involved,

09:06.060 --> 09:09.410
- they'll keep it locked up.

09:09.410 --> 09:12.720
We need inside access to dig it out.

09:20.550 --> 09:23.130
I might know someone.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.230
You got everything you need?

09:27.230 --> 09:29.230
- I think so.
- Good.

09:29.230 --> 09:32.580
And I'll make sure RJ gets
to his classes on time today.

09:32.580 --> 09:34.720
Alright.
Well, you better.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.100
- Come on, slowpoke.
- Here you go.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.440
Ezekiel.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.720
Good day, young friends.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.720
Drink deep from
the cup of knowledge-

09:42.720 --> 09:45.480
- and listen to your teachers.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.720
Huh?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.100
Alright, go on.
Here you go.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.200
- Thank you.
- Bye.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.440
Bye!

09:54.440 --> 09:56.130
You're looking lively.

09:56.130 --> 09:59.270
Well, losing a tumor the size
of a grapefruit works wonders.

09:59.270 --> 10:01.580
Recovery's going well?

10:01.580 --> 10:04.650
Still got a ways to go,
but prognosis is good.

10:04.650 --> 10:07.580
Healing well.

10:07.580 --> 10:08.990
Yeah, I was thinking about-

10:08.990 --> 10:11.790
- what you said before.

10:11.790 --> 10:14.130
How I reacted.

10:14.130 --> 10:17.300
I never properly thanked you.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.790
You don't have to thank me.

10:18.790 --> 10:19.890
- I do.
- No.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.480
Can't imagine the lengths you went to-

10:22.480 --> 10:24.300
- to make this happen.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.890
Least I can do is say "thank you."

10:26.890 --> 10:28.100
I've been busy.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.440
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.100
I took your words to heart about...

10:32.100 --> 10:33.610
...doing something extra-

10:33.610 --> 10:36.300
- with this time I've been given.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.960
I'd love to show you if you're free.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.820
Today's tough.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.850
Can't do it today.

10:42.860 --> 10:43.890
Come on.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.340
- No, really...
- Play hooky with me.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.820
Ah, I can't.
I'm swamped at work.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.300
At the bakery?

10:49.300 --> 10:50.540
Um, well, no.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.510
Um, I got another job.

10:53.510 --> 10:54.990
It's just this thing I had to...

10:54.990 --> 10:56.270
Um, it's a...

10:56.270 --> 10:58.820
It's... It's complicated.

10:58.820 --> 10:59.990
And something happened,

10:59.990 --> 11:01.680
- and then things went all sideways.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.340
- And I have to go...
- Carol.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.680
Hey.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.990
I just have some things-

11:06.990 --> 11:11.030
- that I need to figure out first...
to fix.

11:11.030 --> 11:13.650
Uh, it's better that-

11:13.650 --> 11:15.750
- you don't even know about it, okay?

11:15.750 --> 11:17.340
Just trust me.

11:21.340 --> 11:23.340
I trust you...

11:23.340 --> 11:25.720
...more than anyone.

11:27.860 --> 11:31.060
You'd think this place would
make life easier, huh?

11:33.370 --> 11:35.850
Feels like there's a
lot more gray instead.

11:39.370 --> 11:40.790
Rain check?

11:40.790 --> 11:42.200
Guaranteed.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.510
I'm getting healthy again.

11:43.510 --> 11:44.890
You're stuck with me.

11:44.890 --> 11:47.370
I guess I can live with that.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.370
Bye.

11:55.230 --> 11:57.060
Bye.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.270
Why don't you two take care of this?

12:18.270 --> 12:19.580
Are you serious?

12:19.580 --> 12:21.750
We have to save our ammunition.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.100
I was told you can handle yourselves.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.750
Where's the problem?

13:29.230 --> 13:31.440
We saved you a bullet.

13:35.790 --> 13:38.480
And barely broke a sweat!

13:38.480 --> 13:40.510
Nice!

13:40.510 --> 13:42.440
Come on, let's keep moving!

13:45.680 --> 13:47.850
Helmet on, soldier.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.200
This a bad time?

14:33.200 --> 14:34.410
Not the best day,

14:34.410 --> 14:37.200
- but, um, please come in.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.990
Are you feeling okay?

14:42.990 --> 14:45.230
- Is there something...
- No, no.

14:45.230 --> 14:47.030
I'm great.

14:47.030 --> 14:49.580
This is about a friend of mine.

14:49.580 --> 14:53.410
She's sick and can't afford the treatment.

14:53.410 --> 14:55.790
Won't put her family into debt.

14:55.790 --> 14:59.230
She needs a small procedure.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.720
If we can take care of
it outside the system...

15:01.720 --> 15:06.060
W-What sort of procedure?

15:06.060 --> 15:07.560
Appendectomy.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.410
Ezekiel...
I've secured the equipment-

15:10.410 --> 15:12.030
- and a sterile operating area.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.100
I just need a few extra supplies-

15:14.100 --> 15:17.750
- and... you.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.100
Ezekiel, this is incredibly risky.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.890
I understand that.
And And not just for her.

15:22.890 --> 15:26.580
For... For everyone involved.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.650
She's not gonna change her mind,

15:28.650 --> 15:30.510
- and I understand the risks.

15:30.510 --> 15:32.300
She does, too.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.100
I wouldn't ask if this
wasn't her best option.

15:42.610 --> 15:45.440
I lost a patient this morning.

15:48.610 --> 15:51.650
I'm sorry.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.100
And that was here.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.610
That was here, Ezekiel, in a hospital.

15:57.610 --> 16:01.480
Tomi... you're the only
one that can do this.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.100
Please.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.960
Do your part to keep our community safe.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.960
If you see something, say something.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.030
Remember, we are all in this together.

16:15.030 --> 16:16.820
What are you doing here?
We shouldn't be seen together.

16:16.820 --> 16:19.370
Circumstances required
an immediate face-to-face.

16:19.370 --> 16:21.340
I took precautions... see?

16:21.340 --> 16:23.170
Just a humble delivery boy.

16:26.650 --> 16:28.100
I don't understand.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.960
You want me to look for secret files?

16:29.960 --> 16:32.340
Yes, and steal them.

16:32.340 --> 16:34.510
Eugene, we're supposed
to be staying out of trouble,

16:34.510 --> 16:35.960
- not looking for it.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.300
Things have finally been
going right with Hornsby,

16:38.300 --> 16:40.680
- and the Alexandria
rebuild is coming along.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.650
My friends didn't have a choice.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.160
Rosita was forced into the situation-

16:44.170 --> 16:46.340
- by Sebastian.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.680
Wait.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.650
This involves the Miltons?

16:49.650 --> 16:52.200
The young psychopath, at least.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.850
Okay, um, you could have led-

16:55.860 --> 16:58.990
- with that bit of information.

16:58.990 --> 17:02.340
Max, people have died.

17:02.340 --> 17:06.030
More are missing.
Your brother can corroborate.

17:06.030 --> 17:08.230
Michael?

17:08.230 --> 17:10.200
He was there, too.

17:12.550 --> 17:15.819
Oh, um, sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.369
No.
Not at all.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.849
Um, the room is all yours.

17:19.859 --> 17:22.859
Thank you so much.

17:23.890 --> 17:26.200
There you go.
Have a nice day.

17:45.410 --> 17:48.750
Afternoon, Maggie.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.270
Good to see you again.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.890
What do you want?

17:53.890 --> 17:56.440
There are some killers on the loose.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.060
We lost a lot of men.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.580
So I'm hunting them down.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.920
And the property they stole,

18:01.920 --> 18:03.610
- the Commonwealth's property.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.820
I don't know anything about that.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.540
Well, of course not.

18:08.550 --> 18:11.720
So you wouldn't mind if we just
do a quick look around, right?

18:11.720 --> 18:14.270
Rule you all out.

18:14.270 --> 18:17.440
For the paperwork.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.270
I gave you my answer.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.100
You're gonna get people killed-

18:39.100 --> 18:41.230
- if you force your way in there.

18:41.230 --> 18:43.920
She isn't giving me
much of a choice here.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.100
I'll talk to her.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.440
And why would you do that?

18:47.440 --> 18:49.840
Because I don't want to
shoot anybody here today.

18:51.650 --> 18:52.820
Let me do this.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.610
We go in, nobody gets hurt.

18:54.610 --> 18:56.270
Deal?

18:58.990 --> 19:02.300
Deal.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.130
Open up.

19:04.130 --> 19:06.650
It doesn't have to be this way.

19:15.990 --> 19:18.650
Yeah, it does.

19:21.300 --> 19:24.850
Ain't nobody leaving
until they look around.

19:24.860 --> 19:28.480
It'll be quick, I promise.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.680
You expect me to trust him?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.850
I ain't asking you to trust him.

19:35.860 --> 19:37.750
I'm asking you to trust me.

20:35.230 --> 20:38.100
You gonna tell me what's going on?

20:38.100 --> 20:40.580
I'm gonna need you to be more specific.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.920
Uh, Sebastian, a heist,

20:42.920 --> 20:44.750
- people missing?

20:44.750 --> 20:46.100
Sounds like you already know.

20:46.100 --> 20:49.100
But I want to hear it from you.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.920
Why would you keep
something like this from me?

20:54.060 --> 20:56.410
'Cause it's not your business.

20:56.410 --> 20:57.920
I mean, what you want to hear?

20:57.920 --> 20:59.920
This place ain't perfect?

20:59.920 --> 21:01.230
That we're lucky to have-

21:01.230 --> 21:03.430
- some parts of the old world,
warts and all?

21:07.130 --> 21:09.750
Ain't none of this shit new.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.230
People hurt each other.
People kill each other.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.480
Happens all the time.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.920
It's part of the job.
And what?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.270
That's just supposed to
make everything okay?

21:17.270 --> 21:20.130
No.
Of course not.

21:21.270 --> 21:24.920
People lost their lives
because I failed them.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.130
I missed it.

21:27.130 --> 21:30.340
The weight of that is
mine to carry, not yours.

21:32.170 --> 21:35.480
I'm not a little kid anymore, Mike.

21:37.610 --> 21:39.300
You don't need to play big brother-

21:39.300 --> 21:42.300
- and protect me from the world.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.270
Says the little girl who
almost got caught-

21:44.270 --> 21:45.820
- on the radio a few months ago.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.480
Okay, that's not fair.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.850
Look, I don't want to fight with you.

21:48.860 --> 21:50.650
Then let me help you.

21:50.650 --> 21:52.340
You want to help?

21:52.340 --> 21:53.650
Let it go.

21:53.650 --> 21:55.790
It's over.
I fixed it.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.340
And what about Sebastian?

21:58.340 --> 21:59.820
Again, you already know.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.820
Come on, now.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.130
How are you okay-

22:03.130 --> 22:05.130
- with letting that
little bastard walk free?

22:05.130 --> 22:08.610
Because I got 50.000
other lives to think about.

22:08.610 --> 22:11.480
Oh, please.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.990
So, I go after the kid,

22:12.990 --> 22:14.680
- what happens then?

22:15.820 --> 22:19.990
You think that kind of
insubordination is gonna slide?

22:19.990 --> 22:22.680
Then what?

22:22.680 --> 22:25.200
What if I disappear?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.030
Who keeps this place running?

22:29.030 --> 22:30.440
If the Commonwealth falls,

22:30.440 --> 22:31.820
- a lot more people
are gonna wind up dead-

22:31.820 --> 22:33.920
- than the ones in that house.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.680
Not all of us view human lives-

22:36.680 --> 22:38.510
- as acceptable losses.

22:41.030 --> 22:42.890
Pam's your boss, too.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.540
Take it up with her.

22:44.550 --> 22:45.610
You got her ear.

22:45.610 --> 22:48.720
Yeah, and you've got the community's.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.920
They listen to you.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.540
They look up to you...
Literally.

22:56.340 --> 22:59.510
I am just a soldier.

22:59.510 --> 23:03.370
But you could be so much more.

23:03.370 --> 23:05.510
You could change this place.

23:08.550 --> 23:12.060
But maybe that's just me being naive.

23:12.060 --> 23:14.540
Maybe you are really just a poster.

23:40.410 --> 23:42.820
Good.

23:54.580 --> 23:56.580
They should move on in a minute.

23:56.580 --> 23:58.580
Then we head for the loading dock.

23:59.920 --> 24:02.440
For a guy who was worried
about coloring outside the lines,

24:02.440 --> 24:05.960
- you're handling it well...
Maybe even enjoying it.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.270
I've broken my share of rules-

24:08.270 --> 24:09.960
- once upon a time.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.130
My sister can attest to that.

24:13.130 --> 24:17.130
But this place has a way of lulling you.

24:17.130 --> 24:18.610
Why upset the applecart-

24:18.610 --> 24:21.610
- if it's keeping you safe, right?

24:21.610 --> 24:24.440
That is the struggle...

24:24.440 --> 24:28.440
Protecting ourselves or others?

24:28.440 --> 24:30.650
I wouldn't mind both.

24:30.650 --> 24:31.960
Hmm.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.960
- Ready?
- Yeah.

24:42.990 --> 24:44.820
Ooh!

24:50.030 --> 24:53.130
Shit.

24:57.650 --> 24:59.990
Nice truck!

25:01.790 --> 25:03.230
This new?

25:03.230 --> 25:04.850
I started converting the engine,

25:04.860 --> 25:07.370
- but it doesn't run.

25:07.370 --> 25:11.160
You know we found
tire tracks at the scene?

25:11.170 --> 25:13.200
Not a lot of cars running these days.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.440
You got something you want to say,

25:14.440 --> 25:16.230
- why don't you just say it?

25:16.230 --> 25:18.680
Just stating the facts.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.540
You know, I come from
a long line of gear heads.

25:22.550 --> 25:24.610
You mind?

25:28.680 --> 25:31.820
She sure is clean for a
truck that just sits here.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.580
Ethanol conversion is solid.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.230
Intake looks good.

25:43.230 --> 25:46.030
We left plenty of fuel the
last time we were here.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.230
No wonder she won't work.

25:52.230 --> 25:55.060
The starter relay is disconnected.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.720
- I'll just...
- Go ahead...

25:56.720 --> 25:59.720
...and hook that back up for you.

26:05.890 --> 26:08.130
Let's test it out,

26:08.130 --> 26:10.890
- see if I've got the magic touch.

27:00.890 --> 27:03.650
You and your people have 'til sundown.

27:05.610 --> 27:08.130
Then you can be on your way.

27:33.170 --> 27:36.990
Oh, God.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.160
Oh.

27:47.650 --> 27:50.200
I can handle them from here.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.130
Thanks for the discretion.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.850
I was hoping this new job of yours-

27:58.860 --> 28:00.820
- had connections here.

28:00.820 --> 28:02.230
I might have mentioned your name.

28:02.230 --> 28:03.680
Yeah, well, my old man used to say,

28:03.680 --> 28:05.200
- "It's the hope that kills you."

28:05.200 --> 28:07.200
Are we screwed?

28:07.200 --> 28:08.540
I don't do well in confinement.

28:08.550 --> 28:10.030
Don't... Don't worry.

28:10.030 --> 28:11.510
I've got it handled.

28:11.510 --> 28:13.370
Unless you plan on getting
in more trouble today?

28:13.370 --> 28:14.580
Hey!

28:14.580 --> 28:17.030
Not all trouble is bad trouble.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.680
Come see.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.030
We already pulled you out of work.

28:21.030 --> 28:23.200
What's a few more minutes?

28:35.030 --> 28:38.890
Ezekiel, please tell me
your friend is human.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.580
Hey.

28:49.580 --> 28:51.890
Go ahead.
Here.

28:57.060 --> 28:58.960
Hey, Ezekiel.

29:01.890 --> 29:03.270
Wow.

29:03.270 --> 29:05.580
You really have been busy.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.720
I've got a debt to repay.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.300
Is my patient already here?

29:11.580 --> 29:13.060
Theresa's in the back.

29:13.060 --> 29:15.300
Hey, Zeke.

29:21.610 --> 29:24.230
Hey.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.440
You got a minute?

29:25.440 --> 29:29.100
For you?

29:29.100 --> 29:31.820
Um, I got two.

29:33.750 --> 29:37.820
I-I wanted to apologize...
For earlier.

29:41.300 --> 29:44.650
This whole thing is new to me.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.960
I-I mean, not the sex part, but, uh...

29:49.300 --> 29:52.480
...us.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.960
And, uh, I don't want to...

29:57.410 --> 30:00.790
Okay, listen.

30:00.790 --> 30:02.960
I got a special sense-

30:02.960 --> 30:07.300
- for when somebody's...
not okay.

30:07.300 --> 30:10.130
A lot of firsthand experience.

30:10.130 --> 30:15.300
And I might put out this totally sexy,

30:15.300 --> 30:18.130
- carefree, fun-times vibe,

30:18.130 --> 30:20.990
- but I can handle heavy stuff, too.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.510
In... In case...

30:27.510 --> 30:30.340
...you ever need it.

30:35.340 --> 30:37.850
I killed two of my men.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.130
And I covered it up.

30:44.820 --> 30:46.820
Never thought I'd be that guy.

30:46.820 --> 30:48.160
That's not how I came up.

30:48.170 --> 30:50.850
That's not how my parents raised me.

30:50.860 --> 30:55.200
I had certain lines that
I didn't let myself cross...

30:55.200 --> 30:58.030
...until now.

30:58.030 --> 31:00.680
You know the thing that's
really messing with my head?

31:02.170 --> 31:04.540
The thing that keeps me up at night,

31:04.550 --> 31:07.030
- the thing I keep thinking?

31:13.550 --> 31:16.030
I'd do it again.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.750
I spent a long time,

31:22.750 --> 31:26.410
- all my life trying to keep it together,

31:26.410 --> 31:29.060
- safe, solid for everyone else.

31:30.860 --> 31:32.410
It's the only thing I know.

31:32.410 --> 31:34.200
Only thing I'm good at.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.230
And it worked.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.200
It got us this far.

31:38.200 --> 31:42.060
Maybe this place needs something else.

31:42.060 --> 31:44.580
Maybe I'm part of the problem.

31:49.750 --> 31:52.230
I don't know.
I'm just tired.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.580
Hey.

32:05.890 --> 32:08.920
Why don't we... go inside-

32:08.920 --> 32:12.130
- and we figure it out together.

32:35.270 --> 32:37.480
Hey.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.300
Hershel, right?

32:39.300 --> 32:40.650
I'm Lance.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.440
Don't know if you remember me.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.680
I've heard you've had-

32:43.680 --> 32:46.650
- a pretty exciting life, young man.

32:46.650 --> 32:50.130
Taken any exciting trips lately?

32:50.130 --> 32:53.480
How about your mom?

32:53.480 --> 32:54.990
The last thing I want, Hershel,

32:54.990 --> 32:57.480
- is for something to happen here,

32:57.480 --> 32:59.820
- especially to your mom.

32:59.820 --> 33:04.850
So I'm gonna need your help.

33:04.860 --> 33:08.480
If I can get the truth,
I can fix things.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.680
That's what I do.

33:10.680 --> 33:14.410
But I can't keep people safe-

33:14.410 --> 33:16.850
- if they keep secrets.

33:16.860 --> 33:20.160
So I want you to think really hard here.

33:20.170 --> 33:22.580
Is there anything you want to tell me?

33:26.510 --> 33:28.680
I should probably go get my mom.

33:28.680 --> 33:31.160
Hey, hold on a second.

33:35.370 --> 33:38.680
You're a good kid... brave.

33:38.680 --> 33:42.340
And the thing about good kids is...

33:42.340 --> 33:45.510
...they deserve presents.

33:45.510 --> 33:46.890
It's funny.

33:46.890 --> 33:48.130
I found this hat all the way back-

33:48.130 --> 33:50.890
- where the bad things happened.

33:50.890 --> 33:54.200
Be a shame for a-a nice
hat like this to go to waste.

33:56.340 --> 33:57.580
Huh!

33:57.580 --> 33:59.030
I'll be damned.

33:59.030 --> 34:01.540
Perfect fit.

34:01.550 --> 34:03.580
What are the odds?

34:05.440 --> 34:07.440
Hey!

34:15.340 --> 34:17.960
Put him down! Go!

34:17.960 --> 34:20.030
Release him or we will shoot.

34:20.030 --> 34:22.060
Let's go!
Move, move!

34:22.060 --> 34:24.100
This guy put his hands on Hershel.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.440
Stand down!

34:25.440 --> 34:27.580
He said something bad
was gonna happen. Whoa!

34:27.580 --> 34:28.820
I can explain.
Back up!

34:28.820 --> 34:30.230
Now!
Got him!

34:30.230 --> 34:33.750
You know, I'm a nice guy, Maggie.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.270
I'll even let you back down-

34:36.270 --> 34:38.230
- so no one gets hurt.

34:38.230 --> 34:39.790
Plenty others have made the mistake-

34:39.790 --> 34:40.989
- of threatening my family.

34:40.989 --> 34:43.230
Most of them are dead now.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.540
And you turned this place upside down-

34:48.550 --> 34:50.230
- and you found nothing.

34:50.230 --> 34:52.610
So unless you want to die for nothing,

34:52.610 --> 34:53.960
- tell them to drop the guns-

34:53.960 --> 34:56.580
- before something really
fucking bad happens.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.610
Everyone lower your weapons.

35:08.610 --> 35:10.610
That's an order.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.300
Back up.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.480
We're leaving.

35:30.440 --> 35:34.480
Sorry if there was any miscommunication.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.160
Shame we couldn't be friends.

36:03.650 --> 36:06.440
We ain't going back to the Commonwealth.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.850
They're keeping us out here to search.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.650
Until they find the killers?

36:10.650 --> 36:12.130
Yeah.

36:12.130 --> 36:14.580
Well, if we can't give them the killers,

36:14.580 --> 36:15.820
- what about those guns?

36:15.820 --> 36:18.510
We find them,
maybe it buys us some time.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.720
That's a big maybe.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.680
Something's about to go down.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.850
Just keep your eyes open.

36:29.510 --> 36:30.850
You find something?

36:30.860 --> 36:33.200
- We did.
- Show me.

36:39.370 --> 36:41.230
You did good.

36:42.890 --> 36:45.410
Theo did most of the hard work.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.440
I have to admit, though...

36:50.440 --> 36:52.410
...it feels special.

36:55.370 --> 36:58.580
After all we've been though,

36:58.580 --> 37:00.920
- as close as I came...

37:05.890 --> 37:08.100
...got a fresh start.

37:10.370 --> 37:13.920
And it was important to
me that my friend know-

37:13.920 --> 37:16.300
- just how much I appreciate her.

37:26.230 --> 37:28.920
It must feel really, really good.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.920
Hey.

37:36.230 --> 37:38.580
What's going on in there?

37:40.230 --> 37:42.610
Just thinking about the world.

37:42.610 --> 37:45.920
That's a big subject.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.790
Anything specific?

37:48.790 --> 37:54.410
Just... all the years...

37:54.410 --> 37:57.440
...the darkness.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.750
After everything,

37:58.750 --> 38:00.960
- in the midst of everything,

38:00.960 --> 38:03.610
- you're sitting here glowing.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.300
The light suits you.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
This light here...

38:13.440 --> 38:16.960
...came from a spark
that you helped me find.

38:19.650 --> 38:21.820
Darkness is heavy.

38:21.820 --> 38:24.790
Some of us carry more than others-

38:24.790 --> 38:27.680
- because we're strong
enough to hold the weight.

38:30.300 --> 38:33.300
But we make the light.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.990
Hey.

38:35.990 --> 38:38.480
You make the light, Carol.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.990
You know that, don't you?

38:52.650 --> 38:55.000
You know we're not
getting back together, right?

38:59.300 --> 39:02.200
Yeah, you keep saying that.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.510
Ezekiel, we need you back here!

39:06.170 --> 39:07.850
It burst, the appendix.

39:07.860 --> 39:09.060
We need to get her to a hospital.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.340
No, no.
There's no time.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.610
Either we clean the abdomen now-

39:12.610 --> 39:14.200
- or peritonitis sets in.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.030
Move her and it will be too late.

39:16.030 --> 39:18.030
I can do this... trust me.

39:18.030 --> 39:19.340
I know you can.
How can we help?

39:19.340 --> 39:21.030
Ezekiel, take over bagging.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.850
Uh, Theo, go back to the hospital,

39:22.860 --> 39:24.200
- get more antibiotics.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.720
Take this clamp, hold tight.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.030
Mm-hmm.
Take this.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.060
Get more gauze.

39:32.060 --> 39:34.680
Alright, let me...
Let me in there.

39:40.860 --> 39:43.680
Gauze.

39:43.680 --> 39:47.540
Oh, God.

39:47.550 --> 39:48.850
Okay.

39:48.860 --> 39:50.060
Move it back.

39:50.060 --> 39:51.720
Little further, little further.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.100
There it is.

39:57.860 --> 40:00.060
Gauze.

40:14.550 --> 40:16.580
Gauze.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.920
That's good, Ezekiel.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.580
Okay.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.920
Now we have to flush the cavity.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.480
Carol, saline.

40:42.230 --> 40:44.790
We'll know more over the next 24 hours,

40:44.790 --> 40:47.510
- but it looks good.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.790
See?

40:50.790 --> 40:52.990
Small procedure.

40:52.990 --> 40:54.720
Nothing to worry about.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.790
Can we talk?

40:59.790 --> 41:01.650
Yeah.

41:04.990 --> 41:08.510
I, uh...
I regret my earlier ambush.

41:08.510 --> 41:10.990
It was mighty uncool of me.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.820
If the stuff that you
mentioned is happening here,

41:13.820 --> 41:15.750
- it's bad.

41:15.750 --> 41:17.060
Really bad.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.480
Well, it was not my intention
to put you in a tight spot.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.510
If this arrangement makes
you uncomfortable...

41:21.510 --> 41:23.160
It does.

41:23.170 --> 41:26.440
The idea of continuing to sneak around-

41:26.440 --> 41:27.820
- just when I had hoped-

41:27.820 --> 41:31.680
- that things might go back to normal...

41:37.030 --> 41:38.650
Maybe I'm not built for this.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.750
But I don't think I have a choice.

41:43.750 --> 41:46.680
Hey.

41:46.680 --> 41:48.820
Of course you do.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.160
My friends and I will find another avenue.

41:51.170 --> 41:52.410
No.

41:52.410 --> 41:56.200
Eugene, that's not what I meant.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.680
There is no choice because...

41:59.680 --> 42:03.200
...there is no back to normal.

42:03.200 --> 42:05.200
We know what we know.

42:05.200 --> 42:09.030
And because of that,
things have to change.

42:09.030 --> 42:12.580
I can't wait around for someone
else to step up and help.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.200
I can promise you this.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.510
Whatever we find,
whatever comes our way,

42:27.510 --> 42:29.410
- you will not face it alone.

42:29.410 --> 42:31.990
I'll be by your side,
hell or high water.

42:33.230 --> 42:34.890
You sure?

42:34.890 --> 42:37.440
Against all odds of the
cosmos and humankind,

42:37.440 --> 42:40.920
- we found one another.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.890
I've never been more
certain of anything in my life.

43:05.270 --> 43:09.650
So...
what do I need to steal?

44:02.300 --> 44:04.990
Wait!
Hold your fire!

44:04.990 --> 44:06.490
We're here to talk.

44:11.480 --> 44:14.160
We've come a long way to find you.

44:17.170 --> 44:19.720
You were not easy to track down.

44:26.340 --> 44:30.160
But since you've caused me
more than a handful of trouble,

44:30.170 --> 44:32.340
- the least you can do is
hear what I have to say-

44:32.340 --> 44:34.340
- before you kill us.

44:49.860 --> 44:51.960
Talk fast.

44:55.550 --> 44:58.680
My name is Lance Hornsby.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.230
And I'm here to offer you a job.

45:10.990 --> 45:13.930
And I'm here to offer you a job.
I'll need to see her when she's dead.

45:13.960 --> 45:15.460
This a fight that I'm in...

45:17.580 --> 45:20.030
...It's not gonna end until I end it.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.100
I'm doing this my way.

45:22.370 --> 45:24.990
Your way got my men killed.

45:25.270 --> 45:27.510
We find our moment, we take it.

45:27.790 --> 45:30.720
We are in this until we find
a way to fight our way out.

45:44.060 --> 45:47.860
This place has a way of lulling you.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.420
Why upset the applecart-

45:49.580 --> 45:52.340
- if it's keeping you safe, right?

45:52.610 --> 45:55.200
That is the struggle...

45:55.480 --> 45:59.170
Protecting ourselves or others?

45:59.440 --> 46:00.680
I wouldn't mind both.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.230
We had this storyline with Ezekiel-

46:03.510 --> 46:04.610
- and Tomi and Carol-

46:04.890 --> 46:06.890
- where they got to go and do a surgery.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.830
So, the director that
we had for this episode-

46:08.860 --> 46:10.360
- is named Lily Mariye.

46:10.580 --> 46:12.660
She's an amazing director,
but one of the other things-

46:12.680 --> 46:15.990
- about her is that she was
a long time cast member-

46:16.100 --> 46:18.100
- on the series "ER."

46:18.370 --> 46:20.300
So, we had to do a surgery on this,

46:20.580 --> 46:22.680
- and it was this funny
thing where we had-

46:22.750 --> 46:25.660
- the perfect director who's like,
"Oh, I've been in those scenes.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.900
I know exactly how to
do like a hospital scene."

46:27.920 --> 46:30.420
So that was really fun,
and it just wound up being-

46:30.550 --> 46:32.990
- like this happy
accident to tell this story.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.550
Good morning.

46:40.820 --> 46:43.020
It's so fun to write
for Princess and Mercer.

46:43.370 --> 46:45.680
They're so great as individuals,
and I think-

46:45.960 --> 46:48.920
- their scenes together are just so sweet-

46:49.410 --> 46:51.560
- and the way that
they play the characters-

46:51.680 --> 46:54.270
- with such nuance and loveliness.

46:54.580 --> 46:56.130
We're both adults.

46:56.610 --> 46:58.970
I've had a lot of sex,
and you've had a lot of sex.

46:58.990 --> 47:01.920
I love listening to you talk.

47:02.410 --> 47:03.910
And, of course, the sex.

47:04.060 --> 47:06.610
Paola, who plays Princess,
is so, so funny.

47:06.890 --> 47:09.340
But I love that with
Mercer we also get to see-

47:09.610 --> 47:11.760
- this side of her
that's like more serious-

47:11.820 --> 47:13.320
- and earnest, you know?

47:13.440 --> 47:17.130
And I might put out this totally sexy,

47:17.410 --> 47:20.130
- carefree, fun-times vibe,

47:20.410 --> 47:22.580
- but I can handle heavy stuff too-

47:22.860 --> 47:23.860
- if you ever need it.

47:23.990 --> 47:25.690
I think Michael, who plays Mercer,

47:25.820 --> 47:30.300
- is just such a meticulous
actor in like the very best way.

47:30.750 --> 47:34.610
Like, it is so lovely to work
with, and he's so smart about-

47:34.860 --> 47:36.910
- how he approaches this character, like,

47:37.030 --> 47:41.650
- really thinks so deeply about
every line and every word.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.200
I killed two of my men.

47:46.480 --> 47:47.480
And I covered it up.

47:47.610 --> 47:48.730
When those two get together,

47:48.990 --> 47:50.690
- we always know we're
going to get this, like,

47:50.720 --> 47:55.060
- lovely, well thought out
emotional scene back-

47:55.510 --> 47:59.100
- that is really fun to watch
and romantic and all of that.

47:59.200 --> 48:00.700
This is not a good look.

48:00.890 --> 48:02.840
It puts all of us in a very tough spot.

48:03.030 --> 48:05.340
Problem or not, it's the truth.

48:05.610 --> 48:07.340
The scene where Aaron and Gabriel-

48:07.820 --> 48:11.230
- are just straight-up lying
to Hornsby is just really fun.

48:11.510 --> 48:13.990
Seth and Ross as Gabriel and Aaron,

48:14.480 --> 48:16.510
- they're very, very funny in real life.

48:16.790 --> 48:19.680
And so their characters
tend to be so serious-

48:19.960 --> 48:22.800
- because the show is serious,
but we like when we can have-

48:22.820 --> 48:25.270
- those moments of kind
of like dark comedy in it.

48:25.510 --> 48:27.010
That's your story?

48:29.030 --> 48:30.620
- That's basically it, yeah.
- Yeah.

48:30.650 --> 48:31.750
- Yeah.
- Yes.

48:32.030 --> 48:34.410
There is dark humor that comes through-

48:34.680 --> 48:36.680
- in like every person in this scene-

48:36.960 --> 48:39.260
- knowing that every
other person in the scene-

48:39.510 --> 48:40.510
- is playing a game.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.180
Okay.
Fair enough.

48:42.230 --> 48:43.590
I'm not trying to ruffle
any feathers here.

48:43.610 --> 48:44.650
I've just got a job to do.

48:44.860 --> 48:46.660
And yet they're just gonna all pretend-

48:46.680 --> 48:49.380
- like there's no game being
played, this is the truth.

48:54.820 --> 48:56.620
Why don't you two take care of this?

48:56.860 --> 48:57.890
Are you serious?

48:58.170 --> 49:00.060
We have to save our ammunition.

49:00.510 --> 49:02.370
I was told you can handle yourselves.

49:02.650 --> 49:04.610
Where's the problem?

49:04.890 --> 49:07.820
There's multiple people
in danger right now.

49:08.100 --> 49:10.960
Daryl, Aaron and Gabriel,
if they're like really-

49:11.230 --> 49:14.200
- found out to be lying
or they kind of confront,

49:14.270 --> 49:15.770
- they are in danger.

49:15.990 --> 49:19.100
All of them have children that
are back at Commonwealth,

49:19.550 --> 49:22.750
- all of them have loved ones that
are back at the Commonwealth.

49:23.030 --> 49:25.720
Given what just happened
with Sebastian for example-

49:25.990 --> 49:28.040
- with Daryl, there may be a willingness-

49:28.270 --> 49:31.270
- to mess with their kids or
mess with their loved ones,

49:31.550 --> 49:33.480
- and so they don't trust that.

49:33.750 --> 49:35.990
You expect me to trust him?

49:36.270 --> 49:38.480
I ain't asking you to trust him.

49:38.750 --> 49:40.440
I'm asking you to trust me.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.820
They know that Maggie is in trouble.

49:43.100 --> 49:45.510
Gabriel and Aaron very,
very well know-

49:45.790 --> 49:47.560
- and are kind of like communicating-

49:47.580 --> 49:49.100
- via telepathy to Daryl.

49:49.580 --> 49:51.210
You know,
they got the looks going and stuff,

49:51.230 --> 49:53.130
- Daryl is like reading the situation-

49:53.610 --> 49:55.960
- and doing his tracking
and going like, "Okay",

49:56.130 --> 49:58.480
- I have kind of an idea
of what happened here."

49:58.680 --> 50:00.480
So I think they feel that by going-

50:00.960 --> 50:04.650
- with Hornsby and the troopers,
they can keep an eye on them,

50:04.920 --> 50:07.510
- and really, it's a selfless
move on the behalf-

50:07.790 --> 50:10.340
- of Daryl and Aaron
and Gabriel to go along-

50:10.610 --> 50:11.870
- with something that they very much-

50:11.890 --> 50:13.010
- do not want to be a part of.

50:13.270 --> 50:15.000
And it's for the good
of the people back home,

50:15.030 --> 50:17.200
- it's for good of people at the Hilltop.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.920
There's this tension around,
like, is that truck gonna start.

50:28.170 --> 50:30.790
All of that is meant to
play with like a feeling-

50:31.060 --> 50:33.370
- of could they be discovered at any point.

50:39.060 --> 50:41.170
Hornsby already knows the story.

50:41.610 --> 50:46.920
He is like 98.9 percent certain
when he walks in the doors-

50:47.200 --> 50:50.340
- that Maggie was there,
that she knows what happened-

50:50.790 --> 50:54.300
- to the people that were there,
and all he's looking for-

50:54.610 --> 50:55.680
- is the smoking gun.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.280
Plenty others have made the mistake-

50:57.300 --> 50:58.440
- of threatening my family.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.370
Most of them are dead now.

51:01.860 --> 51:04.550
This is not something
that we wanted to build to,

51:04.820 --> 51:06.660
- like, people firing guns at each other.

51:06.680 --> 51:09.510
Like, that's not really
where they're at in the story.

51:09.990 --> 51:13.990
But we did want to feel like
this is a fraught situation,

51:14.270 --> 51:16.440
- it is a dangerous situation in some ways,

51:16.890 --> 51:20.750
- because if Maggie and others
are found to be interfering-

51:21.030 --> 51:22.920
- in the affairs of the Commonwealth,

51:23.200 --> 51:25.200
- this might lead to a bad end for them.
