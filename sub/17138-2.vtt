WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.472
My name is Sara Lance.

00:02.601 --> 00:05.570
Last year, a former Time Master
named Rip Hunter recruited

00:05.572 --> 00:08.436
a team of heroes and villains
to save the world, and we did,

00:08.586 --> 00:11.521
but in the process we
destroyed the Time Masters.

00:11.523 --> 00:13.289
Now we've taken up their mantle

00:13.291 --> 00:15.859
of protecting the timeline
from time criminals.

00:15.861 --> 00:18.194
We are no longer saving the world.

00:18.196 --> 00:19.429
We are saving history.

00:20.565 --> 00:22.932
But don't call us heroes.

00:22.934 --> 00:25.702
We are legends.

00:25.704 --> 00:27.770
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:27.772 --> 00:29.205
Heywood. Dr. Nate Heywood.

00:29.207 --> 00:31.441
I need to talk to you about
Sara Lance, Ray Palmer,

00:31.443 --> 00:33.510
and the rest of the Legends.

00:33.512 --> 00:34.744
I think they're all in trouble.

00:34.746 --> 00:36.379
I am piloting us on a collision course

00:36.381 --> 00:37.413
with a torpedo.

00:40.418 --> 00:42.852
- Gideon.
- I'm here, Captain.

00:44.289 --> 00:45.955
Where's Captain Hunter?

00:45.957 --> 00:48.222
I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.

00:48.223 --> 00:49.726
Together, you are the best crew,

00:49.728 --> 00:52.929
the best team a captain
could ever hope for.

00:52.931 --> 00:53.963
Good luck.

00:53.965 --> 00:56.499
What do you guys say we get out of 1942?

00:56.501 --> 00:58.501
Not until you answer a few questions.

01:02.107 --> 01:04.173
We're the Justice Society of America.

01:04.175 --> 01:05.875
And you're coming with us.

01:05.877 --> 01:06.876
Oh, my God.

01:06.878 --> 01:08.478
You're Commander Steel.

01:11.515 --> 01:13.082
Who the hell are you?

01:13.084 --> 01:14.517
- Whoa, whoa.
- Just relax.

01:14.519 --> 01:15.852
We're all friends here.

01:15.854 --> 01:17.520
Rex Tyler told us about the JSA.

01:17.522 --> 01:18.721
You guys are awesome.

01:18.723 --> 01:20.823
Hey. The name's Jax.

01:20.825 --> 01:22.825
Rex never mentioned any of you.

01:22.827 --> 01:24.127
Mind telling us what you were doing

01:24.129 --> 01:25.261
impersonating OSS agents?

01:25.263 --> 01:26.763
It's quite simple, actually.

01:26.765 --> 01:29.699
We were protecting Albert
Einstein from Nazi agents

01:29.701 --> 01:31.434
who were attempting to kidnap him

01:31.436 --> 01:33.836
and force him to build an atomic bomb

01:33.838 --> 01:35.371
in the future.

01:35.373 --> 01:37.473
Time travel. It's... it's hard to explain.

01:37.475 --> 01:39.309
You can take all the time you need.

01:39.311 --> 01:40.777
In custody.

01:40.779 --> 01:43.680
Whoa, take it easy.
Let's talk for a minute.

01:43.682 --> 01:44.922
I mean, after all, you're my...

01:52.457 --> 01:54.624
Obsidian, shut off the lights!

01:56.795 --> 01:58.895
Wow, that's pretty neat.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.448 --> 02:18.047
She's trying to kill us!

02:18.049 --> 02:19.415
Nah, she's just flirting.

02:33.298 --> 02:35.898
We don't want to fight!

02:50.215 --> 02:51.215
You win!

03:25.783 --> 03:28.651
You just had to mention
time travel, didn't you?

03:28.653 --> 03:31.087
Yeah, well, at least he
didn't throw the first punch.

03:31.089 --> 03:33.796
I'm perfectly capable of
defending myself, Raymond.

03:33.855 --> 03:35.254
I'm pretty sure that you got knocked out

03:35.256 --> 03:37.389
by a teenager in a star-spangled leotard.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.724
Her name's Stargirl.

03:38.726 --> 03:40.626
Did anybody catch her
regular-person name?

03:40.628 --> 03:42.561
I'm surprised you
didn't ask for her number.

03:42.563 --> 03:45.130
Oh, so it's my fault that
we got our asses handed to us?

03:45.132 --> 03:47.066
Look, they're just better
coordinated than us.

03:47.068 --> 03:48.234
You guys, just listen to me for two...

03:48.236 --> 03:49.244
Pretty, shut up.

03:49.245 --> 03:51.136
If I recall, you were late
coming to the party.

03:51.138 --> 03:52.805
Oh, is that right? How did you see that?

03:52.807 --> 03:54.907
Never laid eyes on
them before in my life.

03:54.909 --> 03:57.810
They seemed quite
adamant that they knew you.

03:57.812 --> 04:00.212
Believe me, if I'd met this bunch,

04:00.214 --> 04:01.747
pretty sure I'd remember.

04:01.749 --> 04:02.882
What do you propose we do with 'em?

04:02.884 --> 04:04.850
If I may be so bold, sir,

04:04.852 --> 04:06.485
I say we find the darkest hole

04:06.487 --> 04:08.487
in Leavenworth and throw away the key.

04:08.489 --> 04:12.258
I say we ship 'em to the boys in
Bellevue Mental Hospital.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.827
I suppose before we do anything,

04:14.829 --> 04:15.928
we ought to question them.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.596
So far up Mr. Goggle's...

04:19.432 --> 04:21.600
If we can even manage to get a word in.

04:21.601 --> 04:22.735
I don't understand why they were

04:22.737 --> 04:24.303
tracking us in the first place.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.205
Because they're the
Justice Society of America,

04:26.207 --> 04:29.074
the single greatest secret force
this country has ever known.

04:29.076 --> 04:31.710
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

04:31.712 --> 04:34.947
Because his Nazi handlers
have briefed him, no doubt.

04:34.949 --> 04:37.650
- Look, I'm not a Nazi.
- I'm a historian.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.119
Here we go with the time
travel nonsense again.

04:40.121 --> 04:42.054
070233.

04:43.124 --> 04:44.456
What?

04:44.458 --> 04:46.892
Those are numbers on your dog tags.

04:46.894 --> 04:48.494
They're not disclosed on any documents,

04:48.496 --> 04:50.763
military or otherwise.

04:50.765 --> 04:52.398
How do you know that?

04:58.706 --> 05:00.773
You gave these to your wife

05:00.775 --> 05:03.909
after the birth of your son in 1955.

05:03.911 --> 05:06.178
The dent in the front was
from an assassin's bullet

05:06.180 --> 05:09.315
when you saved President
Roosevelt in 1939.

05:09.317 --> 05:12.751
Your son passed them down to his son,

05:12.753 --> 05:14.520
me.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.699
You are late, Herr Thawne.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.233
You'll find that I have

05:28.235 --> 05:32.237
an entirely different
concept of time than most.

05:32.239 --> 05:33.572
Did you located the item?

05:33.574 --> 05:35.607
It's in Berlin.

05:35.609 --> 05:37.710
The Fuehrer refuses to part with it.

05:37.712 --> 05:41.046
I have something much
more valuable to offer him.

05:41.048 --> 05:44.917
The JSA are basically a
group of super-soldiers.

05:44.919 --> 05:49.054
To win, the Reich will need their own.

05:49.056 --> 05:50.723
This is just a taste.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.392
Enough to dose one person.

05:53.394 --> 05:56.028
Proof of concept.

05:56.030 --> 05:57.830
Give me what I want

05:57.832 --> 06:00.699
and your Fuehrer
will be planting his flag

06:00.701 --> 06:04.103
on the White House lawn
within a matter of months.

06:08.109 --> 06:10.809
Do we have an accord?

06:15.779 --> 06:17.449
Mr. Tyler.

06:17.451 --> 06:19.118
See? Rex Tyler.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.352
Told you we knew the guy.

06:20.354 --> 06:21.687
I don't know you.

06:21.689 --> 06:22.855
Any of you.

06:22.857 --> 06:24.199
Tell me what the heck is going on here.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.706
- Well, we tried explaining...
- I'm sorry, ma'am,

06:26.709 --> 06:28.676
I was addressing the team leader.

06:28.678 --> 06:29.677
Uh... uh... oh.

06:29.679 --> 06:31.212
Oh, well, simply put,

06:31.214 --> 06:33.381
we've come here as time travelers

06:33.383 --> 06:36.584
to identify aberrations in
history and correct them.

06:36.586 --> 06:38.085
We're superheroes, like you guys.

06:38.087 --> 06:40.621
You think you're just like us?

06:40.623 --> 06:42.289
What are your qualifications?

06:42.291 --> 06:43.924
Well, I used my personal fortune

06:43.926 --> 06:45.693
to create an advanced exo-skeleton,

06:45.695 --> 06:47.395
which is powered by dwarf star alloy.

06:47.397 --> 06:50.297
And I'm nothing like you. I'm a criminal.

06:50.299 --> 06:52.900
Are there any other felons on your team?

06:52.902 --> 06:54.368
- No, no...
- Yes.

06:54.370 --> 06:58.038
She's an assassin,
but never convicted, right?

06:58.040 --> 07:00.608
We're protecting history.
It's pretty important.

07:00.610 --> 07:02.943
In the future, you risk your own life

07:02.945 --> 07:05.946
to save us, Mr. Tyler.

07:05.948 --> 07:07.448
How do you know my name?

07:07.450 --> 07:09.450
Because you told us your name

07:09.452 --> 07:11.485
in 2016.

07:11.487 --> 07:13.587
My name is Rex Tyler,

07:13.589 --> 07:16.524
and I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.

07:16.526 --> 07:18.359
Never heard of 'em, pal.

07:18.361 --> 07:20.394
That's because I'm from 1942.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.463
The same year in which all of you will...

07:22.465 --> 07:24.064
Bite the bullet?

07:24.066 --> 07:27.268
So if we don't go back to 1942,
we're safe, right?

07:27.270 --> 07:28.536
Not to be rude,

07:28.538 --> 07:30.871
but how do we know you
are who you say you are?

07:30.873 --> 07:33.207
You all have no idea
what you're up against.

07:34.710 --> 07:38.078
If you return to 1942,
the consequences will be

07:38.080 --> 07:39.547
catastrophic.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.586
That was weird.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.425
So I crashed your ship,

07:51.427 --> 07:54.061
told you some bunk about
not staying in 1942,

07:54.063 --> 07:56.597
and then I just disappeared?

07:56.599 --> 07:59.733
It was more like "fritzing" out.

07:59.735 --> 08:00.801
You might've been on to something

08:00.803 --> 08:02.169
with the Bellevue idea.

08:06.675 --> 08:07.975
Yes, Mr. President, sir?

08:07.977 --> 08:09.143
FDR?

08:09.145 --> 08:12.980
Oh, tell him I'm a big
fan of the New Deal.

08:12.982 --> 08:15.149
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about earlier.

08:15.151 --> 08:16.584
I just, uh,

08:16.586 --> 08:19.220
I never imagined meeting you like this.

08:19.222 --> 08:21.222
I actually never imagined
meeting you at all

08:21.224 --> 08:24.959
because you're dead.

08:24.961 --> 08:28.362
I mean, where I come from,
you're... you're dead.

08:28.364 --> 08:32.600
My dad used to tell me
bedtime stories about you.

08:33.769 --> 08:35.769
All the battles you fought.

08:35.770 --> 08:37.505
You're a hero to me.

08:37.506 --> 08:39.840
I'm a hero to a lot of people.

08:39.842 --> 08:42.142
That's the job.

08:42.144 --> 08:44.378
Of course. All right.

08:44.380 --> 08:46.947
You can count on us, sir.

08:46.949 --> 08:48.349
All right, we have to move out.

08:48.351 --> 08:50.184
Baron Krieger's been spotted in Paris.

08:50.186 --> 08:51.652
If it's permissible, sir,

08:51.654 --> 08:53.787
I'll fly ahead and record
Krieger's movements.

08:53.789 --> 08:55.890
Sensible, as always.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.959
We could help you out with that.

08:58.961 --> 09:00.861
Fighting Nazis is kind of our thing.

09:00.863 --> 09:02.563
Yeah. Last time we tried,

09:02.565 --> 09:04.899
we ended up at the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean.

09:04.901 --> 09:07.401
We can handle Adolf's buddies.

09:07.403 --> 09:09.803
I think it's best for
the 20th Century if...

09:09.805 --> 09:12.172
For us to leave it?

09:12.174 --> 09:15.075
And that's why you're team leader.

09:15.077 --> 09:18.145
Well, I guess we'll be on our way, then.

09:20.483 --> 09:22.917
Can you believe what we
just saw with our own eyes?

09:22.919 --> 09:24.218
The actual JSA.

09:24.220 --> 09:26.687
And Hourman? That guy's amazing.

09:26.689 --> 09:29.323
Aw, haircut's in love.

09:29.325 --> 09:31.559
Come on.

09:31.561 --> 09:33.694
Those guys were precise, professional,

09:33.696 --> 09:34.995
in constant agreement.

09:34.997 --> 09:36.096
We can't even agree on

09:36.098 --> 09:37.531
whose turn it is to make dinner.

09:37.533 --> 09:38.465
Not it.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.100
I can't argue with you, man.

09:40.102 --> 09:41.468
They got some serious skills.

09:41.470 --> 09:42.736
Big deal.

09:42.738 --> 09:45.806
Apart from the fancy
headquarters, discipline,

09:45.808 --> 09:47.675
and calls from the White House,

09:47.677 --> 09:49.843
I mean, what do they have that we don't?

09:49.845 --> 09:51.745
An actual leader.

09:51.747 --> 09:53.013
Rip's gone,

09:53.015 --> 09:54.615
and who knows when or if

09:54.617 --> 09:56.116
we'll ever find him.

09:56.118 --> 09:57.484
In the meantime,

09:57.486 --> 09:59.520
we need someone who can
make the tough calls.

09:59.522 --> 10:01.855
Let me guess, you're volunteering?

10:01.857 --> 10:03.290
With all due respect, Raymond,

10:03.292 --> 10:05.426
I think there's a reason
Mr. Tyler just naturally

10:05.428 --> 10:08.362
assumed I was in charge.

10:08.364 --> 10:11.932
Yeah, because Mr. Tyler is from 1942

10:11.934 --> 10:14.635
and you're some old white dude.

10:14.637 --> 10:16.437
"Old," meaning

10:16.439 --> 10:17.705
experienced.

10:17.707 --> 10:19.673
- What about...
- Martin's right.

10:19.675 --> 10:22.543
With Rip gone, we could use
some adult supervision.

10:22.545 --> 10:24.311
Congratulations,

10:24.313 --> 10:26.580
Captain.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.048
Well, then.

10:28.050 --> 10:29.683
Thank you all for your support.

10:29.685 --> 10:31.752
Now, I believe our first order of business

10:31.754 --> 10:34.922
concerns Dr. Heywood.

10:41.497 --> 10:43.163
Is that Grandpa?

10:43.165 --> 10:44.698
Yeah.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.233
Pictures of him are hard to find.

10:46.235 --> 10:47.601
You just got to know where to look.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.169
Well, that must've been something,

10:49.171 --> 10:52.006
getting the chance to meet him.

10:52.008 --> 10:53.374
You would think so, right?

10:53.376 --> 10:56.810
But... I don't know.

10:56.812 --> 10:59.647
Felt empty somehow.

10:59.649 --> 11:02.583
Well, meeting your idols usually does.

11:02.585 --> 11:04.051
Think of it this way.

11:04.053 --> 11:06.086
You are gonna have one hell of a story

11:06.088 --> 11:08.355
to tell your friends when
you get back home.

11:08.357 --> 11:11.258
Back home? 2016 back home?

11:11.260 --> 11:12.660
You can't cut me from the team.

11:12.662 --> 11:13.861
Well, you're right,

11:13.863 --> 11:16.430
because you're not a member of it.

11:16.432 --> 11:20.134
And even if you were,
history can be dangerous,

11:20.136 --> 11:21.535
and it's no place for a...

11:21.537 --> 11:22.670
A historian?

11:22.672 --> 11:25.773
I'm more than...

11:25.775 --> 11:26.874
that's weird.

11:26.876 --> 11:28.175
It's really not so weird.

11:28.177 --> 11:29.309
You don't have any superpowers.

11:29.311 --> 11:30.577
You don't even have training...

11:30.579 --> 11:33.347
Not that. My grandfather's dog tags.

11:33.349 --> 11:34.815
They aren't around my neck.

11:34.817 --> 11:36.316
So?

11:36.318 --> 11:37.751
So I haven't taken
'em off since I was a kid.

11:37.753 --> 11:39.953
They were here a minute ago,
and now they've...

11:39.955 --> 11:41.655
Vanished.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.157
What does that mean?

11:43.159 --> 11:44.992
That history has changed.

11:48.597 --> 11:50.130
What are you doing?

11:50.132 --> 11:53.267
Reviewing my notes on the JSA.

11:55.003 --> 11:57.938
We have to go back to 1942.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.174
Nate, the JSA was pretty explicit

12:00.176 --> 12:02.509
on us not going back to 1942.

12:02.511 --> 12:04.011
That mission the JSA went on

12:04.013 --> 12:07.681
to track down Baron Krieger in Paris,

12:07.683 --> 12:09.516
they're all gonna die there tomorrow.

12:11.754 --> 12:13.554
My grandfather too.

12:17.915 --> 12:20.599
_

12:20.609 --> 12:23.077
And this is where the JSA's gonna die?

12:23.079 --> 12:24.178
Not unless we save them,

12:24.180 --> 12:26.114
including my grandfather.

12:26.116 --> 12:27.849
Well, first we got to find them.

12:27.851 --> 12:29.751
Fortunately, we know they're looking for

12:29.753 --> 12:32.387
a Nazi named Krieger.

12:32.389 --> 12:33.821
A Nazi named Krieger...

12:33.823 --> 12:35.423
can someone please help
me operate this thing?

12:35.425 --> 12:36.524
Oh, God.

12:36.526 --> 12:37.725
Thank you.

12:37.727 --> 12:40.495
Krieger and his men
frequent Folies-Bergère.

12:40.497 --> 12:43.264
We find Krieger, we find the JSA.

12:43.266 --> 12:46.200
So how do we sneak into a Nazi nightclub?

12:46.202 --> 12:48.303
I have a plan.

12:48.305 --> 12:50.605
Are any of you familiar
with Max Suelzenfuss,

12:50.607 --> 12:52.607
better known by his stage name,

12:52.609 --> 12:54.008
Max Lorenz?

12:54.010 --> 12:56.811
He was Hitler's favorite
singer and, fortunately,

12:56.813 --> 13:00.982
bears a passing resemblance to moi.

13:00.984 --> 13:02.417
That's French.

13:02.419 --> 13:03.818
Hm.

13:03.820 --> 13:05.620
Grey.

13:05.622 --> 13:07.088
Are you sure about this?

13:07.090 --> 13:08.823
'Cause bluffing at a
card game isn't exactly

13:08.825 --> 13:10.358
the same as bluffing Nazis.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.160
You disapprove of my plan?

13:12.162 --> 13:13.628
I'm just saying, we're
dropping into the middle

13:13.630 --> 13:16.030
of World War II here,
and you're not exactly

13:16.032 --> 13:18.132
a wartime consigliere.

13:18.134 --> 13:20.601
- And let me guess, you are?
- I...

13:20.603 --> 13:23.938
Or perhaps you would prefer
the arsonist, the assassin,

13:23.940 --> 13:25.873
or the incredible shrinking man?

13:25.875 --> 13:27.275
I'm just saying,

13:27.277 --> 13:29.978
you're smart and analytical and stuff,

13:29.980 --> 13:31.379
and real deliberate,

13:31.381 --> 13:33.047
but when bullets start flying,

13:33.049 --> 13:34.649
analytical's not gonna cut it.

13:34.651 --> 13:36.851
Well, thank you for pointing
out my inadequacies.

13:36.853 --> 13:37.919
Come on, Grey.

13:37.921 --> 13:41.255
It's Captain Grey now.

13:41.257 --> 13:43.291
Well, I'm glad it hasn't
gone to your head.

13:46.329 --> 13:49.130
Ouch. Where'd you get that?

13:49.132 --> 13:50.798
Uh, it must have happened

13:50.800 --> 13:53.901
when I fell after my
grandfather decked me.

13:53.903 --> 13:56.170
Hey, that fabrication room's pretty cool.

13:56.172 --> 13:58.406
Can it really make clothes from any era?

13:58.408 --> 14:00.141
Yeah, you know, we may not have trophies

14:00.143 --> 14:01.876
or framed letters from former presidents,

14:01.878 --> 14:04.479
but we've got a few cool toys.

14:04.481 --> 14:07.548
Including ingestible translator.

14:07.550 --> 14:08.649
Swallow this,

14:08.651 --> 14:10.218
you'll be able to speak and understand

14:10.220 --> 14:12.053
any language spoken to you.

14:12.055 --> 14:13.521
That's cool, but I already speak

14:13.523 --> 14:16.758
German, French, Japanese,
Italian, and Latin.

14:16.760 --> 14:17.959
What?

14:17.961 --> 14:19.761
You speak six different languages;

14:19.763 --> 14:21.496
you have a tendency to
run towards danger;

14:21.498 --> 14:24.232
and you're related to
a member of the JSA.

14:24.234 --> 14:26.067
Why did you become a historian?

14:26.069 --> 14:27.668
It's a long story.

14:27.670 --> 14:28.836
Um, hey, where do I go

14:28.838 --> 14:31.472
to get a gun?

14:31.474 --> 14:33.041
You ever shoot someone before?

14:33.043 --> 14:34.675
I mean, I may not be trained by

14:34.677 --> 14:35.977
the League of Assassins,

14:35.979 --> 14:37.745
but I can take care of myself.

14:37.747 --> 14:39.380
Not out here you can't.

14:39.382 --> 14:41.282
Out here, even the strongest

14:41.284 --> 14:43.051
and the bravest of us die.

14:43.053 --> 14:46.654
Like Captain Hunter?

14:46.656 --> 14:49.357
I'm just trying to make sure
you get home safe and sound.

14:52.162 --> 14:53.795
So the lady does have a heart.

14:53.797 --> 14:55.396
Don't tell anyone.

15:02.872 --> 15:04.338
Excuse me...

15:04.340 --> 15:07.842
The club is closed tonight
for a private function.

15:07.844 --> 15:10.912
Do you have any idea who I am?

15:10.914 --> 15:13.915
I am Max Lorenz.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.516
- Did you say Max Lorenz?
- Yes.

15:15.518 --> 15:18.920
And I have never been
treated with such rudeness.

15:18.922 --> 15:20.154
Of course not.

15:20.156 --> 15:22.590
You're more than welcome here, Herr Max.

15:22.592 --> 15:24.392
Thank you.

15:44.446 --> 15:46.147
No sign of Krieger or the JSA.

15:46.149 --> 15:48.483
Canvass the area and stay on the comms.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.500
Think I got something.

15:52.502 --> 15:54.402
The lady with the animal powers.

15:54.404 --> 15:57.105
But she looks different.

15:57.107 --> 15:58.807
You mean hot.

16:02.111 --> 16:04.479
May I?

16:07.116 --> 16:08.516
What are you doing?

16:08.518 --> 16:10.151
I'm on a covert mission.

16:10.153 --> 16:11.686
Not for long.

16:11.688 --> 16:15.023
You and your team are all 24
hours away from being killed.

16:15.025 --> 16:16.358
What are you talking about?

16:16.360 --> 16:19.160
I'm a time traveler, remember?

16:19.162 --> 16:20.695
Something changes in the future,

16:20.697 --> 16:23.798
and you all die.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.233
But if we do,

16:25.235 --> 16:28.470
how do you know it's not
because of your team?

16:28.472 --> 16:30.972
Hadn't thought of that.

16:30.974 --> 16:32.474
Look who I found,

16:32.476 --> 16:33.875
and she's thrilled
we've offered our help.

16:33.877 --> 16:36.244
Herr Lorenz, I must introduce you

16:36.246 --> 16:38.847
to General Gerd von Rundstedt.

16:38.849 --> 16:39.814
He's a huge fan.

16:39.816 --> 16:41.983
Oh, lovely to meet you, General.

16:41.985 --> 16:44.619
You are Max Lorenz?

16:44.621 --> 16:47.555
Lorenz is well over 6 feet tall.

16:47.557 --> 16:48.623
Ah.

16:48.625 --> 16:51.593
My towering voice often causes people

16:51.595 --> 16:54.696
to overestimate my height.

16:54.698 --> 16:58.299
Perhaps you will treat us
to a song, Mr. Lorenz?

16:58.301 --> 17:00.168
Maxie has a concert tomorrow night

17:00.170 --> 17:02.871
and needs to rest his pipes.

17:02.873 --> 17:05.272
I insist, Fraulein.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.242
And, uh, please,

17:08.244 --> 17:10.878
no Negro music.

17:10.881 --> 17:11.945
- I sw...
- Mm,

17:11.948 --> 17:13.381
not worth it.

17:13.383 --> 17:15.916
It'd be a little worth it.

17:15.919 --> 17:19.954
Heads up. Baron Krieger just arrived.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.824
Is this on?

17:22.826 --> 17:26.127
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.663
My name is Max Lorenz,

17:28.665 --> 17:31.132
and, uh, this little waltz

17:31.134 --> 17:32.634
I am about to sing for you

17:32.636 --> 17:34.502
is an original song.

17:34.504 --> 17:37.238
Uh, very popular in Austria

17:37.240 --> 17:39.641
where... where the hills are alive

17:39.643 --> 17:42.444
with the sound of music.

17:43.913 --> 17:45.079
Key of A.

17:45.081 --> 17:46.181
Watch me for the changes

17:46.183 --> 17:47.882
and try to keep up.

17:49.752 --> 17:52.921
One, two, three. One, two, three.

18:24.921 --> 18:28.490
The Askaran Amulet is
not degenerate artwork.

18:28.492 --> 18:30.391
It is a masterpiece.

18:30.393 --> 18:32.193
Which you will help my men transport

18:32.195 --> 18:35.630
to the exchange tomorrow at 01000.

18:35.632 --> 18:39.000

the Fuehrer's disapproval.

You did not salute the Fuehrer.

19:11.601 --> 19:13.101
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.

19:13.103 --> 19:15.203
I'm all about saluting the Fuehrer.

19:15.205 --> 19:16.538
You're lying.

19:16.540 --> 19:18.406
I was watching you the entire time.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.454
Uh, you know what? I... I just...

19:20.455 --> 19:21.276
I have a little crick in my neck,

19:21.278 --> 19:24.946
and it's really hard for
me to straighten my arm.

19:24.948 --> 19:27.949
Heil Hitler.

19:27.951 --> 19:29.817
Heil Hitler!

19:31.287 --> 19:33.087
H...

19:33.089 --> 19:34.422
h...

19:34.424 --> 19:36.324
Ha...

19:36.326 --> 19:38.059
Ha... aw, hell.

19:39.563 --> 19:41.362
Why do you get to punch him?

19:44.901 --> 19:46.134
Protect Max Lorenz!

20:10.327 --> 20:13.361
What the hell are you doing here?

20:13.363 --> 20:16.831
We came back to...

20:16.833 --> 20:18.099
to rescue you.

20:28.796 --> 20:31.319
If we're meant to be impressed
by all this technology,

20:31.895 --> 20:33.495
it has the opposite effect.

20:33.497 --> 20:35.397
It only makes you that
much more dangerous.

20:35.399 --> 20:37.298
Well, and there's evidence
to support that,

20:37.300 --> 20:38.733
but I think what's important now

20:38.735 --> 20:40.235
is for all us to stop arguing.

20:40.237 --> 20:41.836
Does your team ever stop arguing?

20:41.838 --> 20:43.171
Fair point.

20:43.173 --> 20:44.939
I think what Martin is trying to say

20:44.941 --> 20:47.008
is we're gonna help you
whether you like it or not.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.810
You're going after Krieger.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.478
We know where he's going next.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.314
And given the laws of
temporal mechanics,

20:53.316 --> 20:54.516
if you die,

20:54.518 --> 20:56.217
your grandson ceases to exist.

20:56.219 --> 20:57.819
Well, I don't pretend
to understand any of

20:57.821 --> 21:00.955
this time travel bunk,
but these fellas do have a timeship.

21:00.957 --> 21:02.424
Might come in handy.

21:02.426 --> 21:04.826
And having them as our
back-up might be the only way

21:04.828 --> 21:06.561
to keep them out of trouble.

21:06.563 --> 21:07.723
Let's put it to a vote, then.

21:10.701 --> 21:13.168
The ayes have it.

21:15.071 --> 21:17.739
Did your reconnaissance at the
club yield any usable intel?

21:17.741 --> 21:18.940
Only to map the area.

21:18.942 --> 21:20.508
Bringing one online now.

21:20.510 --> 21:21.943
- What was that?
- AI.

21:21.945 --> 21:23.645
A talking computer.

21:23.647 --> 21:24.979
What's a computer?

21:24.981 --> 21:26.581
There. The Fontainebleau Forest.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.050
Now, I saw a few of Krieger's
men studying a map of it.

21:29.052 --> 21:30.552
That must be where Krieger's planning on

21:30.554 --> 21:31.920
making the exchange.

21:31.922 --> 21:34.089
Nate overheard Krieger talking about

21:34.091 --> 21:35.356
making a trade for something

21:35.358 --> 21:36.991
called an Askaran Amulet.

21:36.993 --> 21:38.393
Hitler has long amassed

21:38.395 --> 21:40.061
ancient artifacts such as this one.

21:40.063 --> 21:41.663
He may want the amulet
because it conveys

21:41.665 --> 21:43.198
some sort of occult power.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.866
Our objective should
be to take out the Baron

21:44.868 --> 21:46.501
and stop this exchange at all costs.

21:46.503 --> 21:49.671
I propose we survey all
military activity in the area

21:49.673 --> 21:51.206
to learn what we're up against.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.373
We don't have time for that.

21:52.375 --> 21:53.408
I concur.

21:53.410 --> 21:54.646
We should have both teams gear up while

21:54.647 --> 21:56.277
Dr. Stein and I finalize the details.

21:56.279 --> 21:59.114
Be ready to go at first light.

22:03.252 --> 22:05.253
How are things with your grandfather?

22:05.255 --> 22:07.489
You know, I think he's
avoiding me for some reason.

22:07.491 --> 22:10.024
Well, it's hard for people
to look at their future.

22:10.026 --> 22:11.026
Maybe.

22:12.895 --> 22:16.431
Oh, one of the Nazis at
the club had a knife.

22:16.433 --> 22:19.134
Well, that should have
stopped bleeding by now.

22:19.136 --> 22:21.369
I'm just gonna get a new bandage.

22:21.371 --> 22:24.439
To go with your bruise?

22:24.441 --> 22:27.342
Well, you know how fragile
we historians can be.

22:27.344 --> 22:28.977
This isn't fragility.

22:28.979 --> 22:32.347
I know my cuts and bruises.

22:32.349 --> 22:34.249
You're a hemophiliac.

22:34.251 --> 22:36.351
Your blood doesn't clot,
wounds can't heal,

22:36.353 --> 22:38.419
and if it's bad, you can bleed to death.

22:38.421 --> 22:40.155
Yeah, well, you don't have
to worry about that.

22:40.157 --> 22:41.055
Too late.

22:41.057 --> 22:42.724
You could've died tonight.

22:42.726 --> 22:44.492
But I didn't. In fact,
it was the opposite.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.828
I never felt more alive.

22:46.830 --> 22:49.130
Look, when I was five years
old, I cut my knee,

22:49.132 --> 22:52.033
and my mother wouldn't let me
out of the house till I was 16.

22:52.035 --> 22:54.836
I'm a grown man.
I can make my own decisions.

22:54.838 --> 22:56.404
- Not on this ship, you can't.
- Sara...

22:56.406 --> 22:58.807
Look, I cannot let you
go out there tomorrow,

22:58.809 --> 23:00.608
knowing that you could get killed.

23:00.610 --> 23:03.511
I have enough deaths on
my conscience as it is.

23:03.513 --> 23:07.215
Look, I know you don't think
I can add anything to this team,

23:07.217 --> 23:09.684
but out there? Out there is history.

23:09.686 --> 23:12.453
And nobody knows more about it than me.

23:12.455 --> 23:17.659
Well, we've been managing
just fine without you.

23:17.661 --> 23:19.060
Mostly fine.

23:23.332 --> 23:25.967
Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.

23:25.969 --> 23:29.137
Oh, actually, I made it
to fit me perfectly.

23:29.139 --> 23:31.272
It's constructed out
of a proprietary alloy,

23:31.274 --> 23:34.108
and it's been battle-tested quite a bit.

23:34.110 --> 23:36.544
I even wore it in space once.

23:36.546 --> 23:37.912
Personal highlight.

23:37.914 --> 23:39.547
So your superpower is

23:39.549 --> 23:41.749
wearing the suit?

23:41.751 --> 23:43.284
Yeah, I guess so,

23:43.286 --> 23:47.188
it's a little more complicated
than that, but yeah.

23:47.190 --> 23:48.623
You're still mad at me for punching out

23:48.625 --> 23:50.158
that Nazi in the club, huh?

23:50.160 --> 23:53.027
I'm mad because you blew my cover.

23:53.029 --> 23:57.031
I'll never be able to go
undercover in Paris ever again.

23:57.033 --> 23:59.934
Yeah, sorry, I didn't think about that.

23:59.936 --> 24:02.637
I imagine that's a pattern
with you and your group.

24:02.639 --> 24:04.038
But I can't dwell on it.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.673
Getting stuck on past mistakes

24:05.675 --> 24:08.042
only takes focus off the
primary goal at hand.

24:08.044 --> 24:10.111
Well, I got to admit,
watching your team work

24:10.113 --> 24:12.413
like a well-oiled machine
kind of makes me feel

24:12.415 --> 24:14.849
like I'm doing this
whole hero thing wrong.

24:14.851 --> 24:17.385
If it's any consolation, Dr. Palmer,

24:17.387 --> 24:19.354
you're not really a hero.

24:20.489 --> 24:21.990
We better get ready.

24:31.601 --> 24:33.434
We've spotted the Baron's caravan.

24:33.436 --> 24:34.436
ETA five minutes.

25:08.137 --> 25:09.370
I've got eyes on the Baron.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.080
What the hell's going on down there?

25:19.082 --> 25:20.815
Animal Girl and I are
going after Krieger.

25:20.817 --> 25:23.051
In the field, I'm called Vixen.

25:23.053 --> 25:24.085
Negative, Raymond.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.287
Our target is the convoy.

25:26.289 --> 25:28.823
We've got the convoy
covered. Pursue the Baron.

25:32.429 --> 25:34.696
The mission is the amulet.

25:34.698 --> 25:35.863
Our mission is Krieger.

25:35.865 --> 25:37.198
We don't have time for this.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.833
Give me a moment. I... I...

25:38.835 --> 25:40.001
need to assess the situation.

25:40.003 --> 25:42.136
Krieger's getting away, man.

26:01.758 --> 26:03.024
What the hell was that?

26:05.662 --> 26:08.429
We're under attack.

26:08.431 --> 26:09.998
It's Krieger! He turned into a...

26:10.000 --> 26:11.499
We need backup!

26:12.736 --> 26:15.603
Dr. Palmer? Vixen? Do you read?

26:15.605 --> 26:17.138
Their comms are down.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.606
Oh, my God.

26:33.323 --> 26:34.522
I've got the amulet.

26:34.524 --> 26:35.556
Good work.

26:35.558 --> 26:37.058
Dr. Mid-Nite, Stargirl,

26:37.060 --> 26:39.260
Vixen and Dr. Palmer need assistance.

26:39.262 --> 26:40.328
Copy that.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.030
But I think we have a new problem.

26:52.141 --> 26:53.841
Grey, you got to get 'em out of there!

26:53.843 --> 26:55.143
I just need a minute.

27:00.617 --> 27:02.650
Come on, Grey! Do something!

27:02.652 --> 27:04.352
Uh...

27:04.354 --> 27:06.287
Fall back. Get Obsidian.

27:06.289 --> 27:08.589
Mick, lay down fire to cover our retreat.

27:08.591 --> 27:12.326
Now you're talking.

27:14.731 --> 27:16.531
Mick! Come on!

27:16.533 --> 27:19.133
Uh... Commander Steel, do...
do you still have the amulet?

27:19.135 --> 27:21.069
Yes, sir! En route to your position.

27:21.071 --> 27:22.570
What about Ray and Amaya?

27:22.572 --> 27:23.704
You just can't leave 'em there.

27:23.706 --> 27:25.073
Nor can we engage this super-Nazi.

27:25.075 --> 27:27.008
Not without compiling
more information first.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.743
This is not a science debate, Grey!

27:28.745 --> 27:31.079
Damn it! Jefferson, I know that!

27:31.081 --> 27:33.581
But for now, they're on their own.

27:44.678 --> 27:49.080
I must admit, it's a feat of engineering.

27:49.082 --> 27:51.215
Far beyond anything I have ever seen

27:51.217 --> 27:55.119
or expected from you Americans.

27:55.121 --> 27:56.554
Well, maybe you Germans

27:56.556 --> 27:58.423
should just stick to your luxury cars.

27:58.425 --> 28:01.059
Why should I fear a robot suit

28:01.061 --> 28:03.294
when I have become der Ubermensch?

28:03.296 --> 28:05.129
You really think a single case

28:05.131 --> 28:07.765
of 'roid rage is gonna win you the war?

28:07.767 --> 28:09.767
Yeah.

28:09.769 --> 28:11.903
Once I have replicated the super-serum

28:11.905 --> 28:14.105
for the entire Wehrmacht.

28:14.107 --> 28:16.140
But you haven't replicated the...

28:16.142 --> 28:18.209
what'd you call it? Super-serum?

28:18.211 --> 28:19.711
Kind of on the nose, don't you think?

28:19.713 --> 28:22.180
If all this is just a
preamble to you killing us,

28:22.182 --> 28:23.581
get it over with.

28:25.251 --> 28:29.120
I was hoping to torture
you a little bit first,

28:29.122 --> 28:30.855
but since you're in such a rush,

28:30.857 --> 28:32.223
I will be glad to accommodate you

28:32.225 --> 28:33.524
with your schedule.

28:33.526 --> 28:34.692
Wait, wait.

28:34.694 --> 28:35.893
I'm a scientist.

28:35.895 --> 28:38.229
That exo-suit? I invented it.

28:38.231 --> 28:40.965
I can help you with your little
supply and demand problem.

28:40.967 --> 28:42.500
I'll even improve it.

28:42.502 --> 28:44.836
Just don't shoot her.

28:47.440 --> 28:51.709
I hope you are as
smart as you say you are,

28:51.711 --> 28:53.911
for her sake.

29:00.887 --> 29:02.286
You know he's gonna kill us both

29:02.288 --> 29:05.289
even if you help him.

29:05.291 --> 29:06.691
I have a plan.

29:06.693 --> 29:09.427
That's what I'm afraid of.

29:09.429 --> 29:11.729
We have the amulet. Now what?

29:11.731 --> 29:14.432
First priority is making
sure Ray and Amaya are alive,

29:14.434 --> 29:16.100
and then getting them out of the bunker

29:16.102 --> 29:17.568
where the Nazis are holding them.

29:17.570 --> 29:19.370
Actually, our first priority
is destroying the Baron

29:19.372 --> 29:21.806
and whatever serum is
making him indestructible.

29:21.808 --> 29:23.341
Perhaps we could propose a trade.

29:23.343 --> 29:25.143
Their lives for the Amulet.

29:25.145 --> 29:26.778
Unfortunately, the amulet's
not ours to barter with.

29:26.780 --> 29:28.546
We need an extraction plan.

29:28.548 --> 29:30.415
We need to eliminate the threat.

29:30.417 --> 29:32.183
Now, Professor Stein, please, tell us,

29:32.185 --> 29:34.352
what is your plan of action?

29:34.354 --> 29:36.187
How... how am I supposed
to come up with a plan

29:36.189 --> 29:40.191
when I can't even hear myself think?

29:40.193 --> 29:42.060
Would... would you please all just leave?

29:42.062 --> 29:45.196
I... I need a moment
to collect my thoughts.

29:52.971 --> 29:54.439
What the hell, Grey?

29:54.441 --> 29:56.841
I can practically feel you
going crazy inside my head.

29:56.843 --> 29:58.142
I'm fine,

29:58.144 --> 29:59.744
Jefferson, I'm trying to determine

29:59.746 --> 30:00.978
the best course of action.

30:00.980 --> 30:02.213
I wouldn't believe that even if

30:02.215 --> 30:03.781
we didn't have a psychic connection,

30:03.783 --> 30:06.217
which... hold on... we do.

30:06.219 --> 30:09.854
I just don't know how Rip
was able to do all this.

30:09.856 --> 30:12.723
So many decisions to make,
consequences to manage,

30:12.725 --> 30:14.199
opinions to consider.

30:14.388 --> 30:16.455
Trying to reach a
consensus with this team

30:16.457 --> 30:18.631
is like something akin to chaos theory.

30:18.632 --> 30:19.619
That's the thing, Grey.

30:19.621 --> 30:21.587
We don't need someone
to reach a consensus.

30:21.589 --> 30:23.656
We just need someone
who can call the shots.

30:23.658 --> 30:25.625
Then you should have put a tactician,

30:25.627 --> 30:27.927
not a theoretician, in charge.

30:27.929 --> 30:30.196
You were right, Jefferson.

30:30.198 --> 30:33.432
I'm not a wartime consigliere.

30:39.940 --> 30:42.875
Are they gonna be okay?

30:42.877 --> 30:44.844
They'll live to fight another day.

30:44.846 --> 30:47.246
It's what we do.

30:47.248 --> 30:49.215
I used to fantasize about meeting you.

30:50.785 --> 30:53.886
Trading stories or having a beer.

30:55.123 --> 30:58.291
Or just making eye contact.

30:58.293 --> 31:01.627
I'm sorry, I, uh,

31:01.629 --> 31:05.498
I guess back at, uh, headquarters,

31:05.500 --> 31:07.667
I was afraid to get too close to you.

31:07.669 --> 31:09.702
Why? You're my grandfather.

31:09.704 --> 31:12.038
You're... you're more than that.
You're a hero to me.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.473
I don't want to be anyone's hero.

31:14.475 --> 31:16.776
That look you gave me
when we first met,

31:16.778 --> 31:18.978
I've seen it before,

31:18.980 --> 31:21.547
when people look up to me,

31:21.549 --> 31:23.382
decide that they have
to act a certain way,

31:23.384 --> 31:26.085
a way that's likely to get them killed.

31:29.157 --> 31:31.057
I do what I do

31:31.059 --> 31:33.192
so that others don't have to.

31:33.194 --> 31:34.627
So you wouldn't have to.

31:34.629 --> 31:36.362
My whole life, people
have been trying to

31:36.364 --> 31:41.100
shield me from the
world, your son included.

31:41.102 --> 31:46.138
Meanwhile, all I ever wanted
to be was a soldier, like you.

31:46.140 --> 31:48.140
It's a parent's job

31:48.142 --> 31:50.142
to protect their child,

31:50.144 --> 31:52.011
but it's a child's obligation
to themselves

31:52.013 --> 31:54.213
to live their own life.

31:54.215 --> 31:56.315
You can and should

31:56.317 --> 31:59.318
do whatever you set your mind to.

32:03.124 --> 32:05.291
But you should know,

32:05.293 --> 32:06.892
you don't have to be a soldier

32:06.894 --> 32:09.528
to be a hero.

32:13.401 --> 32:15.468
And we approach from the southwest,

32:15.470 --> 32:17.703
destroy the weapons lab
and the Baron in one move.

32:17.705 --> 32:19.238
Except for the last time we faced him,

32:19.240 --> 32:20.539
he took out both of our teams.

32:20.541 --> 32:21.874
The last time, we weren't being backed

32:21.876 --> 32:23.442
by a squadron of B-17s.

32:23.444 --> 32:25.044
Then how do we get Ray and Amaya out

32:25.046 --> 32:26.646
before the bombs start falling?

32:26.648 --> 32:27.880
We don't.

32:29.317 --> 32:31.517
This conflict is bigger
than any one of us.

32:31.519 --> 32:33.452
If it means ending the
war one day sooner,

32:33.454 --> 32:35.855
Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.

32:35.857 --> 32:37.590
But she doesn't have to.

32:37.592 --> 32:39.725
Look, I know you and your team think

32:39.727 --> 32:41.894
we're a group of irresponsible losers,

32:41.896 --> 32:43.195
but I know Ray Palmer,

32:43.197 --> 32:45.431
and he has a plan to
get out of that bunker.

32:45.433 --> 32:47.102
We just need to give him time...

32:47.103 --> 32:49.201
Which means giving the Nazis time.

32:49.203 --> 32:51.070
I'm calling in the strike.

32:51.072 --> 32:52.305
I can't let you do that.

32:52.307 --> 32:53.906
You don't have the authority.

32:53.908 --> 32:57.376
Yes, she does.

32:57.378 --> 32:59.312
Miss Lance speaks for all of us.

32:59.314 --> 33:01.314
I have watched her
become the beating heart

33:01.316 --> 33:04.083
and steady hand of this team.

33:04.085 --> 33:07.186
She is the proper person to lead us.

33:07.188 --> 33:08.287
And if she says that we are

33:08.289 --> 33:11.057
going to rescue our people,

33:11.059 --> 33:13.426
that is what we are going to do.

33:23.422 --> 33:26.356
This would go a lot faster
if I wasn't handcuffed.

33:26.358 --> 33:27.824
I mean, what do you
think, I'm gonna escape

33:27.826 --> 33:30.460
using a microscope?

33:30.462 --> 33:34.064
Are you going to make more serum,

33:34.066 --> 33:36.433
or is your friend going to die?

33:36.435 --> 33:38.535
First off, it's not a serum.

33:38.537 --> 33:40.570
It's a biomolecular enhancer.

33:40.572 --> 33:41.738
By the way, who gave you this?

33:41.740 --> 33:43.840
Because from an engineering standpoint,

33:43.842 --> 33:45.242
it's really rather ama...

33:45.244 --> 33:47.844
Yes. I can make more.

33:47.846 --> 33:51.014
Ray, don't do it.

33:51.016 --> 33:52.115
Don't help him.

33:58.756 --> 34:00.757
Back to work.

34:07.098 --> 34:11.001
Watch them.

34:11.003 --> 34:12.668
How can you do this?

34:12.670 --> 34:16.306
No member of the JSA
would ever help the Nazis.

34:16.308 --> 34:18.842
Neither would a Legend.

34:24.116 --> 34:26.949
Damn, I really wanted to do
it with just the microscope.

34:26.952 --> 34:28.185
Get the handcuff keys.

34:30.822 --> 34:33.389
Alpha-stabilizer's damaged.

34:33.391 --> 34:34.958
Suit's not gonna work.

34:37.062 --> 34:38.495
They took my amulet.

34:38.496 --> 34:40.263
And without it,
I'm guessing you're just...

34:40.264 --> 34:41.464
A 5th-degree black belt,

34:41.466 --> 34:43.199
with training in edged weapons combat.

34:43.202 --> 34:44.900
Nice, but

34:44.902 --> 34:47.404
I think we'll need more than
that to get past super-Krieger.

34:47.406 --> 34:48.572
What are you doing?

34:48.574 --> 34:50.239
I told you I had a plan.

34:50.242 --> 34:52.509
It was to get my hands on this

34:52.511 --> 34:55.178
and enhance it, but not for them.

34:55.179 --> 34:57.414
I'm not only a man in a metal suit.

34:57.416 --> 34:59.416
At least not after this.

35:02.554 --> 35:04.321
We are under attack.

35:04.323 --> 35:06.256
Baron Krieger has ordered
us to transport you

35:06.258 --> 35:07.924
to a more secure location.

35:07.926 --> 35:09.392
Who's attacking you?

35:09.394 --> 35:11.561
Sir, the sentries are reporting

35:11.563 --> 35:13.663
a man made of fire flying
through the forest.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.633
Lock down the base.

35:16.635 --> 35:17.734
Now.

35:41.692 --> 35:44.194
Firestorm is drawing the
troops away from the bunker.

35:44.196 --> 35:45.462
Copy that.

35:45.464 --> 35:48.098
We still need to find Ray and Amaya.

35:50.836 --> 35:52.102
Mick, look out!

35:55.941 --> 35:57.474
Thanks, Haircut.

35:57.476 --> 36:00.277
I believe this belongs to you.

36:02.514 --> 36:05.248
Steel, Mid-Nite, we've
recovered the rest of the team.

36:07.085 --> 36:09.786
I suggest you save the
teary reunion for later.

36:09.788 --> 36:12.155
Hourman ordered the bombers to strike.

36:12.157 --> 36:13.890
They're five minutes out.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.396
But Herr Krieger is here right now!

36:29.340 --> 36:32.242
Come on, you Nazi bastard.

36:50.361 --> 36:52.362
- Get on!
- What are you doing here?

36:52.364 --> 36:54.497
Saving you! Get on!

37:09.413 --> 37:10.980
Bombing run about to commence.

37:10.982 --> 37:12.382
All points, get clear.

37:12.384 --> 37:13.950
Working on it!

37:28.933 --> 37:30.300
What was that?

37:30.302 --> 37:31.668
He's dead.

37:32.571 --> 37:34.371
You did it. You saved us!

37:52.706 --> 37:55.301
I'm afraid Mr. Heywood's
vitals are dropping.

37:55.390 --> 37:57.486
There's got to be something on board
this tub to get him back on his feet.

37:57.487 --> 37:59.093
You people are from the future,
for God's sake!

37:59.094 --> 38:01.521
The bomb blast caused
massive internal bleeding,

38:01.522 --> 38:03.863
and because his body lacks
the normal clotting factor,

38:03.865 --> 38:05.598
there's only so much Gideon can do!

38:08.470 --> 38:10.269
Were you two close?

38:10.271 --> 38:12.105
No, not really,

38:12.107 --> 38:13.639
but if it wasn't for Nate,
I'd still be trapped

38:13.641 --> 38:14.907
in the Cretaceous period,

38:14.909 --> 38:18.277
being chased by a T. rex.

38:18.279 --> 38:19.812
I'm sorry.

38:19.814 --> 38:22.315
This is our fight, not yours.

38:22.317 --> 38:24.450
- The Nazis are not...
- Nazis.

38:24.452 --> 38:26.686
Nazis.

38:26.688 --> 38:27.854
You kept the serum?

38:27.856 --> 38:29.355
There may be enough.

38:31.659 --> 38:33.793
I think I can save him, with this.

38:33.795 --> 38:35.595
Is that the Nazi serum that created

38:35.597 --> 38:37.864
that hideous berserker? Are you mad?

38:37.866 --> 38:39.732
I did a little tinkering
tothe formula, so...

38:39.734 --> 38:41.267
So what will it do now?

38:41.269 --> 38:43.336
With any luck, save his life.

38:43.338 --> 38:45.204
How do we know if it's working?

38:45.206 --> 38:47.273
He's not dead yet, so that's a good sign.

38:47.275 --> 38:49.775
And he's not turning
into a Nazi berserker.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.411
His vitals are improving.

38:53.515 --> 38:56.249
He's stabilizing.

39:00.121 --> 39:03.923
What'd the Nazis want with
a piece of jewelry anyway?

39:03.925 --> 39:05.224
No idea.

39:05.226 --> 39:08.394
Hitler's known to be
obsessed with the strange.

39:08.396 --> 39:10.062
We'll keep it safe, in any case.

39:10.064 --> 39:12.865
I guess that's your
way of saying thanks.

39:12.867 --> 39:15.067
Right, well, I think it's time

39:15.069 --> 39:17.170
we got out of 1942.

39:17.172 --> 39:18.504
This was fun.

39:18.506 --> 39:22.041
It was unusual.

39:22.043 --> 39:23.476
Hey,

39:23.478 --> 39:24.744
I wanted to

39:24.746 --> 39:27.680
apologize for what I said.

39:27.682 --> 39:29.682
About me not being a hero?

39:29.684 --> 39:31.651
You're not a superhero,

39:31.653 --> 39:34.253
but what you did for Nate,

39:34.255 --> 39:35.421
giving him the serum,

39:35.423 --> 39:38.357
giving up your chance at real powers,

39:38.359 --> 39:39.759
that was heroic.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.903
Oh, it's about time, Sleeping Beauty.

39:50.905 --> 39:52.672
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up in time

39:52.674 --> 39:53.940
for me to say good-bye.

39:53.942 --> 39:57.043
And here I was afraid

39:57.045 --> 40:00.246
I wasn't gonna wake up at all.

40:00.248 --> 40:01.747
I was afraid of that too.

40:04.585 --> 40:06.552
I'm sorry if I didn't

40:06.554 --> 40:09.121
live up to the version
of Commander Steel

40:09.123 --> 40:12.124
you dreamt of meeting.

40:12.126 --> 40:14.627
Nah, I like the real version better.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.198
Well, I'll be damned.

40:24.172 --> 40:27.473
Guess this means we're
both gonna make it.

40:27.475 --> 40:30.243
Not bad for a historian.

40:30.245 --> 40:32.178
Not bad for a hero.

40:48.529 --> 40:49.762
Hello, Rex.

40:49.764 --> 40:50.730
Who are you?

40:50.732 --> 40:52.031
Oh, we've met before.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.833
Quite a number of times, actually.

40:53.835 --> 40:56.369
In fact, after our last go,
you discovered my plan

40:56.371 --> 40:58.170
and then traveled through time yourself

40:58.172 --> 41:00.072
to stop the Legends from coming here.

41:00.074 --> 41:02.441
They... they said I disappeared.

41:02.443 --> 41:03.943
Not disappeared.

41:03.945 --> 41:04.777
No.

41:04.779 --> 41:06.779
Erased from the timeline.

41:08.283 --> 41:09.482
Like this.

41:09.484 --> 41:11.083
No.

41:19.594 --> 41:20.594
Rex?

41:21.596 --> 41:23.253
Rex?

41:24.399 --> 41:25.598
Rex.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.334
Rex, no.

41:28.336 --> 41:31.003
Time...

41:31.005 --> 41:33.239
time traveler.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.508
No.

41:35.510 --> 41:36.876
Rex.
