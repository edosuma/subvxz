I tell 'em to fuck off.</i>

01:06.691 --> 01:08.860

I hadn't met the right woman yet.</i>

01:15.658 --> 01:17.911
<i>According to her,
the reason I got such a late start</i>

01:17.911 --> 01:20.038
<i>is because I had an unhappy childhood.</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:23.208
<i>But I'm not gonna whine about it.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:24.626

- Oh, you motherfucking--
- You're up.

Hey! Give me the stick!
Give me the stick! Give me the stick!

02:05.917 --> 02:08.086
Hey, buddy. What happened? You all right?

02:08.086 --> 02:10.255
Colin pushed me.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.756
Yeah, I know he did.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.384
I told you if you play rough,
rough things are gonna happen, right?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.719
- Here, let me see.
- [man 2] Colin, give me the stick!

02:16.719 --> 02:19.514
Ah, that's not so bad.
Just rub some dirt on it, buddy.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.475
There you go.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.062
You might wanna get him checked
or at least put a little Neosporin on it.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.438
That thing could get infected.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.568
- Who are you?
- I'm, uh, Hunter Lewis.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.486
Lisa's husband.
Just moved in across the street.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.487
Thanks for having me.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.198
Oh, yeah? Are you a doctor,
or are you just one of those WebMD guys?

02:37.198 --> 02:39.450
It's just common knowledge.
You wanna keep the cut clean.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.620
Oh, is it? Listen, I'm trying to raise
a little man here, not a fucking pussy.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.955
So I appreciate your concern.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.166
But why don't you just go back
to your hard seltzer

02:46.166 --> 02:49.252
and, you know, go on Twitter and go share
the story where you're the hero?

02:51.212 --> 02:52.172
[Hunter] Okay.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.674
Daddy, you said a bad word.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.510
Yeah, I know I did, buddy.
Sometimes you have to, all right?

02:57.510 --> 03:00.972
Don't tell your mother. She'll kill me.
I love you. Come on. Let's get up.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.891
[man 2] Hang on, Jack! Hang on! Hang on!

03:02.891 --> 03:04.184
[panting]

03:04.184 --> 03:06.311
Colin's got something
he wants to say to you, kid.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.729
But, Dad, he pushed me first--

03:07.729 --> 03:09.898
Hey, no, no, no. I don't care. Okay?

03:09.898 --> 03:12.483
You don't hit somebody with a stick.
We don't hit our friends.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.361
Let's apologize now.
Say you're sorry to Nate. Come on.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.404
[screaming] No!

03:16.404 --> 03:18.698
- [man 2] Hey, come on. Don't cry.
- [screaming continues]

03:18.698 --> 03:20.658
Come on. It's okay, buddy.
Say you're sorry.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.369
I'm just asking you to apologize.
You don't gotta freak out.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.580
- Hey, buddy. Ah, shit.
- [screaming] No!

03:25.580 --> 03:28.208
Okay, okay. What is going on?
Why is he screaming?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.710
Because he hit Nate with a stick,
and I told him to apologize.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.753
[fingers snap]

03:35.673 --> 03:39.594
What you're feeling now
is what you're feeling, okay?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.014
Let it out.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.975
[Colin screaming]

03:45.975 --> 03:48.978
- I don't think that--
- [woman 1] I don't need you to think now.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.314
You need to respect your son's autonomy

03:51.314 --> 03:53.650
and really let him process
how crossing this boundary

03:53.650 --> 03:56.152
is affecting his ever-evolving moral code.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.363
I want my stick!

03:58.363 --> 04:00.365
[fingers snap] Stick, where is it?

04:00.949 --> 04:01.866
It's...

04:03.660 --> 04:06.246
Jack. How's Nate doing in school?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.791
Great, you know. He's comin' along.
Uh, how's your little one doing?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.168
He's great. He's perfect.

04:15.004 --> 04:15.880
Yeah?

04:19.550 --> 04:20.843
Come on, bro. I...

04:22.553 --> 04:23.846
- [Colin] No!
- Hey, hey, hey!

04:23.846 --> 04:24.806
Jesus!

04:24.806 --> 04:27.475
I'm gonna murder you. I swear to God.
Let's go get a drink. Come on.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.104
- How fucking sad is that?
- He did it to himself.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.188
[Jack] Yes, he did.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.982
- [Colin] No!
- [Connor] Come on, stop it.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.360
Did you see that? That kid is a maniac.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.569
Yeah, he's a lunatic.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.613
I'm gonna say something to Cara.
It's too much.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.198
No, no, no. Don't say anything.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.659
I'm not gonna freak out on her.
I'm just gonna talk to her.

04:44.659 --> 04:48.496
- Like, mom to mom. It's what moms do.
- Mike, should she say something?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.748
Three cardinal rules of friendship.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.042
Don't bring up politics.
Don't bring up religion.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.837
And don't try to tell people
how to raise their kids.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.966
Oh, I'm sorry, Mike. I didn't realize
you had your own daytime talk show.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.177

05:03.678 --> 05:06.139
Girlfriend, ex-wife.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.852
- It's kinda airtight, honey.
- Mmm, kind of. Not really.

05:12.020 --> 05:12.854
[chuckles]

05:12.854 --> 05:14.147
What'd she mean by that?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.482
Uh, she's just breaking your balls.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.318
Look, we're happy for you guys.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.279
We're wondering when you're gonna make
an honest woman out of Britney.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.824
I told you. She doesn't wanna get married.
She doesn't wanna have kids.

05:25.408 --> 05:29.037
All she wants to do
is fuck me and go to the gym.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.248
Goddamn, Mike.
You found a fucking unicorn.

It's a team sport.

We're about to become

Jack, selling a business
and the owner staying on

06:39.399 --> 06:42.735
is older than discovering
a country that already has people.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.694
There you go.

06:43.694 --> 06:47.240
Not to mention, the time to complain
was before we signed the deal.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.034
- I did complain about it.
- Yeah, but you complain about everything.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.369
[Jack] Oh, I do not.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.831
Relax. It's gonna be great.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.583
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You're home free.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.585
Yeah, that's true.
You got no more child support.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.379
- You got college taken care of.
- Yeah.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.340
What are gonna do now?
Airbnb your kids' rooms, you cheap prick?

- [sarcastic laughter]

07:05.800 --> 07:08.803
Laugh now, motherfuckers, but wait
till you see what I got coming next.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.430
Yeah, we'll see. We'll see.

- [woman] Morning, guys.

[woman 2] Morning.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.271
Monica, what's poppin', girl?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.313
Good morning, Connor.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.109
Yo, you happen to check
that new joint from Lil Baby

07:23.109 --> 07:24.444
dropped on Twitter last night?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.529
- [Monica] No.
- What? Boom. Come on. Pound it out.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.114
Ah, it's okay. Thanks.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.160
- Oh God.
- [Mike] There he goes again.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.620
Don't sleep on Lil Baby,
on any of the babies.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.331
I heard Big Baby got something
coming out too. It's gonna be fire.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.249
Big Baby?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.543
[Connor] Yeah, you... you peep him yet?

07:41.169 --> 07:42.503
I don't believe I have, no.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.088
What? He's fleek.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.842
- Oh.
- Yeah, he's on fleek. Flickity-fleek.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.469
- [chuckles]
- [Mike] Connor, come on.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.263
- Aight. Gotta bounce.
- [Monica] Okay.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.056
- One love. One love, girl.
- Okay. Okay.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.349
[Connor] One love, y'all.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.313
You know,
she's never gonna think you're cool.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.024
I am cool, Jack. I'm sorry
that you feel threatened by that.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.692
Oh, I think everybody's threatened by it.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.778
All right, you two, lock it down.
We gotta impress this dude.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.281
Wait. By "this dude,"

08:10.281 --> 08:12.950
you mean the douchebag
half our age we now work for?

08:13.868 --> 08:16.037
I don't know, Jack.
If I were you, I'd give him a chance.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.290
I hear Aspen has
a real collaborative leadership style.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.125
That guy?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.629
He looks like
he's in a musical about janitors.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.131
[Mike] Play nice, Jack.
The new owners love him.

08:27.131 --> 08:30.176
And if we wanna get paid,
we gotta keep our jobs.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.970
Gentlemen. What an honor.

08:32.970 --> 08:33.930
Aspen Bell.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.348
- Mike.
- Uh-huh.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.184
- Hey! Connor.
- Oh! I'm gonna get some of that? Ah!

08:38.184 --> 08:40.478
- Jack. Good.
- Hey, how are you? That's all right.

08:40.478 --> 08:44.023
Okay. Uh, guys.
Yeah, have a seat. Get comfortable.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.903
Wow! The trifecta behind Trifecta.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.739
This is some broad shoulders
to stand on, boys.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.157
Let's get right to it.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.827
Look, this is your company, right?

08:56.827 --> 08:57.828
You built it.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.916
And I want you to know that I respect
the shit out of what you've done here.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.293
I mean, come on, throwback jerseys?

09:04.293 --> 09:08.089
You didn't just start the trend.
You perfected it.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.132
The breathability of this fabric.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.593
Must have been sewn by the gods.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.888
Actually, it was sewn together
by some hardworking women in Koreatown.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.931
[Mike clears throat]

09:17.765 --> 09:20.059
But, uh, thank you.
We're, uh, very proud of it.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.018
And you should be.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.896
You should be very proud
of everything that you've done here.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.401
And I want you to know
that my door will always be open to you.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.280
But I'm gonna break some eggs
because I'm a disruptor.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.447
It's in my DNA.

09:34.949 --> 09:35.950
What does that mean?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.827
It means that we're gonna pivot.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.747
This company is now a gender-neutral,
carbon-neutral,

09:41.747 --> 09:44.041
21st-century lifestyle apparel brand.

09:44.041 --> 09:49.046
And the first step in that is
to liberate everyone born before 1988.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.674
[woman] For what? All of us?

09:53.092 --> 09:56.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck?
That's, like, half the company.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.056
- [Mike] Calm down, man.
- [Jack] You calm down.

09:59.056 --> 10:02.018
- [man] Let's go.
- Damien's 35? Goddamn, he looks good.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.938
Hey, what happened to two weeks' notice?
You can't just kick 'em out.

10:05.938 --> 10:06.897
Don't touch me.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.317
These people put their hearts and souls
into this business.

10:09.317 --> 10:13.863
And we signed them up for Zip Recruiter.
They're gonna have a new job in no time.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.450
Look, we are living in an exponential era.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.367
Hmm.

10:18.367 --> 10:22.288
Jack, change and growth,
these things happen faster than they did

10:22.288 --> 10:23.831
when you were young.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.291
I mean, look at me.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.210
I'm 28 years old, and I've already worked
for 15 different start-ups.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.423
- Is that something you wanna brag about?
- [Aspen] Absolutely.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.635
Success does not care
about the way that you feel.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.763
I want people to come in here
with a smile on their face,

10:38.763 --> 10:41.849
but I need them
to have Kevlar in their souls.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.268
If that's too much to ask,

10:44.268 --> 10:46.520
then I don't care
how long you've been here.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.856
You're gonna be out the door.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.484
Is that a threat?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.903
No, no. It's just transparent leadership.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.322
Look, I care about you.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.784
In fact, there is this woman
I would love for you to go see.

10:59.784 --> 11:03.329
She's an old friend of my mom.
She has had a lot of success

11:03.913 --> 11:10.169
helping people in your situation
to restrain their aggressive tendencies.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.798
You want me to go see a shrink?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.466
I appreciate you.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.180
"I appreciate you." "I appreciate you."

11:21.764 --> 11:24.225
Fucking sociopath hipster douche.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.185
Gonna threaten me
in my own goddamn building?

11:26.185 --> 11:28.729
I'll fucking knock you out,
throw you in a bag of laundry,

11:28.729 --> 11:30.815
and they'll never fucking see you again.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.776
- Oh my God!
- [car horn honks]

11:33.776 --> 11:35.444
Come on! I'm gonna be late.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.114
Just fucking sitting there.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.993
Oh, look at this fucking asshole.

11:43.577 --> 11:47.540
Fucking 30-year-old man riding a kids' toy
right in the middle of the fucking street!

11:47.540 --> 11:49.291
- [car horn honks]
- Get over!

11:50.000 --> 11:53.963
What's he doing now? Is he freestyling?
Is he making a YouTube video?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.800
Oh my God!
How fucking self-involved are you?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.260
[car horn honking]

11:59.260 --> 12:00.344
Share the road!

12:00.344 --> 12:01.554
Hey, I agree!

12:01.554 --> 12:04.765
So, why don't you get up onto
the fucking sidewalk where you belong?

12:06.016 --> 12:09.437
Oh, is that for me?
Oh, you a tough guy now, huh? Huh?

12:09.437 --> 12:10.855
- [tires squeal]
- [car horn honks]

12:10.855 --> 12:13.733
Where you going,
you little cocksucker, huh?

12:18.028 --> 12:18.904
What?

12:20.072 --> 12:23.200
When was the last time you saw
one of those bastards stop at a stop sign?

12:23.200 --> 12:27.037
Then they get hit and frost the thing
like some unforeseen tragedy happened.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.123
Am I wrong?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.000
Yes.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.711
Toxic.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.219
[Jack] Oh, look at this. Of course.

12:42.887 --> 12:43.721
Unbelievable.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.432
500 people come here every day,
and they got 20 fucking spots.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.768
How much money do you have to pay
to get a parking lot?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.604
What does that say?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.981
I'm not reading all that fucking shit.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.026
Eh, fuck it. Be in and out.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.116
So, you are reading
to your kids every night?

13:04.116 --> 13:05.451
[woman] Uh, we do 17--

13:05.451 --> 13:07.369
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, sir?

13:07.369 --> 13:08.287
Yeah?

13:08.287 --> 13:11.665
- You were late for pickup.
- I'm sorry. There was no parking spots.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.587
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Nate! Hey, little buddy.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.798
Ah! What's up?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.758
What's up?

13:20.758 --> 13:22.968
- I've missed you, man.
- Me too.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.762
- How was school?
- [Nate] Good.

13:25.262 --> 13:29.058
- You were late for pickup.
- Yeah, I told you I couldn't find a spot.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.685
I'm sorry. We don't accept excuses.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.855
Wasn't an excuse. Just what happened.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.316
Plus, I was only, like,
two minutes late, right, buddy?

13:37.316 --> 13:39.777
- Have you read the school guidebook?
- Yep.

13:45.866 --> 13:46.700
What?

13:47.201 --> 13:49.328
It's a dollar
for every minute you're late.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.955
Of course it is.

13:52.081 --> 13:52.998
Okay.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.796
- Here's five bucks. It's all I got.
- Oh, no. The first violation is free.

13:59.797 --> 14:03.342
Really? Well, why didn't you tell me that
before I put my kid down?

14:03.342 --> 14:07.346
Well, if you'd actually read the guidebook
instead of just saying you did,

14:07.346 --> 14:09.139
I wouldn't have to tell you anything.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.143
- Is there, like, a problem here, miss?
- Well, actually--

14:13.143 --> 14:14.562
If you have some issue with me,

14:14.562 --> 14:17.022
you take me aside in private,
and you talk to me.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.108
You don't dress me down
in front of my kid.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.318
I'm paying you to educate my son,
not me, okay?

14:21.318 --> 14:24.321
Oh. Well, we here
at Little Hearts and Minds

14:24.321 --> 14:27.241
believe that education
extends into the home.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.826
Oh, do you? Fantastic.

14:28.826 --> 14:32.162
And once again, you'd know that
if you'd picked up the guidebook and--

14:32.162 --> 14:34.874
Jesus Christ!
I read the goddamn fucking guidebook!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.709
All right, you stumpy little cunt?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.461
Wow!

14:41.213 --> 14:42.381
Oh my God.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.553
Let's go, Nate.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.431
[Nate] Daddy, what's a cunt?

14:50.431 --> 14:53.517
[Jack] Somebody that gives you shit
for being two seconds late for pickup.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.435
How you doing?

14:56.186 --> 14:58.731
Okay, buddy, we're home.
Now what are we gonna do?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.609
[Nate] Forget what happened
and finish my ice cream.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.902
[Jack] That's right.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.448
Hey, buddy, was that good?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.659
Ah, you're the best. Here.
Let's get you cleaned up real quick.

15:10.659 --> 15:13.621
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
Doop-doop-doop-doop-doop.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.914
Yep, okay, cool.

15:15.789 --> 15:19.084
All right. Nothing but happiness
when we go in there, okay? Awesome.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.294
Mommy!

15:20.794 --> 15:23.380
Well, hey! How are you, buddy?

15:23.380 --> 15:26.425
- Hey, how was your meeting, honey?
- Oh, it was good! How was pickup?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.552
[Jack] Oh, it was great,
smooth, uneventful.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.055
Hey, you wanna go watch <i>Puppy Dog Pals</i>?

15:31.055 --> 15:33.891
<i>- Puppy Dog Pals!</i>
- <i>Puppy Dog Pals.</i> Yay!

15:33.891 --> 15:35.309
[Leah clears throat] Jack.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.189
Uneventful? I just got off the phone
with Doctor Lois Shmieckel-Turner.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.774
Oh boy.

15:41.774 --> 15:46.195
What is uneventful about calling
Nate's principal a stumpy "C"?

15:46.195 --> 15:49.782
If you saw the way she was talking to me,
it was a perfectly normal response.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.201
- For who?
- Anyone with a shred of dignity.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.577
[whispers] Keep it down.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.954
[TV playing]

15:55.537 --> 15:57.247
[whispers] Anyone with a shred of dignity.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.708
Okay, she was talking to me
like some deadbeat dad

15:59.708 --> 16:02.002
for showing up
a minute and a half late for pickup.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.922
Oh my God!
This has nothing to do with your dignity.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.133
This has everything
to do with our son's academic future.

16:08.133 --> 16:12.179
Do you know how powerful
Doctor Lois Shmieckel-Turner is?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.640
Her kindergarten recommendation

16:14.640 --> 16:16.767
makes or breaks
whether he gets into The Meadows.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.144
Great. So we'll send him
to a different private school.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.022
She writes the recommendation
no matter where he goes.

16:22.022 --> 16:25.192
Great! Then it's public school.
That place wasn't that bad, and it's free.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.944
Are you kidding me?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.320
That place was that bad.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.947
- You admitted that--
- Sh.

16:30.447 --> 16:34.284
[whispers] That one was that bad.
And you said it was that bad. Okay?

16:34.284 --> 16:37.705
We have been over this.
We've looked at all the data.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.041
Oh, Jesus Christ with the fucking data!
Your generation and the data.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.710
- What?
- The data, the data, the data.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.461
Here's some data for you, okay?

16:44.461 --> 16:47.214
Not having your every need catered to
is actually a good thing.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.924
I went to public school.
I turned out fine.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.634
Where you learned to talk to principals?

16:50.634 --> 16:52.886
No, it's where I learned
to stick up for myself.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.763
You need to fix this.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.850
And you need to talk to someone
about your anger.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.102
Oh, Jesus Christ with the fucking therapy.
Here we go.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.937
- Great. Fine. Fine!
- Always with the therapy.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.148
Go ahead, white-knuckle it
through this world.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.525
But tomorrow,
you're gonna go into that school,

17:06.525 --> 17:08.402
and you are going to apologize.

17:08.402 --> 17:12.656
Good, fine. You think I'm afraid of that?
I'll go down there right now.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.324
Great.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.952
She's not the first person
I ever called that word.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.414
[whimsical music playing]

17:21.290 --> 17:23.584
Don't worry. I'll smooth it right over.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.714
Jack, Leah. Thanks so much for coming.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.800
Thank you so much
for meeting with us, honestly.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.094
Yes. Doctor Shmieckel-Turner,
I... I just wanted to--

17:34.094 --> 17:36.180
Uh, please, call me Doctor L.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.601
- Doctor L, I just wanna say--
- No, no. Save those thoughts.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.353
- [Jack] Oh, okay.
- [Lois] Uh...

17:44.521 --> 17:45.439
Oh.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.113
Oh, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.616
We're gonna do this
in front of the whole school?

17:55.616 --> 17:57.076
- [chuckles nervously]
- Um...

17:57.785 --> 18:01.914
We view this more as a village
than a school.

18:01.914 --> 18:06.376
And we firmly believe
in the practice of restorative justice,

18:06.376 --> 18:08.587
or <i>gacaca.</i>

18:09.713 --> 18:13.801
A common practice in Rwanda
which was especially effective

18:13.801 --> 18:16.512
in the aftermath of their genocide.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.515
And please, join the other parents.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.100
Oh. Okay.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.604
Okay. Wow! [chuckles]

18:26.396 --> 18:27.689
That's quite a turnout.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.277
Um... All right, um...

18:33.612 --> 18:34.947
I guess, uh, looking back,

18:34.947 --> 18:37.950
I, uh, let my emotions
get the best of me yesterday,

18:37.950 --> 18:41.954
and, um, I wish I could have chosen
my words a little bit differently.

18:41.954 --> 18:42.913
All right?

18:43.413 --> 18:47.543
And I am sorry that six of you heard this
and then told the other 40.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.796
And, uh, to any of the children
that heard what I said,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.965
it's never okay to say those words, okay?

18:52.965 --> 18:56.093
I... I was very, very wrong. All right?

18:56.718 --> 19:00.013
So that's it. Have a nice morning
and, uh, keep using those paper straws.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.975
I know they get soggy, but they're good
for the turtles, evidently.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.061
- Thank you.
- Okay. No, no. Jack. Jack. Jack.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.732
Yeah. We... we appreciate the words,

19:11.441 --> 19:14.486
but the process of healing
has only just begun.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.448
- Yes, Judy.
- [Judy] Yes, thank you.

19:18.448 --> 19:22.369
Um, I would just like to voice
how incredibly hurt I am.

19:22.369 --> 19:26.498
Mr. Kelly, do you understand
that using the C-word

19:26.498 --> 19:28.750
is like the N-word but for women?

19:31.253 --> 19:34.464
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Yeah, I'm... I'm sure... I'm sure it is.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.925
You know, other than
the 400 years of slavery

19:36.925 --> 19:38.677
and continued systemic oppression.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.054
Other than that, I think
you're making a really solid point.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.474
Yes, Mimi.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.643
Even though I wasn't there,

19:46.643 --> 19:51.148
just knowing that language like that
was used in front of the child--

19:53.483 --> 19:55.027
Oh, Jesus Christ.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.032
Please. Brian.

20:01.533 --> 20:05.704
As a parent of a child and someone
with chronically low metabolism,

20:05.704 --> 20:06.788
but loving my body...

20:06.788 --> 20:08.832
- Oh. Good for you, Brian.
- Yeah.

20:09.917 --> 20:14.546
...your use of the word "stumpy" was
a real trigger to me and my whole family.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.547
[chuckles]

20:16.381 --> 20:17.216
Seriously?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.133
Yes.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.678
Any type of body-shaming just reminds me

20:21.678 --> 20:25.140
of what it feels like to be told
that my body ain't good enough.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.725
[Jack] Oh, okay. All right.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.062
Well, I understand that,
and I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.648
And I'd also like to add,
and I think a lot of you would agree,

20:32.648 --> 20:36.735
we do have a major weight problem
in this country. Do we not, you know?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.737
And it doesn't just affect
this man and his child.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.239
I mean, the burden

20:40.239 --> 20:43.075
that out-of-shape people
put on our healthcare system,

20:43.075 --> 20:45.577
not to mention the loved ones
they leave behind is...

20:45.577 --> 20:47.454
it's truly, truly heartbreaking.

20:47.454 --> 20:51.208
And I... I think, as a community,
we should be able to talk about it.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.336
Like maybe put a salad bar at drop-off
or something like that.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.505
Oh man! I would love that.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.422
[fingers snap]

20:59.549 --> 21:01.260
All right. Maybe... maybe not now.

21:02.552 --> 21:03.804
Wrap it up. Thank you.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.514
Uh, I'd just like to say

21:05.514 --> 21:07.975
that I am truly sorry
for my actions yesterday.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.436
They have no place in this community.
Okay? All right.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.231
I'm sorry. Have a nice morning. Good day.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.649
Eh, eh. Uh...

21:15.649 --> 21:19.569
Okay. Okay, let's all thank Jack.

21:19.569 --> 21:23.407
It's not easy to admit when we are wrong.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.453
This is going to be
a long... a long journey.

21:29.162 --> 21:32.457
But I know we will all
be there to support him.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.128
[applause]

21:39.965 --> 21:42.843
What the fuck?
What does she mean by "long journey"?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.803
The journey's over.
I just apologized to her

21:44.803 --> 21:47.055
and a bunch of weak-kneed people
who weren't even there.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.226
She doesn't write Nate's recommendation
for another three months.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.478
- So?
- So!

21:54.187 --> 21:57.065
You have a long time to prove to her
that you are a good dad.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.525
But why do I need to do that?

21:58.525 --> 22:03.196
Because this recommendation is as much
about Nate as it is about us as parents.

22:03.196 --> 22:06.533
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Is it ever over with these people?

22:06.533 --> 22:09.036
I mean, how many fucking hoops
do you have to jump through?

22:09.036 --> 22:12.080
I don't know, Jack,
but you created this problem.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.835
So, are you going to man up and solve it,
or am I registering for two pacifiers?

22:16.835 --> 22:18.337
[laughs]

22:18.337 --> 22:20.297
- Well?
- All right.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.924
I will play nice, and I will jump
through all the hoops, okay?

22:22.924 --> 22:25.552
Mm-hmm. Thank you. Have a good day.

22:37.647 --> 22:40.567
Hi, baby.
I grilled up some buffalo steaks,

22:40.567 --> 22:43.153
and there's a Manhattan
waiting for you on the table.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.490
- Goddamn, baby. You look good.
- [chuckles]

22:49.659 --> 22:50.660
[Britney] Follow me.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.913
[Mike] Just what I needed tonight.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.540
Well, I do know
how to take care of my man.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.876
- [Mike chuckles]
- Go on. Sit down.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.087
Have a drink. Get all nice and relaxed.

23:01.797 --> 23:02.923
Why? What happened?

23:04.758 --> 23:05.592
Nothing.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.095
No--

23:08.762 --> 23:10.722
Okay, well,
I do have to tell you something,

23:10.722 --> 23:12.933
but you have to promise to not get mad.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.813
I went to too many years of law school
to agree to something like that.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.106
What's going on?

23:21.191 --> 23:22.234
Well,

23:23.235 --> 23:24.152
I'm late.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.195
[chuckles]

23:30.450 --> 23:32.160
There's no way. That's impossible.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.080
I couldn't believe it either.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.174
I had a vasectomy, and I pull out.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.344
I... I know.
I don't know how it happened, but...

23:51.346 --> 23:52.639
maybe there's a reason.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.059
Pee again.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.396
- What?
- Pee again!

23:59.396 --> 24:00.814
I did. Three times.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.024
Well, it's not mine, so go take a test.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.821
[doo-wop music playing]

24:12.242 --> 24:14.244
[doo-wop music continues]

24:15.996 --> 24:19.207
I mean, look at it this way.
You got really strong sperm.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.127
You should be proud.

24:23.879 --> 24:29.134
Seriously. I mean, guys our age, our cum
is usually, like, asthmatic, you know,

24:29.134 --> 24:32.888
but your shit's, like,
Bruce Willis in <i>Unbreakable,</i> bro.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.724
Yeah. To plow through
a vasectomy with pre-cum.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.434
- I mean, that's unheard of.
- Come on.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.644
That's like some <i>Braveheart-</i> level jizz.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.730
Yeah, dude.
You're like a Black William Wallace.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.482
[shouts] Pre-cum!

24:44.107 --> 24:45.108
Sorry.

24:45.692 --> 24:49.070
Mike, this is gonna be great, okay?
And remember, kids keep you young.

24:49.070 --> 24:50.155
No, they don't.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.240
My kids almost killed me.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.575
[Jack] Oh, come on.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.827
Don't you remember
the beauty of becoming a dad?

24:55.827 --> 24:58.663
The smell of a newborn baby's head.
I mean, it's the best.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.373
They're funny, Mike. They're funny.

25:00.373 --> 25:03.251
They say funny shit.
They think farts are funny.

25:03.251 --> 25:06.171
In the morning, he comes running in.
"Pull my finger. Pull my finger."

25:06.171 --> 25:08.173
- Wet one. It's funny.
- [laughs]

25:08.173 --> 25:09.299
It's adorable.

25:09.299 --> 25:12.135
Another thing, you come home,
they're excited to see you.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.846
How many places do you walk in,
and people just freak out

25:14.846 --> 25:17.015
and start running at you,
screaming your name?

25:17.015 --> 25:18.725
You come home,
you feel like you're famous.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.769
Yeah, exactly.
They don't die after 12 years.

25:20.769 --> 25:21.978
- Exactly.
- Like a dog.

25:22.979 --> 25:23.813
Hopefully.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.650
Mike, this is gonna be great.
We all get to do it together.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.651
Yeah.

25:27.651 --> 25:31.571
Jack, you've aged ten years
since Nate was born.

25:33.532 --> 25:37.369
Connor, I don't know what's up with you
'cause you don't fucking age.

25:37.994 --> 25:40.330
- Thanks, buddy.
- [Mike] It's not a compliment.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.416
I don't know
what kind of Botox shit you're on,

25:43.416 --> 25:45.252
but it's gonna kill you.

25:45.252 --> 25:49.464
All right, dude. Ease up. Okay?
I didn't fucking get you pregnant.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.635
Just... If you don't want the baby,
just get an abortion.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.303
Flush it.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.557
[scoffs] I don't believe in that.
That's some white shit.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.891
- What's that mean?
- What?

25:59.891 --> 26:01.851
I don't know. I'm emotional.

26:03.979 --> 26:07.399
She said she didn't wanna have kids.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.110
What the fuck am I gonna do?

26:11.653 --> 26:13.572
- I'm having a heart attack.
- You're not.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.408
- Can we get some water? Just breathe.
- I'm gonna have a heart attack.

26:16.408 --> 26:20.161
You're not gonna have a heart attack.
You go to the gym.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.205
Nobody has a heart attack
that goes to the gym.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.667
Except... Remember that jogging guy?
He died of a heart attack.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.502
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Remember that guy?

26:27.502 --> 26:29.004
[bell ringing]

26:29.004 --> 26:31.214
[Lois] Good morning, everyone.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.507
Morning, Doctor L.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.009
- Oh!
- [Jack] Hey, buddy.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.011
[kisses] I'll see ya. Have fun. Okay?

26:37.470 --> 26:39.139
Is that for me?

26:39.139 --> 26:42.183
Oh, it's for the whole community.
Yeah, it's an olive tree.

26:42.183 --> 26:45.270
Very drought-friendly.
And an eternal symbol of peace.

26:45.770 --> 26:50.317
I thought it'd be a nice way to cultivate
the kids', uh, social-emotional growth.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.652
Something we work on a lot
with Nate at home, you know?

26:53.653 --> 26:55.864
Well, I... I am impressed.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.618
But this tree is incompatible
with our ecosystem.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.454
The insects that it would attract

27:02.454 --> 27:05.248
would be detrimental
to all plant life here.

27:05.915 --> 27:08.168
[Lois laughing]

27:09.419 --> 27:11.296
- This is a funny moment.
- [Jack laughs]

27:11.296 --> 27:13.214
Yeah. You and I are having a--

27:13.214 --> 27:14.841
[laughs] What?

27:14.841 --> 27:19.304
I find it so apropos that you have brought
the plant version of yourself.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.224
Jack, I appreciate the effort.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.935
I know how hard this is for you.

27:26.811 --> 27:30.899
But fortunately, I am here to guide you.

27:30.899 --> 27:35.487
If you're willing to take my advice.
Is that something you'd be open to?

27:37.614 --> 27:40.116
- I need a verbal confirmation.
- Yes.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.077
Walk with me.

27:43.495 --> 27:48.208
As you can see, this is
such a dynamic and whimsical place.

27:49.751 --> 27:53.338
A launching pad
for the next generation of great leaders.

27:53.922 --> 27:54.923
Such as Nate.

27:56.383 --> 28:01.429
But they'll never reach the stratosphere
without enough fuel.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.891
Our annual fundraiser is coming up,

28:04.891 --> 28:07.936
and given your leadership experience
in sales,

28:08.687 --> 28:11.064
I think you might make a great chairman.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.776
- [laughs] Me?
- What do you think?

28:16.444 --> 28:18.655
I think I'm beginning
to see how this school works.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.784
<i>♪ Come on, baby
Let me see you with the lights up... ♪</i>

28:27.747 --> 28:29.833
Let's go. You're fucking getting to ten.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.917
- Let's go!
- Ah! I got it.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.210
- Are you a pussy?
- No.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.795
- Are you a pussy?
- You're a pussy.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.256
You're a fucking pussy.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.634
Come on. What are you, on your period?
Let's go. Look at me. Look at me.

28:39.634 --> 28:40.969
- Look at me!
- Ah, I'm looking.

28:40.969 --> 28:44.347
That's it. Let's go.
One more. One more. One more.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.809
- Come on! That's all you! That's all you!
- [straining] Fuck!

28:47.809 --> 28:49.811
All right. Let's go. Down. Down.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.439
Up high. Twice. Ah! Fuck Pilates!

28:53.481 --> 28:55.150
- Whoo!
- That was a good set.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.694
[breathing heavily]

28:57.694 --> 28:58.611
[grunts]

28:58.611 --> 29:01.197
- So, you gonna help me with this thing?
- [straining] Fuck, no.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.784
- Come on. It's just a fundraiser meeting.
- I said no.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.661
What about that time
I pretended to be your dad

29:06.661 --> 29:08.872
'cause you were lying to that chick
about your age, huh?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.166
I have no recollection of that incident.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.418
Oh, you don't? You don't?
Isn't that convenient?

29:13.418 --> 29:14.669
Hey, there's Mike.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.672
- [Jack] That Britney's car?
- [Connor] I don't think so.

29:17.672 --> 29:19.924
Look at the plates.
Someone went crazy on CarMax.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.302
You know what? I give you two-to-one

29:22.302 --> 29:24.929
there's no more baby,
and there's no more Britney.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.806
- No. You think so?
- Yeah. Fifty bucks.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.057
Fifty? Hundred.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.392
- Hundred. C-note?
- C-note?

29:29.392 --> 29:31.352
- C-note!
- C-note!

29:31.352 --> 29:32.979
- All right. Be cool.
- All right.

29:33.646 --> 29:34.606
- [Jack] Hey!
- Yo, yo, yo.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.608
- Look who's here. Big Mike!
- What's cracking?

29:36.608 --> 29:39.068
- [Jack] Man, how are you?
- [Connor] What's up, baby?

29:39.068 --> 29:41.237
- You look good.
- You get a new car?

29:41.237 --> 29:44.365
[scoffs] Ford Fusion SEL, fully loaded.

29:44.365 --> 29:46.868
Heated seats, Bluetooth, dual sunroof.

29:46.868 --> 29:50.079
Delivered straight to my door.
You wanna take it for a spin?

29:50.079 --> 29:53.124
Me? Nah, I'm good. I'll just rent one
the next time I go to Tampa.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.628
Hey, so, you and Britney
still having the kid, right?

29:57.420 --> 29:59.631
Yeah, why wouldn't we be?

29:59.631 --> 30:02.550
I don't know. Everything you're doing
is suggesting you took a mulligan.

30:03.051 --> 30:06.721
Why can't I be raising the kid
and have the car of my dreams?

30:06.721 --> 30:09.724
And pick up
a Boyz II Men pinball machine on eBay.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.560
People say it's impossible.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.105
Well, fuck those people
because I'm doing it. Huh?

30:16.105 --> 30:17.065
All right.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.567
- Fuck.
- [Mike] Let's get it in, fellas.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.736
All right. Pay up, or go to the meeting.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.904
Motherfucker.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.197
[laughs]

30:25.448 --> 30:28.034
Okay, I can get the VFW
to give us the space for free.

30:28.034 --> 30:30.662
My buddy Mitch has
a wholesale liquor company.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.249
We get the booze at cost, and that just
leaves the entertainment and the auction.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.042
Uh, but what's the theme?

30:36.042 --> 30:38.545
What's the theme?
You know, everybody takes an Uber.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.005
We all get ripped.
Take a night off from our kids.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.466
You know what? I think she's right.
I think we need a theme.

30:43.466 --> 30:45.802
- Yeah.
- [woman 1] We definitely need a theme.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.680
Last year's theme was
the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.182
- [woman 2] That was great.
- We had Tito Puente Jr.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.976
How about an '80s-themed party?

30:52.976 --> 30:54.435
[Connor] Now there's an idea.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.521
- I fucking love the '80s.
- Fucking '80s are the best.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.940
Tank tops, T-tops, and blow, baby.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.442
Finger-banging for days. <i>Miami Vice!</i>

31:01.442 --> 31:04.946
That's what started that whole thing,
sport coats with the T-shirt underneath.

31:04.946 --> 31:08.116
Yeah. No socks. Remember?
You fold over the pant, roll it up.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.909
- No... Yeah.
- Boom. Hummer.

31:09.909 --> 31:12.203
Are we reliving your childhood
or planning a party?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.538
I'm always down for a party.

31:13.538 --> 31:14.873
- I am too.
- [Connor] Right?

31:15.623 --> 31:19.335
How about "We Are the World"?
That's an interesting song. Right?

31:19.335 --> 31:21.254
And, you know, it's inclusive.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.966
Deals with Africa.
We got a lot of Black kids in the school.

31:26.175 --> 31:31.222
Uh-- Wha-- I... I mean,
I guess it is kind of inclusive.

31:31.222 --> 31:34.893
Inclusive adjacent, but some of us
weren't even born in the '80s.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.854
So I just think that, like,
why would we be looking backwards?

31:37.854 --> 31:41.024
You know? Like, our whole vibe here
at this school and this whole community

31:41.024 --> 31:44.777
is... is looking forward,
and I just don't think it really lines up.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.822
I've got it.
What about the United States of Gender?

31:47.822 --> 31:50.783
- There it is. Oh my God. I love that!
- I know. I love it.

31:50.783 --> 31:53.870
We could have an entirely trans waitstaff.
It'd be great!

31:53.870 --> 31:56.998
Okay. Wait, guys. There's gonna be a lot
of different people here at this party.

31:56.998 --> 32:00.043
Maybe we should try to keep it
a little more mainstream.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.086
Hmm. Define mainstream.

32:02.086 --> 32:05.632
I don't know, like, you know,
not turn it into, like, a tranny bar.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.885
- Oh my God!
- Tranny? You cannot say that word!

32:08.885 --> 32:10.762
- What are you supposed to say?
- [clears throat]

32:10.762 --> 32:11.804
[all] Trans!

32:11.804 --> 32:16.434
Oh, all right. Well, I was close.
Trans, tranny. It's like Mike, Mikey.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.352
Mikey!

32:17.352 --> 32:21.272
Yeah. [laughs] I mean, people call me
a ginger. I don't give a fuck.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.817
I didn't mean anything by it.
All right. Trans.

32:24.817 --> 32:28.529
I think if we could just peer through
the fog of Jack's antiquated logic,

32:28.529 --> 32:31.074
we'll all realize that Jack's trying
to bring us together, okay?

32:31.074 --> 32:34.786
He's trying to move us forward,
not polarize us, okay?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.120
Can I just... Can I just...

32:36.120 --> 32:38.206
Is there a reason we always have

32:38.206 --> 32:41.626
two white men dominating
the discussion in this room?

32:43.544 --> 32:45.129
Was that directed at us?

32:45.129 --> 32:47.632
'Cause if I'm not mistaken,
you're also a white male, buddy.

32:47.632 --> 32:51.302
Why don't you consult the results
of my 23andMe test?

32:51.302 --> 32:54.180
Because the 3% of my lineage
that is Sri Lankan

32:54.180 --> 32:57.183
is really not appreciating
your tone in this moment.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.185
So I'm gonna need you
to check your privilege.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.437
- Check my privilege?
- That's right. Check your privilege.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.524
Okay. Uh, why don't we concentrate
on the silent auction?

33:05.566 --> 33:06.734
That's not a white guy?

33:07.443 --> 33:08.444
I'm confused.

33:09.612 --> 33:11.114
[hip-hop music playing]

33:18.413 --> 33:22.917
Oh my God! Look at this place.
It just gets more depressing every day.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.338
What up, party people?

33:28.464 --> 33:30.216
[both laughing]

33:32.427 --> 33:34.637
Ah! What up, fam?

33:35.138 --> 33:39.267
Yo, y'all check out that TikTok video
of the couple exchanging clothes?

33:39.267 --> 33:40.476
What?

33:41.519 --> 33:44.188
Uh, no, I'm not actually on TikTok, man.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.691
What? What are you on an Android phone?

33:47.358 --> 33:50.194
- Yeah. As a matter of fact, I am.
- Yeah. Me too.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.447
It's open-source software.
Fully customizable.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.991
- Yes! Yes!
- Right? That's what I'm talking about.

33:56.075 --> 33:56.909
Fuck.

33:57.493 --> 34:01.247
Yo. Did you feel that earthquake
this morning? You feel that?

34:02.832 --> 34:03.666
Don't worry.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.085
It's just my thoughts.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.004
[inaudible speech]

34:08.796 --> 34:09.839
Fame.

34:10.923 --> 34:13.301
It was once only
the provenance of the talented.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.137
But now we are living in an era

34:16.137 --> 34:19.766
in which everyone believes
that they deserve to be famous.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.272
The fame bubble is big, my friends.
And it's about to burst.

34:26.272 --> 34:28.357
You can already see the cracks.

34:28.357 --> 34:31.277
Celebrities announcing they're taking
a break from social media

34:31.277 --> 34:34.864
by taking a selfie
and posting it to social media.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.032
It's insane.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.660
And we are going to make
an insane amount of money

34:40.703 --> 34:44.373
by making not wanting fame the new fame.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.251
We're gonna find a brand ambassador.

34:47.251 --> 34:51.255
Someone who earnestly does not crave fame.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.426
Introducing Ed Cameron.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.430
He is the LeBron James
of not being famous.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.517
Lives on a plot
of alopeciad land in New Mexico.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.268
He is entirely self-sustaining.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.271
And as far as we know,
he's had little to no human contact,

35:07.271 --> 35:09.023
not since the late 1980s.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.775
How did you find him?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.485
Well, it wasn't easy.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.736
But in 1976,

35:13.736 --> 35:17.073
he signed up for a raffle
at a local church.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.659
That information was sold to Mammoth Mart,

35:19.659 --> 35:22.370
who then sold it
to Columbia Record and Tape Club,

35:22.370 --> 35:25.206
who turned right around
and sold it to JPMorgan Chase.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.334
And then they got hacked,
and it ended up on the dark web,

35:28.334 --> 35:29.752
so that was a little harder to--

35:29.752 --> 35:33.589
It's not that important to talk about
how we acquired his personal information.

35:33.589 --> 35:34.507
Doesn't matter.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.135
[Aspen] What matters
is how we're gonna bring him in.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.554
And I got three words for ya.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.806
Jack, Mike, Connor, the founding fathers.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.890
[imitates explosion]

35:42.890 --> 35:44.517
Whoa, whoa! What?

35:44.517 --> 35:46.519
You want all three of us
to go pitch this guy?

35:46.519 --> 35:48.437
Yeah. Yeah, with my boy, Trav.
[tongue clicks]

35:49.897 --> 35:51.190
Why is Travis coming?

35:51.190 --> 35:53.359
Good question, Connor. I appreciate you.

35:53.359 --> 35:56.237
Hey, hey. This guy chose to live
in the middle of nowhere.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.155
[Mike] Yeah.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.991
So, how the hell are we gonna convince him
to become famous?

35:59.991 --> 36:01.534
Ah!

36:01.534 --> 36:02.618
[laughs]

36:03.578 --> 36:04.579
[remote thuds]

36:04.579 --> 36:06.330
Therein lies the work, Jack.

36:06.956 --> 36:11.502
Do you think
that Steve Jobs invented things?

36:12.128 --> 36:13.629
- Yeah. Quite a bit, actually.
- Yeah.

36:13.629 --> 36:14.547
- iPad.
- [Aspen] No.

36:14.547 --> 36:18.843
He said things,
and then other people did them.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.179
So I've said things today,

36:21.888 --> 36:26.100
and I want you to go and do those things.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.187
[apple crunches]

36:30.146 --> 36:32.148
[instrumental rock music playing]

36:37.445 --> 36:39.530
[Mike] Jack, what do you think
we're walkin' into here?

36:39.530 --> 36:42.325
I mean, you think this guy
is even gonna be able to speak English?

36:42.325 --> 36:44.118
[Connor] Yeah.
When did he go off the grid?

36:44.118 --> 36:45.870
Like, 1988.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.872
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.999
He's probably still jerkin' off
to Samantha Fox.

36:49.999 --> 36:50.958
[Mike laughs]

36:51.584 --> 36:53.127
All right, serious question.

36:53.127 --> 36:57.465
Would you rather
fuck Samantha Fox in her prime,

36:57.465 --> 37:00.801
but she's wearing a Barbara Bush mask?

37:01.302 --> 37:06.432
Or fuck Barbara Bush, circa 1988,

37:07.183 --> 37:10.353
but you get to have Samantha
just lookin' at you,

37:10.353 --> 37:12.605
full eye contact, and she's naked?

37:12.605 --> 37:15.358
- Oh, wow! That's a good one.
- [Connor] Thank you.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.526
- [Jack] You always get the left turn.
- [Connor] Mm-hmm.

37:17.526 --> 37:19.570
I mean, I think
I gotta go with the combo platter.

37:19.570 --> 37:23.574
I mean, Samantha Fox is smokin' hot,
but if I get both of them...

37:23.574 --> 37:25.076
You know, I get to look at Samantha.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.994
And Barbara Bush,
I think she was a clean woman.

37:26.994 --> 37:27.912
- You know?
- Yeah.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.623
And I've never been that close
to that level of power before.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.083
Do it in the Oval Office,

37:32.083 --> 37:34.543
you know, pick up the red phone,
see who's on the other side.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.087
The oval orifice.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.463
[all laughing]

37:37.463 --> 37:39.215
- Yeah, dude!
- See what I did there?

37:39.215 --> 37:42.051
Bunch of guys, right?
Just fuckin' hangin' out.

37:42.718 --> 37:45.930
Trashin' women. Yeah, so cool.
You guys are so dope.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.473
What, are we offending you?

37:47.473 --> 37:49.183
[Travis] No, man, you're not offending me.

37:49.183 --> 37:51.227
I just think this misogynistic behavior

37:51.227 --> 37:54.438
amongst groups of men
is a little, uh, little cliché.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.899
Ah, Jesus Christ.
We got a feminist in the car.

37:56.899 --> 37:59.235
Look, I'm just looking out
for you guys, okay?

38:00.152 --> 38:02.488
No offense,
you're just comin' across a little...

38:03.739 --> 38:05.866
A little old, you know?
A little out of touch.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.535
We try evolving.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.955
Evolving? It's a good idea.
Like your generation, right?

38:10.955 --> 38:13.958
Filmin' yourselves
while you're flippin' over water bottles.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.376
Incredible progress.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.669
If I may interject.

38:17.336 --> 38:22.091
Travis, it sounds like what you're saying
is you feel your generation

38:22.091 --> 38:24.635
is more evolved than our generation.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.095
[Travis laughing]

38:27.305 --> 38:30.433
Oh my God, that was a real question?
Yeah, absolutely. Yes.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.144
Travis, do you like rap music?

38:33.728 --> 38:35.855
I mean, yeah,
I listen to all kinds of music.

38:36.355 --> 38:39.317
You go deep, or you listen
to that mumble rap shit?

38:39.317 --> 38:40.735
No, I go deep.

38:40.735 --> 38:41.986
Really? How deep?

38:41.986 --> 38:47.158
You know, the greats.
Wu-Tang, Biggie, Nas, uh, N.W.A.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.284
N.W.A?

38:48.784 --> 38:51.329
Okay, my man Travis goes way back.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.583
Saw the movie. Bought the soundtrack.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.918
You probably know who Yella Boy is.

38:57.918 --> 38:58.961
Wow!

38:59.628 --> 39:02.631
You like to sing along to them in the car?

39:02.631 --> 39:05.009
Yeah, I rap to them sometimes. Yeah.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.219
What do you do when they drop the N-word?

39:14.143 --> 39:15.770
- [chuckles]
- You keep singing along?

39:15.770 --> 39:17.480
Uh, no, I...

39:18.147 --> 39:19.607
I...

39:20.232 --> 39:21.067
I...

39:21.567 --> 39:22.610
I listen.

39:22.610 --> 39:26.072
- You just listen?
- [Travis] Yeah. I do. I... I listen.

39:26.072 --> 39:29.658
I mean, what, do you got a pause button
in your brain? This is N.W.A.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.952
You're by yourself. Windows are up.

39:32.828 --> 39:35.122
Cruisin' down the highway. You feelin' it!

39:36.165 --> 39:39.085
Are you tellin' me
that you stop your flow?

39:39.085 --> 39:40.878
- I do.
- Bullshit, motherfucker! Nobody could.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.088
It's N.W.A.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.131
- I thought you said you loved them.
- I do.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.092
- Do you love them?
- Yes, I do!

39:46.092 --> 39:48.135
- And you stop your flow?
- No, I say it!

39:48.677 --> 39:49.678

I wanna hear how he says it.

Oh, come on, man. I don't wanna do this.
I don't wanna do this.

39:58.771 --> 40:02.358
Why not? You say it when I'm not around,
but you won't say it when I am around.

40:02.358 --> 40:06.320
That makes me feel like you're sayin' it
in a way I wouldn't wanna hear it.

I never say it, bro.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.923
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
Was that your armadillo?

41:53.177 --> 41:54.345
It is now.

41:58.724 --> 42:01.769
- The highway provides.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

42:03.938 --> 42:05.940
This, uh, might seem
like a weird question,

42:05.940 --> 42:09.443
but you wouldn't happen to be
Ed Cameron, are you?

42:11.237 --> 42:12.488
Who's askin'?

42:13.072 --> 42:15.199
Oh. Jack Kelly.

42:19.703 --> 42:22.414
Uh, we were just coming up here
to talk to you.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.508
You ain't a bunch of fags, are you?

42:34.927 --> 42:36.554
[indistinct chattering]

42:36.554 --> 42:37.846
Hey, Cara.

42:37.846 --> 42:39.223
- Yeah.
- [Leah] Hey.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.474
- Sorry.
- I'll catch you later.

42:40.474 --> 42:42.017
- Bye, Joanna.
- Sweetie, let's go.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.061
I was hoping
I was gonna run into you today.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.688
How's the second trimester?

42:45.688 --> 42:47.606
You know?
It's harder than it was with Nate.

42:47.606 --> 42:51.193
You know what? I could tell.
You're looking a little peaked.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.362
- You still working out?
- [laughing uncomfortably]

42:53.362 --> 42:54.280
Yeah.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.616
Uh, I was gonna talk to you
about Britney's baby shower.

42:57.616 --> 42:59.827
- [Colin roaring]
- And I was thinking we should-- Oh!

42:59.827 --> 43:04.373
Hey, Colin. You have to be careful, okay?
Auntie Leah's got a baby in here.

43:04.373 --> 43:05.833
Hi, baby!

43:05.833 --> 43:09.169
Colin! You are not allowed to do that,
do you understand me?

43:09.169 --> 43:10.963
Hey, hey! He's got a little extra energy.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.799
That doesn't give you the right
to scream at my child.

43:13.799 --> 43:16.385
I was just trying to protect myself.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.304
He's five years old.
He doesn't know any better.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.097
Don't you think he should?

43:21.223 --> 43:23.267
Are you calling me a bad mother?

43:23.267 --> 43:26.895
You could say I think
your parenting techniques are interesting.

43:26.895 --> 43:27.980
[scoffs]

43:27.980 --> 43:31.275
Home birth, no epidural, 4% body fat.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.402
The proof is in the pudding.

43:33.402 --> 43:35.738
Maybe if you occasionally ate
some of that pudding,

43:35.738 --> 43:37.448
you wouldn't have sweat your tits off.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.159
- Yeah.
- [gasps]

43:41.869 --> 43:44.413
I cannot wait to see
the look on Aspen's face

43:44.413 --> 43:47.583
when he congratulates us
for landing that fucking lunatic.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.422
Fucker's gonna give us all bedbugs.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.009
- Hey, Travis.
- Yo.

43:57.676 --> 43:59.887
Holy shit.
They already got him on a T-shirt?

43:59.887 --> 44:02.431
Yeah. It's the prototype,
but it's pretty fucking sick, right?

44:02.431 --> 44:05.684
So, last night, Aspen goes
to this ayahuasca ceremony,

44:05.684 --> 44:07.603
and he gets this, like, crazy vision.

44:07.603 --> 44:10.272
Memes, T-shirts, NFTs.

44:10.272 --> 44:12.191
I don't know what any of that means.

44:13.275 --> 44:17.404
I mean, dude's a crazy fucking genius.
This campaign is gonna be fire.

44:17.404 --> 44:18.530
If you say so.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.199
Hey, sorry I'm late.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.701
Hey, Connor. You see
they already got this guy on a T-shirt?

44:23.661 --> 44:24.745
Unbelievable.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.709
- What are you doin' way over there?
- I can sit wherever I want.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.338
- There a reason you're not looking at me?
- I don't know. Is there?

44:35.923 --> 44:37.341
[Aspen] Gentlemen.

44:37.341 --> 44:38.509
[laughs]

44:39.426 --> 44:42.096
You did it.
You guys crushed it. You really did.

44:42.596 --> 44:45.599
I mean, I understand now why
this company has been alive for 23 years.

44:45.599 --> 44:48.769
Yeah, well, guess these old dogs
had a little more bite left in 'em

44:48.769 --> 44:49.687
than you thought.

44:50.479 --> 44:51.313
Yeah.

44:51.313 --> 44:52.481
[laughs]

44:52.481 --> 44:54.900
We're gonna have to talk about
the rental car though.

44:54.900 --> 44:57.736
Ah, just a scratched bumper.
We have insurance.

44:57.736 --> 45:01.448
We have insurance for the car.
We don't have insurance for this.

45:01.949 --> 45:05.327
<i>Hey, let me ask you a question.
Did Caitlyn Jenner keep Bruce's dick?</i>

45:05.327 --> 45:07.371
- [Mike] <i>Like in a jar?</i>
- Where'd you get this?

45:07.371 --> 45:08.997
[Jack] <i>No, like, she still has it.</i>

45:08.997 --> 45:12.418
<i>Like, Caitlyn has tits and a dick,
and is that why you say "they"?</i>

45:12.418 --> 45:16.046
- [Mike] <i>I get what you're saying.
- Look, I'm not saying I'd bang Caitlyn.</i>

45:16.046 --> 45:19.299
<i>But, I mean, tell me that's not
a better person to watch a game with.</i>

45:19.299 --> 45:20.509
<i>That's fucking Bruce Jenner.</i>

45:20.509 --> 45:23.303
<i>I wonder, like, every four years
when the Summer Olympics come up,</i>

45:23.303 --> 45:25.597
<i>who's the first one
to call Caitlyn and be like,</i>

45:25.597 --> 45:30.060
<i>-"You wanna watch the decathlon today?"
- Yeah.</i> [laughs]

45:30.602 --> 45:33.522
[Travis] <i>I feel super fucking bad
for all your wives.</i>

45:33.522 --> 45:35.899
<i>Let me ask you something, Travis.
You ever been married?</i>

45:35.899 --> 45:37.484
<i>- No, I haven't.
- Well, there you go.</i>

45:37.484 --> 45:40.612
<i>Why don't you go up to a Marine now
and tell him what it's like in battle?</i>

45:40.612 --> 45:42.781
Did you set that camera up?
You fucking snitch.

45:42.781 --> 45:44.575
Whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no.

45:44.575 --> 45:48.454
Trav had nothing to do with this, okay?
This came from the rental car company.

45:48.454 --> 45:51.874
They sent it to us in exchange for
all of our users' personal information.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.125
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:53.125 --> 45:54.835
[Aspen] It's an information economy.

45:54.835 --> 45:57.504
They, uh, record everything
for liability and safety, apparently.

45:57.504 --> 46:00.966
Well, you know, once I saw it...
Guys, my hands are tied.

46:01.592 --> 46:02.926
Gonna have to liberate you.

46:02.926 --> 46:06.180
"Liberate" us?
Is he firing us over that bullshit?

46:06.180 --> 46:08.223
It's a bunch of guys
shootin' the shit in a car.

46:08.223 --> 46:09.892
There's no way that's fucking legal.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.269
It is, actually, in New Mexico.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.729
[laughs]

46:14.980 --> 46:17.983
Okay, fine, so we're terminated.
You still gotta pay us.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.194
Actually, we don't.

46:20.194 --> 46:24.740
Because your behavior violated the terms
of your morality clause in your contract.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.908
Morality clause?

46:26.658 --> 46:28.160
What... what's he talkin' about?

46:28.160 --> 46:31.079
So all of your equity has been liquidated,

46:31.079 --> 46:33.415
and it's been returned
to the general fund.

46:33.415 --> 46:34.333
What the fuck?

46:34.333 --> 46:37.211
[Aspen] You have to leave the premises
immediately if you don't mind.

46:37.211 --> 46:39.963
- Let's go.
- Look. The meter maids are back, huh?

46:39.963 --> 46:42.466
You hide behind these guys?
Do all your dirty work?

46:42.466 --> 46:44.009
Yeah, they're good guys.

46:44.009 --> 46:45.511
Un-fuckin'-believable.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.012
120 pounds soakin' wet.

46:47.012 --> 46:48.722
- You fucking piece of shit.
- [exhales] Wow!

46:50.307 --> 46:52.309
- [Aspen] Come on.
- Real nice, man.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.436
- Travis, can you get that?
- Yeah.

46:56.438 --> 46:58.023
Yikes, right? [laughs]

46:58.565 --> 47:01.568
You too, though, Travis. You too.

47:01.568 --> 47:02.569
What?

47:04.571 --> 47:06.657
I didn't condone anything
that was goin' on in the car.

47:06.657 --> 47:07.699
I was being vocally--

47:07.699 --> 47:09.034
<i>♪ And shit ♪</i>

47:09.034 --> 47:10.577
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah... ♪</i>

47:10.577 --> 47:12.454

- Yeah.

47:12.454 --> 47:13.455
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

47:14.665 --> 47:16.375
Why... why do you have this, Aspen?

47:16.375 --> 47:18.585
[Aspen] You got a TV with a camera.
Things could happen.

47:18.585 --> 47:19.878

47:20.462 --> 47:22.214

- Justin.
- Come on, man!

47:34.685 --> 47:36.937
Oh, Aspen, come on, man.
I was getting hyped, dude.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.690
I was... I was gettin' ready
to start my fuckin' day.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.859
I was gettin' ready
to start the day, dude!

47:42.484 --> 47:44.194
What the hell's a morality clause?

47:45.195 --> 47:47.656
It's a boilerplate clause
in every corporate contract,

47:47.656 --> 47:50.200
but I've never heard it
used in the context

47:50.200 --> 47:53.620
of secretly filming someone
in a rental car in a different state.

47:53.620 --> 47:56.123
Well, why the fuck
would you have us three knuckleheads

47:56.123 --> 47:58.750
sign a morality clause
when you know how we are?

47:58.750 --> 48:02.170
Don't you mean how you are?
Motherfucker, let me tell you somethin'.

48:02.170 --> 48:04.298
If it wasn't this, it'd be somethin' else.

48:04.298 --> 48:05.799
And now, thanks to you,

48:05.799 --> 48:07.759
I'm gonna be working until I'm 85!

48:07.759 --> 48:11.138
Oh, you're not puttin' this on me, Mike.
You're not puttin' this on me, okay?

48:11.138 --> 48:13.473
For 23 years,
you didn't miss a goddamn thing,

48:13.473 --> 48:17.477
but you were so hot to trot
to get your loaded Ford fucking Fusion,

48:17.477 --> 48:18.979
you left us exposed.

48:19.605 --> 48:21.231
Are you questioning my competency?

48:21.231 --> 48:22.858
No, I'm questioning your motivation.

48:22.858 --> 48:25.652
Guys, come on, okay?
We're all in this together.

48:26.194 --> 48:28.280
[Mike] Not anymore.
I'm done with you, Jack.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.823
You and your big fuckin' mouth.

48:29.823 --> 48:31.325
Come on, Mike.

48:32.117 --> 48:34.703
- [Connor sighs]
- Connor, why aren't you lookin' at me?

48:34.703 --> 48:36.997
Don't worry about it, okay?
I can look wherever I want.

48:36.997 --> 48:41.209
- The fuck is goin' on with you?
- Jack, we can't hang out right now, okay?

48:41.209 --> 48:43.420
Just know that there will come
a time in the future

48:43.420 --> 48:46.590
when we will be able to hang out again,
but that time is not now, okay?

48:46.590 --> 48:49.259
- It's just... It's too fuckin' weird.
- [melancholy music playing]

48:49.259 --> 48:51.178
The fuck are you talkin' about?

48:51.178 --> 48:52.763
Why don't you ask your wife?

48:53.680 --> 48:55.307
- [door opens]

48:55.307 --> 48:56.350
[Leah] Hey, babe.

48:56.850 --> 48:58.894
- [door closes]
- Did you try to fuck Connor?

48:59.394 --> 49:01.980
- Huh?
- What? What are you talking about?

49:01.980 --> 49:04.566
How come Connor said you're the reason
me and him can't hang out?

49:04.566 --> 49:06.818
- I don't--
- Answer me that, Leah. Answer me that.

49:06.818 --> 49:07.861
Oh my God.

49:09.363 --> 49:12.366
Okay. So, Cara and I got into
an argument at pickup, okay?

49:12.366 --> 49:15.118
I said she was a shitty mom
who couldn't parent her kid.

49:15.118 --> 49:16.662
- Oh!
- Oh.

49:16.662 --> 49:20.248
- Well, didn't I tell you not to do that?
- Yes, yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49:20.248 --> 49:22.000
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, but...

49:23.126 --> 49:26.838
Do you really think
that I would try and fuck Connor?

49:26.838 --> 49:30.050
- No, that was stupid.
- I mean... Come on, what are you--

49:30.050 --> 49:32.344
- I'm emotional.
- What's going on?

49:32.344 --> 49:33.553
I lost my job today.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.640
- What?
- I lost my job today.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.808
- What?
- We all did.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.852
Oh no, honey. Oh no. What happened?

49:40.852 --> 49:42.187
I don't know. I...

49:42.813 --> 49:45.649
We said some shit on that road trip,
and it got back to the office.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.111
What did you say?

49:49.611 --> 49:54.116
You know, stuff you say in a rental car
when you don't know you're bein' filmed.

49:55.409 --> 49:56.535
Can I guess?

49:57.411 --> 49:59.162
I'd appreciate it if you didn't.

50:00.497 --> 50:01.707
It wasn't that bad.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.460
Look, the real point is,
you know, I let you and the kids down,

50:05.460 --> 50:07.421
and now Nate can't go to private school.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.673
I feel terrible about that.
I'm gonna figure out a way--

50:09.673 --> 50:12.718
No. You know what?
Nate is gonna go to private school.

50:13.385 --> 50:17.431
And I don't care if we have four mortgages
on the house and I work every day

50:17.431 --> 50:20.517
until my water breaks,
but my son is not gonna get left behind

50:20.517 --> 50:23.603
because his father has
the self-control of a two-year-old.

50:24.312 --> 50:26.773
It's not self-control.
It's a right-to-privacy issue, but...

51:38.345 --> 51:42.015
<i>Man, once you get past all the God shit,
the guy's got a pretty positive message.</i>

51:42.015 --> 51:44.017
<i>And his hair is bangin'.</i>

51:44.684 --> 51:46.478
<i>He told the story
of these three sheepherders--</i>

51:46.478 --> 51:47.479
[Cara coughs]

51:52.692 --> 51:54.694
[mysterious music playing]

52:04.454 --> 52:06.123
[sighs] Fuck.

52:07.207 --> 52:08.125
[sighs]

52:09.459 --> 52:10.502
[sentimental music playing]

52:10.502 --> 52:11.461
<i>Dear Jack,</i>

52:12.170 --> 52:13.713
<i>I miss you, man.</i>

52:13.713 --> 52:16.258
<i>As you know, I was a neglected child.</i>

52:16.758 --> 52:18.969
<i>Lot of time with the Legos,
if you know what I mean, and--</i>

52:18.969 --> 52:20.637
- [door creaks]
- [eerie music plays]

52:22.305 --> 52:23.306
What are you doing?

52:23.807 --> 52:25.350
[splutters]

52:25.350 --> 52:26.643
Nothing. It's just...

52:27.227 --> 52:28.436
It's... it's...

52:29.146 --> 52:31.064
Just knockin' off a little haiku. It's...

52:31.648 --> 52:33.024
[paper burning]

52:33.024 --> 52:34.276
It's stupid. I...

52:37.404 --> 52:38.280
[blows]

52:38.822 --> 52:40.323
Let's go to bed, right, babe?

52:40.949 --> 52:42.033
I'm so tired.

52:42.534 --> 52:43.952
Uh... It's...

52:45.036 --> 52:47.038
[jazz music playing]

52:48.165 --> 52:50.167
[indistinct chattering]

52:53.795 --> 52:54.796
[bartender] Here you are.

52:54.796 --> 52:56.006
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:57.257 --> 52:58.675
- [woman] Jack!
- Hey.

52:58.675 --> 53:01.511
I mean, great party.
Everybody seems to be having a blast.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.930
- Oh, thank you.
- [man] I have to commend you.

53:03.930 --> 53:06.683
Having the foresight to see
that any party theme decided upon

53:06.683 --> 53:09.769
by a predominantly white committee
would be inherently biased...

53:10.270 --> 53:12.856
Well, your growth
really makes my heart smile.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.442
Oh, well,
I was just listenin' to the group.

53:15.442 --> 53:16.443
[laughs]

53:16.443 --> 53:19.529
Hey, who knew throwin' a party celebratin'
white people not hurtin' anyone

53:19.529 --> 53:20.906
would actually be a big hit?

53:21.489 --> 53:25.493
I'm a little surprised too.
Congratulations, Jack.

53:25.493 --> 53:27.495
Oh, thank you, Doctor L.

53:27.495 --> 53:30.248
But remember,
the real metric for the party

53:30.248 --> 53:32.167
is what it does for the children.

53:34.836 --> 53:35.795
Good luck.

53:37.088 --> 53:38.048
Thank you.

53:39.049 --> 53:39.966
Godspeed.

53:42.886 --> 53:45.096
Hey, hey. You know what?
Don't worry about her.

53:45.096 --> 53:47.390
Yeah, you're right.
This next item is gonna sell itself.

53:47.390 --> 53:50.769
If it doesn't, we can always auction off
some of our dumb jewelry.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.771
Listen, you just need to focus, okay?

53:52.771 --> 53:54.314
- Right. Right.
- Think about Nate.

53:54.314 --> 53:56.107
You know, turn on that charm

53:56.107 --> 53:58.735
I so deeply regret
falling in love with every day.

53:58.735 --> 53:59.653
[chuckles]

53:59.653 --> 54:01.780
You're gonna bring it home,
like you always do, right?

54:01.780 --> 54:04.950
- Right. Right. All right.
- Oh, uh, Connor gave me a note.

54:04.950 --> 54:08.828
Actually, he gave someone else a note
to give to me to give to you.

54:08.828 --> 54:09.788
I don't know.

54:10.538 --> 54:12.290
You're gonna be great. I know it.

54:12.290 --> 54:14.042
- I love you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

54:14.751 --> 54:18.964
[Connor] <i>Dear Jack, this situation sucks.
But I'm here for you, bro.</i>

54:18.964 --> 54:22.509
<i>I'd write more, but these gummies
are starting to kick in.</i>

54:22.509 --> 54:24.636
[sentimental music playing]

54:26.179 --> 54:27.806
[sentimental music fades]

54:27.806 --> 54:30.100
- [Cara] What are you doing?
- [pop music playing]

54:30.100 --> 54:34.145
Doin' this, girl. Ah, remember that?
The old days? What? Girls.

54:34.145 --> 54:35.063
Oh!

54:36.690 --> 54:38.692
[pop music fades]

54:42.779 --> 54:46.116
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Uh, just a little quick reminder.

54:46.116 --> 54:49.786
There's only 45 minutes left
in our silent auction.

54:49.786 --> 54:53.081
That's still plenty of time
to bid on some incredible items,

54:53.081 --> 54:56.835
including artwork
created by your own children

54:56.835 --> 54:58.837
to raise money for the school.

54:58.837 --> 55:00.297
[crowd cheering]

55:00.297 --> 55:03.633
It's not child labor
if it's for a good cause. Am I right?

55:03.633 --> 55:04.592
[crowd laughs]

55:04.592 --> 55:06.678
All right. Now, if we look
at the Doctor L-O-Meter,

55:06.678 --> 55:09.848
we are inching towards
our goal of $30,000,

55:09.848 --> 55:12.684
which brings us to the live auction.

55:12.684 --> 55:16.313
The next item we have up for bids
is something very special.

55:16.313 --> 55:17.939
I know what you're thinking to yourself.

55:17.939 --> 55:21.943
You're thinking, "Jack, how the heck
are you gonna top two floor seats

55:21.943 --> 55:23.778
to see Adele at The Forum?"

55:23.778 --> 55:25.864
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

55:25.864 --> 55:27.615
you better have
those paddles in your hands

55:27.615 --> 55:28.908
'cause I'ma tell you something.

55:28.908 --> 55:31.953
We are about ready to bid...
Get ready for this.

55:31.953 --> 55:35.707
We're about ready to bid
on two hours of uninterrupted,

55:35.707 --> 55:38.501
one-on-one time with the one and only

55:38.501 --> 55:42.839
Doctor Lois Shmieckel-Turner!

55:42.839 --> 55:45.675
- [crowd cheering]
- Yes, there she is!

55:45.675 --> 55:50.972
Two hours to glean
an entire lifetime of parental knowledge

55:50.972 --> 55:54.392
from one of
Southern California's leading educators.

55:54.392 --> 55:55.977
Now, this is crazy to me.

55:55.977 --> 55:58.063
They told me
to start this bidding at $1,500.

55:58.063 --> 56:00.190
But I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.

56:00.190 --> 56:03.026
Old Jackie boy is feeling
a little bit crazy tonight.

56:03.026 --> 56:07.280
I don't know, but since I'm having
so much fun at this "no theme" theme event

56:07.280 --> 56:09.282
that I'm gonna
get a little crazy here, people.

56:09.282 --> 56:11.785
I'm not starting
the biddin' off at $1,500.

56:11.785 --> 56:15.080
I'm gonna start it off at $2,000, huh?!

56:15.080 --> 56:18.875
Yeah! So, who's gonna
have fun with me, huh? All right.

56:18.875 --> 56:23.338
Do I hear $2,100? Who's got 21?
I got $2,100 right there.

56:23.338 --> 56:28.051
$2,100. Do I hear 22? 22! Who's got 22?

56:28.051 --> 56:33.890
Brian Dodson! Big Brian.
Not body-shaming. You look fantastic.

56:33.890 --> 56:37.060
My God! Ladies, look at this guy.
I know he's married, but you know,

56:37.060 --> 56:38.895
little side glance won't hurt you.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.272
Do I hear 23? Who's got 23?

56:41.272 --> 56:45.151
Joanna Wilkerson, who needs a nanny
who's also a personal assistant,

56:45.151 --> 56:46.528
if you can help out.

56:46.528 --> 56:49.781
All right, 24. I need 24.
Who's got 24? 24?

56:49.781 --> 56:52.409
Brian Dodson! Back to Big Brian.

56:52.992 --> 56:55.578
Oh my God!
We've got a dogfight going on here.

56:55.578 --> 56:57.372
And I'm jumping right in the middle of it.

56:57.372 --> 57:01.543
I'm not going $2,500.
I'm not going 26, 27, 28.

57:01.543 --> 57:04.087
I'm taking the elevator up
to the penthouse.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.172
I'm going $3,000!

57:06.172 --> 57:09.008
[crowd cheering]

57:09.008 --> 57:10.135
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

57:10.135 --> 57:13.304
$3,000, baby! Who's coming with me?

57:13.304 --> 57:16.724
Who's going $3,200?
Let me hear $3,200. 32.

57:16.724 --> 57:20.353
Thirty-two. Great number. OJ Simpson.
OJ Simpson scaring the white people.

57:20.353 --> 57:23.773
All right. Marcus Allen.
Who's going $3,200? Come on.

57:23.773 --> 57:25.233
[silence]

57:25.233 --> 57:29.028
All right. Old Jack, you got
a little too crazy. How about $3,100?

57:29.028 --> 57:31.739
$3,100. Who's got $3,100, huh?

57:32.323 --> 57:33.533
[silence]

57:34.242 --> 57:35.160
$3,100?

57:35.160 --> 57:36.494
[silence]

57:37.287 --> 57:40.248
All right. Come on, people.
I saw a lot of Teslas in the parking lot.

57:40.248 --> 57:41.583
[silence]

57:41.583 --> 57:44.085
Just 'cause your car's quiet
doesn't mean you have to be.

57:44.085 --> 57:45.628
- $3,100.
- [silence]

57:46.296 --> 57:49.674
Really? You're gonna let me
walk with this for $3,000?

57:49.674 --> 57:52.552
'Cause I'll tell you right now.
I'll take it. I will take it.

57:52.552 --> 57:56.264
$3,000? $3,000 going once.
$3,000 going twice.

57:56.264 --> 57:57.348
[silence]

57:57.348 --> 58:00.101
$3,000? Final time!

58:00.101 --> 58:02.937
- [silence]
- Sold to Jack Kelly!

58:02.937 --> 58:05.064
[crowd cheering]

58:08.651 --> 58:10.528
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

58:11.571 --> 58:13.573
- Hey! Old Jackie!
- [crowd cheering]

58:14.324 --> 58:15.408
Yeah! Jack Kelly!

58:16.326 --> 58:17.619
[cheering continues]

58:19.370 --> 58:22.040
All right. That concludes
this portion of the auction.

58:22.040 --> 58:24.417
We only have a few more items left to bid.

58:24.417 --> 58:27.337
Please hold onto those paddles.
We're gonna get to our goal, all right?

58:27.337 --> 58:29.130
Have a good time.
Keep drinking those drinks.

58:29.130 --> 58:31.591
I'll be back in a few moments
for the last few items.

58:31.591 --> 58:33.218
All right. Enjoy yourselves.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.929
[pop music playing]

58:43.394 --> 58:44.395
[groans]

58:48.691 --> 58:49.692
[Lois] Jack.

58:50.610 --> 58:53.446
I must thank you
for your generous donation.

58:54.197 --> 58:58.618
And I'm also quite frankly surprised
you'd want to spend two hours with me.

58:58.618 --> 59:00.036
[chuckles]

59:00.036 --> 59:02.080
Yeah. Well, I guess
I'm full of surprises, huh?

59:02.080 --> 59:03.331
[Lois] Yes. Yes, you are,

59:03.331 --> 59:07.126
considering I heard
that you lost your job and your company.

59:09.212 --> 59:12.131
How are you and your family
handling this setback?

59:13.216 --> 59:14.050
Just fine.

59:14.050 --> 59:16.511
Because we have tons of literature
that will help you

59:16.511 --> 59:19.180
through what I know
must be a very trying time.

59:19.180 --> 59:20.765
Hey, listen, Doctor L,

59:21.349 --> 59:23.017
you can drop the act, okay?

59:23.017 --> 59:24.310
Just drop the act.

59:24.310 --> 59:25.812
All right, you got my money.

59:25.812 --> 59:28.147
So now I guess my kid gets
a good recommendation,

59:28.147 --> 59:29.440
and everything's fine.

59:30.024 --> 59:33.027
Jack, I hope you aren't insinuating
that your financial commitment

59:33.027 --> 59:36.864
is going to buy
your child a recommendation.

59:36.864 --> 59:39.200
Oh, I would never do that. No.

59:40.910 --> 59:44.581
You know, Jack,
I don't fault you for the way you are.

59:45.248 --> 59:48.001
You're just blinded
by a lifetime of privilege.

59:49.919 --> 59:52.422
If I was privileged,
I don't think I'd have to spend two hours

59:52.422 --> 59:54.424
pretending I wanted to talk to you,
now would I?

59:54.424 --> 59:55.466
Excuse me?

59:55.466 --> 59:56.509
You heard me.

59:57.218 --> 59:58.761
- [Lois] I guess I did.
- [Jack] Good.

59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.681
I will take that into consideration
when I write up Nate's recommendation.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:05.435
Oh, I bet you will. I bet you will, huh?
That's how you operate?

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.605
Fuck over an innocent child
'cause you have petty bullshit with me?

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.983
Hey. You two already started talking.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.026
I, uh...

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:16.946
I hope that doesn't count
against our two hours.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.281
Hello, Mrs. Kelly.

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:21.200
Good night, Jack.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:27.457
What did you say to her?

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:31.961
I didn't do anything. She came over here.
She started twisting the knife, Leah.

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.297
What did you say to her?

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.090
Of course. Of course. What did I say?

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:39.969
What did Jack say?
Can you ever be in my corner, Leah, huh?

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.929
I just dropped three grand
that we don't have

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:44.807
to spend two hours
with that fucking egomaniac.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.018
And you come over with,
"What did Jack say?"

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.646
You know what I said? I said
what everybody is already thinking

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.981
but doesn't have the fucking balls to say.

01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:57.070
Oh, great. Great.
Now you're gonna cry, right?

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.821
- Yeah. Great.
- [sniffles]

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:01.491
You're an asshole.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.495
Oh, I'm an asshole?
Then why did I do all of this, huh?

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:09.666
What, you're mad? What?
What, Leah? 'Cause I'm honest? Huh?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.626
- Huh, Leah?
- [door slams in distance]

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.505
What the fuck
are you guys looking at, huh?

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:17.965
Yeah, I could be like you guys.

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:20.635
Pretending to care. You guys don't care.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:23.221
All you're trying to do
is not get in trouble.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.973
That's what the fuck is wrong
with your whole generation.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:27.600
[woman] Okay, boomer.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.060
Generation X!

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:30.895
[man] Slacker.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.566
[melancholy music playing]

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.489
[Jack] Here you go.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:59.424
[keys jingling]

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.052

You don't get to keep doing this

The difference is people can't smell
what I'm doing from ten blocks away.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:44.565
All right. Well, I can see
what you're doing. It's called smoking.

01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:47.276
So, till you put yours out,
I'm not putting mine out. How about that?

Uh, what the fuck is your problem?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.679
What's my problem?
My problem is I live in a world

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:18.099
where a guy who's smoking
is telling me I can't smoke, all right?

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:19.976
That, in a nutshell, is my problem.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.520
Well, in a nutshell, it's not smoking.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.313
What makes it smoking, buddy,

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:27.900
is the fucking smoke
coming out of your mouth, all right?

before I throw you in that fucking pool?

I'm in actual fucking pain,
which is something you can't relate to

you don't wanna be with me anymore?

No. No, babe.

01:33:32.648 --> 01:33:36.360
I'm just telling you that I don't wanna
live my life this way anymore.

01:33:36.902 --> 01:33:39.030
I would like to be less afraid of you.
