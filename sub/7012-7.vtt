00:04.500 --> 00:06.340
Hey, Mrs. Forman.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.780
My dad's making a cheese sandwich,
but he's missing some stuff.

00:08.860 --> 00:11.780
So, can I borrow
bread and cheese?

00:11.860 --> 00:16.059
Oh, your dad's having a hard time
without your mom, isn't he?

00:16.100 --> 00:20.020
Midge was the brains of that outfit?

00:20.100 --> 00:22.660
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, Donna.

00:22.740 --> 00:27.060
- Sorry about what?
- You, get Donna bread and cheese.

00:27.140 --> 00:29.460
Okay.

00:29.540 --> 00:32.140
Wow. This is a really nice dress.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.780
I know. Isn't it fancy?

00:34.820 --> 00:37.540
It's for the Price Mart Ball
tomorrow night.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.940
Oh, right, the Price Mart Ball.

00:40.020 --> 00:43.220
So who you takin'?
Who's the lucky lady?

00:43.300 --> 00:46.060
Oh, well, I decided not to go.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.980
Personal choice.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.420
You don't have a date, do you?

00:50.500 --> 00:52.340
Okay. You know what?

00:52.420 --> 00:54.260
It's not about, "Can I get a date?"

00:54.340 --> 00:57.900
It's about this great book that I'm,
like, halfway through.

00:57.980 --> 01:00.340
Plus, you know, I could get a date.

01:00.420 --> 01:03.700
I've got numbers, buddy.

01:03.780 --> 01:06.740
Sure you do, honey.
You're number one with me.

01:08.260 --> 01:12.100
You're going tomorrow night.
And you'd better not go stag, Eric.

01:12.180 --> 01:16.060
There's nothing worse than an 80-pound boy
dancing with his mommy all night.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.460
You know what?
I'll go.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.380
I told you I would,
like, months ago.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.980
But that was before the...

01:24.060 --> 01:25.900
ugliness.

01:25.980 --> 01:28.060
Eric, I'm over it.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.620
Hey, I'm over it.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.260
Oh, I'm... I'm over it.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.060
Plus, I mean, last year they had
all-you-can-eat shrimp.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.580
Well, I mean, you know, I'm over it.

01:42.660 --> 01:44.500
Hey, I'm over it.
Yeah, I'm over it.

01:44.580 --> 01:49.580
I was just worried that you might think
it was weird, us going out on a date.

01:49.660 --> 01:52.740
So, I mean, you know,
the concern laid with you.

01:52.820 --> 01:55.620
Eric, it's not a date.

01:55.660 --> 01:58.580
It's not... I know. I know it's not a date.
It's not a date.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.940
It's a...

02:01.020 --> 02:03.100
shrimp fest.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.980
A festival of shrimp, if you will.

02:06.020 --> 02:07.820
- Exactly.
- Okay.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.820
- I'll see you tomorrow night.
- 'Kay.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.180
See, now, look.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.580
My little prince is going to the ball.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

02:51.000 --> 02:54.560
So, Forman, you break up with Donna...

02:54.640 --> 02:57.200
but you still get to have sex
and go on dates with her?

02:57.280 --> 02:59.960
Ride the big red wave, dude.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.600
I should break up with Donna.
"Donna, we are through.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.560
Let the sex and dating begin."

03:09.320 --> 03:11.720
Oh, no. It's not a date.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.400
We're just friends now,
because she's over it.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.520
- Well, guess who else is over it?
- I am.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.960
- Me too.
- So over it.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.400
Look, man, breaking up sucks, okay?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.400
When Jackie dumped me,
you know what she said?

03:27.480 --> 03:30.600
"Somethin' somethin'.
Never wanna see you again.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.760
Blah, blah, blah."

03:32.840 --> 03:35.200
Hey, you think that didn't hurt?

03:35.280 --> 03:37.160
Okay. You know what?

03:37.200 --> 03:39.520
- I'm done talking about this.
- Good.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.120
But I will say this.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.400
If she doesn't want it to be a date,
then it won't be a date.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.040
I am so cool with that,
because as we all know...

03:48.120 --> 03:50.400
I am very mature.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.480
Now, if you would all
please excuse me...

03:52.560 --> 03:55.480
my mommy has to iron my corduroys.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.960
Ah, women.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.880
Am I right, guys?

04:03.920 --> 04:06.520
Ah, who am I kidding?

04:06.600 --> 04:08.880
There's no woman for Fez.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.600
What must Fez do to get a woman?

04:12.680 --> 04:15.200
Well, for one thing,
he's gotta cut out that third-person crap.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.120
It's weird.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.079
You <i>are</i> Fez.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.000
You know somethin' else?

04:22.079 --> 04:23.920
Shoes say a lot about a man.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.240
In your case, your chukka boots
are screaming "virgin."

04:30.080 --> 04:32.840
Damn you, boots.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.800
What else have you told them?

04:36.080 --> 04:37.920
Hey, Fez...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.680
seeing you wear those chukkas
makes me wanna up-chukka.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.760
- Nice.
- Yeah.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.360
It's like I ate too many
"chukkalate" chip cookies.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.120
Okay.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.240
Yeah, how much wood
could a "woodchukka" chukka...

04:52.320 --> 04:55.160
Hey. Shut the chukka up.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.960
How am I supposed
to afford new boots?

04:58.000 --> 05:02.680
My Bible-thumping host parents won't give me
an allowance because I am a pagan.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.640
You know, Leo's looking
for help down at the Fotohut.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.280
The Fotohut, huh?

05:10.360 --> 05:13.560
I can really "picture" myself there.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.560
That job and I will really "click."

05:18.640 --> 05:21.040
Oh, I am on a "roll"...

05:21.120 --> 05:23.560
of film.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.680
Ow.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.600
Don't be so... "negative."

05:31.920 --> 05:34.160
I am the king.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.680
You sure you wanna get in
the Fotohut game?

05:40.760 --> 05:44.560
It can chew you up and spit you out
like a stick of gum.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.200
Or something that seemed edible
till you put it in your mouth...

05:47.280 --> 05:49.680
and then you realized it's not.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.600
Or a stick of gum.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.520
- What kind of gum?
- Big Red.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.960
Oh, that's fine.

05:56.040 --> 06:00.200
Okay, you're hired.
But you're on probation.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.880
No, wait. I'm on probation.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.560
Oh, wow. I gotta go see
my probation officer.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.880
- So he's my new boss?
- Welcome to paradise.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.400
Oh, Red.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.840
Don't the kids look nice
for their date?

06:25.920 --> 06:28.440
Yeah. Nice as hell.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.640
- Oh, well, thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Actually, Mom...

06:31.720 --> 06:35.440
as Donna so thoughtfully pointed out earlier,
this isn't a date.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.360
Well, I just...
I like seeing you together.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.400
You just... You look so natural.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.440
But we're not together.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.160
Well, sure you are.
I'm looking right at you.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.120
Let's spend the night in the driveway
looking at the kids.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.680
That's what I wanna do.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.680
Oh, hang on one sec.
Oh, hey, Donna?

06:57.720 --> 07:00.360
Why don't you make like a circle
and go round, okay?

07:00.440 --> 07:02.320
That's right. Like a circle.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.080
Slide over or I'll hit you in the head.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.040
All right.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.160
- You got yelled at.
- Shut up.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.640
Oh, okay, this is us.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.680
See? This is great.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.960
Being out together,
not on a date, just friends.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.920
I feel, like, virtually nothing for you.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.840
Me too. Here. Let's have a seat.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.040
Here you go.
Oh, whoops. Not a date.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.960
- Eric!
- I'm sorry.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.680
Okay, uh, minor glitch.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.040
Let's let the good times roll.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.760
Isn't this nice?

07:48.840 --> 07:52.640
Okay, Kitty. Enough jawin'.
Drinks are only free for the first two hours.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.640
Oh, do you think
they have peach schnapps?

07:54.720 --> 07:57.480
Peach is my favorite schnapp.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.560
Hi. I'm Lyle, Housewares manager in Oshkosh.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.520
Hi. Eric, stock boy, Point Place.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.200
And this is my friend...

08:07.280 --> 08:09.120
Donna.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.400
We're not on a date, even though, I mean...
even though I did pay for her.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.760
But what can you do?
Tell me, Lyle. Are you here on a real date?

08:15.840 --> 08:19.400
Uh... Hey, that's Stewie. Stewie.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.880
Nice going. Scared off Lyle.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.160
Now we'll never meet Stewie.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.080
Eric, what is wrong with you?

08:30.160 --> 08:32.480
Hey, guy. Put your arm
around your date.

08:32.559 --> 08:36.320
- Oh, no, she's not my date...
- Oh, just shut up and take the picture.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.720
Ta-da!

08:50.640 --> 08:52.840
Quittin' time, chief?

08:54.400 --> 08:56.240
No.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.240
I devised a system
to streamline our operations.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.600
From now on, all orders
will be filed alphabetically.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.160
So the size of a customer's boobs?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.360
No longer a factor.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.840
You see, it saves time.
And time, my friend, is money.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.840
But money is not time.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.320
You'd think it would go both ways,
but it doesn't.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.760
Hey, Moby Dick called.
He wants his shrimp back.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.840
It's those hilarious jokes that
I miss so much since we broke up.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.920
So, uh...

09:38.000 --> 09:39.920
should I get us some punch or...

09:40.000 --> 09:42.120
Wait. Do you get the punch? Oh, no.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.280
How do we get the punch?

09:44.360 --> 09:47.400
Eric, stop it. You're being an ass.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.680
Well, why don't you just,
you know, get over it?

09:51.920 --> 09:55.360
I only said that because
I wanna be friends again.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.640
I mean, I wish we could pretend that
we were never boyfriend and girlfriend...

09:58.720 --> 10:01.600
and just, you know, be friends.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.520
Donna, it's hard.
It's not like being friends with Hyde, okay?

10:04.600 --> 10:07.200
I haven't, you know...

10:07.280 --> 10:09.960
touched his fun parts...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.880
well, on purpose.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.680
- We used to have a lot fun together.
- Yeah.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.480
Just like there used to be
shrimp in the world.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.240
- Okay.
- Hmm.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.160
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.640
When I get back, we're gonna
have a lot of fun together.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.560
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.960
Hello.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.800
Hi, I'm Connie.
Pet Supplies, Sheboygan.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.920
You, uh, wanna dance?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.080
Oh, uh...

10:49.160 --> 10:51.440
Yeah, I'm kind of here
with someone so...

10:51.520 --> 10:53.960
Okay. Well, um,
maybe I'll see you around.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.880
Okay.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.880
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Okay, you hurt my arm.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.040
She was a real looker.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.280
And for some reason
she talked to you.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.400
- Now go get her.
- What? No.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.320
Dad, Donna's here.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.720
Well, Donna's off having fun
while you're sittin' here being a big lump.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.600
Okay, first of all...

11:18.640 --> 11:21.120
you are way too involved
with my life, okay?

11:21.200 --> 11:25.320
And second of all, Donna's not having fun.
She's in the bathroom.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.800
That's not the bathroom.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.280
Now, go talk to that girl
before she comes to her senses...

11:39.360 --> 11:42.480
and wants nothing
to do with you.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.840
Oh, God. Your mother's doing shots
with Gladys from Housewares.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.240
Kitty, put it down.

11:58.560 --> 12:01.360
My wife left me. I don't cook.
I don't shop. I'm hungry.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.040
This place scares me,
and I like Salisbury steak.

12:04.120 --> 12:07.520
So you don't cook or shop,
and your idea of a nice meal...

12:07.600 --> 12:10.000
is gristly hamburger
smothered in goo?

12:10.080 --> 12:12.600
What woman could
let all that go?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.720
Hey, I've got an upside.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.320
Th-There are things.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.360
I know. You're a good guy...

12:21.440 --> 12:24.360
a good, old-fashioned,
out-of-touch, Stone Age guy.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.440
But, you know, there's
nothing wrong with you...

12:26.520 --> 12:28.880
that changing yourself
completely couldn't fix.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.040
Thank you.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.200
Here. In the meantime,
have a pretzel.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.320
- I can tell you haven't eaten anything.
- I am pretty hungry.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.480
Oh, never shop when you're hungry...

12:39.560 --> 12:42.440
'cause you'll end up at home
with 15 Salisbury steaks.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.360
Give me those.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.480
See, the problem is
I have a daughter at home.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.080
I think I'm gonna
have to start feeding her.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.360
I don't think I can do this.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.720
Of course you can't.
Lucky for you, I'm here.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.920
Now we just gotta find everything
you need to make a meat loaf.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.920
Wow. You're gonna
make me a meat loaf?

13:02.960 --> 13:05.320
No. You're gonna
make <i>me</i> a meat loaf.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.280
Okay, but sometimes
I burn myself on the oven.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.120
- I'm, uh... I'm Bob.
- Joanne.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.120
Now haul ass, Bob.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.360
- Oh.
- Oop. Oh, sorry. Sorry.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.880
Oh, Donna. Oh, oh.
So, are you having fun at the big ball?

13:27.960 --> 13:30.600
Um, yeah. You know,
at first I wasn't.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.880
- Eric was being really jerky and weird.
- Uh-huh.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.560
Well, he does that.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.920
If he gets me a glass of punch,
it's not like we have to sleep together.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.480
Well, it would have to be
pretty good punch.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.640
They have an open bar.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.120
Uh! I just wish Eric could relax.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.320
Well, um, I think he can.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.360
<i>Oh. Oh. Oh, good for him.</i>

13:58.440 --> 14:01.880
I'm... I'm glad.
He's dancing with a beautiful...

14:01.960 --> 14:03.800
skank!

14:11.460 --> 14:14.140
Well, I will say this
about Price Mart:

14:14.180 --> 14:16.500
They have wonderful balls.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.220
Red, grab that centerpiece.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.940
Oh, hey. Here's another.

14:26.020 --> 14:29.140
Donna, honey, grab that centerpiece.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.620
Kitty, how many centerpieces do we need?

14:31.700 --> 14:34.620
Red, they are center <i>pieces!</i>

14:41.780 --> 14:45.140
- Okay, so don't lose my number, all right?
- All right.

14:51.860 --> 14:55.420
Eric, what the hell?

14:55.460 --> 14:58.780
- What?
- Why are you kissing her?

14:58.860 --> 15:01.940
- You're on a date with me.
- It wasn't a date.

15:02.020 --> 15:04.580
Well, it is now, you bastard!

15:04.660 --> 15:07.500
Now come open my car door for me
before I kick your ass!

15:11.220 --> 15:13.380
The Fotohut's cool.

15:13.460 --> 15:16.060
Hyde, your job kicks ass.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.780
Yeah. I never thought
I'd be a workingman, man.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.820
But, man, here I am...

15:22.900 --> 15:24.860
working for the man.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.100
And you know what, man?

15:27.140 --> 15:29.540
I like the man.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.620
Hey, thanks, man.

15:33.420 --> 15:37.900
So, my probation officer
was sure happy I came by.

15:39.540 --> 15:42.540
He even wants to see me
for some additional years.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.900
He's a good guy.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.540
Ugly, fat, whorey, old...

15:48.580 --> 15:53.340
whorey, old, four-eyes, ugly, fat.

15:53.380 --> 15:56.060
Oh, this one's kinda cute.

15:56.140 --> 15:59.460
I mean, for a fatty.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.460
I mean, for a whore?

16:03.540 --> 16:07.180
Damn, Jackie! What do you want me to say?

16:09.300 --> 16:11.860
That's it. I cannot work like this.

16:11.940 --> 16:13.980
Anyone who doesn't
have to be here must leave.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.420
- Fez...
- I said, leave.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.020
Damn, Fez. You've only
been here one day...

16:22.100 --> 16:24.860
and you're already trying
to change everything.

16:24.940 --> 16:29.300
Yeah. It's like we crossed into
some different dimension...

16:29.380 --> 16:31.780
where we're in some kind of...

16:31.860 --> 16:33.700
Fotohut.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.460
It's eerie, man.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.340
And then you encourage him
and what happens?

16:41.420 --> 16:45.780
He ends up kissing a girl
while he's on a date with another girl.

16:45.860 --> 16:51.540
Once again, an open bar spells disaster
for the Forman family.

16:54.420 --> 16:56.340
Red, I am not drunk.

16:56.420 --> 16:58.260
I am upset...

16:58.340 --> 17:00.180
and drunk.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.500
All I know is that is not the way
to behave on a date.

17:05.579 --> 17:08.060
It wasn't a date.

17:08.140 --> 17:10.060
Oh, please.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.740
Good morning.

17:17.819 --> 17:21.020
No. It was morning
when I got here, on time.

17:23.819 --> 17:25.740
Now, put this on.

17:28.099 --> 17:31.540
Clever, huh? Yes, very.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.940
Fez...

17:36.020 --> 17:38.580
Working here is about goofing off...

17:38.660 --> 17:41.580
you know, creating a model of inefficiency.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.500
You're ruining the Fotohut, man.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.460
And if you think I'm gonna stand idly by...

17:45.540 --> 17:47.420
you're right, 'cause that's what I do here.

17:51.340 --> 17:53.540
Oh, Hyde, you're here early.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.020
Oh, slick uniform, man.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.940
Is that how you spell Fotohut?

18:00.020 --> 18:02.900
Yes, but Hyde won't wear it.

18:05.020 --> 18:08.740
- Something's gotta change around here, man.
- Amen.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.060
I don't like what's goin' on here, man.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.380
That little dude's
making us all look bad.

18:21.580 --> 18:25.340
- I'm afraid the boss is gonna fire me.
- Leo, you are the boss.

18:27.380 --> 18:30.700
Did you fire him yet?
I'll take his shifts.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.540
Hey, dude, man.

18:34.620 --> 18:37.100
I think we decided
that <i>you're</i> fired.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.180
Oh.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.340
Well, that's a cold slap in the groin.

18:43.340 --> 18:45.300
How am I supposed to afford
my new boots?

18:45.380 --> 18:47.780
Here. Just do what I do, man.

18:47.860 --> 18:52.420
Just get some money out of the register
when the boss isn't lookin'.

18:54.020 --> 18:56.780
Once again, Leo, you are the boss.

18:56.860 --> 18:58.900
And I'm not lookin'.

19:13.780 --> 19:17.660
- Hey, kissy-face.
- Ah, well.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.900
If it isn't...

19:19.980 --> 19:24.500
Kooky McShrimplover,
who doesn't know how she feels.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.420
Comin' over here like everything's normal
and nothin' happened last night.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.060
Yep. That's my Kooky McShrimplover.

19:31.140 --> 19:34.300
I know. I freaked out. I'm sorry.

19:36.940 --> 19:38.820
Well, that's a first.

19:38.860 --> 19:43.780
Well, this is complicated, okay?
I mean, we do wanna be friends, right?

19:43.860 --> 19:46.580
Yeah. I don't wanna be nothing.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.580
Okay. Well, then,
maybe some rules will help.

19:48.660 --> 19:51.260
Like, when we're out on a date
that's not a date...

19:51.340 --> 19:54.780
- we can't make out with slutty girls.
- Uh-huh.

19:54.820 --> 19:58.900
Or that could just
be a rule for me.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.540
Yeah, I mean, Donna, feel free...
No. Feel encouraged...

20:01.620 --> 20:04.100
to make out with all
the slutty girls you want.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.140
What is this?

20:09.220 --> 20:12.540
Is this...
Kissy girl's phone number?

20:12.620 --> 20:15.380
Uh-huh.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.340
Okay, see ya.

20:21.600 --> 20:26.240
I got it. Her phone number is 729-36.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.440
I think there are a couple
more numbers than that.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.600
Really? Oh, yeah.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.640
It's 729-36...

20:37.640 --> 20:39.520
ampersand?

20:41.560 --> 20:45.560
Maybe, but I just don't
really know how to dial that.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.680
Just... Oh, yeah. That'd be hard.
