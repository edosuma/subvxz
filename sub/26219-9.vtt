I basically tell Ceez,
I don't wanna work with her.

it's either me or Tokie.

putting a [bleep] ultimatum

- Every tattoo machine
I give you, something happens,

10:19.185 --> 10:20.586
so let me see which one I have.

10:20.653 --> 10:23.089
I'm not gonna give you
one of the new ones.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.524
{\an8}- My relationship with Lalo
hasn't always been perfect,

10:25.591 --> 10:28.461
{\an8}we've had some really crazy
ups and downs this last year,

10:28.527 --> 10:31.230
{\an8}from the IRS hitting me
with this outrageous bill...

10:31.297 --> 10:33.299
- What is this all about?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.201
- I thought I paid
my taxes correctly.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.636
- Well, the IRS doesn't think
you paid [bleep].

10:37.703 --> 10:40.206
- To subletting our apartment
and moving into this tiny,

10:40.272 --> 10:42.842
cramped RV so we could
pay back the government...

10:42.908 --> 10:46.145
She's hungry because I can't
[bleep] make breakfast for her.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.382
- You know what? We had a home,
but you got in debt.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.617
- Just being parents
to a toddler, and you know,

10:51.684 --> 10:53.252
Lalo owning his own business,

10:53.319 --> 10:55.454
things have just been...
really stressed,

10:55.521 --> 10:58.090
but lately things
have gotten worse.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.492
It's like we're getting
into arguments

10:59.558 --> 11:00.693
over the smallest things

11:00.760 --> 11:03.229
and I'm constantly walking
around on eggshells.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.764
- Awesome, brother,
thank you very much

11:04.830 --> 11:08.067
and call me whenever
there's waves.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.870
- MELODY: Um...
can I borrow a machine?

11:10.936 --> 11:12.304
- [sighs]

11:14.106 --> 11:15.341
I mean, I gotta clean,

11:15.408 --> 11:17.076
you know I hate
to leave the table...

11:17.143 --> 11:19.678
- Well, I'm gonna end up
running late for my appointment,

11:19.745 --> 11:21.047
like--
- You're always late,

11:21.113 --> 11:22.815
so what is the difference?

11:22.882 --> 11:24.350
- What is your problem?

11:26.052 --> 11:27.353
- Tell me what is my problem.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.754
- Just always [bleep]
complaining,

11:28.821 --> 11:29.922
I can't do anything right,

11:29.989 --> 11:31.157
I don't know
what the [bleep]

11:31.223 --> 11:32.625
you're so upset about.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.360
- Well, 'cause I'm...

11:34.427 --> 11:38.397
I feel like I'm waking up every
day to the same movie, man.

11:38.464 --> 11:41.100
- What--what is your problem?
For real.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.701
Because I feel like no matter
what,

11:42.768 --> 11:44.270
I can't [bleep] make you happy.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.539
- The fact that you're even
asking me this, just...

11:46.605 --> 11:49.108
blows my mind how
you don't even know

11:49.175 --> 11:51.444
what this whole thing is about.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.546
When we opened this place,
we opened it

11:53.612 --> 11:55.548
'cause we wanted
to be together and be here

11:55.614 --> 11:57.550
and make all the money for us,
and like,

11:57.616 --> 11:58.951
we had a destination,

11:59.018 --> 12:00.786
we wanted to do
all these things together.

12:00.853 --> 12:05.057
You decide to go working on
a [bleep] stupid shop up there,

12:05.124 --> 12:07.059
I don't know what
is going on there.

12:07.126 --> 12:08.727
I hate that place.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.163
- You know why I work there,
it is a good shop.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.832
It's a big brand.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.467
- It's a big brand of what?

12:14.533 --> 12:16.569
All they do is go
to strip clubs and get wasted,

12:16.635 --> 12:18.437
that's all I see
on their Instagram.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.339
I don't see tattoos,
I don't see anything.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.674
- It is good for my career,

12:21.740 --> 12:23.709
I don't understand
why you don't see that.

12:23.776 --> 12:24.877
- Look at you!

12:24.944 --> 12:26.846
Your wig is on point,
your makeup is on point,

12:26.912 --> 12:28.280
but you don't have
a tattoo machine.

12:28.347 --> 12:29.915
- What the [bleep]
are you talking about?!

12:29.982 --> 12:32.151
- You have become a person
I don't like!

12:37.022 --> 12:39.558
- Wow, I knew Lalo
was pissed at something,

12:39.625 --> 12:42.595
but I wasn't expecting
to hear that.

12:42.661 --> 12:45.598
That...that hurts,
that really [bleep] hurts.

12:45.664 --> 12:48.200
You're gonna say
that you don't like who I am?

12:48.267 --> 12:49.902

12:49.969 --> 12:52.571
we were gonna do this together,
we had these goals,

12:52.638 --> 12:54.206
because you wanted to be
a better artist,

12:54.273 --> 12:56.342
because you were gonna
make me a better artist.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.312
You have abandoned our world!

13:00.379 --> 13:02.114
I don't know what you
stand for anymore.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.283
- What [bleep]
are you talking about?

13:04.350 --> 13:05.951
- Your life is out there,

13:06.018 --> 13:08.354
and I don't want
any part of that,

13:08.420 --> 13:11.490
and I don't want my kid
to grow up like that.

Give me a hug!

13:37.750 --> 13:40.286
I got so much to tell you.

13:40.352 --> 13:43.322
First. Me and Dez, just...
we're over here like,

just chilling 'cause
you wasn't here,

13:45.324 --> 13:50.462

I turn to greet the person...

13:51.363 --> 13:54.800
it was Genesis!

13:54.867 --> 13:56.435
- What?
- SKY: Genesis.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.205
- Stop playing.
- I swear, bro, it was Genesis.

13:59.271 --> 14:02.708
- [bleep] Get outta here,
Genesis came in that shop.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.045
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.913
That [bleep]
shook you up, right?!

14:09.215 --> 14:10.983
Thank you.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.418
- Wow.
- SKY: That's what I'm saying.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.320
- Yo, I'm beyond shocked
right now.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.488
{\an8}I remember last year
when I tried to reunite them,

14:16.555 --> 14:19.091
{\an8}how Genesis was holding on
to all that pain and hurt,

14:19.158 --> 14:20.993
{\an8}I thought that [bleep]
would never happen.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.761
- I wanted my mama
when I had my mama,

14:22.828 --> 14:26.465
but I didn't get that--
I wanted a [bleep] home!

14:26.532 --> 14:29.535
- I guess, you know,
he had to work his own [bleep]

14:29.602 --> 14:30.569
in his own time.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.439
Wow, the mother of two
handsome boys.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.143
Welcome, grandmother Sky.
- Oh, thank you.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.412
- I cannot wait to get you
that rocking chair

14:40.479 --> 14:42.047
and sit your old ass down.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.049
- Shut the [bleep] up, okay?

14:44.116 --> 14:46.585
I'm gonna be the mother
of a boy

14:46.652 --> 14:49.722
that's on "The First 48."
- What?

14:49.788 --> 14:52.091
- I don't know, mother,
grandmother, some--

14:52.157 --> 14:55.728
- Who? Genesis?
- No, [bleep] Dez.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.563
- Dez?!
- SKY: Yes.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.834
Listen, his friend
got killed in his house.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.037
Him and his buddy,
they had an apartment,

15:05.104 --> 15:09.275
and they shot through the door
and his friend...passed away.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.279
Dez totally said
he wasn't there,

15:13.345 --> 15:14.947
so I gotta go by what he say.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.216
- Oh, God.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.685
- I don't know
what's going on in Texas.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.655
I just don't know how
I'm supposed to tackle this.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.657
{\an8}I know Dez told me
he's not on the streets,

15:24.723 --> 15:27.760
{\an8}but...I can't help but worry
he's with the wrong people.

15:27.826 --> 15:29.795
And since he's not going
to boot camp,

15:29.862 --> 15:32.865
and not going to college
until next year,

15:32.931 --> 15:35.634
I'm really worried
that he has no structure

15:35.701 --> 15:38.270
and I just wanna make sure
he stays out of trouble.

15:38.337 --> 15:43.742
- I remember them times, man,
that age...yo...

15:43.809 --> 15:46.145
I don't think Dez should go
back to Texas.

15:46.211 --> 15:47.880
- Where do you think
he should go?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.950
- Stay up here.

15:53.652 --> 15:56.355
You know when we was little
how we used to get into [bleep].

15:56.422 --> 15:58.324
We had nobody like us.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.494
When I was Dez's age,
I was selling drugs,

16:02.561 --> 16:05.464
shooting that [bleep]
doing all kinds of [bleep]...

16:05.531 --> 16:08.133
Best thing somebody could've
done for me back then

16:08.200 --> 16:11.704
is get me away from all the bad
things and bad influences.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.038
That's a good kid.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.506
He just hit a stumble, yo.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.109
- I just don't want it
to be on a downhill stumble--

16:17.176 --> 16:18.477
- CEASER: That's what it is.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.480
We just gotta catch

16:21.547 --> 16:24.917
Dez has to stay in New York,
see if it makes a difference.
