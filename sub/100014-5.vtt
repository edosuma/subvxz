01:27.463 --> 01:30.257
But the evil was not over.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.636
Before the poor fae's body
was cold,

01:33.677 --> 01:37.056
the headmaster was struck down.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.018
And so, there were two lives

01:41.060 --> 01:43.604
cut short before their time,

01:43.646 --> 01:45.981
both man and fae,

01:46.023 --> 01:49.652
their fates entwined
by a death most cruel,

01:49.693 --> 01:52.488
delivered by a fiend most foul.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.582
But will they get
the justice they deserve?

02:03.624 --> 02:06.252
Only time will tell.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.711
But of this much
we may be certain:

02:08.753 --> 02:11.006
that each, in their own way,

02:11.048 --> 02:14.134
earned their eternal reward.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.224
Good Master Finch

02:20.266 --> 02:22.643
bathes in the light
of the Martyr

02:22.685 --> 02:24.854
he served all his days.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.981
And Aisling...

02:27.022 --> 02:29.817
sweet, sweet Aisling,

02:29.859 --> 02:32.653
entertains the seraphim
with her song.

03:18.908 --> 03:20.993
Thank you so much. Oh.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.164
Moira.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.667
So...

03:28.709 --> 03:31.170
This is it, is it?

03:32.588 --> 03:35.049
Your humble little
theatrical troupe?

03:35.090 --> 03:37.801
I'm afraid so. It's, um...

03:41.805 --> 03:43.390
I thought the show was lovely.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.018
Really?
I'm so glad you liked it.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.146
- What's all this, then?
- Uh...

03:49.188 --> 03:52.066
Oh...
Is there a problem, Constable?

03:52.107 --> 03:54.068
Well, it depends.
Let's see your permit.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.445
- Permit?
- Well, it's a public street, isn't it?

03:56.487 --> 03:57.821
Leave him alone, would you?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.448
And I'll need to see
their papers.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.209
This lichen's gone yellow.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.128
I'll give you ten stivers
for the whole lot.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.838
Off with you.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.464
Thieving witch.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.220
Back this soon?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.305
Yes, I am.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.694
What does this say?

04:36.735 --> 04:39.071
"Repository of secrets."

04:40.531 --> 04:43.409
The liver holds multitudes...

04:43.450 --> 04:46.036
for those who know how to see.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.834
Do you have something
to show me or not?

04:59.008 --> 05:00.384
By the Martyr.

05:00.426 --> 05:03.095
Oh, anything but.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.014
So it's true, then?

05:05.055 --> 05:06.890
A dead thing
can be raised to life

05:06.932 --> 05:08.350
and joined with another.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.103
As your own eyes can attest.

05:11.145 --> 05:14.440
The thing I saw
the other night, it had...

05:14.481 --> 05:16.108
intelligence.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.194
- I could sense it somehow.
- No.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.238
What you sensed...

05:21.280 --> 05:24.158
was the intelligence behind it.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.410
The Darkasher
has no thoughts of its own.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.954
Only those of its master.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.998
They say...

05:31.040 --> 05:34.001
that sometimes its eyes
and its master's eyes

05:34.043 --> 05:35.711
can become as one and the same.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.173
Who here in the Burgue,

05:39.214 --> 05:41.884
besides yourself,
would have such knowledge?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.803
That, I cannot say.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.431
But to conjure the thing
that I saw

05:47.473 --> 05:50.350
would take skills
even beyond my own.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.109
Put it out of its misery.

06:09.244 --> 06:13.332
It cannot be killed,
not while you still breathe.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.794
Then put it in a jar.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.819
Am I interrupting?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.821
I'm looking over the loan, dear.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.823
I will need your signature

06:45.864 --> 06:48.492
to authorize the lien
on the house.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.791
What if I told you
I know someone

06:55.833 --> 06:59.002
who's interested in investing
in this venture of yours?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.549
My sweet sister,
I-I cannot tell you

07:03.590 --> 07:07.511
how much it warms me
you wish to support me in this.

07:07.553 --> 07:11.390
That said, I do not have time
to pursue idle chatter

07:11.431 --> 07:15.018
from Louisa Pembroke
or some such person

07:15.060 --> 07:16.520
that her second cousin
twice re...

07:16.562 --> 07:18.897
Oh, no, this is no idle chatter.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.649
This individual
has the wherewithal

07:20.691 --> 07:24.027
to fund the furbishment
of a ship in its entirety.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.156
Well, then, yes, I-I...

07:27.197 --> 07:30.325
I'd be very pleased
to make his acquaintance.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.246
What share of the profits
would he be after, I wonder?

07:34.288 --> 07:38.417
It is not a share
of the profits he seeks.

07:38.458 --> 07:43.463
Rather, acceptance
into our social circle.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.556
I speak, of course, of the Puck
across the street, Mr. Agreus.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.438
How would you know
how much money he has

07:59.479 --> 08:02.691
or how he would deign
to spend it?

08:02.733 --> 08:05.944
He took tea here the other day
while you were at the club.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.363
I... I beg your pardon?

08:08.405 --> 08:10.240
And he will be our guest
again this afternoon,

08:10.282 --> 08:11.885
along with the Pembrokes
and the Guilfoyles.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.995
Uh, that is impossible.
And it goes without saying...

08:15.037 --> 08:17.331
What is impossible, dear brother,

08:17.372 --> 08:19.708
is for you to secure
my signature on a document

08:19.750 --> 08:21.436
that endangers the very roof
over our heads...

08:21.460 --> 08:23.754
I will not negotiate
with my own fam...

08:23.795 --> 08:25.773
Not when there's another way
out of our predicament.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.550
One that will cost us nothing
save a measure of pride.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.136
It would be a scandal, Imogen.

08:31.178 --> 08:35.390
One the Spurnrose name has
the strength to endure.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.868
We would stand stronger
together, to be sure,

08:36.892 --> 08:38.684
but I will host the Puck alone
if I must.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.977
Oh, will you, now?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.981
In either way,
you will take his money.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.150
I won't let you
put this house at risk,

08:45.192 --> 08:48.237
not as long
as I still draw breath.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.451
Our guests are expected
at half past 3:00.

08:54.493 --> 08:57.287
I hope to see you here
to greet them.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.334
Imogen? Imogen!

09:18.934 --> 09:20.936
Good morning, Father. Mother.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.563
- Good morning, Jonah.
- Morning.

09:30.821 --> 09:34.783
Your father has something
he wants to say to you.

09:36.827 --> 09:40.539
Hmm. Indeed I do.

09:40.580 --> 09:45.544
As pleased as we are, of course,
to have you home again,

09:45.585 --> 09:47.713
we need to discuss
what happened.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.008
More than discuss.
There need to be consequences.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.052
Consequences?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.513
I was the victim here.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.658
- The boy makes a good point.
- But none of this would've happened

09:58.682 --> 10:02.644
if he'd done as you told him
and stayed off the Row.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.522
True, but let's not forget
that in the end,

10:05.564 --> 10:08.358
these unfortunate events
did expose

10:08.400 --> 10:10.027
Longerbane's treachery.

10:11.862 --> 10:15.574
It's time for Jonah
to put away childish things

10:15.615 --> 10:18.577
- and take hold of his future.
- Please, Mother, not the prophecy again.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.164
- Naked and covered with ash, I scaled Mount Carpe.
- Piety. Piety.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.583
On my hands and knees I climbed

10:24.624 --> 10:26.960
to consult the Augurs
before I married your father.

10:27.002 --> 10:31.256
And they told me
that he would be a great man

10:31.298 --> 10:32.841
and that his son
would be greater.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.052
Yes, yes, we know.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.989
If your father is chancellor,
just think

10:38.013 --> 10:39.639
what the fates
have in store for you.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.683
Maybe I'm to be crowned king.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.060
It's not impossible.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.329
Monarchies have been
restored before.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.146
Do you see now, Father?

10:46.188 --> 10:48.023
Do you see how,
no matter what I do,

10:48.065 --> 10:49.483
it will never be enough for her?

10:49.524 --> 10:51.485
Everything your mother
says and does,

10:51.526 --> 10:55.655
she does out of love for you,
that much I do know.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.532
How I wish I could believe that.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.409
Jonah.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.912
Apologize at once.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.831
I'm sorry, Mother.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.000
There. See?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.504
He's sorry.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.256
Your father and I have decided
that for the time being,

11:13.298 --> 11:15.592
you're to take a respite
from the public eye

11:15.634 --> 11:18.804
and stay home to concentrate
on your studies.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.598
Give the scandal
a chance to die down.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.809
Tongues will stop wagging
soon enough.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.852
And in the meantime,

11:25.894 --> 11:28.605
- by doubling your hours of tutelage...
- Doubling?

11:28.647 --> 11:30.232
...you may very well

11:30.273 --> 11:33.443
complete your course of study
by next Austery.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.737
Master Symes is waiting for you
in the library.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.537
Something to eat?

12:29.541 --> 12:31.001
Take it.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.836
It's freely given.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.008
Much obliged.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.801
Take one of these, too.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.887
The Cyphers. Do you know it?

12:41.928 --> 12:44.389
Me mum read me stories from it
when I was a bairn.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.892
Bless her. You might want to
read it for yourself, though.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.186
You might be surprised
by what you find.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.964
I don't believe this.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.383
"All fae, whether native born
or alien, are required

13:20.425 --> 13:22.385
to show papers upon request."

13:22.427 --> 13:24.971
- Since when?
- Since ten years at least.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.140
They can't be here,
not without papers.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.767
Well, they are here now.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.769
Well, they're gonna
have to go, then.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.687
- Where?
- Back where they came from.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.981
Knock?
It's been totally destroyed.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.691
- There's absolutely nothing left.
- Sir!

13:36.733 --> 13:39.236
"All fae, whether
native born or alien,

13:39.277 --> 13:42.906
- are required to show..."
- But what if they're not fae?

13:43.949 --> 13:45.408
What else would they be?

13:46.660 --> 13:47.911
Pets?

13:49.538 --> 13:50.997
But they're smart.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.166
They're not that smart.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.962
Truth be told,

13:57.003 --> 13:59.798
I can't recall whether kobolds
are specifically

13:59.839 --> 14:01.341
mentioned in the statute
or not.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.302
Oh, well, why don't you go
and check your statute,

14:04.344 --> 14:06.555
- and w-we'll just wait there.
- All right, all right.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.366
But you could be opening
yourself up to charges

14:08.390 --> 14:09.992
of transporting an animal
without a license.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.686
I'm prepared to pay any fine
that's required of me.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.981
Just have a seat there,
and keep 'em inside that box.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.357
Thank you so much, Officer.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.156
I think we're going to be

14:25.198 --> 14:27.867
absolutely fine.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.870
Ugh. Kobolds.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.999
I fucking knew it was
the wrong time to be away.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.876
And the missus wasn't too happy
to cut short our holiday

14:36.918 --> 14:39.254
on account of this fucking mess.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.047
Tell me you've made progress.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.800
The headmaster was killed
by the same hand as the fae

14:43.842 --> 14:46.553
that was found dead
off the Row the other day.

14:46.595 --> 14:49.222
How do you know
it was the same killer, then?

14:49.264 --> 14:51.266
Did that Puck
that you brought in

14:51.308 --> 14:53.351
to do her autopsy tell you that?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.437
- What Puck?
- A butcher from the Row.

14:55.478 --> 14:58.982
He was a physician in Puyan.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.358
Well, in that case...

15:00.400 --> 15:02.277
Took both their fucking livers.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.820
Proof enough for you?

15:05.030 --> 15:07.282
Their livers?

15:07.324 --> 15:08.867
W-Was it some kind
of trophy, maybe?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.578
Could be.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.872
All right, well,
keep me informed.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.290
Dombey, with me.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.564
Why didn't you tell him about
the Darkasher business?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.506
They wouldn't believe me
any more than you do.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.091
Anyway, it's not
the thing itself,

15:25.133 --> 15:27.469
but it's whoever's
controlling it that we want.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.888
Somebody wanted them both dead.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.245
Rycroft.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.206
Look at you.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.378
I still can't believe it.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.838
An inspector with
the constabulary.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.715
If only poor Master Finch
could've seen

16:05.757 --> 16:08.635
the man you've become,
he would've been so proud.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.261
Thank you, sir.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.806
Tell me, are you any closer
to apprehending

16:12.847 --> 16:14.391
whoever did this terrible thing?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.142
That's why I'm here.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.984
Did you ever see the headmaster
with this fae?

16:18.019 --> 16:20.647
Aisling Querelle.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.192
I've never seen her before, no.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.821
Any idea if he might have
known her?

16:27.862 --> 16:29.698
Who am I to say?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.785
His colleague and his friend.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.622
I've never seen her before.
I'm sorry.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.165
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:39.207 --> 16:41.835
I need to attend to several
pressing matters.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.713
Do feel free to have
a look about.

18:21.142 --> 18:24.229
I can fly. Look at me, Darius.
I can fly.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.985
I can fly, Darius.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.410
Are you all right, Philo?

20:17.342 --> 20:19.260
Everything must be perfect.

20:19.302 --> 20:22.388
Louisa Pembroke can sneer that
I invited a Puck all she wants,

20:22.430 --> 20:24.515
but the harken cake must be
above reproach.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.143
My harken cake is the best
in the Crossing,

20:27.185 --> 20:28.853
and you well know it.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.481
I'll miss me lots!

20:39.113 --> 20:40.949
Please, miss.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.286
- Vignette.
- Afissa.

20:45.328 --> 20:48.331
I'll take that for you
if you like.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.541
So you're running the lots now?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.126
They gave me
the Finistere route.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.547
You told me to find a life
for myself.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.466
I didn't mean the Black Raven.

20:58.508 --> 21:02.428
Those fae'll slit your throat
soon as look at you twice.

21:02.470 --> 21:06.599
I'll watch my back.
Don't you worry.

21:06.641 --> 21:10.812
Well, you're not one to suffer
any guff, I'll give you that.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.023
I'd better get back inside.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.276
Good luck to you, girl.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.195
Good luck to you, too.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.322
I'll win, one of these days.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.418
This way, please.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.461
Mr. and Miss Guilfoyle.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.338
Pierce, Hortensia, do come in.

21:37.380 --> 21:41.551
How long has it been?
Feels like ages.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.428
Be a good man, won't you,

21:43.469 --> 21:47.557
and fetch that straight-back
chair for these old bones.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.727
Mr. Agreus is not employed here.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.395
He is a guest.

21:56.941 --> 22:00.862
I'm very pleased to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Guilfoyle.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.198
And happy to oblige.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.868
This damp weather does no favors
for anyone's bones,

22:06.909 --> 22:09.829
old or young.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.289
Here you are.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.295
Most kind.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.176
Mr. Agreus is our new neighbor.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.970
He recently took ownership of
Cheswith House across the way.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.266
How extraordinary.

22:30.308 --> 22:33.394
It is an extraordinary property.
You're quite right.

22:33.436 --> 22:37.106
I was fortunate it came
on the market when it did.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.696
More guests?

22:43.738 --> 22:45.907
Louisa and Leonid Pembroke.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.909
Oh, thank the Martyr.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.495
Indeed.
The more, the merrier.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.957
Master and Miss Pembroke.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.131
Is it a game?

23:02.173 --> 23:04.842
Are we meant to dress up as help
and serve the servants?

23:08.054 --> 23:10.389
Mr. Agreus is not
an employee here.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.682
He's a guest.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.604
What a pleasure, Mr. Agreus.

23:16.646 --> 23:20.149
I'm Leonid Pembroke.
This is my sister, Louisa.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.860
Is that your Afissa's
harken cake?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.988
- I've been craving a slice all week.
- Yes. Oh, please sit.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.325
I would very much like
to hear your opinion

23:29.367 --> 23:31.577
on our city's recent troubles,
Mr. Agreus.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.121
She baked it special for you.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.915
I imagine you were
no more grieved than I was

23:35.957 --> 23:39.210
to hear of Ritter Longerbane's
well-deserved comeuppance.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.839
And why do you suppose
that would be?

23:42.880 --> 23:47.593
Oh, his antipathy to your kind,
beyond reason.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.513
Well, I have to wonder
whether the thousands

23:50.555 --> 23:52.390
that have lost their job
because my kind

23:52.431 --> 23:56.018
are willing to work for less
would agree.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.564
Well, s-surely
sacrifices have to be made

23:59.605 --> 24:02.567
in order to-to create
a more inclusive society.

24:04.235 --> 24:07.155
Have you ever been to Puyan,
Mr. Pembroke?

24:07.196 --> 24:10.449
I should think not.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.704
I mean, you could go
months there

24:14.745 --> 24:17.623
without encountering anyone
that wasn't a Puck.

24:17.665 --> 24:20.626
Not a Trow or a Pix in sight,
much less a man.

24:20.668 --> 24:23.087
And I can assure you
that no one there

24:23.129 --> 24:25.006
gives even the slightest thought

24:25.047 --> 24:29.010
towards creating a more...
inclusive society.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.929
Well, it's not as if anyone
would care to live there.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.934
Not since the war, in any event.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.939
I know I don't.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.359
Which is how I find myself here,

24:45.401 --> 24:49.405
in such fine company.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.716
Harken cake, anyone?

26:05.064 --> 26:07.775
...and may bathe forever
in your light,

26:07.817 --> 26:09.360
O blessed Martyr.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.029
Very good, Rycroft.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.241
Now, ask the Martyr
to protect your secret,

26:15.283 --> 26:18.327
to hide the truth of
the fae blood in your veins.

26:18.369 --> 26:22.123
I will, sir. I'll pray.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.639
Master Thorne.

26:38.681 --> 26:40.391
You're still here.

26:40.433 --> 26:43.352
I was just remembering
something you taught me.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.563
Oh?

26:45.604 --> 26:48.024
That sins of omission
are far more dangerous

26:48.065 --> 26:49.734
than sins of commission.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.569
Because they're easier
to get away with.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.654
What made you think of that?

26:53.696 --> 26:56.532
I can't help feeling
there's something

26:56.574 --> 27:00.244
you haven't been
entirely truthful about.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.204
You think I've lied to you?

27:02.246 --> 27:04.749
I think you've chosen
not to tell me something.

27:06.584 --> 27:10.046
A sin of omission, as you say.

27:10.087 --> 27:13.007
Easy enough to get away with.

27:13.049 --> 27:16.093
Just tell me I'm wrong,
and I'll be on my way.

27:18.971 --> 27:23.601
Today would've been
Costin's night off.

27:23.642 --> 27:27.521
After the boys had suppered
and he'd led last prayers,

27:27.563 --> 27:29.357
he would've dressed his best,

27:29.398 --> 27:32.526
like he did every Gullsday
for as long as I knew him,

27:32.568 --> 27:35.112
and taken a carriage to the Row.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.240
The Row?

27:38.282 --> 27:42.328
I've never known a finer man
than Costin Finch,

27:42.370 --> 27:45.373
but he did succumb
to the appetites of the flesh.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.918
You saying...

27:48.959 --> 27:52.546
He frequented a certain
house of ill repute

27:52.588 --> 27:54.173
well-known for providing...

27:54.215 --> 27:57.802
fae companionship.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.431
It's repellent
to contemplate, I know,

28:02.473 --> 28:04.475
but there you have it.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.658
Thank you for being forthcoming.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.119
It could mean everything
to this case.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.504
Is there a reason
you had to make this harder

28:33.546 --> 28:35.506
than it already is?

28:35.548 --> 28:37.133
He was only trying to be polite.

28:37.174 --> 28:40.386
I won't be condescended to.

28:43.097 --> 28:46.016
What could've
possibly got into her?

28:46.058 --> 28:49.895
She's always been
a bit off, hasn't she?

28:53.315 --> 28:55.776
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.862
I thought I could weather
their disapproval,

28:57.903 --> 29:00.531
but I see now
I haven't the strength.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.075
- We had an agreement.
- Please,

29:03.117 --> 29:07.621
make your excuses and go.

29:07.663 --> 29:11.333
And what will you tell them?

29:11.375 --> 29:14.336
That it was just a game
after all?

29:14.378 --> 29:15.880
A joke?

29:21.218 --> 29:23.429
I have clearly failed to uphold

29:23.471 --> 29:26.223
my end of the bargain.

29:26.265 --> 29:30.728
I understand that I cannot
expect you to uphold yours.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.981
I should've known you wouldn't
have the mettle for this.

29:36.567 --> 29:40.321
I am more than happy
to return you to poverty.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.247
Miss Imogen.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.625
Ah.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.294
I am so sorry I'm late.

29:55.336 --> 29:58.339
I was held up
with my solicitors.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.799
Mr. Agreus,

30:00.841 --> 30:03.385
pleasure to meet you again.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.767
Welcome to our home.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.978
Please take a seat.

30:29.245 --> 30:31.455
If you're to complete your
course of study by Austery,

30:31.497 --> 30:34.041
you'll need tutors
in every field of knowledge.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.168
- Lucky me.
- What's that?

30:36.210 --> 30:38.629
- I said I'll leave that to you.
- Quite so.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.173
In the meantime, the best way
to learn about politics

30:41.215 --> 30:43.551
is to witness it for yourself.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.470
And there's no greater
practitioner than your father.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.447
Who's that?

31:05.489 --> 31:07.658
Longerbane's daughter, Sophie.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.076
As his sole living heir,

31:09.118 --> 31:10.953
she'll fill his seat
until the next election.

31:10.995 --> 31:12.746
It's just a formality, really.

31:12.788 --> 31:15.541
She'll take her oath,
mouth some platitudes,

31:15.583 --> 31:17.626
and that'll likely be
the last we see of her.

31:29.013 --> 31:32.850
Gentlemen and gentle ladies
of Parliament,

31:32.891 --> 31:35.728
I stand before you brokenhearted

31:35.769 --> 31:38.731
by the loss of my father.

31:38.772 --> 31:41.191
He was a great man,

31:41.233 --> 31:43.360
and I will endeavor
to make him proud.

31:49.408 --> 31:53.996
Dear girl,
I am sure that, like myself,

31:54.038 --> 31:57.958
you are eager to put
behind us the rancor

31:58.000 --> 32:01.128
that has led us
to this juncture.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.172
Thank you for your words.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.882
Now, if I may,

32:04.923 --> 32:07.593
I'd like to turn my fellow
proctors' attention to...

32:07.635 --> 32:10.220
I wasn't finished, Chancellor.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.769
By all means.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.395
Continue.

32:21.649 --> 32:23.025
It is not only

32:23.067 --> 32:25.986
my father's memory
I wish to honor,

32:26.028 --> 32:28.656
but my mother's, too.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.241
Her desert blood
was written on her face

32:31.283 --> 32:34.870
surely as it is written on mine.

32:34.912 --> 32:39.667
Her forefathers fled the chaos
of war in the Pharaonic Coast

32:39.708 --> 32:41.835
and came to these shores,

32:41.877 --> 32:44.421
where the color of their skin

32:44.463 --> 32:47.758
made them outcasts.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.553
But, like so many others,

32:51.595 --> 32:54.306
they overcame the prejudices
of that time

32:54.348 --> 32:59.561
and found a place
in this great city.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.940
And that speaks well
of the Burgue and its values.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.406
Today,

33:10.447 --> 33:14.118
the chaos of war
in the lands of the fae

33:14.159 --> 33:17.955
has brought a new wave
of refugees to these shores.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.709
And they, too,
are seen as outcasts.

33:23.836 --> 33:27.005
It is right to ask

33:27.047 --> 33:29.591
if our suspicions
of these newcomers

33:29.633 --> 33:34.179
will one day be seen as
a benighted vestige of the past.

33:34.221 --> 33:38.434
It is right to ask
if we can overcome

33:38.475 --> 33:40.894
the differences
between us and the fae

33:40.936 --> 33:42.396
that rear our children,

33:42.438 --> 33:46.316
plow our fields,
work our factories.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.402
Hear, hear.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.154
Hear, hear.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.865
By the Martyr,
she's turning on her own father.

33:52.906 --> 33:56.827
I stand before you
with my answer.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.959
We cannot.

34:06.170 --> 34:09.422
The fae are

34:09.465 --> 34:12.760
nothing like us.

34:12.801 --> 34:17.389
Our differences
are more than skin deep,

34:17.431 --> 34:19.933
and our chancellor

34:19.975 --> 34:22.811
has turned a blind eye

34:22.853 --> 34:25.022
for far too long,

34:25.063 --> 34:27.900
but I will not.

34:27.940 --> 34:32.446
A great tide of anger
is rising in this city.

34:32.487 --> 34:36.033
Its good people have had enough!

34:36.074 --> 34:37.659
Yes! Yes!

34:37.701 --> 34:41.038
And I, Sophie Longerbane,

34:41.079 --> 34:44.208
stand with them.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.210
Who will stand with me?

34:59.223 --> 35:01.308
Longerbane! Longerbane!

35:01.350 --> 35:03.227
Longerbane!

35:04.478 --> 35:07.064
By the Martyr,

35:07.105 --> 35:11.068
she's the most magnificent
creature I've ever laid eyes on.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.863
Ah, thank you.

35:22.538 --> 35:25.082
I think I got this right.
Have a look.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.125
Hmm?

35:29.127 --> 35:31.088
Yeah, that looks right to me.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.715
Last three digits
are six, eight, nine.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.676
That's the number, then.

35:35.717 --> 35:39.012
Let's see
if I've got any winners.

35:41.056 --> 35:44.268
Sun's down. It's showtime.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.187
She's still here?

35:47.229 --> 35:50.691
Just till she gets
back on her feet.

35:50.732 --> 35:54.361
She doesn't have much meat
on her bones, does she?

35:54.403 --> 35:57.072
Well, some men like that,
I suppose.

35:57.114 --> 36:00.576
Oh, she's-she's not looking
for a job here.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.661
Please.

36:02.703 --> 36:04.121
All right, she can stay.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.416
For a bit.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.918
As long as she doesn't get in
the way of business, Tourmaline.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.128
Fair enough.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.630
- Thank you, Moira.
- Thank you.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.845
Any winners?

36:19.887 --> 36:23.056
Mm, not today.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.934
Okay. Come on, then.

36:25.976 --> 36:28.186
Go away. Girl's got to work.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.897
Right.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.357
I'll go deliver the skim.
Kill some time.

36:32.399 --> 36:34.359
Maybe come back around 2:00
with some food?

36:34.401 --> 36:36.486
Mm. Perfect.

36:47.080 --> 36:51.126
I suppose I should try not
to get too used to this.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.769
What are you doing here?

37:09.811 --> 37:11.021
Don't worry.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.522
- It's police business.
- Right.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.901
- I've got to work, too.
- Be careful.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.611
Like you give a shit.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.786
How can I help?

37:27.537 --> 37:29.373
This man was a client here.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.709
You're a copper.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.420
I need to speak
to his regular girl.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.548
My clients expect
confidentiality.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.926
Not this one. He's dead.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.471
Costin's dead?

37:44.513 --> 37:47.349
Murder.

37:47.391 --> 37:48.767
Who was his girl?

37:50.811 --> 37:54.106
It's a little more
complicated than that.

37:54.147 --> 37:57.025
Come on.

37:57.067 --> 38:00.445
For as long as I can remember,

38:00.487 --> 38:03.573
Costin would book
a room with two girls

38:03.615 --> 38:06.034
each Gullsday night.

38:06.076 --> 38:08.453
The bed would be put to work.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.415
The girls weren't.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.250
Go on.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.212
He preferred people thinking
he had a taste for Pix whores

38:17.254 --> 38:20.716
to them knowing the truth.

38:20.757 --> 38:24.845
That he was meeting
with another man's woman?

38:24.886 --> 38:27.097
That he was meeting...

38:27.139 --> 38:29.141
with another man.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.563
You must think it foolish of me,

38:34.604 --> 38:37.024
coming to an empty room
to say goodbye.

38:37.065 --> 38:40.861
This was the only place
we could ever feel safe.

38:42.404 --> 38:45.282
We stood over his body together.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.617
You gave nothing away.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.539
When you've lived with a secret
as long as I have,

38:52.581 --> 38:54.750
you'd be amazed
what you can hide.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.589
Still, there's always the shame.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.133
Fear of being discovered.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.762
It's strange.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.680
We only had one night a week

39:08.722 --> 39:11.016
when we could be
who we truly were.

39:11.058 --> 39:15.228
So little time
in the scheme of things,

39:15.270 --> 39:19.441
yet somehow it's the rest
of it that...

39:19.483 --> 39:21.818
Feels like a lie.

39:23.570 --> 39:24.780
Yes.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.870
There's something I should've
told you the other day

39:31.912 --> 39:34.915
when we were in the morgue.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.583
Costin knew Aisling.

39:38.835 --> 39:43.131
They met a long time ago,
before he took his vows.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.925
They were close then.

39:44.966 --> 39:48.303
He must've seen her perform
a dozen times.

39:48.345 --> 39:49.763
Hmm.

39:51.681 --> 39:53.934
So the murders
are connected somehow.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.769
So it would seem.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.021
It's hard to see how.

39:58.063 --> 40:02.275
They hadn't spoken in 20 years,
at least as far as I'm aware.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.160
Thank you, Doctor.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.454
And know this...

40:14.496 --> 40:17.040
your secret's safe with me.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.708
Maybe it's time
I stopped hiding.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.712
Time will tell
if I've the courage.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.146
Fucking Critch.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.106
Piece of shite.

41:12.012 --> 41:15.932
I read it. Front to back.

41:15.974 --> 41:19.060
Tell me,
I want to know everything.

41:26.902 --> 41:29.487
Uh... Well, excuse me.

41:29.529 --> 41:32.157
Excuse me!

41:32.199 --> 41:35.076
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, where are my kobolds?

41:35.118 --> 41:36.536
Kobolds?

41:36.578 --> 41:38.955
Yeah, they were in a case
on the bench.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.248
Where are they?

41:40.290 --> 41:42.417
Right.

41:42.459 --> 41:44.961
- Packed them off already.
- Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.464
The constable was just going
to check their status.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.382
That was all.

41:49.424 --> 41:52.302
All I know is there was
a deportation order.

41:52.344 --> 41:54.512
- What?
- Here, somewhere.

41:54.554 --> 41:57.182
Yeah, here it is. Right.

41:57.224 --> 41:59.017
See?

41:59.059 --> 42:01.478
Hang on a minute. You're right.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.563
"Order pending status check."

42:03.605 --> 42:06.691
- Didn't see that bit.
- Yeah, so where are they?

42:06.733 --> 42:08.568
Packed them off, like I said.
To the docks.

42:08.610 --> 42:12.072
- To the docks?
- For deportation.

42:12.113 --> 42:15.367
Ship bound to... Ignota.

42:15.408 --> 42:17.410
Would've left by now,
I should think.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.663
So what's it called?

42:19.704 --> 42:21.164
- What?
- The ship.

42:21.206 --> 42:24.417
- What's its name?
- Get your hands off me!

42:24.459 --> 42:28.004
Tell me what its name is.
What's its name?!

42:42.102 --> 42:44.104
Janus.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.482
The Janus, where's she docked?

42:47.524 --> 42:49.109
- The Janus?
- Janus?

42:49.150 --> 42:51.152
- The boat. The ship.
- Oh, the ship.

42:51.194 --> 42:53.905
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sh-she, uh... she set sail a few minutes ago.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.323
- What?
- Yeah.

42:55.365 --> 42:56.825
It's gone.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.160
No!

43:00.412 --> 43:02.789
No!

43:02.831 --> 43:05.625
Oh, no!

43:27.731 --> 43:30.734
It's blood money.
That's what it is.

43:32.986 --> 43:35.155
No one's died.

43:35.196 --> 43:37.365
If we managed to muddle through
this afternoon,

43:37.407 --> 43:41.786
it's only because our guests
were too polite to do otherwise.

43:41.828 --> 43:44.164
And to think,

43:44.205 --> 43:48.209
the story of the Puck who came
to tea at the Spurnroses'

43:48.251 --> 43:51.087
is spreading like poison
even now.

43:53.089 --> 43:57.761
We can weather this
if we stand together.

43:57.802 --> 44:02.349
Well, he will want more
than an invitation for tea

44:02.390 --> 44:04.392
for this amount.

44:08.104 --> 44:10.315
Naturally.

44:10.357 --> 44:12.067
I'll need to be seen
with him in public,

44:12.108 --> 44:13.777
on several occasions at least.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.612
And where does it end?

44:17.405 --> 44:19.657
When someone else extends him
a proper invitation,

44:19.699 --> 44:21.618
I suppose.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.912
Now, thank the Martyr,

44:23.953 --> 44:27.332
Father is not here
to see how low we've sunk.

44:30.752 --> 44:32.504
If Father were here,
none of this

44:32.545 --> 44:34.506
would be necessary, would it?

44:37.634 --> 44:40.637
I'm going to bed. Good night.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.555
Good night.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.015
Ezra?

44:45.475 --> 44:47.477
Yes?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.689
Thank you.

45:28.351 --> 45:30.019
Good girl.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.355
Good girl, Giddy.

46:52.519 --> 46:54.312
What time is it?

47:01.152 --> 47:03.780
God's noose, I fell asleep.

47:16.543 --> 47:18.586
Good night.

47:31.933 --> 47:35.979
She was a singer
back in the day.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.982
She had a voice.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.025
Haunting.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.529
Can't get it out of my head.

48:57.769 --> 48:59.771
Giddy?

49:01.648 --> 49:03.650
Giddy.

49:05.693 --> 49:07.695
Giddy.

49:13.868 --> 49:15.870
Giddy.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.255
Giddy?
