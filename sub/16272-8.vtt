<i>[chanting] Butt! Butt! Butt!
[laughs]</i>

00:02.057 --> 00:04.006
Headbutt Man, you are the man!

00:04.042 --> 00:05.742
[exclaims]
[cheering]

00:05.777 --> 00:08.144
Hell yeah!
I feel amazing!

00:08.179 --> 00:10.913
There's nothing...
literally nothing...

00:10.949 --> 00:13.750
I can't smash with my head!

00:13.785 --> 00:15.451
Oh, hey, Butt,
what about a unicorn?

00:15.487 --> 00:18.554
Oh, yeah! Let's take this
party to the next level!

00:18.623 --> 00:21.891
<i>Someone bring me a bucket
of tequila and a unicorn! [chuckles] </i>

00:21.926 --> 00:24.827
- Oh, man.
- LINDA: Listen up, people.

00:24.863 --> 00:27.664
We just closed
the Tustin Soccer Land account.

00:27.699 --> 00:31.599
- Tonight we celebrate at Milligan's.
- Oh, hey, Linda, is it cool

00:31.634 --> 00:33.870
if I bring my buddy Headbutt Man,
Wrecker of Skulls,

00:33.905 --> 00:36.205
Smasher of Art,
Destroyer of Bars and Restaurants?

00:36.241 --> 00:38.241
<i>He's my old war
buddy from Zephyria,</i>

00:38.276 --> 00:39.976
<i>and he's coming
to visit me this weekend.</i>

00:40.011 --> 00:42.045
I mean, he can drink
a battlemammoth under the table,

00:42.080 --> 00:44.847
and then he headbutts everything.

00:44.883 --> 00:47.016
Oh, that sounds like
a terrible idea.

00:47.085 --> 00:49.852
But at Milligan's,
I'm not Boss Linda.

00:49.888 --> 00:51.654
I'm Slayer Linda!

00:51.690 --> 00:53.656
And Slayer Linda's
a little more pro-destruction.

00:53.692 --> 00:57.060
Slayer Linda makes me...
uncomfortable.

00:57.095 --> 00:59.295
- Yeah, you told HR.
- Oh! [laughs]

00:59.330 --> 01:00.997
[crowd chanting over phone]
Check out

01:01.032 --> 01:03.166
what Butt did to the world's
largest domino display.

01:03.201 --> 01:04.167
[Headbutt Man yells, crash]

01:04.202 --> 01:06.536
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!

01:06.571 --> 01:08.037
[whoops]

01:08.073 --> 01:09.972
[laughs]

01:10.008 --> 01:10.707
Todd, look!

[school bell ringing]

01:18.283 --> 01:20.550
- Oh, hey, Layla.
- Hey.

01:20.585 --> 01:22.385
- What's up?
- Uh, did you hear about

01:22.420 --> 01:24.220
- Shannon's party?
- Yeah.

01:24.255 --> 01:26.289
I'm actually kind of torn,
'cause, on the one hand,

01:26.324 --> 01:27.824
- Shannon's, like, the worst.
- Yeah.

01:27.859 --> 01:30.393
But on the other hand,
I hate parties, so...

01:30.428 --> 01:33.796
Right.
You want to go?

01:33.832 --> 01:36.500
- To the party?
- Yeah. Or we could just

01:36.501 --> 01:40.236
go and be stupid
and wear our pants backwards.

01:40.271 --> 01:43.172
Yeah, yeah, I mean, we could...
we could try to get in,

01:43.208 --> 01:45.374
but I don't know
if they let in freaks.

01:45.410 --> 01:48.745
- Freaks?
- Yeah, you know, like you and me.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.447
Oh, yeah. [laughs]
Yeah, we're totally freaks.

01:51.483 --> 01:53.149
Anyway, I should probably go.

01:53.184 --> 01:56.285
- But, uh, maybe I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

01:56.321 --> 01:58.855
Yeah, I'll see you there, freak!

02:00.725 --> 02:02.458
[school bell ringing]

02:02.494 --> 02:03.993
<i>ZORN [laughs]:
All right, here we go.</i>

02:04.028 --> 02:07.671
Flight tracker says
Headbutt Man landed 20 minutes ago.

02:07.735 --> 02:09.499
[chanting]
Butt! Butt! Butt! Butt!

02:09.533 --> 02:10.767
Wh-Why aren't
you guys chanting?

02:10.801 --> 02:13.970
Uh, maybe because you just told
us he was coming three hours ago.

02:14.038 --> 02:16.205
- And staying with you.
- That's right. Yes, thank you.

02:16.241 --> 02:17.940
Well, I-I can't
let him stay with me.

02:17.976 --> 02:20.109
No, he'd destroy the place.
And I rent.

02:20.145 --> 02:21.944
So, is this protected enough?

02:21.980 --> 02:24.580
- Uh, you tell me. [grunts]
- Oh...

02:24.616 --> 02:25.847
- Really?
- Remember back in Zephyria,

02:25.850 --> 02:28.284
when he headbutted
that giant hole in the ground,

02:28.319 --> 02:30.820
and then we all got wasted and
started dropping elves into the hole?

02:30.855 --> 02:33.122
Yes, I remember
committing elficide.

02:33.158 --> 02:36.559
Oh, man, I can't wait to go
berserk with Butt at my work party.

02:36.594 --> 02:37.860
Hey, you know what,

02:37.896 --> 02:39.762
you guys should come rage
with us, too, you know.

02:39.798 --> 02:43.332
- Craig and I are not raging.
- No. We're gonna stay in, relax,

02:43.368 --> 02:45.268
maybe open one of
our cheeses of the month.

02:45.303 --> 02:47.970
- Mmm.
- Ugh! This is exactly why I can't wait

02:48.006 --> 02:49.572
for Headbutt Man to get here.

02:49.607 --> 02:51.574
This has been my life
since I got to Orange County:

02:51.609 --> 02:54.243
dinner parties,
bike rides, avocado toast,

02:54.279 --> 02:57.814
- uh, the dumb happy look on Craig's face.
- Oh.

02:57.849 --> 02:59.415
The dumb hurt look
on Craig's face.

02:59.450 --> 03:03.329
- I am bored out of my friggin' mind!
- I'm so sorry

03:03.364 --> 03:05.254
that you feel like
your best days are behind you,

03:05.290 --> 03:08.991
- but I love it here, and I never look back.
- Well, if young Edie

03:09.027 --> 03:10.660
could hear you say that,
she would stomp you

03:10.695 --> 03:13.095
with her awesome
giant demon boots.

03:13.131 --> 03:13.996
It's called growing up.

03:14.032 --> 03:15.932
Maybe if Headbutt Man
had done it,

03:15.967 --> 03:17.767
he'd still be married
to Headbutt Woman.

03:17.802 --> 03:19.602
Aw, come on,
why you got to rag on Butt?

03:19.637 --> 03:22.805
- What'd he ever do to you?
- He headbutted me.

03:22.841 --> 03:26.042
Well, I for one am looking
forward to meeting this gentleman.

03:26.077 --> 03:27.777
Oh, boy.

03:27.812 --> 03:30.213
Layla. Yeah, yeah,
it's you, uh-huh.

03:30.248 --> 03:32.748
Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Just keep-keep at it.

03:32.784 --> 03:34.050
I'll be...

03:34.085 --> 03:37.620
Dumbass.
Stupid tight jeans.

03:41.526 --> 03:44.827
Mm. What a freak.
[doorbell rings]

03:44.863 --> 03:46.295
<i>ZORN: Oh, he's here!
He's here!</i>

03:46.331 --> 03:48.631

[both laughing]
Aw, it's good to see you.

03:52.503 --> 03:54.937
- Oh, man.  - Oh, is that Glombeast
blood on your shirt there?

03:54.973 --> 03:56.606
Wh... Oh!
[laughs]

03:56.641 --> 03:58.608
- Got you!
- Oh, man, you got me.

03:58.643 --> 03:59.976
But really, is that blood?

04:00.011 --> 04:01.244
- Never mind.
- Who is that I see?

04:01.279 --> 04:03.212
- Is that Edie?
- Hey, Butt.

04:03.248 --> 04:05.314
Boy, oh, boy, you look mature.

04:05.350 --> 04:06.716
- Oh.
- Uh, in a, in a good way.

04:06.751 --> 04:08.284
You know, without
the dread-mohawk

04:08.319 --> 04:10.419
- and all the face piercings.
- Well, it's still

04:10.455 --> 04:12.655
my driver's license photo, so...
[laughs]

04:12.690 --> 04:14.156
Uh, this is Craig, my fiancÃ©.

04:14.192 --> 04:16.791
Hi. As you can see,
I sort of came prepared.

04:16.827 --> 04:18.961
- I want your butt right on my head.
- Oh...

04:18.997 --> 04:20.463
<i>CRAIG: That didn't
sound right. I'm sorry.</i>

04:20.498 --> 04:22.365
<i>ZORN: Aw, Butt, no, come
on, you shouldn't have.</i>

04:22.400 --> 04:25.301
You know, I didn't think they still
sold comfort slaves at Duty Free.

04:25.336 --> 04:28.004
- Kneel, wench!
- [chuckles] No, no, Zorn.

04:28.039 --> 04:31.007
- This is my girlfriend, Elizabeth.
- Your girlfriend?

04:31.042 --> 04:33.676
- Head's told me so much about you.
- "Head?"

04:33.711 --> 04:35.544
- You must be Edie.
- Hi.

04:35.580 --> 04:38.814
- Do I... Have we met?
- I don't think so.

04:38.850 --> 04:40.683
- Maybe in Zephyria?
- Oh.

04:40.718 --> 04:42.618
Did you used to have a spider
that lived in your face?

04:42.654 --> 04:45.288
- No, sorry.
- Well, let me show you guys

04:45.323 --> 04:46.188
where you're gonna be.
Oh, my God!

04:46.224 --> 04:47.189
What?

04:47.225 --> 04:49.558
HEADBUTT MAN: Headbutt Girl, come on!
You don't just

04:49.594 --> 04:52.361
enter someone's house and
stand there all creepily.

04:52.397 --> 04:53.729
Oh, sorry. Hi.

04:53.765 --> 04:56.532
Um... my mom and brother
are both dead.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.333
- [chuckles] It's...
- Hey, there he is!

04:58.368 --> 05:00.503
- Yo.
- The fruit of my loins.

05:00.538 --> 05:03.272
He's got his mother's eyes,
but his father's penises.

05:03.308 --> 05:05.041
What? Okay.
[chuckles]

05:05.076 --> 05:07.076
All right, on that note,
I'm probably gonna head out.

05:07.111 --> 05:08.544
- Where?
- Oh, to that party.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.112
Uh, you said you'd let me
borrow the car, remember?

05:10.148 --> 05:11.314
HEADBUTT MAN: A party? Oh, wow!

05:11.349 --> 05:12.648
That sounds like something
Headbutt Girl would be

05:12.684 --> 05:14.350
totally interested in.
Hey, you know what,

05:14.385 --> 05:16.018
maybe you guys could go
together or something like that.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.520
I don't know, I'm just
throwing the idea out there.

05:17.555 --> 05:19.288
Oh, you know what, actually,
really, it's more of a...

05:19.324 --> 05:23.392
Yes, that is a great idea.
You should bring her along.

05:23.428 --> 05:24.427
[grunts, chuckles]

05:24.462 --> 05:26.595
She is our guest.
[sighs]

05:26.631 --> 05:29.532
- Okay. Shall we?
- All right.

05:29.567 --> 05:32.368
Okay, so, uh, Headbutt Girl,
where would...

05:32.403 --> 05:33.936
Headbutt Girl?
[scoffs]

05:33.972 --> 05:36.639
What are you, my dad?
Okay, no one calls me that.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.240
Call me Dorothy Clementina.

05:38.276 --> 05:41.243
- Okay, uh, Dorothy, the...
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I just say Dorothy,

05:41.279 --> 05:43.579
or did I say Dorothy Clementina?!

05:43.614 --> 05:45.948
Use both names together
so it sounds more badass.

05:45.984 --> 05:49.919
I'm sorry. Uh, okay.
So... I just want to make sure

05:49.954 --> 05:52.288
you're prepared to go to,
like, an American party.

05:52.357 --> 05:55.358
Is there gonna be sex at the party?
'Cause I'm good at sex.

05:55.393 --> 05:56.793
You know what? I think there's probably

05:56.794 --> 05:58.194
some better stuff we could do tonight.

05:58.229 --> 05:59.996
This party is pretty stupid.

06:00.031 --> 06:03.532
We're going to that party!
Start the car! [growls]

06:03.568 --> 06:06.068
- What do you think about an accent wall?
- Oh, I like that.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.737
- Do you?
- ZORN [quietly]: Hey, don't worry.

06:07.772 --> 06:09.438
Five minutes of small talk
and we can split.

06:09.474 --> 06:11.340
My office is having
a bananas-ass throw-down.

06:11.376 --> 06:12.575
And then after the party,

06:12.610 --> 06:15.111
<i>I know this guy who has an
illegal bull on his ranch.</i>

06:15.146 --> 06:17.146
I'd love to see what you can do
against that thing.

06:17.181 --> 06:18.948
[chuckles]
Yeah, sure, no, that's, uh...

06:18.983 --> 06:21.283
Why don't we just see
how the night plays out?

06:21.319 --> 06:22.651
- Is that Nababbo?
- Oh, my God.

06:22.687 --> 06:24.286
You're familiar with
the Nina Simone of goat's milks?

06:24.322 --> 06:26.489
Well, is this, like,
a cheese tasting, or...

06:26.524 --> 06:28.357
- Oh, well, it can be.
- [chuckles]: Yeah.

06:28.426 --> 06:30.526
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No,
you guys go ahead and stay here.

06:30.561 --> 06:33.396
Sniff dairy, stack crackers,
be generally very boring.

06:33.431 --> 06:36.499
Really? I don't know, I...
cheese night sounds kind of fun.

06:36.534 --> 06:37.933
- Fun?
- CRAIG: You know what,

06:37.969 --> 06:39.602
we could have
a cheese/wine pairing.

06:39.637 --> 06:42.972
- EDIE: Ooh!
- Uh, actually, uh, no wine for me.

06:43.007 --> 06:44.673
[chuckles]:
Oh, wait a minute, now I get it.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.142
"Cheese night."
"No wine for me."

06:46.177 --> 06:48.444
[chuckles]
Aw, I totally fell for it, man.

06:48.479 --> 06:49.779
That's hilarious.
[chuckles]

06:49.814 --> 06:52.815
Actually, Zorn, I, um...
I don't party anymore.

06:52.850 --> 06:56.685
- [clears throat] I-I quit.
- EDIE: Well, that is great news.

06:56.721 --> 06:57.720
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

06:57.755 --> 06:59.355
Hold on! [laughs]

06:59.390 --> 07:01.257
Look at those crackers!
[laughs]

07:01.292 --> 07:02.859
<i>- CRAIG: Thank you.
- HEADBUTT MAN: Wow! [tense music]</i>

07:02.894 --> 07:04.627
<i>You know how
to make a guy's mouth water.</i>

07:04.662 --> 07:06.429
<i>Am I right or am I right
or am I right?</i>

07:06.464 --> 07:08.464
[chatter, laughter continues]

07:08.499 --> 07:10.958
You must have crackers
from all over the world!

07:12.543 --> 07:15.377
EDIE: Well, how did you two meet?

07:15.412 --> 07:18.747
Oh, well, I was working
as a nurse in Zephyria

07:18.782 --> 07:20.382
<i>- Mhm.
- through Doctors Without Borders.</i>

07:20.417 --> 07:21.817
And they just opened up
that coffee spot

07:21.852 --> 07:23.600
down the street
from Butt Palace.

07:23.635 --> 07:25.620
ELIZABETH: So I was on a
little latte break, and...

07:25.656 --> 07:27.422
- they mixed up our orders.
- And they mixed up our orders!

07:27.458 --> 07:29.024
- Are you kidding me?
- EDIE: Oh, wait a sec.

07:29.059 --> 07:30.459
You were a nurse?
That must be it.

07:30.494 --> 07:33.762
Were you working triage
during the bloodbath of '92?

07:33.797 --> 07:36.364
No. I was zombified and buried
underground for all of '92.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.899
- Oh.
- Anyway,

07:37.935 --> 07:39.734
turns out Head and I
have so much in common.

07:39.770 --> 07:42.037
- Ugh.
- We both really like visiting canals.

07:42.072 --> 07:44.106
Well, Elizabeth got me into it.

07:44.141 --> 07:45.173
That's what we're doing
in town, actually.

07:45.209 --> 07:46.308
We're gonna visit the Venice Canals.

07:46.343 --> 07:48.343
- Oh, boy.
- HEADBUTT MAN: Oh, we've seen

07:48.378 --> 07:52.013
all the greats: Dane's Canal,
Old Sussex Canal, Carnhar's Canal.

07:52.049 --> 07:53.882
<i>ZORN: Yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure. Names of canals,</i>

07:53.917 --> 07:55.217
other canal names, right, okay.

07:55.252 --> 07:56.685
Hey, Butt, remember
when you got wasted

07:56.720 --> 07:59.605
and head-slammed that wild boar?
[Zorn and Headbutt Man laugh]

07:59.623 --> 08:01.356
Do I?
Then I followed that boar home

08:01.391 --> 08:03.191
- and murdered its whole family.
- Oh, that's right.

08:03.227 --> 08:04.726
[Zorn and Headbutt Man laugh]

08:04.761 --> 08:06.995
But we should probably...
[clears throat]

08:07.030 --> 08:09.798
not dwell on the past, you know?
[clears throat]

08:09.833 --> 08:12.734
- I couldn't agree more.
- CRAIG: Well, let's have a toast.

08:12.769 --> 08:14.169
- To new friends and old.
- Yes.

08:14.204 --> 08:16.304
[glasses clinking, laughter]

08:16.340 --> 08:17.472
[gasping]

08:17.508 --> 08:19.541
- I'm out of here!
- My crackers!

08:19.576 --> 08:22.911
<i>Sorry about the crackers!
Please clean them up for me.</i>

08:22.946 --> 08:24.312
<i>ZORN: Come on, Star Sprinkle,

08:24.348 --> 08:25.714
<i>[laughs]:
There you go.</i>

08:25.749 --> 08:27.516
<i>Oh, it's gonna be
the best butt ever.</i>

08:27.551 --> 08:30.452
<i>Headbutting a unicorn?
It just makes sense, right? [laughs]</i>

08:30.487 --> 08:32.254
<i>- Let me at it!
- [chanting] Butt! Butt! Butt!</i>

08:32.289 --> 08:34.856
<i>HEADBUTT MAN [over video]:
That unicorn's toast!</i>

08:34.892 --> 08:36.892
Hey. Oh, wow, glorp.

08:36.927 --> 08:39.327
[chuckles] I didn't know
you were still glorping.

08:39.363 --> 08:42.130
Yeah, yeah. Hey, remember
how we used to cut it

08:42.166 --> 08:43.798
with the ground-up teeth
of those we vanquished?

08:43.833 --> 08:45.167
I sure do.

08:45.202 --> 08:46.835
Yeah, I brought some
for old time's sake,

08:46.870 --> 08:48.837
but I'm guessing
you don't want any?

08:48.872 --> 08:51.706
Yeah. Elizabeth
doesn't really approve.

08:51.742 --> 08:53.708
You know, mouth cancer and all.

08:53.744 --> 08:56.478
Butt, are you kidding me?
Mouth cancer's not a thing.

08:56.513 --> 08:58.180
That chick is brainwashing you.

08:58.215 --> 09:00.215
Come on, we're
having fun together.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.185
- You met at a coffee shop.
- Yeah, Zorn.

09:03.220 --> 09:06.788
She met me
in a coffee shop bathroom,

09:06.823 --> 09:09.357
wasted off my ass,
covered in my own vomit.

09:09.393 --> 09:13.261
She took me in, cleaned me up,
got me into the program.

09:13.297 --> 09:15.964
If it weren't for her,
I just... I don't know.

09:15.999 --> 09:18.800
I'm just saying,
she saved me, man.

09:18.835 --> 09:21.870
- I had to grow up sooner or later.
- No, I get it, I get it.

09:21.905 --> 09:24.072
It's just, life here is so boring.

09:24.107 --> 09:26.841
I was so psyched for one night
of fun with my best friend.

09:26.877 --> 09:30.412
Okay? Two pals reliving
the glory days, that's all.

09:32.749 --> 09:36.318
Tell you what.
Let's swing by that work party.

09:36.353 --> 09:38.820
You can buy me a club soda.

09:40.924 --> 09:42.023
[pop music playing]

What's up? What's up?

- Who's this?
- Uh, this is, uh, Head... [clears throat]

- Oh, hey.

Uh, I'm gonna go
say hi to someone. So...

10:07.284 --> 10:10.552
- Dorothy Clementina, I'll...
- Finally.

10:10.587 --> 10:13.588
- So, Clementina, huh? That's a...
- Where can I drop a B.M.?

10:13.624 --> 10:16.091
Uh... I mean,
there's a bathroom

10:16.126 --> 10:17.892
- over there, I think.
- Bathroom?

10:17.928 --> 10:20.595
[laughs] No, no.
Someplace cooler.

10:20.631 --> 10:22.063

<i>ZORN: Listen up,

10:25.335 --> 10:27.736
This is Butt, my best

10:27.771 --> 10:29.437
And if he does
something you enjoy,

10:29.473 --> 10:33.174
the chant goes like this:
"Butt! Butt! Butt! Butt!"

10:33.210 --> 10:34.743

Whoa, whoa.
Two beers?

- Are you sure about this, pal?
- Ah, it's okay, Zorn.

11:01.438 --> 11:02.637
A couple sips won't hurt me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey, before you take that drink,

- I'm sorry.

11:22.859 --> 11:24.826
- You just look so familiar.
- All right, look.

11:24.861 --> 11:28.396
It's true, we have met before.
Does Arrowhead ring a bell?

11:28.432 --> 11:30.265
- Arrowhead.
- CRAIG: Okay, let me guess.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.101
Arrowhead is a guy whose head
is shaped like an arrow,

11:33.136 --> 11:35.203
and when he opens his mouth,
arrows come out

11:35.238 --> 11:37.505
and they shoot you,
and then you turn into an arrow,

11:37.541 --> 11:39.574
and then you shoot other people
in the head.

11:39.609 --> 11:40.675
No. That's Archeron.

11:40.711 --> 11:45.313
Arrowhead was our
seventh grade summer camp.

11:45.349 --> 11:48.516
You're Lizzy Jones!
Oh!

11:48.552 --> 11:49.984
Why didn't you just say so?

11:50.020 --> 11:53.788
Well, I had a boyfriend at the time,
and you kissed him.

11:53.824 --> 11:56.358
- Ooh!
- What?

11:56.393 --> 11:59.227
- Yeah. Josh Kirschenbaum?
- Oh, I remember Josh.

11:59.262 --> 12:02.664
But Josh was going out
with me at the time, so...

12:02.699 --> 12:04.199
- Oh!
- I mean, that's not

12:04.234 --> 12:05.800
how it happened,
but that's okay, I don't care.

12:05.836 --> 12:08.002
Well, that is definitely
how it happened,

12:08.038 --> 12:09.838
but I don't care either.

12:09.873 --> 12:14.576
CRAIG: Well, my opinion?
I do care, and I want answers.

12:14.611 --> 12:16.611
<i>ALAN: So then I was like,
"H-2-O?</i>

12:16.646 --> 12:20.415

- [laughs] That is bad.
- Awesome.

12:22.503 --> 12:24.586
- No. Bad.
- You nailed it.

12:24.621 --> 12:28.957
You know, actually, I'm really
happy I came to this party.

12:28.992 --> 12:31.559
Even though I normally
hate parties.

12:31.595 --> 12:33.428
Well, I'm-I'm glad
you came, too.

12:33.463 --> 12:35.330
And I did, as well.

12:35.365 --> 12:39.434
- So... yeah.
- HEADBUTT GIRL: Yeah, me also.

12:40.470 --> 12:41.870
Where's your friend?

12:41.905 --> 12:44.139
Because I want him for sex,
you know? He kind of ran away.

12:44.174 --> 12:46.040
He, uh, y...
I don't know, sorry.

12:46.076 --> 12:48.977
[scoffs] All right.
I'll check the bathroom, I guess,

12:49.012 --> 12:50.712
'cause he seems obsessed
with the location.

12:50.747 --> 12:53.214
- Good luck.
- All right.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.817

like, a family friend.

SHANNON: Layla, Alan.
Come on, we're going swimming.

12:58.422 --> 13:00.722
No, no suit here.
So, uh-uh.

13:00.757 --> 13:02.157
<i>SHANNON: Just put one
of your socks on it.</i>

13:02.192 --> 13:04.459
That's what my dad does.

13:04.494 --> 13:07.662
- Mm.
- Did you see Shannon's outie?

13:07.697 --> 13:09.864
It looks like a baby finger.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.900
Well, that's... Things that are
weird about people,

13:11.935 --> 13:13.668
what's that all about?

13:13.703 --> 13:17.205
- You coming?
- I just ate. So, ugh.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.608
Oh, no. You could still
probably swim, though.

13:20.644 --> 13:22.110
I'll ge...
I'll get a cramp.

13:22.145 --> 13:23.945
The next thing you know, be a lawsuit.

13:23.980 --> 13:25.747
I don't want to be involved.

13:25.782 --> 13:27.582
Okay.

Oh, right.

- You can tell me anything.
- All right. Look.

14:11.164 --> 14:13.231
The real reason we came
was 'cause Elizabeth

14:13.266 --> 14:16.101
wants me to see a
neurologist at UCLA.

- Wait. What?
- Klorpins, the cave doctor,

14:18.171 --> 14:21.439

a lifetime of ramming stuff.

one more thing, I could die.

14:52.806 --> 14:54.039
It's been a long time, huh?

<i>Yeah, a long while.

14:57.577 --> 15:00.111
Yeah, so, listen, I'm writing
a memoir about my childhood.

15:00.147 --> 15:03.915
It's called
A Life of Wonder: Michael's Tale.

15:03.950 --> 15:05.784
And, um, it's being
published by Knopf.

15:05.819 --> 15:07.952
I don't know if you heard
of them... and Random House

15:07.988 --> 15:09.621

They were sort of sniffing

15:09.656 --> 15:12.023
and trying to make...
Anyways, I was wondering,

15:12.059 --> 15:15.226
maybe you can clear up some
stories from my camp days?

15:15.262 --> 15:18.797

named Edie or Lizzy?

<i>Come on, Mike, I had,
like, 11 girlfriends.</i>

15:21.868 --> 15:25.103

uh, who did you like more,

15:25.138 --> 15:27.138
Edie or Lizzie?

15:27.174 --> 15:28.673
<i>Well, okay, let's see.</i>

15:28.709 --> 15:31.743
<i>Obviously, Lizzy was Lizzy the Ho,
so she was fun,</i>

15:31.778 --> 15:32.744
<i>but also kind of gross.</i>

15:32.779 --> 15:35.914
<i>And Edie...
she was hot but totally flat.</i>

15:35.949 --> 15:37.515
- Oh, my God!
- Hey!

15:37.551 --> 15:39.150
- Who was that?
- You know what?

15:39.186 --> 15:41.619
It's Edie Bennett
and Lizzy the Ho, you fart-sack!

15:41.655 --> 15:43.021
<i>Hey, Mike, what the hell is this?</i>

15:43.056 --> 15:44.255
- Look, you need help at all...
- Just hang up.

15:44.291 --> 15:48.193
- [beep] Just hang up.
- Such a jerk, that guy! [phone vibrates]

15:48.228 --> 15:50.428
- Well, it's settled.
- Wait, something's wrong.

15:50.464 --> 15:51.764
I mean, this looks like Head

15:51.765 --> 15:54.599
when he texts with his head
and not his thumbs.

15:54.634 --> 15:57.102
I'm telling ya,
all it took was one headbutt,

15:57.137 --> 16:00.463
and that little girl went flying!

16:01.041 --> 16:03.341
Am I the only one that finds
this story disturbing?

16:03.376 --> 16:06.044
- Yes.
- Hey, Butt Man,

why don't you put your head
where your mouth is?

that chair with your head?</i>

if there's any cheese left,

16:19.493 --> 16:22.193

I love this guy.

16:24.631 --> 16:26.531
It's too dangerous!
[crowd grumbles]

16:26.566 --> 16:27.766
- You suck!
- ZORN: They say if you see something,

16:27.801 --> 16:29.367
you're supposed to
say something. Well, I...

16:29.402 --> 16:32.470
- [chuckles] Hey, you.
- Zorn, where are you guys?

16:32.506 --> 16:35.173
- Elizabeth is freaking out.
- Uh, still at the party.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.008
Just, you know,
sipping our Shirley Temples.

16:37.043 --> 16:38.777
<i>I'll do it.
You think I won't?</i>

16:38.812 --> 16:40.278
Oh, is that Butt?

16:40.313 --> 16:42.480
<i>LINDA: You really think
you can headbutt my truck?</i>

16:42.516 --> 16:44.249
- It's a V-8!
- No, no, no, no.

16:44.284 --> 16:45.817
- Butt! Linda! Butt!
- Let's take this party to the next level!

16:45.852 --> 16:47.452
<i>ZORN: Edie, just tell Elizabeth...</i>

16:47.487 --> 16:49.888
Tell Elizabeth what?
She's terrified.

16:49.923 --> 16:51.523
<i>How did I even get...
[phone beeps]</i>

16:51.558 --> 16:53.858
Phew. [chuckles]
That was a close one.

16:53.894 --> 16:55.326
Hey, where'd everyone go?

16:55.362 --> 16:59.130
Uh, I think I heard
somebody say something

16:59.166 --> 17:00.532
about headbutting a truck?

17:00.567 --> 17:04.135
Who's gonna headbutt the truck...
I-I have no idea.

17:05.962 --> 17:09.916
Oh, my God,
you're so disgusting.

17:10.098 --> 17:11.566
- Are you eating my deodorant?
- Yeah.

17:11.601 --> 17:13.468
I want my mouth to smell
like your armpits.

17:13.502 --> 17:16.069
- What's the big deal?
- What is she even doing here?

17:16.105 --> 17:17.704
- Who invited her?
- He did.

17:17.740 --> 17:20.842
What? Me?
No, I didn't... not really.

17:20.877 --> 17:23.644
She's just, like,
my dad's friend's, uh...

17:23.680 --> 17:26.948
This is a party, Alan,
not a zoo for freaks.

17:26.983 --> 17:29.818
[laughter] All right.
Well, that one was harsh.

17:29.819 --> 17:32.954
That one I can't forget.
TF... too far.

17:32.989 --> 17:35.590
<i>I think we're all saying
stuff we're gonna regret.</i>

17:35.625 --> 17:38.993
- Hey, Shannon, she's not a freak.
- Look at her.

17:39.028 --> 17:41.028
- She has a mustache.
- HEADBUTT GIRL: Okay.

17:41.064 --> 17:42.530
<i>ALAN: Yeah, yeah,
she's got a mustache.</i>

17:42.565 --> 17:44.532
- All right, well...
- She also has teenage gout.

17:44.567 --> 17:48.269
She also says she has to go to
the bathroom all the time, and...

17:48.304 --> 17:50.538
Also, my nipples are
the opposite of small.

17:50.573 --> 17:51.806
Just let me
get through this, okay?

17:51.841 --> 17:53.307
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all you. It's all you.

17:53.343 --> 17:54.675
It's all you.

17:54.711 --> 17:56.511
Everyone has something
weird about them.

17:56.546 --> 17:58.880
But she knows who she is
and she doesn't care.

17:58.915 --> 18:02.517
She owns it. And that's...
I think that's pretty cool.

18:02.552 --> 18:03.885
It's a lot cooler than I am.

18:04.220 --> 18:06.086
SHANNON: Whatever.

18:06.122 --> 18:07.888
I'm gonna go have sex
in my little sister's room.

18:07.924 --> 18:10.291
<i>- Me, too.
- All right, let's go. [sighs]</i>

18:10.359 --> 18:13.761
Hey.
Thanks, Alangulon.

18:13.796 --> 18:16.896
You know what?
Thank you, Headbutt Girl. [grunts]

18:16.931 --> 18:18.732
[crowd gasping]
[Alan groans]

18:18.918 --> 18:21.752
<i>- ALAN: What the hell?!
- I told you, only my dad calls me that.</i>

18:21.787 --> 18:26.423
What the hell are you looking at?!
You want to go?! [grunts]

18:26.459 --> 18:27.691
That's what I thought.

18:27.727 --> 18:29.526
I'm gonna go find a rug
to scoot on.

18:29.562 --> 18:30.794
<i>LAYLA: Oh, my God.</i>

18:30.830 --> 18:34.531
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just, like...

18:34.567 --> 18:35.933
You know, I could
have a concussion,

18:35.968 --> 18:38.569
so you probably have to stay
with me all night, you know?

18:38.604 --> 18:40.537
Oh, I have to stay
with you all night?

18:40.573 --> 18:42.206
Well, just in case.
If I have a concussion,

18:42.241 --> 18:44.174
I'm not liable for anything
I say, just so you know.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.476
Yeah, okay.

18:45.511 --> 18:47.845
No, I'm telling you, Butt,
do not do this!

18:47.880 --> 18:50.981
- You're gonna die!
- I'm fine, Zorny.

18:51.017 --> 18:52.883
This is what I was born to do.

18:52.918 --> 18:55.886
- Out of the way, Zorn!
- Linda, will you please?

18:55.921 --> 18:57.388
Linda, stop.
You don't understand.

18:57.423 --> 18:59.390
Hey, Butt Man brought this on himself.

18:59.425 --> 19:00.758
You don't mess with the devil.

19:00.793 --> 19:04.194
<i>ZORN: I need to talk
to Boss Linda now.</i>

19:04.230 --> 19:06.597
Okay. Boss Linda here.
You're fired, Zorn!

19:06.632 --> 19:08.565
- Linda, please.
- Now Slayer Linda's back.

19:08.601 --> 19:10.000
- Linda...
- You're not fired, Zorn.

19:10.036 --> 19:11.769
- Stop!
- And your friend is gonna die!

19:11.804 --> 19:14.738
Linda, you shouldn't even be
driving right now. [screaming]

19:14.774 --> 19:17.207
[rock music playing,
engine revving]

19:17.243 --> 19:18.142
Stop!

19:18.177 --> 19:21.245
Stop, stop!
Stop!

19:21.280 --> 19:22.579
[gasps]

19:22.648 --> 19:25.049
Stop!
[tires screech]

19:25.084 --> 19:26.683
<i>HEADBUTT MAN: Elizabeth?</i>

19:26.719 --> 19:29.386
Oh, God, what have I done?
[crying]

19:29.422 --> 19:31.889
<i>- LINDA: Shh, shh, shh.
- HEADBUTT: Look at me!</i>

19:31.924 --> 19:34.091
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here now.

19:34.126 --> 19:36.193
<i>Shh, shh, shh.
[Headbutt Man crying]</i>

19:36.228 --> 19:38.896
Augusta Canal.
Oswego Canal.

19:38.931 --> 19:41.031
Saint Clair Harbor.
Flats Canal.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.266
<i>Yeah!</i>

19:42.301 --> 19:43.967
<i>CROWD [chanting]:
Butt! Butt! Butt!</i>

19:44.003 --> 19:47.237
<i>Oh, man, he did it!
He actually headbutted a unicorn!</i>

19:47.273 --> 19:49.873
<i>Dude, you look
awesome right now.</i>

19:49.909 --> 19:51.775
<i>[groaning]
I don't like myself, Zorn.</i>

19:51.844 --> 19:54.711
<i>I can't live like this.
I need help!</i>

19:54.747 --> 19:57.181
So that's what happened
to my eye.

19:57.216 --> 19:59.650
- [chuckles] I always wondered.
- Yeah, I guess I never watched

19:59.685 --> 20:01.285
this video all the way to the end.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.587
I can't believe I almost died
for one last headbutt.

20:03.622 --> 20:05.589
Well, I guess there's
an argument to be made

20:05.624 --> 20:07.925
that it's better to have you
around boring and alive

20:07.960 --> 20:10.160
than awesome and
dead, you know?

20:10.196 --> 20:12.496
Hey, hey. Just want to say
a quick good-bye to everybody.

20:12.531 --> 20:16.066
Ooh, your head still
looks terrible.

20:16.102 --> 20:17.734
Yeah. It's on me,
though, you know?

20:17.770 --> 20:19.303
I shouldn't have got
in the way of the faucet

20:19.338 --> 20:20.270
like I did. Just... Whoo!

20:20.306 --> 20:22.906
<i>HEADBUTT GIRL: Well, maybe that happened
because you pissed off the faucet.</i>

20:22.942 --> 20:25.810
If you could read between the lines,
you would know that the faucet

20:25.811 --> 20:28.679
was hoping you were the one she
could give her special flower to,

20:28.714 --> 20:31.048
but now the faucet will
have to give it up to some

20:31.049 --> 20:33.383
stranger on a changing table
in the airport bathroom!

20:33.419 --> 20:35.619
Okay, that's enough, Butty-cakes.

20:35.654 --> 20:36.386
[snorts]
[chuckles]

20:36.422 --> 20:40.524
- Oh, that's my daughter.
- Well, guess you guys should hit the road,

20:40.559 --> 20:42.659
but not with your head.
[laughs]

20:42.695 --> 20:45.062
You get it?
'Cause you're brain-damaged.

20:45.097 --> 20:46.663
Dang it.
Where'd I put my keys?

20:46.699 --> 20:48.799
Got 'em right here for
you buddy. Here you go.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.156
[grunts]
[gasps]

20:50.469 --> 20:52.603
Butt?
