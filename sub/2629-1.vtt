Sorry I'm late, man.

02:08.348 --> 02:10.214
I saw my karate instructor
on the way here,

02:10.251 --> 02:11.980
and I had to chat with him
for a little while

02:12.019 --> 02:13.452
to be polite;
that's why—

02:13.487 --> 02:16.547
- Hey, I don't need to know
about your life, asshole.

02:16.590 --> 02:18.080
You got the cash?

02:18.125 --> 02:19.956
- Sorry.

02:19.994 --> 02:21.791
Of course I got the cash.

02:21.829 --> 02:24.525
- Put it on the ground.

02:24.565 --> 02:26.089
- Okay.

02:29.804 --> 02:31.772
- Okay, now give it to me.

02:34.041 --> 02:35.668
- You can count it again if you like.

02:35.710 --> 02:36.836
It's all in there.

02:36.877 --> 02:38.504
- I just counted it by looking at it.

02:38.546 --> 02:39.979
I know it's okay.

02:40.014 --> 02:41.345
- Okay, cool.

02:43.551 --> 02:44.779

02:46.787 --> 02:47.811

02:47.855 --> 02:49.618
I-I don't understand.

02:49.657 --> 02:51.147
- Everything's inside.

02:51.192 --> 02:53.160
It's easier to carry.
More discreet.

02:53.194 --> 02:54.422
- Oh, yeah?

02:54.462 --> 02:56.896
But how do I
get the stuff out?

02:56.931 --> 02:58.398
- Are you dumb or what?

02:58.432 --> 02:59.558
You take a knife.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.727

You smoke it.

03:04.772 --> 03:06.239
Can you manage that?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.867
Or do you need an instruction manual?

03:08.909 --> 03:09.876
- Nah, I'm okay.

03:09.910 --> 03:10.899
That works.

03:10.945 --> 03:11.969
- Oh, that's good.

03:12.013 --> 03:13.139
You're smart.

That is your name, correct?

05:55.409 --> 05:56.671
- Yes.

05:56.710 --> 05:59.270
Are you gonna tell me what's wrong
or not?

05:59.313 --> 06:01.372
- I'm gonna need you to
come down and see me later today

06:01.415 --> 06:03.883

I'm sorry.  I don't understand.

06:11.425 --> 06:13.484
Why can't you just tell me
what's wrong?

06:13.527 --> 06:14.789
Why are you being so mysterious?

06:14.828 --> 06:15.954
- I am not being mysterious.

This is standard procedure, ma'am.

what the problem is

I'm gonna need your

- Well, here we are.

- Okay.  Nice atmosphere.

- How long has he been there?

09:40.968 --> 09:42.230
- About an hour.

and when we came back,

09:49.042 --> 09:51.306
he was there.

- Did you know him?

- Well, he had an extra set
of my keys,

10:03.757 --> 10:05.816
you know, just in case.

10:05.859 --> 10:08.623
Can't imagine why he had to come
into my living room

10:08.662 --> 10:09.686
to kill himself, though.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.631
I-I don't understand.

10:12.666 --> 10:15.100
- Maybe he just didn't want
to dirty his own place up.

10:15.135 --> 10:17.626
- It could be just as simple as that.

right now.

- No.

10:46.667 --> 10:50.194
- Well, for the investigation.

that you would suspect me
of murder.

I mean, the body is in my house.

59:01.158 --> 59:02.250
Ugh!

59:02.293 --> 59:04.625
- Screw you!

59:04.662 --> 59:06.357
- [groans]

59:17.875 --> 59:19.342
- That's the one.  That's him.

59:19.377 --> 59:20.674
I recognize him.  That is the man.

59:20.711 --> 59:21.905
- Out.

59:21.946 --> 59:24.039
- W-why?

59:24.081 --> 59:25.776
Why?

59:25.816 --> 59:26.942
[laughter]

59:26.984 --> 59:28.008
- Get out.
- Us?

59:28.052 --> 59:29.041
- What?
- Get the fuck out!

59:29.086 --> 59:30.110
- Wait, whoa, whoa.

59:30.154 --> 59:31.178
- Get out!

59:31.222 --> 59:32.553
- Ow!

59:37.161 --> 59:39.493
- Aah!

59:39.530 --> 59:42.192
Motherfucking bitch!

59:45.035 --> 59:46.059
Ooh!

[ringing continues]

01:00:04.922 --> 01:00:06.253
- Yes?

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.917
- Hey, it's Duke.

01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:10.051
- Hi.

01:00:10.094 --> 01:00:13.723
- <i>So, you’re alive.</i>

01:00:13.764 --> 01:00:15.527
- Yes, I'm alive.

01:00:15.566 --> 01:00:16.931
I'm fine.
[sniffs]

01:00:16.967 --> 01:00:18.195
- You sound strange.

01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:20.669
Why are you breathing
like that?

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:22.001
- That's nothing.

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:24.303
I'm just cold.  Nothing.

01:00:24.341 --> 01:00:27.902
- So are you finished
with your bullshit now or what?

01:00:27.945 --> 01:00:29.310
- Yeah.

01:00:29.346 --> 01:00:30.836
I tell you, I'm fine.

01:00:30.881 --> 01:00:32.109
[breathes heavily]

01:00:32.149 --> 01:00:33.275
- <i>Good.</i>.

01:00:33.317 --> 01:00:34.614
If I ever see you

01:00:34.652 --> 01:00:37.644
in such a homo
state of weakness again,

01:00:37.688 --> 01:00:39.815
I will kill you myself.

01:00:39.857 --> 01:00:41.654
Do you understand?

01:00:41.692 --> 01:00:42.920
- Do that.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.985
That works for me.

01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:47.293
- <i>Be a man, Rough!</i>

01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:48.855
Fag.

01:00:50.668 --> 01:00:52.727
What the fuck are you doing?

01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:54.397
Why don't you raise the shutter

01:00:54.438 --> 01:00:56.998
instead of crawling out
like a fucking lizard?

01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:58.770
- It's broken.
It won't open anymore.

01:00:58.809 --> 01:01:01.505
I need to get it fixed.

01:01:01.545 --> 01:01:02.603
- [chuckling]
God.

01:01:02.646 --> 01:01:04.614
You Chinese people.

01:01:04.648 --> 01:01:06.115
You make me laugh.

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.482
You're really good salespeople,

01:01:08.519 --> 01:01:09.781
but for everything else,

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.617
you really are big dweebs.

01:01:11.655 --> 01:01:13.054
Get the fucking thing fixed!

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.216
This is ridiculous!

01:01:14.258 --> 01:01:15.589
- I'll take care of it.

01:01:15.626 --> 01:01:17.560
Geez.   Here.

01:01:17.595 --> 01:01:19.358
- How many do we have this time?

01:01:19.396 --> 01:01:21.125
- There's been a little problem.

01:01:21.165 --> 01:01:22.632
It's not the usual.

01:01:22.666 --> 01:01:23.724
- What do you mean?

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:24.791
- [sighs]

01:01:24.835 --> 01:01:26.359
Look, I can't catch the rats anymore.

01:01:26.403 --> 01:01:28.337
I-I think they figured out
how my trap works.

01:01:28.372 --> 01:01:29.464
It's over.

01:01:29.507 --> 01:01:31.975
I didn't catch
a single one this week.

01:01:32.009 --> 01:01:34.807
- Wait a minute.

01:01:34.845 --> 01:01:38.212
You want me to sell the dope
in this?

01:01:38.249 --> 01:01:40.342
You can't be fucking serious.

01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:41.408
- Why not?

01:01:41.452 --> 01:01:42.714
It—it's kind of the same.

01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:43.879
It's the same size.

01:01:43.921 --> 01:01:45.411
You can put it in your pocket
like a rat.

01:01:45.456 --> 01:01:46.445
It's the same.

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.151
- It's disgusting to touch!

01:01:48.192 --> 01:01:49.784
It stinks!

01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:51.260
Are you sick?

01:01:51.295 --> 01:01:53.126
Are you trying to kill my business?

01:01:53.163 --> 01:01:54.221
Fucking fish?

01:01:54.265 --> 01:01:55.493
- I can't help it, Duke.

01:01:55.533 --> 01:01:57.160
I'm telling you,
I can't catch the rats anymore.

01:01:57.201 --> 01:01:59.328
They're too smart.

01:06:04.281 --> 01:06:05.407
Fuck.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.110
- Daddy?

01:06:09.987 --> 01:06:11.887
What is this?

01:06:11.922 --> 01:06:13.890
- Oh, no.

01:06:13.924 --> 01:06:14.982
Oh, no!

01:06:15.025 --> 01:06:16.185
No.

[taps on glass]

01:07:24.862 --> 01:07:25.954
- Hey, there.

01:07:25.996 --> 01:07:27.020
How are you?

01:07:27.064 --> 01:07:28.053
- I'm great.

01:07:28.098 --> 01:07:29.395
I'm not the guy who's dead,

01:07:29.433 --> 01:07:30.900
so I can't complain.

01:07:30.934 --> 01:07:32.902
What do you want?

01:07:32.936 --> 01:07:35.131
- You think I could get a hit
off that joint?

01:07:35.172 --> 01:07:37.072
Cemeteries stress me out,

01:07:37.107 --> 01:07:39.507
and I think a little toke would help.

01:07:39.543 --> 01:07:41.374
- Yeah, you know,
this is not actually smoking

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:42.605
just for the hell of it.

01:07:42.646 --> 01:07:44.113
I'm testing a new weed,

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:45.978
so I have to smoke the whole joint

01:07:46.016 --> 01:07:49.679
to test the quality, you know?

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.347
- I understand.

01:07:51.388 --> 01:07:52.412
- Sorry.

01:07:52.456 --> 01:07:54.754
- Not a problem.

01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:57.919
[breathing deeply]

01:07:57.961 --> 01:08:00.122
Is that your joint that
smells like fish?

01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:01.494
- No.

01:08:04.635 --> 01:08:07.604
[dramatic music]

01:08:07.638 --> 01:08:15.636
? ?

01:08:45.475 --> 01:08:47.443
No one has told me anything.

01:08:47.477 --> 01:08:49.502
What happened, exactly?

01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:51.946
- He stabbed himself in the throat

01:08:51.982 --> 01:08:53.950
with some garden tool.

01:08:53.984 --> 01:08:55.611
- Oh, fuck, no.

01:08:55.652 --> 01:08:57.017
- Disgusting.

01:08:58.988 --> 01:09:00.616
- That's tough, though.
- Yeah.

01:09:00.657 --> 01:09:02.249
- Shh!

01:09:02.292 --> 01:09:03.691
- Hey, leave us alone.

01:09:03.727 --> 01:09:05.388
- Yeah, why don't you go suck
each other's balls

01:09:05.429 --> 01:09:06.555
and leave us alone?

01:09:06.595 --> 01:09:07.721
- No, we don't do that.

01:09:07.764 --> 01:09:09.060
You should show some respect.

01:09:09.099 --> 01:09:10.225
This is a funeral,
God damn it.

01:09:13.804 --> 01:09:14.828
[casket thuds]

01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:16.337
- Okay, everybody.

01:09:16.372 --> 01:09:17.772
Listen up.
I'm sorry.

01:09:17.808 --> 01:09:19.935
My wife's right in the middle
of giving birth,

01:09:19.977 --> 01:09:22.411
so I'm not gonna be able
to hang around forever here.

01:09:22.446 --> 01:09:23.504
Um...

01:09:23.546 --> 01:09:25.139
[clears throat]

01:09:25.182 --> 01:09:28.982
I have a prepared speech.

01:09:29.019 --> 01:09:30.714
Don't know where the hell it is now.

01:09:30.754 --> 01:09:31.880
[chuckles]

01:09:31.921 --> 01:09:34.254
Um, anyway, uh...

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:37.917
I'm not really very good
at this kind of bullshit,

01:09:37.961 --> 01:09:39.986
but what I can say is,

01:09:40.029 --> 01:09:44.433
Simon William Shine,
also known as Sunshine,

01:09:44.468 --> 01:09:48.837
took his own life into his hands.

01:09:48.872 --> 01:09:50.499
And as I speak to you now,

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.337
his tormented soul

01:09:52.376 --> 01:09:54.071
is most certainly on its way to hell,

01:09:54.111 --> 01:09:56.671
since, as we all know,

01:09:56.713 --> 01:09:58.977
anyone who goes against
God's will

01:09:59.016 --> 01:10:01.007
ends up in hell.

01:10:03.086 --> 01:10:06.988
So, Sunshine...

01:10:07.024 --> 01:10:09.549
I salute you.

01:10:09.593 --> 01:10:12.960
You will forever remain
in our hearts,

01:10:12.996 --> 01:10:15.931
and I wish you a good journey.

01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:17.263
- Excuse me, Captain.

01:10:19.002 --> 01:10:20.299
I don't want to offend you,

01:10:20.337 --> 01:10:22.305
but you were just saluting
the sky,

01:10:22.339 --> 01:10:25.638
and hell is under our feet,
underground.

01:10:25.675 --> 01:10:26.903
- Yeah, I know that.

01:10:26.943 --> 01:10:28.171
It just seems more natural

01:10:28.211 --> 01:10:30.736
to salute the soul of the departed

01:10:30.781 --> 01:10:34.239
towards the sky
rather than toward the ground.

01:10:36.153 --> 01:10:38.781
Don't you agree?
It's more poetic.

01:10:38.822 --> 01:10:40.119
- I don't think so.

01:10:40.157 --> 01:10:41.852
[scoffs]
It looks weird.

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:43.689
- Oh, it's even weirder
to salute the ground.

01:10:43.727 --> 01:10:45.160
Look.
Huh?

01:10:45.195 --> 01:10:46.822
"Hi!

01:10:46.863 --> 01:10:48.330
Have a nice trip down to hell,
buddy!"

01:10:48.365 --> 01:10:50.629
Huh?
Right?

01:10:50.667 --> 01:10:52.294
- Okay, I take it back.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:53.529
You're right.
Sorry.

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:56.733
- Well, if you want my opinion,
Captain,

01:10:56.773 --> 01:10:59.674
I think we have the wrong idea
about hell,

01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:03.475
just exactly like
we have the wrong idea

01:11:03.513 --> 01:11:05.310
about paradise.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:07.646
- What do you mean by that,
Duke?

01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:11.450
- I mean, I'm a Christian,

01:11:11.488 --> 01:11:14.457
but I've learned to not believe

01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:15.788
those things we're told

01:11:15.826 --> 01:11:17.589
in those old books.

01:11:17.627 --> 01:11:21.324
You have to read between
the lines and decipher,

01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:23.389
because, in reality,

01:11:23.433 --> 01:11:25.367
hell is here.

01:11:25.402 --> 01:11:28.235
This world
that we walk around in,

01:11:28.271 --> 01:11:31.399
that we live in every day,

01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:33.136
is hell.

01:11:33.176 --> 01:11:36.805
We have invisible flames
around us.

01:11:36.847 --> 01:11:38.144
You can't see them,

01:11:38.181 --> 01:11:41.116
but we all have invisible flames
around us.

01:11:41.151 --> 01:11:44.746
We get burned every day, but we
just don't realize it.

01:11:44.788 --> 01:11:49.691
I mean, we are just
miserable slaves to nature.

01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:51.785
- Duke, I don't think anyone
wants to hear

01:11:51.828 --> 01:11:54.319
what you're saying right now.

01:11:54.364 --> 01:11:57.197
Wouldn't you rather just say a little
word about Sunshine?

01:11:57.234 --> 01:11:58.360
[chuckles]

01:11:58.401 --> 01:11:59.925
- Yeah, well,
I was getting to it, Andy.

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:02.700
I mean, I think...

01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:08.177
I think that Sunshine left hell
for a better place.

01:12:08.211 --> 01:12:11.840
I think that we are the dead,
and he is alive.

01:12:11.882 --> 01:12:15.579
I mean, I know it sounds weird,
kind of, said like that,

01:12:15.619 --> 01:12:17.587
but I do believe that.

01:12:17.621 --> 01:12:22.354
And we should not cry
for Sunshine, my brothers.

01:12:22.392 --> 01:12:25.486
We should cry for ourselves,

01:12:25.529 --> 01:12:28.157
because we are in hell.

01:12:28.198 --> 01:12:31.167
[tense music]

01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:39.199
? ?

01:12:42.612 --> 01:12:44.375
[breathes heavily]

01:12:44.414 --> 01:12:46.678
Wow.

01:12:46.716 --> 01:12:47.683
[clears throat]

01:12:47.717 --> 01:12:48.877
Wait a minute.

01:12:51.021 --> 01:12:52.989
That is a wild ride I was on.

01:12:53.023 --> 01:12:54.115
[breathes heavily]

01:12:54.157 --> 01:12:58.116
I am so stoned right now.

01:12:58.161 --> 01:12:59.321
Shit.

01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:04.456
[indistinct chatter]

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:07.459
[cork pops]

01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:19.042
- Thanks.

01:13:19.082 --> 01:13:20.913
You dick!

01:13:58.188 --> 01:13:59.655
- I wanted to tell you

01:13:59.689 --> 01:14:02.317
that what you said about hell...

01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:04.156
that was beautiful.

01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:07.391
I loved listening to you.

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.330
- Well,
I'm glad you liked it, ma'am.

01:14:09.366 --> 01:14:10.890
I just made it up.

01:14:10.934 --> 01:14:12.162
[chuckles]

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:14.193
Uh, who—who are you again?

01:14:14.237 --> 01:14:15.499
- I'm Sunshine's wife.

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:16.562
- Ah.

01:14:16.606 --> 01:14:17.732
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah.

01:14:17.774 --> 01:14:19.332
Okay, I see.

01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:21.537
- And I think you're completely right.

01:14:21.578 --> 01:14:23.671
We really do live in hell.

01:14:23.713 --> 01:14:24.941
I love this theory.

01:14:24.981 --> 01:14:29.384
It—it allows you to consider
death differently.

01:14:29.419 --> 01:14:32.013
It's a very powerful idea.

01:14:32.055 --> 01:14:33.147
- Hmm.

01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:39.655
- [echoing] And I think you
should write a book...

01:14:41.097 --> 01:14:43.964
- I've forgotten what you just said.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.763
[chuckles]

01:14:45.802 --> 01:14:49.863
- I said I-I think
you should write a book

01:14:49.906 --> 01:14:51.533
on your theory.

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.303
It's a very interesting subject,

01:14:53.343 --> 01:14:56.039
and you seem to master it.

01:14:56.079 --> 01:14:57.137
- Yeah, see,

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:59.478
I don't know how to explain this.

01:14:59.516 --> 01:15:02.485
Your words go in my ears,

01:15:02.519 --> 01:15:05.386
but then they don't make it
to the processor.

01:15:05.422 --> 01:15:07.322
- Do you want me to repeat it again?

01:15:07.357 --> 01:15:08.654
- [sniffing]
No.

01:15:08.692 --> 01:15:10.159
Hey, wow.  Hang on.

01:15:10.193 --> 01:15:12.058
Who—who smells like bad fish?
Is that you?

01:15:12.095 --> 01:15:14.222
- Oh, no.
No, it's not.

01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:15.322
I think it's you.

01:15:15.365 --> 01:15:18.095
- Wow, what a gross, horrible stench.

01:15:18.134 --> 01:15:20.364
[sniffs]
No. No, no.

01:15:20.403 --> 01:15:21.961
[sniffs]
No, it's not me.

01:15:22.005 --> 01:15:23.973
Hey, who's that?

01:15:24.007 --> 01:15:25.474
Who's that little bitch over there?

01:15:25.508 --> 01:15:26.634
Maybe it's her.

01:15:26.676 --> 01:15:27.734
- That is my daughter.

01:15:27.777 --> 01:15:29.802
Watch your language.

01:15:29.846 --> 01:15:31.108
- Well, I think it's her.

01:15:31.147 --> 01:15:33.012
- You're the one who stinks,
you dickhead.

01:15:33.049 --> 01:15:34.141
Come on, Mom.
Let's go.

01:15:34.184 --> 01:15:35.913
Don't talk to that guy.

01:15:38.521 --> 01:15:39.988
- Yeah, fuck off!

01:15:40.023 --> 01:15:42.548
Psh.  Write a book.

01:15:46.863 --> 01:15:48.558
Write a book about what?

01:15:48.598 --> 01:15:51.567
[dramatic music]

01:15:51.601 --> 01:15:59.770
? ?

01:15:59.809 --> 01:16:01.299
Hey.

01:16:02.979 --> 01:16:04.037
Hey!

01:16:07.317 --> 01:16:08.978
Write a book about what?

01:16:11.454 --> 01:16:14.355
Write a book about what?

01:16:15.892 --> 01:16:17.723
Write a book about what?

01:16:37.547 --> 01:16:39.344
- Well, like I told you,

01:16:39.382 --> 01:16:40.872
this could be a big hit.

01:16:42.685 --> 01:16:44.016
I think.

01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:49.158
[upbeat techno music]

01:16:49.192 --> 01:16:51.490
? ?

01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:52.893
- I like it.

01:16:52.929 --> 01:16:54.692
- Yeah.

01:16:54.731 --> 01:16:57.029
Yeah, this has got a great groove.

01:16:57.066 --> 01:16:58.590
How do you do that?

01:16:58.635 --> 01:17:00.603
Oh, this is a killer.

01:17:00.637 --> 01:17:03.697
- Well, it's about the feeling.

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.037
It's all about the feeling.

01:17:05.074 --> 01:17:06.632
- You have some good feeling.

01:17:06.676 --> 01:17:07.734
It's supercool.

01:17:07.777 --> 01:17:09.244
I love it.

01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:11.247
- Thank you.
That makes me happy.

01:17:11.281 --> 01:17:13.476
- Oh, it just makes me
want to be in a dance club.

01:17:13.516 --> 01:17:15.882
Only guys, though, no girls.

01:17:15.919 --> 01:17:18.479
Yeah, just guys
dancing everywhere.

01:17:18.521 --> 01:17:19.715
- [stammers]
Really?

01:17:19.756 --> 01:17:20.916
- Yeah.

01:17:20.957 --> 01:17:22.390
Definitely no chicks.

01:17:22.425 --> 01:17:24.393
This is a song just for guys.

01:17:24.427 --> 01:17:26.418
- Totally, totally.  Just dudes.

01:17:26.463 --> 01:17:28.761
- Okay.

01:17:28.798 --> 01:17:30.857
Okay.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.834
- [exhales]
Wow.

01:17:40.944 --> 01:17:48.942
? ?
