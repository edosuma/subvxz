WEBVTT

00:11.924 --> 00:14.405
WOMAN ON OH, NO!

00:14.449 --> 00:15.624
STOP!

00:15.667 --> 00:17.060
THIS IS TERRIFYING.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.149
THEY RELEASED THIS
TO THE PUBLIC?

00:19.193 --> 00:20.542
KEEP YOUR NASTY FEET
ON YOUR SIDE

00:20.585 --> 00:22.370
OF THE COUCH.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.459
FINE. JEEZ.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.851
CALL YOURSELF
A ROOMMATE.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.244
NO, I DON'T.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.333
I'M A MILITARY-TRAINED
BABYSITTER

00:29.377 --> 00:31.553
WHO MAKES SURE
YOU'RE RECEIVING
YOUR PROPER MEDS.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.472
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.171
SOMEONE'S
ON THE BALCONY.

00:47.482 --> 00:50.963
YOU DRANK MY PINOT?
I WAS SAVING THAT.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.792
I'M SORRY. IT DIDN'T
HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.056
IT'S MY DAMN HOUSE.
ASSUME EVERYTHING

00:56.099 --> 00:57.840
- HAS MY NAME ON IT.
- SHH!

00:57.883 --> 00:59.363
DO YOU
WANT THE PSYCHOTIC
SLASHER

00:59.407 --> 01:00.669
OUT THERE TO
HEAR US?

01:00.712 --> 01:02.236
GO.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.153
ON 3.

01:06.196 --> 01:09.025
1...2, 3.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.722
- UGH.
- AHH.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.076
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.599
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:17.642 --> 01:20.080
I'M HERE FOR HER.
GET DRESSED.

01:20.123 --> 01:24.606
OH. ACTUALLY, I'M
SUPERCOMFY HERE

01:24.649 --> 01:26.303
IN SOPHIE'S
EX-HUSBAND'S

01:26.347 --> 01:28.610
REALLY COOL
SPORTS TEE.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.264
RENEE INTERCEPTED
SOME 911 CALL

01:30.307 --> 01:32.570
WITH A LEAD
ON A POSSIBLE ROGUE WEAPON.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.964
GET YOUR ASS DRESSED.

01:38.837 --> 01:42.319
WELL, THIS
CERTAINLY MAKES SNUGGLING
WITH SOPHIE SEEM TAME.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.799
CAN YOU HAVE
A LITTLE RESPECT

01:43.842 --> 01:45.583
AND HELP ME
GET HIM DOWN?

01:45.627 --> 01:48.717
WHY ARE WE RUSHING?
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S DEAD ALREADY.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.154
YEAH. WELL, IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

01:51.198 --> 01:54.897
BEFORE GCPD SHOWS UP
AND TAKES OUR EVIDENCE.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.726
OH. PLEASE TELL ME
WE DON'T HAVE TO
RECOVER HIS UNDIES.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.989
JUST THE BINDINGS.

02:00.032 --> 02:04.124
RENEE THINKS THE CULPRIT
USED CATWOMAN'S BULLWHIP.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.039
AS IN ONE
OF THE BAT TROPHIES?

02:07.083 --> 02:10.173
WELL, THIS WAS EASY.
FOUND IT.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.349
CAN I PLEASE GO BACK
TO MY MOVIE NIGHT NOW?

02:12.393 --> 02:15.265
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS CATWOMAN'S WHIP.

02:15.309 --> 02:18.877
I DON'T CARE IF IT
BELONGED TO INDIANA JONES.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.315
IF RENEE THINKS IT IS,
LET HER,

02:21.358 --> 02:23.186
SO SHE CAN CROSS
ANOTHER WEAPON OFF HER LIST

02:23.230 --> 02:26.450
AND I CAN BE ONE STEP
CLOSER TO EARNING MY FREEDOM.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.630
ACCORDING TO LUKE,

02:32.674 --> 02:35.024
CATWOMAN AND BATMAN
HAD A THING.

02:35.067 --> 02:38.419
A THING? SO MUCH LEATHER.
HOW DID THAT WORK?

02:38.462 --> 02:40.377
WELL FOR HER.
SHE APPARENTLY STOLE

02:40.421 --> 02:42.379
SOME OF BATMAN'S
NANOTECH AND WOVE IT
INTO HER WHIP,

02:42.423 --> 02:43.989
MAKING IT
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.383
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
CUT WITH A POCKET KNIFE.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.472
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE
FROM MARY'S CLINIC
PICK UP THE BODY

02:48.516 --> 02:50.344
SO SHE CAN DO
A THOROUGH EXAM.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.824
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHO KILLED THIS GUY.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.000
AND YOU...PARTNER?

02:55.044 --> 02:56.872
I HAVE DINNER PLANS.

02:56.915 --> 02:59.614
RENEE LITERALLY HAS
THESE MISSIONS HANGING
OVER OUR HEADS.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.964
WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE
MORE IMPORTANT?

03:02.007 --> 03:04.445
SOMEONE WHO HAS
MUCH MORE HANGING
OVER MINE.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.839
MY MOTHER.

03:19.895 --> 03:23.594
NO, MRS. BAXTER.
I DID NOT USE YOUR
INVESTMENTS

03:23.638 --> 03:25.640
TO FUND A LUXURY
MUSIC FESTIVAL.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.207
WAYNE STOCK IS DOWN 53%,

03:27.250 --> 03:29.034
AND OUR CRISIS MANAGEMENT
TEAM JUST QUIT.

03:29.078 --> 03:33.648
AS CEO, I URGE YOU
PLEASE IGNORE THE TABLOIDS.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.432
I TOLD YOU
I WILL FIX THIS.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.042
YEAH. OK. WHEN?

03:37.086 --> 03:38.609
THE COMPANY'S IN THE RED
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

03:38.653 --> 03:40.089
AND YOU'VE BEEN ON NONSTOP
DAMAGE CONTROL

03:40.132 --> 03:41.482
FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.266
WHAT IS THIS?

03:43.310 --> 03:45.573
UH, ROOMIE, WHEN YOU
TOOK OUT THE TRASH THIS MORNING,

03:45.616 --> 03:49.794
YOU CLEARLY FORGOT
TO DUMP OUT JADA'S
DINNER PARTY INVITATION.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.275
IT CAME BY COURIER
YESTERDAY.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.408
UGH. OF COURSE SHE TURNS
AN EASY E-MAIL

03:54.451 --> 03:56.323
INTO A MASSIVE
CARBON FOOTPRINT.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.194
SHE JUST TANKED WAYNE.
WHY WOULD SHE EVER THINK

03:58.238 --> 04:00.196
THAT YOU'D WANT TO GO?

04:00.240 --> 04:03.199
GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT,
WON'T WE?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.940
YOU'RE GOING.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.899
ALICE FOUND EVIDENCE
LINKING JETURIAN
TO BLACK GLOVE.

04:07.943 --> 04:13.122
ALICE, WHO IS LITERALLY
HALLUCINATING SO BADLY

04:13.165 --> 04:15.516
THAT WE HAD TO PULL HER
OUT OF AN INSANE ASYLUM.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.474
OK. LOOK. WE NEED
TO FIND SOMETHING

04:17.518 --> 04:19.955
TO HANG OVER JADA'S HEAD
LIKE SHE HAS OVER MINE.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.827
UNTIL THEN, SHE WILL
ALWAYS HAVE US AT HER MERCY.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.656
WE NEED A SMOKING GUN,
SO WE BUG HER OFFICE

04:25.700 --> 04:27.267
AND SEE WHAT
WE FIND OUT.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.616
SHE'S NOT INVITING
YOU OVER TOP SHOW YOU

04:28.659 --> 04:30.182
HER SILK LINENS,
RYAN.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.532
SHE HAS AN AGENDA,

04:31.575 --> 04:33.098
AND IF SHE WAS ABLE
TO UNCOVER

04:33.142 --> 04:35.144
WAYNE'S HIDDEN
ACCOUNTS...

04:48.810 --> 04:51.726
SORRY. WHAT WAS I SAYING?

04:51.769 --> 04:54.250
"IF SHE WAS ABLE
TO UNCOVER WAYNE'S
HIDDEN ACCOUNTS"...

04:54.294 --> 04:56.905
EXACTLY. THEN WHO'S
TO SAY SHE CAN'T

04:56.948 --> 04:58.689
UNCOVER YOUR
HIDDEN IDENTITY, TOO?

04:58.733 --> 05:02.171
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I NEED TO BE CAREFUL,

05:02.214 --> 05:04.391
WHICH IS WHY I'M
BRINGING BACKUP.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.131
SO YOU'RE
RYAN'S DATE?

05:06.175 --> 05:09.134
SO SAW THAT COMING.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.833
IT'S NOT A DATE.
IT'S RECON.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.443
BUT YOU'RE WEARING
A PUSH-UP BRA,

05:13.487 --> 05:15.358
SO IT'S A DATE.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.099
YOU KNOW THIS IS
YOUR FAULT, RIGHT?

05:17.142 --> 05:19.493
UGH. DON'T BLAME ME
FOR THIS REPULSIVE
LOVE AFFAIR.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.364
IF YOU'D NEVER TOLD
RYAN THAT

05:21.408 --> 05:23.235
HER BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
WAS STILL ALIVE,

05:23.279 --> 05:24.889
WE WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS MESS.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.544
SOPH, THE GUILT I THINK
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE FEELING

05:27.588 --> 05:31.026
IS SERIOUSLY KILLING
MY HALLUCINATION-FREE VIBES.

05:31.069 --> 05:34.290
SERIOUSLY, FOR
THE LAST...3 DAYS,

05:34.334 --> 05:37.859
IT'S JUST BEEN ME,
MYSELF, AND I.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.295
THE MEDS ARE WORKING.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.558
CRAZY ALICE
IS CRAZY NO MORE.

05:41.602 --> 05:42.864
DON'T POKE THE BEAR.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.434
TELL ME THAT YOU
HEAR THAT.

05:47.477 --> 05:51.351
IT'S YOUR PHONE.
IT'S MONTOYA.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.658
UGH. SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE.
I AM ON VACATION.

05:54.702 --> 05:57.487
OH, NO. YOU'RE
A CRIMINAL WHO'S
ON WORK RELEASE,

05:57.531 --> 06:01.709
AND SHE SAID TO GET
YOUR ASS TO HER OFFICE NOW.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.936
MAY I OFFER YOU
A BEVERAGE WHILE
YOU WAIT?

06:11.980 --> 06:14.852
THE MADAM RECOMMENDS
A 1994 COTE DES BLANCS.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.507
- WE'RE GOOD.
- VERY WELL.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.858
MADAM JET WILL BE
DOWN SHORTLY.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.817
"MADAM JET WILL BE
DOWN SHORTLY."

06:22.860 --> 06:24.819
IS SHE FOR REAL?

06:24.862 --> 06:27.648
AS REAL AS THE BLING
IN HER CHANDELIER.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.432
I FEEL LIKE
THE FOSTER KID

06:29.476 --> 06:31.303
WHO ISN'T ALLOWED TO
SIT ON ANYTHING.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.740
THAT'S THE POINT.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.045
THIS IS
AN INTIMIDATION MOVE

06:34.089 --> 06:35.612
TO GET IN YOUR HEAD,
MAKE YOU THINK

06:35.656 --> 06:37.353
YOU HAVE NOTHING
AND SHE'S GOT
EVERYTHING.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.789
THAT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO HARD CONSIDERING

06:38.833 --> 06:41.183
MY LAST ADDRESS
WAS MY LICENSE PLATE.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.624
RYAN, I'M GLAD
YOU COULD COME.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.583
AHH. I SEE YOU BROUGHT
A FRIEND.

06:50.932 --> 06:54.022
GIRLFRIEND ACTUALLY.

06:54.065 --> 06:57.199
- SOPHIE. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YOU, AS WELL.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.375
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
MADAM.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.769
THE CHEF ASSURES ME
HE HAS THINGS
COVERED HERE.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.553
GREAT. GOOD NIGHT,
DAMIEN.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.468
ON YOUR WAY OUT,
WOULD YOU PLEASE
INFORM HIM

07:05.512 --> 07:06.991
THAT WE'LL BE
HAVING ANOTHER?

07:07.035 --> 07:08.297
YES, MADAM.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.483
- CHEF.
- HMM?

07:20.527 --> 07:22.137
THE MADAM HAS
REQUESTED PREPARATIONS

07:22.180 --> 07:23.617
FOR ANOTHER GUEST.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.532
OH. THE MORE
THE MERRIER.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.283
THERE, THERE, LITTLE PIG.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.985
UNH!

07:45.813 --> 07:48.468
TIME FOR THE PROFESSOR
TO TEACH THE CLASS

07:48.511 --> 07:50.295
HOW TO SQUEAL.

07:50.339 --> 07:53.951
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

07:58.521 --> 08:00.218
SO HOW DID
YOU TWO MEET?

08:00.262 --> 08:02.525
RYAN AND
THROUGH FRIENDS.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.353
WAS IT A TUESDAY?

08:04.396 --> 08:07.661
DEFINITELY BECAUSE
IT WAS, UH...

08:07.704 --> 08:09.706
TACO NIGHT.

08:09.750 --> 08:13.841
AND...YOU OFFERED
TO BUY ME A DRINK

08:13.884 --> 08:15.843
TO WASH DOWN THE CHIPS.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.758
THE CHIPS. HEH.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.455
UH, YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE CORNER

08:19.499 --> 08:21.065
OF THE CHIP GETS STUCK
IN THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.546
YEAH. JUST THE COUGHING,
CHOKING, WATERY EYES.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.635
I MEAN, I THINK THERE
WAS SWEAT INVOLVED.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.116
- SOUNDS ROMANTIC.
- IT WASN'T CUTE,

08:28.159 --> 08:29.596
BUT THAT'S THE POINT.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.990
I MEAN...SOMEONE SEES YOU
AT YOUR NOT CUTEST

08:33.034 --> 08:34.905
AND STILL ASKS YOU OUT?

08:34.949 --> 08:36.298
I MEAN, AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

08:36.341 --> 08:38.561
WE JUST WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S LOYAL.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.998
I KNOW THAT
IF I WERE DYING

08:41.042 --> 08:42.739
SOPHIE WOULD SIT
BESIDE ME,

08:42.783 --> 08:44.175
PUT HER ARMS AROUND ME,
AND TELL ME

08:44.219 --> 08:45.916
EVERYTHING WOULD BE OK.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.009
EXCUSE ME. BATHROOM?

08:52.053 --> 08:53.663
LAST ROOM
DOWN THE HALL.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.104
WE SHOULD ALL BE
SO LUCKY.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.758
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.368
HMM. YEAH.

09:07.677 --> 09:11.333
NOW LET'S GET UGLY.
WHY AM I HERE?

09:11.376 --> 09:13.465
IF THIS IS YOUR
OLIVE BRANCH

09:13.509 --> 09:15.337
FOR DESTROYING MY COMPANY,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED

09:15.380 --> 09:17.600
A DAMN ORCHARD.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.471
I COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN MORE CLEAR

09:19.515 --> 09:21.430
WHEN I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.780
AND NOW I'M
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM,

09:23.824 --> 09:25.608
SO WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

09:25.652 --> 09:28.306
WHATEVER'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND MARQUIS

09:28.350 --> 09:29.873
NEEDS TO STOP.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.179
WHO SAYS SOMETHING'S
GOING ON?

09:31.222 --> 09:33.834
A MOTHER ALWAYS KNOWS.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.749
NOW I NEED YOU TO
ASK YOUR GIRL TO LEAVE

09:35.792 --> 09:37.838
SO I CAN GET REAL
WITH YOU.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.928
GET REAL? RICH COMING
FROM THE WOMAN

09:40.971 --> 09:42.494
WHO CONVINCED ME
SHE WAS DEAD.

09:42.538 --> 09:45.846
HMM. DYING WILL BE
THE EASY PART, RYAN,

09:45.889 --> 09:47.848
FOR YOU AND A LOT
OF FOLKS

09:47.891 --> 09:50.546
IF YOU DON'T DO
EXACTLY WHAT I SAY.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.854
YO! NOBODY
AT THE DOOR?

09:53.897 --> 09:55.812
WHERE'S MY MAN DAMIEN?

09:55.856 --> 09:57.553
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT KIND OF PSYCHO

09:57.597 --> 09:59.773
MIGHT COME WALTZING
INTO THIS PLACE.

09:59.816 --> 10:03.254
MARQUIS, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

10:03.298 --> 10:05.822
HEARD THERE WAS
A FAMILY DINNER.

10:11.698 --> 10:12.829
SOPHIE,
BATCAVE.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.091
COPY.
ARE YOU IN?

10:15.832 --> 10:18.269
10 BEDROOMS
AND 15 BATHROOMS LATER,

10:18.313 --> 10:19.967
I FOUND HER STUDY.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.316
OK. GOOD. FIND
SOMEWHERE CENTRAL

10:21.359 --> 10:23.100
AWAY FROM A.C. VENTS,
SHREDDERS,

10:23.144 --> 10:25.973
ANYTHING THAT
CREATES NOISE.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.931
ALL RIGHT.
I'M AT HER DESK.
FIRE IT UP.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.981
TESTING 1, 2, 3.

10:34.024 --> 10:37.245
ALL RIGHT. WE ARE UP.
NOW GET OUT OF THERE.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.813
I WILL
IN TWO SECONDS.

10:39.856 --> 10:43.120
SOPHIE, I STRONGLY
SUGGEST THAT YOU GET
OUT OF THERE.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.614
LOOKS LIKE RYAN WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE

10:58.658 --> 11:01.748
CUT OUT OF THE FAMILY.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.315
I'M GONNA SEND YOU A FACE
TO RUN THROUGH REC.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.491
AH. GO FOR IT.
STANDING BY.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.974
SOPHIE?

11:11.018 --> 11:12.584
LUKE, DO YOU COPY?

11:12.628 --> 11:14.282
HEY. HEY, SOPHIE.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.374
LUKE, DO YOU COPY?

11:24.074 --> 11:26.816
THE POWDER ROOM'S
ON THE FIRST FLOOR,
HONEY.

11:26.860 --> 11:30.690
BIG HOUSE. GOT LOST.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.387
DINNER'S READY.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.094
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A SECRET PARTNERSHIP,

11:44.138 --> 11:45.574
AND YOU'RE SITTING
THERE HAVING SECRET
DINNERS WITH HER?

11:45.617 --> 11:46.793
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.708
I HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.361
SHE ALREADY KNOWS
ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.711
HOW?

11:56.803 --> 11:59.588
CAN WE PLEASE EAT
BEFORE ANY MORE GUESTS ARRIVE?

12:12.079 --> 12:14.168
SO SHE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S A TROPHY.

12:14.211 --> 12:17.780
OH, SOMETHING ABOUT
BATMAN AND CATWOMAN
BETWEEN THE SHEETS.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.740
PERSONALLY, I DIDN'T
THINK HEROES DID
THAT SORT OF THING,

12:20.783 --> 12:23.090
BUT, UH, WHAT DO I KNOW?

12:23.133 --> 12:25.483
I'M A VILLAIN.

12:25.527 --> 12:28.748
THEN PROVE ME WRONG.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.271
OHH. THIS IS A RECORD
OF EVERY ROGUE

12:30.314 --> 12:32.099
THAT'S TORMENTED GOTHAM.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.840
IF IT'S NOT
A CATWOMAN WANNABE,

12:33.883 --> 12:36.320
THEN USE THAT
BEAUTIFULLY
DEMENTED MIND

12:36.364 --> 12:38.409
AND TELL ME WHO
WOULD STRING UP

12:38.453 --> 12:41.238
A NAKED MAN
IN AN AUTO SHOP
WITH A BULLWHIP.

12:51.118 --> 12:56.253
MAGPIE--NOT POSSIBLE.
TOO MANY SHINY PIERCINGS
LEFT ON THE VICTIM.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.343
SHELLY GAYNOR...
AKA THE WHIP.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.910
SOUNDS PROMISING.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.739
MMM...NO.
ANIMAL ADVOCATE.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.655
HER WHIP WAS
FAUX LEATHER.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.178
HMM.

13:08.222 --> 13:11.225
WELL, THIS ONE IS
KINKIER THAN A GARDEN HOSE,

13:11.268 --> 13:15.142
BUT, UM, TALIA AL GHUL
IS FAR TOO IMPATIENT

13:15.185 --> 13:17.144
FOR PERFORMATIVE
VICTIM STAGING.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.066
I THINK WE FOUND OUR GIRL--

13:26.109 --> 13:29.809
MANIPULATIVE, OBSESSIVE,
BACKSTABBING.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.288
WHO IS SHE?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.249
YOU.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.036
WHAT'S WITH YOUR
CREEPY OBSESSION
WITH POISON IVY?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.169
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:42.212 --> 13:46.869
MMM. HEH. YOUR CASE FILES
ON EVERYONE ELSE ARE...ANEMIC,

13:46.913 --> 13:48.828
BUT THIS ONE
ON PAM ISLEY READS

13:48.871 --> 13:51.787
LIKE YOU'RE, UH, PLANNING
ON WRITING A BIOPIC--

13:51.831 --> 13:55.225
JUICY INTERVIEWS,
DETAILED FACT SHEETS.

13:55.269 --> 13:59.751
OHH! A CONFIDENTIAL
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.101
TSK, TSK, TSK, TSK.

14:01.144 --> 14:04.495
NOW YOU NEED TO PROVE
ME WRONG.

14:04.539 --> 14:08.499
ARE BATWOMAN AND I
LOOKING FOR THESE WEAPONS
OF MASS DESTRUCTION

14:08.543 --> 14:10.240
TO STOP CRIMINALS?

14:10.284 --> 14:13.678
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
YOU BROUGHT US TOGETHER

14:13.722 --> 14:17.378
TO FIND ONE VINY VIXEN
IN PARTICULAR.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.568
ANYBODY ELSE FEEL
A LITTLE SORRY
FOR THAT THING?

14:33.611 --> 14:37.485
ROASTED SUCKLING IS
CONSIDERED A DELICACY
IN MOST OF THE WORLD.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.791
I'M VEGAN,
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER

14:39.835 --> 14:41.576
WHAT CONTINENT
MY ASS IS ON.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.447
I'M NOT TOUCHING
THAT.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.146
PERHAPS MORE WINE
WILL ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.496
OUR ESTEEMED CHEF FLEW
FROM METROPOLIS

14:48.539 --> 14:49.889
TO COOK FOR US.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.281
HE COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.676
SO IF I MAY,

14:54.719 --> 14:56.156
YOU'RE THE ESTRANGED
DAUGHTER

14:56.199 --> 14:57.984
WHO JUST RECENTLY BONDED
WITH YOUR BROTHER,

14:58.027 --> 15:00.029
BUT THAT'S BAD BECAUSE
HE HAS A CODEPENDENT
RELATIONSHIP

15:00.073 --> 15:02.510
WITH HIS MOTHER,
WHO NOW SEES YOU
AS A THREAT

15:02.553 --> 15:04.686
TO HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER SON.

15:04.729 --> 15:07.732
ZOEY'S
DISSERTATION IS ON
MODERN FAMILY DYNAMICS.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.909
PARTICULARLY TRIANGULATION
AS IT RELATES

15:09.952 --> 15:11.606
TO BOWEN'S FAMILY
THEORY PARADIGM--

15:11.649 --> 15:14.043
RESCUER, VICTIM,
PERSECUTOR.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.872
THAT'S INTERESTING.
DOES BOWEN HAVE A TERM

15:16.916 --> 15:19.179
FOR BACKSTABBING
SISTERS?

15:21.877 --> 15:24.401
UH, I NEED THE LADIES'.
TANNINS GO RIGHT THROUGH ME.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.795
- BACKSTABBING SISTERS?
- MM-HMM.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.232
I WASN'T THE ONE
WHO ORCHESTRATED
THIS WHOLE DINNER.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.278
JADA DID.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.019
WAS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?

15:33.062 --> 15:35.673
MARQUIS FINDS OUT
I'M HAVING DINNER
WITH HIS MOM,

15:35.717 --> 15:37.501
SO HE STOPS TRUSTING ME.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.460
IF WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT TRUST,

15:39.503 --> 15:41.375
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND THOUGHT

15:41.418 --> 15:43.377
SHE WAS GOING TO FIND
IN MY STUDY.

15:45.205 --> 15:48.556
EXACTLY. SO DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT HAVING AN AGENDA.

15:51.559 --> 15:55.258
YOU'RE RIGHT, JADA.
I DID COME HERE
WITH AN AGENDA.

15:55.302 --> 15:58.218
I CAME TO SAY THANK YOU.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.524
THANK YOU FOR
GIVING ME UP.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.309
THANK YOU FOR WALKING AWAY

16:02.352 --> 16:03.919
AND LETTING ME BE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM

16:03.963 --> 16:06.530
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET
THE BUTLERS

16:06.574 --> 16:10.273
OR THE 5-COURSE MEAL
OR THE MANSION.

16:10.317 --> 16:14.190
I GOT A HOME. I GOT LOVE.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.149
I GOT A REAL MOTHER.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.857
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, ZOEY.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.251
WINE AND FAMILY DRAMA
DO NOT MIX.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.868
WHY CAN'T I FEEL ANYTHING?

16:50.139 --> 16:51.793
TURN THE FAUCET, ZOEY.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.107
AAH!

17:06.808 --> 17:07.983
GOT TO SAY
I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET

17:08.027 --> 17:11.465
MY BABY SISTER WIN
BEST SPEECH OF THE NIGHT.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.597
MARQUIS, HAVEN'T WE
HAD ENOUGH THEATRICS
FOR ONE EVENING?

17:13.641 --> 17:15.077
DON'T WORRY.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.645
I'LL KEEP IT SIMPLE.

17:17.688 --> 17:21.127
TO FAMILY
AND LOYALTY.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.615
- YOU OK?
- WHAT?

17:31.659 --> 17:33.139
I CAN'T MOVE
MY ARMS.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.491
RELAX.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.455
JUST A LITTLE PARALYTIC.

17:45.499 --> 17:46.978
YOU MON--

17:47.022 --> 17:49.024
OK. MAYBE A LOT
OF PARALYTIC.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.245
GET AWAY FROM US.

17:52.288 --> 17:55.117
YOU'RE NOT AN EASY
WOMAN TO GET ALONE.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.684
PRACTICALLY HAD TO
CONVINCE YOU

17:56.727 --> 17:59.774
I WAS ROYALTY TO GET
THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.

18:03.256 --> 18:06.476
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
MRS. JET?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.043
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU ARE.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.740
DO YOU REALLY FIRE
SO MANY PEOPLE

18:09.784 --> 18:11.481
THEY'RE ALL A BLUR?

18:11.525 --> 18:14.223
LAZLO VALENTIN.
I WAS A CHEF

18:14.267 --> 18:16.225
IN THE DINING HALL
AT YOUR OFFICE

18:16.269 --> 18:18.271
UNTIL YOU FIRED ME.

18:18.314 --> 18:21.752
VALENTIN. OK.
I REMEMBER THE NAME.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.103
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER?

18:24.146 --> 18:26.105
TELLING MY FAMILY,

18:26.148 --> 18:28.933
"HEY, GUYS.
NO MORE MONEY'S
COMING IN FOR A WHILE.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.674
"BOSS LADY HATES
DADDY'S COOKING,

18:30.718 --> 18:33.329
SO NOW NOBODY WANTS
TO HIRE HIM ANYMORE."

18:33.373 --> 18:35.331
YEAH, AND I REMEMBER
THE DIVORCE PAPERS,

18:35.375 --> 18:37.551
THE DEBT COLLECTORS,
THE REPO MAN.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.292
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE REMEMBERS

18:39.335 --> 18:41.120
THE DAMN COOK
FROM THE BUILDING CAF?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.730
- MARQUIS.
- NAW. YOU PROBABLY SAID

18:42.773 --> 18:46.125
THE FOOD SUCKED,
YOUR STAFF REPLACED
HIS ASS.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.083
IT'S JUST BUSINESS, BRO.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.606
JUST BUSINESS?!

18:49.650 --> 18:51.956
I LOST MY FAMILY
BECAUSE OF HER,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.046
SO NOW YOU'LL
LOSE YOURS.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.179
YOU TOLD MARQUIS
ABOUT THIS DINNER.

18:57.223 --> 19:01.270
HOW ELSE COULD YOU
WATCH ME CHOP HIM
INTO BACON BITS?

19:02.489 --> 19:05.883
BUT THE UNEXPECTED
DAUGHTER--HA HA HA!

19:05.927 --> 19:07.929
TALK ABOUT
AN AMUSE-BOUCHE.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.236
- HUH!
- AGH!

19:10.279 --> 19:11.846
AAH! UGH!

19:14.675 --> 19:17.373
MARQUIS, COME ON.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.246
I CAN'T--I CAN'T MOVE.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.770
ZOEY--SHE'S STILL
UPSTAIRS.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.076
I GOT HIM. GO.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.253
I'LL FIND ZOEY.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.646
GET OUTSIDE.
CALL FOR HELP.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.387
I GOT YOU. COME ON.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.888
ZOEY. ZOEY, WE GOT TO GO.

20:01.722 --> 20:02.984
AAH!

20:05.813 --> 20:08.076
IT WON'T OPEN.
WHY WON'T IT OPEN?

20:08.119 --> 20:10.209
HE MUST HAVE LOCKED US
IN FROM THE OUTSIDE.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.912
MY PHONE HAS NO SERVICE.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.870
MINE EITHER.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.264
WHICH LITTLE PIGGY
WENT TO MARKET?

20:22.308 --> 20:25.572
WHICH LITTLE PIGGY
SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME?

20:25.615 --> 20:27.835
UPSTAIRS. FOLLOW ME.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.796
GO.
GO WITHOUT ME.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.582
NO, MARQUIS. COME ON.
YOU CAN DO THIS. LET'S GO.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.149
AHH! UNH!

20:45.418 --> 20:46.723
AAH! UNH!

20:48.943 --> 20:50.640
A LESSON FROM
PROFESSOR PYG!

20:50.684 --> 20:53.600
NOBODY LIKES
AN UNINVITED GUEST!

20:53.643 --> 20:55.428
HYAH! UNH!

20:55.471 --> 20:56.777
UNH! OHH!

20:58.953 --> 21:00.781
COME ON. COME ON!

21:29.070 --> 21:30.332
ERRR!

21:30.376 --> 21:31.942
HUH!

21:31.986 --> 21:33.814
ERR! HA HA HA!

21:37.252 --> 21:39.602
I'LL HUFF,
AND I'LL PUFF

21:39.646 --> 21:43.389
AND BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!

21:44.955 --> 21:48.045
HE'S GONE...FOR NOW.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.876
ZOEY'S DEAD.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.096
OH, MY GOD.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.489
AND HE'S NOT LEAVING
THIS HOUSE

21:56.532 --> 21:58.969
UNTIL WE ARE, TOO.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.366
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

22:04.410 --> 22:06.325
IT'S A PANIC ROOM.
I CONVERTED ONE

22:06.368 --> 22:08.762
OF MY CLOSETS
A FEW YEARS BACK.

22:08.805 --> 22:11.808
YOU MUST HAVE A LOT
OF ENEMIES.

22:11.852 --> 22:14.724
SECRET CLOSET SPACE
AND ALL.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.247
SIGNAL'S DEAD.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.075
I HAD A CALL
DROP EARLIER.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.295
HE MUST HAVE ACTIVATED
SOME SORT OF...

22:20.339 --> 22:23.385
SIGNAL BLOCKER.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.996
TELL ME YOU HAVE
A GUN IN HERE.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.565
UH-UH. I DON'T
BELIEVE IN GUNS.

22:29.609 --> 22:32.612
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOT TORTUROUS ENOUGH?

22:32.655 --> 22:34.091
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

22:34.135 --> 22:37.138
EVERYBODY,
JUST CHILL, OK?

22:37.181 --> 22:38.966
SOMEONE WILL EVENTUALLY
REALIZE WE'RE MISSING

22:39.009 --> 22:40.402
AND COME LOOKING
FOR US.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.622
WE JUST NEED
TO HANG UNTIL THEN.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.713
MARQUIS?

22:50.891 --> 22:55.199
MARQUIS! MARQUIS! MARQUIS!
MARQUIS!

22:58.638 --> 23:00.727
PAMELA AND I
MET AT GOTHAM U.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.250
I WAS STUDYING
CRIMINAL LAW.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.557
SHE WAS INTO BOTANY,
COMPLETE OPPOSITES,

23:04.600 --> 23:08.517
BUT COULDN'T
SEE A FUTURE
WITHOUT THE OTHER.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.519
- LOVE THAT.
- AT THE SAME TIME,

23:10.563 --> 23:12.260
ONE OF HER CLASSMATES
WAS CONDUCTING

23:12.303 --> 23:15.306
THESE OBSESSIVE
EXPERIMENTS FOR HIS Ph.D.

23:15.350 --> 23:18.266
HE AND PAM WERE
COMPETITIVE,

23:18.309 --> 23:20.442
BOTH SUPERSMART,
KIND OF NERDY.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.009
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
HARMLESS UNTIL ONE NIGHT

23:22.052 --> 23:25.316
HE ABDUCTED PAM AND USED
HER AS HIS GUINEA PIG.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.015
LET ME GUESS--
THAT'D BE MARC LeGRAND.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.234
WHATEVER HE INJECTED
HER WITH WAS POISON,

23:30.278 --> 23:33.063
SOME AWFUL COMBINATION
OF THINGS AROUND HIS LAB--

23:33.107 --> 23:36.415
OLEANDER, NIGHTSHADE,
WATER HEMLOCK.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.373
CHANGED HER ENTIRE
PHYSIOLOGY.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.506
TURNED HER INTO
A GREEN-THUMBED PSYCHO.

23:40.549 --> 23:41.942
SHE DIDN'T SEE IT
THAT WAY.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.509
SHE WANTED TO SAVE
THE PLANET,

23:43.552 --> 23:46.381
AND THAT MEANT
PUNISHING ANYONE
DESTROYING IT.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.122
EXCEPT
AN UP-AND-COMING COP

23:48.165 --> 23:50.472
SHACKING UP
WITH A SERIAL KILLER

23:50.516 --> 23:54.824
KIND OF PUTS A CRAMP
IN THE OLD CAREER TRAJECTORY.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.696
SHE WENT FROM
COMPASSIONATE AND LOVING

23:56.739 --> 23:58.872
TO RECKLESS AND IRRATIONAL
OVERNIGHT.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.482
TOTAL PERSONALITY
CHANGE.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.397
IT EVENTUALLY JUST
TORE US APART.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.530
SUBTEXT--YOU CHOSE
YOUR CAREER OVER YOUR GIRL.

24:04.573 --> 24:07.402
SHE WAS LOST...OK?

24:07.446 --> 24:11.362
GONE. EMOTIONALLY,
MENTALLY A SHELL
OF THE PERSON I KNEW,

24:11.406 --> 24:12.886
AND I--I WAS YOUNG.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.322
I HAD NO IDEA
HOW TO SAVE HER.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.759
OH, RELAX. I'M NOT
ACTUALLY INVESTED

24:16.803 --> 24:18.369
IN YOUR LOVE STORY.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.807
SO WHERE'S POISON PAM?

24:20.850 --> 24:22.722
THAT'S A QUESTION
FOR BATMAN.

24:22.765 --> 24:26.465
WELL, SHE'S NOT
IN ARKHAM--I WOULD KNOW--

24:26.508 --> 24:29.511
AND BORING BATMAN DIDN'T
ACTUALLY KILL ANYONE,

24:29.555 --> 24:34.037
SO UNLESS SHE SLITHERED
UP JACK'S BEANSTALK...

24:34.081 --> 24:36.475
MY THEORY IS HE
HID HER UNDER
THE CITY SOMEWHERE

24:36.518 --> 24:37.954
AWAY FROM WATER
AND SUNLIGHT

24:37.998 --> 24:39.739
AND ANYONE
SHE COULD HURT.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.568
WHY WOULD BATMAN BURY
YOUR GIRLFRIEND ALIVE?

24:44.265 --> 24:46.006
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM TO.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.623
THIS SHOULDN'T
BE HAPPENING.

24:57.191 --> 24:58.671
WHAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN?

25:00.760 --> 25:03.937
THIS LONG, SAPPY TANGENT,

25:03.980 --> 25:07.984
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S
A POTENTIAL SADIST
ON THE LOOSE.

25:08.028 --> 25:11.422
I'M GOING TO GO SEE
OUR MEDICAL EXPERT

25:11.466 --> 25:13.816
AND SEE IF SHE FOUND
ANYTHING ON THE VIC'S BODY.

25:20.823 --> 25:23.304
DRINK THE WATER, MARQUIS.

25:23.347 --> 25:26.220
WE'RE GONNA
MAKE SURE SHE'S OK.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.962
HE DRANK THE MOST,
SO IT'S HITTING HIM FIRST,

25:29.005 --> 25:33.532
BUT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE IT'S ALL OF US.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.969
OK, OK.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.579
65 OVER 30.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.146
THAT'S BAD.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.800
IF IT KEEPS DROPPING,
HE'S GONNA DIE.

25:40.843 --> 25:43.063
- HE NEEDS ADRENALINE.
- I KNOW.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.847
THERE'S NONE IN HERE.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.327
THERE ARE EPIPENS.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.763
MY HUSBAND CARRIED THEM
FOR HIS ALLERGIES.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.113
- WHERE?
- WITH OUR CAMPING GEAR.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.593
IN THE BASEMENT.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.600
TELL ME THERE'S
ANOTHER WAY TO GET
INTO THE BASEMENT.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.428
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING?

26:00.471 --> 26:01.821
BUILDING A BOMB.

26:05.781 --> 26:07.391
I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.485
OHH.

26:14.529 --> 26:15.878
COME ON.

26:24.234 --> 26:28.456
LAZLO.
LAZLO, WHERE ARE YOU?

26:28.499 --> 26:30.589
LAZLO, I WANT A TRUCE.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.286
YOU NEED MONEY?
HOW MUCH?

26:32.329 --> 26:33.722
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.158
LET'S TALK.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.339
LAZLO, I'M SORRY.

26:42.383 --> 26:43.993
I REALLY AM.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.413
RAH! OHH!

27:12.456 --> 27:14.067
UNH!

27:17.723 --> 27:18.985
AGH!

27:44.401 --> 27:47.013
IT WASN'T PRETTY,
BUT SHE MADE IT.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.625
SO ARE YOU REALLY
RYAN'S GIRLFRIEND,

27:50.669 --> 27:53.062
OR WAS THAT A LIE,
TOO?

27:53.106 --> 27:55.195
WANT TO KNOW WHO
I REALLY AM?

27:57.806 --> 28:01.680
I'M JORDAN MOORE'S SISTER.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.203
I'M SORRY.
I'M LIGHTHEADED.

28:03.246 --> 28:06.162
AM I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW WHO THAT IS?

28:06.206 --> 28:08.991
YOUR MEN ABDUCTED HER

28:09.035 --> 28:12.778
AND INJECTED HER
WITH FREEZE SERUM,

28:12.821 --> 28:14.910
KILLED 3 OF HER FRIENDS,

28:14.954 --> 28:16.477
NEARLY KILLED HER.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.305
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

28:18.348 --> 28:20.742
STOP!

28:20.786 --> 28:22.309
DON'T TELL ME YOU
DIDN'T KNOW

28:22.352 --> 28:24.833
ABOUT HUMAN EXPERIMENTS
BEING CONDUCTED

28:24.877 --> 28:27.270
BY YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES.

28:29.098 --> 28:32.798
SO IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE DOING IN MY STUDY,

28:32.841 --> 28:34.974
LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE?

28:35.017 --> 28:36.802
WHAT'D YOU FIND,
SOPHIE,

28:36.845 --> 28:39.630
"THE ANARCHIST
COOKBOOK"?

28:39.674 --> 28:43.286
LOOK. I AM SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SISTER,

28:43.330 --> 28:46.942
BUT I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.902
I'M NOT THE MONSTER
YOU'VE MADE ME OUT TO BE.

28:57.257 --> 29:01.130
STAY WITH ME, SON.
MAMA'S HERE.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.361
OHH.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.058
OF COURSE.

29:18.539 --> 29:19.932
PROFESSOR COME ON!

30:00.842 --> 30:02.713
OK. OK.

30:02.757 --> 30:05.107
COME ON, RYAN.
MOVE YOUR ARM.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.283
MOVE YOUR DAMN...ARM!

30:07.327 --> 30:08.676
UNH!

30:10.634 --> 30:11.853
COME ON, COME ON.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.118
COME...ON.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.311
VIC HAD
MOTORCYCLE GREASE

30:35.355 --> 30:36.747
UNDERNEATH HIS FINGERNAILS.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.576
I FOUND A SIMILAR
BUT NOT EXACT VISCOUS SYNTHETIC

30:39.620 --> 30:42.623
ON THE BULLWHIP.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.973
FASCINATING.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.410
WHAT'S WITH
THE BOTANICAL GARDEN?

30:47.454 --> 30:50.239
OH, DID THE MEDICAL
BOARD TAKE AWAY
YOUR LICENSE

30:50.283 --> 30:54.591
AND LEAVE YOU
TO THE WHIMS
OF HERBAL MEDICINE.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.246
DO YOU KNOW HOW I SAVED
JORDAN MOORE'S LIFE?

30:57.290 --> 30:59.074
- NO.
- I MIMICKED THE ANTIFREEZE

30:59.118 --> 31:01.076
SYNTHESIS DONE BY PLANTS
TO SURVIVE

31:01.120 --> 31:02.773
SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.253
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

31:04.297 --> 31:06.255
BECAUSE PLANTS ARE
SMARTER THAN HUMANS.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.779
THEY'RE RESILIENT,
THEY'RE INTUITIVE,

31:08.823 --> 31:10.738
THEY GIVE BACK MORE
THAN THEY TAKE.

31:10.781 --> 31:15.308
GOT IT. JEEZ.
SORRY I ASKED.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.658
ANYWAY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE BEING

31:17.701 --> 31:20.574
ALL HERO COMPLEXY
AND TOLD ME BECAUSE

31:20.617 --> 31:23.446
YOU'RE A OFFICIAL
DOCTOR NOW IT IS
YOUR DUTY

31:23.490 --> 31:25.709
TO HELP ME
WHEN THE TIME COMES?

31:25.753 --> 31:29.365
WELL...THAT TIME
IS UPON US.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.849
THE DELUSIONS ARE BACK.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.724
BETWEEN THE...INMATES
IN ARKHAM,

31:40.768 --> 31:44.119
THE EXPERIMENTAL MEDS,
THE GENERAL MISE EN SCEÈNE
OF CAPTIVITY,

31:44.163 --> 31:48.123
I ASSUMED IT WAS
THE ASYLUM THAT WAS
MAKING ME CRAZY.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.434
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I HAVE ENJOYED

31:54.477 --> 31:57.654
MY FAIR SHARE
OF DISASSOCIATION.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.656
YOU'RE TALKING
TO THE GIRL WHO
CONVINCED HERSELF

31:59.700 --> 32:02.268
THAT 12 YEARS
OF SEWING SKIN MASKS

32:02.311 --> 32:03.965
WAS A FANCY TEA PARTY.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.882
BUT I WAS
IN CONTROL THEN.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.406
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

32:10.450 --> 32:14.106
I'M NOT IN CONTROL
ANYMORE.

32:14.149 --> 32:18.849
AS IF WHAT'S HAPPENING
ISN'T OBVIOUS?

32:18.893 --> 32:21.200
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW,
ALICE.

32:21.243 --> 32:24.377
ALL OF THE MURDERS,
THE PAIN, THE MISERY

32:24.420 --> 32:27.771
THAT YOU'VE INFLICTED,
THEY WERE THE SEEDS
THAT YOU PLANTED

32:27.815 --> 32:29.904
FOR THE GARDEN
YOU'LL BE BURIED IN.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.780
GOT IT.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.837
SPEAKING OF GARDENS,

32:49.880 --> 32:51.926
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
FROLICKING?

32:51.970 --> 32:53.536
GOTHAM PARK.

32:53.580 --> 32:57.149
I THINK I EXPOSED MYSELF
TO WHATEVER THAT THING IS.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.629
OHH. I TOOK A SAMPLE
OF THE VINE,

32:59.673 --> 33:03.068
BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
IF IT'S POISON OAK,

33:03.111 --> 33:05.287
POISON SUMAC, POISON HEMLOCK.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.506
POISON IVY.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.813
LET ME IN!

33:09.857 --> 33:11.685
OH, MY GOD.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.034
HE'S GOT RYAN.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.168
OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW!

33:16.211 --> 33:19.301
BUT HE WANTS YOU.

33:19.345 --> 33:24.002
IF I OPEN THIS DOOR,
I'M AS GOOD AS DEAD.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.742
UGH.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.234
YOUR LESSON IS

33:39.278 --> 33:42.063
THAT WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU
WHO THEY ARE BELIEVE THEM

33:42.107 --> 33:43.891
BECAUSE IF I'M HOW SHE
TREATS THE PEOPLE

33:43.934 --> 33:45.849
SPENDING THEIR DAYS
TRYING TO IMPRESS HER,

33:45.893 --> 33:49.070
GUESS HOW SHE'LL TREAT
SOMEONE SHE SEES AS A THREAT.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.941
GET AWAY
FROM MY DAUGHTER!

33:58.601 --> 34:01.474
TAKE ME INSTEAD.
SHE DID NOTHING TO YOU.

34:01.517 --> 34:04.216
WELL, WELL, MADAM SWINE.

34:04.259 --> 34:07.262
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR LESSON IS?

34:07.306 --> 34:10.396
PERFECTION COMES
AT A PRICE.

34:25.976 --> 34:27.413
ERR!

34:29.328 --> 34:31.765
RRR!

34:31.808 --> 34:33.506
RAAH!

34:37.292 --> 34:38.772
- RAH!
- LOOK OUT!

34:42.080 --> 34:44.386
INCOMING!

34:44.430 --> 34:46.127
AAGH!

34:53.874 --> 34:55.049
UNH!

34:57.530 --> 34:59.880
AHH! AHH! AHH!

34:59.923 --> 35:01.490
AAH!

35:11.239 --> 35:15.504
AHH. FLAMINGO.

35:15.548 --> 35:16.897
EXCUSE ME?

35:16.940 --> 35:18.768
THE BULLWHIP KILLER.

35:18.812 --> 35:25.514
IT'S THE FLAMBOYANT,
PINK HARLEY-STRADDLING
PSYCHO FLAMINGO.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.299
VICTIM WAS
IN A RIVAL GANG,

35:27.342 --> 35:33.392
DNA EVIDENCE,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...SCIENCE,

35:33.435 --> 35:37.526
BUT THE POINT IS
IF THE BIKER BOOT FITS...

35:40.486 --> 35:42.662
I'LL ALERT THE VICTIM'S
FAMILY AND PUT OUT

35:42.705 --> 35:45.055
A WARRANT FOR THIS
FLAMINGO,

35:45.099 --> 35:48.624
AND I GUESS THAT MEANS
CATWOMAN'S WHIP
IS STILL OUT THERE.

35:48.668 --> 35:52.541
OHH, AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET TO THAT

35:52.585 --> 35:54.326
WHEN I'M BACK
FROM TAHITI

35:54.369 --> 35:58.373
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT,
UM...

35:58.417 --> 36:01.463
THIS BUYS ME
A WEEK'S VACATION.

36:01.507 --> 36:04.031
AND WHAT IS THIS?

36:04.074 --> 36:06.164
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

36:06.207 --> 36:10.385
ALTHOUGH SHE IS LOOKING
A LITTLE FRAIL.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.822
THIS IS A DEAD CUTTING
FROM HER VINE.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.129
- WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
- DOES IT MATTER?

36:15.173 --> 36:17.653
I REUNITED YOU
WITH YOUR LONG, LOST LOVE.

36:17.697 --> 36:20.656
TO THINK I WAS CONFUSED
ABOUT BATMAN AND CATWOMAN.

36:20.700 --> 36:26.184
IT MATTERS BECAUSE
THESE VINES DON'T
DIE UNLESS...

36:26.227 --> 36:28.708
UNLESS WHAT?

36:28.751 --> 36:30.884
UNLESS SHE'S
INFECTED SOMEONE ELSE.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.769
WHAT YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

36:46.813 --> 36:49.250
- WHAT WAS FOR DESSERT.
- HEH.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.167
JADA'S HIDING SOMETHING.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.389
I DON'T KNOW WHAT,
BUT I TRUST MY GUT ON THIS.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.955
SHE'S LYING.

37:02.045 --> 37:04.613
THEN IT'S TIME FOR HER
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

37:07.355 --> 37:10.358
CALL YOU TOMORROW,
TELL YOU WHAT I LEARNED?

37:14.536 --> 37:15.798
GOOD LUCK.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.976
GREAT FIRST DATE, HUH?

37:21.848 --> 37:23.980
DEFINITELY MEMORABLE.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.828
AND PEOPLE WONDER
WHY I DON'T THROW
DINNER PARTIES.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.395
YOU OK?

37:50.398 --> 37:53.271
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
LEFT THIS.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.490
ONCE A CROW ALWAYS
A CROW, HUH?

37:58.624 --> 38:01.366
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT JORDAN MOORE.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.846
YOUR WORD IS NOT GOOD
ENOUGH, JADA.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.587
WELL, IT HAS TO BE.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.416
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT JORDAN

38:08.460 --> 38:11.506
OR THE EXPERIMENTS
OR THE DEATHS.

38:11.550 --> 38:15.380
HOW COULD I?
I'M A MOTHER.

38:15.423 --> 38:18.165
THE WHOLE POINT
OF ALL THIS WAS THAT
NO ONE ELSE GET HURT.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.254
THE WHOLE POINT
OF WHAT?

38:22.648 --> 38:25.215
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
SOMETHING,

38:25.259 --> 38:28.175
AND FOR YOUR SAKE,
FOR EVERYONE YOU
LOVE'S SAKE,

38:28.218 --> 38:29.655
YOU NEED TO KEEP IT
TO YOURSELF.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.874
- YOU NEED TO PROMISE ME THAT.
- I CAN'T,

38:31.918 --> 38:34.050
NOT UNTIL I KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.272
MARQUIS IS SICK.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.459
WHAT'S GOING ON,
MARQUIS?

38:51.503 --> 38:53.026
WHAT'D YOU GET
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

38:53.069 --> 38:54.723
A BUG
COLLECTOR KIT.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.421
HA! THAT'S COOL.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.640
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT MAGNIFYING GLASS?

38:58.684 --> 39:02.470
MELTING ANTS. SEE?

39:02.514 --> 39:05.473
THEY BURN UP
IN THE SUN.

39:05.517 --> 39:07.606
THERE WAS
AN INCIDENT

39:07.649 --> 39:09.303
DURING A SCHOOL
FIELD TRIP.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.784
MARQUIS WAS ON THE BUS.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.960
IT PULLED UP
TO A STOPLIGHT.

39:18.312 --> 39:21.924
AND SUDDENLY,
A MAN DRESSED
LIKE A CLOWN--

39:21.968 --> 39:26.581
GREEN HAIR,
PURPLE SUIT,
BIG, UGLY SMILE--

39:26.625 --> 39:28.453
HE JUMPED ON BOARD,
TOOK OVER THE BUS.

39:28.496 --> 39:29.976
THE JOKER?

39:32.413 --> 39:34.459
THERE WAS AN ENCOUNTER
WITH MY SON.

39:34.502 --> 39:37.549
THE JOKER HAD THIS
ZAPPER ON HIS HAND.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.725
- THE JOY BUZZER.
- WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.683
HE PRESSED IT AGAINST
MY SON'S FOREHEAD,

39:41.727 --> 39:44.512
AND AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE
WENT THROUGH HIS BRAIN.

39:44.556 --> 39:47.559
AFTER THAT DAY,
HE WAS DIFFERENT, DARK,

39:47.602 --> 39:49.517
HORRIFYING.

39:49.561 --> 39:54.348
MARQUIS? NO. MARQUIS
HAS BEEN NOTHING
BUT NICE TO ME.

39:54.392 --> 39:58.657
SOCIOPATHS ARE CHARMING
95% OF THE TIME, RYAN.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.659
MOM,
DON'T BE SO LAME.

40:00.702 --> 40:02.487
IT'S NOT LAME
TO TELL YOUR DAD
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.097
I WROTE HIM A CARD!

40:04.140 --> 40:05.664
SWEETHEART, YOUR
FATHER'S OVERSEAS,

40:05.707 --> 40:07.448
AND IT WOULD MEAN
SO MUCH TO HIM

40:07.492 --> 40:10.582
- IF HE HEARD IT FROM YOUR--
- I SAID NO!

40:10.625 --> 40:13.019
SPECIALISTS,
NEUROLOGISTS,
PSYCHOLOGISTS.

40:13.062 --> 40:17.023
I HAVE SPENT MILLIONS
TRYING TO FIX HIM
BEHIND HIS BACK

40:17.066 --> 40:19.721
SO I COULD HAVE
MY SWEET BOY AGAIN,

40:19.765 --> 40:22.420
BUT NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE
TO HELP ME,

40:22.463 --> 40:25.118
AND THEN I LEARNED
OF CRYOSTASIS.

40:25.161 --> 40:27.033
SO YOU WERE BEHIND
THE FREEZE SERUM.

40:27.076 --> 40:28.817
I HAD NO IDEA
MY RESEARCH TEAM

40:28.861 --> 40:30.906
WAS CONDUCTING
HUMAN EXPERIMENTS.

40:30.950 --> 40:34.693
I JUST THOUGHT
IF I COULD SIDELINE
MARQUIS FOR A WHILE

40:34.736 --> 40:37.565
IT WOULD BUY ME
SOME TIME TO FIND
A SOLUTION.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.703
HE'S GOING IN
FOR ANOTHER BITE.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.574
HOW'S THE BURGER, DAD?

40:46.618 --> 40:49.272
DELICIOUS.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.495
WHAT THE HELL?

40:54.539 --> 40:56.149
UH-OH. HE'S ON TO ME.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.456
- IS THAT PEANUT BUTTER?
- HA HA HA!

41:01.415 --> 41:02.634
WHAT'S WRONG?

41:02.677 --> 41:05.114
PEANUTS. BURGER.

41:05.158 --> 41:08.770
FRANKLIN, WHERE'S YOUR PEN?
WHERE'S YOUR PEN?

41:22.131 --> 41:24.046
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

41:24.090 --> 41:27.049
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
I HAVE DONE

41:27.093 --> 41:29.225
SINCE THE DAY WE MET

41:29.269 --> 41:31.706
HAS BEEN TO PROTECT
YOU, RYAN.

41:35.057 --> 41:38.887
AND BECAUSE I NEED
YOUR HELP.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.107
ALL I WANT IS
TO STOP MARQUIS

41:41.150 --> 41:42.935
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE
GETS HURT.

42:12.617 --> 42:14.575
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
