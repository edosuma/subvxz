00:01.460 --> 00:03.451
(BANGING ON DOOR)

00:07.049 --> 00:08.038
Get up, House.

00:08.134 --> 00:09.169
Must be some mistake.

00:09.260 --> 00:13.629
I specifically requested
my wake-up startle
three hours from now.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.722
Some VIP visitor.
Dean of Medicine
from your old hospital.

00:21.314 --> 00:23.555
I've had dreams
about this.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.270
I'm gonna assume
this is another one.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.442
Get up.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.107
I can refuse to see
any visitor I want.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.986
Tell the Dean that
I don't want to see her.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.568
He said you'd say that.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.626
”Hell?

01:05.942 --> 01:09.685
What's the hiring
policy over there?
All ass-based?

01:10.363 --> 01:12.399
I can get you out of here.

01:12.490 --> 01:15.323
Not unless that file
has a file in it.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.111
Judge's order for
your immediate release.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.826
I had eight months
added to my sentence
two months ago.

01:26.963 --> 01:28.169
The math is
pretty basic.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.291
We have a crisis.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.256
Which is good news
for you.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.417
You're out tonight
on conditional parole,

01:34.512 --> 01:38.346
the condition being
that you're employed
by me at PPTH.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.263
No, thanks.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.179
You think it's
a good idea for me

01:43.271 --> 01:45.182
to go right back
to my old life?

01:45.314 --> 01:46.474
For either of us?

01:47.358 --> 01:51.442
Your patient is
two lungs in a box.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.695
It only has
12 hours left.

01:55.533 --> 01:59.697
No pulse, no body,
no ability to
answer questions.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.154
It's your perfect patient.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.994
I did pay for the room
for the whole week, but...

02:16.721 --> 02:19.133
FOREMAN: Donor’s
an 18-year-old college kid
back from Hofstra.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.804
Goes to a homecoming party
with his buddies,

02:20.891 --> 02:23.223
hops on his motorcycle,
ends up an organ donor.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.551
Asystole in the ER.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.143
No pulse.
No blood circulating.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.061
His heart, liver,
kidneys were all toast.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.646
Surgeons had
the recipient
on the table

02:29.734 --> 02:32.646
when they realized
the lungs had increased
airway resistance.

02:32.737 --> 02:35.228
The team closed her up,
put the lungs in
suspended animation.

02:35.573 --> 02:38.406
Buys 24 hours to fix it,
12 of which have passed.

02:38.576 --> 02:41.488
And we still have
no clue what’s wrong.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.417
Nice painting.

02:50.838 --> 02:55.047
Blues and greens.
Calming with
a hint of nurturing.

02:56.010 --> 02:59.218
Totally offsets the stench
of suffering and death.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.672
Where's my patient?
We need to not talk.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.428
ICU isolation room.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.849
The transplant team
will meet you there

03:05.936 --> 03:07.392
with updates from
the past two hours.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.017
Great. Take this.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.273
How about you drop it
in your office?

03:14.612 --> 03:18.525
I completely understand
and almost respect
your desire

03:18.616 --> 03:20.481
to appear to be
Dean of Medicine

03:20.576 --> 03:22.362
given that your title
is Dean of Medicine.

03:22.453 --> 03:25.286
On the other hand,
seriously?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.624
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

03:31.629 --> 03:33.460
Get this straight.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.580
You break the law,
you go back to jail.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.456
Scam extra Vicodin,
back to jail.

03:37.802 --> 03:41.886
F|out my authority,
make the hospital
look bad, back to jail.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.808
I own you.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.304
Yes, master.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.475
See, that would be
an example.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.227
When did Cuddy leave?

03:57.321 --> 04:00.563
She gave her notice
the day after
your incident.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.776
Took a job...

04:01.867 --> 04:03.573
Don't need the details.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.276
(DEVICE WHIRRING)

04:09.083 --> 04:10.619
FOREMAN: Ortho
needed more space.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.166
You're this way.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.257
Where's my stuff?

04:20.344 --> 04:21.845
FOREMAN: No idea.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.340
What about my team?

04:24.432 --> 04:25.421
Pathetic.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.756
The first thing
you said to me

04:26.851 --> 04:28.682
was you don't want
your old environment,

04:28.769 --> 04:31.385
the fourth thing you said was,
"Where's my old environment?"

04:31.480 --> 04:35.098
It's been a year.
Taub, Chase,
Thirteen all moved on.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.766
The world
does that sometimes.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.442
No, it doesn't.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.479
Here's your new office.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.317
And there's
your new team.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.292
Hi.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.004
I'm not interested in
another department's
sloppy seconds.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.171
I'm not sloppy seconds...

05:00.259 --> 05:01.339
It's 3:00 am.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.296
If Foreman had
called you in from home,

05:03.387 --> 05:06.129
you wouldn't have
pressed clothes,
coiffed hair and make-up.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.759
Which means
you were already here
in the hospital.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.091
Yes, l was on-call
for Neurology.

05:10.186 --> 05:14.429
If that were true,
you'd be working right now
and unavailable to help.

05:14.773 --> 05:15.808
Which means that
you're hanging out

05:15.900 --> 05:17.515
in the hospital
pretending to work.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.350
Which means you're
notjust a reject,

05:19.445 --> 05:23.654
you're a cowardly reject
who's trying to hide her
rejectedness from someone.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.981
I am not a reject.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.067
Then go back
to Neurology.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.618
I can't.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.160
l punched my attending.

05:55.397 --> 05:59.390
ARDS secondary to trauma
is our leading hypothesis.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.650

Sorry, I thought
I heard everyone else
think that.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.366
lwas in prison, see?

06:10.579 --> 06:13.787
It was a long time ago,
but still, you're curious.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.114
Never was raped.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.204
Not raped-raped.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.081
Well, raped-raped but
not raped-raped-raped.

06:22.758 --> 06:26.592
Well, now that
we've got that
completely behind us...

06:27.054 --> 06:29.887
I'm sorry.
Dr. House, welcome back...

06:30.182 --> 06:31.638
Is there cake?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.559
Any alveolar exudate?

06:36.647 --> 06:37.853
No. Lungs are dry.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.101
Well, it's not ARDS.
It's the autumn.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.141
lt's tick-borne
disease season.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.443
Ehrlichiosis
causing bronchiolitis.

06:45.990 --> 06:49.824
You'll appreciate
that I left
the "idiots" subtextual.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.943
Blood smear was clear,
and we idiots

06:52.037 --> 06:54.153
treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.072
Cocaine.
Tox screen was clean.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.246
Dead men don't pee.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.495
Tox screen tests
for metabolites
in the urine.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.414
Coke never got
past the lungs.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.666
Also explains
the motorcycle crash.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.456
ldiots.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.175
Let's get the lungs
on treatment.

07:08.304 --> 07:10.590
Great idea,
unless you're wrong.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.921
And by you, I mean me.

07:12.016 --> 07:14.348
Then this treatment will
burn holes in the lungs.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.179
I'd call you idiots,
but at this point,

07:16.312 --> 07:18.598
I'm starting to doubt
whether you understand
what I mean by the word.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.681
Kato, get Black Beauty
and meet me out front.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.435
We're gonna find
the dead kid's stash.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.287
Since an 18-year-old
with organ donor

07:37.374 --> 07:39.114
on his license is
not a cancer patient,

07:39.209 --> 07:41.621
l'm figuring the recipient
is a lifetime member

07:41.712 --> 07:43.202
of the Wilson
Cares Too Much Club.

07:43.339 --> 07:44.795
Excellent deduction.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.882
You're the reason
I'm out of the big house.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.796
Doesn't quite make up
for never visiting, but...

07:49.887 --> 07:51.468
Springing you
was Foreman's idea.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.967
I wasn't convinced
until Simpson
failed three times.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.889
Amounts to the same thing,
you wanted me back.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.384
See, I knew
you'd over-interpret it.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.811
Strong,
emotional reaction.

08:00.898 --> 08:04.231
I guess that's what
lifetime membership
gets you.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.604
How's your wrist?

08:06.695 --> 08:08.401
Healed, thank you.

08:08.864 --> 08:09.899
lwas wrong.
(PAGER BEEPING)

08:09.990 --> 08:11.901
I went to prison,
I paid the price.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.649
You're a changed man.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.235
I said I was wrong,
I didn't say I changed.
I haven't.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.448
Neither have you.
Which is why...

08:17.539 --> 08:18.528
Analyze it
however you like.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.705
We're not friends anymore.

My chest...

08:32.429 --> 08:33.839
Angina's back.

08:34.098 --> 08:37.010
Upping the nitro.
Should knock it back down.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.217
Sis and l were talking,
trying to figure out

08:39.353 --> 08:42.436
how many hospital
sleepovers we've had.
(LAUGHS)

08:42.856 --> 08:46.644
Definitely started
with the Great
Mastectomy of 2001.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.060
God, I miss my boobs.
(SIGHS)

08:50.447 --> 08:51.983
They were spectacular.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.439
(CHUCKLES)

08:54.326 --> 08:57.068
Is there a chance of
locating another donor?

08:57.871 --> 08:58.951
lt's unlikely,

08:59.206 --> 09:00.742
especially since
with the extent

09:00.833 --> 09:02.323
of the emphysema,
she needs a double lung.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.373
How you doing?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.337
Better already.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.377
It's a good thing
that worked

09:11.468 --> 09:13.254
or I was gonna
make you bring me a bottle.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.387
(GROANS) Lighten up, Sis.

09:17.474 --> 09:21.058
Least you could do
is laugh at
a dying lady's jokes.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.470
Your drinking
wasn't funny then, okay?
And it's not funny now.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.681
Because you're not dying.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.151
The hospital
brought in a consultant
to work on the lungs.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.944
Do you know him?
Is he good?

09:34.700 --> 09:37.032
He is an excellent doctor.

weeping.

I'd really
rather not discuss...

09:54.261 --> 09:56.422
Okay, I'll go first.
My boss dumped me.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.596
And yours, what,
called you
his china doll?

09:59.683 --> 10:02.766
Joked about
what a crappy deal
you got for Manhattan?

10:02.853 --> 10:05.310
Assumed that
you have a huge penis?

10:06.523 --> 10:07.933
l have no idea
what flavor you are,

10:08.025 --> 10:11.017
so I thought I'd just
cover the spread.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.193
My mom's Filipino,
Dad's Korean.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.363
And my boss
grabbed my behind.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.065
Behind what?

10:18.994 --> 10:22.202
Oh, yeah, your...
Grabbed your tushy.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.571
So now you're
pretending to be on-call

10:24.666 --> 10:26.793
so that your overly
protective boyfriend

10:26.877 --> 10:29.209
won't find out
you got groped.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.876
I don't have a boyfriend.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.044
It's my parents.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.047
If they found out
what I've done,
they'd be mortified.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.216
Your parents know
your call schedule?

10:40.808 --> 10:42.594
I live with them.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.638
Right.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.852
No issues there.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.599
I told you,
my son didn't do cocaine.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.563
Druggies are not known
for their honesty.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.068
Trust me on this one.

10:59.785 --> 11:03.994
Mr. Weathers,
I'm sure you're right,
but we need to be thorough.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.914
Did your son ever
smoke marijuana?

11:07.209 --> 11:10.292
He was an athlete,
took real good care
of himself... Hey.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.416
Take it easy.
Steve loved all that...

11:13.507 --> 11:14.997
Sorry,
but we're on a clock.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.801
(WHISPERING)
I think he's about
to throw us out.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.305
Nope.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.728
His son is dead.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.646
The only way
that has any meaning

11:31.733 --> 11:34.145
is ifwe fix the lungs
and transplant them.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.692
It doesn't matter how
much we piss him off

11:35.779 --> 11:37.110
as long as
we find something.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.610
So go back there,
piss him off and
find something.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.368
Do you know any of
the kids at the party
with your son?

11:49.418 --> 11:51.033
MR. WEATHERS: A bunch of
his high school buddies,

11:51.128 --> 11:53.039
they'd gotten
really into poker,

11:53.422 --> 11:56.380
decided to have
an all-night game
in Brandon Broome's basement.

11:57.593 --> 11:58.753
Hey...

12:01.221 --> 12:03.086

24:39.103 --> 24:42.095

Good job.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.984
Right middle lobe isn't.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.739
FOREMAN: Nothing.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.739
We killed part
of the lung.

to the cath lab.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.842
We're going
to the cath lab?
Are you thinking that...

25:16.933 --> 25:18.389
What? Who?

25:19.227 --> 25:21.684
One dead lobe
means four live ones,

25:21.771 --> 25:23.477
means enough
to transplant,

25:23.564 --> 25:26.351
with a side order
of dead tissue
that we can test.

25:26.526 --> 25:29.689
Makes sense,
unlike you
stealing my phone.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.439

25:39.080 --> 25:40.411

Independence Day.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.201
I told you
I'm Korean and Filipino.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.658
And I told you
I wasn't listening.
By my actions.

25:45.962 --> 25:48.920
Violence isn't
an appropriate way
to handle conflict.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.291
It was a moment
of weakness.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.920
You've barked at me,
picked a fight
with a painting crew.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.717
Maybe it's time to
recognize it's not
a character flaw.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.511
Maybe it's your character.

26:05.148 --> 26:06.308

26:10.737 --> 26:14.229
So, why did chelation
make the lungs worse?

26:14.991 --> 26:16.856
We got about five minutes
till Pinto gets back.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.316
Give me a hand
with this.
No.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.910
l tracked down
another bag of plasma

26:20.997 --> 26:22.487
from the batch
they used on the donor,

26:22.999 --> 26:25.786
negative for
all our other exposures.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.915
Sarcoidosis could
be inflamed
by the treatment.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.873

26:35.303 --> 26:38.466

26:38.556 --> 26:40.387

And it's yourjob.

26:40.475 --> 26:43.091
My job is to assist you
in curing the lungs.

26:43.186 --> 26:44.847
This chair will
help me do that.

26:47.190 --> 26:50.557
What if the scrapings
from the bridge contained
other heavy metals,

26:50.651 --> 26:53.779
like beryllium,
or asbestos?

26:53.863 --> 26:57.230
Chelation for lead
wouldn't have
made them worse.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.824
But

27:06.501 --> 27:09.208
maybe the problem
isn't a heavy metal
from outside.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.660
lt's inside.

27:10.755 --> 27:14.373
But it's not leaving the body
like it's supposed to,
it's stuck.

27:15.218 --> 27:18.301
lron.
Donor had hemosiderosis.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.639
His body wasn't
disposing of iron,

27:20.723 --> 27:22.679
massive amounts
choke up the lungs.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.928
Then our chelation
would wreak havoc

27:25.019 --> 27:26.259
because it picks up
too much stuff.

27:26.354 --> 27:28.345
Go stain the dead
lung tissue for iron.

27:32.401 --> 27:36.019
I'm sorry, young lady,
I simply will not
help you steal this chair.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.868
Hi.

She can barely
catch her breath.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.121
(GASPING)

27:52.672 --> 27:54.412
Lungs ready yet?

27:54.549 --> 27:57.416
We had a small setback.
We're testing
for iron overload.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.045
I thought it was lead.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.047
This is not
an exact process.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.640
Your small airways
are collapsing.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.387
You're not
getting enough oxygen.

28:09.313 --> 28:12.726
I'd like to try forcing
an oxygen-rich slurry
into your lungs.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.057
It should open up
the airways

28:14.151 --> 28:16.142
and buy you some time
until the lungs are ready.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.234
Fluid in my lungs?

28:23.619 --> 28:25.484
Sounds like drowning.

28:27.665 --> 28:28.825
It is.

28:33.296 --> 28:35.753
Gonna hurt, isn't it?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.881
Yes. A fair amount.

28:44.432 --> 28:45.638
No.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.679
I'm done.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.023
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

28:57.570 --> 28:59.561

House, the nurses
saw you come in.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.986
Enter.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.450
It's a bathroom.

29:03.534 --> 29:04.569
Ah!

29:04.660 --> 29:06.446

in this chair.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.411
God, I've missed doors.

29:16.547 --> 29:17.878
And air freshener.

29:20.760 --> 29:24.002
Now go away.
I'm waiting for
some test results.

29:24.138 --> 29:26.470
My patient signed a DNR,
she's giving up.

29:26.557 --> 29:29.264
Looks like someone else
will be getting the lungs.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.760
Making this yet
another interaction with you
in which I get nothing.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.096
It's not my fault
you can't handle
your patient.

29:36.150 --> 29:37.811
She said she's done.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.943
I spent half an hour
trying to change her mind,
but she'd made her decision.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.736
I accepted that.
It's called respect.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.491
What's after respect?

29:45.409 --> 29:47.900
You find another angle,
you hold her hands,

29:47.995 --> 29:51.613
get the sister to beg,
stick your fingers
in your ears

29:51.707 --> 29:53.243
and pretend
you can't hear her.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.074
Do whatever it takes.

29:55.252 --> 29:59.211
Oh. Whatever it takes?
Thanks, House,
I hadn't thought of that.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.015
What are you
testing for?
Hemosiderosis.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.895
I'm staining
for excess iron.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.223
Promising.

30:19.568 --> 30:24.062
When your dad
showed up unexpectedly,
House have a hand in that?

30:24.615 --> 30:26.606
I'm guessing he does
things like that a lot.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.450
His version
of a compliment.

30:32.123 --> 30:34.660
I spoke to the head of
Neurology in Chicago.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.001
I gave you
a good recommendation.

30:36.293 --> 30:37.794
Did you mention
what happened?

30:38.295 --> 30:40.286
Lawyers say
I'm not allowed to.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.292
Works out well
for everyone.

30:46.387 --> 30:48.002
Why exactly is
that good for you?

30:48.097 --> 30:49.132
Excuse me?

30:49.223 --> 30:52.431
I'm a talented physician,
top 2% of my class.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.758
I'm an asset
to this hospital,

30:53.853 --> 30:55.514
an asset you're about
to lose to Chicago.

30:55.604 --> 30:58.767
You applied for the job,
you asked me to call
and recommend you...

30:58.858 --> 31:01.349
Andrews is the one
that should leave,
he's the supervisor.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.892
He touched me first.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.103
I can't discuss
any of that,
not before the hearing.

31:07.158 --> 31:10.195
But if you're having
doubts about Chicago,
I can call them back.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.581
No. Thank you.

31:19.837 --> 31:22.749
Dr. Foreman,
would you look at this?

31:24.425 --> 31:25.915
Iron?
No.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.875
White blood cells.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.007
Classic presentation
of an infection.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.510
How the hell
did we miss that?

31:38.773 --> 31:41.981
CHI: Biopsy revealed
white blood cell infiltrates.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.268
Infection was right
after all.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.731
Fresh fruit in prison
is usually chicken.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.815

We're running out of time.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.993
(SCREAMING) She's dying!

31:56.082 --> 31:58.619
Were you able to
figure out what was wrong
while I was screaming?

32:00.044 --> 32:02.877
Infection was the first thing
that the transplant team
treated for.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.625
Which would've worked
if the bacteria had
been out in the open.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.581
If they're hiding
inside the lung's cells...

32:08.427 --> 32:10.463
I'm thinking Brucella.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.045
To wipe that out,
you need special ops.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.132
An intact
immune system.

32:16.811 --> 32:19.598
But that's what
white blood cells are.

32:19.730 --> 32:23.723
They're part of
the immune defense force,
like the infantry.

32:24.151 --> 32:27.769
Those lungs need
the Air Force,
the Marines,

32:27.863 --> 32:30.320

raining down from above.

32:32.660 --> 32:34.446
Antibiotics and IVIG.

32:37.081 --> 32:39.447
Did you use metaphors
for your old team?

32:39.542 --> 32:42.454
Or do you just think
I'm particularly stupid?

32:43.462 --> 32:45.669
No. They were stupid, too.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.552
What are you doing here?

32:59.478 --> 33:00.467
I'm here for Vanessa.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.224
Now is not the time,
Bobby.

33:02.523 --> 33:05.105
She asked me to come.
Right, Doc?

33:06.527 --> 33:09.394
Actually,
it was my idea.

33:09.822 --> 33:11.983
What? What are you thinking?
She doesn't want to see him.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.905
When Vanessa was
ready to quit chemo,

33:13.993 --> 33:15.824
Bobby's the one
who got her to
do one more round.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.653
Yeah. And then
he got her drunk.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.621
At least tell me
you haven't been
drinking today.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.629
I should go.
Yeah.

I needed that. Thank you.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.440

34:31.946 --> 34:35.564
It was good advice.
ljust came here
to say thank you.

34:39.328 --> 34:40.613

that you don't like me,
you don't have fun with me,

34:47.378 --> 34:48.458
I can accept that.

34:48.545 --> 34:52.083

whatever you have to do
to get over this.

kick me in the nuts.

Both seems excessive.
