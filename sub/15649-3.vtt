18:27.272 --> 18:28.148
LET'S GO MAKE MISCHIEF.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.735
SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.280
MRS. BIGHEAD?

18:35.364 --> 18:37.533
ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.618
I'M MR. DUPET.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.620
THAT WAS NO
ED BIGHEAD SPEECH

18:41.703 --> 18:43.038
WE HEARD BACK THERE.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.456
NOW, JUST A MINUTE.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.791
MY HUSBAND IS A...

18:45.874 --> 18:48.460
{\an5}HE'S CERTAINLY
NOT A GENIUS
OF YOUR CALIBER.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.587
GENIUS?

18:50.671 --> 18:52.339
ABSOLUTELY.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.092
OH, PSHAW AND PISH.

18:55.175 --> 18:59.054
{\an1}I'M SERIOUS, WE NEED A GREAT
EXECUTIVE MIND LIKE YOURS.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.515
WELL, I DO HAVE
A FEW SUGGESTIONS.

19:01.598 --> 19:05.310
{\an1}FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'D INCREASE
PRODUCTIVITY AT LEAST 49%

19:05.394 --> 19:10.148
{\an1}IF YOU WEREN'T ALL PICKING
YOUR NOSES ALL THE TIME.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.149
GENIUS!

19:11.233 --> 19:11.316
HEATHWOOD.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.194
INCREDIBLE.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.947
WELCOME TO CONGLOM-O,
MRS. BIGHEAD.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.376
(<i> phones ringing</i> )

19:29.459 --> 19:31.295

19:38.886 --> 19:41.179
(<i> static on television</i> )

19:44.641 --> 19:46.393
ED.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.229
ED.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.065
{\an1}YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGED
WITH TREASON.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.526
{\an1}HOW DO YOU PLEA,
FROGGY LIPS?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.778
Heffer:
HE LOOKS FUNNY.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.531
{\an3}Filburt:
SHUT UP.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.452
{\an5}ED BIGHEAD,
I AM YOUR
CONSCIENCE.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.121
{\an5}Heffer:
I'M HIS CONSCIENCE,
TOO.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.289
WHAT?

20:07.372 --> 20:10.208
DON'T SAY "I," SAY "WE."

20:10.292 --> 20:10.417
WHAT?

20:12.294 --> 20:14.004
WE,<i> WE.</i>

20:14.087 --> 20:16.548
OH, OKAY, WE WE.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.968
Heffer (<i> giggling</i> ):
YOU SAID, "WE WE."

20:20.052 --> 20:21.887
(<i> continues</i>
<i>giggling</i> )

20:21.970 --> 20:23.305
SAY IT AGAIN.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.431
{\an3}WE WE.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.891
(<i> Heffer continues</i>
<i>giggling</i> )

20:25.974 --> 20:29.311
{\an1}YOUR CONSCIENCE
HAS SPOKEN.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.312
(<i> pop</i> )

20:30.395 --> 20:31.813
(<i> yelling</i> )

20:31.897 --> 20:34.733
(<i> both yelling</i> )

20:37.945 --> 20:42.282
{\an5}Woman (<i> over intercom</i> ):
Mrs. Big Head, the water coolers
are in.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.367
COME IN, DEAR.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.326
(<i> sighs</i> )

20:44.409 --> 20:46.870
OH, DON'T YOU LOOK DARLING.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.582
{\an5}(<i> underwater echo</i> ):
MRS. BIGHEAD?
YOU SOUND A LITTLE SAD

20:50.666 --> 20:52.167
EVERYTHING OKAY?

20:52.250 --> 20:55.212
OH, I JUST MISS MY LITTLE EDDIE.

20:55.295 --> 20:59.174
I HAVEN'T SEEN
HIS BIG GREEN FACE FOR DAYS.

20:59.257 --> 21:03.595
{\an1}AH, BUT THAT'S THE LIFE
OF A BUSY EXECUTIVE.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.015
MRS. BIGHEAD
MISSES HER HUSBAND.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.977
{\an1}MRS. BIGHEAD
MISSES HER HUSBAND.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.145
MRS. BIGHEAD
MISSES HER HUSBAND.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.190
(<i> sighs</i> )

21:19.653 --> 21:20.821
All:
SURPRISE.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.532
(<i> giggling</i> )

21:23.615 --> 21:25.200
OH, HOW SWEET!

21:25.283 --> 21:27.703
OH, YOU'RE ALL SO THOUGHTFUL.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.373
LOUISE, DEAR, WOULD YOU ASK
MR. DUPET IF HE'LL SEE ME?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.208
CERTAINLY, MRS. BIGHEAD.

21:33.291 --> 21:37.462
{\an1}MR. DUPET,
HOW IS CONGLOM-O THESE DAYS?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.089
THINGS COULDN'T BE BETTER.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.716
MORALE IS THE BEST EVER

21:40.799 --> 21:43.218
AND PROFITS ARE GOING
THROUGH THE ROOF.

21:43.301 --> 21:45.387
{\an1}YOU SAY THINGS
COULDN'T BE BETTER?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.471
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.723
{\an1}THEN MY WORK HERE
IS FINISHED.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.057
FINISHED?!

21:49.141 --> 21:52.894
MRS. BIGHEAD,
CONGLOM-O NEEDS YOU!

21:52.978 --> 21:55.397
CONGLOM-O WILL BE FINE.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.982
{\an1}I HAD A LOVELY TIME
WORKING FOR YOU

21:57.065 --> 21:59.860
BUT THIS ISN'T
WHERE I BELONG.

21:59.943 --> 22:00.902
MRS. BIGHEAD...

22:00.986 --> 22:03.989
{\an1}OH, AND I'LL BE TAKING
THE BUILDING THIS WEEKEND

22:04.072 --> 22:06.283
ON A LITTLE VACATION.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.202
{\an1}I'LL HAVE MY HUSBAND
BRING IT BACK NEXT WEEKEND

22:09.286 --> 22:09.995
{\an1}WHEN HE'LL BE
TAKING MY PLACE.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.913
MRS. BIGHEAD, PLEASE, PLEASE.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.083
HE'S THE TOAD FOR THE JOB.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.418
BUT...

22:16.501 --> 22:18.962
HAVE I BEEN WRONG BEFORE?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.885
(<i> sobbing</i> )

22:25.969 --> 22:27.721
{\an5}ALL ABOARD
FOR A RELAXING
VACATION.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.432
YEAH, WELL, I HOPE

22:30.515 --> 22:33.518
{\an1}THEY CAN GET ALONG
WITHOUT ME FOR A WEEK.

22:33.602 --> 22:37.230
NOW, DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT WORK, DARLING.

22:38.148 --> 22:38.857
SEE THERE?

22:38.940 --> 22:41.568
SOME PEON NEEDS
ME ALREADY, SEE?

22:41.651 --> 22:43.070
LOOK, I'M ON VACATION.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.279
(<i> clock chimes</i> )

22:44.362 --> 22:44.988
OH, ED.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.990

23:05.384 --> 23:07.511
REPEAT AFTER ME:

23:07.594 --> 23:09.471
WE WE.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.764
All:
WE WE.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.808
(<i> laughing</i> )

23:12.891 --> 23:14.768
SAY IT AGAIN.
