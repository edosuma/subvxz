WEBVTT

00:10.950 --> 00:15.230
stupid analog piece of crap machine.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.360
'cause that's drunken dog style.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.070
If I had done that for real,you'd
be paralyzed.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.080
Right this way.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.000
On ray carling's birthday,

00:33.030 --> 00:38.750
let the scotch flow free and let no
hooker spend the night in holding.

00:38.830 --> 00:39.570
Yes.

00:39.630 --> 00:41.670
I thought we were having carrot cake
and root beer.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.160
Yeah,well,sizeable ted brought in a fifth.

00:44.260 --> 00:45.800
The boys downstairs£¬they sent up a keg.

00:45.850 --> 00:47.280
I mean,what was I gonna do?Come on.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.370
No one's minding the store,ray,

00:48.430 --> 00:50.340
and you're taking pictures of your penis?

00:50.450 --> 00:51.680
Relax,dipstick.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.000
Th114 is covering for us.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.340
That leaves us free to drink,

00:56.375 --> 00:57.375
to make merry,

00:57.410 --> 01:02.540
and to take this midnight train to
those hot pants.

01:05.220 --> 01:05.820
Easy.

01:06.180 --> 01:07.810
this is insanity.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.280
I'm filing a complaint.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.780
No,no,it's too loud.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.140
Too loud.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.390
Keep the noise down.

01:16.790 --> 01:20.430
rabbi levy just filed a complaint of
excessive noise£¬

01:20.630 --> 01:23.280
lewdness and public indecency,all
against us.

01:23.530 --> 01:24.310
We got off easy.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.310
So why aren't you joiningthe party?

01:26.570 --> 01:27.420
Oh,I don't know.

01:27.450 --> 01:29.980
Maybe because the only women partying
are hookers.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.200
What's your excuse?

01:31.350 --> 01:32.190
who's thirsty?

01:32.540 --> 01:34.630
Oh,maybe 'cause all the men partying
are tools.

01:35.690 --> 01:36.480
Tools?

01:37.680 --> 01:38.820
I like that.

01:39.030 --> 01:41.040
Like a monkey wrench in my happiness.

01:41.860 --> 01:45.090
I can't believe I have to cover
the desk on this,of all nights.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.450
Sucks to be you.

01:46.490 --> 01:49.040
After I pop this little baby in
the case file,

01:49.240 --> 01:50.430
I am done.

01:52.470 --> 01:53.410
Thanks,buddy.

01:55.750 --> 01:56.690
You know what?

01:56.780 --> 01:59.230
Just for tonight,if you'll be a hooker,

02:00.110 --> 02:01.300
I'll be a tool.

02:24.980 --> 02:26.160
I think they like you.

02:26.470 --> 02:30.510
Well,they're gonna love me after
these futuristic dance moves.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.190

02:37.780 --> 02:53.710
Spaceman!Spaceman!Spaceman...

02:54.950 --> 02:56.010
spaceman!

02:58.680 --> 03:00.260
who's bad?

03:42.700 --> 03:44.240
1-2-5 squad.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.540
sam?

03:46.150 --> 03:48.080
Sammy,can you hear me?

03:48.100 --> 03:49.750
This is detective tyler. Who's this?

03:49.940 --> 03:52.190
I know you can't hear me,Sammy,

03:52.225 --> 03:54.440
but I want you to know I'm here.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.640
Mom?

03:55.690 --> 03:57.020
The doctors have tried everything.

03:57.110 --> 03:59.290
They say they can't bring you back.

03:59.470 --> 04:00.660
They say you're gone.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.340
No,no,I'm not- I'm not gone.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.280
I'm right here.

04:03.350 --> 04:04.540
I didn't wanna believe them.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.090
I wish you could give me a sign,

04:06.280 --> 04:07.680
sammy,that you're still in there.

04:07.750 --> 04:08.810
A sign?What- what kind of sign?

04:08.920 --> 04:11.360
I gave my consent.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.420
At 2:00,they're turning your machine off.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.940
No. No,no,no,no,no,no.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.425
You came into the worldon a tuesday,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.750
and now you're gonna leave on a tuesday.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.515
No.

04:21.550 --> 04:22.590
Don't let them do that.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.450
I'm right here. It's sammy.

04:24.485 --> 04:26.680
I love you so much.

04:27.030 --> 04:28.380
Good-bye,sam.

04:32.330 --> 04:33.900
what the hell,yler?!

04:34.620 --> 04:36.600
Up,you degenerates.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.820
We got a hostage crisis at memorial hospital.

04:41.030 --> 04:44.560
Some nutjob says he's gonna start
killing people at 2:00.

04:46.990 --> 04:49.320
That's what he's promising

04:49.355 --> 04:51.615
that somebody dies at 2:00.

04:51.650 --> 04:52.960
Let's put some hustle on. Come on.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.600
It's gonna be a cockroach crawl.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.030
chop suey,chop suey.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.500
I smell a body count.

04:57.870 --> 04:58.580
No.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.900
No one dies today.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.640
No one.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.970
My name is sam tyler.

05:07.410 --> 05:10.270
I was in an accident,and I woke up in 1973.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.930
I don't know how or why I'm here,

05:12.965 --> 05:14.180
but whatever's happened,

05:14.230 --> 05:16.300
it's like I've landed on a different planet.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.430
Now maybe if I can work out the reason,

05:18.465 --> 05:20.390
I can get home.

How can you tell who's who?

05:38.080 --> 05:39.310
Where the hell is E.S.U.?

05:39.530 --> 05:40.530
I mean,E.S.S.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.060
cool your toes there,spaceman.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.120
We're all hungover.

05:43.160 --> 05:43.880
Lieutenant,

05:44.070 --> 05:47.850
we got one armed perp who entered the
hospital at approximately 0830 hours.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.600
After people evacuated,he locked
all main entries.

05:50.710 --> 05:53.090
We're not sure exactly where
he's holed up.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.450
All this for one schmo?

05:55.850 --> 05:56.890
How many hostages?

05:56.940 --> 05:57.860
Not sure.

05:58.210 --> 06:00.880
The windows are all one-way or covered.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.885
And we're still interviewing
the main witness.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.960
he had a gun as long as my arm and
the eyes of a sex maniac.

06:07.170 --> 06:08.540
I feared for my life.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.240
Am i gonna be on tv?

06:10.430 --> 06:12.840
All right,sweetheart,you'll be on
carson soon enough.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.860
But right now you just talk to us.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.110
What did you see?

06:16.130 --> 06:19.240
This guy came in with a shotgun and
grabbed dr. Schwahn

06:19.320 --> 06:20.850
he's our psychosurgeon.

06:21.150 --> 06:22.370
I think he knew the doctor.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.730
Then he told us to leave.

06:23.790 --> 06:24.690
What'd he look like?

06:24.730 --> 06:27.380
30s,white,big bohunk of a guy.

06:27.460 --> 06:28.480
His list of demands.

06:30.230 --> 06:33.800
He says he wants a nurse with surgical
experience and an E.E.G.Machine.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.340
What is an E.E.G.Machine?

06:35.560 --> 06:37.530
It's specialized machine at reads
brain waves.

06:37.690 --> 06:38.810
The hospital should have one.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.770
He says it'll all be over at 2:00.

06:40.890 --> 06:42.600
If we go along with his demands,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.360
he'll let go of the hostages then.

06:44.510 --> 06:45.250
I don't care what he wants.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.800
I'm not sending in no civilian nurse.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.000
You could send in me.

06:49.090 --> 06:51.550
I had some medical training as part
of my degree.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.410
It's 9:45.

06:55.450 --> 06:58.640
We have a little over four hours to
resolve the situation.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.690
I will be the primary negotiator.

07:00.725 --> 07:02.610
Maybe I should take lead,boss.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.940
I've trained officers in the hostage
confrontation program for years.

07:06.070 --> 07:06.910
Nice try.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.840
The program just started this year.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.680
Ray,you'll take over as commander in chief.

07:11.820 --> 07:12.570
You gotta be kidding me.

07:12.740 --> 07:13.740
I got way more experience than him.

07:13.910 --> 07:16.010
My aunt tillie's chihuahua has
more experience

07:16.110 --> 07:17.410
spacejerk!

07:17.550 --> 07:18.395
I can hear you.

07:18.430 --> 07:19.870
What's wrong with you,tyler?

07:20.020 --> 07:21.960
All morning,you've been coming on
like a russian tank.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.660
The other teams know ray better.

07:23.790 --> 07:24.470
Lieutenant?

07:24.510 --> 07:25.620
We set up over here.

07:35.710 --> 07:36.450
all right.

07:36.570 --> 07:39.220
Chris,I want to know what's going on
inside that hospital.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.980
I need remote monitoring methods.

07:42.140 --> 07:43.270
Think outside the box.

07:43.390 --> 07:44.710
Outside the box?

07:44.930 --> 07:45.990
But be clever.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.420
I can be clever.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.330
I need you to find out everything you
can about this hostage taker.

07:52.450 --> 07:53.360
You have a psych degree.

07:53.430 --> 07:54.540
I need to know his state of mind.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.180
Sure.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.835
- sam? -Yeah?

07:57.870 --> 07:59.630
Is there something else?

08:05.260 --> 08:06.610
I heard from my mother...

08:07.110 --> 08:08.580
in 2008.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.810
They're gonna pull the plug on my
life support at 2:00.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.500
And why are you on life support?

08:14.660 --> 08:15.960
Apparently,I'm in a coma.

08:16.380 --> 08:17.490
In 2008?

08:17.620 --> 08:19.980
And now the hostage taker's gonna
ll someone at 2:00.

08:20.570 --> 08:21.910
That's not a coincidence.

08:24.120 --> 08:24.810
What?

08:24.980 --> 08:25.870
Your ego.

08:26.550 --> 08:27.970
Your monster ego.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.940
Sam,there are people in danger
in that building,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.210
people on the wrong side of a
crazy person's gun,

08:32.980 --> 08:34.539
and somehow this is all about you?

08:35.370 --> 08:36.289
My god.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.200
There's a connection.

08:37.270 --> 08:40.250
I don't know how or why,but something
really bad is gonna happen at 2:00,

08:40.870 --> 08:41.909
and I have to stop it.

08:41.970 --> 08:43.309
Here's a psych term for you.

08:43.450 --> 08:47.090
Narcissism-the exaggerated sense of
self-importance.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.640
I think you've got a bad case of it.

08:51.650 --> 08:54.030
I'll do your research for you,but,

08:54.110 --> 08:55.720
and i never thought I'd say this-

08:56.120 --> 08:58.120
I'm glad ray's calling the shots.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.090
all right.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.280
they're setting up a direct line
between us and the hospital.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.910
But in the meantime...

09:09.070 --> 09:09.880
got a dime?

09:10.260 --> 09:11.370
Uh,yeah.

09:12.430 --> 09:13.010
Wait.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.070
Y- you're just gonna call?

09:14.200 --> 09:14.790
Right now?

09:14.900 --> 09:15.700
Are you even prepped?

09:17.060 --> 09:17.970
You're right.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.630
Well,you don't need me to tell you
the key is keeping them cool...

09:30.230 --> 09:31.380
and calm.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.330
This is lieutenant gene hunt.

09:34.730 --> 09:35.590
Yeah?

09:35.680 --> 09:37.450
Well,if you don't come out now,

09:37.620 --> 09:42.020
I'll send the hammer of new york's
finest up your pail!

09:44.300 --> 09:45.750
what the hell was that?

09:45.950 --> 09:47.060
You don't antagonize him!

09:47.260 --> 09:49.305
That's the first rule of hostage
negotiation.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.470
That only applies when a criminal
is in his right mind,

09:51.620 --> 09:53.550
which this fruit loop is clearly not.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.290
He has a beef with the head doctor.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.320
He doesn't want to talk.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.940
For all we know,he's already killed
the hostages.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.150
We hit him quick. We hit him hard.

10:00.420 --> 10:01.880
Shock and awe. That's your lution.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.930
"Shock and awe. "I like that.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.370
Well,we gotta keep trying to communicate.

10:05.540 --> 10:06.240
It's protocol.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.510
I've been in five standoffs alone this year.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.080
Know how many lives we saved using protocol?

10:11.590 --> 10:12.470
None.

10:12.860 --> 10:16.040
But if you think you can talk to this twerp,

10:16.440 --> 10:17.550
be my guest.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.390
Boss,the chief's on the radio.
He wants an update.

10:25.740 --> 10:26.390
hey.

10:26.530 --> 10:28.190
Hello. This is detective tyler.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.740
What my colleague meant to say-
you have to do something.

10:31.890 --> 10:33.290
You're running out of time,sam.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.890
2:00.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.370
sam!

10:41.950 --> 10:45.860
I think I got a good "out of the box" option...

10:45.900 --> 10:47.060
in this box.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.060
It's an E.E.G.Machine,

10:49.220 --> 10:50.850
just like the hostage taker asked for.

10:50.970 --> 10:55.170
But we can fit with a false back and
put it an electra candid covert recorder.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.180
It's what th used on- on "candid camera.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.230
" And with a transmitter,we can beam
the images out.

11:00.380 --> 11:01.590
Where's the camera and the transmitter?

11:02.140 --> 11:03.640
That's the one snag.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.780
All that stuff costs 12 grand.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.390
I went and asked ray,but he just laughed.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.910
And then he called the E.M.T.S over,

11:09.940 --> 11:10.970
and they just laughed.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.580
I got something on dr. Schwahn.

11:12.750 --> 11:13.330
What is it?

11:13.480 --> 11:15.250
Dr. Schwahn,noted psychosurgeon,

11:15.440 --> 11:18.850
recently cured a man of compulsive
hand-washing by removing pa of his brain.

11:19.000 --> 11:19.870
That sounds barbaric.

11:19.990 --> 11:20.560
I know.

11:20.690 --> 11:21.940
I would've just removed his hands.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.340
Anyway,less luck on the hostage taker.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.360
He signed in the hospital lobby
as "michael H.

11:26.390 --> 11:27.640
" Okay. Well,that's something,right?

11:27.660 --> 11:29.780
Except there have been at least 50
"michael h's" either visit

11:30.100 --> 11:31.990
or be admitted in the last six months.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.510
There are over a hundred michael h's
in the new york area.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.700
There's no time to check them all out.

11:35.940 --> 11:37.410
It could soon be over anyway.

11:38.030 --> 11:38.880
move out!

11:40.860 --> 11:42.260
crap.

11:42.780 --> 11:43.950
Right here!Go!

11:44.550 --> 11:46.810
come out with your hands up!

11:50.090 --> 11:53.660
if one cop comes in,I'm shooting all
the hostages!

11:56.480 --> 11:57.580
hold your positions!

11:58.120 --> 11:59.250
Hold your positions!

11:59.750 --> 12:01.140
The hostage taker,michael H.

12:01.170 --> 12:01.880
- He knew my name.

12:02.010 --> 12:04.200
He said I had to do something,but
I don't know what.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.110
I know.

12:05.270 --> 12:07.860
I'm a self-absorbed,self-obsessed lunatic,
and you're tired of my ravings,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.170
and I don't blame you. But I believe
I'm in a coma...

12:10.760 --> 12:12.640
or I'm insane and I think I'm in a coma.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.940
I have to get a sign to my loved ones
by 2:00,

12:15.140 --> 12:16.470
or I won't make it past today.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.460
Sam,you needing some psychic sign and

12:18.680 --> 12:21.580
saving these hostages have nothing to
do with each other.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.740
What if they're the same thing,and I'm
not trying hard enough?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.120
Take it.

12:27.290 --> 12:27.890
What?

12:28.290 --> 12:28.850
Take it.

12:29.000 --> 12:29.850
Do you want to die?

12:30.470 --> 12:31.070
No.

12:31.730 --> 12:32.630
I wanna live.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.160
Get down,you idiot!

12:42.770 --> 12:43.760
hold your fire!

12:44.000 --> 12:44.920
Hold your fire!

12:47.570 --> 12:48.720
I'm unarmed!

12:48.900 --> 12:49.710
Michael?

12:50.020 --> 12:50.720
Mike?

12:50.740 --> 12:52.030
Don't shoot. Okay?

12:52.150 --> 12:55.660
Don't hurt the hostages,and I promise
these guys won't come in.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.290
I'm detective sam tyler from the 1-2-5.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.100
You have my word. Okay?

13:02.180 --> 13:04.150
Even better- you can have me.

13:04.185 --> 13:05.115
Just let me in,

13:05.150 --> 13:08.190
'cause cops aren't gonna mess with you
if you're holding one of their own,right?

13:08.270 --> 13:10.865
So... how about it?We have a deal?

13:10.900 --> 13:14.150
Tyler,if you don't stand down,I'll
shoot you myself!

13:19.200 --> 13:20.600
come inside.

14:09.090 --> 14:12.000
down the hallway to your right.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.980
shut the door!

14:41.020 --> 14:43.470
Where's the machine I asked for

14:43.770 --> 14:45.120
I'm here to help,

14:45.250 --> 14:48.900
to work this out without anyone
getting killed. -Where is my machine?!

14:49.120 --> 14:50.340
Where is my machine?

14:50.430 --> 14:51.910
It's on its way,michael.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.360
Is that dr. Schwahn?

14:54.430 --> 14:55.580
Oh,you're acquainted?

14:55.650 --> 14:56.330
Good.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.270
He's the one asking for the machine.

14:58.290 --> 15:01.570
He needs it to do an operation what
kind of operation?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.410
Why don't you tell him,doc?

15:03.620 --> 15:05.610
tell him what you did to my brother-

15:05.720 --> 15:06.795
my perfect kid brother-

15:06.830 --> 15:09.390
- perfect except for a tweak in his brain.

15:09.420 --> 15:10.980
Schiphrenia,they said.

15:11.460 --> 15:12.430
Schizophrenia?

15:12.590 --> 15:14.560
I didn't mind taking care of him...

15:15.810 --> 15:17.560
but he didn't want to be a burden to me,

15:17.700 --> 15:21.030
so he went to see dr. Schwahn for help.

15:21.390 --> 15:23.830
You wanna see what he did to my kid brother?

15:25.610 --> 15:28.670
Bilateral cingulotomy.

15:28.910 --> 15:32.700
Fried his brains four years he's been like this.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.470
But as soon as that E.E.G.Machine gets here,

15:35.630 --> 15:38.260
dr. Schwahn is gonna correchis mistake.

15:38.390 --> 15:39.440
Ain't you,doc?

15:39.710 --> 15:41.910
Ain't you gonna fix my little brother?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.030
hello?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.520
Seems we got off on the wrong foot.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.010
To show you there's no hard feelings,
I'm sending in that machine you asked for.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.520
Okay,put it in the emergency bay.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.165
Now how about some reciprocity?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.670
Let one of the hostages go.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.920
I'll let everyone go,

16:03.380 --> 16:07.580
but I want a bus-a big bus- in the
parking lot behind the hospital,

16:07.760 --> 16:10.010
ady to go at 2:00 P.M.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.420
That's not gon happen.

16:11.630 --> 16:12.990
You shot at the police,michael.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.020
I can't get you a pony ride to midtown.

16:15.210 --> 16:16.320
Good-bye,lieutenant.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.970
Wait,wait,then let me speak to
detective tyler,

16:19.230 --> 16:20.510
just to make sure he's all right.

16:22.410 --> 16:23.940
He wants to talk to you.

16:27.330 --> 16:28.010
Hi,gene.

16:28.050 --> 16:31.630
- I'm gonna shove my fist so far down
your windpipe - yeah,I'm fine,I'm fine.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.540
So are the other 12 patients and
staff and dr. Schwahn.

16:34.690 --> 16:37.130
But it's getting kind of hot in here,
though,with the sun coming in.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.090
How's our friend doing?

16:40.220 --> 16:41.930
I'd take his demands seriously.

16:42.130 --> 16:42.930
He's no psycho.

16:43.110 --> 16:43.900
Enough.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.530
there are 13 other hostages,and they're
in the east-facing wing.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.210
There.

16:50.390 --> 16:52.470
Well,that could be the,uh,pediatric floor.

16:52.630 --> 16:55.510
Offices,psych ward- that's it.

16:55.650 --> 16:56.370
Psych ward.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.690
I'll get E.S.S.Ready.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.609
It's all gonna be fine.

17:05.890 --> 17:09.290
You're gonna ride the train,the traito
good times.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.710
Have you thought about how all this is
gonna end?

17:11.819 --> 17:15.200
There hasn't been a successful standoff
escape in this city ever.

17:15.339 --> 17:18.400
So I'm asking you,do you know how it's
gonna end?

17:18.550 --> 17:19.890
Let me tell you a story.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.480
A few years...

17:21.849 --> 17:23.950
after johnny's operation,

17:24.079 --> 17:25.410
one monday night,

17:26.030 --> 17:28.470
instead of watching the game with my brother,

17:28.600 --> 17:33.440
which was our thing,

17:33.600 --> 17:35.490
I'm spoon-feeding him applesauce,like I
used to do when he was a baby.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.700
That about killed me.

17:36.730 --> 17:41.200
Then I start seeing dr. Schwahn again in
all these magazines,

17:41.360 --> 17:43.660
saying how,with new technology,

17:43.820 --> 17:48.500
putting electrodes in the brain and stuff,
that he could fix almost anything.

17:49.080 --> 17:53.110
So I ask him to try again with
jony,make him...

17:56.280 --> 17:58.040
more the way he used to be.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.590
Turns out...

18:01.920 --> 18:03.570
he didn't want to do it.

18:06.050 --> 18:10.290
Dr. Schwahn needed a little persuading.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.270
You can't be serious.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.940
I'm serious all right.

18:13.070 --> 18:14.920
They think they're gonna nail
me to the tree?

18:15.030 --> 18:15.980
Let 'em try.

18:28.660 --> 18:31.440
everything in the psych ward is locked
down,even the phones.

18:32.030 --> 18:33.440
I'm not crazy.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.950
Classic crazy person line,I know,but...

18:36.320 --> 18:40.770
I'm erica filipi,reporter for the
"new york post.

18:41.660 --> 18:42.760
" Detective sam tyler.

18:42.900 --> 18:43.740
I'm undercover,

18:43.870 --> 18:46.080
researching the mistreatment of
psych ward patients,

18:46.230 --> 18:49.860
but now it's sort of an insider
account on a hostage standoff.

18:49.990 --> 18:50.780
What do you knowabout michael?

18:50.930 --> 18:53.020
Well,he visits johnny every day,

18:53.430 --> 18:57.020
always brings him a big box of
games and stuff every time,

18:57.170 --> 18:58.900
trying to get a response from him.

18:59.210 --> 19:02.430
poor jerk. I mean,even the crazies knew.

19:02.570 --> 19:04.890
Johnny wasn't playing monopoly anytime soon.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.420
Michael keeps taking off.

19:06.610 --> 19:07.810
You know where he disappears to?

19:07.960 --> 19:09.010
South of the slot.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.490
What?

19:11.260 --> 19:13.120
South of the slot...

19:15.230 --> 19:18.300
where the lizards play on saxophones,

19:18.700 --> 19:22.430
and the old men suck on otter bones.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.240
Get away from the door!

19:44.900 --> 19:47.100
do you think he knows he's going to die?

19:48.440 --> 19:49.770
mama!

19:53.350 --> 19:54.760
maybe he can hear you.

19:55.020 --> 19:55.700
Maya?

19:55.840 --> 19:57.890
oh,I'm afraid he can't hear or
feel anything.

19:58.150 --> 20:02.820
as you can see,his brain activity is
practically zero.

20:03.390 --> 20:06.800
You know,the best thing you can do
for him is just let him go.

20:06.920 --> 20:07.650
Doctor!

20:07.780 --> 20:08.630
Doctor!

20:18.430 --> 20:19.970
darling...

20:20.400 --> 20:21.380
yes?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.020
Darling,is that you?

20:23.150 --> 20:24.100
It's me.

20:25.360 --> 20:26.540
I'm right here.

20:29.190 --> 20:30.580
no,no.

20:30.790 --> 20:31.890
Don't go.

20:32.420 --> 20:33.430
No.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.860
Don't go.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.020
Don't leave.

20:40.850 --> 20:46.110
did you know the amc pacer is just
about as wide as a top-selling luxury car?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.980
It feels big even though it isn't,

20:48.120 --> 20:52.250
and I feel like I'm in a big car
even though I'm not.

20:52.380 --> 20:58.320
Amc pacer- it feels like a big
car,but it isn'T.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.550
You can't fix johnny.

21:00.700 --> 21:01.970
Why did you tell michaelyou could?

21:02.090 --> 21:04.990
'Cause the man is as strong as an ox
and dumb as one,and he had a bomb.

21:05.110 --> 21:05.810
What would you have said?

21:05.950 --> 21:07.070
Michael's not dumb.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.050
He's angry.

21:08.190 --> 21:09.480
You lobotomized his brother.

21:09.630 --> 21:12.180
And if I were johnny,I'd want someone
like thatlooking out for me.

21:12.310 --> 21:13.110
It had to be done.

21:13.220 --> 21:14.460
Johnny was hallucinating.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.530
He was hearing voices.

21:15.630 --> 21:17.950
Have you any idea what that's like?

21:18.120 --> 21:19.540
I saw you speaking to erica.

21:19.660 --> 21:20.840
Did she tell you why she's in here?

21:20.970 --> 21:24.800
Did she say she was an actress researching
a role or that she's a newspaper reporter?

21:24.930 --> 21:28.400
Erica is in here because she thought
kgb agents were in her home,

21:28.720 --> 21:31.820
so she started a fire,killing her
entire family...

21:32.270 --> 21:33.760
even the dog.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.010
Delusional psychosis,detective.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.040
one can seem normal,then one
succumbs to fantasy-

21:39.430 --> 21:41.820
time travel,parallel dimensions,

21:41.980 --> 21:44.350
thinking the voice on the radio or
the tv is speaking to you.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.920
You wake up one day,and you've torched
your loved ones to a crisp.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.800
For erica and for people like erica,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.250
there is no happy ending,detective.!

21:58.480 --> 21:59.920
the machine's on its way.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.170
I got the supplies you wanted.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.220
that's it.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.070
we're heading to the surgical bay.

22:16.750 --> 22:20.150
no. Relax. Don't do anything stupid.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.730
no,no,no,no.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.320
No.

22:35.410 --> 22:36.800
nostay away from him!

22:36.930 --> 22:37.980
Don't die on mE.

22:38.700 --> 22:39.640
Stay away!

22:39.840 --> 22:41.230
we're all in this together.

22:41.370 --> 22:42.990
No one dies today.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.680
wake up,sam.

22:52.220 --> 22:53.610
Maya?

22:55.280 --> 22:57.030
wake up,sam.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.150
wake up,princess.

23:00.350 --> 23:01.480
What are you doing here?

23:01.600 --> 23:03.910
the loot told michael H.That he would
send in a nurse.

23:04.050 --> 23:07.870
And a tech to operate the E.E.G.Machine
he wanted.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.510
I need some hands here!

23:11.340 --> 23:12.150
how's he doing?

23:12.260 --> 23:13.190
How does it look like he's doing?

23:13.290 --> 23:15.440
He needs a surgical team. He needs it soon.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.180
E.S.S.Is set to come in.

23:18.310 --> 23:21.030
We stashed three guns in the back of
that machine.

23:21.190 --> 23:23.910
You and i will cover the hostages
when this goes down.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.630
Gene,he has a bomb- dynamite strapped
to his chest.

23:27.730 --> 23:30.050
He can't detonate a bomb with a bullet
in his brain.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.230
So... we're gonna shoot him?That's the plan?

23:32.840 --> 23:34.790
Okay,okay,that's a good plan.

23:38.370 --> 23:39.870
Or maybe not.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.670
Okay,we-we have to warn ray and
E.S.S.About the bomb.

23:44.150 --> 23:47.030
Annie has brought a little something
to the party,too.

23:48.340 --> 23:49.590
It's a janitor key.

23:49.650 --> 23:51.270
It'll get you out of the ward,but michael H.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.670
Locked the stairwells and the elevators
when he brought us up.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.810
I saw a break room,and there were no
bars on the windows.

23:56.950 --> 23:57.820
What are we waiting for?

23:57.970 --> 23:58.500
Okay.

23:58.770 --> 23:59.870
Be right back.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.520
Miss,could you apply pressure here?

24:04.250 --> 24:06.350
When you get out,tell ray that michael H.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.030
Has about 12 sticks of dynamite on him,

24:08.170 --> 24:10.750
and he has to be isolated before E.S.S.Comes in.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.130
Here it is.

24:14.910 --> 24:16.250
What the hell is this?

24:16.370 --> 24:17.330
Explosives.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.200
I- I don't-I don't understand.

24:19.380 --> 24:20.100
The room was here.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.980
There was a-a window and a radio playing...

24:24.100 --> 24:26.380
some song.

24:27.670 --> 24:30.660
I got ray and a dozen guys about to charge in here

24:30.730 --> 24:33.370
and put their lives on the line based
on information you gave us.

24:33.450 --> 24:35.030
Now isot the time for crazy talk.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.290
Is there a way out or not?

24:36.400 --> 24:37.250
I don't know.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.530
sam!Sam!- annie!

24:41.820 --> 24:43.230
You hid the guns in the machine.

24:43.480 --> 24:47.870
I cooperate with the police,and this
is how I'm repaid?£¡

24:47.970 --> 24:49.780
You sneak two of your own in here
to kill me?£¡

24:49.930 --> 24:51.750
Well,I am done playing games!

24:52.840 --> 24:53.980
Get that off of her.

24:54.090 --> 24:54.670
Gene,don'T.

24:54.790 --> 24:57.530
You're a pretty tough guy for a
medical technician,ain't ya?

24:57.630 --> 24:59.010
Get that off of her.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.670
Pretty tough for a glorified nurse!

25:01.780 --> 25:04.720
All right,we all just need to relax
for a minute.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.610
I'm gettin' nowhere with your
friends out there.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.440
I thought maybe you could help me out...

25:10.360 --> 25:12.630
with the right motivation.

25:13.630 --> 25:15.020
My demands.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.340
Want them all met,

25:18.550 --> 25:22.650
or they're gonna get a taste of what's
gonna happen to each and every hostage.

25:22.810 --> 25:23.950
Call.

25:25.150 --> 25:27.430
Go. Go.

25:28.120 --> 25:28.800
Hello?

25:29.170 --> 25:30.260
Ray,listen carefully.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.800
I'm nna read out michael H.'S new
list of demands,

25:32.930 --> 25:34.910
and you gotta make good on every
single one of 'em.

25:35.050 --> 25:35.860
Like hell I do.

25:35.990 --> 25:36.770
I got E.S.S.

25:36.930 --> 25:38.370
Ready to bust in and nail this guy.

25:38.610 --> 25:40.140
Ray,you need to listen to me.

25:40.380 --> 25:41.870
Listen to a renegade whack job?

25:42.020 --> 25:43.000
I don't think so.

25:47.270 --> 25:48.720
Is that annie?

25:52.140 --> 25:53.410
All right,I'm listening.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.670
He wants a bus by 2:00 P.M.

25:55.930 --> 26:00.970
The bus will take him,his brother
and the hostages to the airport.

26:01.170 --> 26:02.630
I'm gonna crusyou to death.

26:02.690 --> 26:06.970
I'm gonna crush you like a bug-
like a big,fat bug.

26:07.050 --> 26:09.100
And he wants a plane there,gassed up,

26:09.270 --> 26:14.230
with a pilot who'll fly him and his
brother to the destination of his choice.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.280
Is the boss okay with all this?

26:15.620 --> 26:16.810
gene?

26:19.620 --> 26:20.810
You okay with this,loot?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.070
Give him what he needs.

26:22.190 --> 26:23.580
All right,I'll get the damn buS.

26:23.690 --> 26:27.310
I'll get the mn plane- just in time
to fly his cold corpse right to the morgue.

26:27.450 --> 26:29.060
My thoughts exactly.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.210
Off the phone.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.750
Done.

26:42.810 --> 26:43.730
You okay?

26:45.060 --> 26:48.010
Compared to him,I'm doing great.

26:48.150 --> 26:49.390
I'm sorry.

26:50.310 --> 26:51.560
It's my fault you're in here.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.200
I came in because I was asked.

26:53.260 --> 26:56.630
I wasn't fetching coffee or filing papers.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.070
I t to be a real cop.

26:58.220 --> 26:59.550
I'm still sorry.

27:00.470 --> 27:04.580
I was feeling everything coming down
around me.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.670
so I came in here looking for answers,but...

27:08.260 --> 27:09.970
I- I...

27:10.210 --> 27:12.570
I don't know what's real anymore.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.460
In my clinic work,

27:16.050 --> 27:20.590
I met a paranoid schizophrenic who had
learned to live without his meds and his treatment.

27:20.620 --> 27:25.460
And he said whenever he felt the walls
really starting to cave in,

27:25.590 --> 27:28.550
he would remember his happiest memory,

27:28.680 --> 27:30.920
because at least that was real.

27:37.510 --> 27:39.170
I remember...

27:39.260 --> 27:43.660
this one night,um,back in... hyde.

27:43.810 --> 27:47.060
My partner had recently gotten kled
making a collar.

27:49.270 --> 27:55.060
And I just ended a relationship with a
woman I thought I loved.

27:55.560 --> 28:01.210
I was in a bar,and there was a tom waits
song playing on the jukebox.

28:02.220 --> 28:03.180
You know tom waits?

28:03.690 --> 28:04.970
Is he popular yet?

28:05.140 --> 28:06.110
I never heard of him.

28:06.250 --> 28:09.660
He's soon to become "the patron saint of
the sad and downtrodden new yorker.

28:09.830 --> 28:13.770
" Anyway,there I was,and this girl...

28:13.930 --> 28:15.380
walks right up to the bar.

28:15.510 --> 28:17.810
And she turns to me,and she says,

28:19.030 --> 28:20.920
"why the glum face?

28:21.040 --> 28:22.590
"Summer is turning into fall.

28:22.720 --> 28:23.920
You can smell it in the air.

28:24.010 --> 28:27.520
"And you're sitting in a bar "with the
best jukebox in manhattan,

28:27.700 --> 28:33.830
"and dalton here is a bartender "whose
cocktail shaker should be bronzed.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.830
"It's time for livin'.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.680
Oh,and by the way,I'm your new partner.

28:40.860 --> 28:42.210
" Maya.

28:44.170 --> 28:46.770
It was the first time I saw her.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.330
I guess she was right.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.880
It was time for livin'.

28:51.910 --> 28:55.100
You got all that crap churning in your head.

28:55.220 --> 28:57.570
No wonder you're seeing things.

28:57.690 --> 28:59.450
How long you been feeling like that?

28:59.580 --> 29:00.130
Like what?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.350
Like it's you against the world.

29:02.830 --> 29:03.670
I guess...

29:03.790 --> 29:05.920
since I got to the 1-2-5.

29:09.430 --> 29:12.000
now being a loon is one thing.

29:12.160 --> 29:17.150
But this is the first I'm hearing about
your dissatisfaction on being on my squad.

29:17.230 --> 29:18.190
That's not what I meant.

29:18.330 --> 29:19.240
You're alone.

29:19.390 --> 29:20.960
Are you alone now?

29:21.050 --> 29:27.730
I should've left you here and let that
creep use you for target practic

29:31.210 --> 29:32.450
it's time.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.580
what's your plan?

29:35.880 --> 29:37.410
I will stimulate the amygdala

29:37.630 --> 29:41.090
so that it looks like there's brain
activity on the E.E.G.. -and then what?

29:41.180 --> 29:44.110
By the time johnny's recovered and michael
realizes it didn't work,

29:44.250 --> 29:46.430
hopefull this will all over.

29:46.930 --> 29:48.520
Isn't that dangerous?

29:48.690 --> 29:50.570
Johnny'smind is barely alive as it is.

29:50.605 --> 29:52.380
You have a better plan?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.360
you're gonna be better soon.

29:57.470 --> 29:59.740
I told you I'd always look out for ya.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.040
I can't believe he's going through with this,

30:04.980 --> 30:06.380
here you go.

30:11.390 --> 30:12.940
Get going.

30:28.090 --> 30:29.410
stop.

30:30.130 --> 30:31.310
this is not gonna work.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.250
What are you talking about?

30:33.260 --> 30:35.160
This operation,it's not gonna bring johnny
back. you know that.

30:35.290 --> 30:37.080
Keep going. Go.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.430
Do it.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.020
what you're about to do is not helping johnny.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.270
It's hurting him,michael.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.120
Shut your mouth!

30:47.240 --> 30:48.820
it's not gonna change the truth.

30:49.020 --> 30:49.755
Stop!

30:49.790 --> 30:51.020
listen to him!

30:51.040 --> 30:52.730
- Stop talking! -It's gonna fix your brother!

30:52.765 --> 30:53.660
- Not like this! -Stop!Stop,please!

30:53.720 --> 30:56.530
- I'm gonna kill you,you son of a bitch!
- Stop,please! Please!

30:56.565 --> 30:58.130
he's right!He's right!

30:58.890 --> 31:02.340
I can't iT.I can't help your brother.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.830
But you said...

31:07.510 --> 31:09.990
you said that you could.

31:10.200 --> 31:14.060
There's nothing that me or anybody else
can do to bring your brother back.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.020
I tried to tell you that.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.390
You wouldn't listen.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.640
We're taking a walk,kids.

31:26.810 --> 31:30.610
Let's go,across the yellow brick road
and down the rabbit hole.

31:34.110 --> 31:35.580
How did you know my name?

31:35.920 --> 31:37.890
On the phone earlier today.

31:38.150 --> 31:39.950
You said,"you're running out of time,sam.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.650
" I didn't know your name.

31:42.340 --> 31:45.380
That doesn't matter,'cause you're
not sam anymore.

31:45.540 --> 31:48.940
You're me,and i am sam.

31:55.390 --> 31:56.340
All right,let's go.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.560
Let's go,let's go,let's go.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.970
We stay together in a close group,and
we'll all get on that bus.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.150
We're almost to the end,folks.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.390
Okay,let's do it. Come on.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.050
Go,go,go.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.000
You'll all be free soon enough,

32:11.300 --> 32:13.180
and I'll be south of the slot.

32:20.010 --> 32:21.630
How good are these snipers?

32:21.810 --> 32:24.790
My best guy can shoot a dime off your
nose at 100 yards.

32:24.910 --> 32:25.800
Then when they exit,

32:25.930 --> 32:31.920
you tell your best guy that scazed muldoon
is wearing two nickels for a necktie.

32:49.740 --> 32:50.590
right there!

32:50.640 --> 32:52.460
Get down!Get down!

32:52.500 --> 32:56.780
drop it! drop it! drop it...

33:00.420 --> 33:02.260
hold your fire!

33:03.310 --> 33:04.500
Come on. Get up!

33:05.310 --> 33:06.290
All right,let's go,let's go!

33:06.460 --> 33:07.560
That's tyler.

33:07.740 --> 33:08.600
It's tyler!

33:08.770 --> 33:10.500
The building is rigged with explosives.

33:10.550 --> 33:14.240
- Evacuatehe area. Everybody back.
- move,move. go back!

33:14.290 --> 33:15.500
- Where is he? -he's not here!

33:16.120 --> 33:18.380
- let's go,people. -everybody,get back.

33:18.410 --> 33:20.300
- Move it out! -Sam,where are you doing?

33:22.440 --> 33:23.580
Michael!

33:25.190 --> 33:27.110
Michael,where are you?

33:35.410 --> 33:36.770
Johnny?

33:36.920 --> 33:38.560
How you doing,champ?

33:39.010 --> 33:40.450
How's he doin'?

33:40.630 --> 33:42.110
He's doin' fine.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.110
He's south of the slot.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.480
The building was supposedo be empty,

33:47.680 --> 33:49.270
the hostages driven safely away.

33:49.420 --> 33:52.690
I'd set off the explosives as a distraction.

33:52.980 --> 33:55.740
This tunnel leads to the 63rd street line£¬

33:55.775 --> 33:58.210
the subway to penn station.

33:58.300 --> 34:02.170
We take the 3:00 train to buffalo...

34:02.320 --> 34:04.970
then to canada. We would be gone.

34:05.150 --> 34:06.160
He'd get better.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.580
We'd spend the days fishing and the
nights watching football,

34:10.010 --> 34:12.230
but I can't go to jail.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.639
his responses are weaker than ever.

34:22.409 --> 34:25.120
whatever limited reality he's
in will end soon.

34:25.969 --> 34:28.840
I can't have johnny being treated
like a damn baby.

34:29.190 --> 34:31.030
I'm ending this.

34:33.389 --> 34:35.670
Your brother is in there somewhere,

34:35.790 --> 34:39.830
and believe me,that counts for something.

34:41.060 --> 34:42.710
Step aside.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.760
You're gonna have to go through me.

34:44.909 --> 34:46.580
You can save yourself.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.190
They're probably not your friends.

35:13.390 --> 35:15.290
why such the glum face?

35:15.470 --> 35:16.660
Summer's turning into fall.

35:16.850 --> 35:18.170
You can smell it in the air.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.010
And you are sittin' in a bar with
the best jukebox in manhattan,

35:23.160 --> 35:28.310
and dalton here- dalton is a bartender
whose cocktail shaker should be bronzed.

35:30.730 --> 35:32.660
It's time for livin'.

35:33.540 --> 35:37.160
Oh,by the way,I'm your new partner.

35:49.430 --> 35:53.960
he's smiling. He's smiling. He's smiling.

36:03.810 --> 36:05.480
On the floor!

36:13.920 --> 36:17.780
gene?I was supposed to die today,not you.

36:18.340 --> 36:20.860
Hey,do you smell whiskey?

36:24.150 --> 36:25.480
gene?

36:29.820 --> 36:32.080
holy cow!

36:32.190 --> 36:34.490
what are the chances?

36:34.610 --> 36:36.070
Actually...

36:37.320 --> 36:39.020
pretty good.

36:44.640 --> 36:48.190
I didn't know how long this hostage
crap was gonna go on.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.790
you gonna be okay!

36:58.960 --> 37:00.080
You gonna be okay!

37:08.870 --> 37:11.260
he was gone before they could get to him.

37:15.310 --> 37:17.880
I was supposed to die 2:00.

37:18.100 --> 37:21.350
Now he's dead,and I'm alive.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.980
you're alive,sam.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.700
Can't you let it go?

37:29.230 --> 37:30.700
despite the harrowing events,

37:30.910 --> 37:35.430
the police managed to apprehend the
gunman and get the hostages to safety with only one casualty.

37:35.630 --> 37:38.290
Overall,a resounding success for
the boys in blue.

37:40.830 --> 37:43.140
They're talking about us on the radio!

37:43.270 --> 37:44.680
I... I gotta call my mom.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.210
I gotta call my mom.

37:52.120 --> 37:58.060
sorry I almost got your head blown off.

37:59.450 --> 38:00.770
Is gene making you apologize?

38:00.880 --> 38:04.280
No,that was a spontaneous eruption
of my true sentiment.

38:05.070 --> 38:09.030
You know,you don't have to treat the
"crazy" cop with kid gloves.

38:09.560 --> 38:10.740
Good.

38:10.900 --> 38:13.550
'Cause I ain't that sorry,and I
still think you're a meatball.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.660
Right.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.510
You know something,tyler?

38:16.550 --> 38:18.340
You're not so special.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.900
We all go crazy at some point.

38:21.010 --> 38:24.740
Happens to any cop who gives a
crap about what he does.

38:26.130 --> 38:27.900
That's why we're alcoholics.

38:28.830 --> 38:31.140
That's why our women leave us.

38:32.390 --> 38:34.780
We're broken toys.

38:36.550 --> 38:42.120
That is all what makes us different
from those folks in the psych ward...

38:43.370 --> 38:45.730
we keep each other sane.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.990
that's what it's about.

38:49.120 --> 38:56.840
Any decent precinct house-
we keep each other sane.

38:58.270 --> 39:00.120
he's right,spaceman.

39:01.110 --> 39:05.140
after all,we're an american band.

39:28.090 --> 39:32.240
I don't care what your tests say.
I saw him smile!

39:32.440 --> 39:34.870
I won't let you end his life,

39:35.060 --> 39:38.590
not while there's a chance my little
boy is still in there.

39:38.760 --> 39:39.550
Very well.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.240
We'll keep him on life support.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.010
But I think you're making a mistake.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.540
Are you adding peeping tom to the list
of your bizarre attributes,sam?

39:52.990 --> 39:54.590
whatas that for?

39:55.020 --> 39:58.930
For helping me remember something
happy,something real.

39:59.090 --> 40:00.440
That was the sign they needed.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.840
That's why I'm still alive.

40:02.030 --> 40:02.960
Thank you...

40:04.780 --> 40:06.680
for keeping an insane man...

40:07.110 --> 40:09.010
sane,annie.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.100
well,I was just heading in.

40:18.270 --> 40:19.610
I was just heading out.

40:19.780 --> 40:20.540
See you tomorrow?

40:20.700 --> 40:21.310
Tomorrow.

40:31.250 --> 40:34.940
Sam,I'm so glad you're still here.

40:37.220 --> 40:39.530
I'm not gonna let them pull the plug,sam,

40:39.940 --> 40:42.720
but I also don't think I can keep doing this.

40:43.750 --> 40:45.830
I'm so sorry.

40:45.970 --> 40:47.710
It's just...

40:49.690 --> 40:51.620
it's been months.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.970
I have to say good-bye.

41:00.930 --> 41:03.100
I've got to let you go.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.540
It's time for living.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
