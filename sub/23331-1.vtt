00:05.436 --> 00:08.371
I committed my first
major felony when I was 10.

00:09.973 --> 00:12.441
I boosted my first
car when I was 11.

00:12.443 --> 00:15.410
By the time I was 13 it
was grand theft, robbery,

00:15.412 --> 00:17.445
assault with intent.

00:17.447 --> 00:19.514
I pulled a safe out of the
back wall of a pawn shop

00:19.516 --> 00:21.385
on my 17th birthday.

00:22.653 --> 00:24.854
When I was 23 a judge told me
I should stay out of trouble,

00:24.856 --> 00:26.122
keep my nose to the grindstone,

00:26.124 --> 00:28.991
this place was the
land of opportunity.

00:28.993 --> 00:31.459
Then he sentenced
me to four years.

00:31.461 --> 00:34.063
Fuckin' land of opportunity.

00:34.065 --> 00:37.432
Some people actually
believe that shit.

01:19.509 --> 01:22.177
So how bad do you wanna
get out of here, Jimmy?

01:22.179 --> 01:24.647
Take a wild fucking guess.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.849
I hear you got a
month left on your stretch,

01:26.851 --> 01:28.016
something like that.

01:28.018 --> 01:29.552
Four weeks, three days actually.

01:29.554 --> 01:31.686
Plus I owe another two
years once when I get out.

01:31.688 --> 01:33.555
Doesn't look to me like
you're gonna make it.

01:33.557 --> 01:36.225
That seems to be
the popular sentiment.

01:36.227 --> 01:37.927
Little problem
with the Aryan Brotherhood

01:37.929 --> 01:39.195
is the way I heard it.

01:39.197 --> 01:40.028
Fuck that.

01:40.030 --> 01:41.162
Fuck them.

01:41.164 --> 01:43.231
A bunch of pussies.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.166
And they go by the Army
of the White Dragon,

01:45.168 --> 01:46.569
not the Aryan Brotherhood.

01:46.571 --> 01:48.136
They're a little
sensitive about that.

01:48.138 --> 01:49.704
What's the beef?

01:49.706 --> 01:50.673
Who can say?

01:50.675 --> 01:53.508
This place is a fucking zoo.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.177
One day a couple of
convicts get the idea

01:55.179 --> 01:56.144
that you're gonna
move Nickel Deck

01:56.146 --> 01:58.213
for them up on their
tier, you tell 'em no.

01:58.215 --> 01:59.882
A couple of fuck
your mothers later,

01:59.884 --> 02:02.951
they're looking to fit
you with a prom dress.

02:02.953 --> 02:05.153
Not your cup of tea, I take it?

02:05.155 --> 02:07.790
Dress wasn't my size.

02:07.792 --> 02:11.259
I'm guessing the Aryans
weren't too happy about that.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.795
What can I say, Wayne?

02:12.797 --> 02:15.467
The male ego is a fragile thing.

02:16.634 --> 02:18.666
Lots of people move
junk into this place

02:18.668 --> 02:21.236
through the Aryans, Jimmy.

02:21.238 --> 02:25.075
Pull a couple strings
and see to it in 52 days

02:26.277 --> 02:30.515
you walk outta here instead
of getting carried out.

02:32.116 --> 02:33.949
Did I take a bullet for
you in another lifetime

02:33.951 --> 02:35.818
and I don't remember?

02:35.820 --> 02:38.056
Huh, what's the catch, Wayne?

02:42.125 --> 02:44.693
What's one night of your
life worth to you Jimmy?

02:46.831 --> 02:49.598
I'm still sitting here.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.800
But I hear the words toss and
salad in the same sentence,

02:51.802 --> 02:54.873
my ass is back in
general population.

02:56.273 --> 02:58.640
I'm talking about a job.

02:58.642 --> 03:00.876
One night's work, that's all.

03:00.878 --> 03:02.978
What kinda work?

03:02.980 --> 03:07.152
Well, considering that
I'm me and you're you,

03:08.285 --> 03:11.589
take a wild fucking
guess what kind of work.

03:13.690 --> 03:17.092
I don't push buttons
on guys, Wayne.

03:17.094 --> 03:18.997
You mean not anymore.

03:20.697 --> 03:22.765
I know the crew?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.202
Does it matter?

03:25.802 --> 03:27.703
New outfit, money
from down South.

03:27.705 --> 03:29.837
A guy named Nesto Diaz.

03:29.839 --> 03:30.839
Nesto Diaz.

03:32.108 --> 03:33.943
Last I heard he was down
in fucking South Gate

03:33.945 --> 03:37.580
pulling drive-by's
with Romeo Mendoza.

03:37.582 --> 03:41.050
Since when do you broker
work for the Barrio Boys?

03:41.052 --> 03:42.884
Since Romeo got
shanked in county

03:42.886 --> 03:46.789
by one of the 8th Street
Orientes a couple years back.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.758
Barrio Boys are dead
as disco, Jimmy.

03:49.760 --> 03:53.628
It's a new ballgame and
Diaz is calling the plays.

03:53.630 --> 03:54.997
So he was lookin' for somebody

03:54.999 --> 03:57.903
and my name just
magically pops up?

03:59.769 --> 04:01.106
Fuck off, Wayne.

04:02.206 --> 04:04.743
This ain't a social call, Jimmy.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.648
I'm here 'cause Nesto
called your number.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.587
I got a job, I do it.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.952
No reason to get nasty.

04:17.954 --> 04:20.055
Why don't you go ask Lloyd?

04:20.057 --> 04:22.658
Lloyd doesn't have the toolbox.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.759
Not like yours, Jimmy.

04:23.761 --> 04:24.959
Toolbox for what?

04:24.961 --> 04:26.894
This mysterious whatever
it is you maybe want

04:26.896 --> 04:27.829
- me to do?
- Lloyd's the one

04:27.831 --> 04:30.098
who gave you to us, Jimmy.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.901
And they say loyalty's dead.

04:32.903 --> 04:35.069
Got him out from
under Diaz apparently.

04:35.071 --> 04:36.105
He owes him?

04:36.107 --> 04:37.338
Everybody does.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.742
He's been buying up debt.

04:39.744 --> 04:41.810
The American way.

04:41.812 --> 04:43.077
One night.

04:43.079 --> 04:46.749
You do this, Diaz says
you're free and clear.

04:46.751 --> 04:47.751
You don't,

04:48.785 --> 04:50.252
I don't know,

04:50.254 --> 04:51.987
I guess the Aryans paint
you with Revlon number five

04:51.989 --> 04:55.023
and stick a shank in your ear.

04:55.025 --> 04:56.860
So what's it gonna be?

05:02.066 --> 05:03.602
I'm listening.

05:10.006 --> 05:12.841
♪ Frankie and Johnny

05:12.843 --> 05:15.778

Jimmy.

06:08.032 --> 06:09.032
Lou.

06:09.734 --> 06:11.834
When did you get out?

06:11.836 --> 06:13.071
This morning.

06:14.739 --> 06:17.372
You don't live
here anymore, Jimmy.

06:17.374 --> 06:18.439
Come on, Lou.

06:18.441 --> 06:19.273
Open the door.

06:19.275 --> 06:20.108
I'm not doing this.

06:20.110 --> 06:20.942
Open the door.

06:20.944 --> 06:22.478
What if I don't?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
Well then I'll take this
door right off the hinges.

06:27.451 --> 06:28.884
Just go away.

06:28.886 --> 06:30.418
Okay, my P.O. says I get caught

06:30.420 --> 06:33.889
consorting with any known
felons he'll put me away.

06:33.891 --> 06:37.358
Or I have to suck him off,
I can't remember which.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.196
That's cute.

06:40.864 --> 06:42.096
What do you want?

06:42.098 --> 06:43.031
Come on.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.266
I've been out three hours.

06:44.268 --> 06:45.434
This is the first place
I've been to, come on.

06:45.436 --> 06:46.235
You mean after you bought a gun?

06:46.237 --> 06:47.706
Uh-uh, look it.

06:48.805 --> 06:49.805
Clean.

06:51.475 --> 06:53.977
Two minutes, Lou, two minutes.

07:08.057 --> 07:10.292
So how was life on the inside?

07:10.294 --> 07:12.427
You could have came and
visited me and found out.

07:12.429 --> 07:13.862
You could
have written me a letter

07:13.864 --> 07:16.031
and told me about it.

07:16.033 --> 07:18.800
You still working at
that card club downtown?

07:18.802 --> 07:19.434
No.

07:19.436 --> 07:21.235
Not for a couple months.

07:21.237 --> 07:22.303
The owner got it in his head

07:22.305 --> 07:23.538
that part of my job description

07:23.540 --> 07:26.942
was giving him a blowjob in
the back seat of his Plymouth.

07:26.944 --> 07:29.043
I'm at the Circle 3 now.

07:29.045 --> 07:30.579
That Russian place?

07:30.581 --> 07:33.214
Czech, I think, or Ukrainian.

07:33.216 --> 07:36.117
These guys keep shooting each
other every five minutes.

07:36.119 --> 07:38.187
I can't keep track.

07:38.189 --> 07:40.855
I see you changed your hair.

07:40.857 --> 07:41.857
I like it.

07:43.059 --> 07:45.894
I get better tips as a brunette.

07:45.896 --> 07:47.898
What do you want, Jimmy?

07:50.567 --> 07:51.934
Just come by to say hi.

07:51.936 --> 07:53.100
Give me that.

07:53.102 --> 07:54.102
Gimme.

07:56.574 --> 07:57.605
That's new.

07:57.607 --> 07:58.507
Oh.

07:58.509 --> 08:00.242
I'm sorry, does
Doctor Frankenstein

08:00.244 --> 08:03.946
not like the way his
monster turned out?

08:03.948 --> 08:06.951
Aren't you being dramatic?

08:08.619 --> 08:09.619
Here, look.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.187
What the hell is this?

08:12.189 --> 08:13.792
Come on, open it.

08:15.893 --> 08:16.928
Jeez.

08:19.997 --> 08:21.629
See, I remember
when I got sent up

08:21.631 --> 08:23.432
you had to pawn that
one your mom gave you,

08:23.434 --> 08:24.533
so figured, you know...

08:24.535 --> 08:27.636
It was my
grandmother's, actually.

08:27.638 --> 08:29.605
And it was in her family
for 100 years before that.

08:29.607 --> 08:32.844
But gee Jimmy,
this is swell, too.

08:34.376 --> 08:36.311
Tell me, why do I get a feeling

08:36.313 --> 08:37.913
that there's some old lady

08:37.914 --> 08:39.914
on the Greyhound
down from Ironwood

08:39.916 --> 08:43.085
wondering what happened to
the chain around her neck?

08:43.087 --> 08:45.153
I see you're still
collecting these records, huh?

08:45.155 --> 08:46.654
Yeah.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.924
Yeah, I seem to have a
thing for anachronisms.

08:49.926 --> 08:52.293
Just like old times.

08:52.295 --> 08:55.297
I tee it up, you take a swing.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.900
Oh, look at that.

08:58.902 --> 09:00.504
Jimmy's go to move.

09:01.639 --> 09:04.673
Easy smile, self
deprecating remark.

09:04.675 --> 09:06.374
Look, if you're standing there

09:06.376 --> 09:08.277
waiting for me to suggest
that we go into the bedroom

09:08.279 --> 09:09.577
to fuck for old time's sake,

09:09.579 --> 09:12.980
you're gonna be standing
there a long time.

09:12.982 --> 09:15.182
What can I say, Lou?

09:15.184 --> 09:18.953
It's a slippery slope you
let a man come inside you.

09:18.955 --> 09:19.955
Fuck you.

09:22.226 --> 09:23.491
You know what I think?

09:23.493 --> 09:25.427
I think probation's
making you mean.

09:25.429 --> 09:27.229
That's what I think.

09:27.231 --> 09:30.164
No, I think it's
just you, Jimmy.

09:35.338 --> 09:37.706
If you don't have the stomach,

09:37.708 --> 09:40.011
the door's right there.

09:41.712 --> 09:45.147
I got something
set up down South.

09:45.149 --> 09:48.086
Other side of the
border, Veracruz.

09:49.486 --> 09:51.019
Veracruz?

09:51.021 --> 09:52.086
You mean Mexico?

09:52.088 --> 09:53.357
Yeah, Mexico.

09:54.391 --> 09:55.323
It's good.

09:55.325 --> 09:56.524
It's legitimate work, too.

09:56.526 --> 09:57.993
Legitimate work?

09:57.995 --> 09:58.726
Yeah, yeah.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.696
It's like 90% legitimate.

10:02.031 --> 10:03.565
Your first day out

10:03.567 --> 10:06.067
and you're already talking
about jumping your parole?

10:06.069 --> 10:08.370
Jesus, you're
predictable, Jimmy.

10:08.372 --> 10:11.072
I thought that was one of
the things you liked about me.

10:11.074 --> 10:11.974
Oh, yeah.

10:11.976 --> 10:13.741
There you go
understanding women again.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.644
Look, I'm just trying
to make a fresh start.

10:15.646 --> 10:17.312
Yeah, so what?

10:17.314 --> 10:18.647
Is that supposed to include me

10:18.649 --> 10:20.716
just dropping everything
and going with you?

10:20.718 --> 10:24.119
Oh, yeah, 'cause you built
yourself quite the life here.

10:24.121 --> 10:25.387
It's marvelous.

10:25.389 --> 10:26.221
I'm blown away.

10:26.223 --> 10:27.755
I'm so proud of you.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.390
Go to hell.

10:29.392 --> 10:31.293
Look, I had this cellmate.

10:31.295 --> 10:34.730
He's got this car service
down in Veracruz, right?

10:34.732 --> 10:36.264
We're driving high priced tricks

10:36.266 --> 10:38.066
back and forth to Mexico City.

10:38.068 --> 10:39.201
Little light muscle work.

10:39.203 --> 10:42.070
Says he's got a spot for me.

10:42.072 --> 10:44.740
Keep reaching for
those stars, Jimmy.

10:44.742 --> 10:47.042
I just gotta pay this debt
off and then we're gone.

10:47.044 --> 10:48.076
What, another safe?

10:48.078 --> 10:49.110
No.

10:49.112 --> 10:50.314
It's complicated.

10:54.751 --> 10:56.350
I'm not going.

10:56.352 --> 10:57.619
Pack your shit.

10:57.621 --> 10:59.020
You don't get to do this, Jimmy.

10:59.022 --> 11:00.187
- You're going.
- God damn it, Jimmy.

11:00.189 --> 11:01.023
I'm not fucking around.
You do not get

11:01.025 --> 11:02.023
to fucking do this!

11:02.025 --> 11:02.758
Do what?

11:02.760 --> 11:04.125
You just leave for four years

11:04.127 --> 11:04.793
and you think my
whole life just stops,

11:04.795 --> 11:06.128
is that what you think?

11:06.130 --> 11:07.229
What life, this fucking shit?

11:07.231 --> 11:08.163
Fuck you!

11:08.165 --> 11:09.130
This is your fucking life,

11:09.132 --> 11:10.065
- this shit?
- Fuck you!

11:10.067 --> 11:11.232
It's gonna fucking kill you,

11:11.234 --> 11:12.167
- is what it's gonna do.
- What, oh, oh?

11:12.169 --> 11:13.735
What the fuck do you care?

11:13.737 --> 11:17.241
Look, just pack your
shit, you're going.

11:19.043 --> 11:22.277
You never should've
come back, Jimmy.

11:22.279 --> 11:23.711
Look.

11:23.713 --> 11:26.280
You're all I got, okay?

11:26.282 --> 11:27.548
I did my four years.

11:27.550 --> 11:29.150
I am done, I am out.

11:29.152 --> 11:30.454
Period, that's it.

11:34.657 --> 11:36.660
Look, Jimmy, I'm tired

11:40.430 --> 11:44.001
and I'm still wearing
last night's mascara.

11:51.175 --> 11:53.176
Your two minutes are up.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.479
I'm gonna take a shower.

11:57.481 --> 12:00.081
You can let yourself out.

12:00.083 --> 12:01.549
I'm not going.

12:01.551 --> 12:02.753
Leave, Jimmy.

12:08.257 --> 12:09.256
Go!

12:09.258 --> 12:10.558
Get the fuck out of here!

12:10.560 --> 12:13.064
Leave me the fuck alone, okay?

12:53.804 --> 12:55.269
Very good.

12:55.271 --> 12:57.775
But you know I'm still hungry.

12:58.909 --> 13:00.307
Yeah?

13:00.309 --> 13:01.842
So am I.

13:01.844 --> 13:04.178
You don't have to do this.

13:04.180 --> 13:05.880
Winter's
coming, winter's coming.

13:05.882 --> 13:08.185
I gotta do something.

13:15.825 --> 13:16.827
What's this?

13:18.761 --> 13:20.828
I've been working a
grave shift at a Food Barn

13:20.830 --> 13:24.265
down in Belmont to keep
my head above water.

13:24.267 --> 13:26.503
Life's a cabaret, ain't it?

13:37.280 --> 13:40.782
There's gotta be more to
life than this, Jimmy.

13:40.784 --> 13:42.183
That ship's sailed.

13:42.185 --> 13:43.652
A terrible blizzard's coming.

13:43.654 --> 13:44.820
Ah, go on.

13:44.822 --> 13:46.554
That guy don't know a shadow
from a hole in the ground.

13:46.556 --> 13:47.891
Ship's sailed?

13:49.258 --> 13:50.192
That's it?

13:50.194 --> 13:51.793
You don't have a choice?

13:51.795 --> 13:53.327
You are what you are.

13:53.329 --> 13:54.528
The what don't change,

13:54.530 --> 13:56.764
just the where and the how.

13:56.766 --> 13:57.966
You get this bullshit

13:57.968 --> 14:00.501
out of a fucking
fortune cookie, Jimmy?

14:00.503 --> 14:03.538
Or is this you just pretending
that you've read a book?

14:03.540 --> 14:05.208
Jimmy Hill Senior.

14:06.443 --> 14:08.212
I need some wheels.

14:13.317 --> 14:14.637
It's the blue
Plymouth down front.

14:18.387 --> 14:19.653
All right.

14:19.655 --> 14:21.255
Pack up whatever you
wanna take with you.

14:21.257 --> 14:24.394
We're gonna be gone
in a couple of days.

14:25.295 --> 14:26.894
Unless you're dead.

14:26.896 --> 14:27.828
Come on.

14:27.830 --> 14:29.230
It could happen, right Jimmy?

14:29.232 --> 14:30.698
Tomorrow could come around

14:30.700 --> 14:33.301
and we could find you dead
in some fucking gutter

14:33.303 --> 14:34.302
with a fucking bullet

14:34.304 --> 14:35.269
- in your head!
- Okay, enough!

14:35.271 --> 14:39.176
You know what, just
forget it, Jimmy, okay?

14:40.343 --> 14:40.975
Do what you gotta do.

14:40.977 --> 14:42.479
I don't even care.

14:48.751 --> 14:52.189
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

14:55.592 --> 14:56.523
I made a deal,

14:56.525 --> 14:58.525
- Louly.
- So what?

14:58.527 --> 14:59.894
With who?

14:59.896 --> 15:01.363
That piece of shit
that who got you out?

15:01.365 --> 15:02.563
What, you don't think
he's gonna fuck you

15:02.565 --> 15:04.634
the first chance he gets?

15:05.968 --> 15:06.968
Lou.

15:15.011 --> 15:16.011
Jimmy.

15:20.016 --> 15:22.520
We could leave here right now.

15:26.723 --> 15:28.358
We could just go.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.597
I made a deal, Louly.

15:39.368 --> 15:41.605
You don't want me, Jimmy.

15:43.740 --> 15:46.908
You think you do, but you don't.

15:46.910 --> 15:47.910
Hey.

15:48.745 --> 15:49.745
Hey.

15:50.947 --> 15:52.450
Hey, listen to me.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.353
You're all I got.

15:57.587 --> 15:58.587
All right?

16:00.324 --> 16:02.892
So we're gonna
make a fresh start.

17:20.703 --> 17:22.470
What'd I tell ya, Jack?

17:22.472 --> 17:23.805
She's worth it, right?

17:23.807 --> 17:24.807
Total pro.

17:26.976 --> 17:29.479
Oh, yeah she's a real sport.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.414
How long have you guys
been married, Ronnie?

17:33.416 --> 17:35.048
Three years.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.017
Hm.

17:36.019 --> 17:38.452
Doesn't seem like the
healthiest relationship

17:38.454 --> 17:39.653
in the world, Ronnie.

17:39.655 --> 17:40.888
You know what?

17:40.890 --> 17:43.024
You and me, we had
a fucking agreement.

17:43.026 --> 17:44.592
I know, Jack.

17:44.594 --> 17:45.660
It's serious, man.

17:45.662 --> 17:46.827
Like right hand to God,

17:46.829 --> 17:48.195
the last thing I
wanna do in the world

17:48.197 --> 17:49.530
- was was come up short on you.
- Right hand to God.

17:49.532 --> 17:50.532
Jesus Christ.

17:51.867 --> 17:54.435
I'm your fucking P.O.,
I'm not your priest.

17:54.437 --> 17:55.470
Jack, man.

17:55.472 --> 17:56.770
I set you up with a job.

17:56.772 --> 17:59.207
400 bills a week, 150
of which you float me

17:59.209 --> 18:02.810
for not bouncing your
ass back up to Chino.

18:02.812 --> 18:06.983
And what do you do, lifetime
fuck up that you are?

18:15.692 --> 18:16.691
Hey.

18:16.693 --> 18:18.492
Is he gonna pay for that?

18:18.494 --> 18:19.794
Shut the hell up?

18:23.567 --> 18:25.866
Yeah, well, you managed
to get your ass fired,

18:25.868 --> 18:28.502
which means not only
are you in violation

18:28.504 --> 18:32.475
of the terms of your release,
I'm out 150 each week.

18:33.210 --> 18:34.409
Best you can do

18:34.411 --> 18:37.244
is let me throw a hump into
your fucking wife to make good?

18:39.182 --> 18:40.182
I'm busy.

18:41.550 --> 18:42.584
Yeah.

18:42.586 --> 18:43.218
No, no, no.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.152
Just listen.

18:44.154 --> 18:45.252
My dance card's full, alright?

18:45.254 --> 18:48.189
I got 22 habituals
the way it is.

18:48.191 --> 18:49.590
No, no, no.

18:49.592 --> 18:52.559
Don't fucking send
it, god damn it.

18:52.561 --> 18:53.561
Hey!

18:54.530 --> 18:57.832
Fuck.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.500
Jack.

18:59.502 --> 19:01.502
You just gotta give me a
little more time, all right?

19:01.504 --> 19:02.069
Two days.

19:02.071 --> 19:03.204
Three days max.

19:03.206 --> 19:07.444
In the meantime anytime you
get that itch, you know?

19:17.553 --> 19:18.252
Is she just gonna stand there

19:18.254 --> 19:20.957
and eyeball me all goddam day?

19:22.692 --> 19:24.558
Sorry.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.193
Get back in the goddamn room.

19:26.195 --> 19:27.862
Fuck you, Ronnie.

19:27.864 --> 19:29.631
Just go, god damn it.

19:29.633 --> 19:30.265
Well, fuck you.

19:30.267 --> 19:31.633
I'm fucking hungry!

19:31.635 --> 19:34.035
Get back in the
fucking room, all right?

19:34.037 --> 19:36.304
I'll get you some
Chick-fil-A later.

19:36.306 --> 19:37.575
You better.

19:38.274 --> 19:41.078
And don't forget my cigarettes.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.750
Hey, man, you play ball?

19:50.153 --> 19:51.184
Yeah.

19:51.186 --> 19:52.186
Jefferson.

19:53.022 --> 19:54.556
Been about six years ago.

19:54.558 --> 19:55.856
Corner?

19:55.858 --> 19:57.791
Strong safety.

19:57.793 --> 19:59.326
Put me both ways, too.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.596
They lined me up at tight end.

20:01.598 --> 20:04.265
I bet you were
fast as fuck, huh?

20:04.267 --> 20:05.098
4.6 40.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.200
No joke.

20:06.202 --> 20:07.671
Oh shit, 4.6?

20:09.039 --> 20:10.605
Bet you wish you
hadn't smoked away

20:10.607 --> 20:12.140
all that breakaway
speed when they got you

20:12.142 --> 20:15.676
on that liquor store
hold-up last year, huh?

20:15.678 --> 20:16.577
Yeah.

20:16.579 --> 20:18.078
I guess so.

20:18.080 --> 20:22.252
I was at Rochester, you
know, down South, CCL?

20:23.353 --> 20:25.319
Champs two times
back to back, 89, 90.

20:25.321 --> 20:26.621
Outside Linebacker.

20:26.623 --> 20:28.189
Bang!

20:28.191 --> 20:29.191
Yeah?

20:31.293 --> 20:35.198
Hey, man, why don't
you give me some privacy?

20:37.767 --> 20:39.103
Yo, Jack, man.

20:40.302 --> 20:41.704
This is my house.

20:42.739 --> 20:43.871
Yeah, you're right.

20:43.873 --> 20:46.106
You're right, Jack.

20:46.108 --> 20:49.210
Take your time, man,
whatever you need.

20:49.212 --> 20:51.645
Hey Lloyd, it's Jack Burbank.

20:51.647 --> 20:52.279
Yeah, yeah.

20:52.281 --> 20:53.247
No.

20:53.249 --> 20:55.782
Shut the fuck up and listen.

20:55.784 --> 20:56.750
Hey, hang on a second.

20:56.752 --> 20:59.287
Whoa, whoa, where you going?

20:59.289 --> 21:02.656
You said you
needed some privacy.

21:02.658 --> 21:03.658
Outside.

21:05.361 --> 21:07.730
I might go in for seconds.

21:12.268 --> 21:13.401
Yeah.

21:13.403 --> 21:14.738
Sure, Jack.

21:15.739 --> 21:18.742
Like I said, man,
whatever you need.

21:22.111 --> 21:23.279
Yeah, Lloyd.

21:24.414 --> 21:25.880
You're not gonna believe

21:25.882 --> 21:28.749
whose jacket I just
got assigned to me.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.417
No, no, I'll give you a hint.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.053
Last time you saw him

21:32.055 --> 21:35.288
you wanted to put a bullet
in his fucking head.

21:35.290 --> 21:36.290
No.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.661
No.

21:39.361 --> 21:40.294
No.

21:40.296 --> 21:41.729
Jesus Christ, how many guys

21:41.731 --> 21:43.664
have you tried to
fucking kill lately?

21:43.666 --> 21:46.267
No, I'm talking
about Jimmy Hill.

22:03.752 --> 22:04.885
Jesus.

22:04.887 --> 22:06.988
You must've been staring
into that light too long.

22:08.758 --> 22:09.757
Son of a bitch.

22:09.759 --> 22:10.759
Four years.

22:12.861 --> 22:13.928
When'd you get out?

22:13.930 --> 22:16.396
Just this morning.

22:16.398 --> 22:19.200
Jesus, you're on
the job already.

22:19.202 --> 22:20.971
Can we talk inside?

22:23.338 --> 22:27.340
Hayman RB-3 tri-bolt double
compartment floor safe.

22:27.342 --> 22:29.042
That's some heavy
iron right there, man.

22:29.044 --> 22:29.977
Yeah.

22:29.979 --> 22:31.712
What have you heard about it?

22:31.714 --> 22:32.446
You don't wanna know.

22:32.448 --> 22:33.480
You remember Pete Stanhill?

22:33.482 --> 22:34.315
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:34.317 --> 22:35.717
Guy from up North right?

22:35.719 --> 22:37.351
He used to pull steel
with Maxy Rydell.

22:37.353 --> 22:38.451
He's from Diamond Springs?

22:38.453 --> 22:41.021
Yeah, he used to call
that thing the widow maker

22:41.023 --> 22:45.094
on account of it pushed
so many guys off the job.

22:46.296 --> 22:48.962
You got the drill
point specs for it?

22:48.964 --> 22:50.030
Nobody does.

22:50.032 --> 22:51.465
Don't matter anyway.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.734
Thing's got that
resistive hard plate,

22:53.736 --> 22:54.702
cobalt alloy

22:54.704 --> 22:56.938
embedded with tungsten
carbide chips, man.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.342
Shatters the bit.

22:59.408 --> 23:00.374
If you had the time

23:00.376 --> 23:03.211
you could go in with
diamond core titanium.

23:03.213 --> 23:04.746
But even then you're
looking at a minimum six,

23:04.748 --> 23:06.380
seven hours before
you break through.

23:06.382 --> 23:08.883
Plus even if you
did break through,

23:08.885 --> 23:12.119
there's tempered glass
between the door and the lock.

23:12.121 --> 23:13.820
Wired edges.

23:13.822 --> 23:16.457
Glass breaks, it drops these
little spring loaded rods

23:16.459 --> 23:19.227
in front of the
main locking bolts.

23:19.229 --> 23:21.028
This box is the real deal, man.

23:21.030 --> 23:22.497
What about a plasma cutter?

23:25.401 --> 23:27.401
Thermal relocker.

23:27.403 --> 23:29.804
Temperature goes up, glass
breaks, rods drop in,

23:29.806 --> 23:31.475
same boat as before.

23:32.809 --> 23:34.407
You could maybe
use an auto dialer,

23:34.409 --> 23:37.377
but you're looking at 10
million possible combinations.

23:37.379 --> 23:39.279
You could be there a week.

23:39.281 --> 23:43.250
Can't punch it, can't
peel it, can't torch it.

23:43.252 --> 23:47.424
You're gonna have to romance
the numbers out of her.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.894
You been training new talent?

23:53.896 --> 23:55.829
Nah, not in a couple years.

23:55.831 --> 24:00.002
Something don't go boom, these
young guys don't give a shit.

24:01.503 --> 24:02.939
Speaking of which.

24:13.249 --> 24:14.418
This the 45?

24:15.484 --> 24:18.586
New lever springs, slide catch,

24:18.588 --> 24:21.122
pins, grip screws, everything.

24:22.325 --> 24:23.557
Misfired on the
last guy who had it

24:23.559 --> 24:24.558
'cause he wore it
out at the range

24:24.560 --> 24:28.061
and never bothered to
clean out the residue.

24:28.063 --> 24:30.832
What'd I always
used to tell you?

24:32.001 --> 24:33.934
Always respect the equipment.

24:33.936 --> 24:35.202
That's right.

24:35.204 --> 24:38.005
Keep her clean, she'll be fine.

24:38.007 --> 24:40.942
When's the last time
you been inside a box?

24:40.944 --> 24:42.245
Oh, shit, Jesus.

24:43.579 --> 24:44.878
Three years maybe.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.913
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:45.915 --> 24:47.615
Job down in Ojai.

24:47.617 --> 24:49.485
Brinks Quad bolt 36.

24:50.953 --> 24:54.622
Took me three hours just to
get through the hard plate.

24:54.624 --> 24:58.526
Don't have the legs for
it anymore, I suppose.

24:58.528 --> 25:00.862
What about Hairston?

25:00.864 --> 25:01.561
Retired.

25:01.563 --> 25:02.563
No shit?

25:03.899 --> 25:05.365
Up in Pollock Pines.

25:05.367 --> 25:06.933
How about Rich Noya?

25:06.935 --> 25:07.868
Oh, fuck, man.

25:07.870 --> 25:08.501
Dead.

25:08.503 --> 25:09.636
Dead.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.571
Shut the fuck up.

25:11.573 --> 25:12.606
Yeah, shit man.

25:12.608 --> 25:14.442
On the job in Wyoming.

25:14.444 --> 25:16.911
Little jewelry exchange,
Rent-a-Cop walks in on him.

25:16.913 --> 25:19.012
Empties an entire
18 round mag at him,

25:19.014 --> 25:20.448
only managed to hit him twice.

25:20.450 --> 25:21.649
Wow.

25:21.651 --> 25:24.018
Got him in the
right place, though.

25:24.020 --> 25:28.025
We're a dying breed,
Jimmy, what can I tell you?

25:31.594 --> 25:34.331
Lloyd's gonna be
looking for you.

25:35.898 --> 25:37.464
Probably, yeah.

25:37.466 --> 25:41.035
Probably gonna be asking
about his 28 grand, too.

25:41.037 --> 25:41.669
What?

25:41.671 --> 25:42.903
Nothing.

25:42.905 --> 25:44.105
Oh, come on, what?

25:44.107 --> 25:46.007
Nothing, you hear shit that
ain't worth talking about.

25:46.009 --> 25:47.340
Anyway man, you're out.

25:47.342 --> 25:48.911
Back in the saddle.

25:50.012 --> 25:51.913
Four years you were in,

25:51.915 --> 25:54.949
half a year before that
since your last punch.

25:54.951 --> 25:56.983
You think you still
got the touch?

26:00.924 --> 26:02.990
What number's that?

26:02.992 --> 26:03.992
33.

26:08.431 --> 26:10.030
Lucky guess.

26:15.104 --> 26:16.136
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:16.138 --> 26:17.473
Is this the guy?

26:18.974 --> 26:19.707
Hey!

26:19.709 --> 26:20.974
Fucking look at him!

26:20.976 --> 26:22.509
Is that the guy?

26:22.511 --> 26:23.443
No.

26:23.445 --> 26:25.680
I'm doing something, Jesus.

26:25.682 --> 26:27.013
God damn it!

26:27.015 --> 26:28.015
What the fuck?

26:28.017 --> 26:29.951
Are you fucking kidding
me with this shit?

26:29.953 --> 26:32.720
You are not here to text
your fucking dealer, alright?

26:32.722 --> 26:33.621
I swear if you cracked my screen

26:33.623 --> 26:35.655
I'm gonna make you
fucking pay for it.

26:35.657 --> 26:36.824
Shut the fuck up.

26:36.826 --> 26:39.426
It's not like that's what
I was doing anyways, okay?

26:39.428 --> 26:42.096
And Memo's not my
fucking dealer, alright?

26:42.098 --> 26:43.330
He's my pimp.

26:43.332 --> 26:45.967
Just shut the fuck up
and watch the garage.

26:45.969 --> 26:47.434
Fucking Christs' sake.

26:49.004 --> 26:50.037
Jesus.

26:50.039 --> 26:50.971
Hey, you're staring

26:50.973 --> 26:54.040
at possession with
intent here, dipshit,

26:54.042 --> 26:55.576
plus what you still
owe at Valley State.

26:55.578 --> 26:58.078
You want me to bust
your ass back up North,

26:58.080 --> 26:59.512
make some big bitch
with a buzz cut

26:59.514 --> 27:03.416
have you go down on her
every fucking night?

27:03.418 --> 27:05.185
Shut the fuck up.

27:05.187 --> 27:06.686
Big deal.

27:06.688 --> 27:09.522
That'll be like the third
pussy I've eaten this week.

27:09.524 --> 27:11.358
Jesus Christ.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.193
What kinda mother did you have?

27:13.195 --> 27:15.395
She's up at Valley State, too.

27:15.397 --> 27:16.397
Go ask her.

27:17.733 --> 27:18.968
No shit?

27:21.069 --> 27:22.336
June fucking Cleaver.

27:22.338 --> 27:23.440
Jesus Christ.

27:25.008 --> 27:27.141
Is he is fucking peeing?

27:27.143 --> 27:29.078
God, that's disgusting!

27:31.114 --> 27:31.778
Hey, whoa, whoa.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.748
Here comes another one.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.149
Is that him?

27:35.151 --> 27:35.782
No.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.218
Joey's like way taller.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.685
You better not be
jerking us around.

27:38.687 --> 27:39.854
I swear to Christ I'll
rip your fucking tits off.

27:39.856 --> 27:43.024
Hey, I heard from like two
people that score off him

27:43.026 --> 27:44.491
this is where he comes
to get Nickel Deck

27:44.493 --> 27:46.460
after he goes to the
methadone clinic.

27:46.462 --> 27:50.067
Like three or four
times a week at least.

27:53.301 --> 27:54.402
Jesus Christ, man.

27:54.404 --> 27:56.069
Are you all right?

27:56.071 --> 27:57.951
You're sweating like a
god damn whore in church.

27:58.573 --> 28:00.274
I'm fucking
pissing razor blades.

28:01.476 --> 28:03.144
I got pills for it somewhere.

28:03.146 --> 28:04.011
10-Lincoln-14
I show 10-19 on your 20,

28:04.013 --> 28:06.313

Victor, be advised.

28:06.315 --> 28:08.182
Got pills for my fucking piss,

28:08.184 --> 28:12.086
pills for my stomach,
pills for my knee.

28:12.088 --> 28:14.422
You hear that shit
with the Koreans?

28:14.424 --> 28:17.157
The ones you bet with?

28:17.159 --> 28:19.460
What is it, Wah Ching something?

28:19.462 --> 28:22.096
No that's those
Korean Pride assholes.

28:22.098 --> 28:24.265
Talkin' about MS13.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.099
They got those two clubs.

28:26.101 --> 28:28.469
One of em's over on Telegraph.

28:28.471 --> 28:30.837
Half the guys in
Central play there.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.373
You know, the one
with the security guy

28:32.375 --> 28:35.776
looks like a retarded
version of Leon Spinks?

28:35.778 --> 28:37.510
You know, that big fuckin' guy.

28:38.580 --> 28:39.512
My phone's ringing.

28:39.514 --> 28:40.713
Hey, you get outta this car

28:40.715 --> 28:41.949
I'm gonna bounce
you into jail today.

28:41.951 --> 28:46.289
Fine but if it's the clinic
I'm gonna be fucking pissed.

28:49.157 --> 28:50.391
So the redhead?

28:50.393 --> 28:53.827
The one who works
the cage, right?

28:53.829 --> 28:55.195
Then runs whores out back?

28:55.197 --> 28:56.797
Oh, yeah, I've played
there a few times.

28:56.799 --> 28:58.531
They got hit last week.

28:59.801 --> 29:02.368
Roomful of zips, bosses
from all over the state,

29:02.370 --> 29:04.440
some big fuckin' pow wow.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.607
Sons of Samoa go in
there guns blazing,

29:07.609 --> 29:09.445
cleaned the place out.

29:11.379 --> 29:12.779
Jesus.

29:12.781 --> 29:16.218
We're living in some
violent fucking times, man.

29:17.619 --> 29:18.551
Hey.

29:18.553 --> 29:19.886
Is this the guy?

29:19.888 --> 29:23.790
I'll fucking tell you
when I see him, Jesus.

29:24.828 --> 29:26.826
Korean Pride ain't
taking my sheets anymore,

29:26.828 --> 29:28.561
you believe that?

29:28.563 --> 29:31.765
Won't give me a parlay, nothing.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.299
I had one of my
CI's go in there,

29:33.301 --> 29:35.269
try to lay something
down for me,

29:35.271 --> 29:39.443
they smelled a fucking rat,
still wouldn't take it.

29:40.175 --> 29:41.278
So how deep you in?

29:42.244 --> 29:43.443
About up to here.

29:43.445 --> 29:44.678
10-Lincoln-14

29:44.680 --> 29:46.212
I still show you
10-19 on your 20,

29:46.214 --> 29:47.213

29:47.215 --> 29:49.616
- please respond.
- Yeah, 20-Lincoln-14, copy.

29:49.618 --> 29:50.618
Jesus.

29:52.421 --> 29:54.491
How deep is up to here?

29:56.826 --> 29:57.826
48,000.

30:00.796 --> 30:02.363
48,000?

30:02.365 --> 30:04.832
Jesus, for how long?

30:04.834 --> 30:06.136
Six months.

30:08.171 --> 30:09.606
Holy shit, man.

30:12.241 --> 30:14.508
They are gonna put
paper out on you, man.

30:14.510 --> 30:16.746
They ain't gonna do shit.

30:19.948 --> 30:20.914
I fucking hate this, man.

30:20.916 --> 30:22.118
I hate this.

30:23.886 --> 30:26.653
I'm a fucking babysitter.

30:26.655 --> 30:27.587
God damn, look at me.

30:27.589 --> 30:28.655
I'm a fucking babysitter.

30:28.657 --> 30:29.856
I'm babysitting

30:29.858 --> 30:33.663
a goddamn pussy eating fucking
19-year-old Cyndi Lauper.

30:37.934 --> 30:40.201
So what's that make me?

30:40.203 --> 30:41.801
Hey, I'll take
Narc over probation

30:41.803 --> 30:44.305
and parole any day
of the fucking week.

30:44.307 --> 30:46.272
You should see some
of the pieces of shit

30:46.274 --> 30:49.710
they got me swimming around
the same toilet bowl with.

30:49.712 --> 30:50.944
Can we get something to eat?

30:50.946 --> 30:54.280
I'd suck somebody's dick for
a fucking sandwich right now.

30:54.282 --> 30:57.684
Broke ass cons fresh outta stir.

30:59.722 --> 31:01.989
I shake the change outta
their pockets for what?

31:01.991 --> 31:04.895
A fuckin' grand,
maybe two a month?

31:06.963 --> 31:10.431
Narc man, that's where
the real money is.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.432
Major case, too.

31:12.434 --> 31:15.269
Do you guys always do this?

31:15.271 --> 31:16.203
What?

31:16.205 --> 31:19.306
Talk about this stuff
in front of people?

31:19.308 --> 31:21.874
You're not people
sweetheart, you're furniture.

31:21.876 --> 31:23.009
You're fucking scenery.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.711
Fuck you.

31:24.713 --> 31:28.281
You smell like the bathroom
floor of a fucking strip club.

31:28.283 --> 31:31.317
Hey, have you ever came
across this guy in Narc,

31:31.319 --> 31:32.353
Jimmy Hill?

31:32.355 --> 31:33.355
Hm.

31:34.357 --> 31:35.288
I'm gonna have to
bail on you, Vic,

31:35.290 --> 31:36.990
I got a fucking another parolee

31:36.992 --> 31:40.294
I gotta take a couple laps
around the fucking bowl with.

31:40.296 --> 31:41.296
Yeah.

31:41.830 --> 31:43.297
No problem.

31:43.299 --> 31:45.531
I'm gonna help Gidget
here with her homework.

31:45.533 --> 31:46.533
Oh shit!

31:47.636 --> 31:48.868
What?

31:48.870 --> 31:50.037
That's him!

31:58.513 --> 31:59.513
Fuck.

32:11.293 --> 32:12.859
You back to work yet?

32:12.861 --> 32:14.263
What'd you say?

32:15.330 --> 32:16.596
You know, I used to ride

32:16.598 --> 32:20.366
my first patrol in
this neighborhood.

32:20.368 --> 32:22.068
Basic patrol zone.

32:22.070 --> 32:25.506
22nd Street all the
way over to Guerrero.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.074
That place right over
there across the street

32:27.076 --> 32:28.842
used to be a little dive bar,

32:28.844 --> 32:33.016
I swear we used to have that
paddy wagon parked out in front

32:33.749 --> 32:34.918
three nights a week.

32:37.552 --> 32:39.319
You're Jimmy Hill, yeah?

32:39.321 --> 32:40.554
Who's asking?

32:41.890 --> 32:43.993
Knew I'd find you here.

32:45.461 --> 32:47.394
Most cons, first thing they
do when they taste freedom,

32:47.396 --> 32:48.628
they track down the
trim they were sniffing

32:48.630 --> 32:50.633
before they went inside.

32:53.069 --> 32:54.968
So how was it, Jimmy?

32:54.970 --> 32:59.342
A few laps on the old lady
make you feel like a new man?

33:04.012 --> 33:05.679
Jack Burbank.

33:05.681 --> 33:09.415
Bureau of Probation
and Field Services.

33:09.417 --> 33:12.452
At least that's what it
says on the card, anyway.

33:12.454 --> 33:14.555
I ain't supposed to be in
your office til tomorrow, Jack.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.522
So what do you want from me?

33:16.524 --> 33:17.691
Hey, hey, hey.

33:17.693 --> 33:20.461
You gotta relax, Jimmy,
you're a free man.

33:20.463 --> 33:21.961
You're all tensed up.

33:21.963 --> 33:26.069
You're still staring down
the brothers in C block.

33:27.536 --> 33:28.538
Your jacket.

33:29.504 --> 33:31.940
Thing's thicker than my dick.

33:33.509 --> 33:36.676
You got B&E, assault,
armed robbery,

33:36.678 --> 33:39.515
and my personal
favorite, 2911-31,

33:41.649 --> 33:45.118
unlawful entry of
a safe or vault.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.653
Ironwood, Statesville.

33:47.655 --> 33:48.855
It also says here

33:48.857 --> 33:51.090
that you're getting
your parole transferred

33:51.092 --> 33:53.396
down to San Diego County,

33:55.130 --> 33:59.133
parole Sergeant John Hagen,
effective in two weeks.

33:59.135 --> 33:59.967
Yeah?

33:59.969 --> 34:01.771
Yeah, what about it?

34:04.973 --> 34:05.972
What's that gonna cost you?

34:05.974 --> 34:08.474
What are you talking about?

34:08.476 --> 34:10.143
Your guy, Hagen.

34:10.146 --> 34:11.647
A thou, maybe two?

34:12.880 --> 34:15.149
He lets you cross the border,

34:15.150 --> 34:19.522
puts you in that log book of
his til your probation's up.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.853
Hey man, more power to ya.

34:21.856 --> 34:24.591
But this is a crazy fucking
world we live in, Jimmy.

34:24.592 --> 34:27.428
Lot of shit can happen
between now and then.

34:27.429 --> 34:29.929
You know, you still owe two
years on your last stretch.

34:29.931 --> 34:32.866
Who's to say you don't do
something fucking stupid

34:32.868 --> 34:35.502
and get your ass bounced
back up to Ironwood

34:35.504 --> 34:39.141
before you even get your
god damn bags packed?

34:41.543 --> 34:43.011
So be honest, Jimmy.

34:45.112 --> 34:48.047
When you hear those little
tumblers start to click,

34:48.050 --> 34:50.650
clutch driver wheel kicks in,

34:50.652 --> 34:54.487
rotary combination
starts spinning.

34:54.489 --> 34:57.089
Still gives you
half a chub, right?

34:57.091 --> 34:58.491
I don't know what
you heard, Jack,

34:58.493 --> 35:00.127
but I'm rehabilitated.

35:00.129 --> 35:02.595
Self help seminars, pottery
class, all that bullshit.

35:02.597 --> 35:03.529
Yeah, yeah.

35:03.531 --> 35:04.997
Save the scared straight bit

35:04.999 --> 35:08.570
for the parole board next
time you're in there.

35:10.573 --> 35:14.508
There's three things you can
count on in this life, kid.

35:14.510 --> 35:16.776
Sky's blue, sun
sets in the west,

35:16.778 --> 35:18.879
and lifers like Jimmy
Hill violate their parole.

35:18.881 --> 35:21.548
It ain't an if thing,
it's a when thing.

35:21.550 --> 35:22.515
Well, when you get to the part

35:22.517 --> 35:23.816
where I'm supposed to
start giving a fuck,

35:23.818 --> 35:25.118
why don't you give
me a call, Jack.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.019
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:26.021 --> 35:26.854
Listen.

35:26.856 --> 35:28.087
Whoa.

35:28.089 --> 35:30.557
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

35:30.559 --> 35:32.725
You're not a citizen anymore,
you're a fucking convict

35:32.727 --> 35:36.899
and a lot of shit can
happen to a fucking convict.

35:38.566 --> 35:41.535
Like your P.O. says that you
took a shot at him, alright?

35:41.537 --> 35:45.605
Somebody finds a dime
bag in your pocket.

35:45.607 --> 35:46.776
A lot of shit.

35:48.743 --> 35:51.678
So the fucking point, Jimmy,

35:51.680 --> 35:55.515
my fucking point

35:55.517 --> 35:58.017
is if you wanna Shawshank
it down to fucking Mexico,

35:58.019 --> 36:00.620
you gotta buy your way there.

36:00.622 --> 36:02.756
And so far I ain't
seen a fucking dime.

36:02.758 --> 36:03.758
How much?

36:04.727 --> 36:06.292
I'm not a greedy man.

36:06.294 --> 36:07.160
10,000.

36:07.162 --> 36:07.995
10,000?

36:07.997 --> 36:08.928
That oughta do it.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.263
- 10,000.
- 10,000 bucks?

36:10.265 --> 36:14.203
10 strong or I violate
your fucking parole.

36:16.604 --> 36:17.638
You're a smart kid.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.609
10,000 oughta be
a piece of cake.

36:30.685 --> 36:31.685
Hey, Jimmy.

36:34.656 --> 36:35.656
Yeah.

36:36.792 --> 36:37.792
Smile.

36:39.562 --> 36:42.995
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

37:18.167 --> 37:19.332
I know you're there.

37:19.334 --> 37:20.468
I can hear you breathing.

37:20.470 --> 37:24.638
Sounds like like maybe three
hours off your last fix,

37:24.640 --> 37:26.640
gettin' that tremble
in your breath.

37:26.642 --> 37:28.274
What do you want, Lloyd?

37:28.276 --> 37:30.343
That any way to talk to me?

37:30.345 --> 37:32.044
Maybe I oughta come over,

37:32.046 --> 37:36.218
talk about ways we can keep
a civil tongue in your head.

37:36.818 --> 37:37.883
I'm sorry.

37:37.885 --> 37:38.718
See?

37:38.720 --> 37:39.720
All better.

37:40.789 --> 37:42.191
I heard he's out.

37:44.359 --> 37:46.026
Yeah.

37:46.028 --> 37:48.263
He come see you?

37:49.330 --> 37:52.732
♪ Baby love riding that smack

37:52.734 --> 37:55.801
♪ Won't be long til

37:55.803 --> 37:57.037
Don't.

37:57.039 --> 37:59.105
♪ Got no place to
run no place to hide

37:59.107 --> 38:00.874

38:33.274 --> 38:35.110
We're out of yogurt.

38:46.421 --> 38:48.354
You gonna make me say it?

38:51.060 --> 38:52.060
Yeah.

38:53.761 --> 38:56.633
Yeah, I'm gonna make you say it.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.135
Fine, call Lloyd if you want to.

39:01.470 --> 39:04.037
Yeah, maybe we should.

39:04.039 --> 39:06.809
He hasn't paid
you up in a while.

39:08.209 --> 39:12.381
It's a bitch living in somebody
else's pocket, ain't it?

39:26.227 --> 39:27.359
Please.

39:30.365 --> 39:31.865
The magic word.

40:09.905 --> 40:11.937
Jimmy Hill here to see Nesto.

40:18.213 --> 40:19.879
All right, legs.

40:24.019 --> 40:25.317
Pete tells me
you did the whole school

40:25.319 --> 40:27.087
of the seven bells thing.

40:27.089 --> 40:28.321
Is that true?

40:28.323 --> 40:30.790
Yeah, back when I was a kid.

40:30.792 --> 40:32.024
God damn.

40:32.026 --> 40:35.828
I never met anybody
who actually did that.

40:35.830 --> 40:38.365
I mean I heard about it.

40:38.367 --> 40:41.937
I knew a guy who knew
a guy who knew a guy.

40:43.205 --> 40:45.872
Half figured it was,
how do you call it,

40:45.874 --> 40:48.808
an urban legend or
something like that.

40:48.810 --> 40:50.810
Instructor fits a
mannequin with a bell

40:50.812 --> 40:52.379
on all seven places on a body

40:52.381 --> 40:54.980
a pickpocket can make
a successful lift.

40:54.982 --> 40:57.883
Once you make all seven
lifts without ringing a bell,

40:57.885 --> 40:58.987
you graduate.

41:00.055 --> 41:03.089
God damn natural born criminal.

41:11.867 --> 41:14.033
Get your fucking ass up!

41:19.540 --> 41:22.408
He used to work the book
for a guy named Wells.

41:22.410 --> 41:26.145
Wells bought it, now
his ass belongs to me.

41:26.147 --> 41:30.183
Said he had a guy left him
holding the bag on 11 grand.

41:30.185 --> 41:32.185
Motherfucker hands me a book

41:32.187 --> 41:34.354
with 11 gs missing in it.

41:34.356 --> 41:36.526
Can you believe that shit?

41:38.894 --> 41:40.093
Hey!

41:41.162 --> 41:42.095
Cheer up Carnal.

41:42.097 --> 41:43.930
You still got 23 miles to go.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.100
Looks like the crew's changed.

41:48.102 --> 41:51.537
You graduated from
Mexicans to legit muscle.

41:51.539 --> 41:53.339
You been inside a long time.

41:53.341 --> 41:55.343
A lot of shit's changed.

41:56.310 --> 41:58.944
Yeah, or just the view.

41:58.946 --> 42:00.312
Cops?

42:00.314 --> 42:01.480
Pete was.

42:01.482 --> 42:02.883
LAPD.

42:02.885 --> 42:04.651
20 years, retired.

42:04.653 --> 42:05.651
Rampart.

42:05.653 --> 42:07.589
Hollenbeck before that.

42:08.957 --> 42:10.457
You ever heard of
a bait dog, Jimmy?

42:10.459 --> 42:11.892
A bait dog?

42:11.894 --> 42:13.259
Yeah.

42:13.261 --> 42:16.930
Let's say a guy was to
put two dogs into a ring,

42:16.932 --> 42:20.433
you're looking at 100,
120 people in the crowd.

42:20.435 --> 42:24.607
So before they let a new dog
in you toss in a bait dog,

42:25.941 --> 42:27.439
maybe an undersized
German Shepard,

42:27.441 --> 42:30.276
see how fast the pit
bull tears him apart.

42:30.278 --> 42:34.013
The dog's good enough,
he goes into the ring.

42:34.015 --> 42:35.982
Same thing with people, Jimmy.

42:35.984 --> 42:39.622
You gotta make sure they
still got a fastball.

42:42.290 --> 42:45.058
Solid steel door,
half inch bolt.

42:45.060 --> 42:47.294
Dual re-lock system.

42:47.296 --> 42:48.998
Nothing too fancy.

42:51.633 --> 42:52.933
You got one minute.

42:52.935 --> 42:54.303
I don't audition.

42:59.207 --> 43:01.174
Resume don't mean shit to me.

43:01.176 --> 43:02.979
Rep means even less.

43:03.678 --> 43:07.048
A guy has a skillset,
I wanna see it.

43:10.385 --> 43:12.555
You got 45 seconds, Jimmy.

43:14.722 --> 43:16.258
Give me a gun.

43:19.461 --> 43:20.897
It's all right.

43:36.711 --> 43:41.082
Wouldn't keep my valuables
in there if I was you.

43:41.749 --> 43:42.982
Electric safes have this pin

43:42.984 --> 43:45.618
that keep the bolt from sliding.

43:45.620 --> 43:47.354
Hit it hard enough, you
can make the pin drop

43:47.356 --> 43:48.287
while you slide the bolt.

43:48.289 --> 43:50.525
No counterweight to stop it.

43:56.731 --> 44:00.399
Hayman RB-3 tri-bolt double
compartment floor safe.

44:00.401 --> 44:03.035
Inch and 1/4 slide bolts,
stainless steel walls.

44:03.037 --> 44:05.571
3/4 inch door collar bolted
and welded to the body

44:05.573 --> 44:06.707
on all four sides.

44:06.709 --> 44:09.241
Three inch door, stainless
steel flat locking system.

44:09.243 --> 44:10.709
Drill resistive hardplate.

44:10.711 --> 44:15.016
Won't be able to bounce
that one open, hey, smart guy?

44:15.550 --> 44:16.616
So what's the play?

44:16.618 --> 44:20.220
You ever heard of a guy
named Rubio Rodriguez?

44:20.222 --> 44:22.022
Yeah, acorn projects right?

44:22.024 --> 44:23.589
Wannabe gunslinger.

44:23.591 --> 44:25.158
Him and a bunch
of coked up Mexicans

44:25.160 --> 44:27.560
were looking to consolidate
with the Filipino Kings

44:27.562 --> 44:29.328
to set up a local distribution

44:29.330 --> 44:32.064
for some Mexicans
out of Hermosilla.

44:32.066 --> 44:35.200
They dropped two of my guys
on a thing in Richmond.

44:35.202 --> 44:37.770
They took me off for 18 keys.

44:37.772 --> 44:40.040
And never figured that the
Surenos and the Filipinos

44:40.042 --> 44:42.142
would keep from
killing each other?

44:42.144 --> 44:44.444
As long as Rubio
has his 18 keys,

44:44.446 --> 44:46.578
he didn't give a fuck.

44:46.580 --> 44:48.048
He should have, though.

44:48.050 --> 44:49.816
The Surenos whacked him.

44:49.818 --> 44:51.283
Filipinos, too.

44:51.285 --> 44:53.185
Way we hear it he's
sitting on our 18 keys

44:53.187 --> 44:55.087
plus maybe another six.

44:55.089 --> 44:56.221
The guy that has it
now used to be middle

44:56.223 --> 44:58.124
between Rubio and the Mexicans.

44:58.126 --> 45:01.394
What we hear, it's
back in the street.

45:01.396 --> 45:03.196
He keeps it in one
of these Haymans.

45:03.198 --> 45:04.798
Sunk it into the foundation,

45:04.800 --> 45:07.232
threaded rebar 10 feet
in every direction.

45:07.234 --> 45:11.406
You want the safe, you gotta
take the floor with it.

45:15.377 --> 45:18.047
This is where you're gonna go.

45:21.450 --> 45:24.787
And this is who you're
gonna find there.

45:30.691 --> 45:32.127
Does he know?

45:33.260 --> 45:35.127
Let me get this straight.

45:35.129 --> 45:36.361
You're looking to put me

45:36.363 --> 45:39.467
between you and the
fucking Mexican Mafia?

45:52.113 --> 45:53.712
You see that?

45:53.714 --> 45:54.848
A couple years back

45:54.850 --> 45:56.783
the Mexicans decided to
start taxing all the locals

45:56.785 --> 45:59.852
for all the drug sales
they made up here.

45:59.854 --> 46:04.156
Anybody who didn't wanna pay
ended up getting green lit.

46:04.158 --> 46:06.758
I've been tax free for
three years, Jimmy.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.495
Ain't nobody got me yet.

46:09.497 --> 46:11.296
I been shot twice

46:11.298 --> 46:15.070
and I took a six inch
blade between my ribs

46:17.539 --> 46:19.107
and I'm still here.

46:20.441 --> 46:22.610
I ain't asking you, Jimmy.

46:24.646 --> 46:26.645
He got people?

46:26.647 --> 46:29.318
Nobody that'll come after you.

46:33.888 --> 46:36.189
You walking out
of the joint alive

46:36.191 --> 46:38.593
was us paying you in advance.

46:39.794 --> 46:42.162
We already held up our end.

46:42.164 --> 46:43.897
So if we say this is the way
this thing's gonna shake out,

46:43.899 --> 46:45.698
guess what?

46:45.700 --> 46:46.765
You don't like that,

46:46.767 --> 46:50.502
we got a car outside with
shovels in the trunk.

46:50.504 --> 46:53.675
Plus maybe we'll
find your girlfriend,

46:54.843 --> 46:58.247
see if we can't make
us a love connection.

47:02.249 --> 47:03.852
Tomorrow night, Jimmy.

47:14.662 --> 47:16.962
You know why I'm here?

47:16.964 --> 47:18.830
Yeah.

47:18.832 --> 47:21.234
I wanna hear you say it.

47:21.236 --> 47:23.303
Alonzo, right?

47:23.305 --> 47:24.504
He sent you?

47:24.506 --> 47:26.205
Man don't like
people going around

47:26.207 --> 47:29.408
pulling dipshit fucking
stickups using his hardware.

47:29.410 --> 47:30.709
Where is it?

47:30.711 --> 47:33.212
Under the sink.

47:33.214 --> 47:34.546
That's it?

47:34.548 --> 47:35.480
Yeah.

47:35.482 --> 47:36.582
The Sig and the two .38's.

47:36.584 --> 47:38.317
That's it.

47:38.319 --> 47:39.685
Fuckin' amateur hour.

47:39.687 --> 47:40.687
Jesus!

47:47.995 --> 47:48.928
Yeah?

47:48.930 --> 47:50.263
You still up North?

47:50.265 --> 47:51.964
Yeah, I'm just finishing up.

47:51.966 --> 47:54.299
Got another one
just came in if you want it.

47:54.301 --> 47:55.535
There paper on him?

47:55.537 --> 47:56.669
Contract just went out.

47:56.671 --> 47:57.937
12,000.

47:57.939 --> 47:58.837
Who'd he piss off?

47:58.839 --> 48:00.973
They're gonna stay anonymous.

48:00.975 --> 48:02.441
Bullshit.

48:02.443 --> 48:04.810
I ain't doing it like
I did in Denver again.

48:04.812 --> 48:07.446
I do my end, then the client
pulls some home invasion

48:07.448 --> 48:10.316
or some shit trying to rake
up the fees last minute.

48:10.318 --> 48:11.350
No.

48:11.352 --> 48:12.218
These guys are straight.

48:12.220 --> 48:14.287
Full courtesy out
West, whole deal.

48:14.289 --> 48:16.622
They don't wanna push a
button, they don't gotta ask.

48:16.624 --> 48:17.557
Do you want it?

48:17.559 --> 48:19.258
I'll send you the particulars.

48:19.260 --> 48:21.361
You finish up, get
yourself to Koreatown.

48:21.363 --> 48:22.395
They'll get you square.

48:22.397 --> 48:23.763
I'll shoot you the address.

48:23.765 --> 48:24.765
Cool.

48:29.303 --> 48:30.638
Now where was I?

48:37.044 --> 48:38.278
I have a material witness

48:38.280 --> 48:42.718
on an aggravated battery with
a handgun

48:44.318 --> 48:45.817
Okay, Joseph Mandell.

48:45.819 --> 48:48.520
Probation and Parole 6227.

48:48.522 --> 48:52.694
So you got him out on 11351
with intent to distribute.

48:53.428 --> 48:54.560
You brought him in?

48:54.562 --> 48:56.529
Got him in interview two, yeah.

48:56.531 --> 48:58.064
Intent to distribute, really?

48:58.066 --> 48:59.765
He was carrying three ounces.

48:59.767 --> 49:02.602
He sets up outta that
place four days a week.

49:02.604 --> 49:05.404
He ain't selling Thin Mints.

49:05.406 --> 49:06.439
He one of yours?

49:06.441 --> 49:07.707
He is now.

49:07.709 --> 49:09.341
What the hell are you
doing in Narc anyway?

49:09.343 --> 49:10.375
I thought you worked Vice.

49:10.377 --> 49:11.910
Some bullshit.

49:11.912 --> 49:16.015
They got me on partial
administrative leave.

49:16.017 --> 49:20.388
Got me rotating divisions
hoping I'm putting my papers in.

49:21.323 --> 49:22.622
Had me out on loan last
month to auto theft

49:22.624 --> 49:25.625
chasing fucking bait
cars in North Beach.

49:25.627 --> 49:28.297
Hey, I need you to sign these.

49:29.430 --> 49:31.464
You cataloged all his property?

49:31.466 --> 49:32.765
What, cell phone, keys,

49:32.767 --> 49:35.401
no wallet, cash, anything?

49:35.403 --> 49:36.535
Hey, I gotta ask.

49:36.537 --> 49:37.970
These assholes get kicked,

49:37.972 --> 49:40.372
they claim half their
shit's missing, it's my ass.

49:40.374 --> 49:42.941
I'm the one who's gotta
voucher all this stuff.

49:42.943 --> 49:46.044
Anyway, I know you got debts.

49:46.046 --> 49:50.351
Yeah, turns out being
an alcoholic's expensive.

49:52.720 --> 49:54.889
No money, no wallet, okay?

49:57.392 --> 49:59.459
Jesus, Vic, don't get all pissy.

50:00.995 --> 50:02.761
They say I gotta ask, so I ask.

50:06.100 --> 50:07.500
Okay.

50:28.923 --> 50:31.026
Schedule two narcotics.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.329
Three ounces.

50:35.530 --> 50:37.029
Paraphernalia.

50:37.031 --> 50:38.031
Needles.

50:43.470 --> 50:46.805
That's felony possession sittin'
right there on the table.

50:46.807 --> 50:49.741
State of California
that's three years.

50:49.743 --> 50:51.910
Plus you still owe
two up in Susanville,

50:51.912 --> 50:54.080
that's gonna bump you
up to at least five,

50:54.082 --> 50:56.649
plus whatever they
tack on for the intent.

50:56.651 --> 50:58.651
Three ounces?

50:58.653 --> 50:59.484
Come on, man.

50:59.486 --> 51:00.520
Five years?

51:00.522 --> 51:01.520
I can't do five years.

51:01.522 --> 51:03.423
And what's this intent shit?

51:03.425 --> 51:05.124
The only intent I had
was to smoke that shit

51:05.126 --> 51:06.125
and watch Game of Thrones.

51:06.127 --> 51:07.894
The people that make
the laws in this state

51:07.896 --> 51:10.495
don't like piece of shit
methadone clinic dropouts

51:10.497 --> 51:12.432
selling this crap
to their kids, Joey.

51:12.434 --> 51:13.698
What can I say?

51:13.700 --> 51:15.133
I can't go back up
to Susanville, man.

51:15.135 --> 51:16.468
Please, come on, we
gotta work something out!

51:16.470 --> 51:17.870
Outta my hands, Joey.

51:17.872 --> 51:19.071
Look.

51:19.073 --> 51:21.107
I got a van full of
merch up in the Castro.

51:21.109 --> 51:23.475
I got iPads, I got plasma TV's,

51:23.477 --> 51:25.111
I got food processors and
shit, anything you want.

51:25.113 --> 51:26.546
Possession of stolen property,

51:26.548 --> 51:28.214
that'll get you another year.

51:28.216 --> 51:29.082
What?

51:29.084 --> 51:30.850
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

51:30.852 --> 51:32.919
I meant I know a guy
with a van full of merch,

51:32.921 --> 51:34.720
I didn't mean me.

51:34.722 --> 51:35.854
Why are you writing?

51:35.856 --> 51:36.888
Stop writing.

51:36.890 --> 51:38.223
- Fraud.
- Come on.

51:38.225 --> 51:39.191
- Why are you still writing?
- Wire fraud.

51:39.193 --> 51:40.125
- Three counts robbery.
- Isn't there some kinda

51:40.127 --> 51:41.227
legal whatever

51:41.229 --> 51:42.495
- about me incriminating
- Possession

51:42.497 --> 51:42.828
- myself?
- Of stolen property.

51:42.830 --> 51:43.495
Forgery.

51:43.497 --> 51:44.796
Petty theft.

51:44.798 --> 51:46.031
That one's my favorite.

51:46.033 --> 51:46.999
No, no.

51:47.001 --> 51:48.000
That was a misunderstanding.

51:48.002 --> 51:51.803
Stealing jewelry off
a corpse at a funeral?

51:51.805 --> 51:53.104
I found that shit.

51:53.106 --> 51:54.674
Are you shittin' me, Joey?

51:54.676 --> 51:55.741
I found that shit!

51:55.743 --> 51:56.908
It was at a taco place

51:56.910 --> 51:58.176
- in El Cerrito.
- You are officially...

51:58.178 --> 51:59.111
- It was Los Tacos or...
- at the bottom rung.

51:59.113 --> 52:00.212
Or Los Tacos.

52:00.214 --> 52:01.580
Los Tacos.

52:01.582 --> 52:03.482
It was in a bag by the dumpster.

52:03.484 --> 52:05.551
Parole Supervisor Fowler.

52:05.553 --> 52:08.587
She is here to take
you back to Central.

52:08.589 --> 52:09.888
She will get you processed.

52:09.890 --> 52:11.723
You'll be in front
of a judge by six.

52:11.725 --> 52:13.526
He'll violate your parole,

52:13.528 --> 52:16.562
you'll be back in Susanville
in time for American Idol.

52:16.564 --> 52:17.562
Look at that face.

52:17.564 --> 52:19.031
They are gonna love him upstate.

52:19.033 --> 52:20.165
You're gonna be more popular

52:20.167 --> 52:22.234
than Salisbury steak Wednesdays.

52:22.236 --> 52:23.935
You're gonna be
pulling so many trains

52:23.937 --> 52:24.937
they're gonna be calling you

52:24.939 --> 52:27.205
the little engine that could.

52:27.207 --> 52:29.841
Fuck sake, Joey, we
caught you walking around

52:29.843 --> 52:31.776
with three ounces
in your pocket!

52:31.778 --> 52:34.080
We walk up, you fucking
offered to sell it to us.

52:34.082 --> 52:35.214
We got you, man.

52:35.216 --> 52:36.082
You are caught.

52:36.084 --> 52:37.250
How about seafood?

52:37.252 --> 52:38.618
- I think I can.
- Seafood.

52:38.620 --> 52:39.752
- I think I can.
- Seafood, seriously.

52:39.754 --> 52:40.620
- Everyone loves seafood.
- I think I can.

52:40.622 --> 52:41.553
I think I can.

52:41.555 --> 52:42.689
Okay, I can get you lobster.

52:42.691 --> 52:44.557
I can get you some big ass
Dungeness crabs and shit.

52:44.559 --> 52:47.093
How old are you, Joey?

52:47.095 --> 52:47.926
I'm 19.

52:47.928 --> 52:49.562
I'm 18.

52:49.564 --> 52:50.564
19, 19.

52:51.265 --> 52:52.832
A little advice, kid.

52:52.834 --> 52:54.133
Get a day job.

52:54.135 --> 52:56.602
Crime, it ain't your thing.

52:56.604 --> 52:57.638
Look.

52:59.073 --> 53:00.772
If I got something,

53:00.774 --> 53:02.908
like for real something,
like legit intel,

53:02.910 --> 53:03.843
you think you can get

53:03.845 --> 53:05.044
- me to walk?
- Intel?

53:05.046 --> 53:06.946
Jesus Christ, Joey,
turn off the fucking TV.

53:06.948 --> 53:07.879
I'm serious.

53:07.881 --> 53:09.682
Like for real shit, okay?

53:09.684 --> 53:12.285
You think you could get
me a walk on the drugs?

53:12.287 --> 53:13.953
Depends on what you got.

53:13.955 --> 53:15.321
Okay.

53:15.323 --> 53:17.557
Okay, so, there's
this guy right?

53:17.559 --> 53:18.290
Oh, get him outta here.

53:18.292 --> 53:19.625
No, no, no, no, no, no.

53:19.627 --> 53:20.892
Draymond, Draymond, Draymond!

53:20.894 --> 53:21.727
Stevens!

53:21.729 --> 53:23.229
Draymond Stevens.

53:23.231 --> 53:25.230
He used to chop cars with
his crew back in the day

53:25.232 --> 53:27.232
who was in tight with this,

53:27.234 --> 53:30.169
his name was Nesto, Nesto...

53:30.171 --> 53:31.069
Diaz?

53:31.071 --> 53:32.071
Nesto Diaz.

53:32.073 --> 53:33.305
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:33.307 --> 53:34.339
You heard of him?

53:34.341 --> 53:36.042
Yeah.

53:36.044 --> 53:37.343
As indicated by my saying
his last name, dipshit.

53:37.345 --> 53:38.578
Keep going.

53:38.580 --> 53:39.979
Right, sorry, anyway.

53:39.981 --> 53:42.247
I seen Draymond,
it must have been

53:42.249 --> 53:44.883
like three hours before
you guys picked me up

53:44.885 --> 53:47.687
and he's going on and on about
how he's looking for work

53:47.689 --> 53:48.888
and he might have something soon

53:48.890 --> 53:50.589
off Nesto using
this guy Jimmy Hill

53:50.591 --> 53:53.258
to get into a safe or something.

53:53.260 --> 53:54.192
Right?

53:54.194 --> 53:55.595
Like it's a bunch of money or

53:55.597 --> 53:56.194
- dope or something.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

53:56.196 --> 53:57.629
Back up, back up.

53:57.631 --> 53:58.863
Who's that, what's
that name again?

53:58.865 --> 53:59.865
Who?

53:59.867 --> 54:00.832
The guy.

54:00.834 --> 54:02.667
The one that Nesto's using.

54:02.669 --> 54:04.303
Jimmy Hill?

54:04.305 --> 54:06.308
Yeah, I think that's it.

54:10.711 --> 54:11.711
Take a walk.

54:18.885 --> 54:20.218
Are you sure about this?

54:20.220 --> 54:21.654
You're not jerking me around?

54:21.656 --> 54:22.656
Swear, yeah.

54:26.794 --> 54:27.794
Come on.

54:31.633 --> 54:32.665
Come on.

54:32.667 --> 54:34.603
We're going for a ride.

54:42.644 --> 54:44.042
Oh, Jesus,

54:44.044 --> 54:44.877
you're not gonna do anything
weird to me are you?

54:44.879 --> 54:46.178
Oh, shut the fuck up.

54:46.180 --> 54:47.680
What are you doing?

54:47.682 --> 54:48.413
Shut the fuck up.

54:48.415 --> 54:49.415
What are you doing?

54:50.051 --> 54:51.049
Nah, man, I'm not into.

54:51.051 --> 54:52.183
- I'm not into it!
- Wait in here!

54:52.185 --> 54:53.019
What are you doing?

54:53.021 --> 54:53.852
- No!
- Get over here!

54:53.854 --> 54:54.854
No!

55:00.794 --> 55:01.993
What's this?

55:01.995 --> 55:03.261
Yeah you're right,

55:03.263 --> 55:05.865
why don't I just let you
sit here while I'm gone.

55:05.867 --> 55:06.899
I'll leave the window down.

55:06.901 --> 55:07.832
Want me to leave you the keys

55:07.834 --> 55:09.769
so you can listen to the radio?

55:09.771 --> 55:13.175
Just sit there and be
quiet til I get back.

55:14.242 --> 55:15.408
Hey, come on, man!

55:15.410 --> 55:17.279
I gotta take a piss!

56:00.722 --> 56:02.354
I like that song.

56:02.356 --> 56:03.792
Kinda funereal.

56:04.459 --> 56:06.694
Kinda makes you think.

56:09.796 --> 56:11.332
Put the phone down.

56:14.301 --> 56:16.102
Put your hands up.

56:16.104 --> 56:18.470
Take two steps from the counter.

56:18.472 --> 56:20.875
Come out where I can see you.

56:25.513 --> 56:26.845
Open your coat.

56:26.847 --> 56:27.979
Both sides.

56:27.981 --> 56:29.383
Then turn around.

56:32.919 --> 56:34.819
Toss it over there.

56:34.821 --> 56:35.821
Nice and easy.

56:40.794 --> 56:42.798
Lift your pants legs up.

56:48.435 --> 56:50.372
Come over and sit down.

57:01.381 --> 57:02.848
Go on.

57:02.850 --> 57:06.388
Ain't like me to stop a
man from having a drink.

57:13.794 --> 57:15.794
You left those boys
over in Koreatown

57:15.796 --> 57:18.867
hanging for 55 grand
for half a year.

57:19.934 --> 57:23.134
They don't give a shit
about you being a cop.

57:23.136 --> 57:25.307
They put paper out on you.

57:26.573 --> 57:27.740
Who are you?

57:27.742 --> 57:30.942
List of shit you should be
concerned about right now,

57:30.944 --> 57:32.914
that's at the bottom.

57:33.548 --> 57:34.413
I'm a cop.

57:34.415 --> 57:38.450
I told you, they
don't give a shit.

57:38.452 --> 57:40.252
I can help you.

57:40.254 --> 57:43.091
I look like I need help?

57:44.124 --> 57:45.558
That's not what I mean.

57:45.560 --> 57:47.129
Can't trust cops.

57:48.196 --> 57:49.895
Guys who do what I do,

57:49.897 --> 57:52.330
you know where the fuck I stand.

57:52.332 --> 57:54.502
There's integrity to that.

57:55.336 --> 57:56.336
Cops man.

57:57.305 --> 58:00.372
You guys operate
on a sliding scale.

58:00.374 --> 58:03.912
I can't predict that
i.e. I can't trust it.

58:06.314 --> 58:08.980
You can't just kill a cop.

58:08.982 --> 58:10.549
That's a world of shit, pal.

58:10.551 --> 58:11.883
Maybe you ain't thought of that.

58:11.885 --> 58:14.855
We're talking consequences now?

58:16.156 --> 58:17.288
Maybe.

58:18.426 --> 58:19.426
You guys.

58:21.028 --> 58:24.330
You think you're
so bullet proof.

58:24.332 --> 58:27.899
There's cops and then
everybody else, right?

58:27.901 --> 58:29.436
Nobody can touch you.

58:30.872 --> 58:33.906
Motherfucker, you are
looking consequences

58:33.908 --> 58:35.410
right in the eyes.

58:38.446 --> 58:39.944
Go on.

58:39.946 --> 58:41.448
Finish your drink.

58:42.316 --> 58:45.017
Then I get to go to work.

59:08.175 --> 59:09.510
What the fuck?

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.787
Hey, yeah, yeah.

01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:03.522
Is this Jack Burbank?

01:01:03.524 --> 01:01:04.723
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:04.725 --> 01:01:06.091
This is the guy
you arrested today.

01:01:06.093 --> 01:01:08.326
The shop in the
Mission, remember?

01:01:08.328 --> 01:01:10.462
Yeah, look, it doesn't
matter how I got it, okay?

01:01:10.464 --> 01:01:12.634
I got information for you.

01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:22.542
Yeah.

01:01:24.577 --> 01:01:27.078
Yeah and I wanna
get paid for it.

01:01:29.783 --> 01:01:31.582
Hey, Don, it's Jimmy Hill.

01:01:31.584 --> 01:01:32.584
Hey, Jimmy.

01:01:32.586 --> 01:01:33.519
You sound like a
free man, amigo,

01:01:33.521 --> 01:01:34.685
I don't hear none of those hacks

01:01:34.687 --> 01:01:36.421
breathing on the
other end of the line.

01:01:36.423 --> 01:01:37.423
When did you get out?

01:01:37.425 --> 01:01:38.723
Yesterday.

01:01:38.725 --> 01:01:39.591
Hey, so what's the plan,

01:01:39.593 --> 01:01:41.225
you gonna make it
down here or what?

01:01:41.227 --> 01:01:42.761
Got a sweet little
deal down here.

01:01:42.763 --> 01:01:45.096
200 bucks a spin, a little
something for you on the side.

01:01:45.098 --> 01:01:46.330
It's decent money.

01:01:46.332 --> 01:01:47.799
Yeah, I'm leaving
in the morning.

01:01:47.801 --> 01:01:49.700
Just got a couple of things
I gotta take care of.

01:01:49.702 --> 01:01:51.470
Plus my P.O.'s lookin'
to put the bite on me.

01:01:51.472 --> 01:01:52.437
Jesus.

01:01:52.439 --> 01:01:53.705
Hey, listen Don, I gotta go.

01:01:53.707 --> 01:01:55.307
I'll see you when I get
down there, all right?

01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:56.341
Yeah, man, cool.

01:01:56.343 --> 01:01:57.609
See ya when I see ya.

01:01:57.611 --> 01:01:58.611
All right.

01:02:12.827 --> 01:02:13.827
Hey.

01:02:14.562 --> 01:02:15.526
Get your things ready.

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:18.165
We're leaving in the morning.

01:02:21.535 --> 01:02:22.535
Yeah.

01:02:23.771 --> 01:02:24.771
Goodbye.

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:56.868
This is the place, right?

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.171
You're sure of it?

01:02:59.173 --> 01:03:00.538
Yeah.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.607
This is it.

01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:02.674
See?

01:03:02.676 --> 01:03:03.741
Mission Liquors.

01:03:03.743 --> 01:03:05.146
19th and Sanchez.

01:03:08.149 --> 01:03:10.348
How the fuck do you
get 19th and Sanchez?

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:12.250
Who the fuck wrote this?

01:03:12.252 --> 01:03:14.252
My cousin.

01:03:14.254 --> 01:03:17.256
The one up from
Lynwood, you know.

01:03:17.258 --> 01:03:18.423
Said he's been keeping
an eye on this place

01:03:18.425 --> 01:03:20.424
for like two weeks.

01:03:20.426 --> 01:03:22.928
There's like two other
Mission Liquors around here.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:25.196
I just wanna be sure.

01:03:25.198 --> 01:03:27.899
Nah, man, this is the one.

01:03:27.901 --> 01:03:31.236
See they got that check
cashing sign out front.

01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:32.604
Thursday's when most
places around here

01:03:32.606 --> 01:03:34.238
handing out paychecks.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.209
My cousin says they get
like 100 people a day

01:03:37.211 --> 01:03:39.511
looking to come and cash out.

01:03:39.513 --> 01:03:40.946
Figure they gotta have
a lot of cash on hand

01:03:40.948 --> 01:03:42.580
to cover everybody.

01:03:42.582 --> 01:03:45.183
Yeah, well if it's
so fucking great

01:03:45.185 --> 01:03:47.785
why ain't he the
one sitting here?

01:03:47.787 --> 01:03:50.189
He's trying to find Jesus.

01:03:50.191 --> 01:03:51.557
Says there's not enough
room in his heart

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:54.562
for Jesus and a
liquor store holdup.

01:03:57.597 --> 01:03:58.529
Hey.

01:03:58.531 --> 01:03:59.497
Did you see the under card fight

01:03:59.499 --> 01:04:00.933
at the Cow Palace last night?

01:04:00.935 --> 01:04:03.301
Fucking Klay Comden.

01:04:03.303 --> 01:04:04.236
No shit.

01:04:04.238 --> 01:04:06.205
Must've put on like 70 pounds.

01:04:06.207 --> 01:04:07.471
And just stands there,

01:04:07.473 --> 01:04:08.740
lets some wannabe
light heavyweight

01:04:08.742 --> 01:04:11.243
try to chop his ass
down for 10 rounds,

01:04:11.245 --> 01:04:13.946
collects his check,
and goes on home.

01:04:13.948 --> 01:04:16.314
I had him after the Ruiz fight.

01:04:16.316 --> 01:04:17.818
Like 2010 I think?

01:04:19.986 --> 01:04:22.254
Remember that
crazy little spick?

01:04:22.256 --> 01:04:25.290
Tried to work everybody inside,
never kept his gloves up?

01:04:25.292 --> 01:04:26.225
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:26.227 --> 01:04:28.926
Third round I caught
him with a right.

01:04:28.928 --> 01:04:30.562
His fuckin' left eye
rolled straight up

01:04:30.564 --> 01:04:31.763
into the back of his head.

01:04:31.765 --> 01:04:32.964
Fuck.

01:04:32.966 --> 01:04:34.933
Other one stayed
staring right at me.

01:04:34.935 --> 01:04:36.968
Never seen anything like it.

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:39.738
Still had a minute
20 left in the round,

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.640
he couldn't see my right.

01:04:41.642 --> 01:04:44.642
I practically mashed that
eye into ground up meat.

01:04:44.644 --> 01:04:46.278
Fuck.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.247
Couldn't use it no more.

01:04:57.992 --> 01:04:59.024
Jack Burbank.

01:04:59.026 --> 01:04:59.991
What's up?

01:04:59.993 --> 01:05:00.892
Yo, Lloyd.

01:05:00.894 --> 01:05:02.493
Hey, listen, you're
never gonna guess

01:05:02.495 --> 01:05:03.995
whose jacket I just
got assigned to me.

01:05:03.997 --> 01:05:06.330
No, no, I'll give you a hint.

01:05:06.332 --> 01:05:07.765
Last time you saw him

01:05:07.767 --> 01:05:09.500
you wanted to put a bullet
in his fucking head.

01:05:09.502 --> 01:05:10.636
Andre Starks?

01:05:10.638 --> 01:05:11.837
No.

01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:13.372
Ricky Parsons?

01:05:13.374 --> 01:05:14.939
No.

01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:17.843
Oh wait I know,
must be that little

01:05:17.845 --> 01:05:20.279
Oakdale Mob motherfucker,

01:05:20.281 --> 01:05:21.683
Rodney Jefferson.

01:05:22.582 --> 01:05:24.049
No.

01:05:24.051 --> 01:05:25.716
Jesus Christ Lloyd, how the
fuck many people have you tried

01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:27.019
to kill lately?

01:05:27.021 --> 01:05:30.656
No, man, I'm talking
about Jimmy Hill.

01:05:35.428 --> 01:05:36.794
No shit.

01:05:36.796 --> 01:05:39.367
Yeah, just got kicked.

01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:44.303
I want to make sure
you stay away from him.

01:05:44.305 --> 01:05:47.506
Then what the hell did you
call and tell me he's out for?

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:49.374
God damn, Jack, you just
can't dangle a steak

01:05:49.376 --> 01:05:51.542
in front of a man and tell
him he can't have a bite.

01:05:51.544 --> 01:05:53.345
Because I'm
running the drag on him

01:05:53.347 --> 01:05:55.314
and I didn't want you
to hear it on the street

01:05:55.316 --> 01:05:57.885
and wind up fucking up my play.

01:05:59.319 --> 01:06:01.019
You got a problem with that,
your ass will be back in Chino

01:06:01.021 --> 01:06:03.555
watching the Muslims and the
Aryans shoot hoops in the yard

01:06:03.557 --> 01:06:07.261
so fast it'll make
your fucking head spin.

01:06:08.995 --> 01:06:10.662
You hearing me, Lloyd?

01:06:10.664 --> 01:06:13.397
Or did all those shots you
take to the head over the years

01:06:13.399 --> 01:06:15.302
make you deaf and stupid?

01:06:19.073 --> 01:06:20.841
Yeah, I hear you.

01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:23.575
Good.

01:06:23.577 --> 01:06:26.511
When I'm done with
him he's all yours.

01:06:26.513 --> 01:06:29.384
Til then you stay the fuck away.

01:06:34.787 --> 01:06:35.787
Yeah, Jack.

01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:37.425
Whatever you say.

01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:44.530
You okay?

01:06:45.598 --> 01:06:46.598
Yeah.

01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:51.738
Yeah, lets do this.

01:07:04.984 --> 01:07:06.618
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.687
What the fuck are you doing?

01:07:08.689 --> 01:07:09.955
What?

01:07:09.957 --> 01:07:11.689
You're gonna
pull a fucking robbery

01:07:11.691 --> 01:07:14.625
wearing a jersey with
your name on the back?

01:07:14.627 --> 01:07:18.066
- Aw, fuck, my bad.
- Take that shit off!

01:10:46.906 --> 01:10:48.842
You gonna invite me in?

01:10:50.677 --> 01:10:52.813
Fine, I'll invite myself in.

01:10:57.083 --> 01:10:58.852
Called you yesterday.

01:10:59.852 --> 01:11:01.622
Heard nothin' back.

01:11:02.722 --> 01:11:03.890
Today neither.

01:11:07.394 --> 01:11:08.893
I had to work.

01:11:08.895 --> 01:11:11.261
Funny, I went there.

01:11:11.263 --> 01:11:12.997
Said they hadn't seen you.

01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:15.233

♪ I can't be held responsible

01:11:20.239 --> 01:11:22.773

that a man chooses to get punched
in the face for a living,

01:11:28.047 --> 01:11:30.749
it's because someplace
deep down inside

01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:32.753
he feels he deserves it.

01:11:34.354 --> 01:11:37.154
You ever get hit
like that, Louly?

01:11:37.156 --> 01:11:40.994
So hard it's like getting
struck by lightning?

01:11:42.262 --> 01:11:43.262
Bam!

01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:49.401
Couple seconds there you
don't know which way's up.

01:11:49.403 --> 01:11:52.239
You're wasting your time, Lloyd.

01:11:53.739 --> 01:11:56.843
Somebody's been
eating my porridge.

01:11:59.913 --> 01:12:02.813
Somebody's been
sleeping in my bed, too?

01:12:02.815 --> 01:12:04.448
It's not your bed.

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.452
You got that down
cold, don't you?

01:12:07.454 --> 01:12:09.690
That I'm cool as shit vibe.

01:12:10.856 --> 01:12:13.724
I bet if I checked
your pulse right now

01:12:13.726 --> 01:12:15.460
that little heart of yours

01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:18.899
would be doing back
flips, wouldn't it?

01:12:21.735 --> 01:12:24.035
Worst part isn't it?

01:12:24.037 --> 01:12:25.205
The wondering.

01:12:26.306 --> 01:12:28.173
What's he gonna do?

01:12:28.175 --> 01:12:30.410
What's he gonna make me do?

01:12:31.778 --> 01:12:33.277
All kinds of shit

01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:36.747
racing through that pretty
little brain, ain't it?

01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:37.982
What do you want?

01:12:37.984 --> 01:12:41.018
Me and Jimmy got
unfinished business.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.487
That jewelry store.

01:12:42.489 --> 01:12:43.691
My 28 grand.

01:12:45.092 --> 01:12:45.990
He got arrested.

01:12:45.992 --> 01:12:48.292
There wasn't any money.

01:12:48.294 --> 01:12:49.896
Ain't my problem.

01:12:51.097 --> 01:12:52.098
Job was 100.

01:12:53.467 --> 01:12:54.835
My end was 28.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:08.049
Does he know?

01:13:12.953 --> 01:13:15.018
I asked you a question.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.756
I seen that look in your
eye as soon as I came in.

01:13:18.758 --> 01:13:21.095
Knew it the second I saw it.

01:13:22.162 --> 01:13:23.162
Hope.

01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:25.365
It doesn't exist.

01:13:26.766 --> 01:13:30.234
It's a figment of
your imagination.

01:13:30.236 --> 01:13:33.203
Your ass belongs to
me, you got that?

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:35.540
You know what you
know cause I say so.

01:13:35.542 --> 01:13:39.410
I tell you the sky's
green, the sky's green.

01:13:39.412 --> 01:13:43.249
I say take off those
panties and get into bed.

01:13:45.217 --> 01:13:46.217
Guess what?

01:13:50.923 --> 01:13:53.992
You still think he's gonna
want you when he finds out?

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:54.994
Fuck you!

01:13:58.198 --> 01:14:01.198
I don't know where he is, okay?

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.802
He wouldn't tell me.

01:14:07.274 --> 01:14:08.505
Well.

01:14:08.507 --> 01:14:10.974
Guess that's it then.

01:14:10.976 --> 01:14:13.847
Suppose I should probably leave.

01:14:24.156 --> 01:14:24.988
Hey.

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:26.925
She's holding out on us.

01:14:26.927 --> 01:14:29.527
Beat it out of her, fuck it out
of her, I don't give a shit.

01:14:29.529 --> 01:14:31.161
Just find out what she knows.

01:14:31.163 --> 01:14:33.266
You got it, man.

01:14:34.534 --> 01:14:38.372
♪ I can't be held responsible

01:15:26.953 --> 01:15:28.018
You Louly Stock?

01:15:29.623 --> 01:15:31.225
What do you want?

01:15:33.325 --> 01:15:34.325
You okay?

01:15:45.939 --> 01:15:46.970
Jesus!

01:15:51.477 --> 01:15:52.846
There we go.

01:15:54.013 --> 01:15:57.016
Lloyd Raines was up
here before, yeah?

01:15:57.684 --> 01:15:59.520
He say what he wanted?

01:16:00.654 --> 01:16:03.220
He wanted to know
where Jimmy is.

01:16:03.222 --> 01:16:04.324
He say why?

01:16:05.357 --> 01:16:06.189
No.

01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:07.024
What's going on?

01:16:07.026 --> 01:16:08.259
Why are you even...

01:16:08.261 --> 01:16:10.627
My name's Jack
Burbank, I'm SFPD.

01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:12.399
Probation and parole.

01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:14.934
Burbank.

01:16:16.002 --> 01:16:17.605
You're Jimmy's P.O.

01:16:20.306 --> 01:16:22.005
Where the fuck is he, Louly?

01:16:22.007 --> 01:16:23.675
He could be in a lot of trouble.

01:16:23.677 --> 01:16:25.576
What do you care?

01:16:25.578 --> 01:16:26.710
It's my job.

01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:28.478
Oh, it's your job?

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.015
Does that include shaking
him down for $10,000?

01:16:32.017 --> 01:16:33.684
What, you wanna make
your way down to Mexico,

01:16:33.686 --> 01:16:35.118
you've gotta buy your way down,

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.153
isn't that what you told him?

01:16:36.155 --> 01:16:38.156
All you assholes are the same.

01:16:38.158 --> 01:16:39.691
Where the fuck is he?

01:16:39.693 --> 01:16:41.028
Fuck you!

01:16:43.262 --> 01:16:45.966
Does Jimmy know about Lloyd?

01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:49.968
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:50.801
For Christ's sake.

01:16:50.803 --> 01:16:53.507
Lloyd's Lloyd,
you're what you are,

01:16:55.408 --> 01:16:57.341
let's just cut the shit.

01:16:57.343 --> 01:16:59.376
What, do you think
it was up to me?

01:16:59.378 --> 01:17:01.511
Jimmy went inside and then
Lloyd said that I was his.

01:17:01.513 --> 01:17:03.348
What the fuck was
I supposed to do?

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:05.249
There was
panic in Central City today

01:17:05.251 --> 01:17:09.053
after a gun battle
erupted onto busy streets.

01:17:09.055 --> 01:17:11.421
He keeps you in junk.

01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:14.224
Maybe he comes over, takes a
little piece whenever he wants.

01:17:14.226 --> 01:17:17.728
Maybe he loans you out for
once in a while, right?

01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:22.099
Has the fucking word no
ever occurred to you?

01:17:22.101 --> 01:17:23.501
What the fuck
world do you live in

01:17:23.503 --> 01:17:26.069
where you actually
have a choice?

01:17:28.107 --> 01:17:30.108
What do you think's
gonna happen to Jimmy

01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:32.046
when Lloyd finds him?

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.515
You think it's gonna be
the same like it was before

01:17:38.517 --> 01:17:39.686
and that's it?

01:17:48.028 --> 01:17:49.760
Where the fuck is he?

01:17:49.762 --> 01:17:51.362
Maybe I can get this
asshole's cuffs off

01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:54.064
and then let him do
what he came here to do.

01:17:54.066 --> 01:17:55.166
- Fuck you!
- Tell me where he is.

01:17:55.168 --> 01:17:56.134
- Where the fuck is he?
- Fuck you!

01:17:56.136 --> 01:17:58.736
- Where is he?
- Fuck you.

01:17:58.738 --> 01:18:01.773
You're not gonna
tell me where he is?

01:18:01.775 --> 01:18:02.775
Get out!

01:18:03.676 --> 01:18:05.076
- Call a cop.
- Get the fuck out!

01:18:05.078 --> 01:18:06.810
Call a fucking cop.

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:07.812
Call it.

01:18:11.784 --> 01:18:12.784
Yahtzee.

01:18:13.552 --> 01:18:14.419
Give me that.

01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:15.353
Yahtzee.

01:18:15.355 --> 01:18:16.357
Fuck off me.

01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:19.756
Okay, asshole.

01:18:19.758 --> 01:18:21.059
Come on, get up.

01:18:21.061 --> 01:18:22.061
Let's go.

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:24.498
Wakey, wakey.

01:18:25.632 --> 01:18:26.665
I'm gonna cut you loose.

01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:31.004
You're not gonna do
anything stupid, are you?

01:18:31.471 --> 01:18:32.471
Come on.

01:18:34.106 --> 01:18:35.141
Come on.

01:18:36.575 --> 01:18:37.575
That's it.

01:18:38.711 --> 01:18:40.077
Good?

01:18:40.079 --> 01:18:41.078
Yeah.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.181
Good boy.

01:18:48.187 --> 01:18:52.092
Does anybody know if
the bus comes around here?

01:19:59.859 --> 01:20:00.859
Jesus!

01:20:01.895 --> 01:20:02.895
Wayne.

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:07.197
Give me a fucking heart
attack for Christ's sake.

01:20:07.199 --> 01:20:09.466
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:20:09.468 --> 01:20:11.538
Why don't you sit down?

01:20:12.939 --> 01:20:14.274
Sit down, Wayne.

01:20:21.647 --> 01:20:24.282
Legs apart, hands on your knees.

01:20:24.284 --> 01:20:27.121
I said hands on
your knees, Wayne.

01:20:30.222 --> 01:20:32.158
I like your collection.

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:36.460
I used to make models as a kid.

01:20:36.462 --> 01:20:40.633
I always liked the attention
to detail, you know?

01:20:41.868 --> 01:20:43.201
The ones that you'd have
to soak in water first,

01:20:43.203 --> 01:20:44.969
I like those.

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:46.504
Yeah.

01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:50.543
Yeah, I've been collecting
them since I was a kid.

01:20:51.578 --> 01:20:52.977
Are you carrying?

01:20:52.979 --> 01:20:54.478
No.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.649
That's good.

01:20:56.982 --> 01:20:58.983
I don't understand.

01:20:58.985 --> 01:21:00.818
Was there a problem?

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.757
I haven't heard
anything from Nesto.

01:21:13.365 --> 01:21:14.534
I was the job.

01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.903
I came up to Ironwood to see you

01:21:19.905 --> 01:21:22.639
and Nesto had me
brokering my own hit.

01:21:22.641 --> 01:21:25.178
Turned out that way, yeah.

01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:29.412
I didn't know he
knew the Rubio thing.

01:21:29.414 --> 01:21:31.849
I didn't know he knew
I'd middled for him.

01:21:31.851 --> 01:21:34.254
Apparently you should have.

01:21:35.488 --> 01:21:37.921
I saw my shot, I took it.

01:21:37.923 --> 01:21:38.889
Anybody would have.

01:21:38.891 --> 01:21:39.823
You, Nesto.

01:21:39.825 --> 01:21:41.291
I ain't making no apologies.

01:21:41.293 --> 01:21:44.295
I ain't asking for one, Wayne.

01:21:44.297 --> 01:21:45.830
You know why I'm here.

01:21:45.832 --> 01:21:46.796
Yeah.

01:21:46.798 --> 01:21:47.798
Yeah.

01:21:49.534 --> 01:21:51.437
You can make it easier.

01:21:52.939 --> 01:21:54.738
You said you didn't push
buttons on people anymore.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.273
That's what you said.

01:21:56.275 --> 01:21:58.675
Yeah, well, things
change, Wayne.

01:22:04.717 --> 01:22:06.386
I should've known.

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.321
I ain't giving you the numbers.

01:22:10.323 --> 01:22:11.421
Yeah, you are.

01:22:11.423 --> 01:22:12.857
Tough shit.

01:22:12.859 --> 01:22:14.392
That ain't how this is
gonna go down, Wayne, alright?

01:22:14.394 --> 01:22:15.626
- I ain't giving you shit.
- Yeah, you are.

01:22:15.628 --> 01:22:16.794
You're gonna give me
those fucking numbers.

01:22:16.796 --> 01:22:17.961
You're not getting shit from me.

01:22:17.963 --> 01:22:19.296
Give me them fucking
numbers, Wayne.

01:22:19.298 --> 01:22:20.730
No.

01:22:20.732 --> 01:22:21.866
Now you're either gonna
give me them numbers

01:22:21.868 --> 01:22:26.405
or I'm gonna put a fucking
bullet through your heart.

01:22:33.378 --> 01:22:35.313
You do what you gotta do.

01:22:35.315 --> 01:22:36.915
You think I'm fucking
around here, Wayne?

01:22:37.482 --> 01:22:39.684
Lose the weight, kid.

01:22:41.421 --> 01:22:45.292
Put it down in front of you
nice and fucking slow, man.

01:22:49.329 --> 01:22:53.000
Now put your fucking
hands flat on the desk.

01:22:59.338 --> 01:23:00.837
God damn, Jimmy,

01:23:00.839 --> 01:23:04.108
this shit just gets more
entertaining by the minute.

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:06.410
Who's this piece of shit?

01:23:06.412 --> 01:23:07.444
Sills. Wayne Si...

01:23:09.748 --> 01:23:11.284
Nice to meet ya.

01:23:13.953 --> 01:23:16.453
You gotta know when to
cut bait sometimes, Jimmy.

01:23:16.455 --> 01:23:19.590
Guy wasn't gonna give you shit.

01:23:19.592 --> 01:23:21.992
You gotta roll up
your sleeves sometimes

01:23:21.994 --> 01:23:24.094
and do things yourself.

01:23:24.096 --> 01:23:28.299
A little old fashioned
elbow grease.

01:23:34.006 --> 01:23:35.740
All right, Jimmy.

01:23:35.742 --> 01:23:37.841
Let's put a round in him.

01:23:37.843 --> 01:23:40.443
Come on, get your hand up here.

01:23:40.445 --> 01:23:41.547
Take the gun.

01:23:42.914 --> 01:23:43.747
Come on.

01:23:43.749 --> 01:23:44.749
That a boy.

01:23:46.686 --> 01:23:47.686
Looks good.

01:23:51.423 --> 01:23:52.857
Do it.

01:23:54.694 --> 01:23:55.725
That's it.

01:23:55.727 --> 01:23:56.727
That a boy.

01:23:57.997 --> 01:23:58.962
Nice.

01:23:58.964 --> 01:24:00.499
All right, get up.

01:24:06.471 --> 01:24:08.406
You know what, I got good
news and I got bad news

01:24:08.408 --> 01:24:09.573
for you, Jimmy.

01:24:09.575 --> 01:24:12.943
Good news is I'm not gonna
squeeze you for the 10,000.

01:24:12.945 --> 01:24:15.880
Bad news is you're going inside

01:24:15.882 --> 01:24:19.683
and I'm gonna take
what's in the safe.

01:24:19.685 --> 01:24:20.917
Open it.

01:24:20.919 --> 01:24:22.152
It ain't that
easy, I've never...

01:24:22.154 --> 01:24:24.857
Get the fuck down
there and open it.

01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:28.459
I gotta get a feel
for it and the...

01:24:28.461 --> 01:24:29.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:29.662 --> 01:24:30.827
I'm a patient man, Jimmy.

01:24:30.829 --> 01:24:31.661
Come on.

01:24:31.663 --> 01:24:33.499
You got three minutes.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.200
Go.

01:24:38.503 --> 01:24:40.837
Come on, you're supposed to
have these magical fingers.

01:24:40.839 --> 01:24:41.671
Come on.

01:24:41.673 --> 01:24:43.506
Let's see what they got.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.436
Two minute 30 seconds.

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:12.504
Feel like I should be humming

01:25:12.506 --> 01:25:13.470
the theme song to
Jeopardy or something.

01:25:13.472 --> 01:25:16.240
I need something to
write with, come on.

01:25:16.242 --> 01:25:17.410
Here you go.

01:25:22.114 --> 01:25:23.114
Minute 45.

01:25:27.052 --> 01:25:28.521
Come on, Jimmy.

01:25:29.521 --> 01:25:32.555
Nice girl you got
there, by the way.

01:25:32.557 --> 01:25:33.592
Louly.

01:25:36.495 --> 01:25:37.728
Kinda girl makes you think

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:40.600
about setting down
some roots, huh?

01:25:42.802 --> 01:25:46.506
I mean the whole
junkie-whore thing aside.

01:25:52.677 --> 01:25:54.178
Minute 10, come on.

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.778
Focus, asshole.

01:25:59.685 --> 01:26:01.050
Come on man, I thought you were
supposed to be good at this.

01:26:01.052 --> 01:26:01.852
Let's go.

01:26:01.854 --> 01:26:03.155
Fucking come on.

01:26:04.723 --> 01:26:07.726
Come on!

01:26:12.198 --> 01:26:13.796
45 seconds, Jimmy.

01:26:18.803 --> 01:26:20.004
45 seconds, Jimmy.

01:26:20.006 --> 01:26:22.476
Don't fucking test
me, all right?

01:26:26.145 --> 01:26:27.310
15 seconds.

01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:32.650
10.

01:26:35.253 --> 01:26:37.089
Five fucking, come on!

01:26:39.691 --> 01:26:41.591
Come on, man, fucking do it.

01:26:42.328 --> 01:26:43.448
Hey, got it, got it, got it!

01:26:48.301 --> 01:26:50.637
Stand the fuck back.

01:26:52.672 --> 01:26:53.672
Holy shit.

01:26:57.610 --> 01:26:58.610
Yahtzee.

01:27:05.184 --> 01:27:06.649
Fill this up.

01:27:13.592 --> 01:27:15.095
Let's go, come on.

01:27:19.265 --> 01:27:21.267
Fuck, let's go, come on.

01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:26.370
Long time, Jimmy.

01:27:26.372 --> 01:27:27.606
Jack.

01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:29.709
Easy, Lloyd.

01:27:31.343 --> 01:27:34.143
Thing's liable to go
off for Christ's sake.

01:27:34.145 --> 01:27:36.582
Kinda the idea, ain't it?

01:27:37.283 --> 01:27:38.715
Go home, Lloyd.

01:27:38.717 --> 01:27:40.553
Can't do that, Jack.

01:27:41.387 --> 01:27:43.821
Then you're under arrest then.

01:27:43.823 --> 01:27:46.760
Funny, I don't
feel under arrest.

01:27:48.828 --> 01:27:50.094
I'm taking the bag.

01:27:50.096 --> 01:27:51.795
Jimmy too, he's coming with me.

01:27:51.797 --> 01:27:55.398
I'm through eating
your leftovers.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.300
Well, Lloyd, shit.

01:27:56.302 --> 01:27:58.202
You got things figured
out, don't you?

01:28:05.378 --> 01:28:07.745
You look good, Jimmy.

01:28:07.747 --> 01:28:09.647
Most guys can't
handle the stretch.

01:28:09.649 --> 01:28:10.548
A guy can't handle the stretch,

01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:12.715
he should be out
selling shoes, right?

01:28:12.717 --> 01:28:14.751
You queered my play.

01:28:14.753 --> 01:28:18.054
Four years back,
the jewelry store.

01:28:18.056 --> 01:28:19.657
You were gonna
execute the guard.

01:28:19.659 --> 01:28:21.392
My point exactly!

01:28:21.394 --> 01:28:23.327
You don't get in a man's way.

01:28:23.329 --> 01:28:25.429
He's gotta do what
he's gotta do.

01:28:25.431 --> 01:28:28.197
There's an ethics involved.

01:28:28.199 --> 01:28:30.233
Oh, come on, Lloyd.

01:28:30.235 --> 01:28:31.734
Four years is one thing.

01:28:31.736 --> 01:28:32.769
Murder rap's something else.

01:28:32.771 --> 01:28:33.771
You know that.

01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:38.675
Jimmy Hill.

01:28:38.677 --> 01:28:42.114
He's got the talent,
but not the stomach.

01:28:46.418 --> 01:28:49.318
Owed you that from
four years ago.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.720
This one?

01:28:50.722 --> 01:28:52.755
Just me being a prick.

01:28:53.993 --> 01:28:54.825
Fuck!

01:28:54.827 --> 01:28:56.326
She tell you about me?

01:28:56.328 --> 01:28:58.429
What the fuck
you talking about, Lloyd?

01:28:58.431 --> 01:29:00.130
Yeah.

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:02.933
Figured she might got a little
lonely when you got sent up.

01:29:02.935 --> 01:29:05.038
Tried my best to step in.

01:29:07.073 --> 01:29:08.304
Sweet ain't she?

01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:11.274
Best kinda junkie, too.

01:29:11.276 --> 01:29:15.649
You front her some shit,
she'll do whatever you want.

01:29:54.919 --> 01:29:55.919
Yeah.

01:30:02.794 --> 01:30:04.730
Do the math, homie.

01:30:15.173 --> 01:30:17.840
Little something for the effort.

01:30:21.846 --> 01:30:22.915
