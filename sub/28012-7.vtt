WEBVTT

00:00.812 --> 00:02.625
Previously on Proven Innocent...

00:02.662 --> 00:05.093
- We've never officially met.
- Rick Zahn. It's a pleasure.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.431
- I'm gonna need a lot of money.
- I will do everything I can

00:08.468 --> 00:10.325
to get you seated in the AG's office.

00:10.345 --> 00:11.612
My wife, she thinks I'm talking

00:11.649 --> 00:12.828
to my pastor right now.

00:12.905 --> 00:14.496
But you came to a therapist instead.

00:14.516 --> 00:16.265
Heather Husband asserts
that the defendant

00:16.303 --> 00:18.092
took a swing at them
with a baseball bat.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.593
No, Brian came at me.

00:19.630 --> 00:21.421
We will be seeking 25 years in prison.

00:21.523 --> 00:23.264
It's a news story about you.

00:23.358 --> 00:25.766
"Scott's prime suspects
include her brother."

00:25.860 --> 00:27.026
That's Dylan's paper.

00:27.144 --> 00:29.195
- His name is in the byline.
- He was using me.

00:29.232 --> 00:30.488
I'm so sorry.

00:38.214 --> 00:40.115
Success comes from experience.

00:40.366 --> 00:42.216
Easy and I use what happened to me

00:42.253 --> 00:44.101
in the justice system as motivation.

00:44.128 --> 00:45.522
I lived the hell.

00:45.559 --> 00:46.854
We don't want another innocent person

00:46.878 --> 00:48.105
to have to go through that.

00:48.190 --> 00:51.108
And being good at what we do
doesn't hurt either.

00:51.174 --> 00:53.363
Does taking "winner" cases

00:53.400 --> 00:54.800
help your firm, too?

00:55.948 --> 00:58.681
Y'all seem to only take
the flashy, newsworthy cases

00:58.718 --> 01:00.451
everybody knows about.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.285
Just like your case, Ms. Scott.

01:02.338 --> 01:05.230
- That's not necessarily true.
- You make headlines on the backs

01:05.268 --> 01:08.216
of the wrongfully accused.
Let's keep it real, Ms. Scott.

01:08.294 --> 01:09.685
You miss the attention.

01:09.762 --> 01:11.097
I don't miss anything about losing

01:11.121 --> 01:13.148
ten years of my life to prison.

01:13.226 --> 01:14.550
I did 20.

01:15.871 --> 01:17.836
Wrongfully convicted, just like you.

01:18.228 --> 01:20.211
I got out thanks to
the dedicated lawyers

01:20.248 --> 01:21.396
at the Innocence Project.

01:21.537 --> 01:22.748
That's great, miss...

01:22.785 --> 01:24.409
Amina Jackson.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.252
I'm a civil rights activist,

01:26.329 --> 01:28.588
and an organizer for the folks
here in East Cleveland.

01:29.874 --> 01:31.257
This is my community.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.003
That is great, Ms. Jackson,

01:36.097 --> 01:37.930
but I just want to
make one thing clear.

01:38.049 --> 01:41.390
Our firm takes every
deserving client we come across.

01:41.427 --> 01:43.418
We don't care if the client is famous

01:43.496 --> 01:44.896
or if the trial will make the news.

01:44.963 --> 01:47.331
We believe the justice system
is flawed.

01:47.401 --> 01:48.833
And we are here to help fix that.

01:49.027 --> 01:50.926
We're trying to end these mistakes.

01:51.003 --> 01:52.628
Please.

01:52.864 --> 01:55.078
There ain't no ending anything
when you come from

01:55.115 --> 01:57.191
an underprivileged and dying community.

01:57.309 --> 01:59.098
If someone needs our help,
we don't give a damn

01:59.122 --> 02:00.552
where they come from.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.685
Good.

02:03.148 --> 02:06.154
An innocent East Cleve man,
Davon Watkins,

02:06.236 --> 02:08.902
is on death row,
blamed for murdering a cop.

02:09.383 --> 02:11.029
He's not famous.

02:11.294 --> 02:13.270
And he's poor as dirt.

02:13.821 --> 02:15.070
You ready to fight the case

02:15.107 --> 02:17.557
that everybody else was
too damn afraid to take?

02:20.629 --> 02:24.010
Like I said, no attorney
in Ohio will touch it.

02:24.260 --> 02:26.216
It's because Davon was a drug dealer.

02:26.369 --> 02:28.101
Davon is not a saint,

02:28.521 --> 02:30.628
but he for sure ain't a killer.

02:30.665 --> 02:33.280
Davon grew up
three houses away from me.

02:33.512 --> 02:35.488
I know him like I'd know
my own brother.

02:35.606 --> 02:38.658
And there is no way
he killed an undercover cop.

02:38.857 --> 02:39.981
Why'd they arrest him?

02:40.018 --> 02:41.994
Because of the car he was driving.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.238
There was a drive-by shooting
in the park.

02:44.314 --> 02:46.332
A bullet hit an undercover cop.

02:46.450 --> 02:48.483
Folks say the shooter
was a man with a gun,

02:48.520 --> 02:49.625
driving a black Impala.

02:49.662 --> 02:51.182
Yeah, but it couldn't have been Davon.

02:51.441 --> 02:54.064
He was picking me up from the grocery

02:54.216 --> 02:56.233
like he always do
the first of the month.

02:56.630 --> 02:58.235
The cops didn't believe his alibi?

02:58.262 --> 02:59.997
You know how it goes.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.274
One of their own gets hit,
and they come down with a fury.

03:03.431 --> 03:05.092
There was some mistake.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.478
Davon is innocent.

03:09.954 --> 03:11.190
Can we help them?

03:11.273 --> 03:12.845
A cop killer? That's rough.

03:12.882 --> 03:13.991
Well, maybe we could.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.704
You said he's on death row, right?

03:15.782 --> 03:17.462
Can you imagine how horrible that is?

03:17.499 --> 03:19.657
Yeah, I can imagine.
I work with you every day.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.266
We've never tried
a death penalty case before.

03:23.184 --> 03:25.020
We'd have to file a motion
for permission

03:25.057 --> 03:26.985
to appear pro hac vice in Ohio.

03:27.110 --> 03:28.487
So you're doing this?

03:28.524 --> 03:29.797
I think we should look into it.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.577
Why? Because Amina Jackson
dared you to?

03:32.614 --> 03:34.213
No, because I believe her.

03:34.331 --> 03:35.789
The client is a known drug dealer.

03:35.908 --> 03:37.950
The victim is an undercover
narcotics officer.

03:38.005 --> 03:40.409
There's no evidence
of prosecutory misconduct

03:40.446 --> 03:42.068
or police abuse.

03:42.394 --> 03:43.742
I'm curious.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.235 --> 04:13.327
Death is the ultimate price
to pay for any crime.

04:13.445 --> 04:16.829
It's also an admission that
our criminal justice system

04:16.949 --> 04:18.914
is really about revenge.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.093
On this week's Until Proven Innocent,

04:21.253 --> 04:23.429
we'll discuss the case
of Davon Watkins,

04:23.932 --> 04:25.783
a man sentenced to death.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.662
We'll talk about the death penalty.

04:27.709 --> 04:30.436
And whether you think
it's good for society or not,

04:30.596 --> 04:33.475
you should know that
it is used disproportionately

04:33.512 --> 04:35.935
against the poor and minorities.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.139
And more than that,
since humans are fallible,

04:40.556 --> 04:43.282
what happens when
we execute the innocent?

04:43.922 --> 04:45.745
It is a decision...

04:46.014 --> 04:48.204
that can never be undone.

04:52.243 --> 04:53.700
Hey, D.

04:54.459 --> 04:55.961
Sis.

04:56.509 --> 04:57.851
Hi, Davon.

04:57.888 --> 04:59.346
I'm Madeline Scott.

04:59.689 --> 05:01.420
Amina said you had a partner.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, Easy.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.357
He couldn't make it... issue
with another one of our cases.

05:05.607 --> 05:08.382
Yeah? Or is it an issue with my case?

05:08.500 --> 05:09.857
That's not it at all.

05:09.994 --> 05:11.960
Easy's never been afraid
of taking chances,

05:11.979 --> 05:13.387
and neither am I.

05:13.505 --> 05:14.888
You're what kind of lawyer?

05:15.007 --> 05:16.561
Reinsurance investigations.

05:16.598 --> 05:18.522
- That sounds kind of boring.
- It definitely is.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.969
You know, I'm sorry,
Mr. Boudreau, you just...

05:20.988 --> 05:23.230
you don't seem like the right
kind of lawyer for my case.

05:23.462 --> 05:25.658
But you wrote me a letter,
not the other way around.

05:25.695 --> 05:28.112
Maybe we should just see how this goes.

05:28.329 --> 05:30.321
She's cool, Davon.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.416
So...

05:44.453 --> 05:47.012
a taxi driver named Sasha Novak
saw the crime.

05:47.131 --> 05:48.859
Identified you as the shooter.

05:49.038 --> 05:51.183
He's lying, 'cause I wasn't there.

05:51.659 --> 05:53.578
I swear on my mother's grave

05:53.644 --> 05:55.528
I didn't kill no cop.

05:55.806 --> 05:57.523
All right? I don't even own a gun.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.588
Mr. Novak also told the police
that he said

06:00.625 --> 06:02.586
the shooter was driving
a black Impala that night

06:02.623 --> 06:05.606
and that he saw the first four
digits of the license plate

06:05.700 --> 06:07.608
which were an exact match to your car.

06:07.726 --> 06:08.858
Can you explain that?

06:08.895 --> 06:10.870
He can't explain it.

06:11.194 --> 06:13.313
- Isn't that your job?
- No, my job is to find out

06:13.350 --> 06:15.147
if there's a path to exoneration.

06:15.511 --> 06:17.101
It wasn't even my car.

06:17.485 --> 06:20.362
All right? I was borrowing it
from my homie, Ray...

06:21.578 --> 06:23.132
Who's Ray?

06:26.387 --> 06:27.961
Ray Gibbs.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.015
He used to run drugs
with Davon back in the day.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.686
All right.

06:36.955 --> 06:39.363
I think the cops...
I think the cops fed

06:39.400 --> 06:41.233
that taxi driver some information.

06:41.475 --> 06:44.069
Told him what to say, told him
my license plate, all that.

06:44.350 --> 06:45.963
What happened
when they pulled you over?

06:46.069 --> 06:48.363
They just ran up on me
with their guns out

06:48.400 --> 06:49.889
and started screaming,

06:49.926 --> 06:52.152
"G-Get out the car, get on the ground."

06:53.105 --> 06:55.505
Then they cuffed me and just
threw me in the back of the car.

06:55.532 --> 06:57.332
Did they tell you why
you were being arrested?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.418
They said a witness ID'd me.

07:00.022 --> 07:02.087
Lying taxi driver.

07:02.491 --> 07:04.858
If Mr. Novak is lying...

07:05.272 --> 07:06.788
why'd he pick you?

07:07.397 --> 07:09.336
Did you know him? Did he dislike you?

07:09.430 --> 07:12.850
A-All I know is that he said
I was the shooter.

07:12.962 --> 07:14.294
But he's wrong.

07:14.430 --> 07:15.917
You hear me?

07:16.713 --> 07:18.897
I didn't-I didn't do this.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.303
I'm on the street 15, 16 hours a day.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.764
I know what's going on out there.

07:28.974 --> 07:31.766
I see that Impala
cruising by real slow.

07:32.070 --> 07:34.453
I know it's dopers or worse.

07:34.571 --> 07:36.438
And I was right, too,
because an hour later,

07:36.873 --> 07:39.441
same car drives by...

07:39.605 --> 07:41.201
Poor cop gets killed.

07:41.418 --> 07:43.919
You knew the victim,
Steve Sampson, was a cop?

07:44.147 --> 07:46.373
No, not at the time. Afterwards.

07:46.702 --> 07:49.925
And you have zero doubt about
your recollection, then or now?

07:49.962 --> 07:51.764
Zero. I saw what happened.

07:51.806 --> 07:53.962
The punk drives by, shoots the cop

07:53.999 --> 07:55.382
and then drives off.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.407
I mean, I immediately
radioed the-the cops

07:57.444 --> 07:58.738
and I gave them the make, the model

07:58.762 --> 07:59.961
and the license plate number.

07:59.981 --> 08:01.463
And then I ID'd him.

08:01.631 --> 08:03.465
You went down to the station
for a lineup?

08:03.561 --> 08:05.267
No, I drove around with them
for a few blocks

08:05.291 --> 08:07.308
till we saw that same car
with the license plate.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.563
They asked me if the punk
handcuffed inside

08:09.657 --> 08:11.231
is the shooter and I says, "Yeah."

08:11.325 --> 08:13.066
And then they put him
in the-the police car.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.402
He was already in handcuffs
when you ID'd him?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.237
Yeah, thankfully.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.964
You know, cops ought
to be grateful that I'm around.

08:20.165 --> 08:22.324
You know, I saw that same damn car,

08:22.361 --> 08:24.986
same damn license plate,
two days later.

08:25.665 --> 08:27.898
I have an eagle eye
for this kind of thing.

08:28.410 --> 08:30.019
Look, I got to get back. We done here?

08:30.056 --> 08:32.698
Sure. Thanks.

08:35.668 --> 08:38.173
I told you he was a liar.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.744
He saw the same car
with the same license plate

08:40.793 --> 08:42.707
two days later? It's impossible.

08:42.744 --> 08:44.767
Yeah, absolutely. The cops
would have impounded the car

08:44.791 --> 08:46.358
if it was involved in a crime.

08:46.705 --> 08:48.196
Told you.

08:49.097 --> 08:51.029
Something doesn't add up.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.389
So tell me...

08:53.504 --> 08:56.368
you gonna take Davon's
death penalty case or not?

08:57.325 --> 08:58.959
I'm in.

09:05.769 --> 09:06.873
Morning.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.234
Good morning.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.144
The hell's going on?

09:13.830 --> 09:15.388
Zahn's people have invaded.

09:15.457 --> 09:17.769
Campaign strategy's being
formed, lots of bodies.

09:17.806 --> 09:20.028
Guess that's what happens when
you have an unlimited bankroll.

09:20.052 --> 09:22.631
Well, they can't have a campaign
headquarters in my office.

09:22.668 --> 09:23.799
Why didn't you tell them that?

09:23.823 --> 09:25.103
What are you both doing out here?

09:25.127 --> 09:26.396
Excellent question.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.592
- They're not listening to us.
- Not at all.

09:28.629 --> 09:29.761
I was trying to infuse your idea

09:29.785 --> 09:31.397
about Rosemary's Law
into their strategies...

09:31.421 --> 09:32.642
There he is Mr. Bellows.

09:32.679 --> 09:34.155
Such a pleasure to finally meet you.

09:34.192 --> 09:35.654
Noah Weiss, campaign strategist.

09:35.691 --> 09:37.301
I'm sure Mr. Zahn has mentioned me.

09:37.338 --> 09:39.020
Well, not... specifically,

09:39.057 --> 09:41.490
but, you can't... be here.

09:41.527 --> 09:43.154
- There are laws.
- That's understood.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.888
We're finding space across the street.

09:44.925 --> 09:46.506
In the meantime, what I need from you

09:46.543 --> 09:48.495
is your reaction
to what we've been working on.

09:48.613 --> 09:50.558
- So...
- You know, Mr. Weiss?

09:50.738 --> 09:52.590
- Noah.
- Noah.

09:52.627 --> 09:54.598
You've met Connor Mayfeld
and Isabel Sanchez,

09:54.635 --> 09:56.407
they're both on my campaign staff.

09:56.450 --> 09:58.524
Perhaps you should hear some
of their ideas as well.

09:58.590 --> 10:01.435
Of course. You folks had a really cagey

10:01.472 --> 10:03.826
and pinpointed operation here,
but I think Mr. Zahn

10:03.863 --> 10:05.846
has something more grand in mind.

10:05.883 --> 10:06.949
Sorry, grand?

10:06.986 --> 10:09.039
Well, with the kind of cash infusion
that he's talking about,

10:09.063 --> 10:10.680
we're gonna need to change
the entire structure

10:10.704 --> 10:11.602
of the campaign.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.268
It's time to go big.

10:13.433 --> 10:15.597
- How big?
- Nine figures big.

10:16.484 --> 10:18.646
In a post-Citizens United
world, this is it.

10:18.683 --> 10:20.929
This is the only way to win.
And in the last three years,

10:20.974 --> 10:23.623
my firm has won dozens
of elections at every level.

10:23.660 --> 10:25.290
I promise you, sir,

10:26.002 --> 10:28.995
you're gonna be really happy
with the results.

10:29.519 --> 10:31.015
Thank you, sir.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.347
This is ridiculous.

10:33.472 --> 10:35.537
Mr. Big-Time New Yorker, he can't just

10:35.582 --> 10:37.064
come in here and tell us
how to do our jobs.

10:37.088 --> 10:38.412
Train is racing ahead, Connor.

10:39.026 --> 10:40.586
If you want to stay
my campaign manager,

10:40.613 --> 10:41.945
you better get out
the knives and show me

10:41.969 --> 10:44.957
why it ought to be you instead
of Mr. Big-Time New Yorker.

10:51.543 --> 10:52.876
All right, good news, guys.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.475
I spoke with the East Cleveland police

10:54.512 --> 10:56.311
and they confirmed
that Davon's black Impala

10:56.348 --> 10:58.991
was indeed impounded
for six weeks after his arrest.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.234
So the cabbie must've seen
a different black Impala?

11:01.347 --> 11:02.513
Yeah, exactly.

11:02.550 --> 11:04.329
They also confirmed
that his black Impala

11:04.366 --> 11:06.784
was stolen from a,
car rental agency.

11:07.254 --> 11:10.232
Okay, so Davon's buddy Ray
stole an Impala

11:10.269 --> 11:13.668
and then loaned it to Davon?
How does this help our case?

11:13.832 --> 11:15.223
I don't know,

11:15.299 --> 11:17.419
but I don't see you bringing
anything to this meeting.

11:17.785 --> 11:19.301
I brought the cappuccinos.

11:19.761 --> 11:21.513
We need to go back to Cleveland.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.707
No, thank you.

11:22.744 --> 11:24.298
Other than the
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,

11:24.322 --> 11:26.183
there's nothing for me there.
Take Boudreau.

11:26.246 --> 11:29.262
Wish I could, but I have
other pressing court dates.

11:29.504 --> 11:30.967
You're still against Davon's case?

11:31.004 --> 11:32.964
I didn't say that,
but we have other clients, too.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.751
You got this.

11:34.884 --> 11:37.552
Take Bodie and Violet as backup.

11:38.085 --> 11:39.651
Are you guys talking about me?

11:39.750 --> 11:41.010
- Nope.
- Yup.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.961
It's a sweet ride.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.107
I can get you a deal
on the weekly rental.

11:57.168 --> 11:59.943
I'm looking for something
a little more, you know, unique.

12:00.078 --> 12:01.795
These cars are all identical.

12:01.913 --> 12:04.205
Yeah, we buy them at fleet rates
to keep the costs down.

12:04.654 --> 12:06.034
I mean, they're literally identical,

12:06.058 --> 12:07.654
even the license plates are sequential.

12:07.691 --> 12:08.980
What do you-what do you guys do,

12:09.017 --> 12:10.794
send all the paperwork into the DMV

12:10.831 --> 12:12.496
at the same time or something?

12:12.636 --> 12:15.433
- You with the cops?
- Nah.

12:15.593 --> 12:17.978
I'm trying to get an
innocent guy off death row.

12:18.096 --> 12:20.402
Hey, you guys keep good records?

12:20.496 --> 12:22.148
Yeah, sure. What do you need?

12:22.267 --> 12:24.902
Looking for a 2004 black Impala.

12:24.939 --> 12:26.231
- All right.
- Would've been rented out.

12:26.255 --> 12:27.777
March 1, 2006.

12:27.902 --> 12:30.905
And boom goes the dynamite.

12:31.161 --> 12:34.058
You guys had six black Impalas.

12:34.394 --> 12:35.587
You think they all had

12:35.624 --> 12:37.293
consecutive license plates like these?

12:37.379 --> 12:39.005
Identical except the last digit.

12:39.316 --> 12:40.834
Interesting.

12:45.027 --> 12:47.589
- Ray.
- Hey. What's up, Amina?

12:47.633 --> 12:49.832
- Hey. How you doing, man?
- Good, how are you?

12:49.879 --> 12:51.318
Um, good.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.663
You got a couple of minutes
for some questions?

12:53.869 --> 12:56.109
Hey, look, I don't know nothing
about nothing, all right?

12:56.246 --> 12:58.944
Come on, Ray, act like you got
some home training.

12:59.472 --> 13:01.839
These folks here to talk about Davon.

13:02.511 --> 13:04.418
Davon's life is on the line,

13:04.871 --> 13:07.378
and we understand that
you used to deal drugs

13:07.415 --> 13:08.856
with him years ago.

13:09.293 --> 13:11.606
Yeah, and that's just
what it was Years ago.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.590
I'm a whole barber now, as you can see.

13:13.666 --> 13:15.074
We respect that.

13:15.363 --> 13:16.915
We just want to know if
you can tell us about

13:16.939 --> 13:18.939
the car you loaned Davon
the night he was arrested.

13:18.976 --> 13:20.601
Hey, look, if y'all
ain't no paying clientele,

13:20.625 --> 13:22.065
y'all get the hell out, straight up.

13:22.277 --> 13:24.504
- For real, for real?
- For real.

13:26.307 --> 13:29.049
Man.

13:29.229 --> 13:30.788
This some bull.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.552
You want a fade, man?

13:34.589 --> 13:36.371
The hell I'm supposed to do with this?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.725
Just make me pretty, man,
just make me pretty.

13:38.802 --> 13:40.819
That's hard work.

13:41.027 --> 13:43.535
Look, I ain't steal no car.

13:43.785 --> 13:45.572
I don't want that type
of hassle, you know.

13:45.609 --> 13:49.386
Yeah, but your name isn't on
any of the car rental records.

13:49.738 --> 13:51.479
That joint neighborhood-owned,

13:51.516 --> 13:52.939
more like "hood-owned."

13:53.060 --> 13:54.310
Drug runs?

13:54.347 --> 13:56.001
Make running product a little easier.

13:56.078 --> 14:00.005
They loaned out cars
off the books to drug gangs?

14:00.136 --> 14:02.563
Hell yeah. Every Vice Lord
know the drill.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.707
Man, you show that money,
them keys yours.

14:04.902 --> 14:06.394
So there could've been
another black Impala

14:06.418 --> 14:07.521
on the road that night.

14:07.605 --> 14:09.837
Definitely. I mean, name one hustler

14:09.874 --> 14:11.815
that don't want to drive an Impala.

14:13.129 --> 14:15.233
Why you ain't say that
at Davon's first trial?

14:15.270 --> 14:16.987
Because ain't nobody asked me.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.180
All we have to do is find out

14:19.217 --> 14:20.828
who was driving the other Impalas,

14:20.865 --> 14:21.948
we'll find the shooter.

14:21.985 --> 14:23.910
Good luck with that.

14:24.062 --> 14:25.386
Meaning?

14:25.566 --> 14:27.732
Meaning this is East Cleveland.

14:27.829 --> 14:30.481
If you snitch, you're dead.

14:30.587 --> 14:31.905
Facts.

14:35.026 --> 14:36.612
I know you're pissed off about

14:36.666 --> 14:38.824
the Dylan article. I'm angry too.

14:38.863 --> 14:40.862
- But you can't keep avoiding me.
- Nah, actually,

14:40.899 --> 14:42.565
it's better this way.

14:42.666 --> 14:44.383
Less I'm with you,

14:44.707 --> 14:46.459
less I'm in the paper.

14:46.691 --> 14:49.388
He's out of my life, all right?
He used me.

14:49.425 --> 14:51.216
He wrote what you told him,

14:51.720 --> 14:53.511
that you think that I killed Rosemary.

14:53.636 --> 14:55.227
I...

14:56.074 --> 14:59.162
Look, you were right, okay?
About Heather and the Adderall.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.519
I spoke to Linda Barrett and she's...

15:00.543 --> 15:02.103
Well, none of that was in
the article, was it?

15:02.127 --> 15:03.459
Well, I didn't know that Dylan would...

15:03.483 --> 15:05.944
Yeah, you did!
You of all people would know.

15:06.232 --> 15:08.148
Come on, Maddie, when we were on trial

15:08.187 --> 15:10.163
you knew that we had to stick together,

15:10.318 --> 15:11.579
'cause anything that we could say,

15:11.603 --> 15:13.762
it would-it would come back to hurt us.

15:14.296 --> 15:16.112
And guess what,
now I'm the one that's hurt.

15:16.497 --> 15:18.484
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not, though.

15:18.521 --> 15:20.695
You're happy,
because now you have everything

15:20.732 --> 15:21.856
just the way that you want it.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.723
- What does that mean?
- It means that big brother

15:23.747 --> 15:25.678
screws up and little sister
gets to come and bail him out.

15:25.702 --> 15:27.852
- That's our pattern.
- Well, that's not fair.

15:28.051 --> 15:29.884
I love you and I want to help you.

15:30.167 --> 15:31.842
Maybe if you didn't
screw up all the time

15:31.879 --> 15:33.388
with the lying and the drugs.

15:33.764 --> 15:35.738
You make it so difficult
for me to trust you.

15:35.775 --> 15:36.998
I make it difficult?

15:37.044 --> 15:38.668
You're the one that just poisoned

15:38.705 --> 15:40.021
a jury in my assault case.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.792
You don't have to worry
about that, all right?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.116
I will instruct the jury

15:43.153 --> 15:44.558
- to make sure that they...
- No, no, no.

15:44.582 --> 15:45.967
Don't do anything.

15:46.801 --> 15:48.194
I'm firing you.

15:48.366 --> 15:51.334
- Take my chances with legal aid.
- Levi, don't be stu...

15:53.745 --> 15:55.279
That's a mistake.

15:56.617 --> 15:58.559
At least it's my mistake now.

15:58.677 --> 16:00.529
This one has nothing to do with you.

16:04.435 --> 16:07.330
- You got a lawyer?
- No, I kind of have a lawyer.

16:07.570 --> 16:09.552
He does reinsurance law.

16:09.779 --> 16:12.013
I wrote a letter
to every lawyer in Illinois.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.870
I thought only the criminal
lawyers would respond,

16:13.894 --> 16:16.654
but he says he's trying something new.

16:16.787 --> 16:18.209
What kind of fool is this?

16:18.246 --> 16:19.740
You know, he didn't look like a fool.

16:19.826 --> 16:22.295
He was actually
a young, handsome black man.

16:22.365 --> 16:24.209
- You never said he was black.
- So?

16:24.311 --> 16:25.420
Come on, a black guy,

16:25.457 --> 16:27.638
helping the white infamous
girl in a murder rap?

16:27.675 --> 16:28.956
You're not gonna see a guy like that

16:28.980 --> 16:30.420
answering any of my letters.

16:30.617 --> 16:33.135
Maybe that's 'cause
you didn't write any letters.

16:34.546 --> 16:37.196
Maybe that's 'cause
I'm guilty as all hell.

16:41.829 --> 16:44.654
Maybe we should just bring the
rental car company into court.

16:44.691 --> 16:47.224
Multiple Impalas?
That has got to be a slam dunk.

16:47.284 --> 16:49.623
Madeline's good, but she's not,
like, LeBron James

16:49.668 --> 16:51.600
- of the Cleveland courtroom.
- Doesn't LeBron

16:51.637 --> 16:53.638
- play for the Lakers now?
- Yeah, he does.

16:53.694 --> 16:55.786
And that's one of the reasons
that Cleveland's so depressing.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.695
Okay. Let's stay focused.
Yes, I will bring that to court.

16:58.732 --> 17:00.276
We still need to find the real shooter.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.943
Yeah, so does Cleveland.

17:02.392 --> 17:03.819
All right, so, I got good news.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.318
We found the other witness.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.926
Wait. What's this "we"?
I tracked her down.

17:07.964 --> 17:09.464
I showed you where to look.

17:09.501 --> 17:11.589
Nancy Curtis.
She was married and divorced

17:11.626 --> 17:13.140
a couple times since Davon's trial,

17:13.176 --> 17:14.647
which is why she was
so difficult to find.

17:14.672 --> 17:16.258
She testified at Davon's trial

17:16.295 --> 17:18.775
that she saw the shooting from
her window across from the park.

17:19.029 --> 17:21.584
This is great. We'll talk to her.

17:21.935 --> 17:24.397
Okay, sorry, I have to
take care of something

17:24.435 --> 17:25.891
before we head back to Cleveland.

17:26.037 --> 17:28.410
- Hot date?
- We'll go up there tomorrow.

17:29.052 --> 17:30.843
See you later.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.082
My wife and I were headed for our car

17:33.119 --> 17:35.334
when Levi just came out of nowhere

17:35.371 --> 17:36.487
with a baseball bat.

17:36.524 --> 17:38.789
He swung at Heather, but I blocked it.

17:38.930 --> 17:41.314
He punched me, but I disarmed him.

17:41.559 --> 17:43.091
He's lying.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.170
Did you or your wife

17:45.209 --> 17:46.435
provoke Mr. Scott?

17:46.472 --> 17:48.108
No, no, no, no, he just-just

17:48.145 --> 17:50.135
came at us.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.451
We're lucky to be alive.

17:56.153 --> 17:57.608
Your witness.

18:00.748 --> 18:03.914
When I agreed to substitute
in on this case

18:03.951 --> 18:05.578
for the vacationing Judge Boxer,

18:05.615 --> 18:08.883
I promised to quickly
clear her calendar.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.620
I keep my promises, Mr. McGuire,
so, quickly.

18:11.909 --> 18:15.569
Yes, Your Honor, just, one moment.

18:18.088 --> 18:20.196
No further questions.

18:22.023 --> 18:23.545
It's frustrating.

18:24.584 --> 18:26.726
I want to be open and honest
about my emotions,

18:26.763 --> 18:28.560
but I don't want to seem unstable.

18:29.248 --> 18:31.501
Well, I don't see
what's open and honest

18:31.538 --> 18:33.398
about skulking around
with your therapist

18:33.435 --> 18:34.662
and not telling your wife.

18:34.699 --> 18:36.272
Nobody's skulking.

18:36.309 --> 18:39.115
Easy and I have been
discussing some changes

18:39.209 --> 18:40.897
that he's been experiencing
in his life.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.819
I'll tell you when things changed.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.109
When he answered
Madeline Scott's letter.

18:46.146 --> 18:48.099
Yeah, see, here we go,
blaming Madeline again for ev...

18:48.123 --> 18:51.111
No, baby, I don't blame her,
I blame you.

18:51.912 --> 18:55.857
You made the decision to change
your life, change your career,

18:56.279 --> 18:58.881
and change the time that you
spend with your family.

18:59.068 --> 19:01.837
That's all you, not Madeline.

19:02.614 --> 19:04.836
And what I really want to know

19:05.340 --> 19:08.435
is where was your family
when you made this decision?

19:08.522 --> 19:10.443
Because this affects us, too.

19:10.599 --> 19:12.222
Easy?

19:13.060 --> 19:15.276
Any idea as to why?

19:17.711 --> 19:19.920
I needed something more.

19:21.888 --> 19:25.038
- More than your family?
- That's not what I'm saying.

19:26.029 --> 19:27.920
I love you, I love my family.

19:28.326 --> 19:30.683
But... just...

19:31.013 --> 19:33.099
Easy, let me ask you this.

19:33.513 --> 19:36.203
Whatever it is you need in your life,

19:36.240 --> 19:38.982
can some of that
come from your marriage,

19:39.074 --> 19:40.348
your family?

19:40.385 --> 19:41.568
Yes.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.126
Absolutely.

19:45.662 --> 19:48.930
Irene, what do you think?

19:51.887 --> 19:54.029
I honestly don't know anymore.

19:59.756 --> 20:02.323
He was wildly swinging
the baseball bat.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.975
I think it hit my husband in the face.

20:05.326 --> 20:07.037
He threatened to kill us.

20:07.170 --> 20:10.159
- What did he say?
- I don't recall, exactly.

20:10.196 --> 20:12.080
I was terrified.

20:12.390 --> 20:14.423
I'm still having nightmares.

20:14.576 --> 20:17.531
I can just see these vacant, soulless,

20:17.568 --> 20:19.209
killer eyes.

20:19.472 --> 20:22.131
I'm just grateful
my baby girl wasn't there.

20:22.724 --> 20:25.571
Thank you. Your witness.

20:27.912 --> 20:31.344
Um... Mrs. Husband,

20:31.381 --> 20:33.354
where did Levi get the bat from?

20:33.779 --> 20:35.037
I don't know.

20:35.074 --> 20:37.943
I didn't catch a store label
while he was swinging.

20:38.357 --> 20:39.627
Apologies, I meant,

20:39.664 --> 20:42.601
where did Levi retrieve
the-the bat from,

20:42.638 --> 20:44.187
his car or...?

20:44.578 --> 20:46.128
You'd have to ask him.

20:46.165 --> 20:48.216
He's the one that tried
to kill us with it.

20:58.370 --> 21:00.592
Madeline Scott for the defense,
Your Honor.

21:00.804 --> 21:03.086
Objection. Ms. Scott is no longer

21:03.123 --> 21:04.406
defense counsel on this case.

21:04.451 --> 21:07.462
The defendant has the right
to add me to the defense team.

21:07.783 --> 21:09.407
Levi?

21:11.285 --> 21:15.052
Let her. You may end up
in jail with me.

21:17.299 --> 21:18.607
It's fine.

21:18.644 --> 21:21.154
Ms. Scott, you may proceed.

21:24.342 --> 21:27.451
Tell us, Heather,
where was your baby girl?

21:27.545 --> 21:29.209
She was waiting in the car.

21:29.295 --> 21:31.305
Waiting for what?
For you and your husband

21:31.342 --> 21:33.795
to confront Levi
with your baseball bat?

21:33.943 --> 21:37.381
No. I left my scarf on the field.

21:37.476 --> 21:39.693
And it took the two of you
to retrieve a scarf?

21:39.901 --> 21:41.368
It's a nice scarf.

21:42.537 --> 21:45.167
You said that Levi threatened you. Why?

21:46.310 --> 21:48.987
I don't know. He just did.

21:49.435 --> 21:51.546
Levi has always been violent,

21:51.910 --> 21:53.335
ever since high school.

21:53.461 --> 21:55.328
When was Levi violent in high school?

21:56.037 --> 21:57.605
You'd know better than anybody.

21:57.837 --> 21:59.320
I'll ask the question again.

21:59.357 --> 22:02.851
When did you personally see Levi
be violent in high school?

22:03.398 --> 22:05.020
He killed Rosemary Lynch.

22:05.582 --> 22:08.092
I saw him standing over her dead body.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.185
What's more violent than that?

22:10.787 --> 22:12.156
You saw that?

22:12.193 --> 22:13.770
- Yes.
- Really?

22:13.982 --> 22:16.094
Because at our trial,
I distinctly remember

22:16.131 --> 22:18.474
that you said that you were
with Linda Barrett.

22:18.967 --> 22:20.789
That you never saw Rosemary's body.

22:20.826 --> 22:22.836
So were you lying then
or are you lying now?

22:22.873 --> 22:25.984
I can't remember what I said
17 years ago.

22:26.021 --> 22:27.086
I do.

22:27.123 --> 22:30.295
I have read those transcripts
dozens of times.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.037
You're a liar.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.000
In fact, this whole case

22:34.037 --> 22:36.578
is nothing more than a personal
vendetta against my brother.

22:36.615 --> 22:38.555
- Isn't that right?
- Objection, Your Honor.

22:38.592 --> 22:40.601
Defense counsel is offering testimony.

22:40.638 --> 22:42.476
Withdrawn. I'll ask again,

22:42.513 --> 22:45.459
when did you see Levi be violent?

22:45.522 --> 22:48.627
He hit my husband in the face
with a baseball bat.

22:49.726 --> 22:52.373
The bat hit your husband in the face?

22:52.448 --> 22:56.013
Because your husband just testified

22:56.058 --> 22:57.185
that Levi punched him.

22:57.222 --> 22:58.865
So which was it, a bat or a fist?

22:58.902 --> 23:01.891
It... it all happened so fast.

23:01.928 --> 23:03.404
Levi is a killer.

23:03.451 --> 23:04.917
You know, since you can't
tell this court

23:04.941 --> 23:06.667
the difference
between a bat and a fist,

23:06.704 --> 23:08.064
I'd say that you're a liar.

23:08.101 --> 23:09.888
Just like you lied
at our original trial.

23:09.925 --> 23:11.355
Tell me something,
why do you keep lying

23:11.379 --> 23:13.689
- against the Scott family?
- Objection, Your Honor.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.855
Withdrawn. I think we know
where this witness stands

23:15.892 --> 23:17.183
on the truth.

23:19.644 --> 23:21.435
Nothing further.

23:25.717 --> 23:28.536
- Levi. What, no "thank you"?
- Thank you.

23:28.696 --> 23:30.474
What... Come on.

23:30.511 --> 23:32.552
While your lawyer
was organizing papers,

23:32.589 --> 23:34.900
I proved that Heather was lying.
I probably saved your ass

23:34.937 --> 23:36.904
25 years in prison.

23:37.738 --> 23:39.121
Why are you laughing?

23:39.239 --> 23:41.123
You don't see it, do you?

23:41.886 --> 23:43.189
You think that you're there for me,

23:43.213 --> 23:44.420
but really, you just show up

23:44.457 --> 23:45.617
when you want to be the hero.

23:45.660 --> 23:46.927
- I do not.
- Okay, fine. Well,

23:46.964 --> 23:48.377
then you believe
what you want to believe,

23:48.401 --> 23:49.865
but I don't need you saving me anymore.

23:49.889 --> 23:51.030
I'm fine on my own.

23:56.988 --> 23:59.171
You weren't so easy to
find, Ms. Curtis.

23:59.283 --> 24:00.537
Why do I need to be found?

24:00.574 --> 24:02.314
I said what I saw in court.

24:02.409 --> 24:04.448
Well, no one said where you lived.

24:05.041 --> 24:06.355
Is this the window

24:06.392 --> 24:08.791
you said you saw the
Davon Watkins shooting from?

24:08.867 --> 24:10.198
Yeah.

24:13.273 --> 24:15.491
You see the woman on that bench?

24:16.330 --> 24:18.827
Can you tell
if she's wearing glasses or not?

24:19.205 --> 24:21.238
- No.
- Yeah, me, neither.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.400
What about that blue car?
Can you tell if the driver

24:23.437 --> 24:25.246
is a man or a woman?

24:27.088 --> 24:28.385
I don't really...

24:28.422 --> 24:29.859
Nancy.

24:30.457 --> 24:32.744
Why did you testify that Davon
was the shooter?

24:32.807 --> 24:35.344
You can't possibly have seen him
from that far away.

24:35.916 --> 24:37.754
I know what I saw.

24:38.104 --> 24:40.830
- You all can leave now.
- We're not trying to upset you.

24:41.143 --> 24:43.466
We're just trying to save
an innocent life.

24:43.722 --> 24:46.490
Yeah? So am I.

24:47.931 --> 24:49.612
Did someone threaten you?

24:49.778 --> 24:51.504
Threaten your son?

24:53.147 --> 24:55.977
Nancy, do you know
who the real shooter was?

24:56.744 --> 24:57.824
You think I'm a damn fool?

24:57.861 --> 24:59.096
That's how you get yourself killed.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.150
We're not gonna tell nobody
what you say to us.

25:03.638 --> 25:07.023
Look, I'm not testifying to
nothing, that's for damn sure.

25:07.283 --> 25:09.712
But that cop-...
he was playing with fire.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.698
Everybody knew when he got burnt,

25:11.735 --> 25:12.758
it was gonna blow back on all of us,

25:12.782 --> 25:13.871
and it sure enough did.

25:13.908 --> 25:15.534
Wait, are you saying that

25:15.571 --> 25:17.621
everyone knew that Sampson was a cop,

25:17.658 --> 25:19.469
even before the shooting?

25:19.624 --> 25:22.002
Everybody knows everything
in this neighborhood.

25:22.073 --> 25:24.986
Just ain't nobody gonna say
what that everything is.

25:28.709 --> 25:31.785
This was no accidental
shooting of a cop.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.965
No. It was a hit.

25:37.143 --> 25:38.910
So you're saying it wasn't
a stray bullet

25:38.947 --> 25:40.112
that killed that cop?

25:40.149 --> 25:42.236
This is good news, Davon.

25:42.463 --> 25:44.505
Maybe now they can
find the real killer.

25:44.623 --> 25:46.340
Nah, I don't know, Gram.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.590
I figure at least, if it was a kid,

25:49.221 --> 25:50.713
then it was an accident.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.893
Somebody would talk.

25:51.930 --> 25:53.192
But this... a hit?

25:53.229 --> 25:54.671
Nah, everybody hushed.

25:55.353 --> 25:56.756
I'm-a die in here for this one.

25:56.830 --> 25:58.185
Davon?

25:58.455 --> 26:01.654
I can't imagine what
it's like to be on death row.

26:01.971 --> 26:04.433
But I know what it's like
to have no hope.

26:04.658 --> 26:06.731
I was eight years in,
nothing but prison bars

26:06.768 --> 26:08.291
and violence ahead of me.

26:08.729 --> 26:10.619
All I had was my truth,

26:10.930 --> 26:13.747
I didn't do this.

26:18.293 --> 26:20.477
You know what kept me going
all this time?

26:21.846 --> 26:24.027
Thinking about the life
that I could've had.

26:24.432 --> 26:25.954
You know.

26:26.073 --> 26:29.291
Me and my girl, we'd have some kids,

26:29.556 --> 26:31.848
get the hell up out of East C.

26:34.158 --> 26:36.432
But that's not my reality.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.643
Do you know anyone
that we can look at for this?

26:39.760 --> 26:42.432
You asking me if I know anybody
in East Cleveland

26:42.494 --> 26:44.309
that'd want to kill a cop?

26:45.306 --> 26:46.631
Everybody.

26:46.885 --> 26:49.275
I got 97 whole days left.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.405
I could have a thousand more...

26:52.008 --> 26:54.225
and still, nobody's gonna talk.

26:54.335 --> 26:56.219
Well, I'm still gonna try.

26:57.666 --> 26:59.129
I heard Madeline Scott

26:59.166 --> 27:01.415
annihilated your star witness on cross.

27:02.727 --> 27:04.683
Does Bellows know I got
my ass handed to me?

27:04.720 --> 27:07.168
Not yet. But I think there's a
way we can manage the situation

27:07.205 --> 27:08.448
and both come out winners.

27:08.485 --> 27:09.882
I'm not giving up.

27:09.958 --> 27:11.791
You should offer a simple assault plea,

27:11.900 --> 27:13.502
Class C misdemeanor.

27:13.650 --> 27:15.078
A slap on the wrist?

27:15.158 --> 27:17.301
No way, I can do better than that.

27:17.338 --> 27:19.508
You can, but you won't.

27:20.158 --> 27:21.832
Offer a deal that sends Levi Scott

27:21.869 --> 27:23.218
to anger management counseling.

27:23.286 --> 27:24.720
I'll do the rest.

27:25.465 --> 27:27.174
And how does this help me?

27:27.463 --> 27:29.393
You'll be second chair
when we re-prosecute

27:29.430 --> 27:32.279
Madeline and Levi Scott for
the murder of Rosemary Lynch.

27:43.518 --> 27:47.035
Neighborhood like this only
exists in survival mode.

27:47.268 --> 27:50.856
Violence happens for whatever
reasons it happens,

27:50.932 --> 27:52.791
but nobody sees anything.

27:53.002 --> 27:55.002
So it'll never be safe.

27:55.463 --> 27:58.139
Police is supposed
to make this place safe.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.408
The rest of these folks
are just trying to stay alive.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.926
No one snitches,
no one helps the police,

28:03.963 --> 28:05.785
so the police don't come,
don't do anything

28:05.822 --> 28:07.688
and the cycle of violence continues?

28:07.725 --> 28:09.695
Yeah, something like that.

28:10.619 --> 28:13.101
It gets depressing if you think
about it too hard.

28:13.204 --> 28:15.704
But that's why I'm fighting
to change all that.

28:17.369 --> 28:19.298
If Sampson, the undercover cop,

28:19.335 --> 28:21.963
wasn't undercover, that puts
a huge target on his back.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.324
Well, only a few folks
can shoot at that target

28:24.361 --> 28:25.596
and get away with it.

28:25.643 --> 28:27.293
You mean someone
who instills enough fear

28:27.330 --> 28:29.111
that no one snitches.

28:30.096 --> 28:31.697
So who are we talking about?

28:32.922 --> 28:35.455
I don't know all those
old neighborhood players.

28:37.537 --> 28:39.305
But I can tell you who does.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.771
Look, we know it was a hit.

28:43.909 --> 28:45.793
It's just a matter of who did it.

28:46.090 --> 28:48.066
Or who could get away with it.

28:49.068 --> 28:51.077
Look, man, I don't know nothing.

28:52.017 --> 28:54.017
You're scared.

28:56.963 --> 28:58.898
Why are you scared?

28:59.058 --> 29:01.991
Because gangbangers
don't like questions.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.224
But it was 15 years ago.

29:06.166 --> 29:08.218
Whoever did this is still around.

29:08.470 --> 29:10.620
And that's why nobody's talking.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.719
Ray, you got family

29:15.096 --> 29:16.403
outside of East Cleveland?

29:16.440 --> 29:17.985
Somewhere you can go?

29:18.853 --> 29:20.611
Tell us what we need to know.

29:20.997 --> 29:22.997
We'll help you get out.

29:23.861 --> 29:25.611
You feel trapped.

29:26.051 --> 29:28.196
We know what that feels like.

29:29.464 --> 29:31.767
Imagine how scared Davon is,

29:32.178 --> 29:34.095
waiting to die.

29:36.104 --> 29:38.420
Hey, y'all got to understand, man.

29:38.604 --> 29:40.510
I mean, there's
so much information out there

29:40.547 --> 29:41.838
that people know,

29:41.875 --> 29:43.708
but the streets just ain't talking.

29:46.948 --> 29:49.023
It's Troy D's world, baby.

29:49.367 --> 29:51.718
The rest of us just trying
to live in it, you know?

29:52.559 --> 29:55.501
Been this way 20-some-odd years now.

29:55.624 --> 29:58.736
I mean, Troy found out
the man was undercover.

29:59.956 --> 30:01.963
Felt like he needed to take him out.

30:02.352 --> 30:04.202
Troy D.

30:05.049 --> 30:06.264
He's the shooter?

30:06.301 --> 30:07.679
Nah.

30:07.913 --> 30:09.830
Troy D's too smart for that.

30:09.979 --> 30:12.280
Someone does his dirty work.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.768
Omar Blackwell.

30:20.338 --> 30:21.889
Thank you.

30:22.119 --> 30:23.891
Hey, listen.

30:23.985 --> 30:25.963
Maybe I'll take you up on that offer.

30:26.119 --> 30:28.096
You know,
to help me get down to my sister

30:28.147 --> 30:29.322
in Lexington.

30:29.426 --> 30:31.176
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

30:31.326 --> 30:32.825
How do we find Omar?

30:32.862 --> 30:34.520
That's easy. Omar's in prison.

30:34.557 --> 30:37.449
- Where?
- Down at Southie.

30:37.971 --> 30:39.662
On death row.

31:00.780 --> 31:02.669
You a pretty thing, ain't you?

31:02.706 --> 31:05.022
I'm Davon Watkins' attorney.

31:05.752 --> 31:09.210
He's on death row for the murder
of Officer Steve Sampson.

31:10.890 --> 31:13.324
I thought that name would ring a bell.

31:13.896 --> 31:15.451
We have all the proof we need

31:15.488 --> 31:17.980
that you murdered
Officer Sampson, not Davon.

31:18.206 --> 31:20.593
If that was true,
you wouldn't be sitting here.

31:21.466 --> 31:24.177
So let's cut it up
and tell me what y'all want.

31:24.379 --> 31:25.826
All right.

31:26.235 --> 31:27.285
Admit to the shooting

31:27.321 --> 31:29.705
so Davon doesn't die for what you did.

31:29.909 --> 31:31.221
You've exhausted all your appeals.

31:31.245 --> 31:33.011
What have you got to lose?

31:35.673 --> 31:39.146
You make a request of me,
I make one to you.

31:40.891 --> 31:42.740
We see what comes of it, yeah?

31:43.794 --> 31:45.623
Depends on the request.

31:46.146 --> 31:47.808
I got a son.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.987
His mama told him I'm dead.

31:52.815 --> 31:55.083
Maybe, but not just yet.

31:55.383 --> 31:57.208
You bring him here

31:57.245 --> 31:59.599
so I can set eyes on him...

32:00.317 --> 32:01.978
and we in business.

32:06.421 --> 32:08.311
I don't understand what I'm looking at.

32:08.423 --> 32:10.600
They're slides from Rosemary's autopsy.

32:10.827 --> 32:12.741
Your prosecutor, Gore Bellows-...

32:12.847 --> 32:15.084
his theory was that you
and your brother

32:15.121 --> 32:17.135
used a rock to kill Rosemary.

32:17.397 --> 32:19.147
These slides clearly indicate

32:19.184 --> 32:20.444
that the blunt force object

32:20.481 --> 32:22.853
used to kill Rosemary was not a rock.

32:23.612 --> 32:25.019
Bellows was wrong.

32:25.056 --> 32:26.475
How did you see that?

32:26.537 --> 32:29.334
Medical professionals I use
in my reinsurance practice-...

32:29.371 --> 32:31.475
they said it was obviously some kind

32:31.512 --> 32:33.196
of rusty pipe or metal object.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.959
- What does this mean?
- It means

32:34.996 --> 32:36.355
I think we have a shot of getting you

32:36.379 --> 32:38.201
and your brother out of prison.

32:44.198 --> 32:47.199
And I ain't seen you
since you was in diapers.

32:47.932 --> 32:49.666
They told me you were dead.

32:50.311 --> 32:52.189
That ain't really a lie, I guess.

32:53.194 --> 32:55.301
You're in here for killing a man.

32:55.545 --> 32:58.471
And now another man is going
to lose his life because of you.

32:58.589 --> 32:59.880
You hear that?

32:59.917 --> 33:02.060
He cares more about Davon
than he does his old man.

33:02.097 --> 33:03.959
Well, Davon never killed anyone.

33:05.162 --> 33:06.631
You did.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.358
She tells me you're a doctor.

33:15.131 --> 33:18.161
Every man in our family
been behind bars.

33:19.494 --> 33:21.741
It's time one of us stay free.

33:24.159 --> 33:27.006
Banging, dealing.

33:27.389 --> 33:30.850
You chose that life over your family.

33:32.865 --> 33:34.491
Was it worth it?

33:38.901 --> 33:40.817
That's what I thought.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.155
Goodbye, Omar.

33:50.969 --> 33:53.548
Goodbye, son.

34:00.518 --> 34:02.810
If I admit to killing that cop,

34:03.499 --> 34:05.474
they gonna let Davon out?

34:06.409 --> 34:08.909
If you testify, yes.

34:09.621 --> 34:11.164
Okay.

34:14.591 --> 34:16.674
I'll tell the truth.

34:22.129 --> 34:23.991
Coffee's better at AA.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.366
Or is it Bible study?

34:26.452 --> 34:28.616
Just stay away
from that sacramental wine.

34:28.670 --> 34:31.694
That's the best part of mass.

34:31.795 --> 34:33.357
What's your deal?

34:34.319 --> 34:36.101
What-what do you mean,
"What's my deal?"

34:36.139 --> 34:39.116
It's anger management,
not speed dating.

34:40.686 --> 34:43.694
Well, this coffee sucks,

34:44.018 --> 34:46.362
so now I want to kill someone.

34:47.279 --> 34:49.647
I'm kidding. I didn't...
I don't really want to...

34:51.616 --> 34:54.754
I don't-I don't...
I don't know what my deal is.

34:54.791 --> 34:56.911
Self-discovery type.

34:57.107 --> 34:59.827
If this was speed dating,
I'd be into it.

35:12.631 --> 35:13.922
Hey, do you mind?

35:13.983 --> 35:15.452
Not at all.

35:34.373 --> 35:35.819
Wait here.

35:38.033 --> 35:39.467
Big O!

35:40.793 --> 35:42.192
Big O.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.818
Omar.

35:46.982 --> 35:48.404
I know you, bruh?

35:49.477 --> 35:52.478
Hey, you know, I had to come say
something to the legend, man.

35:52.515 --> 35:53.640
You need a smoke?

35:55.750 --> 35:57.466
- Thanks, blood.
- Yeah, man.

35:58.350 --> 36:00.067
Well, you know, man...

36:00.201 --> 36:02.724
it's a real shame when a legend dies.

36:03.590 --> 36:07.289
I ain't dead yet.

36:12.138 --> 36:13.561
You know we got ears everywhere,

36:13.598 --> 36:15.395
you little punk-ass rat.

36:27.889 --> 36:29.831
They know who killed Omar?

36:30.069 --> 36:31.514
Not yet.

36:31.647 --> 36:34.670
All right, how bad is it?
The case, I mean, without Omar?

36:34.709 --> 36:36.414
Well, we have his sworn affidavit.

36:36.476 --> 36:37.647
We'll get that admitted.

36:37.684 --> 36:39.108
But, to be honest,

36:39.315 --> 36:41.952
without Omar, it could be a long shot.

36:42.336 --> 36:44.217
The judge might not let it in.

36:45.049 --> 36:48.800
I spent 4,710 days in solitary.

36:49.146 --> 36:50.646
I'll take a long shot.

36:51.063 --> 36:52.870
Can I steal you for a minute?

36:53.577 --> 36:55.585
Um, yeah, I, um...

36:56.670 --> 36:58.425
I have to get to this staff
meeting for the campaign.

36:58.449 --> 36:59.561
It'll just be a second.

36:59.598 --> 37:01.331
It's a new development,
may help with the campaign.

37:01.355 --> 37:03.523
- Okay.
- It's about Levi Scott.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.134
You know that Levi took a plea.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.918
Community service
and anger management classes.

37:07.942 --> 37:08.834
I do.

37:08.871 --> 37:10.363
Well, the support group
he's been attending

37:10.387 --> 37:12.537
is pretty much one big
confidential therapy session.

37:12.608 --> 37:14.441
I think Levi will spill
some things that'll help,

37:14.465 --> 37:16.345
- if you need it.
- And you can get him to talk?

37:16.454 --> 37:19.381
About Madeline and
Rosemary Lynch? Of course.

37:19.444 --> 37:20.991
You know, I put him on the stand.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.285
Once he opens his mouth,

37:22.322 --> 37:23.842
he can't help but incriminate himself.

37:23.894 --> 37:25.108
My thoughts exactly.

37:25.179 --> 37:26.971
Unlike that sister of his.

37:27.008 --> 37:28.433
Listen, I got to get to this meeting.

37:28.457 --> 37:30.253
Why don't you come along, Isabel?

37:30.358 --> 37:31.733
There's room for me on the train?

37:31.770 --> 37:32.991
You kidding?

37:33.028 --> 37:34.987
There's always room
for you on the train.

37:35.241 --> 37:37.846
Your Honor,
we have filed a motion for a new trial

37:37.914 --> 37:40.989
supported by a sworn affidavit
signed by Omar Blackwell,

37:41.059 --> 37:43.405
who states that he's the one
who killed Detective Sampson.

37:43.506 --> 37:45.744
We'll put this case on for a hearing

37:45.781 --> 37:47.248
and Mr. Blackwell can come in

37:47.285 --> 37:49.644
and testify to the contents
of his affidavit.

37:49.802 --> 37:51.307
He's at the morgue, Your Honor.

37:52.185 --> 37:54.352
He was shanked yesterday
for confessing.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.530
In light of his sworn affidavit,

37:56.567 --> 37:58.359
and pursuant to
Chambers v. Mississippi,

37:58.396 --> 37:59.711
we move for a new trial.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.168
This is a statement against interest,

38:01.192 --> 38:04.085
it clearly exposes Mr. Blackwell
to criminal liability.

38:04.122 --> 38:06.897
That is not enough to satisfy
your burden of proof, Ms. Scott.

38:06.934 --> 38:08.094
- Your Honor...
- Furthermore,

38:08.121 --> 38:10.670
Omar Blackwell was already
facing a death sentence.

38:10.707 --> 38:12.348
- What's one more?
- Your Honor,

38:12.410 --> 38:14.560
you have a signed confession
in your hand.

38:14.780 --> 38:16.600
Davon Watkins was denied

38:16.637 --> 38:19.062
his freedom for being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

38:19.367 --> 38:21.183
He's been mistreated
by the justice system

38:21.220 --> 38:22.869
and he's going to die because of it.

38:23.717 --> 38:25.157
Yeah, the rest of us have the luxury

38:25.186 --> 38:26.405
of going home tonight and not

38:26.442 --> 38:28.456
counting down the days until we die.

38:29.133 --> 38:32.301
Davon Watkins? He's counting.

38:32.495 --> 38:34.819
And that number gets shorter every day.

38:35.954 --> 38:39.803
So, please, with everything
that has been presented to you,

38:40.339 --> 38:42.522
do you not have even
the slightest doubt?

38:42.577 --> 38:45.070
Your client was convicted by a jury.

38:45.678 --> 38:48.988
Their verdict was upheld
on appeal six times.

38:50.056 --> 38:52.006
Finality is a fundamental value

38:52.043 --> 38:53.826
of the criminal justice system,
Ms. Scott.

38:53.863 --> 38:56.081
So is innocence, Your Honor.

39:02.685 --> 39:04.640
All right, Ms. Scott.

39:06.130 --> 39:07.897
I will grant Davon Watkins

39:07.934 --> 39:09.350
a stay of execution

39:09.387 --> 39:10.961
so that you may have enough time

39:10.998 --> 39:13.272
to gather evidence
to establish the credibility

39:13.309 --> 39:15.192
of Mr. Blackwell's confession.

39:15.674 --> 39:17.907
Let's re-calendar for six months.

39:24.097 --> 39:25.288
Imagine

39:25.325 --> 39:27.495
that you are in a boxing ring.

39:27.928 --> 39:31.889
Your opponent is the
U.S. criminal justice system.

39:32.373 --> 39:34.553
Now imagine that match

39:34.590 --> 39:36.290
lasting 20 years

39:36.327 --> 39:38.499
because that's how long it takes

39:38.631 --> 39:42.374
for a death row inmate
to exhaust all of their appeals.

39:42.639 --> 39:45.366
Each appeal is like another round.

39:45.631 --> 39:48.505
It's another chance at freedom.

39:48.725 --> 39:50.618
But it's also a reminder

39:50.655 --> 39:53.905
that you are running out of chances

39:54.104 --> 39:55.729
and time.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.580
A-a stay of execution-...

39:59.617 --> 40:01.216
what-what does that mean, really?

40:01.373 --> 40:03.748
It means your execution's
been deferred.

40:04.045 --> 40:05.816
We didn't get you out just yet,

40:05.900 --> 40:08.358
but keeping you alive means we can.

40:08.561 --> 40:10.867
I know it's not what
you wanted to hear,

40:10.984 --> 40:12.953
but it does buy us time to find

40:12.990 --> 40:15.420
some good Ohio lawyers
and investigators

40:15.457 --> 40:17.827
so we can build a case against Troy D.

40:17.975 --> 40:19.951
And we'll keep tabs on you, Davon.

40:20.092 --> 40:21.921
All right, if you need anything,

40:21.958 --> 40:24.024
we're just a phone call away.

40:24.795 --> 40:26.242
Thank you.

40:28.616 --> 40:32.561
For real... thank you.

40:39.670 --> 40:42.659
We saved an innocent man's life today,

40:43.523 --> 40:46.395
but Davon is still in prison.

40:46.524 --> 40:48.928
Do the right thing! Free Davon!

40:48.965 --> 40:50.631
Do the right thing!

40:50.668 --> 40:52.616
Free Davon! Do the right thing!

40:52.678 --> 40:54.952
So we don't stop fighting.

40:55.030 --> 40:57.709
We make phone calls to the
Ohio governor's office,

40:57.775 --> 41:00.787
file a clemency application
with the Ohio Parole Board,

41:00.842 --> 41:04.405
because Davon's life, his freedom,

41:04.442 --> 41:06.350
are in our hands.

41:06.387 --> 41:08.444
All of our hands.

41:17.097 --> 41:18.937
It takes them two
seconds to lock someone up,

41:18.973 --> 41:21.191
but an eternity to admit they're wrong.

41:21.327 --> 41:23.404
Stay of execution is a good thing.

41:23.944 --> 41:26.561
Davon should've been exonerated.
He should be going home.

41:26.686 --> 41:28.491
That doesn't mean he won't be,
eventually.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.936
You gave him hope, Maddie.

41:31.044 --> 41:32.848
That is a powerful thing.

41:36.314 --> 41:38.678
Levi says I have a hero complex.

41:38.907 --> 41:41.327
That unless I'm saving someone,
mainly him,

41:41.364 --> 41:43.672
- I don't feel right.
- Sounds accurate.

41:43.709 --> 41:45.395
- Yes, absolutely true.
- Yeah, I agree.

41:45.483 --> 41:48.456
But that's not a bad thing.

41:49.912 --> 41:51.459
Got to get home.

41:51.782 --> 41:53.936
I actually have a date tonight.

41:54.530 --> 41:55.946
You do?

41:55.983 --> 41:57.254
I got sword class.

41:57.291 --> 41:59.182
Talk about a hero complex.

41:59.238 --> 42:01.722
Of course he has sword class.

42:03.497 --> 42:05.888
My hero.

42:15.795 --> 42:17.262
We got a court date.

42:18.822 --> 42:22.191
My lawyer thinks that he can
prove that we're innocent,

42:22.325 --> 42:25.518
or at least vacate our convictions.

42:26.728 --> 42:29.588
This time next week,
I could be going home.

42:38.277 --> 42:40.381
I'm so sorry, baby.

42:41.196 --> 42:42.637
I don't want to leave you.

42:42.702 --> 42:44.644
I don't know how I could.

42:47.478 --> 42:50.944
You're the only person
who's ever made me feel safe.

42:51.867 --> 42:53.524
Please don't be sad.

42:53.889 --> 42:55.401
I'm not sad, dummy.

42:57.803 --> 42:59.511
These are tears of joy.

43:12.889 --> 43:16.241
