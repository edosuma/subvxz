08:44.457 --> 08:45.892
Hi, Carson!

08:45.992 --> 08:48.027
Hi, everybody.
Hi, angels.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.129
- Come on, darling.
- Okay.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.398
All right, Spice,
come on over.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.000
50% less Sugar.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.135
Yeah!
[laughs]

08:56.235 --> 08:57.336
Everyone's doing it.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.138
So let's talk design.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.840
Well, basically
I'm all about the purse.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.109
I love an outfit that kind of
revolves around a purse.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.243
- Yes, of course.
- Mm-hmm.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.645
So I saw this,
and I was like, ooh!

09:05.745 --> 09:07.713
Kind of like a disco night
almost, like--

09:07.813 --> 09:09.749
If you come out
just holding a disco ball,

09:09.849 --> 09:12.018
like, Christmas tree ornament
as a bag,

09:12.118 --> 09:13.719
not gonna cut it.

09:13.819 --> 09:17.189
A lot of the silhouettes
that you have come here with

09:17.290 --> 09:18.257
are very similar.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.626
So this being
a design challenge

09:20.726 --> 09:23.629
is an opportunity
to maybe switch it up.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.664
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:24.764 --> 09:25.898
We all know you're gorgeous,

09:25.998 --> 09:28.901
but some of your looks
have lacked personality.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.369
We know that you have it.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.737

storytelling moment.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.406
Who is Spice?

09:33.506 --> 09:34.607
Give us a little bit extra.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.576
After hearing
Carson's critiques,

09:36.676 --> 09:37.843
we have to make this more.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.812
And by more, I'm just
assuming more fabric.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.181
The last design challenge,
I was safe,

09:42.281 --> 09:43.816
so I'm excited for this one.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.618
I'm like, we're gonna
up the ante.

09:45.718 --> 09:46.886
I may not know how to sew,

09:46.986 --> 09:49.188
but I can give you
a longer skirt.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.123
You know, I might still have
a split up to the cooch,

09:51.223 --> 09:54.727
but it's still gonna be
more fabric, so...

09:54.827 --> 09:56.729
All right, Mistress!

09:56.829 --> 09:59.799
Are you learning how to work
that sewing machine?

09:59.899 --> 10:01.300
Actually,
quite the opposite, love.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.735

10:05.972 --> 10:07.206

10:07.306 --> 10:09.108
Ciao, this saucy bitch.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.877
Oh, you've done a board.
A board!

10:11.978 --> 10:14.680
I want to really just go
full glam, like, full pageant,

10:14.780 --> 10:16.015
- Texas tease.
- Mm-hmm.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.084
I know a lot of other girls
are doing gowns,

10:18.184 --> 10:21.420
but some things are looking
very gluttonous and gaudy.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.423
So I want to make sure
that I'm utilizing

10:24.523 --> 10:26.158
the embellishments
and kind of using them

10:26.258 --> 10:27.326
to still shape my body.

10:27.426 --> 10:28.761
Sure, okay.

10:28.861 --> 10:30.529
I think that most
of the time, the big girls

10:30.630 --> 10:32.598
aren't necessarily known
for their fashion,

10:32.698 --> 10:35.067
so I'm hoping to shake
things up this go-round.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.037
So now, you've revealed
your big personality.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.140
How did the other girls
react to that?

10:41.240 --> 10:42.975
I think that
the other girls could be

10:43.075 --> 10:44.443
intimidated by it at times.

10:44.543 --> 10:46.846
I might come off
a little aggressive

10:46.946 --> 10:48.848
because at the end of the day,
I'm here to win.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.883
I think that at times,
the girls

10:50.983 --> 10:52.318
think I'm playing games.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.820
But one thing they can't deny
is that I keep it real.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.455
That's right.
All right, kiddo.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.391
I can't wait to see
what you do on the runway.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.626
- Knock 'em dead.
- Thank you.

everything over here!

11:04.497 --> 11:05.598
Oh, good. Yeah.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.033
So what do you have there?

11:07.133 --> 11:09.235
I'm giving very, like,
beautiful evening gown,

11:09.335 --> 11:10.603
like, red carpet moment.

11:10.703 --> 11:11.971
- Ooh.
- Okay.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.706
This is, like, the base,
and I was thinking

11:13.806 --> 11:16.509
of using this pretty lace
to go over it.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.977
So I was gonna
layer this on top

11:18.077 --> 11:19.845
to give a nude illusion
and this, like, sparkly.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.480
But I have all this trim.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.416
So I was gonna maybe
use this to, like,

11:23.516 --> 11:24.917
do the trim
and, like, the slit.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.619
There's a slit down the leg.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.055
Well, I'm hearing
a lot of stuff.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.056
- Yeah.
- I'm hearing a lot of stuff.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.190
- Okay, yes.
- And--

11:31.290 --> 11:32.224
This is pretty busy.

11:32.324 --> 11:33.459
Then you have that tape.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.695
And then you have
this nude illusion burnout.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.196
That's three very busy things.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.297
Got it.

11:38.397 --> 11:39.832
So if style is not
maybe your forte,

11:39.932 --> 11:42.401
keep it simple,
but make it amazing.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.071
And make sure you
sell it on the runway.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.505

emotionally?

11:56.649 --> 11:57.950

very confident,

11:59.518 --> 12:01.020
knowing exactly who I was.

of drag here, I was like,

it's the 15th anniversary

16:52.544 --> 16:54.213
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

16:54.313 --> 16:56.582
There have been
some crazy moments

16:56.682 --> 16:58.684
on this show that are iconic.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.153
I quote it all the time,

17:01.253 --> 17:03.389
the fight between Shangela
and Mimi Imfurst.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.656
I don't have
a sugar daddy.

17:04.757 --> 17:05.924
I've never had
a sugar daddy.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.159
If I wanted
a sugar daddy, yes,

17:07.259 --> 17:08.193
I probably could
go out and get one

17:08.293 --> 17:10.095
because I am what?
Sickening!

17:10.195 --> 17:12.097
- You bitch!
- Oh!

17:12.197 --> 17:13.098
[laughs]

17:13.198 --> 17:14.800
Alyssa Edwards in general

17:14.900 --> 17:16.568
- just doing anything.
- Anything.

17:16.668 --> 17:18.871
I do a really good
Alyssa Edwards.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.139
Coco, you're gonna have put
a little more pink

17:20.239 --> 17:21.540
up in that eye.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.609
both: Girl, look how orange
you fucking look, girl.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.711
Ooh!
[laughs]

17:25.811 --> 17:27.179
Bianca as Judge Judy
was pretty iconic.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.947
Oh, that was--
baloney!

17:29.048 --> 17:30.649
That is correct,
Judge Judy.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.418
Not a match,
Your Honor.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.652
Baloney!

17:33.752 --> 17:34.887
I love...

17:34.987 --> 17:36.588
both: Opulence!

17:36.688 --> 17:39.825
You own everything!

17:39.925 --> 17:42.661
One of my favorite moments
was Ongina being so vulnerable

17:42.761 --> 17:44.930
- and coming out as HIV positive.
- Oh, my God, yeah.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.565
I've been living
with HIV

17:46.665 --> 17:48.367
for the last two years
of my life,

17:48.467 --> 17:50.869
and this means
so much to me!

17:50.969 --> 17:54.106
[crying]
Oh, my God!

17:54.206 --> 17:56.341
Ongina,
you're an inspiration.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.910
Thank you.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.511
It was just an amazing moment
for the show

17:59.611 --> 18:02.181
and, like,
for gay culture, period.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.184
I'm sorry, Rebecca Glasscock
walking in in jeans

18:05.284 --> 18:06.652
paved the way for me and Sugar

18:06.752 --> 18:08.654
walking in
with our little miniskirts.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.690
Rebecca Glasscock walked
so y'all could--

18:11.790 --> 18:12.758
what do you do?

18:12.858 --> 18:14.560
She walked so we could trot!

21:01.893 --> 21:04.329
of RuPaul's famous

21:22.147 --> 21:23.515
I'm trying not to trot,

21:23.615 --> 21:25.250
'cause I know Michelle
doesn't want me to do it.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.619
But of course, I turn
my little flag, and it says,

21:27.719 --> 21:29.588
"Ding-a-ling,"
because the boys

21:29.688 --> 21:31.957
want to know

21:32.057 --> 21:34.026

21:34.126 --> 21:35.460
I chose to interpret

21:35.560 --> 21:38.130
the RuPaul
iconic pink racer look

21:38.230 --> 21:40.766
as, like,

Princess Peach,

22:26.044 --> 22:27.713

Oh, my God!

25:47.112 --> 25:50.715
Oh, look at the size
of those jewels!

25:50.815 --> 25:52.584
- And by jewels, I mean her tits.
- Yeah.

25:52.684 --> 25:53.985
[laughter]

25:54.085 --> 25:55.387
I have the beautiful
beaded French crystals

25:55.487 --> 25:56.922
on my shoulders.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.391
As I raise my arms, I know
the light is radiating off

25:59.491 --> 26:01.459
of them, as well as
the crystallized trim

26:01.560 --> 26:03.194
on the bottom
that's just holding down

26:03.295 --> 26:04.629
the perfect length.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.064
She's not a whore.

26:06.164 --> 26:07.732
- What is she?
- She's an expensive whore.

26:07.832 --> 26:10.035
- Oh.
- Spice.

26:10.135 --> 26:13.271
Takes a lot of disco balls
to wear an outfit like this.

26:13.371 --> 26:16.608
My top is fully
disco ball realness.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.510
Of course,
I want to trot so bad.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.579
But I'm trying to be
a little bit more model-esque,

26:20.679 --> 26:22.714
a little bit more
calm and subdued.

26:22.814 --> 26:23.982
She's a baller.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.917
She certainly is.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.819
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.523
Let them eat cake!
Let them eat all of this cake!

26:31.623 --> 26:34.859
Head to toe, I am
decked out in my crystals.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.496
On my panty,
I have my brooch vaginta.

26:38.597 --> 26:42.767
I'm looking like
a dreamy old stripper.

26:42.867 --> 26:44.536
Yes, you cancan!

26:44.636 --> 26:45.537

Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

26:48.039 --> 26:49.274
- You heard of Redd Foxx?
- Yeah.

26:49.374 --> 26:50.475
This is Pink Foxx.

26:50.575 --> 26:52.043
[laughter]

26:52.143 --> 26:53.945
I am dripping in crystals

26:54.045 --> 26:57.315
'cause anything that blings,
it's my thing.

26:57.415 --> 27:00.018
Beaded for her pleasure.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.388
Salina EsTitties, hail satin!

27:03.488 --> 27:04.823
[laughter]

27:04.923 --> 27:06.791
EsTitties was driving
down the PCH.

27:06.891 --> 27:07.993
She took in the sights
of the palm trees.

27:08.093 --> 27:09.594
Now she is at the Emmys.

27:09.694 --> 27:11.830
It's very simple,
my lines are gorgeous,

27:11.930 --> 27:13.365
and I look really pretty.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.166
Crystals are
a queen's best friend.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.635
Yes.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.036
Loosey LaDuca.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.371
Hey, Loosey!

27:19.471 --> 27:21.106
Losing is the new winning.

27:21.206 --> 27:22.674
[laughter]

27:22.774 --> 27:25.076
For this runway, I wanted
to go with the concept

27:25.176 --> 27:29.047
of a small-town girl who's won
all of her local pageants,

27:29.147 --> 27:32.450
but this time,
she didn't get the gold.

27:32.550 --> 27:36.021
Miss Garlic 1987 is my title.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.455
And honestly,
I'm getting flashbacks

27:37.555 --> 27:38.823
to episode one, okay,

27:38.923 --> 27:40.525
and I'm not enjoying it!

27:40.625 --> 27:42.460
Hey, Loosey,
your ass is mint.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.262
[laughter]

27:44.362 --> 27:46.631
Luxx Noir London.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.433
Ice, ice, baby.

27:48.533 --> 27:51.736
My runway look is kind of
like one of those,

27:51.836 --> 27:53.538
like, Swarovski trinkets.

27:53.638 --> 27:56.641
It's so delicate
and so impractical,

27:56.741 --> 27:59.811
but fashion is not meant
to be practical.

27:59.911 --> 28:01.646
I'm wearing a piece of art.

28:01.746 --> 28:03.048
Come on, Sugarplum Fairy.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.049
[laughter]

28:04.149 --> 28:05.517
Sasha Colby.

28:05.617 --> 28:08.119
- Mm.
- Hawaii 5-Ho!

28:08.219 --> 28:09.320
[laughter]

28:09.421 --> 28:10.889
For my
Crystallized Eleganza look,

28:10.989 --> 28:14.192
I am giving you
golden coral goddess

28:14.292 --> 28:17.929
emerging
from the lava of Hawaii.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.965
I own 51% of this tree!

28:21.066 --> 28:23.034
[laughter]

28:23.134 --> 28:24.436
Anetra.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.905
- Ooh!
- Hello, Met Gala.

28:27.005 --> 28:28.707
I thought this dress
was extinct.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.608
[laughter]

28:30.709 --> 28:33.511
I've got a full-blown
crystallized spine

28:33.611 --> 28:35.213
coming out of this gown!

28:35.313 --> 28:36.414
It looks dangerous.

28:36.514 --> 28:37.716
It looks like
it might hurt you.

28:37.816 --> 28:40.418
But don't worry,
it's actually very, very--

28:40.518 --> 28:42.620
I'm lying.
It's very painful.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.989
It's worth it, because
it's so goddamn beautiful.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.093
She's a "triceratop,"
or so I've heard.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.295
[laughter]

28:51.996 --> 28:53.465
Welcome, queens.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.466
I've made some decisions.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.990
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.760
Up first, Salina EsTitties.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.462
The first look,
Start Your Engines, was fun.

29:24.562 --> 29:26.798
You were wearing it,
and that's really important.

29:26.898 --> 29:29.634
And then Money Ball,
what a great idea.

29:29.734 --> 29:31.836
- Whoever is on those notes--
- It's her.

29:31.936 --> 29:32.871
Oh, is that you?

29:32.971 --> 29:34.105
'Cause it's like,
I didn't know

29:34.205 --> 29:36.141
Thomas Jefferson
was a cross-dresser.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.175
Yeah.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.777
So the details are all there.

29:38.877 --> 29:42.714
But visually, it just looks
bulky and messy.

29:42.814 --> 29:45.216
And then your
Crystal Eleganza,

29:45.316 --> 29:47.452
this is a tough fabric
to work with, that satin.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.488
To me, it looks like it needs
to be pulled up a little bit.

29:50.588 --> 29:51.556
[laughter]

29:51.656 --> 29:53.258
Yeah, it needs that.

29:53.358 --> 29:54.993
You do have
such a beautiful figure,

29:55.093 --> 29:57.395
and I would love
to see more of that.

29:57.495 --> 30:00.265
You always get
so close, Salina.

30:00.365 --> 30:03.601
And your personality
is what I'm in love with.

30:03.701 --> 30:06.538
But I also want to be
in love with your drag.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.907
All right, up next, Spice.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.575
Your Start Your Engines look,

30:10.675 --> 30:12.710
talk about
nailing the details.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.112
Having that checkered flag

30:14.212 --> 30:15.580
with the ding-a-ling
messaging,

30:15.680 --> 30:17.782
and then there was
a checkerboard crystal detail

30:17.882 --> 30:19.918
on the boots,
which was incredible.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.887
Your favorite ball,
you did the Balls Ball.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.389
It was cute.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.658
I mean, we've had many people
do the hairball routine,

30:26.758 --> 30:28.193
so it becomes redundant.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.728
And this, the corset
on this is really cute.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.764
The skirt is the piece
of fabric tied together.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.532
There's no finished hem
on that.

30:34.632 --> 30:37.368
- Is that just cut?
- It's glued, hot glue.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.837
I think the biggest sin
of the outfit,

30:38.937 --> 30:41.673
for me, is that you took
the Balls Ball

30:41.773 --> 30:43.441
and you just covered it
in disco stuff.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.043
Oh, yeah, I didn't
make that connection.

30:45.143 --> 30:46.311
Yeah.
[laughter]

30:46.411 --> 30:47.812
I was like--

30:47.912 --> 30:49.013
I think my favorite thing

30:49.113 --> 30:50.248
about your whole
performance tonight

30:50.348 --> 30:52.951
was watching you
fight the urge.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.419
Fight--yeah, you just--

30:54.519 --> 30:58.489
you literally were like,
uh, uh, uh.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.325
We could get her one
of those shocker collars

31:00.425 --> 31:01.793
- and you can have the button.
- Literally!

31:01.893 --> 31:03.995
I need to go zznt, zznt.

31:04.095 --> 31:08.066
Up next,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.268
Start Your Engines was fun.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.871
Catchphrases from so many
different queens.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.440
This beach ball look,
it's iconic.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.643
It's high drag.
It's really chic.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.778
And then this,
you had the high art

31:20.879 --> 31:23.581
and then you had
old Hollywood glamour,

31:23.681 --> 31:24.883
and you just
looked like a star.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.918
It's all beautiful.

31:27.018 --> 31:29.520
As the weeks go on,
Mistress, I keep getting

31:29.621 --> 31:31.322
more and more impressed.

31:31.422 --> 31:32.357
Thank you.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.726
Up next, Loosey LaDuca.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.427
Start Your Engines,
I thought was really fun.

31:36.527 --> 31:40.164
It was kind of Judy Jetson goes
into the futuristic pit stop

31:40.265 --> 31:43.468
and gets her chassis lubed
and all sorts of fun things.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.905
What let me down tonight,
Loosey, was your Bag Ball.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.439
I thought it was too simple.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.941
It looked like
an afterthought.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.443
That whole skirt should have
been made out of plastic bags,

31:52.543 --> 31:54.178
because then the bodice--
while it was pretty,

31:54.279 --> 31:56.581
it was just St. Pauli Girl.

31:56.681 --> 31:59.817
This look, I do love
that see-through quality.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.620
For me, where it goes a little
south is that, you know,

32:02.720 --> 32:04.856
mermaid detail at the bottom.

32:04.956 --> 32:09.127
I would have lowered that trim
of stones an inch or two

32:09.227 --> 32:13.464
to just give you more of that,
you know, mermaid shape.

32:13.564 --> 32:14.966
All right, up next,

32:15.066 --> 32:17.468
Sasha Colby
Carrington Zeta Jones.

32:17.568 --> 32:18.703
[laughter]

32:18.803 --> 32:23.041
In every look,
you look absolutely stunt-ing.

32:23.141 --> 32:25.243
That first Start Your Engines look

32:25.343 --> 32:28.079
was very elegant
but also very sexy.

32:28.179 --> 32:29.247
When you went
into your Bag Ball

32:29.347 --> 32:30.715
and you were a dime bag,

32:30.815 --> 32:33.484
I loved the details
of the blunt hat,

32:33.584 --> 32:35.987
the giant weed
across the bodice.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.922
It was just all
really beautiful.

32:38.022 --> 32:40.391
And your
Crystallized look is--

32:40.491 --> 32:42.327
I mean, it's so stunning.

32:42.427 --> 32:45.330
It looks like something that
would be from the Met Gala.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.932
You know, Sasha,
you're also a success story

32:48.032 --> 32:49.567
of the house system.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.669
I know that you come
from the Colbys.

32:51.769 --> 32:52.837
How did you find them?

32:52.937 --> 32:55.673
I was really fortunate
to enroll in dance

32:55.773 --> 32:56.874
when I was in high school.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.978
And I was a closeted
Jehovah's Witness.

33:00.078 --> 33:03.314
Scared to show--tell anyone
how feminine I was

33:03.414 --> 33:04.849
or that I already felt trans.

33:04.949 --> 33:09.053
And my queer family,
who are all dancers,

33:09.153 --> 33:11.789
took me in,
took me to my first drag show.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.858
And it saved my life.

33:13.958 --> 33:16.761
And it's made this such a joy--

33:16.861 --> 33:18.629
this life such a joy to live.

33:18.730 --> 33:23.001
You do your house
very, very proud.

33:23.101 --> 33:26.771
And sharing your story,
it lasts forever.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.306
Thank you.

33:28.406 --> 33:32.210
Last but not least,
Anetra is here.

33:32.310 --> 33:36.447
Start Your Engines,
oh, my favorite color--

33:36.547 --> 33:38.616
neon green!

33:38.716 --> 33:40.651
Actually, I loved
the way you wore it.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.921
There's just a lot of details
that you do so well.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.923
The Sugar Ball, for me--
you know,

33:46.024 --> 33:48.826
the bustier thing, I wasn't
quite sure what that was.

33:48.926 --> 33:50.762
Those were my taffy titties.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.731
- Mm.
- [laughs]

33:53.831 --> 33:56.100
It just looked
a little incomplete to me.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.736
And then when you compare it
to what you have on now,

33:58.836 --> 34:01.773
I mean, the fact that you
made this overnight

34:01.873 --> 34:03.775
and you have the perfect
trumpet hemline,

34:03.875 --> 34:07.078
the craftsmanship
is like couture.

34:07.178 --> 34:08.413
It's gorgeous.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.148
I don't think I've ever
seen a dress like that.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.516
It's a beautiful silhouette.

34:11.616 --> 34:14.952
But you've added this sort of
McQueen danger to it

34:15.053 --> 34:17.789
with the shards
that looks like vertebrae.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.091
I want to give you
a little note,

34:20.191 --> 34:22.560
from one resting bitch face
to another.

34:22.660 --> 34:23.628
No.
[laughter]

34:23.728 --> 34:25.396
I already knew it!

34:25.496 --> 34:27.965
When we're in drag,
we're in character.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.635
So remember to tell your face
that you're having fun.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.936
Mm.
You don't--

34:32.036 --> 34:34.238
[laughter]
You don't have to think it.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.641
But instead of looking like
you're gonna kill someone...

34:36.741 --> 34:38.876
- I'm sorry.
- You can even smize.

34:38.976 --> 34:42.080
Just remind yourself not to
look like the Deathly Hallows.

34:42.180 --> 34:43.247
- Okay.
- Okay?
