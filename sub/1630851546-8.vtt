WEBVTT

00:03.873 --> 00:06.006
[knocking on door]

00:08.138 --> 00:09.792
Oh, hi.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.663
Agent Park, I'm guessing
you're not here

00:11.707 --> 00:13.491
on a social call.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.798
I wanted to tell you in
person.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.843
Richard Trott died
in the hospital this morning.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.846
Complications
from his stroke.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.544
Oh, my God.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.679
Trott didn't kill
Jake Cazine,

00:27.723 --> 00:30.247
but it's likely he had info
on whoever did.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.162
Could be someone
was trying to silence him.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.337
Could be somebody

00:33.381 --> 00:36.166
was simply upset
he was about to walk.

00:36.210 --> 00:39.822
I'm investigating his death
for foul play.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.520
Is there anything at all that
you wanted to share with me,

00:42.564 --> 00:43.826
since you were at the station

00:43.869 --> 00:45.262
when Trott collapsed?

00:45.306 --> 00:47.090
I was just working
in the bullpen.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.570
Security footage shows
that your desk was empty

00:48.613 --> 00:50.398
until you rushed in
with Temperance.

00:50.441 --> 00:53.140
Where were you
right before that?

00:53.183 --> 00:55.403
That is enough.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.405
We have to go now.

00:57.448 --> 01:00.408
We were just walking in
from the parking lot together.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.193
Is there
anything else?

01:03.237 --> 01:05.239
[sighs]

01:08.720 --> 01:11.375
I'll get back
to you on that.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.258
â™ª

01:35.399 --> 01:37.401
We're going to call
the supernatural killer

01:37.445 --> 01:39.534
the "Copperhead" because
of the hat it wears.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.753
Oh. Um, I thought of that.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.320
Um, I did an
image search and found

01:43.364 --> 01:45.409
this political cartoon
from the Civil War,

01:45.453 --> 01:47.672
uh, with Copperheadsin hats.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.239
Snakes wearing hats,

01:49.283 --> 01:51.415
which is a thing again
on Pinterest.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.243
Yeah, but you were there
for the O.G. version.

01:53.287 --> 01:56.594
You know, sometimes I forget
you've been alive since 1824.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.422
You look amazing,
by the way.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.816
And you've
actually been

02:00.859 --> 02:02.339
to its
underground lair?

02:02.383 --> 02:04.602
Yeah. Yes, so Nancy
found the cage

02:04.646 --> 02:06.691
that you saw
in Trott's memory weave.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.258
Now, the Copperhead
was imprisoned there

02:08.302 --> 02:09.694
until Hannah Gruen let it out.

02:09.738 --> 02:13.176
As head intern,
I feel it is my duty

02:13.220 --> 02:15.265
to clean up
her mess.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.614
[sighs]

02:16.658 --> 02:18.442
You want to torture Hannah?

02:18.486 --> 02:19.617
No.

02:19.661 --> 02:20.923
No. Uh...

02:20.966 --> 02:23.621
I'm digitizing
the Historical Society database,

02:23.665 --> 02:24.666
and I came upon

02:24.709 --> 02:26.233
this device
that's been used

02:26.276 --> 02:27.799
to trap supernatural
entities before.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.410
I want to use it
to catch the Copperhead

02:29.453 --> 02:30.889
before it kills again.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.327
Now, I found this incantation
to activate the trap,

02:33.370 --> 02:35.198
but I still need bait.

02:36.852 --> 02:40.464
Well, you have me as a mentor,

02:40.508 --> 02:42.510
and I have a charm

02:42.553 --> 02:44.860
made of ancient whale tooth
that would work.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.209
Whale tooth.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.864
Random, but great. Yes.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.697
That's odd.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.878
Is that a soul-splitter?

03:02.921 --> 03:05.533
Yeah. Yeah, I, um,
I separated

03:05.576 --> 03:08.013
George and Odette's souls.

03:08.057 --> 03:10.755
Now George gets to live
a very long life.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.759
Just a few days ago,

03:14.803 --> 03:17.327
you couldn't pull off
a protection charm.

03:17.371 --> 03:20.852
And now, you've performed
a lifesaving ritual.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.681
I was right to put
my faith in you.

03:23.725 --> 03:24.856
[footsteps approaching]

03:24.900 --> 03:26.249
What are you doing here?

03:26.293 --> 03:27.468
Well, she has bait.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.730
Mystical bait.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.340
She's gonna help us
catch the Copperhead.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.864
Oh, will she? Because, last time
she helped, she went rogue.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.562
And now
Trott's dead.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.781
Agent Park
is investigating his death,

03:36.825 --> 03:38.870
and he believes that you and I
were involved, which we were,

03:38.914 --> 03:41.003
because you gave Trott
a fatal stroke

03:41.046 --> 03:42.657
and made me
your accomplice.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.747
I have pledged to rid this town
of evil forces,

03:45.790 --> 03:49.272
and that now includes you.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.361
Get out.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.584
You are making
a mistake.

03:56.627 --> 03:57.585
Mm.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.936
Wait. No, go apologize now.

04:00.979 --> 04:02.459
She can help us.

04:02.503 --> 04:03.721
Bess,

04:03.765 --> 04:06.376
I refuse to be a pawn
in her game.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.074
[sighs]

04:09.118 --> 04:11.512
Should we call the cops now?

04:11.555 --> 04:13.688
No crimes reported
on the scanner,

04:13.731 --> 04:15.820
and he has not been admitted
to the local hospital

04:15.864 --> 04:17.431
or urgent care.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.390
[scoffs] Why would Nick just
drive off without his phone?

04:20.434 --> 04:21.652
Maybe he's trying
to disconnect

04:21.696 --> 04:23.567
without us being able
to track him?

04:23.611 --> 04:24.960
Or maybe it's me.
I was only planning

04:25.003 --> 04:26.701
on couch surfing
a couple nights, but...

04:26.744 --> 04:30.400
Is he trying
to avoid jury duty?

04:30.444 --> 04:32.359
Wait, was he trying
to avoid me? Are...

04:32.402 --> 04:33.664
Are we not okay?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.971
You seemed fine together
the last time I saw you.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.886
[knock on door]Oh...

04:37.929 --> 04:39.888
Maybe he forgot his keys.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.934
Hey.
Hey.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.719
You're not Nick.
Where's Nick?

04:44.762 --> 04:45.850
So, still no word?

04:45.894 --> 04:48.331
Okay, I'm gonna
help you guys look.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.115
I'm gonna check
The Claw again.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.640
Thank you.All right, yeah.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.991
So, I guess
it's you and me.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.645
Yeah.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.387
I mean, probably cover
more ground if we split up,

05:00.430 --> 05:01.779
but... unless
you're here

05:01.823 --> 05:03.390
because you're having
an existential crisis,

05:03.433 --> 05:04.913
you don't want to be alone
with your thoughts.

05:04.956 --> 05:08.308
An existential crisis. Come on,
does that sound like me?

05:11.006 --> 05:12.486
Okay, your car or mine?

05:14.749 --> 05:17.665
Thank you for returning
my grimoire.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.363
I'm guessing you're
not here to digitize

05:20.407 --> 05:23.410
my files for the archives.No.

05:23.453 --> 05:26.935
No, I-I'm here to ask you
to help us catch the Copperhead.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.067
I've been very helpful,

05:29.111 --> 05:31.505
but Nancy treats me
like a villain.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.988
Are you with her or with me?

05:37.032 --> 05:38.816
I'm-I'm with you both.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.993
So, maybe I could
still use the bait?

05:42.037 --> 05:45.127
You can't handle
its power on your own.

05:45.170 --> 05:48.348
I'm not in the mood
to offer any guidance.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.488
Hey. Did you get the bait?

05:58.532 --> 05:59.924
As requested,

05:59.968 --> 06:02.492
but I don't feel good
about stealing from Temperance.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.494
Well, you're gonna
feel a lot better

06:04.538 --> 06:07.062
when we catch the Copperhead
and stop it from killing again.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.067
[sighing]

06:12.110 --> 06:15.070
Okay, do we have to do this
so near Icarus Hall?

06:15.113 --> 06:16.680
I mean, Temperance
could find us.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.161
Well, the Copperhead showed up
at Temperance's house,

06:19.204 --> 06:22.730
and I think it's
drawn to these woods.

06:22.773 --> 06:26.037
Okay. Do your thing, please.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.735
Okay.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.956
[exhales]

06:34.698 --> 06:36.700
I call upon this snare

06:36.744 --> 06:39.573
to trap all evil
that roams.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.139
Guardian spirits,

06:41.183 --> 06:43.751
protect us
from wayfaring harm.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.450
[sighs]

06:47.494 --> 06:49.104
Okay.

06:55.719 --> 06:58.548
You see anything?

06:58.592 --> 06:59.767
Oh, God...

06:59.810 --> 07:02.073
So, we're just crouching
in the woods now?

07:02.117 --> 07:05.250
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's really good
for the quads, so...

07:05.294 --> 07:06.904
Just...

07:06.948 --> 07:08.123
What are you doing here?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.733
Well, I wanted to ask Temperance

07:09.777 --> 07:11.474
about the day
Trott had his stroke.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.694
She made an appointment
with me that same afternoon,

07:13.737 --> 07:15.783
but when I arrived
at Icarus Hall,

07:15.826 --> 07:18.568
no Temperance, only Bess.

07:18.612 --> 07:21.266
Yeah, well, that was just
a mix-up. It can happen.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.094
Huh. Didn't seem
like happenstance,

07:23.138 --> 07:24.792
especially since you kept me
away from the station

07:24.835 --> 07:26.228
right before Trott collapsed.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.099
[loud bang]

07:30.188 --> 07:32.930
TEMPERANCE:
What did you do?

07:32.974 --> 07:34.845
We set a trap to catch
the Copperhead.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.195
That's not the Copperhead.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.502
Watch out!

07:39.546 --> 07:41.635
[grunts][gasps]

07:41.678 --> 07:43.898
[groaning]

07:45.247 --> 07:47.771
We have to run. Now.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.164
Come on.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.955
NANCY: So, whatever
we caught has escaped.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.001
Have you seen this before?
Light monsters?

08:00.044 --> 08:02.612
No,

08:02.656 --> 08:05.615
but you have access to the
Historical Society database.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.791
I can't run and search
at the same time.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.185
You all seem to have calmly
skipped past the premise.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.969
Oh, I'm not calm.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.188
He means we're
not questioning

08:13.231 --> 08:15.146
the existence of
the supernatural.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.020
[groaning]

08:19.063 --> 08:22.110
So, this kind of thing
happens in Horseshoe Bay.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.807
It's in all
the visitor brochures.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.635
I've read about
the quaint seaside rituals

08:25.679 --> 08:27.071
and haunted hotels,

08:27.115 --> 08:28.769
not entities that can kill you
with beams of light.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.988
[groaning] That would hardly
attract tourism.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.686
Okay, is there something
I can get you for your pain,

08:32.729 --> 08:34.209
like a spell,
a mystical ointment,

08:34.252 --> 08:35.297
an ibuprofen?

08:35.340 --> 08:36.690
Willow bark...
Okay.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.169
...in my dispensary jars.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.694
We need to block
all the windows.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.616
Letting Temperance
off the hook?

08:51.356 --> 08:54.185
Triage. If a light monster's
trying to burn us to death,

08:54.229 --> 08:55.578
then we need to deal
with that first.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.841
And you're okay
with light monster?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.974
No scientific
explanation needed?

09:00.017 --> 09:02.193
Just because science
can't explain it,

09:02.237 --> 09:03.760
doesn't mean it's not real.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.850
Huh. That's refreshingly
open-minded.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.287
What were you trying to catch?
Bess called it the Copperhead?

09:09.331 --> 09:11.115
Oh, that would be
the serial killer

09:11.159 --> 09:12.726
that you're looking for.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.902
Turns out, that's also a thing
science can't explain.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.034
Well, then elaborate
without science.

09:17.078 --> 09:20.124
Like you said, triage.

09:20.168 --> 09:22.213
Deal with the
light monster first.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.085
[seagull calling]

09:27.654 --> 09:29.917
Hello? Can I help you?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.179
EVE:
Oh, sorry.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.789
I was just leaving
a note for Ned.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.661
I'm Eve. Pronouns, she/her.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.141
George. She/her.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.708
You know Nick?

09:38.752 --> 09:40.710
You're Ned's fiancÃ©e, right?

09:40.754 --> 09:42.799
Congrats. [chuckles]

09:42.843 --> 09:45.367
I'm a friend of Ned's
from Florida. We go way back,

09:45.410 --> 09:48.109
to, like, diapers.
He's basically my brother.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.025
Uh, is he around?

09:51.068 --> 09:54.245
I... don't know where he is.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.073
Actually, it's-it's

09:56.117 --> 09:58.902
really weird timing, you showing
up on the day that he's missing.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.730
Well, no,
not-not missing-missing.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.123
He's just...

10:02.166 --> 10:04.691
off the grid, temporarily.

10:04.734 --> 10:07.171
Growing up, if Ned
had something on his mind,

10:07.215 --> 10:09.260
he'd disappear
to handle it alone,

10:09.304 --> 10:11.088
usually with a pint
of butter pecan.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.873
[chuckles]
Drove his mom crazy.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.439
Yeah, he's done that before,

10:14.483 --> 10:16.920
but I checked his freezer,
and it's-it's fully stocked.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.140
So, he hasn't changed that much.

10:19.183 --> 10:22.752
I'm gonna go look for him
if you want to come.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.667
Maybe it'll give us a chance to
get to know each other better?

10:24.711 --> 10:25.712
I'd love that.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.935
First time in Maine?

10:31.979 --> 10:34.808
Is it that obvious?

10:34.851 --> 10:36.679
Mm.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.378
ACE:
Nick?

10:40.422 --> 10:43.033
You can have your couch back.
I'll go.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.125
Okay, nothing, so maybe
it's-it's not about the couch,

10:48.169 --> 10:49.692
which is-is good news.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.694
[loud clanging]

10:54.088 --> 10:56.917
Who's there?

10:56.960 --> 10:59.876
Probably just
old pipes.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.835
"Probably just
old pipes" who?

11:09.886 --> 11:11.932
[beeping]

11:11.975 --> 11:14.151
Maybe Nick was here.
I'll look.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.287
Question.
Yeah?

11:19.330 --> 11:22.159
You've been occupying
Drew sofa space all month.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.813
Does that feeling
ever go away?

11:23.857 --> 11:25.336
The bad back? No.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.295
No, no, you just,
you adapt.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.210
I mean the burden.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.169
That feeling, you know,
from the... freeloading.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.128
Oh, dude, listen,
listen, listen.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.870
You don't, you don't have
to be so hard on yourself, okay?

11:36.913 --> 11:38.262
Hey, you're doing fine.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.916
Am I?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.396
Is a grown man
who can't afford rent

11:41.439 --> 11:43.050
and doesn't know what
he's doing with his life fine?

11:43.093 --> 11:45.835
Okay, define

11:45.879 --> 11:47.445
"freeloading."

11:47.489 --> 11:51.058
Don't sweat it. I mean, you're
allowed to be the couch guy.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.364
Dad got arrested, you lost
all your money. It's fine.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.409
[door creaks]

12:00.589 --> 12:02.983
[door handle jiggles]It's stuck.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.813
[door handle jiggles][groans]

12:06.856 --> 12:09.380
[knocks on door]Hey, let us out.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.382
Who you talking to?

12:11.426 --> 12:15.212
Whatever's trapped us in here.
Guessing it's supernatural.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.214
How do you know
it's not just rusty hinges?

12:17.258 --> 12:19.956
[clanging]

12:22.611 --> 12:25.266
I've developed a feel
for these things.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.226
So, I searched the
Historical Society database.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.533
This thing is called
the Burning Sorrows.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.100
It's not human.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.405
Premise accepted.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.886
Okay, so it scorches
people to death

12:36.930 --> 12:39.236
in order to feed on
their greatest heartbreaks.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.804
Um, rays of
poisonous light

12:41.848 --> 12:43.588
extend like limbs
from its body,

12:43.632 --> 12:44.981
and if it burns you,

12:45.025 --> 12:46.374
then the venom
in the wound

12:46.417 --> 12:48.463
will awaken your
most painful memories.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.857
Uh, symptoms include:
delirium,

12:50.900 --> 12:52.554
infection at the point
of contact,

12:52.597 --> 12:54.817
emitting suffering,

12:54.861 --> 12:58.038
whatever that means,
uh, and death.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.953
Got any good news
in there?

12:59.996 --> 13:01.868
BESS:
If it consumes
your most gut-wrenching

13:01.911 --> 13:04.435
memory before you die, then
it returns to a dormant state,

13:04.479 --> 13:07.221
and the venom is neutralized.
That's good-ish.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.179
Yeah.
Then it hibernates

13:09.223 --> 13:12.095
until something awakes it again,
something like us novices

13:12.139 --> 13:15.838
misusing powerful
supernatural bait.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.885
We need to protect her.
Maybe we can feed

13:18.928 --> 13:21.061
the Burning Sorrows
other heartbreaks instead.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.932
Yeah, it could work.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.456
We got the Wraith's attention
by feeding it my fears, so...

13:25.500 --> 13:27.284
How often does this
happen to you?

13:27.328 --> 13:29.330
Often enough.

13:29.373 --> 13:32.463
Let's give it a try.
I've got heartbreaks to spare.

13:42.691 --> 13:45.476
L-Losing Odette to save George.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.523
Lying to Lisbeth to protect her.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.394
Betraying Aunt Diana.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.483
I think it's working.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.921
Getting kicked out
by my mum.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.227
Losing my mom
and my biological mother.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.577
My grandmother getting
murdered because of me.

13:59.621 --> 14:02.450
Finding out that my parents
aren't my birth parents.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.887
Eleanor Harris.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.892

14:09.936 --> 14:12.895
[groaning]NANCY: It wants Temperance.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.897
She's marked.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.681
So, the only way

14:16.725 --> 14:18.205
to get out
of here alive

14:18.248 --> 14:21.077
is to find out Temperance's
greatest heartbreak

14:21.121 --> 14:22.644
and feed it
to the monster.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.386
Do you really think Temperance
is capable of heartbreak?

14:27.214 --> 14:29.477
All I ever wanted
to do was help.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.915
Okay, so help.
Let's talk heartbreaks.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.048
[sizzling][screaming]

14:47.712 --> 14:49.976
She's not real.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.455
[shudders]

14:51.499 --> 14:53.718
It's impossible.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.546
Who is that?

14:55.590 --> 14:58.419
My daughter, Charity.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.681
NANCY:Is she your
greatest heartbreak?

14:59.724 --> 15:02.075
Because we need to feed her
to the monster.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.557
You cannot have her! [screams]

15:06.601 --> 15:07.950
Temperance.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.692
It's okay.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.050
[laughter]

15:21.094 --> 15:23.400
So, this girl just shows up
knowing all these things

15:23.444 --> 15:25.620
about you and Nick today?

15:25.663 --> 15:27.404
Relax. Eve checks out.
Look.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.232
She's got a boyfriend,
her sisters like BTS,

15:29.276 --> 15:31.278
and she knows her way
around a comma.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.627
What's not to like?

15:32.670 --> 15:34.498
Yeah, how far back
did you scroll?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.109
Enough for you.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.372
You're not the only one who
gets to be overprotective, okay?

15:38.415 --> 15:39.634
[kids laughing]

15:39.677 --> 15:41.288
KID: Can you tell us
more stories about Nick?

15:41.331 --> 15:42.419
KID 2:
Yeah!

15:42.463 --> 15:44.421
Why do you keep
calling him Ned?

15:44.465 --> 15:45.770
That's his real name.

15:45.814 --> 15:49.035
He must've just started
going by Nick recently.

15:49.078 --> 15:52.125
So did you know him
before he got arrested?

15:52.168 --> 15:54.388
Back when
he played football?

15:54.431 --> 15:57.521
Never spoke
about his past, huh?

15:57.565 --> 15:59.523
He told us about it
yesterday.

15:59.567 --> 16:03.179
Oh, he did.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.702
Um...
[clears throat]

16:04.746 --> 16:06.356
Yeah, the kids
drew pictures

16:06.400 --> 16:08.010
of what they want to be
when they grow up.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.403
It got Nick
and I talking

16:09.446 --> 16:13.015
about what we wanted
to be, before.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.104
And then he went MIA.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.714
I did mention that going
on a walkabout helped me

16:16.758 --> 16:18.281
when I had
a lot to process.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.544
So...
A walkabout?

16:20.588 --> 16:22.285
Where would he
walkabout to

16:22.329 --> 16:24.548
and what-what is he
walking about about?

16:24.592 --> 16:27.290
Uh... what's been
on his mind lately?

16:29.249 --> 16:32.034
That is a very
good question.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.384
[cell phone buzzes]

16:34.428 --> 16:36.038
What are you...

16:42.697 --> 16:44.699
Hey, I-I got to go.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.048
EVE:
When he was your age,

16:46.092 --> 16:47.484
he was a total goofball.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.051
Ned would've gotten
detention more,

16:49.095 --> 16:50.661
but he was so good
at making the teachers laugh.

16:50.705 --> 16:53.099
[laughter]

17:04.153 --> 17:05.807
[knocks on window]Oh. Can you, can you
open the door?

17:05.850 --> 17:08.462
You lied.
You have been to Maine.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.642
I forgot that was
on my timeline.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.079
Why are you here?
Are you in love with Nick?

17:17.123 --> 17:18.863
No, I'm not in love with him.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.301
Why would I believe
anything that you say?

17:21.344 --> 17:22.563
[car engine sputters]

17:25.870 --> 17:27.437
Go inside before you
freeze to death, okay?

17:27.481 --> 17:28.525
I'll find Nick myself.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.050
[car engine starts]

17:32.225 --> 17:33.704
Yes.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.402

17:40.189 --> 17:42.148
NANCY:
The archives said
the Burning Sorrows' venom

17:42.191 --> 17:44.367
awakens painful memories
in its victims,

17:44.411 --> 17:47.327
so maybe what we're seeing is
Temperance emitting suffering,

17:47.370 --> 17:49.111
projecting memories.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.591
The girl,
Temperance's daughter,

17:50.634 --> 17:52.375
was from an entirely
different era.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.116
Yes, I noticed.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.509
What if we told
you that Temperance

17:55.552 --> 17:57.119
is about 200 years old?

17:57.163 --> 17:58.729
I'd say she aged well.
What's her secret?

17:58.773 --> 18:00.340
Does it matter if we
can't save her now?

18:00.383 --> 18:01.776
Point taken.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.170
There are few things
in this life more heartbreaking

18:04.213 --> 18:06.302
than the loss
of a child.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.391
Must be what
the monster wants.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.785
Okay, can we just tread lightly?

18:10.828 --> 18:14.223
Got it.
How did Charity die?

18:14.267 --> 18:15.442
Nancy, you can't...

18:15.485 --> 18:18.314
More tea.

18:18.358 --> 18:21.143
Temperance, we want
to help you survive.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.798
Could you tell us
about your daughter?

18:25.626 --> 18:28.368

is in the town records.BESS: Tea.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.203
at the age of 18. She was
survived by her husband..."

18:37.246 --> 18:39.248
He's the reason that she's gone.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.207
Did Charity's husband
kill her?

18:41.250 --> 18:44.297
[sizzling][groaning]

18:51.260 --> 18:54.437
Charity was a nurse
in the Civil War.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.832
Uh, she was a part of
the 20th Maine Regiment.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.922
Listed as a casualty
at the Battle of Gettysburg.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.664

is this Gettysburg?

NANCY:
There's Charity again.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.505
Were you there when she died?

NANCY:
In 1863,

19:20.811 --> 19:23.466
Temperance was in hiding,
presumed dead.

19:23.510 --> 19:26.643
Yet I risked everything

19:26.687 --> 19:28.341
to try to find

19:28.384 --> 19:30.865
my daughter.

19:30.908 --> 19:34.347
I went to Gettysburg,

19:34.390 --> 19:36.740

like we did with George.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.235
TEMPERANCE:
The Women in White
had a willing pawn

19:53.279 --> 19:56.499
perform the soul-splitter ritual
on Charity.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.590
They split her soul
into four pieces,

20:00.634 --> 20:02.462
which they entwined
with the souls

20:02.505 --> 20:04.377
of four soldiers
on the battlefield,

20:04.420 --> 20:06.901
so that I would never find her.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.469
So, they split
Charity's soul

20:09.512 --> 20:12.036
to keep her mother
from saying goodbye?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.822
I can't imagine
a greater heartbreak.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.345
That's got to be the one.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.391
How do we feed it
to the Burning Sorrows?

20:20.349 --> 20:22.264
We open up
the windows.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.961
Let it in.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.463
Okay, the thing is,
is that right now...

22:14.507 --> 22:16.073
Nothing. We're, uh...

22:16.117 --> 22:17.597
[whispers]:
Ask her for help.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.033
...look-looking for Nick.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.730
I'm sure that he'll...

22:21.775 --> 22:23.167
Is he okay?

22:23.211 --> 22:24.865
I, um...

22:26.432 --> 22:28.999
I'm trying to solve a puzzle.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.480
Ace, can you look
at those photos you took

22:31.524 --> 22:33.482
of Matthew Burke's tent?

22:33.526 --> 22:36.529
I remember him writing
about recurring nightmares

22:36.572 --> 22:38.487
about a battlefield.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.097
I just was wondering
if his nightmares

22:40.141 --> 22:41.664
were about Gettysburg.

22:41.708 --> 22:42.883
[knocking]

22:42.926 --> 22:44.624
What's going on over there?

22:44.667 --> 22:46.147
We're stuck in...Nothing.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.496
Uh, we're...

22:47.540 --> 22:49.455
Tent pictures, Gettysburg--
we're on that.

22:49.498 --> 22:50.891
Thank you. Bye.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.762
[knocking]

22:52.806 --> 22:54.155
Why didn't you tell her
we were trapped in here

22:54.198 --> 22:58.420
by some supernatural,
angry door lock?

22:58.464 --> 23:01.858
'Cause it sounded like she was
dealing with something herself.

23:01.902 --> 23:04.078
And I'm tired of leaning
on other people

23:04.121 --> 23:06.036
to fix my messes for me.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.908
You should be, too.

23:07.951 --> 23:11.781
Hey. Listen,
whatever's going on in your life

23:11.825 --> 23:15.481
or with Nancy,
don't take it out on me, okay?

23:16.525 --> 23:17.831
It's not about Nancy.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.529
Keep telling
yourself that.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.575
[departing footsteps]

23:27.057 --> 23:28.798
PARK:
Here.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.583
Let me help you.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.411
[sighs]

23:37.241 --> 23:41.724
Didn't expect your go-to move
to be "mystical blood ritual."

23:41.768 --> 23:43.726
But I admire
the commitment.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.467
Oh. Same.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.556
[chuckles]:
You, uh, you jumped
into the situation

23:47.600 --> 23:50.559
with commendable zeal.

23:50.603 --> 23:53.693
Seem like the type of
person who goes all in.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.566
Like when we were shouting
heartbreaks earlier

23:57.610 --> 23:59.742
and you said a name.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.788
Eleanor Harris.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.660
She the, uh...

24:04.704 --> 24:08.011
one that got away? [chuckles]

24:10.666 --> 24:13.277
I never met Eleanor Harris.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.584
I saw her in the ER

24:15.628 --> 24:17.673
at a teaching hospital
in Connecticut

24:17.717 --> 24:20.589
while I was doing
my psych residency there.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.245
What happened to Eleanor?

24:27.988 --> 24:30.991
Multiple gunshot wounds
from an assault rifle

24:31.034 --> 24:33.167
in a school shooting.

24:33.994 --> 24:38.172
Brought her in
under this blood-soaked sheet.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.003
Hoping for some kind
of miracle.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.789
Even though she'd bled out
in two or three seconds

24:46.833 --> 24:50.706
from the bullet fragments
that...

24:50.750 --> 24:52.752
tore apart her abdomen.

24:56.582 --> 25:00.629
But, uh, no EMT wants to declare
a six-year-old

25:00.673 --> 25:02.849
dead at the scene.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.722
People want to believe
they did everything

25:06.766 --> 25:08.855
they possibly could.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.905
So they, uh...

25:15.949 --> 25:17.951
brought her to the hospital,

25:17.994 --> 25:20.823
and we waited...

25:20.867 --> 25:23.870
for the doctor
to pronounce her...

25:26.089 --> 25:29.223
Eleanor Harris is why
I went into law enforcement.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.662
Why I became a profiler.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.056
And why you don't carry a gun?

25:37.753 --> 25:39.712
[sighs]

25:40.974 --> 25:42.976
She is exactly why.

25:46.283 --> 25:50.026
After seeing what Eleanor's
parents went through...

25:51.245 --> 25:52.638
...it's hard to imagine

25:52.681 --> 25:54.248
Temperance has
a worse heartbreak

25:54.291 --> 25:56.293
than watching her daughter die.

26:02.691 --> 26:07.174
That Gettysburg memory
was more than that.

26:07.217 --> 26:10.133
Temperance said that the
Women in White had...

26:10.177 --> 26:12.658
a "pawn" there.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.877
Who was he?

26:18.228 --> 26:20.317
PARK:
Tell me
about the Women in White.

26:20.361 --> 26:25.235
They were once
my dearest friends.

26:26.062 --> 26:29.283
But when they could
no longer understand my hopes,

26:29.326 --> 26:32.025
they turned against me.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.593
[Temperance screams][whooshes]

26:36.725 --> 26:39.249
BESS:
That's Cora Dow.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.643
That's the Woman in White
who got Temperance kicked out

26:41.687 --> 26:43.340
of Horseshoe Bay.

26:43.384 --> 26:47.693
TEMPERANCE:
Cora Dow poisoned the mind
of Charity's father.

26:51.218 --> 26:54.787
She told him
to take Charity away from me.

26:57.137 --> 27:00.009
That's the doll
from the Copperhead's cage.

27:02.359 --> 27:05.319
Why does he have it?

27:05.362 --> 27:07.060
[quietly]:
No.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.975
[in unison with other voices]:
No.

27:09.018 --> 27:12.282
[with Temperance]:
No. No.

27:12.326 --> 27:14.067
OTHERS:
No. No.What's going on?

27:14.110 --> 27:16.678
No. No.Her subconscious
is pushing back.

27:18.288 --> 27:21.683
Get away from me!

27:29.735 --> 27:31.301
They're just figments.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.825
Th-They can't...

27:32.868 --> 27:34.783
[screams]NANCY:
Bess!

27:42.225 --> 27:44.837
PARK:
It's a literal defense mechanism

27:44.880 --> 27:46.403
to keep us from discovering
her heartbreak.

27:46.447 --> 27:47.753
[table rattling]

27:54.455 --> 27:55.717
Oh!

27:55.761 --> 27:57.676
[grunts]

28:12.255 --> 28:14.388
NANCY:
We need to let the light in.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.216
The-the Burning Sorrows

28:16.259 --> 28:18.131
destroyed the specters before,

28:18.174 --> 28:19.828
so we can use it
as a weapon.

28:22.439 --> 28:23.789
[whooshing]

28:33.102 --> 28:34.713
[whooshing]

28:37.411 --> 28:38.934
[gasping breath]

28:38.978 --> 28:40.196
What hurt you more

28:40.240 --> 28:42.285
than having your child
torn away from you?

28:42.329 --> 28:44.287
What greater heartbreak
is there

28:44.331 --> 28:46.376
than watching
your daughter die?

28:46.420 --> 28:48.378
When did you
truly lose her?

28:48.422 --> 28:52.034
When she betrayed me w...
with her choice.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.470
What did she choose?Not what.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.211
Who.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.039
Beckett Dow.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.781
[sizzling][screaming]

29:07.310 --> 29:09.791
Charity's married name was Dow.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.968
And... Cora Dow
exiled Temperance.

29:14.448 --> 29:18.365
Then Cora's son married
Temperance's daughter.

29:18.408 --> 29:22.238
So the man who split
Charity's soul was her husband?

29:25.067 --> 29:28.114
You told Cora Dow
that I was still alive,

29:28.157 --> 29:30.420
and then she forced her son
to elope with you

29:30.464 --> 29:32.248
to get back at me!

29:32.292 --> 29:33.467
Beckett loves me,

29:33.510 --> 29:35.948
and I love him
with all my heart!

29:35.991 --> 29:39.821
You cannot imagine
the power of our bond.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.476
We leave tomorrow
with the 20th Regiment.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.478
I choose my husband.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.220
[grunts]

29:47.263 --> 29:49.265
Then I hope you die
on the battlefield.

29:49.309 --> 29:53.052
And when your heart stops,
you'll realize I was right.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.097
[panting, groaning]

29:57.360 --> 30:00.276
This is the only memory which
Temperance herself appears in.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.496
This is what
the Burning Sorrows wants.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.413
[sobs]:
Make it stop!

30:06.456 --> 30:08.458
It's...

30:08.502 --> 30:10.417
The windows!

30:10.460 --> 30:13.246
We need to open the windows.
Give it everything we've got.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.382
Now!

30:22.298 --> 30:24.823
[wind rushing, growling]

30:25.911 --> 30:27.521
[screaming]

30:30.524 --> 30:33.396
[Temperance screams]

30:33.440 --> 30:34.441
Temperance?

30:34.484 --> 30:35.659
[gasping breath]
What...

30:35.703 --> 30:36.878
[gasps]

30:36.922 --> 30:38.488
BESS [whispers]:
Oh, my God.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.926
[shuddering]

30:56.593 --> 30:58.552
Matthew Burke had more to say.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.076
He just needed us
to speak for him.

31:03.557 --> 31:04.950
You hear me?

31:04.993 --> 31:06.560
RYAN:
No, no. Listen.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.998
I think the Archive Room Ghost
is trying to tell us something.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.957
I've been writing the pattern
down. Listen to this.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.350
[knocking]

31:14.394 --> 31:16.135
Six knocks, right?

31:16.178 --> 31:17.136
Wait.

31:17.179 --> 31:19.442
[knocking]

31:19.486 --> 31:21.662
There's eight knocks.

31:21.705 --> 31:25.231
[knocking]

31:25.274 --> 31:26.536
Ten knocks.Ten knocks.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.104
All right,
but here's the thing.

31:29.148 --> 31:32.716
Each one of these lines starts
with a one and a two.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.370
Right? But that could be 12.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.111
Right? I mean, that could be...
that could be a time,

31:36.155 --> 31:38.461
that could be a month--
December--

31:38.505 --> 31:39.854
it could be...Or...

31:39.898 --> 31:42.204
maybe the numbers
are times anddates.

31:42.248 --> 31:45.033
[snaps fingers]Like a time stamp
on footage.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.996
What was that
first one?Okay, so it's 12,

31:51.039 --> 31:53.215
11, nine,
four, three.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.521
[tapping keyboard]

31:58.046 --> 32:00.048
The caution tape
moved on its own,

32:00.092 --> 32:03.095
and the video
glitched.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.097
What's the next one?Uh, 12,

32:05.140 --> 32:07.360
six, nine,
five, five.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.665
[tapping keyboard]

32:12.539 --> 32:14.193
There it is.
Coaster moved; glitch.Mm-hmm.

32:14.236 --> 32:16.021
See? These things
have to be connected.

32:16.064 --> 32:17.065
All right, next one.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.372
12, six,
eight, ten.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.729
[whispers]:
Wow.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.992
There might be information
hidden in the glitches,

32:31.036 --> 32:32.951
but I need equipment
to work on it.

32:34.691 --> 32:38.782
[loudly]: Equipment that I
keep outside of this room.

32:38.826 --> 32:43.222
Definitely can't work on it
if I stay locked up in here.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.315
Hell yeah.

32:49.358 --> 32:52.057
We do have a feel
for these things.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.319
I just emailed you pics

32:53.362 --> 32:56.017
of Matthew Burke's
manic writing period.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.280
Hey, tell Nancy
I said hi.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.761
So, uh...
what's next?

33:00.804 --> 33:02.632
I need a laptop.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.199
I need some audio gear.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.332
I can drop you off
at your couch on the way.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.171
[sighs]

33:23.436 --> 33:26.656
You asked me where I was
when Trott had his stroke,

33:26.700 --> 33:30.617
and my answer
might have been incomplete.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.314
I know.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.664
You have a tell when
you're spinning a partial truth.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.450
What's my tell?

33:37.493 --> 33:39.365
Bet you can figure it out.

33:41.715 --> 33:44.152
Uh, am I still a suspect?

33:44.196 --> 33:46.633
You were never a suspect
in Trott's case.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.678
You don't fit the profile.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.724
Hmm.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.465
Temperance is awake.

33:53.292 --> 33:56.034
Told her you'd have
some questions for her.

33:58.471 --> 34:00.734
The Copperhead's first
victim, Matthew Burke,

34:00.777 --> 34:02.692
he had recurring
nightmares

34:02.736 --> 34:04.085
about the Battle
of Gettysburg.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.347
How is all this
connected?

34:05.391 --> 34:07.175
The pieces of Charity's soul

34:07.219 --> 34:11.397
have reincarnated separately
through the years.

34:13.486 --> 34:16.097
Only the Copperhead knows
how to find her now.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.491
I saw a symbol

34:18.534 --> 34:20.145
on Dow's uniform

34:20.188 --> 34:22.669
and the same one
on the Copperhead's.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.672
Is it possible that Beckett Dow
became the Copperhead?

34:25.715 --> 34:28.457
With the help
of his mother's rituals, yes.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.372
So why go after Charity now?

34:30.416 --> 34:32.200
The timing is no coincidence.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.507
TEMPERANCE:
Only days after

34:34.550 --> 34:36.726
I lowered the barrier
around Horseshoe Bay,

34:36.770 --> 34:39.425
the Copperhead began
killing anybody

34:39.468 --> 34:41.862
that carried a piece
of Charity's soul.

34:41.905 --> 34:44.212
Matthew Burke
and Jake Cazine.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.779
And when he's captured
all four pieces,

34:45.822 --> 34:48.260
he's going to destroy them...

34:48.303 --> 34:50.305
along with himself.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.525
So why not destroy the soul
back in 1863

34:52.568 --> 34:54.570
instead of splitting it apart?

34:54.614 --> 34:57.573
I do not know,
but I would have given anything

34:57.617 --> 35:01.795
just to touch those remnants
one... more time.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.365
[Temperance shuddering]

35:06.408 --> 35:07.714
Temperance, I know you said

35:07.757 --> 35:09.324
you didn't want to go
to a hospital...

35:09.368 --> 35:12.632
No hospital can help me.

35:12.675 --> 35:16.157
The Burning Sorrows has
corrupted my body

35:16.201 --> 35:17.550
down to the cellular level.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.378
Do you need more of my blood?

35:19.421 --> 35:20.466
No.

35:21.510 --> 35:23.860
I need new cells.

35:25.819 --> 35:28.604
I saved a lock
of my daughter's hair.

35:30.519 --> 35:34.523
And since my cells make up half
of her DNA,

35:34.567 --> 35:37.961
I can adapt
a regeneration ritual

35:38.005 --> 35:40.181
to renew
what's been corrupted.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.183
I'll help.Yeah.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.880
NANCY:
Yeah, we all will.I'm grateful

35:43.924 --> 35:47.493
for your kindness, but...

35:47.536 --> 35:49.843
I have to do this alone.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.760
Leave me.

36:08.514 --> 36:11.169
[sighs]
You couldn't
find him, either?

36:13.693 --> 36:15.695
I ran out of places to look.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.610
So we still need
each other.

36:17.653 --> 36:18.872
Hmm.

36:18.915 --> 36:20.439
Here's the truth.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.485
Yes, I was in Maine
three years ago.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.313
I was at a party
with Ned

36:25.357 --> 36:27.010
during his football
training camp.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.838
The party where Nick got
into a fight.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.536
He was protecting someone.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.494
He was protecting me.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.888
And he killed a man
in self-defense.

36:37.282 --> 36:38.370
I haven't talked to Ned since.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.849
He won't answer
any of my letters

36:39.893 --> 36:41.938
or take my calls.

36:41.982 --> 36:45.028
I texted when I found out
he got engaged, but no reply.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.509
I mean, I thought about
telling you when I met you,

36:47.553 --> 36:49.511
but "I'm the reason
Ned went to juvie"

36:49.555 --> 36:51.774
isn't exactly
first impression material.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.863
So I lied about who I was...

36:53.907 --> 36:57.040
or at least who I was to Ned.

36:57.084 --> 37:01.349
Besides, he shut off
that part of his life anyway.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.525
You know, that's not true.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.788
He did tell Addy and the kids
about his past.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.877
That whole walkabout thing.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.794
Maybe he did go on a walkabout.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.448
Is that the kind of
thing that he would do?

37:13.492 --> 37:14.667
Not exactly,

37:14.710 --> 37:16.364
but when he found himself
in his head,

37:16.408 --> 37:18.540
he had this way
of centering himself.

37:18.584 --> 37:19.976
What, like...

37:20.020 --> 37:21.717
like meditation?

37:21.761 --> 37:24.546
Not meditation
in the traditional sense, but...

37:25.591 --> 37:27.767
I know where he is.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.641
Well, I stand corrected--

37:32.685 --> 37:34.730
Temperance was capable
of heartbreak.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.471
Yeah, I mean, she lost...

37:36.515 --> 37:38.299
so much.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.388
That looks exactly
like the device

37:40.432 --> 37:42.564
from her Gettysburg
vision. Is...

37:42.608 --> 37:44.479
Yeah.TEMPERANCE:
I recognize it, too.

37:46.568 --> 37:48.440
Brings back memories
of your daughter.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.790
I think you should have it.

37:52.531 --> 37:55.534
You don't know
how much this means.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.579
Temperance?

37:57.623 --> 37:59.799
Yes.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.409
I'm still myself.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.020
PARK:
When you said regeneration

38:04.064 --> 38:06.719
from Charity's cells,
you meant that literally?

38:10.113 --> 38:13.856
NANCY:
Did you know this would happen?

38:13.900 --> 38:16.598
I knew it was possible,
I just...

38:16.642 --> 38:18.600
And I am content.

38:19.558 --> 38:23.649
I've yearned to see
my daughter's face again.

38:29.002 --> 38:32.397
EVE:
This is where he had
football camp.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.834
It's the last field
he played on.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.620
Before everything changed.

38:41.536 --> 38:44.583
Thank you for
helping me find him.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.976
Likewise.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.500
Coming?

38:49.544 --> 38:51.459
No. You go.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.635
You guys have a lot
to catch up on.

39:10.696 --> 39:13.351
EVE:
Hey, Neddington.

39:16.528 --> 39:17.964
What are you doing here?

39:18.007 --> 39:20.836
Visiting you, obviously.

39:22.882 --> 39:25.667
You come all the way
from Florida?

39:25.711 --> 39:27.495
I'm at UVA now.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.497
Virginia?Mm-hmm.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.978
Wow. That's, um...

39:32.021 --> 39:33.849
that's great.

39:33.893 --> 39:36.852
I met George. I like her a lot.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.377
Your life seems
really good here.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.427
I'm sorry.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.690
About everything.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.824
Yeah, I should have returned
your calls, but, um...

39:51.867 --> 39:54.522
I just wasn't ready to...I'm not here

39:54.566 --> 39:57.003
to talk about us or the past.

39:57.046 --> 39:59.745
I'm here
because I need your help.

40:03.749 --> 40:06.055
I think I killed someone.

40:06.099 --> 40:09.450
â™ª Trust no one...

40:09.494 --> 40:12.714
To the Archive Room Ghost,
whoever you are:

40:12.758 --> 40:16.109
Your story doesn't have to end
just because you're gone,

40:16.152 --> 40:18.198
and I'd really be honored
to help you tell it.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.983
Maybe that's my calling.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.985
[keyboard clacking]

40:25.248 --> 40:28.034
[distorted static]

40:28.077 --> 40:30.471
WHISPERED VOICE:
Die.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.822
Die. Die.

40:33.866 --> 40:36.477
Die.â™ª Nothing's ever what it seems

40:36.521 --> 40:38.044
Die.

40:39.088 --> 40:40.699
[fading]:
Die.

40:43.615 --> 40:45.094
TEMPERANCE:
Dear daughter,

40:45.138 --> 40:47.009
I made real progress today.

40:47.053 --> 40:51.231
It started when Bess proposed
setting a mystical trap.

40:51.274 --> 40:53.233
I let her think my charm

40:53.276 --> 40:55.583
would bait the Copperhead.

40:55.627 --> 40:58.151
I made it easy for her to steal.

40:59.152 --> 41:02.634
She thought they trapped
the Burning Sorrows by mistake.

41:02.677 --> 41:05.985
But I designed that charm
to awaken the Burning Sorrows.

41:06.028 --> 41:09.902
I made sure
I was the one it burned.

41:09.945 --> 41:12.078
I showed my heartbreaks
and risked my life

41:12.121 --> 41:14.994
as a way to get Nancy
to trust me.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.996
Her place
in the Hudson bloodline

41:17.039 --> 41:18.998
is the key to getting you back.

41:19.041 --> 41:22.610
Despite all that the Women
in White did to keep us apart,

41:22.654 --> 41:25.787
we will soon be one in spirit,

41:25.831 --> 41:28.137
as well as in body,

41:28.181 --> 41:31.053
and then we'll finish
the work we started.

41:31.097 --> 41:33.621
â™ª What it seems

41:36.363 --> 41:39.061
â™ª You've gone insane

41:40.846 --> 41:43.979
â™ª Nothing's ever what it

41:46.025 --> 41:47.896
â™ª Seems.
