WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:02.240
           Previously...

00:02.240 --> 00:04.000
          Doctor of the Year, twice.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.240
Ever been
Doctor of the Year?

00:06.240 --> 00:10.240
Taking anyone
to the awards?
I'm going stag.
Not this time.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.400
Who's going
to make the cut?
A lot new faces next Fall.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.560
Be a paramedic.
I don't want to.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.760
You could become
my assistant.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.880
You'd do that
for me?

00:21.880 --> 00:23.080
You all right?

00:23.080 --> 00:24.760
It's the chemotherapy.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.760
I'm falling
in love with you.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.640
Take it easy.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.080
Ehrlich,
head laceration.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.880
Heavy blood loss.
Vitals stable.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.440
You on a quota
system today?

02:06.440 --> 02:10.440
Cubicle three.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.880
Please hold still,
Mr Notarius.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.600
Dr Auschlander
okayed me

02:26.600 --> 02:29.120
for 24 hours
of ER Training.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.360
Where do I start?
Keep pressure
on the wound.

02:32.360 --> 02:36.360
If this place
scares you, don't look around.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.840
I'll get
an  admissions form.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.120
What happened?

02:47.120 --> 02:48.920
I'm at this bar.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.640
This broad
brings me a beer.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.200
I pay her,
and she stands there.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.360
I said,
"What do you want?"

02:57.360 --> 02:59.640
She says,
"A simple thank you."

02:59.640 --> 03:02.000
I say,
"You're not my mom."

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Next thing my septum's
floating in my draught.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.840
45-year-old man.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.160
Went into V-tach.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.160
Clear out
cubicle two.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.640
Andele, Luther.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.040
What about
this patient?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.080
Relief right there.
100mg  lidocaine.

03:28.080 --> 03:32.080
I'll intubate him.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.920
Hey, hurry up!

03:37.920 --> 03:41.640
Muggers know when
welfare cheques  arrive.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.600
They wait for people
to cash them.
They took  my food money.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.680
And left this
lump on my head.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.240
We're taking cases
in order of severity.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.280
If you don't mind
waiting.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.320
I'm used to waiting.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.920
I'm always behind
New York, Philly,
Los Angeles

03:58.920 --> 04:00.200
for Federal funding.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.040
I'll sit down.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.240
You will
call my name?

04:05.240 --> 04:06.720
Soon as possible, Mr...?

04:06.720 --> 04:10.160
Massachusetts.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.920
Boston Massachusetts.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.600
I think my people

04:13.600 --> 04:17.600
would have
more respect
for their city.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.480
You're going
to the awards
with Westphall?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.360
It's no big deal.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.720
I thought Ehrlich
was a brown-noser.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.120
We're
just friends.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.600
Right.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.520
The gossip's
started already.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.920
You did
the smart thing.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.320
More
apple-polishing,

04:41.320 --> 04:43.280
and I'd get
third-year.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.640
I can't watch
another one
die today.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.080
Me, neither.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.440
Somebody
order a pizza?

04:51.440 --> 04:55.280
Hang on a second.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.640
Who ordered
Original Sal's
original bari pizza?

04:58.640 --> 05:01.040
Lire's in
the back pocket.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.920
Any sign
of a heartbeat?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.320
Not yet.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.200
These nostrils better
smell the difference

05:08.200 --> 05:11.080
between my pits
and Chanel No 5,

05:11.080 --> 05:15.080
or you're looking
down the barrel
of a malpractice suit.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.760
Here's a prescription
for the pain.

05:18.760 --> 05:22.600
So long, feedbag.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.640
Hey!

05:23.640 --> 05:25.360
What's the problem?

05:25.360 --> 05:27.200
Aren't you
forgetting something?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.520
What about a "thank you"?

05:29.520 --> 05:31.520
You're not my mom.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.480
I cleaned you up.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.200
All I want is a "thank you",
please.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.360
I wouldn't
mean it.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.200
Besides,
you get paid
for this.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.080
Would you like me
to break your beak?

05:46.080 --> 05:50.080
You're sick.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.240
Hand me the paddles.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.200
Dr Ehrlich.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.480
Not now.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.080
But...

05:58.080 --> 06:00.880
Ready?

06:00.880 --> 06:03.120
Didn't know
he was loaded.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.120
He's wearing
a nitroglycerin
skin patch for angina.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.920
Electrically
detonated
when I defibed.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.440
He'll be OK?

06:11.440 --> 06:14.840
A little
purple nerple
on the nipple.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.840
Let's get him
stabilized.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.760
Ellen?

06:26.920 --> 06:30.920
Holy moly.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.080
You're home early.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.480
Why are
the windows open?

06:37.480 --> 06:41.320
I air the house out
in the afternoon.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.160
You're lucky
no-one cleaned
the place out.

06:45.160 --> 06:49.000
Not that that would
be a bad idea.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.400
How's the baby?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.840
She's fine.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.800
Barbara eats
at 3:00.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.640
Then we go
for a walk.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.000
Then hopefully
she sleeps
for 45 minutes.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.960
I'll do the same.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.960
Your tux
is pressed.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.440
What about that mess
in the kitchen?

07:09.440 --> 07:12.840
Let me get Barbara
to bed first.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.240
Oh, brother.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.200
At least
the mechanic

07:16.200 --> 07:18.560
has my car
working well.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.400
I hate this Doctor
of the Year malarky.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.400
Maybe you'll win
this year.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.880
Mark?

07:39.640 --> 07:42.560
I'm not finished
with that vacuum.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.440
What about your nap?

07:44.440 --> 07:47.360
Not if you're
going to vacuum.

07:47.360 --> 07:51.360
This house looks like
the day after the day after.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.960
Everything
gets put away
before you get home.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.800
My schedule and I
get along just fine.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.640
I just wish
tonight were over.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.040
Every year,
the women's auxiliary

08:05.040 --> 08:07.960
puts us through
this torture session.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.360
Fundraiser?
More like hair-raiser.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.240
One guy's a winner,

08:12.240 --> 08:16.120
and the rest of us
look like jackasses.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.520
I'll do these.
You're tense.

08:18.520 --> 08:19.960
No, I'm not!

08:19.960 --> 08:21.400
You're not?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.320
Donald will win
anyway.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.680
He's won
two years running.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.080
With this Ethiopia
hanky-wringer,

08:28.080 --> 08:32.080
why don't we just
give him the damn
thing for good?

08:33.159 --> 08:36.240
Doctor
of the millennium.

08:36.240 --> 08:40.080
How long will
our sidewalk
be torn up?

08:40.080 --> 08:42.000
Until the sewer's
repaired.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.840
You forgot your John Hancock
on these forms.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.280
Are you OK?

08:47.280 --> 08:48.720
Allergies.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.120
Wish the awards
weren't tonight.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.400
I'm looking forward
to it myself.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.160
Should be
more organized

08:56.160 --> 08:58.920
with Katherine
as head of the auxiliary.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.320
Tonight's
the last night

09:01.320 --> 09:04.200
that Halley's comet
will be visible.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.120
It's supposed
to rain.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.640
I was born
during Halley's
last visit. 1910.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.840
Certainly
won't live to see
the next pass.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.840
The comet holds
a certain fascination over me.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.440
Just as it shone over
my beginning,

09:19.440 --> 09:21.040
it will shine
over the end.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.920
I think I forgot
something upstairs.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.360
Dr Westphall.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.720
Any word on
who's being asked back?

09:28.720 --> 09:30.520
List goes up
tomorrow morning.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.520
I love this
fine institution.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.960
OK.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.840
I've been reviewing
my funeral plans.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.920
I'd like you to be
a pallbearer.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.560
I'll need a truss.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.000
You're in one
of those moods.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.920
I have to go
back upstairs.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.920
I'll see you
at the dinner.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.120
I got this lump
on my head.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.760
The pain's getting worse
cos of the smog.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.960
Smog?

10:07.960 --> 10:11.960
It's the price I pay
for my industry.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.680
People in cars,
jets with arrivals.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.440
My name's
Boston Massachusetts.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.320
Have you seen Elliot?

10:21.320 --> 10:23.720
He's in
the exam rooms.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.000
This is Boston
Massachusetts.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.040
Where did you
think we were, Altoona?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.520
Elliot, what's wrong?

10:28.520 --> 10:29.760
Me.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.880
Defective thalamus?
What are we talking about?

10:32.880 --> 10:35.520
I can't take
the pressure.

10:35.520 --> 10:39.120
You've got
the national boards
tonight, don't you?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.960
We're all in
the same boat.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.720
Nobody knows who's
hitting the road.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.120
What are
the breech positions?

10:47.120 --> 10:50.320
It's not the test.
That's easy.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.280
Life is hard.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.000
I yelled
at a patient today.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.080
So?

10:56.080 --> 10:59.640
I threatened
to punch him
in the nose.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.160
I used to be nice.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.760
I've become
cold and cynical.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.160
Getting calluses
on your optimism

11:07.160 --> 11:10.040
is part of becoming
a doctor.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.960
I never
yelled before.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.360
I was considerate.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.360
There's nothing wrong
with letting out
the primal scream,

11:17.720 --> 11:21.720
otherwise you'll
always do things
you never wanted to.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.680
Nobody will
like me.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.960
You used to be sweet,

11:25.960 --> 11:27.400
took everything
personally.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.480
Nobody respected you.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.680
Now you're fighting back
like David Horowitz.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.160
I hate myself.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.000
Concentrate
on the boards.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
If I hate myself,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.640
who cares
about passing?

11:38.640 --> 11:42.560
A patient with gas
waiting in the ward.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.560
I'm hitting
the litterbox.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.040
Hi, Helen.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.440
This came for you
upstairs.

11:54.440 --> 11:58.440
Yank a nose hair?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.000
What's that?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.400
A letter from
Josiah Bartlett,

12:07.400 --> 12:10.240
Chief of Surgery
at Boston General.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.680
He's inviting me

12:11.680 --> 12:15.520
to join their
third-year surgical
residency program.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.520
So long, Elliot.

12:27.400 --> 12:31.000
When Halley's
last appeared
in 1910,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.920
people flocked
to churches,

12:32.920 --> 12:35.320
bought real estate
in heaven,

12:35.320 --> 12:37.720
took anti-comet
pills.

12:37.720 --> 12:41.720
And Mark Twain...

12:45.160 --> 12:49.160
I love holding you.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.480
I just know
everyone's
staring at us.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
(BEEPING)

13:03.680 --> 13:05.600
The comet's
been regarded

13:05.600 --> 13:08.000
as a harbinger
of death.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.920
How about a dance?

13:09.920 --> 13:12.320
I was getting
into Halley's.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.720
Don't let us
keep you.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.120
Go rumba
with your wife.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.120
I shall return.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.240
I hate waiting.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.680
Could be worse.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.080
You could be
a bus boy.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.840
Nervous about third year?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.920
If I think
about it,

13:32.920 --> 13:36.760
I'll heave
those ho-hos
I had for lunch.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.200
You two together?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.440
No. Robert hates
hospital functions.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.840
Roxanne's having
triplets...

13:42.840 --> 13:44.280
Mrs Schwartzman's.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.200
Richard's out of town.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.120
Too bad, isn't it?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.520
We work hard all year,

13:50.520 --> 13:54.200
then we finally
get a chance to celebrate,

13:54.200 --> 13:55.640
and we're alone.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.400
I did so want to dance.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.000
Oh, yeah, uh...

14:01.000 --> 14:03.600
Oh, great!
I'd love to.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.600
Do you frug?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.880
I already bought cookies.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.320
Excuse me.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.320
Maybe the next dance.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.000
Call Mort's Deli.
Tell them Wayne's usual.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.320
Lean pastrami,
half-pound chopped
chicken liver?

14:24.320 --> 14:26.720
And two bromos.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.600
You'll be late
for the boards.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.000
Big deal.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.440
What's Colles' fracture?

14:32.440 --> 14:34.840
Lower end
of the radius.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.800
Right.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.240
Wayne, let's talk.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.280
Lester Alexander.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.680
You're
Mr Alexander?

14:41.680 --> 14:43.120
No, I'm not.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.480
I don't mean
to cause any trouble.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.400
But after six hours,

14:48.400 --> 14:51.400
I'm getting
a little dizzy.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.280
Hang in there, pops.

14:53.280 --> 14:57.120
My head feels
like the 4th of July.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.800
Maybe I'll just
get some water.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.400
I'm rated very high
on drinking water quality.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.360
Fountain's
on your left.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.400
Yeah.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.920
OK.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.800
Cubicle two,
Mr Alexander.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.240
Wayne, Wayne.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.120
It's about
my career.

15:13.120 --> 15:16.040
You think
you're the only one

15:16.040 --> 15:19.400
worried about
being cut from
the residency?

15:19.400 --> 15:23.240
I've been rattling
Westphall's cage
all year long.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.120
What's behind this door?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.440
I've never
seen it open.

15:27.440 --> 15:31.440
Neither have I.
I'll find the key.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.720
Yeah.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.240
Boston.
Boston Massachusetts.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.520
Medford, Somerville...

15:39.520 --> 15:43.240
Burlington.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.320
OK.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.680
Rick Kaplan.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.200
Mr Kaplan,

15:48.200 --> 15:52.200
would you step
into cubicle three?

15:59.240 --> 16:03.080
You need a blood,
urine, and stool sample.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.000
Just take my shorts.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.440
That's disgusting, man.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.160
Get out of here.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.720
You think I'm paying
workmen's comp

16:10.720 --> 16:12.640
cos of your stupidity?

16:12.640 --> 16:15.520
There's nothing wrong
with your neck!

16:15.520 --> 16:19.520
Leave him alone!

16:21.000 --> 16:22.920
Get me some ice.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.920
And some bourbon.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.960
Wayne. Wayne.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.960
Boston General wants me
to join their surgical program.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.160
Probably just
a maintenance shaft.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.120
Well?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.080
What?

16:38.080 --> 16:41.440
This could open
new doors for me.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.360
Maybe it's a vault.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.240
On the other hand,

16:45.240 --> 16:48.120
If I stay here
I'm safe.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.040
A safe in ER?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.440
Oh, great.
My shift's over.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.480
So go.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.160
You think I should?

16:55.160 --> 16:57.720
Why would
you hang around here?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.720
I better ask Craig.

16:59.720 --> 17:03.720
Ok, but I usually
just punch out.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.800
Ellen and Mark
had car trouble.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.680
Is the weather
inclement?

17:24.680 --> 17:26.599
The umbrellas
weren't wet.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.520
Can I snooker Donald?

17:28.520 --> 17:30.920
He doesn't need
my permission.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.800
My final
opportunity
to view Halley's.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.200
I went to
the observatory
last December.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.080
I couldn't see diddly.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.000
If the clouds
haven't moved in,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.840
the comet should
still be visible.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.240
I'll call
the weather bureau.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.680
I don't know.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.600
Maybe I
shouldn't worry.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.480
The programme
needs blacks.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.960
And women.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.400
Right.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.800
Feel better?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.200
No.

17:59.200 --> 18:03.200
Me, either.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.320
Mr Massachusetts?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.760
Boston
Massachusetts?

18:10.760 --> 18:12.640
That's me.
Finally.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.080
Here for a little
urban renewal?

18:15.080 --> 18:16.120
No, just my head.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.960
Although my heart's
a little weak.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.680
Help here.
He needs help.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.600
Just have a seat.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.600
Kid's OD'd.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.000
All right, uh...

18:28.000 --> 18:30.400
Bring him here.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.840
He's the one!

18:31.840 --> 18:35.720
He stole my welfare
cheque and hit me.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.600
Wait. You're not
taking him first.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.000
Get out
of the way.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
That kid beat me up!

18:46.240 --> 18:50.120
Luther,
get vitals. Put
him on a monitor.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.440
Start
a line - D5W TKO.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.400
Can you hear me?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.480
Blood and urine
to toxicology.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.360
Pulse 100,
respiration 10.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.840
What's he on?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.800
He said he was  the Silver Surfer.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.200
BP 90 over 60.

19:05.200 --> 19:09.200
Insert that IV.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.200
I hope he dies!

19:16.200 --> 19:18.600
Take care of me first!

19:18.600 --> 19:20.440
Let go of him.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.360
Just lie down.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.760
Get him
out of here.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.600
Go on.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.160
I'd like my fellow members
of the women's auxiliary

19:33.160 --> 19:37.160
to stand and receive
the recognition they deserve.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.200
Hi.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.120
Victor.
Underdressed,
aren't you?

19:50.120 --> 19:52.520
Pow-wow with Dr Craig.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.960
He didn't show.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.880
My friend was invited

19:55.880 --> 19:59.240
to do third year
at Boston General.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.120
You're going
to BG?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.560
Accept it.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.480
This is dragging on.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.840
I'll be late
for my ER shift.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.240
Could you swing
by Craig's?

20:10.240 --> 20:14.240
If you pay
the valet parking.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.400
And finally, it's time
to present the award

20:18.400 --> 20:21.480
to our Doctor of the Year.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.680
For his many years
of service,

20:24.680 --> 20:27.680
for his elevation
of medical care here,

20:27.680 --> 20:31.680
and for his ability
to turn out fine residents,

20:32.680 --> 20:34.560
the women's auxiliary
committee

20:34.560 --> 20:37.440
are proud to present
this plaque

20:37.440 --> 20:41.120
to St Eligius'
Doctor of the Year...

20:41.120 --> 20:45.120
Mark Craig.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.800
Mark is absent,
but accepting his award

20:53.800 --> 20:57.800
is last year's winner,
Donald Westphall.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.240
I promise this speech

21:10.240 --> 21:13.000
will be like
Mark Craig himself -

21:13.000 --> 21:16.840
short and to the point.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.680
Mark is unlike most of us,

21:19.680 --> 21:22.680
and many people
don't like him.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.520
I've realized that what
gets under our skin

21:26.520 --> 21:30.520
is his desire for perfection
in all of us

21:30.840 --> 21:32.800
and especially in himself.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.800
He challenges us
to be our best and to care.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.040
Isn't this great?

21:39.040 --> 21:40.080
Mh-hmm.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.920
If there's anything
wrong with him,

21:42.920 --> 21:45.440
he probably
cares too much.

21:45.440 --> 21:48.160
To my friend, Mark Craig.

21:48.160 --> 21:52.160
Mark Craig.
Mark Craig.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.320
Chico cracks my pinata.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.720
That bandito had
my car all week.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.120
I'll have
you there soon.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.040
You've passed
three stations!

22:08.040 --> 22:09.920
Your club
membership
expired.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.200
You didn't try
to find the problem.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.160
It's your fault,
Ellen.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.080
No repairs
without
a club card.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.520
What's his function?

22:19.520 --> 22:21.440
Hal watches
the dog.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.880
How much further?

22:22.880 --> 22:26.720
I promised Hal
I'd stop for
a Gaines-Burger.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.960
That's it!
Take us home!

22:28.960 --> 22:30.720
What about
the awards?

22:30.720 --> 22:33.560
Those biddies make
us dress formally.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.960
We end up
with the beagle boys.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.880
The plaque doesn't matter.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.160
Turn around!

22:40.160 --> 22:41.560
It'll
cost you.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.040
Yeah, I know!

22:43.040 --> 22:46.360
Get us out
of this neighbourhood alive.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.480
(SNIFFS)

22:47.480 --> 22:50.840
That better have been
the dog, Hal!

22:50.840 --> 22:54.840
Ellen, get the window.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.840
What's the matter?

23:09.840 --> 23:12.040
I lost.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.640
Well, not
necessarily, honey.

23:15.640 --> 23:19.640
Someone would have
called by now.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.840
(DOORBELL RINGS)

23:28.880 --> 23:31.280
Hello.
Sorry to bother you.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.880
I'll be brief.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.800
Why are you here?

23:34.800 --> 23:37.680
I got this
from Boston General.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.680
Yeah.
Josiah Bartlett called.

23:44.400 --> 23:48.400
Glass of milk.
Great. I'd love one.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.640
Look!
Sylvester and Tweety.

23:50.640 --> 23:54.640
If you've got
something to say,
spit it out.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.840
First, swallow
your milk.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.760
I can't keep this.

23:58.760 --> 24:02.760
The Domedion-Craig
gerbode mitral
valvulotome.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.600
I've considered
Bartlett's offer.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.600
Before the list
goes up tomorrow,
scratch my name

24:11.320 --> 24:14.640
so another surgical
resident can have my spot.

24:14.640 --> 24:18.600
I'd like to give
you my reasons.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.960
Boston General's
high reputation
speaks for itself.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.520
Only a moron would
turn it down.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.920
Since examining
your wife's genitalia,

24:27.920 --> 24:30.840
I've thought
you'd hold it against me.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.280
Don't be silly.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.680
You're asking me
to stay?

24:34.680 --> 24:37.200
Nobody appreciates
a good surgeon
at St Eligius.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.680
I should go?

24:38.680 --> 24:40.120
Yes. And hurry.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.080
Right.
I'm being hasty.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.880
T-minus 30 seconds
and counting.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.200
This hospital is
my first real home.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.600
Nobody appreciated me
or cared.

24:50.600 --> 24:54.480
Then you took me
under your noble wing,

24:54.480 --> 24:58.280
like Philip of Macedon
and Alexander the Great,

24:58.280 --> 25:01.120
John Adams
and his son, Quincy.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.040
Burt Bacharach
and Carole Bayer Sager.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.920
I've changed my mind.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.760
Can you keep me
on that list, huh?

25:09.760 --> 25:12.160
I never
said you were.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.120
What?

25:13.120 --> 25:15.960
Could I have
the valvulotome back?

25:15.960 --> 25:19.960
Goodbye.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.960
Who'd lock a door
and throw away the key?

25:29.280 --> 25:31.200
Jay and the Americans.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.080
Mistletoe
from last Christmas.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.920
Graveyard. 2:30.
I hate this shift.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.680
Hardly any patients.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.280
That's
the attraction.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.680
I need
something to do.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.640
Take over my dream.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.320
'84 Olympics.
I'm running a marathon.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.160
Alberto Salazar
passes me, looks back.

25:51.160 --> 25:55.080
He says, "Come on, Phil,
time's a-wasting."

25:55.080 --> 25:57.960
But the Coliseum gates
are locked.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.400
I couldn't finish.

25:59.400 --> 26:03.400
The old failure dream.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
(SPEAKS CHINESE)

26:20.600 --> 26:22.560
2:30,
Chinese dentist time.

26:22.560 --> 26:26.560
Here's your food,
Dr Chandler.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.400
Hello, Phil.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.720
Cathy...

26:32.720 --> 26:34.640
Where have you been?

26:34.640 --> 26:38.640
Out to lunch.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.560
You won't believe
who I saw.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.840
Cathy Martin.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.840
Go back to sleep.
You're dreaming.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.760
This will open
with dynamite.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.160
What's so important
about it?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.920
Aren't you curious?

26:55.920 --> 26:58.400
Only about
tomorrow's list.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.480
Know why?

26:59.480 --> 27:01.880
We want
to be MDs.

27:01.880 --> 27:05.280
If we get dumped,
we lose our fix.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.600
I'm an ER junkie.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.200
I meet rich, poor,
young, and old.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.080
People - always
unpredictable,
exciting.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.120
Other medicine is
a graveyard shift.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.560
Maybe to you.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.960
What motivates
and challenges you?

27:17.960 --> 27:20.840
What's
behind this door?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.240
Foxtrotting's
far from my days

27:23.240 --> 27:24.680
in go-go boots.

27:24.680 --> 27:28.520
Dancing is
the best thing
from our generation.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.880
We could get
close to a woman.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.800
Your generation
changed that.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.160
Sexual freedom was one
of our achievements.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.560
What is it
about hotels?

27:39.560 --> 27:41.920
Freedom!
OK to cut loose.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.360
Big beds.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.800
Big bathtubs.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.080
Room service.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.000
"Do not disturb" signs.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.480
They're
probably booked.

27:49.480 --> 27:53.480
Doesn't hurt to ask.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.000
Sure you want to?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.400
No. But why not?

28:02.400 --> 28:03.360
Hi.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.680
Good evening.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.920
A room.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.680
Certainly, sir.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.560
Doctor of the Year?

28:10.560 --> 28:12.000
Congratulations,
Dr Craig.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.920
It's nothing,
really.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.920
We're always pleased
to host people
from St Eligius.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.920
How would
you like to pay?

28:20.920 --> 28:24.320
Send me the bill
at the hospital.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.720
Yes, Dr Craig.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.720
Front!

28:34.240 --> 28:35.680
See your comet?

28:35.680 --> 28:38.520
Faintly.
Light pollution
from the city

28:38.520 --> 28:39.960
blurs the view.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.360
Here,
dead centre.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.760
I'm so terrible
with instruments.

28:44.760 --> 28:48.680
Never found
a single amoeba
in biology.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.080
I don't see a thing.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.520
When beggars die,

28:52.520 --> 28:54.920
there are
no comets seen.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.320
The heavens themselves

28:56.320 --> 28:59.240
Blaze forth
the death of princes.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.120
Come inside.
It's late.

29:01.120 --> 29:04.520
Tens of thousands
of miles into space,

29:04.520 --> 29:08.520
returning every
76 years or so.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.840
I came into the world
with Halley's.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.160
Katherine, I'm afraid
to go to sleep.

29:16.160 --> 29:20.160
My premonition is that
when Halley's leaves,
I'll die.

29:20.320 --> 29:23.040
It's that
amaretto and cream.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.360
We measure time
by the sun and moon.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.320
Why not a comet?

29:28.320 --> 29:31.680
Ever since
your liver cancer
was diagnosed,

29:31.680 --> 29:35.680
you've gone
from one mystical
delusion to another.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.640
Get on with your life.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.040
Dying takes
care of itself.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.080
Cancer won't get you.
Pneumonia will.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.920
During a man's life,
he cultivates

29:46.920 --> 29:50.320
friendships and
pleasures he cares
about deeply.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.240
Nature takes
them away.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.240
Her way of preparing
us for death.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.000
Oh, my God!

30:05.000 --> 30:06.920
Has the comet gone?

30:06.920 --> 30:09.800
The Havenhursts
are slugging
each other.

30:09.800 --> 30:13.800
Move over.

30:16.440 --> 30:20.440
Do you mind?

30:25.520 --> 30:28.360
About time.
What have you got?

30:28.360 --> 30:31.240
Where's the head?
Bad Chinese food.

30:31.240 --> 30:35.240
Where did you buy
that Chinese food?

30:38.440 --> 30:40.840
Hey, uh...
how's that kid?

30:40.840 --> 30:44.200
The one that
the cop brought in.

30:44.200 --> 30:48.040
His kidneys are shot
from all the dope.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.440
He'll probably
need new ones.

30:50.440 --> 30:54.440
That's too bad.

30:54.760 --> 30:58.600
Now that I have
this seat belt law,

30:58.600 --> 31:01.440
fewer people die
in car accidents.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.840
That means fewer
organ donors.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.280
Being a paramedic,

31:05.280 --> 31:07.680
you drive
to the accident,

31:07.680 --> 31:11.520
scoop up the pieces,
and drop them off.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.880
You only see people
when they're screaming.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.640
Like that kid.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.480
I haven't always been
a very good city.

31:20.480 --> 31:24.000
You know,
political corruption
and race riots.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.880
I tried to do my share.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.800
I provided playgrounds
and parks,

31:29.800 --> 31:31.680
public schools
and hospitals,

31:31.680 --> 31:33.600
and the swan boats.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.440
All I asked
of the people

31:36.440 --> 31:40.200
was that they care
for one another.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.240
And didn't litter.

31:41.240 --> 31:45.080
Well, there's always
more that you can do,

31:45.080 --> 31:48.000
no matter how
tired you are.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.360
I better get
back to it.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.760
More.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.640
He's right.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.040
Sleep tight,
Barbara.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.400
Did the baby
wake you up, too?

32:02.400 --> 32:04.280
Yeah, well...

32:04.280 --> 32:07.520
Couldn't sleep anyway.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.920
I'm sorry
you lost, honey.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.920
Donald's probably
tacking that thing up
in his office now.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.520
Boy, the way he shows
those plaques off.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.520
It's just
a stupid award.

32:29.080 --> 32:32.440
At least I spared
myself the ordeal

32:32.440 --> 32:34.440
of putting on
a good face.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.400
I hate losing.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.280
Doctor of the Year,

32:38.280 --> 32:41.160
Ivy League
boxing championships,

32:41.160 --> 32:43.040
Penn debate team.

32:43.040 --> 32:47.040
You won the
Cushing left anterior
descending artery award.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.320
That was years ago.

32:49.320 --> 32:53.320
No one except Donald
even came to the luncheon.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.800
I've given everything
I had to my profession.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.920
I'm the best
at what I do.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.280
That should
be enough.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.840
It's not, damn it!

33:04.840 --> 33:08.200
Do you know
what life is like

33:08.200 --> 33:10.440
knowing you're not
well-liked?

33:10.440 --> 33:11.680
Even you.

33:11.680 --> 33:15.680
I don't have
to like you.
I love you.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.280
Why should you?

33:17.280 --> 33:18.720
Who am I?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.640
What have I become?

33:20.640 --> 33:22.080
I hate it.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.920
I hate it!

33:23.920 --> 33:25.600
Mark!

33:25.600 --> 33:28.480
What did you do
to yourself?

33:28.480 --> 33:32.160
I'm all right.

33:32.160 --> 33:36.160
Oh, my God. My hand.

33:40.400 --> 33:44.400
Oh!

33:57.960 --> 33:59.400
Beautiful woman.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.840
Oh...

34:00.840 --> 34:03.240
You know,
I realize now

34:03.240 --> 34:06.120
what I was
feeling last night.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.560
Yeah, I know.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.440
It caught me
by surprise, too.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.360
For the first time,

34:12.360 --> 34:15.239
I wasn't thinking
about Tommy, Lizzie,

34:15.239 --> 34:19.239
or some patient
screaming in the night.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.880
I felt very happy
without the guilt.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.880
I've always lived
for the kids and my work.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.080
At parties,
I always felt odd,

34:30.080 --> 34:34.080
Like there was plastic
between me and the world.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.760
I thought that was
a masculine trait.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.600
Mysterious,
like you knew
a secret we didn't.

34:41.600 --> 34:45.440
The secret is
I was looking
for something

34:45.440 --> 34:47.840
that kept getting
further away.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.120
What?

34:49.120 --> 34:50.400
Myself.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.679
Ah...

34:51.679 --> 34:55.000
I wasn't looking
in the right places.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.400
This will be a mess.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.800
People are already
buzzing around...

34:59.800 --> 35:03.160
Why can't we have
something we want,

35:03.160 --> 35:07.160
instead of worrying
about other people?

35:08.440 --> 35:12.280
What if you're afraid
of what you want?

35:12.280 --> 35:15.640
Or if you want
a lot of things,

35:15.640 --> 35:18.040
and everything's
at cross-purposes?

35:18.040 --> 35:22.040
Call room service,
I guess.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.800
It won't open?

35:32.800 --> 35:36.800
You said he was
a good second-story man.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.800
Need any help?

35:39.800 --> 35:41.720
Oh, no. I'm fine.

35:41.720 --> 35:45.720
Glad somebody is.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.000
Here you go.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.600
Could you take
the next one?

35:54.600 --> 35:56.800
Why should I?

35:56.800 --> 36:00.800
Because I asked.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.520
Is something wrong?

36:04.520 --> 36:08.520
The 3rd-year list
comes out in 20 minutes.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.360
No.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.720
Why not?

36:12.720 --> 36:15.880
I don't want
to do your job.

36:15.880 --> 36:19.200
I have to learn
to say no.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.120
Thanks a lot, Elliot(!)

36:21.120 --> 36:25.120
You're supposed
to like me better.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.080
Remember me?

36:34.080 --> 36:37.440
Oh, yeah.

36:37.440 --> 36:41.440
For a city,
I haven't always been
a good human being.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.640
I spent my whole life

36:44.640 --> 36:47.960
avoiding doing
anything for anybody.

36:47.960 --> 36:51.840
Trouble would come,
I'd step to the left,

36:51.840 --> 36:54.720
And whooo,
it'd blow right by.

36:54.720 --> 36:58.520
I was always pretty
quick on my feet.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.960
The truth is,

36:59.960 --> 37:02.880
I really shouldn't
be on welfare.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.280
I steal
from the Government,

37:05.280 --> 37:07.920
and the kid
steals from me.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.400
It isn't right.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.880
Maybe...

37:10.880 --> 37:14.880
Maybe the chain
can be reversed.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.440
You'll make
the cut.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.840
Yeah? What if I don't?

37:22.840 --> 37:24.280
Fiscus asked me

37:24.280 --> 37:27.120
what motivates me
to practise medicine.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.600
I'll tell you.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.480
My old man
struggled for success

37:31.480 --> 37:35.120
to prove a black man
could make it.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.920
To pay him back,

37:36.920 --> 37:39.760
his son had
to become a doctor.

37:39.760 --> 37:43.120
You're doing this
to please your dad?

37:43.120 --> 37:46.960
Saving a life
has never been
as important

37:46.960 --> 37:50.800
as being the guy
who could do it.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.800
I've been trying
to beat my dad
at his own game.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.040
Pretty weird, huh?

37:57.040 --> 37:59.440
I'll take
the next patient.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.880
Nah, he's mine.

38:00.880 --> 38:04.880
But thanks, anyway.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
You're welcome.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.240
I'm sorry to keep
bothering you.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.960
I'd like to make
a donation.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.520
We can use
the money.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.880
Give my kidneys
to that boy upstairs.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.760
And my eyes
for City Hall,

38:26.760 --> 38:29.920
and my liver for public works
and my heart for the Celtics.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.920
Most of that is
pretty impossible
until you're dead.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.920
The world
could have survived

38:36.920 --> 38:38.680
without Boston Massachusetts,

38:38.680 --> 38:41.560
but now I want to help.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.520
Someone stole
my gun!

38:43.520 --> 38:44.400
Where's the safety?

38:44.400 --> 38:45.440
No!

38:45.440 --> 38:49.440
(GUNSHOT)

39:00.400 --> 39:01.840
Get any sleep?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.720
It was morning
when we returned.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.160
(DOORBELL RINGS)

39:06.160 --> 39:10.160
I'll get it.

39:17.600 --> 39:21.400
Hi.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.240
Couldn't wait to show off
the plaque, right?

39:25.240 --> 39:29.240
You'd think that after
winning two of those things...

39:30.360 --> 39:31.800
Congratulations.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.240
Nobody called
to tell you?

39:34.240 --> 39:35.680
No.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.040
What did you do
to your hand?

39:39.040 --> 39:43.040
Oh...let's get
a cup of coffee.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.640
Ellen...

39:49.640 --> 39:51.040
I won.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.960

39:52.960 --> 39:54.880
Mark, that's
wonderful!

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:55.840 --> 39:59.840
OK...OK.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.400
Good morning,
Mr Lesniak.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.840
Mrs Craig.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.600
Special delivery.
I need a signature.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.600
Lesniak,
look at this.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.080
Doctor of the Year.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.920
Heartiest
of solicitations.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.320
What happened
to your hand?

40:19.320 --> 40:20.760
Never mind that.

40:20.760 --> 40:24.760
Boy, oh, boy. I won!

40:25.040 --> 40:27.400
I thought
everyone hated me.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.880
You know,

40:28.880 --> 40:32.880
we spend most of our lives
hoping for recognition...

40:34.160 --> 40:36.080
standing on tippy-toes,

40:36.080 --> 40:39.400
trying to keep
our nose above water,

40:39.400 --> 40:41.800
thinking
no-one sees you.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.760
And so we dream...

40:43.760 --> 40:45.960
of being happier,

40:45.960 --> 40:47.600
becoming better people,

40:47.600 --> 40:49.000
of better times,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.920
and better places.

40:51.920 --> 40:55.920
And sometimes,
the dream comes true.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.560
You made this possible,

40:59.560 --> 41:03.560
Ellen, Donald, Barbara.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.080
Ahem!

41:05.080 --> 41:09.080
Not you, Lesniak.

41:09.960 --> 41:13.240
My veins are the
mass transit system.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.160
My brain is MIT.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.400
I'm 46.1
square miles,
elevation 50 feet.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.800
Jackie, we need
vitals, stat.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.200
Helen, IV.
Normal saline.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.240
I'm due
in surgery.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.160
You can take
this guy with you.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.560
Elliot, start
a central line.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.920
Everybody move.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.440
BP's 90 palp.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.400
He's out.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.640
Lot of blood in here.

41:38.640 --> 41:39.960
How's his pressure?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.120
Dropping.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.560
He needs blood.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.520
No breath sounds.
I'll intubate.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.200
Get a respirator.
Jackie, call OR.

41:47.200 --> 41:51.200
Great way to
start the day.

42:13.640 --> 42:16.560
Daniel.

42:16.560 --> 42:20.560
Daniel.

42:20.760 --> 42:24.760
Daniel!

42:27.960 --> 42:30.560
Yes, I'm still alive.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.960
Oh! Now how about
breakfast in bed?

42:33.960 --> 42:37.960
Then we'll see what
the Havenhursts are up to.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.680
Rushing to see
the list?

42:45.680 --> 42:47.880
I have to know.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.920
Maybe I'm missing
something.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.120
Wayne.

42:51.120 --> 42:55.120
Open sesame.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.000
You take care.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.080
It figures.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.680
Been running into them
all my life.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.320
Give me the stats.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.720
It got busy.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.440
BP's falling.
Rate's 130.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.520

in the chest tube?

43:16.520 --> 43:18.000
Litre and a half.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.960

list is up.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.360
What's his crit?

43:22.360 --> 43:23.760
23.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.680
He's bleeding
to death.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.120
Open his chest.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.040
What about
the OR?

43:29.040 --> 43:30.480
No time. Gloves.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.920
Takes a surgeon.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.800
Enjoy my expertise
while you can.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.240
Number 11 blade.

43:36.240 --> 43:39.040
Jackie, I'll miss
working the OR.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.040
Anyone make
third year?

43:41.040 --> 43:45.040
We made
the first two.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.840
Tore Mr Aorta.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.320
Cross-clamp it.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.160
Clamping.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.200
V-fib.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.640
Get the internal
paddles.

43:52.640 --> 43:56.640
Wasn't this guy
here yesterday?

43:59.080 --> 44:00.080
Call clear!

44:00.080 --> 44:01.240
I work fast.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.160
You guys OK?

44:02.160 --> 44:04.000
My pulse is 106.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.440
Still in v-fib.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.680
OK, again.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.120
Clear?

44:09.120 --> 44:11.200
Nothing.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.400
I'll do internal
cardiac massage.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.960
Lidocaine

amp of bicarb.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.760

Need some help?

44:17.760 --> 44:21.040
I've had
lots of practice
pumping muscles.

44:21.040 --> 44:25.040
Anyone see
Heart's new video?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.040
Good morning,
Luther.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.480
You all right?

44:34.480 --> 44:36.400
I need fresh air.

44:36.400 --> 44:37.840
What's going on?

44:37.840 --> 44:41.840
They're trying
to save Boston.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.760
I feel the heart
moving.

44:51.760 --> 44:55.760
Where's the rhythm?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.760
Sinus tach!

44:57.760 --> 44:59.080
We did it!

44:59.080 --> 45:40.000
I'm glad I didn't
study law.
