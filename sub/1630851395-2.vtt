WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:02.960
Mum, can me and Eva go to the park?

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
I thought Theresa seemed very off
this afternoon.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.720
I thought she seemed fine.
Fine?

00:08.759 --> 00:10.679
She looked miserable.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.160
I'm really worried that
something's happened.

00:13.199 --> 00:17.000
Our son is missing
and we just want him back.

00:17.039 --> 00:19.199
Probably get a fair few paedophiles
around here.

00:19.239 --> 00:21.039
It could have been one of our kids,
Eddie.

00:21.079 --> 00:24.760
I didn't find the kids in the park,
I found them by the woods.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.000
I found this on Ben's phone.

00:28.039 --> 00:31.679
We didn't see him! Why do you always
think I've done something?

00:31.719 --> 00:33.520
I haven't done anything.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.719
I didn't know Ben's dad.
Never even saw his face, actually.

00:36.759 --> 00:41.280
Ben is fine.
He's more than fine, he's normal.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.399
You've not raised a monster.
You've done a good job.

00:45.799 --> 00:48.679
Suddenly the world is dangerous.

00:50.439 --> 00:52.600
I need you to tell me
what you've done.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.479
They found his phone, Alex's phone.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.439
Tell me what happened, Ben.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.000
We found him.

01:23.599 --> 01:25.400
Found him?

01:27.799 --> 01:33.159
We tried to help him.
We tried to do CPR.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.079
Sweetheart,
but that's not true, is it?

01:35.120 --> 01:38.239
Because... you don't know
how to do CPR, Ben.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.799
I do!

01:39.840 --> 01:43.840
We do. We did in school.
Ask Auntie Helen.

01:43.879 --> 01:48.519
I am trying to help you. Please,
please just tell me, just tell me.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.120
Just tell me the truth, it's OK.
It's OK.

01:54.879 --> 01:57.560
Eva said they would think it was us.

01:57.599 --> 02:01.400
Eva said who thought what was you?
The police.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.959
Eva said if they found him,
they would know we've touched him

02:07.000 --> 02:08.680
and they would think it was us.

02:08.719 --> 02:11.919
That's why we didn't say anything.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.159
If that's true,
why did you take his phone?

02:16.199 --> 02:19.120
Why did you put his phone
in a dustbin?

02:19.159 --> 02:20.879
We didn't touch his phone.

02:20.919 --> 02:25.759
I saw you... We didn't do anything,
we just found him, I swear.

02:29.759 --> 02:31.560
Where is he?

02:33.759 --> 02:35.759
Where is Alex?

02:37.240 --> 02:39.560
The police,
they want to know where he is.

02:39.599 --> 02:41.199
They want to find out what happened,

02:41.240 --> 02:43.400
and his mummy and daddy,
they want him to...

02:45.639 --> 02:50.639
Please... just tell me where he is.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.439
He's in the water.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.840
How did you do CPR
if he was in the water?

03:13.879 --> 03:16.919
Benji, how do you do CPR
if he was in the water?

03:16.960 --> 03:19.919
Eva said they would think it was us.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.719
She said they would know who touched
him and they would think it was us.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.879
So we hid him in the water
so no-one would know.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.280
Am I going to go to prison?

04:34.319 --> 04:37.120
Hey.
Oh, my God, Jesus, you scared me.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.560
Are you all right?  Yeah,
just need to pop over to Helen's.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.720
But Eddie's gone up for the night.

04:42.759 --> 04:45.079
I thought you and I could
watch that movie or something?

04:45.120 --> 04:48.399
Yeah, no, I just need to talk about
some cafe stuff.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.439
OK.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.279
You got a minute?

05:05.319 --> 05:06.639
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.759
What's going on?  Ben said that
he and Eva found Alex in the woods.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.680
What do you mean?
What do you mean, they found him?

05:22.720 --> 05:24.519
Erm...

05:26.240 --> 05:29.120
Yesterday afternoon...

05:29.160 --> 05:30.240
when...

05:31.480 --> 05:33.399
..they were out
during the barbecue...

05:35.839 --> 05:38.560
Oh, my God. No.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.040
No, no, no, that is not true,
that can't be true.

05:42.079 --> 05:43.959
Eva... Eva would have told me.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.279
Apparently, they touched him,
tried to do CPR or something,

05:48.319 --> 05:52.000
and so Eva thought that
they would get into trouble,

05:52.040 --> 05:53.519
and so they...

05:55.959 --> 05:59.920
..they hid him and they...
that's why they didn't say anything.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.800
Ben said they hid him?
Yeah, they hid him.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.680
Put him in the water.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.360
I don't know that that's...

06:10.399 --> 06:12.399
I don't know that's what happened,
that's just...

06:12.439 --> 06:14.839
I'm just telling you, Helen,
what Ben told me.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.800
Ben is lying to you, Theresa.

06:20.839 --> 06:25.759
I'm sorry, but there is no way
that Eva would...

06:25.800 --> 06:28.120
He's clearly... Clearly,
he's trying to make it look like

06:28.160 --> 06:30.680
they both had something to do
with this.  I saw them together,

06:30.720 --> 06:33.839
I saw them together by the woods,
I saw them with Alex's phone.

06:33.879 --> 06:36.720
I mean, I saw them
put something in the bin,

06:36.759 --> 06:37.920
I don't know what it was,

06:37.959 --> 06:40.680
but then the police
found Alex's phone in landfill.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.519
Whatever happened,
it happened together,

06:42.560 --> 06:44.720
they were together,
this wasn't just Ben.

06:45.879 --> 06:47.759
What are we gonna do?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.560
We need to find out what happened,
we need to talk to them both,

06:50.600 --> 06:52.800
but separately,
so that they don't...

06:52.839 --> 06:56.240
We just, we need to be sure,
we need to be absolutely sure,

06:56.279 --> 06:58.439
so that we don't...

06:58.480 --> 07:00.680
We need to talk to them.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
DOOR CLOSES

07:11.959 --> 07:13.839
Alex!

07:15.120 --> 07:16.240
Alex!

07:17.360 --> 07:18.800
Alex!

07:21.199 --> 07:22.480
Alex!

07:28.240 --> 07:29.639
Hey.

07:31.079 --> 07:32.519
Come on, we've got to keep going.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.279
Alex!

07:38.480 --> 07:39.959
Alex!

07:45.279 --> 07:47.480
Eva, look at me.

07:49.879 --> 07:51.319
Eva.

07:52.399 --> 07:54.720
It doesn't matter what Ben said.

07:56.199 --> 07:59.360
I want you to tell me what happened.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.319
We went to the park
and we got bored,

08:04.360 --> 08:07.240
so we decided to go to the woods.

08:07.279 --> 08:10.720
I said we shouldn't,
that we're not allowed,

08:10.759 --> 08:15.120
but Ben got angry,
he went off on his own.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.720
And...

08:16.759 --> 08:19.439
I didn't want him
to get us both into trouble.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.639
I went to stop him.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.639
Eva wanted to go to the pond.
I said we shouldn't.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.600
I followed Ben into the woods.

08:30.639 --> 08:34.080
He was standing... by the pond.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.039
And we saw him.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.519
Ben was standing over him.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.480
Alex...

08:44.519 --> 08:47.080
BREATHING SHAKILY

08:47.120 --> 08:49.000
..was just lying there.

08:49.039 --> 08:50.879
I tried to help him.

08:50.919 --> 08:54.919
I tried to stop him,
but Ben pushed him into the water.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.879
Eva said we had to hide him.

08:59.919 --> 09:02.600
Did you see Ben...

09:02.639 --> 09:07.440
do anything to Alex beforehand?

09:08.519 --> 09:11.320
I... I don't know.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.759
But...
You don't have to protect him, Eva.

09:15.799 --> 09:17.919
Eva said we would get the blame.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.600
But how could you possibly get the
blame when you didn't do anything?

09:21.639 --> 09:24.440
Everyone knew Eva hated him.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.480
She hated him.

09:26.519 --> 09:28.440
She wanted him to die.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.759
That's why she said
we had to hide him.

09:31.799 --> 09:34.720
I didn't hurt him, Mum,
I didn't do anything.

09:34.759 --> 09:37.480
I swear, I swear.

09:37.519 --> 09:41.720
Eva made me keep it a secret,
she made me.

09:41.759 --> 09:44.320
He made me promise not to tell.

09:57.919 --> 09:59.200
We should call the police.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.919
Maybe... maybe you're right,
they just got confused,

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
they didn't want
to get into trouble.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.000
That's not what Eva said.

10:10.039 --> 10:12.159
Well, that's what Ben said, so...

10:16.559 --> 10:19.399
Let's not start blaming
each other's...

10:19.440 --> 10:21.159
Yeah?
I mean, they both told stories,

10:21.200 --> 10:23.039
we don't actually know
what happened.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.000
Theresa, you know I would
do anything for you,

10:25.039 --> 10:27.279
there is nothing in the world
I wouldn't do for you,

10:27.320 --> 10:29.440
but I believe my daughter.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.919
Eva showed me
the bruises on her arm...

10:33.960 --> 10:35.440
..where Ben grabbed her.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.440
This would not...

10:41.480 --> 10:44.559
I'm sorry, this would not be
the first time that Ben lied

10:44.600 --> 10:46.960
or behaved aggressively.
OK, so let's get this straight.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.639
A day ago,
you told me that he was normal,

10:48.679 --> 10:51.799
he was absolutely fine,
and that I was overreacting,

10:51.840 --> 10:54.440
and now you're saying
that Ben could be capable of...

10:55.519 --> 10:57.480
Do you know, this...
this wasn't just Ben,

10:57.519 --> 10:59.679
Eva is just telling you
what you want to hear, Helen.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.759
So you believe Ben? Do you?

11:02.799 --> 11:06.360
Then yes, we should call the police.
Yeah.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.919
I can't bear to think of it.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.240
SHE GASPS
Oh, God, that poor little boy,

11:14.279 --> 11:17.039
lying out there, all on his own.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.879
His poor parents.
I think we should check.

11:19.919 --> 11:24.240
What? Check what?
I think we should check the woods.

11:24.279 --> 11:26.480
No, Theresa.
OK, fine, well, I'll do it,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.399
I'll check.
I just think we need to be sure.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.039
I mean, they could just be
making the whole thing up. No.

11:31.080 --> 11:35.120
This is not a good idea.  I'll call
the police if I find... anything.

11:35.159 --> 11:37.279
I just have to be sure, Helen.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.840
Theresa...

11:38.879 --> 11:41.000
Please be careful!

12:02.360 --> 12:04.559
DISTANT POLICE CHATTER

12:04.600 --> 12:06.120
Thanks.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.320
Alex!

12:21.120 --> 12:22.559
Alex!

12:25.399 --> 12:26.600
Alex!

12:27.840 --> 12:29.600
Alex!

13:36.879 --> 13:38.240
Excuse me.
SHE GASPS

13:38.279 --> 13:41.639
Miss? Hello?
Hi!

13:41.679 --> 13:45.000
I'm DS Parks. Everything all right?

13:45.039 --> 13:46.519
Yeah.

13:47.919 --> 13:51.879
I got lost from the group.
Right.

13:51.919 --> 13:53.360
Can I get your name, please?

13:55.320 --> 13:58.480
Theresa Westcott.
OK, Theresa.

13:58.519 --> 14:01.559
We're winding up the search now,
so we'll walk you out, OK?

14:01.600 --> 14:03.279
Yeah, thank you.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.240
Actually, I'm gonna...
I left my car that way,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.200
so I'll just go that way,
but thank you.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.799
Are you sure everything's OK?
Yeah, thanks.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.799
OK. Watch your step.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.639
I don't want to go to school.  Yeah,
I know you don't, but you have to.

14:36.679 --> 14:37.960
Why?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.799
Because I said so.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.720
I've got a headache.
No, you don't.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.879
I do, I'm on my period.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.039
Go to school.

14:50.039 --> 14:52.200
Look, if it's not safe
for me and Gemma

14:52.240 --> 14:53.720
to go into town
with all our friends,

14:53.759 --> 14:56.200
then it's not safe
for me to go to school.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.480
Fine, then I'll drive you.

15:00.519 --> 15:01.879
Bye.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.960
Bye, Theresa.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.240
Bye, love.

15:08.279 --> 15:09.480
Morning.
Morning.

15:09.519 --> 15:13.559
Oh, sorry, Theresa, I polished that
off before my run this morning.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.840
Did you a favour, though,

15:14.879 --> 15:17.360
because I read they put
weird chemicals in that stuff.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.639
I'm gonna pop round the cafe.

15:24.679 --> 15:28.000
I thought you were having a few
days off?  Yeah, change of plan.

15:28.039 --> 15:29.440
I won't be long.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.120
Bye, Theresa.
Yep.

15:32.159 --> 15:34.399
Another 5K.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.960
KNOCK AT THE DOOR
Yeah?

15:42.120 --> 15:45.159
Mrs Bardwell, the Boyds are here
to see you. Gareth and Jean.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.159
Oh, OK, right.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.600
Jean.

15:52.639 --> 15:54.159
Gareth.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.120
You're busy. I'm so sorry,
I should have called.

16:04.159 --> 16:07.559
We can go.
Not at all. Please, come, sit down.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.639
Sorry to burst in on you. Simone,
she's our police liaison lady,

16:13.679 --> 16:16.320
she doesn't like us doing this,
but we're just...

16:16.360 --> 16:18.960
We want to get Alex's name
out in the public.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.840
We remembered last night...

16:20.879 --> 16:23.799
taking a photo of Alex...

16:23.840 --> 16:28.039
the last time I saw him,
before I went off on shift.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.360
Saturday night.

16:30.399 --> 16:31.799
I put this stupid badge on him,

16:31.840 --> 16:34.279
they give them out at work,
they're for babies and...

16:34.320 --> 16:35.799
little children.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.759
I thought it was funny.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.759
We were going through
some of his clothes

16:42.799 --> 16:45.399
to help the police with their
description of what he was wearing

16:45.440 --> 16:49.120
and we realised
he was wearing this jumper.

16:49.159 --> 16:52.720
We didn't find the badge,
so he must still have it.

16:54.759 --> 16:58.399
We've given this to the police,
but they're using the other picture,

16:58.440 --> 16:59.679
the old one.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.559
We thought maybe you could circulate
this one around the school.

17:04.599 --> 17:08.799
I know the badge is simple,
but sometimes it's...

17:08.839 --> 17:11.319
the little things that are
important.  Yeah, but it's not...

17:11.359 --> 17:14.319
It's not a birthmark, is it?
Or a scar.

17:14.359 --> 17:17.359
I mean, millions of kids
wear badges.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.880
Do you know, I'm sure that
just having a photograph

17:20.920 --> 17:23.119
with the clothes
he was actually wearing

17:23.160 --> 17:25.680
will be incredibly helpful
for the police.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.960
And of course I will circulate
that photograph,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.960
of course I'll help
in any way I can.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.279
Thank you.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.559
Thank you, Helen.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.200
We're gonna find him.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.880

Er, no, she's gone out, I'm afraid.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.079

I'll just have a flat white, thanks.
Yeah, sure. That's 3.50, please.

18:30.559 --> 18:32.559

No, it's... it's not.

18:36.119 --> 18:39.480

Yeah, so I own this place,

18:39.519 --> 18:42.000

it's fine.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.880

round the corner.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.759
I'm not "miss", I'm your boss.

18:51.319 --> 18:54.000
Right, it's just that Jen said
not to let anyone pay under...

18:54.039 --> 18:55.039
Yeah, no, I hire Jen,

18:55.079 --> 18:58.119
and so I can fire you quicker
than you can say avocado on toast,

18:58.160 --> 19:00.279
so why don't you let me tap my card?

Miss.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.400
Don't know if you recognise me,
we met in the woods last night,

19:55.440 --> 19:57.599
I'm Detective Sergeant Parks.
Yes, of course.

19:57.640 --> 20:01.160
Sorry... What were you doing
in the woods last night?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.720
I went to see Helen,
then I went for a walk

20:04.759 --> 20:07.200
and I joined the search.

20:08.279 --> 20:11.160
Well, sadly,
we found a body this morning.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.319
Almost exactly where we found you.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.319
We've yet to formally
identify the body,

20:19.359 --> 20:22.720
but we believe it, sadly,
to be Alex Boyd.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.799
He was found in the water.

20:28.319 --> 20:31.880
Can I ask what drew you to that
particular area in the woods?

20:34.920 --> 20:37.359
Nothing, I just got
separated from the group.

20:37.400 --> 20:42.440
No rumours or...
neighbourhood gossip?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.559
No?
No.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.880
OK.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.839
OK.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.680
At some point down the line,
we might ask you

20:54.720 --> 20:56.720
to come down to the station
to give a DNA sample,

20:56.759 --> 20:59.200
shoe prints, et cetera.

20:59.240 --> 21:02.079
We'll need to eliminate you
from our enquiries.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.440
Given your proximity.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.599
Yeah.

21:12.519 --> 21:14.839
We'll be in touch. Thanks.

21:17.079 --> 21:20.759
Actually, sorry, there is...
I feel stupid saying this.

21:20.799 --> 21:22.079
Erm...

21:23.519 --> 21:27.079
I... I saw a man by the woods,

21:27.119 --> 21:29.519
erm, near the children's playground,

21:29.559 --> 21:32.680
and he'd hang about,
and I didn't want to say anything

21:32.720 --> 21:36.599
because I didn't want to seem like
some awful curtain twitcher, but...

21:36.640 --> 21:41.039
You know, pointing the finger
at the first weird bloke...

21:41.079 --> 21:42.759
but nevertheless....

21:42.799 --> 21:45.160
What did he look like, this man?
Oh, I don't know,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.039
I was... too far away.

21:47.079 --> 21:49.480
You said you saw him repeatedly.

21:49.519 --> 21:52.480
Did you notice anything?
Any patterns?

21:52.519 --> 21:54.000
Any particular clothing?

21:57.279 --> 21:59.599
A long coat.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.160
And he was older.

22:02.200 --> 22:05.359
Grey-ish. Balding.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.559
When was the last time you saw him?

22:09.599 --> 22:13.240
In the woods a few days ago.

22:17.559 --> 22:21.079
I'd like to drop by later with
an E-fit specialist, if that's OK?

22:21.119 --> 22:22.160
Why?

22:23.359 --> 22:25.640
I'm not sure there's much more
I can add.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.599
Well, can't hurt to try, can it?

22:28.640 --> 22:32.079
And this gentleman
could be a person of interest.

22:32.119 --> 22:34.920
So obviously we need to pursue
every available avenue.

22:36.519 --> 22:38.680
Do you think you'll be able
to do that?  Oh, yeah.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.519
Good. Thank you.

22:43.119 --> 22:44.720
You sure there's nothing else?

22:45.960 --> 22:47.480
No.

22:48.519 --> 22:49.920
OK, thanks a lot.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.279
I'll... I'll show you out.

23:03.759 --> 23:06.559
So, you didn't think to tell me

23:06.599 --> 23:09.480
that there was a guy in the village
who was staring at kids?

23:11.160 --> 23:13.839
No. I'm sorry, I didn't.

The police were here.
'What?'

24:14.319 --> 24:16.240
I've done something really stupid.

24:16.279 --> 24:18.599
Why were the police there?

24:18.640 --> 24:21.359
Because they saw me last night,
that's where they found Alex.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.680
The detective wanted to know
what I was doing there.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.880
What did you say?

24:29.920 --> 24:32.559
I told him... Hmm!

24:34.359 --> 24:36.200
I...

24:36.240 --> 24:39.160
I-I told him that I saw a man

24:39.200 --> 24:41.119
behaving suspiciously
around the children.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.839
'What?!'

24:42.880 --> 24:45.039
I know, I just freaked out.
I was just trying to...

24:45.079 --> 24:47.200
I just... I wanted to protect Ben.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.720
What did the detective say?

24:53.359 --> 24:55.799
Er, they're sending over somebody...

25:00.319 --> 25:03.319
..an E-fit specialist.

25:03.359 --> 25:07.079
You just tell them you don't really
remember what he looked like.

25:07.119 --> 25:08.720
They're gonna know I'm lying, Helen.

25:08.759 --> 25:10.960
'Then you tell them very little.'

25:11.000 --> 25:13.160
You don't really remember,
you can't be sure.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.559
That way, you've given them nothing
and you won't get into trouble.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.319
So, you're saying that
we shouldn't tell the truth?

25:24.160 --> 25:27.240
Just do what you think is best, OK?

25:27.279 --> 25:30.119
'I've got to go. I love you.'

25:45.519 --> 25:47.039
Come through.

25:50.079 --> 25:52.599
I'm sorry, I can't see him
like that. I can't!

25:52.640 --> 25:54.880
It's OK.
It's OK, I'll come with you.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.000
No, go with Gareth. I'm not...
Please, I'll just...

25:58.039 --> 25:59.559
I'll wait.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.319
Yeah.

27:10.839 --> 27:12.599
Take your time, Theresa,

27:12.640 --> 27:15.720
Domonique here can work with
whatever it is you remember.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.079
He had a wider nose.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.279
It's difficult, isn't it,
because I don't know

27:31.319 --> 27:33.119
I couldn't even describe
Fraser's nose

27:33.160 --> 27:35.559
if it wasn't right in front of me.

27:35.599 --> 27:39.039
OK. Why don't we just look at
what you do know?

27:39.079 --> 27:41.680
You said grey hair.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.200
Yes, grey hair, messy.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.000
Right. So not "balding", then?

27:58.079 --> 28:01.279
Balding on top,
and then the hair was at the side.

28:01.319 --> 28:02.720
Like a ring.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.160
He's quite heavy set,
like, quite drooping-shoulders,

28:07.200 --> 28:09.519
not much of a neck to speak of.

28:09.559 --> 28:11.400
And he had a paunch.

28:15.279 --> 28:16.640
Tiny eyes.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.160
Yes, that's it.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.480
And he was wearing a long coat,
browny beige.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.240
Oh, sweetheart.

29:17.279 --> 29:19.039
Sorry.

29:19.079 --> 29:21.039
I thought I was being discreet.

29:21.079 --> 29:24.559
I think we're all allowed a bit of
an office cry at the minute.

29:26.519 --> 29:28.160
I heard you went to see him.

29:29.960 --> 29:34.160
Yes. Jean asked me to, so...

29:36.400 --> 29:38.160
My God.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.599
Oh, my God, Helen, you're amazing.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.079
I couldn't...

29:47.640 --> 29:49.759
Go home, hmm?

29:49.799 --> 29:52.240
Get some sleep. Hmm?

29:55.359 --> 29:57.839
I'm so sorry...

29:57.880 --> 30:00.240
I should have told you.

30:00.279 --> 30:02.119
Told me what?

30:04.160 --> 30:07.039
This is Alex's tablet.

30:09.119 --> 30:11.759
There are some things on it.

30:11.799 --> 30:13.960
Nasty things.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
They're from Eva and Ben.
What do you mean?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.839
I wanted you to see it

30:23.880 --> 30:26.799
before we give the tablet back
to Alex's parents.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.359
Thank you for letting me know.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.000
I will, erm...

30:36.319 --> 30:38.960
I will talk to the children.

30:40.200 --> 30:43.000
And to Alex's parents.

30:43.039 --> 30:46.680
OK.  You've done the right thing,
thank you.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.519
Now, listen, if you feel like
you need to take tomorrow off,

30:50.559 --> 30:53.759
then you just take tomorrow off,
all right?

35:36.880 --> 35:39.760
Only old people say "the internet",
Dad.

35:41.360 --> 35:45.840
It's not just Grace's mum, anyway.
Lots of people recognise him.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.800
They say they've seen him about
and that he's really weird.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.119
Well, Helen'll probably know.
Has she said anything?

35:51.159 --> 35:54.480
No. And, er, the police are just
talking to him as a witness.

35:54.519 --> 35:57.480
Yeah, but imagine if you actually
caught the murderer, though.

35:57.519 --> 35:59.920
They'd probably make a podcast
about you.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.320
CHAIR SCRAPES THE FLOOR

36:05.320 --> 36:07.480
Shall I tell him...
No.

36:07.519 --> 36:10.159
We just had a disagreement
about school. He's best left.

36:26.239 --> 36:27.880
Can I get you anything else?

36:27.920 --> 36:29.840
MUTED CHATTER

36:35.519 --> 36:36.880
Cheers.

36:39.079 --> 36:40.679
Hi.
Jen's out the back, I...

36:40.719 --> 36:42.880
No, it's cool,
I don't... don't need Jen.

36:42.920 --> 36:47.239
Erm, actually, I just... I wanted
to apologise for being so rude.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.199
I've had a lot going on at home
and...

36:51.239 --> 36:52.360
That's not an excuse.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
What's your name?
Er, it's Jeremy.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.039
Sorry, Jeremy.
That's OK.

36:57.079 --> 36:59.599
I'd love that flat white now,
if you...? Yeah.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.800
I saw you, er,
looking at the papers.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.000
Sorry?

37:06.039 --> 37:09.199
The, er...
Yes. Horrid.

37:09.239 --> 37:11.960
Everyone seems to think
it's that photographer.

37:13.199 --> 37:14.840
What photographer?

37:14.880 --> 37:18.119
Well, I, erm... I don't want to...

37:18.159 --> 37:20.840
You know, the guy from the paper,
Colin Chiswick. Bit weird.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.199
Yeah. Everyone seems to think
that's he's done it.

37:23.239 --> 37:24.960
I wouldn't be too surprised,
to be honest.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.920
Normal blokes don't go around taking
pictures of kids at sports day,

37:27.960 --> 37:29.159
but don't ask me.

37:29.199 --> 37:31.360
I don't want to spread
any fake news, you know.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.440
Ah. Sorry, the, er,
the register's broken today,

37:34.480 --> 37:36.599
it's, er, it's card only.

37:39.079 --> 37:41.440
I-I was just joking.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.800
Cool.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.760

PHONE VIBRATES

37:55.679 --> 37:56.679
Hello?

37:56.719 --> 37:58.920
'Miss Westcott? It's, er, DS Parks.'

37:58.960 --> 38:02.400
Yes, right?
'Hi.'

38:02.440 --> 38:04.800
Yeah, I'd like you to make time
to come down to the station

38:04.840 --> 38:05.880
as soon as you can, please.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.159
We'd like you to look at
some photographs,

38:08.199 --> 38:11.159
see if you can identify
the man you saw in the woods.

38:11.199 --> 38:13.719
So you've found him, then?

38:13.760 --> 38:16.679
'Just whenever you can come down,
we'd really appreciate it.'

38:16.719 --> 38:18.360
OK.
'Yeah.'

38:18.400 --> 38:21.800
Oh, Jesus Christ.

PHONE RINGING

38:26.719 --> 38:29.599
'Hello, this is Helen Bardwell.
Sorry I can't take your call.

38:29.639 --> 38:32.199
'If you leave a message after
the beep, I'll call you back.'

38:46.400 --> 38:47.840
You can't just barge in here!

38:47.880 --> 38:49.719
You didn't answer the telephone,
Helen!

38:49.760 --> 38:51.920
You nearly caused
a full security incident!

38:51.960 --> 38:54.639
The police want to see me,
they want me to look at photographs,

38:54.679 --> 38:57.239
they want me to point someone out,
someone that I have never seen.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.519
Excuse me!

38:58.559 --> 39:03.320
It's this... erm, guy called,
erm, something Chiswick,

39:03.360 --> 39:04.960
some photographer from the Herald!

39:05.000 --> 39:07.239
I know who he is, Theresa,
Colin Chiswick,

39:07.280 --> 39:09.440
he takes the bloody
sports day photographs!

39:09.480 --> 39:12.000
I didn't picture him!
I didn't picture him!

39:12.039 --> 39:14.679
I've never seen him,
I wasn't describing him.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.440
I was just... It was...

39:16.480 --> 39:19.119
Th-They're going to expect me
to identify him.

39:19.159 --> 39:21.159
How do you know it's him they have?

39:21.199 --> 39:23.800
Well, they're going to expect me
to identify someone.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.559
What do you expect me to say?

39:27.599 --> 39:29.800
You shouldn't even be in here
discussing this.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.360
Everybody just saw you
fly in here in a panic!

39:32.400 --> 39:35.079
You don't think!
Everything you do is chaos!

39:36.440 --> 39:40.800
I can't keep saving you every time
you make another stupid mistake!

39:42.480 --> 39:43.480
What are you saying?

39:43.519 --> 39:45.360
I can't get caught up in this
any more.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.280
Why are you saying this?

39:48.440 --> 39:51.880
It's like I am the problem...

39:51.920 --> 39:55.280
when your daughter is involved
as well.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.079
I'm just trying to help.

39:57.119 --> 39:59.599
At least I haven't got my head
buried in the sand.

39:59.639 --> 40:02.440
You made this your problem
when you decided to go to the woods

40:02.480 --> 40:06.519
to "check", when you decided
to make somebody up to the police!

40:12.679 --> 40:15.079
I'll tell them I don't remember.

40:15.119 --> 40:17.559
I'll tell them
I don't recognise any of them.

40:17.599 --> 40:19.960
No-one has mentioned Eva or Ben.
Because they'll...

40:20.000 --> 40:23.559
They'll just think
that I'm... I'm mad or stupid,

40:23.599 --> 40:25.760
that's what people think
half the time anyway.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.880
We'll be fine.

40:26.920 --> 40:31.519
It's not. It's really not fine.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.840
This is Alex's tablet.
He has it for learning difficulties.

40:44.559 --> 40:46.760
His teacher found these.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.639
Miss Westcott.
Hi.

41:01.679 --> 41:02.920
Hi.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.920
They're messages from Ben to Alex.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.920
The last is as recently
as a few days ago.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.199
I can show you others.

41:11.239 --> 41:12.639
No.

41:16.519 --> 41:19.440
I'm worried that, eventually,
the police will ask to see it.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.639
That will lead them to Ben...

41:24.599 --> 41:26.440
..that will lead them to you.

41:31.159 --> 41:35.119
Maybe if the police
had something else,

41:35.159 --> 41:38.679
if they were onto someone else,
then those might seem less relevant.

41:38.719 --> 41:41.239
So if you wouldn't mind
scrolling down.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.400
Just see if you recognise
any of these gentlemen.

41:51.599 --> 41:53.840
HELEN: They wouldn't be
holding Chiswick

41:53.880 --> 41:56.039
if they didn't have something
on him.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.599
It might not be the worst thing.

42:04.559 --> 42:07.639
Do you know what happens to children
in Ben's position?

42:11.199 --> 42:14.000
Is this what you would do
if it was Eva?

42:14.039 --> 42:16.679
What would you do?
What would you do?

42:18.519 --> 42:21.320
BREATHES SHAKILY

42:34.920 --> 42:37.360
I think it's him.

42:38.559 --> 42:39.800
Are you sure?

42:53.119 --> 42:55.000
Yes.

43:19.599 --> 43:21.840
Thanks, Miss Westcott.
Yes.

43:21.880 --> 43:27.159
Sorry. Sorry. Can I ask you,
the man I, erm... That man...

43:28.960 --> 43:31.239
..do you think he did it?

43:31.280 --> 43:35.679
Just out of interest, did you...
did you recognise him at all?

43:35.719 --> 43:38.119
Why?

43:38.159 --> 43:41.440
He's a bit of a figure round here,
you know?

43:41.480 --> 43:44.480
His name came up several times
after we published the E-fit.

43:44.519 --> 43:46.400
Mm-hm.
He has a bit of a history.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.119
Right. How?

43:49.159 --> 43:52.199
Well, he destroyed
several hard drives.

43:52.239 --> 43:55.480
He has some...
questionable collections.

43:55.519 --> 43:58.400
And also now
we have your identification

43:58.440 --> 44:01.079
and no good alibi
for the night of the murder.

44:01.119 --> 44:03.039
Night?

44:06.239 --> 44:08.920
Sorry, I...
CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY

44:09.960 --> 44:15.440
Er... I-I heard that
Alex died in the daytime, Sunday.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.000
He was killed Saturday night,

44:18.039 --> 44:21.599
the night before
he was reported missing.

44:21.639 --> 44:24.760
Pathology thinks he was lying
in the woods for almost two days.

44:26.239 --> 44:29.119
He was killed in the night.
Thanks, Miss Westcott.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.960
Hiya.
'How was it?'

44:39.000 --> 44:42.079
Alex was killed at night. He wasn't
killed during the barbecue,

44:42.119 --> 44:43.400
he was killed the night before.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.760
So it couldn't have been them,
because they were in bed.

44:45.800 --> 44:47.559
It wasn't them.

44:47.599 --> 44:49.239
'We were wrong.'

44:53.119 --> 44:55.320
A man's gonna get arrested, Helen.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.400
We were wrong.
