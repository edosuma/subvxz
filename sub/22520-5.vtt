01:13.941 --> 01:15.475

01:18.679 --> 01:21.081

01:48.909 --> 01:51.545
Sutton help.

01:55.782 --> 01:59.186
Don't let them
take me Sutton.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.889
Help me Sutton,

02:01.989 --> 02:04.591
Sutton.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.961
Don't let them
take me Sutton.

02:08.061 --> 02:11.064
Help me.

02:11.198 --> 02:14.134
Help me Sutton.

02:14.234 --> 02:17.938
Sutton help.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.775
Please help,

02:21.875 --> 02:23.443

02:33.320 --> 02:35.189
Help me!

02:39.459 --> 02:41.929
Help me Sutton!

02:42.029 --> 02:44.364
Sutton,

02:44.464 --> 02:48.168
Sutton, Sutton
help,

02:48.268 --> 02:50.037
help me!

03:18.265 --> 03:19.933
Sutton,

03:20.033 --> 03:21.869
Sutton!

03:57.371 --> 04:00.807
Mustn't take it
so badly Holmes.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.510
What?

04:03.610 --> 04:06.113
Well I know it's inconvenient
but you really mustn't

04:06.246 --> 04:08.348
let it affect you
like this.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.684
Whatever do you
mean?

04:10.784 --> 04:14.121
You are sitting there
boiling with indignation

04:14.221 --> 04:16.456
because you have been
forced to leave

04:16.557 --> 04:19.392
the warmth and comfort
of 221B by the order

04:19.493 --> 04:22.095
of Mrs. Hudson's
spring cleaning.

04:22.196 --> 04:26.834
My dear Watson however
did you deduce that?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.970
By simply applying
your methods Holmes.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.638
Indeed?

04:31.772 --> 04:34.141
You'll agree
that you are not here

04:34.241 --> 04:36.210
for either a shave
or a haircut.

04:36.343 --> 04:37.477
That is true.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.946
How did
you know?

04:39.046 --> 04:41.048
Because you invariably shave
yourself and you are patently

04:41.181 --> 04:43.183
not due for a haircut
for another two weeks.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.285
Correct.

04:45.419 --> 04:48.422
And you left our rooms
in some haste.

04:48.555 --> 04:54.061
You are without either
your gloves or your cane.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.163
Go on.

04:56.263 --> 05:00.400
Well, I know that Mrs. Hudson's
been trying to complete

05:00.501 --> 05:03.170
her spring cleaning
all day.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.906
Now, you have been
sitting there

05:06.006 --> 05:09.443
frowning,
eyes tightly closed,

05:09.576 --> 05:11.478
grinding your
teeth,

05:11.578 --> 05:13.146
and all the time
your fingers

05:13.280 --> 05:14.915
have been drumming
like pistons

05:15.015 --> 05:16.950
on the arm
of that chair.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.254
So given all this at once
even I cannot fail to deduce

05:20.354 --> 05:23.757
that you are have quarreled
with our good housekeeper

05:23.857 --> 05:27.127
and sought refuge in the sanity
of the barbershop.

05:27.227 --> 05:32.132
You cannot deny
that I am right.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.869
Oh, Watson
you could not be

05:35.969 --> 05:38.572
further from
the truth.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.642
I am here to get
our good barber's advice

05:41.775 --> 05:44.678
as to the specimen of hair
found at the scene

05:44.778 --> 05:47.681
of a bloody misadventure
last Tuesday in Debford.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.149
Oh,
come along Holmes.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.351
You're worried
about something.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.620
What you perceived
as agitation

05:53.720 --> 05:57.925
was indeed most intense
tranquil enjoyment.

05:58.025 --> 06:01.762
My eyes were closed
because I was trying to recall

06:01.862 --> 06:04.731
as vividly as I could
the concert

06:04.832 --> 06:07.634
that we attended
last night.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.103
You were
grinding your teeth.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.539
That is because
I made a slight error

06:12.639 --> 06:15.576
in my recollection
of Urkian's fingering

06:15.676 --> 06:18.345
his cadenza
in the third movement

06:18.445 --> 06:20.147
of the Beethoven
Violin Concerto

06:20.247 --> 06:21.715
ba, ba, ba.

06:29.489 --> 06:32.493
Nevertheless there is
an element of truth

06:32.626 --> 06:34.294
in what you say.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.696
Ah.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.383
A doctor's,

06:56.483 --> 06:59.253
a general practitioner's
I perceive,

06:59.353 --> 07:02.523
not been long in practice
or had much to do,

07:02.623 --> 07:04.925
come to consult us
I fancy.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.660
Lucky
we came back.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.053
Ah,
Mr. Holmes.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.821
Thank you
Mrs. Hudson.

07:34.922 --> 07:39.560
Doctor, this is my friend
and colleague Dr. Watson.

07:39.660 --> 07:43.363
Pray resume your seat
and tell me how I may serve you.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.934
Well, I am indeed a doctor
and my name is Percy Travelian

07:47.067 --> 07:49.736
and I live at
number 403 Brook Street.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.805
Aren't you
the author

07:51.905 --> 07:55.108
of a monograph upon
obscure nervous lesions?

07:55.209 --> 07:57.211
Yes, but I so seldom
hear of the work

07:57.344 --> 07:59.313
I thought
it quite dead.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.114
By no means.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.050
My publishers
have given me

08:03.150 --> 08:05.619
a most discouraging account
of its sales.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.855
You are yourself
a medical man?

08:07.955 --> 08:09.790
Retired
army surgeon.

08:09.890 --> 08:13.260
My hobby has always been
the study of nervous disease.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.095
I should of course
like to make it

08:15.195 --> 08:17.331
an absolute specialty
but a man

08:17.431 --> 08:19.500
must take
what he can get first.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.503
However, this is
beside the question

08:22.603 --> 08:24.438
and I do appreciate,
Mr. Holmes,

08:24.538 --> 08:26.773
how very valuable
your time is.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.643
The fact is that
a singular train of events

08:29.743 --> 08:32.246
has occurred recently
at my house in Brook Street

08:32.379 --> 08:34.381
and tonight they came
to such a head

08:34.515 --> 08:37.116
that I felt it was impossible
to wait another hour

08:37.217 --> 08:40.587
before asking for your advice
and your assistance.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.056
You are very welcome
to both.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.997
Let me have a detailed
account of the circumstances

08:50.097 --> 08:51.798
which have
disturbed you.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.234
Well one or two of them
are so trivial

08:54.334 --> 08:56.803
that I am almost
ashamed to mention them.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.939
But the matter
is so inexplicable

08:59.072 --> 09:01.175
and the recent turn
it has taken so elaborate

09:01.275 --> 09:03.443
that I shall lay it all before you
and you shall judge

09:03.544 --> 09:06.013
what is essential
and what is not.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.616
I am a London University man
and I am not unduly

09:09.750 --> 09:14.054
singing my praises when I say
I was a very promising student.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.456
And it was thought
a distinguished career

09:16.557 --> 09:18.091
lay before me.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.195
However, there was
one great stumbling block.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.596
Money?

09:22.696 --> 09:24.932
Indeed doctor,
money.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.801
I needed capital
not only to practice

09:27.901 --> 09:29.870
but also to get out of
the scrawled rooms

09:29.970 --> 09:31.939
I was forced
to rent.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.441
I could not expect
my patients to trust me

09:34.541 --> 09:36.777
if I could not afford
the proper equipment.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.713
Yes, I've seen it happen
to too many of us.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.282
I myself was obliged
to go into the army

09:42.416 --> 09:43.917
in order to follow
my career.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.118
Indeed.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.921
I had thought of
abandoning my own career

09:48.021 --> 09:50.757
except for one sudden
and unexpected incident.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.260
Exactly what kind
of incident?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.095
One morning
two years ago

09:55.195 --> 09:57.064
I received a visit
from a man by the name

09:57.164 --> 10:00.334
of Blessington who until that time
had been a complete stranger to me.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.589
Come in.

10:29.396 --> 10:33.333
Good heavens,
do you live here, in this?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.903
Yes,
I'm afraid I do.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.971
You are the same
Percy Travelian

10:38.105 --> 10:40.474
who's had so
distinguished a career,

10:40.574 --> 10:43.410
recently won the Slater
award for medicine?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.546
I am.

10:45.679 --> 10:49.883
Then answer me
frankly sir,

10:49.983 --> 10:52.753
and you'll find it
in your interest to do so.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.322
Despite your present
financial situation,

10:55.422 --> 10:57.658
you clearly have
all the cleverness

10:57.758 --> 10:59.626
that makes
a successful man.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.395
But have you
the tact?

11:01.495 --> 11:04.531
I trust that I have
my share, sir.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.633
Any
bad habits?

11:06.733 --> 11:08.468
Not drawn
toward drink?

11:08.569 --> 11:10.470
Now
really sir.

11:10.571 --> 11:12.306
Quite right,
quite right.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.680
But I was bound
to ask.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.081
Why?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.316
Why sir?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.785
Simply why
with all these qualities

11:24.885 --> 11:27.554
are you not
in practice?

11:27.654 --> 11:29.623
Come now it's that old story
more in the brains

11:29.756 --> 11:31.725
than in
the pocket hey?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.827
Now sir
what would say sir

11:33.961 --> 11:36.497
if I were to start
you in Brook Street?

11:36.630 --> 11:39.299
If a specialist
is to succeed he must aim high

11:39.399 --> 11:42.603
and a practice in Brook Street
is just the beginning.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.005
Capital,
keep yourself in style,

11:45.105 --> 11:48.075
the hire of respectable carriage and horse,

11:48.175 --> 11:51.612
surgery that's worthy of you,
waiting room, servants

11:51.745 --> 11:55.549
and the best equipment
that money can buy.

11:55.649 --> 11:58.652
That is what you
will have sir.

12:07.694 --> 12:10.197
But why?

12:10.330 --> 12:13.300
It's just like
any other investment,

12:13.400 --> 12:15.569
safer than most.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.138
And what am I
to do?

12:18.272 --> 12:19.907
I'll tell you.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.476
I will take the house,
furnish it,

12:22.609 --> 12:25.012
pay the maids
and run the whole place.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.748
All you have to do
is to wear out the chair

12:27.848 --> 12:29.683
in your
consulting room.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.819
Then you
hand over to me

12:31.952 --> 12:34.588
three quarters
of everything you earn

12:34.688 --> 12:37.391
and keep one quarter
for yourself.

12:37.491 --> 12:41.128
Now what do you say
to that sir?

12:41.228 --> 12:44.498
Do you agree?

12:46.967 --> 12:49.469
This then Mr. Holmes
was the strange proposal

12:49.603 --> 12:51.905
with which Mr. Blessington
approached me.

12:55.576 --> 12:57.611
I will not weary you
with how we

12:57.744 --> 12:59.613
bargained
and negotiated.

12:59.713 --> 13:02.983
But it ended with my moving
into the house next quarter

13:03.083 --> 13:06.019
and starting in practice
on very much the same conditions

13:06.119 --> 13:07.988
as he had
suggested.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.041
Waiting room
for your patients.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.772
Your consulting
room.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.913
I can't believe it
Mr. Blessington,

14:06.013 --> 14:09.516
nor can I
thank you enough.

14:09.650 --> 14:12.920
He turned the two best rooms
on the first floor

14:13.020 --> 14:15.689
into a sitting room
and a bedroom for himself

14:15.789 --> 14:18.559
and came to live with me
in the character of

14:18.659 --> 14:21.028
a resident
patient.

14:21.128 --> 14:24.131
His heart was weak
but not abnormal.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.734
And yet he demanded
constant medical supervision.

14:27.868 --> 14:33.307
He was a man of singular
habits, shunning company

14:33.440 --> 14:39.146
and very seldom going out
except in one respect.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.782
Every evening at the same time
he would go for a walk

14:41.915 --> 14:45.886
for half an hour exactly
no matter what the weather.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.256
And every evening
at the same hour

14:49.356 --> 14:52.092
he would walk into
the consulting room.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.161
He would then
examine the books,

14:54.261 --> 14:57.397
put down five crumpets
for every guinea I had earned

14:57.498 --> 14:59.600
and then carried the rest
off to the strong box

14:59.733 --> 15:01.268
in his
own room.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.442
I may say with confidence
Mr. Holmes

15:08.542 --> 15:11.678
that he never had occasion
to regret his speculation.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.281
From the first
it was a success

15:14.414 --> 15:17.784
and during the last two years
I have made him a rich man.

15:17.885 --> 15:19.086
So much Mr. Holmes,

15:19.186 --> 15:20.988
for my past history
and my relations

15:21.088 --> 15:23.924
with the resident patient
Mr. Blessington.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.759
It only remains
for me now to tell you

15:25.859 --> 15:28.529
what has occurred
to bring me here tonight.

15:28.629 --> 15:31.965
Some weeks ago
Mr. Blessington came down to me

15:32.065 --> 15:33.967
in as it
seemed to me

15:34.067 --> 15:36.036
a considerable
state of agitation.

15:37.171 --> 15:38.605
Dr. Travelian,

15:38.705 --> 15:40.774
Dr. Travelian,
Dr. Travelian,

15:40.908 --> 15:42.376
Dr. Travelian,
Dr. Travelian,

15:42.509 --> 15:44.711
Dr. Travelian,
Dr. Travelian sir.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.847
Mr. Blessington
calm yourself sir.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.316
Calm myself?
Calm myself?

15:49.416 --> 15:52.586
But my dear sir
have you not heard of the burglary?

15:52.686 --> 15:54.154
Burglary?

15:54.288 --> 15:55.756
Where?

15:55.889 --> 15:58.458
No, no, no
not here sir,

15:58.592 --> 16:01.562
not here, but it could
have been.

16:01.695 --> 16:05.165
Could have been...

16:09.803 --> 16:12.072
Within a week
the whole house had become

16:12.172 --> 16:14.541
a fortress of bolts
and bars and locks.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.844
Are you sure
these bars are strong enough?

16:16.944 --> 16:19.880
They'd be strong enough
for the bank of England, sir.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.482
Mr. Blessington?

16:21.615 --> 16:23.917
When I questioned
him upon the point

16:24.017 --> 16:25.919
he became so offensive
that I was compelled

16:26.019 --> 16:27.754
to drop
the subject.

16:27.855 --> 16:30.624
At first Mr. Holmes
I thought he merely sought

16:30.724 --> 16:32.726
to protect
his strong box,

16:32.860 --> 16:35.863
but then I suspected
that it was his life

16:35.996 --> 16:37.698
he was
protecting.

16:37.798 --> 16:41.235
From then on he stopped
going out all together,

16:41.335 --> 16:43.403
peered continually
out of his windows

16:43.537 --> 16:46.673
and kept himself locked
in his room in what

16:46.773 --> 16:50.711
I could only describe
as a state of mortal dread.

17:20.741 --> 17:23.777
Dr. Travelian,
before you continue,

17:23.911 --> 17:26.980
you say you found this man Blessington

17:27.114 --> 17:29.917
prostrate on his bed
clutching a newspaper?

17:30.017 --> 17:33.453
More precisely
the remains of a newspaper

17:33.554 --> 17:36.123
for he had torn it
to shreds.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.626
Torn to shreds.

17:39.726 --> 17:46.066
Do you recall the contents
of this newspaper at all?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.635
No, I'm afraid not even if
I'd known what I was looking for.

17:48.769 --> 17:49.736
When was this?

17:49.870 --> 17:51.104
It was some
weeks ago,

17:51.205 --> 17:52.906
the beginning
of May I think.

17:53.006 --> 17:56.310
Gradually as time passed
his fears appeared to die away

17:56.410 --> 17:59.379
and he renewed
his former habits.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.415
Good evening
Dr. Travelian.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.983
Wonderful evening
outside.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.853
I'm beginning to enjoy
my walks again.

18:05.953 --> 18:09.723
And then suddenly
a fresh event reduced him

18:09.823 --> 18:11.725
to the pitiable state
of prostration

18:11.825 --> 18:14.094
in which
he now lies.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.064
What happened was
yesterday I received this letter

18:17.164 --> 18:20.400
from a Russian nobleman
now resident in England

18:20.501 --> 18:22.503
who suffers
from catalepsy.

18:22.636 --> 18:24.838
In it he announces
his intention of visiting me

18:24.938 --> 18:26.773
for a consultation
this very evening

18:26.874 --> 18:28.876
at a quarter
past six.

18:34.014 --> 18:36.817
Because of the chief difficulty
in the study of catalepsy

18:36.917 --> 18:39.153
and the rareness
of the disease

18:39.253 --> 18:41.755
you may believe
that at the appointed hour

18:41.889 --> 18:43.924
I was eager
to receive the patient.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.893
Good evening
gentlemen.

18:45.993 --> 18:48.362
I'm Dr. Travelian
and it was you sir

18:48.462 --> 18:50.497
I assume
who wrote to me?

18:50.631 --> 18:54.134
My father speaks
very little English doctor,

18:54.268 --> 18:57.738
so I trust you will
excuse my coming in with him

18:57.871 --> 18:59.940
as his health
is a matter

19:00.073 --> 19:02.910
of the most overwhelming
importance to me.

19:03.010 --> 19:04.111
Yes,
I respect that sir.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.212
Fenton,

19:05.345 --> 19:09.483
perhaps you would like to
join us for the consultation?

19:09.583 --> 19:11.985
Nyet, nyet,
not for all of the world.

19:12.085 --> 19:15.389
It is more painful to me
than I can express.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.324
If I were to see my father
in one of those

19:17.424 --> 19:19.626
dreadful seizures
I am convinced

19:19.726 --> 19:21.895
I would never
survive it.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.531
My own
nervous system

19:24.665 --> 19:27.201
is an exceptionally
sensitive one.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.736
With your permission
I will remain

19:29.837 --> 19:32.539
in your waiting room while
you go into my father's case.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.308
Yes,
of course.

19:34.408 --> 19:36.109
thank you
doctor.

19:49.590 --> 19:51.558
Thank you
Fenton.

19:51.658 --> 19:56.063
Now sir, I hope
you will forgive me

19:56.163 --> 19:59.500
if I ask you a few
basic questions.

19:59.600 --> 20:04.171
First,
can you tell me your age?

20:04.304 --> 20:07.508
Sixty-seven.

20:07.608 --> 20:10.577
And apart from
catalepsy

20:10.711 --> 20:14.081
would you say you are
physically sound?

20:14.181 --> 20:17.584
Normally do you
have good health?

20:17.684 --> 20:20.854
Um,
no headaches?

20:20.954 --> 20:23.657
Abdominal pain?

20:23.757 --> 20:26.560
Any pain at all?

20:26.660 --> 20:28.362
No.

20:28.462 --> 20:30.397
Good.

20:30.497 --> 20:34.034
Naturally I will
examine you thoroughly

20:34.168 --> 20:37.237
but this is merely
a preliminary.

20:37.371 --> 20:39.840
Do you
smoke cigars?

20:39.940 --> 20:41.842
Yes.

20:41.942 --> 20:44.478
Do you
drink alcohol?

20:44.611 --> 20:46.313
Vodka.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.215
Vodka?

20:48.315 --> 20:50.784
I see.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.954
Every day?

21:04.198 --> 21:05.399
I didn't expect ...

21:10.504 --> 21:13.607
my first feeling
was one of pity and horror.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.943
My second I fear
was rather

21:16.043 --> 21:18.512
one of professional satisfaction.

21:18.612 --> 21:21.682
There was nothing markedly
abnormal in his condition

21:21.815 --> 21:25.118
which had harmonized
with my former experiences.

21:25.219 --> 21:28.422
I had obtained
good results in such cases.

21:28.522 --> 21:31.291
By the inhalation
of nitrite of alma

21:31.391 --> 21:34.428
and the present seemed
an admirable opportunity

21:34.561 --> 21:36.797
of testing
its virtues.

21:36.897 --> 21:40.334
Now sir, I believe
you can hear me.

21:40.434 --> 21:43.036
I should be back
directly rest assured.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.829
Fenton,

22:41.929 --> 22:45.232
Fenton,
Fenton immediately.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.842
Fenton, the two gentlemen
you showed in

22:54.975 --> 22:56.310
less than
15 minutes ago,

22:56.410 --> 22:57.945
did you
see them leave?

22:58.078 --> 22:59.746
Leave, no sir.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.281
Are you sure?

23:01.381 --> 23:03.317
I'm positive sir.

23:12.926 --> 23:14.795
Good evening
Dr. Travelian.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.997
Good evening
Mr. Blessington

23:17.130 --> 23:18.832
and how was
your walk today?

23:18.932 --> 23:21.835
A little rain
but very amiable my good sir.

23:21.935 --> 23:23.670
Very amiable.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.607
Did you
hear them leave?

23:26.707 --> 23:28.142
No, sir.

23:28.242 --> 23:30.244
I was nowhere near
the hall.

23:30.377 --> 23:31.912
Well you should
have been.

23:32.045 --> 23:33.280
That is
your duty.

23:33.380 --> 23:35.649
Now I know you are new here
but you should know by now.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.851
Doctor!
doctor!

23:37.985 --> 23:40.220
doctor!
doctor!

23:40.320 --> 23:42.656
Someone has
been in my room.

23:42.756 --> 23:44.791
No one has been
in your room sir.

23:44.925 --> 23:45.959
A lie.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.361
You're lying
to me.

23:47.461 --> 23:49.530
I assure you
I am not.

23:49.663 --> 23:53.100
Fenton, have you been
in Mr. Blessington's room?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.169
Of course
I haven't.

23:55.269 --> 23:56.904
There you are
you see.

23:57.004 --> 23:58.539
Then come up
and see for yourself.

24:07.014 --> 24:08.115
Now sir.

24:08.248 --> 24:10.584
Look at those.

24:10.684 --> 24:15.088
Are you telling me
that they're mine?

24:15.189 --> 24:18.692
Well at first glance
they do appear

24:18.826 --> 24:20.894
to be too
large for you.

24:21.028 --> 24:23.497
Of course
they're not mine.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.633
I always remove
my galoshes at the front door.

24:26.767 --> 24:28.602
Has anything
been stolen?

24:28.702 --> 24:31.071
No, but that's
not the point.

24:31.171 --> 24:32.973
Nothing
has been stolen?

24:33.073 --> 24:35.275
My privacy has been
invaded by a stranger,

24:35.375 --> 24:36.376
is that
not enough?

24:53.427 --> 24:56.463
Mr. Blessington?

24:56.597 --> 24:59.066
Mr. Blessington?

24:59.166 --> 25:03.370
Leave me alone,
go away and leave me alone.

25:03.470 --> 25:06.440
Surely there's something
I can do to help.

25:06.540 --> 25:08.408
Shall I
call the police?

25:08.509 --> 25:12.045
No... Not those buglers.

25:12.179 --> 25:18.318
There's only
one person who can help me now.

25:18.418 --> 25:21.488
And that is why
I am here.

25:21.622 --> 25:25.058
But I must apologize
for such a trivial reason.

25:25.192 --> 25:28.495
A thief
that doesn't steal.

25:28.595 --> 25:31.064
Did he ask
for me by name?

25:31.198 --> 25:33.033
Oh, yes.

25:33.133 --> 25:37.404
Then let us
be on our way.

25:43.510 --> 25:45.078
Thank you.

25:45.212 --> 25:46.980
This way?

25:53.754 --> 25:55.055
Stay where
you are.

25:55.155 --> 25:57.224
I have a pistol
and I give you my word

25:57.357 --> 25:59.560
I will shoot
if you come any nearer.

25:59.660 --> 26:02.462
Mr. Blessington
this is outrageous sir!

26:02.563 --> 26:05.466
Do you not
recognize me?

26:05.566 --> 26:08.569
Is that you
doctor?

26:08.702 --> 26:11.038
Yes, of course
it is me.

26:11.138 --> 26:12.940
The other
two gentlemen,

26:13.040 --> 26:15.275
are they what they
pretend to be?

26:15.375 --> 26:16.844
They are
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

26:16.977 --> 26:18.879
and his friend
Dr. Watson.

26:18.979 --> 26:20.514
Good God
Mr. Blessington,

26:20.647 --> 26:23.350
it was you that asked me
to fetch them.

26:23.450 --> 26:27.721
Yes, yes, yes,
forgive me,

26:27.821 --> 26:29.790
forgive me.

26:38.398 --> 26:40.901
Gentlemen
do come up.

26:45.172 --> 26:48.509
I'm sorry if my precautions
have annoyed you.

26:48.609 --> 26:50.310
Good evening
Mr. Holmes.

26:50.410 --> 26:52.179
I'm sure I'm very
much obliged

26:52.279 --> 26:53.881
to you for
coming around.

26:54.014 --> 26:57.518
No one has ever needed
your advice more than l, no one.

26:57.651 --> 26:59.887
I expect Dr. Travelian
has told you

26:59.987 --> 27:02.689
of this unwarrantable intrusion
into my rooms.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.991
My sir,
Mr. Blessington,

27:04.091 --> 27:05.859
who are
these two men?

27:05.959 --> 27:08.395
Which two men,
I don't know them.

27:08.495 --> 27:10.731
Then why do they
wish to molest you?

27:10.831 --> 27:12.166
Molest me?

27:12.266 --> 27:15.302
You could hardly expect me
to answer that.

27:15.435 --> 27:17.671
You mean that
you don't know?

27:17.771 --> 27:20.174
Come in here,
please.

27:20.274 --> 27:24.278
Just have the kindness
to step in here!

27:38.725 --> 27:41.261
I've never been a rich man,
Mr. Holmes.

27:41.395 --> 27:43.730
I've never made but one
investment in my life,

27:43.831 --> 27:46.066
Dr. Travelian
will tell you that

27:46.166 --> 27:49.069
but I don't believe
in bankers sir.

27:49.169 --> 27:52.139
Never trust a banker
Mr. Holmes, never.

27:52.272 --> 27:54.575
It's between
ourselves.

27:54.675 --> 27:57.911
What little I have
is here in this strong box.

27:58.011 --> 28:00.380
So you can understand
what it means to me

28:00.481 --> 28:03.517
when unknown people force
themselves into my rooms.

28:03.650 --> 28:09.323
Mr. Blessington
I cannot possibly advise you

28:09.423 --> 28:13.160
if you try
to deceive me.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.928
Deceive you?

28:15.028 --> 28:17.831
But I've
told you everything.

28:17.931 --> 28:19.933
Good night
Dr. Travelian.

28:20.067 --> 28:23.537
Mr. Holmes,
no advice for me?

28:23.670 --> 28:26.740
My advice to you
is to speak the truth.

28:34.248 --> 28:35.782
Holmes?

28:47.528 --> 28:48.996
Cab!

28:52.566 --> 28:54.001
Holmes.

28:54.101 --> 28:55.569
I can read
in a man's eyes

28:55.702 --> 28:58.238
when it's his own skin
that he's frightened of.

28:58.372 --> 29:00.174
Yes, But why
did you call him a liar?

29:00.274 --> 29:03.310
Because I am certain that
he does know who these men are.

29:03.443 --> 29:04.578
Cab!

29:08.415 --> 29:11.285
A young Russian penetrated
to Blessington's rooms

29:11.385 --> 29:14.354
while his confederate kept
the doctor from interfering.

29:14.488 --> 29:17.558
And of course catalepsy is a
very easy complaint to imitate.

29:17.691 --> 29:19.393
Yes, I know
I've done it myself.

29:19.493 --> 29:21.728
Holmes?

29:21.829 --> 29:23.997
Might there be
one alternative,

29:24.097 --> 29:27.501
grotesquely improbably no doubt
but still just conceivable,

29:27.601 --> 29:30.204
might the whole story
of the cataleptic Russian

29:30.337 --> 29:32.439
and son be a concoction
of Dr. Travelian

29:32.573 --> 29:35.242
who for his own purposes
has been in Blessington's room?

29:35.342 --> 29:38.011
But did you see the footprints
on the stair carpet?

29:38.111 --> 29:40.547
They were square toed,
quite unlike Blessington's

29:40.647 --> 29:43.050
which are round and an
inch and a third longer

29:43.150 --> 29:45.118
than Dr. Travelians.

29:45.252 --> 29:47.955
I think we can
sleep on this Watson

29:48.055 --> 29:49.890
but I should be surprised
if we do not hear

29:49.990 --> 29:51.758
from Brook Street
in the morning.

29:51.859 --> 29:53.393
Good night.

29:53.527 --> 29:55.229
Night old fellow.

30:06.039 --> 30:07.774
Morning doctor.

30:07.875 --> 30:09.510
Your tea is here.

30:09.610 --> 30:11.078
Thank you
Nora.

30:36.203 --> 30:39.406
Mr. Blessington,
your breakfast tea.

30:43.343 --> 30:45.212
Mr. Blessington?

31:18.045 --> 31:20.681
Watson...

31:20.781 --> 31:22.316
get dressed quickly.

31:22.449 --> 31:24.351
There's a cab
waiting for us.

31:24.451 --> 31:25.319
Why?

31:25.419 --> 31:26.787
What's the matter?

31:26.887 --> 31:28.689
The Brook Street
business.

31:28.789 --> 31:31.391
Any fresh news?

31:31.525 --> 31:37.798
For God's sake,
come at once, P. Travelian.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.669
Oh, Mr. Holmes
I'm so glad you could come.

31:42.769 --> 31:44.238
What has happened?

31:44.371 --> 31:46.373
Mr. Blessington
has committed suicide.

31:46.507 --> 31:47.474
Suicide?

31:47.608 --> 31:48.442
Yes.

31:48.542 --> 31:49.877
He hung himself
during the night.

31:58.318 --> 31:59.920
Has the body
been touched?

32:00.053 --> 32:01.522
No.

32:01.655 --> 32:04.124
Where's the page?

32:04.224 --> 32:06.160
Nowhere to be found.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.248
Good morning
inspector.

32:28.382 --> 32:30.818
Mr. Holmes,
delighted to see you.

32:30.918 --> 32:32.419
Now please
take a look.

32:32.553 --> 32:34.588
We were just about
to take him down.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.042
Right, inspector.

32:55.175 --> 32:56.643
Stretcher.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.571
That'll be all.

33:24.671 --> 33:28.208
Have heard of the events
leading up to this affair?

33:28.342 --> 33:31.145
Yes, Dr. Travelian
has told me something of them.

33:31.245 --> 33:32.012
And have you formed
an opinion?

33:32.112 --> 33:33.614
Now as far as I can see,
the man was driven

33:33.747 --> 33:36.016
out of his senses
by fright.

33:36.116 --> 33:38.118
The bed has been
well slept in.

33:38.252 --> 33:41.255
There was his impression
deep enough for all to see.

33:41.388 --> 33:43.690
It is about
5:00 in the morning.

33:43.791 --> 33:45.759
You know that suicides
are most common.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.529
That would be about the time
that he hanged himself.

33:48.662 --> 33:51.131
It seems to be a very
deliberate affair.

33:51.231 --> 33:53.167
Yes, from the rigidity
of the limbs

33:53.267 --> 33:55.235
I'd say he'd been dead
about three hours.

33:55.369 --> 33:56.470
Thank you
Watson.

33:56.603 --> 33:58.872
Notice anything
peculiar about the room.

33:58.972 --> 34:01.675
There was a screwdriver
on the mantel piece

34:01.775 --> 34:04.511
and he seems to have
smoked heavily during the night.

34:04.611 --> 34:06.480
I found these
in the fireplace.

34:12.018 --> 34:13.821
Have you his
cigar holder?

34:13.920 --> 34:16.389
No,
I haven't seen one.

34:16.523 --> 34:19.326
His cigar
case then?

34:19.426 --> 34:21.661
Yes, it was in
his coat pocket.

34:30.437 --> 34:32.473
This is savannah,

34:32.606 --> 34:36.476
And these others are
the cigars of a peculiar sort

34:36.577 --> 34:38.277
which is imported
by the Dutch

34:38.378 --> 34:40.112
from the East Indian
colonies.

34:40.214 --> 34:43.217
They're usually wrapped in straw
you know and are thinner

34:43.350 --> 34:45.652
for their length
than any other brand.

34:45.752 --> 34:47.554
I don't suppose you've
read monograph

34:47.654 --> 34:49.422
on cigars
and cigar action?

34:49.523 --> 34:50.657
Well l, um ...

34:50.791 --> 34:53.393
No, of course not.
Thank you.

34:55.896 --> 34:59.600
These have been smoked
with a holder and these without.

34:59.700 --> 35:04.404
These have been cut
by a not very sharp knife

35:04.505 --> 35:07.241
and these have had their ends
bitten off

35:07.341 --> 35:12.045
by a set of
very excellent teeth.

35:12.146 --> 35:18.652
There were three men here
last night.

35:18.786 --> 35:23.624
Good heavens
but nothing was stolen

35:23.724 --> 35:25.793
so what were
they doing here?

35:25.926 --> 35:28.529
That is what
we have to find out.

35:28.662 --> 35:30.364
How did they
get in?

35:30.464 --> 35:33.100
The same way we did
through the front door.

35:33.233 --> 35:35.502
But the door
was barred in the morning.

35:35.602 --> 35:37.437
Then it was barred
after they left.

35:37.538 --> 35:39.173
Well how do you
know that?

35:39.306 --> 35:41.275
I saw
their traces.

35:41.408 --> 35:43.410
If you would just give me
a few moments Inspector,

35:43.544 --> 35:46.380
I may be able to give you
some further information.

35:54.521 --> 35:55.556
Don't move
Watson.

38:27.474 --> 38:30.310
The actual facts
are very simple.

38:30.410 --> 38:32.513
And I shall be surprised
if by the afternoon

38:32.646 --> 38:35.015
I cannot give you the reasons
for them as well.

38:35.115 --> 38:37.785
But Holmes, can't
you tell us anything now?

38:37.885 --> 38:43.590
Oh, there is no doubt
as to the sequence of events.

38:43.690 --> 38:46.226
The three of them
in it.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.162
A young man,
an old man

38:48.262 --> 38:52.332
and a third to whose identity
I have no clue.

38:52.466 --> 38:56.670
The first two I need
hardly remark

38:56.770 --> 39:00.574
are the same who masqueraded as
the Russian Count and his son.

39:00.674 --> 39:03.010
So we can give a very good
description of them,

39:03.110 --> 39:04.878
can we not
Dr. Travelian?

39:04.978 --> 39:06.947
They were admitted
by a confederate

39:07.080 --> 39:07.548
inside the house.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.589
They entered
the hall.

39:15.722 --> 39:19.126
The older man first,
the younger man second

39:19.226 --> 39:23.063
and the unknown man
in the rear.

39:23.163 --> 39:27.468
They ascended
the stairs.

39:34.875 --> 39:39.012
With the help of a wire
they forced the key.

39:39.146 --> 39:41.582
Even without the lens
you can see where

39:41.682 --> 39:43.817
the pressure
has been applied.

39:43.951 --> 39:47.888
On entering the room
the first proceeding

39:48.021 --> 39:52.059
must have been to gag
Mr. Blessington.

39:59.466 --> 40:02.302
Having secured Blessington
it is evident to me

40:02.402 --> 40:05.906
that a consultation of
some sort was held

40:06.039 --> 40:09.576
probably in the nature
of a judicial proceeding.

40:09.710 --> 40:11.612
It must have lasted
for some time

40:11.712 --> 40:14.014
for it was then
that the cigars were smoked.

40:14.114 --> 40:15.749
It was there that
the older man sat

40:15.883 --> 40:18.185
in the wicker chair.

40:18.285 --> 40:20.754
It was he who used
the cigar holder.

40:20.888 --> 40:23.190
The younger man
sat there.

40:23.290 --> 40:26.193
He knocked his ash off
against the chest of drawers.

40:26.293 --> 40:29.663
The unknown fellow
paced up and down.

40:29.763 --> 40:32.833
Blessington I think
sat upright in the bed,

40:32.966 --> 40:36.003
but of that I cannot
be absolutely certain.

40:36.136 --> 40:40.340
It ended of course
by them taking Blessington...

41:46.240 --> 41:48.542
Now this matter
was so prearranged

41:48.642 --> 41:51.445
that it is my belief
that they brought with them

41:51.545 --> 41:54.848
some sort of block
or pulley to serve as a gallows.

41:54.948 --> 41:57.785
Oh, yes
as gallows Inspector.

41:57.885 --> 42:01.121
This was
a revenge ritual.

42:01.221 --> 42:04.725
Well an extraordinary
story.

42:04.858 --> 42:07.227
But what proof?

42:07.327 --> 42:11.231
I'll have it
before the day is out.

42:11.331 --> 42:13.033
You haven't
explained about

42:13.133 --> 42:14.802
the screws
and the screwdriver.

42:14.935 --> 42:17.304
Oh, that was to fix up
the block or pulley.

42:17.404 --> 42:19.006
But when they saw
the chandelier hook

42:19.139 --> 42:21.508
they naturally
saved themselves the trouble.

42:21.608 --> 42:24.344
No Inspector I suggest that you
immediately make inquiries

42:24.445 --> 42:26.313
about the page
and arrest him.

42:26.413 --> 42:27.848
Certainly
Mr. Holmes.

42:27.948 --> 42:30.217
I will be back here
a little before 3:00.

42:30.317 --> 42:32.119
Good day.

42:53.740 --> 42:57.044
I daresay Mrs. Hudson
will be a little put out

42:57.144 --> 42:59.046
when she sees
all this.

42:59.146 --> 43:02.049
What are you
looking for?

43:02.149 --> 43:04.017
Worthington, W,

43:04.118 --> 43:08.055
Worthingon, March
1880 I'm sure.

43:08.188 --> 43:09.723
March '80,

43:14.528 --> 43:15.863
'80,

43:19.366 --> 43:20.901
January,

43:21.034 --> 43:23.403
February,

43:23.504 --> 43:26.373
March.

43:26.473 --> 43:29.209
Any good?

43:29.309 --> 43:32.980
Watson...

43:33.113 --> 43:38.652
Blessington or Sutton
as he was known then.

43:42.089 --> 43:43.490
Mrs. Hudson.

43:43.590 --> 43:47.594
Your little boat is coming along
beautifully Doctor.

43:47.728 --> 43:50.030
Oh, thank you
Mrs. Hudson.

43:50.130 --> 43:51.732
I must run.

44:10.250 --> 44:11.552
Ah, thank you.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.521
Dr. Travelian.

44:14.655 --> 44:15.355
Any news Inspector?

44:15.456 --> 44:16.857
Yes, sir we've got
the page

44:16.957 --> 44:18.992
drinking his earnings
two streets away.

44:19.126 --> 44:20.260
But I got
the man.

44:20.394 --> 44:21.628
You've
got them?

44:21.728 --> 44:23.764
Or at least
I've got their identity.

44:23.897 --> 44:25.566
The Worthington
Bank Gang?

44:25.699 --> 44:26.934
Precisely.

44:27.034 --> 44:29.136
Well then Blessington
must have been Sutton.

44:29.269 --> 44:30.304
Exactly.

44:30.437 --> 44:32.406
Well that makes it
clear as crystal.

44:32.506 --> 44:33.974
not to me
I'm afraid.

44:34.074 --> 44:35.342
Dr. Watson
would you, uh ...

44:35.442 --> 44:36.810
You may have
heard of the great

44:36.910 --> 44:39.079
Worthington bank affair?

44:39.213 --> 44:40.914
There were
five men in it.

44:41.014 --> 44:42.983
The three who were
in this room,

44:43.117 --> 44:46.386
a fourth named Cartwright
and Blessington.

44:51.391 --> 44:53.360
Alright,
let's be gone.

45:16.250 --> 45:18.418
It's a hanging
job now.

45:18.552 --> 45:23.056
Only if
someone squeals.

45:30.264 --> 45:31.532
That's him.

45:31.632 --> 45:34.034
Are you positive?

45:34.134 --> 45:38.439
Oh, yes,
that's him.

45:38.539 --> 45:45.779
Sutton, Sutton,
you're dead, dead, dead.

45:45.879 --> 45:49.016
Sutton,
you're dead.

45:49.149 --> 45:51.952
Sutton...

45:52.052 --> 45:55.689
Don't worry Mr. Sutton,
it's a hanging job now.

45:58.859 --> 46:00.360
Sutton, you hear.

46:00.494 --> 46:02.563
Sutton
or Blessington

46:02.696 --> 46:05.666
who was the worst
of the gang turned informer.

46:05.799 --> 46:08.669
On his evidence
Cartright was hanged

46:08.769 --> 46:12.973
and the other three
got 15 years apiece.

46:13.073 --> 46:15.676
Bibel, Haywood
and Moffit

46:15.809 --> 46:18.312
were released from prison
just a few weeks ago

46:18.445 --> 46:20.981
which was several years
before their full term.

46:21.115 --> 46:23.750
It was news of their release
which caused Blessington

46:23.884 --> 46:25.819
to panic and have
this house secured.

46:25.919 --> 46:28.355
So it was not the fear
burglary that had frightened him?

46:28.455 --> 46:30.958
No, no,
that was a mere blind.

46:31.091 --> 46:32.759
And so setting me up
in practice

46:32.893 --> 46:35.729
was an elaborate charade
to protect himself.

46:41.001 --> 46:43.003
Well why could
he not tell you this?

46:43.137 --> 46:45.139
He was trying
to hide his own identity

46:45.272 --> 46:47.574
from everybody
for as long as he could.

46:47.674 --> 46:49.209
His secret
was shameful

46:49.343 --> 46:51.879
and he couldn't bring
himself to divulge it.

46:52.012 --> 46:54.081
However,
wretch as he was

46:54.214 --> 46:57.217
he was still living under
the shield of British law.

46:57.351 --> 46:58.986
And I have no doubt
Inspector

46:59.119 --> 47:02.623
that we shall see that though
that shield may fail to guard,

47:02.756 --> 47:06.760
the sword of justice
is still there to avenge.

47:06.894 --> 47:09.630
In spite of the efforts
of Sherlock Holmes

47:09.730 --> 47:11.965
the three murderers
of Blessington

47:12.065 --> 47:14.201
eluded the police
and fled the country

47:14.334 --> 47:16.270
aboard a ship
bound for Portugal.

47:16.370 --> 47:18.839
It was a few weeks later
that we learned

47:18.972 --> 47:20.941
that the ship,
the Nora Crainer

47:21.041 --> 47:24.044
had sunk with all hands upon
the Portuguese Coast

47:24.178 --> 47:26.613
some leagues to the north
of a porter.

47:56.443 --> 47:58.212
Holmes.

47:58.312 --> 48:01.148
What's wrong?

48:01.248 --> 48:04.618
Well it's just that I was going
to spend the day writing

48:04.718 --> 48:07.521
the case
of Dr. Travelian

48:07.621 --> 48:10.090
while the facts
are still fresh.

48:10.224 --> 48:12.826
Oh, you mean...
oh, I understand.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.829
Thanks awfully.

48:15.929 --> 48:22.336
It's just that it is difficult
to concentrate otherwise.

48:28.108 --> 48:32.146
What will you entitle
this particular account?

48:32.279 --> 48:36.917
I didn't know you were
interested in my writing.

48:37.050 --> 48:41.488
I am always interested
in your choice of titles.

48:41.622 --> 48:44.658
Well I thought
I would call it

48:44.792 --> 48:46.527
the Brook Street
Mystery.

48:51.565 --> 48:52.900
No?

48:53.000 --> 48:55.068
Well I myself
would prefer

48:55.202 --> 48:57.805
The Resident Patient,
but please

48:57.938 --> 48:59.706
do not let me
influence you.

49:04.211 --> 49:09.082
The Brook Street Mystery
no doubt would suffice.
