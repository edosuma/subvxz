WEBVTT

01:30.550 --> 01:32.177
What's up, Lizard?

01:33.344 --> 01:35.555
We're going out tonight.

02:18.097 --> 02:20.141
At La Dispensaria.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.811
I got a table ready.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.439
Show up around midnight.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.827
La Dispensaria?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.329
All right.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.333
Guess who that was?

03:28.459 --> 03:29.669
Your partner.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.547
He just gave me a great gift.

03:33.715 --> 03:34.924
Poison.

03:39.971 --> 03:42.015
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

03:42.223 --> 03:44.267
Yeah, sure.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.477
He's not a fool.

03:47.562 --> 03:48.771
Gotta go.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.859
Gonna stick me with the bill?

03:56.779 --> 03:59.198
Cheap son of a bitch.

04:26.184 --> 04:28.978
- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.

04:29.938 --> 04:31.898
Let's go inside and have a good time.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.382
It's on, boys!

04:57.465 --> 05:00.718
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

05:00.802 --> 05:03.846
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.140
Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.

05:06.224 --> 05:08.726
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

05:08.810 --> 05:11.604
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

08:14.954 --> 08:18.624
How many fucking times do I have
to tell you not to waste the acid?

08:23.546 --> 08:27.216
To be productive, you can't waste money!
Come on!

08:28.384 --> 08:32.805
Hands up!
Everybody on your knees!

08:34.515 --> 08:36.434
What the fuck is going on here?

08:36.517 --> 08:37.852
Get down!

08:51.032 --> 08:52.658
Attention!

08:53.910 --> 08:55.369
Position!

08:56.454 --> 08:58.122
Take aim!

08:58.998 --> 08:59.874
Load weapons!

09:01.751 --> 09:02.919
Fire!

09:56.055 --> 09:59.433
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

09:59.517 --> 10:02.395
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.273
But you're not a communist.

10:05.356 --> 10:07.942
No, not a communist, something worse.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.444
A trafficker.

10:10.528 --> 10:13.698
- A trafficker?
- Yes, a drug trafficker.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.044
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

12:05.226 --> 12:07.311
Hey, partner.
What are you doing here?

13:00.281 --> 13:01.574
Pablo Escobar?

13:01.657 --> 13:03.075
Where's Felipo?

13:03.325 --> 13:05.202
Felipo's been arrested.

13:05.286 --> 13:07.079
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

13:07.163 --> 13:10.166
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

13:10.249 --> 13:12.668
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.879
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.547
Show some respect.

13:18.716 --> 13:20.968
Now what's the problem, Mr. Jose Luis?

13:23.429 --> 13:25.055
How do you know my name?

13:25.306 --> 13:27.308
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.021
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

13:35.065 --> 13:39.069
There's Garcia, Lopez...

13:39.153 --> 13:41.197
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes, Pinilla.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.239
That's Pinilla.

13:42.323 --> 13:43.991
Pinilla...

13:44.074 --> 13:45.910
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.078
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

13:48.162 --> 13:49.705
I don't have all day.

13:54.210 --> 13:55.294
Open them up.

14:04.929 --> 14:06.555
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.183
Who the fuck do you think you are?

14:09.266 --> 14:12.853
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

14:12.937 --> 14:14.730
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.524
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.400
Where are your import papers?

14:19.401 --> 14:21.737
You need papers for these TV sets.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.239
Take them.

14:24.949 --> 14:30.037
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellin police making a shit salary.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.456
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

14:32.540 --> 14:34.333
It's for Carlitos.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.377
Your son.

14:38.546 --> 14:41.257
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

14:43.425 --> 14:44.760
Hey, Pinilla!

14:46.971 --> 14:50.140
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

14:50.224 --> 14:56.146
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

14:57.273 --> 15:01.443
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

15:01.527 --> 15:04.947
Right? She's a fox.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.657
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.785
What's she doing with a guy like you?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.627
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

15:20.838 --> 15:23.841
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

15:27.928 --> 15:30.431
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

15:30.514 --> 15:33.684
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.520
Good. That makes us happy.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.481
Gentlemen...

15:40.566 --> 15:42.735
I'm going to tell you who I am.

15:43.944 --> 15:47.114
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.451
My eyes are everywhere.

15:50.701 --> 15:54.038
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

15:54.121 --> 15:55.706
without me knowing about it.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.876
Do you understand? Not a finger.

16:01.253 --> 16:05.716
One day, I'm going to be
president of the Republic of Colombia.

16:06.717 --> 16:10.846
So look, I make deals for a living.

16:10.929 --> 16:14.475
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

16:15.392 --> 16:17.811
or accept the consequences.

16:21.482 --> 16:22.816
Silver...

16:24.652 --> 16:26.028
or lead.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.073
You decide.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.663
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right, then.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.958
We're going to let them through.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.961
The trucks. Let them through.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.379
This is Pablo.

17:25.462 --> 17:26.380
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.840
- What's up?
- Mateo Moreno.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.426
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

17:30.509 --> 17:32.428
All right, yesterday we were talking,

17:32.511 --> 17:36.974
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.434
Explain.

17:38.517 --> 17:41.562
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.689
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

17:43.772 --> 17:46.275
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.777
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.197
Now tell him how much it costs.

17:52.448 --> 17:56.285
In Chile, this little thing
costs 10 bucks a gram.

17:56.535 --> 18:00.122
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

18:00.205 --> 18:05.419
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.004
Also...

18:07.921 --> 18:10.424
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.051
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

18:14.428 --> 18:16.805
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

18:16.889 --> 18:18.766
we can find room on our trucks.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.310
We can sell it in Bogota', Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

18:21.560 --> 18:23.771
We're going to be rich.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.607
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.068
Well look, Cuca...

18:31.028 --> 18:33.071
you don't have any vision, my friend.

18:35.866 --> 18:38.076
If it costs $10 a gram here...

18:39.119 --> 18:42.331
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

18:46.502 --> 18:47.920
I love that song.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.299
One more.

23:32.788 --> 23:35.332
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.169
Would you like a little coffee?

23:40.837 --> 23:41.838
Yes, a coffee.

23:44.424 --> 23:48.845
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

23:48.929 --> 23:53.809
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.562
Little magic leaves.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.399
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

24:01.483 --> 24:07.447
Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

24:07.531 --> 24:12.619
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

24:12.702 --> 24:16.706
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.625
Let it dry, dry, dry.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.752
You use ammonia to get the paste.

24:21.795 --> 24:26.091
And here it is. It's pasty... but pure.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.426
Here is the prize.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.012
It's like the kitchen in your house.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.057
Like baking a cake.

24:35.851 --> 24:39.020
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.066
Look, an old press, an antique.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.907
Now we put it in the oven.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.618
Here's one. The other will follow.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.788
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.040
Well...

25:00.125 --> 25:03.587
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.256
- No.
- You said a kilo.

25:06.965 --> 25:08.592
We'll take five.

25:08.675 --> 25:12.387
How do we get five across the border?

25:12.470 --> 25:14.347
That's Gustavo's department.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.980
This one has got a good engine.

25:22.063 --> 25:24.774
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

25:24.858 --> 25:27.068
would be under the rear wheel well.

25:27.152 --> 25:29.279
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.697
Is this easy to take off?

25:30.780 --> 25:33.491
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.952
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

25:36.036 --> 25:38.997
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.667
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

25:42.751 --> 25:44.920
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

25:45.003 --> 25:50.050
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.552
For three cars, that's 60 kilos.

25:52.636 --> 25:55.889
So it's $9 profit per gram.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.515
$9,000 per kilo.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.602
$9,000 times 60...
the profit is $540,000.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.356
Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?

26:04.439 --> 26:06.149
OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.887
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

26:37.514 --> 26:39.474
All this smells like shit to me.

26:39.557 --> 26:43.103
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

26:43.186 --> 26:45.522
The stinkier, the better.

26:46.189 --> 26:47.440
All right.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.277
What about all these lights?

26:51.861 --> 26:54.364
Is that to tip off the cops, or what?

26:54.447 --> 26:58.785
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.788
I'm the artist here, clear?

27:01.871 --> 27:03.164
Clear.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.969
You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

27:22.392 --> 27:25.520
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

27:33.194 --> 27:35.196
Let's build them a chimney.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.998
Gentlemen, the first three?

27:45.081 --> 27:48.668
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

27:48.752 --> 27:50.795
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

27:50.879 --> 27:54.007
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

27:55.050 --> 27:57.719
How much can a first class ticket cost?

27:57.802 --> 27:59.888
I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

28:07.687 --> 28:10.523
Hey, Mom, how much
do you think we can fit in there?

28:11.232 --> 28:14.652
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

28:14.736 --> 28:16.154
Trust me, Pablito.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.198
I love it. Let's do it.

28:21.618 --> 28:24.204
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.541
It's Gustavo.

28:29.417 --> 28:30.752
Five kilos, right?

28:40.220 --> 28:42.055
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

28:42.138 --> 28:44.015
Hey Pablo, this is Lion.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.895
It's not like we're rich, right?

28:48.978 --> 28:50.980
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

28:51.064 --> 28:52.607
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

28:52.690 --> 28:53.942
Here's three.

28:54.025 --> 28:56.653
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

28:56.736 --> 28:58.530
- That's right.
- Pablito...

28:58.613 --> 29:01.032
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

29:01.116 --> 29:04.369
Look, my love... it won't fit me.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.204
Try it on.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.497
Come here.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.374
That's it.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.875
Good, right?

29:13.420 --> 29:14.462
One...

29:15.713 --> 29:17.841
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

29:17.924 --> 29:18.967
...three.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.221
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

29:23.304 --> 29:24.973
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

29:25.056 --> 29:27.934
Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

29:28.017 --> 29:32.105
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

29:32.188 --> 29:35.358
- Listen to this guy.
- He looks very handsome, son.

29:35.442 --> 29:37.777
Like a fag model, isn't that right?

30:10.768 --> 30:12.687
- What's up, my man?
- What's up, son?

30:12.770 --> 30:14.939
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

30:15.023 --> 30:16.608
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

30:16.691 --> 30:17.901
It's so hot.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.069
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

30:20.153 --> 30:21.529
You like my jacket, brother?

30:21.613 --> 30:24.741
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.370
I was in jail for a while, remember?

30:30.371 --> 30:33.500
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

30:33.583 --> 30:36.377
What you got there
is the perfect product.

30:36.461 --> 30:39.255
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

30:40.048 --> 30:41.841
It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

30:41.925 --> 30:42.967
Yes, sir.

30:46.679 --> 30:47.847
Here you go.

30:49.307 --> 30:51.434
Go on. There are five kilos.

30:52.227 --> 30:53.269
Where are you going?

30:53.520 --> 30:55.939
<i>I'm gonna gen another 'gasket, brother.</i>

30:56.022 --> 30:58.358
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

31:42.652 --> 31:45.196
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

31:45.280 --> 31:47.865
You guys are pilots,

31:47.949 --> 31:51.327
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

31:52.870 --> 31:57.250
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.295
We'll take four.

32:00.378 --> 32:01.838
All right, much better.

32:01.921 --> 32:06.634
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

32:06.718 --> 32:09.178
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

32:12.724 --> 32:14.100
Come in, please.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.983
Look, here are the packets.

32:22.066 --> 32:25.653
You take a packet,
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.030
Easy, right?

32:27.113 --> 32:29.657
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

32:29.741 --> 32:30.825
All right?

32:30.908 --> 32:32.994
But with you two,
we have a problem.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.996
You girls are pregnant, right?

32:35.079 --> 32:39.709
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

32:39.792 --> 32:44.631
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

32:44.714 --> 32:47.842
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

32:47.925 --> 32:50.386
All right? All right. Perfect.

33:32.220 --> 33:34.347
COLOMBIAN COFFEE

33:45.692 --> 33:47.652
Do you trust this guy?

33:47.735 --> 33:50.321
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

33:50.405 --> 33:53.491
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.201
But he's got good routes.

33:59.831 --> 34:00.915
Hello, Carlos.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.375
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

34:02.458 --> 34:03.710
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

34:03.793 --> 34:05.628
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.715
How was your flight?

34:08.798 --> 34:10.299
Smooth.

34:10.383 --> 34:11.634
Let's get down to business.

34:11.718 --> 34:15.596
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.933
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

34:19.726 --> 34:21.561
- How far?
- Miami.

34:25.606 --> 34:28.192
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

34:28.276 --> 34:30.027
Counting the gasoline.

34:38.828 --> 34:39.954
Carlos...

34:40.997 --> 34:42.039
Yes?

34:46.085 --> 34:49.380
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

34:49.464 --> 34:51.632
and only leave space for the pilot?

34:53.342 --> 34:55.094
We'll leave the engine, right?

34:56.220 --> 34:57.805
How much?

34:57.889 --> 35:00.391
About... 300 more.

35:01.142 --> 35:05.438
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

35:39.597 --> 35:41.891
We brought you a little present.

35:43.643 --> 35:45.269
Brazilians.

35:46.896 --> 35:50.149
Best asses in the world, believe me.

35:50.233 --> 35:52.735
No, I'm not feeling well.

35:57.281 --> 35:59.784
What the fuck is up with you guys?

35:59.867 --> 36:02.537
You're flying around in planes...

36:02.620 --> 36:04.914
while I'm rotting here in this jungle?

36:04.997 --> 36:07.667
Look, let us explain what we have to--

36:07.750 --> 36:09.418
Wait.

36:09.502 --> 36:12.797
From now on, in all of my labs...

36:12.880 --> 36:17.426
I'll build a large house with a pool

36:17.510 --> 36:19.971
- and air-conditioning-
- And whores from Brazil.

36:20.054 --> 36:22.473
- Just for you.
- One problem.

36:22.557 --> 36:25.226
These are my labs.

36:32.358 --> 36:36.571
Relax. No one's arguing with you.

36:36.654 --> 36:39.073
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

36:49.542 --> 36:53.254
How something like this
can make so much money!

36:53.337 --> 36:57.508
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

36:57.592 --> 36:59.552
What do you think, Pablo?

36:59.635 --> 37:02.013
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.764
I wouldn't get involved.

37:03.848 --> 37:07.101
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.437
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.605
Of course.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.857
Same old contraband routes.

37:13.983 --> 37:16.903
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

37:17.153 --> 37:20.698
the Peruvians will raise the price.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.702
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

37:24.785 --> 37:28.205
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

37:28.289 --> 37:33.044
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

37:33.294 --> 37:37.506
You need a lot of creativity for that.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.761
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

37:41.844 --> 37:45.640
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

37:45.723 --> 37:49.268
I will take it to you in Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

37:49.352 --> 37:51.938
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

37:52.021 --> 37:55.107
I'll charge 35 percent
of the sales value,

37:55.191 --> 37:59.695
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

37:59.779 --> 38:01.614
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--

38:01.864 --> 38:03.115
Deal?

38:06.702 --> 38:07.870
Deal.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.164
Sounds good to me.

38:11.624 --> 38:15.628
All right, I will create my own routes

38:15.711 --> 38:19.256
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

38:19.340 --> 38:21.217
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.678
Partners?

38:27.765 --> 38:30.559
We know your policy toward partners.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.813
Let's just call us...

38:34.063 --> 38:35.648
"friendly associates."

38:37.483 --> 38:38.943
To Miami.

42:45.856 --> 42:49.276
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

42:49.360 --> 42:53.072
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

42:53.155 --> 42:55.324
Tell me something, Cockroach.

42:55.407 --> 42:58.577
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

42:58.661 --> 43:01.622
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

43:01.705 --> 43:06.669
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

43:06.752 --> 43:08.545
Let me give you a piece of advice.

43:10.130 --> 43:12.007
Never say this to Pablo.

43:12.883 --> 43:15.094
He's not as forgiving as I am.

43:33.696 --> 43:35.072
Stop!

43:46.375 --> 43:48.460
What do you have in the spare tires?

43:51.255 --> 43:54.633
390 kilos, Pablo. We lost it.

43:55.718 --> 43:58.971
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?

43:59.054 --> 44:00.931
Just what I said, we lost it.

44:02.016 --> 44:04.059
It just disappeared?

44:04.143 --> 44:07.062
Into thin air?

44:07.146 --> 44:10.274
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

44:10.357 --> 44:13.652
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

44:14.945 --> 44:16.071
Look“.

44:17.072 --> 44:22.369
We've paid every cop
from hereto Ipsalia.

44:24.204 --> 44:26.373
So how did we lose a load, brother?

44:26.457 --> 44:31.045
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

44:37.092 --> 44:38.761
And how much is he asking?

44:39.970 --> 44:41.347
Too much.

44:47.394 --> 44:48.896
What are you going to do?

44:50.230 --> 44:51.607
Come back, Pablo.

44:53.108 --> 44:56.028
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

44:56.111 --> 44:57.780
Where are you going, Pablo?

44:58.489 --> 44:59.740
Pablo?

45:50.457 --> 45:51.875
What's going on, brother?

45:53.877 --> 45:55.212
Mr. Escobar...

45:56.588 --> 45:59.591
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

46:04.430 --> 46:07.224
Eat. Shit.

46:10.102 --> 46:11.812
What if I shot you in the head?

46:26.952 --> 46:29.913
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

46:32.374 --> 46:35.377
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.755
We're DAS, Ibarra.

46:39.882 --> 46:41.842
What's that faggot gonna do?

46:45.387 --> 46:46.847
There we are.

46:46.930 --> 46:48.724
No, lower, lower.

46:48.807 --> 46:50.142
No that low.

46:52.686 --> 46:53.854
Ready.

46:58.775 --> 47:00.777
Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

47:15.083 --> 47:16.710
Remove the handcuffs.

47:22.508 --> 47:24.092
You can go now, officer.

47:25.552 --> 47:27.095
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

47:33.435 --> 47:36.230
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

47:38.148 --> 47:43.153
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

47:43.904 --> 47:46.323
And you only gave us $150,000.

47:47.866 --> 47:50.452
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

47:51.411 --> 47:53.497
You know something?

47:53.580 --> 47:56.625
I make deals for a living.

47:56.708 --> 48:01.755
Now, you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

48:05.467 --> 48:08.637
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

48:08.720 --> 48:11.265
and everyone goes home happy.

48:13.809 --> 48:14.935
Deal?

48:23.110 --> 48:25.487
I'll give you one million dollars.

48:26.989 --> 48:29.074
Under one condition.

48:30.701 --> 48:31.994
What is it?

48:34.079 --> 48:37.958
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

48:39.126 --> 48:41.336
Otherwise, how would you know?

48:45.173 --> 48:47.259
Give me a name.

48:49.469 --> 48:52.639
And you won't have
to split the cash with him.

53:04.349 --> 53:06.810
No, no, no! No, Pablo, no, no!

53:06.893 --> 53:07.894
No, no!

53:18.071 --> 53:19.990
Leave this piece of shit here.

55:20.986 --> 55:22.654
Look at what happened, boss.

55:23.655 --> 55:25.991
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

55:28.827 --> 55:31.871
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

55:31.955 --> 55:35.083
And there was a gringo
DEA agent taking pictures.

55:39.170 --> 55:41.840
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

55:44.092 --> 55:47.721
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

55:47.804 --> 55:49.264
Half a million?

55:49.347 --> 55:50.557
Do it.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.142
As you wish, sir.

55:57.522 --> 55:59.399
Fucking gringos.
