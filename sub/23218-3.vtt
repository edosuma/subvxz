in its face?

JOSH:
Compensate much?

00:28.396 --> 00:30.030
Ah, he only turns ten once.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.532
And what ten-year-old
doesn't want

00:31.565 --> 00:33.534
-a sushi chef
at his birthday party? -Cam!

00:33.567 --> 00:35.703
-Eh, maybe I'm
overcompensating a little bit.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.905
He's dealing with a lot lately.

00:37.938 --> 00:40.208
Man, this wind is awful, huh?

00:40.241 --> 00:41.209
JOSH:
Santa Anas.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.111
Makes my allergies go crazy.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.148
Cam! You having fun?

00:49.083 --> 00:50.218
His mother's turning him

00:50.251 --> 00:52.386
-against me. Undermining.
-I told you

00:52.420 --> 00:54.222
-to give her more in the divorce
settlement. -That money pays her

00:54.255 --> 00:56.090
-to be cool.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.828
This wind. Dan, do you mind
holding your son?

01:03.597 --> 01:06.434
-Excuse me.
-Danny!

01:10.271 --> 01:12.740
-Coming in!
-Dad, you-you're too big.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.108
Ah!

01:14.142 --> 01:15.776
Come on!

01:15.809 --> 01:17.578
Yeah!

01:20.281 --> 01:21.782
-Yeah.

01:23.151 --> 01:26.254
:
Whoa!

01:26.287 --> 01:28.589
Want more? -We do!

01:28.622 --> 01:30.524
-Yeah.

01:32.960 --> 01:33.961
Whoa.

01:37.698 --> 01:41.034
-DAN: Cameron!

01:51.512 --> 01:52.813
-Cam!

02:31.385 --> 02:33.654
HEN: Adult male, down,
on the hillside.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.656
We got three kids
in a bouncy house.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.225
All right, we're gonna stage
the trucks on that service road.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.559
Hen, I want you and Buck
to rappel down,

02:38.592 --> 02:40.661
anchor that bouncy house.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.663
Assess the condition of those
kids, start to send them down

02:42.696 --> 02:44.998
one-by-one in a basket.
I'll take care of the dad.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.700
Chimney, you're gonna stay
up here and work the winch.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.836
Hey. How come I never get
to do any of the fun stuff?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.338
Working the winch is fun.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.566
HEN :
Bouncy house secure, Chim.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.700
Copy.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.707
Help!

03:26.740 --> 03:28.709
Hey, guys? Hey!
Hey, guys, we're...

03:28.742 --> 03:30.411
We're L.A. Fire and Rescue.
We're gonna get you out of here,

03:30.444 --> 03:31.945
okay? Everybody, just stay calm.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.781
HEN: Hey, boys, can you tell
if your friend here is okay?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.916
Is he awake

03:37.618 --> 03:39.920
-BUCK: Lower the basket down,
Chim. -Copy.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.992
Is my dad okay?

03:47.328 --> 03:48.896
-DAN: Cameron...
-Sir.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.731
Sir, do not move your head.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.733
Stay still. We'll get you out
of here as soon as we can.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.067
DAN:
Cameron...

04:00.107 --> 04:02.175
-BUCK: Chim, little lower.
-Copy.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.946
Boys, come on, let's go. Now.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.848
BUCK: All right, that's it.
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.851
All right,
basket coming in, Hen.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.757
Hen's going down.
She's got one kid, come on.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.594
-All right.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.464
Chim, we're good. Take me down.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.604
BP and heart rate stable.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.440
Vitals are stable.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.641
Dad?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.309
-Dad!
-Dan!

04:35.343 --> 04:36.777
-I thought you were dead.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.812
I'm okay, Cam.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.448
We're both okay.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.949
Love you so much.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.784
I love you so much, too.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.453
It's okay.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.287
Everything is gonna be okay.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.123
Had us worried, there.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.164
We're good down here.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.632
You can pack it up topside.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.335
Nice work at the winch.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.671
Thanks.

05:15.516 --> 05:19.019
May. May. May.
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.988
Come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on. Wake up.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.155
May!

05:36.437 --> 05:39.206
Mom. Mom!

05:39.239 --> 05:40.674
What's wrong with May?

05:40.708 --> 05:43.176
Honey. Honey, honey, honey.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.178
Your sister isn't
feeling well, okay?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.014
I need you to go next door
to the Johnsons.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.182
Call your father, tell him to
meet me at the hospital, okay?

05:49.216 --> 05:50.217
-Yeah.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.685
All right.
Lock the door.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.887
I have to go and ride
with your sister.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.398
Pulse is weak and thready.
What did she take?

06:04.432 --> 06:07.735
Uh... hydrocodone.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.103
Uh, do you know how many pills
she took, the dosage?

06:10.137 --> 06:12.706
They were mine from last year.
I had some dental work done

06:12.740 --> 06:14.742
but didn't finish the bottle.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.977
Maybe six or seven were left,
I-I-I don't know.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.613
Pupils aren't responding.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.749
She's a six on the GCS, fading.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.216
Oh...

06:26.487 --> 06:29.222
Mommy's right here, baby.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.092
It's okay.
I'm right here.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.562
Can you hear me?

06:34.595 --> 06:39.099
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.068
You're gonna be okay.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.270
They're gonna take
good care of you.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.673
You be strong
for me now, okay?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.790
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

07:10.130 --> 07:13.767
Athena. What's up?
You're not answering your phone.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.335
I-I rushed out so fast,
I forgot it.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.270
Okay, well, what happened?

07:17.304 --> 07:19.607
She took a bunch of pills.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.343
On purpose?
Well, what did she take?

07:23.376 --> 07:25.779
-Hydrocodone.
-Okay, can...

07:25.813 --> 07:28.682
-No... she's still in ICU.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.685
They said maybe
half an hour or so.

07:31.719 --> 07:34.287
I need to sit down.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.895
:
Ah...

07:47.334 --> 07:49.670
Oh, God, this is my fault.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.642
You were right, you were...
you were right.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.143
I shouldn't have told them.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.678
They weren't ready.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.653
Did she seem this upset to you?

08:05.686 --> 08:08.488
I mean, I-I know it's... hard.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.524
But this hard?

08:10.558 --> 08:12.492
When is the last time

08:12.526 --> 08:15.495
we didn't know exactly
what May was feeling?

08:15.529 --> 08:18.331
Sh-- well, she's a teenager now.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.333
I-I just, you know,
maybe we weren't,

08:20.367 --> 08:21.869
uh, paying enough attention.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.370
-I just-- I don't know, but...
-Okay, all right,

08:23.403 --> 08:25.372
let's-let's not do this
right now, okay?

08:27.407 --> 08:29.176
:
Okay.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.345
Okay.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.125
H

08:50.230 --> 08:52.265
Uh... we...

08:52.299 --> 08:54.568
we were having dinner, and he...
and-and he drove me here.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.473
I'm sorry. He was...
he was just worried about me.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.447
Uh...

09:07.480 --> 09:09.750
I-I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.921
Yeah, okay.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.671
*

09:55.863 --> 09:57.798
*

10:24.992 --> 10:27.795
The last time
she was in a hospital bed,

10:27.828 --> 10:30.363
I was lying in it with her,

10:30.397 --> 10:32.199
feeding her.

10:32.232 --> 10:36.804
Yeah. It was just
an hour and a half of labor.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.641
We almost didn't make it
to the hospital.

10:45.178 --> 10:48.648
She was so damn eager
to get into this world.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.321
MAY :
Mom?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.057
Baby. Hey.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.859
Dad's here, too.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.327
Hey, sweetheart.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.163
I'm sorry. I was stupid.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.899
No, you're not stupid, honey.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.167
You're a young girl.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.736
Being young is hard, honey.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.671
MICHAEL: And I'm the one
that should be sorry.

11:11.705 --> 11:15.408
I didn't see
how much you were suffering

11:15.442 --> 11:18.011
with all of the stuff at home.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.579
About me.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.115
This wasn't
because of you, Daddy.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.352
Things have been going on.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.354
I didn't want
to tell you about them,

11:27.387 --> 11:29.222
because I was trying
to handle it by myself.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.191
What kind of things, honey?

11:31.224 --> 11:34.227
A boy?
-No.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.929
Bunch of girls.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.031
Mostly this one, Layla.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.700
I don't know why they chose me.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.771
I think because I was talking
to a boy she likes,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.773
and they decided
to gang up on me.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.775
And they kept saying
"you're nothing"

11:47.808 --> 11:50.577
and "you're the worst" and
"you should go kill yourself"

11:50.610 --> 11:53.213
and "no one would care if you
did" and "you should die."

11:53.246 --> 11:55.949
You know none of that is true,
don't you, honey?

11:55.983 --> 11:57.751
You are a special,

11:57.785 --> 11:59.219
bright light in the world.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.921
-MICHAEL: Mm-hmm.
-No, I'm not.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.924
You guys got to say that
'cause you're my parents.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.793
I hate my life.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.228
I'm weird.
I have no friends.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.597
What about Georgina

12:10.630 --> 12:12.599
You two are
thick as thieves, now.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.067
Not anymore.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.603
She's with Layla now.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.571
I didn't want to die.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.974
It hurt so much, but I swear
I didn't want to die.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.243
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.245
Now, you listen to me.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.147
You're strong,
you're courageous,

12:27.180 --> 12:30.083
you're a champion,
and you are May Grant.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.285
And you are filled
with holy fire,

12:32.319 --> 12:34.822
and no one messes with you.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.824
No, you're not alone anymore.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.826
And those girls?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.161
They done picked
the wrong family.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.830
The wrong family.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.966
WOMAN:
Excuse me. Mr. and Mrs. Grant?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.101
I'm Karen Williams.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.503
I work for
Child Protective Services.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.505
I'm going to have to ask you

12:52.539 --> 12:54.942
not to say anything else
in your daughter's presence.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.543
MICHAEL:
Athena, what is this?

12:57.845 --> 12:59.813
When a child attempts suicide,

12:59.847 --> 13:02.615
then they need to go through an
independent assessment protocol

13:02.649 --> 13:04.451
to determine why,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.820
and if they're at risk
to try it again.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.656
Okay, but we can tell you
what the cause is.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.992
No, they need
to talk to her alone,

13:12.025 --> 13:14.461
find out if it had anything
to do with us.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.297
WILLIAMS: She will be admitted
tonight, put on 24-hour watch,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.799
-and evaluated in the morning.
-MAY: I don't want to stay here.

13:19.833 --> 13:20.968
I want to go home!

13:21.001 --> 13:22.335
-Shh... -WILLIAMS:
The evaluation may take

13:22.369 --> 13:24.337
a couple of days,
but we will notify you

13:24.371 --> 13:27.040
if we have to move her,
and what facility

13:27.074 --> 13:28.708
-she will be housed in.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.643
You listen.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.846
This girl just endured

13:32.880 --> 13:34.982
a life-altering trauma.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.649
She needs to be home

13:36.683 --> 13:39.752
-with her family. -Look,
you don't need to do this.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.189
You're a police officer.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.324
You know what
I'm authorized to do

13:44.357 --> 13:46.326
-if you don't let me do my job.
-Mama, please.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.028
-Please don't leave me.
-All right.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.030
-Don't go.
-Look, look, look, calm down.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.165
All right, we all have
to follow the rules.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.502
They... they just want
to find out that you're okay.

13:55.535 --> 13:59.172
All right? Now, you tell them
everything, you understand?

13:59.206 --> 14:03.010
You're safe, and you'll be home
with us in no time.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.045
Can you be brave for me?

14:05.078 --> 14:08.515
All right, I need you to be
braver than you've ever been.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.518
All right. That's my girl.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.121
That's my girl. Love you.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.358
-All right, I love you.
-I love you, too.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.293
MICHAEL:
I love you, baby.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.072
*

14:35.408 --> 14:37.410
This is not right!

14:37.444 --> 14:41.248
-It's just not right.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. Michael.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.217
Now, look, my family
is everything to me.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.253
And there ain't no trouble
from the inside,

14:46.286 --> 14:50.257
or even from the outside,
that's gonna tear it apart.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.426
Now, we may be buried in it
up to our necks right now,

14:53.460 --> 14:55.262
and I may want to slap you

14:55.295 --> 14:57.064
with my left hand,
but my right hand

14:57.097 --> 14:59.066
is holding you
and the kids tight.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.769
Now, I'm gonna make a couple
of calls to some cops I know

15:02.802 --> 15:05.405
down at the CPS facility
where they're taking May.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.340
She's gonna be okay.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.278
Come on, let's go.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.646
-Home.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.648
Together.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.617
*

15:28.295 --> 15:30.330
Hey, uh, Tatiana?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.099
Do not come in here, okay?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.101
Not while I'm cooking, please.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.136
I kind of have this thing
when I'm cooking,

15:36.169 --> 15:38.305
if somebody's watching me.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.140
You know, I kind of get
stage fright, so...

15:42.976 --> 15:45.112
Listen, babe, you do not
have to convince me

15:45.145 --> 15:47.780
not to move while somebody else
does all the work.

15:47.814 --> 15:51.451
And it smells really good.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.121
-Oh. Thank you.
-Oh.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.456
I saw the videos of that jumpy
house flying through the air

15:56.489 --> 15:59.192
on the news. I cannot believe
anybody survived that.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.994
-Oh, yeah, me neither.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.796
TATIANA:
Yeah.

16:03.830 --> 16:08.501
You know, uh, when we were
rappelling down to, uh,

16:08.535 --> 16:11.304
anchor the house and assess
the condition of the kids,

16:11.338 --> 16:12.972
we were pretty sure
we were gonna find

16:13.006 --> 16:14.307
a body or two in there.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.343
Is it terrible that the phrase

16:16.376 --> 16:19.512
"when we were rappelling down"
turns me on so much?

16:26.353 --> 16:30.990
And dinner is served.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.459
("Fade into You" by Mazzy Star
playing)

16:32.492 --> 16:36.996
Well, you cook...
you rappel down cliffs.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.165
Mm-hmm.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.533
You're a keeper, Chimney.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.535
* I wanna take a breath...

16:43.770 --> 16:45.505
Well, then, I think

16:45.538 --> 16:47.574
you will like
what I have for dessert.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.209
Ooh.

16:51.278 --> 16:54.214
* And I see nothing...

16:59.552 --> 17:02.855
Tatiana, I love you.

17:02.889 --> 17:06.693
And I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.696
Will you please marry me?

17:09.729 --> 17:13.066
* You go in shadows...

17:13.100 --> 17:16.569
Chimney, it's beautiful.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.771
And you are a beautiful man.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.740
* And you'll go blind... *

17:20.773 --> 17:22.242
I can't tell if that's a yes.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.077
-It's not.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.879
But it's not a no, I just...

17:26.913 --> 17:29.616
I wasn't prepared
for this at all.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.219
Okay, it's just,
it's such a surprise.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.056
* Colors your eyes...

17:37.090 --> 17:39.126
I-I thought
this was what you wanted.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.893
You should've asked me
before you did this.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.895
You wanted me to ask you
to ask you to marry me?

17:42.929 --> 17:45.265
-I don't...
-I was engaged before.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.801
I cheated on him
a week before the wedding.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.437
I have issues with commitment.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.905
And I just want to be
really, really sure,

17:52.939 --> 17:55.108
so that I don't hurt you
like I hurt Ted.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.309
St-- wait, wait,
whoa, wait, wait.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.578
So-so, so you were engaged
before?

17:58.611 --> 18:01.914
Look, if I say no,
we have to break up.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.751
A relationship can't handle
a rejection like that.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.419
Okay. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, uh...

18:06.453 --> 18:09.622
All that I'm really asking you
to do is to just

18:09.656 --> 18:11.924
keep doing what we're doing.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.926
Which you love.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.163
For the rest of our lives,
it-it's really--

18:16.196 --> 18:17.297
it's not that complicated.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.870
Just... give me a few days.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.307
Of course.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.775
Y-Yes.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.111
Sure, of course.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.446
HEN: Right here, right here,
right here.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.814
-Turn left!
-BUCK: I'm trying!

18:34.847 --> 18:36.649
Oh, oh, so you're fleeing
the scene?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.351
You do realize that you lose
points for murdering people

18:38.385 --> 18:39.786
-on the way to a fire.
-It should be fine.

18:39.819 --> 18:40.853
It's a flesh wound. Obamacare.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.455
What?

18:42.489 --> 18:44.824
What? Hen! Please--
someone call HR! No-- Hen!

18:44.857 --> 18:47.160
Ridic... Chimney!

18:47.194 --> 18:49.729
Here. You're up.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.301
BUCK:
Aw, man.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.535
HEN:
Hey. What's...

18:55.568 --> 18:57.370
what's wrong

18:57.404 --> 18:59.572
Look, Chim, if there's something
you want to talk about...

19:04.010 --> 19:06.979
I'm a good

19:07.013 --> 19:10.183
I mean, like, you can do
a lot worse than me

19:10.217 --> 19:12.151
Chimney, I've done
a whole lot worse than you.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.487
Buck.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.823
You think I'd be a good father?

19:16.856 --> 19:19.025
Of course, Chim.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.193
What is this about?

19:22.229 --> 19:24.197
I asked Tatiana to marry me.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.865
What?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.900
-HEN: Um...

19:27.934 --> 19:29.902
-CHIMNEY:
First, she said she cheated

19:29.936 --> 19:32.839
on a fiancé that I didn't even
know about, and that now

19:32.872 --> 19:35.675
we need to break up, then
she said she didn't know. I...

19:35.708 --> 19:37.510
Did you offer her the option
of an open marriage?

19:37.544 --> 19:39.011
It's super modern.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.680
Buck.

19:40.713 --> 19:41.848
Chim...

19:41.881 --> 19:43.883
I'm sorry.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.518
That may not have been the
response you that you hoped for,

19:45.552 --> 19:47.520
but it's not no.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.721
It might as well be.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.923
Probably for the best.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.859
What was that?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.594
Nothing. I'm sorry.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.196
I... I didn't mean anything
by that. You doing okay?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.865
Of course you meant something
by it. "Probably for the best"?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.367
There's a lot
of meaning behind that.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.269
What, you don't...
you don't like her?

20:02.302 --> 20:04.237
I never said I don't like her.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.705
I don't like her for you.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.907
CHIMNEY:
And what does that even mean?

20:07.940 --> 20:10.443
No. Come on.
Come on with it, wise man,

20:10.477 --> 20:12.279
uh-- just say
what you want to say,

20:12.312 --> 20:14.213
'cause I'm getting real tired
of you standing there,

20:14.247 --> 20:15.782
just silently judging me
with that--

20:15.815 --> 20:17.884
yeah, right there,
with that smirk on your face.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.218
-You know, you're always
so quick... -Chim.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.254
to comment on everybody's life,

20:21.288 --> 20:23.723
but you completely shut down
whenever we ask you about yours.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.892
Why is that

20:25.925 --> 20:27.727
I mean, how long
have we worked together, Bobby?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.228
I know nothing about you.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.897
I've never even met
your wife and your kids.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.565
You know why? 'Cause all you do
is you sit there,

20:32.599 --> 20:34.934
brooding, staring
in that little book of yours.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.936
You know what?
You're upset, let's drop it.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.938
Oh, my God, Bobby. Come on,
just say it! What is it?

20:38.971 --> 20:40.273
-Say it! -All right,
you're living a lie, man!

20:42.108 --> 20:43.075
You let her manipulate you.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.744
You pretend to be

20:44.777 --> 20:46.446
somebody you're not
when you're around her.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.914
Making up stories to satisfy

20:47.947 --> 20:49.749
some hero fetish of hers?
What is that?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.918
You know what? Maybe I wouldn't
have to make up stories

20:51.951 --> 20:54.487
if every once in a while, you
let me take point on something.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.324
I have to operate
the winch, right?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.091
And The Maneuver?
I can do The Maneuver.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.127
BOBBY: I know you can.
That's not the point here.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.096
Chimney, this relationship that
you're in is fueled by lies.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.333
Come on.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.934
Y-You asked me
to make you two dinner

21:07.967 --> 21:10.136
so you could pass it off
as your own.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.973
She's not in love with you.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.443
She's in love with
this fantasy version of you.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.478
You know what?
I feel real bad for your wife.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.679
I really do.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.947
Must be tough living with
someone

21:20.980 --> 21:22.715
who thinks he's right
all the time.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.621
-Chim.
-I'm getting some air.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.663
* Woman, you know, woman

21:36.696 --> 21:39.298
* You gotta be, woman

21:39.332 --> 21:41.300
* I've got the feeling of love

21:41.334 --> 21:42.802
* When you're talking to me

21:42.835 --> 21:45.304
* See right through me

21:45.338 --> 21:46.973
* I've got the feeling
of alone... *

21:47.006 --> 21:48.140
Call Tatiana.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.845
TATIANA: You've reached Tatiana.
Please leave a message.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.483
* She's gonna set you free

21:56.516 --> 21:59.051
* Yeah, yeah

21:59.085 --> 22:00.252
Come on.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.159
* You've come looking for me

22:07.193 --> 22:08.495
* Like I've got
to set you free *

22:08.528 --> 22:11.664
* You know I can't free nobody

22:13.866 --> 22:15.835
* Like I've got
to set you free *

22:15.868 --> 22:17.504
* I can't be nobody

22:18.905 --> 22:20.740
Oh, my!

23:00.580 --> 23:03.115
Hello.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.552
Who is this?

23:05.585 --> 23:08.054
Okay.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.556
All right, everybody,
let's gear up!

23:09.589 --> 23:11.458
Let's go, let's go!

23:11.491 --> 23:13.059
For what? I didn't hear a bell.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.226
It's Chimney.

23:14.260 --> 23:17.029
Come on. Hustle up.
Hustle up, everybody, let's go!

23:19.799 --> 23:21.934
MAN : Ladder medic,
10-36, auto emergency.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.786
-Captain Nash.
-Yeah. Thanks for calling.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.253
Your guy's this way.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.823
He wouldn't let
anyone else touch him.

23:43.856 --> 23:47.927
You, uh... you might want
to prepare yourself, sir.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.962
Hang back, guys.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.104
Can I get in there?

23:58.137 --> 24:01.440
Hey, Chim.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.976
Bobby, I...

24:04.010 --> 24:07.279
can't move my neck.

24:09.315 --> 24:12.451
He's alert and talking, doesn't
appear to be in any pain.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.487
Got a piece of rebar
through his skull.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.688
How is that even possible?

24:15.722 --> 24:17.990
Oh, it's possible.
Brain tissue has no nociceptors.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.158
It can't feel pain.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.860
Okay, what about
the rest of his head?

24:20.893 --> 24:22.028
Well, he's in shock.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.863
Now, listen guys,
this hasn't registered yet.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.633
He knows he's pinned, but
that's it, so we got to be cool.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.201
So if this thing's right
between his eyes, can he see it?

24:29.235 --> 24:31.403
I don't know what he can see.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.044
Airways sound good.

24:38.077 --> 24:41.147
-Not much pain.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.183
Uh... I don't think there's
any spinal damage.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.219
I can feel my legs, but when
I try and move my head...

24:47.253 --> 24:48.354
HEN AND BUCK:
Don't.

24:48.387 --> 24:50.990
-BOBBY: Be still.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.059
Wh-Wh-Why aren't you guys, like,
cutting me out of here?

24:53.092 --> 24:54.226
-It's complicated.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.162
-You've been injured, Chim.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.429
It's not good.

24:59.431 --> 25:01.167
-Well, I want to see it.
-No, you don't.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.836
-Yeah, I do. Bobby, show me.
-All right.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.514
Are you ready?

25:15.548 --> 25:17.784
-Show it to me.
-All right.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.693
Holy crap.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.897
How come I'm not dead?

25:30.930 --> 25:33.399
Because you are the luckiest and
the unluckiest son of a bitch

25:33.432 --> 25:35.868
on the face of the earth
all at the same time.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.870
Hey, uh, you guys,

25:37.904 --> 25:40.272
-I can't even feel this.
-I know.

25:40.306 --> 25:43.109
All right, well, please get me
out of here before I start to...

25:43.142 --> 25:44.711
All right, we're working on it.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.713
Normally, I'd be consulting
with my smartest EMT,

25:46.746 --> 25:48.981
but right now he's got a rebar
stuck in his head.

25:56.756 --> 26:00.159
Nice and tight, right?
All right.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.765
-Yeah.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.567
BOBBY:
All right, can you move?

26:08.601 --> 26:10.236
Not a bit.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.805
Good. All right, Buck.

26:20.613 --> 26:21.614
CHIMNEY:
Hey, Buck.

26:21.648 --> 26:25.251
How's the car, man?
Is it a total loss?

26:25.284 --> 26:29.989
Nah, man, you...
probably buff most of that out.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.358
Good.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.361
Good.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.661
Let's get O.R. 3 prepped for
a decompressive hemicraniotomy.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.806
We'll take him from here.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.174
Wha... No, w-we're
not leaving his side.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.976
Are you family?

27:24.010 --> 27:28.480
Buck, our job ends here
at these doors like always.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.604
*

28:19.065 --> 28:21.267
-Oh, it's on too tight.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.035
Hmm.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.772
What is

28:25.805 --> 28:27.706
That's the perfume you like.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.909
But I don't wear perfume.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.410
Oh, sure you do, Pat.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.079
You always smell wonderful.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.247
Look, Mom.

28:35.281 --> 28:40.152
See? It's your favorite one.
Sniff.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.998
Oh...

28:56.836 --> 28:57.937
Is...

28:57.970 --> 28:59.005
someone having a birthday?

29:04.777 --> 29:08.014
-I got it. I got it.
-Okay.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.786
She seems
a little cantankerous today.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.922
I know.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.290
She's not always like that.
I think, you know,

29:18.324 --> 29:20.092
big event like this...

29:20.126 --> 29:23.963
-it's a little overwhelming for
her.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.798
You look tired, Abby.

29:25.832 --> 29:28.267
-Oh my-- shut up.
-Well...

29:28.300 --> 29:30.336
That's a very rude thing
to say to a woman.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.337
-Didn't mean it...
-That's rude.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.604
I'm-- I-I am worried about you.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.941
-Don't... -She's only gonna
get worse, you know.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.308
I mean, i-it's progressive.

29:36.342 --> 29:39.278
Yes, I'm familiar with
what happens with Alzheimer's.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.612
I've done the reading.

29:40.646 --> 29:44.516
Yeah, well.

29:44.550 --> 29:48.320
-Read this.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.356
It's a brochure
for a memory care facility.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.025
I put Mom's name on a list,
and a room has opened up.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.494
You put her on a list
for a memory care facility

29:55.527 --> 29:56.963
without asking me?

29:56.996 --> 29:58.464
Because I knew
what you would say.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.132
You don't know
what I was gonna say.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.300
"I can handle this, Matt."

30:01.333 --> 30:02.801
Well, I can handle it, Matt.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.336
And I know you can
and you have been,

30:04.370 --> 30:06.973
and I don't tell you enough, but
you are a saint for doing it.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.975
I'm not a saint. I'm a daughter.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.543
A saintly daughter.
-Oh, come on.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.146
Who got the short end
of the stick

30:14.180 --> 30:16.148
because you're not married,
you don't have any kids.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.383
-It's not fair.
-Oh, my God.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.651
Stop it. No.
It's because I made a choice

30:19.685 --> 30:21.687
that I want to take care
of my mother. Okay?

30:21.720 --> 30:25.224
And-and I've never
complained about it, not once.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.726
Saints don't complain.
They suffer.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.228
I'm not suffering.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.830
This is my choice.
It's important to me.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.499
And, you know, I have the means.

30:33.532 --> 30:37.236
I have a really good job,
she gets benefits, you help out.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.504
-We're doing this.

30:38.537 --> 30:39.671
We're fine.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.840
But are you living?

30:41.874 --> 30:42.875
Matt.

30:42.909 --> 30:46.012
I mean it, Abby. It's just...

30:46.045 --> 30:47.679
You had something
with Tommy before.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.082
And ever since Mom has
been here, you've been alone.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.384
You got to start
thinking about yourself.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.686
And Mom's gonna need a facility
like this at some point.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.389
Just take a tour.
That's all I'm asking.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.864
BUCK:
It's been, like, 14 hours.

31:05.898 --> 31:09.535
How long's it take to pull a rod
out of a guy's skull, anyway?

31:09.568 --> 31:12.404
You ever heard of that saying,
"It ain't brain surgery"?

31:12.438 --> 31:14.406
Well, this is.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.043
What's 3 across
for when doubled in...?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.444
Just got off the phone
with the surgeon.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.280
-He's alive.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.883
-Yeah.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.585
Any... a

31:26.618 --> 31:28.955
There were some complications
when they took the rebar out.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.589
He started hemorrhaging.

31:30.622 --> 31:31.890
They got the bleeding
under control,

31:31.924 --> 31:33.926
but had to put him
in a medically induced coma.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.296
They'll let us know
if his condition changes.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.565
You mean if he wakes up.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.403
Or if he doesn't.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.075
Yeah.

32:19.705 --> 32:20.872
Buck, get the tools.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.178
Yo, Hen.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.447
Is it wrong I was stoked
there was an emergency?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.815
I was climbing the walls
back at the house.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.483
We all were,
and, yeah, it's wrong.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.152
We're not here to blow
off steam. We're here to help.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.620
Truck is registered
out of Texas.

32:34.653 --> 32:35.988
We're still looking
for the driver.

32:36.022 --> 32:37.423
It's got to be
over 100 degrees in there.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.524
Buck!

32:38.557 --> 32:39.858
(knocking,
people speaking indistinctly)

32:49.335 --> 32:50.636
*

33:12.858 --> 33:14.860
-BOBBY: All right,

33:14.893 --> 33:16.328
get these people some water.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.164
I got him, I got him, I got him.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.232
BOBBY: All right, get these
people some water, come on.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.234
-Put it down. Hen. -BOBBY: All
right, this is truck 118.

33:22.268 --> 33:23.535
I'm gonna need as many
ambulances as we can.

33:23.569 --> 33:24.870
-Hurry up, come on.
-Chopper, too.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.072
We may have to medevac
a few of them.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.178
It's at least four and a half
hours to the Mexican border,

33:32.211 --> 33:33.745
if that's even
where they started.

33:33.779 --> 33:34.880
BUCK :
Come on.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.415
Ah, breathe.

33:36.448 --> 33:39.851
-Starting compressions.
-Go ahead.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.187
OFFICER: Get down,
all right, take it easy.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.354
All right, come on.
I know you can hear me.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.191
I need you to breathe for me,
okay

33:45.224 --> 33:46.392
Can you stand up?
Take my hand.

33:46.425 --> 33:47.926
Take my hand. Ready?

33:47.959 --> 33:50.229
-All right, go, go, go.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.930
Start helping 'em down, come on.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.367
:
Por favor, mijo.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.936
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

33:57.969 --> 34:00.038
All right, give me something.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.041
-Ah!

34:03.075 --> 34:05.244
Javi, Javi, good job, good job.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.713
Uh, uh... to-to-todo bien,
todo bien. All right?

34:19.625 --> 34:21.893
BUCK: Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

34:21.927 --> 34:23.095
There you go.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.133
BUCK: Here we go, here we go,
that's it.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.734
-OFFICER: Do me a favor,
please, please... -Hey!

34:28.767 --> 34:31.737
Dick! Where the hell
do you think you're going?

34:31.770 --> 34:33.439
Sick son of a bitch.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.574
Whole families
could have died in there.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.075
Someone with a badge and a gun

34:37.109 --> 34:39.645
want to put this trash
in custody

34:39.678 --> 34:41.079
Ooh, that was badass,
but I thought

34:41.113 --> 34:42.248
we weren't here
to blow off steam.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.650
You know what you can blow.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.518
Hen.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.826
Hey, uh, everything okay?

34:54.860 --> 34:57.095
ABBY:
You answered. You always answer.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.430
You're so sweet.

34:58.464 --> 34:59.831
Oh, no, everything's fine.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.667
Um, is this a bad time?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.769
Uh, no. I'm-I'm at a call,

35:03.802 --> 35:05.837
but I-I wanted to answer
and, you know, make sure...

35:05.871 --> 35:07.606
you're not out on the ledge
or something.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.807
Thank you.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.108
I can't believe
you're at a call.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.511
Um, I'm not on a ledge.

35:12.544 --> 35:16.014
But I'm in a windowsill.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.483
You're on a call.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.451
I'm letting you go.
Go back to work.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.819
We can talk later.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.321
Nah, come on, tell me.

35:22.354 --> 35:25.824
No, it's just my mom.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.859
My mom has Alzheimer's, did I
tell you that? I can't remember

35:27.893 --> 35:29.127
if I told you that or not.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.197
No, I, uh, I didn't know that.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.032
-Sorry.
-Um, thanks.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.302
And she's just...

35:36.335 --> 35:37.536
slipping, you know?

35:37.569 --> 35:39.171
She's getting worse, and I...

35:39.205 --> 35:41.640
I'm starting to feel

35:41.673 --> 35:42.874
like she might need more...

35:42.908 --> 35:45.844
than just me.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.813
More help. Professional help.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.515
Y

35:49.548 --> 35:52.984
Yeah. Although
even as you say it out loud,

35:53.018 --> 35:55.654
I'm paralyzed with guilt
at the thought of it.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.256
I mean, she's my mom. Right?

35:58.357 --> 36:02.027
Yeah, that's rough.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.995
Look, I don't...
I don't know a lot.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.564
But if there's one thing
I learned

36:05.597 --> 36:07.999
over the last 24 hours,

36:08.033 --> 36:09.501
the only thing that matters

36:09.535 --> 36:10.669
is family.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.671
Right.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.573
Yes.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.075
You're so right.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.510
Thank you.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.179
Yeah, you got it.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.881
Um...

36:22.914 --> 36:25.784
Look, I'll talk
to you soon. Okay?

36:40.799 --> 36:43.402
Tatiana. I'm Bobby.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.870
We spoke on the phone.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.439
Oh, yeah. Hi.

36:49.441 --> 36:53.211
Now I know why Chimney
always calls you Gary Cooper.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.381
I see you've had some visitors.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.249
Yeah.

36:57.283 --> 37:00.386
All day and last night, too.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.422
Is that normal, or is Chimney
just really popular?

37:03.455 --> 37:05.056
Firefighters are a brotherhood.

37:05.090 --> 37:07.626
Cops are the same way.

37:07.659 --> 37:08.894
One of us goes down,

37:08.927 --> 37:10.061
we make sure
the family's looked after.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.631
And I'm the family?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.266
I was hoping to convince you

37:14.300 --> 37:15.934
to come to the hospital
to visit him.

37:18.103 --> 37:20.339
I thought you said
that he wasn't awake.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.742
They're bringing him
out of his coma now.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.110
It'd be good if you were there.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.991
He asked me to marry him.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.127
I know.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.262
It's not right, you know.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.765
Putting me
in that kind of situation.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.601
Either I say yes

37:49.635 --> 37:51.470
-or I'm some kind of monster.
-You don't have to say yes.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.938
You just have
to come hold his hand.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.841
This is not about love,
it's about decency.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.609
That's my point.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.278
Anything I do now that isn't
being Florence Nightingale,

38:00.312 --> 38:01.647
it makes me look
like some kind of jerk.

38:03.815 --> 38:07.619
So, I hold his hand
when he wakes up.

38:07.653 --> 38:11.122
Then it's stay with him
until he's out of the hospital.

38:11.156 --> 38:12.958
And then it's
you can't break up with him

38:12.991 --> 38:15.627
until he can walk or talk again,

38:15.661 --> 38:17.363
and that's assuming
that he ever can.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.964
And you want me

38:18.997 --> 38:21.367
to just play like I'm in love
for how long?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.301
A month

38:26.004 --> 38:29.207
I am not a bad person.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.877
-I am just not in love with him.
-Tatiana.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.513
My friend is coming out
of a medically induced coma.

38:36.181 --> 38:39.150
I don't know
if he'll ever fully wake up.

38:39.184 --> 38:42.320
And if he does, I don't know
if he's gonna be able to talk

38:42.354 --> 38:44.990
or see or hear
or even remember who I am.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.192
I am not asking you

38:47.225 --> 38:49.027
to love him or marry him,
and I'm not judging you

38:49.060 --> 38:50.328
for your feelings. I'm not.

38:50.362 --> 38:53.331
I'm just saying he loves you.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.000
Misguided as he may be.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.068
And the only two things

38:57.102 --> 38:59.170
I can think of to help him
are to pray

38:59.204 --> 39:02.007
and to hope
that if you're with him,

39:02.040 --> 39:05.010
he'll feel that love for you

39:05.043 --> 39:07.379
and it will give him a reason
to fight his way back to us.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.183
I'm sorry.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.620
I just can't.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.063
ABBY:
Okay.

39:25.096 --> 39:28.033
Um, she's had her midday pills,

39:28.066 --> 39:29.768
except I think I might have used

39:29.801 --> 39:31.870
next week's day-of-the-week box
by accident.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.371
Would you mind
just checking on that?

39:33.405 --> 39:35.407
-We'll get it squared away.
-Thank you.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.245
Am I about to be out of a job?

39:40.278 --> 39:42.380
Oh.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.215
-No. My brother left that.
- Oh. Oh.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.451
This is a good place.

39:45.484 --> 39:46.618
-Mm-hmm.

39:46.652 --> 39:49.087
-Vacancies are rare.
-Huh.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.723
Are you considering it?

39:51.757 --> 39:54.760
I was for a minute.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.127
But then I thought, you know,

39:56.161 --> 39:58.964
as long as my mom
is still here with me...

39:58.997 --> 40:01.733
I want her
to be here with me.

40:08.306 --> 40:10.442
We're going, we're going.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.116
He's a tough nut.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.118
He's gonna be in this room
for a few days.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.786
Intubation tube is out,
obviously,

40:54.820 --> 40:55.954
but the catheter's still in.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.789
Can he hear us?

40:57.823 --> 41:00.158
I always treat them
like they can.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.960
All right, two minutes,

41:01.993 --> 41:03.895
and then I'm kicking you out.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.756
Hey, Chim.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.526
We're all here for you, buddy.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.168
H-Hey.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.236
I-I was thinking maybe
when you come back to work,

41:45.270 --> 41:48.540
um, you know, you should do
The Maneuver instead of me.

41:51.710 --> 41:55.013
To motivate him to get better.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.514
:
He can't do The Maneuver.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.516
Yeah, he can.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.251
Hey, Chim,
you can do The Maneuver.

42:00.285 --> 42:02.220
Right?

42:06.457 --> 42:09.060
Chim.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.862
I, um...

42:10.896 --> 42:13.531
I tried to get ahold
of your parents.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.035
There's a 16-hour
time difference with Seoul,

42:17.068 --> 42:18.369
you know, so maybe...

42:18.403 --> 42:20.972
maybe that has something
to do with it.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.216
BOBBY:
Yeah, it's all right.

42:32.317 --> 42:34.485
His family's right here.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.464
Please don't ever
let him do The Maneuver.

42:50.802 --> 42:52.738
