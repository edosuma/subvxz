00:32.936 --> 00:34.402
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.471 --> 00:35.470
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS FOR

00:35.539 --> 00:37.405
JOINING US.

00:37.474 --> 00:38.473
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:38.542 --> 00:39.740
BIDEN MET WITH XI JINPING, KING

00:39.809 --> 00:42.210
CHARLES CELEBRATED HIS 75TH

00:42.279 --> 00:43.711
BIRTHDAY WHILE LOOKING AT LEAST

00:43.780 --> 00:44.745
97, AND GEORGE SANTOS ANNOUNCED

00:44.814 --> 00:47.715
HE WOULDN'T BE SEEKING

00:47.784 --> 00:48.783
RE-ELECTION AFTER AN ETHICS

00:48.852 --> 00:50.118
COMMITTEE REPORT HE DISPUTES

00:50.187 --> 00:52.854
FOUND -- AMONG OTHER THINGS --

00:52.923 --> 00:53.688
HE'D USED CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FOR

00:53.757 --> 00:54.355
PERSONAL PURCHASES ON BOTOX,

00:54.424 --> 00:55.556
SEPHORA, AND ONLYFANS.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.091
AND HONESTLY?

00:57.160 --> 00:58.092
I LIKE HIM NOW, AND I THINK HE

00:58.161 --> 01:04.699
SHOULD STAY.

01:04.768 --> 01:05.500
MEANWHILE, ISRAEL'S AIRSTRIKES

01:05.569 --> 01:06.167
AND GROUND INVASION CONTINUED IN

01:06.236 --> 01:07.902
GAZA, AND THE DISCOURSE ON IT

01:07.971 --> 01:08.803
HERE REACHED ITS ABSOLUTE NADIR

01:08.872 --> 01:09.437
WHEN FOX BUSINESS WELCOMED FABIO

01:09.506 --> 01:10.538
FOR A 10-MINUTE INTERVIEW ON THE

01:10.607 --> 01:11.706
SUBJECT, INCLUDING THIS WILD

01:11.775 --> 01:14.175
DIGRESSION CONCERNING HAMAS.

01:14.244 --> 01:15.209
>> THESE PEOPLE, THEY FIND SO

01:15.278 --> 01:16.244
MUCH PLEASURE TO KILL, JUST THE

01:16.313 --> 01:18.146
WORST.

01:18.215 --> 01:20.515
10,000 TIMES WORSE THAN THE

01:20.584 --> 01:22.083
NAZIS, YOU KNOW?

01:22.152 --> 01:22.950
AND ALSO, THEY ADVERTISE, THEY

01:23.019 --> 01:24.585
PUBLICIZE, THEY ARE SO HAPPY,

01:24.654 --> 01:25.720
"HEY, I KILLED 10 JEW, I DID

01:25.789 --> 01:28.890
THAT" -- YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, AT

01:28.959 --> 01:29.490
LEAST THE NAZIS, THEY KEPT IT

01:29.559 --> 01:31.926
KIND OF QUIET.

01:31.995 --> 01:34.328
>> John: HOLD ON, FABIO.

01:34.397 --> 01:35.329
FAR BE IT FOR ME TO CONTRADICT A

01:35.398 --> 01:36.230
NOTED GEOPOLITICAL EXPERT AND

01:36.299 --> 01:37.098
FORMER "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT

01:37.167 --> 01:40.468
BUTTER" SPOKESPERSON, BUT -- "AT

01:40.537 --> 01:41.102
LEAST THE NAZIS KEPT IT KIND OF

01:41.171 --> 01:42.870
QUIET?"

01:42.939 --> 01:44.572
THE NAZIS KEPT IT MANY THINGS.

01:44.641 --> 01:45.306
THEY KEPT IT PUNCTUAL.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.842
THEY KEPT IT BLONDE.

01:47.911 --> 01:48.910
THEY KEPT IT HUMORLESS.

01:48.979 --> 01:51.579
AND YES, THEY KEPT IT TIGHT.

01:51.648 --> 01:52.313
THEY WERE WELL-TAILORED PIECES

01:52.382 --> 01:53.214
OF SHIT.

01:53.283 --> 01:54.715
BUT SUBTLETY WAS -- FAMOUSLY --

01:54.784 --> 01:58.653
NOT THEIR CALLING CARD, FABIO.

01:58.722 --> 01:59.320
BUT, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

01:59.389 --> 01:59.954
CONGRESS, WHICH BEFORE RECESSING

02:00.023 --> 02:01.923
THIS WEEK PASSED A CONTINUING

02:01.992 --> 02:03.324
RESOLUTION "TO KEEP THE

02:03.393 --> 02:03.925
GOVERNMENT OPEN" INTO THE NEW

02:03.994 --> 02:05.827
YEAR.

02:05.896 --> 02:09.530
BUT, IN THE RUNUP, THINGS GOT

02:09.599 --> 02:09.866
PRETTY WEIRD.

02:09.933 --> 02:10.965
FIRST, THERE WAS A TENSE

02:11.034 --> 02:11.999
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN OKLAHOMA

02:12.068 --> 02:13.267
SENATOR MARKWAYNE MULLIN, AND

02:13.336 --> 02:14.168
THE HEAD OF THE TEAMSTERS, SEAN

02:14.237 --> 02:14.637
O'BRIEN.

02:14.704 --> 02:15.205
THEY'D GONE BACK AND FORTH

02:15.272 --> 02:16.404
ONLINE A FEW MONTHS AGO, WITH

02:16.473 --> 02:17.038
O'BRIEN SAYING, "QUIT THE TOUGH

02:17.107 --> 02:17.705
GUY ACT IN THESE SENATE

02:17.774 --> 02:18.840
HEARINGS.

02:18.909 --> 02:19.375
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

02:19.442 --> 02:20.608
ANYPLACE, ANYTIME COWBOY.

02:20.677 --> 02:23.678

02:24.347 --> 02:26.180
BOX AT A DEBATE.

02:26.249 --> 02:27.315
WELL, THIS WEEK, MULLIN ANSWERED

02:27.384 --> 02:29.984
THAT CHALLENGE.

02:30.053 --> 02:31.185
>> SIR, THIS IS A TIME, THIS IS

02:31.254 --> 02:32.120
A PLACE.

02:32.189 --> 02:33.154
IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR MOUTH,

02:33.223 --> 02:34.589
WE CAN BE TWO CONSENTING ADULTS,

02:34.658 --> 02:35.656
WE CAN FINISH IT HERE.

02:35.725 --> 02:38.092
>> OKAY, THAT'S FINE, PERFECT.

02:38.161 --> 02:38.628
>> YOU WANT TO DO IT NOW?

02:38.695 --> 02:39.393
>> I'D LOVE TO DO IT RIGHT NOW.

02:39.462 --> 02:40.628
>> WELL STAND YOUR BUTT UP THEN.

02:40.697 --> 02:41.762
>> YOU STAND YOUR BUTT UP.

02:41.831 --> 02:42.530
[CROSSTALK]

02:42.599 --> 02:46.901
>> STOP IT, STOP IT.

02:46.970 --> 02:47.635
SIT DOWN -- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A

02:47.704 --> 02:49.937
UNITED STATES SENATOR.

02:50.006 --> 02:52.106
>> John: THAT VOICE WAS BERNIE

02:52.175 --> 02:53.407
SANDERS, AND RESPECTFULLY

02:53.476 --> 02:55.376
BERNIE, SHUT UP.

02:55.445 --> 02:56.444
I MEAN, IT IS NICE TO HEAR YOU

02:56.513 --> 02:58.012
CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE -- A LOT OF

02:58.081 --> 02:58.746
US THOUGHT YOU'D FORGOTTEN HOW

02:58.815 --> 02:59.747
TO DO THAT --

02:59.816 --> 03:01.949
BUT SHUT UP.

03:02.018 --> 03:03.151
I WANT TO SEE ANABOLIC JIM

03:03.220 --> 03:04.285
HALPERT GET HIS ASS HANDED TO

03:04.354 --> 03:04.886
HIM.

03:04.955 --> 03:05.486
BECAUSE, DO YOU KNOW WHO SEAN

03:05.555 --> 03:06.788
O'BRIEN IS?

03:06.857 --> 03:07.688
HE'S A FOURTH GENERATION BOSTON

03:07.757 --> 03:09.323
TEAMSTER.

03:09.392 --> 03:11.793
HE BASICALLY CAME OUT OF THE

03:11.862 --> 03:13.094
WOMB WEARING BRASS KNUCKLES.

03:13.163 --> 03:14.295
I WANT TO SEE SENATOR ANGER

03:14.364 --> 03:17.165
MANAGEMENT GET HIS JOCK ROCKED

03:17.234 --> 03:17.765
BY BEANTOWN'S MR. CLEAN.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.300
THAT'S WHAT I WANT!

03:19.369 --> 03:20.935
AND, WHILE BERNIE DID STOP THE

03:21.004 --> 03:22.036
FIGHTING, HE COULDN'T STOP THE

03:22.105 --> 03:23.571
PETTINESS.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.338
>> HE MADE A LOT OF STATEMENTS,

03:24.407 --> 03:25.673
RIGHT?

03:25.742 --> 03:26.307
AND, HIS STATEMENTS ARE FICTION,

03:26.376 --> 03:28.242
AT BEST.

03:28.311 --> 03:28.545
>> FICTION?

03:28.612 --> 03:32.413
I READ 'EM!

03:32.482 --> 03:33.247
>> [MOCKING NOISE]

03:33.316 --> 03:35.483
WHAT?

03:35.552 --> 03:37.084
>> ANSWER THE QUESTION, PLEASE.

03:37.153 --> 03:38.219
>> I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HIM, TO BE

03:38.288 --> 03:39.120
HONEST WITH YOU.

03:39.189 --> 03:39.689
>> John: THAT'S SO CHILDISH,

03:39.756 --> 03:41.189
IT'S ACTUALLY BRILLIANT.

03:41.258 --> 03:41.823
O'BRIEN'S GOT THE DEMEANOR OF A

03:41.892 --> 03:43.291
MOB BOSS, THE BODY OF A FIRE

03:43.360 --> 03:43.891
HYDRANT, AND THE INSULTS OF A

03:43.960 --> 03:44.892
FIVE YEAR OLD.

03:44.961 --> 03:45.493
AND AMAZINGLY, IT STILL WASN'T

03:45.562 --> 03:46.627
OVER.

03:46.696 --> 03:47.130
BECAUSE, MULLIN ACTUALLY

03:47.197 --> 03:48.429
CHALLENGED O'BRIEN TO A CHARITY

03:48.498 --> 03:51.432
FIGHT, AND LATER SAID THIS.

03:51.501 --> 03:52.001
>> I'M NOT AFRAID OF BITING.

03:52.068 --> 03:52.700
I WILL BITE.

03:52.769 --> 03:54.335
>> BITING?

03:54.404 --> 03:55.770
>> IF I'M IN A FIGHT, I'M GOING

03:55.839 --> 03:58.206
TO BITE, I'LL DO ANYTHING.

03:58.275 --> 03:59.440
I MEAN, I'M NOT ABOVE IT.

03:59.509 --> 04:00.074
AND, I DON'T CARE WHERE I BITE,

04:00.143 --> 04:00.510
BY THE WAY.

04:00.577 --> 04:02.110
IT JUST IS GONNA BE A BITE.

04:02.179 --> 04:02.710
>> John: YOU DON'T CARE WHERE

04:02.779 --> 04:05.413
YOU BITE?

04:05.482 --> 04:06.747
THERE'S SIMPLY NO OTHER WAY TO

04:06.816 --> 04:07.915
INTERPRET THAT THAN MULLIN'S

04:07.984 --> 04:09.217
GOING TO BITE HIM IN THE DICK.

04:09.286 --> 04:10.952
AND, HOW IS THAT TOUGH-GUY

04:11.021 --> 04:13.554
BEHAVIOR?

04:13.623 --> 04:14.455
"WATCH OUT, HE BITES," ISN'T

04:14.524 --> 04:15.690
WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT A SENATOR WHO

04:15.759 --> 04:16.891
EVERYONE RESPECTS: IT'S WHAT YOU

04:16.960 --> 04:18.025
SAY ABOUT A 3-YEAR-OLD NAMED

04:18.094 --> 04:19.026
DYLAN AFTER HE'S HAD TWO CAPRI

04:19.095 --> 04:22.263
SUNS.

04:22.332 --> 04:23.030
AND, THAT WASN'T CONGRESS'S ONLY

04:23.099 --> 04:24.198
FIGHT THIS WEEK.

04:24.267 --> 04:24.932
KEVIN MCCARTHY ALLEGEDLY ELBOWED

04:25.001 --> 04:26.200
TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE TIM

04:26.269 --> 04:27.335
BURCHETT IN THE BACK, WITH

04:27.404 --> 04:27.935
BURCHETT LATER RESPONDING, "I

04:28.004 --> 04:30.004
PRAYED FOR HIM THIS MORNING,

04:30.073 --> 04:31.472
BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S HURTING,"

04:31.541 --> 04:32.507
WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS SOUTHERN

04:32.576 --> 04:34.208
FOR "I HOPE THAT SHITBAG SITS ON

04:34.277 --> 04:36.444
A NAIL."

04:36.513 --> 04:37.078
AND, IN A HOUSE HEARING,

04:37.147 --> 04:38.746
KENTUCKY REP. JAMES COMER GOT

04:38.815 --> 04:39.480
INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH FLORIDA

04:39.549 --> 04:40.515
REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ, IN THE

04:40.584 --> 04:42.350
COURSE OF WHICH COMER DROPPED A

04:42.419 --> 04:45.119
WEIRDLY SPECIFIC INSULT.

04:45.188 --> 04:46.821
>> YOU ALL CONTINUE -- YOU LOOK

04:46.890 --> 04:48.990
LIKE A SMURF HERE JUST GOIN'

04:49.059 --> 04:51.392
AROUND AND ALL THIS STUFF.

04:51.461 --> 04:52.560
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU HAVE -- NO

04:52.629 --> 04:53.895
-- HOLD ON -- IF WE'RE NOT ON

04:53.964 --> 04:56.130
TIME --

04:56.199 --> 04:56.764
>> YOU CONTINUE TO SPEW

04:56.833 --> 04:58.900
DISINFORMATION.

04:58.969 --> 04:59.767
>> John: NOW, YOU MIGHT THINK

04:59.836 --> 05:01.102
IT'S COMPLETELY UNCALLED FOR:

05:01.171 --> 05:02.737
FOR AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE TO

05:02.806 --> 05:03.306
CALL A FELLOW CONGRESSMAN A

05:03.373 --> 05:04.739
SMURF.

05:04.808 --> 05:05.373
IN COMER'S DEFENSE, THIS IS HOW

05:05.442 --> 05:07.675
MOSKOWITZ WAS DRESSED THAT DAY.

05:07.744 --> 05:08.976
AND, I HATE TO SAY HE WAS ASKING

05:09.045 --> 05:11.846
FOR IT, BUT HE WAS KIND OF

05:11.915 --> 05:13.281
ASKING FOR IT.

05:13.350 --> 05:14.015
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO

05:14.084 --> 05:16.684
DRESS IN ALL BLUE UNLESS YOU

05:16.753 --> 05:17.318
"WANT" TO BE CALLED A SMURF, OR

05:17.387 --> 05:20.755
MAYBE YOU'RE THE SPECIAL GUEST

05:20.824 --> 05:21.622
AT A J.CREW SPONSORED GENDER

05:21.691 --> 05:22.690
REVEAL.

05:22.759 --> 05:23.624
MOSKOWITZ HIT BACK BY POSTING,

05:23.693 --> 05:24.525
"GARGAMEL WAS VERY ANGRY TODAY,"

05:24.594 --> 05:25.993
WHICH, I'LL BE HONEST, IS

05:26.062 --> 05:28.429
EXACTLY WHAT A SMURF WOULD SAY.

05:28.498 --> 05:29.530
AND, CNN'S ANALYSIS OF THE

05:29.599 --> 05:31.833
BACK-AND-FORTH CONTAINED THE

05:31.902 --> 05:33.234
AMAZING SENTENCE, "FOR THE MANY

05:33.303 --> 05:35.303
NON-AFFICIONADOS OF THE ANIMATED

05:35.372 --> 05:35.872
SERIES, GARGAMEL WAS AN EVIL

05:35.939 --> 05:37.138
WIZARD WHO HUNTED SMURFS FOR

05:37.207 --> 05:38.539
FUN," WHICH -- I'M SORRY, CNN --

05:38.608 --> 05:40.675
IS AN INSULTINGLY REDUCTIVE

05:40.744 --> 05:41.909
MISINTERPRETATION OF GARGAMEL'S

05:41.978 --> 05:42.910
MOTIVATIONS.

05:42.979 --> 05:44.879
FOR THE RECORD, GARGAMEL DOESN'T

05:44.948 --> 05:46.781
"HUNT" SMURFS: HE KIDNAPS THEM

05:46.850 --> 05:47.949
IN ORDER TO EAT THEM OR TURN

05:48.018 --> 05:49.450
THEM INTO GOLD.

05:49.519 --> 05:50.151
AND, IT'S NOT FOR FUN.

05:50.220 --> 05:52.253
IT IS TO SEEK REVENGE AFTER THE

05:52.322 --> 05:53.821
SMURFS NOT ONLY DEFEATED HIM,

05:53.890 --> 05:55.289
BUT SUBJECTED HIM TO CRUEL

05:55.358 --> 05:55.990
HUMILIATION IN 1961'S "THE

05:56.059 --> 05:57.959
SMURFNAPPER," OR "LE VOLEUR DE

05:58.028 --> 05:59.494
SCHTROUMPF," IN WHICH THE SMURFS

05:59.563 --> 06:00.328
TRICKED HIM INTO DRINKING A

06:00.397 --> 06:01.729
POTION THAT SHRANK HIM TO THE

06:01.798 --> 06:03.798
SIZE OF A SMURF.

06:03.867 --> 06:04.367
AND, CNN'S EXCLUSION OF THAT

06:04.434 --> 06:07.301
BACKSTORY IS, FRANKLY, WHY

06:07.370 --> 06:08.336
AMERICANS NO LONGER TRUST THE

06:08.405 --> 06:09.737
NEWS MEDIA.

06:09.806 --> 06:11.572
ALL IN ALL, IT WAS A WEEK THAT

06:11.641 --> 06:13.040
SHOWED A LEGISLATIVE BODY ON ITS

06:13.109 --> 06:14.675
LAST NERVE.

06:14.744 --> 06:15.376
AS A SPOKESPERSON FOR MITCH

06:15.445 --> 06:17.178
MCCONNELL PUT IT, "TODAY IS

06:17.247 --> 06:17.912
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHY CONGRESS

06:17.981 --> 06:20.281
SHOULDN'T BE IN SESSION FOR 5

06:20.350 --> 06:20.650
WEEKS STRAIGHT.

06:20.717 --> 06:22.717
WEIRD THINGS HAPPEN."

06:22.786 --> 06:23.885
TO WHICH I'D SAY "TOTALLY!"

06:23.954 --> 06:26.087
BUT ALSO, DID YOU KNOW THAT MOST

12:51.741 --> 12:54.442
ABOUT 20 FEET DOWN THAT WAY.

12:54.511 --> 12:56.310
>> MY GOD, WHY DOES MY DOLLAR

12:56.379 --> 12:58.279
TREE LOOK LIKE CACA?

12:58.348 --> 13:00.248
>> LOOK AT THIS DOLLAR TREE.

13:00.317 --> 13:02.917
LIKE, WHAT THE FUCK?

13:02.986 --> 13:04.485
>> John: YEAH, "WHAT THE FUCK"

13:04.554 --> 13:05.720
IS RIGHT.

13:05.789 --> 13:07.288
THOSE LOOK LESS LIKE FUNCTIONING

13:07.357 --> 13:08.356
STORES AND MORE LIKE "AMERICAN

13:08.425 --> 13:14.829
NINJA WARRIOR: RETAIL EDITION."

13:14.898 --> 13:15.730
THEY LOOK LIKE SOMEONE PICKED UP

13:15.799 --> 13:16.964
A DOLLAR STORE, SHOOK IT, AND

13:17.033 --> 13:17.698
DUMPED IT OUT INTO ANOTHER

13:17.767 --> 13:20.468
DOLLAR STORE.

13:20.537 --> 13:21.068
AND, A QUICK SHOUT OUT TO THE

13:21.137 --> 13:21.638
AUTOMATED TIKTOK VOICE THERE

13:21.705 --> 13:22.970
TRYING TO SAY THE WORD "CACA."

13:23.039 --> 13:23.838
SHE'S DOING HER ABSOLUTE BEST.

13:23.907 --> 13:24.472
THAT'S ALL WE CAN ASK OF HER --

13:24.541 --> 13:25.506
THAT AND MAYBE TO SAY NAUGHTY

13:25.575 --> 13:26.009
THINGS LIKE:

13:26.076 --> 13:27.108
>> PENIS.

13:27.177 --> 13:28.075
>> John: OR --

13:28.144 --> 13:28.545
>> VAGINA.

13:28.612 --> 13:29.644
>> John: OR --

13:29.713 --> 13:30.244
>> CHARLES MANSON WAS LOW-KEY

13:30.313 --> 13:31.245
HOT, IN A

13:31.314 --> 13:32.447
CHARACTER-ACTOR-GRIFFIN DUNNE

13:32.516 --> 13:33.714
KIND OF WAY.

13:33.783 --> 13:34.949
>> John: EXACTLY.

13:35.018 --> 13:35.716
BUT, TO AN EXTENT YOU MAY NOT

13:35.785 --> 13:38.653
REALIZE, THAT CHAOS ISN'T A

13:38.722 --> 13:39.287
ONE-OFF MISTAKE, OR THE FAULT OF

13:39.356 --> 13:40.755
THOSE STORES' EMPLOYEES: IT'S

13:40.824 --> 13:41.656
THE NATURAL END PRODUCT OF HOW

13:41.725 --> 13:43.357
THE COMPANIES BEHIND THESE

13:43.426 --> 13:44.992
STORES CHOOSE TO OPERATE THEM.

13:45.061 --> 13:46.727
AND, IF YOU THINK IT CAN BE BAD

13:46.796 --> 13:47.962
SHOPPING AT A DOLLAR STORE, IT'S

13:48.031 --> 13:48.830
NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT IT'S

13:48.899 --> 13:50.364
LIKE WORKING THERE.

13:50.433 --> 13:54.202
IT'S BEEN SAID THAT WORKING AT

13:54.271 --> 13:55.436
DOLLAR GENERAL MAY BE THE WORST

13:55.505 --> 13:57.271
RETAIL JOB IN AMERICA.

13:57.340 --> 13:59.407
AND, IF THESE STORES ARE THIS

13:59.476 --> 14:00.441
UBIQUITOUS, MAKE THIS MUCH

14:00.510 --> 14:01.909
MONEY, AND ARE THIS TERRIBLE TO

14:01.978 --> 14:03.311
WORK FOR, TONIGHT, AS WE GET

14:03.380 --> 14:03.911
READY FOR BLACK FRIDAY, LET'S

14:03.980 --> 14:05.179
TALK ABOUT DOLLAR STORES.

14:05.248 --> 14:05.813
AND, LET'S START WITH THE FACT

14:05.882 --> 14:08.082
THAT ONE OF THE KEY WAYS THEY

14:08.151 --> 14:08.683
SQUEEZE MARGINS ISN'T ON TINY

14:08.752 --> 14:12.120
SOAPS: IT'S ON LABOR COSTS.

14:12.189 --> 14:12.622
THEY OFTEN HAVE JUST TWO

14:12.689 --> 14:14.622
EMPLOYEES -- OR SOMETIMES EVEN

14:14.691 --> 14:16.858
ONE -- MANNING THE ENTIRE STORE.

14:16.927 --> 14:17.925
WATCH AS THIS DOLLAR TREE

14:17.994 --> 14:19.227
CUSTOMER DISCOVERS IN REAL TIME

14:19.296 --> 14:23.464
THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON

14:23.533 --> 14:23.967
WORKING THERE.

14:24.034 --> 14:27.835
>> ONLY WORKER HERE.

14:27.904 --> 14:28.204
>> ONLY WORKER.

14:28.271 --> 14:29.370
>> DOING THIS WITH NO SHELVES,

14:29.439 --> 14:29.672
NO NOTHING.

14:29.739 --> 14:32.373
LOOK AT THIS.

14:32.442 --> 14:36.477
SHE'S THE ONLY WORKER HERE.

14:36.546 --> 14:38.646
>> EVERYTHING, GUYS.

14:38.715 --> 14:40.181
THESE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN WORK

14:40.250 --> 14:44.385
HERE AND THEY'RE HELPING HER.

14:44.454 --> 14:45.319
LOOK AT THIS: WALLS OF BOXES,

14:45.388 --> 14:47.421
ALL BY HERSELF.

14:47.490 --> 14:49.724
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE THE

14:49.793 --> 14:51.659
STORES ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE THAT

14:51.728 --> 14:52.794
WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON

14:52.863 --> 14:53.861
THERE TO DO EVERYTHING.

14:53.930 --> 14:54.929
IT'S SO BAD, RANDOM DUDES ARE

14:54.998 --> 14:56.464
PITCHING IN TO HELP HER FOR

14:56.533 --> 14:57.000
FREE.

14:57.067 --> 14:57.899
IMAGINE HOW MONUMENTALLY SHITTY

14:57.968 --> 14:59.767
A STORE WOULD HAVE TO BE FOR

14:59.836 --> 15:00.768
YOU, A CUSTOMER, TO WALK IN AND

15:00.837 --> 15:06.841
SAY, "OH, FUCK, THEY NEED ME."

15:06.910 --> 15:11.312
IT REMINDS ME OF THAT FAMOUS MR.

15:11.381 --> 15:11.881
ROGERS QUOTE: "WHEN YOU WALK

15:11.948 --> 15:13.848
INTO A DOLLAR STORE THAT LOOKS

15:13.917 --> 15:14.482
LIKE CHERNOBYL AFTER THE BLAST,

15:14.551 --> 15:16.284
LOOK FOR THE HELPERS: YOU WILL

15:16.353 --> 15:17.418
ALWAYS FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE

15:17.487 --> 15:18.786
HELPING."

15:18.855 --> 15:21.622
AND, INCIDENTALLY, THE PEOPLE

15:21.691 --> 15:22.824
EMPLOYED BY DOLLAR STORES ARE

15:22.893 --> 15:24.025
NOT MAKING MUCH MORE THAN THOSE

15:24.094 --> 15:25.393
VOLUNTEER HELPERS.

15:25.462 --> 15:26.327
JUST WATCH AS A FORMER DOLLAR

15:26.396 --> 15:27.428
GENERAL WORKER POINTS OUT THE

15:27.497 --> 15:28.029
DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT THE TOP

15:28.098 --> 15:28.763
EXECS MAKE, AND WHAT THE

15:28.832 --> 15:29.697
RANK-AND-FILE DO.

15:29.766 --> 15:30.865
>> Y'ALL OUT THERE RIDING IN

15:30.934 --> 15:32.733
DAMN EXPENSIVE CARS.

15:32.802 --> 15:34.302
Y'ALL CAN GO OUT, EAT CRABS AND

15:34.371 --> 15:35.803
STEAK AND FILET MIGNON AND

15:35.872 --> 15:38.106
ESCARGOT AND ALL THIS SHIT.

15:38.175 --> 15:39.640
MEANWHILE, Y'ALL WORKERS ARE

15:39.709 --> 15:41.576
EATING RAMEN NOODLES.

15:41.645 --> 15:42.743
COME ON NOW.

15:42.812 --> 15:44.479
Y'ALL MAKING MILLIONS.

15:44.548 --> 15:45.213
THINK ABOUT IT.

15:45.282 --> 15:46.180
I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT

15:46.249 --> 15:47.715
IT.

15:47.784 --> 15:49.283
LET ME KNOW: WHEN DID A DOLLAR

15:49.352 --> 15:50.885
GENERAL WORKER MAKE MORE THAN

15:50.954 --> 15:52.753
$20,000 IN A WHOLE YEAR?

15:52.822 --> 15:56.023
DON'T WORRY, I'LL WAIT.

15:56.092 --> 15:59.927
>> John: EXCELLENT.

15:59.996 --> 16:00.761
I'VE NEVER HEARD A HARSHER

16:00.830 --> 16:02.597
INSULT THAN SIMPLY LISTING OUT

16:02.666 --> 16:03.431
FOODS YOU ASSUME SOMEONE ELSE

16:03.500 --> 16:04.799
EATS: "CRABS, STEAK, FILET

16:04.868 --> 16:05.433
MIGNON, ESCARGOT, AND ALL THIS

16:05.502 --> 16:07.335
SHIT."

16:07.404 --> 16:07.969
SHE'S DESCRIBING A CARTOON RICH

16:08.038 --> 16:09.804
PERSON, AND IT'S DEVASTATING.

16:09.873 --> 16:10.404
I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE'D TAKE ONE

16:10.473 --> 16:11.939
LOOK AT ME AND GO: "MUSHY PEAS,

16:12.008 --> 16:14.242
FIGGY PUDDING, AND ALL THAT

16:14.311 --> 16:16.811
MILK," AND, I WOULD BE WRECKED.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.513
AND, SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE

16:18.582 --> 16:21.682
NUMBERS: THE MEDIAN COMPENSATED

16:21.751 --> 16:22.884
EMPLOYEE FOR DOLLAR GENERAL

16:22.953 --> 16:24.786
MAKES ABOUT $18,000 A YEAR.

16:24.855 --> 16:25.753
AND, A REPORT TWO YEARS AGO

16:25.822 --> 16:27.555
FOUND THAT 92% OF DOLLAR

16:27.624 --> 16:31.392
GENERAL'S STAFF WAS MAKING LESS

16:31.461 --> 16:35.196
THAN $15 AN HOUR.

16:35.265 --> 16:35.830
THAT'S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN

16:35.899 --> 16:37.064
EVERY OTHER COMPANY THEY

16:37.133 --> 16:38.299
SURVEYED.

16:38.368 --> 16:40.368
ON TOP OF THAT, LAWSUITS AND

16:40.437 --> 16:41.169
PRESS REPORTS HAVE REPEATEDLY

16:41.238 --> 16:41.704
DOCUMENTED DOLLAR GENERAL

16:41.771 --> 16:43.704
SEVERELY RESTRICTING THE TOTAL

16:43.773 --> 16:44.338
HOURS IT ALLOCATES IN A WEEK TO

16:44.407 --> 16:45.840
NON-MANAGERS, AND THEN EXPECTING

16:45.909 --> 16:47.175
STORE MANAGERS, WHO ARE

16:47.244 --> 16:47.875
SALARIED, TO COVER THE REST

16:47.944 --> 16:50.645
WITHOUT OVERTIME.

16:50.714 --> 16:51.546
AND, WITHOUT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO

16:51.615 --> 16:53.014
EVERYTHING -- FROM RUNNING THE

16:53.083 --> 16:53.583
REGISTER, TO RECEIVING TRUCK

16:53.650 --> 16:55.216
DELIVERIES, TO STOCKING THE

16:55.285 --> 16:56.350
SHELVES, TO KEEPING PRICES

16:56.419 --> 16:58.453
UPDATED, AND CLEANING THE

16:58.522 --> 16:59.720
BATHROOMS -- THINGS CAN QUICKLY

16:59.789 --> 17:00.822
FALL APART.

17:00.891 --> 17:01.956
JUST WATCH AS THIS ASSISTANT

17:02.025 --> 17:05.760
MANAGER SENDS UP WHAT'S

17:05.829 --> 17:07.795
BASICALLY AN SOS TO THE COMPANY.

17:07.864 --> 17:08.496
>> OKAY, THIS IS A VIDEO FOR

17:08.565 --> 17:10.665
HELP TO ANYONE INSIDE THIS

17:10.734 --> 17:11.866
COMPANY THAT ACTUALLY CARES.

17:11.935 --> 17:13.067
WE ARE OVERLOADED WITH FREIGHT,

17:13.136 --> 17:14.635
AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOURS

17:14.704 --> 17:15.636
IN THE WEEK OR PEOPLE IN THE

17:15.705 --> 17:18.206
WEEK TO PUT THEM AWAY.

17:18.275 --> 17:19.807
WE ARE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED.

17:19.876 --> 17:26.876
THE BACK ROOM IS LIKE THIS.

17:31.855 --> 17:32.687
I CAN'T EVEN GET TO THE COOLER,

17:32.756 --> 17:33.287
AND I'VE GOT A MILK DELIVERY

17:33.356 --> 17:34.021
OUTSIDE.

17:34.090 --> 17:35.223
SO, HOPEFULLY IT ALL GOES OUT ON

17:35.292 --> 17:36.224
THE SALES FLOOR.

17:36.293 --> 17:37.859
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.

17:37.928 --> 17:38.493
AGAIN, THIS VIDEO IS FOR ANYBODY

17:38.562 --> 17:39.894
IN THE COMPANY THAT CARES.

17:39.963 --> 17:40.230
THIS IS TRAVIS

17:40.297 --> 17:41.162
BENNETT, THE ASSISTANT MANAGER

17:41.231 --> 17:42.430
AT STORE 11320.

17:42.499 --> 17:43.064
>> John: WOW, IT IS NOT GOOD IF

17:43.133 --> 17:44.665
YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING

17:44.734 --> 17:45.366
TIKTOKS THAT LOOK LIKE HOSTAGE

17:45.435 --> 17:46.968
VIDEOS.

17:47.037 --> 17:47.602
BECAUSE, THAT'S NOT WHAT TIKTOK

17:47.671 --> 17:48.469
IS FOR.

17:48.538 --> 17:49.537
AS WE ALL KNOW, IT'S FOR FINDING

17:49.606 --> 17:50.438
OUT WHICH ANIME CHARACTER

17:50.507 --> 17:51.205
STRANGERS WOULD PORK, AND SEEING

17:51.274 --> 17:53.074
WHAT YOU'D LOOK LIKE POSITIVELY

17:53.143 --> 17:55.076
SNATCHED.

17:55.145 --> 17:56.844
BUT, THE PROBLEM WITH ADDRESSING

17:56.913 --> 17:58.446
THAT TO "ANYBODY IN THE COMPANY

17:58.515 --> 18:01.516
THAT CARES" IS THAT IT SURE

18:01.585 --> 18:03.151
SEEMS LIKE THESE COMPANIES DO

18:03.220 --> 18:04.452
NOT CARE, AT ALL.

18:04.521 --> 18:05.386
IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE

18:05.455 --> 18:06.354
INDIFFERENCE THESE CHAINS CAN

18:06.423 --> 18:08.689
SHOW TO THEIR EMPLOYEES' WORKING

18:08.758 --> 18:09.690
CONDITIONS -- AND NOT JUST IN

18:09.759 --> 18:11.192
THEIR STORES, BUT IN SOME OF

18:11.261 --> 18:12.960
THEIR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, TOO.

18:13.029 --> 18:13.661
>> YOU MAY REMEMBER US SHOWING

18:13.730 --> 18:17.632
YOU VIDEO OF RATS INSIDE THE

18:17.701 --> 18:18.299
FAMILY DOLLAR STORE IN WHITE

18:18.368 --> 18:22.270
HAVEN AND THE COMPANY'S

18:22.339 --> 18:23.070
DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN WEST

18:23.139 --> 18:24.338
MEMPHIS, ARKANSAS.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.873
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.

18:25.942 --> 18:27.008
RIGHT NOW, FEDERAL INSPECTORS

18:27.077 --> 18:28.142
SAY THEY HAVE FOUND MORE THAN

18:28.211 --> 18:28.910
1,000 RODENTS INSIDE THE SAME

18:28.979 --> 18:32.447
DISTRIBUTION CENTER.

18:32.516 --> 18:32.615
OH!

18:32.682 --> 18:34.115
MY GOODNESS!

18:34.184 --> 18:35.883
>> John: OKAY, SET ASIDE THE

18:35.952 --> 18:37.418
1,000 RODENTS --WHICH, I KNOW,

18:37.487 --> 18:41.322
IS ALREADY A BIG ASK -- I JUST

18:41.391 --> 18:41.825
WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO

18:41.892 --> 18:45.960
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS LITTLE DIVA.

18:46.029 --> 18:47.061
LOOK AT HER, NOT GIVING TWO

18:47.130 --> 18:47.995
SHITS ABOUT BEING FED A PRINGLE.

18:48.064 --> 18:48.796
OTHER RATS WOULD POUNCE AT THE

18:48.865 --> 18:49.564
SIGHT OF THAT CHIP, BUT NOT HER.

18:49.633 --> 18:50.133
SHE'S GIVING IT A BLANK LOOK

18:50.200 --> 18:51.132
THAT SAYS, "HONEY, NOT EVEN AT

18:51.201 --> 18:52.767
MY LOWEST."

18:52.836 --> 18:54.936
SHE'S GOT STANDARDS, SHE'S GOT

18:55.005 --> 18:56.637
TASTE, SHE'S "RATATOUILLE 2:

18:56.706 --> 18:59.140
ABSOLUTE FOOD BITCH."

18:59.209 --> 19:02.443
BUT, THAT FDA INSPECTION NOT

19:02.512 --> 19:04.679
ONLY FOUND THAT MORE THAN 1,000

19:04.748 --> 19:06.514
DEAD RODENTS HAD BEEN RECOVERED

19:06.583 --> 19:07.648
AT THAT DISTRIBUTION CENTER LAST

19:07.717 --> 19:09.050
YEAR, BUT ALSO THAT THE

19:09.119 --> 19:10.651
COMPANY'S OWN RECORDS SHOWED IT

19:10.720 --> 19:11.819
HAD COLLECTED MORE THAN 2,300

19:11.888 --> 19:12.687
RODENTS THERE THE SPRING AND

19:12.756 --> 19:14.088
SUMMER BEFORE, DEMONSTRATING,

19:14.157 --> 19:14.657
AND I QUOTE, "A HISTORY OF

19:14.724 --> 19:18.326
INFESTATION."

19:18.395 --> 19:19.560
BUT, AT THAT POINT, IT'S LESS AN

19:19.629 --> 19:20.595
INFESTATION AND MORE A

19:20.664 --> 19:21.929
FLOURISHING COMMUNITY OF RATS.

19:21.998 --> 19:24.999
ESTABLISHING AN INTERNAL ORDER.

19:25.068 --> 19:26.400
BUILDING OUT THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

19:26.469 --> 19:29.403
PROBABLY EXPLORING THE ARTS.

19:29.472 --> 19:30.037
THIS WAS BOTH A MASSIVE PROBLEM

19:30.106 --> 19:32.807
FOR FAMILY DOLLAR AND A

19:32.876 --> 19:34.308
GENUINELY INSPIRING STORY OF

19:34.377 --> 19:35.443
RODENT FORTITUDE.

19:35.512 --> 19:36.043
NOW: THE COMPANY WANTS YOU TO

19:36.112 --> 19:37.245
KNOW: THEY'VE SINCE SHUT DOWN

19:37.314 --> 19:37.912
THAT DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND ARE

19:37.981 --> 19:40.615
THOROUGHLY REMODELING IT.

19:40.684 --> 19:41.949
BUT, THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE IN

19:42.018 --> 19:43.251
A HORRIFYING PATTERN FOR DOLLAR

19:43.320 --> 19:43.985
STORES.

19:44.054 --> 19:44.819
DOLLAR GENERAL HAS ALSO HAD TO

19:44.888 --> 19:47.488
TEMPORARILY CLOSE MULTIPLE

19:47.557 --> 19:49.157
STORES AND A DISTRIBUTION CENTER

19:49.226 --> 19:51.492
FOR RAT INFESTATIONS, AND AT ONE

19:51.561 --> 19:52.426
STORE IN OKLAHOMA, BIRDS NESTED

19:52.495 --> 19:53.661
IN THE CEILING AND -- I'M SO

19:53.730 --> 19:55.263
SERIOUS -- STARTED SHITTING ALL

19:55.332 --> 19:59.000
OVER THE MERCHANDISE.

19:59.069 --> 19:59.901
NOT JUST THAT.

19:59.970 --> 20:03.037
WHEN THE STAFF TOLD HIGHER-UPS

20:03.106 --> 20:03.638
IN THE COMPANY, THEY SAY THEY

20:03.707 --> 20:04.972
WERE ORDERED "NOT TO THROW THE

20:05.041 --> 20:05.573
SOILED PRODUCTS OUT," BUT TO

20:05.642 --> 20:07.375
CLEAN THEM, IN SOME CASES BY

20:07.444 --> 20:08.676
BRINGING THEM HOME TO WASH, AND

20:08.745 --> 20:12.814
THEN RETURN THEM TO THE SHELVES.

20:12.883 --> 20:13.383
AND, WHEN THAT STORE MANAGER

20:13.450 --> 20:14.449
ASKED FOR HELP IN REMOVING THE

20:14.518 --> 20:15.082
NESTS, HE SAYS HE GOT THE SENSE

20:15.151 --> 20:16.851
HE WAS BEING IGNORED, BECAUSE

20:16.920 --> 20:17.420
"THE BIRDS WEREN'T STEALING

20:17.487 --> 20:18.653
ANYTHING."

20:18.722 --> 20:19.487
AND, LOOK: THERE ARE PLENTY OF

20:19.556 --> 20:22.056
REASONS TO KICK ANYONE OR

20:22.125 --> 20:23.257
ANYTHING OUT OF A STORE, EVEN IF

20:23.326 --> 20:28.729
THEY AREN'T "STEALING ANYTHING,"

20:28.798 --> 20:29.363
AND NUMBER ONE ON THAT LIST IS

20:29.432 --> 20:31.032
"THEY'RE POOPING EVERYWHERE."

20:31.101 --> 20:33.434
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A BIRD OR A

20:33.503 --> 20:34.769
TODDLER.

20:34.838 --> 20:35.369
THE SECOND SHIT IS PART OF THE

20:35.438 --> 20:37.071
EQUATION, THEY'VE GOT TO GO.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.372
NOW, LEGALLY, I DO HAVE TO TELL

20:38.441 --> 20:39.407
YOU: DOLLAR GENERAL WAS ASKED

20:39.476 --> 20:40.775
ABOUT THAT BIRD STORY, AND ITS

20:40.844 --> 20:44.812
RESPONSE WAS THAT IT TAKES

20:44.881 --> 20:47.048
PROMPT ACTION WHEN STORES MAKE

20:47.117 --> 20:47.682
MAINTENANCE OR REPAIR REQUESTS.

20:47.751 --> 20:48.416
WHICH, AS STATEMENTS GO, SOUNDS

20:48.485 --> 20:49.784
TO ME A LITTLE BIT LIKE --

20:49.853 --> 20:50.685
WHAT'S THE WORD?

20:50.754 --> 20:51.385
>> CACA.

20:51.454 --> 20:52.720
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

20:52.789 --> 20:53.754
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:53.823 --> 20:54.388
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "OKAY,

20:54.457 --> 20:55.923
I'M CONVINCED -- THESE STORES

20:55.992 --> 20:56.691
SOUND LIKE A TERRIBLE PLACE TO

20:56.760 --> 20:59.327
WORK," I'M NOT NEARLY DONE YET.

20:59.396 --> 20:59.927
SOME DOLLAR GENERAL EMPLOYEES

20:59.996 --> 21:01.696
HAVE SAID THEY'RE UNABLE TO

21:01.765 --> 21:02.864
CONTROL THE THERMOSTATS AT

21:02.933 --> 21:04.465
STORES, AND OTHERS SAY THEY

21:04.534 --> 21:05.099
DON'T HAVE FUNCTIONING HEAT AND

21:05.168 --> 21:09.537
COOLING SYSTEMS AT ALL.

21:09.606 --> 21:10.171
>> THE HEAT WOULD CAUSE ALL THE

21:10.240 --> 21:11.839
CANDY TO MELT, AND I DON'T KNOW

21:11.908 --> 21:12.473
IF IT WAS NEGATORY ON THE

21:12.542 --> 21:15.910
MEDICATIONS, BUT, I MEAN, I KNOW

21:15.979 --> 21:16.379
THEY GOTTA BE CLIMATE

21:16.446 --> 21:18.079
CONTROLLED.

21:18.148 --> 21:19.380
MY ASSISTANT MANAGER WAS SITTING

21:19.449 --> 21:20.014
IN THERE WITH ICE PACKS DOWN HER

21:20.083 --> 21:20.648
PANTS AND HER SHIRT AND A TOWEL,

21:20.717 --> 21:21.282
'CAUSE WE WERE JUST DRIPPING IN

21:21.351 --> 21:22.416
SWEAT.

21:22.485 --> 21:23.084
>> John: THAT'S NOT GREAT.

21:23.153 --> 21:24.685
AN ICE PACK DOWN THE PANTS IS

21:24.754 --> 21:25.887
NOT HOW YOU IMAGINE A DAY AT

21:25.956 --> 21:26.189
WORK GOING.

21:26.256 --> 21:27.889
IT IS, HOWEVER, HOW I IMAGINE

21:27.958 --> 21:30.491
THESE TWO FREAKS FUCK.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.393
AND, WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

21:32.462 --> 21:33.461
TOGETHER -- THE HEAT, THE

21:33.530 --> 21:36.664
UNDERSTAFFING, THE BOXES

21:36.733 --> 21:37.365
EVERYWHERE MEANING YOU CAN'T

21:37.434 --> 21:38.299
MOVE AROUND PROPERLY -- IT'S

21:38.368 --> 21:40.201
PRETTY CLEAR THESE PLACES AREN'T

21:40.270 --> 21:41.936
JUST UNPLEASANT: THEY'RE UNSAFE.

21:42.005 --> 21:43.337
DOLLAR GENERAL IS ON OSHA'S

21:43.406 --> 21:45.973
SEVERE VIOLATORS LIST, RACKING

21:46.042 --> 21:47.141
UP MORE THAN $25 MILLION IN

21:47.210 --> 21:48.576
PROPOSED FINES SINCE 2017 FOR

21:48.645 --> 21:49.310
ALLEGED VIOLATIONS SPANNING

21:49.379 --> 21:51.345
DOZENS OF STATES.

21:51.414 --> 21:52.013
AND, AS FOR DOLLAR TREE, IN THAT

21:52.082 --> 21:54.215
SAME TIME FRAME, OSHA'S

21:54.284 --> 21:55.550
IDENTIFIED MORE THAN 400

21:55.619 --> 21:57.218
VIOLATIONS AT ITS STORES,

21:57.287 --> 21:57.852
IMPOSING MORE THAN $13 MILLION

21:57.921 --> 22:04.921
IN FINES.

22:06.463 --> 22:07.261
NOW, I HAVE TO SAY: DOLLAR TREE

22:07.330 --> 22:08.596
RECENTLY ENTERED A SETTLEMENT

22:08.665 --> 22:09.197
WITH OSHA AND CLAIMS THAT IT'S

22:09.266 --> 22:10.231
"IMPLEMENTING SUBSTANTIAL SAFETY

22:10.300 --> 22:10.767
POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND

22:10.834 --> 22:11.566
TRAINING TO SAFEGUARD THE

22:11.635 --> 22:12.166
WELLBEING OF OUR ASSOCIATES."

22:12.235 --> 22:13.167
ALTHOUGH, YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW:

22:13.236 --> 22:16.404
THEY HAD A SIMILAR SETTLEMENT

22:16.473 --> 22:17.004
BACK IN 2015 AND MADE SIMILAR

22:17.073 --> 22:17.638
PROMISES BACK THEN, SO THEY'RE,

22:17.707 --> 22:18.539
AT BEST, A SLOW LEARNER.

22:18.608 --> 22:20.441
AND, THERE IS ONE LAST INDIGNITY

22:20.510 --> 22:23.044
FOR DOLLAR STORE EMPLOYEES, AND

22:23.113 --> 22:23.811
THAT IS THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE.

22:23.880 --> 22:24.479
DOLLAR STORES HAVE BECOME

22:24.548 --> 22:27.348
"MAGNETS FOR CRIME AND KILLING,"

22:27.417 --> 22:27.982
WITH EMPLOYEES AT DOLLAR GENERAL

22:28.051 --> 22:30.084
SAYING THEY'VE BEEN STABBED,

22:30.153 --> 22:32.286
SHOT, HELD AT GUNPOINT, PUNCHED

22:32.355 --> 22:33.988
AND PISTOL-WHIPPED ON THE JOB.

22:34.057 --> 22:35.656
AND, WHEN A ROBBERY DOES HAPPEN,

22:35.725 --> 22:36.524
THE RESPONSE FROM CORPORATE CAN

22:36.593 --> 22:38.759
BE LESS THAN COMPASSIONATE.

22:38.828 --> 22:39.627
REMEMBER THAT WORKER TALKING

22:39.696 --> 22:41.062
ABOUT HOW THE BOSSES WERE EATING

22:41.131 --> 22:42.663
FILET MIGNON?

22:42.732 --> 22:43.798
HERE SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE

22:43.867 --> 22:47.668
DAY HER STORE WAS ROBBED.

22:47.737 --> 22:48.503
>> I WAS ROBBED AT THE SAME

22:48.572 --> 22:50.104
DOLLAR GENERAL WHERE I CURRENTLY

22:50.173 --> 22:51.105
WORK.

22:51.174 --> 22:51.973
I PICKED UP MY PHONE AND CALLED

22:52.042 --> 22:53.875
911.

22:53.944 --> 22:54.709
I LOCKED THE DOOR, I SECURED THE

22:54.778 --> 23:00.047
CUSTOMERS, I FOLLOWED PROTOCOL.

23:00.116 --> 23:00.648
CALLED OUR MANAGER, SHE SHOWED

23:00.717 --> 23:04.719
UP.

23:04.788 --> 23:05.319
I CALLED OUR DISTRICT MANAGER

23:05.388 --> 23:07.288
LIKE TWO TO THREE TIMES.

23:07.357 --> 23:08.956
SHE DIDN'T ANSWER.

23:09.025 --> 23:09.590
BUT, WHEN MY MANAGER CALLED, SHE

23:09.659 --> 23:10.958
ANSWERED.

23:11.027 --> 23:11.893
THE FIRST QUESTION WAS, "IS

23:11.962 --> 23:13.427
EVERYBODY OKAY?"

23:13.496 --> 23:14.061
THE SECOND THING SHE SAID, "WHAT

23:14.130 --> 23:16.497
ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT

23:16.566 --> 23:19.433
REOPENING THE STORE?"

23:19.502 --> 23:21.402
WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ROBBED EVEN

23:21.471 --> 23:24.205
DOGGONE 10 TO 15 MINUTES AND

23:24.274 --> 23:25.840
YOU'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT

23:25.909 --> 23:27.775
OPENING UP THE STORE!?

23:27.844 --> 23:28.843
>> John: THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

23:28.912 --> 23:29.844
AN ARMED ROBBERY IS A TRAUMATIC

23:29.913 --> 23:30.678
EVENT PEOPLE NEED TIME TO

23:30.747 --> 23:32.647
RECOVER FROM.

23:32.716 --> 23:33.281
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST

23:33.350 --> 23:35.149
IGNORE, LIKE A SPAM CALL, OR A

23:35.218 --> 23:36.150
BROKEN LIGHTBULB, OR ANY SHOW ON

23:36.219 --> 23:40.988
APPLE TV.

23:41.057 --> 23:41.656
DID YOU KNOW OCTAVIA SPENCER

23:41.725 --> 23:42.757
STARRED AS A TRUE CRIME

23:42.826 --> 23:44.358
PODCASTER ON A SHOW CALLED

23:44.427 --> 23:45.460
"TRUTH BE TOLD" FOR THREE YEARS?

23:45.529 --> 23:46.327
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T!

23:46.396 --> 23:47.862
IT'S APPLE TV: WHERE CELEBRITIES

23:47.931 --> 23:50.031
GO TO HIDE.

23:50.100 --> 23:53.301
WHILE RESEARCHING THIS PIECE,

23:53.370 --> 23:54.869
DOLLAR STORE WORKERS REPEATEDLY

23:54.938 --> 23:56.471
TOLD US HOW THEY FEARED FOR

23:56.540 --> 23:56.806
THEIR SAFETY.

23:56.873 --> 23:58.339
AND, WHILE THESE COMPANIES SAY

23:58.408 --> 24:00.908
THEY TAKE SECURITY CONCERNS

24:00.977 --> 24:02.577
SERIOUSLY, EXPERTS HAVE SAID THE

24:02.646 --> 24:03.578
LEVEL OF VIOLENCE MAY BE DOWN TO

24:03.647 --> 24:04.812
HOW THESE STORES ARE SET UP AND

24:04.881 --> 24:06.814
ORGANIZED.

24:06.883 --> 24:07.715
HAVING SO FEW PEOPLE WORKING

24:07.784 --> 24:08.783
THERE, WITH NO SECURITY GUARD

24:08.852 --> 24:09.650
TYPICALLY PRESENT, MAKES THEM AN

24:09.719 --> 24:10.818
INCREDIBLY ENTICING TARGET.

24:10.887 --> 24:12.186
IN TEXAS, A DOLLAR GENERAL

24:12.255 --> 24:13.888
EMPLOYEE -- WHO HAD A COWORKER

24:13.957 --> 24:16.190
DIE IN HER ARMS -- CLAIMED IN A

24:16.259 --> 24:16.791
LAWSUIT THAT HER STORE HAD NO

24:16.860 --> 24:17.925
LIGHTS AT THE BACK OF THE

24:17.994 --> 24:19.794
BUILDING, AND CASH REGISTERS

24:19.863 --> 24:21.295
THAT DIDN'T HAVE PANIC BUTTONS,

24:21.364 --> 24:22.530
AND THAT THE SIGN ANNOUNCING A

24:22.599 --> 24:23.531
REMOTELY MONITORED SECURITY

24:23.600 --> 24:24.765
SYSTEM WAS A SHAM.

24:24.834 --> 24:26.701
AT THAT POINT, THEY MIGHT AS

24:26.770 --> 24:28.169
WELL PUT UP ONE OF THOSE FLOPPY

24:28.238 --> 24:29.670
MEN HOLDING A "PLUNDER ME, BABE"

24:29.739 --> 24:31.739
SIGN.

24:31.808 --> 24:32.540
AT ALMOST EVERY TURN, DOLLAR

24:32.609 --> 24:34.108
STORES SEEM TO TREAT THEIR

24:34.177 --> 24:35.676
WORKERS WITH EITHER STUNNING

24:35.745 --> 24:37.011
INDIFFERENCE OR OUTRIGHT

24:37.080 --> 24:38.780
CONTEMPT.

24:38.849 --> 24:41.415
AND, SOME ARE SO FED UP, THEY'RE

24:41.484 --> 24:42.383
WALKING OUT, LEADING TO STORIES

24:42.452 --> 24:43.751
LIKE THIS.

24:43.820 --> 24:44.385
>> WE SAW DOZENS OF PEOPLE

24:44.454 --> 24:49.323
TRYING TO GO INSIDE FAMILY

24:49.392 --> 24:50.291
DOLLAR THIS AFTERNOON, ONLY TO

24:50.360 --> 24:51.225
FIND THE DOORS LOCKED AND NO ONE

24:51.294 --> 24:52.426
INSIDE.

24:52.495 --> 24:53.995
GARFIELD RESIDENT DODI BYRNE

24:54.064 --> 24:55.363
WENT TO FAMILY DOLLAR ON TED

24:55.432 --> 24:56.864
AVENUE YESTERDAY, ONLY TO FIND

24:56.933 --> 24:57.465
THIS SIGN READING "STAFF QUIT,

24:57.534 --> 24:59.100
Y'ALL BE EASY" ON THE DOOR.

24:59.169 --> 25:01.068
>> John: YEAH, AND NONE OF THAT

25:01.137 --> 25:03.337
IS AT ALL UNCOMMON.

25:03.406 --> 25:04.872
AT ANOTHER FAMILY DOLLAR IN

25:04.941 --> 25:05.940
NEBRASKA, STAFF LEFT THIS SIGN

25:06.009 --> 25:06.974
ON THE DOOR: "WE ALL QUIT!

25:07.043 --> 25:09.377
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE."

25:09.446 --> 25:10.077
AND, AT A DOLLAR GENERAL IN

25:10.146 --> 25:10.845
MAINE, WORKERS LEFT A SERIES OF

25:10.914 --> 25:12.280
SIGNS READING: "CLOSED

25:12.349 --> 25:13.748
INDEFINITELY BECAUSE DOLLAR

25:13.817 --> 25:15.450
GENERAL DOESN'T PAY A LIVING

25:15.519 --> 25:16.050
WAGE OR TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES

25:16.119 --> 25:17.485
WITH RESPECT," AND "CAPITALISM

25:17.554 --> 25:19.253
WILL DESTROY THIS COUNTRY.

25:19.322 --> 25:19.854
IF YOU DON'T PAY PEOPLE ENOUGH

25:19.923 --> 25:20.955
TO LIVE THEIR LIVES, WHY SHOULD

25:21.024 --> 25:21.756
THEY SLAVE AWAY FOR YOU?"

25:21.825 --> 25:23.724
ALL OF WHICH IS PUNCTUATED

25:23.793 --> 25:26.794
PERFECTLY BY THE EXCITED "NOW

25:26.863 --> 25:29.363
HIRING SIGN," WHICH "REALLY" HAS

25:29.432 --> 25:33.401
ITS WORK CUT OUT FOR IT.

25:33.470 --> 25:35.870
AND, WHILE THOSE WORKERS ARE

25:35.939 --> 25:36.838
JUSTIFIABLY WALKING OUT, OTHERS

25:36.907 --> 25:39.474
ARE CHOOSING TO FIGHT BACK.

25:39.543 --> 25:40.875
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, GROUPS

25:40.944 --> 25:41.509
LIKE "STEP UP LOUISIANA" AND THE

25:41.578 --> 25:42.443
UNION OF SOUTHERN SERVICE

25:42.512 --> 25:48.282
WORKERS HAVE STAGED STRIKES AND

25:48.351 --> 25:50.518
PROTESTS AGAINST DOLLAR GENERAL.

25:50.587 --> 25:51.152
BUT, THE COMPANY HAS PUSHED BACK

25:51.221 --> 25:52.353
HARD, IN ALL THE USUAL

25:52.422 --> 25:53.421
UNION-BUSTING WAYS.

25:53.490 --> 25:54.222
IN CONNECTICUT, WHEN WORKERS

25:54.291 --> 25:55.490
TRIED TO ORGANIZE, DOLLAR

25:55.559 --> 25:56.257
GENERAL VIOLATED FEDERAL LAW BY

25:56.326 --> 25:57.492
FIRING A PRO-UNION WORKER,

25:57.561 --> 25:58.693
ILLEGALLY SURVEILLING AND

25:58.762 --> 26:00.027
INTERROGATING EMPLOYEES, AND

26:00.096 --> 26:01.596
THREATENING TO CLOSE THE STORE.

26:01.665 --> 26:03.097
THEY ALSO MAKE ALL NEW EMPLOYEES

26:03.166 --> 26:03.798
WATCH A VIDEO WHERE THEY

26:03.867 --> 26:04.966
SHIT-TALK THE VERY IDEA OF

26:05.035 --> 26:06.467
JOINING A UNION, WHICH ONE

THEM.

26:17.080 --> 26:17.912
OUR EMPLOYEES DON'T NEED A UNION

26:19.249 --> 26:20.748
AT DOLLAR GENERAL.

VOICES HEARD?

26:28.325 --> 26:29.957
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

26:30.026 --> 26:30.591
SEEMS LIKE THE GUY PLEADING FOR

26:30.660 --> 26:32.026
AID FROM TIKTOK STRANGERS MIGHT

26:32.095 --> 26:32.860
BEG TO DIFFER.

26:32.929 --> 26:34.495
SO, WHAT IS THERE TO DO?

26:34.564 --> 26:35.797
WELL, SINCE 2019, AT LEAST 75

26:35.866 --> 26:36.764

26:36.833 --> 26:37.899

26:37.968 --> 26:39.667
BLOCKED PROPOSALS TO BUILD NEW

26:39.736 --> 26:40.868
DOLLAR STORES.

26:40.937 --> 26:41.869
BUT, THE TRUTH IS, MOST OF THESE

26:41.938 --> 26:44.372
STORES ARE UNLIKELY TO GO

26:44.441 --> 26:45.139
ANYWHERE: REMEMBER, IN MANY

26:45.208 --> 26:46.374
AREAS, THEY'RE THE ONLY RETAILER

26:46.443 --> 26:47.909
AROUND.

26:47.978 --> 26:49.177
SO, MUCH MORE ATTENTION NEEDS TO

26:49.246 --> 26:50.645
BE PAID TO WHAT WORKERS HAVE

26:50.714 --> 26:53.414
BEEN SAYING, AND FOR YEARS NOW.

26:53.483 --> 26:54.048
DOLLAR STORE WORKERS AT "STEP UP

33:47.731 --> 33:48.463

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:57.641 --> 33:59.841
IN A VARIETY OF DELIGHTFUL WAYS.

33:59.910 --> 34:00.376
THE TEAM BEHIND THE TAKAHE

34:00.443 --> 34:02.410
POSTED THIS "ANCHORMAN" MEME OF

34:02.479 --> 34:04.479
THEIR BIRD SAYING, "WELL, THAT

34:04.548 --> 34:06.180
WAS UNEXPECTED."

34:06.249 --> 34:07.815
WHICH ISN'T QUITE RIGHT.

34:07.884 --> 34:08.616
THE LINE FROM THE MOVIE IS,

34:08.685 --> 34:10.017
"BOY, THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY."

34:10.086 --> 34:11.519
AND, FRANKLY, IT'S THAT KIND OF

34:11.588 --> 34:12.420
LACK OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL THAT

34:12.489 --> 34:14.489
MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE TAKAHE

34:14.558 --> 34:16.691
LOST THIS CONTEST SO BADLY.

34:16.760 --> 34:17.859
MEANWHILE, CAMPAIGNERS FOR THE

34:17.928 --> 34:19.560
KAKI POSTED THIS VIDEO OF THEIR

ME, AND THEN PECKING AT IT ON
