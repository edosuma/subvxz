01:30.006 --> 01:34.134
Tell you what...
Read the dosage on the package.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.097
Yes, they go by size.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.643
Get a tablet
and hide it in her kibble.

01:46.481 --> 01:50.109
I think half should be enough,
but...

01:50.235 --> 01:53.612
look at the dosage...
Stop it!

01:53.988 --> 01:56.740
No, sorry, I didn't mean you.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.368
I was talking to my dog.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.662
I have a Labrador, yes.

02:03.039 --> 02:05.874
Get down! Yes, yes...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.168
Yes, they're very affectionate dogs.

02:08.544 --> 02:11.505
With children,
but particularly with adults.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.174
- Where are you going?
- I told you, to Chicca's.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.553
- I don't believe you.
- Don't then.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.930
You're seeing Gregorio.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.557
No!

02:24.519 --> 02:28.063
By telling lies, you're hurting
yourself more than me.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.942
What a pain! Chicca
and I are meeting the others.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.695
- Gregorio might be there.
- Why do you need these?

02:35.029 --> 02:38.157
- They're not mine.
- They were in your bag.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.034
- I'm holding them for Chicca.
- Think I'm stupid?

02:42.078 --> 02:44.454
And stop rummaging through my bag.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.082
God! You drive me crazy!

02:47.208 --> 02:49.585
I know the feeling!

02:53.464 --> 02:57.176
Rosa, it's late, time for bed.
Come with mommy.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.554
- Say night-night to grandma.
- Night-night.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.099
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bruno, I want you in bed by ten.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.186
- Hear that? Ten o'clock.
- And no fuss.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.105
He doesn't make a fuss with grandma.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.233
- Because you spoil him.
- That's not true!

03:13.484 --> 03:15.235
Forget it.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.995
I've stopped taking the pill.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.749
- I'm glad.
- Really?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.001
Yes.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.009
Your daughter spews lies.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.641
- You've got nothing to say?
- Well, she's 17...

03:45.767 --> 03:48.227
- It's normal.
- She's going out with Gregorio.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.648
- So? They're an item.
- I don't like him.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.777
- She does.
- Rocco, you don't like him either.

03:56.903 --> 04:01.531
No, I don't like him either.
But it's pointless trying to stop her.

04:02.033 --> 04:06.787
Your parents didn't like you dating me,
but it made no difference.

04:07.038 --> 04:11.667
How many teens have you treated,
Eva? Some still thank you.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.796
- Try to be a bit more detached.
- She's my daughter.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.132
- I can't be detached.
- You're always criticizing her.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.677
She criticizes me!

04:40.154 --> 04:42.072
- I'll take that.
- Thanks.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.704
- Wait, I forgot my phone.
- Hurry, it's late!

05:10.601 --> 05:13.353
She's got condoms in her bag.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.859
- How do you know?
- I found them.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.236
- You searched her bag?
- I was looking for something.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.113
Eva!

05:24.365 --> 05:27.242
Sofia's going through the drama
of leaving the family unit.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.246
Then let's allow her to
without being pains.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.876
It would be wrong, she needs
a conflict to define herself,

05:36.002 --> 05:38.211
a model to detach herselffrom,
understand?

05:39.756 --> 05:42.132
Eva, my mother was a green...

05:42.342 --> 05:44.259
- Oh God!
- A greengrocer.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.346
You can't imagine
how much simpler it was.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.766
I left the family unit
without my parents even noticing.

05:50.892 --> 05:55.020
My mom would ask: "Where's Rocco?"
"Dunno, has he gone out?"

05:57.357 --> 06:02.277
PERFECT STRANGERS

06:06.908 --> 06:09.910
- Lovely moon. What time's the eclipse?
- Dunno.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.039
Why did we call Bruno Bruno?

06:14.665 --> 06:18.251
- Huh?
- My father's Amedeo, yours is Ennio.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.922
What were we thinking calling him
"Bruno"? Do you like it?

06:22.173 --> 06:25.175
So now we're having doubts
10 years later?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.302
No...

06:29.055 --> 06:32.391
- And don't talk back to mom like that.
- Like what?

06:32.683 --> 06:34.893
Like you did.

06:45.696 --> 06:49.950
- It's biodynamic, will it be okay?
- For 25 euros it'd better be!

06:51.953 --> 06:55.831
- Pull over and we'll get another.
- Bianca...

06:55.957 --> 06:59.418
- It's a dinner, not a wine tasting.
- But Eva's a nitpicker.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.962
I'm not in the mood to hear her.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.424
Then we'll say I bought it,
so she can pick on me.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.845
- What are you doing?
- Taking the price off.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.223
Are you crazy? 25 euros.
Stick it on the cork!

07:18.855 --> 07:20.230
I'll get it.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.360
- Hello.
- How are things?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.988
- Has Peppe arrived yet?
- Not yet.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.367
I made a tiramisu.
Cosimo and Bianca are on their way up.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.454
- Okay. Ricotta or mascarpone?
- Mascarpone.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.748
Let's see if you have the guts
to say yours is better.

07:38.875 --> 07:39.958
Come in.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.501
Hi!

07:42.879 --> 07:45.964
- I made a tiramisu. Sofia?
- In her bedroom.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.092
- I'll go and say hello.
- No, leave her be.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.094
- You're at war?
- Guerrilla warfare.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.013
What happened?

07:54.765 --> 07:57.392
I found condoms in her bag.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.144
No!

07:59.353 --> 08:02.898
- God, what if Rosa does that?
- Rosa's not even 6!

08:03.900 --> 08:07.777
- Hello?
- Come in. Hi, Bianca!

08:08.154 --> 08:11.031
- Hi.
- Hi, everyone. Where's Peppe?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.116
He's not here yet.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.285
- White.
- It's biodynamic.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.370
You fell that hoax...

08:17.497 --> 08:20.916
- Why just one bottle?
- It's biodynamic.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.169
- What does that mean?
- It means 25 euros.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.131
Shall we pay him back?
In installments.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.301
- How do you picture this broad?
- "This broad" is Lucilla.

08:31.427 --> 08:36.264
- And don't start.
- She must be pretty to be with Peppe.

08:36.432 --> 08:40.018
She mustn't be very pretty
to be with Peppe.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.063
- Why not?
- Women like men like Peppe.

08:43.188 --> 08:47.025
- He's a wonderful man.
- He's easy to fall in love with.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.946
Yes, he's reassuring,
protective, gentle...

08:51.072 --> 08:53.073
- Yes.
- What a bore!

08:53.199 --> 08:57.827
"He's easy to fall in love with"?
Watch what you say, blondie.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.539
What if she's old?

09:01.958 --> 09:05.043
- Like a MILF!
- Eva and I are MILF age.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.213
- Speak for yourself, darling.
- I mean a real old lady.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.091
With a perm, a handbag...
how do we react?

09:11.217 --> 09:16.346
- She's got to be better than Emanuela.
- Don't even mention her name!

09:16.472 --> 09:20.225
- Who's Emanuela?
- Peppe's ex-wife.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.978
- She was anything but pretty.
- No.

09:23.604 --> 09:27.857
Now that it's all over
I gotta say that hoarse voice of hers

09:28.067 --> 09:30.485
turned me on a bit.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.239
It was before...

09:34.448 --> 09:37.576
You're saying it was after?
I wouldn't be so sure.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.120
- But she was strange.
- Yes.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.623
It's not bad, this bio...

09:45.501 --> 09:47.002
They're here!

09:57.388 --> 10:00.640
Good evening, everyone.
Hi, guys.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.520
- What's up?
- Where's Lucilla?

10:05.896 --> 10:07.522
She has a fever.

10:08.024 --> 10:11.985
- So she's not coming?
- No, she has a fever.

10:12.236 --> 10:16.156
- We really wanted to meet her.
- I know, she's disappointed too.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.286
- Do you want me to go?
- No!

10:21.871 --> 10:25.123
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.171
- She's ditched you already.
- Don't start that.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.256
- Did you two fight?
- No.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.426
- How old did you say she was?
- I didn't say.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.304
- But she's our age.
- Ouch!

10:39.513 --> 10:42.015
- What?
- She's old then.

10:42.183 --> 10:46.394
- It's a mature relationship.
- We said no jokes about Lucilla.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.314
- No, it's for Peppe.
- Thanks.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.316
- But Lucilla's not here.
- Right.

10:51.567 --> 10:55.528
But I am.
And you were saying... what?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.530
- The usual things.
- Such as?

10:57.907 --> 11:01.660
Just... we don't know her,
so we were trying to guess.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.037
Will she be tall, short...

11:04.163 --> 11:08.166
The usual, no...
Is she a redhead, brunette...

11:08.334 --> 11:11.336
- Blond.
- We even thought she might be gray.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.463
- Gray?
- Yes.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.090
Leave him alone!

11:15.466 --> 11:18.301
- Come on, the eclipse has started.
- Let's go!

11:18.928 --> 11:20.970
- I can see two.
- There are two.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.599
- I can see two because I can't see.
- Use this to focus it...

11:24.975 --> 11:27.686
Now I can see it! It's lovely.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.481
Lucilla's a nice name.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.359
- Peppe and Lucilla. Sounds good.
- Yes.

11:34.568 --> 11:38.113
About Lucilla, why don't you
tell us something about her?

11:38.239 --> 11:40.615
- What do you want to know?
- Are you in love?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.368
How do I know...

11:43.744 --> 11:47.247
Eva, how do you know
if you're in love?

11:47.373 --> 11:50.250
- Why are you asking me?
- You study these things.

11:50.751 --> 11:54.754
I'll tell you. If you talk to her
for 30 minutes a day, you're in love.

11:55.089 --> 11:59.134
- What if I talk for 60 minutes?
- Then you're madly in love.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.137
Then you stop talking,
which means you're married.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.516
- How long have you been together?
- Awhile, a few months.

12:06.642 --> 12:10.478
Great! The first sparks.
Are you ablaze?

12:11.105 --> 12:12.522
- Are you?
- I'm ablaze.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.399
- He's ablaze.
- I'm ablaze.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.527
Why did you choose tonight
to introduce us?

12:17.737 --> 12:20.530
I didn't choose, it just happened.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.992
Do you remember the evening
I met you all?

12:25.536 --> 12:28.288
- I was so anxious!
- Why?

12:28.414 --> 12:32.667
- She was so tense, poor girl.
- Meeting Cosimo's friends!

12:32.793 --> 12:35.670
All for this sweet deal here...

12:36.046 --> 12:39.382
From that point of view,
Lucilla wasn't worried.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.551
- Lucky her.
- That's why she has a fever!

12:43.763 --> 12:46.514
- I changed outfits 10 times that day.
- 20.

12:46.807 --> 12:52.187
But apparently it went well,
I feel like one of the gang now.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.190
- Who, you?
- One of the gang?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.442
No way!

12:59.195 --> 13:02.530
Darling, look at their faces.
They're teasing.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.658
- They're teasing.
- Of course we are.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.454
- You're our favorite.
- Cosimo, you got lucky.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.332
It wasn't luck.
Hands off, surgeon.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.459
- Leave me alone!
- Hands off.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.711
How many do you see?

13:18.422 --> 13:19.464
Two.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.468
- This sauce is good. What is it?
- Capers and olives.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.554
This summer we'll bring a ton of capers
back from the seaside.

13:27.598 --> 13:31.226
Here they charge 7.50 euros
for a jar this size.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.814
Damn! I should grow capers
on my land in hills.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.234
- Capers in the hills?
- Yeah, 7.50 euros!

13:39.485 --> 13:42.821
Please, you're not growing
capers now!

13:43.113 --> 13:45.365
Laugh all you want,
it's a good business.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.243
- Any news on the house in Salina?
- Not yet.

13:48.452 --> 13:53.456
- First trip without Chiara and Diego.
- I spoke to her, she says hello.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.876
- How is she?
- Miserable, back with her parents.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.505
Her husband's having an affair
with a girl their daughter's age...

14:00.631 --> 14:04.759
- It'll take time to get over it.
- She's nearing menopause, almost 50.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.221
- She'll never get over it.
- I have lots of patients like her.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.515
See?

14:11.392 --> 14:14.269
- Did you know about it?
- About what?

14:14.603 --> 14:17.230
- About this girl?
- No.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.149
- Of course they knew!
- Of course.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.609
How could we know?

14:22.111 --> 14:26.614
- Why, do you tell if you know?
- If you're a friend, yes.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.784
You're saying if we'd known about it

14:30.369 --> 14:34.873
we should've told Chiara her hubby
was screwing a 23-year-old hottie?

14:35.249 --> 14:37.917
- 23 years old?
- 22.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.628
- Almost 22.
- You're a bunch of shits.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.631
No, these are delicate issues.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.801
If all hell breaks loose,
they'll say it's your fault

14:47.177 --> 14:48.803
for poking your nose in.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.181
- Peppe's right.
- All right, but I'm warning you.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.435
If Cosimo cheats on me,
I want you to tell me.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.562
- If you really want to know...
- Idiot.

14:57.771 --> 15:01.691
- They'd never give each other away.
- They're all the same.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.444
- A losing battle.
- We're too different.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.946
Like a PC and a Mac.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.199
- And what are men?
- A PC, obviously.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.786
Cheap, they pick up viruses,
and only do one thing at a time.

15:13.954 --> 15:17.206
When Lele's in the shower,
he can either wash or sing.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.835
- Otherwise he freezes up.
- Very funny!

15:20.961 --> 15:22.962
Hilarious!

15:23.213 --> 15:27.717
And women are Macs.
Intuitive, fast, elegant.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.470
Expensive and compatible
only among themselves.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.348
Yes, but they're addictive too.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.186
- What will happen to Diego now?
- Nothing.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.731
- He's got no wife and kids.
- And a 22-year-old girlfriend.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.984
- A hellish life!
- Having to watch TV talent shows,

15:45.319 --> 15:48.446
going to Justin Bieber concerts,
getting drunk on beer...

15:48.572 --> 15:51.616
While your ex strips you
of everything: house, money, car...

15:51.742 --> 15:54.577
Don't exaggerate!

15:54.745 --> 15:56.621
- Everything!
- Just ask Peppe.

15:56.747 --> 16:01.626
I'm no example, my wife
nearly had to pay me alimony.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.965
A lawyer, however despicable,
knows how much a P.E. teacher earns.

16:07.466 --> 16:12.512
Nasty business though! A family
breaking up because of a text.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.765
- A 22-year-old slut, you mean.
- Almost 22.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.979
But if Chiara hadn't read that text...

16:21.397 --> 16:22.981
So it's her fault for reading it?

16:23.399 --> 16:27.402
No, but he could've at least
deleted the text...

16:27.528 --> 16:30.405
He was screwing a young girl,
he should've been careful.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.866
- What?
- Should've been careful about what?

16:34.034 --> 16:38.913
- About the text or being a shit?
- Don't take it out on me!

16:40.499 --> 16:43.793
Lele, pass me the eggplant patties.
It's hot!

16:44.420 --> 16:47.922
Cosimo's right,
you do have to be careful.

16:51.427 --> 16:56.889
We have everything in here.
It's the black box of our lives.

16:57.057 --> 17:01.519
How many couples would split up
if they looked at each other's phones?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.818
Lele would never let me see his.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.954
What's the problem?
Here, take it.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.832
- Oh I will.
- Go ahead.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.710
Lele, cut that out.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.588
- Look, his hand's trembling.
- He's turned pale.

17:28.797 --> 17:32.300
I insist you take it,
but put yours up here too.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.595
Sure, all you'll find are messages
from the pediatrician

17:35.721 --> 17:37.972
and your sister
asking about your mom.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.851
- Why does she ask you?
- Do you ever answer your phone?

17:41.977 --> 17:45.855
- Would you let Cosimo have yours?
- I don't even have a passcode.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.692
Darling, I wouldn't want yours.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.612
Rocco would rather swallow his,
wouldn't you, love?

17:52.738 --> 17:56.866
That's not true. Here.
You'll find a few tits and asses,

17:57.076 --> 17:59.118
but all tools of the trade.

18:00.621 --> 18:04.082
So you're saying
that none of us has a secret?

18:07.503 --> 18:11.005
- All saints, apart from Diego?
- Eva, what...

18:11.632 --> 18:15.468
- What secrets could we have?
- We know each other too well.

18:15.636 --> 18:19.764
Yes, let's hope there are some secrets
or what a bore!

18:19.973 --> 18:22.642
- Let's play a game then.
- What kind of game?

18:23.018 --> 18:26.020
- We'll find out.
- What?

18:29.024 --> 18:32.026
Come on, we'll all put
our phones on the table.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.906
- Then what?
- While we're eating,

18:37.032 --> 18:42.036
texts, WhatsApp messages, calls,
whatever arrives, we share it.

18:42.913 --> 18:46.415
- We don't have any secrets.
- What sort of game is that?

18:46.667 --> 18:49.043
- It might be fun.
- Think so?

18:49.419 --> 18:52.505
- Yes.
- Come on! Let's do it.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.133
- Do what?
- This is mine.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.928
- Of course, Lucilla's at home.
- I'd take part anyway.

18:59.054 --> 19:03.141
- Not even your mom calls you.
- What kind of game is this, Eva?

19:03.559 --> 19:06.769
- A fun game.
- I don't think so.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.564
Got something to hide?

19:09.690 --> 19:12.900
I'm worried that
you might have something to hide.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.027
I don't want to know
if you're cheating.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.947
If I were cheating,
I wouldn't have suggested this game.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.908
Or you are
and you want to be found out.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.579
There's this psychological mechanism
according to which...

19:24.705 --> 19:27.832
serial-killers do all they can
to get found out.

19:27.958 --> 19:31.085
Let's do. We can stop if we get bored.

19:31.211 --> 19:36.549
Yes, it's like when we played
truth or dare as kids.

19:36.717 --> 19:41.053
So what? We used to jerk off
together as kids too.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.932
- I didn't jerk off with you.
- No, you did it alone.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.477
- Cosimo, put your phone on the table.
- Huh?

19:48.604 --> 19:50.605
Get your phone out.

19:54.985 --> 19:59.071
- Should I be worried?
- No! Of course not!

19:59.948 --> 20:03.075
Here you go, it's not a problem.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.828
Are we really doing this?

20:05.954 --> 20:08.873
It's rude to keep phones
on the table while eating.

20:09.708 --> 20:14.503
- Yes, Diego always switched his off.
- Lele leaves his face down.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.759
- What?
- You leave it face down.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.094
Think I haven't noticed?

20:23.722 --> 20:26.974
It's not intentional.
I pull out my phone and place it down.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.102
If you scratch the screen
it costs 200 euros to replace it.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.022
- 50 in Chinatown.
- Let's scratch it then.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.527
Look here, look...
I'll put it face up.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.781
I'll get mine.
But I'm warning you...

20:41.990 --> 20:46.535
- If mom calls, I'm not answering.
- If the allergic dog client calls,

20:46.662 --> 20:49.914
I'm not answering it,
otherwise it's all yours.

20:50.040 --> 20:54.794
- Come on, let's see what happens.
- You do agree this is really stupid?

20:55.170 --> 20:59.131
- It's really stupid.
- Fucking stupid, come on, guys!

20:59.549 --> 21:00.549
Dad?

21:01.009 --> 21:03.135
- Sofia.
- Hi, Sofia!

21:03.262 --> 21:06.055
- Hello, everyone.
- She gets prettier every day.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.892
- She takes after her mother.
- Can you come here?

21:10.143 --> 21:11.811
Excuse me.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.024
Can I have some money, please?

21:17.943 --> 21:22.571
- Why didn't you ask in there?
- Not in front of mom.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.575
- What happened?
- The usual.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.786
You argued?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.831
- How old is Sofia?
- 17 in June.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.584
I remember when we celebrated
her birthday in Circeo.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.462
- She was 10, right?
- Yes, 10.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.589
- Seems like yesterday.
- Great...

21:40.716 --> 21:44.176
"Time flies by so fast!"
has been said.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.054
- "This used to be a farm..."
- "All Blacks have rhythm."

21:47.222 --> 21:49.849
Don't forget
"Pippo Baudo is very professional".

21:49.975 --> 21:53.477
- That's enough, guys.
- Hold it, first text.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.938
- It's mine.
- Shall we read it?

21:56.064 --> 21:57.606
Yes.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.112
"I want your body"?
Who's it from?

22:03.238 --> 22:06.365
- I don't know.
- We're off to a good start.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.992
What does it mean?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.744
- I don't know.
- Who sent it?

22:09.953 --> 22:12.121
The number's not in my phone,
I don't know.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.624
Must be the wrong number,
I don't know.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.002
What do I do?

22:19.755 --> 22:24.258
- It's the number from the text.
- Answer it.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.720
- Answer it.
- Yeah, right.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.640
- Put it on speaker.
- Yes. Take it easy.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.269
I'll put it on speaker.
Hello? Who is it?

22:39.274 --> 22:41.025
Hello?

22:42.277 --> 22:45.029
No answer...

22:45.614 --> 22:48.032
Hello? Who's that?
Who is it?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.368
It's fucking me.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.750
- What is wrong with you?
- It was a joke.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.127
- Fuck off!
- What kind of joke is that?

23:00.295 --> 23:03.381
- You're such a...
- He's a loser.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.257
- You're a loser.
- Really.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.303
- Just playing around.
- I knew it was a joke.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.306
- Go fuck yourself!
- Bullshit!

23:15.894 --> 23:17.895
Give me my phone, I'm going out.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.939
- Say bye at least.
- Bye.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.941
- Bye, Sofia.
- Bye, Sofia.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.778
- I said hello to them before.
- She said hello before.

23:28.198 --> 23:31.200
- She's not always like that.
- She's often worse.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.411
They're unbearable at that age.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.080
- What were you like at her age?
- Me?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.959
- What was he like?
- I remember what he was like.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.213
He was... help me out.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.799
Superficial.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.971
Perfect adjective. He only loved
soccer and something else.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.307
- Don't listen to him, darling.
- His mom was desperate.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.726
- Distraught.
- Whereas their mothers were happy.

23:58.353 --> 24:01.063
I'm not sure I'd be a good mother.

24:01.356 --> 24:04.942
- Why, are you pregnant?
- No, no...

24:05.110 --> 24:07.111
Are you trying?

24:09.865 --> 24:12.491
- You could say that.
- Congratulations then!

24:13.076 --> 24:15.870
There's nothing to celebrate yet.

24:15.996 --> 24:19.373
Well, at least someone's screwing!

24:19.875 --> 24:22.877
We haven't even eaten
the first course yet, easy!

24:23.003 --> 24:26.088
What's the big deal?
Nobody here would be shocked.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.214
So?

24:27.382 --> 24:32.261
After all these years of marriage,
no one screws like in the early days.

24:32.387 --> 24:35.389
They're trying for a baby,
it's not...

24:35.765 --> 24:39.894
A more sober toast then. To children
and the meaning they give our lives.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.897
Bummer,
I preferred the screwing toast.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.274
Peppe, you're never satisfied.

24:45.484 --> 24:50.488
I don't like this idea that life has
no meaning if you don't have kids.

24:50.780 --> 24:54.783
- It's sometimes a convenient decision.
- What do you mean?

24:55.410 --> 25:00.998
You have a kid, get on with life
and think of nothing else.

25:01.249 --> 25:05.169
- I don't want a kid just to do that.
- Why else then?

25:05.378 --> 25:07.796
- For a thousand reasons.
- Give me one.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.425
- One. To complete the couple.
- For example.

25:11.801 --> 25:15.930
So two people can't be happy
without depending on someone else.

25:16.014 --> 25:19.266
- You're a pain!
- The other day we argued about God.

25:19.392 --> 25:23.312
It's the same thing in the end.
I don't want their help.

25:23.396 --> 25:26.148
I want to be
the meaning of my own life.

25:26.274 --> 25:29.818
I'm selfish and I'll die selfish.
Cheers.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.322
Sometimes having children
can be selfish.

25:34.157 --> 25:40.037
- Why selfish?
- It's a generous act, isn't it?

25:40.205 --> 25:43.457
No, sometimes it can just be
the fear of growing old.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.794
Many hope a child
can give them a second life.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.965
I don't torment myself about it.
I've enjoyed having a daughter.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.218
I agree with Rocco.
You can make fun of me,

25:54.344 --> 25:57.846
but the best moment of the day
is when I put Rosa to bed.

25:57.973 --> 26:02.977
She looks at me and says I'm so
beautiful. That makes me happy...

26:03.353 --> 26:07.064
- Happy, happy...
- We get the message, you're happy.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.109
- Did she say "happy"?
- There was an echo.

26:10.235 --> 26:15.239
We'll talk again when she's 16
and tells you to piss off.

26:15.448 --> 26:20.619
Don't say that, and it's true,
kids give you a second chance.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.331
It's like going over your life
again through them.

26:24.457 --> 26:28.335
You see, I don't want
to go over my life again.

26:28.461 --> 26:32.381
Because you had a shitty life.
I wasn't joking.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.136
- It's my sister, what do I do?
- Answer it.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.222
- Put it on speaker.
- Hi, Marta.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.891
- Peppe, the speaker.
- Wait a minute.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:46.896 --> 26:50.899
- Careful, you're on speaker.
- That's not fair!

26:51.026 --> 26:54.153
- Speaker?
- Yes, you're on speaker.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.531
- You can't tell her.
- Turn it off.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.159
- I can't.
- Why not?

27:00.285 --> 27:03.162
- I just can't, Marta.
- What's all that noise?

27:03.288 --> 27:06.040
- I'm at Rocco and Eva's.
- Game over.

27:06.249 --> 27:10.044
- Hello, Marta.
- Hello, everyone. Okay...

27:10.295 --> 27:14.048
- I'll call back.
- I'm not going to Anzio, got it?

27:14.257 --> 27:16.675
We'll talk about it tomorrow. Bye.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.930
- Sorry, I messed up.
- You messed up?

27:22.057 --> 27:24.683
I wasn't ready.
I'll get it right next time.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.395
- What was that about Anzio?
- My sister found me a job

27:28.521 --> 27:30.314
in a private school.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.941
- Why not go?
- It's too far away.

27:33.151 --> 27:38.072
- You can't be picky these days.
- It'd be nice to work at the seaside.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.908
I'd jump at the chance
to move to Anzio.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.287
What was that?

27:45.455 --> 27:48.082
- You'd jump at the chance to move...
- To Anzio.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.959
Yes, why not?

27:51.086 --> 27:53.921
You'd move to Anzio tomorrow?

27:54.089 --> 27:58.342
- Tomorrow, you'd move...
- She heard. We said it three times.

27:58.468 --> 28:02.429
Okay, I only said it
to encourage Peppe.

28:02.597 --> 28:06.100
- He's not a kid, you know.
- I've sent my resume everywhere.

28:06.434 --> 28:10.229
- Something will turn up.
- It doesn't work that way.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.233
- Am I on trial?
- Anyway, they can't fire you like that.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.320
They didn't, they just didn't renew
my contract, it's different.

28:18.613 --> 28:23.242
It's worse. You've had a temporary
contract for the last 10 years.

28:23.451 --> 28:28.497
- It's illegal, you could sue.
- Thanks, but I don't need help.

28:28.623 --> 28:32.626
I want to solve this on my own,
without any pressure.

28:32.877 --> 28:36.255
- And without going to Anzio.
- That's right, take your time...

28:36.589 --> 28:39.508
- Peppe, get a fucking move on!
- That's enough!

28:40.093 --> 28:45.723
As soon as I shut the shop,
I bought a taxi.

28:46.224 --> 28:50.018
- Let's follow his example!
- Joke all you want.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.522
I'm moving ahead,
I've put my taxi license up for sale.

28:54.357 --> 28:57.651
- You haven't started paying for it yet.
- You're selling it?

28:57.986 --> 29:01.238
- I want to see what it's worth.
- When were you going to tell me?

29:01.406 --> 29:03.741
- I was going to.
- When?

29:04.033 --> 29:07.119
- It's only an idea, it's not...
- As usual.

29:07.662 --> 29:11.039
- This time it's the right decision.
- It always is.

29:11.624 --> 29:15.669
Guys, the world's changing fast.
Car2go, car-sharing...

29:15.795 --> 29:19.798
Uber. Ever heard of them?
Taxis will be extinct soon.

29:20.175 --> 29:23.677
- So I'm looking to the future.
- Like with e-cigarettes.

29:25.388 --> 29:30.392
- He had bad luck that time.
- I blame the tobacco lobby.

29:30.518 --> 29:35.063
They financed the revolution
in Nicaragua.

29:35.273 --> 29:40.068
- Which is situated exactly...
- I'll tell you later where it is.

29:40.278 --> 29:43.322
- But at least I tried.
- Like when you bred Yorkshires.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.076
You're indefensible.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.454
Were Lady and the Tramp
to blame that time?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.456
Come on...

29:52.582 --> 29:54.792
Pass me that plate?

29:57.337 --> 30:02.090
- You baked the zucchini flowers?
- Did you want them fried? Lele!

30:06.471 --> 30:09.181
- Did you get your license back?
- No.

30:09.599 --> 30:13.727
- Not until the trial is over.
- When's the hearing?

30:14.729 --> 30:17.356
- At the end of June.
- Are you worried?

30:18.316 --> 30:21.568
No, just tired.
I can't wait until it's all over.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.615
- Is everything sorted?
- The lawyer says I'll be cleared.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.492
We'll celebrate this summer then.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.620
Who is it?

30:33.206 --> 30:35.123
It's dad.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.501
- Zucchini flowers...
- I'm famished.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.628
- Sit down.
- Put it on speaker.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.634
- Hi, dad.
- Hello, darling, how are you?

30:45.760 --> 30:49.012
- Fine, I've got friends for dinner.
- I won't keep you then.

30:49.222 --> 30:52.599
I spoke to Blanchard, he said
you can have the operation in Rome.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.727
He comes down twice a month
to the Quisisana Clinic.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.146
I'll send you his number,
call him.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.358
Thanks, dad, bye.
Say hello to mom.

31:02.861 --> 31:07.531
- What operation is that?
- It's nothing serious.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.160
Augmentation mammoplasty.

31:16.165 --> 31:18.292
I'm getting a boob job.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.377
- A boob job?
- Yes.

31:20.753 --> 31:23.422
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're a therapist!

31:23.631 --> 31:26.550
- So what?
- Therapists don't get boob jobs.

31:26.801 --> 31:30.679
- It does seem strange.
- Why? I don't like my boobs.

31:31.389 --> 31:37.185
- You should make yourself like them.
- Therapists should accept themselves.

31:37.645 --> 31:41.398
A woman who has a boob job
doesn't accept herself?

31:42.692 --> 31:44.526
No.

31:46.195 --> 31:50.324
- I accept everything but my boobs.
- Let Rocco do it.

31:50.533 --> 31:53.285
- Why don't you do it?
- Why don't I do it?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.579
Because her consultant father said no.

31:56.789 --> 32:01.585
Only the best for his daughter.
Dr. Blanchard, a VIP surgeon

32:01.836 --> 32:07.299
who operates in Italy, but lives
in Switzerland. Not Rocco Buccilli.

32:07.467 --> 32:11.178
Who does boob and ass jobs
for cashiers and secretaries.

32:11.304 --> 32:14.348
I do two for one:
two boobs for the price of one.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.684
- Are you done?
- It's true.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.354
- No.
- Then enlighten me.

32:21.230 --> 32:23.941
A husband can't do
his wife's boob job.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.443
It's a matter of common sense.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.946
You'd lose all sexual attraction.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.824
- I agree with Eva.
- The cook never feels like eating.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.744
- That's a good one.
- He does it all the time.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.747
He says, "You know what?
You eat it all!"

32:38.873 --> 32:42.250
This is the official reason,
her father considers me an idiot.

32:42.752 --> 32:46.213
- That's not true.
- He wanted a heart surgeon for her.

32:46.339 --> 32:50.217
- A luminary like himself.
- That's enough.

32:50.385 --> 32:55.472
Why don't you let Blanchard do one
boob, and your husband the other?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.517
- Without knowing which one.
- Then decide which is better.

32:58.768 --> 33:03.355
No, get daddy to decide:
"Dad, which is Blanchard's boob?"

33:04.399 --> 33:08.860
I really shouldn't say this,
but she doesn't need it.

33:09.362 --> 33:13.240
- He paid you a compliment.
- It must be the eclipse.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.660
Eva's right, it's like you
going to her for therapy.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.290
It's unthinkable, right?

33:22.542 --> 33:27.546
You don't get it, it would be
unthinkable for him to go to therapy!

33:27.755 --> 33:32.551
I'm put off by how long it takes,
but I'd like to try.

33:32.677 --> 33:36.430
You're good at sitting
on a sofa for hours!

33:36.514 --> 33:39.683
You're a real comedian tonight!

33:39.809 --> 33:44.646
This need to talk about
my private business to a stranger...

33:44.772 --> 33:48.442
No offense Eva,
but it's not for me.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.902
You can talk to friends instead.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.448
- I have him...
- And it's free too.

33:54.657 --> 33:59.327
He won't go because he thinks
therapy is a waste of time.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.582
Admit it, I won't be offended.
You think my job is a waste of time.

34:03.791 --> 34:06.835
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's what you think.

34:06.961 --> 34:10.297
I don't, I think we do
very similar jobs.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.467
You do brain jobs, I do boob jobs.
We make people feel better,

34:13.592 --> 34:17.344
it's just that you take years,
and I take a few hours.

34:19.681 --> 34:21.433
- Whose is that?
- Not mine.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.351
- Not mine.
- Calm down.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.937
- It's the gnocchi.
- I'll go.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.608
- Hand me your plates.
- Thanks, Carlotta.

34:31.985 --> 34:34.112
- I'll go smoke.
- I'll come with you.

34:44.456 --> 34:48.085
- What's the moon like?
- It's partly covered.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.342
- Peppe, I've got a problem.
- What kind?

34:57.011 --> 34:59.387
Well...

34:59.514 --> 35:02.724
every night at 10:00
a friend of mine...

35:03.643 --> 35:06.520
- She sends me...
- A goodnight kiss?

35:07.396 --> 35:10.524
Sort of.
She sends me a photo.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.653
- She sends you a photo!
- A photo.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.780
What kind of photo?

35:16.906 --> 35:18.740
A photo of herself.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.662
You're in trouble.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.997
I need you to help me out.

35:27.166 --> 35:31.795
- How can I help you?
- We have the same phone.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.923
We'll swap them,
just until the photo arrives.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.176
- Then I'll receive the photo. Come on!
- But you're single.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.762
No, pal, not any more.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.931
Okay, but Lucilla's
not here with you tonight.

35:43.057 --> 35:46.560
- You could have refused to play.
- I'm in the shit. Help!

35:46.686 --> 35:48.562
No, I don't want to.

35:48.688 --> 35:52.691
Do you want all hell to break loose
for something so petty?

35:53.818 --> 35:57.445
Peppe doesn't want to
so he'll ruin an entire family.

36:06.038 --> 36:09.666
And what kind of photos
are you talking about?

36:09.792 --> 36:14.337
- Just an ordinary photo.
- Don't show me up, or else...

36:14.547 --> 36:19.050
Peppe, two nights ago she sent me
a photo of her in Pluto pajamas.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.846
- You see...
- Pluto?

36:22.972 --> 36:25.432
- Pluto.
- How old is she?

36:27.101 --> 36:29.060
I don't know.

36:32.481 --> 36:35.984
- Are you going to help me or not?
- What a pain!

36:41.199 --> 36:44.743
I'm not sure I should tell you,
but your husband's in therapy.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.246
Rocco?

36:51.834 --> 36:53.835
Are you serious?

36:54.003 --> 36:55.962
Who told you?

36:56.088 --> 36:58.965
Lele.
But don't say a word, okay?

37:00.718 --> 37:02.886
Whose phone is that? Mine?

37:03.763 --> 37:05.764
Who is it?

37:08.601 --> 37:10.227
- Steve Jobs.
- Who?

37:11.646 --> 37:15.023
- I thought he was dead.
- And why would he call my wife?

37:15.483 --> 37:17.609
- Darling!
- I'm coming!

37:17.985 --> 37:20.904
- It's urgent.
- Who is it? Mom?

37:21.530 --> 37:23.782
No... Steve Jobs.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.535
- Answer it.
- I don't speak English.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.913
Answer it! Don't be silly!

37:32.667 --> 37:35.043
- Hello, Riccardo.
- Good evening, Mrs. Masi.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.671
- Your computer's ready.
- Great.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.800
- How come you're working so late?
- Overtime, too many viruses about.

37:43.302 --> 37:47.055
I'll come get it tomorrow
around 7:00?

37:47.181 --> 37:50.058
- Sounds good.
- See you tomorrow.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.936
It's the computer guy.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.689
- And you call him "Steve Jobs"?
- Isn't it funny?

37:55.815 --> 37:58.692
And do you call the mechanic
"Marchionne"?

38:01.279 --> 38:05.699
- Text. One, two...
- Giulio for soccer.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.202
- Giulio soccer.
- Giulio, confirmed for tomorrow.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.955
- You were lucky.
- There's a game tomorrow?

38:14.458 --> 38:17.919
- Apparently.
- I didn't get a text.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.173
It'll come through,
it might just be a bit late.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.926
Is your phone out of minutes?

38:26.679 --> 38:30.849
- Have you kicked me off the team?
- No, Giulio just organized it...

38:30.975 --> 38:34.185
- You know what he's like.
- What is he like?

38:34.478 --> 38:37.105
- Absent-minded.
- Don't you know Giulio?

38:38.107 --> 38:41.234
Get your gym bag ready anyway.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.111
Yes, come anyway.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.867
You're such shits, you only include me
when you're short a goalie.

38:49.243 --> 38:53.371
- Do you really do that?
- That's not true.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.123
- Nonsense.
- Terrible!

38:55.583 --> 39:00.837
- Are you Alice in Wonderland?
- Why? If they're such good friends...

39:00.963 --> 39:04.132
Some friends! I didn't
get a message on WhatsApp.

39:05.259 --> 39:08.636
Turn it off then back on again,
sometimes...

39:08.763 --> 39:12.724
- He's right, sometimes...
- You're such shits.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.853
Message for Cosimo. Who is it?

39:18.856 --> 39:21.274
Marika.
"Call me, it's urgent."

39:21.650 --> 39:26.029
- Three exclamation points.
- Who's Marika, what's so urgent?

39:26.864 --> 39:29.157
- Who is she?
- The name sounds promising.

39:29.784 --> 39:33.661
Sorry to disappoint you, but
she's just the taxi company dispatcher.

39:35.164 --> 39:40.001
You know? "Go to Corso Rinascimento
in nine minutes."

39:40.127 --> 39:42.253
Call her back, I'm curious about her.

39:44.048 --> 39:48.009
We're eating and she might make me
fill in for someone.

39:48.135 --> 39:52.055
- Yes, a shift swap.
- Look at her defending her husband!

39:52.181 --> 39:56.684
- They haven't been married long!
- Darling, stick up for yourself.

39:57.937 --> 40:01.064
If I have to fill in for someone,
my weekend's ruined.

40:01.190 --> 40:05.193
- We're at my parents' on Sunday.
- Then she'll save your weekend.

40:09.198 --> 40:12.325
Anyway, Marika isn't his type.
She's a hick

40:12.701 --> 40:15.954
with tattoos and enormous boobs!

40:16.080 --> 40:19.165
What's her surname?
Perhaps I did her boob job.

40:23.170 --> 40:26.965
- It's mine, an American app.
- Can I see?

40:30.678 --> 40:33.430
- Where are you going?
- What is this?

40:33.806 --> 40:36.099
- An exercise program.
- What?

40:36.225 --> 40:40.478
It lasts 12 weeks

40:40.855 --> 40:43.731
and you can lose
from 8 to 12 kilos.

40:43.941 --> 40:47.360
- Guaranteed success.
- You only started today then!

40:47.486 --> 40:50.113
- Do you have to do it now?
- Whenever it pings.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.074
- Even at night?
- Yes, if it pings.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.869
- Then turn it off.
- I can't cheat.

40:56.078 --> 40:59.247
How can I teach P.E.
looking like this?

40:59.457 --> 41:02.959
Does the app know you ate half
a kilo of gnocchi in 30 seconds?

41:03.085 --> 41:05.462
- I'm burning them off.
- Dammit...

41:09.133 --> 41:14.220
That's brilliant. Where did
you find it? I want it too.

41:15.264 --> 41:18.892
- I downloaded it.
- Have you heard of it? I haven't.

41:19.018 --> 41:22.145
- On a full stomach.
- I swapped our phones.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.107
- Are you sure?
- Huh?

41:26.400 --> 41:28.735
- Are we sure?
- Don't bust my balls.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.744
Why didn't you tell me?

41:37.786 --> 41:40.413
- What?
- That you're in therapy.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.291
Why didn't you tell me?

41:47.004 --> 41:50.131
- I haven't been going long.
- How long?

41:50.758 --> 41:52.800
About six months.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.928
That's long enough.

41:56.138 --> 41:58.264
- Are you angry?
- No.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.392
Yes...

42:03.020 --> 42:05.063
I don't know, a bit.

42:06.273 --> 42:09.192
- You never wanted to before.
- I do now.

42:09.944 --> 42:12.445
You do now? Why?

42:12.780 --> 42:16.199
Maybe it is just a waste of time,
but I want to try everything.

42:17.451 --> 42:21.955
Then if we split up,
we can't say we didn't try.

42:26.293 --> 42:30.046
- And is it working?
- I don't know, you tell me.

42:40.307 --> 42:43.726
- But I've learnt something important.
- What's that?

42:44.853 --> 42:48.606
- How to defuse.
- Meaning?

42:48.941 --> 42:53.111
Not to turn every argument
into a fight for supremacy.

42:53.445 --> 42:57.323
I don't believe it's weak
to be the one to give in.

42:57.491 --> 42:59.617
In fact, I think it's wise.

42:59.994 --> 43:04.372
The only couples I see who last
are those where one of the two...

43:04.498 --> 43:08.334
manages to take a step back,
but is really a step ahead.

43:11.880 --> 43:16.009
I don't want us to end up like...
Barbie and Ken.

43:18.345 --> 43:21.264
You full of plastic
and me without any balls.

43:26.604 --> 43:31.024
- I'll change my shirt, it's sticky.
- Good idea.

43:42.786 --> 43:46.164
- The wine's good.
- WhatsApp for Peppe.

43:46.290 --> 43:49.542
- The only one who's not worried.
- It's a photo.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.919
From Isa Clementini.

43:52.046 --> 43:56.007
- Wait, it's not Lucilla!
- Why are you shouting?

43:56.133 --> 44:00.011
- To emphasize it.
- Isa Clementini sometimes sends me...

44:03.932 --> 44:05.266
You'll break it.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.685
- What's up?
- Nothing...

44:07.936 --> 44:09.937
- What is it?
- Can I have a look?

44:10.064 --> 44:12.940
- It's private.
- Everyone's sharing tonight.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.652
- Let us see.
- Show us or I'll get up...

44:17.196 --> 44:20.156
- Show us that photo.
- Get your hand off it!

44:20.324 --> 44:23.076
- Let go!
- Okay.

44:23.452 --> 44:26.162
Tonight everyone can look...

44:28.040 --> 44:30.416
Well I'll be damned, Peppe!

44:30.459 --> 44:32.710
- You chipped it.
- Let me see.

44:32.961 --> 44:36.339
- Just a sec!
- You have to see this.

44:36.674 --> 44:41.552
You're in the field, how do you...
Which way do you look at this?

44:41.679 --> 44:43.680
- Whose is it?
- Guess.

44:44.223 --> 44:47.183
- Looks like she's lying face down.
- Who is she?

44:47.351 --> 44:49.602
- It's not for you.
- What is it?

44:49.978 --> 44:51.437
No, no, no...

44:56.485 --> 44:58.611
Have you seen Peppe's girlfriend!

44:58.737 --> 45:02.365
She's not my girlfriend, do you
think I'd have a girlfriend like that?

45:02.491 --> 45:06.202
- She's doing pilates.
- No, the Sun Salutation.

45:08.455 --> 45:13.251
Peppe had no one for years after
his divorce, now girlfriends, lovers...

45:13.460 --> 45:17.004
You don't have to explain.
1 ,000 points for Peppe.

45:17.131 --> 45:20.341
- Yes, right.
- Hooray for Miss Clementini.

45:22.010 --> 45:24.470
What's that? A text?

45:24.638 --> 45:27.140
- Who got a text?
- You did.

45:27.266 --> 45:30.101
- It's mine, here.
- A frog ring tone?

45:30.269 --> 45:31.728
Who, me?

45:32.020 --> 45:35.773
Do you think I'm that stupid?
The kids must've done it.

45:36.525 --> 45:39.402
"How are you?"
How sweet...

45:40.154 --> 45:41.237
Who's Lucio?

45:41.405 --> 45:43.740
A co-worker from the legal office.

45:44.491 --> 45:47.744
- I don't remember him.
- You were on maternity leave.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.163
He's a nice guy.

45:50.539 --> 45:53.291
Why's he asking how you are?

45:53.417 --> 45:57.253
Because today I lost my temper
about that case in Basilicata

45:57.421 --> 45:59.130
that's been dragging on.

45:59.256 --> 46:00.673
He noticed I was a bit...

46:01.300 --> 46:03.509
- And you're not replying?
- No.

46:06.054 --> 46:10.183
I don't understand people
who don't answer texts.

46:10.559 --> 46:12.268
It won't take a second.

46:12.519 --> 46:17.190
This person was kind enough
to ask...

46:17.524 --> 46:21.569
All you have to say is,
"I'm fine, I'm at home."

46:21.695 --> 46:24.697
- That's right.
- Why? He's not at home.

46:26.408 --> 46:28.701
- That's right.
- I was just saying...

46:28.827 --> 46:33.664
Then write, "I'm fine, thanks.
I'm having dinner with friends."

46:33.791 --> 46:37.293
- That's right.
- Why must he say where he is?

46:39.588 --> 46:42.840
It's just a matter of principle.

46:43.175 --> 46:46.594
We don't have any privacy any more.
Once phone calls started with:

46:46.720 --> 46:49.597
"How are you?"
Now it's: "Where are you?"

46:50.182 --> 46:53.726
- No, he asked "how are you?"
- That's my business!

46:54.061 --> 46:57.480
Okay?
Why should I tell you where I am?

46:57.731 --> 47:00.858
Why?
And why the fuck would you care?

47:01.235 --> 47:05.446
- Why are you taking it out on me?
- These things are ruining our lives.

47:05.572 --> 47:08.115
They're taking our private lives
away from us.

47:08.325 --> 47:12.119
And we're allowing them to,
day after day, without realizing it.

47:17.125 --> 47:19.836
- Okay, I won't answer it.
- Good, don't answer it.

47:21.088 --> 47:24.257
Guys, this eclipse is having
a bad effect on you.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.717
Rocco, you've got an email.

47:27.636 --> 47:31.389
- I've got a text too.
- No, first Rocco's email.

47:31.515 --> 47:32.849
Scared?

47:33.642 --> 47:35.601
Scared of what?

47:35.644 --> 47:38.604
Orizzonti Tour.
The house in Salina's confirmed.

47:38.772 --> 47:41.524
- Thank goodness!
- You were lucky.

47:42.484 --> 47:45.403
Let's read Carlotta's text.

47:45.612 --> 47:48.656
No, I want to read one out.

47:49.783 --> 47:53.160
I've learnt something I want to...

47:53.370 --> 47:55.663
Siri, read email.

47:57.165 --> 47:59.166
You have no new email.

47:59.293 --> 48:01.794
Not even Siri understands you.
What email?

48:02.170 --> 48:04.297
- It's a message.
- A message.

48:05.382 --> 48:07.425
Siri, read the message.

48:10.512 --> 48:15.266
You have a message
from +393462371733.

48:15.392 --> 48:17.768
Dear Mrs. De Rosa,
we'd like to inform you

48:17.936 --> 48:20.187
we have a spot
available in June.

48:20.564 --> 48:24.525
During this time
we're offering a 25% discount.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.570
Do not hesitate to call us
for further information.

48:27.779 --> 48:31.824
Thank you for contacting us.
La Quiete Home for the Elderly.

48:33.785 --> 48:36.329
- Do you want to answer?
- I don't want to answer.

48:36.455 --> 48:39.415
Who sends messages at this hour?!
They're crazy!

48:39.583 --> 48:42.835
- La Quiete? Is it a rest home?
- No...

48:43.211 --> 48:47.340
I went there last week with
my friend Rita, her mom's there.

48:47.424 --> 48:51.218
It's lovely, I had a look around
and asked for some information.

48:51.345 --> 48:53.846
- That's all.
- That's all?

48:54.848 --> 48:57.183
You asked for information
at a rest home?

48:57.309 --> 49:02.563
That's like going to a funeral and
asking if there's a tomb available.

49:02.689 --> 49:05.358
It's not a rest home.
it's a five-star facility.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.234
So what?

49:07.444 --> 49:09.946
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I forgot.

49:10.364 --> 49:13.366
I didn't even save the number.

49:15.577 --> 49:17.620
I don't believe it.

49:17.746 --> 49:20.498
You want to kick mom out.

49:20.707 --> 49:24.710
Don't pass me off as something I'm not.
I'm not kicking anyone out.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.837
- That woman adores you.
- I know.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.632
She helps us out with the kids,
with everything.

49:30.258 --> 49:32.718
- Or am I mistaken?
- You're not mistaken, but...

49:32.886 --> 49:35.388
But what?

49:35.597 --> 49:39.850
I love her too, you know that.
But ever since she's been with us,

49:39.977 --> 49:42.853
our dynamics have changed.
Admit it.

49:44.898 --> 49:48.734
Sure... mom, who sleeps
in a cubicle at the end of the hall,

49:48.860 --> 49:52.405
is to blame for our problems.
Yes, that's possible.

49:52.781 --> 49:56.659
Pretend I never said anything.
We don't have problems, it's fine.

49:57.285 --> 50:02.415
I'm fond of Cosimo's mom too,
but if she came to live with us...

50:02.541 --> 50:05.292
I'm sorry, darling,
but I couldn't cope.

50:05.419 --> 50:08.921
With my mother? I wouldn't want
to live with her either.

50:09.297 --> 50:13.509
Some facilities are so nice
that old folks beg to go there.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.762
- It's like a resort.
- Did she tell you to say that?

50:16.888 --> 50:20.266
Would you live with Carlotta's mom?

50:20.308 --> 50:23.310
- My mother's a widow. Hers isn't.
- Mine isn't.

50:24.563 --> 50:29.817
Lele's right... but she can be a pain
in the ass when she wants to be.

50:31.278 --> 50:34.572
I got more slaps from your mom
than from my dad.

50:34.781 --> 50:38.325
- Obviously not enough.
- Your mom's not bursting with charm.

50:39.411 --> 50:43.164
Okay, I'll admit she can be
a bit difficult.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.334
- What time it is?
- Just after ten.

50:47.461 --> 50:49.587
- Let's go and see the eclipse.
- Yes!

50:49.796 --> 50:52.715
- Leave the phones on the table.
- Can I take mine? For a photo.

50:52.841 --> 50:56.343
- Okay, just you. Not you!
- Come on, the eclipse!

50:56.470 --> 50:59.930
They're well-organized.
As soon as they bury one,

51:00.057 --> 51:02.349
they send out a message
to find a replacement.

51:02.476 --> 51:07.104
- No joke, they were fully booked.
- I should open a nursing home.

51:07.481 --> 51:10.816
Open one in the hills.
Capers outside, old folks inside.

51:11.485 --> 51:14.320
It's lovely, though
I still see two of them.

51:14.696 --> 51:16.864
There are two,
one on top of the other.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.702
- Lovely, isn't it?
- Yes.

51:21.828 --> 51:24.622
It won't last much longer,
then it'll disappear.

51:24.831 --> 51:29.877
Listen, I'm sorry about before,
I said it without thinking.

51:30.003 --> 51:33.964
- I wouldn't want you to be upset.
- I'm not upset.

51:36.760 --> 51:40.888
I wonder why eclipses
fascinate us so much.

51:43.642 --> 51:46.894
- The Dark Side of the Moon!
- Great record!

51:53.026 --> 51:55.277
Let's take a photo, come over here.

51:56.404 --> 51:57.863
- Who'll take it?
- I will.

52:00.992 --> 52:03.661
- Squeeze together.
- I'll bend down or we won't fit.

52:03.870 --> 52:06.664
Wait, darling, I'll do it. Hold it...

52:06.915 --> 52:09.917
- Everyone in? Smile.
- One...

52:10.794 --> 52:12.253
"Hi".

52:14.506 --> 52:17.299
- What does he want on a Friday night?
- I don't know.

52:17.551 --> 52:18.676
- Who's Ivano?
- Her ex.

52:18.885 --> 52:21.011
- He's pissed.
- No.

52:21.388 --> 52:24.515
- I'm joking.
- Let's take the photo.

52:27.435 --> 52:31.814
- Why did you save his number as Ivano?
- How else? That's his name.

52:32.023 --> 52:34.525
- By his surname.
- Come on, he's her ex!

52:34.693 --> 52:36.569
- Precisely!
- Exes are dangerous.

52:36.778 --> 52:39.446
They're like the Japanese,
they never give up.

52:39.698 --> 52:41.407
Especially if they got dumped.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.826
That's right.
Bianca? Bianca?

52:44.911 --> 52:46.579
- Who broke it off?
- Me.

52:46.788 --> 52:48.914
Come on, take this photo.

52:49.082 --> 52:51.333
He's harmless,
but it's the principle...

52:51.459 --> 52:52.918
Smile!

52:54.045 --> 52:55.838
One, two...

52:55.964 --> 52:59.466
"I feel like screwing"

53:01.678 --> 53:05.181
- Good thing he was harmless.
- What the fuck?

53:05.223 --> 53:08.350
- I can explain.
- It says, "I feel like screwing"!

53:08.602 --> 53:11.687
- It could be predictive text.
- Shut the fuck up.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.856
- Let me explain.
- Go on then.

53:13.982 --> 53:18.110
Ivano's in a relationship
with this girl, it's all about sex.

53:18.236 --> 53:21.739
Well, it is for her but he's in love,

53:21.865 --> 53:24.575
but won't admit it
and he's suffering like a dog.

53:24.743 --> 53:28.078
- That's why he called the vet.
- Well?

53:29.748 --> 53:32.082
Well?
Why's he texting you?

53:33.251 --> 53:36.879
I don't know what's so funny.
What's so funny?

53:37.005 --> 53:42.760
- I tell you what, he can explain.
- No, there's really no need.

53:42.886 --> 53:47.014
Please, there's nothing to explain.
It's pointless, just stop.

53:47.641 --> 53:48.974
- All right?
- Quiet everyone.

53:53.772 --> 53:57.024
Hey, thanks for calling.
I'm sorry to be a pain, Bianca.

53:57.150 --> 53:59.151
- Did she call you?
- Yes.

53:59.778 --> 54:02.029
- And?
- She asked me over.

54:02.656 --> 54:05.032
- Don't go.
- I can't help myself.

54:05.158 --> 54:08.994
- She gets to me, I want to go.
- But she'll only hurt you.

54:09.246 --> 54:12.248
- I'm hurting enough as it is.
- It'll be worse if you go.

54:12.916 --> 54:16.919
- Some help you are!
- At least I'm trying to help.

54:17.295 --> 54:20.297
Otherwise don't bother calling,
you know what I think.

54:20.674 --> 54:24.051
- What a pain! Bye.
- Bye... Ivano!

54:24.427 --> 54:27.888
- Don't go there!
- Okay... bye.

54:30.809 --> 54:34.144
- Satisfied?
- How often do you talk?

54:34.437 --> 54:38.190
- Now and then.
- How often is now and then?

54:38.817 --> 54:41.318
- Every time he wants to...
- I get it.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.445
He panics and calls me.

54:44.906 --> 54:48.450
Give him Eva's number,
he needs a therapist, not an ex.

54:48.827 --> 54:51.954
- Guys, the meatloaf's ready.
- Unbelievable!

54:55.458 --> 54:59.420
- Why didn't you tell me you talk?
- Because it's not important.

54:59.796 --> 55:03.299
- There's nothing to tell.
- You say we should share everything.

55:03.425 --> 55:05.843
Everything that's important
for our relationship.

55:06.553 --> 55:10.973
- I think he still wants to screw you.
- And that seems very important.

55:11.099 --> 55:13.309
- Don't be silly!
- Yeah, don't be silly.

55:14.227 --> 55:18.230
- I don't talk to my exes.
- No, they'd prefer you dead.

55:18.356 --> 55:23.110
If it bothers you, I'll call him
and tell him not to call any more.

55:23.236 --> 55:26.238
- Right, you tell him.
- Then Cosimo is happy

55:26.364 --> 55:29.742
and you can speak to Ivano in secret.

55:29.868 --> 55:32.369
If I tell Cosimo I won't talk to him,
then I won't.

55:32.746 --> 55:36.874
Why shouldn't you talk to him?
He's a friend, Cosimo should trust you.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.877
I trust her, but I can't stand him.
Alright?

55:41.755 --> 55:46.383
- Doesn't Ivano have a house in Anzio?
- Yes, that's why she wanted to go.

55:46.593 --> 55:49.011
Yes, of course!

55:52.015 --> 55:55.392
- Does he really have a house there?
- You really are crazy!

55:55.518 --> 55:59.897
- I don't even know him!
- I'm not in the mood, Lele.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.399
I can see that.

56:04.402 --> 56:06.403
- It's Sofia.
- Answer it.

56:09.866 --> 56:13.410
- Hello, darling. Are you okay?
- Hi, dad. Yes, I'm fine.

56:13.912 --> 56:17.414
- Can you talk?
- Yes, of course. Go ahead.

56:17.749 --> 56:21.794
I don't know how to tell you this,
but Gregorio's parents are away.

56:21.920 --> 56:25.923
And he's asked me to go...
to sleep there.

56:27.884 --> 56:29.927
Dad, are you still there?

56:30.553 --> 56:34.181
- And what did you say?
- I don't know, I want to.

56:34.307 --> 56:37.434
But I wasn't expecting it tonight.

56:37.560 --> 56:40.813
If I don't go, he might be upset.
What shall I do?

56:41.022 --> 56:44.942
Don't go just because he'd be upset.
That can't be the only reason.

56:45.151 --> 56:47.194
Of course it's not...

56:48.321 --> 56:51.532
And don't expect me
to be enthusiastic about it.

56:51.825 --> 56:53.325
Come on, dad...

56:54.327 --> 56:58.330
But there is something
I want to say.

56:59.207 --> 57:04.420
This is an important moment,
something you'll remember all your life.

57:06.923 --> 57:10.467
It's not just something
to tell your friends tomorrow.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.554
If you think that later...

57:15.098 --> 57:18.350
whenever you look back on it,
it'll make you smile...

57:20.311 --> 57:22.604
then go ahead.

57:23.356 --> 57:26.108
But if you don't feel like it,
if you're not sure,

57:26.359 --> 57:28.360
then forget about it.

57:30.113 --> 57:32.114
Because you have plenty of time.

57:33.992 --> 57:36.243
- Do you know what?
- What?

57:36.369 --> 57:39.246
- Never mind.
- No, tell me.

57:39.873 --> 57:43.000
You embarrassed me today
when you gave me those condoms.

57:43.376 --> 57:45.502
I didn't know where to look.

57:45.628 --> 57:48.589
I didn't tell you to use them.

57:49.007 --> 57:53.093
Why then? I think you knew,
you have a sixth sense.

57:53.219 --> 57:56.263
You've never done it before.
Anyway...

57:56.890 --> 58:00.142
If I do go to Gregorio's,
tell mom I'm at Chicca's.

58:00.602 --> 58:03.395
- Why don't you tell her?
- What?

58:03.521 --> 58:05.522
- The truth.
- Are you crazy?

58:05.648 --> 58:08.901
- I've told you to talk to her.
- You know what she's like.

58:09.027 --> 58:11.987
She never listens, just gets angry.

58:12.280 --> 58:16.533
- Have a little bit of patience.
- A lot of patience.

58:17.410 --> 58:19.369
Okay, a lot of patience.

58:19.913 --> 58:23.415
But I think it's worth a try.
Try it.

58:23.666 --> 58:27.044
You're too in love with mom
to see what a bitch she is.

58:28.004 --> 58:31.006
- Okay, I have to go. Thanks.
- Sofia...

58:45.939 --> 58:48.190
You did really well.

58:52.445 --> 58:55.447
The therapy must be working.

58:57.158 --> 58:58.450
Bianca...

58:59.452 --> 59:02.287
- Did you tell her?
- No.

59:03.039 --> 59:07.084
- You told her.
- Okay, but I only told her.

59:09.045 --> 59:12.464
- And I only told Peppe.
- And I... Only Lele.

59:12.590 --> 59:16.593
- And Lele kept it to himself.
- She's my wife...

59:16.803 --> 59:19.304
She's my best friend.

59:23.476 --> 59:25.602
- Sorry...
- Don't be.

59:25.979 --> 59:30.607
He's seeing a therapist,
not a whore! Come on!

59:30.984 --> 59:32.442
Right...

59:33.486 --> 59:35.195
There's the frog again.

59:35.572 --> 59:39.616
- Lucio wants you to answer him.
- Why's he insisting?

59:39.742 --> 59:43.120
Answer him, then he might stop.

59:43.246 --> 59:46.248
Perhaps I'd better,
or he won't leave me alone.

59:47.000 --> 59:51.336
"I'm having dinner with friends,
we'll talk tomorrow."

59:54.716 --> 59:56.633
Let's see if he sends another...

59:56.759 --> 59:59.636
"We've decided
to reveal our private business."

59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.597
No, we can't...

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:09.021
He wrote "jerk".

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:12.149
- Damn.
- How dare he?

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.402
You'll have to explain this.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.280
- Explain what?
- You don't just call someone a jerk.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:21.283
In fact he's an oaf,
he's bad-mannered.

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:24.369
Would this oaf
happened to be named Lucia?

01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:28.790
- Don't be silly!
- Such a cheeky co-worker.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:33.670
He's calling you.
Answer it, then we'll know more.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.423
We'll find out why he's so angry.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:38.550
Come on.

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:43.263
- Okay, on speaker, right?
- Yes.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.440
- Hello?
- Why do you sound so glum?

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:56.193
I thought you said you had a fever?

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.445
Then why did you go out?

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:01.823
Have you nothing to say?

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:05.077
You're a jerk. You know what?

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.663
You can't make a decision,

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:10.207
you don't know what you want in life.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.794
You don't even know if you like
men or women.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.712
So fuck off!

01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:29.601
This guy's off his rocker...

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:34.231
I would never have thought it. But...

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:44.825
You must be crazy!

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.494
You don't think I'm...

01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:52.124
No, he's a co-worker who's gay...

01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:56.253
and he's obsessed with me, that's all.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:06.513
Stop messing around, okay.
Carlotta?

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:10.392
- Carlotta, no messing around.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:15.647
He's a co-worker...
Rocco, you tell her.

01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:19.609
- Cosimo, come on!
- He's a co-worker who...

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.655
- He's a co-worker.
- You see?

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:26.992
Have you been with him?

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.412
- What?
- Have you been with him? Simple.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:35.125
Have I been with who?
He's a co-worker who's in love with me

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:37.669
and he's convinced
I'm in love with him.

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:40.547
Yes, because fags
think everyone else is a fag.

01:02:40.673 --> 01:02:43.675
- An elegant analysis.
- Sorry, it came out all wrong, but...

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:46.553
The concept is the same.

01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:49.306
- What are you talking about?
- Rocco's right, sort of.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:53.310
I want to know if you've been
with this Lucio. Yes or no?

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:57.439
Carlotta... Geez!
Come on!

01:02:57.648 --> 01:03:02.319
We've been together for 10 years.
We have two wonderful children.

01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:05.322
- You should know me.
- Maybe not well enough.

01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:08.700
What do you mean?
Say something to her!

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.916
Carlotta, look at me.
Darling, look at me.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:21.463
Can you imagine me with a man?
Like this, eyes straight ahead?

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:24.341
Can you imagine me like that?
Can you?

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:30.472
Though there's no harm in that.
I'm just saying that...

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.600
because I have other tastes,
and you know that.

01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:35.602
Carlotta...

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.188
I promise you, between me and...

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.607
- Lucio.
- Lucio... nothing's ever happened.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.360
I swear.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.467
It's Lucio.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.887
He says he misses your kisses.

01:04:29.156 --> 01:04:30.991
Is he a fag then?

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:37.539
- Guys, how can I explain...
- There's nothing to explain.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.794
Don't you start now.
What's wrong?

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:48.049
What's wrong? Nothing.
I'm fine. Are you?

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.428
Yes, I'm fine.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:54.639
- Fine then.
- Wait, let him talk.

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:57.809
Talk? He hasn't said anything
for 20 years.

01:04:58.185 --> 01:05:00.645
What was I supposed to tell you?

01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:03.064
What were you supposed
to tell me?

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:06.693
We've been friends since childhood,
tell me who you are.

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:09.821
He's the same person
you've always confided in,

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.324
and shared everything with.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.702
I wouldn't say everything, Peppe.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.955
He omitted a small detail.

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:23.084
And perhaps he should've told me.

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:27.464
I should have told you?

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:32.469
- Why?
- We've slept together.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:36.681
Took a shower together.
I want to know if my best friend's a fag.

01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:40.977
I might decide it's fine by me,
but I want to know, damn it!

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:46.733
"I might decide it's fine by me"?

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:50.612
Do you hear yourself?

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:52.864
Do you realize what you said?

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:56.868
Do you realize
what you didn't say?

01:05:56.994 --> 01:06:00.956
- But what's the problem?
- I'm asking him, I want to know.

01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:03.375
Let me get this straight.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:08.380
Does it bother you that I'm a fag,
or just that I didn't tell you?

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:14.386
- You're going too far, Cosimo.
- Okay...

01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:18.974
If you find it normal,
then it's all in my head.

01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:22.519
Okay? It's all good.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.772
I'm exaggerating.
I was wrong. Forgive me.

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:30.777
No, I'm the one who's wrong.

01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:34.990
I was wrong to think
we were friends.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:41.413
Better not drink from the bottle...

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:43.873
Fuck off, Rocco!

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:54.926
He's not cheating on you
with another woman,

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.929
so he's not questioning
his relationship with you.

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.807
He's questioning himself.

01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:03.810
He told you lies
because it was inevitable,

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:06.563
but you must decide if you want him,

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:10.442
and if you can forgive him or not,
that's the real problem.

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:15.196
The real problem is that
Lucio's missing my husband's kisses.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:30.712
- When did this affair start?
- What affair? This is absurd.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:35.175
Not really. You haven't
touched me in months.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.970
I was sure you had someone else,
maybe a whore like Peppe's.

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:41.473
It would all make sense.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:47.854
- It'd make sense?
- How long has it been going on?

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.981
Lele, how long?

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:52.859
How long has it been going on?

01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:56.071
Not long.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.133
- Can I say something?
- No.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.764
How many?

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.643
- How many what?
- How many before him?

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.520
None.

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:31.856
Lucio's the only one.

01:08:36.153 --> 01:08:37.779
All right...

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:40.156
Thanks for dinner.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:47.412
- Let's go, we'll talk at home.
- In front of the kids?

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:51.167
"Kids, we have something to tell you.
Daddy's a fag!

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:54.671
But don't tell your teacher,
or you'll show daddy up

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.131
when he picks you up from school."

01:08:57.258 --> 01:09:00.676
- Have you finished?
- Why don't you say something?

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.179
They're your friends,
they want to know.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.889
Let's go home.

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:07.267
You go home.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:07.577
It's yours.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.130
Hello, yes?

01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:21.382
Hi, Cosimo, at last!

01:10:21.508 --> 01:10:24.510
You're hard to get a hold of.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.096
Don't you check your messages?

01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:30.141
I've left loads
over the last two weeks.

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:34.229
- I know, Maurizio...
- I've called you a hundred times.

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:39.025
- I know, you're right.
- Just tell me if she liked the ring.

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:43.655
Yes, she liked it.
Sorry, now's not a good time.

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:48.159
Well did she like the earrings?

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:51.537
Sorry, but I really have to go.
I'm tied up. Bye.

01:11:10.307 --> 01:11:12.684
Did who like the earrings?

01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:17.188
- You, they were for you.
- For me?

01:11:17.314 --> 01:11:19.399
- Yes...
- I don't wear earrings.

01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:24.195
- I don't even have pierced ears.
- Well, I got them...

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:27.699
- You're telling lies.
- No, it's not a lie.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:32.412
Have I ever lied to you?
Enough of this game, it's bad for us.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:36.457
- Too many misunderstandings now.
- They were for Ginevra.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.585
Ginevra?
What are you talking about?

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:42.338
Tell me you're not screwing Ginevra.

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.424
Screwing Ginevra?
What do you mean?

01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:47.427
Who were those fucking
earrings for then?

01:11:56.603 --> 01:11:58.354
Answer it.

01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:02.358
- It's Marika, come on.
- Talk to Marika.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:06.237
It's a work thing...

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.615
Bianca, give me that phone.

01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:14.620
Give me that phone.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:17.623
Give me that fucking phone!

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:24.630
Hello, sweetie?
Sorry for calling so late, Cosimo...

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:28.760
I panicked. I did the test
and there are two lines on it.

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:33.639
I think it's positive.
I think I'm pregnant. Am I?

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:36.851
Am I pregnant? I can't tell,
do two lines mean positive?

01:12:36.977 --> 01:12:40.646
Cosimo, can you hear me?
Are you there?

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.524
Can you hear me, sweetie?

01:12:57.664 --> 01:12:59.415
Fuck!

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.632
Bianca!

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.180
Bianca.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.937
Open this door.
Open it, please!

01:13:38.038 --> 01:13:40.081
You're disgusting.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.061
Eva!

01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:24.000
What's wrong?

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:25.877
Nothing.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:30.006
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.027
What the...

01:14:51.111 --> 01:14:53.029
What the fuck!

01:14:54.907 --> 01:15:00.036
We've only just gotten married,
we screw every day, we're happy...

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:02.538
Will you tell me why?

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.501
I don't know.
Bianca, I really don't know.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.547
I didn't even want to get married.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:16.761
I never believed in marriage.
Marriage makes me sad and anxious.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:19.931
I didn't want a child, either.

01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:24.060
What do I know
about bringing kids up?

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.064
I just wanted to be free.

01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:32.944
Then that asshole came along
and turned my life upside-down.

01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:37.573
He made me believe we could
be happy and I trusted him, but...

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:41.702
How the fuck does
Marika fit in with this?

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:48.084
- How the fuck does she fit in?
- Go away!

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.211
- Don't open it.
- Go away!

01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:53.214
Carlotta, it's me, open the door.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.718
Will you open the door?

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:24.579
It doesn't mean anything, you know.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.623
He's just a guy on Facebook.

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:30.585
Look at me!
I don't even know him.

01:16:31.878 --> 01:16:34.755
A guy you don't know asks
if you're wearing panties?

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:38.884
It's a game. But we've never met.
We just write to each other.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.597
- Call him.
- What?

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.015
Call him!

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:47.768
I can't, I've never spoken to him.
He's got a family.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:51.606
- Really? You have a family too.
- Come on...

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.733
- Call him!
- We only write...

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.611
- If it's a game, call him.
- Please, don't call him!

01:16:56.778 --> 01:17:00.781
- What would I say to him?
- Let's see how well you know him.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.161
Play the game.

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:22.637
Hello?
Carlotta, is that you?

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.055
Hi.

01:17:24.264 --> 01:17:27.933
- Sorry, was I wrong to write tonight?
- No, it's okay.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.187
What a surprise!
How come you're calling?

01:17:31.938 --> 01:17:35.024
- I was curious to hear your voice.
- I'm glad you did.

01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:38.694
I'd like to meet up too.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.782
But we agreed not to.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:45.660
Or rather, you didn't want to.

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:48.329
You're right, yes.
I did say that.

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:53.959
If you've changed your mind,
we could meet, I'd like to.

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:56.671
- Sorry, I have to go now.
- Carlotta, wait.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:59.924
- What?
- You've got a nice voice.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:03.052
- It's not how I imagined it.
- Bye.

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.555
You see...

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.851
Are you wearing panties or not?

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.562
Just curious.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:20.111
We're all very curious,
we'd like to know.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.075
- Are you?
- Stop it.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:29.995
- It's an easy question, tell me.
- Please, just stop it.

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:32.957
- Stop it, please!
- Let me see.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:34.750
Stop it!

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:43.008
- I'm going home.
- Tell the kids about this too.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:46.387
Tell them their mother
doesn't wear panties.

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:52.226
All this fuss over panties!
Here you go.

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:54.478
- I'm not wearing any, happy?
- Hey...

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.356
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.776
After what I've heard tonight,
this is nothing.

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:06.115
I'll tell you a secret you won't find
on my phone, or Lele's.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:08.409
- Don't do this.
- Quiet, let me finish.

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:11.036
I was driving that night, not Lele.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:16.292
He took the blame but I was driving.
I was drunk, I'd have ended up in jail.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.045
But what would we have done
with the kids?

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:24.759
We chose...
what is it we always say?

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.427
The lesser of two evils.

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:32.141
But a man died, I wouldn't
call that the "lesser of two evils".

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:40.900
- Okay, that's enough now.
- Enough what, Lele?

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:44.945
You do realize we haven't discussed
it since, like it never happened?

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:48.449
The only thing that's kept us
together was my guilt.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:52.077
The guilt you've made me feel
over the years.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.959
Why haven't we split up?

01:20:05.091 --> 01:20:08.052
People should learn
how to split up.

01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:19.480
If only you'd told me
you were a fag!

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.233
It would've made things easier.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:38.874
Actually, I'm the one who's the fag.

01:20:52.138 --> 01:20:54.139
Fag!

01:20:55.475 --> 01:20:57.226
Did I say it right?

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:03.524
When you say it, you always
articulate it like this... fag!

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.028
You pronounce it with two Fs
and a nice hard G.

01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:10.614
Did I say it right?

01:21:11.491 --> 01:21:13.993
Did I say it right, or not?

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:22.167
- Not such a good idea, was it?
- I'd say not.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:27.506
- Why didn't you tell us before?
- Why didn't I tell you before?

01:21:27.924 --> 01:21:30.426
Because I didn't know before.

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:35.431
- Then when I realized...
- I'll tell you why he didn't tell us.

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:40.436
Because I was a fag for two hours,
and that was long enough.

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:45.024
We're all open-minded here, right?

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:49.153
We all like to have a fag for a friend.

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:52.573
And now we've got one too.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.953
- And it seems we took it very well.
- Fuck off!

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.455
There, you see?

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:04.084
You think they didn't renew
my contract because I'd put weight on?

01:22:04.961 --> 01:22:07.171
- Was it because you're gay?
- Rocco, for God's sake.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.214
Not gay! It doesn't befit you.

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:13.344
Carry on saying "fag"!
It comes more naturally.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.055
Peppe, why don't you sue
the school?

01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:19.600
Sue them?
I can't even tell you I'm gay...

01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:23.938
never mind a court of people,
a judge, the lawyers...

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.483
my relatives...

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:34.990
I liked this game, it was a bit like
the story of the serial killer,

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:38.243
I wanted to be unmasked too.

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.204
But not like this though.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.589
At least you can introduce us
to Lucio now.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.634
I really don't think so, Rocco.

01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:56.637
Because tonight...

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:59.974
you're the ones
who came out, not me.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.270
No...

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.023
I won't introduce you.

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:11.527
Not because
I'm scared of your wisecracks,

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:14.363
I've heard enough of those.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:19.493
But because I know he'd be hurt
at the first weird glance.

01:23:20.036 --> 01:23:23.247
And I don't want him to be hurt,
I want to protect him.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.501
Because if you love someone,
you protect them, from everything.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:30.921
From this...

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.553
and all this.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:24:00.951
Bianca. Come on, open this door.

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:05.205
That's enough, open this door.

01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:09.460
She's locked herself in.

01:24:09.919 --> 01:24:11.420
Bianca!

01:24:14.966 --> 01:24:16.425
Open the door!

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:19.720
- Get her out of there!
- How?

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.930
- Break it down!
- Let's try.

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.435
- Break the door down.
- Bianca!

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:29.980
- Open this door!
- Get out of the way!

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.011
Your mother called.

01:25:01.137 --> 01:25:03.597
I told her you're going to be a father.

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:07.726
She was very happy.
She congratulated me.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:25.119
You're right not to introduce
Lucio to them. Keep him to yourself.

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:51.061
Go on.

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:52.938
Go, go on!

01:27:22.111 --> 01:27:24.029
Look how beautiful it is!

01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:27.366
It's full again.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.618
It's amazing!

01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:35.916
That's enough!
You're always at it!

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:39.169
- Hurry up, darling, it's cold.
- I'm on my way.

01:27:39.295 --> 01:27:40.796
Bye, Peppe.

01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:43.257
- Bye, Lele.
- I'll call you.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:49.179
Are we on for soccer tomorrow?

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:53.267
- I haven't heard from anyone.
- It's probably been called off.

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:56.311
- Call me if there's a game.
- Of course.

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:58.689
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.068
Peppe,
next time we want to meet Lucilla.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:06.280
Okay, as soon as she's feeling better.
Bye, good night.

01:28:07.323 --> 01:28:11.827
- Why didn't you want to play the game?
- I didn't like the idea.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:16.415
No, you insisted on not playing.
Got something to hide?

01:28:19.335 --> 01:28:20.585
No.

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.713
Why then?

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:26.925
Because we're breakable... all of us,

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:29.177
some more than others.

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:41.732
You're right, this has become our
black box, it's got everything inside.

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.317
Perhaps too much.

01:28:44.193 --> 01:28:46.486
And it's wrong
to play around with it.

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:54.369
But I have nothing to hide.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.247
You can do whatever
you want with it.

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:02.377
You can take a look.
There's no passcode.

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:07.341
Nice earrings, are they new?

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:10.010
Yes.

01:29:18.227 --> 01:29:20.103
Marika: Call me, it's urgent!

01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:22.731
Eva: I wanted you so bad tonight...

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:26.109
- Who are you texting?
- Eva and Rocco.

01:29:26.277 --> 01:29:29.029
- To thank them for tonight.
- Good.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:33.158
- We had a good time, right?
- Yes.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:36.036
"That makes two of us"

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:44.795
- It's Marika, what a pain!
- For a shift change, don't answer it.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:47.130
I'm not going to.

01:29:48.007 --> 01:29:50.550
Listen... no more biodynamic wine.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:54.304
I bought six bottles of it.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.181
Figures!
