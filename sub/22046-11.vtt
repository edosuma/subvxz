34:11.849 --> 34:13.818
- Of course. I will apologize.
- She takes offense to it.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.821
{\an1}- And I will apologize profusely
over and over again,

34:16.888 --> 34:19.924
{\an1}because I never meant it
anything more towards Jenn.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.391
- Fine.
- Jenn is an amazing person.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.094
{\an3}- And again,
if it's towards me, it's okay.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.562
I don't give a [bleep],
because you know what?

34:24.629 --> 34:26.164
{\an3}Like,
if it's towards me, great.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.831
{\an1}- I just--okay,
we were talking about Jenn.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.167
{\an1}I thought we were
talking about Jenn.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.635
- We are.
- But there's no other one

34:30.701 --> 34:31.869
{\an1}that could be in a fight
between Jenn and I.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.737
{\an3}- All right.
Fine, so that's fine.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.039
Giving you a heads up.
- Thank you.

34:36.373 --> 34:38.376
<i>- I won't fight with Jenn,</i>

34:38.443 --> 34:39.944
'cause I don't want
to fight with Jenn.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.612
I never did want
to fight with Jenn.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.315
There's not
gonna be a situation, Peter.

34:44.382 --> 34:45.917
I'm sorry to break it to you.

34:45.983 --> 34:49.253
- I already spoke to Anna.
- Are you [bleep] kidding me?

34:49.320 --> 34:51.222
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

34:51.289 --> 34:52.523
- Please.
- No, no.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.958
- What do you mean no?
You said--

34:54.025 --> 34:55.259
- No.
- Honestly, Jenn,

34:55.326 --> 34:56.893
the whole entire thing--
- I'm curious.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.863
{\an1}I'm curious, since you
[bleep] talked to her first,

34:58.930 --> 35:00.398
{\an1}I'm very curious
as to what you said to her.

35:00.465 --> 35:03.534
{\an3}- He said it was gonna be
a fight between us.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.002
- Seriously?

35:05.069 --> 35:08.005
{\an1}Says the guy who [bleep]
cause fights

35:08.072 --> 35:09.807
because I'm [bleep]
friends with them.

35:09.874 --> 35:12.143
{\an1}Are you serious, but you [bleep]
talk to her first,

35:12.210 --> 35:14.645
{\an1}when I told you I could [bleep]
handle my [bleep] myself.

35:14.712 --> 35:16.647
- I did. I did.
- Are you [bleep] kidding me?

35:16.714 --> 35:18.382
- I did say that, Jenn.
- But they wanna [bleep]

35:18.449 --> 35:20.551
disrespect me when they don't
[bleep] know

35:20.618 --> 35:22.920
what I've been through.
Are you serious?

35:24.589 --> 35:26.557
{\an8}- No, [bleep] you.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.125
{\an1}But you can [bleep]
get mad at me

35:28.192 --> 35:30.461
{\an1}for being [bleep] friends
with them!

35:30.528 --> 35:33.698
[crying]

35:33.764 --> 35:35.867
No, it's so [bleep] stupid.

35:35.933 --> 35:38.336
You're gonna [bleep]
seriously calm her down

35:38.402 --> 35:39.737
before I'm about to flip out,

35:39.804 --> 35:41.405
{\an1}because they [bleep]
disrespected me!

35:41.472 --> 35:45.409
- I'm looking out for you.
- Peter is so happy right now.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.311
This is exactly what he wants.

35:47.378 --> 35:50.781
He's looking for any excuse
for Jenn and I

35:50.848 --> 35:52.550
not to get along so
she doesn't have

35:52.617 --> 35:54.051
<i>to interact with me.</i>

35:54.118 --> 35:56.888
- [crying]

35:59.590 --> 36:01.592
{\an1}- Cool yourself off.
Let her calm down.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.160
She's gonna cry.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.563
- I just want to put it
out there, Jenn, you're awesome.

36:05.630 --> 36:06.831
{\an1}I've told you
from the beginning,

36:06.898 --> 36:08.199
{\an1}you sat there that night
and talked to me,

36:08.266 --> 36:09.634
and I sat there--
- I know, but--

36:09.700 --> 36:10.835
- No, let me, let me,
let me finish, okay?

36:10.902 --> 36:13.004
{\an1}When--
Peter, do not interrupt me.

36:13.070 --> 36:15.006
{\an1}When you were yelling
at her that night

36:15.072 --> 36:17.575
{\an1}for whatever she did wrong,
like, I'm sorry.

36:17.642 --> 36:19.277
{\an1}We sat there
and talked so highly

36:19.343 --> 36:21.913
{\an1}about y'all's relationship.
Did we not, Jenn?

36:21.979 --> 36:23.447
- I--I told him that.
- I know.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.782
- I told him that.
- And then you're gonna sit--

36:24.849 --> 36:26.384
and yell at her?
- I don't care.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.185
- You don't care.
You don't care about anything

36:28.252 --> 36:30.388
besides your [bleep] self.
You're ignorant.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.323
Everyone will see that.
You're manipulative.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.091
This girl's [bleep] great.
- You're malicious.

36:34.158 --> 36:35.626
- Okay, you know what, Peter?
- You're malicious.

36:35.693 --> 36:36.761
- I don't--
- You're malicious.

36:36.827 --> 36:38.095
{\an1}- See, the problem is
the fact that,

36:38.162 --> 36:39.664
{\an1}no one [bleep] knows
what I've been through.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.198
I've been through
an abusive relationship.

36:41.265 --> 36:43.234
So just because he's raising
his [bleep] voice,

36:43.301 --> 36:45.836
and when he's angry, it doesn't
mean he's verbally abusing me.

36:45.903 --> 36:48.105
I know what it feels like
to be verbally abused.

36:48.172 --> 36:50.441
When I'm told that I'm [bleep]
a piece of [bleep],

36:50.508 --> 36:52.443
that's when I'm being
verbally abused,

36:52.510 --> 36:53.878
not just [bleep] getting mad

36:53.945 --> 36:55.413
'cause I'm hanging out
with you two!

36:55.479 --> 36:57.014
So seriously,
don't [bleep] sit here

36:57.081 --> 36:58.416
and Google what fucking
verbal abuse is!

36:58.482 --> 37:00.751
{\an1}- Try to turn this around.
I didn't look it up.

37:00.818 --> 37:02.286
I didn't look it up.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.055
- I know, but it's your
[bleep] sister, though!

37:04.121 --> 37:06.190
Are you serious?
It's your [bleep] sister!

37:06.257 --> 37:10.094
{\an8}When your [bleep] sister is
drunk, she's a [bleep] bitch!

37:14.699 --> 37:16.334
{\an7}- Every single girl here
agreed with me

37:16.400 --> 37:18.536
{\an7}that [bleep] night
when Peter was yelling at her.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.838
{\an1}For y'all not to sit up there
and say they did not agree.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.907
[overlapping voices]

37:22.974 --> 37:24.008
- Say it. Say it.
Say it. No, say it. Say it.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.242
Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.411
{\an1}- No, every girl--
for you to yell at her--

37:27.478 --> 37:28.946
{\an1}Everyone in the house
was woken up, and they're like--

37:29.013 --> 37:30.348
- Okay, no, no, no.
No, no, no. [bleep]

37:30.414 --> 37:31.816
Everybody else was up.
Everybody else was up.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.517
- [crying]
- So, let's be clear.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.820
<i>- Peter's out of control.</i>
<i>He's disrespectful.</i>

37:35.886 --> 37:37.855
{\an8}When a man can sit there
and raise his voice,

37:37.922 --> 37:39.490
<i>and everyone can sit there</i>
<i>and be in shock</i>

37:39.557 --> 37:41.592
and not say anything,
I will say something.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.094
You are not a man.
- Don't tell me I'm not a man!

37:43.160 --> 37:44.862
- No, you--
- You're the--No, no!

37:44.929 --> 37:46.831
{\an3}I'm not gonna let you finish!
You're gonna disrespect me 100%.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.666
Think I'm gonna let you finish?
- You know, I don't like you.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.434
- I don't like you either!
You're disrespectful too, honey.

37:50.501 --> 37:52.203
- ...in the house,
'cause you [bleep] [bleep].

37:52.269 --> 37:54.238
{\an1}- White trash Florida.
I know what Florida's like.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.673
- Oh, yeah?
- White trash.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.108
{\an1}Southwest Florida.
I get it. I lived there.

37:57.174 --> 37:59.577
I get it.
- Uh-huh. Exactly, Peter.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.145
- I don't give a [bleep].
- 'Cause you're a [bleep], yo.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.413
{\an1}- You calling security again,
Katrina?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.849
{\an1}Security, domestic violence,
please come by.

38:04.915 --> 38:08.285
- Please.
- [sobbing]

38:08.352 --> 38:11.622
- It's funny, 'cause Anna is
nowhere to be found right now.

38:11.689 --> 38:14.058
{\an3}- Seriously, for you to look up
this whole [bleep] thing

38:14.125 --> 38:17.328
{\an3}on the computer here
starts this whole drama.

38:17.395 --> 38:20.131
I feel like Jenn
is just using this

38:20.197 --> 38:23.200
as like a cop-out
to not talk to me,

38:23.267 --> 38:25.569
'cause it makes things easier
for her and Peter.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.371
<i>But these are red flags.</i>

38:27.438 --> 38:29.073
And I guarantee you,

38:29.140 --> 38:30.274
if anybody else
looks that [bleep] up, too,

38:30.341 --> 38:31.942
you'll see the same exact thing,

38:32.009 --> 38:34.679
what she's been going through.

38:34.745 --> 38:36.113
- I told you I have your back.

38:36.180 --> 38:38.015
- They have no [bleep]
right to [bleep] butt in

38:38.082 --> 38:39.650
my [bleep] relationship,
'cause obviously they feel

38:39.717 --> 38:41.585
some type of way because
he was with Anna at first.

38:41.652 --> 38:44.622
Like, of course they're gonna
[bleep] feel some type of way.

38:44.689 --> 38:48.726
{\an8}- Definitely my heart feels
for Jenn, because Peter,

38:48.793 --> 38:50.995
{\an8}he manipulates the hell
out of her.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.432
<i>The way he, speaks to her,</i>
<i>and just overall,</i>

38:54.498 --> 38:56.801
<i>making her feel bad</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

38:56.867 --> 38:58.302
<i>So I feel for her,</i>
<i>but I mean,</i>

38:58.369 --> 39:00.304
I'm not gonna be able
to let her see that.

39:00.371 --> 39:01.972
She's gonna have
to see it on her own.

39:02.039 --> 39:03.240
- You just have to have
your relationship,

39:03.307 --> 39:04.875
and only you know
your relationship.

39:04.942 --> 39:07.378
That's it. No one can put
their two cents in about it.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.180
- Jenn, when I sat there
and saw you,

39:09.246 --> 39:11.115
like, crying and upset,
it hurt me,

39:11.182 --> 39:13.284
'cause I know how much you care
about Peter, you know?

39:13.350 --> 39:17.021
Ugh, this whole situation
tonight that went down--

39:17.088 --> 39:18.823
{\an1}- It's very unfortunate
that, like,

39:18.889 --> 39:20.391
{\an1}I have to have this
conversation with you,

39:20.458 --> 39:22.493
{\an1}because it's not you.
It's your sister.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.829
{\an1}And that's what's
so frustrating.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.197
Because it's even
more frustrating,

39:26.263 --> 39:27.932
{\an1}'cause they had a thing
in the beginning,

39:27.998 --> 39:29.266
{\an1}so now it just makes it
seem like

39:29.333 --> 39:31.168
{\an1}she's doing it on purpose
and the fact that

39:31.235 --> 39:33.671
{\an1}she can Google that [bleep]
and leave it up there

39:33.738 --> 39:36.674
{\an1}for the entire house to see,
that's so disrespectful.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.309
- Listen. Listen,
- Because if there's one thing

39:38.375 --> 39:41.145
{\an1}that can push my buttons,
it's that

39:41.212 --> 39:42.913
{\an1}because that [bleep]
destroyed me,

39:42.980 --> 39:44.749
{\an1}and that's why
I don't have confidence,

39:44.815 --> 39:46.584
and that's why I hate myself

39:46.650 --> 39:48.519
and just the fact that
she can't come out here

39:48.586 --> 39:51.122
{\an1}and apologize to me
is [bleep] bull[bleep].

39:51.188 --> 39:52.556
- Jenn.
- It's [bleep] bull[bleep]

39:52.623 --> 39:54.759
because I gave you guys
the benefit of the doubt.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.026
{\an1}Peter was pissed at me
that night,

39:56.093 --> 39:57.795
{\an1}and the reason
why he was yelling at me is

39:57.862 --> 40:00.931
because he can't stand you two.
That's why he was yelling at me.

40:02.466 --> 40:05.002
{\an3}- No, Jenn, I understand
and I apologize.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.905
{\an1}- I've kept my mouth
shut this entire time,

40:07.972 --> 40:09.874
{\an1}between her calling
Peter a bitch last night,

40:09.940 --> 40:11.976
{\an1}between whatever
you guys have with Peter.

40:12.042 --> 40:13.377
{\an1}Like,
it's so [bleep] annoying,

40:13.444 --> 40:16.180
{\an1}but now, your sister
disrespected me,

40:16.247 --> 40:19.917
so now I'm [bleep] pissed.
