00:28.141 --> 00:30.538
Oh, Jesus!

00:30.540 --> 00:32.539
Ugh!

00:46.639 --> 00:48.605
John, it's me!

00:48.607 --> 00:51.472
This is bullshit, motherfucker!

00:51.474 --> 00:53.504
John, come on!
Answer the door!

00:53.506 --> 00:55.137
I've got your box.

01:06.573 --> 01:08.440
Oh my God!

01:10.840 --> 01:13.039
Wow! Smells great in here!

01:14.705 --> 01:17.605
Jeez! When was the last time
you opened a window?

01:21.673 --> 01:24.538
John, where are you?
I don't have a lot of time.

01:26.606 --> 01:28.471
It's dark in here.

01:35.506 --> 01:39.406
Did you ask for the
place that Sid Vicious died in?

01:40.906 --> 01:42.638
John?

01:45.873 --> 01:47.671
John, are you even here?

02:05.774 --> 02:08.037
- What did the letter say?
- Honey, I don't know.

02:08.038 --> 02:10.571
What do you mean,
you don't know?

02:10.573 --> 02:13.437
You said you returned it
to the front desk.

02:13.439 --> 02:16.370
- I didn't say I didn't know.
- You just did.

02:16.372 --> 02:18.137
You said:
"Honey, I don't know."

02:18.139 --> 02:19.938
Rupert, the letter
wasn't for you.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.603
It was the front desk's mistake.

02:21.605 --> 02:23.936
And sending it back down
without showing it to me

02:23.938 --> 02:25.036
was just irrepressible?

02:25.038 --> 02:26.937
Rupert, enough!

02:30.407 --> 02:33.069
Mom, it's the first chance
I get to meet him

02:33.071 --> 02:34.570
after all those years.

02:34.572 --> 02:38.002
Honey, I know,
but you have a big day.

02:38.004 --> 02:39.770
- You opened the letter.
- Yes.

02:39.772 --> 02:41.970
Then you realized
it wasn't for me...

02:41.972 --> 02:43.603
Yes, and I
already apologized.

02:43.605 --> 02:45.904
- ...and just sent it back down?
- Yes.

02:45.906 --> 02:48.603
Well, the front desk
couldn't have sent up

02:48.605 --> 02:49.838
a letter that wasn't for me

02:49.840 --> 02:51.637
if they didn't have
a letter that was

02:51.639 --> 02:53.104
in the first place.

02:53.106 --> 02:56.069
It's pretty clear they sent
my letter to the wrong person.

02:56.071 --> 02:58.570
So there's a letter waiting
for me at the hotel.

02:58.572 --> 03:01.772
Yes. Yes, probably.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.870
All right, get yourself
something else to eat...

03:07.039 --> 03:08.669
...whatever you want,

03:08.671 --> 03:11.537
and I will call them right away.

03:13.138 --> 03:15.104
Look, we will go to the hotel,

03:15.106 --> 03:18.571
and I'm sure there'll be
a letter waiting for you,

03:18.573 --> 03:21.405
and you'll probably meet
later this afternoon.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.504
Was it written in green ink?

03:26.506 --> 03:28.902
What?

03:28.904 --> 03:31.604
Was it written in green ink?

03:35.704 --> 03:37.670
I... I don't remember.

03:42.571 --> 03:46.003
Honey, everything's
gonna be all right, OK?

04:09.972 --> 04:12.469
<i>We have shocking breaking news</i>

04:12.471 --> 04:13.736
<i>just now at 2:31.</i>

04:13.738 --> 04:17.970
<i>We have word that TV idol
John Francis Donovan has died</i>

04:17.971 --> 04:19.137
<i>at the age of 29.</i>

04:19.139 --> 04:21.067
<i>The actor gained prominence</i>

04:21.070 --> 04:23.570
<i>in the American
television industry,</i>

04:23.572 --> 04:26.770
<i>first as</i> Hellsome High's
<i>Adam White on the WV...</i>

04:48.670 --> 04:52.670
<i>The thing I've
forgotten to work on is myself.</i>

04:57.671 --> 05:00.136
This is ridiculous!

05:05.371 --> 05:07.869
No reception.
What fucking year is this?

05:21.437 --> 05:23.935
Oh, fuck's sake!

05:34.371 --> 05:36.567
Hal, it's me.
You can't do this.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.534
I'm on a flight to London
at 2:30.

05:39.536 --> 05:42.901
Well, my appointment in Paris
got pushed, didn't it?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.768
I got your email this morning,

05:45.770 --> 05:48.934
and I couldn't respond
because my router's screwed, OK?

05:48.936 --> 05:50.601
Just listen to me.

05:50.603 --> 05:52.769
So, I've come here
to greet him in person,

05:52.771 --> 05:54.868
because I'm a civilized woman,
all right?

05:54.870 --> 05:57.736
But I'm not writing the piece.
You can't make me do it.

05:58.738 --> 06:00.101
I don't care!

06:00.103 --> 06:02.868
Just hire another journalist,
postpone the interview.

06:02.870 --> 06:05.535
Robert fucking Turner's
not going anywhere, is he?

06:05.537 --> 06:07.900
I don't give a shit
about getting his name right,

06:07.902 --> 06:09.836
because I'm not doing it.

06:11.870 --> 06:14.570
I haven't even read
his stupid book.

06:14.572 --> 06:18.134
How am I supposed to conduct
an interview with someone

06:18.136 --> 06:19.668
if I haven't read...

06:19.670 --> 06:22.735
What, and I'm gonna write
about some actor du jour

06:22.737 --> 06:26.668
who's unearthed whatever story
because he's craving momentum?

06:26.670 --> 06:28.603
I've got standards, you know?

06:34.537 --> 06:36.469
Fine! OK?

06:36.471 --> 06:38.767
Yep, I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

06:38.769 --> 06:41.533
I'll do it.
Mm-hmm, one hour.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.968
And if that little squirt
gives me one iota of sass,

06:44.970 --> 06:46.769
I swear to God...

06:48.936 --> 06:50.934
Yep! Fine, Hal!

06:50.936 --> 06:52.568
Bye! Goodbye!

06:56.671 --> 06:59.102
Can you believe they still
use these old pay phones

06:59.104 --> 07:00.768
here in 2017?

07:02.770 --> 07:06.068
I can see a coherence with
the rest of Eastern Europe.

07:06.070 --> 07:08.102
Production pays
for some shitty mobile

07:08.104 --> 07:09.534
while we're shooting here,

07:09.536 --> 07:10.767
but it keeps shutting down.

07:10.769 --> 07:12.602
I'll just, uh,
just use the phone.

07:12.604 --> 07:15.700
I'll be with you in a minute
so we can start the interview.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.699
I'm so excited.

07:17.701 --> 07:19.900
I'll just, uh,
just be in there...

07:19.902 --> 07:21.501
OK!

07:21.503 --> 07:23.402
...while you
make your call.

08:01.101 --> 08:04.899
September 2017,
"Turner publishes memoir

08:04.901 --> 08:07.766
"composed of his entire
correspondence with Donovan.

08:07.768 --> 08:09.934
"Donovan died of an overdose."

08:51.668 --> 08:52.766
Hmm!

08:52.768 --> 08:54.735
No, please don't rush.
Take your time.

08:54.737 --> 08:56.734
My, do they feed you
at <i>The Times?</i>

08:56.736 --> 08:59.499
Asking out of sheer
curiosity, really.

08:59.501 --> 09:01.032
Please don't think me sassy.

09:01.034 --> 09:04.533
"The sassy actor stormed into
the Art Nouveau decorated cafÃ©,

09:04.535 --> 09:07.433
"his hair disheveled,
sporting a faded army jacket."

09:07.435 --> 09:09.399
I'm feeling this!

09:09.401 --> 09:12.367
I forgot they allowed
you to smoke in here.

09:12.369 --> 09:15.100
Oh, but just for a few
more months, unfortunately.

09:15.102 --> 09:17.466
So, what did you
think of the book?

09:18.869 --> 09:21.766
As you're well aware,
I haven't read your book,

09:21.768 --> 09:24.467
as I wasn't supposed to be
conducting this interview.

09:24.469 --> 09:26.365
As we're both here now,
let's get started

09:26.367 --> 09:27.932
so that maybe
I can catch my flight.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.500
When they emailed me
yesterday afternoon that

09:30.502 --> 09:31.734
it'd be you
doing the piece,

09:31.736 --> 09:33.032
I read some of
your articles.

09:33.034 --> 09:34.467
Yesterday afternoon?

09:34.469 --> 09:35.632
You're quite versatile

09:35.634 --> 09:36.866
for a political reporter.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.368
You contributed to this

09:38.370 --> 09:40.400
environmental-
apocalypse piece I read.

09:40.402 --> 09:42.666
The one about the, uh,
what is it? West Coast...

09:42.668 --> 09:44.699
- The Juan de Fuca subduction zone.
- Yeah!

09:44.701 --> 09:47.631
A 9.2 magnitude earthquake
will ravage the West Coast?

09:47.633 --> 09:49.766
When is this supposed to
be happening, already?

09:49.768 --> 09:51.467
We're half a
century late for it.

09:51.469 --> 09:52.967
Could be now,
could be 10-20 years,

09:52.969 --> 09:55.799
by which time we still wouldn't
have started this interview.

09:55.801 --> 09:58.000
Oh, you're not recording?

10:09.569 --> 10:11.132
And you want anything?

10:11.134 --> 10:12.800
Double espresso, please.

10:19.469 --> 10:21.498
She spoke in
foreign tongues,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.933
and from then on,
he was enslaved.

10:23.935 --> 10:25.731
Oh, I was anxious
you'd never get

10:25.733 --> 10:27.065
to the use of
the 3rd person.

10:27.067 --> 10:29.598
Now, I'd very much like it
if we could begin now

10:29.600 --> 10:31.398
so that I can maybe
catch my flight.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.799
Uh-huh, well,
if you miss it,

10:32.801 --> 10:35.400
I'm pretty sure that thing
can fly you to London.

10:37.135 --> 10:41.068
Do you want me to write
this piece or not, Mr. Turner?

10:47.367 --> 10:49.466
Yeah? Good.

10:53.434 --> 10:55.431
I think everyone
remembers the scandal,

10:55.433 --> 10:57.966
how the letters were revealed,
et cetera, et cetera...

10:57.968 --> 10:59.965
Why don't you back up
all the way

10:59.967 --> 11:03.033
to how things started
with you and John F. Donovan?

11:05.467 --> 11:07.098
Well, we know
how they started.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.364
He answered one of
your fan letters.

11:09.366 --> 11:10.531
Yeah.

11:10.533 --> 11:12.832
And then an unlikely
correspondence began.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.666
- Mm-hmm.
- That's the fairy tale.

11:14.668 --> 11:16.666
Why don't you rewind to...

11:16.668 --> 11:18.867
When the fairy
tale ended?

11:20.401 --> 11:21.665
If you like.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.631
The year would be 2006.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.998
I had turned 11
that summer.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.364
I, uh...

11:27.366 --> 11:29.764
No, I can still smell
the gas-like odor

11:29.766 --> 11:31.666
of the felt-tip pen he used.

11:33.633 --> 11:34.933
I can still hear the pen

11:34.935 --> 11:36.898
scratching on
the sheets of paper.

11:36.900 --> 11:40.366
We'd always handwrite every
letter, never typed or emailed.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.797
For John, things started
to go wrong

11:42.799 --> 11:45.398
when they were starting
to be great.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.397
Everybody was starting
to pay attention

11:47.399 --> 11:48.797
to the new kid on the block,

11:48.799 --> 11:52.099
saying that he was about
to become the next big deal.

11:52.101 --> 11:55.932
But to us, who had been
following him since day one,

11:55.934 --> 11:59.466
it was very clear
that he already was.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.931
He really was.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.930
Yes! Yes!

13:08.466 --> 13:09.763
Great, John!
We got it.

13:09.765 --> 13:11.131
Thanks!

13:11.133 --> 13:14.098
No, just send me a synopsis
of this conversation.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.464
You were great, hon.

13:15.466 --> 13:17.398
We'll get photo
approval, right, Barb?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.631
Yeah, and you're gettin'
a pony for Christmas.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.664
What does that mean?

13:20.666 --> 13:21.764
It's <i>Vanity Fair,</i> John!

13:21.766 --> 13:24.663
Pretend it's wonderful and
stop being such a big bitch.

13:24.665 --> 13:26.396
- Rhonda!
- Yes, darling! I'm here!

13:26.398 --> 13:27.563
Hay stacks were genius.

13:27.565 --> 13:29.063
- Thanks, doll!
- Thank you, Barbara.

13:29.065 --> 13:30.597
Why'd they make me so oily?

13:30.599 --> 13:31.963
Trust me, it's working.

13:31.965 --> 13:34.063
That whole slutty
mineworker look is huge

13:34.065 --> 13:35.464
in the Midwest.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.564
So, Prada shipped the
suit to the office,

13:37.566 --> 13:39.097
and Mel delivered it
to your place.

13:39.099 --> 13:42.131
Miuccia says "break a leg"
and then some Italian shit

13:42.133 --> 13:43.630
that I didn't understand.

13:44.965 --> 13:47.863
John! The season finale
was dope, man!

13:47.865 --> 13:49.663
The hidden cameras,
that was the shit!

13:49.665 --> 13:51.796
Thanks, man.
That's sweet of you.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.731
Is it true you're
playing Jack Harvest?

13:53.733 --> 13:55.463
He's my favorite
superhero ever!

13:55.465 --> 13:57.730
Fingers crossed,
but I don't know for sure.

13:59.066 --> 14:00.664
John, I love you so much!

14:03.631 --> 14:05.063
She thinks
you're so cute.

14:05.065 --> 14:07.495
John! John!

14:07.497 --> 14:08.996
Sorry, that's all for today.

14:08.998 --> 14:09.997
I love you!

14:13.499 --> 14:15.563
<i>I'm having lunch
with Chris next week.</i>

14:15.565 --> 14:18.031
<i>He knows you're George's choice
for Jack Harvest.</i>

14:18.033 --> 14:19.663
<i>It's looking good, hon!</i>

14:33.798 --> 14:36.530
It's not just
about me, John.

14:36.532 --> 14:39.864
It would've meant the world
to Larry if you'd been there.

14:39.866 --> 14:41.863
- You owe him.
- I was out of town!

14:41.865 --> 14:45.497
- As grateful as I am to Larry, I can't clone myself.
- Thank God!

14:45.499 --> 14:48.496
If you could, you'd never take
your dick out of your own mouth.

14:48.498 --> 14:50.128
Thank you for that image.

14:50.130 --> 14:53.063
Don't pretend like you haven't
thought about it before.

15:26.797 --> 15:29.695
John, tonight's the season
premier of <i>Hellsome High,</i>

15:29.697 --> 15:31.429
Any hint on whether
Adam's parents

15:31.431 --> 15:33.129
will accept him
for who he is?

15:33.131 --> 15:34.763
I can't spoil it
for everyone.

15:34.765 --> 15:37.962
Amy, you are glowing
with <i>fuego!</i> Who?

15:37.964 --> 15:39.463
Giambattista Valli.

15:39.465 --> 15:41.730
- Ooh, is that vintage?
- It is now!

15:44.597 --> 15:47.663
I'm the luckiest
guy in the world.

15:51.431 --> 15:53.496
<i>Rupert!</i>

15:55.097 --> 15:56.096
Rupert?

15:57.531 --> 15:59.029
- Rupert!
- Sorry.

15:59.031 --> 16:02.628
I'm looking forward to reading
your notes from today's class.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.596
I'm assuming it'll
be comprehensive.

16:04.598 --> 16:06.695
He was "gaydreaming" again!

16:06.697 --> 16:09.029
Your preoccupation with
your classmates' sexuality

16:09.031 --> 16:11.495
is becoming
alarmingly obsessive!

16:12.498 --> 16:13.295
Stop laughing!

16:13.297 --> 16:15.130
You must include
3 enumerations

16:15.132 --> 16:18.828
and 4 figures of speech from the
list I provided last Tuesday.

16:18.830 --> 16:19.828
And may I...

16:22.564 --> 16:26.029
Everybody, I'd like to
remind you that next week,

16:26.031 --> 16:28.962
your presentations
are due on Monday.

16:28.964 --> 16:31.361
And don't forget,
the object you bring in

16:31.363 --> 16:34.962
must have emotional significance
to you in real life.

16:34.964 --> 16:38.563
Don't tell me about
your weekend at Hogwarts!

16:42.832 --> 16:46.560
<i>School had
always been a refuge as a kid.</i>

16:46.562 --> 16:47.727
<i>But I got older</i>

16:47.729 --> 16:50.661
<i>and was introduced
to the meanness of guys.</i>

16:50.663 --> 16:51.862
<i>Well, boys.</i>

16:51.864 --> 16:55.561
<i>To survive the jungle,
you had to become an animal.</i>

16:55.563 --> 16:57.395
<i>But for me, it was easier</i>

16:57.397 --> 16:59.695
<i>to just sink into
my own head and TV.</i>

16:59.697 --> 17:00.961
<i>Hmm!</i>

17:00.963 --> 17:04.428
<i>Another occidental tale of
survival from bullying. Bingo!</i>

17:04.430 --> 17:07.627
<i>Well, no, but for years,
all I cared about was John</i>

17:07.628 --> 17:09.828
<i>and that TV show
in which he starred,</i>

17:09.829 --> 17:12.961
and around which my whole world
revolved back then.

17:12.963 --> 17:17.127
Have you ever confided this
obsession in anyone else before?

17:17.128 --> 17:20.994
Uh, what sort of interlocutor
are we talking about here?

17:20.997 --> 17:22.894
I don't know,
professional?

17:22.896 --> 17:25.396
I haven't seen...
What's the name of the show?

17:25.397 --> 17:27.363
Anyway, just carry on.

17:28.862 --> 17:30.461
What's your name again?

17:30.463 --> 17:31.661
Sorry?

17:31.663 --> 17:33.628
I, uh, I can't
remember your name.

17:38.563 --> 17:40.795
Audrey.
Audrey Newhouse.

17:40.797 --> 17:42.929
Yes. Yes, sorry.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.397
Uh, that's...

17:45.697 --> 17:47.761
just not a common
name, Audrey.

17:49.097 --> 17:52.462
You seem to think I'm here
to talk about some icon

17:52.464 --> 17:54.495
or an extremely
honorable body of work

17:54.497 --> 17:57.527
or to promote some
cultural happening.

17:57.529 --> 18:00.560
But I came here thinking
we'd talk about influence

18:00.562 --> 18:02.028
and identity and,
you know, TV.

18:02.030 --> 18:04.961
So, if you're looking
for contrived notions

18:04.963 --> 18:07.593
and dumb quotes on
the biz to mock me,

18:07.595 --> 18:09.128
you'll be disappointed.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.360
This isn't about business, OK?
This is not about art.

18:12.362 --> 18:14.928
This... this is about a man
saving a child's life.

18:14.930 --> 18:18.128
So, I don't care that
John was untalented.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.562
I don't care that what
he did was ridiculous

18:20.564 --> 18:21.961
or that what
he did was shit.

18:21.963 --> 18:24.894
I don't care that his story,
in this time and age,

18:24.896 --> 18:26.095
sounds abysmal to you.

18:26.097 --> 18:29.029
I know I'm not
rebuilding Aleppo, OK?

18:30.362 --> 18:31.926
We're on the same boat.

18:34.529 --> 18:36.893
And that coffee's
decaf, Audrey.

18:41.929 --> 18:43.628
OK, moving on.

18:47.363 --> 18:51.361
<i>Honey, I couldn't watch
you suffer anymore.</i>

18:52.795 --> 18:54.493
<i>I had to understand.</i>

18:54.495 --> 18:55.728
<i>Mom, I'm 17.</i>

18:56.928 --> 18:59.059
Or 30.

18:59.061 --> 19:01.794
<i>Adam, just tell me
none of it was true.</i>

19:03.063 --> 19:04.627
<i>None of it was true...</i>

19:04.629 --> 19:05.961
- What did I miss?
- Calm down!

19:05.963 --> 19:08.493
I don't wanna miss
any more lines!

19:08.495 --> 19:10.727
Shoes on the carpet!
OK, the mother knows.

19:10.729 --> 19:13.426
She saw him using his
hidden powers. She taped him.

19:13.428 --> 19:14.659
You could say hi.

19:14.661 --> 19:17.827
What? Hi!
Mrs. White knows?

19:17.829 --> 19:21.693
Of course! The hidden
cameras in the season finale!

19:21.695 --> 19:22.660
<i>Aaah!</i>

19:22.662 --> 19:25.094
Oh my God!
Did you see what he just did?

19:25.096 --> 19:27.059
He used his powers
in front of her!

19:27.061 --> 19:29.960
Look! Look at the keys!
Look at the keys!

19:29.962 --> 19:31.826
The CGI is amazing!
Look at that!

19:31.828 --> 19:34.460
Rupert, you have a package.
I think it's a poster.

19:34.462 --> 19:35.494
I left it on your bed.

19:35.496 --> 19:36.694
OK!

19:36.696 --> 19:40.126
<i>Honey, what are you?</i>

19:40.128 --> 19:43.393
<i>It's just like you said, Mom.</i>

19:43.395 --> 19:44.694
<i>I'm different.</i>

19:44.696 --> 19:47.627
The opening credits
are coming! They're here!

19:49.829 --> 19:51.426
Oh my God!

19:51.428 --> 19:53.661
That's a new power!
That is a new power!

19:53.663 --> 19:56.493
Oh my God, this is amazing!
This is freaking amazing!

19:56.495 --> 19:57.927
Rupert, voice!

19:57.929 --> 19:59.726
Keep it down.
The neighbors.

19:59.728 --> 20:02.426
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Holy cow!

20:02.428 --> 20:03.427
Shhh!

20:03.429 --> 20:04.661
I'm so happy right now!

20:04.663 --> 20:06.960
Mom, are you even
paying attention?

20:06.962 --> 20:08.993
Come on, this is
<i>Hellsome High!</i>

20:08.995 --> 20:13.460
I was born for this moment!
I came out of you just for this!

20:13.462 --> 20:15.026
Keep it down.

20:15.028 --> 20:16.860
- YES!
- Keep it down.

20:19.628 --> 20:21.793
Yes! This is great!

20:23.794 --> 20:26.493
That's the best power!

20:26.495 --> 20:29.459
Thank you, God!
Thank you for <i>Hellsome High!</i>

20:29.461 --> 20:33.393
Thank you!
I was born for this!

20:33.395 --> 20:36.759
I've been waiting for
this moment all my life!

20:36.761 --> 20:38.926
<i>My father had left
when I was 2,</i>

20:38.928 --> 20:41.827
<i>and since then, it had always
been my mom and me.</i>

20:43.695 --> 20:45.559
<i>Leaving America had sort of</i>

20:45.561 --> 20:48.393
<i>precipitated an unabashed
coming of age.</i>

20:48.395 --> 20:51.560
<i>My mom and I,
we were barely speaking anymore.</i>

20:51.562 --> 20:53.459
<i>Now that we had moved,</i>

20:53.461 --> 20:56.359
<i>I was basically spending
all of my time in my room.</i>

20:56.361 --> 20:58.426
<i>The kids at school
were mocking me</i>

20:58.428 --> 21:01.726
<i>for either being the new guy,
the child actor and...</i>

21:01.728 --> 21:03.626
Yes!

21:03.628 --> 21:06.861
<i>...in my own perspective,
all my dreams had disappeared.</i>

21:09.527 --> 21:11.726
<i>The only one that
had survived was...</i>

21:13.761 --> 21:15.393
<i>John.</i>

21:15.395 --> 21:17.393
I'm not gonna lie to you.

21:17.395 --> 21:18.759
It's been hard, of course.

21:18.761 --> 21:21.727
He doesn't have a British accent
or the energy at all.

21:21.729 --> 21:23.559
So we gotta look for projects

21:23.561 --> 21:25.725
trying to cast
an American kid living here

21:25.727 --> 21:28.393
or other very specific roles.

21:28.395 --> 21:33.059
And I won't pretend it's made
the move easier for him,

21:33.061 --> 21:36.560
but, hmm,
he'll... he'll find his place.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.359
Mm-hmm.

21:39.894 --> 21:43.426
<i>I'd left a lot behind,
moving to England,</i>

21:43.428 --> 21:45.626
<i>but the letters had followed.</i>

21:45.628 --> 21:49.660
<i>The same night I saw that pilot
of the show he starred in,</i>

21:49.662 --> 21:51.391
<i>I wrote John a letter.</i>

21:51.393 --> 21:53.623
<i>And to my great surprise, he...</i>

21:53.625 --> 21:54.858
<i>He answered!</i>

21:54.860 --> 21:55.859
<i>Yeah!</i>

21:58.593 --> 22:01.892
<i>And what started as a one-off
carried on for years.</i>

22:05.461 --> 22:08.293
<i>Until his death, actually.</i>

22:15.794 --> 22:20.591
"Style is knowing who you are."

22:20.593 --> 22:22.558
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>

22:22.560 --> 22:25.458
<i>And your mother had no idea?</i>

22:25.460 --> 22:27.625
<i>How could that
escape her notice?</i>

22:27.627 --> 22:30.558
<i>I mean, she never saw any
of those letters in the mail?</i>

22:30.560 --> 22:33.624
<i>I think a great deal of things
went unnoticed by my mom</i>

22:33.626 --> 22:34.725
<i>back at the time.</i>

22:34.727 --> 22:36.690
<i>I mean, she was...
she was overwhelmed.</i>

22:36.692 --> 22:37.858
<i>She was never home,</i>

22:37.860 --> 22:40.359
<i>and, well, I was in charge
of the mail, anyway.</i>

22:41.694 --> 22:43.392
<i>So you intercepted them?</i>

22:43.394 --> 22:44.892
<i>I did.</i>

22:44.894 --> 22:47.659
<i>Why? Weren't you proud?</i>

22:47.661 --> 22:50.724
<i>I was, but more than proud,
I was scared,</i>

22:50.726 --> 22:53.491
<i>scared that this
very special thing,</i>

22:53.493 --> 22:55.825
<i>that it'd be taken away from me.</i>

22:57.927 --> 23:02.358
<i>It was the only connection I had
with the life I dreamed of,</i>

23:02.360 --> 23:04.425
<i>so I protected it,</i>

23:05.926 --> 23:08.459
<i>until I thought the day
I'd leave that place,</i>

23:08.461 --> 23:09.891
<i>become an actor...</i>

23:11.692 --> 23:13.491
<i>work with John.</i>

23:16.426 --> 23:19.123
<i>I knew there was
a whole world out there</i>

23:19.125 --> 23:22.624
<i>and that in it,
John lived his life...</i>

23:25.493 --> 23:27.725
<i>...far, far away from mine.</i>

23:57.525 --> 24:00.690
<i>Amy and John grew up together.</i>

24:00.692 --> 24:03.590
<i>They'd always been friends.</i>

24:03.592 --> 24:05.358
<i>Amy was moving to New York</i>

24:05.360 --> 24:08.491
<i>to become an actress
like she'd always dreamed,</i>

24:08.493 --> 24:10.758
<i>and he tagged along.</i>

24:10.760 --> 24:13.857
<i>They were surprised at
how people took for granted</i>

24:13.859 --> 24:15.858
<i>they were together
since day one,</i>

24:15.860 --> 24:17.656
<i>and they went on with it.</i>

24:17.658 --> 24:19.456
<i>One thing led to another...</i>

24:21.826 --> 24:24.858
<i>...for John, mostly.</i>

24:26.860 --> 24:29.492
<i>He kept mentioning
the loneliness.</i>

24:30.592 --> 24:31.758
<i>I knew it meant</i>

24:31.760 --> 24:34.959
<i>there was some company
he couldn't afford having.</i>

24:37.859 --> 24:42.789
<i>What do you mean by
"company he couldn't afford"?</i>

24:42.791 --> 24:46.690
<i>Well, in a life like this,
in, like, his,</i>

24:46.692 --> 24:50.457
<i>everything and everyone in it
becomes a risk.</i>

24:50.459 --> 24:51.789
<i>Hmm...</i>

24:51.791 --> 24:53.789
<i>Yeah, the attention
that you craved,</i>

24:53.791 --> 24:56.758
<i>it becomes the scrutiny
that you're trying to escape.</i>

25:02.058 --> 25:04.624
<i>John often slept in hotel rooms.</i>

25:06.624 --> 25:09.657
<i>I asked him in one of
the early letters why,</i>

25:09.659 --> 25:13.456
<i>and he said it was because
it made him feel less lonely,</i>

25:13.458 --> 25:17.589
<i>which seemed bizarre, a hotel
room being by definition lonely.</i>

25:17.591 --> 25:21.055
<i>He later replied that
the feeling was, uh, alleviated</i>

25:21.057 --> 25:24.956
<i>by the fact that most of the
people in all the other rooms</i>

25:24.958 --> 25:27.424
<i>were alone at
the same time he was.</i>

25:30.792 --> 25:32.589
<i>I mean, it's pretty big</i>

25:32.591 --> 25:34.388
<i>for New York City,</i>

25:34.390 --> 25:36.556
<i>and, uh, you know,
it's modest.</i>

25:36.558 --> 25:38.457
<i>It's kind of a piece of shit,</i>

25:38.459 --> 25:40.924
but it's been home
for a little bit now, so...

25:40.926 --> 25:42.924
It's not too... too
expensive, either.

25:42.926 --> 25:46.389
When Amy and I first
moved into the city,

25:46.391 --> 25:48.390
we lived in Queens off Flushing.

25:48.392 --> 25:49.757
A total shithole.

25:51.491 --> 25:54.656
We couldn't afford electricity
for the first couple of months,

25:54.658 --> 25:56.955
so we had to light
the whole place with candles.

25:56.957 --> 25:58.656
- Shit!
- Yeah.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.823
One of the neighbors
kept complaining

26:01.825 --> 26:04.556
that they smelled...
they smelled smoke.

26:04.558 --> 26:05.923
When the firemen showed up,

26:05.925 --> 26:08.123
I think they thought
we were sacrificing virgins.

26:10.659 --> 26:12.756
We've never been into virgins.

26:27.792 --> 26:29.788
Um, are you
working tomorrow?

26:29.790 --> 26:31.555
Are you shooting
something right now?

26:31.557 --> 26:33.955
Uh, no. No, I'm not
working right now.

26:33.957 --> 26:36.656
I got a 7:00 a.m. call
on <i>Hellsome,</i>

26:36.658 --> 26:38.455
a crazy day full of stunts.

26:38.457 --> 26:39.588
Oh. Yeah.

26:39.590 --> 26:41.056
Um, yeah.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.457
Oh, I'll just...
I'll just have another beer...

26:43.459 --> 26:45.589
...and then I'll be on my way.

26:45.591 --> 26:47.388
I gotta start studying anyway.

26:47.390 --> 26:49.455
I have this audition
on Wednesday...

27:09.024 --> 27:11.888
...I actually auditioned
for <i>Hellsome.</i>

27:11.890 --> 27:13.823
I can't.

27:13.825 --> 27:15.390
You can't?

27:16.422 --> 27:17.855
Um, uh...

27:19.524 --> 27:22.455
Uh, I've got an early
start tomorrow.

27:22.457 --> 27:24.655
Oh, you...
Uh, yeah, I...

27:24.657 --> 27:27.888
Dude, you should
get some rest, anyway.

27:27.890 --> 27:30.922
You got... 7:00 a.m.?
That's early.

27:30.924 --> 27:32.356
Yeah, sorry.

27:32.358 --> 27:36.122
It's OK. I'll... I'll
just let myself out.

27:36.124 --> 27:38.788
Um, thanks for the beer.

27:42.357 --> 27:45.421
<i>And you know
all this from the letters?</i>

27:45.423 --> 27:47.888
<i>Not all of it.</i>

27:47.890 --> 27:50.688
<i>John never put me, as a child,
in a position</i>

27:50.690 --> 27:53.455
<i>where I'd read things
I wouldn't understand.</i>

27:53.457 --> 27:55.855
<i>He would rarely mention
his private life,</i>

27:55.857 --> 27:58.289
<i>not to me, not to anyone.</i>

27:59.489 --> 28:01.554
<i>There were just rules, he said,</i>

28:01.556 --> 28:04.655
<i>if they were broken,
that would destroy him.</i>

28:07.090 --> 28:08.889
âªâª I'm the son of
rage and love âª

28:08.891 --> 28:10.589
âª The Jesus of suburbia âª

28:10.591 --> 28:13.054
âª The bible of
none of the above âª

28:13.056 --> 28:16.723
âª On a steady diet of âª

28:19.723 --> 28:21.787
âª Soda pop and Ritalin âª

28:21.789 --> 28:25.522
âª No one ever died
for their sins in hell âª

28:25.524 --> 28:26.921
âª As far I can tell âª

28:32.789 --> 28:36.821
Mom, you up early
or you're up late?

28:36.823 --> 28:39.654
<i>She'll be here Friday
if your schedule changes.</i>

28:39.656 --> 28:42.121
<i>And I'm making my
Ina Garten Beef Bourguignon.</i>

28:42.123 --> 28:43.121
<i>Your favorite!</i>

28:43.123 --> 28:45.554
- It's so not!
- <i>Excuse me, since when...</i>

28:45.556 --> 28:47.454
Number 2, please.
I don't hate it.

28:47.456 --> 28:51.489
<i>...is Beef Bourguignon not
your favorite meal, Jonathan?</i>

28:51.491 --> 28:53.854
Since you stopped
listening to people, Ma.

28:53.856 --> 28:56.119
And please, please
don't call me Jonathan.

28:56.121 --> 28:58.520
<i>I'll make something else,
and just for you.</i>

28:58.522 --> 28:59.921
Fine. I'm happy with the beef.

28:59.923 --> 29:02.054
<i>And what is wrong
with "Jonathan"?</i>

29:02.056 --> 29:04.455
<i>Anyway, I can make
something else, honey.</i>

29:04.457 --> 29:05.589
I'm fine with the beef.

30:10.488 --> 30:12.387
<i>Let's go.
Let's see it.</i>

30:12.389 --> 30:13.587
<i>Stop fucking around!</i>

30:13.589 --> 30:16.087
<i>You didn't drive 87 miles
in the middle of the night</i>

30:16.089 --> 30:18.055
for the pleasure
of my company.

30:24.588 --> 30:25.985
His name's Will.

30:25.987 --> 30:28.554
- Is that what it is?
- Will Jefford Jr.

30:28.556 --> 30:31.054
We met last summer,
hung out a couple of times.

30:31.056 --> 30:32.821
OK.

30:32.823 --> 30:34.521
I don't know,
I... I like him.

30:34.523 --> 30:35.787
Mm-hmm?

30:36.989 --> 30:38.555
He's cute.

30:39.887 --> 30:43.620
What? What, am I
supposed to say "hot"?

30:44.687 --> 30:45.985
Why, that's a hot guy.

30:45.987 --> 30:48.086
Don't see guys
that hot every day.

30:48.088 --> 30:49.754
Oh, shut the fuck up!

30:51.889 --> 30:53.719
So, what's his deal?

30:53.721 --> 30:55.454
There is no deal.

30:55.456 --> 30:58.118
How many more times
are you gonna come over here,

30:58.120 --> 31:01.486
showing me pics with that dreamy
smile on your face like...

31:01.488 --> 31:02.919
I haven't got
a dreamy smile.

31:02.921 --> 31:04.720
Yes, you do.
You go like this...

31:11.887 --> 31:13.920
What about Amy?

31:20.054 --> 31:21.618
She's used to it.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.985
Oh, she's used to it.
Still going with that?

31:23.987 --> 31:25.886
We are. We're...

31:25.888 --> 31:28.685
- We're used to it, James.
- Yeah.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.553
- We're OK.
- OK.

31:42.088 --> 31:43.720
John...

31:50.887 --> 31:53.051
You guys still
don't understand.

32:00.954 --> 32:02.385
- Don't!
- Fuck off!

32:02.387 --> 32:04.052
Jim! Jimmy!
Bitch-ass motherfucker!

32:04.054 --> 32:07.385
Hey, fuck off!
You know how this ends.

32:07.387 --> 32:09.386
What's the problem?

32:09.388 --> 32:11.418
Will Jefford Jr...

32:11.420 --> 32:12.552
Wow!

32:13.621 --> 32:16.519
This guy is gonna die at
least 4 minutes after me.

32:16.521 --> 32:18.019
Shut up!

32:18.021 --> 32:20.851
Look at all the seconds he's
collecting contracting words.

32:20.853 --> 32:23.351
That is really something.
You're impressed by this?

32:23.353 --> 32:24.551
He's really smart.

32:24.553 --> 32:25.718
Oh, is he?

32:26.787 --> 32:28.385
There you go, my prince.

32:28.387 --> 32:30.886
"You" of course
spelled with a "U"

32:30.888 --> 32:33.353
since we're contracting.

32:33.355 --> 32:36.852
<i>John had been going
to his brother's house</i>

32:36.854 --> 32:38.853
<i>for their garage ritual
for years.</i>

32:38.855 --> 32:40.084
Yep!

32:40.086 --> 32:41.819
<i>Jimmy told me that.</i>

32:41.821 --> 32:44.485
<i>I think it was one of
the only things in his life</i>

32:44.487 --> 32:45.818
<i>that actually made John...</i>

32:45.820 --> 32:47.018
<i>happy.</i>

32:47.020 --> 32:49.951
- Good morning!
- Good morning! How are you?

32:52.354 --> 32:54.819
Guys, this guy here,
this is Will.

33:02.920 --> 33:06.518
<i>Although we never
wrote it in the letters,</i>

33:06.520 --> 33:10.118
<i>John and I had reached a point
of no return in our lives.</i>

33:10.120 --> 33:13.518
<i>I think inviting Will into
his world was John's own way</i>

33:13.520 --> 33:15.952
<i>of unconsciously sabotaging</i>

33:15.954 --> 33:19.384
<i>pretty much everything
he had built.</i>

33:19.386 --> 33:22.019
<i>Of course,
he didn't know that then.</i>

33:23.519 --> 33:25.385
<i>And you?</i>

33:25.387 --> 33:26.685
<i>And... Sorry, what?</i>

33:26.687 --> 33:27.784
<i>And you?</i>

33:27.786 --> 33:30.585
<i>You said John and
yourself were in...</i>

33:30.587 --> 33:32.984
<i>that you'd reached points
of no return.</i>

33:32.986 --> 33:34.017
<i>Hmm...</i>

33:34.019 --> 33:35.819
<i>I'm curious to know
what that was</i>

33:35.821 --> 33:36.918
<i>for a 10-year-old boy.</i>

33:36.920 --> 33:39.353
- <i>Well, it can be many things.</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm?</i>

33:39.355 --> 33:40.884
<i>But that isn't the point.</i>

33:40.886 --> 33:45.718
<i>Then what is the point,
please, Mr. Turner?</i>

33:45.720 --> 33:49.484
<i>The point is a lot
of children are told</i>

33:49.486 --> 33:52.684
<i>that they or their dreams
don't exist or matter</i>

33:52.686 --> 33:54.919
<i>simply because they're young.</i>

33:54.921 --> 33:56.718
<i>And you know what?</i>

33:56.720 --> 33:59.819
<i>Most children will believe you
if you tell them that.</i>

33:59.821 --> 34:02.287
<i>They kept telling me
again and again.</i>

34:03.618 --> 34:06.051
<i>But I decided
not to believe them.</i>

34:06.053 --> 34:08.484
Hello, little girl.

34:39.853 --> 34:42.483
Rupert! What are you
still doing out here?

34:42.485 --> 34:43.650
My mom's late.

34:43.652 --> 34:46.049
What happened to your face?

34:46.051 --> 34:47.617
I fell.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.752
Oh, I see.

34:52.953 --> 34:55.485
<i>"I can't let you on the boat</i>

34:55.487 --> 34:57.585
"without your parents,
young man!

34:57.587 --> 35:01.349
"There's another boat that
leaves for America in 3 days."

35:01.351 --> 35:02.683
So cruel!

35:02.685 --> 35:03.850
God, I love it!

35:03.852 --> 35:06.018
There, take some.

35:07.052 --> 35:08.683
You're good.

35:08.685 --> 35:10.683
Please, I'm terrible.

35:10.685 --> 35:12.551
Carry on!

35:12.553 --> 35:14.050
"Please, sir,

35:14.052 --> 35:17.416
"I know you're not supposed to
let people on without a ticket."

35:17.418 --> 35:18.750
"I most certainly am not!"

35:18.752 --> 35:20.750
Oh, sorry, I dropped it.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.817
No, it's all right.

35:22.819 --> 35:25.518
Is this a friendship necklace?

35:26.686 --> 35:29.051
I used to have one of these.

35:29.053 --> 35:32.084
No, certainly not friendship.
My mom has the same one.

35:32.086 --> 35:34.084
I got the first letter
of her name.

35:34.086 --> 35:36.617
She's got the first
letter of mine.

35:36.619 --> 35:37.918
Oh, how beautiful!

35:37.920 --> 35:39.518
Yeah.

35:41.851 --> 35:43.750
Party's over, I guess.

35:45.551 --> 35:47.882
Where were you?
I was worried sick!

35:47.884 --> 35:50.483
You were late,
so Miss Kureshi drove me.

35:50.485 --> 35:53.983
It's no trouble. I stayed late
for some marking myself, so...

35:53.985 --> 35:56.018
Thanks, Miss Kureshi.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.384
- What happened to your face?
- I fell.

35:58.386 --> 36:00.550
Go inside. I'll take care
of you in a second.

36:00.552 --> 36:02.516
It's my turn to get
a scolding, Rupert!

36:03.852 --> 36:05.951
No, not at all.

36:07.951 --> 36:11.417
It's no trouble dropping him.
I don't live very far away.

36:11.419 --> 36:15.516
You know, I teach Rupert English
in the afternoon, so...

36:15.518 --> 36:17.882
I know who you are,
Miss Kureshi.

36:17.884 --> 36:21.684
Well, thank you so much
for looking after Rupert.

36:25.451 --> 36:27.483
<i>I want names, Rupert.
Who did this to you?</i>

36:27.485 --> 36:29.915
You know, a little less
eye-rolling would be nice.

36:29.917 --> 36:31.749
You don't even
know what happened!

36:31.751 --> 36:33.716
I can see what happened.
I'm not blind.

36:33.718 --> 36:35.515
What difference does it make?

36:35.517 --> 36:37.650
Well, you know what,

36:37.652 --> 36:39.550
if you tell me
who these kids are,

36:39.552 --> 36:41.684
I can give their parents
a phone call.

36:41.686 --> 36:44.449
Mom, that's pathetic!
This isn't anything new.

36:44.451 --> 36:47.416
I'm small, I'm new, I act.

36:47.418 --> 36:49.749
A taller dude
who's got 3 girlfriends

36:49.751 --> 36:51.016
and is on the soccer team

36:51.018 --> 36:52.449
bullies me.

36:52.451 --> 36:54.084
I marvel at the originality.

36:54.086 --> 36:57.383
And Miss Kureshi says ignoring
people is our strongest weapon,

36:57.385 --> 36:58.616
by the way.

36:58.618 --> 37:00.583
Miss Kureshi
should write a book.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.650
Miss Kureshi does
what she loves in life

37:02.652 --> 37:04.350
and is a perfectly
reliable adult.

37:04.352 --> 37:08.449
Well, Rupert, if I'm not
cool enough to help you,

37:08.451 --> 37:09.684
help yourself, OK?

37:09.686 --> 37:13.083
If you're scared of something,
you gotta stand up and face it.

37:13.085 --> 37:15.717
Alan Parrish's dad
said that to him,

37:15.719 --> 37:18.582
and then he got swallowed up
into Jumanji.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.017
Well, then, you're next!

37:20.019 --> 37:22.817
What would you know about
standing and facing things?

37:22.819 --> 37:24.815
You're the first one
to run away!

37:24.817 --> 37:26.549
That's what
you did with Dad,

37:26.551 --> 37:28.549
and that's what
you did with acting!

37:30.616 --> 37:34.449
And that stuff you put
on my lips tastes like piss!

37:35.451 --> 37:36.450
Brat!

37:38.119 --> 37:39.682
Oh!

37:42.850 --> 37:45.782
Look at you!
Am I being served?

37:46.917 --> 37:47.916
Just kidding!

37:47.918 --> 37:48.915
Sorry we're late.

37:48.917 --> 37:50.416
Oh, what a nice surprise!

37:50.418 --> 37:52.083
I didn't think
you guys would make it!

37:52.085 --> 37:53.482
Faith, come up!

37:53.484 --> 37:55.583
Amy and I were supposed
to go to that thing,

37:55.585 --> 37:56.582
but it got canceled.

37:56.584 --> 37:58.116
Ma, I don't like it
on the neck!

37:58.118 --> 38:00.848
I can't help it.
You smell so good!

38:00.850 --> 38:02.048
That Swiss Army!

38:03.685 --> 38:06.414
Oh, Amy, feels like
it's been forever!

38:06.416 --> 38:09.350
I stopped wearing Swiss Army.
You know that.

38:09.352 --> 38:11.047
- No! When?
- When I finished puberty.

38:11.049 --> 38:12.980
Oh, shut up and
give me another hug!

38:12.982 --> 38:14.715
I already gave you a hug, Ma!

38:14.717 --> 38:17.514
I know, but I'm not counting.
Come here, you!

38:17.516 --> 38:20.516
Oh, you smell so good too!
You both smell so good!

38:20.518 --> 38:22.682
What's your perfume
tonight, Ma?

38:22.684 --> 38:25.380
Oh! L'Air du Temps.

38:25.382 --> 38:27.781
Did you bring me some
from Canal Street?

38:27.783 --> 38:30.349
I told you all those
perfumes spoiled.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.081
Oh, who cares?
Nobody can tell.

38:32.083 --> 38:34.082
- Whoo!
- There's my favorite aunt!

38:34.084 --> 38:36.648
Holy Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

38:36.650 --> 38:38.516
- Shit!
- Are these ghosts?

38:41.084 --> 38:42.581
Are you Adam White?

38:42.583 --> 38:44.880
Now, you're not gonna cast
a spell on me, are ya?

38:44.882 --> 38:46.482
No!

38:48.417 --> 38:50.614
Hey! Oh!

38:50.616 --> 38:52.114
Be careful!

38:52.116 --> 38:54.981
He doesn't like too much
hugging or touching!

38:54.983 --> 38:58.014
- Good to see you, Anne.
- Oh, you too, honey!

38:58.016 --> 38:59.615
Oh, you smell so good!

38:59.617 --> 39:00.982
Thank you.

39:00.984 --> 39:03.448
Oh God, Amy!
Look at that coat!

39:03.450 --> 39:04.581
Dressed for success!

39:05.683 --> 39:08.515
Oh! Grace, I thought you said
they couldn't make it.

39:08.517 --> 39:12.048
Bet he did it on purpose!
"Look at me, look at me!" Huh?

39:12.050 --> 39:14.815
But then when was he ever
on time for anything?

39:14.817 --> 39:16.815
Story of his life and his dad's!

39:16.817 --> 39:19.816
- Oh, wonderful!
- I'm gonna open this wine!

39:19.818 --> 39:21.981
Looking so fancy-shmancy...

39:21.983 --> 39:23.948
And so it begins.

39:23.950 --> 39:26.747
Fee, fi, fo, fum,

39:26.749 --> 39:28.881
I smell the blood of
a Beef Bourguignon!

39:28.883 --> 39:30.115
- Oh!
- Whoo!

39:30.117 --> 39:32.048
Back by popular demand,

39:32.050 --> 39:34.715
my Ina Garten
Beef Bourguignon...

39:34.717 --> 39:36.515
Ã  la Grace.

39:36.517 --> 39:38.714
John's not having any

39:38.716 --> 39:40.880
because it's not fancy enough
for him anymore.

39:40.882 --> 39:43.581
But you guys should all
just help yourself,

39:43.583 --> 39:46.680
and I'm gonna go back
and get the potato gratin.

39:46.682 --> 39:48.680
I'm heating something up
for you, honey.

39:48.682 --> 39:51.348
Ma, I told you not
to make anything special.

39:51.350 --> 39:52.880
Don't worry,
it's not special.

39:52.882 --> 39:54.780
It was just gonna be
some Bolognese

39:54.782 --> 39:56.747
and some broccoli and bacon.

39:56.749 --> 40:00.915
You know, like what you used
to have when you played hockey.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.548
Oh, Faith?

40:02.550 --> 40:05.514
Would you please tell me,
though, if it needs more salt,

40:05.516 --> 40:07.115
because, you know,
I don't salt.

40:07.117 --> 40:09.447
John, I drove by
State College's arena

40:09.449 --> 40:10.613
a couple weeks ago.

40:10.615 --> 40:12.613
I was just
wondering, you know,

40:12.615 --> 40:15.047
do you ever think
about hockey, any regrets?

40:15.049 --> 40:17.681
Excellent question.
Let's get to the bottom of this.

40:17.683 --> 40:21.348
Do you regret the life that's brought
you fortune and fame? You gotta, right?

40:21.350 --> 40:24.014
You could have a concussion
right now! Think about it!

40:24.016 --> 40:26.646
Pat, you heard the story
100 times. He got hurt.

40:26.648 --> 40:29.046
You were a great
hockey player.

40:29.048 --> 40:31.348
You're naturally athletic.

40:31.350 --> 40:33.013
I didn't say anything, Ma!

40:33.015 --> 40:34.747
- Faith?
- Uh, it needs salt.

40:34.749 --> 40:36.546
- Ugh!
- But just a little bit.

40:36.548 --> 40:39.113
I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

40:39.115 --> 40:41.480
Oh, do we need wine?
A little bit more?

40:41.482 --> 40:44.380
We're good? No, I'll get some.
I'll get some.

40:44.382 --> 40:46.348
So, John,
what's the big news?

40:46.350 --> 40:49.513
You're ruining the timing
for the sauce, Johnny.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.879
Well, now, nothing's
official, so I...

40:51.881 --> 40:53.814
He's gonna be
Jack Harvest.

40:53.816 --> 40:54.979
Jimmy, what the hell?

40:54.981 --> 40:56.979
Who cares? Who cares?

40:56.981 --> 40:59.814
The universe cares, man!
I said I didn't wanna jinx it.

40:59.816 --> 41:03.014
So, then, don't jinx it.
You're a fucking stud!

41:03.016 --> 41:04.648
This Jack Harvest,
who is he?

41:04.650 --> 41:07.412
I bet he's some sort
of famous Democrat

41:07.414 --> 41:09.978
that they're making
a bio-documentary on!

41:09.980 --> 41:12.380
Pat, Jack Harvest is
a comic-book character,

41:12.382 --> 41:13.979
a sort of superhero.

41:13.981 --> 41:15.347
Oh, I see!

41:15.349 --> 41:17.347
Oh, John, that's so good!

41:17.349 --> 41:20.447
These kinds of movies are
popular right now, aren't they?

41:20.449 --> 41:21.780
But it won't last, will it?

41:21.782 --> 41:23.779
Is everything
going well so far?

41:23.781 --> 41:26.348
Nothing's going anywhere
for now. I'm not cast yet.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.913
- Director loves you. It's done.
- The director chose me.

41:28.915 --> 41:31.946
The studio is most likely
gonna approve me too.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.746
- We're just waiting on some...
- The universe! Fuck yeah!

41:34.748 --> 41:37.880
...negotiations,
but nothing's sure.

41:37.882 --> 41:40.913
You got it, man.
It's done. It's yours.

41:43.615 --> 41:46.947
I screwed up the sauce.
It's too runny. But it's good.

41:48.649 --> 41:50.314
Bon appÃ©tit!

41:55.748 --> 41:58.346
Oh, but Don doesn't know

41:58.348 --> 42:01.646
that Sissy's secret lover
is hiding in the closet!

42:01.648 --> 42:03.847
So, he comes home early,

42:03.849 --> 42:06.647
all, you know, pumped up
to go on their ski trip.

42:06.649 --> 42:10.812
And he goes to the closet,
and he opens the door

42:10.814 --> 42:13.045
to get his ski stuff out
and go skiing!

42:15.514 --> 42:18.580
Oh, Sissy said she still
remembers the look on his face.

42:18.582 --> 42:21.845
The boyfriend just slalomed
right out of there, of course!

42:21.847 --> 42:23.679
Oh, God, Faith!

42:23.681 --> 42:24.946
That reminds me of when

42:24.948 --> 42:27.779
you caught that son-of-a-bitch
husband of yours

42:27.781 --> 42:30.412
when he was in the cabin
with what's-her-name!

42:30.414 --> 42:31.945
Oh God, I never trusted him,

42:31.947 --> 42:34.778
but that was a real
hell of a "I told you so"!

42:35.815 --> 42:37.579
Oh God!

42:37.581 --> 42:40.913
I think I need
a glass of water.

42:41.914 --> 42:43.813
That's a good idea.

42:43.815 --> 42:46.047
Ma, why don't we hop off Jimmy

42:46.049 --> 42:48.877
and help Auntie Faith
get everybody a glass of water?

42:48.879 --> 42:51.578
Oh, Jonathan,
don't patronize me now.

42:51.580 --> 42:55.879
I am absolutely not
patronizing you, Grace.

42:55.881 --> 42:57.712
Yes, you are!

42:57.714 --> 42:59.412
Anyone, water?

42:59.414 --> 43:00.780
Water?
What are we, at church?

43:00.782 --> 43:02.646
Anne, water?

43:02.648 --> 43:03.946
Yes, please!

43:03.948 --> 43:06.579
Maybe no one else
wants a drink, Ma.

43:06.581 --> 43:08.578
Yeah, I think
we've all had enough.

43:08.580 --> 43:10.779
We're all grown-ups here.

43:10.781 --> 43:13.611
OK, so, um,

43:13.613 --> 43:17.079
everybody wants whiskey
except for Anne and John.

43:17.081 --> 43:18.078
Boo! And Amy.

43:19.081 --> 43:20.346
Oops! Boo!

43:20.348 --> 43:22.445
Uh, anyway,
you probably shouldn't.

43:22.447 --> 43:24.378
Because of your medication.

43:24.380 --> 43:25.779
Oh!

43:26.880 --> 43:27.978
Clever!

43:27.980 --> 43:30.846
- Let's call it a night, Grace.
- Why?

43:30.848 --> 43:33.410
There's still
whiskey to drink, Jimmy!

43:33.412 --> 43:34.878
Thanks for having my back!

43:34.880 --> 43:35.944
Hey, fuck you!

43:35.946 --> 43:36.912
Wow!

43:36.914 --> 43:40.046
I know! Why don't you guys
spend the night?

43:40.048 --> 43:43.047
'Cause I have cinnamon rolls
in the freezer for tomorrow!

43:44.547 --> 43:47.546
I think we're gonna
hit the road.

43:47.548 --> 43:49.678
Oh!

43:49.680 --> 43:52.979
Oh, is this a hotel night?

43:54.080 --> 43:56.346
You know, Patty,

43:56.348 --> 43:58.779
John loves to go
to a hotel sometimes.

43:58.781 --> 44:03.078
I thought you guys just moved
into a new billion-dollar place.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.911
Well, they have,
but, you know,

44:04.913 --> 44:07.412
sometimes he needs some peace.

44:07.414 --> 44:09.677
Peace? For what?

44:09.679 --> 44:11.778
Mm-hmm!

44:11.780 --> 44:13.812
Oh! Careful, Amy!

44:13.814 --> 44:16.812
Yeah, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

44:16.814 --> 44:18.444
Enough, Ma! Enough!

44:18.446 --> 44:20.645
Gracie, I'm gonna get going.

44:20.647 --> 44:23.045
Can you pay attention
to people, Ma?

44:23.047 --> 44:24.479
Your sister? Jimmy?

44:24.481 --> 44:28.412
Me? Anything but
that fucking bottle!

44:28.414 --> 44:30.047
I'm not a child!

44:31.547 --> 44:35.511
All I ever do is
pay attention to you!

44:35.513 --> 44:38.645
And everybody else likes
my Beef Bourguignon!

44:38.647 --> 44:41.711
Everybody else likes my coffee!

44:41.713 --> 44:45.878
So why don't you stop being
such a snob and just sit down!

44:45.880 --> 44:48.745
You're embarrassing
yourself, Ma.

44:48.747 --> 44:51.645
OK, easy.
Just relax there, Brad Pitt!

44:51.647 --> 44:53.745
Shut the fuck up!

44:53.747 --> 44:56.611
- You watch your fucking mouth!
- Stop!

44:56.613 --> 44:59.446
Jesus Christ! Where did you
learn to speak to your elders?

44:59.448 --> 45:01.511
You don't get to tell me
to shut the fuck up!

45:01.513 --> 45:04.011
And you don't get to talk
to your mother that way.

45:04.013 --> 45:06.644
When I think of what
you put her through,

45:06.646 --> 45:08.644
the medications, the bills,

45:08.646 --> 45:12.010
the doctors, the shrinks,
the scuffles at school...

45:12.012 --> 45:14.111
You and your goddamn hockey,

45:14.113 --> 45:16.078
and that piece of shit
you call a father!

45:16.080 --> 45:17.345
SHUT UP!

45:34.646 --> 45:36.478
<i>I've never been one</i>

45:36.480 --> 45:38.777
<i>to really believe
in synchronicity</i>

45:38.779 --> 45:41.977
<i>or destiny or horoscope
or anything like that.</i>

45:41.979 --> 45:43.877
<i>No?</i>

45:43.879 --> 45:48.344
<i>But, uh, that night,
something in the universe,</i>

45:48.346 --> 45:50.911
<i>yeah, must have just gone...</i>

45:50.913 --> 45:52.777
<i>ka-ching!</i>

45:52.779 --> 45:57.077
<i>What exactly are you implying
with that sound you made?</i>

45:57.079 --> 45:59.077
<i>That this sort
of synchronicity</i>

45:59.079 --> 46:00.811
<i>isn't just a coincidence.</i>

46:00.813 --> 46:03.110
<i>I actually knew nothing
of John's life,</i>

46:03.112 --> 46:04.711
<i>and could never have guessed</i>

46:04.713 --> 46:07.410
<i>that the mistakes
we were both about to make</i>

46:07.412 --> 46:09.678
<i>would so dramatically coincide.</i>

46:47.846 --> 46:49.677
Hey!

47:11.446 --> 47:13.643
That's the guy from
the fucking show!

49:32.711 --> 49:37.042
Oh! Oh my gosh!

49:43.477 --> 49:44.874
Latte?

49:44.876 --> 49:47.909
Um, my heart might explode.

49:47.911 --> 49:50.343
I promise it won't.

49:52.344 --> 49:54.309
Thanks.

50:02.509 --> 50:04.541
So, you don't
remember me, do you?

50:06.809 --> 50:10.009
From before we met last summer,
before we hung out.

50:11.078 --> 50:12.775
Before.

50:14.842 --> 50:18.674
I... I'm from,
uh, Pleasant Gap.

50:20.877 --> 50:23.509
That's near
University Park.

50:25.409 --> 50:26.542
No way!

50:26.544 --> 50:28.607
You studied there, right?

50:28.609 --> 50:32.608
You were playing for
the Badgers, the Raging Badgers.

50:32.610 --> 50:34.310
Yeah.

50:36.475 --> 50:39.740
Well, I've been, you know,
following all your exploits,

50:39.742 --> 50:43.442
and I read up about you
in the newspaper, and...

50:43.444 --> 50:45.940
until you blew up,
and then I, uh...

50:45.942 --> 50:47.407
Actually, you kind of...

50:47.409 --> 50:49.809
You kind of inspired me
to become an actor.

50:49.811 --> 50:53.407
I broke up with my boyfriend.
Well, ex-boyfriend now.

50:53.409 --> 50:56.642
That was pretty bad.
But, yeah...

50:58.408 --> 51:01.641
I never ever thought
I'd see you again.

51:02.842 --> 51:04.441
It's funny.

51:04.443 --> 51:06.842
Yeah, it's funny.

51:14.544 --> 51:16.341
Why didn't you tell me?

51:16.343 --> 51:19.276
I... I don't know.
I thought...

51:20.607 --> 51:21.807
I don't know.

51:21.809 --> 51:23.808
Uh, you wouldn't remember me,

51:23.810 --> 51:26.473
or you wouldn't want me
to remember you or...

51:26.475 --> 51:28.041
I don't know.

51:28.043 --> 51:29.641
How's your mom?

51:29.643 --> 51:31.807
I remember she used to
come watch you play.

51:31.809 --> 51:33.875
She had a really,
really loud laugh.

51:33.877 --> 51:35.873
It was... it was fun!

51:35.875 --> 51:37.440
Yeah, she's fine.

51:37.442 --> 51:39.107
And your brother,
Jimmy, right?

51:39.109 --> 51:40.772
Jimmy?

51:40.774 --> 51:42.540
Yeah, I... I...

51:44.508 --> 51:48.475
I can't...
I can't do this.

51:55.509 --> 51:58.007
Look, Will...

51:58.009 --> 51:59.941
You're nice, but I...

52:01.575 --> 52:04.472
I mean, you're really nice,
but I...

52:04.474 --> 52:06.074
I can't.

52:06.076 --> 52:08.675
This is... This is...

52:09.974 --> 52:11.006
This is wrong.

52:11.008 --> 52:13.474
This is trouble.
This is, uh...

52:15.776 --> 52:17.642
I can't afford this.

52:24.874 --> 52:26.773
God!

52:27.776 --> 52:29.606
You're so sweet.

52:29.608 --> 52:31.441
You too.

52:31.443 --> 52:33.441
I mean, you're nice, but...

52:48.975 --> 52:51.774
Thanks for the coffee.

53:16.475 --> 53:19.505
<i>I didn't really
understand John's rules then.</i>

53:19.507 --> 53:21.505
- <i>But I think I do now.</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm?</i>

53:21.507 --> 53:24.506
<i>How can someone live
a constant, permanent lie?</i>

53:24.508 --> 53:26.640
I mean, you have to escape!

53:26.642 --> 53:29.706
There is a moment
when the mask...

53:29.708 --> 53:31.474
cracks, right?

53:35.107 --> 53:36.939
I'm sorry, Mr. Turner.

53:36.941 --> 53:41.739
I'm just back from Islamabad.
I go to Nigeria next week.

53:41.741 --> 53:45.373
This whole conversation
just seems out of this wor...

53:45.375 --> 53:47.371
out of my world.

53:47.373 --> 53:49.105
This must be hard
to bear, right?

53:49.107 --> 53:51.339
It is!
Yes, it is! It is!

53:51.341 --> 53:54.339
I just... How do I
put this diplomatically?

53:54.341 --> 53:56.939
With all due
respect, honestly,

53:56.941 --> 53:59.706
as much as I would
love to commiserate

53:59.708 --> 54:02.372
with Mr. Donovan's
problems, it's...

54:02.374 --> 54:04.671
To me, they're just mishaps
from the First World.

54:04.673 --> 54:05.706
You know what I mean?

54:05.708 --> 54:07.640
What are you
doing in Prague?

54:09.940 --> 54:13.039
Well, I... I live
between here and London.

54:13.041 --> 54:15.371
Oh no, sorry,
I meant your real home.

54:15.373 --> 54:18.605
Aren't you from the Congo,
the DRC, originally?

54:19.873 --> 54:21.605
I thought I read
that last night.

54:21.607 --> 54:23.605
It's hard to know
who the interviewer is

54:23.607 --> 54:24.604
with you, Mr. Turner.

54:24.606 --> 54:25.839
Yeah, I was born in Bukavu.

54:25.841 --> 54:27.372
We're digressing.
I'm trying...

54:27.374 --> 54:29.106
No, I think we're
cutting the bullshit.

54:29.108 --> 54:31.738
Do you feel like you and I
come from different planets?

54:31.740 --> 54:33.939
'Cause we don't.

54:33.941 --> 54:36.072
Sorry, why would you be
fighting for truth

54:36.074 --> 54:38.605
and I for, uh, for shit?

54:38.607 --> 54:41.471
We're taking this just
a little bit personally.

54:41.473 --> 54:43.571
No, you think
stories don't travel?

54:43.573 --> 54:45.539
Some kid telling a story.

54:45.541 --> 54:47.539
But you're not
a kid anymore,

54:47.541 --> 54:49.504
and you keep referring
to yourself as one.

54:49.506 --> 54:51.604
So stop treating me
like a fucking child!

54:51.606 --> 54:53.405
This is a story
about intolerance.

54:53.407 --> 54:56.339
This is a story about how
a business has been so scared

54:56.341 --> 54:59.071
to lose a public it claims
illiterate and small-minded,

54:59.073 --> 55:02.004
that it's basically kept it
illiterate and small-minded

55:02.006 --> 55:03.038
for decades!

55:03.040 --> 55:04.539
This is about us...

55:05.541 --> 55:06.772
as a society,

55:06.774 --> 55:08.772
what we want,
what we seek!

55:08.774 --> 55:11.772
What in there sounds too
unreal or unworthy to you?

55:11.774 --> 55:13.705
OK, I didn't
mean to upset you.

55:13.707 --> 55:16.538
No, you're putting your
life in peril for truth,

55:16.540 --> 55:19.671
and we're strutting around in
our First World problems.

55:19.673 --> 55:21.339
God, that notion
of privilege

55:21.341 --> 55:23.404
and what people can
say or cannot say

55:23.406 --> 55:25.739
if they haven't gone
through enough shit in life

55:25.741 --> 55:26.939
to be able to commiserate,

55:26.941 --> 55:28.804
it's a fucking disease!

55:28.806 --> 55:31.671
That's where I come from.

55:31.673 --> 55:33.105
Here.

55:33.107 --> 55:35.005
You and I want
the same thing:

55:35.007 --> 55:38.739
Change, impact on
the fears of people,

55:38.741 --> 55:40.538
ignorance, bigotry,

55:40.540 --> 55:42.869
sexism, racism,
homophobia, name it!

55:42.871 --> 55:46.671
What, did you think you had
the monopoly on those battles?

56:37.340 --> 56:38.772
Where were we?

56:41.906 --> 56:43.803
Hey!

56:43.805 --> 56:45.770
I said:
"Where were we?

56:55.605 --> 56:56.836
So...

56:59.840 --> 57:02.936
Well, Rupert?
We are all ears.

57:04.838 --> 57:07.936
I started to do research
on John F. Donovan

57:07.938 --> 57:09.638
about 5 years ago.

57:09.640 --> 57:12.836
When I discovered that we both
have many things in common,

57:12.838 --> 57:16.370
like the fact that we both have
complicated relationships

57:16.372 --> 57:17.771
with our fathers

57:17.773 --> 57:20.104
and dreamed of acting
since a very young age,

57:20.106 --> 57:21.836
I wrote a letter to him.

57:21.838 --> 57:24.471
It was rather foolish of me
to think he would answer,

57:24.473 --> 57:25.672
but he did.

57:27.838 --> 57:30.503
Because you're both gay boys.

57:32.605 --> 57:35.905
Cedric, warning number two.

57:35.907 --> 57:40.703
He did, and that is the object
I've chosen to talk about.

57:40.705 --> 57:42.370
For almost 6 years now,

57:42.372 --> 57:45.003
John F. Donovan and I have been
writing to each other

57:45.005 --> 57:46.602
about once or twice a month.

57:46.604 --> 57:48.804
He tells me everything
about his movie shoots

57:48.806 --> 57:50.370
and the art of cinema,

57:50.372 --> 57:52.638
as well as
the complexities of it.

57:52.640 --> 57:56.937
He tells me about
his premieres, press junkets...

57:56.939 --> 58:00.537
a junket is a press conference
with a lot of journalists...

58:00.539 --> 58:01.968
the way he met his wife, Amy,

58:01.970 --> 58:04.069
and how hard it's been
with his mother

58:04.071 --> 58:06.502
and how she's reacted
to his career.

58:06.504 --> 58:08.935
But that was before
he became real famous.

58:08.937 --> 58:12.437
He never stopped
writing ever since.

58:12.439 --> 58:14.336
Now, I'm only 11 years old,

58:14.338 --> 58:16.103
but, later, I'll be like him,

58:16.105 --> 58:18.470
and we'll act
in movies together.

58:18.472 --> 58:20.637
John, but I like
to call him "J,"

58:20.639 --> 58:23.402
often quotes Gore Vidal,
an author, critic and essayist.

58:23.404 --> 58:25.501
Who cares?

58:25.503 --> 58:28.803
"Style is knowing
who you are."

58:28.805 --> 58:32.436
Well, John F. Donovan knows
exactly who he is,

58:32.438 --> 58:34.336
and I know who I am.

58:34.338 --> 58:37.803
I'm an actor, and I'm
John F. Donovan's friend.

58:40.937 --> 58:42.968
Bullshit!

58:42.970 --> 58:46.369
Cedric! That's it! Out!

58:46.371 --> 58:50.969
Miss, you must admit
it's total bullshit!

58:50.971 --> 58:52.836
It isn't bullshit, fucker!

58:52.838 --> 58:54.103
Ooh!

58:54.105 --> 58:55.969
Stop with the foul language!

58:55.971 --> 58:58.337
You lying little girl!

58:58.339 --> 59:00.903
I got the letters
in my backpack, dickhead!

59:00.905 --> 59:03.036
- You're just jealous!
- Shut up, bitch!

59:04.038 --> 59:06.803
Cedric, out now!

59:06.805 --> 59:11.435
I think what she's really
saying is piss off, Cedric!

59:13.770 --> 59:15.436
Rupert, stay a moment, please!

59:15.438 --> 59:17.803
Cedric, you'll be
punished tomorrow.

59:17.805 --> 59:20.536
I won't have rudeness
in my classroom!

59:23.438 --> 59:24.969
Come on!

59:28.871 --> 59:30.102
Quickly!

59:41.571 --> 59:43.402
Rupert, come here.

59:43.404 --> 59:45.403
Come on!

59:53.670 --> 59:55.469
Rupert, you are
aware of the fact

59:55.471 --> 59:56.935
that I'm gonna
have to fail you?

59:56.937 --> 59:58.935
- Why? Wasn't it good?
- It was excellent.

59:58.937 --> 01:00:00.936
And it would've been great

01:00:00.938 --> 01:00:02.902
for your story exercise
back in September.

01:00:02.904 --> 01:00:05.101
You have great
writing skills, Rupert.

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:07.467
But I couldn't have
been more specific

01:00:07.469 --> 01:00:09.402
about the criteria
of the exercise!

01:00:09.404 --> 01:00:11.702
- It had to be real.
- But John F. Donovan is real!

01:00:11.704 --> 01:00:15.035
Yes, he is, but you
made up that story.

01:00:15.037 --> 01:00:17.436
I... I didn't!

01:00:17.438 --> 01:00:19.635
You know I appreciate
how creative you are.

01:00:19.637 --> 01:00:21.801
But, Miss Kureshi,
it is true!

01:00:21.803 --> 01:00:23.400
- Oh, Rupert!
- I swear!

01:00:23.402 --> 01:00:24.868
I brought the letters,

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.835
but the bell rang, and I just
couldn't show 'em to the class!

01:00:27.837 --> 01:00:29.569
May I see them?

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.302
Rupert?

01:00:43.904 --> 01:00:45.469
Well?

01:00:47.338 --> 01:00:48.769
Shit!

01:00:55.502 --> 01:00:58.536
Nice letters!
Thank you so much!

01:00:58.538 --> 01:01:01.703
Beautiful! Bye!

01:01:16.471 --> 01:01:19.067
Dad, are you even
listening to me?

01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:20.534
Um, hold on.

01:01:20.536 --> 01:01:22.334
Yeah, OK.
I'll see you...

01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:24.901
Dad!

01:01:48.636 --> 01:01:50.534
Pfft!

01:01:50.536 --> 01:01:52.634
Helena Bonham Carter!

01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:55.001
Who are you?

01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:59.867
Hey, Phil!

01:01:59.869 --> 01:02:01.101
How are you?

01:02:01.103 --> 01:02:02.701
Good weekend?

01:02:02.703 --> 01:02:04.033
- Good!
- Yeah?

01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:05.099
Gil, how's it going?

01:02:05.101 --> 01:02:06.300
Nice to see you.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:15.668
I think we're
good here.

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.534
<i>OK, great.</i>

01:02:21.002 --> 01:02:23.735
I know!
I don't know what's going on.

01:02:23.737 --> 01:02:25.599
OK, I heard that
they met in a bar.

01:02:25.601 --> 01:02:27.967
They've been
together for months.

01:02:27.969 --> 01:02:29.033
Really?

01:02:29.035 --> 01:02:31.000
This has been going on
for a while.

01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:32.734
- Oh my God!
- You've met him!

01:02:32.736 --> 01:02:34.600
The blond guy
he brought on set.

01:02:34.602 --> 01:02:37.000
Apparently, there's
actually a story online.

01:02:37.002 --> 01:02:39.967
- Really?
- I haven't read it yet...

01:02:39.969 --> 01:02:41.701
Looking good, Johnny!

01:02:45.436 --> 01:02:46.665
Pfft!

01:02:55.601 --> 01:02:58.767
It's great! He sees an
opportunity to perform.

01:02:58.769 --> 01:03:01.966
Hey! You don't have the right
to read the letters!

01:03:01.968 --> 01:03:04.434
Don't worry, mate,

01:03:04.436 --> 01:03:06.899
we will respect
your privacy.

01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:09.701
And my most basic rights,
thank you.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:13.401
Yeah, I mean, do you want us
to gift-wrap them for you?

01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:17.733
Uh, excuse me, sir?

01:03:17.735 --> 01:03:21.434
Um, my son was arrested?

01:03:28.335 --> 01:03:31.433
Listen, Liz, Liz,
can I talk to you for a second?

01:03:31.435 --> 01:03:32.733
I was going to craft.

01:03:32.735 --> 01:03:35.499
- Yeah, the thing is...
- Yeah?

01:03:35.501 --> 01:03:37.434
I need a coffee too.
Come here.

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:44.635
What's the deal?

01:03:47.001 --> 01:03:48.632
What?

01:03:48.634 --> 01:03:51.499
It's probably just spam.

01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:56.433
I mean, you weren't even with
Will Jefford Jr. this weekend.

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.567
Were you?

01:04:20.601 --> 01:04:23.599
How you could disappoint me
in so many different ways

01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:25.434
in the course of
a single evening

01:04:25.436 --> 01:04:27.932
is nothing short of
extraordinary, Rupert Turner.

01:04:27.934 --> 01:04:29.399
I am pretty impressive.

01:04:39.735 --> 01:04:41.999
You lie to your teachers.

01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:43.933
You drag me out of work

01:04:43.935 --> 01:04:46.332
to come pick you up
at the police station

01:04:46.334 --> 01:04:49.533
after you've been arrested for
breaking into someone's house!

01:04:49.535 --> 01:04:51.532
What the hell, Rupert?

01:04:51.534 --> 01:04:53.398
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.599
No, sorry isn't good enough!

01:04:55.601 --> 01:04:57.666
I want an explanation now!

01:04:57.668 --> 01:05:01.433
I've been exchanging letters
with John F. Donovan.

01:05:01.435 --> 01:05:03.565
The actor from...
from the show?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:07.100
Yes. I've been writing
letters to him for 5 years now.

01:05:07.102 --> 01:05:10.998
He answered the first one,
the one we wrote together.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.597
He wrote back?

01:05:12.599 --> 01:05:13.598
Yes.

01:05:15.534 --> 01:05:17.632
You never told me?

01:05:17.634 --> 01:05:19.898
What did he
even write you?

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.032
Nothing, just stuff about
movies and family and friends.

01:05:24.034 --> 01:05:26.799
Acting.

01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:28.465
How many letters?

01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:29.997
Many.

01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:32.664
Like, how many?
Five, 10, 20? How many?

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:34.333
100, give or take.

01:05:34.335 --> 01:05:36.832
Give...
Holy shit, Rupert!

01:05:36.834 --> 01:05:40.500
What's the matter with you?
How much do you hate me?

01:05:44.468 --> 01:05:46.634
Oh!

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.098
- Why would you lie to me?
- I never lied.

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.699
Please! You're a compulsive
liar just like your father!

01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:57.698
I just didn't say anything!

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.532
Excuse my poor
choice of words!

01:06:00.534 --> 01:06:03.765
You lied, Rupert,
and you lied for years!

01:06:03.767 --> 01:06:06.665
And I won't be treated like
a stranger in our own house.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:07.865
I'm your mother!

01:06:07.867 --> 01:06:10.597
Are you?
Because you never ask!

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:14.098
You never ask anything about
my acting or my auditions.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.532
It's just bullshit, Mom!
It's embarrassing, OK?

01:06:17.534 --> 01:06:20.864
It's embarrassing that
we left America to come here.

01:06:20.866 --> 01:06:22.499
For what? For who?

01:06:22.501 --> 01:06:24.999
Dad doesn't even have
the time to see me,

01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:27.965
so what's the purpose
of coming to England

01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:31.997
except lying to yourself
about this whole great, new life

01:06:31.999 --> 01:06:36.364
that you can have away from
my friends, my life, my school!

01:06:36.366 --> 01:06:40.030
Just because you suddenly
realized you failed!

01:06:40.032 --> 01:06:42.631
So, no, I never talked
about the letters

01:06:42.633 --> 01:06:44.765
because you probably
would've freaked out

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:47.065
and forbidden me to write
to the only person

01:06:47.067 --> 01:06:49.698
that seems to care about me

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:54.930
in this utterly stupid, banal,
point-fucking-less life

01:06:54.932 --> 01:06:56.864
I can't wait to get out of,

01:06:56.866 --> 01:06:59.831
away from you,
away from this place

01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:03.965
and your small dreams
and your smallness!

01:07:07.701 --> 01:07:10.631
Well, you just said goodbye
to that audition in London.

01:07:10.633 --> 01:07:12.363
Big frickin' surprise!

01:07:12.365 --> 01:07:14.030
You couldn't have it,
so neither can I.

01:07:14.032 --> 01:07:16.531
RUPERT, SHUT UP!

01:07:22.534 --> 01:07:25.331
Oh, it's probably
Scotland Yard!

01:07:29.366 --> 01:07:32.530
Ma'am, how long has your son
been writing to John F. Donovan?

01:07:33.665 --> 01:07:35.898
Does he write often?

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.598
Do you know
what your son writes?

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.997
Ma'am! Ma'am!

01:07:41.098 --> 01:07:43.431
Oh, fuck!

01:07:43.433 --> 01:07:47.564
And now Tom with a frankly
bizarre story out of Harrow.

01:07:47.566 --> 01:07:52.065
Tell us, Tom, how a TV star
and an 11-year-old are connected

01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:54.763
to an incident involving
the local police?

01:07:54.765 --> 01:07:57.397
Can you give us
any clarity on this, Tom?

01:07:57.399 --> 01:07:59.964
Hey, are we sure about
the age? I mean, 11 years old.

01:07:59.966 --> 01:08:01.864
That's a load of bollocks.
Come on!

01:08:01.866 --> 01:08:04.065
Run it, Rhys.
Richard wrote it.

01:08:04.067 --> 01:08:07.963
Bloody hell!
How do you like them apples?

01:08:07.965 --> 01:08:10.829
I'm an 18-year-old girl.
I have needs. I need you.

01:08:10.831 --> 01:08:12.396
I keep having
those visions.

01:08:12.398 --> 01:08:14.564
The ones from
when I healed you?

01:08:14.566 --> 01:08:17.029
Sarah, this...
That's normal.

01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:20.430
The day I saved you,
our souls were linked forever.

01:08:20.433 --> 01:08:21.798
I can't explain why, but...

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.763
- Aw, shit!
- What?

01:08:24.765 --> 01:08:27.430
Busy weekend,
huh, Johnny boy?

01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:31.562
Busy boy, right, Johnny?

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:32.729
Uh, yeah.

01:08:32.732 --> 01:08:35.430
- Billy!
- You all right, my man?

01:08:35.432 --> 01:08:38.064
Billy, we're running lines.

01:08:38.066 --> 01:08:41.496
Sorry, Miss Jones.

01:08:41.497 --> 01:08:44.397
That guy is such
a douche. Jesus!

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:46.930
Um, Adam,
what about Diego?

01:08:46.933 --> 01:08:49.098
He's starting to ask questions.
He knows.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.861
We'll just get Bella
to visit him in his dreams,

01:08:51.863 --> 01:08:52.929
erase his memories.

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:55.095
Ah, fuck me!
Give me a fucking break!

01:08:55.096 --> 01:08:57.828
John, do you want me
to call a set medic?

01:08:57.831 --> 01:09:00.763
Uh, yeah, to the ER, please!
More press!

01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:03.331
Hey, Johnny! So, what's this
whole letters thing?

01:09:03.332 --> 01:09:05.430
- Speak up, James.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:07.761
Johnny, what is going on
with, uh, the letters?

01:09:07.764 --> 01:09:09.962
What letters?

01:09:09.965 --> 01:09:11.895
You're writing letters
to some kid?

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.464
That's cute, uh...

01:09:16.331 --> 01:09:18.997
OK. Um, yeah, just keep
running your lines.

01:09:18.999 --> 01:09:21.796
We got time.
They are setting up the rig.

01:09:21.799 --> 01:09:23.796
- You've got, like, 20 or...
- Thank you.

01:09:23.798 --> 01:09:26.363
What did he say?
I couldn't hear a word.

01:10:00.332 --> 01:10:03.395
Uh, Liz, could you read
this link Barbara sent me?

01:10:03.397 --> 01:10:05.362
My eyes are killing me.

01:10:05.364 --> 01:10:08.029
Loud, but not
too loud, 'cause...

01:10:08.031 --> 01:10:10.929
"Letters to a child actor
and risky sex

01:10:10.931 --> 01:10:13.494
"lead to JFD's
biggest secret ever."

01:10:13.496 --> 01:10:15.497
John, we should be rehearsing.

01:10:16.964 --> 01:10:18.662
"The affair went public

01:10:18.664 --> 01:10:21.829

- What?

01:10:49.698 --> 01:10:52.595
Meds. Clonazepam, Xanax?

01:10:52.597 --> 01:10:55.429
You don't have any, uh...

01:10:55.431 --> 01:10:57.462
lithium, do you?

01:10:57.464 --> 01:10:58.662
- What?
- Meds, Liz.

01:10:58.664 --> 01:11:00.795
I need some fucking meds.
Do you have any?

01:11:00.797 --> 01:11:03.462
- I only have natural things.
- Oh, fuck me!

01:11:04.463 --> 01:11:05.961
Do you want Rescue Remedy?

01:11:06.964 --> 01:11:08.461
Hey, Johnny!
John, John!

01:11:08.463 --> 01:11:10.829
Scale of 1-10,
what do you give me?

01:11:10.831 --> 01:11:12.762
Huh? What am I?

01:11:12.764 --> 01:11:15.528
These fucking morons say you
won't give me more than a 5.

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:16.962
Fuck that, right?

01:11:16.964 --> 01:11:19.328
OMG, Billy, you are
so annoying right now!

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:20.528
Hey, what's, um...

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:22.895
What's with this
Brit-kid bullshit?

01:11:22.897 --> 01:11:26.361
You writing letters to this kid?
Wow, busy weekend, huh?

01:11:26.363 --> 01:11:27.561
John, are you all right?

01:11:27.563 --> 01:11:29.329
Jesus Christ!

01:11:30.797 --> 01:11:32.096
Busy boy, right, Johnny?

01:11:32.098 --> 01:11:34.493
How do you like them apples?

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.595
You wanna know
about my fucking weekend,

01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:44.728
you son of a bitch?

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.062
You think I wanna tell you

01:11:46.064 --> 01:11:47.528
about my fucking weekend?

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:48.894
Don't you fucking touch me!

01:11:48.896 --> 01:11:51.661
- Oh my God!
- Don't you fucking dare!

01:11:51.663 --> 01:11:53.360
Johnny, I'm sorry.

01:11:53.362 --> 01:11:56.428
You fucking call me Johnny?
Who the fuck do you think I am?

01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:57.594
Who the fuck are you?

01:11:57.596 --> 01:11:59.429
Uh, Brian, get over here.

01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:01.593
Johnny has flipped his shit!
Shut up!

01:12:01.595 --> 01:12:03.360
I thought
we were friends.

01:12:03.362 --> 01:12:06.495
No! No, we're
not friends, man!

01:12:06.497 --> 01:12:08.795
We're not fucking friends!

01:12:08.797 --> 01:12:13.362
I come here, I say my fucking
lines, and you don't know me.

01:12:13.364 --> 01:12:15.861
You don't know my life.
You don't know my past.

01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:17.628
You don't know
my fucking secrets!

01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:20.527
And I say hello, and I tell you
about my fucking weekend

01:12:20.529 --> 01:12:21.695
because if I don't,

01:12:21.697 --> 01:12:23.894
you're gonna go out there
and tell everybody

01:12:23.896 --> 01:12:26.529
what a pretentious piece
of shit I am, right?

01:12:26.531 --> 01:12:28.028
Yeah? Yeah?

01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:31.393
"Don't tell us this bastard
never takes a shit

01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:32.761
"like the rest of us!"

01:12:32.763 --> 01:12:35.061
Well, he sure does, Billy!

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:36.959
He sure as fuck does!

01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:39.627
And he's so grateful,
and he's so nice,

01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:42.329
and he's so fucking happy

01:12:42.331 --> 01:12:46.695
that he's gonna tell you
all about his fucking weekend!

01:13:02.563 --> 01:13:04.362
Shit!

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:07.794
- Next!
- Next is "pen pals," I believe.

01:13:07.796 --> 01:13:10.362
This one's my favorite,
maybe ever!

01:13:10.364 --> 01:13:11.461
It's so good.

01:13:11.463 --> 01:13:14.095
It's so good, I wanna hear you
ask me the question.

01:13:14.097 --> 01:13:15.326
All right!

01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:20.327
<i>OK, do you have a pen pal?</i>

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:22.859
<i>Child pen pal.
Do your job.</i>

01:13:24.963 --> 01:13:27.360
<i>Do you have a child pen pal
in England?</i>

01:13:28.797 --> 01:13:31.660
<i>I mean, why not?
Why not England?</i>

01:13:31.662 --> 01:13:34.027
<i>They speak English.
I speak English.</i>

01:13:34.029 --> 01:13:36.759
<i>I mean, it's a match made
in heaven, right?</i>

01:13:36.761 --> 01:13:38.328
<i>Keep going!</i>

01:13:40.761 --> 01:13:43.627
<i>Do you have
a written correspondence</i>

01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:45.094
<i>with a British child actor?</i>

01:13:45.096 --> 01:13:47.393
<i>And have I had it for years?</i>

01:13:47.395 --> 01:13:51.026
<i>I mean, in the article I read,
and I read 'em all...</i>

01:13:51.028 --> 01:13:52.293
<i>I gotta!</i>

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:56.759
<i>I mean, I gotta! How else would
I know what I've been up to?</i>

01:13:56.761 --> 01:13:59.925
<i>I mean, and I've been busy, man!</i>

01:13:59.927 --> 01:14:02.493
<i>I've been really busy!</i>

01:14:51.429 --> 01:14:53.794
<i>That's just awful.</i>

01:14:55.063 --> 01:14:57.295
Yeah, it wasn't great.

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.359
And then did he write back

01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:03.493
to say he was sorry,
to explain himself?

01:15:03.495 --> 01:15:04.725
No, of course, he did.

01:15:04.727 --> 01:15:06.759
But, you know, being
ignored that night

01:15:06.761 --> 01:15:08.659
wasn't what hurt most.

01:15:08.661 --> 01:15:11.026
I knew he didn't have
a choice. I understood.

01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:13.327
And it hurt to understand.

01:15:13.329 --> 01:15:18.025
But, no, the consequences for me
with the boys, my teacher,

01:15:18.027 --> 01:15:20.692
back at the time,
were gonna be terrible.

01:15:25.095 --> 01:15:26.892
Are you gonna
miss your flight?

01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:30.758
You know, we can do the rest
by email, if you'd like.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.758
No, don't worry.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.925
It's fine.

01:15:33.927 --> 01:15:35.927
How much do I owe you
for that smile?

01:15:35.929 --> 01:15:36.993
Piss off!

01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.693
Can somebody call
an ambulance?

01:15:38.695 --> 01:15:40.426
I'm sorry, excuse me.

01:15:40.428 --> 01:15:42.692
Is there... is there a
doctor on this flight?

01:15:42.694 --> 01:15:44.693
I'm reporting
unusual behavior.

01:15:44.695 --> 01:15:46.491
This is the first
signs of a stroke.

01:15:46.493 --> 01:15:48.858
Audrey, look at me.
Are you smelling burnt toast?

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.959
Are you OK?

01:15:51.861 --> 01:15:54.393
All right,
back to business.

01:15:54.395 --> 01:15:55.826
Back to business.

01:15:55.828 --> 01:15:58.359
So, what happened then?

01:16:19.061 --> 01:16:23.525
You guys are visiting
the retirement home today.

01:16:23.527 --> 01:16:28.427
And I read in your agenda that
you have to be formally dressed.

01:16:31.094 --> 01:16:32.827
So let me help you.

01:16:50.694 --> 01:16:52.793
It'll be fun, Rupert.

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:56.824
Fun and healthy.

01:16:56.826 --> 01:16:59.925
You get to do something
nice for someone else,

01:16:59.927 --> 01:17:04.657
and it will give you a break
from all of this insanity.

01:17:04.659 --> 01:17:06.525
Feet!

01:17:07.928 --> 01:17:10.625
He said he never
wrote the letters.

01:17:10.627 --> 01:17:12.925
They're gonna kick my ass.

01:17:12.927 --> 01:17:15.924
They're all gonna
make fun of me.

01:17:15.926 --> 01:17:18.858
I wanna stay here
with you, Mom.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.591
Please don't do this to me.

01:17:21.593 --> 01:17:23.591
Please don't let me down.

01:17:23.593 --> 01:17:26.391
You are never to write
to that man again.

01:17:26.393 --> 01:17:27.658
Do you understand?

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.558
Whether it is true
or not, I don't...

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.825
It is true!

01:17:30.827 --> 01:17:33.559
Do you see what
he has done to you?

01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:35.759
He... he wrote you off
in a heartbeat,

01:17:35.761 --> 01:17:38.457
and he would do it
again if he needed to.

01:17:38.459 --> 01:17:41.392
And that's what this
entire business is about.

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.857
Look, I know you love this.

01:17:45.859 --> 01:17:49.858
But I need you to
come down to earth, OK?

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.391
Focus on your grades.

01:17:52.393 --> 01:17:54.324
You can make a girlfriend.

01:17:54.326 --> 01:17:56.458
- Or a boyfriend.
- Eww!

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.293
Rupert, you have to
forget about this.

01:18:01.693 --> 01:18:04.491
Today's audition could've
changed everything.

01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:09.657
For once, they're casting
an American film.

01:18:09.659 --> 01:18:13.091
Rupert, you can audition
again when school is over, OK?

01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:14.657
In the summer.

01:18:14.659 --> 01:18:17.592
You disappear for a few weeks,
you disappear forever.

01:18:20.459 --> 01:18:21.891
You did.

01:18:27.059 --> 01:18:28.824
I did.

01:18:30.025 --> 01:18:31.691
And it would be great

01:18:31.693 --> 01:18:35.359
if you didn't remind me
about that all the time.

01:18:37.359 --> 01:18:40.624
I know you think that
I have no ambition, Rupert,

01:18:40.626 --> 01:18:42.758
OK, and no strength.

01:18:44.026 --> 01:18:45.891
Are you happy?

01:18:47.559 --> 01:18:51.523
But if some kid makes fun of you
or touches you

01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:54.456
or... or some grownup mocks you,

01:18:54.458 --> 01:18:56.357
I...

01:18:56.359 --> 01:19:00.456
I will have to be that... that
boring woman who's so small

01:19:00.458 --> 01:19:02.457
and come and protect you, OK?

01:19:03.692 --> 01:19:06.089
I never was scared
of not succeeding

01:19:06.091 --> 01:19:08.323
or losing your father.

01:19:08.325 --> 01:19:12.258
But I will always be
afraid of seeing you hurt.

01:19:15.992 --> 01:19:18.424
And not today,
not tomorrow...

01:19:19.857 --> 01:19:23.723
probably not for
a very long time,

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:26.557
but one day,

01:19:26.559 --> 01:19:28.825
you're gonna
understand that, OK?

01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:52.557
<i>Good morning, Olga.
Hello, Catherine.</i>

01:19:52.559 --> 01:19:54.623
Timothy, Rodrigue, Kamal.

01:19:54.625 --> 01:19:56.824
- Celeste, nice dress!
- Thanks, Miss.

01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:59.758
Cedric, Giant Shark...

01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:06.457
Missing anyone?

01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:09.790
Where's Rupert?

01:20:09.792 --> 01:20:12.356
Rupert Donovan's missing!

01:20:13.692 --> 01:20:16.456
Cedric!
Warning number one.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:17.990
- Ah, come on!
- Rupert?

01:20:17.992 --> 01:20:20.992
Sarah! Sarah!

01:20:22.858 --> 01:20:24.622
Come here!

01:20:24.624 --> 01:20:26.022
Oh God!

01:20:28.092 --> 01:20:29.689
Oh my God!

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:31.922
Oh no, it's
absolutely fine.

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:36.323
Um, do you mind
if I come in?

01:20:37.358 --> 01:20:39.524
OK, sure. Why not?

01:20:46.024 --> 01:20:48.556
Rupert dropped this off
at school this morning.

01:20:48.558 --> 01:20:50.555
What?

01:20:50.557 --> 01:20:52.756
"Dear Miss Kureshi,
please don't worry.

01:20:52.758 --> 01:20:55.556
"I'm off to London
for an audition."

01:20:57.692 --> 01:21:00.825
I forbade him from going
to that audition, Miss Kureshi.

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:04.889
Miss Turner, I...

01:21:04.891 --> 01:21:07.788
I'm sure you did forbid him
to go, and I...

01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:11.322
I know!
I'm not stupid, OK, I just...

01:21:14.792 --> 01:21:17.789
Rupert's safe, right?
He has a cell phone, doesn't he?

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:20.023
- You can contact him...
- He wanted to.

01:21:20.025 --> 01:21:22.855
But he's... he's just a boy.

01:21:22.857 --> 01:21:24.955
He... he knows
the city, though.

01:21:24.957 --> 01:21:28.323
He visits his father
once a month by himself.

01:21:28.325 --> 01:21:29.989
Well, he...

01:21:30.992 --> 01:21:32.654
He used to.

01:21:32.656 --> 01:21:36.755
OK, well, I have a conference
in Bracknell this afternoon,

01:21:36.757 --> 01:21:39.056
so I'll have to
call his father,

01:21:39.058 --> 01:21:43.689
and he will put him on
the train back to Harrow.

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.089
- All right.
- Hmm!

01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:47.088
Thank you, Miss Kureshi.

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:48.954
Of course!

01:21:48.956 --> 01:21:52.622
Um, I'll... I'll see myself out.

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.957
- Miss Turner?
- Yes?

01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:01.488
Yes?

01:22:02.656 --> 01:22:05.722
I see Rupert,

01:22:05.724 --> 01:22:08.854
and he has such a brilliant
future ahead of him.

01:22:08.856 --> 01:22:10.355
You know?

01:22:10.357 --> 01:22:11.888
Which is more
than I can say

01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:14.488
for most of
the students I've taught.

01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:17.754
I mean, I can see
a future for them,

01:22:17.756 --> 01:22:20.689
but I rarely see a...

01:22:22.822 --> 01:22:24.020
destiny.

01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:32.321
And I guess that's why I came
here today instead of calling.

01:22:32.323 --> 01:22:35.487
Mm-hmm. Well, I... I know
my son is special, OK?

01:22:35.489 --> 01:22:37.856
I... I'm not blind.

01:22:47.856 --> 01:22:51.655
Rupert must be pretty ashamed
of me, isn't he?

01:22:51.657 --> 01:22:55.421
He's probably telling you
all sorts of things about me,

01:22:55.423 --> 01:22:56.922
isn't he,

01:22:56.924 --> 01:22:59.589
just mocking me
to all his friends.

01:23:01.524 --> 01:23:05.020
Rupert is a lonely child.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:08.723
He doesn't open up
much to others.

01:23:10.957 --> 01:23:13.956
Oh. OK.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.955
He... he...

01:23:17.955 --> 01:23:19.722
Well, he used to.

01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:24.554
I was going through
the children's homework

01:23:24.556 --> 01:23:25.920
the other night,

01:23:25.922 --> 01:23:29.054
and I realized you hadn't signed
this paper by Rupert,

01:23:29.056 --> 01:23:31.054
the one about role models.

01:23:31.056 --> 01:23:32.921
Well, Rupert's had
a correspondence

01:23:32.923 --> 01:23:36.588
with a 30-year-old man
for 5 years with nobody knowing,

01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:39.087
so I guess it's no surprise

01:23:39.089 --> 01:23:42.522
that he didn't wanna
share his essay with me.

01:23:58.089 --> 01:24:00.388
I can't understand why.

01:24:01.956 --> 01:24:03.389
Good day.

01:24:13.522 --> 01:24:16.821
<i>To choose your
mother or father as a role model</i>

01:24:16.823 --> 01:24:18.554
<i>is probably unoriginal,</i>

01:24:18.556 --> 01:24:21.788
<i>but I reckon there isn't
a person I know better,</i>

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:25.588
<i>nor admire more,
than my mother, Sam Turner.</i>

01:24:28.621 --> 01:24:30.554
<i>Over the past few years,</i>

01:24:30.556 --> 01:24:33.488
<i>her and I sort of
grew apart, but...</i>

01:24:35.355 --> 01:24:37.088
<i>you'll tell me that's life.</i>

01:24:46.955 --> 01:24:48.819
<i>Sam got pregnant with me,</i>

01:24:48.821 --> 01:24:51.721
<i>and my father left her
for another person shortly after</i>

01:24:51.723 --> 01:24:53.721
<i>and moved to England.</i>

01:24:53.723 --> 01:24:56.386
<i>So she raised me on her own.</i>

01:24:56.388 --> 01:25:00.019
<i>And for a while,
we were a pretty good match.</i>

01:25:00.021 --> 01:25:01.020
Excuse me!

01:25:01.022 --> 01:25:04.087
My son Rupert Turner had
an appointment at 1:30.

01:25:04.089 --> 01:25:08.587
<i>I would take care of her,
even call her "love,"</i>

01:25:08.589 --> 01:25:11.386
<i>which made me feel
like an adult.</i>

01:25:11.388 --> 01:25:15.585
<i>But the truth is
we were simply best friends.</i>

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:19.720
Rupert!

01:25:19.722 --> 01:25:22.454
<i>She called me Larry
instead of my real name,</i>

01:25:22.456 --> 01:25:24.720
<i>and we watched movies together.</i>

01:25:24.722 --> 01:25:27.652
<i>I think we've seen</i> The Secret
Garden <i>a billion times.</i>

01:25:27.654 --> 01:25:29.420
Rupert!

01:25:29.422 --> 01:25:31.352
<i>As she quit acting,</i>

01:25:31.354 --> 01:25:33.319
<i>I started to audition
for small parts.</i>

01:25:33.321 --> 01:25:34.621
Rupert!

01:25:34.623 --> 01:25:37.953
<i>I thought she'd be proud of me
for doing something</i>

01:25:37.955 --> 01:25:40.053
<i>she had once been
striving to do.</i>

01:25:40.055 --> 01:25:41.520
Rupert!

01:25:48.688 --> 01:25:50.486
<i>As the years went by,</i>

01:25:50.488 --> 01:25:53.552
<i>Sam became disappointed
with how her dreams faded,</i>

01:25:53.554 --> 01:25:55.919
<i>and we moved here
in search of new ones.</i>

01:25:58.355 --> 01:26:00.019
Excuse me, sir,
my son is there...

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:01.719
<i>It's been hard for me,</i>

01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:04.621
<i>but I understand why Sam needed
to become someone else.</i>

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:09.652
<i>It's just hard to admit I do.</i>

01:26:09.654 --> 01:26:12.718
<i>I know I'm responsible
for the distance between us.</i>

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.919
<i>Sometimes, I wish
all of our problems</i>

01:26:14.921 --> 01:26:18.853
<i>and the invisible wall
between us vanished,</i>

01:26:18.855 --> 01:26:21.585
<i>that it'd be just
the two of us again,</i>

01:26:21.587 --> 01:26:24.787
<i>with nothing else
to worry about,</i>

01:26:24.789 --> 01:26:26.785
<i>with no pride and no lies.</i>

01:26:26.787 --> 01:26:29.519
<i>Then I'd tell her the truth.</i>

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.619
<i>I'd tell her just
how much I love her.</i>

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.085
Mom!

01:27:02.688 --> 01:27:04.853
- I'm sorry!
- I'm so sorry!

01:27:04.855 --> 01:27:06.019
I'm stupid!

01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:07.818
- You're not mad?
- I'm so stupid.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.551
You're not stupid, Mom!

01:27:09.553 --> 01:27:11.718
Your teacher came.
I knew I'd made a mistake.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.052
- But then I read your essay.
- You did?

01:27:14.054 --> 01:27:15.818
I didn't wanna
hurt you, OK?

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:17.386
I didn't wanna hurt you,

01:27:17.388 --> 01:27:19.885
and I'm so sorry that
you think I'm small-minded.

01:27:19.887 --> 01:27:21.887
You're not!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:27:21.889 --> 01:27:23.519
We'll do it, OK?

01:27:23.521 --> 01:27:25.019
Rupy, you'll do it,
the acting.

01:27:25.021 --> 01:27:27.485
And I'm gonna be
there for you, OK?

01:27:27.487 --> 01:27:28.486
OK.

01:27:37.554 --> 01:27:40.518
<i>I think you knew
this was coming, didn't you?</i>

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.685
Barbara,
this can't be serious.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.620
We've been through
so much together.

01:27:46.622 --> 01:27:49.454
I need you, and...

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.286
Say it.

01:27:56.653 --> 01:27:58.619
I need you, John?

01:28:00.753 --> 01:28:03.320
I don't need anybody.

01:28:03.322 --> 01:28:06.518
That's a position I've been
avoiding putting myself in

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.285
for the past 40 years.

01:28:11.054 --> 01:28:13.253
John, darlin'...

01:28:14.521 --> 01:28:16.352
Look around you.

01:28:16.354 --> 01:28:19.385
Look at the art on the walls.
Look at the rug.

01:28:19.387 --> 01:28:21.686
Look at that chair
you're sitting in.

01:28:22.952 --> 01:28:24.719
I chose this life.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.419
Oh, it could've been different,

01:28:31.421 --> 01:28:33.019
much, much different.

01:28:34.087 --> 01:28:36.718
I could've done it all.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.085
You have no idea the
opportunities I turned down

01:28:40.087 --> 01:28:43.618
to work with extraordinary
actors, just artists,

01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:45.384
become a partner in agencies

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:47.785
you'd never imagine me
working in...

01:28:47.787 --> 01:28:49.817
I don't doubt you, Barbara...

01:28:49.819 --> 01:28:51.418
I'm not finished.

01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:57.384
I chose this life, John.

01:28:59.953 --> 01:29:01.784
Not for want of ambition.

01:29:01.786 --> 01:29:06.018
I like money and all the stuff
you can do with it. I do.

01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:10.483
But I chose this life
because it's the one I can live

01:29:10.485 --> 01:29:14.252
and in which I can feel
that I'm doing right by my job.

01:29:16.486 --> 01:29:19.583
I just can't manage the careers
of business people.

01:29:19.585 --> 01:29:22.685
It's not 'cause I don't
like 'em or respect 'em.

01:29:22.687 --> 01:29:25.451
I mean, I can be
around 'em and among 'em.

01:29:25.453 --> 01:29:27.652
But I can't be them.

01:29:30.686 --> 01:29:32.551
I'm not a liar.

01:29:35.819 --> 01:29:38.685
And if you're gonna be
that person, John...

01:29:39.985 --> 01:29:41.851
if you're gonna hire models

01:29:41.853 --> 01:29:44.984
to be seen with them
strolling out of restaurants

01:29:44.986 --> 01:29:47.017
and going to your charity balls,

01:29:47.019 --> 01:29:50.285
if you're gonna be the person
that dismisses people...

01:29:52.618 --> 01:29:54.851
tells kids they don't exist...

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.717
I won't go down
that road with you.

01:29:58.719 --> 01:30:00.751
That's a dead end,
and I know it.

01:30:04.851 --> 01:30:08.650
I'm not dumb.
I know you can do it.

01:30:08.652 --> 01:30:10.651
I'm sure you can do it.

01:30:11.652 --> 01:30:13.784
If that's what you want.

01:30:15.086 --> 01:30:17.684
But I'm not doing it with you.

01:30:20.018 --> 01:30:24.684
I've just seen too many friends
just get lost in that spiral,

01:30:24.686 --> 01:30:27.450
that bullshit black hole.

01:30:27.452 --> 01:30:28.850
It's just...

01:30:28.852 --> 01:30:32.083
It's just a waste of talent

01:30:32.085 --> 01:30:35.417
and time never redeemed.

01:30:45.552 --> 01:30:47.384
I'm finished.

01:30:50.386 --> 01:30:54.484
<i>Barbara, I have Eileen O'Neal
for you on line one.</i>

01:30:56.351 --> 01:30:58.783
You'll find yourself
another manager, Johnny.

01:30:58.785 --> 01:31:00.884
It's the best thing
for you right now.

01:31:00.886 --> 01:31:02.983
I'll tell everybody
that you fired me.

01:31:02.985 --> 01:31:04.618
Put her through, Melanie.

01:31:06.484 --> 01:31:08.985
What if I don't wanna change?

01:31:10.685 --> 01:31:12.815
That one's for your shrink.

01:31:12.817 --> 01:31:15.317
Eileen, how are you?

01:31:15.319 --> 01:31:17.615
I know, I know!
I've been meaning to call.

01:31:17.617 --> 01:31:20.349
I've been so busy.
Things are just great!

01:31:21.917 --> 01:31:23.783
How are the kids?

01:31:23.785 --> 01:31:25.650
Disney World?

01:31:28.486 --> 01:31:30.418
No, I'm good.

01:31:37.318 --> 01:31:39.016
No, I'm fine.

01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:06.982
Hey!

01:32:06.984 --> 01:32:08.650
Hey!

01:32:10.484 --> 01:32:12.017
Um...

01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:17.350
Shit, I'm sorry!
I should've called.

01:32:18.384 --> 01:32:20.015
It's OK.

01:32:20.017 --> 01:32:22.815
Um, they took the bus
up here for the weekend.

01:32:22.817 --> 01:32:26.416
I'm gonna drive them back home
for my brother's birthday.

01:32:26.418 --> 01:32:27.983
Wow, that's amazing!

01:32:27.985 --> 01:32:29.815
Cool.

01:32:29.817 --> 01:32:33.283
Uh, I suppose I could
come back later?

01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:36.482
I don't know if
they're staying,

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.882
but we could go for
a beer or something.

01:32:40.717 --> 01:32:42.649
Look, I, uh...

01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:45.249
I need to talk.

01:32:46.484 --> 01:32:48.416
To me?

01:32:51.319 --> 01:32:53.384
Well, yeah.

01:32:54.984 --> 01:32:57.548
Uh, no, silent...

01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:59.747
Look, I, uh...

01:32:59.749 --> 01:33:02.848
I think, um, this whole...

01:33:03.917 --> 01:33:05.883
John, I... I like you,

01:33:05.885 --> 01:33:09.250
but this... this whole story...

01:33:10.052 --> 01:33:13.315
this whole picture thing,

01:33:13.317 --> 01:33:15.782
it's just, I don't know.

01:33:15.784 --> 01:33:18.048
What, you're, uh,
you're ashamed?

01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:20.415
No, John.

01:33:21.451 --> 01:33:23.748
You are, though.

01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:26.382
- Rihanna.
- That was Rihanna!

01:33:26.384 --> 01:33:28.983
I wish you would've
picked up the phone.

01:33:30.351 --> 01:33:32.748
Listen, the timing
wasn't right.

01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:35.314
Look, it's fine. OK?

01:33:35.316 --> 01:33:37.847
Honey, come on!
Connor needs you!

01:33:37.849 --> 01:33:39.515
Hold on one second, Mom.

01:33:39.517 --> 01:33:42.748
Sorry, just one minute.

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:45.949
Look, you gotta
do what you gotta do, you know?

01:33:48.483 --> 01:33:50.982
I... I'm...

01:33:50.984 --> 01:33:53.015
I'm young.

01:33:53.017 --> 01:33:55.947
And I... I know
what I want

01:33:55.949 --> 01:33:58.383
and who I am.

01:34:00.449 --> 01:34:02.781
And being someone's
secret crush

01:34:02.783 --> 01:34:05.615
is just nowhere near
where I'm headed.

01:34:05.617 --> 01:34:07.382
OK?

01:34:07.384 --> 01:34:10.448
Um, I'd let you in, but...

01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:12.549
Singer? Singing?

01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:16.747
Big boobs?
Dolly Parton!

01:34:17.782 --> 01:34:19.548
It's fine.

01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:22.482
I'm sorry.

01:34:36.516 --> 01:34:38.748
<i>I sent him
a copy of the book,</i>

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:40.981
<i>but never heard back
from Will Jefford Jr.</i>

01:34:40.983 --> 01:34:43.980
<i>John had mentioned him in
the letters, always lovingly,</i>

01:34:43.982 --> 01:34:45.714
<i>but no one really seems to know</i>

01:34:45.716 --> 01:34:47.815
<i>where Will lives now
or what he does.</i>

01:34:47.817 --> 01:34:49.048
<i>Hmm...</i>

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:51.315
<i>Word is he's moved back home</i>

01:34:51.317 --> 01:34:53.713
<i>and does pretty much
everything except act.</i>

01:34:53.715 --> 01:34:54.947
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:34:54.949 --> 01:34:58.846
<i>Barbara Haggermaker once
said in an interview,</i>

01:34:58.848 --> 01:35:00.947
<i>one of those
Women of Power pieces,</i>

01:35:00.949 --> 01:35:03.881
<i>that her greatest failure
wasn't dropping John.</i>

01:35:03.883 --> 01:35:04.880
<i>No?</i>

01:35:04.882 --> 01:35:06.681
<i>It was not knowing him.</i>

01:35:10.016 --> 01:35:12.548
<i>When his illness, his past,</i>

01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:15.080
<i>when everything about him
was revealed,</i>

01:35:15.082 --> 01:35:17.381
<i>a lot of people felt that way.</i>

01:35:18.915 --> 01:35:21.680
<i>But what should we know
of an artist?</i>

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:26.014
<i>What should
he reveal of himself,</i>

01:35:26.016 --> 01:35:28.848
<i>and why does it matter to us?</i>

01:35:48.648 --> 01:35:50.881
<i>So, what became of John?</i>

01:35:57.781 --> 01:36:00.813
<i>He just... disappeared.</i>

01:36:04.749 --> 01:36:06.414
<i>They sold the apartment.</i>

01:36:06.416 --> 01:36:09.546
<i>I think he just went back
to the life he once had</i>

01:36:09.548 --> 01:36:11.013
<i>not that long ago.</i>

01:36:12.549 --> 01:36:14.813
Hellsome High
<i>had Adam White leave</i>

01:36:14.815 --> 01:36:17.779
<i>on a spiritual journey
somewhere in Africa</i>

01:36:17.781 --> 01:36:19.647
<i>in the middle of Season 6.</i>

01:36:21.015 --> 01:36:22.879
<i>I remember the episode.
It was...</i>

01:36:22.881 --> 01:36:24.880
<i>It was called "Departure."</i>

01:36:24.882 --> 01:36:26.580
<i>Ah! That's fitting.</i>

01:36:28.381 --> 01:36:32.247
<i>The man John had attacked on
set pressed charges, of course.</i>

01:36:33.749 --> 01:36:36.881
<i>They settled. No one ever
heard about it again.</i>

01:36:39.013 --> 01:36:41.913
<i>Did he write during
these months of...</i>

01:36:41.915 --> 01:36:44.314
<i>What was it? Do you know?</i>

01:36:44.316 --> 01:36:47.347
<i>Isolation? Addiction?
Depression?</i>

01:36:47.349 --> 01:36:48.814
<i>I wouldn't know because, no,</i>

01:36:48.816 --> 01:36:51.414
<i>he didn't write during
that period of time.</i>

01:36:51.416 --> 01:36:54.681
<i>I mean, I wish I could've
been there for John.</i>

01:36:57.047 --> 01:37:00.346
<i>But we were miles...
We were worlds away.</i>

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:03.981
<i>Life went on.</i>

01:37:06.847 --> 01:37:09.379
<i>And John,
he'd kept his old habit</i>

01:37:09.381 --> 01:37:12.779
<i>of eating in the kitchen
of that diner he fancied</i>

01:37:12.781 --> 01:37:15.647
<i>and from which
he'd so often written me.</i>

01:37:17.782 --> 01:37:20.447
<i>He hadn't completely lost touch.</i>

01:37:23.314 --> 01:37:25.313
<i>After the London saga,</i>

01:37:25.315 --> 01:37:28.047
<i>my mom had allowed me
to start auditioning again,</i>

01:37:28.049 --> 01:37:30.746
<i>and a sort of serendipitous
series of events</i>

01:37:30.748 --> 01:37:31.812
<i>and a wide casting</i>

01:37:31.814 --> 01:37:34.013
<i>had gotten me a callback
in New York.</i>

01:37:35.747 --> 01:37:37.611
<i>Of course, I was thrilled,</i>

01:37:37.613 --> 01:37:40.945
<i>but mainly because,
as we had planned,</i>

01:37:40.947 --> 01:37:43.980
<i>I'd be meeting John
for the very first time.</i>

01:37:45.614 --> 01:37:47.445
<i>The first time in 5 years.</i>

01:37:48.982 --> 01:37:50.778
That isn't...

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:52.512
<i>Hellsome High?</i>

01:37:52.514 --> 01:37:53.913
It is you, isn't it?

01:37:54.947 --> 01:37:56.544
Ha!

01:37:56.546 --> 01:37:59.812
I'm sorry. I know
that's not your name.

01:38:00.913 --> 01:38:02.713
No, that's, uh...

01:38:02.715 --> 01:38:04.944
That's a high school.
Um, my name is...

01:38:04.946 --> 01:38:07.012
John F. Donovan!

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.378
I'm not that old.

01:38:09.713 --> 01:38:11.513
I'm sure you hate this,

01:38:11.515 --> 01:38:14.546
but my grandson is
a huge fan of yours.

01:38:14.548 --> 01:38:18.413
I was walking with him down
Canal Street just the other day

01:38:18.415 --> 01:38:20.977
and passed a poster
for your show,

01:38:20.979 --> 01:38:23.311
and he just
got so excited.

01:38:24.681 --> 01:38:28.079
He stood in front of that
poster around 5 minutes.

01:38:28.081 --> 01:38:31.413
He wants to be just like
you when he grows up.

01:38:32.747 --> 01:38:35.078
Magic powers
included, of course.

01:38:36.712 --> 01:38:37.944
Does he?

01:38:37.946 --> 01:38:39.879
He sure does, yeah.

01:38:42.414 --> 01:38:46.345
Well, I don't mean to
bother you, you know.

01:38:46.347 --> 01:38:49.045
No, you're not. Please.

01:38:49.047 --> 01:38:52.412
Oh, aren't you
a kind man,

01:38:52.414 --> 01:38:55.379
sitting here trying to get
some peace and quiet,

01:38:55.381 --> 01:38:58.912
and an old fool like me
comes squawking in.

01:38:58.914 --> 01:39:00.644
No.

01:39:00.646 --> 01:39:02.945
No, really, it's...

01:39:02.947 --> 01:39:06.878
Well, we'll be waiting
for the next great adventure,

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.578
then, will we?

01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.913
- OK.
- I don't know, sir.

01:39:11.913 --> 01:39:13.744
What?

01:39:13.746 --> 01:39:15.845
I don't know anymore.

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:20.744
I, uh...

01:39:22.979 --> 01:39:24.645
I feel...

01:39:24.647 --> 01:39:27.846
Sorry, I... I feel like...

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:33.846
Talk to me.

01:39:35.881 --> 01:39:38.543
I... I feel...

01:39:38.545 --> 01:39:42.344
I've done
everything wrong.

01:39:42.346 --> 01:39:44.478
You know?

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.412
I've been thinking...

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:53.011
What if I...
What if I don't belong here?

01:39:53.013 --> 01:39:56.613
What if I've stolen
someone else's place?

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.679
Ah, Jesus, say something.
Laugh at me or...

01:40:01.681 --> 01:40:03.577
Oh dear!

01:40:03.579 --> 01:40:08.711
I mean, who am I to contemplate
these confessions, really?

01:40:08.713 --> 01:40:10.577
Hmm?

01:40:10.579 --> 01:40:12.944
I know, I know.
I'm s...

01:40:12.946 --> 01:40:14.644
I'm sorry. Please go.

01:40:14.646 --> 01:40:17.878
I should never have bothered you
with any of this.

01:40:19.012 --> 01:40:20.811
In my opinion...

01:40:22.578 --> 01:40:24.577
things are simple.

01:40:24.579 --> 01:40:27.711
People, on the other hand,

01:40:27.713 --> 01:40:32.778
have an inexplicable proclivity
to make them complicated.

01:40:35.745 --> 01:40:38.676
It seems to me
you already know you erred,

01:40:38.678 --> 01:40:42.377
which is, to say at least,
atypical of most people.

01:40:44.646 --> 01:40:48.476
But, personally,
I look at you,

01:40:48.478 --> 01:40:52.543
and all I see is a young man

01:40:52.545 --> 01:40:55.577
whose work matters
to my grandson.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:00.777
I mean, how you chose
to remedy your wrongs

01:41:00.779 --> 01:41:03.844
is yours and God's
good businesses.

01:41:05.612 --> 01:41:07.811
But the question is...

01:41:11.012 --> 01:41:13.811
how could you have
stolen a place...

01:41:16.313 --> 01:41:19.511
that was made just for you?

01:41:30.544 --> 01:41:34.445
Um, I'm sorry,
I've never seen you here before.

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.743
Well, you see me now.

01:41:40.944 --> 01:41:44.712
Blimey! You know,
I'd better get going.

01:41:47.711 --> 01:41:49.777
Go home.

01:41:49.779 --> 01:41:54.478
You're too young for lonely
meals in dingy kitchens.

01:42:14.411 --> 01:42:15.810
Mom!

01:42:19.777 --> 01:42:21.676
Wow!

01:42:23.312 --> 01:42:25.310
What are you doing here?

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:35.244
Well, then this is
the most perfect night.

01:42:40.844 --> 01:42:44.377
So, how's Amy?

01:42:50.544 --> 01:42:52.709
Is it, um,

01:42:52.711 --> 01:42:56.411
is it because you
met someone?

01:42:56.413 --> 01:42:59.645
Uh, another person?

01:43:05.743 --> 01:43:07.476
Oh, no, no, no!

01:43:07.478 --> 01:43:09.042
Don't do this to me.
No, come on!

01:43:09.044 --> 01:43:11.509
- No, I'm sorry.
- You're not gonna leave now!

01:43:11.511 --> 01:43:13.975
We're in the middle of a game!
Are you kidding me?

01:43:13.977 --> 01:43:16.475
Not like "I gotta bail"
I'm sorry.

01:43:16.477 --> 01:43:19.943
- John!
- Mom, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:43:19.945 --> 01:43:22.877
I'm... sorry.

01:43:27.376 --> 01:43:28.975
I don't know, I...

01:43:28.977 --> 01:43:31.443
Fuck, I'm not good at this!

01:43:33.643 --> 01:43:35.976
Um, you know, John,
that I, um...

01:43:37.943 --> 01:43:40.876
I read everything about you.

01:43:40.878 --> 01:43:43.841
I mean, everybody gives me
every article. Everything.

01:43:43.843 --> 01:43:45.642
I see every performance,

01:43:45.644 --> 01:43:47.976
all the talk shows,
your work, everything.

01:43:47.978 --> 01:43:49.908
I follow you and, um...

01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:53.510
There's this one thing
that you said.

01:43:53.512 --> 01:43:55.510
Oh, Ma, what did you read?

01:43:56.644 --> 01:43:59.641
You said it on
a few occasions.

01:43:59.643 --> 01:44:03.243
Um, you said that...

01:44:04.576 --> 01:44:06.376
You said that we...

01:44:07.644 --> 01:44:11.874
that we came from
different planets.

01:44:11.876 --> 01:44:14.008
- Oh no, Ma...
- And...

01:44:16.344 --> 01:44:18.441
John, I...

01:44:20.778 --> 01:44:23.443
I come from this planet...

01:44:25.043 --> 01:44:28.609
and you come...

01:44:30.776 --> 01:44:33.543
from me.

01:44:35.078 --> 01:44:37.609
And I know that, um...

01:44:37.611 --> 01:44:41.541
I mean, I don't think
a mother is supposed to be

01:44:41.543 --> 01:44:43.308
her son's friend.

01:44:47.777 --> 01:44:49.741
But I know you.

01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:54.707
I was the first to.

01:45:00.677 --> 01:45:03.342
So, now let's just
play cards, OK?

01:45:05.877 --> 01:45:07.409
Hey, Ma?

01:45:07.411 --> 01:45:09.707
Yeah.

01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:14.407
Would you run me a bath
and ask me to spell words...

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:17.342
...like we used to?

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:19.543
If that's what you want.

01:45:21.444 --> 01:45:24.674
Can I stay here tonight?

01:45:24.676 --> 01:45:27.974
Oh, honey, you can stay here
for the rest of your life.

01:45:34.076 --> 01:45:36.474
This is fun!

01:45:36.476 --> 01:45:38.440
Rupert, stop it!

01:45:38.442 --> 01:45:39.908
Mom, you should try this!

01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:42.774
Stop jumping on the bed.
You're gonna break the bed.

01:45:42.776 --> 01:45:45.706
You're gonna break the floor.
You're gonna break your neck!

01:45:45.708 --> 01:45:46.906
I don't know a human being

01:45:46.908 --> 01:45:49.007
capable of drying their hair
in blue light.

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:50.474
You see how high I can go?

01:45:51.943 --> 01:45:53.606
Do you wanna go back
to England?

01:46:01.443 --> 01:46:03.408
- Mom?
- Yeah?

01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:05.774
Do you think John's
answered my letter yet?

01:46:05.776 --> 01:46:08.306
The front desk said
that they'd call.

01:46:08.308 --> 01:46:11.873
You have to focus on
the positive stuff, honey.

01:46:14.442 --> 01:46:15.541
Yeah.

01:46:15.543 --> 01:46:17.540
It's a full moon tonight.

01:46:17.542 --> 01:46:19.641
It's gotta mean
something, right?

01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:26.874
I guess so.

01:46:26.876 --> 01:46:29.640
<i>It will be hard
to entirely ignore</i>

01:46:29.642 --> 01:46:32.074
this mother-son hotbox
on my MySpace.

01:46:32.076 --> 01:46:34.474
This one seems
like a good one.

01:46:34.476 --> 01:46:36.807
"Prandrial"?
Oh God, what's that?

01:46:36.809 --> 01:46:38.407
"Preprandial."

01:46:38.409 --> 01:46:39.773
That's easy.

01:46:39.775 --> 01:46:44.674
P-R-E-P-R-A-N-D-I-A-L.

01:46:44.676 --> 01:46:47.539
Uh, pertaining to something
before a meal.

01:46:47.541 --> 01:46:49.141
You are such a nerd.

01:46:53.008 --> 01:46:54.907
Is that right?

01:46:54.909 --> 01:46:57.640
Sorry, what?

01:46:57.642 --> 01:46:59.608
What, that's how
you spell it.

01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:00.773
Is that right?

01:47:00.775 --> 01:47:04.407
Oh yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:11.441 --> 01:47:13.374
Honey, are you OK?

01:47:15.641 --> 01:47:17.307
I'm fine, Ma.

01:47:17.309 --> 01:47:18.707
Yeah?

01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:20.408
I'm fine.

01:47:21.941 --> 01:47:25.738
Things are gonna be a bit
different, that's all.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.673
Yeah, it's a little scary,

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:31.640
but, you know, you just...

01:47:33.342 --> 01:47:35.673
You just have
to be yourself.

01:47:35.675 --> 01:47:39.472
Eek!
Well, that'll be terrible!

01:47:40.676 --> 01:47:42.539
Shut up, you little fuck!

01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:44.639
What the fuck?
Don't be a dick, man!

01:47:44.641 --> 01:47:46.938
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh! Watch it, boys!

01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:48.606
Turn it up.

01:47:48.608 --> 01:47:50.438
- Piss off!
- I fucking love this song!

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.806
- Are you fucking serious?
- I know that one!

01:47:52.808 --> 01:47:54.906
I'm serious!
It's a great song! Turn it up!

01:47:54.908 --> 01:47:56.072
Ready for this?

01:47:58.908 --> 01:48:02.373
âªâª Desperate for changing âª

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.837
âª Starving for truth âª

01:48:06.341 --> 01:48:09.906
âª I'm closer to when I started âª

01:48:09.908 --> 01:48:13.940
âª I'm chasing after you âª

01:48:15.975 --> 01:48:19.805
âª I'm falling even more
in love with you âª

01:48:19.807 --> 01:48:23.039
âª Letting go of all
I've held on to âª

01:48:23.041 --> 01:48:24.073
You guys!

01:48:24.075 --> 01:48:27.838
âª I'm standing here
until you make me move âª

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.040
âª I'm hanging by a moment
here with you âª

01:48:32.042 --> 01:48:35.438
âª I'm living for
the only thing I know âª

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.906
âª I'm running and
I'm not sure where to go âª

01:48:39.908 --> 01:48:43.073
âª I don't know what
I'm diving into âª

01:48:43.075 --> 01:48:45.708
âª Just hanging by a moment... âªâª

01:49:09.707 --> 01:49:11.871
<i>I guess that's...</i>

01:49:11.873 --> 01:49:15.472
<i>I mean, my story pretty much
ends here, Audrey. I mean...</i>

01:49:15.474 --> 01:49:17.039
<i>Does it, now?</i>

01:49:17.041 --> 01:49:20.272
<i>Well, from what
Grace Donovan told me...</i>

01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:23.905
<i>That was the last time
she and Jimmy,</i>

01:49:23.907 --> 01:49:26.039
<i>and anybody,
as far as they know,</i>

01:49:26.041 --> 01:49:27.206
<i>saw John.</i>

01:49:29.473 --> 01:49:34.904
<i>Well, then, if I may ask
one final question...</i>

01:49:34.906 --> 01:49:36.804
<i>How did you find out?</i>

01:49:39.607 --> 01:49:41.239
Yes?

01:49:42.474 --> 01:49:44.340
Oh!

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:47.638
Oh!

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.971
OK!

01:49:48.973 --> 01:49:52.804
Uh, well, yes,
then... then send it up.

01:49:52.806 --> 01:49:56.539
Sorry! I just didn't want my son
to see the letter just yet.

01:49:56.541 --> 01:49:58.306
Otherwise, he'll go mental.

01:49:58.308 --> 01:50:02.672
Uh, is it
from Mr. Donovan?

01:50:02.674 --> 01:50:05.406
Um, no, I'm afraid
not, Miss Turner.

01:50:05.408 --> 01:50:06.771
A young man dropped it

01:50:06.773 --> 01:50:09.938
with the only instruction
to give it to Rupert Turner.

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.605
Oh! OK.

01:50:12.607 --> 01:50:14.604
My apologies.

01:50:14.606 --> 01:50:15.671
No, no, no!

01:50:15.673 --> 01:50:16.671
Sorry.

01:50:16.673 --> 01:50:18.705
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

01:50:58.706 --> 01:51:00.603
<i>"Dear Rupert,</i>

01:51:00.605 --> 01:51:03.605

some time to do that...</i>

<i>"But some lies are some

01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:01.939
<i>"And some lies, I think,
are a pure beauty.</i>

01:52:05.039 --> 01:52:08.004
<i>"But you are too pure

01:52:09.505 --> 01:52:11.903

01:52:38.339 --> 01:52:40.469

<i>"the greatest of our
achievements in this friendship</i>

01:52:47.872 --> 01:52:52.737

John, it's me!

01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:14.971
<i>"But for now...</i>

01:53:18.671 --> 01:53:20.503

01:53:25.672 --> 01:53:28.337
<i>"I just want to sleep</i>

<i>"Your friend, John."</i>

01:54:07.406 --> 01:54:10.835
After all this, um,

01:54:10.837 --> 01:54:15.802
I won't pretend that I'm not
curious to know if he...

01:54:19.571 --> 01:54:21.837
If he killed himself?

01:54:24.469 --> 01:54:27.335
We'll never really know,
will we?

01:54:27.337 --> 01:54:31.367
Um, and I don't know anything
more than what's in those pages.

01:54:31.369 --> 01:54:34.468
Well, either
he did kill himself

01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:38.369
because he'd sunk into a deep
despair, et cetera, et cetera...

01:54:39.837 --> 01:54:42.668
But that's the
easy version, isn't it?

01:54:43.937 --> 01:54:46.335
Or he really
did wanna sleep...

01:54:46.337 --> 01:54:48.637
and he made a terrible mistake.

01:54:49.737 --> 01:54:51.735
Because the last letter,

01:54:51.737 --> 01:54:53.967
it suggests that
he was full of hope.

01:54:53.969 --> 01:54:56.934
Which is why I'm sure
you will understand

01:54:56.936 --> 01:54:59.335
that, for obvious reasons,

01:54:59.337 --> 01:55:03.237
that is the version
that I chose to believe.

01:55:07.404 --> 01:55:08.401
Hmm!

01:55:08.403 --> 01:55:10.270
All right, Rupert.

01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:13.534
Thank you.

01:55:13.536 --> 01:55:15.669
I'm sorry we got off
to a bad start.

01:55:15.671 --> 01:55:20.036
No! Don't worry
about it, really.

01:55:20.038 --> 01:55:21.968
- I'll get the bill.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:23.735
Oh, there's my ride.

01:55:23.737 --> 01:55:25.602
- Go! Go!
- OK.

01:55:33.437 --> 01:55:34.534
Good luck.

01:55:34.536 --> 01:55:36.302
Ah, it's only one scene.

01:55:36.304 --> 01:55:38.600
No, I mean,
not today, obviously,

01:55:38.602 --> 01:55:43.368
but I mean with
your career, your life.

01:55:44.736 --> 01:55:47.369
I hope you get
what you want.

01:55:47.371 --> 01:55:49.336
I already have
what I want.

01:55:49.338 --> 01:55:51.470
Then good!

01:55:52.836 --> 01:55:54.768
All right, um...

01:55:55.903 --> 01:55:57.801
Oh!

01:56:01.503 --> 01:56:04.668
Um, I'll see ya.
