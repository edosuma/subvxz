00:02.167 --> 00:04.603
Everybody knows
super bowl Sunday

00:04.604 --> 00:07.171
Is the holiest day of the year.

00:07.172 --> 00:09.240
Come on, al. Three steps back,
go wide. Come on, buddy.

00:12.812 --> 00:14.479
Nice catch.

00:14.480 --> 00:17.248
How many times do
I have to tell you
that is not funny?

00:17.249 --> 00:19.283
Couple more, maybe.

00:19.284 --> 00:21.686
We all know that
super bowl Sunday's

00:21.687 --> 00:25.023
Not just about throwing
a ball at al's chest,
although I love doing that.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.425
It's also about
stuffing your face
in front of a tv.

00:27.426 --> 00:30.095
That's right.
Here to tell us
about that

00:30.096 --> 00:33.364
Are three players from
the detroit lions with their
favorite super bowl recipes.

00:33.365 --> 00:36.501
At linebacker,
6'1", 240 pounds,

00:36.502 --> 00:40.171
Sporting
a tuna noodle
casserole,

00:40.172 --> 00:42.674
Let's give a big hand
for chris spielman.

00:46.445 --> 00:48.079
Hey, chris.
Al.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.953
At quarterback,
6'1", 200 pounds,

00:54.954 --> 00:58.556
Carrying a south-of-the-border
seven-layer bean dip -

00:58.557 --> 00:59.991
Dave krieg!

00:59.992 --> 01:02.226
<i>Olé, dave!</i>

01:07.432 --> 01:11.102
And certainly last
but not the smallest,

01:11.103 --> 01:14.839
Defensive end,
280 pounds, 6'4",

01:14.840 --> 01:20.011
With a secret super bowl stew -
kelvin pritchett. Come on out.

01:27.019 --> 01:30.621
And wearing a nice throw rug,
I might add.

01:34.126 --> 01:37.696
You guys, it's
nice you took time out
to bring some recipes in.

01:37.697 --> 01:41.232
And maybe one of these years,
you'll get the recipe
for the super bowl.

01:43.069 --> 01:45.070
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:45.071 --> 01:48.840
I... I don't know.
Al made me say it.

01:48.841 --> 01:51.710
I... I did not.
I did not.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.746
Ok. Kelvin, can you
give the audience

01:54.747 --> 01:57.115
Just an example
of some of the ingredients

01:57.116 --> 01:59.250
In your supersecret
super bowl stew?

01:59.251 --> 02:02.653
The two main ingredients
are oysters and spam.

02:02.654 --> 02:03.822
Mmm...

02:07.993 --> 02:11.262
Well, I guess the secret
is why anybody'd want to
taste that combination.

02:12.664 --> 02:14.465
Sorry, pritch.

02:16.401 --> 02:19.604
How many does that serve,
kelvin?
One.

02:22.407 --> 02:24.776
So, chris,
why don't you tell us

02:24.777 --> 02:27.311
Some of the ingredients
in your tuna casserole?

02:27.312 --> 02:30.882
Well, tim,
I only use the finest
white-chunk albacore

02:30.883 --> 02:34.452
Packed in
fresh spring water.

02:34.453 --> 02:36.487
Well, perhaps
you complement it

02:36.488 --> 02:38.589
With maybe
a special type
of gourmet cheese?

02:38.590 --> 02:41.659
Uh, yes, I do.
The cheese in a spray can.

02:44.296 --> 02:49.734
Ok. Dave, how spicy is that
bean dip of yours, buddy?

02:49.735 --> 02:52.503
It's not too spicy
at all.

02:52.504 --> 02:54.505
<i>(talks with mouth full)</i>
it's got a...

03:04.049 --> 03:06.050
Uh, sorry, I lied.

03:06.051 --> 03:09.888
Think of it
as a quarterback sneak.

03:09.889 --> 03:11.890
Well, joking aside, guys...

03:11.891 --> 03:15.193
Who's gonna come out on top
this Sunday?

03:15.194 --> 03:17.262
No contest. My stew
by three helpings.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.264
No way. Your stew
can't handle my tuna.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.465
My beans'll blow you
both out of the water.

03:21.466 --> 03:25.136
<i>(all talk at once)</i>

03:25.137 --> 03:27.172
It's teamwork like this

03:27.173 --> 03:30.374
That guarantees the lions'll
never be in the super bowl.

03:30.375 --> 03:33.444
We'll be right back
after these words
from binford tools.

04:24.763 --> 04:26.831
Hey, dad.
Brad.

04:26.832 --> 04:31.336
Uh-oh. A ladder,
exposed wires and dad.

04:33.505 --> 04:36.774
No good can come
from this.

04:36.775 --> 04:39.210
I'm just hooking up
my surround-sound speakers

04:39.211 --> 04:41.212
For my super bowl party.

04:41.213 --> 04:44.648
We're gonna go to jeremy's
and watch it on his new
70-inch big screen.

04:44.649 --> 04:48.052
Big deal. You're missing
some great food.

04:48.053 --> 04:50.054
Larry's bringing
a three-cheese pizza,

04:50.055 --> 04:52.723
Harry's bringing
those big sausages,

04:52.724 --> 04:56.294
And pete's bringing nachos
with extra cream cheese.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.065
Who's bringing
the cardiologist?

05:03.135 --> 05:07.005
Dad, dad,
you better come see mom.
She doesn't look so good.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.440
Well, then why would I
want to go see her?

05:10.776 --> 05:14.078
Because she's moaning real loud
and calling your name.

05:14.079 --> 05:17.448
That's always been
a dream of mine.

05:26.158 --> 05:28.592
Honey?

05:28.593 --> 05:31.695
<i>(muffled)</i> tim,
I think I'm dying.

05:31.696 --> 05:33.231
<i>(mimics jill)</i> jill,
I can't understand -

05:33.232 --> 05:36.367
<i>(gibberish)</i>

05:36.368 --> 05:38.937
Oh, my god, it's 103.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.004
Ooh.

05:40.005 --> 05:42.706
Just threw up
last night's lasagna.

05:42.707 --> 05:46.544
Boy, it tastes bad
coming up.

05:46.545 --> 05:50.348
Didn't taste all that good
going down.

05:54.753 --> 05:57.422
Thanks a lot.

05:57.423 --> 06:00.691
Honey, I know how important
this super bowl party thing
is to you,

06:00.692 --> 06:04.462
But I'm really gonna need you
to take care of me today.

06:04.463 --> 06:05.696
Ok.

06:05.697 --> 06:07.865
Um... Just use
the intercom.

06:07.866 --> 06:11.602
Call me, and I'll come up
during commercials.

06:12.604 --> 06:15.039
Let me rephrase that.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.942
I don't want you to have
the party today.

06:17.943 --> 06:20.911
I've been planning this
for a long time.
It's a tradition.

06:20.912 --> 06:22.646
Never had one before.

06:22.647 --> 06:26.284
Well, traditions
start someplace.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.854
Tim, I have
a temperature of 103.

06:29.855 --> 06:33.491
According to a thermometer.

06:34.726 --> 06:36.927
Look, I'm burning up,
I feel horrible,

06:36.928 --> 06:40.198
I don't want a bunch of guys
over here making noise.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.300
Look, I'll take care
of you. Um...

06:42.301 --> 06:44.302
You're not gonna
take care of me..

06:44.303 --> 06:46.871
You're gonna be down there
the whole time.
I'll never even see you.

06:46.872 --> 06:48.506
I'll show you.

06:48.507 --> 06:50.541
I'll keep those guys so quiet,
you won't know they're here.

06:50.542 --> 06:54.178
Please, please, please?

06:54.179 --> 06:56.714
Oh, have your stupid party.

06:56.715 --> 06:58.716
Thanks.

06:58.717 --> 07:01.986
Whew...
You are hot.

07:05.857 --> 07:07.858
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

07:11.296 --> 07:12.563
<i>(blows horn)</i>

07:12.564 --> 07:14.565
Tim, it's gonna be
a great game.

07:14.566 --> 07:16.567
Those niners
are gonna kick butt!

07:16.568 --> 07:18.769
Hello, tim.
Hi, tim. Hello, tim.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.771
We gotta keep it down, guys.

07:20.772 --> 07:23.408
Good idea. Save our tooting
for the game.

07:23.409 --> 07:26.177
Maybe we keep our tooting
to ourselves.

07:26.178 --> 07:27.945
What are you talking about?

07:27.946 --> 07:31.715
Well, maybe when
there's a big play,
we all act like mimes.

07:31.716 --> 07:33.617
What?

07:35.054 --> 07:36.720
You know, I love mimes,

07:36.721 --> 07:38.956
Especially when they get caught
in that box.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.194
Al, stay in the box, will you?

07:43.195 --> 07:48.166
<i>(jill) tim? I think</i>
<i>I'm gonna throw up.</i>

07:48.167 --> 07:49.800
Is jill sick?

07:49.801 --> 07:52.970
No. She just doesn't
like mimes.

07:52.971 --> 07:55.806
You're having us
over for a party
when jill's sick?

07:55.807 --> 07:58.409
Is she ok with that?
That's not very considerate.

07:58.410 --> 08:02.080
Yeah. How are we supposed
to have a good time
if we can't make any noise?

08:02.081 --> 08:04.148
We could all have
gone over to harry's.

08:04.149 --> 08:06.417
No, we couldn't.
She wouldn't let me go.

08:06.418 --> 08:09.587
So because of you,

08:09.588 --> 08:13.657
We all have to mime our way
through the super bowl?

08:13.658 --> 08:16.060
It's not that bad
a deal. Come on.

08:16.061 --> 08:18.796
We got lots of good food,
we're all together.

08:18.797 --> 08:20.798
It's gonna be a great game.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

08:20.799 --> 08:24.402
Yeah, but what about
the surround sound
you promised us?

08:24.403 --> 08:26.237
You want real surround sound?

08:26.238 --> 08:29.474
Sit between these
two guys after a couple
of sausages. Whoo.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.542
<i>(horns blow)</i>

08:31.543 --> 08:34.611
<i>(super bowl plays on tv/</i>
<i>all yell)</i>

08:34.613 --> 08:37.615
Yeah!
All right!

08:37.616 --> 08:39.917
<i>(cheering)</i>

08:39.918 --> 08:42.153
<i>(jill) tim! Hey, tim,</i>

08:42.154 --> 08:45.223
<i>It's getting really noisy</i>
<i>down there.</i>

08:45.224 --> 08:46.991
Yeah, yeah.
All right, yeah.

08:46.992 --> 08:49.393
Guys, I told you, you got
to keep it down. Please?

08:49.394 --> 08:52.763
Well, tim, he just
broke three tackles.
We're very excited.

08:52.764 --> 08:55.166
Ok! When you get
excited now, do this.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.869
<i>(silent cheer)</i>

08:58.870 --> 09:01.105
I feel very uncomfortable
about having a party

09:01.106 --> 09:03.474
While jill's upstairs
with the stomach flu.

09:03.475 --> 09:05.576
Yeah, I'm sick
about it myself.

09:05.577 --> 09:07.411
Toss me another sausage,
will you?

09:07.412 --> 09:09.413
With your heart condition,

09:09.414 --> 09:12.350
Wouldn't you rather have some
of my raw vegetable medley?

09:12.351 --> 09:16.320
It's very good with this
nonfat dip. Come on.

09:16.321 --> 09:20.291
Yeah, that's all I want -
a little dip from a big dip.

09:20.292 --> 09:24.195
Come on. Larry, would you
talk some sense into him?
You're a doctor.

09:24.196 --> 09:30.000
I'm a neurosurgeon. As long
as he doesn't put the sausage
on his head, I don't care.

09:30.001 --> 09:32.002
<i>(♪ "lara's theme" from</i>
<i>"doctor zhivago" plays on tv)</i>

09:38.977 --> 09:42.547
What are you watching?
Oh, it's <i>doctor winnebago,</i>
isn't it?

09:45.850 --> 09:47.652
It's "zhivago."

09:47.653 --> 09:51.589
Look what I made for you.
Jell-o with extra wobble.

09:51.590 --> 09:54.925
I'm too woozy for wobbling.

09:54.926 --> 09:58.196
You just womited,
didn't you?

09:58.197 --> 10:00.198
This'll help
settle your stomach.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.200
Honey, I can't.
I can't eat.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.768
You gotta eat something.
I get credit for trying.

10:04.769 --> 10:06.604
If you need
anything else, holler.

10:06.605 --> 10:10.040
Would you give me a backrub?
A what rub?

10:12.010 --> 10:15.346
I always
have time to give my wife
a backrub. Hold on a minute.

10:15.347 --> 10:17.881
Yo, anybody?
<i>(pete) yo, tim.</i>

10:17.882 --> 10:20.918
Yeah, how much time I got?

10:20.919 --> 10:24.255
<i>I figure ten seconds.</i>
Got ya.

10:24.256 --> 10:27.525
You said even though you were
having those guys over,
you'd still take care of me.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.727
I am taking care of you.

10:29.728 --> 10:33.664
Oh, that's good.
You have such great hands.

10:33.665 --> 10:37.101
<i>(larry) oh, no!</i>
<i>(benny) he coughed it up!</i>

10:38.169 --> 10:40.904
Tim! Where are you going?

10:40.905 --> 10:43.741
Somebody coughed
something up downstairs.

10:43.742 --> 10:45.576
Tim! Tim...

10:45.577 --> 10:48.379
It could be harry.
He might be having
another heart attack.

10:48.380 --> 10:52.149
<i>(al)</i> all right! Hey!
He recovered.

10:52.150 --> 10:55.185
It's ok. Thank god,
harry's all right.
Talk to you later.

10:57.589 --> 10:59.790
Get him, get him!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10:59.791 --> 11:03.694
<i>(cheering)</i>

11:03.695 --> 11:06.063
Every time.
What did I miss?

11:06.064 --> 11:09.867
Oh, a fumble.
But then only the catch
of the year, tim!

11:09.868 --> 11:12.136
Aw, man.
They're on the 20-yard line
and driving.

11:12.137 --> 11:15.239
Hey, hey, tim, come on. Can we
put on the surround sound?

11:15.240 --> 11:18.008
No, no. I talked to you
about my wife.
Come on, guys.

11:18.009 --> 11:22.813
<i>(jill) tim? Tim, can you</i>
<i>bring me some more tissues?</i>

11:24.716 --> 11:28.118
Why can't she blow her nose
on the top sheet
like everybody else does?

11:29.321 --> 11:31.822
He's going all the way!
Get it! Get it!

11:31.823 --> 11:33.924
Oh!

11:33.925 --> 11:37.328
Hey, benny, turn on
the surround sound
just for the touchdown.

11:37.329 --> 11:38.596
Not too loud.

11:38.597 --> 11:41.666
Is this the one?

11:43.769 --> 11:46.737
Hey, benny!

11:46.738 --> 11:49.840
Let me guess.
You hooked it up yourself?

11:49.841 --> 11:53.177
Where's it on tv?
Tim, we need a tv.

11:53.178 --> 11:54.679
<i>(tim)</i> yeah...

11:54.680 --> 11:56.681
There's gotta
be one upstairs.

11:56.682 --> 11:59.517
Let's go!
Wait, wait, wait.
I can fix this.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.952
Right!

12:04.323 --> 12:07.391
Jill, sorry
to inconvenience you.

12:07.392 --> 12:11.261
We're at a critical juncture
in the game.

12:11.262 --> 12:14.231
Could we just
use your remote?

12:14.232 --> 12:17.167
Come on, you guys, listen.
Jill, we're - would you -

12:17.168 --> 12:20.070
Wait a minute. This is where
omar sharif proposes.

12:20.071 --> 12:22.340
Give me that.
Change the channel.

12:22.341 --> 12:25.609
Come on, my wife -
turn it off.
They're about to score.

12:25.610 --> 12:28.145
Tim? May I please
speak to you under here?

12:28.146 --> 12:32.182
Guys, after this,
we're getting out of here.

12:32.183 --> 12:35.953
Hi, honey.
Why are these men
in my bedroom?

12:35.954 --> 12:37.955
They don't wanna miss
a touchdown.

12:37.956 --> 12:40.358
Why don't they
watch it downstairs?
Now, that's a funny story...

12:40.359 --> 12:43.961
I don't want to hear
a funny story.

12:43.962 --> 12:47.398
You told me
that if they came over here,
I wouldn't have to see them.

12:47.399 --> 12:50.033
Can you see them?

12:50.034 --> 12:52.370
Touchdown!

12:52.371 --> 12:54.472
I missed the touch -
I missed everything.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.675
After the replay, we're
getting out of here, jill.

12:57.676 --> 13:00.611
Hey, jill, would you
like some hot sausage?

13:04.449 --> 13:06.684
It'll sweat the fever
right out of you.

13:08.854 --> 13:12.122
Jill, stay there. We're gonna
get everybody out of here.

13:12.123 --> 13:13.791
Honey? Honey?

13:13.792 --> 13:15.959
Honey?

13:15.960 --> 13:17.762
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

13:21.867 --> 13:24.769
Why didn't you just
cancel this party?

13:24.770 --> 13:27.371
Why couldn't you
just take care of me?

13:27.372 --> 13:29.973
Why do you always
do things like this?

13:29.974 --> 13:32.443
You ask interesting questions,
honey.

13:32.444 --> 13:35.613
What are your theories?
That you are an idiot.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.348
And I am a bigger idiot
for letting you talk me
into this stuff.

13:38.349 --> 13:41.485
Those guys only went upstairs
because our tv exploded.

13:41.486 --> 13:43.587
What are the chances
of that happening?

13:43.588 --> 13:45.623
In this house?

13:45.624 --> 13:49.527
I had everything
under control.
You are just so selfish!

13:49.528 --> 13:54.197
You only take care of me
when it doesn't interfere
with your schedule. Oh, god!

13:56.435 --> 13:58.101
That's not true.

13:58.102 --> 14:00.170
Yes, it is true.

14:00.171 --> 14:04.642
Well, how about when you went
to that hardware convention
and I had laryngitis?

14:04.643 --> 14:06.444
You never said anything.

14:08.346 --> 14:11.682
Well, what about when
I had my wisdom teeth out?

14:11.683 --> 14:14.652
I took care of you 100%.
You did not!

14:14.653 --> 14:18.088
Brad emptied my spit bucket.
Randy changed the gauze.

14:18.089 --> 14:20.891
Mark mashed my food.
What exactly did you do?

14:20.892 --> 14:22.726
Someone had to get
the <i>tv guide.</i>

14:22.727 --> 14:25.195
You're so pathetic!

14:25.196 --> 14:28.466
You know, you take better care
of your car than you do of me.

14:28.467 --> 14:32.202
Taking care of the car
is like taking care of you.
What if you were so sick I...?

14:32.203 --> 14:35.439
I am sick!

14:35.440 --> 14:40.310
And you know what?
I think that you resent me
for that. You do.

14:40.311 --> 14:42.312
I don't resent you for that.

14:42.313 --> 14:45.282
I just wonder why you get sick
on super bowl Sunday.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.454
Go, go, go!
Get him! Get him!

14:50.455 --> 14:53.991
All right, let's go.
We told jill we'd leave
after the first touchdown.

14:53.992 --> 14:56.059
We can't go now.
It's just getting exciting.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.261
No, you gotta go now.
Come on.

14:58.262 --> 15:00.263
Jill's gotta get back
in bed here, guys.

15:00.264 --> 15:03.601
All right, she can have the bed,
but we get the tv.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.403
This is not
a hostage situation.
Come on, guys.

15:06.404 --> 15:09.306
I know. We'll take the tv
and set it up downstairs.

15:09.307 --> 15:13.043
No, you won't. Come on.
She wants to watch the rest
of <i>doctor lumbago.</i>

15:13.044 --> 15:16.013
<i>Zhivago.</i>
<i>Doctor zhivago.</i>

15:16.014 --> 15:18.549
I got another tv.
We'll watch this thing
down in the den.

15:18.550 --> 15:22.119
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Are you nuts?

15:22.120 --> 15:24.254
You don't expect us to watch
the biggest game of the year

15:24.255 --> 15:27.224
On the world's
smallest tv, do ya?

15:27.225 --> 15:30.227
I'll have you know
the reception on here
is great.

15:30.228 --> 15:32.029
Look at this.
Huh? Huh?

15:32.030 --> 15:34.598
Look at the pass.
Look at that.

15:34.599 --> 15:37.735
Unbelievable.
He must have thrown the ball
a quarter of an inch.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.737
That's the end of the half.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.172
What do you say
we go over to big mike's,
watch the rest over there?

15:42.173 --> 15:45.910
Yeah, that's a great idea.
You can't go over there.
Hey...

15:45.911 --> 15:50.113
Pete, larry, harry,
you're not gonna leave me
here alone, are you?

15:50.114 --> 15:52.115
Listen, I'll stay.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.787
Nah, go ahead.

16:05.864 --> 16:09.366
Go! Go! Go!

16:09.367 --> 16:12.570
Touchdown!

16:12.571 --> 16:17.240
Who needs
a big-screen tv, huh?

16:17.241 --> 16:19.777
Three-fifty. I got...
I just need some batteries.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.179
Oh, come on, not now!

16:22.180 --> 16:24.982
Come on,
please, please, please.

16:30.088 --> 16:32.022
Yo, wilson.
You got any batteries?
Yo!

16:32.023 --> 16:36.026
Why, I certainly do, tim.
I got cs, ds. I got nine-volts.

16:36.027 --> 16:39.429
I have one
made out of a potato.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.565
Regular or alkaline?

16:41.566 --> 16:42.566
Idaho.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.502
I need some aas,
four of 'em.

16:45.503 --> 16:48.205
Tim, I'm so sorry.
I'm all out of those.

16:48.206 --> 16:51.976
Oh, great!
Perfect day.

16:51.977 --> 16:54.912
All I wanted to do today
was do what every other guy's
doing on this Sunday -

16:54.913 --> 16:56.013
Watch the super bowl.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.015
Oh, is that today?

17:00.585 --> 17:04.121
Yeah, it's today.
Jill's all bent out of shape.
Kicked my friends out.

17:04.122 --> 17:07.124
I had some guys over,
she didn't like it
'cause she got flu.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.526
Mm. I've got a touch
of that myself, tim.

17:09.527 --> 17:11.929
That's why
I'm boiling up
some bees.

17:11.930 --> 17:16.299
Yeah. Boy, I'd swear
I just heard you say
"boiling up some bees."

17:16.300 --> 17:18.201
<i>(chuckles)</i>

17:18.202 --> 17:21.105
Well, you know, I did.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.906
See, you steep the bees
for 45 minutes
in boiling water,

17:23.907 --> 17:25.909
Then you drink the liquid.

17:25.910 --> 17:27.978
It's an ancient
chinese remedy
for nausea.

17:27.979 --> 17:31.682
Sounds like an ancient chinese
cause of nausea.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.051
No, no, no, no, no, tim.

17:34.052 --> 17:37.254
It makes
a very delightful
bee tea.

17:37.255 --> 17:39.589
The best part is,
you don't have to add honey.

17:39.590 --> 17:42.492
<i>(chuckles)</i>

17:42.493 --> 17:46.130
Maybe I should whip some up
for jill.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.766
She doesn't think
I take care of her very well.

17:48.767 --> 17:52.736
Well, tim, it's not uncommon
for men to have difficulty
being nurturers.

17:52.737 --> 17:54.972
Yeah, tell me about it.

17:54.973 --> 17:58.876
When I was seven years old,
a little sparrow fell out
of a tree in our backyard.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.878
I tried to make it feel better.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.413
I stroked its little head
for four hours, you know.

18:03.414 --> 18:04.882
Oh. What happened?

18:04.883 --> 18:07.885
I think I pet it too hard.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.322
One of the eyes
popped right out.

18:13.758 --> 18:16.259
But I buried it
in a nice shoebox.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.128
At least you made
the effort, tim.

18:18.129 --> 18:20.630
Do you have any extra bees?

18:20.631 --> 18:24.134
I surely do. See,
I always buy them in bulk.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.038
I'll pay you for any I use.

18:28.039 --> 18:31.909
Don't worry about that, tim.
Just consider these
"free bees."

18:33.578 --> 18:36.580
<i>(buzzing)</i>

18:41.586 --> 18:43.653
Feeling better?

18:43.654 --> 18:45.355
No.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.524
You're gonna feel better
when you see what I got you.

18:47.525 --> 18:50.027
What did you get me?

18:50.028 --> 18:52.295
Going along with
your doctor theme,
I got...

18:52.296 --> 18:53.897
<i>Dr. No.</i>

18:56.034 --> 18:59.203
Let's see,
uh, <i>doctor dolittle.</i>

18:59.204 --> 19:01.939
<i>Dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde.</i>

19:01.940 --> 19:05.575
<i>Doctor naughty</i>
<i>and the night nurses.</i>
Oops!

19:08.613 --> 19:12.750
But I also spent an hour
making this special tea.
It's supposed to cure nausea.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.318
I think you'll love it.
It's real hot. Be careful.

19:15.319 --> 19:17.654
Does it have caffeine in it?
No.

19:17.655 --> 19:20.257
Good, 'cause I don't want
to get a buzz.

19:25.764 --> 19:29.332
You might get a buzz.
You might even get hives.

19:31.669 --> 19:35.505
That tea's
made out of boiled bees.

19:35.506 --> 19:38.909
Oh, come on. It's
an ancient chinese
remedy for nausea.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.911
Wilson gave it to me.

19:40.912 --> 19:44.148
It's
not easy working with bees,
let me tell you. Look at that.

19:44.149 --> 19:46.016
Some of those bees
were still alive.

19:46.017 --> 19:49.853
Oh, tim.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.922
Is this your idea
of taking care of me?

19:51.923 --> 19:54.624
It's better than
rubbing your head
for four hours

19:54.625 --> 19:56.660
And ending up dead
in a shoebox.

20:02.767 --> 20:03.901
Tim...

20:08.072 --> 20:13.010
All I want is for you to be
attentive and comfort me.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.378
Why is that so hard for you?

20:15.379 --> 20:18.415
I don't know.
I feel so useless
when you're sick.

20:18.416 --> 20:20.818
When something's broken,
I like to take it apart
and fix it.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.886
But I can't do that
with you.

20:22.887 --> 20:26.423
Probably put me
back together wrong.

20:26.424 --> 20:31.361
Maybe. Probably end up
with an eye down there
by your knee.

20:31.362 --> 20:34.298
A nose in your eye.
Then you could smell
what you're looking at.

20:37.302 --> 20:40.838
I can work on
being more attentive.

20:40.839 --> 20:44.041
How's that back?

20:44.042 --> 20:46.476
It's aching.

20:46.477 --> 20:50.580
You got a lot of knots
back there.
Yeah. That feels good.

20:50.581 --> 20:52.282
<i>(phone rings)</i>

20:52.283 --> 20:53.317
Oh, boy.

20:56.087 --> 20:58.421
Hello?

20:58.422 --> 21:01.424
I can barely hear you.
Hi, benny.

21:01.425 --> 21:03.894
They won? I didn't even
see it. That's great.

21:03.895 --> 21:05.262
Yeah?

21:05.263 --> 21:09.166
Big mike's
super bowl party, huh?

21:09.167 --> 21:12.269
Best one you ever
been to, huh?

21:12.270 --> 21:15.505
No, I'm staying here.
I'm nurturing my wife.

21:16.674 --> 21:18.575
I'm real happy.

21:20.178 --> 21:21.945
Thanks. Bye.

21:21.946 --> 21:25.182
Thank you, honey.
Yeah.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.985
Best party ever.

21:27.986 --> 21:32.422
I'm real happy.

21:32.423 --> 21:34.624
Honey, that's too hard.

21:41.199 --> 21:43.733
Hey, mom.
Hi.

21:43.734 --> 21:46.937
Uh-oh.

21:46.938 --> 21:50.974
Food, a pot and mom.

21:50.975 --> 21:53.476
No good can come
from this.

21:53.477 --> 21:56.479
In that case, you can
get your own breakfast.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.349
All right.
Cookies and ice cream.

21:59.350 --> 22:01.151
In your dreams.

22:01.152 --> 22:02.953
Mom, mom!

22:02.954 --> 22:05.889
Better come see dad.
He doesn't look so good.

22:05.890 --> 22:07.958
Then why would I
want to see him?

22:12.997 --> 22:15.065
<i>(muffled)</i> jill,
I think I'm dying.

22:15.066 --> 22:17.267

tim, I can't understand
a word you said.

We're gonna have to
ice you down!

22:28.379 --> 22:30.814
I like fixing things,
taking things apart.

22:30.815 --> 22:33.016
I can't do that with you
and fix you and...

22:36.687 --> 22:38.855
All I want is for you
to be attentive...

22:38.856 --> 22:39.957
<i>(audience giggling)</i>

22:39.958 --> 22:44.694

Tim, all I want is for you
to be attentive and comfort me.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.203
Why is that so...?
