WEBVTT

00:00.973 --> 00:02.939
So in honor of Earth Day,
we'll be helping

00:02.940 --> 00:05.034
save the environment by switching

00:05.058 --> 00:07.873
to recycled toilet paper and selling

00:07.873 --> 00:10.015
"The Day After Tomorrow"
on Blu-Ray for half off.

00:10.017 --> 00:10.970
That should do it.

00:10.971 --> 00:12.851
Uh, corporate is also asking us

00:12.853 --> 00:15.878
to discuss ways we can
all live more sustainably.

00:16.423 --> 00:17.456
Anybody?

00:18.358 --> 00:21.092
I turn the faucet off
while I'm brushing my teeth.

00:21.094 --> 00:22.928
Oh, I do that. I brush in the bathtub.

00:22.930 --> 00:25.355
Actually, baths are really
bad for the environment.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.365
Yeah, but they're really
great for my skin so,

00:27.367 --> 00:29.334
give and take.
Jerusha and I have started

00:29.336 --> 00:31.693
unplugging the refrigerator
whenever we're not home.

00:31.854 --> 00:34.531
- Doesn't your food go bad?
- Actually, yeah, it's awful.

00:34.573 --> 00:36.506
We've been throwing away tons of stuff.

00:36.508 --> 00:39.176
I'm a vegan so it's basically
like driving four Priuses.

00:39.178 --> 00:41.044
I play a game at home
where I try to use

00:41.046 --> 00:42.179
less water each week.

00:42.181 --> 00:43.513
Now I only flush my toilet

00:43.515 --> 00:44.482
when it's full.

00:45.684 --> 00:48.518
Okay, uh... that was a good discussion.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.054
Last but not least, each branch is now

00:51.056 --> 00:54.725
going to have an employee
"green ambassador" to promote

00:54.727 --> 00:56.860
sustainability efforts
within the store.

00:56.862 --> 00:59.921
Ours is going to be Jonah, obviously.

00:59.922 --> 01:02.866
- A-doy.
- What up, dork?

01:02.868 --> 01:04.468
Thank you, everyone.

01:04.470 --> 01:05.869
Oh, you don't have to speak.

01:05.871 --> 01:07.771
Well, I figured as green ambassador,

01:07.773 --> 01:10.356
I should serve the badge.

01:10.357 --> 01:11.807
It's a button. Calm down.

01:11.808 --> 01:14.444
"Now is the time to act
on climate change!"

01:14.446 --> 01:18.715
"If global temperatures rise
by just half a degree more,

01:18.717 --> 01:20.450
we will be at the point of no return

01:20.452 --> 01:25.255
towards a worldwide apocalypse
in less than ten years.

01:25.257 --> 01:28.725
The Obama administration
is working t"...

01:28.727 --> 01:31.395
oh, this was printed in 2009.

01:31.397 --> 01:33.463
- Well, did we make it?
- Just looked it up.

01:33.465 --> 01:35.061
No. Not even close.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.624
Oh, no.

01:37.315 --> 01:39.073
Somebody should really be
paying attention to this.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.281 --> 01:51.581
Hey, guys, I'm supposed
to sign people up

01:51.583 --> 01:52.950
for some green initiatives.

01:52.952 --> 01:54.751
Anybody feel like helping
start a compost?

01:54.753 --> 01:56.586
Isn't that where you put old
food in a barrel

01:56.588 --> 01:57.806
and then stir in poop?

01:57.807 --> 01:59.589
Well, that's an over simplification.

01:59.591 --> 02:01.024
Pass! My doctor says

02:01.026 --> 02:03.160
if I get meningitis
one more time, I'll die.

02:03.162 --> 02:06.029
Okay, well, uh, there's other stuff.

02:06.031 --> 02:08.664
Uh, this Sunday I'm putting
a team together

02:08.666 --> 02:09.798
to plant some trees out back.

02:09.799 --> 02:11.368
- I'll do that.
- Me too.

02:11.370 --> 02:13.103
I could really use
the overtime right now.

02:13.105 --> 02:16.139
Oh, yeah, so they're not
paying anybody for this.

02:16.141 --> 02:17.841
- So you'd be paying us?
- Me?

02:17.843 --> 02:19.276
- No, I'm...
- Or who's paying us?

02:19.278 --> 02:21.278
Uh, okay. Nobody is paying anybody.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.348
So you're just asking us
as like, a favor?

02:24.350 --> 02:27.784
I don't want to waste
a Sunday doing you a favor.

02:27.785 --> 02:29.593
I mean, no offense.
We're just not that close.

02:29.594 --> 02:33.657
It's not a favor for me.
It's a favor for the Earth.

02:33.659 --> 02:35.826
For your children.
For your grandchildren.

02:35.828 --> 02:37.294
- Mm, no thanks.
- I don't know.

02:37.296 --> 02:38.546
I can't even have kids.

02:38.547 --> 02:40.506
I fell of a four-wheeler
when I was nine.

02:40.507 --> 02:42.666
Burst my ball sack clean open.

02:43.802 --> 02:45.469
Okay, well, I'll just leave
the sign-up sheet

02:45.471 --> 02:47.623
at customer service
in case you change your mind.

02:48.307 --> 02:50.374
I can still have orgasms though!

02:51.810 --> 02:53.180
They just hurt really bad.

02:53.664 --> 02:55.384
If you need to use the bathroom,

02:55.385 --> 02:57.653
here's a key to
the employees' bathroom.

02:57.816 --> 02:59.316
- Thank you.
- The customer bathrooms

02:59.318 --> 03:00.917
hit sort of a tipping point,

03:00.919 --> 03:02.652
so we stopped cleaning them.

03:02.653 --> 03:05.688
Oh, hey, guys!
You remember Pastor Craig.

03:05.691 --> 03:06.498
Oh, yes. Hi.

03:06.499 --> 03:07.673
He's my pastor and friend.

03:07.674 --> 03:09.359
Well, friend first, pastor second.

03:09.361 --> 03:10.994
Well, pastor first and foremost.

03:10.996 --> 03:12.386
- Yeah, 50/50.
- Mm.

03:12.387 --> 03:14.331
Anyway, this is Amy and Mateo.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.638
- Hi.
- Amy's divorced

03:15.639 --> 03:17.868
and recently had a child
out of wedlock.

03:17.870 --> 03:19.569
- Yep.
- And Mateo's gay,

03:19.571 --> 03:21.104
but not in a way that defines him.

03:21.106 --> 03:22.448
- Oh, hallelujah.
- Don't worry.

03:22.449 --> 03:24.674
Pastor Craig is one of
those cool pastors

03:24.676 --> 03:26.443
who's down with all the gay stuff.

03:26.445 --> 03:29.179
That's probably not how
I would have phrased that,

03:29.181 --> 03:31.081
but hey, I did enjoy "The Birdcage."

03:32.264 --> 03:34.164
It was an important film.

03:34.292 --> 03:36.058
Pastor Craig's handing out
these little plants

03:36.186 --> 03:37.563
to all the customers for Earth Day.

03:37.565 --> 03:38.689
Yup. I like to say

03:38.690 --> 03:40.600
that God has a "plant"
for every one of us.

03:40.602 --> 03:42.302
Plant.

03:42.304 --> 03:45.004
Um, are you setting up
a booth in the store?

03:45.006 --> 03:46.773
Is this something you ran by me?

03:46.775 --> 03:50.643
Oh... sorry, I've been manager
so long, I forgot to ask.

03:50.645 --> 03:52.412
I'm sorry. Is it gonna be a problem?

03:52.414 --> 03:56.182
No, it's not a problem.
Just, next time, run it by me.

03:56.184 --> 03:58.451
- Okay.
- Or else I could get mad.

03:59.821 --> 04:01.654
I'm just kidding. Not totally,

04:01.656 --> 04:03.089
because you should run
these things by me.

04:03.091 --> 04:05.491
Ab... absolutely.
And thank you for doing this.

04:05.493 --> 04:07.026
- Okay.
- All right.

04:07.028 --> 04:09.329
Oh, and I do enjoy
the occasional episode

04:09.331 --> 04:10.830
of "Will & Grace."

04:10.832 --> 04:12.848
- I will tell the rest of us.
- Yeah.

04:13.702 --> 04:15.335
Thank you, Pastor.

04:24.946 --> 04:26.379
Oh, getting a lot of people to sign up

04:26.381 --> 04:27.465
for your little green thing?

04:27.466 --> 04:29.924
Yeah, everybody's signing up
for recycling.

04:29.926 --> 04:33.394
I've got "S. SquarePants,"
"Hannity Rules,"

04:33.396 --> 04:35.898
"Suck It," and "Yo Skanky Grandma."

04:36.011 --> 04:37.065
That's a solid team.

04:37.067 --> 04:40.335
Only real employee to sign up is Joe...

04:40.337 --> 04:41.603
Nuzzadoosh?

04:41.605 --> 04:43.033
Say it a little faster.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.439
Joe Nuzzadoosh?

04:44.441 --> 04:45.840
"Jonah's a douche." Got it.

04:45.842 --> 04:47.408
- Well done.
- Thank you.

04:47.410 --> 04:49.077
Why am I the only person who cares

04:49.079 --> 04:51.039
that the entire planet
is falling apart?

04:51.100 --> 04:52.533
Oh, come on. You live for this stuff.

04:52.535 --> 04:54.602
- What stuff?
- You know, finding a cause,

04:54.604 --> 04:57.204
leading a movement, getting
to say "unacceptable" a lot.

04:57.206 --> 04:59.940
I'm sorry, I guess I didn't
realize that humanitarianism

04:59.942 --> 05:02.192
was such a buzz kill.
I guess that also means...

05:02.845 --> 05:04.095
Bono is not cool.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.896
Oh, okay, so now you're Bono?

05:05.898 --> 05:07.164
- No, that's not what I mean.
- I see.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.499
You're just the Bono of the store?

05:08.501 --> 05:10.000
I didn't say I was Bono.

05:10.002 --> 05:11.502
All right, look, I'm just
messing with you.

05:11.504 --> 05:12.669
But it is kind of true though.

05:12.671 --> 05:14.071
I mean, I guess if...

05:14.073 --> 05:16.477
anybody here was Bono, it would be you.

05:16.842 --> 05:18.609
I mean, I guess.

05:18.611 --> 05:21.412
Hey, Heather! Jonah thinks
he's the Bono of the store!

05:21.414 --> 05:24.681
No, no, no, that's
not... no, he made me...

05:24.683 --> 05:26.683
why do I even talk to you?

05:26.685 --> 05:28.388
Aw, good talking to U2!

05:28.754 --> 05:31.188
- Get it? Like the letter U...
- Yeah, I got it.

05:31.190 --> 05:32.082
All right.

05:32.858 --> 05:35.893
Well, it is shaping up in here.

05:35.895 --> 05:37.861
I see you opted against
the standing desk.

05:37.863 --> 05:39.196
You just gonna join a gym instead?

05:39.198 --> 05:41.231
- What?
- Did you say it was okay

05:41.233 --> 05:43.534
for Glenn's pastor to set up
a booth in the store?

05:43.536 --> 05:46.036
Yeah, he's just handing
out little plants.

05:46.038 --> 05:47.538
Well, that's how it starts.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.473
Then, next thing you know,
cult leaders are handing out

05:49.475 --> 05:50.974
little tiny cups of Kool-Aid.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.310
- Drink up, everybody!
- That's a big, dark leap.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.546
Look, it's fine.
It's just this one time.

05:55.548 --> 05:57.915
Plus, Glenn had already
told him he could do it, so...

05:57.917 --> 05:59.716
Yeah, but you're the manager.
You can't let Glenn

05:59.718 --> 06:00.884
start walking all over you.

06:00.886 --> 06:02.711
You need to come down on him hard.

06:02.778 --> 06:04.488
I think you just want
to watch me yell at Glenn.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.090
This has nothing to do
with my personal feelings.

06:06.092 --> 06:07.925
Would I enjoy watching
you yell at Glenn?

06:07.927 --> 06:09.059
Of course I would.

06:09.061 --> 06:10.727
Would I prefer to do the yelling?

06:10.729 --> 06:12.129
Great question. No.

06:12.131 --> 06:13.764
I think it would be more fun
to be a spectator.

06:13.766 --> 06:15.232
- Hmm.
- Would I judge you

06:15.234 --> 06:16.900
if you lost it all
and it became physical?

06:16.902 --> 06:19.736
Of course not.
Would it be our little secret?

06:19.738 --> 06:21.138
Absolutely.

06:30.282 --> 06:33.117
Who switched the white coffee filters

06:33.119 --> 06:34.952
with the brown ones
that taste like dirt?

06:34.954 --> 06:37.595
I did. The white filters
contain dioxins which...

06:37.596 --> 06:38.766
I like dioxins.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.191
And is one person using
white coffee filters

06:41.193 --> 06:42.444
really going to ruin the planet?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.094
No, but if everybody said that...

06:44.096 --> 06:45.762
I'm not talking about everybody.

06:45.764 --> 06:46.645
I'm talking about me.

06:46.646 --> 06:48.999
Were you also the one
who replaced the straws

06:49.001 --> 06:50.834
- with these paper things?
- Yes.

06:50.836 --> 06:53.036
These have no structural integrity.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.476
Why did I even leave Syria?

06:54.477 --> 06:55.379
Okay, you know what?

06:55.380 --> 06:56.612
Somebody had to be green ambassador,

06:56.614 --> 06:57.947
so I said sure, but I'm tired of being

06:57.949 --> 06:59.448
the only one who
volunteers around here,

06:59.450 --> 07:02.218
so if anybody else
wants to take over for me...

07:02.220 --> 07:04.453
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Huh?

07:04.884 --> 07:06.928
I'll be the green guy or whatever.

07:08.093 --> 07:10.761
O... okay, gr... great. There you go.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.162
Finally, somebody's stepping up.

07:12.164 --> 07:13.864
So let's hear it for Cheyenne.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.611
I'll clap when I get
some decent coffee.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.671
"And sometimes the hardest
thing to accept

07:20.673 --> 07:22.839
is that we are not in control."

07:22.841 --> 07:24.508
So true. So true.

07:24.510 --> 07:28.512
"For only by losing
ourselves completely to God

07:28.514 --> 07:29.846
can we find"...

07:29.848 --> 07:31.081
- Ourselves.
- "God's mercy."

07:31.083 --> 07:32.670
God's mercy. Amen.

07:32.671 --> 07:34.685
Amen. Glenn, again,
just feel free to listen.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.286
Don't try and guess
what I'm going to say.

07:36.288 --> 07:37.854
I'm about to say it.
You're going to hear it.

07:37.856 --> 07:39.423
Okay, no problem at all, my friend.

07:39.425 --> 07:40.157
- Pastor.
- Glenn.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.892
- Mm-hmm?
- Can I talk to you

07:41.894 --> 07:45.128
- for a minute?
- Uh, yeah, I gue...

07:45.130 --> 07:46.530
do you think you can press pause?

07:46.532 --> 07:48.799
- Maybe take a fiver?
- We'll keep going.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.367
Okay, I've got the book anyway.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.902
- It's great.
- All right.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.103
Glenn, you said that he was

07:53.105 --> 07:54.371
just going to be handing out plants.

07:54.373 --> 07:55.906
I know! Who knew we'd be getting

07:55.908 --> 07:57.808
a live reading of his book too?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.943
Uh-huh, yeah. It's just that this

07:59.945 --> 08:02.045
kind of goes beyond
what we had discussed...

08:02.047 --> 08:04.047
Yeah, way beyond, baby!

08:04.049 --> 08:06.049
Uh, I just don't think

08:06.051 --> 08:08.452
that corporate is going to be
too excited to hear that

08:08.454 --> 08:11.321
a Christian pastor was doing
a book reading in the store.

08:11.323 --> 08:12.956
Okay, but I'm not worried about that.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.558
Well, you might not
be worried about it but...

08:14.560 --> 08:16.326
Can we talk about this later?
It's just that,

08:16.328 --> 08:18.262
I do have the book,
but nothing beats live,

08:18.264 --> 08:19.663
- so I just...
- Glenn.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.199
"Let's praise him
in a way that pays him."

08:25.294 --> 08:26.727
Hey, dude. Did you drop these

08:26.729 --> 08:28.529
cool wraparound sunglasses?

08:28.531 --> 08:30.117
No, I don't think...

08:30.932 --> 08:32.299
ah, I get it.

08:32.350 --> 08:34.094
Because they look like Bono sunglasses?

08:34.095 --> 08:35.962
- Yeah.
- Do we even sell those here?

08:36.042 --> 08:38.842
No, I had to go to CVS to get
these, but it was worth it.

08:38.844 --> 08:41.412
Jonah, hey. I need to talk to you

08:41.414 --> 08:43.347
about the green ambassador thing.

08:43.349 --> 08:45.416
Oh, uh, sure. Happy to help.

08:45.418 --> 08:47.130
Oh, you forgot to give me the button.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.522
Right, the button.
Here is your one button.

08:51.524 --> 08:53.290
- Wear it with pride.
- Thanks.

08:53.292 --> 08:56.293
And again, if you need any
help with ideas, you know,

08:56.295 --> 08:57.890
or just like a... like a sounding board,

08:57.891 --> 08:59.597
you can always come to me.

08:59.599 --> 09:01.465
That's okay. I don't want to.

09:01.467 --> 09:02.967
Oh, shoot. I was going to return these,

09:02.969 --> 09:04.777
but I think there's a
scratch on the inside.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.372
- You see that?
- No.

09:06.472 --> 09:08.138
You have to, like, get them close.

09:09.407 --> 09:10.154
No, I don't...

09:10.974 --> 09:12.743
- okay...
- Ey, Bono!

09:12.745 --> 09:14.578
- It's Bono, everybody!
- You know what?

09:14.580 --> 09:16.614
- I understand that.
- Hey, Amy?

09:16.616 --> 09:18.449
- Yes?
- Pastor Craig told this lady

09:18.451 --> 09:20.250
that if she bought a signed
copy of his book,

09:20.252 --> 09:21.619
she would get a free watch.

09:21.621 --> 09:22.721
Should I give her a watch?

09:22.722 --> 09:25.289
Wait, now he's selling
his book in the store?

09:25.291 --> 09:26.624
I told you you should have screamed

09:26.626 --> 09:27.889
at Glenn from the start.

09:28.561 --> 09:30.114
It's okay. It's a learning curve.

09:30.542 --> 09:33.998
When we haven't accepted God
in our hearts, we feel empty!

09:34.000 --> 09:37.294
And then we try to fill that emptiness

09:37.295 --> 09:39.503
by buying things.

09:39.505 --> 09:42.840
New phone, jewelry, that fancy blender.

09:42.842 --> 09:45.309
- This is just for nut butters.
- Okay, that's all right.

09:45.311 --> 09:46.472
Hey, what are you doing?

09:46.473 --> 09:48.257
You can't sell your book in the store.

09:48.258 --> 09:50.655
Oh, it's fine.
Glenn okayed it. Hallelujah.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.532
Well, it doesn't really
matter what Glenn okayed

09:52.533 --> 09:54.319
- because I'm the manager.
- Maybe I should go get Glenn.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.516
No, we don't need Glenn for this.

09:55.518 --> 09:57.171
Well, I know we don't need
him, but it would just be...

09:57.172 --> 09:58.849
- it'd be fun.
- Guys, I really think

09:58.850 --> 10:00.294
we should talk about this another time.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.728
I have customers,
and this is unprofessional.

10:01.729 --> 10:03.995
- Hallelujah.
- These are not your customers.

10:03.996 --> 10:05.817
She is. She bought two books.

10:05.818 --> 10:08.287
I'm gonna have to ask you
to please leave the store.

10:08.288 --> 10:09.618
Oh, so I guess you're kicking me out.

10:09.619 --> 10:11.606
You can take it that way, yes.

10:11.607 --> 10:13.396
All right, uh, as you guys heard,

10:13.397 --> 10:15.358
I've been asked to leave.

10:16.204 --> 10:17.680
That's okay. I implore you all

10:17.681 --> 10:21.028
to handle this like good Christians

10:21.029 --> 10:22.500
and not escalate it to violence.

10:22.501 --> 10:23.851
Nobody was talking about violence.

10:23.852 --> 10:26.050
Lord! Bow your heads.

10:26.052 --> 10:28.226
- No, please do not. Sir...
- Lord forgive her!

10:28.227 --> 10:30.632
- She knows not...
- Mm-hmm.

10:30.633 --> 10:31.799
- What she does.
- I know exactly

10:31.802 --> 10:33.202
what I'm doing.

10:33.204 --> 10:34.436
And if anyone wants
any more information

10:34.438 --> 10:35.771
about our church, you can reach us

10:35.773 --> 10:38.874
at lifesworkschurch.org/donate.

10:38.876 --> 10:40.088
- Okay, you're done.
- All right,

10:40.089 --> 10:42.277
just so you all know,
this was not a race thing.

10:42.279 --> 10:44.480
We're kicking him out
for practicing his religion.

10:44.482 --> 10:46.115
No, that is not true.

10:46.117 --> 10:47.416
All right, I stand corrected.

10:47.418 --> 10:49.918
Race may have had
a little to do with it.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.121
Okay.

11:01.732 --> 11:04.099
Okay, so welcome to the first meeting

11:04.101 --> 11:05.968
of the new and improved green team.

11:07.738 --> 11:10.716
Now let's all think of some
ways to help the environment.

11:10.823 --> 11:12.082
Yeah, and nothing super annoying

11:12.083 --> 11:14.065
that turns coffee into hot turd juice.

11:14.066 --> 11:15.793
Oh, sorry, Jonah.
I didn't see you there.

11:15.795 --> 11:17.328
I saw him.

11:17.329 --> 11:18.805
I didn't make the filters myself,

11:18.806 --> 11:20.250
so it's not a burn on me.

11:20.251 --> 11:22.026
We should post something
on social media.

11:22.027 --> 11:25.603
Okay, what about something
like #oceans?

11:25.605 --> 11:27.874
Yes, I love that. That's so good.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.453
Um, I'm sorry.

11:29.454 --> 11:32.450
What exactly
would a hashtag accomplish?

11:32.451 --> 11:34.916
Well, it's about
starting a conversation.

11:35.548 --> 11:37.018
What conversation?

11:37.019 --> 11:39.040
- This conversation.
- Yeah.

11:39.041 --> 11:41.384
- Yup.
- Oh, what if we took turns

11:41.385 --> 11:43.448
- teaching dumb kids to read?
- Mm.

11:43.449 --> 11:46.451
Ooh, that's good. Or prison reform.

11:46.452 --> 11:48.959
Okay, again, um, sorry...
none of my business,

11:48.961 --> 11:51.478
but, uh, wondering if maybe your scope

11:51.479 --> 11:52.680
is getting a little wide.

11:52.681 --> 11:54.290
Look who hates prison reform.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.026
I'm actually with Jonah on this one.

11:56.027 --> 11:58.089
I've been to prison, and honestly,

11:58.090 --> 11:59.180
it's perfect as is.

12:02.075 --> 12:04.035
Wait... wha... where's Pastor Craig?

12:04.036 --> 12:06.280
Oh, didn't you hear?
Amy kicked him out.

12:06.753 --> 12:08.679
- What?
- Yeah, he was really upset

12:08.680 --> 12:11.015
about it too. Like, devastated.

12:11.017 --> 12:12.383
I think he may
have said something about

12:12.385 --> 12:13.898
being disappointed in you personally.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.395
I don't remember exactly.

12:15.396 --> 12:17.663
Anyway, I hate to be the one
to break it to you.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.151
What... what are you...

12:21.152 --> 12:22.911
It's really important

12:22.912 --> 12:24.116
to break down cardboard waste.

12:24.931 --> 12:27.378
You know, Earth Day and all.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.502
Oh!

12:28.835 --> 12:30.486
You kicked Pastor Craig
out of the store?

12:30.487 --> 12:31.853
- I want the truth.
- Yes.

12:31.854 --> 12:34.038
Don't... don't lie to me, Amy.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.219
- You kicked him out!
- I said yes!

12:36.220 --> 12:38.275
He was selling his book
in the store, Glenn.

12:38.277 --> 12:39.744
I didn't agree to that.

12:39.746 --> 12:42.238
You... you are out of control, missy!

12:42.239 --> 12:43.748
And... and you are going
to pick up the phone

12:43.749 --> 12:45.539
and you are gonna call Pastor Craig

12:45.540 --> 12:47.356
and apologize to him right now!

12:47.357 --> 12:48.312
No.

12:49.548 --> 12:51.481
Then you can't be manager anymore.

12:51.624 --> 12:52.923
- What?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:52.925 --> 12:54.738
I thought...
I thought you could handle it,

12:54.739 --> 12:57.306
but you immediately came in and started

12:57.307 --> 12:59.785
whizzing all over the place
and changing up

12:59.786 --> 13:02.744
a perfectly good office and, "Oh, look."

13:02.745 --> 13:04.040
"Look at our window.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.137
Now we can all stare at Manager Amy."

13:06.139 --> 13:08.078
Glenn, you can't just
take the job back.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.774
Yes, I can. Get out of my office.

13:10.143 --> 13:11.642
That's not gonna happen.

13:11.644 --> 13:14.478
So... you're just keeping the job?

13:14.480 --> 13:17.539
- Yeah.
- Well then, what can I do?

13:18.522 --> 13:20.951
- Nothing.
- But then I can't do anything!

13:20.953 --> 13:22.925
- I know.
- So what? I mean,

13:22.926 --> 13:24.785
I've just gotta do whatever you say?

13:24.786 --> 13:26.829
- Yeah.
- But then I can't do what I want.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.240
And I want to do it.

13:29.589 --> 13:31.499
This is so unfair!

13:32.538 --> 13:34.404
Can I even slam the door?

13:34.667 --> 13:37.273
I'd rather that you didn't.

13:39.664 --> 13:43.033
And Jesus put forth his hand
and the leper was cured.

13:44.113 --> 13:47.136
So what miracles have you
experienced in your lives?

13:47.137 --> 13:49.304
And please, nobody say
their kids, okay?

13:49.306 --> 13:52.641
One time, I saw Lily
Tomlin in an airport.

13:52.643 --> 13:54.142
I mean, it looked like her.
I don't know.

13:54.144 --> 13:56.411
Hey, what's going on over here?

13:56.413 --> 13:59.748
Oh, nothing. Just having
a little employee Bible study.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.032
Would you care to join us?

14:01.033 --> 14:03.108
You could probably use some guidance.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.920
Ha-ha, well, can't we all?

14:04.922 --> 14:06.989
- Mm-hmm.
- But, uh, no.

14:06.991 --> 14:09.801
Unfortunately, there's no
religious gatherings allowed

14:09.802 --> 14:11.493
during company time,

14:11.495 --> 14:13.765
so everyone has to get back to work.

14:13.766 --> 14:14.792
Wow.

14:14.793 --> 14:17.966
So first Amy throws a man of
the cloth out of the store,

14:17.968 --> 14:20.068
and now we're not even allowed
to talk about the Bible.

14:20.070 --> 14:21.903
And we can't say
"Merry Christmas" anymore.

14:21.905 --> 14:23.705
Shut up, Earl. This isn't about that.

14:23.707 --> 14:26.232
Glenn, can we speak privately, please?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.743
I don't know. Can we?

14:27.745 --> 14:30.952
Okay. Glenn, I know
you're having some issues

14:30.953 --> 14:32.581
with not being in charge anymore,

14:32.583 --> 14:33.882
and so you're lashing out at me.

14:33.884 --> 14:35.817
And I'm trying to be
very cool about it,

14:35.819 --> 14:38.920
but I can't keep doing that
because it makes me look bad,

14:38.922 --> 14:42.691
so I am asking you politely.
Please knock it off.

14:42.693 --> 14:43.951
- Okay?
- Fine.

14:45.029 --> 14:47.095
But I have three minutes
left on my break.

14:47.097 --> 14:49.171
Am I allowed to talk about anything?

14:49.172 --> 14:51.099
Yes. Obviously you can talk.

14:51.101 --> 14:51.861
Fine.

14:52.436 --> 14:54.801
I'm gonna talk about, um...

14:55.606 --> 14:58.106
- John Cusack.
- Knock yourself out.

14:58.108 --> 15:00.909
Because John Cusack died for our sins,

15:00.911 --> 15:03.545
which is why we worship John Cusack,

15:03.547 --> 15:06.515
King of the Jews.
Okay, that is it, Glenn!

15:06.517 --> 15:09.618
You need to stop being a whiny,

15:09.620 --> 15:11.586
snotty little baby man

15:11.588 --> 15:14.289
and get back to work,
or I'm going to write you up!

15:14.291 --> 15:15.790
Do you understand me?

15:16.593 --> 15:18.460
I said, "Do you understand me?"

15:18.462 --> 15:19.795
- Yes...
- What?

15:19.797 --> 15:21.930
- Yes. I said yes.
- Good.

15:28.906 --> 15:31.573
I liked "High Fidelity,"
but I'm not sure

15:31.575 --> 15:33.942
how it holds up post MeToo.

15:36.113 --> 15:37.913
All right, everybody.
Let's show pollution

15:37.915 --> 15:39.714
what we think about it.

15:40.984 --> 15:43.718
Oh, yeah. Really good job, everybody.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.821
Can we take it again?
I forgot to cover my chin

15:45.823 --> 15:47.789
with my hand the way
Barbra Streisand always does.

15:47.791 --> 15:49.991
- Okay.
- How is this doing anything?

15:49.993 --> 15:51.827
They're just posing for selfies

15:51.829 --> 15:53.228
and then congratulating themselves.

15:53.230 --> 15:55.297
Yeah, dude. That's what Instagram is.

15:55.299 --> 15:56.832
- It's just dumb.
- Hmm.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.301
It almost seems like
you want to be in charge.

15:59.303 --> 16:00.769
That's not what I meant.

16:00.771 --> 16:02.838
Look, man, I get it. It's hard.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.407
One day you're on top of the
world, winning Grammys,

16:05.409 --> 16:06.842
performing Live Aid,

16:06.844 --> 16:08.977
forcing your music
onto people's iPhones...

16:08.979 --> 16:10.245
I'm not Bono!

16:10.247 --> 16:11.780
Okay, okay. What if we did, like,

16:11.782 --> 16:13.181
a Jimmy Kimmel kind of thing

16:13.183 --> 16:15.083
where we call people and we tell them

16:15.085 --> 16:16.685
that their kids are dead?
But then we're like,

16:16.687 --> 16:19.020
"Just kidding.
But they will be in 50 years

16:19.022 --> 16:21.523
if we don't take action
against climate change."

16:21.525 --> 16:25.227
Yes, I love it. Such a good idea.

16:28.332 --> 16:29.303
Knock-knock.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.200
Heard that Amy came down
pretty hard on you.

16:32.202 --> 16:33.802
Yeah, I bet you loved that, huh?

16:33.804 --> 16:36.037
What? Oh, come on. Give me some credit.

16:36.039 --> 16:37.873
I know we've had
our issues over the years,

16:37.875 --> 16:40.542
but I hate to see you
brought down like that.

16:40.544 --> 16:42.036
You think that's fun for me?

16:42.212 --> 16:44.546
- You're smiling.
- I'm always smiling.

16:44.548 --> 16:46.148
I'm a happy person.

16:46.150 --> 16:48.378
And I know what you're going
through, okay?

16:48.544 --> 16:50.977
I can only imagine how
hard it is that someone

16:50.978 --> 16:53.688
that you took under your wing
like a father and daughter

16:54.305 --> 16:56.124
would just rip into you like that.

16:56.409 --> 16:58.340
I mean, that's got to be a gut punch.

16:59.066 --> 17:00.395
What does it feel like?

17:00.397 --> 17:02.397
What? What?

17:02.399 --> 17:03.153
Just that...

17:03.575 --> 17:06.401
total, complete,
all-encompassing impotence.

17:06.403 --> 17:08.403
- You think I'm impotent?
- I don't.

17:08.405 --> 17:09.905
Oh... oh, no. Hold up!

17:09.906 --> 17:12.240
I will show you exactly
how impotent I am.

17:12.242 --> 17:13.909
- I'm gonna do something.
- Go. You should do it.

17:13.911 --> 17:15.577
- I'm gonna do something!
- Yeah, do it, Glenn!

17:15.579 --> 17:16.744
- I'm doing it!
- Do it, Glenn!

17:16.747 --> 17:17.483
I'm doing it!

17:18.848 --> 17:20.226
This doesn't concern you.

17:20.983 --> 17:21.970
Gotcha.

17:23.854 --> 17:26.354
I get that there's value
to spreading awareness

17:26.356 --> 17:28.690
and getting the word out.
I'm not opposed to that,

17:28.692 --> 17:30.091
but that can't just be all you do.

17:30.093 --> 17:31.993
That's just posturing.
You know, there's...

17:31.995 --> 17:33.228
there's the kind of people
who do things,

17:33.230 --> 17:34.896
and then there's the kind of people

17:34.898 --> 17:36.264
who talk about doing things.

17:36.266 --> 17:38.257
- And you're both of those?
- Exactly.

17:39.002 --> 17:40.902
- Well...
- Attention, shoppers.

17:40.904 --> 17:42.737
I would like to read to you from a book

17:42.739 --> 17:45.607
that was recently banned
from the store by management.

17:45.609 --> 17:47.776
What is this? What is happening?

17:47.778 --> 17:49.177
Proverbs 10:22 says,

17:49.179 --> 17:50.579
"The blessings of the Lord
make you rich."

17:50.581 --> 17:51.947
Glenn, stop it! Open the door!

17:51.949 --> 17:54.282
Wanna know the best-kept
secret of the Bible?

17:54.284 --> 17:57.018
"All the riches of the Lord
make you blessed,

17:57.020 --> 17:58.887
- but I never feel"...
- Wow.

17:58.889 --> 18:01.056
He is having an epic meltdown.

18:01.058 --> 18:02.791
"Through the window of my jet,

18:02.793 --> 18:05.894
a Cessna Citation CJ4."

18:05.896 --> 18:07.796
I'm not kidding. You need to stop this

18:07.798 --> 18:09.197
or I'm going to have to write you up.

18:09.199 --> 18:10.382
"So let us praise him
in a way that pays him."

18:10.383 --> 18:11.058
Glenn!

18:14.705 --> 18:17.939
This little light of mine,
I'm gonna let it shine

18:17.941 --> 18:19.608
What am I supposed to do about this?

18:19.610 --> 18:22.077
- I'll get the battering ram.
- We have a battering ram?

18:22.079 --> 18:23.144
Better to have it and not need it

18:23.146 --> 18:24.613
than need it and not have it.

18:24.615 --> 18:26.815
This little light of mine

18:26.817 --> 18:28.650
I'm gonna let it shine

18:28.652 --> 18:31.920
Let it shine, let it shine,
let it sh...

18:32.995 --> 18:36.131
Name: Glenn Sturgis.

18:36.133 --> 18:40.602
Violations: Disruption
within the store.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.346
Outward display of religion.

18:44.986 --> 18:46.753
Insubordination.

18:46.755 --> 18:48.580
"Insubordination."

18:48.581 --> 18:49.385
That's you.

18:49.386 --> 18:51.372
I don't like having to write you up.

18:51.793 --> 18:54.507
- You're forcing me to do this.
- I don't care!

18:54.508 --> 18:56.140
'Cause I'm writing you up too,

18:56.141 --> 18:59.263
and my boss doesn't send you
to the unemployment line.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.521
He sends you to hell.

19:01.568 --> 19:02.893
That was too far. I'm sorry.

19:02.894 --> 19:06.037
Come on, Glenn.
Don't make me send this in.

19:06.038 --> 19:08.758
Just... it's not too late. Please?

19:08.759 --> 19:12.078
Look, just tell me that this
is never gonna happen again

19:12.080 --> 19:14.147
and we can forget the whole thing.

19:17.859 --> 19:18.577
Okay.

19:19.507 --> 19:20.748
"Submit."

19:23.338 --> 19:24.832
Ugh. It's not going through.

19:26.061 --> 19:27.733
Stinks for you up the wazoo.

19:28.803 --> 19:30.371
What is wrong with this thing?

19:31.766 --> 19:34.976
- Are you logged in as Admin?
- Yes, obviously.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.772
Well, sometimes it helps
to uncheck all the boxes

19:39.774 --> 19:41.674
and then check them again.
I don't know why it does that.

19:41.676 --> 19:45.679
You mean, like, clear all
or manually uncheck each box?

19:45.680 --> 19:46.876
No, I mean like...

19:47.715 --> 19:49.816
Okay, well, first of all,
you got the wrong violation

19:49.818 --> 19:50.969
from the pull down menu.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.821
What? I thought
I selected the right one.

19:52.822 --> 19:54.089
Yeah, but sometimes if you hit a key

19:54.090 --> 19:56.789
it accidentally resets.
Just start over.

19:56.791 --> 19:59.358
- Okay.
- "Glenn Sturgis."

19:59.360 --> 20:02.328
So we will start with just
this store but eventually

20:02.330 --> 20:04.697
we'll recruit employees
from other stores,

20:04.699 --> 20:06.199
and it just builds from there.

20:06.201 --> 20:08.954
So it could go national
or even international.

20:09.537 --> 20:12.471
- Or past that.
- Um, yeah.

20:12.473 --> 20:13.942
So whatcha guys doing over here?

20:13.943 --> 20:15.708
We're starting an environmental group.

20:15.710 --> 20:18.612
- The Green Posse.
- We haven't settled on that.

20:18.613 --> 20:19.761
So kind of like Cheyenne's group?

20:19.762 --> 20:22.648
Well, yes, but there is room

20:22.650 --> 20:24.281
for more than one group, you know?

20:24.282 --> 20:26.943
There's plenty of work to be
done, and we are a little more

20:26.944 --> 20:28.574
about taking direct action, you know?

20:28.575 --> 20:29.615
Getting our hands dirty.

20:29.616 --> 20:30.934
Let me guess. Jonah's in charge?

20:30.935 --> 20:32.776
No, no, no, no. I mean...

20:32.970 --> 20:36.195
We're... it's more of,
like, a collective action

20:36.197 --> 20:38.462
- kind of a thing.
- You said you were in charge.

20:38.463 --> 20:40.273
Yeah... yeah, I did.

20:40.274 --> 20:42.871
But I... but I... but that's...
I said that because

20:42.872 --> 20:44.904
somebody, you know,
has to be in charge,

20:44.906 --> 20:47.340
and I'm kind of like the...
I'm the reluctant leader.

20:47.342 --> 20:48.808
- You know, it could be anybody.
- I'll do it.

20:48.809 --> 20:49.720
Absolutely not.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.205
What do you do when
an employee wants to change

20:52.206 --> 20:54.213
- their emergency contact info?
- Don't tell me.

20:54.215 --> 20:55.848
Justine's fighting with her mom again?

20:55.850 --> 20:58.023
Yes. They have a really
complicated relationship.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.720
They are the strangest pair.
Have you met her sisters?

21:00.722 --> 21:02.188
- No.
- They are...

21:02.190 --> 21:03.194
Don't tell me Justine's the normal one.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.600
No, Justine's the normal one.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.688
Aww, that's nice.

21:06.689 --> 21:07.896
Looks like they patched things up.

21:07.897 --> 21:08.822
It's not nice.

21:08.823 --> 21:10.672
You have no idea what nice is, idiot!

21:11.699 --> 21:13.299
What the...
