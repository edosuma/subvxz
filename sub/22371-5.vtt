WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.168
Gabriel: I might die.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.873
I very likely will die.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.092
I'm not asking to live.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.096
You've given me redemption,

00:16.183 --> 00:19.426
and it's that which makes me
no longer fear death.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.391
What I fear...

00:24.858 --> 00:26.940
is a fruitless death.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.188
(sniffles)

00:29.279 --> 00:31.941
What I ask for...

00:32.031 --> 00:34.899
after you have given me so much...

00:38.539 --> 00:40.906
is purpose.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.497
(fan whirring)

00:52.177 --> 00:54.043
(clatters)

01:31.049 --> 01:33.040
(knock on door)

01:34.386 --> 01:35.547
(door opens)

01:35.637 --> 01:40.131
Wakey, wakey, eggs pancakey, Gregory.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.471
No "thank you"?

01:43.562 --> 01:46.224
No "Yay!"?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.940
These cakes are made
from scratch by yours truly.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.109
I used genuine Hilltop sorghum.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.936
Milled it myself.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.363
You-- You-- You did?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.986
Uh-huh.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.818
There is a lot of love
on this tray, Gregory,

02:00.912 --> 02:03.825
because I wanted
to express love to you.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.997
'Cause you did the right thing.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.542
I told you if things started
to feel hinky at the Hilltop

02:08.628 --> 02:09.835
to come see me.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.252
A-And I did.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.751
With zero hesitation.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.878
Yes.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.834
You went to the satellite outpost

02:16.928 --> 02:18.009
as I instructed.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.963
Which was incredibly impressive.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.049
You told me that already.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.601
- I did?
- Three times.

02:25.687 --> 02:29.976
Listen, you came to see me.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.104
And though I was already away,

02:32.194 --> 02:36.153
dealing with that... rank betrayal,

02:36.239 --> 02:38.822
which was unknown to you...

02:40.535 --> 02:43.072
Oh, indeed, it was unknown.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.614
It was, indeed, unknown.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.699
And you waited for me.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.286
'Cause I wanted to tell you about...

02:51.380 --> 02:55.044
well, Hilltop and Alexandria, the Kingdom.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.874
But you were finding out at that point

02:56.968 --> 02:58.925
in Alexandria, right?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.094
Gregory, you don't need

03:01.181 --> 03:05.596
to explain yourself over and over again.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.470
H9)!-

03:09.564 --> 03:11.271
Hear me when I say,

03:11.358 --> 03:13.770
I'm telling you, you did the right thing.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.690
Every step of the way.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.823
Why did you bring me here?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.320
I brought you here

03:26.415 --> 03:29.999
because we now stand
on the precipice of greatness.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.541
You said you could solve the problem.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.086
Today's the day, Gregory.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.918
You fill your belly up with my love...

03:42.013 --> 03:43.754
and then you solve it.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.598
Aye! aye-

04:06.079 --> 04:08.992
(Negan chuckles)
Guys, get the doctor an omelet.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.244
He has gotten with the program.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.326
That is a nice kneel.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.547
Man: Negan's coming!

04:18.632 --> 04:20.624
(indistinct conversations)

04:36.276 --> 04:38.768
As you were.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.853
(indistinct conversations)

04:45.869 --> 04:47.951
Well, I, uh...

04:48.038 --> 04:51.827
I'd just like to start by saying
thank you for having me here today.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.543
This is something amazing.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.792
And that satellite outpost?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.173
Impressive.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.170
You already said that
about the satellite outpost,

05:03.261 --> 05:05.923
so why don't you go on, Gregory?

05:06.014 --> 05:07.504
(exhales sharply)

05:07.599 --> 05:10.261
Negan, let me lay this down
straight for you.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.559
I know how it is...

05:13.814 --> 05:16.522
negotiating the slippery,

05:16.608 --> 05:19.350
steep terrain of managing resources

05:19.444 --> 05:21.151
and the population

05:21.238 --> 05:23.730
and the big, scary you.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.982
But you might know...

05:28.119 --> 05:30.656
it's called the unknown.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.962
Listen, I mean it when I say it--

05:41.049 --> 05:44.713
Negan, I don't like killing people
any more than you do.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.760
I like killing people.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.212
Oh. Well, I--

05:48.306 --> 05:51.389
Negan: I say it's about
killing the right people.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.093
So, you kill the right people

05:54.187 --> 05:56.428
at the right time...

05:59.401 --> 06:03.190
everything falls into place.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.191
Everybody's hGPPY-

06:06.157 --> 06:09.695
Well, some people more than others.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.622
But you kill one,

06:14.708 --> 06:16.665
and you could be saving hundreds more.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.743
And that is what we are all about.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.963
We save people.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.756
That's...

06:24.843 --> 06:27.301
that's why you're called
the-- the Saviors. Oh.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.427
Gonna grab a smoke.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.632
NOW?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.723
You don't want to hear this?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.144
Don't need to.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.443
Tell me where to go and what to do,
I'll make it happen.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.486
(chuckles)

06:50.201 --> 06:52.033
(door opens, closes)

06:52.120 --> 06:55.454
Where were we, Gregory?
Oh, that's right.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.248
You were telling me
that you don't like to kill people,

06:58.335 --> 07:02.044
and I was saying that I do...

07:02.130 --> 07:04.713
under the right circumstances.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.585
Well, this-- this situation

07:06.676 --> 07:08.132
that we-- we find ourselves in,

07:08.219 --> 07:10.210
this-- this conflict...

07:11.431 --> 07:15.140
I can stop it
before it even gets started.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.184
- Given the right opportunity--
- You can't stop it before it starts,

07:18.271 --> 07:19.807
because it's already started.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.686
This isn't the kind of mess
you can just throw some sawdust on

07:22.776 --> 07:23.891
and shovel off the floor.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.692
We can.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.020
And I'm the shovel.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.491
I mean, here it is.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.490
I go to my people, and I-- I tell them

07:35.580 --> 07:39.744
if-- if you're joining with this--
this misled crusade,

07:39.834 --> 07:41.916
you're no longer citizens of the Hilltop.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.461
You're out on your asses.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.957
Negan:
You're still their guy?

07:51.596 --> 07:54.179
They still listen to you, Gregory?

07:55.058 --> 07:58.551
Can you exile people?

07:58.645 --> 08:01.137
The Hilltop is my house.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.646
I'm still the guy.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.519
I've always been the guy.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.443
Huh, if you're still the guy,

08:08.530 --> 08:11.363
if, indeed, you have always

08:11.449 --> 08:13.440
been the guy...

08:14.327 --> 08:16.785
then why the hell
didn't you know about the Widow

08:16.871 --> 08:19.033
leading an army of your people

08:19.124 --> 08:22.242
straight up my ass in Alexandria?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.886
You know what I think, Gregory?

08:37.058 --> 08:39.549
I think you're playing both sides.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.767
I think you are a thin-dicked politician

08:43.857 --> 08:48.101
threading the needle
with your thin, thin dick.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.151
Now, is listening to you
the right way to go,

08:53.241 --> 08:58.111
or is it the right place
and time for something else?

08:59.914 --> 09:02.872
No, no. Not trying to do that.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.324
No, not..

09:04.419 --> 09:07.127
I was-- wasn't aware of things

09:07.213 --> 09:09.250
until they were already in-- in motion.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.581
N-No hesitation.

09:11.676 --> 09:15.169
Allegiance, right there, the whole thing.

09:15.263 --> 09:19.257
I just-- I-l didn't know until
I-l knew, you know?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.966
Gregory-

09:22.604 --> 09:24.265
I believe you.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.895
Now make Negan believe you, huh?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.065
Hmm?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.485
(clears throat)

09:39.162 --> 09:41.153
The Hilltop is mine.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.499
I let a fox into my hen house.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.826
She and her people

09:47.921 --> 09:52.040
took advantage of my generous nature.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.546
I see that now, and I will fix it.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.683
If we go in with the right stage picture,

10:03.770 --> 10:05.807
a thick and veiny show of force

10:05.897 --> 10:09.481
surrounding Gregory
when he lays down the law,

10:09.567 --> 10:11.979
I think things go back to copacetic.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.484
If they don't,
we take a flyer on the place

10:16.574 --> 10:19.942
- and kill everyone there.
- (chokes)

10:20.036 --> 10:22.118
Unfortunate play,

10:22.205 --> 10:23.912
but the other communities
will get the message,

10:23.998 --> 10:26.239
and we achieve equilibrium.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.451
Plan A.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.537
Plan B..

10:32.882 --> 10:36.125
People are a resource.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.677
(bat slams)

10:39.764 --> 10:42.301
Money on the table.

10:43.685 --> 10:47.644
- (bat slamming)
- People are the foundation

10:47.730 --> 10:51.223
of what we are building here!

11:02.871 --> 11:05.784
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

11:07.083 --> 11:10.326
Are you confused about who we are?

11:11.296 --> 11:14.755
Are you confused about who is in charge?

11:17.594 --> 11:20.336
Are we backsliding, Simon?

11:24.434 --> 11:29.144
Please, tell me we're not backsliding.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.972
We're not backsliding.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.061
This is a pronounced event

11:37.155 --> 11:40.147
and a fragile moment.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.528
Hell, yes, it is.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.704
We need to win it all.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.466
Plan A

12:00.553 --> 12:04.171
is taking the Rick, the Widow,
and King Assface alive

12:04.265 --> 12:06.723
and making them dead

12:06.809 --> 12:10.347
in a very, very public
and instructive way.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.271
We kill the right people

12:13.358 --> 12:15.440
in the wrongest way possible,

12:15.526 --> 12:17.312
and we make them all watch!

12:17.403 --> 12:20.987
(four rhythmic gunshots)

12:27.121 --> 12:29.954
(walkers growling in distance)

12:30.041 --> 12:31.623
Simon:
Should we get our people out there?

12:31.709 --> 12:33.791
Line 'em up, light 'em up?

12:35.713 --> 12:37.249
No.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.456
They got some sort of hillbilly armor.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.417
We'd just be wasting metal on metal.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.721
And the RPG
is stashed at the cache, so...

12:47.642 --> 12:49.804
let's have ourselves a little chat.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.010
Simon, bring your new little friend.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.597
We may need him to say some words.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.183
Simon: Gregory, you're on deck.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.235
Gary, put three and three
in the windows.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.734
Tell them to stay the hell down
till we need them.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.948
Negan: Well, shit.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.454
I'm sorry.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.456
Jesus Christ.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.709
Negan: I was in a meeting.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.464
(walkers growling, pounding on walls)

13:41.988 --> 13:43.695
Well, that's handy.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.195
(knife clatters)

13:53.207 --> 13:55.619
This one still has a full clip.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.953
There wasn't any point in firing it.
I didn't have enough.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.459
Yeah, but you could've gone down
fighting, you big baby.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.415
(chuckles)

14:04.510 --> 14:08.048
I'm just pulling your dick,
breakin' your balls a little bit.

14:08.139 --> 14:11.723
You done good. Smart play.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.846
(growling, pounding continues)

14:17.065 --> 14:19.727
Let's get you properly on your ass.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.573
(groans)

15:00.316 --> 15:03.058
Your friend Rick is an asshole.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.778
You're an asshole.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.026
(chuckles)

15:09.117 --> 15:10.482
Yeah.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.158
I am.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.163
But he's gonna get people killed.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.663
BY You.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.496
See, I killed the widow's husband
and the ginger.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.295
But I didn't get them killed.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.048
That was your boy Rick.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.096
Big difference.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.438
You know, I saw you stop
for that Gregory idiot.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.817
You were there.
You saw the whole thing.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.769
You heard his little speech.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.065
Why would you stop
for that bearded prick?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.197
(growling continues)

15:57.290 --> 15:59.497
What I fear is a fruitless death.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.825
(chuckles)

16:01.919 --> 16:04.581
Jesus Christ.
You got to be kiddin' me.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.757
He split on your creepy little ass.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.340
The point of your life would
be saving that dickhead?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.681
That wouldn't be it.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.058
There had to be some reason
I did what I did.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.902
Maybe this is the reason.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.903
What?

16:40.374 --> 16:42.160
I think...

16:43.586 --> 16:46.248
I'm here to take your confession.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.290
(theme music playing)

17:29.507 --> 17:31.293
(man grunting)

17:36.013 --> 17:39.597
Rick: Your people
back in the chemical plant...

17:43.020 --> 17:44.977
did you win?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.725
(insects chirping)

17:46.816 --> 17:48.807
(groans, shuddered breathing)

17:52.446 --> 17:54.483
No one did.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.939
The hell's that supposed to mean?

17:57.285 --> 17:59.117
(coughing)

18:00.830 --> 18:03.037
The hell's that supposed to mean?

18:03.124 --> 18:05.115
(coughs weakly)

18:07.962 --> 18:09.919
Everyone's dead.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.964
Bullshit.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.793
There's no one else?
You're the only one?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.798
Me.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.755
The King.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.389
The Axe Man.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.720
And a short-haired psycho lady.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.026
You did this.
(ragged breathing)

18:34.113 --> 18:36.070
MY People...

18:38.451 --> 18:40.533
VOW People...

18:42.830 --> 18:44.320
they're all gone.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.406
(ragged breathing continues)

18:54.675 --> 18:56.837
Damn.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.010
And now...

19:03.100 --> 19:05.011
me, too.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.619
Negan: <i>We can wait it out</i> a <i>little bit,</i>

19:25.706 --> 19:28.619
see if my people
can figure something out.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.710
One thing that is sure as ass...

19:34.090 --> 19:36.331
if my people think I'm dead...

19:38.219 --> 19:40.586
a lot of folks are gonna die in there.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.212
Why?

19:43.307 --> 19:45.344
(walkers growling, walls thudding)

19:45.434 --> 19:46.799
Listen to me.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.306
I don't have shit to confess.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.647
Except maybe the fact
that I rubbed one out

19:52.733 --> 19:55.600
right where you're sitting
just to calm down a bit.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.815
(chuckles)

20:03.411 --> 20:05.527
Let me ask you something.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.747
Why'd you become a priest?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.831
I love God,

20:14.922 --> 20:17.289
and I love people.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.216
I wanted to bring them together.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.465
To help people through
their difficult times.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.467
To help them through their weaknesses.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.265
Well, look at that.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.217
That's my thing.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.019
I like to help people
through their weaknesses, too.

20:32.106 --> 20:35.690
Been doing it one way or another
my whole life.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.692
How do you help people?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.862
You want to know why people
are gonna start dying in there?

20:41.949 --> 20:45.237
Because I'm not there to stop it.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.317
(loud thud)

20:46.412 --> 20:48.403
(growling intensifies)

20:52.084 --> 20:54.075
(whistling)

21:15.357 --> 21:18.440
We have to assume Negan's dead.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.071
I'm Negan.

21:24.158 --> 21:28.322
And as I understand it,
everyone in this room is.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.746
Now, I realize there's a lot
of stress in the air,

21:31.832 --> 21:33.197
but just to clarify,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.329
are you saying
you're someone else, Regina?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.295
- No.
- Good.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.009
We should send the fence crew out.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.836
Grab a few others,

21:46.931 --> 21:50.094
we get 40 workers,
standing back to back.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.175
- No.
- We get them out with pipes,

21:52.269 --> 21:54.306
they clear a path...

21:54.396 --> 21:56.262
- just enough for a small team--
- Inadequate.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.268
What?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.980
The numbers you suggest aren't adequate.

22:04.615 --> 22:07.482
Given the current SRO density
of the herd surrounding us,

22:07.576 --> 22:10.489
40 workers armed with melee weapons
in the formation you propose

22:10.579 --> 22:13.697
would be overcome, closed in on,
and macked upon within a few minutes.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.408
Yeah. That's right.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.459
We use the workers as a distraction

22:18.546 --> 22:20.583
to get a small team past the herd.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.290
They can warn the outposts

22:23.384 --> 22:25.091
and then come back with the Fat Lady.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.214
Add to the approach's
slim chances of success,

22:27.304 --> 22:29.636
it's likely the play would lead
to widespread unrest,

22:29.723 --> 22:32.465
pitting the workers against the soldiers
when we're running out of food and fuel,

22:32.560 --> 22:34.927
upsetting our already
precarious apple cart.

22:36.397 --> 22:41.642
Maybe all we need to do
is put you out there, Eugene.

22:42.903 --> 22:47.864
Maybe it would motivate
the answer man

22:47.950 --> 22:50.157
to come up with a solution.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.987
Regina, he's right.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.660
The workers have the numbers,

22:56.750 --> 22:58.741
and we need to keep them on our side.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.123
We need to keep them in line.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.420
Even if we get a few of ours out

23:03.507 --> 23:06.750
and somehow clear the crowd,

23:06.844 --> 23:09.256
they have snipers
all around the building.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.672
(sighs)

23:12.766 --> 23:15.599
So right now,
let's deal with the other part.

23:16.937 --> 23:20.805
Someone in here
made everything out there happen.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.146
We're having our little
crisis-management meeting

23:24.236 --> 23:26.773
about the rebellion in Alexandria,

23:26.864 --> 23:28.821
us three outpost heads,

23:28.908 --> 23:30.819
and that's when they pile
this crap on us?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.617
That's when they cut us off?

23:32.703 --> 23:34.569
Come on.

23:34.663 --> 23:38.156
They knows all and sees all.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.705
Sometimes it doesn't take a gun.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.083
The right kind of rat...

23:46.717 --> 23:48.879
can kill plenty of people

23:48.969 --> 23:51.210
with just some talk.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.674
But it's not gonna be us,

23:56.769 --> 23:58.385
and it doesn't have to be the workers.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.062
Dwight, you got to face reality here.

24:01.148 --> 24:05.312
No, Simon, we keep what's ours,
and we don't give up a damn thing.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.938
We get out.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.020
And I don't want to hear backbiting

24:09.114 --> 24:11.321
or pissing or moaning from you two.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.363
You got a problem with that,
come at me.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.039
Hmm?

24:20.125 --> 24:23.709
You can't lead the Saviors
out of here, I will.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.959
(sighs)

24:49.321 --> 24:51.107
<i>Yes. m'! “W-</i>

24:51.198 --> 24:52.233
Yes!

24:52.324 --> 24:54.907
And...

24:54.994 --> 24:58.282
we're gonna find that subhuman
coward that did this to us,

24:58.372 --> 24:59.828
and we're gonna kill him

24:59.915 --> 25:02.907
very slowly in front of everyone here

25:03.002 --> 25:06.415
over the course
of a few very long days.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.718
Good meeting, people.

25:21.812 --> 25:25.726
Now let's make today
the best today it can be.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.149
(door opens)

25:41.707 --> 25:43.698
(knock on door)

26:05.314 --> 26:07.146
I'd like to express my sincere thanks

26:07.232 --> 26:10.020
for your support at the recent confab.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.647
I was doing my level best
to stay fully on the DL,

26:12.738 --> 26:15.025
but sometimes the mouth-brain
neuronal connection experience

26:15.115 --> 26:18.608
is a misfire, and foot met mouth
at an unavoidable velocity.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.034
You were right in there.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.577
If you didn't say it, I would've.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.075
As a token of my appreciation,

26:24.166 --> 26:27.500
I brought you some primo cukes
from my private stash.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.497
I'd like you to accept these
as a sign of my faith

26:29.588 --> 26:32.455
that we will, in fact,
find a way out of this pickle.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.165
Pun intended.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.886
Thanks for stopping by.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.674
Hmm.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.555
Hold up. It's..

26:45.646 --> 26:46.886
It's still wet.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.642
My aPOIQgies.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.942
You DIY'd these?

26:58.033 --> 26:59.865
That's right.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.903
Mm.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.541
I myself have painted
many a fantasy miniature

27:09.628 --> 27:11.039
on both the 28-millimeter

27:11.130 --> 27:14.122
and the 32-millimeter heroic scales.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.923
I believe once our snafu is R.l.P.,

27:16.009 --> 27:18.250
you and I should pass an evening
comparing notes,

27:18.345 --> 27:20.006
one enthusiast to another.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.963
Mm.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.015
We aren't gonna do that, Eugene.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.013
Fair enough.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.948
I fully understand the reasoning

27:45.038 --> 27:47.120
behind yours truly being
prime suspect

27:47.207 --> 27:50.120
in pretty much any
Benedict Arnold type situation.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.665
And in light of that,

27:53.755 --> 27:56.713
I'm doubly grateful
to have you watching my six.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.007
You were right back there.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.007
I didn't say anything more than that.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.846
(walkers growling, walls thumping)

28:17.613 --> 28:19.729
You helped the weak before this?

28:22.743 --> 28:25.235
Kids.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.240
You don't show them the way,

28:27.331 --> 28:29.993
well, they turn out like garbage.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.623
Little assholes become great big ones,

28:34.713 --> 28:37.080
so you show them the way.

28:37.174 --> 28:40.337
Adults, they need it, too--

28:40.427 --> 28:44.045
the government, laws, religion, guilt.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.096
People are weak.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.719
Everyone?

28:47.809 --> 28:50.096
Everyone.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.928
You're weak.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.305
Killing the innocent.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.436
Right and goddamn wrong.

28:57.194 --> 29:00.277
I'm weak, but me "killing the innocent"?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.485
That ain't why, Gabey.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.737
(growling, thumping continues)

29:05.827 --> 29:07.659
(board creaking)

29:12.209 --> 29:14.917
(growling intensifies)

29:15.003 --> 29:17.586
We'll wait a little bit longer,

29:17.673 --> 29:20.665
see if my people can pull it together.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.126
We still got choices.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.087
There are always choices.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.975
Why are you weak?

29:32.062 --> 29:33.973
It's not why I'm weak.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.431
That's the wrong question.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.768
It is how I am weak.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.273
You see, the thing is,
lam also strong.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.947
Everyone is a mix.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.947
You can use your weaknesses
to drive your strength,

29:49.037 --> 29:52.155
and obviously, I am strong as shit.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.240
I took this place,

29:54.334 --> 29:56.792
and it was a damn free-for-all--

29:56.878 --> 29:58.789
a loose confederation of assholes,

29:58.880 --> 30:01.963
an army made up of gangs of animals,

30:02.050 --> 30:04.508
and I brought it all together.

30:04.594 --> 30:07.552
The last guy that was in charge,

30:07.639 --> 30:09.926
he wasn't in charge of shit.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.099
He allowed people to be weak.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.096
I don't. I make them strong,

30:14.187 --> 30:16.724
which makes this world strong.

30:18.442 --> 30:19.932
You're gonna see, Gabey.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.565
See, I'm gonna make you
my new special project.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.696
Gonna make you nice and strong, too.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.866
We're gonna find your special purpose.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.154
Hell yes, we are.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.579
I'm strong.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.955
I've killed.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.378
(growling continues)

30:41.465 --> 30:44.503
I was at the Satellite Station.
I was a part of that.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.129
Oh.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.337
Then you killed my people
while they were sleeping.

30:50.891 --> 30:55.476
Well, look at you,
swinging your dick.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.727
Sure, Gabe.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.275
That's strong.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.774
But that's not what I'm talking about.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.903
Tell me how you're weak.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.984
(growling continues)

31:14.331 --> 31:16.242
We might be dead soon.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.994
You may be dead.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.543
Wouldn't you want to confess
before all that happens?

31:20.629 --> 31:23.587
Wouldn't you want absolution before that?

31:23.673 --> 31:25.584
Forgiveness?

31:32.140 --> 31:35.258
Costs you nothing more
than saying the truth aloud.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.974
You don't think
you have anything to confess?

31:41.024 --> 31:42.890
People you've killed?

31:44.361 --> 31:47.399
I haven't killed anyone
that didn't need it.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.065
The workers you treat like slaves.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.615
It's an economy.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.568
Some people win, some people lose,

31:54.663 --> 31:56.950
but no one's a slave,
no one's going hungry,

31:57.040 --> 31:59.156
and you couldn't say that
before all this.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.367
Carl told us about your wives.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.372
The women you pressure
into marrying you?

32:13.098 --> 32:16.136
Every one of those ladies made a choice.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.803
Was there a first?

32:22.190 --> 32:24.306
One before all of this?

32:26.111 --> 32:28.318
A wife you promised
to have and to hold,

32:28.405 --> 32:29.736
forsaking all others?

32:29.823 --> 32:32.531
One you told that lie to?

32:32.617 --> 32:34.528
Lucille, give me strength.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.537
(walkers growling)

32:53.263 --> 32:55.550
All right, Gabe!

32:55.640 --> 32:57.927
No one's coming for us.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.726
You took your shot-- shots.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.393
It's time to go.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.981
(insects chirping)

33:37.015 --> 33:40.053
Hey. Give me a hand with this.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.053
Yep.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.889
- Got it?
- Yeah.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.407
We can use these now.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.037
What?

34:06.127 --> 34:08.243
Well, think about it.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.123
There ain't no Kingdom no more.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.873
Yeah.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.629
We know what we got to do.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.503
We blow open the Sanctuary,

34:17.597 --> 34:19.213
let the walkers flood in.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.547
They'll surrender.

34:20.641 --> 34:21.803
It'll be done.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.351
Hell, we could end this by sundown.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.806
They have workers in there, right?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.482
Families, too.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.318
Are there?

34:36.992 --> 34:39.154
We'll hit the south side
of the main building.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.869
The workers live in the north side.

34:41.955 --> 34:45.072
They'll be up the stairs
before the walkers even get in.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.032
What if they don't?

34:48.587 --> 34:50.793
There are people in there
who aren't fighters.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.996
Doing this could change that.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.958
Make them pick up guns
and stand by the Saviors.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.173
And if the Saviors don't surrender,

34:59.264 --> 35:01.175
maybe everyone fights us.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.550
And we don't have
the Kingdom anymore.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.179
We're not doing this.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.244
No. You ain't doing this.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.668
There's a plan,
and everyone's sticking to it.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.620
Not everyone.

35:32.714 --> 35:35.001
There's a lot of our people
that are dead, Rick.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.883
Things change, man.

35:40.180 --> 35:43.093
Negan and that other group,
this is on them.

35:44.768 --> 35:48.261
If people die,
it's their fault, not ours.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.392
Daryl, we can't do this.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.894
And we got our own people to look after.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.275
We're not doing this.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.649
Hey. I'm not letting you do this.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.282
This ain't your choice.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.584
(electricity crackles)

36:15.674 --> 36:18.541
(fan motor winding down)

36:26.142 --> 36:27.849
Hell.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.706
Daryl!

36:51.793 --> 36:53.659
Get up!

37:07.559 --> 37:10.051
(explosions)

37:12.897 --> 37:15.229
(metal clattering)

37:23.867 --> 37:26.484
(engine struggling)

37:26.578 --> 37:28.660
(sighs)

37:28.747 --> 37:31.079
(engine struggling)

37:31.166 --> 37:33.157
(motorcycle approaching)

37:46.890 --> 37:49.302
(sighs)

37:49.392 --> 37:51.178
There's a plan.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.727
We got to see it through.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.521
We gotta win.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.100
Yeah, we gotta.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.812
Choke hold's illegal, asshole.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.450
Mm-hmm. Yes, it is.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.493
Looks like I'm walking.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.075
Yep.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.706
I'll meet you when I'm done
with the last play.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.663
You sure about doing it?

38:21.925 --> 38:24.542
Yeah, I am.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.378
(engine starts)

38:34.687 --> 38:37.770
<i>Negan: Was all that confession crap
just a move?</i>

38:40.026 --> 38:41.687
Something to distract me,
so you could take

38:41.778 --> 38:45.521
your lame-ass-nowhere-near-
the-side-of-the barn shot at me?

38:45.615 --> 38:48.198
Gabriel:
I was doing what you said you do.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.696
I was gonna save people by killing you.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.198
Negan: Well, then, I'll tell you what.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.949
If you want
to take your next few shots

38:54.040 --> 38:55.781
right through this wall,
see how you do?

38:55.875 --> 38:57.957
Go ahead.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.661
I gotta tell you,
I don't like your odds,

39:00.755 --> 39:04.669
and I promise you I will not turn
the other ass cheek on that one.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.127
(walkers growling)

39:11.724 --> 39:14.716
We have Lucille
to help us get to the Sanctuary.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.848
We have that gun.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.687
We should use it.

39:19.774 --> 39:23.392
Most importantly, Gabriel,
we have each other.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.944
People are a resource.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.362
We make it inside,

39:28.449 --> 39:30.190
we live.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.276
(walkers growling)

39:41.880 --> 39:45.999
We can take a chance, we can "gut up,"

39:46.092 --> 39:48.709
play dead ones across the courtyard.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.930
Or...

39:57.020 --> 39:59.512
or I can just kill you,
but that is not what I want.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.268
What I want is for you to work with me.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.150
That is all I ever want.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.782
I've killed before,
but that's not my greatest sin.

40:13.703 --> 40:15.569
No.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.535
I locked my congregation
out of my church

40:19.626 --> 40:21.788
when this all just started.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.210
I listened to them die...

40:25.089 --> 40:27.171
as I cowered.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.920
I failed them.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.093
I failed God.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.297
And every day,

40:35.391 --> 40:39.601
I work to lessen that failure,

40:39.687 --> 40:42.930
to be of service and purpose.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.774
Now I offer you

40:49.864 --> 40:52.777
the assurance of a pardon,

40:52.867 --> 40:55.575
penance, and absolution.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.573
I will go with you.

40:57.664 --> 41:01.202
I will show you
that working together as equals

41:01.292 --> 41:03.704
is the only true way to grace...

41:05.380 --> 41:07.371
to a future.

41:08.091 --> 41:10.583
I will do this...

41:10.677 --> 41:12.588
if you confess.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.549
Jesus, Gabe.

41:16.849 --> 41:19.591
What you did,

41:19.686 --> 41:21.677
that is some horrible,

41:21.771 --> 41:24.308
cowardly, spineless shit.

41:25.942 --> 41:29.310
But I guess that's what a confession's
supposed to be, right?

41:36.035 --> 41:38.777
My first wife was a real wife.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.040
My only real wife.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.837
Till death did us part.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.339
It was before this.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.969
I lied to her,
I screwed around on her.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.854
And she was sick.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.391
And when she went...

42:10.820 --> 42:13.687
when she went, it was during this.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.118
I couldn't put her down.

42:26.419 --> 42:28.831
That is how I was weak.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.836
That is what I will confess.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.839
Because, yeah,

42:36.929 --> 42:39.296
maybe we do bite the big one here.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.351
(door opens)

42:45.438 --> 42:47.395
(growling continues)

42:48.524 --> 42:50.060
You're forgiven.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.818
Thanks.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.272
You can keep your gun.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.356
(growling continues)

43:05.166 --> 43:09.376
Sucks, Gabe, but it looks like
we got to risk eating it...

43:09.462 --> 43:11.624
- (corpse crunches)
- ...by eating it.

43:11.714 --> 43:13.296
I don't understand.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.999
You ever done this trick
with the guts before?

43:16.094 --> 43:18.051
- Mm-hmm.
- (bones crack)

43:18.137 --> 43:20.128
(grunts)

43:20.223 --> 43:23.636
These are putrid, decaying organs,

43:23.726 --> 43:25.433
dead blood, piss, and shit

43:25.520 --> 43:28.512
that have been cooking all day
in the Virginian sun.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.185
(sighs)

43:31.275 --> 43:33.141
None of your people
ever gotten sick from this?

43:33.236 --> 43:35.443
We're from Georgia.

43:35.530 --> 43:38.488
(chuckles)
Look at you lucky shits.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.900
(sighs)

43:55.424 --> 43:57.415
(walkers growling)

44:02.014 --> 44:03.755
Let's make some noise.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.716
Hey!

44:05.810 --> 44:07.642
- Hey!
- (shouting)

44:07.728 --> 44:09.344
Hey!

44:10.523 --> 44:12.514
(walkers growling)

45:07.246 --> 45:09.157
(gunshots)

45:19.425 --> 45:20.915
Oh, damn.

45:24.430 --> 45:27.172
Now, we were due for a delivery
today from my place.

45:28.643 --> 45:30.759
Spotters haven't seen anything.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.053
Yeah, the transport truck
would've turned around,

45:33.147 --> 45:34.387
seeing the state of things,

45:34.482 --> 45:37.224
but nothing's come up any of the roads.

45:39.028 --> 45:42.111
Chem outpost doesn't miss deliveries.

45:43.282 --> 45:45.114
Something happened.

45:45.201 --> 45:47.192
That Rick guy happened.

45:47.286 --> 45:48.947
Our outposts are getting hit while--

45:49.038 --> 45:51.279
(breathing heavily)

45:51.374 --> 45:53.206
What is it?

45:53.292 --> 45:54.498
They're coming up the stairs.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.576
Eugene: Walkers?

45:56.671 --> 45:58.582
The workers.

45:59.882 --> 46:02.294
They said we'd have to shoot them.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.001
(muffled conversations)

46:08.891 --> 46:10.973
(door opens)

46:12.561 --> 46:14.518
(conversations stop)

46:18.192 --> 46:22.527
Simon: Workers are designated
to stay on the ground level.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.650
Jesus Christ.

46:24.740 --> 46:28.654
Specifically,
their activity is constrained

46:28.744 --> 46:32.328
to the factory floor
and the outdoor gardens.

46:32.415 --> 46:34.827
Potter: It's too hot down there.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.874
And we sure as hell
ain't going outside.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.372
When you gonna fix the power?

46:38.462 --> 46:40.578
It doesn't need fixing.

46:40.673 --> 46:42.289
We're conserving fuel.

46:42.383 --> 46:44.715
Mm? It's a shared sacrifice.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.590
Oh. You're sharing now.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.921
Oh.

46:50.016 --> 46:52.257
That sort of tone
is not gonna work for me--

46:52.351 --> 46:54.809
Hey, everyone, everyone!

46:54.895 --> 46:57.683
Look, we're gonna get through this, okay?

46:57.773 --> 46:59.389
We just need some more time.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.099
Man:
We need some more water!

47:01.193 --> 47:03.355
There are young people, old people!

47:03.446 --> 47:05.187
We're rationing that out, too.

47:05.281 --> 47:07.818
We work, you protect us.
That was the deal.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.024
- That's how it was supposed to work.
- Woman #2: Yeah.

47:10.119 --> 47:11.609
Man: We need water!

47:11.704 --> 47:13.115
Man #2:
Do you have a plan for getting us out?!

47:13.205 --> 47:14.661
You heard the man!

47:14.749 --> 47:18.583
You all need to get back
to the factory floor.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.455
Man: Where's Negan?

47:21.297 --> 47:23.538
Man #2: Is he dead?

47:25.634 --> 47:28.126
Woman: Answer the question.

47:28.220 --> 47:33.010
Everyone has to return
to the factory floor now!

47:33.100 --> 47:35.762
I'm not going anywhere.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.186
I need to correct you on that point.

47:39.273 --> 47:41.059
- Woman #2: Where's Negan?!
- Gavin: Gun!

47:42.026 --> 47:43.642
(woman yells)

47:43.736 --> 47:46.398
lam Negan!

47:46.489 --> 47:48.821
Anyone else want a bullet?

47:48.908 --> 47:50.649
Anyone?

47:51.952 --> 47:53.943
(whistling in distance)

48:01.754 --> 48:03.711
(whistling continues)

48:07.426 --> 48:09.383
(chuckles)

48:12.223 --> 48:14.009
Ah, Regina.

48:14.100 --> 48:17.183
Now, why'd you have to go and do that?

48:18.938 --> 48:22.681
I am guessing that a lot of you
fine folks thought

48:22.775 --> 48:25.142
I was dead, chewed up,

48:25.236 --> 48:27.318
never to be crapped out again.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.985
Well, here's a little refresher

48:31.075 --> 48:32.736
on who the hell I am.

48:32.827 --> 48:35.489
I wear a leather jacket, I have Lucille,

48:35.579 --> 48:38.571
and my nutsack is made of steel.

48:38.666 --> 48:42.910
I am not dying
until I am damn good and ready.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.374
Now, if you'll all excuse me,

48:46.465 --> 48:49.878
I am in deep need of
a sandwich, a shower,

48:49.969 --> 48:53.837
and some of that, uh, wilting lion orchid

48:53.931 --> 48:57.925
deep-tissue shit that Frankie
learned in San Francisco.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.884
Hell, I might do it all at once.

49:01.355 --> 49:05.770
But after that, we have some
serious business to attend to.

49:09.697 --> 49:12.405
Like talking to my right-hand man.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.402
You see, we got to figure out

49:14.493 --> 49:18.657
how all this could've happened
like it happened.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.656
And then...

49:21.750 --> 49:23.536
well, and then we're gonna get back

49:23.627 --> 49:26.745
doing what we have always done.

49:29.091 --> 49:31.298
We will save people.

49:31.385 --> 49:35.049
Woman: Thank you, Negan.
Thank God for you.

49:40.436 --> 49:44.521
And that is why I am here.

49:44.607 --> 49:49.522
Gentlemen,
gently take him to number two.

49:49.612 --> 49:51.102
Gently.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.884
Arat: Good news is, I figured out
where that asshole's gun came from.

50:16.096 --> 50:17.837
And the bad news?

50:19.183 --> 50:21.049
Gary: They're ours.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.134
Stolen from the armory.

50:23.229 --> 50:25.140
A worker couldn't have gotten
this many guns

50:25.231 --> 50:26.437
without us knowing about it.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.435
Laura: They couldn't have got one.

50:28.526 --> 50:32.144
No, one of our own did this--
is doing this, right now.

50:32.238 --> 50:35.447
Negan:
Tell me how we find him, Simon.

50:36.659 --> 50:41.074
Simon: We... find when
the munitions went missing.

50:41.163 --> 50:43.154
Through that, we get an idea of the how,

50:43.249 --> 50:47.288
which hopefully leads us right to who.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.995
But we start with when.

51:02.101 --> 51:04.092
(insects chirping)

51:05.604 --> 51:07.595
(breathing heavily)

51:10.734 --> 51:12.725
(helicopter blades whirring)

51:47.021 --> 51:49.012
Yo.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.143
Dr. Smartypants.

51:59.658 --> 52:02.070
Big, big chance here.

52:02.161 --> 52:03.651
You solve this thing

52:03.746 --> 52:07.239
with the bad-smelling
convention outside,

52:07.333 --> 52:10.041
I will make you very, very happy-

52:10.961 --> 52:12.872
But even if you try your best

52:12.963 --> 52:14.749
and I know you try your best

52:14.840 --> 52:16.877
but you don't figure something out...

52:18.010 --> 52:20.843
I assure you, I will kill you quickly

52:20.929 --> 52:24.217
so you don't have to see
all the awful, horrific things

52:24.308 --> 52:27.721
that are gonna go down here
when we run out of food and water.

52:29.188 --> 52:31.680
What I'm saying...

52:31.774 --> 52:34.106
is that I got your back either way.

52:35.069 --> 52:36.901
You got mine?

52:41.200 --> 52:43.066
Yeah.

53:05.307 --> 53:07.173
(whistle blows)

53:12.898 --> 53:16.061
Gabriel, it's Eugene Porter.

53:17.486 --> 53:19.773
Dr. Eugene Porter here.

53:19.863 --> 53:24.073
We were, uh... neighbors,
traveling companions.

53:24.159 --> 53:26.617
We've eaten dog together, so...

53:27.746 --> 53:30.534
I imagine that joins us
in some manner for life.

53:33.919 --> 53:36.786
I'm here to formally welcome you
to the Sanctuary.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.996
In our current state of siege,
the prickly heat alone

53:39.091 --> 53:40.547
might be enough
to turn you off the place,

53:40.634 --> 53:42.716
so I took it upon myself

53:42.803 --> 53:45.261
to... bring you some welcome-wagon items

53:45.347 --> 53:48.430
in hopes of providing some relief.

53:55.190 --> 53:56.931
Gabriel?

54:03.615 --> 54:04.855
(keys rattle)

54:15.169 --> 54:18.662
You need to see
Dr. Carson 2.0 A.S.A.P.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.542
I d-- I do.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.250
That's why I'm here. That's why--

54:24.344 --> 54:26.676
It's the reason we're here, I think.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.471
I think it's...

54:28.557 --> 54:31.675
Carson... is Maggie's doctor.

54:33.687 --> 54:36.850
W-We have to get him out of here.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.602
We have to get him out of here.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.400
We have to get him out of...

54:44.448 --> 54:46.439
(theme music playing)
