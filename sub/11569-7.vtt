00:15.347 --> 00:17.884
Aha! A long-nippled fox!

00:17.917 --> 00:20.853
Look at the nipples on this rare beauty!

00:20.887 --> 00:23.390
You're gonna look great
mounted on my wall.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.527
Mr. Pickles!

00:26.559 --> 00:27.860
Okay.

00:27.893 --> 00:30.396
"You sure did a good job killing me."

00:30.429 --> 00:32.031
Thank you." You're welcome.

My Dear Boy

00:53.583 --> 00:54.921
Please...

00:54.954 --> 00:55.923
No.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.624
Please!

00:57.656 --> 00:58.858
- N-O.
- Please!

00:58.892 --> 01:01.060
Guess what I'm making
for dinner tonight.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.463
Meatloaf again!

01:02.496 --> 01:04.531
- Meatloaf? My favorite!
- Please!

01:04.563 --> 01:09.602
Ohh, Steve was throwing
rocks at my window all night.

01:09.635 --> 01:11.237
Who? Oh, down boy.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.239
- Mr. Pickles' man-pet?
- No, Mr. Pickles.

01:13.272 --> 01:14.607
Lives under the doghouse?

01:14.641 --> 01:16.109
You know, Steve...

01:16.143 --> 01:17.111
Please?!

01:17.144 --> 01:18.312
No!

01:18.344 --> 01:19.813
You can't have a BB gun.

01:19.846 --> 01:22.149
It's too much responsibility.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.484
Fine. Come on, Mr. Pickles.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.121
Oh...

01:27.153 --> 01:32.825
Aw, if I had a BB gun,
I could shoot all kinds of things.

01:32.858 --> 01:34.494
Ow! Huh?

01:34.528 --> 01:38.398
Hey, oh! Tommy and Mr. Pickles!

01:38.430 --> 01:40.334
Who are you?

01:40.367 --> 01:42.835
You don't remember me? Seriously?

01:42.868 --> 01:44.805
I used to be a Mafia hit man.

01:44.837 --> 01:47.774
The witness protection
turned me into a bigfoot.

01:47.807 --> 01:50.444
- You caught me having sex with a deer.
- Oh, yeah!

01:50.477 --> 01:52.478
I stole your mother's cherry pie.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.647
Oh, I remember now!

01:54.680 --> 01:55.615
Bye!

01:55.649 --> 01:56.983
- Tommy, hold on.
- Okay.

01:57.016 --> 02:00.353
I'd like to introduce
you to my deer-wife.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.022
And my deer-boy.

02:03.055 --> 02:04.658
Deerboy! That's me!

02:04.691 --> 02:06.927
Hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo,

02:06.959 --> 02:08.662
hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo...

02:08.693 --> 02:10.997
So, Tommy, would you mind
looking after him for a bit?

02:11.031 --> 02:13.500
The missus and I could
use some alone time.

02:13.532 --> 02:15.768
Maybe that could teach
me about responsiblit...

02:15.801 --> 02:17.670
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks, Tommy.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.338
So, what do you wanna do, Tommy?

02:19.372 --> 02:22.476
Hey, I know... Can you tell me
what my butthole looks like?

02:22.508 --> 02:24.677
I ain't never seen it.

02:24.711 --> 02:27.014
And there it was...

02:27.046 --> 02:29.216
the most beautiful creature I ever seen.

02:29.248 --> 02:30.950
Then I shot It in the face!

02:30.984 --> 02:33.787
Today I bagged
a long-nippled fox,

02:33.819 --> 02:38.394
an albino "trhino,"
and I ran over that buck on my way in.

02:38.473 --> 02:40.627
Let me know when you got
something worth bragging about.

02:40.659 --> 02:42.061
Good morning, fellas.

02:42.094 --> 02:43.396
Huh.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.533
Hello. I'd like to purchase this BB gun.
It's a surprise...

02:46.566 --> 02:49.203
Whoa. First you gonna has to fill out

02:49.235 --> 02:51.003
- some paperworks.
- Paperworks?

02:51.037 --> 02:54.193
You could be buying it
to shoot the president's eye out!

02:54.259 --> 02:54.483
What?

02:54.574 --> 02:57.711
So I'ms gonna need you to
take a lie detector test.

02:57.743 --> 02:59.479
Lie detector test?!

02:59.512 --> 03:01.048
That's right.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.216
Hey, yo, hey, yo, hey,
yo, hey, yo, hey, yo...

03:03.250 --> 03:05.485
Hey, yo,

- Hey, yo, look!

03:08.587 --> 03:10.022

03:10.056 --> 03:11.858
- No, Deerboy!
- La-la-la-la!

03:11.890 --> 03:13.192
Oh, no!

03:13.225 --> 03:15.395
Hey, yo,

03:15.427 --> 03:16.663
No, Deerboy!

03:16.695 --> 03:18.331
No, stop that right now!

03:18.365 --> 03:20.834
Hey, look at all these other animals!
How you doing?

03:20.866 --> 03:22.568
- No! No!
- Hey! Jacuzzi water!

03:22.602 --> 03:24.337
Num-num-num! Oh, this is good, Tommy!

03:24.371 --> 03:25.739
- No, Deerboy!
- Oh, hey!

03:25.771 --> 03:27.540
What's this do? Wow!

03:27.574 --> 03:29.743
How do I get him to do what I say?

03:32.878 --> 03:34.847
The hell are you barking about, d...

03:34.881 --> 03:36.449
Got to go. See ya. Hey, yo!

03:36.483 --> 03:37.718
Hey! Oh!

03:37.751 --> 03:39.218
Trespassers!

03:39.252 --> 03:41.688
Hey! Oh...

03:45.491 --> 03:47.593
Aah! Steve!

03:47.627 --> 03:48.695
Aah!

03:50.497 --> 03:54.201
Beverly, I-I trapped Steve!

03:54.234 --> 03:55.469
Oh, hey!

03:55.502 --> 03:58.070
Hello, Steve. It's nice to meet you.

03:58.104 --> 04:01.241
Stop that. Get back here, Steve!

04:02.675 --> 04:04.644
You're lucky you're the Goodman's kid,

04:04.677 --> 04:05.912
or we would've shot ya.

04:05.944 --> 04:07.647
Now, what you doin' in here, boy?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.582
You drink any of the Jacuzzi water?

04:09.616 --> 04:11.251
Shut up, stupid!

04:11.283 --> 04:14.954
It all started when my dad said
I couldn't have a BB gun, and...

04:14.987 --> 04:16.223
- He's right!
- He's right!

04:16.255 --> 04:18.291
You know what "BB" stands for,
don't you?

04:18.324 --> 04:19.625
- "Big..."
- "Babies."

04:19.658 --> 04:21.260
- Here.
- Have a man's...

04:21.293 --> 04:22.995
- gun.
- Cool!

04:23.028 --> 04:24.997
Now, let's shoot up some beer cans!

04:25.031 --> 04:26.300
Good idea!

04:27.666 --> 04:29.835
I meant shoot some empties outside!

04:29.869 --> 04:32.472
How stupid are you?

04:32.504 --> 04:34.440
Now, keep her steady!

04:34.473 --> 04:36.976
And... fire!

04:37.009 --> 04:38.010
Whoa!

04:38.043 --> 04:39.812
Whoo-hoo!

04:39.846 --> 04:43.449
Well, I got to go find
this talking deer, Deerb...

04:43.483 --> 04:44.483
Talkin' deer?!

04:44.516 --> 04:45.819
We got to kill it!

04:45.851 --> 04:47.353
You can't kill Deerboy!

04:47.387 --> 04:48.788
Why come?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.191
'Cause... a dead deer can't talk.

04:51.223 --> 04:52.425
He's right!

04:52.459 --> 04:55.495
Let's grab some traps,
and we'll catch it alive!

04:55.528 --> 04:57.497
Wow. We keep saying the sam...

04:57.529 --> 04:59.198
Shut up, you ding-dong-diddiot!

04:59.232 --> 05:02.436
Come on, boy.
We got to find Deerboy before they do!

05:03.870 --> 05:06.038
Ugh. Is this really necessary?

05:06.072 --> 05:09.608
Is you or is you not,
not, not a terrorists?

05:09.641 --> 05:10.810
Not?

05:10.843 --> 05:12.678
Is you an alien from the future

05:12.711 --> 05:15.214
sent to kill my unborn son's daughter?

05:15.247 --> 05:17.516
What? No. What do you want from me?

05:17.550 --> 05:18.819
I just want to know the truth!

05:18.851 --> 05:20.986
The truth is I'm just a normal guy

05:21.019 --> 05:23.522
who lives a very happy life!

05:24.557 --> 05:25.559
Unh-unh.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.159
I-I... I live a happy life.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.063
I live a... sad life?

05:30.896 --> 05:34.200
I live a very sad life.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.471
- That'll be $7.95.
- Ohh!

05:37.504 --> 05:39.639
Hello?

05:39.672 --> 05:41.575

05:41.608 --> 05:43.576

05:43.610 --> 05:45.312
In the woods by our cabin.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.648
And once we gets it,
we ain't never gonna let it talk to you.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.750
- Hey!
- Huh?

05:49.783 --> 05:50.751
I just saw Deerboy!

05:50.783 --> 05:51.985
- Oh! Whoo-whee!
- Come on!

05:52.017 --> 05:53.652
We gonna get ourselves a Deerboy!

05:53.685 --> 05:55.521
No, boy. He went this way.

05:55.555 --> 05:56.757
Come on!

05:58.524 --> 06:02.194
I know you're out here, Steve!

06:16.442 --> 06:18.611
Now, who are you?!

06:18.644 --> 06:21.847
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,

06:23.115 --> 06:24.250

06:24.283 --> 06:27.387
Wow, wow, wow! Wow, wow.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.923
Hey, baby!

06:29.956 --> 06:31.358
You want to fool around?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.926
You sound attractive.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.196
Oh, yeah! Unh!
I think I love y... Aaah!

06:38.064 --> 06:40.434
There you are!
We got to get out of here!

06:40.466 --> 06:41.734
Not now, Tommy!

06:41.767 --> 06:43.769
- Aaah!

06:43.802 --> 06:46.439

06:52.144 --> 06:53.779

06:53.812 --> 06:55.882
So that's what my butthole looks like.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.150
- Come on!
- Aah!

06:58.250 --> 07:00.085
So that's what my butthole looks like.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.655
Waaaah!

07:01.687 --> 07:03.622
Hey! Get back here, talking deer!

07:04.824 --> 07:06.793
Slow down! W-Wait for me, guys!

07:06.826 --> 07:08.595
Take my hand!

07:10.262 --> 07:11.597
Oh, dang it!

07:11.630 --> 07:12.598
Beer?

07:12.632 --> 07:14.968
Of course, stupid!

07:15.071 --> 07:17.637
Oh! That was close.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.139
Please, seÃ±or.

07:19.172 --> 07:23.576
Please no tell anybody
about me talking donkey.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.811
Bye, Donkeyboy!

07:24.843 --> 07:27.646
Adios, amigos!

07:29.182 --> 07:32.085
You sure are hard to take care of.

07:32.117 --> 07:35.322
Today was the greatest day of my li...

07:35.355 --> 07:36.956
Aaaaaaaah!

07:36.990 --> 07:38.290
Wha...? Oh, no!

07:38.324 --> 07:41.862
Mr. Pickles, go find Deerboy's parents!

07:51.538 --> 07:54.508
Uh... Steve?

07:54.540 --> 07:55.841
Hello?

07:55.875 --> 07:57.511
Huh?

07:57.543 --> 07:59.612
Beverly, we need to talk.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.949
I've been living a lie,
and I owe you the truth.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.786
Something's changed in our relationship.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.156
And that something is me... eatloaf.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.859
I can't stand it anymore!
I hate meatloaf!

08:12.891 --> 08:15.194
Please just make
something else for dinner.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.963
Don't say anything. I...
Just think about it.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.867
Tommy, I'm bleeding to death!

08:20.899 --> 08:23.870
You got to shoot me, Tommy!

08:23.903 --> 08:25.372
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

08:25.404 --> 08:27.373
You got to p-p-p-p-put
me out of my m-misery!

08:27.406 --> 08:28.407
No!

08:28.440 --> 08:31.076
Look, I-I've led a wonderful life.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.746
I got to see my butthole!

08:33.779 --> 08:36.381
But...
you still have your whole life ahead.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.385
Ah, the good days are all behind me.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.886
Few years from now,
I'm working at the mall

08:40.919 --> 08:43.389
selling cellphone covers
or meatballs or something.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.259
I'm depressed.
Start drinking, smacking my wife around.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.228
She don't respect me no more, Tommy!

08:48.260 --> 08:50.663
She takes the kids and
moves in with the beaver.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.332
The beaver's sucking her
nipples all the time, Tommy.

08:53.365 --> 08:58.004
One way or another,
I end up with a gun in my mouth!

08:58.037 --> 09:01.173
You got to shoot me, Tommy!

09:01.206 --> 09:02.075
N-O!

09:02.107 --> 09:04.343
Do it! Blow my brains out, Tommy!

09:04.376 --> 09:07.012
No! You're my responsibility!

09:07.046 --> 09:09.716
So take care of me! Shoot me, Tommy!

09:09.749 --> 09:11.117
- No!
- Please!

09:11.149 --> 09:12.885
- No...
- Please!

09:12.918 --> 09:15.087
- Uh...
- Pleeeeeeeease!

09:15.120 --> 09:17.890
Okay. I'll do it.

09:17.923 --> 09:19.725
Bye, Tommy.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.760
Bye, Deerboy.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.701
Huh?

09:30.102 --> 09:31.870
Oh! You shot it!

09:31.903 --> 09:34.441
Our talkin' deer!

09:34.474 --> 09:36.142
Oh, it talks, all right.

09:36.174 --> 09:38.745
Hah! Eat me, ya dumb drunks.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.113
It talks!

09:40.145 --> 09:44.250
We should ho...
honor its wishes.

09:46.451 --> 09:49.288
In the old days,
I would have sought revenge.

09:49.322 --> 09:53.259
But now I got my Deerboy to look after.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.595
Thanks, Papa!

09:55.628 --> 09:57.129
So long, Tommy.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.632
- Stay out of trouble, kiddo.
- Bye!

09:59.666 --> 10:01.301
Hey! Where's my ma deer?

10:01.333 --> 10:04.670
She... don't feel good. Ever again.

10:04.703 --> 10:06.072
Good boy!

10:06.105 --> 10:07.640
Surprise!

10:07.673 --> 10:08.975
- No thanks, Dad.
- Huh?

10:09.008 --> 10:11.811
You're right.
Guns are too much responsibility.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.648
- Ohhh...
- Aha! Where's Steve?

10:14.681 --> 10:16.115
Dad, enough

10:16.149 --> 10:19.586
- about your imaginary friend Steve!
- Ohh...

10:19.619 --> 10:22.154
Well, the deer hunters
dropped off some deer meat,

10:22.187 --> 10:24.957
- so I made deer-loaf.
- All right!

10:24.990 --> 10:27.159
- I-I'm glad we had that talk, dear.
- Huh?

10:27.192 --> 10:28.495
I've had enough deer.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.964
I'm gonna try and go
look at my butthole.

10:30.996 --> 10:32.498
- Huh?
- Oh?

10:32.532 --> 10:34.100
Good night, Papa.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.935
Good night, my Deerboy.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.370
And goodbye, my deer wife.

10:38.403 --> 10:41.841
- A talkin' deer and a bigfoot?
- Huh?

10:41.874 --> 10:43.375
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot!

10:43.408 --> 10:45.944
Your heads are gonna look
great mounted on my wall.

10:45.977 --> 10:48.313
Raaaa...

10:48.346 --> 10:50.316
Oh!

10:50.349 --> 10:51.718
Thanks, dog.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.353
Hey, you mind watching my
Deerboy for a bit?

10:54.386 --> 10:57.289
Me and my new broad could
use some alone time.
