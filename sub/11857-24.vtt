00:05.667 --> 00:07.041
Thing's gonna break my back.

00:07.125 --> 00:09.250
- Dad, it's slipping.
- Honey, let me help you.

00:09.333 --> 00:11.667
It's okay. Exercise.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.083
Good for me.

00:14.667 --> 00:17.083
King Warlord strikes again!

00:17.166 --> 00:18.667
Why is it guns all the time?

00:18.750 --> 00:20.208
I'm getting him karate lessons.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.458
Awesome! Whoosh!

00:22.542 --> 00:24.583
- How much are those?
- I don't know.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.417
- Not much.
- 'Probably not a lot.'

00:26.500 --> 00:28.291
I knew a lot of kids
who took 'em in Ohio.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.083
(female #1)
We can manage, Adam.
Your job starts tomorrow.

00:31.166 --> 00:34.458
- Don't need a pep talk,
Emily.
- 'Honey?'

00:34.542 --> 00:36.625
Are you gonna get the rest
of the boxes out of the
truck?

00:36.709 --> 00:38.083
Just give me a second, will ya?

00:38.166 --> 00:40.417
I need one second
for my stuff, okay?

00:50.125 --> 00:52.625
Remember the night
of the tornado in Cincinnati?

00:52.709 --> 00:54.667
When mom made us all
sleep in the basement.

00:54.750 --> 00:55.625
No.

00:55.709 --> 00:57.417
We stayed up all night.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.792
Made popcorn.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.834
It was fun.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.625
Remember, dad?

01:03.709 --> 01:06.166
Yeah.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.458
It's gonna be
a lot easier life here,
guys.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.625
'I promise.'

01:14.709 --> 01:17.667
[whispers]
Pop. Pop.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.208
Help me.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.500
(female #2)
'Family massacre.'

02:08.583 --> 02:11.000
Mom, dad and son
shot and killed.

02:11.083 --> 02:13.917
Dad's prints were
all over the gun.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.333
The Jacobi's.

02:15.417 --> 02:18.166
Uh, dad was an out-of-work
computer programmer.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.458
And looked like he was the doer.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.875
It was a...John List
kind of thing.

02:21.959 --> 02:25.583
The older kid, the
daughter,
survived a bullet to the
head.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.458
I can't decide
if that's lucky or not.

02:27.542 --> 02:29.291
You're alive,
but you got to face knowing

02:29.375 --> 02:30.875
your dad tried to off you.

02:30.959 --> 02:32.959
We could never confirm
the father was the
doer.

02:33.041 --> 02:35.208
But now that Kim's
awake and talking..

02:35.291 --> 02:37.667
Your boss wants a statement.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.083
Doctor says Kim's
memory is spotty.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.875
But we can try.

02:42.959 --> 02:44.750
Boss wants to close the case.

02:44.834 --> 02:46.875
Uh, meaning the DA
wants himself on the front
page

02:47.000 --> 02:48.917
with his arm around
little orphan Kim.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.583
And us doing the work for him.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.417
We can't all have
bosses like yours.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.250
Hey, I'm Ed.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.792
I've been working with Kim
for the last five months.

03:05.875 --> 03:09.041
Detective Rush and Valens.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.458
How's she doin'?

03:10.542 --> 03:12.667
Lot better since
she came to a few weeks ago.

03:12.750 --> 03:13.834
Real progress.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.417
Hi, Kim.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.667
(Rush)
'We need to talk to you
about'

03:20.750 --> 03:22.917
what happened the night
of the shooting.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.667
Kim..

03:29.750 --> 03:31.959
...was it your father
who did this to you?

03:35.208 --> 03:36.959
He loved you.

03:37.041 --> 03:37.959
Your mom too.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.250
How do you know that?

03:39.333 --> 03:42.333
Well, I can see it.
In these photos.

03:42.417 --> 03:45.000
I don't really remember
that night. I'm sorry.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.583
You were in the house
with your family.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.834
Do you remember
what you were doing?

03:56.250 --> 03:57.542
Is she okay?

03:57.625 --> 04:00.041
Kim, I'm right here.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.583
Was there a fight?

04:01.667 --> 04:02.875
Your father get upset
about something?

04:02.959 --> 04:04.333
I don't remember!

04:04.417 --> 04:06.625
- 'No! Don't! Don't!'
- 'Please!'

04:13.834 --> 04:16.000
(male #1)
Always. Romeo.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.125
Kim, look at me.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.166
You sure you saw
your father's body..

04:25.250 --> 04:27.291
...before you were shot?

04:28.750 --> 04:31.625
Means the dad
wasn't the shooter.

04:31.709 --> 04:33.792
(Ed)
'Maybe she should rest.'

04:33.875 --> 04:35.875
Okay.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.125
I'm sorry, Kim.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.291
For putting you through that.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.166
Someone else was in
that house that
night.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.500
Someone calling
themselves Romeo.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.208
Left a witness behind.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.417
Witness who's
startin'
to remember.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.250
'Gun was registered to Adam.'

05:44.333 --> 05:45.500
Prints on it were his.

05:45.583 --> 05:47.583
The Jacobis were on
the verge of bankruptcy.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.417
Adam had recently lost an..

05:49.500 --> 05:51.333
...IT job in Cincinnati.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.834
(Vera)
'Dad moved the family
to Philly for work.'

05:52.917 --> 05:54.500
Got fired a month later.

05:54.583 --> 05:56.709
Uh, neighbor said
Adam was depressed.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.083
Original investigation found
the family computers

05:59.166 --> 06:03.041
behind the house, all
smashed
up, hard drives erased.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.709
'And presumably by Adam?'

06:04.792 --> 06:07.417
- I can relate to that part.
- 'Let's get those
computers.'

06:07.500 --> 06:09.250
Maybe the tech unit
can find something

06:09.333 --> 06:11.417
pointing to our shooter.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.625
Lil do the interview with
you this morning, Scotty?

06:13.709 --> 06:17.667
Uh, said she was stopping
at home, on her way back.

06:25.709 --> 06:28.834
Had a dream you
were reading to
me.

06:28.917 --> 06:32.083
Your favorite book
when you were a
kid.

06:32.166 --> 06:35.291
I can't remember the name.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.959
Brought you some lunch.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.709
Came back from work for that?

06:39.792 --> 06:41.542
Didn't want you going hungry

06:41.625 --> 06:43.709
complaining nonstop.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.291
Mom, you okay?

06:48.375 --> 06:51.041
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.750
Go on now before they
wise up and fire you.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.333
'But you call me..'

06:59.417 --> 07:01.917
...if you need anything.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.041
You got my cell, right?

07:03.125 --> 07:05.667
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. So go.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.375
Go.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.542
Go get 'em, Lilly.

07:17.083 --> 07:20.041
"The Velveteen Rabbit."

07:20.125 --> 07:21.542
That was the book.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.959
Made me read it a million times.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.667
The stuffed rabbit
who wanted to be real.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.583
And the boy he belonged to.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.250
He became real, remember?

07:36.458 --> 07:37.917
When the boy let him go.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.583
I bet he missed him
for the rest of his life.
Huh?

07:44.667 --> 07:47.041
That stubborn
old thing came
back.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.542
Make sure the boy was okay.

07:52.709 --> 07:53.792
He did?

07:53.875 --> 07:55.959
Couldn't keep him away.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.709
Go on now, Lil.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.542
Bye, mom.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.542
Bye, baby.

08:27.834 --> 08:31.208
So, you're the one who found
the bodies, Mr. Reed?

08:31.291 --> 08:34.709
Our kids were pals.
We shared a carpool.

08:34.792 --> 08:39.583
Waited...in the
driveway
20 minutes then I went
in.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.875
(Miller)
'Is it true that the wife'

08:40.959 --> 08:42.542
'was the family's
main breadwinner?'

08:42.625 --> 08:46.125
Dental hygienist,
plus parent in
charge.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.750
Kids didn't listen to Adam?

08:47.834 --> 08:49.083
The daughter didn't listen.

08:49.166 --> 08:52.208
Not when it came
to that boyfriend of
hers.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.917
Uh, boyfriend?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.125
That wasn't in the report.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.041
- You ever meet this guy?
- 'No.'

08:57.125 --> 09:00.500
But one morning, it was my
turn
to drive the kids to school

09:00.583 --> 09:03.834
and...as usual,
the Jacobis were
late.

09:03.917 --> 09:05.458
(Emily)
'Adam, my hands are full.'

09:05.542 --> 09:07.875
'Please, just get
his lunch ready.'

09:07.959 --> 09:09.667
Hey.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.166
I just found something
on this computer.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.667
We need to have a family
discussion, young lady.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.208
'I found your online chats.'

09:16.291 --> 09:18.125
What online chats?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.709
That's none of your
business.
Don't read her e-mail.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.750
You are too young
to write those..

09:22.834 --> 09:24.166
...things to that boyfriend.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.125
Me and Rick don't
talk online, dad.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.583
(Emily)
'We need to meet this Rick.'

09:27.667 --> 09:30.250
And have you guys fight
in front of him? No way.

09:31.375 --> 09:32.750
Martin and Jeff are here!

09:32.834 --> 09:34.667
What's takin' you guys so long?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.458
I was just, uh..

09:37.542 --> 09:40.125
So, ready?

09:40.208 --> 09:42.000
No more computer for you, Kim.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.792
- 'And no more cell phone.'
- Adam, come on.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.333
Emily, if you'd read them,
you wouldn't trust her
either.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.333
You know, just because you're
miserable, dad, doesn't mean

09:49.417 --> 09:50.375
the rest of us have to be.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.667
Teenagers.

10:04.750 --> 10:07.166
Glad I've got that
to look forward to.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.875
Where'd Kim meet this boyfriend?

10:08.959 --> 10:10.417
School, I guess.

10:10.500 --> 10:14.458
Adam said the kid called at all
hours, wouldn't leave his name.

10:14.542 --> 10:17.917
You ever hear Kim
refer to him as "Romeo"?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.834
No. I did see him once, though.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.375
From my living room, at night.

10:21.458 --> 10:25.417
He was skulking
around
the Jacobis' house.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.250
Getting ready for
a balcony scene?

10:34.709 --> 10:36.917
Rick Lambert?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.500
Detectives Jeffries.
Rush.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.041
I didn't do it.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.500
Want to talk to you
about
your girlfriend, Kim
Jacobi.

10:43.583 --> 10:46.125
Oh! The, uh, new girl
that got shot?

10:46.208 --> 10:49.166
She was, uh, not my girlfriend.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.500
Her family thought different.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.041
Oh, man.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.250
Kim had the wrong idea about us.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.417
How so?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.041
I was breaking in the new girl.

11:00.125 --> 11:03.208
"Friends with benefits"
is what it's called.

11:03.291 --> 11:06.291
Oh, youth of
today.
Real inspiration.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.917
We know about
the online messages

11:08.041 --> 11:09.542
you two were exchanging.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.208
Nah, not me.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.417
Me and my mom
don't have a computer.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.875
You think Kim could've been..

11:14.959 --> 11:16.625
...chatting with some other guy?

11:16.709 --> 11:19.583
Mm, yeah.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.250
Name "Romeo"
mean anything to you?

11:21.333 --> 11:24.417
Oh. That's the dude
finally spoke her language.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.208
And what language is that, Rick?

11:26.291 --> 11:27.917
You know, feelings.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.875
- What the hell is this?
- It's not from you?

11:54.959 --> 11:59.125
Uh, no. And you better not
be telling people it is.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.458
Well..

12:00.542 --> 12:02.458
...You're the only
person
I know at this school.

12:02.542 --> 12:05.125
Read the frickin' card, yo.
It's got hearts on it.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.792
"I'm the only one
who knows the real
you

12:09.875 --> 12:13.000
"how unhappy you've been,
Kim, for a long time now.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.250
"I've watched--"
Give it back,
Rick!

12:15.333 --> 12:17.917
"I've watched you at school

12:18.000 --> 12:19.291
"outside your house.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.250
"In fact, I'm watching you
right now."

12:26.959 --> 12:27.875
Um...

12:29.583 --> 12:31.166
Uh...stalker?

12:36.625 --> 12:40.417
"Always, Romeo."

12:49.792 --> 12:53.041
- "Always, Romeo."
- Kim was needy.

12:53.125 --> 12:57.083
She was loving that card with
all the sentiments and
whatnot.

12:57.166 --> 12:58.959
Thanks for your insight, Rick.

12:59.041 --> 13:01.458
Hey, wish I could
tell you more, but..

13:01.542 --> 13:03.750
Right, you're not her boyfriend.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.083
So maybe those online chats

13:08.166 --> 13:10.208
really weren't
between Kim and Rick.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.250
They were between her
and a secret admirer.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.333
Romeo.

13:20.125 --> 13:24.208
Tech unit recovered the shadow
drives off the Jacobi
computers.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.458
It's a mess, but they found the
messages Adam was mad about.

13:27.542 --> 13:28.750
Who was Kim writing to?

13:28.834 --> 13:30.917
Montague01.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.542
That's Romeo.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.000
I know my Shakespeare.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.083
'Same guy who Kim
claims shot her.'

13:37.166 --> 13:38.625
Messages go on for a month..

13:38.709 --> 13:41.041
...then all online
communication stops.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.208
Week later,
he sends her the rose.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.250
What's that?

13:44.333 --> 13:45.625
'Photo Kim sent him.'

13:45.709 --> 13:47.500
(Vera)
'High school insignia.'

13:47.583 --> 13:50.166
Could be how he tracked her,
sent her the flower.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.417
These two would chat for hours.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.542
All this soul-baring stuff.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.417
This guy's rap is
they're like Romeo and
Juliet.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.000
Meant to be together. It's fate.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.333
- Did Kim respond to that?
- Yep.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.792
Till his messages took
a turn for the loony

14:04.875 --> 14:07.333
a few weeks before the murders.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.709
"I see you crying
in your bathroom at night.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.583
"Your family brings you
so much pain.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.875
'"If they were gone, we could
love each other wholly.'

14:15.959 --> 14:18.542
"Violent delights
have violent ends."

14:19.917 --> 14:21.750
He's offering to get
rid of her family.

14:21.834 --> 14:24.000
Declaration of his love.

14:24.083 --> 14:26.709
She stopped returning
his messages at that point.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.041
Yeah, but maybe it was too late.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.583
Romeo decided
to take out the Capulets.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.959
"Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou?"

14:38.542 --> 14:40.750
I knew the man
who shot my family?

14:40.834 --> 14:42.417
(Rush)
'You talked to him
on the computer'

14:42.500 --> 14:43.583
every night for months.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.959
'Told him you were lonely.'

14:46.041 --> 14:48.041
- Lonely?
- You ever meet him?

14:48.125 --> 14:50.792
- Romeo?
- I don't think I'd do
that.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.625
Uh, he watched you some nights.
Outside the house.

14:53.709 --> 14:57.041
(Valens)
'Saw you crying
in the bathroom.'

14:57.125 --> 14:59.166
Bathroom?

15:01.417 --> 15:02.750
I used to hide there.

15:02.834 --> 15:04.959
Hide? From what?

15:05.041 --> 15:06.875
I remember steam on the windows.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.667
I could hear voices. I..

15:09.750 --> 15:11.083
I wanted to disappear.

15:11.166 --> 15:12.792
What were you hiding from, Kim?

15:12.875 --> 15:15.792
I tried to call someone,
but I didn't have any
friends.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.709
(Emily)
'Because you don't tell me
what's going on with you.'

15:17.792 --> 15:21.917
- 'And I'm trying to help!'
- 'Just figure this out
alone!'

15:44.583 --> 15:46.917
(Romeo)
'Did you like the rose?'

15:47.000 --> 15:49.500
- Who are you?
- 'Did you?'

15:49.583 --> 15:52.375
Liked the card.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.041
'Sorry your parents
are fighting.'

15:55.125 --> 15:57.709
I'm used to it.

15:57.792 --> 16:00.709
'I know you wanted
to call someone and cry.'

16:00.792 --> 16:03.291
'But there was no one to call.'

16:03.375 --> 16:05.291
How'd you know I wanted
to call someone?

16:05.375 --> 16:07.917
'Because...I'm watching you.'

16:16.458 --> 16:17.959
I see you.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.041
'Sort of.'

16:20.125 --> 16:21.375
I'm your Romeo.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.041
'Come to rescue you.'

16:24.792 --> 16:26.542
Why do you care?

16:26.625 --> 16:30.041
I mean, why do you like a
girl
you've never even met?

16:30.125 --> 16:34.041
'Cause...I understand you.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.375
'Wanting someone to
really ask you how you are'

16:36.458 --> 16:39.250
'and care about the answer.'

16:39.333 --> 16:41.417
'I want that, too.'

16:41.500 --> 16:43.709
How are you, Romeo?

16:45.667 --> 16:48.291
Better..

16:48.375 --> 16:50.709
'...than I used to be.'

16:50.792 --> 16:52.917
'I'm in love.'

16:53.000 --> 16:54.417
Really?

17:03.333 --> 17:05.250
'Draw an arrow through it.'

17:05.333 --> 17:06.625
Why?

17:06.709 --> 17:08.917
'Cupid's bow.'

17:16.667 --> 17:18.125
- Good night, Kim.
- Don't go.

17:27.250 --> 17:30.542
I can't believe
I talked to him like that.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.875
You saw red and
yellow
lights in the yard?

17:34.291 --> 17:36.959
Stuart's laser gun
had red lights.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.125
Yellow lights could've been
from another gun.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.834
'Maybe he had a friend over?'

17:40.917 --> 17:42.583
(Valens)
'Neighbor's kid?'

17:42.667 --> 17:44.750
Could be he got a look at Romeo.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.709
I know that wasn't easy.
But thanks.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.208
Who sent this?

17:54.291 --> 17:56.333
I don't know.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.291
It was him, wasn't it?

18:22.500 --> 18:25.083
Put a police detail
on Kim. 'Round the
clock.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.542
Any luck tracking Romeo?

18:27.625 --> 18:30.625
Canvas at the school was a bust.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.917
No high schoolers
using his moniker?

18:33.000 --> 18:36.166
And no luck tracing the Jacobi
phone records to our stalker.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.917
Looking into their
personal cells now.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.917
(Stillman)
Thanks for comin'
back in, Martin.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.500
Sure.

18:43.583 --> 18:47.041
You and Stuart played laser
tag
in the front yard at nights?

18:47.125 --> 18:48.583
Am I in trouble?

18:48.667 --> 18:50.083
No, why would you
be in trouble?

18:50.166 --> 18:51.667
(Stillman)
'Jeff, if you have something'

18:51.750 --> 18:55.000
to tell us about the
Jacobis,
we won't get mad.

18:57.542 --> 18:58.583
Um..

18:58.667 --> 19:01.041
The night that Stuart died..

19:01.125 --> 19:03.291
I went over to his house.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.083
- What?
- To play laser tag.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.458
And you saw someone
outside the house?

19:07.542 --> 19:09.542
No.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.250
Someone inside.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.375
Jeff! Gotcha!
Now you got to get me.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.875
(Emily)
It's gettin' late,
guys.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.291
We're all hittin' the hay.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.875
I can watch them
if you want to go to bed, Em.

19:22.959 --> 19:25.959
Oh, you said you were tired.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.041
The hell is that?

19:35.917 --> 19:37.959
Oh, my God.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.083
Look, dad.

19:52.333 --> 19:53.875
Who did this, Kim?

19:53.959 --> 19:56.542
Romeo, I think.

19:56.625 --> 19:57.500
Romeo?

19:57.583 --> 19:58.667
Is that who you
were messaging?

19:58.750 --> 20:00.250
I never messaged
anybody, dad!

20:00.333 --> 20:02.375
I saw your screen name, Kim,
and now he's been in our house!

20:02.458 --> 20:04.625
- You need to stop lying to
me!
- She's not!

20:06.834 --> 20:10.875
Kim didn't send
those messages. I
did.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.166
Why didn't you tell me?

20:34.250 --> 20:37.125
Emily was posing as her
own
daughter on the internet?

20:37.208 --> 20:39.333
She brought the stalker
into their home.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.667
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:54.750 --> 20:58.000
Any luck tracking the slide
show
on the Jacobis' computer?

20:58.083 --> 20:59.291
Nope.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.500
Romeo's a hacker
pain in the ass.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.834
Got something off
of Kim's cell
phone.

21:03.917 --> 21:05.333
One she wasn't
supposed to be using?

21:05.417 --> 21:07.333
Teenage girls don't
listen
to their parents.

21:07.417 --> 21:08.583
That's good news for us.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.250
She made a call,
night of the
shooting.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.333
To Romeo?

21:11.417 --> 21:13.750
No, to her
friend
with benefits.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.667
Rick.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.625
Homeslice forgot
to mention that.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.333
Right. Hey, you see
Lil this morning?

21:20.417 --> 21:21.917
No.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.041
Everything okay?

21:38.125 --> 21:40.125
It was unlocked.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.542
My mom died.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.250
Last night.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.500
Oh, no, Lil.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.291
I found her.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.583
She was alone when..

22:07.125 --> 22:09.250
'...I sat here with her.'

22:11.458 --> 22:12.500
She was so..

22:13.750 --> 22:14.792
...still.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.625
She called the office.

22:23.625 --> 22:24.917
I told her to call my cell.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.625
If she had, she
wouldn't have died alone.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.667
You got to know
it wasn't your fault.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.291
I should've been here, Scotty.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.250
Lil, you did everything
you could.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.583
Never said goodbye.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.417
I'm here for you.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.375
'Anything.'

22:48.458 --> 22:50.458
'You know that.'

22:51.750 --> 22:54.542
I just want to be
alone now, okay?

22:54.625 --> 22:55.667
Yeah.

22:58.375 --> 22:59.417
Okay.

23:10.542 --> 23:13.625
Lil, you need me, just say..

23:13.709 --> 23:15.667
"Hey."

23:15.750 --> 23:16.917
And I'll be there.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.333
Kim called you
the night of the murder.

23:43.417 --> 23:45.500
- Got the phone records.
- I didn't kill anybody.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.667
You saying that ain't
quite
good enough for us,
Rick.

23:47.750 --> 23:49.333
She called me.
You're right.

23:49.417 --> 23:50.500
Yeah, we know.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.333
She was crying about her family.

23:52.417 --> 23:53.917
So you head over there
thinking she's
vulnerable

23:54.000 --> 23:55.333
up for some easy play?

23:55.417 --> 23:56.959
That is not why I went
to her house.

23:57.041 --> 23:59.417
Then, why'd you go, genius,
the night of the murders?

23:59.500 --> 24:00.834
'Cause she was crying

24:00.917 --> 24:03.667
and I wanted
to make sure she was okay.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.834
'She was a really
sweet girl.'

24:05.917 --> 24:09.834
- You know, I--
- Don't say you liked her.

24:09.917 --> 24:12.667
I kind of got attached, okay?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.542
Kim was
a good person.

24:14.625 --> 24:15.834
Maybe she was
a little
depressed

24:15.917 --> 24:17.750
but her
parents,
like, ignored
her.

24:17.834 --> 24:19.166
Sounds like you're
defending her, Rick.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.417
Why would you have
to defend Kim?

24:22.583 --> 24:25.500
Like I said, she was depressed.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.375
(Adam)
'I'm getting rid
of these damn computers.'

24:30.709 --> 24:32.583
I'm sorry, Adam.

24:33.583 --> 24:34.667
I'm sorry, Kim.

24:36.625 --> 24:37.792
- It's okay, Mom.
- No.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.875
(Adam)
'No, honey.'

24:41.959 --> 24:44.166
You don't have to tell
your mother that putting you

24:44.250 --> 24:45.291
putting all of us in da--

24:45.375 --> 24:47.083
Dad, stop!

24:47.166 --> 24:49.709
Don't let your daughter think
this is okay.

24:51.542 --> 24:54.750
I went on the site thinking..

24:54.834 --> 24:57.750
...maybe I'd connect
with some old friends.

24:57.834 --> 24:59.417
- Okay. Okay
- And..

24:59.500 --> 25:01.875
I went to
make
my profile

25:02.000 --> 25:04.792
and all of the
pictures
of me were..

25:09.458 --> 25:11.542
And I don't want
to be this person

25:11.625 --> 25:13.667
whose husband
doesn't think

25:13.750 --> 25:17.208
she's appealing anymore,
and her kids think

25:17.291 --> 25:20.375
she's boring
and annoying,
so..

25:23.667 --> 25:25.208
I used to look like you.

25:27.917 --> 25:31.333
I used to be so happy
and vibrant like you.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.917
Is that what you think?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.333
That I'm happy?

25:38.333 --> 25:39.667
Well, yes.

25:41.542 --> 25:42.625
You don't know me.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.667
Only Romeo really knows me.

25:54.542 --> 25:55.583
Honey?

26:22.417 --> 26:23.583
Kim had a gun?

26:25.583 --> 26:27.750
She tried to talk
to me sometimes

26:27.834 --> 26:31.417
about how...bad she felt.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.667
And I only made
things worse.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.792
I could have helped her and..

26:38.875 --> 26:40.875
Maybe the Jacobis
would have lived.

26:51.667 --> 26:53.000
Lil, I heard.

26:53.083 --> 26:56.083
Um...I'm so sorry.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.166
I need to be here.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.333
Keep busy.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.750
Kim, come with me.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.959
Just sit here.
It'll be a while.

27:28.333 --> 27:31.208
Ever read "Romeo and Juliet?"

27:31.291 --> 27:33.709
Crazy kids, those two.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.417
Do anything for love.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.333
Well, kind of like you.

27:40.417 --> 27:41.333
I don't understand.

27:41.417 --> 27:43.709
Well, Rick saw you with the gun.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.166
Gun?

27:45.250 --> 27:46.542
What are you saying?

27:46.625 --> 27:48.417
Is that the real
reason
you can't remember?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.583
- 'Cause you don't want to?
- Why are you saying this?

27:50.667 --> 27:52.291
I would never do anything bad
to them.

27:52.375 --> 27:54.625
Your mom put your photo
on the internet.

27:54.709 --> 27:56.333
Pretended
to be you.

27:57.834 --> 28:00.917
- That's crazy.
- Your family didn't know you.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.208
They
didn't
even try.

28:02.291 --> 28:04.417
I didn't hate my family.
I wouldn't hurt them.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.792
No?

28:05.875 --> 28:07.083
How do you know?

28:11.959 --> 28:13.792
I wanted to hurt myself..

28:15.458 --> 28:16.750
...not them.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.250
Kim.

28:25.333 --> 28:26.792
Oh, my God!

28:26.875 --> 28:27.917
'Adam!'

28:29.458 --> 28:31.417
- 'What?'
- I thought it was locked up.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.041
There was someone
in the house, so I took it
out.

28:34.125 --> 28:35.667
Kim, sweetheart...
Stuart, go to your
room.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.750
No, let him stay.

28:40.667 --> 28:43.417
We can't stand to watch
the two people we love
most

28:43.500 --> 28:45.458
in the world tear
each other apart.

28:47.709 --> 28:50.291
So you're tired
from work or you need
work.

28:50.375 --> 28:53.291
Is that more
important
than our family?

28:56.583 --> 28:58.458
Fix your problem.

28:58.542 --> 28:59.792
It's not that simple, Kim.

28:59.875 --> 29:01.792
We were happy
before once.

29:01.875 --> 29:04.625
Remember that time
in Cincinnati?

29:04.709 --> 29:06.250
The tornado.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.125
Maybe we should
make some popcorn.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.375
That's a good idea.

29:23.291 --> 29:24.375
I'll do it.

29:25.333 --> 29:27.125
I know where it is.

29:45.709 --> 29:46.917
'Dad!'

29:49.959 --> 29:51.333
You saw him, Kim.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.083
You know who he is, don't you?

29:56.125 --> 29:57.208
Who is he?

30:03.375 --> 30:04.959
You're not going
to take her from me.

30:05.792 --> 30:06.834
Not again.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.250
Hey!

30:13.000 --> 30:14.375
I'll kill her
before I let you do it.

30:15.458 --> 30:16.875
I'll kill all of you.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.250
No one's going to get hurt,
Ed.
We're going to work it out.

30:36.333 --> 30:37.875
Shut up!

30:37.959 --> 30:40.917
Put your handcuffs on now.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.208
Cuff yourselves
to the door.

30:42.291 --> 30:43.583
You, file cabinet.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.208
You, take
the keys!

30:45.291 --> 30:46.792
'Now!'

30:51.792 --> 30:54.083
Come on.
Let's go, lady.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.542
- Get his keys!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.917
I said shut up!

30:59.000 --> 31:00.417
Listen to me, Ed.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.375
I want to help you.

31:02.458 --> 31:03.959
'I don't want anyone
getting hurt.'

31:04.041 --> 31:06.083
You understand?

31:06.166 --> 31:08.333
Give me the keys now.

31:08.417 --> 31:10.583
Get me a helicopter
on the roof.

31:12.375 --> 31:13.875
I can make that happen.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.166
But it's going to take time.

31:18.375 --> 31:20.000
And I need
to make a call.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.959
We got a situation in Homicide.

31:37.041 --> 31:39.875
I need to talk
to your tactical commander.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.458
Get the sharpshooters
into position.

32:11.542 --> 32:12.709
Third floor,
east side.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.625
Hostage taker's
a guy named Ed Marteson.

32:16.709 --> 32:18.333
Just got texted
by someone
inside.

32:18.417 --> 32:20.458
Marteson smuggled a .38
in with the wheelchair.

32:21.583 --> 32:22.750
(Kat)
It's Vera again.

32:22.834 --> 32:25.500
"Hostage taker
at southeast
window."

32:25.583 --> 32:26.750
Southeast window.

32:26.834 --> 32:29.500
If your field of fire
is clean, take the shot.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.458
Hey, you miss, you're going
to
kill one of ours.

32:36.542 --> 32:38.542
Back off,
detective.
Let me do my job.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.250
And that's why I got
that job, Kim.

32:50.250 --> 32:52.125
To be close to you.

32:52.208 --> 32:55.834
So my face'd be the first
you saw when you woke up.

32:58.458 --> 33:01.166
(Stillman)
'Ed, listen to me now.'

33:01.250 --> 33:03.250
Let the others
go.
I'll stay.

33:03.333 --> 33:04.375
No!

33:05.709 --> 33:08.500
'No one is going
anywhere.'

33:11.417 --> 33:12.750
Do you feel happy now?

33:13.792 --> 33:17.166
Just tell me
because, because..

33:19.166 --> 33:20.875
...that's all I wanted.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.250
That's why I did this.

33:25.166 --> 33:26.875
You're disgusting.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.750
She's just scared, Ed.

33:44.333 --> 33:45.917
Helicopter's coming right now.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.792
It'll come from
behind that building.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.792
'To your right.'

34:10.417 --> 34:11.583
(Rush)
'Hey!'

34:18.542 --> 34:20.583
I hate liars.

34:20.667 --> 34:21.709
Hey!

34:26.875 --> 34:27.917
You're gonna die.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.125
She doesn't love you!

34:30.333 --> 34:31.542
She doesn't love you.

34:31.625 --> 34:33.125
She didn't
even write those e-mails.

34:34.208 --> 34:35.792
You want to say that again?

34:38.208 --> 34:39.500
(man over radio)
'Shots fired from inside.'

34:39.583 --> 34:41.959
'One hostage down.
White male, 50s.'

34:42.041 --> 34:43.083
That's our
lieutenant.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.291
Stand down.
Stand down.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.792
I told you not to fire,
you idiot.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.792
- You understand I outrank you?
- Let go of me!

34:50.750 --> 34:51.750
I'm getting in there.

34:51.834 --> 34:52.792
What about him?

34:52.875 --> 34:55.417
Screw that guy.

34:59.583 --> 35:01.125
Lil.

35:01.208 --> 35:02.417
They lied to you.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.500
- But I won't.
- Get away from me.

35:04.583 --> 35:06.250
Listen, you got to get
away from those windows

35:06.333 --> 35:07.667
or they'll kill you.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.417
There's no windows in there.
You'll be safe.

35:20.917 --> 35:22.417
You're coming, too.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.083
You don't need her.

35:32.792 --> 35:33.875
I'm going.

35:50.792 --> 35:52.291
There's a room
behind that.

35:53.834 --> 35:54.917
It's safer.

35:56.792 --> 35:58.458
You better not be lying to me.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.500
(Rush)
'They can see you
in here.'

36:02.583 --> 36:03.834
There, they can't.

36:05.208 --> 36:06.834
Come in and I'll kill them both!

36:09.792 --> 36:11.500
Shut the door.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.583
John.

36:22.667 --> 36:23.750
'He's going into shock.'

36:25.000 --> 36:26.250
Nick, hurry up.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.208
Bullet went clean through.
Let's get it dressed.

36:40.333 --> 36:41.583
Hang in there boss.

36:54.291 --> 36:55.875
Hey.

36:55.959 --> 36:57.875
- Where's Lil?
- In there.

37:03.041 --> 37:06.041
I used to be an EMT.

37:06.125 --> 37:09.625
Which means I knew
how to care for you

37:09.709 --> 37:11.291
when you got hurt.

37:12.875 --> 37:15.083
You got to know
that it's fate
with us.

37:15.166 --> 37:18.208
Look...I have to make a call.

37:19.417 --> 37:20.542
Put it down.

37:20.625 --> 37:22.792
You want to get
out of here, right?

37:22.875 --> 37:24.792
They're gonna come in
if I don't call.

37:26.250 --> 37:29.125
Trust me.
Okay?

37:39.709 --> 37:42.333
(Lilly)
'I need a helicopter
on the roof, right now.'

37:42.417 --> 37:44.250
We're outside
the interview rooms.

37:44.333 --> 37:47.500
You can't see in here,
so don't try anything.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.208
You're not
in the interview rooms?

37:50.291 --> 37:51.333
You're in observation?

37:51.417 --> 37:52.625
(Lilly)
'That's what I said.'

37:54.291 --> 37:55.959
What do you want me to do?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.041
Hey.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.250
'You hear me?'

38:02.333 --> 38:04.000
'Hey.'

38:04.083 --> 38:05.667
You want me to come in.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.125
Get him to turn away
from the two-ways and stay
down.

38:10.417 --> 38:11.500
They're, uh.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.542
- They're on their way.
- You're lying!

38:16.625 --> 38:18.583
Maybe I should
just kill you
now.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.750
Why do you take such good care
of someone who doesn't love you?

38:24.834 --> 38:26.667
She does.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.875
You're trying to make her
into a different person

38:28.959 --> 38:31.959
who loves you
the way you want to be loved

38:32.041 --> 38:33.875
but it's not
gonna happen.

38:33.959 --> 38:35.291
She wrote
things to
me..

38:36.458 --> 38:38.291
...that you don't know.

38:38.375 --> 38:42.417
See...you hold on
to the good things

38:42.500 --> 38:45.208
but there were bad things, too.

38:45.291 --> 38:46.375
Right, Ed?

38:51.959 --> 38:53.250
She rejected you.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.208
'She rejected you.'

38:57.291 --> 38:59.500
- That's not true.
- Well, you shot her.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.834
Why do you think you did that?

39:09.375 --> 39:11.125
She called me her Romeo.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.375
Promised to love me forever.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.166
But she lied.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.709
'It's me.'

39:28.417 --> 39:29.917
It's me, Romeo.

39:30.000 --> 39:30.917
Dad.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.834
No one ever rescued me
from my family

39:33.917 --> 39:36.750
but I'm gonna do it for you
because I love you, Kim.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.291
No, don't..

39:38.375 --> 39:39.959
- Don't!
- Please!

39:41.291 --> 39:42.792
No!

39:42.875 --> 39:44.792
Oh, my God, Adam!

39:44.875 --> 39:45.875
Mom!

39:48.375 --> 39:50.333
You've caused her so much pain.

39:50.417 --> 39:51.959
But not anymore.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.500
No, it's not true!
Don't do it. Don't.

39:57.375 --> 39:59.875
You-you can take me.

39:59.959 --> 40:03.667
You can take me
but just let my kids out,
okay?

40:05.041 --> 40:07.041
Just let them go out
the back, alright?

40:08.625 --> 40:09.792
I don't want you.

40:11.792 --> 40:12.959
No!

40:23.250 --> 40:25.667
I love you.

40:25.750 --> 40:26.875
Do you feel better?

40:28.250 --> 40:29.375
'Cause they're gone.

40:30.500 --> 40:31.625
They're gone.

40:35.083 --> 40:36.375
No more
crying,
my love.

40:37.291 --> 40:38.375
My Juliet.

40:41.875 --> 40:44.041
- Kim?
- Get away from me!

40:45.208 --> 40:46.917
But you said you loved me.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.166
Don't touch me!
I hate you!

40:50.250 --> 40:52.667
But I love you!

40:52.750 --> 40:53.834
Always.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.166
Romeo.

41:02.125 --> 41:03.750
You have to let her go.

41:06.417 --> 41:09.709
It's not gonna be how you
wanted it to be, it's over.

41:09.792 --> 41:11.125
It's over.

41:11.208 --> 41:13.250
You don't think
somebody could love me?

41:15.625 --> 41:17.291
Huh?

41:17.375 --> 41:18.458
You don't?

41:19.750 --> 41:21.625
You want to shoot me?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.333
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me now.

41:24.417 --> 41:25.458
You're gonna die.

41:25.542 --> 41:27.417
Then do it
already!
Shoot me!

41:29.125 --> 41:30.041
Do it now!

41:41.000 --> 41:42.041
Lil!

41:43.792 --> 41:45.166
(Rush)
'He got me.'

41:45.250 --> 41:46.792
Lil.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.750
Get the paramedics.

41:54.333 --> 41:55.750
Get the paramedics!

44:24.333 --> 44:25.542
Ma.
