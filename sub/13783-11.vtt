01:38.311 --> 01:42.543
A slob mick cop
in Chicago

01:42.582 --> 01:45.278
gonna take me off
for $35

01:45.318 --> 01:47.115
just because
he thinks he can.

01:47.154 --> 01:50.453
'Cause when he comes around
for his free fuckin' meal

01:50.490 --> 01:54.654
and to have his prick sucked and collect
his weekly 20 fuckin' dollars

01:54.694 --> 01:56.685
from the woman that runs
the whorehouse,

01:56.730 --> 01:59.995
I'm there buying girls
to bring out to the camps.

02:01.435 --> 02:03.960
I knifed
the tub of guts.

02:04.004 --> 02:06.370
That's what this cunt
of a magistrate's

02:06.406 --> 02:08.067
shaking me down over,

02:08.108 --> 02:10.633
having already
taken $5,000

02:10.676 --> 02:12.770
to have
the warrant lifted.

02:12.813 --> 02:15.577
Can you do business
with his bagman?

02:15.615 --> 02:18.812
I'll fuckin' find
that out shortly.

02:20.353 --> 02:24.619
Or if you're never gonna be able
to fuckin' operate in peace.

02:27.794 --> 02:29.421
What should I know?

02:29.463 --> 02:32.125
Bullock's rode out with that
Hostetler from the livery.

02:32.165 --> 02:34.929
Farnum's slithered
his way across here.

02:37.704 --> 02:39.171
JeweI just left.

02:39.206 --> 02:41.037
Where the fuck
is JeweI goin'?

02:41.074 --> 02:43.065
I don't know.

02:46.646 --> 02:49.672
Take half a day off if you feeI like.
Go see that child.

02:49.716 --> 02:53.880
Venture out,
sally fuckin' forth, hmm?

02:55.155 --> 02:58.716
- Maybe I will.
- But now come back to bed.

04:20.140 --> 04:21.732
Who's sick?

04:21.774 --> 04:25.643
What's he doin' making
you walk to tell me?

04:25.679 --> 04:27.476
I came here
on my own, Doc.

04:27.514 --> 04:30.972
I got something
I want to show you. It's a book.

04:31.017 --> 04:35.215
Oh no, I don't read goddamn
books on the Civlll War.

04:35.255 --> 04:38.622
- Look!
- I don't need to look.

04:38.658 --> 04:40.182
I was goddamn there.

04:41.461 --> 04:44.862
But it'll help me
walk better.

04:48.902 --> 04:51.769
Okay, you're referring
to the brace on his leg.

04:51.805 --> 04:53.670
Yes.

04:58.678 --> 05:01.169
For your
information, JeweI,

05:01.214 --> 05:04.945
that boy in the drawing
was goddamn able-bodied

05:04.985 --> 05:06.646
before he got
his leg shot up,

05:06.686 --> 05:09.553
not born with difficulties
and hardships

05:09.589 --> 05:13.355
that got no cure
and took from you

05:13.393 --> 05:17.193
the coordination a brace
like that would require.

05:17.230 --> 05:19.926
I was just lookin'
at the picture,

05:19.966 --> 05:23.595
and draggin' my leg
really makes Al crazy.

05:23.637 --> 05:25.901
Fuck Al.

05:27.073 --> 05:29.041
Everybody's
got limits.

05:29.075 --> 05:31.509
You draggin'
your leg is yours.

05:32.846 --> 05:35.940
- I'm sorry.
- What do you apologize for?

05:35.982 --> 05:39.509
Don't- don't
apologize to me.

05:42.922 --> 05:44.116
Lemme-

05:44.157 --> 05:46.022
let me hold onto
this for a while.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.525
Thank you.

05:56.302 --> 05:59.203
Momentous!

05:59.239 --> 06:02.072
The long-awaited day!

06:02.108 --> 06:04.167
Oh, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

06:04.210 --> 06:06.508
Oh God, oh God,
oh, yes, yes.

06:08.448 --> 06:10.575
Uh, carefuI, carefuI,
carefuI, carefuI!

06:11.685 --> 06:14.017
Now, sir, we must
confirm the contents

06:14.054 --> 06:15.646
of this precious cargo.

06:18.825 --> 06:20.759
Oh God- philistine.

06:20.794 --> 06:22.421
Ah, Joseph,

06:22.462 --> 06:24.987
what you see here

06:25.031 --> 06:28.057
is an American optical
back-focus single-swing

06:28.101 --> 06:33.004
with a Meyer Gorlitz
trioplan 210mm lens.

06:33.039 --> 06:36.770
The finest photographic apparatus
manufactured in this country.

06:39.479 --> 06:42.812
What William Henry Fox Talbot
could have achieved

06:42.849 --> 06:45.716
in service of this
fine apparatus.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.312
Oh, God! Agh!

06:55.061 --> 06:57.427
Oh, God,
yes, carefuI, carefuI.

06:58.631 --> 07:02.032
- Good day, sir.
- Ow. Damn.

07:02.068 --> 07:04.332
- What's wrong?
- I bit my d-

07:04.370 --> 07:05.928
Oh.
Sorry.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.844
Leaned forward to give
that fella passage

07:12.879 --> 07:14.437
and bit
my damn tongue.

07:14.481 --> 07:17.473
Knocked off
my chewin' angle.

07:17.517 --> 07:20.850
- Is it bleeding?
- I don't want to look.

07:20.887 --> 07:23.082
Might upset
the child.

07:25.892 --> 07:29.225
Anyways, maybe a different
way's opened up, Charlie,

07:29.262 --> 07:31.492
as far as me getting
backing for my brotheI.

07:31.531 --> 07:33.226
Aha.

07:34.634 --> 07:37.569
I understood the question
was location,

07:37.604 --> 07:41.267
but glad to hear
the backin' problem's solved.

07:41.307 --> 07:44.037
I think, uh, I've been
finicky over the location

07:44.077 --> 07:46.511
'cause I wasn't comfortable
with the backing.

07:46.546 --> 07:48.411
I'll tell you
one thing-

07:49.749 --> 07:52.115
I ain't making too many
friends in this camp

07:52.152 --> 07:55.451
in my capacity
as fire marshal.

07:57.557 --> 08:00.822
We're through the easy picking's
on that outcrop, ma'am.

08:00.860 --> 08:04.159
I'll wade around that creek
as long as you like.

08:04.197 --> 08:06.893
You want to make your claim
show its colors,

08:06.933 --> 08:08.798
you're gonna need
to sink a few shafts.

08:08.835 --> 08:11.167
I'm close to suggesting
that we proceed.

08:11.204 --> 08:13.798
Meaning my use
to you is near a finish.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.307
No!

08:15.341 --> 08:17.536
I told you, Mrs. Garret,
such as it is,

08:17.577 --> 08:19.306
my expertise
ain't underground.

08:19.345 --> 08:21.870
I want you still
to supervise.

08:21.915 --> 08:25.681
I trust you, Ellsworth,
as an honorable man.

08:25.718 --> 08:28.312
I take great pleasure
in your company.

08:31.157 --> 08:32.556
I feeI the same.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.226
I look forward
to our breakfasts,

08:36.261 --> 08:38.491
and I'll just say once,

08:38.530 --> 08:41.864
I know I'm too damn
old for ya.

08:43.269 --> 08:45.237
Button!

08:47.140 --> 08:48.732
Oh my goodness.

08:56.482 --> 08:57.779
I can't be...

08:59.052 --> 09:01.384
I take
a father's liberty.

09:01.421 --> 09:04.322
Mr. Ellsworth,
Mr. Russell.

09:04.357 --> 09:07.190
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

09:08.194 --> 09:10.162
Uh, and this
is Sophia.

09:10.196 --> 09:12.357
- Hello, Sophia.
- Hello.

09:12.398 --> 09:13.524
Your daughter?

09:13.566 --> 09:15.693
My ward.

09:16.870 --> 09:18.804
Any rate, pleasure
to meet you, sir.

09:18.838 --> 09:21.705
I'm honored to be
in your daughter's employ.

09:21.741 --> 09:25.370
And with your permission, ma'am,
I will take my leave.

09:25.411 --> 09:26.935
Uh, of course.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.073
And my plate...

09:29.115 --> 09:30.912
and my coffee...

09:30.950 --> 09:32.918
and my hat.

09:39.092 --> 09:40.787
Fine manners.

09:56.175 --> 09:57.767
Reverend Smith.

10:01.581 --> 10:03.446
How are you, sir?

10:03.483 --> 10:06.316
Andy Cramed,
Reverend.

10:06.352 --> 10:09.879
Mr. Cramed, you returned
to the setting of your recovery.

10:09.923 --> 10:11.584
Uh-huh.

10:12.592 --> 10:14.787
How have you
fared since?

10:14.827 --> 10:17.625
I've been trying out
the other camps.

10:17.664 --> 10:19.393
To what effect?

10:19.432 --> 10:22.060
No good effect,
Reverend.

10:22.101 --> 10:24.399
I see.

10:24.437 --> 10:26.029
How you feeling?

10:28.341 --> 10:30.434
As you see.

10:31.477 --> 10:34.708
The- the tent,
as you see,

10:34.747 --> 10:37.238
is in the process
of being dismantled.

10:37.283 --> 10:40.116
Our last tenant took
his leave yesterday.

10:40.153 --> 10:42.383
- Upright?
- He was upright, yes.

10:44.057 --> 10:46.218
His name escapes me.

10:47.593 --> 10:49.925
Dr. Cochran,
I believe, uh,

10:49.963 --> 10:54.195
is expected shortly,
I believe.

10:54.233 --> 10:56.258
I was asked to-

10:56.302 --> 11:00.136
to see to the packing of...

11:00.173 --> 11:02.733
certain liniments and...

11:04.877 --> 11:07.573
medicines.

11:07.613 --> 11:09.581
Are you not well,
Minister?

11:15.321 --> 11:17.789
Sometimes I'm
very well, indeed.

11:17.824 --> 11:20.349
My energy will return,

11:20.393 --> 11:23.226
or even an excess
of energy.

11:23.262 --> 11:25.856
At other times,
I'm not well,

11:25.898 --> 11:28.492
or excess of energy.

11:30.870 --> 11:32.428
How are you,
Mr. Cramed?

11:32.472 --> 11:36.306
Well, I backslid
in the other camps.

11:36.342 --> 11:38.970
At Gayville, I had
the best intentions,

11:39.012 --> 11:42.470
- and I wound up at dice.
- Oh, yes.

11:42.515 --> 11:45.382
At Elizabethtown,

11:45.418 --> 11:48.046
I wound up at dice-

11:48.087 --> 11:49.884
Oh, yes.

11:49.922 --> 11:52.254
Thought I'd try to work here
where I'd been good,

11:52.291 --> 11:54.191
but you're putting
the tent down.

11:57.430 --> 12:00.399
Ask God's help,
Mr. Cramed.

12:00.433 --> 12:05.063
Wherever you find yourself,
He will show you the path.

12:09.475 --> 12:11.966
Could you help me
to pray?

12:22.221 --> 12:23.848
Lord,

12:24.991 --> 12:29.325
grant that I may seek
rather to comfort

12:29.362 --> 12:32.024
than to be comforted,

12:32.065 --> 12:35.228
to understand
than to be understood...

12:36.969 --> 12:39.130
to love than
to be loved...

12:47.914 --> 12:49.609
And the rest
I forget.

13:01.494 --> 13:03.462
"Why don't you get
a haircut, Adams?

13:03.496 --> 13:05.896
Looks like your mama
fucked a monkey. "

13:05.932 --> 13:08.162
Just that affectionate?

13:08.201 --> 13:10.999
Yeah, I've never seen Al
warm up to anybody so quick.

13:12.205 --> 13:14.799
Which should persuade
you then of what?

13:14.841 --> 13:16.866
Well, you think
it's just tactics?

13:16.909 --> 13:19.434
The magistrate
Al counted on

13:19.479 --> 13:22.243
to be his advocate
in Yankton turned Judas.

13:22.281 --> 13:25.273
Adams is the magistrate's
bagman.

13:28.488 --> 13:31.582
Al is merely probing
Adams' willingness

13:31.624 --> 13:33.615
to betray
the magistrate.

13:33.659 --> 13:37.459
In turn, his warmth
is counterfeit.

13:57.049 --> 13:59.916
- Where the fuck were you?
- At the doc.

13:59.952 --> 14:02.011
Fix me a cup
of coffee.

14:07.894 --> 14:09.054
Morning.

14:12.098 --> 14:14.498
Shorn and groomed
to a fucking fare-thee-well.

14:14.534 --> 14:16.024
She'd never
recognize you-

14:16.068 --> 14:18.195
have to smell you all over
to know you was hers.

14:18.237 --> 14:20.068
My monkey mother.

14:20.106 --> 14:22.700
Take a table
out of the traffic, huh?

14:32.084 --> 14:35.053
Just that
affectionate.

14:37.123 --> 14:39.990
I trust you found
your accommodations satisfactory,

14:40.026 --> 14:41.493
Mr. Adams-
Silas.

14:41.527 --> 14:44.052
If not, they could
always be changed.

14:45.731 --> 14:47.562
Let me fucking pour.

14:48.868 --> 14:52.269
He's gotta make some
distance before sunset.

14:53.539 --> 14:55.268
What was your
purpose at Doc's?

14:55.308 --> 14:58.539
I'm knocked up.

15:01.948 --> 15:04.610
What message should
I take to the magistrate?

15:04.650 --> 15:07.710
No envelopes
and to fuck himself.

15:08.854 --> 15:10.788
I'm glad we had
occasion last night

15:10.823 --> 15:12.256
to spend
some time together,

15:12.291 --> 15:15.954
so when he asks
if this is tactics or true position,

15:15.995 --> 15:17.656
you'll know
what to say.

15:17.697 --> 15:20.427
- I'll know.
- You traveI safe.

15:21.601 --> 15:24.035
They believe you're
the man to deal with-

15:24.070 --> 15:25.628
Yankton.

15:28.140 --> 15:30.404
- I am.
- It's just the magistrate

15:30.443 --> 15:32.911
looking to earn
off that warrant.

15:32.945 --> 15:35.379
And no one else even
knows it's out on you.

15:35.414 --> 15:37.279
Maybe the magistrate
needs to die.

15:37.316 --> 15:38.806
Maybe he does.

15:38.851 --> 15:41.251
He won't come back here
without a resolution.

15:41.287 --> 15:42.982
He'll know what's
waiting for him.

15:43.022 --> 15:45.115
Maybe he needs
to die there.

15:45.157 --> 15:46.488
Maybe he should.

15:46.525 --> 15:49.392
And the person
who did it

15:49.428 --> 15:52.727
would only be at the beginning
of his usefulness to me.

15:52.765 --> 15:56.496
If that person didn't come back
with the warrant on you quashed,

15:56.535 --> 15:59.333
he would be a fooI not to think
he'd be the next one killed.

15:59.372 --> 16:02.307
That's why he'd be so usefuI
to me thinking that far ahead.

16:02.341 --> 16:03.638
Make your offer.

16:03.676 --> 16:06.201
A thousand for the cocksucker
proved dead,

16:06.245 --> 16:08.304
a thousand for the warrant
proved lifted.

16:08.347 --> 16:10.577
A thousand
and a thousand.

16:10.616 --> 16:14.313
- Think I am a fucking monkey?
- You thought there would be 20 in it?

16:14.353 --> 16:17.754
Kill Clagett and get you
out from underneath that warrant?

16:17.790 --> 16:19.985
You're fucking right
there's 20.

16:20.026 --> 16:22.460
Do it for two.
You've got to believe

16:22.495 --> 16:25.430
the job would open the door
to your future,

16:25.464 --> 16:28.797
and you gotta believe you'd make
your ass hundreds of thousands

16:28.834 --> 16:31.200
back and forth
between here and Yankton.

16:34.607 --> 16:36.905
2,000.

16:43.983 --> 16:46.781
I put him in a room
above the privy.

16:52.191 --> 16:55.285
I always thought it was
gonna end like this, Button.

16:55.328 --> 16:57.262
A rooming house

16:57.296 --> 16:59.924
in a mining camp
on Indian territory,

16:59.965 --> 17:02.866
you caring for
a Norwegian foundling

17:02.902 --> 17:05.871
and operating
a bonanza gold claim.

17:09.608 --> 17:11.200
And you, Daddy?

17:11.242 --> 17:15.042
Uh, always a little
sketchy about me.

17:16.615 --> 17:18.845
I hope I'm here
to help.

17:20.118 --> 17:21.950
Oh, that would be
my room key. Sophia?

17:28.227 --> 17:30.252
- Room seven.
- Thank you, sir.

17:32.631 --> 17:35.464
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, little one.

17:37.103 --> 17:39.936
Oh my goodness,
what's that behind your ear?

17:41.607 --> 17:44.269
Don't you ever clean
behind your ear?

17:49.181 --> 17:51.012
Mmm.

17:51.050 --> 17:53.951
Does caring
for Sophia please you?

17:55.087 --> 17:56.076
More with each day.

17:56.122 --> 17:58.420
And do you have
any of the gold?

17:58.457 --> 18:01.085
As it happens...

18:18.110 --> 18:21.637
The well-mannered
Mr. Ellsworth says these abound?

18:21.680 --> 18:23.238
Yes.

18:31.624 --> 18:35.082
There's some talk
that you did Brom in.

18:36.362 --> 18:38.091
From his parents?

18:38.130 --> 18:40.655
They have raised
the possibility.

18:42.501 --> 18:45.402
As it happens, I was not
present when Brom fell.

18:45.438 --> 18:47.838
You have to admit,
it's a suspicious sequence-

18:47.873 --> 18:51.070
- The man who was is in camp.
- -given their view of the marriage.

18:51.110 --> 18:53.408
I doubt he tells
the true story of how Brom died,

18:53.446 --> 18:55.539
but he would verify
that I wasn't there.

18:57.082 --> 18:58.674
I didn't mean
to upset you.

19:01.487 --> 19:03.819
It's always about
the money, Button.

19:03.856 --> 19:06.154
In certain circles.

19:06.192 --> 19:08.160
But not here, hmm?

19:08.194 --> 19:10.685
I suppose here,
as well.

19:11.797 --> 19:13.822
In certain circles.

19:16.669 --> 19:19.160
Mr. Ellsworth
being the exception?

19:23.108 --> 19:26.544
Mr. Ellsworth was engaged
by a Mr. Seth Bullock,

19:26.579 --> 19:28.240
who's been
steadfast and kind.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.748
And when did your path
cross Mr. Bullock's?

19:30.783 --> 19:33.217
Before Brom's
accident or after?

19:33.252 --> 19:36.744
Mr. Bullock was asked
to look to my interests

19:36.789 --> 19:38.552
by Wild Bill Hickok.

19:38.591 --> 19:42.823
Who, if I recall
your reading habits,

19:42.862 --> 19:46.559
has been an acquaintance
of yours since childhood.

19:49.401 --> 19:51.926
I would very much like
to meet this Mr. Bullock...

19:51.971 --> 19:54.531
nearly as much as
I'd like to wash.

19:56.876 --> 19:58.366
Daddy.

19:59.778 --> 20:01.143
Ah.

20:04.817 --> 20:06.808
I'm glad to see you.

20:12.458 --> 20:15.894
Stovepipe directly
into wood,

20:15.928 --> 20:19.159
no clearance
or sheet iron in-between.

20:19.198 --> 20:21.723
Well, what's
the significance?

20:21.767 --> 20:24.531
Joint's like
to burn to cinders.

20:24.570 --> 20:26.800
Well, then why
ain't it yet?

20:26.839 --> 20:28.773
Dumb luck, Tom.

20:28.807 --> 20:30.832
Which you hadn't
ought to push,

20:30.876 --> 20:35.438
camp being situated
like it is,

20:35.481 --> 20:37.915
everyone ass to elbow.

20:37.950 --> 20:39.884
A hazard to one
is a hazard to all.

20:39.919 --> 20:41.682
Why, ain't you
starting to talk

20:41.720 --> 20:43.915
like a goddamn
government official?

20:43.956 --> 20:45.890
I'm Charlie Utter

20:45.925 --> 20:50.021
that attended the same
fucking meeting you did.

20:50.062 --> 20:53.122
And being they pinned
fire marshal on me,

20:53.165 --> 20:55.497
I ain't seeing the camp
burned to the ground.

20:56.502 --> 21:00.404
So either cure
your stovepipe violation

21:00.439 --> 21:03.272
or prepare to get
levied a fine.

21:03.309 --> 21:06.073
Well, I'll lick
a bear's ass

21:06.111 --> 21:08.671
before I'd pay a fine
to E.B. Farnum.

21:08.714 --> 21:11.683
Then separate
your goddamn stovepipes

21:11.717 --> 21:13.150
from the goddamn wall!

21:13.185 --> 21:16.586
Well, I'll send one of my boys
over to pick up the iron.

21:18.457 --> 21:21.585
This ain't the goddamn
day of judgment, Tom.

21:22.828 --> 21:25.991
Jesus Christ Almighty!

21:26.031 --> 21:29.558
That's the kind of shit
that ran me out of Wilkes-Barre.

21:29.602 --> 21:31.900
Where are the camp's
headed, Tom?

21:31.937 --> 21:34.872
Maybe I'll just
fucking move along.

21:34.907 --> 21:36.841
Why is there no sheriff
in this camp?

21:36.875 --> 21:38.536
What?

21:38.577 --> 21:41.546
All these
official positions,

21:41.580 --> 21:43.480
why is there
no sheriff?

21:43.515 --> 21:46.712
Because Al Swearengen
don't want one.

21:46.752 --> 21:48.447
Well, what if
a sheriff took office

21:48.487 --> 21:51.115
that Al could trust
not to bother him?

21:51.156 --> 21:54.922
And you could lay head to pillow nights
knowing he was your friend.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.588
Type of man who'd go up
to a fire marshal, say,

21:57.630 --> 22:00.758
and tell him any so-called
sheet iron violation

22:00.799 --> 22:05.133
that hadn't proven to be
dangerous for, what-

22:05.170 --> 22:09.038
going on two months now-
should be waived:

22:09.074 --> 22:12.339
And whose ear'd be
first to the ground

22:12.378 --> 22:16.246
when any violence created
maybe business opportunities:

22:17.516 --> 22:19.541
And who'd remember
who got him situated.

22:19.585 --> 22:22.019
I never thought of you
as the type to be sheriff.

22:22.054 --> 22:24.386
Nah, I'd be
out of the mold,

22:24.423 --> 22:27.324
but fit for the camp.

22:29.962 --> 22:32.294
My problem, Tom,
is, uh...

22:32.331 --> 22:34.856
whereas he has
a soft spot for you

22:34.900 --> 22:37.391
as a fellow pioneer,

22:37.436 --> 22:40.200
Swearengen hates
my fucking guts.

22:40.239 --> 22:43.640
So knowing how gratefuI
I'd be and alls I'd...

22:43.676 --> 22:46.804
show it to you,
wonder if you'd put in a word?

22:53.819 --> 22:55.650
Yeah?

22:58.490 --> 23:00.390
Mr. Tolliver?

23:00.426 --> 23:02.291
Leon.

23:02.327 --> 23:03.760
Come on in.

23:09.301 --> 23:11.565
Your habit get the best
of you awhile, son?

23:12.671 --> 23:14.070
It got the fucking
upper hand.

23:14.106 --> 23:15.937
How's your sight, Leon?

23:15.974 --> 23:18.966
Oh, the left eye's perfect,
and the right's coming back.

23:21.747 --> 23:25.012
- Have I still got a job, sir?
- I'd need to hear more from you,

23:25.050 --> 23:27.848
what you been up to, who the fuck with.
That kind of thing.

23:27.886 --> 23:31.287
Aw, you probably know everything
about everything already.

23:31.323 --> 23:32.984
Be that as it may...

23:37.763 --> 23:39.162
Ahem, well...

23:40.733 --> 23:43.258
me and Jimmy Irons,
we stole the Chinaman's dope.

23:43.302 --> 23:45.930
Chinaman's courier,
he lost his life.

23:45.971 --> 23:47.939
We slammed dope
for a series of days,

23:47.973 --> 23:51.602
and Al Swearengen's
tough captured us.

23:51.643 --> 23:54.669
And in the bathhouse,
we drew straws and...

23:54.713 --> 23:57.443
Jimmy Irons drowned.

23:57.483 --> 24:00.145
Does that about
cover it?

24:00.185 --> 24:01.618
If you ask me
specifics,

24:01.653 --> 24:04.315
I may be able to come up
with some more details.

24:06.024 --> 24:09.926
- Was Al Swearengen holding the straws?
- Yes, sir.

24:09.962 --> 24:12.192
He said to tell you
what I seen.

24:13.298 --> 24:16.165
And now is he holding
the strings on you?

24:17.870 --> 24:20.668
- Sir?
- Are you here on his instruction?

24:20.706 --> 24:24.073
I'm telling you what I seen
because you asked me to.

24:24.109 --> 24:26.373
What'd they do
with Jimmy Irons?

24:26.411 --> 24:29.107
They give him
to the Chinaman?

24:29.148 --> 24:32.083
I guess they did.
They wrapped him up and took him out.

24:32.117 --> 24:33.880
Swearengen
turned me loose,

24:33.919 --> 24:35.614
but he'd just
give me this,

24:35.654 --> 24:37.781
so I stayed in the tub
untlll I got my bearings.

24:37.823 --> 24:40.519
That's a hell of a way
to treat a white man, ain't it, Leon?

24:40.559 --> 24:42.527
Being fair,
I'd have to say,

24:42.561 --> 24:45.359
I gave Mr. Swearengen
provocation.

24:45.397 --> 24:48.332
He traffics in dope,
so I-

24:48.367 --> 24:51.996
I guess you could say that I'd stole his
property and fucked his action up.

24:53.272 --> 24:55.263
I'm talking about
Jimmy Irons

24:55.307 --> 24:57.741
in connection with getting
delivered to a Chink,

24:57.776 --> 25:00.006
- regardless of his transgression.
- Oh, I see.

25:00.045 --> 25:01.876
And in that connection,
I'm saying

25:01.914 --> 25:03.711
it's a hell of a way
to treat a white man.

25:03.749 --> 25:05.046
I see.

25:05.083 --> 25:08.052
- Do you agree with me?
- Yes.

25:08.086 --> 25:12.045
- So it's your own opinion, too?
- Yes, sir.

25:12.090 --> 25:15.150
Well, that's your new
fucking job,

25:15.194 --> 25:17.992
expressing your own
fucking opinion.

25:18.030 --> 25:20.624
I can do that.

25:20.666 --> 25:23.191
With conviction, Leon.

25:23.235 --> 25:26.068
Your job is to voice your opinion
with some "oomph"

25:26.104 --> 25:28.698
and some character
behind it...

25:28.740 --> 25:31.504
or you'll wish you'd have
got drowned in that bathhouse.

25:32.544 --> 25:34.068
All right.

25:37.816 --> 25:39.545
Welcome back, son.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.154
Oh...
no thanks, Al.

25:44.189 --> 25:46.885
I- or...
yes, I will.

26:06.278 --> 26:07.609
What's going on, Tom?

26:07.646 --> 26:11.742
I- I- I thought you could
make Con Stapleton...

26:11.783 --> 26:13.648
sheriff,

26:13.685 --> 26:16.119
being it's
inevitable anyway.

26:16.154 --> 26:18.418
How the fuck did that
get to be inevitable?

26:18.457 --> 26:21.358
I wouldn't appoint that cocksucker
to empty my spittoons.

26:21.393 --> 26:23.884
What I'm saying is somebody's
gotta be sheriff, Al.

26:23.929 --> 26:26.625
Stapleton's got
points in his favor.

26:26.665 --> 26:29.930
I hope one's not getting to recover
the bribe he paid you

26:29.968 --> 26:31.959
when I don't give him
the fucking job.

26:32.004 --> 26:35.098
- Who's your candidate, Al?
- Nobody.

26:35.140 --> 26:37.768
Well, that's just
postponing the inevitable.

26:37.809 --> 26:41.210
Tom, nothing Stapleton's
got on you

26:41.246 --> 26:43.214
can't be solved
by Dan Dority.

26:43.248 --> 26:47.378
Well...
fill me up.

26:47.419 --> 26:49.944
Jesus Christ.

26:52.391 --> 26:54.689
The- the truth is
I- I feeI like the-

26:54.726 --> 26:57.251
the camp's getting
away from me, Al.

26:57.296 --> 26:59.423
I got a fire commissioner

26:59.464 --> 27:01.364
who's about
to condemn my building,

27:01.400 --> 27:03.061
and we're still
on Indian land.

27:03.101 --> 27:06.537
How does Stapleton
becoming sheriff

27:06.571 --> 27:08.562
keep the camp
from getting away from you?

27:08.607 --> 27:11.633
Well, I know him.
Uh, he'd know I put in a word with you.

27:11.677 --> 27:13.668
What the fuck good
is that to you, Tom,

27:13.712 --> 27:15.373
when that cocksucker
can be bought

27:15.414 --> 27:17.541
for two pieces
of day old bread?

27:17.582 --> 27:19.573
Well, that's right.

27:19.618 --> 27:21.552
That- that
all makes sense.

27:21.586 --> 27:23.679
It, uh...

27:23.722 --> 27:27.089
eh, when you first
come to this camp

27:27.125 --> 27:31.926
and hung your sign up
for nickeI booze and 50¢ pussy-

27:31.964 --> 27:35.092
Them was get-acquainted prices.

27:35.133 --> 27:37.829
But the point is,
I seen your fucking tent.

27:37.869 --> 27:41.236
I walked over and I-
I said "Hello!"

27:41.273 --> 27:44.037
I didn't tell you-
you gotta sheet iron

27:44.076 --> 27:45.634
your fucking stovepipe.

27:45.677 --> 27:47.338
I didn't have
a stovepipe,

27:47.379 --> 27:49.006
and you had your
knife at the ready

27:49.047 --> 27:50.776
if I didn't make
a good impression.

27:50.816 --> 27:52.613
That's true enough,
but you didn't.

27:52.651 --> 27:55.313
And Dority made
a hell of a one on you.

27:55.354 --> 27:58.118
That too,
is- is true enough.

28:01.326 --> 28:03.624
Now, I just, uh...

28:03.662 --> 28:05.493
I feeI like
I know the guy, Al.

28:05.530 --> 28:07.623
Stapleton.

28:09.368 --> 28:12.269
Well...
I don't feeI

28:12.304 --> 28:15.569
like I know anybody
no more.

28:16.641 --> 28:18.871
He can be sheriff
for all I care.

28:20.746 --> 28:22.236
Thank you, Al.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.544
Don't count on him
to be loyal, Tom.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.983
No, no... just...

28:27.019 --> 28:29.681
a familiar face.

28:29.721 --> 28:32.713
And no fucking
paperwork.

28:34.026 --> 28:36.119
Well, I don't even
know if he can write.

28:43.335 --> 28:46.395
- Could he be sworn in here, Al?
- For Christ's sake, Tom!

28:46.438 --> 28:49.601
- He feels you don't like him.
- He's fucking right as rain.

28:49.641 --> 28:51.802
But it'd be
a comfort to him, see,

28:51.843 --> 28:53.936
if he was sworn in
under your roof.

28:57.382 --> 29:00.840
Let Farnum swear him
the fuck in here then.

29:00.886 --> 29:02.911
But press your
luck no further.

29:02.954 --> 29:04.717
Do not expect me
to fucking attend.

29:04.756 --> 29:06.485
AwfuI gratefuI, Al.

29:12.898 --> 29:15.128
- Mr. Star.
- Miss Trixie, pleased to see you.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.759
I threatened
to pay a visit.

29:16.802 --> 29:19.566
You spoke of looking out for some
building implements.

29:19.604 --> 29:22.732
I spoke of looking out
for an ax and a saw,

29:22.774 --> 29:25.971
and if I got 'em, they wouldn't be
applied to building nothing.

29:28.880 --> 29:33.180
Anyways... would you want
a free fuck?

29:35.253 --> 29:38.711
- Why would you say that?
- To know the answer.

29:38.757 --> 29:40.588
Why would you
say it that way?

29:40.625 --> 29:43.389
For Christ's sakes.
Mr. Star,

29:43.428 --> 29:45.487
my cherry is
obstructing my work.

29:45.530 --> 29:47.521
Sir...

29:47.566 --> 29:51.263
would you take it
from me, free?

30:57.235 --> 30:59.999
Seth,
you remember Trixie.

31:00.038 --> 31:02.029
Oh, yes.

31:03.141 --> 31:05.200
Well, I just stopped
for a moment.

31:10.515 --> 31:12.005
Oh, yes.

31:15.220 --> 31:17.188
- I'll lock up.
- Oh, yes.

31:40.378 --> 31:43.313
Kiss my neck or tits
if you have to kiss something.

31:44.683 --> 31:46.548
Let me kiss you.

31:48.153 --> 31:49.984
Well, you're
a goddamn Jew fooI.

32:07.405 --> 32:09.965
Do you swear
before this witness

32:10.008 --> 32:13.967
to uphold whatever laws may
be put in force subsequently?

32:14.012 --> 32:15.445
Yeah, if I can,
yeah.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.608
- And don't forget who your friends are.
- Always.

32:18.650 --> 32:21.881
Gentlemen, hold still.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.411
Take a breath.
Don't move.

32:24.456 --> 32:26.754
One, two, three.

32:28.159 --> 32:29.717
Very good.

32:29.761 --> 32:32.594
Uh, gentlemen,
Tom, I-

32:32.631 --> 32:34.929
I wondered if a second one
might be appropriate

32:34.966 --> 32:37.958
without that putrid apron
around your midsection.

32:39.104 --> 32:41.800
No. Let's drink.

32:49.547 --> 32:51.139
Our health
commissioner.

32:53.118 --> 32:54.745
Whiskey.

32:57.522 --> 33:01.982
You've just missed my swearing in
of the camp's new sheriff.

33:02.027 --> 33:04.860
Con Stapleton, sir.
I'm not sure if we've actually met.

33:04.896 --> 33:07.387
You were at the table
when Hickok was killed.

33:09.434 --> 33:13.029
Indeed, I was.
A horrified bystander.

33:13.071 --> 33:14.698
We weren't
to have a sheriff.

33:14.739 --> 33:17.936
Well, that's been reconsidered
as inevitable.

33:17.976 --> 33:19.876
Had you designs
on the post, Bullock?

33:19.911 --> 33:22.379
- I don't want the post.
- No hard feelings then.

33:22.414 --> 33:24.575
Consider me
at your service.

33:24.616 --> 33:26.880
My wife and child
are to join me from Michigan.

33:29.020 --> 33:31.511
- Is Al in his office?
- Seems to be sequestered.

33:31.556 --> 33:33.888
He missed
the swearing in too.

33:36.861 --> 33:38.920
He did want us
over here, though.

33:38.963 --> 33:40.624
Ain't that
absolutely correct?

33:40.665 --> 33:42.530
Then why the fuck
didn't he come down?

33:44.035 --> 33:46.663
Why didn't he come down?
That's unclear.

33:46.705 --> 33:49.572
To let you know exactly,
I would guess,

33:49.607 --> 33:53.008
at whose mysterious
pleasure you serve.

33:57.949 --> 34:00.543
A candid moment.

34:01.886 --> 34:03.717
Circumcision...

34:03.755 --> 34:06.053
is indeed profiteth
if thou keepest the law,

34:06.091 --> 34:08.217
but if, uh...

34:08.259 --> 34:10.386
if thou art
a transgressor of the law,

34:10.428 --> 34:14.125
thy circumcision
becomes uncircumcision.

34:15.632 --> 34:17.396
Therefore, if...

34:17.435 --> 34:20.460
thy... uncircumcision...

34:22.273 --> 34:25.400
keeps the, uh...
the righteousness of the law,

34:25.443 --> 34:28.536
shall not
his uncircumcision

34:28.580 --> 34:31.014
be count
for circumcision?

34:31.049 --> 34:33.380
Yea, the uncircumcision

34:33.418 --> 34:36.581
that is by nature fulfilling his law
shall judge thee,

34:36.621 --> 34:39.487
who by-
by letter and uh...

34:40.558 --> 34:43.618
circumcision
transgresses the law.

34:45.295 --> 34:46.592
Yeah.

34:57.041 --> 34:59.202
Why'd you let
Stapleton have a badge?

34:59.244 --> 35:00.871
They sworn
the cocksucker in yet?

35:00.912 --> 35:02.140
Hurry down
and toast him.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.273
Maybe Merrick'll
put his camera back up.

35:04.315 --> 35:07.807
No, I prefer to watch
the fucking Reverend Smith

35:07.852 --> 35:10.343
preach to the oxen
and horses.

35:10.388 --> 35:11.980
It ain't right
for the camp.

35:12.023 --> 35:13.820
My wife and child
are coming.

35:13.858 --> 35:16.793
Bullock, it's a ceremonial position
to give comfort

35:16.828 --> 35:20.730
to Tom Nuttall who feels the camp's
leaving him behind.

35:20.765 --> 35:23.393
Putting a badge
on Stapleton makes him feeI

35:23.435 --> 35:25.335
he's got friends
in high places.

35:25.370 --> 35:27.429
That job shouldn't
go to a shitheeI.

35:27.472 --> 35:30.930
As my feeling would be, it should go to
a shitheeI 'cause it's shitheeI's work.

35:30.975 --> 35:32.636
- Doesn't have to be.
- No?

35:32.677 --> 35:34.611
Mr. Bullock,
would you sit down a second?

35:34.646 --> 35:38.138
I want to tell you something about
the law. Please, please, take a seat.

35:40.118 --> 35:43.713
Separate from all them
bribes we put up,

35:43.755 --> 35:48.385
I paid $5,000 to avoid
being the object

35:48.426 --> 35:51.725
of fireside ditties about a man
that fled a murder warrant

35:51.763 --> 35:55.392
then worked very hard to get his camp
annexed by the territory,

35:55.433 --> 35:57.526
only to have them serve
the warrant of him

35:57.569 --> 35:59.298
and to face
the six-foot drop.

35:59.337 --> 36:02.135
Into the cocksucking
magistrate's pocket

36:02.173 --> 36:05.472
the money goes, after which
he sends a message.

36:05.510 --> 36:10.447
The 5,000 will need company
if I'm to be off the hook.

36:10.482 --> 36:12.507
I give you the law.

36:12.550 --> 36:14.984
It doesn't have
to be like that.

36:15.019 --> 36:18.284
Now, if you were
fucking sheriff

36:18.323 --> 36:21.588
and you said,
"Do this, do that,"

36:21.626 --> 36:24.220
I'd consider it, 'cause you're not
a fucking whore.

36:24.262 --> 36:26.526
I have personal
responsibilities.

36:26.564 --> 36:29.863
I'd go downstairs for that swearing in,
and I'd follow your career,

36:29.901 --> 36:33.496
'cause you're one of those pains in the
balls who thinks the law can be honest.

36:35.073 --> 36:36.563
I don't want it.

36:37.876 --> 36:40.174
Hell, I do lots of things
I don't want to do.

36:41.479 --> 36:43.242
You think
you're the only one?

36:43.281 --> 36:46.580
You should have been here when
Tom Nuttall was pissing in my ear.

36:46.618 --> 36:49.746
I think you'd be
all right as sheriff.

36:49.787 --> 36:52.779
Listen, I'm only
talking to you

36:52.824 --> 36:54.951
'cause my partner's
fucking that whore.

36:58.796 --> 37:01.128
Anyway-

37:19.083 --> 37:20.983
He's back open.

37:23.988 --> 37:28.322
- How was your talk with Al?
- Congratulations.

37:30.562 --> 37:32.860
Good sportsmanship,
Bullock.

37:35.466 --> 37:38.867
Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ?

37:38.903 --> 37:42.236
Shall- shall affliction
or distress or-

37:42.273 --> 37:44.571
or persecution or-

37:44.609 --> 37:47.442
or hunger or nakedness?

37:47.478 --> 37:50.777
Or perlll or sword?

37:52.684 --> 37:56.814
Yea, in all these things,
we more than conquer

37:56.854 --> 37:59.345
through him that
hath loved us.

37:59.390 --> 38:02.826
I am persuaded that...

38:03.861 --> 38:06.557
that neither life
nor death,

38:06.598 --> 38:09.533
nor- nor angels,

38:11.002 --> 38:15.496
nor- nor-
nor principalities,

38:15.540 --> 38:19.704
nor powers, nor things present
or things to come,

38:19.744 --> 38:22.406
nor heights, nor depths,

38:22.447 --> 38:25.780
nor any other creature...

38:25.817 --> 38:28.809
from the love of-
of God!

38:30.888 --> 38:32.378
And-

38:33.391 --> 38:35.723
and Jesus Christ
our Lord.

38:59.584 --> 39:01.347
- Seth.
- SoI.

39:01.386 --> 39:04.355
She wasn't here
in a professional capacity.

39:04.389 --> 39:06.380
We have an agreement
with Swearengen

39:06.424 --> 39:08.585
as to the use we put
this establishment to.

39:08.626 --> 39:10.992
She come looking for goods
and things took a turn.

39:11.029 --> 39:14.795
- That can happen.
- Not twice though, at this location.

39:14.832 --> 39:17.767
Yeah.
Maybe I'm not the only one

39:17.802 --> 39:19.997
who should be about
looking for a place.

39:23.207 --> 39:26.142
Gonna make an offer on that piece
on the western slope.

39:26.177 --> 39:28.168
Did you have
another look?

39:28.212 --> 39:31.181
Go ahead and get to building
if Hostetler takes the offer.

39:31.215 --> 39:34.378
Maybe have a leg up when Martha
and your boy arrive.

39:34.419 --> 39:36.910
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

39:36.954 --> 39:40.481
I am Otis Russell.
Uh, would you be Mr. Bullock?

39:40.525 --> 39:44.086
- I'm SoI Star.
- Oh, how do you do, Mr. Star?

39:44.128 --> 39:46.289
- Very well.
- I'm Seth Bullock.

39:47.565 --> 39:48.930
Mr. Bullock.

39:51.069 --> 39:52.900
I am Alma Garret's father.

39:52.937 --> 39:55.633
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

39:56.774 --> 39:58.708
I am very gratefuI
for the kindness

39:58.743 --> 40:00.335
that you've shown
my daughter.

40:00.378 --> 40:03.472
I wonder if you would
join us for dinner tonight.

40:03.514 --> 40:07.348
- I'd be happy to.
- Oh, Mr. Star, will you join us?

40:07.385 --> 40:10.377
- Thanks, but I can't.
- Regrettable.

40:10.421 --> 40:13.151
Would 6:00 at the hoteI
be convenient?

40:13.191 --> 40:15.591
My daughter says
that the dinner hour is early.

40:15.626 --> 40:16.991
6:00 is fine.

40:19.297 --> 40:22.061
Just months that this camp
came together, huh?

40:22.100 --> 40:25.934
- Yes, sir.
- Remarkable.

40:36.881 --> 40:38.508
Hi, Doc.

40:40.451 --> 40:42.214
First thing to say,

40:42.253 --> 40:46.280
I regret the tone
I had with you earlier.

40:46.324 --> 40:47.848
Okay.

40:47.892 --> 40:51.794
If we hold with the Greeks
that we're made of humors,

40:51.829 --> 40:55.390
I guess my bile
was in its ascendant.

40:55.433 --> 40:58.368
- Okay.
- Sit down.

41:00.671 --> 41:02.639
Another thing...

41:02.673 --> 41:04.197
that the Greeks say-

41:04.242 --> 41:06.904
except that
I learned this in Latin-

41:08.312 --> 41:12.908
is "Primum non nocere. "

41:12.950 --> 41:16.477
And that means,
"First, do no harm. "

41:16.521 --> 41:20.321
And this has been
a great concern to me in your case.

41:20.358 --> 41:22.758
To interfere,

41:22.794 --> 41:26.025
even with the best
of intentions,

41:26.063 --> 41:28.896
and have you misjudge
your capacities

41:28.933 --> 41:32.300
'cause you rely on some
mechanical contraption

41:32.336 --> 41:34.031
and wind up
hurting yourself,

41:34.071 --> 41:36.039
would be a poor use,

41:36.073 --> 41:39.406
indeed, of my very
limited skills.

41:39.443 --> 41:41.707
You can get
around now, JeweI.

41:41.746 --> 41:46.877
I can only imagine with what difficulty
and exertion and pain,

41:46.918 --> 41:50.581
but the moving around
you can do is precious to you.

41:50.621 --> 41:54.990
I do not want
to fuck you up.

41:55.026 --> 41:57.494
No, we wouldn't
want that.

41:57.528 --> 41:59.428
Having said that...

42:00.431 --> 42:02.797
and different from the...

42:04.202 --> 42:06.500
harness-type attachments

42:06.537 --> 42:09.631
in that Civlll War book,

42:09.674 --> 42:12.666
I thought we might try
something like this.

42:16.013 --> 42:18.038
Let's.

42:19.817 --> 42:22.342
How was your visit,
Trixie?

42:22.386 --> 42:24.377
How was the child?

42:24.422 --> 42:27.721
- Had a good visit.
- Is the child conversant?

42:27.758 --> 42:31.285
Moving along
from saying her name?

42:31.329 --> 42:32.990
Anyways, I better
take my turn.

42:33.030 --> 42:35.191
No, you look good
having gone out.

42:35.233 --> 42:38.999
You're more relieved,
more relaxed.

42:39.036 --> 42:40.901
We can't work
all the time, can we?

42:40.938 --> 42:43.736
We all need some
type of relaxation,

42:43.774 --> 42:46.868
companionship
or the like?

42:46.911 --> 42:49.471
- Yes.
- You get away from me now.

42:49.513 --> 42:52.107
Hey, Doc, how long were you
planning on taking

42:52.149 --> 42:54.845
before you told me
what the fuck was wrong with JeweI?

42:54.886 --> 42:57.514
Nothing, nothing
she wasn't born with.

42:57.555 --> 42:59.750
Mmm, I mean, she told me
she was knocked up,

42:59.790 --> 43:02.350
but I assumed that was
her gimp sense of humor.

43:02.393 --> 43:04.190
She wants me
to brace her leg

43:04.228 --> 43:06.594
so her dragging it
doesn't drive you crazy.

43:06.631 --> 43:09.225
- So what'd you tell her?
- Not to worry about your moods,

43:09.267 --> 43:11.064
that you generate
those yourself

43:11.102 --> 43:13.263
and then you
find your excuse for having 'em.

43:13.304 --> 43:16.068
Saucy words, Doc.
Good thing you're handy with the snatch.

43:18.476 --> 43:22.310
I had an idea for a boot,
just now measured her for it.

43:22.346 --> 43:25.372
If you treat her as successfully
as you did the minister,

43:25.416 --> 43:27.976
she'll be kicking up
her heels in no fucking time.

43:30.488 --> 43:33.924
I will leave you now
to pursue another excuse.

43:38.930 --> 43:41.160
Get that Jew
over here.

43:43.768 --> 43:45.963
My daughter tells me
that before his murder,

43:46.003 --> 43:48.631
Wild Bill Hickok asked you
to look to her interests.

43:48.673 --> 43:50.641
Yes, sir.

43:50.675 --> 43:54.008
Had you ridden
with Hickok on the plains?

43:54.045 --> 43:56.707
I met him in the camp.
I only knew him a few days.

43:56.747 --> 43:58.977
And impressed him at once
as being trustworthy.

43:59.016 --> 44:01.985
They rescued a child
in the wilderness

44:02.019 --> 44:05.477
and brought to justice one
of the men who murdered her family.

44:05.523 --> 44:09.254
And, um, how was
justice meted out?

44:09.293 --> 44:10.851
We shot him.

44:18.069 --> 44:20.867
Slab of beef
off the chuck,

44:20.905 --> 44:24.363
boiled whole carrots
and little brown potatoes.

44:24.408 --> 44:27.741
Fresh baked bread
and rhubarb pie to come.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.415
- Your repast awaits your mouths.
- Thank you.

44:38.189 --> 44:40.419
Postprandial cigars
for the menfolk.

44:40.458 --> 44:42.426
Oh no, we have
our own smokes.

44:42.460 --> 44:44.928
I hope you brought
ravenous appetites.

44:44.962 --> 44:46.862
Thank you,
Mr. Farnum.

44:50.034 --> 44:51.899
He had something
to do with it.

44:54.071 --> 44:55.800
Would you prefer,
Mr. Bullock,

44:55.840 --> 44:57.899
that Alma stay
in the camp?

44:57.942 --> 45:00.410
In any case,
I've decided to stay.

45:00.444 --> 45:02.708
As her advisor,
I mean?

45:03.814 --> 45:05.475
It's Mrs. Garret's affair.

45:05.516 --> 45:06.949
If she wanted
to go back East,

45:06.984 --> 45:08.679
her interest here
could be seen to.

45:08.719 --> 45:09.981
But I don't.

45:10.021 --> 45:12.046
Well, and it would
show her in a better light

45:12.089 --> 45:13.716
should title
be contested.

45:13.758 --> 45:16.386
The custom is if you give a claim
your efforts and staked it

45:16.427 --> 45:19.225
or bought it fair, someone would
have to go some to take it away.

45:19.263 --> 45:21.424
We've taken steps
to demonstrate her activity.

45:21.465 --> 45:23.990
Of course, if the New York
courts had jurisdiction,

45:24.035 --> 45:26.265
they'd sell the holdings
to the highest bidder.

45:26.303 --> 45:29.272
Not many here would give a damn
what a New York court held or didn't.

45:29.306 --> 45:32.173
- Excuse my language.
- On the contrary, Mr. Bullock,

45:32.209 --> 45:34.370
thank you for acknowledging
my presence.

45:34.412 --> 45:38.212
I thought, Button, that you were
our entire preoccupation.

45:39.617 --> 45:42.586
The man's a charlatan,
Richardson.

45:42.620 --> 45:46.147
A cheat, a broad tosser
and a clip.

45:48.125 --> 45:49.888
I only wonder...

45:49.927 --> 45:52.521
if the daughter's
been in it with him,

45:52.563 --> 45:55.930
or she's his pigeon.

45:57.668 --> 46:01.104
- May I look, Mr. Farnum?
- Yes.

46:01.138 --> 46:04.130
When you've grown
a full head of hair.

46:05.609 --> 46:07.668
Brass, that would be...

46:09.013 --> 46:11.481
to gull your own
flesh and blood.

46:25.429 --> 46:28.921
- Mr. Swearengen.
- You owe me $5.

46:31.435 --> 46:33.596
If you ass-fucked her,
you owe me seven.

46:35.372 --> 46:37.306
- No.
- You didn't ass-fuck her?

46:37.341 --> 46:39.605
I'm not paying you.

46:39.643 --> 46:42.305
It wasn't to do with you,
it wasn't business.

46:42.346 --> 46:44.007
Trixie!

46:44.048 --> 46:46.107
Don't think
I don't understand.

46:48.119 --> 46:49.848
I mean, what can
any one of us

46:49.887 --> 46:52.048
ever really fucking
hope for, huh?

46:52.089 --> 46:56.423
Except for a moment
here and there with a person

46:56.460 --> 46:58.553
who doesn't want to rob,
steal or murder us?

46:58.596 --> 47:00.723
At night,
it may happen.

47:00.764 --> 47:03.289
Sun-up, one person
against the fucking wall,

47:03.334 --> 47:05.598
the other may hop
on the fucking bed,

47:05.636 --> 47:08.469
trusted each other enough to tell
half the fucking truth.

47:09.540 --> 47:11.269
Everybody needs that.

47:12.610 --> 47:14.373
It becomes
precious to 'em.

47:15.813 --> 47:17.974
They don't want
to see it fucked with.

47:18.015 --> 47:21.314
- I won't pay.
- You pay...

47:21.352 --> 47:23.081
or she pays.

47:32.129 --> 47:35.895
No home visits.
Do your visiting on the premises.

47:35.933 --> 47:38.902
Five.
Seven for an ass-fuck.

47:42.106 --> 47:43.403
You get back to work.

47:45.743 --> 47:47.643
You sleep tonight
amongst your own.

47:49.847 --> 47:51.371
Another fucking bottle.

47:53.584 --> 47:56.348
If we'd had
a kitchen, Sophia,

47:56.387 --> 47:59.015
after supper,
we'd have retired to it,

47:59.056 --> 48:02.856
to chores and gossip

48:02.893 --> 48:06.420
on the most minute
domestic matters,

48:06.463 --> 48:09.523
while the men
walked and smoked

48:09.567 --> 48:11.899
and argued
more important matters...

48:13.871 --> 48:16.169
and, incidentally,
decided our fates.

48:16.207 --> 48:20.405
Understandable, her late husband
was so taken with my daughter.

48:20.444 --> 48:22.002
I didn't know him
very well,

48:22.046 --> 48:24.913
but I certainly recognized
his doting infatuation.

48:24.949 --> 48:26.814
I didn't know
him at all.

48:28.185 --> 48:30.779
I'll admit that I had
hoped she might find a man

48:30.821 --> 48:33.051
who would dote
on her and more,

48:33.090 --> 48:36.253
perhaps had a surer sense
of what the world was.

48:36.293 --> 48:38.284
And, apparently,

48:38.329 --> 48:40.763
I'm entitled
to hope that again.

48:40.798 --> 48:43.289
My wife and son
will be joining me soon.

48:45.903 --> 48:48.736
I'm long past judgment,
Mr. Bullock,

48:48.772 --> 48:51.172
and I've learned that
no matter what people say

48:51.208 --> 48:53.108
or how civlll they seem,

48:53.143 --> 48:55.168
their passions rule.

48:57.047 --> 48:59.447
I see no reason why
your wife and son's arrival

48:59.483 --> 49:02.179
need alter my hopes
for my daughter's happiness

49:02.219 --> 49:04.915
or security or the security
of her holdings.

49:07.725 --> 49:09.659
I'll say good night,
Mr. Russell,

49:09.693 --> 49:10.955
with thanks for dinner.

49:10.995 --> 49:12.724
That will
disappoint Alma.

49:12.763 --> 49:15.493
I'm sure she didn't think
she was saying good night

49:15.532 --> 49:18.262
- when we left for our walk.
- She'll be all right.

49:18.302 --> 49:19.735
If I have offended you,

49:19.770 --> 49:22.000
I've accomplished the opposite
of my intention,

49:22.039 --> 49:24.269
which would not be
an unprecedented result.

49:24.308 --> 49:26.367
- I just want to say good night.
- Of course.

49:26.410 --> 49:28.537
- Good night, Mr. Bullock.
- Good night then.

49:28.579 --> 49:30.479
Trust me
to explain to Alma.

49:30.514 --> 49:33.449
I'm a practiced
and inveterate liar.

49:36.320 --> 49:40.723
If we didn't hate them too much
to be curious about the world...

49:42.059 --> 49:45.324
we'd wonder what
they'd had to say.

49:46.330 --> 49:49.356
Craps! Loser!
Line away.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.425
You better not need
them fingers, Hoss,

49:51.468 --> 49:53.800
if you spill that drink
on my goddamn felt too.

49:53.837 --> 49:56.829
Hand that stick to a captain
of the floating table, Cy.

49:58.509 --> 50:01.569
- Eddie Sawyer.
- Back in action if you'll have me.

50:01.612 --> 50:03.546
Well, all right.

50:03.580 --> 50:05.980
You need to take it back
about that boy, Cy,

50:06.016 --> 50:08.007
me being interested
that way.

50:08.052 --> 50:10.043
Aw, hell, Eddie,
you know me.

50:10.087 --> 50:13.648
I get in a brown study, I say any
goddamn thing comes to mind.

50:13.691 --> 50:16.660
Withdrawn with apologies.

50:19.363 --> 50:21.388
Coming out.
New shooter.

50:21.432 --> 50:24.765
Are we that far west
that we've wound up in fucking China?

50:26.503 --> 50:29.870
Where a white man
kowtows to a celestial

50:29.907 --> 50:32.068
like that arrogant
cocksucker Wu!

50:32.109 --> 50:33.974
Take it easy, Leon.

50:34.011 --> 50:35.774
It sticks in my craw,
Mr. Tolliver.

50:35.813 --> 50:37.508
Do I have
my weaknesses?

50:37.548 --> 50:39.311
Yes.

50:39.350 --> 50:42.513
But I will not have a fucking Chink
courier rob me blind

50:42.553 --> 50:44.714
and have my friend
Jimmy Irons robbed blind

50:44.755 --> 50:47.622
in the course of feeding off
our fucking weaknesses!

50:47.658 --> 50:50.354
Or have that courier's
fucking Chink boss

50:50.394 --> 50:52.385
issue an order
to Al Swearengen

50:52.429 --> 50:54.363
that's supposed to be
so fucking tough

50:54.398 --> 50:55.990
to turn one
of us over!

50:56.033 --> 50:58.934
Swearengen kowtows
and turns one of us over

50:58.969 --> 51:01.369
to be eaten by
the fucking Chinese pigs!

51:01.405 --> 51:05.341
This fucking gets to me.
I can't put it out of my fucking mind!

51:05.376 --> 51:07.867
Leon, Leon, Leon.

51:09.079 --> 51:12.480
Thin it out, Leon.
Prune the patter down, hmm?

51:14.918 --> 51:16.909
For the winner,
pay the field.

51:16.954 --> 51:18.945
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hiya, kitten.

51:18.989 --> 51:21.787
- You and Cy reconciled?
- Thick as thieves.

51:21.825 --> 51:23.725
And if I weren't
as good at what I did,

51:23.761 --> 51:25.786
you'd see I just palmed
80 in chips

51:25.829 --> 51:28.229
for the Joanie Stubbs
construction fund.

51:29.433 --> 51:31.799
- Hi, Cy.
- Hi, Joanie.

51:31.835 --> 51:34.395
What were you doing giving
Joanie the office, Eddie?

51:34.438 --> 51:36.201
Saying "Welcome home. "

51:36.240 --> 51:38.367
Are you home, honey?

51:38.409 --> 51:41.640
I gave up waiting for that search party
you didn't send, Cy.

51:41.678 --> 51:46.081
Mind if I show Joanie
my peacock, Eddie?

51:48.085 --> 51:51.020
- Find land for your plot yet?
- I'm still looking.

51:51.054 --> 51:53.852
I see the pest tent's
coming down.

51:53.891 --> 51:56.485
Ah, it's too far off
till the camp expands.

51:56.527 --> 52:00.964
You'd want a more central plot,
say fronting Cochran's alley.

52:00.998 --> 52:03.296
Well, those all seem
took by Chinese.

52:03.333 --> 52:05.995
You never know how
that shit's gonna shake out.

52:09.573 --> 52:11.768
Those Chinese cocksuckers!

52:11.809 --> 52:14.403
A new shooter
coming out!

52:17.281 --> 52:19.306
That man's not here
to help his daughter.

52:19.349 --> 52:21.715
He's looking
to root at her claim.

52:24.288 --> 52:26.017
You went to see
that whore again?

52:26.056 --> 52:28.786
I guess she had to account
for her being outside,

52:28.826 --> 52:31.954
and Swearengen sent for me
to pay him his fee.

52:31.995 --> 52:33.986
I guess she told him
where she'd been.

52:36.767 --> 52:39.668
It might have been me
he found out from, SoI,

52:39.703 --> 52:41.637
'cause I'm sometimes
that stupid.

52:41.672 --> 52:44.140
You think it could
have been you?

52:44.174 --> 52:45.801
I'm sure it was,

52:45.843 --> 52:47.208
speaking without thinking,

52:47.244 --> 52:49.508
justifying being
in his place.

52:49.546 --> 52:51.639
Being you'd been
ousted from your own.

52:51.682 --> 52:53.741
I was hot seeing that
tinhorn Stapleton

52:53.784 --> 52:55.513
getting installed
as sheriff,

52:55.552 --> 52:57.543
and I used poor
fucking judgment.

53:00.791 --> 53:03.692
Sorry Mrs. Garret's pa
turns out a shitheeI.

53:03.727 --> 53:07.629
Cold enough world without getting
gone against by your own.

53:08.899 --> 53:10.958
Now, I see what the fuck's
in front of me,

53:11.001 --> 53:13.026
and I don't pretend
it's something else.

53:13.070 --> 53:18.133
I was fucking her
but now I'm gonna fuck you,

53:18.175 --> 53:19.938
if you don't
piss me off

53:19.977 --> 53:22.969
or open your yap
at the wrong fucking time.

53:23.013 --> 53:26.346
The only time you're
supposed to open your yap

53:26.383 --> 53:28.578
is so I can put
my fucking prick in it.

53:28.619 --> 53:30.951
Otherwise,
you shut the fuck up.

53:30.988 --> 53:33.013
Now, hold
onto that, huh?

53:34.224 --> 53:36.192
The point is,

53:36.226 --> 53:38.217
this minister's
gotta fucking die.

53:38.262 --> 53:41.527
I mean, that's the-
that's the fucking point.

53:41.565 --> 53:43.829
He's gonna die
sooner or later.

53:43.867 --> 53:46.358
I mean, he's making
a fucking jerk of himself,

53:46.403 --> 53:48.997
and, I mean, well,
why-why go on with that?

53:49.039 --> 53:52.202
Who's-who's gonna
benefit from that, huh?

53:52.242 --> 53:56.303
No, you just gotta kill it
and put an end to it.

53:56.346 --> 53:58.041
You don't
linger on about it,

53:58.081 --> 54:00.743
you don't fucking go around
weeping about it,

54:00.784 --> 54:02.012
and you don't,
you know,

54:02.052 --> 54:03.815
behave like a kid
with sore thumb,

54:03.854 --> 54:07.688
loco sucking it.
Now, "Mm, my poor fucking thumb!"

54:07.724 --> 54:11.592
I mean, you- you gotta behave
like a grown fucking man, huh?

54:11.628 --> 54:14.529
You gotta shut
the fuck up,

54:14.565 --> 54:17.193
don't be sorry,
don't look fucking back,

54:17.234 --> 54:19.702
because, believe me,
no one gives a fuck.

54:19.736 --> 54:21.863
- You understand?
- Yeah.

54:21.905 --> 54:25.466
You shut the fuck up, huh?
Gimme that!

54:26.843 --> 54:30.677
Hey, you suck my dick

54:30.714 --> 54:33.274
and shut
the fuck up, huh?

54:33.317 --> 54:35.342
Come here.
Come on.

54:36.420 --> 54:38.945
Now then, here.

54:38.989 --> 54:41.617
The place where
I found you, huh,

54:41.658 --> 54:43.956
is where this
warrant's from.

54:45.562 --> 54:47.427
Could you believe

54:47.464 --> 54:50.058
that I may have stuck
a knife in someone's guts

54:50.100 --> 54:51.727
12 hours before
you got on the wagon

54:51.768 --> 54:53.827
we headed out for
fucking Laramie? No!

54:53.870 --> 54:55.770
Because I don't look
fucking backwards.

54:55.806 --> 54:58.138
I do what I have
to do and go on.

54:58.175 --> 54:59.972
Whoa, whoa,
whoa... what?

55:00.010 --> 55:03.275
You got a stagecoach
to catch or something, huh?

55:03.313 --> 55:06.248
Slow the fuck up.

55:07.718 --> 55:10.619
Did you know the orphanage part
of the building you lived in,

55:10.654 --> 55:13.145
behind it she ran
a whorehouse, huh?

55:15.158 --> 55:17.786
Oh, so you knew?

55:17.828 --> 55:20.854
So, so what are you fucking
looking at then, huh?

55:20.897 --> 55:23.161
God.

55:23.200 --> 55:26.192
Now, I'll tell you
something you don't know.

55:29.272 --> 55:32.764
Before she ran
a girls' orphanage,

55:32.809 --> 55:36.802
fat Mrs. fucking Anderson

55:36.847 --> 55:40.339
ran the boys' orphanage
on fucking Euclid Avenue,

55:40.384 --> 55:44.320
as I would see her fat ass
waddling out the boys' dormitory

55:44.354 --> 55:46.219
at 5:00
in the fucking morning,

55:46.256 --> 55:50.249
every fucking morning after she blew
her stupid fucking cowbell

55:50.293 --> 55:52.022
and woke us
all the fuck up.

55:52.062 --> 55:54.462
And my fucking mother
dropped me the fuck off there

55:54.498 --> 55:56.796
with $7 and 60 some-odd
fucking cents

55:56.833 --> 56:00.701
on her way to sucking cock
in... in Georgia.

56:00.737 --> 56:05.470
And I didn't get to count
the fucking cents

56:05.509 --> 56:08.171
before the fucking
door opened, and there,

56:08.211 --> 56:10.509
Mrs. fat-ass fucking Anderson,

56:10.547 --> 56:13.072
who sold you to me.

56:13.116 --> 56:16.677
I had to give her $7
and 60-odd fucking cents

56:16.720 --> 56:19.450
that my mother shoved
in my fucking hand

56:19.489 --> 56:23.186
before she hammered
one, two, three, four times

56:23.226 --> 56:26.161
on the door and scurried off
down fucking Euclid Avenue,

56:26.196 --> 56:30.257
probably 30 fucking years
before you were fucking born.

56:30.300 --> 56:33.792
Then around Cape Horn
and up to San Francisco,

56:33.837 --> 56:35.737
where she probably
became mayor

56:35.772 --> 56:39.401
or some other type of success story,
unless by some fucking chance

56:39.443 --> 56:42.640
she wound up
as a ditch for fucking cum.

56:42.679 --> 56:47.309
Now fucking
go faster, hmm?

56:53.457 --> 56:56.449
Okay, go ahead and spit it out.
You don't need to swallow.

56:56.493 --> 56:58.222
Just spit it out.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.264
Anyways.

57:31.461 --> 57:36.125
& Snake baked a ho-cake,
and set the frog to watch it &

57:36.166 --> 57:40.660
& The frog fell a-dozing,
the lizard came and took it &

57:40.704 --> 57:45.937
& Bring back my ho-cake,
you long-tailed nanny-o &

57:57.220 --> 58:01.816
& Bring back my ho-cake,
you long-tailed nanny-o &

58:13.336 --> 58:19.138
& Bring back my ho-cake,
you long tailed nanny-o. &
