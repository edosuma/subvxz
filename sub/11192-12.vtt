WEBVTT

00:12.900 --> 00:18.321
Read-outs on P8X-362, sir.
Looks good, especially the mineral scans.

00:18.178 --> 00:22.721
I'll pass this on to SG-4. They'll be geared
up and ready for departure by 1100 hours.

00:22.617 --> 00:24.527
<i>Thank you, Sergeant.</i>

00:24.536 --> 00:28.580
<i>Offworld activation.
Repeat, offworld activation.</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:37.369
- Is there anyone due back?
- No, sir.

00:38.732 --> 00:42.350
<i>Incoming traveller.
Repeat, incoming traveller.</i>

00:45.252 --> 00:47.789
<i>All defence teams, stand by.</i>

00:52.090 --> 00:55.210
<i>- Looks like SG-1, sir.
- Open the iris.</i>

00:56.768 --> 00:59.057
Get a medical team down there.

01:00.008 --> 01:05.215
<i>Medical team, report to Stargate room.
Medical team, report to Stargate room.</i>

01:13.444 --> 01:15.521
Stand down.

01:17.325 --> 01:22.662
SG-1 couldn't have been deployed more
than three hours ago - what happened?

01:23.162 --> 01:25.867
Colonel, look at me. Look at me.

01:26.882 --> 01:29.882
They're in shock.
Get them to the infirmary.

01:33.801 --> 01:36.292
Colonel... where's Dr. Jackson?

01:39.278 --> 01:41.354
Daniel Jackson.

01:41.358 --> 01:43.433
He didn't make it, sir.

01:44.356 --> 01:46.432
Daniel's dead, sir.

02:59.259 --> 03:01.667
I want a complete analysis
of these uniforms.

03:01.658 --> 03:03.948
See if there's any form of contamination.

03:03.937 --> 03:06.013
Yes.

03:06.016 --> 03:08.175
What have we got?

03:09.776 --> 03:11.853
He's gone, isn't he?

03:15.974 --> 03:18.300
Why can't I stop shaking?

03:18.295 --> 03:23.336
You're still in shock, Captain.
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.

03:23.573 --> 03:26.443
Can I get another
warm blanket here, please?

03:27.412 --> 03:30.947
I just want you to take
some slow, deep breaths for me.

03:32.132 --> 03:34.207
That's good.

03:35.810 --> 03:38.300
You wanna tell me how it happened?

03:41.288 --> 03:43.661
He screamed and then...

03:43.649 --> 03:46.933
and there was fire and he...
he called out for help,

03:46.887 --> 03:51.549
and then... he screamed and then
he... he was gone, he was just...

03:51.966 --> 03:54.920
Shh. It's all right.

03:54.885 --> 03:58.384
We're gonna give you
a sedative now so you can rest.

03:58.324 --> 03:59.985
Nurse.

04:00.962 --> 04:02.622
5cc.

04:07.362 --> 04:09.401
I do not wish this done.

04:09.401 --> 04:12.152
They're just tryin' to take
your blood pressure.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.409
It's all right, that can wait for now.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.317
Teal'c, you can go
and change if you want to.

04:24.079 --> 04:28.622
OK. Colonel - any pain, headache?

04:28.516 --> 04:29.975
No.

04:30.716 --> 04:33.586
- Can I get you to look straight ahead?
- Wha...?!

04:33.836 --> 04:35.793
- What is that?
- It's a penlight.

04:35.795 --> 04:38.286
I'm sorry, you must be photosensitive.

04:38.274 --> 04:40.183
You think?

04:41.194 --> 04:46.187
It's all right, Colonel, we can do this
after debriefing or even tomorrow.

04:48.273 --> 04:50.348
- Thank you.
- OK.

05:01.829 --> 05:03.904
Thank you.

05:09.346 --> 05:13.391
We went through the Stargate
at precisely 0700 this morning.

05:14.266 --> 05:17.432
The world we found
appeared to be uninhabited.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.793
There was no immediate sign of danger?

05:19.783 --> 05:22.701
<i>There were these holes, volcanic gas.</i>

05:23.463 --> 05:27.211
<i>I took some soil samples
to test for minerals. Daniel...</i>

05:32.221 --> 05:33.764
Take your time.

05:33.781 --> 05:35.856
<i>He said...</i>

05:38.261 --> 05:40.134
<i>He said "Colonel, help me".</i>

05:43.858 --> 05:46.183
- And then he was gone.
- Gone?

05:46.858 --> 05:48.518
Engulfed.

05:51.697 --> 05:56.442
- In fire, sir.
- There was nothing you could've done.

05:56.336 --> 06:00.380
I swear to God, sir,
I tried to get to him, but the heat was...

06:02.733 --> 06:07.062
- It blasted toward us, and...
- And what did you do then?

06:07.372 --> 06:12.329
There was a body of water somewhere
nearby. It was like a... a lake...

06:12.211 --> 06:14.454
or... a sea, maybe.

06:17.771 --> 06:21.305
We... all submerged ourselves.
That's what saved us.

06:21.490 --> 06:24.656
- And by then?
- By then, Daniel was gone.

06:24.610 --> 06:28.358
There was nothing... nothing left, sir.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.283
I ordered the team to evacuate.

06:34.365 --> 06:38.149
- We'll send a team to recover the body.
- No, sir!

06:38.086 --> 06:40.956
It's... too volatile, sir.

06:40.925 --> 06:43.002
The whole area was...

06:45.802 --> 06:47.879
very unstable.

06:50.082 --> 06:54.127
It's a hard thing to lose
a member of the team, Colonel.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.754
I've gone through it myself.

06:56.761 --> 06:59.168
- If there's anything I...
- Yes, sir.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.795
Dismissed.

07:17.834 --> 07:23.292
General? I've a few more tests to run, but
I've got the results from my initial exams.

07:23.154 --> 07:25.906
- And?
- Except for some minor contusions,

07:25.874 --> 07:29.456
photosensitivity, which I can
blame on exposure to volcanic gases

07:29.393 --> 07:31.966
in the atmosphere, they're fine.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.571
Frankly, I'm more worried about
their post-traumatic symptoms.

07:35.512 --> 07:39.889
When your lives depend on each other,
you form very deep bonds.

07:39.790 --> 07:43.574
Of course, sir. I can't help but
be concerned. Call it intuition...

07:43.509 --> 07:46.511
The best thing we can do
is get them on another mission.

07:46.470 --> 07:50.418
I'll put them back into rotation when
I assign a replacement for Dr. Jackson.

07:50.348 --> 07:55.009
I don't agree. I wanna keep them under
observation for several days at least.

07:54.906 --> 07:58.656
In my experience, it's best for
the surviving members of the team...

07:58.586 --> 08:00.793
Sir, with all due respect,

08:00.785 --> 08:04.119
your experience doesn't include
gate travel to another planet.

08:04.064 --> 08:09.021
Nor does anyone else's experience, for
that matter. Several days at least. I insist.

08:08.903 --> 08:11.939
Very well, I'll put them on
stand-down for seven days.

08:11.903 --> 08:13.978
Thank you, sir.

09:15.366 --> 09:16.611
Colonel.

09:21.005 --> 09:22.962
Daniel Jackson...

09:22.966 --> 09:26.630
made this place... happen.

09:27.644 --> 09:29.932
As a member of SG-1...

09:31.364 --> 09:33.652
he was our voice...

09:34.643 --> 09:36.765
our conscience.

09:38.481 --> 09:40.972
He was a very courageous man.

09:42.519 --> 09:44.596
He was a good man.

09:47.158 --> 09:51.738
For those of us lucky enough to have
known him, he was also a friend.

11:20.177 --> 11:22.585
<i>We commend
Daniel Jackson's spirit</i>

11:22.576 --> 11:25.149
to the universe he opened
up for us...

11:25.775 --> 11:30.105
and pledge to continue our journey
of discovery in his memory.

11:31.413 --> 11:33.490
May he rest in peace.

12:00.647 --> 12:02.307
Jack?

12:04.765 --> 12:06.841
Sam? Teal'c?

12:08.605 --> 12:10.264
Anyone?

12:24.280 --> 12:29.322
So we're sittin' around eating
some kind of gourmet Abydonian cuisine.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.778
Daniel tells Sha're he's gonna show us
this cartouche thing, but before we leave,

12:33.678 --> 12:38.256
she stands up, plants a kiss on him
that makes his face disappear for a day.

12:44.797 --> 12:49.209
- I do not understand this ritual.
- It's called a wake.

12:49.115 --> 12:53.942
On Chulak, when someone dies,
it is custom to not eat for three days.

12:53.834 --> 12:59.076
Well, a wake is like a big party, supposed
to give the departed a jolly sendoff.

12:58.952 --> 13:03.163
Sam, Teal'c. Glad you made it.
Somethin' to drink?

13:03.071 --> 13:05.230
Yeah, sure. Beer.

13:05.791 --> 13:08.495
- Teal'c?
- I must refrain.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.711
There's food upstairs.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.645
Help! Jack!

13:19.866 --> 13:22.072
<i>Help! Help!</i>

13:52.178 --> 13:55.096
Daniel. Daniel Jackson.

13:56.298 --> 13:58.173
You?

14:00.856 --> 14:04.985
My friends, the... the others
who came here with me...

14:24.371 --> 14:27.787
It's a very old Earth writing. It's cuneiform.

14:30.210 --> 14:34.207
It's the first kind of writing
we've ever found on my world.

14:35.928 --> 14:37.553
OK.

14:37.567 --> 14:40.273
It's Akkadian, not Sumerian, so...

14:41.846 --> 14:44.172
It's a tough one. Let me think.

14:44.486 --> 14:45.600
Ah!

14:45.645 --> 14:47.306
"Reveal."

14:48.525 --> 14:50.186
"Fate."

14:51.845 --> 14:55.546
"Om-or-oca. Reveal fate Omoroca."

14:55.484 --> 14:58.235
"Reveal fate Omoroca"?

14:58.202 --> 15:00.491
"Omoroca", what is that?

15:00.482 --> 15:02.558
That's you?

15:03.642 --> 15:05.717
No? Something else?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.486
"Reveal... fate... Omoroca."

15:09.640 --> 15:12.890
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you want me to do.

15:17.879 --> 15:20.500
I don't know what you want me to do.

15:20.476 --> 15:22.635
I don't understand.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.019
Can we get this damn car outta here?!

15:48.150 --> 15:50.642
What's on your mind, Colonel?

15:52.629 --> 15:55.962
- Retirement, actually.
- You don't mean that.

15:57.908 --> 15:59.985
I think I do.

16:00.908 --> 16:06.150
Well, I can't let you do that at the moment.
I've got an assignment for SG-1.

16:06.027 --> 16:10.488
Dr. Jackson's apartment needs to be
closed by Stargate personnel.

16:10.385 --> 16:15.594
National security aside, you're probably
the closest thing he had to a family.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.929
It's not an order, it's a request.

16:23.022 --> 16:25.097
Yes, sir.

16:26.062 --> 16:29.264
Why don't you come
join the others in the back?

16:30.421 --> 16:32.081
Yes, sir.

16:33.740 --> 16:38.650
- You know that's my car, don't you?
- You should get that window fixed.

16:41.378 --> 16:43.453
"If a free man...

16:44.256 --> 16:47.673
accuses another of murder
and fails to prove,

16:47.616 --> 16:50.451
the accuser shall be put to death."

16:50.414 --> 16:54.543
OK. That's interesting.
Now, what the hell does it mean?

16:56.293 --> 17:01.455
Yeah, I know what it is. It is the legal code
of some ancient Babylonian king,

17:01.332 --> 17:06.125
probably 2000 BC. The question is,
what does it have to do with me?

17:07.810 --> 17:11.596
I wanna see my friends. I'm not
gonna translate another word until...

17:11.530 --> 17:13.606
What speech?

17:14.329 --> 17:16.287
What?

17:16.289 --> 17:19.409
What...? This one? Uh, it's Akkadian.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.326
What speech?

17:23.528 --> 17:26.861
Oh, uh... English.
It's much more modern...

17:26.807 --> 17:29.298
What fate Omoroca?

17:29.846 --> 17:32.052
I don't... I don't know.

17:32.047 --> 17:37.172
Look, my friends and I,
we came here in peace. We're explorers.

17:37.044 --> 17:41.505
- We'll share information if we have it.
- What fate Omoroca?!

17:41.403 --> 17:43.729
I don't... I don't know!

17:50.442 --> 17:52.102
<i>Nourishment.</i>

17:56.319 --> 17:57.980
Sleep.

17:58.638 --> 18:00.761
Look, um...

18:00.759 --> 18:03.000
I can't...

18:02.999 --> 18:05.240
I can't tell you what I don't know.

18:07.116 --> 18:08.659
You will.

18:08.678 --> 18:11.133
Or you will die.

18:32.392 --> 18:37.813
Oh, wow, look at these. Expedition
journals, one for each planet we visited.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.986
Here's one for Abydos.

18:45.307 --> 18:49.636
"Colonel O'Neill thinks I'm a geek.
I have no idea how to get us back."

18:49.547 --> 18:51.623
"I'll never get paid."

18:55.425 --> 18:58.759
Oh, wow. He must've written this
right after we got back.

18:59.584 --> 19:04.412
"Sha're is gone. Jack says we'll find her.
If anyone can, he can."

19:04.303 --> 19:06.875
Oh, come on, that's his diary!

19:06.862 --> 19:09.435
I mean, what's he gonna think if...

19:14.820 --> 19:18.355
I wonder what they're gonna do
with all this stuff.

19:18.900 --> 19:23.146
Maybe give it to a museum.
Or start one.

19:30.297 --> 19:36.050
This is a game from Ancient Egypt.
It is called "The Jackal and the Hound".

19:36.415 --> 19:39.451
It belonged to a Pharaoh's daughter.

19:39.815 --> 19:42.650
Daniel Jackson and I once played.

19:42.613 --> 19:46.859
He said it made him feel as though
he were touching history.

19:48.451 --> 19:51.073
Help! Help!

19:51.051 --> 19:54.421
- Whoa!
- What? What is it? You all right?

19:54.372 --> 19:57.538
I just had this image in my mind -
it's the second time.

19:57.490 --> 19:59.863
- What was it?
- Water, under...

19:59.851 --> 20:02.685
- Bubbles rising?
- That is correct.

20:02.648 --> 20:05.222
I have experienced it as well.

20:05.208 --> 20:09.454
- I'm tellin' you, somethin' is wrong.
- What's wrong is that Daniel is dead.

20:09.366 --> 20:11.739
- Is he?
- You were there. We were all there.

20:11.727 --> 20:17.183
Then why don't I believe it? I mean, I keep
expecting him to walk through the door.

20:17.046 --> 20:19.288
I keep getting these...

20:23.284 --> 20:27.031
Screw this packing.
Let's get back to the base.

20:37.759 --> 20:41.592
Where are my friends? Are they alive?
Are they here somewhere?

20:41.519 --> 20:45.599
- I demand to speak with them.
- They are gone.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.251
No. They would not leave without me.

20:48.238 --> 20:50.480
You are no more.

20:51.237 --> 20:54.736
- They think that I'm...?
- This memory, I gave them,

20:54.676 --> 20:57.214
so they would not return.

20:58.434 --> 20:59.978
Why?

21:01.154 --> 21:04.689
- Why are you doing this?
- You are oldest.

21:05.192 --> 21:07.481
You know of Babylon.

21:08.952 --> 21:12.202
What fate Omoroca?

21:12.152 --> 21:16.814
OK. OK. If my life is on the line here,
I need to know more.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.349
What is Omoroca?

21:19.351 --> 21:21.593
<i>Who is Omoroca?</i>

21:22.630 --> 21:24.705
My mate!

21:27.228 --> 21:29.470
What? On Earth, in Babylon?

21:29.468 --> 21:31.461
Yes.

21:31.468 --> 21:35.335
And you don't know
what's happened to her?

21:35.747 --> 21:41.038
- That was 4,000 years ago.
- Knowledge, you have knowledge.

21:40.904 --> 21:45.816
Of Babylon, yes. But only a small amount
of knowledge has survived all that time.

21:45.703 --> 21:49.570
The knowledge is there, in your mind.

21:49.503 --> 21:54.130
You're asking me to remember something
that happened thousands of years

21:54.021 --> 21:59.017
before I was born, to tell you
something that I couldn't possibly know.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.189
You deceive.

22:01.181 --> 22:04.549
Why? God, why, why,
why would I do that?!

22:04.500 --> 22:06.705
You serve the Goa'uld.

22:06.699 --> 22:08.904
No! No.

22:08.898 --> 22:12.847
I lost my wife - my mate -
because of the Goa'uld.

22:12.777 --> 22:15.066
They took her from me
and I despise them.

22:15.057 --> 22:18.840
Then tell me what fate.

22:18.775 --> 22:21.348
<i>I don't know!</i>

22:21.933 --> 22:24.556
I don't know!

22:24.534 --> 22:29.873
Your brain chemistry was compromised.
All of you have low levels of serotonin.

22:29.732 --> 22:32.982
- Which means?
- It's a neurotransmitter. It affects moods.

22:32.932 --> 22:37.179
Low levels would account for depression,
but not these other effects.

22:37.092 --> 22:39.961
I want you to take a look at this.

22:39.931 --> 22:42.422
This dark spot appears
on all of your scans.

22:42.410 --> 22:47.286
It's almost too small to worry about, but
for the fact it's in the part of the cortex...

22:47.169 --> 22:51.000
<i>Offworld activation.</i>

22:50.927 --> 22:53.003
Colonel? Wait!

23:03.005 --> 23:05.839
<i>Colonel?</i>

23:08.682 --> 23:13.429
<i>Welcome home, SG-6.
Report for debriefing at 1600 hours.</i>

23:14.282 --> 23:16.773
What... what are you looking for?

23:17.801 --> 23:20.554
I just... I thought...

23:20.520 --> 23:25.099
- Daniel Jackson was returning.
- I thought the same thing. Why?

23:26.319 --> 23:28.478
Is he gone or isn't he?

23:28.479 --> 23:30.684
You saw it happen.

23:30.679 --> 23:34.593
Somebody wanna tell me what's
goin' on? Cos I'm startin' to lose it.

23:34.517 --> 23:36.058
<i>Doctor?</i>

23:36.076 --> 23:41.201
There seems to be some question in their
minds as to whether Dr. Jackson is dead.

23:43.355 --> 23:46.392
You were the only witnesses.
If you deny what you saw...

23:46.355 --> 23:49.723
No, sir. I saw him die. We all did.

23:49.913 --> 23:51.990
I know he's gone.

23:54.231 --> 23:57.352
But I know he's still alive.

24:00.590 --> 24:03.082
Sir, we've got to go ba...

24:04.910 --> 24:07.827
You're not going
anywhere but the infirmary.

24:12.307 --> 24:16.388
I wanna know what's going on.
One of our people could still be out there.

24:16.307 --> 24:18.383
Yes, sir.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.521
You cannot leave this place.

24:51.538 --> 24:56.034
You will tell me all you know of Babylon.

25:03.415 --> 25:06.085
Do you know how much has been lost?

25:07.615 --> 25:12.193
Great libraries burned to the ground,
cities destroyed by wars.

25:13.492 --> 25:16.411
Most of our history is buried in time.

25:16.372 --> 25:19.041
You are afraid.

25:19.571 --> 25:21.896
Yes. I'm afraid.

25:23.730 --> 25:28.227
I'm afraid that you ask the impossible of
me, and will not allow me to return home.

25:28.128 --> 25:30.964
Omoroca was afraid.

25:32.248 --> 25:33.991
- On Earth?
- Yes.

25:34.009 --> 25:36.677
Of what? Of who? I mean...

25:36.647 --> 25:39.434
Give me somethin' to work
with here, a time frame.

25:39.406 --> 25:41.280
Babylon.

25:44.525 --> 25:48.023
A name. A name of
someone she spoke of.

25:49.365 --> 25:51.273
Belus.

25:51.285 --> 25:53.157
Belus?

25:53.802 --> 25:55.676
Belus.

25:59.242 --> 26:01.733
Belus... something.

26:03.681 --> 26:05.092
Yes.

26:06.279 --> 26:09.115
Yes. Um... Belus something.

26:09.079 --> 26:11.830
Yes. Berosus, a contemporary
of Alexander the Great.

26:11.798 --> 26:16.508
He studied some very old,
ancient Babylonian texts, pre-Flood.

26:16.397 --> 26:19.767
- Tell me more.
- Omoroca feared Belus.

26:19.717 --> 26:23.666
Yes. Yes, he was a conqueror.
Tell me more. I need more.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.121
Come on.

26:26.155 --> 26:30.817
You cannot expect me to remember every
text that I studied ten or twelve years ago!

26:31.634 --> 26:35.217
Come back to Earth with me.
My books, my library, they're all there.

26:35.153 --> 26:37.442
You serve the Goa'uld.

26:37.432 --> 26:42.058
No! God, no! How many times
do I have to tell you? No!

26:41.951 --> 26:45.153
It is the fate of humans.

26:45.111 --> 26:49.772
That, Omoroca could not prevent.

26:53.147 --> 26:58.190
Omoroca came to Earth to fight the
Goa'uld? That is why she came to Earth?

26:58.067 --> 26:59.727
Yes.

27:01.425 --> 27:04.876
- Then my people owe her a great debt.
- She failed.

27:04.826 --> 27:09.488
No. No, there was an uprising,
a rebellion, in Ancient Egypt.

27:09.384 --> 27:14.840
- Maybe she helped plant the seed.
- Goa'uld are among you, within you.

27:14.942 --> 27:19.023
Teal'c. You think because Teal'c
carries around a larval Goa'uld...

27:19.942 --> 27:24.021
No. You see, he joined us
in the fight against the Goa'uld.

27:23.942 --> 27:28.153
You see, in the years - in the thousands
of years since Omoroca was there -

27:28.059 --> 27:31.393
we have become a civilisation
that rivals that of the Goa'uld.

27:31.338 --> 27:34.459
That's how far we've come. We are free.

27:37.138 --> 27:39.807
If you just come back with me,
I can show you.

27:44.376 --> 27:47.746
Knowledge is here.

27:56.814 --> 27:59.269
Catchy tune.

27:59.252 --> 28:02.871
Wanna explain to me what
this "mood music" is all about?

28:02.811 --> 28:07.224
Doctor McKenzie said it might help you
remember specifically what happened

28:07.131 --> 28:09.253
if you listen.

28:09.250 --> 28:14.789
We're simply using these sounds as a tool
to increase your level of concentration.

28:15.808 --> 28:18.299
Well, it's very distracting.

28:19.607 --> 28:22.098
Look, we're trying to play...

28:23.486 --> 28:25.443
Teal'c?

28:38.442 --> 28:40.186
Kree tak!

28:40.203 --> 28:42.528
Teal'c, snap out of it.

28:45.561 --> 28:48.563
I saw the death of Daniel Jackson.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.615
It's all right. The same thing
keeps happening to me.

28:55.718 --> 28:59.336
All three of you have
conflicting feelings about Daniel.

28:59.278 --> 29:02.231
I know he's dead. I know he's alive.

29:02.198 --> 29:05.648
Both realities can't be true,
yet both seem to be.

29:05.596 --> 29:08.086
It's a conflict that will have to be resolved

29:08.076 --> 29:12.240
before I'll authorise your
return to active duty, Colonel.

29:21.472 --> 29:25.090
My friends, the others who came here,
you made them think I was...

29:25.031 --> 29:27.107
- Lost to them.
- Dead.

29:27.111 --> 29:29.186
- Yes.
- How?

29:30.510 --> 29:34.377
I gave them the memory of your death.

29:35.990 --> 29:38.563
If you can influence memory like that...

29:40.708 --> 29:43.329
why don't you search my mind?

29:44.467 --> 29:49.971
You say the memory is there, that I must
have come across it and don't remember.

29:49.826 --> 29:51.700
Yes.

29:51.705 --> 29:54.162
Then take it.

29:54.144 --> 29:58.439
I mean, if you have the power,
if you have the technology, use it.

29:59.503 --> 30:01.626
It would damage.

30:01.623 --> 30:05.454
Well, given my options,
I am willing to take the risk.

30:07.102 --> 30:09.593
I am not.

30:14.858 --> 30:16.732
Look...

30:19.298 --> 30:23.795
I don't have 4,000 years. Maybe you can
afford to search all that time, but I can't.

30:26.215 --> 30:29.134
There will be much pain.

30:33.175 --> 30:35.251
You may die.

30:35.255 --> 30:38.209
I'd rather die than stay here,
knowing I will never see

30:38.173 --> 30:41.009
my wife or my friends again.

30:47.931 --> 30:53.221
The, uh... fire Daniel was caught in
lashed out toward us...

30:54.570 --> 30:57.654
overwhelmed us when we went to help.

30:57.608 --> 30:59.684
It was hot.

31:00.488 --> 31:02.943
It was... very hot.

31:04.686 --> 31:08.933
Uh, there was water...
a body of water nearby.

31:11.486 --> 31:14.403
Sir, how many times are we
gonna have to go through this?

31:14.365 --> 31:16.855
Try to bear with me, Colonel.

31:17.763 --> 31:21.298
How long do you estimate you
were on the other side of the gate?

31:21.242 --> 31:23.816
Uh, 20 minutes. 25 maybe.

31:23.922 --> 31:26.544
Half-hour, tops.

31:26.521 --> 31:28.560
- Teal'c?
- I concur.

31:28.561 --> 31:31.230
You were gone almost four hours.

31:31.201 --> 31:35.199
- I don't think that's possible, sir.
- I can show you the mission logs.

31:35.119 --> 31:39.663
- What happened to the other 3Ë hours?
- I've had much success with hypnosis.

31:42.278 --> 31:44.152
Hypnosis.

31:46.277 --> 31:50.192
I'm not a big fan of that "bark like
a chicken, cluck like a dog" stuff.

31:50.115 --> 31:53.450
Colonel, please. Hypnosis is
a modern therapeutic practice.

31:53.395 --> 31:56.065
On me, your procedure
will not be successful.

31:56.035 --> 31:59.403
General, can't we go about
this the old-fashioned way?

31:59.554 --> 32:02.555
Request permission to go back
and find out what happened.

32:02.512 --> 32:05.384
- No!
- Sir, we can't do that.

32:07.912 --> 32:10.580
I... I don't know why I just said that.

32:10.550 --> 32:14.335
If that isn't a conditioned response,
I don't know what is.

32:15.269 --> 32:18.604
So... someone's been
messin' with our heads.

32:18.989 --> 32:21.480
There is... one way to find out.

32:24.708 --> 32:29.287
Colonel, I've had some experience with
hypnosis in an undergrad psych course.

32:29.185 --> 32:31.676
Let me take a shot at it.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.990
I volunteer.

32:47.461 --> 32:50.628
You're now completely relaxed.

32:50.580 --> 32:54.578
I want you to go back to
the day you last saw Daniel.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.416
He's with you now. Can you see him?

32:57.980 --> 32:58.894
Yes.

32:58.939 --> 33:02.557
- He's burning.
- No. Go back further.

33:02.499 --> 33:04.787
You've just arrived.

33:04.778 --> 33:08.063
Now look around,
and tell me where you are.

33:08.416 --> 33:11.501
- Water.
- You're standing next to water.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.330
Salt water.

33:28.971 --> 33:31.972
<i>Looks like some kind of...</i>

33:31.932 --> 33:34.173
ocean.

33:50.646 --> 33:52.686
What's that thing out there?

33:58.724 --> 34:01.845
- Did you see that?
- It's coming right towards us.

35:01.070 --> 35:03.442
Uh... it's cuneiform.

35:05.028 --> 35:09.239
I think he wants to know if we're
from the world that built Babylon.

35:25.143 --> 35:27.514
I'm Daniel. This is... Jack.

35:32.742 --> 35:36.786
- Help him!
- Move on... to what happened next.

35:39.021 --> 35:41.226
<i>Darkness.</i>

35:41.219 --> 35:43.094
<i>Cold.</i>

35:43.739 --> 35:45.612
<i>Wet.</i>

35:53.817 --> 35:56.307
We've gotta get to the water!

36:02.735 --> 36:05.059
<i>- Captain...
- Jack, get out!</i>

36:05.054 --> 36:08.672
- Carter!
- My God, Colonel. We left him behind.

36:08.612 --> 36:11.483
- We left him behind.
- I know.

36:11.452 --> 36:13.527
It's all right.

36:14.490 --> 36:16.567
We're goin' back.

36:18.411 --> 36:20.487
We're goin' back.

36:23.369 --> 36:29.324
The memory of your history, your race,
is within you,

36:29.168 --> 36:31.623
beneath the surface.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.684
I hope so.

36:33.686 --> 36:36.639
You may be damaged.

36:36.606 --> 36:38.599
I understand.

36:38.605 --> 36:41.012
You could die.

36:42.005 --> 36:45.090
Well, we don't really
have a choice, do we?

36:48.563 --> 36:51.233
Remember Omoroca.

36:52.402 --> 36:54.275
Omoroca.

36:56.561 --> 36:58.434
Omoroca.

37:05.039 --> 37:07.791
And in that place there was Omoroca,

37:08.757 --> 37:11.878
a woman who came forth
from the Heavenly Egg...

37:14.356 --> 37:15.554
- I can't!
- More.

37:15.597 --> 37:16.760
I can't.

37:19.275 --> 37:21.849
...who walked among men by day,

37:21.835 --> 37:26.579
but at night... she would retreat
to the Great Sea to sleep.

37:27.273 --> 37:29.563
- One of the beings called Oannes.
- Yes.

37:29.554 --> 37:31.878
- Omoroca.
- Yes.

37:31.873 --> 37:33.746
- Omoroca.
- More.

37:38.032 --> 37:43.108
The God Belus came down unto Babylon,
unto the place of Omoroca...

37:45.510 --> 37:48.844
and cut the woman asunder. Oh, God!

37:49.108 --> 37:51.351
Oh, God, he killed her.

37:57.786 --> 38:00.788
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's all I ever knew, I swear.

38:02.224 --> 38:04.467
Belus?

38:04.465 --> 38:06.373
He was a Goa'uld.

38:06.583 --> 38:08.456
Yes.

38:09.543 --> 38:13.077
He murdered... my love!

38:17.422 --> 38:19.130
I'm sorry.

38:33.418 --> 38:35.291
Daniel!

38:37.496 --> 38:41.661
- Maybe we're too late.
- I'm not leavin' without him this time.

39:16.766 --> 39:18.842
Don't shoot!

39:29.525 --> 39:32.016
Nem, you have your answer.
Now let us go.

39:39.242 --> 39:41.233
You may go.

39:44.239 --> 39:47.525
I'm sorry I couldn't give you
the answer you wanted.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.396
I am sorry also.

39:55.838 --> 39:58.590
We could still become friends,
your people and mine.

39:58.556 --> 40:01.474
That's why we were here.
We meant no harm.

40:02.635 --> 40:05.387
Perhaps in time.

40:08.355 --> 40:11.972
- Right.
- And in time, Daniel...

40:12.434 --> 40:17.427
you will find what fate... Sha're.

40:37.947 --> 40:41.695
Uh, this... this is a long story.

40:41.626 --> 40:44.543
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Tell us about it over sushi.

40:45.746 --> 40:47.737
That's funny.

40:47.744 --> 40:50.746
I will, after I go get some sleep.

40:51.744 --> 40:54.152
Ah, home!

40:54.742 --> 40:58.492
<i>- Yeah, about that apartment.
- Oh, you didn't!</i>

40:58.422 --> 41:01.588
<i>The, uh, day after
the memorial service.</i>

41:01.541 --> 41:04.911
- Memorial service?
- The colonel said some really nice things.

41:04.860 --> 41:06.936
He... he did?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.773
He did?
