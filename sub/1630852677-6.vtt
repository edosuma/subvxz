09:38.926 --> 09:41.189
This is a home invasion!

09:41.232 --> 09:43.887
Why are you alone?
Where is shit for brains?

09:43.931 --> 09:45.933
Did you get a divorce?

09:45.976 --> 09:47.717
Divorce is against
my religion

09:47.761 --> 09:49.632
unless it's initiated
by the man,

09:49.676 --> 09:51.721
which is why
I'm never getting married.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.071
That is good news
for men everywhere.

09:54.115 --> 09:57.901
I see that you have agreed
to my terms.

09:57.945 --> 10:02.689
You give me my ball,
and I give you your dog back.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.474
Funny story about the ball,

10:05.517 --> 10:07.519
really funny, actually.

10:07.563 --> 10:12.220
Why do I feel like this
is n-not going to be funny?

10:12.263 --> 10:14.483
Well, you know how Max

10:14.526 --> 10:16.572
stole the ball from you.
- Mm.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
I stole it from him.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.707
And then somebody stole it
from me.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.230
Isn't that hysterical?

10:22.273 --> 10:24.711
What?
Who stole it from you?

10:24.754 --> 10:27.888
Probably the government.
Crazy, right?

10:27.931 --> 10:30.586
Someday you'll laugh about it.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.979
I'll take the dog now.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.677
No!
You will not have the dog!

10:34.721 --> 10:37.245
<i>Hey, put me--put me down.</i>

10:38.550 --> 10:40.248
- Oh, no.
- Yes!

10:40.291 --> 10:41.902
Yes, you should be afraid

10:41.945 --> 10:43.338
of what I will do to you.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.688
That ball can do more
than just grow hair

10:45.732 --> 10:47.777
all over your
stupid fart friend.

10:47.821 --> 10:48.996
I can control its energy.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.562
I can turn you inside out!

10:50.606 --> 10:51.955
And then you will
go to school

10:51.999 --> 10:53.565
with your inside-out body!
- Harry.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.830
<i>Turn around, you dummy.</i>

10:58.701 --> 11:01.443
Get away! No!

11:01.486 --> 11:03.706
Oh! 42!

11:03.750 --> 11:06.578
<i>I-I-I...</i> <i></i>

11:06.622 --> 11:10.408
<i>Can't see. I can--</i> <i>
Is it--is it you, cousin?</i>

11:10.452 --> 11:12.802
Yes, it is me.
I am here.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.413
You are going to be okay. <i>
- No.</i>

11:15.457 --> 11:17.851
<i>It's my time.</i>

11:17.894 --> 11:20.636
<i>I've--I've lived a good life.</i>

11:20.680 --> 11:21.942
<i>Oh, you should've fed the dog</i>

11:21.985 --> 11:23.421
<i>before you put him</i> <i>
in there with me.</i>

11:23.465 --> 11:26.990
No, you--you cannot die!

11:27.034 --> 11:30.515
I'm sorry that I told you
you were not my real family.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.866
You had angered me by demanding

11:32.909 --> 11:36.217
that we watch
home-improvement shows.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.262
You live in water.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.351
I mean, what do you care
about breakfast nooks?

11:40.395 --> 11:42.005
I'm sorry!

11:42.049 --> 11:46.967
<i>It's okay.</i>

11:49.056 --> 11:52.668
<i>You have real family now...</i>

11:52.712 --> 11:54.931
<i>i-in New York.</i>

11:54.975 --> 11:57.978

11:58.021 --> 12:00.023
<i>Find your alien...</i>

12:00.067 --> 12:01.764
- <i>
- For me.</i>

12:03.505 --> 12:06.116
I will never forget you.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.640
<i>It was an honorable death.</i>

12:08.684 --> 12:11.556

You're not Asta!

You--Asta!

15:01.552 --> 15:03.206
Asta!

15:04.120 --> 15:06.470
Asta!
- Get over here right now!

15:06.514 --> 15:09.256
I told you to stay close.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.171
Sorry.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.694
It's okay.

15:12.737 --> 15:15.610
Wow.
I forgot how awesome this is.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.917
Yeah, right?

15:17.960 --> 15:20.702
Mr. Grady used to let me
train up here.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.574
Yeah, my dad used to bring me
up here when I was a kid.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.228
Well, take a few more,
and then we'll head up top

15:25.272 --> 15:26.882
where there's a real view.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.844
Uh, u-up top?

15:32.888 --> 15:35.282
How are we gonna get up there?

15:37.588 --> 15:40.461
You're gonna love it.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.854
Next!
What can I get you?

15:42.898 --> 15:46.510
Um, I'd like two slices
of pepperoni.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.034
Anything else?

15:48.077 --> 15:49.949
And...

15:49.992 --> 15:51.689
We were sent here.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.476
We got a signal.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.434
Does that mean anything to you?

15:57.478 --> 15:59.262
Hmm?

15:59.306 --> 16:01.264
You want something?

16:01.308 --> 16:03.484
Does an alien live here?

16:04.746 --> 16:07.662
I'll take one pepperoni slice.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.359
One sausage slice.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.579
One more pepperoni slice.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.494
One more sausage slice.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.975
I don't need this shit.
$34.51.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.020
Make it one more slice
of sausage.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.195
Harry.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.154
Also, we would like
to meet the alien,

16:21.197 --> 16:22.633
if you did not hear me before.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.375
How many pieces of pepperoni
did I order?

16:25.419 --> 16:27.116
You pay for your pizza,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.162
or you get out.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.467
Of course.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.686
Here, have some closet cash.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.601
No! My God. Oh.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.256
Uh, um, you know what?

16:36.299 --> 16:38.040
Uh, go ahead, keep the change.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.999
Thank you so much.

16:44.568 --> 16:45.700
I didn't realize
I had to teach you

16:45.743 --> 16:47.136
how to order food.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.920
This is incredible.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.010
Am I supposed to eat the plate?

16:51.053 --> 16:52.663
- No.
- Can I?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.491
Mmm, it's oiled.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.363
Mmm.

16:58.495 --> 16:59.931
I don't get it.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.803
This is the number you got.

17:01.846 --> 17:04.806
Something has to be here!

17:04.849 --> 17:06.460
I wonder if the number's
for whoever had it

17:06.503 --> 17:08.157
before the pizza place.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.768
They have to make that
information public, don't they?

17:10.812 --> 17:13.771
What are you doing?

17:13.815 --> 17:16.296
Are you listening to me?

17:16.339 --> 17:19.734
It says "Goliath."

17:22.780 --> 17:23.868
<i>♪</i>

17:23.912 --> 17:25.218
How do you know that?

17:25.261 --> 17:29.309
Because it is written
in my alien language.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.581
Told you you could do it.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.104
Ah.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.540
Look at this view.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.238
Worth it?

17:45.281 --> 17:47.153
Worth it.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.329
Oh, thanks.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.505
Shit, I didn't think of it.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.333
I should've told you
to bring Kate.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.335
She would love this.

17:55.378 --> 17:58.120
Oh, she, uh, took Max to
her mom's for a couple nights.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.732
Oh, Benny, all alone.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.300
Let me guess, cartoons
and cereal for breakfast,

18:04.344 --> 18:07.129
cartoons and cereal for dinner.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.698
Ah, definition
of a perfect day.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.352
And with Kate gone,
I don't have to worry

18:12.395 --> 18:13.788
about holding in my farts.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.573
You don't fart
around your wi--

18:16.617 --> 18:18.053

of being married

18:18.097 --> 18:20.011

around your wife?

18:20.055 --> 18:22.710
Yeah, I don't do
a lot of things around Kate.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.321
What does that mean?

18:25.365 --> 18:27.715
No, I don't know.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.718
Sometimes I just feel

18:30.761 --> 18:32.937
like I can't be myself
in front of her,

18:32.981 --> 18:35.679
you know, can't do the things
that I want to do.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.074
I thought you guys
were getting along great.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.945
The way she talks about it,
your house is all

18:40.989 --> 18:42.730
handcuffs and frozen dildos.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.210
Oh, yeah, she was--

18:44.253 --> 18:46.603
she was just kidding
about that stuff.

18:46.647 --> 18:50.564
No, she wasn't.
No, it's real.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.870
And it lives inside me
forever now.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.263
It's little things.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.744
I-I have this wall hanging

18:56.787 --> 18:58.441
that I-I want to put up
in the living room,

18:58.485 --> 18:59.790
but she'd hate it,

18:59.834 --> 19:02.576

for six months.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.186
Oh, that's messed up.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.535
I mean, it's
your house, too, right?

19:05.579 --> 19:07.189
Just do what you want.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.757
If she doesn't like it,
that's her issue.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.411
It's not that simple.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.807
Oh, shoot.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.636
Gee, I didn't know
things were like that...

19:19.680 --> 19:21.421
for you.

19:21.464 --> 19:25.033
<i>♪</i>

19:25.076 --> 19:29.211
I'm sorry
that I kissed you that night.

19:29.255 --> 19:32.519
I shouldn't have done that.
It was a shitty thing to do.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.955
Sorry.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.045
Ah, you couldn't help it.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.525
I mean...

19:38.568 --> 19:40.266
look at me.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.269
Yeah, you're quite a sight.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.620
So apparently Goliath
is a famous street artist

19:46.663 --> 19:48.317
and a total recluse.

19:48.361 --> 19:49.971
He's done a bunch of murals
in the city.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.320
But each time

19:51.364 --> 19:53.366
he does a new one,
it appears overnight.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.542
They've even nicknamed him
"The Ghost of New York."

19:55.585 --> 19:57.370
That does not make sense.

19:57.413 --> 20:01.025
Ghosts do not even have hands
to hold a paintbrush.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.244
Shit!

20:02.288 --> 20:04.028
Where? Where? Where?

20:04.072 --> 20:05.987
No, no, listen to this.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.815
"Nobody's ever met Goliath,

20:07.858 --> 20:10.513
but countless people
have tried."
