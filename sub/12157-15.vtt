WEBVTT

00:04.672 --> 00:06.407
HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU
GAWKING AT?

00:06.440 --> 00:08.909
ARE THE NEIGHBOR'S DOGS GOING
AT IT ON THE FRONT LAWN AGAIN?

00:08.942 --> 00:10.678
MANDY AND KYLE
ARE MAKIN' OUT.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.081
AW, I DON'T WANNA HEAR THIS.
EITHER WAY,

00:13.114 --> 00:14.682
JUST SPRAY 'EM BOTH
WITH THE HOSE.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.686
GOOD NIGHT, MANDY.
NIGHT, KYLE.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.224
HAVE A NICE DATE?
UH-HUH.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.325
KYLE'S SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.594
BUT I THINK
I'M WEARING HIM DOWN.

00:29.763 --> 00:30.731
ARE YOU SNEAKING OUT?
SHH.

00:30.764 --> 00:31.732
(lowered voice)
BOYD'S SLEEPING.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.534
AND I AM 23, OKAY?
I DO NOT SNEAK OUT.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.169
I LEAVE QUIETLY
WITHOUT TELLING DAD.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.105
(giggles)

00:38.439 --> 00:39.573
(whispering) PSST. MOM.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.442
HMM? OH. UH, MIKE, HONEY?

00:41.475 --> 00:43.844
WILL YOU BRING
THE RECYCLING TO THE GARAGE?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.446
(Mike) ALL RIGHT.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.715
(lowered voice) THANK YOU!
I'LL BE AT RYAN'S, OKAY?

00:47.748 --> 00:49.683
UH, KEEP YOUR EAR OPEN
IN CASE BOYD WAKES UP?

00:49.717 --> 00:50.951
YOU KNOW, HONEY,
I-I-I DON'T LIKE

00:50.984 --> 00:52.353
BEING IN THE MIDDLE
LIKE THIS.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.455
I-I'M REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE
LYING TO YOUR FATHER...

00:54.488 --> 00:56.557
FOR YOUR STUFF.
MM.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.958
MOM, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M ASKING YOU

00:57.991 --> 00:59.560
TO DO SOMETHING
RIDICULOUS, OKAY?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.295
NOW I'M GONNA GO
PUT MY CAR IN NEUTRAL,

01:01.329 --> 01:02.863
YOU HELP ME
PUSH IT DOWN THE BLOCK.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.465
ROLL IT DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.
(kisses)

01:04.498 --> 01:06.434
MM. YOU ARE THE BEST.
OKAY, OKAY.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.569
ALL RIGHT. RECYCLING'S OUT.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.438
YOU CAN TEXT
YOUR BUDDY AL GORE

01:10.471 --> 01:13.574
HE CAN TAKE ANOTHER TRIP
IN HIS PRIVATE JET.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.575
(kiss)
I'M GONNA GO TO BED.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.210
YEAH, I'LL BE UP
IN A MINUTE.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.745
OH, AND TELL KRISTIN
IT'D BE EASIER THIS TIME

01:17.778 --> 01:20.281
IF SHE REMEMBERS
TO RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE.

01:22.616 --> 01:26.520
-- Captions by VITA --

01:29.423 --> 01:32.560
(door opens in distance)

01:32.593 --> 01:33.661
WHAT WAS THAT?

01:33.694 --> 01:36.997
NO, NO, NO. STAY IN BED.
COME ON. IT'S COLD.

01:37.030 --> 01:41.435
(muttering)
IT'S COLD BECAUSE OF THOSE
SIZE-9 POPSICLES YOU CALL FEET.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.104
COME ON. OH, MIKE,
JUST LET IT GO.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.773
SOMEONE CAME IN
THROUGH THE BACK GATE.

01:45.806 --> 01:49.076
IT COULD BE A CRIMINAL,
OR WORSE.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.978
IT'S WORSE.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.112
IT'S ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS

01:52.146 --> 01:54.182
CRAWLING THROUGH
THE KITCHEN WINDOW.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.449
OH, HONEY, COME ON.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.484
CAN'T WE JUST
TELL KRISTIN THE TRUTH?

01:56.517 --> 01:58.152
THAT YOU KNOW
SHE'S SEEING RYAN,

01:58.186 --> 01:59.620
SO SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO
SNEAK IN WINDOWS

01:59.653 --> 02:00.488
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.656
IT'S NOT KRISTIN.
IT'S MANDY.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.024
MANDY?

02:04.057 --> 02:06.059
DON'T NEED TO HURRY.
SHE'S STUCK.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.632
WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE THINK
SHE'S DOING?

02:11.665 --> 02:14.702
IT'S FOUR HOURS
PAST HER CURFEW.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.669
AND SHE HAS A KEY.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.105
UGH.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.473
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.542
MAYBE SHE JUST SNUCK OUT
TO MEET UP WITH KYLE.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.678
I GUESS THERE ARE WORSE GUYS
SHE COULD BE WITH AT 3:00 A.M.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.614
THERE'S NO NICE GUYS
OUT THERE AT 3:00 A.M.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.781
I KNOW. I USED TO BE ONE.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.850
THEY'RE ONLY LOOKING
FOR ONE THING, HONEY.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.686
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
THREE OR FOUR THINGS.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.288
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR JOB.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.623
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DEAL
WITH THIS STUFF WITH THE GIRLS

02:35.656 --> 02:36.790
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS
KIND OF THING, YOU KNOW?

02:36.824 --> 02:38.025
AND I'LL DEAL WITH OUR SONS.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.228
(chuckles)
WE DON'T HAVE SONS.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.664
AND THANKS FOR DROPPING
THE BALL ON THAT ONE.
OH...

02:43.697 --> 02:47.668
CAN'T YOU JUST HAVE--JUST HAVE
A TALK WITH HER. JUST GO--
FINE. (stammers) YOU KNOW,
I'LL GO LAY DOWN THE LAW.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.539
YOU THINK I'M HAPPY SITTIN'
IN HERE WITH NO SON TO YELL AT?
(door opens)

02:51.572 --> 02:53.674
(sighs)
(knocks on door)

02:53.707 --> 02:54.708
MANDY?

02:56.944 --> 02:58.712
OH, NICE TRY.
(door closes)

02:58.746 --> 03:01.715
I KNOW YOU'RE AWAKE.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.485
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU LEFT YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.854
(car alarm chirps)

03:06.887 --> 03:08.689
(switch clicks)
NO...

03:08.722 --> 03:11.091
OH, MAN, COME ON.
COME ON.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.827
HONEY, YOU'RE IN
REAL TROUBLE HERE.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.596
YOU BROKE
THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.665
I KNOW. I MISSED CURFEW.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.033
NO. YOU LET YOUR DAD
FIND OUT.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.738
NOW, LOOK, I CAN'T STOP YOU
FROM DOING WHATEVER IT IS

03:24.772 --> 03:26.540
YOU AND KYLE ARE DOING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

03:26.574 --> 03:28.376
BUT, HONEY, OUT OF RESPECT
TO YOUR FATHER,

03:28.409 --> 03:31.412
GET BETTER AT DECEIVING HIM.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.415
OKAY. I'LL TRY HARDER.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.417
(kisses)
I KNOW YOU WILL.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.885
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.587
(mouths words)
(zips)

03:39.620 --> 03:40.588
(exhales)

03:40.621 --> 03:43.891
OKAY. (sighs)

03:43.924 --> 03:46.694
YOU WON'T CATCH MANDY
COMING IN LATE ANYMORE.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.761
GOOD.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.197
AND I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING HAS HAPPENED YET

03:50.230 --> 03:52.566
WITH HER AND KYLE.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.634
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.636
A MOM CAN TELL.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.971
(locker slams)
* ZIP-A-DEE DOO DAH

03:58.005 --> 03:59.206
* ZIP-A-DEE AY

03:59.239 --> 04:01.074
HEY!

04:01.108 --> 04:05.112
* MY, OH, MY,
WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY *

04:05.145 --> 04:06.947
(coffee pouring)

04:12.953 --> 04:15.155
WHAT'S WITH KYLE?

04:15.188 --> 04:17.791
(Kyle whistling)
WHY'S HE SO HAPPY?

04:17.825 --> 04:22.496
FIRST OFF, HE'S GOT
THAT IDIOT THING GOING ON.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.232
AND SECONDLY,
HE WAS OUT TILL 3:00 A.M.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.835
DOING GOD-KNOWS-WHAT
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.603
I THOUGHT
HE AND KRISTIN BROKE UP.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.804
ACTUALLY,
HE'S DATING MANDY NOW.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.807
KYLE PULLED OFF SISTERS?

04:38.812 --> 04:41.482
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

04:41.515 --> 04:45.819
HE'LL BE TELLING THAT STORY
IN BARS THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

04:45.853 --> 04:49.923
ED, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY DAUGHTERS.
(mutters)

04:49.957 --> 04:52.660
KYLE, LET ME SPEAK TO YOU.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.694
OH, NO, NO. YOU'RE TOO ANGRY.
NO, NO.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.796
LET ME TELL KYLE
TO KEEP HIS MITTS OFF MANDY.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.932
IT IS MANDY HE'S PUTTING
HIS MITTS ON NOW, RIGHT?

04:58.966 --> 05:02.302
MORNING, SIRS. IT IS
A BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?

05:02.336 --> 05:04.672
SIT. SIT DOWN, SON.
SIT. HAVE A SEAT.
THANK YOU.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.976
(door closes)
KYLE, UH, REMEMBER
THAT TINY FISHING POND

05:09.009 --> 05:11.845
I-I USED TO TAKE YOU TO
UP ON MOUNT EVANS?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.548
YEAH. IT WAS GREAT.
I SHOULD GO BACK THERE.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.717
NO, YOU SHOULDN'T. NO.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.785
SEE, IT'S A BAD IDEA

05:17.818 --> 05:21.154
TO KEEP CATCHING FISH
IN THE SAME POND.

05:21.188 --> 05:25.526
HUH? HUH? WHY DON'T YOU JUST
MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT, HUH?

05:25.559 --> 05:28.362
YEAH.
TAKE YOUR POLE ELSEWHERE.

05:28.396 --> 05:31.699
ALL RIGHT?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.634
WHY?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.536
IT'S A GREAT POND.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.673
I MEAN,
I COULD FISH IN THAT POND

05:39.707 --> 05:41.942
ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.082
WELL, YOU'RE YOUNG.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.852
KYLE, I NEED TO KNOW

05:51.885 --> 05:53.987
WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.491
AND UNLIKE ED, TRY TO REMEMBER
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.893
WELL, LET'S SEE.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.730
UH, WE WERE WATCHING TV
FOR A WHILE.
UH-HUH.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.732
UH, THERE'S A RAT LOOSE
IN MY APARTMENT.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.401
SO MY ROOMMATE GOT A SNAKE
TO CATCH IT.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.404
AND, UH, LAST NIGHT,
WE COULDN'T FIND THE SNAKE.

06:10.438 --> 06:14.174
SO NOW WE'RE GETTING
A MONGOOSE.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.943
AND BECAUSE WE LEARNED
OUR LESSON,

06:15.976 --> 06:17.911
A MONGOOSE LEASH.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.352
MANDY DOESN'T
REALLY LIKE RATS,

06:25.385 --> 06:29.122
SNAKES, OR MONGOOSE SHOPPING
ON THE INTERNET,

06:29.156 --> 06:31.224
SO I TOOK HER HOME
AROUND 10:00.

06:31.258 --> 06:34.728
BUT SHE SNUCK BACK OUT
AND DIDN'T COME IN UNTIL 3:00.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.864
WHAT?

06:36.897 --> 06:40.100
MM-HMM.
NO. SHE TEXTED ME
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BED.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.437
OH, GOD. DO YOU THINK
SHE WAS OUT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

06:43.471 --> 06:45.473
DON'T GO THERE, SON.
SHE'S NOT WORTH IT.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.421
BOYD'S COMING.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.323
(gasps)

07:03.356 --> 07:04.525
PSYCH!

07:06.460 --> 07:09.062
WOW, YOU JUMPED AWAY
PRETTY FAST THERE.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.098
CAN I HAVE MY GUM BACK?

07:11.131 --> 07:12.566
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST TENSE.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.836
ALL THIS SNEAKIN' AROUND.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.606
MOMMY!

07:18.639 --> 07:20.608
DOUBLE-PSYCH.
HE WAS COMING.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.344
WHAT ARE YOU
AND DADDY DOING?

07:24.377 --> 07:26.313
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
GO PICK OUT A BOOK, OKAY?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.649
I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE.

07:28.682 --> 07:29.950
OKAY, LOOK,

07:29.983 --> 07:32.019
I GET WHY WE'RE KEEPING
A LOW PROFILE AROUND YOUR DAD,

07:32.052 --> 07:33.487
BUT WHY ARE WE HIDING THIS
FROM BOYD?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.022
WELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WAIT SIX MONTHS

07:35.055 --> 07:38.025
BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE YOUR CHILD
TO SOMEONE YOU'RE DATING.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.028
I DON'T THINK THAT APPLIES IF
YOU'RE DATING THE KID'S FATHER.

07:41.061 --> 07:45.265
WE HAVE MET, KRISTIN.
WE SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF.

07:45.298 --> 07:49.002
I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO GET
HIS HOPES UP IN--IN CASE...

07:49.036 --> 07:53.040
IN CASE WHAT? KRIS, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE. I'M ALL IN.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.942
AND I AM TOTALLY
READY TO TELL BOYD.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.678
OH, YOU'RE GONNA TELL HIM.
I KNEW THIS DAY WAS COMING.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.481
WHEN DO YOU START
TAKING THE HORMONES, NANCY?

08:02.916 --> 08:06.620
AND I'M THE ONE
YOU'RE HIDING FROM BOYD?

08:06.654 --> 08:07.888
(Kristin) RYAN, WAIT UP.
(door closes)

08:07.921 --> 08:09.857
HEY, MANDY, COME OUT HERE.
I WANNA ASK YOU SOMETHIN'.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.462
YOU SUMMONED ME, PAPA?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.231
ACTING LIKE YOU'RE IN "YENTL"
IS NOT GONNA HELP.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.200
SIT DOWN OVER HERE.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.835
WHERE DID YOU SNEAK OUT
AND GO LAST NIGHT?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.571
OH, I ALREADY
TOLD MOM WHERE I WAS.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.973
WITH KYLE.
YOU WERE WITH KYLE, RIGHT?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.676
YEAH. FOR A WHILE.
BUT... OKAY,

08:28.709 --> 08:30.243
THEN I HAD TO GO
GET MY BRUNO MARS ON,

08:30.277 --> 08:32.012
SO I WENT OUT DANCING
WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.547
GIRLFRIENDS?

08:33.581 --> 08:36.383
YEAH, AND MY GAYS.
THEY'RE BETTER DANCERS.

08:36.416 --> 08:39.219
IT'S FUNNY. KYLE THINKS
YOU'RE OUT WITH ANOTHER DUDE,

08:39.252 --> 08:40.821
THE KIND THAT CAN'T DANCE,

08:40.854 --> 08:42.089
THE KIND OF GUY
THAT ONLY WANTS

08:42.122 --> 08:44.424
THREE OR FOUR
THINGS FROM A GIRL.
WAIT.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.259
YOU SAID SOMETHING TO HIM?

08:46.293 --> 08:48.395
HE BROUGHT IT UP.
SO KYLE KNOWS
THAT I LIED TO HIM?

08:48.428 --> 08:49.730
DAD, HE'S GONNA FREAK OUT.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.665
HE'S SO INTO THIS WHOLE,
LIKE, TELLING-THE-TRUTH THING.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.366
THANKS A LOT FOR BUTTING IN!

08:53.400 --> 08:56.403
YOU PROBABLY JUST DESTROYED
MY ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP!

08:56.436 --> 08:59.072
HEY, IS BLANCA
COMING TOMORROW?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.273
WHY?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.909
'CAUSE I NEED SOMEONE
TO HELP ME CLEAN UP

09:01.942 --> 09:05.112
THIS LOAD OF CRAP
SHE JUST LEFT HERE.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.583
SO MANDY LIED
ABOUT GOING DANCING?

09:09.617 --> 09:12.853
OH, YEAH. I KNOW SHE'S LYING
TO ME WHEN SHE CALLS ME "PAPA."

09:12.886 --> 09:14.955
HONEY, SHE CALLS YOU "PAPA"
ALL THE TIME.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.458
I KNOW.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.927
SHE JUST CREATED
ALL THIS DRAMA

09:19.960 --> 09:21.729
SO I WOULDN'T COME DOWN HARD
ON HER AND KYLE

09:21.762 --> 09:24.264
FOR STAYING OUT
TILL 3:00 A.M.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.600
IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF CLEVER.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.401
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT WASN'T KYLE'S IDEA?

09:28.435 --> 09:31.304
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF CLEVER.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.642
(laughs) WOW. SO MANDY IS
THE BRAINS OF THEIR OUTFIT?

09:34.675 --> 09:37.544
YEAH. THERE'S A FIRST.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.713
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HONEY, LET'S
NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.115
I-I REALLY DON'T THINK
THEY'VE DONE ALL THAT MUCH YET.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.051
THESE DAYS, WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN, "ALL THAT MUCH"?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.619
SECOND BASE? THIRD BASE?

09:45.653 --> 09:46.754
WELL, YOU KNOW THEY ALREADY
WENT TO FIRST BASE.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.656
I MEAN, THEY'RE
HOLDING HANDS, RIGHT?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.593
UH, FI--HOLDING HANDS?
THAT'S NOT A BASE.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.629
THAT'S NOT EVEN IN THE STADIUM.
HOLDING HANDS.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.397
WHAT--
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST BASE?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.767
FIRST BASE IS KISSING
WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED.
MM-HMM.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.769
HERS WERE.
MINE WERE WIDE OPEN.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.104
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
A GIRL WAS KISSING ME.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.807
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT KISSING WAS SECOND BASE,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.809
AND THIRD BASE WAS TONGUE.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.143
WELL, YOUR BOYFRIENDS
MUST HAVE BEEN EXCITED

10:10.177 --> 10:12.612
WHEN THEY GOT TO,
WHAT, EIGHTH BASE?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.951
IT'S GENIUS.
HE THINKS HE BROKE US UP.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.187
NOW HE WON'T BE ABLE
TO MURDER EITHER OF US

10:20.220 --> 10:21.822
FOR ME BEING OUT
PAST CURFEW.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.257
MANDY, I HATED
LYING TO YOUR FATHER.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.293
MADE ME FEEL SICK
TO MY STOMACH.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.828
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE TIME
I ATE THAT HAM

10:27.861 --> 10:29.797
I FOUND ON THE FLOOR
OF MY VAN?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.298
(laughs)

10:31.331 --> 10:34.101
WELL, I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL
ALL BETTER ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.269
YOU, UM,
YOU STILL HAVE THAT COUPON

10:36.303 --> 10:38.471
FOR THE IMPERIAL PARK HOTEL?

10:38.505 --> 10:40.173
YEAH. YEAH, WE HAVE TO
USE IT BY SATURDAY.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.608
OH, WE ARE GOING
TO USE IT.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.945
SEE, I'M GOING TO BE
SO UNHAPPY AND HEARTBROKEN

10:44.978 --> 10:47.681
THAT I'M DEFINITELY GONNA
NEED A SLEEPOVER ON FRIDAY

10:47.715 --> 10:49.282
AT CHLOE'S HOUSE.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.818
WAIT, SO YOU'RE
TELLING YOUR PARENTS

10:50.851 --> 10:53.020
YOU'RE GOING TO
A SLEEPOVER AT A FRIEND'S,

10:53.053 --> 10:54.722
BUT YOU'RE REALLY
MEETING UP WITH A GUY?

10:54.755 --> 10:55.823
Mm-hmm.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.991
(laughing) HOW DO YOU
COME UP WITH THIS STUFF?

10:58.025 --> 10:59.760
(laughs)

11:01.061 --> 11:02.696
OH, OKAY. I-I HAVE TO GO.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.664
THERE'S A SNAKE
CRAWLING UP MY LEG.

11:05.733 --> 11:06.734
OH, MY GOD, KYLE.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.969
SAVE THAT KIND OF TALK
FOR FRIDAY. (giggles)

11:09.002 --> 11:11.038
(phone snaps shut)

11:11.071 --> 11:13.340
WELL, WELL, WELL.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.478
THE IMPERIAL PARK HOTEL, HUH?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.914
DENVER'S NUMBER ONE
BAR MITZVAH VENUE.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.750
SWANKY.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.984
(clears throat)

11:24.017 --> 11:25.919
I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.888
BAR MITZVAH?
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL RITUAL

11:27.921 --> 11:29.823
WHERE A BOY BECOMES A MAN.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.893
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'LL BE
DOING TO KYLE FRIDAY NIGHT.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.829
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.831
I GET KISSING AND ALL THAT.

11:37.865 --> 11:42.269
BUT WHY THE BIG RUSH
TO HOOK UP WITH KYLE, YOU KNOW?

11:42.302 --> 11:43.403
IN THAT WAY?

11:43.436 --> 11:45.538
BIG RUSH?

11:45.572 --> 11:48.541
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.779
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE SEEN YOU
THROW YOURSELF AT A LOT OF GUYS,

11:51.812 --> 11:54.181
AND FOR SOME REASON,
IT NEVER WORKS OUT.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.549
WELL, MAYBE THEY WERE
THE WRONG GUYS.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.920
OR DID YOU JUST GET BORED WITH
THEM BECAUSE YOU MOVE TOO FAST?

11:59.953 --> 12:05.192
OR THEY GOT BORED WITH YOU
FOR THE SAME REASON?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.260
KYLE ISN'T LIKE THOSE GUYS.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.796
YEAH. (sighs)

12:08.829 --> 12:09.797
I THOUGHT MAYBE
HE WAS ONE GUY

12:09.830 --> 12:11.965
WHO WOULD LIKE YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE.

12:11.999 --> 12:15.102
NOT FOR WHAT YOU THINK
ALL GUYS WANT.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.870
EVE...

12:16.904 --> 12:20.573
DON'T WORRY.
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.275
I'M NOT GONNA TELL
MOM AND DAD.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.211
THANK YOU.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.714
FRIDAY NIGHT.
THE IMPERIAL PARK HOTEL.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.149
I DON'T HAVE
A ROOM NUMBER YET,

12:29.182 --> 12:30.818
BUT I CAN GET IT.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.821
THE IMPERIAL PARK HOTEL?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.722
DIDN'T THAT USED TO
JUST BE THE PARK HOTEL?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.557
RIGHT. THEN THEY ADDED
A DOG TRACK NEXT DOOR,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.492
AND THEY'RE FEELING
PRETTY HIGH ON THEMSELVES.
OH.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.929
ALL RIGHT, KIDDO.
THANKS FOR THE INTEL.

12:41.962 --> 12:42.930
YEAH.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.065
YOU GOT ANYTHING
ON ANYBODY ELSE?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.900
MAYBE.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.837
(lowered voice) NOTHING I CAN
DISCUSS IN PRESENT COMPANY.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.604
(scoffs) HEY!

12:53.606 --> 12:56.343
BUY YOURSELF
A BAR OF CHOCOLATE.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.945
(clicks tongue)

13:00.280 --> 13:02.182
(switch clicks)
WELL, ACCORDING
TO YOUR INFORMANT,

13:02.215 --> 13:03.951
THEY HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET...

13:03.984 --> 13:06.987
UNTIL FRIDAY...
IN A HOTEL.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.156
(sighs) BY A DOG TRACK.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.792
WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW
IT'LL BE SPECIAL.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.295
COME ON, HONEY.
I KNOW THE LOCATION.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.430
I CAN SHUT THIS OPERATION DOWN
JUST LIKE THAT.
(snaps fingers)

13:17.464 --> 13:19.199
OH, MIKE,
WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.968
IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THERE,
IT'LL HAPPEN SOMEWHERE ELSE.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.870
LOOK, KYLE HASN'T
CONNECTED THE DOTS,

13:22.903 --> 13:25.605
BUT THE BOY
DOES DRIVE A VAN.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.108
LISTEN, WE LOST THIS BATTLE
WITH KRISTIN,

13:28.141 --> 13:30.343
AND I'M NOT ABOUT READY TO
THROW IN THE TOWEL WITH MANDY,

13:30.377 --> 13:31.979
OR FOR EVE, FOR THAT MATTER.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.213
I KNOW.
YEAH, EVE'S SISTERS

13:33.246 --> 13:34.848
HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN
STELLAR ROLE MODELS.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.284
AND NEITHER
HAS THEIR MOTHER.
HEY!

13:37.317 --> 13:40.287
LISTEN, LOOK AT THESE GLAMOUR
MAGAZINES FLOATING AROUND.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.555
WHAT KIND OF IMAGE
IS THIS FOR EVE?

13:42.589 --> 13:43.991
FROM THE TIME THEY GET UP,

13:44.024 --> 13:45.658
THEY'RE BOMBARDED
WITH SEXY IMAGES.
(mutters)

13:45.692 --> 13:47.460
MAGAZINES, MOVIES,
BILLBOARDS.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.162
THIS MORNING,
I'M HAVING PANCAKES--

13:49.196 --> 13:51.198
THE SYRUP BOTTLE LADY?
YEAH?

13:51.231 --> 13:52.966
I THINK THEY BUMPED HER UP
A CUP SIZE.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.003
I DON'T MIND THAT,
BECAUSE I GET MORE SYRUP.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.905
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGE.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.740
THE WHOLE WORLD IS TELLING
OUR DAUGHTERS THEY'RE NOTHING

14:00.773 --> 14:03.476
UNLESS THEY LOOK
AND ACT LIKE A PORN STAR.
(switch clicks)

14:03.510 --> 14:06.713
LIKE THE VIXEN
ON THE SYRUP BOTTLE.
OH...

14:06.746 --> 14:08.882
IT'S--IT'S A WAR.
(switch clicks)

14:08.916 --> 14:10.483
WE MAY NOT WIN IT,

14:10.517 --> 14:13.586
BUT WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE LINE
WITH MANDY AND KYLE.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.821
OH, WHAT YOU GONNA DO,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.823
CALL IN A DRONE STRIKE
ON YOUR DAUGHTER?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.859
NO. IT'S CALLED PSY-OPS--
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE.
MM. MM-HMM.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.262
AND LUCKILY,
ONE OF OUR OPPONENTS

14:22.295 --> 14:25.999
IS WEAK, FEMININE,
AND EASILY MANIPULATED.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.901
HEY. YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME, MR. B.?

14:27.935 --> 14:30.003
YEAH. COME ON IN. SIT DOWN.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.906
LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND MANDY.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.841
SHE SAYS YOU BROKE UP.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.078
NOTHING WORSE THAN...
BEING LIED TO.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.114
YEAH. I'M IN
A LOT OF PAIN.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.383
WELL, LISTEN, I WANT
TO TRY TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.352
THOUGHT MAYBE TONIGHT
I'D, UH,

14:45.385 --> 14:48.088
TAKE YOU TO, UH,
THE DOG TRACK.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.192
TONIGHT? I CAN'T.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.962
I HAVE A SLEEPOVER
AT MY FRIEND CHLOE'S HOUSE.

15:00.968 --> 15:04.471
I MEAN, MY FRIEND...
KHLOE'S HOUSE.

15:04.504 --> 15:08.475
"KHLOE" WITH A "K"--
THAT'S HOW GUYS SPELL IT.

15:08.508 --> 15:12.745
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY DESERVE
A NIGHT OUT WITH YOUR BUDDIES.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.281
'CAUSE YOU'RE AN HONORABLE GUY.
YOU REALLY ARE.

15:14.314 --> 15:18.618
THAT'S WHY I THINK OF YOU
LIKE A... A SON.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.388
(sighs) A SON?
YEAH.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.991
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME,
SIR.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.426
AND ALSO MAKES MANDY
MY SISTER.

15:29.129 --> 15:33.233
WHICH IS UNCOMFORTABLE
AND CONFUSING.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.902
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU EVER
HAVE CONFUSING THOUGHTS,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.405
IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL
TO ASK YOURSELF,

15:38.438 --> 15:41.474
"WHAT WOULD MR. B.
WANT ME TO DO?"

15:41.508 --> 15:43.510
OH.
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.745
USUALLY WHEN I TALK
TO MYSELF, IT'S LIKE,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.514
"HEY, KYLE, HOW'S IT GOING?"

15:47.547 --> 15:49.949
"FINE."

15:49.983 --> 15:52.152
"WORKING HARD,
OR HARDLY WORKING?"

15:55.555 --> 15:58.625
I REALLY GIVE MYSELF
THE BUSINESS.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.962
SO...

16:02.996 --> 16:03.963
ASK YOURSELF SOMETIMES,

16:03.997 --> 16:05.865
"WHAT WOULD MR. B.
WANT ME TO DO?"

16:05.898 --> 16:09.636
LIKE RIGHT NOW.
LOOK AT ME AND SAY TO YOURSELF,

16:09.669 --> 16:12.972
"WHAT DO YOU THINK MR. B.
WANTS ME TO DO RIGHT NOW?"

16:13.006 --> 16:15.008
DON'T LET IT HIT ME
IN THE ASS ON THE WAY OUT.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.852
HEY, MAMA.
I'LL BE AT RYAN'S.

16:25.885 --> 16:29.189
I AM NOT GOING OUT THERE
TO HELP YOU PUSH THAT CAR AGAIN.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.824
I ALREADY TOOK MY BRA OFF.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.663
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WOULD YOU MIND,
UH, PUTTING BOYD TO BED FOR ME?

16:36.696 --> 16:39.399
(sighs) YOU KNOW WHAT, KRISTIN?
ACTUALLY, I WOULD MIND.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.369
HONEY, I AM NOT
COVERING FOR YOU ANYMORE

16:42.402 --> 16:44.837
WITH DAD OR WITH BOYD.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.473
I MEAN, HONEY, WHY--
WHY ARE WE PRETENDING

16:46.506 --> 16:48.508
THAT YOU AND RYAN
AREN'T A COUPLE?

16:48.541 --> 16:51.911
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST NOT READY
TO TELL BOYD.
(sighs)

16:51.944 --> 16:53.513
WHY DO YOU AND RYAN HAVE
TO DO EVERYTHING BACKWARDS?

16:53.546 --> 16:55.182
YOU HAVE A KID,
THEN YOU DATE,

16:55.215 --> 16:58.585
THEN YOU MAKE INTRODUCTIONS.
(sighs)

16:58.618 --> 17:01.754
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I WOULD EVEN BEGIN

17:01.788 --> 17:03.923
TO EXPLAIN MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH RYAN TO BOYD.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.092
WELL, HOW ABOUT
THE TRUTH?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.260
FIGURE IT OUT
AND EXPLAIN IT TO YOUR SON.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.330
JUST LEAVE OUT THE GORY DETAILS
THAT HE DOESN'T NEED TO HEAR.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.365
LOOK, HONEY, EVERY PARENT
NEEDS TO FIND WAYS

17:12.399 --> 17:14.401
TO HIDE THEIR SEX LIVES
FROM THEIR KIDS.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.703
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
YOUR DAD'S UPSTAIRS,

17:16.736 --> 17:19.072
AND WE HAVE TO GO OVER
THE WATER BILL.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.121
(door opens)
AAH!

17:34.154 --> 17:36.055
THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!
(door closes)

17:36.089 --> 17:37.557
IT'S AN EXECUTIVE SUITE.
OOH.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.959
SO IF ANYBODY ASKS,
WE'RE HERE ON BUSINESS.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.295
HEY, WE GOT THE WHOLE NIGHT.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.397
MY PARENTS
ARE TOTALLY FOOLED.
YEAH.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.433
I FEEL SORT OF BAD
ABOUT HOW I TREATED YOUR DAD.

17:46.466 --> 17:50.537
NOW HE'S OVER THERE AT THAT
DOG TRACK ALL BY HIMSELF.

17:50.570 --> 17:55.608
FORGET ABOUT HIM.
CONCENTRATE ON ME.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.644
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO CONCENTRATE ON FIRST.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.479
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO NOW?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.481
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO I WANNA DO?

18:01.514 --> 18:05.084
WHAT WOULD MR. B.
WANT YOU TO DO?

18:10.022 --> 18:11.891
NOT THIS.
WHAT?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.127
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT. UH...

18:14.161 --> 18:16.429
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY IS...

18:16.463 --> 18:18.298
YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR THIS.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.433
YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR THIS.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.270
UH... NO. THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.839
YOU COULD DO SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THIS GUY.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.108
THAT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF HURTFUL.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.110
WHAT DID I SAY?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.779
OH, NO, NO. NOT YOU.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.515
KYLE, ARE YOU...
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.984
NO. MY STOMACH
HAS THE HAM FLOPS,

18:38.017 --> 18:42.088
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY HEAD.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.693
ARE YOU HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT TONIGHT?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.861
KIND OF.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.431
IS IT ME?
NO. NO, NO.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.300
YOU'RE AMAZING.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.469
IT'S JUST I... I KNOW
THAT WHEN I RUSH

18:56.503 --> 18:58.305
INTO THE PHYSICAL STUFF
TOO FAST,

18:58.338 --> 19:00.640
THAT BECOMES ALL THERE IS
IN THE RELATIONSHIP,

19:00.673 --> 19:04.844
AND YOU STOP TRYING TO GET TO
KNOW EACH OTHER IN OTHER WAYS.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.480
OH.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.683
I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

19:10.717 --> 19:14.020
I... MIGHT BE A LITTLE FAST

19:14.053 --> 19:16.389
TO JUMP INTO PHYSICAL STUFF.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.824
I THINK THAT'S 'CAUSE I KNOW

19:17.857 --> 19:20.560
I'M JUST REALLY, REALLY
GOOD AT IT.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.130
YEAH.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.466
I FIGURED YOU WOULD BE.
(giggles)

19:26.499 --> 19:27.800
BUT...

19:27.834 --> 19:30.069
THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER STUFF
WE COULD DO AT THIS HOTEL.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.573
SAW A PRETTY SWEET
BAR MITZVAH DOWNSTAIRS.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.208
I THINK THEY HAVE KARAOKE.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.843
YOU WANNA GO?
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

19:36.876 --> 19:37.944
GOOD.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.355
YOU ARE A GOOD GUY.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.689
LET'S GO.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.659
UH, WELL, NOW I-I CAN'T.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.926
WHY?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.695
UH, I MEAN, I'M A GOOD GUY,

19:55.728 --> 19:58.097
BUT I'M STILL A GUY.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.666
OH.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.000
I'M JUST GONNA SIT HERE
FOR A MINUTE

20:01.033 --> 20:03.069
AND THINK ABOUT YOUR DAD.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.738
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS.
(giggles)

20:05.772 --> 20:09.108
(door closes)

20:09.141 --> 20:11.911
YOU ARE A GOOD GUY, KYLE.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.946
OKAY. YEAH, THAT DID IT.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.823
(knock on door)

20:29.128 --> 20:30.263
HEY.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.931
AW.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.034
AND, HEY!

20:35.067 --> 20:38.805
(laughs)
WH-WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE.

20:38.838 --> 20:39.972
I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GONNA SEE
BOTH OF YOU TONIGHT.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.474
COME HERE, BOYD.
GIVE ME A HUG.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.976
(whispers)
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.745
HANG--HANG ON, RYAN.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.614
OKAY, BEFORE
WE GO ANY FURTHER,

20:47.647 --> 20:50.082
I WOULD LIKE TO FORMALLY
INTRODUCE YOU

20:50.116 --> 20:52.685
TO MY SON BOYD.
(door closes)

20:54.321 --> 20:56.423
BOYD, THIS IS
MOMMY'S NEW BOYFRIEND,

20:56.456 --> 20:58.157
DADDY.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.594
I DON'T GET IT.

21:01.628 --> 21:05.097
WELL, WHAT SHE MEANS
IS THAT MOMMY AND DADDY

21:05.131 --> 21:07.099
ARE GONNA BE HANGING
AROUND EACH OTHER MORE.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.102
BUT LIKE A ROMANTIC COUPLE.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.004
OH, YOU MEAN KISSING?

21:12.038 --> 21:15.007
HOPEFULLY.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.943
HEY, CAN WE WATCH A MOVIE?

21:16.976 --> 21:20.112
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.914
I'LL PUT ON
A NICE, LONG MOVIE

21:21.948 --> 21:25.251
WHILE MOMMY AND DADDY
GO TIDY UP THE BEDROOM.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.154
I GUESS.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.189
THANK YOU.
