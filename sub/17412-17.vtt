00:03.410 --> 00:04.190
[video game tones]

00:04.240 --> 00:07.460
Laurie, Andy, Fetus.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.420
Thank you for joining me
here today

00:09.460 --> 00:12.420
in this calm,
meditative space.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.900
I've gathered you here
because I think it's--

00:14.940 --> 00:18.380
Can you stop playing Bejeweled
for ten seconds?

00:18.430 --> 00:20.090
There's no--there's no
wrong way to meditate.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.080
- She told me that.
- Give me your phone.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.780
Well, there sort of is.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.260
- Give me this.
- What? Don't take my phone.

00:24.300 --> 00:25.390
- Give me this.
- I'm not 12 years old.

00:25.430 --> 00:27.090
- You can't take it.
- Oh, oh, oh.

00:27.130 --> 00:28.910
See, I think this is actually
going to be a really good time

00:28.960 --> 00:31.350
to finalize the plans
for your babymoon

00:31.400 --> 00:34.150
'cause I think the babymoon
is really going to ease

00:34.180 --> 00:37.750
the considerable tension
that I feel

00:37.790 --> 00:39.180
between the two of you.

00:39.230 --> 00:41.360
Perhaps even eliminate it.
What--what ideas--

00:41.410 --> 00:44.110
What plan have you come up with?
Have you decided?

00:44.150 --> 00:46.500
We have.
We're having a staycation.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.020
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.630
We're going to ship the kids
off to my folks,

00:49.670 --> 00:51.680
order some salads in,
and some spa treatments.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.680
Salads?

00:52.720 --> 00:55.330
And for 48 glorious hours,

00:55.380 --> 00:56.650
that house will be
ours again.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.420
Well, that sounds lovely,
doesn't it?

00:59.470 --> 01:00.860
Wha--what about
my plan though?

01:00.900 --> 01:02.770
Because, look, you get
free buffet breakfast

01:02.820 --> 01:03.770
in a superior room.

01:03.820 --> 01:05.120
Okay, an expired Groupon

01:05.170 --> 01:07.080
to the MGM Grand is not
a plan, Andy.

01:07.130 --> 01:09.740
I'm not hauling my pregnant ass
up and down some Vegas casino.

01:09.780 --> 01:12.300
Vegas! Vegas!
Who said Vegas?

01:12.350 --> 01:14.570
Honestly, the airport
is fogged in right now,

01:14.610 --> 01:15.740
but flights are going
in about an hour.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.050
We can go
out of Oakland.

01:17.090 --> 01:19.220
False alarm, Will.
No one's going to Vegas.

01:19.270 --> 01:21.310
Andy and Laurie are having
a babymoon staycation, Will.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.840
Stop making up words.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.400
Andy, are you really
going to let Laurie

01:24.450 --> 01:25.490
bully you out of a trip
to Vegas?

01:25.540 --> 01:27.100
- Come on.
- It's not--

01:27.150 --> 01:29.060
It's not bullying.
It's just--it's--

01:29.110 --> 01:30.640
That's right, Andy.
No, it's not.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.320
And you know what?
We just want to be alone

01:32.370 --> 01:33.800
in our house.

01:33.850 --> 01:37.810
Your house smells like poop
and feet and vomit.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.550
I am a professional doula,
and I am currently doulaing,

01:40.590 --> 01:42.030
- so could you please just--
- Oh, really?

01:42.070 --> 01:43.860
- Do you have a license?
- You can't institutionalize

01:43.900 --> 01:45.340
- healing, Will.
- Oh, really? What's a doctor?

01:45.380 --> 01:46.600
That's a different beast.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.950
Andy, let me ask you
something.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.560
If you're not
being bullied,

01:50.600 --> 01:52.300
why don't you have a say
in any of this?

01:52.350 --> 01:53.530
That's very true.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.430
Why don't I ever get a say
in our vacations?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.960
Let's see, um,
do the words

01:57.000 --> 01:58.740
"bicycle trip through Laos"
ring a bell?

01:58.790 --> 02:01.440
That was 12 years ago!
And we got on the news.

02:01.490 --> 02:02.500
We got SARS!

02:02.530 --> 02:04.620
The is the considerable
tension

02:04.660 --> 02:06.400
I was talking about
eliminating.

02:06.450 --> 02:09.320
Andy, I am putting
my swollen foot down.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.840
- Staycation.
- House arrest.

02:11.890 --> 02:15.060
Tension elimination.

02:15.110 --> 02:18.280
You know what?

02:18.330 --> 02:20.240
I got a foot too.

02:20.290 --> 02:22.070
My foot is going
to Vegas.

02:24.250 --> 02:25.810
Okay, fine.
Go to Vegas.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.420
That's fine.
I'm gonna be here

02:27.470 --> 02:29.950
on my staycation
with Fiona.

02:29.990 --> 02:31.080
Thank you, Will.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.520
In all my years--months,

02:33.560 --> 02:34.600
as an unlicensed healer,
I've never been--

02:34.650 --> 02:37.080
Hold on one second,
someone's talking.

02:37.130 --> 02:39.350
You put the reservation
under Will Freeman,

02:39.390 --> 02:41.480
and I'll take a double bed
by the elevator

02:41.530 --> 02:42.930
per usual.
Is this Stephanie?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.480
Here we go.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.440
"Sharcus"?

03:19.480 --> 03:20.650
It's our couples name.

03:20.690 --> 03:23.520
You know, Shea plus Marcus...
Sharcus.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.870
You know, I already did
most of the heavy lifting,

03:25.920 --> 03:27.220
but I thought, you know,
you know,

03:27.270 --> 03:29.530
maybe we could embroider
some flourishes together.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.050
Sorry, Marcus.
I don't have time.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.620
I have to read this book.
For school.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.110
Great idea.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.540
You know, I was gonna suggest
a couple of study sessions

03:38.580 --> 03:40.280
but I didn't want things
to move too fast.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.630
Uh, what's the subject?

03:45.720 --> 03:48.110
Um, this isn't
a school book.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.290
Forget it.
You wouldn't understand.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.720
"Wouldn't understand"?

03:51.770 --> 03:54.250
I read above the 12th grade
reading level.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.470
You know, I just finished Ladies of Loom:

03:56.510 --> 03:59.910
A Complete History of Wool and the Women Who Shaped It.

03:59.950 --> 04:01.170
And you know,
it was actually--

04:01.210 --> 04:02.520
It's not that kind
of book.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.130
It's about
adult relationships.

04:04.170 --> 04:08.610
You wouldn't be able
to handle it, so stop asking.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.670
Come on, Julio,
work the instep.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.450

for two.

Ooooh,
that's the sweet spot.

04:24.580 --> 04:27.150
Laurie, may I share something
with you?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.160
If it's about anything other
than this man's hands

04:29.200 --> 04:30.590
on my feet, then no.

04:30.630 --> 04:32.110
I mean, as your friend,

04:32.160 --> 04:35.510
I would like to thank you
for this serene experience.

04:35.550 --> 04:37.470
But as your doula,
I do feel a bit guilty

04:37.510 --> 04:38.820
about taking Andy's place.

04:38.860 --> 04:43.250
Shh!

04:43.300 --> 04:45.650
You see, I do think
it should be Andy

04:45.690 --> 04:48.560
experiencing the joys
of Julio's hands.

04:48.610 --> 04:50.350
Andy hates massages.

04:50.390 --> 04:54.610
He had a bad experience
falling asleep at the YMCA.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.490
Come on, Julio,
we're not in an oil drought.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.360
Slather it on.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.400
All right, baby, I got the
whole itinerary planned out.

05:02.450 --> 05:04.320
Day one:
poker, whiskey, steak.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.500
Day two:
poker, whiskey, steak.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.760
Am I missing anything?

05:07.800 --> 05:09.540
- The Angry Rabbit.
- The Angry Rabbit?

05:09.590 --> 05:11.590
Is that an awesome meal,
or a terrible strip club?

05:11.630 --> 05:13.070
No, it is--

05:13.110 --> 05:14.980
What are we doing?
No, we're not doing that.

05:15.030 --> 05:16.980
All right, let's go grab
a couple of single malts

05:17.030 --> 05:19.550
and hit the tables.
[clapping]

05:19.600 --> 05:21.380
No.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.380
What do you mean "no"?

05:22.430 --> 05:24.570
No.
I don't want to do that.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.470
I mean, I just stared down
a Laurie so full of hormones

05:27.520 --> 05:29.300
she bit the head
off her toothbrush.

05:29.350 --> 05:31.440
I'm not gonna be
controlled anymore.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.390
Not by her,
and--and not by you.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.090
I don't control you.
Come on.

05:35.130 --> 05:36.390
- Yes, you do.
- Let's go.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.570
Every single time
we go to Vegas

05:38.620 --> 05:39.930
we follow Will's plan.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.620
We play Will's games,
and we drink Will's drinks.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.400
Poker and whiskey
aren't Will's plan,

05:44.450 --> 05:46.320
they're God's plan.

05:47.710 --> 05:50.190
This time we're following
Andy's plan.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.250
Hey, bartender,
Two Kahlua Mudslides.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.280
Extra whipped cream.

06:00.850 --> 06:03.380
This is so sick.

06:03.420 --> 06:06.860
I always dreamt about
hanging out in The Angry Rabbit.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.210
It's where all the masters
hang out.

- This place is not cool, dude.

Ocean 0.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.660
Oh, my God.
Hey, psst.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.530
If that's who I think it is,
we gotta say hi.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.670
- We--
- Just--

06:29.710 --> 06:31.490
I prefer not to speak
to anyone, Andy.

06:31.540 --> 06:32.930
Oh, my God.
It's Andini.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.150
And if anybody asks,
you are my assistant.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.410
Oh, no one's going
to ask, dude.

06:37.460 --> 06:41.200
Excuse me. Hi.
Sir, um,

06:41.240 --> 06:44.420
Sorry to bother you,
but are you Dennis the Deceiver?

06:44.460 --> 06:46.550
I am what I am.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.900
Or am I?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.600
Just like in your show.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.380
As a young illusionist,
I always dreamed about

06:53.430 --> 06:55.650
going to your elite
College of Magic.

06:55.690 --> 06:58.560
Oh, you're an alumnus?
Why didn't you say so?

06:58.610 --> 06:59.560
Sit down, kid.
Give him a drink.

06:59.610 --> 07:02.350
No, I'm not.
Not an alumnus.

07:02.390 --> 07:04.610
I-I applied.
I just didn't get in.

07:04.660 --> 07:07.050
Andy, who doesn't get in
to magic school?

07:07.090 --> 07:08.970
A lot of people.
It's very competitive.

07:09.010 --> 07:10.710
Competitive?
It was magic school, kid,

07:10.750 --> 07:12.230
not Dartmouth.

07:12.270 --> 07:15.490
We accepted anybody
whose tuition check cleared.

07:15.540 --> 07:16.800
That's not true
because

07:16.840 --> 07:18.630
I actually got
a rejection letter.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.240
My wife showed it to me.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.720
I'll never forget the feeling
when I opened it.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.720
We didn't have
rejection letters.

07:29.290 --> 07:31.200
Oh, my God.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.160
She faked it.

07:33.210 --> 07:34.820
Laurie faked the letter.

07:34.860 --> 07:37.600
She denied my dream
of pursuing the cape,

07:37.650 --> 07:39.040
and she took it away,

07:39.080 --> 07:42.480
just like she takes
everything away from me.

07:42.520 --> 07:47.480
Buddy, maybe you'd feel
better anywhere else than here.

07:47.530 --> 07:48.610
You okay, son?

07:48.660 --> 07:50.490
No.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.620
I'm better than okay.
[chuckles]

07:54.660 --> 07:58.230
Because Laurie's not gonna
control me anymore, Dennis.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.670
I'm free.

07:59.710 --> 08:04.540
Bartender, a round of Mudslides
for all free men!

08:04.590 --> 08:05.720
I'm not a free man.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.330
I'll take a scotch
in a to-go cup.

08:11.940 --> 08:15.380
Oof. This book is so much better
than married life.

08:15.420 --> 08:16.990
Andy's idea of
erotic adventure

08:17.030 --> 08:19.430
is sex with the TV off.

08:19.470 --> 08:22.730
Laurie, I-I think you might
have missed the intent

08:22.780 --> 08:23.740
of the babymoon.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.000
What are you talking about?

08:25.040 --> 08:26.560
This is the best vacation
I've ever had.

08:26.610 --> 08:29.610
Maybe for you, but do you
really think eyebrow sculpting

08:29.660 --> 08:31.360
is Andy's idea
of a good time?

08:31.400 --> 08:33.180
[sighs]
Okay, maybe the staycation

08:33.220 --> 08:35.010
is a little me-focused,
but so what?

08:35.050 --> 08:36.440
I mean, I'm the one
having the damn baby.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.620
Shh!
It's the third trimester.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.540
- Fetus has ears.
- If it's anything like

08:40.580 --> 08:42.540
my other three children,
it's not listening.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.930
I have to be stuck
in the office every day

08:44.980 --> 08:47.330

faking his vasectomy.

08:51.630 --> 08:54.680
so maybe the idea of staying
home for the weekend

08:54.720 --> 08:57.990
was like the idea of you staying
at the office all weekend.

but he's your idiot.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.470

You're having
a lovely new baby.

Andy, come on.
All right.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.410
Let's say good-bye
to Gandalf

09:25.450 --> 09:27.280

and let's go.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.580
We're leaving.
Come on.

I'm not going back to the hotel,

From now on,
The Angry Rabbit is my home.

talking about

and joining the circus.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.680

- Andy is dead.

With a little skill
and a lot of compassion,

10:06.230 --> 10:09.450
I've mended the rift
between Andy and Laurie.

10:09.490 --> 10:11.840
And actually, we're coming
to Vegas to celebrate.

10:11.890 --> 10:14.410
So I can't wait to hear
what Andy has to say about that.

10:14.460 --> 10:16.340
Can you put him on?
Where is he?

so quick.

a mudslide with my hero,

for the new baby.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.530
I mean, Laurie's gonna
murder me.

11:31.580 --> 11:32.790
She's gonna murder me.
The only question is

11:32.840 --> 11:35.750
how is she going to do it?
Because she's smart.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.580
She'll make the whole thing
look like an accident.

let her take me on a boat.

a good time,

something to tell you.

I can fix this.

I may lose my girlfriend.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.910
Communication.
They're about communication.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.870
That's what they're about.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.100
That's right.
And good communication

18:40.140 --> 18:42.230
requires trust and honesty.

18:42.270 --> 18:44.620
You really care about Shea,
don't you?

18:44.660 --> 18:46.360
- Yeah.
- And you want to be around

18:46.400 --> 18:48.970
- for the new baby, right?
- What?

18:49.010 --> 18:50.840
- No, I mean, you know...
- [mouthing words]

18:50.880 --> 18:52.930
You need to have

18:52.970 --> 18:55.240
a calm, open,

18:55.280 --> 18:58.330
truthful conversation
where you talk,

18:58.370 --> 19:00.980
and more importantly,
you listen.

19:01.030 --> 19:03.910
Listening is so key, Fiona.
That's a great point.

19:03.940 --> 19:10.120
[mouthing words]

19:10.170 --> 19:13.000
Wait, um,
I can't hear anything.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.300
Wait. Am I going deaf?

19:15.340 --> 19:17.430
Oh, you think we got through
to them?

19:17.480 --> 19:19.960
Yeah, I think I got
through to them.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.610
Now everything's out
in the open,

19:21.650 --> 19:24.610
they can rebuild
from a place of honesty and--

19:26.180 --> 19:28.010
That might be a bit
of a journey.

19:29.010 --> 19:30.660
Ah, but they're already--

19:33.230 --> 19:35.230
Yeah, maybe give it
a week.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.320
Maybe longer.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.070
Shea, I really like
being your boyfriend.

19:44.110 --> 19:47.070
But if this is the kind of
adult relationship you want,

19:47.110 --> 19:48.640
then I am not ready.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.420
And frankly, is we're talking
about this stuff on page 148,

19:52.470 --> 19:55.170
probably never gonna
be ready.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.820
I'm not ready either.

19:56.860 --> 19:57.910
You're not?

19:57.950 --> 19:59.300
No.

19:59.340 --> 20:00.870
No, when you caught me
reading this,

20:00.910 --> 20:03.220
I was so embarrassed.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.610
So you--you don't want
to do the stuff in the book?

20:05.660 --> 20:08.710
No, no. Gross.
This book is crazy.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.970
Like what they did
in the gazebo?

20:11.010 --> 20:14.100
I know! And--and when they
were kissing with their tongues?

20:14.140 --> 20:15.360
Ugh. What is that, right?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.230
You mean French kissing?

20:17.280 --> 20:19.810
Uh, th--duh, you know.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.930
The book is set in Portugal

20:21.980 --> 20:23.120
so, you know, that's why
it threw me.

20:23.150 --> 20:27.630
Yeah.
It's set in Portugal.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.160
You're weird, Marcus.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.990
Yeah, but not like--
not like "gazebo weird."

20:34.070 --> 20:35.900
So this is
just temporary, right?

20:35.950 --> 20:37.600
Just a little, you know,
bump in the road

20:37.640 --> 20:38.900
before you're back
with Laurie?

20:38.950 --> 20:40.300
Dude, trust me.
You're not gonna notice

20:40.340 --> 20:43.340
I'm here.

20:43.390 --> 20:45.350
[Will]
I might notice a little bit.

20:45.390 --> 20:47.870
Well, come on.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.530
Looked like so much less
stuff in the storage locker.

20:50.570 --> 20:51.920
Dude, come on!

20:54.050 --> 20:55.230
[dog barking]
