WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:04.460
It is one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.

00:04.461 --> 00:07.548
JONATHAN YOUNG:
Hawaii is a utopian place.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.258
Some say Edenic.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.719
NARRATOR:
But could the Hawaiian Islands

00:11.720 --> 00:15.347
also be something
much, much more?

00:15.348 --> 00:19.308
A place that is not only
a destination for tourists,

00:19.309 --> 00:22.813
but for extraterrestrial
visitors?

00:22.814 --> 00:26.358
NICK POPE:
Hawaii seems to be at the center

00:26.359 --> 00:29.402
of a wave of UFO sightings.

00:29.403 --> 00:31.863
Wow, these don't look
like humans, do they?

00:31.864 --> 00:34.240
MICHAEL SALLA:
When I first saw that tiki,

00:34.241 --> 00:36.200
first thought
that came to my mind was,

00:36.201 --> 00:38.161
"That's a Grey
extraterrestrial."

00:38.162 --> 00:42.249
NARRATOR: Could Hawaii
be one of the hot spots

00:42.250 --> 00:44.918
of alien activity on our planet?

00:49.131 --> 00:51.090
And could it serve as a portal

00:51.091 --> 00:54.761
that not only attracts beings
from other worlds to us,

00:54.762 --> 00:57.389
but could,
one day, offer mankind

00:57.390 --> 01:00.600
a gateway to other worlds?

01:00.601 --> 01:03.770
SALLA: Hawaii is the place where
extraterrestrials travel through

01:03.771 --> 01:07.733
to go to other places
throughout the entire planet.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.488
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:12.489 --> 01:15.282
in the universe.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.286
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:19.787 --> 01:21.997
It demands
we question everything

01:21.998 --> 01:24.333
we have ever been taught.

01:24.334 --> 01:28.544
The evidence is all around us.

01:28.545 --> 01:32.090
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.759
We are not alone.

01:34.760 --> 01:38.264
We have never <i> been</i> alone.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.691
Hawaii.

01:49.692 --> 01:55.197
To visitors and tourists,
it is a paradise on Earth,

01:55.198 --> 02:00.786
a land of cascading waterfalls,
breathtaking scenery,

02:00.787 --> 02:03.498
and captivating volcanoes.

02:10.044 --> 02:12.881
But this tropical island chain

02:12.882 --> 02:17.176
is not merely a beautiful
and romantic travel destination.

02:17.177 --> 02:19.263
To the people
that have inhabited

02:19.264 --> 02:21.097
this land for centuries,

02:21.098 --> 02:25.060
and who carry with them the
traditions of their ancestors,

02:25.061 --> 02:28.604
Hawaii is something
very different.

02:28.605 --> 02:32.234
For them, it is the place
where beings from the sky

02:32.235 --> 02:35.404
came to Earth centuries ago.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.614
And a place where many,

02:37.615 --> 02:41.075
like tribal elder
Kimokeo Kapahulehua,

02:41.076 --> 02:45.998
believe these so-called sky
people are destined to return.

03:10.899 --> 03:15.776
NARRATOR: Is it possible that the
ancient stories of the native Hawaiians

03:15.777 --> 03:19.197
are, in fact,
evidence of early human contact

03:19.198 --> 03:21.616
with extraterrestrials?

03:21.617 --> 03:25.245
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

03:25.246 --> 03:28.039
the answer is yes.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.292
And they believe
one of the reasons

03:30.293 --> 03:33.961
that extraterrestrial visitors
chose the Hawaiian Islands

03:33.962 --> 03:37.257
as a destination is the fact
that the islands were then,

03:37.258 --> 03:41.845
as now, largely remote
and, in some cases,

03:41.846 --> 03:44.098
relatively uninhabited.

03:45.766 --> 03:49.061
If I were an extraterrestrial
in-in the remote past

03:49.062 --> 03:51.479
and I was looking
for the perfect laboratory

03:51.480 --> 03:55.191
to engineer
a new species of mankind,

03:55.192 --> 03:58.779
I would look no further than the
most remote place on the Earth,

03:58.780 --> 04:00.615
which is the Hawaiian Islands.

04:01.657 --> 04:03.866
Before the arrival of Europeans,

04:03.867 --> 04:07.954
there were no reptiles,
no mosquitoes, no rats.

04:07.955 --> 04:12.250
It was as pure a place
as any on our planet.

04:12.251 --> 04:15.169
And in many ways,
it was the perfect spot

04:15.170 --> 04:17.214
for a terrestrial laboratory.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.138
NARRATOR:
In addition to being

04:26.139 --> 04:29.017
one of the most remote places
on the planet,

04:29.018 --> 04:32.520
Hawaii is also
one of the most volatile.

04:32.521 --> 04:37.150
It is home to literally hundreds
of volcanoes,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.237
and three of them
are still very active.

04:49.538 --> 04:52.958
WILLIAM HENRY: She was embodied
as a beautiful woman,

04:52.959 --> 04:57.337
Hawaiian mythology says,
who also had a wrathful nature,

04:57.338 --> 04:59.172
and if you didn't
respect her wishes,

04:59.173 --> 05:01.299
it was not gonna be
a very good day.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.554
FELICIA BEARDSLEY: Pele is an
angry goddess, in many ways.

05:06.555 --> 05:09.724
But she's also seen
as a creator,

05:09.725 --> 05:11.600
because she creates land.

05:11.601 --> 05:15.688
There's a belief and-and
a full-on respect of Pele.

05:15.689 --> 05:20.027
NARRATOR: For Hawaiian natives,
Pele is but one of many beings

05:20.028 --> 05:22.195
they call "star people,"

05:22.196 --> 05:24.196
and all things
that happen on Earth

05:24.197 --> 05:26.575
are connected to the stars.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.535
Each autumn,

05:28.536 --> 05:31.912
when the Pleiades star system
appears on the horizon,

05:31.913 --> 05:34.708
practitioners
of the old native Hawaiian faith

05:34.709 --> 05:36.960
gather to celebrate the harvest

05:36.961 --> 05:39.546
and honor
the otherworldly visitors

05:39.547 --> 05:43.718
whose direct descendants
also serve as the tribal elites.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.777
NARRATOR: In ancient times,
the largest harvest season celebrations

06:02.778 --> 06:06.573
occurred at the foot
of Hawaii's tallest mountain,

06:06.574 --> 06:10.494
which, according to legend, was
the central geological feature

06:10.495 --> 06:13.496
of a lost continent
called Lemuria.

06:13.497 --> 06:16.917
There are countless stories
about a lost continent

06:16.918 --> 06:19.126
that was swallowed up
by the sea,

06:19.127 --> 06:21.296
and that continent
was called Lemuria.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.590
Lemuria is said
to have been the home

06:23.591 --> 06:26.092
of the planet's
tallest mountain.

06:26.093 --> 06:29.261
So in order to determine
Lemuria's possible location

06:29.262 --> 06:32.474
in a region that-that could fit
our mythology,

06:32.475 --> 06:34.725
we have to change
our perspective a little bit.

06:34.726 --> 06:37.686
When considering mountains that
rise directly from the floor

06:37.687 --> 06:41.775
of a tectonic plate...
Which Mount Everest doesn't do...

06:41.776 --> 06:46.112
And the distance from the actual
base to the actual summit,

06:46.113 --> 06:50.200
Mauna Kea is by far the tallest
mountain in the world

06:50.201 --> 06:54.788
and it's nearly a mile taller
than Mount Everest.

06:56.249 --> 07:01.210
It is the most massive land mass
on the planet,

07:01.211 --> 07:05.422
and it is a critical place
when it comes to the traditions

07:05.423 --> 07:07.258
of the Hawaiian Islanders

07:07.259 --> 07:11.221
welcoming back
the star visitors.

07:12.389 --> 07:15.433
It's also the time
of the rising of the Pleiades,

07:15.434 --> 07:19.186
and what it signals is this time
of great joy and festivities.

07:19.187 --> 07:24.693
The people gather to celebrate
prosperity or coming prosperity.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.361
NARRATOR:
For native Hawaiians,

07:27.362 --> 07:30.948
the Pleiades is much more
than just a constellation.

07:30.949 --> 07:36.912
This cluster of stars, 444.2
light-years away, are the stars

07:36.913 --> 07:41.458
from which the native Hawaiians
trace their very origins.

07:41.459 --> 07:45.754
The Pleiades plays an absolutely
central role in the mythology

07:45.755 --> 07:48.299
of people spread
right across the Pacific.

07:48.300 --> 07:53.972
All the way to Australia, Japan,
we hear these stories

07:53.973 --> 07:58.643
that, once upon a time, beings
from the Pleiades arrived here.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.229
And that they in some way
involved themselves

08:01.230 --> 08:02.856
in human evolution.

08:02.857 --> 08:07.861
There is no question
that the elders of Hawaii

08:07.862 --> 08:13.326
have a belief that their
ancestors came from the stars.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.374
NARRATOR: In the Hawaiian
tradition, the star people

08:21.375 --> 08:25.378
are most often referred to
as the akua or atua,

08:25.379 --> 08:29.382
and are responsible
for the creation of humankind.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.809
HENRY:
These are supernatural beings

08:40.811 --> 08:44.480
that appear to have
superhuman powers.

08:44.481 --> 08:47.316
The chiefs and royalty
of ancient Hawaii

08:47.317 --> 08:50.362
were considered to be
the offspring of the atua.

08:50.363 --> 08:54.407
NARRATOR: Similarly named creator
gods can be found in cultures

08:54.408 --> 08:57.494
throughout Oceania,
a geographic region

08:57.495 --> 09:00.372
which includes
Australasia, Melanesia,

09:00.373 --> 09:03.542
Micronesia, and Polynesia.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.920
In Micronesia,
they call them aitu.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.630
In the Philippines, anito.

09:09.631 --> 09:13.176
And in Malaysia, ant...

09:13.177 --> 09:17.513
The terms atua and akua
for a type of gods or beings

09:17.514 --> 09:19.974
throughout the Pacific region
is-is quite fascinating.

09:19.975 --> 09:23.686
Because when we dig
into that lore,

09:23.687 --> 09:25.479
we're told
that there's these entities

09:25.480 --> 09:29.276
that are often,
in some sense, invisible,

09:29.277 --> 09:33.488
but can interact
with human beings and animals.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.699
You know, are these some kind of

09:35.700 --> 09:37.533
interdimensional
extraterrestrials

09:37.534 --> 09:39.702
that can hide themself at will,

09:39.703 --> 09:44.874
engineer situations where they
can then appear to be humans?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.585
It's a very strange set
of legends.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.461
I suspect that
we really have here

09:49.462 --> 09:53.800
a history pointing to some kind
of ancient visitation,

09:53.801 --> 09:55.551
with these beings arriving

09:55.552 --> 09:58.639
and involving themself
in human origins.

10:02.934 --> 10:06.687
NARRATOR: Could it be,
as ancient astronaut theorists suggest,

10:06.688 --> 10:09.816
that the story of humankind's
true origins can be found

10:09.817 --> 10:12.819
within the Hawaiian traditions,

10:12.820 --> 10:17.157
and that these islands
were a point of first contact?

10:17.158 --> 10:20.410
Perhaps further clues
can be found

10:20.411 --> 10:23.455
by examining
the iconic wooden sculptures

10:23.456 --> 10:27.585
that exist throughout the entire
Hawaiian Island chain...

10:28.836 --> 10:30.837
the tiki.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.341
CHILDRESS:
So, you're thinking these

10:35.342 --> 10:36.843
- are extraterrestrial races?
- Totally.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.845
SALLA: The akua came
here with spacecrafts.

10:39.846 --> 10:42.849
This one is pretty odd,
standing here by the water.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.269
SALLA:
That's a Grey extraterrestrial.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.067
NARRATOR:
Honaunau, Hawaii.

10:53.068 --> 10:55.821
June 2019.

10:57.447 --> 11:00.115
On the west coast

11:00.116 --> 11:02.701
of what is commonly called
the Big Island,

11:02.702 --> 11:05.580
ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress

11:05.581 --> 11:06.955
is traveling with his colleague

11:06.956 --> 11:10.125
Dr. Michael Salla,
a Hawaiian resident

11:10.126 --> 11:12.420
and an expert on local history.

11:12.421 --> 11:17.133
It is David's belief that,
thousands of years ago,

11:17.134 --> 11:18.676
this area of the world

11:18.677 --> 11:21.888
was not only a place
of alien visitation,

11:21.889 --> 11:25.767
but was actually inhabited
by extraterrestrials.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.351
CHILDRESS:
Well, Michael,

11:27.352 --> 11:29.896
I'm really excited to be here
in Hawaii with you.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.190
I've traveled
around the Pacific,

11:32.191 --> 11:33.983
and I have been
to Hawaii before,

11:33.984 --> 11:38.238
but I really want to understand
Hawaii's extraterrestrial past

11:38.239 --> 11:41.032
and its ancient history,

11:41.033 --> 11:43.660
the many unusual sites
here, and,

11:43.661 --> 11:46.245
and even what's going on today
here in Hawaii.

11:46.246 --> 11:49.039
SALLA: It's fascinating.
I mean, this is something

11:49.040 --> 11:50.917
that I didn't expect
when I moved out here,

11:50.918 --> 11:53.670
that Hawaii had this kind of
extraterrestrial contact,

11:53.671 --> 11:55.087
this, uh, this history,

11:55.088 --> 11:57.590
but that's one of the things
I kept hearing,

11:57.591 --> 12:01.720
and as I began to learn more
about Hawaii's history,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.263
it became clear

12:03.264 --> 12:06.891
that a lot of Hawaiians
really trace their ancestors

12:06.892 --> 12:08.560
to extraterrestrial visitors

12:08.561 --> 12:11.229
that came here tens of thousands
of years ago.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.856
NARRATOR: David and
Michael are on their way

12:13.857 --> 12:18.069
to Pu'uhonua o Honaunau
National Historical Park,

12:18.070 --> 12:22.532
home to a number of giant
statues and native exhibits.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.493
SALLA:
At Honaunau you have this,

12:25.494 --> 12:27.412
uh, temple complex,

12:27.413 --> 12:31.582
uh, which basically dates back
to the Hawaiian Kingdom

12:31.583 --> 12:36.546
and it has some of the best tiki
statues of the akua, the gods...

12:36.547 --> 12:38.715
Extraterrestrials in my view...

12:38.716 --> 12:41.217
That you can find
anywhere on the islands.

12:42.802 --> 12:44.012
NARRATOR:
At the park,

12:44.013 --> 12:47.056
a great wall marks a boundary
between an area

12:47.057 --> 12:49.808
that was once considered
royal grounds

12:49.809 --> 12:52.103
and a sanctuary
where lawbreakers

12:52.104 --> 12:54.689
could gain refuge
and absolution.

12:54.690 --> 12:58.692
Iconic wooden statues
with strange features

12:58.693 --> 13:01.696
surround the Hale o Keawe
temple, which houses the remains

13:01.697 --> 13:04.782
of Hawaiian chiefs,

13:04.783 --> 13:07.494
remains that are still thought
by the native Hawaiians

13:07.495 --> 13:11.413
to emanate power, or mana,
throughout the area.

13:11.414 --> 13:14.209
David, I know
you've got this theory

13:14.210 --> 13:16.503
about extraterrestrial contact

13:16.504 --> 13:19.172
and technology being spread
throughout the Pacific,

13:19.173 --> 13:20.757
and we've got some

13:20.758 --> 13:23.843
really interesting tikis that
I think kind of lend support

13:23.844 --> 13:24.885
to that theory.

13:24.886 --> 13:27.638
Yeah, they look
pretty interesting, and, uh,

13:27.639 --> 13:29.556
this one is pretty odd.

13:29.557 --> 13:31.808
He's standing here by the water.

13:31.809 --> 13:33.811
SALLA:
When I first saw that tiki,

13:33.812 --> 13:35.647
first thought that came
to my mind was,

13:35.648 --> 13:38.358
"That's a Grey
extraterrestrial."

13:38.359 --> 13:41.360
And this is one
of the kind of helpers,

13:41.361 --> 13:43.696
or the menehune,
that the Hawaiians

13:43.697 --> 13:47.282
believe were created
by the gods, or the akua.

13:47.283 --> 13:50.077
So, is this the akua
right here, these guys

13:50.078 --> 13:52.622
- with the big headdresses?
- SALLA: Exactly, yeah.

13:52.623 --> 13:56.542
Those are the akua.
They had four principal akua

13:56.543 --> 13:59.045
that were basically
the creators of humanity

13:59.046 --> 14:02.005
and helped establish
civilization on the planet.

14:02.006 --> 14:04.551
NARRATOR:
One year ago,

14:04.552 --> 14:08.053
when David was investigating
the Marquesas Islands,

14:08.054 --> 14:11.099
located 2,300 miles
south of Hawaii,

14:11.100 --> 14:13.935
he encountered
similar tiki statues,

14:13.936 --> 14:16.144
and discovered that they, too,

14:16.145 --> 14:19.106
are associated
with ancient gods.

14:19.107 --> 14:22.652
But here in Honaunau

14:22.653 --> 14:25.404
there appear to be
two different types of beings

14:25.405 --> 14:28.199
depicted by the tiki.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.660
So you're thinking
these are two different

14:30.661 --> 14:32.287
- extraterrestrial races?
- Totally.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.413
CHILDRESS: They have
different kind of eyes, too.

14:34.414 --> 14:36.164
SALLA:
Yeah, I mean, this to me,

14:36.165 --> 14:38.292
looks like the akua
were extraterrestrial

14:38.293 --> 14:41.170
and they knew about
genetic experimentation

14:41.171 --> 14:43.255
and they created these beings,

14:43.256 --> 14:44.923
menehune, or Grey aliens,

14:44.924 --> 14:46.341
to basically be servants.

14:46.342 --> 14:48.845
And you can see that,
from the lack of a headdress,

14:48.846 --> 14:50.053
they're bald,

14:50.054 --> 14:52.473
which signifies they had
low social status.

14:52.474 --> 14:56.268
NARRATOR: According to
ancient Hawaiian stories,

14:56.269 --> 15:00.648
the menehune were humanlike
beings of short stature

15:00.649 --> 15:03.066
who were created by the akua.

15:03.067 --> 15:05.402
KAPAHULEHUA: The menehunes was
a little dwarf people,

15:05.403 --> 15:07.696
and, uh, they always
came out in the evening

15:07.697 --> 15:11.284
because they were
not so much humanlike-looking.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.580
YOUNG:
Menehune are small,

15:15.581 --> 15:17.915
magical creatures
that are thought

15:17.916 --> 15:19.792
sometimes to have been
descendants

15:19.793 --> 15:21.628
of the earliest inhabitants

15:21.629 --> 15:24.379
that came before the Hawaiians
from Polynesia.

15:24.380 --> 15:28.594
There are canals,
waterways, gulfs...

15:29.636 --> 15:32.305
built, they say,
by the menehune.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.306
The work was done at night.

15:34.307 --> 15:36.975
They don't want to be seen and
they work incredibly quickly,

15:36.976 --> 15:39.519
so sometimes a whole
retaining wall

15:39.520 --> 15:41.315
will have been built
in a single night.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.777
LOREN COLEMAN:
I visited all of the structures

15:45.778 --> 15:49.364
that supposedly were built
by the menehune.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.824
There's a menehune fishpond

15:51.825 --> 15:56.995
that's huge,
has 900 feet of a wall

15:56.996 --> 15:59.164
surrounding this one area

15:59.165 --> 16:02.542
and then they would use that
as a reservoir for fish.

16:02.543 --> 16:06.714
There's also called
the Menehune Ditch.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.591
It was a way
to channel fresh water.

16:09.592 --> 16:12.010
It is old in structure

16:12.011 --> 16:13.345
and before the Hawaiians.

16:13.346 --> 16:16.682
NARRATOR:
Before the Hawaiians?

16:16.683 --> 16:19.185
Could this account
of a pre-Hawaiian

16:19.186 --> 16:21.896
and pre-human water channel
lend credence

16:21.897 --> 16:24.606
to the Hawaiian genesis story,

16:24.607 --> 16:27.026
a story which also
contains depictions

16:27.027 --> 16:30.153
of genetic engineering?

16:30.154 --> 16:34.367
These were, I believe,
extraterrestrial hybrids

16:34.368 --> 16:38.412
that had been created
to help the Pleiadeans

16:38.413 --> 16:42.959
and other races establish
their civilizations

16:42.960 --> 16:46.421
or their genetic experiments
on the Earth.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.505
The menehune
are said to have built

16:48.506 --> 16:52.051
these unusual structures
on Kaua'i.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.095
Archaeologists do not know
who built them.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.513
The Hawaiians say, "Oh,

16:55.514 --> 16:58.056
"these little people
of the past,

16:58.057 --> 17:00.143
they're the ones
that built them."

17:00.144 --> 17:01.643
These little people

17:01.644 --> 17:05.355
are somehow ancestors
to the Hawaiians,

17:05.356 --> 17:07.607
who are actually
very tall and large.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.361
The Polynesians
are the largest race of people

17:10.362 --> 17:12.946
still on the planet, and yet

17:12.948 --> 17:16.284
their own stories go back
to these little people

17:16.285 --> 17:18.786
who are building stuff for them.

17:18.787 --> 17:22.038
NARRATOR:
While many dismiss the menehune

17:22.039 --> 17:24.584
as little more than
mythological figures,

17:24.585 --> 17:27.627
a census from 200 years ago

17:27.627 --> 17:30.256
seems to provide
historical documentation

17:30.257 --> 17:34.218
that they may have
actually existed.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.430
COLEMAN:
The first census on Kaua'i

17:37.431 --> 17:42.101
took place in 1820,
and that census said that,

17:42.102 --> 17:45.020
of the 2,000 people
that were counted,

17:45.021 --> 17:48.066
65 of them were menehune.

17:48.067 --> 17:52.527
NARRATOR: Confirming the
account of the 1820 census,

17:52.528 --> 17:55.948
the <i> Hawaiian Almanac
and Annual of 1913</i>

17:55.949 --> 17:58.785
states that during the reign
of Kaumualii

17:58.786 --> 18:03.623
in the early 19th century,
a census recorded 65 menehune

18:03.624 --> 18:06.918
living in the small hamlet
of Laau.

18:06.919 --> 18:11.463
The almanac reports an
"allied race of older extraction

18:11.464 --> 18:13.841
2 1/2 to three feet high"

18:13.842 --> 18:17.595
and concludes "as far as
the little people of Laau,

18:17.596 --> 18:20.806
they were forgotten
in the lapse of years."

18:20.807 --> 18:24.559
CHILDRESS:
Hawaiian Islands are so remote.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.063
This is one of the most remote
places in the world.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.525
Do you think that Hawaii
was, perhaps, some special

18:30.526 --> 18:34.319
- extraterrestrial base?
- I believe so.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.322
And it's interesting
that this area

18:36.323 --> 18:38.825
is part of Kealakekua
which ac... literally means

18:38.826 --> 18:41.117
- "Pathway of the Gods."
- Pathway of the Gods, okay.

18:41.118 --> 18:42.828
Well, that can be translated
as "doorway."

18:42.829 --> 18:45.623
NARRATOR:
Are the tikis a record

18:45.624 --> 18:49.168
of ancient alien activity
in Hawaii?

18:49.169 --> 18:52.129
If so, what were
the islands used for?

18:52.130 --> 18:55.298
And where did these
otherworldly visitors go?

18:55.299 --> 19:00.762
Perhaps further clues
can be found by venturing inside

19:00.763 --> 19:04.017
one of the island's
largest volcanoes.

19:08.271 --> 19:12.357
E Pacific Ocean. 20,000 BC.

19:12.358 --> 19:16.278
It is during this period
that the surface of the Earth

19:16.279 --> 19:18.905
is frozen in the grip
of a glacial period

19:18.906 --> 19:21.867
otherwise known as the Ice Age.

19:21.868 --> 19:25.371
It is a time when sea levels
are dramatically lower,

19:25.372 --> 19:29.624
nearly 400 feet below
where they are today,

19:29.625 --> 19:34.130
and these lower sea levels have
created expansive landmasses

19:34.131 --> 19:35.381
which, as the ice melts,

19:35.382 --> 19:38.092
some 12,000 years ago,

19:38.093 --> 19:42.513
begin to disappear beneath the
surface of the rising oceans.

19:46.058 --> 19:49.060
Is it possible that
some of these landmasses

19:49.061 --> 19:52.315
were home to lost civilizations?

19:52.316 --> 19:56.027
Civilizations for which we have
no historical record

19:56.028 --> 19:58.194
and which may have been
far more advanced

19:58.195 --> 20:00.906
than we know?

20:00.907 --> 20:05.368
We live on a very restless Earth
that's constantly moving

20:05.369 --> 20:08.414
with earthquakes and tsunamis
and volcanic activity.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.668
Continents rise and fall.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.671
Mountain ranges are torn apart.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.966
All kinds of civilizations
could have come

20:18.967 --> 20:21.802
and gone on our planet.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.095
We know that there are over 200

20:24.096 --> 20:26.932
known submerged cities
in the Mediterranean.

20:26.933 --> 20:29.184
There's just so much
on our planet

20:29.185 --> 20:30.685
that we have yet to find out.

20:30.686 --> 20:33.146
NARRATOR:
Throughout history,

20:33.147 --> 20:35.316
a number of stories
have been told

20:35.317 --> 20:38.861
about great civilizations
that disappeared into the ocean

20:38.862 --> 20:40.488
thousands of years ago.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.950
The most famous
of these, Atlantis,

20:43.951 --> 20:47.620
was written about by Plato
in the fourth century BC

20:47.621 --> 20:51.124
and is still believed by many
to have truly existed.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.670
But there is another
lost continent

20:55.671 --> 20:59.464
that is said to have existed
at the same time as Atlantis

20:59.465 --> 21:02.468
and looms large
in Hawaiian traditions:

21:02.469 --> 21:05.637
Lemuria.

21:05.638 --> 21:07.640
Lemuria was in
the South Pacific.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.142
It is thought to have connected
the Hawaiian Islands

21:10.143 --> 21:13.187
and the other island systems
out in that part of the planet,

21:13.188 --> 21:15.648
so it was a huge land bridge.

21:17.692 --> 21:19.735
In the lore, Lemuria

21:19.736 --> 21:23.239
was an extraordinary
civilization before it sank

21:23.240 --> 21:24.699
into the sea.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.826
Story has it, Hawaii
is a surviving fragment

21:27.827 --> 21:31.329
of the enormous landmass.

21:31.330 --> 21:34.249
Lemuria existed prior
to the last great flood

21:34.250 --> 21:37.545
that occurred around 9600 BC,
which was a catastrophe,

21:37.546 --> 21:41.047
which led to the water levels
all around the Earth rising

21:41.048 --> 21:43.008
as much as 400 feet.

21:43.009 --> 21:46.886
NARRATOR: According to legend,
before the two lost continents

21:46.887 --> 21:48.764
were destroyed by a great flood,

21:48.765 --> 21:52.644
there was a war between Lemuria
and Atlantis.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.565
SALLA: This was the destruction
of the Lemurian civilization.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.232
The Lemurians were driven

21:59.233 --> 22:01.610
into these underground
cavern systems.

22:01.611 --> 22:05.114
The Hawaiian peoples
really understand

22:05.115 --> 22:09.535
that they are the descendants
of some great civilizations,

22:09.536 --> 22:11.453
and that they have some kind
of responsibility

22:11.454 --> 22:13.789
of preserving the culture
of that.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.046
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorist David Childress

22:20.047 --> 22:23.089
and Hawaiian history expert
Dr. Michael Salla

22:23.090 --> 22:26.844
are on the Big Island to explore
the underground caverns

22:26.845 --> 22:28.929
the Lemurians are said
to have retreated to.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.181
SALLA: Yeah,
there is a bit of spelunking

22:30.182 --> 22:31.182
here on the Big Island.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.267
NARRATOR:
These caverns are actually

22:33.268 --> 22:35.143
enormous lava tubes

22:35.144 --> 22:37.771
that exist throughout
the volcanic island chain,

22:37.772 --> 22:41.483
and some locals believe
they are still inhabited

22:41.484 --> 22:43.402
by the Lemurians.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.779
CHILDRESS:
Wow, this is huge.

22:45.780 --> 22:48.574
SALLA: Yeah, it goes back
two miles in that direction,

22:48.575 --> 22:52.077
and the whole lava tube
is 25 miles long,

22:52.078 --> 22:54.246
- all the way from Mauna Loa.
- Wow.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.040
These walls are
30 feet high or more.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.584
SALLA: Right.
There's lava tubes that are

22:58.585 --> 23:00.460
- much bigger than this as well.
- Okay.

23:00.461 --> 23:01.754
Tell me what happened here.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.756
SALLA:
Well, this is part

23:03.757 --> 23:05.423
of an extensive cavern system

23:05.424 --> 23:07.258
throughout
the Big Island of Hawaii,

23:07.259 --> 23:09.053
where you have these lava tubes.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.097
And this kind of cavern
and these lava tubes

23:12.098 --> 23:13.973
have been here
for tens of thousands,

23:13.974 --> 23:16.810
hundreds of thousands of years,
so at some point

23:16.811 --> 23:20.772
in its history the Lemurians
found this cavern system

23:20.773 --> 23:21.856
and built it out.

23:21.857 --> 23:23.983
And so, when they were in a war

23:23.984 --> 23:26.112
against the Atlantians,
this was their refuge.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.905
So, down inside
these lava tubes,

23:28.906 --> 23:31.741
what do you think, that
there are, like, secret doors

23:31.742 --> 23:34.662
that are hidden
with this high technology?

23:34.663 --> 23:37.373
SALLA: Well, there's a lot of
secrets in these lava tubes,

23:37.374 --> 23:38.833
in these caves.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.126
What we're not seeing
in the caves

23:41.127 --> 23:43.837
are entry points
into this hidden labyrinth

23:43.838 --> 23:46.089
of portals and tunnel systems

23:46.090 --> 23:49.384
that lie underneath
the entire Big Island.

23:49.385 --> 23:50.845
They're well hidden.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.971
This is part of Hawaiian legend.

23:52.972 --> 23:55.682
The extraterrestrials
had cloaking technology,

23:55.683 --> 23:59.311
and so the doorways would just
look like an ordinary rock face.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.690
NARRATOR:
According to Hawaiian legend,

24:02.691 --> 24:04.858
these lava tubes
have been inhabited

24:04.859 --> 24:07.236
not only
by the ancient Lemurians

24:07.237 --> 24:09.572
but also by the akua,

24:09.573 --> 24:12.031
the visitors that are said
to have arrived here

24:12.032 --> 24:13.284
from the Pleiades...

24:13.285 --> 24:15.201
and the dwarf people
they created

24:15.202 --> 24:17.078
called the menehune.

24:17.079 --> 24:21.416
But if these ancient ancestors
of Hawaii possessed technology

24:21.417 --> 24:24.836
that allowed them to conceal
doorways to secret passages

24:24.837 --> 24:27.006
and chambers
within the lava tubes,

24:27.007 --> 24:29.133
could they still be
hiding out in them...

24:29.134 --> 24:30.758
today?

24:30.759 --> 24:32.886
CHILDRESS: There's other
places around the Earth

24:32.887 --> 24:35.514
where there are these
strange tunnels like this,

24:35.515 --> 24:39.184
and sometimes people are said
to go inside them and...

24:39.185 --> 24:42.688
and disappear,
or they encounter strange beings

24:42.689 --> 24:43.897
inside these tunnels.

24:43.898 --> 24:45.816
- Has that happened here?
- Oh, definitely.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.735
I mean, there are a lot
of Hawaiian stories

24:47.736 --> 24:49.361
of people going
into these tunnels

24:49.362 --> 24:51.654
and having encounters
with menehune

24:51.655 --> 24:55.366
or with the sorcerers or even
with the akua themselves.

24:55.367 --> 24:58.037
I've even had an experience here
with my wife where...

24:58.038 --> 24:59.704
we had some kind
of mystical experience

24:59.705 --> 25:02.249
where the akua communicated
and basically said,

25:02.250 --> 25:03.834
"We're coming back."

25:03.835 --> 25:06.461
A telepathic communication...
Just she suddenly had...

25:06.462 --> 25:09.047
- inside this tunnel?
- That's right, in this very tunnel.

25:09.048 --> 25:10.466
We were meditating,

25:10.467 --> 25:12.634
and she had that kind
of telepathic download.

25:12.635 --> 25:14.553
On its own,
it just doesn't mean much,

25:14.554 --> 25:16.095
but many other people have had

25:16.096 --> 25:17.640
these kinds
of mystical experiences

25:17.641 --> 25:20.392
in the caverns,
and even had encounters

25:20.393 --> 25:22.686
with beings in these caverns.

25:26.066 --> 25:29.567
NARRATOR: If people today
are reporting encounters

25:29.568 --> 25:31.694
with strange beings
in the lava tubes,

25:31.695 --> 25:34.155
where are they coming from?

25:34.156 --> 25:37.450
Could it be that Hawaii
was not only a hub

25:37.451 --> 25:40.954
of extraterrestrial visitation
thousands of years ago,

25:40.955 --> 25:43.665
but that it continues to serve
as an entry point

25:43.666 --> 25:46.293
for otherworldly visitors?

25:46.294 --> 25:48.921
But if so, how is it possible

25:48.922 --> 25:52.799
that such activity
continues undetected?

25:52.800 --> 25:56.428
Ancient astronaut theorists say
the answer can be found

25:56.429 --> 25:59.390
by examining sacred rock art,

25:59.391 --> 26:04.061
which suggests Hawaii is home
to an incredible anomaly.

26:12.528 --> 26:15.280
CH Pu'u Loa Petroglyph Field.

26:15.281 --> 26:16.991
Hawaii.

26:18.492 --> 26:21.202
Ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress

26:21.203 --> 26:25.249
and Hawaiian resident
and historian Dr. Michael Salla

26:25.250 --> 26:28.294
have arrived at Pu'u Loa
to continue their investigation

26:28.295 --> 26:31.087
of Hawaii's ancient secrets.

26:31.088 --> 26:36.384
At Pu'u Loa, over 23,000
individual works of art

26:36.385 --> 26:40.221
stretch over several miles
of rocky terrain.

26:40.222 --> 26:42.181
CHILDRESS:
You know, Michael,

26:42.182 --> 26:44.559
our access to the petroglyphs
here is quite limited,

26:44.560 --> 26:47.270
because this is
a very sacred area.

26:47.271 --> 26:49.565
But from these petroglyphs
that I see,

26:49.566 --> 26:52.985
they're identical to what
you see in Easter Island,

26:52.986 --> 26:55.653
throughout Polynesia, really.

26:55.654 --> 26:57.823
What we see here
with the human figures,

26:57.824 --> 27:00.575
they're holding their arms
and their postures.

27:00.576 --> 27:03.370
This is identical, really,

27:03.371 --> 27:04.372
to Rongorongo.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.789
NARRATOR:
Rongorongo?

27:06.790 --> 27:08.750
The mysterious ancient script

27:08.751 --> 27:11.045
that has been found
on Easter Island,

27:11.046 --> 27:13.673
roughly 4,500 miles away?

27:15.174 --> 27:18.509
CHILDRESS: These petroglyphs
are very unusual.

27:18.510 --> 27:20.679
They're humanoid figures,

27:20.680 --> 27:22.765
but each one is different.

27:22.766 --> 27:26.268
Actually, they're very similar
to the Rongorongo writing

27:26.269 --> 27:28.354
that we find at Easter Island

27:28.355 --> 27:32.192
that is still undeciphered
and mysterious.

27:34.318 --> 27:36.778
So, some Hawaiians, David,
believe that Hawaii

27:36.779 --> 27:39.323
was the birthing place
of all humanity,

27:39.324 --> 27:40.740
that this is
the legendary Hawaiki,

27:40.741 --> 27:44.202
this is where the... people,
the humanity was birthed

27:44.203 --> 27:46.788
and actually spread
throughout all of Polynesia

27:46.789 --> 27:48.915
and throughout
the entire planet.

27:48.916 --> 27:52.627
CHILDRESS: So, what do you
think about this one right here

27:52.628 --> 27:54.880
in the middle
with the concentric circles?

27:54.881 --> 27:57.799
You see this
in the American Southwest,

27:57.800 --> 28:01.178
where, in fact, the American
Indians call these portals.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.556
Where you have concentric
circles are going around,

28:04.557 --> 28:07.809
uh, sometimes a spiral,
and for them,

28:07.810 --> 28:09.853
it is also...
it's an energy field,

28:09.854 --> 28:12.730
a-a portal to other dimensions.

28:12.731 --> 28:14.441
SALLA: Right, well,
that-that would fit in

28:14.442 --> 28:17.193
with, um, a lot of the things
that Hawaiians believe

28:17.194 --> 28:20.029
about the Big Island...
That this is sacred ground,

28:20.030 --> 28:23.659
there's a lot of energy
that flows through this island.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.993
It even goes back
to the kind of idea

28:25.994 --> 28:27.996
of Hawaii being
the birthing place

28:27.997 --> 28:29.414
for the whole
Polynesian peoples.

28:29.415 --> 28:32.166
For all the Polynesian people,
and-and also that...

28:32.167 --> 28:35.922
- that Hawaii itself is a portal, right?
- That's right, yeah.

28:38.924 --> 28:40.758
NARRATOR:
A portal?

28:40.759 --> 28:43.595
Did the ancient
Polynesian people believe

28:43.596 --> 28:47.516
that some kind of cosmic gateway
existed in Hawaii,

28:47.517 --> 28:49.518
through which beings
could travel here

28:49.519 --> 28:51.894
from other parts
of the universe?

28:51.895 --> 28:54.940
The scientific concept
of a wormhole

28:54.941 --> 28:57.108
was first proposed
by Albert Einstein

28:57.109 --> 29:00.695
and Nathan Rosen in 1935,

29:00.696 --> 29:03.699
who suggested
that space-time could be bent

29:03.700 --> 29:07.201
to bring
two distant points together.

29:07.202 --> 29:09.454
While it may sound far-fetched,

29:09.455 --> 29:12.082
some scientists suggest
it is possible

29:12.083 --> 29:16.461
that such portals, or wormholes,
may actually exist,

29:16.462 --> 29:18.630
and not only in deep space

29:18.631 --> 29:21.216
but also right here on Earth.

29:21.217 --> 29:24.094
JOHN BRANDENBURG:
It became sort of accepted

29:24.095 --> 29:26.805
as actually being real
that there would be portals,

29:26.806 --> 29:28.806
or wormholes, in space.

29:28.807 --> 29:31.268
But as we deepen
our understanding of physics,

29:31.269 --> 29:34.729
it raises the possibility
of wormholes and portals

29:34.730 --> 29:37.732
being able to be accessible
here on Earth.

29:37.733 --> 29:40.235
It appears possible,
theoretically,

29:40.236 --> 29:42.946
to manipulate
electromagnetic fields

29:42.947 --> 29:44.823
and change the structure
of space-time,

29:44.824 --> 29:46.240
perhaps dramatically.

29:46.241 --> 29:49.745
Now, can this happen
in a geophysical realm?

29:49.746 --> 29:51.246
Possibly.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.164
The Earth has a magnetic field,

29:53.165 --> 29:55.334
it has an electric field,

29:55.335 --> 29:57.960
and those vary
from place to place.

29:57.961 --> 30:01.339
Would there be areas on Earth
where perhaps...

30:01.340 --> 30:04.968
might be prone
to space-time instability,

30:04.969 --> 30:06.678
changes in topology,

30:06.679 --> 30:09.265
doors, portals
opening and closing?

30:10.307 --> 30:11.893
It's very possible.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.229
NARRATOR:
According to geologists,

30:15.230 --> 30:18.690
the undersea magma source
called the "Hawaii hot spot"

30:18.691 --> 30:21.943
continues to give birth
to new volcanoes.

30:21.944 --> 30:25.530
And the volcanic rock produced
by these volcanoes

30:25.531 --> 30:27.865
are rich
in crystalline materials

30:27.866 --> 30:31.202
that are capable of producing
electromagnetic fields

30:31.203 --> 30:33.622
by means of what
scientists refer to

30:33.623 --> 30:36.041
as the piezoelectric effect.

30:39.711 --> 30:42.672
If you have a region with...

30:42.673 --> 30:44.717
an electric field anomaly...

30:45.718 --> 30:47.719
and if you can create

30:47.720 --> 30:50.346
strong enough
electromagnetic phenomena,

30:50.347 --> 30:54.893
you can perhaps change
the geometry of space-time,

30:54.894 --> 30:56.979
leading to portal-like
phenomena.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.522
NARRATOR: Does the unique
geography of Hawaii

30:59.523 --> 31:01.732
offer the perfect conditions

31:01.733 --> 31:04.902
for the shifting
of electromagnetic energy?

31:04.903 --> 31:09.658
Conditions that could
actually bend space and time,

31:09.659 --> 31:13.703
resulting in the creation
of a time-space portal?

31:13.704 --> 31:16.248
According to many
ancient astronaut theorists,

31:16.249 --> 31:20.210
the answer is a profound yes.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.379
Hawaii was the place
where a lot of humanity

31:22.380 --> 31:24.839
and extraterrestrials
were able to travel through

31:24.840 --> 31:27.425
to go to other places
throughout the Pacific

31:27.426 --> 31:29.344
and the entire planet.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.721
And that's been happening
for centuries, millennia,

31:31.722 --> 31:34.056
and it's even happening now.

31:34.057 --> 31:37.435
NARRATOR: If the island
of Hawaii once served

31:37.436 --> 31:39.395
as some sort of spaceport,

31:39.396 --> 31:42.399
a destination
where extraterrestrial visitors

31:42.400 --> 31:45.777
were able to come by means
of an interdimensional gateway,

31:45.778 --> 31:50.199
or portal, could that portal
still be operating today?

31:51.284 --> 31:53.410
Perhaps the answer can be found

31:53.411 --> 31:55.077
by examining the area located

31:55.078 --> 32:00.416
at the exact same latitude
as Hawaii's biggest volcano,

32:00.417 --> 32:03.962
but located on another planet.

32:10.928 --> 32:14.139
NARRATOR:
Mauna Loa, the Big Island.

32:14.140 --> 32:19.353
This active volcano is one
of the largest in the world,

32:19.354 --> 32:21.813
and is estimated
to have been erupting

32:21.814 --> 32:24.857
for at least 700,000 years.

32:24.858 --> 32:29.570
Not far from Mauna Loa
is the Kilauea hot spot

32:29.571 --> 32:32.824
that continues to spew lava
to this day.

32:32.825 --> 32:36.202
But perhaps the most significant
aspect of Mauna Loa

32:36.203 --> 32:39.247
is its location on planet Earth.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.459
Now, one of the critical things
to keep in mind

32:42.460 --> 32:46.672
is that the Mauna Loa volcano
in particular is located

32:46.673 --> 32:52.719
at 19.47 latitude
in the Northern Hemisphere.

32:52.720 --> 32:57.181
That area sitting at 19.47
is called Kealakekua,

32:57.182 --> 33:00.184
which means
"Pathway of the Gods."

33:00.185 --> 33:03.479
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

33:03.480 --> 33:06.900
natural formations and
structures found at a latitude

33:06.901 --> 33:11.113
of 19.5 degrees
form a kind of a pattern,

33:11.114 --> 33:15.616
what some refer to
as cosmic geometry.

33:15.617 --> 33:19.578
HENRY: The Pyramid of the Sun at
Teotihuacan is at 19.5 degrees.

33:19.579 --> 33:23.666
So is Easter Island,
the hurricane belt.

33:23.667 --> 33:27.254
But most importantly,
the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii

33:27.255 --> 33:30.382
is also located at 19.5 degrees.

33:30.383 --> 33:34.385
NARRATOR: Perhaps even more profound
than the pattern found here on Earth

33:34.386 --> 33:37.972
is the one found on other
planets in our solar system.

33:37.973 --> 33:39.391
HENRY:
On Mars, for example,

33:39.392 --> 33:42.352
we find
the Mons Olympus volcano,

33:42.353 --> 33:44.062
the largest volcano
in our solar system,

33:44.063 --> 33:46.772
is located at 19.5 degrees.

33:46.773 --> 33:51.111
The giant Red Spot on Jupiter
is at 19.5 degrees.

33:51.112 --> 33:54.823
CAROLINE CORY: Everything in
the universe is geometric.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.909
Your physical body,
physical cells,

33:57.910 --> 34:01.413
the tree, the buildings,
everything is geometric.

34:02.749 --> 34:06.668
Sacred geometry is the pattern
in which these geometries

34:06.669 --> 34:11.630
are organized, according
to ratios and proportions.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.592
Now, when you say
something is organized,

34:14.594 --> 34:19.138
it implies that there is
a cosmic intelligence behind it.

34:19.139 --> 34:22.766
NARRATOR: One of the important
shapes in sacred geometry,

34:22.768 --> 34:27.105
and one that also has a
connection to the 19.5 latitude,

34:27.106 --> 34:31.109
is the three-sided pyramid
known as the tetrahedron.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.735
SALLA:
When you have two tetrahedrons

34:32.737 --> 34:35.654
inverted over one another,

34:35.655 --> 34:38.949
that forms a star tetrahedron.

34:38.951 --> 34:42.370
When we look at a star
tetrahedron and where it fits

34:42.371 --> 34:46.040
inside of a sphere, the vertices
of a star tetrahedron impact

34:46.041 --> 34:50.629
the sphere at 19.5 latitude
both north and south.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.672
And that is exactly where
the Big Island of Hawaii is

34:53.672 --> 34:56.634
in relationship
to the entire planet.

34:56.635 --> 34:59.638
CORY: Because of the
planet's geometry,

34:59.639 --> 35:02.808
you're going to have hot spots
that would be

35:02.809 --> 35:06.727
very strongly charged
in such a way

35:06.728 --> 35:11.482
that you could use
these hot spots to teleport

35:11.483 --> 35:14.527
from one point to the other.

35:14.528 --> 35:17.154
Or these hot spots could be used

35:17.155 --> 35:22.577
for intergalactic travel
or interplanetary travel.

35:24.746 --> 35:27.165
NARRATOR: Could sacred
geometry support the notion

35:27.166 --> 35:31.335
that Hawaii is perfectly
positioned to create portals...

35:31.336 --> 35:34.464
Portals that could not only
offer shortcuts

35:34.465 --> 35:36.341
to other parts of the world

35:36.342 --> 35:39.803
but also other parts
of the universe?

35:39.804 --> 35:43.890
For many native Hawaiians
and ancient astronaut theorists,

35:43.891 --> 35:47.268
the answer is a resounding yes,

35:47.269 --> 35:50.855
and they believe that
these portals have made Hawaii

35:50.856 --> 35:54.109
a virtual hub
of alien visitation,

35:54.110 --> 35:57.612
one that exists
even to this day.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.535
Pahoa, Hawaii.

36:03.536 --> 36:07.955
June 27, 2014.

36:07.956 --> 36:11.750
Hawaiian noble
Robert Kel'iiho'omalu,

36:11.751 --> 36:14.044
affectionately known
as Uncle Robert,

36:14.045 --> 36:16.714
opens the Star Visitor
Sanctuary,

36:16.715 --> 36:18.549
a dedicated landing site

36:18.550 --> 36:21.970
for extraterrestrials
visiting the Earth.

36:21.971 --> 36:25.015
Until his death in 2015,

36:25.016 --> 36:27.392
Uncle Robert stood
at the forefront

36:27.393 --> 36:30.227
of his people's efforts
to maintain contact

36:30.228 --> 36:32.230
with the star beings
who they believe

36:32.231 --> 36:35.442
are the Hawaiian people's
true ancestors.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.067
(singing in foreign language)

36:37.068 --> 36:39.613
NARRATOR:
Today his dream continues

36:39.614 --> 36:40.946
thanks to the efforts

36:40.947 --> 36:42.531
of people like his nephew-in-law

36:42.532 --> 36:44.491
Garry Hoffeld.

36:44.492 --> 36:45.951
Uncle Robert
was considered to be

36:45.952 --> 36:47.537
the konohiki of the area there.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.580
And there were other chiefs
in the area,

36:49.581 --> 36:51.332
but amongst those chiefs,

36:51.333 --> 36:53.667
they came to Uncle Robert
for guidance,

36:53.668 --> 36:56.671
and he was included
in-in every decision they made.

36:56.672 --> 37:00.091
NARRATOR:
In June 2019,

37:00.092 --> 37:02.551
ancient astronaut theorists
David Childress

37:02.552 --> 37:05.721
and Michael Salla arrive
in Pahoa.

37:05.722 --> 37:08.683
They are eager to get
a personal tour of the sanctuary

37:08.684 --> 37:11.018
and to hear a firsthand account

37:11.019 --> 37:13.647
of its history,
creation and mission.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.316
HOFFELD: Uncle Robert,
he was the prince of peace,

37:16.317 --> 37:18.651
and he thought that...
He called them

37:18.652 --> 37:20.277
our space brothers and sisters...

37:20.278 --> 37:22.863
He thought
they could certainly come down,

37:22.864 --> 37:25.158
and perhaps we should greet them
with some aloha

37:25.159 --> 37:27.451
instead of with guns pointed
at 'em like they might get

37:27.452 --> 37:29.328
someplace else in the world.

37:29.329 --> 37:32.832
So, he was thinking
that since the...

37:32.833 --> 37:35.459
space visitors had
originally come here to Hawaii,

37:35.460 --> 37:37.754
- they would come back. Is that the idea?
- Yeah, yeah.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.797
- Okay.
- Yeah. Do you want to come out into the...

37:39.798 --> 37:41.716
- the area we call the Star Sanctuary?
- Yeah. This is the...

37:41.717 --> 37:43.718
This is the sanctuary here,
right, inside here?

37:43.719 --> 37:45.053
HOFFELD:
Yeah, yeah.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.638
CHILDRESS: Right here
on the lava fields, huh?

37:46.639 --> 37:48.681
HOFFELD:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:48.682 --> 37:50.308
CHILDRESS:
Why did he choose

37:50.309 --> 37:52.185
this spot as the center

37:52.186 --> 37:54.020
for the Star Visitor Sanctuary,
right here?

37:54.021 --> 37:55.689
Well, yeah,
the whole lava field,

37:55.690 --> 37:58.817
uh, creates a kind of new
magnetic field out here.

37:58.818 --> 38:01.276
But this area
was actually very special,

38:01.277 --> 38:02.861
and it could be a place

38:02.862 --> 38:05.739
for the star visitors
to be welcomed

38:05.740 --> 38:08.493
and that they would be
given sanctuary

38:08.494 --> 38:11.162
because the Hawaii Kingdom
claims sovereignty

38:11.163 --> 38:12.622
to this whole land

38:12.623 --> 38:14.915
and which would be
the first time

38:14.916 --> 38:16.834
in our modern history

38:16.835 --> 38:20.337
that a sovereign entity
has granted extraterrestrials

38:20.338 --> 38:23.008
the right to land
in peace and harmony.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.176
NARRATOR:
To many Hawaiians,

38:25.177 --> 38:28.346
the Star Visitor Sanctuary
serves as an homage

38:28.347 --> 38:31.016
to their otherworldly origins.

38:32.434 --> 38:35.395
But, if a number
of recent reports are true,

38:35.396 --> 38:38.105
could it already be receiving

38:38.106 --> 38:41.110
extraterrestrial visitors?

38:46.949 --> 38:48.783
T astronaut theorists

38:48.784 --> 38:50.368
David Childress
and Michael Salla

38:50.369 --> 38:52.370
are at the Star Visitor
Sanctuary

38:52.371 --> 38:54.580
on Hawaii's Big Island.

38:54.581 --> 38:56.957
With them is Garry Hoffeld,

38:56.958 --> 38:59.669
a member of the Lawful
Hawaiian Government

38:59.670 --> 39:02.379
who was involved
in the sanctuary's founding

39:02.380 --> 39:04.883
and helps to oversee the site.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.093
CHILDRESS:
So, since you started

39:07.094 --> 39:09.721
this Star Visitor Sanctuary,

39:09.722 --> 39:13.223
has there been
some unusual activities

39:13.224 --> 39:15.602
or incidents here,
uh, that you've seen?

39:15.603 --> 39:18.395
Um, the day we set this up,
just before it got dark,

39:18.396 --> 39:20.314
several people
were sitting out here,

39:20.315 --> 39:22.274
and up in the distance
on the hill up here,

39:22.275 --> 39:24.026
they said they saw light orbs

39:24.027 --> 39:26.404
come out of the lava flow
right there above the ridge,

39:26.405 --> 39:28.781
come across the sky
and do a little bit of a hula,

39:28.782 --> 39:31.241
and then, off into the distance,
shot off.

39:31.242 --> 39:32.660
- And, I mean...
- Wow.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.995
Probably 30 people
were here seeing it,

39:34.996 --> 39:37.499
and the next day,
the lava started flowing again.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.709
So, they felt this was a sign

39:39.710 --> 39:41.794
from the-the star visitors

39:41.795 --> 39:43.504
that they were glad
the Star Visitors Sanctuary...

39:43.505 --> 39:46.758
Perhaps validation of what we're
doing. Perhaps coincidence.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.218
But I do believe
that there's a portal

39:48.219 --> 39:50.761
hanging out
in this particular area opening

39:50.762 --> 39:52.971
to different places,
and why not open here

39:52.972 --> 39:54.556
because we've opened
a place to do it

39:54.557 --> 39:55.975
rather than someplace else.

39:55.976 --> 39:57.852
Well, this is
a pretty amazing spot

39:57.853 --> 39:59.229
and quite fascinating.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.105
Thanks for bringing me here,
Michael,

40:01.106 --> 40:03.732
- and-and thank you, Garry, for all this.
- Oh, thank you.

40:03.733 --> 40:05.067
I'm glad to share.

40:05.068 --> 40:07.027
NARRATOR:
Could it be

40:07.028 --> 40:09.363
that the beings
the native Hawaiians refer to

40:09.364 --> 40:11.448
as their star ancestors

40:11.449 --> 40:15.412
have come here to Earth
by means of a space-time portal?

40:15.413 --> 40:18.455
For many
ancient astronaut theorists,

40:18.456 --> 40:21.042
the answer is yes.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.837
And for them
and for many Hawaiian natives,

40:23.838 --> 40:26.506
the Star Visitor Sanctuary
represents

40:26.507 --> 40:30.468
an important step
in their quest to make contact

40:30.469 --> 40:33.888
with extraterrestrial
civilizations.

40:33.889 --> 40:38.058
The idea that Hawaii
is building a welcome center

40:38.059 --> 40:40.477
for extraterrestrials
is incredible

40:40.478 --> 40:43.272
because their entire legends

40:43.273 --> 40:46.192
are based
on so-called star lore,

40:46.193 --> 40:50.821
that their origins
are in the stars.

40:50.822 --> 40:53.950
They themselves have said
that they are

40:53.951 --> 40:58.830
a direct offspring
of the extraterrestrials.

40:58.831 --> 41:02.875
And they are yearning
for their return.

41:02.876 --> 41:06.296
Among many Hawaiian groups,
there's the belief

41:06.297 --> 41:08.257
that they were
the original people.

41:09.257 --> 41:11.134
They were the kind of gateway

41:11.135 --> 41:14.596
for the gods to come
and seed planet Earth

41:14.597 --> 41:15.930
with their progeny,

41:15.931 --> 41:17.848
and that's consistent
with the idea

41:17.849 --> 41:20.685
that the Hawaiian Island

41:20.686 --> 41:23.605
is a critical
portal energy point

41:23.606 --> 41:26.774
for these extraterrestrials
from distant star systems

41:26.775 --> 41:28.192
such as the Pleiades.

41:28.193 --> 41:31.738
It was a portal
for the Pleiadians

41:31.739 --> 41:34.782
to send their people
to the Earth.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.705
They was with us before,

41:40.706 --> 41:43.000
they are with us now,
and will be for us forever.

41:47.003 --> 41:49.046
NARRATOR:
Do the Hawaiian Islands

41:49.047 --> 41:51.924
offer a profound connection
to the stars,

41:51.925 --> 41:55.136
a gateway through which
extraterrestrials

41:55.137 --> 41:59.015
have been entering our world
for centuries?

41:59.016 --> 42:01.225
Perhaps.

42:01.226 --> 42:05.480
But if such an audacious notion
turns out to be true,

42:05.481 --> 42:09.442
how long will it be
before we learn how to use

42:09.443 --> 42:11.902
these incredible portals
for ourselves

42:11.903 --> 42:15.739
to take our own journeys
to other worlds

42:15.740 --> 42:19.744
and to colonize
the very universe?
