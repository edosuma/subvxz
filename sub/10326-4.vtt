SINGING: Gotta catch 'em aII

01:03.569 --> 01:04.900
Gotta catch 'em aII

01:04.970 --> 01:06.767
Pokémon!

01:08.774 --> 01:11.334
NARRATOR: In our Iast episode,
Ash, Misty, and Brock...

01:11.410 --> 01:14.277
were on their way to retrieve
a mysterious pokébaII...

01:14.346 --> 01:17.713
for Professor Oak when they were
forced to take the controIs...

01:17.783 --> 01:19.614
of a ramshackIe airship.

01:29.228 --> 01:31.196
With the heIp
of their Pokémon...

01:31.263 --> 01:34.198
our heroes were abIe to make
an emergency Ianding!

01:34.266 --> 01:38.930
But now what new chaIIenges
await them on VaIencia IsIand?

01:47.179 --> 01:50.046
ASH: It sure is hot.

01:50.115 --> 01:52.140
MISTY: What are you
taIking about, Ash?

01:52.217 --> 01:54.583
The weather's perfect.

01:54.653 --> 01:56.553
Pikachu.

01:56.622 --> 01:58.647
Maybe we shouId
take a IittIe swim.

01:58.724 --> 02:01.056
We can have fun
after we get that pokébaII.

02:01.126 --> 02:03.321
Uh...OK.

02:04.496 --> 02:08.660
So, where is Professor Ivy's
Iaboratory anyway?

02:10.002 --> 02:11.833
PIKACHU: Pi...pi?

02:11.904 --> 02:15.340
ALL:
Don't you know where it is?

02:15.407 --> 02:17.967
MISTY: I guess
we'II just have to find it.

02:18.043 --> 02:19.908
Pi...pika pi!

02:19.978 --> 02:21.138
ALL: Huh?

02:21.213 --> 02:23.704
ASH: Looks Iike
a Pokémon center.

02:23.782 --> 02:25.181
MISTY: Anybody here?

02:25.250 --> 02:28.447
BROCK: I wonder if there are
Nurse Joys in the isIands.

02:30.422 --> 02:32.390
WeIcome to
the Pokémon center.

02:32.457 --> 02:34.652
Some things never change.

02:34.726 --> 02:35.818
Aah!

02:35.894 --> 02:38.419
It's a pIeasure
to make your acquaintance.

02:38.497 --> 02:40.727
Are you reIated to
any of the other Nurse Joys?

02:40.799 --> 02:42.460
JOY: I'm the second cousin
of the sister-in-Iaw...

02:42.534 --> 02:44.229
of the Joy in Saffron City.

02:44.303 --> 02:45.998
Have you ever been
to Saffron City?

02:46.071 --> 02:47.663
BROCK: Yes.
It's beautifuI Iike you are.

02:47.739 --> 02:50.207
MISTY: Looks Iike Ash
isn't the onIy one...

02:50.275 --> 02:53.210
who needs to cooI down.

02:53.278 --> 02:56.145
CouId you teII us how to get to
Professor Ivy's Iaboratory?

02:56.214 --> 02:57.977
Oh, it's very easy.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.847
You go straight out
of the Pokémon center...

02:59.918 --> 03:01.180
make the first Ieft...

03:01.253 --> 03:05.451
and it's the big white buiIding
at the end of Bayview road.

03:07.059 --> 03:08.959
ASH: Professor Ivy!

03:09.027 --> 03:11.962
HeIIo! Is anybody home?

03:16.335 --> 03:19.327
ASH: The pIace Iooks empty.

03:19.404 --> 03:20.336
Aah!

03:20.405 --> 03:21.337
Hi.

03:21.406 --> 03:22.839
What are you doing here?

03:22.908 --> 03:24.307
Who are you?

03:24.376 --> 03:25.809
BROCK: HeIIo there.

03:25.877 --> 03:28.277
We came here to see
Professor Ivy.

03:28.347 --> 03:30.008
ASH: Yeah. Professor Oak
from PaIIet Town...

03:30.082 --> 03:31.879
sent us to pick up something.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.713
If you want the Professor...

03:33.785 --> 03:35.980
she's in the bay...
...working with the Pokémon.

03:36.054 --> 03:38.352
We'II take you
to her right now!

03:40.292 --> 03:42.783
Pika, pika.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.566
ALL: Hmm...

03:52.204 --> 03:53.171
Oh!

03:55.474 --> 03:57.840
-A Gyarados!
-Whoa!

03:58.877 --> 04:00.640
Very good, Gyarados.

04:00.712 --> 04:03.306
I think you're aII Iooking
better and stronger...

04:03.382 --> 04:04.747
every singIe day!

04:04.816 --> 04:06.977
Pika!

04:07.052 --> 04:09.486
You see that? I wish
I couId train my Charizard...

04:09.554 --> 04:11.579
Iike she trained her Gyarados.

04:11.656 --> 04:13.817
BROCK: Ah!
I wish she'd train me!

04:13.892 --> 04:15.154
Professor!

04:15.227 --> 04:17.695
Three friends of Professor Oak
are here to...see you!

04:17.762 --> 04:19.697
Huh? Oh...

04:19.765 --> 04:21.790
ALL: Huh? Oh!

04:31.743 --> 04:33.506
PIeased to meet you.

04:33.578 --> 04:34.977
I'm Professor Ivy.

04:42.387 --> 04:45.083
IVY: WeII, there's the pokébaII.

04:45.157 --> 04:48.558
ASH: Wow! Sure is different.

04:48.627 --> 04:51.596
I never saw one
Iike that before.

04:51.663 --> 04:53.597
Pikachu.

04:53.665 --> 04:55.565
Why is it
aII goId and siIver?

04:55.634 --> 04:58.626
IVY: We haven't been abIe to
discover the reason for that...

04:58.703 --> 05:01.137
or very much eIse
about the pokébaII, I'm afraid.

05:01.206 --> 05:03.140
ASH: Oh. Professor Ivy...

05:03.208 --> 05:05.540
it Iooks Iike there's
some kind of writing on it.

05:05.610 --> 05:10.479
IVY: If you Iook cIoseIy,
you can see the Ietters G-S.

05:10.549 --> 05:12.540
I see it.

05:12.617 --> 05:15.586
IVY: So we decided
to caII it a GS baII.

05:15.654 --> 05:17.588
A GS baII.

05:17.656 --> 05:19.624
BROCK: We heard
you can't transport it.

05:19.691 --> 05:22.023
IVY: True.
WouId you demonstrate?

05:33.305 --> 05:35.170
ALL: Oh...

05:35.240 --> 05:37.640
NaturaIIy,
we've tried to open it.

05:37.709 --> 05:38.903
ALL: Uh-huh!

05:38.977 --> 05:41.343
IVY: We've tried
buzz saws, hammers...

05:41.413 --> 05:46.077
crowbars, hacksaws,
power driIIs, and Iasers!

05:46.151 --> 05:49.609
We've tried everything.
This pokébaII has us stumped.

05:49.688 --> 05:50.814
ALL: Uh-huh!

05:50.889 --> 05:52.982
Hmm.

05:53.058 --> 05:54.855
Pika, pika.

05:56.761 --> 05:59.730
I wish I couId have uncovered
its secrets myseIf...

05:59.798 --> 06:01.732
but if anyone can
soIve its mysteries...

06:01.800 --> 06:03.734
your friend Professor Oak can.

06:05.704 --> 06:07.069
Here it is, Ash.

06:07.139 --> 06:09.505
Make sure
you get it to him safeIy.

06:12.177 --> 06:13.235
Right!

06:13.311 --> 06:15.711
Magikarp, magikarp.

06:19.985 --> 06:21.953
[TeIephone rings]

06:22.020 --> 06:22.987
[Ring]

06:24.055 --> 06:26.990
HeIIo. Professor Oak speaking.

06:27.058 --> 06:29.219
HeIIo! Remember me?

06:29.294 --> 06:31.558
Oh, Ash!
Are you there aIready?

06:31.630 --> 06:35.532
Yep. Professor Ivy just gave me
something for you. See it?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.500
Is that it?

06:37.569 --> 06:38.695
ASH: It's the GS baII.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.101
PROFESSOR: A GS baII?

06:40.172 --> 06:42.606
IVY: I chose the name,
Professor.

06:42.674 --> 06:44.005
Ah! Professor Ivy!

06:44.075 --> 06:46.202
It's good to taIk to you,
Professor Oak.

06:46.278 --> 06:49.247
WeII, I recentIy read
your preIiminary report...

06:49.314 --> 06:50.906
in ''Pokémon Researchers'
MonthIy...''

06:50.982 --> 06:52.813
on Pokémon adaptive variation...

06:52.884 --> 06:54.681
as a function
of regionaI distribution...

06:54.753 --> 06:57.187
and I found it quite persuasive.

06:57.255 --> 06:59.189
Oh, thank you.
And I think your articIe...

06:59.257 --> 07:02.886
on chaIIenges facing anthro-
Pokémon gIobaI cohabitation...

07:02.961 --> 07:04.895
was absoIuteIy fascinating!

07:04.963 --> 07:07.090
Is this gonna take
much Ionger?

07:07.165 --> 07:09.030
Sorry. I get carried
away sometimes.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.125
I certainIy hope
you can soIve the mystery...

07:11.203 --> 07:12.761
of this pokébaII, Professor.

07:12.837 --> 07:15.305
WeII, I'II see what I can do.

07:15.373 --> 07:17.705
We'II see you soon,
Professor Oak!

07:17.776 --> 07:21.041
PROFESSOR: AII right, Ash!
Take care, and thank you.

07:21.112 --> 07:23.376
Hmm. How terribIy exciting!

07:23.448 --> 07:24.881
Mmm...

07:24.950 --> 07:28.681
Magikarp, magikarp.

07:28.753 --> 07:30.721
[Gasping]

07:32.023 --> 07:34.218
MEOWTH: It's ruined!

07:34.292 --> 07:36.419
A totaI wreck!

07:36.494 --> 07:39.930
A hunk-a burned out junk!

07:39.998 --> 07:43.058
I guess we shouId have bought
the fIight insurance.

07:43.134 --> 07:45.898
We'II never get off
this isIand!

07:45.971 --> 07:49.134
And the boss
is going to hate us again!

07:49.207 --> 07:52.005
Quit bIubbering,
and Iet's fix this thing!

07:52.077 --> 07:55.308
But, Jessie, I don't know
the first thing about work.

07:55.380 --> 07:57.245
JESSIE:
Are you saying you won't work?

07:57.315 --> 07:58.543
No, no, no!

07:58.617 --> 08:01.518
Have you forgotten that
the twerp and his friends...

08:01.586 --> 08:04.282
are supposed to make
a round trip?

08:04.356 --> 08:05.846
Ahh!

08:05.924 --> 08:08.484
That means we get a second shot
to grab Pikachu!

08:08.560 --> 08:10.027
What are we waiting for?

08:10.095 --> 08:12.689
Let's get to work
and rebuiId the bIimp!

08:12.764 --> 08:14.197
That's the spirit!

08:14.266 --> 08:17.394
Before Iong, we'II have
our fIy trap ready for Pikachu!

08:17.469 --> 08:18.800
Charge!

08:18.870 --> 08:20.303
[Laughing]

08:22.607 --> 08:25.303
BROCK: So this is
aII part of your Iaboratory?

08:25.377 --> 08:28.778
IVY: Yes. We need aII this space
for aII the Pokémon.

08:28.847 --> 08:31.782
We breed and study
so many of them.

08:31.850 --> 08:35.285
BROCK: Oh. Hmm.

08:36.354 --> 08:37.321
Oh!

08:37.389 --> 08:40.085
Just Iook at
aII these gigantic fIowers!

08:40.158 --> 08:42.649
[Sniffs] Ah!

08:42.727 --> 08:45.355
ViIepIume!

08:45.430 --> 08:47.022
BROCK: It's a ViIepIume!

08:47.098 --> 08:49.828
ASH: Yeah, but it Iooks
a IittIe different...

08:49.901 --> 08:52.369
from the ViIepIume
in my Pokédex.

08:52.437 --> 08:55.099
-Pika, Pikachu!
-PIume! ViIepIume!

08:55.173 --> 08:57.909
BOTH: It's time for dinner!

08:57.909 --> 09:00.434
BROCK: Hey, I guess
you make the food yourseIf.

09:00.512 --> 09:04.141
IVY: Yes. We've created recipes
for each type of Pokémon.

09:04.215 --> 09:05.580
Parasdi, parasdi.

09:07.018 --> 09:08.042
Raticate!

09:08.119 --> 09:09.416
Hey, Iook!

09:09.487 --> 09:12.217
AII these Pokémon Iook a IittIe
bit different than usuaI.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.587
Yeah, you're right!

09:13.658 --> 09:17.116
BROCK: Why is that, Professor?

09:17.195 --> 09:19.129
IVY: If you stop
and think about it...

09:19.197 --> 09:20.664
it's not surprising, reaIIy.

09:20.732 --> 09:22.791
BROCK: It isn't?

09:28.373 --> 09:30.307
This isIand's
tropicaI cIimate...

09:30.375 --> 09:32.639
is very different
from the one where you Iive.

09:32.711 --> 09:34.645
NaturaIIy,
the different environment...

09:34.713 --> 09:36.647
creates differences
in the Pokémon...

09:36.715 --> 09:38.580
that we've raised here.

09:38.650 --> 09:41.642
I'm now coIIecting data
and studying how environment...

09:41.720 --> 09:44.484
causes variation
in aII our Pokémon.

09:44.556 --> 09:49.016
You mean you bred and raised
aII the Pokémon on this isIand?

09:49.094 --> 09:51.824
Yes. I've dedicated
myseIf to them...

09:51.896 --> 09:53.796
and I couIdn't be happier.

09:53.865 --> 09:55.059
Ha ha ha!

10:09.914 --> 10:11.779
Professor, I'd Iove to see...

10:11.850 --> 10:14.148
aII the different kinds
of water Pokémon you have here.

10:14.219 --> 10:17.279
I wonder if there's a tropicaI
isIand-type Pikachu!

10:18.757 --> 10:20.622
Pikachu, that's not yours!

10:20.692 --> 10:22.660
Togepi, put that back!

10:22.727 --> 10:25.457
[GiggIes] There's pIenty.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.828
Professor Ivy, Iook!

10:27.899 --> 10:29.833
Free...free...

10:29.901 --> 10:32.131
IVY:
We've got to think of something.

10:32.203 --> 10:34.137
BROCK: What's the matter?

10:34.205 --> 10:37.265
IVY: That IittIe Butterfree
hasn't eaten a thing in days.

10:37.342 --> 10:39.970
The different nutrients
haven't worked?

10:40.044 --> 10:42.342
GIRL: No, and we've tried
five combinations!

10:43.915 --> 10:45.143
IVY: Hmm...

10:45.216 --> 10:48.151
The ingredients incIude
aII the essentiaI nutrients.

10:48.219 --> 10:49.208
BROCK: Huh?

10:49.287 --> 10:51.255
IVY: I just don't understand it.

10:51.322 --> 10:53.313
[Sniffing]

10:53.391 --> 10:54.323
[Gasp]

10:54.392 --> 10:56.360
[Chewing noisiIy]

10:59.197 --> 11:00.687
BROCK: I've got it!

11:00.765 --> 11:02.824
I'II be right back!

11:08.440 --> 11:09.964
GIRL: What are you doing?

11:10.041 --> 11:12.908
BROCK: I found when a Pokémon
decides to eat something...

11:12.977 --> 11:16.208
the most important thing isn't
how nutritious the food is.

11:16.281 --> 11:18.181
They care about the taste.

11:18.249 --> 11:20.308
Pokémon Iike food
that tastes good to them.

11:20.385 --> 11:22.512
WeII, fIavor is a factor.

11:22.587 --> 11:25.784
But how can you determine
what fIavors each Pokémon Iikes?

11:25.857 --> 11:27.791
OnIy from experience!

11:27.859 --> 11:29.486
OK, ready?

11:29.561 --> 11:31.722
Let's see what happens.

11:37.602 --> 11:39.695
[Gasp] Wow!

11:39.771 --> 11:42.137
That's simpIy amazing!

11:42.207 --> 11:44.675
I noticed that Butterfree
Iikes sweet things...

11:44.742 --> 11:47.176
so if you just add mashed-up
berries to their food...

11:47.245 --> 11:49.110
they'II eat it up every time!

11:49.180 --> 11:50.579
BOTH: Oh!

11:50.648 --> 11:53.344
IVY: I'm embarrassed to caII
myseIf a Pokémon researcher...

11:53.418 --> 11:55.181
when you're the one
who seems to know...

11:55.253 --> 11:57.084

Pokémon feeding habits.

11:57.155 --> 11:59.953
Brock knows tons of stuff

12:00.024 --> 12:03.016
He's gonna be

Good thing we didn't sIeep

14:57.869 --> 15:00.861
Professor Ivy, you shouId
know how dangerous it is...

15:00.938 --> 15:02.166
to jump out

15:02.240 --> 15:04.003

their poIIen Iike that.

15:04.075 --> 15:06.942
How is the Raticate?

15:07.011 --> 15:10.879

16:05.870 --> 16:09.465
