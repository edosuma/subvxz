01:40.684 --> 01:43.645
The boomslang was stolen
from the zoo last night.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.398
It's extremely dangerous.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.307
Father.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.895
Any news on my grandson?

02:28.857 --> 02:29.857
No change.

02:31.443 --> 02:32.569
He hasn't woken up.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.740
A father's job is to protect his family.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.118
When wataru was on that roof...

02:42.621 --> 02:44.540
When he was pushed...

02:47.793 --> 02:49.211
Where was his father?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.176
Wataru is lucky.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.722
You never know what horrible fate

03:01.557 --> 03:03.433
your bad luck has saved you from.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.151
Thank you for taking the job
on such short notice.

03:54.234 --> 03:58.030
I am ready. You are getting
the new and improved me.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.424
Since I've been working with Barry,

03:59.448 --> 04:04.244
I am experiencing a calm
like never before. Never.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.246
Like, I'm less reactive to situations,

04:06.330 --> 04:08.081
I'm more accepting
of people's shortcomings.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.835
I was a little uncertain about coming
back to work, but it's like Barry says:

04:11.919 --> 04:14.588
You put peace out in the world,
you get peace back.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.589
I think your new therapist
might be forgetting

04:16.673 --> 04:18.591
what you do for a living, little ladybug.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.304
- Ladybug?
- Your new operational name.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.973
- Ladybug? Really?
- You don't like it?

04:25.057 --> 04:26.391
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.976
Well, if you like it, all right.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.231
Oh, I see what you're doing.
Ladybugs are supposed to be lucky.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.614
- You don't have bad luck.
- Really?

04:42.157 --> 04:46.578
My bad luck is biblical. I'm not even
trying to kill people and someone dies.

04:46.662 --> 04:47.704
That's an exaggeration.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.623
It is? My last job?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.875
- The political blackmail photos?
- I voted for you.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.461
Remember the suicidal bellboy
climbed the roof of his hotel,

04:54.586 --> 04:55.921
couldn't take it anymore?

05:00.884 --> 05:02.970
Seems more like his bad luck
than yours.

05:04.763 --> 05:05.681
Hang in there, buddy!

05:05.764 --> 05:07.307
And he didn't die.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.643
Okay? You drove him to the hospital.
It's good luck.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.562
- All in how you frame it.
- Sure.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.147
Gotta say I like it here.
I could live here.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.860
I like the atmosphere,
the people are considerate...

05:21.029 --> 05:22.698
Except for that guy.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.344
Why is this job paying so well?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.596
It was supposed to be carver's,
but he's got some stomach thing.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.706
- Carver?
- And he doesn't do snatch-and-grabs.

05:30.789 --> 05:34.293
I'm filling in for carver?
You picked me second to carver?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.670
You said you wanted simple
for your first job back.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.963
Doesn't get simpler.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.007
- Shit.
- Shit what?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.485
I think I must have lost the key
when that guy bumped into me.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.845
- What's the number again?
- 523.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.021
Carver.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.564
What an ego.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.109
I mean, talk about
a candidate for self-improvement.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.653
Calling in sick?
I mean, what is that, high school?

06:02.112 --> 06:03.572
I can hear that personal growth.

06:03.655 --> 06:07.326
I know I'm being judgmental.
I need to work on that.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.703
But, Jesus, what a douchebag.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.289
You have the strangest requests.
Firecrackers?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.457
I'm industrious.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.503
Please tell me
you didn't order the sleeping powder.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.420
Nope.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.773
You almost gave that bodyguard
in Anchorage a heart attack.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.341
I've worked on the dosage.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.050
Take the gun.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.270
Ticket please.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.359
Thank you for using our train.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.944
First class is that way.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.032
- I'm gonna assume you didn't take the gun?
- Barry says every conflict

06:47.157 --> 06:49.826
is an opportunity for a peaceful...
What was it?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.704
And your handler says
some conflicts require a gun.

06:52.788 --> 06:53.788
Shit.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.173
Okay, I'm on.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.383
Well, that's a start.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.219
Hey, this is nice.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.302
Economy?

07:08.637 --> 07:12.057
I'm thinking of starting my own agency.
You know, all simple jobs, all the time.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.642
That's a terrible business plan.

07:13.725 --> 07:17.563
No more sociopaths, no more maniacs.
Just quality people.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.148
Barry says it's time for some change.
I think he's right.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.359
Barry does not know
what you do for a living.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.945
Okay, here we go.
The bullet train has 16 cars.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.989
Ten economy, six first-class,

07:27.072 --> 07:29.449
and remember,
only one minute stop at every station.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.166
Bloody fuckin' hell. Do you mind?

07:39.835 --> 07:41.879
What is he, fucking blind or something?

07:44.006 --> 07:47.092
Come on. No, you don't
have to Nick the biscuits, man.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.679
Oh, no. You all right? Okay, cool.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.222
- Fucking asshole.
- Thank you.

07:53.557 --> 07:54.808
Why'd I do that?

07:54.933 --> 07:57.579
It's like I got a compulsion or something.
I have to take it if I see it.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.563
Need to talk to someone. Serious.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.524
A goldfish biscuit?
I mean, I don't understand it.

08:02.608 --> 08:06.153
Okay, simple snatch-and-grab.
What am I snatching and/or grabbing?

08:06.236 --> 08:09.698
A briefcase. Intel says
there's a train sticker on the handle.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.576
Briefcases have owners.
Owners are not simple.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.329
And the last update says
the owners will be in economy class.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.832
Owners, plural?
Why didn't you tell me to bring that gun?

08:18.957 --> 08:21.293
I did.
You chose spiritual enlightenment.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.795
Chiketto, please.

08:23.879 --> 08:24.879
Ticket.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.506
Hold on.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.134
Ah, no, no. Receipt.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.389
Shit, I think I dropped my ticket, too.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.727
That receipt shows
I bought a ticket, though, right?

08:41.980 --> 08:42.980
One stop.

08:43.815 --> 08:44.815
Yep.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.698
I thought they bowed here.

08:59.414 --> 09:02.626
I pushed him. First class, seat b4

09:26.984 --> 09:29.653
Sorry, kid. I'm looking for...

09:37.411 --> 09:38.495
You found her.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.542
- Oh, lemon.
- Tangerine.

09:43.625 --> 09:44.751
You're bleeding, mate.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.296
Oh, mate, shit. Oh, shit, man.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.380
Who the fuck did I kill?

09:48.463 --> 09:50.483
- Get a wet one on it or something.
- It's not mine, mate.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.193
- Oh, it's not yours?
- Yeah. I don't bleed.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.821
In that case, leave your jacket open,
let everyone have a good old look.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.323
- Yeah, I want everyone to see my tie.
- Fuck is wrong with you?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.467
Pull your coat together
so no one else notices, lemon.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.727
I think they'll notice
the childish code names first.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.521
But if we're gonna stick with fruit,
why not apple or orange?

10:05.397 --> 10:06.607
So, what's in this case?

10:06.690 --> 10:08.066
Are we doing this?

10:08.150 --> 10:09.860
You know what's in the case.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.695
Money. It's always money.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.530
Tangerines are sophisticated.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.175
Now he's callin' a fruit sophisticated.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.926
Yeah, it's cross-hybridized
with other fruit.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.536
They're adaptable. Like me.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.623
You said six cars in economy,

10:22.706 --> 10:25.542
say 30 passengers per car,

10:25.626 --> 10:29.505
guessing two bags per,
let's see, times two and you carry...

10:29.588 --> 10:32.216
Yeah, no fuckin' way
I'm gonna find one brie...

10:33.175 --> 10:34.176
- Wait.
- What?

10:34.259 --> 10:35.737
- Train sticker on the handle?
- Yeah.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.179
Holy shitbox.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.601
- And why am I lemon?
- Because you're sour.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.524
- No one likes lemons.
- That's bollocks, mate.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.603
Lemonades, lemon drops.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.290
- You got a sore throat?
- Lemon meringue pie.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.525
When's the last time
you ate lemon meringue pie?

10:49.608 --> 10:52.128
- Lemon drizzle cake.
- I'm sorry, are you talking about lemons?

10:52.694 --> 10:54.696
- I have the case.
- Well, that's great.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.114
- Is it?
- Yes.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.991
- What's the catch?
- There is a no catch.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.410
- There's always a catch.
- Get off the train.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.164
Quite like lemons. I just hate code names.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.460
Oh, well, look at this. Sleeping beauty.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.713
- Wakey, wakey.
- Eggs and bakey.

11:13.966 --> 11:14.966
Where am I?

11:21.765 --> 11:24.268
You're safe now. Your father sent us.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.270
You idiots work for my father?

11:26.353 --> 11:29.356
Ooh, easy, we could deliver you
back to your pops in a box.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.401
Technically, we're outside contractors.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.195
I'm tangerine. He's lemon.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.197
Like the fruit?

11:40.784 --> 11:42.911
- You ever watch Thomas the tank engine?
- Here we go.

11:42.995 --> 11:45.956
Hey, you watch something nowadays,
what is it, huh? Nothing.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.041
It's twists, violence, drama, no message.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.294
What's the point? Huh?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.129
What are we supposed to learn?

11:52.212 --> 11:55.424
Everything I learned about people
I learned from Thomas.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.361
- You bring your sticker book, did ya?
- You know I always bring my stickers.

11:58.385 --> 12:02.222
Take tangerine here.
He's a Gordon. This blue one.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.516
And Gordon is the strongest,
the most important.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.518
But he doesn't always listen to others.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.520
What's that, now?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.939
I mean, some people are Edwards.
Wise, kind.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.942
Some are Henrys.
Hard-working, strong.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.320
Some people are diesels.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.529
Fuck me!

12:19.865 --> 12:20.991
Those are trouble.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.367
You, though...

12:23.493 --> 12:26.788
Yeah, you seem like a Percy.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.248
Young.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.083
Sweet.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.335
Not all there.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.171
You finished, both of you?

12:36.048 --> 12:38.091
- Yeah.
- Right. Your daddy

12:38.175 --> 12:40.778
hired us to get you out of the trouble
you got yourself into, naughty boy.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.430
- Why are you tangerine, though?
- Oh, it's sophisticated, mate.

12:43.514 --> 12:46.058
Oh, fuckin' hell.
It's not important, is it?

12:46.141 --> 12:48.560
What is important
are the 17 dead bodies we left

12:48.644 --> 12:50.330
getting you back from the triad
that kidnapped you

12:50.354 --> 12:52.540
with the plans to ransom you to your
extremely psychotic fucked-up father.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.815
Actually, it's 16.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.109
What's that, now?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.111
- Sixteen kills, mate.
- No, it was 17.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.988
- It's 16.
- Seven.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.466
You're startin' to get on my fucking tits.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.009
- Sixteen.
- I'll smash my fucking head

13:03.033 --> 13:04.761
- through a brick wall.
- Maybe that'd help your memory

13:04.785 --> 13:05.994
'cause it was 16.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.139
It was 17, goddamn it.
I wanna fucking strangle you now.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.603
Do you mind if we do this right now?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.045
One.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.759
Two, three.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.976
Five guys playing poker.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.032
Keep moving!

13:44.116 --> 13:45.534
- Big guy.
- Yeah, big guy.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.161
Sometime today!

13:50.205 --> 13:51.205
Ten.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.211
Three assholes with swords.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.505
Fucking get it. Fuck!

14:00.924 --> 14:01.943
Why do you always bring swords?

14:01.967 --> 14:03.635
Fucking triad. You would, wouldn't ya?

14:05.596 --> 14:06.805
You son of a bitch!

14:09.808 --> 14:10.934
I like swords, actually.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.914
Looks like it's time for a Jaffa cake.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.148
How about a wagon wheel?

14:16.231 --> 14:17.231
Oh, that works.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.276
Swing!

14:24.531 --> 14:25.699
Fourteen, fifteen.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.870
And the prick on the motorcycle.

14:37.669 --> 14:38.921
- So 16.
- You forgot the poor,

14:39.004 --> 14:41.131
- innocent civilian on the street.
- The fuck you...?

14:41.215 --> 14:44.343
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy, you okay? Oh, my...

14:46.261 --> 14:48.347
Shit. That wasn't our fault.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.765
- Wasn't our fault?
- No.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.743
Well, what would
Thomas the tank engine say, lemon?

14:51.767 --> 14:53.185
That's really mean.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.187
He'd say,
"hey, take responsibility, mate."

14:55.270 --> 14:56.688
He doesn't sound like that.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.275
Gonna put a little distance
between me and the owners.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.069
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.272
- You sound nervous.
- Because I am, in fact, nervous.

15:04.446 --> 15:07.074
Hey, listen,
I'm just gonna get off at the next stop.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.785
Oh, let's have a seat, then, huh?

15:09.868 --> 15:11.346
Do you know
what they call your papushka?

15:11.370 --> 15:12.538
Course I fucking do.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.790
The white death. Not exactly a fruit.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.124
No. There you go.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.852
There's a story...
Stop me if you've heard it.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.503
Where this woman found herself

15:19.586 --> 15:22.339
in the unfortunate position
of owing your father a tidy sum of money.

15:22.422 --> 15:26.051
Now, the issue was it took her
some time to acquire this money.

15:26.802 --> 15:29.304
But she did pay it back
five minutes late, didn't she?

15:29.388 --> 15:31.306
- Yeah, what'd he do?
- Cut her arm off.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.516
- Fuckin' hell!
- Yeah.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.439
He said she owed him a finger
for every minute.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.540
He's not a monster. He didn't
make her sit through it five times.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.107
He just cut once, didn't he?

15:43.569 --> 15:45.612
- This is too easy.
- You're overthinking it.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.456
- You're underthinking it.
- It's not a word.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.365
- Yes, it is.
- Really?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.241
I think it is.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.844
- Did you Google it?
- Doesn't matter.

15:50.868 --> 15:51.743
What would Barry say?

15:51.827 --> 15:54.621
Barry would say, "a negative outlook
leads to a negative outcome."

15:54.705 --> 15:56.748
Wow. How much do you pay him again?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.793
Our job is to keep you safe

15:59.877 --> 16:02.462
and to recover the briefcase
with the ransom money inside.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.507
And I plan on completin' my job
and keeping...

16:06.425 --> 16:08.302
Lemon. Where's the briefcase?

16:08.385 --> 16:09.928
Oh, I stashed it.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.806
The case, lemon.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.808
Go get me the fucking case.

16:15.434 --> 16:18.312
You're a liability, you know?
To my father.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.234
He doesn't need a reason
to kill people like you.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.861
He needs a reason not to.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.072
Does he have one?

16:32.492 --> 16:33.869
That's fucking confusin'.

16:34.912 --> 16:37.080
- Hello?
- Do you have white death's son?

16:37.164 --> 16:39.058
You mean this dickhead
with the silly face tattoos?

16:39.082 --> 16:40.685
- He's sat right here.
- And the briefcase?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.628
Yes, of course, I've got the case.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.672
You will both deboard at Kyoto station.

16:45.756 --> 16:48.258
Then your business with him
will be concluded.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.729
It was just here.

17:01.605 --> 17:02.814
Well, it's not anymore.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.858
We need to find
the person who took that case.

17:07.569 --> 17:08.737
Maybe you're right.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.823
Maybe my luck is starting to turn.

17:38.475 --> 17:39.893
You.

17:41.270 --> 17:42.270
Yes.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.313
Me.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.942
But you are yuichi kimura.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.571
And you came here to kill me.

17:51.864 --> 17:54.074
My parents call me malen'kiy prints.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.786
That means little prince.
Obviously, they wanted a boy.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.670
You're going to want
to hear the whole story.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.215
Or you'll be very, very sorry.

18:15.095 --> 18:15.971
It's the hospital.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.472
Hang on.

18:17.556 --> 18:20.475
Hi. Yes, you can see the boy now.

18:21.894 --> 18:25.272
Good. If you don't hear from me
every ten minutes

18:25.355 --> 18:27.316
or if I don't answer this phone
when you call,

18:28.400 --> 18:31.612
I want you to go in there and kill...

18:34.823 --> 18:37.117
I'm sorry, what's your boy's name again?

18:37.242 --> 18:38.535
Wataru.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.787
Right. Right.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.164
Kill wataru.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.710
Aren't we glad we waited?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.378
We got his son. That was our job.

18:48.462 --> 18:52.424
Our job was to come back
with his son and his $10 million.

18:52.508 --> 18:54.268
Three words describe
our situation right now.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.429
- Do you know what they are?
- Sure do. Saved... his... son.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.782
Family's more important
than money, right?

18:59.806 --> 19:02.434
Do you honestly not know
who the white death is?

19:02.518 --> 19:04.895
I know the white death.
You just told me 5 minutes ago.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.105
Why do I even bother
forwarding you the briefings?

19:07.981 --> 19:09.149
I do not know.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.991
The Japanese underworld
used to be ruled by a man named minegishi.

19:19.493 --> 19:23.038
Now, minegishi was one brutal bastard.

19:23.622 --> 19:24.998
But he was old-school, you know?

19:25.082 --> 19:27.125
Tradition and loyalty
was all that mattered to him.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.813
When you were in, you were in.
You were like family.

19:29.837 --> 19:31.797
He treated you
like you were one of his own.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.551
Then out of the blue comes this
6-foot-fucking-6 geezer from Russia.

19:36.677 --> 19:40.514
Whispers that he was exiled from the
Russian mafia or that he was ex-kgb.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.100
No one really knows the truth.

19:44.476 --> 19:47.229
But what is known is this Russian

19:48.480 --> 19:50.524
worked his way up the ranks.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.484
Bit by bit. Kill by kill.

19:54.319 --> 19:58.740
And very, very fucking quickly became
one of minegishi's closest advisors.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.076
And those loyal to him said:

20:01.159 --> 20:04.204
"Hold your horses.
This geezer ain't the full ticket.

20:04.288 --> 20:05.956
He ain't to be trusted."

20:06.915 --> 20:08.292
"He's dangerous," they said.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.460
"A modern plague," they said.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.629
"A white death."

20:13.672 --> 20:15.465
So, sure enough, they were right.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.510
He made his own alliance.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.180
His own gang.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.730
And what'd he do?

20:29.855 --> 20:31.356
Stabbed him in the back.

20:31.857 --> 20:34.484
I mean, metaphorically.
He blew his fucking brains out, didn't he?

20:46.413 --> 20:49.750
He wiped the name minegishi off
the face of the earth in one single night.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.794
And made an empire
worthy of the white death.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.677
So, let me put this bluntly.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.596
There's this soulless psychotic leader

21:02.679 --> 21:05.474
with the largest criminal organization
on the planet

21:05.557 --> 21:08.769
shoved right inside
our fucking ass cheeks.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.875
That motherfucker's
definitely a diesel, then, isn't he?

21:13.899 --> 21:16.151
If you mention Thomas the tank engine
one more time

21:16.235 --> 21:19.488
- I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking face.
- Okay, if he's such a badass,

21:19.571 --> 21:22.300
how come he hired two random operators
instead of getting his son back himself?

21:22.324 --> 21:24.552
If you actually read the briefings
you'd know that he had a wife.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.661
What, he had a wife?

21:25.744 --> 21:28.497
She was the most important
fucking thing in his life, and she died.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.020
Drunk driving accident or some shit.

21:31.834 --> 21:34.253
And now he's at the compound.
He ain't left since.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.606
An unnamed locomotive
might say there's a lesson to be learned.

21:36.630 --> 21:39.132
And he didn't hire
two random operators, lemon.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.300
No, he asked for the best.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.678
He asked for the two responsible
for the Bolivia job.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.645
He asked for pros who wouldn't fuck up.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.397
Three words, lemon.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.815
- We are...
- Fucked.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.904
What do you want?

22:01.446 --> 22:03.490
People think
that I'm just some young girl.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.911
Someone's future wife...

22:08.996 --> 22:10.163
Or future mother.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.543
But I'm not in someone else's story.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.046
You're all in mine.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.216
The fuck does that have to do with me?

22:21.300 --> 22:24.970
You work for the most feared boss
in the city: The white death.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.223
Oh, deny it all you want.

22:28.307 --> 22:31.727
But you work for someone who works
for someone else, et cetera, et cetera,

22:31.852 --> 22:34.396
and it all falls under the same person.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.982
You delivered a briefcase two days ago

22:37.107 --> 22:39.610
to one of the white death's associates,

22:39.693 --> 22:41.236
and I saw my opportunity.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.990
Follow the case and find the white death.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.284
I don't know
what you think I can do for you.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.995
Oh, that is my favorite part of the story.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.039
You're going to kill him for me.

22:53.916 --> 22:57.419
How the fuck
am I going to kill the white death?

22:58.086 --> 22:59.213
You'll see.

23:01.590 --> 23:02.633
Oh, look at that.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.510
We are right on schedule.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.847
Sit back, relax a little bit.
You look so tense.

23:22.319 --> 23:24.446
We rescued his fucking son.

23:25.197 --> 23:27.991
We find the fucker who took the briefcase,
make things right,

23:28.075 --> 23:29.826
be like it never happened.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.478
You still got that vest on ya?

23:38.502 --> 23:40.921
No, vests give you
a false sense of security.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.607
You might, like, get shot in the neck.

23:42.631 --> 23:44.716
It also stops you
from getting shot in the chest,

23:44.842 --> 23:46.718
but I guess you missed
that episode of Thomas.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.389
I really must've,
because that sounds dark as shit.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.641
Nut up or shut up, bruv.

24:06.905 --> 24:09.449
Well, so, slight change of plans.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.502
First his wife, now his son?

24:21.253 --> 24:22.880
That's a lot of white deaths.

24:31.597 --> 24:35.142
I want you to be strong, son.
Do you understand?

24:35.976 --> 24:37.436
Be strong.

26:35.554 --> 26:36.554
My heart.

27:13.926 --> 27:15.302
No!

27:23.519 --> 27:26.855
Find me the son of a bitch who did this.

28:25.831 --> 28:28.292
You lucky son of a bitch.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.626
You stabbed me?!

28:31.712 --> 28:34.590
- You ruined my life.
- I don't even know you!

28:39.803 --> 28:41.513
I come here for revenge.

28:42.264 --> 28:45.517
The assassin who killed El saguaro
killed my wife.

28:46.435 --> 28:49.313
But fate made this a two for one special.

28:58.155 --> 29:02.117
Can we just take a time-out here?
Talk this out?

29:02.201 --> 29:03.827
I will never stop coming for you.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.078
What?

29:05.162 --> 29:07.706
Run as far as you like.
I will find you.

29:07.789 --> 29:08.665
Why?

29:08.749 --> 29:12.002
And I will ruin your life
the way you ruined mine!

29:12.085 --> 29:13.670
Dude, I don't even know you!

29:37.110 --> 29:38.362
My heart.

29:46.578 --> 29:47.578
What the...?

29:48.163 --> 29:50.207
Wow. Really?

29:53.836 --> 29:56.588
Let this be a lesson
in the toxicity of anger.

29:59.174 --> 30:03.011
Venezuela, Uruguay, Barcelona.

30:08.183 --> 30:09.434
Who are you?

30:35.127 --> 30:39.006
All passengers:
We'll make a brief stop

30:39.089 --> 30:41.216
- at shin Yokohama.
- All right, mate, try these.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.677
- They're them momonga glasses.
- The fuck is a momonga?

30:48.265 --> 30:50.058
Comes on after Thomas every Thursday.

30:52.853 --> 30:53.854
- Okay.
- It's good.

30:53.937 --> 30:56.857
- Just like that.
- He should look asleep. There, like that.

31:05.365 --> 31:06.742
Wasabi.

31:08.118 --> 31:10.263
We gotta make sure
he doesn't step a foot off this train.

31:10.287 --> 31:12.706
You see the case,
deal with whoever has it.

31:12.789 --> 31:16.126
All right, how do I do that?
Talk to him, or, like, talk to him?

31:16.960 --> 31:19.588
Why don't you tell him about the
story about how Gordon met Percy

31:19.671 --> 31:22.299
and how Percy's now bleeding
from his fucking eye sockets!

31:25.302 --> 31:26.178
He means kill him.

31:26.261 --> 31:27.596
All passengers:

31:28.138 --> 31:31.475
- We'll make a brief stop at shin Yokohama.
- Goddamn it.

31:41.109 --> 31:42.819
Excuse me.

31:42.903 --> 31:45.364
You are fuckin' excused.

32:07.553 --> 32:08.553
Joburg.

32:19.439 --> 32:20.524
I'm sorry, buddy.

32:22.025 --> 32:23.025
Give it!

32:29.032 --> 32:30.576
Shitballs!

32:30.659 --> 32:32.244
That wasn't a minute.

32:45.799 --> 32:47.676
- I missed my stop.
- Why?

32:47.759 --> 32:50.012
- Because god hates me.
- No, she doesn't.

32:50.095 --> 32:51.948
- Do you still have the case?
- Yeah, I stashed it.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.892
- Get off at the next stop.
- It sounds so easy when you say it.

32:58.312 --> 33:00.939
Does the name El cigarillo
mean anything to you?

33:02.608 --> 33:05.569
- El saguaro? The cartel boss?
- Yeah, why does that sound so familiar?

33:05.652 --> 33:07.532
He was in the wedding
you infiltrated in Mexico.

33:08.697 --> 33:11.033
- Tequila?
- You were the cocktail server.

33:13.619 --> 33:16.538
The groom.
I knew I recognized that guy.

33:16.622 --> 33:18.749
- I'm really good with faces.
- Wait, what guy?

33:19.541 --> 33:21.210
Sorry. Be right back.

33:21.293 --> 33:23.688
The guy who stabbed me.
I spilled wine on his suit. He's dead now.

33:23.712 --> 33:26.089
- You killed the wolf?
- It was an accident.

33:26.173 --> 33:29.551
I'm really gonna have to process
my part in the incident on Monday.

33:29.635 --> 33:31.720
Shit! Fuck! No.

33:31.803 --> 33:34.181
Shit. Fuck. What?

33:34.264 --> 33:36.642
Remember those two wackos
from the Bolivia job?

33:36.725 --> 33:39.269
- The twins?
- Yeah, I'm not so sure they're twins.

33:39.353 --> 33:41.146
Stop it. Everyone knows they're twins.

33:41.271 --> 33:43.273
One of them is walking
towards me right now.

33:44.191 --> 33:45.752
I think I saw the other
one on the platform.

33:45.776 --> 33:46.610
Occupied.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.373
Now we know
who the owners of the case are.

33:48.445 --> 33:49.923
This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.

33:49.947 --> 33:51.883
We have to have a hard discussion
about the caliber of people

33:51.907 --> 33:54.307
- we are surrounding ourselves with.
- Why are we whispering?

34:00.123 --> 34:01.810
- Hello.
- The white death would like to know

34:01.834 --> 34:03.961
- why you stepped off train.
- Wanted some fresh air.

34:04.503 --> 34:06.755
Your orders were to stay on the train.

34:06.839 --> 34:09.925
I didn't realize I was gettin'
a babysitter to come cut my bollocks.

34:10.007 --> 34:13.679
I'm a professional. We're making sure
the case and his son are perfectly safe.

34:14.513 --> 34:16.306
Can I please go do my job now?

34:16.389 --> 34:18.600
Oh, very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.984
Fuck me! Jesus Christ.

34:27.067 --> 34:30.027
It's very rude, talking on the phone,
on the train in Japan.

34:30.112 --> 34:32.197
This rude enough for ya,
ya fucking prick?

34:32.281 --> 34:35.242
Shove that fuckin' hat
up your fuckin' asshole, you hear me?

34:38.954 --> 34:39.955
Fuck this job.

34:40.038 --> 34:42.123
I knew we should have got an upgrade,
fuck all.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.708
I beg your pardon, sorry.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.741
I wasn't aware
there was a young lady present. Apologize.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.760
You didn't happen to see someone come by
with a silver briefcase, did ya?

34:50.841 --> 34:52.634
There's a little train sticker
by the handle.

34:54.553 --> 34:55.596
Actually, yeah.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.932
A man with black framed glasses had it.
He went that way.

35:02.978 --> 35:03.978
Thank you, love.

35:05.856 --> 35:07.566
That fucking bastard.

35:10.611 --> 35:11.653
Come on.

35:16.366 --> 35:18.535
"Guy in black glasses. Stop him."

35:19.828 --> 35:22.706
Hi. There's a gun under this table...

35:23.248 --> 35:27.461
This is the quiet car. Gotta use
your small inside voice in here, son.

35:30.214 --> 35:33.550
There's a gun underneath this table
pointed right at you, so I would...

35:33.634 --> 35:35.994
- I can't really hear what you're saying.
- There's a gun...

35:37.888 --> 35:39.806
I'm just fuckin' with you, mate.

35:41.517 --> 35:43.185
It's been a long time
since Johannesburg.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.480
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

35:47.022 --> 35:49.149
Really. You don't remember me?

35:51.443 --> 35:53.563
You look like every white homeless man
I've ever seen.

35:54.238 --> 35:55.238
Okay.

35:56.406 --> 35:58.659
Well, I have something
I believe you're looking f...

35:58.742 --> 36:01.328
- Really? You don't remember me?
- I remember Johannesburg,

36:01.411 --> 36:03.163
- but I don't remember you.
- You shot me.

36:05.332 --> 36:06.684
- I shoot a lot of people.
- You shot me twice.

36:06.708 --> 36:08.544
Ow!

36:09.670 --> 36:11.505
Well, you also have a shootable face.

36:12.297 --> 36:13.691
I know you're black framed glasses.

36:13.715 --> 36:16.176
The cheeky fucker
who took our briefcase.

36:17.886 --> 36:19.429
Yes. Yes, I am.

36:21.056 --> 36:23.934
You know, I've done a lot
of personal work since joburg.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.811
I've forgiven, I've moved on.

36:25.894 --> 36:28.730
I've learned that
with any potential conflict

36:28.814 --> 36:31.984
there's an opportunity for growth,
a path to a peaceful outcome.

36:34.069 --> 36:35.153
Interesting.

36:35.237 --> 36:36.237
Who is that?

36:37.030 --> 36:38.198
I have no idea.

36:47.708 --> 36:49.543
How did you know that was there?

36:51.670 --> 36:52.671
Didn't I mention?

36:53.380 --> 36:54.673
I've always been lucky.

36:57.885 --> 37:01.597
It was then that I took
a long, hard look into the mirror.

37:02.139 --> 37:03.139
And you know what?

37:03.599 --> 37:05.184
Buddy, I didn't like what I saw.

37:05.893 --> 37:07.436
Nope. Nada.

37:09.479 --> 37:11.815
Until I did. You know?

37:16.278 --> 37:18.071
Between us now sits a wall.

37:19.865 --> 37:21.116
But it's an illusion.

37:22.784 --> 37:25.746
For within every wall, awaits a window...

37:26.330 --> 37:28.040
Oh, wait, it's a door.

37:28.123 --> 37:31.168
Real quick, every day
is a fucking headache with you, innit?

37:32.211 --> 37:35.088
Right. You and your partner...

37:35.172 --> 37:36.465
I'm lemon, he's tangerine.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.425
Okay, lemon... like the fruit?

37:39.009 --> 37:40.093
Blessings.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.430
- What's your plan here?
- Here's the plan.

37:43.514 --> 37:45.849
I give you back your case,
you don't kill me.

37:45.933 --> 37:48.685
You give your case to your employer,
he doesn't kill you.

37:49.186 --> 37:51.813
You're alive, I'm alive,
everyone's happy.

37:51.897 --> 37:52.981
Win-win, don't you think?

37:53.065 --> 37:56.735
How do you know whoever hired you
won't kill you for failing your job?

37:56.818 --> 37:58.487
Lose-lose. No happy.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.048
Man, I just wanna get off this train,

38:00.072 --> 38:02.574
go see a zen garden
and some shit, you know?

38:04.910 --> 38:06.703
- I'd like to accept your offer.
- Great.

38:06.787 --> 38:09.039
But then you went and killed someone.
Didn't you?

38:16.338 --> 38:18.382
- How did you know...?
- Wasn't exactly subtle.

38:18.465 --> 38:20.759
It was an accident. Tragic.

38:20.843 --> 38:21.885
Bizarre, even.

38:21.969 --> 38:23.846
Cool story, bro,

38:23.929 --> 38:26.407
but I think you had your own plans
of getting out of here with that case.

38:26.431 --> 38:28.475
- No, no.
- Pinning a body on us.

38:28.559 --> 38:29.476
Hoping the white death

38:29.560 --> 38:31.996
is so busy cuttin' off our arms
instead of cuttin' off our fingers.

38:32.020 --> 38:35.440
It's like Thomas the tank engine
always says: "Simple is better."

38:35.524 --> 38:37.364
- The kids' show?
- Yes, the fucking ki... man.

38:38.068 --> 38:39.671
I learned everything
about people from Thomas.

38:39.695 --> 38:40.904
- Everything.
- Really?

38:40.988 --> 38:43.031
It's how I can read people like you
so well.

38:43.115 --> 38:45.617
- And you are a diesel.
- I am not a diesel.

38:45.742 --> 38:47.911
- You're the diesel-est diesel...
- Not even close.

38:47.995 --> 38:49.705
I've ever seen in my life, man.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.874
'Cause diesels bluff. They go too far.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.977
I'm trying to get diesels
out of my life, you know?

38:54.001 --> 38:57.921
If there was a gun under this table, yeah,
I'd be as dead as that kid over there.

39:25.449 --> 39:26.449
Nope.

39:31.413 --> 39:33.165
You mother...

39:37.794 --> 39:39.963
Have the courage to listen.

39:57.189 --> 39:58.315
Come on, joburg.

39:58.941 --> 39:59.941
No.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.777
Shot number three.

40:14.790 --> 40:18.293
No, no, no. I ain't got the time
or the Patience, let alone the interest.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.128
Fucking hell.

40:21.213 --> 40:23.257
Are you following me? Stop!

40:23.340 --> 40:24.340
And $♪% ♪

40:25.092 --> 40:26.426
Asshole!

40:51.243 --> 40:52.411
I'll call the conductor!

40:52.494 --> 40:54.413
Eat a bag of dicks, lady!

40:54.496 --> 40:56.707
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm working on it.

41:26.111 --> 41:28.113
I'm not a diesel, you're a diesel.

41:55.641 --> 41:57.935
- There's another body here.
- Of course there is.

41:58.018 --> 42:00.479
Not my fault, and I believe
it's the son of the white death.

42:00.562 --> 42:01.563
Did the twins ID you?

42:01.647 --> 42:03.690
Did you hear what I said?
White death. Death. Death.

42:05.025 --> 42:06.443
Snatch-and-grab, my ass.

42:06.527 --> 42:08.862
There's someone else
doing a job on this train.

42:08.946 --> 42:10.322
The twins. We know that.

42:10.405 --> 42:11.907
Again, not twins.

42:11.990 --> 42:13.867
Loonies, but not twins.

42:14.826 --> 42:18.622
They're here for the kid,
but somebody killed the kid.

42:22.668 --> 42:24.503
- The guy with the knife.
- The wolf.

42:26.421 --> 42:28.507
He said he came here for revenge.

42:28.590 --> 42:31.510
He just happened to run into me,
because of course he did.

42:32.803 --> 42:34.137
Now, get this.

42:34.596 --> 42:38.433
The kid was poisoned in the same way
as El sbarro was at the wedding.

42:38.517 --> 42:40.060
It's El saguaro.

42:40.143 --> 42:41.562
- The same killer?
- Yeah.

42:43.981 --> 42:45.274
I'm like MacGyver.

42:48.318 --> 42:49.318
Fuck!

42:55.492 --> 42:59.913
All of Japan is in terror
because a poisonous snake was stolen.

42:59.997 --> 43:04.376
Boomslang snakes
have a very strong poison.

43:04.459 --> 43:07.045
When they bite,
it can cause internal bleeding...

43:07.129 --> 43:09.464
And bleeding from holes in the body.

43:09.590 --> 43:10.799
Oh, shit.

43:10.883 --> 43:12.092
What are you doing?

43:13.844 --> 43:15.053
What's wrong?

43:15.137 --> 43:16.263
Fuck this, man.

43:17.222 --> 43:18.348
Fuck carver.

43:21.185 --> 43:22.352
Shit.

43:23.729 --> 43:25.731
Oh, thank god. For a minute there...

43:25.814 --> 43:27.983
Jesus Christ,
you had a bit of a bosh, pal.

43:29.484 --> 43:32.404
All right. Five stations to Kyoto.

43:32.946 --> 43:34.364
Better get tickety-boo.

43:38.202 --> 43:40.954
Would you describe me
as someone who lives in perpetual anxiety?

43:41.038 --> 43:42.080
No, no.

43:42.164 --> 43:43.165
Ah, fucknuts.

43:43.248 --> 43:44.917
And if it wasn't clear, I meant "yes."

43:45.042 --> 43:48.146
- The conductor, I don't have a ticket.
- Not sure that's your biggest concern.

43:48.170 --> 43:50.273
You don't understand,
this guy's like criss-fuckin'-angel.

43:50.297 --> 43:51.757
He pops up everywhere.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.843
He slows me down,
tangerine catches me, I am dead.

43:55.344 --> 43:57.012
Dead. Dead.

43:59.014 --> 44:00.014
Hold on.

44:04.561 --> 44:05.854
Hey, bro.

44:08.273 --> 44:09.433
Wanna make an easy 200 bucks?

44:14.071 --> 44:16.156
Is this like a... sex thing?

44:20.327 --> 44:21.327
Nope.

44:21.787 --> 44:23.372
Oh, okay. I was kidding.

44:23.455 --> 44:25.123
Yeah, what's up?
What do you need, bro?

45:06.582 --> 45:08.125
All right, game's up, big boy.

45:08.750 --> 45:10.210
Where is the case?

45:10.794 --> 45:13.213
Tell me, and I promise
I'll only shoot you enough...

45:13.297 --> 45:16.550
Whoa, whoa, is this the sex stuff?

45:20.095 --> 45:21.138
Twat!

45:21.972 --> 45:24.558
- Shit.
- I do love an accent.

45:31.648 --> 45:32.774
Come on.

45:40.115 --> 45:41.200
Oops.

45:43.660 --> 45:44.995
Picture it.

45:45.746 --> 45:46.997
Picture what?

45:47.080 --> 45:49.249
Well, the man. Watching your son.

45:50.459 --> 45:51.502
I wonder how he'll do it.

45:53.253 --> 45:56.215
Maybe a pillow to the face.

45:56.840 --> 45:58.467
Or maybe something clever.

45:59.218 --> 46:01.178
Like an air bubble in the iv.

46:04.556 --> 46:06.058
No, no. You hold onto it.

46:06.642 --> 46:08.977
The innocent young girl act
doesn't really get you very far

46:09.061 --> 46:10.646
if you're holding a loaded gun.

46:16.944 --> 46:18.153
Put it on speaker.

46:20.364 --> 46:21.740
- Father.
- Yuichi?

46:21.823 --> 46:24.993
Why did you leave the hospital?

46:26.787 --> 46:28.038
Be honest.

46:29.039 --> 46:30.666
Who's there with you?

46:32.334 --> 46:36.588
I found out who pushed wataru
off that roof.

46:37.464 --> 46:39.174
Did you go to the authorities?

46:40.509 --> 46:41.927
I wanted to handle it myself.

46:45.514 --> 46:47.015
My son.

46:47.099 --> 46:50.269
You can't control
what fate has in store for us.

46:50.894 --> 46:51.894
Father.

46:53.063 --> 46:54.064
I'm sorry.

46:57.025 --> 46:58.235
We're not finished.

46:58.318 --> 47:01.989
You're going to sit here and you're going
to go through every combination

47:02.114 --> 47:03.657
until you open up that case.

47:03.740 --> 47:06.869
- Kid, that could take f...
- No, no. It won't.

47:07.619 --> 47:09.913
I'd start with the low numbers.
Just a thought.

47:25.554 --> 47:27.181
Fuck me!

47:29.016 --> 47:30.642
- There he is.
- He got by me.

47:30.726 --> 47:32.394
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

47:34.313 --> 47:35.606
I guess our best option now

47:35.689 --> 47:38.317
is bring the white death
the man who killed his son.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.461
- But glasses didn't do it.
- I could give a rat's ass.

47:40.485 --> 47:42.422
No, I'm telling you, I read him.
He's not the type, mate.

47:42.446 --> 47:44.156
I'll tell you what, do you like your arms?

47:44.239 --> 47:45.425
- You know I like my arms.
- Well, then

47:45.449 --> 47:47.451
someone's got to take the blame,
don't they?

47:49.870 --> 47:51.205
- That's you or me?
- You or me?

47:52.664 --> 47:55.125
Shit, that asshole stole my phone.

47:55.250 --> 47:56.293
And my gun, Lucille.

47:56.376 --> 47:58.587
- Oh, come on.
- That's my favorite gun. Son of a bitch.

47:58.670 --> 47:59.671
Fuck about.

48:00.714 --> 48:03.008
- Right, what?
- Step off the train at the next stop

48:03.091 --> 48:05.528
- with the briefcase and the son.
- Hang on a minute, didn't we say Kyoto?

48:05.552 --> 48:06.970
You will still depart at Kyoto.

48:07.054 --> 48:09.741
The white death wants to make sure
you are being honest about situation.

48:09.765 --> 48:11.517
Well, this is a complete waste of our t...

48:12.476 --> 48:15.812
All right, all right. We just have
to prove we have a case we don't have

48:15.896 --> 48:18.065
and a live son instead of a dead one.

48:19.691 --> 48:20.817
What are you thinking?

48:22.611 --> 48:24.611
- The ol' punch and Judy?
- The ol' punch and Judy.

49:07.114 --> 49:09.157
You were all told to exit the train.

49:09.283 --> 49:11.994
Yeah? Well, unlike you,
I'm a professional.

49:12.077 --> 49:14.746
I wanted to make sure it weren't
some yakuza trap, but clearly not.

49:14.830 --> 49:16.707
It's some fuckin"80s dance-off, innit?

49:18.166 --> 49:20.169
Where is your twin? Tangerine?

49:20.252 --> 49:21.253
I'm tangerine.

49:21.962 --> 49:23.589
Lemon's keepin' the case safe.

49:23.672 --> 49:24.840
And the white death's son?

49:25.632 --> 49:27.301
Yeah, he's there.

49:29.636 --> 49:31.680
Wave to your fuckin' fans, Princess.

49:33.098 --> 49:35.434
He's a fuckin' happy chappy, isn't he?

49:35.517 --> 49:38.937
But I've gotta pop on the train,
you know, ten seconds left, so ta-ra.

49:39.688 --> 49:42.566
We'll stick to the plan,
depart in Kyoto.

49:42.691 --> 49:46.111
Do us a favor:
Get the fuck off my back, will ya?

49:55.495 --> 49:56.495
Okay.

49:58.457 --> 49:59.374
Okay.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.626
Whoa!

50:03.962 --> 50:04.963
Okay.

50:06.965 --> 50:07.965
Okay.

50:09.885 --> 50:12.554
- That couldn't have gone better.
- Yeah, let's hope they buy it.

50:12.638 --> 50:15.724
We need to find that glasses twat,
like, right to the fuck now.

50:17.893 --> 50:20.312
I'm gonna go up, you go down,
double back when you're done.

50:20.395 --> 50:22.147
If you see him,
fucking deal with him, yeah?

50:22.272 --> 50:23.524
Yeah.

50:26.443 --> 50:28.070
- Up is...?
- That way. Towards Tokyo.

50:28.153 --> 50:29.947
Departing trains
are always moving down.

50:30.030 --> 50:31.198
And, look, be careful.

50:31.949 --> 50:33.909
- Something else is going on here.
- Yeah.

50:33.992 --> 50:36.328
Yeah, I still feel like
there's a diesel lurking about.

50:36.954 --> 50:40.207
I swear to god, what did I say?
What did I say?

50:40.290 --> 50:42.793
- I said I'll fucking...
- Shoot me in the face. Yeah.

50:42.876 --> 50:45.462
Thomas still taught me how
to see people, read them for real.

50:45.546 --> 50:46.755
Yeah.

50:46.839 --> 50:48.757
- And I'm never wrong, am I?
- No.

50:48.841 --> 50:50.884
Glasses, he is not our guy.

50:52.177 --> 50:53.220
Okay.

50:56.890 --> 50:59.685
You shoot first
and come up with the answers later.

51:04.231 --> 51:05.231
I always do.

51:08.151 --> 51:09.236
And, lemon?

51:09.820 --> 51:10.904
Yeah, man?

51:12.406 --> 51:13.657
You be careful, too.

51:17.619 --> 51:20.497
I mean, when this train's a-rockin'
don't come a-knockin', right?

52:08.295 --> 52:11.173
Seven more minutes
and I am off this train.

52:11.256 --> 52:12.508
Are you hiding in the bathroom?

52:12.591 --> 52:15.511
Yeah. Have you tried
these smart toilets?

52:15.594 --> 52:18.096
They're a pleasure to the senses.

52:18.597 --> 52:21.892
If I had one in the chamber
I would rock this bad boy right now.

52:21.975 --> 52:24.019
Boundaries. We need boundaries.

52:31.443 --> 52:32.694
Holy shit.

52:36.657 --> 52:38.242
Holy shit.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.209
Whoa there.

52:48.627 --> 52:50.420
Oh, look at that.

52:50.504 --> 52:52.840
I knew my luck would rub off on you.

52:54.842 --> 52:55.884
Fuck.

53:06.895 --> 53:08.397
What the fuck are you doing?

53:08.480 --> 53:12.234
I am doing the same thing
that I did to the gun in your hand.

53:16.864 --> 53:18.866
I'm just making things interesting.

53:18.949 --> 53:20.701
I'm hedging my bets, you could say.

53:20.784 --> 53:21.952
Fuck.

53:22.035 --> 53:24.621
If the gun doesn't kill him,
the case will.

53:24.746 --> 53:27.165
This thing could have
blown up in my hand at any point.

53:27.958 --> 53:31.044
No, no. It's inert unless you fire it.

53:31.628 --> 53:33.630
But don't fire it,
you know what I mean?

53:34.381 --> 53:38.343
Unlike what I put in this briefcase here.
This is very...

53:40.137 --> 53:42.764
Well, this is not inert at all.
This is...

53:45.976 --> 53:50.230
Did you know that there have been
31 attempts on the white death's life

53:50.314 --> 53:52.232
from within his own organization?

53:52.900 --> 53:56.278
Each one,
he executed with their own weapon.

53:57.738 --> 53:59.239
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

54:00.949 --> 54:02.868
Kimura, I brought you here to fail.

54:03.952 --> 54:05.954
You push my son off a roof...

54:06.038 --> 54:08.081
- Right.
- Bring me to this train...

54:08.999 --> 54:10.709
Frame me as an assassin

54:11.335 --> 54:14.338
here to kill the white death,
and use my gun...

54:15.339 --> 54:17.508
That will blow up in his face?

54:17.591 --> 54:19.051
Very good.

54:19.635 --> 54:21.512
Very, very good.

54:21.595 --> 54:23.430
It's a stupid plan.

54:24.264 --> 54:25.432
It is...

54:26.767 --> 54:28.227
A brilliant plan.

54:35.692 --> 54:37.069
Occupied.

54:38.445 --> 54:41.281
You remember that mob surgeon
that died mid-heart operation?

54:42.032 --> 54:44.910
- Yeah, he had a stroke, right?
- No, that was the official cover.

54:45.035 --> 54:47.704
He was poisoned. The assassin
goes by the name of the hornet.

54:49.122 --> 54:50.249
Oh, my god!

54:53.126 --> 54:54.795
He used boomslang snake venom.

54:54.878 --> 54:58.131
It congeals the blood,
making you bleed out of every orifice.

54:58.215 --> 55:01.260
If the antidote isn't administered
within 30 seconds, you're dead.

55:01.885 --> 55:04.721
Fun fact:
The same poison that was used on...

55:04.847 --> 55:05.847
El sagardo.

55:06.390 --> 55:08.517
It's El saguaro.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.769
What is the hornet doing on this train?

55:10.853 --> 55:14.439
Well, whatever deal was made, it wasn't
done through the normal channels.

55:14.523 --> 55:16.024
There's something else going on here.

55:16.567 --> 55:18.944
- How long are you going to be?
- It's still occupied, lady.

55:21.196 --> 55:22.406
And $♪% ♪

55:22.489 --> 55:24.449
The wolf must have
figured out who the hornet is,

55:24.533 --> 55:28.161
came here for revenge for his wife,
his boss, came here to whack the hornet.

55:28.245 --> 55:29.872
Oh, my god, did you just say "whack"?

55:29.955 --> 55:32.559
- I did, I'm bringing it back.
- No, it needs to stay where it was.

55:32.583 --> 55:34.102
If I can figure out who the hornet is,

55:34.126 --> 55:36.920
I can give him to lemon and tangerine
so they don't whack me.

55:37.004 --> 55:39.131
- Really?
- You see what I did there?

55:39.256 --> 55:40.976
You're really proud of yourself,
aren't you?

55:41.633 --> 55:44.303
Jeez, they're usually so polite here.

55:44.386 --> 55:46.346
Lady, I'm so...

55:48.265 --> 55:50.350
Oh. That's cool.

55:53.312 --> 55:54.313
Bastard!

55:57.107 --> 56:00.235
Come here, you dirty fucking scum!

56:24.426 --> 56:26.720
Wait, wait, wait.
I know who killed the kid.

56:26.803 --> 56:29.515
I couldn't give a rat's ass.
Where's my fucking case?

56:42.528 --> 56:43.528
Yeah.

56:53.664 --> 56:55.582
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

57:04.216 --> 57:06.134
Oh, no, thank you. We're okay.

57:06.218 --> 57:09.054
Oh, I would love a bottle of water.

57:11.974 --> 57:15.936
You know what? Do you have
anything sparkling? With bubbles?

57:20.524 --> 57:21.817
That's the one. Thank...

57:23.360 --> 57:24.570
Yeah.

57:24.653 --> 57:25.653
Oh, yeah.

57:27.072 --> 57:31.243
Bro, I just remembered I gave all my money
to that guy to wear my hat and glasses.

57:31.326 --> 57:32.619
Could you?

57:39.668 --> 57:41.336
How much for the bottle of water, love?

57:45.215 --> 57:47.718
Oh, there. No, you're welcome. Yeah.

57:48.427 --> 57:51.138
A thousand yen. That's ten quid
for that bottle of water, mate.

57:54.224 --> 57:55.224
Ta-ra.

58:03.317 --> 58:06.111
- You sure you don't wanna talk this out?
- Not particularly, no.

58:06.195 --> 58:07.321
Okay.

58:10.991 --> 58:14.119
You fucking bastard!
Fucker! Come here, you little fuck!

58:25.547 --> 58:28.050
I know who killed the kid.

58:28.175 --> 58:30.010
Yeah? Where the fuck is he, then?

58:31.345 --> 58:32.596
He's on this train.

58:32.679 --> 58:34.640
Well, that narrows it down, then,
don't it?

58:40.020 --> 58:41.396
Let go! Get off!

59:09.925 --> 59:10.925
You gonna get that?

59:11.885 --> 59:12.886
No.

59:13.470 --> 59:15.597
You probably oughta get that.

59:20.310 --> 59:21.562
It could be important.

59:24.189 --> 59:26.149
Okay, maybe it's important.

59:26.233 --> 59:28.151
Fucking hell. Come here.

59:29.695 --> 59:30.529
Yeah, what do you want?

59:30.612 --> 59:33.212
The white death says to get off
at next stop holding the briefcase

59:33.240 --> 59:35.033
or he will kill everyone on that train.

59:35.117 --> 59:38.871
Okay, yeah, I can make it, but lemon,
he's a little tied up right now.

59:39.413 --> 59:43.083
Both of you this time. With the case.
Or everyone dies.

59:45.502 --> 59:47.337
Fuckin' paranoid, this lot.

59:47.462 --> 59:48.982
You don't happen to have the case
on you, do ya?

59:49.006 --> 59:50.090
No.

59:52.467 --> 59:54.845
Yeah, I don't think
I'd reach lemon in time anyway.

59:55.470 --> 59:56.597
You still got his phone.

59:57.181 --> 59:58.348
Do you have a gun on ya?

01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:03.228
- Don't like 'em.
- Well...

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:06.190
Game's up, mate.

01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.609
For what it's worth,
you seem like a right fucking asshole

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.777
and I'm glad
you're gonna fucking die with me.

01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:11.904
That's nice.

01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:16.450
- Just curious.
- Yeah?

01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:19.036
Do they even know
what lemon looks like?

01:00:19.745 --> 01:00:20.871
Wow.

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:24.291
You two do look like twins, huh?

01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:28.545
Yeah, okay. We got the case, now what?

01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:31.089
You still take the train to Kyoto station.

01:00:32.674 --> 01:00:34.885
Yeah. Okay. We can do that. Wonderful.

01:00:34.968 --> 01:00:35.968
Hey.

01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:39.264
- Have you opened the case?
- No, of course not.

01:00:39.348 --> 01:00:41.534
I never asked for the combination,
you know what I mean?

01:00:41.558 --> 01:00:42.726
Keep it safe that way.

01:00:44.186 --> 01:00:45.812
So no one gets greedy.

01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:06.834
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.461
- I have this bad luck thing.
- Is that what you call it?

01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:10.963
I hit the thing and it went:

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:14.424
- Why did you even bother trying?
- I was trying to sell it.

01:01:14.508 --> 01:01:16.027
Well, I don't think
they were in the market

01:01:16.051 --> 01:01:18.345
for fucking dildos and pantyhose,
were they?

01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:19.972
But they were buying it.

01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:21.973
I had 'em.

01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:27.813
You proved you're smarter
than everyone. You've won, kid.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:29.731
Please.

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:32.651
Please, kid.

01:01:34.152 --> 01:01:35.153
Call your man.

01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:38.240
I'll do what you want.

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:41.493
Just leave my son alone.

01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.036
Your son.

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:48.959
Do you know how easy it was
to get him to follow me up onto that roof?

01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:53.172
Didn't think
it would take you three hours

01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:56.925
to even realize your son was missing.

01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:59.178
You're a terrible father,

01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:01.722
and your son is going to pay

01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:03.765
for all the mistakes that you've made.

01:02:04.474 --> 01:02:08.061
You don't know anything about life.

01:02:09.688 --> 01:02:11.148
How hard it is.

01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:13.817
You're just...

01:02:14.568 --> 01:02:15.986
Some spoiled girl

01:02:16.778 --> 01:02:18.197
who breaks their toys

01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:21.116
when mommy says she has to pick up.

01:02:21.867 --> 01:02:26.371
Sorry. Pardon me, I don't mean
to interrupt what's going on here.

01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:28.165
But you wouldn't happen to have seen

01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:31.251
a tiny white prick with a pair of glasses
come through here, have you?

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:35.464
No.

01:02:35.547 --> 01:02:38.509
What about a silver case with a train
sticker by the handle? You seen that?

01:02:38.592 --> 01:02:40.260
It's not ringing any...

01:02:40.344 --> 01:02:43.931
Uncle kimura, have you seen
a silver briefcase with the train...

01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:46.266
Did you say
"train sticker by the handle"?

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.286
- The handle had a train sticker.
- That's unique.

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.063
No, I haven't seen anything like that.
I think I'd remember.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:54.149
"Uncle kimura"?

01:02:54.816 --> 01:02:57.611
- Yeah.
- Right. Are you okay? That's...

01:02:57.694 --> 01:03:00.656
Oh, yeah. Never shave on a bullet train,
you know what they say.

01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:04.409
Well, couldn't hurt to ask, you know?
I'm just gonna keep following him.

01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:06.119
Pardon me, "uncle kimura."

01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:07.371
You guys take care.

01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:09.289
Just one thing, though.

01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:14.336
Most people assume "suitcase,"
you know, 'cause it's a train,

01:03:14.419 --> 01:03:15.629
overnight and all.

01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:17.463
But you...

01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:19.341
You said "briefcase."

01:03:20.259 --> 01:03:21.718
I never said "briefcase."

01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:23.720
I think...

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:26.640
I found my diesel.

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:33.897
You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto.

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:38.068
We should just get off this train. Now.

01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:41.334
If you think I'm stepping off this train
without lemon or the case,

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:42.363
you must be mistaken.

01:03:42.406 --> 01:03:44.783
Okay. Well, the case is
in the first-class lounge.

01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:48.161
It's behind the bar.
It's in a trash can. It's yours.

01:03:48.287 --> 01:03:50.038
Me, I'm getting off.

01:03:50.122 --> 01:03:52.475
I'm gonna go find a temple
and reevaluate my choices or something.

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:54.835
Ooh, that sounds very lovely,
but here's the deal.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.628
I still need a fall guy.

01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:58.547
Shit.

01:03:59.965 --> 01:04:01.216
- You need a fall guy.
- Yeah.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.343
No, I understand. I get it.

01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:07.639
It's a bit of a conundrum,
'cause I'm thinking,

01:04:07.723 --> 01:04:09.308
"do I hand him back in one piece"

01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:12.686
or do I chop you up into little pieces
and stuff you inside a fucking momomon.

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:14.813
That's what's
going through my head right now.

01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:17.691
Or...

01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:19.443
Or what? You got a better idea, do ya?

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:22.446
You know, before us now is just a wall,

01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:24.781
but it's an illusion, man,
it's a construct.

01:04:24.865 --> 01:04:27.492
You know,
'cause within that wall sits a window.

01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:29.161
A window of opportunity.

01:04:29.786 --> 01:04:30.829
Damn it. It's a door.

01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:34.416
Within that wall is a door.

01:04:34.499 --> 01:04:36.793
I'm finding it very hard
to follow this story.

01:04:36.877 --> 01:04:38.795
My point is, that door is closing.

01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:54.061
Now the only question is:

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:56.188
Which one is the diesel,
which one is the duck?

01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:57.356
"The duck"?

01:04:57.439 --> 01:05:00.025
It's a kid's show.
Thomas the train engine.

01:05:00.108 --> 01:05:02.736
Close. Thomas the tank engine.

01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:03.987
Please, mister.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.657
This man, he kidnapped me,

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.826
and he said that he's going
to hold me for ransom.

01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:14.831
I'm sorry.
I get captivated by white-girl tears.

01:05:14.915 --> 01:05:15.707
Bravo.

01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:19.253
Common sense tells me that this old,
shaky geezer here is the one in charge,

01:05:19.336 --> 01:05:20.879
but I'm really good at reading people

01:05:20.963 --> 01:05:23.549
and something tells me
that you are just not fucking right.

01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:30.931
So... let's see here.
I mean, I can't shoot you both.

01:05:32.599 --> 01:05:33.934
Then I get no answers.

01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:38.146
How about this? I'm sure you'll love this.
We're gonna play a little game.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.524
If you wanna play a game,
put both your hands up.

01:05:40.607 --> 01:05:42.234
Perfect. I knew you would like this.

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:45.237
You're gonna close your eyes,
and I'm gonna count to three.

01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:47.499
Whichever one is in charge,
raise your hand.

01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:49.491
Whichever one isn't,
you point at the one who is.

01:05:49.575 --> 01:05:52.053
Now if you both raise your hands
or you both point at each other,

01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:53.972
I know you're both liars,
and the truth ain't in ya.

01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:55.914
And then I'll fucking shoot you both.
Ready?

01:05:55.998 --> 01:05:59.042
You said you couldn't kill us both.
You'd get no answers.

01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:01.295
- I did say that. Didn't I?
- Yes.

01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:05.424
Sometimes you gotta shoot first
and come up with answers later.

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.217
One.

01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:09.821
Or if I don't answer
this phone when you call...

01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:12.514
Two. Three.
Kill wataru.

01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.252
Am I dreaming?

01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:14.034
Sorry, mate. Not your lucky day.

01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:22.334
I have a wire in my bag,

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:26.421
and I think that we could use it
to lock the door from the outside.

01:07:28.006 --> 01:07:29.383
It was so scary.

01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:33.846
He said that if I didn't do what he said,
or if I yelled or anything,

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:35.973
that he would do
awful, awful things to me.

01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:37.766
Then why didn't you use this, then?

01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:45.566
Yeah, he kidnapped ya
and gave you his gun to hold, right?

01:07:45.649 --> 01:07:46.817
- No, no, no.
- Easy.

01:07:47.568 --> 01:07:50.863
Please. I don't know how to use a gun.
I don't know. Please.

01:07:50.946 --> 01:07:52.573
Fuck me. You are fucking...

01:07:52.656 --> 01:07:55.033
You are really good.
You sure you didn't study?

01:07:55.117 --> 01:07:57.119
You're not even afraid
and your lip's quivering.

01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.830
That's a tear.
That is really authentic, mate.

01:07:59.913 --> 01:08:00.913
You're the diesel.

01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:03.041
- I gotta kill ya.
- Please.

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.334
I'm just a kid. Please.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:07.296
How do you do that?!
It's really unbelievable!

01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:08.463
Please. Please.

01:08:17.221 --> 01:08:18.221
I got...

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.560
It's fucking... you stay right there.

01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:24.354
Did you...? What the fuck is happening?

01:08:26.273 --> 01:08:27.566
Everyone loves lemons.

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:38.785
Fucking die!

01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:53.300
I'm glad you enjoyed the performance.

01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:56.178
How did you do that?

01:08:57.386 --> 01:08:58.805
I'm not sure.

01:08:58.889 --> 01:09:00.599
Just lucky, I guess.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.687
Tell tangerine... tell tangerine...

01:09:07.606 --> 01:09:08.689
Tangerine...

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:10.649
He's Gordon.

01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:13.237
Tangerine is Gordon.

01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:24.081
Getting off this train.
I'm getting that case, and that's it.

01:09:32.214 --> 01:09:33.214
Hello?

01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:34.756
Yuichi.

01:09:37.511 --> 01:09:40.346
It looks like yuichi lost his phone
on the bullet train.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.182
You can pick it up
at Kyoto station, though.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.100
- Kyoto?
- There's this find my phone app.

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.187
Surprisingly accurate.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.313
Bye.

01:10:07.249 --> 01:10:09.168
God, he's got a great walk.

01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:18.385
Mr. Wolf.

01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:21.138
So you came to kill the hornet.

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:30.772
What happened?

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:35.736
Are you okay?

01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:40.741
Fuck, that thing is hot.

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:50.834
Momomomo. Momomon. Momon. Momomon.

01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:06.767
The pastry chef.

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:20.405
You stole my snake, bitch.

01:11:22.324 --> 01:11:25.369
That was your...? We should really
call the authorities 'cause someone...

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.544
Take that, punk!

01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:39.383
Hey, bitch. One little prick from this,
you know what happens?

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:42.386
- Yes.
- Your blood congeals, clogging your veins.

01:11:42.469 --> 01:11:45.264
- You bleed out of your fucking eye socket.
- I said yes!

01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:48.475
Weak-ass bitch.

01:11:50.352 --> 01:11:51.937
- Stop!
- I'm taking that case.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.146
Give it!

01:11:53.939 --> 01:11:55.399
I was promised my money.

01:11:56.024 --> 01:11:58.569
- By who?
- Don't know. It was all online.

01:11:58.652 --> 01:12:00.571
They said my money was in the case.

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:04.491
What? Someone paid you to have
the kid killed with his own ransom?

01:12:04.616 --> 01:12:06.076
Wow. That's dark.

01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:08.078
That is dark as... stop!

01:12:12.332 --> 01:12:13.917
The hornet stings, bitch!

01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:16.461
Lady, you can have the case.

01:12:16.545 --> 01:12:18.881
Oh, but you've seen my face, bitch.

01:12:30.434 --> 01:12:32.811
Thirty seconds
before the venom does its thing.

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:52.706
You bitch.

01:12:52.789 --> 01:12:55.959
Oh, shit, man. Do you have a backup?

01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:58.170
What do you think, bitch?

01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:02.049
Oh, shit, man.

01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:05.427
You don't have another one?

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:07.346
You gotta be better prepared.

01:13:07.429 --> 01:13:10.224
I'm mansplaining,
I'm mansplaining again. I'm sorry.

01:13:12.142 --> 01:13:14.102
Can I get you something?

01:13:20.192 --> 01:13:22.402
You don't seem like a religious person.

01:13:24.488 --> 01:13:26.823
Water? Would you like some water?

01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:29.117
No?

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:31.495
You want a blanket?

01:13:31.578 --> 01:13:33.497
You want me to hold your hand?

01:13:44.091 --> 01:13:45.759
Karma is a bitch.

01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:02.728
Talk to me.

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.607
It's my bad luck.
It's bad luck on acid.

01:16:05.691 --> 01:16:07.651
I gotta get off this train.

01:16:07.734 --> 01:16:09.069
Do you have the case?

01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:11.237
Yes.

01:16:11.864 --> 01:16:13.991
Are you lying on the ground
in the fetal position?

01:16:16.034 --> 01:16:17.411
I'm not on the ground.

01:16:17.494 --> 01:16:18.745
You need to get up.

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:21.790
- How do you always know what I'm doing?
- Because I know you.

01:16:21.874 --> 01:16:23.500
I could journal. I should journal.

01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:27.212
Ladybug. Ladybug. Breathe. Deep breaths.

01:16:27.296 --> 01:16:30.007
We're almost there.
You just need to get up.

01:16:30.883 --> 01:16:31.883
Right.

01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:54.489
You have been lying to me, my friend.

01:16:56.158 --> 01:16:58.452
Well, cat's out of the bag now, innit?

01:16:58.535 --> 01:17:01.788
You were responsible
for keeping my son safe,

01:17:01.872 --> 01:17:03.290
for keeping my money safe.

01:17:03.373 --> 01:17:05.667
I don't know a thing or two
about being a parent.

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.085
But you know what I would do,

01:17:07.586 --> 01:17:10.297
being that it's your son
and your money?

01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:15.010
I'd stop crying about your dead wife,
get off your fucking lazy ass,

01:17:15.093 --> 01:17:16.887
come here and finish the job yourself.

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.056
But as we're having
a bit of a heart-to-heart,

01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:20.599
got a couple things to tell ya.

01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:21.826
Your son's a complete bellend

01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:24.311
and fuckin' deserves
to be bleeding out of his eye sockets.

01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:26.939
And as for your case,
I haven't seen it since Tokyo.

01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:28.542
And I hope someone's fuckin' found it,

01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:31.401
put it all on red
and having a fuckin' wonderful time.

01:17:31.485 --> 01:17:33.529
I will meet you at Kyoto station.

01:17:33.612 --> 01:17:35.948
Oh, how wonderful. I can't fucking wait.

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:40.369
I want to look into your eyes
when I kill you and your brother.

01:17:47.084 --> 01:17:48.084
My brother.

01:17:51.839 --> 01:17:54.216
I'm forever blowing bubbles

01:17:54.299 --> 01:17:57.469
pretty bubbles in the air

01:17:57.553 --> 01:17:59.137
west ham have taken it!

01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:01.890
West ham 1, Chelsea nil.

01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:09.439
Morning rush hour's rolling in
quite nicely.

01:18:09.982 --> 01:18:10.816
What's your plan, mate?

01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:13.068
You gonna fuckin' waltz up here
and blow my brains out

01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:15.362
in front of the whole
fuckin' carriage of witnesses?

01:18:15.445 --> 01:18:18.156
There is no one left on that train.

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.740
I know.

01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:24.329
I bought every ticket
until the end of the line.

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:28.958
Oi.

01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:30.459
You.

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:31.920
I know you.

01:18:32.713 --> 01:18:34.423
You're that girl, aren't ya?

01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:35.883
Oh, my god.

01:18:35.966 --> 01:18:37.801
Yeah, I never forget a face, me.

01:18:37.885 --> 01:18:40.053
I'm so happy to see you.
Please help me.

01:18:41.346 --> 01:18:43.765
There's this man,
and he was holding me hostage.

01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:47.978
He was wearing glasses,
and he killed my uncle.

01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:50.147
And he also killed
this other man who, I don't know,

01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:54.985
he just kept talking about
Thomas the trains and...

01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:56.236
Tank engine.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.362
Yeah, right. Exactly.

01:18:57.446 --> 01:18:58.780
But he killed both of them,

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:02.618
and then he said he was going to get away
with some sort of money. I don't know.

01:19:03.243 --> 01:19:06.914
I'm sorry, darling. I beg your pardon.
I don't know who the fuck you are.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.377
I'm just a girl who was supposed
to get off at nagoya, and then this man...

01:19:12.461 --> 01:19:13.879
That was fucking ages ago.

01:19:13.962 --> 01:19:17.382
I know, but this man, he just said
that I could be a good backup plan

01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:19.843
and that a pretty girl
makes a good hostage.

01:19:19.927 --> 01:19:23.138
Well, he ain't wrong there.
But, look, keep your fucking knickers on.

01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:25.557
- Please just help me.
- All right. Calm down.

01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:28.101
Get off or do what the fuck you like.
You're free to go.

01:19:28.185 --> 01:19:29.686
- Thank you.
- It's all right. Go on.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.450
I don't know
what you're doing here anyway.

01:19:36.151 --> 01:19:37.444
Are you okay?

01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:38.903
Diesel.

01:19:39.363 --> 01:19:41.198
The absolutely fucking worst.

01:19:41.865 --> 01:19:43.200
Little shit stirrer.

01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:48.664
See, lemon...

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.835
God rest his soul,

01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:55.170
was the Don.

01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:58.006
And he could read people,

01:19:58.549 --> 01:20:00.175
see them for who they really are.

01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:02.427
He was right.

01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:04.304
There's been a diesel

01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:09.351
running up and down this train,
causing all sorts of fucking havoc.

01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:13.939
And it was you the whole fucking time,
you dirty little diesel!

01:20:17.693 --> 01:20:19.194
You made lemon bleed...

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.864
And lemon never bleeds.

01:20:22.906 --> 01:20:24.950
Oh, my god! Mister, please help me!

01:20:25.033 --> 01:20:27.494
Please! Please help me! Please!

01:20:27.578 --> 01:20:29.413
What the fuck are you doing,
you bellend!

01:20:47.264 --> 01:20:48.307
What?

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.391
Diesel!

01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:50.642
What?

01:20:50.726 --> 01:20:52.728
You fucking bellend!

01:20:57.191 --> 01:20:58.358
You're a diesel.

01:20:59.985 --> 01:21:01.737
What the fuck?

01:21:04.156 --> 01:21:05.324
What the fuck?

01:21:06.074 --> 01:21:09.494
He said that he was going to kill you
and blame everything on you.

01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:15.083
He also said that there's someone
waiting for us at Kyoto station.

01:21:15.876 --> 01:21:18.921
Someone scary, who would hurt me.

01:21:19.963 --> 01:21:21.590
No one's gonna hurt you.

01:21:22.132 --> 01:21:23.509
It's okay.

01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:25.719
We're getting off this train.

01:21:34.478 --> 01:21:36.730
We make the next stop, we'll be fine.

01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:58.042
Okay, kid, come o...

01:21:58.085 --> 01:21:59.211
Kid, come on!

01:22:00.003 --> 01:22:01.630
I can't, my backpack is stuck!

01:22:01.713 --> 01:22:02.756
What?

01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:04.800
Leave it, let's go.

01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:06.677
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- No, I can't!

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.053
Right now, young lady!

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:10.097
- No!
- It's our last chance!

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.390
Please come back!

01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:12.808
Kid, please.

01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:15.769
I'm scared,
I don't want to be alone, please!

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.484
I got it.

01:22:22.568 --> 01:22:25.112
It's not your fault, kid.

01:22:25.779 --> 01:22:27.531
It's my luck, not yours.

01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:32.327
You got your whole life ahead of you.

01:22:32.828 --> 01:22:35.122
Make sure you do something
that brings you peace.

01:22:35.956 --> 01:22:38.625
'Cause everything else
is a pain in the ass.

01:22:39.418 --> 01:22:43.046
And if you run into a guy named carver,
he's a dick.

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:44.715
You can tell him I said so.

01:22:52.306 --> 01:22:54.099
I took this. I didn't want to leave it.

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.436
The man had it,
and I thought you could probably use it

01:22:57.519 --> 01:23:00.314
to kill whoever's waiting
for us at the end of the line.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.025
You're not going to let me get hurt.

01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:04.526
Be honest.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.320
Be honest.

01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:08.822
Who's there with you?

01:23:14.828 --> 01:23:15.829
Really?

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.580
Right.

01:23:18.081 --> 01:23:20.626
Okay, fella, you're creepin' me out.

01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:24.838
So, if you don't mind,
could you just find another seat, like,

01:23:24.922 --> 01:23:28.217
way, way, way down there?

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:32.262
And that way,
I won't have to tell you twice.

01:23:33.013 --> 01:23:34.013
No.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.849
You won't.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.815
Let's just move. Let me grab your bag.

01:23:56.995 --> 01:23:58.247
Was that a snake?

01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:00.082
Would you know where my son is?

01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:22.312
Oh, fuck.

01:24:34.575 --> 01:24:35.701
After everything.

01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:43.959
You are the person

01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:48.046
who pushed my grandson
off the department store roof.

01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:49.256
Why?

01:24:49.339 --> 01:24:50.465
Your son.

01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:54.636
He was going to help me
kill the white death at Kyoto station.

01:24:55.762 --> 01:24:58.348
And that was the only way
to get him on this train.

01:25:01.518 --> 01:25:02.936
The white death.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.479
That's right.

01:25:04.605 --> 01:25:06.982
But he couldn't even do that.

01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:09.610
So he's dead.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.904
Just a few cars back.

01:25:12.613 --> 01:25:14.031
They are both dead.

01:25:21.914 --> 01:25:24.666
My grandson was pushed off a roof.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:28.795
What makes you think
I would leave him unprotected?

01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:54.780
My grandson is safe.

01:25:55.864 --> 01:25:57.950
And my son is not dead.

01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:00.661
Listen, old man...

01:26:00.744 --> 01:26:03.497
The only thing you know
about an old man, young lady,

01:26:04.248 --> 01:26:06.667
is that he has survived much more,

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:10.420
and much worse, than you.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.348
I'll fucking kill him myself.

01:26:30.816 --> 01:26:32.442
- Are you all right?
- From that?

01:26:34.111 --> 01:26:36.572
You're not gonna believe
this coincidence

01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:41.118
but I already got a dose of antivenom
in me today, so I'm good.

01:26:42.411 --> 01:26:43.704
Probably.

01:26:46.039 --> 01:26:47.039
The girl...

01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:49.793
Her intentions with you
were not honorable.

01:26:49.918 --> 01:26:51.587
Yeah.

01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:55.007
A blind man could see
you are the one in the dark.

01:26:55.132 --> 01:26:58.010
I don't know about a blind man.
She was pretty convincing.

01:26:59.011 --> 01:27:01.638
- What did you do to her?
- I did not need to do anything.

01:27:02.556 --> 01:27:05.100
Fate will do what it wills.

01:27:07.644 --> 01:27:09.855
Why do you laugh at fate?

01:27:11.148 --> 01:27:16.069
Man, fate for me is
just another word for bad luck.

01:27:17.321 --> 01:27:21.783
And that follows me around like...

01:27:24.119 --> 01:27:25.996
I don't know, something witty.

01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:31.668
My handler calls me ladybug.

01:27:32.377 --> 01:27:33.670
She's witty.

01:27:33.754 --> 01:27:35.088
Ladybug?

01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:36.006
Yeah.

01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:38.592
This is very lucky, indeed.

01:27:40.344 --> 01:27:42.471
No, she's being ironic, she...

01:27:43.347 --> 01:27:44.223
Never mind.

01:27:44.306 --> 01:27:46.350
I'm going to tell you a story now.

01:27:46.433 --> 01:27:48.060
- No, I'm good.
- It's short.

01:27:48.769 --> 01:27:49.686
Really, I'm fine.

01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:51.897
No, it's very quick.

01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.565
No, no.

01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:55.901
It's a good story for you, I think.

01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:57.361
I'm cool.

01:27:57.444 --> 01:27:58.487
Here we go.

01:28:00.489 --> 01:28:01.907
A long time ago,

01:28:02.491 --> 01:28:04.409
I made a promise to myself

01:28:06.078 --> 01:28:10.499
that I would provide for my family
no matter what it cost.

01:28:13.752 --> 01:28:19.091
I had risen to a highly coveted position
within the minegishi crime family.

01:28:19.758 --> 01:28:22.010
A man raised up to take my place.

01:28:22.094 --> 01:28:24.012
A man from the north.

01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:33.605
I asked minegishi not to trust this man.

01:28:34.565 --> 01:28:38.610
Minegishi told me I had lost my appetite.

01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:39.694
He was not wrong.

01:28:40.737 --> 01:28:42.239
But neither was I.

01:29:05.262 --> 01:29:06.305
I returned home

01:29:06.388 --> 01:29:11.018
and found nothing except ash and blood.

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:32.247
The white death
had taken everything from me.

01:29:32.331 --> 01:29:34.082
Almost.

01:29:46.011 --> 01:29:47.471
I went into hiding.

01:29:48.388 --> 01:29:51.433
I searched for a way
to strike at the white death

01:29:51.517 --> 01:29:54.144
without endangering what I had left.

01:29:54.853 --> 01:29:57.105
But he remained forever out of reach.

01:29:58.857 --> 01:30:00.234
I did not think

01:30:00.317 --> 01:30:03.987
fate would ever give me
a chance to make things right.

01:30:06.073 --> 01:30:09.034
Do you know what they call
a ladybug in Japan?

01:30:12.162 --> 01:30:13.330
Tentoumushi.

01:30:13.872 --> 01:30:18.001
As a boy, I was told
there is a spot on its back

01:30:18.085 --> 01:30:20.587
for each
of the seven sorrows of the world.

01:30:21.588 --> 01:30:24.800
You see, tentoumushi is not lucky.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:30.389
It holds all the bad luck
so that others may live in peace.

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:35.727
I don't wanna hold the seven sorrows.

01:30:35.811 --> 01:30:39.773
Everything that's ever happened to you
has led you here.

01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:42.609
Fate.

01:30:43.193 --> 01:30:45.028
Well, that's a shit deal.

01:30:46.947 --> 01:30:48.323
At Kyoto station,

01:30:49.157 --> 01:30:51.994
the white death
will arrive on this train.

01:30:53.036 --> 01:30:56.039
I will finally be allowed
to make things right.

01:30:57.708 --> 01:30:59.668
My son is a few cars up.

01:30:59.751 --> 01:31:02.462
If you could escort him off this train...

01:31:03.505 --> 01:31:07.885
Yeah, I don't see the white death
letting any of us off this train.

01:31:09.636 --> 01:31:11.847
You let me worry
about the white death.

01:31:14.516 --> 01:31:15.516
Okay.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.813
Mr. Ladybug?

01:31:22.482 --> 01:31:24.943
- Your briefcase.
- Thank you.

01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:37.915
Father.

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:40.792
I don't understand.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.754
It is fate, my son.

01:31:44.421 --> 01:31:45.589
And wataru?

01:31:45.672 --> 01:31:46.882
He is safe.

01:31:50.302 --> 01:31:51.302
Well...

01:31:51.929 --> 01:31:53.514
He seemed like a decent guy.

01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:55.933
He shot me.

01:31:56.558 --> 01:31:57.558
Me, too.

01:31:57.601 --> 01:31:58.601
Twice.

01:31:59.353 --> 01:32:00.979
Still, he had another side to him...

01:32:03.524 --> 01:32:04.608
Wow.

01:32:08.487 --> 01:32:09.613
Oh, man.

01:32:11.031 --> 01:32:12.115
Am I in hell?

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.662
Ah, fuck.

01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:22.125
Fuckin' vest, man.

01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:25.963
Oh, you drank the water.

01:32:30.259 --> 01:32:32.094
Where the fuck is my brother?

01:33:03.333 --> 01:33:04.418
Aw, man.

01:33:18.849 --> 01:33:19.849
You...

01:33:24.938 --> 01:33:26.982
You were more
like Thomas anyway, right?

01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:02.643
Fellas.

01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:05.103
We need to come up with a plan.

01:34:05.187 --> 01:34:09.149
You killed my brother.
You killed my brother, you piece of shit!

01:34:09.233 --> 01:34:11.527
Yeah, you fucking shot me!

01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:13.410
I'll shoot you in the fucking throat
next time

01:34:13.487 --> 01:34:15.364
and your fucking partner Keira knightley!

01:34:15.447 --> 01:34:17.407
- She is not my...
- Hey! Fellas!

01:34:17.491 --> 01:34:20.577
When we are so quick to anger,
we are slow to understand.

01:34:20.661 --> 01:34:22.621
I'm fast to kick your ass, though,
I swear to god.

01:34:24.206 --> 01:34:27.292
Fucking piece of shit! I shoulda
put a bullet through your fucking ass!

01:34:27.376 --> 01:34:29.711
When you point a finger
at someone in blame,

01:34:29.795 --> 01:34:31.839
there are four fingers
pointing back at you.

01:34:32.506 --> 01:34:34.758
Or three. That's weird.

01:34:34.842 --> 01:34:37.177
Fuck it! That's it!
You know what I could do!

01:34:37.261 --> 01:34:39.596
- We before me!
- You before fucking god...

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.722
Gentlemen!

01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:42.808
Get off me!

01:34:43.642 --> 01:34:48.897
A plum does not resent the hungry man,
but the farmer who planted the tree.

01:34:50.983 --> 01:34:53.068
He resents the farmer?

01:34:53.151 --> 01:34:55.988
So how do plums have fuckin' resentments?
So how can it resent?

01:34:56.071 --> 01:34:58.907
Listen. The white death is the farmer.

01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:03.453
So we're the plums. We're the plums?

01:35:03.537 --> 01:35:06.017
It don't make sense.
Why are you motherfuckers using metaphors?

01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:07.666
Look, he shot my fucking brother!

01:35:07.749 --> 01:35:09.418
You shot my son!

01:35:13.422 --> 01:35:15.048
We prepare together...

01:35:16.008 --> 01:35:17.509
Or we die alone.

01:35:19.344 --> 01:35:21.054
That's all I was trying to say.

01:35:24.808 --> 01:35:29.521
The white death waits for you
with his army of assassins.

01:35:29.605 --> 01:35:32.191
Killers from all countries.

01:35:32.774 --> 01:35:38.113
But he has no idea
my son and I are on this train.

01:35:38.697 --> 01:35:40.157
If fate wills,

01:35:41.033 --> 01:35:42.910
I will get my revenge.

01:35:44.453 --> 01:35:47.998
I'll head to the back
and stop as many as I can.

01:35:48.498 --> 01:35:52.085
I'll go to the driver car
and get us the fuck out of here.

01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:59.760
What are you gonna do, joburg?

01:36:01.887 --> 01:36:03.222
I'm gonna buy us some time.

01:37:01.405 --> 01:37:02.447
Daughter.

01:37:04.241 --> 01:37:05.409
Father.

01:37:13.584 --> 01:37:16.461
Hey, fellas, I'm looking for a Mr. Death.

01:37:16.587 --> 01:37:18.088
Got his case here.

01:37:18.839 --> 01:37:20.215
Hey, easy.

01:37:28.515 --> 01:37:30.184
Hurt people hurt people.

01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:38.567
I came to see you.

01:37:40.694 --> 01:37:43.113
And to make you finally see me.

01:37:45.073 --> 01:37:46.575
The real me.

01:37:49.411 --> 01:37:53.165
I built myself up
from the nothing you gave me.

01:37:53.248 --> 01:37:56.043
All so I could be
the one in front of you today...

01:37:57.002 --> 01:37:58.629
My finger on the trigger.

01:38:00.881 --> 01:38:02.466
I was the one...

01:38:03.592 --> 01:38:05.469
Who deserved your attention.

01:38:09.723 --> 01:38:10.891
Your love.

01:38:11.892 --> 01:38:15.479
I'm more like you
than that little fuckup ever was.

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.827
Do it.

01:38:33.247 --> 01:38:34.665
I came here to kill you.

01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:38.418
So kill me.

01:38:40.754 --> 01:38:43.549
Kill me like you did
all the others who tried the same.

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.144
Do it.

01:39:02.484 --> 01:39:03.819
Fucking do it!

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:10.701
Pow.

01:39:17.541 --> 01:39:19.126
I see you, dochka.

01:39:20.377 --> 01:39:22.296
I always have.

01:39:24.673 --> 01:39:28.468
But you have never been part of my plan.

01:39:34.558 --> 01:39:36.018
We found the American!

01:39:39.104 --> 01:39:40.522
What about the others?

01:39:40.606 --> 01:39:41.940
They're all dead.

01:39:42.566 --> 01:39:45.485
Good news is I have your case.

01:39:46.737 --> 01:39:49.114
Ay, good news, good news.

01:39:49.198 --> 01:39:50.908
Check the case.

01:39:50.991 --> 01:39:53.410
Hurry. Move. Let's go.

01:39:55.037 --> 01:39:56.288
Clear the train.

01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:01.960
All right, Thomas.
Time for you to start up...

01:40:02.044 --> 01:40:04.588
Oh, shit. Everything's in Japanese.

01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:06.590
There is no episode in Japanese.
What the f...?

01:40:11.136 --> 01:40:12.387
Get on the ground!

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.190
Man, I got a bad feeling about this.
We have no idea what's in this case.

01:40:23.273 --> 01:40:24.353
What are you talkin' about?

01:40:24.399 --> 01:40:26.818
Why is it always gotta be us
that opens this shit?

01:40:26.902 --> 01:40:28.612
Just open the goddamn case.

01:40:28.695 --> 01:40:30.405
I'd like to keep my fuckin' arms.

01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:33.534
Mr. Death, if I may?

01:40:34.785 --> 01:40:36.662
The shadow buyer

01:40:37.329 --> 01:40:40.999
who bought all our contracts,
got us all on this train.

01:40:41.083 --> 01:40:42.083
Me, the hornet,

01:40:42.125 --> 01:40:43.585
tangerine, lemon...

01:40:45.337 --> 01:40:46.797
That was you, right?

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.092
Yes, very astute.

01:40:50.175 --> 01:40:52.970
I brought you on this train
hoping you'd kill each other.

01:40:53.053 --> 01:40:54.053
Okay.

01:40:56.014 --> 01:40:58.684
If I could... why?

01:40:58.767 --> 01:41:01.103
Why you do what you do?

01:41:01.186 --> 01:41:03.897
You know, I've been
asking that very question.

01:41:03.981 --> 01:41:06.358
If it's so safe,
why didn't he just open it?

01:41:06.441 --> 01:41:08.777
What if it's a bomb
and it blows up in our faces?

01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:11.321
You think these stupid masks
are gonna protect us?

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.829
All these years later...

01:41:18.912 --> 01:41:23.292
The burden of your betrayal
still heavy upon your heads.

01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:28.046
Let me relieve you of both.

01:41:29.131 --> 01:41:30.424
My wife...

01:41:31.758 --> 01:41:33.135
Was taken from me.

01:41:36.555 --> 01:41:40.893
I heard. I'm so sorry for your loss.
It was a horrible accident.

01:41:42.978 --> 01:41:44.813
- Horrible.
- Oh, no.

01:41:44.897 --> 01:41:48.400
No. Nothing in life is an accident.

01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:51.987
It was an assassination attempt on me.

01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:53.070
But fate...

01:41:54.948 --> 01:41:58.327
Fate put two wet work operatives,

01:41:58.869 --> 01:42:02.372
twins, on a job in Bolivia,

01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:06.793
butchering my entire crew.

01:42:06.877 --> 01:42:09.630
And I had to go deal with it.

01:42:09.713 --> 01:42:12.090
And he didn't hire
two random operators, lemon.

01:42:12.174 --> 01:42:14.551
No, he asked for the two
responsible for the Bolivia job.

01:42:14.635 --> 01:42:19.765
That is why it was my wife
in the car that night,

01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:21.390
not me.

01:42:21.808 --> 01:42:24.895
Fate put my wife in the hospital.

01:42:25.687 --> 01:42:27.523
A piece of her rib

01:42:28.398 --> 01:42:30.442
piercing her heart.

01:42:32.861 --> 01:42:37.991
Only the most skilled cardiovascular
surgeon could save her life.

01:42:40.327 --> 01:42:45.332
But two nights earlier,
this surgeon was poisoned.

01:42:48.043 --> 01:42:48.877
Oh, my god!

01:42:48.961 --> 01:42:51.672
Fate. Fate again.

01:42:52.506 --> 01:42:53.966
They said my money was in the case!

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:58.428
Don't wanna sound judgmental,
but if you hired the hornet,

01:42:58.554 --> 01:43:00.722
you had your own kid killed?

01:43:00.806 --> 01:43:02.474
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

01:43:02.558 --> 01:43:04.852
Oh, yes, I did. The piece of shit.

01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:06.353
Please, please.

01:43:06.436 --> 01:43:07.436
That night...

01:43:08.146 --> 01:43:10.858
- Please pick me up.
- I told her not to leave.

01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:13.193
To wait for me.

01:43:13.819 --> 01:43:18.782
But she promised it was the last time
we would ever bail him out of trouble.

01:43:18.866 --> 01:43:21.285
I will come. I will always come for you.

01:43:21.994 --> 01:43:25.497
Well, I suppose she was right.

01:43:26.248 --> 01:43:29.751
If I had amputated that weakness

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.421
out of my life years ago,

01:43:32.504 --> 01:43:35.299
she would still be by my side!

01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:39.011
Yeah, it helps to process this.
I have a good therapist.

01:43:39.094 --> 01:43:40.971
I loved my wife very much.

01:43:42.389 --> 01:43:44.224
She taught me a valuable lesson.

01:43:44.933 --> 01:43:47.019
If you do not control your fate...

01:43:48.353 --> 01:43:49.563
It will control you.

01:43:51.273 --> 01:43:53.567
So I took control.

01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:55.444
I brought them all here to die.

01:44:00.324 --> 01:44:03.535
But now there is only one left.

01:44:05.704 --> 01:44:07.581
Mr. Carver.

01:44:09.458 --> 01:44:10.584
Excuse me?

01:44:10.667 --> 01:44:12.628
I'm filling in for carver?
Calling in sick?

01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:14.004
Fuck carver.

01:44:14.087 --> 01:44:16.507
The man who murdered my wife.

01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:23.764
Bro.

01:44:23.847 --> 01:44:26.391
- Just open it!
- Fine. Ya happy?

01:44:26.475 --> 01:44:27.475
I'm not carver!

01:44:44.368 --> 01:44:45.368
He went that way.

01:44:54.545 --> 01:44:56.129
Oh, shit. Okay.

01:44:57.172 --> 01:44:58.882
Oh, shit. Something's happening.

01:45:27.452 --> 01:45:28.829
Excuse me.

01:45:30.205 --> 01:45:31.206
Yep.

01:46:12.372 --> 01:46:13.916
Kimura.

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:15.750
Why are you here?

01:46:16.668 --> 01:46:17.878
Your daughter.

01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:19.838
It would seem she pushed...

01:46:19.922 --> 01:46:22.549
The wrong grandson off a roof.

01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:29.640
Ah, children. You do the best you can
to raise them right.

01:46:31.433 --> 01:46:33.227
Cockroach,
I do not know why you are here,

01:46:33.352 --> 01:46:36.605
but move out of my way
or you will join your wife.

01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:40.275
Our paths were destined
to return to each other.

01:46:43.403 --> 01:46:44.403
Okay.

01:46:44.863 --> 01:46:48.075
Wait. Fuckin' slow down, mate. Come on!

01:46:48.158 --> 01:46:50.869
Hey, so far so good.
You can stop the train.

01:46:50.953 --> 01:46:54.248
About that. I took the velocity
of the train and divided it by the mass,

01:46:54.331 --> 01:46:57.167
and I realized that I don't know how
to fuckin' drive a bullet train.

01:46:57.251 --> 01:46:59.002
Dude, all you do is talk about trains.

01:46:59.086 --> 01:47:01.421
Thomas is a metaphor for life,
not how to actually drive...

01:47:01.547 --> 01:47:02.881
Get down!

01:47:29.867 --> 01:47:30.909
Shit.

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.502
I got this! Stop the train!

01:47:40.586 --> 01:47:41.753
What?!

01:48:33.472 --> 01:48:34.872
English, English, English, English.

01:48:35.516 --> 01:48:37.184
English. Brakes!

01:48:37.267 --> 01:48:39.394
We're good! I got it!

01:48:40.854 --> 01:48:41.854
No!

01:48:44.775 --> 01:48:46.985
- Hold on!
- We're on the wrong track!

01:49:01.834 --> 01:49:03.335
- Oi, joburg!
- What?

01:49:06.547 --> 01:49:07.923
I'm sorry I shot you!

01:49:08.006 --> 01:49:10.092
Actually it was, like, twice!

01:49:14.179 --> 01:49:15.097
Sorry?

01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.140
You shot me twice!

01:49:28.986 --> 01:49:30.279
I'm sorry I shot you twice.

01:49:32.406 --> 01:49:33.406
Thanks, man!

01:49:34.199 --> 01:49:35.534
That shows real growth!

01:49:39.872 --> 01:49:42.332
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck.

01:49:51.717 --> 01:49:53.343
You are not ruled by strength.

01:49:53.427 --> 01:49:54.803
You are ruled by fear!

01:49:55.762 --> 01:49:58.348
Fear of the one thing
deep down you cannot control!

01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:07.608
Fear of fate!

01:50:15.949 --> 01:50:18.952
Hey, and I'm sorry about tangerine.

01:50:20.245 --> 01:50:21.288
Yeah.

01:50:22.497 --> 01:50:23.497
Yeah.

01:50:24.958 --> 01:50:26.376
But I got another brother now.

01:50:27.002 --> 01:50:28.002
Really?

01:50:30.797 --> 01:50:31.797
Fuck no!

01:50:56.031 --> 01:50:57.741
For old times' sake.

01:51:39.283 --> 01:51:40.367
Fuck it.

01:52:04.433 --> 01:52:06.059
$♪%♪

01:52:11.023 --> 01:52:12.608
B-20.

01:52:13.984 --> 01:52:14.985
Let's go.

01:52:17.446 --> 01:52:18.989
- Oh, mate.
- Yeah?

01:52:19.531 --> 01:52:20.908
I wanted bubble milk tea.

01:52:20.991 --> 01:52:22.159
How about a wagon wheel?

01:52:52.397 --> 01:52:53.607
A father...

01:52:54.274 --> 01:52:55.317
Protects his family.

01:54:27.868 --> 01:54:30.913
Oh, fuck.

01:54:34.291 --> 01:54:37.377
About your wife,
I had nothing to do with that.

01:54:38.086 --> 01:54:39.171
It's a mistake.

01:54:39.296 --> 01:54:40.964
I'm not carver.

01:54:42.382 --> 01:54:44.843
I only do snatch-and-grab jobs.

01:54:45.427 --> 01:54:48.805
The carver! I want the carver!
I hired the carver!

01:54:48.889 --> 01:54:51.308
No, he had a stomach thing, man.

01:54:51.391 --> 01:54:52.976
I'm just filling in.

01:54:57.689 --> 01:54:59.149
You're filling in.

01:54:59.233 --> 01:55:02.194
For what it's worth, carver is a dick.

01:55:02.277 --> 01:55:04.279
The most cunning assassin...?

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.240
Maybe the laziest.

01:55:15.749 --> 01:55:17.376
Aw, come on.

01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:19.920
Just let it go, bro.

01:55:20.003 --> 01:55:22.798
Do not call me "bro"!

01:55:24.424 --> 01:55:25.509
Okay.

01:55:41.441 --> 01:55:42.609
Dude, did you see that?

01:55:43.527 --> 01:55:44.527
What was that?

01:55:51.118 --> 01:55:52.160
Dude.

01:55:54.079 --> 01:55:55.247
It's done.

01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:12.973
Hey, about this plum. Shouldn't the plum
give up all resentment? Like...

01:56:14.933 --> 01:56:16.476
Oh, my god.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.815
It's my luck that delivered
my father's corpse at my feet.

01:56:21.899 --> 01:56:24.401
The narcissism on this chick.

01:56:24.484 --> 01:56:25.527
Untreatable.

01:56:25.652 --> 01:56:27.029
Now I am...

01:56:27.112 --> 01:56:29.114
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:56:29.198 --> 01:56:30.115
What?

01:56:30.199 --> 01:56:32.576
What is with this fucked-up family?

01:56:33.493 --> 01:56:35.787
You need some suggested reading,
if I may.

01:56:36.455 --> 01:56:38.332
Surviving borderline personality disorder.

01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:39.415
What?

01:56:39.458 --> 01:56:40.584
I highly recommend it.

01:56:40.667 --> 01:56:43.712
Now I am the white d...

01:56:46.798 --> 01:56:47.798
What was that?

01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:52.888
Was that Karma?

01:56:52.971 --> 01:56:55.557
Farewell, tentoumushi.

01:56:58.185 --> 01:56:59.269
Tangerine.

01:57:16.912 --> 01:57:17.996
Maria?

01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:19.164
Take the gun.

01:57:19.248 --> 01:57:20.791
Oh, my god, did you just say "whack"?

01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:23.377
We're almost there.
You just need to get up.

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.170
Did you come to rescue me?

01:57:26.171 --> 01:57:27.548
Did you need rescuing?

01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:29.299
You came to rescue me.

01:57:29.383 --> 01:57:30.884
Please don't make me regret it.

01:57:32.553 --> 01:57:36.807
Okay, don't. Don't. What's happening
to your face? Are you crying?

01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:38.308
It's a lot to process.

01:57:39.059 --> 01:57:42.020
I want you to know, you are the greatest,

01:57:42.104 --> 01:57:44.731
most wonderful handler

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:47.693
that I could ever have. Ever. Ever.

01:57:48.277 --> 01:57:50.946
Do you think maybe
there was a little head trauma?

01:57:51.029 --> 01:57:52.781
- Maybe.
- Little bit, yeah.

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:55.284
- A little lightheaded.
- Yeah. Need a banana?

01:57:55.367 --> 01:57:57.536
- Potassium might be good.
- Have one in the car.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:58.954
Hey.

01:57:59.037 --> 01:58:01.832
Next time, take the gun.
Don't listen to Barry.

01:58:01.915 --> 01:58:03.750
Okay? Simple.

01:58:06.336 --> 01:58:07.588
Stop it.

01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:09.423
- Stop.
- You know,

01:58:09.506 --> 01:58:12.092
- I think you were right about one thing.
- Usually am. Come on.

01:58:12.634 --> 01:58:14.928
Maybe it is just about how we frame it.

01:58:15.012 --> 01:58:17.014
Like, maybe there's no bad luck
or good luck.

01:58:17.097 --> 01:58:18.849
Maybe we're all just agents of fate.

01:58:19.975 --> 01:58:21.560
- Nice car.
- Yes, it is.

01:58:21.643 --> 01:58:22.811
Try not to bleed on it.

01:58:29.985 --> 01:58:32.487
Holy mol...

01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:35.907
Well...

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:39.536
How do you know it's a bad thing?

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:42.748
Really?

01:58:42.831 --> 01:58:44.833
- See what I'm doing?
- I do.

01:58:44.917 --> 01:58:46.919
- Turning that upside down.
- I do.

01:58:48.295 --> 01:58:49.295
This is working.

01:58:50.339 --> 01:58:51.339
Yeah.

01:58:57.554 --> 01:58:58.889
Wasabi peas.

01:58:59.515 --> 01:59:01.892
Fate obviously didn't want me
to have that banana.

01:59:02.017 --> 01:59:04.186
Fate did not want us
to get in that car.

01:59:04.269 --> 01:59:06.730
Well, maybe you've learned something
after all.

01:59:07.731 --> 01:59:09.691
Fate needs me to find a smart toilet.

01:59:09.775 --> 01:59:12.486
- I take that back. Can you hold it?
- I'm ballpointing.

01:59:12.569 --> 01:59:15.280
- Walk faster.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:42.891
I'm alive! I'm Ali...

01:59:43.559 --> 01:59:45.811
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.

01:59:49.898 --> 01:59:51.024
Come on, you fucker.

01:59:51.650 --> 01:59:52.693
Fuck you!

01:59:57.155 --> 01:59:58.824
Stop! Fucking stop!

02:00:01.952 --> 02:00:03.078
Tangerines.

02:00:03.161 --> 02:00:04.413
Fuck diesels.

02:00:05.038 --> 02:00:07.583
- I am the white d...
- Fuck you, diesel bitch!

02:00:09.877 --> 02:00:14.173
Final curtain, huh? Final curtain!
Take a fucking bow!
