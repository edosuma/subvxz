00:46.961 --> 00:48.791
In the land of Sparta,

00:49.031 --> 00:49.991
When babies were born,

00:50.372 --> 00:54.501
The elders would inspect them
for defects

00:55.575 --> 00:58.561
Ah! Are you my mama?

00:58.946 --> 01:00.866
Because I am ready,
to suck your tits!

01:09.296 --> 01:11.836
If any imperfections were found...

01:11.836 --> 01:13.565
The baby was rejected.

01:15.389 --> 01:17.310
And if the baby was Vietnamese,

01:17.988 --> 01:20.870
Branjelina had first dips.

01:25.092 --> 01:25.908
Cute, huh?

01:26.864 --> 01:29.518
Behold, Leonidas...

01:29.051 --> 01:30.997
Awoo!

01:31.237 --> 01:32.691
The perfect Spartan.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.184
At an early age,

01:41.616 --> 01:43.258
Leonidas was taught to fight.

01:43.498 --> 01:45.285
Come on, you little shit.
Come on!

01:45.621 --> 01:48.827
You can't beat me!
You're never gonna be a Spartan. Never!

01:49.068 --> 01:50.303
Take this, granny!

01:54.692 --> 01:57.573
He was tortured.
Torture showed no pain.

01:59.347 --> 02:02.265
Tell me, Mr. Bond.
What is the account number?

02:02.505 --> 02:04.527
Who the hell is Mr. Bond?

02:04.767 --> 02:06.175
I am Leonidas.

02:06.392 --> 02:08.217
You are testing my patience, double o'

02:08.294 --> 02:11.367
I am not double ohh...

02:15.071 --> 02:17.013
Little Miss Sunshine!

02:18.610 --> 02:21.056
It's a nice one, huh?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.561
It's not going in your mouth,
this one.

02:24.293 --> 02:28.327
Alright there. Mr. Bond,
I would like you to meet Captain Adorable

02:29.573 --> 02:31.450
Good boy! Who's a good boy!

02:35.022 --> 02:37.587
Leonidas was sent into the wild...

02:37.827 --> 02:39.988
To learn how to survive.

02:45.016 --> 02:47.465
He prayed to the elements...

02:47.841 --> 02:50.050
Endured starvation...

02:58.577 --> 03:02.227
No mayo?
This is bullshit!

03:05.406 --> 03:07.951
The beast stalks Leonidas...

03:09.039 --> 03:12.881
Red eyes glowing like
the fires of Hell!

03:30.610 --> 03:32.531
Man, you've got Happy Feet!

03:33.305 --> 03:36.364
I am about to shove up my
Happy Foot up your ass, crackum!

03:36.604 --> 03:38.020
Nice penguin!

03:37.113 --> 03:38.686
Where are you going, pussy?

03:42.038 --> 03:44.015
I'm about to make you my
bitch, Leonidas!

03:47.282 --> 03:52.065
- The taco barely sitting right here.
- Oh, stop!

03:52.305 --> 03:53.686
Caught you with
your mouth open!

04:05.406 --> 04:06.630
You're dead Leonidas.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.055
Say, 'Wazzup!' to Anna Nicole.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.007
Shit, I'm stuck! Oh my God, we've got a
penguin penned down!

04:16.220 --> 04:17.505
Help! Help!

04:25.063 --> 04:26.217
My ass!

04:26.458 --> 04:27.814
My ass hurts! Uhh!

04:28.726 --> 04:30.020
Why do you want to do
me like that?

04:30.260 --> 04:31.433
Come on, man!

04:31.112 --> 04:33.205
I could hook you up!
We could work it out!

04:33.445 --> 04:34.930
I was just joke...

04:39.537 --> 04:42.418
And the boy that was
tossed into the wild...

04:42.692 --> 04:44.943
...returned a king!

05:25.531 --> 05:27.452
Wow!

05:29.566 --> 05:31.487
Boobs!

05:36.674 --> 05:38.403
Sign my rock!

05:39.354 --> 05:41.140
And they're real too!

05:41.380 --> 05:41.861
Yes!

05:45.899 --> 05:46.860
Marry me?

05:54.519 --> 05:57.422
- What's that?
- The combination to my chasity belt

06:16.182 --> 06:18.279
Leonidas was stoked.

06:19.621 --> 06:22.860
He wed Margo and she bore him
a fine son.

06:24.604 --> 06:27.485
And life in the land of Sparta
was good.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.143
Yes! Yes!
Good!

06:32.380 --> 06:33.299
Thanks Dad!

06:37.248 --> 06:40.059
Give me your hand.
Remember son!

06:40.881 --> 06:43.241
A warrior must learn
to take a hit!

06:45.619 --> 06:46.846
Fight with your head,

06:47.609 --> 06:49.104
Think with your heart.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.924
Give him the 'Piledriver', honey.

06:53.876 --> 06:54.761
The 'Piledriver'?

07:00.267 --> 07:01.189
That's my boy.

07:09.678 --> 07:11.372
- My Queen!
- Captain!

07:13.053 --> 07:16.128
I can see Leonidas is holding our future
king of Sparta to be a man.

07:20.555 --> 07:23.292
I remember when my father
used to beat me.

07:24.336 --> 07:26.257
The traditional rites of passage.

07:27.444 --> 07:29.069
No, my father was an alcoholic.

07:35.447 --> 07:37.704
Xerxes' messenger awaits,
my King.

07:44.771 --> 07:47.653
- Greetings, Leonidas!
- Greetings, messenger!

07:51.319 --> 07:52.109
What the hell was that?

07:52.349 --> 07:54.327
- What?
- You just kissed me!

07:54.700 --> 07:57.646
That is how men of Sparta
greet each other.

07:57.516 --> 07:58.621
High-fives for the women...

07:59.799 --> 08:02.851
...and open-mouth tongue kisses
for the men.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.634
- I get it.
- Get what?

08:16.527 --> 08:18.894
You have a free society.

08:19.073 --> 08:20.094
Yes!

08:20.295 --> 08:22.792
- The freest!
- Not that there is anything wrong with that!

08:29.272 --> 08:31.318
I take big, black dudes.

08:32.648 --> 08:33.522
Yeah!

08:34.508 --> 08:36.657
Come messenger, let us walk!

08:41.255 --> 08:44.895
The great Xerxes has taken over the
world with his vast Persian army.

08:45.912 --> 08:47.889
He has set his sights
with his final conquest.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.612
Sparta!

08:53.497 --> 08:55.830
Let us talk by the giant
Pit of Death.

08:56.388 --> 08:58.069
Okay!

08:57.935 --> 08:59.671
Xerxes is a kind God King,

08:59.859 --> 09:02.776
and offers these peaceful alternatives
to war!

09:05.599 --> 09:07.597
No blood will be shed

09:06.754 --> 09:08.888
As long as you Spartan men
with his spirits

09:09.984 --> 09:12.972
You women... become his
sex slaves!

09:13.185 --> 09:17.987
And your children... work in sweat
shops, making Nikes.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.204
That sounds reasonable.

09:23.561 --> 09:25.482
I'm sure you would think so,
Counselman Treathero.

09:55.089 --> 09:56.280
Tell Xerxes,

09:58.486 --> 10:00.379
To take his proporsal,

10:01.478 --> 10:02.541
and shove it...

10:03.945 --> 10:05.185
What the hell?

10:05.487 --> 10:06.447
What? He came onto me!

10:07.511 --> 10:09.432
I did not! Dawg,
your wife's a ho!

10:13.141 --> 10:14.574
This means war!

10:15.831 --> 10:18.533
Hey, hey, it's cool!
It's cool!

10:17.734 --> 10:21.057
We've got San Franciso.
And West Hollywood. We don't need Sparta.

10:21.649 --> 10:23.086
I'll just tell Xerxes
it's a no-go!

10:30.883 --> 10:31.844
Kick his ass in!

10:35.682 --> 10:36.720
This is madness!

10:37.828 --> 10:39.301
Madness?

10:41.964 --> 10:44.179
This... is... Sparta!

10:52.389 --> 10:53.671
Why did you do that?
He was backing down!

10:58.323 --> 11:00.966
My Lord, he will tell Xerxes
that Sparta is not in war with them...

11:01.104 --> 11:03.378
...so whatever you do,
don't kick him into the Pit of Death!

11:03.480 --> 11:05.914
Stop kicking people into the
Pit of Death! Really!

11:13.545 --> 11:16.286
I wonder why y'all always
have my back for everything!

11:17.187 --> 11:20.221
I am a responsible adult!
Look at me... I'm booby-feeding my baby!

11:20.413 --> 11:24.572
Sometimes I like to give him pridemilk. I call them
milkpoppers. It's just like breastmilk but it's fried

11:24.813 --> 11:27.694
And you just pop it into their mouth!
He loves it, don't you, baby!

11:34.312 --> 11:35.273
I am a smart shopper

11:35.468 --> 11:38.349
I got this entire outfit in an alleyway
from a Mexican woman!

11:38.505 --> 11:41.533
Bagging, shopping, yeah!

11:42.178 --> 11:43.573
Why do you all think I mess up?

11:43.643 --> 11:45.399
Shit, do I look crazy to you?

11:56.381 --> 11:58.302
Oh damn cuz, there goes my palimony.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.900
K-Fed ain't having it, yo!

12:16.806 --> 12:19.684
I am not gay!

12:21.830 --> 12:24.269
- Leonidas!
- Bryan Seaquest?

12:25.002 --> 12:28.222
Let's see what the judges
have to say. Randy!

12:28.342 --> 12:30.899
Yo, Leo dawg man, I wasn't really
filling you out on that kick, dawg!

12:31.139 --> 12:32.689
Just alright, dawg!

12:32.612 --> 12:37.170
- Paula?
- You move me!

12:41.076 --> 12:41.834
Simon?

12:42.593 --> 12:48.086
- I thought that kick was utterly... dreadful!
- Oh, Simon!

12:49.761 --> 12:53.626
In fact I have seen better kicks
from a geriatric donkey.

12:53.780 --> 12:56.141
- And I am not talking about you, Paula!
- Oh that's so mean!

12:56.471 --> 12:58.085
Oh, go (bleep) yourselves!

13:06.714 --> 13:08.635
Seaquest comes!

13:09.414 --> 13:11.335
Excellent work, my king.

13:12.133 --> 13:14.054
It's time to consult
the prophets.

13:28.049 --> 13:30.734
The ancient prophets were advisors
to the King.

13:30.974 --> 13:36.017
Grotesque swines! Their consults
came with a swine.

13:40.493 --> 13:43.380
Ohh, Oxytan... Nutrogina...

13:44.100 --> 13:47.221
This has a SPF.
This is all day protection.

13:46.882 --> 13:49.174
Look at this...
Expoliate Hydroxide!

13:49.985 --> 13:53.268
This is good for you man,
rub it all over your disgusting face!

13:54.538 --> 13:57.100
What need you, King Leonidas?

13:57.672 --> 13:59.315
Ancient prophets...

13:59.347 --> 14:01.220
I need your guidance.

14:01.645 --> 14:04.928
I am assembling an army of 300 to
go to war with Persia

14:05.422 --> 14:08.256
I'm going to take them,
to the rear.

14:08.688 --> 14:10.785
And then I'm gonna reach around...

14:11.553 --> 14:13.292
...and I'm gonna take them up
on the front!

14:14.919 --> 14:17.891
What?
Why are you snickering?

14:18.213 --> 14:20.396
Nothing, really!
It's nothing.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.451
What's so damn funny?

14:22.894 --> 14:24.252
Look, it's all there for you
to see!

14:24.540 --> 14:27.103
It's a battle formation!

14:25.951 --> 14:29.737
Well, it's because it looks backstage
in an Elton John concert.

14:31.466 --> 14:34.124
Cut it out! This isn't funny.
This is serious business.

14:34.694 --> 14:41.657
No Spartan goes to war without them
consulting... the Oracle

15:00.950 --> 15:05.075
The prophets chose only the most
beautiful of Spartan girls...

15:05.490 --> 15:07.513
...to be their Oracle.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.426
- Ugly Betty?
- She has a great personality.

15:19.291 --> 15:21.020
Ooh.

15:20.535 --> 15:23.419
I look like Jabba the Hut.
That is hot to me.

15:43.145 --> 15:45.066
Oh!

15:49.426 --> 15:51.793
Well, she doesn't... mind it...

15:55.876 --> 15:59.161
'Save the cheerleader,
save the world'

15:59.178 --> 16:01.897
Actually, I'm not into
Heroes.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.574
- Deuschbag says, 'What?'
- What?

16:09.033 --> 16:11.081
- Chestwax says ,'What?'
- What?

16:13.508 --> 16:15.429
You are...

16:15.292 --> 16:17.930
What, what are you saying to me?
I don't understand!

16:17.965 --> 16:20.647
Go to war with Persia
and you will surely die!

16:23.826 --> 16:25.854
You're screwed, dude!

16:49.947 --> 16:50.991
What?

16:54.455 --> 16:56.400
He looks like a 'Ken' doll.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.144
It's cold.

17:30.688 --> 17:32.339
Borat?

17:40.382 --> 17:41.893
Why is my prince so restless?

17:43.648 --> 17:44.618
I can't sleep.

17:45.938 --> 17:48.505
It's this whole battle of the
modernary thing.

17:48.761 --> 17:51.738
Are you still thinking about what
the young Oracle said?

17:53.899 --> 17:56.469
There is only one woman who's words
you should listen to.

17:58.089 --> 18:00.049
- Oprah?
- Your wife?

18:00.856 --> 18:01.909
Right, right!

18:03.600 --> 18:05.786
How will I be tried in the court
of public opinion?

18:08.759 --> 18:11.305
Well, Harry knows at 'Ain't It
Cool News'

18:11.561 --> 18:14.447
says this movie is just a cheap
rip-off of '300'.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.815
Even if the Oracle doesn't support you,

18:23.070 --> 18:24.705
I do... and Sparta does.

18:26.090 --> 18:28.216
This could be our last night together.

18:29.196 --> 18:30.492
Do you wanna do it?

18:30.740 --> 18:32.167
Like we never done it before?

18:54.547 --> 18:57.547
97... 98...

18:58.168 --> 19:01.694
99... 100!

19:01.891 --> 19:03.414
Beat my record!

19:10.709 --> 19:12.729
- Captain!
- My King!

19:14.511 --> 19:17.212
Have you assembled my army
who are ready to fight for death...

19:17.445 --> 19:18.858
...for the freedom of Sparta?

19:19.106 --> 19:19.992
Yes, King!

19:26.907 --> 19:27.936
I wanted 300.

19:29.177 --> 19:31.820
This seems like... less.

19:31.855 --> 19:34.294
These were the only men
that meant with the specific expectations.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.346
Hunky with Deep Mediterranean tens.

19:38.021 --> 19:39.942
Hot bods and...

19:40.617 --> 19:42.933
- Yes?
- Well, undowed.

19:45.759 --> 19:47.675
We are ready to fight for you,
My King!

19:47.869 --> 19:51.734
Never give up, never surrender!
To infinity, and beyond!

19:54.843 --> 19:55.908
He has lot of heart, my king...

19:56.420 --> 19:57.907
...and nice man boobs.

20:02.275 --> 20:03.318
Indeed.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.932
These men will do.

20:07.547 --> 20:10.282
You are a fine captain, Captain.

20:10.494 --> 20:12.231
A better friend...

20:12.461 --> 20:15.388
- ...there is none.
-- Thank you!

20:26.936 --> 20:28.142
Thank you.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.351
He's got a huge package.

20:42.701 --> 20:43.953
My father!

20:46.087 --> 20:47.625
Very well, my son.

20:49.557 --> 20:50.627
Introductions?

20:50.872 --> 20:52.701
Leonidas, this is my son, Soniel.

20:53.523 --> 20:54.411
My King.

20:54.623 --> 20:56.006
Why is he not fighting?

20:56.734 --> 20:57.807
He is not a warrior.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.776
He's my only son just on
to carry my name.

21:03.812 --> 21:05.146
What do you think?

21:05.086 --> 21:06.745
Yummy!

21:07.129 --> 21:08.669
Work it, sister.

21:09.730 --> 21:11.556
I think he's Venus.

21:18.245 --> 21:21.107
And if you do not like it...
You can kiss my fat ass!

21:23.860 --> 21:25.349
Ooh!

21:28.130 --> 21:29.461
Congratulations, Soniel.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.889
You are now on a new way on
becoming Sparta's next new warrior.

21:43.907 --> 21:45.445
Spartan?

21:53.920 --> 21:55.270
My child!

21:56.082 --> 21:57.546
I shall never forget you,

21:58.371 --> 21:59.995
You are so small now...

22:00.696 --> 22:02.608
...but one day you will grow to be
big and strong...

22:02.897 --> 22:04.512
...like your father.

22:04.413 --> 22:05.953
That's not your son.

22:07.676 --> 22:08.962
You asshole!

22:16.802 --> 22:18.201
Take care of your mother.

22:21.838 --> 22:23.156
Stay tough, son.

22:29.209 --> 22:31.815
Come back with your shield...
or on it.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.645
And if I come back on it...

22:33.845 --> 22:35.374
...I want you to move on.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.403
I would never.

22:38.189 --> 22:39.653
And if you died,
I'd pay the bill.

22:39.931 --> 22:41.638
To be honest...

22:41.823 --> 22:43.721
I have always wanted to do
a fat chick.

23:12.070 --> 23:12.934
The men are ready, my King.

23:15.307 --> 23:17.436
We'll head set to the Hot Gates

23:17.661 --> 23:19.621
Where we'll intercept the Persian army.

23:19.896 --> 23:20.696
Where are you going?

23:20.842 --> 23:23.176
The Oracle says if we went to war,
we would be screwed.

23:23.406 --> 23:26.682
The Oracle also said that our
painted-on abs...

23:26.866 --> 23:28.058
...look fake.

23:28.278 --> 23:29.316
But I beg to differ.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.404
Give the order, Captain.

23:41.685 --> 23:43.576
Spartans, in formation!

23:55.241 --> 23:56.173
Move on!

23:58.811 --> 24:02.077
# Oh no, not I.
I will survive #

24:02.326 --> 24:05.255
# Oh, as long as I know how I love #

24:05.235 --> 24:06.964
# I'll know I'll survive #

24:06.881 --> 24:08.706
# I've got all my life to live #

24:08.762 --> 24:10.683
# I've got all my love to give #

24:10.662 --> 24:12.487
# And I will survive. #

24:12.573 --> 24:14.205
# I will survive. #

24:14.297 --> 24:16.218
# Hey, hey! #

24:16.407 --> 24:18.328
- Hmm, hmm.
- Whoo!

24:36.573 --> 24:39.309
The fearless Spartans reached
the 'Hot Gates'...

24:39.405 --> 24:42.615
...when danger lurked around
every corner.

24:45.569 --> 24:47.349
Halt, skipping!

24:51.256 --> 24:52.767
Exhausted from their journey...

24:53.208 --> 24:56.483
The Spartans replenished their
electro-lives.

25:03.295 --> 25:06.151
Gay drink!
Is it in you?

25:12.882 --> 25:14.465
What do you think,
my king?

25:14.609 --> 25:16.839
We'll use the narrow
passage by the Hot Gates...

25:17.159 --> 25:19.010
...to funnel the Persians in...

25:19.058 --> 25:21.861
...where their vast numbers
won't count for shit!

25:22.286 --> 25:25.140
Captain, have the men found
any other trails...

25:25.063 --> 25:26.888
...that the Persians could use to attack us?

25:27.455 --> 25:29.069
None, sir!

25:29.355 --> 25:31.132
I know such a road, my king.

25:39.153 --> 25:40.998
Back off,
you hideous creature!

25:41.500 --> 25:43.462
There is a secret bow-path,
just below the Hot Gates.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.478
If the Persians found it,
they can not find you.

25:45.773 --> 25:47.471
Slow your role, Captain.

25:49.426 --> 25:51.204
Reveal yourself, creature.

25:54.740 --> 25:56.625
- Paris Hilton?
- Hey, fellas!

25:56.912 --> 25:58.224
What happened to you?

25:58.789 --> 26:00.716
Oh, you mean the hump?

26:01.767 --> 26:03.129
Yeah, the hump!

26:03.525 --> 26:06.624
It was all that, 'You're going to jail.
Now you can get out of jail'

26:06.864 --> 26:09.498
'Now you can go back to jail!'
And on, and on, and on. Uhh!

26:11.527 --> 26:14.574
It's just been totally confusing.
Even Tinkerbell's affected by it.

26:15.405 --> 26:18.235
She hasn't moved since Saturday. She
still poops which is weird.

26:19.198 --> 26:22.310
And me! They have turned me
into this... like...

26:22.580 --> 26:26.408
...totally grotesque monster!
And I don't even know what...

26:26.696 --> 26:27.909
Oh!

26:34.218 --> 26:37.008
Hello? Oh, hey Nicole!

26:37.484 --> 26:39.335
Nothing, just some guys
with their swords.

26:39.790 --> 26:42.497
No, I'm talking about their actual swords.
Nicole, you're gross.

26:42.415 --> 26:44.192
Now, I'm hungry.
Did you eat?

26:44.716 --> 26:47.508
Oh, you ate an almond?
Oh yea, you're done eating for the day.

26:47.737 --> 26:49.508
Bye, sexy ...

26:51.441 --> 26:54.346
Look, it's my dream
to be a Spartan.

26:54.731 --> 26:55.861
What can you do?

26:56.845 --> 26:58.028
Have you seen my video?

26:59.298 --> 27:00.288
Oh yeah!

27:01.501 --> 27:03.325
She's pretty good.

27:03.703 --> 27:05.822
I am sorry, but we can not use you.

27:07.846 --> 27:10.569
No, it's not fair!

27:12.839 --> 27:14.602
Mom!

27:16.312 --> 27:18.743
I am not as stupid
as I look!

27:22.916 --> 27:23.581
Help!

27:23.531 --> 27:25.452
Look, Persians!

28:03.236 --> 28:04.458
I am the emmisary...

28:04.715 --> 28:06.757
...to the great God-king, Xerxes...

28:07.007 --> 28:09.368
...come to accept your surrender.

28:09.723 --> 28:11.667
Oh, we're not here to
surrender.

28:16.151 --> 28:18.843
Xexes will enjoy making you
his slaves.

28:41.255 --> 28:46.299
- Spartans! Let's battle!
- Yeah!

28:47.123 --> 28:49.208
Oh, we're about to
stomp the yard.

28:54.891 --> 28:57.895
We are Spartans,
we stomp the yard!

28:58.691 --> 28:59.947
Check out our bods!

29:04.721 --> 29:06.065
Ooh, ooh!

29:05.922 --> 29:08.717
Spartans! Yea!

29:13.299 --> 29:14.825
Persians!

29:15.663 --> 29:18.602
Let's show them what we National Champs
for 3 years, running.

29:18.848 --> 29:20.769
You dig?!

29:26.066 --> 29:27.883
Oh, come on!

29:33.977 --> 29:39.086
Ooh, ahh! Ooh, ahh!
Perrrsians!

29:50.475 --> 29:51.771
# You gotta shake your ass #

29:51.893 --> 29:53.471
Let's go!

30:29.745 --> 30:31.186
Oh, please!

31:41.429 --> 31:43.013
Oooh!

31:43.424 --> 31:47.374
Don't come up in my kitchen
with that weaker shit!

31:47.610 --> 31:49.339
# You gotta shake your ass #

32:10.622 --> 32:12.475
You got served!

32:32.370 --> 32:35.176
- Are you telling me we lost?
- Dance them to the cliffs!

32:36.675 --> 32:41.371
Come on, man! Can we talk about this? Oh, I just met
these goons right here. I don't even know them!

33:15.907 --> 33:19.478
We may have won the battle.
But they will win the war!

33:19.870 --> 33:21.244
Hah! What?

33:22.315 --> 33:25.154
Budmeister presents...
Real Men of Genius!

33:28.510 --> 33:32.937
Today we salute you,
Mr. War-Mongering Latened Homosexuals

33:36.217 --> 33:39.399
Wearing nothing but leather underwear and
a cape you charge your enemy...

33:39.499 --> 33:41.276
...like an oil-upped hairless
wonder!

33:43.888 --> 33:47.474
Sure there's danger! Charging rhinos,
stampeding elephants...

33:47.602 --> 33:51.396
...and that cute togo wearing guy
named 'Chad'.

33:51.892 --> 33:56.186
You only went out on one date
but you'll remember it forever!

33:59.954 --> 34:04.724
Your king's instincts tell you to cut,
slice and chop every man you see...

34:05.476 --> 34:08.020
But enough about your career as
a hair-stylist.

34:08.027 --> 34:09.532
Let's talk war.

34:11.505 --> 34:13.764
So this Bud's for you
King Leonidas!

34:14.521 --> 34:17.885
Because when the going gets tough,
the tough go and ticking

34:26.768 --> 34:29.152
Queen Margo,
we must speak!

34:32.783 --> 34:33.378
What do you want?

34:36.868 --> 34:38.404
Nice tomatoes!

34:39.135 --> 34:41.655
Your husband...
needs you.

34:42.835 --> 34:46.489
You must convince the council to send
more troops to support your husband.

34:47.181 --> 34:48.766
My husband is dead...

34:48.918 --> 34:52.900
...he told me to move on.
Besides, I'm already registered on J-Day

34:52.954 --> 34:55.742
A little to the right...
That's it!

34:56.108 --> 34:58.849
Leonidas fails,
Xerxes will take over...

34:59.006 --> 35:01.279
...and you will be stripped
of your crown.

35:01.844 --> 35:03.813
I won't be Queen?

35:04.108 --> 35:05.294
Auw, it's too hard.

35:06.078 --> 35:07.503
We'll lose everything.

35:07.631 --> 35:09.104
The palace...

35:10.821 --> 35:14.149
- Your Nintendo Wii...
- No, no, no! Oww!

35:14.550 --> 35:16.672
Your 20 inch rims in your Escalade...

35:17.940 --> 35:19.253
...your gardener!

35:22.442 --> 35:23.355
Antonio?

35:39.506 --> 35:40.796
My husband needs me!

35:41.367 --> 35:42.895
I'll do whatever it takes!

35:43.126 --> 35:44.872
I'll accept the meeting with
the council.

35:45.209 --> 35:46.767
But in order to win their vote,

35:47.422 --> 35:49.943
You need to get traitorers
as your supporter.

35:52.097 --> 35:55.636
He holds great influence.
The Council.

36:03.923 --> 36:06.902
King Leonidas,
Xerxes approaches!

36:08.423 --> 36:12.531
Xerxes! He seems as much at that
Fat guy from the movie of Borat.

36:19.411 --> 36:23.291
- I am the great God King Xerxes. Oww!
- Ooh!

36:25.917 --> 36:29.423
Oww, oww, oww!

36:30.885 --> 36:33.335
- Ohh!
- Ahh!

36:48.737 --> 36:50.370
Damn!

36:53.334 --> 36:56.938
- I'm sorry, Xerxes!
- It's cool! It's cool, cool! I'm fine.

36:57.104 --> 36:58.520
I meant to do that.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.154
Oh, shit!

37:01.363 --> 37:02.893
I tell you, kid...
you got balls!

37:03.079 --> 37:05.883
I come over here with a big army,
and we're gonna sheesh kabab your ass.

37:06.535 --> 37:08.118
Before this battle is over,

37:08.641 --> 37:11.766
people will know that even
a God-king could fall.

37:12.275 --> 37:14.684
Listen Leo, I came here to talk.

37:15.007 --> 37:16.888
Just listen to my deal.

37:19.391 --> 37:20.840
Ladies!

37:20.856 --> 37:23.128
Hi Xerxes!

37:25.450 --> 37:26.920
That's probably for me.

37:28.315 --> 37:31.801
Hello. Really? Okay!

37:33.660 --> 37:37.352
That was the banker. He's offering to buy
back your briefcase...

37:37.579 --> 37:40.082
...for a week and
getaway for two...

37:40.353 --> 37:42.358
...in Las Vegas, Nevada...

37:42.598 --> 37:44.173
...in the Palms Hotel and Casino.

37:45.144 --> 37:46.733
I always wanted to go there!

37:46.541 --> 37:49.609
All you have to do...
is bow down to me

37:51.523 --> 37:53.444
And surrender Sparta.

37:54.391 --> 37:57.117
Deal... or no deal?

38:00.694 --> 38:03.189
- Take the deal!
- No!

38:03.384 --> 38:05.559
Take the deal, take the deal!

38:05.561 --> 38:06.690
What about Sparta?

38:06.979 --> 38:10.147
- Hit the button!
- Yes, take the deal, take the deal!

38:11.886 --> 38:13.711
Hit the button!

38:14.340 --> 38:15.493
Hit it.

38:16.602 --> 38:19.116
- No deal!
- Aww, damn!

38:20.529 --> 38:22.563
By the time I'm
finished with you...

38:22.913 --> 38:24.788
...Sparta will be
annihilated.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.036
It will be as though it
never existed.

38:27.694 --> 38:30.328
I will see to it that you're
written out of the history books.

38:31.569 --> 38:33.719
Well, that's fine,
my mean Xerxes...

38:35.223 --> 38:37.165
Because I can't read.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.449
Xerxes didn't take rejection well.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.415
From every corner of his empire,

38:45.932 --> 38:48.379
He sent his most vicious warriors
to fight.

38:48.985 --> 38:53.373
Yo mama so ghetto, when she
brest-feeds cool-oil comes out!

39:00.125 --> 39:01.507
Yo mama so stupid she thought...

39:01.425 --> 39:04.510
...2Pac Shakur was a
Jewish Holiday

39:13.345 --> 39:14.691
Yo mama so fat, her...

39:14.905 --> 39:17.941
...pant size is umm...
'Bitch-Lose-Some-Weight'!

39:20.323 --> 39:23.210
Yo mama so foot, Rosie O'
Donnel wouldn't even date her!

39:23.831 --> 39:25.656
Oh, you did it!
No, you didn't!

39:27.146 --> 39:29.480
Well, yo mama titties
are smaller than yours!

39:32.926 --> 39:34.764
Those tits are my
bitches!

39:35.004 --> 39:36.093
Yo mama so fat...

39:36.235 --> 39:40.286
...so they decided that he doesn't
like big butts. And he ain't lyin'!

39:43.769 --> 39:46.217
Aww, oh, my eyes!

39:49.212 --> 39:50.941
How you like that, huh?

39:53.502 --> 39:55.929
Yo mama so fat that when
she farts...

39:56.165 --> 39:58.623
...Al Gore accuses her of
global warming, dawg!

40:02.233 --> 40:05.290
Yes, well that maybe the case but
yo mama so hairy,

40:05.562 --> 40:07.403
the only language she speaks...

40:07.673 --> 40:10.954
...is wookie! Brrrr!
Brrrr!

40:25.071 --> 40:27.508
Xerxes watched as his warriors
were defeated.

40:28.747 --> 40:31.614
It sent an all human chill-up
to his spine...

40:32.901 --> 40:35.947
...or perhaps that was the Dentyne Ice
with Cool-Made Crystals.

40:44.783 --> 40:46.468
Lloyl said you wanted to see me.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.987
That's my urine sample.

40:54.134 --> 40:56.041
Leonidas needs more troops.

40:56.349 --> 40:59.341
Without reinforcements,
Sparta will fall and...

41:00.197 --> 41:02.118
Blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah...

41:11.152 --> 41:13.808
I'll do anything...
for my husband.

41:16.020 --> 41:16.958
Anything?

41:21.058 --> 41:24.372
Awesome! I'm so getting laid!

41:24.774 --> 41:26.521
Goodbye, virginity!

41:27.039 --> 41:29.304
I promise you,
you're not going to enjoy this...

41:29.769 --> 41:32.367
...but I have V.D

41:33.046 --> 41:35.398
That's okay!
I have crabs.

42:02.508 --> 42:08.438
Betray your beloved Spartans.
And I'll give you anything you desire!

42:08.678 --> 42:09.714
That's hot!

42:10.178 --> 42:11.475
Bow down to me!

42:13.886 --> 42:15.949
Bend down to the great God King,

42:16.329 --> 42:17.478
Xerxes.

42:18.083 --> 42:21.542
- I am a Hilton, I don't bow!
- Ai!

42:22.243 --> 42:24.452
- But, I do bend over!
- Ah!

42:24.578 --> 42:26.589
- Good!
- There's a secret go-path between...

42:27.155 --> 42:30.947
...the Hot Gates. You can totally
use it to defeat Leonidas!

42:34.703 --> 42:36.587
And what do you desire?

42:37.041 --> 42:39.265
I want my record esponged.

42:39.699 --> 42:41.871
Oh, and I want that new Chanel purse.

42:43.437 --> 42:46.841
Thank you! I want...
throwing up to be fun!

42:47.184 --> 42:48.539
You've got something to say,
say it!

42:48.780 --> 42:49.732
I've got things to do!

42:50.402 --> 42:52.555
What was it?

42:53.008 --> 42:54.590
Oh God, jeez, yeah!

42:54.728 --> 42:56.458
I want to get this hump removed.

43:22.702 --> 43:25.973
As long as Xerxes doesn't find the
secret path to the Hot Gates...

43:27.065 --> 43:30.051
...their vast numbers won't
count for shit!

43:31.950 --> 43:33.066
My King!

43:35.698 --> 43:37.952
Catch your breath!
Vanilla blend-in.

43:39.050 --> 43:40.491
What is it, boy?

43:44.515 --> 43:47.297
Xerxes has found the secret
go-path between the Hot Gates.

43:46.850 --> 43:47.855
Oh, shit!

43:48.335 --> 43:49.404
Damn that Paris Hilton.

43:50.003 --> 43:51.202
I hate her.

43:52.122 --> 43:54.996
He's deployed a thousand of Persian soldiers.
They can be here any minute!

44:00.892 --> 44:04.835
Idilio...
How bad are your injuries?

44:05.075 --> 44:07.603
Oh, it's...
It's just a scratch, my King.

44:12.474 --> 44:13.671
You've got no eyes.

44:13.987 --> 44:15.590
The gods have blessed me
with a spare

44:16.256 --> 44:19.117
No, they haven't.
You just have the two.

44:20.133 --> 44:21.358
Jeremy has the spare.

44:26.942 --> 44:28.479
But I can still fight.

44:29.993 --> 44:33.789
Ho, Idilio... Idilio...
Idilio!

44:34.105 --> 44:37.884
- What?
- Idilio, Idillio... Idilio! Walk with me.

44:39.562 --> 44:42.064
No, no, no!

44:44.597 --> 44:47.092
Your fate is the most important!

44:49.917 --> 44:52.306
You must go back to Sparta,

44:52.226 --> 44:53.646
and tell of our tale!

44:54.314 --> 44:55.460
Yes, my King,

44:56.597 --> 44:58.616
Any message for the Queen?

45:10.867 --> 45:12.654
None that need to be said.

45:13.626 --> 45:17.322
Now go Idillio. Tell how 13 Spartans...

45:17.377 --> 45:18.486
Fought for honour...

45:18.736 --> 45:20.026
For glory...

45:20.229 --> 45:24.402
For freedom.
Good luck, Idilio.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.850
Spartans!

45:50.964 --> 45:52.371
This is your final chance.

45:52.866 --> 45:55.451
Bow down to me...
or you will die.

45:55.793 --> 45:58.382
I bow for no man!

46:04.264 --> 46:06.020
- Take a knee!
- No!

46:07.466 --> 46:08.725
- Curtsy!
- Enough!

46:11.931 --> 46:15.213
- Well, your sandle is untied.
- Oh, thanks very much!

46:15.908 --> 46:18.503
- You see, was that that difficult?
- Wait, no!

46:18.472 --> 46:21.082
- Atatatata! No, no!
- No, I wasn't bowing! I wasn't bowing!

46:21.130 --> 46:23.333
- I was just doing my shoe!
- No, no!

46:23.573 --> 46:26.122
You acknowledge me as your God-king.
High-five!

46:29.798 --> 46:30.999
What?

46:33.143 --> 46:34.730
What, what, what the hell is so funny?

46:34.918 --> 46:36.380
- You!
- Me?

46:36.620 --> 46:38.277
You greet like women.

46:38.617 --> 46:41.624
You idiots are wearing banana panties
and you're laughing at me?

46:41.869 --> 46:44.411
Now you're pissing me off!
I'm getting everybody!

46:45.537 --> 46:46.698
Hello, where you at?

46:46.920 --> 46:48.006
I know where I'm at.

46:48.435 --> 46:49.765
Bring in my vast army.

46:50.512 --> 46:51.691
You, 13 butts...

46:51.904 --> 46:54.088
...are no match for my massive
Persian army.

46:54.328 --> 46:55.682
They number in their millions!

47:00.940 --> 47:02.557
That's just a blue screen!

47:03.503 --> 47:05.835
Stupid! It's a visual effect!

47:06.133 --> 47:07.876
It's going to be digitally
inserted later.

47:07.983 --> 47:10.722
And the army is quite impressive
as you can imagine.

47:17.018 --> 47:19.903
Gentlemen, I present,
Queen Margo.

47:46.001 --> 47:47.018
Shake it, baby!

47:49.133 --> 47:51.146
Okay boys,
Make it rain!

48:10.121 --> 48:10.658
Good counsilmen...

48:11.275 --> 48:13.070
I implore you.

48:14.018 --> 48:17.491
Your king... my dear husband,
needs your help.

48:17.582 --> 48:21.881
Sparta will fall if you don't agree
to send the rest of the army.

48:34.756 --> 48:37.862
Gentlemen, our only hope for survival
is to surrender to Xerxes

48:38.236 --> 48:39.760
and beg for his forgiveness.

48:40.192 --> 48:41.988
Do not be swayed by the words
of this...

48:42.744 --> 48:44.027
...woman slut!

48:46.169 --> 48:50.003
- Oh, no you didn't!
- Yes, yes I did!

48:55.246 --> 48:57.885
Queen Margo unleashed a
venomous rage.

49:01.071 --> 49:03.659
Much like Tobey Maguire
in Spider-Man 3.

49:14.303 --> 49:15.611
I'm evil!

49:20.731 --> 49:22.653
Made of sand. Oh!

49:31.426 --> 49:32.387
Oh, no!

49:41.423 --> 49:43.103
Cute!

49:44.308 --> 49:45.412
Gross!

49:55.368 --> 49:57.468
What?

49:58.381 --> 50:01.887
Oh, oh, God, oh!

50:05.442 --> 50:07.730
How you like me now,
Sandman?

50:07.226 --> 50:09.147
Oh, no!

50:10.739 --> 50:13.078
That dusting bitch, no!

50:18.321 --> 50:20.242
Aaaah!

50:34.451 --> 50:38.813
Chickel my nipples with a feather,
Xerxes is in Traitor's Top 5.

50:40.891 --> 50:43.087
Treathero was a traitor?

50:44.148 --> 50:45.204
Duh!

50:45.677 --> 50:47.377
All in favor of sending
more troops...

50:48.606 --> 50:51.780
- Say, 'I'
- I, I, I, I!

51:16.051 --> 51:18.078
Spartans!
Huh!

51:20.547 --> 51:21.667
We have you surrounded,

51:21.986 --> 51:23.519
Lay down your weapons!

51:24.184 --> 51:27.205
- Come and get them!
- For-mation!

51:33.874 --> 51:37.665
- Umm...
- The Spartan always protects another man's rear!

51:42.928 --> 51:44.186
Adjust your sword, boy!

51:44.823 --> 51:46.365
It's sticking into my back.

51:48.664 --> 51:50.243
No, I'm not wearing my sword.

51:52.964 --> 51:54.119
Carry on, then.

51:54.641 --> 51:55.693
My son?

51:57.373 --> 52:00.350
Today, you are truly a Spartan.

52:00.701 --> 52:01.579
Thank you father.

52:03.759 --> 52:05.035
Attack!

52:07.955 --> 52:09.396
Steady, Spartans.

52:19.793 --> 52:21.658
Remember this day, boys...

52:22.274 --> 52:24.920
...for today is the day
you die!

52:27.570 --> 52:28.564
What?

52:28.666 --> 52:31.588
I, I mean they will die.
Today is the day that they die.

52:31.585 --> 52:33.025
That was what I meant to say.

52:35.926 --> 52:37.079
Go on!

52:50.831 --> 52:53.203
Oh, what a bunch of dumb-shits.

52:55.970 --> 52:57.087
God, that was smart!

52:57.112 --> 53:00.281
I'm gonna go Hercules up
your ass!

54:25.173 --> 54:26.715
Ghost Rider!

54:30.148 --> 54:32.049
You go to hell.

54:34.025 --> 54:36.474
Die!

54:42.704 --> 54:45.297
Stop the war!
Stop the war!

54:58.235 --> 55:00.156
Ohh!

55:09.800 --> 55:14.431
- No!
- Yo, Sonio?

55:15.853 --> 55:18.696
- I'll knock your blocko!
- Oh, shit!

55:20.293 --> 55:22.214
Sonio!

55:34.888 --> 55:37.108
You'll pay for this, Balboa.

55:37.236 --> 55:38.295
Go for it!

55:43.960 --> 55:45.176
Adult diapers?

56:12.742 --> 56:16.079
Botox over-dose.

56:23.789 --> 56:25.990
Yes!

56:26.584 --> 56:28.505
Yea! Ha-ha!

56:29.517 --> 56:30.670
Yaa!

56:36.939 --> 56:38.091
Yes!

56:42.632 --> 56:44.477
Xerxes!

56:54.817 --> 56:57.627
It's a beautiful day.

57:00.290 --> 57:02.476
It's actually not that
attractive.

57:33.085 --> 57:34.861
# Come on, Barbie.
Let's go Barbie! # 

57:50.250 --> 57:51.306
Ooh!

58:02.421 --> 58:03.377
Shit!

58:10.857 --> 58:13.273
It's enough of this victoreous
video game violence!

58:41.684 --> 58:44.745
Ah, a Transformer cube.

58:53.931 --> 58:56.007
Okay baby,
Let's transform!

59:28.923 --> 59:35.259
I am Xerxestron, equipped with
the Trans-alien technology!

59:39.209 --> 59:41.255
Leave Buddy alone!

59:41.861 --> 59:44.850
- He is a God-king ...
- Please!

59:52.602 --> 59:54.523
Leave him alone!

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.211
Leonidas was true to
his word...

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.363
A God-king did fall!

01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:13.574
But unfortunately,
right on them!

01:00:34.344 --> 01:00:36.024
I just...

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:39.715
Ohh!

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.048
Ooh!

01:00:43.933 --> 01:00:46.270
- Queen Margo?
- Yeah!

01:01:09.322 --> 01:01:11.251
Leonidas and the Spartans,

01:01:11.564 --> 01:01:12.946
died for honour.

01:01:13.885 --> 01:01:15.338
For glory.

01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:17.964
They died.

01:01:18.157 --> 01:01:19.728
A beautiful death.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:28.492
Today, we stand against 30 thousand Persians.

01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:34.582
But we now have, a
hundred thousand soldiers!

01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:36.852
Awoo! Awoo! Awoo!

01:01:37.798 --> 01:01:38.816
To victory!

01:01:48.339 --> 01:01:50.941
Ah!
Follow me boys!

01:01:54.465 --> 01:01:58.780
Idillio blindly led the Spartans away
from the Persians...

01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:02.010
...to Mallibu...

01:02:02.623 --> 01:02:06.733
...just as Lindsay Lowhand
was leaving rehab... again!

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:21.892
# At first, I was
afraid #

01:02:22.003 --> 01:02:23.454
# I was petrified #

01:02:23.966 --> 01:02:27.062
# Kept thinking that I could never live
without you by my side #

01:02:27.647 --> 01:02:31.288
# But then I spend so many nights,
thinking how you did me wrong #

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.141
# And I grew strong #

01:02:33.122 --> 01:02:34.880
# And I learned how to get along #

01:02:35.317 --> 01:02:36.763
# And so you're back #

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:38.329
# From outer-space #

01:02:38.996 --> 01:02:42.781
# I just want them to find you here
with that sad look upon your face #

01:02:42.964 --> 01:02:47.026
# I should have just change my stupid lock,
I should have made you leave your key #

01:02:47.005 --> 01:02:50.858
# If I didn't know for just one second,
you would be back to bother me #

01:02:50.996 --> 01:02:58.604
# Go on now, go! Walk out of the door!
Just turn around now! Coz you're not welcome anymore! #

01:02:59.097 --> 01:03:06.824
# Weren't you the one who traggered hurtly by?
Do you think I'd grumble? Do you think I'd lay down and die? #

01:03:06.764 --> 01:03:10.198
# Oh no, not I.
I will survive! #

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:14.667
# Oh, as long as I know how to love,
I'll know I'll stay alive! #

01:03:15.089 --> 01:03:22.233
# I've got all my life to live! I've got all my love to give!
And I'll survive. I'll survive. #

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:40.334
Wassup, dawg?
# Took out all the strength I had #

01:03:40.573 --> 01:03:42.469
# And let the ball apart, dawg? #

01:03:42.339 --> 01:03:46.124
# Tellin' how you remember the pieces
of my broken heart #

01:03:46.147 --> 01:03:50.192
# And I spent oh, so many nights just feeling
sorry for myself #

01:03:50.633 --> 01:03:54.565
- # And I used to cry. #
- # But now I hold my hand up high! #

01:03:54.376 --> 01:03:57.787
# And you see me.
Somebody nude. #

01:03:58.193 --> 01:04:01.745
# I'm not that change-up little person
stealing love with you #

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.359
It's Britney, bitch!

01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:11.942
# Oh you fell like dropping in and just
expecting me to be free #

01:04:11.626 --> 01:04:15.478
# Now I'm savin' all my lovin'
for someone who's lovin' me #

01:04:16.664 --> 01:04:19.843
Ooh, come on!
Ahh, hah, hah!

01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:23.453
Britney's in the house. Where
my babies at? Ahh, like this.

01:04:23.635 --> 01:04:27.057
# Oh I won't. Walk out the door. #

01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:31.531
# Just turn around now.
Cause you're not welcome anymore! #

01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:36.745
# Weren't you the one who tried to wave me
goodbye. Do you think I'd grumble? #

01:04:37.084 --> 01:04:42.285
# Do you think I would lay down and die?
Oh no, not I! I will survive! #

01:04:43.298 --> 01:04:47.373
# Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive #

01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:52.351
# I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give. And I'll survive! #

01:04:53.502 --> 01:04:56.924
# And I'll survive. Hey-hey! #
