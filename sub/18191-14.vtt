WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:03.003
PREVIOUSLY ON "CHASING LIFE"...

00:03.036 --> 00:04.205
MY MOM THINKS I'M AT WORK.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.405
SWEET.
LET ME GRAB YOU A BEER.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.639
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

00:06.674 --> 00:09.143
I JUST WANT THIS
TO STOP BEING AWKWARD.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.778
CAN WE JUST CALL A TRUCE?

00:11.010 --> 00:13.314
YOU DON'T GET TO BE THE ONE
THAT CALLS A TRUCE.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.148
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.417
THERE WILL NOT BE A RIGHT TIME.

00:17.451 --> 00:21.521
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU
TO THE TUMOR WAS TRAGIC.

00:21.554 --> 00:24.257
BUT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU
LIKE THIS IS JUST STUPID.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.594
SO GLAD I WAS ABLE
TO CONVINCE YOU TO SIT DOWN
FOR A DRINK.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.463
FEELING RESTLESS PROFESSIONALLY.

00:29.496 --> 00:33.567
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT THING.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.136
YOU ARE IN PERFECT HEALTH.

00:35.168 --> 00:36.503
DOES THAT MEAN I'M GOOD
TO DONATE?

00:36.536 --> 00:40.106
WHEN THE TIME COMES,
YOU'RE THE MAN.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.609
( music playing )

00:46.514 --> 00:49.216
IS THAT REALLY HOW MUCH
BONE MARROW THEY HAVE TO TAKE?

00:49.250 --> 00:51.384
ACCORDING TO DR. HAMBURGER.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.119
( laughs )
IT'S HAMBURG.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.487
I KNOW.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.225
SO HERE'S TO YOUR LAST NIGHT
IN BOSTON.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.261
I KNOW THIS TRIP
HASN'T BEEN EASY,

01:00.293 --> 01:02.530
BUT I COULDN'T BE MORE GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.731
I OWE YOU BIG TIME.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.132
HEY, WHAT ARE ILLEGITIMATE
HALF SISTERS FOR?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.468
( chuckles )

01:07.501 --> 01:09.236
CRAZY THAT THIS IS WHAT
HAD TO BRING US TOGETHER.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.237
YEAH.

01:11.272 --> 01:14.542
SORT OF BUMMED
I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO FLORIDA TOMORROW.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.310
REALLY?

01:16.343 --> 01:17.510
GOD YES.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.612
THERE ARE
SO MANY CUTE GUYS HERE.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.450
CASE IN POINT.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.085
HOT BARTENDER AT 3:00.

01:29.222 --> 01:30.790
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING ELSE?

01:30.825 --> 01:33.359
UH, THANKS, BUT WE'RE FINE.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.361
I CAN SEE THAT.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.131
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.799
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU USED THAT LINE?

01:38.832 --> 01:41.234
I CAN'T COUNT THAT HIGH.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.703
AND DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK
FOR YOU

01:42.735 --> 01:44.771
OR ARE YOU JUST HOPING
THAT ONE DAY IT WILL?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.807
OH, SO YOU'RE A MEAN GIRL?

01:46.841 --> 01:48.442
YOU KNOW, I LIKE THAT.

01:48.475 --> 01:50.444
AND I LIKE GUYS
THAT LIKE MEAN GIRLS.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.548
I'M TIRED.
DO YOU WANT TO HEAD OUT SOON?

01:54.581 --> 01:55.883
WHAT?
IT'S SO EARLY.

01:56.115 --> 01:58.519
YEAH, THIS CANCER STUFF
HAS AGED ME IN A SUPER FUN WAY.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.453
I'M USUALLY IN BED BY,
LIKE, 11:00 NOW, SO...

02:00.487 --> 02:02.489
WANT ME TO CALL YOU A CAB
TO GET YOU BACK TO YOUR HOTEL?

02:02.522 --> 02:03.691
MY LAST NIGHT IN THE CITY?

02:03.724 --> 02:06.659
IF I GO BACK TO MY HOTEL
AT ALL,

02:06.694 --> 02:08.429
IT'LL BE WITH HIM.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.532
IF HE CAN PROVE
HE'S WORTH THE EFFORT.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.902
ON THE HOUSE.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.271
I'M CALLING IT "THE MEAN GIRL,"
JUST FOR YOU.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.639
WORTH IT.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.447
NO, THANKS.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.453
OOH!

02:32.485 --> 02:33.387
( chuckles )

02:38.526 --> 02:40.394
( knocking )

02:40.426 --> 02:42.263
WHO IS IT?

02:42.295 --> 02:43.796
- HI.
- HEY.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.332
CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
YOU KNOCKED.

02:46.366 --> 02:50.603
WELL, FELT A LITTLE STRANGE
JUST WALKING IN

02:50.638 --> 02:52.639
AFTER, YOU KNOW.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.641
WHAT, OUR LAST CONVERSATION?

02:54.675 --> 02:57.411
YEAH.
THAT'S PRETTY.

02:57.444 --> 03:01.581
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

03:01.615 --> 03:04.450
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT THAT'S--

03:04.485 --> 03:06.520
HEY, GUYS,
WANT TO WATCH A MOVIE?

03:06.554 --> 03:09.823
WE DOWNLOADED IT
FROM THAT SERIES WE LIKE.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.358
WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN?

03:11.391 --> 03:12.459
"SAW."

03:12.492 --> 03:14.360
WE'RE ABOUT TO START
NUMBER FOUR.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.796
SHE LIKED ALL OF THEM
EXCEPT FOR "SAW III."

03:16.829 --> 03:19.332
YEAH, WELL, PLOT PROBLEMS.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.834
I'LL WATCH,

03:20.867 --> 03:24.371
UNTIL GEORGE STARTS POINTING OUT
THE MEDICAL INACCURACIES

03:24.405 --> 03:25.406
- AS USUAL.
- George: YEAH.

03:25.438 --> 03:26.941
"SHE WOULD NEVER
BLEED OUT THAT FAST."

03:26.973 --> 03:29.509
"HE COULDN'T CONCEIVABLY
CUT OFF HIS OWN LEG."

03:29.543 --> 03:33.413
YEAH, WELL,
YOU WON'T HAVE TO ENDURE
MY RUNNING COMMENTARY TONIGHT,

03:33.447 --> 03:34.548
'CAUSE I CAN'T STAY.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.652
AND ACTUALLY, I--
I HAVE SOME NEWS.

03:39.687 --> 03:43.223
I WANTED TO TELL
YOUR MOM FIRST, BUT...

03:43.257 --> 03:46.225
ALL RIGHT, SO...

03:46.259 --> 03:48.728
I'VE GOT A REALLY EXCITING
JOB OPPORTUNITY

03:48.762 --> 03:50.897
WITH THE WORLD
HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

03:50.930 --> 03:54.901
I'D BE RUNNING THEIR PEDIATRIC
ONCOLOGY OUTREACH UNIT.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.903
- WOW.
- YEAH.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.239
I'M REALLY REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.842
BUT I HAVE TO ASK,
WILL YOU STILL BE ABLE TO TALK
TO DR. HAMBURG ABOUT MY CASE?

04:02.876 --> 04:04.777
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I'M GOING TO KEEP IN TOUCH
WITH SUSAN.

04:04.812 --> 04:08.449
AND AT THE VERY LEAST,
I'LL BE ABLE TO VIDEO CHAT.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.849
VIDEO CHAT?

04:09.883 --> 04:13.387
WELL, MY JOB'S
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.389
WHAT?

04:15.421 --> 04:18.725
YEAH.
THEY NEED ME THERE MONDAY.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.827
SO I HAVE TO LEAVE
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.836

04:28.869 --> 04:32.005

04:57.865 --> 05:00.834
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO TELL EVERYONE
AT ONCE LIKE THAT.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.636
NO, IT'S FINE, I JUST--

05:02.670 --> 05:05.372
I MEAN, I KNOW WE WEREN'T
FEELING EXACTLY OPTIMISTIC

05:05.406 --> 05:07.940
ABOUT US
AFTER OUR LAST CONVERSATION,

05:07.975 --> 05:09.976
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
WE'D REACHED ANY CONCLUSIONS.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.045
I DEFINITELY DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D BE MAKING

05:12.079 --> 05:14.981
- ANY BIG DECISIONS LIKE THIS.
- IT'S NOT LIKE THIS
ISN'T HARD FOR ME.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.418
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO, REALLY.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.786
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.987
YEAH, YOU FEEL LIKE I'M
LETTING MY FEELINGS FOR THOMAS

05:21.021 --> 05:23.456
GET IN THE WAY OF BEING
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.660
IT'S NOT JUST THAT-- IT'S NOT.
IT'S EVERYTHING.

05:26.694 --> 05:30.831
IT'S-- YOU AND I
ARE COMPLICATED.

05:30.863 --> 05:32.598
AND WE ALWAYS WILL BE.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.668
LIFE IS COMPLICATED.
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE JUST LEAVING

05:34.701 --> 05:36.502
- BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID.
- OH, SARA.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.737
YOU'RE TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.840
GOD.

05:39.872 --> 05:42.975
HONESTLY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.778
REALLY? HASN'T LIFE
BEEN HARD ENOUGH ALREADY?

05:47.715 --> 05:51.384
WHAT IF WE JUST REALLY COMMIT
TO TRYING THIS?

05:51.418 --> 05:54.387
ENOUGH HIDING,
ENOUGH SNEAKING AROUND,

05:54.420 --> 05:55.889
ENOUGH DWELLING IN THE PAST.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.692
ARE-- ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT A HYPOTHETICAL HERE?

05:58.725 --> 06:00.961
OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING?

06:00.994 --> 06:03.863
- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.
- I DON'T WANT TO
LOSE YOU EITHER.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.999
BUT IF THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING,

06:06.033 --> 06:10.571
THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
SOON.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.112
SO YOUR UNCLE'S MOVING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

06:19.146 --> 06:21.415
YOUR HALF SISTER
IS ON A PLANE AS WE SPEAK.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.850
TELL ME, WHAT'S YOUR SECRET
TO DRIVING PEOPLE AWAY?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.084
OH, I'M JUST THAT ANNOYING.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.954
THAT WAS MY THEORY.
THANKS FOR CONFIRMING.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.757
YEAH? AND THEN WHAT
DID YOU GET FOR DESSERT?

06:29.790 --> 06:32.725
CARROT CAKE?
YUMMERS!

06:32.759 --> 06:35.394
YOU LOVE CARROTS.
YOU'RE MY LITTLE BUNNY RABBIT.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.863
( laughs )

06:36.896 --> 06:38.899
OOH, YOU'RE BAD.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.034
WAIT, IS YOUR BOSS THERE?
CLOSE THE DOOR.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.103
OH, HOLD ON.
THERE'S PEOPLE HERE.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.408
YES.
YES, THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.043
LIKE THE OTHER PERSON
WHO LIVES HERE.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.711
SO I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU A GUN,

06:51.745 --> 06:54.081
AND IF YOU HEAR ME
TALK LIKE THAT TO A GUY
I'M DATING EVER,

06:54.113 --> 06:55.983
YOU HAVE PERMISSION
TO PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.819
UM, NO GUYS YOU WOULD LIKE
WOULD EVER GO FOR THAT,

06:58.851 --> 07:00.754
EVEN THE ONES IN COMAS.

07:00.788 --> 07:05.024
I LOVE HOW YOU SAY
"GUYS IN COMAS," LIKE, PLURAL.

07:05.057 --> 07:07.661
IT'S NOT EVEN HAPPENING
WITH THE ONE GUY WHO
WAS IN A COMA.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.762
LEO AND I NEVER TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

07:09.797 --> 07:11.031
BETWEEN US
BEFORE HIS SURGERY.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.466
I MEAN, THE HOSPITAL
ISN'T THE MOST ROMANTIC SETTING.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.435
BUT, I MEAN,
HE GETS OUT THIS WEEK, RIGHT?

07:15.468 --> 07:16.836
YEAH, HIS PARENTS
SET HIM UP WITH A PLACE

07:16.870 --> 07:18.204
IN ONE OF THEIR BUILDINGS.

07:18.437 --> 07:22.009
I'M JUST KIND OF NERVOUS TO,
LIKE, BE ALONE WITH HIM AGAIN

07:22.042 --> 07:24.110
IN, LIKE, THE REAL WORLD.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.446
WHAT WOULD ONE
OF THOSE DATING GUIDES SAY?

07:26.480 --> 07:29.216
HMM.
"BOYS WITH BRAIN TUMORS,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.552
THE ULTIMATE MIND GAME."

07:31.584 --> 07:33.653
( laughing )

07:33.687 --> 07:36.656
- OH, WOW. HI.
- HI.

07:36.689 --> 07:40.127
WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY?
DID ORIN TELL YOU CAN START
WEARING JEANS AGAIN?

07:40.159 --> 07:42.629
YOU KNOW HE HATES MY BUTT
IN JEANS.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.197
WHY DOES HE DECIDE
WHAT YOU WEAR?

07:44.230 --> 07:47.668
WELL, I'D RATHER KEEP THE MAN
THAN THE PANTS HE DOESN'T LIKE.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.838
AND IT'S WORKING.
ORIN ASKED ME TO MOVE IN.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.606
- YOU MEAN HE ACTUALLY HAS
HIS OWN PLACE?
- YEAH!

07:53.639 --> 07:57.778
AND IT'S GREAT.
AND HE WANTS ME THERE, LIKE--
LIKE, BY THE WEEKEND.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.247
SO-- SO YOU'RE MOVING
RIGHT AWAY.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.184
HEY, YEAH. I KNOW THIS
IS REALLY HARD FOR YOU,

08:04.218 --> 08:07.920
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU
AND GRAHAM HAVE BEEN DATING
FOR WAY LONGER THAN ORIN AND ME.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.690
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
SOMETIMES IT TAKES GUYS LONGER

08:10.723 --> 08:12.158
TO GET READY FOR THAT NEXT STEP.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.827
WHAT? NO.
NO, THAT'S NOT WHY I'M UPSET.

08:14.862 --> 08:18.165
I'M JUST REALIZING THAT
I HAVE TO FIND A NEW ROOMMATE,
LIKE, NOW.

08:18.197 --> 08:20.567
YOU KNOW I CAN'T AFFORD
THIS PLACE BY MYSELF.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.569
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT SUCKS.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.738
HEY, YOU KNOW, MY COWORKER
IS ABOUT TO GET EVICTED.

08:25.771 --> 08:26.740
SO I'LL GIVE HER YOUR NUMBER.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.774
YAY.
( laughs )

08:30.276 --> 08:32.613
EVICTION!
NOT A GREAT SIGN.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.913
( sighs )
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:33.947 --> 08:36.716
HONESTLY, WHOEVER SHE IS,
IT'LL BE AN UPGRADE.

08:40.153 --> 08:44.524
SO SAY A GUY
ASKS YOU OUT,

08:44.557 --> 08:46.092
AND--
OKAY, HE ASKS ME OUT,

08:46.125 --> 08:50.163
AND HE CLAIMS HE JUST WANTS ME
TO COME OVER TO WATCH TV.

08:50.197 --> 08:54.902
THAT'S, LIKE,
FOR SURE HE JUST WANTS SEX
AND NOT A RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT?

08:54.934 --> 08:56.168
PROBABLY.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.004
OH, GOOD!

08:58.038 --> 09:01.008
- Aaron: CARVER CRUSHED IT.
- I DID?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.677
YOUR CANCER PIECE
GOT THE MOST HITS
OF ANY ARTICLE THIS WEEK.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.711
CONGRATS.
I'M IMPRESSED.

09:05.745 --> 09:06.846
THANKS.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.849
SO WE'RE MAKING SOME CHANGES.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.817
READERS LOVE
THE PERSONAL TOUCH,

09:10.850 --> 09:12.818
AND SO WE'RE DOING AWAY
WITH TWO SECTIONS--

09:12.852 --> 09:14.020
"ARTS" AND "CALENDAR."

09:14.053 --> 09:17.557
INSTEAD MERGING TO ONE--
"LIFESTYLE."

09:17.591 --> 09:19.725
FEWER ARTICLES,
MORE PERSONAL.

09:19.759 --> 09:23.730
OKAY, GREAT,
BECAUSE I HAVE THIS IDEA
FOR THIS REALLY PERSONAL--

09:23.764 --> 09:24.965
YOU ARE PERSONAL ENOUGH.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.267
EVERYBODY ELSE,
DIG DEEPER.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.769
FOLLOW APRIL'S LEAD.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.070
WHAT'S YOUR NICHE?

09:30.102 --> 09:32.338
MINE THAT, WORK TOGETHER.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.042
LIKE TOMORROW NIGHT,
THERE'S A CANCER
BENEFIT CONCERT.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.943
CANCER, CONCERT.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.778
GO.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.913
OH. YOU MEAN--

09:40.947 --> 09:42.982
WAIT WAIT, YOU NEVER
WORKED TOGETHER BEFORE?

09:43.015 --> 09:44.051
IT'LL BE GREAT.

09:50.323 --> 09:54.126
HEY, SO THAT CONCERT--
I'M JUST AS SURPRISED AS YOU.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.995
I KNOW.

09:56.028 --> 09:59.165
SO YOU'LL TAKE THE LEAD.
I MEAN, MUSIC'S YOUR THING
AND IT'S--

09:59.198 --> 10:00.933
- IT'LL BE FINE.
- TOTALLY.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.936
I MEAN,
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE--

10:02.970 --> 10:04.370
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AWKWARD.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.039
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

10:17.049 --> 10:20.921
( Brenna talking,
indistinct )

10:24.057 --> 10:27.693
GUESS WHO'S STAYING
IN BOSTON.

10:27.727 --> 10:31.163
SURPRISE, BITCHES.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.768
( softly chuckles )

10:39.773 --> 10:41.341
I THOUGHT YOUR FLIGHT
WAS THIS MORNING.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.643
YEAH, I MISSED IT.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.345
SHE SPENT THE NIGHT
AT TIEGE'S.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.980
WHO?

10:47.014 --> 10:49.982
TIEGE.
THE HOT BARTENDER
FROM THE CHARLES.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.350
HIS NAME'S TIEGE?

10:51.384 --> 10:52.985
ISN'T THAT SEXY?

10:53.019 --> 10:55.121
SO YOU JUST DECIDED
TO BLOW OFF YOUR FLIGHT

10:55.154 --> 10:56.655
FOR-- FOR TIEGE?

10:56.690 --> 10:58.692
NO, I JUST DIDN'T SET AN ALARM
FOR THIS MORNING.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.227
I FIGURED,
IF I WOKE UP IN TIME, GREAT,

11:01.260 --> 11:03.929
AND IF I DIDN'T,
IT WAS A SIGN I SHOULD STAY
IN BOSTON A LITTLE MORE.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.234
IT WAS A SIGN
THAT YOU DIDN'T NATURALLY
WAKE UP BEFORE 6:00 A.M.?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.101
I DIDN'T THINK THAT HARD
ABOUT IT.

11:09.135 --> 11:12.205
I'M JUST SICK OF FLORIDA.
IT'S BORING.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.307
I'M BETWEEN JOBS,
AND I LOVE MY MOM AND ALL,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.308
BUT I'M SO OVER
LIVING WITH HER.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.010
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

11:18.044 --> 11:20.780
MY PLAN IS TO HANG OUT IN BOSTON
UNTIL I DON'T WANT TO ANYMORE.

11:20.813 --> 11:23.884
TIEGE TOLD ME
I COULD STAY AT HIS PLACE
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.918
OH, AND HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME
SOME SHIFTS AT THE CHARLES

11:25.951 --> 11:27.721
SO I CAN MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH.

11:27.754 --> 11:30.791
A FREE BED, A NEW JOB
AND A HOT GUY?

11:30.823 --> 11:32.225
I'D STAY HERE
FOR TWO OUT OF THREE.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.865
Brenna:
IT'S SO NUTS.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.934
LIKE SIX MONTHS AGO,
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT NATALIE EXISTED,

11:41.967 --> 11:44.837
AND NOW SHE'S LIVING
IN BOSTON.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.340
WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE HER
THAT MUCH.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.210
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE
A PRETTY DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE
THAN US.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.078
YEAH, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

11:52.111 --> 11:55.248
WELL, THEN YOU CAN GO
TO THE TAILGATE PARTIES
WITH NATALIE, MOM,

11:55.282 --> 11:57.149
BECAUSE BRENNA
IS STILL GROUNDED.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.385
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT,

11:59.418 --> 12:01.187
I'M STILL GROUNDED.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.190
THANKS FOR REMINDING ME,
MOM.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.293
MAN, NATALIE'S STAYING,
GEORGE IS LEAVING.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.863
WHEN ARE THINGS IN THIS FAMILY
JUST GOING TO BE NORMAL AGAIN?

12:09.895 --> 12:12.065
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING
FOR UNCLE GEORGE,

12:12.099 --> 12:14.301
LIKE A GOING-AWAY DINNER.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.870
WE TOTALLY SHOULD,
BUT I HAVE TO GET
TO WORK RIGHT NOW.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.772
HERE YOU GO.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.106
- THANK YOU.
- BYE.

12:20.139 --> 12:22.109
BYE.
LOVE YOU GUYS.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.777
- BYE.
- I'M GONNA GO BACK TO BED.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.511
ONE MORE WEEK
UNTIL SCHOOL STARTS.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.514
GOTTA ENJOY MY LAST FEW DAYS
OF SORT-OF FREEDOM.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.051
( chuckles )

12:31.083 --> 12:34.254
GREAT.
JUST WHEN I'M WEIGHING
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH GEORGE,

12:34.287 --> 12:36.456
MY DAUGHTERS TELL ME
THEY WANT THINGS TO GO
BACK TO NORMAL.

12:36.490 --> 12:39.426
WELL, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
LOOK AT THE YEAR THEY'VE HAD--

12:39.459 --> 12:42.394
CANCER, LESBIANISM.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.932
WHAT KIND OF MOM WOULD I BE
IF I DROPPED ANOTHER BOMBSHELL
ON THEM RIGHT NOW?

12:45.966 --> 12:49.168
I MEAN, MAYBE THEY'D
BE OKAY WITH IT THOUGH.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.471
I MEAN, THEY LOVE GEORGE,
THEY'RE SAD TO SEE HIM GO,

12:51.504 --> 12:54.841
THEY WANT ME TO BE HAPPY.
THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO KNOW,
IS THERE?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.376
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:57.409 --> 13:00.447
BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHERE
THE OLD SAYING COMES FROM.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.215
WHAT OLD SAYING?

13:02.249 --> 13:04.518
"WOMEN WHO LIE DOWN
WITH BROTHERS-IN-LAW

13:04.551 --> 13:06.153
WAKE UP ALONE."

13:06.186 --> 13:08.922
THANK YOU, CONFUCIUS.

13:12.926 --> 13:16.263
( knocking at door )

13:16.296 --> 13:18.798
( soft music playing )

13:22.434 --> 13:24.303
OH, HEY THERE.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.505
HEY.
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.475
- ( exhales )
- I ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU

13:28.508 --> 13:30.110
WITHOUT YOUR FLORAL-PRINT GOWN.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.412
OH, YEAH, THAT WAS
SUCH A GOOD LOOK FOR ME.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.114
HERE-- HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.381
THANK YOU.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.116
WOW.

13:37.149 --> 13:41.020
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A SLIGHT UPGRADE

13:41.053 --> 13:44.124
FROM MY LAST PLACE.
BUT I GUESS YOU NEVER
CAME OVER, HUH?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.225
NO, THE ONLY PLACE
WE'VE REALLY HUNG OUT

13:46.259 --> 13:48.495
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL
WAS THE SUPPORT GROUP

13:48.528 --> 13:50.963
AND THE STRIP CLUB.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.067
AND THE FUNERAL HOME.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.537
YES, THE FUNERAL HOME.

13:57.571 --> 14:02.008
SEEMS LIKE WE'VE KIND OF
BEEN DOING THINGS OUT OF ORDER.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.410
TO SAY THE LEAST.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.278
( sighs )

14:06.312 --> 14:10.115
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
CHANGE THAT.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.888
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
ABOUT GOING ON A FIRST DATE

14:14.921 --> 14:17.289
LIKE NORMAL HUMANS DO?

14:17.323 --> 14:20.159
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT IT'LL PROBABLY
HAVE TO BE HERE.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.294
RIGHT,
BECAUSE UNLIKE NORMAL HUMANS,

14:22.328 --> 14:24.096
YOU JUST GOT OUT OF A COMA.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.399
SO IT'S A DATE?

14:26.432 --> 14:28.467
7:30?

14:28.500 --> 14:32.172
TONIGHT?
UM, I HAVE TO WORK.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.941
AH.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.610
NOTHING EXCITING.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.912
TOMORROW?

14:38.945 --> 14:42.081
MY FAMILY IS HAVING
A GOING-AWAY DINNER FOR GEORGE.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.551
- I'M SORRY.
- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
PLAYING HARD-TO-GET.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.586
I GUESS THIS IS
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DATE YOU.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.388
SHUT UP.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.991
I CAN COME OVER AFTER DINNER,
IF YOU DON'T MIND STARTING LATE?

14:53.259 --> 14:56.996
I WAS JUST IN A COMA
FOR MONTHS,

14:57.029 --> 14:59.966
SO I THINK I CAN WAIT
A FEW MORE HOURS.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.130
- HEY.
- OH, HEY, MAN.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.999
HOW'S IT GOING?

15:38.203 --> 15:40.340
( exhales )

15:44.177 --> 15:47.147
APRIL CARVER, HEY.

15:47.179 --> 15:50.216
- HEY, KEV.
- HEY, NICE HAIRCUT.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.085
DID YOU JUST WATCH "LES MIS"
OR SOMETHING?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.253
( laughs )
OR SOMETHING.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.620
HOW'S IT WORKING
AT "THE SENTINEL"?

15:54.653 --> 15:56.389
UGH, CHEAP.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.390
AT LEAST YOU TWO
GET TO WORK WITH SOMEONE
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.059
- KEV.
- UM...

16:00.092 --> 16:02.128
WHAT?
OH, AM I TALKING TOO LOUD?

16:02.162 --> 16:04.197
YOU GUYS STILL
KEEPING YOUR RELATIONSHIP
A SECRET AT WORK?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.365
- KEVIN.
- WHAT?

16:08.168 --> 16:11.203
OH, I--

16:12.706 --> 16:16.576
SORRY.
AHEM.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.614
LET'S SPLIT UP.
YOU KNOW, DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.283
SURE.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.723
BUT I COULDN'T GET CLOSE
TO THE EVENT HOST--

17:04.758 --> 17:07.126
MONICA BRADLEY.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.261
THERE'S A WHOLE LINE
OF REPORTERS TO TALK TO HER.

17:09.295 --> 17:12.198
UM, SHE'S ACTUALLY
GONNA TO MEET US RIGHT
AFTER THE SHOW.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.032
HOW'D YOU MANAGE THAT?

17:14.067 --> 17:15.634
I HAVE CANCER.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.636
NOW SHE TELLS ME.

I'M IN REMISSION,
SO FINGERS CROSSED.

17:45.164 --> 17:48.500
UH, MONICA, THIS IS
MY COLLEAGUE, DOMINIC RUSSO.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.736
- WORK--
- WE'RE--

17:49.769 --> 17:50.836
- SORRY.
- SORRY.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.638
WE'RE COVERING
THIS EVENT TOGETHER.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.807
WOULD YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS?

17:54.840 --> 17:55.808
NOT AT ALL.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.844
AS LONG AS WE CAN SIT.

17:58.076 --> 17:58.811
OH, SURE.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.181
I'M EXHAUSTED.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.682
( sighs )

18:02.714 --> 18:06.385
SO, MONICA, YOU SEEM
TO HAVE PICKED YOUR BANDS
PRETTY CAREFULLY.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.556
I WAS WONDERING,
HOW DID YOU CHOOSE WHO
YOU WANTED TO PLAY TONIGHT?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.857
WELL, I PICK BANDS THAT PLAY

18:12.090 --> 18:15.728
WHAT I LIKE TO THINK
IS MUSIC TO FALL IN LOVE TO.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.163
I'M ALWAYS TRYING
TO PUT CANCER SURVIVORS
TOGETHER

18:18.198 --> 18:20.333
IN ROMANTIC SETTINGS--

18:20.365 --> 18:22.501
SORT OF A MATCHMAKING HOBBY
OF MINE.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.237
WHY IS THAT?

18:24.269 --> 18:27.373
WELL, THEY SAY BEING IN LOVE
CAN HELP YOUR CHANCES
AT REMISSION.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.143
IT'S HARD TO START
A RELATIONSHIP

18:30.175 --> 18:32.345
OR KEEP ONE GOING
AFTER CANCER.

18:32.377 --> 18:36.115
OFTEN IT'S EASIER
TO DATE ANOTHER SURVIVOR.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.484
HAVE YOU FOUND THAT
TO BE TRUE?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.252
I-- WELL, I--

18:40.286 --> 18:43.856
YEAH. SHE'S DATING
A CANCER SURVIVOR.

18:43.890 --> 18:47.359
UH, LEO AND I HAVEN'T
EVEN BEEN ON OUR FIRST DATE YET.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.262
GUESS YOU GUYS
DIDN'T EVEN NEED A FIRST DATE.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.267
SO HE KNOWS
ABOUT YOUR ILLNESS?

18:54.299 --> 18:57.737
YEAH, HE FOUND OUT
PRETTY EARLY ON.

18:57.769 --> 19:01.673
YEAH, THE PERSON YOU'RE DATING
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT YOUR CANCER.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.809
DOMINIC.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.248
UH, WE WERE IN
THE SAME CANCER SUPPORT GROUP.

19:10.148 --> 19:13.786
WELL, ALL RELATIONSHIPS
ARE TOUGH.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.288
THAT'S WHY I LOVE THIS EVENT.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.724
BECAUSE MUSIC
CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER,

19:18.758 --> 19:21.894
COUNTERACTING THE CANCER,

19:21.928 --> 19:24.564
WHICH CAN DRIVE THEM APART.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.474
( soft music playing )

19:35.508 --> 19:38.577
HI,
I'M PICKING UP AN ORDER--

19:38.611 --> 19:40.779
APRIL!

19:40.813 --> 19:42.648
WOW, HEY.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.349
YOU REALLY ARE WORKING HERE.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.486
YEP.
I'M A TRAINEE.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.489
APPARENTLY IT TAKES
A LOT OF TRAINING TO LEARN
HOW TO POUR THINGS INTO CUPS.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.890
( laughs )

19:50.923 --> 19:52.458
YOU WANT A BEER FOR THE ROAD?

19:52.491 --> 19:54.861
I COULD USE A LITTLE PRACTICE
POURING INTO THE TO-GO CUPS.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.730
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.501
HEY.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.673
WHAT'S WRONG?
I THOUGHT YOU--
I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTO HIM.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.442
I WAS UNTIL I STARTING
STAYING WITH HIM.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.412
YOU KNOW HOW
ONCE YOU HAVE SEX WITH A GUY,

20:12.444 --> 20:14.380
YOU KIND OF FEEL OBLIGATED
TO KEEP SLEEPING WITH HIM?

20:14.413 --> 20:16.481
NOT REALLY.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.317
YOU KNOW, HE'S LETTING ME
STAY THERE FOR FREE.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.421
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN BE ALL,
"NO, I DON'T FEEL LIKE
HAVING SEX TONIGHT."

20:21.453 --> 20:23.455
YES, YOU CAN.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.291
NATALIE,
IF HE'S MAKING YOU DO THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO,

20:26.326 --> 20:27.759
- THAT'S NOT OKAY.
- OH, STOP.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.962
I'M FINE.
LOOK AT THE GUY.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.432
IT'S NOT BAD TO HAVE SEX
WITH HIM OR ANYTHING.

20:32.464 --> 20:36.536
HE'S JUST CLINGY
AND SOMETIMES I NEED MY SPACE.
YOU KNOW?

20:38.337 --> 20:40.873
YOU WANT ME TO ASK MY MOM
IF YOU CAN STAY WITH US?

20:40.906 --> 20:43.476
NO.
MY MOM WOULD FREAK.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.911
NO OFFENSE.

20:44.943 --> 20:46.778
I'VE GOT SOME MONEY SAVED UP.
I JUST NEED TO START LOOKING.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.413
I'M NOT DESPERATE
OR ANYTHING.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.450
OKAY.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.451
GOOD NIGHT.

20:52.484 --> 20:54.519
GOOD NIGHT.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.457
( Tiege whispering )

21:10.435 --> 21:13.806
HI.
HI, ARE YOU BETH?

21:13.839 --> 21:15.642
HI, JESSICA.
I'M MORGAN'S FRIEND.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.509
HI.
YOU'RE EARLY.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.545
YES, I KNOW.
I'M ALWAYS EARLY.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.413
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET
ON MY LUNCH BREAK,

21:21.446 --> 21:24.416
AND I'M JUST LEAVING
FOR WORK, LIKE, RIGHT NOW.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.317
UH-HUH.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.353
( both giggling )

21:27.386 --> 21:29.388
HEY, CAN YOU STOP RUNNING?

21:29.422 --> 21:30.556
YEAH, SORRY.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.526
SO I'M REALLY GLAD
I CAUGHT YOU.

21:33.558 --> 21:37.029
MY DAY JUST GOT CRAZY.
IS THIS AREA SAFE?

21:37.063 --> 21:38.698
LOOKS KIND OF SKETCHY
TO ME.

21:38.730 --> 21:41.034
BUT THAT'S OKAY--
I TAKE SELF DEFENSE.
CAN WE GO INSIDE?

21:41.067 --> 21:43.368
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF LATE
FOR WORK.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.605
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
BEFORE ZUMBA ANYWAY.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.008
- RIGHT.
- SO ARE YOU NEAT?

21:49.041 --> 21:50.676
'CAUSE YOU KNOW, THERE'S NEAT
AND THEN THERE'S CLEAN.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.377
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE
THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY

21:52.412 --> 21:54.012
A HUGE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE TWO.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.748
OOH, AND WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT FOOD.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.316
I'LL EMAIL YOU A LIST
OF MY ALLERGIES.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.355
I GUESS I'D HAVE TIME
TO MAKE SALMON

22:02.387 --> 22:04.990
IF I MARINATE IT THIS AFTERNOON
BETWEEN PATIENTS.

22:05.023 --> 22:07.960
MOM, WHEN I SAID
THAT WE SHOULD DO A DINNER
FOR UNCLE GEORGE,

22:07.993 --> 22:10.395
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
YOU SHOULD HAVE TO COOK
THIS WHOLE BIG THING.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.398
NO, HONEY, THAT'S OKAY.
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR HIM.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.401
WELL, AT LEAST LET ME
HELP YOU COOK SOMETHING.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.869
- I FEEL LIKE I OWE YOU.
- FOR WHAT?

22:17.903 --> 22:21.574
UM, ALMOST BEING
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL,

22:21.606 --> 22:24.911
GETTING DRUNK
WITH NATALIE,
BREAKING INTO GREER'S.

22:24.943 --> 22:28.681
OKAY, JUST CHECKING
TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALL
THINGS I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.950
HOW ARE THINGS WITH GREER?

22:30.982 --> 22:34.052
WE HAVEN'T TALKED SINCE
THAT NIGHT WITH HER PARENTS.

22:34.086 --> 22:38.958
I WAS KIND OF ASSUMING
THAT SHE WOULD TRY
AND REACH OUT TO ME,

22:38.990 --> 22:41.426
BUT WHATEVER.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.930
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT SEEING HER
NEXT WEEK AT SCHOOL?

22:43.962 --> 22:46.132
I'M DREADING IT.

22:46.365 --> 22:51.002
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO GET OVER YOUR EX
WHEN YOU SEE THEM EVERY DAY?

22:51.037 --> 22:53.138
HONEY, I KNOW IT FEELS
IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT NOW,

22:53.372 --> 22:55.641
BUT YOU WILL MOVE ON.
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.744
WHEN DADDY DIED,
I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS IT.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.713
BUT NOW I'M FEELING
LIKE I MIGHT BE READY

23:01.748 --> 23:04.116
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.986
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

23:07.019 --> 23:12.157
I MEAN, I KNOW
THAT THERE WERE SOME ISSUES
WITH ME DATING LAST SPRING,

23:12.391 --> 23:14.160
BUT...

23:14.393 --> 23:16.596
IF IT WAS THE RIGHT GUY.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.065
YEAH? HOW WOULD YOU
DEFINE THE RIGHT GUY?

23:19.097 --> 23:21.433
LOOK, MOM,
IT'S QUINCY'S KITCHEN.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.469
ISN'T THAT WHERE WE TOOK YOU
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

23:23.502 --> 23:26.038
OH, YEAH.
THAT WAS GOOD.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.508
YEAH, I STOP IN THERE
SOMETIMES ON MY OWN

23:28.540 --> 23:30.675
WHEN I'M ON THAT SIDE OF TOWN.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.546
I GUESS HE'S CATERING NOW.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.115
WHAT IF WE
HAD HIM TO GEORGE'S DINNER?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.017
THAT WAY WE'RE DOING
SOMETHING SPECIAL,

23:38.049 --> 23:39.751
BUT WE DON'T
HAVE TO STRESS ABOUT IT.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.020
OH, THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

23:42.054 --> 23:46.526
GOOD.
I MEAN, IT'S UNCLE GEORGE.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.996
IT SHOULD NOT BE STRESSFUL.

23:54.032 --> 23:56.067
SHOULD WE JUST
PUT OUR QUOTES TOGETHER

23:56.102 --> 23:58.171
AND PICK THE CATCHIEST ONE
FOR THE HEADLINE?

23:58.203 --> 24:00.972
- YEAH, SURE.
- ( phone ringing )

24:04.210 --> 24:06.645
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

24:06.679 --> 24:08.847
YOU LIKE THREESOMES?

24:08.881 --> 24:10.650
WHAT?

24:10.682 --> 24:13.118
WELL, MY PARENTS
HIRED A NURSE FOR ME.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.953
HIS NAME IS PETE.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.454
FULL-TIME?

24:16.489 --> 24:17.789
Practically.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.991
HE'S LIKE MY NEW LIFE COMPANION.

24:20.026 --> 24:23.195
PETE AND I WATCHED
THE MORNING NEWS TOGETHER.

24:23.229 --> 24:27.500
AND LET'S JUST SAY MY DREAMS
OF WALKING AROUND NAKED,

24:27.532 --> 24:29.067
WELL, THEY'VE BEEN SQUASHED.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.103
UNLESS YOU ASK NICELY,
PETE.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.539
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WEAR
AS LONG AS YOU STICK
TO YOUR SCHEDULE.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.608
OH, RIGHT, MY SCHEDULE.

24:36.642 --> 24:40.212
MY SCHEDULE WHICH LEAVES ME
ZERO TIME TO MYSELF.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.015
UM, IT'S OKAY-- I'LL JUST--
I'LL COME OVER AND WE'LL
FIGURE IT OUT.

24:47.252 --> 24:50.222
DID YOU FIND ANY GOOD QUOTES?

24:50.256 --> 24:53.125
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I--
I REMEMBER ONE FROM YOU

24:53.159 --> 24:56.596
WHEN YOU SAID,
"I TOLD THE OTHER GUY
I WAS SICK RIGHT AWAY."

24:56.628 --> 24:59.131
THAT WAS VERY,
VERY ENLIGHTENING.

24:59.164 --> 25:03.134
DOMINIC, LEO KNEW
BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT GROUP.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.070
IT WASN'T LIKE A DECISION
TO TELL HIM.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.972
I KNOW.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.009
IT'S JUST...

25:10.041 --> 25:13.246
( sighs )
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

25:13.278 --> 25:16.115
NO, HEY, COME ON.

25:17.782 --> 25:20.252
I GET THAT
YOU ARE STILL MAD AT ME.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.955
BUT I REALLY THOUGHT
WE WERE MOVING PAST THIS.

25:23.990 --> 25:28.193
FOUR MONTHS AGO, LAST NIGHT--
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH FUN.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.296
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
LIKE THE PERFECT DATE.

25:30.528 --> 25:34.133
AND NOW IT'S-- IT'S HARD
TO EVEN BE AROUND YOU.

25:36.001 --> 25:39.204
AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S HARD
FOR YOU AT ALL.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.912
YOU TWO, MY OFFICE NOW.

25:54.686 --> 25:55.988
I JUST HAD THE PLEASURE
OF TALKING TO THE HOST

25:56.021 --> 25:56.955
OF THE CANCER BENEFIT,
MONICA SOMETHING-- NICE LADY--

25:56.989 --> 25:59.025
AND SHE ASKED ME
ABOUT YOU TWO,

25:59.057 --> 26:01.294
AS IF THERE WERE A YOU TWO.
"TENSION," SHE SAID.

26:01.326 --> 26:02.862
THERE WAS DEFINITELY TENSION.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.696
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.164
WHAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN?

26:06.198 --> 26:08.134
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU TWO DATING?

26:08.166 --> 26:10.936
- WE USED TO.
- BUT IT'S OVER NOW, TOTALLY?

26:10.970 --> 26:13.705
'CAUSE IT CLEARLY
WASN'T OVER LAST NIGHT
OR THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.209
AND BY THE WAY,
I DON'T LIKE HOW LONG
IT'S TAKING YOU TO ANSWER THIS.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.845
SO IS IT OVER, YES OR NO?

26:22.981 --> 26:24.717
YES.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.053
BACK TO WORK.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.924
- HEY.
- I'LL TAKE FIRST PASS
AT THE ARTICLE.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.693
IF YOU HAVE ANY EDITS,
JUST EMAIL THEM TO ME.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.628
DOMINIC, WAIT.

26:39.731 --> 26:42.167
- I--
- YOU WHAT?

26:44.903 --> 26:46.905
I'LL SEND YOU THE EDITS
RIGHT AWAY.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.677
April:
BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY

26:52.711 --> 26:55.013
IS THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BE AROUND HIM TOO.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.883
BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR
TO DOMINIC OR LEO.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.720
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TELL LEO, ARE YOU?

27:00.752 --> 27:02.989
'CAUSE, I MEAN,
HE REALLY DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.191
I KNOW, BUT I JUST,
FROM NOW ON,

27:05.223 --> 27:07.826
WANT TO BE THE KIND OF PERSON
THAT TELLS THE TRUTH WHEN
THEY'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP,

27:07.859 --> 27:09.228
EVEN WHEN IT'S PAINFUL.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.262
OH, YOU WON'T START DOING THAT
WITH ME, THOUGH, WILL YOU?

27:11.297 --> 27:13.132
OH, NO, I'LL KEEP TELLING YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.767
OH, THANK GOD.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.836
I'LL BE GETTING ENOUGH HONESTY
FROM MY NEW ROOMMATE.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.703
OH, YOU MET HER?
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

27:18.738 --> 27:20.839
SHE WORKS OUT COMPULSIVELY,

27:20.873 --> 27:22.842
SHE HATES TELEVISION,

27:22.875 --> 27:24.777
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
SHE'S ON SOMETHING,

27:24.809 --> 27:26.711
AND SHE ALREADY EMAILED ME
A CHORE CALENDAR.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.347
BUT, I DON'T KNOW,
I'M DESPERATE, SO...

27:29.382 --> 27:31.983
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY TOLD HER
SHE'S GOT THE APARTMENT YET?

27:32.018 --> 27:33.885
NO, I'M GOING
TO CALL HER TONIGHT.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.186
HOLD OFF ON THAT.

27:35.221 --> 27:38.023
I WANT YOU
TO MEET SOMEONE FIRST.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.924
George:
THIS IS SUCH AN INDULGENCE,

27:39.959 --> 27:41.861
HAVING MY FAREWELL DINNER
PREPARED

27:41.894 --> 27:43.962
BY A PROFESSIONAL CHEF.
( laughs )

27:43.996 --> 27:47.799
UH, A PROFESSIONAL CHEF
WHO REALIZES

27:47.833 --> 27:49.801
THAT HE UNPROFESSIONALLY,
EMBARRASSINGLY

27:49.835 --> 27:51.836
FORGOT HIS SOUFFLE DISH.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.140
OH.
OH, WAIT A SECOND.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.008
I THINK WE MIGHT
HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.843
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

27:57.876 --> 28:00.346
YOUR FATHER INSISTED
THAT WE REGISTER FOR ONE

28:00.378 --> 28:03.249
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
AND THEN NEVER USED IT.

28:03.281 --> 28:05.084
PERFECT.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.886
SO YOU TWO,
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED?

28:09.922 --> 28:14.759
NO, GEORGE IS--
WAS MY-- MY HUSBAND-- MY--

28:14.794 --> 28:16.061
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.762
- YES.
- OH.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.432
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

28:20.965 --> 28:23.969
I'VE ALWAYS NOTICED YOU
IN MY RESTAURANT.

28:24.002 --> 28:27.807
YOU STAND OUT--
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN DINING ALONE.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.278
UH, WE COULD
START THE SALAD COURSE

28:32.310 --> 28:34.779
IF YOU'D ALL LIKE
TO TAKE YOUR SEATS.

28:35.948 --> 28:38.483
UH, QUINCY IS TOTALLY
FLIRTING WITH YOU.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.051
OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.987
MM-HMM.
BRENNA'S RIGHT.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.289
HE'S CUTE.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.857
AND HE COOKS.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.893
YEAH, BUT HE FORGOT
HIS SOUFFLE DISH.

28:47.926 --> 28:50.328
SOUNDS IRRESPONSIBLE.
PROBABLY USES DRUGS.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.498
COME ON, UNCLE GEORGE,
BACK US UP HERE.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.901
YEAH, I GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
I CAN SAY.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.736
( clinking )

28:57.769 --> 29:00.239
DON'T PANIC.
IT'S GONNA BE QUICK.

29:00.271 --> 29:02.474
OKAY, SO, UH...

29:02.508 --> 29:04.777
WELL, TO PUT IT MILDLY,

29:04.809 --> 29:06.878
I'M GOING
TO MISS THIS FAMILY.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.914
YOU'VE OF COURSE ALWAYS BEEN
VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART,

29:09.949 --> 29:12.951
BUT NEVER AS CLOSE
AS IN THESE LAST FEW MONTHS.

29:12.984 --> 29:16.087
AND WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.191
AND THE DISTANCE
WILL BE DIFFICULT,

29:19.224 --> 29:23.929
BUT I DON'T THINK
THE DISTANCE WILL BE ENOUGH
TO BREAK US APART.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.803
I MISS YOU ALREADY.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.077
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CREAM

29:39.111 --> 29:41.279
AND SUGAR,

29:41.313 --> 29:44.782
THREE TO FIVE MINUTES.
IT'S SO EASY.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.385
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE
BUYS WHIPPED CREAM AT A STORE.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.954
OH, NO! GUILTY.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.525
- ( both laughing )
- SORRY.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.493
THEY'RE PRETTY CUTE TOGETHER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

29:55.528 --> 29:57.429
YEAH.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.165
IT'S SWEET HOW YOU
LOOK AFTER YOUR MOM LIKE THAT.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.934
WELL, SHE CAN BE
PRETTY CLUELESS
SOMETIMES.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.237
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL KEEP LOOKING AFTER HER

30:05.270 --> 30:06.805
WHEN I LEAVE, HUH?

30:06.838 --> 30:08.507
I PROMISE.

30:18.416 --> 30:21.854
OKAY, JUST LET THIS SIT.
HERE, TRY IT.

30:21.886 --> 30:22.922
OKAY.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.825
- SO GOOD.
- IT'S GOOD, HUH?

30:28.059 --> 30:29.394
( knocking at door )

30:31.829 --> 30:33.898
HI.

30:35.401 --> 30:39.337
WHOA!
SWEET PLACE.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.339
THANKS.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.210
APRIL TOLD ME
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT BARTENDER GUY.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.345
SO, YOU KNOW,
JUST TO BE CLEAR,

30:46.377 --> 30:47.947
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SLEEP WITH ME TO STAY HERE.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.882
WELL, THEN NEVER MIND.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.482
( laughs )

30:51.517 --> 30:54.019
YOUR ROOM'S THAT WAY,
KITCHEN'S THERE.

30:54.052 --> 30:55.854
WE CAN SPLIT UTILITIES
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

30:55.887 --> 30:57.423
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN JUST PAY MONTH TO MONTH

30:57.455 --> 31:00.125
- UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT
YOUR LIVING SITUATION.
- COOL.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.528
I CAN'T PLAN MORE
THAN A MONTH AHEAD ANYWAY.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.329
( laughs )
PERFECT.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.931
OKAY, SO I GOTTA GO FINISH
GETTING READY.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.132
I'M GOING OUT IN A BIT.

31:07.165 --> 31:09.134
I LOVE GOING OUT.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.537
LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.105
YEAH, I HAD A FEELING.

31:13.137 --> 31:14.440
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ANYWAY?

31:14.472 --> 31:16.342
OH, I HAVE TO STOP BY
MY BOSS'S PLACE

31:16.375 --> 31:18.477
AND THEN I'M MEETING UP
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.412
YOU GUYS GOING SOMEWHERE FUN?

31:20.445 --> 31:23.315
WE'RE JUST
GOING TO THE CHARLES.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.084
WELL, YOU MAY SEE ME THERE.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.553
GOTTA HAVE A TALK
WITH BARTENDER DUDE.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.154
GOTTA TELL HIM
THAT I'M NOT JUST MOVING OUT,

31:30.189 --> 31:31.557
I'M MOVING ON.

31:31.589 --> 31:33.625
BUT THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?

31:33.659 --> 31:35.426
YEAH, WHY?

31:35.461 --> 31:38.263
LET'S JUST SAY
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
GOING TO BE MAKING IT EASY

31:38.297 --> 31:39.498
FOR HIM TO MOVE ON.

31:41.299 --> 31:44.336
( laughs )
OKAY.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.142
- HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.
- NO WAY.

31:50.174 --> 31:51.576
- COME ON.
- YOU ARE THE GUEST OF HONOR.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.511
- ALL RIGHT.
- YOU CAN KEEP ME
COMPANY THOUGH.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.381
YEAH, WILL DO, WILL DO.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.282
OH, YOU KNOW,
I READ THAT ARTICLE

31:57.316 --> 31:59.684
YOU DID IN THE PAPER
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
IT WAS REALLY GREAT.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.420
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

32:01.452 --> 32:04.123
DID YOU CRY?
MY BOSS KEEPS TELLING ME
I NEED TO MAKE MY READERS CRY

32:04.155 --> 32:05.423
SO HE CAN SELL
MORE NEWSPAPERS.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.126
( laughs )

32:08.160 --> 32:10.528
IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD
NOT HAVING YOU AROUND.

32:10.561 --> 32:14.098
WELL, YOU'LL BE IN GREAT HANDS
WITH DR. HAMBURG.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.335
NO, I DON'T-- I DON'T MEAN
ABOUT THE MEDICAL STUFF.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.470
I MEAN AROUND HERE

32:18.503 --> 32:20.372
AND OUR FAMILY.

32:20.405 --> 32:23.075
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
WE KNOW YOU BETTER NOW

32:23.107 --> 32:24.410
THAN WE EVER HAVE,

32:24.442 --> 32:26.612
EVEN WHEN MY DAD
WAS ALIVE.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.513
I'M JUST REALLY GLAD
WE GOT THE CHANCE

32:28.547 --> 32:30.348
BEFORE YOU FOUND THIS JOB.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.451
DEFINITELY.

32:32.483 --> 32:35.487
BUT...

32:35.520 --> 32:39.223
YOU MUST BE EXCITED.
I MEAN, NEW JOB, NEW CITY.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.491
BUT I LOVE BOSTON.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.961
I MEAN, I HAVE SO MANY
GREAT MEMORIES HERE.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.631
WE'LL SEE.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY NEW
LIFE IS GOING TO BE LIKE.

32:45.663 --> 32:47.633
SO MANY GREAT THINGS
THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME

32:47.665 --> 32:49.634
HAVE COME
AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE.

32:51.135 --> 32:54.105
I'M GONNA GO SAY GOODBYE
TO EVERYBODY.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.278
MOM, YOU ALL RIGHT?

32:59.310 --> 33:01.212
YEAH.

33:01.246 --> 33:04.249
I'M FINE.
TRANSITIONS ARE ALWAYS HARD.

33:04.282 --> 33:08.420
YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT
A LOT TOO LATELY.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.622
I HAD TO START WORKING
WITH DOMINIC AGAIN.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.157
DO YOU MISS HIM?

33:13.192 --> 33:16.494
SOMETIMES.

33:18.364 --> 33:23.167
BUT NOW IT'S LIKE
THERE'S SO MUCH BAGGAGE.

33:23.201 --> 33:25.770
BEING AROUND HIM
IS JUST TOO COMPLICATED.

33:26.003 --> 33:27.705
I GUESS IT ALWAYS WILL BE.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.642
OR MAYBE YOU'RE
JUST TELLING YOURSELF THAT

33:30.675 --> 33:33.144
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER
THAN TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.748
I THINK ABOUT THAT TOO.

33:35.780 --> 33:39.518
IT'S-- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS.

33:39.550 --> 33:42.354
I GUESS YOU HAVE TO
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS

33:42.387 --> 33:45.190
AND JUST DO THE BEST
YOU CAN.

33:45.223 --> 33:47.192
( footsteps approach )

33:47.226 --> 33:49.394
AND THAT BECOMES
THE RIGHT ANSWER.

33:52.029 --> 33:53.664
WALK ME OUT?

33:53.699 --> 33:55.233
YEAH.

33:58.436 --> 34:01.240
SO...

34:01.272 --> 34:03.342
QUINCY THOUGHT
WE WERE MARRIED, HUH?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.544
SORRY.

34:05.576 --> 34:08.547
NOT EXACTLY THE BEST WAY
TO SEND YOU OFF.

34:08.579 --> 34:12.317
WELL, SO,
YOU'RE SENDING ME OFF, HUH?

34:12.351 --> 34:14.219
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

34:14.253 --> 34:16.487
ABOUT US BOTH DESERVING
TO HAVE OUR LIVES

34:16.521 --> 34:19.324
JUST BE A LITTLE EASIER,
A LITTLE LESS BURDENED,

34:19.358 --> 34:21.460
AND IT REALLY HIT HOME
WITH ME TONIGHT.

34:21.492 --> 34:24.530
AND NOT BECAUSE I HAVE FEELINGS
FOR THE CHEF OR ANYTHING,

34:24.563 --> 34:28.400
BUT I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK,
WHAT IF I DID?

34:28.434 --> 34:30.268
IT WOULDN'T BE HARD
TO TELL THE GIRLS.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.338
THERE WOULDN'T BE
SOME COMPLICATED HISTORY

34:33.371 --> 34:36.775
THAT EXISTS BETWEEN US
THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PAST.

34:36.809 --> 34:39.411
NO, I GET IT, I GET IT.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.213
I DO.
YOU DESERVE THAT.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.782
YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.

34:43.815 --> 34:47.286
WE BOTH DO.

35:06.237 --> 35:07.706
HEY, UNCLE GEORGE?

35:08.706 --> 35:11.342
HEY.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.311
I LOVE YOU.

35:13.344 --> 35:15.313
LOVE YOU TOO.

35:35.367 --> 35:38.436
SO HOW DID YOU GET STALIN

35:38.469 --> 35:40.505
TO LET ME OUT OF THE GULAG?

35:40.539 --> 35:42.474
IT WAS EASIER THAN YOU THINK.

35:42.507 --> 35:46.344
LET'S JUST SAY
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER
OF "NURSE JACKIE" ON DVD.

35:46.378 --> 35:50.248
AND I PROMISED I'D STICK
TO YOUR SCHEDULE.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.451
WHAT IS ON THE SCHEDULE
FOR TONIGHT?

35:52.483 --> 35:54.585
BATH AT 9:00.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.155
OH, AND LOOK AT THE TIME.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.525
AND LOOK AT THIS GIANT BATHTUB
IN FRONT OF US.

35:59.557 --> 36:02.628
THAT POOL IS REALLY COLD.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.695
NOT WHEN YOU HEAT IT UP
TO 95°.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.501
OH.

36:09.534 --> 36:12.471
DO YOU WEAR YOUR UNDERWEAR
IN THE BATH?

36:12.503 --> 36:14.873
BECAUSE I'M JUST SAYING,
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE
AUTHENTIC HERE, I'D--

36:14.907 --> 36:16.942
- DON'T PUSH IT.
- OKAY.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.710
AH!

36:18.744 --> 36:20.878
- OH.
- ( gasps )

36:20.913 --> 36:22.246
( laughs )

36:24.349 --> 36:26.918
- OH, GOD.
- NEED HELP?

36:26.952 --> 36:29.487
NOPE, NO.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.423
- OH.
- ( laughs )

36:32.456 --> 36:33.659
( moaning )

36:33.692 --> 36:35.494
DON'T WORRY.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.530
I'LL BE THERE IN TWO SHAKES
OF A-- OH!

36:42.300 --> 36:43.902
AAH!

36:46.371 --> 36:47.371
AAH!

36:48.373 --> 36:51.643
- ( Leo grunting )
- ( laughing )

36:51.677 --> 36:53.545
HEY, HEY.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.246
YEAH?

36:55.280 --> 36:57.548
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.251
PETE IS GOING TO JOIN US
FOR THE BUBBLE BATH?

37:00.284 --> 37:02.253
( laughs )
I WISH.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.989
NO, UM,

37:05.222 --> 37:08.226
THAT WORK ASSIGNMENT
I HAD LAST NIGHT
WAS WITH DOMINIC.

37:08.260 --> 37:11.228
OH.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.864
OKAY.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.865
I-- I MEAN,
NOTHING HAPPENED OR ANYTHING.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.570
I JUST, I WANTED TO TELL YOU
SO IT'S ALL OUT IN THE OPEN.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.938
REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID
THE THING ABOUT DYING

37:20.972 --> 37:23.275
IS THAT THERE'S NO TIME
FOR ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

37:23.307 --> 37:24.842
I SAID THAT, HUH?

37:24.876 --> 37:27.311
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.481
YOU'RE KIND OF FULL OF THOSE.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.282
ANYWAY, WE MIGHT
NOT BE DYING AT THE MOMENT,

37:31.315 --> 37:33.018
BUT I STILL WANT
TO LIVE LIKE THAT.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.288
WHAT'S IT LIKE NOW
WITH YOU AND DOMINIC?

37:36.320 --> 37:38.623
IF WE'RE BEING HONEST,
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

37:38.657 --> 37:41.525
HONESTLY, IT'S HARD.

37:41.559 --> 37:45.731
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH EASIER IT'D BE

37:45.764 --> 37:47.965
IF YOU WERE WITH A GUY

37:48.000 --> 37:50.335
WHO DIDN'T HAVE BRAIN CANCER?

37:50.369 --> 37:53.905
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT.

37:53.938 --> 37:58.710
BUT I'D STILL
RATHER BE HERE WITH YOU.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.849
IS THAT A WEIRD THING
FOR ME TO ADMIT?

38:04.882 --> 38:06.418
SORT OF.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.786
( laughs )

38:07.818 --> 38:09.920
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
LET GO OF THE IDEA

38:09.954 --> 38:11.989
THAT THIS
WILL EVER BE NORMAL--

38:12.023 --> 38:14.025
WHAT YOU AND I HAVE.

38:14.059 --> 38:17.528
THAT'S KIND OF
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT.

GET HIT ON ALL NIGHT.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.630
HOW ARE YOU STILL SO BITTER
WHEN YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

39:58.663 --> 40:01.166
JUST SIT, HAVE A DRINK.
CHILL OUT.

40:01.398 --> 40:03.969
YEAH, HAVE A DRINK.
CHILL OUT.

40:04.001 --> 40:08.106
WELL, I WOULD
IF I COULD FIND THE BARTENDER.

40:08.139 --> 40:11.476
I THINK HE WENT OUT
FOR A SMOKE.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.911
I'LL GET YOU.

40:12.943 --> 40:14.679
YOU NEW HERE?

40:14.713 --> 40:18.817
I'M SO NEW
I DON'T OFFICIALLY EXIST.

40:18.849 --> 40:21.820
NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN TERMS OF SPECIALTY VODKAS?

40:21.853 --> 40:24.088
YOU HAVE ANYTHING
FROM NORTHERN LITHUANIA, MAYBE?

40:24.121 --> 40:26.157
YOU LOOK SO FAMILIAR.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.858
IS THAT A GOOD THING?

40:27.893 --> 40:29.894
I DON'T KNOW.
IT DEPENDS.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.030
DID I DO SOMETHING BAD
TO YOU?

40:34.599 --> 40:35.733
NOT YET.

40:35.766 --> 40:39.036
OR ANY-- ANY VODKA
WOULD BE GREAT.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.775
ON THE HOUSE.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.577
HEY, YOU SEE THAT GUY
OVER THERE?

40:46.610 --> 40:50.148
THE BARTENDER THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE SERVING YOU?

40:50.181 --> 40:52.983
I'M TRYING TO GET HIM
OFF MY BACK.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.085
I TOLD HIM I HAVE A BOYFRIEND
DOWN IN FLORIDA,

40:55.119 --> 40:56.755
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE BELIEVES ME.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.789
WHY WOULDN'T HE BELIEVE THAT?

40:58.824 --> 41:01.927
BECAUSE I'M LYING.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.695
YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT?

41:03.728 --> 41:05.864
PRETEND TO BE
MY FLORIDA BOYFRIEND
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

41:05.896 --> 41:08.934
HOW DO YOU DO THIS?

41:08.967 --> 41:12.536
AS A FAVOR TO THE NEW GIRL.

41:15.606 --> 41:16.740
IS HE LOOKING NOW?

41:19.476 --> 41:20.744
MM-HMM.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.920
I'M LOOKING NOW.
HELLO.

41:28.954 --> 41:32.724
UH, OKAY.
I'LL JUST--

41:32.757 --> 41:34.592
( chuckles )

41:36.827 --> 41:38.829
THERE HE GOES.

41:38.864 --> 41:41.666
HE'S NOT HAPPY.

41:41.699 --> 41:43.235
POOR GUY.

41:43.268 --> 41:47.639
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
WHOEVER SHE IS,

41:47.672 --> 41:48.907
IS ONE LUCKY WOMAN.

41:48.940 --> 41:53.244
I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
ANYMORE.

41:53.277 --> 41:56.914
THEN I GUESS
I'M THE LUCKY ONE.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.184
OKAY.

42:01.820 --> 42:02.853
HEY.
