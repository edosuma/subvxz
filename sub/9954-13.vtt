opened an otherworldly door.

—Hands up.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.752
I want to know who you are
and how you got here.

00:12.889 --> 00:14.095
William's giving out troubles

00:14.223 --> 00:16.965
because he thinks
the original Audrey liked it.

00:17.101 --> 00:20.138
You were always
such a clever troublemaker.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.852
This is about us.

00:21.981 --> 00:22.811
You felt her.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.556
You felt your original self,
and you liked it.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.435
I want you back.
I love you.

00:28.571 --> 00:29.686
No one's taking Audrey away.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.437
Who does William think that I am?

00:31.574 --> 00:34.782
He certainly thinks
there's something between you two,

00:34.911 --> 00:35.616
but he's wrong.

—You sure about that?
—I don't know another way.

00:48.633 --> 00:49.918
Now you want me to re—trouble you

00:50.051 --> 00:52.508
so that you can kill
that baby's father?

00:52.637 --> 00:55.128

to go through all of that again?

Look, if I'm gonna kill this guy,

I better be damn well sure
that it's gonna work.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.723

03:08.856 --> 03:11.723

04:02.451 --> 04:05.784
I'm not worried about
turning into my brother, Nathan.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.997
Look, when Audrey touched me,
there was something about her,

04:10.126 --> 04:11.707
there was something different.

an eye on her,

As soon as we get rid of William,

04:27.101 --> 04:28.807
Audrey's gonna be fine.

04:32.898 --> 04:33.978
He's a beautiful baby, Ben.

04:35.151 --> 04:37.358
Baby?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.067
He's not a baby.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.653
He's a big boy now, huh?

04:46.454 --> 04:49.161
I'm gonna get you
your favorite blanky.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.288
Get him the one
with the planes on it.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.203
I think he likes that one the best.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.541
You're a good grandma.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.878
Well, it's easy
with such a good baby.

04:58.007 --> 05:01.920
Your daddy did a very good job
with you, Mister.

05:04.180 --> 05:06.216
You keep telling him that.

05:15.691 --> 05:18.398
Do you believe in the afterlife,
Audrey?

05:18.527 --> 05:21.064

05:21.197 --> 05:23.734
We have had ghosts here before
in Haven.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.356
[ Scoffs]
That's Haven.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.529
I'm talking about something
more universal.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.744
I don't know.

05:30.873 --> 05:31.737
Well, you know what?

05:31.874 --> 05:34.035
I've had to learn
the scientific explanation

05:34.168 --> 05:38.753
for just about everything ——
evolution, genetics.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.087
So you don't believe?

05:40.216 --> 05:41.501
No, I do.

05:41.634 --> 05:44.171
I really, really do.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.588
What, because of science?

05:45.721 --> 05:48.133
No, because of what science
can't explain.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.471
It's like our brain.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.181
It's just meat and electricity,

05:51.310 --> 05:53.767
but where does the consciousness
come from?

05:53.896 --> 05:55.102
Oh, I...

05:55.231 --> 05:58.689
I mean, we're so much more
than that.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.730

You saved that baby's life
and who knows how many others.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.462

have to do this again?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.836
Maybe.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.008
But we have a bigger problem.

08:36.892 --> 08:40.430
When Audrey gave me back
my curse,

08:40.562 --> 08:43.690
there was a moment...

08:43.816 --> 08:45.602
she changed.

08:46.402 --> 08:47.482
She started turning back

08:47.611 --> 08:49.818
into the woman
that William's been waiting for.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.687
That's what he wants.

08:52.408 --> 08:55.900
If she changes back
into what I saw...

09:00.082 --> 09:03.700
We have to get William
out of here today.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.636
Okay, the key is these four people.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.266
What four people?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.728
This whole thing
would work a lot better

09:21.854 --> 09:23.560
if I wasn't the only one
who could see it.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.307
Wait. Nathan, will you
show me your tattoo?

09:28.444 --> 09:29.980
Yeah.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.989
Okay, the four figures on the edge ——

09:33.115 --> 09:34.730
the book says if we get people
to stand on them

09:34.867 --> 09:37.654
on the symbol at the lighthouse,
then the door will appear.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.651
One, two, three, four.

09:39.788 --> 09:43.280
Unfortunately, it isn't that easy.
It has to be the right four people.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.827
The book doesn't say who they are?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.166
No, just where they're from.

09:46.295 --> 09:49.002
It talks about
"Other worlds beyond ours,

09:49.131 --> 09:51.668
places on the other side
of the void."

09:51.800 --> 09:53.176
The four people we need ——

09:53.302 --> 09:58.046
They have to have been born
in another world, like I was.

hear the barn and read the book ——

10:14.281 --> 10:16.192
I know a guy
who does Green Cards.

Okay, so four people
from other worlds.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.326
You...

10:22.498 --> 10:24.580
Obviously, William ——

10:24.708 --> 10:27.495
And... me.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.164
Who's the fourth?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.662
Vince and Dave are already looking,

10:31.799 --> 10:34.211
so we just have to hope
that they're here in Haven.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.458
Get Dwight to meet you
at the Herald.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.209

10:37.346 --> 10:39.382
And William?

10:39.515 --> 10:42.382

that he's gonna volunteer to help us.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.932

10:52.194 --> 10:54.230

10:54.363 --> 10:56.069
Yeah.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.813
Come on.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.078
Is he okay?

11:09.211 --> 11:11.497
No.

11:11.630 --> 11:15.623
And no one will be until William
is on the other side of that door.

11:16.885 --> 11:20.924
Something happened
when you troubled Duke.

11:26.895 --> 11:30.183
The woman that William
wants me to remember,

11:30.315 --> 11:32.271
my original self...

11:35.237 --> 11:36.773
Her name was Mara.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.400
When did he tell you that?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.444
He didn't.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.114
I remembered.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.039
And now do you still have
her memories?

11:49.167 --> 11:52.910
No, it's not like
remembering Lexie or...

11:53.046 --> 11:55.423
or Lucy.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.710
Mara —— she's...

11:57.843 --> 11:59.674
She's different.

12:01.597 --> 12:04.054
lt's deeper.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.594
I felt being Mara.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.301
So what was she like?

12:09.438 --> 12:12.646
She was no one I'd want to be.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.641
She did terrible, terrible things.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.109
But maybe ——

12:18.238 --> 12:21.321
maybe we can use what I saw.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.815
I'm gonna go to William.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.816
I'm going to tell him
that he was right,

12:24.953 --> 12:27.820
that when l troubled Duke,
I remembered being Mara

12:27.956 --> 12:29.332
and that I want to know more.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.824
No. That is what he wants.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.075
Exactly.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.122
He lets his guard down,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.371
and then you shoot him.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.008
What? That'll ——

12:39.134 --> 12:42.297
With a tranq gun.
He'll go unconscious.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.920
But we don't even know
how your connection to him works.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.388
That might knock you out, too.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.802
Well, then you have two people

12:48.936 --> 12:51.018
that you need to lug
to the lighthouse.

12:51.146 --> 12:55.936
Look, William knows
that Jennifer can open the door.

12:56.068 --> 12:59.731
We need to do this
before he finds a way to stop her.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.317
How do we find him?

13:02.449 --> 13:04.610
He's at the lookout.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.236
And he's waiting for me.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.615
I can feel him, Nathan.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.708
It's the connection.

13:15.837 --> 13:19.830
It keeps getting stronger
every minute.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.554
People from other worlds

13:27.683 --> 13:30.516
going in and out
of some door willy—nilly.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.056
Well, it's what I've been saying
all along.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.394
The door is dangerous.

13:34.523 --> 13:37.390
I mean, look what happened
the last time we opened it.

13:37.526 --> 13:38.891
Look what we let in.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.313
William and the guys
he brought back with him.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.982
One of them could be
our fourth person.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.731
We haven't had much luck
hanging on to those two.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.529
Well, I'm a glutton for punishment.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.778
How about you?
Ready to try again?

13:50.914 --> 13:52.245
Let's do it.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.239
Agent Howard arranged my adoption.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.083
Maybe I'm not the only one
he brought over from the other side.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.329
I'll go to the clerk's office,
pull all of their adoption records,

14:00.465 --> 14:02.330
see if Howard placed
any other children in Haven.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.253
Why is no one listening to me?

14:04.386 --> 14:06.752
We cannot open that door again.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.924
Look, Cabot's journal said ——

14:09.057 --> 14:11.298
"Great evil, agony."
Yeah, we got it, Dave.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.684
Look, we get that door open,
we send William and it all packing.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.429
Go get Cabot's journal
if you think it's so important.

14:17.566 --> 14:20.148
See if it says anything else
that can help us.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.266
All right, let's go.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.894

15:35.560 --> 15:38.302
I felt so happy...

15:38.438 --> 15:41.020
like I could never be afraid
of anything.

15:41.149 --> 15:45.267
You want to feel that way again?

15:45.403 --> 15:47.143
Yes.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.610
No, don't —— don't —— don't stop.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.577
lt's —— it —— please.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.866
It's so beautiful here.

16:02.504 --> 16:05.371
Would you walk with me

16:05.507 --> 16:07.839
and tell me about our time here?

16:09.511 --> 16:11.672
Sure.

16:20.564 --> 16:22.600
Oh, I have a better idea.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.725
That swimming hole you remember ——
it's just over there.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.728
I'd love to show you.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.402
Come with me.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.240
It hasn't changed a bit.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.956
Damn it.

16:56.308 --> 16:58.094
Cruiser saw 'em down here
an hour ago,

16:58.226 --> 16:59.682
jigging lures off the bottom.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.517
Yeah, well, have a feeling

17:01.646 --> 17:03.511
they're gonna need
a little persuading.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.264
You fire that, and you get
to persuade 'em by yourself.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.517
[Exhales deeply]
Right.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.484
No guns.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.402
Taser?

17:17.913 --> 17:19.449
I heard about a shooting
down at the Harker house.

17:19.581 --> 17:21.788
Investigating officer said
they thinks it's a suicide ——

17:21.917 --> 17:23.077
open and shut.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.166
You need better cops.

17:26.463 --> 17:30.297
We already had eight people dead.
There was about to be twice that.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.211
If I still had my daughter,

17:32.344 --> 17:34.005
I might come knocking
on your door.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.134
Haven needs more people
who can walk point.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.472
You're one of 'em.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.554
[Coughs]

17:48.526 --> 17:49.732
You okay?

17:49.861 --> 17:52.477
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.525
Let's go.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.801
There they are.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.339
What now?

18:20.475 --> 18:23.592
Now we arrest 'em.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.265
You sure we can't use
ourrealguns?

18:27.983 --> 18:29.894
Hold it right there.
Haven P.D.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.611
Big guy?

18:35.407 --> 18:37.568
Works for me.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.694
[Tasers clicking rapidly]

18:47.210 --> 18:48.996
[Clicking stops]

18:50.380 --> 18:52.496
I really wish we could use guns.

19:10.358 --> 19:14.021
Sorry.
We have to finish this later.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.251
They're like that rougarou thing.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.086
Which means William
made 'em here.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.790
So they're not born
on another world.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.257
So, even if we did catch 'em...

19:38.386 --> 19:41.219
They can't help us open that door.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.225
For all these years,
I've been helpless,

19:47.354 --> 19:50.767
as the barn hid you
from your true self,

19:50.899 --> 19:54.391
burying you deeper and deeper
under false memories.

19:54.527 --> 19:59.567
Agent Howard told me once
that the barn was my punishment.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.691
It was for what we did, wasn't it?

20:02.827 --> 20:04.943
For bringing the troubles here?

20:05.080 --> 20:08.698
Yeah, I'll never forget
the day that they dragged you in.

20:08.833 --> 20:09.948
You were screaming.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.952
You begged me to stop them,
and I couldn't.

20:13.088 --> 20:16.455
But I swore on that day
that I would save you.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.456
And even when they banished me
to that terrible place,

20:23.431 --> 20:25.046
Who was punishing me?

20:26.601 --> 20:29.013
Was it agent Howard?
Who was he?

20:29.145 --> 20:30.726
Was he like us?

20:30.855 --> 20:34.313
No. He's nothing like us.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.834
And now the...

20:54.963 --> 20:56.999
the barn —— it's gone.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.372
Yeah.

20:58.508 --> 21:02.968
And I suppose
we can thank Nathan for that.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.174
You knew?

21:06.307 --> 21:08.969
Eh, I wasn't sure.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.560
But as we walked, l—l sensed
that something was off.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.771
Our link is becoming stronger.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.515
Soon, there won't be
any secrets between us.

21:18.820 --> 21:19.730
Nathan.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.440
Cuff him.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.448
You know, they've been looking
for some good fishing bait,

21:25.577 --> 21:28.444
something that really works, so...

21:28.580 --> 21:30.320
—Tenderize him a little bit.
—No.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.747
William, make them stop!

21:33.835 --> 21:35.371
Make them stop!

21:35.503 --> 21:37.539
You make them stop.
You know how to command them.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.833
Use it.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.382
Stop!

21:48.516 --> 21:49.722
There it is.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.308
Can you feel it?

21:52.437 --> 21:57.352
That's the shell of Audrey Parker
falling away.

22:02.197 --> 22:04.529
Now put them inside.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.852
You did it,
just like Mara would have done.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.191
You can feel her, can't you?

22:42.320 --> 22:45.107
You can feel... us.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.461
We better keep going.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.546
They're not going to find us.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.507
You ready to take that chance?
You know what they'll do.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.376
We've broken every rule there is.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.174
Yeah, but we've had
so much fun doing it.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.798
Mara, they'll take you from me.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.800
No, they won't.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.973
You won't let them.

23:18.106 --> 23:20.392
Not while there's any breath
in my body.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.152
[Exhales deeply]

23:26.281 --> 23:29.489
Audrey, get away from him.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.153
—Put that down.
—No.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.993
No, that rush of power that you felt,

23:34.122 --> 23:35.908
you liked it.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.577
And you want to feel it again,
and you can.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.076
It's so easy.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.827
She's not gonna do what you want.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.876
No, she's gonna do what she wants,

23:46.009 --> 23:51.345
and what she wants to do
is to give you a trouble.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.963
Don't you, love?

23:55.476 --> 23:57.933
But he already has a trouble.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.141
What will happen?

24:02.942 --> 24:05.649
Aren't you just dying to find out?

24:09.657 --> 24:11.033
I'm sorry, Mr. Teagues,

24:11.159 --> 24:13.525
but I can't find our adoption files
at the moment.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.528
Well, perhaps you'll need to look
a little harder, Miss.

24:23.338 --> 24:26.546
—Don't you have the files?
—Why would I have them?

24:26.674 --> 24:29.632
When I arranged to have
the files lost a few weeks ago,

24:29.761 --> 24:31.376
I thought you were the one
who gave the order.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.764
No, I didn't.
Who told you I did?

24:33.890 --> 24:35.881
Your brother, Dave.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.882
Dave has the files?

24:38.019 --> 24:39.884
Yes, he picked them up himself.

24:44.359 --> 24:47.396
Dave said their secret research room
had been broken into.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.656
He's there, going through what's left,
but the Cabot journal's gone.

24:50.782 --> 24:53.569
—Someone stole it?
—That's what it looks like.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.316
Nobody's getting their hands on this.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.409
It's gonna be even harder
to find the fourth person

24:57.538 --> 24:59.074
with somebody
trying to actively stop us.

24:59.207 --> 25:02.199
Oh, good,
'cause it was easy before.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.371
[Breathes deeply]

25:05.296 --> 25:06.411
You okay?

25:06.547 --> 25:08.333
Yeah, yeah.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.673
Cold and flu season, I guess.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.258
[Exhales deeply]

25:12.387 --> 25:13.923
[Coughs]

25:14.055 --> 25:16.091
Duke?

25:16.224 --> 25:17.714
Oh, my God.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.260
Duke!

25:19.394 --> 25:20.600
Stay back.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.586
[Breathing heavily]

26:07.942 --> 26:10.149
—Duke, you okay?
—[ Gasps]

26:10.278 --> 26:12.234
How did you do that?

26:12.363 --> 26:13.978
I don't know.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.082
Audrey, you're not Mara.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.827
You could never do those things
he said you did.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.669
But I did do those things...

26:37.805 --> 26:39.511
and I liked it.

26:42.226 --> 26:47.687
And I think I might still like it.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.852
Parker, I know you.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.691
You don't want to do this.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.980
Do it.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.730
—Trouble him.
—No.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.660
Nathan.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.250
Parker.

27:10.505 --> 27:11.961
Now.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.337
What?

27:14.467 --> 27:16.674
Now.

27:35.238 --> 27:37.024
It must be some kind of side effect

27:37.156 --> 27:39.738
from Audrey giving me
back my curse.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.244
It's like a hangover
after a night of drinking.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.235
Duke, really, a hangover?

27:44.372 --> 27:46.829
Okay, worse than a hangover.

27:46.958 --> 27:49.916
Hey, I'm fine.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.284
Come here.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.751
Look, you feel hot.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.120
I think l have some Aspirin
in my car.

27:54.257 --> 27:56.873
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

27:59.053 --> 28:00.509
Listen, I saw you
cough up that blood earlier,

28:00.638 --> 28:02.094
and I saw what happened.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.804
What's really going on, man?

28:05.977 --> 28:08.559
l have no idea.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.725
Like you said, somebody's got
to walk point, right?

28:11.858 --> 28:13.064
Not all the time.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.602
You do.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.600
I mean, every day, right?

28:16.737 --> 28:19.524
Bullet magnet, chief of police.

28:19.657 --> 28:22.865
Why in God's name
would you take that job anyways?

28:22.994 --> 28:24.700
Vince asked me.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.615
Vince asked you to.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.283
That's it? That's all it took?

28:28.416 --> 28:29.531
He's been good to me.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.124
He took care of the people
who killed my daughter,

28:32.253 --> 28:33.959
did what was right.

28:34.088 --> 28:36.795
Vince walks point, too.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.506
[Door opens]

28:41.596 --> 28:43.382
Where have you been, Dave?

28:43.514 --> 28:45.129
What, Jennifer didn't tell you?

28:45.266 --> 28:48.258
Someone broke
into our research room.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.975
The Cabot journal is gone.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.811
No one broke
into our research room.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.601
You have Cabot's journal,

28:54.734 --> 28:57.942
just like you have
the adoption files.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.786
Who's the fourth person, Dave?

29:19.508 --> 29:23.046
You must believe me
when I say this, Vince.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.179
—I can't tell you.
—What?

29:27.308 --> 29:29.424
We don't keep secrets
from each other.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.222
l have a very good reason
to keep this one ——

29:32.355 --> 29:33.811
very good.

29:36.150 --> 29:38.607
Is it me?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.276
You?

29:41.405 --> 29:43.361
[Laughs]

29:43.491 --> 29:45.027
Of course you'd think it's you.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.275
It's always about you,
isn't it, Vincent?

29:47.411 --> 29:48.526
Well, guess what.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.904
It's not you this time.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.701
Then who is it?

29:53.668 --> 29:56.159
Dave, what's so special
about this person

29:56.295 --> 29:58.160
that you can't tell me?

30:01.258 --> 30:03.169
Fine.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.468
The fourth person...

30:07.598 --> 30:08.838
It's me.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.721
You know, I've always
considered you my brother ——

30:16.857 --> 30:20.224
always, since the day
l was adopted.

30:20.361 --> 30:22.192
You are my brother.

30:24.365 --> 30:27.448
lam closer to you than anyone else.

30:27.576 --> 30:31.569
I saw Agent Howard's photo
in Jennifer's file,

30:31.706 --> 30:35.324
and I didn't want anyone
to find his photo in my file.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.370
But why do you think
you're from there?

30:39.463 --> 30:40.839
I've been there.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.254
You're coming to the lighthouse.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.256
No. I can't do that.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.473
I won't!

30:53.602 --> 30:54.557
[Door opens]

30:55.938 --> 30:58.975
Do you have any Aspirin?
Duke has a headache.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.402
I think |, uh...

31:02.528 --> 31:05.611
saw some Aspirin
in your car, Vince.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.871
Dwight, don't let him leave.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.662
Damn it, Vince.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.292
If we open that door,

31:17.418 --> 31:19.659
I know I'm gonna get
pulled through again!

31:19.795 --> 31:20.955
What?

31:21.088 --> 31:24.000
When that door opens,
something draws me through it.

31:24.133 --> 31:28.046
And I don't want to go
through that again, believe me.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.131
So...

31:34.268 --> 31:35.849
What's going on?

31:40.649 --> 31:42.230
NATHAN: That's the last lantern.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.645
AUDREY: Who built this place?

31:52.369 --> 31:54.075
I don't think I want to use
this contractor

31:54.205 --> 31:55.911
when we build our dream house ——

31:56.040 --> 31:58.622
you know, two dogs,
picket fence,

31:58.751 --> 32:00.662
sea monster in the pool.

32:02.463 --> 32:03.828
And I won't even have
to worry about you

32:03.964 --> 32:05.829
turning into someone else
after we're married.

32:05.966 --> 32:07.297
Been through that already.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.712
That sounds like suburban bliss.

32:11.138 --> 32:14.346
Just hold on a little bit longer.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.181
This'll all be over soon.

32:16.310 --> 32:19.017
It's only just begun.

32:19.146 --> 32:22.354
Do you actually think
that when the time comes,

32:22.483 --> 32:24.439
she's gonna send me
through that door?

32:24.568 --> 32:27.605
We both saw it, Nathan.

32:29.490 --> 32:30.445
I've won.

32:30.574 --> 32:33.190
The only thing
that you've won today

32:33.327 --> 32:36.319
is a trip back
to whatever hell you come from.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.543
lt's physically impossible

32:41.669 --> 32:45.161
for you to injure me
without injuring her.

32:48.175 --> 32:49.676
I bet I can do it.

32:50.594 --> 32:51.583
—[ Thud]
—[ Grunts]

32:51.720 --> 32:54.302
—[ Gasps]
—Oh!

32:56.767 --> 32:59.008
[Cell phone ringing]

32:59.854 --> 33:00.764
Hey.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.979
Okay, be there in a few minutes.
Just walking up now.

33:04.108 --> 33:07.066
They have William
and a lot of questions about Dave.

33:07.194 --> 33:10.357
Hey, I'm not so sure about this
anymore.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.821
Hey, you said it yourself.
We're running out of time.

33:12.950 --> 33:15.282
Audrey could go all Sybil
at any moment, and you——

33:15.411 --> 33:17.697
I'm not worried about me.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.912
Whatever's happening,
I can control it.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.496
You don't know that.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.708
We get William through that door,
and then first order of business,

33:24.837 --> 33:26.293
we figure out how to reverse

33:26.422 --> 33:28.663
whatever it is
that Audrey did to you.

33:28.799 --> 33:32.132
What if you feel this compulsion
that Dave is talking about

33:32.261 --> 33:35.128
to go through that door, too?

33:36.432 --> 33:39.299
Long—distance relationships
are pretty hard.

33:39.977 --> 33:43.720
l have to do this, Duke.
I'm the only one who can.

33:45.274 --> 33:48.061
And there is nothing
that could ever make me

33:48.194 --> 33:51.778
go through that door
and leave you —— nothing.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.418
Dave? All this time...

34:15.554 --> 34:17.465
—|'m sorry, Audrey.
—No, he's not.

34:17.598 --> 34:21.386
And if you don't start
being cooperative, you will be.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.133
| feel faint.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.305
l have to sit.

34:24.438 --> 34:27.145
Come on, Dave.
Relax, please.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.480
You mind watching him

34:28.609 --> 34:30.565
while we try to figure out
how to do this?

34:30.694 --> 34:32.901
Oh, my pleasure.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.532
[Clears throat]

34:41.538 --> 34:43.324
What are you looking at?

34:43.457 --> 34:44.697
A dead man.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.200
You know, that's big talk for a guy
who's going where you're going.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.495
I hear it kind of sucks over there.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.499
Oh, that wasn't a threat ——

34:54.635 --> 34:56.671
just an observation.

34:56.804 --> 35:00.137
You don't know what's happening
inside you, do you?

35:00.266 --> 35:02.006
—And you do?
—Yes.

35:02.142 --> 35:04.349
Your family
has been absorbing troubles

35:04.478 --> 35:06.844
into its blood for generations.

35:06.981 --> 35:12.226
When Audrey re—troubled you,
she activated them...

35:12.361 --> 35:14.443
all of them.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.278
Every trouble your family
ever eradicated,

35:17.408 --> 35:20.525
all crammed in there,
mutating, combining,

35:20.661 --> 35:23.368
becoming something more deadly
than Mara and I could ever imagine.

35:23.497 --> 35:26.910
| just hope I'm there when they blow,
'cause it's gonna be crazy.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.953
Duke,Duke.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.044
What's wrong?
What did he say to you?

35:37.761 --> 35:39.422
Nothing.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.384
What does the book say
to do next?

35:42.516 --> 35:44.882
That's just it ——
there's no new text coming in.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.556
We're all here. I don't know
why it isn't telling me what to do.

35:47.688 --> 35:50.020
Hey, what do you think
we should do?

35:53.027 --> 35:56.440
We need to get Audrey, Dave,
and William on the figures.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.525
No...
[Breathing hard]

36:02.661 --> 36:04.447
You don't need to do this.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.196
This —— this is...
[Scared murmuring]

36:08.709 --> 36:09.824
Let's go.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.666
[Grunts]

36:11.795 --> 36:13.410
Stop squirming.

36:13.547 --> 36:14.878
As soon as we get William
through that door,

36:15.007 --> 36:16.417
we'll close it and let you go.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.836
You're all so busy trying
to push me through that door.

36:18.969 --> 36:21.506
Does anyone want to hear
what you're gonna let in?

36:21.638 --> 36:24.345
—Shut up.
—You should probably hear this.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.058
[Groans]

36:29.313 --> 36:31.770
—No!
—l've got to get out of here.

36:31.899 --> 36:35.266
And anyone who tries to stop me,
I'm gonna shoot them!

36:35.402 --> 36:37.779
There's a guy who knows what's
on the other side of that door.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.190
You and me should go for a beer.

36:40.574 --> 36:42.485
l'll shoot you, Vince, I swear.

36:42.618 --> 36:43.824
I thought we were brothers.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.658
We are brothers,
so don't make me shoot you.

36:46.497 --> 36:48.988
—|'m not going back in there!
—Dave ——

36:59.593 --> 37:00.958
He shot me.

37:01.095 --> 37:03.086
Actually, he shot me.

37:04.014 --> 37:04.969
Nice trick.

37:05.099 --> 37:07.681
When you know you're gonna
get shot, you make it count.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.516
Get him back on the figure.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.135
He'll be okay.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.398
[Groans]

37:13.524 --> 37:15.230
It's really bad, isn't it?

37:15.359 --> 37:16.815
The sooner we get this done,

37:16.944 --> 37:18.980
the sooner we're back
on The Cape Rouge.

37:19.113 --> 37:22.276
Besides, I think
it's my turn to cook.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.100
It's done.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.313
Push him in!

37:58.527 --> 37:59.482
[Groans]

38:01.572 --> 38:02.687
This party's over.

38:02.823 --> 38:04.188
—|t's time to go.
—No, no!

38:04.324 --> 38:06.280
Wait!
All right! Wait!

38:06.410 --> 38:08.401
I'm ready to negotiate!

38:08.537 --> 38:10.368
—We're not.
—You can't do this!

38:10.497 --> 38:11.612
I know you all think I deserve it,

38:11.748 --> 38:13.875
but you have no idea
what's over there.

38:14.001 --> 38:16.117
—I don't care.
—I can fix Duke.

38:16.253 --> 38:17.493
I know what's wrong with him.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.210
She likes me just the way I am.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.465
She won't for long.

38:20.591 --> 38:21.956
I know what you think I did
is terrible,

38:22.092 --> 38:25.175
but it's nothing compared
to what you're doing right now.

38:26.180 --> 38:29.172
You expect us to show you mercy
after everything you've done?

38:32.769 --> 38:34.054
Dave, what are you doing?

38:34.188 --> 38:35.928
Stop!

38:36.064 --> 38:37.440
[Whimpering]

38:39.568 --> 38:40.853
Hold on to him, Vince!

38:40.986 --> 38:44.228
Yes, that's the plan.
I could use some help!

38:44.364 --> 38:45.524
Aah!

38:53.207 --> 38:54.572
He was afraid of it.

38:54.708 --> 38:55.743
He warned me.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.741
I can't lose my brother!

38:57.878 --> 39:00.164
You're not gonna lose him.
Come on, pull, Dwight!

39:00.297 --> 39:02.663
lam pulling, but there's something
pulling back.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.414
Oh, God!

39:04.551 --> 39:07.543
[ Screaming, sobbing ]

39:12.392 --> 39:14.098
Oh, God!

39:14.228 --> 39:15.263
You loved me once.

39:15.395 --> 39:18.603
Don't do this to me.

39:18.732 --> 39:19.596
Pull!

39:32.079 --> 39:33.910
Don't try that again, Dave.

39:34.957 --> 39:35.992
Get away from her!

39:36.124 --> 39:36.954
You let him do this to me,

39:37.084 --> 39:39.075
and you'll be more evil
than Mara could ever be.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.578
Wait. He's right.
I can't let Nathan do this.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.251
This I want to do myself.

39:50.639 --> 39:51.754
I knew you were in there.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.260
[Screaming]

39:57.771 --> 40:00.103
Jennifer, get that door closed now.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.140
Go.

40:03.277 --> 40:04.938
[Thunderous rumbling]

40:23.797 --> 40:25.458
Jennﬁeﬂ

40:28.260 --> 40:29.500
Jennifer, what happened?

40:29.636 --> 40:31.172
Dave was right.

40:31.305 --> 40:33.591
We never should've opened
the door.

40:33.724 --> 40:36.682
William wasn't what
we should've been afraid of.

40:36.810 --> 40:40.769
[Breathing heavily]

40:40.897 --> 40:42.683
Jennifer, hey.

40:43.525 --> 40:44.856
Jennifer, wake up.

40:44.985 --> 40:46.350
She's not breathing.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.350
Come on.

40:47.487 --> 40:50.194
Jennifer. Jennifer.

40:50.324 --> 40:51.860
Jennifer, wake up.

40:51.992 --> 40:53.698
Wake up.

40:53.827 --> 40:55.613
Jennﬁeﬂ

40:55.746 --> 40:57.907
Jen——

40:58.040 --> 41:00.827
[Groaning]

41:03.086 --> 41:04.997
Duke.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.010
What's happening to Duke?

41:18.518 --> 41:20.054
[Coldly]
He's as good as dead.

41:22.856 --> 41:27.350
Now, who's going to help me
get William back?
