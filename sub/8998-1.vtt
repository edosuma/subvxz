01:26.719 --> 01:29.654
That's my train.

01:47.874 --> 01:51.310
Wait! Wait...!

02:02.589 --> 02:06.616
# This time tomorrow #

02:06.726 --> 02:10.491
# Where will we be? #

02:10.597 --> 02:14.158
# On a spaceship somewhere #

02:14.267 --> 02:21.139
# Sailing across an empty sea #

02:21.241 --> 02:24.938
# This time tomorrow #

02:25.044 --> 02:27.512
# What will we know? #

02:27.614 --> 02:31.948
# Will we still be here #

02:32.051 --> 02:37.648
# Watching an in-flight
movie show? #

02:37.757 --> 02:41.523
# I'll leave the sun behind me #

02:41.628 --> 02:48.158
# And I'll watch the clouds
as they sadly pass me by #

02:48.268 --> 02:51.032
# Seven miles below me #

02:51.137 --> 02:57.565
# I can see the world
and it ain't so big at all #

02:57.677 --> 02:59.577
# Oh... #

03:01.014 --> 03:03.710
# This time tomorrow #

03:03.816 --> 03:07.252
# What will we see? #

03:07.353 --> 03:10.186
# Fields full of houses #

03:10.290 --> 03:17.128
# Endless rows
of crowded streets. #

03:37.483 --> 03:39.451
Shit.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.144
Ow.

03:52.932 --> 03:56.868
Wake up,Jack.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.922
Have you seen Francis?

04:20.793 --> 04:23.057
Hello, Peter.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.002
Good afternoon. Whitman?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.545
- Yes.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.638
May I see your tickets, please?

04:47.987 --> 04:49.955
Thanks.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.787
There's no smoking, please.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.707
Welcome aboard.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.911
Sweet lime?

05:14.013 --> 05:15.503
- Yes, please. - Sure, I'll have one.
- Sounds good.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.758
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

05:36.736 --> 05:40.172
I want to start by thanking you both
for being here. Thank you.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.467
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.872
You're the two most important
people in the world to me.

05:43.976 --> 05:47.468
I've never said that before, but it's true,
and I want you both to know it.

05:49.449 --> 05:50.848
I love you, Peter.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.144
Thank you.

05:52.251 --> 05:53.445
I love you,Jack.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.215
I love you, too.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.789
How did it get to this?

05:57.890 --> 05:59.915
Why haven't we spoken in a year?

06:00.026 --> 06:01.288
Let's make an agreement.

06:01.394 --> 06:02.418
- To do what?
- Okay.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.189
A: I want us
to become brothers again

06:04.297 --> 06:06.595
like we used to be,
and for us to find ourselves

06:06.699 --> 06:07.688
and bond with each other.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.858
Can we agree to that?

06:08.968 --> 06:10.299
- Okay. - Yeah.
- B: I want us

06:10.403 --> 06:11.836
to make this trip
a spiritual journey,

06:11.938 --> 06:14.429
where each of us seek the
unknown, and we learn about it.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.598
Can we agree to that?

06:15.708 --> 06:17.266
- Sure.
- I guess so.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.470
C: I want us
to be completely open

06:19.579 --> 06:21.240
and say yes to everything,

06:21.347 --> 06:22.871
even if it's shocking and painful.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.279
Can we agree to that?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.783
Now, I had

06:25.885 --> 06:28.911
Brendan make us an itinerary.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.079
Who's Brendan?

06:30.189 --> 06:31.417
My new assistant.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.822
He's gonna place an updated
schedule under our doors

06:33.926 --> 06:35.723
every morning of all
the spiritual places

06:35.828 --> 06:37.557
and temples
that we need to see

06:37.663 --> 06:38.857
and expedite hotels

06:38.965 --> 06:40.023
and transportation and everything.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.361
How's he gonna do that?

06:41.467 --> 06:43.958
I had him bring a printer
and a laminating machine.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.162
Where is he?

06:45.271 --> 06:47.034
In a way, it actually
doesn't matter.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.904
He's in a different compartment
on another part of the train,

06:50.009 --> 06:51.806
but we never see him- ever.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.139
That's more or less it.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.372
Three, please.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.947
Does that sound okay to you?

06:56.048 --> 06:57.276
It sounds good, sure.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.611
Yeah, it sounds good.

06:58.718 --> 06:59.946
Do you have any questions?

07:00.052 --> 07:02.282
- I do.
- Okay, go ahead.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.481
What happened to your face?

07:04.657 --> 07:06.488
I only remember
certain details,

07:06.592 --> 07:08.958
but from what I've been able
to reconstruct,

07:09.061 --> 07:11.859
it was raining, I was going
about 50 miles an hour

07:11.964 --> 07:14.455
as I went into a corner,
did some wrong steering,

07:14.567 --> 07:17.434
wheels went out from me,
and I suddenly, whoo,

07:17.537 --> 07:19.528
skidded off the road,
slammed into a ditch

07:19.639 --> 07:21.834
and got catapulted
50 feet through the air.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.932
Little particles
of glass and debris

07:24.043 --> 07:25.977
were stinging my face as I flew.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.342
And for a second,
there was just total silence.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.506
Just...

07:31.150 --> 07:33.209
Then bam! The bike crashed
to the ground,

07:33.319 --> 07:34.980
exploded and caught on fire,

07:35.087 --> 07:37.954
and I smashed into the side
of a hill with my face.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.456
I was driving home.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.493
I live alone right now.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.791
Anyway, two joggers ran up
and started digging out

07:44.897 --> 07:46.660
all the dirt that was
jammed inside my mouth

07:46.766 --> 07:49.929
and my nose and my ears.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.061
My brain had stopped,
my heart had stopped,

07:52.171 --> 07:54.366
so technically I was dead
at this point.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.567
They did all the procedures
exactly right,

07:56.676 --> 07:59.577
as a result of which
I'm still alive.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.169
- Boy.
- Wow.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.878
The first thing I thought
of when I woke up was,

08:04.984 --> 08:07.578
I wish Peter and Jack were here.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.440
Have you heard anything from Mom?

08:28.541 --> 08:30.600
No.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.109
Have you?

08:32.211 --> 08:33.200
No.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.940
Me neither.

08:36.048 --> 08:38.515
Fuck.

08:41.386 --> 08:42.717
What's that?

08:42.822 --> 08:44.346
Some kind of Indian muscle relaxer.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.721
I got it at the pharmacy
next to the train station.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.521
What's that?

08:48.628 --> 08:50.186
You don't need a prescription here.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.422
A type of Indian flu medicine.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.793
It's got a tranquilizer in it.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.059
PETER: What's that?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.191
Strongest Indian
painkiller you can get.

08:56.302 --> 08:57.269
It's for my face.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.598
Be careful with that.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.865
You only want to take one drop.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.437
Shh.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.414
I also lost a tooth.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.778
You want to read a short
story I wrote in France?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.354
How long is it?

09:16.455 --> 09:17.387
What?

09:17.490 --> 09:19.515
- How long is it?
- How long is it?

09:19.625 --> 09:20.956
Never mind. Forget it.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.688
You can save it till after dinner.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.697
You know,
maybe right before

09:28.801 --> 09:31.269
whenever you're about
to take out your tooth,

09:31.370 --> 09:32.894
you should say something
like, "Please forgive this."

09:33.005 --> 09:34.438
Because it's, actually,
it's kind of...

09:34.540 --> 09:35.837
Can... you... back away a little?

09:35.942 --> 09:37.273
You just spit in my eye.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.641
When was the last time you
were in America, by the way?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.513
I don't know.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.608
The funeral.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.278
In other words, a year?

09:50.456 --> 09:52.151
I have to tell you,

09:52.258 --> 09:54.692
I support this relationship
not working out.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.357
May I take your order, please?

09:58.464 --> 09:59.362
Let's see.

09:59.465 --> 10:00.659
Do we want meat or fish?

10:00.766 --> 10:01.994
I'm gonna have the chicken.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.262
Jack, you want to try the fish?
I bet that's delicious.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.302
And, Peter, the lamb?

10:05.404 --> 10:06.735
A chicken, a fish and a lamb?

10:06.839 --> 10:07.806
How does that sound?

10:09.041 --> 10:10.804
Who wants a soup?
Raise your hand.

10:12.144 --> 10:13.543
Are those Dad's glasses?

10:13.646 --> 10:14.977
Yeah.

10:16.983 --> 10:20.248
You still have
his prescription in here.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.287
How can you see in these?

10:22.388 --> 10:23.355
Three soups.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.481
WAITER: Soup.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.989
Could you not order for me, please?

10:29.095 --> 10:30.119
What?

10:30.229 --> 10:31.958
Order for yourself.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.807
What part are you on?

10:42.908 --> 10:44.068
Nothing.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.508
It reminded me of something
not related to it.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.170
How's Alice?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.976
She's fine.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.812
She actually started
this company

10:52.918 --> 10:54.886
where she makes these
little clay pots.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.215
They're quite popular.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.516
We sent you one.

10:57.623 --> 11:00.421
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

11:00.526 --> 11:01.925
Oh, thank you.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.825
I want that stewardess.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.399
These Germans are bothering me.

11:17.977 --> 11:21.743
Ladies! Please keep it down.
Lower your voices. Thank you.

11:25.985 --> 11:29.045
Did l... raise us?

11:29.155 --> 11:31.123
Kind of?

11:33.826 --> 11:35.157
Hang on- I'm gonna ask this guy

11:35.261 --> 11:36.819
if he can get me a power adapter.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.101
She's pregnant.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.103
Alice.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.433
Really?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.405
- You're kidding.
- No.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.408
Uh, how long?

11:51.510 --> 11:53.535
Seven and a half months.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.206
So it's gonna be
born in, like,

11:56.315 --> 11:58.215
six weeks or something.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.217
I think so, yeah.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.310
I'm trying not
to get too caught up

12:02.421 --> 12:03.479
in it right now.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.079
Don't tell Francis.

12:05.191 --> 12:08.092
Brendan got the wrong voltage.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.355
Your soup, sir.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.331
Please forgive this.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.808
Hmm.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.911
Is it supposed to be sad?

12:28.013 --> 12:29.913
I think so.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.415
Well, I'm not too crazy
about the part

12:32.518 --> 12:34.418
where I start screaming
at the mechanic.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.578
That never happened.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.588
The characters are all fictional.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.590
May I take your dessert order, sir?

12:39.692 --> 12:41.057
Let's see.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.525
Do we want sweets or fruit?

12:42.628 --> 12:43.686
I'm gonna have the pudding.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.229
Jack, you want to try the cake?

12:45.331 --> 12:46.798
And, Peter, what looks good to you?

12:46.899 --> 12:48.799
The cookies?

12:48.901 --> 12:50.801
He's gonna order for himself.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.871
The cookies.

12:54.673 --> 12:56.231
Excuse me, I'm...

13:03.315 --> 13:05.715
Has he been rooting around
and taking things?

13:05.818 --> 13:07.217
Maybe.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.752
I think he's still in mourning.

13:08.854 --> 13:10.685
Well, I probably
am, too, but there's

13:10.790 --> 13:13.520
something kind of unethical
about it, isn't there?

13:13.626 --> 13:14.854
Legally those glasses

13:14.960 --> 13:16.894
belong to all three of us.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.415
I'm gonna take this bed,

13:40.519 --> 13:42.885
because I'm the oldest
and my ankle's fractured.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.354
Peter, you don't mind climbing
a ladder as I recall,

13:45.457 --> 13:47.357
so why don't you set up shop
topside?

13:47.459 --> 13:49.689
And,Jack, you're a little bit
of a lone wolf.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.025
Why don't you bunk out next door?

13:52.131 --> 13:54.099
How does that sound?

13:59.138 --> 14:00.833
Oh, sorry.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.999
- l-I was...
- FRANCIS: Stand up.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.507
Brendan, this is Jack.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.168
- Good evening.
- And this is Peter.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.506
Hello, Brendan.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.637
Nice to meet you.

14:08.747 --> 14:09.805
Let's update me.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.782
How's everything going back there?

14:12.885 --> 14:14.443
- Pretty good.
- What does that mean?

14:14.553 --> 14:15.815
I never heard back.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.548
So try again.
What are you waiting for?

14:17.656 --> 14:19.590
Well, I left a message.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.626
Why are you smiling?

14:21.727 --> 14:23.092
What do you think
he looks like

14:23.195 --> 14:24.594
under all that tape and everything?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.255
FRANCIS
Brendan, what did I tell you?!.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.696
Well, I don't know
about his face,

14:27.800 --> 14:29.734
but I think his brain
might be pretty traumatized.

14:29.835 --> 14:30.767
Damn it!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.929
Come down to this spot over here.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.266
Call her again
right now

14:34.373 --> 14:35.601
and keep calling
every ten minutes

14:35.708 --> 14:37.107
- until you get through.
- Okay.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.437
This is urgent.
We're almost there.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.102
- Okay.
- And once again,

14:40.212 --> 14:41.611
so we're explicitly clear,

14:41.714 --> 14:43.045
I don't want you
to mention this

14:43.148 --> 14:44.706
or discuss it with anyone.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.216
In other words, it's a surprise.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.649
Okay.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.550
Did you find me a power adapter?

14:49.655 --> 14:51.555
Not yet.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.557
JACK:
How long are you gonna stay here?

14:53.659 --> 14:55.559
What do you mean?

14:55.661 --> 14:57.219
He said till the end of the month.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.229
Uh-huh.

14:59.331 --> 15:01.196
Why do you ask that?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.768
I'm just trying to know so
I can figure out my plans.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.769
What plans?

15:05.871 --> 15:07.270
I don't know yet.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.432
Anyways, I've got my own
ticket,just in case.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.771
Don't tell Francis.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.209
Well, I'm not gonna stay here
with just me and him.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.548
Is that one of Alice's pots?

15:17.650 --> 15:18.708
FRANCIS: Oh.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.717
We should order some more of these.

15:20.819 --> 15:21.945
I'll tell Brendan.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.351
Okay.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.616
He has this disease where
his head is shaved,

15:25.724 --> 15:27.055
except he doesn't
have to shave it

15:27.159 --> 15:29.389
because he can't grow any
hair in the first place.

15:29.495 --> 15:32.293
Don't... talk about it
around him, though.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.660
It might offend him.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.728
Are these Dad's keys?

16:13.839 --> 16:15.170
Yeah.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.674
You've got his car keys, too?

16:17.776 --> 16:20.506
Where's those nuts at?

16:29.221 --> 16:32.315
I got it, I got it, I got
it, I got it, I got it.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.187
Good evening, Mr. Whitman.
How can I help you?

16:34.293 --> 16:36.056
Is it possible for us
to get some more

16:36.161 --> 16:37.628
of those Savoury Snacks, please?

16:37.730 --> 16:38.628
Of course.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.096
Can I offer you anything else?

16:40.199 --> 16:41.427
Um... I don't think so.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.932
I'll be right back.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.401
I forgot something.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.982
You want to smoke a cigarette
with me in the bathroom?

17:48.500 --> 17:51.025
You're crazy.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.195
What's your name?

17:53.305 --> 17:55.364
Jack. What's yours?

17:55.474 --> 17:56.964
Rita.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.634
You're beautiful.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.774
Don't come into me.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.727
Jack's got his own return ticket.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.227
He says he might leave early.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.626
What are you talking about?

18:18.730 --> 18:20.163
Don't tell him I told you.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.823
Brendan's got all the tickets.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.265
There's a whole itinerary.

18:23.368 --> 18:24.835
Where is he going?

18:31.310 --> 18:32.800
Air Italiano?

18:32.911 --> 18:34.606
What the fuck is this?

18:34.713 --> 18:36.203
I'm keeping his passport.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.249
In fact, give me yours, too.

18:38.350 --> 18:39.977
I want to keep
all the passports

18:40.085 --> 18:41.712
so nothing happens to them.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.014
I'm keeping mine.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.590
No. I want to keep
them all together.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.691
Why are you standing there?

18:53.799 --> 18:55.391
I'm waiting for you.

18:55.501 --> 18:56.900
Mr. Whitman,
the whole point

18:57.002 --> 18:58.264
of us coming
out separately

18:58.370 --> 18:59.803
is so no one sees us together.

18:59.905 --> 19:00.929
Jack.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.199
Jack.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.207
Right. I get it. Okay.
Good night, then.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.503
Go back to your compartment.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.582
Move over, please.

19:17.956 --> 19:21.221
Where are the Savoury Snacks?

19:21.326 --> 19:22.793
Huh?

19:24.663 --> 19:27.496
Did you just fuck that Indian girl?

19:28.634 --> 19:30.192
What?

19:30.302 --> 19:32.167
Sweet Lime.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.260
Of course not.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.964
I went for a walk.

19:35.073 --> 19:36.973
Something just happened.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.853
- Shh!
- Who's he talking to?

19:55.961 --> 19:58.259
No one.
He's got the code

19:58.363 --> 20:00.263
to his ex-girlfriend's
answering machine,

20:00.365 --> 20:02.094
and he's checking her messages.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.965
What? When... When did
he confide that to you?

20:05.070 --> 20:08.267
Just now.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.102
Why am I not a part of this?

20:13.779 --> 20:15.644
I've never liked that girl.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.578
Me neither.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.947
Anyway, I never trusted her.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.641
I don't feel good about myself.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.145
FRANCIS:
Okay. Let's make another agreement.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.080
On the spiritual journey,
it's crucial

20:51.183 --> 20:52.980
that we don't splinter
into factions

20:53.085 --> 20:54.143
or not include somebody

20:54.253 --> 20:55.686
who has advice and may know better.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.755
- Can we agree to that?
- Okay.

20:57.856 --> 20:59.619
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.625
Good.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.592
She put this in my suitcase.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.724
Is that her?

21:09.835 --> 21:11.564
Mm. That's her.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.070
How did she gain access
to your personal belongings?

21:14.172 --> 21:16.663
She came to see me in
France for 24 hours.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.174
Could she be gas lighting you?

21:18.277 --> 21:19.505
What's gas lighting?

21:19.611 --> 21:21.078
Okay, hang on a second.

21:21.179 --> 21:22.703
Let's make another agreement.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.907
From now on,
if you want to talk to her

21:25.017 --> 21:28.043
or check her messages,
you speak to us first.

21:28.153 --> 21:30.781
Day or night. Anytime.
Can you agree to that?

21:32.391 --> 21:34.416
I think we should destroy that.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.965
Jesus!

21:41.066 --> 21:43.591
Okay. All right.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.602
Let's check the itinerary.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.998
Give me a little light.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.042
Okay, here we go.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.543
Train stops first thing
tomorrow morning

21:53.645 --> 21:55.203
for an hour and 45 minutes,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.077
which is just enough time
for a quick visit

21:57.182 --> 21:58.581
to Temple of a Thousand Bulls,

21:58.684 --> 22:01.050
probably one of
the most spiritual places

22:01.153 --> 22:03.383
in the entire world.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.022
Wow.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.059
Power adapters!

22:43.695 --> 22:45.287
Can I get a power adapter?

22:45.397 --> 22:46.295
Yes, yes, yes.

22:46.398 --> 22:47.831
Do you have a power adapter?

22:47.933 --> 22:49.400
No, no.
No power adapter.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.366
Use battery.

22:51.470 --> 22:54.633
Do you have these in, say,
a ten-and-a-half medium?

22:54.740 --> 22:56.640
These all size.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.471
Take off shoes and try.

22:58.577 --> 22:59.805
PETER: Yeah, like that. That's good.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.811
Pepper spray. What ingredients
does this have in it?

23:01.913 --> 23:03.437
I don't want to kill
anybody or anything.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.913
No, no.
Not for killing.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.210
Spray in face.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.979
Okay. Spray in face.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.417
Spray in face.

23:11.857 --> 23:13.688
Most rare, from desert.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.350
Very poisonous.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.520
How much you want for him?

23:22.701 --> 23:24.669
This is incredible.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.275
Ring it.

23:47.392 --> 23:48.916
Take some of these
rupees and put them

23:49.027 --> 23:50.995
on this thing in front
of the deity here.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.067
Is that my belt?

24:02.674 --> 24:03.902
Can I borrow it?

24:04.009 --> 24:05.067
Well, no, not right now.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.145
I was looking for that earlier.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.246
- Ask first... next time.
- Right.

24:17.355 --> 24:19.755
Where's my passport?

24:19.858 --> 24:21.086
I got pick pocketed.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.421
My passport got stolen.

24:22.527 --> 24:23.926
Calm down.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.360
- It's not stolen.
- No, yes, it is.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.329
- It's gone.
- No, it's not.

24:27.432 --> 24:28.660
I have it.

24:28.767 --> 24:29.927
I'll be right back.

24:32.370 --> 24:33.769
You stole my passport?

24:33.872 --> 24:35.499
Peter, where are you going?

24:37.042 --> 24:39.340
I'm going to go pray
at a different thing.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.946
I hear you're leaving early.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.178
What are you talking about?

24:48.286 --> 24:50.117
I thought we made an agreement.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.519
That's why you stole my passport?

24:51.623 --> 24:53.386
Well, no, but I think
we have a chance

24:53.492 --> 24:55.426
to make this kind of a
life-changing experience,

24:55.527 --> 24:57.461
and I think we need it.

24:57.562 --> 25:00.531
In other words,
I don't want you to leave.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.066
He's going to have a
kid in six weeks.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.897
- Who?
- Him, Rubby.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.868
- He doesn't want you to know.
- "Rubby"?

25:06.972 --> 25:08.963
Yeah, you know, Rubby.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.241
Yeah.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.403
Why doesn't he want me to know?

25:16.014 --> 25:17.982
JACK:
Because we don't trust each other.

25:21.152 --> 25:23.052
Wow, right?

25:23.154 --> 25:25.588
- Yeah, amazing.
- Great, thanks.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.317
Let's get a shoeshine.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.658
Oh, hit it.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.529
Hey. Hey, come back here!

25:41.640 --> 25:43.369
- What?
- The kid just left...

25:43.475 --> 25:44.772
- Who?
- He just...

25:44.876 --> 25:45.808
Get him!

25:45.911 --> 25:47.435
- He left his shoeshine kit.
- He...

25:47.546 --> 25:49.104
Well, now he can pay
for this building.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.011
Those are $3,000 loafers!

25:51.116 --> 25:52.640
Yeah, but he only got one of them.

25:52.751 --> 25:54.218
Yeah, but that's...

25:57.722 --> 25:59.121
We're in an emergency here.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.691
I got my face smashed in,

26:00.792 --> 26:02.384
Jack's heart's been
ripped to shreds,

26:02.494 --> 26:04.155
and Rubby's having a child.

26:04.996 --> 26:05.963
Let's get into it.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.224
You told him?

26:07.332 --> 26:08.663
It's okay.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.257
Okay, that's what
we're here for,

26:10.368 --> 26:11.858
to start trusting each other.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.494
I don't get it, by the way.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.903
Why aren't we celebrating?

26:16.007 --> 26:17.702
'Cause I don't want
to talk about it.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.902
Well, why not?

26:21.680 --> 26:23.409
I guess because
I always expected

26:23.515 --> 26:25.915
eventually I'll get divorced,
so having children...

26:26.017 --> 26:27.575
really wasn't part of my plan.

26:27.686 --> 26:29.711
Okay, but you're never
gonna do better than Alice,

26:29.821 --> 26:31.220
and what's the point
in getting married...

26:31.323 --> 26:33.587
Why'd you expect to get divorced?

26:33.692 --> 26:35.660
I don't know.
I love Alice.

26:37.028 --> 26:39.656
Maybe it relates
to how we were raised.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.427
I was gonna save this
for later in the itinerary,

26:46.538 --> 26:48.768
but I think it's time.

26:48.873 --> 26:51.068
There's a ceremony I want
us to do where we each

26:51.176 --> 26:53.440
take one of these peacock feathers.

26:53.545 --> 26:54.978
We're gonna go off
into the wilderness

26:55.080 --> 26:56.104
and meditate for...

26:56.214 --> 26:57.772
Damn it, I gave them to Brendan.

26:57.882 --> 27:00.282
That's all right, we'll
do it after the next stop.

27:00.385 --> 27:01.716
Those guys are laughing at us.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.720
Where?

27:05.657 --> 27:07.557
I love it here.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.286
These people are beautiful.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.964
They're playing cricket
with a tennis ball.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.236
Hello.

27:23.341 --> 27:25.571
- How do you do?
- Hello.

27:28.346 --> 27:29.904
It's great.

27:30.015 --> 27:31.744
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.010
It's so well-written.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.881
You remember everything so clearly.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.250
Peter getting all frantic
getting the car started,

27:37.355 --> 27:39.346
you with the suitcase.

27:39.457 --> 27:41.049
The characters are all fictional.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.286
Well, anyway,
I think it's the best thing

27:43.395 --> 27:44.919
you've ever written.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.395
Thank you.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.443
Here are the peacock feathers,

28:05.550 --> 28:07.108
plus some instructions
from the guru.

28:07.218 --> 28:08.310
What's in that box?

28:08.420 --> 28:09.409
He bought a snake.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.647
It's got a skull and crossbones...

28:10.755 --> 28:12.154
Let's update me.

28:14.993 --> 28:15.925
Anything?

28:16.027 --> 28:17.790
She got the message, yeah.

28:17.896 --> 28:18.954
And?

28:19.064 --> 28:19.996
What? That's it.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.690
That's it.
She got the message.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.165
You're satisfied with that?

28:23.268 --> 28:25.133
Well, she knows you're coming.

28:25.236 --> 28:27.033
Does she want to see us?

28:27.138 --> 28:29.504
But she's your mother.

28:41.986 --> 28:44.079
Happy birthday...
from last year.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.287
I can't accept this.
It's too valuable.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.485
It's got one
wrong initial,

28:49.594 --> 28:50.891
but you can paint over it.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.053
It's from me and Jack.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.083
Yes?

29:15.186 --> 29:16.346
RITA: Would you like tea?

29:16.454 --> 29:17.478
Okay.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.226
Thank you.

29:55.627 --> 29:59.586
#You talk like Marlene Dietrich #

29:59.697 --> 30:03.292
# And you dance
like Zizi Jeanmaire #

30:03.401 --> 30:06.268
# Your clothes are
all made by Balmain #

30:06.371 --> 30:07.895
I got to get off this train.

30:08.006 --> 30:11.032
# And there's diamonds
and pearls in your hair #

30:11.142 --> 30:13.702
# Yes, there are #

30:13.812 --> 30:17.543
# You live in a fancy apartment #

30:17.649 --> 30:22.916
# Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel... #

30:23.021 --> 30:24.784
What's her name again?

30:24.889 --> 30:25.913
Rita.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.718
What'd you say?

30:36.568 --> 30:38.763
There's a hole in it.

30:38.870 --> 30:39.802
He escaped.

30:39.904 --> 30:41.769
No, he didn't.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.568
How?

30:52.250 --> 30:53.979
PETER:
Now-Now you believe me, assholes?

30:56.187 --> 31:00.317
We think a snake might
have gotten on board.

31:03.962 --> 31:07.921
# But where do you go to,
my lovely #

31:08.032 --> 31:10.296
# When you're alone
in your bed? #

31:14.439 --> 31:15.667
Don't go in there, Rita.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.609
FRANCIS: You got him!

31:35.293 --> 31:37.727
I'm kicking you off
at the next station.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.160
Please don't do that.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.788
We're very sorry.
It won't happen again.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.628
I know it won't.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.065
What's that smell?

31:44.168 --> 31:45.658
Voltaire Number Six.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.538
Do you have
a prescription for these?

31:52.644 --> 31:55.738
A prescription?
I almost died.

31:57.982 --> 31:59.006
Give me a second.

31:59.117 --> 32:02.280
# Where do you go to,
my lovely #

32:02.387 --> 32:05.515
# When you're alone
in your bed? #

32:06.858 --> 32:10.453
# Tell me the thoughts
that surround you #

32:10.561 --> 32:12.290
That animal's deadly poisonous

32:12.397 --> 32:14.024
and you brought him onto my train.

32:14.132 --> 32:15.599
We didn't know.
It was an accident.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.066
We're just trying
to experience something.

32:20.638 --> 32:22.833
It's very important to us.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.284
You're confined
to your compartment

32:35.386 --> 32:36.580
until further notice.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.521
Is our snake getting confiscated?

33:11.656 --> 33:13.487
Do you think it's working?

33:13.591 --> 33:15.218
Do we feel something?

33:15.326 --> 33:18.056
- I hope so.
- It's got to.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.656
Do you trust me?

34:30.234 --> 34:31.724
Where are we?

34:56.226 --> 34:57.854
Brendan, what's going on?

34:57.962 --> 35:00.726
I don't know. I guess
the train's lost.

35:00.832 --> 35:01.992
What'd he say?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.158
He says the train's lost.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.167
How can a train be
lost? It's on rails.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.430
Apparently we took a wrong
turn at some point last night.

35:07.538 --> 35:08.436
That's crazy.

35:08.539 --> 35:09.665
How far off course are we?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.674
Nobody knows-we haven't
located us yet.

35:11.776 --> 35:12.936
What'd you just say?

35:13.044 --> 35:13.976
What?

35:14.078 --> 35:15.636
What you just said.
Say it again.

35:15.746 --> 35:16.713
We haven't located us yet.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.076
Aah!

35:18.182 --> 35:19.809
Is that symbolic?

35:19.917 --> 35:24.115
"We... haven't
located... us... yet."

35:24.222 --> 35:25.553
Where's those feathers at?

35:25.656 --> 35:28.181
In the envelope
I gave you this morning.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.419
Meet me on top of
that thing out there.

35:48.746 --> 35:51.772
The guru told me
when the moon turns...

35:57.989 --> 35:59.616
Do you trust me?

36:03.161 --> 36:05.254
I hired a private detective
to track down Mom.

36:05.363 --> 36:08.332
She's living in a convent in
the foothills of the Himalayas.

36:08.432 --> 36:10.024
We'll be there in six days.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.747
How is that possible?

36:23.848 --> 36:26.749
I guess she became a nun,
apparently.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.840
You know what she's like.

36:27.952 --> 36:28.884
A nun?

36:28.986 --> 36:29.884
Apparently.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.887
Did you talk to her?

36:31.989 --> 36:33.013
No, I didn't.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.352
Does she know we're coming?

36:34.458 --> 36:35.925
I think so.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.723
How do you know she wants to see us?

36:38.829 --> 36:41.821
She probably doesn't.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.332
But maybe she does.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.565
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

36:47.672 --> 36:50.106
Because I'm trying
to protect you

36:50.208 --> 36:53.234
from all the painful emotions
this is probably gonna stir up.

36:53.344 --> 36:55.642
Well, aren't you kind of
doing that right now?

36:55.746 --> 36:57.373
Yeah.

36:57.481 --> 36:59.813
I'm scared, too.

36:59.917 --> 37:03.148
She's obviously suffered
some kind of mental collapse

37:03.254 --> 37:05.347
and we've got to go get her
and bring her back home.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.257
Actually, it's in the itinerary,

37:09.360 --> 37:11.294
but I put it under "T.B.D."

37:13.831 --> 37:14.991
Why are you laughing?

37:16.734 --> 37:18.224
You didn't tell us
'cause we never

37:18.336 --> 37:19.963
would've come here
if we knew about it.

37:25.142 --> 37:27.576
I'm gonna hold this in
for a little while.

37:50.735 --> 37:53.568
You gonna drink that whole
bottle of cough medicine?

37:53.671 --> 37:56.299
That's a dumb way to get loaded.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.577
Let's look at the itinerary.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.706
Fuck the itinerary.

38:07.385 --> 38:10.548
You know, I think I'm gonna have
to get that belt back after all.

38:10.655 --> 38:14.386
Because it cost me $6,000
and it was made special for me.

38:15.993 --> 38:17.483
We'll get you a different present.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.028
I don't think so.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.189
What is that supposed to mean?

38:21.299 --> 38:24.097
It means there's been too much
Indian giving over the years.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.373
These guys are driving me crazy.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.341
Is there an empty compartment
I can move into?

38:36.447 --> 38:38.540
No, there isn't.
We're fully booked.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.345
I really want to kiss you
right now. Can l?

38:45.323 --> 38:46.551
No.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.249
No?

38:48.359 --> 38:51.021
But we already... did it.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.095
I have a boyfriend.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.857
You do?

38:53.964 --> 38:56.797
Actually, I just broke up with him.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.425
Or I'm about to.

39:00.805 --> 39:03.069
I really need someone
to talk to right now.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.405
And I feel like you might be
very important to me in my life.

39:09.213 --> 39:10.305
All right.

39:26.897 --> 39:27.955
What did I tell you?

39:28.065 --> 39:29.396
Get back in your room.

39:33.504 --> 39:34.937
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

39:35.039 --> 39:36.904
- I rang the bell.
- I'll be right there.

39:50.154 --> 39:53.146
Is that Dad's razor?

39:53.257 --> 39:54.246
Yeah.

39:54.358 --> 39:55.848
Can I say something?

39:55.960 --> 39:57.291
What?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.522
You don't have permission
to take his property

39:59.630 --> 40:01.860
that belongs to all of us
and use it for yourself

40:01.966 --> 40:03.024
as if it's yours.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.897
Jack agrees with that.
Right,Jack?

40:05.002 --> 40:07.232
Plus, Dad would've hated it.

40:07.338 --> 40:08.327
Why?

40:08.439 --> 40:09.667
That's my opinion.

40:09.774 --> 40:11.105
I knew him well.

40:12.943 --> 40:14.376
That's a terrible thing to say.

40:14.478 --> 40:15.809
Well, I don't mean it to be.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.676
I just don't want you
to get the feeling

40:17.782 --> 40:19.545
that you're better friends
with him than we are

40:19.650 --> 40:21.117
or something weird like that.

40:21.218 --> 40:23.152
And, also, you can't
leave your wife

40:23.254 --> 40:24.312
just because she's pregnant.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.390
Jack agrees with that, too.
Right,Jack?

40:26.490 --> 40:28.424
Stop including me.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.323
I was his favorite.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.988
He told me that with blood all
over him laying in the street

40:33.097 --> 40:34.394
right before he died.

40:37.301 --> 40:39.963
How is that supposed
to make us feel?

40:42.173 --> 40:44.038
I want my passport back.

40:44.141 --> 40:46.234
Francis?

40:46.343 --> 40:47.605
Yeah?

40:47.711 --> 40:49.008
Here's your belt.

40:58.923 --> 41:00.891
Fuck. Stop!

41:13.404 --> 41:15.235
- You don't love me!
- Yes, I do!

41:15.339 --> 41:17.239
I love you, too, but I'm gonna
mace you in the face!

41:17.341 --> 41:18.740
Stop!

41:25.749 --> 41:26.773
I had to do it!

41:26.884 --> 41:28.374
Jack!
You maced us!

41:31.789 --> 41:33.552
Stop including me!

41:55.212 --> 41:56.611
BRENDAN: I'll find us a hotel.

41:56.714 --> 41:58.614
Next train's in 24 hours.

41:58.716 --> 42:00.650
This just came in.

42:00.751 --> 42:02.742
Why are your eyes all red?

42:02.853 --> 42:05.344
Why is your head so bald?

42:05.456 --> 42:07.549
Because I have alopecia.

42:07.658 --> 42:09.091
Oh, yeah.

42:09.193 --> 42:12.094
That's like albino, right?

42:12.196 --> 42:14.221
Not really.

42:14.331 --> 42:16.299
Jack maced us.

42:25.242 --> 42:26.607
Was I just mean to Brendan?

42:26.710 --> 42:28.302
He's not coming back.

42:28.412 --> 42:29.743
He just quit.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.111
He did, didn't he?

42:32.216 --> 42:33.740
Can we at least get our snake back?

42:33.851 --> 42:35.409
It's dead.

42:35.519 --> 42:37.146
You killed him?

42:39.723 --> 42:41.554
Your fake tooth's gone.

42:41.659 --> 42:43.559
Fuck.

42:45.563 --> 42:46.894
What did you say?

42:46.997 --> 42:48.760
Shame on you.

42:54.138 --> 42:55.730
Did you get maced, too?

42:55.839 --> 42:59.275
No, I'm crying.

43:09.119 --> 43:11.019
What's wrong with you?

43:13.123 --> 43:14.590
Let me think about that.

43:14.692 --> 43:16.592
I'll tell you
the next time I see you.

43:16.694 --> 43:20.221
Sure, tell me then.

43:22.499 --> 43:24.296
Thanks for using me.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.372
You're welcome.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.778
Good-bye, Rita.

43:39.883 --> 43:41.908
FRANCIS: So long, Sweet Lime.

44:22.726 --> 44:24.057
"Dear boys..."

44:24.161 --> 44:25.594
WOMAN'S VOICE: Bad timing.

44:25.696 --> 44:27.994
This morning I received the
details of your travel plans

44:28.098 --> 44:31.590
in a document sent to me
from a man named Brendan.

44:31.702 --> 44:33.567
Unfortunately,
I cannot receive you now..

44:33.671 --> 44:36.196
A neighboring village requires
our urgent assistance

44:36.306 --> 44:38.604
due to an emergency,
not to mention the recent

44:38.709 --> 44:41.337
arrival of a man-eating tiger
in the region.

44:41.445 --> 44:42.878
I suggest you come
in the spring

44:42.980 --> 44:44.504
when you'll be safe with me.

44:44.615 --> 44:46.207
You must know how sad I am

44:46.316 --> 44:48.546
to experience this long separation.

44:48.652 --> 44:51.485
I hope you'll eventually
understand and forgive me.

44:51.588 --> 44:54.318
God bless you and keep you with
Mary's benevolent guidance

44:54.425 --> 44:56.290
in the light of Christ's
enduring grace.

44:56.393 --> 44:58.554
All my love, your mother,

44:58.662 --> 45:00.721
Sister Patricia Whitman.

45:00.831 --> 45:02.822
FRANCIS:
That sounds like bullshit to me.

45:02.933 --> 45:04.366
- JACK: Me, too.
- PETER: Obviously.

45:04.468 --> 45:07.130
She's trying to sell us
a vacuum cleaner.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.211
Let's get high.

45:35.833 --> 45:36.993
I'm sorry.

45:39.703 --> 45:40.829
Me, too.

45:40.938 --> 45:42.735
I wasn't trying to aim
for your face.

45:45.375 --> 45:48.674
Doesn't matter,
it's already demolished.

45:48.779 --> 45:50.303
Let's just go home.

45:50.414 --> 45:51.938
She doesn't want to see us anyway.

45:52.049 --> 45:55.041
You don't think so?

45:55.152 --> 45:57.052
Not even on some primordial level?

45:57.154 --> 45:59.554
No.

45:59.656 --> 46:02.750
FRANCIS:
She's been disappearing all our lives.

46:02.860 --> 46:07.092
We weren't raised
to be treated like that.

46:07.197 --> 46:09.165
It's just not done.

46:09.266 --> 46:12.758
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to happen.

46:12.870 --> 46:14.997
It could all be part of it.

46:15.105 --> 46:18.871
Maybe this is where the
spiritual journey ends.

46:26.183 --> 46:27.172
You read the instructions,

46:27.284 --> 46:28.911
right?

46:32.356 --> 46:34.381
Okay, let's do it.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.355
I'm gonna go over here.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.487
Yeah, g... that's good,
get on the rock. Yeah.

46:40.597 --> 46:42.326
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Peter, you get... Yeah.

46:42.432 --> 46:43.990
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah. - Yeah.

46:44.101 --> 46:45.432
- Ah! Oh!
- Shalom.

46:49.873 --> 46:52.467
Okay, that's it.
That's it.

46:52.576 --> 46:53.702
Okay.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.779
Well, all right.

47:06.890 --> 47:08.721
Which direction did yours go?

47:08.826 --> 47:09.986
What do you mean?

47:10.093 --> 47:11.321
Your feathers.

47:11.428 --> 47:12.895
Mine blew towards the mountains.

47:12.996 --> 47:15.556
That's not right- it's
not supposed to get blown away.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.930
You're supposed
to blow on it...

47:18.035 --> 47:19.400
and then bury it.

47:19.503 --> 47:20.800
I didn't get that.

47:20.904 --> 47:22.428
I still have mine.

47:22.539 --> 47:23.938
You guys didn't do it right.

47:24.041 --> 47:25.941
I asked you
if you read the instructions.

47:26.043 --> 47:28.637
You did it wrong.

47:31.415 --> 47:33.940
I tried my hardest.

47:34.051 --> 47:36.815
I don't know what else to do.

47:39.289 --> 47:42.554
I don't think Dad
would have hated it.

47:42.659 --> 47:45.423
Did he really say
you were his favorite?

47:46.496 --> 47:47.758
I don't know

47:47.865 --> 47:49.560
I could barely understand him.

47:49.666 --> 47:51.827
He wasn't really breathing.

47:51.935 --> 47:53.664
I wonder if the three of us

47:53.770 --> 47:55.965
could have been friends
in real life.

47:56.073 --> 47:58.564
Not as brothers but as people.

47:58.675 --> 48:02.338
Well, we probably would've had
a better chance, I guess.

48:05.182 --> 48:06.911
Let's make another agreement:

48:07.017 --> 48:09.178
we'll all come back here
in the spring when...

48:09.286 --> 48:11.550
We're never coming back here.

48:11.655 --> 48:14.954
Let's just find an airport
and go our separate ways.

48:17.794 --> 48:20.661
Wouldn't it sound great
if you could hear a train

48:20.764 --> 48:23.665
going by off in the
distance right now?

48:23.767 --> 48:26.395
- Not really.
- Probably be annoying.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.218
Look at these assholes.

48:51.428 --> 48:52.793
That's gonna tip over.

48:55.666 --> 48:56.655
Go!

49:02.806 --> 49:04.433
Get the little one.

49:05.175 --> 49:07.040
Francis!

49:07.144 --> 49:09.169
Grab him!

49:12.149 --> 49:15.175
Don't let go of me.

49:15.285 --> 49:16.946
PETER: He's all tangled up.

49:28.665 --> 49:31.361
Hang on, hang on.
I got you.

49:32.502 --> 49:34.527
PETER: I can't get him out!

49:39.476 --> 49:40.909
Peter!

49:50.354 --> 49:52.584
He's all bloody!

49:57.094 --> 49:58.994
He's dead. He's dead.

49:59.096 --> 50:00.996
- He's dead?
- The rocks killed him.

50:01.098 --> 50:02.326
You're bleeding like crazy.

50:02.432 --> 50:04.161
FRANCIS: Peter! You okay?

50:04.267 --> 50:06.167
I didn't save mine.

50:09.573 --> 50:11.700
What's his name?

50:40.804 --> 50:43.272
- Papa! Papa!
- Hey!

50:57.154 --> 50:59.315
No.

52:10.861 --> 52:12.886
Thank you.

53:46.323 --> 53:48.917
PETER:
Can you explain that I almost had him?

53:52.696 --> 53:54.630
I lost him when
we went off the rocks.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.289
He was too slippery.

53:56.399 --> 53:59.425
I had him the whole
rest of the time.

53:59.536 --> 54:02.334
I want them to know that.

54:19.089 --> 54:22.115
What you doing in this place?

54:22.225 --> 54:23.749
Well, originally, I guess,

54:23.860 --> 54:26.021
we came here
on a spiritual journey,

54:26.129 --> 54:28.461
but that didn't really pan out.

54:55.425 --> 54:57.825
We're invited to the funeral.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.762
Okay.

55:18.081 --> 55:19.742
# Where you going? #

55:19.849 --> 55:22.010
# I don't mind #

55:22.118 --> 55:26.953
# I've killed my world
and I've killed my time #

55:27.057 --> 55:29.218
# So where do I go? #

55:29.326 --> 55:31.658
# What will I see? #

55:31.761 --> 55:36.198
# I see many people
coming after me #

55:36.299 --> 55:39.132
# So where are you going to? #

55:39.235 --> 55:41.328
# I don't mind #

55:41.438 --> 55:43.235
# If I live too long #

55:43.340 --> 55:46.104
# I'm afraid I'll die #

55:46.209 --> 55:48.268
# So I will follow you #

55:48.378 --> 55:50.608
# Wherever you go #

55:50.714 --> 55:52.579
# If your offered hand #

55:52.682 --> 55:55.879
# Is still open to me #

55:55.985 --> 56:00.513
# Strangers on this road
we are on #

56:00.623 --> 56:03.751
# We are not two,
we are one #

56:10.433 --> 56:14.836
# So you've been
where I've just come #

56:14.938 --> 56:19.102
# From the land
that brings losers on #

56:19.209 --> 56:23.771
# So we will share
this road we walk#

56:23.880 --> 56:28.476
# And mind our mouths
and beware our talk#

56:28.585 --> 56:33.045
# Till peace we find,
tell you what I'll do #

56:33.156 --> 56:37.456
# All the things I own,
I will share with you #

56:37.560 --> 56:41.929
# And if I feel tomorrow
like I feel today #

56:42.031 --> 56:44.261
# We'll take what we want #

56:44.367 --> 56:47.928
# And give the rest away... #

56:52.876 --> 56:55.401
I can't believe you just said that.

56:55.512 --> 56:56.877
Why not?
It's the truth.

56:56.980 --> 56:58.345
He didn't really mean it.

56:58.448 --> 56:59.881
I think you're all
equally grief-stricken.

56:59.983 --> 57:01.348
Let's just leave it at that.

57:01.451 --> 57:02.679
When does Mom get in?

57:02.786 --> 57:03.912
She's going straight there

57:04.020 --> 57:06.079
from the airport.

57:08.091 --> 57:09.854
I want to pick up the car.

57:09.959 --> 57:11.859
We're already late.

57:11.961 --> 57:13.360
Tell the driver

57:13.463 --> 57:15.488
- to take a right.
- We don't have time.

57:15.598 --> 57:18.567
- Let's do this later.
- No. I want to get it now.

57:18.668 --> 57:19.965
Uh, excuse me?

57:20.069 --> 57:22.128
I'm sorry, uh, we're gonna
need to make a stop first

57:22.238 --> 57:23.637
at this address.

57:26.843 --> 57:29.073
Go ahead- I'll be right behind you.

57:29.179 --> 57:31.010
I think we should wait for you.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.081
Why?

57:33.683 --> 57:36.243
Francis.

57:36.352 --> 57:38.820
Tell them we'll be there
in five minutes.

57:54.571 --> 57:57.005
MAN: Hey, hey...

57:57.106 --> 57:59.301
Hey.

57:59.409 --> 58:02.606
Yeah, we're here to pick up
Mr. Whitman's car.

58:02.712 --> 58:04.475
No, Mr. Whitman's car is not ready.

58:04.581 --> 58:05.946
What do you mean, it's not ready?

58:06.049 --> 58:08.108
No, we're waiting for...
a part.

58:08.218 --> 58:09.981
- A part?
- Yeah.

58:10.086 --> 58:11.883
Uh, I left a message
with his secretary.

58:11.988 --> 58:12.977
No, no, no, that's crazy.

58:13.089 --> 58:14.488
This car's been here
for three months.

58:14.591 --> 58:15.649
He can't wait any longer.

58:15.758 --> 58:16.884
He'll have to wait another week.

58:16.993 --> 58:17.960
Uh, I left a message.

58:18.061 --> 58:19.358
Yeah, he didn't get the message.

58:19.462 --> 58:21.953
Mr. Whitman is dead.
You understand?

58:25.368 --> 58:26.733
Jimmy Whitman?

58:26.836 --> 58:28.235
Yeah.

58:28.338 --> 58:29.862
What happened to him?

58:29.973 --> 58:31.941
He got hit by a taxi.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.167
And it killed him?

58:33.276 --> 58:34.800
Yeah.

58:34.911 --> 58:37.402
His change was scattered
all over72nd Street.

58:39.782 --> 58:42.250
Oh, you're his sons.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.843
Right. And we're gonna
take this car

58:44.954 --> 58:46.819
to his funeral, which
we're late for, right now.

58:46.923 --> 58:47.981
Where are the keys?

58:48.091 --> 58:49.786
Peter, we'll come back
later and get the car.

58:49.893 --> 58:50.882
It's not ready, right?

58:50.994 --> 58:53.462
It's not ready.

59:13.016 --> 59:15.678
The battery's dead, too.

59:19.155 --> 59:20.315
FRANCIS: There it is.

59:20.423 --> 59:22.584
That's the other one.
We found it.

59:22.692 --> 59:24.853
We're still waiting for a part
to come in from Stuttgart.

59:24.961 --> 59:25.893
Where's a battery charger?

59:25.995 --> 59:26.962
What are you doing?

59:27.063 --> 59:28.428
- This one's mine.
- No, it's not.

59:28.531 --> 59:30.897
We need to take it home and
enter it in the inventory.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.991
I'm taking this suitcase.

59:33.102 --> 59:34.763
You going somewhere?

59:36.272 --> 59:37.330
I don't know.

59:37.440 --> 59:40.273
Where's the goddamn battery charger?

59:40.376 --> 59:41.604
Ah, aha!

59:41.711 --> 59:43.338
Guess he didn't read
my book in time.

59:43.446 --> 59:45.073
What do you mean?
In time for what?

59:45.181 --> 59:46.239
The envelope's never been opened.

59:46.349 --> 59:48.146
Oh, you mean when
he was still alive.

59:52.622 --> 59:56.558
WOMAN
Phone call for a Francis Whitman.

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.426
Hello.

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:02.930
ALICE: They want to start.

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.795
Send the car back for us.
The battery's dead.

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:06.232
They can only wait ten minutes.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:07.928
There's another service after us.

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:10.369
Okay, well, we might not
make it, then.

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.464
I guess just...

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:14.566
tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.508
Hold the line.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.944
No, you're going to start
when they get here,

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:19.105
not one second before.

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:21.706
Is that perfectly clear?
Is that perfectly clear?

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:22.842
Try to be quick.

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:23.976
Okay.

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:25.452
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.921
I spoke to your mother.
She's not coming.

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:29.423
She didn't get on the plane.

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:30.924
Why not?

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:32.688
I don't know. I'm sorry.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:37.528
Will you tell Peter and Jack, so
they don't expect to see her?

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.067
Yeah.

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.999
ALICE: I'm sorry.

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.732
Thanks, Alice.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.364
Thank you.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.705
RECEPTIONIST: You're welcome.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.370
Put it in second.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.675
Put it in second!

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:55.484
Pop it!

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:00.821
Watch it, asshole!

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:05.321
What do you want?

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.452
Are you kidding me?

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:07.529
Fuck, no.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.325
You get back in your car right now.

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.024
Get back in that car!

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.645
This isn't gonna work.

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.944
- Let's put the cover back on it.
- Let's go.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.316
FRANCIS: Come on. Steer it in.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.530
Let's go.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.548
Who called?

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.385
Alice.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.788
What'd she say?

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.086
They're waiting.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:12.821
Mom there?

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:14.658
Not yet.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.104
Hey...

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.769
hey, help him up.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.139
You okay?

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.111
Let me help you.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.981
Whitman.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.421
The flight boards in 25 minutes.

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:38.015
Let's set aside the next ten
minutes to use as free time.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.095
Do a little shopping,
have a snack,

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.426
make a phone call, and then
we'll meet in the bathroom

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:45.762
next to that statue over there
at about a quarter after,

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:48.098
get cleaned up,
brush your teeth,

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.900
have a shave or what have you,
and in our last five minutes

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.407
we'll sit quietly in
that little shrine over there,

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.704
say a prayer and think about
everything we've been through.

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:02.982
Three, please.

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:07.418
I love the way this country smells.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.717
I'll never forget it.

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.485
It's kind of spicy.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.754
Who's he talking to?

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.064
I think he's trying
to rehire Brendan.

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.396
He said he's gonna
offer him a 50% raise

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.663
plus some medical benefits
to help with his albino disease

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:24.035
or whatever it's called.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.072
How'd it go?

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.971
He's gonna think about it.

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:29.203
He's gotta get hired
back, because otherwise

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:31.609
I'm probably just a bad person.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.341
And in some ways l
feel like Brendan

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:36.043
might be my...
friend maybe.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.585
I'll be right back.

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.518
He didn't really kill
our snake, did he?

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.527
I mean, it's gotta be
against his religion.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.857
I bet he just sent him

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.157
out into the desert, which is...

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.391
actually closer to his
natural habitat.

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:51.898
Who's he talking to?

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:56.394
Probably checking his
ex-girlfriend's messages again.

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:57.995
I thought we made an agreement.

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.699
Why didn't you stop him?

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.676
What'd you find out this time?

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:08.113
She's gonna meet me in Italy.

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:09.343
Oh, man, that's terrible.

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:11.386
I know.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:12.886
I'll be right back.

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:20.191
Let's look at the itinerary.

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:39.647
Is that from Sweet Lime?

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:40.908
Who's he talking to?

01:08:41.015 --> 01:08:42.313
I didn't say that.

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:44.682
I didn't want... Hello?

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.290
Alice, I guess.

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.357
It's a boy.

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:00.399
It got born already?

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:01.492
It's gonna be a boy.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.764
She had a sonogram or something.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:03.770
It's a boy?

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:04.840
That's incredible!

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:05.907
- Wow!
- Yeah.

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.304
Why were you yelling?

01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:15.076
She's angry 'cause I didn't tell
her I was coming here.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.084
Ever?
Until just now?

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:18.483
Yeah.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.417
But I explained everything.

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:25.620
It's actually kind of lucky
'cause I got this vest.

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:27.491
It can work with either one,

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:29.621
but I think it's better for a man.

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:36.270
Here, he can inherit this.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:39.765
It's from me and Jack.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.707
Thanks.

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.520
Can I use those scissors?

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:02.288
I guess I've still got
some more healing to do.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.992
You're getting there, though.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.155
Anyway, it's
definitely gonna add

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.062
a lot of character to you.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.421
What should we pray for now?

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.445
Didn't you get my letter?

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.784
I told you to come back
in the spring.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.653
Should we go?

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:17.691
Of course not.

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:21.092
Welcome, my beautiful boys.

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:24.893
Francie, Peter, Little Jack.

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.200
What happened to your face?

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:34.799
I smashed into a hill
on purpose on my motorcycle.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.277
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.938
There's so many things

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.141
we don't know about
each other, aren't there?

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:45.685
Who's this?

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:48.951
That's Oberoi.
He got us here.

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:51.851
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.154
What are you saying to him?

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.196
I'm telling him
to lock up your horses.

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:56.355
There's a tiger.

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:57.693
Really? We thought
that was bullshit.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.234
You call that bullshit?

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:05.438
He ate one of the Sister's brothers.

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.843
I'm not kidding.

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.242
# Praise him #

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:16.750
# Praise him, praise him
in the morning #

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:21.050
# Praise him
when the sun goes down #

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:25.616
# Love him, love him #

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:30.494
# Love him in the morning,
love him in the noontime #

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:34.865
# Love him, love him. #

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.941
What do we want for breakfast?

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:48.482
Jack, you'll like
the porridge,

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:51.576
Peter, fresh mango, and
cornflakes for you, Francie.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:54.178
Now who wants scrambled
eggs? Raise your hand.

01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:58.957
What's on fire in that
hideous little flowerpot?

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:00.289
Alice made that.

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:01.726
Oh, it's darling.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.161
Tell her I said so.

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:04.425
Okay.
You want one?

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:06.091
Of course I do.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:09.932
# Everybody knows #

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:12.336
# But don't play with me #

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:16.337
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:21.077
# Your mother, she's... #

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:24.517
PETER: Mom?

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.587
Uh-huh?

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:28.955
There's one last thing.

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.471
I want to tell you about my son.

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:44.834
What son?

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.736
The one I'm gonna have next month.

01:15:48.537 --> 01:15:49.936
Well, you should be with Alice.

01:15:50.039 --> 01:15:52.234
You should have been
at Dad's funeral.

01:15:52.341 --> 01:15:55.504
So that's why you came here.

01:15:55.611 --> 01:15:57.738
We came here because we miss you.

01:15:57.847 --> 01:15:59.508
I miss you, too.

01:15:59.615 --> 01:16:01.674
But why didn't you
come to Dad's funeral?

01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:05.049
Because I didn't want to.

01:16:06.722 --> 01:16:09.190
Why are we talking this way?

01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:10.952
What's wrong with us?

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:11.958
We should be celebrating.

01:16:12.061 --> 01:16:13.528
What are you doing here?

01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:15.563
I live here.

01:16:15.664 --> 01:16:16.688
These people need me.

01:16:16.799 --> 01:16:18.494
What about us?

01:16:26.642 --> 01:16:28.542
You're talking to her.

01:16:28.644 --> 01:16:30.839
You're talking to someone else.

01:16:30.946 --> 01:16:32.345
You're not talking to me.

01:16:32.448 --> 01:16:34.541
I don't know the answers
to these questions

01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:37.084
and I don't see myself this way.

01:16:37.186 --> 01:16:38.118
Listen.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.451
I'm sorry we lost your father.

01:16:42.858 --> 01:16:45.952
We'll never get over it,
but it's okay.

01:16:46.061 --> 01:16:48.222
There are greater forces at work.

01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:54.166
Yes, the past happened,
but it's over, isn't it?

01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:55.999
Not for us.

01:17:03.145 --> 01:17:05.545
I told you not to come here.

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:18.559
Maybe we could express
ourselves more fully

01:17:18.661 --> 01:17:21.653
if we say it without words.

01:17:26.802 --> 01:17:29.236
Should we try that?

01:17:39.048 --> 01:17:42.074
# Well, you've got
your diamond #

01:17:42.184 --> 01:17:46.120
# And you've got
your pretty clothes #

01:17:46.222 --> 01:17:50.454
# And the chauffeur drives
your cars #

01:17:50.559 --> 01:17:54.620
#You let everybody know #

01:17:54.730 --> 01:17:58.257
# But don't play with me #

01:17:58.367 --> 01:18:00.733
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

01:18:04.473 --> 01:18:07.636
# Your mother,
she's an heiress #

01:18:07.743 --> 01:18:10.769
# Owns a block
in St.John's Wood #

01:18:12.314 --> 01:18:17.718
# And your father'd be there
with her #

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.983
# If he only could #

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:24.423
# But don't play with me #

01:18:24.526 --> 01:18:26.084
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

01:18:39.675 --> 01:18:43.167
# Her old man took
her diamonds #

01:18:43.279 --> 01:18:47.739
# And tiaras by the score #

01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:51.911
# Now she gets her kicks
in Stepney #

01:18:52.021 --> 01:18:56.481
# Not in Knightsbridge anymore #

01:18:56.592 --> 01:19:00.289
# So don't you play with me #

01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:02.887
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

01:19:05.501 --> 01:19:09.130
# So don't you play with me #

01:19:09.238 --> 01:19:12.230
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

01:19:14.343 --> 01:19:17.904
# So don't you play with me #

01:19:18.013 --> 01:19:21.210
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire. #

01:19:21.317 --> 01:19:23.012
All right, let's make an agreement.

01:19:23.118 --> 01:19:25.313
A: We'll get an early start
tomorrow morning

01:19:25.421 --> 01:19:27.548
and try to enjoy
each other's company here

01:19:27.656 --> 01:19:29.180
in this beautiful place.

01:19:29.291 --> 01:19:31.623
B: We'll stop feeling sorry
for ourselves.

01:19:31.727 --> 01:19:33.319
It's not very attractive.

01:19:33.429 --> 01:19:35.727
C: We'll make our plans
for the future.

01:19:35.831 --> 01:19:36.798
Can we agree to that?

01:19:36.899 --> 01:19:38.127
- Sure.
- Yeah. - Okay.

01:19:43.238 --> 01:19:44.762
To be continued.

01:20:05.394 --> 01:20:06.759
Good morning.

01:20:06.862 --> 01:20:08.591
She's gone.

01:20:08.697 --> 01:20:10.028
What?

01:20:10.132 --> 01:20:11.759
She's gone.

01:20:11.867 --> 01:20:14.427
I was still asleep,
but Oberoi saw her go.

01:20:17.539 --> 01:20:18.767
Peter.

01:20:18.874 --> 01:20:19.966
What?

01:20:20.075 --> 01:20:21.269
She's gone.

01:20:21.377 --> 01:20:22.844
Who?

01:20:25.614 --> 01:20:28.139
She's gone?

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:29.615
Where?

01:20:29.718 --> 01:20:31.117
They couldn't say.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.245
They just said she
goes away sometimes.

01:20:33.355 --> 01:20:35.755
She left our breakfast
in the doorway.

01:21:46.728 --> 01:21:48.286
Whoo!

01:21:56.071 --> 01:21:57.538
Zip!

01:22:07.015 --> 01:22:08.482
Pshew!

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:54.187
I'm working on a new short story.

01:22:54.296 --> 01:22:56.628
I wrote the ending, but I
don't know how it starts.

01:22:56.732 --> 01:22:58.199
Read us what you got.

01:22:59.568 --> 01:23:01.502
"'Whatever happens
in the end,' she said,

01:23:01.603 --> 01:23:03.628
"'I don't want to lose
you as my friend.'

01:23:03.739 --> 01:23:04.763
"He looked into her eyes.

01:23:04.873 --> 01:23:06.397
"'I promise I will never
be your friend,

01:23:06.508 --> 01:23:08.169
"no matter what, ever.'

01:23:08.277 --> 01:23:09.574
"Her voice cracked.

01:23:09.678 --> 01:23:11.475
"'If we fuck, I'm gonna
feel like shit tomorrow.'

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:12.842
"'That's okay with me,' he said.

01:23:12.948 --> 01:23:14.472
"He lifted her shirt over her head.

01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:15.982
"'I love you,' she said.

01:23:16.084 --> 01:23:17.517
"'I never hurt you on purpose.'

01:23:17.619 --> 01:23:18.984
"He nodded.
'I don't care.'

01:23:19.087 --> 01:23:22.056
He would not be going to Italy."

01:23:22.157 --> 01:23:23.647
That sound okay?

01:23:23.759 --> 01:23:26.227
Yeah. It's hard for me
to judge the ending

01:23:26.328 --> 01:23:28.057
without knowing the rest of it.

01:23:28.163 --> 01:23:29.892
I like how mean you are.

01:23:29.998 --> 01:23:31.829
Well, the characters are all...

01:23:33.335 --> 01:23:34.962
Thanks.

01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:42.877
That's our train.

01:23:52.187 --> 01:23:53.654
Hurry!

01:23:57.559 --> 01:24:00.687
Dad's bags aren't gonna make it!

01:24:06.902 --> 01:24:08.870
# I know a man,
he's a powerful man #

01:24:08.971 --> 01:24:11.838
# Got the people in his power
in the palm of his hand #

01:24:16.712 --> 01:24:19.272
# He started at the bottom
and he worked his way up #

01:24:19.381 --> 01:24:21.815
# Now he's never gonna stop
until he reaches the top #

01:24:26.188 --> 01:24:29.453
# It's the same old story #

01:24:33.028 --> 01:24:35.963
# It's the same old dream #

01:24:36.064 --> 01:24:41.161
# It's power, man, power, man,
and all that it can bring #

01:24:44.006 --> 01:24:46.372
# If you want your money,
better stand in the line #

01:24:46.475 --> 01:24:48.238
# But you'll only end up
picking up #

01:24:48.343 --> 01:24:50.311
#The nickels and dimes. #

01:25:05.327 --> 01:25:06.726
Good morning. Whitman?

01:25:06.828 --> 01:25:07.886
Uh-huh.

01:25:07.996 --> 01:25:09.463
May I see your ticket,
please?

01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:15.932
Welcome aboard.

01:25:16.038 --> 01:25:16.936
Thank you.

01:25:17.039 --> 01:25:18.006
Thank you.

01:25:18.106 --> 01:25:19.596
Sweet lime?

01:25:21.343 --> 01:25:22.810
Why not?

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.429
Why don't you hang onto mine?

01:25:50.005 --> 01:25:52.098
It's safer if you keep them.

01:26:07.823 --> 01:26:10.223
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

01:26:10.325 --> 01:26:14.159
# Je m'baladais sur l'avenue
le coeur ouvert à l'inconnu #

01:26:14.262 --> 01:26:18.426
# J'avais envie de dire bonjour
à n'importe qui #

01:26:18.533 --> 01:26:22.731
# N'importe qui et ce fut toi,
je t'ai dit n'importe quoi #

01:26:22.838 --> 01:26:27.070
# Il suffisait de te parler,
pour t'apprivoiser #

01:26:27.175 --> 01:26:35.844
# Aux Champs-Elysées,
aux Champs-Elysées #

01:26:35.951 --> 01:26:40.149
# Au soleil, sous la pluie,
à midi ou à minuit #

01:26:40.255 --> 01:26:44.351
# Il y a tout ce que vous
voulez aux Champs-Elysées #

01:26:44.459 --> 01:26:48.418
# Tu m'as dit "J'ai rendez-vous
dans un sous-sol avec des fous #

01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:52.796
# Qui vivent la guitare
à la main, du soir au matin" #

01:26:52.901 --> 01:26:57.065
# Alors je t'ai accompagnée,
on a chanté, on a dansé #

01:26:57.172 --> 01:27:01.541
# Et l'on n'a même
pas pensé à s'embrasser #

01:27:01.643 --> 01:27:10.073
# Aux Champs-Elysées,
aux Champs-Elysées #

01:27:10.185 --> 01:27:14.281
# Au soleil, sous la pluie,
à midi ou à minuit #

01:27:14.389 --> 01:27:18.655
# Il y a tout ce quevous
voulez aux Champs-Elysées #

01:27:36.011 --> 01:27:40.038
# Hier soir deux inconnus
et ce matin sur l'avenue #

01:27:40.148 --> 01:27:44.209
# Deux amoureux tout étourdis
par la longue nuit #

01:27:44.319 --> 01:27:48.653
# Et de l'Étoile à la Concorde,
un orchestre à mille cordes #

01:27:48.757 --> 01:27:53.353
# Tous les oiseaux du point
du jour chantent l'amour #

01:27:53.462 --> 01:28:01.801
# Aux Champs-Elysées,
aux Champs-Elysées #

01:28:01.903 --> 01:28:05.964
# Au soleil, sous la pluie,
à midi ou à minuit #

01:28:06.074 --> 01:28:10.374
# Il y a tout ce quevous
voulez aux Champs-Elysées #

01:28:10.479 --> 01:28:18.978
# Aux Champs-Elysées,
aux Champs-Elysées #

01:28:19.087 --> 01:28:23.353
# Au soleil, sous la pluie,
à midi ou à minuit #

01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:27.792
# Il y a tout ce quevous
voulez aux Champs-Elysées #

01:28:27.896 --> 01:28:35.599
# Aux Champs-Elysées,
aux Champs-Elysées... #

01:31:21.858 --> 01:31:24.358
