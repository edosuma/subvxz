00:00.050 --> 00:01.986
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

00:01.987 --> 00:03.737
There is something
about this gem that is

00:03.738 --> 00:05.705
definitely connected
to you, Catherine.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.614
Look who was helping
Scotland Yard.

00:07.615 --> 00:10.623
Rebecca Reynolds. You think
I'm related to this woman?

00:10.624 --> 00:12.925
Turns out that my relative
Rebecca Reynolds

00:12.959 --> 00:16.661
was investigating a string of
murders that look like maulings.

00:16.696 --> 00:19.731
Rebecca Reynolds' journal.
It's all about she feels like

00:19.765 --> 00:22.400
she has to kill her beast.
Her beast. Alistair. Really?

00:22.435 --> 00:23.969
It was a long time ago.

00:24.003 --> 00:26.305
- It's a beast collar.
- A collar?

00:26.339 --> 00:29.241
Which implies somebody
was controlling it.

00:29.275 --> 00:32.143
Why would someone want a gem
that controls beasts?

00:32.177 --> 00:34.078
Evening, Specialist Keller.

00:34.112 --> 00:35.847
I'm Agent Thomas,
this is Agent Barnett.

00:35.881 --> 00:37.114
Knox wants to do some tests.

00:37.149 --> 00:38.182
<i>We work for the government.</i>

00:38.217 --> 00:39.751
We are the good guys.

00:39.785 --> 00:40.785
Congratulations. You've been

00:40.820 --> 00:42.420
exonerated of all charges.

00:42.455 --> 00:44.689
It wasn't me who did it.
Well, who was it?

00:44.724 --> 00:48.192
Obviously they didn't
want us to find them.

00:48.227 --> 00:49.360
It's over now.

00:49.394 --> 00:50.627
Vincent's been exonerated.

00:50.662 --> 00:52.029
And if you try to expose him,

00:52.064 --> 00:54.798
I will expose everything
that you have done.

00:54.833 --> 00:57.634
There was a time when you were
a man who wanted to save people.

00:57.669 --> 01:00.238
I was hoping to find that
man again, but he's gone.

01:06.378 --> 01:08.311
None of this is real. I don't
believe Vincent's a beast.

01:08.346 --> 01:09.513
Or that they even exist.

01:17.221 --> 01:18.856
Look down there!

01:20.224 --> 01:21.657
We must find the beast!

01:21.692 --> 01:22.725
Hunt him down!

01:22.760 --> 01:24.159
Check every door!

01:24.194 --> 01:25.995
Leave no stone unturned!

01:26.029 --> 01:28.163
Hurry, hurry, this way!

01:28.198 --> 01:30.466
We must find this beast!

01:30.501 --> 01:31.534
Hurry, hurry!

01:39.542 --> 01:41.510
Check down here,
check every door!

01:41.544 --> 01:43.078
Women and children stay indoors.

01:43.113 --> 01:44.179
Lock yourselves indoors.

01:44.214 --> 01:45.314
Look down there!

01:45.348 --> 01:46.515
Hey!

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.760 --> 02:00.562
Are you hurt?

02:00.596 --> 02:02.898
Are you following me,
Miss Reynolds?

02:02.932 --> 02:04.699
You can thank me later.

02:04.734 --> 02:05.734
This way.

02:05.735 --> 02:06.935
Hurry.

02:06.969 --> 02:08.336
Back that way.

02:08.370 --> 02:09.738
Come on, men,
follow me.

02:09.771 --> 02:10.939
Down this alley,
down this alley.

02:10.973 --> 02:13.441
Rebecca! Rebecca, wait!

02:13.475 --> 02:14.742
Listen to me.

02:14.776 --> 02:17.045
You have got to let
me go after him.

02:17.079 --> 02:19.447
He wants you to go after him,
you know that.

02:19.481 --> 02:20.949
He's a beast now, Alistair.

02:20.983 --> 02:22.423
All he cares about
is destroying you.

02:22.451 --> 02:24.085
Which is why I must
kill him first.

02:28.222 --> 02:30.290
Now, that is not fair.

02:30.325 --> 02:31.926
Desperate women do
desperate things.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.060
Rebecca, listen to me.

02:33.094 --> 02:34.895
He is killing
innocent people

02:34.930 --> 02:36.697
and making it look
like I'm doing it.

02:36.731 --> 02:37.765
It's because all
he cares about

02:37.799 --> 02:38.799
is destroying you,

02:38.800 --> 02:40.400
exposing you, killing you.

02:40.435 --> 02:42.536
I promise you I will
not let that happen.

02:42.571 --> 02:45.638
Only if you don't fall
into his trap.

02:45.673 --> 02:47.007
Only if we do this together.

02:48.409 --> 02:50.277
Please, Alistair.

02:50.311 --> 02:52.412
I can't bear to lose you again.

02:57.485 --> 02:59.252
There he is!

02:59.287 --> 03:00.419
Watch out!

03:00.454 --> 03:01.788
What happened?

03:01.822 --> 03:03.222
What's the matter?

03:03.256 --> 03:05.124
I don't know.

03:06.660 --> 03:07.760
Okay,

03:07.795 --> 03:09.496
I am taking this away from you.

03:09.530 --> 03:11.731
No. I am reading it.
Come on. You're obsessed.

03:11.765 --> 03:13.132
It's just a journal.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.101
My ancestor's journal.
Rebecca's.

03:15.135 --> 03:16.802
And the more I read it,

03:16.836 --> 03:18.504
the more I realize that

03:18.538 --> 03:21.107
what we went through is
exactly what she did.

03:21.141 --> 03:22.141
Mm-hmm.

03:23.276 --> 03:24.310
So?

03:24.344 --> 03:25.644
So, someone was trying

03:25.678 --> 03:27.079
to destroy her Vincent, too.

03:27.114 --> 03:28.314
Just like Gabe.

03:28.348 --> 03:29.748
Catherine,

03:29.782 --> 03:32.084
Gabe is no longer
a threat. Okay?

03:32.119 --> 03:33.619
We took care of that,
remember?

03:33.653 --> 03:35.153
Are you sure?

03:35.187 --> 03:37.022
Because she thought that
they had dealt with their

03:37.056 --> 03:37.642
threat, too, and...

03:37.666 --> 03:39.658
All right, just because
this Rebecca

03:39.659 --> 03:41.326
is going through something
similar to us

03:41.360 --> 03:44.195
does not mean that it is
happening to us, okay?

03:44.230 --> 03:47.165
This is in the past,
and right now all I care about

03:47.199 --> 03:50.335
is the future. Our future.

03:54.340 --> 03:55.507
Over easy?

03:55.541 --> 03:56.807
Sorry?
- Your eggs.

03:56.842 --> 03:58.276
How do you like them?

03:58.310 --> 04:00.978
Okay, wait.

04:01.013 --> 04:03.948
To be clear,
this is the same Rebecca

04:03.982 --> 04:06.651
that killed Alistair, her love.

04:06.685 --> 04:08.452
Doesn't that bother you at all?

04:08.486 --> 04:10.855
Well, hopefully it wasn't
because he burned her eggs.

04:10.889 --> 04:12.723
Vincent, I'm being serious.

04:12.758 --> 04:14.859
Catherine, it's a journal,
all right?

04:14.893 --> 04:17.127
It's for recording thoughts,
not facts.

04:17.161 --> 04:19.630
You have no idea

04:19.665 --> 04:21.165
why Rebecca killed him,
or frankly

04:21.199 --> 04:22.866
even if she really did.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.335
Why would she write it down
if it wasn't true?

04:25.370 --> 04:27.371
And why would she kill
the love of her life

04:27.405 --> 04:30.207
after doing everything possible
to save him?

04:30.241 --> 04:32.476
You know what I think?
What?

04:32.510 --> 04:33.710
I think you're
so used to looking

04:33.744 --> 04:35.145
for something to worry about.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.814
All right, come here.

04:37.848 --> 04:40.316
Look, listen to me.
It's over, okay?

04:40.350 --> 04:44.087
The manhunt, the exposure,
Gabe-- it is all behind us.

04:44.121 --> 04:46.856
Which means whatever threat
these two people,

04:46.891 --> 04:49.492
Rebecca and Alistair,
were facing over 200 years ago,

04:49.526 --> 04:52.929
it has absolutely no connection
to us whatsoever, okay?

04:52.964 --> 04:54.363
We're free.

04:54.398 --> 04:55.931
You have nothing to worry about

04:55.966 --> 04:59.068
because there is
no one after me anymore.

05:07.811 --> 05:10.713
Don't you two answer
your damn phones?

05:10.747 --> 05:12.781
<i>Are you sure he's a beast?</i>

05:12.816 --> 05:15.183
Did you see him beast out?
Cat, I think I know what

05:15.218 --> 05:17.285
a beast looks like by now.
It just doesn't make sense.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.254
The last thing Gabe would want
is to become a beast again.

05:19.288 --> 05:20.555
Yeah, well, I guess
he's got nothing

05:20.590 --> 05:22.357
to lose now and
blames me for it.

05:22.391 --> 05:24.559
Why else would he become a beast
and kill this Beth girl?

05:24.594 --> 05:26.361
Because he wants us
to think you did it.

05:26.395 --> 05:28.130
I'm gonna kill him.

05:28.164 --> 05:30.398
Vincent, you can't.
Catherine, if Gabe is a beast,

05:30.433 --> 05:32.267
he's gonna be out
for blood, my blood,

05:32.301 --> 05:33.935
and I'm the only one
who can stop him, right?

05:33.969 --> 05:36.070
If you're lucky.
What's that supposed to mean?

05:36.105 --> 05:38.706
It means Gabe's different than
he was before, he can blur now.

05:38.741 --> 05:39.907
What?

05:39.942 --> 05:41.075
He used the serum

05:41.110 --> 05:42.377
Sam made me make,
the one that had

05:42.411 --> 05:44.779
Tori's blood in it--
proto-beast DNA.

05:44.813 --> 05:46.714
Gabe was pretty badass before,

05:46.749 --> 05:48.883
but who knows how much
more powerful he is now?

05:50.853 --> 05:53.420
All right,
this hasn't gone wide yet.

05:53.455 --> 05:55.389
But it's only a matter of time
before the media finds out,

05:55.423 --> 05:57.759
especially since Beth
was one of their own.

05:57.793 --> 05:59.994
Oh, my God, Beth.

06:00.029 --> 06:01.795
The bastard ripped
her heart out.

06:01.829 --> 06:05.499
I don't believe this.

06:05.534 --> 06:07.568
He really wants people
to be afraid of me,

06:07.602 --> 06:10.304
think whatever she was gonna
write about me to be true.

06:10.338 --> 06:12.406
What? To incite a mob?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.775
No, to destroy me.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.621
Vincent?

06:30.158 --> 06:31.291
No, no, look,
we got this, okay?

06:31.325 --> 06:32.659
Just go back to your little lab,

06:32.694 --> 06:33.860
find out how powerful
Gabe really is

06:33.895 --> 06:35.361
so we know what
we're up against.

06:35.396 --> 06:38.130
"Little lab"?
You know what I mean.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.267
Hey, what's Vincent Keller doing here?
Are you a suspect?

06:41.302 --> 06:42.912
Are the police bringing you in?

06:42.936 --> 06:43.869
Was her heart really
ripped out of her chest?

06:43.870 --> 06:46.372
Isn't that how Curt Windsor was murdered?
Okay, let us through.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.973
Where was Alistair
the night of the murder?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.509
What kind of monster would
kill someone like that?

06:49.543 --> 06:50.943
Are you protecting
Mr. Keller, Detective?

06:50.977 --> 06:52.444
Is it true you're
in love with him?

06:52.478 --> 06:53.846
Are you in love
with Alistair, Miss Reynolds?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.547
Get out of the way!
Alistair, no, wait!

06:55.582 --> 06:57.116
Vincent, wait.
Wait for what?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.670
They already think
I'm guilty, which is

06:58.685 --> 07:00.125
what Gabe wants them
to think, right?

07:00.153 --> 07:01.687
No, he wants you
to go after him.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.155
Kill or be killed.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.990
Yeah, well, I'll
take my chances.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.792
Yeah, but I won't.
You're playing

07:06.827 --> 07:08.393
right into his hands.
Don't you see?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.662
Just like Rebecca worried
Alistair was doing.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.031
He wants you to lose control.
He wants you to beast out.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.866
Okay, guys, I don't mean to be
the voice of doom here,

07:14.900 --> 07:16.535
but we need a plan.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.837
How about I call
our guardian angel at the FBI?

07:18.871 --> 07:21.231
See if Agent Knox can keep this
from getting out of control.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.575
Okay.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.743
Okay, I'm gonna head
back to the precinct.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.910
I'll try to slow down

07:25.945 --> 07:28.579
the investigation,
buy us some time.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.251
Aah! Please!

07:33.285 --> 07:35.086
Please don't kill me!

07:35.121 --> 07:36.420
Please.
Agent Knox?

07:36.455 --> 07:38.022
Can you hear me?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.294
Knox! Agent Knox?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.313
Gabe?

08:16.027 --> 08:17.705
Where are you going?
Where do you think?

08:17.797 --> 08:19.031
No, you can't kill Gabe.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.199
We've already had
this conversation.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.567
Catherine, he killed
your friend.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.801
And now he's killed
our only ally.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.269
Okay? This has to stop.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.871
Yes, and we will stop him,
I promise.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.906
But not this way,
not your way.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.207
You know any other way
to kill a beast?

08:29.241 --> 08:30.241
We will figure it out.

08:30.242 --> 08:31.643
Vincent, I despise Gabe for what

08:31.678 --> 08:33.311
he's done, and I want
to kill him, too,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.614
but I can't and neither
can you because it's wrong.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.215
And what Gabe's doing isn't?

08:37.249 --> 08:38.950
No, of course it is,
you know it is.

08:38.985 --> 08:41.785
But you can't go back to being
judge, jury and executioner.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.254
I can't just let him
kill innocent people

08:43.289 --> 08:44.322
to get to me, either, okay?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.691
This stops right now.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.964
Forbes.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.431
Change of plan.

08:54.466 --> 08:56.100
Cat just called.
We've got to find Vincent.

08:56.134 --> 08:58.135
Vincent, what do you mean?
What happened?

08:58.169 --> 08:59.637
What happened is
that Gabe killed Agent Knox,

08:59.671 --> 09:01.472
and now Vincent's looking
to kill Gabe.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.273
Knox?! Holy crap!

09:03.308 --> 09:05.175
Gabe's gone nuts.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.811
Yeah, well, apparently
so has Vincent, and Cat couldn't

09:06.845 --> 09:09.413
stop him from going after Gabe,
so she needs us to.

09:09.447 --> 09:12.682
More than she realizes.
What does that mean?

09:12.717 --> 09:15.319
It means I ran some
calculations, factored in

09:15.353 --> 09:18.655
the mutated, cross-species DNA
Gabe injected himself with...

09:18.689 --> 09:21.325
Okay, never mind all that, JT.
Just tell me what it means.

09:21.359 --> 09:23.360
It means Gabe'll kick
Vincent's ass, okay?

09:23.395 --> 09:25.795
It means
if we don't stop Vincent

09:25.830 --> 09:28.297
before he finds Gabe,
Gabe will kill him.

09:28.332 --> 09:30.534
All right,
how fast can you tap into

09:30.568 --> 09:32.135
the city's surveillance cameras?

09:32.169 --> 09:34.170
Hopefully fast enough
to find Vincent.

09:34.204 --> 09:36.006
All right, I'm on my way.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.340
Here?

09:37.374 --> 09:39.142
Okay, good, um,

09:39.176 --> 09:41.011
maybe we can talk about us.

09:42.079 --> 09:44.013
Hello?

09:50.087 --> 09:52.121
<i>There's got to be</i>
<i>another way to stop a beast.</i>

09:52.156 --> 09:53.722
I mean, I know
that the gem and the collar,

09:53.757 --> 09:55.358
they stop their powers...
You'll never get it

09:55.392 --> 09:56.792
around Gabe's neck.
Vincent's the only one

09:56.826 --> 09:58.461
who can get close enough
to even try.

09:58.495 --> 09:59.628
I mean, without
Vincent's help.

09:59.663 --> 10:00.963
Well, then no way.

10:00.997 --> 10:02.164
If everything
you told me

10:02.198 --> 10:03.365
about Gabe is true.
If I don't find

10:03.399 --> 10:05.034
a way to stop Gabe
before Vincent does...

10:05.068 --> 10:07.135
You are gonna lose
Vincent either way.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.138
Even if he defeats Gabe,
I've told you this before,

10:10.173 --> 10:11.807
beasts only get worse.

10:11.841 --> 10:13.208
But that's not true.

10:13.242 --> 10:14.910
It is, Catherine.

10:14.945 --> 10:16.811
Then how do you
explain Vincent?

10:18.114 --> 10:19.747
He's not worse,
he's better.

10:19.782 --> 10:21.183
We're better.

10:21.217 --> 10:23.418
I know.

10:23.453 --> 10:25.253
Ah, it doesn't
make any sense.

10:25.288 --> 10:27.689
All I've ever seen is
that sooner or later,

10:27.723 --> 10:29.191
they all turn into, to...

10:29.225 --> 10:30.658
to monsters.

10:30.693 --> 10:33.027
I don't know, maybe,
maybe Vincent's different.

10:33.062 --> 10:34.495
Maybe...

10:34.529 --> 10:38.165
maybe you made Vincent
different by loving him.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.501
Give me a break.

10:40.535 --> 10:41.903
No. What else
could it be?

10:41.937 --> 10:44.271
It's the same thing
Rebecca did for Alistair

10:44.306 --> 10:45.506
all those years ago.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.008
By all accounts,
Alistair was good.

10:47.042 --> 10:49.376
He did good things,
he helped people like Vincent.

10:49.411 --> 10:50.677
Still, the public

10:50.712 --> 10:52.346
was afraid of him,
afraid of what he was.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.047
And it's
no different today.

10:54.082 --> 10:55.082
Okay, fine.

10:55.117 --> 10:56.717
But how does that
help me now?

10:56.751 --> 10:58.219
And what did you mean

10:58.253 --> 11:00.588
when you said that I would
lose Vincent either way?

11:00.622 --> 11:04.024
'Cause there's a point of no
return for beasts, Catherine.

11:04.058 --> 11:05.526
And maybe Vincent's
different in that, too,

11:05.560 --> 11:06.760
but I doubt it.

11:06.794 --> 11:08.095
If Gabe has
crossed that line,

11:08.129 --> 11:09.262
lost all sense
of morality,

11:09.296 --> 11:10.363
then the only way

11:10.397 --> 11:11.698
that Vincent can stop him

11:11.733 --> 11:13.266
is by crossing
that line himself.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.901
And lose his humanity.

11:18.773 --> 11:20.741
What am I gonna do?

11:20.775 --> 11:22.675
I don't know.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.749
Okay, m-maybe, uh...

11:29.783 --> 11:31.751
maybe you can
capture Gabe.

11:31.785 --> 11:34.254
The way I captured Vincent
last year; you trap him.

11:34.288 --> 11:37.123
But whatever you do,
if you want to save Vincent...

11:37.158 --> 11:39.959
you keep him away
from Gabe at all costs.

11:43.664 --> 11:44.764
The beast has killed again!

11:44.798 --> 11:45.898
Find the beast!

11:45.932 --> 11:47.432
This way, men, this way!

11:47.467 --> 11:48.467
Make him pay!

11:55.808 --> 11:56.808
You want me, beast?

11:58.645 --> 12:01.146
You got me.

12:20.066 --> 12:21.332
Die!

12:25.871 --> 12:27.572
Alistair!

12:30.008 --> 12:32.109
What's taking so long?

12:32.143 --> 12:33.477
So long? Last time we tried
looking for Vincent,

12:33.512 --> 12:35.446
it took us three months,
remember?

12:35.480 --> 12:36.880
Yeah, but Cat's
freaking, all right?

12:36.915 --> 12:38.316
You know, she says
if we don't find Vincent

12:38.350 --> 12:40.284
and stop him before he finds...
- Gabe!

12:40.319 --> 12:41.885
No. Yoko Ono.
Of course I mean Gabe.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.688
No. I mean, I found Gabe.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.689
Look... camera says Broadway

12:45.724 --> 12:47.357
and Chatham;
that's Chinatown.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.828
Looks like he's just
sitting there, waiting.

12:50.862 --> 12:53.130
Yeah. For Vincent.

12:58.870 --> 13:00.037
Hey, Cat?

13:12.383 --> 13:14.684
I'm actually a little
disappointed in you, Vincent.

13:14.719 --> 13:18.420
I expected you to come look
for me much earlier.

13:18.455 --> 13:21.224
And definitely before
I killed your friend.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.659
Knox, right?

13:23.693 --> 13:27.263
Your heart's racing.

13:27.297 --> 13:28.430
You want to kill me

13:28.465 --> 13:30.266
and I want you to... try.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.334
See, I had to become
like this again...

13:32.369 --> 13:34.503
a beast.
To stop you.

13:34.537 --> 13:36.538
To protect Catherine...
from you...

13:36.573 --> 13:37.573
once and for all.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.743
I can tell you're close.

13:40.777 --> 13:42.210
What are you waiting for?

13:42.245 --> 13:43.345
You afraid of me?

13:43.380 --> 13:46.382
Afraid you can't defeat me?

13:46.416 --> 13:48.617
'Cause I will just keep killing

13:48.652 --> 13:49.951
those who matter most to you

13:49.986 --> 13:51.186
until you try.

13:59.395 --> 14:00.762
Hey.

14:10.172 --> 14:11.272
Hurry!

14:18.947 --> 14:20.548
Go. Go.
Get out of here!

14:24.089 --> 14:25.922
Still don't see
how using Vincent's blood

14:25.947 --> 14:26.913
to lure Gabe is
going to work.

14:26.948 --> 14:28.549
Don't ask me. Ask Cat.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.884
- Love to. Where is she?
- Sorry.

14:30.918 --> 14:32.553
Sorry. I thought I'd lost it,
but fortunately

14:32.587 --> 14:33.621
it was just under
the passenger seat.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.088
Yeah, fortunately.

14:35.123 --> 14:36.257
Look, I'm sorry,
but what does that journal

14:36.291 --> 14:37.590
have to do with anything?

14:37.625 --> 14:39.760
Everything that
we're going through

14:39.794 --> 14:41.427
happened to Rebecca
and Alistair, too.

14:41.462 --> 14:42.929
- It's eerie.
- And...

14:42.964 --> 14:44.397
hard to believe.
- Okay.

14:44.431 --> 14:46.733
Mock me all you want,
but I'm telling you,

14:46.768 --> 14:48.068
history is repeating itself.

14:48.102 --> 14:51.138
If I could see how Rebecca
protected Alistair

14:51.172 --> 14:52.405
from their beast,
maybe I could figure out

14:52.439 --> 14:53.906
how to protect Vincent
from Gabe.

14:53.940 --> 14:56.376
And then somehow
capture Gabe

14:56.410 --> 14:58.411
without Vincent's help?
Gabe saw you.

14:58.445 --> 14:59.879
He knows we're
protecting Vincent now.

14:59.913 --> 15:01.581
If Gabe wants to
get Vincent,

15:01.615 --> 15:02.882
he's gonna have to track him.

15:02.916 --> 15:04.484
And Vincent's blood--

15:04.518 --> 15:05.918
it's gonna lead him
right into our trap.

15:05.952 --> 15:07.587
Did you talk to
Captain Ward?

15:07.621 --> 15:10.056
Yeah, he's on board
but barely.

15:10.090 --> 15:11.791
I mean, he's agreed to have
SWAT ready and waiting.

15:11.825 --> 15:13.559
But if we can't prove that
Gabe's the real killer,

15:13.593 --> 15:14.626
he's coming after Vincent.
- Okay,

15:14.661 --> 15:16.095
then we'd better
have everything

15:16.129 --> 15:17.963
that we need on Gabe.

15:17.998 --> 15:19.999
How much evidence
do you want me to put together?

15:20.033 --> 15:22.334
I mean, uh, I could show how
Gabe experimented on himself,

15:22.368 --> 15:24.269
corrupted his own DNA;

15:24.304 --> 15:26.072
that will connect him
to the murders.

15:26.106 --> 15:27.439
But do you really want me

15:27.473 --> 15:28.840
to include Muirfield, too?

15:28.874 --> 15:30.609
No. No. I don't want anything

15:30.643 --> 15:32.010
that could possibly
lead this to Vincent.

15:32.044 --> 15:33.412
If this works,

15:33.446 --> 15:34.846
the public needs to think

15:34.880 --> 15:36.348
that everything begins
and ends with Gabe.

15:36.382 --> 15:39.585
First, I need to figure out
how to protect Vincent.

15:46.325 --> 15:48.059
Alistair!

15:50.295 --> 15:52.663
Over there!

15:52.698 --> 15:53.932
<i>Over here, I found something!</i>

15:53.966 --> 15:55.767
What is it?
What have you found?

15:55.801 --> 15:57.168
Blood.

15:57.203 --> 16:00.638
I think he fell
from the catwalk.

16:00.672 --> 16:02.473
There's more blood
over here.

16:02.507 --> 16:04.174
This way!

16:04.209 --> 16:06.176
Follow the blood!

16:06.211 --> 16:07.678
This way!

16:10.249 --> 16:13.484
I just need to rest a minute.

16:13.518 --> 16:15.386
No. You need
more than that.

16:21.092 --> 16:22.893
Is that your best
bedside manner?

16:22.927 --> 16:23.927
Serves you right.

16:23.928 --> 16:25.495
I told you not to go after him.

16:25.529 --> 16:26.830
I had him.

16:26.865 --> 16:28.198
I just...

16:28.233 --> 16:30.134
...slipped.

16:30.168 --> 16:32.535
No, Alistair.
You almost died.

16:32.570 --> 16:35.805
I can't keep letting him kill
innocent people to get to me.

16:35.839 --> 16:37.507
Even if you could
stop him,

16:37.541 --> 16:39.842
it would not stop
the entire city from thinking

16:39.877 --> 16:41.478
that <i>you</i> are the monster,
not him.

16:41.512 --> 16:42.912
I still have to try.

16:42.946 --> 16:45.415
- No. You will stay right here.

16:45.449 --> 16:46.983
I told you, Alistair,

16:47.017 --> 16:48.885
I will not lose you again.

16:48.919 --> 16:51.687
Rebecca, please.

16:51.721 --> 16:53.189
This is not just
happening to you,

16:53.223 --> 16:56.259
this is also
happening to me.

16:56.293 --> 17:00.763
Perhaps it is <i>my</i> destiny
to kill this beast.

17:00.798 --> 17:02.398
No.

17:02.432 --> 17:06.233
Rebecca, what are you saying?

17:06.269 --> 17:08.671
Rebecca, what are you doing?

17:08.704 --> 17:10.105
Protecting you.

17:10.138 --> 17:11.740
No.

17:13.609 --> 17:16.243
Rebecca, wait!

17:16.279 --> 17:18.414
Rebecca!

17:18.448 --> 17:21.215
Rebecca, you have no idea
what you're doing!

17:21.250 --> 17:23.417
Rebecca!

17:27.489 --> 17:28.824
<i>Rebecca!</i>

17:31.127 --> 17:32.794
Do you want
the beast collar, too?

17:32.829 --> 17:33.862
No. Just the gem.

17:33.896 --> 17:35.430
Thank you.

17:35.464 --> 17:37.199
Vincent is not going
to like this.

17:37.233 --> 17:38.800
Well, it's better him alive
and mad at me

17:38.834 --> 17:40.201
than dead and not care.

17:40.235 --> 17:41.569
Where are the vials?
Of Vincent's blood?

17:41.603 --> 17:44.605
Desk.
- Tess, can you grab those?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.307
Okay. Make as many
tranq darts as you can.

17:46.342 --> 17:47.608
Get them over
to the precinct,

17:47.643 --> 17:49.477
then get back to work
on the evidence.

17:49.511 --> 17:51.813
Because if we can deliver
Gabe to Captain Ward,

17:51.847 --> 17:53.314
he's gonna want the
evidence there, too.

17:53.349 --> 17:55.049
Otherwise, it's our word
against Gabe's. Got it?

17:55.083 --> 17:56.951
Got it.

17:56.985 --> 17:59.753
Hey.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.422
Be careful. Okay?

18:02.457 --> 18:04.124
Don't worry about me.

18:04.159 --> 18:05.159
I don't have a choice.

18:07.162 --> 18:08.295
Let's go.

18:13.534 --> 18:15.802
You sure you know
what you're doing?

18:15.837 --> 18:16.837
No.

18:16.838 --> 18:18.004
But what choice do I have?

18:18.038 --> 18:19.639
I can't lose Vincent.

18:19.674 --> 18:21.408
I get that, Cat, but I don't
want to lose you either.

18:21.442 --> 18:23.276
And you're taking a huge risk
going after Gabe by yourself.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.678
No. I'm not going
after him by myself.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.247
I'm just leading him
into a trap, that's all.

18:27.281 --> 18:28.314
But, Cat, you're leaving
blood crumbs

18:28.349 --> 18:29.349
all over the city, really?

18:29.383 --> 18:31.517
Come on, that's about
as crazy as it gets,

18:31.551 --> 18:33.119
and... considering all the
crazy crap we've done,

18:33.153 --> 18:35.188
that's saying something.
Believe me, I know.

18:35.222 --> 18:36.589
But if I'm gonna
save Vincent,

18:36.623 --> 18:37.790
this is what
I have to do.

18:37.824 --> 18:39.859
Who says-- Rebecca?

18:39.894 --> 18:40.994
I mean, come on,

18:41.028 --> 18:42.195
aren't you banking a lot
on this journal?

18:42.229 --> 18:43.963
Isn't that the
same journal that said

18:43.998 --> 18:45.531
she killed her Vincent?
Really?

18:45.565 --> 18:47.032
I don't know
what happened or why.

18:47.066 --> 18:49.334
It doesn't make sense,
but I'm not doing this

18:49.369 --> 18:51.036
because of the journal,
I'm doing this because

18:51.070 --> 18:53.205
what does make sense is
protecting Vincent from Gabe.

18:53.239 --> 18:55.508
And that's all
that matters to me.

19:23.168 --> 19:25.236
I got to stop Gabe now.

19:25.270 --> 19:26.871
No. You don't.

19:26.906 --> 19:28.339
You're gonna
stay right here.

19:28.373 --> 19:30.007
You're safer here.
-  Here. Where?

19:30.042 --> 19:31.142
I mean, come on...

19:31.176 --> 19:32.376
I, I got to stop him.

19:32.411 --> 19:34.345
No. Stop worrying about Gabe.

19:34.379 --> 19:36.047
I will take care of him.
I have a plan, okay?

19:36.081 --> 19:39.016
A plan, really? What plan?

19:39.051 --> 19:40.531
What, what-what are you
talking about?

19:40.552 --> 19:42.420
- Vincent, I don't want to lose you.

19:42.454 --> 19:43.754
You know that.

19:43.788 --> 19:45.222
You just need
to trust me.

19:46.724 --> 19:49.760
This is my destiny, too.

19:51.529 --> 19:53.997
Catherine, Catherine.

19:54.031 --> 19:56.399
Cat, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

20:00.404 --> 20:02.773
Protecting you.

20:02.807 --> 20:04.508
No, wait, come on.
Catherine, stop.

20:04.542 --> 20:05.909
Catherine, come on!

20:05.944 --> 20:08.544
Rebecca!

20:08.579 --> 20:10.080
Rebecca!

20:10.114 --> 20:11.714
Catherine, stop, don't do this!

20:11.748 --> 20:13.216
Catherine, wait!

20:13.250 --> 20:17.053
Catherine, you don't know
what you're doing.

20:17.088 --> 20:18.855
Catherine!

20:20.235 --> 20:21.612
Be ready, allright.

20:21.636 --> 20:22.652
This one's a wildcard.

20:22.653 --> 20:24.803
Everybody has full magazines
on backup, you copy?

20:25.006 --> 20:26.006
Vargas!

20:27.983 --> 20:29.550
All right, the tranq
darts are loaded,

20:29.584 --> 20:30.952
although I still don't
know why we need so many

20:30.986 --> 20:32.053
just to capture one man.

20:32.087 --> 20:33.621
Trust me, we'll need them.

20:33.655 --> 20:35.489
All right, where's Chandler?
What are we waiting on?

20:35.524 --> 20:36.891
Look, for the record,
if Cat brings you Gabe,

20:36.926 --> 20:38.058
she gets her
shield back, right?

20:38.092 --> 20:39.327
<i>If</i> he's proven guilty.

20:39.361 --> 20:40.661
He will be.

20:40.696 --> 20:42.496
Really? 'Cause right now
I don't have a suspect

20:42.531 --> 20:43.764
or any evidence
against him.

20:43.799 --> 20:45.265
All I've got is my ass

20:45.300 --> 20:46.734
flapping in the breeze

20:46.768 --> 20:48.068
and the media,
the mayor and the FBI

20:48.102 --> 20:49.136
breathing down
my neck.

20:49.170 --> 20:51.339
Look, a deal
is a deal.

20:51.373 --> 20:52.807
You give me Lowan

20:52.841 --> 20:54.074
or I get Keller.

20:54.108 --> 20:56.609
The city's on edge,
Detective.

20:56.644 --> 20:58.912
One way or the other,
this ends tonight.

20:58.947 --> 20:59.980
You understand?

21:00.014 --> 21:02.015
Yeah.

21:02.050 --> 21:04.218
Miller. Vito.
In my office.

21:12.292 --> 21:13.793
Where have you been?
I've been calling

21:13.828 --> 21:15.127
and calling you.
Ward's all over me.

21:15.162 --> 21:17.129
I'm sorry, it's just...
I'm sorry.

21:17.164 --> 21:18.297
You okay?

21:18.332 --> 21:20.834
Yeah. It's just...

21:20.868 --> 21:22.769
that was harder than I thought--
locking up Vincent.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.337
Oh. He didn't
take it well?

21:24.372 --> 21:25.805
Just kidding.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.173
Look, we have to make
a move here, okay?

21:27.207 --> 21:28.307
Ward's under some
serious pressure

21:28.342 --> 21:29.708
to deliver a psycho.

21:29.743 --> 21:31.677
I know. I have to
lead Gabe to the trap.

21:31.711 --> 21:32.879
- Is there a problem?

21:32.913 --> 21:35.681
No. This is the
best way to catch him.

21:35.715 --> 21:37.216
There's just something
about this that feels wrong,

21:37.251 --> 21:38.650
doing it without Vincent.

21:38.685 --> 21:40.686
Well, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.989
Okay, look, we got SWAT
locked and loaded.

21:43.023 --> 21:44.523
I know.
And like my father said,

21:44.557 --> 21:46.725
I have to do everything I can
to protect him.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.396
What if,
what if my dad's wrong?

21:50.430 --> 21:51.663
What if Rebecca's wrong?

21:51.698 --> 21:53.565
Rebecca again?

21:53.600 --> 21:56.402
There's just...
there's something

21:56.436 --> 21:57.669
that I keep thinking about

21:57.704 --> 21:59.037
that she wrote at the
end of her journal

21:59.071 --> 22:00.138
after Alistair died.

22:00.172 --> 22:01.672
It's made me wonder

22:01.707 --> 22:02.874
if, in trying
to protect him,

22:02.909 --> 22:04.242
she inadvertently
made him vulnerable.

22:04.277 --> 22:07.212
And    <i>that</i> what
got him killed.

22:07.246 --> 22:08.579
Cat, you have to make

22:08.614 --> 22:09.847
a decision here, okay?
This is going down.

22:09.882 --> 22:11.049
You know, if we don't
deliver Gabe,

22:11.083 --> 22:12.250
I don't know...
- I know.

22:12.285 --> 22:13.818
I know. I'll go leave
the blood trail

22:13.852 --> 22:15.753
and I'll call you
to get Ward

22:15.788 --> 22:17.254
in position.
If we trap Gabe,

22:17.289 --> 22:18.823
then I don't have to
worry about any of this, right?

22:18.857 --> 22:20.024
Yeah.

22:20.058 --> 22:22.192
You know, I envy you.

22:22.227 --> 22:24.328
I do. What you're doing
for Vincent.

22:24.362 --> 22:25.496
What you two have together,

22:25.531 --> 22:26.664
it's, uh...

22:26.698 --> 22:28.433
it's what every girl wants.

22:28.467 --> 22:30.234
No, you don't want this, Tess.

22:30.268 --> 22:32.336
All right, maybe not all of it.

22:32.370 --> 22:33.503
Certainly not the part
where the city

22:33.538 --> 22:35.005
wants to burn my boyfriend.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.274
But... no. It's just,
it's made me think.

22:37.309 --> 22:38.409
You know, like, how do I know

22:38.443 --> 22:40.844
JT's really the one?

22:40.878 --> 22:43.713
This is obviously not
a priority right now.

22:43.748 --> 22:45.416
So, just go
get Gabe, okay?

22:45.450 --> 22:47.330
So we can all figure out our damn lives.
- Okay.

24:03.125 --> 24:04.291
<i>Rebecca, listen to me,</i>

24:04.326 --> 24:05.426
he is killing innocent people,

24:05.460 --> 24:07.028
making it look like
I'm doing it.

24:07.062 --> 24:08.630
That's because all he
cares about is killing you,

24:08.664 --> 24:09.664
destroying you.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.435
<i>We will stop him, I promise.</i>

24:14.469 --> 24:16.437
But not this way,
not your way.

24:16.471 --> 24:17.911
You know another way
to stop a beast?

24:20.208 --> 24:21.942
Rebecca, wait!

24:21.976 --> 24:23.544
Rebecca!

24:23.578 --> 24:25.913
Rebecca, you have
no idea what you're doing!

24:27.882 --> 24:29.149
Catherine, come on!

24:29.183 --> 24:30.817
Catherine,

24:30.852 --> 24:31.852
stop, don't do this!

24:33.320 --> 24:34.988
<i>I didn't do it!</i>

24:35.023 --> 24:36.389
You've got the wrong man!
Don't listen to him!

24:36.424 --> 24:38.291
Let me go!
Let's burn him!

24:38.325 --> 24:41.094
Get off me!

24:42.664 --> 24:44.831
Seize him! Seize him!

24:44.866 --> 24:45.866
He's the beast!

24:47.234 --> 24:48.901
We'll have him,
we'll have the beast!

24:51.405 --> 24:52.672
Alistair?

24:58.045 --> 25:00.613
Oh, my God.

25:04.517 --> 25:06.719
You have the wrong man!

25:06.753 --> 25:08.721
Please!

25:08.755 --> 25:11.323
Please, I'm begging!

25:11.357 --> 25:13.092
I am not the beast!

25:13.126 --> 25:14.961
Murderer!

25:18.098 --> 25:21.233
I am not the beast...!

25:31.277 --> 25:32.511
Vincent.

25:40.886 --> 25:42.186
Why hasn't Chandler called yet?

25:42.221 --> 25:43.688
I don't know.

25:43.723 --> 25:44.956
Let me tell
you something, Detective,

25:44.991 --> 25:46.725
if this is just
a stall tactic

25:46.759 --> 25:48.693
so she spirit Keller out
of town again, I'm gonna...

25:48.728 --> 25:50.194
Cat, answer your
damn phone.

25:52.764 --> 25:54.898
Oh, thank God you're okay.

25:54.933 --> 25:56.967
No, I am not okay.
You locked me in a cage!

25:57.002 --> 25:58.202
Yeah, you're mad.

25:58.237 --> 25:59.403
Oh. Oh, you think
I'm mad, really?

25:59.438 --> 26:00.638
How would you like it

26:00.672 --> 26:02.406
if I locked you
in a cage, huh?

26:02.441 --> 26:04.808
Hold on, did, did
Gabe do something?

26:04.843 --> 26:06.277
No.

26:06.311 --> 26:08.278
I don't know.

26:08.312 --> 26:10.914
First JT told me that you could
get killed going after Gabe.

26:10.949 --> 26:12.449
And then my father said
that you would have to

26:12.483 --> 26:13.784
lose your humanity
to fight Gabe.

26:13.818 --> 26:14.952
And then Rebecca...

26:14.986 --> 26:16.086
Rebecca, really?

26:16.121 --> 26:17.921
Come on, you're
still on that?

26:17.956 --> 26:19.556
Please get that gem
out of my sight.

26:19.590 --> 26:20.924
It's just that everything
they were going through

26:20.959 --> 26:22.425
was so similar to us,

26:22.460 --> 26:23.761
I wanted to do
exactly what

26:23.795 --> 26:25.828
Rebecca did
to protect Alistair.

26:25.863 --> 26:27.830
And then I started worrying

26:27.865 --> 26:29.432
that that's what got him killed.

26:29.467 --> 26:30.833
Trying to protect him

26:30.868 --> 26:32.335
instead of trusting them.

26:32.370 --> 26:33.370
Trusting that everything

26:33.371 --> 26:34.737
that they'd been through,

26:34.772 --> 26:37.307
everything that we
have been through

26:37.341 --> 26:39.676
makes us stronger as a couple.

26:39.710 --> 26:41.911
Mm-hmm.

26:43.213 --> 26:45.614
Please forgive me.

26:45.649 --> 26:47.582
Mm-mm.

26:49.218 --> 26:50.418
Okay.

26:54.123 --> 26:56.191
You were right...

26:56.225 --> 26:59.027
from stopping me
from going after Gabe.

26:59.062 --> 27:01.697
I wasn't thinking about us,
I was just...

27:01.731 --> 27:02.964
thinking about killing him

27:02.999 --> 27:04.632
for everything he's done.

27:04.667 --> 27:05.800
I don't know,

27:05.834 --> 27:06.834
maybe I would've
crossed the line,

27:06.868 --> 27:08.203
but I didn't care.

27:08.237 --> 27:09.437
Vincent,
you have to care.

27:09.471 --> 27:11.872
Because caring
about what's right,

27:11.907 --> 27:13.541
caring about us...

27:13.576 --> 27:16.143
that's what makes you
different from Gabe.

27:16.178 --> 27:18.979
Hmm.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.447
So, where do we start?

27:20.481 --> 27:22.449
JT.

27:22.483 --> 27:23.951
He's putting together
some evidence

27:23.985 --> 27:25.485
so we can incriminate Gabe
once we trap him.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.821
And what if
we can't trap him?

27:26.855 --> 27:28.222
Apparently,
he's pretty powerful now.

27:28.256 --> 27:30.290
Then we will come up
with another plan.

27:30.325 --> 27:31.792
Together...

27:31.827 --> 27:32.993
this time.

27:41.153 --> 27:43.087
Knock, knock,
JT, you home?

27:52.865 --> 27:54.632
No.

27:54.666 --> 27:57.134
JT?

28:04.824 --> 28:07.421
BP's 80/40 and slowing
pulse is barely palpable.

28:07.422 --> 28:08.589
Pupils are fixed and dilated,
nonresponsive.

28:08.623 --> 28:10.657
St. Benjamin's, we're coming in
with a Code Blue,

28:10.691 --> 28:12.682
severe trauma, extreme blood loss.
Vincent, talk to me,

28:12.683 --> 28:14.550
how is he?
He's in hypovolemic shock.

28:14.584 --> 28:16.344
Come on, get him out of here,
guys. Let's go!

28:16.352 --> 28:17.352
JT, what happened?!

28:17.387 --> 28:18.788
Lady, you got to move.

28:18.822 --> 28:19.989
When did this happen?!
How did this happen?!

28:20.023 --> 28:20.989
They need to take him
to the hospital.

28:21.023 --> 28:22.558
What hospital?! Where?!

28:22.592 --> 28:24.025
How bad is it, Cat? He's...

28:24.060 --> 28:26.228
he's not gonna die, is he?
I don't know, Tess.

28:26.262 --> 28:28.063
But right now, JT needs you.
Do you understand?

28:28.097 --> 28:29.565
He needs you by his side.

28:29.599 --> 28:30.832
He needs you strong.

28:30.866 --> 28:32.067
Okay.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.203
I was so mean to him.

28:34.237 --> 28:36.371
Hey, hey... come on.

28:36.406 --> 28:37.839
Okay.
- He knows,

28:37.873 --> 28:39.473
he knows how you feel
about him, okay?

28:39.508 --> 28:40.541
He knows.

28:40.576 --> 28:42.811
Come here.

28:42.845 --> 28:44.979
He needs you right now.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.047
Okay?

28:46.082 --> 28:48.016
Okay.

28:51.787 --> 28:53.921
Vincent.

29:04.933 --> 29:06.033
Vincent, we had a deal.

29:06.067 --> 29:08.836
That was before
he butchered our friend.

29:08.870 --> 29:10.437
So, what, it's back to
kill or be killed?

29:10.471 --> 29:13.073
Do it your way
or die trying?

29:13.108 --> 29:14.108
Catherine,
Gabe just ripped

29:14.142 --> 29:16.009
JT to shreds.

29:16.044 --> 29:17.911
Okay, for all I know,
my best friend is gonna die.

29:17.946 --> 29:19.012
So, what's next?

29:19.047 --> 29:21.048
Huh? He kills Tess?

29:21.082 --> 29:23.550
How about your father,
then Heather, then you, huh?

29:25.153 --> 29:27.954
Damn it, I'm sorry, I didn't...

29:27.988 --> 29:29.188
No, this is
exactly what he wants.

29:29.223 --> 29:30.290
He wants to
destroy you

29:30.324 --> 29:31.791
or watch you
destroy yourself,

29:31.825 --> 29:33.025
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen

29:33.060 --> 29:34.728
if we don't
do this together.

29:34.762 --> 29:37.564
I don't need any help
in killing Gabe.

29:37.598 --> 29:38.898
How do you know?

29:38.932 --> 29:41.868
What if you fail and die?
Then what?

29:41.902 --> 29:44.070
Gabe lives on
to kill all of us anyway,

29:44.104 --> 29:45.772
because that's what he is now,
he's a monster, Vincent.

29:45.806 --> 29:47.339
You saw what he did to JT.

29:48.575 --> 29:50.042
Is that what you want to become?

29:52.279 --> 29:53.980
If you do this by yourself,

29:54.014 --> 29:56.382
everything is lost.

29:57.651 --> 29:59.551
<i>Vincent.</i>

30:01.988 --> 30:03.121
Come out, come out

30:03.156 --> 30:04.923
wherever you are.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.215
This is where you want
to do it, Vincent? Really?

30:39.458 --> 30:42.059
You don't want to embarrass
yourself in public, is that it?

30:44.496 --> 30:47.097
You know what
your problem is, Gabe?

30:47.132 --> 30:49.300
You can't handle...

30:50.135 --> 30:52.769
...rejection.

30:52.804 --> 30:55.840
And I cannot handle
what you did to JT.

30:55.874 --> 30:59.009
And the journalist
and Agent Knox.

30:59.044 --> 31:01.178
I had to get
your attention somehow.

31:02.347 --> 31:03.780
Do you think

31:03.815 --> 31:05.015
Catherine will take me back

31:05.050 --> 31:06.282
once you're dead?

31:06.317 --> 31:08.284
Not a chance.

31:08.319 --> 31:10.887
In that case I got nothing lose.

31:10.921 --> 31:12.823
You, on the other hand,

31:12.857 --> 31:15.459
have everything to lose.

31:52.962 --> 31:54.263
You can't cross the line,

31:54.297 --> 31:55.364
can you?

31:55.398 --> 31:57.165
Catherine would be so proud.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.001
She is.

32:07.110 --> 32:08.210
What are you doing?

32:08.244 --> 32:09.711
Stopping you.

32:10.947 --> 32:12.179
Just had to
keep you busy

32:12.214 --> 32:13.415
long enough until
I heard those

32:13.449 --> 32:14.749
police sirens.

32:14.784 --> 32:16.217
Just so you know,

32:16.251 --> 32:17.719
attacking JT didn't stop him

32:17.753 --> 32:19.421
from putting together
all the evidence we need

32:19.455 --> 32:20.789
to connect everything to you.

32:20.823 --> 32:22.624
And I mean
everything.

32:22.658 --> 32:25.092
You're going to jail,
you bastard.

32:25.127 --> 32:27.094
Catherine!

32:27.897 --> 32:29.163
Aah!

32:42.776 --> 32:44.710
Hey. You all right?

32:44.745 --> 32:46.179
Yeah.

32:48.582 --> 32:50.516
It's over.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.579
You'll be able to match Gabe's
DNA to the murder scene

33:04.580 --> 33:06.048
but what Professor Forbes

33:06.082 --> 33:07.816
put in here shows what Gabe

33:07.850 --> 33:09.317
did to himself to become...

33:09.351 --> 33:10.886
Crazy.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.253
He injected himself

33:12.287 --> 33:14.322
with experimental
DNA over the years,

33:14.356 --> 33:17.058
documented in his own
handwriting, including serums

33:17.092 --> 33:18.493
with cross-species DNA.

33:18.528 --> 33:20.495
Cross-species?

33:20.530 --> 33:22.564
What do you mean,
like, animals?

33:22.598 --> 33:24.598
He wouldn't be
the first person

33:24.633 --> 33:26.734
to try to become
superhuman, right?

33:26.768 --> 33:28.836
Well, it certainly explains

33:28.870 --> 33:30.771
why the guy went bananas,
but still

33:30.805 --> 33:32.706
it's pretty wild.

33:32.741 --> 33:36.210
You're lucky you got out
of there alive. Both of you.

33:36.245 --> 33:39.414
And, uh, remind me
never to piss you off.

33:40.815 --> 33:42.215
So does this mean

33:42.250 --> 33:43.851
that I'm finally off the hook?

33:43.885 --> 33:47.054
I mean, obviously we have
to conduct an investigation,

33:47.088 --> 33:50.257
but if all this
holds up, yeah,

33:50.291 --> 33:51.291
of course.

33:53.929 --> 33:55.863
We have to get to the hospital.
Yeah.

33:55.897 --> 33:58.465
Wait, you, uh,

33:58.499 --> 34:01.034
forgot something...

34:01.069 --> 34:03.603
Detective.

34:29.963 --> 34:31.263
Tess?

34:33.800 --> 34:35.967
He's not gonna make it.

34:36.002 --> 34:37.869
Oh.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.975
The doctors said he
lost too much blood,

34:43.009 --> 34:45.411
there's...

34:45.445 --> 34:47.713
there's nothing
they can do.

34:49.815 --> 34:52.417
This can't be happening.
I got to see him, where is he?

34:52.451 --> 34:54.284
Code Blue, Code Blue...

34:54.320 --> 34:56.088
What's happening?
He's coding.

34:56.121 --> 34:57.522
Bring in a crash cart.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.825
Let's move it, people.

35:06.198 --> 35:07.665
Hey, guys,

35:07.699 --> 35:09.634
what's up?
JT.

35:09.668 --> 35:11.902
Easy, ow.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:13.739 --> 35:15.140
I thought
I'd lost you.

35:15.174 --> 35:16.841
Not a chance.

35:23.248 --> 35:24.481
So,

35:24.516 --> 35:25.950
did we win?

35:25.984 --> 35:28.352
Oh, yeah, buddy,
we won, all right.

35:29.988 --> 35:32.723
How did you...?
Is he

35:32.758 --> 35:33.991
gonna be okay?

35:34.026 --> 35:36.793
Count on it.

35:36.827 --> 35:39.329
You.

35:39.364 --> 35:40.830
What is it?

35:40.865 --> 35:42.832
Perhaps we should let
the good professor rest.

35:42.867 --> 35:44.301
Shall we?

35:46.404 --> 35:47.871
I'll be right back, okay?

35:47.905 --> 35:49.406
Okay.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.808
Bring back gummies.

35:58.382 --> 36:00.884
All right, start talking.

36:00.918 --> 36:02.418
Vincent,
what's going on?

36:02.452 --> 36:03.987
Meet the government agents
I was telling you about.

36:04.021 --> 36:07.023
The ones who put me in a lab
and tried to kill me.

36:07.058 --> 36:09.692
If we wanted to kill you, why
would we have got you exonerated?

36:09.726 --> 36:11.760
Of course, that was before
Lowan tried to undo everything.

36:11.784 --> 36:12.861
You should've taken him out

36:12.862 --> 36:14.863
when you had the chance
a couple of days ago.

36:14.898 --> 36:17.400
Who are you?
- We're the people that just

36:17.434 --> 36:18.767
saved your friend's life.

36:18.802 --> 36:22.071
Two questions:
how and why?

36:22.105 --> 36:24.006
How? We used
an experimental

36:24.040 --> 36:26.408
nanoplasma to trigger
the molecule regeneration.

36:26.442 --> 36:29.011
Trust me, the medical field
knows nothing about this.

36:29.045 --> 36:30.579
And as for why?

36:30.613 --> 36:32.247
That's what we do
and who we are.

36:32.281 --> 36:33.749
But that's all
you get to know.

36:33.783 --> 36:35.918
Unless you agree
to help us.

36:35.952 --> 36:38.020
Help you do what?

36:38.054 --> 36:40.956
Let's just say that in a world
where science can create beasts,

36:40.990 --> 36:42.524
you shouldn't be surprised
to learn that there's

36:42.558 --> 36:43.758
a lot worse things out there.

36:43.792 --> 36:46.027
Worse threats.
Which is why

36:46.061 --> 36:47.696
we've been
watching you--

36:47.730 --> 36:48.963
both of you.

36:50.399 --> 36:52.434
And now that we
know what you can do

36:52.468 --> 36:53.568
and who you are,

36:53.603 --> 36:55.370
we're gonna need your help

36:55.404 --> 36:58.706
to figure out exactly
what we're up against.

36:58.741 --> 37:01.475
Okay, well, I know you've
been through a lot today,

37:01.509 --> 37:03.711
so we can talk more
about this later, but not

37:03.746 --> 37:05.246
much later.
And Vincent--

37:05.280 --> 37:08.750
make sure to keep watching
his T cell count.

37:08.784 --> 37:09.784
