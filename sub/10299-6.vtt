01:16.801 --> 01:18.066
<i>Marry me, Cherise.</i>

01:18.100 --> 01:19.999
<i>You're the only one
for me.</i>

01:20.033 --> 01:22.333
<i>But, Blair, you said that
to the twins,</i>

01:22.367 --> 01:23.834
<i>who are secretly
your daughters,</i>

01:23.868 --> 01:27.733
<i>who you fathered
when you were in that coma.</i>

01:27.767 --> 01:29.834
You can't really have children
with a man in a coma,

01:29.868 --> 01:31.667
can you, Mom?

01:35.133 --> 01:38.733
I think there have been
two recorded cases.

01:38.767 --> 01:41.900
I'm home, and I'm feeling foul.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.266
So let's have
a parting of the butts

01:44.300 --> 01:46.401
so I can sit down.

01:48.701 --> 01:51.467
Is the fun always over
when Daddy comes home, Mom?

01:51.501 --> 01:52.900
Well, it's just
suspended now.

01:52.934 --> 01:56.066
It's not officially over
till he takes off his shoes.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.266
Kelly, honey, I know
you're a high school graduate,

01:59.300 --> 02:00.934
but you may be unaware
of a new law.

02:00.968 --> 02:03.066
Since 1989,

02:03.100 --> 02:07.200
the government only permits
one human lump per family.

02:07.234 --> 02:09.199
So I'm afraid
the time has come

02:09.234 --> 02:11.700
for you to get a job.

02:11.734 --> 02:13.400
Oh, no, Daddy,
you're wrong.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.300
Mommy says that I don't
have to do anything.

02:15.334 --> 02:18.467
I'm a girl.

02:18.501 --> 02:22.066
Sweetheart, your mother is
the last of a vanishing breed:

02:22.100 --> 02:25.233
the tyrannosaurus-
do-nothingnus.

02:25.267 --> 02:27.233
But there's still
hope for you, honey.

02:27.267 --> 02:29.133
You can still
get up off a couch

02:29.167 --> 02:31.167
without it making
a suction noise.

02:33.534 --> 02:36.366
So join with Daddy,
won't you, please,

02:36.400 --> 02:39.167
in actually earning
a living.

02:39.567 --> 02:40.533
But, honey,

02:40.567 --> 02:42.033
for Daddy's ego,

02:42.067 --> 02:44.966
try not to bring home
more money than he does.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.500
So I'd say,
try returning pop bottles.

02:48.534 --> 02:49.999
But stop at 10.

02:50.033 --> 02:53.200
They're two cents apiece,
you know.

02:53.234 --> 02:54.467
"Oh, gee, Your Honor,

02:54.501 --> 02:58.234
I don't know where that shotgun
came from."

02:59.968 --> 03:01.266
Now, Kelly, honey,

03:01.300 --> 03:02.867
you're getting
old enough to know now

03:02.901 --> 03:05.700
that you can't go on
mooching off society forever.

03:05.734 --> 03:07.934
So go over
to Marcie's house,

03:07.968 --> 03:09.567
steal her newspaper

03:09.601 --> 03:12.001
and bring back the section
with the want ads.

03:14.067 --> 03:15.366
Al,

03:15.400 --> 03:17.333
did you really mean
what you said about me?

03:17.367 --> 03:19.066
You really think
I do nothing?

03:19.100 --> 03:20.733
Peg, if you did any less
around here,

03:20.767 --> 03:22.834
it would be called
"haunting."

03:23.601 --> 03:26.133
Well, then you have
a pretty short memory.

03:26.167 --> 03:29.967
It's me who brass-knuckles
your underwear into that hamper.

03:31.434 --> 03:33.300
And who invented
the broomstick

03:33.334 --> 03:34.800
with the piece of gum
on the end of it

03:34.834 --> 03:37.066
to pick up your socks?

03:37.100 --> 03:39.934
I believe it was I.

03:39.968 --> 03:42.200
Now, I do plenty around here.

03:42.234 --> 03:43.867
I want an apology,

03:43.901 --> 03:45.867
and I want appreciation.

03:45.901 --> 03:47.767
Until I get some,

03:47.801 --> 03:49.533
I, Peggy Bundy,

03:49.567 --> 03:52.633
am officially on strike.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.633
Look, Daddy,

03:56.667 --> 03:59.200
I found a job.
Listen.

03:59.234 --> 04:00.966
"Pretty girls needed.

04:01.000 --> 04:01.966
"No skills.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.467
"No talent.

04:04.501 --> 04:06.300
"No experience.

04:06.334 --> 04:07.934
No redding."

04:10.367 --> 04:12.867
That's "reading,"
honey.

04:13.634 --> 04:15.033
No reading?

04:15.067 --> 04:18.466
Where are they gonna
find anyone that stupid?

04:18.500 --> 04:19.632
No, but look.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.033
"Four hundred dollars
a month."

04:21.067 --> 04:23.200
Now, that should help out
the family, eh, Daddy?

04:23.234 --> 04:24.834
Well, uh, sweetheart...

04:24.868 --> 04:27.633
Dear, this is an ad
for a modeling school.

04:27.667 --> 04:31.368
See, I'd have to pay
$400 a month.

04:32.567 --> 04:33.999
So, what's the problem?

04:34.033 --> 04:37.500
Can you describe the difference
between paying and earning?

04:37.534 --> 04:39.934
What am I asking you for?
Of course you can't.

04:40.634 --> 04:42.700
Oh, come on, Daddy,
I wanna be a model.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.500
Hey, maybe I can get
one of those neat jobs

04:44.534 --> 04:46.767
standing in a store window.

04:50.033 --> 04:51.900
Peg, you wanna
take this one?

04:51.934 --> 04:54.567
You wanna get down
on your hands and knees

04:54.601 --> 04:57.167
and admit
I'm everything to you?

04:59.534 --> 05:02.999
Kelly, I'm not paying
$400 a month

05:03.033 --> 05:05.867
so you can walk around
with a book on your head.

05:07.234 --> 05:08.966
Hey, go ahead,
pout all you want.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.967
It's not going to work.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.234
I am a model.

05:24.501 --> 05:26.600
I'm not cooking tonight,
you know.

05:26.634 --> 05:28.066
Uh-oh.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.034
Then I guess I'll just
have to live on love.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.934
Not with me.
I'm on strike.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.133
Oh, no.

05:36.167 --> 05:39.167
Then I guess
I'll just have to live.

05:39.968 --> 05:41.099
Look, Daddy.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.234
And you thought that
your $400 was wasted.

05:46.634 --> 05:48.066
I'm okay, Daddy.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.266
Sure you are,
sweetheart.

05:50.300 --> 05:53.133
Honey, now, go sit
over there.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.867
Sit down, dear.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.468
I am a model.

06:03.734 --> 06:06.200
Good, sweetheart.

06:06.234 --> 06:09.066
But, honey,
you have been a model

06:09.100 --> 06:10.800
for two weeks now.

06:10.834 --> 06:12.633
You know,
if the telephone rings,

06:12.667 --> 06:14.533
I'm not gettin' it.

06:14.567 --> 06:16.700
Well, darn, if I miss another
dinner with the Trumps

06:16.734 --> 06:19.368
because of you, I'm gonna
take it out on the help.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.733
Honey, this modeling thing
isn't working out.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.467
But-- But I have an idea.

06:25.501 --> 06:26.934
Why don't you take
the skills

06:26.968 --> 06:28.867
you've acquired
at modeling school

06:28.901 --> 06:31.099
and get an important job.

06:31.133 --> 06:34.600
One where you meet the public
and serve them French fries.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.433
But, Daddy,
I can't stop now.

06:38.467 --> 06:40.400
Modeling is in my blood.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.166
I mean, even my teacher said

06:42.200 --> 06:45.166
that I am a natural-born
leg crosser.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.700
Watch.

06:50.267 --> 06:52.233
I can do it at will.

06:52.267 --> 06:53.800
<i>What?</i>

06:54.234 --> 06:55.333
Okay, Kel,

06:55.367 --> 06:56.733
I did what you asked.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.900
<i>I put all your Garfield cartoons
on cassette tape</i>

06:58.934 --> 07:01.099
so you can listen to them
in the car.

07:01.133 --> 07:03.134
Now can I meet
the modeling babes?

07:03.501 --> 07:04.733
Isn't he pathetic?

07:04.767 --> 07:06.733
Yeah, right. But don't
worry about him. Honey,

07:06.767 --> 07:09.700
have you seen anything
down there Daddy might like?

07:12.267 --> 07:13.633
Yeah.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.999
You know, maybe there's a job
for a runway model

07:16.033 --> 07:17.867
with dirty underwear.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.133
"And now, here's Al,

07:21.167 --> 07:23.233
"looking frisky for fall

07:23.267 --> 07:26.633
"in his stained boxer shorts

07:26.667 --> 07:30.267
"and matching
yellowing T-shirt.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.934
"Oh, note the holes,

07:32.968 --> 07:36.834
"new this season,
for easy-access scratchin'.

07:37.901 --> 07:41.200
"Oh, thank you, Al.

07:41.234 --> 07:44.133
"Oh, and walking behind him,

07:44.167 --> 07:47.201
"his socks.

07:48.133 --> 07:49.633
"Resplendent

07:49.667 --> 07:52.667
"in their
no-toe-or-heel look.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.633
Thanks again, Al."

08:02.968 --> 08:05.133
"Gee, officer, if I thought
my wife was missing,

08:05.167 --> 08:07.533
would I be in this bar,
drinking a beer?"

08:11.267 --> 08:12.533
Come on, Kel.

08:12.567 --> 08:13.834
I'll do anything.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.099
Well, actually,
you could help me study

08:16.133 --> 08:18.099
for this job audition
at the auto show.

08:18.133 --> 08:20.234
Can you be a car?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.233
Then will I get to meet
the babes?

08:22.267 --> 08:25.334
Pretty ones
as dumb as you?

08:25.801 --> 08:26.867
Dumber.

08:26.901 --> 08:29.266
Oh, man.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.767
What kind of car am I?

08:30.801 --> 08:33.134
A 280 Zit.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.833
They better be mighty dumb,
Kel.

08:38.868 --> 08:40.999
Okay, now,

08:41.033 --> 08:43.099
you just stand here
and "car."

08:43.133 --> 08:44.333
Now, my job is to come up

08:44.367 --> 08:45.934
with an interesting
and exciting way

08:45.968 --> 08:47.966
to introduce
the new AllantÃ©.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.066
You ready?

08:49.100 --> 08:50.400
Ready.
Okay.

08:50.434 --> 08:52.567
The new-- No.

08:52.868 --> 08:54.966
The new-- No.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.034
The new...

09:03.934 --> 09:06.500
Four hundred bucks.

09:06.534 --> 09:08.567
Wait, I'm getting an idea.
I'm getting an idea.

09:08.601 --> 09:10.434
How 'bout this?

09:10.934 --> 09:13.467
The new...

09:13.501 --> 09:15.366
Oh, what's the name
of the stupid car?

09:15.400 --> 09:17.767
Kelly, why don't you just
write it on your hand

09:17.801 --> 09:20.166
like you do your name.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.066
No, wait.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.101
Topeka, I have found it!

09:29.767 --> 09:32.767
I-- I don't think
you mean Topeka, Kel.

09:32.801 --> 09:34.266
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I meant...

09:34.300 --> 09:36.001
urethra!

09:40.834 --> 09:42.667
How 'bout this?

09:44.434 --> 09:48.301
The new AllantÃ©.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.834
What do you think?
What do you think?

09:50.868 --> 09:53.368
I think you got it.

09:53.667 --> 09:54.999
I know I've got it.

09:55.033 --> 09:56.800
I shall be the AllantÃ© girl,

09:56.834 --> 10:00.167
for I have invented
"the Bundy bounce."

10:04.567 --> 10:06.733
AllantÃ©.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.333
AllantÃ©.
AllantÃ©.

10:08.367 --> 10:10.700
AllantÃ©.
AllantÃ©.

10:11.067 --> 10:13.200
AllantÃ©.
AllantÃ©.

10:13.234 --> 10:15.900
AllantÃ©.
AllantÃ©.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.533
AllantÃ©.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.834
Wow!

10:19.868 --> 10:22.099
I feel like I died
and went to Dad's happy box

10:22.133 --> 10:24.401
in the basement.

10:25.868 --> 10:28.700
I beg of you,
PepÃ© Le Pew.

10:28.734 --> 10:31.400
Control your urges
and your scent, okay?

10:31.434 --> 10:33.366
I'm gonna go practice
my AllantÃ©s.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.233
Okay. I'm just gonna
wander around and...

10:36.267 --> 10:38.134
see what's bitin'.

10:40.734 --> 10:43.800
I do believe
I sees my supper.

10:46.868 --> 10:48.600
Hello.

10:50.601 --> 10:53.767
I know you models are always
watching your weight.

10:53.801 --> 10:56.167
Care for a "Bud light"?

11:04.300 --> 11:07.166
I'm sorry, but I think
you've mistaken me

11:07.200 --> 11:11.034
for someone who would speak
to someone like you.

11:13.367 --> 11:15.900
Stee-rike one.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.201
Ooh.

11:22.734 --> 11:24.934
Need some help?

11:27.501 --> 11:29.967
One good turn
deserves another.

11:33.501 --> 11:36.167
Stee-rike two.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.201
Allantum. No.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.600
Allantos.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.633
No.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.401
Aluminum.

11:45.534 --> 11:46.900
Kelly.

11:46.934 --> 11:48.233
No.

11:48.267 --> 11:51.034
AllantÃ©.

11:51.701 --> 11:52.767
Hi, Kelly.

11:52.801 --> 11:54.200
Been practicing?

11:54.234 --> 11:55.900
Nope, don't need to.

11:55.934 --> 11:58.166
I'm slam-dunking
this baby.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.834
You seem pretty confident
for someone

11:59.868 --> 12:03.301
who got tension headaches
during smiling class.

12:05.567 --> 12:08.500
So, what are you doing
for your audition?

12:09.334 --> 12:12.099
Well, I come after you,

12:12.133 --> 12:13.333
so I guess
I'll have to wait

12:13.367 --> 12:15.667
till the curly tail
disappears.

12:17.734 --> 12:18.767
Oh, then, of course,

12:18.801 --> 12:22.200
after the cries
of "sooey" die down,

12:22.234 --> 12:25.334
I'll do my best to follow
in your hoofprints.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.667
Slut.

12:32.701 --> 12:34.633
Skank.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.767
Tramp.

12:36.801 --> 12:39.434
Can't accessorize.

12:41.033 --> 12:43.700
That hurt.

12:44.634 --> 12:47.101
With you?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.234
Foul tip.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.166
Excuse me.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.567
I couldn't help
but noticing you

12:58.601 --> 13:01.267
undressing me
with your eyes.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.600
How'd you like
to hear my recipe

13:03.634 --> 13:06.500
for a love cocktail?

13:06.534 --> 13:08.467
One cup of you,
two cups of me,

13:08.501 --> 13:11.067
put it to boil,
and serve while hot.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.733
Look, I'll let you
touch my hair

13:15.767 --> 13:17.333
if you go away
and leave me alone.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.233
I have to audition.

13:19.267 --> 13:20.900
You're wasting
your time, babe.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.966
My sister's got it locked.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.433
Who's your sister?

13:24.467 --> 13:25.567
Kelly.

13:25.601 --> 13:28.333
Anyhow, what do you say to
"you and me

13:28.367 --> 13:31.500
and one of your friends
makes three"?

13:33.701 --> 13:35.800
What exactly
is Kelly doing?

13:35.834 --> 13:38.267
She told me not
to tell anybody.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.533
Not even me?

13:41.567 --> 13:43.334
No one.

13:44.033 --> 13:46.033
Not even...

13:46.067 --> 13:47.800
me?

13:49.334 --> 13:52.101
It's called "the Bundy bounce,"
and it goes like this:

13:52.868 --> 13:55.066
The new...

13:55.100 --> 13:57.134
AllantÃ©.

13:57.801 --> 14:00.233
Thanks. That's all
I needed to know.

14:00.267 --> 14:02.967
Wait, y-you said I could
touch your hair.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.433
AllantÃ©.
Okay, everybody.

14:06.467 --> 14:08.934
Ladies, attention.

14:08.968 --> 14:10.834
Attention, ladies.

14:14.133 --> 14:16.834
The client is here.

14:16.868 --> 14:19.300
Let's show him
what we can do, all right?

14:19.334 --> 14:23.001
First up,
Rochelle Alpert.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.133
The new Alpert.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.900
Oops. That's my name.

14:31.934 --> 14:34.600
AllantÃ©.
AllantÃ©.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.468
Very good.
Very good, Rochelle.

14:39.934 --> 14:42.633
Incense Berkowitz.

14:45.167 --> 14:48.567
<i>That's Incense Berkowitz.</i>

14:48.601 --> 14:50.700
Next.

14:53.734 --> 14:55.767
Piper Bauman.

14:56.501 --> 14:59.734
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

15:00.701 --> 15:03.434
Well, then perhaps you
should've worn underwear.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.167
Just do the best you can,
sweetheart.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.167
The new AllantÃ©.

15:15.367 --> 15:18.567
Thank you.
I call it "the Bauman bounce."

15:18.601 --> 15:21.266
She stole my bounce.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.166
Gee, how could that
have happened?

15:24.200 --> 15:25.700
Excellent,
excellent.

15:25.734 --> 15:29.334
And now, as if there was
any need, Kelly Bundy.

15:36.534 --> 15:38.401
The new...

15:39.634 --> 15:41.867
AllantÃ©.

15:42.167 --> 15:45.034
That was my bounce.

15:45.601 --> 15:46.834
Ah.

15:46.868 --> 15:49.066
Don't do anything, huh?

15:49.100 --> 15:50.733
Well, we'll see.

15:50.767 --> 15:54.034
I'll break him.
I'll break him.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.467
How about you, boy?

15:56.501 --> 15:59.500
Mommy does things
for you, doesn't she?

15:59.534 --> 16:01.467
<i>You're not my mommy.</i>

16:01.501 --> 16:04.567
<i>My mother has six nipples
and would lick my belly.</i>

16:07.601 --> 16:10.934
You're the only one
who understands.

16:13.467 --> 16:15.700
Hey, Peg.

16:15.734 --> 16:17.166
You still on strike?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.099
What does it look like?

16:19.133 --> 16:22.867
You could be on fire
and I wouldn't know.

16:22.901 --> 16:25.200
This has been the best
two weeks of my life.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.900
You know, the uncertainty
is gone.

16:26.934 --> 16:29.467
Accepting your utter uselessness
has freed me.

16:29.501 --> 16:31.166
Since I've been
taking care of myself,

16:31.200 --> 16:33.567
the food's better,
the conversation is better,

16:33.601 --> 16:36.800
and-- And without sex,
my hair's comin' back.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.867
It's not coming back, honey.

16:42.901 --> 16:45.999
It's just growing up
out of your nose.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.433
Ah, Peg.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.999
Would it really
make you feel better

16:49.033 --> 16:50.366
if I told you I needed you?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.034
Yes, it would.

16:59.467 --> 17:01.800
Well, I don't.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.600
I got my food.
Got my drink.

17:03.634 --> 17:06.233
In a few minutes,
I got my ball game.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.934
Uh-oh.

17:07.968 --> 17:09.333
Remote.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.333
Peg?

17:10.367 --> 17:12.800
Yes, sweetheart?

17:12.834 --> 17:15.165
Ball game's coming on
in a few minutes.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.333
Where's the remote control?

17:17.367 --> 17:19.867
You mean
your shootin' iron?

17:19.901 --> 17:22.266
Your magic wand?

17:22.300 --> 17:25.001
The only way you
could turn anything on?

17:26.400 --> 17:27.633
Yes.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.033
Have you seen it?

17:29.067 --> 17:32.867
Well, you know, sweetheart, yes,
as a matter of fact, I have.

17:32.901 --> 17:34.767
And I would love to tell you
where it is,

17:34.801 --> 17:37.533
but, gee, I can't.

17:37.567 --> 17:39.767
I'm on strike.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.867
Fine. Don't need it.

17:42.901 --> 17:45.001
I'll watch TV without it.

17:45.701 --> 17:47.533
There, game's on.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.533
<i>We'll be back with the kickoff
after these messages.</i>

17:50.567 --> 17:52.667
Mm.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.500
<i>We'll be back
with the second half</i>

17:58.534 --> 18:00.567
<i>after these messages.</i>

18:00.601 --> 18:02.200
<i>I'm an active gal.</i>

18:02.234 --> 18:05.034
<i>And as such,
I need maximum protection.</i>

18:10.067 --> 18:11.867
It's fine.
I don't need it.

18:11.901 --> 18:13.400
I'm happy.

18:13.434 --> 18:15.401
I have everything else.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.533
I don't need TV.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.867
How long has it been?

18:26.901 --> 18:28.567
It's been 10 seconds.

18:28.601 --> 18:30.567
All right, Peg. I give up.

18:30.601 --> 18:32.600
I'll do anything.

18:32.634 --> 18:35.101
Give me what I need,
baby!

18:37.567 --> 18:40.366
Give me
my remote control!

18:40.400 --> 18:43.600
And what will Daddy
give Mommy?

18:43.634 --> 18:45.433
Well, I already told you
I needed you.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.167
What else do you want?

18:48.267 --> 18:50.267
Aagh! No!

18:51.467 --> 18:53.867
Oh, Peg, it's light out,
for God's sake.

18:53.901 --> 18:57.667
We'll be able to see each other!
You know I hate that!

18:57.701 --> 18:59.133
But, honey,

18:59.167 --> 19:00.999
we wouldn't want anything
to happen

19:01.033 --> 19:03.166
to your remote control,
would we?

19:03.200 --> 19:05.900
Okay, honey.
Just a quickie, okay?

19:05.934 --> 19:08.633
No. I want the full
minute and a half.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.266
But, Peg--
Peg.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.233
And I want
the shoes off.

19:12.267 --> 19:14.533
Oh, God!

19:19.234 --> 19:21.133
How could she know
about "the Bundy bounce"?

19:21.167 --> 19:23.366
I mean, the only one who knew
besides me was you.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.368
How could she find out?

19:30.133 --> 19:32.266
Well, we may as well face it.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.301
We may never be able
to piece this thing together.

19:39.901 --> 19:41.200
Hi, kids.

19:41.234 --> 19:44.099
Did you know your father
is hanging from the window,

19:44.133 --> 19:47.033
butt bare to the world,
screaming for help?

19:47.067 --> 19:49.099
That's okay.
Mom's with him.

19:49.133 --> 19:50.600
Well, if you'll excuse me,

19:50.634 --> 19:53.166
someone stole an idea from me
and cost me a modeling job.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.733
So I'm going to handle this

19:54.767 --> 19:57.201
the only way that us Bundys
know how.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.001
With swift
and blinding violence.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.266
No, no. Now, wait a minute,
young lady.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.400
If you've got a problem

20:05.434 --> 20:07.066
you think you can solve
with violence,

20:07.100 --> 20:09.133
don't you think you should
talk to your parents?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.934
You can run,

20:10.968 --> 20:13.467
but you can't hide!

20:13.501 --> 20:15.700
Oh, Peg! Oh, no!

20:17.267 --> 20:18.867
Could I perhaps help
in any way?

20:18.901 --> 20:21.700
Well, you could wait outside
with the engine running.

20:21.734 --> 20:23.266
No, Kelly,

20:23.300 --> 20:24.800
haven't you ever
heard the phrase,

20:24.834 --> 20:26.400
"You can catch more
flies with honey

20:26.434 --> 20:27.733
than you can
with vinegar"?

20:27.767 --> 20:29.033
But if you pull their wings off,

20:29.067 --> 20:30.834
they'll eat whatever
you give them. Bye.

20:30.868 --> 20:32.033
No, Kelly, wait.

20:32.067 --> 20:33.533
Let me put this another way.

20:33.567 --> 20:36.133
You're a woman now,
not a child.

20:36.167 --> 20:39.300
You should solve your problems
in the mature, sophisticated way

20:39.334 --> 20:40.333
of the adult.

20:40.367 --> 20:43.434
Call 911!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

20:50.234 --> 20:53.900
And if your parents
were adults

20:53.934 --> 20:56.066
instead of stick figures,

20:56.100 --> 20:58.099
I'm sure they would agree
with me.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.400
So my advice to you
would be to go this person,

21:00.434 --> 21:02.700
<i>and appeal to her
sense of fairness.</i>

21:02.734 --> 21:04.467
<i>Explain how much
she hurt you.</i>

21:04.501 --> 21:08.133
<i>And she'll respond
to your maturity with maturity.</i>

21:08.167 --> 21:10.033
<i>For women, unlike men,</i>

21:10.067 --> 21:12.099
<i>have the capacity to feel.</i>

21:12.133 --> 21:13.834
<i>We talk things out.</i>

21:13.868 --> 21:16.033
<i>And when you tell her
a cheater never wins</i>

21:16.067 --> 21:18.934
<i>and a winner never cheats,
she'll give you that job back.</i>

21:22.567 --> 21:25.366
<i>And now, the car of tomorrow.</i>

21:25.400 --> 21:29.034
The new AllantÃ©.

21:35.734 --> 21:38.967
<i>Now, please follow me
to our next exhibit.</i>

21:39.400 --> 21:41.066
Thank you so much.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.366
Well, congratulations,
Miss Bundy.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.600
But, uh, what happened
to Miss Bauman?

21:45.634 --> 21:46.800
Oh, stage fight.

21:46.834 --> 21:48.633
I mean, uh, fright.

21:49.667 --> 21:50.966
Well,
congratulations.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.267
Thank you.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.966
Oh, Bud...

21:55.000 --> 21:57.567
I came. I saw. I bounced.

21:58.534 --> 21:59.999
Today, the AllantÃ© girl.

22:00.033 --> 22:03.600
Tomorrow,
slut in a Bon Jovi video.

22:06.067 --> 22:08.266
Reach for those stars,
eh, Kel?

22:08.300 --> 22:09.733
You should feel
pretty proud too.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.433
You didn't even
have to read your hand.

22:11.467 --> 22:13.733
Yeah, but now is a time
I have to read my hand

22:13.767 --> 22:15.867
'cause I wrote myself
a little note.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.567
It says,
"The one who..."

22:18.601 --> 22:20.266
Oh, what's that word?

22:20.300 --> 22:23.633
"Told about 'the Bundy bounce'
was...

22:23.667 --> 22:25.301
See other hand."
