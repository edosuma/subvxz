GINA: Previously on High School Musical:
The Musical: The Series...

00:05.255 --> 00:07.507
There's nothing like
your first time at summer camp.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.342
MADDOX: <i>What's up, new campers?</i>

00:09.426 --> 00:12.637
(SINGING) <i>Welcome to the Shallow Lake</i>
<i>of your dreams</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:17.851
With your first boyfriend
and your first true friends.

00:18.226 --> 00:21.104
Trying out for
the first student production of <i>Frozen.</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:23.648
I'm gonna be directing
the show about the show.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.275
Don't you have someone to do it?

00:25.358 --> 00:26.818
-Me?
-Mr. Director.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.612
What's next? My first earthquake?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.031
Bye, Salt Lake.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.408
-Nothing's gonna get in our way.
-Excuse me.

00:42.208 --> 00:47.088
Oh, my gosh. Is that EJ Caswell from
Disney+'s Frozen: The Musical: The Series?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.715
They would never call the show that.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.717
It's a way too long
and complicated a title.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.552
Thank you.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.513
Couldn't sleep?

00:55.764 --> 00:58.725
I figured I'd get a start
on panicking early, you know,

00:58.808 --> 01:00.685
seeing as I am now
the one who has to direct

01:00.769 --> 01:03.438
the first-ever student production
of <i>Frozen</i> that will air in,

01:03.521 --> 01:04.689
I don't know, 63 countries?

01:04.898 --> 01:07.776
Well, I am not panicking at all.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.527
You're gonna be the best director

01:09.611 --> 01:12.363
Camp Shallow Lake
and those 63 countries has ever seen.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.866
You literally have zero proof
to back that theory up.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.951
I'm sorry. Can I just
believe in the potential

01:17.035 --> 01:20.121
of my incredibly smart,
wildly talented boyfriend?

01:20.205 --> 01:21.289
You forgot handsome.

01:21.539 --> 01:27.045
You managed to be extremely humble
for about five seconds. It's a new record.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.090
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
I was kind of hoping

01:30.173 --> 01:32.675
me and EJ would get
to play leads together.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.428
You know, continue
the romance into the showmance.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.683
Hey. You know, at least this way,
I'll get a good part.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.269
Can you believe Ricky showed up?

01:43.353 --> 01:46.481
When are you gonna tell
everyone you're directing the show?

01:47.232 --> 01:49.609
Soon, at auditions,

01:50.777 --> 01:54.572
but will you not say anything until then?

02:00.495 --> 02:01.913
(BUGLE PLAYING)

02:02.413 --> 02:03.665
EJ: Hey-o!

02:03.748 --> 02:07.794
-I'm so glad you're hearing the bugle.
-A what?

02:10.463 --> 02:12.674
It's like the perfect start to the day.

02:14.175 --> 02:18.012
Rise and shine, newbies!
You're on Shallow Lake time now. Whoo!

02:19.514 --> 02:20.723
Oh, hey, guys.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.058
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

02:30.191 --> 02:31.317
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

02:34.070 --> 02:35.989
(WARBLING)

02:39.868 --> 02:41.619
(MAKES WHINY NOISE)

02:44.038 --> 02:47.083
Nothing like waking up
to a face full of steam.

02:47.333 --> 02:52.547
Your bed is closest to the outlet.
Very prime setup. So, what's the deal?

02:52.630 --> 02:55.216
I thought you were gonna be
with young Cersei Lannister,

02:55.300 --> 02:59.137
jet skiing and sight-seeing
and terrorizing innocent townspeople.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.683
-Yeah, those plans are off.
-Do you wanna talk about it?

03:03.766 --> 03:07.353
-Not even a little.
-Me neither. I was just being polite.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.190
I cannot focus on anything
but auditions right now.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.527
Auditions? I wonder what I'll get.
Or what I want.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.739
What are the two main guys' names
in <i>Frozen</i> again?

03:17.822 --> 03:22.744
Look, Ricky, I know at school you always
somehow fall backwards into a lead role,

03:22.827 --> 03:25.455
but you can't Zefron
your way through auditions this time.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.831
I'm not gonna Zefron.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.503
Fine. I'll learn the two guys' names.

03:33.379 --> 03:37.091
One is... I wanna say Gary.

03:37.508 --> 03:41.888
None of them are Gary. There are no Garys.
It's freaking Norway, Ricky.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.182
I'm kidding. I know their names.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.018
I've seen the 2013
smash hit movie, <i>Frozen.</i>

03:48.853 --> 03:52.315
It's summer, Carlos.
We're supposed to have fun.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.776
Fun is for the ensemble.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.947
(SHUDDERS) Uh...

03:59.030 --> 04:00.448
Carlos?

04:00.740 --> 04:04.744
CARLOS: That's Jet. I don't think he's
slept or spoken in the last 24 hours.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.955
There's a high chance he's the Babadook.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.167
Hey, little guy.

04:15.713 --> 04:19.801
I can't believe we're actually
gonna be in this documentary.

04:19.884 --> 04:24.013
And to be directed
by Mr. Chad Danforth himself.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.642
Okay, one could say the stakes
for auditions have never been higher.

04:27.725 --> 04:31.396
And one will. I will.
The stakes have never been higher.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.398
I think I'm having withdrawals.

04:33.481 --> 04:37.068
I mean, this is the first day I haven't
had a headache in my entire life.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.653
Isn't that a good thing?

04:38.736 --> 04:41.239
No. I don't know who I am without screens.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.035
So, camp's a little more rustic
than I thought it would be.

04:46.119 --> 04:50.665
But hey. Aren't we all entitled to
a little bit of drama on audition day?

04:50.748 --> 04:51.791
(LAUGHS)

04:53.418 --> 04:57.088
Do either of you have
a phone on you? (CHUCKLES)

04:57.171 --> 05:00.842
Can I just hold it? Just for a second.

05:02.802 --> 05:06.306
I'm just gonna let it be known that
I'm going for gold at auditions today.

05:06.389 --> 05:11.519
I'm finally ready to play the lead.
No apologies, no prisoners.

05:11.686 --> 05:16.441
-Sounds like you brought Gina 1.0 to camp.
-No.

05:16.524 --> 05:20.987
Look, okay, I loved auditioning
with you guys last year,

05:21.070 --> 05:22.822
and we're still a tercet,

05:23.656 --> 05:26.909
but I just feel like I need to stand
on my own this summer, you know?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.995
Especially with
the whole documentary thing.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.331
Like, that could literally be our future.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.751
Okay, 1.0.

05:36.878 --> 05:37.920

-(BOTH CHUCKLE NERVOUSLY)

08:12.658 --> 08:13.659
Yeah.

08:16.078 --> 08:19.290
I was just gonna grab
some breakfast before auditions.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.209
Same here. Twinsies.

-Should I just...

08:27.131 --> 08:29.008
-No, you first.
-(LAUGHS)

08:30.051 --> 08:33.137
Can we just start over?

Yes. Definitely.

(WARBLING)

08:37.934 --> 08:38.976
Twinsies.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.271
No, Ricky,
that's what I was trying to say.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.483
Can the two of us start over?

08:47.318 --> 08:48.736
Duh. Right.

(LAUGHS)

08:58.120 --> 09:01.582
Okay, we're in a new place,
and we're different people now.

09:02.291 --> 09:07.463
We can start fresh.
No drama, no chocolates.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.798
(CHUCKLES)

09:10.174 --> 09:15.638
-Summer's supposed to be fun, right?
-Yes. I totally agree. Summer of fun.

09:22.937 --> 09:26.190
CAROL: Wow, back in LA,
where it all began.

09:27.483 --> 09:32.697
We are definitely not old enough to be
going to our 20-year college reunion.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.949
-I still feel like I'm 18.
-Which makes no sense.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.493
Because 18-year-olds
couldn't possibly have a daughter

09:37.577 --> 09:39.453
who's also about to turn 18.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.122
Never do the math.

09:46.210 --> 09:50.089
Hey, baby.
Do you remember our friend, Marvin?

09:50.965 --> 09:53.718
Sure. I loved that guy,
when I was, like, four.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.471
-Why?
-Do you remember when you were young

09:57.555 --> 10:00.474
and you once asked about
the donor we used for you

10:00.558 --> 10:03.227
and I told you that
it was a stranger, but...

10:03.311 --> 10:04.312
It was Marvin.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.939
Oh.

10:07.023 --> 10:12.862
Now, this can be as big or as small
of a deal as you want it to be.

10:12.945 --> 10:13.946
Totally.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.491
I just thought maybe he could come over,
hang out here at the rental with us,

10:17.575 --> 10:20.244
-have some dinner before the reunion...
-Just like a chill hang.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.204
If you want, though. If you want.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.207
Sure. I mean, it's not like
I haven't already met him.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.793
We just want you
to meet Marvin again as an adult.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.129
-Or an almost adult.
-Yeah.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.798
-Maybe you guys will bond. You never know.
-All right. Okay.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.967
Okay, yes. Okay, thanks, honey.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.476
(SIGHS)

10:50.524 --> 10:53.611
Okay, I will say, for a barn, wow.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.991
-MADDOX: Everyone should start warming up.
-Man, am I psyched for auditions.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.452
Maybe we'll get to play
the male leads together again, huh?

11:01.535 --> 11:07.083
Those guys. There's two of them.
They're friends? Enemies? Lovers?

11:08.751 --> 11:09.877
There she is.

11:19.804 --> 11:24.558
That's Val. Eight-time Shallow Lake camper
and current Shallow Lake CIT.

11:24.642 --> 11:28.270
-Yeah, she and EJ go way back.
-Yeah, they seem close.

11:28.479 --> 11:32.441
Yeah. They were Gretl and Kurt together
in <i>The Sound of Music</i> way back in the day.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.944
That kind of bond is forever.

11:37.822 --> 11:43.536
Hey, everyone. I'm Val,
and not too long ago, I was just like you,

11:43.619 --> 11:46.580
waiting in the wings
for my chance at stardom.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.750
Then I went to college
and my dreams of Broadway

11:49.834 --> 11:52.586
were instantly dashed
by my Intro-To-Movement professor,

11:52.670 --> 11:55.089
who said I wasn't convincing
as a human being.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.465
(LAUGHS)

11:57.925 --> 11:58.926
Wow.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.471
But now I'm a psych major.
And I'm also your choreographer.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.057
The director will kick off
the auditions in just a moment.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.268
Corbin Bleu. Whoo!

12:11.063 --> 12:12.064
What's up?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.024
Ow!

12:14.108 --> 12:17.111
EJ, come on. You need to tell everyone
you're directing the show.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.447
Ashlyn won't stop talking
about how she's gonna be

12:19.530 --> 12:22.199
singing while gazing into
Corbin Bleu's beautiful brown eyes.

12:22.283 --> 12:28.789
I will tell everyone. In a second.
I just need a second. So, in two seconds.

12:36.964 --> 12:41.761
Hey, Maddox. I wanted to offer my services
in hair-and-makeup.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.971
Obvi, I'll be auditioning too.
But back at East...

12:44.054 --> 12:45.264
I've got it covered.

12:46.307 --> 12:49.769
You don't want any help? I mean,
teamwork makes the dream work, right?

12:49.852 --> 12:53.731
I've always done it myself.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.650
We can go back and forth
with phrases like this all day.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.735
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

13:08.120 --> 13:12.082
So, the thing about me is that people
sometimes call me an "acquired taste."

13:12.166 --> 13:16.253
Which is a fancy way of saying
I'm not for everyone.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.715
Which I pretend I'm fine with.
Like, it makes me cool or something.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.718
But it actually kinda hurts my feelings.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.346
There was this whole group of crew kids

13:25.429 --> 13:27.723
that I used to hang out with
at Shallow Lake.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.476
One in particular.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.521
But they've moved on, and it's just been

13:33.604 --> 13:36.398
so long since I've
had to make new friends, I just...

13:37.691 --> 13:40.528
I don't quite know
what I'm doing this summer.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.990
(SINGING SOFTLY)
<i>Do you wanna build a snow...</i>

13:45.616 --> 13:48.244
Don't mind me. I'm just grabbing a prop.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.749
You like it? Sort of 1980s mom-in-a-mall.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.171
Hey. Didn't know
how cold it was gonna get.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.590
It's California, man.

14:02.174 --> 14:06.262
-He speaks. Do you sing?
-Not anymore.

14:12.977 --> 14:13.978
Hi, Gina.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.481
Play it cool. Sorry.
I'm Alex, this is Emmy.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.526
We're eighth graders,
almost freshmen, and we are huge fans.

14:20.609 --> 14:25.114
-We basically memorized all your TikToks.
-Yeah. You played it very cool.

14:25.197 --> 14:29.326
-Are you both auditioning?
-Yes. Well, maybe.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.579
We've never
auditioned for anything before.

14:31.954 --> 14:36.876
Well, definitely be prepared. Practice.
And you have to be confident.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.670
If you don't feel confident,
just fake confidence.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.548
Fake confidence.
Love that for us. Keep going.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.050
And you have to keep
your eye on the prize.

14:45.134 --> 14:49.138
From this moment on, you two aren't
even friends. You're the competition.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.185
What'd I tell you? Gina 1.0.

14:57.146 --> 15:03.068
I think I got it. So, Corbin Bleu is only
directing the TV show about the show.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.404
-Correct.
-Now you have to direct the actual show?

15:05.487 --> 15:09.033
-The only ones who know are you and Gina.
-What happened to Nini?

15:09.116 --> 15:12.536
Shy girl from last summer,
weird British accent when she's nervous.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.039
-Yeah, it's been a long year, Val.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:15.122 --> 15:17.333
Look. I'll help you.

15:22.004 --> 15:26.425
Like, for instance,
maybe I should cast the show. Alone.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.802
Wait. No, that's the one thing
I was excited about.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.972
Bias is a thing. Your subjectivity
could affect the results.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.934
If you're such a pro,
maybe you wanna direct the show too?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.143
Nice try.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.188
Act like you know what you're doing.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.776
Yo. We are ready.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.279
It is time to introduce you
to your director,

15:49.114 --> 15:51.992
Rocket Man himself, EJ Caswell.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.203
(ALL CLAPPING HESITANTLY)

15:58.123 --> 16:00.125

16:01.043 --> 16:04.421
-Act.
-No Corbin Bleu?

16:05.130 --> 16:08.717
Oh, yeah. He's directing a show
about the show. It's confusing.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.302
Circle up.

16:17.810 --> 16:24.775
(SINGING) <i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

Where's Mr. Bleu?

16:40.541 --> 16:41.709
What are you doing in here?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.378
You can't be in your bunk
during elective periods. It's dangerous.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.463
We could be dusting.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.048
(SCOFFS)

16:50.300 --> 16:54.388
Hmm. Looks like you
haven't signed up for any electives.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.641
Looks like swimming
still has one spot open.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.477
Actually, I'm allergic to chlorine.

17:01.061 --> 17:04.064
Well, then it's a summer
of exposure therapy for you.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.775
Unless you plan
on trying out for the musical.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.113
-Are those literally my only two options?
-Yes. Literally.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.782
Look, I didn't come here
to sing in a barn.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.494
Well, Jet, then why did you come here?

17:19.663 --> 17:23.000
And while you're thinking about that,
don't make me take away your screen.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.758
Yeah, we're gonna need
another bunk check in 10.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.891
Okay, everyone.
Let's take some grounding breaths.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.643
And we're off!

17:41.727 --> 17:45.439
For those of you who I technically know,
today, you're not Wildcats.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.692
Today, you're a bunch of blank canvases,
strangers to me.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.195
-Today, we've never met.
-Maybe don't talk.

Have you seen any celebrities or...

21:03.595 --> 21:07.891
You know what? I thought I saw
an influencer, but it was just a barista.

-No. You stay.

I'm thinking it too.

It's crazy how much we look alike.

I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
So, do you play any sports or...

21:42.092 --> 21:46.221
Uh, not unless you count Little League
in second grade, which I was terrible at.

21:46.305 --> 21:52.269
Oh, I was thinking it might be genetic.
I played baseball in college, and...

21:52.936 --> 21:56.732

at the same time. Three, two, one.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.162
-Green?
-Black.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.415
Well, see? I mean, that's not so far off.

both colors are visible.

And what was the band named?

that I'm totally and completely
drowning up here.

27:54.089 --> 27:58.051
Oh, my gosh. You are not drowning.
Just maybe no more acting.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.929
-Just be yourself.
-Duh. I don't think anyone wants that.

28:01.930 --> 28:07.394
Miss Jenns aren't built in a day.
You'll be great, and you have help, right?

28:07.894 --> 28:11.690
-You have Val.
-Yeah, Val's the best.

28:13.817 --> 28:17.320
Seriously, EJ, if you're too stressed
about directing this summer,

28:17.404 --> 28:19.864
I don't wanna give you
something else to be worried about,

28:19.948 --> 28:22.325
so maybe you and I should
just play it cool...

28:22.409 --> 28:23.576
-Hey.
-What?

28:24.119 --> 28:26.830
You and me, it's the only thing
I'm not worried about.

28:28.873 --> 28:32.127
But maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea
if we kept

28:32.210 --> 28:34.129
a professional distance at rehearsals.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.882
Yeah. Several feet apart. No hand holding.

28:37.966 --> 28:43.096
-Definitely no meaningful eye contact.
-You mean, like this?

28:45.181 --> 28:47.142
(LAUGHS) Yes.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.227
-Are we going to the pool?
-Wanna take a swim?

28:49.310 --> 28:51.104
-Yeah.
-Why not?

28:51.563 --> 28:53.857
-Beat you there.
-No, you won't.

28:56.526 --> 29:01.448
I just cannot believe University Clowns
almost played the first ever Coachella.

29:01.531 --> 29:04.659
-Like, I'm losing it.
-Almost.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.913
But I can't believe you,
working with Jamie Porter.

29:09.539 --> 29:13.084
That kid's the real deal. I mean,
you must be pretty impressive.

29:13.918 --> 29:17.922
Look, whatever happens,
I hope you don't stop writing songs.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.425
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.510
-(PHONE CHIMES)
-Oh!

29:22.969 --> 29:26.765
Okay. I'm sorry.
I have to break up this reunion.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.933
I have to go to this
other reunion with your moms.

29:29.642 --> 29:32.353
-Of course.
-Just gonna grab my wallet from the car.

29:32.437 --> 29:36.065
Oh, my car is black, by the way.
Your favorite color.

29:36.149 --> 29:41.279
Not green. So I don't know.
Maybe we really are related.

29:41.362 --> 29:42.989
(CHUCKLES) All right.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.241
I, uh...

29:45.325 --> 29:47.786
I remember what
it was like to be your age.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.539
Everything seems unpredictable.

29:51.998 --> 29:57.712
But I promise you, Nini,
the best is yet to come.

30:00.757 --> 30:07.639
I'm really glad we got to meet again.
I was afraid it might throw you off.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.433
(CHUCKLES) I'm not thrown.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.437
All right. (CHUCKLES)

33:20.289 --> 33:22.458
Hey, did Maddox ever
come back after dinner?

33:22.542 --> 33:25.169
She probably has some super-top-secret

33:25.253 --> 33:27.547
important camp tradition
business to attend to.

33:27.630 --> 33:31.843
Is it bad to say she's kind of a lot?

33:31.926 --> 33:35.805
And that's coming from me,
someone who is also a lot.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.641
Come on, you guys. Maddox is great.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.185
She just wants all of us to bond
and be friends

33:41.269 --> 33:43.688
and go along with her cool rituals.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.482
ASHLYN AND KOURTNEY: Mmm-hmm

33:47.108 --> 33:48.818
Guys, she's harmless.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.097
CARLOS: Cast list.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.143
No, no, no.

34:26.856 --> 34:27.982
Not on my watch.
