>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:36.166 --> 00:37.767
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:37.834 --> 00:41.300
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:41.367 --> 00:41.900
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:41.967 --> 00:42.767
US.

00:42.834 --> 00:43.367
AND WE BEGIN WITH YET ANOTHER

00:43.433 --> 00:47.200
DEVELOPMENT IN THE ONGOING

00:47.266 --> 00:48.033
SCANDAL WE'VE BEEN CALLING

00:48.100 --> 00:48.767
"STUPID WATERGATE."

00:48.834 --> 00:49.567
LIKE WATERGATE, EXCEPT INSTEAD

00:49.633 --> 00:50.433
OF INSPIRING OSCAR-WINNING

00:50.500 --> 00:51.066
MOVIES, IT'LL EVENTUALLY BE THE

00:51.133 --> 00:51.900
BASIS OF DIRECT-TO-CABLE

00:51.967 --> 00:53.233
COMEDIES FEATURING FART JOKES

00:53.300 --> 00:54.266
AND LARRY THE CABLE GUY.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.400
AND WITH INVESTIGATORS SEEMINGLY

00:55.467 --> 01:03.800
CLOSING IN ON MULTIPLE FRONTS,

01:03.867 --> 01:05.700
THE PRESIDENT, THIS WEEK, WAS

01:05.767 --> 01:06.133
APPARENTLY WORRIED.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.066
>> NEW REPORT FROM

01:07.133 --> 01:08.266
"THE WASHINGTON POST" THIS

01:08.333 --> 01:08.767
MORNING SAYS THINGS ARE

01:08.834 --> 01:09.400
UNRAVELING BEHIND THE SCENES FOR

01:09.467 --> 01:10.300
THE PRESIDENT WHO FEARS FOR HIS

01:10.367 --> 01:11.133
SON DONALD TRUMP JR.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.066
A SOURCE TELLS THE "POST" HE

01:12.133 --> 01:14.433
DOES NOT BELIEVE HIS SON BROKE

01:14.500 --> 01:18.433
THE LAW BUT IS FEARFUL HE

01:18.500 --> 01:19.300
INADVERTENTLY WANDERED INTO

01:19.367 --> 01:20.500
LEGAL JEOPARDY.

01:20.567 --> 01:24.967
>> John: YEP.

01:25.033 --> 01:25.567
THAT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE, TO BE

01:25.633 --> 01:26.867
HONEST.

01:26.934 --> 01:27.467
ON THE LONG LIST OF

01:27.533 --> 01:28.767
"THINGS DON JR. IS LIKELY TO

01:28.834 --> 01:29.367
WANDER INTO," "LEGAL JEOPARDY"

01:29.433 --> 01:30.700
IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH

01:30.767 --> 01:31.700
"THE WOMEN'S DRESSING ROOM" AND

01:31.767 --> 01:33.867
"A SCREEN DOOR."

01:33.934 --> 01:36.600
TRUMP WAS FIRING BACK ON TWITTER

01:36.667 --> 01:39.133
JUST THIS MORNING, SAYING, "FAKE

01:39.200 --> 01:40.033
NEWS REPORTING A COMPLETE

01:40.100 --> 01:41.133
FABRICATION THAT I AM CONCERNED

01:41.200 --> 01:42.767
ABOUT THE MEETING MY WONDERFUL

01:42.834 --> 01:45.767
SON DONALD HAD IN TRUMP TOWER.

01:45.834 --> 01:46.533
THIS WAS A MEETING TO GET

01:46.600 --> 01:47.467
INFORMATION ON AN OPPONENT,

01:47.533 --> 01:48.433
TOTALLY LEGAL AND DONE ALL THE

01:48.500 --> 01:49.967
TIME IN POLITICS, AND IT WENT

01:50.033 --> 01:52.233
NOWHERE.

01:52.300 --> 01:52.934
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT."

01:53.000 --> 01:53.900
THERE IS SO MUCH WRONG THERE,

01:53.967 --> 01:56.367
FROM THE FACT IT UNDERMINES THE

01:56.433 --> 01:57.266
EXCUSE HE SUPPOSEDLY DICTATED,

01:57.333 --> 01:58.133
THAT THIS MEETING WAS ABOUT

01:58.200 --> 01:59.467
RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS, TO CLAIMING

01:59.533 --> 02:00.800
HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT, AND IF

02:00.867 --> 02:01.900
HE DID, NOTHING HAPPENED, AND IF

02:01.967 --> 02:03.400
IT WASN'T, HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

02:03.467 --> 02:05.066
IT.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.066
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST GALLING LIE

02:06.133 --> 02:07.667
IN THERE IS DESCRIBING

02:07.734 --> 02:16.300
DONALD JR. AS A "WONDERFUL SON."

02:16.367 --> 02:17.934
I MEAN, THAT IS JUST FLAGRANTLY

02:18.000 --> 02:19.400
FALSE.

02:19.467 --> 02:20.367
HE'S BARELY EVEN THE MOST

02:20.433 --> 02:21.233
WONDERFUL DONALD TRUMP.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.000
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY LEGAL

02:22.066 --> 02:22.800
CASE THE PRESIDENT WAS FOLLOWING

02:22.867 --> 02:23.633
THIS WEEK.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.000
THERE'S ALSO THE TRIAL OF

02:25.066 --> 02:25.600
PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP'S FORMER

02:25.667 --> 02:26.767
CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND A MAN WHO

02:26.834 --> 02:28.166
COULD BE CONVICTED OF EVERY

02:28.233 --> 02:29.533
SINGLE CRIME ON EARTH AND STILL

02:29.600 --> 02:32.166
NOT BE AS GUILTY AS HE LOOKS.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.900
NOW, THIS WEEK, MANAFORT WAS IN

02:33.967 --> 02:37.100
COURT, WHERE HE'S BEEN CHARGED

02:37.166 --> 02:37.934
WITH EVERYTHING FROM MONEY

02:38.000 --> 02:39.734
LAUNDERING TO TAX EVASION TO

02:39.800 --> 02:40.934
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE TO BANK

02:41.000 --> 02:42.700
FRAUD.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.800
HE'S CURRENTLY CHARGED WITH

02:44.867 --> 02:45.834
32 COUNTS, OR AS THEY CALL IT,

02:45.900 --> 02:47.100
"A MOBSTER'S DOZEN," AND IT'S

02:47.166 --> 02:47.734
SOMETHING THAT TRUMP SEES AS AN

02:47.800 --> 02:49.200
OUTRAGE.

02:49.266 --> 02:51.333
>> TRUMP TWEETING, "LOOKING BACK

02:51.400 --> 02:52.066
ON HISTORY, WHO WAS TREATED

02:52.133 --> 02:55.467
WORSE, ALFONSE CAPONE, LEGENDARY

02:55.533 --> 02:56.667
MOB BOSS, KILLER, AND

02:56.734 --> 02:57.700
"PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE," OR

02:57.767 --> 02:59.066
PAUL MANAFORT, POLITICAL

02:59.133 --> 02:59.800
OPERATIVE AND REAGAN/DOLE

02:59.867 --> 03:01.000
DARLING, NOW SERVING SOLITARY

03:01.066 --> 03:02.233
CONFINEMENT ALTHOUGH CONVICTED

03:02.300 --> 03:08.533
OF NOTHING?"

03:08.600 --> 03:09.633
>> John: WHAT?

03:09.700 --> 03:10.934
SO BROADLY, I THINK THE ARGUMENT

03:11.000 --> 03:11.567
THERE IS, PAUL MANAFORT IS LESS

03:11.633 --> 03:12.867
OF A CRIMINAL THAN AMERICA'S

03:12.934 --> 03:14.233
MOST FAMOUS CRIMINAL, WHICH IS

03:14.300 --> 03:15.400
SURELY THE MOST DARING LEGAL

03:15.467 --> 03:16.734
STRATEGY SINCE JOHNNY COCHRAN'S

03:16.800 --> 03:18.567
QUICKLY ABANDONED "OH, RELAX,

03:18.633 --> 03:19.533
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S HITLER!"

03:19.600 --> 03:21.533
DEFENSE.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.800
"IF HE'S NOT HITLER, YOU MUST

03:22.867 --> 03:25.367
ACQUIT-LER."

03:25.433 --> 03:26.967
NOW, THE PROSECUTION --

03:27.033 --> 03:28.900
BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.233
THE PROSECUTION SPENT TIME

03:30.300 --> 03:31.433
PRESENTING EVIDENCE OF

03:31.500 --> 03:34.133
MANAFORT'S LAVISH LIFESTYLE,

03:34.200 --> 03:35.233
WITH SOME TANTALIZING DETAILS,

03:35.300 --> 03:37.567
FROM A $10,000 KARAOKE SYSTEM TO

03:37.633 --> 03:39.533
SPENDING $450,000 ON LANDSCAPING

03:39.600 --> 03:41.667
HIS HAMPTONS HOUSE, INCLUDING

03:41.734 --> 03:42.633
BOTH A MAN-MADE WATERFALL AND, I

03:42.700 --> 03:45.567
QUOTE, "ONE RED FLOWER BED IN

03:45.633 --> 03:47.333
THE SHAPE OF AN 'M.'"

03:47.400 --> 03:49.734
NOW, IN MANAFORT'S DEFENSE,

03:49.800 --> 03:51.166
MAYBE IT WASN'T ACTUALLY AN "M"

03:51.233 --> 03:51.734
FOR "MANAFORT."

03:51.800 --> 03:52.767
MAYBE HE WAS STILL SAVING UP FOR

03:52.834 --> 03:58.500
THE "NIGHT SHYAMALAN."

03:58.567 --> 03:59.100
THAT WOULD BE A BOLD PIECE OF

03:59.166 --> 03:59.967
BOTANY.

04:00.033 --> 04:01.333
BUT MOST OF THE ATTENTION ON

04:01.400 --> 04:01.934
MANAFORT'S SPENDING FOCUSED ON

04:02.000 --> 04:02.567
THE $1.3 MILLION HE SUPPOSEDLY

04:02.633 --> 04:03.533
SPENT ON CLOTHES BETWEEN 2010

04:03.600 --> 04:05.333
AND 2014.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.767
AND HIS TASTE WAS TRULY

04:06.834 --> 04:08.100
SPECTACULAR.

04:08.166 --> 04:10.066
>> IN APRIL 2012, MANAFORT PAID

04:10.133 --> 04:13.166
$18,500 FOR A PYTHON JACKET.

04:13.233 --> 04:17.200
JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER, IT

04:17.266 --> 04:18.834
WAS $9,500 ON AN OSTRICH VEST TO

04:18.900 --> 04:20.433
APPARENTLY COMPLEMENT THE

04:20.500 --> 04:22.266
OSTRICH JACKET HE LATER PAID

04:22.333 --> 04:25.400
$15,000 FOR.

04:25.467 --> 04:26.800
>> John: $24,000 ON AN OSTRICH

04:26.867 --> 04:28.700
OUTFIT.

04:28.767 --> 04:33.767
THAT IS RIDICULOUS WHEN YOU CAN

04:33.834 --> 04:38.033
FIND ONE ONLINE FOR $55.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.667
AND, LOOK, IF YOU'RE THINKING

04:40.734 --> 04:42.000
"HOLD ON, MAYBE WHEN YOU SEE THE

04:42.066 --> 04:43.100
JACKET, IT'S WORTH IT," I'LL

04:43.166 --> 04:44.100
SHOW YOU.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.133
IT FUCKING ISN'T.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.033
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,

04:46.100 --> 04:47.166
BUT THAT LOOKED BETTER ON THE

04:47.233 --> 04:48.400
OSTRICH.

04:48.467 --> 04:49.533
THAT IS A LEATHER JACKET FOR

04:49.600 --> 04:50.734
PEOPLE WHO ALSO HAVE A

04:50.800 --> 04:51.567
SUBSCRIPTION TO

04:51.633 --> 04:53.000
"READER'S DIGEST."

04:53.066 --> 04:54.300
IT'S WHAT THE FONZ WOULD WEAR ON

04:54.367 --> 04:55.400
THE DAYS HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE

04:55.467 --> 04:56.767
FUCKING.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.367
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS, THIS THING

04:58.433 --> 04:59.567
ACTUALLY HAS A HOOD.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.700
A HOOD.

05:01.767 --> 05:03.633
YOU KNOW, FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO

05:03.700 --> 05:06.166
WEAR YOUR $15,000 JACKET OUT IN

05:06.233 --> 05:09.033
THE RAIN.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.200
LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.533
NOW, THE JUDGE HAS MADE IT CLEAR

05:11.600 --> 05:13.200
THAT HE LIKELY WON'T ALLOW

05:13.266 --> 05:14.800
PICTURES OF MANAFORT'S CLOTHES

05:14.867 --> 05:17.834
TO BE SHOWN TO THE JURY, WHICH

05:17.900 --> 05:19.633
IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA, BECAUSE

05:19.700 --> 05:21.100
IF THEY SAW THIS, A JACKET THAT

05:21.166 --> 05:22.900
SCREAMS "I FRAMED ROGER RABBIT,"

05:22.967 --> 05:24.633
HE JUST WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.467
MANAFORT APPARENTLY BOUGHT MANY

05:25.533 --> 05:26.600
OF THESE ITEMS AT A STORE IN

05:26.667 --> 05:28.300
BEVERLY HILLS CALLED

05:28.367 --> 05:29.633
HOUSE OF BIJAN, WHICH ITSELF

05:29.700 --> 05:32.934
SOUNDS LIKE A PLACE WHERE YOU

05:33.000 --> 05:34.100
WOULD BUY KNOCK-OFF MUSTARD.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.433
"C'MON, MOM, YOU BOUGHT BIJAN

05:35.500 --> 05:38.166
AGAIN?

05:38.233 --> 05:39.567
JUST PAY THE EXTRA 50 CENTS!

05:39.633 --> 05:41.700
I HATE THIS."

05:41.767 --> 05:43.633
BUT HOUSE OF BIJAN IS,

05:43.700 --> 05:45.200
INCREDIBLY, SOMETHING FAR WORSE.

05:45.266 --> 05:46.467
JUST WATCH THE STORE'S

05:46.533 --> 05:47.633
26-YEAR-OLD CO-OWNER SHOW YOU

05:47.700 --> 05:52.834
ANOTHER PIECE.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.467
>> FOR EXAMPLE, THIS BEAUTIFUL

05:54.533 --> 05:55.467
SILK BLAZER IN WHITE.

05:55.533 --> 05:56.900
THERE'S ONLY ONE PIECE MADE.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.734
YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE BUTTONS

05:58.800 --> 06:01.166
OUR SILVER CREST.

06:01.233 --> 06:03.233
INSIDE IN PURE SILK WITH ALL ITS

06:03.300 --> 06:04.533
DETAILING BY HAND.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.300
AND, FOR EXAMPLE, THIS JACKET IS

06:06.367 --> 06:07.734
$12,000.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.166
>> John: OH, OKAY, SO, JUST SO I

06:11.233 --> 06:12.367
HAVE THIS STRAIGHT: THE JACKET

06:12.433 --> 06:14.033
COSTS $12,000 BECAUSE IT HAS

06:14.100 --> 06:17.700
BUTTONS AND A SILK LINING?

06:17.767 --> 06:18.667
I'LL SAY THIS.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.000
AT LEAST THE SHIT MANAFORT WAS

06:20.066 --> 06:20.700
BUYING WAS MADE OUT OF

06:20.767 --> 06:23.400
MURDERED SNAKES.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.667
BECAUSE THAT JACKET IS

06:25.734 --> 06:26.867
ESSENTIALLY $12,000 WORTH OF

06:26.934 --> 06:28.266
WORM VOMIT ORGANIZED INTO THE

06:28.333 --> 06:29.633
SHAPE OF A NAVAL UNIFORM WORN BY

06:29.700 --> 06:31.300
THE LOWEST-RANKING OFFICER ON

06:31.367 --> 06:32.500
THE SS NOUVEAU RICHE.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.667
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THIS CASE IS

06:33.734 --> 06:35.000
ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN MANAFORT'S

06:35.066 --> 06:37.200
SHITTY FASHION SENSE AND

06:37.266 --> 06:38.133
SHOPAHOLIC TENDENCIES.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.900
ALTHOUGH ONE THING IT ISN'T

06:39.967 --> 06:41.200
REALLY ABOUT IS THE 2016 TRUMP

06:41.266 --> 06:42.867
CAMPAIGN, SOMETHING THAT

06:42.934 --> 06:44.266
FOX NEWS HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING

06:44.333 --> 06:45.633
ALL WEEK.

06:45.700 --> 06:46.500
>> THE CHARGES HE'S BEEN BROUGHT

06:46.567 --> 06:47.867
AGAINST HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

06:47.934 --> 06:49.266
THE 2016 ELECTION.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.066
>> NO TALK THOUGH ABOUT RUSSIAN

06:50.133 --> 06:51.033
COLLUSION.

06:51.100 --> 06:57.900
NO MENTION OF THE PRESIDENT.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.367
>> THE CHARGES THAT MANAFORT IS

06:59.433 --> 07:00.633
NOW FACING HAVE NOTHING TO DO

07:00.700 --> 07:01.200
WITH TRUMP, NOTHING.

07:01.266 --> 07:02.266
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CAMPAIGN,

07:02.333 --> 07:02.633
ZERO.

07:02.700 --> 07:03.333
NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA, ZERO.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.700
NOTHING ABOUT COLLUSION.

07:05.767 --> 07:06.533
>> John: AND THAT'S TRUE ON ITS

07:06.600 --> 07:08.233
SURFACE.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.533
BUT THIS CASE IS ALSO NOT

07:09.600 --> 07:10.433
EXACTLY NOT ABOUT THE 2016

07:10.500 --> 07:12.734
CAMPAIGN EITHER.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.266
BECAUSE JUST THINK ABOUT IT:

07:14.333 --> 07:15.400
THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER

07:15.467 --> 07:17.133
ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED MILLIONS OF

07:17.200 --> 07:18.367
DOLLARS IN ILLICIT PAYMENTS FROM

07:18.433 --> 07:19.767
THUGGISH KREMLIN PUPPETS AND,

07:19.834 --> 07:20.734
DESPITE ALL THE MONEY HE SAVED

07:20.800 --> 07:22.066
BY NOT PAYING TAXES, HAD

07:22.133 --> 07:23.834
REPORTEDLY GONE BROKE SUPPORTING

07:23.900 --> 07:26.166
HIS CRIPPLING ADDICTION TO

07:26.233 --> 07:28.200
BAD JACKETS, YET FOR SOME REASON

07:28.266 --> 07:29.266
HE AGREED TO WORK FOR TRUMP FOR

07:29.333 --> 07:30.133
FREE.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.266
AND, LOOK, WHO KNOWS WHY HE DID

07:31.333 --> 07:32.533
THAT?

07:32.600 --> 07:33.700
I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY DO.

07:33.767 --> 07:36.367
AND I PROBABLY DO.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.033
AND ANYONE BRIEFED ON THE BROAD

07:38.100 --> 07:39.300
STROKES OF THE SITUATION, EVEN

07:39.367 --> 07:39.934
IN THE VAGUEST POSSIBLE TERMS,

07:40.000 --> 07:40.767
PROBABLY DOES.

07:40.834 --> 07:43.166
BUT NO ONE BESIDES BASICALLY

07:43.233 --> 07:48.767
ANYONE CAN SAY FOR SURE.

07:48.834 --> 07:49.033
HONESTLY.

07:49.100 --> 07:49.934
HONESTLY.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.500
HONESTLY -- HONESTLY, I CAN

07:54.567 --> 07:56.033
THINK OF ONLY ONE CREATURE ON

07:56.100 --> 08:00.066
EARTH THAT MIGHT WORK ON, AND

08:00.133 --> 08:01.500
UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAS BEEN

08:01.567 --> 08:03.200
SKINNED TO MAKE A SASSY JACKET

08:03.266 --> 08:05.133
FOR PAUL FUCKING MANAFORT.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.166
AND NOW THIS.

08:06.233 --> 08:07.300
>> Announcer: AND NOW, EVEN MORE

08:07.367 --> 08:08.367
OF PAUL MANAFORT'S JACKETS AND

08:08.433 --> 08:11.100
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THEIR OWNER.

08:11.166 --> 08:12.100
I BRIEFLY DATED YOUR NANA AFTER

08:12.166 --> 08:14.133
HER THIRD DIVORCE.

08:14.200 --> 08:14.734
I'M THE BEST CHER IMPERSONATOR

08:14.800 --> 08:16.533
IN RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.900
I MISSED OUT ON INHERITING A

08:19.967 --> 08:22.967
CANDY FACTORY BECAUSE I

08:23.033 --> 08:24.033
ATE WEIRD GUM.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.100
I'LL BE SKIPPING THE SECOND DAY

08:25.166 --> 08:26.533
OF THIS SAFARI TO MASTURBATE IN

08:26.600 --> 08:28.300
THE HOTEL.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.200
EXCUSE ME, MISS, BUT HAVE YOU

08:29.266 --> 08:31.834
EVER FUCKED IN A TOYOTA TUNDRA?

08:31.900 --> 08:32.800
I WAS OUTBID BY BRADLEY WHITFORD

08:32.867 --> 08:35.967
IN "GET OUT."

08:36.033 --> 08:37.400
I AM THREE CHILDREN STACKED ON

08:37.467 --> 08:38.066
TOP OF EACH OTHER AND STILL

08:38.133 --> 08:42.433
WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD IN THIS.

08:42.500 --> 08:49.900
MARIA FROM "SOUND OF MUSIC"

08:49.967 --> 08:51.233
MADE THIS OUT OF A THROW RUG

08:51.300 --> 08:52.700
RIGHT BEFORE SHE KILLED HERSELF.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.000
I WAS KILLED BY THE BIG BAD

08:54.066 --> 08:56.533
VOODOO DADDY IN 1997 FOR TRYING

08:56.600 --> 08:58.900
TO FUCK THE SAXOPHONE.

08:58.967 --> 09:00.133
>> John: MOVING ON, OUR MAIN

09:00.200 --> 09:00.900
STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:00.967 --> 09:01.533
CRIMINAL JUSTICE, THE PROCESS BY

09:01.600 --> 09:02.767
WHICH YOU'RE ARRESTED, CHARGED,

09:02.834 --> 09:03.633
AND EVENTUALLY, GO BEFORE A JURY

09:03.700 --> 09:07.133
WHO RENDER THEIR VERDICT.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.500
>> WE FIND THE DEFENDANT,

09:10.567 --> 09:14.667
ROBERT BROOKS, NOT GUILTY.

09:14.734 --> 09:17.600
>> WE FIND RANDALL BAILEY GUILTY

09:17.667 --> 09:17.834
GUILTY.

09:17.900 --> 09:18.667
>> WE FIND THE DEFENDANT NOT

09:18.734 --> 09:20.000
GUILTY.

09:20.066 --> 09:21.600
>> HAVE YOU REACHED A WERDICT?

09:21.667 --> 09:22.667
>> WAAACK!

09:22.734 --> 09:24.700
>> GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?

09:24.767 --> 09:26.133
>> WAACK-WAAACK!

09:26.200 --> 09:27.066
>> John: THAT'S OBJECTIVELY

09:27.133 --> 09:28.133
CHARMING, ALTHOUGH ALL THESE

09:28.200 --> 09:29.500
YEARS LATER, I STILL CAN'T

09:29.567 --> 09:30.233
BELIEVE THOSE PENGUINS

09:30.300 --> 09:31.233
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED

09:31.300 --> 09:33.033
THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.166
NOW, WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT

09:35.233 --> 09:36.967
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, WE TEND

09:37.033 --> 09:39.233
TO JUST TALK ABOUT POLICING,

09:39.300 --> 09:41.000
PUBLIC DEFENDERS, JUDGES, AND

09:41.066 --> 09:44.700
PRISONS, AND SKIP OVER A CRUCIAL

09:44.767 --> 09:45.400
ELEMENT: PROSECUTORS --

09:45.467 --> 09:47.533
THE ATTORNEYS WHO

09:47.600 --> 09:48.867
WORK FOR THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND

09:48.934 --> 09:49.600
LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND BRING

09:49.667 --> 09:51.467
CASES TO TRIAL.

09:51.533 --> 09:52.767
THERE ARE ROUGHLY 2,500 D.A.s

09:52.834 --> 09:53.633
OFFICES ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY,

09:53.700 --> 09:54.166
AND THEY HAVE A SURPRISING

09:54.233 --> 09:57.467
AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE AT ALMOST

09:57.533 --> 09:59.100
EVERY SINGLE STAGE OF THE

09:59.166 --> 09:59.734
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BECAUSE

09:59.800 --> 10:00.433
PROSECUTORS DECIDE WHETHER YOU

10:00.500 --> 10:01.800
GET CHARGED AND WHAT YOU GET

10:01.867 --> 10:02.433
CHARGED WITH AND THEREFORE

10:02.500 --> 10:03.400
HEAVILY INFLUENCE WHAT KIND OF

10:03.467 --> 10:05.834
SENTENCE YOU COULD FACE.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.000
AND YOU SORT OF KNOW DEEP DOWN

10:07.066 --> 10:08.800
HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE, BECAUSE

10:08.867 --> 10:11.600
OF A LITTLE PHRASE THAT CROPS UP

10:11.667 --> 10:12.767
CONSTANTLY IN LOCAL NEWS CRIME

10:12.834 --> 10:15.834
STORIES.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.600
>> ULTIMATELY, IT WILL BE

10:18.667 --> 10:19.800
PROSECUTORS WHO DECIDE WHETHER

10:19.867 --> 10:20.800
CHARGES WILL BE FILED.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.467
>> PROSECUTORS WILL DECIDE

10:22.533 --> 10:23.133
WHETHER TO FILE CRIMINAL

10:23.200 --> 10:24.934
CHARGES.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.166
SCHUYLKILL PROSECUTORS WILL

10:26.233 --> 10:26.433
DECIDE

10:26.500 --> 10:28.800
>> PROSECUTORS WILL DECIDE.

10:28.867 --> 10:29.967
>> PROSECUTORS WILL DECIDE.

10:30.033 --> 10:35.567
>> PROSECUTORS WILL DECIDE.

10:35.633 --> 10:36.567
>> John: EXACTLY.

10:36.633 --> 10:37.734
PROSECUTORS WILL DECIDE.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.100
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THREE-WORD

10:39.166 --> 10:39.700
PHRASES YOU HEAR SO OFTEN, YOU

10:39.767 --> 10:40.533
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IT

10:40.600 --> 10:41.200
MEANS ANYMORE, LIKE

10:41.266 --> 10:41.967
"USER AGREEMENT UPDATE" OR

10:42.033 --> 10:42.767
"SOME RESTRICTIONS APPLY" OR

10:42.834 --> 10:43.533
"TYLER PERRY PRESENTS."

10:43.600 --> 10:44.667
YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT, I'M

10:44.734 --> 10:45.333
JUST GOING TO ASSUME THAT HE

10:45.400 --> 10:51.667
PRESENTS EVERYTHING.

10:51.734 --> 10:55.500
IT'S SAFER THAT WAY.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.700
I TECHNICALLY THINK HE PRESENTS

10:56.767 --> 10:57.266
THIS SHOW.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.033
I WOULDN'T BE COMPLETELY

10:58.100 --> 10:58.567
SURPRISED ABOUT THAT.

10:58.633 --> 10:59.300
AND WE TEND NOT TO THINK ABOUT

10:59.367 --> 11:00.066
THAT POWER VERY MUCH, EXCEPT

11:00.133 --> 11:01.433
WHEN THERE'S A HIGH-PROFILE

11:01.500 --> 11:02.266
CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THEIR

11:02.333 --> 11:03.200
FAILURE TO EXERCISE IT, AS HAS

11:03.266 --> 11:03.767
HAPPENED IN NUMEROUS POLICE

11:03.834 --> 11:04.834
SHOOTINGS OF UNARMED BLACK MEN,

11:04.900 --> 11:05.867
OR WHEN MANHATTAN D.A.

11:05.934 --> 11:06.467
CY VANCE DECLINED TO PROSECUTE

11:06.533 --> 11:09.066
HARVEY WEINSTEIN IN 2015 CITING

11:09.133 --> 11:10.767
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE, DESPITE

11:10.834 --> 11:17.600
POLICE OFFICIALS INSISTING THEY

11:17.667 --> 11:18.200
HAD PLENTY OF EVIDENCE,

11:18.266 --> 11:19.133
INCLUDING EXHIBIT A,

11:19.200 --> 11:20.033
HIS FACE.

11:20.100 --> 11:20.967
BUT IT'S WORTH TALKING ABOUT

11:21.033 --> 11:21.834
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PROSECUTORS DO

11:21.900 --> 11:22.867
DECIDE TO EXERCISE THAT POWER,

11:22.934 --> 11:23.567
BECAUSE WHILE MANY TRY TO DO

11:23.633 --> 11:24.800
THEIR JOBS HONORABLY, THAT POWER

11:24.867 --> 11:25.867
CAN BE MISUSED OR AMPLIFY THE

11:25.934 --> 11:26.734
INEQUITIES INHERENT IN THE

11:26.800 --> 11:28.633
SYSTEM.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.533
AND LET'S START WITH A TRULY

11:32.600 --> 11:34.133
INCREDIBLE FACT HERE.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.233
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.800
YOUR FATE IS NOT DECIDED BY A

11:37.867 --> 11:39.233
JUDGE OR A JURY OF YOUR PEERS,

11:39.300 --> 11:42.066
BECAUSE NEARLY 95% OF THE CASES

11:42.133 --> 11:43.000
PROSECUTORS DECIDE TO BRING END

11:43.066 --> 11:44.000
UP WITH THE DEFENDANT PLEADING

11:44.066 --> 11:45.266
GUILTY.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.667
WHAT THAT MEANS IS, NO TRIAL, NO

11:46.734 --> 11:47.600
"INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY,"

11:47.667 --> 11:48.900
JUST A PROSECUTOR STRIKING A

11:48.967 --> 11:50.900
DEAL BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

11:50.967 --> 11:55.033
AND MANY JUDGES ARE RESIGNED TO

11:55.100 --> 11:55.967
THAT FACT, BECAUSE AT LEAST PLEA

11:56.033 --> 11:56.900
BARGAINS KEEP THE SYSTEM MOVING.

11:56.967 --> 12:00.533
>> THE SYSTEM WOULD COLLAPSE IF

12:00.600 --> 12:01.767
EVERY CASE THAT WAS FILED IN THE

12:01.834 --> 12:02.467
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WERE TO

12:02.533 --> 12:04.367
BE SET FOR TRIAL.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.266
THE SYSTEM WOULD JUST ENTIRELY

12:05.333 --> 12:06.700
COLLAPSE.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.900
>> John: EXACTLY.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.300
IT'S AN INADEQUATE SYSTEM THAT

12:09.367 --> 12:09.900
ONLY FUNCTIONS IF PEOPLE

12:09.967 --> 12:11.133
CONSTANTLY GIVE UP.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.500
IT'S BUILT ON THE EXACT SAME

12:12.567 --> 12:14.467
MODEL AS AT&T'S CUSTOMER SERVICE

12:14.533 --> 12:16.233
HOTLINE.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.734
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:17.800 --> 12:18.900
AT&T, NEW OWNERS OF HBO,

12:18.967 --> 12:20.300
LONGTIME OWNERS OF AN

12:20.367 --> 12:21.467
UNFORGIVABLY DOGSHIT

12:21.533 --> 12:24.967
CUSTOMER-SERVICE HOTLINE.

12:25.033 --> 12:27.900
AND, LOOK, IF YOU'RE THINKING,

12:27.967 --> 12:30.000
"WELL, LOOK, IF SOMEBODY PLEADS

12:30.066 --> 12:31.967
GUILTY, THEY MUST'VE DONE IT."

12:32.033 --> 12:33.667
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE

12:33.734 --> 12:34.900
CASE.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.000
IN HOUSTON, TESTING OF SAMPLES

12:36.066 --> 12:38.767
IN DRUG CASES HAVE EXONERATED

12:38.834 --> 12:40.100
133 PEOPLE SINCE 2014, AND THOSE

12:40.166 --> 12:42.000
PEOPLE HAD PLED GUILTY IN EVERY

12:42.066 --> 12:44.700
SINGLE CASE, WHICH IS MESSED UP.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.467
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE

12:47.533 --> 12:49.066
CLAIMING TO HAVE USED DRUGS WHEN

12:49.133 --> 12:50.100
THEY HAVEN'T ARE AWKWARD

12:50.166 --> 12:51.066
TEENAGERS AT HIGH SCHOOL

12:51.133 --> 12:52.400
PARTIES.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.100
"OH, I'M TOTALLY A WEEDER.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.000
I -- I'M INTO ALL THE WEEDS.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.266
I'M STONING RIGHT NOW, THAT'S

12:56.333 --> 12:58.700
HOW POTTED I AM."

12:58.767 --> 13:00.100
SO WHY DO INNOCENT PEOPLE PLEAD

13:00.166 --> 13:02.000
GUILTY?

13:02.066 --> 13:04.000
WELL, PROSECUTORS WILL SOMETIMES

13:04.066 --> 13:05.734
OFFER A DEAL WHILE THREATENING

13:05.800 --> 13:08.200
THAT, IF YOU GO TO TRIAL, THEY

13:08.266 --> 13:08.800
WILL STACK CHARGES AGAINST YOU

13:08.867 --> 13:09.667
AND PURSUE A MUCH HARSHER

13:09.734 --> 13:10.567
SENTENCE.

13:10.633 --> 13:11.667
IT'S SOMETHING COMMONLY REFERRED

13:11.734 --> 13:13.133
TO AS A TRIAL PENALTY.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.433
JUST LISTEN TO RODNEY ROBERTS.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.867
HE WAS ACCUSED OF A

13:18.934 --> 13:20.734
SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT DNA EVIDENCE

13:20.800 --> 13:21.533
LATER PROVED HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.900
AND I'LL LET HIM EXPLAIN WHY HE

13:22.967 --> 13:23.567
TOOK A DEAL.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.433
>> WHEN I FINALLY GOT TO THE

13:25.500 --> 13:27.000
COURT, THIS ATTORNEY, HE CAME IN

13:27.066 --> 13:28.300
AND TOLD ME THAT THE

13:28.367 --> 13:29.266
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE HAD A PLEA

13:29.333 --> 13:30.300
AGREEMENT FOR ME.

13:30.367 --> 13:31.166
I'M LIKE, "PLEA AGREEMENT?

13:31.233 --> 13:33.000
I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT.

13:33.066 --> 13:34.066
YOU KNOW, I TOOK -- I PLED NOT

13:34.133 --> 13:35.133
GUILTY.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.433
I'M INNOCENT.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.367
HE WAS LIKE, THIS URGENT, IT WAS

13:39.433 --> 13:41.133
THIS PRESSURE, AND HE WAS LIKE,

13:41.200 --> 13:43.700
"IF YOU DON'T TAKE THIS DEAL,

13:43.767 --> 13:44.867
THEY ONLY OFFER YOU TWO YEARS,

13:44.934 --> 13:45.800
YOU'LL BE HOME IN TWO YEARS, AND

13:45.867 --> 13:47.233
IF NOT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GONNA

13:47.300 --> 13:48.633
TAKE IT OFF TO TRIAL, THE JUDGE

13:48.700 --> 13:49.667
IS READY TO GIVE YOU LIFE

13:49.734 --> 13:50.800
SENTENCE IF YOU GET FOUND

13:50.867 --> 13:51.567
GUILTY, AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA

13:51.633 --> 13:52.834
GET FOUND GUILTY."

13:52.900 --> 13:53.667
AND THIS IS MY ATTORNEY TELLING

13:53.734 --> 13:54.400
ME.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.400
THIS IS THE ONE PERSON I HAD

13:55.467 --> 13:57.333
THERE TO HELP ME.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.000
SO I THOUGHT THAT, TO GET HOME

13:59.066 --> 14:02.667
TO MY SON, TO MY FAMILY, AND TO

14:02.734 --> 14:05.400
SALVAGE MY LIFE, THAT THE BEST

14:05.467 --> 14:07.400
THING I COULD DO FOR MYSELF IS

14:07.467 --> 14:08.467
TO PLEAD GUILTY AND FIGHT IT

14:08.533 --> 14:13.967
ONCE I GOT HOME.

14:14.033 --> 14:15.633
>> John: AND AS CRAZY AS IT

14:15.700 --> 14:16.200
SOUNDS, THAT KIND OF MAKES

14:16.266 --> 14:16.667
SENSE.

14:16.734 --> 14:17.600
TWO YEARS IN PRISON IS TERRIBLE,

14:17.667 --> 14:21.233
BUT A LIFE SENTENCE IS

14:21.300 --> 14:22.033
ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.

14:22.100 --> 14:22.967
THE ONLY WAY IT'D MAKE SENSE FOR

14:23.033 --> 14:24.133
A DEFENDANT TO RISK THAT IS IF

14:24.200 --> 14:25.066
THEY'RE A GERBIL, BECAUSE TWO

14:25.133 --> 14:28.000
YEARS AND LIFE ARE BASICALLY THE

14:28.066 --> 14:28.734
SAME THING TO THOSE LITTLE

14:28.800 --> 14:29.367
SHITS.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.834
BUT LET'S SAY YOU'RE ONE OF THE

14:30.900 --> 14:32.033
5% OF PEOPLE WHO RISK GOING TO

14:32.100 --> 14:32.233
TRIAL.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.000
PROSECUTORS STILL HAVE LOTS OF

14:33.066 --> 14:35.133
WAYS TO TRY AND GAIN ADVANTAGE.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.467
FOR INSTANCE, PROSECUTORS ARE

14:36.533 --> 14:38.767
NOT ALLOWED TO DISCRIMINATE BY

14:38.834 --> 14:39.767
RACE DURING JURY SELECTION, AND

14:39.834 --> 14:41.433
IF IT'S SUSPECTED THAT THEY ARE,

14:41.500 --> 14:42.667
THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID THAT

14:42.734 --> 14:43.533
THEY COULD BE REQUIRED TO

14:43.600 --> 14:44.633
PROVIDE RACE-NEUTRAL

14:44.700 --> 14:46.667
EXPLANATIONS FOR STRIKING

14:46.734 --> 14:48.333
JURORS, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD

14:48.400 --> 14:50.700
RULE, BUT IT'S BEEN LAUGHABLY

14:50.767 --> 14:52.166
EASY FOR THEM TO GET AROUND,

14:52.233 --> 14:53.033
BECAUSE JUDGES WILL ACCEPT JUST

14:53.100 --> 14:55.500
ABOUT ANY REASON.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.100
IN TEXAS, A TRAINING DOCUMENT

14:57.166 --> 14:58.233
FOR PROSECUTORS EVEN

14:58.300 --> 15:00.533
CONVENIENTLY LISTED EXAMPLES OF

15:00.600 --> 15:02.600
RACE-NEUTRAL REASONS THAT JUDGES

15:02.667 --> 15:04.600
HAD ACCEPTED, INCLUDING HAVING A

15:04.667 --> 15:07.066
1970s HAIRDO, BEING A VERY

15:07.133 --> 15:11.900
PRETTY GIRL WHO MIGHT BE

15:11.967 --> 15:12.800
ATTRACTIVE TO THE DEFENDANT OR

15:12.867 --> 15:14.166
THE DEFENSE COUNSEL, WEARING A

15:14.233 --> 15:15.233
MALCOLM X HAT, AGREEING WITH THE

15:15.300 --> 15:16.934
OJ SIMPSON VERDICT, BEING A MALE

15:17.000 --> 15:17.834
WEARING EARRINGS IN BOTH EARS,

15:17.900 --> 15:19.400
AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, FOR

15:19.467 --> 15:20.500
WEARING A "BAD BOYS CLUB"

15:20.567 --> 15:21.600
JACKET, PINK HAT, AND SNAKESKIN

15:21.667 --> 15:22.867
BELT.

15:22.934 --> 15:25.166
WHICH IS INSULTING, BECAUSE THAT

15:25.233 --> 15:25.734
LOOK DOES NOT MAKE YOU

15:25.800 --> 15:26.800
UNTRUSTWORTHY.

15:26.867 --> 15:37.900
IT MAKES YOU AWESOME.

15:37.967 --> 15:41.066
I LIKE THE WAY I LOOK.

15:41.133 --> 15:42.600
I GUARANTEE IT.

15:42.667 --> 15:43.133
BUT PERHAPS THE AREA WHERE

15:43.200 --> 15:43.734
PROSECUTORS CAN EXERT THE MOST

15:43.800 --> 15:44.367
INFLUENCE CONCERNS EVIDENCE,

15:44.433 --> 15:44.967
BECAUSE THEY CONTROL THE CASE

15:45.033 --> 15:46.600
FILES, THINGS LIKE POLICE

15:46.667 --> 15:47.900
REPORTS, WITNESS INFORMATION,

15:47.967 --> 15:48.567
AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

15:48.633 --> 15:49.300
AND WHILE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

15:49.367 --> 15:50.633
HAND OVER ANY EVIDENCE THAT'S

15:50.700 --> 15:51.233
EXCULPATORY OR THAT MIGHT BE

15:51.300 --> 15:52.233
USEFUL IN YOUR DEFENSE, IN SOME

15:52.300 --> 15:53.100
STATES, INCLUDING NEW YORK, THEY

15:53.166 --> 15:54.367
CAN DO THAT AT THE VERY LAST

15:54.433 --> 15:56.734
MINUTE.

15:56.800 --> 15:57.967
>> SOMETHING INCREDIBLE HAPPENS

15:58.033 --> 15:59.467
ON THE DAY OF TRIAL.

15:59.533 --> 16:03.100
SUDDENLY A CASE FILE THAT, FOR A

16:03.166 --> 16:04.967
YEAR, WAS THIS THICK, SUDDENLY

16:05.033 --> 16:07.900
NOW BECOMES THIS THICK.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.500
AND SO IN OUR MOST SERIOUS

16:09.567 --> 16:11.200
CASES, IN THE CASES WHERE WE

16:11.266 --> 16:13.567
HAVE CLIENTS WHO ARE LOOKING AT

16:13.633 --> 16:15.333
INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF POTENTIAL

16:15.400 --> 16:17.500
JAIL TIME, EVEN LIFE IN JAIL,

16:17.567 --> 16:21.266
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GIVEN WHEN

16:21.333 --> 16:23.533
D.A.s ANSWER READY FOR TRIAL.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.667
AND THE REALITY IS THAT IN

16:25.734 --> 16:26.734
MANHATTAN, TOO OFTEN, IT IS

16:26.800 --> 16:30.266
TRIAL BY AMBUSH.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.100
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.467
THEY CAN HAVE TO ARGUE A CASE

16:33.533 --> 16:34.400
WITHOUT HAVING READ ALL THE

16:34.467 --> 16:34.834
IMPORTANT MATERIAL.

16:34.900 --> 16:35.200
IT'S BASICALLY A

16:35.266 --> 16:36.767
MUCH-HIGHER-STAKES VERSION OF A

16:36.834 --> 16:37.734
KID GIVING A PRESENTATION IN

16:37.800 --> 16:38.734
ENGLISH CLASS WITHOUT HAVING

16:38.800 --> 16:39.300
READ THE BOOK.

16:39.367 --> 16:40.467
"IN CONCLUSION, THROUGHOUT

16:40.533 --> 16:41.734
'WUTHERING HEIGHTS,' THE HEIGHTS

16:41.800 --> 16:42.900
ARE WUTHERING.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.033
BUT BY THE END, THE HEIGHTS

16:44.100 --> 16:45.633
WUTHER MUCH MORE THAN THEY

16:45.700 --> 16:49.700
WUTHERED AT THE BEGINNING.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.333
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME."

16:52.400 --> 16:55.166
JUST A QUICK BUT IMPORTANT

16:55.233 --> 16:56.333
MESSAGE FOR ENGLISH TEACHERS:

16:56.400 --> 16:57.700
NO ONE HAS EVER READ A SINGLE

16:57.767 --> 16:58.967
BOOK YOU HAVE EVER ASSIGNED.

16:59.033 --> 16:59.767
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED.

16:59.834 --> 17:00.800
NOT ONCE.

17:00.867 --> 17:01.767
EVER.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.033
AND, LOOK, SOMETIMES DEFENSE

17:03.100 --> 17:03.567
ATTORNEYS MAY NOT BE GIVEN

17:03.633 --> 17:05.200
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE AT ALL.

17:05.266 --> 17:06.600
IN FACT, AMONG EXONERATION

17:06.667 --> 17:08.233
CASES, AROUND A QUARTER OF THEM

17:08.300 --> 17:09.400
INVOLVED PROSECUTORS CONCEALING

17:09.467 --> 17:13.033
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.567
AND THAT IS BECAUSE PROSECUTORS

17:14.633 --> 17:15.667
TYPICALLY GET TO DECIDE WHETHER

17:15.734 --> 17:17.166
SOMETHING IS RELEVANT TO THE

17:17.233 --> 17:18.200
DEFENSE, WHICH SEEMS INHERENTLY

17:18.266 --> 17:19.133
FLAWED.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.667
YOU CAN'T JUST COUNT ON AN

17:20.734 --> 17:21.800
ADVERSARY TO VOLUNTARILY EXPOSE

17:21.867 --> 17:24.600
ALL THEIR WEAKNESSES.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.367
IN "STAR WARS," THE REBELS HAD

17:26.433 --> 17:29.033
TO STEAL THE DEATH STAR PLANS.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.433
THE EMPIRE DIDN'T JUST EMAIL IT

17:30.500 --> 17:32.367
TO THEM WITH THE SUBJECT LINE,

17:32.433 --> 17:34.166
"FWD: GIGANTIC STUPID WEAK SPOT

17:34.233 --> 17:37.033
."

17:37.100 --> 17:40.100
AND WHEN PROSECUTORS DO WITHHOLD

17:40.166 --> 17:40.967
EVIDENCE, THERE IS VERY LITTLE

17:41.033 --> 17:42.533
ACCOUNTABILITY.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.567
TAKE MICHAEL MORTON.

17:43.633 --> 17:45.133
IN 1987, HE WAS WRONGFULLY

17:45.200 --> 17:45.734
CONVICTED OF HIS WIFE'S MURDER

17:45.800 --> 17:46.934
AFTER THE PROSECUTOR IN THAT

17:47.000 --> 17:47.767
CASE WITHHELD CRUCIAL PIECES OF

17:47.834 --> 17:49.266
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.000
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, THAT

17:51.066 --> 17:51.600
PROSECUTOR, KEN ANDERSON, WAS

17:51.667 --> 17:52.467
HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT

17:52.533 --> 17:53.834
MISCONDUCT.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.066
THE BAD NEWS IS, THERE WAS A

17:55.133 --> 17:56.467
SLIGHT DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE

17:56.533 --> 17:59.100
TWO MEN'S SENTENCES.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.800
>> MORTON SERVED NEARLY 25 YEARS

18:01.867 --> 18:05.867
IN PRISON -- 8,995 DAYS.

18:05.934 --> 18:06.867
AND NOW THE SENTENCE FOR THE

18:06.934 --> 18:08.367
PROSECUTOR -- JUST TEN DAYS IN

18:08.433 --> 18:12.166
JAIL FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT.

18:12.233 --> 18:13.567
>> John: TEN DAYS.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.600
AND HE SERVED LESS THAN HALF

18:14.667 --> 18:15.166
THAT.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.100
ALTHOUGH BEFORE YOU GET TOO MAD,

18:17.166 --> 18:18.266
HE DID ALSO HAVE TO PAY A $500

18:18.333 --> 18:20.934
FINE, WHICH ISN'T THE PENALTY

18:21.000 --> 18:22.400
YOU'D EXPECT FOR WIPING OUT

18:22.467 --> 18:24.533
25 YEARS OF SOMEONE'S LIFE.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.000
IT'S CLOSER TO WHAT YOU'D EXPECT

18:26.066 --> 18:27.033
FOR FUCKING A CANTALOUPE AT

18:27.100 --> 18:28.900
WHOLE FOODS.

18:28.967 --> 18:30.734
"IT'S TEN DAYS FOR THE PUBLIC

18:30.800 --> 18:31.900
INDECENCY, $500 FOR THE

18:31.967 --> 18:35.767
CANTALOUPE."

18:35.834 --> 18:36.900
AND TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE,

18:36.967 --> 18:39.100
ANDERSON IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY

18:39.166 --> 18:40.100
PROSECUTOR TO EVER SERVE ANY

18:40.166 --> 18:44.333
TIME FOR MISCONDUCT RESULTING IN

18:44.400 --> 18:45.533
A WRONGFUL CONVICTION EVER.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.200
THE TRUTH IS, PROSECUTORS RARELY

18:46.266 --> 18:47.266
FACE ANY SORT OF CONSEQUENCES

18:47.333 --> 18:48.400
FOR MISCONDUCT.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.600
STATE BARS ARE SUPPOSED TO HOLD

18:49.667 --> 18:51.100
THEM ACCOUNTABLE, BUT A STUDY OF

18:51.166 --> 18:52.333
FIVE STATES FOUND THAT, IN 660

18:52.400 --> 18:53.967
CASES WHERE COURTS HAD CONFIRMED

18:54.033 --> 18:55.967
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, THE

18:56.033 --> 18:57.266
NUMBER OF PROSECUTORS

18:57.333 --> 18:59.033
DISCIPLINED IN THOSE CASES WAS

18:59.100 --> 19:00.367
ONE.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.734
AND THAT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY

19:02.800 --> 19:04.233
CAN FUEL A DANGEROUS CULTURE

19:04.300 --> 19:05.734
WHERE WINS ARE ALREADY

19:05.800 --> 19:06.433
PRIORITIZED TO A DISTURBING

19:06.500 --> 19:07.967
DEGREE.

19:08.033 --> 19:09.567
IN FACT, IN ONE D.A.'S OFFICE IN

19:09.633 --> 19:10.367
COLORADO, PROSECUTORS WERE PAID

19:10.433 --> 19:11.767
BONUSES FOR ACHIEVING A HIGH

19:11.834 --> 19:14.266
CONVICTION RATE.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.967
AND IN TEXAS, A D.A. REWARDED

19:16.033 --> 19:17.500
CONVICTIONS IN MISDEMEANOR CASES

19:17.567 --> 19:19.367
WITH A PRIZE THEY CALLED THE

19:19.433 --> 19:21.700
"TRIAL DAWG AWARD."

19:21.767 --> 19:24.967
AND LET ME JUST SAY, AS THE

19:25.033 --> 19:26.967
PROUD, PROUD OWNER OF NINE

19:27.033 --> 19:28.200
TRIAL DOGS, MY AWARD GOES TO

19:28.266 --> 19:29.633
THIS ONE.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.600
PLEASE DON'T DIE.

19:32.667 --> 19:33.600
PLEASE.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.433
PLEASE DON'T DIE.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.233
I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW

19:37.300 --> 19:38.467
IMPORTANT IT IS FOR YOU TO HANG

19:38.533 --> 19:44.066
IN THERE.

19:44.133 --> 19:46.233
AND THERE WAS THE NOTORIOUSLY

19:46.300 --> 19:47.400
AGGRESSIVE OFFICE OF

19:47.467 --> 19:48.333
NEW ORLEANS D.A.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.166
HARRY CONNICK SR. WHO IS, YES,

19:50.233 --> 19:50.667
HARRY CONNICK JR.'S DAD.

19:50.734 --> 19:52.000
IN FACT, HERE THEY ARE ON

19:52.066 --> 19:52.867
HARRY JR.'S SHORT-LIVED TALK

19:52.934 --> 19:54.300
SHOW SINGING A WEIRDLY

19:54.367 --> 19:57.100
INAPPROPRIATE DUET.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.200
>> ♪ I'M JUST WILD ABOUT HARRY,

19:59.266 --> 20:05.100
HARRY'S WILD ABOUT ME ♪

20:05.166 --> 20:07.300
♪ THE HEAVENLY BLISSES

20:07.367 --> 20:10.467
OF HIS KISSES ♪

20:10.533 --> 20:16.967
♪ FILL THEM WITH ECSTASY ♪

20:17.033 --> 20:19.066
>> John: I -- UH --

20:20.700 --> 20:22.367
NOW, IF YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY

20:22.433 --> 20:23.367
PROBLEM WITH THAT, HERE'S A FUN

20:23.433 --> 20:24.934
EXPERIMENT FOR YOU TO TRY AT

20:25.000 --> 20:25.367
HOME.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.667
CALL YOUR OWN FATHER RIGHT NOW,

20:26.734 --> 20:27.700
TELL HIM THAT "THE HEAVENLY

20:27.767 --> 20:28.633
BLISSES OF HIS KISSES FILL YOU

20:28.700 --> 20:30.100
WITH ECSTASY," AND JUST SEE HOW

20:30.166 --> 20:32.767
THAT GOES.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.000
MY PREDICTION IS, YOUR NEXT

20:34.066 --> 20:35.400
FISHING TRIP IS GOING TO BE

20:35.467 --> 20:36.767
EXTRA QUIET.

20:36.834 --> 20:37.767
BUT DURING HIS TIME AS

20:37.834 --> 20:39.233
NEW ORLEANS D.A., LOTS OF PEOPLE

20:39.300 --> 20:40.800
WERE WILD ABOUT

20:40.867 --> 20:42.033
HARRY CONNICK SR. BECAUSE HIS

20:42.100 --> 20:47.200
OFFICE WAS FAMOUSLY RUTHLESS.

20:47.266 --> 20:49.300
>> HARRY CONNICK WAS TOUGH ON

20:49.367 --> 20:49.500
CRIME.

20:49.567 --> 20:50.533
>> HE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE AND HE

20:50.600 --> 20:51.233
WANTED TO LOCK THEM UP ALL

20:51.300 --> 20:52.000
FOREVER.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.400
>> CONNICK'S LEAD PROSECUTOR WAS

20:53.467 --> 20:54.800
JIM WILLIAMS.

20:54.867 --> 20:55.767
JIM TOOK GREAT PRIDE IN HIS

20:55.834 --> 20:56.600
NUMEROUS DEATH PENALTY

20:56.667 --> 20:59.000
CONVICTIONS.

20:59.066 --> 21:00.300
HE EVEN KEPT A MINIATURE

21:00.367 --> 21:01.400
ELECTRIC CHAIR ON HIS DESK.

21:01.467 --> 21:02.567
>> JIM WAS REGARDED AS ONE OF

21:02.633 --> 21:04.000
THE MOST AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTORS

21:04.066 --> 21:05.433
IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

21:05.500 --> 21:06.867
OFFICE.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.333
HE DESCRIBED SLIDING UP BEHIND

21:08.400 --> 21:10.967
DEFENDANTS IN THE COURTROOM AND

21:11.033 --> 21:12.667
BUZZING IN THEIR EARS TO MIMIC

21:12.734 --> 21:15.200
THE BUZZ OF ELECTRICITY.

21:15.266 --> 21:16.900
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

21:16.967 --> 21:18.700
THAT IS JUST NOT OKAY.

21:18.767 --> 21:20.033
ALTHOUGH THERE IS ALSO NO

21:20.100 --> 21:21.433
SCENARIO IN WHICH SLIDING UP

21:21.500 --> 21:23.000
BEHIND SOMEONE AND SAYING "BUZZ"

21:23.066 --> 21:25.033
IN THEIR EAR IS ACCEPTABLE.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.734
NOT EVEN IF YOU ARE

21:26.800 --> 21:27.567
NEIL ARMSTRONG ON THE MOON AND

21:27.633 --> 21:28.700
YOU NEED TO GET BUZZ ALDRIN'S

21:28.767 --> 21:30.967
ATTENTION.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.000
"HEY, BUZZ.

21:32.066 --> 21:33.033
BUZZ.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.100
BUZZ.

21:34.166 --> 21:35.600
BUZZ.

21:35.667 --> 21:36.867
WE'RE ON THE MOON, BUZZ.

21:36.934 --> 21:37.834
BUZZ.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.867
BUZZ.

21:39.934 --> 21:41.300
BUZZ.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.433
ARE YOU MAD I WAS FIRST?

21:42.500 --> 21:45.533
BUZZ.

21:45.600 --> 21:50.834
BUZZ."

21:50.900 --> 21:52.800
BUT THAT OFFICE'S

21:52.867 --> 21:54.367
WIN-AT-ALL-COSTS CULTURE

21:54.433 --> 21:55.266
RESULTED IN SERIOUS MISTAKES.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.100
AS IT TURNS OUT, FULLY

21:56.166 --> 21:57.000
A QUARTER OF THE MEN SENTENCED

21:57.066 --> 21:57.800
TO DEATH DURING CONNICK'S TENURE

21:57.867 --> 21:58.633
HAD THEIR CONVICTIONS OVERTURNED

21:58.700 --> 21:59.767
BECAUSE OF IMPROPERLY WITHHELD

21:59.834 --> 22:01.066
EVIDENCE.

22:01.133 --> 22:02.266
AND REMEMBER THAT LITTLE

22:02.333 --> 22:03.133
ELECTRIC CHAIR ONE OF THE

22:03.200 --> 22:04.433
PROSECUTORS HAD ON HIS DESK?

22:04.500 --> 22:07.033
HERE'S A FUN FACT.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.333
>> IN THE PHOTO OF JIM WILLIAMS

22:08.400 --> 22:09.834
WITH THE ELECTRIC CHAIR, OF THE

22:09.900 --> 22:11.300
FIVE FACES VISIBLE, ALL OF THEM

22:11.367 --> 22:14.333
WERE RELEASED FROM DEATH ROW.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.834
>> John: YUP.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.800
THE THING HE KEPT AS A TOKEN OF

22:18.867 --> 22:19.600
HIS SUCCESS IS NOW A MONUMENT TO

22:19.667 --> 22:23.734
POOR DECISION-MAKING.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.166
IT IS THE PROSECUTORIAL

22:25.233 --> 22:25.800
EQUIVALENT OF CUBA GOODING JR.'S

22:25.867 --> 22:26.700
OSCAR.

22:26.767 --> 22:29.200
AND, LOOK --

22:29.266 --> 22:31.400
WHY DID THAT JOKE UPSET YOU MORE

22:31.467 --> 22:36.100
THAN ANYTHING ELSE TONIGHT?

22:36.166 --> 22:40.867
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE CONSISTENT!

22:40.934 --> 22:43.600
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE!

22:43.667 --> 22:49.233
YOU MIGHT CARE ABOUT CUBA.

22:49.300 --> 22:50.100
YOU CARE TOO MUCH IN THIS

22:50.166 --> 22:53.600
CONTEXT.

22:53.667 --> 22:55.066
IF YOU WANT TO SEE ALL THE

22:55.133 --> 22:55.900
PROBLEMS I'VE JUST DESCRIBED IN

22:55.967 --> 22:56.533
ACTION, TAKE A LOOK AT THE CASE

22:56.600 --> 22:57.166
OF GLENN FORD, WHO WAS ON DEATH

22:57.233 --> 22:57.767
ROW FOR 30 YEARS AFTER BEING

22:57.834 --> 22:58.233
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED.

22:58.300 --> 22:58.834
THE PROSECUTOR ON HIS CASE,

22:58.900 --> 23:00.567
MARTY STROUD, SAYS THAT HE GOT

23:00.633 --> 23:01.133
CAUGHT UP IN AN AGGRESSIVE,

23:01.200 --> 23:05.700
HARD-CHARGING CULTURE, AND

23:05.767 --> 23:06.734
ADMITS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

23:06.800 --> 23:07.400
DELIBERATELY EXCLUDING

23:07.467 --> 23:08.533
AFRICAN-AMERICAN JURORS AND

23:08.600 --> 23:09.166
OVERLOOKING EVIDENCE THAT WOULD

23:09.233 --> 23:09.667
HAVE CLEARED GLENN FORD.

23:09.734 --> 23:10.533
AND WHAT HAPPENED CLEARLY HAUNTS

23:10.600 --> 23:11.900
HIM.

23:11.967 --> 23:13.233
>> I ENDED UP, WITHOUT ANYBODY

23:13.300 --> 23:14.367
ELSE'S HELP, PUTTING A MAN ON

23:14.433 --> 23:15.266
DEATH ROW WHO DIDN'T BELONG

23:15.333 --> 23:18.533
THERE.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.200
I MEAN, AT THE END OF THE DAY --

23:20.266 --> 23:21.800
THE BEGINNING, END, MIDDLE,

23:21.867 --> 23:25.266
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT --

23:25.333 --> 23:26.166
I DID SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY,

23:26.233 --> 23:28.266
VERY BAD.

23:28.333 --> 23:33.000
>> John: YEAH, IT WAS.

23:33.066 --> 23:35.900
IT WAS VERY, VERY, VERY,

23:35.967 --> 23:36.834
BAD, IN FACT.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.100
THE PROBLEM IS, WHILE HE'S

23:38.166 --> 23:38.734
CLEARLY REMORSEFUL, IN TERMS OF

23:38.800 --> 23:39.333
ACCOUNTABILITY, THERE WERE NO

23:39.400 --> 23:39.967
PROFESSIONAL SANCTIONS FOR HIS

23:40.033 --> 23:41.033
ACTIONS.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.266
IN FACT, THE ACTING D.A. AFTER

23:43.333 --> 23:43.967
FORD WAS RELEASED, DALE COX,

23:44.033 --> 23:44.934
DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT STROUD

23:45.000 --> 23:46.200
SHOULD HAVE APOLOGIZED.

23:46.266 --> 23:47.367
>> DID MR. FORD GET JUSTICE IN

23:47.433 --> 23:48.400
THIS CASE?

23:48.467 --> 23:50.200
>> I THINK HE HAS GOTTEN DELAYED

23:50.266 --> 23:51.467
JUSTICE.

23:51.533 --> 23:52.600
THE SYSTEM DID NOT FAIL

23:52.667 --> 23:53.767
MR. FORD.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.433
>> IT DID NOT?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.734
>> IT DID NOT.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.734
IN FACT --

23:57.800 --> 23:59.967
>> HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

24:00.033 --> 24:01.433
>> BECAUSE HE'S NOT ON

24:01.500 --> 24:02.433
DEATH ROW.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.867
AND THAT'S HOW I CAN SAY IT.

24:03.934 --> 24:05.533
>> GETTING OUT OF PRISON AFTER

24:05.600 --> 24:07.567
30 YEARS IS JUSTICE?

24:07.633 --> 24:08.900
>> WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN DYING

24:08.967 --> 24:10.233
THERE AND IT'S BETTER THAN BEING

24:10.300 --> 24:18.100
EXECUTED.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.233
>> John: YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S

24:19.300 --> 24:20.667
TRUE, BUT LISTEN TO HOW LOW HE'S

24:20.734 --> 24:21.266
SETTING THE BAR: BETTER THAN

24:21.333 --> 24:21.800
BEING EXECUTED OR DYING IN

24:21.867 --> 24:22.033
PRISON.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.033
BY THAT MEASURE, ANYTHING

24:23.100 --> 24:23.834
SUCCEEDS.

24:23.900 --> 24:25.200
"TACO BELL: BETTER THAN BEING

24:25.266 --> 24:30.500
EXECUTED OR DYING IN PRISON."

24:30.567 --> 24:33.834
IS IT?

24:33.900 --> 24:34.800
IS IT DEFINITELY?

24:34.867 --> 24:35.367
BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014, THAT

24:35.433 --> 24:36.000
MAN'S OFFICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

24:36.066 --> 24:36.633
SENDING MORE PRISONERS TO DEATH

24:36.700 --> 24:37.767
ROW THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE

24:37.834 --> 24:38.033
COUNTRY.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.333
AND IF YOU THINK THE GLENN FORD

24:40.400 --> 24:41.834
CASE MAY HAVE MADE HIM MORE

24:41.900 --> 24:42.934
CAUTIOUS, YOU WOULD BE WRONG.

24:43.000 --> 24:43.867
>> I THINK SOCIETY SHOULD BE

24:43.934 --> 24:45.200
EMPLOYING THE DEATH PENALTY MORE

24:45.266 --> 24:46.133
RATHER THAN LESS.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.266
>> BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TEN OTHER

24:48.333 --> 24:49.700
INMATES ON DEATH ROW IN

24:49.767 --> 24:51.500
LOUISIANA WHO HAVE BEEN

24:51.567 --> 24:53.767
EXONERATED.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.233
CLEARLY, THE SYSTEM IS NOT

24:55.300 --> 24:58.667
FLAWLESS.

24:58.734 --> 25:00.000
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN

25:00.066 --> 25:01.867
IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME?

25:01.934 --> 25:03.133
>> I'M REASONABLY CONFIDENT

25:03.200 --> 25:04.500
THAT -- THAT I'VE GOTTEN IT

25:04.567 --> 25:05.700
RIGHT.

25:05.767 --> 25:06.967
>> John: OH, YOU'RE REASONABLY

25:07.033 --> 25:08.033
CONFIDENT, ARE YOU?

25:08.100 --> 25:09.600
THAT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT

25:09.667 --> 25:10.533
SHOULD BE THE STANDARD TO SEND

25:10.600 --> 25:11.633
SOMEONE TO DEATH ROW.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.800
I WAS REASONABLY CONFIDENT I

25:12.867 --> 25:14.567
COULD PULL OFF BANGS.

25:14.633 --> 25:16.600
I WAS FUCKING WRONG ABOUT THAT,

25:16.667 --> 25:17.834
AND IF SOMEONE'S LIFE HAD

25:17.900 --> 25:18.934
DEPENDED ON IT, I MIGHT'VE GIVEN

25:19.000 --> 25:20.633
IT A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT.

25:20.700 --> 25:23.600
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MAY BE

25:23.667 --> 25:25.834
WONDERING HOW WE FIX SOME OF

25:25.900 --> 25:26.934
WHAT WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.166
WELL, CLEARLY, PERMANENT

25:28.233 --> 25:30.066
LEGISLATIVE FIXES ARE BADLY

25:30.133 --> 25:31.200
NEEDED, FROM REQUIRING GREATER

25:31.266 --> 25:31.800
TRANSPARENCY FROM PROSECUTORS

25:31.867 --> 25:33.633
ABOUT SHARING EVIDENCE THROUGH

25:33.700 --> 25:34.700
SO-CALLED "OPEN FILE LAWS", TO,

25:34.767 --> 25:35.700
IDEALLY, ESTABLISHING

25:35.767 --> 25:36.734
INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS TO

25:36.800 --> 25:38.734
INVESTIGATE MISCONDUCT.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.567
BUT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE,

25:39.633 --> 25:41.300
THERE MAY BE A MORE DIRECT WAY

25:41.367 --> 25:42.700
FOR YOU TO EFFECT CHANGE,

25:42.767 --> 25:43.333
BECAUSE DA'S ARE USUALLY

25:43.400 --> 25:44.600
ELECTED.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.567
IT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT

25:46.633 --> 25:47.934
SOMETIMES FORGET UNTIL YOU SEE

25:48.000 --> 25:50.367
AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN ATTACK ADS

25:50.433 --> 25:50.967
LIKE THIS ONE, WHICH ENDS IN A

25:51.033 --> 25:54.333
BIZARRE TURN OF PHRASE.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.033
>> THIS IS HOW MANY CHILD

25:56.100 --> 25:57.667
MOLESTERS THE CALCASIEU PARISH

25:57.734 --> 25:59.033
D.A. HAS PROSECUTED AS LEAD

25:59.100 --> 26:01.133
COUNSEL...

26:01.200 --> 26:02.900
HOW MANY MURDERS...

26:02.967 --> 26:04.467
HOW MANY RAPES...

26:04.533 --> 26:07.000
ROBBERIES...

26:07.066 --> 26:08.633
MEANWHILE, OUR SHERIFF REPORTS

26:08.700 --> 26:10.767
CRIME IS ON THE RISE IN

26:10.834 --> 26:14.200
CALCASIEU PARISH.

26:14.266 --> 26:15.567
STEVE STREET FOR DISTRICT

26:15.633 --> 26:18.667
ATTORNEY, CALCASIEU PARISH.

26:18.734 --> 26:19.834
HE'LL TRY HARDER, AND A LOT MORE

26:19.900 --> 26:22.200
OFTEN.

26:22.266 --> 26:25.000
>> John: WHAT?

26:25.066 --> 26:26.667
"HE'LL TRY HARDER, AND A LOT

26:26.734 --> 26:27.767
MORE OFTEN?"

26:27.834 --> 26:28.667
THAT'S A PRETTY WEAK PROMISE,

26:28.734 --> 26:31.233
STEVE.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.767
WHAT THE FUCK WAS YOUR

26:32.834 --> 26:33.500
OPPONENT'S SLOGAN?

26:33.567 --> 26:34.200
"NATHAN HAMILTON: JUSTICE ON

26:34.266 --> 26:35.166
MONDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS UNLESS

26:35.233 --> 26:35.767
SOMETHING COMES UP OR IT SEEMS

26:35.834 --> 26:36.633
LIKE IT'S GONNA BE A WHOLE

26:36.700 --> 26:42.033
'THING'."

26:42.100 --> 26:42.934
THE FACT PROSECUTORS ARE ELECTED

26:43.000 --> 26:45.333
MEANS YOU CAN CHANGE THEM.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.100
THE PROBLEM IS, AROUND

26:46.166 --> 26:46.867
85% OF PROSECUTORS ACTUALLY RUN

26:46.934 --> 26:47.633
UNOPPOSED IN BOTH PRIMARY AND

26:47.700 --> 26:48.367
GENERAL ELECTIONS.

26:48.433 --> 26:49.200
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT IN ONE

26:49.266 --> 26:50.400
COUNTY IN WASHINGTON STATE,

26:50.467 --> 26:51.467
THEIR PROSECUTOR HAD RUN FOR TEN

26:51.533 --> 26:53.200
TERMS WITHOUT ANY OPPOSITION, SO

26:53.266 --> 26:55.333
FOUR YEARS AGO, IN FRUSTRATION,

26:55.400 --> 26:56.600
SOMEONE RAN THEIR DOG AGAINST

26:56.667 --> 26:59.266
HIM.

26:59.333 --> 27:02.300
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:

27:02.367 --> 27:03.200
"OH, GREAT, ANOTHER WHITE DOG

27:03.266 --> 27:03.934
PROSECUTOR."

27:04.000 --> 27:05.300
AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE WRONG,

27:05.367 --> 27:06.100
BUT LET'S GO ONE STEP AT A TIME

27:06.166 --> 27:13.066
HERE.

27:13.133 --> 27:17.734
CLEARLY WE NEED MORE REFORM-

27:17.800 --> 27:18.166
REFORM-MINDED D.A.

27:18.233 --> 27:20.300
D.A.s TO RU.

27:20.367 --> 27:21.367
BECAUSE THANKS TO THE EXTREME

27:21.433 --> 27:21.934
BREADTH OF POWER THEY HAVE,

27:22.000 --> 27:22.800
CHANGES IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE

27:22.867 --> 27:23.700
COULD BE A BACK-DOOR WAY TO GET

27:23.767 --> 27:24.467
REFORM ON A WHOLE HOST OF

27:24.533 --> 27:25.300
ISSUES, FROM BAIL TO THE MISUSE

27:25.367 --> 27:26.166
OF FORENSIC SCIENCE TO THE

27:26.233 --> 27:27.000
ENFORCEMENT OF MARIJUANA LAWS.

27:27.066 --> 27:27.767
AND MAYBE YOU'RE ONE OF THE

27:27.834 --> 27:28.533
LUCKY ONES HERE.

27:28.600 --> 27:29.333
MAYBE YOUR LOCAL D.A. IS GREAT.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.433
OR MAYBE THEY'RE A WIN-OBSESSED

27:30.500 --> 27:31.300
ASSHOLE WHOSE HEAVENLY BLISSES

27:31.367 --> 27:32.133
OF THEIR KISSES FILL THEIR ADULT

27:32.200 --> 27:33.266
SONS WITH ECSTASY.

27:33.333 --> 27:34.066
OR MAYBE YOU LIVE IN WASHINGTON

27:34.133 --> 27:34.934
STATE, AND FOR THE PAST FOUR

27:35.000 --> 27:36.367
YEARS, YOUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY

27:36.433 --> 27:37.200
HAS BEEN THIS FUCKING DOG AND

27:37.266 --> 27:39.133
YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.400
BECAUSE CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY

27:40.467 --> 27:41.967
WITH 100% CERTAINTY THAT YOUR

27:42.033 --> 27:46.033
DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS NOT A DOG?

27:46.100 --> 27:47.033
YOU PROBABLY CAN'T.

27:47.100 --> 27:47.900
AND THAT'S KIND OF THE PROBLEM

27:47.967 --> 27:49.233
HERE.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.266
MOST PEOPLE KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT

27:50.333 --> 27:57.433
THEIR LOCAL D.A. AS THEY DO

27:57.500 --> 27:58.166
ABOUT THEIR LOCAL

27:58.233 --> 27:58.867
CHEESECAKE FACTORY MANAGER.

27:58.934 --> 27:59.834
CHANCES ARE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO

27:59.900 --> 28:00.433
THEY ARE, AND IF YOU DO, IT'S

28:00.500 --> 28:01.300
PROBABLY BECAUSE SOMETHING TRULY

28:01.367 --> 28:02.200
TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

28:02.266 --> 28:03.367
BUT THE TRUTH IS, LIKE THE

28:03.433 --> 28:05.133
CHEESECAKE FACTORY, PROSECUTORS

28:05.200 --> 28:06.667
HAVE THE ABILITY TO RUIN LIVES

28:06.734 --> 28:08.934
IN A SECOND.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.500
SO WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO OUR

28:11.567 --> 28:12.967
D.A.s ARE AND GET A SENSE OF

28:13.033 --> 28:14.433
THE POLICIES AND THE PRIORITIES

28:14.500 --> 28:15.667
THAT THEY'RE CARRYING OUT WHERE

28:15.734 --> 28:17.033
WE LIVE.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.667
BECAUSE IF WE DO NOT DECIDE WHAT

28:19.734 --> 28:21.500
WE WANT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

28:21.567 --> 28:22.500
SYSTEM TO LOOK LIKE, DEEP DOWN,

28:22.567 --> 28:23.233
YOU KNOW WHO WILL.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.300
>> PROSECUTORS WILL DECIDE.

28:25.367 --> 28:27.033
>> John: EXACTLY.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.567
THEY FUCKING WILL.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.266
AND NOW THIS.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.000
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

28:32.066 --> 28:33.667
"FOX & FRIENDS"'S BRIAN KILMEADE

28:33.734 --> 28:35.600
IS DEFINITELY AFRAID OF SHARKS.

28:35.667 --> 28:36.767
>> IT'S SHARK WEEK AND WE HAVE

28:36.834 --> 28:38.266
REAL SHARKS.

28:38.333 --> 28:38.900
NEED PROOF?

28:38.967 --> 28:40.066
THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.467
A GREAT WHITE SHARK COULD BE

28:41.533 --> 28:44.734
COMING TO YOUR BEACH.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.233
WHERE THAT SHARK IS HEADING AND

28:46.300 --> 28:47.367
DOES HE HAVE YOUR NAME ON HIS

28:47.433 --> 28:50.166
MIND?

28:50.233 --> 28:50.934
SURFERS GETTING EATEN BY A

28:51.000 --> 28:51.667
SHARK.

28:51.734 --> 28:54.600
THEY ALMOST GOT EATEN BY SHARKS.

28:54.667 --> 28:55.400
AT SEAWORLD, HOW MANY SHARKS DO

28:55.467 --> 28:56.200
YOU HAVE, HOW DO YOU SEE THEM?

28:56.266 --> 28:57.233
WHY ARE YOU NOT INTIMIDATED BY

28:57.300 --> 28:58.734
SHARKS?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.133
WHY ARE ALL THE BIG CREATURES

29:00.200 --> 29:01.166
COMING SO CLOSE TO SHORE?

29:01.233 --> 29:05.600
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE WE ARE

29:05.667 --> 29:06.133
GETTING JUST WAY TOO MANY

29:06.200 --> 29:06.734
SHARKS?

29:06.800 --> 29:11.533
WHY ARE THE SHARKS SO ANGRY?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.166
>> I WAS DOWN IN PALM BEACH, I

29:13.233 --> 29:13.433
SAW THEM.

29:13.500 --> 29:24.900
>> WE WERE ATTACKED.

29:24.967 --> 29:28.533
>> I WAS TOLD THAT SHARKS DON'T

29:28.600 --> 29:29.200
LIKE THE TASTE OF HUMANS.

29:29.266 --> 29:29.867
>> PUNCH THEM IN THE NOSE.

29:29.934 --> 29:30.900
>> WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PUNCH THEM

29:30.967 --> 29:31.300
IN THE NOSE.

29:31.367 --> 29:32.033
WE SHOULD STAY OUT OF THE OCEAN

29:32.100 --> 29:32.767
AS HUMAN BEINGS UNTIL THE OCEAN

29:32.834 --> 29:33.467
STARTS COMING DOWN.

29:33.533 --> 29:34.300
ONE WORD, "POOL."

29:34.367 --> 29:35.233
GO IN A POOL AND STAY AWAY FROM

29:35.300 --> 29:35.500
THE BEACH.

29:35.567 --> 29:36.667
>> A SPINNER SHARK JUMPED OUT

29:36.734 --> 29:37.000
AND AT ME.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.066
>> THERE IS SUCH A THING SUCH AS

29:38.133 --> 29:38.433
A SPINNER SHARK?

29:38.500 --> 29:39.033
>> JUMPS OUT OF THE WATER AND

29:39.100 --> 29:39.467
GOES INTO A SPIN.

29:39.533 --> 29:40.300
UNFORTUNATELY, IT CAME RIGHT AT

29:40.367 --> 29:40.967
ME.

29:41.033 --> 29:41.767
AND THEN I WENT LICKETY-SPLIT.

29:41.834 --> 29:42.734
THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THE LAST

29:42.800 --> 29:44.734
TIME I HAVE BEEN IN THE WATER.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.667
>> John: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

29:45.734 --> 29:46.300
WATCHING, WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT

29:46.367 --> 29:47.133
WEEK.

29:47.200 --> 29:51.834
GOOD NIGHT!
