00:19.228 --> 00:21.697
- Have you got everything?
- I've got everything. Don't worry.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.194
Be careful.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.571
- You have to call Mo about...
- Never mind Mo.

00:31.114 --> 00:34.368
- Okay, I'm going now. I love you.
- Love you.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.504
- Love you.
- Bye.

01:04.772 --> 01:08.698
- So where are we going?
- Further than we've ever gone before.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.243
It's the year five billion
and twenty-three.

01:57.367 --> 02:02.373
We're in the galaxy M87 and this...
This is New Earth.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.958
It's just...

02:07.794 --> 02:09.637
That's just...

02:10.547 --> 02:13.016
Not bad. Not bad at all.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.889
That's amazing.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.021
I'll never get used to this, never.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.771
Different ground beneath my feet.
Different sky.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.102
What's that smell?

02:24.936 --> 02:28.861
- Apple grass.
- Apple grass. It's beautiful.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.444
Oh, I love this.

02:32.527 --> 02:37.454
Can I just say, travelling with you...
I love it.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.584
Me, too.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.252
Come on.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.422
Human! She's pure-blood human.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.713
Closer, closer.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.893
So, the year five billion,
the sun expands, the Earth gets roasted.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.568
That was our first date.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.317
We had chips.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.903
So anyway, planet gone, all rocks and dust,

03:10.982 --> 03:13.531
but the human race lives on,
spread out across the stars.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.534
As soon as the Earth burns up,
oh, they get all nostalgic.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.117
Big revival movement. They find this place.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.457
Same size as the Earth,
same air, same orbit, lovely.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.414
The call goes out, the humans move in.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.716
- What's the city called?
- New New York.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.589
- Oh, come on.
- It is!

03:29.668 --> 03:32.137
It's the City of New New York.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.512
Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth
New York since the original.

03:35.590 --> 03:36.842
So that makes it

03:36.925 --> 03:40.350
New New New New New New New New New
New New New New New New York.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.395
- What?
- You're so different.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.226
New new Doctor.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.698
Impossible!
I recognise that child.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.867
Her face! Show me her face!

03:53.942 --> 03:55.319
Closer, closer.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.534
Face, face, face!

04:00.073 --> 04:03.748
Can we go and visit New New York?
So good they named it twice.

04:03.827 --> 04:07.832
Well, I thought we might go there first.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.925
- Why? What is it?
- Some sort of hospital.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.005
Green moon on the side,
that's the universal symbol for hospitals.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.966
I got this. A message on the psychic paper.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.343
Someone wants to see me.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.605
Oh, and I thought we were just sightseeing.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.400
Come on, then,
let's go and buy some grapes.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.900
Rose Tyler! I knew it!

04:31.188 --> 04:34.192
- That dirty blonde assassin.
- She's coming here, mistress.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.531
But this is beyond coincidence.
This is destiny.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.155
At last, I can be revenged
on that little...

04:40.238 --> 04:41.831
A bit rich coming from you.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.251
I can't help it. I don't like hospitals.
They give me the creeps.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.745
The pleasure gardens
will now take visitors

04:46.870 --> 04:51.046
carrying green or blue identification cards
for the next 75 minutes.

04:51.124 --> 04:55.721
Visitors are reminded that cuttings
from the gardens are not permitted.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.050
Very smart. Not exactly NHS.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.975
No shop. I like the little shop.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.645
I thought this far in the future,
they'd have cured everything.

05:03.720 --> 05:08.351
The human race moves on,
but so do the viruses. It's an ongoing war.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.315
Hope, harmony and health.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.615
- They're cats.
- Now, don't stare.

05:15.690 --> 05:19.411
Think what you look like to them.
All pink and yellow.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.369
That's where I'd put the shop, right there.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.410
Ward 26, thanks.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.545
Override controls.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.247
Hold on, hold on!

05:30.330 --> 05:33.459
- Oh, too late. I'm going up.
- All right, there's another lift.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.759
Ward 26!

05:34.835 --> 05:37.429
- And watch out for the disinfectant.
- Watch out for what?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.427
- The disinfectant!
- The what?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.762
The dis... Oh, you'll find out.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.272
Ward 26, thanks.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.027
Commence stage one disinfection.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.541
Commence stage one disinfection.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.152
The human child is clean.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.030
Erm, I'm looking for ward 26.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.865
This way, Rose Tyler.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.885
Nice place.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.513
No shop downstairs. I'd have a shop.
Not a big one, just a shop.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.143
So people can shop.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.520
The hospital is a place of healing.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.855
A shop does some people
the world of good. Not me, other people.

07:19.356 --> 07:24.954
The Sisters of Plenitude
take a Lifelong vow to help and to mend.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.289
Excuse me!

07:29.324 --> 07:32.749
Members of the public may only gaze
upon the Duke of Manhattan

07:32.869 --> 07:35.292
with written permission from
the Senate of New New York.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.876
- That's petrifold regression, right?
- I'm dying, sir.

07:38.959 --> 07:43.760
A lifetime of charity and abstinence
and it ends like this.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.715
Any statements made by
the Duke of Manhattan

07:45.840 --> 07:48.059
may not be made public
without official clearance.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.228
Frau Clovis...

07:51.930 --> 07:53.807
I'm so weak.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.435
Sister Jatt, a little privacy, please.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.652
- He'll be up and about in no time.
- I doubt it.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.907
Petrifold regression, he's turning to stone.
There won't be a cure for a thousand years.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.829
He might be up and about
but only as a statue.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.282
Have faith in the Sisterhood.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.284
But is there no one here you recognise?

08:12.367 --> 08:15.997
It's rather unusual to visit
without knowing the patient.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.628
No, I think I've found him.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.971
Novice Hame, if I can leave
this gentleman in your care.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.809
Oh, I think my friend got lost.
Rose Tyler. Could you ask at reception?

08:28.925 --> 08:30.518
Certainly, sir.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.725
I'm afraid the Face of Boe is asleep.
That's all he tends to do these days.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.147
Are you a friend, or...

08:39.227 --> 08:43.152
We met just the once. On Platform One.
What's wrong with him?

08:43.231 --> 08:45.950
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.071
The Face of Boe is dying.

08:49.612 --> 08:54.288
- Of what?
- Old age. One thing we can't cure.

08:54.909 --> 08:59.380
He's thousands of years old,
some people say millions,

08:59.664 --> 09:01.462
although that's impossible.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.382
Oh, I don't know. I like impossible.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.221
I'm here. I look a bit
different, but it's me.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.473
It's the Doctor.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.211
Look at me!

09:42.999 --> 09:44.626
Isn't it wonderful?

09:46.169 --> 09:49.389
Well, you never know what
your life is going to be like, ever.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.640
I'm bored with this drink. Anyway...

09:51.716 --> 09:56.392
Oh, hello, darling. Oh!
Now don '2'. Stop it.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.140
Wait a minute. That's...

09:58.223 --> 09:59.395
Peek-a-boo!

09:59.516 --> 10:01.518
Don't you come
anywhere near me, Cassandra.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.696
Why? What do you think I'm going to do?
Flap you to death?

10:04.771 --> 10:08.901
- Yeah, but what about Gollum?
- Oh, that's just Chip. He's my pet.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.451
I worship the mistress.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.121
Moisturise me, moisturise me.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.952
He's not even a proper life form.
He's a force-grown clone.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.662
I modelled him on my favourite pattern.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.793
But he's so faithful.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.882
Chip sees to my physical needs.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.588
I hope that means food.
How come you're still alive?

10:28.670 --> 10:31.719
- After you murdered me?
- That was your own fault.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.221
The brain of my mistress survived.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.804
And her pretty blue eyes
were salvaged from the bin.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.514
What about the skin?

10:39.597 --> 10:43.147
I saw it. You got ripped apart.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.230
That piece of skin
was taken from the front of my body.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.939
This piece is the back.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.071
- Right, so you're talking out of your...
- Ask not!

10:51.151 --> 10:55.748
The mistress was lucky to survive.
Chip secreted m'lady into the hospital.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.291
- So they don't know you're here?
- Chip steals medicine.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.708
Helps m'lady. Soothes her.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.164
- Strokes her.
- You can stop right there, Chip.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.751
But I'm so alone, hidden down here.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.255
- The last human in existence.
- Don't start that again.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.056
- They've called this planet New Earth.
- A vegetable patch.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.762
And there's millions of humans out there,
millions of them.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.266
Mutant stock.

11:19.387 --> 11:23.233
They evolved, Cassandra, they just evolved.
Like they should.

11:23.349 --> 11:27.525
You stayed still, you got yourself
all pickled and preserved,

11:27.604 --> 11:29.322
and what good did it do you?

11:29.439 --> 11:33.660
I remember that night.
Drinks for the Ambassador of Thrace.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.823
That was the last time anyone told me
I was beautiful.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.661
After that, it all became such hard work.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.916
You've got a knack for survival,
I'll give you that.

11:43.995 --> 11:48.421
But I've not been idle, Rose.
Tucked away, underneath this hospital,

11:48.541 --> 11:52.341
I've been listening.
The Sisters are hiding something.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.096
What do you mean?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.595
These cats have secrets.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.811
Hush. Let me whisper, come close.

12:00.178 --> 12:04.274
You must be joking
if you think I'm coming anywhere near you.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.477
Chip! Activate the psycho-graft!

12:06.601 --> 12:09.480
I can't move. Cassandra, let me go!

12:11.272 --> 12:14.025
- What are you doing?
- The lady's moving on.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.996
It's goodbye trampoline and hello blondie!

12:31.042 --> 12:32.669
Mistress.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.255
Moisturise me.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.181
How bizarre. Arms.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.270
Fingers!

12:48.017 --> 12:49.234
Hair!

12:49.936 --> 12:52.030
Let me see, let me see.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.858
Oh, my God!

12:55.942 --> 12:58.036
I'm a chav.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.451
Hope, harmony and health.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.580
Hope, harmony and health.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.375
That's very kind. There's no need.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.628
- You're the one working.
- There's not much to do.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.085
Just maintain his smoke.

13:13.167 --> 13:17.263
And I suppose I'm company.
I can hear him singing sometimes,

13:18.089 --> 13:19.807
in my mind.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.769
Such ancient songs.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.638
Am I the only visitor?

13:24.721 --> 13:27.816
The rest of Boekind
became extinct long ago.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.606
He's the only one left.

13:30.727 --> 13:35.153
Legend says that the Face of Boe
has watched the universe grow old.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.281
There's all sorts of superstitions
around him.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.914
One story says that just before his death,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.913
the Face of Boe will
impart his great secret.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.380
That he will speak those words
only to one like himself.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.299
- What does that mean?
- It's just a story.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.259
Tell me the rest.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.715
It's said he'll talk to a wanderer.
To the man without a home.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.433
The lonely god.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.275
Look at me. From class to brass.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.982
Although...

14:14.479 --> 14:15.731
Ooh.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.576
Curves. Oh, baby!

14:19.650 --> 14:21.994
It's like living inside a bouncy castle.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.830
- The mistress is beautiful.
- Absolument.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.708
Oh, but look.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.329
Aw, the brain meat expired.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.420
My old mistress has gone.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.298
But safe and sound in here.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.050
But what of the Rose child's mind?

14:41.172 --> 14:44.642
Tucked away. I can just about access
the surface memory. She's...

14:47.553 --> 14:50.853
God, she's with the Doctor.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.479
That man, he's the Doctor.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.990
The same Doctor with a new face!

14:59.524 --> 15:01.151
That hypocrite!

15:01.776 --> 15:04.279
I must get the name of his surgeon.

15:04.362 --> 15:08.492
I could do with a little work. Although...

15:09.659 --> 15:12.082
nice rear bumper.

15:15.164 --> 15:19.044
Oh! It seems to be ringing.
Is it meant to ring?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.170
A primitive communications device.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.097
Rose, where are you?

15:23.172 --> 15:26.096
- How does she speak?
- Old Earth cockney.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.392
Um...

15:28.845 --> 15:30.313
- Wotcha.
- Where've you been?

15:30.388 --> 15:34.018
- How long does it take to get to ward 26?
- I'm on my way, guv'nor.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.730
I shall proceed up the apples and pears.

15:37.854 --> 15:41.734
You'll never guess!
I'm with the Face of Boe. Remember him?

15:42.859 --> 15:45.203
Of course I do.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.452
That big old... boat race.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.533
I'd better go. See you in a minute.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.540
I didn't think I was going to make it.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.874
It's that man again!
He's my good luck charm.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.593
Come in! Don't be shy.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.964
Any friendship expressed by
the Duke of Manhattan does not constitute

16:04.046 --> 16:06.845
- a form of legal contract.
- Winch me up!

16:08.384 --> 16:13.561
- Up! Look at me. No sign of infection.
- Champagne, sir?

16:13.890 --> 16:15.563
No, thanks.

16:15.641 --> 16:19.521
- You had petrifold regression, right?
- "Had" being the operative word.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.072
Past tense!

16:21.147 --> 16:23.366
Completely cured.

16:23.441 --> 16:27.491
- But that's impossible.
- Primitive species would accuse us of magic

16:27.570 --> 16:31.040
but it's merely
the tender application of science.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.076
How on earth did you cure him?

16:33.201 --> 16:35.420
How on New Earth, you might say.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.210
- What's in that solution?
- A simple remedy.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.632
Then tell me what it is.

16:39.749 --> 16:43.128
I'm sorry. Patient confidentiality.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.631
I don't believe we've met.
My name is Matron Casp.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.928
I'm the Doctor.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.601
I think you'll find
that we are the doctors here.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.099
Matron Casp,
you're needed in intensive care.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.223
If you would excuse me.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.316
It's happened again.
One of the patients is conscious.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.522
Well, we can't have that.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.528
This Doctor man is dangerous.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.284
Dangerous and clever.

17:07.401 --> 17:11.031
I might need a mind like his.
The Sisterhood is up to something.

17:11.113 --> 17:15.367
Remember that old Earth saying?
"Never trust a nun..."

17:15.451 --> 17:19.580
"never trust a nurse and
never trust a cat."

17:19.664 --> 17:20.961
Perfume?

17:26.212 --> 17:29.136
It was having a perfectly
normal blood-wash,

17:29.257 --> 17:33.012
then all of a sudden it started crying.
It's this one.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.389
Please.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.100
- Look at its eyes. So alive.
- Help me.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.811
- Positively sparkling.
- Please.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.069
- Where am I?
- And speech.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.149
How can it even have a vocabulary?

17:47.316 --> 17:50.820
Sister Corvin has written a thesis
on the migration of sentience.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.908
She calls it The Echo of Life.
It's well worth a read.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.538
Help me.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.836
I've seen enough, thank you.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.754
If this happens again, we might
have to review our brainstem policy.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.929
- And what should we do with the patient?
- Standard procedure. Incinerate.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.731
Ambient temperature
stands at 74 degrees cohezic.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.647
Repeal', 74 degrees cohezic.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.776
This temperature is designed to promote
healing and well-being.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.025
There you are.
Come and look at this patient.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.112
Marconi's disease.
Should take years to recover.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.162
Two days. I've never seen anything like it.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.375
They've invented a cell-washing cascade.
It's amazing.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.166
Their medical science is way advanced.
And this one.

18:41.245 --> 18:45.170
Pallidome pancrosis.
Kills you in ten minutes, and he's fine.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.470
I need to find a terminal.
I've got to see how they do this.

18:49.545 --> 18:53.550
'Cause if they've got the best medicine
in the world, then why is it such a secret?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.886
I can't Adam and Eve it.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.938
What... What's with the voice?

18:59.055 --> 19:02.559
I don't know, just larking about.
New Earth.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.566
New me.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.531
Well, I can talk. New new Doctor.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.275
Mmm, aren't you just?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.999
Terminal's this way.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.503
Yeah, still got it.

19:31.545 --> 19:35.015
No, nothing odd. Surgery. Post-op.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.596
Nanodentistry.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.724
No sign of a shop. They should have a shop.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.430
No, it's missing something else.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.273
When I was downstairs,
those nurse-cat-nuns

19:43.349 --> 19:46.523
were talking about intensive care,
but where is it?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.070
You're right. Well done.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.944
Why would they hide a whole department?

19:51.941 --> 19:54.740
It's got to be there somewhere.
Search the subframe.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.862
What if the subframe's locked?

19:56.946 --> 19:58.789
Try the installation protocol.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.037
Yeah. Course. Sorry.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.298
Intensive care.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.305
Certainly looks intensive.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.477
That's disgusting. What's wrong with him?

21:06.223 --> 21:07.600
I'm sorry.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.024
I'm so sorry.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.251
What disease is that?

21:29.872 --> 21:31.294
All of them.

21:31.373 --> 21:35.594
Every single disease in the galaxy.
They've been infected with everything.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.089
What about us? Are we safe?

21:39.173 --> 21:41.892
The air's sterile. just don't touch them.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.061
How many patients are there?

21:52.186 --> 21:53.984
They're not patients.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.485
But they're sick.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.941
They were born sick.

21:57.066 --> 22:00.161
They're meant to be sick.
They exist to be sick.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.579
Lab rats.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.827
No wonder the Sisters
have got a cure for everything.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.034
They've built
the ultimate research laboratory.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.084
A human farm!

22:08.577 --> 22:10.329
Why don't they just die?

22:11.580 --> 22:15.050
Plague carriers. The last to go.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.470
It's for the greater cause.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.260
Novice Hame.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.138
When you took your vows,
did you agree to this?

22:23.217 --> 22:25.640
The Sisterhood has sworn to help.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.689
- What, by killing?
- But they're not real people.

22:28.848 --> 22:33.228
They're specially grown.
They have no proper existence.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.821
What's the turnover?

22:35.938 --> 22:40.444
A thousand a day? Thousand the next?
Thousand the next? How many thousands?

22:40.526 --> 22:42.904
For how many years? How many?

22:42.987 --> 22:45.160
Mankind needed us.

22:45.239 --> 22:49.710
They came to this planet
with so many illnesses, we couldn't cope.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.789
We did try. We tried everything.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.758
We tried using clone meat and bio-cattle,

22:56.834 --> 22:59.007
but the results were too slow.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.805
So the Sisterhood grew its own flesh.

23:02.673 --> 23:05.017
That's all they are. Flesh.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.636
These people are alive.

23:06.760 --> 23:11.266
But think of those humans
out there, healthy,

23:11.390 --> 23:13.484
and happy, because of us.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.733
If they live because of this
then life is worthless.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.066
But who are you to decide that?

23:20.190 --> 23:21.658
I'm the Doctor.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.705
And if you don't like it, if you want to take
it to a higher authority, there isn't one.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.577
It stops with me.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.333
Just to confirm...

23:30.409 --> 23:33.037
none of the humans in the city
actually know about this?

23:33.120 --> 23:36.750
- We thought it best not...
- Hold on. I can understand the bodies,

23:36.832 --> 23:39.961
I can understand your vows,
but one thing I can't understand.

23:40.044 --> 23:43.014
- What have you done to Rose?
- I don't know what you mean.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.886
And I'm being very, very calm.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.975
You want to be aware of that.
Very, very calm.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.345
And the only reason
I'm being so very, very calm

23:49.428 --> 23:52.022
is that the brain is a delicate thing.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.813
Whatever you've done to Rose's head,
I want it reversed.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.644
We haven't done anything.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.105
I'm perfectly fine.

23:59.188 --> 24:02.192
These people are dying
and Rose would care.

24:04.026 --> 24:08.281
All right, clever clogs. Smarty-pants.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.123
- Ladykiller.
- What's happened to you?

24:13.202 --> 24:15.625
I knew something
was going on in this hospital

24:15.704 --> 24:20.551
but I needed this body
and your mind to find it out.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.094
Who are you?

24:24.546 --> 24:26.219
The last human.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.424
Cassandra?

24:27.549 --> 24:29.847
Wake up and smell the perfume.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.057
You've hurt him.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.813
I don't understand.
I'll have to fetch Matron.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.815
You do that 'cause I want to see her.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.443
Now run along! Sound the alarm!

24:46.527 --> 24:49.531
- Matron, it's that man and the girl.
- We heard the alarm.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.332
Now, get back to work.
Tend to your patients.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.002
Let me out! Let me out!

25:03.085 --> 25:07.386
Aren't you lucky there was a spare?
Standing room only.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.057
You've stolen Rose's body!

25:09.133 --> 25:13.604
Over the years, I've thought of
a thousand ways to kill you, Doctor.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.809
And now that's exactly what I've got.
One thousand diseases.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.527
They pump the patients with a top-up
every 10 minutes.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.606
You've got about three minutes left.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.111
Enjoy.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.655
- Just let Rose go, Cassandra.
- I will.

25:27.776 --> 25:31.781
As soon as I find someone
younger and Less common.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.913
Then I'll junk her with the waste.
Now hush-a-bye.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.585
It's showtime.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.958
Anything we can do to help?

25:39.079 --> 25:42.128
Straight to the point, whiskers.
I want money.

25:42.249 --> 25:46.800
The Sisterhood is a charity,
we don't give money. We only accept.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.632
The humans across the water
pay you a fortune,

25:49.715 --> 25:51.513
and that's exactly what I need.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.471
A one-off payment, that's all I want.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.264
Oh, and perhaps a yacht,
in return for which

25:57.389 --> 26:01.394
I will tell the city
nothing of your institutional murder.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.813
- Is that a deal?
- I'm afraid not.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.111
I'd really advise you to think about this.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.111
Oh, there's no need. I have to decline.

26:10.194 --> 26:13.073
I'll tell them.
And you've no way of stopping me.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.829
You're not exactly nuns with guns.
You're not even armed.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.629
Who needs arms when we have claws?

26:21.955 --> 26:24.458
Well, nice try. Chip, plan B!

26:35.511 --> 26:36.933
What have you done?

26:37.012 --> 26:39.982
Gave the system a shot of adrenalin,
just to wake them up. See ya!

26:40.057 --> 26:43.061
Don't touch them!
Whatever you do, don't touch!

26:44.853 --> 26:46.696
Save us.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.617
I think we should withdraw.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.241
We understood what you did to us.

26:54.113 --> 26:58.368
As part of the machine,
we know the machine.

26:58.492 --> 27:02.292
Fascinating. It's actually
constructing an argument.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.131
And we will end it.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.104
Save us.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.860
They're free.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.818
By the goddess Santori!

27:32.359 --> 27:33.906
The ﬂesh is free!

27:36.405 --> 27:38.407
Stop the pain.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.552
Oh, my God!

27:54.673 --> 27:56.550
- What the hell have you done?
- It wasn't me.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.351
One touch
and you get every disease in the world.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.976
And I want that body safe, Cassandra.
We've got to go down.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.224
But there's thousands of them.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.608
Down, down, go down!

28:08.770 --> 28:10.568
Quarantine the building!

28:10.647 --> 28:12.900
This building is under quarantine.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.664
Repeat, this building is under quarantine.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.709
No one may leave the premises.

28:21.783 --> 28:25.538
Repeat, no one may leave the premises.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.377
Keep going! Go down!

28:36.006 --> 28:38.350
Help us. Save us.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.970
Help me!

28:57.194 --> 29:00.619
No, the lifts have closed down.
There's a quarantine, nothing's moving.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.207
This way!

29:07.746 --> 29:08.998
Don't let them touch you!

29:09.081 --> 29:11.925
Leave him! This is a clone thing.
He's only got a half-life. Come on!

29:12.000 --> 29:14.924
- Mistress!
- I'm sorry, I can't let her escape.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.676
My mistress!

29:26.348 --> 29:28.851
Excuse me, can we get some service?

29:47.202 --> 29:49.705
We're trapped! What are we going to do?

29:49.830 --> 29:52.549
Well, for starters,
you're going to leave that body.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.377
That psycho-graft is banned
on every civilised planet.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.425
You're compressing Rose to death.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.640
But I've got nowhere to go.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.968
My original skin's dead.

30:02.050 --> 30:06.055
Not my problem. You can float
as atoms in the air. Now get out.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.983
Give her back to me.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.685
You asked for it.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.653
Blimey, my head.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.906
Where did she go?

30:23.989 --> 30:27.994
Oh my, this is... different.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.913
- Cassandra?
- Goodness me, I'm a man.

30:30.996 --> 30:35.251
Yum. So many parts. And hardly used.

30:36.585 --> 30:39.088
Oh! Ah! Two hearts!

30:39.755 --> 30:41.849
Oh, baby, I'm beating out a samba.

30:41.923 --> 30:45.052
- Get out of him!
- Ooh, he's slim.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.228
And a little bit foxy.

30:47.304 --> 30:51.150
You thought so, too.
I've been inside your head.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.439
You've been looking.

30:54.478 --> 30:56.105
You like it.

30:57.856 --> 31:01.611
What do we do? What would he do?
The Doctor! What the hell would he do?

31:01.735 --> 31:03.362
Ladder. We've got to get up.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.243
Out of the way, blondie!

31:05.947 --> 31:10.327
Please! Help us!

31:35.644 --> 31:38.397
If you get out of the Doctor's body,
he can think of something.

31:39.981 --> 31:43.611
God, it was tedious inside your head.
Hormone city.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.162
But we're gonna die if... Ow!

31:47.114 --> 31:48.206
Get off!

31:48.323 --> 31:51.076
All our good work. All that healing.

31:51.159 --> 31:55.915
The good name of the Sisterhood.
You have destroyed everything!

31:55.997 --> 31:59.843
- Go and play with a ball of string.
- Everywhere, disease.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.800
This is the human world. Sickness!

32:15.809 --> 32:17.106
Move!

32:18.311 --> 32:21.611
Maximum quarantine.
Divert all shuttles.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.069
Help us.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.781
- Now what do we do?
- Use the sonic screwdriver.

32:28.864 --> 32:31.413
- You mean this thing?
- Yes, I mean that thing!

32:31.533 --> 32:34.161
But I don't know how!
That Doctor's hidden away all his thoughts.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.838
Cassandra, go back into me.
The Doctor can open it.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.085
Do it!

32:38.206 --> 32:39.628
Hold on tight.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.716
Oh, chav-tastic again.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.722
- Open it!
- Not till you get out of her!

32:49.801 --> 32:53.055
- We need the Doctor.
- I order you to leave her!

32:56.558 --> 33:00.233
No matter how difficult the situation,
there is no need to shout.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.988
Cassandra, get out of him!

33:02.063 --> 33:04.407
But if I go into you, he simply refuses.
He's so rude.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.777
I don't care, just do something!

33:07.736 --> 33:09.534
Oh, I'm so going to regret this.

33:14.242 --> 33:17.917
Oh, sweet Lord! I look disgusting.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.591
- Nice to have you back.
- No, you don't.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.468
That is your last warning, Cassandra.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.599
Inside her head...

33:31.593 --> 33:33.470
They're so alone.

33:33.595 --> 33:36.064
They keep reaching out, just to hold us.

33:38.308 --> 33:42.438
All their lives
and they've never been touched.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.004
We're safe, we're safe, we're safe!
We're clean, we're clean! Look, look.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.556
- Show me your skin.
- Look! Clean! Look!

34:09.630 --> 34:11.975
If we'd been touched, we'd be dead.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.308
How's it going up here? What's the status?

34:15.428 --> 34:18.523
Nothing but silence from the other wards.
I think we're the only ones left.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.565
I've been trying to
override the quarantine.

34:20.641 --> 34:24.237
If I can trip a signal over to New New York,
they can send a private executive squad.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.985
You can't do that. If they forced entry,
they'd break quarantine.

34:27.107 --> 34:28.609
I am not dying in here.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.739
We can't let
a single particle of disease get out.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.369
There's 10 million people in that city,
they'd all be at risk. Now turn that off.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.911
Not if it gets me out.

34:35.991 --> 34:39.746
All right, fine. So I have to
stop you Lot as well. Suits me.

34:39.828 --> 34:43.002
Rose, Novice Hame, everyone!
Excuse me, Your Grace.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.676
Get me the intravenous solutions
for every single disease! Move it!

35:01.391 --> 35:04.816
- How's that? Will that do?
- I don't know. Will it do for what?

35:04.894 --> 35:06.862
The lifts aren't working...

35:07.689 --> 35:09.316
Not moving, different thing.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.284
Here we go.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.112
But you're not going to...

35:15.697 --> 35:17.495
What do you think you're doing?

35:22.579 --> 35:23.876
Come on.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.837
Not in a million years.

35:25.915 --> 35:29.636
I need another pair of hands.
What do you think?

35:29.711 --> 35:33.056
If you're so desperate to stay alive,
why don't you live a little?

35:34.257 --> 35:36.009
Seal the door!

35:36.343 --> 35:37.845
Help.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.395
No!

35:42.140 --> 35:45.440
You're completely mad.
I can see why she likes you.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.062
Going down!

36:01.201 --> 36:02.919
Well, that's one way to lose weight.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.088
Now, listen.
When I say so, take hold of that lever.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.040
There's still a quarantine down there.
We can't...

36:07.123 --> 36:08.796
Hold that lever!

36:08.917 --> 36:12.512
I'm cooking up a cocktail.
I know a bit about medicine myself.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.021
Now, that lever's gonna resist,
but keep it in position.

36:26.059 --> 36:29.063
- Hold on to it with everything you've got.
- What about you?

36:29.145 --> 36:30.825
I've got an appointment. The Doctor is in.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.115
I'm in here! Come on!

36:40.198 --> 36:41.575
Don't tell them!

36:41.658 --> 36:43.126
Pull that lever!

36:45.036 --> 36:47.915
Come and get me! Come on.
I'm in here! Come on!

36:49.457 --> 36:53.052
- Commence stage one disinfection.
- Come and get me. Come on!

36:56.297 --> 36:57.844
Come on. Come on.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.232
All they want to do is pass it on.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.729
Pass it on!

37:07.851 --> 37:09.148
Pass on what?

37:09.352 --> 37:11.104
Pass on what?

37:11.187 --> 37:12.564
Pass it on!

37:50.435 --> 37:54.440
What did they pass on? Did you kill them?
All of them?

37:54.522 --> 37:57.947
No, that's your way of doing things.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.244
I'm the Doctor and I cured them.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.790
That's right. Hey! There we go, sweetheart.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.420
Hey?

38:13.917 --> 38:17.296
Go to him. Go. That's it. That's it.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.976
It's a new subspecies, Cassandra.
A brand-new form of life.

38:23.551 --> 38:26.100
New humans. Look at them! Look!

38:26.763 --> 38:31.109
Run by cats, kept in the
dark, fed by tubes,

38:31.184 --> 38:34.529
but completely, completely alive!

38:34.729 --> 38:37.733
You can't deny them
'cause you helped create them.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.069
The human race just keeps on going.

38:41.194 --> 38:44.243
Keeps on changing. Life will out.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.283
Ha!

38:46.908 --> 38:50.538
This is the NNYPD.
Please step away from the shuttles.

38:50.620 --> 38:54.670
All staff will present themselves
to the officers for immediate arrest.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.502
I repeat. Immediate arrest.

38:57.585 --> 39:01.260
All new life forms will be catalogued
and taken into care.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.510
All visitors to the hospital will be
required to make a statement

39:05.593 --> 39:07.937
to the NNYPD.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.772
The Face of Boe!

39:20.942 --> 39:22.569
You were supposed to be dying.

39:22.694 --> 39:26.415
There are better things to do today.
Dying can wait.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.583
Oh, I hate telepathy.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.040
Just what I need, a head full of big-face.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.286
Shh!

39:32.370 --> 39:34.668
I had grown tired with
the universe, Doctor,

39:34.747 --> 39:37.876
but you have taught me to look at it anew.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.712
There are legends, you know,

39:40.795 --> 39:42.968
saying that you're millions of years old.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.183
Well, now, that would be impossible.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.851
Wouldn't it just?

39:46.926 --> 39:50.556
I got the impression there was
something you wanted to tell me.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.106
A great secret.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.149
So the legend says.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.477
It can wait.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.278
Oh, does it have to?

39:57.395 --> 40:02.071
We shall meet again, Doctor,
for the third time, for the last time,

40:02.191 --> 40:03.864
and the truth shall be told.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.371
Until that day...

40:11.951 --> 40:13.624
That is enigmatic.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.214
That is... that is textbook enigmatic.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.461
And now for you.

40:22.420 --> 40:28.348
But everything's happy.
Everything's fine. Can't you just leave me?

40:28.426 --> 40:29.848
You've lived long enough.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.982
Leave that body and end it, Cassandra.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.314
I don't want to die.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.610
No one does.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.780
- Help me.
- I can't.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.357
Mistress...

40:42.440 --> 40:44.158
Oh! You're alive!

40:44.233 --> 40:47.533
I kept myself safe for you, mistress.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.618
A body!

40:50.698 --> 40:53.121
And not just that. A volunteer!

40:53.201 --> 40:55.078
Don't you dare! He's got a life of his own.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.414
But I worship the mistress.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.881
I welcome her.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.841
You can't, Cassandra. You...

41:03.127 --> 41:04.549
Oh! You all right?

41:07.590 --> 41:08.762
Okay?

41:10.802 --> 41:12.054
Yeah.

41:13.262 --> 41:14.309
Hello.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.391
Hello. Welcome back.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.398
Oh, sweet Lord! I'm a walking doodle.

41:19.686 --> 41:22.986
You can't stay in there.
I'm sorry, Cassandra, but that's not fair.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.237
I can take you to the city.
They can build you a skin-tank,

41:25.316 --> 41:27.489
and you can stand trial
for what you've done.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.991
Well, that would be rather dramatic.

41:30.113 --> 41:33.208
Possibly my finest hour,
and certainly my finest hat.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.034
But I'm afraid we don't have time.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.041
Poor little Chip, he's only a half-life.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.545
And he's been through so much.
His heart is racing so.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.799
He's failing.
I don't think he's going to last...

41:44.877 --> 41:47.255
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.181
I'm dying.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.976
But that's fine.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.355
I can take you to the city.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.772
No, you won't.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.604
Everything's new on this planet.

42:03.688 --> 42:06.362
There's no place for Chip and me anymore.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.408
You were right, Doctor.

42:11.487 --> 42:12.864
It's time to die.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.083
And that's good.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.125
Come on, there's one last thing I can do.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.313
Oh, no don't!

42:43.144 --> 42:45.488
That's simply not true.

42:45.605 --> 42:48.074
And believe me, it was so dismal.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.197
And the mosquitoes, I can't tell you.
They were...

42:50.276 --> 42:52.074
Thank you.

42:52.153 --> 42:55.032
Just go. And don't look back.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.662
Good luck.

43:07.585 --> 43:12.056
And if you actually see them, you're shot!
But don't quote me on that.

43:14.092 --> 43:17.096
- A bientot.
- Excuse me, the Lady Cassandra?

43:17.178 --> 43:19.772
I'm sorry, I don't need anything right now.
I'm fine, thank you.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.021
No, I just wanted to say...
you look beautiful.

43:25.311 --> 43:29.236
Well. That's very kind,
you strange little thing.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.321
Thank you very much.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.822
I mean it.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.075
You look...

43:40.368 --> 43:41.870
so beautiful.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.213
Thank you.

43:52.213 --> 43:56.059
Oh, my Lord. Are you all right?
What is it? What's wrong?

43:56.134 --> 43:57.886
Someone get some help!

43:58.010 --> 44:00.479
Call a medic or something, quickly.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.899
I don't know, he just came up to me.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.483
Don't even know his name.

44:04.559 --> 44:09.190
He just collapsed.
I think he's dying. Someone do something!

44:09.480 --> 44:13.576
I've got you, sweetheart. It's all right.
There you are.

44:13.901 --> 44:16.074
There you are. I've got you.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.994
It'll be alright. There, there.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.746
You poor little thing.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.841
Might I introduce
Her Majesty Queen Victoria?

44:43.890 --> 44:46.439
Every full moon,
the howling rings through the valley.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.940
This is a man who becomes an animal.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.192
A werewolf?

44:50.271 --> 44:52.273
But it can't be an actual wolf.

45:00.990 --> 45:02.367
Bullets can't stop it!
