00:05.999 --> 00:07.332
Girl, I always wanted
to have a hoe phase.

00:07.332 --> 00:08.124
(GIGGLES)
Sorry.

00:08.749 --> 00:10.291
ISSA DEE:
I'm just stuck in my own head.

00:10.291 --> 00:11.207
Can you teach me
how to hoe?

00:11.207 --> 00:12.332
Bitch, that's rude.

00:12.332 --> 00:13.207
And yes.

00:14.374 --> 00:15.749
Green shirt, that's all you.

00:17.332 --> 00:19.291
Girl, will you hurry
your slow walking ass up?

01:04.915 --> 01:07.249
- You still not ready yet?
- Girl, you know it's a process.

01:07.249 --> 01:09.832
Well, can you hurry up?
'Cause Kiss-n-Grind
starts at 3:00

01:09.832 --> 01:13.249
and there's road closures
for some 24-hour
bike ride thing.

01:13.249 --> 01:15.124
Girl, I've been drinking
to pass the time.

01:15.124 --> 01:16.790
( whispers )
And a lot of time
has passed.

01:16.790 --> 01:18.832
Well, it's a good thing
I brought-- ah!

01:18.832 --> 01:20.332
Didn't I bring that

01:31.957 --> 01:34.332
- You right.

and the dance floor.

01:34.332 --> 01:36.999
- Hey!

01:36.999 --> 01:39.332

01:57.790 --> 01:59.999
- You trying to fuck a cat?
- Girl, I'm just trying to fuck.

01:59.999 --> 02:02.708
- Okay, what about neighbor bae?
- Oh, I'm still keeping him
around.

02:02.708 --> 02:04.874
- That's why I didn't
wanna meet Felix--
- Cat bae.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.124

02:26.666 --> 02:29.291

- Where?!

08:42.458 --> 08:43.874
- Don't look for him!
- Ow!

08:45.332 --> 08:47.249
- Did he see you?
- I mean, maybe.

08:47.249 --> 08:50.082
Depends on
how good that nigga's
peripheral vision is.

08:50.082 --> 08:52.499
I bet it's good, though,
because he got Lasik
a year ago, so--

08:52.499 --> 08:54.166
So, do you
wanna leave?

08:54.166 --> 08:57.374
No, I'm just annoyed that
I gotta deal with this shit.

we gotta get out of LA.

17:59.332 --> 18:01.124
Traditional marriage,
that shit just didn't
work for us.

18:01.124 --> 18:02.708
You got married
in a church.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.583
I didn't expect things
to go this way either.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.458
- ( scoffs )
- Look, look,
it's a lot of pressure.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.166
To be all things
to one person?

18:09.166 --> 18:10.458
- Come on.
- Well, then make friends!

18:10.458 --> 18:12.291
You just can't be
out here cheating--

18:12.291 --> 18:14.499
But it isn't cheating.
We're very honest
with each other.

18:14.499 --> 18:15.583
Isn't that how
relationships work?

18:17.458 --> 18:19.374
- I mean, I guess.
- Yeah.

18:19.374 --> 18:21.708
It's not like we out
in these streets,
hoing around.

18:21.708 --> 18:25.332
But if something happens,
yo, it happens.

18:28.291 --> 18:29.957
( sighs )
I don't know.

18:29.957 --> 18:33.790
Look, people just
need to figure out
what works for them.

18:33.790 --> 18:38.583
And this works
for us.

Why are you
on the phone?

19:04.458 --> 19:06.332
Who are you texting?

19:06.332 --> 19:09.915
Uh, it's just my boy
that I was supposed
to meet up with.

19:09.915 --> 19:10.832

Y'all,
my motherfucking life.

21:17.832 --> 21:19.999
Dro hit on me,
hard.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.957
- Like he's trying to fuck.
- What?!

21:21.957 --> 21:23.332
What the fuck?
Why would he do that?

21:23.332 --> 21:25.166
He said he and Candice
are in an open marriage.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.957
Dro? Like, Dro, Dro?
Dro who we know?

21:27.957 --> 21:30.207
Shit, I didn't even know,
and I do their taxes.

21:30.207 --> 21:32.499
- So, they both step out?
- Damn, that's progressive
as fuck.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.957
- Or is it messy as fuck?
- I thought that was some
white people shit.

21:34.957 --> 21:36.291
I know!

21:36.291 --> 21:39.207
- Mm.
- ( Issa exhales )

21:39.207 --> 21:42.832
Well, as long as
they're both being honest.

21:42.832 --> 21:44.708
He said they are.

21:44.708 --> 21:48.374
I mean, I guess it's better
than doing shit behind
your person's back--

21:48.374 --> 21:51.166
lying, cheating,
moving out.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.999
- You talking about you.
- I'm not talking about
anybody specifically.

21:53.999 --> 21:55.332
You talking about you
specifically.

21:55.332 --> 21:59.458
Damn, is anyone married
like my parents anymore?

21:59.458 --> 22:01.166
- Derek and Tiffany are.
- Mmm.

22:01.166 --> 22:04.166
Maybe, but how
do we know what happens
in their marriage?

22:04.166 --> 22:06.790
Tiffany said that Derek
lived in a hotel last year.

22:06.790 --> 22:10.166
Could I fuck Derek?
Would I fuck Derek?

22:10.166 --> 22:11.624
Should I fuck Derek?

22:11.624 --> 22:15.458
So, are you
considering this?

22:15.458 --> 22:18.708
No!
Girl, it's Dro.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.374
Like, we grew up
together

22:20.374 --> 22:23.040
and, yes, we kissed
in middle school, but,
like, that's it.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.458
And if it was
ever gonna happen,
it would not be like this.

22:25.458 --> 22:29.040
- Yeah, but if he were
some guy on the street...
- Like Derek.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.374
- ...would you consider it then?
- But he's not just a guy.

22:31.374 --> 22:33.874
He's married,
so that's not even
on the table.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.374
Well, now he wants
to fuck you on this table.

Oh, fuck, yes.
It's so fucking huge.

22:53.249 --> 22:55.790
Oh, I'm so wet.
Make me squirt.

23:22.249 --> 23:25.332

I want some, too.

23:25.332 --> 23:27.249
Yeah, okay.

- ( sighs )
- ( moans )

23:37.832 --> 23:39.708
Ugh, he's soft.

23:39.708 --> 23:43.416
Wait, I can't
just go right again.

23:43.416 --> 23:45.124
Well, then
why'd you come?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.790
Because
we were fucking?

23:47.790 --> 23:51.124
( scoffs )
This is bullshit.

23:51.124 --> 23:53.374
Wait, no, no, no, no!
Look, look, look, look.

23:53.374 --> 23:56.207
I just need a breath,
you know, just a minute,
and I can get him back up.

23:56.207 --> 23:58.124
Just give me a second.

23:58.124 --> 24:00.458
( panting )

24:04.124 --> 24:08.708
- You-- you're just gonna
stare at me like that?
- What's the problem?

24:08.708 --> 24:11.790
We've been with
a bunch of other black guys
who can come and keep going.

24:11.790 --> 24:14.124
A bunch?

24:14.124 --> 24:16.458
You know
who could fuck?

24:16.458 --> 24:18.207
LaMarcus.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.957
Oh, my gosh.

24:19.957 --> 24:22.499

was fucking crazy.

24:27.416 --> 24:30.915

pad thai place
that we went to after?

Well, let's just
go to the place
on the corner.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.332
- It'll be faster.
- Mm-hmm.

24:41.332 --> 24:43.040
Oh, we could still
make Michelle's party.

Best night
of my damn life!

24:59.249 --> 25:01.583
Mine was
the exact opposite.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.541
Oh, so my guy,
John?

25:03.541 --> 25:05.957
James-- you know what?
Let's just call him Sweetie.

25:05.957 --> 25:08.458
Sweetie and his friends
are going to Swingers,
and so are we.

25:08.458 --> 25:10.040
Great, 'cause
I'm starving.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.749
Molly, can you
put this on my tab?

25:11.749 --> 25:13.708
- Yeah, no, I got it.
- Yes!

25:16.583 --> 25:20.374
- Hey, I'll
catch up with you guys.
- All right, hurry up.

25:24.708 --> 25:28.291
- Hey.
- Uh, we're about
to head out.

25:28.291 --> 25:30.207
Yeah, yeah,
me, too.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.374
So, what's next?

25:36.957 --> 25:41.541
Um, I'm about to go grab
some food with Issa and Kelli.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.040
Okay.

25:45.249 --> 25:46.124
Then what?

25:47.957 --> 25:49.957
I guess home.

25:49.957 --> 25:51.624
Maybe I'll
text you later.

25:53.416 --> 25:54.708
Okay.

already have a table?

26:11.541 --> 26:13.040
'Cause this right here,
I can't.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.915
Bitch, we just got here.
Don't fuck this up for me.

26:14.915 --> 26:18.915
- Ooh, he's in the back.
- Thank God. My feet hurt.

26:18.915 --> 26:22.082
These goddamn wedges.
I hate these shoes.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.291
There they go.

26:25.291 --> 26:28.082
- Hey, Sweetie!
- Girl, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

26:28.082 --> 26:29.624
Kelli:
Thanks for
saving us seats.

26:29.624 --> 26:31.082
Absolutely.
No worries.

26:31.082 --> 26:33.332
You're very welcome.
And here is a menu.

26:33.332 --> 26:35.124
You know what?
I don't need that.
I know what I want.

26:35.124 --> 26:36.999
It's my cheat day.
I want a root beer float.

26:36.999 --> 26:38.874
- Mm-hmm.
- Nothing but float!

26:38.874 --> 26:40.708
Sweetie:
So, do you clap
after all your sentences?

26:40.708 --> 26:42.624
You know what?
I do what I want.

26:42.624 --> 26:44.999
- ( Kelli giggles )
- Sweetie: Girl, I like it.

26:44.999 --> 26:46.874
- Kelli: Wait,
let's get a selfie.
- Let's do it.

26:46.874 --> 26:49.416
Kelli:
I gotta send it to my mom.
She's scared.

26:49.416 --> 26:51.541
( snorts )
But, like, what food
are you gonna order?

26:51.541 --> 26:53.040
- Like... Yeah!
- Sweetie: Oh, food!

26:53.040 --> 26:54.666
Can't go wrong
with your first choice.

26:54.666 --> 26:56.624
( crickets chirping )

27:00.624 --> 27:02.583

27:07.332 --> 27:08.957
Yo, is it still
going down?

27:08.957 --> 27:10.541
( scoffs )

27:10.541 --> 27:12.499
If it were, would I have
answered the phone?

27:12.499 --> 27:16.458
Nigga! I can't believe
you just met two bitches
at the grocery store.

27:16.458 --> 27:18.207
Did y'all fuck
with any of the food?

27:18.207 --> 27:20.332
I told you you was
gonna be the man, smashing
random bitches and shit.

27:20.332 --> 27:21.999
Was it great?
It was great, right?

27:21.999 --> 27:23.708
Yeah, it was...

27:25.458 --> 27:26.749
Yeah, it was great.

27:26.749 --> 27:28.832
Shit, nigga,
I knew it, I knew it!

27:28.832 --> 27:31.832
Yeah, yo,
we were kicking it
and drinking.

27:31.832 --> 27:35.166
Then I started making out
with one of 'em,

27:35.166 --> 27:36.749
then we were all
fucking.

27:36.749 --> 27:39.416
Then they started
doing coke,

27:39.416 --> 27:41.541
and then, you know,
they were hella hungry.

27:41.541 --> 27:42.915
Oh, nigga,
you wore 'em out!

27:42.915 --> 27:44.624
My man, 'Wrence!

- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

27:48.499 --> 27:51.416
- I am pretty worn out.
- All right, for sure.

27:51.416 --> 27:53.666
You know we got that
rec basketball game tomorrow,
