WEBVTT

00:43.001 --> 00:45.795
You can't say you don't deserve
what's about to happen, Emma.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.008
- Oh, you figured out my real name.
- I know your first name.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.636
I know you play the violin,

00:54.637 --> 00:55.972
and I know you die today.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.863
Wait! Look, there's smoke.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.075
There's fire on the other side,
and your nuke's in the middle of it.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.243
When that thing pops, it's all over.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.538
As much as I would love
to kill you right now, we need each other.

01:20.538 --> 01:23.792
Sadly, it's gonna take two of us
to get out of this place, or we both die.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.254
- What's your way out?
- That vent.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.465
We need to build a scaffold.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.094
So you can arrest me...
once we're on the surface?

01:35.178 --> 01:38.515
Once we get out, go our separate ways,
live to fight another day.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.850
I trusted you once,
and you backstabbed me.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.562
Well, shit, I...

01:44.562 --> 01:45.855
What other option do you have?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.543
God help you if you're playing games.

02:08.211 --> 02:12.841
Considering our situation,
I'll take any help God's handing out.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.764
Okay, Roo, you have to get him
into a sitting position.

02:19.764 --> 02:23.101
A 45-degree angle,
wound side, arm above his head.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.060
I feel dizzy.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.815
Well, you normally feel really horny,
so this is a new experience for you.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.026
Okay, but we gotta get this arm up.
Put it over your head, bud.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.946
- Hey, we've gotta move him now.
<i>-</i> <i>No.</i>

02:34.946 --> 02:37.031
Transporting him in this condition
could kill him.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.742
Once Roo re-inflates his lungs,
he'll be able to move on his own.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.785
<i>Then get it done.</i>

02:40.785 --> 02:42.954
- The whole place is gonna blow.
- Emma?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.998
Emma is probably trapped
from the explosion.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.291
-  Hey, hey.
- What?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.584
You go help him find her.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.043
No, she will take care of you.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.629
I'll look for Emma, okay?
Take care of him fast.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.672
Okay.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.301
Oh man,
I picked the wrong day to get high.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.803
It's like my nephew's bris all over again.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.888
Update.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.806
Temp readings are hot.

03:01.806 --> 03:04.100
We're maybe 15 minutes out
before detonation.

03:06.978 --> 03:07.812
Damn it.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.859
The whole basement has collapsed.
I can't find an access to the east wing.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.694
Easy, Luke. Boro's men could be anywhere.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.821
<i>There was an explosion
at one of the reactors,</i>

03:16.821 --> 03:17.989
so the guards are all gone.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.658
<i>It would take hours for the government
to do risk assessment</i>

03:20.658 --> 03:22.285
and to send the troops in.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.494
So I'm safe right now.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.871
<i>You don't have hours, Luke.</i>

03:24.871 --> 03:26.664
You've got 15 minutes at best.

03:26.664 --> 03:27.832
<i>Hard as it is,</i>

03:27.832 --> 03:30.627
I need an honest assessment
of the odds Emma's still alive.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.544
Why?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.546
You and two other officers
are in grave danger.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.257
- If there's no valid reason to remain--
- Fifty-fifty.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.967
I said an honest assessment.

03:41.804 --> 03:45.516
Based on the force of the blast
and the damage I saw...

03:47.185 --> 03:48.478
<i>maybe 10%.</i>

03:48.478 --> 03:50.104
But it's my daughter.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.773
My niece is tough as hell, Director.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.566
The blast was subterranean.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.819
- Above-ground floors are intact, right?
- Yeah, most of it is, yes.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.780
<i>So there could be air pockets.</i>

03:58.780 --> 04:01.658
If Emma's in one of them,
then she has a chance if she goes up.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.910
High windows, ventilation ducts.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.037
That's what you need to be
looking for, sir.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.247
<i>If Emma survived the blast,</i>

04:07.956 --> 04:08.998
that's how you'll find her.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.124
Fourteen minutes.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.252
Luke, I'm giving you 12,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.754
<i>then your orders are to abort.</i>

04:14.754 --> 04:17.173
Dot, I respect you,

04:18.007 --> 04:20.009
but you must be out of your fucking mind

04:20.009 --> 04:22.679
if you think that I'll leave here
without my kid.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.141
- I think it's stuck.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.310
- Come on. Push.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.276
All that time
Finn spent with you as a kid,

04:37.193 --> 04:38.820
he never taught you to work out?

04:38.820 --> 04:40.446
I was hurt in the explosion.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.782
Of course Finn trained with me.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.786
He read me Sun Tzu,

04:47.412 --> 04:49.122
introduced me to the Rolling Stones.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.540
It's funny.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.335
He looks at me like a dish
he can't stand the taste of,

04:56.462 --> 04:58.756
and he was the one that threw
the ingredients in the bowl.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.344
Emma!

05:11.144 --> 05:12.395
<i>The hose is sanitized.</i>

05:12.395 --> 05:15.773
Good. Now sterilize the area
between the fourth and fifth rib

05:15.773 --> 05:17.442
<i>on the wound side of the chest cavity.</i>

05:17.442 --> 05:19.902
- Why?
- That's where you'll make the incision.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.571
<i>Fuck you.</i>

05:21.571 --> 05:24.240
Roo, you have to drain the fluid
from his lungs.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.410
- You didn't tell me I had to cut him open.
- What did you think the hose was for?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
I thought he'd just blow on it maybe

05:29.370 --> 05:31.664
and stuff would just get
shot out of his chest.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.915
And the urine-filled jar?

05:32.915 --> 05:36.127
<i>I don't know. You're a weird guy.
I just went with it.</i>

05:36.127 --> 05:40.173
Damn it, Officer Russell,
get out your tac knife and do your job.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.841
I don't have my tac.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.051
All I have is my...

05:43.051 --> 05:44.802
...Roy Rogers Camper Buddy.

05:44.802 --> 05:48.306
- Where's your proper gear?
- One, I always have my dad's knife on me.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.767
Two, it's not my fault.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.811
My tac knife was in the vehicle I blew up.

05:53.811 --> 05:56.189
I guess technically that was my fault.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.565
Oh, Aldon.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.568
Oh my God.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.154
He's out cold. His pulse is thready.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.407
Listen, Roo, you've got to cut him open
or he's dead in minutes.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.457
Emma!

06:26.594 --> 06:27.553
Emma!

06:27.553 --> 06:29.138
Can you hear me?

06:44.654 --> 06:45.780
Lift with your legs.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.449
- Don't tell me how to lift.
- Fine, throw your back out.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.204
- What is that?
- Shh.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.373
EMMA?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.542
It's Morse code.

07:09.637 --> 07:15.226
YES. WITH BORO.

07:16.018 --> 07:16.978
Thank God.

07:16.978 --> 07:17.895
She's alive.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.648
<i>Clock's still ticking.</i>

07:20.648 --> 07:23.901
<i>Luke, can you get Emma out of there
and complete task on Boro?</i>

07:23.901 --> 07:25.111
I don't know.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.531
WE'RE CLIMBING TO VENT.

07:30.783 --> 07:37.790
ONLY 10 MINUTES.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.041
HURRY!

07:40.543 --> 07:41.919
- Is that Finn Hoss?
- Yeah.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.171
What did he say?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.006
You should shut up and get back to work,
so we don't die.

07:45.006 --> 07:45.923
Let's go.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.513
Three... four... five.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.557
<i>- Okay, I found it.</i>
-  Good.

07:54.557 --> 07:58.352
Now take the sterilized knife,
make a one-inch incision.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.111
Are... Are you crying?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.990
I'm scared. I can't lose another one.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.743
Roo, we're not certain
we've lost anyone yet.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.787
You're not talking about Emma, are you?

08:17.747 --> 08:21.250
Roo, why do you carry
your dad's pocketknife around with you?

08:24.253 --> 08:25.880
I didn't think he would get in trouble.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.883
He told me it was his medicine
and not to touch it,

08:28.883 --> 08:30.635
but they were cops.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.722
And the cops asked you
where your dad kept, what,

08:35.348 --> 08:36.432
the drugs he sold?

08:36.974 --> 08:38.059
<i>I was seven.</i>

08:41.437 --> 08:44.982
I cannot lose another one
and have it be my fault.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.068
<i>You know what I think, Roo?</i>

08:47.568 --> 08:50.780
I think you're afraid you're going to lose
Aldon, a man you love,

08:50.780 --> 08:52.490
just like you loved your father,

08:53.074 --> 08:55.409
<i>and you don't wanna be responsible again.</i>

08:55.409 --> 08:57.662
Your dad didn't go to prison
because of you.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.413
You were a child.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.166
And Aldon's not going to die
because of you either.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.668
<i>You're not seven.</i>

09:04.168 --> 09:06.254
<i>You're a brave and capable woman,</i>

09:06.254 --> 09:08.839
and you are not
going to let your friend down.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.300
Now make the cut.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.817
Okay... the incision is made.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.570
-  Way to go, doc!

09:30.570 --> 09:32.863
That was some
Sigmund Freud shit right there!

09:45.585 --> 09:48.004
- Luke, where are we?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.633
There's a vent with a metal cap.
I'm trying to remove it.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.635
- Eight minutes to go.
<i>-</i> <i>Tops.</i>

09:54.635 --> 09:57.013
Respectfully, sir,
you've gotta Hulk-out on that shit.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.154
Whatever he's trying to do,
he won't do it in time.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.655
He won't stop until he gets me out.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.116
Forgive me
if I don't have the same trust in the man.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.660
He single-handedly destroyed my life.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.120
Just grab that box.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.416
You know, you're a whiny little bitch,
you know that?

10:25.916 --> 10:26.751
Excuse me?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.837
"Finn Hoss put
all my ingredients in the bowl."

10:29.837 --> 10:31.672
"Finn Hoss destroyed my life."

10:31.672 --> 10:34.842
You don't think some of your choices
put you in your current situation?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.218
Let's see.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.597
Murdering my father, his choice.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.642
Sending me to boarding school
away from the only world I knew,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.018
his choice.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.687
Destroying my life's work, his choice.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.440
- Finn Hoss--
- Finn Hoss is not your problem!

10:49.440 --> 10:51.108
Boro Polonia's made millions of decisions

10:51.108 --> 10:53.694
that got him stuck in a basement
with a nuke that's about to blow.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.946
For Christ's sake,
take some responsibility.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.616
Stop blaming him for all of your mistakes.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.204
Wow, that's really good advice.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.040
I'm glad you're so impressed
with the wisdom you've bestowed.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.668
Let's get the fuck out of here
before we get blown to hell.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.753
Yeah.

11:20.304 --> 11:21.639
His breath is still shallow.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.641
- He's not getting better.
<i>-</i> <i>He will.</i>

11:23.641 --> 11:26.686
As fluid escapes his pleural cavity,
negative pressure rises,

11:26.686 --> 11:27.770
and his lung will inflate.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.438
How will I know when that happens?

11:37.071 --> 11:37.905
Hey, Roo.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.657
'Sup?

11:47.289 --> 11:49.208
There's a huge hose hanging out of me.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.168
That's what you told your doctor.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.046
We gotta hit the bricks.
This place is about to go boom.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.227
You better keep your word.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.356
Let go of me, or I'll kick you off.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.455
- All right.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.291
All right, put your weight on me.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.671
-  Can you hear me?
-  We're coming.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.631
Hurry. You have five minutes.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.758
Hey, can you see her, Luke?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.926
No, but I can hear her getting closer.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.766
- Oh, Danielle.
- It's okay. He knows my real name.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.268
Might as well tell me yours too, Finn.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.187
I'll find out eventually
once I'm out of here.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.272
When you're out, you are under arrest.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.732
About that, we called a truce.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.693
We'd get out, go our separate ways,
live to fight another day.

12:57.693 --> 13:01.530
Luke, you have your orders.
Polonia does not get out of that vent.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.948
Okay, come.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.581
-  Damn it, I can't reach.
- I'll go. I'm taller.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.500
- No, she goes first.
- You'll leave me here.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.752
I won't leave you. I give you my word.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.712
Luke, you will not defy a direct order.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.380
Lift her up, and then you.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.926
You're running out of time, Bengal.
In a few minutes, you're gonna die.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.052
Three minutes, to be exact.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.601
Come on, Emma.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.105
Got it.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.660
Thank God.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.121
- Your head.
- Yeah, he took a pipe to me.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.499
It's okay. I'm good.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.251
Come on, Finn, get me out of here.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.007
Within minutes,
everything you worked for will go to dust.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.926
And you will never forgive us,

14:03.926 --> 14:05.845
and you will never stop coming after us.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.222
Your new mission will be vengeance.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.349
- You gave me your word! Let me out!
-  I'm sorry.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.310
- I can't let you come after her.
-  You can't do this to me, Finn.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.728
I was like a son to you!

14:22.820 --> 14:24.321
You were like a son,

14:25.656 --> 14:27.199
but she <i>is</i> my daughter.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.036
- Goodbye, Bengal.
- No!

14:31.036 --> 14:33.414
Sir, the temperature's reached
critical mass.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.957
Luke, you gotta run.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.128
You can't do this to me, Finn! Finn!

14:48.804 --> 14:50.264
Hail Mary,

14:52.141 --> 14:53.392
full of grace,

14:54.977 --> 14:56.312
the Lord is with thee.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.274
Blessed art thou amongst women...

15:18.876 --> 15:21.879
<i>Director, nuke detonated but contained.</i>

15:21.879 --> 15:23.422
Target neutralized.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.926
<i>All CIA personnel alive and accounted for.</i>

15:26.926 --> 15:29.428
Mission complete.
That's it, and that's all.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.555
- Hell yeah!
- Woo!

15:31.555 --> 15:34.600
You just took out a major terrorist. Congratulations.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.852
We all did. It was a group effort.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.562
Good work, doc.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.782
Got the helicopter coordinates from Roo.
Twelve minutes out.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.200
That's good.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.576
How's your head?

15:52.576 --> 15:53.911
Uh, getting better.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.539
How's yours?
Couldn't have been easy back there.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.083
Uh, it was not.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.001
Dad, I, um...

16:03.754 --> 16:07.633
I've been blaming you for a lot of things
that... weren't your fault

16:07.633 --> 16:09.218
for a while now.

16:10.010 --> 16:14.473
I guess I was refusing to accept
my share of the blame.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.642
That couldn't have felt good.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.561
It wasn't fair. I'm sorry.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.064
I'm sorry too.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.608
Because a lot of it was my fault.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.736
No, I'm serious. I mean, I shouldn't
put my nose into your affairs.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.239
I mean, I shouldn't interfere. It's wrong.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.616
What do they call that? Chopper parent?

16:33.575 --> 16:34.410
Helicopter.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.580
Well, when it comes to worrying about you,

16:38.580 --> 16:41.166
I'm like an Apache helicopter.
I'll tell you that.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.002
But you know,

16:43.002 --> 16:45.504
I do all these things
because I love you so much.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.089
It's...

16:47.715 --> 16:49.591
I know this is not a good excuse.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.179
There's one more thing
that I have to own up to.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.559
"That's it, and that's all?"

16:59.810 --> 17:00.644
Yeah?

17:00.644 --> 17:03.397
I stole it
from <i>Throw Momma from the Train</i>.

17:04.982 --> 17:05.858
I knew it.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.401
I love Danny DeVito.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.902
He's so tiny.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.904
I want to put him in my pocket.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.870
Um, Barry.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.332
I just got word from the NSA
that my transfer's being quashed.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.292
I'm staying.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.335
-  That's incredible.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.714
Wanna tell me how this happened?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.050
Who knows, you know?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.801
Government bureaucracy, you know?

17:33.594 --> 17:34.428
Mm.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.138
I know.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.349
I've seen you running around,
making calls.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.977
What did you do for me, Barry Putt?

17:41.977 --> 17:43.479
It just cost me a comic book.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.647
<i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> #298.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.400
The first one penciled by Todd McFarlane.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.693
"Don't Worry Be Happy."

17:49.693 --> 17:50.986
That's Bobby McFerrin.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.488
Okay.

17:52.488 --> 17:56.408
Todd McFarlane's work
had an understated beauty about it.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.787
And... as soon as I saw it...

18:01.955 --> 18:03.123
...I knew it was special.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.802
HQ just texted back.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.305
The ambulance is ready on the runway,
and the surgeon is on standby.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.557
I don't need an ambulance. You take me.

18:20.557 --> 18:24.269
Don't argue with Dr. Roo.
She says take the ambulance, take it.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.481
- Don't tell us what to do, princess.
- I'm agreeing with you.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.442
- Still, I am holding a jar of pee...

18:31.151 --> 18:32.611
...so don't piss me off.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.322
- You can't fake it anymore, you know.
- Fake what?

18:35.322 --> 18:36.365
That you hate me.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.910
Stoned or not, you said
some nice things to me. Real nice.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.663
- And we both know what that means.
- I'm gonna punch you in the cooter?

18:42.663 --> 18:46.416
No, that deep down part of you likes me,
and that means we're friends.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.671
Fine. But it's not like
we're gonna do each other's hair

18:50.671 --> 18:52.798
and make BFF TikToks together.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.424
- Got it?
- Got it.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.717
That being said,

18:56.844 --> 18:58.887
I am glad you didn't get blown up today.

19:00.013 --> 19:00.848
I'll take it.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.066
He was right, you know.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.071
Years ago,
I looked at him not like my son,

19:16.071 --> 19:18.240
but like a child I really cared for,

19:18.240 --> 19:21.368
and I just can't get over the feeling

19:21.368 --> 19:23.704
that maybe I should have done
more to stop him

19:24.204 --> 19:26.039
from going down that road that he took.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.749
Dad, Boro's a grown man.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.751
Everything that went down in his life,

19:30.878 --> 19:31.920
it's on him.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.256
You're right.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.718
He had to go.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.724
So chatter's been minimal,

19:43.724 --> 19:45.434
little bits here and there.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.602
Tina's been monitoring,

19:46.602 --> 19:49.104
but everything points
to the same conclusion.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.982
Lape Pa Lanmo has run for the hills.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.611
Totally disjointed, broken as a threat,
completely nullified.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.237
Well, that's great news, Director.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.740
I've reviewed
the after-action report, however,

19:59.740 --> 20:03.660
and there was one thing
I just can't quite figure out.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.578
Ma'am?

20:04.578 --> 20:07.080
You were in some
pretty dire straits in Sardovia.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.791
Trapped underground
in a radioactive hellhole,

20:09.791 --> 20:11.668
stuck with a sociopathic killer,

20:11.668 --> 20:15.172
surrounded by material
perfectly suited for makeshift weapons.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.758
Survival instincts easily
could've taken over,

20:17.758 --> 20:20.177
the whole situation
devolves into a bloodbath,

20:20.177 --> 20:23.722
and your hard-headed father
would've kept looking for you,

20:23.722 --> 20:25.224
likely died in the blast along with you.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.143
But somewhere along the line,

20:28.143 --> 20:31.313
you and Boro, against all odds,

20:31.939 --> 20:34.274
wound up working together
to try to escape.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.068
So I gotta ask,

20:37.027 --> 20:38.528
how the hell did that happen?

20:39.696 --> 20:41.323
I guess I convinced him to cooperate.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.743
Okay, and how the hell did you do that?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.536
I reasoned with him.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.288
Ah, I see.

20:48.288 --> 20:51.833
Funny, doesn't sound like
that impulsive rogue officer

20:51.833 --> 20:54.378
we had to rescue from Guyana
not so long ago.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.088
The hope is that this new mindset

20:56.088 --> 20:58.215
will help you
with your new PCS assignment.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.508
New assignment?

20:59.508 --> 21:03.470
Well, according to the progress reports
I received from your superior officer,

21:04.096 --> 21:06.431
he thinks you'll do just fine
on your own again.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.475
- So do I.
- Dad.

21:08.475 --> 21:12.229
Look, I would rather have you be
a librarian or something, but uh...

21:14.314 --> 21:15.899
if you want to continue this work,

21:15.899 --> 21:17.192
to tell you the truth,

21:18.443 --> 21:19.820
you don't need me anymore.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.447
- Yes, I do.
- No.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.076
Director, I'm... I'm flattered,
but the truth is,

21:26.076 --> 21:27.619
I never thought I'd say this,

21:28.829 --> 21:31.206
I've learned a ton
from working with my dad.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.333
How he leads the team,

21:33.333 --> 21:34.835
how he keeps his cool,

21:34.835 --> 21:37.713
how to slit a man's throat vertically
so he bleeds out faster.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.842
I'd like to stay on his team.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.552
You can't, sweetheart.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.262
I'm retiring.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.514
The papers have been resubmitted.

21:50.684 --> 21:51.810
It's your mom.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.437
Excuse me.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.567
Tally. So nice to hear your voice.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.902
Yeah, that's right.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.529
Mm-hm.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.199
You did what?!

22:10.746 --> 22:12.622
There. No more blemish.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.124
A pimple on my wedding day.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.168
Must be nerves.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.338
You look amazing, Grandma. Right?

22:20.255 --> 22:22.090
Uh-huh. Very pretty.

22:22.090 --> 22:26.178
- Aw, cutie-pie. You look like a princess.
- Thank you.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.888
It's true, Mom. You look beautiful.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.557
Knock, knock.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.976
Hey, no seeing the bride
before the wedding.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.854
But I've seen the bride
a million times before the wedding.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.939
Oh, but never like this.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.441
Tally, you look stunning.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.942
Well, I have a pimple.

22:41.943 --> 22:46.990
I have a prediction that today
is going to be the best day of my life.

22:47.574 --> 22:50.911
Okay, I'm here to just tell you gals
the fellas are heading down to the church,

22:50.911 --> 22:52.579
so we'll see you in a few.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.830
Don't be late

22:53.830 --> 22:55.749
'cause we'll be there with bells on.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.667
Like the steeple.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.965
- All righty.
- Okay, yeah. See you there.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.970
- Mom, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

23:09.638 --> 23:10.597
Absolutely.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.192
Hey. Got the shoe polish.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.694
Midnight, not to be confused
with supervillain Midnight,

23:24.694 --> 23:26.988
archenemy of Marvel superhero, Moon.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.366
Fantastic. Thank you very much.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.868
Guys, you're not gonna believe it.
I can't believe it.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.287
I've been dealing
with this national dry-cleaning chain.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.998
They think the tech in my app
can help them track inventory.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.209
They wanna buy my company for 4.8 million.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.836
Dollars? For MaizeLee?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.421
MyAisles. Yeah. It's a--

23:42.421 --> 23:44.631
Everyone's gonna get
eight times their investment.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.968
Hold on, wait, so I just made 70 grand?

23:47.968 --> 23:53.265
70,432.18, to be exact.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.391
- That's amazing!

23:54.391 --> 23:56.435
- Congratulations!
- You're a millionaire!

23:57.811 --> 23:59.938
You know, your uncle has had his eye

23:59.938 --> 24:02.232
on the original Mogwai cage from <i>Gremlins</i>.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.528
Let's just sit on all this amazing news
until tomorrow, right?

24:06.528 --> 24:09.489
I mean, um, today is Mom's big day.
I don't wanna take away from it.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.532
- Yeah.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.536
No, we wouldn't wanna do that, would we?

24:15.203 --> 24:16.163
Hello, everybody.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.956
- Hey, Luke.
-  Hey.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.583
- I come in peace.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.586
Okay, so I just wanted
to wish you all a wonderful day,

24:23.086 --> 24:25.964
and I brought some flowers for the bride.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.633
Luke, that's very kind of you. Thank you.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.844
- And congratulations, Donnie.
- Thanks.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.387
I have to tell you from experience,

24:32.387 --> 24:35.098
these will be the happiest days
of your life, being married to Tally.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.726
- Yeah.
- I'm very happy that she found a good guy.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.644
Oh, well, I appreciate that, Luke.

24:39.644 --> 24:43.190
And hey, we were both disappointed
to get your "will not attend" card.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.484
It's a small ceremony.
There's plenty of room,

24:45.484 --> 24:46.818
even for a big fella like you.

24:46.818 --> 24:50.071
I appreciate that,
but this day is all about you two.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.240
Okay, well, in case you change your mind,

24:52.240 --> 24:54.701
the reception's at Luigi's.
We'd love to have you.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.495
- But we gotta hit it.
- Thank you.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.913
- Thanks, Luke.
- Sure.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.748
Class act, Dad. Proud of you.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.416
Thank you.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.334
See ya.

25:04.669 --> 25:05.879
I'm proud too.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.756
You're keeping it together pretty good.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.592
I'm dead inside.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.093
That's what I figured.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.306
I'm really sorry, pal.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.156
Luke.

25:38.578 --> 25:39.412
You okay?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.248
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.586
You are beautiful.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.258
It's like a magic trick
that stuns me every time.

25:51.258 --> 25:54.094
Well, aren't you the sweet one.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.887
Oh, I brought you flowers.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.473
-  Daisies.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.476
- My favorite.
-  Mm-hm.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.103
Supermarket's finest.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.108
Look, I just wanted to come by

26:08.108 --> 26:12.028
and say something
that I probably said a million times.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.490
I'm so sorry, what I've put you through.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.993
I mean, from the time we met,

26:17.993 --> 26:21.663
all I always wanted
was just for you to be happy,

26:22.998 --> 26:25.000
and I'm glad that
that day has come for you.

26:26.459 --> 26:27.419
Thank you, Luke.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.802
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

26:35.802 --> 26:39.598
Just gonna kick back,
have some beer with Napoleon,

26:39.598 --> 26:43.560
Thomas Dewey, Buffalo Bills,
and all the great losers in history.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.735
Thank you for being you.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.000
- I guess that's it, and that's all.
- You think?

27:08.251 --> 27:10.837
- How could you hurt her like this again?
- Hurt her?

27:10.837 --> 27:12.380
I'm trying to be the bigger man.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.965
You're being the dumber man.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.636
She was drunk and pissed at you
when she proposed.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.847
She may love him,
but she's not in love with him.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.225
Look, you just don't understand.

27:24.225 --> 27:26.269
I understand that I saw my mom
force a smile

27:26.269 --> 27:28.938
at one of Donnie's stupid jokes

27:28.938 --> 27:33.443
two minutes before you made her light up
on the saddest day of her life.

27:35.445 --> 27:39.366
She's still in love with your...
clueless Austrian ass.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.662
No one makes her laugh like you do
or feel joy like you do you.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.288
And give her pain like I do.

27:45.288 --> 27:47.999
You only hurt her because the job,
and the job is over.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.794
So Donnie should be over.
They're not meant to be together.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.504
I never should have set them up.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.214
Okay? I'm sorry.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.883
I fucked up.

27:57.467 --> 27:58.677
Language.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.598
You're gonna let it happen, aren't you?

28:13.775 --> 28:14.693
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.532
You're gonna wake up tomorrow
and realize you blew it.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.121
Love you.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.221
Shit.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.312
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.650
Oh, nice. Yeah, I was hoping
I'd get to see you play today.

28:55.650 --> 28:56.568
Yeah.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.988
I haven't played in front of a crowd
in a while, but my mom asked me to, so...

28:59.988 --> 29:01.740
Well, I think you're...
you're gonna kill it.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.908
I hope it sounds good.
It's no Raffaele Carmalini.

29:03.908 --> 29:08.121
Yeah. Thank you for giving me
the other violin back.

29:08.121 --> 29:12.917
Um, I was actually able to sell it
and make a small profit.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.043
- Wow.
- Yeah.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.546
Yeah, I mean,
it wouldn't have been right to keep it.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.464
- So yeah.
- Yeah.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.509
It's kinda weird,

29:21.509 --> 29:24.095
this being the church
we were gonna get married in.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.889
Weird is the word. Um...

29:26.681 --> 29:28.933
So are you seeing anybody?

29:28.933 --> 29:32.228
- No, no. Just me, myself, and I.
- Yeah.

29:34.939 --> 29:38.109
Uh, what about you?
Are you still dating the lawn-dart woman?

29:38.109 --> 29:40.445
Bernadette, and it was, uh, cricket.

29:40.445 --> 29:44.240
And uh... yeah, no, we broke up.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.868
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.412
It's fine, you know.
People... People break up.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.998
- Yeah, they-- They do.
- Yeah.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.503
I should probably...

29:58.505 --> 30:01.299
- It was good seeing you.
- Yeah. Good to... Good to see you too, Em.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.888
<i>There's still something brewing here.</i>

30:07.472 --> 30:10.058
I thought I could get away,
but there's been an uptick in chatter

30:10.058 --> 30:11.976
<i>from the scattered Lape Pa Lan-bros.</i>

30:11.976 --> 30:13.645
Really? What kind of chatter?

30:13.645 --> 30:15.313
<i>Still breaking the encryption.</i>

30:15.313 --> 30:17.023
Probably some low-level soldiers

30:17.023 --> 30:19.984
that are trying to locate
some of Boro's unseized assets.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.986
<i>Dot is having me catalog it.</i>

30:21.986 --> 30:24.989
- Soon as I'm done, I'll get to the church.
<i>-</i> <i>Okay.</i>

30:24.989 --> 30:27.867
But hustle your bustle
'cause the wedding is about to start.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.370
You know you become Batman
if you skip church, right?

30:31.246 --> 30:33.957
- Huh?
- You'd be Christian Bale. Get it?

30:34.457 --> 30:36.251
A Christian who bailed on church?

30:36.251 --> 30:39.796
Yeah, I'm Hindu, and that joke
makes me think there's no gods.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.506
See you soon.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.054
That ain't good.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.767
I don't know about this.
I don't wanna get locked up again.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.771
Shawn, we did five weeks in county
for lizard smuggling.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.731
This SOB and his secretary set us up.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.817
- But, Travis, it's not worth it--
- Bullshit.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.487
Okay, we put the recorder under the seat.

31:04.487 --> 31:07.866
We catch him slipping up, and we got him.
Now pick the goddamn lock.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.201
I got your back.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.293
Luke.

31:19.752 --> 31:23.131
- What are you doing here?
- Fixing a mistake that I made decades ago.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.009
I'm in love with you, Talulah,

31:26.009 --> 31:29.929
but I've been lying to you for years,
and I just want you to hear the truth.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.390
And then after that,

31:32.390 --> 31:35.101
if you still decide to marry Donnie,
so be it.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.644
I'll just step aside.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.480
You have some balls.

31:40.064 --> 31:44.402
You show up minutes before my wedding
with a horseshit grand gesture

31:44.402 --> 31:47.071
to finally tell me the truth?

31:47.071 --> 31:48.656
Let me save you the trouble, Luke.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.867
There is nothing you can say

31:50.867 --> 31:55.330
that could possibly make me change my mind
or believe what you-- Or, or...

31:55.330 --> 31:58.917
I've been a spy for the CIA
since before we met.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.253
I was never a gym equipment salesman.
That was all bullshit.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.632
I was never around because I was always
on international missions

32:05.632 --> 32:07.842
to wipe out criminals and killers.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.594
I kept it a secret from you

32:09.594 --> 32:11.721
because I wanted
to protect you and the family.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.391
But now that's it.
I'm done with it forever.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.977
Here, I'll show you.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.649
This is the National Distinguished
Service Award medal.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.194
Now you don't get this from Cracker Jack.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.821
So please,

32:29.405 --> 32:30.949
don't marry Donnie.

32:33.826 --> 32:34.661
Uh.

33:03.022 --> 33:03.898
Shit.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.737
<i>♪ Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na ♪</i>

33:09.737 --> 33:11.114
<i>♪ Barry! ♪</i>

33:11.114 --> 33:13.282

33:13.282 --> 33:14.575
<i>♪ Voicemail! ♪</i>

33:26.879 --> 33:29.007
Wait, wait! I got an idea.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.342
Uh-huh.

33:40.643 --> 33:43.730
Now, I know this is a lot for you
to take in and to believe,

33:43.730 --> 33:45.064
but here, let me show you.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.026
This is security footage
from a raid in Mozambique

33:48.026 --> 33:49.861
when I missed the baptism for your niece.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.195
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.905
Well, I want to warn you,

33:52.905 --> 33:55.324
this is very bloody and very gory.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.368
I mean, I killed a lot of people.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.286
- What?
- Yeah.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.537
But they all were dicks.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.289
What?

34:01.289 --> 34:05.168
So believe me, I've been in love with you
every single day.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.837
- And I promise you--

34:07.837 --> 34:09.213
- Down!

34:11.549 --> 34:12.508
Car bomb.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.515
Stay down. I'll get the kids.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.727
Hey, everybody just remain calm.

34:25.354 --> 34:27.815
I'm gonna get your dad.
He's in the back with your mom.

34:27.815 --> 34:28.941
What?

34:28.941 --> 34:31.903
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Emma, why do you have a gun?

34:36.157 --> 34:37.992
Get down! Get down!

35:45.810 --> 35:48.312
So go ahead, express your truths.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.064
Okay.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.569
I shouldn't have retired.
I shouldn't have abandoned my friends.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.364
And I was wrong about you, Aldon.
You'd be a wonderful son-in-law.

35:58.364 --> 35:59.907
I want you to marry Emma

35:59.907 --> 36:02.952
and impregnate her with my grandbabies.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.746
Good. It's a good start.
Roo, let's see what you got.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.916
Yeah, I have actually
never kissed a girl before,

36:08.916 --> 36:11.043
but I think you would be
a very patient teacher--

36:11.043 --> 36:13.087
Guys! You gotta get to the church!

36:27.018 --> 36:28.060
I can't talk now.

36:28.728 --> 36:29.937
No, I'm sorry.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.982
I can't right now.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.693
I'll call you later.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.945
I'm in the middle of something.

37:01.969 --> 37:04.597
Everything is under control.
It's safe.

37:30.790 --> 37:31.707
Mom.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.086
Boro?

37:35.670 --> 37:37.088
You remember this harmonica?

37:37.088 --> 37:40.132
You gave it to me
back when you still loved me.

37:40.132 --> 37:42.176
How the hell did you find us?

37:42.176 --> 37:44.095
The twine ring on your daughter's finger?

37:44.679 --> 37:46.973
I cross-referenced the name Emma

37:47.473 --> 37:49.267
with engagement announcements.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.853
A kid cranked up on Red Bull
found one in the <i>Westchester Gazette</i>.

37:55.147 --> 37:57.358
- But not for Emma's engagement...

37:59.026 --> 38:00.278
...for her mother's.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.072
Emma Brunner was listed as a bridesmaid.

38:03.572 --> 38:06.242
After I knew the name,
it was easy to find her father.

38:08.077 --> 38:10.246
- Luke Brunner.

38:10.913 --> 38:12.290
Gym equipment salesman.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.542
Totally worth being buried alive

38:14.542 --> 38:16.669
for the two days
it took my men to dig me out.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.422
Even worth the radiation poisoning.

38:19.922 --> 38:23.718
I survived on rat blood and hate.

38:24.593 --> 38:25.678
It's okay, Tally.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.555
It's not you who he wants.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.806
He wants me.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.474
That's not entirely true.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.853
My original plan
was to blow her up after the wedding

38:34.729 --> 38:38.316
and pick off the rest of your family
as they ran to her car to help.

38:40.693 --> 38:43.279
But you're fond of ruining my plans.
You both are.

38:43.279 --> 38:47.199
I was the one that betrayed you,
so let her go and kill me.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.118
Let's get it over with.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.703
What do you say, Bengal?

38:51.787 --> 38:53.789
Don't call me that!

38:53.789 --> 38:55.624
Don't pretend to care!

38:57.793 --> 38:59.253
Look at what you made me.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.047
You want it to be over?

39:01.047 --> 39:02.423
There's only one way.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.633
Only way that's fair.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.596
The two of you, the two liars!

39:09.263 --> 39:10.348
Face each other.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.976
Take your guns and point them
at each other's heads...

39:15.853 --> 39:17.938
...then father and daughter
pull the trigger together.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.940
No, don't do that! Don't!

39:19.940 --> 39:22.234
Do that, and she lives.

39:23.861 --> 39:27.615
If you don't, she dies right now.

39:27.615 --> 39:28.824
Mom, it's our fault.

39:28.824 --> 39:29.825
Oh, baby.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.335
No. No, no, no,

39:39.335 --> 39:41.045
I love you, sweetheart.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.297
I love you, Dad.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.300
Don't!

39:46.300 --> 39:49.595
Tally, you're the love of my life.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.931
Everything that you've
gone through with me,

39:53.391 --> 39:54.725
you deserve a medal.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.062
You hear me, Tally?

39:58.687 --> 39:59.563
A medal.

40:35.057 --> 40:35.891
Got him.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.440
It's headquarters. Hello?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.774
<i>You've all been burned.</i>

40:43.774 --> 40:45.776
Your identities have been compromised.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.737
A transpo officer will have a van to you
in less than 20 seconds.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.576
Everyone in the van, now!

40:54.743 --> 40:56.829
- We gotta get Tina!
- Barry, we got burned.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.249
Tina doesn't want you to die.
Get your ass into the van.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.671
- Come on, let's go.
- We're in. We're in.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.888
So you're all CIA?

41:13.888 --> 41:15.973
No, just me.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.057
And Luke.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.019
And Emma.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.480
- And me.
- And Roo makes five, Mrs. B.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.772
Break it down, boss.

41:23.772 --> 41:24.815
How bad is it?

41:25.524 --> 41:27.651
Boro was an international terrorist

41:27.651 --> 41:29.695
with a personal vendetta
against Emma and me.

41:29.695 --> 41:32.531
He's known our true identities
for who knows how long.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.908
He could've sold our information

41:33.908 --> 41:36.702
to countless animals
we've gone up against over the years.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.162
I just want to go home.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.039
- You can't.
- What?

41:40.039 --> 41:43.626
Our houses, our bank accounts,
all of our assets,

41:44.335 --> 41:46.128
we can't even get close to it.

41:46.128 --> 41:47.755
There's probably hundreds of terrorists...

41:47.755 --> 41:49.882
- Human traffickers.
- Drug smugglers.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.133
Straight up killers.

41:51.133 --> 41:53.552
...all over the world tracking us,

41:53.552 --> 41:54.803
lying in wait.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.598
We got completely burned.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.391
Nowhere is safe.

42:00.559 --> 42:01.894
So, what do we do now?

42:03.187 --> 42:04.230
I don't know.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.776
It's totally FUBAR.
