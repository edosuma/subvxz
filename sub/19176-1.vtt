I don't wanna

01:33.260 --> 01:34.260
It's gone by
too fast.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.530
Maybe I don't.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.360
Maybe I stay here and paint.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.670
No, no, no,
we have a plan, remember?

01:40.700 --> 01:42.970
It just feels like goodbye.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.240
No, no goodbyes.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.570
Look, it'll just be
a few months.

01:47.610 --> 01:48.670
You have to finish school.

01:48.710 --> 01:50.140
I have to finish work.

01:51.610 --> 01:53.250
Have you told your father
you're quitting?

01:54.450 --> 01:55.450
I will.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.190
Hey, we'll be back together
by Valentine's day.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.860
Top of
the empire state building?

02:06.890 --> 02:08.036
Doesn't sound
quite as romantic

02:08.060 --> 02:10.199
as the top of
the Eiffel Tower,

02:10.229 --> 02:11.460
but it will have to do.

02:16.940 --> 02:18.070
We'll lock it
on the bridge,

02:18.100 --> 02:20.410
and our love
will last forever.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.610
Forever?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.040
Forever.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.250
Forever...

02:31.480 --> 02:33.750
Okay.

02:33.790 --> 02:35.220
With this lock, I thee...

02:36.320 --> 02:37.320
Whoa!

02:48.800 --> 02:50.270
You did that on purpose.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.240
No, no, no,
that was your fault.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.570
You-you grabbed for it.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.880
Thank you.

03:13.590 --> 03:15.290
Good morning, Maggie.

03:15.330 --> 03:16.130
Morning, Lindsey.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.060
First cup of coffee?

03:17.100 --> 03:17.960
Third.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.346
How are we doing
with the Valentine issue?

03:19.370 --> 03:20.730
You just need
to pick a cover.

03:20.770 --> 03:22.170
Not the cupid.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.770
The last thing
i want to think about

03:23.800 --> 03:24.976
is a chubby toddler
coming at me with a weapon.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.310
Hmm, such a romantic.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.470
Not that one.

03:28.510 --> 03:29.510
Speaking of which,

03:29.540 --> 03:30.740
Trent greer's
in your office.

03:30.780 --> 03:31.710
What?

03:31.740 --> 03:33.810
Sorry, he's a really
hard guy to say no to.

03:33.850 --> 03:34.810
What's he doing here?

03:34.850 --> 03:36.250
Who cares?
He's gorgeous.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.496
Now, do something
with your hair.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.350
What's wrong
with my hair?

03:38.380 --> 03:40.420
You could try wearing it
down sometimes.

03:40.450 --> 03:41.966
Don't you have
something to do?

03:50.000 --> 03:50.800
Trent...

03:50.830 --> 03:51.800
Hey...

03:51.830 --> 03:53.100
What a surprise.

03:53.130 --> 03:54.470
Oh, yeah? Good or bad?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.500
Good. Good...

03:56.540 --> 03:58.800
Good. Good...

03:58.840 --> 04:00.346
Um, actually, I wanted
to catch you before you left,

04:00.370 --> 04:01.940
because your assistant said

04:01.970 --> 04:03.186
that you're going
to Paris tomorrow

04:03.210 --> 04:04.010
with your daughter.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.110
Oh, did she tell you

04:05.140 --> 04:06.156
what I had
for breakfast as well?

04:06.180 --> 04:07.180
French toast?

04:11.150 --> 04:13.020
God, I can't believe
you're old enough

04:13.050 --> 04:14.290
to have a daughter old enough

04:14.320 --> 04:16.350
to be in college.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.360
I am also old enough to know
when I'm being buttered up.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.200
All right.

04:23.230 --> 04:26.000
Okay, here it is.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.330
I really want to take you out.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.270
Oh.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.370
Yeah, and I want
to buy your magazine.

04:33.610 --> 04:34.970
Oh.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.380
Okay, now, was that
a "yes/yes,"

04:39.410 --> 04:41.050
a "yes/no," or a "no/yes"?

04:43.180 --> 04:44.850
Yes.

04:44.880 --> 04:45.850
And no.

04:45.890 --> 04:47.150
I-i don't know...

04:47.190 --> 04:50.360
Let me tell you
this, Lindsey,

04:50.390 --> 04:52.890
you've done
an incredible job with <i>pov.</i>

04:52.930 --> 04:54.760
It is-it is a unique magazine,

04:54.790 --> 04:56.760
you've done it yourself,
on a limited budget...

04:56.800 --> 04:57.760
Thank you?

04:57.800 --> 04:58.660
The problem is,
the readership's maxed out,

04:58.700 --> 04:59.660
and it does not
have to be like that,

04:59.700 --> 05:02.230
and I can help you
take it to the next level.

05:02.270 --> 05:03.940
You want to buy me out.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.116
I want you to stay on
to consult.

05:05.140 --> 05:06.370
So I'd be working for you.

05:06.410 --> 05:07.610
With me.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.540
You know, Trent,
the thing is,

05:09.580 --> 05:11.910
I've kind of become
used to being my own boss.

05:11.940 --> 05:12.910
I do get that.

05:12.950 --> 05:13.850
Believe me.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.780
When I opened my first
publishing house,

05:15.820 --> 05:17.450
the last thing on my mind
was selling it,

05:17.480 --> 05:19.450
but I did.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.890
I did, and I built something
bigger and better

05:21.920 --> 05:22.920
than I ever imagined.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.220
So, do me a favor.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.960
While you're traveling,

05:26.990 --> 05:28.060
just think about it.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.860
And the other "it," too.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.270
I will.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.630
And I will.

05:35.670 --> 05:36.840
Great.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.910
And, one other thing,

05:42.940 --> 05:45.280
um, I'm actually going
to be in London next week,

05:45.310 --> 05:46.386
and it's a short flight
to Paris.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.750
I'd love the chance
to show you our Paris office.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.020
Wow, you must really want
my magazine.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.180
Oh, yeah, that too.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.130
Tell me he's not
the best-looking guy

06:06.170 --> 06:07.400
you've ever seen.

06:07.430 --> 06:09.570
Looks have
nothing to do with it.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.300
What's wrong?

06:11.340 --> 06:13.140
He wants to buy
the magazine.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.570
Seriously?

06:14.610 --> 06:16.170
What did you say?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.910
I wanted to say "no,"
but somehow I didn't?

06:18.940 --> 06:20.750
Hmm, I'm pretty sure
he has that effect

06:20.780 --> 06:22.080
on everyone.

06:22.110 --> 06:23.680
Would it be
so bad to sell?

06:23.720 --> 06:24.680
I'm saying goodbye
to my daughter,

06:24.720 --> 06:26.650
I don't want to say goodbye
to my business, too.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.920
I know, it's just...

06:28.950 --> 06:30.290
He's just so gorgeous.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.796
Maggie, that's
all you can think about.

06:31.820 --> 06:32.960
Let's finish up
this layout.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.190
That's great.

06:34.230 --> 06:35.990
Really great.

06:36.030 --> 06:37.100
You packed yet?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.030
Tonight.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.260
Throw in something sexy.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.500
Why?

06:40.530 --> 06:41.470
You're going
to Paris, girl,

06:41.500 --> 06:42.670
not New Jersey.

06:42.700 --> 06:43.840
All right.

06:43.870 --> 06:44.740
This looks good,

06:44.770 --> 06:45.986
except move the gaucher
to the center,

06:46.010 --> 06:47.370
and increase it to 5x7.

06:47.410 --> 06:49.140
Oh, and also,
increase the opacity

06:49.180 --> 06:50.410
so we're seeing the titles.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.240
Yeah, like that.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.310
Hi, mom!

07:25.340 --> 07:27.650
'Lex? You're early!

07:27.680 --> 07:29.750
Yeah, I caught a ride
with a guy from school!

07:29.780 --> 07:31.050
What guy?

07:31.080 --> 07:34.050
Uh, some guy who's name I found
on the ride board in my dorm.

07:34.090 --> 07:35.396
You drove
all the way from Connecticut

07:35.420 --> 07:36.390
with a total stranger?

07:36.420 --> 07:38.220
And two other friends.

07:38.260 --> 07:39.866
So the three of you drove
from Connecticut

07:39.890 --> 07:41.160
with a total
stranger.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.890
Mom, you are
helicoptering again.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.700
You're right.

07:45.730 --> 07:47.070
Engine's off.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.040
Hey! I remember that.

07:53.070 --> 07:55.340
It used to be in the hallway.

07:55.370 --> 07:56.670
Yeah, we have better taste now.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.440
No, we don't.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.710
You should put it up again.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.680
It's too big.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.110
You were so good.
Why did you stop?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.880
Hmm, I guess
my fine arts degree

08:04.920 --> 08:07.020
taught me the fine art
of unemployment.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.890
Maybe you'll start again.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.296
No, it's your turn, kiddo.
You hungry?

08:11.320 --> 08:13.890
Pasta?
Alfredo sauce?

08:13.930 --> 08:14.930
Extra cheese!

08:16.400 --> 08:18.960
I can't wait for you
to meet Hugo.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.030
Me either.

08:20.070 --> 08:21.470
He is the best teacher.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.030
But he's a little bit
of a meddler,

08:23.070 --> 08:24.446
so don't tell him too much
about your social life.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.240
Not that you'll have one,

08:25.270 --> 08:27.570
because you'll be
too busy studying.

08:27.610 --> 08:29.470
Uh-huh, right...

08:29.510 --> 08:30.910
Ten letter word
for "soulmate"?

08:31.910 --> 08:32.880
"Delusional?"

08:32.909 --> 08:34.710
You're terrible.

08:34.750 --> 08:35.750
Or realistic.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.280
Why should there be
only one person for everyone?

08:38.320 --> 08:40.120
But what if
there is?

08:40.150 --> 08:41.265
Honey, remember
when I had to tell you

08:41.289 --> 08:42.750
there was no tooth fairy?

08:42.789 --> 08:44.760
Well, brace yourself.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.736
Okay, just because you were
right about the tooth fairy

08:46.760 --> 08:48.630
doesn't mean
you're right about this.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.260
It's dad.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.730
See? Proof positive.

08:55.270 --> 08:57.140
Hi, dad.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.140
Yes, I'll be careful.

08:59.170 --> 09:01.140
Yes, I have my passport.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.480
Okay, um... say hi to Jane.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.980
Okay, love you, too.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.580
Yeah, bye.

09:08.450 --> 09:09.580
Who's Jane?

09:09.620 --> 09:10.950
Um...

09:10.980 --> 09:11.980
Dad and Marcie separated,

09:12.020 --> 09:14.850
so it looks like he's heading
for number three.

09:14.890 --> 09:16.620
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

09:16.660 --> 09:17.520
And you shouldn't refer
to your dad's wives

09:17.560 --> 09:18.920
as numbers.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.790
At least you're
still number one.

09:19.830 --> 09:20.990
Yay.

09:21.030 --> 09:22.790
You know what
i look forward to?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.760
The day that I get to tell dad

09:24.800 --> 09:27.100
that you are seeing
someone else.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.670
I'm more concerned with work,
you know that.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.100
Yes, that's what
you always say.

09:31.140 --> 09:32.300
Actually,

09:32.340 --> 09:34.140
someone wants to buy <i>pov.</i>

09:34.170 --> 09:36.810
Actually, not just someone.

09:36.840 --> 09:37.980
Trent greer.

09:38.010 --> 09:38.980
The publishing guy?

09:39.010 --> 09:40.010
Yeah.

09:40.050 --> 09:41.110
That's great.

09:41.150 --> 09:43.580
It would be,
if I was selling.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.180
Would that be such a bad thing?

09:47.520 --> 09:48.490
It's what I do every day.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.990
It's... who I am.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.220
Why would I sell my life?

09:52.260 --> 09:54.990
What life?
You work all the time, and...

09:55.030 --> 09:57.560
I mean,
i love the magazine, but...

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
It's kind of
the only relationship you have.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.200
I have you.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.370
Okay...

10:05.400 --> 10:07.040
When's the last time
you went out?

10:07.070 --> 10:08.010
And not for something
business-y.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.340
Not that long ago.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.310
I don't think.

10:12.340 --> 10:15.850
Can you believe
you're about to go to Paris

10:15.880 --> 10:16.750
for three months?

10:16.780 --> 10:18.580
Mm-hmm, nice pivot.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.190
Helicopters pivot, right?

10:21.220 --> 10:23.320
And I can't wait.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.490
Done!

11:02.160 --> 11:03.730
Place de la concorde!

11:05.600 --> 11:07.270
Wait till you see it
with all the lights.

11:11.740 --> 11:12.746
Mom, look, it's
the Eiffel Tower!

11:12.770 --> 11:13.640
We have to go.

11:13.670 --> 11:14.710
We will.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.300
Have you ever
been to the top?

11:17.940 --> 11:19.540
Just once.

11:19.580 --> 11:21.710
I can't believe
you never came back.

11:21.750 --> 11:22.780
Well, I am now.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.000
Bienvenue
a Pierre du calvet.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.140
Thank you.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.670
Wow.

11:47.710 --> 11:49.640
I guess this is us.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.810
It's so us!

11:50.840 --> 11:51.910
It's perfect!

11:51.940 --> 11:53.650
Of course it is,
Hugo picked it.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.980
I like him already.

11:55.010 --> 11:57.220
Welcome to Paris.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.620
Merci.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.290
I mean, really?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.960
Already?
We just landed.

12:19.740 --> 12:20.710
Bonjour.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.610
Bonjour.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.786
Bienvenue a l'hotel
Pierre du calvet.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.880
Merci, quel bel hotel.

12:23.910 --> 12:24.810
Merci.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.940
Nous avons une reservation
au nom de Wilson,

12:26.980 --> 12:28.150
s'il vous plait?

12:28.180 --> 12:29.280
Impressive.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.210
Why is your French
better than mine?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.450
Maybe because you stopped
in the 12th grade?

12:32.480 --> 12:33.380
Not to worry.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.120
Our staff
speaks English.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.220
Yes. Your friend,
monsieur Hugo,

12:37.260 --> 12:39.320
had you upgraded to a suite.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.290
How nice. Thank you.

12:41.330 --> 12:42.390
Unfortunately,

12:42.430 --> 12:43.900
it won't be ready
for a few hours.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.700
Oh, we don't need a room,
we're in Paris!

12:49.840 --> 12:52.140
Pas de probleme.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.510
Hey, where to first?

12:54.540 --> 12:56.170
Arc de triomphe,
place de la concorde...

12:56.210 --> 12:57.340
The louvre?

12:57.380 --> 12:59.316
Or we could save the louvre
for our last day together?

12:59.340 --> 13:01.510
Ah! Can you please
not use the phrase

13:01.550 --> 13:02.910
"last day together"?

13:02.950 --> 13:03.610
You're not allowed
to be sad yet.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.320
We have almost
a week left.

13:05.350 --> 13:08.820
Four days.
96 hours and counting.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.990
Yeah, we can do
a lot in four days.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.830
We should go to
the "love locks" bridge.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.160
It's supposed to be
so romantic.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.260
It's just a bridge.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.700
With locks.

13:18.730 --> 13:19.730
Yeah, but those locks

13:19.770 --> 13:22.230
are people pledging
their love for each other.

13:22.270 --> 13:23.370
Yeah,

13:23.400 --> 13:24.370
and how many
of those people

13:24.400 --> 13:25.570
are still
together today?

13:25.600 --> 13:28.040
All of them,
in some way.

13:28.070 --> 13:30.040
You're
such a romantic.

13:30.080 --> 13:30.910
Yeah, well,

13:30.940 --> 13:31.910
everyone's supposed
to fall in love

13:31.940 --> 13:33.040
in Paris, right?

13:33.080 --> 13:33.880
Yeah.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.850
Until they go back
to their real lives.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.430
C'est ouvert!

13:55.570 --> 13:56.570
Bonjour, Ricardo!

13:56.600 --> 13:57.470
Put the paint anywhere,

13:57.500 --> 13:59.570
just don't make a mess
like the last...

13:59.610 --> 14:00.910
Charming as ever.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.270
- Hugo...
- Lindsey...

14:04.580 --> 14:05.380
Mon coeur.

14:05.410 --> 14:06.780
Alexa!

14:08.650 --> 14:09.750
My new protegee.

14:09.780 --> 14:10.820
Oh, "protegee".

14:10.850 --> 14:12.650
Now I can only
disappoint you.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.580
Oh, well, you'll
only disappoint me

14:13.620 --> 14:15.750
if you stop painting,
like your mother.

14:15.790 --> 14:17.266
I just took a little
time off, that's all.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.160
What, 20 years?

14:18.190 --> 14:19.490
I painted my apartment.

14:19.530 --> 14:21.260
Navajo white, ecru trim.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.790
Oh, ecru, ecru...

14:22.830 --> 14:24.276
You have learned
nothing from me, huh?

14:24.300 --> 14:25.560
It's livable,
and neutral.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.400
Neutral?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.330
Neutral is
the color of the canvas

14:28.370 --> 14:29.770
before you
put on the paint.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.170
I couldn't
agree more.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.140
And thank you for recommending
me to the program.

14:33.170 --> 14:33.910
Oh, well,
i promise you

14:33.940 --> 14:35.570
you will love
the university,

14:35.610 --> 14:36.616
and my class
will be your favorite.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.580
And until you move
into the dorms,

14:39.610 --> 14:42.410
I hope that the hotel
accommodations are good?

14:42.450 --> 14:43.480
We love it.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.450
And thank you
for the upgrade.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.620
Who did you bribe?

14:45.650 --> 14:46.996
Well, I am a friend
of the manager.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.090
Same old Hugo.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.250
You know half of Paris.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.960
Well, how else
shall I sell my work?

14:50.990 --> 14:52.190
Wow.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.830
Is it possible
you've gotten better?

14:53.860 --> 14:55.090
Well, I'm like a fine wine.

14:55.130 --> 14:56.960
This is amazing!

14:57.000 --> 14:58.660
Here, come,
I'll show you.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.630
How about this one?

15:04.700 --> 15:07.140
The love locks bridge.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.040
It's beautiful.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.170
Why isn't it finished?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.610
Well, ask your mother.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.810
This is yours?

15:13.850 --> 15:15.050
I can't believe
you kept it.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.610
Well, this could be
your best work,

15:16.650 --> 15:17.580
if you finished.

15:17.620 --> 15:19.450
Some things are better off
left unfinished.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.126
Well, maybe you'll finish it
while you're here.

15:21.150 --> 15:22.050
Don't count on it.

15:22.090 --> 15:24.520
We'll see.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.020
So, you're staying
for my show?

15:26.060 --> 15:27.120
We wouldn't miss it.

15:34.430 --> 15:35.630
Whoa...

15:38.170 --> 15:40.340
I'm never going to be able
to go to a dorm after this.

15:40.370 --> 15:41.586
I'm never going to be able
to go back to anything

15:41.610 --> 15:42.710
after this.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.380
I think
I'm already in love!

15:54.020 --> 15:55.020
What?

16:15.070 --> 16:16.710
'Lex?

16:22.580 --> 16:24.420
'Lex?

16:26.150 --> 16:28.150
Alexa?

16:54.910 --> 16:57.550
I've always wanted
to visit New York.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.320
I've always wanted
to come here.

16:59.350 --> 17:00.890
How long
you are staying?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.890
For a semester,
at the sorbonne.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
I'm there, too.
Third year.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.060
Oh, what are you studying?

17:06.089 --> 17:07.290
Mathematics.
You?

17:07.329 --> 17:08.390
Art.

17:08.430 --> 17:09.660
I love art.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.000
I love math.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.230
Really?

17:12.260 --> 17:13.970
Uh...

17:14.000 --> 17:17.470
I mean, I could.
I could love math.

17:18.970 --> 17:21.170
I have a day off tomorrow.

17:21.210 --> 17:23.270
Maybe I could
show you around?

17:23.310 --> 17:24.339
Oh, I'd love that,

17:24.380 --> 17:25.810
but I'm going to be with my mom.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.180
She's going through
this whole empty nest thing.

17:28.210 --> 17:29.780
Empty nest?

17:29.820 --> 17:30.920
You mean, um...

17:30.950 --> 17:32.420
Comme un oiseau?

17:32.450 --> 17:34.590
Uh, like a-a bird?

17:34.620 --> 17:39.160
Um, it's more like a...
Like a raptor guarding an egg.

17:40.530 --> 17:42.330
I'm not sure I understand.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.660
Me neither, but...

17:44.700 --> 17:45.760
I love her.

18:01.850 --> 18:03.450
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.280
I seem to have
lost my daughter.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.120
Oh, my.

18:07.150 --> 18:09.150
Well, how old
is the child?

18:09.190 --> 18:10.990
Actually...
18.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.720
Ah, well, not lost then,
just being 18.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.730
That's what I'm afraid of.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.130
I did see a young woman
heading out to the courtyard

18:19.160 --> 18:20.870
with Jean Paul.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.800
Jean Paul?

18:22.830 --> 18:23.830
Bellhop?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.370
Yes, yes,
i think he does

18:25.400 --> 18:26.516
a little of everything
around here.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.740
He's a lovely young man.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.110
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:34.510 --> 18:35.650
Alexa?

18:35.680 --> 18:37.980
Hi, mom!

18:38.020 --> 18:39.350
This is Jean Paul.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.220
Madame,

18:40.250 --> 18:41.920
you need not to worry
about your nest.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.750
My what?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.390
Uh...

18:46.760 --> 18:48.890
Enjoy your evening.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.030
Aw, you
scared him away.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.340
Please, if he scares
that easily,

18:53.370 --> 18:54.900
he's not for you.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.500
And you know that how?

18:56.540 --> 18:58.700
Because, sweetie,
he lives in Paris,

18:58.740 --> 19:00.086
and chances are,
if you start something now,

19:00.110 --> 19:01.670
it'll end
in three months.

19:01.710 --> 19:04.110
End?
It hasn't begun.

19:04.140 --> 19:06.740
I know you think
I'm just your mom,

19:06.780 --> 19:08.410
but I was you once.

19:08.450 --> 19:09.850
And what happens

19:09.880 --> 19:11.226
if you fall in love
with Jean Paul?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.950
- I just met him.
- Exactly.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.050
The semester will be over,
you'll go home,

19:15.090 --> 19:16.450
you'll never see him again,

19:16.490 --> 19:18.420
and Paris
will be ruined for you,

19:18.460 --> 19:20.366
and all this excitement
you're feeling right now,

19:20.390 --> 19:21.330
it'll all
be ruined, too,

19:21.360 --> 19:25.030
because everything will
remind you of him.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.370
Okay, look,

19:28.400 --> 19:29.876
I don't know what's going on
with you right now,

19:29.900 --> 19:31.440
maybe it's
the jet lag.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.740
Um, I'm going to go
get ready for dinner,

19:33.770 --> 19:34.940
and you should
go to the bar,

19:34.970 --> 19:36.640
get yourself
a nice glass of wine,

19:36.680 --> 19:39.240
and remind yourself that...

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
I'm an adult.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.200
Excuse me,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.300
I'll have a glass
of white wine, please?

20:05.340 --> 20:07.170
Uh, yeah, we actually
have a very nice...

20:08.610 --> 20:10.510
Lindsey?

20:10.540 --> 20:12.240
Jack?

20:15.510 --> 20:16.650
What are you doing here?

20:18.050 --> 20:20.250
I'm... pouring you a drink.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.520
You're the bartender?

20:22.550 --> 20:25.990
Actually... I own the place.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.870
Hugo didn't mention
this was your hotel.

20:43.940 --> 20:44.810
Yeah, I guess that's why

20:44.840 --> 20:46.160
he just called me
out of the blue.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.680
I didn't recognize
your last name.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.010
It's my married name.

20:49.050 --> 20:50.210
Oh, congratulations.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.180
We're divorced.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.280
Condolences.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.050
Thank you, and thank you.

20:56.190 --> 20:58.260
So, what are you doing here?

20:58.290 --> 21:00.090
Dropping my daughter off
at school.

21:01.930 --> 21:03.130
You have a daughter.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
Alexa.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.660
She's studying art.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.800
Wow.

21:06.830 --> 21:07.910
Like mother, like daughter.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.170
You have kids?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.540
Oh, no, no, no.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.440
Um, it's just me and the hotel.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.740
It's a nice place.

21:15.770 --> 21:16.910
Yeah. Yeah,
it, uh,

21:16.980 --> 21:18.140
it's been a little while.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.810
Going on 10 years.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.910
You cut your hair.

21:21.950 --> 21:24.220
That's been going on
about 20 years.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.290
You...

21:28.320 --> 21:30.390
You look...

21:30.420 --> 21:31.790
Older?

21:33.460 --> 21:36.460
Uh, I was going to say
beautiful.

21:36.530 --> 21:37.660
Oh.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.530
Thank you.

21:42.270 --> 21:43.600
Oh, my goodness,

21:43.670 --> 21:45.900
you look just like
your mother.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.610
Alexa, this is Jack.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.570
He's, um...

21:51.640 --> 21:52.580
I'm an old friend.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.640
Nice to meet you.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.610
Funny that
you never mentioned him.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.380
I'm sure I did.

21:58.420 --> 21:59.780
No. You didn't.

21:59.820 --> 22:03.290
Well, it was a long,
long time ago.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.760
Well, yeah, but it feels
like it was yesterday.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.320
Well, it's late.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.860
Actually, it's 8:00.

22:08.930 --> 22:09.930
Uh, it's late
in New York.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.336
Well, uh, it's earlier
in New York...

22:11.360 --> 22:12.560
Great seeing you!

22:12.600 --> 22:14.046
All right, well, you'll be
seeing a lot more of me,

22:14.070 --> 22:16.730
since if you want extra towels,
I'm your guy!

22:22.610 --> 22:24.040
We have to move hotels.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.580
Why? I like this hotel.

22:25.610 --> 22:26.810
You'll adjust.

22:26.850 --> 22:28.650
No, I just unpacked.
We're not moving hotels.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.650
So re-pack.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.020
Who is he?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.350
Just...

22:33.390 --> 22:35.120
Someone I used to know
from the sorbonne.

22:35.150 --> 22:36.226
He was finishing up
his degree,

22:36.250 --> 22:38.220
his father was
in the hotel business here.

22:38.260 --> 22:39.420
And...?

22:39.460 --> 22:40.660
And... nothing.

22:40.690 --> 22:41.730
I went back to college,

22:41.790 --> 22:43.306
he said he would follow me,
and he didn't.

22:43.330 --> 22:44.430
And that's it?

22:45.860 --> 22:47.560
We called, we wrote.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.730
Time passed,

22:48.800 --> 22:49.800
life happened.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.670
I met your dad,
and you know the rest.

22:51.740 --> 22:53.070
You were in love.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.410
Mom, this is fate!

22:54.440 --> 22:56.040
No, this is Hugo,
meddling,

22:56.070 --> 22:57.470
like the old days.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.940
The love locks!

22:59.980 --> 23:01.550
Wow, there are so many now.

23:02.980 --> 23:05.520
Ah! All that love!

23:05.580 --> 23:07.580
It's beautiful.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.750
They're all rusted.

23:09.790 --> 23:10.850
Which means they lasted.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.000
Ah, the sound
of texting

23:27.070 --> 23:28.070
in the morning.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.980
You're awake.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.280
And you're smiling,

23:33.310 --> 23:34.610
which means it must be a boy.

23:34.650 --> 23:36.250
It's jp.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.350
Oh, "jp."

23:38.380 --> 23:39.650
Yesterday, it was "Jean Paul."

23:39.680 --> 23:41.250
That was yesterday.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.720
Would it be okay if he took me
to the university

23:44.760 --> 23:46.020
to register for classes?

23:47.360 --> 23:49.030
Oh.

23:49.060 --> 23:50.030
I thought I was
going to do that.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.060
It's just,
he's registering, too,

23:52.130 --> 23:53.830
and he can show me around.

23:56.570 --> 23:58.090
- I'll tell him no.
- Wait, wait, wait.

23:58.740 --> 23:59.740
Tell him yes.

24:00.710 --> 24:01.910
You sure?

24:01.940 --> 24:04.070
Yeah, you should go meet
some other students.

24:08.010 --> 24:09.380
I love you, mom.

24:09.410 --> 24:10.510
I love you, too, Lex.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.550
Have fun.

24:13.850 --> 24:15.150
Au revoir!

24:21.530 --> 24:24.030
Merci.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.700
Hey!

24:28.770 --> 24:30.230
Just saw Alexa ride off

24:30.270 --> 24:32.700
on the back
of jp's scooter.

24:32.740 --> 24:33.540
They looked like
they were having fun...

24:33.570 --> 24:34.670
Jack!

24:34.710 --> 24:35.540
Oh, calm down,
he's a great driver.

24:35.610 --> 24:36.810
Like you were?

24:38.080 --> 24:40.080
You're talking about
that one wrong turn I made?

24:40.110 --> 24:42.110
Up that one-way street?

24:42.150 --> 24:43.450
Yeah, we went... one way,

24:43.480 --> 24:45.420
and the traffic was all going
the other way.

24:46.990 --> 24:48.820
Here, I brought you

24:48.850 --> 24:50.790
your crossword.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.720
Oh. Quite the host.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.830
Yeah, that I am.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.430
You mind if I join you?

24:56.460 --> 24:57.460
Thank you.

25:05.270 --> 25:08.210
Hey, so, uh, what are you
painting these days?

25:09.570 --> 25:10.570
My nails?

25:12.410 --> 25:14.580
I'm not really
painting anymore.

25:14.610 --> 25:16.010
What?

25:16.050 --> 25:17.350
Why? That's terrible.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.120
I have an art magazine.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.150
It's only in New York,

25:20.220 --> 25:21.720
but we have
a nice little following.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.490
Oh.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.350
Well, that's great.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.690
Yeah, thanks.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.790
It's not what I planned,
but it's worked out well.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.030
Yeah, well,
life is what happens

25:30.060 --> 25:31.700
when you're making plans.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.300
We both know that.

25:37.570 --> 25:38.840
How's your father?

25:38.870 --> 25:39.870
He's good.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.770
He, uh, he took over
a hotel in nice.

25:41.810 --> 25:43.370
With my niece.

25:43.410 --> 25:44.340
Nice.

25:44.380 --> 25:46.510
Niece.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.650
Listen, i-i...

25:51.680 --> 25:53.480
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about, uh...

25:53.520 --> 25:54.420
About everything...

25:54.450 --> 25:55.550
It's okay...

25:55.590 --> 25:56.990
No listen, i-i just
want to say,

25:57.020 --> 25:58.890
you know my father
wanted me to stay behind,

25:58.960 --> 26:00.020
help run the business.

26:00.090 --> 26:01.106
I was going
to come and visit,

26:01.130 --> 26:02.330
but then, you know,

26:02.360 --> 26:03.366
a lot of time
had passed, and...

26:03.390 --> 26:05.230
Seriously,
it's okay.

26:06.430 --> 26:08.430
I don't even know
what we were thinking.

26:08.470 --> 26:11.200
Well, we weren't thinking,
we were in love.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.840
We were young.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.440
Actually, I think
the problem was

26:17.510 --> 26:20.180
you knocking that lock
out of my hands.

26:20.210 --> 26:21.580
Oh!

26:21.610 --> 26:23.950
Oh, as I recall,
your hands were a little shaky.

26:24.020 --> 26:26.050
Yeah, well, it was
freezing outside.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.290
It's okay,

26:28.320 --> 26:30.320
we didn't really believe
in that lock stuff anyway.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.690
Actually,

26:33.730 --> 26:35.166
they cut off all the locks
off of our bridge.

26:35.190 --> 26:36.190
What?

26:36.230 --> 26:37.330
Yeah, in fact,

26:37.400 --> 26:38.260
they cut the locks
off of all the Bridges

26:38.300 --> 26:39.300
all over Paris.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.860
I just saw them last night.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.000
Except for Pont Neuf.

26:43.070 --> 26:44.146
You know, those Bridges
date back to Napoleon,

26:44.170 --> 26:45.240
and all the weight

26:45.270 --> 26:46.376
from all the locks
on all the railings

26:46.400 --> 26:48.370
were causing them
to collapse,

26:48.440 --> 26:49.970
and it was becoming a hazard.

26:50.010 --> 26:51.480
Huh.

26:51.540 --> 26:53.210
The hazard of love.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.780
Pont Neuf is the last one,

26:55.810 --> 26:59.420
and then all of Paris
will be love-lock-less.

26:59.450 --> 27:01.020
Oh, Mrs. daltry.

27:01.050 --> 27:02.520
I don't know
if you've met Lindsey.

27:02.550 --> 27:03.490
Not officially.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.920
I'm Kathryn.

27:04.960 --> 27:05.720
Kathryn, so nice to meet you.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.090
Nice to meet you,
Lindsey.

27:07.130 --> 27:08.830
I didn't realize
you two were together.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.690
Oh, we're not.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.060
Well, we were...

27:12.100 --> 27:13.100
We're not.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.630
I see.

27:15.670 --> 27:16.830
Well, I won't keep you two.

27:16.870 --> 27:17.940
Enjoy your day.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.640
Oh, no, no, no, please,
uh, Mrs. daltry,

27:19.700 --> 27:20.940
I actually, uh,

27:21.010 --> 27:21.840
I have to go back to work.

27:21.870 --> 27:22.710
Thank you
for the crossword.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.110
Not a problem.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.610
And... 2 down
is "artichoke."

27:30.050 --> 27:30.880
Please, Kathryn,
join me.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.820
Thank you.

27:34.550 --> 27:36.196
Jack's turned this
into such a charming place

27:36.220 --> 27:37.290
over the years.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.460
When my husband and i
first stayed here...

27:39.490 --> 27:40.590
Merci.

27:40.630 --> 27:41.930
It was just
a hole in the wall.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.330
Oh, when was that?

27:43.360 --> 27:45.100
Our honeymoon, 40 years ago.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.300
Whoa.

27:46.330 --> 27:47.430
Are you back to celebrate?

27:47.470 --> 27:48.770
No. He died.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.230
Oh.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.670
I'm so sorry.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.500
It's been two years now.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.470
We would come here

27:55.540 --> 27:57.070
every anniversary.

27:57.140 --> 27:59.380
This is
my first time back since.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.240
I thought if I could just,

28:01.280 --> 28:03.080
I don't know,
see everything again,

28:03.110 --> 28:05.180
I could hold on to the memories.

28:05.220 --> 28:06.820
That sounds silly,
i know.

28:06.850 --> 28:08.890
It doesn't sound silly at all.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.566
It sounds like you had
a wonderful marriage.

28:10.590 --> 28:12.790
We did.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.606
You know, I'm visiting
a friend today,

28:16.630 --> 28:18.060
who has an art studio.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.660
Sort of an artist/meddler.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.770
Would you care to join?

28:21.800 --> 28:23.470
Well, I wouldn't want
to intrude...

28:23.530 --> 28:26.470
Oh, trust me,
he is "un-intrudable."

28:27.370 --> 28:28.310
Sounds intriguing.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.340
I'd love to.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.540
I love it already!

28:33.610 --> 28:35.250
Come on, I'll
show you the dorms.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.750
You're in the best one.

28:36.780 --> 28:37.850
Okay.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.080
The art department
is over there.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.520
And the math department?

28:42.590 --> 28:44.090
Just across the way.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.220
We can wave to each other
through the windows!

28:47.560 --> 28:50.260
So your mother
went here?

28:50.290 --> 28:52.030
Yeah, a semester abroad,
just like me,

28:52.060 --> 28:54.560
but I cannot believe
she never came back!

28:54.630 --> 28:55.770
Well, she's here
now, though.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.570
Yeah, she is.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.600
Come on.

29:29.530 --> 29:30.770
Lindsey! Mon coeur.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.470
Hugo blanchett,
this is Kathryn daltry.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.740
Kathryn, this is Hugo.

29:35.810 --> 29:37.170
Ah, mon plaisir, madame.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.740
How do you do?

29:38.780 --> 29:40.040
Your work is incredible.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.710
Oh, well, thank you,
thank you.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.680
Half the people who come here
think the opposite.

29:43.720 --> 29:46.250
Well, it's the other half
you should listen to.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.880
Well, I wish
you were an art critic.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.890
You're not, huh?

29:48.920 --> 29:50.850
No, just a tourist.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.190
Oh, I doubt that.

29:53.660 --> 29:55.260
How you like your hotel?

29:55.290 --> 29:58.230
Uh, you could have
mentioned it's Jack's.

29:58.300 --> 29:59.660
What would be the fun in that?

29:59.700 --> 30:01.130
Oh, you never change.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.600
I hear he's single.

30:02.670 --> 30:03.670
Stay out of it, Hugo.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.670
Madame, how long
are you in town?

30:07.740 --> 30:09.670
Just a few days.

30:09.710 --> 30:10.970
Ah, yes...

30:11.010 --> 30:12.180
Enough for me
to paint you.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.940
Well, no...
I couldn't...

30:13.980 --> 30:14.950
Oh...

30:14.980 --> 30:16.110
Give me
one reason.

30:16.180 --> 30:17.880
Well, I'm sure I could
give you several.

30:17.920 --> 30:18.926
Hugo, maybe
another time...

30:18.950 --> 30:20.780
Ah, ah, ah!
How many times I told you,

30:20.820 --> 30:21.820
seize the moment.

30:21.890 --> 30:23.096
The moment is now,
carpe diem...

30:23.120 --> 30:24.120
Ah?

30:24.160 --> 30:25.060
It would be...

30:25.090 --> 30:26.120
An honor.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.690
Just a quick sketch, hmm?

30:27.760 --> 30:28.830
S'il vous plait?

30:28.890 --> 30:30.406
Well, I suppose
that would be all right.

30:30.430 --> 30:32.036
Yes. Lindsey, go gesso
the canvas, please?

30:32.060 --> 30:33.960
Oh, I haven't
done that in...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.030
In 20 years, I know.
She was my best student.

30:36.070 --> 30:37.500
He's prone
to exaggeration...

30:37.540 --> 30:39.340
Well, we'll never know,
'cause you quit!

30:39.370 --> 30:41.146
If you've forgotten,
it's the brush, the paint,

30:41.170 --> 30:42.110
it's all coming back
to you now?

30:42.140 --> 30:43.240
Yes, maestro.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.680
Now...

30:50.550 --> 30:53.680
You have a sadness
in your eyes.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.320
And a joy.

30:57.390 --> 30:59.390
I'll try to catch both.

31:00.390 --> 31:01.560
Hmm?

31:29.320 --> 31:30.320
Coming!

31:34.030 --> 31:35.060
Wow.

31:35.090 --> 31:37.430
These are for you.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.260
Thank you.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.060
You shouldn't have.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.160
I didn't.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.130
They're from... "Trent greer"?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.170
Thank you.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.770
I thought you were
allergic to roses.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.370
Not anymore.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.610
Are you...

31:56.310 --> 31:57.880
Waiting for a tip?

31:59.320 --> 32:00.920
No. Nope, I'm good.

32:00.950 --> 32:02.590
Okay.

32:02.650 --> 32:03.950
Well then, thank you.

32:03.990 --> 32:04.990
Yeah, don't mention it!

32:21.410 --> 32:22.816
Ah, Lindsey,
i was hoping to see you.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.940
Won't you join me?

32:24.980 --> 32:27.180
How was your sitting
with Hugo?

32:28.080 --> 32:28.980
He's very opinionated.

32:29.010 --> 32:30.010
He is.

32:30.050 --> 32:30.980
And demanding.

32:31.020 --> 32:32.220
That too.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.620
He wouldn't
show me the sketch.

32:33.650 --> 32:34.650
And he won't,

32:34.690 --> 32:36.050
not until he's finished.

32:36.090 --> 32:37.050
Are you going back?

32:37.090 --> 32:37.920
No, I don't
think so,

32:37.960 --> 32:40.190
but thank you
for the introduction.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.620
I mean, if things
were different, perhaps, but...

32:44.330 --> 32:46.300
I don't think
i should have come back here.

32:46.330 --> 32:47.630
Hmm.

32:47.670 --> 32:48.746
I've had those same thoughts,

32:48.770 --> 32:49.906
and if it weren't
for my daughter,

32:49.930 --> 32:51.670
I probably wouldn't have.

32:52.740 --> 32:55.610
You fell in love in Paris.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.980
A long time ago.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.480
Ah...

33:01.510 --> 33:03.210
James and i
had the best times here.

33:03.250 --> 33:05.250
Just walking
and talking,

33:05.280 --> 33:06.520
nothing out of the ordinary,

33:06.550 --> 33:09.350
yet somehow extraordinary.

33:09.390 --> 33:12.090
You're very lucky
to have had a love like that.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.120
Yes, I am.

33:16.030 --> 33:17.690
I know we've just met,

33:17.730 --> 33:19.560
and I am no expert on love,

33:19.600 --> 33:21.200
but I can't help but think

33:21.230 --> 33:23.230
he'd want you to be
happy like that again.

33:23.270 --> 33:25.100
That's exactly what he'd want.

33:25.140 --> 33:26.700
And if only I could.

33:34.310 --> 33:35.810
Where have you been?

33:38.420 --> 33:39.450
Oh.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.820
Uh, folding towels?

33:42.220 --> 33:43.790
I thought you were Alexa.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.420
Oh, she's not back yet?

33:45.460 --> 33:47.360
Or answering her cell.

33:47.390 --> 33:48.430
All right, well,

33:48.460 --> 33:49.630
I left a message with jp.

33:49.660 --> 33:50.906
They probably just
lost track of time.

33:50.930 --> 33:52.960
Hey, how long have you known
this jp kid?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.100
Um, I don't know,
a couple of months.

33:55.130 --> 33:56.070
That's it?

33:56.100 --> 33:57.300
He's a good kid.

33:57.340 --> 33:59.470
He's studying mathematics.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.200
I mean, how dangerous
can he be?

34:04.440 --> 34:05.780
Okay.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.110
You know what,
grab your coat.

34:08.150 --> 34:11.280
We're going
for a walk.

34:13.580 --> 34:17.620
So, if you were
two young people,

34:17.659 --> 34:19.260
and you were in love,

34:19.290 --> 34:20.389
where would you go?

34:20.420 --> 34:21.290
In love?

34:21.330 --> 34:22.630
They just met yesterday.

34:22.659 --> 34:23.429
How long did it take us?

34:23.460 --> 34:24.606
Okay, well,
that was different.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.000
If you say so.

34:26.030 --> 34:27.760
This can only
end one way.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.000
So if something ends,

34:29.030 --> 34:30.600
it should have
never started?

34:30.630 --> 34:32.070
I just don't want them
to go through

34:32.100 --> 34:34.440
what we went through.

34:34.469 --> 34:36.010
We were happy.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.570
We were.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.909
So "Trent greer"
of greer publishing,

34:39.940 --> 34:42.909
offices in New York,
London, and Paris.

34:42.949 --> 34:44.650
Google.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.320
You googled my roses?

34:46.350 --> 34:48.320
I googled
your roses.

34:48.350 --> 34:50.449
How come he didn't know
you were allergic?

34:50.489 --> 34:53.520
He's... he's trying
to buy my magazine.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.530
Oh, so they're
business roses?

34:55.560 --> 34:57.090
Yeah, business roses.

34:57.130 --> 34:58.930
Oh...

34:58.960 --> 35:00.100
'Kay.

35:00.130 --> 35:01.300
Yeah.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.000
Mademoiselle.

35:03.030 --> 35:04.100
Oh, merci.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.780
Remember that
picnic we had here?

35:11.810 --> 35:14.480
Yeah, I remember
a lot of ants.

35:14.510 --> 35:16.650
And that little dog
who stole our sandwiches?

35:16.680 --> 35:17.980
And a thunderstorm.

35:21.490 --> 35:23.620
So, what was
your husband like?

35:23.650 --> 35:24.620
My ex?
My ex-husband?

35:24.660 --> 35:25.690
Your ex-husband,

35:25.720 --> 35:26.520
what was
your ex-husband like?

35:26.560 --> 35:30.390
Um, pretty much...
The opposite of you.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.130
Ouch.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.560
No, you know, I think

35:33.600 --> 35:36.300
I just didn't want
to be reminded of you.

35:36.330 --> 35:38.700
Or us.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.300
Anyway, it didn't
last long.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.810
Well, I'm sorry
about that.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.470
No, it's fine.

35:43.510 --> 35:45.510
It's almost
as old-news as us.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.740
Plus, I got Alexa out of it,
so I'm grateful for that.

35:47.780 --> 35:50.210
Yeah, you should be.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.880
I'm going to go out on a limb

35:52.920 --> 35:55.220
and guess
you never said, "i do"?

35:55.250 --> 35:57.150
I did not.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.190
Still dodging
the commitment thing, huh?

35:59.220 --> 36:00.266
No, I'm very much
committed.

36:00.290 --> 36:02.390
I'm committed to the hotel.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.430
You two seem
very happy together.

36:05.460 --> 36:07.600
Yeah, we have
a great relationship.

36:07.630 --> 36:10.200
You know, we have
our ups and downs,

36:10.230 --> 36:12.200
but, uh... all in all,

36:12.240 --> 36:14.740
we are pretty good.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.230
Voila.

36:40.260 --> 36:41.630
How did you know
they'd be here?

36:41.670 --> 36:42.800
Jp teaches
tango lessons here

36:42.830 --> 36:43.730
on mondays.

36:43.770 --> 36:45.900
Ah. Well, you could
have just told me that.

36:45.940 --> 36:48.840
Yeah, I could have
just told you that.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.710
Mom?

36:54.750 --> 36:56.010
Alexa.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.820
This is so
embarrassing.

37:01.850 --> 37:02.896
You weren't
answering your phone.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.390
My battery's dead.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.460
I'm sorry, madame,
we lost track of the time.

37:06.490 --> 37:09.660
Where did you
learn to tango?

37:09.690 --> 37:11.090
My grandfather
is from Argentina,

37:11.130 --> 37:12.900
but after
he and my grandmother divorce,

37:12.930 --> 37:13.960
he move here.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.130
Oh, he lost
his dance partner?

37:16.170 --> 37:17.600
He lost all
his dance partners.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.470
That is why he and
my grandmother divorce.

37:22.110 --> 37:23.440
Ah-ah-ah...

37:23.470 --> 37:24.610
Aw, yes...

37:24.640 --> 37:26.010
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.416
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Yes. Come on...

37:27.440 --> 37:28.410
No, Jack,
i don't remember...

37:28.450 --> 37:29.250
You remember.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.280
I don't...

37:30.310 --> 37:31.250
Yeah, just feel it.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.350
Feeling it?

37:32.380 --> 37:33.450
There you go.
Spin around.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.520
Do you like it?

37:35.550 --> 37:36.220
Wait a minute,
wait, here it...

37:36.250 --> 37:37.990
Oh! Oh, no...
Okay, whoa.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.290
Easy, now. Easy.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.460
Okay...

37:41.490 --> 37:42.590
Yes, I like it.
I like it.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.860
Oh...

37:44.900 --> 37:47.600
Here we go.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.200
Ah, yes.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.646
And then, give it
to me one more time.

37:57.840 --> 37:58.956
Thank you,
Mr. and Mrs. rayce,

37:58.980 --> 38:00.040
have a great night.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.050
All right, so my footwork
might be a little bit off.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.480
A little?

38:06.420 --> 38:07.620
Jack...

38:07.650 --> 38:09.290
There you are.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.450
You promised
to take me to dinner.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.660
Oh, was that tonight?

38:12.690 --> 38:15.120
No, but I am here.

38:16.330 --> 38:20.000
Um, Lindsey and Alexa,
this is Nicole.

38:20.030 --> 38:21.030
His girlfriend.

38:22.770 --> 38:24.870
So nice to meet you.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.400
And how are you
enjoying our city?

38:27.440 --> 38:29.210
Oh, you know what they say,

38:29.240 --> 38:30.110
a bad day in Paris

38:30.140 --> 38:32.580
is better than a good day
anywhere else.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.980
How charming.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.186
Come on, mom,
we have that thing.

38:37.210 --> 38:38.650
Right.
We have a thing.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.020
So...

38:44.050 --> 38:46.020
Where do you
want to go?

38:46.060 --> 38:47.360
Wherever you want.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.520
Um...

38:48.560 --> 38:50.990
I was thinking
Italian.

38:51.030 --> 38:52.030
Okay.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.060
Mm-hmm?

38:59.540 --> 39:00.670
You okay?

39:00.700 --> 39:01.770
Of course, I'm okay.

39:01.810 --> 39:03.840
Why wouldn't i
be okay?

39:03.870 --> 39:04.870
Just checking.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.980
Look who's worrying
about who.

39:10.110 --> 39:12.720
You guys just looked
so cute, dancing.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.280
You said
we looked terrible.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.020
But you were
terrible together.

39:16.050 --> 39:18.760
Yeah, well,
we're not together.

39:22.730 --> 39:24.360
Look at that.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.060
The city of lights.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.930
The city of love.

39:28.970 --> 39:30.570
Let's just stick
with city of lights.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.570
And the best
chocolate ever?

39:37.070 --> 39:38.940
Ooh...

39:38.980 --> 39:41.010
Well, "we'll always
have chocolate."

39:44.150 --> 39:45.950
Mm!
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.050
I hope it doesn't
go by too quickly.

39:50.090 --> 39:51.120
It will.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.570
I have
our whole day planned.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.900
I'd expect
nothing else.

40:07.940 --> 40:08.946
First, we'll see
the rue du tertre.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.586
There's a secret little
corner I want to show you.

40:10.610 --> 40:12.280
Maybe we should invite Jack.

40:13.380 --> 40:14.640
No, no, no, he's seen it all.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.580
Yeah, that's right,
i have seen it all.

40:17.610 --> 40:19.420
Hey, uh, Jean Paul, you mind

40:19.450 --> 40:20.556
saving some
of these pastries

40:20.580 --> 40:21.550
for some of
our other guests?

40:21.590 --> 40:22.720
Thank you.

40:26.860 --> 40:28.320
Ladies, how was your evening?

40:28.360 --> 40:29.560
Good.

40:29.590 --> 40:30.690
And dinner with Nicole?

40:30.730 --> 40:32.200
Oh, uh...

40:32.230 --> 40:33.660
You know, dinner's dinner.

40:33.700 --> 40:34.776
Would you like
another croissant?

40:34.800 --> 40:36.370
Oh, no, you were
going to save those

40:36.400 --> 40:37.670
for the other guests.

40:37.700 --> 40:38.940
Yeah.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.940
Hey, um,
you should know

40:40.970 --> 40:43.270
this, uh, thing,
with, uh, Nicole and I,

40:43.310 --> 40:46.680
it-it's nothing serious,
it's just casual.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.210
Okay.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.226
Yeah, you know, it's only
been, like, uh, a few weeks.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.480
Okay.

40:53.650 --> 40:55.520
That's actually, uh,
that's not true,

40:55.550 --> 40:57.520
it's been
a little longer than that.

40:57.550 --> 40:59.160
Cas'.

41:00.090 --> 41:01.920
Yes. Casual.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.730
Because you're committed
to your hotel.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.600
Yes... correct.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.900
So, I thought we'd start
with the rue du tertre,

41:14.940 --> 41:16.370
and then see the louvre.

41:16.410 --> 41:17.470
Mom...

41:17.510 --> 41:18.910
You are not
going to believe

41:18.940 --> 41:20.016
how small
that Mona Lisa is.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.786
Are we not going to talk
about this whole Jack thing?

41:21.810 --> 41:22.910
No.

41:22.950 --> 41:24.250
Because I'm here for you.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.326
And that's the only reason.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.820
Speaking
of which, um,

41:27.850 --> 41:30.050
could you be a little...
Less there for me?

41:34.590 --> 41:36.130
Okay,
maybe a little.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.290
Can I get you
anything, ladies?

41:38.330 --> 41:39.960
Jp, if you're free
tomorrow,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.930
we'd like to invite you
to an art show.

41:42.970 --> 41:44.130
I'm totally free.

41:44.170 --> 41:45.640
I thought you might be.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.250
It's just like
i pictured it!

41:56.280 --> 41:57.510
It hasn't
changed at all.

41:57.550 --> 41:58.650
Did you come here a lot?

41:58.680 --> 41:59.820
All the time.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.650
I used to come here
and paint.

42:01.690 --> 42:04.350
Maybe one day,
I'll come set up here, too.

42:04.390 --> 42:06.790
Excusez-moi, monsieur?

42:06.820 --> 42:09.860
Est-ce-que c'est possible
que-tu te souviens de moi?

42:09.890 --> 42:11.160
Pink easel?

42:11.200 --> 42:12.760
I used to come here

42:12.800 --> 42:14.200
a long, long time ago.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.170
Mais oui...

42:16.200 --> 42:18.530
The pink easel,
i remember.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.970
With a young artist
behind it,

42:21.000 --> 42:24.270
she wanted to paint
all of montmartre.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.050
We artists, we are
just children

42:29.080 --> 42:32.950
who refuse to lay down
their crayons, non?

42:45.430 --> 42:47.300
Kathryn!

42:47.330 --> 42:49.200
I wasn't sure
you'd come back.

42:49.230 --> 42:50.700
I wasn't going to,

42:50.730 --> 42:54.000
but something Lindsey said
made me change my mind.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.870
Well, I am charming
when you get to know me.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.340
Whatever she said,
I'm glad you're back.

42:59.380 --> 43:00.710
I was working
on your portrait.

43:00.740 --> 43:02.180
Oh, may I have a look?

43:02.210 --> 43:04.010
No, no, no, no, no...

43:04.050 --> 43:07.580
You, uh, can see it
at the show.

43:07.620 --> 43:09.650
You're putting it
in a show?

43:09.690 --> 43:10.850
You can't be serious.

43:10.890 --> 43:12.150
Tomorrow.
You come, hmm?

43:12.190 --> 43:13.936
Actually, I was planning
on leaving tomorrow.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.320
So soon?

43:15.360 --> 43:17.830
I really only came
to see it all again.

43:17.860 --> 43:19.430
Oh, you've
seen it all, huh?

43:19.460 --> 43:20.830
Non...

43:21.900 --> 43:23.500
Well, there is one more place.

43:23.530 --> 43:25.430
Yeah?

43:25.470 --> 43:27.000
Pont Neuf.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.110
Oh, Pont Neuf!

43:29.140 --> 43:30.740
The last love locks bridge.

43:30.770 --> 43:32.610
I hear
they're cutting off the locks.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.680
Yes, tragic.

43:36.050 --> 43:38.680
15 years ago,

43:38.720 --> 43:41.420
James surprised me
with an antique lock,

43:41.450 --> 43:42.390
heart-shaped,

43:42.420 --> 43:44.790
inscribed
with our names.

43:44.820 --> 43:49.760
We were likely the oldest
couple on that bridge.

43:49.790 --> 43:53.400
I thought I'd try to find it
and bring it back with me.

43:54.970 --> 43:56.970
Well, then let's go.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.130
Now?

43:58.170 --> 43:59.370
Yes, now.

43:59.400 --> 44:00.740
What better time?

44:00.770 --> 44:01.800
Oh, but surely,

44:01.840 --> 44:02.916
it would be
a fool's errand.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.470
Then you have
the right man for the job.

44:07.780 --> 44:10.780
Yes, we'll go,
we will find it.

44:10.810 --> 44:11.780
It doesn't matter.

44:11.820 --> 44:14.380
Well, it matters to you.

44:14.420 --> 44:17.490
And besides, I have
a confession to make.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.760
You have a lock
hanging there, too?

44:20.760 --> 44:22.290
The love of my life.

44:22.330 --> 44:23.930
But it was not meant to be.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.460
I'm sorry.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.260
Yes, well,
the time we had was short,

44:27.300 --> 44:28.700
but it was magic.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.630
So, how long

44:31.670 --> 44:34.900
did you and your James
have together?

44:34.940 --> 44:36.740
My whole life.

44:36.770 --> 44:38.740
I envy you both.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.430
Mom? What is it?

45:03.470 --> 45:04.500
Nothing.

45:08.410 --> 45:09.270
Oh, hey!

45:09.310 --> 45:11.110
Bonjour.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.270
Uh, madame?

45:12.310 --> 45:13.810
I am on lunch break,

45:13.840 --> 45:15.610
may I take you
and Alexa to the cafe?

45:16.480 --> 45:17.510
Aw...

45:17.550 --> 45:19.780
That's so sweet,
but, um,

45:19.820 --> 45:21.350
my mom and I have plans.

45:21.390 --> 45:22.280
Thank you, though.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.690
Of course.

45:23.720 --> 45:25.550
Another time.

45:25.590 --> 45:26.720
You know,
you two should go.

45:26.760 --> 45:27.720
No.

45:27.760 --> 45:28.720
Yes.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.066
I have to call Maggie
at the office anyway.

45:30.090 --> 45:31.490
Go.

45:31.530 --> 45:32.460
Are you sure?

45:32.500 --> 45:33.630
Yes, positive. Go!

45:33.660 --> 45:34.530
Okay, here.

45:34.560 --> 45:35.500
And my phone's
charged.

45:35.530 --> 45:36.630
Okay.

45:36.670 --> 45:37.630
How was
sightseeing?

45:37.670 --> 45:40.500
Sightseeing was great.

45:42.270 --> 45:44.570
Oh, what have
you got here?

45:44.610 --> 45:45.980
Oh, yeah...

45:46.010 --> 45:47.340
The cat guy.

45:47.380 --> 45:48.780
Cat guy.

45:50.350 --> 45:52.520
I... left a couple bikes
out there

45:52.550 --> 45:56.020
in case you wanted
to show Alexa the old route.

45:56.050 --> 45:57.750
Oh.

45:57.790 --> 45:59.190
Thanks, but she's
gone off with jp.

46:00.460 --> 46:01.490
Again?

46:03.530 --> 46:05.760
I'm gonna have to put
that guy on a double shift.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.500
Come on, give me a hand.

46:10.030 --> 46:11.530
Thank you, Jack,

46:11.570 --> 46:13.570
this is very thoughtful.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.500
That's me,
monsieur thoughtful.

46:15.540 --> 46:16.616
Help me take
these bike inside

46:16.640 --> 46:18.056
in case you and Alexa want
to take them out later...

46:18.080 --> 46:20.940
Or... we could go.

46:20.980 --> 46:22.140
Now.

46:24.250 --> 46:26.020
We?

46:26.050 --> 46:28.020
Oui.

46:31.720 --> 46:32.490
All right, you know what,
just give me a sec,

46:32.520 --> 46:34.220
I've got to make
a quick phone call.

47:11.030 --> 47:13.230
All right, here we go.

47:13.260 --> 47:15.260
Right up here.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.770
What do you mean?

47:16.800 --> 47:19.340
The bikes will be fine.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.500
You sure?

47:20.540 --> 47:21.500
Yeah.

47:21.540 --> 47:23.240
Come on.

47:23.270 --> 47:24.610
Jack,
isn't it closed?

47:24.640 --> 47:26.310
Come on.

47:36.050 --> 47:38.050
What have you got
up your sleeve?

47:41.560 --> 47:43.290
Oh, yeah.

47:43.330 --> 47:45.230
Yeah.

47:54.810 --> 47:57.970
I won't even ask
how you made this happen.

47:58.010 --> 48:00.880
Let's just say I have
friends in low places.

48:00.910 --> 48:02.950
Hmm, so
nothing's changed.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.450
Nope.

48:06.220 --> 48:07.050
The first time
we came here,

48:07.080 --> 48:08.620
you thought "monet"
was a champagne.

48:08.650 --> 48:10.390
It isn't?

48:12.160 --> 48:13.960
Thank you for
bringing me here.

48:13.990 --> 48:15.036
You know, it was always
so crowded before,

48:15.060 --> 48:17.290
I never really saw these.

48:17.330 --> 48:18.706
It's all part
of the Paris experience.

48:18.730 --> 48:19.830
Hmm,

48:19.860 --> 48:21.830
you do this
for all your guests?

48:21.870 --> 48:23.000
Yeah, of course.

48:23.030 --> 48:24.406
Later this afternoon, I'll be
closing down the louvre

48:24.430 --> 48:25.970
for a ping pong tournament.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.070
No, come on,

48:27.100 --> 48:28.416
I've never brought
a guest back here.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.470
I've never brought
anyone back here.

48:30.510 --> 48:31.870
I'm honored.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.280
What?

48:36.510 --> 48:37.510
Nothing.

48:39.280 --> 48:42.550
Just, looking at you, uh...

48:42.590 --> 48:44.520
I wanted to say three words.

48:46.090 --> 48:47.690
What three words?

48:50.290 --> 48:53.030
"Ooh la la."

48:57.600 --> 49:01.370
"Life is the art of drawing
without an eraser."

49:03.110 --> 49:04.040
Who said that?

49:04.070 --> 49:05.710
You did.

49:05.740 --> 49:06.880
What? I mean...

49:06.910 --> 49:07.910
If I said that,

49:07.940 --> 49:10.280
I was probably just
quoting Hugo or something.

49:10.310 --> 49:13.420
Yeah, well,
it stayed.

49:13.450 --> 49:15.920
I mean, I've made
a few decisions

49:15.950 --> 49:17.590
I wish I could erase.

49:17.620 --> 49:20.090
Who hasn't had those?

49:22.890 --> 49:25.390
What happened to those
two people that were us?

49:25.430 --> 49:27.930
Life, I guess.

49:27.960 --> 49:30.800
I thought for sure
I'd be married by now,

49:30.830 --> 49:34.200
with a couple kids,
a dog, maybe two.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.210
Really?

49:36.240 --> 49:38.410
Yeah, one day, but...

49:38.440 --> 49:40.410
"One day" never happened.

49:40.440 --> 49:41.410
Yet.

49:41.440 --> 49:42.510
You know, maybe

49:42.550 --> 49:44.710
you're placing too much
expectation on "one day."

49:44.750 --> 49:46.580
Nah. Mm-mm.

49:46.620 --> 49:47.980
It's your fault.

49:48.020 --> 49:49.140
You're a hard act to follow.

49:51.820 --> 49:57.130
Obviously, not that hard,
because you didn't follow... me.

49:58.930 --> 50:01.600
Where's that eraser
when you need it?

50:06.300 --> 50:07.300
Pardon, monsieur?

50:09.510 --> 50:10.610
Oh. Yeah, okay.

50:10.640 --> 50:12.470
Come on,
we gotta go.

50:12.510 --> 50:13.910
No, they're...

50:13.940 --> 50:16.580
They're gonna
wax the floors.

50:16.610 --> 50:17.880
Come on.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.050
Lindsey, come on!

50:25.720 --> 50:27.160
Yeah, and have it by then.

50:27.190 --> 50:28.120
We should have
the contracts signed...

50:28.160 --> 50:29.190
Merci.

50:29.230 --> 50:30.630
By Monday.
Perfect.

50:30.660 --> 50:32.660
That is great.
Okay.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.900
Lindsey!

50:38.030 --> 50:40.140
Trent?

50:40.170 --> 50:41.170
I wanted
to surprise you.

50:43.170 --> 50:45.440
Well, you-you did.

50:45.480 --> 50:46.840
What a surprise.

50:46.880 --> 50:47.680
Your assistant said
you were staying here,

50:47.710 --> 50:48.956
and I thought
it would be convenient.

50:48.980 --> 50:51.280
Wow...
How-how great.

50:51.310 --> 50:52.396
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

50:52.420 --> 50:54.220
Come, let's have a drink.

50:54.250 --> 50:55.320
Great, okay.

50:56.350 --> 50:57.350
Come on.

51:00.820 --> 51:02.120
All right, well,

51:02.160 --> 51:04.490
take care of his bags,
i guess.

51:04.530 --> 51:06.030
Throw them
in the street?

51:06.060 --> 51:08.030
Yeah.

51:08.060 --> 51:10.330
I'm kidding.
Bring 'em in.

51:16.610 --> 51:18.470
Right this way,
just watch your step.

51:18.510 --> 51:19.480
There we go.

51:19.510 --> 51:22.580
Oops, sorry, it's, uh,
a little narrow in here.

51:22.610 --> 51:24.380
And we're just back here.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.450
Here we are.

51:27.480 --> 51:29.150
Grab that, thanks.

51:29.190 --> 51:30.750
Okay...

51:32.590 --> 51:34.720
Voila, huh?

51:41.300 --> 51:42.560
Huh...

51:42.600 --> 51:44.270
This is cozy.

51:44.300 --> 51:45.430
Where should I put this?

51:45.470 --> 51:46.840
Uh, the hallway?

51:46.870 --> 51:47.770
Can't you find him
a better room?

51:47.800 --> 51:49.970
Yeah, uh, no, sorry,
we're all booked up.

51:50.010 --> 51:51.170
Valentine's day.

51:51.210 --> 51:53.610
That's not
for a while yet.

51:53.640 --> 51:56.250
Ah, well, you know Paris,
any excuse to celebrate love.

51:57.780 --> 51:58.780
Thank you, sir.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.080
Um...

52:02.120 --> 52:03.596
On the chance that
you're free tonight,

52:03.620 --> 52:05.950
I did make us reservations
for the three of us

52:05.990 --> 52:07.290
at the St. germain.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.120
Oh, man,
i can't make it.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.090
I'm so sorry, I'm working
the front desk tonight.

52:13.060 --> 52:14.760
I meant Lindsey
and her daughter.

52:14.800 --> 52:15.930
Oh...

52:15.970 --> 52:18.430
Duh, of course, you did.

52:18.470 --> 52:20.140
I'm sorry about that.

52:20.170 --> 52:22.500
Um, anything else
i can help you with?

52:22.540 --> 52:24.340
We're good,
thank you.

52:24.370 --> 52:25.486
Uh, you know what,
that's fine.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.516
You're gonna need it
if you're going to St. germain,

52:27.540 --> 52:29.980
and if I were you,
i would not order the fish.

52:31.550 --> 52:32.820
Great, thank you
very much.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.150
Excuse me,

52:34.180 --> 52:35.380
tight fit.

52:35.420 --> 52:36.820
Okay...

52:36.850 --> 52:37.890
This is something, huh?

52:37.920 --> 52:39.190
Wow, this room is so small...

52:39.220 --> 52:41.220
I'm not even sure it's a room.

52:41.260 --> 52:42.120
You know, I've been
in smaller.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.060
Really?

52:43.090 --> 52:44.130
Never.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.460
So, I hope it's
all right that I'm here.

52:48.500 --> 52:49.360
I just thought

52:49.400 --> 52:50.806
it was really
the perfect opportunity

52:50.830 --> 52:53.740
to show you
our Paris office.

52:53.770 --> 52:55.870
You are persistent.

52:55.910 --> 52:56.710
Well...

52:56.740 --> 52:58.870
Maybe, um,
maybe after dinner?

52:58.910 --> 52:59.740
Hold on one second.

52:59.780 --> 53:01.180
Yup. Trent.

53:01.210 --> 53:02.140
Mm-hmm.

53:02.180 --> 53:05.050
Well, I mean, it's not
a great time, but, uh...

53:05.080 --> 53:06.150
You know, we...

53:06.180 --> 53:07.326
Yeah, no, it's okay.
Sorry, hold on...

53:07.350 --> 53:08.320
It's okay...

53:08.350 --> 53:10.150
Mm-hmm. Yup, mm-hmm.

53:11.250 --> 53:12.890
Uh, well, you tell them

53:12.920 --> 53:15.320
when I'm back
in the states that...

53:34.880 --> 53:36.040
Hugo...

53:36.080 --> 53:38.250
Bonsoir, Nicholas.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.310
Please...

53:40.250 --> 53:41.380
Merci.

53:41.420 --> 53:42.780
Well, I'm sorry

53:42.820 --> 53:44.590
that we couldn't find your lock.

53:44.620 --> 53:45.620
Here, let me.

53:46.620 --> 53:47.390
Thank you.

53:47.420 --> 53:50.790
It was good of you
to indulge me.

53:50.830 --> 53:52.690
I don't know
what I was thinking.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.700
Well, you were
thinking about love,

53:54.730 --> 53:56.970
which does strange things
to everyone.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.130
So maybe I go back
to the bridge,

53:59.170 --> 54:00.900
and I take a flashlight

54:00.940 --> 54:02.540
and bolt cutters.

54:02.570 --> 54:04.370
No, if you do,
you'll be arrested.

54:04.410 --> 54:06.110
Well, it won't be
the first time.

54:06.140 --> 54:09.610
Oh, dear.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.260
It makes me happy
when you laugh.

54:13.980 --> 54:15.380
It's been a while.

54:15.420 --> 54:16.650
How long has it been

54:16.690 --> 54:19.490
since you've had a...
A decadent, uh...

54:19.520 --> 54:20.560
Meal?

54:20.590 --> 54:21.590
Dessert.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.060
Nicholas!

54:26.100 --> 54:27.330
Chocolat!

54:27.360 --> 54:29.160
Oui, monsieur.
Tout de suite.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.200
You will love this.

54:40.610 --> 54:42.580
I'm really sorry that
Alexa couldn't join us.

54:42.610 --> 54:43.680
Merci.

54:43.710 --> 54:44.986
Well, she didn't
want to intrude,

54:45.010 --> 54:46.320
and also,

54:46.350 --> 54:48.520
she's busy falling
in love with someone

54:48.550 --> 54:50.350
she's only known
two days.

54:50.390 --> 54:53.460
Well, who hasn't
done that, right?

54:54.390 --> 54:57.330
Are you trying
to sweep me off my feet

54:57.360 --> 54:58.460
so you can get
my magazine?

54:58.490 --> 55:00.160
Please tell me it's working.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.500
One foot's
off the ground.

55:01.530 --> 55:02.860
To the other foot.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.270
Oh.

55:04.300 --> 55:05.670
You are good.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.600
Lindsey, how about
we don't talk business tonight?

55:15.880 --> 55:18.180
Oh. Oh...
Oh, so this would be a...

55:18.210 --> 55:19.820
Some might
call it a "date."

55:19.850 --> 55:20.880
Right,
one of those.

55:20.920 --> 55:21.980
Or not...

55:22.020 --> 55:23.120
No, no, no, we could...

55:23.150 --> 55:24.366
No, we could
call it a date, yeah.

55:24.390 --> 55:25.550
Okay. Good.

55:25.590 --> 55:28.190
I'm sorry, I'm a little...
I'm a little out of practice.

55:28.220 --> 55:30.460
Actually, I am, too, so...

55:30.490 --> 55:32.460
Why do I find that
hard to believe?

55:33.830 --> 55:35.160
It's true.

55:35.200 --> 55:38.730
I, uh... I work, like, 24/7,

55:38.770 --> 55:40.740
and, really,
i am trying to change that.

55:40.770 --> 55:42.870
Starting about 30 seconds ago.

55:46.010 --> 55:46.980
How am I doing?

55:47.010 --> 55:48.010
Pretty good.

55:48.040 --> 55:48.980
- You think?
- Mm-hmm.

55:49.010 --> 55:50.880
Caviar...

55:50.910 --> 55:53.320
Oh, look at this.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.950
- Very good.
- Yeah?

56:32.390 --> 56:34.320
♪ Coo-coo...

56:36.160 --> 56:38.230
You're always working.

56:38.260 --> 56:39.190
Oh, really?

56:39.230 --> 56:41.360
I always feel like
I'm not working enough.

56:45.230 --> 56:46.400
I see she's more

56:46.440 --> 56:47.600
than just a hotel guest.

56:47.640 --> 56:48.870
Oh, this?

56:48.910 --> 56:51.740
Oh, come on, it was
a lifetime ago.

56:51.770 --> 56:53.580
You look happy.

56:53.610 --> 56:56.480
Yeah, well, everybody
looks happy in sketches.

56:56.510 --> 56:58.610
But not everyone
digs up old pictures.

56:58.650 --> 57:01.580
All right, well, you know,

57:01.620 --> 57:02.980
maybe seeing her here

57:03.020 --> 57:04.620
has stirred up
some old memories,

57:04.650 --> 57:07.220
but I told you,
it was a lifetime ago.

57:07.260 --> 57:09.260
When is she leaving?

57:09.290 --> 57:11.960
Um... a couple of days.

57:11.990 --> 57:13.600
Is it possible
she could leave sooner?

57:16.030 --> 57:17.310
Come on, her life
is in New York.

57:18.630 --> 57:20.240
That's good,

57:20.270 --> 57:22.240
because...

57:22.270 --> 57:25.010
I am going to Milan
next weekend,

57:25.040 --> 57:26.910
and I want you to come with me.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.980
Milan, wow...

57:31.010 --> 57:32.980
Uh, I wish I could, but...

57:33.020 --> 57:33.920
The hotel.

57:33.950 --> 57:35.180
I can't.

57:35.220 --> 57:37.120
Of course, you can,
it's your hotel.

57:38.860 --> 57:40.960
Uh, coming!

57:40.990 --> 57:42.820
I'm sorry.

57:50.170 --> 57:51.530
All right,
you are all set.

57:51.570 --> 57:53.500
Here are your keys,
Owen has your bags,

57:53.540 --> 57:55.270
and enjoy your stay.

57:55.300 --> 57:56.340
Merci, monsieur.

57:58.570 --> 58:00.010
Hey!

58:00.040 --> 58:01.140
How was St. germain?

58:01.180 --> 58:02.340
Well, you were right,

58:02.380 --> 58:03.726
we should not
have ordered the fish.

58:03.750 --> 58:05.180
I told you.

58:06.550 --> 58:08.680
Oh, Trent, this is
my daughter.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.390
Oh, it is nice
to meet you, Alexa.

58:10.420 --> 58:11.950
You, too.

58:11.990 --> 58:13.236
- And you've already met jp.
- Of course.

58:13.260 --> 58:14.190
Thank you for that
generous tip, sir.

58:14.220 --> 58:15.706
So, what have you two
been up to tonight?

58:15.730 --> 58:17.230
Oh, we had
so much fun.

58:17.260 --> 58:17.990
We had bread
and cheese.

58:18.030 --> 58:19.660
And we walked
along the seine.

58:19.700 --> 58:20.700
Oh, don't
forget the rock.

58:20.730 --> 58:22.206
Oh, we found this rock
that's shaped like a heart!

58:22.230 --> 58:23.230
It's good luck.

58:23.270 --> 58:24.230
What did you guys do?

58:24.270 --> 58:26.400
We had an amazing dinner,

58:26.440 --> 58:28.140
and an amazing dessert,

58:28.170 --> 58:30.640
and then Trent showed me
his offices here, which are...

58:30.670 --> 58:32.510
Amazing?

58:33.710 --> 58:34.540
Oh, hey!

58:34.580 --> 58:37.810
Guys, here is
my girlfriend, Nicole,

58:37.850 --> 58:39.680
who is also amazing.

58:41.420 --> 58:43.080
Ah, party in the lobby!

58:43.120 --> 58:44.390
Ah, and this is
Kathryn daltry.

58:44.420 --> 58:45.550
Hello.

58:45.590 --> 58:47.260
Yes, the exquisite
Kathryn daltry.

58:47.290 --> 58:49.160
Oh, Hugo,
you are too kind.

58:49.190 --> 58:51.690
Ah, well, no one's ever
accused me of that before.

58:51.730 --> 58:52.730
Agreed.

58:54.130 --> 58:56.670
And this is
Hugo blanchett the artist.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.730
Well, I'm more than that,
but it will do for now.

58:58.770 --> 59:00.246
Hugo, pleasure to meet you Trent
greer.

59:00.270 --> 59:01.500
Bonjour, Mr. greer.

59:01.540 --> 59:04.510
Hugo is Alexa's
painting teacher.

59:04.540 --> 59:06.240
Yours too.

59:06.280 --> 59:08.710
I did not know
you painted.

59:10.410 --> 59:12.510
Well, it's sad to say,
she's given it up.

59:13.780 --> 59:14.920
Hugo took me
to Pont Neuf.

59:14.950 --> 59:17.090
We searched for hours
for my lock.

59:17.120 --> 59:18.350
You have a lock
on the bridge?

59:18.390 --> 59:20.520
Mm-hmm, I thought
i might find it

59:20.560 --> 59:22.190
before the city
cuts them off.

59:22.230 --> 59:24.190
Cuts them off?

59:24.230 --> 59:26.030
Yes, well, they have
their reasons, I suppose.

59:26.060 --> 59:28.130
That's awful.

59:28.160 --> 59:29.760
It's just a bridge, sweetie.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.430
Yeah, but
all those promises.

59:31.470 --> 59:32.200
I admit,

59:32.240 --> 59:33.770
I'm sentimental
about it, too.

59:33.800 --> 59:35.970
Uh, innkeeper,

59:36.010 --> 59:37.970
uh, uh, drinks
for all my friends.

59:38.010 --> 59:40.140
Just put it on my tab.

59:40.180 --> 59:41.610
Hugo, you don't
have a tab.

59:41.640 --> 59:43.140
Well, what better time
to start one.

59:47.250 --> 59:48.550
Did you decide?

59:48.580 --> 59:49.420
About what?

59:49.450 --> 59:50.820
The magazine.

59:50.850 --> 59:53.920
Actually, we didn't
even talk about it.

59:53.960 --> 59:55.560
So it was a date?

59:55.590 --> 59:57.290
Kind of.

59:57.330 --> 59:59.090
What about Jack?

59:59.130 --> 01:00:00.900
What about him?

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.100
So, I get to call dad
and tell him

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.146
you're not just
seeing somebody,

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:05.400
but two somebodies.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.800
I am not!

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.600
And don't you dare.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640
I'm gonna!

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.090
Alexa, my company is
sponsoring a concert series

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.090
at le zenith next weekend,

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.236
and I thought
i would leave two tickets

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.760
for you and jp
at will call.

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:31.830
If your mom
is okay with that.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.060
Yeah.
Yeah, thank you.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.130
That's so nice.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.030
Great. Great.
Um, I have to run,

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.430
but, um, you sure
you won't come with me?

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:42.440
Thanks, but we're helping Hugo
set up for his show.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.646
Right, right,
what time is that?

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:45.140
4:00 P.M.
les archives.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:46.780
- The archives?
- The archives.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:47.810
Okay.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.956
I have a 4:00
editor's meeting,

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.210
but I will, uh,
i will meet you there.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.810
Sounds like a plan.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.280
Terrific.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.380
Okay, I'm on my way.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.990
Uh, would you mind

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.096
taking these
to Hugo for me? Thanks.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.420
What is it?

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.920
Um, they're croissants.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.390
I lost a bet.

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:19.140
Oh!

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.210
Croissants!

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.956
- From Jack.
- Ah, he's man of honor.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.310
I'm not even
going to ask

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:24.350
what the bet was.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.850
Well, there's
a good choice.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.950
Hey, where is
everything?

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.780
Well, it went
to the gallery.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.350
They're coming
for the last load.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:31.496
I thought we were
going to help.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.920
Well, you are.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.620
You see, this could
be your best work.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.690
Hugo...

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.030
The first
step back is,

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.130
you take the brush.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.430
Alexa can finish it.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.130
No, Alexa has her own
life to paint,

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:44.100
you need to finish yours.

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:46.000
What if I can't?

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.140
Of course you can.

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:51.110
Now, while you are here,
allow yourself to be...

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.010
The artist.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040
Hmm?

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.310
Take the brush.

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:58.980
Hmm?

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.520
And Alexa and I will be
putting together the gallery

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:07.560
for a brilliant show...

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.560
Right, now,
the most important thing

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:12.490
about hanging a painting

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:13.800
is the light.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.330
And, uh...

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.040
You can make
a really bad painting

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:24.170
look like a masterpiece
with the right light, huh?

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.810
Oh, my goodness.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.150
Oh, wow.

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:15.120
Art, like love,
has no cure,

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.460
but if it is true,
it will stay with you.

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:18.760
Hmm?

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:19.730
Are you trying

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.530
to sell us a painting, Hugo?

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.130
Of course! Of course!

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.360
But I mean every word.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.570
One day, you'll be
hanging your work here.

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:31.540
Maybe. One day.

01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:33.456
When the semester's over,
you can come to New York?

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.780
I can apply
to grad school.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:35.610
We can have the whole
summer together,

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.150
and I'll show you
all the sights,

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.580
starting with
the statue of Liberty,

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:39.480
which is actually...

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.480
French.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:47.620
Oh, excusez-moi.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.020
Kathryn!

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.660
Oh, Hugo.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.660
You made it.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.000
Well, I realized
it was something

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:57.000
I just did not
want to miss.

01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.400
I'm so happy you came.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:59.400
Come, I'll show you something.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.770
Okay.

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.440
Oh...

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:06.910
Yes?

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.940
Oh, wow.

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.250
Oh, did I make you cry?

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.110
Oh...

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.150
Hmm?

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.580
You've made me, uh...

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.950
You've made me look
so full of life, and...

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:19.450
Well, I paint what I see.

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:21.820
It's just that, um,...

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:24.190
It's just that
I've felt so sad, and...

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:25.260
Well, look,

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:26.690
you can see both.

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.360
Life and love,
it's complicated.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.330
That's what
makes it great.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.170
Thank you, Hugo.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.010
Mon plaisir, madame.

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:47.520
Oh, yeah,
there we go,

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.950
I see it, yup.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.390
It's a hamburger
and a spatula.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.190
Oh, no, wait a minute,

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.620
it's a grilled cheese
and a spatula.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.830
You must be hungry.

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:00.530
It's supposed to be
two people in love,

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.300
at least that's
what Hugo says.

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:03.870
Oh, yeah, okay,
i see it now...

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.270
- Really?
- No.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:09.740
I didn't know
you were coming.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.540
Yeah, uh,
Hugo invited me.

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:12.570
Huh.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.480
Where's Nicole?

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:16.980
Um, he said
there wasn't enough room

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.650
for a plus-one.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.650
Hmm.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.580
He never gives up.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.220
There's something
to be said about that.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.160
Where's
your plus-one?

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.820
He had business,
he'll be here later.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.460
Great.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.900
So... publishing.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.400
Yup.

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.270
Yup, publishing.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.200
Let me guess
how you guys met.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.370
It's a quaint
little bookshop in soho.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.540
You walk in,
your eyes meet,

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:45.670
you both reach
for the same renoir book...

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:46.740
Close.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.840
Editors' convention,
500 people.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.210
Oh, hot.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:53.110
Be still
my beating heart.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.120
How did you
and Nicole meet?

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.790
Um, sort of a similar
romantic story.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.966
We were both
in the waiting area

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.220
of a dental office.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.320
Hmm! Hmm.

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.360
You remember how we met?

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.430
Art history class.

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.130
No, actually,
we met before that.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.200
Really?

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:11.170
Yeah.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.976
You were painting
on the pont des arts bridge.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.300
I pedaled past you,
you smiled, waved.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.810
I don't remember that.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.570
Yeah, that's the whole
reason I enrolled

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:21.210
in that art history class.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.740
How come you never
told me that?

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.950
Well, I am now.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.820
Mom!

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.120
Jp's coming to New York
for summer break!

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:31.590
Wow.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.150
I know, right?
And...

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.420
- There's more?
- Lots more.

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.560
Look what he gave me.

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:37.990
Don't be a ring...
- It's gonna be a ring...

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:39.930
A lock.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.660
We're putting it
on the bridge,

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.946
and I don't care
if they cut it off,

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.430
or melt it down...

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.470
It's ours.

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:50.170
Hello!

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:51.970
Mesdames et messieurs!

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:53.680
Thank you!

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.310
Thank you all
for joining me here today,

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:58.650
my friends, my colleagues.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.980
We have shared
many moments together,

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.920
some good, some not so good...

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:09.620
But, as the great
John w. Gardner said,

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.830
"life is the art of drawing
without the eraser."

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:18.430
Many of you have asked me
what defines my art...

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.500
What a question.
I can't answer.

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:25.770
Art is not what you see,

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:28.010
but what you make others see.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:33.150
So, eat, drink, enjoy the work,

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.980
and if you find something
you can't live without,

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.050
don't!

01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:46.190
You, uh, see anything

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:47.230
you can't live without?

01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:10.220
Hey.

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:15.820
So, um, are you
going to tell her?

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.729
What?

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.560
That you're still
in love with her.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.899
I couldn't help
but notice.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.399
No.

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:30.840
I'm not
going to tell her.

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:32.770
Jack...

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:35.740
We rarely get a second chance.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.410
Her life is there,

01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:38.510
my life is here.

01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:39.580
What...

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.550
What's the point?
She's leaving.

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.279
So you're just
going to bury your feelings?

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.550
Yeah.

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:46.020
It's been working for me so far.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.060
Has it?

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.890
Because in all the years
I've stayed at your hotel,

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:51.529
you've been alone.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.229
Or with a different girl

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.700
that you don't seem to care
all that much about.

01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:56.930
Kathryn!

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.569
Someone wants
to buy your portrait.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.770
Oh, dear.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.140
Have they had
too much champagne?

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:02.376
Well, I told them
it's not for sale,

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:03.416
but they want
to meet you anyway.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:04.410
Aw...

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:05.740
Pardon, Jack.

01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:20.990
Well, looks like
my plus-one

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.260
just turned into
a minus-one.

01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:24.990
Work.

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:29.260
Well, here's to the pluses
and the minuses.

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:36.439
Well, Hugo
should be happy.

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:38.340
Yeah, sold out.

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.340
I wish I could do that
at the hotel.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.910
Uh, you were sold out

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:43.640
the night
Trent checked in.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.410
Oh... right,
about that.

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.520
You gave him
that room on purpose.

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.250
What? No.
I would never...

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:51.520
Yes, you did!

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:52.819
All right, I'm sorry...

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:54.120
No, you're not.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.766
Hey, you know, that room
isn't even that small.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:57.020
It was a closet.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.990
I've stayed in rooms
way smaller than that.

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.660
- Seriously?
- Yeah!

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.360
You remember
my dorm room.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.270
Oh, yeah,
that was bad.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.500
Oh, remember
that poster you had

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:08.200
of the dogs
playing poker?

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.040
I still have it,
i love that poster.

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:13.710
That little bulldog?

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.940
That bulldog who's holding
the pocket Ace

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.510
in his little,
um... uh... hand?

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:20.620
Paw?

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.480
Foot? Whatever.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.020
That dog
can handle his cards.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.790
Oh, boy...

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:32.360
Here we go.

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:39.130
Oh... you, me, locks,

01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:41.070
and a bridge.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.200
I feel like
we've done this before.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.380
Too many locks,
not enough keys.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:51.350
You know, I didn't drop
that lock on purpose that day.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.020
I was scared.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:55.380
I know.

01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:01.090
I guess I could have jumped
on a plane to New York,

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.890
made some grand
romantic gesture.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:07.660
I waited too long.

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.100
We had our moment,
and I let it slip away.

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:12.470
We both did.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.610
I could gotten a job
at a hotel in New York.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.570
I could have
come here.

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:21.340
So, what stopped us?

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.320
Maybe that's all
we were supposed to be.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.620
Thank you for a nice night.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.706
Hey, you wouldn't
happen to be hungry

01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:38.860
by any chance?

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:39.890
Starving.

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:41.360
Ah. Come on,
follow me.

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:45.700
Hey, you still throwing pasta
up on the ceiling?

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:47.540
Of course. You?

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:48.576
That's the only way
to know if it's done.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.810
Nice to know
some things never change.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.240
Well, change
is good, right?

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.240
Eh...

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.050
Doesn't really sound
like a ringing endorsement.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.380
I guess I'm scared.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.120
Of what?

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:08.260
Losing control of everything.

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:10.460
You know, I'm saying goodbye
to Alexa.

01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:12.260
If I say goodbye
to my business,

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:13.390
what do I have left?

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800
Yourself?

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.600
Okay, so if someone
wanted to buy your hotel,

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.270
would you sell it?

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:26.070
Well... that would depend
on how much they were offering.

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:28.840
You know, I could always
start a new hotel.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.310
So much for
that commitment.

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:31.580
No, come on.

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.580
Lindsey, these are
things, okay?

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.420
Things... things
can be replaced.

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:37.350
People can't.

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:40.990
Yeah, but what if
that thing is who you are?

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.390
This isn't who you are.

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:45.690
You hardly know me
anymore, Jack.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:47.160
Uh... I think I do.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.100
You're that girl
on the bridge

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:51.630
with her paintbox
and big dreams.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.476
Yeah, well, all that's left
of that dream

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.200
is a magazine
about other people's art.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.440
It sounds like
you've got to learn to let go.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:00.610
All right?

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.540
If you can't let go,

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.310
then you'll never get
to the other side.

01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:05.610
Trust me, I should know.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:21.960
This is nice.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.830
Yeah.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.960
Anytime.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.170
There you are.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.570
Oh.

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:32.170
How was your meeting?

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:33.250
It was good,
it was good...

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.810
I'm sorry I missed the show,

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.640
and I was hoping
to take you to dinner,

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.480
but I see that
I'm a little late.

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.010
Oh, yeah, this was...

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:41.650
This was just kind of
spur of the moment.

01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:47.090
Listen, uh,
on the bright side,

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.760
I switched you
to another room.

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:51.360
Oh, good.
Uh, smaller, right?

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:52.660
No, no, uh...

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:53.860
A suite,

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:55.530
compliments of the owner.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.700
I appreciate that,
thank you.

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:59.400
Um, Jack...
Is the bar open?

01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:00.700
Absolutely.

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.370
As soon as
i put on an apron.

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:05.340
Great.

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:13.880
We can turn <i>pov</i>

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.050
into something
bigger and better,

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.250
and isn't that what you wanted
when you started it?

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:20.620
Uh, I'm pretty sure
when I started,

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.420
all I wanted was
to pay the rent.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.230
That won't be
a problem anymore.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.260
And my staff?

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:26.960
I can take
some of them on.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.100
How about all of them?

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.530
Do you have an office dog
you want us take on as well?

01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:33.700
No, but there's a pigeon
that lives on the window ledge.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.140
Hmm. All right, pigeon gets
a corner office,

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:38.040
but that's
as far as I go.

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:41.080
Does anyone
ever say no to you?

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:42.580
Mm...

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:44.750
That's great.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.650
You, actually,
still have not said yes.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.820
Now, Lindsey,
i get it.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:52.720
I mean, this magazine
is your baby.

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:54.990
Yeah, well...

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.890
Babies grow up, right?

01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:59.590
They leave the nest
and fly away,

01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:00.830
and maybe...

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.400
Maybe it's time for me
to say goodbye.

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:04.870
Is that a yes?

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.300
That's...

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.670
That's a yes.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.740
I'm in.

01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:12.170
Congratulations.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.286
I am so thrilled,
that's wonderful.

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:15.410
Thank you.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.626
Sorry, couldn't help
but overhear.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.610
Congratulations.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.280
Thank you.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:20.610
Well, thank you
very much, Jack,

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:21.480
and I say,

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.780
we go and celebrate.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:23.920
Now?

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:25.650
Mm-hmm. Top
of the Eiffel Tower.

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:26.990
I made us a reservation

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.520
on the chance
you would say yes.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.420
Well, once again,
sorry to interrupt,

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.330
but the Eiffel Tower
is gonna be closed.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.630
Not tonight
it's not.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.700
Ah, you must have friends
in high places.

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:37.260
Thankfully I do.
So...?

01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:40.530
You know, if you don't mind,

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.470
I think I'll go for a walk.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.670
I've got a lot to think about.

01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:45.940
Sure,
that's probably...

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:47.480
Sure.
A good idea.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.180
Goodnight.
And goodnight.

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:50.480
Goodnight.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.520
Sorry to call you
so late.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.660
Is everything
all right?

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.330
Well, I hope so.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.640
You found it.

01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:19.210
Oh...

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.810
I never thought
I'd see it again.

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.450
Thank you.

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:41.160
Oh, you're up.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.200
And...

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:45.370
I want details.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.740
Starting with the moment
i saw you leave the gallery,

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.170
with Jack.

01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:51.140
Uh...

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:53.340
Do I interrogate you
when you come in late?

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.180
Are you kidding?

01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:01.720
We walked, we talked, we ate,

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.650
Trent showed up, and...

01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:06.890
I decided to sell the magazine.

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.920
What?

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.960
Mom, are you sure?

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:18.000
I've been trying to keep
everything the same,

01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:20.670
you, our life.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.400
But things change.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.170
They grow up,

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:28.240
and that's okay.

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:34.920
I'm proud of you.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.580
It's going to be great.

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:37.690
I know it.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.320
Thanks, sweetie.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.460
Wow...

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.090
Look at you.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.790
A few days ago, you were
in the lonely apartment,

01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:48.100
hiding art in the closet,

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:51.370
and now you are in Paris,

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.970
with two men half
in love with you.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.770
No one's in love with me,

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.000
not even half in love with me.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:57.570
Jack is.

01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:01.340
That's ridiculous.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.010
Is it?

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.780
Oh, you've been in Paris
four days,

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:06.350
and you're an expert on love?

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.350
I'm an expert on you.

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:21.730
I was hoping
to see you

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.030
before I left.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.800
Look...

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:27.300
You found it!

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.400
Hugo did.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.170
After the show,

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.470
he went back
with a flashlight

01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:31.410
and searched for hours.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.670
I'm so glad.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.510
You know, I thought I'd be sad
if I saw it again,

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:40.050
but it's just the opposite.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.850
It reminds me of how happy
James and I were

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.420
on that bridge.

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:44.520
I found something

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:45.596
I thought was lost forever.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.050
Hope.

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.590
He was the love of my life,

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.690
and I know he'd want me
to find love again.

01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:52.760
I'm sure he would.

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:55.130
And you should, too, my dear.

01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:01.500
Is he what you're looking for?

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.010
Or is he
just an excuse

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.386
to avoid what's really
in your heart?

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:08.710
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.410
I think you do.

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:15.620
If you loved someone enough
to keep away from Paris,

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.920
then nothing should
keep you from that love.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.960
Oh, my goodness,
listen to me...

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:26.530
One rusted lock,
and I'm giving out advice.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.360
It just goes by so quickly.

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.130
Paris?

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.900
Life.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.700
Hi!

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.910
I just wanted
to say goodbye!

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.740
I have a feeling you'll be
seeing a lot more of her here.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:42.786
Yes, well, it's just
a train ride away,

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:44.140
and I do love the train.

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:47.480
When I come back, I'd love
to see all your paintings.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.556
I'll give you
a private showing.

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.480
Brilliant.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.320
And when do you leave?

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.220
Tonight.

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.396
Well, you'll have to let me
know how it all turns out.

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.820
Oh, I'm sure Hugo will be
giving you every last detail.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.330
I'm counting on it.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.230
I'm so glad
we're doing this.

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.930
One last walk.

01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:06.570
Don't say
"one last walk."

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.840
Did I say "last"?

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:10.770
I meant, "first walk
of the last day."

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:12.340
You've come
a long way, mom.

01:20:12.370 --> 01:20:14.070
We've come a long way.

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:16.310
Oh, look at
all this love!

01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.426
I wonder how many
of these people

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:19.280
are actually
still together.

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:20.510
All of them.

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:21.820
In some way.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:25.750
That's not what you said
last time.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.490
Well, maybe I'm less
un-romantic than I thought.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.190
"Less un-romantic."

01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:35.100
Double-negative.

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:37.930
You do realize that means...
Romantic.

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:42.440
You're supposed
to fall in love in Paris.

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.370
Okay, uh, let's hit the louvre.

01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:47.310
Or, um...

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:48.510
We'll take a selfie

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.440
at the clock tower
at the sorbonne,

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.956
unless you did that
last time you were here.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.280
"Selfie?"

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:53.550
We didn't have
selfies.

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.150
We didn't have phones.

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.050
You're old.

01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:02.720
Don't worry,
I'll be with her every day.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.560
Not helping, jp.

01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:05.906
I just mean
i will look after her.

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:07.630
Thank you.

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.800
That means a lot.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.300
I'll leave you two
to say goodbye.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.940
- Bon voyage.
- A la prochaine.

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.510
I like him.

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:25.810
I love him.

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:27.210
I know.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.820
You're not going
to talk me out of it?

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:31.550
I couldn't anyway.

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:32.590
And no.

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:35.990
This whole trip,
it's been...

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.260
So much fun.

01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:38.860
You sure you don't
want me to stay

01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:40.330
and help you
set up your room?

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.100
Did I hear a helicopter?

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.730
I'll make your bed
with hospital corners.

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:46.600
I appreciate that,
but, um...

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:49.040
It's time for me
to make my own bed.

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.700
Now, go. You have
just enough time

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.670
to say bye to Hugo
before your flight.

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:53.870
I love you.

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.510
I love you, too, sweetie.

01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:58.550
I'll talk to you
tomorrow.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.510
Mom...

01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:01.150
Did I say tomorrow?
I meant the next day.

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:04.690
Hi!

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.530
Hugo!

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.690
Mm? Good!

01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:15.900
I thought you sold out.

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.130
Well, I always keep
a few of my favorites,

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:20.370
you know that.

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:25.210
Your best work.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.270
So far.

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:30.140
You really do
always say that.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:32.650
Well, this time,
it might even be true.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.150
What do you think will happen
when all the locks come off?

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.750
Well, people
always find a way

01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:39.750
to show love.

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:43.920
You know, music, art.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.490
Maybe even
the ineloquent words

01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:48.460
of a sappy teenager,

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.600
or an aging artist, or...

01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:54.940
A hotel owner.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.670
Want me to ship it to you?

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.840
Keep it here.

01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:59.016
Good, I was hoping
you'd say that.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.070
I have a special place for it.

01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:03.410
Good, then I'll see it
when I come back.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.750
I'll count the days.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.110
Me too.

01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:07.510
I'm going
to miss you, Hugo.

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:09.520
I know.

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:10.650
Take care of my girl.

01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:12.520
Oh, she will do fine.

01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:15.060
You did.

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:19.330
There we go.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.230
Great.

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.706
Well, thank you again
for the upgrade.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.200
Don't mention it.

01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:25.170
And I'll be sure
to recommend the hotel

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.230
to all my associates.

01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:28.046
And we will be sure to put
all of your magazines

01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:29.200
in our lobby.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.646
Oh, you'll need
a bigger lobby for that.

01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:33.940
Hey, good luck
with everything.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.510
Yeah, you too.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.950
Oh.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.050
Yup.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.150
Oh, hold on one sec.
There she is.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:43.150
I'll see you
when I'm back in New York.

01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:44.650
- Great.
- Bye-bye.

01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:45.450
I'll see you then.

01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:46.490
Bye.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:49.790
So...

01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:53.230
This is it, I guess.

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.000
Yeah, I guess, uh...

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.900
I guess it is.

01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:58.670
Um, Lindsey, I got you
a little something

01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.730
before you go.

01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:01.440
You shouldn't have.

01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:08.040
I've been holding
onto it long enough,

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.680
and now it's your turn.

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:11.710
You kept it?

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:14.450
I always thought it'd be
worth something someday.

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:18.590
Um...

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.860
Listen, Lindsey...

01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:25.190
I...

01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:26.760
I just wanted to say that...

01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:28.400
I'm...

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.260
I'm in...

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:30.660
Jack!

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.130
It's starting to snow.

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:36.200
I heard you were leaving.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.040
Yes.

01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:40.110
Do come back
and visit us someday.

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.910
I will.

01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:46.810
Goodbye, Jack.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.680
Goodbye, Lindsey.

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.170
And... I'm back.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.990
Five-letter word
for "Valentine..."

01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:08.260
"Cupid."

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:32.190
Nine-letter word
for "heartbreak..."

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.120
"Artichoke."

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.320
You're back!

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.190
I'm back!

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.900
And I brought you
chocolate and perfume.

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.400
Hmm, not a boyfriend?

01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:17.200
Sorry.

01:27:17.230 --> 01:27:18.230
Hi!

01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:19.230
How's Alexa?

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:20.370
Are you sad?

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.070
Actually, I'm okay.

01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.240
So there's a cure
for empty nest syndrome.

01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:27.210
There's no cure,
but there is Skype.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.510
Hey, guys.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:31.480
So, you really
said yes to Trent.

01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:33.410
I really did,

01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:36.750
and if you want to stay on
with the magazine, you can.

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.050
Are you kidding me?

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.820
I can't believe
I'm going to be working

01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:40.890
with the hottest guy
on the planet.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.490
Because that is the most
important thing.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.430
I'm sure I'll get tired
of looking at him,

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.560
after 10 or 20 years.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:02.740
He's here.

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.010
Send him in.

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:13.590
Hey...

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:15.260
Hey, you.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.290
Come here.

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:21.960
Wow, so...

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.030
You ready for all this?

01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:25.470
About that...

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.770
What, you didn't
change your mind, did you?

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.870
No, the magazine's
still yours,

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.270
to make bigger and better.

01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:32.410
Great.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.440
It's just...

01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:35.140
I'm not staying on.

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.540
What?

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:37.880
What? Why?
What happened?

01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:40.450
Paris, I guess.

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.380
The truth is,

01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:44.720
I started an art magazine

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:48.390
because I wasn't brave enough
to be an artist.

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.560
Whoa...

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:53.430
I've never really admitted that
out loud before. Um...

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:56.430
I... I want to paint again.

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:59.800
And I know I may not
be good enough.

01:28:59.830 --> 01:29:01.270
Maybe I'll just end up
with a cat

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.640
sketching people in the park,

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.510
but at least I'll have tried.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.670
Paint?

01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:08.140
Yeah.

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.510
You're sure about all this?

01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:10.440
No.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.450
No.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.010
But I'm doing it anyway.

01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:15.820
So I get the magazine, but...

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:16.850
But not you.

01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:19.950
I'm sorry.

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:22.660
Yeah, me too.

01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:26.330
I guess someone
can say no to me.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.500
I doubt it'll ever
happen again.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.260
Yeah.

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:31.770
Okay. All right.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.300
Wow.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:38.140
Um, you should probably
have your lawyers

01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:40.510
check that out,

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.610
and, uh...

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.810
That'll be that.

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.220
Goodbye, Lindsey.

01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:51.250
Goodbye.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:58.360
All right.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:38.260
Hey, Nicole,
can I come see you?

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.500
We need to talk.

01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:42.640
About us.

01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:47.710
<i>Tell me you're not alone
on Valentine's day.</i>

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:50.840
Valentine's day...

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.880
Is that today?

01:30:53.050 --> 01:30:55.850
<i>Mom, jp and I put our lock
on the bridge today.</i>

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.620
<i>It was beautiful,</i>

01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:00.190
<i>and I don't care
if they cut it off.</i>

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.520
People will always find a way
to show their love.

01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:07.390
'Lex? Uh,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:08.606
Have fun with jp tonight, okay?

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:10.300
Happy valentines day.
I love you.

01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:11.560
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.940
Jack?

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.250
Hey.

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.410
Uh, happy Valentine's day.

01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:27.980
What are you doing here?

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:28.880
This is, uh...

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.980
This is a grand romantic
gesture gone awry.

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:31.890
It's freezing!

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.590
Get inside!

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.160
Okay... okay, yeah...

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:36.160
Okay, I got it.

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:39.530
Okay. Okay...

01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:43.160
I thought...

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.276
I thought you were
going to notice me

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.430
a lot sooner than that.

01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:46.670
Wow...

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:49.140
No one does romance
quite like you.

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:51.140
No one does romance
quite like us.

01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:54.240
Business flowers?

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.810
These are definitely not
business flowers.

01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:59.510
Okay, I...

01:31:59.550 --> 01:32:02.750
I should have come
to follow you 20 years ago,

01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:04.650
I should have come to follow you
two days ago.

01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:09.660
But I'm here now.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.830
And I'm asking
for another chance.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.430
I think something
can be arranged.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.650
Now, that's
your best work.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.980
Hugo... you always
say that.

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.620
Hey!

01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:38.826
We're heading back to campus,
do you wanna grab lunch first?

01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:39.820
Oh, thanks, sweetie,

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:41.036
but I think I'm going to stay
and finish this.

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:43.490
Have fun.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.620
Beautiful, madame.

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:46.360
Thank you, jp.

01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:47.330
I'll see you Monday?

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.700
Tango Monday.

01:32:51.930 --> 01:32:53.070
Young love.

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.030
Nothing like it.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.670
Well, old love's not so bad.

01:32:57.710 --> 01:33:00.010
Hey, will you
close up for me?

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.040
I have to meet
Kathryn for tea.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.140
Tea?

01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.310
Well, she's having tea,
I'm having everything but.

01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:07.410
Uh... Rouge.

01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:10.880
More red
on the bridge, hmm?

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.890
Salut.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.750
Salut.

01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.370
This looks familiar.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.870
Yes, it does.

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.780
Shall we try this again?

01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:42.120
Yes, and this time,
i brought extra locks.

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:43.950
How many?

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:45.290
Lots.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.390
Good.

01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:51.620
All right,
this is it.

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.130
Any last words?

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.360
Just those three.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.530
"Ooh la la"?

01:34:00.570 --> 01:34:03.370
Uh, no.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:06.310
I was thinking...

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.910
"I love you."

01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:13.850
I love you, too.

01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:27.490
Well, it may have
taken us a while...

01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:29.500
But we got here.

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:30.930
We did.
