04:01.800 --> 04:03.599
We're not turning
around. He's gone!

04:03.600 --> 04:04.759
What do you mean, "He's gone"?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.959
He was still moving.
I fucking saw him still moving.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.599
We killed people!

04:08.600 --> 04:10.399
What do you mean? Turn
the fucking car around!

04:10.400 --> 04:12.559
He's gone! What are
we supposed to do?

04:12.560 --> 04:15.039
Damn it, this shit's not worth
it for me to leave him there!

04:15.040 --> 04:16.639
We killed people, man.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.478
God damn it! Please, I'm begging
you. He's my fucking brother.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.759
I said this would happen.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.319
Fuck you, Archie!

04:22.320 --> 04:23.479
Fuck you!

04:23.480 --> 04:25.359
You can't go anywhere
without your brother.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.199
And I very almost got
my head blown off,

04:27.200 --> 04:30.159
because he's a fucking baby
who can't look after himself.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.879
- Fuck you!
- Sit still!

04:32.880 --> 04:34.581
God damn it!

04:35.200 --> 04:38.399
So then, now, look
what happens to him.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.119
Can't be feeling
responsible for that.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.279
If he was a man who
could look after himself,

04:43.280 --> 04:44.959
he'd be accepting it right now.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.079
Fuck you. Say that again.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.679
You heard me. You know it.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.319
Fuck you, Archie! Say that again!

04:49.320 --> 04:51.519
If he was a man, he
wouldn't be crying about it,

04:51.520 --> 04:52.599
he'd be accepting it.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.599
Say that one more goddamn time.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.679
I said it twice.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.319
One more goddamn time, Archie.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.639
If I said it again, I'd say
it the exact same way,

04:59.640 --> 05:01.319
and that'd be three
times I said it!

05:38.880 --> 05:40.639
Fuck!

06:38.120 --> 06:41.439
Let's go. Come on,
come on, come on.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.301
Come on!

08:28.680 --> 08:30.381
Who's this?

08:34.640 --> 08:37.991
- That's our truck, man.
- What?

09:00.800 --> 09:01.919
What the fuck's he doing?

09:01.920 --> 09:03.621
Jesus, fuck!

09:39.640 --> 09:41.671
Fuck!

09:52.480 --> 09:55.023
Fuck!

09:57.760 --> 09:59.461
Fuck!

10:14.240 --> 10:18.262
- Is he giving up?
- He ain't giving up.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.439
What's he doing?

10:21.440 --> 10:24.268
What's he doing?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.862
He's gonna keep following us, man.

10:35.280 --> 10:39.119
Okay, okay, okay.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.586
Fuck you. Fuck you.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.271
He's moving.

12:05.120 --> 12:09.461
What's going on with you, brother?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.465
I said what's going on, brother?

12:16.280 --> 12:19.039
I want my car back.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.151
Yeah, I can see that.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.150
You ain't gettin' it back.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.945
I want my car back.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.199
If you don't give it to me now,

12:28.200 --> 12:32.347
I'm gonna get back in that truck and
I'm gonna stay on you till you do.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.719
What makes you think I
won't kill you right here?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.421
Huh?

12:39.480 --> 12:42.639
Nothing makes me think that.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.990
Come on, just for a little...

13:55.840 --> 13:58.588
<i>Area one, all clear. Over.</i>

17:22.720 --> 17:25.262
Do you need anything?

17:27.000 --> 17:31.119
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three people in it.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.759
It hasn't stopped here.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.079
They needed petrol.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.199
I haven't got any petrol.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.519
Did you see it?

17:41.520 --> 17:45.399
I haven't seen a car with three people
in it. Do you want to buy something?

17:45.400 --> 17:49.661
I've got tins of stuff and some
auto accessories and other things.

18:48.840 --> 18:53.079
I'm looking for a car
with three people in it.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.679
Have you seen it?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.399
No.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.919
Anyone else seen it?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.919
I don't know.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.839
Who would know?

19:02.840 --> 19:04.519
Maybe Grandma.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.039
Where's Grandma?

19:07.040 --> 19:10.027
Down there.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.399
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three men in it.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.751
Did it come through here?

19:41.760 --> 19:43.879
What's your name?

19:43.880 --> 19:46.799
Have you seen it?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.581
What's your name?

19:50.600 --> 19:53.239
Have you seen it?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.908
Do you want something?

19:57.040 --> 20:00.519
Do you want to sleep with a boy?

20:00.520 --> 20:02.870
I've got a boy here
you can sleep with.

20:04.680 --> 20:09.066
He's smooth like the
inside of your arm.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.825
Stop fucking whispering.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.671
I need to buy a gun.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.639
Stop fucking whispering.
I'll fucking kill ya.

20:52.640 --> 20:56.583
- You understand?
- I need a gun.

20:58.720 --> 20:59.999
Fuck!

21:00.000 --> 21:03.599
Fuck this shit!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.782
Fucking son of a bitch.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.879
Shut up!

21:34.320 --> 21:37.227
God, no.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.025
No...

21:52.000 --> 21:53.759
Have you got guns?

21:53.760 --> 21:56.667
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

21:57.240 --> 22:00.261
I heard you. I heard what you need.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.107
Fucking psycho.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.149
Careful.

22:11.040 --> 22:15.399
They're 30 each. That
one's 300. That one's 300.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.279
And that one's 300.
I only take US dollars.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.199
I don't have 300.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.839
They're $300 US.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.999
Can you do this one for less?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.239
I told you how much they cost.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.599
I don't have $300 US.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.268
They're 300. You don't have
300, you can fuck off.

23:19.640 --> 23:23.822
I'm looking for my car.
Have you seen it?

23:24.080 --> 23:26.279
Tell me your name.
I want to know your name.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.399
- Answer my question.
- Answer mine.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.919
Answer my question.
I'm not gonna say it again.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.906
Okay.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.639
I'll call you "my baby."

23:38.640 --> 23:40.944
My baby.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.626
There was a car

23:44.280 --> 23:49.959
and it had three men in it and
it did what most cars do.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.822
It came in one direction
and left in the other.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.479
That's all I can tell you about it.

23:57.480 --> 24:03.799
The only detail I can tell you is the
detail that pertains to this place.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.559
I can tell you what they drank.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.308
I can tell you what
they smelled like.

24:09.400 --> 24:13.991
I can tell you what they
said, if they said anything

24:14.200 --> 24:17.479
and if I heard what it
was that they said.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.148
What did they say?

24:20.840 --> 24:24.749
They didn't say anything.
They didn't stop here.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.119
You must really love
that car, darling.

24:32.120 --> 24:37.348
What a thing to get worked
up about in this day and age.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.790
What is it about the car
that you love so much?

24:46.800 --> 24:50.424
Can you tell me?

24:53.080 --> 24:55.908
What's your name, sweetheart?

25:04.040 --> 25:06.230
Oh, don't be silly.

25:06.320 --> 25:10.502
Now you're just being rude.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.862
What are you doing with this car?

25:52.560 --> 25:54.599
It's my brother's car.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.109
Who's your brother?

25:59.080 --> 26:01.020
Where is he?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.544
Where's Henry at?

26:03.920 --> 26:06.987
Who's your brother? Where is he?

26:09.800 --> 26:13.199
You tell me where he is,
or I'm gonna kill you.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.902
Where is he?

26:22.640 --> 26:24.439
There's no doctor here.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.079
I'm about the most useful
person in this town.

26:27.080 --> 26:30.999
If that gives you any idea how far
from having a doctor this town is.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.319
Is there a doctor somewhere else?

26:33.320 --> 26:35.319
Buy something.

26:35.320 --> 26:40.159
I told you what I've got. I've got
tins of things and drinks and stuff.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.399
I have to deal with
this shit all day.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.639
Please.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.359
I'm not joking.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.439
You can say "please" all you
like, but I'm not joking.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.667
Now, pick yourself
something off the shelf.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.148
Pay Benny.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.639
There's a doctor in them
hills there. Head east,

27:18.640 --> 27:22.479
and follow the road that looks like it
leads to those hills, you'll get there.

27:22.480 --> 27:26.502
It's got a big yellow fridge out the
front, says "Peeples" written on it.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.719
Pull the gun out of your pants.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.679
I've got a kid in the
car who needs help.

28:57.680 --> 29:01.862
Pull the gun out of your pants
and put it on the ground.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.706
He needs help.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.341
Is this man your friend?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.999
How much do you want
for doing this?

30:01.000 --> 30:04.749
I don't want your money.

30:05.080 --> 30:10.911
I've gotten pretty good
living without money.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.679
I have to keep these guys locked
up in here now for the most part,

32:34.680 --> 32:39.146
'cause people take them for food.

32:48.520 --> 32:51.959
These guys came to me.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.359
People just drop them off

32:53.360 --> 32:57.119
and ask me to look after them
while they went away somewhere

32:57.120 --> 33:02.399
or because they had to go
somewhere or do something,

33:02.400 --> 33:06.821
and none of them ever came back.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.591
I guess they've gone
looking for money.

33:29.120 --> 33:35.304
Do you want me to take
a look at your cuts?

33:41.080 --> 33:44.386
No.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.068
Hey.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.742
How ya going?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.460
I'm well.

34:38.199 --> 34:44.748
Um, do you wanna take a chair
while I have a look at you?

35:00.400 --> 35:03.023
It hurts.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.479
Do you want to take your hand away?

35:06.480 --> 35:10.662
That doesn't look too bad.

35:11.320 --> 35:16.901
That looks good. You just
need to keep this clean.

35:27.880 --> 35:32.221
Tell me where your brother is.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.865
I'll take you to him.

35:38.240 --> 35:41.386
Tell me where your brother is.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.141
Mmm.

35:45.520 --> 35:49.747
He's gone south a long way from here.
I'll take you to him, I promise.

35:50.720 --> 35:55.061
I'm just gonna get you a T-shirt.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.071
Get up. We're leaving.

36:02.040 --> 36:06.631
Maybe we should ask
what the lady says.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.559
Get up.

36:21.120 --> 36:24.559
- What was that sound?
- It's a car coming.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.759
What car?

36:25.760 --> 36:27.959
I don't know.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.239
That's two cars.

36:32.240 --> 36:36.919
- How long till they're here?
- A minute, maybe.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.119
Who is it?

36:38.120 --> 36:40.519
Get your rifle.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.268
- Do you know them?
- Go and get your rifle.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.304
Tell me what's going on.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.670
Who are these people?

37:54.520 --> 37:56.426
Get up. We're leaving.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.031
Get up.

39:31.720 --> 39:35.469
Where are we?

39:51.040 --> 39:53.947
I'm hungry.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.907
Go and get some food?

40:53.160 --> 40:56.227
You're gonna start talking to me.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.399
What?

40:58.400 --> 41:02.786
Don't fucking "what" me.
Where are we going?

41:04.640 --> 41:06.999
I can't tell you nothing more
than I already told you.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.999
I don't give a shit what you
think you've already told me.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.719
Start fucking talking to me!

41:10.720 --> 41:12.799
Don't.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.919
Do you even know where we are?

41:14.920 --> 41:17.679
- What?
- Where are we?

41:17.680 --> 41:18.959
Where are we?

41:18.960 --> 41:20.359
I don't know.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.079
You don't fucking know?

41:22.080 --> 41:23.679
So, how are you gonna
get to where you're going

41:23.680 --> 41:27.384
if you don't know where
the fuck you are?

41:37.800 --> 41:42.585
Do you even understand
what I just said, half-wit?

41:46.800 --> 41:51.027
We're going to Carloon.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.799
We're going to Carloon.

43:21.480 --> 43:24.519
I just asked that lady how
to get to Carloon from here.

43:24.520 --> 43:29.639
I was gonna do that anyway
and you would've heard me

43:29.640 --> 43:35.039
and you would've asked her what I
said, figured out what I said anyway.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.027
I was gonna tell you anyway.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.783
You wanna know so bad.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.359
But you don't know exactly where
in Carloon we're going exactly,

43:48.360 --> 43:52.542
so, I'm still in control here.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.279
You don't know exactly where
in Carloon we're going,

43:58.280 --> 44:00.709
so you got to take me with you.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.799
I'm taking you with me
because if I get to Carloon

44:06.800 --> 44:09.901
and your brother's not there,
I'm gonna slit your throat.

44:18.840 --> 44:23.670
What you want with my
brother so bad, hmm?

44:25.360 --> 44:28.666
Who are you?

44:31.000 --> 44:35.199
I'm Rey. Is that what you mean?

44:35.200 --> 44:38.380
Why are you here?

44:43.040 --> 44:47.439
Me and my brother came out for
the mines. Like everybody else.

44:47.440 --> 44:51.462
Why's your brother in Carloon?

44:52.040 --> 44:54.559
That's where he was gonna go.

44:54.560 --> 44:58.787
Why are you here and your
brother's in Carloon?

45:02.240 --> 45:06.023
They had to get going
in a big hurry.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.984
Why?

45:11.240 --> 45:15.911
Why did he have to get
going in a big hurry?

45:18.600 --> 45:22.463
I don't know.
I can't talk about it.

45:22.920 --> 45:27.944
Why did your brother have to
get to Carloon in a big hurry?

45:31.440 --> 45:33.710
I can't talk about it.

45:34.200 --> 45:35.599
Well, whatever it was he did,

45:35.600 --> 45:39.383
you got left here to die
while he was doing it.

45:40.680 --> 45:44.559
- It didn't happen like that.
- Really?

45:44.560 --> 45:47.991
How did it happen, then?

45:51.080 --> 45:55.910
I can't talk about it no more,
just stop asking about everything.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.799
'Cause I believe in God and I
know Henry believes in God,

46:01.800 --> 46:04.519
and there's no harm Henry
would want to see me come to.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.143
I believe in that.

46:07.600 --> 46:12.146
Yet look at the harm you've
come to and where's Henry?

46:16.240 --> 46:18.399
He's waiting for me.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.341
He's not waiting for you.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.839
Yes, he is.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.144
No, he's not.

46:28.480 --> 46:31.990
I'll tell you what God's given you.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.782
He's put a bullet in you.

46:36.200 --> 46:40.871
And he's abandoned you out here
to me, who feels nothing for you.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.679
I couldn't give a fuck
if you die tomorrow.

46:46.680 --> 46:49.639
God gave you a brother
who's not waiting for you.

46:49.640 --> 46:54.425
He gave you a brother who's not
even thinking about you right now.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.750
Just because you and him came
out of the same woman's hole.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.679
The only thing that means
anything right now

47:06.680 --> 47:10.862
is that I'm here and he's not.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.639
Your brother left you to die.

47:18.640 --> 47:21.468
That's what people do.

47:23.120 --> 47:28.382
You don't learn to fight, your
death's gonna come real soon.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.199
<i>This is 5-1. Passage
is called 2-11.</i>

49:18.200 --> 49:20.902
<i>We should be clear
or clearing shortly.</i>

52:09.400 --> 52:11.679
4-3-7 Echo.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.639
4-3-7 Echo. This is K-K.
Do you copy?

52:21.040 --> 52:23.265
Stop shooting!

52:33.320 --> 52:35.909
I just wanted to fight.

52:36.600 --> 52:39.382
I just wanted to fight him.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.866
Let's go.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.346
Come on.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.879
<i>That lady said it would take about eight
hours to get there, in the old days.</i>

55:53.880 --> 55:57.999
<i>But it might take longer now 'cause a lot
of them old roads ain't there no more.</i>

55:58.000 --> 56:02.466
And all the roads are bad now anyways
so you can't drive fast on 'em.

56:08.800 --> 56:11.599
She said about eight or nine hours.

56:11.600 --> 56:14.079
She wasn't sure if it
was eight or nine.

56:14.080 --> 56:17.306
She seemed a bit confused about it.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.466
And why would he still be there?

56:22.960 --> 56:26.311
He had to wait two
weeks for someone.

56:26.320 --> 56:30.991
There's a man there he's got to
meet, it's gonna take two weeks.

56:31.520 --> 56:34.063
You know this? Or this
is what he told you?

56:35.120 --> 56:36.821
Huh?

56:38.640 --> 56:40.039
Your brother can't be trusted.

56:40.040 --> 56:44.825
Is this something that you know or
is this something that he told you?

56:51.120 --> 56:53.504
Both those things.

57:05.600 --> 57:08.189
You work in the mines?

57:09.120 --> 57:10.821
No.

57:12.880 --> 57:15.344
What do you do then?

57:18.640 --> 57:21.786
I was a farmer. And now I'm here.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.439
Then how come you learned
how to shoot so good?

57:28.440 --> 57:30.551
You was in the army?

57:43.200 --> 57:46.519
When I was a little kid
I grew up on a farm.

57:46.520 --> 57:50.959
We had these neighbors, real old
man and lady, Verna and Clarry,

57:50.960 --> 57:53.071
they's brother and sister.

57:53.640 --> 57:56.279
And they lived on this
land that's all overgrown,

57:56.280 --> 58:00.541
like you couldn't even tell what
they farmed, so overgrown.

58:01.680 --> 58:05.039
And Clarry had these eight tractors,
and none of them worked properly,

58:05.040 --> 58:09.559
so every morning he'd roll each one down
the hill till he got one of them started

58:09.560 --> 58:13.182
and then use that one to
tow all the others back up.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.029
He did that every day.

58:18.200 --> 58:20.719
And when they died, their family,
who we'd never met before,

58:20.720 --> 58:23.946
came around, cleared
out their house

58:24.680 --> 58:27.199
and they found all this...

58:27.200 --> 58:30.744
They found all this
weird stuff in there.

58:31.760 --> 58:33.666
Like...

58:35.000 --> 58:37.304
Like 50 therm...

58:40.560 --> 58:43.228
Thermionic radio valves.

58:43.720 --> 58:47.583
Like them real old valves
they used in old radios.

58:48.480 --> 58:51.421
And pyramid of pumpkins.

58:52.120 --> 58:56.479
And about 5,000 of these
little sticks about this long.

58:56.480 --> 59:02.949
And each wrapped up in newspaper and
tied up at the ends with baling twine.

59:09.560 --> 59:12.388
Why are you telling me this?

59:14.840 --> 59:17.349
I just remembered it.

59:17.600 --> 59:20.143
It interested me.

59:23.600 --> 59:27.144
Not everything has to
be about something.

59:49.640 --> 59:54.743
I'm tryin' to stop thinking about
that little girl who died, but I can't.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.225
You shouldn't.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.105
But I can't.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.345
You shouldn't stop
thinking about her.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.919
You should never stop thinking
about a life you've taken.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.191
It's the price you
pay for taking it.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.599
That's it, sweetheart.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.302
Let's start with the eyelids.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.559
I want you to roll over onto your
front, put your hands behind your back.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.830
And do it slow.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.665
And do it now.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.230
<i>When are you gonna
say something, cunt?</i>

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.945
<i>It's over.</i>

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.710
It's over for you.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.905
I know that.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.981
That's good that you know that.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.239
Do you know it, too?

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.999
Oh, I know it, champ.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.190
I told you it.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.866
Do you know it's over for you, too?

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.239
Whatever you think's over for
me was over a long time ago.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.479
I'm asking about you.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.279
Are you threatening me?

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.027
No.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.262
A threat means there's still
something left to happen.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.541
What are you gonna do with me?

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.429
You're going to Sydney.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.548
Why don't you just shoot me?

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.629
Why don't you do it?

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.980
That's what everyone else is doing.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.039
Because me sending you to Sydney

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.745
tells Sydney there's a reason to
keep paying us what they pay us.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.799
If we just shot every
idiot we wanted to shoot,

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:44.062
then pretty soon they'd start to wonder
what the fuck we're doing out here.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.759
See, personally
I don't care about you.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.679
I don't care if you get to Sydney and they
let you off or you bribe your way out

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.799
or whatever the fuck they
do down there these days.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.229
I don't give a fuck.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.223
I'm doing this for me.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.348
You're doing what for you?

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.428
You're doing what for you?

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.549
I murdered my wife.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.359
I followed her to a man's house,

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.159
I watched him put his fingers
inside her and I killed 'em both.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.908
No one ever came after me.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.230
Ten years ago.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.341
I never had to explain myself.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.519
I never had to lie to anyone.
I never had to run and hide.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.239
I just buried 'em in a
hole and I went home.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.988
No one ever came after me.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.588
And that hurt me more than
getting my heart broken.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.542
Knowing it didn't matter.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.470
Knowing you can do something like
that and no one comes after you.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.946
You do a thing like I did, that
should really mean something.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.260
But it just doesn't matter anymore.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.825
Well, champ.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.950
Thing you did in Abo town is the
one thing that does matter to us.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.622
Now you can do all the lying
and confessing you'd like.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.581
What feeling do you have when
you wake up in the morning?

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.141
When your feet touch the floor?

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:51.866
Or before that, when you're lying there
thinking about your feet hitting the floor.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.101
What does that feel like for you?

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.719
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.039
No, mate. I don't.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.119
You don't?

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.461
No, mate. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.599
What the fuck?

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.821
Phew!

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.305
Is that it?

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.026
That was easy.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.220
Do I shoot him again
just to be sure?

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.078
No.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.238
Mmm.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.639
That was easy. There
were only three of 'em.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.866
Thought it was gonna
be way more harder.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.185
You tied up?

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:01.519
I snuck up on these two.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.426
They were just hanging there.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.983
I came through the gate here.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:25.144
I dug a hole out. Slipped
underneath the fence.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.622
Get the truck over there.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.270
Come on, man.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.981
You want me to drive for a while?

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.301
No.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.626
I know I feel comfortable with someone
when I can just sit, not talking to them.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.661
Yeah.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.661
I just like sitting
there, not talking.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.104
I just feel comfortable
sittin' there, you know.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.107
I had a pain in my side real bad.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.703
It's starting to hurt.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.590
I think maybe I gotta
do something with it.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.870
Don't look bad?

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:26.261
Let's put that bandage back on.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.269
I think it broke, man.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.239
You got any fuel?

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.799
50 US.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.319
50 Australian.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.879
US dollars.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.439
I'm out of US.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.824
I only take American money.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.319
What's wrong with Australian money?

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.119
Either take it or leave it.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.948
It's paper. It's worthless.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.399
Yeah, whatever, mate, I don't care.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.079
It's a piece of fucking paper!

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.999
Take it or leave it.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.031
How much you need, man?

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.385
50 US.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.999
Have you got any .38 in there?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.079
Yeah.

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.782
Let me get a box of that.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.229
And a box of 9 millimeter
for my friend here.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.190
Thank you kindly.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.224
There's the house.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.199
All them others empty.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.506
They ain't got people
in them anymore.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.948
Are they alone in there?

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.439
For now they are.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.959
Until them other people come, but that ain't
gonna be for another week or somethin'.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.719
And there's Gordon, whose
house it is, but he's old.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.660
Real old.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.709
Do you know this?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.105
I know it.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.759
We'll go there in the morning.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.462
There'll be less trouble.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.904
I'm gonna kill him.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.268
I'm going to kill Henry.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.465
Go to sleep.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.548
There's money up there too,
we can take if we want.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.431
Go to sleep.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.630
What you doing?

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.984
What you doing?

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.910
Just wait there.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.750
They're asleep.

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:12.264
There's two in the back
room. I'll take them.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.590
There's two in the room
on the other side.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.599
If you take them, we'll bring
them into this front room.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.999
Okay? But no shooting.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.065
All right?

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.270
Don't say a word.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.586
Slowly lift your
head off the pillow.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.591
What the fuck?

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.743
Kick your blanket off.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.029
Both of you get up.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.981
Henry.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.181
Henry.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.070
Henry, wake up.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.027
Rey?

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.380
You gotta get up.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.429
Rey, what the fuck?

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.959
You too, Gordon.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.869
You gotta get up. You both
gotta get up outta bed.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.439
What are you doing? Stop
pointing that thing at me.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.030
Don't make me keep saying it.
You got to get up out of bed.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:41.746
Sit down. Sit.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.944
Sit on your hands.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.101
What's going on in there?

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.119
See, Henry?

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.159
You gotta get up outta bed.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.669
Rey, who's in there?

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.228
He won't get up outta bed.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.311
Put the gun down, Rey.

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.359
You put yours down.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.791
Rey, put the gun down.
I ain't playing.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.519
Why are you doing this?

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.319
Why did you leave me there?

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.590
Leave you where?

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.759
You know where. On the
road, when I was shot.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.239
Rey, we thought you was dead.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.879
No.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.559
But I wasn't. But I wasn't
dead and you left me there.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.867
Rey, I thought you was dead.
Now put down the fuckin' gun!

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.704
You put yours down.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.224
What's going on?

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.039
I gotta piss.

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.583
Don't you fuckin' move.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.039
I thought you was my brother, man.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:05.506
God damn it, Rey! I am your brother.
Now put down the fuckin' gun.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.439
I thought you was my brother.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.759
Rey, if you don't put down
the gun I'm gonna shoot you.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.030
All right? I ain't lyin'.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.159
You was supposed to be my
brother, Henry. You told Pa.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.624
Rey, put down the goddamn gun!

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:23.599
I thought you was my brother
and you just left me there.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.461
What's going on in there?

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.667
What did you do to my brother?

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.501
Huh?

01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.711
Answer me.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.701
What did you do to my brother?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.509
I didn't do anything.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.870
Yes, you did.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.229
What did you do to him?

01:31:18.305 --> 01:31:24.202
