WEBVTT

00:07.107 --> 00:08.674
- The world doesn't work
like that.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.009
- Why not?

00:10.011 --> 00:11.010
- 'Cause you can't
have something

00:11.012 --> 00:12.211
just because you want it.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.712
- But Henry's parents
got it for him.

00:13.714 --> 00:17.082
- This is our house, our family.
We do what's best for us.

00:17.084 --> 00:19.118
I'm not paying for a video game
bus to be parked out front

00:19.120 --> 00:20.386
for three hours.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.255
[zipper rasps]
- Okay.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.556
- "Okay" you give up,

00:24.558 --> 00:26.058
or "okay" you understand
what I'm saying?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.393
- "Okay," I give up.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.764
[phone buzzing]

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:42.609 --> 00:45.044
- What's going on?

00:45.046 --> 00:46.378
- It's--it's horrible.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.490
- Tender-age black male.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.492
Executed.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.829
One shot to the head,
other to the chest.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.831
Third was in his back.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.504
.9 millimeter.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.541
- There's no signs
of a struggle,

01:15.543 --> 01:17.476
and no signs
that he was restrained.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.511
- Maybe he knew
the assailant,

01:19.513 --> 01:21.447
and they led him back here.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.256
- Did you see who took the kid
down the side street?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.092
- No.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.361
- How about we talk
later on, in private?

01:36.363 --> 01:37.629
- No.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.399
You seen how they blew
that little kid away.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.734
What you think they
gonna do to me?

01:44.237 --> 01:46.872
- I saw this white SUV
drive around the playground.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.474
Slow.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.641
Kind of big.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.477
It had a roof rack on it.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.346
And then I glance over
and see four guys get out.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.614
That's all I saw.

01:55.616 --> 02:00.119
- Only white people who roll
through here are buying drugs.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.420
And they don't
get out the car.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.222
- Okay.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.324
Did you recognize
any of them?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.392
- No.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.627
- What about a license plate
number?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.698
- No. I told you what I saw.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.867
- Okay.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.305
- I can't believe this.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.507
- Let me through.
Let me through!

02:21.509 --> 02:22.708
- You can't cross.
- Let me go.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.643
- I'm sorry.
- Let me through!

02:24.645 --> 02:26.411
- Guys, this is Lauren Brooks.
I think she's the mom.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.147
- Ma'am, I have to warn you--
- Just show me.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.549
- Ma'am...
- Go ahead.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.754
- Oh, my God.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.356
Oh, my God.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.525
[sobbing]
Oh, my God!

02:39.527 --> 02:41.693
Oh, my God.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.529
- I'm sorry.
I can't let you touch him.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.398
- [wailing]

02:46.400 --> 02:48.267
- Hey!

02:48.269 --> 02:49.468
Is that him?
- Sorry, sir, you can't cross.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.636
- Is that Noah?

02:50.638 --> 02:52.771
Hey, I'm Brian Johnson.
I'm Noah's dad.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.306
Is that Noah?
- Let him through.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.314
[breathing heavily]

03:02.316 --> 03:03.415
- You did this!

03:03.417 --> 03:07.219
You did this!
You brought this on him!

03:07.221 --> 03:08.620
- Noah.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.222
Noah, get up.
- I understand, man.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.523
- Oh!

03:11.525 --> 03:13.492
You understand?
Man, move!

03:13.494 --> 03:15.761
- Come on, bro. Bro.
I'm Officer Atwater.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.429
- Oh!
- All right?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.664
What's your name,
little man?

03:18.666 --> 03:21.333
- That's my brother, Miles, man.
Watch out.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.535
- Soon as the time is right,

03:23.537 --> 03:24.670
we gonna figure out
who did this.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.205
We just gonna have to ask
both of y'all

03:26.207 --> 03:28.240
maybe a couple questions,

03:28.242 --> 03:29.841
so we can figure out
who did this, man.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.511
- Oh, no.
- All right?

03:32.513 --> 03:35.247
Come on, man.
We got this, man.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.282
Come on, brother.
We got this.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.456
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.891
- Yeah, you're right.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.559
- Hey, hey, hey.
We got this.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.827
Don't make things worse,
all right?

03:48.829 --> 03:51.897
- Worse? Huh?

03:51.899 --> 03:54.333
How are things supposed
to get worse right now?

03:54.335 --> 03:56.635
- You know what I mean.
- My boy is dead!

03:56.637 --> 03:58.437
- Please.
- My boy is--my boy is...

03:58.439 --> 03:59.871
[gasps]

04:18.825 --> 04:20.993
- I'm so sorry.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.595
- My first partner,
25 years ago,

04:23.597 --> 04:25.530
told me something
I've always remembered

04:25.532 --> 04:27.733
and it'll always be true...

04:29.936 --> 04:34.473
We solve the cases
that need to be solved.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.845
This case needs to be solved.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.389
- Come on, we got to get you
out of here.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.458
- [sobbing]

05:10.710 --> 05:12.577
- The victim:
Noah Johnson.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.546
His father, Brian Johnson.
According to gang database,

05:14.548 --> 05:19.785
He does have priors; possession,
attempt to distribute, and UUW.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.653
- Any other rival gangs
the Westside Posse

05:21.655 --> 05:22.821
are currently
beefing with?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.089
- Oh, we're looking into it.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.558
Just waiting for more intel
from CPIC.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.926
- Might've been
a retaliation hit.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.561
- On a 6-year-old kid?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.930
Is that what we're
talking about?

05:31.932 --> 05:35.067
- We're entertaining
every possible scenario, Adam.

05:35.069 --> 05:38.804
- Everybody is.
Look into all family members

05:38.806 --> 05:40.105
all relatives,
everybody.

05:40.107 --> 05:43.542
Start turning the screws
on every known gang member

05:43.544 --> 05:44.543
in the immediate zone.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.813
Lock them up for jaywalking
if you have to.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.082
Start flipping these guys
one at a time.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.650
Someone is gonna talk,

05:51.652 --> 05:53.051
especially if they're looking
at time.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.420
- Commander.
- Ma'am. Reverend.

05:55.422 --> 05:58.757
that this case is the highest
priority right now

05:58.759 --> 06:00.659
Sergeant.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.466
- You know Reverend Pembelton?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.067
- Yes, I do.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.136
It's been awhile.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.071
- You were assigned to
the gang unit for ten years.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.940
- Fifteen.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.008
- That's why I want you
to lead this investigation.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.545
There's been some hard feelings
between the current gang unit

06:20.547 --> 06:25.117
- Sometimes hard feelings
are unavoidable, Commander.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.018
- It's unacceptable,
what happened today.

06:27.020 --> 06:31.123
As a city, as a society,
it cannot be tolerated.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.024
- We're in agreement.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.060
- I will use every resource,
every fiber in my being,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.129
to find out who did this,
and when I do,

06:37.131 --> 06:38.630
I want to know
the best course of action.

06:38.632 --> 06:43.502
Whoever did this is a lot safer
with us than they are out there.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.736
- Are they?

06:46.739 --> 06:49.074
- You know, I'd rather not
make this a referendum

06:49.076 --> 06:51.410
on the entire
Chicago Police Department.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.512
- To borrow from
the popular vernacular,

06:53.514 --> 06:56.681
I need to know that black lives
matter to you, Sergeant Voight.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.083
- Black lives
do matter to me.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.584
Who do you think I've been
trying to protect

06:59.586 --> 07:01.420
the last 25 years?

07:04.791 --> 07:06.892
I'm not the enemy here.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.996
- Do I have your word
that if I facilitate

07:10.998 --> 07:12.964
the surrender of the person
or persons involved,

07:12.966 --> 07:15.500
they will be
treated humanely?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.602
- You have my word.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.141
- First bullet went in
right above his left eye socket.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.976
Second bullet
right above his heart.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.745
Third bullet in his back.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.781
He may have been trying
to crawl away.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.684
- Any signs of abuse?

07:32.686 --> 07:36.121
- No. Neither recent
nor preexisting.

07:36.123 --> 07:40.559
I usually don't ask this,
but have you made any arrest?

07:40.561 --> 07:41.927
- Not yet.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.230
- How long has the boy's mom
been outside?

07:45.232 --> 07:48.767
- An hour.
She won't leave.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.939
- At the place
where we found your son,

07:53.941 --> 07:57.642
you told your boy's father
that he did this.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.512
What'd you mean
by that?

08:04.717 --> 08:06.151
- [sighs]

08:07.720 --> 08:12.057
Brian's been mixed up
in a gang his whole life.

08:12.059 --> 08:16.161
And they've been going at it
recently with another gang.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.998
The G Park Lords.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.635
Threats were made
back and forth.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.837
That's what I heard, anyway.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.606
Me and Brian
don't live together.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.907
- Any names mentioned?

08:28.909 --> 08:31.543
- Not to me.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.681
I told Brian,
when we had Noah,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.783
he had to get out,

08:38.784 --> 08:41.253
'cause--'cause he's
a dad now.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.621
And...

08:42.623 --> 08:45.557
And he did for awhile, but...

08:52.732 --> 08:54.599
[sighs]

08:54.601 --> 08:56.835
- Is there someplace
we can drive you?

08:56.837 --> 08:59.204
- I just want
to be near my son.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.911
I want to be near my son.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.114
[siren whoops]

09:10.883 --> 09:14.719
- What's going on?

09:14.721 --> 09:15.820
Move along.

09:15.822 --> 09:16.922
[indistinct shouting]

09:16.924 --> 09:18.323
- Hey!
What the hell's going on here?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.225
Hey, step back!
Get back right now.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.562
- Hey, you don't want to be
saying stuff like that, Brian.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.763
- He lost his son.
I feel for him.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.131
But he can't go around
throwing punches.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.199
- You know what you said!

09:28.201 --> 09:29.701
- Get back!
- Come on!

09:29.703 --> 09:31.603
- Step back.
Get out that door right now.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.104
Walk out that door
right now.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.272
- I'm gonna see you!

09:34.274 --> 09:37.943
trying to take my mind
off things for one damn second,

09:37.945 --> 09:39.244
and this clown
comes up and says

09:39.246 --> 09:40.712
if it was his kid
that was murdered,

09:40.714 --> 09:42.213
he'd be out there trying to look
for the killer

09:42.215 --> 09:45.617
So you know it was time for him
to get his ass kicked.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.719
- Okay.

09:47.721 --> 09:51.756
So this guy you fought,
Sam Fowley, y'all got history?

09:51.758 --> 09:54.926
- No. But I better not
see his ass again.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.227
- Slow down.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.032
I just want to ask you...

10:01.034 --> 10:04.135
what was your son like?

10:04.137 --> 10:06.638
Noah?

10:06.640 --> 10:08.239
What kind of kid was Noah?

10:16.983 --> 10:20.719
- Um...

10:20.721 --> 10:22.621
He was, um...

10:25.257 --> 10:27.626
He was like--he was my--

10:27.628 --> 10:29.294
He was my little buddy,
you know?

10:31.364 --> 10:34.666
On the days
when I had him...

10:34.668 --> 10:36.701
it was just, um...

10:39.305 --> 10:41.339
It was just me and him,
you know? And...

10:42.642 --> 10:44.142
[sighs]
Man.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.647
Oh...
Sh--

10:50.916 --> 10:53.818
This was my--my--

10:53.820 --> 10:54.986
my little boy.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.254
Oh!

11:02.795 --> 11:05.196
- Is there anybody you know
who would do this, Brian?

11:06.132 --> 11:07.999
- He was 6.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.801
No.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.037
- No enemies?
No beef?

11:12.039 --> 11:14.139
I mean, think about it.
- No, man. No.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.841
- Did your son have anything
of value that he liked to wear?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.143
- No.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.878
- Did he have a cell phone?

11:24.817 --> 11:27.786
- The G Park Lords.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.454
- What about them?

11:32.825 --> 11:34.225
- We understand
that your gang was--

11:34.227 --> 11:35.727
- I'm not in no gang.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.162
I used to be.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.297
I dropped my flags
the day Noah was born.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.032
So whatever database
y'all got me on,

11:41.034 --> 11:42.167
y'all need to update it.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.868
- Okay.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.171
What about the gang
you used to be in?

11:47.306 --> 11:49.040
That gang,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.276
are they or are they not at war
with the G Park Lords?

11:51.278 --> 11:52.744
- Yeah. I guess.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.779
- And is there anybody
in that gang

11:54.781 --> 11:57.182
that might have it out for you,
even if it's an old beef?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.817
- Not that I know of.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.122
- Then who would do this,
Brian?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.891
Who would look a 6-year-old
in the eye at close range

12:06.893 --> 12:08.860
and put three bullets in him?

12:08.862 --> 12:11.763
- Look, man, I'm telling you,
I have no idea!

12:11.765 --> 12:13.498
I swear to God!

12:15.267 --> 12:18.903
All that gang nonsense,
yeah, I know guys in them,

12:18.905 --> 12:21.906
but I been out, man.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.112
I mean, something like this?
I...

12:28.047 --> 12:29.881
[sighs]

12:29.883 --> 12:32.817
I don't have no beef
with nobody, man.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.957
I swear--I swear to God,
I don't.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.262
- All right, thanks.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.030
So the bar that Brian
was busted at

12:46.032 --> 12:48.900
is a known hangout
for the Westside Posse.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.935
Nobody goes in there
without being affiliated.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.470
- One of my C.I.'s
just told me

12:52.472 --> 12:55.273
that they're planning some
sort of payback against G Park.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.208
Like, big-time.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.150
- Most people I've stood over

13:05.152 --> 13:07.552
put themselves
in that situation.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.488
This kid never had
a choice.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.191
- Drive-by shooting.
G Park Lords territory.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.228
- Let's go.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.139
- Drive-by.
Black four-door sedan.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.375
Target was Jesse Kemp,
18 years old.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.577
Got shot in the leg,
twice in the arm,

13:32.579 --> 13:34.179
but he'll make it.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.215
It's a miracle no one
walking by got shot.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.317
Shooter dropped 20 rounds
at least.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.985
- Is this your beat?
- Yeah.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.387
- Is Kemp hooked up
with the G Park Lords?

13:42.389 --> 13:44.222
- Very much so.
- Where's Kemp now?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.490
- Over there
with the paramedics.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.425
I got my partner over there
babysitting him.

13:47.427 --> 13:51.563
- You got any more information
on the offenders' vehicle?

13:51.565 --> 13:54.599
- Not yet.
Typical OEMC call.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.101
Heard shots, found body.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.204
- Any witnesses?
- Sure.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.841
Willing to come forward?
No.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.043
- Whoa, whoa. Detective Dawson.
Intelligence.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.546
- You can have it down at Med.
We're about to roll out.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.114
- You can wait a minute.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.383
Who shot you, Jesse?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.085
- I need medical treatment now.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.321
- You tell me who shot you,
you're on your way.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.022
- I didn't get a good look.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.157
- Why'd they come after you?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.558
- No idea.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.193
- Maybe it's because
you were involved

14:22.195 --> 14:23.428
in the murder
of Noah Johnson.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.096
That'd be my guess.
- Wrong guy.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.631
- You got to get out the ambo,
Detective.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.900
- Wrong guy.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.902
- If you were involved
in killing that boy,

14:30.904 --> 14:32.203
you're gonna get got
eventually.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.404
They ain't gonna miss twice.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.540
But we can help you.
Keep you alive.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.475
- I ain't scared.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.277
You think I ain't never
been shot before?

14:39.279 --> 14:40.545
- Detective!

14:46.051 --> 14:47.619
- He's all yours.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.592
- Excuse me, Sergeant.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.094
Jesse Kemp lives
with his mom.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.428
Her house is two blocks
from here.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.964
- Hit it.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.166
[knock on door]

15:02.168 --> 15:04.035
- We're Detectives
Lindsay and Halstead.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.503
Does Jesse Kemp live here?

15:05.505 --> 15:06.905
- Auntie, the cops are here.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.274
Yeah. Come in.
I'm his cousin, Chelsea.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.441
Is he okay?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.911
- Hey, is Jesse okay?

15:12.913 --> 15:14.479
- He's gonna be okay.
He's on his way to Chicago Med.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.981
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.350
- Ma'am, we think Jesse
may have been targeted.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.319
- For what?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.488
- A 6-year-old boy
was found dead this morning.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.057
- I heard. It's beyond...

15:26.059 --> 15:27.292
- I'm sorry to ask this,

15:27.294 --> 15:29.093
but do you know
if he was involved at all?

15:29.095 --> 15:31.596
- Absolutely not.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.164
And for a minute I thought that
you were here for my family

15:33.166 --> 15:34.332
to help us through this.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.634
- Okay, four men were seen
in a white SUV

15:36.636 --> 15:38.536
approach the boy
right before he was found dead

15:38.538 --> 15:39.671
near a playground.

15:39.673 --> 15:43.608
Now, maybe he drove,
or maybe he was the lookout.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.176
- How dare you come
into my house

15:45.178 --> 15:47.211
and accuse my son of this.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.047
- Ma'am, I know
that it seems harsh,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.382
but we're actually here because
we're trying to do you a favor.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.252
- Whichever of the four guys
involved comes forward first,

15:54.254 --> 15:56.421
it's his story
that gets etched in stone.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.357
He's the one
that gets the best deal.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.192
- You want to do me a favor,
sweetheart?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.593
Leave.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.196
- I'm telling you,
if you're looking out for Jesse

16:05.198 --> 16:07.365
and he was involved,
help him out.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.001
- Out of my house now.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.342
- What's up?

16:17.344 --> 16:18.743
- Miles, right?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.111
- Yeah.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.613
- Do you know
if Brian's home?

16:22.615 --> 16:25.183
- I think so.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.318
You get who killed
Noah yet?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.020
- No. We need to find out
who they are

16:29.022 --> 16:30.388
before we can get them.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.224
- Right.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.061
- Do you know who killed
your nephew, Miles?

16:37.063 --> 16:39.664
- He doesn't know anything.
Get in the house.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.407
What's up?

16:49.409 --> 16:52.543
- Jesse Kemp was shot
earlier today.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.613
You know him?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.448
- No.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.716
But I been home all day.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.418
I got friends
that can vouch for that.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.388
- We think you know
who's involved, though.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.259
Give us a name, dog.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.061
It ain't gonna
get back to you.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.598
Trust me.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.201
- Look, you know I can't snitch
on nobody.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.137
It's gonna get handled
the way it's gonna get handled.

17:29.081 --> 17:32.483
- Jesse Kemp just had his lawyer
visit him at Chicago Med.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.253
That was Vikan
from the gang unit.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.455
He said Brian is affiliated
with the gang,

17:37.457 --> 17:39.057
but he's not
a trigger man.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.459
He does just enough
to not have fellow gang members

17:41.461 --> 17:46.097
He can't imagine any scenario
in which the G Park Lords

17:46.099 --> 17:49.333
would put a hit on Brian,
let alone on his 6-year-old son.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.334
- Good news.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.736
- We could use some.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.072
- I was able to contact
Maurice Owens. Know of him?

17:54.074 --> 17:56.074
- I do.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.241
- He's willing to meet
you and me

17:57.243 --> 17:58.676
and help arrange a truce
on the streets.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.244
My hope is, he might
even point us

18:00.246 --> 18:01.446
in the direction
of the killers.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.214
He's at Stateville
Penitentiary.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.582
- Yeah, I know.
I put him there.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.284
- We'll need to leave
right now.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.820
- Look, that's a wasted trip,
Reverend. I'm sorry.

18:08.822 --> 18:11.823
- He's the leader
of the G Park Lords.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.357
- Was.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.359
Reverend, the gangs now,
they're splinter units.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.594
They don't kick it
upstairs anymore.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.629
Maurice has no pull. None.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.398
If he was out
on the streets tomorrow

18:20.400 --> 18:23.501
telling people what to do,
he'd be laughed at or shot.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.303
The city has changed.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.771
Maurice doesn't want
to believe it,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.372
you may not want to believe it,

18:28.374 --> 18:31.609
but that's the reality.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.278
- What can I do?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.548
- Just keep doing what you've
been doing the last 25 years.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.718
Reverend, you've kept at least
10 crimes off my desk every day

18:40.720 --> 18:41.886
doing what you do,

18:41.888 --> 18:44.789
so please just
keep doing it.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.225
- And if you can,

18:47.227 --> 18:48.759
get the word out.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.629
Any retaliation is gonna
increase the tragedy

18:51.631 --> 18:53.231
of what happened.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.500
- I know that sermon.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.836
- Appreciate you.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.840
- Come on. I'll walk you out.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.712
- All right, anything new
on that white SUV?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.680
- No. And Jesse Kemp doesn't,

19:09.682 --> 19:11.449
nor has he ever
owned or rented one

19:11.451 --> 19:13.818
of any color.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.720
- Hold up.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.623
We've been checking
all contact cards,

19:18.625 --> 19:19.891
traffic citations issued.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.759
Arrests, right?
- Yeah.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.761
- Last week,
a 22-year-old male

19:23.763 --> 19:25.296
was pulled over by a beat car

19:25.298 --> 19:27.565
on a stop-and-frisk
in G Park Lord territory.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.367
He's from a different gang,
the Two-Threes,

19:29.369 --> 19:30.601
which are way south.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.636
- Hmm.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.605
- His name's
Bryan Johnson.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.708
Spelled B-R-Y-A-N.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.714
Is there any chance G Park went
after the wrong Brian Johnson?

19:50.522 --> 19:51.889
- So the new Bryan Johnson

19:51.891 --> 19:53.758
does some shady stuff
against G Park,

19:53.760 --> 19:57.461
G Park gets it mixed up and
goes after wrong Bryan Johnson?

19:57.463 --> 19:58.863
- I don't know
what the hell happened, Kevin.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.800
Gangs unit says this
Brian Johnson isn't a hitter.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.202
This Bryan Johnson is,

20:04.204 --> 20:07.638
day before Noah gets killed
in what's looking more and more

20:07.640 --> 20:09.440
like a retaliation hit
by G Park.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.776
- All right, same work-up we did
on the first Brian Johnson,

20:11.778 --> 20:13.511
let's do it for this one.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.246
Start building
a whole new timeline.

20:15.248 --> 20:18.416
- Hey, the 34th District
just reported an SUV

20:18.418 --> 20:19.784
torched off Cicero.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.619
There's a cargo rack
attached to the roof.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.354
- Let's go.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.795
- It's torched down
to the rims.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.430
- How was Diego's party?

20:32.432 --> 20:34.265
- Still going.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.300
- Mouse ran the plate you sent.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.703
Car's registered
to a Lydia Bernstein

20:38.705 --> 20:41.505
out of Springfield, Illinois.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.873
- Original color
listed as white?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.309
- Yeah.
- Bet they came back hot, right?

20:45.311 --> 20:47.445
- Not reported.
So he's checking to see

20:47.447 --> 20:49.480
if she's related
to any of our suspects.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.715
- Bernstein?

20:50.717 --> 20:52.316
Probably not related.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.951
- Fair. Connected.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.953
- All right, get Springfield PD
to pound on her door.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.556
We need names of everyone
who had access to this vehicle.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.724
- Got it.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.892
- Dash is melted.
Column's got pulled out.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.828
- Forensics isn't gonna be able
to pull a print off this thing.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.630
- A GPS system?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.431
- Yeah. It's still in there.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.300
Can't pull the guts out
without my tools.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.369
- All right, have it towed
back to the roll-up.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.738
We know where this car's been,
our life gets a little easier.

21:13.740 --> 21:18.776
- Lydia Bernstein's been
in Cancun for the past ten days.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.911
Her car was parked
at the long-term lot at Midway.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.780
She didn't even know
it was even missing.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.615
- Ruzek, you on parking lot
surveillance?

21:24.617 --> 21:27.318
If that's what you want
to call it, Boss.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.521
- You can't get
a cleaner picture?

21:30.523 --> 21:32.390
- No, this is the best I got.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.791
So, based on this video,

21:33.793 --> 21:37.361
we're either looking
for a human being or a yeti.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.796
I don't know.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.930
- Run it through
face recognition.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.399
Maybe something will pop.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.068
- Where are we at with this new
Bryan Johnson?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.804
- Beat cops did a sneak-a-peek
at his residence.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.539
Place was tossed.
The back door was open,

21:48.541 --> 21:51.742
So it's looking like he took
everything near and dear to him

21:51.744 --> 21:52.910
and left in a hurry.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.313
- All right,
someone find me this yeti.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.983
- 6 years old.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.818
- Craziness, man.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.053
- I was looking
at his school photo.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.021
It made me think of Landigal.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.956
When we breached the mud hut
with the boy.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.658
- I don't want to talk
about that day, man.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.026
- Yeah.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.062
I just brought it up
because it reminded me of--

22:11.064 --> 22:13.097
- I just told you I don't
want to talk about it.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.533
- Okay.
- It's intact.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.603
- No, I need...

22:19.605 --> 22:21.605
Okay. Yeah, fine.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.810
So our expert tech lab
doesn't even have

22:25.812 --> 22:27.945
the actual cable they need
to extract

22:27.947 --> 22:29.947
the vehicle's GPS
information.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.949
- Wait.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.984
Remember the D'Alio case?

22:33.986 --> 22:35.419
When I was researching tech,

22:35.421 --> 22:36.887
there was some forensic
software company

22:36.889 --> 22:39.090
that can extract information
from navigational systems.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.758
The whole process
should take minutes.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.859
- Done. Let's do that.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.060
- It's not gonna be cheap,
though.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.929
It's a private contractor.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.598
- All right, we'll pass
the hat around upstairs.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.600
- Copy that.
I'll make a call.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.135
- All right.

22:58.677 --> 23:01.412
- Hey, Sarge, we got some
$600 information for you.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.114
Want to whack it eight ways?
- No, I'll cover it.

23:03.116 --> 23:04.382
What is it?

23:04.384 --> 23:05.750
- All right.
- Okay.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.518
- It looks like our vehicle
was parked

23:07.520 --> 23:09.954
a block and a half away
from the playground at 7:52 a.m.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.822
That's 15 minutes
right before Noah's murder.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.125
Then we got three hits
of the SUV parked

23:14.127 --> 23:16.660
at 4802 South Champlain
on three separate occasions

23:16.662 --> 23:20.865
- Right, now that house belongs
to 65-year-old Sandy Lowe,

23:20.867 --> 23:22.733
who lives there with her
18-year-old grandson,

23:22.735 --> 23:24.468
Colin Lowe.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.771
According to Gang Intelligence,
he's highly active

23:26.773 --> 23:28.973
in the G Park Lords.
Self-admitted.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.976
He's a senior at West Park Lake
High School with Jesse Kemp.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.945
- That was worth
every penny.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.415
Tell everyone to gear up.
We're rolling out.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.470
[keys clanging]

23:59.472 --> 24:01.806
- That's him.
Cover the house.

24:01.808 --> 24:05.176
- Colin Lowe!
Chicago Police! Stop!

24:06.445 --> 24:09.046
- [panting]

24:12.584 --> 24:14.718
- Chicago PD! Stop!

24:24.229 --> 24:26.030
[tires squeal]

24:39.177 --> 24:41.178
- You're good, you're good.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.015
- Clear.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.587
- [panting]

24:54.626 --> 24:55.893
- Kev.

25:23.588 --> 25:25.089
- Anyone come through here?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.524
- No.

25:31.796 --> 25:33.097
I haven't seen anyone.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.766
- [whispering]
Does he have a gun?

25:36.868 --> 25:39.136
Back up.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.746
Get on the ground now!

25:48.748 --> 25:51.749
Put your knees
on the ground!

25:51.751 --> 25:52.850
- Okay, man.
- Now!

25:52.852 --> 25:54.885
- Okay!
- Down!

25:54.887 --> 25:56.987
All right, crawl towards me.
Come on now.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.589
- Okay--
- Crawl towards me!

25:58.591 --> 26:00.090
- Man, you're pointing a gun
at me, man.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.926
- Get down.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.561
- Police brutality.

26:03.563 --> 26:04.995
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Damn!

26:04.997 --> 26:06.564
- Offender in custody.

26:11.603 --> 26:13.671
- Hey, look, man,
I ran 'cause I thought--

26:13.673 --> 26:15.706
- We all know
why you ran, Colin.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.108
- We? No, we don't
know nothing.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.244
I don't know nothing
'bout nothing.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.279
At all.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.881
- Know him?

26:25.283 --> 26:26.984
- Yeah. That's my partner.
Yeah.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.986
- You're both
in the G Park Lords.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.856
- Yeah, kind of.
Sometimes.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.992
- Know him?

26:34.994 --> 26:36.293
- No.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.896
- Him?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.132
- No.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.039
No.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.675
- Why was a stolen white SUV
parked at your place on and off

26:51.677 --> 26:53.043
the last few days?

26:53.045 --> 26:56.246
- I mean, look, man.
I'm handsome.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.048
People put up on me
all the time.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.984
I'm quite sure
y'all remember those days.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.152
- Here's what we're thinking.

27:02.154 --> 27:05.356
You, Jesse,
and two other males

27:05.358 --> 27:09.360
stole that SUV to get payback
on Brian Johnson.

27:09.362 --> 27:13.163
And for reasons beyond
a lot of people's comprehension,

27:13.165 --> 27:16.667
including my own,

27:16.669 --> 27:19.837
you decided to kill
Brian's son Noah.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.740
Problem is,
you may have gone

27:22.742 --> 27:25.843
after the wrong
Brian Johnson.

27:25.845 --> 27:29.647
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.389
- That tightness you feel
in your chest?

27:40.925 --> 27:42.326
That's panic.

27:44.396 --> 27:48.198
From knowing that we know
95% of what went down.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.234
The other 5%

27:50.236 --> 27:54.204
is just the names of the other
two guys involved.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.407
And believe me,
we are gonna find out--

27:56.409 --> 27:58.242
- Man, y'all tripping, man--

27:58.244 --> 28:00.044
- Don't interrupt me.

28:04.382 --> 28:05.849
We are gonna find out
who they are.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.351
And I'll tell you what, Colin.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.293
- Because a 6-year-old...
- Get that out of my face, man.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.698
- ...Was executed...

28:21.733 --> 28:23.167
Look at me.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.804
Look at me. Look at me.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.472
- [exhales]

28:29.874 --> 28:31.909
- We're not gonna get tired
of investigating this

28:31.911 --> 28:34.144
and shove it in some drawer.

28:37.882 --> 28:41.485
Now, who else
is involved?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.789
- Like I said,

28:45.791 --> 28:48.225
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.235
- You can do that.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.438
You can keep clicking your
heels, hoping this goes away.

29:05.009 --> 29:07.277
But we already got enough
to ring you and Jesse up

29:07.279 --> 29:08.812
for the murder
of Noah Johnson.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.013
- "We"?
What's up with this "we"?

29:10.015 --> 29:11.215
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.150
- The hell you don't.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.220
[door closes]

29:18.890 --> 29:20.858
- I'm not approving charges.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.860
Not until you guys
have something I can prosecute.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.294
- What?

29:24.296 --> 29:25.796
- All you have
is circumstantial evidence.

29:25.798 --> 29:27.464
What I need
is an eyeball witness.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.067
- Steve,
I can think of five cases

29:30.069 --> 29:31.268
you brought to a grand jury

29:31.270 --> 29:32.903
with this amount of evidence
or less.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.372
- Not since Laquan McDonald
I haven't.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.940
You bring me a case now,

29:36.942 --> 29:38.809
I need to be able
to bounce a quarter off it.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.210
- That little boy
was executed.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.179
- Don't.
Don't hold that over me.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.381
I know what it's like
to lose a child to violence.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.821
- You think I want the killers
out there, walking around?

29:52.390 --> 29:54.424
I need a confession,
a statement,

29:54.426 --> 29:57.227
a weapon or an eyewitness,
or no go.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.105
- [sighs]

30:39.904 --> 30:42.573
- I thought I saw the worst
of it with the Tyshawn Lee case,

30:42.575 --> 30:44.241
and then this comes along.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.877
Do you realize
that during Desert Storm

30:46.879 --> 30:49.313
we lost 150 men and women
in action.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.548
In Chicago 2015,

30:51.550 --> 30:54.151
we were at 480.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.920
You gonna tell me we don't have
a war on our streets?

30:56.922 --> 30:58.922
- Nobody even wants our help.
Nobody's backing us.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.123
- No.
- I got cell phone cameras

31:00.125 --> 31:01.592
in my face every stop.

31:01.594 --> 31:03.427
You make one wrong move,
you say one wrong thing,

31:03.429 --> 31:04.995
they're coming at you
for punitive damages.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.496
- True.
- Every day another copper's

31:06.498 --> 31:09.066
headed down to
Corporation Counsel to get sued.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.535
- Yeah, well, I can pull
the plug on this any day I want.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.971
20 years vested, Roman.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.439
You know those Kentucky Lake
commercials

31:15.441 --> 31:17.040
you see on TV all the time?

31:17.042 --> 31:19.576
A staked off a lot
with 100 feet of lakefront.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.245
And they don't tax the hell
out of my pension.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.980
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.648
- You of all people.
- What?

31:24.650 --> 31:26.516
- You are always telling me,
"Keep your head up.

31:26.518 --> 31:29.419
Keep pushing forward.
This is the job you chose."

31:29.421 --> 31:32.489
I mean, those are your words,
Sergeant. Your words.

31:40.331 --> 31:41.498
- Hey. Can I help you?

31:41.500 --> 31:44.067
- Yeah.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.136
I'd like to speak
with a Detective Lindsay.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.338
- Come with me.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.306
Buzz me up.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.474
What's your name?

31:50.476 --> 31:53.210
- Chelsea.
- Chelsea. I'm Sean.

31:54.479 --> 31:57.948
- I can't even tell you how much
I appreciate you coming in here.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.450
- Jesse got pulled into this.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.085
And you said the first person
to come in with their story,

32:02.087 --> 32:03.220
they get helped.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.522
- That's right.

32:09.460 --> 32:13.130
- But I also came forward
because

32:13.132 --> 32:18.035
I saw a photo of that boy
on the news.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.704
And people can't do that.

32:20.706 --> 32:24.074
- I know, they can't.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.609
But the thing is,

32:25.611 --> 32:28.278
it's actually up to people
like me and you

32:28.280 --> 32:31.715
to make sure that it doesn't
happen again.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.353
- I've been sick with the flu.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.323
So I've been staying
at my aunt's house all week.

32:39.325 --> 32:43.060
And...I heard everything.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.429
- Okay.

32:45.431 --> 32:49.333
What'd you hear?

32:49.335 --> 32:52.269
- Friend of Jesse's, Colin Lowe,
he was at our house,

32:52.271 --> 32:54.504
and another guy
they go to school with,

32:54.506 --> 32:56.006
Jordan Lockett,

32:56.008 --> 32:58.342
he comes in with his little
brother all worked up.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.679
Jordan says his sister
had been raped a week earlier,

33:02.681 --> 33:05.749
and he had just got a tip
that Brian Johnson done it.

33:08.219 --> 33:10.387
It was all about the get-back
at that point.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.460
Jordan said everything
was fair game.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.329
- The morning of the murder,

33:19.331 --> 33:21.665
Jordan Lockett
tells Jesse and Colin

33:21.667 --> 33:24.067
they're going after
Brian Johnson's son.

33:24.069 --> 33:27.604
Now according to Jesse's cousin,
these two tried to back out,

33:27.606 --> 33:30.340
but Jordan is above them
in the gang and he made threats.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.143
He also decided to bring
his 12-year-old brother Andre

33:33.145 --> 33:34.578
along for the ride.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.346
Jesse and Colin sat lookout.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.249
Jordan and André
led Noah down the block.

33:39.251 --> 33:42.652
- We got to get to Jordan
before Brian's gang does.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.589
- All right, listen,
we stay low out there.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.491
We don't want anyone
on the street to know

33:47.493 --> 33:48.792
we're out in front of this.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.495
And if you do get Jordan,
you keep your head on.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.097
We all know what he did
to that kid.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.166
We split up,
hit every known address.

34:01.806 --> 34:04.341
- Brian's brother's bike.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.176
Miles is in there.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.045
- Come on, man. Please.
- No, come on!

34:08.047 --> 34:10.781
You're killing him!
You ain't have to kill him!

34:10.783 --> 34:14.150
- You ain't have to kill him!
- Please!

34:14.152 --> 34:15.518
Oh, please.
I don't want to die, please.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.353
- Come on, G.
Please don't do this, man.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.688
- Shut up, man.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.290
- Oh, man, please--
- Shut up!

34:20.292 --> 34:22.159
- You killed him.
I'm gonna kill you.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.764
- Shut up, man! You killed him!
- It wasn't me.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.232
- You killed him!
- Put the gun down, Miles.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.237
Put the gun down.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.672
- He killed my nephew.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.507
- We know.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.177
That's exactly why we're here.
Put the gun down, Miles.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.079
- We'll take care of this,
Miles. Put the gun down.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.114
Miles.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.348
- Listen to them.
- Shut up!

34:46.784 --> 34:48.752
- Come on, bro.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.754
This ain't what your brother
would want, Miles.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.688
You know that.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.760
He doesn't even know
you're here, does he?

34:56.762 --> 34:59.196
- This is how it needs
to be handled.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.597
- Hey, hey, hey.
- That's wrong.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.165
You're wrong, Miles.

35:02.167 --> 35:03.700
- Miles...
- Okay?

35:04.836 --> 35:06.503
- Miles, look at me.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.172
Look at me.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.443
Look.

35:14.412 --> 35:16.746
Think of your nephew.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.882
What would he want for you?

35:20.351 --> 35:22.285
Huh?

35:23.788 --> 35:27.858
Locked up in prison
the rest of your life?

35:29.727 --> 35:31.628
I mean, what would he say
if he was here right now?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.365
Huh?

35:36.367 --> 35:38.502
- I don't know.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.638
- Miles, look at me.
You don't want this.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.907
You're better than this.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.476
Don't screw it up now.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.411
Okay?

35:48.413 --> 35:50.647
Real easy.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.849
We'll get through this, okay?

35:54.919 --> 35:56.553
Just take it easy.

35:57.522 --> 35:58.922
Just take it easy.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.158
Don't make things worse.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.692
Please.

36:04.428 --> 36:05.729
That's it.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.631
That's it.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.766
- Get up.
- Get him to the car.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.435
- Come on. Come on.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.678
- [sighs]

36:21.680 --> 36:23.346
Go on. Get out of here.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.249
Go on. Beat it.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.918
No, wait a second.
Wait a second. Hang on.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.686
Go out the back way.

36:41.732 --> 36:43.867
- Is it true we got
the wrong dude?

36:43.869 --> 36:46.203
People were saying that. I ain't
know if it was true or not.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.904
- Who cares if it was
the wrong guy?

36:47.906 --> 36:51.241
You shot a 6-year-old
in the face.

36:51.243 --> 36:52.943
- Your sister ever been raped?

36:52.945 --> 36:54.711
- [scoffs]

36:54.713 --> 36:56.680
That's what you're
leaning on?

36:56.682 --> 36:59.249
- I'd like to see what you do
if that happened.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.618
- You're right.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.690
I'd probably
do something crazy.

37:08.659 --> 37:11.661
But I wouldn't lead a 6-year-old
boy down a side street

37:11.663 --> 37:13.430
and shoot him three times.

37:14.932 --> 37:15.932
No.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.668
- Let me tell you something.

37:18.670 --> 37:22.672
You don't know what you'd do
until it happened.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.541
- No. No, no, no.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.910
I'm telling you

37:26.912 --> 37:29.846
without any doubt
in my mind.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.482
I wouldn't kill
a 6-year-old.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.452
That doesn't happen!

37:36.387 --> 37:38.388
People don't do that!

37:38.390 --> 37:39.623
- Antonio.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.858
- How could you do that?

37:41.860 --> 37:43.927
- Come on. It's all right.
- Huh?

37:43.929 --> 37:47.897
No, it's not all right.
- It's all right.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.299
Yeah, I know.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.768
- It's not all right!
He needs to know!

37:51.770 --> 37:53.036
- I know.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.674
- Come on, brother.
Let's take a walk.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.977
- He's cool. He's cool.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.617
[door closes]

38:10.554 --> 38:12.055
- [laughs]

38:12.057 --> 38:13.857
He got it all wrong, man.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.696
- How so?

38:19.698 --> 38:23.867
- My little brother Andre
pulled the trigger, not me.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.503
- Your 12-year-old brother.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.405
- That's right.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.874
He'll tell you himself.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.075
- Because he's 12

38:32.077 --> 38:34.944
and won't get charged
as an adult.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.481
- 50% that.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.352
50% because
he needed to learn.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.349
- I know it doesn't make it
any easier...

39:14.552 --> 39:17.387
But at least you know
it had nothing to do with you.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.359
- Yeah.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.948
You heard?

39:44.950 --> 39:46.549
- Yeah.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.018
I was just coming by
to see if you did.

40:00.998 --> 40:02.098
- [sighs]

40:40.571 --> 40:42.972
- Listen, I'm sorry I didn't
get the video game bus

40:42.974 --> 40:44.808
for your birthday.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.709
- It's all right.

40:46.711 --> 40:48.912
- No, I was trying to make
a point, I guess.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.047
- What point?

40:53.617 --> 40:55.819
- I don't even remember.

40:55.821 --> 40:58.021
Whatever it was,
it doesn't matter.

40:59.890 --> 41:02.559
- I had a fun time anyways.

41:05.529 --> 41:06.963
- There's something
happening tonight

41:06.965 --> 41:08.665
that I want to take you to,

41:08.667 --> 41:11.701
but first I need to explain
what's going on.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.036
- Okay.

41:15.539 --> 41:17.106
- Okay.
