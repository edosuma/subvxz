You all right?

01:05.700 --> 01:07.300
Everything okay?

01:07.900 --> 01:09.400
Allison,
everything okay?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.600
It's so quiet.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.100
Joe, say something.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.400
Oh, my G, I can't hear.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.800
Oh, my God,
I can't hear!

02:13.100 --> 02:14.000
What are they saying?

02:16.400 --> 02:17.600
We're not sure why.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.000
She just woke up,
and, and she couldn't hear.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.500
No, not a thing.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.500
What are the]rsaying?

02:22.500 --> 02:23.700
Wait.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.700
No, never before.

02:28.600 --> 02:32.400
Uh... no, no viral infection
that we're aware of.o.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.900
No-no, no head trauma,
nothing like that.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.900
It-it just... I don't know.
It just happened.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.100
BRIDGETT
What's going on?

02:39.100 --> 02:41.700
Why does it feel like
the middle of the night?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.400
Paon me. Can you hold on
just one second?

02:43.700 --> 02:45.100
It ithe middle of the night,
Brid,

02:45.100 --> 02:46.600
and I'm on the phone
with the emergency room

02:46.600 --> 02:48.200
and I really need you
to get back to bed.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.300
Why's Daddy

02:52.900 --> 02:54.600
Bed, bed.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.400
Oh, really?
That would be great.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.700
9:00 a.m.?
Absolutely.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.600
We'll be there.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.500
Thank you.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.400
What did they say?

03:14.200 --> 03:15.800
"...tests."

03:15.900 --> 03:17.500
???

03:17.500 --> 03:18.600
Oh, good.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.000
Oh, thank you.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.100
Hey, I don't think
we should say anythi

03:22.100 --> 03:24.100
?褀Gto the girls
until we know more.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.700
I love you.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.700
I don't hear anything.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.800
Your wife's hearg loss
is rather profound.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.700
Let's go speak
in my office.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.800
What is  saying?
I cahear anything!

03:54.800 --> 03:56.000
Shh, shh, shh.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.200
Okay.

04:05.700 --> 04:06.900
DOCTOR:
 <i>I believe your wife</i>

04:06.900 --> 04:09.800
is suffering from something
called SSHL:

04:09.800 --> 04:12.200
suddenensorineural
hearing loss.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.700
It can be caused
by any number of things.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.500
About, uh, 30% of the time,
people just wake up with it.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.800
w, the good news is,
for most people,

04:23.800 --> 04:26.600
the condition simply
goes away on its own.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.600
But you're reasonably confident
that whatever it is,

04:28.600 --> 04:31.100
whatever is causing it
is not a permanent condition?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.400
(ringtone playing)
Sorry, that's my wife's phone.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
Hello?

04:37.400 --> 04:39.700
CYNTHIA:
Forgive meI'm looking
for Allison Dubois.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.000
Have I dialed the wrong number?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.400
No, no.
This is her husband Joe.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.500
Can I ask who's calling?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.000
My name is Cynthia Keener.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.600
Your wife and I have been
doing some work together.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.800
I wondered if I might
have a word with her, please.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.300
To be honest, Cynta,

04:51.300 --> 04:53.600
she woke up this morning
not feeling terribly well.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.900
In fact, we're at the doctor's
right now.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.000
Can I have her call you back?
One of us call you back?

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Of course. Uh, please tell her
I hope she feels better.???

05:02.800 --> 05:04.200
Sorry. You were saying?

05:04.200 --> 05:04.900
You asked me 

05:04.900 --> 05:07.000
if this sort of hearing loss
is ever permanent.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.200
And is it?
It can be.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.100
But... we're a long way
from even thinking about that.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.100
 JOE: What's going on?
BRIDGETTE: What's all
the hollering about?

05:29.100 --> 05:31.400
Hey, hey, are you
all right?
Mom, was that yo

05:32.200 --> 05:34.700
This silence is so...

05:35.100 --> 05:38.800
It's like somebody just put
a blanket over your head.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.700
I felt like

05:41.700 --> 05:44.100
I was going to forget
how to breathe.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.500
And I thought maybe if I just...
 <i>scream!</i>

05:49.900 --> 05:51.500
Maybe I'll hear it.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.900
Maybe it'll start something,

05:54.400 --> 05:57.500
and I'll be okay,
but it didn't work.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.300
Please don't
be scared, guys.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.500
It's okay, Mom.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.200
I know you're going
to get better.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.100
What?!

06:04.800 --> 06:05.500
Feel better, Mom.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.000
Just don't scream.
It's scary.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.100
Oh, I love you, too, babe.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.400
???

06:38.800 --> 06:39.700
What's that?
What are you doing?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.800
I don't want to look
at anything on the computer.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.700
THE GIRLS ARE IN BED

06:49.500 --> 06:50.600
Cool!

06:51.100 --> 06:52.600
Tell me something else.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.000
KEENER CALLED NEED TO CALL HER BACK WHAT DO I SAY

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
I don't want her to know.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.200
I don't want anyone to know.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.400
Maybe you should just tell her
I have the flu.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.000
How are <i>you</i> doing?

07:18.300 --> 07:21.500
MAYBE A LITTLE LONELY

07:32.000 --> 07:33.400
(moaning passionately):
Mmm...

07:33.400 --> 07:34.700
Mmm...

08:22.400 --> 08:24.200
Yeah.
Who are you talking to?

08:24.400 --> 08:26.200
Hold on. Sorry.
Hold on one seco.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.600
Cynthia Keener.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.500
Who?

08:28.600 --> 08:29.800
(shouting):
Kee-ner!

08:31.400 --> 08:32.500
Yeah.
Okay, Miss Keener,

08:32.600 --> 08:34.799
I'll, I'll pass everything
along to her.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.600
Yeah, any information
that she gets,

08:36.600 --> 08:38.299
I'll give it to you
right away.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.400
Okay.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.100
Okay. Hey.
(whistles)

08:42.200 --> 08:43.100
Come...

08:47.700 --> 08:49.400
"She has a case for you."

08:49.400 --> 08:51.400
I thought you told her
I the flu.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.400
"Kidnapping night before last.
12-year-old girl."

09:00.100 --> 09:01.600
COMPLETELY DEAF.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.800
???

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
JOE:
Nicole...

09:10.200 --> 09:12.900
Swenson
is the

09:12.900 --> 09:14.200
daughter of...

09:14.200 --> 09:16.700
Of Laura and Darrin Swenson.

09:16.700 --> 09:17.800
Daughter of

09:18.300 --> 09:20.500
Laura and Darrin
Swenson.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.000
Got it.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.500
Laura's late husband

09:23.600 --> 09:27.000
founded the Lyndhurst
Land and Lease Company.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.500
You may have seen
thbillboards.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.400
Okay.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.300
She really can't hear
anything we're saying?

09:32.400 --> 09:33.200
No.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.800
No, she really can't.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.600
Okay, well,

09:36.900 --> 09:38.900
the, uh, Swensons'
family attorney

09:38.900 --> 09:40.400
is an old friend of mine,

09:40.500 --> 09:42.200
and he's hired me
to work the point

09:42.300 --> 09:45.400
and negotiate
any and all discussions

09:45.400 --> 09:49.100
with the kidnappers
as we work to get Nicole back.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.300
What about the police?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.600
We don't want
the police involved.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.700
The family
was given very strict

09:56.700 --> 09:58.700
instructions by the kidnappers.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.500
Listen, I-I can't
do this anymore.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
I've got to get back
to the Swensons.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.000
How about I talk to you,
and you talk to her?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Okay.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.800
So Allison says she saw the men

10:13.800 --> 10:15.100
wearing masks.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.200
That's what
she said, yeah.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.400
Tell her
that's good.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.500
Tell her
that's very good.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.000
That if, in fact, they're
purposely hiding their identity

10:22.100 --> 10:23.100
from the girl,

10:23.400 --> 10:25.300
it means they probably
don't want to kill her,

10:25.300 --> 10:26.900
that they're ready
to hand her back alive

10:27.000 --> 10:28.400
as soon as theget their money.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.700
Okay.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.200
Tell her also
that it's very useful

10:32.200 --> 10:35.600
to know that they're
communicating in sign language.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.000
Th would suggest
that it wasn't really

10:38.000 --> 10:39.700
a crime of opportunity.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.800
It was very
well planned.

10:41.900 --> 10:42.900
They don't want to hurt r.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.200
They, they just
want their money.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.300
Okay.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.000
All of this

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
will be very important
once we start our negotiations

10:51.900 --> 10:53.000
with the

10:53.000 --> 10:54.300
Thank you.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.600
Mr. Dubois, uh, would you
please l me know

10:58.600 --> 11:00.100
if Allison gets any more...

11:00.300 --> 11:02.000
particulars?
Absolutely.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.000
I've got to go

11:03.100 --> 11:04.600
to the house now.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.400
What did she say?

11:09.700 --> 11:12.300
I feel a really bad case
of carpal tunnel coming on.

11:28.100 --> 11:28.700
Testing.

11:28.700 --> 11:29.200
Testing, testing.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.800
But I don't understand.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.100
I'm, I'm asking you

11:32.100 --> 11:33.400
a simple question.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.100
Well, please connect me
with somebody who can.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.000
Watch your tone. Just...

11:39.000 --> 11:39.800
Who's he talking to?

11:39.900 --> 11:40.800
I'm on hold.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.200
It's the insurance company.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.300
Mr. Swenson, wou you
please hang up that phone.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.200
When I'm finished.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.100
We have a kidnapping
and ransom policy.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.400
Now they're telling me
they won't give us theoney.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.400
Well, of course not.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
That not how insurance works.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.100
They only reimburse <i>after</i>
the ransom has been paid.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.000
Now, please, Mr. Swenson,
will you hang up that phone?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.200
They can't help you.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.400
The fewer people who knoabout

12:01.400 --> 12:03.900
your daughter's kidnapping,
the better right now.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.100
Come on.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.300
Let's... Let's sit down.

12:10.000 --> 12:10.900
I don't understand.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.200
What are we gonna do?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.600
We're gonna do
whatever we need to do.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.300
Now, I know this is difficult,
but you have to think about this

12:18.300 --> 12:20.200
as a business
negotiation.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.900
You haveomething
they want.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.600
They have something
you want.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.100
We want to resolve this
as quickly as possible

12:26.200 --> 12:27.400
without anyone getting hurt.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
But that's what I mean.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.900
What they want, I don't have.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.100
I don't have five
million dollars.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.500
Not just lying around waing
to get thrown into a duffel bag.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.200
We will find it.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.800
We're, we're talking
to the banks.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.900
We'll remortgage the house.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.300
That's why we have Cyrus.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.600
That is what he's
good at. Tell him.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.800
Unfortunately, Darrin
has already given you

12:48.800 --> 12:51.900
a fairly accurate assessment
of our situation.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.700
With the banks...

12:53.900 --> 12:55.000
With the mortgage...

12:55.200 --> 12:56.000
I think the st cas

12:56.000 --> 12:57.700
we can put together
before day's end

12:57.700 --> 12:59.000
is somewhere in the neighborhood

12:59.000 --> 13:01.100
of three to three
and a half million.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.800
I mean, if I had more time...

13:03.400 --> 13:05.000
We'll offer them three million.

13:05.700 --> 13:08.000
Weren't you on the same
phone call that I was?

13:08.200 --> 13:09.500
They want five.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.500
We have three.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.600
I don't believe
they're gonna find

13:11.600 --> 13:13.400
a buyer who has more.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.100
How can you be sure?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
How can <i>you</i> be sure

13:18.100 --> 13:20.000
that they won't do something...

13:20.700 --> 13:22.400
awful?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.900
???

13:24.900 --> 13:26.800
I mean, there wouldn't
be an upside to it.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.200
There's no profit
to be made from it.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.300
For the men who took Nicole,
this is just a business venture.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.000
and three million dollarC..

13:38.500 --> 13:40.300
is an ful lot of money.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.100
Now, when they call,

13:43.400 --> 13:44.700
I'm gonna talk
to them.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.300
Trust me.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.000
This will work out.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.200
MARIE:
 <i>Mommy.</i>

13:51.200 --> 13:54.200
Mommy. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

14:02.700 --> 14:03.900
She can't hear you.

14:04.300 --> 14:05.700
Come on. I'll
read you the book.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.600
I want Mommy to read it.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.100
But she can't. I'll
do it though, okay?

14:11.300 --> 14:11.900
Okay.

14:11.900 --> 14:12.700
Okay, let's go.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.000
Hey.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.900
"Is your mama a llama?"

14:27.100 --> 14:28.500
ARIEL:There we go.

14:28.500 --> 14:28.900
MARIE:
Okay.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.800
??? ALLISON:
Can I do that?

14:35.000 --> 14:35.900
Okay.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.300
"Is your mama a llama?"

14:38.400 --> 14:40.700
You guys
are reading.

14:40.700 --> 14:41.800
I can do that.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.200
"'Is your mama a llama?'

14:52.300 --> 14:56.300
"I asked my friend Dave.

14:56.500 --> 15:01.400
"'No, she is not,' is
the answer Dave gave."

15:49.700 --> 15:51.100
What are you doing?

15:51.100 --> 15:52.300
You're calling Cindy?

15:52.300 --> 15:53.800
You can't call anybody.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.600
You're not gonna be
able to hear them.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.800
Cynthia Keen. We have
to call Cynthia Keener.
Why?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.100
It's the middle
of the night.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.400
All ri Nev ???

16:07.300 --> 16:09.200
The place where
the video was shot,

16:09.200 --> 16:12.100
it had a very rustic
feeling to it.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.800
like a... like a cabin
in the mountains.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.200
AnI also saw

16:16.200 --> 16:17.800
a glass, a water glass,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.300
and on it was printed

16:19.800 --> 16:21.400
the name of a local diner.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.900
Well, I saw a video
about an hour ago,

16:25.900 --> 16:28.000
but I didn'tsee any 

16:30.600 --> 16:32.600
Well, I'm not sure it was
actually in the video.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.100
I think they realized...

16:36.100 --> 16:37.200
you could see it.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.200
One of the kidnappers

16:38.200 --> 16:39.200
pulled it off the table

16:39.300 --> 16:41.500
before they started cording.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.900
It sd "Mano's Diner."

16:44.100 --> 16:44.700
We looked it up online.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.600
A Mano's Diner is in
the White Tank Mountains,

16:47.700 --> 16:48.800
just outside of Phoenix.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.600
The White Tank Mountains.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.100
Hmm.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.200
Well, that's the first
real clue we've had

16:55.200 --> 16:57.000
since this whole
thing began.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.800
Well, I mean, the glass
doesn't actually guarantee

16:58.800 --> 17:00.300
that they're somewhere
near the diner.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.200
ll, still,
it's a's a good start.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.099
She's quite amazing.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.000
(loudly):
Would you-- would you like
to stay with me today?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.900
???

17:17.300 --> 17:21.000
I would like for you
to stay with me today.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.200
CYNTHIA:
 <i>Laura,</i>

17:22.200 --> 17:23.099
Darrin.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.500
This is Allison.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.800
Allison's an investigator
I work with.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.700
She, uh, has reviewed
the ransom tape

17:37.000 --> 17:38.900
and has some
pretty strong ideas

17:38.900 --> 17:40.700
about where it might
have been shot.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.600
Oh, my goodness.
Well,

17:42.600 --> 17:45.800
it's, uh, it's not a certainty,
but Allison feels

17:45.800 --> 17:48.100
that your daughter might be
in the White Tank Mountains

17:48.100 --> 17:49.200
not far
from here.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.200
Excellent.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.500
So, uh, what do we do?

17:53.200 --> 17:55.800
Well, I'm about to sq裠
some people up there right now.

17:56.300 --> 17:59.100
Uh, we're going to work
as many angles as possible,

17:59.100 --> 18:01.100
gather as much
information as we can,

18:01.100 --> 18:03.000
and continue to negotiate.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.300
Thank you. It's, it's,

18:05.300 --> 18:07.200
it's just such
a comfort...

18:12.400 --> 18:14.600
Um, Allison is profoundly deaf.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.900
It's one of the reasons she
feels such a strong connection

18:17.900 --> 18:18.900
to Nicole

18:19.300 --> 18:23.200
and why she's been working so
hard on this particular case.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.800
I know we forfeit interest
by cashing in now,

18:39.800 --> 18:41.700
but I need access
to those funds.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.500
That could be them.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.800
Is everyone ready?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.300
Swenson resince.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.300
(electronically altered):
Who is this?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.600
Gentlemen,
this is Cynthia Keener,

18:58.200 --> 18:59.500
just like the last time.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.200
I need to talk to the Swensons.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.500
I'm sorry.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.500
Uh, I thought

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
I'd already
explained to you

19:04.600 --> 19:07.000
that that's just
not going to happen.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.300
We very much
want Nicole back

19:09.300 --> 19:12.600
and, uh, we're very anxious
to get this whole thing moving,

19:13.100 --> 19:15.100
but you are going to
have to deal with me.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.600
And how can we be sure
you're not the police?

19:17.600 --> 19:20.100
You're jusgoing to have
to take my word for it.

19:20.700 --> 19:24.000
Again, all I'm interested in
is getting you your money

19:24.000 --> 19:26.300
and getting the Swensons
their daughter bk.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.500
Now, uh, we've seen your tape.
We believe you have her.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.900
How do we move
this thing along?

19:33.200 --> 19:34.800
You have the money?

19:34.800 --> 19:35.700
We do.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.200
$5 million?

19:37.200 --> 19:38.600
Three, we have $3 million.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.000
But the price is five.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Well, I understand
the price is five

19:42.000 --> 19:44.100
and I'm lling you
all we have is three.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.000
You justive us
Nicole back

19:47.000 --> 19:49.100
and we'll give you
$3 million.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.700
(whispering):
Tell them we'll give them
the money.

19:55.700 --> 19:56.900
W-We'll figure out a way.

19:56.900 --> 19:57.700
We just need a few more days.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.700
No, no.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.300
Gentlemen?

20:03.800 --> 20:06.400
Gentlemen,
we-we're not hearing anything.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.900
Gentlemen?

20:09.100 --> 20:10.100
Five.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.200
Three.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.100
I'm offering you
what the Swensons have

20:15.200 --> 20:17.200
and what they have
is $3 million.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Cash.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.000
(phone clicks)
Hello?

20:21.600 --> 20:22.400
ial tone)
Hello?

20:22.400 --> 20:23.200
They're gone.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.800
You're fired.
Excuse me?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.000
I told you.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.400
We can get them
their money.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.100
But we have no more time.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.800
Every second that you
alw your daughter

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
to spend with
these people,

20:35.800 --> 20:37.800
you put her further
and further in peril

20:38.100 --> 20:40.700
Now, truste, they
want to make a deal.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.400
They want to give you
your daughter back

20:42.400 --> 20:43.800
and they want their money.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.000
They want the
same thing you do.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.000
$3 million or $5 million,

20:48.300 --> 20:51.500
they want what you want:
they want this to be over.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.700
Did you get
anything?

20:55.100 --> 20:56.100
No.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.900
They're going to call back.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.500
How can you be so sure?

21:00.700 --> 21:02.400
Well, like I told you before,

21:02.900 --> 21:04.900
it's not as if there's
another buyer out there.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.500
They're going to call back.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.800
Well, I hope you're right.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.100
I hope you know
what you're doing

21:12.800 --> 21:15.400
because if anything happens
to our Nicole...

21:16.700 --> 21:20.200
??? 

22:15.000 --> 22:17.400
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DEAF VERY LONG, HAVE YOU?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.200
Swenson residence.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.800
MAN (voice distorted):
We'll take the $3 million.

22:35.200 --> 22:35.900
Get it ready.
(sighs)

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
(sobs)
It is ready.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.700
Where do I meet you?

22:39.900 --> 22:42.000
Not you. Have the father
bring us the money.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.300
I'm sorry.
He's not available to do that.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.200
I'll, uh,
I'll be bringing the money.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.100
Well, then I'm sorry,

22:49.100 --> 22:51.600
but his little girl won't be
available to be returned.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.900
Either the father brings the
money or there's no exchange.

22:55.700 --> 22:56.500
Listen tme...

22:56.500 --> 22:58.500
No, listen to me.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.600
I'll be calling back
with final instructions shortly.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.100
At that time, I need
the father to bring the money.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.700
I will be watching.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.700
If the father is followed
by police, by you,

23:08.900 --> 23:10.300
there'll be no exchange.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.100
You'll find nothing.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.800
You'll find no one

23:13.800 --> 23:15.300
just the corpse.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.700
Cyrus,

23:20.700 --> 23:21.800
get the money ready.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.900
I'm going to need an armed team

23:22.900 --> 23:24.400
to follow Mr. Swenson
to the drop.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.800
Lady, you follow me,

23:27.200 --> 23:30.000
you order anybody
to follow me,

23:30.700 --> 23:33.500
I'll come back here
and I'll kill you.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.600
Mr. Swenson...
Or shall I kill
you now?!

23:39.200 --> 23:41.300
Cyrus, where are we
with that money?

23:49.100 --> 23:50.600
MR. SWENSON:
 <i>It's two hours.</i>

23:51.000 --> 23:53.100
What could be taking them
so long?

24:03.400 --> 24:07.000
GIRLS IN BED LUV U GOODNIGHT

24:08.400 --> 24:09.900
Mmm.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.300
Oh, I'm not sure

24:13.300 --> 24:16.000
if you've actually answered
the phone yet or not.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.500
Actually, I'm not even sure

24:17.500 --> 24:20.600
if the phone's finished ringing
yet or not.

24:23.100 --> 24:25.200
I miss your voice.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.600
I miss the girls' voices.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.300
The sound of the house
in the morning.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.600
The way that you sigh
when you roll over in bed.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.800
Sorry I'm not there.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.300
Honestly, I'm not really sure
what good I'm doing here.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.100
???

24:54.700 --> 24:57.200
I know that I am not easy.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.100
But I do love you

25:01.500 --> 25:04.600
and I hope you still love me.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.600
Anyway, if you're there...

25:13.700 --> 25:14.800
sweet dreams.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.400
Sleep tight.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.900
And know that I love you.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.300
And if you're not there...

25:24.700 --> 25:26.900
...sweet dreams.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.600
Sleep tight.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.900
And know that love you.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.100
Hi.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.400
Allison.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.000
She saw one of them.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.400
One of the kidnappers.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.900
She can identify him
and he knows it.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.400
They're going to have
to kill her now, aren't they?

26:52.800 --> 26:54.100
Mrs. Swenson...

26:56.000 --> 26:57.300
I need your help.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.400
I need you to convince
your husband

27:01.400 --> 27:03.100
to let me call
the police.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.600
What, what are you
talking about?

27:07.400 --> 27:08.600
They said no police.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.500
That's...
that's what we agreed on.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.800
That's what we promised.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.600
I have new information.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.300
???

27:19.600 --> 27:20.900
It's her, isn't it?

27:22.900 --> 27:24.500
You, you told us
her first name,

27:24.500 --> 27:26.800
but you never told us
helast.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.100
It's Dubois, isn't it?

27:34.300 --> 27:36.000
What does she know?

27:40.500 --> 27:43.500
She thinks your daughter
may be in serious danger.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.700
Now, we havepeople

27:46.700 --> 27:49.800
the White Tank area
for this cabin.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.400
But with police help,

27:52.500 --> 27:55.300
we have a much
better chance
of finding her.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
??? changing the plan.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.100
Are you insane?

28:09.700 --> 28:11.100
We're almost there.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.000
We're one call away

28:13.000 --> 28:15.700
and now you want
to double-cross them?

28:16.600 --> 28:18.900
Now u want to give
them a reason

28:19.500 --> 28:21.100
to kill our little girl?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.200
I fear they already
have a reason.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.100
What are you talking about?

28:26.800 --> 28:28.700
What is she talking about?

28:30.300 --> 28:31.300
That's it.

28:32.300 --> 28:33.800
I'm going to the bedroom.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.400
I'm going to try and sleep.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.700
And when
that phone rings,

28:38.700 --> 28:41.300
I'm doing whatever
those people tell .

28:42.300 --> 28:45.300
I'm going wherever
they want me to.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.200
And I am bringing
my daughter ba.

28:50.300 --> 28:53.300
Mrs. Swenson,
I beg of you.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.900
Please let us
call the police.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.600
Otherwise, I fear
we're compromising

28:57.600 --> 28:59.400
your daughter's
safe return.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.100
How dareou?

29:01.100 --> 29:03.100
This is not your child.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.500
This is our child.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.100
Darrin, Darrin...

29:08.300 --> 29:09.600
Mrs. Swenson,

29:10.200 --> 29:12.100
ishis what
you want?

29:14.800 --> 29:16.600
She's my baby.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.500
I... I d... I don't know you.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.500
I don't know
this woman.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.900
They said no police.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.100
And we'll be...

29:36.100 --> 29:38.000
We're almost there, right?

29:39.300 --> 29:41.400
We're almost there, honey.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.700
Come on.

29:44.300 --> 29:45.900
Let's go to bed.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.600
They'll come for us
when the phone rings.

30:29.900 --> 30:31.000
I heard...

30:31.000 --> 30:32.200
u had a dream.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.400
Maybe saw some,
some bad guys?

30:37.800 --> 30:39.500
Want to go look
at some pictures

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Maybe see if you
recognize anyone?

30:45.100 --> 30:46.300
CYRUS:
Exactly three million.

30:46.300 --> 30:47.200
One million a bag.

30:48.100 --> 30:49.300
Thank you, Cyrus.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.300
I don't understand
why it is taking them so long

30:52.300 --> 30:53.500
to call back.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.400
They like this.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.400
Right.
They like
that wre anxious.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.200
Mr. and Mrs.
Swenson...

31:00.100 --> 31:02.100
omething I'd like
to propose to you.

31:02.100 --> 31:04.100
I just got a phone call
from my office.

31:04.100 --> 31:07.200
They have a small, electroc
portable beacon

31:07.200 --> 31:09.600
that they can have
over here in ten minutes.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.700
It's tiny.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.700
It fits in the wheel well
of your car and...

31:13.900 --> 31:17.200
it can give us your location
if anything should go wrong.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.200
I can't risk it.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.900
I won't risk it.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.200
But, Mr. Swenson,
they'll never know it's there.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.900
Looks like
it's a moot point.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.100
I'll handle this from here.
Thank you.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.800
Hello, this
is Nicole's father.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.100
MAN (voice distorted):
Is the money ready?

31:37.400 --> 31:39.700
Yes. It's ready.
It's completely ready.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.600
Then it looks like you're going
to get your daughter back today.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.500
Oh, thank God.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.400
I need you to follow
my instructions precisely.

31:44.700 --> 31:45.800
Do you have a pen and paper?

31:45.800 --> 31:47.700
Yes. Yes, I'm ready.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.800
Drive to Deer Valley Park.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.600
At the corr of 19th and
Landale, y'll find a trash can

31:52.600 --> 31:54.900
near鏷e southernmost swing set
on the playground.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.100
Okay.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.100
Right on top will be
a white paper bag,

31:58.100 --> 32:00.600
and in the white paper bag
you'll find a cell phone.

32:02.300 --> 32:03.800
Okay. What then?

32:07.800 --> 32:08.900
Mr. Swenson.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.200
When you
retrieve

32:10.200 --> 32:11.100
the white paper bag--

32:11.100 --> 32:12.100
I'll give you gloves.

32:12.100 --> 32:13.300
???

32:13.300 --> 32:15.300
It may contain
forensic evidence

32:15.300 --> 32:17.900
that will help us find
the men who did this.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.800
Don't you understand?

32:23.900 --> 32:27.200
I don't care
about the men who did this.

32:27.300 --> 32:30.100
None of us care
about the men who did this.

32:30.100 --> 32:33.800
I'm not going to that
garbage can wearing gloves.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.600
What if they're
watching me?

32:35.600 --> 32:36.800
No.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.600
I just want my daughter back.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.200
Oh... bring her back to me.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.800
You bring her back to me.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.400
You know I will.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.800
It's almost over.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.600
I can feel it.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.200
Mrs. Swenson...

33:09.200 --> 33:12.500
I'm so sorry
if me and my people

33:12.500 --> 33:14.200
have made this
harder for you.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.400
But, uh, quite
honestly,

33:20.100 --> 33:22.100
I've never worked
with a man as...

33:22.400 --> 33:24.200
determined
as your husband.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.900
He just wants it over.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.900
We... We just want it over.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.900
I guess now
we just wait.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.600
I'm going
for some air.

33:41.100 --> 33:41.700
Keener.

33:41.700 --> 33:42.700
We got a winner.

33:42.700 --> 33:43.700
Pardon me?

33:43.800 --> 33:45.500
She's looked through
six books of mug sho5v

33:45.500 --> 33:46.500
and she finally found the guy.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.800
If you've got a computer there,
I can e-mail him over to you.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.100
That's terrific.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.400
Is she sure?
Is she really sure?

33:53.500 --> 33:55.700
You want to know she's sure,
hold on a second.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.700
Cynthia, it's him.

34:00.700 --> 34:03.000
CYNTHIA:
Do either of you
recognize this man?

34:03.000 --> 34:03.900
No.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.500
There is something
familiar about him.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.600
His name is David Barrington.

34:11.699 --> 34:14.100
???

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
Coincidentally,
Mrs. Swenson,

34:16.800 --> 34:20.300
he worked for your husband
for several months last year.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.699
Oh, my gosh.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.500
Wait aute,
What...

34:24.300 --> 34:25.199
What a you saying?

34:26.400 --> 34:27.600
Are you saying

34:27.600 --> 34:29.800
this is an inside job?

34:30.199 --> 34:34.699
That someone who worked
fo husband betrayed him?

34:34.900 --> 34:35.900
Maybe.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.600
Maybe he still works for him.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.300
Cynthia, I'm the one who
brought you in on this.

34:42.300 --> 34:44.199
I've always been in
your corner, but now...

34:44.199 --> 34:46.000
My husband was right about you.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.699
What you're saying,
it doesn't make any sense.

34:48.699 --> 34:52.300
Why? Whyould he hire someone
to kidnap his own stepdaughter?

34:52.300 --> 34:53.400
I don't know.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.699
Maybe he's planning
to use the ransom money--

34:55.699 --> 34:58.200
minus what he's giving
to the kidnappers--

34:58.200 --> 35:01.300
to cover all
the shortfalls at work.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.700
What-What shortfalls?

35:03.700 --> 35:05.500
The coany is doing fine.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.300
That's not what Cyrus told me
when he hired me.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.300
He didn't want
you to know.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.600
Since Darrin's been
running things,

35:15.600 --> 35:17.300
he's taken a lot
more risks.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.400
The company's accumulated
a grt deal of debt.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.000
It-It still...
It doesn't make any sense.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.500
???

35:33.700 --> 35:34.900
For the moment.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.500
Until you're reimbursed

35:36.500 --> 35:39.800
through that insurance policy
he made sure you had.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.100
My, uh...

35:59.000 --> 36:00.900
My dad had a...

36:02.300 --> 36:07.200
a hunting cabin...
in the mountains.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.900
No one's
used it in...

36:09.900 --> 36:11.800
in years.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.400
He won't be there.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.200
(sobbing):
You're-You're wrong.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.400
You are so wrong.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.500
Give me the address.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.400
Let me prove you right.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.500
Well, well.
The man with the plan.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.200
Where is she?

36:40.500 --> 36:41.600
She's in the other room.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.200
She can't hear anything.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.800
Yeah, let's get
this over with.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.900
As promised,
one million dollars.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.300
It's all there.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.700
Hey, come on, man.
You know where I live.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.500
Listen,
if I were you two?

37:02.500 --> 37:04.300
I would get the hell
out of here now.

37:04.700 --> 37:05.900
In fact,
I'll tell you what.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.600
I'll wait ten minutes
before I go in and get Nicole.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.400
That way there's absolutely
no chance she'll see you two.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.400
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
worry about that.

37:13.700 --> 37:14.900
She already has.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.400
What are you talking about?

37:18.700 --> 37:20.600
Well, it was a bit
of an accident.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.700
Yo daughter hurt herself.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.300
She screamed.

37:23.300 --> 37:27.300
I ran inside, but...
I wasn't wearing my mask.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.300
She saw your face?

37:32.600 --> 37:33.900
Wait a second.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.000
What are we going to do?

37:37.800 --> 37:40.900
???

37:42.900 --> 37:44.500
I told her aut you.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.800
I told her how this
was all your doing.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.100
Your idea.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.200
Well, I didn't <i>tell</i> her.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.100
Wrote it out.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.400
How can you do this to me?

38:04.900 --> 38:06.200
Do you know what this means?

38:06.200 --> 38:08.400
This means I can't
take her home.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.800
We dug you a hole out back.

38:42.600 --> 38:43.600
Nicole...

38:47.000 --> 38:48.500
I am so sorry.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.200
Come on.
(screams)

38:52.000 --> 38:52.900
Come on.
(screaming)

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
Come on, Nicole.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.800
Nicole! Stop it!

39:02.600 --> 39:04.100
Just so you know...

39:04.200 --> 39:05.400
it would give me
enormous pleasure

39:05.400 --> 39:07.200
to put one of these
right between your eyes

39:07.200 --> 39:09.700
and another through
the center of your chest.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.000
Fine. Deny a woman
a little happiness.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.500
NTHIA:
Mrs. Swenson?

40:40.700 --> 40:43.800
There's someone here
who'd really like to see you.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.200
Mom!

40:56.000 --> 40:57.300
I love you.

41:02.100 --> 41:02.200
(sobbing)
ARIEL:
 <i>No...</i> Is Your Mama A Llama?

41:02.200 --> 41:04.100
Can we read
about a giraffe?

41:04.100 --> 41:04.500
MARIE:
No.

41:04.500 --> 41:07.900
ARIEL:
Or... uh, the girl
in the forest?

41:07.900 --> 41:08.700
MARIE:
No.

41:10.300 --> 41:11.600
ARIEL:
Is <i>your</i> mama a llama?

41:12.100 --> 41:13.600
Is <i>my</i> mama
a llama?
(gasps)

41:13.800 --> 41:14.900
Is your mama
a llama?
(sighs)

41:14.900 --> 41:17.100
Is your mam...is
your mama a llama?

41:17.200 --> 41:18.300
No? Come here.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.500
"'Is your mama
a llama?'"...

41:20.500 --> 41:23.500
BOTH:
..."I asked my friend Dave."

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
"'No, she is not,' is
the answer Dave gave.

41:28.300 --> 41:28.400
"'No, she is not,' is
the answer Dave gave.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.400
"She hangs
by her feet

41:30.700 --> 41:33.000
"and she lives
in a cave.

41:33.700 --> 41:36.500
I do not belie
that'sow llamas behave."

41:36.500 --> 41:37.300
Mm.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.500
Mom, can you hear?

41:41.000 --> 41:41.900
Yeah.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.400
Welcome back.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.400
It's good to be back.
