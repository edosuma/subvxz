WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:03.480
The following programme
contains strong language.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.720
You can't turn back time

00:12.760 --> 00:14.880
to stop what happened to Sarah.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.640
Summer 2018?

00:17.680 --> 00:20.600
I was on a mission in summer 2018.
It didn't go well.

00:23.960 --> 00:24.000
In summer 2018,
did you reset the clock?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.640
In summer 2018,
did you reset the clock?

00:26.680 --> 00:28.960
- Yeah.
Hi.- Hi!

00:29.000 --> 00:30.840
How many times?
A lot.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.080
We have to go again,
we have to try again.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.880
The mission was successful.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.600
I remember you from Paris.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.000
Last one standing.

00:40.000 --> 00:40.120
Last one standing.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.400
Dennis Rebrov

00:41.440 --> 00:43.920
is on almost every terror
watchlist in the world.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.560
He's ex-Lazarus?
One of our brightest and best.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.000
You want to turn back time?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.040
You want to turn back time?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.360
Yes.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.600
OK...

01:27.920 --> 01:28.000
Oh! Hey, Faye.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.560
Oh! Hey, Faye.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.000
Hey.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.160
Everything all right?

01:34.200 --> 01:35.720
Everything's great.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.000
OK. People, people,
let's gather.

02:16.000 --> 02:16.720
OK. People, people,
let's gather.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.360
It's a group called The Lost Glory.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.000
They've got a name like
an impotence awareness campaign,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.640
They've got a name like
an impotence awareness campaign,

02:25.680 --> 02:26.960
but they're a serious outfit,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.680
and we believe at some point
in the next few months,

02:29.720 --> 02:32.000
they're gonna be in possession
of Big Boy.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.240
they're gonna be in possession
of Big Boy.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.040
Rebrov's confirmed they are the
group he was working with in Paris.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.160
Oh, Virgil Isaacs.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.000
Leader of the Glory since 2015.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.400
Leader of the Glory since 2015.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.960
If anyone knows where Big Boy is,
it's this man.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.200
Do we have a lead
on where they are?

02:46.240 --> 02:48.000
Well, we haven't got anything
concrete from Rebrov,

02:48.000 --> 02:48.440
Well, we haven't got anything
concrete from Rebrov,

02:48.480 --> 02:50.240
but Interpol have given us a lead

02:50.280 --> 02:52.400
on a possible base
in the Czech Republic.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.440
50 miles from Prague.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.000
So, we're going hunting.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.160
So, we're going hunting.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.440
Hey.
Hey.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.560
Look, erm, I want in on this.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.000
What, the mission?
No, you're not going.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.760
What, the mission?
No, you're not going.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.560
Oh, come on, Archie. I need this.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.080
Why? Why do you need it?
What part of joining a wet team

03:11.120 --> 03:12.000
in a scraggy bit of land
in Eastern Europe

03:12.000 --> 03:13.360
in a scraggy bit of land
in Eastern Europe

03:13.400 --> 03:15.720
to fight with terrorists
do you need right now?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.280
Er, I wanna be useful.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.000
Well, you're not useful.
Not currently. Not in the field.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.560
Well, you're not useful.
Not currently. Not in the field.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.000
Why not?

03:22.040 --> 03:25.160
What, you think cos I lost someone,
that makes me weak?

03:26.560 --> 03:28.000
I can do this.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.120
I can do this.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.440
Look I trust you, OK?
This isn't about that.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.480
But I'm not gonna rush you back.
And that is my final word on it.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.000
They're a pseudo-fascist,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.160
They're a pseudo-fascist,

03:46.760 --> 03:48.920
libertarian,

03:52.640 --> 03:56.800
free the people from the shackles
of whatever, and so on,

03:56.840 --> 03:59.080
fucking nonsense group.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.160
"The Lost Glory." Jesus.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.240
I'm offended to be working
with these people.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, well, Interpol gave us
a lead on their base,

04:08.000 --> 04:08.760
Yeah, well, Interpol gave us
a lead on their base,

04:08.800 --> 04:11.400
so pretty soon,
they won't be working with anyone.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.880
If they get wiped out, my best
chance of gettin' to Big Boy's gone.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.000
Relax. The bomb's not going
anywhere. The key is the detonator.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.640
Relax. The bomb's not going
anywhere. The key is the detonator.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.960
That's the end game--

04:26.600 --> 04:28.640
So how do I get it?

04:28.680 --> 04:31.520
I give you a contact
who can make it for you.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.000
Who?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.360
Who?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.920
Someone who's as likely
to slit your throat

04:35.960 --> 04:38.960
and bury you in an unmarked grave
as help you, but...

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I guess that's just a risk

04:40.000 --> 04:40.480
I guess that's just a risk

04:40.520 --> 04:42.480
I'm gonna have
to be willing to take.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.840
Yeah, that sounds great. What if
Lazarus get to the bomb before then?

04:46.880 --> 04:48.000
Tell The Lost Glory they're coming.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.440
Tell The Lost Glory they're coming.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.080
Well, do they have a phone number?

04:52.120 --> 04:54.080
They have a YouTube page.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.800
You're shittin' me.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.080
No.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.280
Write them a convincing message.
They'll scatter.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.240
And the detonator?

05:03.200 --> 05:04.000
Carrer de Santa Teresa,

05:04.000 --> 05:05.120
Carrer de Santa Teresa,

05:06.680 --> 05:09.120
zero, eight, zero,

05:09.160 --> 05:12.000
12, Barcelona.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.200
12, Barcelona.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.480
That's the address.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.320
When you get there,
you tell her from me,

05:21.480 --> 05:24.640
"This couldn't have gone
any other way."

06:04.480 --> 06:06.240
Sorry, it's a bit cold. Yeah.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.000
I suppose that's the worst part of
pregnancy, right? Cold tummy.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.480
I suppose that's the worst part of
pregnancy, right? Cold tummy.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.040
Until there's a medicine ball
coming out your vagina.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.640
That part's arguably worse.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.480
And how many nights will it be

06:15.520 --> 06:16.000
till the baby's sleeping through
the night, do you reckon?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.920
till the baby's sleeping through
the night, do you reckon?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.440
Week at most?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.640
Do you wanna know
what you're having?

06:22.680 --> 06:24.000
Having a real good
fucking time is what I'm having!

06:24.000 --> 06:25.480
Having a real good
fucking time is what I'm having!

06:25.520 --> 06:28.240
She talks a lot when she's nervous.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.040
What is it?

06:31.080 --> 06:32.000
A little boy.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.360
A little boy.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.000
A little boy...

06:40.000 --> 06:40.120
A little boy...

06:42.400 --> 06:44.440
Oh, wow.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.800
I don't know what to say.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.000
"Congratulations" is traditional.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.040
"Congratulations" is traditional.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.720
Fuck, Janet, you know the deal.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.720
Time your conceptions
just before the checkpoint.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.000
It's so romantic when
you put it like that. Janet...

07:04.000 --> 07:04.560
It's so romantic when
you put it like that. Janet...

07:04.600 --> 07:08.200
Archie. We didn't exactly plan it,
you know?

07:09.320 --> 07:11.560
There are reasons
these rules get put in place.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.000
Get pregnant between
January and June,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.120
Get pregnant between
January and June,

07:13.160 --> 07:15.360
and if we go back
to the previous year,

07:15.400 --> 07:17.680
the worst thing you lose
is probably a pregnancy.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.280
Get pregnant between
July and December

07:19.320 --> 07:20.000
and you could lose something
a lot worse. I know.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.920
and you could lose something
a lot worse. I know.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.040
The worst thing you lose
could be a lot worse.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.920
Firstly, I've lost
a pregnancy before,

07:26.960 --> 07:28.000
so let's not dismiss that
as no big deal, OK?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.400
so let's not dismiss that
as no big deal, OK?

07:29.440 --> 07:32.120
Secondly, don't talk to me
like I don't know the rules.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.280
I've been doing
this longer than you.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.000
I'm sorry.
It's fine.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.160
I'm sorry.
It's fine.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.800
No!

07:41.840 --> 07:44.000
So when are you due?

07:44.000 --> 07:44.480
So when are you due?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.920
Pretty much July 1st.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.640
What happens if it's early?

07:51.680 --> 07:52.000
What happens if you have your baby
before the checkpoint

07:52.000 --> 07:54.080
What happens if you have your baby
before the checkpoint

07:54.120 --> 07:55.640
and we jump back 12 months?

07:55.680 --> 07:58.560
Why not get a termination and
follow protocol? Why take the risk?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.000
This is my baby. This one.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.240
This is my baby. This one.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.480
That's all there is.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.760
No!

08:06.800 --> 08:08.000
Well, then, congratulations.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.120
Well, then, congratulations.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.000
No!

08:24.000 --> 08:24.120
No!

08:39.840 --> 08:40.000
Just going away
for a little bit, love.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.080
Just going away
for a little bit, love.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.680
Got something I need to do.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.000
I think it might all be a bit
fucking mental, to be honest, but...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.840
I think it might all be a bit
fucking mental, to be honest, but...

08:49.880 --> 08:51.160
there you are.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.760
I'm not gonna lie,
it's shit packing without you.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.000
You're gonna tell me

08:56.000 --> 08:56.840
You're gonna tell me

08:56.880 --> 09:00.240
I don't need that many T-shirts
for a weekend away.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.080
"Don't pack that size deodorant,

09:02.120 --> 09:04.000
"you'll only have to chuck it
at the airport".

09:04.000 --> 09:04.840
"you'll only have to chuck it
at the airport".

09:04.880 --> 09:08.760
What am I gonna do, blow up
the plane with my Sure Ice?

09:12.720 --> 09:16.400
Checked in online.
Printed off my boarding pass,

09:16.440 --> 09:20.000
so I'll put that in with my passport
in the front of my bag...

09:20.000 --> 09:20.480
so I'll put that in with my passport
in the front of my bag...

09:20.520 --> 09:23.000
like you always tell me...

09:32.080 --> 09:34.000
Fuckin' hell.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.800
Hello?

11:03.280 --> 11:04.000
Hello?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.680
Hello?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.360
Who are you?

11:08.400 --> 11:12.000
Rebrov sent me. He told me "This
couldn't have gone any other way."

11:12.000 --> 11:12.720
Rebrov sent me. He told me "This
couldn't have gone any other way."

11:20.800 --> 11:22.840
How much?

11:22.880 --> 11:24.440
How much what?

11:24.480 --> 11:26.720
How much trouble is he in?

11:35.800 --> 11:36.000
So we got a tip-off and picked up
some of his friends.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.400
So we got a tip-off and picked up
some of his friends.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.240
One of them gave him up.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.000
He doesn't have any friends.

11:44.000 --> 11:44.280
He doesn't have any friends.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.160
Clearly.
After the checkpoint, then.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.880
What, you know about
the checkpoints?

11:47.920 --> 11:50.080
I was in Lazarus, just like you.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.000
When? Long time ago now.
Dennis didn't mention that?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.920
When? Long time ago now.
Dennis didn't mention that?

11:53.960 --> 11:56.920
No.
What did he mention about me?

11:56.960 --> 11:59.840
That you were as likely
to slit my throat as help me.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.760
Er, look I need you to make me
a detonator.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.000
I need a--

12:08.000 --> 12:09.320
I need a--

12:10.240 --> 12:13.720
¿Me das una galleta, si us plau?

12:13.760 --> 12:15.800
Vete a jugar a tu habitación.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.600
Dennis and I haven't seen
each other for a long time.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.440
But we have a system.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.000
Phrases that we pass on to each
other with different meanings.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.080
Phrases that we pass on to each
other with different meanings.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.080
"Trust this person."
"Be wary." "Kill on sight."

12:38.360 --> 12:40.000
Different messages
that only we know.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.960
Different messages
that only we know.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.680
"This couldn't have gone
any other way."

12:43.720 --> 12:45.480
Huh.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.000
What does that mean, then?

12:48.000 --> 12:48.560
What does that mean, then?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.920
Will you stay for dinner, George?

12:58.320 --> 13:00.320
How much blood?

13:00.360 --> 13:02.960
Not much. It's just spotting.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
What's spotting? Read the fucking
leaflet and you'd know.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.680
What's spotting? Read the fucking
leaflet and you'd know.

13:05.720 --> 13:09.200
Well I haven't read the fucking
leaflet, so why don't you tell me?

13:09.240 --> 13:11.720
It's spotting! It's what
it sounds like. Spots of blood.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.000
Is it a lot? Is it too much?
I don't know, I'm not a doctor!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.520
Is it a lot? Is it too much?
I don't know, I'm not a doctor!

13:15.560 --> 13:18.640
They need to make
those damn sirens louder.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.000
It's fine. You're totally healthy,
the baby's fine.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.800
It's fine. You're totally healthy,
the baby's fine.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.400
Oh, thank God.
Are you sure?

13:30.440 --> 13:33.320
Because I think I ran over
some people on the way here.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.880
He's joking.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.000
Look, it happens sometimes,

13:36.000 --> 13:36.520
Look, it happens sometimes,

13:36.560 --> 13:39.440
and we do get a lot of
very panicked mums coming in.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.560
But you have nothing to worry
about. It's just it's, erm...

13:42.600 --> 13:44.000
a... a delicate pregnancy.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.240
a... a delicate pregnancy.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.600
But it's also a healthy one.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.800
Any more bleeding,
or any questions or concerns,

13:49.840 --> 13:51.920
always come straight back.

13:51.960 --> 13:52.000
Try not to run anyone over,
though, hm? Mmm.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.160
Try not to run anyone over,
though, hm? Mmm.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.920
I'm in position.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.480
Awaiting orders.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.000
Affirmative. We're here, Shiv.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.360
Affirmative. We're here, Shiv.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.440
What's going on?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.520
Got a tip-off that
a rogue state's planning

14:04.560 --> 14:07.040
on selling chemical weapons
to North Korea.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.000
Shiv's on the ground now.
Where have you been? Nowhere.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.640
Shiv's on the ground now.
Where have you been? Nowhere.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.320
She had a bleed.
What?

14:11.360 --> 14:13.600
Uh, it's fine. We saw the doctor.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.000
You sure?
Absolutely.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.000
- I drove very fast.
- He really did.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.640
- I drove very fast.
- He really did.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.160
You OK?
Fine.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.080
She had a bleed.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.680
She's bleeding?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.000
What's going on?
Nothing. Everything's fine.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.320
What's going on?
Nothing. Everything's fine.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.200
Janet's bleeding.
I-- I'm not. I'm fine.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.080
Everything's fine.
You went to the doctor?

14:29.120 --> 14:31.520
He said it was actually quite
common. I have leaflets.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.000
I can confirm Agent Rebrov
has leaflets, Shiv.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.120
I can confirm Agent Rebrov
has leaflets, Shiv.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.920
Any movement there?

14:36.960 --> 14:40.000
Yeah. Yeah, I've got
a car coming from the west.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.280
Yeah. Yeah, I've got
a car coming from the west.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.400
Looks like the drop-off's
happening.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.000
I've got eyes on the target.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I've got eyes on the target.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.680
Looks like he's closing the deal.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.400
Do I have a green light?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.000
Green light.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.480
Shiv, you are go for extraction.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.000
Copy that.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.480
And one last push.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.520
Really well done.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.240
That's it, push...

15:33.640 --> 15:35.880
One last push.

15:40.360 --> 15:44.000
And here's your boy!

15:44.000 --> 15:44.560
And here's your boy!

15:44.600 --> 15:47.320
Hi! Oh, hi!

15:47.840 --> 15:50.720
Oh! Oh!

15:50.760 --> 15:52.000
Hi! Oh, hey!

15:52.000 --> 15:53.680
Hi! Oh, hey!

16:09.240 --> 16:11.360
We shot the wrong man.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.960
He uses decoys. Intel fuck-up.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
What's the next move?

16:16.000 --> 16:16.520
What's the next move?

16:16.560 --> 16:19.120
We're going back out there.
There's talk on the channels

16:19.160 --> 16:21.360
that he may have made
the arms sale already.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.400
The North Koreans have the weapons?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.000
No. We think that was a decoy too.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.360
No. We think that was a decoy too.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.600
That's a lot of fucking decoys,
Shiv.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.000
I know.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.200
I know.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.160
Who has the weapons?

16:39.080 --> 16:40.000
We don't know.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.760
We don't know.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.400
Well, you need to find them.
We're working on that.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.040
I'm getting on a plane now.
I don't need you to talk about it.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.000
I need you to do it.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.880
I need you to do it.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.000
So... What's--
what's your story, then?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.680
So... What's--
what's your story, then?

16:58.720 --> 17:02.320
All I know about you is that
you have a history with Rebrov,

17:02.360 --> 17:04.000
you might wanna kill me,

17:04.000 --> 17:04.040
you might wanna kill me,

17:04.080 --> 17:07.240
and you can make detonators
for nuclear warheads.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.160
Well, what else is there?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.000
Could start with your name?
Don't wanna tell you my name.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.040
Could start with your name?
Don't wanna tell you my name.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.680
Is that little girl your daughter?
Don't wanna talk about her either.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.000
Do you have
a favourite football team?

17:20.000 --> 17:20.720
Do you have
a favourite football team?

17:20.760 --> 17:22.520
Crystal Palace.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.880
Wasn't actually expecting you
to have an answer for that one.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.280
Go Eagles.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.000
Palace? Makes sense why you
wanna blow up the planet.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.840
Palace? Makes sense why you
wanna blow up the planet.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.680
I don't wanna blow up the planet.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.720
Oh, it's just the nuclear detonator
thing suggests differently.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.000
I won't be the one pressing it.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.760
I won't be the one pressing it.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.360
That'd be you.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.000
Yeah.
Do you wanna blow the planet up?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Yeah.
Do you wanna blow the planet up?

17:46.360 --> 17:48.600
No. I just wanna turn back time.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.280
There you go, then.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.840
Your name's Janet, isn't it?

17:57.920 --> 18:00.000
Archie told me about you.
Told me what happened.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.960
Archie told me about you.
Told me what happened.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.960
I'm sure she didn't tell you
all of it.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.600
Maybe we should go out
for a walk.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.000
Take our minds off things. I don't
wanna go for a fucking walk,

18:16.000 --> 18:17.840
Take our minds off things. I don't
wanna go for a fucking walk,

18:17.880 --> 18:21.160
I wanna find out what's happening
with the arms deal.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.000
Two days. Less than that, now.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Two days. Less than that, now.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.440
This isn't a "no news is
a good news" situation, Dennis.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.000
What if they're already all dead?
If they're giving the order now?

18:32.000 --> 18:32.480
What if they're already all dead?
If they're giving the order now?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.760
I've talked to Wes,
I've talked to Archie,

18:34.800 --> 18:38.160
I've spoken to everyone and I've
told them to keep us in the loop.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.000
Less than 48 hours
till the checkpoint

18:40.000 --> 18:40.040
Less than 48 hours
till the checkpoint

18:40.080 --> 18:42.600
and there's a missing
chemical weapon out there.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.120
Keeping us informed
isn't their priority.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.560
In fact, I'd say it's
the exact opposite of that.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.520
I'll go.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.080
It's OK.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.880
Hey. I'm right here. Oh!

19:15.640 --> 19:18.360
In the end,
it wasn't Lazarus that told us.

19:22.560 --> 19:26.360
It was a contact
of Dennis's at the CIA.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.000
He'd picked up wire reports
of a detonation in China.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.600
He'd picked up wire reports
of a detonation in China.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.840
We were just...

19:41.880 --> 19:44.000
hours from the checkpoint.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.680
hours from the checkpoint.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.000
Hours from our son being safe.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.240
Hours from our son being safe.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.160
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.480
Shh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.000
I'm not sure you should be here.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.760
I'm not sure you should be here.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.840
What's going on? There was
a chemical weapons attack.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.280
No, that's just countryside,
that's a rural area.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.000
It's a Chinese military compound.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.600
Well, what are the casualty
reports? What's Beijing saying?

20:34.640 --> 20:37.520
Their fleet have been made
attack ready.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.880
No one's claimed credit for it.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.000
We've intercepted communications

20:40.000 --> 20:41.880
We've intercepted communications

20:41.920 --> 20:43.480
between the Russians
and the Chinese.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.240
They're blaming the Americans.
They can't substantiate that.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.000
They don't have to.
The wheels are already in motion.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.480
They don't have to.
The wheels are already in motion.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.320
This is ridiculous.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.000
It's a Code Black.
I'm authorising us to go back.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.960
It's a Code Black.
I'm authorising us to go back.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.000
Wes, we don't know how
it's going to pan out.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.920
Wes, we don't know how
it's going to pan out.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.920
No. And we don't have the time
to wait and see.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.000
Please, please, please.
Wes, Wes, please. It's too risky.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.960
Please, please, please.
Wes, Wes, please. It's too risky.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.080
I'm sorry. Faye, make the call.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.120
Look at him. Look at him.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.000
Ohh...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.400
Ohh...

21:29.440 --> 21:30.960
Look at him.
Oh...

21:31.000 --> 21:32.360
Look.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.000
You're killing him.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.240
You don't know how this
is going to play out.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.880
There's no evidence
linking this to the Americans.

21:43.920 --> 21:44.000
This is... this is just
Chinese posturing.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.520
This is... this is just
Chinese posturing.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.280
We can use diplomatic channels.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.000
If I had a week, yes. Even if
I had a few days. But I don't.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.600
If I had a week, yes. Even if
I had a few days. But I don't.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.760
I don't even have a day.
I've hours left,

21:56.800 --> 22:00.000
and the Chinese are making
all the wrong kinds of noises,

22:00.000 --> 22:00.120
and the Chinese are making
all the wrong kinds of noises,

22:00.160 --> 22:03.840
and our window of opportunity
to undo this is vanishing.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.360
I don't have a choice.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.000
Faye. Make the call.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.960
Faye. Make the call.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.600
Please don't do this. Please,
please, please don't do this!

22:11.640 --> 22:13.680
Wes...

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Please, please, please,
please don't do this.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.960
Please, please, please,
please don't do this.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.600
Get back to work!
Jesus fucking Christ.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.000
Jesus fucking Christ! Please,
please, please, please, please...

22:24.000 --> 22:24.560
Jesus fucking Christ! Please,
please, please, please, please...

22:24.600 --> 22:27.440
Please!

22:29.560 --> 22:32.000
Ple...

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Ple...

23:47.520 --> 23:50.000
I want to have a funeral for him.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.680
Other mothers get that, don't they?

23:55.680 --> 23:59.000
When their baby dies,
they get to have a funeral.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.040
I didn't know what to...

24:22.240 --> 24:24.000
We tracked down the buyers, but--

24:24.040 --> 24:26.040
I don't need a debrief,
Shiv.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.840
All the intel pointed to that man
being the target.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.000
There was no way to know that...

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
There was no way to know that...

24:34.680 --> 24:37.960
Fuck, I am so fucking sorry.
Yeah.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.560
People keep saying that to us.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.040
Fucking hell...

24:52.040 --> 24:53.760
That wasn't the end of it.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.280
Not by a long shot.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.960
You can sleep on the sofa.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.000
Tomorrow, I'll start work.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.520
Tomorrow, I'll start work.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Lima units approaching
the compound. ETA 20 minutes.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.360
Lima units approaching
the compound. ETA 20 minutes.

25:52.920 --> 25:55.120
Stand by, Lima four-two.
Hold your position.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.920
George seem OK to you?

25:56.960 --> 26:00.000
Better than he was.
That's what concerns me.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.240
Better than he was.
That's what concerns me.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.120
Pretty keen to come
on this mission, wasn't he?

26:03.160 --> 26:05.200
He just wants to be useful.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.760
What? You know what.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.000
This guy was in an office making
shitty phone apps a year ago.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.120
This guy was in an office making
shitty phone apps a year ago.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.960
Now he thinks he's James fucking
Bond, his girlfriend's dead,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
he's screaming to join a mission
he's totally ill-equipped for.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.200
he's screaming to join a mission
he's totally ill-equipped for.

26:17.240 --> 26:20.480
He wasn't ready for Paris, he
isn't ready for this. None of it.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.440
Tell me if I'm wrong.
I think you're wrong.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.000
Well, I hope so.
Lima four-two, go.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.160
Well, I hope so.
Lima four-two, go.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.160
Oh. They left in a hurry.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.560
Someone must have told them
we were coming.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.080
Found something.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.440
Might not be a wasted trip.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.720
I lost a baby too.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.880
It wasn't the same, but...

27:16.920 --> 27:19.720
It wasn't born or anything, but...

27:21.760 --> 27:23.800
It was...

27:24.560 --> 27:26.200
It's OK.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.760
How do you know how to do that?

27:35.400 --> 27:36.000
I went to night classes.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.880
I went to night classes.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.200
I'm good with machines.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.000
Good at understanding
how things work.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.960
Good at understanding
how things work.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.560
Do you know how the time loops work?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.000
I've got an idea.
And?

27:52.040 --> 27:54.040
I hope I'm wrong.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.480
Why are you helping me?
Because I owe Dennis.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.800
And because,

28:08.240 --> 28:09.960
even though he's not perfect,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.480
he deserves better than being
stuck in a Lazarus cell.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.200
He wants to destroy the world.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.000
He doesn't want
to destroy the world.

28:16.000 --> 28:16.800
He doesn't want
to destroy the world.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.840
He's hurting.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.400
People lash out when they hurt.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.920
I went to the doctor.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.720
It worked.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm pregnant.

28:40.000 --> 28:40.560
I'm pregnant.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.720
How's he looking?

29:05.760 --> 29:08.560
Everything's exactly
right. Except your pronouns.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.000
You're having a girl.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.760
You're having a girl.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.680
A girl?
Mm-hm.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.920
Would you like a copy?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.840
Erm...

29:36.560 --> 29:39.160
We've made it.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.240
Here we go, my love.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.120
There we are.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.080
Hey!

30:28.120 --> 30:30.280
Welcome home, little one.

30:50.640 --> 30:54.040
I take it you're not
drawing a pension from Lazarus?

30:54.080 --> 30:56.000
No.
How do you get by?

30:56.000 --> 30:56.800
No.
How do you get by?

30:56.840 --> 30:59.000
We manage.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.560
This is nice. It's nice
to get out of the house.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.000
Take a break from the nuclear
detonator for a bit.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.600
Take a break from the nuclear
detonator for a bit.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.000
You like to make a joke of things,
don't you?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
You like to make a joke of things,
don't you?

31:13.040 --> 31:15.200
Yeah. I guess.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.880
You remind me of him. Of Rebrov?

31:19.760 --> 31:20.000
Doesn't seem like the joking kind.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.920
Doesn't seem like the joking kind.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.040
Oh, he used to be very funny.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.240
Fuck, I used to be funny.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.000
Hey, you know how you said
you two have phrases

31:28.000 --> 31:30.520
Hey, you know how you said
you two have phrases

31:30.560 --> 31:34.080
that you'd give to people to let
you know if they could be trusted?

31:34.120 --> 31:36.000
What phrase would Rebrov
have had to plant on me

31:36.000 --> 31:38.040
What phrase would Rebrov
have had to plant on me

31:38.080 --> 31:41.360
to make you, like,
kill me on the spot?

31:42.760 --> 31:44.000
"Big plans are afoot."

31:44.000 --> 31:44.760
"Big plans are afoot."

31:46.120 --> 31:48.520
And then...
what, you would have just--

31:48.560 --> 31:51.040
Beaten you to death
with a saucepan.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.560
Ouch.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.080
Archie.

32:34.680 --> 32:38.280
A fighter jet got shot down and the
Modeen are being blamed for it.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.000
Ah. They think it could snowball
into something if we don't step in.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.880
Ah. They think it could snowball
into something if we don't step in.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.480
No one told me.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.280
We don't think it's gonna
be a big deal.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.000
You're not keeping me out the loop,
are you, Archie?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.360
You're not keeping me out the loop,
are you, Archie?

32:51.600 --> 32:53.640
No.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.000
How's the little one?
Good.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.440
How's the little one?
Good.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.160
And Janet?
Fine.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.400
You'll tell her I'm thinking
of her?

33:03.440 --> 33:04.000
We miss her.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.080
We miss her.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.400
I'll tell her.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.360
There's been a problem.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.000
What kind of problem?

33:36.040 --> 33:38.120
Things are escalating here.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.760
There's talk of a missile strike.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.200
Is it--

33:42.240 --> 33:44.000
It's a Code Black, Dennis.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.800
It's a Code Black, Dennis.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.840
You need to talk to Janet.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.720
Well done. That's it, well done.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.120
That's it, my love.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.360
Hello again, kiddo.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.000
Sorry about that.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.240
Sorry about that.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.000
I was thinkin', by the way.
I want you to move in with me.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.400
I was thinkin', by the way.
I want you to move in with me.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.440
That's it.

34:43.680 --> 34:45.560
She's called Sarah.

34:50.720 --> 34:54.680
There we go,
there we go, well done.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.280
What the fuck's goin' on?

35:06.320 --> 35:08.680
They're trying everything they can,
I promise.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.720
They're not tryin' hard enough!

35:10.760 --> 35:12.000
And one last push...

35:12.000 --> 35:12.480
And one last push...

35:12.520 --> 35:15.320
They told me I had a gift.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.360
That I could use it for good.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.000
But it's not a gift,
it's a fucking nightmare.

35:20.000 --> 35:20.280
But it's not a gift,
it's a fucking nightmare.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.320
And as I went back...

35:28.320 --> 35:30.960
time and time again, to give birth
to my daughter...

35:33.360 --> 35:35.360
I could see it in her eyes.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.880
She had it too.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.560
Get this fucking done.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.760
Janet, where are you?

36:23.800 --> 36:24.000
Janet?

36:24.000 --> 36:27.440
Janet?

36:33.800 --> 36:36.600
How could you?
How could you do that?

36:36.640 --> 36:38.760
How could you fucking do that?

36:38.800 --> 36:40.000
In the end, neither of us
could take it any more.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.720
In the end, neither of us
could take it any more.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.400
There you go.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.880
It all became...

36:46.880 --> 36:48.000
Janet, can you hear me, love?
..one experience... Big push now.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.200
Janet, can you hear me, love?
..one experience... Big push now.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.000
Pain and blood and screaming...

36:55.760 --> 36:56.000
..and my daughter,
ripped from inside me,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.920
..and my daughter,
ripped from inside me,

36:58.960 --> 37:01.000
again and again and again,

37:01.040 --> 37:04.000
and, for the longest time,

37:04.000 --> 37:04.040
and, for the longest time,

37:04.080 --> 37:06.760
I truly believed
it would never end.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.360
We have to go again.
We have to try again!

37:15.400 --> 37:18.080
The opposition just took the
Parliament building

37:18.120 --> 37:20.000
and the TV station.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.040
and the TV station.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.840
Our intelligence shows it worked.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.760
No. No, Wes, please, no.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.280
Wes, please, no.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.280
It's not giving us anything new.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.280
OK.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.000
Dennis?
Hey. You're all right, Faye.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.760
Dennis?
Hey. You're all right, Faye.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.240
Sit.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.000
I need to see it.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.480
I need to see it.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.000
I need to see the machine.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.320
There is no machine.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.480
There's gotta be something.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.000
Who are you callin'?
Who's on the other end of the line?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.280
Who are you callin'?
Who's on the other end of the line?

38:11.320 --> 38:13.600
You know I can't share
that information with you.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.000
What is it?
A shadowy cabal of billionaires?

38:16.000 --> 38:16.760
What is it?
A shadowy cabal of billionaires?

38:16.800 --> 38:20.160
Secret society? Alien spaceship?

38:22.440 --> 38:24.000
I need to know who
the fuck I'm working for.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
I need to know who
the fuck I'm working for.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.760
You work for me.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.560
I'm as high up the chain as you go.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.000
Dennis...

38:32.000 --> 38:32.200
Dennis...

38:32.240 --> 38:35.480
I am so sorry for everything that's
happened to you. Shut up, Wes.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.000
And-- Just shut up.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.000
You need to go home to your family,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.160
You need to go home to your family,

38:42.200 --> 38:44.680
and you need to rest.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.880
The world wants to die.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.000
It wants to die
and we keep stoppin' it.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.360
It wants to die
and we keep stoppin' it.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.400
Please...

39:03.160 --> 39:04.000
please put the gun down.

39:04.000 --> 39:04.560
please put the gun down.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.720
We're not in control here!

39:06.760 --> 39:10.200
We don't get to decide when we live
and when we die!

39:13.240 --> 39:16.000
I'm gonna stop you playing God.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.960
I'm gonna destroy
that fucking machine

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
and I'm gonna let the world do what
it so desperately wants to do.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.400
and I'm gonna let the world do what
it so desperately wants to do.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.840
We've saved millions of lives.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.200
Lives that weren't meant
to be saved!

39:26.240 --> 39:28.000
We're not supposed to be here!

39:28.000 --> 39:28.800
We're not supposed to be here!

39:28.840 --> 39:30.200
We're a pox!

39:31.600 --> 39:33.680
What are you willin' to lose, Wes?

39:33.720 --> 39:36.000
What are you willin' to sacrifice?

39:36.000 --> 39:36.440
What are you willin' to sacrifice?

39:39.400 --> 39:42.080
Just take me to it, for God's sake.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.000
No.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.160
No.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.000
She had more time than my son.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.000
Take me to it.

40:00.000 --> 40:00.520
Take me to it.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.760
Put it down.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.080
Dennis?

40:52.120 --> 40:53.800
Dennis, are you there? Dennis?

40:53.840 --> 40:56.000
Janet, I'm sorry.

40:56.000 --> 40:56.920
Janet, I'm sorry.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.400
You need to run.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.520
What did you do?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.000
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.080
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.720
I'm gonna destroy them.
I'm gonna destroy them all.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.800
Dennis...
I love you.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.840
Dennis, listen--

41:24.760 --> 41:27.360
I'm so sorry--
Don't.

41:29.160 --> 41:31.080
What's done is done.
