A family in LA are living in

I mean, they're hoping that by having
no impact, they'll have an impact.

00:13.665 --> 00:14.220
Ow.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.515
Walter wanted me to convey
his most sincere apologies

00:17.551 --> 00:19.968
for bumping you off the show again.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.471
- How do you know Walter?
- He's my sex and love addict sponsor.

00:23.473 --> 00:26.107
- Rosalie, this is Rosalie.
- What?

00:26.143 --> 00:28.810
Here's my weird thing. I
get too drunk at parties.

00:28.812 --> 00:31.563

- This is all my fault.
- Oh, don't beat yourself up.

Not everything is your fault.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.499
Yes, I'm fine, Harry.

01:24.534 --> 01:28.253
I don't feel so muddled
when I look at the sky.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.754
Very good, sir.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.207
Is that Ronnie's petting goat?

01:32.259 --> 01:35.627
Yes, sir. He forgot her.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.762
She's a sweet lass.

01:37.798 --> 01:41.099
Yes, I looked into her eyes last night.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.467
Very soulful.

01:42.519 --> 01:46.104
She would have made a
great silent film star.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.112
I would agree, sir.

01:55.732 --> 01:58.066
That was quite the party, sir.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.118
The boys would be proud.

02:00.153 --> 02:01.619
Yes.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.321
What's the word on Dr. Weiss?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.657
He's in a stable condition, sir.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.125
Should be out in a week.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.044
Oh, excellent.

02:09.079 --> 02:13.131
I saw you sneak into the tent with Sylvia.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.468
Yes, Major.

02:16.503 --> 02:19.971
I may have had a
breakthrough with my issue.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.890
Only took 50-odd years.

02:21.925 --> 02:25.643
Harry, I'm so pleased to hear this.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.980
I didn't see the red comet
followed by the black void

02:29.016 --> 02:30.348
as you described it, sir,

02:30.400 --> 02:32.684
but I did tell Sylvia I loved her.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.569
I-I couldn't help myself.

02:34.604 --> 02:36.571
Well, that's all right. It's natural.

02:36.606 --> 02:38.823
[mutters] It happens.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.076
Could I have some more coffee, please?

02:42.779 --> 02:46.948
Well, I didn't sneak off
with anyone last night.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.368
But I did smoke some marijuana.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.537
Yes, sir.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.291
I had a somewhat alarming dream.

02:56.293 --> 02:59.010
Or flashback.

02:59.046 --> 03:03.465
The day that Westhoff and Kent, you know.

03:03.467 --> 03:04.849
Yes, sir.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.852
[softly] I hesitated, Harry.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.806
And then there was too much fire.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.859
I... I couldn't get to them.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.363
I've never told you exactly
what happened before.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.899
You haven't needed to, sir.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.985
I've always known you blame yourself.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.121
Unfairly.

03:26.156 --> 03:28.206
I shouldn't be here, Harry.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.575
I should have gone with them.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.661
Then who would have saved me?

03:37.250 --> 03:39.501
I don't know if it's of interest, sir,

03:39.553 --> 03:41.836
but I saw an article last month

03:41.838 --> 03:44.005
about a psychologist here in LA

03:44.057 --> 03:47.642
who works with vets who have
post-traumatic stress disorder.

03:47.677 --> 03:49.594
You think I have PTSD?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.596
Perhaps we both have a touch of it, sir.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.481
I don't have PTSD, Harry.

03:53.517 --> 03:55.316
How could I have
functioned all these years?

03:55.352 --> 03:58.653
You function, but it doesn't
mean you don't suffer.

03:58.688 --> 04:01.322
We could try to see him today.

04:01.358 --> 04:03.491
He has a unique approach.

04:03.527 --> 04:06.744
Hi. Great party, Walter. [giggles]

04:06.780 --> 04:09.531
- Do you have any coffee?
- Hershel, is that my robe?

04:09.583 --> 04:12.083
Not to worry. No sex happened in this robe.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.752
[laughs] Okay, bye.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.172
That one is a firecracker.
We'll discuss it at group.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.676
- Here we go.
- Oh, thank you.

04:24.214 --> 04:25.880
No, no, Martin.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.550
You have to look us in
the eye when you drink.

04:28.552 --> 04:31.719
Otherwise it means years of bad sex.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.389
Yeah, I didn't look someone
in the eyes back in '79.

04:34.391 --> 04:36.808
I was cursed with premature ejaculation

04:36.860 --> 04:38.776
till I met Rosalie in '85.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.695
Oh, sorry.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.370
Oh, I got you some things for
your trip to the Appalachian Trail.

04:49.406 --> 04:51.456
I'll be right back.

[both sigh]

04:53.543 --> 04:55.543
Teddy seems really good.

04:55.579 --> 04:58.580
He's taking huge doses of vitamin E.

04:58.582 --> 05:00.915
- Oh.
- Maybe it'll help.

05:03.420 --> 05:07.639
So did you have a nice time

05:07.674 --> 05:10.341
with the other Rosalie last night?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.393
Eh, it was okay.

05:12.429 --> 05:14.729
But she's not as fun as you.

05:14.764 --> 05:17.182
[laughs] Course she's not.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.067
Oh.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.987
I'm gonna miss you, Martin.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.572
[softly] Yeah.

05:24.608 --> 05:27.275
Are you sure you have to go find yourself

05:27.327 --> 05:28.826
on the Appalachian Trail?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.778
I'm only walking a part of the trail,

05:30.830 --> 05:33.281
so I might not find my whole self.

05:33.283 --> 05:35.583
Stand up, son.

05:35.619 --> 05:37.835
A journey requires a proper benediction.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.872
Mark Strand, one of the
greats. Let me read a few lines.

05:40.924 --> 05:44.209
"In a field, I am the absence of field.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.128
This is always the case wherever I am.

05:47.130 --> 05:50.298
I am what is missing."

05:50.350 --> 05:52.634
Everything a man needs
for a proper walkabout.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.137
A stick, a book of poetry, a compass,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.972
and a kiss.

05:57.974 --> 06:00.308
Mm.

06:00.310 --> 06:03.861
Oh, my two men.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.731
<i>♪</i> Here we go, guys. Here we go.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.567

06:09.619 --> 06:11.653
Really feel that music, you guys.

06:11.655 --> 06:14.656
I work on the principle
that the body and the mind

06:14.658 --> 06:16.958
are deeply connected.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.628
They're like you two.

06:20.664 --> 06:22.830
The thing that's important
for you to understand is

06:22.832 --> 06:26.501
that you can approach your
issues through the body.

06:26.503 --> 06:29.254
But, Doctor, can I have had PTSD

06:29.306 --> 06:31.256
for over 30 years and not know it?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.508
Well, it's impossible to
tell by just looking at you.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.893
But let me ask you a question.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.597
How do you feel inside your body right now?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.683
- What do you mean?
- Your blink response.

06:41.685 --> 06:44.852
How does your body feel here at its center?

06:44.854 --> 06:46.604
- On guard.
- Why?

06:46.656 --> 06:48.573
- Self-defense.
- Are you afraid?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.528
- Yes.
- Are you afraid of me?

06:53.530 --> 06:54.996
No, I don't think so.

06:55.031 --> 06:58.583
Well, then fear might
be your resting position.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.535
Like a car set at the wrong idle.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.254
How about you, Harry? How do you feel

07:03.290 --> 07:05.923
<i>inside your body right now?</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:08.376
[softly] I don't feel anything.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.379
Excellent. Excellent responses both of you.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.598
Now tell me, what sort
of music do you like?

07:13.633 --> 07:15.433
- Buddy Holly.
- Taylor Swift.

07:15.468 --> 07:19.020
- Randy Newman.
- Anything with a flute.

07:19.055 --> 07:20.688
[rings] Hey, Mom.

07:20.724 --> 07:23.558
What's wrong? Your face looks funny.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.228
Nothing. I... I think I'm happy.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.731
Well, that's wonderful. What happened?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.533
Well, don't tell Dad, because
he'll ask too many questions,

07:32.569 --> 07:35.737
but there's... there's this girl at...

07:35.739 --> 07:38.122
You're in love? Is it mutual?

07:38.158 --> 07:39.457
Can she have children?

07:39.492 --> 07:43.211
Uh, it's probably not mutual,

07:43.246 --> 07:47.382
but it's just nice to
feel something, you know?

07:48.585 --> 07:50.218
How's Walter?

07:50.253 --> 07:51.586
He still seeing that Freudian?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.756
Yes, but Dr. Weiss had a heart attack

07:54.808 --> 07:56.307
last night from cocaine.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.059
Figures.

07:58.094 --> 08:00.428
Yeah, it is terrible.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.598
We must express our feelings.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.185
Otherwise the body
breaks, so does the mind.

08:07.237 --> 08:11.022
Shakespeare said, "My tongue
will tell the anger of my heart,

08:11.074 --> 08:13.908
or else my heart,
concealing it, will break."

08:13.943 --> 08:16.160
- <i>Taming of the Shrew.</i>
- Yes, exactly.

08:16.196 --> 08:19.280
So as you can see, I'm not
really saying anything very new.

08:19.282 --> 08:21.499
And you think that dance can help this?

08:21.534 --> 08:23.584
Yes. Now, this is not a cure.

08:23.620 --> 08:26.788
It's just a part of our
overall holistic approach.

08:26.790 --> 08:29.457
Martha, Linda.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.426
What I'd like to do now is just give you

08:31.461 --> 08:34.095
a sort of a brief introduction to the work.

08:34.130 --> 08:36.631
I don't know, ladies.
This seems somewhat absurd.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.765
I won't step on your toes, I promise.

08:38.802 --> 08:42.102
You liked dancing during your

- Morning, everyone.
- ALL: Morning.

09:19.142 --> 09:23.511
We have a lot to do, so let's
get started with Dr. Mendelson,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.063
the post-traumatic
stress disorder specialist

09:26.099 --> 09:28.766
whom Harry and I saw this weekend.

09:28.818 --> 09:32.353
He thinks that I may have...

09:33.106 --> 09:35.773
PTSD.

09:35.825 --> 09:39.360
And that my body has been set on frightened

09:39.412 --> 09:41.028
for the past 33 years.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.664
Are you sure? This is terrible.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.283
No, what is terrible
is not dealing with it.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.286
I have spent the last 24 hours researching

09:48.338 --> 09:52.256
the most current treatments,
including psychomotor

09:52.292 --> 09:54.542
and dance therapy.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.679
I want to do a series on this.

09:58.715 --> 10:03.267
As I educate myself, we
can educate our audience.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.137
If I talk about having PTSD,

10:06.189 --> 10:10.191
there are so many people,
especially veterans,

10:10.226 --> 10:11.559
whom we can help.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.195
A six-part series? I
always like six-part series.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.647
Sure, and I booked Dr.
Mendelson for tonight.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.150
Oh, but we have a packed show, Walter.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.869
Yeah, and the interview segment
is the zero-impact family.

10:21.905 --> 10:25.289
Oh, shit. Oh, I really want
to get this series started.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.909
But then their message
is terribly crucial, too.

10:27.911 --> 10:31.579
We could shift the zero-impact
family to tomorrow night.

10:31.581 --> 10:33.915
That could work. Tonight
we focus on helping

10:33.967 --> 10:36.584
people with PTSD, tomorrow the environment.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.503
How many times have we bumped the Adlers?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.421
This will be the third.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.923
Well, that's not very much.

10:41.925 --> 10:44.225
We will put them up in
an eco-friendly hotel.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.811
- Celia, bump the Adlers.
- But I bumped them last time.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.429
And I bumped them the time before that.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.565
- Jim, bump the Adlers.
- What?

10:50.600 --> 10:52.183
I... you know I'm not good at bumping.

10:52.235 --> 10:56.103
Jim, if you can broadcast, you can bump.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.990
[mumbling] Try and relax, Duncan.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.609
Chew your lettuce wrap and breathe.

11:01.611 --> 11:03.778
I am chewing and
breathing. Don't pick on me.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.580
We're about to be on national television.

11:05.615 --> 11:06.864
This is what we've been waiting for.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.916
You're starving your brain of oxygen.

11:08.952 --> 11:10.952
- And that's why you feel panicked.
- I don't feel panicked!

11:10.954 --> 11:12.753
<i>[knock on door]</i>
Yes!? Come in. Come in.

11:12.789 --> 11:15.673
Hey, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Adler.

11:15.708 --> 11:19.010
Um, my name's Jim and I would like...

11:19.045 --> 11:20.545
You're here for the
pre-interview, of course.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.014
Um, here, we prepared a list

11:23.049 --> 11:24.632
of questions this time for Mr. Blunt.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.766
We thought it might be helpful.

11:25.802 --> 11:29.220
Oh, ahem, sweet. Cool.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.439
Uh, questions.

11:31.474 --> 11:33.774
Um...

11:33.810 --> 11:35.026
<i>[Jim clears throat]</i>

11:38.565 --> 11:40.114
uh... [chuckles]

11:40.149 --> 11:42.783
Oh, no. You're here to bump us.

11:42.819 --> 11:45.736
- No, it can't be.
- Gaia damn it.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.290
Did you say gay damn it?

11:49.325 --> 11:50.992
I said Gaia damn it.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.628
It's the Greek mother of nature.
It's an Earth-friendly curse.

11:53.663 --> 11:55.246
- Oh.
- But look what you made me do.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.882
I littered. There's chickpeas
everywhere going to waste.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.334
- [back cracks] Ow! Ow.
- Oh, Dunky.

12:00.336 --> 12:02.303
- Oh, what's happening?
- Oh.

12:02.338 --> 12:03.838
I'm having a crippling back spasm.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.339
What do you think is happening?

12:05.341 --> 12:08.259
- Oh, Gaia. I'm sorry.
- Ow.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.511
Um, Walter promises

12:10.563 --> 12:13.147
that he'll have you on
tomorrow night. I swear.

12:13.182 --> 12:15.900
Can you say with 100% certainty

12:15.935 --> 12:18.269
that we're gonna be on
<i>Blunt Talk</i> tomorrow?

12:18.321 --> 12:20.655
Well, I mean...

12:20.690 --> 12:22.857
I can't believe this.
Please get out of here.

12:22.859 --> 12:25.276
Okay, but Walter wants to put
you up in a eco-friendly hotel.

12:25.328 --> 12:28.529
Out! You are the worst bumper yet.

12:28.531 --> 12:31.282
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.703
I knew they were gonna bump us.

12:35.705 --> 12:37.371
I'm taking this to the next level.

12:37.373 --> 12:38.873
I don't have a lot of
time to make it happen.

12:38.875 --> 12:42.093
Duncan! You left your cell phone charged?

12:42.128 --> 12:46.047
Yeah, sometimes we got to make
compromises for the greater good.

12:46.049 --> 12:47.715
What, you don't love me anymore?

12:47.717 --> 12:49.717
No, I will always love you, Duncan.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.637
All right, now before I make these calls,

12:52.689 --> 12:54.722
I want you to walk on my back.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.223
But give me something to bite on

12:56.275 --> 12:58.392
so I don't sever my tongue like last time.

12:59.395 --> 13:00.895
[whispers] Here you go.

13:02.899 --> 13:04.815
[cracks] [screaming]

13:10.206 --> 13:12.239
[screaming continues]

13:12.291 --> 13:14.375
There.

13:14.410 --> 13:16.794
That's a good Dunky.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.590
Where's Walter, Harry?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.475
He's in the edit with Shelly

13:31.511 --> 13:34.512
going over clips for the PTSD segment.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.148
He's really invested in this.

13:37.183 --> 13:38.766
Yes.

13:38.768 --> 13:41.769
Well, I think he's trying
to make up for the war.

13:41.771 --> 13:43.604
Poor Major. He's been carrying

13:43.606 --> 13:46.107
a lot of guilt for a long time.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.609
What about you, Rosalie. Are you all right?

13:48.611 --> 13:50.411
Seem a little blue.

13:50.446 --> 13:52.163
[sighs] I am.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.782
I can't stop worrying about Teddy.

13:54.784 --> 13:57.785
- Oh.
- I was hoping Walter and I might spoon.

13:57.787 --> 13:59.503
Do you want me to fetch him?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.872
No, he's busy.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.343
Would you like to spoon, Harry?

14:08.548 --> 14:10.131
I'd be honored.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.272
Jim?

14:18.307 --> 14:19.774
Hey. Hey.

14:19.809 --> 14:21.525
How did it go with the Adlers?

14:21.561 --> 14:24.111
Not well. He became hysterical.

14:24.147 --> 14:25.896
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.482
I hate bumping. I'm the worst at it.

14:28.484 --> 14:31.035
Yeah, me, too. But don't be down.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.120
Let's think of something positive.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.990
Um...

14:37.960 --> 14:40.461
Oh, no, I... I can't come up with anything.

14:40.496 --> 14:43.881
Yeah, me neither. I feel
like I'm a rescue dog.

14:43.916 --> 14:47.168
I'm, just, like, permanently
scared of other people.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.921
[sighs]

14:53.843 --> 14:56.343
Um, I think I just...

14:56.395 --> 14:59.847
I think I just thought
of something positive.

14:59.849 --> 15:02.850
It's... it's kind of embarrassing.

15:02.852 --> 15:05.352
[chuckles] Should I tell you?

15:05.354 --> 15:06.320
Well, you have to now.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.942
Even though you got drunk
at the party and passed out,

15:11.994 --> 15:14.028
I really liked being there with you.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.248
I really like spending time with you.

15:17.283 --> 15:20.534
You know, socially.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.369
Or not.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.255
I feel the same.

15:26.876 --> 15:28.959
I'm gonna put the pillow back on.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.348
[sighs]

15:36.552 --> 15:38.636
This is nice.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.972
I thought your passion was knitting, Harry.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.476
When did you start reading romance novels?

15:45.528 --> 15:47.945
This weekend.

15:47.980 --> 15:52.066
See, my trauma had me
numb for the longest time.

15:52.068 --> 15:53.067
Mm-hmm.

15:53.069 --> 15:55.369
But then at the party, well,

15:55.404 --> 15:58.873
I had something of a sexual awakening.

15:58.908 --> 16:02.543
I can tell, Harry. It's very nice.

16:02.578 --> 16:04.411
Oh, dear.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.580
I'm so sorry.

16:06.582 --> 16:10.584
I... I don't have a lot of
experience with spooning.

16:10.586 --> 16:13.003
Oh, I don't mind.

16:14.590 --> 16:16.674
Oh, okay.

16:19.929 --> 16:21.762
What are you two doing?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.430
You're in the wrong positions.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.232
I'm trying something new.

16:25.268 --> 16:27.268
Well, get up at once. Both of you.

16:27.270 --> 16:29.270
We have a very important
broadcast to work on.

- Sit down!
- No.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.919
Okay, fine, I'll stand.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.638
This is the interview
we were supposed to have.

17:37.673 --> 17:38.923
Ask me the questions.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.176
I will not do anything that you ask.

17:42.178 --> 17:44.228
I was sympathetic to your cause,

17:44.263 --> 17:46.897
but I am not sympathetic to violence.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

17:48.434 --> 17:49.817
If I'm crazy enough to do this,

17:49.852 --> 17:51.435
I am crazy enough to shoot you.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.520
Walter, listen to him.

17:53.522 --> 17:55.739
What is that? What's that?

17:57.026 --> 18:00.444
All right. That's what I'll do.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.829
[sighs]

18:01.864 --> 18:03.948
Is there any hope for the environment?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.334
Whew, coming out swinging.

18:07.370 --> 18:09.336
Excellent question.

18:09.372 --> 18:12.539
Yes, there is hope for the
environment. [monitor beeping]

18:12.541 --> 18:14.875
<i>You know, I grew up</i>
<i>in LA and they said</i>

18:14.877 --> 18:16.877
there was nothing that
could be done about the smog.

18:16.929 --> 18:21.548
But in the last 40 years, the
smog has been reduced by 98%

18:21.550 --> 18:24.969
and there are four times as many cars on
the road and four times as many people.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.138
So, yes, I'd say we're capable of change.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.107
OFFICER: Drop the gun!
Whoa, whoa, back off, cops.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.726
- Back off. Back off. Back off. Back up.
- No, no, officers.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.446
Officers, d-don't take any chances, please.

18:35.481 --> 18:36.897
- Yeah.
- Back off. Let...

18:36.899 --> 18:38.899
just let this madman have his say.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.534
That's right, I'm a madman.

18:40.569 --> 18:43.487
Mr. Adler, point the gun at me. At me.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.122
Okay? There, that's good.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.491
Yeah, all right. Here we go. Next question.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.575
[sighs]

18:48.627 --> 18:50.911
What is the bad news?

18:50.913 --> 18:54.081
These are overly simple
questions, don't you think?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.916
No editorializing.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.718
Here's the bad news.

18:57.753 --> 19:00.387
If we had listened to
the NASA report in '87,

19:00.423 --> 19:02.589
we could have saved
places like South Florida,

19:02.641 --> 19:04.925
downtown Manhattan, and Bangladesh.

19:04.927 --> 19:08.929
But it's too late. So
let's save Central Florida.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.597
Let's save Midtown.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.067
Let's save, you know, the areas

19:13.102 --> 19:15.436
slightly above Bangladesh.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.571
Next question.

19:17.606 --> 19:20.524
You know, Mr. Adler, we could have sat down

19:20.576 --> 19:22.443
and talked about this reasonably.

19:22.445 --> 19:24.611
But you kept bumping me.

<i>Now read the next question.</i>

I'm sure it's one you'll like.

Is saving the environment
bad for the economy?

No! [laughs]

- I have a bad back.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.305
It could be repressed anger, you know?

- Stay back, everyone.

21:12.054 --> 21:14.104
Listen, maybe I drove you to this

21:14.140 --> 21:17.558
with bumping you all the
time, but this is not the way.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.643
I was about to start a six-part series.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.311
Six-part series? Really? Wow, that's a lot.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.064
Yeah, well, I could have had
you on tomorrow night as well.

21:24.066 --> 21:26.316
If only... no, don't
point that at your head.

Good evening. This is <i> Blunt Talk.</i>

22:28.330 --> 22:30.764
- I'm James Stone.
- And I'm Celia Havemeyer.

22:30.799 --> 22:32.633
We're filling in for Walter Blunt

22:32.635 --> 22:35.469
who was abducted 24 hours
ago during our broadcast.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.438
Duncan Adler, a radical eco-terrorist,

22:38.474 --> 22:40.641
formed a flash mob outside of UBS

22:40.693 --> 22:43.393
to fashion his escape while
holding Blunt prisoner.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.813
Waiting for the mob were
100 Chevy Volts and Priuses.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.700
The members of the mob, disguised
to look like Adler and Blunt,

22:49.735 --> 22:51.902
<i>drove off in the cars</i>
<i>in numerous directions</i>

22:51.954 --> 22:54.454

22:56.959 --> 22:59.293
