01:18.276 --> 01:21.586
I started out working in mortgage
bonds, but I found that so limiting.

01:21.756 --> 01:24.509
My friend Kramer and I were
discussing that the other day.

01:24.676 --> 01:26.428
He was with Brandt-Leland
for a while.

01:28.516 --> 01:31.588
Well, then my mentor suggested
that I move into equities.

01:31.756 --> 01:33.314
Best move I ever made.

01:33.476 --> 01:35.307
- Mentor? You mean your boss?
- No, no, no.

01:35.476 --> 01:37.228
Cynthia's a successful
businesswoman...

01:37.396 --> 01:39.432
...who's taken me under her wing.

01:39.596 --> 01:42.554
- So Cynthia's your mentor?
- And I'm her protégé.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.515
You must have someone like that.

01:44.676 --> 01:46.746
You know, who guides you
in your career path.

01:46.916 --> 01:49.510
Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.309
I still don't understand this.
Abby has a mentor?

01:57.476 --> 02:00.309
Yes. And the mentor
advises the protégé.

02:00.476 --> 02:02.387
Is there any money involved?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.945
- No.
- So, what's in it for the mentor?

02:05.116 --> 02:07.346
Respect, admiration, prestige.

02:10.795 --> 02:13.390
Would the protégé
pick up stuff for the mentor?

02:13.556 --> 02:17.629
I suppose if it was on the protégé's
way to the mentor, they might.

02:18.036 --> 02:19.469
Laundry? Dry cleaning?

02:20.116 --> 02:22.152
It's not a valet, it's a protégé.

02:22.796 --> 02:23.945
All right.

02:24.396 --> 02:28.628
Listen, I gotta get some reading done.
You mind if I do this here?

02:28.796 --> 02:31.435
I can't concentrate in my apartment.

02:31.996 --> 02:33.668
- "Risk management"?
- Yeah.

02:33.876 --> 02:35.992
Steinbrenner wants everyone
in the front office...

02:36.156 --> 02:38.670
...to give a lecture
in their area of business expertise.

02:38.836 --> 02:40.906
What makes them think
you're a risk-management expert?

02:41.316 --> 02:43.625
I guess it's on my résumé.

02:47.316 --> 02:50.513
- Hello?
- Please hold for Elaine Benes.

02:51.516 --> 02:56.226
You know what? I can't do this.
I can't read books anymore.

02:56.396 --> 02:58.148
Books on tape
have ruined me, Jerry.

02:58.316 --> 03:02.229
I need that nice voice. This book
has my voice. I hate my voice.

03:02.396 --> 03:05.911
- So get this book on tape.
- You can't. It's a textbook.

03:06.076 --> 03:08.795
Hey, Jer, are you going
to this Bob Sacamano party?

03:08.956 --> 03:10.753
Am I going? It was three nights ago.

03:10.916 --> 03:14.147
What? You're kidding.
I just got this invitation today.

03:14.316 --> 03:18.229
Oh, I was so excited.
It's really a beautiful invitation.

03:18.396 --> 03:20.546
Oh, it was a lovely affair.

03:21.236 --> 03:22.635
Oh, wait a minute.

03:22.796 --> 03:28.348
This postmark is three weeks old.
Man, this happens all the time.

03:28.516 --> 03:30.905
Janine, who the hell
runs the mailroom?

03:31.076 --> 03:33.271
- Eddie Sherman.
- All right. Send him up here.

03:33.436 --> 03:36.348
- You gonna do a little yelling?
- I'm gonna do a little firing.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.826
That is so cool.
Can you put me on the speaker?

03:39.996 --> 03:42.510
Oh, yeah. Sure.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.230
Give me a break.

03:52.516 --> 03:54.074
Hey, Copernicus.

03:57.156 --> 04:00.626
- Eddie Sherman is here.
- Oh, great. Send him in.

04:06.636 --> 04:10.549
- You wanted to see me?
- Eddie, yes.

04:10.716 --> 04:14.311
I am so sorry, but I'm afraid
we're gonna have to...

04:16.236 --> 04:18.192
...promote you.

04:20.116 --> 04:21.390
So, what did you say?

04:21.555 --> 04:23.911
Well, I called him
all the way up to my office...

04:24.076 --> 04:26.067
...so I had to tell him
something important.

04:26.996 --> 04:29.749
So I promoted him.

04:31.116 --> 04:33.630
- What? What did you...?
- Copywriter.

04:34.556 --> 04:36.228
He's writing copy?

04:36.636 --> 04:41.266
Well, it can't be any worse than the
pointless drivel we normally churn out.

04:44.156 --> 04:45.828
Check it out.

04:45.996 --> 04:49.671
- "Jewish singles night"?
- I expect you both to be there.

04:49.876 --> 04:52.231
- I'm not Jewish.
- Well, neither am I.

04:52.396 --> 04:56.275
- Well, why are you going?
- I'm not. I'm running it.

04:56.876 --> 04:59.310
- What are you talking about?
- Lomez usually runs it...

04:59.476 --> 05:00.875
...but he's in the Everglades.

05:02.116 --> 05:04.391
- Lomez is Jewish?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:04.556 --> 05:07.628
Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.

05:09.196 --> 05:12.154
At the Knights of Columbus?

05:12.636 --> 05:15.150
Yeah. Frank Costanza's
getting me a room in his lodge.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.955
Jerry, I'm really counting on you
to come to this.

05:18.116 --> 05:19.390
- Kramer...
- Jerry, look.

05:19.556 --> 05:21.387
I'm cooking all the food myself.

05:21.556 --> 05:26.107
"A tempting schmeer
of authentic Jewish delicacies."

05:27.596 --> 05:29.473
Do you like tsimmes?

05:31.756 --> 05:34.224
My mentor says
the duck is outstanding here.

05:34.636 --> 05:37.469
I'm not really a duck fan.
The skin seems sort of human.

05:38.916 --> 05:41.305
Oh, look who's here. Cynthia.

05:41.476 --> 05:43.068
- Hello, Abby.
- Hello.

05:43.236 --> 05:45.147
Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman,
my mentor.

05:45.316 --> 05:48.035
- Hello.
- Hi, Jerry. Nice to finally meet you.

05:48.196 --> 05:49.788
Join us. We can pull up a chair.

05:49.956 --> 05:52.390
Well, great.
My boyfriend's just parking the car.

05:52.756 --> 05:56.146
Actually, Jerry, you might know him.
He's a comic too.

05:56.316 --> 05:58.830
- No kidding.
- Kenny Bania.

05:58.996 --> 06:00.224
Bania?

06:01.236 --> 06:04.069
Hey, Jerry. How's it going?

06:04.236 --> 06:06.796
You gonna join us for dinner?
The duck here is the best.

06:06.956 --> 06:08.105
The best, Jerry.

06:12.436 --> 06:15.109
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you.

06:15.276 --> 06:17.665
I noticed that you have
a textbook on tape.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.155
May I ask where you got that?

06:19.316 --> 06:22.069
Reading for the Blind.
They can get any book on tape.

06:22.236 --> 06:24.796
I tell you, I am hooked
on these books on tape.

06:24.956 --> 06:28.505
Tell me about it. These things
have ruined me for Braille.

06:31.436 --> 06:32.630
Reading for the Blind?

06:32.956 --> 06:35.550
I take an eye test, I flunk it.
Next thing you know...

06:35.716 --> 06:39.425
...I am swinging to the sweet sounds
of risk management.

06:40.676 --> 06:44.271
- So I finally met the mentor.
- What's she like? lmpressive?

06:44.436 --> 06:47.633
Oh, yeah. She's dating Bania.

06:48.916 --> 06:50.395
- Bania?
- Yeah.

06:50.556 --> 06:54.344
I had to spend two hours at dinner
last night with that specimen.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.309
- What'd you have?
- Chicken.

06:56.476 --> 06:58.034
How could she look up
to a person...

06:58.196 --> 07:00.426
...who voluntarily
spends time with Bania?

07:00.596 --> 07:01.790
- Marsala?
- Piccata.

07:01.956 --> 07:04.675
If anything,
I should be dating a mentor...

07:04.836 --> 07:08.033
...and Bania should be
setting pins at a bowling alley.

07:08.716 --> 07:11.833
- All right. I got a test to fail.
- Hey, good luck with that.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.146
Thanks. Dad.

07:14.316 --> 07:16.307
What are you,
in an athletic sweat suit?

07:16.476 --> 07:17.670
What are you doing here?

07:17.836 --> 07:19.827
Came to get his check
for the banquet hall.

07:19.996 --> 07:25.707
You know, I got 183 responses.
Oh, it's gonna be a rager.

07:26.236 --> 07:29.592
Kramer, how are you gonna cook
Jewish delicacies for 183 people?

07:29.916 --> 07:33.147
You're right. That's a lot of pupiks.

07:33.756 --> 07:35.872
Frank, you know anybody
who can help me cook?

07:36.036 --> 07:37.674
Cook? No. I don't know any cooks.

07:37.836 --> 07:40.111
I don't know anything
about cooking!

07:41.636 --> 07:42.910
What's the matter with him?

07:43.276 --> 07:46.825
My dad was a cook
during the Korean War.

07:46.996 --> 07:49.351
Something very bad happened.

07:49.516 --> 07:51.666
Ever since,
you can't get him near a kitchen.

07:51.836 --> 07:53.906
- Shell-shocked?
- Oh, yeah.

07:54.076 --> 07:56.351
But that has nothing to do with it.

07:58.116 --> 08:00.391
Good work, guys.
That ought to do it for today.

08:00.556 --> 08:01.750
- Alrighty?
- Wait.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.555
You didn't ask me about my ideas.

08:04.876 --> 08:07.106
Oh, Eddie, well, it's your first day.

08:07.276 --> 08:10.154
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

08:12.396 --> 08:16.389
"It's a hot night. The mind races.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.389
You think about your knife...

08:21.476 --> 08:24.866
...the only friend
who hasn't betrayed you.

08:26.036 --> 08:29.585
The only friend
who won't be dead by sun-up.

08:32.076 --> 08:37.673
Sleep tight, mates,
in your quilted chambray nightshirts."

08:43.556 --> 08:46.116
What am I gonna do?
He is a disaster.

08:46.276 --> 08:50.906
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe
he's in line for another promotion.

08:51.676 --> 08:54.474
You know what?
You are exactly right.

08:54.636 --> 08:56.945
That is what I should do.
I should promote him.

08:57.356 --> 09:00.871
I'll give him another office
on another floor, and he can sit there...

09:01.036 --> 09:04.346
...with his nice title
and his bayonet...

09:04.516 --> 09:06.905
...and stop freaking me out.

09:10.156 --> 09:11.987
Nothing at all.

09:13.836 --> 09:16.396
Well, George,
your vision is quite impaired.

09:17.916 --> 09:20.953
If you'll just sign this
insurance form. Here's a pen.

09:30.276 --> 09:32.232
You're a very handsome man,
by the way.

09:38.436 --> 09:41.189
What the hell is going on here?

09:43.956 --> 09:45.674
Look out!

09:49.916 --> 09:53.431
- What are you doing?
- I got three kitchens going.

09:53.836 --> 09:58.193
I got brisket going at Newman's,
I got kugel working at Mrs. Zanfino's...

09:58.356 --> 09:59.675
...and this is kreplach.

09:59.836 --> 10:02.714
Here, try some of this.

10:02.876 --> 10:06.949
- No, I don't want to.
- Eat, eat, you're skin and bones.

10:10.556 --> 10:13.514
- Oh, this is awful.
- Oh, Jerry, it's kreplach.

10:13.676 --> 10:16.065
It's an acquired taste. Yeah.

10:23.836 --> 10:25.189
Did you follow the recipe?

10:25.356 --> 10:26.994
The recipe was for four to six.

10:27.156 --> 10:30.068
I had to multiply it for 183 people.

10:30.236 --> 10:32.386
I guess I got confused.

10:33.596 --> 10:34.870
It tastes like dirt.

10:35.036 --> 10:37.755
Well, I also dropped it
on the way over.

10:37.916 --> 10:39.907
Jerry, I'm in trouble.
I got no skills.

10:40.076 --> 10:44.513
I can't peel, I can't chop,
I can't grate, I can't mince.

10:44.676 --> 10:46.871
I got no sense of flavour, obviously.

10:48.596 --> 10:49.711
I gotta talk to Frank.

10:49.876 --> 10:51.628
- You can't...
- I gotta talk to him.

10:51.796 --> 10:53.070
I know that he can help me...

10:53.236 --> 10:55.796
I think there's a dead animal
in the elevator.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.231
My stuffed cabbage.

11:01.636 --> 11:04.389
- So great dinner last night.
- Yeah, it was all right.

11:04.556 --> 11:06.945
I told Cynthia we'd double
with her and Bania Saturday...

11:07.116 --> 11:09.311
...and then catch his act.
- No. No.

11:09.476 --> 11:12.468
- No way. No Bania.
- What?

11:12.636 --> 11:15.946
Have you seen his act? He's got
a 12-minute bit about Ovaltine.

11:16.116 --> 11:18.072
He's a pug, a patsy, a hack.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.308
Cynthia would not date a hack.

11:20.476 --> 11:22.467
Would. Does. Is.

11:25.276 --> 11:26.675
Before we get started...

11:26.836 --> 11:28.986
...I am happy to tell you
that Eddie Sherman...

11:29.156 --> 11:31.192
...is no longer writing
for this catalogue.

11:31.356 --> 11:33.392
- It's about time.
- He's upstairs.

11:33.556 --> 11:35.865
I made him director
of corporate development.

11:36.436 --> 11:38.028
You promoted him?

11:38.196 --> 11:39.515
Well, no. I would hardly...

11:39.676 --> 11:43.908
- I bust my hump every day.
- Relax.

11:44.076 --> 11:47.910
As far as I'm concerned,
you and your deranged protégé...

11:48.076 --> 11:50.795
...can run the catalogue
by yourselves.

11:50.956 --> 11:52.435
I quit!

11:52.596 --> 11:53.790
- I'm with him.
- Me too.

11:53.956 --> 11:56.072
What? Hey.

11:56.476 --> 11:59.912
Hey. Hey!

12:01.676 --> 12:03.268
Chapter one.

12:03.436 --> 12:07.429
In order to manage risk,
we must first understand risk.

12:07.796 --> 12:09.514
How do you spot risk?

12:09.676 --> 12:13.510
How do you av oid risk,
and what mak es it so risky?

12:13.676 --> 12:16.588
- This guy sounds like me.
- To understand risk, we must first...

12:16.756 --> 12:18.747
...define risk. Risk...
- This is horrible.

12:18.916 --> 12:21.430
...existed virtually...
- Stop it. Stop it. Shut up!

12:22.316 --> 12:24.432
Come on, Frank, I need you.

12:24.596 --> 12:26.552
I mean, the war was 50 years ago.

12:26.716 --> 12:30.948
In my mind,
there's a war still going on.

12:31.116 --> 12:32.549
All right, what happened?

12:32.716 --> 12:34.627
What is it that you can't get over?

12:47.316 --> 12:50.467
Inchon, Korea, 1950.

12:50.636 --> 12:54.151
I was the best cook
Uncle Sam ever saw.

12:54.476 --> 12:57.991
Slinging hash for the fighting 103rd.

12:58.156 --> 13:01.751
As we marched north,
our supply lines were getting thin.

13:01.916 --> 13:04.384
Well, one day,
a couple of GI's found a crate.

13:04.556 --> 13:07.673
Inside was 600 pounds
of prime Texas steer.

13:07.836 --> 13:10.145
At least, it once was prime.

13:10.316 --> 13:12.193
The use date
was three weeks past.

13:13.036 --> 13:16.312
But I was arrogant. I was brash.

13:16.756 --> 13:20.032
I thought if I used
just the right spices...

13:22.276 --> 13:24.392
...cooked it long enough...

13:27.036 --> 13:28.230
What happened?

13:28.396 --> 13:31.433
I went too far. I overseasoned it.

13:34.956 --> 13:37.106
Men were keeling over
all around me.

13:38.556 --> 13:41.548
I can still hear
the retching and screaming.

13:48.876 --> 13:50.867
Frank!

13:51.516 --> 13:56.226
I sent 16 of my own men
to the latrines that night.

13:57.876 --> 13:59.355
They were just boys.

13:59.516 --> 14:01.711
Frank, you were a boy too.

14:01.876 --> 14:05.186
And it was war.
That was a crazy time for everyone.

14:05.396 --> 14:07.193
Tell that to Bobby Colby.

14:07.796 --> 14:12.916
All that kid wanted to do was go home.
Well, he went home, all right.

14:13.236 --> 14:15.750
With a crater in his colon
the size of a cutlet.

14:16.836 --> 14:19.555
They had to sit him on a cork
for the 18-hour flight home.

14:19.716 --> 14:24.107
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred
Jewish singles need you.

14:24.276 --> 14:26.551
This is your chance
to make it all right again.

14:26.956 --> 14:31.029
No. No. I'll never cook again.

14:31.196 --> 14:33.994
Never! Now get out of my house!

14:34.676 --> 14:37.793
Out. Get out. Go.

14:42.516 --> 14:45.189
So you saw Bania's act.

14:45.756 --> 14:48.145
He got two minutes
into that Ovaltine thing...

14:48.316 --> 14:50.784
...and I just couldn't take it anymore.

14:51.316 --> 14:55.070
I told you. It's like getting beaten
with a bag of oranges.

14:55.476 --> 14:57.512
Why is he so obsessed
with Ovaltine?

14:57.676 --> 15:01.510
He just thinks that anything
that dissolves in milk is funny.

15:01.676 --> 15:05.988
Anyway, Cynthia and I got into
this big argument afterwards...

15:06.316 --> 15:08.830
...and I think it's over.
- No more mentor?

15:08.996 --> 15:12.466
- Looks that way.
- At least you and I are okay again.

15:12.636 --> 15:14.354
Actually, I was kind of thinking...

15:14.516 --> 15:17.110
...that maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

15:17.276 --> 15:18.311
Why?

15:18.476 --> 15:21.434
Well, I'm feeling a little disoriented.

15:21.596 --> 15:24.064
It's just weird for me
not to have an advisor.

15:24.236 --> 15:26.875
I can tell you what to do.

15:28.076 --> 15:30.271
- It's more than that.
- I can tell you what to think.

15:31.276 --> 15:32.709
I need someone I can trust.

15:37.036 --> 15:40.312
I got a big problem here, Jerry.
The tapes are worthless.

15:40.476 --> 15:43.070
Kind of in the middle
of something here, George.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.025
- George.
- I gotta run anyway.

15:53.196 --> 15:56.108
I can't believe you feel
you really need a mentor.

15:56.276 --> 16:00.064
I just need someone who can give me
some kind of direction.

16:01.556 --> 16:03.353
I'll see you.

16:03.516 --> 16:05.108
Yeah, see you.

16:05.276 --> 16:08.791
- So, what's your problem?
- No problem.

16:11.116 --> 16:15.428
I think I got something here
for the Bengalese galoshes.

16:17.516 --> 16:21.270
"It's tough keeping your feet dry...

16:21.436 --> 16:24.553
...when you're kicking in a skull."

16:25.996 --> 16:30.035
You know, Eddie,
that might be just a tad harsh.

16:30.196 --> 16:32.073
For women's wear.

16:34.116 --> 16:36.949
Well, I'm not married to it.

16:37.596 --> 16:42.545
Well, in that case,
why don't we take the phrase:

16:43.276 --> 16:44.709
"Kicking in a skull"...

16:44.876 --> 16:47.310
...and we tweak it.

16:47.476 --> 16:51.435
You know, just a hair,
to something like what?

16:51.596 --> 16:55.748
Like "strolling through
a dewy meadow."

16:56.596 --> 16:58.951
Dewy meadow.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.269
Here's your omelette.

17:03.796 --> 17:06.628
- It's dry.
- That's the way I always make it.

17:07.516 --> 17:09.507
Well, it sucks.

17:11.435 --> 17:13.347
What did you say?

17:13.556 --> 17:17.231
Your meatloaf is mushy,
your salmon croquettes are oily...

17:17.396 --> 17:20.627
...and your eggplant parmigiana
is a disgrace to this house!

17:20.796 --> 17:25.506
Well, that's too bad, because I'm
the only one who cooks around here.

17:25.675 --> 17:28.986
Not anymore. Give me that spatula.

17:32.956 --> 17:35.516
I'm back, baby!

17:37.596 --> 17:40.588
You're sure, with your schedule,
you'd have time for a protégé?

17:40.956 --> 17:44.471
I'll make time. Because, Abby,
I was once like you.

17:44.636 --> 17:46.115
Wide-eyed, naive.

17:46.276 --> 17:49.348
I didn't know the first thing
about a subject as fundamental...

17:49.516 --> 17:53.065
...as risk management.

17:53.236 --> 17:55.431
I'm not familiar with it.
You'll have to explain.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.268
I'll tell you what.

17:57.436 --> 17:59.347
Why don't you read this book...

17:59.516 --> 18:02.952
...and let's just see
if you can explain it to me.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.825
- All right.
- Okay.

18:06.796 --> 18:07.990
Hey, Jerry.

18:08.396 --> 18:10.785
- Hey, Bania.
- Did you hear what happened?

18:10.956 --> 18:13.675
The mentor saw my act.
She dumped me.

18:13.836 --> 18:15.269
Oh, that's a tough one.

18:15.436 --> 18:19.111
Maybe she's right.
Maybe I am a complete hack.

18:19.316 --> 18:21.671
I'm the absolute worst.
The worst, Jerry.

18:21.836 --> 18:24.589
Well, it's just that you got
so many things with the milk.

18:24.756 --> 18:27.316
You got that Bosco bit,
you got your Nestlé's Quik bit.

18:27.476 --> 18:29.034
By the time you get to Ovaltine...

18:29.196 --> 18:31.790
You think you can give me
a hand with my material?

18:38.556 --> 18:41.389
- You still need a cook?
- Oh, yeah. Come on in, Frank.

18:41.556 --> 18:43.194
- You got T-Fal?
- Calphalon.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.314
- No. Follow me.
- Oh, yeah.

18:47.516 --> 18:48.949
Try that.

18:51.316 --> 18:53.511
"Why do they call it Ovaltine?

18:53.676 --> 18:56.748
The mug is round, the jar is round.

18:56.916 --> 18:59.225
They should call it Roundtine."

19:00.836 --> 19:03.794
That's gold, Jerry. Gold.

19:04.556 --> 19:10.791
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel"
and "scar tissue"...

19:11.276 --> 19:15.588
...with "string of pearls"
and "raspberry scones."

19:19.036 --> 19:20.754
George Costanza is your mentor?

19:20.916 --> 19:22.952
Yeah. He's great.

19:23.116 --> 19:24.629
I am learning so much.

19:24.796 --> 19:27.913
About what? How to calculate
5 percent of a restaurant check?

19:28.996 --> 19:30.475
You know what your problem is?

19:30.636 --> 19:34.026
You just have no respect
for the protégé-mentor relationship.

19:34.196 --> 19:37.666
As a matter of fact,
I happen to have a protégé of my own.

19:39.436 --> 19:42.109
- Who?
- A Mr. Kenneth Bania.

19:42.276 --> 19:43.914
Bania?

19:44.836 --> 19:47.396
I'm gonna mentor
this kid to the top.

19:47.556 --> 19:51.629
Well, I don't think I wanna date
a mentor whose protégé is a hack.

19:51.796 --> 19:54.947
I don't think I wanna date a protégé
whose mentor is a Costanza.

19:56.876 --> 19:57.911
I don't know how...

19:58.076 --> 20:00.112
...but there's some chemistry
between us.

20:00.276 --> 20:02.471
We turned out
one hell of a catalogue.

20:02.996 --> 20:04.190
Cool.

20:05.316 --> 20:07.511
Hey, Ed, let me ask you something.

20:07.676 --> 20:12.033
What's with the fatigues
and all the psychotic imagery, huh?

20:12.756 --> 20:14.030
I don't wanna talk about it.

20:14.196 --> 20:17.666
Come on. Don't be a baby.

20:18.436 --> 20:22.509
I went out on a couple of dates
with this woman.

20:22.676 --> 20:24.826
I thought she really liked me.

20:25.396 --> 20:29.230
And then things kind of cooled off.

20:31.116 --> 20:32.310
That's it?

20:32.796 --> 20:35.435
Well, it's tough
meeting somebody you like...

20:35.596 --> 20:37.188
...let alone somebody Jewish.

20:44.716 --> 20:46.229
This food is fantastic.

20:46.396 --> 20:49.991
- Have you tried the hamantaschen?
- I can't get off the kishkes.

20:50.156 --> 20:51.953
- Hey, Jerry.
- Bania.

20:52.116 --> 20:53.674
I just stopped by to thank you.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.714
That risk-management stuff
you wrote for me is killer.

20:57.116 --> 20:58.515
Risk management?

20:58.676 --> 21:00.906
It's gold, Jerry. Gold.

21:01.076 --> 21:04.148
I got all these corporate gigs,
and even Cynthia took me back.

21:04.316 --> 21:05.715
You went from the mailroom...

21:05.876 --> 21:08.549
...to director of corporate
development in two days?

21:09.396 --> 21:11.671
- That's right.
- How much are they paying you?

21:11.836 --> 21:13.064
I'll double it.

21:15.156 --> 21:18.831
- These latkes are going like hotcakes.
- Where's the powdered sugar?

21:19.436 --> 21:20.994
You know, you could take a break.

21:21.156 --> 21:25.195
No breaks. I feel reborn.
I'm like a phoenix rising from Arizona.

21:26.476 --> 21:27.625
Quitting?

21:27.796 --> 21:31.266
I can't churn out
that pointless drivel anymore.

21:31.436 --> 21:34.587
What...? You can't quit.
You're all I've got.

21:34.756 --> 21:36.747
I need you.

21:38.156 --> 21:39.874
Gross.

21:53.196 --> 21:54.675
No!

21:55.156 --> 21:57.954
No! Don't eat it. It's no good.

21:58.116 --> 22:01.347
- No good. No good. No way.
- Frank, stop it.

22:01.516 --> 22:04.826
- Stop...
- No. No. No.

22:04.996 --> 22:06.668
Frank!

22:12.916 --> 22:16.955
Our next speaker is George Costanza
on the subject of risk management.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.467
"Ovaltine.

22:37.116 --> 22:39.505
Have you ever had this stuff?

22:42.036 --> 22:44.675
Why do they call it Ovaltine?

22:49.556 --> 22:51.433
They should call it Roundtine.

22:53.236 --> 22:55.545
You know what I'm talking about."

22:56.956 --> 22:59.311
He's my protégé.

23:15.282 --> 23:17.716
You seen commercials for
indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC.

23:17.882 --> 23:19.076
Tagamet HB?

23:19.242 --> 23:20.721
Country's sick to their stomachs.

23:20.882 --> 23:23.840
You know you're supposed to take
these things before you get sick?

23:24.002 --> 23:25.674
- What is this, a bit?
- No.

23:25.842 --> 23:28.197
- Because I'm not in the mood.
- We're just talking.

23:28.362 --> 23:30.478
Is this not the greatest
marketing ploy ever?

23:30.642 --> 23:32.553
If you feel good,
you're supposed to take one.

23:32.722 --> 23:34.075
I know that tone. This is a bit.

23:34.242 --> 23:37.359
They've opened a whole new market.
Medication for the well.

23:37.522 --> 23:40.355
All right. Are you done
with your little amusement?

23:40.522 --> 23:41.955
Then you admit it was amusing?

23:42.122 --> 23:44.955
It was okay. But move the
"medication for the well" to the front...

23:45.122 --> 23:46.601
...and hit the word "good" harder.

23:46.762 --> 23:48.559
Great. Thanks.

23:54.322 --> 23:57.280
So your firm designed
all the furniture in here?

23:57.442 --> 23:59.273
Well, we manufacture it.

23:59.442 --> 24:01.478
The original designs
are by Karl Farbman.

24:01.642 --> 24:03.394
Oh, Farbman.

24:03.562 --> 24:06.235
- Do you know Farbman?
- Love Farbman.

24:06.522 --> 24:09.514
Most people go their whole lives
without sitting in a Farbman.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.912
Well, if you call that living.

24:15.202 --> 24:18.160
Wouldn't it be great if
Farbman designed shoes?

24:18.322 --> 24:22.076
Brett? Don't you think
that would be great? Brett?

24:22.242 --> 24:24.278
After the song, babe.

24:25.562 --> 24:27.200
This song.

24:32.322 --> 24:33.880
So when do I meet this jerk?

24:34.042 --> 24:37.273
He's not a jerk, Jer.
He only works with Karl Farbman.

24:37.442 --> 24:39.398
- Who?
- I don't know. Some designer.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.951
Anyway, Brett
is so generous and sensitive.

24:42.122 --> 24:44.317
Last night he was moved
just listening to a song.

24:44.482 --> 24:45.881
- What song?
- "Desperado."

24:46.042 --> 24:47.919
"Desperado"?
And you're still dating him?

24:48.082 --> 24:49.959
I'll tell you who sounds
a little desperado.

24:51.482 --> 24:53.313
See that salesman
twirling that umbrella?

24:53.482 --> 24:56.076
- I invented that.
- That had to be invented?

24:56.242 --> 24:58.358
When I started out as a comedian,
I sold umbrellas.

24:58.522 --> 25:01.958
It was my idea to twirl it
to attract customers.

25:02.122 --> 25:05.751
Oh, really? Well, why don't
we ask him about it?

25:06.162 --> 25:08.153
- Elaine.
- Excuse me.

25:08.322 --> 25:09.675
Hey, how you doing?

25:09.842 --> 25:13.721
My friend here says that he invented
that little twirl you're doing.

25:13.882 --> 25:16.350
Elaine, please,
it was a long time ago.

25:16.522 --> 25:18.274
The man doesn't want
a history lesson.

25:18.442 --> 25:20.319
Teddy Padilac
came up with this twirl.

25:21.042 --> 25:22.475
I know Teddy Padilac.

25:22.642 --> 25:24.872
I worked with him on 48th and Sixth.

25:25.042 --> 25:26.475
That's where he come up with it.

25:26.642 --> 25:29.361
- In his dreams.
- All right. Can we go?

25:29.522 --> 25:33.231
By the way, you're doing it too fast.
You'll disorient the customers.

25:36.242 --> 25:39.040
It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.

25:39.882 --> 25:41.713
I find it disorienting.

25:41.882 --> 25:43.361
Who buys an umbrella anyway?

25:43.522 --> 25:46.719
You can get them for free
in the coffee shop in the metal cans.

25:46.882 --> 25:49.032
Those belong to people.

25:52.482 --> 25:56.395
Hey. Well, this was
downstairs for you.

25:56.562 --> 25:58.120
Oh, no, not more checks.

25:58.282 --> 26:00.352
They're coming in faster
than I can sign them.

26:00.522 --> 26:02.001
- What checks?
- Oh, you didn't hear?

26:02.162 --> 26:03.959
Jerry's a big star in Japan.

26:04.162 --> 26:05.800
Don't know why.
There's a clip of me...

26:05.962 --> 26:08.430
...in the credits of some
Japanese comedy.

26:08.602 --> 26:10.752
Yeah, The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

26:11.762 --> 26:14.674
They run it all the time. I'm starting
to get these royalty checks.

26:14.882 --> 26:16.554
Look at all of those. You're rich.

26:16.722 --> 26:18.440
No, each one is for like 12 cents.

26:18.602 --> 26:21.036
It's barely worth the pain
in my hand to sign them.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.520
Jerry, you need any new furniture?

26:29.682 --> 26:31.434
- Why?
- Elaine's new boyfriend, you know...

26:31.602 --> 26:33.718
...he's giving me
this oversized chest of drawers.

26:33.882 --> 26:35.918
- It's a Farbman.
- He's giving you furniture?

26:36.082 --> 26:38.755
- Who is this guy?
- Who are any of her losers?

26:38.922 --> 26:40.640
You're on that list.

26:41.442 --> 26:44.240
I gotta go home and open up
the house for the carpet cleaners.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.393
You know, they're doing
my whole place for $25?

26:46.562 --> 26:49.440
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

26:49.602 --> 26:52.196
- Yeah. You heard of them?
- They're a crazy religious cult.

26:52.362 --> 26:56.037
The carpet cleaning is just a means
for them to get into your apartment.

26:56.362 --> 26:59.399
So? For a $25 cleaning, I can listen
to some pointless blather.

26:59.562 --> 27:01.871
I do it. I'm not even
getting the cleaning.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.192
I signed over 100 checks
this morning.

27:05.362 --> 27:08.001
- Hello, $12.
- Excuse me.

27:08.242 --> 27:09.800
Would you take a picture, please.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.600
Oh, yeah. Sure.

27:13.122 --> 27:14.714
I'm gonna ask this guy something.

27:18.242 --> 27:20.437
Hey, nice twirl you got there.

27:20.602 --> 27:22.320
You know who invented that,
don't you?

27:22.482 --> 27:24.438
- Hey, are you folks from Japan?
- Yes.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.234
You recognize that mug?

27:26.402 --> 27:28.074
That's the funny face
that greets you...

27:28.242 --> 27:30.472
...at the beginning of
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

27:30.642 --> 27:33.076
- Oh, Super Terrific!
- Yeah.

27:33.242 --> 27:35.039
Yeah, huh? Yeah, that's him.

27:35.482 --> 27:36.710
What is he doing?

27:37.082 --> 27:40.074
Well, I don't know,
but something super-terrific, I'm sure.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.039
- That's funny.
- Oh, yeah, very funny.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.478
And it wouldn't be impolite
to laugh at his antics.

27:47.362 --> 27:50.638
Yeah, that's it. Because everybody
laughs at Jerry here in America.

27:56.162 --> 27:57.595
We're pretty much finished.

27:58.642 --> 27:59.916
There's just one more thing.

28:00.082 --> 28:01.993
Here it comes.

28:04.562 --> 28:07.030
You forgot to sign your check.

28:08.922 --> 28:10.355
Sorry.

28:11.602 --> 28:15.675
You sure there isn't anything else?

28:16.282 --> 28:17.840
No.

28:19.082 --> 28:20.913
So that's it?

28:21.082 --> 28:24.597
- Unless you need a receipt.
- I wish that was all I needed.

28:24.762 --> 28:26.036
Life can be so confusing.

28:26.202 --> 28:27.999
I'm searching
for answers anywhere.

28:28.162 --> 28:29.834
Good luck with that.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.119
Hey.

28:37.282 --> 28:41.036
- What's with the claw?
- Super-terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.

28:41.362 --> 28:43.671
- There's no sign of Kramer.
- Oh, Brett.

28:43.842 --> 28:45.514
- This is Jerry.
- Hi.

28:46.122 --> 28:48.795
That's very funny. Elaine told me
you're some kind of comedian.

28:48.962 --> 28:50.793
I'm one kind.

28:51.602 --> 28:53.991
Have you seen the chest of drawers
Brett gave to Kramer?

28:54.162 --> 28:56.471
- Fleckman. Right.
- Farbman.

28:57.122 --> 28:59.761
- You gotta see them. They're beautiful.
- I'm sure they are.

28:59.922 --> 29:02.755
I'd be happy to get you some,
if that's what you're driving at.

29:03.282 --> 29:06.399
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Don't worry. It's no charge to you.

29:06.562 --> 29:09.838
Looks like what you really need is
a decent desk for writing your skits.

29:10.002 --> 29:11.401
I don't write skits.

29:11.562 --> 29:13.996
Of course you don't.
You don't have a proper workstation.

29:14.162 --> 29:15.675
I'll fax over my catalogue.

29:16.722 --> 29:21.671
Brett, Jerry doesn't have
a fax machine.

29:24.522 --> 29:26.433
I'm sure things will pick up
for you soon.

29:28.002 --> 29:29.640
Elaine, maybe we should get going.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.997
- Wanna join us?
- Where you going, the coffee shop?

29:32.162 --> 29:35.518
The coffee shop? I think we can
do a little better than that.

29:35.682 --> 29:38.640
You look like you could use
a solid meal at a real restaurant.

29:39.082 --> 29:41.835
- You look like you could use a...
- Jerry.

29:44.482 --> 29:48.236
Three hundred dollars. Mr. Oh, how
much would these run you in Tokyo?

29:49.562 --> 29:51.359
Those are 30,000 yen.

29:51.522 --> 29:53.319
Thirty thousand?

29:53.482 --> 29:55.837
Well, these are practically free.

29:56.482 --> 29:59.713
Giddy up. You're a cowboy now.

30:02.242 --> 30:04.233
I feel terrible about
your friend Jerry.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.632
He's upset that I gave Kramer
that chest of drawers.

30:06.802 --> 30:08.155
Why do you think he's upset?

30:08.322 --> 30:11.473
Well, how could he not be? Living in
that cramped little apartment...

30:11.642 --> 30:15.681
...that outdated furniture,
so terribly un-Karl-Farbman-like.

30:15.842 --> 30:19.915
We're not gonna talk about
Karl Farbman all night, are we?

30:20.082 --> 30:21.640
I hope not.

30:25.402 --> 30:28.235
Brett, is everything all right?

30:28.842 --> 30:30.400
What is it?
Is there someone outside?

30:30.762 --> 30:32.081
Elaine, the song.

30:36.082 --> 30:38.232
For a minute, I thought
it was that urban legend...

30:38.402 --> 30:40.393
...about the guy with the hook
hanging on the...

30:40.562 --> 30:43.235
Elaine, could you just not talk
for one minute?

30:44.362 --> 30:45.841
Sorry.

30:51.722 --> 30:53.280
- No spiel?
- Not a peep.

30:53.442 --> 30:55.194
They just cleaned the carpets
and left.

30:55.362 --> 30:57.318
They call themselves a cult.

30:57.762 --> 31:00.481
So you're angry
that this bizarre carpet cabal...

31:00.642 --> 31:02.075
...made no attempt to abduct you?

31:02.242 --> 31:03.914
They could have at least tried.

31:04.282 --> 31:06.876
Maybe they thought you looked
too smart to be brainwashed.

31:07.042 --> 31:08.680
- Please.
- Too dumb?

31:10.642 --> 31:14.954
Well, Mackie's back in town.
Nice duds.

31:15.722 --> 31:17.713
Yeah, it's a gift
from my Japanese friends.

31:17.882 --> 31:19.520
They're known as gift-givers.

31:19.682 --> 31:22.242
And tonight, we're going dancing
at the Rainbow Room.

31:22.802 --> 31:24.758
Sounds like you're throwing
their money around.

31:24.922 --> 31:26.878
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese.

31:27.042 --> 31:29.317
I mean, that TV you watch,
that sushi you eat...

31:29.482 --> 31:30.801
...even that kimono you wear...

31:30.962 --> 31:33.157
...where do you think
all that money goes?

31:33.522 --> 31:35.240
That's right.

31:35.402 --> 31:36.835
How'd you hook up with
these guys?

31:37.002 --> 31:39.470
They recognized Jerry from
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

31:39.642 --> 31:41.678
See, you should be doing
your own show in Japan.

31:41.842 --> 31:43.036
Now, they get you.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.920
What kind of show am I gonna do
in Japan?

31:45.082 --> 31:46.879
What did you do with
that pilot you did?

31:47.042 --> 31:48.873
Yeah, the pilot.

31:49.042 --> 31:50.873
Right. That had
marvellous production values.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.953
I do a lot of business with
Japanese TV.

31:53.122 --> 31:54.919
They broadcast
a lot of American baseball.

31:55.082 --> 31:56.720
They got an office here
in New York.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.601
Forget it. The pilot was awful.
It failed.

31:59.762 --> 32:02.322
It failed here. Because here
every time you turn on a TV...

32:02.482 --> 32:05.360
...all you see is four morons
sitting around an apartment...

32:05.522 --> 32:06.955
...whining about their dates.

32:07.122 --> 32:10.239
See, George is right, Jerry.
See, here you're just another apple.

32:10.402 --> 32:15.601
But in Japan, you're an exotic fruit,
like an orange, which is rare there.

32:19.522 --> 32:20.716
You had a date?

32:20.882 --> 32:24.113
You went out with my butler? Who
said you could go out with my butler?

32:24.282 --> 32:28.070
- Why do I need your permission?
- Because he's my butler.

32:31.682 --> 32:34.913
So, what do you think?

32:35.082 --> 32:37.073
We're a bit confused.

32:37.242 --> 32:40.234
Why was this man Jerry's butler?

32:40.922 --> 32:43.561
You see, the man
who is the butler...

32:43.722 --> 32:46.634
...had gotten into
a car accident with Jerry.

32:46.802 --> 32:49.475
And because he didn't have
any insurance...

32:49.642 --> 32:53.760
...the judge decreed that
the man become Jerry's butler.

32:53.922 --> 32:56.356
Is this customary in
your legal system?

32:56.722 --> 33:00.556
No. That's what makes it
such a humorous situation.

33:10.322 --> 33:14.634
I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr. Seinfeld is
very funny to Americans.

33:14.802 --> 33:19.273
But I'm not sure this butler show
would work in Japan.

33:19.442 --> 33:21.080
Oh, l... I disagree.

33:21.242 --> 33:24.154
You've... You've been living
in America too long.

33:24.322 --> 33:28.235
You've forgotten what it's like
to have no oranges.

33:33.322 --> 33:34.960
Sorry. My hand is numb.

33:35.122 --> 33:39.912
Yes, from endorsing checks for
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

33:40.082 --> 33:42.596
You must go.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.194
Well, I think
I'm on the outs with Brett.

33:49.802 --> 33:51.918
I got shushed during "Desperado."

33:52.682 --> 33:55.116
What does he listen to,
the all "Desperado" station?

33:55.762 --> 33:58.959
He is just in his own world
when he hears that song.

33:59.122 --> 34:03.718
It's like I'm sitting there in the car,
and he's out riding fences.

34:03.882 --> 34:05.998
You know, what you need is
a song you can share.

34:06.562 --> 34:10.440
Yeah, you're right.
We need to find our song.

34:10.601 --> 34:13.514
Okay. So is there any song
that you feel very strongly about?

34:16.402 --> 34:17.630
I like "Witchy Woman."

34:17.802 --> 34:20.396
- "Witchy Woman"?
- You know, "Witchy Woman."

34:23.282 --> 34:24.715
Oh, "Witchy Woman."

34:26.522 --> 34:27.716
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hey.

34:27.882 --> 34:29.440
Hey, how was the Rainbow Room?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.001
Well, we... We had to leave early.

34:31.161 --> 34:35.280
There was a slight monetary
discrepancy regarding the bill.

34:35.442 --> 34:38.161
- Listen, could I borrow some pillows?
- What for?

34:38.322 --> 34:41.041
Well, my Japanese friends
are gonna stay with me.

34:41.202 --> 34:43.272
I thought they all had suites
at the Plaza.

34:43.722 --> 34:48.237
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry. We all don't
have checks rolling in like you do.

34:48.402 --> 34:51.599
Well, what about all that money
from the kimonos I wear?

34:52.442 --> 34:53.795
Well, they ran out of it.

34:53.962 --> 34:57.671
I mean, Manhattan can be quite
pricey, even with 50,000 yen.

34:57.842 --> 35:01.312
Fifty thousand yen?
Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?

35:01.682 --> 35:03.320
Evidently.

35:04.562 --> 35:07.440
Oh, by the way, tell Brett that
his chest of drawers are a big hit.

35:07.602 --> 35:09.752
My guests are
very comfortable in them.

35:10.082 --> 35:11.640
In them?

35:12.802 --> 35:15.077
You have them sleeping in drawers?

35:15.282 --> 35:18.513
Jerry, have you ever seen
the business hotels in Tokyo?

35:18.682 --> 35:21.594
They sleep in tiny,
stacked cubicles all the time.

35:21.762 --> 35:24.640
- They feel right at home.
- This has international incident...

35:24.802 --> 35:27.111
...written all over it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

35:31.402 --> 35:34.280
- Good night, Mr. Tanaka.
- Good night.

35:34.442 --> 35:37.002
- Good night, Mr. Oh.
- Good night.

35:37.922 --> 35:40.117
Good night, Mr. Yamaguchi.

35:51.362 --> 35:53.512
- What is this?
- Rice Krispies.

35:53.682 --> 35:55.081
East meets West, Jerry.

35:56.122 --> 35:59.239
That's a lovely little
bureau-and-breakfast you're running.

35:59.402 --> 36:00.630
Well, I'm off to the bank.

36:06.682 --> 36:08.001
Elaine, l...

36:08.362 --> 36:09.761
What do you think?

36:11.482 --> 36:12.756
What are you doing?

36:12.922 --> 36:15.436
That's "Witchy Woman."
I thought it could be our song.

36:16.162 --> 36:18.960
"Witchy Woman" is okay for you,
but I've already got a song.

36:19.522 --> 36:21.353
Oh, well, then how about
"Desperado"?

36:21.522 --> 36:22.796
We can share it.

36:23.002 --> 36:25.391
No. It's mine.

36:29.362 --> 36:32.672
Here you go.
Snap, crackle and pop.

36:36.722 --> 36:40.476
Good morning, Mr. Oh.
I gotta make up the drawer.

36:40.642 --> 36:42.917
Come back in half-hour.

36:50.482 --> 36:53.155
- Hey, I'll take one.
- Well, look who's back.

36:53.322 --> 36:56.553
Teddy, this is the guy says
he invented the twirl.

36:56.922 --> 36:58.594
Jerry Seinfeld.

36:58.762 --> 37:00.992
Teddy Padilac, long time, no see.

37:01.162 --> 37:02.754
What do you got
in a push-button mini?

37:02.922 --> 37:05.914
Same thing we had when
you bailed on us 15 years ago.

37:06.082 --> 37:08.880
Bailed? Come on, you knew
I wanted to be a comedian.

37:09.042 --> 37:12.079
Besides, we had some good times.
Remember Tropical Storm Renee?

37:12.242 --> 37:15.314
Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you
during the poncho craze of '84?

37:15.482 --> 37:17.120
I almost lost my house.

37:17.762 --> 37:19.275
Umbrella, buddy?

37:19.442 --> 37:22.195
Now we got that damn
urban sombrero to contend with.

37:22.362 --> 37:23.556
Easy, Clicky.

37:23.722 --> 37:25.633
I hear you're taking credit
for the twirl.

37:25.802 --> 37:27.918
Oh, it's so many years ago.
Who cares?

37:28.082 --> 37:30.550
I care. Clicky cares.

37:30.722 --> 37:34.158
- Look, could I just buy an umbrella?
- Yeah, sure.

37:34.322 --> 37:36.074
- Two hundred dollars.
- What?

37:36.242 --> 37:38.802
Special price for a real
foul-weather friend.

37:43.322 --> 37:45.916
Hey, George. All right,
how about that tour, huh?

37:46.082 --> 37:47.913
These guys are ready to
run the bases.

37:48.082 --> 37:51.358
Kramer, it's... It's raining.
They got the tarp on the field.

37:52.322 --> 37:54.677
Listen, George, what else
can I do with these guys?

37:54.842 --> 37:56.958
Bear in mind,
they're a little light on the yen.

37:58.362 --> 38:00.717
Well, l... I got the pilot
of the Jerry show.

38:00.922 --> 38:03.390
That's perfect.
How would you guys like to watch...

38:03.562 --> 38:06.395
...the Super Terrific Happy star,
Jerry Seinfeld?

38:06.562 --> 38:08.712
But we are also very hungry.

38:08.882 --> 38:11.476
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you guys
just watch the tape...

38:11.642 --> 38:13.155
...and I'll get you some food.

38:13.322 --> 38:15.153
- Go ahead. Yeah.
- Please.

38:15.322 --> 38:17.313
Hey, peanuts!

38:17.762 --> 38:19.753
George. George, got a minute?

38:19.962 --> 38:22.078
George, did you call some
carpet cleaners?

38:22.282 --> 38:24.352
- Are they here?
- They're in my office right now.

38:24.522 --> 38:26.797
- They haven't said anything to you?
- About what?

38:26.962 --> 38:29.351
What kind of a snobby,
stuck-up cult is this?

38:36.402 --> 38:39.553
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Brett.

38:39.722 --> 38:41.314
Haven't you ever
heard of an umbrella?

38:41.482 --> 38:43.120
I didn't have enough money.

38:43.602 --> 38:46.639
- Sure things will pick up for you.
- No, it's not that. It's...

38:48.602 --> 38:52.390
Oh, no. Look at the checks.
Hours of hard work ruined.

38:52.562 --> 38:55.599
Don't worry.
I can spot you the 12 cents.

38:55.762 --> 38:56.956
No. It's not the money.

38:57.122 --> 39:00.034
It's my hand.
It's crippled from writing and writing.

39:00.202 --> 39:01.760
Nothing's working for you, is it?

39:01.922 --> 39:03.355
Not at the moment, Brett.

39:03.522 --> 39:05.911
I'd give you a ride,
but I got Karl Farbman here.

39:07.242 --> 39:08.880
Thanks for stopping.

39:10.602 --> 39:13.594
Brett said you ran away from him
as if he were the boogity man?

39:13.762 --> 39:14.956
Bogeyman.

39:16.162 --> 39:18.312
- Boogie?
- I'm quite sure.

39:19.722 --> 39:21.678
Anyway, any luck
getting together on a song?

39:21.842 --> 39:24.402
No. He blew out my
"Witchy Woman."

39:24.562 --> 39:26.154
And he won't share "Desperado."

39:26.322 --> 39:28.153
Hey, what do you think of
"Oye Como Va"?

39:29.362 --> 39:32.035
Well, I'm running out of guys
here in this city, Jer.

39:34.842 --> 39:36.400
Hey, great news.

39:36.562 --> 39:39.918
I showed the pilot to Kramer's
Japanese friends. They loved it!

39:40.082 --> 39:41.959
Really? They bought
the butler character?

39:42.122 --> 39:44.716
Did I tell you that story's relatable?
That was a great show.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.918
That is why I'm bringing it
back to NBC.

39:47.082 --> 39:49.277
- NBC?
- Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.

39:51.762 --> 39:53.832
But they told us we must go now.

39:54.002 --> 39:56.436
Yeah, but now I have
my own market research.

39:56.602 --> 39:59.116
Actual Japanese viewers
that loved the show.

39:59.282 --> 40:01.591
- I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
- Hey, George, do me a favour.

40:01.762 --> 40:04.879
If they make you an offer,
whatever it is, just take it.

40:07.282 --> 40:10.592
Hey, by the way
what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?

40:10.762 --> 40:12.320
- Who?
- The network executive.

40:12.482 --> 40:14.393
Do you think she liked me?

40:24.762 --> 40:26.673
Hey, look at who's here!

40:26.842 --> 40:28.719
George, come on in. Come on.

40:28.882 --> 40:30.998
- I want you to come in here.
- Come on in, fat boy!

40:31.162 --> 40:34.154
Get a good night's sleep,
all right, fellas? Big day tomorrow.

40:34.762 --> 40:36.241
All right.

40:42.322 --> 40:43.960
Last one.

40:49.482 --> 40:51.234
Here you are.

40:51.842 --> 40:53.753
- Where's the boys?
- No, I let them sleep in.

40:53.922 --> 40:56.231
I'm on my way to cash in
their plane tickets for them.

40:56.402 --> 40:57.835
They need a little food money.

40:58.002 --> 41:01.039
- The meeting starts in 10 minutes.
- Well, I set their alarm.

41:01.202 --> 41:03.591
But they did have a lot of sake
in that hot tub.

41:03.922 --> 41:05.321
I'm calling Jerry.

41:09.522 --> 41:10.716
- Yeah?
- Jerry!

41:10.882 --> 41:12.554
The Japanese guys had sake
in the hot tub.

41:12.722 --> 41:14.075
You gotta get them down here...

41:14.242 --> 41:16.710
...or I don't have a focus group
to sell the pilot.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.351
Uncle Leo?

41:19.522 --> 41:20.716
Jerry!

41:21.642 --> 41:24.076
All right, all right. I'll wake them up.

41:25.162 --> 41:26.561
Testy.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.321
Hello?

41:31.482 --> 41:35.953
- Mr. Jerry, open the drawer, please.
- It's stuck.

41:37.042 --> 41:39.317
The steam from the hot tub
must have warped the wood.

41:39.482 --> 41:41.200
- Pull harder.
- I'm trying.

41:41.362 --> 41:44.160
I can't get a grip.
My hand's had kind of a bad week.

41:44.322 --> 41:46.153
Very funny. But no joking, please.

41:46.682 --> 41:48.001
Don't worry, I'll get you out.

41:48.762 --> 41:50.992
Brett, believe me,
you don't have to do this.

41:51.162 --> 41:53.039
Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this.

41:53.202 --> 41:55.762
It's not as nice
as Kramer's cabinets, but it's a start.

41:55.922 --> 41:59.631
Well, I promise you, Jerry is not
jealous of Kramer's cabinets.

41:59.802 --> 42:01.952
Move to the back of the drawers!

42:02.122 --> 42:03.760
Jerry?

42:04.242 --> 42:05.516
Jerry.

42:05.962 --> 42:08.396
Not the Farbman!

42:33.522 --> 42:36.480
So, gentlemen, we have a deal?

42:48.242 --> 42:51.359
Excuse me. Did you hire
the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

42:51.562 --> 42:56.431
Yes. To clean up the coffee stain
left by Jerry Seinfeld.

42:59.642 --> 43:04.397
Mr... Mr. Wilhelm, what?
What are you doing here?

43:04.682 --> 43:06.638
I'm here to clean the carpets.

43:06.802 --> 43:11.876
Most of the world is carpeted,
and one day, we will do the cleaning.

43:15.082 --> 43:16.561
Him, you brainwashed?

43:16.722 --> 43:18.155
What's he got that I don't have?

43:20.642 --> 43:22.234
Mr. Wilhelm, you've been abducted.

43:22.402 --> 43:24.074
Mr. Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me.

43:24.242 --> 43:25.834
Wilhelm?

43:27.242 --> 43:29.802
My name is Tanya.

43:45.842 --> 43:47.673
Brett, I'm... I'm really sorry.

43:47.882 --> 43:51.113
I didn't mean to hit you
in the head with an axe.

43:52.722 --> 43:54.713
At least it was just a handle.

43:55.082 --> 43:56.561
Those beautiful cabinets.

43:57.122 --> 43:58.874
What am I gonna tell...?

43:59.202 --> 44:01.636
- I can't remember his name.
- Fleckman?

44:01.802 --> 44:03.076
Calm down, Brett. Okay?

44:03.242 --> 44:06.712
You could have a concussion.
Calm down.

44:27.362 --> 44:30.081
- His pulse is fine.
- Looks like a minor concussion.

44:30.242 --> 44:33.234
Let me see what I can do
to relieve the swelling.

44:36.122 --> 44:37.840
Doctor?

44:39.082 --> 44:40.481
Doctor?

44:41.522 --> 44:43.240
Doctor?

44:45.082 --> 44:47.755
Doctor, I think we're losing him.

45:10.722 --> 45:13.680
A dollar eighty-nine.
Why is this $1.89?

45:13.842 --> 45:15.798
Why is there no
haggling in this country?

45:15.962 --> 45:18.954
We like to think we've progressed
beyond a knife fight for a drink.

45:19.122 --> 45:21.716
Not me.
Everything should be negotiable.

45:21.882 --> 45:23.759
- Restaurants too?
- Absolutely.

45:23.922 --> 45:26.800
Are you telling me there is
no room to move on pasta?

45:26.962 --> 45:28.759
All starches are a scam.

45:29.202 --> 45:31.318
Yeah, especially ziti,
with that big hole.

45:32.762 --> 45:34.115
Excuse me. How much is this?

45:34.282 --> 45:36.398
- A dollar nineteen.
- I'll give you a quarter.

45:36.562 --> 45:38.041
Get the hell out of here.

45:38.202 --> 45:40.670
- Tell him 40 and no fork.
- Thirty.

45:40.842 --> 45:43.072
That's it. You leave
and never come back.

45:43.242 --> 45:45.312
How about we leave
and come back in a week?

45:45.482 --> 45:46.756
Deal.

45:47.482 --> 45:50.280
All right. See?
We got something there.

45:54.562 --> 45:55.836
Oh, check it out.

45:56.402 --> 45:58.996
Kenny Rogers Roasters
finally opened.

45:59.162 --> 46:02.472
Hey, look at the size of
that neon chicken on the roof.

46:02.642 --> 46:04.280
Rogers can't sell chicken around here.

46:04.442 --> 46:06.114
We got chicken places
on every block.

46:06.282 --> 46:08.398
He is The Gambler.

46:08.842 --> 46:12.721
Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet
store. I'm helping him pick out a turtle.

46:12.922 --> 46:15.641
- Try and stay calm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:16.722 --> 46:18.519
- Hey. Jerry?
- Seth.

46:18.682 --> 46:20.752
Wow, what has it been,
like, five years?

46:20.922 --> 46:22.833
- At least.
- You want to grab lunch?

46:23.322 --> 46:25.074
I'm actually
headed back to the office.

46:25.242 --> 46:26.755
Seth, it's me.

46:26.922 --> 46:29.720
What's more important than catching
up with an old college buddy?

46:29.882 --> 46:32.271
Well, I am supposed
to be in this meeting.

46:32.442 --> 46:36.993
Blow it off. Remember Poli-Sci?
How many of those did we go to?

46:37.522 --> 46:40.434
- All right, I guess I can go.
- All right. All right.

46:40.602 --> 46:42.638
- Hey, whatever happened to Moochy?
- He's dead.

46:42.802 --> 46:44.235
Is that right?

46:44.762 --> 46:47.640
Still don't know how you can call lunch
with me a business expense.

46:47.802 --> 46:49.713
- What do you think of the catalogue?
- Stinks.

46:49.882 --> 46:51.395
There, we just talked business.

46:52.682 --> 46:54.991
We have the down comforter
and the cookware you liked.

46:55.162 --> 46:57.722
Great. Put it on the Peterman
account with the other stuff.

46:57.882 --> 46:59.474
You know what we have
you might like?

46:59.642 --> 47:01.360
I'll take it.

47:01.522 --> 47:03.797
Hey, you like?

47:05.402 --> 47:07.313
I think it looks very nice on you.

47:08.082 --> 47:09.720
Really?

47:11.282 --> 47:12.920
Elaine?

47:13.482 --> 47:15.632
- The Peterman account?
- Why not?

47:15.802 --> 47:18.362
And some hair
for my little friend here.

47:19.202 --> 47:20.794
So how's your stand-up career?

47:20.962 --> 47:23.601
Good. As a matter of fact,
I almost had my own show in Japan.

47:23.762 --> 47:25.514
- You speak Japanese?
- No.

47:25.682 --> 47:28.754
So you would have done it in
Japan, but in English?

47:30.562 --> 47:32.393
I don't know.

47:34.322 --> 47:35.641
So, what's this job of yours?

47:36.122 --> 47:39.797
Big investment firm.
We just got the Citibank account.

47:39.962 --> 47:42.954
In fact, today was our
first big meeting with them.

47:43.882 --> 47:45.679
The meeting you blew off?

47:45.842 --> 47:47.639
Yeah.

47:48.922 --> 47:51.038
Wasn't that kind of important?

47:52.602 --> 47:54.274
Yeah.

47:56.682 --> 47:59.958
And I bought a whole new set
of cookware and a water pick.

48:00.122 --> 48:02.556
- You use a water pick?
- Sure. Water pick...

48:02.722 --> 48:04.838
...floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.

48:05.002 --> 48:07.470
So you go into the bathroom 11,
you're in bed by what, 2?

48:07.642 --> 48:11.430
At the latest. Oh, hang on a second.
I've got another call.

48:12.522 --> 48:14.274
- Hello?
- Good day, Miss Benes...

48:14.442 --> 48:15.795
...it's Roger lpswich.

48:15.962 --> 48:17.998
Oh, hey, how are things
doing in accounting?

48:18.162 --> 48:21.234
Miss Benes, I notice you've been
charging quite a bit of merchandise...

48:21.402 --> 48:22.721
...on the Peterman account.

48:22.882 --> 48:25.077
Well, I am the president.

48:25.242 --> 48:28.951
Yes, and we're all very impressed.

48:29.122 --> 48:33.115
Nevertheless, the expense account
is for business purposes only.

48:33.722 --> 48:37.761
Well... Well, isn't the president
allowed to do anything that they want?

48:37.922 --> 48:39.435
No.

48:40.442 --> 48:44.594
I'll be in your office
first thing tomorrow. Good day.

48:44.762 --> 48:46.673
Good day.

48:52.322 --> 48:53.960
Hello?

48:55.522 --> 48:57.353
Anybody?

49:02.522 --> 49:03.796
Hey.

49:03.962 --> 49:07.637
Hey. Why didn't you
get the big one?

49:08.482 --> 49:11.121
This hat just bottles in the heat.
I don't even need a coat.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.601
It's unbelievable.

49:12.762 --> 49:15.640
- I don't believe it.
- And I got a date with the saleswoman.

49:15.962 --> 49:18.430
She got a little Marisa Tomei
thing going on.

49:18.602 --> 49:21.799
Too bad you've got a little
George Costanza thing going on.

49:21.962 --> 49:24.430
I'm going out with her tomorrow.
She had errands to run.

49:24.602 --> 49:26.035
That's a date?

49:26.202 --> 49:28.557
What's the difference?
You know the way I work.

49:28.722 --> 49:30.360
I'm like a commercial jingle.

49:30.522 --> 49:34.356
First, it's a little irritating. You hear it
a few times. You hum it in the shower.

49:34.522 --> 49:37.719
By the third date, it's "By Mennen."

49:38.682 --> 49:40.593
How you make sure
you get to the third date?

49:40.762 --> 49:43.640
If there's any doubt,
I do a leave-behind.

49:43.802 --> 49:47.272
Keys, gloves, scarf.
I go back to her place to pick it up...

49:47.442 --> 49:50.036
...date number two.
- That is so old.

49:50.202 --> 49:52.716
Why don't you just show up
at her house in a wooden horse?

49:56.082 --> 49:57.800
By Mennen

49:58.842 --> 50:00.434
What the...?

50:12.122 --> 50:13.396
What's going on in there?

50:13.562 --> 50:15.473
- What?
- That light.

50:15.642 --> 50:17.314
Oh, the red.

50:17.482 --> 50:21.395
Yeah, it's the chicken roaster sign.
It's right across from my window.

50:21.562 --> 50:22.915
Can't you shut the shades?

50:23.082 --> 50:25.073
They are shut.

50:25.242 --> 50:27.119
By the way, your friend Seth,
he stopped by.

50:27.282 --> 50:29.238
- Yeah? What'd he have to say?
- He was fired.

50:31.802 --> 50:34.191
As you can see, the comforter
I expensed is actually...

50:34.362 --> 50:37.513
...the Aristotle goose down tunic.

50:37.922 --> 50:40.800
- What do you think?
- Another bull's-eye.

50:40.962 --> 50:43.476
Well, Mr. Ipswich,
since every one of my expenses...

50:43.642 --> 50:48.272
...was obviously
for a legitimate business purpose...

50:48.442 --> 50:51.479
I just need to see the
sable hat you purchased yesterday.

50:51.642 --> 50:53.678
The hat? Why do you need to
see the hat?

50:53.842 --> 50:55.753
It cost $8000.

50:55.922 --> 50:57.401
What?

51:01.162 --> 51:04.552
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so
important, why did you go to lunch?

51:04.722 --> 51:06.041
We're old college buddies.

51:06.202 --> 51:08.193
I only knew you through Moochy.

51:08.882 --> 51:10.952
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it,
all right?

51:11.122 --> 51:14.319
The important thing is,
is we got a chance to catch up.

51:14.482 --> 51:16.996
Mind if I grab the want ads?

51:17.402 --> 51:20.075
Actually, I haven't read
Tank McNamara yet.

51:25.642 --> 51:27.951
How's life on the red planet?

51:29.082 --> 51:32.233
It's killing me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

51:32.402 --> 51:36.554
All I can see is that giant red sun
in the shape of a chicken.

51:37.082 --> 51:39.471
Well, did you go down to the
Kenny Rogers and complain?

51:39.642 --> 51:41.234
Oh, they gave me the heave-ho.

51:41.642 --> 51:45.555
I don't think that Kenny Rogers has
any idea what's going on down there.

51:45.722 --> 51:47.314
What are you doing?

51:49.002 --> 51:51.470
- Getting some cereal.
- That's tomato juice.

51:56.122 --> 51:57.874
That looked like milk to me.

52:00.002 --> 52:03.119
Jerry, my rods
and cones are all screwed up.

52:03.562 --> 52:05.154
All right, that's it.

52:05.322 --> 52:07.552
I gotta move in with you, Jerry.

52:09.882 --> 52:11.793
I don't know, Kramer.

52:12.162 --> 52:14.835
My concern is that...

52:15.002 --> 52:17.960
...living together after a while we...

52:19.042 --> 52:22.512
...might start to get on
each other's nerves a little.

52:23.322 --> 52:25.597
Listen, I got an idea.
You're a heavy sleeper, right?

52:25.762 --> 52:27.115
Why don't we switch apartments?

52:27.282 --> 52:29.398
Or I could sleep in the park.

52:30.362 --> 52:34.196
You can knock these walls down,
make it an eight-room luxury suite.

52:34.362 --> 52:38.833
Jerry, these are load bearing walls.
They're not gonna come down.

52:39.442 --> 52:41.160
Yeah, that's no good.

52:41.322 --> 52:43.472
I may have to drive that place
out of business.

52:43.642 --> 52:46.634
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- Like we did in the '60s.

52:46.802 --> 52:48.793
Taking it to the streets.

52:54.202 --> 52:58.115
- Thanks, George, but I got it from here.
- Oh, no, I'm in already. Come on.

52:59.962 --> 53:02.999
So you wanna
get together tomorrow?

53:03.162 --> 53:05.073
No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.

53:05.602 --> 53:09.481
- What about this weekend?
- I'm gonna be busy for a while.

53:09.802 --> 53:12.362
Okay. See you.

53:12.522 --> 53:15.082
Hey, you forgot your keys.

53:15.242 --> 53:17.881
- Those aren't my keys.
- Well, they're not mine.

53:21.722 --> 53:25.032
They are my keys. How weird.

53:25.802 --> 53:28.111
- Goodbye, George.
- Yeah, bye.

53:29.122 --> 53:30.635
George, bye.

53:32.802 --> 53:37.432
Hello? You are not gonna
believe the date I just had.

53:38.802 --> 53:41.236
Costanza

53:43.282 --> 53:45.079
What do you mean,
you don't have the hat?

53:45.242 --> 53:46.994
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?

53:47.162 --> 53:49.153
No, dead.

53:49.682 --> 53:51.877
George, I need
that Russian hat back.

53:52.042 --> 53:53.953
All right, all right. I'll call Heather.

53:54.122 --> 53:57.319
You'll get your hat back.
I will get a second date.

53:57.482 --> 54:00.121
Now, watch the magic.

54:02.002 --> 54:03.958
Dial nine, Merlin.

54:08.562 --> 54:12.237
- Hello?
- Heather, hi, it's George Costanza.

54:13.722 --> 54:16.441
Listen, I don't mean
to bother you, but silly me...

54:16.602 --> 54:19.958
...l... I think I may have left my hat
in your apartment, so I thought...

54:20.122 --> 54:23.432
...l'd just come by later and pick it up.
- You didn't leave a hat here.

54:23.602 --> 54:28.517
I'm pretty sure I left it behind the
cushion of the chair, accidentally.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.718
No hat. George, I've gotta go.

54:30.882 --> 54:34.477
You know what,
maybe I'll just come... Hey, hey.

54:40.122 --> 54:43.956
- Seth?
- Jerry, hi. What do you think?

54:44.122 --> 54:46.761
I think you're taking the trash
out for this chicken place...

54:46.922 --> 54:50.278
...but that couldn't be.
- Yeah, I'm the new manager.

54:50.442 --> 54:53.081
But you were an executive.
This is fast food.

54:53.242 --> 54:55.631
Not fast food. Good food quickly.

54:55.802 --> 54:58.111
Hey, next time lunch
will be on me, huh, Jer?

54:58.282 --> 54:59.635
Hey!

55:00.002 --> 55:02.800
Stay away from the chicken!
It's bad!

55:02.962 --> 55:05.476
Bad chicken! Mess you up!

55:05.642 --> 55:08.202
That's not going to be
good for business.

55:08.362 --> 55:10.751
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

55:16.362 --> 55:19.115
I'm so glad we switched apartments.
It was the perfect solution.

55:19.282 --> 55:23.321
Kramer, if I'm gonna live over there,
you gotta take some of this stuff out.

55:23.482 --> 55:25.996
I mean, this thing
is really freaking me out.

55:26.162 --> 55:29.552
I feel like it's gonna come to life
in the middle of the night and kill me.

55:29.842 --> 55:32.276
What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.

55:32.442 --> 55:36.720
And one other thing, I don't want
Newman using my...

55:36.882 --> 55:38.440
Oh, no.

55:38.882 --> 55:40.600
- Nice place you got here, Kramer.
- Yeah.

55:40.762 --> 55:43.959
A man could really
get some thinking done.

55:46.042 --> 55:48.681
Don't get too comfortable.
As soon as Seth gets a real job...

55:48.842 --> 55:51.800
...you two are going back in that
chicken supernova.

55:53.082 --> 55:55.960
What's that, Rogers chicken?
Oh, get that out of here.

55:56.122 --> 55:59.000
I don't know. The man makes
a pretty strong bird.

55:59.162 --> 56:01.073
Yeah, but I'm boycotting.

56:14.842 --> 56:16.434
- What is that, hickory?
- Yeah.

56:16.842 --> 56:18.992
It's the wood that makes it good.

56:19.802 --> 56:21.235
Really?

56:22.002 --> 56:25.233
Stop it. What's the matter with you?

56:31.322 --> 56:33.472
- Can I help you?
- Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes.

56:33.642 --> 56:38.079
We met at Barney's.
I'm a friend of George Costanza's.

56:38.282 --> 56:39.761
Hi.

56:39.922 --> 56:43.961
Whether you're aware of it or not,
George had this pathetic little plan...

56:44.122 --> 56:48.274
...to leave something behind so he
could try and weasel a second date.

56:48.442 --> 56:50.034
- Really?
- I know.

56:50.202 --> 56:52.238
He... He has a real
confidence problem.

56:52.402 --> 56:54.552
- Well, not really...
- George.

56:56.682 --> 56:58.912
I know you told him
that you didn't have the hat...

56:59.082 --> 57:02.791
...because you didn't want to see
him again, and more sympathetic...

57:02.962 --> 57:04.714
...I could not be...

57:05.842 --> 57:08.754
...but I really do need
to have the hat back.

57:08.922 --> 57:11.561
Look. I don't know what to tell you,
but there's no hat here.

57:11.722 --> 57:14.361
I mean, maybe the maid took it.
I had people over but...

57:14.522 --> 57:15.671
Well, that makes sense.

57:15.842 --> 57:18.800
Well, then you wouldn't mind
if we took a second look around?

57:19.242 --> 57:20.721
Be my guest.

57:20.882 --> 57:22.554
Good to see you again.

57:27.402 --> 57:30.633
She's bluffing. She's got it
stashed away in there somewhere.

57:30.802 --> 57:33.600
This is an absolute disaster.

57:33.762 --> 57:36.515
Oh, I don't know. Check this out.

57:42.042 --> 57:44.317
You stole her clock?

57:47.962 --> 57:49.680
Well done.

57:50.042 --> 57:53.398
Yep. This is one for our side.

58:11.042 --> 58:12.919
What is that creaking?

58:13.082 --> 58:15.801
It's lik e I'm in the hold of a ship.

58:15.962 --> 58:17.918
I've gotta relax.

58:23.442 --> 58:25.000
Hello?

58:25.842 --> 58:28.356
Is somebody there?

58:28.522 --> 58:30.672
Mr. Marbles?

58:33.642 --> 58:36.714
So I told lpswich I'd have
the hat by this afternoon.

58:36.882 --> 58:40.272
- What am I going to do?
- You should sleep with him.

58:46.042 --> 58:47.634
Hi, buddy.

58:48.682 --> 58:51.150
I'm on no sleep, no sleep.

58:51.322 --> 58:54.280
You don't know what it's like.
Things are creaking and cracking...

58:54.442 --> 58:57.036
...and that red light
is burning my brain.

58:57.722 --> 59:00.919
- You look a little stressed.
- Oh, I'm stressed.

59:04.442 --> 59:07.912
So, Kramer, what am I supposed to do?
If I don't have that fur hat by 4:00...

59:08.082 --> 59:10.277
...they're gonna take me down
like Nixon.

59:10.442 --> 59:12.910
You know my friend
Bob Sacamano?

59:13.082 --> 59:14.515
I thought he was Kramer's friend.

59:14.682 --> 59:17.242
He called last night about
3 a.m. and we got to talking.

59:17.402 --> 59:21.031
He sells Russian hats
down at Battery Park, 40 bucks.

59:21.722 --> 59:23.872
Forty bucks? Are they sable?

59:24.042 --> 59:26.192
No, but the difference is negligible.

59:27.322 --> 59:29.756
Oh, yeah, I like this idea.

59:30.522 --> 59:33.594
- All right. Let's give it a shot. Let's go.
- Giddyup.

59:36.442 --> 59:39.434
- It's getting cold. It's getting cold.
- That was a close one.

59:39.642 --> 59:41.041
Why do we keep this from Jerry?

59:41.242 --> 59:45.713
If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Rogers
chicken, I'm back with the red menace.

59:47.962 --> 59:50.760
Miss Benes, the hat you charged
to the company was sable.

59:51.322 --> 59:53.552
This is nutria.

59:54.722 --> 59:59.238
Well, that's a... It's a kind of sable.

59:59.522 --> 01:00:02.753
No, it's a kind of rat.

01:00:03.962 --> 01:00:05.918
That's a rat hat?

01:00:06.162 --> 01:00:09.677
And a poorly made one,
even by rat hat standards.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:13.317
I've no choice but to
recommended your termination...

01:00:13.482 --> 01:00:16.155
...to the board of directors.
Nothing short of the approval...

01:00:16.322 --> 01:00:18.597
...of Peterman himself
will save you this time.

01:00:18.762 --> 01:00:21.196
But... But he's in the Burmese jungle.

01:00:21.562 --> 01:00:23.473
And quite mad, too, from what I hear.

01:00:24.122 --> 01:00:27.319
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Can I fire you?

01:00:27.962 --> 01:00:29.759
No.

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:33.873
- So Heather called?
- Yeah, but get this.

01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:37.751
The message said,
"Call me if you have the time."

01:00:37.922 --> 01:00:40.595
If I have the time? You got it?

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:43.640
No, but this is all very exciting.

01:00:44.122 --> 01:00:46.033
She knows that I have her clock.

01:00:46.202 --> 01:00:48.033
I know that she has my hat.

01:00:48.202 --> 01:00:50.352
I think she's getting ready
to make an exchange.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:54.197
Well, there is the possibility that
you've gone right out of your mind.

01:00:55.802 --> 01:00:58.362
I've looked at that. It seems unlikely.

01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:00.319
Well, I'd look again.

01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:02.837
So how come you didn't call
Jerry about all this?

01:01:03.002 --> 01:01:05.232
Jerry. I can't talk to Jerry anymore.

01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:08.439
Ever since he moved into
that apartment he's too much...

01:01:08.602 --> 01:01:10.354
...like you.

01:01:10.522 --> 01:01:12.353
That's a shame.

01:01:14.682 --> 01:01:17.355
Seth, you're the manager.
Can't you turn off that sign?

01:01:17.522 --> 01:01:20.992
Jerry, I lied.
I'm just an assistant manager.

01:01:21.962 --> 01:01:25.318
Number 67, family feast.

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.474
Number 67. Right here. Right here.

01:01:28.642 --> 01:01:31.315
- Hello, Newman.
- Hello, Jerry.

01:01:31.482 --> 01:01:33.473
And don't forget
your steamed broccoli.

01:01:33.642 --> 01:01:34.916
Hold it.

01:01:35.482 --> 01:01:38.042
Broccoli? Newman,
you wouldn't eat broccoli...

01:01:38.202 --> 01:01:40.921
...if it was deep fried
in chocolate sauce.

01:01:42.362 --> 01:01:46.913
I love broccoli. It's good for you.

01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:48.674
Really?

01:01:49.082 --> 01:01:51.721
Then maybe
you'd like to have a piece.

01:01:52.322 --> 01:01:54.153
Gladly.

01:01:59.722 --> 01:02:01.713
Vile weed!

01:02:02.442 --> 01:02:04.034
It's for Kramer, isn't it? I knew it.

01:02:04.202 --> 01:02:06.272
The greasy doorknob.
The licking of the fingers.

01:02:06.442 --> 01:02:09.479
- He's hooked on the chicken, isn't he?
- Yes! Yes, now, please...

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.394
...someone, honey mustard.

01:02:24.162 --> 01:02:27.632
Newman, what took you...
Hey, buddy.

01:02:27.802 --> 01:02:29.360
- That was good.
- Expecting Newman?

01:02:29.522 --> 01:02:31.433
That's funny, because
I happened upon him...

01:02:31.602 --> 01:02:33.274
...down at the
Kenny Rogers Roasters.

01:02:33.442 --> 01:02:36.275
Kenny Rogers.
Oh, boy, I hate that place.

01:02:36.442 --> 01:02:39.400
He was buying quite a load of chicken,
almost enough for two people.

01:02:39.562 --> 01:02:41.837
- As long as one of them is not him.
- Yeah.

01:02:42.002 --> 01:02:44.596
Oh, hey, you know,
Elaine, she stopped by.

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:47.196
Yeah, dropped off
that Bob Sacamano hat.

01:02:47.362 --> 01:02:50.195
Yeah, oh, she's upset with him.
Yes, sirree.

01:02:50.362 --> 01:02:52.512
Yeah, well, thanks for stopping by.

01:02:52.922 --> 01:02:55.356
I sure do miss my apartment.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.478
Maybe I'll switch back.

01:02:57.642 --> 01:02:59.360
You don't want to think about that.

01:02:59.522 --> 01:03:02.275
Otherwise, I'd have no choice
but to put that banner back up...

01:03:02.442 --> 01:03:05.559
...and run that Rogers
right out of town.

01:03:05.722 --> 01:03:09.840
I don't think you will. Matter of fact I'll
save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.

01:03:10.002 --> 01:03:12.152
Go ahead. Put the banner up.
Doesn't matter to me.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.040
- All right.
- No, Jerry.

01:03:14.202 --> 01:03:16.272
I need that chicken!
I've got to have that ch...

01:03:16.442 --> 01:03:20.071
Now, you leave those roasters alone!
Kenny never hurt anybody!

01:03:21.002 --> 01:03:23.800
- You got a little problem.
- Oh, I got a big problem, Jerry!

01:03:35.842 --> 01:03:37.719
Here. Kneel here.

01:03:37.882 --> 01:03:39.031
- What?
- Kneel.

01:03:39.202 --> 01:03:41.193
Kneel? Okay.

01:03:43.802 --> 01:03:45.394
Elaine.

01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:50.441
Mr. Peterman.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:03:59.555
You speak Burmese?

01:03:59.722 --> 01:04:02.316
No, Elaine, that was gibberish.

01:04:04.602 --> 01:04:07.435
So did you have any
trouble finding the place?

01:04:07.602 --> 01:04:09.593
No, you're the only...

01:04:10.202 --> 01:04:13.717
...white-poet-warlord
in the neighbourhood.

01:04:15.442 --> 01:04:17.034
Are you an assassin?

01:04:17.202 --> 01:04:19.955
I work for your mail order catalogue.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:25.150
You're an errand girl sent
by grocery clerks to collect a bill.

01:04:25.322 --> 01:04:29.395
Well, actually, I do have a bill here.

01:04:29.562 --> 01:04:33.396
If you could just sign this
expense form...

01:04:33.562 --> 01:04:36.201
...I think I could still make
the last fan boat out of here.

01:04:36.922 --> 01:04:38.992
I'd be happy to, Elaine.

01:04:39.162 --> 01:04:40.675
Here you go.

01:04:41.762 --> 01:04:44.230
But I will have to see this hat.

01:04:46.202 --> 01:04:47.715
Right.

01:04:55.882 --> 01:04:57.201
So how do you want to do this?

01:04:57.362 --> 01:05:00.320
All right, George, I'll be honest.

01:05:00.482 --> 01:05:03.121
The first time we went out,
I found you very irritating.

01:05:03.282 --> 01:05:05.318
But after seeing you
a couple of times...

01:05:05.722 --> 01:05:08.441
...you sort of got stuck in my head.

01:05:08.602 --> 01:05:10.320
Costanza

01:05:11.802 --> 01:05:13.872
So you really don't have my hat?

01:05:14.042 --> 01:05:15.794
What?

01:05:19.802 --> 01:05:21.076
Let's go do something.

01:05:21.242 --> 01:05:25.030
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, that's... That's a sandwich.

01:05:28.282 --> 01:05:29.510
Damn salami.

01:05:31.522 --> 01:05:33.353
My clock.

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:36.317
- You stole it?
- That damn delicatessen.

01:05:36.482 --> 01:05:39.633
That is the last time they
screw up one of my orders.

01:05:45.402 --> 01:05:48.838
Hey, Seth. Man, it is coming
down hard out there.

01:05:51.682 --> 01:05:53.400
Oh, gross.

01:05:55.002 --> 01:05:56.879
That's not gonna be
good for business.

01:05:57.042 --> 01:05:59.476
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

01:06:08.682 --> 01:06:10.195
Kenny?

01:06:13.122 --> 01:06:14.760
Kenny?

01:06:24.562 --> 01:06:25.836
Kenny.

01:06:26.242 --> 01:06:27.800
Kenny.

01:06:31.162 --> 01:06:32.720
Kenny.

01:06:33.242 --> 01:06:34.834
Home at last.

01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:42.281
Is someone there?

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:47.279
Mr. Marbles.

01:06:48.122 --> 01:06:50.078
This is the urban sombrero.

01:06:50.242 --> 01:06:52.551
I put it on the last catalogue cover.

01:06:58.322 --> 01:07:00.278
The horror.

01:07:01.362 --> 01:07:03.318
The horror.

01:07:20.432 --> 01:07:23.390
Say me, you and Kramer
are flying over the Andes.

01:07:23.552 --> 01:07:25.065
Why are we flying over the Andes?

01:07:25.232 --> 01:07:28.304
We got a soccer game in Chile.
Anyway, the plane crashes.

01:07:28.472 --> 01:07:31.464
- Who are you gonna eat to survive?
- Kramer.

01:07:32.192 --> 01:07:35.184
- So fast? What about me?
- No.

01:07:36.112 --> 01:07:39.422
Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.

01:07:39.592 --> 01:07:43.790
Kramer's got more muscle, higher
protein content. It's better for you.

01:07:43.952 --> 01:07:47.865
- Well, I would eat you.
- That's very nice, I guess.

01:07:48.032 --> 01:07:50.182
Why wouldn't you eat me?
I'm your best friend.

01:07:50.352 --> 01:07:52.502
If other people are having some,
I'll try you.

01:07:52.672 --> 01:07:54.185
Thank you.

01:07:54.792 --> 01:07:56.987
- Can I have a piece of that?
- No.

01:08:03.352 --> 01:08:05.991
George, I can't have sex.

01:08:09.872 --> 01:08:12.306
With me, or in general?

01:08:13.072 --> 01:08:15.711
I went to the doctor today.
I have mono.

01:08:15.872 --> 01:08:17.624
Nucleosis?

01:08:17.792 --> 01:08:21.182
- I hope that's not a problem for you.
- No, no.

01:08:22.511 --> 01:08:26.187
So how long is this not gonna be
a problem for me?

01:08:28.392 --> 01:08:31.225
- Six weeks?
- Yeah, six weeks.

01:08:31.392 --> 01:08:33.348
So what?
You've gone six weeks before.

01:08:33.511 --> 01:08:35.707
I can do six weeks
standing on my head.

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:39.629
I'm like a sexual camel.
That's not the point.

01:08:39.792 --> 01:08:41.828
At least there was the possibility.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:43.983
- You gonna break up with her?
- I don't know.

01:08:44.152 --> 01:08:46.346
- I don't wanna be one of those guys.
- What guys?

01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:48.423
Like us.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.390
- So it's just mono.
- Mono?

01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:53.542
Well, if anybody needs
any medical advice...

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:57.625
...Laney met a doctor,
and he's unattached.

01:08:57.792 --> 01:09:00.430
I thought the whole dream
of dating a doctor was debunked?

01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:03.948
No, it's not debunk. It's totally bunk.

01:09:04.112 --> 01:09:06.501
Isn't bunk bad?
Like, "that's a lot of bunk"?

01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:08.627
No, something is bunk,
then you debunk it.

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:11.067
- What?
- I think.

01:09:14.432 --> 01:09:19.187
Lookit. I'm dating a doctor, and I like it.
Let's just move on.

01:09:21.392 --> 01:09:22.825
- Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
- Jerry.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.586
Something came up for Tuesday
at the Dayton Civic Centre.

01:09:25.752 --> 01:09:28.983
- That's Ohio, Jerry.
- I've heard of Ohio, Katie...

01:09:29.152 --> 01:09:32.144
...but Tuesday's no good.
I'm doing Career Day at my junior high.

01:09:32.352 --> 01:09:33.626
Okay, Jerry, that's fine.

01:09:33.792 --> 01:09:35.384
- All right.
- Katie works for Jerry.

01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:38.624
- Yes, all right, Katie. Thank you. Yes.
- Sorry for the late notice.

01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:40.510
- Bye. Bye.
- Okay, you're the...

01:09:43.471 --> 01:09:46.350
- They asked you to do Career Day?
- Yeah, it's no big thing.

01:09:46.511 --> 01:09:48.184
With due respect, I went there...

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:50.421
...and I work for
a World Series-winning team.

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:52.389
And you were integral.

01:09:59.072 --> 01:10:02.701
Jerry, so nice of you
to come down here.

01:10:02.872 --> 01:10:04.021
I'm on next, right?

01:10:04.192 --> 01:10:08.231
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Amiry,
from the Bronx Zoo...

01:10:08.392 --> 01:10:11.464
- The guy with the lizard?
- Yes.

01:10:11.632 --> 01:10:16.387
Well, he started feeding it crickets,
and the children just love him...

01:10:16.552 --> 01:10:18.110
...and we're out of time.

01:10:20.312 --> 01:10:22.746
So can you come back tomorrow?

01:10:23.312 --> 01:10:27.828
I'm getting bumped?
You're bumping me from Career Day?

01:10:29.632 --> 01:10:33.261
So do most doctors like ER,
or do you guys just think it's fake?

01:10:33.432 --> 01:10:36.344
I couldn't tell you.
You know, I'm not really a doctor.

01:10:36.512 --> 01:10:38.230
Then I'm not really attracted you.

01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:43.663
I'm serious, Elaine.
I went to med school...

01:10:43.832 --> 01:10:46.665
...but I still have to pass
my licensing exam.

01:10:47.272 --> 01:10:48.705
When do you take this exam?

01:10:48.872 --> 01:10:53.070
I've taken it three times.
I almost passed the last one.

01:10:53.232 --> 01:10:56.986
But you're basically a doctor.
I mean, people do call you doctor?

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.791
- Well...
- Can I introduce you as doctor?

01:10:59.952 --> 01:11:02.625
- Yeah.
- All right. That's all I wanted to know.

01:11:04.712 --> 01:11:06.111
Mono.

01:11:09.032 --> 01:11:10.021
It was fantastic.

01:11:10.192 --> 01:11:13.343
- We wound up talking all night.
- You're enjoying the not enjoying.

01:11:13.512 --> 01:11:17.744
You know, just by conversing, you can
really learn a lot about a person.

01:11:17.912 --> 01:11:19.425
I'm finding that out.

01:11:20.072 --> 01:11:21.266
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

01:11:21.432 --> 01:11:22.626
How was Career Day?

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:26.148
I didn't get on.
The lizard guy went long.

01:11:26.832 --> 01:11:31.428
- You got bumped from Career Day?
- It was a mix-up, I'm sure.

01:11:32.112 --> 01:11:34.990
Sounds like they're trying to
screw with your head.

01:11:35.152 --> 01:11:38.861
Now, why would a junior high school
wanna screw with my head?

01:11:39.032 --> 01:11:41.307
Why does Radio Shack
ask for your phone number...

01:11:41.472 --> 01:11:43.622
...when you buy batteries?

01:11:45.112 --> 01:11:46.864
I don't know.

01:11:49.312 --> 01:11:51.428
Hey, hey.
Kramer, what are you doing?

01:11:51.592 --> 01:11:54.106
- You can't smoke in here.
- Oh, go on.

01:11:54.272 --> 01:11:59.027
- Hey, take it outside.
- Come on, Larry. You know me.

01:11:59.192 --> 01:12:01.752
It bothers people,
and it's against the law.

01:12:01.912 --> 01:12:05.188
You can make all the laws you want.
He's still gonna bother people.

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:17.990
- What, did they kick you out too?
- Yeah, they kicked us all out.

01:12:21.312 --> 01:12:23.382
Thanks for coming back.
Graham cracker?

01:12:23.552 --> 01:12:25.224
No, let's just do it.

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:28.147
What? What is going on?
What is that about?

01:12:28.312 --> 01:12:32.021
Fire drill. Sorry.
Single file, everyone.

01:12:32.192 --> 01:12:35.662
- But I was promised a slot.
- Single file, Jerry.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:44.305
Fire drill. You believe that?

01:12:44.472 --> 01:12:47.225
- Who is Pericles?
- Pericles is correct.

01:12:47.392 --> 01:12:49.428
Like fire in a school
is such a big deal.

01:12:50.832 --> 01:12:52.823
- You got any matches?
- Middle drawer.

01:12:52.992 --> 01:12:54.823
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

01:12:54.992 --> 01:12:56.903
We were looking for
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:58.346
Thanks.

01:12:59.632 --> 01:13:01.350
- Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
- Jerry.

01:13:01.512 --> 01:13:04.106
I heard what happened at the school.
They can't bump you.

01:13:04.272 --> 01:13:07.867
- That is so unprofessional.
- Oh, relax, Katie. It's not a problem.

01:13:08.032 --> 01:13:10.023
- What is Borax?
- Yes, you are right.

01:13:10.192 --> 01:13:11.625
They bump you in junior high...

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:15.023
...next, you're being bumped in
high schools, colleges, trade schools.

01:13:15.192 --> 01:13:17.786
Before you know it,
Letterman won't return your calls.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.547
- You got an ashtray?
- I don't have any ashtrays.

01:13:20.712 --> 01:13:22.668
Cereal bowls.

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:24.948
Jerry, don't freak out.
I'll tak e care of you.

01:13:25.112 --> 01:13:27.342
- Katie, don't...
- All right. Thanks.

01:13:28.312 --> 01:13:30.780
What is tungsten or wolfram?

01:13:30.952 --> 01:13:33.512
We were looking for:
What is tungsten or wolfram?

01:13:38.472 --> 01:13:40.428
Is this a repeat?

01:13:40.592 --> 01:13:43.231
No, no, no. Just lately
I've been thinking a lot clearer.

01:13:43.392 --> 01:13:45.303
Like this afternoon...
What is chicken Kiev?

01:13:45.472 --> 01:13:49.545
- I really enjoyed watching
a documentary with Louise.

01:13:49.712 --> 01:13:51.942
Louise. That's what's doing it.

01:13:52.912 --> 01:13:56.427
You're no longer preoccupied with sex,
so your mind is able to focus.

01:13:59.032 --> 01:14:01.990
- You think?
- Yeah. Let's say this is your brain.

01:14:02.152 --> 01:14:04.620
Okay?
Now, from what I know about you...

01:14:04.792 --> 01:14:07.181
...your brain consists of two parts.

01:14:07.352 --> 01:14:09.912
The intellect, represented here...

01:14:11.672 --> 01:14:14.106
...and the part obsessed with sex.

01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:16.701
Now, granted...

01:14:16.872 --> 01:14:21.184
...you have extracted an astonishing
amount from this little scrap.

01:14:21.352 --> 01:14:25.425
But with no-sex Louise,
this previously useless lump...

01:14:25.592 --> 01:14:29.380
...is now functioning
for the first time in its existence.

01:14:32.112 --> 01:14:33.704
Oh, my God.

01:14:33.872 --> 01:14:37.023
I just remembered where I left
my retainer in second grade.

01:14:37.192 --> 01:14:38.784
I'll see you later.

01:14:41.312 --> 01:14:45.021
- Hey, I need some more matches.
- What is going on in there?

01:14:45.192 --> 01:14:47.183
I met some people smoking
on the street...

01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:49.627
...so I invited them
up to my apartment to smoke.

01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:52.511
- Why?
- Somebody had to.

01:14:52.672 --> 01:14:55.982
Just because a person's a smoker
doesn't mean he's not a human being.

01:14:56.152 --> 01:14:57.551
It doesn't?

01:14:57.712 --> 01:15:00.146
These people aren't gonna
let themselves be flicked...

01:15:00.312 --> 01:15:01.791
...into the ashbin of society.

01:15:01.952 --> 01:15:04.182
- Why not?
- Well, you can confine them.

01:15:04.352 --> 01:15:06.946
You can punish them.
You can cram them into the corner...

01:15:07.112 --> 01:15:08.830
...but they're not going away, Jerry.

01:15:10.032 --> 01:15:13.911
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:15:15.392 --> 01:15:17.030
When they hand out
those cadavers...

01:15:17.192 --> 01:15:19.069
...do you choose if it's a man
or woman?

01:15:19.232 --> 01:15:22.110
I don't know.
Dead bodies really gross me out.

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.029
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

01:15:26.192 --> 01:15:30.265
Oh, it's Sue Ellen Mischke,
this old braless friend I hate.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:34.228
- Elaine? Hi.
- Oh, hi, Sue Ellen, hi.

01:15:34.432 --> 01:15:38.903
Oh, Rick, this is an old,
old friend of mine. Elaine Benes.

01:15:39.072 --> 01:15:42.348
Rick is a periodontist.
He does Giuliani's gums.

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:45.940
Well, this is my boyfriend,
Dr. Ben Galvant.

01:15:46.112 --> 01:15:49.582
- Oh, well, I'm an intern.
- Hey, stop kidding, Ben.

01:15:51.512 --> 01:15:54.868
He's a doctor.
He's a very good doctor.

01:15:55.032 --> 01:15:57.990
Carlito's just passed out.
Can anyone help?

01:15:58.152 --> 01:16:01.940
- Oh, there's a doctor right here.
- No, there's not.

01:16:02.112 --> 01:16:04.148
Can't you at least tell them
what to do?

01:16:04.312 --> 01:16:06.746
- Like what?
- Shouldn't he elevate his legs?

01:16:07.112 --> 01:16:09.580
Right. Elevate your legs.

01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:18.465
I hope Carlito feels better.

01:16:18.632 --> 01:16:22.181
- Ben really wishes he could've helped.
- I thought he was a doctor.

01:16:22.352 --> 01:16:23.944
Oh, he is.

01:16:24.232 --> 01:16:26.063
You know, kind of.

01:16:26.632 --> 01:16:29.783
I mean, I call him doctor.

01:16:34.232 --> 01:16:35.745
George.

01:16:37.832 --> 01:16:41.222
Of course, absolute zero.

01:16:44.752 --> 01:16:48.301
- What? What is with all these books?
- I stopped having sex.

01:16:51.512 --> 01:16:54.026
All right. I'll see you, Phil.
I've got room for two...

01:16:54.192 --> 01:16:57.309
...but the only thing I have
is in the non-filter section.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:58.706
Hey, hey, how you doing?

01:16:58.872 --> 01:17:00.863
What, you got
a smokers' lounge in there?

01:17:01.032 --> 01:17:03.546
Oh, yeah, people really seem
to be enjoying themselves.

01:17:03.712 --> 01:17:06.624
You know, they come in once,
it's like they're addicted.

01:17:07.712 --> 01:17:11.751
Jerry. Oh, there you are.
You didn't answer your phone.

01:17:11.912 --> 01:17:13.982
I was out.

01:17:14.152 --> 01:17:16.222
Jerry, great news.

01:17:16.392 --> 01:17:21.022
- I got you an assembly.
- An assembly?

01:17:21.592 --> 01:17:25.141
Two hours in front of the entire
junior high, grades six through eight.

01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:27.746
- That's sixth grade, seventh grade...
- I understand.

01:17:27.912 --> 01:17:30.380
But what am I gonna talk about
for two hours?

01:17:30.552 --> 01:17:34.431
And it is already in the school paper.
They cancelled Rick James.

01:17:34.832 --> 01:17:38.222
- "Super Freak"?
- Yes.

01:17:38.392 --> 01:17:41.111
What is your answer to number 74?

01:17:41.272 --> 01:17:44.821
- Metabolic acidosis.
- No.

01:17:44.992 --> 01:17:47.631
Hypokalemia.

01:17:47.952 --> 01:17:49.988
Not metabolic acidosis.

01:17:52.352 --> 01:17:54.820
Oh, man,
I'm never gonna pass this thing.

01:17:54.992 --> 01:17:58.780
Oh, yes, you are.
We'll just stop having sex.

01:18:00.392 --> 01:18:04.783
You guys. Hitting is not about muscle.
It's simple physics.

01:18:04.952 --> 01:18:07.989
Calculate the velocity, V,
in relation to the trajectory, T...

01:18:08.152 --> 01:18:11.189
...in which, G, gravity, of course,
remains a constant.

01:18:15.832 --> 01:18:18.221
- It's not complicated.
- Now, who are you again?

01:18:18.392 --> 01:18:22.226
George Costanza,
assistant to the travelling secretary.

01:18:23.352 --> 01:18:26.503
Are you the guy who put us
in that Ramada in Milwaukee?

01:18:26.672 --> 01:18:29.505
You wanna talk about hotels,
or you wanna win some ball games?

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:31.105
Hey, we won the World Series.

01:18:31.952 --> 01:18:33.829
In six games.

01:18:40.112 --> 01:18:43.229
So if you like to tell jokes,
and you love to make people laugh...

01:18:43.392 --> 01:18:46.782
...stand-up comedy may be
the career for you.

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:52.150
Thank you.

01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:57.703
Nine minutes.

01:18:58.912 --> 01:19:00.425
How am I gonna fill two hours?

01:19:00.592 --> 01:19:03.390
Hello? I could take an hour
off your hands.

01:19:03.552 --> 01:19:05.429
Let the kids see a real, live Yankee.

01:19:05.592 --> 01:19:08.504
And give you the chance to see
some real disappointed kids.

01:19:11.072 --> 01:19:12.505
Yes, I take your order, please?

01:19:12.672 --> 01:19:15.903
Excuse me, darling, do l...?
Do I detect a Portuguese accent?

01:19:24.272 --> 01:19:25.864
No, don't mention it.

01:19:27.072 --> 01:19:30.587
- Portuguese?
- Yeah, my cleaning lady is Portuguese.

01:19:30.752 --> 01:19:32.663
I must have picked it up.

01:19:32.832 --> 01:19:34.823
How come he's getting so smart?

01:19:34.992 --> 01:19:37.142
I stopped having sex with Ben
three days ago...

01:19:37.312 --> 01:19:39.621
...and I don't know no Portuguese.

01:19:42.352 --> 01:19:45.310
- Are you all right?
- I don't know. I just...

01:19:45.472 --> 01:19:49.351
The last couple of days my mind
has been kind of, you know...

01:19:54.672 --> 01:19:56.628
...not good.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.623
Wait a second.
I know what's happening.

01:19:58.792 --> 01:20:01.545
The no-sex thing is having
the reverse affect on you.

01:20:01.712 --> 01:20:03.828
What? What are you talking about?

01:20:03.992 --> 01:20:05.903
To a woman,
sex is like the garbage man.

01:20:06.072 --> 01:20:09.109
You take for granted that when
you put some trash on the street...

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:12.105
...a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna
come along and pick it up.

01:20:13.312 --> 01:20:16.748
But now, no sex,
it's like a garbage strike.

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:20.746
The bags are piling up in your head.
The sidewalk is blocked.

01:20:20.912 --> 01:20:23.631
Nothing's getting through.
You're stupid.

01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:26.511
- I don't understand.
- Exactly.

01:20:32.752 --> 01:20:34.151
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

01:20:34.312 --> 01:20:37.224
Hey, you should come over.
Tonight's pipe night.

01:20:38.752 --> 01:20:41.312
- What happened to your face?
- What?

01:20:41.472 --> 01:20:44.225
It looks like an old catcher's mitt.

01:20:45.032 --> 01:20:46.431
What?

01:20:50.472 --> 01:20:55.830
Look at that.
My face is all craggily. It's crinkly.

01:20:55.992 --> 01:20:57.789
It's from all that smoke.

01:20:57.952 --> 01:21:00.750
You've experienced a lifetime
of smoking in 72 hours.

01:21:00.912 --> 01:21:02.186
What did you expect?

01:21:02.672 --> 01:21:06.267
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer,
but not this.

01:21:07.592 --> 01:21:10.186
Jerry, you know,
my face is my livelihood.

01:21:12.992 --> 01:21:15.347
Everything I have I owe to this face.

01:21:15.512 --> 01:21:19.061
It's my allure, my twinkle, you know.

01:21:19.672 --> 01:21:22.266
You know, and your teeth,
your teeth are all brown.

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:27.072
Look away, I'm... I'm hideous.

01:21:34.992 --> 01:21:38.985
Hey, Ben, I need a four-letter word.

01:21:39.152 --> 01:21:42.303
"Winnie-the-" blank.

01:21:42.472 --> 01:21:45.987
- Pooh.
- Poo.

01:21:49.272 --> 01:21:51.661
No, it's Winnie-the-Pooh.

01:21:56.832 --> 01:21:58.265
So the hospital called.

01:21:58.432 --> 01:22:01.390
Turns out some stupid intern
screwed up my test.

01:22:01.552 --> 01:22:03.782
I never had mono.

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:07.627
So now we can, you know.

01:22:14.272 --> 01:22:15.546
So, what did you do?

01:22:15.712 --> 01:22:18.067
I told her
I would have to think about it.

01:22:18.792 --> 01:22:21.909
But ultimately you're gonna choose
in favour of sex, right?

01:22:22.512 --> 01:22:26.790
I don't know. Perhaps I can
better serve the world this way.

01:22:27.552 --> 01:22:30.908
You mean, not subjecting women
to your sexual advances?

01:22:32.592 --> 01:22:34.867
A simple joke from a simple man.

01:22:36.392 --> 01:22:38.303
So you're never gonna
have sex again?

01:22:38.472 --> 01:22:39.461
Well, Jerry...

01:22:39.632 --> 01:22:43.420
...there was a pretty good chance I was
never gonna have sex again anyway.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:46.584
You ready for the assembly
and what you'll say about the Yankees?

01:22:47.232 --> 01:22:50.224
Sports are so pedestrian.
I prepared some science experiments...

01:22:50.392 --> 01:22:53.190
...that will illuminate the mind
and dazzle the eye.

01:22:53.352 --> 01:22:56.901
I wrote a 20-minute bit about
how homework stinks.

01:22:58.832 --> 01:23:02.188
Oh, my vacation was restful,
resplendent, magnificent.

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:04.707
In fact, next time I'm planning on
going to Corfu.

01:23:05.712 --> 01:23:06.906
Oh, no.

01:23:07.072 --> 01:23:08.585
- We gotta talk.
- No way, Kramer.

01:23:08.752 --> 01:23:11.710
You brought me only misfortune
and humiliation. Now, get out.

01:23:11.872 --> 01:23:13.544
- But, Jackie.
- I said, out.

01:23:13.712 --> 01:23:16.545
Jackie, I think I got a case
against the tobacco companies.

01:23:17.832 --> 01:23:20.062
- The who?
- The tobacco companies.

01:23:24.112 --> 01:23:26.467
I've been wanting a piece of them
for years.

01:23:42.392 --> 01:23:45.668
Did that cigarette label mention
any damage to your appearance?

01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:48.630
- No, no, it didn't say anything.
- So you were a victim...

01:23:48.792 --> 01:23:51.989
...and now your face is
sallow, unattractive, disgusting.

01:23:53.032 --> 01:23:58.504
- So, Jackie, you think we got a case?
- Your face is my case.

01:24:06.032 --> 01:24:07.943
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you doing?

01:24:08.112 --> 01:24:10.580
Not good. I'm a moron.

01:24:11.552 --> 01:24:12.541
Don't worry about it.

01:24:12.712 --> 01:24:15.545
Once he passes the test,
you'll have sex and you'll be fine.

01:24:15.872 --> 01:24:18.864
Well, that kind of brings us
to why I'm here.

01:24:19.952 --> 01:24:22.022
You got 11 minutes?

01:24:23.512 --> 01:24:25.070
What for?

01:24:28.952 --> 01:24:30.305
Oh, come on.

01:24:30.472 --> 01:24:33.509
I just wanna clear my head.
It has nothing to do with you.

01:24:34.832 --> 01:24:37.505
I think it has something to do
with me.

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:41.460
You could read the paper
through the whole thing, if you want.

01:24:43.232 --> 01:24:47.111
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
This is too weird.

01:24:47.912 --> 01:24:50.062
All right.

01:24:50.232 --> 01:24:52.223
Is Kramer home?

01:24:55.232 --> 01:24:57.587
You know, Louise,
I think you'll find this amusing.

01:24:57.752 --> 01:25:02.268
- In early Euclidean geometry they...
- George, I have to have sex.

01:25:02.432 --> 01:25:04.309
I used to share
that very same outlook...

01:25:04.472 --> 01:25:06.781
...but now I have so many things
to occupy my mind.

01:25:06.952 --> 01:25:10.308
- For instance, the atom.
- Goodbye, George.

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.542
I hate you.

01:25:14.392 --> 01:25:16.747
Fascinating turn of events.

01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:26.626
Ms. Wilkie, your tobacco company
has turned this beautiful specimen...

01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:29.590
...into a horrible, twisted freak.

01:25:31.232 --> 01:25:32.506
Who could love me?

01:25:34.752 --> 01:25:40.827
I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer
projects a rugged masculinity.

01:25:44.312 --> 01:25:47.145
Rugged? The man's a goblin.

01:25:47.312 --> 01:25:49.382
He's only been exposed to smoke
for four days.

01:25:49.552 --> 01:25:53.306
By the time this case gets to trial, he'll
be nothing more than a shrunken head.

01:25:54.952 --> 01:25:58.342
All right, Mr. Chiles,
you'll have our offer by tomorrow.

01:25:58.512 --> 01:26:01.265
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Yeah, bye-bye.

01:26:01.712 --> 01:26:04.943
Jackie. Jackie, you did it.
We're rich.

01:26:05.112 --> 01:26:08.866
You better believe it. Jackie's cashing
in on your wretched disfigurement.

01:26:12.112 --> 01:26:15.104
Congratulations! You passed.

01:26:15.272 --> 01:26:18.742
Elaine, Elaine, I don't think
we should see each other anymore.

01:26:19.072 --> 01:26:21.063
What?
You're breaking me up with me?

01:26:21.232 --> 01:26:25.271
But I sacrificed and supported you
while you struggled.

01:26:25.872 --> 01:26:28.147
What about my dream
of dating a doctor?

01:26:28.312 --> 01:26:31.384
I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew
that after I became a doctor...

01:26:31.552 --> 01:26:34.271
...I would dump whoever I was with
and find someone better.

01:26:34.432 --> 01:26:37.788
That's the dream
of becoming a doctor.

01:26:38.672 --> 01:26:41.709
Lookit.
Are we gonna have sex or not?

01:26:44.112 --> 01:26:47.343
Jerry, when the glee club's finished
singing, George goes on, then you.

01:26:47.512 --> 01:26:50.743
- Hey.
- Where have you been? You're on next.

01:26:50.912 --> 01:26:52.345
I got lost on the way over.

01:26:52.512 --> 01:26:56.551
Got lost? We went to school here
for three years.

01:26:57.072 --> 01:27:01.270
What are these?
Take me to your leader.

01:27:03.712 --> 01:27:06.431
Oh, my God, you had sex.

01:27:07.712 --> 01:27:12.706
- You had sex with Louise.
- No, the Portuguese waitress.

01:27:12.872 --> 01:27:14.590
The Portuguese waitress?

01:27:14.752 --> 01:27:17.425
I calculated my odds
of ever getting together...

01:27:17.592 --> 01:27:21.471
...with a Portuguese waitress.
Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.

01:27:21.632 --> 01:27:22.860
George, George, you're on.

01:27:23.032 --> 01:27:25.910
- Oh, I'm not going on.
- What did you come down here for?

01:27:26.072 --> 01:27:28.586
To tell you
about the Portuguese waitress.

01:27:29.392 --> 01:27:31.064
It's good to have you back.

01:27:31.232 --> 01:27:35.305
- One of you has to go on.
- All right. I'll do it.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:40.864
Hey, kids,
what's the deal with homework?

01:27:41.032 --> 01:27:43.307
You're not working on your home.

01:27:47.312 --> 01:27:49.507
That was a great lunch, Jackie.
Thanks.

01:27:49.672 --> 01:27:51.867
It's puzzling we haven't
gotten that offer yet.

01:27:52.192 --> 01:27:54.911
Well, Mrs. Wilkie
from the tobacco company called me.

01:27:55.072 --> 01:27:56.346
And we had a little powwow.

01:27:56.512 --> 01:27:58.423
A powwow?
Who told you to have a powwow?

01:27:58.592 --> 01:28:00.742
I didn't tell you to have a powwow.

01:28:00.912 --> 01:28:03.187
- She made an offer. I took it.
- How much?

01:28:03.352 --> 01:28:06.549
- No, no, no. There was no money.
- No money? Then, what did we get?

01:28:08.432 --> 01:28:10.150
Check it out.

01:28:14.192 --> 01:28:17.468
This is the most public yet
of my many humiliations.

01:28:24.712 --> 01:28:27.829
Cancelled? But I was supposed to
be on tomorrow night.

01:28:27.992 --> 01:28:30.460
Yeah, but then,
some people were telling me about...

01:28:30.632 --> 01:28:34.147
...that little flap out there
at the junior high school assembly.

01:28:35.752 --> 01:28:39.028
And before that,
you were bumped by a lizard?

01:28:40.072 --> 01:28:42.267
It was a...
Actually, it was a monitor lizard.

01:28:42.432 --> 01:28:44.423
Those things, deadly, dangerous.

01:28:44.592 --> 01:28:48.221
A long time ago, my uncle and a date
are driving, like, through Mexico.

01:28:48.392 --> 01:28:49.711
They see one on the road.

01:28:49.872 --> 01:28:52.147
Drags him out of the car
and chews his face off.

01:28:52.592 --> 01:28:55.311
Listen. We'll call you if anything
opens up. Okay, Jimmy?

01:28:55.472 --> 01:28:57.861
- Jerry.
- Right. Jerry.

01:29:13.872 --> 01:29:14.941
Hey, you know what?

01:29:15.112 --> 01:29:17.262
It says "no food or drink."
Can't take that in.

01:29:17.432 --> 01:29:20.230
- Just wait here. I'll be right out.
- Wait a second. Come on.

01:29:22.152 --> 01:29:23.904
I wanna go in.

01:29:27.272 --> 01:29:28.830
I'm just running in.

01:29:31.152 --> 01:29:32.551
Come on. Come on.

01:29:47.432 --> 01:29:49.627
You know what?
They don't have batteries here.

01:29:49.792 --> 01:29:51.589
Let's go.

01:29:57.912 --> 01:29:59.903
Hey, Georgie's moving out.

01:30:00.072 --> 01:30:01.903
- Get out.
- I'm out.

01:30:02.072 --> 01:30:04.666
Fantastic apartment
right across from mine.

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.060
I can't wait for you to see.

01:30:06.552 --> 01:30:09.020
- Is it better than mine?
- Oh, yeah.

01:30:09.672 --> 01:30:12.744
So it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-
make-your-friends-hate-you.

01:30:12.912 --> 01:30:14.061
It's better than Elaine's.

01:30:14.232 --> 01:30:15.745
- Gotta give her a call.
- She's out.

01:30:15.912 --> 01:30:18.949
- Right, the blind date.
- Well, they like to call it a setup now.

01:30:19.112 --> 01:30:22.707
I guess the blind people don't like
being associated with all those losers.

01:30:22.872 --> 01:30:24.544
Come on,
come check out my new place.

01:30:25.072 --> 01:30:27.950
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer
down at my Mini Storage.

01:30:28.112 --> 01:30:29.386
Got any extra furniture there?

01:30:29.552 --> 01:30:32.942
I need some more stuff to fill that
extra bedroom with a walk-in closet.

01:30:33.392 --> 01:30:35.064
Oh, this is really annoying.

01:30:35.832 --> 01:30:37.390
It's working already.

01:30:40.912 --> 01:30:43.107
What is with that?

01:30:43.592 --> 01:30:45.025
Well, it's coughing, Jerry.

01:30:45.192 --> 01:30:48.787
It expels the diseased germs
out of the body into the air.

01:30:49.792 --> 01:30:52.989
- Where is your key?
- Yeah, well, Newman... He's got it.

01:30:53.152 --> 01:30:55.746
You know, Kramer,
I rented out half of my space to you.

01:30:55.912 --> 01:30:58.904
Yeah, and I rented out half that space
to Newman.

01:31:05.352 --> 01:31:06.546
Mailbags?

01:31:06.712 --> 01:31:08.145
He's storing mail in here?

01:31:08.312 --> 01:31:10.143
Evidently.

01:31:11.112 --> 01:31:12.306
Excuse me, George?

01:31:12.872 --> 01:31:14.146
No menus.

01:31:14.912 --> 01:31:18.746
No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi,
president of the tenants' association.

01:31:18.912 --> 01:31:20.982
Oh, right. Right. Hey.

01:31:21.152 --> 01:31:23.427
I love the floors in here.
It's like a gymnasium.

01:31:23.592 --> 01:31:26.345
- Try and guard me. Come on.
- No, no.

01:31:26.952 --> 01:31:31.468
George, unfortunately,
Clarence Eldridge, in 8C...

01:31:31.632 --> 01:31:33.827
...has decided
that he wants the apartment.

01:31:34.432 --> 01:31:36.070
Yeah, but you promised it to me.

01:31:36.232 --> 01:31:40.544
Yes, but you see, Mr. Eldridge
is an Andrea Doria survivor.

01:31:41.192 --> 01:31:44.821
And in light of the terrible suffering
that he's already been through...

01:31:44.992 --> 01:31:46.789
...we've decided to give it to him.

01:31:47.592 --> 01:31:49.184
Well...

01:31:49.352 --> 01:31:50.785
...the Andrea Doria.

01:31:51.552 --> 01:31:52.871
That was quite a fire.

01:31:53.352 --> 01:31:55.741
- Shipwreck.
- I remember it.

01:32:01.592 --> 01:32:04.868
Where is this guy? I hate this.

01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:07.547
I should have brought something
to read.

01:32:09.512 --> 01:32:12.151
"Cancer in laboratory animals."

01:32:13.192 --> 01:32:14.591
Excuse me. Elaine Benes?

01:32:14.752 --> 01:32:16.504
- Yeah?
- An Alan Mercer called for you.

01:32:16.672 --> 01:32:19.391
He said he's sorry,
but he won't be able to make it tonight.

01:32:19.552 --> 01:32:20.985
He's been stabbed.

01:32:23.552 --> 01:32:24.541
Stabbed?

01:32:25.352 --> 01:32:26.865
More bread?

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.391
You ate more bread?

01:32:34.312 --> 01:32:35.745
That is not the point.

01:32:35.912 --> 01:32:37.311
The guy was stabbed.

01:32:37.472 --> 01:32:39.110
- You find out who stabbed him?
- Yeah.

01:32:39.272 --> 01:32:41.911
It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.

01:32:43.112 --> 01:32:45.501
Well, you're not going near
this hooligan anymore.

01:32:46.632 --> 01:32:48.543
I don't know.
I mean, think about it, Jerry.

01:32:48.712 --> 01:32:50.862
There must be something exciting
about this guy...

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:54.627
...if he can arouse
that kind of passion.

01:32:56.672 --> 01:32:59.789
I mean, to be stabworthy,
you know? It's...

01:33:01.192 --> 01:33:03.342
It's kind of a compliment.

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:07.424
Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot.
He could have been the one.

01:33:09.512 --> 01:33:10.786
Hey, how's everybody?

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:12.067
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:33:13.472 --> 01:33:16.032
There's no expiration date on this.

01:33:17.352 --> 01:33:18.546
There is now.

01:33:20.392 --> 01:33:22.781
You should get that cough
checked out by a doctor.

01:33:22.952 --> 01:33:25.182
No, no, no. No doctors for me.

01:33:25.352 --> 01:33:29.391
Bunch of lackeys and yes men
all toeing the company line.

01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:32.830
Plus they botched my vasectomy.

01:33:32.992 --> 01:33:35.426
- They botched it?
- I'm even more potent now.

01:33:38.552 --> 01:33:40.907
- Hey.
- Hey, how's the new place?

01:33:41.072 --> 01:33:42.266
Gone.

01:33:42.432 --> 01:33:45.026
The tenant association
made me give it to this guy...

01:33:45.192 --> 01:33:47.342
...because he was
an Andrea Doria survivor.

01:33:48.032 --> 01:33:50.387
Andrea Doria? Is that the one
they did the song about?

01:33:50.552 --> 01:33:52.110
Edmund Fitzgerald.

01:33:52.272 --> 01:33:55.548
I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.

01:33:56.592 --> 01:34:00.380
No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer.
Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:02.543
You could fit 15 people
in that bathroom.

01:34:02.712 --> 01:34:04.703
I think Gordon Lightfoot
was the boat.

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:07.511
Yeah, and it was rammed
by the Cat Stevens.

01:34:08.272 --> 01:34:10.832
The Andrea Doria collided
with the Stockholm in dense fog...

01:34:10.992 --> 01:34:13.711
...12 miles off the coast
of Nantucket.

01:34:17.392 --> 01:34:19.110
- How do you know?
- It's in my book:

01:34:19.272 --> 01:34:21.786
Astonishing Tales of the Sea.

01:34:23.432 --> 01:34:24.945
Fifty-one people died.

01:34:25.112 --> 01:34:27.228
Fifty-one people?

01:34:27.392 --> 01:34:28.984
That's it?

01:34:29.392 --> 01:34:31.189
I thought it was like a thousand.

01:34:31.352 --> 01:34:33.820
There were 1660 survivors.

01:34:33.992 --> 01:34:35.903
That's no tragedy.

01:34:36.072 --> 01:34:40.145
How many people you lose
on a normal cruise, 30, 40?

01:34:40.312 --> 01:34:41.631
Can I look at that book?

01:34:41.792 --> 01:34:43.748
Oh, yeah.
I also got Astounding Bear Attacks.

01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:46.790
Before you go, did you talk to Newman
about getting that mail out?

01:34:46.952 --> 01:34:48.670
Oh, yeah. No, he's not gonna do it.

01:34:55.992 --> 01:34:58.950
- Newman?
- I guess.

01:34:59.472 --> 01:35:01.986
Listen, I want you to get the mail
out of my storage unit.

01:35:02.152 --> 01:35:04.950
Sometimes we don't get
what we want.

01:35:05.112 --> 01:35:07.910
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't get my transfer.

01:35:08.072 --> 01:35:10.427
- Transfer?
- To Hawaii.

01:35:10.592 --> 01:35:13.311
The most sought after postal route
of them all.

01:35:13.472 --> 01:35:17.670
The air is so dewy sweet, you don't
even have to lick the stamps.

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:21.184
But it's not to be.
So I'm hanging it up.

01:35:21.352 --> 01:35:23.912
- You quit the post office?
- Kind of.

01:35:24.072 --> 01:35:27.587
I'm still collecting checks,
I'm just not delivering mail.

01:35:29.032 --> 01:35:31.262
Well, get it out of my storage.
It's illegal.

01:35:31.432 --> 01:35:33.821
And yet it's perfectly legal
to take a man's soul...

01:35:33.992 --> 01:35:36.142
...and crush it out
like a stale Pall Mall.

01:35:36.312 --> 01:35:38.268
Well, the law's the law.

01:35:43.512 --> 01:35:44.547
Hold on there, it's...

01:35:44.712 --> 01:35:47.272
- It's a nasty cough you got there.
- What cough?

01:35:52.432 --> 01:35:54.787
I love shrimp. I'm a shrimp eater.

01:35:55.312 --> 01:35:59.191
You put shrimp in front of me,
and I'll eat it till my stomach pops.

01:36:00.792 --> 01:36:04.023
No, it's okay.
I'm still just a little bit jumpy.

01:36:04.712 --> 01:36:06.464
Between you and me...

01:36:06.632 --> 01:36:08.748
...what happened there,
with the stabbing?

01:36:08.912 --> 01:36:11.346
Just one of those things, you know.

01:36:11.512 --> 01:36:13.548
What, was she just so crazy
in love with you...

01:36:13.712 --> 01:36:15.589
...she just couldn't take it
anymore, or?

01:36:15.752 --> 01:36:17.504
I don't know. Could be.

01:36:18.152 --> 01:36:19.665
- Alan?
- Carol?

01:36:23.992 --> 01:36:26.301
Was that the one?
Was that the one who stabbed you?

01:36:26.472 --> 01:36:27.746
No, that was a different girl.

01:36:31.072 --> 01:36:33.028
There was another
crazed ex-girlfriend?

01:36:33.192 --> 01:36:36.070
Right. So I called my friend...
You know, the one who set us up?

01:36:36.232 --> 01:36:38.951
I found out
he's a bad breaker-upper.

01:36:39.952 --> 01:36:41.670
- Bad how?
- You know when you break up...

01:36:41.832 --> 01:36:43.424
...how you say things
you don't mean?

01:36:43.592 --> 01:36:45.071
He says things you don't mean...

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:46.506
...but means them.
- I follow.

01:36:46.672 --> 01:36:48.151
- What are you gonna do?
- Dump him.

01:36:48.312 --> 01:36:50.542
I can't be with someone
who doesn't break up nicely.

01:36:50.712 --> 01:36:52.828
That's an important part
of a relationship.

01:36:52.992 --> 01:36:54.505
What's more important?

01:36:58.672 --> 01:37:00.264
Hey.

01:37:00.712 --> 01:37:02.623
- What's with the dog?
- This is Smuckers.

01:37:02.792 --> 01:37:04.384
I borrowed him.

01:37:07.752 --> 01:37:09.549
Yeah, we share the same affliction.

01:37:09.712 --> 01:37:11.270
I'm gonna have a vet check us out.

01:37:11.432 --> 01:37:14.583
- A vet?
- I'll take a vet over an MD any day.

01:37:14.752 --> 01:37:18.711
They gotta cure a lizard, a chicken,
a pig, a frog, all on the same day.

01:37:18.872 --> 01:37:21.830
So if I may jump ahead...

01:37:21.992 --> 01:37:23.584
...you're gonna take dog medicine?

01:37:23.752 --> 01:37:25.982
You bet we are. How smart is that?

01:37:27.192 --> 01:37:28.864
See you.

01:37:32.312 --> 01:37:33.984
Ahoy, Mr. Eldridge.

01:37:37.152 --> 01:37:39.188
I understand you were on
the Andrea Doria.

01:37:39.352 --> 01:37:41.502
Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.

01:37:41.672 --> 01:37:45.506
I tell you, I hear people really stuff
themselves on those cruise ships.

01:37:45.672 --> 01:37:49.028
The buffet, that's the real ordeal,
huh, Clarence?

01:37:49.192 --> 01:37:50.625
We had to abandon ship.

01:37:50.792 --> 01:37:53.989
Well, all vacations
have to end eventually.

01:37:54.552 --> 01:37:55.746
The boat sank.

01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:58.710
According to this,
it took 10 hours.

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:02.069
It eased into the water like an old man
into a nice warm bath. No offence.

01:38:03.712 --> 01:38:06.146
So, Clarence, how about...

01:38:06.312 --> 01:38:08.872
...abandoning this apartment
and letting me shove off in it?

01:38:09.032 --> 01:38:10.351
Is that what this is about?

01:38:11.192 --> 01:38:12.545
I don't think I like you.

01:38:14.832 --> 01:38:17.027
It's my apartment, Eldridge.

01:38:17.192 --> 01:38:20.502
The Stockholm
may not have sunk you, but I will.

01:38:22.872 --> 01:38:24.066
What are the symptoms?

01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:26.746
Well, it hurts when he swallows...

01:38:26.912 --> 01:38:29.028
...especially when he drinks
orange juice.

01:38:29.192 --> 01:38:31.660
I mean, dog-food juice.

01:38:31.832 --> 01:38:33.902
And what's worse,
he has a nagging cough.

01:38:35.112 --> 01:38:37.023
That's it. That's it.

01:38:37.472 --> 01:38:39.667
Yeah, well, we've been seeing
a lot of this lately.

01:38:39.832 --> 01:38:41.504
Been drinking from the toilet?

01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:44.311
What? No.

01:38:45.192 --> 01:38:46.944
That's disgusting.

01:38:48.912 --> 01:38:50.470
So that's it? We're breaking up?

01:38:50.632 --> 01:38:51.826
What? Breakup?

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:55.268
- We went out on one date.
- Okay, yeah, sure, whatever you say.

01:38:56.112 --> 01:38:57.784
All right. Good, good.

01:38:57.952 --> 01:39:00.830
Okay, then, well...
So I'll see you around...

01:39:00.992 --> 01:39:02.471
...big head.

01:39:03.272 --> 01:39:05.911
- Pardon?
- You got a big head.

01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:07.425
It's too big for your body.

01:39:09.352 --> 01:39:10.546
That's it?

01:39:12.272 --> 01:39:14.422
That's the best you got?

01:39:15.632 --> 01:39:18.465
So he's keeping the apartment.
He doesn't deserve it, though.

01:39:18.632 --> 01:39:20.702
If he did suffer,
that was like 40 years ago.

01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:22.305
What have you done
for me lately?

01:39:22.472 --> 01:39:25.987
I've been suffering for the past 30
years up to and including yesterday.

01:39:26.152 --> 01:39:28.029
If this board is impressed
with suffering...

01:39:28.192 --> 01:39:31.150
...maybe you should tell them
the astonishing tales of Costanza.

01:39:33.752 --> 01:39:37.108
- I should.
- Your work in this field is unparalleled.

01:39:37.272 --> 01:39:39.581
I could go bummer-to-bummer
with anyone on the planet.

01:39:39.752 --> 01:39:41.344
You're the man.

01:39:43.912 --> 01:39:46.710
- Jerry...
- I'll be with you in a moment.

01:39:48.712 --> 01:39:50.782
So you want a protein shake
or something?

01:39:51.272 --> 01:39:53.069
I guess I should get moving
on this, huh?

01:39:53.232 --> 01:39:55.143
- I'm gonna go.
- All right.

01:39:57.192 --> 01:39:58.341
Hello, Newman.

01:39:58.512 --> 01:40:00.662
- That mail, where is it?
- What's the difference?

01:40:00.832 --> 01:40:02.788
The guy with the Hawaii transfer
got busted...

01:40:02.952 --> 01:40:04.908
...for hoarding
Victoria's Secret catalogs.

01:40:06.192 --> 01:40:07.671
I gotta deliver that mail.

01:40:07.832 --> 01:40:09.663
Well, go ahead.
There's eight bags of it.

01:40:09.832 --> 01:40:11.231
Blast.

01:40:11.392 --> 01:40:15.465
There's no way I can handle eight
in addition to my usual load of one.

01:40:16.192 --> 01:40:17.830
I'll never get to Hawaii.

01:40:17.992 --> 01:40:20.381
I'll be stuck
in this apartment building forever.

01:40:20.952 --> 01:40:22.590
The dream is dead.

01:40:22.752 --> 01:40:25.425
- You're giving up that easy?
- I usually do.

01:40:26.792 --> 01:40:28.271
- See you.
- Wait a minute, Newman.

01:40:28.432 --> 01:40:29.990
You can't let this dream die.

01:40:30.152 --> 01:40:32.382
You moving away is my dream too.

01:40:35.512 --> 01:40:37.468
- What are you proposing?
- Whatever it takes...

01:40:37.632 --> 01:40:39.827
...for as long as it takes,
wherever it takes me...

01:40:39.992 --> 01:40:42.267
...so long as it takes you
away from me.

01:40:42.432 --> 01:40:44.866
- An alliance?
- An alliance.

01:40:47.432 --> 01:40:49.468
Now get the hell out of here.

01:40:54.312 --> 01:40:57.429
Hawaii? That's why you're
helping Newman with the mail?

01:40:57.592 --> 01:41:00.026
Elaine,
Newman is my sworn enemy...

01:41:00.192 --> 01:41:04.265
...and he lives down the hall
from my home. My home, Elaine.

01:41:04.432 --> 01:41:07.583
Where I sleep,
where I come to play with my toys.

01:41:08.072 --> 01:41:09.744
Well, anyway, get this...

01:41:09.952 --> 01:41:11.146
...I spoke to Alan.

01:41:11.312 --> 01:41:13.542
You know, I told him
I didn't wanna see him anymore.

01:41:13.712 --> 01:41:15.225
Called me big head.

01:41:15.392 --> 01:41:16.620
Big head?

01:41:16.792 --> 01:41:18.384
It's almost a compliment.

01:41:19.432 --> 01:41:22.424
It's one of the nicest things
anyone has ever said to me.

01:41:25.352 --> 01:41:27.104
- Hello? Hey, George.
- Hey.

01:41:27.272 --> 01:41:30.105
- Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
- You can't make it?

01:41:30.272 --> 01:41:33.662
Yeah, the tenant association has
decided to hear my side of the story...

01:41:33.832 --> 01:41:35.823
...so I gotta kind of get ready.
I'll see you.

01:41:35.992 --> 01:41:37.345
All right.

01:41:37.512 --> 01:41:40.549
- Is he not gonna go?
- Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.

01:41:41.872 --> 01:41:44.705
- All right, well, I'll see you.
- All right.

01:41:48.672 --> 01:41:50.822
Kramer, aren't you taking
any medication for that?

01:41:50.992 --> 01:41:53.108
Yeah. Yeah, I got some pills.

01:41:53.272 --> 01:41:54.625
They taste terrible.

01:41:55.872 --> 01:41:58.670
- Just swallow them.
- Oh, my throat's too tender.

01:41:58.832 --> 01:42:00.743
- All right, sit down.
- I don't want to.

01:42:00.912 --> 01:42:03.301
- Come on. Just sit down.
- No, Jerry. What...?

01:42:03.472 --> 01:42:04.621
- Lay down.
- Why?

01:42:04.792 --> 01:42:06.703
- Sit down. Lean your head back.
- Hey!

01:42:06.872 --> 01:42:08.385
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

01:42:08.552 --> 01:42:11.020
Open it. Open it.

01:42:21.472 --> 01:42:23.940
What kind of pills are these
anyway?

01:42:24.112 --> 01:42:25.511
"For Smuckers"?

01:42:27.072 --> 01:42:30.508
"May cause panting
and loss of fur"?

01:42:32.032 --> 01:42:33.465
These are dog pills.

01:42:33.632 --> 01:42:35.065
We had the same symptoms.

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:37.666
But he's a dog.
You need to see a real doctor.

01:42:37.832 --> 01:42:39.026
No. No doctors.

01:42:39.192 --> 01:42:40.705
All right.

01:42:41.312 --> 01:42:42.461
Where are you going?

01:42:42.632 --> 01:42:44.862
I'm taking the car. I gotta run errands.
Wanna go?

01:42:45.032 --> 01:42:46.226
I don't know.

01:42:46.392 --> 01:42:48.542
Come on, you wanna go
for a ride, huh?

01:42:49.032 --> 01:42:51.626
Come on. Come on. Yeah.

01:42:57.552 --> 01:42:59.508
Lady, could you move your head
a little bit?

01:42:59.672 --> 01:43:02.630
- What?
- Your head. I can't see out the back.

01:43:04.992 --> 01:43:06.823
Little more.

01:43:08.552 --> 01:43:10.463
Little more.

01:43:13.992 --> 01:43:15.584
Thank you.

01:43:18.432 --> 01:43:20.741
I don't see any tissues back here.

01:43:21.072 --> 01:43:22.266
Wait a minute.

01:43:22.432 --> 01:43:24.866
This isn't the way to the park.

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.260
Where are we going?

01:43:26.792 --> 01:43:29.147
I recognize this block.

01:43:29.672 --> 01:43:31.185
You're taking me to the doctor.

01:43:32.992 --> 01:43:35.222
So, Mom, Dad...

01:43:35.432 --> 01:43:37.229
...I was hoping
that you could help me...

01:43:37.392 --> 01:43:40.065
...to remember my childhood
a little more clearly.

01:43:40.232 --> 01:43:43.144
I feel a draft. Let's change tables.

01:43:43.312 --> 01:43:44.870
Get out of here. We have a booth.

01:43:45.432 --> 01:43:47.343
Frank, I'm cold.

01:43:47.552 --> 01:43:49.190
Order a hot dish.

01:43:50.312 --> 01:43:52.223
Why can't we sit over there?

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:55.748
- That's not a booth.
- Who says we have to sit in a booth?

01:43:55.912 --> 01:43:59.109
I didn't take the subway to New York
to sit at a table like that!

01:43:59.312 --> 01:44:02.304
Well, I didn't take a subway
to be in a drafty restaurant!

01:44:02.472 --> 01:44:03.951
Mom...

01:44:04.112 --> 01:44:06.865
Now, George, what do you
wanna know about your childhood?

01:44:07.752 --> 01:44:10.425
Actually,
I think I'm pretty clear on it.

01:44:11.752 --> 01:44:14.061
Where's that breeze coming from?

01:44:14.472 --> 01:44:16.622
- Kramer, out of the car. Out now.
- No, Jerry.

01:44:16.792 --> 01:44:18.862
- All right. That's it. Come on.
- No. Jerry.

01:44:21.472 --> 01:44:23.940
Hey. Hey, get back over here.
Kramer.

01:44:24.112 --> 01:44:25.830
Get over here. You are bad.

01:44:25.992 --> 01:44:27.630
Bad neighbour.

01:44:27.792 --> 01:44:29.305
Kramer.

01:44:30.952 --> 01:44:34.911
Just then a rescue ship emerged
from the fog and saved us.

01:44:35.072 --> 01:44:36.425
It was...

01:44:39.712 --> 01:44:42.306
It was the sweetest sight
my eyes ever saw.

01:44:43.192 --> 01:44:44.944
Thank you, Mr. Eldridge.

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:48.543
The tenant board will now hear
Mr. Costanza's testimony.

01:44:55.432 --> 01:44:56.945
How'd it go? Get it all delivered?

01:44:57.352 --> 01:44:59.946
- What happened?
- Kramer bit me.

01:45:03.512 --> 01:45:05.389
- Bit you?
- We had an argument about me...

01:45:05.552 --> 01:45:08.828
...moving to Hawaii and he locked on
to my ankle like it was a soup bone.

01:45:10.352 --> 01:45:12.547
I'm hobbled.
I don't think I can do my route.

01:45:12.712 --> 01:45:15.101
And they're awarding the transfer
in two days.

01:45:15.272 --> 01:45:17.183
- Well, what if I delivered it?
- You?

01:45:20.512 --> 01:45:23.231
- You can't deliver mail.
- Why not?

01:45:25.032 --> 01:45:27.990
You're right. It's just walking around
and putting it in the boxes.

01:45:28.152 --> 01:45:31.747
- Well, what am I gonna wear?
- My uniform from my rookie year.

01:45:31.912 --> 01:45:34.301
I can't believe
I'm gonna be a mailman.

01:45:37.792 --> 01:45:40.386
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

01:45:40.552 --> 01:45:41.746
Mail on Sunday?

01:45:55.472 --> 01:45:59.988
I was handcuffed to the bed
in my underwear...

01:46:00.152 --> 01:46:01.346
...where I remained for...

01:46:01.512 --> 01:46:03.742
She certainly seemed interested
in me.

01:46:03.912 --> 01:46:07.700
Though she was attractive,
she was also, in fact, a Nazi.

01:46:07.872 --> 01:46:12.787
The water that I had been
swimming in was very cold...

01:46:13.192 --> 01:46:17.583
...and when I dropped the towel
there had been significant shrinkage.

01:46:18.312 --> 01:46:20.382
My parents were looking at me.

01:46:20.552 --> 01:46:22.508
So there I was...

01:46:23.272 --> 01:46:26.150
...with the marble rye hanging
from the end of a fishing pole.

01:46:26.312 --> 01:46:28.621
In closing, these stories
have not been embellished...

01:46:28.792 --> 01:46:30.623
...because they need
no embellishment.

01:46:31.112 --> 01:46:34.263
They are simply, horrifyingly,
the story of my life...

01:46:34.432 --> 01:46:38.505
...as a short, stocky,
slow-witted bald man.

01:46:39.032 --> 01:46:40.465
Thank you.

01:46:42.752 --> 01:46:44.424
Oh, also...

01:46:44.592 --> 01:46:48.426
...my fiancée died from licking
toxic envelopes that I picked out.

01:46:48.592 --> 01:46:50.264
Thanks again.

01:46:57.032 --> 01:46:59.830
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff
in the box like you told me...

01:46:59.992 --> 01:47:02.426
...but sometimes it says,
"Photographs: Do not bend."

01:47:02.592 --> 01:47:04.503
Do not bend.

01:47:05.672 --> 01:47:08.982
Just crease, crumple, cram.
You'll do fine.

01:47:12.232 --> 01:47:13.711
Hello?

01:47:14.152 --> 01:47:15.665
This is he.

01:47:16.352 --> 01:47:18.183
I don't understand.

01:47:20.232 --> 01:47:21.506
Very well.

01:47:22.312 --> 01:47:23.301
What?

01:47:23.472 --> 01:47:26.305
That was the vice president
of the post office.

01:47:27.832 --> 01:47:29.663
I didn't get the transfer.

01:47:29.832 --> 01:47:32.392
They knew it wasn't me
doing my route.

01:47:32.552 --> 01:47:33.701
How did they know?

01:47:33.872 --> 01:47:36.432
Too many people got their mail.

01:47:36.592 --> 01:47:38.184
Close to 80 percent.

01:47:38.352 --> 01:47:41.583
Nobody from the post office has ever
cracked the 50-percent barrier.

01:47:41.752 --> 01:47:43.390
It's like the three-minute mile.

01:47:43.552 --> 01:47:46.544
- I tried my best.
- Exactly.

01:47:46.712 --> 01:47:49.101
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

01:47:54.312 --> 01:47:56.064
You know, this is your coat.

01:47:56.352 --> 01:47:57.910
Damn.

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:07.428
He flew right into your head...

01:48:07.592 --> 01:48:09.150
...like he couldn't avoid it.

01:48:09.752 --> 01:48:11.151
Really?

01:48:11.312 --> 01:48:13.268
Never seen that before...

01:48:13.432 --> 01:48:15.627
...bird into a woman's head.

01:48:21.672 --> 01:48:23.947
There's no contest.
The guy had nothing.

01:48:24.112 --> 01:48:28.105
The ship went down,
he got into a lifeboat. Come on.

01:48:28.272 --> 01:48:30.422
Boy, he didn't know
what he was up against.

01:48:31.072 --> 01:48:32.903
So when do you move
into the apartment?

01:48:33.072 --> 01:48:35.586
They're making their decision today.

01:48:37.712 --> 01:48:39.782
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing...

01:48:39.952 --> 01:48:44.343
...except that a bird
ran into my giant freak head.

01:48:46.672 --> 01:48:47.946
What giant freak head?

01:48:48.112 --> 01:48:52.583
The one that sits atop
my disproportionately puny body.

01:48:53.592 --> 01:48:56.265
I'm a walking candy apple.

01:48:58.832 --> 01:49:00.868
So it's actually gotten to you?

01:49:01.032 --> 01:49:03.592
You're playing right into his hands.

01:49:03.752 --> 01:49:06.710
What? Yeah, you're right.

01:49:07.312 --> 01:49:10.588
All I have to do is call him up
and sit down with him...

01:49:10.752 --> 01:49:12.663
...and show him
that it doesn't bother me.

01:49:12.832 --> 01:49:14.424
You know, laugh it off.

01:49:14.592 --> 01:49:16.310
Or jam a fork into his forehead.

01:49:17.112 --> 01:49:18.750
- Either way.
- All right.

01:49:21.912 --> 01:49:24.267
- I want to apologize for...
- Oh, please.

01:49:24.432 --> 01:49:27.151
- And I hope we can get past all this.
- Past? We're way past.

01:49:27.312 --> 01:49:29.667
- So you have a big head.
- So what?

01:49:29.832 --> 01:49:32.187
Goes well with the bump
in your nose.

01:49:33.272 --> 01:49:34.341
What?

01:49:36.192 --> 01:49:40.151
Please, get help. There's a crazy,
bigheaded woman beating some guy.

01:49:40.312 --> 01:49:43.588
Tell the police
it's the Old Mill Restaurant. Hurry.

01:49:53.312 --> 01:49:55.303
That's some cough you got.

01:49:55.472 --> 01:49:57.110
He's trying
to tell us something.

01:49:57.272 --> 01:49:59.342
- What is it? Trouble?
- Trouble.

01:49:59.512 --> 01:50:01.025
Trouble where? Where's trouble?

01:50:01.192 --> 01:50:03.183
Old Mill.

01:50:03.352 --> 01:50:05.388
Trouble at the Old Mill?
Oh, my God.

01:50:05.552 --> 01:50:07.668
Good boy. Good boy.
Lead the way. Come on.

01:50:18.632 --> 01:50:21.066
Excuse me,
what are you doing in there?

01:50:21.232 --> 01:50:23.951
I'm moving in.
Alan Mercer, new neighbour.

01:50:24.112 --> 01:50:25.943
But, what...?
Elaine's "big head" guy?

01:50:26.712 --> 01:50:28.862
- They gave you the apartment?
- Yeah.

01:50:29.032 --> 01:50:31.148
Why? Because you were stabbed...

01:50:31.352 --> 01:50:33.229
...and got coffee thrown
in your face and...

01:50:33.392 --> 01:50:35.462
Oh, fork in the forehead.

01:50:36.072 --> 01:50:37.744
That's why
they gave you the apartment?

01:50:37.912 --> 01:50:40.380
No. Just gave the super 50 bucks.

01:50:41.072 --> 01:50:42.585
Wait a minute.
That is my apartment.

01:50:42.752 --> 01:50:45.266
I earned it with 34 years of misery.

01:50:45.432 --> 01:50:46.626
Tough luck, chinless.

01:51:10.117 --> 01:51:11.948
What happened to you yesterday?

01:51:12.117 --> 01:51:15.314
- I waited for you. You never came.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I got really busy.

01:51:15.477 --> 01:51:17.945
- How long did you wait?
- Five minutes.

01:51:18.877 --> 01:51:22.347
- Five minutes? That's it?
- No difference. You never showed up.

01:51:22.517 --> 01:51:24.075
Well, I could have.

01:51:24.237 --> 01:51:28.150
I mean, last week we waited for that
friend of Kramer's for like 40 minutes.

01:51:28.317 --> 01:51:29.750
We barely knew the guy.

01:51:29.917 --> 01:51:32.431
The longer you know someone,
the shorter you wait?

01:51:32.597 --> 01:51:35.589
- That's the way it works.
- When did you tell George to be here?

01:51:35.757 --> 01:51:38.032
I told him 10 minutes.
How long has it been?

01:51:38.197 --> 01:51:39.869
- About five.
- That's enough.

01:51:40.037 --> 01:51:41.356
Yeah.

01:51:48.797 --> 01:51:51.357
Early. All right.

01:51:54.077 --> 01:51:55.476
Cold.

01:52:00.797 --> 01:52:03.470
So I noticed you bounced
a cheque at the bodega.

01:52:03.637 --> 01:52:05.468
- How did you know about that?
- Marcelino.

01:52:05.637 --> 01:52:09.471
He taped it up on his cash register
with all of the other bad cheques.

01:52:09.637 --> 01:52:11.116
He can't do that.

01:52:11.277 --> 01:52:13.233
It's the only way you'll learn.

01:52:16.717 --> 01:52:19.277
Oh, these eggs are disgusting.

01:52:19.637 --> 01:52:22.674
Boy, this chicken should be
ashamed of himself.

01:52:22.837 --> 01:52:26.352
- Fantastic day, fantastic.
- What happened?

01:52:26.517 --> 01:52:29.668
Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth
and this piece of apple skin...

01:52:29.837 --> 01:52:33.147
...that must have been lodged
in there for days comes loose.

01:52:33.317 --> 01:52:35.956
- Fantastic.
- Then I'm at the foundation...

01:52:36.117 --> 01:52:38.153
- You're still doing that?
- Once in a while.

01:52:38.317 --> 01:52:39.306
When you feel guilty.

01:52:39.477 --> 01:52:41.866
No, occasionally I forget
to let the machine pick up.

01:52:42.037 --> 01:52:44.915
Anyway, they made this large donation
to a women's prison...

01:52:45.077 --> 01:52:47.637
...and I get to go down there
and check it out.

01:52:47.797 --> 01:52:49.230
- That's caged heat.
- Yeah.

01:52:49.837 --> 01:52:51.589
- What are you gonna do there?
- Nothing.

01:52:51.757 --> 01:52:55.909
Just stroll around the cellblocks,
maybe take in a shower fight.

01:52:57.717 --> 01:53:00.231
You got a bounced cheque
hanging up in the market...

01:53:00.397 --> 01:53:02.592
...over on Columbus.
- Yes, I know. I know.

01:53:02.757 --> 01:53:07.148
I noticed you chose
the clowns-with-balloon cheque design.

01:53:07.317 --> 01:53:09.467
It was a mistake.
The bank sent the wrong ones.

01:53:10.037 --> 01:53:11.993
Hey, look who's here.

01:53:12.157 --> 01:53:14.830
Hey, Kurt, this is Jerry
and George and Kramer.

01:53:14.997 --> 01:53:18.273
- Hey.
- Hey, Kurt, taste these eggs.

01:53:18.437 --> 01:53:21.076
No, I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.

01:53:21.237 --> 01:53:25.276
Yes. These are sweatshop eggs.

01:53:32.797 --> 01:53:35.994
I gotta call the office, honey.
Will you order for me?

01:53:36.557 --> 01:53:38.388
I'm a honey.

01:53:38.797 --> 01:53:40.196
He's pretty great, huh?

01:53:40.357 --> 01:53:42.507
Is he from the future?

01:53:44.277 --> 01:53:47.952
No, he just shaves his head.
I think it's pretty gutsy.

01:53:49.397 --> 01:53:52.195
Sweetheart, let me tell you
a little something about guts.

01:53:52.357 --> 01:53:54.632
This is guts.

01:53:56.277 --> 01:53:59.428
What? Clinging to some scraps?

01:54:00.837 --> 01:54:02.429
These are not scraps.

01:54:02.597 --> 01:54:07.068
These are historic remains
of a once-great society of hair.

01:54:07.677 --> 01:54:09.395
Did you guys stop
at the bodega today?

01:54:09.557 --> 01:54:13.630
Some moron bounced
a clown cheque.

01:54:19.957 --> 01:54:21.913
I'm sorry about the cheque,
Marcelino.

01:54:22.357 --> 01:54:24.746
People seem to like the clowns.

01:54:25.717 --> 01:54:29.107
Look, let me just give you the 40,
plus another 20 for your trouble.

01:54:29.277 --> 01:54:30.756
Okay.

01:54:34.637 --> 01:54:38.676
- Are you gonna take the cheque down?
- Sorry, no. Store policy.

01:54:38.837 --> 01:54:42.512
- But it's your bodega.
- Even I am not above the policy.

01:54:45.837 --> 01:54:48.829
- And those are our tennis courts.
- Tennis courts?

01:54:48.997 --> 01:54:52.273
What about the yard?
Where do they have the gang fights?

01:54:52.437 --> 01:54:56.510
There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza.
This is a minimum-security facility.

01:54:57.077 --> 01:54:59.033
What about a hole?

01:54:59.197 --> 01:55:02.553
- Do you ever put anybody in the box?
- No.

01:55:03.237 --> 01:55:04.909
This prison stinks.

01:55:05.557 --> 01:55:08.071
And finally the library,
which has been refurbished...

01:55:08.237 --> 01:55:09.909
...thanks to your generous donation.

01:55:10.077 --> 01:55:12.796
- This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.
- Nice to meet you.

01:55:12.957 --> 01:55:15.391
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
- Thanks, warden.

01:55:15.557 --> 01:55:16.910
Betsy.

01:55:18.397 --> 01:55:19.955
Betsy.

01:55:22.557 --> 01:55:24.149
Are you the head of the foundation?

01:55:24.317 --> 01:55:27.673
Well, let's just say
it wouldn't exist without me.

01:55:29.877 --> 01:55:32.949
So you two shop at the same store?

01:55:33.117 --> 01:55:35.028
No, it's standard issue.

01:55:35.557 --> 01:55:38.390
Oh, my God. You're in jail?

01:55:39.597 --> 01:55:42.031
That is so cool.

01:55:45.797 --> 01:55:47.310
You asked her out?

01:55:47.477 --> 01:55:52.153
Well, not out. She's a prisoner.

01:55:53.517 --> 01:55:56.270
- How could you ask her out?
- Why not?

01:55:56.437 --> 01:55:58.348
You wouldn't date
that girl from Queens...

01:55:58.517 --> 01:56:00.553
...because you didn't wanna
cross the bridge.

01:56:00.717 --> 01:56:02.548
- It was different.
- I'll say.

01:56:02.717 --> 01:56:04.708
Jerry, I like being with her.

01:56:04.877 --> 01:56:07.949
Plus, I know where she is
all the time.

01:56:09.237 --> 01:56:11.148
I have relatively no competition.

01:56:12.037 --> 01:56:14.153
You know how you live in fear
of the pop-in?

01:56:14.317 --> 01:56:15.591
- The pop-in.
- No pop-in...

01:56:15.757 --> 01:56:18.829
...no, "In the neighbourhood."
No, "I saw your light was on."

01:56:18.997 --> 01:56:21.386
And the best part is,
if things go really well...

01:56:21.557 --> 01:56:24.230
- Conjugal visit?
- Don't jinx it. Don't.

01:56:25.317 --> 01:56:26.955
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

01:56:27.117 --> 01:56:28.994
George is dating a convict.

01:56:29.157 --> 01:56:30.988
- What's she in for?
- Embezzlement.

01:56:31.157 --> 01:56:33.193
Sounds like a nice girl.

01:56:33.477 --> 01:56:36.389
Is it all right if I put some stuff
in your fridge? Mine's full.

01:56:36.557 --> 01:56:38.832
Yeah, sure.
You don't even have a fridge, do you?

01:56:38.997 --> 01:56:40.555
Well, not here.

01:56:42.437 --> 01:56:44.029
- Okay.
- Kramer...

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:46.188
Wait a minute. Wait.
What the hell is that?

01:56:46.357 --> 01:56:48.109
Well, it's chicken feed.

01:56:50.117 --> 01:56:52.233
I sense something is afoot.

01:56:54.597 --> 01:56:56.394
Yeah, I bought a chicken.

01:56:57.397 --> 01:56:58.876
Allow me.

01:56:59.797 --> 01:57:01.025
Why?

01:57:01.877 --> 01:57:04.311
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.

01:57:04.677 --> 01:57:06.474
Allow me.

01:57:06.637 --> 01:57:08.753
- What are you? An idiot?
- No.

01:57:09.877 --> 01:57:11.833
Hold it. Hold it.
Here. I got it. Catch.

01:57:15.957 --> 01:57:17.788
Hey, driver's license.

01:57:19.517 --> 01:57:22.111
Oh, my God.

01:57:22.277 --> 01:57:25.314
- What?
- Your hair.

01:57:25.477 --> 01:57:27.786
It's so thick and lustrous.

01:57:29.197 --> 01:57:30.994
I mean, it was.

01:57:31.157 --> 01:57:32.431
Well, it still is.

01:57:32.597 --> 01:57:34.588
I shaved my head for my swim team.

01:57:34.757 --> 01:57:37.225
I just liked the way it looked,
so I kept it.

01:57:37.397 --> 01:57:40.833
Are you saying
that I could be dating this hair?

01:57:41.157 --> 01:57:43.466
I mean, with you under it?

01:57:59.917 --> 01:58:01.111
Hey.

01:58:01.277 --> 01:58:03.427
Is that your chicken
making all that noise?

01:58:03.597 --> 01:58:05.827
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.

01:58:06.597 --> 01:58:08.906
- Who?
- Little Jerry Seinfeld.

01:58:10.597 --> 01:58:13.236
- I named my chicken after you.
- Thanks. That's very sweet.

01:58:13.397 --> 01:58:15.035
But that is not a chicken.

01:58:15.197 --> 01:58:17.995
Of course it is.
I picked it out myself.

01:58:18.157 --> 01:58:19.795
Well, you picked out a rooster.

01:58:20.717 --> 01:58:24.107
Well, that would explain
Little Jerry's poor egg production.

01:58:32.717 --> 01:58:35.390
- This was fun.
- Yeah, I had a great time.

01:58:35.557 --> 01:58:37.149
Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.

01:58:37.317 --> 01:58:39.672
The whole hour just flew by.

01:58:39.837 --> 01:58:42.909
- I'll get that.
- Thanks, Bobby.

01:58:43.517 --> 01:58:46.190
Well, I guess
I'll see you in four days.

01:58:46.357 --> 01:58:48.427
Yeah. Go out
and have a ball with the guys.

01:58:48.597 --> 01:58:50.553
I'll be waiting right here for you.

01:58:50.717 --> 01:58:52.833
Of course you will.

01:58:52.997 --> 01:58:54.396
You're the best.

01:58:57.797 --> 01:58:59.708
- Hello.
- Jerry...

01:58:59.877 --> 01:59:01.788
...Leo told us
he saw your bounced cheque.

01:59:01.957 --> 01:59:05.347
- Are you having money problems?
- I'm not having money problems.

01:59:05.517 --> 01:59:07.428
Enough with the comedy.
You're very clever.

01:59:07.597 --> 01:59:09.269
You should look into advertising.

01:59:09.437 --> 01:59:12.793
He never even called Ed Roydlick.
They were looking for someone.

01:59:12.957 --> 01:59:15.517
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick.
I'm doing fine.

01:59:15.677 --> 01:59:18.191
That's it. I'm gonna send you $50.

01:59:18.357 --> 01:59:20.109
You are not sending me $50.

01:59:20.277 --> 01:59:22.745
We're sending you $50.
Morty, get me an envelope.

01:59:22.917 --> 01:59:27.069
I swear to God, if you send me $50,
you are gonna be so sorry.

01:59:27.237 --> 01:59:29.910
- I don't see envelopes.
- They're right in front of you.

01:59:30.077 --> 01:59:32.671
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Let me show you.

01:59:32.837 --> 01:59:36.591
Ma, Ma, Ma!

01:59:39.437 --> 01:59:42.190
- How are the folks?
- Good.

01:59:42.357 --> 01:59:45.394
- So movie tonight?
- I thought you were going with Celia.

01:59:45.557 --> 01:59:46.990
I did. I'm back.

01:59:47.157 --> 01:59:49.625
I love this relationship.
I feel so liberated.

01:59:50.597 --> 01:59:51.950
Having her in jail?

01:59:52.117 --> 01:59:55.473
Yeah, the only thing that bothers me
is I'm just coming up with this now.

01:59:56.597 --> 02:00:00.033
Yeah, dating a convicted felon.
I don't know how you missed it.

02:00:00.557 --> 02:00:03.071
Here. Take a look at that.

02:00:04.117 --> 02:00:05.311
Kurt's an organ donor.

02:00:06.157 --> 02:00:08.432
No, he's not bald.

02:00:08.597 --> 02:00:10.474
Look, he's got a full head of hair.

02:00:10.637 --> 02:00:12.753
So he just shaves his head
for no reason?

02:00:12.917 --> 02:00:15.556
That's like using a wheelchair
for the fun of it.

02:00:16.677 --> 02:00:18.588
And he's growing it in just for me.

02:00:18.757 --> 02:00:21.590
It's mine. It's all mine.

02:00:21.757 --> 02:00:25.716
- It's just hair.
- No, it's not just hair. Look.

02:00:25.877 --> 02:00:30.997
- It's brown.
- It's chestnut with auburn highlights.

02:00:31.317 --> 02:00:33.706
- So?
- You know, you're not around women.

02:00:33.877 --> 02:00:38.189
You don't know how important
a man's hair is.

02:00:42.837 --> 02:00:44.907
I'm sorry, George, but it's true.

02:00:45.077 --> 02:00:46.669
I knew it.

02:00:52.197 --> 02:00:53.186
Hey.

02:00:53.677 --> 02:00:56.749
- Hey, Kramer, nice rooster.
- Yeah.

02:00:56.917 --> 02:00:59.431
- What's his name?
- Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.

02:00:59.597 --> 02:01:04.307
Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Does he bounce cheques?

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.868
Look, can't you take
Jerry's cheque down?

02:01:07.037 --> 02:01:08.311
Sorry, Kramer, can't help.

02:01:09.397 --> 02:01:11.467
Hey, hey, Jerry. Come on.

02:01:11.637 --> 02:01:12.911
Oh, sorry.

02:01:13.077 --> 02:01:16.513
- I like the way he handles himself.
- Oh, yeah.

02:01:23.797 --> 02:01:26.948
- Oh, it's coming in already.
- Yeah.

02:01:27.117 --> 02:01:31.668
Wow, you have some
very nice little seedlings here.

02:01:34.677 --> 02:01:36.190
- What?
- Well, it doesn't seem...

02:01:36.357 --> 02:01:41.385
...to be coming in
so good over here or here.

02:01:42.197 --> 02:01:45.712
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know.

02:01:45.877 --> 02:01:48.027
How long have you been shaving
your head for?

02:01:48.197 --> 02:01:49.915
About three years.

02:01:51.317 --> 02:01:52.796
Oh, my God.

02:01:53.717 --> 02:01:55.230
I'm going bald.

02:01:57.997 --> 02:02:00.591
George, I'm so glad to see you.

02:02:00.757 --> 02:02:02.873
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes.

02:02:03.037 --> 02:02:04.993
You buy
yourself something nice.

02:02:05.157 --> 02:02:07.796
Good news. I'm up for parole.

02:02:10.837 --> 02:02:15.274
Parole? That's dynamite.

02:02:17.237 --> 02:02:18.829
Marcelino's taking down the cheque?

02:02:18.997 --> 02:02:22.353
Yeah, well, it comes down if Little
Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.

02:02:22.517 --> 02:02:23.791
Great.

02:02:24.397 --> 02:02:25.625
What?

02:02:25.797 --> 02:02:28.914
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights
in the back of his store.

02:02:29.077 --> 02:02:31.386
Yeah, so he says
if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins...

02:02:31.557 --> 02:02:33.195
...the cheque comes down.

02:02:33.357 --> 02:02:34.870
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.

02:02:35.037 --> 02:02:36.834
Only in the United States.

02:02:36.997 --> 02:02:39.557
- It's inhumane.
- Jerry, it's not what you think it is.

02:02:39.717 --> 02:02:42.106
It's two roosters pecking
at each other.

02:02:43.157 --> 02:02:44.510
- What?
- Yeah.

02:02:45.557 --> 02:02:48.469
Well, I thought
they wore gloves and helmets.

02:02:48.637 --> 02:02:50.992
You know,
like American Gladiators.

02:02:51.157 --> 02:02:53.227
No, Kramer,
Little Jerry could get hurt.

02:02:53.397 --> 02:02:54.796
I left him with Marcelino.

02:02:55.757 --> 02:02:57.554
My Little Jerry.

02:03:04.117 --> 02:03:06.028
Hey, did you get Little Jerry?
Is he okay?

02:03:06.197 --> 02:03:08.665
Oh, well, he's more than okay.
He won.

02:03:09.397 --> 02:03:11.865
- You let him fight?
- I couldn't get there in time.

02:03:12.037 --> 02:03:13.993
But you should've seen
Little Jerry, Jerry.

02:03:14.157 --> 02:03:17.194
Flapping his wings
and strutting his stuff.

02:03:17.357 --> 02:03:21.635
He was pecking and weaving
and bobbing and talking trash.

02:03:21.797 --> 02:03:25.107
He didn't even have to touch him.
The other rooster ran out of the ring.

02:03:26.317 --> 02:03:28.069
The whole fight lasted two seconds.

02:03:28.237 --> 02:03:30.705
- How long do they usually last?
- Five seconds.

02:03:30.877 --> 02:03:33.152
Marcelino says he's taking
your cheque down today.

02:03:33.317 --> 02:03:35.467
- Great.
- Hey.

02:03:35.637 --> 02:03:38.515
- Celia is up for parole.
- Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:40.986
- What?
- Who?

02:03:42.317 --> 02:03:43.875
I'm too tired.

02:03:44.317 --> 02:03:46.512
Listen. I want you to come by later,
all right?

02:03:46.677 --> 02:03:48.429
- We're having a victory party.
- Okay.

02:03:50.877 --> 02:03:53.869
It's over, Jerry. She's getting out.

02:03:54.037 --> 02:03:55.470
I'm so sorry.

02:03:56.677 --> 02:03:58.269
She's been locked up for two years.

02:03:58.437 --> 02:04:01.235
She's gonna want to make up
for lost time.

02:04:01.397 --> 02:04:04.867
Dinners, movies, talking.

02:04:06.317 --> 02:04:08.035
In other words,
a normal relationship.

02:04:08.597 --> 02:04:10.508
That's no good.

02:04:11.717 --> 02:04:14.993
I've tried it straight, Jerry.
We've all seen the results.

02:04:15.157 --> 02:04:16.590
I think for me...

02:04:17.397 --> 02:04:19.752
...sick is the only way to go.

02:04:19.917 --> 02:04:21.873
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.

02:04:22.037 --> 02:04:23.789
It's not the same.

02:04:23.957 --> 02:04:26.551
Hey, if you two
were meant to be together...

02:04:26.717 --> 02:04:29.026
...l'm sure the cops
will pick her up on something.

02:04:32.477 --> 02:04:34.035
Kurt?

02:04:35.637 --> 02:04:38.913
What's with the sweats?
Aren't we going out?

02:04:39.077 --> 02:04:41.068
I don't care.

02:04:42.557 --> 02:04:45.674
You got a big stain on your shirt.

02:04:45.837 --> 02:04:48.431
Oh, yeah, a meatball
fell out of my sandwich.

02:04:48.597 --> 02:04:50.155
You already ate?

02:04:50.317 --> 02:04:52.114
It's from yesterday.

02:04:55.797 --> 02:04:58.357
Jerry, you missed a hell
of a cockfight last night.

02:04:58.517 --> 02:05:01.190
Then what is my cheque still doing up?
We had a deal.

02:05:01.357 --> 02:05:03.507
- Now we have a new deal.
- New deal?

02:05:03.677 --> 02:05:07.306
When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine,
the cheque will be yours.

02:05:07.477 --> 02:05:09.468
This is outrageous.

02:05:09.637 --> 02:05:10.831
Pack of Juicy Fruit.

02:05:11.957 --> 02:05:14.027
- Eighty-five cents.
- Eighty-five cents?

02:05:14.277 --> 02:05:16.233
That is outrageous.

02:05:18.237 --> 02:05:20.956
Marcelino wants us
to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.

02:05:21.117 --> 02:05:22.550
That's out of the question.

02:05:22.717 --> 02:05:25.185
But cockfighting is
an illegal and immoral activity.

02:05:25.357 --> 02:05:29.987
Yeah, if you've got a loser.
But Little Jerry was born to cockfight.

02:05:30.157 --> 02:05:31.590
No, no more cockfighting.

02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:34.555
Let's just sell him to Marcelino
and be done with it.

02:05:34.717 --> 02:05:36.275
- I think you're jealous.
- Of what?

02:05:38.157 --> 02:05:42.514
Yeah, you see in Little Jerry Seinfeld
the unlimited future you once had.

02:05:42.677 --> 02:05:45.350
Now, just because
Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been...

02:05:45.517 --> 02:05:47.906
...don't make
Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was.

02:05:48.077 --> 02:05:49.954
- Kramer, give me that rooster.
- Never!

02:05:50.117 --> 02:05:53.553
You hate him because he's doing more
with your name than you ever will!

02:05:58.197 --> 02:06:01.712
George, Celia has listed you
as a character reference.

02:06:01.877 --> 02:06:06.155
Whatever you can tell us would be
helpful in her getting parole.

02:06:07.637 --> 02:06:10.197
Well, anything I could do to help.

02:06:10.357 --> 02:06:15.306
She's a wonderful girl.
Very smart, very crafty.

02:06:15.957 --> 02:06:18.027
Does she have any plans
after she's released?

02:06:18.197 --> 02:06:20.028
Plans. Schemes.

02:06:20.197 --> 02:06:23.314
She keeps talking about getting
back together with her old friends.

02:06:23.477 --> 02:06:26.275
You know, "the gang,"
she likes to call them.

02:06:26.437 --> 02:06:29.713
Yeah, they're hatching something.
You can count on that.

02:06:32.957 --> 02:06:36.916
Jerry, tomorrow night is fight night.
Where's my rooster?

02:06:37.077 --> 02:06:39.272
- Kramer won't sell.
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.

02:06:39.437 --> 02:06:41.189
I'm gonna take down
your cheque anyway.

02:06:41.357 --> 02:06:42.631
Well, thank you, Marcelino.

02:06:42.797 --> 02:06:45.550
Well, perhaps some day
you will do me a favour.

02:06:45.717 --> 02:06:46.945
And that day is today.

02:06:48.397 --> 02:06:50.115
Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down...

02:06:50.277 --> 02:06:52.507
...in the third round
of tomorrow's main event.

02:06:52.677 --> 02:06:55.316
- You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
- Not so loud.

02:06:55.477 --> 02:06:58.355
First of all, I don't think
you can make a rooster take a dive.

02:06:58.517 --> 02:07:00.587
- Can too.
- Second of all...

02:07:00.757 --> 02:07:02.349
...Jerry Seinfeld, big or little...

02:07:02.517 --> 02:07:04.906
...doesn't go down for anyone,
anywhere, at any time.

02:07:05.077 --> 02:07:07.147
Now, I'd appreciate it
if you'd please leave.

02:07:07.317 --> 02:07:10.707
Big Jerry is making
a big mistake, Jerry.

02:07:10.877 --> 02:07:12.708
We'll see about that.

02:07:16.037 --> 02:07:18.312
Kramer, I'm coming up.
We got a cockfight to win.

02:07:18.477 --> 02:07:19.751
Okay.

02:07:20.117 --> 02:07:23.871
Elaine said you would be
the best person I could talk to.

02:07:24.117 --> 02:07:27.951
Yeah, classic horseshoe pattern.

02:07:28.117 --> 02:07:30.028
- I've seen a lot of this.
- Oh, God.

02:07:30.197 --> 02:07:32.267
No, no, Kurt, wrong attitude.

02:07:32.437 --> 02:07:34.712
- You should be happy.
- Why should I be happy?

02:07:34.877 --> 02:07:36.788
You've still got
pretty good coverage.

02:07:36.957 --> 02:07:40.836
Once the enemy advances
beyond this perimeter...

02:07:42.237 --> 02:07:43.955
...then you won't be Kurt anymore.

02:07:44.677 --> 02:07:45.666
What will I be?

02:07:51.317 --> 02:07:56.152
- How long do I have?
- Fourteen months, maybe 10.

02:07:56.317 --> 02:07:58.877
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes...

02:07:59.637 --> 02:08:00.831
...live, damn it.

02:08:00.997 --> 02:08:05.866
Live every precious moment as
if this was the last year of your life...

02:08:06.037 --> 02:08:07.629
...because in many ways...

02:08:08.637 --> 02:08:09.706
...it is.

02:08:12.917 --> 02:08:14.396
Excuse me.

02:08:17.237 --> 02:08:19.228
Celia, what are you doing here?

02:08:19.397 --> 02:08:21.865
Well, I didn't get my parole,
so I busted out.

02:08:22.037 --> 02:08:24.073
And you just decided to pop in?

02:08:31.517 --> 02:08:34.315
- Kurt.
- Elaine, will you marry me?

02:08:36.437 --> 02:08:38.553
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:08:40.197 --> 02:08:42.028
- He's looking good, huh, Jerry?
- Yeah.

02:08:42.597 --> 02:08:44.633
All right.
I think that's enough for today.

02:08:47.957 --> 02:08:50.630
Little Jerry is a lean, mean,
pecking machine.

02:08:51.677 --> 02:08:54.714
- What are you doing with that?
- I'm just gonna heat this up.

02:08:54.877 --> 02:08:56.913
Make a little hot tub for Little Jerry.

02:08:57.557 --> 02:08:59.195
Hey, Kramer...

02:08:59.877 --> 02:09:01.390
...be careful.
- Yeah.

02:09:02.277 --> 02:09:03.471
- Hey.
- Hey, guess what.

02:09:03.637 --> 02:09:06.674
Little Jerry ran from here
to Newman's in under 30 seconds.

02:09:06.837 --> 02:09:09.192
- Is that good?
- I don't know.

02:09:10.197 --> 02:09:12.757
- Where have you been?
- Celia broke out of prison.

02:09:13.477 --> 02:09:15.468
I'm at home,
she shows up at the door.

02:09:15.637 --> 02:09:19.186
- Oh, my God, the break out pop-in.
- Yeah.

02:09:19.357 --> 02:09:20.585
And, Jerry, listen to this.

02:09:20.757 --> 02:09:23.510
I've discovered something better
than conjugal-visit sex.

02:09:23.677 --> 02:09:25.713
Fugitive sex.

02:09:25.877 --> 02:09:27.549
- It's like every time...
- George.

02:09:27.717 --> 02:09:30.550
This is a little too much.
Escape convicts, fugitive sex...

02:09:30.717 --> 02:09:32.150
I got a cockfight to focus on.

02:09:37.477 --> 02:09:39.786
Hey, hey, Kurt, slow down.

02:09:39.957 --> 02:09:42.346
I can't just marry you.

02:09:42.517 --> 02:09:45.236
I mean, I need some fiancée time.

02:09:45.397 --> 02:09:48.469
I need some
make-my-girlfriends-jealous time.

02:09:48.637 --> 02:09:50.195
Plus, you want to get to know me.

02:09:50.357 --> 02:09:53.235
Yeah, yeah, that too.

02:09:53.397 --> 02:09:56.833
- Well, how much time?
- I don't know. A year?

02:09:56.997 --> 02:09:58.555
No, no, no, it has to be now.

02:10:00.597 --> 02:10:02.986
Could I see the ring again?

02:10:07.757 --> 02:10:09.349
So you're actually considering it?

02:10:09.517 --> 02:10:12.668
Well, it will be a couple of years
before he's completely bald.

02:10:12.837 --> 02:10:14.236
Those will be good times.

02:10:14.397 --> 02:10:17.230
Marriage is a big step, Elaine.
Your life will totally change.

02:10:17.397 --> 02:10:20.230
Jerry, it's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm at a cockfight.

02:10:20.397 --> 02:10:21.989
What am I clinging to?

02:10:24.277 --> 02:10:25.266
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:10:25.437 --> 02:10:26.995
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where's Celia?

02:10:27.157 --> 02:10:30.354
She didn't wanna come.
She's not really into sports.

02:10:30.637 --> 02:10:33.470
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Well, he's got a big sweat going.

02:10:33.637 --> 02:10:37.107
Oh, this came for you Express Mail.
It's from your parents.

02:10:37.277 --> 02:10:38.392
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:10:39.077 --> 02:10:42.035
"Fifty dollars."
I don't believe this.

02:10:42.637 --> 02:10:44.628
There's Marcelino.

02:10:45.717 --> 02:10:48.277
Look at the size of his bird.

02:10:48.437 --> 02:10:51.793
That looks like a dog
with a glove on his head.

02:10:55.277 --> 02:10:57.029
Hi, is George back
from the cockfight?

02:10:57.197 --> 02:10:59.233
I've got to thank him.
He changed my life.

02:10:59.397 --> 02:11:01.228
Must've been a good fight.
He's not back.

02:11:01.397 --> 02:11:02.386
Damn.

02:11:02.797 --> 02:11:04.992
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza.

02:11:05.157 --> 02:11:07.227
Well, well, well, look who's here.

02:11:07.397 --> 02:11:08.591
Oh, man.

02:11:08.757 --> 02:11:10.429
Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest...

02:11:10.597 --> 02:11:12.872
...for aiding and abetting
a known fugitive.

02:11:13.037 --> 02:11:15.153
- I'm not George Costanza.
- Save it.

02:11:15.317 --> 02:11:18.946
We know you're bald.
We know it's you. Let's go.

02:11:21.797 --> 02:11:23.310
Okay. I got the whole scoop.

02:11:23.477 --> 02:11:25.786
Marcelino flew the bird in
from Ecuador.

02:11:25.957 --> 02:11:28.391
- He's 68-0.
- He's a ringer.

02:11:28.557 --> 02:11:29.990
Where's the tamale guy?

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:34.387
Little Jerry's gonna get
his clock cleaned.

02:11:34.557 --> 02:11:36.593
I've gotta get him out of there.

02:11:38.797 --> 02:11:41.391
Little Jerry!

02:11:41.557 --> 02:11:44.469
Kramer!

02:11:45.717 --> 02:11:50.188
Stop the fight!

02:11:51.277 --> 02:11:54.474
Tamale!

02:12:15.157 --> 02:12:17.227
Why did you get into
a fistfight with the cop?

02:12:17.397 --> 02:12:19.672
- You were innocent.
- They thought I was George.

02:12:19.837 --> 02:12:21.748
I'm not that bald.

02:12:21.917 --> 02:12:25.466
And I have too little time left
to take that crap, so I slugged him.

02:12:25.917 --> 02:12:27.873
How long are you
gonna be in here for?

02:12:28.037 --> 02:12:32.474
Well, my lawyer says 14 months,
but with good behaviour maybe 10.

02:12:34.557 --> 02:12:37.788
- So 10 to 14 months?
- Yeah.
