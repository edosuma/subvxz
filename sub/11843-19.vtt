00:00.567 --> 00:02.262
- Previously on Roswell:
- Who are you?

00:02.335 --> 00:04.463
- I'm Tess.
- You're the new girl, right?

00:04.537 --> 00:06.869
- She's <i>my friend.</i>
- <i>She'; a stranger, Isabel.</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:09.773
Max! My car broke down.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.608
You're doing
something to me.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.110
I saw you, Max.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.619
The way I'm drawn to her--
It's not just attraction.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.314
It's something else.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.949
[Grunts]
Let go.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.655
<i>[ Isabel]
Someone's been watching us?</i>

00:29.729 --> 00:32.061
<i>[ Michael]
Maybe it's Tess and her father.</i>

00:32.131 --> 00:35.067
lfthey're F.B.l., they'd have access.
We should check them out some more.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.537
Before you can expect someone to trust
you, you've gotta trust them first.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.404
Whenever you're ready, Max.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.500
What is that,
like porn or something?

00:44.577 --> 00:46.739
We're using it
to spy on Tess, all right?

00:46.813 --> 00:49.009
- Max, Michael.
- What's going on?

00:54.087 --> 00:56.181
Oh, my God.

01:07.833 --> 01:10.768
I'm finally ready
to let someone in...

01:10.836 --> 01:13.271
and I want him to be you.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.839
I've been waiting
to hear that, Isabel.

01:18.911 --> 01:21.471
And I want to be
the one for you...

01:21.547 --> 01:24.141
because you're
the only one for me.

02:05.191 --> 02:08.252
Isabel. Isabel.

02:09.362 --> 02:12.059
Isabel, wake up.
She's moving around.

02:16.001 --> 02:18.095
<i>[ Isabel]
Okay.</i>

02:32.618 --> 02:35.485
- Hello?
- [ Isabel On Phone] Maria, are you up?

02:35.554 --> 02:38.455
- Yeah, we're awake.
- She's leaving now.

02:38.524 --> 02:40.458
We're on it.

02:42.228 --> 02:45.198
<i>[ Liz] I knew you weren't really
falling in love with her.</i>

02:45.264 --> 02:47.756
It's the truth, Liz.
You've gotta believe that.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.200
I do. And now we know
it's really Nasedo.

02:50.269 --> 02:53.432
Whoever Nasedo really is,
it's using Tess's body to get to me.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.874
- Right, to manipulate you.
- I can't control myself when I'm with her.

02:56.942 --> 02:59.468
<i>[ Cell Phone Rings]</i>

02:59.545 --> 03:03.140
Yeah, we're in position.
Okay. We got it.

03:03.215 --> 03:05.843
She's in the parking lot,
headed this way.

03:14.827 --> 03:17.023
<i>[ Liz ]
Okay, I'll take it from here.</i>

03:17.096 --> 03:19.224
<i>Wait. I don't want you
going in there alone.</i>

03:19.298 --> 03:21.426
Max, she still thinks
I'm just your girlfriend.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.434
She'll never
suspect anything.

03:23.502 --> 03:26.267
She's dangerous.
Don't ever forget that.

03:26.338 --> 03:29.467
<i>[ School Bell Rings ]</i>

04:00.806 --> 04:04.936
[Gasps ] Tess! I thought
I saw you come in here.

04:05.010 --> 04:08.947
Look, Liz, I thought we got everything
straightened out last night.

04:09.014 --> 04:11.381
- We did?
- I mean about Max.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.976
We're gonna try
and be friends, right?

04:14.053 --> 04:17.182
- All of us.
- Right. Friends.

04:19.058 --> 04:23.495
Then tell me, why is
everybody following me?

04:30.402 --> 04:33.599

05:13.812 --> 05:16.144
<i>[ Maria] So she didn't hurt you
or threaten you?</i>

05:16.215 --> 05:18.206
<i>[ Liz ]
No. She acted totally innocent.</i>

05:18.284 --> 05:21.413
I'm telling you. She has no idea
that we found out about her.

05:21.487 --> 05:25.481
- [ Max] You can't trust anything she says.
- Maybe we should trust her.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.084
This is the fourth alien
we've been waiting for our whole lives.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.427
I don't think anyone that would pretend to be
a teenage girl to seduce Max is on our side.

05:32.498 --> 05:36.332
<i>Isabel's right.
It's a shape-shifter.</i>

05:36.402 --> 05:39.565
Who knows what other powers
it has that we don't have?

05:39.638 --> 05:42.767
The three of us, no matter what
we may discover about ourselves...

05:42.841 --> 05:45.367
we were raised human.

05:45.444 --> 05:49.438
Nasedds an alien.
Nasedo has killed.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.911
Andjudging from the way I felt
when I was with Tess...

05:54.987 --> 05:57.854
<i>it definitely has
some kind of power over us.</i>

05:57.923 --> 06:00.085
Yeah, I felt it too.

06:00.159 --> 06:04.027
Like I was drawn to her for some
specific reason, like I had to let her in.

06:04.096 --> 06:06.622
- Isabel, you have to fight it.
- You too, Michael.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.101
- You just wanna deny who we really are?
- I want us to stay who we are.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.035
<i>D011'! you?</i>

06:12.104 --> 06:15.734
<i>I'm the one least involved,
the one she won't suspect.</i>

06:15.808 --> 06:18.937
- I'll get close to her.
- No. Stay away from her, Alex.

06:19.011 --> 06:23.005
Besides, we don't even know
if Nasedo is Tess anymore.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.744
It could be anyone
at any time.

06:32.124 --> 06:36.027
<i>We can only trust each other.
Now more than ever.</i>

06:37.963 --> 06:40.898
We can't just sit around and wait
for her to do something to us.

06:40.966 --> 06:43.901
Max and Michael and I will find out
all we can about her.

06:43.969 --> 06:46.097
We won't give her
the chance to surprise us.

06:46.171 --> 06:49.004
Please, Alex, I don't want
anything bad to happen to you.

06:54.513 --> 06:57.210
Wait. What are you guys
gonna do?

06:57.282 --> 07:00.343
We're gonna keep following her,
hope she reveals more to us...

07:00.419 --> 07:02.615
before she finds out
we're on to her.

07:02.688 --> 07:04.733
We've still got the camera
in her house, remember?

07:04.757 --> 07:05.656
We've still got the camera
in her house, remember?

07:05.724 --> 07:09.627
<i>[ Ed] But who?
Who would plant this in my house?</i>

07:09.695 --> 07:11.925
- You sayyou're new in town?
- That'; right.

07:11.997 --> 07:14.694
- House have any previous occupants?
- Brand-spanking-new, Sheriff.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.828
You mind if I ask what line
ofworkyouTe in, Mr. Harding?

07:17.903 --> 07:21.032
Government consultant.
The boring stuff.

07:21.106 --> 07:22.733
Facilities management,
that kind of thing.

07:22.808 --> 07:25.436
No special clearances,
no matters of national security...

07:25.511 --> 07:27.445
if that's what you're thinking.

07:27.513 --> 07:30.210
You ever have any contact
with the F.B.l.?

07:30.282 --> 07:33.081
What? Oh, Lord, no, Sheriff.

07:33.152 --> 07:36.952
I'm just a guy who's trying to do hisjob
and get along in a new town.

07:37.022 --> 07:40.458
Nobody's been in that house but me,
my daughter and the movers.

07:40.526 --> 07:43.985
Oh, and a couple
of her friends from school.

07:45.864 --> 07:49.892
I have heard some stories about
unscrupulous moving companies in town-

07:49.968 --> 07:53.427
staking out your place for future
robberies, that sort of thing.

07:53.505 --> 07:57.442
I'll tell you what. You leave your
information with my deputy outside.

07:57.509 --> 08:00.274
I promise I'll get
to the bottom of this.

08:00.345 --> 08:04.009
Well, thank you, Sheriff.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.643
I feel safe in your hands.

08:32.510 --> 08:37.312
Hi. I'm on the Sunshine Committee this year,
and we were wondering ifwe-

08:37.381 --> 08:39.407
- The what?
- The Sunshine Committee.

08:39.485 --> 08:42.419
You know, kind of like
the welcome wagon for new students.

08:42.488 --> 08:44.980
Helps them get along
and fit into a new place.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.992
I've been here eight years.
I've never heard of a Sunshine Committee.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.994
I know.
Isn't that terrible?

08:50.062 --> 08:52.497
A few of us thought
it was time to start one up.

08:52.564 --> 08:54.999
You can never have too much
sunshine, don't you think?

08:55.067 --> 08:58.059
Anyway, there's a new student
that just started here-

08:58.137 --> 09:00.572
Tess Harding.
She's our first project.

09:00.639 --> 09:03.574
Sol thought maybe I could get
some information about her from you--

09:03.642 --> 09:06.304
her class schedule,
something from her last school...

09:06.378 --> 09:09.780
anything personal that might help us
make her feel more at home.

09:09.848 --> 09:13.250
Well, I'll have to get permission
from the vice principal.

09:13.318 --> 09:15.446
Right. Okay.

09:18.524 --> 09:21.323
<i>[ Chattering]</i>

09:29.768 --> 09:33.727

Science lab third period...

09:43.916 --> 09:46.942
hallway between fourth and fifth
and Gilley Field during P.E.

09:47.019 --> 09:50.216
- I think that's all. - And there was no
other contact? She didn't even look at you?

09:50.289 --> 09:52.223
- <i>Nothing.</i>
- <i>She'; playing hard t0 get.</i>

09:52.291 --> 09:56.023
It's a classic move. She ignores you,
thinking it's gonna make you go to her.

09:56.094 --> 09:59.257
- Well, are you still drawn to her, Max?
- No.

09:59.331 --> 10:04.235
<i>Hmm. Which only further necessitates
the implementation of m y plan.</i>

10:04.303 --> 10:06.237
Wait. What plan?

10:06.305 --> 10:09.366
Oh, “Operation Never Leave
Max Alone For An Instant.“

10:09.441 --> 10:12.775
That way, one of us is always around
in case she works the voodoo on you again.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.007
I don't need a babysitter.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.515
You're right. You need
a bodyguard at all times.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.018
- [ Bell Dings]
- I don't cook for myself, you know.

10:20.085 --> 10:22.611
You know, Max,
Maria's right.

10:22.688 --> 10:25.851
We don't know what she'll do to you
if she ever gets you alone.

10:27.993 --> 10:30.087
I told you.
You don't have to worry.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.096
I know.

10:32.164 --> 10:35.361
Max, I'm not saying any
of this because I'm jealous.

10:36.869 --> 10:41.898
It's just that...
she's an alien, Max.

10:43.108 --> 10:45.042
So am I.

10:46.111 --> 10:48.045
Yeah, but what if she's-

10:48.113 --> 10:51.640
The bad kind?
One of the monsters...

10:51.717 --> 10:54.550

since the crash?

10:56.288 --> 10:58.484

how much I get to know you...

That's why

<i>So go change. We'll go back to the garage
and watch her on the monitor.</i>

11:17.676 --> 11:20.236
<i>Isrft that against

11:20.312 --> 11:23.839
<i>I wish you'd stop doing that...</i>

11:23.916 --> 11:25.941

<i>and the next thing you know I was telling

- Oh, the road trip to Florida.

12:38.056 --> 12:42.584

Really. I, uh-

- Bye.

So, I didn't really
see you in school today.

13:31.109 --> 13:34.272
I know. I saw you at the administration
office, but I didn't have time to say hello.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.280
Oh, God.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.215
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to make you nervous.

13:39.284 --> 13:42.345
You don't.
You don't make me nervous.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.482
I just want to be completely honest
with you, Isabel.

13:45.557 --> 13:48.254
I feel a closeness
to you, you know...

13:48.326 --> 13:51.728
like we share
something special...

13:51.797 --> 13:55.028
and that's why I want
you to know the truth.

But don't you ever get
signals from someone, Isabel?

14:16.655 --> 14:20.558
- Signals?
- Moments when you connect with someone...

14:20.625 --> 14:23.720
and there's no mistaking
what's going on?

14:23.795 --> 14:27.857
Like, no matter who you may be
with or what you may think...

14:27.933 --> 14:32.063
that you and this other person
are destined to be together?

14:35.841 --> 14:39.869

30:22.285 --> 30:24.720
<i>No one's sure enough
about us. Not even Nasedo.</i>

30:24.788 --> 30:27.052
The risk of exposure's
too great.

30:28.825 --> 30:32.125
- Okay, you go left. I'll go right.
- Wait, Liz.

30:32.195 --> 30:34.996
Max, you're the one
she's after, remember?

30:34.997 --> 30:35.020
Max, you're the one
she's after, remember?

30:41.536 --> 30:43.504
Here we go.

30:43.572 --> 30:47.975
“Ancient languages.“ What's this
have to do with our English assignment?

30:48.043 --> 30:51.172
- Absolutely nothing.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

30:51.246 --> 30:54.272
There's just this one book
I need for my history class.

30:54.349 --> 30:58.081
Well, what do you say we start speaking
the most ancient language known to man?

30:58.153 --> 31:00.747
I think it's on the top shelf.

31:00.822 --> 31:03.120
Would you mind helping me up?

31:06.995 --> 31:10.590
[indistinct]

31:16.338 --> 31:18.534
I've almost got it.

31:40.228 --> 31:42.219
So what language is this?

31:42.297 --> 31:45.232
<i>[ Tess ]
It's a lost language.</i>

31:45.300 --> 31:47.632
Then no one will mind
if we don't find it.

31:47.702 --> 31:50.296
Time to go.

31:50.372 --> 31:53.205
<i>But, but we just got here.</i>

31:54.776 --> 31:58.235
- What is it, Max?
- Something about us.

31:58.313 --> 32:02.477
She wanted me to see it.
That's why she brought us here.

32:03.985 --> 32:06.283
- Pohlman Ranch.
- What?

32:06.354 --> 32:09.085
The four square symbol
on the map. That's where it is.

32:09.157 --> 32:13.424
- I've never even heard of it. - That's
because the government took it over in 1947.

32:13.495 --> 32:16.362
- <i>Three guesses why</i>
- <i>Close to the</i> crash <i>site?</i>

32:16.431 --> 32:18.490
It was the crash site,
Maxwell.

32:18.567 --> 32:22.595
<i>But it's not on any maps anymore.
It's like they erased any trace of it.</i>

32:22.671 --> 32:25.402
But I could find it.
The cave painting'll lead us right to it.

32:25.474 --> 32:28.569
And you just figured this out
all by yourself?

32:28.643 --> 32:31.237
Yeah.

32:31.313 --> 32:34.908
<i>Michael, ifNasedo is doing anything
to you, you can't trust it.</i>

32:34.983 --> 32:37.350
Hey, I remembered it, okay?
I had a flash.

32:37.419 --> 32:41.117
You're not the only one who gets 'em.
So what happened at the library?

32:41.189 --> 32:44.284
- Nothing.
- What, shejust took Kyle there for no reason?

32:44.359 --> 32:47.021
I said nothing happened!

32:47.095 --> 32:51.191
We'll talk to Isabel in the morning.
You better spend the night here again.

33:20.495 --> 33:23.863
[Gasps, Panting]

33:35.377 --> 33:38.005
<i>[ Crickets Chirping]</i>

33:40.315 --> 33:43.182
You've seen them too,
haven't you?

33:43.251 --> 33:45.276
The dreams.

33:45.353 --> 33:48.755
The rock formation,
the symbol.

33:48.823 --> 33:50.757
The two of us.

33:50.825 --> 33:53.021
The baby.

33:56.331 --> 33:58.823
I think it's all true,
Michael.

34:00.135 --> 34:03.070
I think I'm pregnant
with your child.

34:04.639 --> 34:06.835
How could this be?

34:06.908 --> 34:11.402
Something weird like this
had to happen sooner or later.

34:11.478 --> 34:15.109
No matter what Max
wants to think-

34:16.784 --> 34:18.879
we're not human, Isabel.

34:20.589 --> 34:24.321
Oh, my God, Michael.
What are we gonna do?

35:03.331 --> 35:07.893
It's time.
You understand, don't you?

35:07.969 --> 35:12.770
Tell me.
Tell me what I'm feeling.

35:12.841 --> 35:16.937
I'll show you everything.
Then you'll remember.

36:07.996 --> 36:10.590
<i>[ Max]
This is it.</i>

36:10.665 --> 36:13.396
This is what Michael saw
in his hallucination.

36:13.468 --> 36:17.371
We've all seen it.
We've all been here before.

36:22.877 --> 36:25.141
What do you mean “we“?

36:27.515 --> 36:31.247
Hold me, Max.
You'll remember.

36:33.555 --> 36:35.387
[Grunts]

36:35.457 --> 36:39.087
I rememberyodre a killer,
starting from 1959.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.595
- What?
- William Atherton.

36:41.663 --> 36:43.825
The one who wrote
the alien book.

36:43.898 --> 36:45.491
It was about you,
wasn't it?

36:45.567 --> 36:48.832
He threatened to expose you,
so you killed him, right?

36:48.903 --> 36:51.702
- What are you talking about?
- Then who was next?

36:51.773 --> 36:56.301
Everett Hubble's wife? An innocent woman
died just because she got in your way!

36:56.378 --> 36:58.312
I've never killed anyone.

36:58.380 --> 37:01.406
What about the other handprint pictures
Valenti told us about?

37:01.483 --> 37:03.975
And how many other victims
will there be after tonight?

37:04.052 --> 37:07.249
Alex? Maria? Liz?

37:07.322 --> 37:09.450
Nobody has to get hurt, Max.

37:09.524 --> 37:12.255
Sure, until you get
what you want!

37:12.327 --> 37:15.763
It's not just what I want.
It's what's meant to be.

37:15.830 --> 37:19.323
It's all in here, Max.
It's our destiny.

37:20.769 --> 37:23.864
No! I am not like you!

37:23.938 --> 37:27.033
I live in this world.
It's all I know.

37:27.108 --> 37:30.874
And I will not be a part
of anything as evil as you.

37:30.945 --> 37:33.312
Is that what you think I am?

37:33.381 --> 37:36.078
- [ Gasps]
- Show me who you really are.

37:36.151 --> 37:39.951
- Don't hide behind this face.
- I'm not hiding, Max.

37:40.021 --> 37:42.353
I said show me!

37:42.424 --> 37:46.861
Shape-shift! Show me
what you really look like!

37:46.928 --> 37:49.260
What I really look like!

37:49.330 --> 37:52.493
Oh, God, Max.
That's not who I am.

37:52.567 --> 37:55.059
That's not who I am!

37:57.872 --> 38:00.432
Think, Max.

38:00.508 --> 38:03.239
You've seen my face before.

38:03.311 --> 38:06.747
[Sobbing]
You know who I am.

40:38.866 --> 40:42.029
You know who I am now,
don't you?

40:42.103 --> 40:46.165
- <i>You understand our destiny.</i>
- <i>[ Vehicle Approaching]</i>

40:46.240 --> 40:49.107
Hey, what the hell did you do
to him?To all ofus!

40:49.177 --> 40:51.874
Michael, stop it.
She's not Nasedo.

40:51.946 --> 40:54.540
Then who is she, Max?

40:58.319 --> 41:00.253
She's one of us.
