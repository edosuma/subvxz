making this horrible sound.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.833
Dean Arnold fired me...

18:40.833 --> 18:42.300
in the classroom...

18:42.300 --> 18:45.633
because of sexual
harassment with a minor.

18:49.833 --> 18:51.433
That's disgusting.

18:51.433 --> 18:54.800
You just stuck your
hand into a pile of shit.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.200
What's the word, little turd?

18:57.200 --> 19:01.333
Too soon. JK. Simmons.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.233
Hey, where'd you go?
You ghosted so hard.

19:04.233 --> 19:08.067
Oh, right, yeah... I went back
to run the family business...

19:08.067 --> 19:09.400
the Oreo factory.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.200
My brother Beau and I, we never
really got along...

19:12.200 --> 19:14.167
and so we decided to
split the business--

19:14.167 --> 19:17.300
Oh, I can't get into the whole
story right now.

19:17.300 --> 19:20.100
I just shit a giant key
out of my butthole.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.567
But maybe later.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.100
All right, I'll let you rest.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.567
Oh, could we have a minute?
Just for a second.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.933
Why is he mean-mugging me?

19:32.933 --> 19:35.300
Did you do something shitty?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.133
Good one.
Thanks.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.700
Hey, do you still have your job?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.733
Yeah, he fired Bea.

19:40.733 --> 19:43.567
Bea? Doesn't sound familiar.

19:43.567 --> 19:46.100
The British woman, we've been
hanging out with her all night.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.133
No... no clue.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.600
Are you feeling okay?

19:49.600 --> 19:54.233
Yeah, I wasn't... and then,
short story, I was.

19:54.233 --> 19:56.700
Feeling good, because they
gave me a-drugs.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.533
A-drugs?
And I didn't just have one.

19:58.533 --> 20:00.733
I had-- I had a family of them.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.367
Hey! Everyone had a really
good time, Gene.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.733
Liar.

20:05.733 --> 20:08.133
I love you, Gene.
I love you, too, Miss Charlotte.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.433
Really, I don't like that name.
Why?

20:10.433 --> 20:12.933
It's a stupid name
for stupid people.

20:12.933 --> 20:16.067
Yeah, you're right, only bitches
are named...

20:16.067 --> 20:19.167
Charlotte.
Charlotte.

20:19.167 --> 20:22.267
( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )

20:28.667 --> 20:30.633
Ugh... come on, guys.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.233
Litter bugs, god dang it.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.633
Oh--

20:37.633 --> 20:39.867
What are you doing? I was
throwing that in the trash.

20:39.867 --> 20:41.667
Oh.
There's a maggot in it.

20:41.667 --> 20:42.933
Oh.
Okay.

20:42.933 --> 20:44.700
Thought it was an apple
for the teacher.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.633
See-- see you next... yeah.

20:59.767 --> 21:01.567
See ya next year, Gene.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.133
Helen Hunt?

21:05.733 --> 21:07.633
[BILLIE] Take a... train!
[GENE] Train!

21:12.900 --> 21:14.800
Can you hear it?
Yeah, I hear it.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.067
It's kind of like...
gahng-gah-gangha-gahng!

21:18.067 --> 21:19.433
Gahng-gahng-gahng-gahng-
gangh-gangh!

21:19.433 --> 21:22.233
Mm-hm, mm-hm, dang-dah-dang
dang-dang-dang!

21:22.233 --> 21:24.067
Dang-dang-dang-dang-dang!

21:24.067 --> 21:25.567
Gahng-gah-gahng-gahng-gahng!

21:25.567 --> 21:27.500
Psyche, I can't hear it,
