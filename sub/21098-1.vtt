00:28.328 --> 00:30.563
- Worldwide, we're 
looking at approximately

00:30.563 --> 00:33.833
350 million people 
with diabetes.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.002
There's not question 
that we're in the midst

00:36.002 --> 00:38.104
of a diabetes epidemic.

00:38.104 --> 00:41.307
Right now, one in 
three Medicare dollars

00:41.307 --> 00:44.444
is spent in the care of 
people with diabetes.

00:44.444 --> 00:47.347
One in 10 total 
health care dollars

00:47.347 --> 00:50.216
is spent on people 
with diabetes.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.920
There's no question that 
this is a major problem.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.155
- [Kip] What in particular

00:55.155 --> 00:58.425
is the relation of 
the diet and diabetes?

00:58.425 --> 01:00.326
- I'm not gonna get into that.

01:00.326 --> 01:01.094
- [Kip] Into diet?

01:01.094 --> 01:02.495
- No.

01:02.495 --> 01:06.566
(uplifting Mexican guitar music)

01:24.350 --> 01:26.519
- [Kip] My name is Kip, I'm a 
filmmaker from San Francisco

01:26.519 --> 01:28.121
and I have a confession to make.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.989
I'm a recovering hypochondriac.

01:29.989 --> 01:32.859
Like so many of us, I've a 
family history of diabetes,

01:32.859 --> 01:34.894
heart disease, and cancer.

01:34.894 --> 01:37.130
My dad had his 
heart bypass at 49,

01:37.130 --> 01:38.865
the second at the age 50.

01:38.865 --> 01:41.334
My grandpa died young from 
diabetes complications

01:41.334 --> 01:44.704
and both my other grandpa 
and grandma died of cancer.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.439
I was always paranoid 
that I would also get

01:46.439 --> 01:47.974
one of these diseases.

01:47.974 --> 01:50.810
Like any good hypochondriac, 
WebMD Symptoms Checker

01:50.810 --> 01:53.146
was essentially my 
browser's homepage.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.348
Even in my teens, I 
took Metamucil everyday

01:55.348 --> 01:56.783
and a daily aspirin.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.785
I read all the latest 
self-diagnosis books.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.120
I ate every multivitamin 
I can get my hands on

02:01.120 --> 02:03.523
and I was obsessed 
with bodily functions.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.525
I followed all the large 
health organization's

02:05.525 --> 02:07.927
recommendations for 
preventing disease.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.997
I exercise regularly, don't 
smoke, don't drink soda,

02:10.997 --> 02:12.999
get enough sleep, reduce stress,

02:12.999 --> 02:14.300
and grew up eating 
what I thought

02:14.300 --> 02:16.703
was a healthy diet, until--

02:16.703 --> 02:18.171
- World Health 
Organization this morning

02:18.171 --> 02:21.407
has classified processed meats 
such as bacon and sausage

02:21.407 --> 02:23.877
as carcinogenic, 
directly involved

02:23.877 --> 02:26.412
in causing cancer in humans.

02:26.412 --> 02:29.115
- [Announcer] Processed 
meat is clearly linked

02:29.115 --> 02:30.483
to an increase in cancer.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.085
- Hotdogs or bacon could be just

02:32.085 --> 02:34.754
as dangerous as 
smoking cigarettes.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.422
- [Kip] The World Health 
Organization that looked

02:36.422 --> 02:39.726
over 800 studies from 
10 different countries

02:39.726 --> 02:43.296
finding a direct link 
to consuming processed 
meat in cancer.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.832
Just one serving of deli 
meats daily increases

02:45.832 --> 02:49.969
your risks of colorectal 
cancer by 18%.

02:49.969 --> 02:53.139
I had no idea that what we 
ate affected cancer rates,

02:53.139 --> 02:55.542
but I never felt like I'd 
eaten a lot of processed meats

02:55.542 --> 02:57.544
until I realized 
that processed meat

02:57.544 --> 02:59.746
includes hotdogs, 
bacon, sausage,

02:59.746 --> 03:03.216
salami, ham, pepperoni, 
cold cuts, and Deli Slices,

03:03.216 --> 03:05.552
basically, everything 
I grew up eating.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.820
The World Health Organization 
classifies processed meat

03:07.820 --> 03:10.323
as a Group 1 carcinogen.

03:10.323 --> 03:14.894
The same group as cigarettes, 
asbestos, and plutonium.

03:14.894 --> 03:18.064
And classifies red meat 
as a Group 2 carcinogen.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.866
Was this like I'd 
essentially been smoking

03:19.866 --> 03:21.534
my entire childhood?

03:22.902 --> 03:25.071
If processed meats are labeled 
the same as cigarettes,

03:25.071 --> 03:28.675
how is even legal for kids 
to be eating this way?

03:28.675 --> 03:30.610
I thought this was 
new information

03:30.610 --> 03:35.148
but many of these studies 
had been around for 50 years.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.417
I couldn't believe I'd 
been eating processed meats

03:37.417 --> 03:40.420
virtually my entire 
life and was just now,

03:40.420 --> 03:43.089
finding out how 
dangerous they are.

03:43.089 --> 03:44.324
Why hadn't I been 
hearing about it

03:44.324 --> 03:46.092
from the American 
Cancer Society,

03:46.092 --> 03:48.628
the largest cancer 
group in the nation?

03:48.628 --> 03:50.163
When I went on their website,

03:50.163 --> 03:51.898
I was shocked to see that 
none of these information

03:51.898 --> 03:53.766
was featured on their homepage.

03:53.766 --> 03:57.103
But even more shocking, 
on their Eat Healthy page,

03:57.103 --> 04:00.873
they actually encouraged eating 
Group 1 carcinogenic foods

04:00.873 --> 04:03.009
like processed turkey 
and canned meats.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.078
This is after the World 
Health Organization

04:05.078 --> 04:08.081
reviewed over 800 
studies definitively

04:08.081 --> 04:10.183
linking processed 
meat to cancer.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.218
- [Sam] Thank you for calling, 
American Cancer Society.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.954
My name is Sam, I'm a cancer 
information specialist.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.356
How may I help you today?

04:16.356 --> 04:17.757
- Hi, I was calling 
because I was wondering why

04:17.757 --> 04:18.925
you all recommend people

04:18.925 --> 04:22.362
to eat processed 
meat on your website?

04:22.362 --> 04:24.230
Which the World Health 
Organization has classified

04:24.230 --> 04:26.232
as a Group 1 carcinogen?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.569
Which is in the same 
class as tobacco smoking,

04:29.569 --> 04:31.571
asbestos, and plutonium?

04:33.473 --> 04:35.942
This would be like a 
lung association having a

04:35.942 --> 04:39.579
How to Roll your own Cigarettes 
section on their website.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.948
It's kinda the same thing?

04:41.948 --> 04:42.882
- [Sam] Well, let 
me just place you

04:42.882 --> 04:45.151
on a brief hold because--

04:45.151 --> 04:46.786
- He wasn't able to 
answer my questions

04:46.786 --> 04:49.389
and said someone would 
get back with me.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.990
I had always been 
concerned about cancer

04:50.990 --> 04:54.460
because both my grandma 
and grandpa died of cancer.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.928
I wondered if things 
would have been different

04:55.928 --> 04:57.597
had they known the 
link between diet

04:57.597 --> 04:59.298
and this terrible disease.

04:59.298 --> 05:03.403
In the US, one out of every 
four deaths is from cancer.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.072
Oh sweet, American 
Cancer Society rep

05:06.072 --> 05:08.908
confirmed the 
interview this week.

05:10.677 --> 05:11.944
So, we just went in 
for the interview

05:11.944 --> 05:13.880
with the American 
Cancer Society rep

05:13.880 --> 05:15.281
and the security guard said,

05:15.281 --> 05:17.283
"There's no 
interview scheduled."

05:17.283 --> 05:20.186
So I went on to my phone 
and it turns out last night,

05:20.186 --> 05:21.921
after I'd told her that 
the interview's gonna be

05:21.921 --> 05:24.924
about the correlation 
between diet and cancer,

05:24.924 --> 05:28.594
she said she can no 
longer do the interview.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.297
After repeated emails asking why

05:31.297 --> 05:33.099
she was declining my interviews

05:33.099 --> 05:35.568
to simply talk about 
diet and cancer,

05:35.568 --> 05:38.371
she stopped responding 
all together.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.873
Why would an American 
Cancer Society rep

05:40.873 --> 05:43.409
not wanna talk about this?

05:43.409 --> 05:45.478
I was, however, able to 
connect with a growing movement

05:45.478 --> 05:47.580
of doctors who are willing 
to talk about the link

05:47.580 --> 05:49.816
between the standard 
American diet and disease,

05:49.816 --> 05:51.984
and it goes beyond just cancer.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.953
I took my old trustee 
van, Super Blue,

05:53.953 --> 05:56.089
once again out on the road.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.424
- 2/3 of adults are now 
overweight or obese,

05:58.424 --> 06:01.427
and we have an epidemic 
cascade of debilitating disease

06:01.427 --> 06:02.962
that's overcoming the country.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.698
There's no way we can 
sustain the current style

06:05.698 --> 06:09.102
of care with the epidemic 
that we're creating

06:09.102 --> 06:10.970
with our diet and 
lifestyle choices.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.573
- The diabetes, the 
arthritis, the heart disease,

06:13.573 --> 06:16.375
the dementia, the 
obesity, the cancers

06:16.375 --> 06:18.978
are affecting about 
70% of deaths.

06:18.978 --> 06:22.949
All the data is that those 
70% of deaths and morbidity

06:22.949 --> 06:25.685
are largely lifestyle-related 
and preventable.

06:25.685 --> 06:30.389
- Most kids by age 10 in the 
US already have fatty streaks

06:30.389 --> 06:32.825
in their arteries the first 
stage of atherosclerosis

06:32.825 --> 06:35.361
leading to heart 
attacks, strokes.

06:35.361 --> 06:36.596
- Here in American medicine,

06:36.596 --> 06:39.031
we operate from 
the disease model.

06:39.031 --> 06:42.201
We are in the business 
of treating sick people.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.270
We are not in the 
business of trying

06:44.270 --> 06:46.105
to prevent people 
from becoming sick.

06:46.105 --> 06:48.074
- When you look at 
chronic disease risk,

06:48.074 --> 06:50.009
all the things that we 
walk around worrying about.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.246
Actually, dietary 
choices trump smoking

06:53.246 --> 06:54.914
when it comes to those risks.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.817
- If I could deliver one 
message to the researchers

06:57.817 --> 07:00.319
who are looking for 
the cause of diabetes

07:00.319 --> 07:01.988
and the cause of 
clogged arteries,

07:01.988 --> 07:03.723
and the cause of 
high blood pressure,

07:03.723 --> 07:06.125
and the cause of obesity, 
I would tell them,

07:06.125 --> 07:09.428
the answer's in three words, 
it's the food. (laughs)

07:09.428 --> 07:11.464
It's what Americans are eating.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.966
- [Kip] Today, with 2/3 of 
Americans being overweight,

07:13.966 --> 07:16.602
clearly, there's a food issue.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.004
In the next 25 years,

07:18.004 --> 07:21.607
one out of every three 
Americans will have diabetes.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.509
- My name's Michael Abdalla.

07:23.509 --> 07:26.746
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia, 
and unfortunately,

07:26.746 --> 07:29.949
I was diagnosed about 10 
years ago with diabetes,

07:29.949 --> 07:33.319
and eight years ago, I 
had two stents put in.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.588
I don't know where to 
go, I don't know what do,

07:35.588 --> 07:38.391
you just like add the options 
and you don't know what to do.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.426
You take in medicine, you 
listen to this doctor,

07:40.426 --> 07:42.995
and the cardiologist 
says, "Take this,"

07:42.995 --> 07:46.299
and the endocrinologist 
says, "Take that,"

07:46.299 --> 07:48.367
then your general 
practitioner doctor says,

07:48.367 --> 07:49.969
"You don't know 
what's going on here."

07:49.969 --> 07:52.371
It's a real challenging thing

07:53.506 --> 07:57.443
and it's something that 
you don't wanna get.

07:57.443 --> 07:58.911
You just don't wanna get it.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.080
- [Kip] Government and media 
almost exclusively blame

08:01.080 --> 08:04.884
lack of exercise and sugary 
foods as a cause of diabetes.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.552
But I wanted to talk 
with an actual expert

08:06.552 --> 08:08.688
on the role of diet in diabetes.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.056
I went to speak with 
premier physician,

08:10.056 --> 08:13.793
diabetes expert, and 
researcher, Dr. Neal Barnard.

08:13.793 --> 08:17.396
What role does sugar 
play in causing diabetes?

08:17.396 --> 08:18.598
- Drive me crazy.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.000
Diabetes is not and 
never was caused

08:21.000 --> 08:23.836
by eating a high 
carbohydrate diet

08:23.836 --> 08:25.371
and it's not caused 
by eating sugar.

08:25.371 --> 08:27.306
The cause of diabetes is a diet

08:27.306 --> 08:29.876
that builds up the amount 
of fat into the blood.

08:29.876 --> 08:33.145
I'm talking about a typical 
meat-based, animal-based diet.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.581
You can look into the muscle 
cells of the human body

08:35.581 --> 08:38.083
and you find they're building 
up tiny particles of fat

08:38.083 --> 08:40.385
which is causing 
insulin resistance.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.221
What that means is the sugar

08:42.221 --> 08:44.457
that is naturally from the 
foods that you're eating

08:44.457 --> 08:46.525
can't get into the 
cells where it belongs.

08:46.525 --> 08:49.095
It builds up in the blood 
and that's diabetes.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.329
- [Kip] I had never 
heard that meat

08:50.329 --> 08:52.164
was associated with 
causing diabetes.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.934
We had always been told that 
sugar and obesity caused it.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.402
Renowned weight loss 
bariatric surgeon,

08:56.402 --> 08:58.538
Dr. Garth Davis, though agreed.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.439
- Everyone thinks that you 
diabetic because of carbs,

09:00.439 --> 09:03.676
did a huge study and that 
epic study, 500,000 people.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.512
Carbs consumption was 
inversely related to diabetes.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.481
In other words, the more 
carbs they wanna to eat,

09:08.481 --> 09:12.351
the less diabetes they had but 
meat was strongly correlated.

09:12.351 --> 09:13.619
Get that aha moment.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.855
The starches, the 
carbs are good for you.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.323
They're not bad for you.

09:17.323 --> 09:20.459
This idea that carbs make you 
fat is utterly ridiculous.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.629
Carbs cannot make you 
fat in and of themselves.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.065
We have storage in our muscles

09:26.065 --> 09:28.301
and in our liver for 
carbs called glycogen.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.137
So, when we eat carbs, we 
either store it or we burn it.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.606
Now, eat fat that goes 
straight to you fat.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.375
Your body can't turn 
those carbs into fat

09:36.375 --> 09:38.577
unless you're really 
overdoing your calories.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.313
Basically, it's 
a death sentence.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.248
You're at much higher 
risk of getting cancer.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.483
You're almost certainly 
gonna get diabetes.

09:44.483 --> 09:45.985
No one wants to fat shame

09:45.985 --> 09:47.753
and we all want everybody to 
be comfortable with our bodies

09:47.753 --> 09:49.422
but this movement to be 
comfortable with our bodies

09:49.422 --> 09:51.324
has made us comfortable 
with being sick

09:51.324 --> 09:52.892
and that's a huge problem.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.627
I go into the hospital 
and I look around me,

09:54.627 --> 09:56.963
people on dialysis, 
all these sick people

09:56.963 --> 09:58.631
and just about every 
disease in there

09:58.631 --> 10:00.433
is because of what 
people are eating.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.669
- Here's the thing, if 
I eat a sugary cookie,

10:03.669 --> 10:06.038
the sugar lures you in 
like the Trojan Horse

10:06.038 --> 10:07.873
but waiting inside that cookie

10:07.873 --> 10:10.476
is a huge load of 
butter or shortening

10:10.476 --> 10:11.711
and that's what fattens you up.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.679
That's the part that 
leads to the diabetes.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.848
It's the fatty foods, not 
really so much the sugar.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.350
- It's not that 
sugar's good for you.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.652
There's no nutrients in 
it, it's excess calories,

10:19.652 --> 10:20.786
but when you eat sugar,

10:20.786 --> 10:22.655
you don't get 
inflammation right away.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.623
When you eat sugar, 
you're not getting plaques

10:24.623 --> 10:26.125
forming in your vessels.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.027
When you're eating sugar, 
your body's gonna store

10:28.027 --> 10:31.697
most of it as glycogen 
or burn it as calories.

10:31.697 --> 10:35.568
So, this focus on sugar 
has taken all the focus off

10:35.568 --> 10:39.772
meat, dairy, eggs, 
pork, turkey, chicken.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.574
- People need to understand.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.476
If their gets diabetes,

10:43.476 --> 10:46.912
you've just take 19 years 
off their life span.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.948
We're talking life and death.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.416
- I realized, there 
was so much more

10:50.416 --> 10:52.852
about diet and disease 
that I hadn't ever learned.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.286
It felt as if this information

10:54.286 --> 10:56.022
had been practically withheld.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.857
Processed meat causes cancer.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.259
Sugar doesn't cause diabetes.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.428
I had doubt about the claims 
these doctors are making

11:02.428 --> 11:04.764
so I did some 
searching on my own.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.899
Harvard researchers looked 
at nine perspective studies

11:06.899 --> 11:09.668
finding that just one serving 
of processed meat per day

11:09.668 --> 11:13.839
increased risk of 
developing diabetes by 51%.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.074
The link between eating meat

11:15.074 --> 11:17.977
and developing diabetes 
became undeniable.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.178
But when I went on

11:19.178 --> 11:20.946
the leading diabetes 
organization's website,

11:20.946 --> 11:22.915
the American 
Diabetes Association,

11:22.915 --> 11:24.583
not only did they not 
have this information

11:24.583 --> 11:27.386
front and center, they 
were featuring recipes

11:27.386 --> 11:30.056
for red and processed 
meat and on there,

11:30.056 --> 11:31.991
Recipes for Healthy Living.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.193
They had bacon wrapped shrimp?

11:34.193 --> 11:36.328
What the health?

11:36.328 --> 11:38.564
All right, send an email to 
American Diabetes Association,

11:38.564 --> 11:40.633
see if they get back to us.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.401
As destructive as diabetes is,

11:42.401 --> 11:44.336
it pales in comparison 
to heart disease.

11:44.336 --> 11:47.139
Over 17 million 
people die every year

11:47.139 --> 11:49.141
from cardiovascular disease.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.644
It is the leading cause 
of death around the world.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.146
Nearly, one out of 
every three people

11:54.146 --> 11:56.115
will die from this disease.

11:56.115 --> 11:58.584
The amount of people who die 
from cardiovascular disease

11:58.584 --> 12:01.020
is the equivalent 
of four jumbo jets

12:01.020 --> 12:03.222
crashing every single hour

12:03.222 --> 12:06.225
every single day, 
every single year.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.064
- My name is Amy Resnic,

12:12.064 --> 12:14.333
and I'm from Swampscott, 
Massachusetts,

12:14.333 --> 12:16.102
little bit north of Boston.

12:16.102 --> 12:19.772
And I recently went to 
my doctor for asthma

12:19.772 --> 12:21.907
because I had a very 
hard time breathing

12:21.907 --> 12:24.810
and while there, she 
did some blood work

12:24.810 --> 12:28.414
and one of the tests 
was C-reactive protein

12:31.684 --> 12:33.986
and that was a scale 
of one to three.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.188
One being low for cardiac event,

12:36.188 --> 12:38.190
three being high 
for a cardiac event,

12:38.190 --> 12:40.192
and my number was 10.82.

12:41.627 --> 12:42.862
- What does that means.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.164
- That means I am on the 
road for heart attack

12:45.164 --> 12:48.467
and she said, "Probably, 
within the next 30 days."

12:48.467 --> 12:50.302
- 30 days? 
- 30 days,

12:50.302 --> 12:52.404
if I'm going the 
way I was going.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.407
I take this for my 
heart arrhythmia,

12:57.109 --> 13:00.346
take this for pain, 
oxycodone for pain,

13:01.614 --> 13:03.716
and lorazepam for stress,

13:05.284 --> 13:07.853
cyclobenzaprine 
for muscle relaxer.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.489
Also take Topamax and Prozac

13:10.489 --> 13:13.959
and I also use a CPAP 
machine to help me breathe,

13:13.959 --> 13:18.330
and my asthma has been 
so bad this past year.

13:18.330 --> 13:22.268
I used to turn the day 
as well to get some air.

13:22.268 --> 13:26.338
I am tired when I wake up, 
I'm tired during the day.

13:26.338 --> 13:30.609
I take a nap, I'm so 
tired, I can't breathe,

13:30.609 --> 13:34.780
and I know I need to make 
at change for my health,

13:36.448 --> 13:39.952
I also am not gonna 
be here for my family.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.388
- When we speak 
of heart disease,

13:42.388 --> 13:44.757
I would say the role of 
alcohol is pretty small.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.526
The role of sugar 
is very small too.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.461
Smoking is big, 
but the good news

13:49.461 --> 13:52.331
is that most people have 
quit or never did smoke.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.099
The problem with 
animal-based diet,

13:54.099 --> 13:56.368
it's contribution to 
heart disease is huge,

13:56.368 --> 13:57.670
and it is pervasive.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.106
- All these expensive 
imaging, procedures,

14:02.441 --> 14:04.176
bypasses, medication,

14:05.611 --> 14:09.682
none of which has one 
solitary single thing to do

14:10.883 --> 14:12.484
with the causation 
of the illness

14:12.484 --> 14:14.253
so you die with a 
completely benign,

14:14.253 --> 14:15.521
full-blown illness,

14:15.521 --> 14:17.523
that never had its 
causation treated.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.060
- When we eat these kind of 
dead meat bacteria toxins,

14:21.060 --> 14:23.362
within minutes, 
we get this burst

14:23.362 --> 14:25.598
of inflammation 
within your system

14:25.598 --> 14:27.733
such that you basically 
paralyze your arteries.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.134
So, you get this 
stiffening of the arteries,

14:29.134 --> 14:32.238
their inability to 
relax normally in half.

14:32.238 --> 14:35.140
It's not like decades down 
the road, eating unhealthy,

14:35.140 --> 14:36.408
there'll be some damage, no.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.110
We're talking damage 
right then and there

14:38.110 --> 14:40.246
within minutes of 
going into our mouth.

14:40.246 --> 14:44.617
- Many people are given the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease

14:44.617 --> 14:47.253
when it's not true 
Alzheimer's at all.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.121
The vast majority of 
people suffered dementia

14:49.121 --> 14:51.023
through that their 
tiny blood vessels

14:51.023 --> 14:54.326
in their brain clogging 
up and their nerve cells

14:54.326 --> 14:56.462
being short-changed 
of oxygenated blood

14:56.462 --> 14:58.697
and guess where their blood 
vessel eventually comes from,

14:58.697 --> 15:00.699
those little tiny 
arteries are clogging up

15:00.699 --> 15:03.602
from that steady stream of 
fat, cholesterol, et cetera.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.205
- It's really quite clear 
from the standpoint of cancer

15:06.205 --> 15:08.507
and the standpoint of 
cardiovascular disease,

15:08.507 --> 15:11.243
that animal protein 
plays an enormous role.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.912
- [Kip] Is chicken better?

15:13.912 --> 15:16.282
- It's question of whether 
you be shot or hung.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.250
- The flesh food that 
I would eliminate

15:18.250 --> 15:20.519
from the American 
diet would be poultry,

15:20.519 --> 15:22.087
would be turkey and chicken.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.989
Their brilliant 
advertising campaign

15:23.989 --> 15:25.257
has convinced people that,

15:25.257 --> 15:27.192
"Oh, it's white meat, 
it's healthier."

15:27.192 --> 15:29.528
- The leading source of sodium

15:29.528 --> 15:33.399
in the American diet 
for adult is chicken.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.000
It can be labeled 
all-natural chicken

15:35.000 --> 15:36.735
but they inject it 
with a salt water,

15:36.735 --> 15:38.904
I think, up to 800 
milligrams of sodium.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.240
- Heterocyclic amines 
are clear cut carcinogens

15:41.240 --> 15:43.609
and they can form 
in any kind of meat

15:43.609 --> 15:45.444
as it's heated, as it's cooked,

15:45.444 --> 15:48.881
but by far, the biggest 
source is chicken.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.751
We sent researchers into fast 
food and family restaurants.

15:52.751 --> 15:56.055
Not only were there carcinogens 
in every single restaurant.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.924
Well, we found them in 
every single chicken sample

15:58.924 --> 15:59.858
that we took.

15:59.858 --> 16:01.226
If somebody brings their family

16:01.226 --> 16:03.128
and then they're buying 
a bucket of chicken,

16:03.128 --> 16:04.997
nobody tells them that 
there are carcinogens.

16:04.997 --> 16:07.599
If you're selling 
carcinogens to people,

16:07.599 --> 16:09.702
you've gotta warn them 
that they're in there.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.670
- [Kip] But the American Cancer 
Society encourages people

16:11.670 --> 16:14.406
to switch from red and 
processed meat to chicken.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.342
Why would the American 
Cancer Society tell people

16:16.342 --> 16:19.178
to switch from eating one 
carcinogenic food to another

16:19.178 --> 16:20.479
when a Harvard University study

16:20.479 --> 16:22.114
showed that men 
with prostate cancer

16:22.114 --> 16:23.615
who eat large amounts of chicken

16:23.615 --> 16:27.086
increased their risk of the 
disease progressing four times?

16:27.086 --> 16:30.222
- The number one dietary source 
in America of cholesterol

16:30.222 --> 16:32.057
is chicken because 
the volume of chicken.

16:32.057 --> 16:35.194
Chickens become grilled 
chicken and organic chicken,

16:35.194 --> 16:37.863
if it's machismo, 
but it has nearly

16:37.863 --> 16:40.165
as much cholesterol 
per gram as red beef

16:40.165 --> 16:42.668
suggests that sheer volume 
is the number one source

16:42.668 --> 16:44.336
yet eggs being close by.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.205
- [Kip] I'd never really 
thought about eggs much.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.439
I just thought of them

16:47.439 --> 16:49.208
as a standard part 
of the healthy diet.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.709
But then, I found 
a study suggesting

16:50.709 --> 16:53.145
that eating just one 
egg a day can be as bad

16:53.145 --> 16:57.249
as smoking five cigarettes 
per day for life expectancy.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.619
- The yolk of a hen's egg is 
the most concentrated glom

17:00.619 --> 17:03.055
of saturated fat 
and cholesterol.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.858
It is made to run a 
baby chicken for 21 days

17:05.858 --> 17:07.726
with no outside energy.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.328
It is pure fat and cholesterol.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.964
And when we put that 
into our blood stream,

17:11.964 --> 17:13.232
it coats our red blood cells,

17:13.232 --> 17:15.634
our blood gets thicker 
and more viscous.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.136
It changes our hormone levels.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.737
It raises our 
cholesterol levels.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.839
There's nothing healthy 
about eating yolk of the egg.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.308
- [Kip] But I thought 
cholesterol and saturated fat

17:23.308 --> 17:25.477
wasn't an issue anymore?

17:25.477 --> 17:27.378
- You know, these saturated 
fat studies that have come out,

17:27.378 --> 17:29.214
trying to vindicate 
saturated fat.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.916
That's a campaign by 
the dairy industry.

17:30.916 --> 17:34.486
Number one source of saturated 
fat is dairy, it's not meat.

17:34.486 --> 17:37.222
2008, the global dairy industry 
got together at a meeting

17:37.222 --> 17:39.558
and explicitly read their agenda

17:39.558 --> 17:43.195
was to neutralize the 
negative impact of milk fat

17:43.195 --> 17:45.864
by regulators and medical 
professionals, unquote.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.533
So, what they do, 
they funded studies.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.734
- [Kip] The main 
study that started

17:48.734 --> 17:50.669
the whole saturated 
fat media craze

17:50.669 --> 17:53.372
was funded by the 
National Dairy Council.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.441
The egg industry 
similarly fund studies

17:55.441 --> 17:57.342
that confuse consumers 
by making claims

17:57.342 --> 17:59.745
that eggs don't negatively 
affect heart function.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.447
That is only when 
compared to eating

18:01.447 --> 18:04.116
a McDonald's Sausage McMuffin?

18:04.116 --> 18:05.584
So, what they're 
really saying is that

18:05.584 --> 18:08.620
eating eggs is just as 
bad as eating a McMuffin.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.923
- When you eat foods 
like beef or steak

18:10.923 --> 18:12.958
or a processed meat, a hotdog,

18:12.958 --> 18:14.326
you're not just 
getting saturated fat,

18:14.326 --> 18:17.029
you're also getting 
other additional toxins

18:17.029 --> 18:18.464
that are in that food.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.732
There's heme iron, carcinogens, 
and processing chemicals.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.601
This is all a lot 
more complicated

18:22.601 --> 18:24.770
than just looking 
at saturated fat.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.674
- The strategy is not on making 
their products any safer.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.910
The strategy is to just 
try to confuse the public

18:31.910 --> 18:33.579
to introduce doubt.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.547
You know, there was a famous 
tobacco industry memo.

18:35.547 --> 18:37.549
It's called, Doubt 
is our product.

18:37.549 --> 18:38.817
That's all they had to do.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.486
They didn't have to 
convince the Americans

18:40.486 --> 18:42.554
that smoking was healthy, right?

18:42.554 --> 18:46.225
They just had to introduce 
doubt then they would win.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.926
Well, if there's just 
enough controversy,

18:47.926 --> 18:49.461
people kinda throw 
up their hands,

18:49.461 --> 18:50.496
"I don't know what to eat."

18:50.496 --> 18:52.498
Confusion is their gain.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.767
I really don't think people 
thought what they ate

18:55.767 --> 18:57.236
led to heart disease.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.171
They think. "Oh, it's 
genetic, my parents had it."

18:59.171 --> 19:01.006
I don't think 
people really think

19:01.006 --> 19:02.541
that what they ate 
lead to diabetes.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.543
They think, "Oh, my parents 
had it, I was gonna get it."

19:04.543 --> 19:06.478
And certainly, cancer, 
they don't think that way.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.314
- People have bad lifestyles 
that they've inherited.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.916
Environmentally, 
they've been exposed

19:10.916 --> 19:12.518
to a certain way of 
eating and living

19:12.518 --> 19:14.720
they've carried on 
into their adulthood,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.255
passed on to their children.

19:16.255 --> 19:19.858
That is why they go on to 
develop the same diseases

19:19.858 --> 19:22.661
that their parents 
and grandparents may 
have had before them

19:22.661 --> 19:24.229
but it is not inevitable.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.998
- Even if you have a 
genetic predisposition,

19:25.998 --> 19:28.700
it doesn't mean it's going 
to necessarily manifest.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.435
What determines whether 
it manifests or not,

19:30.435 --> 19:32.104
maybe those 
epigenetic variables,

19:32.104 --> 19:33.539
the things that you can control.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.407
The environmental factors, 
the dietary factors,

19:35.407 --> 19:36.875
the lifestyle factors.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.444
- So, we can actually change 
the expression of genes.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.847
Tumor-suppressing genes, 
tumor activating genes

19:41.847 --> 19:45.117
by what we eat, what 
we put into our bodies.

19:45.117 --> 19:49.488
So, even if you've been 
dealt a bad genetic deck,

19:49.488 --> 19:52.424
you can still 
reshuffle it with diet.

19:52.424 --> 19:53.892
- I'd always thought

19:53.892 --> 19:55.394
that I would develop heart 
disease at a young age

19:55.394 --> 19:57.362
because both my dad and 
grandpa had heart attacks.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.164
I was taught that 
they were genetic,

19:59.164 --> 20:01.266
but the heart attacks probably 
had less to do with genes

20:01.266 --> 20:03.669
and more to do with 
their diets high in meat.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.104
That's why when I went on the 
American Heart Association's

20:06.104 --> 20:09.341
Heart-healthy Recipes 
page, I could not believe

20:09.341 --> 20:12.611
they had an entire 
section on beef recipes?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.746
This was just like the 
American Cancer Society

20:14.746 --> 20:17.916
encouraging eating Group 1 
carcinogens on their site.

20:17.916 --> 20:21.920
Meat loaf, pork loin, 
steak on your recipe list?

20:23.322 --> 20:24.856
Are you kidding me?

20:24.856 --> 20:27.326
It's like this menu's trying 
to get people heart attacks.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.461
At your website, we noticed 
heart-healthy recipes,

20:29.461 --> 20:33.632
and we're kinda bewildered by 
why there's a bunch of recipes

20:35.067 --> 20:38.870
on the whole section 
on beef, beef recipes,

20:38.870 --> 20:41.006
and there's also a 
section on egg recipes

20:41.006 --> 20:43.241
when there's such a strong link

20:43.241 --> 20:46.845
between beef, red meat, 
and heart disease?

20:48.480 --> 20:51.550
- [Man] I honestly don't know 
'cause I don't do that ideas.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.352
That's not what I do. (laughs)

20:53.352 --> 20:54.920
- [Kip] Another organization 
rep that wasn't able

20:54.920 --> 20:56.488
to answer my questions

20:56.488 --> 20:59.391
but he said that he'd have 
someone get in touch shortly.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.193
I was, however, able to 
talk to the president

21:01.193 --> 21:04.663
of the American College of 
Cardiology, Dr. Kim Williams.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.331
- So, the American 
College of Cardiology

21:06.331 --> 21:09.901
is a 47,000-member and 
growing organization

21:11.336 --> 21:13.639
with a a dedicated mission 
to reduce heart disease

21:13.639 --> 21:15.907
and to improve patients' lives.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.176
And if you look at the 
incidence of hypertension

21:18.176 --> 21:21.113
and diabetes and 
mortality in men,

21:21.113 --> 21:24.850
they actually get reduced 
as you go higher and higher

21:24.850 --> 21:27.686
in terms of how much you 
restrict animal products.

21:27.686 --> 21:28.920
- [Kip] What about fish?

21:28.920 --> 21:30.622
- So, fish is a 
little different.

21:30.622 --> 21:34.793
You've got the four worries 
which is PCBs, mercury,

21:37.295 --> 21:39.765
saturated fat, and cholesterol.

21:39.765 --> 21:42.868
And the cholesterol 
is all over the place.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.903
You can eat tuna in water,

21:44.903 --> 21:48.173
that'll be almost less 
than a glass of milk

21:48.173 --> 21:52.911
to salmon or tilapia which 
is higher than a pork chop.

21:52.911 --> 21:54.846
- If you look 
objectively at fish,

21:54.846 --> 21:58.116
what you find is they become 
essentially mercury sponges.

21:58.116 --> 21:59.418
And that's why in many 
parts of the country,

21:59.418 --> 22:01.420
they warn you, "Don't 
have more than so many

22:01.420 --> 22:02.821
"of these fish a week

22:02.821 --> 22:04.156
"because it's getting 
too much mercury.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.090
"It can kill you."

22:05.090 --> 22:06.825
- Fish are eaten by bigger fish

22:06.825 --> 22:08.694
who are eaten by a bigger 
fish and these pesticides

22:08.694 --> 22:12.164
or herbicides bioaccumulate 
in the fish flesh.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.932
And the big fish 
including the salmon

22:13.932 --> 22:15.734
which people think 
is a healthiest fish.

22:15.734 --> 22:18.236
Truth is the amount of 
pesticides and herbicides

22:18.236 --> 22:20.772
in the flesh of these 
fish are shocking

22:20.772 --> 22:22.040
and they have estrogenic

22:22.040 --> 22:24.643
and cancer promoting 
properties in them.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.244
- They'll say, "Well, 
but don't sardines

22:26.244 --> 22:29.047
"have less concentration 
of toxic waste products

22:29.047 --> 22:30.549
"than other ones?"

22:30.549 --> 22:33.785
Something being less toxic 
doesn't make it healthy.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.620
It just makes it less toxic.

22:35.620 --> 22:38.356
- Farmed fish is by 
no means healthier.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.959
All the antibiotics that 
these animals have to be fed

22:40.959 --> 22:43.962
similar to chickens and 
turkeys kept in confinement.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.497
These fish get infections.

22:45.497 --> 22:48.033
They get fungal infections, 
they get bacterial infections,

22:48.033 --> 22:50.368
you've gotta feed them 
antifungals, antibiotics,

22:50.368 --> 22:54.005
and these substances accumulate 
in the fish flesh as well.

22:54.005 --> 22:56.108
- [Kip] I always knew that 
pollution was bad for our health

22:56.108 --> 22:57.542
but I never thought about

22:57.542 --> 22:59.344
the environmental 
pollutants affecting food.

22:59.344 --> 23:02.114
- Dioxins being the most 
toxic man-made chemicals

23:02.114 --> 23:04.216
known to science cause 
all sorts of things.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.785
They cause endometriosis, 
they cause cancers,

23:06.785 --> 23:09.087
they cause endocrine 
disruption problems.

23:09.087 --> 23:12.657
Most of your exposure, 93% 
of it comes from eating meat

23:12.657 --> 23:14.392
and dairy products 
because it climbs up

23:14.392 --> 23:16.161
in the food chain 
so effectively.

23:16.161 --> 23:18.697
So, you can get exposed 
living near these incinerators

23:18.697 --> 23:21.399
and breathing it but 
it'll take you 14 years

23:21.399 --> 23:24.002
to breathe in as 
much dioxin as a cow

23:24.002 --> 23:26.404
ingest by eating the 
grass in one day,

23:26.404 --> 23:28.907
and that dioxin will 
accumulate in as fat

23:28.907 --> 23:31.109
which includes the 
milk and the meat

23:31.109 --> 23:33.145
and anyone eating 
meat or dairy products

23:33.145 --> 23:35.514
is going to get 
that dose of dioxin

23:35.514 --> 23:37.682
so it climbs up the 
food chain every step.

23:37.682 --> 23:41.019
Men have no way in their 
bodies to get rid of dioxins

23:41.019 --> 23:42.921
but women have two ways.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.823
They're both involving 
having a baby.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.125
One is that dioxin 
crosses the placenta

23:47.125 --> 23:48.560
into the growing infant,

23:48.560 --> 23:51.163
and the other is that it 
comes out from the breastmilk.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.265
So, if you have a meat 
and dairy consuming mother

23:53.265 --> 23:54.833
breastfeeding that infant,

23:54.833 --> 23:57.903
then the highest impacts 
of toxic exposure

23:57.903 --> 24:00.038
like mercury and dioxins 
will give that infant.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.107
- Pregnant women are told 
of certain types of fish

24:02.107 --> 24:04.009
should be avoided but what about

24:04.009 --> 24:07.846
all these other animal 
products which are introducing.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.781
Imagine as the 
fetus is developing,

24:09.781 --> 24:12.584
introducing these 
very harmful toxins

24:12.584 --> 24:16.054
which create reproductive 
abnormalities,

24:16.054 --> 24:18.523
developmental problems 
and hormonal issues

24:18.523 --> 24:20.458
right as the child 
is developing,

24:20.458 --> 24:22.327
the most critical 
stage of development.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.196
- It does make you 
worry when people say,

24:24.196 --> 24:26.164
"Don't you wanna have 
a little bit of milk

24:26.164 --> 24:27.632
"because you're pregnant?

24:27.632 --> 24:28.733
"Don't you wanna have some 
fish 'cause you're pregnant?"

24:28.733 --> 24:29.668
Who do you think is gonna get

24:29.668 --> 24:31.102
the chemicals that are in that?

24:31.102 --> 24:34.339
- All these environmental 
toxins and toxins from the feed

24:34.339 --> 24:37.042
that they're being fed 
accumulate in their tissues

24:37.042 --> 24:39.277
and are released into the mother

24:39.277 --> 24:41.213
and unfortunately, to the child

24:41.213 --> 24:43.682
when you eat these products 
when you're pregnant.

24:43.682 --> 24:47.319
So, this includes 
antibiotics, hormones,

24:47.319 --> 24:49.654
steroids in animal feed.

24:49.654 --> 24:53.725
Commercial animals are 
largely fed GMO corn and soy

24:53.725 --> 24:56.361
which are very 
laden in pesticides.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.697
PCBs have been 
banned since the '70s

24:58.697 --> 25:02.067
but they persist in the 
environment, dioxins.

25:02.067 --> 25:06.504
All of these compounds can 
create hormonal reproductive,

25:06.504 --> 25:08.740
developmental damage as well.

25:08.740 --> 25:12.510
- Eating organic beef, 
poultry, pork or fish

25:12.510 --> 25:15.180
will not help you avoid 
contaminants like mercury,

25:15.180 --> 25:17.415
like dioxins, like strontium-90

25:17.415 --> 25:19.417
because they fall 
out over all sorts

25:19.417 --> 25:21.119
of farms fields 
and water bodies,

25:21.119 --> 25:23.121
and they don't skip 
over the organic fields.

25:23.121 --> 25:25.323
So, really the 
contaminants are coming in

25:25.323 --> 25:28.426
regardless of how these 
animals are raised.

25:28.426 --> 25:29.628
- [Kip] I had always 
been concerned

25:29.628 --> 25:31.263
about the possible 
health impacts of GMOs

25:31.263 --> 25:33.698
but then found out that most 
of the world's GMO crops

25:33.698 --> 25:35.533
are actually 
consumed by livestock

25:35.533 --> 25:37.903
with dairy cows consuming 
the most per animal.

25:37.903 --> 25:39.638
This fact with 
everything I'd learned

25:39.638 --> 25:42.140
about bioaccumulation 
made dairy terrifying

25:42.140 --> 25:45.410
especially considering how 
much cheese I ate in my life.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.979
- Cheese is an amazing product 
when you think about it.

25:47.979 --> 25:51.516
It's probably one of 
the single desk foods

25:51.516 --> 25:53.218
that compromising health

25:53.218 --> 25:55.053
that you're gonna 
actually feed to people.

25:55.053 --> 25:55.987
Think about it.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.522
You've got an animal product,

25:57.522 --> 26:00.425
so you've got all the issues 
of biological concentration.

26:00.425 --> 26:03.261
You with have a highly 
processed food product

26:03.261 --> 26:06.231
and not only does it have 
naturally a lot of saturated fat

26:06.231 --> 26:07.933
but you put a lot 
of salt into it.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.868
- There's a strong link 
between dairy foods

26:09.868 --> 26:13.004
and autoimmune diseases 
so that can show itself up

26:13.004 --> 26:16.474
as excessive production of mucus

26:16.474 --> 26:18.977
and exacerbation of asthma 
and kids who are prone to that

26:18.977 --> 26:20.578
and even adults and also,

26:20.578 --> 26:21.913
there's an association 
between dairy foods

26:21.913 --> 26:25.517
and multiple sclerosis 
and type 1 diabetes,

26:25.517 --> 26:27.152
which is an autoimmune disease

26:27.152 --> 26:29.788
and other 
rheumatological problems.

26:29.788 --> 26:33.491
- Cow's milk is baby 
calf growth food.

26:33.491 --> 26:35.627
That's what the stuff is.

26:35.627 --> 26:37.796
There's absolutely no 
child or human on earth

26:37.796 --> 26:39.798
who actually needs 
the milk of a cow

26:39.798 --> 26:42.734
any more than they need the 
milk of a giraffe or a mouse.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.904
- Most people in the world 
are lactose intolerant.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.505
I mean, that's the 
normal state of affairs.

26:47.505 --> 26:50.175
Why would your body 
create this enzyme

26:50.175 --> 26:53.011
to like just lactose after 
weaning, after infancy?

26:53.011 --> 26:54.512
It doesn't make any sense.

26:54.512 --> 26:57.649
- 73% of African-Americans 
are lactose intolerant,

26:57.649 --> 27:01.786
95% of Asians, roughly 
70% of Native Americans,

27:03.321 --> 27:06.725
and about 53% of 
Hispanic Americans are 
lactose intolerant.

27:06.725 --> 27:09.894
Our government is encouraging 
Americans of color

27:09.894 --> 27:13.098
to eat foods that it knows 
it's going to make them ill.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.566
Ultimately, what that is down to

27:14.566 --> 27:16.735
is the government are selling 
me as an African-American

27:16.735 --> 27:18.703
to eat food that's gonna make 
me ill for no health benefit

27:18.703 --> 27:21.539
so that it will 
benefit dairy farmers

27:21.539 --> 27:24.042
as if the farmers have 
institutionalized racism.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.978
- Yeah, milk is a risky 
food for human consumption.

27:26.978 --> 27:30.048
As a pediatrician, I 
see it on a daily basis,

27:30.048 --> 27:32.617
children suffering 
from conditions

27:32.617 --> 27:35.720
that are linked or associated 
to dairy consumption

27:35.720 --> 27:39.090
such as eczema, 
acne, constipation,

27:39.090 --> 27:42.394
acid reflux, 
iron-deficiency anemia.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.329
Cow's milk protein is 
the most allergenic food.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.765
- People say, "Well no, 
I want a hormone-free,

27:46.765 --> 27:49.367
"not injected with 
bovine growth hormone,"

27:49.367 --> 27:53.371
but milk is this hormonal 
fluid which is packed

27:53.371 --> 27:56.574
with sex hormones and 
natural sex steroid hormones

27:56.574 --> 27:58.076
like estrogen, progesterone.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.111
In fact, doesn't matter 
if it's conventional milk,

28:00.111 --> 28:01.980
doesn't matter if 
it's organic milk.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.282
Milk without hormones, 
this is an oxymoron.

28:04.282 --> 28:07.385
Organic dairy has just 
as much saturated fat

28:07.385 --> 28:10.255
and cholesterol and 
galactose, and all the things

28:10.255 --> 28:13.224
that you don't want 
as conventional dairy.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.093
- Dairy products, in 
general, have a lot

28:15.093 --> 28:17.262
of other products 
associated with it,

28:17.262 --> 28:18.930
not the least of which is pus.

28:18.930 --> 28:21.466
I mean, they actually have 
laws limiting how much pus

28:21.466 --> 28:23.568
you can actually have in 
the milk and still sell it.

28:23.568 --> 28:26.905
I believe it's like 
750,000 pus cells per CC.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.573
Because, I mean, you 
wouldn't want too much pus,

28:28.573 --> 28:30.842
it would be like pure 
pus people might object.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.077
In fact, you could 
think of cheese

28:32.077 --> 28:34.913
as coagulated cow 
pus if you will.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.181
- [Kip] But I was always told

28:36.181 --> 28:37.982
that we need milk 
for strong bones.

28:37.982 --> 28:41.152
- I'm Jane Chapman 
and not too long ago,

28:41.152 --> 28:44.756
finally got some x-rays 
of the hips and back.

28:44.756 --> 28:48.326
Severe bilateral 
osteoarthritis of the hips

28:49.761 --> 28:52.497
and actually, I'm scheduled 
for two hip replacements.

28:52.497 --> 28:56.901
That's bone on bone, it is 
the grinding of the joints.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.304
My stability is scary.

28:59.304 --> 29:02.207
I hold on to the 
walls if I'm at home.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.676
I've been told to use a walker.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.444
I'm only 61.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.046
This is not how you're 
supposed to live

29:08.046 --> 29:09.414
when you're this old.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.851
I have a really hard 
time believing that.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.721
That's all that's left.

29:16.721 --> 29:19.357
- Researchers have studied 
bone development in kids

29:19.357 --> 29:21.926
and whether they get stress 
fractures and that kind of thing

29:21.926 --> 29:24.529
and the kids drink the most 
milk have zero protection.

29:24.529 --> 29:26.631
Milk does not 
build strong bones.

29:26.631 --> 29:28.833
Harvard researchers have 
looked at a large group

29:28.833 --> 29:31.369
of older women over 
an 18-year period.

29:31.369 --> 29:34.572
The milk drinkers had zero 
protection from fractures.

29:34.572 --> 29:36.307
So, this old notion 
that somehow,

29:36.307 --> 29:38.009
milk is gonna build strong bones

29:38.009 --> 29:40.545
are protect your bones 
later in life, it's a myth.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.882
- People that drink milk have 
higher rates of hip fractures,

29:43.882 --> 29:47.552
have more cancer, and 
live shorter lives.

29:47.552 --> 29:48.786
- [Kip] It turns 
out that countries

29:48.786 --> 29:50.054
with the highest 
dairy consumption

29:50.054 --> 29:52.190
also have the highest 
rates of osteoporosis.

29:52.190 --> 29:55.593
So clearly, drinking more milk 
doesn't protect your bones.

29:55.593 --> 29:57.529
Doing more research, I've 
found that dairy was linked

29:57.529 --> 30:00.031
to many different types 
of cancer as well.

30:00.031 --> 30:01.499
Just like many of us,

30:01.499 --> 30:03.601
I thought that the majority 
of cancer's due to genes

30:03.601 --> 30:07.038
but only 5% to 10% of 
cancer's actually genetic.

30:07.038 --> 30:10.441
- Any cancer is caused 
by a DNA mutation

30:10.441 --> 30:12.177
but that's not enough so that

30:12.177 --> 30:13.444
can cause that first cancer cell

30:13.444 --> 30:15.547
but one cancer cell 
never killed anyone.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.282
Two cancer cells 
never killed anyone

30:17.282 --> 30:19.951
but a billion cancer cells, 
now, we're running into problems

30:19.951 --> 30:22.287
so we need to reduce the 
growth factors in our body

30:22.287 --> 30:24.756
like IGF-1, insulin-like 
growth factor 1.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.491
It's this cancer 
promoting growth hormone

30:26.491 --> 30:28.760
involved in every 
stage of cancer cell,

30:28.760 --> 30:31.362
growth and spread 
and metastasis.

30:31.362 --> 30:35.099
Any animal protein boosts 
the level of IGF-1.

30:35.099 --> 30:36.801
- Dairy products 
increases your risk

30:36.801 --> 30:38.570
for various forms of cancer

30:38.570 --> 30:40.605
especially those 
related to your hormones

30:40.605 --> 30:43.274
so breast cancer, prostate 
cancer, ovarian cancer.

30:43.274 --> 30:46.377
So, this is not a product 
even in its most pure state

30:46.377 --> 30:48.746
you wanna be consuming because 
it does come with risk.

30:48.746 --> 30:50.281
- [Kip] I've found out 
that dairy can increase

30:50.281 --> 30:53.451
a man's chance of getting 
prostate cancer by 34%.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.019
And for women who've 
had breast cancer,

30:55.019 --> 30:57.188
just one serving of 
whole dairy a day

30:57.188 --> 31:00.525
can increase their chance of 
dying from the disease, 49%,

31:00.525 --> 31:03.461
and dying from anything, 64%.

31:03.461 --> 31:05.997
Why weren't breast cancer 
sites like Susan G. Komen

31:05.997 --> 31:08.366
warning everyone about this?

31:08.366 --> 31:09.767
(phone ringing)

31:09.767 --> 31:11.302
- [Jocelyn] You're 
calling Susan G. Komen.

31:11.302 --> 31:13.571
This is Jocelyn, 
how may I help you?

31:13.571 --> 31:15.640
- We're wondering why you 
don't have a huge warning

31:15.640 --> 31:17.942
about the dangers of consuming 
dairy in your website

31:17.942 --> 31:20.211
when there's a direct 
link to breast cancer?

31:20.211 --> 31:21.679
There was a study published

31:21.679 --> 31:23.081
in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute,

31:23.081 --> 31:25.250
that found out women 
consuming dairy

31:25.250 --> 31:26.784
who has had breast cancer

31:26.784 --> 31:30.188
increases their risk of 
dying of breast cancer 49%.

31:30.188 --> 31:33.858
Just wondering why it's 
not on your website?

31:35.293 --> 31:36.861
- [Jocelyn] We cannot answer 
these types of questions.

31:36.861 --> 31:39.030
- [Kip] Once again, another 
health organization rep

31:39.030 --> 31:41.299
saying someone else would 
have to answer my question.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.201
Rather than risk 
being stood up again,

31:43.201 --> 31:45.370
I went straight to the 
local Susan G. Komen chapter

31:45.370 --> 31:47.705
to see if they would 
answer my questions.

31:47.705 --> 31:51.042
(tranquil guitar music)

31:53.077 --> 31:55.313
They didn't wanna answer my 
questions in person either

31:55.313 --> 31:57.215
and told us to stop filming,

31:57.215 --> 31:58.483
but promised they 
would connect me

31:58.483 --> 32:01.085
to the national office directly.

32:03.154 --> 32:05.556
Susan G. Komen's pink ribbon 
campaign had done a lot

32:05.556 --> 32:07.759
to raise awareness 
for breast cancer,

32:07.759 --> 32:10.228
although, it was confusing 
to see pink ribbons

32:10.228 --> 32:12.697
on dairy yogurt containers.

32:12.697 --> 32:14.799
- Breast cancer can be prevented

32:14.799 --> 32:17.268
with a healthy diet and 
lifestyle but we're not,

32:17.268 --> 32:19.904
we're talking about pink ribbons

32:19.904 --> 32:22.140
and putting all the money 
into research for the cure.

32:22.140 --> 32:25.843
I, for one, know that I would 
want my daughter, my mother,

32:25.843 --> 32:28.913
me, I wanna focus on not 
getting to that point

32:28.913 --> 32:30.148
and that's where I would like

32:30.148 --> 32:32.550
to see more energy 
and effort put.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.385
- [Kip] I had been a 
hardcore cheesaholic

32:34.385 --> 32:36.054
virtually my entire life

32:36.054 --> 32:37.655
despite the risks but 
like so many others,

32:37.655 --> 32:39.757
I seem to have been 
addicted to it.

32:39.757 --> 32:42.760
- It turns out that 
the casein protein,

32:42.760 --> 32:45.229
that's the main protein 
in dairy products

32:45.229 --> 32:46.898
particularly in 
cheese, it breaks apart

32:46.898 --> 32:49.000
in the human digestion to create

32:49.000 --> 32:50.935
what are called casomorphins,

32:50.935 --> 32:54.472
casein-derived 
morphine-like compounds.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.007
They go to the brain 
and they attach

32:56.007 --> 32:59.677
to the vary same receptor 
that heroin attaches to.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.813
Don't get me wrong, they're 
not as strong as that

33:01.813 --> 33:04.849
but they are strong enough 
to make you come back

33:04.849 --> 33:06.451
again and again and again

33:06.451 --> 33:08.052
despite the fact that 
you're gaining weight,

33:08.052 --> 33:10.021
you're more unhealthy 
than you've ever been,

33:10.021 --> 33:12.523
but that cheese just 
calls out to people.

33:12.523 --> 33:15.259
- Casomorphin may 
play a role in SIDS,

33:15.259 --> 33:18.363
in sudden infant death syndrome, 
they play a role in autism.

33:18.363 --> 33:22.233
This is one of the reasons 
why don't want infants

33:22.233 --> 33:24.435
drinking milk from cows.

33:24.435 --> 33:28.005
- [Kip] Human breastmilk has 
2.7 grams of casein per liter

33:28.005 --> 33:31.209
compared to 26 grams per 
liter for cow's milk.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.411
That's practically 
10 times more.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.213
No wonder it's so addictive.

33:35.213 --> 33:37.014
This talk about addiction 
made me think about

33:37.014 --> 33:39.050
all the drugs animals are fed.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.284
I went to the headquarters

33:40.284 --> 33:41.819
of the Center for 
Food and Safety,

33:41.819 --> 33:44.789
the nation's leading FDA 
government watchdog group

33:44.789 --> 33:47.959
to see how concerned we need 
to be about drugs in our food.

33:47.959 --> 33:51.929
- So, that we know of there are 
at least 450 different drugs

33:51.929 --> 33:53.197
that are administered to animals

33:53.197 --> 33:54.999
either alone or in combination.

33:54.999 --> 33:58.369
These drugs are given to animals 
for a variety of reasons.

33:58.369 --> 34:01.105
Very, very few of which 
are actually beneficial

34:01.105 --> 34:02.540
to consumer health.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.410
- We've got drug companies 
that work real hard

34:05.410 --> 34:08.279
to make sure they can 
sell lots of drugs

34:08.279 --> 34:11.114
to people raising cows, 
pigs, and chickens.

34:11.114 --> 34:13.684
- The pharmaceutical 
industry sells 80%

34:13.684 --> 34:15.987
of all the antibiotics that 
it makes in the United States

34:15.987 --> 34:17.688
to animal agriculture.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.524
Antibiotic residues 
are found in meat.

34:19.524 --> 34:21.391
Other antimicrobials 
are found in meat.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.360
There has been a 
ractopamine found in meat.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.029
There's been hormones 
found in meat.

34:25.029 --> 34:27.130
So, right there, you're talking 
about four different drugs.

34:27.130 --> 34:29.833
They could be in the 
same piece of meat.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.803
The pharmaceutical 
company supposed

34:31.803 --> 34:33.938
to show the safety 
of animal drugs.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.373
They're not really 
testing to see

34:35.373 --> 34:37.108
what the impacts of these 
drugs are on humans,

34:37.108 --> 34:38.409
they're really looking 
to see what impacts

34:38.409 --> 34:40.077
that these drugs are on animals.

34:40.077 --> 34:44.014
- We try to get information 
on some of the health studies

34:44.014 --> 34:47.217
and the environmental studies 
from federal agencies.

34:47.217 --> 34:52.023
We get back page after page 
of blacked out information

34:52.023 --> 34:56.793
because the company 
claim confidential 
business information.

34:56.793 --> 35:00.565
- Consumers have no idea 
what is in the products

35:00.565 --> 35:01.899
that they consume.

35:01.899 --> 35:03.668
- So, how sick 
something makes me

35:03.668 --> 35:06.771
and how bad it pollutes 
the environment

35:06.771 --> 35:08.673
is a secret for a company.

35:08.673 --> 35:10.241
- In the animal 
agriculture industry,

35:10.241 --> 35:11.709
as in the tobacco industry,

35:11.709 --> 35:14.278
these companies really 
have a vested interest

35:14.278 --> 35:17.181
in making sure that the public 
doesn't have information

35:17.181 --> 35:19.484
about their effects 
and what risks

35:19.484 --> 35:21.686
are really post 
to consuming them.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.454
- Have the system where animals

35:23.454 --> 35:25.389
are living in their own waste,

35:25.389 --> 35:29.193
they're living next to animals 
that are sick or even dead

35:29.193 --> 35:31.028
and they're stuck in 
cages with these animals.

35:31.028 --> 35:33.564
The bacteria tends to 
spread that the pathogens

35:33.564 --> 35:36.334
that are being created in 
these filthy conditions

35:36.334 --> 35:38.169
are breeding resistance 
to antibiotics

35:38.169 --> 35:40.538
and the public are 
becoming exposed to those.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.840
- We already had people 
dying from salmonella

35:42.840 --> 35:45.443
and other things that you eat.

35:45.443 --> 35:48.412
We have about 3,000 
people die every year

35:48.412 --> 35:49.981
in the United States.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.983
That's more than 
the number of people

35:51.983 --> 35:56.387
that were killed in 9/11 in 
the Twin Towers of New York.

35:56.387 --> 35:58.656
If we had some 
terrorists organization

35:58.656 --> 36:02.126
killing 3,000 people a year, 
we would be all over it.

36:02.126 --> 36:06.063
The antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria deaths that we have

36:06.063 --> 36:10.134
on top of that, you get a 
20,000 people die in a year.

36:10.134 --> 36:13.638
That's seven 9/11's every year.

36:14.972 --> 36:16.541
Can you imagine?

36:16.541 --> 36:18.543
If that many people 
were being killed

36:18.543 --> 36:21.646
by some terrorist group in 
the United States every year,

36:21.646 --> 36:23.014
we would find them.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.349
- The World Health Organization 
had said we're nearing

36:25.349 --> 36:27.585
in a post-antibiotic 
era in medicine.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.086
You'll be at risk 
in minor surgeries

36:29.086 --> 36:31.088
to have a fatal infection.

36:31.088 --> 36:32.623
You'll be at risk 
going to the dentist

36:32.623 --> 36:35.760
if you have a tooth extracted 
or be like Civil War medicine.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.296
You get an infection in your 
leg and you cut your leg off.

36:38.296 --> 36:40.731
So, you have this very 
dangerous situation.

36:40.731 --> 36:42.733
By crowding these animals in,

36:42.733 --> 36:46.304
they become a perfect 
engine for generating

36:46.304 --> 36:49.540
usually a virus that can 
come out into the community.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.577
If you lived near a 
swine spray field,

36:52.577 --> 36:56.080
not even decay field but 
the waste disposal field,

36:56.080 --> 37:00.518
you are three times more 
likely to have MRSA infection.

37:00.518 --> 37:04.922
You can't see how that impacts 
the average person's life

37:04.922 --> 37:07.058
in Duplin County, North Carolina

37:07.058 --> 37:09.961
and not be a little 
upset about it.

37:11.028 --> 37:12.763
- From environmental standpoint,

37:12.763 --> 37:14.198
from a community standpoint,

37:14.198 --> 37:16.434
from all other aspects, 
North Carolina,

37:16.434 --> 37:18.135
we're in a state of emergency.

37:18.135 --> 37:21.105
We've already had bouts 
of swine flu or H1N1

37:21.105 --> 37:22.673
as they prefer to refer to it.

37:22.673 --> 37:25.576
That particular swine flu 
incident was originated

37:25.576 --> 37:28.045
on a farm here in 
North Carolina.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.514
There's approximately 
the same number of hogs

37:30.514 --> 37:32.450
in North Carolina 
as there are people.

37:32.450 --> 37:35.720
Between eight to 10 
times the amount of feces

37:35.720 --> 37:37.888
is produced by a 
hog, an adult hog

37:37.888 --> 37:40.157
as compared to an adult human.

37:40.157 --> 37:41.792
- [Kip] 10 million 
pigs in North Carolina

37:41.792 --> 37:44.929
produce the waste equal 
to 100 million humans.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.332
This is the equivalent of the 
entire US eastern sea board

37:48.332 --> 37:50.868
flushing their toilets 
into North Carolina

37:50.868 --> 37:52.336
but there's no waste treatment.

37:52.336 --> 37:54.438
The pigs' waste falls 
through slats in the floors

37:54.438 --> 37:56.173
of the sheds they are 
forced to live in.

37:56.173 --> 37:58.109
It is then pumped in 
the giant waste pits

37:58.109 --> 37:59.977
which leach in the 
rivers and streams

37:59.977 --> 38:02.546
and is pumped out 
unfiltered on the fields

38:02.546 --> 38:06.217
further polluting 
the environment and 
neighboring health.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.918
- When you go back 
and you look at

38:07.918 --> 38:10.187
where these hog 
facilities are located,

38:10.187 --> 38:12.723
there's a disproportionate 
number of them

38:12.723 --> 38:15.826
that are located near 
communities of color,

38:15.826 --> 38:17.061
low income communities.

38:17.061 --> 38:20.231
It is definitely a 
human rights issue.

38:20.231 --> 38:22.733
- My sister, she have 
asthma and you know,

38:22.733 --> 38:25.336
her brother, he have asthma.

38:25.336 --> 38:29.440
He's three and we don't 
know what she might have.

38:30.841 --> 38:34.545
I have asthma, I have 
sinus, I have sarcoidosis,

38:34.545 --> 38:36.247
that's what the bacteria,

38:36.247 --> 38:40.851
and I have a pacemaker which 
is sick sinus syndrome.

38:40.851 --> 38:43.220
Mostly everybody in 
this neighborhood

38:43.220 --> 38:45.423
got asthma or even cancer.

38:45.423 --> 38:49.593
My neighbor there died from 
cancer probably just last year.

38:49.593 --> 38:51.696
My nephew down the 
street, he's got cancer.

38:51.696 --> 38:54.065
He's in terminal 
cancer stage four,

38:54.065 --> 38:56.634
not a smoker, not a drinker.

38:56.634 --> 38:59.670
And it's not in his lungs, 
it's in his lip nose.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.007
'Cause if you live here 
and saw the way they do,

39:03.007 --> 39:04.709
you will eat no pork.

39:04.709 --> 39:07.611
We don't eat bacon because 
I know it come from.

39:07.611 --> 39:10.181
When they die, 
they go into a box

39:10.181 --> 39:12.550
and they decompose 
because they swell from,

39:12.550 --> 39:14.218
especially from heat.

39:14.218 --> 39:17.054
A truck come and pick 'em up,

39:17.054 --> 39:19.957
take 'em to the processing 
plant in Roseville,

39:19.957 --> 39:24.829
round 'em up into feed, and 
feed it back to the hogs.

39:24.829 --> 39:26.564
Come at this door, if 
he's spraying there,

39:26.564 --> 39:28.032
it's then come in my face.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.567
It hits you right in that face.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.435
It smells like something that 
you had never smelled before,

39:31.435 --> 39:34.538
something rotten and dead body.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.107
It's the family graveyard.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.908
I have my grandmother there,

39:37.908 --> 39:40.511
my sisters, my brothers.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.880
When we go to funeral, 
he used to spray.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.081
- [Kip] During the funeral?

39:44.081 --> 39:46.517
- (mumbles) Yes, 
during the funeral.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.686
Yeah, they spray,

39:48.686 --> 39:50.287
and when the people come,

39:50.287 --> 39:52.890
everybody be closing their 
nose up saying how it stank.

39:52.890 --> 39:56.093
They can wanna with a cookout 
on Sunday, he'll spray.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.595
- Do you think he 
does that on purpose?

39:57.595 --> 40:00.531
- I think so 'cause he 
just spray at Sunday.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.700
He always spray at Sunday.

40:02.700 --> 40:06.370
And most of these area, hog 
houses and turkey house,

40:06.370 --> 40:09.940
is in the black area 
or the Hispanic area.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.575
It's either or.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.778
- Do you think it's 
also civil rights issue?

40:13.778 --> 40:16.113
- Yes, yes, I do, yes, I do.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.417
(truck passing)

40:23.821 --> 40:26.190
- There have been 
times in the past

40:26.190 --> 40:29.326
that I have gotten 
rid on the Sunday,

40:29.326 --> 40:30.795
gotten rid of going to church

40:30.795 --> 40:33.631
and come out and the 
smell was so strong

40:33.631 --> 40:36.433
that I had to go 
back and regroup

40:36.433 --> 40:37.868
because it got in my clothes

40:37.868 --> 40:40.437
and I ain't just 
gonna go to church

40:40.437 --> 40:43.140
smelling like hogs, 
I just can't do it.

40:43.140 --> 40:46.343
I don't think to grow my kids.

40:46.343 --> 40:49.180
They care more about cooperation

40:49.180 --> 40:52.149
than do people's inner visions.

40:52.149 --> 40:53.417
- And they're gonna keep on.

40:53.417 --> 40:54.919
They're gonna put more 
chickens in this state.

40:54.919 --> 40:56.387
This is the feces and you're 
in captain of the world

40:56.387 --> 40:59.423
right here in North 
Carolina, my state.

40:59.423 --> 41:01.425
There's a blue line 
stream right here

41:01.425 --> 41:03.093
come into my property almost

41:03.093 --> 41:04.528
and the continue 
creek, right here.

41:04.528 --> 41:06.831
I've seen that blue line 
stream in that field

41:06.831 --> 41:08.999
with feces and urine 
from that hog pen

41:08.999 --> 41:11.268
and they can say, "Well, 
we feed the world."

41:11.268 --> 41:12.903
They're not interested 
in feeding the world,

41:12.903 --> 41:14.371
they're interested 
in making money.

41:14.371 --> 41:17.141
You take the money away from 
and let the folks starve

41:17.141 --> 41:18.609
'cause if you want 
to feed the world,

41:18.609 --> 41:21.312
you can feed the world with 
more corn, using corn and wheat,

41:21.312 --> 41:22.813
instead of that and 
your canned meat.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.315
Meat is a luxury item.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.384
When we are doing things 
that hurt other people,

41:27.384 --> 41:30.020
we're wrong, but a 
lot of good people

41:30.020 --> 41:33.691
will sit there and 
eat bacon knowing

41:33.691 --> 41:37.862
that it's causing someone 
else to be very unhappy.

41:39.463 --> 41:40.631
- I woke up the next morning

41:40.631 --> 41:42.066
to find the Bern 
River had experienced

41:42.066 --> 41:43.734
another massive fish kill

41:43.734 --> 41:46.370
from the pollution 
running off hog farms.

41:46.370 --> 41:50.774
Tens of thousands of fish 
were washing up on shore.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.076
All this talk about 
health, I realized

41:52.076 --> 41:55.179
that I was only focused 
on personal health,

41:55.179 --> 41:57.715
but health started to 
mean so much more to me.

41:57.715 --> 42:00.284
It was about health of my 
family and our communities.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.253
I couldn't honor good, 
conscious supporting industry

42:02.253 --> 42:04.755
that I knew is harming others.

42:06.657 --> 42:09.293
Pollution from animal 
agriculture isn't just an issue

42:09.293 --> 42:10.728
in North Carolina though.

42:10.728 --> 42:13.430
Raising animals for food 
produces more greenhouse gases

42:13.430 --> 42:15.900
than the entire 
transportation sector.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.935
It's the leading cause of 
rainforest destruction,

42:17.935 --> 42:20.437
species extinction, 
ocean dead zones,

42:20.437 --> 42:22.673
and freshwater consumption.

42:27.745 --> 42:31.015
American Diabetes Association 
actually finally got back

42:31.015 --> 42:33.684
and they agreed to an interview.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.454
Preparing for the American 
Diabetes Association interview,

42:37.454 --> 42:39.023
I took a look at their diabetes

42:39.023 --> 42:40.758
diet meal plan recommendations

42:40.758 --> 42:42.726
and they were loaded with foods

42:42.726 --> 42:45.262
associated with 
causing diabetes.

42:45.262 --> 42:47.598
How could they expect 
people not to get diabetes

42:47.598 --> 42:50.701
if this was the food 
they're recommending?

42:50.701 --> 42:53.437
And then, I saw multiple 
peer reviewed studies

42:53.437 --> 42:55.572
published on the National 
Institute of Health website

42:55.572 --> 42:57.608
showing that a low-fat 
plant-based diet

42:57.608 --> 42:59.810
was more than twice as 
powerful at controlling

42:59.810 --> 43:03.414
and even reversing diabetes 
than the 88 recommended diet

43:03.414 --> 43:06.250
that included meat and dairy.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.820
- Well, the mission of the 
American Diabetes Association

43:09.820 --> 43:13.991
is to identify a prevention 
and a cure for diabetes.

43:16.460 --> 43:19.063
But in the meantime, 
to improve the lives

43:19.063 --> 43:22.333
of all people who are 
affected by diabetes.

43:22.333 --> 43:25.836
- And what's the best 
way to prevent this?

43:27.471 --> 43:30.307
- For type II 
diabetes, it's unclear.

43:30.307 --> 43:34.745
We can't prevent type II 
diabetes in everybody.

43:34.745 --> 43:37.948
- During a research, we 
came across a lot of studies

43:37.948 --> 43:42.119
that said that you actually 
could potentially cure

43:43.554 --> 43:47.091
or reverse diabetes with 
a purely plant-based diet.

43:47.091 --> 43:49.026
- I don't believe there 
is sufficient evidence

43:49.026 --> 43:50.694
to demonstrate that.

43:52.162 --> 43:56.266
- How does it compare to the 
ADA diet that you recommend?

43:56.266 --> 43:58.135
- We don't recommend 
a specific diet.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.738
We recommend healthy eating.

44:00.738 --> 44:02.239
- The one that's on the website?

44:02.239 --> 44:04.842
- We recommend healthy 
eating, there is--

44:04.842 --> 44:08.512
- You have a whole list 
of exact day-to-day,

44:09.947 --> 44:11.582
the meal plan, the 
whole meal plan?

44:11.582 --> 44:14.785
- All they are are selections 
of foods to consider.

44:14.785 --> 44:17.121
We do not have a diabetes diet.

44:17.121 --> 44:21.525
- But with that selections, 
do you consider that plan

44:21.525 --> 44:24.228
compared to a whole 
plant-based plan?

44:24.228 --> 44:26.497
- No one's done that study.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.265
- We've found 
actually some studies,

44:28.265 --> 44:31.035
a 74-week study found 
that low-fat vegan diet

44:31.035 --> 44:34.772
versus the ADA plan 
in type II diabetes--

44:34.772 --> 44:36.473
- I think we're done here.

44:36.473 --> 44:39.309
I'm not gonna get into 
an argument about--

44:39.309 --> 44:43.180
- Oh no, I just went 
into studies of, the 
studies of the...

44:43.180 --> 44:46.050
If this is true or if 
it's shows out of--

44:46.050 --> 44:47.451
- Any diet works.

44:49.319 --> 44:52.256
Any diet works if 
people follow it.

44:53.690 --> 44:57.061
- But if it's a diet 
that's not the proper diet,

44:57.061 --> 44:59.096
like if anyone follows 
a diet that the--

44:59.096 --> 45:02.699
- I can't tell you 
what a proper diet is.

45:02.699 --> 45:05.469
I can tell you what 
an improper diet is.

45:05.469 --> 45:09.073
- So then, we can talk 
about the good diets.

45:09.073 --> 45:10.007
I'm not sure why--

45:10.007 --> 45:11.675
- I'm not gonna get into that.

45:11.675 --> 45:12.509
- Into diet?

45:12.509 --> 45:13.844
- No. 
- Well, why not?

45:13.844 --> 45:16.447
- If that's where you 
wanna go with this,

45:16.447 --> 45:18.982
I'm sorry, I'm not the person 
that you should be talking to.

45:18.982 --> 45:20.350
- And why is that though?

45:20.350 --> 45:22.219
- If that's what 
you wanna get into,

45:22.219 --> 45:24.021
I'm not the person you 
need to be talking to.

45:24.021 --> 45:26.623
- [Kip] Who do we 
talk to about diet?

45:26.623 --> 45:28.525
- You can talk to 
anybody you want.

45:28.525 --> 45:30.861
- But that's interesting, 
then why not recommend a diet?

45:30.861 --> 45:32.896
- Because the data don't 
exist to support it.

45:32.896 --> 45:36.567
- But if I've see, we see 
data that we looked up,

45:36.567 --> 45:39.002
that supports it 
with like the NIH,

45:39.002 --> 45:41.171
in Europe, the European--

45:42.339 --> 45:43.440
- We're done.

45:44.975 --> 45:46.210
We're done, I'm sorry.

45:46.210 --> 45:47.377
I'm not gonna get 
into that argument.

45:47.377 --> 45:48.645
- But why is there an argument?

45:48.645 --> 45:49.580
- I'm not gonna get 
into that argument.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.081
- But why is there an argument?

45:51.081 --> 45:54.451
It's just the talking about 
in European Study of Diabetes

45:54.451 --> 45:58.222
and other places that 
have studies why--

45:58.222 --> 45:59.623
- There are lots of studies.

45:59.623 --> 46:01.058
- [Kip] Why is this 
even an argument?

46:01.058 --> 46:04.194
- There are lots of 
studies in the literature,

46:04.194 --> 46:07.064
many of which have 
never been replicated

46:07.064 --> 46:09.133
or frankly, you're wrong.

46:10.634 --> 46:13.704
That's why we do 
peer review, okay?

46:13.704 --> 46:16.740
- The European Association 
of Study of Diabetes

46:16.740 --> 46:18.809
has been peer reviewed or--

46:18.809 --> 46:21.111
- I don't know what 
study you're referring to

46:21.111 --> 46:23.614
and yeah, in the absence of 
being able to see that study,

46:23.614 --> 46:24.882
I'm not gonna comment.

46:24.882 --> 46:26.083
- I could show it to you.

46:26.083 --> 46:27.718
- I'm sorry, I don't 
have the time for that.

46:27.718 --> 46:28.652
- I just don't understand why

46:28.652 --> 46:31.221
it's an argument though or okay.

46:39.596 --> 46:41.198
That was interesting.

46:41.198 --> 46:42.432
What he wanna talk about

46:42.432 --> 46:44.468
was people living 
longer with diabetes

46:44.468 --> 46:47.804
but once he mentioned 
eliminating diabetes 
or prevention,

46:47.804 --> 46:50.274
oh, whoa, now you 
cross the line.

46:50.274 --> 46:55.145
Prevention and cure, whoa, 
whoa, let's not go there.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.948
Not only did Dr. Ratner, 
the chief medical officer

46:57.948 --> 47:00.150
of the American 
Diabetes Association

47:00.150 --> 47:02.019
not wanna talk about 
diet but the fact

47:02.019 --> 47:04.588
that he had such an emotional 
reaction to my question

47:04.588 --> 47:06.590
made it feel, I was 
digging into something

47:06.590 --> 47:08.559
that he didn't want uncovered.

47:08.559 --> 47:10.794
I had always thought 
there was no prevention

47:10.794 --> 47:13.430
for type I diabetes but then,

47:13.430 --> 47:15.499
I did research and came 
across countless studies

47:15.499 --> 47:17.134
referencing the link 
between exposure

47:17.134 --> 47:20.537
to dairy at a young 
age in type I diabetes.

47:20.537 --> 47:22.739
- This is a food 
made for baby cows.

47:22.739 --> 47:25.409
Cow milk protein get in the 
bloodstream and the body says,

47:25.409 --> 47:27.077
"Hey, this is not supposed 
to be in bloodstream."

47:27.077 --> 47:28.812
It makes antibodies, 
the cow milk protein,

47:28.812 --> 47:32.616
which then attack the pancreas 
and destroy the pancreas.

47:32.616 --> 47:34.084
- [Kip] How is this 
possible that ADA

47:34.084 --> 47:36.386
wouldn't have this 
forefront on their website?

47:36.386 --> 47:38.422
Why wouldn't they be warning 
all parents about this

47:38.422 --> 47:40.557
even if there are 
only a slight chance?

47:40.557 --> 47:42.226
Why were they 
recommending people

47:42.226 --> 47:45.095
to actually eat these 
foods linked to diabetes?

47:45.095 --> 47:47.197
It seemed all of the 
large health organizations

47:47.197 --> 47:49.366
were encouraging people 
to eat the very foods

47:49.366 --> 47:50.801
linked to the diseases,

47:50.801 --> 47:52.936
they're supposed to 
be fighting against.

47:52.936 --> 47:55.005
American Heart Association 
promoting beef,

47:55.005 --> 47:57.341
American Cancer Society 
promoting processed meat,

47:57.341 --> 47:59.209
pink ribbons on dairy products,

47:59.209 --> 48:03.447
and bacon wrapped shrimp on 
American Diabetes Association.

48:03.447 --> 48:06.750
And then, it all came together.

48:06.750 --> 48:07.584
What if?

48:12.256 --> 48:13.390
And there it was.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.758
The American 
Diabetes Association

48:14.758 --> 48:16.426
was taking money from Dannon,

48:16.426 --> 48:18.428
one of the world's largest 
dairy yogurt producers,

48:18.428 --> 48:20.697
Kraft Foods, makers of 
Velveeta processed cheese,

48:20.697 --> 48:22.099
Oscar Mayer processed meats,

48:22.099 --> 48:23.834
Lunchables processed 
kids' meals,

48:23.834 --> 48:28.005
and Bumble Bee Foods, makers 
of processed canned meats.

48:30.974 --> 48:33.543
American Cancer Society was 
taking money from Tyson,

48:33.543 --> 48:35.512
one of the world's 
largest meat producers

48:35.512 --> 48:39.716
and Yum brand, owner of Pizza 
Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell.

48:39.716 --> 48:42.386
Susan G. Komen was supposed 
to be fighting breast cancer

48:42.386 --> 48:44.454
was corporate 
partnering with KFC,

48:44.454 --> 48:48.458
Dietz & Watson processed 
meats, and Yoplait yogurt.

48:48.458 --> 48:49.826
And the American 
Heart Association

48:49.826 --> 48:52.296
was probably the most 
disturbing of all.

48:52.296 --> 48:53.897
Taking hundreds of 
thousands of dollars

48:53.897 --> 48:57.200
from the beef industry, 
poultry, and dairy producers,

48:57.200 --> 48:58.969
and millions from fast food

48:58.969 --> 49:01.672
and processed food 
manufacturers.

49:03.273 --> 49:05.342
Every single one of 
these organizations

49:05.342 --> 49:07.844
was taking money from 
meat and dairy companies

49:07.844 --> 49:11.214
that are associated with the 
causes of these diseases.

49:11.214 --> 49:12.749
This would be like the 
American Lung Association

49:12.749 --> 49:16.219
taking money from 
the tobacco industry.

49:16.219 --> 49:18.922
I was sick of not 
getting answers

49:18.922 --> 49:19.856
so I went to the headquarters

49:19.856 --> 49:21.758
of these organizations myself.

49:21.758 --> 49:23.794
We have to speak 
someone in person.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.563
There's millions of people 
dying from the foods

49:26.563 --> 49:29.433
that they are recommending 
people to eat.

49:29.433 --> 49:31.101
I wanted to find out 
why Susan G. Komen

49:31.101 --> 49:34.137
accepted 35 millions 
dollars from Yoplait

49:34.137 --> 49:36.006
when their products can 
increase a woman's chance

49:36.006 --> 49:38.975
of dying from breast cancer 49%.

49:38.975 --> 49:40.410
And asked American 
Cancer Society

49:40.410 --> 49:42.012
of taking money 
from KFC and Tyson

49:42.012 --> 49:45.248
what's the reason they 
promote eating meat.

49:45.248 --> 49:46.750
But everyone of 
these organizations

49:46.750 --> 49:49.820
declined to be interviewed.

49:49.820 --> 49:52.723
- What's really sad is that 
we cannot trust information

49:52.723 --> 49:55.625
from these leading 
health organizations

49:55.625 --> 49:57.127
like the American 
Heart Association,

49:57.127 --> 49:58.862
the American 
Diabetes Association,

49:58.862 --> 50:02.366
because they are taking money 
from the very industries

50:02.366 --> 50:04.034
who are causing the problems

50:04.034 --> 50:07.070
that they're supposed to 
be helping to prevent.

50:07.070 --> 50:09.973
- So, that makes 
the truth something

50:09.973 --> 50:13.143
that you are not gonna be 
hearing as far as nutrition goes

50:13.143 --> 50:15.145
from these organizations.

50:15.145 --> 50:16.680
Well, that would be the 
end of their funding,

50:16.680 --> 50:18.348
that would be the 
end of their jobs,

50:18.348 --> 50:20.283
there would be lawsuits, 
they would bring

50:20.283 --> 50:22.619
the entire catastrophe 
down upon their heads,

50:22.619 --> 50:24.688
and they would essentially 
disappear as organizations.

50:24.688 --> 50:27.924
- So, one time I got invited 
to a charity fundraiser

50:27.924 --> 50:30.193
for the American 
Diabetes Association.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.129
I showed up and they 
had a whole buffet

50:32.129 --> 50:35.098
and there was all 
just animal products.

50:35.098 --> 50:39.069
I remember like a big 
thing of barbecue chicken,

50:39.069 --> 50:40.737
and I was, like I stormed out.

50:40.737 --> 50:44.408
I said, "Serving chicken 
at a diabetes event

50:45.909 --> 50:48.412
"is like serving alcohol 
in an AA meeting.

50:48.412 --> 50:50.814
"It just doesn't make sense."

50:51.982 --> 50:53.316
- [Kip] We had scheduled 
a filming interview

50:53.316 --> 50:55.185
with a prominent surgeon

50:55.185 --> 50:57.020
but before we could get 
inside the building,

50:57.020 --> 51:00.457
the hospital's media 
relations manager stopped us.

51:00.457 --> 51:01.925
- [Lady In White Blouse] 
Actually, I understand

51:01.925 --> 51:03.560
that Dr. (bleeps) that 
you could film here today

51:03.560 --> 51:06.963
but unfortunately, that's 
not gonna be able to happen.

51:06.963 --> 51:09.733
I know that he advocates for 
patients changing their diets

51:09.733 --> 51:12.402
but the hospital makes 
money off these surgeries

51:12.402 --> 51:14.438
and the reality is he does too.

51:14.438 --> 51:16.907
So, we can't do anything 
that's gonna negatively

51:16.907 --> 51:18.742
impact the hospital 
so unfortunately,

51:18.742 --> 51:22.746
you're not gonna be 
able to film here today.

51:22.746 --> 51:24.548
- [Kip] I was sickened 
by how open she was

51:24.548 --> 51:26.450
about the hospital 
being more interested

51:26.450 --> 51:29.419
in profits than people's health.

51:29.419 --> 51:32.456
But it wasn't just this 
hospital or these organizations,

51:32.456 --> 51:35.225
even the US government 
is involved too.

51:35.225 --> 51:37.327
Every five years, the US 
Department or Agriculture

51:37.327 --> 51:39.529
creates dietary 
guidelines for Americans.

51:39.529 --> 51:41.298
The committee who 
writes these guidelines

51:41.298 --> 51:42.699
has been made up of individuals

51:42.699 --> 51:44.334
who have received 
money from McDonald's,

51:44.334 --> 51:46.703
the National Dairy Council, 
the American Meat Institute,

51:46.703 --> 51:47.971
the National Dairy Board,

51:47.971 --> 51:49.439
the National Livestock 
and Meat Board,

51:49.439 --> 51:52.142
the American Egg Board, Dannon, 
candy and sugar companies,

51:52.142 --> 51:55.145
Coca-Cola, and Anheuser, 
just to name a few,

51:55.145 --> 51:57.214
which means we're getting 
our dietary recommendations

51:57.214 --> 51:59.783
from the very industries 
that are killing us.

51:59.783 --> 52:02.986
- And when they, the 
USDA, makes a pyramid

52:02.986 --> 52:06.223
or a power plate every five 
years for the American public,

52:06.223 --> 52:08.058
they're gonna guarantee 
that on that plate

52:08.058 --> 52:11.228
are gonna be foods 
which when consumed,

52:11.228 --> 52:15.332
will result in means of 
American's perishing.

52:15.332 --> 52:17.367
- The USDA which is 
supposed to be protecting us

52:17.367 --> 52:19.503
has two missions, it's 
supposed to protect us

52:19.503 --> 52:22.906
and it's supposed to protect 
the producer, and guess what?

52:22.906 --> 52:25.075
When those two 
come head to head,

52:25.075 --> 52:26.610
they usually choose 
the producer.

52:26.610 --> 52:29.045
- [Kip] In internal documents 
uncovered by Dr. Gregor,

52:29.045 --> 52:31.781
the USDA admitted that eggs 
cannot legally be called

52:31.781 --> 52:34.017
nutritious, low-fat, part 
of the balanced diet,

52:34.017 --> 52:35.785
low calorie, healthful, healthy,

52:35.785 --> 52:38.355
can't say it's good 
for you, or even safe,

52:38.355 --> 52:39.823
yet they still 
promote these products

52:39.823 --> 52:43.126
to the American people through 
federal checkoff programs.

52:43.126 --> 52:44.594
- If you ask somebody 
if they've heard

52:44.594 --> 52:46.496
the checkoff program, they'll 
answer that they haven't,

52:46.496 --> 52:49.132
although daily, they 
are seeing the messaging

52:49.132 --> 52:50.934
that these programs produce.

52:50.934 --> 52:52.702
So, checkoff programs 
are responsible

52:52.702 --> 52:55.505
for the messages 
that we see on TV,

52:55.505 --> 52:57.574
on the internet, on bus 
billboards, and magazines

52:57.574 --> 53:00.076
that say things like, "Milk, 
it does the body good"

53:00.076 --> 53:03.313
or "Milk life," "Beef, 
it's what's for dinner,"

53:03.313 --> 53:06.716
"Pork, be inspired," 
"Incredible, edible egg."

53:06.716 --> 53:10.554
- The dairy checkoff program, 
be it 12 million dollars

53:10.554 --> 53:14.257
to dominoes, to just market 
cheese-heavy product.

53:14.257 --> 53:16.359
And this is the USDA, 
this is the government.

53:16.359 --> 53:18.428
If you've seen those ads 
for the Pizza Hut pizza,

53:18.428 --> 53:21.898
the stuffed crust or 
a pound of cheese,

53:21.898 --> 53:24.167
those are all government 
advertising schemes

53:24.167 --> 53:25.468
for the industry.

53:25.468 --> 53:26.970
How can we put more 
cheese on beef,

53:26.970 --> 53:31.041
how can we put more milk in 
a coffee, things like that

53:31.041 --> 53:33.543
to just drive 
consumption of these

53:33.543 --> 53:36.446
just unbelievably 
unhealthful products.

53:36.446 --> 53:37.614
So, McDonald's, for instance,

53:37.614 --> 53:40.684
has six people staffed full-time

53:40.684 --> 53:42.218
according to records we've found

53:42.218 --> 53:45.755
who's salaries are paid for 
by this government program

53:45.755 --> 53:48.992
but funded by the producers 
who are regulated by it.

53:48.992 --> 53:51.695
And these six people sit there 
at McDonald's headquarters

53:51.695 --> 53:54.030
and just come up with ideas.

53:55.231 --> 53:58.234
- Triple cheese decker McCheese

53:58.234 --> 54:01.071
muffin stuffed 
bacon cheese slider?

54:04.774 --> 54:05.909
- With extra cheese?

54:05.909 --> 54:07.277
- [All] Yes.

54:07.277 --> 54:09.579
- You don't think of it 
on a day-to-day basis

54:09.579 --> 54:12.048
that these are 
government programs.

54:12.048 --> 54:16.219
Wendy's bacon 
double cheeseburger, 
government program.

54:17.687 --> 54:21.191
The steak fajita at Dunkin' 
Donuts, government program.

54:21.191 --> 54:23.827
You would just never think 
that this just pure garbage

54:23.827 --> 54:26.529
from a food standpoint is coming

54:26.529 --> 54:28.665
from a federally funded program.

54:28.665 --> 54:30.233
That's one of the things 
that makes checkoffs

54:30.233 --> 54:33.837
so incredibly creepy is 
that it is our government

54:33.837 --> 54:36.539
telling us, "Eat more 
beef, drink more milk,

54:36.539 --> 54:38.908
"eat more cheese, 
eat more pork."

54:38.908 --> 54:40.944
One of the very effective 
ways that the dairy industry

54:40.944 --> 54:44.447
promotes its products 
is to reach children

54:45.315 --> 54:47.617
because kids are impressionable,

54:47.617 --> 54:50.020
they're gonna be consumers 
for their entire lives,

54:50.020 --> 54:51.955
and you might as well get 
'em while they're young.

54:51.955 --> 54:54.424
So, dairy spends at 
least 50 million dollars

54:54.424 --> 54:57.060
promoting it's products 
in public schools

54:57.060 --> 54:59.462
throughout the 
country with posters

54:59.462 --> 55:01.598
with people with milk mustaches

55:01.598 --> 55:05.001
and messages like, "Milk, 
it does the body good,"

55:05.001 --> 55:06.503
or "Milk life".

55:06.503 --> 55:08.872
- Targeting young people 
like the tobacco industry

55:08.872 --> 55:11.107
had to keep replacing the 
customers who are dying

55:11.107 --> 55:13.109
with new customers.

55:13.109 --> 55:15.612
Meat industry knows they 
have to target young people,

55:15.612 --> 55:17.981
that's why we have 
these foods in schools

55:17.981 --> 55:20.150
and marketing messages at 
a younger and younger age

55:20.150 --> 55:22.852
for kids to get hooked on 
all the wrong kinds of foods.

55:22.852 --> 55:25.221
So, there's all 
kinds of parallels.

55:25.221 --> 55:27.457
- School districts 
where processed meats

55:27.457 --> 55:28.692
are all over the place.

55:28.692 --> 55:29.959
Maybe it's gonna be 
bacon on the menu,

55:29.959 --> 55:32.929
sausage, hotdogs, 
or pepperoni pizza.

55:32.929 --> 55:34.397
Any of those things 
are processed meats

55:34.397 --> 55:36.700
and those are pretty much 
the worst of the worst

55:36.700 --> 55:38.835
with a direct link 
to colon cancer

55:38.835 --> 55:41.071
and yet you have 
everyday in schools,

55:41.071 --> 55:43.239
meal items with processed meats.

55:43.239 --> 55:44.774
- [Kip] If the surgeon 
general puts label warnings

55:44.774 --> 55:47.343
on tobacco because 
of their cancer risk,

55:47.343 --> 55:50.613
why aren't same 
warning labels on meat?

55:51.681 --> 55:53.450
- Based on the publicly 
available data,

55:53.450 --> 55:56.486
we know they spend at 
least 557 million dollars

55:56.486 --> 55:59.089
promoting their goods 
through checkoff programs.

55:59.089 --> 56:01.758
We know that they spend at 
least 138 million dollars

56:01.758 --> 56:03.393
lobbying congress.

56:03.393 --> 56:05.695
We expect that they spend 
a good deal more than that

56:05.695 --> 56:08.531
in figures that simply 
aren't publicly disclosed.

56:08.531 --> 56:10.366
- [Kip] The industry's 
lobbying power is so strong

56:10.366 --> 56:12.602
that they can create laws 
and push through legislation

56:12.602 --> 56:15.071
that doesn't benefit 
Americans in any way

56:15.071 --> 56:17.707
such as Ag-gag laws that 
criminalize whistle-blowing

56:17.707 --> 56:20.243
or photographing abuses 
by this industry.

56:20.243 --> 56:22.145
Activists in the US can 
be charged as terrorist

56:22.145 --> 56:24.380
for disrupting the 
profits of any business

56:24.380 --> 56:27.584
that uses animals under the 
Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act

56:27.584 --> 56:32.222
to the even more ridiculous 
ones like Cheeseburger Laws.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.823
- A Cheeseburger Law 
is a law that states

56:33.823 --> 56:35.892
a plaintiff cannot 
recover against

56:35.892 --> 56:37.961
a manufacturer, 
distributor, retailer

56:37.961 --> 56:41.965
on the theory that the food 
made the plaintiff obese

56:41.965 --> 56:44.934
or caused an 
obesity-related disease.

56:44.934 --> 56:47.303
- Cheeseburger Law 
is a direct response

56:47.303 --> 56:51.007
to a problem that the 
tobacco industry has had.

56:51.007 --> 56:53.510
Big tobacco has paid 
400 billion dollars

56:53.510 --> 56:55.378
to state medicated programs.

56:55.378 --> 56:57.347
Cheeseburger Law, 
it's proponent say,

56:57.347 --> 56:59.783
"We don't wanna see the 
same kind of thing happen

56:59.783 --> 57:01.651
"to the meat and 
dairy industries."

57:01.651 --> 57:04.087
The fact that these laws are 
based on a model template

57:04.087 --> 57:07.624
called the Commonsense 
Consumption Act 
is actually ironic

57:07.624 --> 57:09.092
because what they're saying is,

57:09.092 --> 57:11.294
you the consumer should 
have a commonsense

57:11.294 --> 57:13.963
to know that our 
food is bad for you.

57:13.963 --> 57:17.167
- I've often typify the 
meat industry to people

57:17.167 --> 57:20.537
who maybe don't understand 
its power and reach

57:20.537 --> 57:24.507
as it's got all the money of 
big tobacco and big pharma

57:24.507 --> 57:28.511
and has the personality of the 
National Rifle Association.

57:28.511 --> 57:31.214
So, any little 
thing that comes up,

57:31.214 --> 57:34.217
man, they beat it to death.

57:34.217 --> 57:35.852
- [Kip] Robert Martin 
wasn't exaggerating.

57:35.852 --> 57:38.054
When the profits of the ag 
industry were threatened

57:38.054 --> 57:40.623
by ag alternative company, 
Hampton Creek Foods,

57:40.623 --> 57:43.092
extremely disturbing 
emails were uncovered

57:43.092 --> 57:45.228
by Ryan Shapiro 
and Jeffrey Light.

57:45.228 --> 57:47.931
- We uncovered documents 
demonstrating the 
American Ag Port

57:47.931 --> 57:51.901
considers Hampton Creek, quote, 
a crisis and a major threat

57:51.901 --> 57:54.270
to the future of the 
American ag industry.

57:54.270 --> 57:55.738
The American Ag Board considers

57:55.738 --> 57:58.675
a successful ag replacer 
company to be such a threat

57:58.675 --> 58:01.644
that they joke under 
government email addresses

58:01.644 --> 58:04.047
about murdering the CEO.

58:04.047 --> 58:05.515
- [Kip] In internal 
government emails

58:05.515 --> 58:07.283
with the heads of 
the ag industry,

58:07.283 --> 58:09.819
they suggest having the 
CEO of Hampton Creek,

58:09.819 --> 58:12.455
Josh Tetric, murdered,

58:12.455 --> 58:14.791
including a menacing email 
from executive director

58:14.791 --> 58:16.893
of the American Ag Board.

58:21.731 --> 58:25.501
- The meat producers don't have 
to pay for the heart disease

58:25.501 --> 58:27.704
and the environmental 
destruction

58:27.704 --> 58:32.175
or any of the other 
externalities as 
economists call them

58:32.175 --> 58:34.978
that their products cause.

58:34.978 --> 58:36.212
- You know, then 
there's the whole

58:36.212 --> 58:37.747
pharmaceutical aspect of it

58:37.747 --> 58:39.048
and the fact that 
there's a very strong

58:39.048 --> 58:40.850
pharmaceutical industry in lobby

58:40.850 --> 58:44.120
that has a huge stake at 
preserving the status quo.

58:44.120 --> 58:46.923
- These chronic diseases, 
these are the cash cows

58:46.923 --> 58:48.491
of the pharmaceutical industry.

58:48.491 --> 58:51.094
- We have a five billion 
dollar stent industry.

58:51.094 --> 58:52.762
Do they ever wanna 
see that go away?

58:52.762 --> 58:55.732
We've had 35 billion dollar 
statin drug industry.

58:55.732 --> 58:57.300
Do they ever wanna 
see that go away?

58:57.300 --> 58:58.701
- I'm talking about the 
pharmaceutical industry

58:58.701 --> 59:01.771
effectively controls 
what doctors are told.

59:01.771 --> 59:03.840
- Most research isn't 
put into prevention,

59:03.840 --> 59:05.875
it's put into the medication

59:05.875 --> 59:09.145
that we might use for 
that particular disease.

59:09.145 --> 59:12.849
- I'm on two different high 
blood pressure medicines,

59:12.849 --> 59:17.020
six asthma-type medicines, 
even after four years of shots,

59:18.922 --> 59:21.758
and then another medicine to 
help take care of side effects

59:21.758 --> 59:23.559
from some of those medicines.

59:23.559 --> 59:26.396
I'm on high level 
antidepressants,

59:27.864 --> 59:31.534
a couple of different pain 
meds for my back and hips.

59:31.534 --> 59:34.237
- I'm taking about 16 drugs

59:34.237 --> 59:36.506
not counting the 
insulin in the morning.

59:36.506 --> 59:39.509
I take insulin morning, 
insulin at night,

59:39.509 --> 59:42.111
like 32 to 34 units of insulin.

59:44.247 --> 59:46.082
Lantus to be exact.

59:46.082 --> 59:49.452
Some of these meds 
are for diabetes.

59:49.452 --> 59:53.489
This is for pN, I have to 
use this for my prostate,

59:53.489 --> 59:55.925
and then I have to 
use this for the heart

59:55.925 --> 59:58.494
and I have to use this 
for blood pressure.

59:58.494 --> 01:00:01.664
And it's just on and 
on and on and on.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.867
The doctors are telling 
me this is what I gotta do

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.970
for my whole life 
and it's frustrating,

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.238
and it's very stressful.

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.474
I don't know how long 
my liver is gonna last

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.142
taking all these stuff.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.477
- Under conventional 
medical treatment,

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:16.012
whether it be for 
autoimmune disease,

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:19.382
or even conditions like high 
blood pressure or diabetes,

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:22.218
you're told the you 
have to take drugs

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:25.054
and not just for a week 
or a month or a year,

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.824
you're told that you have 
to take drugs forever.

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:30.593
You're guaranteed that if you 
follow your doctor's advice,

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:34.364
you'll be sick forever, 
you'll never get well.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.232
That's the guarantee.

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:39.469
Because the strategies 
are all about manipulating

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.205
the symptoms, not dealing 
with the underlying cause.

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.506
- You'll come in 
with that diagnosis.

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:45.441
You get a bunch of pills 
that have nothing to do

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.211
with the disease causation 
or you get this procedures

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:50.913
that have nothing to do 
with disease causation.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.181
- It's a deception to say,

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:54.584
"This pill will help you 
unclog your arteries.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.252
"This one will save 
you from stroke."

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.487
No, it doesn't.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.888
The people who take 
the statins, et cetera,

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.390
they still get 
their heart attacks,

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.624
they still get their strokes,

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.059
this is not reversed disease,

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:05.061
this does not make 
plaque smaller.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.764
This is a fun of 
massive proportions.

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.432
- [Kip] In the US, 
treating chronic these

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.701
such as heart disease, 
cancer, and diabetes

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:15.304
is a 1.5 trillion 
dollar industry.

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.906
That's the GDP equivalent

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:20.043
of the 10th richest 
country in the world.

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.210
I went back and dug deeper

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.179
into the health 
organizations funding

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.448
and there it was again.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.717
These organizations were 
accepting millions of dollars

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.385
from pharmaceutical companies

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.020
that are making 
billions of dollars

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.089
from the very same diseases 
these health groups

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.324
are supposedly trying to end.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.593
It seemed like a major 
conflict of interest

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:40.863
unless ending these diseases 
isn't really the goal.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.665
The pharmaceutical 
industry spends more money

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:45.301
on lobbying than any 
other single industry.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.470
Just like animal agriculture, 
they are so powerful,

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.971
they write their own laws

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:51.207
that have had activists 
imprisoned to silence them.

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:54.077
- Government's embed with 
anyone that goes in the money.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.411
Just pharmaceutical industry

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:57.747
which is the animal 
ag industries.

01:01:57.747 --> 01:02:00.583
They are pumping the government 
full of money and resources

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.652
and in return, the governments 
giving them what they want,

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:06.355
subsidies, imprisoning 
activists that go against them,

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.357
and I think it's quite 
telling that these industries

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:11.794
are working so hard in 
spending so much money

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.797
to criminalize people for 
simply taking a picture,

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.899
for simply recording 
what's going on inside

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:20.036
of these facilities and 
making it known to the public.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:21.404
They're behind walls.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.972
They're underground.

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:25.341
They're in these 
secret facilities that 
no one knows about

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:27.210
but if they did, they would 
be shocked and outraged

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.212
and I think people 
would not want to think

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.914
that their pharmaceuticals, 
that their food

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.549
are coming from these places

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.151
and that's why, I 
think, it's such...

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:36.819
The Ag-gag laws 
are what they are

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:39.188
is because they are 
trying to silence people

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:41.824
into not speaking out and 
not showing the truth.

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.559
- [Kip] I finally realized 
how deep the occlusion

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:46.429
truly is between government 
and these industries

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.664
and how dangerous it 
could be to expose them.

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.600
These concerns 
intensified after meeting

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.469
the USDA whistleblower who 
revealed mad cow disease

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:54.904
in the US meat supplier.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.172
- [Mad Cow Disease 
Whistleblower] USDA operates

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.940
like the military 
so when I got on TV,

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.009
right away you see set of memos

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.111
to all the veterinarians 
and food inspectors.

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:04.514
"If anybody from the 
media ever contacts you,

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:08.151
"do not talk to them, 
refer to Washington, DC

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:10.319
"and we will talk to them."

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.054
So, right away 
shut up everybody.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:15.391
The American public are very, 
very concerned about this,

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.993
what's going on with the USDA.

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.327
Here in the United States,

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:21.297
we have at least four 
cases of mad cow disease

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.799
but I'm almost positive 
there's more cases of that

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:25.668
that the government 
is looking for.

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:26.969
- [Kip] So, what you're 
saying is that there could be

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.405
already mad cow 
disease in humans?

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:32.074
- Right, and I think a lot 
of it was misdiagnosed.

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:33.776
The Alzheimer's or dementia

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:36.312
that takes several years 
to see the progression

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.847
but to make it easier,

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:40.149
these doctors just sign off on 
it as dementia or Alzheimer's

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:41.751
while they should've 
taken a biopsy

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.352
of the brain to see if it's that

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.755
or is it actually 
a prion disease

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:48.958
like Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease or mad cow disease.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.294
- [Kip] Do you think 
it's safe to eat meat?

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:53.596
- I personally don't 
think it's safe to eat it

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:56.566
because of the fact how the 
line speeds are increasing

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:59.635
and also our inspectors are 
not well-trained enough.

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:01.571
At the present time, 
the ones we know

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:04.106
is going about 220 cows an hour.

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:07.009
That gives you about, somewhere 
around four cows per minute

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.412
so that's 15 seconds per cow.

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:11.914
- [Kip] This dangerous 
slaughter speeds means

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:14.584
that animal waste 
ends up everywhere.

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.686
Testing shows 88% of pork chops

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.055
are contaminated 
with fecal bacteria.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:22.491
90% of ground beef and 95% 
of chicken breasts sample

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:24.827
contain animal waste bacteria.

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:28.064
There is nothing clean 
about eating this way

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:32.301
but it just isn't waste, it's 
also pus-filled infections.

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:33.803
- [Mad Cow Disease 
Whistleblower] You can see

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:36.505
there's a bump or some kind 
of abcess underneath the hind.

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:38.608
Most of the time, when 
the hind's pulled off,

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.244
either that will 
open up the abcess

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.712
and the pus will come out

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.981
or if it's deep-seated 
when the inspectors

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.350
are doing their work 
or company employees,

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.819
they might stick their 
knife into an abcess

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:53.222
and that explodes 
all over the place.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.390
- [Kip] I had heard enough.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.325
I was utterly disgusted 
by the corruption,

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:59.895
the greed, the disease, and 
the abuse I was learning about.

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:01.797
The very animals we are killing

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.733
were killing us in the planet

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.968
but so many people 
are even eating dairy

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:07.503
every day of their lives.

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:10.239
And we are so concerned 
about getting enough protein.

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:12.875
Do we have to eat meat 
to get complete protein?

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:15.478
- Oh my god, oh my god.

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.980
You want me to jump of 
this building, don't you?

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.585
Well, first of all, all 
protein is made by plants.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.487
I'll state that 
again for the record.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:27.790
All protein is initially 
made by plants, all of it,

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:31.494
and it is not necessary 
to eat animal tissue

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.329
in order to get protein.

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:37.266
Only plants have the ability 
to actually take nitrogen

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.902
from the air, break 
those molecules apart,

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.237
and incorporate that nitrogen

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:44.407
into amino acids and 
then make protein.

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.941
Any protein you 
get from an animal

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:48.244
is simply recycled 
plant protein.

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:51.247
- If you eat a diet that 
was calorically adequate

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:53.182
and even things like 
brown rice and broccoli

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:54.617
and you got enough of it.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.219
You'd get enough both quantity 
and quality of protein.

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.155
2,000 calories of 
brown rice and broccoli

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:01.157
is gonna be about 80 
grams of protein a day

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:03.025
including the 
essential amino acids

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.761
that you need in order to 
maintain optimum health.

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:07.830
- I mean, the grains 
are loaded with protein.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.632
Beans are loaded with protein.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.034
Vegetables are 
loaded with protein.

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:15.137
- You really want to get 
your protein from plants

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:18.641
because plant proteins have 
a much more beneficial effect

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.142
on our physiology.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.044
- The funny thing about 
protein is most Americans

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:24.146
get about twice the 
amount they need.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.715
Most Americans are getting less

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.917
than half the amount 
of fiber they need

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.019
but the conversation tends 
to always be about protein.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:33.122
So, my mind, it's just this 
magical marketing campaign

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:35.558
that protein has taken 
on over are decades.

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:37.393
- The question is not 
where to get your protein,

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.161
it's really where do 
you get your fiber?

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.464
- I've never in my 
professional career

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.865
seen a protein deficiency.

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.166
I've never seen someone come in,

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:46.035
eating normal 
amounts of calories

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.436
and their protein deficient.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:48.904
You just don't see that.

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:52.475
- So, human milk has the 
lowest protein content ever

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.610
in any species ever tested.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:57.580
That's the fluid that's 
been designed by evolution

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.115
over millions of years.

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:03.219
That's like the perfect food 
for human babies, right?

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:06.989
Perfect food, lowest protein 
content any other mammal.

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:09.759
So, it gives a sense of 
protein requirements for--

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:10.793
(Kip mumbles)

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:11.627
Anything.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:12.862
- [Kip] Like unit.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:15.398
- Than rat milk, ape milk-- 
- Really?

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:17.967
- Donkey milk, any milk 
that's ever been tested.

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.502
- You hear this a 
lot in body builders.

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:24.273
Well, I need a chicken or 
I need fish to be strong,

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.474
to build muscle tissue.

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:27.410
That is utter nonsense.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:31.080
The largest, strongest 
terrestrial animals 
on the planet

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.548
are all herbivores.

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:35.151
The biggest, strongest 
animals are all herbivores.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:37.920
- When we bring in people 
and they're on meaty diets

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.588
and we transition them 
to a plant-based diet,

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:40.923
we always track 
what their eating.

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:43.192
Their vitamin intake goes up.

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:46.195
Their nutrition overall 
goes up dramatically better

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:48.697
and these same people 
might worry in advance,

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.466
"Will I get the 
nutrition that I need

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:51.567
"on a plant-based diet?"

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.235
The fact is, you're not getting

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.104
the nutrition you need 
on a meat-based diet

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.539
and you're gonna 
get dramatically

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:58.307
better nutrition on 
a plant-based diet.

01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:00.943
- For an average-sized 
guy like myself,

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:04.313
I need about 56 grams of 
protein a day, that's optimum.

01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:06.782
Probably, I really need 
30 to 40 grams a day.

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.350
Diets are really 
high on these protein

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:12.188
create diabetes, create 
heart disease, create cancer,

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:15.191
create the diseases that I'm 
treating on a daily basis.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.358
- [Kip] But this is the opposite

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.694
of all the high 
protein diet fads say.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.962
- The food you eat 
determines the bacteria

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:22.231
that live in your gut.

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.166
While you eat animal 
flesh every day,

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:28.470
you are summoning up 
bacteria that eat carnitine

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.140
and those bacteria will 
turn that carnitine

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.076
into a molecule 
called trimethylamine.

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:37.580
Your liver then turns that 
into trimethylamine oxide.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.113
That's a molecule from hell.

01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:42.417
That molecule drives cholesterol 
into the artery walls

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:45.386
and the people who are 
consuming this flesh-based diet

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:47.756
are tripping to 
plaque building up.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:50.059
They may lose weight on 
this diet and that's good

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:53.462
but what's happening inside 
your arteries paleo friends?

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.698
What's happening is that 
plaque is building up

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:58.399
and these are folks who 
drop dead at the gym at 39.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.536
Boo, he was lean and 
he looked really good

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.770
but where is that 
cholesterol going?

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.305
It's going to your artery walls.

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:08.010
So, I believe in this paleo 
folks are setting themselves up

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:11.913
for an epidemic of clogged 
arteries, colon cancers,

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:15.350
autoimmune diseases, this 
is not a healthy diet.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.219
We are not carnivorous apes.

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:19.455
- [Kip] Humans' closest 
living relatives are chimps

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:21.823
who get 97% of their 
calories from plants

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.493
and the remaining 3% 
mostly from insects.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.795
Comparing the anatomy of 
true omnivores like bears

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:29.765
who eat both meat and plants 
to frugivores like primates

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.734
who eat almost 
exclusively plants,

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.502
the differences 
are pretty clear.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.571
Frugivore teeth have flat 
molars for chewing plants

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.139
where omnivore 
teeth are serrated

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:39.174
for stabbing and tearing flesh.

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:40.676
Frugivore jaws can move forward

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:41.877
and back and side to side.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.879
Omnivore jaws cannot.

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.881
Omnivores have much 
stronger stomach acid

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.349
for digesting meat

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.484
compared to less acidic 
stomach acid of frugivores.

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:52.555
The intestines of frugivores 
is nine times their body length

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.456
compared to three 
times for omnivores.

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.659
This is because meat will 
putrify in the gut less

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.160
as it moved through it quickly.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.629
If humans were indeed true 
omnivores, we would need

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:03.532
to change our physiology 
and appearance quite a lot

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:06.769
but we fit every 
requirement of a frugivore.

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.137
We may behave like omnivores

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.673
but anatomically, 
we're frugivores.

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.908
- Human beings, unlike 
bears and raccoons

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.577
and to some extent dogs,

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:18.280
don't have that mixed 
anatomy and physiology

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.049
that you see in 
the true omnivores

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.151
and thus, we are 
not true omnivores.

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:25.788
In humans, the canines 
have become really small

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:30.025
and rounded and 
actually function like 
accessory incisors.

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.827
They're utterly 
useless for ripping

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:34.229
and tearing anything 
other than the envelope.

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:37.700
So, the idea that the mere 
presence of the canine

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.669
somehow means that 
we're supposed to 
eat meat, it's silly.

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:41.904
- [Kip] He was right.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.339
I always tell my 
canines were from me

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.107
but what kind of animal 
could I actually kill

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:47.776
and eat raw with 
these tiny teeth?

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:49.778
The thought alone 
was disgusting.

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:51.380
- I mean everybody 
loves a smoothie

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.049
made with fruit and 
even some vegetables

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.918
but if you think 
about putting a fish

01:10:55.918 --> 01:11:00.255
or a piece of beef in the 
blender and grinding it up.

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:03.025
The thought is 
absolutely repulsive.

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:04.727
- [Kip] All these 
diseases I'd learned about

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:07.129
were from eating a diet our 
body wasn't designed for.

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:09.031
What would happen if we 
started eating a diet

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:11.400
our body actually 
was designed for?

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.901
- The data is crystal clear

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:15.537
that you can stop and 
reverse heart disease

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:17.039
with plant-based diets.

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:20.142
Scientifically shown, I've 
seen in my own patients.

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:22.311
- People who adopt 
low-fat plant-based diets

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.380
can actually reverse 
their heart disease

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.682
and that literally means 
watching the plaques

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:29.618
start to go away, something 
they didn't think could happen.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:31.253
- My experience with patients is

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:33.022
and the studies show 
that when people adopt

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:35.357
the fully plant-based diet, 
their cholesterol levels

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:36.825
plummet within a few days

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.494
and if you do blood tests 
in a couple of weeks,

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.296
you'll see dramatic 
improvements.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.930
- Yes, your numbers 
are gonna look great

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.198
within a week or two.

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.633
Your cholesterol can 
come crashing down.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.168
In fact, if you're 
on medications,

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.169
your doctor may have to pull off

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:48.737
your blood pressure medications

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:50.472
so your blood pressure 
don't drop too low

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.174
because it can work too good.

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:55.144
The side effect is not 
having to take drugs.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.446
- [Kip] In a groundbreaking 
study published by Dr. Esselstyn

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:00.416
following patients suffering 
from cardiovascular disease,

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:04.520
99.4% were able to avoid 
major cardiac events

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.188
by going plant-based.

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.890
- Because it's not 
just heart disease.

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:10.626
It's hypertension, it's 
diabetes, it's strokes,

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:14.396
it's heart attacks, it's several 
of the autoimmune diseases,

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:17.232
lupus, asthma, 
GERD, osteoporosis.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.303
I mean, there's a 
multitude of diseases.

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:22.638
Even rheumatoid arthritis.

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:23.906
It's gonna be so dramatic.

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.407
When you see these poor souls

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.443
who are just absolutely crippled

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.445
with rheumatoid 
arthritis go plant-based,

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.347
then they come off 
their medication.

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:34.083
- I wanted to follow 
up with Jane Chapman

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.418
who had been suffering 
if severe osteoarthritis,

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:39.788
and I could not believe what 
I saw after only a few weeks

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:42.324
of fasting and 
changing her diet.

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:44.126
- So amazing to 
see you like this--

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.627
- I know. (laughs) 
- Only a few weeks later.

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:49.031
- I know, from going 
from the walker,

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:52.401
needing wheelchair 
assistance at the airport

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:55.270
to strolling down the street,

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:59.308
enjoying the fresh air 
and the sunshine...

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:02.811
Two weeks is all it took, two 
weeks to get off all the meds

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:06.148
and start to feel 
the inflammation

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:08.817
just drained out of the body

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:11.754
where the movement 
was much easier,

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:15.891
just a lot of healing 
occurred very rapidly

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.393
just by doing the right 
things for your body.

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:21.530
- When you're treating 
diseases with drugs,

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.432
there's one drug you 
take for cholesterol,

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.901
a different class of drugs to 
take for high blood pressure,

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:28.237
different class of drugs 
you take for diabetes,

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.272
but with diet, a 
plant-based diet,

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:34.510
affects all these diseases, 
one diet rules them all.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:35.844
- [Kip] The impacts 
of eating this way

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.146
go far beyond ourselves.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:39.014
By getting rid of 
heart disease alone,

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:42.084
we would save up to 48 
trillion dollars in the USA,

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.553
three times the US GDP.

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.054
- Conditions like 
high blood pressure,

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.690
you don't have to take the 
drugs for rest of your life

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:50.192
and be sick forever.

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.161
What you can do is live in 
such a way that it gives

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.862
the body a chance 
to heal itself.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:57.399
We took 174 consecutive patients 
with high blood pressure

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:59.601
and 174 people 
were able to lower

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.836
their blood pressure enough

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.638
to eliminate the 
need for medication.

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:05.040
- For inflammatory bowel 
disease like Crohn's,

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.709
the best remission 
rates ever achieved

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:10.445
through plant-based diet, 
MS, multiple sclerosis.

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:13.115
The best results ever 
achieved compared

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.517
to any medical-surgical, 
any kind of intervention,

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.019
was a plant-based diet.

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.321
- You can see that with 
every sequential reduction

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:22.024
in animal products, 
people live longer,

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:24.026
they have less heart disease, 
they have less cancer,

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.327
they have less diabetes.

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.995
- You can actually 
take human cancer cells

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.263
and put 'em in a Petri dish,

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:30.232
you can drip the blood 
of those eating vegan,

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:33.001
get about 72% suppression

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:36.038
in human prostate cancer 
cell growth in vitro.

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:39.107
They want to try this again 
with women in breast cancer,

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.709
said, "Let's see what a 
plant-based diet can do."

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:43.245
After just two weeks, 
their bodies cleaned up.

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:46.448
You drip their blood on the 
same carpet of cancer cells,

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:48.250
you can clear off 
the whole plate.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.319
This is after just two 
weeks eating healthy

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.587
which raised the question,

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.488
what kind of blood do 
we want in our bodies?

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:56.892
- My background is in industrial 
and systems engineering

01:14:56.892 --> 01:15:00.395
and that was my career 
path for a long time

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:03.165
until I had thyroid cancer

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:06.568
and everything 
changed from there.

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:10.739
I decided that I wanted 
to try alternative methods

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.009
and treatments rather 
than have surgery

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:15.811
and have my thyroid removed

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.079
which meant I'd be 
on medication forever

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:18.614
and didn't want that.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.583
I just started reading 
into how plant-based diet

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:25.120
can heal the body and it has 
worked for so many people.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.089
So, I immediately just switched

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:30.759
to a completely whole 
food plant-based diet.

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:33.929
After a year, the cancer 
was completely gone

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:37.032
and my thyroid had 
shrunk to normal size

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:40.035
and I was completely 
free of that.

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.536
- [Kip] This was 
tough to believe.

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:43.438
Couldn't this all just be 
from eating healthier though

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:44.873
like no sugar?

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.409
Turns out, Dr. Walter 
Kempner from Duke University

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:49.811
back in the 1940's 
was reversing some

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:52.481
of our worst killer 
diseases with diet alone

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:53.649
and the diet he was using

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:55.550
was not always 
strictly plant-based

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:59.621
but it was made up of white 
rice, fruit, and table sugar.

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.423
- And he was reversing diabetes,

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.592
he was reversing 
malignant hypertension,

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:06.728
reversing heart disease, 
the diabetic complications,

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.997
reversing diabetic blindness.

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:11.133
So, these people basically 
had death sentences,

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:14.069
went to him, and were 
given basically sugar.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.204
You know, this horrible diet

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:19.207
but it was strictly plant-based.

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.642
- [Kip] If this 
information had been around

01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:23.879
since the 1940's, why don't 
all doctors know this?

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.047
- We're not taught 
about the power

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:27.516
of food in medical school.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:31.153
No one is taught that 
the changes that we make

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:34.489
with our diet are probably 
the single most powerful thing

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:36.692
we can do to 
determine our destiny.

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.327
It trumps our genetics.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.928
- Why isn't your 
doctor telling this?

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:42.531
Odds are your doctor never 
learned any of these.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:43.832
In fact, there is even 
a bill introduced,

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:45.167
just mandating physicians

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:47.102
to get seven hours 
of nutrition training

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:49.771
every couple of years just 
kinda stay on top of it

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:52.808
and who came out against that?

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:54.343
The California 
Medical Association.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:56.078
Even the family 
physicians, the surgeons,

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:59.348
all the mainstream medical 
groups came out opposed.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.483
- If seven hours, that's a lot.

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.752
Even if it's over 
one for your period.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.687
- So, they're not just neutral

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:09.291
but they actually actively 
opposing nutrition education.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.293
- Ironically, when patients 
come to doctors with questions,

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:14.029
they assume that the doctor 
knows something about nutrition

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:16.198
and so, it's kind of a 
double whammy that doctors

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.833
haven't been taught 
much about nutrition.

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:19.801
- [Kip] Why don't we hear 
about this from dieticians

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:22.170
where nutrition is 
their entire specialty?

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.473
Turns out, the 
American Nutrition and 
Dietetics Association

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.208
puts out a nutrition 
facts sheets

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.043
written by the 
industries themselves.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.512
The industries pay 
$20,000 per fact sheet

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:32.848
and explicitly take 
part in writing them.

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:34.516
So, you can learn about 
eggs from the egg industry.

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:37.252
You can learn about lamb 
from the lamb industry.

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.454
This would be like learning 
about the benefits of smoking

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.189
from the tobacco industry.

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:42.858
- When people are eating meat,

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.726
I think of it as a 
bit like smoking.

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:46.828
It's sort of Russian Roulette.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.330
You may not get diabetes

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.433
but your chances of getting 
diabetes, about one in three.

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:53.001
You may not get cancer 
but your chances

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.937
if you're a man, about one in 
two, a woman, one in three.

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:58.106
Your chances of gaining 
weight, two out of three.

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.142
It's not all diet 
but most of it is.

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:01.977
The best thing that 
you can do to make sure

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:05.080
that you empty those 
bullets out of the chamber

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.715
and not taking risk 
with your health,

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:08.984
is to get the animal 
products out of your diet

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:11.286
and eat healthy foods.

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:14.122
- I came to TrueNorth to 
help me with my asthma

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:16.658
and to lose a little 
weight and it's amazing,

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:18.727
just in two weeks 
of changing my diet,

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:22.431
don't have to take 
any asthma medication,

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:26.468
no anti-depressants, 
no pain medication,

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:30.572
no heart medication, nothing, 
no medications at all.

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:33.942
And it's really, 
it's just incredible.

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:37.345
I was taking Oxy 
and Advil and...

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:40.215
I was taking 800 milligrams 
of Motrin three times a day

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.017
just to get through the day

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:43.819
because I was in so much pain.

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.454
And now, nothing.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.455
- Wow. 
- Nothing at all.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:47.289
- Two weeks?

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:48.890
- Two weeks, 14 days.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:49.858
- So, you're taking 
all that medication,

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.259
you're completely off?

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:52.961
- Completely off everything.

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.563
It's just been so 
frustrating to me

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:58.600
because I went to so many 
different doctors for help

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.403
and I tried so many 
different medications

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:04.272
to help me with my 
asthma and nothing helped

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:07.209
and I was stuck on the couch 
for the last 10 months,

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:11.046
unable to breathe, and 
now, in two weeks time,

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:15.350
14 days, I'm off my medication.

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:18.887
And I can breathe and I 
feel good, and I can walk.

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.990
My life has changed 
and I took two weeks

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:24.159
of a whole plant-based diet.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:25.393
- [Kip] That's incredible.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:26.228
- Yeah.

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:28.530
- That was incredible.

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.932
- (laughs) It really is. 
- That sounds amazing.

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.167
- I know, it really is.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:35.871
I feel so blessed and so 
good and just so happy

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.274
to be doing this and I'm hoping

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.309
that I can be a role 
model for other people

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.378
and not be pushy about it

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:48.416
because everyone's gonna 
do it in their own time.

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:50.752
But think on my time is now.

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:54.656
- [Kip] That's incredible.

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.091
- Thanks, thanks.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.562
- [Kip] As powerful 
as Amy's story was,

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:03.265
I knew for some, 
eating 100% plant-based

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.000
would still seem extreme.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.802
- I think, there's the 
sense that everything's okay

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:10.071
in moderation, right?

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:14.342
But we haven't seen 
that moderation works.

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:15.710
There really isn't 
a study that shows

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:18.446
that by eating meat 
and eggs in moderation,

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:20.182
you can actually turn 
your heart disease around

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.650
and get better.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:22.851
- [Kip] But I know people 
who have given up meat

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.319
and they felt sick.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.755
- It's unlikely that 
anybody's symptoms

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:29.658
are caused by a dead 
decaying flesh deficiency.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:32.894
The lack of highly processed 
animal food products

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.996
in the diet is not 
gonna be associated

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:37.332
with the causal factor 
about why there is that.

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:39.367
There is gonna be a reason 
why they're not feeling well

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:40.835
but that's not gonna 
be one of them.

01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:42.704
- So, I've had people go 
vegan and they come back to me

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.339
and they're like, 
"I'm hypothyroid

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:45.874
"and my doctor says 
I'm hypothyroid

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:50.445
"because plant-based diet 
makes you hypothyroid."

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:52.280
I'm like, so, what is 
your doctor tell all

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.115
his meat-eaters that 
are hypothyroid?

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.784
- [Kip] What was in 
animal flesh or dairy

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:58.553
that you can't get 
in plant-based?

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:02.057
- Cholesterol, heterocyclic 
amines, E-coli.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:04.960
You know, if you think about it,

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.729
there is nothing in 
an animal-based diet

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:10.932
that you can't get in the 
healthier form somewhere else.

01:21:10.932 --> 01:21:13.535
- I think, only other 
vitamin is vitamin B12,

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.737
it's not made by plants, 
not made by animals either,

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:17.772
made by a little microbes 
that blanket the earth.

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:20.542
Because the way we live 
in unsanitized world,

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.645
unless you're eating 
bacteria-contaminated foods,

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.547
we need to get a source 
of B12 from somewhere,

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:28.316
so, the healthiest, 
cheapest, safest source

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.685
is getting vitamin 
B12 fortified food

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:32.020
or vitamin B12 supplement,

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.022
not to get it from 
meat and dairy.

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.523
- [Kip] What about people 
who say they have to eat meat

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:38.827
for their blood 
type or their genes?

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:41.796
- It's like, "I need meat 
because I'm a Capricorn,"

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.298
"I need meat 'cause I 
have an A plus blood."

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:44.399
It's like, what do you say?

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:46.201
No one has to eat meat.

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.303
There's not vitamin, 
mineral, nutrient

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:51.973
that you can't get from 
non-animal sources.

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:55.210
- Valentine's Day, I've 
decided to go vegan

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:58.480
and give up all 
meat, which was never

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.715
in my thoughts in a 
while, million years,

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:04.119
but I've heard so much success 
from people that are vegan.

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:07.188
So, I gave up all animal 
product whatsoever,

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:11.359
I've lost 29 pounds, I've been 
able to cut my med in half.

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:14.663
I've been able to cut 
my insulin in half

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:16.698
and now, I'm going for the moon.

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.233
I'm gonna go cut it all out.

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:21.236
In the last six weeks, we've 
just had three grandchildren

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:23.271
and my ugly face 
is gonna be around

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:25.807
to see them graduate from 
high school and college.

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.075
I'm gonna be here.

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.610
- My mission is to 
let everybody know

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:32.647
you do not have to suffer 
from diabetes and cancer,

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:34.949
and heart disease because 
someone in your family had it

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:36.618
or because the doctors 
are telling you,

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.486
this is what's gonna happen.

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:40.255
You can take charge 
of your health

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:43.825
and have a positive 
outcome just like I did.

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:46.761
The reason I'm so 
committed to this is...

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.830
My grandmother had diabetes,

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:53.468
and I didn't know what I know 
now about healing the body

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:55.970
and if I did, I feel 
like she could've lived

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.839
at least a few years longer.

01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:59.574
So, it's in her honor

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:03.511
that I do what I do

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.246
'cause I can save someone 
else's grandmother,

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:08.583
aunt, uncle, father 
from that, you know.

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:13.288
So, (sighs)

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:18.326
so, I'm excited about getting 
the message out there.

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:19.427
- [Kip] There's a common belief

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.463
that eating plant-based 
is expensive.

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:22.731
- Not at all.

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:25.734
It can be done in a 
very inexpensive way

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:28.103
where you buy foods 
that are in season

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:32.173
and you shop in the bulk bins 
and that saves a lot of money.

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:35.043
You can eliminate a 
lot of your expenses

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:38.179
on your grocery bill by 
not buying meat and dairy

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:40.348
because these things 
are expensive.

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:42.550
Our meal plan for 
a family of four

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:45.453
is $25 per person in the family.

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.288
- 20.64 is your total.

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:49.858
- [Kip] 20.64, whoa!

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.226
That's her entire week of food.

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.660
- [Cashier] Really?

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.329
- [Kip] An exploding 
movement of elite athletes

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:56.531
are utilizing vegan 
diets to heal injuries,

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:59.801
speed recovery times and 
enhance their performance.

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.069
- Before I was vegan,

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:04.539
I was only benchpressing 
315 like five times.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:05.807
Then, after going vegan,

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.976
I was doing 400, 425, 465.

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:11.946
And I was like, oh my 
god, this is amazing.

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:15.016
I'm vegan and I'm 
benchpressing 465 pounds.

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:16.184
This is ridiculous.

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:17.452
And as soon as I went vegan,

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:19.154
tendonitis started disappearing.

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:21.322
My strength in my right 
arm start coming back.

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:23.024
High blood pressure 
was going down.

01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:26.761
You can't be strong and 
be dying on the hindsight,

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:29.964
that's not strong, that's 
weak, that's really weak

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:32.000
because you look big and 
strong in the outside,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.170
yeah, big man, no, but your 
heart's crying for help.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.338
On the inside, you're dying.

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.441
- I'm a professional 
parkour athlete,

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:40.942
two-time world 
freerunning champion.

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.744
More recently, I got 
into Ninja Warrior

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:43.912
where I'm captain of Team Europe

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.448
as we won USA versus the world.

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:49.050
For something like Ninja Warrior 
and parkour specifically,

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:52.287
you really need to have good 
strength to body weight ratio.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:54.222
So, I was carrying massive, 
I really didn't need

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:56.458
and when I went vegan, 
I lost 15, 20 pounds,

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.460
I was more agile, I 
was more efficient,

01:24:58.460 --> 01:24:59.994
and more stamina in my body,

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:01.863
just that extra bit of pop 
that I didn't have before,

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.598
it just gave that 
extra strength.

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.867
This is a very 
vibrant way to live.

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:07.802
It can enhance 
you as an athlete.

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:10.605
For me, 100% better 
athlete than I was before.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:13.074
It unlocks a whole new 
chapter of my training.

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:14.509
The science is that, 
the health is that

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:15.743
the athletes, they're 
proving that you don't need

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:18.913
to eat dead animals to 
be strong to be healthy.

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:21.616
- I started working out 
when I was 47 years old.

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:25.086
All that muscles you 
see, I gained as vegan,

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:27.655
I gained 15 pounds of 
muscles on my body.

01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:29.657
Eating all plant-based 
vegan foods.

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:33.561
All the aches and pains in 
my body, it just went away

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:37.098
because I'm not ingesting 
so many inflamed foods,

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:39.334
the acidic foods that 
animal products are.

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:41.002
Gorillas, rhinos, and elephants,

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:44.939
they all get their muscles and 
strength from eating plants.

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.341
That's what I do.

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:49.444
- I travel all around 
the world for my surfing

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:51.880
and I've always been 
able to eat vegan.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.415
I feel like if you 
want something,

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:55.650
then you can make it happen.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.285
I just don't make any excuses.

01:25:57.285 --> 01:26:00.321
I would never not be vegan now 
that I know all the benefits

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:02.790
and now that I know how 
it feels to be vegan.

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.726
- Every aspect of my 
life has been improved

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:06.828
by adopting this lifestyle.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:09.631
I feel better, I perform 
better athletically,

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:12.667
I sleep better, my energy 
with my kids is better,

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:15.303
my focus at work is better, 
everything is better.

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:17.572
My skin cleared 
up, cut myself trim

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:19.908
for nine years now doing this.

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:22.243
All I can tell 
you is that I felt

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:26.581
and I continue to feel better 
than I ever felt before.

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:28.383
My friend, Jason Lester 
and I were the first people

01:26:28.383 --> 01:26:31.786
to do this challenge 
called EPIC5

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:33.788
which entail doing five ironmans

01:26:33.788 --> 01:26:36.491
on five Hawaiian 
islands in our group.

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:38.459
An ironman is a 2.4-mile swim

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:40.461
followed by 112-mile bike,

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:44.465
and then running a marathon, 
26.2 miles after that.

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:45.967
So, we did five 
of those in a row

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:49.470
on five different islands 
and in little under a week.

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:50.605
- Yeah, you almost die?

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.340
- Yeah, die.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.541
- So, I guess the 
famous question,

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.310
where did you get your 
protein? (mumbles)

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:59.314
- (laughs) From plants.

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:01.215
- [Kip] Like so many people, 
I was looking for excuses

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.885
not to change my diet 
but once I finally did,

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.420
I felt liberated.

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.789
Within days, I could feel the 
blood running through my veins

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:09.190
with a new vitality.

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.925
Within weeks, I felt 
a transformation

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:13.328
throughout my entire 
body and mind.

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:16.564
Not only could I survive on a 
purely plant-based vegan diet,

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:19.100
I could thrive, I felt amazing.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.070
I competed my first 
marathon in six years

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.304
training half the amount

01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:25.873
and beat my personal 
record by 23 minutes.

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:29.143
Less than a month later, I 
did my first full ironman.

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:30.545
Although I could 
possibly get away

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:32.280
with eating a little 
bit of meat and dairy

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.415
without ill effects 
to my personal health,

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:36.351
I could no longer willingly 
support an industry

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:39.020
I knew was causing so much 
suffering to communities,

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.823
families, and all 
life on the planet.

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:45.126
A whole new world opened 
up, I felt whole again,

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:47.862
connected to a greater 
sense of what true health is

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:50.298
and where true health 
doesn't end with me

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.866
but begins with us.

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.903
- If people adopted 
a plant-based diet,

01:27:55.903 --> 01:28:00.842
the changes we would see 
in our individual health,

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:02.810
in our national 
health situation,

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:06.047
and in this physical 
environmental world we live in

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:08.316
would be so profound.

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:11.019
- I mean, today, you can say,

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:13.054
"I'm not gonna eat 
that stuff anymore.

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:16.691
"It's one thing that I 
can do myself personally

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:18.092
"to make a difference."

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:19.627
- It will give you a 
greater sense of well-being

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:22.030
and happiness when 
you know that one,

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.698
you're not destroying 
your health

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:24.932
every time you sit down to eat,

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.668
you're not promoting cruelty,

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:28.302
and you're not 
damaging the Earth.

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:30.171
- I don't want my gains 
to be at the detriment

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.706
of the planet of other things

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.641
and yet, I'm not 
weaker, I'm stronger.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:34.909
That's the beauty of it.

01:28:34.909 --> 01:28:36.144
When you all twist and 
when you make choices

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.912
for the great good of 
others, it comes around,

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:39.781
benefits as well, 
benefits us all.

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:42.150
- Studies show that 
we cannot only survive

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.384
but we can thrive.

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:45.987
- I just feel this is 
a great way to live.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.622
Not harm the other beings

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:49.924
when we can be 
healthy and happier.

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:52.860
I love it, it's a great life.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:56.097
- I never thought that I could 
feel this good at this age

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:58.433
and I just want everybody 
to feel this way.

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:01.202
I feel like a 20-year-old, 
I'm almost 50.

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:04.839
- Nothing tastes as good as 
health, it feels basically.

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:07.108
- And so, the choices that 
we make every single day,

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:09.310
day in and day out 
around our food

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:13.448
has the capacity to bring us 
true health, optimal wellness,

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:16.150
not just individually 
but collectively

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:18.586
as species and for our planet.

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.922
- We're not gonna live forever

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:23.491
but while we are alive, 
we can live well.

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:26.027
And, for me, as a doctor, 
that's what I wanna see.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:29.697
- Where there's a 
will, there is a way,

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:31.265
and I believe that.

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:36.204
(uplifting Mexican guitar music)

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:31.559
(singing in foreign language)

01:30:32.305 --> 01:30:38.609
