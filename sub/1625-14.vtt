WEBVTT

00:02.021 --> 00:03.405
Can I get another refill?

00:03.627 --> 00:05.460
Yes.
Can I get an explanation

00:05.462 --> 00:08.514
of why you're wearing overalls
when there are no goats around?

00:11.685 --> 00:14.686
Oh, wait...
Now he's drumming.

00:14.998 --> 00:16.939
Overalls, free coffee refills,
and drumming.

00:17.441 --> 00:20.258
We can stop looking, we found
the world's most annoying hipster.

00:21.090 --> 00:23.261
Max, this isn't a diner
where everything comes

00:23.263 --> 00:24.813
with attitude and E. coli.

00:25.065 --> 00:28.398
This is the cupcake shop.
You own this place.

00:28.485 --> 00:31.818
Ugh, success really
cuts your balls off!

00:36.660 --> 00:38.960
We get it.
Your tribe's in trouble.

00:40.162 --> 00:41.797
Hey, she's kidding.

00:41.799 --> 00:44.299
Just help yourself to a fresh
mocha almond refill.

00:44.301 --> 00:46.835
And by the way, sick beats.

00:48.704 --> 00:50.371
You threw him a peace sign?

00:50.373 --> 00:52.974
What are you, a Japanese teenager?

00:52.976 --> 00:54.843
It's a gesture of goodwill.

00:54.845 --> 00:58.178
Okay, but if I see you doing
an open heart, I will kill you.

00:59.316 --> 01:01.500

01:16.134 --> 01:17.586
Hey, there's Andy.

01:18.998 --> 01:20.521
I don't want him to see me.

01:21.023 --> 01:23.856
Did you just openly wave
to my ex-boyfriend?

01:24.644 --> 01:26.060
Yeah, I always wave at him.

01:26.062 --> 01:27.278
He didn't die just because

01:27.280 --> 01:29.897
you stopped letting him touch
your boobies.

01:31.149 --> 01:33.150
Well, I don't wave
to the guy at the record shop

01:33.152 --> 01:34.368
that you had sex with.

01:34.370 --> 01:37.703
I had sex with the guy
at the record shop?

01:38.624 --> 01:40.374
I should keep a diary.

01:40.376 --> 01:42.326
Oh, God, he's coming back.

01:42.328 --> 01:43.911
See what you started with your wave?

01:43.913 --> 01:46.196
I'm sorry.
My hand is friendly.

01:46.198 --> 01:48.716
Ask any guy in high school.

01:49.218 --> 01:51.018
I was gonna try and sneak by,

01:51.020 --> 01:53.337
but that just seemed
so juvenile, so here...

01:54.339 --> 01:55.539
"Do you guys still like me?

01:55.541 --> 01:58.874
"Check 'Yes' or 'No.'"

01:59.211 --> 02:00.478
So how's she doing?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.713
- She's good.
- Really?

02:03.215 --> 02:06.048
Oh, by the way, the guy
at the record store says hi.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.485
Well, you tell him
I said, "who are you?"

02:12.224 --> 02:13.808
And I also came in because
I wanted to make sure

02:13.810 --> 02:15.225
everything's cool with you and me, Max.

02:15.227 --> 02:17.027
I mean, you haven't texted me a pic

02:17.029 --> 02:19.229
of an unlikely animal friendship
in, like, 48 hours.

02:19.231 --> 02:21.198
Don't worry, we're cool.
I just haven't been able

02:21.200 --> 02:22.783
to top the picture I sent of the monkey

02:22.785 --> 02:25.002
tickling a parrot.

02:25.004 --> 02:26.504
I get it.
You have high standards.

02:26.506 --> 02:28.906
Whereas, me, I see a black dog
spooning a brown dog,

02:28.908 --> 02:30.541
and I pull the trigger.

02:30.543 --> 02:32.710
Well, save that amateur crap
for your mom,

02:32.712 --> 02:34.912
perhaps with an aunt and uncle CC.

02:34.914 --> 02:36.630
Ha, that is so me.

02:36.632 --> 02:38.382
Well, sir, you have raised the bar.

02:38.384 --> 02:41.717
I look forward to our next
freaky/adorable animal pic.

02:43.222 --> 02:45.222
Well, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

02:45.224 --> 02:48.557
Since we broke up, he got fat.

02:49.762 --> 02:52.095
It's only been four days.

02:52.097 --> 02:54.815
Wynonna Judd gets fat in an hour.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.935
I'm too exhausted
to even think about Andy.

02:57.937 --> 03:00.237
Let's just change and get to the diner.

03:00.239 --> 03:01.322
Look, all we have to do is make it

03:01.324 --> 03:02.456
through eight more hours,

03:02.458 --> 03:05.709
and then we can get
a good night's sleep.

03:05.711 --> 03:08.946
Max, you're taking
your pants off in public!

03:08.948 --> 03:10.714
Oh, my God!

03:10.716 --> 03:14.049
I'm so tired, I forgot where I was!

03:14.387 --> 03:17.104
They're halfway down.
What do I do?

03:17.606 --> 03:20.439
I'm too tired to make the call.

03:24.062 --> 03:27.395
And I'll have the BLT
with the French fries.

03:27.396 --> 03:30.649
Miss? I think our waitress
is asleep.

03:31.821 --> 03:33.404
Yeah, she's tired.
We haven't slept a lot lately.

03:33.406 --> 03:34.888
When she wakes up,
she'll take your order.

03:34.890 --> 03:37.024
- But we're really hungry--
- Leave her alone!

03:37.026 --> 03:40.344
So I come to your job and wake you up?

03:40.596 --> 03:43.113
Hi, can I take your order?

03:43.115 --> 03:45.666
I can see how tired you are, Max.

03:45.668 --> 03:48.318
And if I could turn the clock
back to '75,

03:48.320 --> 03:51.653
I'd help you out
with a nice bump of cocaine.

03:51.824 --> 03:53.457
But I don't do that anymore.

03:53.459 --> 03:55.993
Earl, you quit coke in 1975?

03:55.995 --> 03:59.328
No, when I was 75, last year.

03:59.715 --> 04:03.048
It just felt like time.

04:03.135 --> 04:06.468
Now all I can give you is
a nice bump of this.

04:07.106 --> 04:09.290
Max, I need you
to explain something to me

04:09.292 --> 04:10.674
'cause I can't figure it out.

04:10.676 --> 04:14.009
That's hard to believe,
since you're 90% head.

04:14.814 --> 04:16.480
It's not a laughing matter, Max.

04:16.482 --> 04:19.815
I broke my mother's pelvis coming out.

04:23.038 --> 04:26.371
At least you finally came out.

04:28.359 --> 04:30.878
Oh, so you're awake enough
to ridicule the boss,

04:30.880 --> 04:32.796
but not awake enough to wait on tables.

04:32.798 --> 04:36.131
Exactly. See,
there's that big head working.

04:36.385 --> 04:37.835
And don't exaggerate.

04:37.837 --> 04:39.970
Caroline and I are doing a great job.

04:39.972 --> 04:43.305
- Wake up.
- Hi, can I take your order?

04:43.726 --> 04:45.759
All I knows is.
if I was doing my job

04:45.761 --> 04:48.512
as bad as you two tonight,
I'd take my own life.

04:48.514 --> 04:51.847
That's not off the table.

04:52.384 --> 04:53.701
Come on, Han, cut us a break.

04:53.703 --> 04:55.986
We're working two jobs,
we got two hours of sleep.

04:55.988 --> 04:58.188
We just want to get home
and climb into bed.

04:58.190 --> 05:01.523
You're sleeping together?

05:01.777 --> 05:05.110
I mean, it's been a "will they
or won't they" since they met.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.584
Hi, everybody.
Sophie's here!

05:10.586 --> 05:13.919
And look at my new coat.
It's double-breasted.

05:15.508 --> 05:18.392
Pretty nice, huh?
It was a gift from me.

05:18.394 --> 05:20.077
It's the only thing he ever gave me

05:20.079 --> 05:23.412
that didn't threaten
my reproductive health.

05:23.883 --> 05:25.683
Think that fox took its own life

05:25.685 --> 05:28.519
when it saw what kind of coat
it was gonna be on.

05:28.521 --> 05:30.187
What is the occasion?

05:30.189 --> 05:33.522
What is the occasion?
I'm hot and it's cold.

05:34.926 --> 05:37.644
And it's also the anniversary
of the first time

05:37.646 --> 05:39.980
Oleg and I 70ed.

05:39.982 --> 05:43.315
The way I do it, it's one more than 69.

05:48.990 --> 05:51.959
Max, I just hung up
from a very panicked phone call,

05:51.961 --> 05:53.794
and you'll never believe what happened.

05:53.796 --> 05:55.412
The guy from the record store
called to say

05:55.414 --> 05:57.998
I have super gonorrhea?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.333
You actually think a guy
that you don't even remember

06:01.721 --> 06:05.054
called to tell me
that you have super gonorrhea?

06:06.074 --> 06:08.926
Yes, that's how tired I am.

06:08.928 --> 06:11.729
Are you gonna make me wait
forever? Do I have it or not?

06:11.731 --> 06:15.064
It's not super gonorrhea,
but it is super-bad news.

06:15.401 --> 06:17.151
This woman just called
to confirm her order

06:17.153 --> 06:19.069
for 1,000 cupcakes for tomorrow.

06:19.071 --> 06:21.638
I've been so tired,
I completely forgot.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.973
I'd rather have super gonorrhea!

06:25.161 --> 06:28.245
Are you insane? We can't do
1,000 cupcakes by tomorrow.

06:28.247 --> 06:29.479
We <i>have</i> to do it.

06:29.481 --> 06:31.448
It'll ruin our reputation if we don't.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.867
I know we're tired,
but if we stay up all night,

06:33.869 --> 06:36.820
we'll have $4,000
by tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

06:36.822 --> 06:38.822
They have to be done
by 10:00 a.m.?

06:38.824 --> 06:42.157
I'm so tired, remind me--
Is a.m. the morning one?

06:42.995 --> 06:44.711
We can't do it.
It's impossible.

06:44.713 --> 06:46.680
My brain's too foggy
to crunch the numbers,

06:46.682 --> 06:48.766
but I'm sure it's doable
if we leave right now.

06:48.768 --> 06:50.434
We're in the middle of waiting tables.

06:50.436 --> 06:52.519
Well, we'll just have to
come up with an excuse.

06:52.521 --> 06:55.522
Give me your hand, bend over,
and pretend to be sick.

06:55.524 --> 06:58.008
It'll work. I've used this
to get out of eight jobs,

06:58.010 --> 07:01.343
six final exams, and one wedding.

07:01.981 --> 07:03.831
Han, we have an emergency.
Caroline's sick.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.016
She's so sick, she can't even stand up.

07:06.018 --> 07:07.651
We won't be able to stay
and finish our shift.

07:07.653 --> 07:09.153
We have to go right
to the emergency room.

07:10.856 --> 07:12.456
We don't know what's wrong with her,

07:12.458 --> 07:13.523
but it's coming out of both ends.

07:13.525 --> 07:15.375
It might be super gonorrhea.
Bye.

07:20.464 --> 07:22.365
That's so unfortunate.

07:22.367 --> 07:25.700
And on the night they were
finally gonna do it.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:35.164 --> 07:37.482
Whoa, those are some
big-ass coffees!

07:37.484 --> 07:39.701
Yep, 64-ouncers.

07:39.703 --> 07:42.003
They told me they're bigger
than the human stomach.

07:42.005 --> 07:43.455
And the coffee's already working,

07:43.457 --> 07:44.956
'cause I figured out
if it's midnight now,

07:44.958 --> 07:46.341
we have to be done
at 10:00 a.m.

07:46.343 --> 07:48.360
So if it's 40 minutes per batch
from beginning to end,

07:48.362 --> 07:50.579
baking 4 dozen at a time,
that's 48 cupcakes

07:50.581 --> 07:52.247
times 20 trips to the oven,
which equals nine hours,

07:52.249 --> 07:54.366
which equals $4,000.

07:54.368 --> 07:57.701
Give me that.
Let's see if I can do math too.

07:59.039 --> 08:00.255
Ask me something.

08:00.507 --> 08:02.007
16 times 12.

08:02.259 --> 08:04.542
I'm just going to enjoy my coffee.

08:04.544 --> 08:06.061
You enjoy, I'll preheat the oven.

08:06.063 --> 08:08.313
- What's the temp?
- 325.

08:08.315 --> 08:09.881
There, that's the coffee talking.

08:14.021 --> 08:16.772
Andy just sent me a picture
of a deer nursing a turtle.

08:16.774 --> 08:18.857
This is why they tell teen turtles

08:18.859 --> 08:20.742
never to post up on Facebook.

08:20.744 --> 08:24.077
Oh, I didn't realize
you two were still texting.

08:24.164 --> 08:25.781
Well, we're mostly
just sending pictures

08:25.783 --> 08:27.565
of unlikely animal friendships.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.785
See, there's a bear napping
with a bunny.

08:29.787 --> 08:31.203
And what's this?

08:31.205 --> 08:33.087
It's a labradoodle
high-fiving a koi fish.

08:33.090 --> 08:34.673
It's pretty self-explanatory.

08:34.674 --> 08:37.876
No, underneath that.
This-- "How's Caroline?"

08:37.878 --> 08:40.379
I thought this was just
an unlikely animal friendship.

08:40.381 --> 08:42.746
It is, mostly, but every other text,

08:42.749 --> 08:44.883
I get the idea that
maybe he's not over you.

08:45.285 --> 08:47.519
He's the one who broke up with <i>me.</i>

08:47.521 --> 08:49.554
Well, maybe he regrets it.

08:49.556 --> 08:52.057
Maybe you two are like
Chris Brown and Rihanna,

08:52.059 --> 08:54.643
minus the punching and the duet.

08:55.345 --> 08:56.528
I'm kind of surprised.

08:56.530 --> 08:58.563
I thought you guys were good together.

08:58.565 --> 09:01.149
Andy is great.
And on the surface,

09:01.151 --> 09:02.934
he was there for me
and very supportive.

09:02.936 --> 09:05.404
But then he kind of got fed up
when it was so much about

09:05.406 --> 09:06.488
me and my career.

09:06.490 --> 09:08.273
And when push came to shove,
he felt like

09:08.275 --> 09:10.992
he had to pull away
for his own well-being.

09:10.994 --> 09:14.327
Oh, my God, we are
Rihanna and Chris Brown!

09:14.448 --> 09:16.748
But I'm Chris Brown.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.583
Speaking of Chris Brown,
I'm gonna start to batter.

09:21.621 --> 09:23.138
How's that stove?

09:23.140 --> 09:25.924
Warm, but it's really wobbly.

09:25.926 --> 09:28.126
Yeah, it wobbles, it smokes,
and one time it burned me.

09:28.128 --> 09:30.512
That's why I nicknamed it
"Mom."

09:30.514 --> 09:32.464
What is this wood thing under the leg?

09:32.466 --> 09:34.182
it's the shim.

09:34.184 --> 09:35.984
I think it's making it worse.

09:35.986 --> 09:37.486
Don't!
That's holding the leg up!

09:37.488 --> 09:40.638
Oh! Aah!

09:41.640 --> 09:43.973
But I guess you figured that out now.

09:44.445 --> 09:46.862
You heard me say it was the <i>shim!</i>

09:46.864 --> 09:48.763
I don't know what a shim is.

09:48.765 --> 09:51.249
I thought it was just
one of those things you say.

09:51.251 --> 09:52.650
What did you think it could be?

09:52.652 --> 09:54.319
I thought it was a cool word blend.

09:54.321 --> 09:57.654
You know, like she/him
for a transsexual--a shim.

09:58.541 --> 10:01.624
You thought a tiny transsexual
was holding up our stove?

10:02.129 --> 10:03.879
Yes, Max, I'm that tired.

10:03.881 --> 10:07.165
I thought a tiny transsexual
was holding up our stove.

10:07.167 --> 10:10.051
This is a disaster, and our oven
at home's too small.

10:10.053 --> 10:12.270
What are we gonna do now?

10:12.972 --> 10:14.105
Oh, good, you're still here.

10:14.107 --> 10:16.224
Don't anybody leave.
Our night just got worse.

10:16.226 --> 10:19.559
Don't come any closer, super gonorrhea!

10:20.413 --> 10:23.346
I'm sorry to say we lied
to get off our shift.

10:23.350 --> 10:25.484
But we have to bake
1,000 cupcakes by tomorrow,

10:25.486 --> 10:27.986
and our oven broke at the shop,
and we need to use yours.

10:27.988 --> 10:30.288
You lied to me,
and now you want a favor?

10:30.290 --> 10:32.657
Yes. Han, we know
it's a big favor,

10:32.659 --> 10:34.359
and it probably looks
even bigger to you,

10:34.361 --> 10:37.629
but I'm sure you can see past our lie.

10:37.631 --> 10:39.364
And if you can't,
you can get up on that chair,

10:39.366 --> 10:42.417
I could put you on our shoulders...

10:42.419 --> 10:45.637
Long story abnormally short,
will you help us?

10:45.639 --> 10:48.972
Well, those 12 short jokes
really primed me.

10:49.226 --> 10:50.392
Fine, you can use the oven

10:50.394 --> 10:52.043
and any of the supplies you need.

10:52.045 --> 10:54.346
Thank you. We really need
to fill this order.

10:54.348 --> 10:57.148
I'll stay and help.
I also had something to fill,

10:57.150 --> 11:00.483
but I'll just text Sophie
and tell her I'm working.

11:00.904 --> 11:02.487
I'll help too.

11:02.489 --> 11:05.056
I can't bake, but I can sit
and lift the spirits.

11:05.058 --> 11:08.391
As long as there are spirits.
It's open bar, right, Han?

11:09.495 --> 11:11.828
Okay, I'm in too.
Earl, make me a sea breeze,

11:12.199 --> 11:13.915
easy on the breezy.

11:14.517 --> 11:16.067
You know, because of my childhood,

11:16.069 --> 11:17.619
I won't be able to process the fact

11:17.621 --> 11:19.204
that you've all just
done something nice for me,

11:19.206 --> 11:22.040
so if I run into you
in ten years and start crying,

11:22.042 --> 11:25.293
this is what it's about.

11:30.869 --> 11:33.119
900 and counting.
Comin' through.

11:33.121 --> 11:34.855
- Where do you want them?
- Put 'em over here,

11:34.857 --> 11:37.824
next to the world's slowest helper.

11:37.826 --> 11:39.559
It took you longer
to make that one cupcake

11:39.561 --> 11:42.629
than it took James Cameron
to make <i>Avatar.</i>

11:43.481 --> 11:45.964
Well, I been doing this
for two minutes,

11:45.967 --> 11:49.300
and I have to say...
Not for me.

11:50.989 --> 11:53.240
But you know what is for me?

11:53.242 --> 11:56.026
Another free cognac.

11:56.028 --> 11:57.977
Ready for another sea breeze, Han?

11:57.979 --> 12:00.080
Not before I get this right.

12:00.082 --> 12:03.116
And you don't want to see me
on two sea breezes.

12:03.118 --> 12:06.451
What happens,
you become Lindsay <i>Llo-Han?</i>

12:06.988 --> 12:10.321
Okay, let me show you how it's done.

12:10.659 --> 12:12.992
There, you feel how that is, Han?

12:12.994 --> 12:16.012
Uh, yes.

12:16.014 --> 12:18.131
Now just squeeze that bag.

12:18.133 --> 12:21.351
Good. Little harder.
Good. Little harder.

12:21.353 --> 12:24.686
Whoa! Oh...

12:24.940 --> 12:28.273
I'm humiliated.

12:30.696 --> 12:32.779
It's okay, Han, it happens
to a lot of guys

12:32.781 --> 12:34.514
their first time.

12:35.316 --> 12:37.400
Get yourself a tissue
and clean yourself off,

12:37.402 --> 12:39.869
like everyone else.

12:39.871 --> 12:42.355
Han, you're off the bag.
I'm moving you to batter.

12:42.357 --> 12:44.240
It's not a demotion, it's just
that you stink at this.

12:44.242 --> 12:45.492
I wanna give you something easier.

12:45.494 --> 12:48.662
Max, you just got that
all over your apron.

12:48.664 --> 12:50.863
I'll wipe it down.
Mine's a mess too.

12:50.865 --> 12:52.365
Ooh, pretty slick move.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.867
You wanna try for my bra next?

12:55.921 --> 12:57.220
Yeah, baby,

12:57.222 --> 13:00.555
I'll take off your bra.

13:01.476 --> 13:04.311
What the hell was that?

13:04.313 --> 13:06.429
What?
It's my guy voice.

13:06.731 --> 13:09.065
That's your go-to
guy voice?

13:09.067 --> 13:12.319
Is his identity being
protected on <i>Dateline?</i>

13:12.321 --> 13:14.938
Well, what's your guy voice like?

13:14.940 --> 13:17.273
I'm doing it right now.

13:20.746 --> 13:22.912
I'm gonna take a quick pee break.

13:22.914 --> 13:26.247
I don't know, I think you might
be making the drinks too strong.

13:26.418 --> 13:28.585
We're not drunk, Oleg, just punchy.

13:28.587 --> 13:31.621
I'm just drunk.

13:35.659 --> 13:38.492
It was so nice of everyone
to stay that long.

13:38.964 --> 13:40.930
Everything's baked except for those.

13:40.932 --> 13:42.882
We've gonna make it, Max.

13:44.753 --> 13:47.220
Andy sent me
a cat and a dolphin kissing.

13:47.222 --> 13:49.389
I hope they go all the way.
I'm dying to see their baby.

13:49.391 --> 13:52.559
A cat-dolphin? Yes!

13:52.561 --> 13:54.411
I don't think that's healthy.

13:54.413 --> 13:55.979
Well, if they're in love,

13:55.981 --> 13:57.697
it's really none of your business.

13:57.699 --> 14:00.533
Why are you texting him
in the middle of the night?

14:00.535 --> 14:03.570
In fact, why is he still up?
Is he talking about me?

14:03.572 --> 14:04.487
You look upset.

14:04.489 --> 14:05.789
Do you want me to stop texting him?

14:05.791 --> 14:08.541
No. It's fine.
It's just I'm tired

14:08.543 --> 14:10.410
and we're almost finished,
and I just wanna go home.

14:10.812 --> 14:12.712
Got it.
I'm so hot.

14:12.714 --> 14:15.048
Let me just get this hair off my neck.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.784
Max, why are you wearing
only one earring?

14:17.786 --> 14:20.136
What are you talking about?
I'm wearing two.

14:20.138 --> 14:23.456
That's weird. Where is it?
Is it in my hair?

14:23.758 --> 14:25.958
- No, no.
- Did it fall down?

14:25.960 --> 14:27.010
Yeah, check your boobs.

14:27.012 --> 14:29.813
That's where you found the remote.

14:29.815 --> 14:32.348
It's not--
it's not anywhere on me.

14:32.350 --> 14:33.800
Well, when's the last time you saw it?

14:33.802 --> 14:35.568
I don't know,
but it couldn't have gone far.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.937
I was in this area
pretty much the whole night.

14:37.939 --> 14:41.272
You mean over the batter?

14:42.143 --> 14:44.143
No, no, no.
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

14:44.145 --> 14:45.495
No, no, no, no, nothing,
nothing, nothing!

14:45.497 --> 14:47.447
No, no, no, no, no!
Nothing, nothing, no!

14:47.449 --> 14:49.499
It's not here, which means

14:49.501 --> 14:51.785
it's in one of those
already-baked cupcakes.

14:51.787 --> 14:55.120
Let's go. We have to start
pulling these apart.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.373
Really? Come on,
don't be ridiculous.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.093
Look, worst-case scenario,
one of the 1,000 cupcakes

15:00.095 --> 15:01.261
has an earring in it.

15:01.263 --> 15:03.379
We'll tell them it's a surprise.

15:03.381 --> 15:06.433
No, the worst-case scenario
is someone bites into it,

15:06.435 --> 15:08.802
rips their lip open, and sues us.

15:08.804 --> 15:11.170
Let them sue us.
We don't have any money.

15:11.172 --> 15:12.856
And that's why we'll go to jail.

15:12.858 --> 15:14.340
Yep, I'll be locked up raw

15:14.342 --> 15:15.859
and forced to be someone's girlfriend.

15:15.861 --> 15:17.444
I mean, I'm a bad girlfriend
out of prison.

15:17.446 --> 15:19.679
It's not gonna be any easier
with big Joan.

15:19.681 --> 15:23.014
Calm down. If we go to prison,
I'll be your girlfriend.

15:23.151 --> 15:24.617
Until someone hotter comes along,

15:24.619 --> 15:26.519
'cause that's the way it goes
in prison.

15:26.521 --> 15:27.871
Start looking.

15:27.873 --> 15:30.824
I am not going to smash 900 cupcakes.

15:30.826 --> 15:32.625
Then we'll just have to start over.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.712
Oh, no, I would rather
hitch a ride West

15:35.714 --> 15:38.030
and become a sister-wife.

15:40.334 --> 15:42.218
This is crazy.
Can't I just text them

15:42.220 --> 15:43.803
and tell them we can't do the job?

15:43.805 --> 15:46.539
No, you can't text them.
We need the money.

15:46.541 --> 15:48.207
And stop with all the texting.

15:48.209 --> 15:49.976
Maybe if you were thinking less
about texting

15:49.978 --> 15:51.344
with my ex-boyfriend,

15:51.346 --> 15:53.763
you wouldn't have lost
your earring in the first place.

15:53.765 --> 15:55.181
You should have just said it.

15:55.183 --> 15:57.684
You have a problem
with me texting Andy.

15:57.686 --> 16:00.019
I do not have a problem with it!

16:00.021 --> 16:02.221
Oh, good, 'cause he's my friend too.

16:02.223 --> 16:04.574
You'd think your loyalty
to your best friend

16:04.576 --> 16:06.392
and business partner
would be more important

16:06.394 --> 16:08.528
than some stupid animal friendship!

16:08.530 --> 16:10.330
I mean...

16:10.332 --> 16:12.031
I'm surprised I even have
to tell you that, Max.

16:12.033 --> 16:13.199
It's kind of girl code.

16:13.201 --> 16:16.534
Oh, I am way to tired
to hear "girl code."

16:17.172 --> 16:19.889
Shut it down.

16:19.891 --> 16:23.224
Girl code, Max.
Girl code.

16:25.096 --> 16:28.429
Shut up, Caroline.
Shut up!

16:30.251 --> 16:32.936
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a response.

16:32.938 --> 16:35.305
Yeah, that was the goal, bitch.

16:35.807 --> 16:37.390
I don't have time for this.

16:37.392 --> 16:39.225
I have to find an earring that you lost

16:39.227 --> 16:41.427
in one of these
thousand cupcakes, bitch!

16:42.379 --> 16:45.962
The thousand cupcakes that
you forgot to tell me about!

16:47.101 --> 16:49.536
And the girl code
means that when a girl

16:49.538 --> 16:50.853
breaks up with someone,

16:50.855 --> 16:52.422
you don't interfere
with their boyfriend,

16:52.424 --> 16:54.924
because she needs some distance!

16:54.926 --> 16:56.776
Well, why didn't you tell me that

16:56.778 --> 17:00.111
when I asked you 14 hours ago?

17:01.632 --> 17:03.965
Hey, Max.
I got your text.

17:04.169 --> 17:06.051
I'm here to help.

17:06.554 --> 17:09.387
Um, that was
a pre-girl-code text.

17:11.509 --> 17:13.092
I thought we maybe needed a backup

17:13.094 --> 17:16.127
after Earl passed up
and I made Han cry.

17:21.285 --> 17:24.367
Andy, on the list of things
I feel guilty about in life,

17:24.806 --> 17:26.489
calling you to help
in the middle of the night

17:26.491 --> 17:27.607
is number two.

17:27.608 --> 17:28.741
It would be number one if I hadn't

17:28.743 --> 17:29.909
pushed that girl down the stairs

17:29.911 --> 17:32.478
to get into the 98 Degrees
concert before her.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.813
Well, it was 98 Degrees.
People had to die.

17:37.919 --> 17:39.586
Okay, let's stop
all this joking and get down

17:39.588 --> 17:40.787
to why I really came here.

17:40.789 --> 17:42.589
Come on, Caroline, love me.

17:43.091 --> 17:45.491
Did you just say, "Caroline, love me"?

17:45.493 --> 17:47.594
No, I said,
"Caroline, glove me."

17:47.596 --> 17:48.761
What kind of loser would say,

17:48.763 --> 17:52.096
"love me"?
Unless you do.

17:55.686 --> 17:57.103
So how you doing?

17:57.105 --> 18:00.438
I'm okay.
A little tired.

18:00.675 --> 18:03.059
You know, I've been
thinking about you a lot.

18:03.061 --> 18:05.528
Pretty much all the time
since we broke up.

18:05.530 --> 18:08.114
Um, maybe I overreacted to your whole

18:08.116 --> 18:10.349
obsession with work thing, you know?

18:10.751 --> 18:12.619
- Well, you are here
at 4:00 a.m.

18:12.621 --> 18:15.488
'Cause I needed help making
1,000 cupcakes in four hours.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.457
One might call that obsessive.

18:17.759 --> 18:20.792
One might.
Or pretty much everyone might.

18:21.713 --> 18:25.046
And, Andy, just know that
even though it didn't work out,

18:26.751 --> 18:29.919
I do <i>glove</i> you.

18:29.921 --> 18:32.088
I glove you too.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.641
Now, get the cupcakes out
before they burn.

18:34.643 --> 18:36.375
I don't have the energy
to do this all again.

18:36.377 --> 18:39.710
Ah, there's the girl I broke up with.

18:39.881 --> 18:41.764
Everything's ready to go out there.

18:41.766 --> 18:43.266
I've had my hands in more boxes tonight

18:43.268 --> 18:46.436
than a gynecologist at a free clinic.

18:50.525 --> 18:52.391
It's not <i>that</i> funny.

18:52.393 --> 18:54.327
Stay up another 27 hours,

18:54.329 --> 18:56.579
it'll be the funniest damn thing
you ever heard.

18:59.250 --> 19:00.867
Well, that's the end of it.

19:00.869 --> 19:02.401
Yeah, I think it is.

19:02.403 --> 19:04.871
Max, I'm talking about more
than the cupcakes.

19:04.873 --> 19:08.206
Yeah, I could tell
by your Bradley Cooper tone.

19:08.209 --> 19:10.076
So what, it's not gonna work out
between you two?

19:10.078 --> 19:12.762
No. And I think
we have to break up.

19:12.764 --> 19:14.213
I thought you already broke up.

19:14.215 --> 19:16.082
No, I'm talking about you and me.

19:16.084 --> 19:17.884
You're dumping <i>me?</i>

19:17.886 --> 19:19.352
Wow, last guy who dumped me,

19:19.354 --> 19:21.804
I burned down his house and moved.

19:21.806 --> 19:23.923
Still wanna continue this conversation?

19:23.925 --> 19:25.224
Max, it wouldn't work.

19:25.226 --> 19:27.093
I would always be asking you
about Caroline.

19:27.095 --> 19:28.778
Look, I get it, it's weird.

19:28.780 --> 19:31.230
People don't usually stay
friends with their friend's ex,

19:31.232 --> 19:34.565
but then, cats don't usually
become friends with dolphins.

19:35.453 --> 19:38.604
But sometimes, for no
apparent reason, it happens.

19:38.606 --> 19:40.540
Yeah, I just wish I was as grown up

19:40.542 --> 19:42.408
as a cat or a dolphin.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.293
I hear ya.

19:44.295 --> 19:45.962
So what's next, breakup text?

19:45.964 --> 19:48.164
Nah, that's just gonna lead
to makeup text,

19:48.166 --> 19:50.717
and then we're back in a vicious cycle.

19:51.119 --> 19:52.618
All right, I'll just
stop by your place,

19:52.620 --> 19:54.003
pick up my CDs,
my T-shirts,

19:54.005 --> 19:55.421
and the 3 grand I left there.

19:55.423 --> 19:57.090
Max, you've never been to my place.

19:57.092 --> 19:59.175
See, this is why
I'm breaking up with you--

19:59.177 --> 20:01.144
you're a liar.

20:01.146 --> 20:03.629
See you in small claims court, bub.

20:06.466 --> 20:09.799
Well, we did it, Max.
We made $4,000.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.939
And as far as Andy and I go,

20:12.941 --> 20:14.290
I think we're in the right place,

20:14.292 --> 20:16.075
because when he said
he'd been thinking about me

20:16.077 --> 20:17.476
since the breakup,

20:17.478 --> 20:19.695
I realized I'd only been
thinking about the cupcakes.

20:19.697 --> 20:22.665
Oh, please, God, shut up.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.834
Thank you.
I was dying to shut up.

20:24.836 --> 20:27.954
Ooh.

20:27.956 --> 20:30.339
Look, it's a text from the place.

20:30.341 --> 20:32.959
They loved the cupcakes.

20:32.961 --> 20:34.961
Wait, why do I have my phone
in your apron?

20:34.963 --> 20:37.713
No, my phone was in my apron.

20:37.715 --> 20:40.016
Unless I handed you the wrong apron

20:40.018 --> 20:42.518
after I wiped them down.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.538
What? <i>What?</i>

20:45.540 --> 20:48.775
Oh... Your earring.

20:48.777 --> 20:50.693
I had it in there the whole time.

20:50.695 --> 20:52.645
Oh, we're idiots!

20:52.647 --> 20:55.980
We're two very different kinds
of idiots, but we're idiots.

20:56.534 --> 20:58.651
And yet, somehow we work.

20:58.653 --> 21:00.653
We're the most unlikely animal friends.

21:00.655 --> 21:03.156
I don't know about that,
but a picture of me nursing you

21:03.158 --> 21:05.491
would definitely go viral.

21:05.493 --> 21:08.444
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:08.446 --> 21:09.545
Where you going?

21:09.547 --> 21:10.797
I'm too tired to pull my bed down.

21:10.799 --> 21:12.715
- I'm sleeping with you.
- No, you're not.

21:12.717 --> 21:14.967
You have super gonorrhea.

21:17.717 --> 21:21.967
