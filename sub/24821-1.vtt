04:11.150 --> 04:12.149
You're too late, Cal.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.317
They already called you.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.109
Really?

04:14.111 --> 04:15.360
Shit.

04:15.362 --> 04:17.153
Hey hey, didn't
you hear what I said?

04:17.154 --> 04:18.071
Dude, get out of my
way maybe I can make it.

04:18.072 --> 04:19.947
This isn't some small indie,

04:19.950 --> 04:21.406
this is a Martin Scorsese film.

04:21.409 --> 04:24.203
I said get out of my way.

04:24.205 --> 04:25.578
Dude, what the fuck?

04:25.580 --> 04:28.707
This is a new shirt, asshole.

04:28.709 --> 04:30.127
I better see you at
tomorrow night's event.

04:33.130 --> 04:41.010
Asshole.

04:48.145 --> 04:49.477
I'm gonna call her.

04:49.479 --> 04:51.729
You got to date multiple
chicks at once, dude.

04:51.731 --> 04:53.607
It's the only way to do it.

04:53.609 --> 04:59.530
You don't get it, man.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.198
Did they call me?

05:01.200 --> 05:08.705
No.

05:08.707 --> 05:10.623
Scott is such a dick.

05:10.625 --> 05:14.460
What do you expect
from a guy like that?

05:14.462 --> 05:16.087
Cal, what's up, buddy?

05:16.089 --> 05:17.090
How's it going?

05:18.926 --> 05:19.842
Who's in there now?

05:19.844 --> 05:20.635
Bob.

05:23.431 --> 05:25.849
I thought he was in rehab.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.392
How did he manage this audition?

05:28.394 --> 05:30.184
Probably made
a few phone calls.

05:30.186 --> 05:31.686
What do you
think his chances are?

05:31.688 --> 05:33.022
He's a good actor,

05:33.024 --> 05:36.107
but the dude's got
a lot of baggage.

05:36.109 --> 05:37.443
I don't know,

05:37.445 --> 05:39.611
I think he might be
turning over a new leaf.

05:39.613 --> 05:40.946
His old lady whipped
him into shape

05:40.948 --> 05:42.323
after she got pregnant.

05:42.325 --> 05:43.948
What do you mean?

05:43.950 --> 05:46.118
I mean he's dressing
up in a clown suit

05:46.120 --> 05:49.246
and working part time at
little kids' birthday parties.

05:49.248 --> 05:49.996
What?

05:49.998 --> 05:51.414
That is some sick shit.

05:51.416 --> 05:53.374
Yeah, super fucked up.

05:53.376 --> 05:55.501
She says it's like
preparing him for fatherhood

05:55.503 --> 05:58.505
or some shit like
that, I don't know.

05:58.507 --> 06:01.174
Thanks Ellen, great to see
you, too.

06:01.176 --> 06:03.301
Hey, what do we got here?

06:03.303 --> 06:04.802
How'd it go in there?

06:04.804 --> 06:06.138
Oh you know how we do.

06:06.140 --> 06:09.265
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

06:09.267 --> 06:11.893
Wanna celebrate with
a little spliffy spliff?

06:11.895 --> 06:13.561
It's on the house.

06:13.563 --> 06:15.272
Nah, man, I'm done with that.

06:15.274 --> 06:16.398
Putting it all behind me.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.232
Clean and clear from now on.

06:18.234 --> 06:20.818
Hey bro, I totally
understand, you do you.

06:20.820 --> 06:22.278
Whatever makes you happy.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.239
Makes me happy.

06:24.241 --> 06:25.323
Good to see you buddy.

06:25.325 --> 06:26.532
- Be good.
- Later.

06:26.534 --> 06:27.743
I'll see you, too.

06:27.745 --> 06:29.413
You guys break a leg.

06:32.207 --> 06:32.999
Hey!

06:36.921 --> 06:39.507
He'll relapse, they always do.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.777
Incoming call.

07:02.779 --> 07:04.696
Sam, what's up?

07:04.698 --> 07:05.989
Not too much,

07:05.991 --> 07:07.366
just wanted to see
what you were up to.

07:07.368 --> 07:08.866
I'm heading over to Heather's.

07:08.868 --> 07:09.660
Hot Heather?

07:09.662 --> 07:11.244
Yeah that's the one.

07:11.246 --> 07:13.205
How are you
swinging that with Veronica?

07:13.207 --> 07:14.498
She went down to Palm Springs

07:14.500 --> 07:17.167
with her dad to see a
Tony Bennet concert.

07:17.169 --> 07:20.921
Gonna be spending daddy's
dime at the spa all week.

07:20.923 --> 07:23.297
You're still bitter
that he doesn't like you.

07:23.299 --> 07:25.174
No man, fuck that guy.

07:25.176 --> 07:27.260
He got his blood money
from fucking up the planet

07:27.262 --> 07:30.097
now he's using it to buy
back his daughter's love.

07:30.099 --> 07:32.140
Well hey, at least she
gets to live the high life.

07:32.142 --> 07:33.434
She's no better than him.

07:33.436 --> 07:36.395
She wants to be the
next it reality star.

07:36.397 --> 07:39.898
Okay, seriously do
not make a sex tape with her.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.859
Those never turn out
well for the dude.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.609
Trust me dude, if
I book this role,

07:43.611 --> 07:45.821
I'm dumping that cellulite ass.

07:45.823 --> 07:46.905
Speaking of which,

07:46.907 --> 07:48.239
how did that audition go?

07:48.241 --> 07:50.118
Honestly, I crushed it.

07:51.953 --> 07:53.578
Give them
the old in and out?

07:53.580 --> 07:55.164
No, thank god.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.205
But I was ready.

07:56.207 --> 07:57.958
Got to pay the bills.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.208
You should
just get a sugar daddy

07:59.210 --> 08:01.337
like everyone else in this town.

08:01.339 --> 08:04.297
That's what Veronica
was supposed to be.

08:04.299 --> 08:05.340
The trickle down
effect from her daddy

08:05.342 --> 08:08.010
ain't working out
so well for me.

08:08.012 --> 08:09.345
Well, sketchy or not,

08:09.347 --> 08:11.220
it must be nice to
be getting roles.

08:11.222 --> 08:12.765
I can't even book
background work.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.767
Dude, seriously,

08:14.769 --> 08:16.393
you need to start
thinking about doing

08:16.395 --> 08:18.354
whatever it takes
to get these roles.

08:18.356 --> 08:21.357
Especially like the
one I just read for.

08:21.359 --> 08:22.398
What about
burning bridges

08:22.400 --> 08:23.691
with these casting directors?

08:23.693 --> 08:25.568
Aren't you afraid of
being put on a dead list?

08:25.570 --> 08:28.280
Man, I have banged some cows.

08:28.282 --> 08:32.700
Alright, I mean, I've even
done a little ass play.

08:32.702 --> 08:35.662
It's been tough road for me but,

08:35.664 --> 08:37.998
it's not like they
want a British romance.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.542
I mean one hand feeds
the other, you know.

08:40.544 --> 08:44.003
It's the natural order
of things down here.

08:44.005 --> 08:45.672
Well I hope you get it.

08:45.674 --> 08:48.383
You know I'm rooting for ya.

08:48.385 --> 08:49.426
Sam.

08:49.428 --> 08:50.303
Yeah?

08:52.180 --> 08:56.392
It's called blacklisted
not dead listed.

08:56.394 --> 08:57.308
Either way,

08:57.310 --> 08:58.351
just try to stay off the list.

08:58.353 --> 08:59.646
Yeah, thanks.

09:03.275 --> 09:04.358
...city wide alert.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.110
Be on the lookout for
a late model grey SUV,

09:07.112 --> 09:08.821
suspect is an
African American male

09:08.823 --> 09:10.781
believed to be
armed and dangerous.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.992
Be extremely cautious
and report any sightings

09:12.994 --> 09:15.284
to the authorities immediately.

09:15.286 --> 09:18.287
Glad I'm not black.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.032
Hello?

09:53.034 --> 09:55.367
Hello, Veronica?

09:55.369 --> 09:56.326
Zander?

09:59.457 --> 10:01.080
It's Zander, can you hear me?

10:01.082 --> 10:01.915
It's
really loud here,

10:01.917 --> 10:03.499
I can barely hear you.

10:03.501 --> 10:05.418
You gotta help
me, I'm freaking out!

10:05.420 --> 10:06.336
What?

10:06.338 --> 10:08.213
I think I'm trippin' out.

10:08.215 --> 10:11.175
Is this one
of your stupid ass jokes?

10:11.177 --> 10:12.508
What?

10:12.510 --> 10:13.801
No!

10:13.803 --> 10:15.803
- You gotta help me!
- On the phone?

10:15.805 --> 10:18.306
I think I'm going insane.

10:18.308 --> 10:19.391
This isn't Zander.

10:19.393 --> 10:20.642
I know his voice.

10:20.644 --> 10:21.893
Tell him to grow a pair

10:21.895 --> 10:23.854
and stop having
his asshole friends

10:23.856 --> 10:25.147
- prank call me.
- No!

10:25.149 --> 10:27.398
It's not a joke,
you gotta help me!

10:27.400 --> 10:29.902
Dad, stop,
I'll be right there.

10:29.904 --> 10:31.570
What, no!

10:31.572 --> 10:32.403
Daddy you know
she's way to young for you.

10:32.405 --> 10:33.529
Don't hang up!

10:33.531 --> 10:34.822
You disgust me.

10:34.824 --> 10:37.368
No no no!

10:37.370 --> 10:38.245
Fuck, fuck!

10:40.289 --> 10:42.998
Shit.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.374
Fuck fuck!

10:44.376 --> 10:47.085
This can't be fucking happening.

10:47.087 --> 10:48.673
Shit, what the fuck!

10:58.598 --> 11:00.474
Fuck fuck!

11:00.476 --> 11:04.478
Shit.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.854
Get out of the car!

11:06.856 --> 11:08.231
Show us your hands.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.984
This can't be fucking real.

11:10.986 --> 11:13.696
Roll down the
windows and show us your hands!

11:13.698 --> 11:15.822
Put your hands where
we can see them!

11:15.824 --> 11:17.365
Now, mother fucker!

11:17.367 --> 11:20.244
I'm coming
out, I'm unarmed.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.494
Now motherfucker!

11:21.496 --> 11:24.580
Now!

11:24.582 --> 11:27.625
This can't be real.

11:27.627 --> 11:29.420
Get out of the car.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.878
Put your hands where
we can see them.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.505
Get out of the car!

11:32.507 --> 11:34.298
Put your hands
out of the vehicle now!

11:34.300 --> 11:37.219
You have
until the count of three!

11:37.221 --> 11:38.889
One, two,

11:41.058 --> 11:42.016
three!

11:46.605 --> 11:47.562
He's got a gun!

12:07.834 --> 12:10.502
Hey dude, where's Trevor?

12:10.504 --> 12:12.003
What?

12:12.005 --> 12:13.504
Your roommate.

12:13.506 --> 12:15.008
Your acting mentor.

12:17.385 --> 12:19.677
He's not my mentor.

12:19.679 --> 12:21.305
Really?

12:21.307 --> 12:22.099
Really.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.268
Okay.

12:27.313 --> 12:28.686
I always just
assumed you were like

12:28.688 --> 12:30.480
his pupil or something.

12:30.482 --> 12:32.733
I'm not.

12:32.735 --> 12:33.527
Sure.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.656
Well where is he?

12:38.658 --> 12:39.450
He's uh,

12:40.617 --> 12:42.242
his agent couldn't
book him the audition

12:42.244 --> 12:43.786
because he's already
cast in a series

12:43.788 --> 12:46.582
that's gonna be
filming in Hawaii.

12:48.417 --> 12:49.917
Cool.

12:49.919 --> 12:51.292
Cool.

12:51.294 --> 12:52.710
I just got off a pretty
bitchin' recurring role

12:52.712 --> 12:55.214
on Hawaii Five-0 myself.

12:55.216 --> 12:56.133
Super sick.

12:58.968 --> 13:00.009
Probably better
for the both of us

13:00.011 --> 13:01.595
if he's on that series, huh?

13:01.597 --> 13:02.638
Yeah.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.638
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.683
Tell him I
said what's up, though.

13:06.685 --> 13:07.477
Sure.

13:24.786 --> 13:25.578
Yeah.

13:30.668 --> 13:31.709
Hey hold on.

13:47.601 --> 13:48.977
Undead?

13:49.812 --> 13:51.478
No one's home.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.398
I fucking killed it tonight.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.902
Yeah, I met all the junior
agents from CAA and WME.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.738
Plus I had a long conversation

14:00.740 --> 14:03.534
with a top exec from
New Line Cinema.

14:04.827 --> 14:08.454
That's right, the
house that Fred built.

14:08.456 --> 14:16.085
Yeah, everyone was talking
about Scorsese's new movie.

14:16.087 --> 14:18.047
I mean look who's in it.

14:18.049 --> 14:19.130
It's guaranteed nominations

14:19.132 --> 14:21.718
across the mother fucking board.

14:22.928 --> 14:26.013
I'm gonna get that
role if it kills me.

14:26.015 --> 14:27.806
I'm up against all the regulars.

14:27.808 --> 14:30.350
But this time no Trevor.

14:30.352 --> 14:33.644
Thank god,
he's a fucking menace.

14:33.646 --> 14:35.564
Too bad his roommate Cal
wasn't there tonight.

14:35.566 --> 14:39.484
I was looking forward
to embarrassing him.

14:39.486 --> 14:44.657
You know how I like to make
people look like assholes.

14:44.659 --> 14:46.658
Yeah.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.286
Talk to you later.

15:24.781 --> 15:25.991
What the fuck?

16:28.888 --> 16:31.888
Scotty quit
being an asshole.

19:44.332 --> 19:45.916
Thanks for coming in, Cal.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.251
Thank you.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.168
And I really apologize
I had to keep looking

19:49.170 --> 19:50.378
down at the script.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.630
It's fine, it's an audition.

19:52.632 --> 19:54.882
Marlon Brando used cue
cards for the Godfather.

19:54.884 --> 19:57.927
I know, but I should
be more prepared.

19:57.929 --> 19:59.429
You know I'm actually
really good at

19:59.431 --> 20:01.305
memorizing lines it's just that,

20:01.307 --> 20:04.059
you know there was a
lot of slang and cursing

20:04.061 --> 20:05.519
and I wanted to make
sure I said every fuck

20:05.521 --> 20:06.936
the way it's written.

20:06.938 --> 20:08.772
You know, because I know
behind every single one

20:08.774 --> 20:11.608
there's a reason behind
it, because syntax

20:11.610 --> 20:15.654
and diction are really very
important to the characters.

20:15.656 --> 20:17.113
You know that's how we know

20:17.115 --> 20:18.157
who they really are.

20:18.159 --> 20:21.411
It's so vivid and you
can really taste it,

20:23.121 --> 20:27.291
it's like a fine meal.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.002
I think you mean a fine wine.

20:30.004 --> 20:31.919
What did I say?

20:31.921 --> 20:32.920
You said a fine meal.

20:32.922 --> 20:34.090
Oh did I?

20:36.092 --> 20:39.511
Speaking of which maybe
you wanna, I don't know,

20:39.513 --> 20:42.598
maybe you wanna
go grab one maybe,

20:42.600 --> 20:44.349
discuss the role maybe?

20:44.351 --> 20:46.351
That would be
very unprofessional.

20:46.353 --> 20:49.396
We'll get back to
you about the role.

20:49.398 --> 20:50.190
Okay.

21:00.450 --> 21:02.117
Fuck.

21:02.119 --> 21:04.080
Fuck fuck fuck.

21:18.134 --> 21:19.009
At the tone,

21:19.011 --> 21:21.052
please leave a message.

21:21.054 --> 21:22.763
Hey Trev, it's Cal.

21:22.765 --> 21:25.515
Just got out of the audition.

21:25.517 --> 21:26.976
Went pretty shitty.

21:28.562 --> 21:29.977
And I harassed the
casting director

21:29.979 --> 21:31.980
about how shitty it went.

21:31.982 --> 21:35.945
I gave this whole speech
about diction and grammar.

21:37.278 --> 21:38.654
Bitch puts her hand down and I

21:38.656 --> 21:41.534
give her a weak
handshake so, fuck.

21:43.034 --> 21:46.496
Alright I'll see you
back at the apartment.

22:16.276 --> 22:17.486
What the fuck?

22:28.163 --> 22:28.955
What?

23:10.497 --> 23:11.789
You had her, man!

23:11.791 --> 23:13.624
I am telling you
that you had her.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.208
Do you think she
would have given you

23:15.210 --> 23:17.628
her phone number if she wasn't
down to at least hook up?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.253
Maybe she wanted to be
friends, I don't know.

23:19.255 --> 23:20.296
Friends?

23:20.298 --> 23:21.215
Are you insane?

23:21.217 --> 23:22.925
For god's sake she was DTF.

23:22.927 --> 23:27.053
I mean, her friend's
in the backseat!

23:27.055 --> 23:27.846
Whatever.

23:27.848 --> 23:29.138
Whatever?

23:29.140 --> 23:30.515
Man I am trying to
be your friend here.

23:30.517 --> 23:32.892
And when your wing
man hands you a nine

23:32.894 --> 23:34.186
on a silver platter,

23:34.188 --> 23:37.063
fuck that, on a golden platter

23:37.065 --> 23:39.358
and you don't have the
balls to seal the deal?

23:39.360 --> 23:40.984
I'm not like you, alright man?

23:40.986 --> 23:43.821
I can't just walk up to
any girl and get her.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.155
Shut up.

23:45.157 --> 23:50.119
I'm just not a one
night stand kind of guy.

23:50.121 --> 23:51.788
Is this about Jane?

23:53.040 --> 23:57.167
Dude, I love you but
you gotta let her go.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.168
Like that ship has sailed

23:59.170 --> 24:03.258
and it is long, long, long gone.

24:10.015 --> 24:10.807
Come on.

24:12.142 --> 24:14.685
I still love her, man.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.855
I dream about her

24:17.857 --> 24:22.359
every night, I wake
up crying every day.

24:22.361 --> 24:25.281
Everything I see
reminds me of her.

24:26.990 --> 24:34.871
She didn't even text
me on my birthday.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.541
Five years, you know.

24:39.794 --> 24:41.378
I mean come on.

24:41.380 --> 24:44.340
Jesus.

24:44.342 --> 24:45.633
You hide it well.

24:47.553 --> 24:50.346
Maybe you are a good
actor after all.

24:50.348 --> 24:51.140
Thanks.

24:52.307 --> 24:53.223
Listen, man.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.849
You're gonna get over her.

24:54.851 --> 24:57.311
It's just gonna take some time.

24:57.313 --> 24:59.271
Yeah.

24:59.273 --> 25:04.443
Hey, hope you
learned your lesson.

25:04.445 --> 25:05.819
I'll tell you this much,

25:05.821 --> 25:08.032
I am never cheating again.

25:11.243 --> 25:15.039
Oh shit, look out!

25:17.874 --> 25:19.041
You alright?

25:19.043 --> 25:20.417
I'm fine, I'm fine.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.920
Is she alright?

25:26.425 --> 25:27.217
Goddammit.

25:31.429 --> 25:32.305
What is this?

25:36.393 --> 25:39.269
Hey, hey, I don't
mean to be impolite,

25:39.271 --> 25:42.398
but will you get off
the fucking road?

25:42.400 --> 25:45.359
Hey, get off the road,
get off the road!

25:45.361 --> 25:47.571
What's going on?

25:50.865 --> 25:52.325
Get off the road.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.744
Get off the fucking road.

26:03.670 --> 26:06.629
Thank you, dumb fucking bitch.

26:11.845 --> 26:15.138
Lock the door, lock the door!

26:15.140 --> 26:15.932
Fuck.

26:18.811 --> 26:19.726
What do we do?

26:19.728 --> 26:22.273
Get off the fucking car, lady.

26:26.235 --> 26:28.611
Dude she is freaking me out.

26:29.822 --> 26:33.365
What the fuck, hey
lady, we wanna leave.

26:33.367 --> 26:36.618
We're trying to leave,
can you get off the road?

26:36.620 --> 26:38.039
Do you know her?

26:39.372 --> 26:40.539
Know her?

26:40.541 --> 26:42.457
She keeps looking at you.

26:49.425 --> 26:51.344
Fuck it, she'll move.

26:52.887 --> 26:55.348
- Bitch, we're leaving.
- Get off!

26:58.309 --> 26:59.474
Shit!

26:59.476 --> 27:00.561
Oh goddammit.

27:03.688 --> 27:04.605
Shit.

27:04.607 --> 27:05.898
What are you doing?

27:05.900 --> 27:06.691
What?

27:12.573 --> 27:13.490
You okay?

27:15.743 --> 27:16.744
You alright?

27:24.752 --> 27:26.001
What?

27:26.003 --> 27:27.293
Dude I hate to
do this to you man,

27:27.295 --> 27:28.753
but you're gonna have
to get in the trunk.

27:28.755 --> 27:30.004
What?

27:30.006 --> 27:35.511
I owe you but, you
gotta get in the trunk.

27:35.513 --> 27:37.553
Fuck that, I am
not getting in there.

27:37.555 --> 27:45.978
Get in the goddamn
fucking trunk.

27:51.111 --> 27:52.485
Listen man, I'm sorry.

27:52.487 --> 27:53.904
I know this fucking sucks.

27:53.906 --> 27:57.323
But we'll be back
in time, alright?

27:57.325 --> 27:58.408
You owe me.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.955
Just get in the goddamn trunk.

28:07.210 --> 28:08.543
See ya in 10 bitch.

28:23.601 --> 28:24.394
Come on.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.066
Asshole.

28:50.795 --> 28:54.132
Hello, I'd like to
get out of here now!

28:56.009 --> 28:58.593
Karl open the trunk.

28:58.595 --> 29:02.097
Karl open the trunk!

29:02.099 --> 29:02.933
Karl?

29:06.019 --> 29:06.811
Oh shit.

29:08.022 --> 29:10.481
Oh shit, oh shit, shit.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.524
Got you mother fucker!

29:13.526 --> 29:15.821
Fuck you man, Jesus Christ,

29:16.656 --> 29:19.907
I thought it was that old bitch.

29:19.909 --> 29:21.494
Where is she anyway?

29:25.956 --> 29:28.122
You brought her to our house?

29:28.124 --> 29:29.707
What do you wanna do,

29:29.709 --> 29:32.503
leave the old bag in the
middle of the fucking road?

29:32.505 --> 29:34.921
I don't know man, maybe.

29:34.923 --> 29:37.509
I mean look at her, she's scary.

29:42.723 --> 29:45.264
Listen, we're just
gonna go in there,

29:45.266 --> 29:46.599
call the authorities,

29:46.601 --> 29:50.063
they'll come get her,
and then quick and easy.

29:52.650 --> 29:53.732
Alright, but I'm serious.

29:53.734 --> 29:54.524
You promise?

29:54.526 --> 29:55.693
Yes.

29:55.695 --> 29:57.196
Yes yes, I promise.

29:58.989 --> 30:00.115
Jesus Christ.

30:00.908 --> 30:01.700
Fine.

30:02.994 --> 30:04.328
Where'd she go?

30:06.831 --> 30:08.830
Quick and easy, huh?

30:08.832 --> 30:10.374
Shut up.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.542
Come on.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.711
I am not going in there.

30:13.713 --> 30:17.130
You know, I always thought
you were a fucking pussy

30:17.132 --> 30:18.173
and it really shows.

30:18.175 --> 30:19.716
Alright, alright fine.

30:19.718 --> 30:22.513
I'll go in there
but you go first.

30:36.276 --> 30:37.068
Hello?

30:38.987 --> 30:39.779
Old lady.

30:42.783 --> 30:44.118
Where'd you go?

31:07.475 --> 31:08.432
Did you see that?

31:08.434 --> 31:09.308
No.

31:09.310 --> 31:10.224
- What?
- That hand!

31:10.226 --> 31:11.060
You didn't see that hand?

31:11.062 --> 31:11.937
What, no.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.568
There's nothing in here.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.986
I swear to god
I saw something.

31:57.984 --> 32:00.234
That's it, I'm calling the cops.

32:05.865 --> 32:07.782
Hi, yeah there's an old
lady on my property,

32:07.784 --> 32:10.286
I think she might be psychotic.

32:12.747 --> 32:14.833
We're at 234 Holden Street.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.171
Uh huh, no, I don't think so.

32:23.175 --> 32:27.176
Okay, thank you.

32:27.178 --> 32:28.848
They're on their way.

32:34.269 --> 32:35.061
Karl?

32:40.234 --> 32:42.025
Wait here.

32:42.027 --> 32:42.819
What?

32:44.237 --> 32:45.698
What are you doing?

32:50.410 --> 32:51.202
What?

32:54.790 --> 33:05.174
What, what do you want?

33:54.934 --> 33:55.726
Shit.

33:59.604 --> 34:00.397
Whoa.

34:03.525 --> 34:06.443
Okay, let's take it easy, Karl.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.986
Just.

34:12.159 --> 34:13.074
Shit.

35:52.008 --> 35:54.135
What do you want from me?

35:56.555 --> 35:59.347
Leave me alone!

36:07.066 --> 36:07.898
- Jane!
- You've been

36:07.900 --> 36:09.108
- calling my parents?
- Jane.

36:09.110 --> 36:10.066
What do you think

36:10.068 --> 36:12.068
- you're doing?
- Jane, listen.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.489
I just, I want you know that

36:17.200 --> 36:17.994
I'm sorry,

36:20.746 --> 36:23.664
I'm sorry for everything.

36:23.666 --> 36:26.541
What you did
to me is unforgivable.

36:26.543 --> 36:29.128
I love you so much.

36:29.130 --> 36:31.088
More than anything in the world.

36:33.843 --> 36:38.137
I wish that I could go back
and do it all over again.

36:38.139 --> 36:39.178
I wish that I could.

36:39.180 --> 36:40.430
Let it go, Jason.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.349
We've been apart
for over a year now.

36:42.351 --> 36:44.269
I'll always love you.

36:46.229 --> 36:47.271
You're my only one.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.023
I told you it's over.

36:49.025 --> 36:50.899
Move on and don't call
me or my family again.

36:50.901 --> 36:53.861
Jane, Jane I'm sorry,
I love you, please!

36:53.863 --> 36:54.903
Goodbye.

37:52.253 --> 37:53.754
Hey hey hey.

37:53.756 --> 37:55.296
Hey.

37:55.298 --> 37:58.175
I got your message and
I'm sure you did fine.

37:58.177 --> 38:00.593
Did you listen to
the entire message?

38:00.595 --> 38:02.970
Basically harassed
that casting director.

38:02.972 --> 38:04.765
As long as it's not
sexual harassment,

38:04.767 --> 38:06.057
I'm sure you're okay.

38:06.059 --> 38:08.894
Well sexual harassment
is flirting gone bad,

38:08.896 --> 38:12.358
this was not flirtation
it was desperation.

38:14.110 --> 38:16.693
We're all desperate, man.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.028
You've been booking gigs solid

38:18.030 --> 38:19.738
for the last two years, okay?

38:19.740 --> 38:22.908
I design business websites for

38:22.910 --> 38:25.160
middle aged women just
to make ends meet.

38:25.162 --> 38:27.037
Hence the isolation.

38:27.039 --> 38:29.455
Spending eight hours a day
in front of a computer.

38:29.457 --> 38:31.166
How do you think I'm
booking these gigs?

38:31.168 --> 38:32.166
Talent?

38:32.168 --> 38:34.253
It's all about
who you know, man.

38:34.255 --> 38:35.671
You should really hang
out with Scott more

38:35.673 --> 38:37.588
and do those networking events.

38:37.590 --> 38:39.758
Why would I want to
hang out with Scott?

38:39.760 --> 38:41.260
Do you know what
he did to me today?

38:41.262 --> 38:43.262
You gotta break out
of your shell, man.

38:43.264 --> 38:44.470
I have.

38:44.472 --> 38:47.140
It's not me, it's,

38:47.142 --> 38:48.600
it's everybody else.

38:48.602 --> 38:52.187
It's like the Twilight
Zone or something.

38:52.189 --> 38:53.312
What's this?

38:53.314 --> 38:54.356
What's what?

38:54.358 --> 38:56.066
This book.

38:56.068 --> 38:57.108
Oh yeah.

38:57.110 --> 38:58.776
That landed on my
car on the way home

38:58.778 --> 39:00.155
from the audition.

39:01.365 --> 39:03.115
What do you mean it
landed on your car?

39:03.117 --> 39:06.410
I mean I was
driving home and then,

39:09.122 --> 39:09.914
Dammit!

39:12.959 --> 39:14.292
And then it just fell on my car.

39:14.294 --> 39:16.919
What like, fell off
the back of a truck?

39:16.921 --> 39:19.173
No, I mean like it
literally landed on my car

39:19.175 --> 39:20.966
like from the sky.

39:20.968 --> 39:22.300
It didn't cause any damage

39:22.302 --> 39:25.012
so I'm guessing it
was, I don't know,

39:25.014 --> 39:28.432
like a low flying
drone or something.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.767
Did it have a name
on it or anything?

39:30.769 --> 39:31.934
No.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.104
Why, is it rare?

39:36.316 --> 39:39.943
'Cause I would sell
this in a heart beat.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.736
I know you're into
all that mystic stuff

39:41.738 --> 39:43.030
so I actually wanted
you to look at it

39:43.032 --> 39:45.198
before I put it on Craigslist,

39:45.200 --> 39:46.658
you know so I don't get screwed.

39:46.660 --> 39:48.994
You wanna sell a book
that fell from the sky?

39:48.996 --> 39:50.204
From a drone.

39:50.206 --> 39:51.287
Don't be an idiot.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.789
What else could it be from?

39:52.791 --> 39:54.707
I mean if it fell from a plane,

39:54.709 --> 39:56.001
it would have damaged my car,

39:56.003 --> 39:58.169
so what difference does it make?

39:58.171 --> 39:59.296
Oh unless saying
it landed on my car

39:59.298 --> 40:01.506
helps me sell it
for more money then.

40:01.508 --> 40:02.635
You can say whatever you want.

40:04.845 --> 40:06.928
You cannot sell this book.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.680
Yes I can.

40:08.682 --> 40:12.184
No, you can't.

40:12.186 --> 40:14.563
This book is destined for you.

40:18.233 --> 40:19.025
Okay.

40:22.738 --> 40:25.116
This book is your salvation.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.856
Hey.

40:58.858 --> 41:00.231
You are not going out,

41:00.233 --> 41:02.151
do you know what can wash
up after a huge storm?

41:02.153 --> 41:03.068
Is that a fact?

41:03.070 --> 41:04.945
The water looks pretty grody.

41:04.947 --> 41:07.448
Yeah well, I'm not really
a big follow the rules

41:07.450 --> 41:09.408
kind of guy, so.

41:09.410 --> 41:10.492
Speaking of, what are you two

41:10.494 --> 41:12.369
law abiding citizens doing here?

41:12.371 --> 41:14.079
What do you think?

41:14.081 --> 41:15.204
The usual?

41:15.206 --> 41:17.832
Except we want a discount.

41:17.834 --> 41:20.419
I'm not Walmart, I'm
a small business man.

41:20.421 --> 41:21.336
No discounts.

41:21.338 --> 41:23.338
The last batch was subpar.

41:23.340 --> 41:24.881
I'm sorry, ladies.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.133
But the Mexicans are
going bat shit loco

41:27.135 --> 41:29.303
over this new medical
grade stuff so,

41:29.305 --> 41:31.637
must have been a slip
up on the supply side.

41:31.639 --> 41:33.932
That's not our problem.

41:33.934 --> 41:35.309
Courtney, you know me.

41:35.311 --> 41:37.269
I wouldn't try to
screw you over.

41:37.271 --> 41:38.812
Subpar.

41:38.814 --> 41:40.648
Okay, no one bats a thousand.

41:40.650 --> 41:43.524
Let's just like call it
mulligan and start over.

41:43.526 --> 41:46.528
You're mixing up
your sports, Kush.

41:46.530 --> 41:48.363
Alice, will you tell
your friend Courtney here...

41:48.365 --> 41:51.034
Customer is
always right, Kush.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.285
You two are a real pair, man.

41:54.287 --> 41:56.704
Okay, fine fine fine.

41:56.706 --> 41:57.999
Just this once.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.459
Thank you.

42:01.461 --> 42:02.878
And thank you.

42:02.880 --> 42:03.796
- Bye.
- Ta ta.

42:03.798 --> 42:04.799
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:22.894 --> 44:23.771
Fuck, fuck!

44:26.023 --> 44:35.613
Hey Kush,
come smoke with us!

44:40.579 --> 44:41.954
What the fuck?

44:41.956 --> 45:04.225
What the fuck, what the fuck!

48:27.972 --> 48:30.349
I cannot believe you
convinced me to do this.

48:30.351 --> 48:31.725
You're the one who
said he would do anything

48:31.727 --> 48:33.227
to be in the next Scorsese film.

48:33.229 --> 48:35.269
Trevor, I was being sarcastic.

48:35.271 --> 48:36.689
Alright, I fucked up.

48:36.691 --> 48:37.814
That's all there is to it.

48:37.816 --> 48:39.108
This is how you unfuck it.

48:39.110 --> 48:40.776
I don't know.

48:40.778 --> 48:43.236
Praying to some satanic cult,

48:43.238 --> 48:46.365
I mean that's just
bad voodoo, man.

48:46.367 --> 48:49.617
It's not satanic,
it's not a cult.

48:49.619 --> 48:51.662
It's not voodoo.

48:51.664 --> 48:54.999
I think the word you're
looking for is juju.

48:55.001 --> 48:57.251
You'd be surprised at
the power of prayer.

48:57.253 --> 49:00.461
I know, you keep emailing
me articles about it.

49:00.463 --> 49:02.090
Just keep lighting.

49:17.314 --> 49:19.692
Alright, give me the envelope.

49:23.278 --> 49:26.571
Okay, let's see who's first?

49:26.573 --> 49:28.740
Zander.

49:28.742 --> 49:31.953
Sorry, Zander, it's
dog eat dog world.

49:33.747 --> 49:36.791
Alright, Cal can you
grab me the knife?

49:43.883 --> 49:49.218
Put it by the bowl.

49:49.220 --> 49:52.515
Maybe I should just
join Scientology.

49:55.311 --> 49:56.934
Hail to the almighty,

49:56.936 --> 50:00.439
for you give to us
the power to overcome.

50:00.441 --> 50:01.731
Hail to the almighty,

50:01.733 --> 50:05.362
for you give us the
strength to persevere.

50:06.613 --> 50:07.780
Hail to the almighty,

50:07.782 --> 50:10.032
for you give to us
the courage to take

50:10.034 --> 50:12.910
what others do not deserve.

50:12.912 --> 50:14.952
Hail to the almighty.

50:14.954 --> 50:16.790
We give to you our blood,

50:17.874 --> 50:31.095
our lives and our souls.

50:39.979 --> 50:42.939
Do it.

50:42.941 --> 50:43.733
Now.

50:46.861 --> 50:51.280
Keep going.

50:51.282 --> 50:52.159
Ah, fuck!

50:53.785 --> 50:54.577
Ah fuck.

53:06.836 --> 53:09.753
Bob, as usual
make yourself home,

53:09.755 --> 53:13.465
but please, this time leave
my cigars alone, Jeff.

53:13.467 --> 53:14.677
Sorry, Jeff.

55:08.039 --> 55:10.624
Well look who it is, Mr. Joker.

55:10.626 --> 55:12.126
Fancy running into you.

55:12.128 --> 55:14.336
That's a really nice
clown suit you got.

55:14.338 --> 55:15.339
Wanna share?

55:21.595 --> 55:26.308
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:28.519 --> 55:34.064
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:34.066 --> 55:37.526
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:37.528 --> 55:40.238
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:42.198 --> 55:44.867
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:44.869 --> 55:47.077
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:47.079 --> 55:49.329
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:49.331 --> 55:52.042
You can be anything
you wanna be.

55:57.173 --> 55:59.298
You can be anything
you wanna be.

56:05.389 --> 56:07.180
Hello?

56:07.182 --> 56:07.974
Hello?

56:21.530 --> 56:24.533
Dammit Kush, where
the fuck are you?

57:01.320 --> 57:02.111
Sammy!

57:02.113 --> 57:02.945
Hey Bob.

57:02.947 --> 57:04.570
Hey buddy how are ya?

57:04.572 --> 57:06.240
I'm doing great.

57:06.242 --> 57:07.825
Oh good, good.

57:07.827 --> 57:09.412
Look, I'm wondering.

57:10.912 --> 57:13.414
I'm wondering if I could
get a little bit more snow.

57:13.416 --> 57:14.957
I'm running out of snow here

57:14.959 --> 57:17.334
and I wanna go skiing
if you know what I mean.

57:17.336 --> 57:19.753
Sorry Bob, no
snow on the mountain tonight.

57:19.755 --> 57:20.671
What do you mean there's no

57:20.673 --> 57:21.879
fucking snow on the mountain?

57:21.881 --> 57:23.256
Sorry there's no snow.

57:23.258 --> 57:27.218
I'm out of snow, I wanna
go skiing, I need more snow.

57:27.220 --> 57:29.345
Listen, I can
get some for you tomorrow.

57:29.347 --> 57:30.847
Tomorrow's no good, man.

57:30.849 --> 57:34.309
I've got that clown gig,
I'm doing a kid's party.

57:34.311 --> 57:35.309
The sun's out, Bob,

57:35.311 --> 57:36.311
I don't know what else to say.

57:36.313 --> 57:38.354
- There's no snow.
- Well fuck you!

57:38.356 --> 57:40.524
I need it tonight.

57:40.526 --> 57:42.818
It's
the best I can do.

57:42.820 --> 57:45.486
I got an idea, how about
you just fucking figure it out

57:45.488 --> 57:50.533
and bring it here tonight, huh?

57:50.535 --> 57:51.660
Yeah, fine.

57:51.662 --> 57:52.785
Ah, that's what I thought.

57:52.787 --> 57:54.329
Good, how about one?

57:54.331 --> 57:58.709
How about one a.m., yeah
can you do one a.m. or 1:30?

57:58.711 --> 58:01.294
Yeah, 1:30 works.

58:01.296 --> 58:02.629
That's great.

58:02.631 --> 58:06.883
You know, that's work perfect
for me, actually it does.

58:06.885 --> 58:07.800
What!

58:07.802 --> 58:08.968
I didn't say anything.

58:08.970 --> 58:10.097
No not you.

58:10.972 --> 58:12.015
Hello?

58:12.974 --> 58:15.517
Look, I'll see you
at one, I gotta go.

58:21.525 --> 58:23.735
Over here.

58:24.903 --> 58:26.236
Hello?

58:29.784 --> 58:30.785
This way.

58:56.102 --> 58:59.352
What the fuck?

59:01.273 --> 59:02.233
What the fuck?

59:13.619 --> 59:14.412
Hello?

59:53.159 --> 59:55.035
The perfect clown suit.

01:00:33.573 --> 01:00:34.782
What the fuck?

01:00:34.784 --> 01:00:36.950
Mystery murder plague
the Hollywood area

01:00:36.952 --> 01:00:38.785
as the lives of
four young actors

01:00:38.787 --> 01:00:42.330
were taken over the
course of this past week.

01:00:42.332 --> 01:00:44.166
No motives are currently known,

01:00:44.168 --> 01:00:46.542
but there is one common thread,

01:00:46.544 --> 01:00:48.796
the bodies of each victim
were found with a symbol

01:00:48.798 --> 01:00:50.963
branded onto them.

01:00:50.965 --> 01:00:52.883
What the fuck?

01:01:05.731 --> 01:01:07.146
The same
symbol that was found

01:01:07.148 --> 01:01:09.149
branded on the body
of a young woman

01:01:09.151 --> 01:01:11.401
who was found mutilated
at a neighborhood park

01:01:11.403 --> 01:01:12.820
just two weeks ago.

01:01:15.907 --> 01:01:19.996
Scott Sherwood, Jason
Berrington and Kush Jenner.

01:01:21.454 --> 01:01:23.122
If you have any information

01:01:23.124 --> 01:01:24.539
on any of these victims,

01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:26.709
please call the number below.

01:01:26.711 --> 01:01:29.086
This is Sarah
Johnson signing off.

01:01:39.305 --> 01:01:40.474
What the fuck?

01:01:50.401 --> 01:01:52.526
At the
tone, leave a message.

01:01:52.528 --> 01:01:54.068
Cal,

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:57.157
dude answer your
fucking phone, dude.

01:02:09.878 --> 01:02:10.670
Hey.

01:02:11.963 --> 01:02:14.840
This isn't funny.

01:02:14.842 --> 01:02:15.633
Ha ha.

01:02:16.468 --> 01:02:17.470
Joke's over.

01:02:24.684 --> 01:02:29.646
Who took my fucking clown suit!

01:04:07.537 --> 01:04:08.331
Come on.

01:04:09.706 --> 01:04:10.497
Come on!

01:05:20.695 --> 01:05:31.077
Mickey!

01:05:31.079 --> 01:05:34.372
This is
just what I needed.

01:05:34.374 --> 01:05:35.166
Yeah.

01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:38.003
It's been a long week.

01:05:41.881 --> 01:05:43.673
90s horror films.

01:05:43.675 --> 01:05:46.050
It's all the same formula but

01:05:46.052 --> 01:05:48.595
they get me every time.

01:05:48.597 --> 01:05:50.180
It's hard to
emulate the classics.

01:05:50.182 --> 01:05:50.975
Yeah.

01:05:55.771 --> 01:05:58.856
This is what it's all about.

01:05:58.858 --> 01:06:00.818
Just relaxing, you know?

01:06:04.738 --> 01:06:06.696
If you can't enjoy
the little things,

01:06:06.698 --> 01:06:10.283
you'll never enjoy
the big ones, right?

01:06:10.285 --> 01:06:13.829
You sound all
enlightened and shit.

01:06:13.831 --> 01:06:15.789
Weed does that to me.

01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:17.332
Good weed.

01:06:17.334 --> 01:06:18.709
Kush?

01:06:18.711 --> 01:06:19.876
No.

01:06:19.878 --> 01:06:22.296
Couldn't get ahold of him.

01:06:22.298 --> 01:06:25.508
I got it from a guy
in Marina Del Ray.

01:06:27.635 --> 01:06:30.014
He's not an actor, he's legit.

01:06:31.557 --> 01:06:35.934
He sells everything
out of his house.

01:06:35.936 --> 01:06:37.061
Hey,

01:06:37.063 --> 01:06:38.771
do you have any more?

01:06:38.773 --> 01:06:39.854
Yeah.

01:06:39.856 --> 01:06:41.731
We should smoke it all
before I go to Hawaii.

01:06:41.733 --> 01:06:48.655
Yeah.

01:06:48.657 --> 01:06:50.948
I got a great story
for you when I get back.

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:51.744
Cool.

01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:03.336
Hey your phone.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:14.890
Your phone.

01:07:22.816 --> 01:07:25.024
So this girl at the table read

01:07:25.026 --> 01:07:27.026
for the show in Hawaii,

01:07:27.028 --> 01:07:30.323
afterwards she goes
up to the director,

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:36.787
she says, "I'm really excited
about going to Hawaii,

01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:39.789
"but I need to get my
passport renewed."

01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:41.791
I couldn't fucking believe it.

01:07:41.793 --> 01:07:44.919
Like, she knew
Hawaii was a state,

01:07:44.921 --> 01:07:48.006
but thought that because
it was so far away

01:07:48.008 --> 01:07:51.387
she still had to get
her passport renewed.

01:07:52.387 --> 01:07:54.972
These girls man, they're so hot,

01:07:54.974 --> 01:07:58.057
I think their brains
get overheated.

01:08:03.023 --> 01:08:04.731
You wanna order something?

01:08:04.733 --> 01:08:05.524
My treat.

01:08:20.374 --> 01:08:21.751
Fucking asshole!

01:08:22.876 --> 01:08:24.207
I should kill you!

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:25.627
Maybe once you're dead, I
can finally get a role!

01:08:25.629 --> 01:08:27.252
God, you're so selfish, Trevor!

01:08:27.255 --> 01:08:29.671
All you do is take and take

01:08:29.674 --> 01:08:32.216
and take and you don't
care about anyone else!

01:08:32.219 --> 01:08:33.010
God.

01:08:33.011 --> 01:08:34.720
Oh fuck.

01:08:34.721 --> 01:08:35.511
Fuck.

01:08:35.513 --> 01:08:37.513
Jesus fuck man.

01:08:37.515 --> 01:08:38.680
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:08:38.683 --> 01:08:40.350
You got a text
from your agent.

01:08:40.353 --> 01:08:41.435
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:08:41.437 --> 01:08:43.020
It's from Josh,

01:08:43.022 --> 01:08:45.564
it says check your email
about the Scorsese contract.

01:08:45.566 --> 01:08:48.899
Huh, the Scorsese contract,
not the television contract.

01:08:48.902 --> 01:08:52.444
For the film you said you
couldn't audition for!

01:08:52.447 --> 01:08:55.490
What do you want
me to fucking say?

01:08:55.492 --> 01:08:56.867
That you betrayed me!

01:08:56.868 --> 01:08:59.703
God, all you do is
take jobs from me!

01:08:59.705 --> 01:09:02.330
Commercials, TV
spots, movie parts.

01:09:02.332 --> 01:09:04.624
I don't take anything
from you.

01:09:04.626 --> 01:09:05.917
No one owns those parts,

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.586
I worked my ass off for that.

01:09:07.587 --> 01:09:08.837
I'm your friend!

01:09:08.839 --> 01:09:10.212
You should be helping me!

01:09:10.215 --> 01:09:13.131
You should be kicking jobs
my way once in a while, huh?

01:09:13.134 --> 01:09:14.926
Hollywood is a buffet line

01:09:14.929 --> 01:09:18.011
and everybody's
gunning for crab legs.

01:09:18.014 --> 01:09:19.930
You get there first
you eat the most.

01:09:19.933 --> 01:09:21.934
What are you talking about?

01:09:21.935 --> 01:09:23.935
It's a dog eat dog world.

01:09:23.937 --> 01:09:25.354
You know that, man.

01:09:25.356 --> 01:09:26.395
Oh my god I thought
you were locked in

01:09:26.398 --> 01:09:27.939
with that series, man!

01:09:27.942 --> 01:09:30.943
I thought you were locked
in with the series.

01:09:30.944 --> 01:09:33.444
I met Marty's producer
at a networking event.

01:09:33.446 --> 01:09:35.738
You know the ones I'm
always telling you go to?

01:09:35.741 --> 01:09:37.115
And they moved
things around for me.

01:09:37.117 --> 01:09:38.825
They were impressed with me.

01:09:38.827 --> 01:09:41.496
I guess it was my
firm handshake.

01:09:42.872 --> 01:09:44.122
You're an asshole.

01:09:44.125 --> 01:09:46.291
I guess being an
asshole works, doesn't it?

01:09:46.292 --> 01:09:47.877
So why did you hide
all this from me, huh?

01:09:51.131 --> 01:09:54.006
I didn't wanna break
your confidence, man.

01:09:54.009 --> 01:09:55.551
That's so nice.

01:09:55.553 --> 01:09:58.220
But I'm shattered
now, so thanks!

01:09:58.222 --> 01:10:02.181
I don't think I should
be punished for my success.

01:10:02.183 --> 01:10:06.436
This is not my problem,
this is your problem.

01:10:06.438 --> 01:10:07.231
Wow.

01:10:13.278 --> 01:10:15.779
What the?

01:10:15.781 --> 01:10:20.117
Jesus, Cal, why don't you
answer your fucking phone?

01:10:20.119 --> 01:10:28.624
You're not going to
believe my fucking night.

01:10:28.626 --> 01:10:30.209
Some clown tried
to fucking kill me.

01:10:30.211 --> 01:10:33.214
Dude, have you
looked at yourself?

01:10:34.674 --> 01:10:36.007
Oh yeah.

01:10:36.009 --> 01:10:40.222
No no no no, a real fucking
clown tried to kill me.

01:10:41.598 --> 01:10:43.181
I think he killed
all the others.

01:10:43.183 --> 01:10:46.267
Whoa whoa whoa, slow
down, what others?

01:10:46.269 --> 01:10:48.186
I don't know, man.

01:10:48.188 --> 01:10:51.065
Maybe he's part of a fucking
clown gang or something.

01:10:51.067 --> 01:10:53.191
I've never dealt with
a real clown before.

01:10:53.193 --> 01:10:54.901
Oh my god.

01:10:54.903 --> 01:10:56.694
I bet it's a fucking SAG thing.

01:10:56.696 --> 01:10:58.029
I didn't pay my
fucking SAG dues,

01:10:58.031 --> 01:10:59.864
did you pay your
fucking SAG dues?

01:10:59.866 --> 01:11:01.617
Are you high right now, man?

01:11:01.619 --> 01:11:03.118
I mean have you done any drugs,

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.872
PCP, cocaine maybe?

01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:07.080
Did you look at the news?

01:11:07.082 --> 01:11:07.955
It's all over the news.

01:11:07.957 --> 01:11:08.748
No.

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.083
PCP.

01:11:10.085 --> 01:11:11.752
Dude, everyone from
the audition is dead.

01:11:11.754 --> 01:11:13.044
What?

01:11:13.046 --> 01:11:13.962
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:11:13.964 --> 01:11:15.047
Dude, I swear to god, man.

01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:17.468
Zander, Scotty, Jason, Kush,

01:11:19.094 --> 01:11:20.386
they're all fucking toast.

01:11:20.388 --> 01:11:22.136
Holy shit.

01:11:22.138 --> 01:11:24.391
Trev, he's telling the truth.

01:11:26.518 --> 01:11:27.767
- What?
- Dude, dude,

01:11:27.769 --> 01:11:31.105
and the worst part,
the worst fucking part,

01:11:31.107 --> 01:11:32.230
look at this.

01:11:32.232 --> 01:11:34.190
What?

01:11:34.192 --> 01:11:35.484
What the fuck is that?

01:11:35.486 --> 01:11:38.613
They all have the
same mark on them.

01:11:40.616 --> 01:11:42.783
Oh my god.

01:11:42.785 --> 01:11:43.577
Oh fuck.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.163
This is what I'm fucking
telling you about, man.

01:11:48.165 --> 01:11:50.123
I'm fucking serious.

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:55.044
Jesus.

01:11:55.046 --> 01:11:57.381
It must have fucking
followed me here.

01:11:57.383 --> 01:11:58.966
I don't fucking know what to do.

01:11:58.968 --> 01:12:00.342
Dude, did you know
this was going to happen?

01:12:00.344 --> 01:12:02.386
I didn't know, I was going
on the power of belief.

01:12:02.388 --> 01:12:03.511
What about the ritual?

01:12:03.513 --> 01:12:04.721
What about the book?

01:12:04.723 --> 01:12:05.471
The book!

01:12:05.473 --> 01:12:06.806
The book.

01:12:06.808 --> 01:12:08.100
The book?

01:12:08.102 --> 01:12:09.184
Guys, maybe we should
call the fuckin'...

01:12:09.186 --> 01:12:10.226
You need to shut the fuck up

01:12:10.228 --> 01:12:11.602
and let us deal with this.

01:12:11.604 --> 01:12:13.564
No dude, how about
you shut the fuck up,

01:12:13.566 --> 01:12:15.065
let's call the fucking police.

01:12:15.067 --> 01:12:16.150
We killed our friends, man,

01:12:16.152 --> 01:12:17.484
we killed our friends.

01:12:17.486 --> 01:12:19.235
Maybe I can figure out
how to reverse the spell

01:12:19.237 --> 01:12:20.611
and bring them back, man.

01:12:20.613 --> 01:12:22.323
What are you
fucking talking about?

01:12:22.325 --> 01:12:23.657
Spell?

01:12:23.659 --> 01:12:24.699
No no no, no no no

01:12:24.701 --> 01:12:25.950
- no no no.
- What?

01:12:25.952 --> 01:12:26.952
- What?
- This can't be happening.

01:12:26.954 --> 01:12:27.869
- This can't be happening.
- What?

01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:29.664
What, Trev, what what?

01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:31.582
Dude.

01:12:31.584 --> 01:12:32.498
What does that mean?

01:12:34.045 --> 01:12:35.004
What the hell?

01:12:36.171 --> 01:12:37.962
Holy shit, what's going on, man?

01:12:37.964 --> 01:12:40.342
Dude, what's happening to him?

01:12:41.719 --> 01:12:44.722
What the?

01:12:52.854 --> 01:12:54.022
Holy shit, dude.

01:12:56.107 --> 01:12:57.067
What the fuck?

01:13:00.696 --> 01:13:01.405
I can't.

01:13:04.866 --> 01:13:07.117
His body is all fucking broken.

01:13:07.119 --> 01:13:09.246
He's fucking broken, man!

01:13:12.832 --> 01:13:14.917
How the
fuck did that happen?

01:13:14.919 --> 01:13:15.708
What?

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:16.503
What?

01:13:20.131 --> 01:13:20.924
What?

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.217
What the fuck is this?

01:13:32.268 --> 01:13:34.144
Dude, what the fuck is that?

01:13:34.146 --> 01:13:35.606
It's here for me.

01:13:49.954 --> 01:13:50.868
What the fuck, man.

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:52.162
How could you do this to me?

01:13:52.164 --> 01:13:59.252
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that was gonna happen, I swear.

01:13:59.254 --> 01:14:01.713
Okay, if this doesn't
work, I'm sorry too.

01:14:06.554 --> 01:14:09.473
What do you have
to be sorry for?

01:14:13.728 --> 01:14:14.812
Talk later!

01:14:53.267 --> 01:14:54.059
Trevor.

01:15:10.492 --> 01:15:11.283
No no no no.

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:53.574
What the fuck?

01:15:53.576 --> 01:15:54.369
Come on!

01:15:56.455 --> 01:15:57.247
Burn!

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:13.928
Okay.

01:17:28.964 --> 01:17:30.963
And that's a cut!

01:17:38.515 --> 01:17:39.556
Sorry.

01:17:39.558 --> 01:17:40.474
No no, it's fine.

01:17:40.476 --> 01:17:42.517
Experience of a lifetime, right?

01:17:42.519 --> 01:17:44.229
Anything Marty wants.

01:17:48.942 --> 01:17:50.068
Looks good.

01:17:53.363 --> 01:17:54.156
There.

01:17:56.157 --> 01:17:57.115
What is that?

01:18:01.121 --> 01:18:02.539
I'll be right back.

01:18:34.405 --> 01:18:36.613
Got you mother
fucker.
