00:21.633 --> 00:24.906
Calculator, check. Business
casual barrette, check.

00:24.931 --> 00:27.085
Um, has anyone seen my laser pointer?

00:27.094 --> 00:29.445
I borrowed it. Gene, look.

00:29.477 --> 00:30.987
Stop it, Louise. Your
brother's not a cat.

00:31.011 --> 00:32.277
I got it, I got it! Oh.

00:32.781 --> 00:34.584
- That's my boy.
- That was fun. I'm done.

00:34.609 --> 00:36.309
Tina, what's with all
the business stuff?

00:36.377 --> 00:38.017
Today's the first day
of Tweentrepreneurs,

00:38.079 --> 00:39.479
the Wagstaff small business class.

00:39.547 --> 00:40.613
We all signed up.

00:40.682 --> 00:43.149
Oh, yeah, my little business babies.

00:43.218 --> 00:44.550
Kids form an actual start-up

00:44.619 --> 00:46.552
to design, make and
sell our own new product.

00:46.621 --> 00:49.388
We're like Elon Musk...
Tina being the muskiest.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.601
Well, I think it's great to learn

00:50.625 --> 00:51.702
about being an entrepreneur.

00:51.726 --> 00:52.792
I mean, when I think back

00:52.817 --> 00:53.994
on when we started the restaurant,

00:54.019 --> 00:55.205
we didn't have two nickels.

00:55.230 --> 00:56.896
The second one rolled under the fridge.

00:56.965 --> 00:58.931
- You were so mad.
- But what we did have

00:58.967 --> 01:01.634
was a promise we made to our customers

01:01.703 --> 01:03.636
- and ourselves...
- Oh, boy, here we go.

01:03.705 --> 01:06.139
... that we'd never
compromise on quality.

01:06.207 --> 01:08.841
Never, never, never, never ever.

01:08.910 --> 01:10.009
So sometimes, then?

01:10.078 --> 01:11.677
No, Gene, never ever.

01:11.746 --> 01:14.514
Hey, uh, do you guys want
me to speak to your class?

01:14.582 --> 01:15.681
- About what?
- Oh, Dad.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.084
Um, I will definitely
put that out there.

01:18.153 --> 01:19.786
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

01:19.854 --> 01:22.188
Because it kind of sounds
like you're not going to.

01:22.223 --> 01:24.390
- No, it doesn't.
- Forget it.

01:24.425 --> 01:25.831
Whew. Oh, thank God.

01:27.362 --> 01:29.328
Entrepreneurship is no walk in the park.

01:29.397 --> 01:31.364
One day you have a
thriving Etsy business

01:31.399 --> 01:33.399
selling hand-knitted
Doctor Who scarves,

01:33.468 --> 01:36.002
the next, a PBS lawyer sends
you a cease and desist letter

01:36.070 --> 01:38.070
that practically threatens
to break your fingers.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.706
PBS will get you, boy. Don't
poke that hornet's nest.

01:40.775 --> 01:43.276
Now you will all present ideas
and choose one for production.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.444
And don't say Melrose Place mats.

01:45.513 --> 01:47.213
That's another long story.

01:47.282 --> 01:49.393
So, then the metal
tapers down from the handle

01:49.417 --> 01:50.950
to this end here.

01:51.019 --> 01:52.351
I call it the Pointy Pal.

01:52.387 --> 01:54.554
- That's a knife, Louise.
- Yeah.

01:54.622 --> 01:55.788
This roasted nut recipe

01:55.857 --> 01:57.257
is my own blend of herbs and spices.

01:57.292 --> 01:59.125
It's called Zeke's Hot Nut Sack.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.359
What?

02:00.428 --> 02:01.694
You need your asthma medicine,

02:01.763 --> 02:03.163
but you don't want to attract looks.

02:03.198 --> 02:05.264
Solution? Inhaler Hider.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.568
No one will know.

02:08.636 --> 02:10.136
It's a clown nose for horses.

02:10.205 --> 02:11.904
Why should they miss out on all the fun?

02:11.973 --> 02:13.973
One day Zeke wasn't
around, and I was bored.

02:14.042 --> 02:15.508
- Lonely?
- No, more bored.

02:15.577 --> 02:16.709
- Sad?
- No.

02:16.778 --> 02:18.110
Anyway, I saw a chunk of wood,

02:18.179 --> 02:20.081
and I thought, "Hey,
that's almost as good."

02:20.106 --> 02:22.114
So I made Wood Chuck.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.383
That wood has eyes. I love it.

02:24.452 --> 02:26.819
Is it weird that I kind
of want it to like me?

02:26.888 --> 02:29.822
Wooden yet cuddly. Step
aside, Josh Hartnett.

02:29.891 --> 02:31.457
Looks like Wood Chucks it is.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.659
Great. Now, as you set
up your company, remember,

02:33.728 --> 02:35.461
you kids are in charge, not me.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.096
- So like always?
- Hmm.

02:37.131 --> 02:38.431
Jimmy Jr. should be president

02:38.499 --> 02:40.486
because he did invent Wood Chuck.

02:40.511 --> 02:42.111
I should be vice president of sales

02:42.136 --> 02:43.781
because people literally
cannot say no to me.

02:43.805 --> 02:46.606
- Let me try. N...
- Mm-mm.

02:46.674 --> 02:48.641
- Don't do it.
- I can't do it.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.076
Hey, I'll be the executive

02:50.144 --> 02:51.777
in charge of sitting
on corners of desks,

02:51.846 --> 02:53.613
keeping the mood light.
Who needs a nickname?

02:53.681 --> 02:55.615
- How about you, Side Pony?
- Hmm.

02:55.683 --> 02:57.116
Doesn't somebody have to make them?

02:57.185 --> 02:59.505
Oh, yeah, you got to saw
the wood, sand it, stain it,

02:59.530 --> 03:01.764
stick on the googly eyes just right...

03:01.789 --> 03:03.923
Ew. So you and you and
you and you can do that.

03:03.992 --> 03:05.202
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.093
Job well done. I mean, my job.

03:07.161 --> 03:08.728
You guys are just getting started.

03:09.831 --> 03:10.997
Hey, there's a plate

03:11.065 --> 03:12.865
we don't need to wash. Ha!

03:12.901 --> 03:15.468
I mean, we will. We
always do. Eventually.

03:15.536 --> 03:18.070
- Everything was so good.
- Aw, thank you.

03:18.139 --> 03:19.705
Here you go. No rush.

03:19.774 --> 03:22.008
Uh, excuse me, did you say "no rush"?

03:22.076 --> 03:23.356
Yeah, whenever you're ready, hon.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.645
- Well, then, I guess that would be...
- Yeah?

03:25.713 --> 03:27.346
Never!

03:27.415 --> 03:29.382
- A dine-and-dasher! Bob!
- Oh, my God!

03:29.450 --> 03:32.318
- How big a check?
- $7.50 plus tip. He liked me.

03:32.387 --> 03:33.664
- There would have been a tip.
- That's...

03:33.688 --> 03:35.154
Never mind. I'm gonna get him.

03:35.223 --> 03:36.500
- Go!
- Bob's chasing him.

03:36.524 --> 03:38.582
Go, Bob, g... Oh, Bob gave up.

03:38.808 --> 03:40.059
Now he's walking back.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.727
Now he's stopping to rest.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.230
He got away. It all happened so fast.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.898
It happened kind of fast.

03:45.967 --> 03:47.978
What, I should have caught
him? He had a huge head start.

03:48.002 --> 03:50.169
Maybe spend a little less
time fooling with your apron.

03:50.238 --> 03:51.671
I can't run with it on, Teddy.

03:51.739 --> 03:53.339
Can't run so good with it off, either.

03:53.408 --> 03:55.675
Well, someone else could
have chased him, too, right?

03:55.743 --> 03:57.343
I was busy memorizing his face.

03:57.412 --> 03:59.211
Ooh, what'd you get? I'll make a sketch.

03:59.247 --> 04:01.414
Well, I was startled,
so I didn't get much.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.316
- Definitely two eyes.
- Okay.

04:03.384 --> 04:05.851
- Uh, what about a nose?
- Yeah, right in between the eyes

04:05.920 --> 04:07.720
- and down a little.
- Yeah, that checks out.

04:07.755 --> 04:08.888
That's the guy I saw, too.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.156
Oh, my God.

04:11.592 --> 04:13.426
Wow, that sawdust really travels back

04:13.494 --> 04:15.027
into the old respiratory system.

04:15.096 --> 04:18.096
But smooth.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.031
Yeah, sawdust with a stain chaser.

04:20.101 --> 04:21.767
At least there's no ventilation.

04:21.836 --> 04:23.002
This job stinks.

04:23.071 --> 04:25.705
Each smile I draw is a lie, a damn lie!

04:25.740 --> 04:27.434
Well, the first batch is done.

04:27.459 --> 04:29.608
Now it's time to turn
these Chucks into bucks.

04:29.723 --> 04:31.690
The real work.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.565
I'll take one.

04:34.590 --> 04:36.749
- I want one, too.
- You're gonna live with me now.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.218
- Take our money.
- You and I are great at this.

04:39.253 --> 04:40.786
I know.

04:40.855 --> 04:43.155
♪ Wood Chucks making bucks ♪

04:43.224 --> 04:46.892

04:46.961 --> 04:49.528

04:49.597 --> 04:51.230

04:51.265 --> 04:53.399
100 Wood Chucks sold. Wow!

04:53.468 --> 04:55.134
And we all worked our B's off.

04:55.203 --> 04:58.104
Yeah, like when Zeke brought in
cupcakes for Jocelyn's birthday.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.239
We worked overtime
to finish eating them.

05:00.308 --> 05:01.640
Not really.

05:01.709 --> 05:03.387
Hey, are there any Band-Aids over here?

05:03.411 --> 05:05.978
Oh, um, is something going on?

05:06.047 --> 05:07.546
We celebrated all our sales

05:07.571 --> 05:10.137
by investing our profits
in a SodaSpurt thingy.

05:10.162 --> 05:12.829
And we didn't want to invite...
I mean, um, disturb you guys

05:12.854 --> 05:15.254
'cause you seemed really in the
zone just making Wood Chucks.

05:15.289 --> 05:17.256
Do you see spots in the zone? If you do,

05:17.325 --> 05:19.291
- then I'm definitely in the zone.
- Quick question.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.504
What's going on...

05:20.528 --> 05:22.228
What...

05:22.296 --> 05:23.662
What...

05:23.731 --> 05:25.998
What... Damn it, Jocelyn!

05:26.067 --> 05:27.833
What? I'm trying to make it fizzy.

05:27.902 --> 05:29.635
I was doing my job.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.170
What's with these cubicles?

05:31.239 --> 05:33.172
You literally boxed us in back there.

05:33.241 --> 05:34.774
We tried the open floor plan.

05:34.842 --> 05:36.208
It just wasn't working.

05:36.244 --> 05:38.244
We don't want to get
sawdust in our soda.

05:38.312 --> 05:40.346
Okay, it just feels like
you're creating a division

05:40.371 --> 05:42.070
with these divisions.

05:42.183 --> 05:44.984
I mean, it's nice not having
to see Tammy anymore, but...

05:45.053 --> 05:48.064
Oh, I'm sorry, it's hard to
hear you from the other room.

05:48.089 --> 05:49.522
I'm so sorry.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.490
Boy, I really could use a...

05:51.526 --> 05:53.459
Dust mask.

05:53.528 --> 05:55.382
If every other class

05:55.407 --> 05:57.507
wasn't literally worse than a sweatshop,

05:57.532 --> 05:59.031
I'd transfer out of here so fast.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.367
Mr. Frond, do you think
we could switch jobs soon?

06:01.436 --> 06:03.969
Oh, sure, Tina, we'll just switch jobs.

06:04.082 --> 06:05.381
Like people never get stuck

06:05.406 --> 06:07.373
in the same job their whole career.

06:07.398 --> 06:09.498
I'm gonna go talk to those
guys. This is ridiculous.

06:09.711 --> 06:12.044
- Can I help you?
- I need to see Jimmy Jr.

06:12.113 --> 06:14.713
He's, like, super busy
in a meeting or something.

06:14.782 --> 06:17.183
Why don't you tell me what
it is, and I will tell him.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.385
Fine. We need dust masks
and Band-Aids and gloves

06:19.454 --> 06:21.720
and a timetable on when
we'll be switching jobs.

06:21.789 --> 06:24.233
So you're crabby. Did I get it all?

06:24.258 --> 06:25.724
Hey!

06:25.793 --> 06:27.359
You bought snacks, too?

06:27.428 --> 06:29.505
No, just chips and
chocolate-covered almonds

06:29.530 --> 06:31.397
and a second kind of
chocolate-covered almonds.

06:31.466 --> 06:33.010
Look, it seems like
the sanders and stainers

06:33.034 --> 06:34.211
are doing all the frickin' work

06:34.235 --> 06:35.875
while management sits
on their damn butts.

06:35.903 --> 06:38.737
Whoa, whoa, whoa, language. NSFW, girl.

06:38.806 --> 06:40.706
Huh. Maybe Tina has a point.

06:40.731 --> 06:42.641
- We should take turns.
- What? Hold up.

06:42.677 --> 06:45.298
- Tina, have an almond.
- I don't want an alm...

06:45.323 --> 06:47.090
- Mmm. So...
- And another.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.347
- Mmm.
- One more.

06:48.427 --> 06:49.826
Mmm. Which kind is that?

06:49.851 --> 06:51.050
Let's take a walk.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.119
You are raising some amazing points.

06:53.187 --> 06:54.398
I hope someone's writing them down.

06:54.422 --> 06:56.133
- I wrote them down.
- Oopsies. Well, there that went.

06:56.157 --> 06:58.968
So, maybe you could keep
all your smarty ideas going

06:58.993 --> 07:01.427
as our new sander and
stainer relations manager.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.874
- Manager?
- Mm-hmm. You'd be in here.

07:04.899 --> 07:06.699
This is kind of nice.

07:06.767 --> 07:09.268
Have a seat. The chair
is an exercise ball.

07:09.337 --> 07:10.703
Whoa.

07:10.771 --> 07:13.806
- Jocelyn, could you bring us two sodas?
- Okay!

07:13.875 --> 07:15.715
Did you just make a buzz
sound with your voice?

07:15.776 --> 07:17.710
Mm-hmm, I did. And so can you.

07:18.846 --> 07:19.923
- Feels good, right?
- Yeah.

07:19.947 --> 07:21.547
Sodas.

07:21.582 --> 07:23.516
Well, it's what's best
for the company, right?

07:23.541 --> 07:25.842
Exactly.

07:27.522 --> 07:29.255
- I don't believe it.
- Me either.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.091
An exercise ball for a
desk chair? What's next?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.971
By the way, Rudy, thank you
for letting me stand on you.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.904
No problem.

07:39.029 --> 07:41.747
And my Scotch tape. And, you
know, this cat calendar is mine,

07:41.772 --> 07:42.950
but I think I'm gonna leave it.

07:42.974 --> 07:44.707
Ugh. You're one of them now, Tina.

07:44.775 --> 07:45.875
You're a suit.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.309
And not a fun, frisky suit,

07:47.378 --> 07:48.677
like something Ellen would wear.

07:48.746 --> 07:49.879
Guys, this is a good thing.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.391
I'm gonna be your eyes
and ears over there,

07:51.415 --> 07:52.615
looking out for you.

07:52.683 --> 07:54.294
Like, weren't you whining
about something, Rudy?

07:54.318 --> 07:56.418
A dust mask. It only
sounded like whining

07:56.487 --> 07:58.320
because of my restricted windpipe.

07:58.389 --> 08:01.857
Right, so I guess I'll
be going next door now.

08:01.926 --> 08:04.904
Unless, surprise
good-bye party? Yes? No?

08:04.929 --> 08:06.629
- You've got to be kidding.
- Okay, then.

08:06.697 --> 08:09.164
Let's all stay in touch.
You said "mouse pad."

08:09.233 --> 08:11.433
- Dust mask!
- Right, right, right.

08:11.469 --> 08:13.502
So, in conclusion, we're eating snacks

08:13.571 --> 08:15.204
faster than we're making Wood Chucks.

08:15.273 --> 08:17.172
So, what I hear is we're doing our part.

08:17.241 --> 08:20.009
Yeah, the sanders and stainers
got to keep up with us.

08:20.077 --> 08:21.944
Well, if some of us
helped out over there...

08:22.013 --> 08:23.245
- Whoa. - Um...
-Do what?

08:23.281 --> 08:24.780
- Uh...
- I mean, not us.

08:24.849 --> 08:27.016
- Obviously, we're slammed.
- So slammed.

08:27.051 --> 08:28.884
Why don't they just make them faster?

08:28.953 --> 08:30.797
How long does it even take
to make a dumb Wood Chuck?

08:30.821 --> 08:32.321
Um, like, 20 minutes?

08:32.356 --> 08:34.256
So, if we cut that to ten minutes,

08:34.325 --> 08:37.559
instead of one Chuck, they could make...

08:38.485 --> 08:40.929
- Two?
- Whoa, math.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.376
I mean, they might
have some rough edges,

08:42.400 --> 08:43.677
but it's better than nothing, right?

08:43.701 --> 08:45.279
Yeah, we're all a work
in progress, right, J-Ju?

08:45.303 --> 08:46.702
- Get over here, come on.
- Aah.

08:46.771 --> 08:49.305
You know, if we cut
the ten minutes to...

08:49.373 --> 08:50.739
Five minutes?!

08:50.808 --> 08:52.252
So, good talk. I'm going to let you guys

08:52.276 --> 08:53.787
get crack-a-lacking.

08:53.811 --> 08:57.146
I was ready to be annoyed,
but that finger thing was cool.

08:57.181 --> 08:59.114
I don't know if I can go any faster.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.561
My little body is already breaking down.

09:01.586 --> 09:03.552
Well, there's only one thing to do.

09:03.621 --> 09:04.631
- Work harder.
- Half-ass it.

09:04.655 --> 09:06.121
Oh-oh, half-ass it.

09:06.157 --> 09:08.424
I don't know, that still
sounds like a lot of ass.

09:08.492 --> 09:10.159
So, quarter-ass it is.

09:10.227 --> 09:13.095
Gonna throw just a
little bit of my cheek in.

09:13.164 --> 09:15.831
♪ Ooh, quarter-assin' ♪

09:15.900 --> 09:18.767
♪ A little bit of the cheek,
a little bit of the cheek ♪

09:18.836 --> 09:21.437
♪ Ooh, quarter-assin' ♪

09:21.505 --> 09:24.840
♪ A little bit of the cheek,
a little bit of the cheek ♪

09:24.909 --> 09:27.576
♪ Ooh, quarter-assin' ♪

09:27.645 --> 09:29.945
♪ A little bit of the cheek. ♪

09:30.014 --> 09:32.581
Hey, guys, how was your
day? How's Tweentrepreneurs?

09:32.617 --> 09:34.294
I don't want to talk about it.

09:34.318 --> 09:36.251
Great. We're pushing a
lot of units, making bank.

09:36.287 --> 09:38.787
- How's Bob's Burgers?
- Um, excuse me?

09:38.856 --> 09:40.567
Are you making bank? How
many units are you pushing?

09:40.591 --> 09:42.636
Tell her you're pushing units.
Tell her you're making bank.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.660
Tina, you're-you're not
making sense right now.

09:44.729 --> 09:46.495
I know, so business-y.

09:46.564 --> 09:49.331
Let's go, Gene. Smells
like "entre-manure" in here.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.345
That was me, but also, yeah.

09:51.369 --> 09:53.402
Okay, Dad, you didn't ask,
but here are five things

09:53.437 --> 09:55.282
you could do right now
to improve your business.

09:55.306 --> 09:56.546
- Smaller burgers.
- Mm-hmm. Mm.

09:56.607 --> 09:58.251
Cook them ahead of time.
Keep them warm under a lamp.

09:58.275 --> 09:59.608
- Mm-mm. Mm.
- Raise prices.

09:59.677 --> 10:01.010
- Maybe buy a comb?
- Mm.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.645
You getting this, Bob? You taking notes?

10:02.713 --> 10:05.014
Tina, you're sounding kind
of like a business monster.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.349
I wouldn't say business
master, it's just common sense.

10:07.418 --> 10:08.717
I-I said business monster.

10:08.786 --> 10:10.226
Can we circle back on this next week?

10:10.254 --> 10:11.520
I've got to make some calls.

10:11.589 --> 10:13.122
Also, the spinning made me nauseous.

10:13.190 --> 10:14.723
Do you think she'd do our taxes?

10:14.792 --> 10:16.659
Wait, that customer in
the booth over there.

10:16.727 --> 10:18.027
I-Isn't that our
dine-and-dasher?

10:18.095 --> 10:19.495
I don't think so.

10:19.563 --> 10:21.797
Mm, yeah, he doesn't
look much like my sketch.

10:21.866 --> 10:23.232
Yeah, and this guy has a hat.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.767
Well, anyone could put on a hat.

10:24.835 --> 10:27.169
It takes time. You got to
find one that's flattering.

10:27.238 --> 10:28.537
- It's not that hard.
- This guy,

10:28.606 --> 10:30.239
he thinks he looks good in any hat.

10:30.307 --> 10:32.875
Anyway, we can't just accuse
him if we don't know for sure.

10:32.910 --> 10:34.810
That's true. Uh, why
don't you go over there

10:34.879 --> 10:36.045
and feel him out a little?

10:36.113 --> 10:37.312
- Be sly.
- You kidding?

10:37.381 --> 10:39.548
You're talking to Sly
and the Family Stallone.

10:39.617 --> 10:42.384
Hello! So, you look like a busy person.

10:42.453 --> 10:44.586
- You ever eat on the run?
- I'm sorry?

10:44.655 --> 10:46.021
You like Christmas carols?

10:46.057 --> 10:47.423
♪ Dashing through the snow. ♪

10:47.458 --> 10:49.591
You like that one?
The one about dashing?

10:49.660 --> 10:51.960
- She's great at this.
- Uh, is-is something the matter?

10:51.996 --> 10:54.396
All right, we had a
dine-and-dasher the other day,

10:54.465 --> 10:56.098
and you look a little bit like him.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.367
- The guy had a hat and everything?
- No, no hat.

10:58.402 --> 10:59.780
Oh, well, I can see
why you'd be concerned.

10:59.804 --> 11:01.648
But if it was
me, I would have to be crazy

11:01.672 --> 11:02.672
to come back, right?

11:02.740 --> 11:04.039
I mean, uh, totally crazy.

11:04.108 --> 11:05.574
I'm sorry.

11:05.643 --> 11:07.576
I guess you got one of those faces

11:07.645 --> 11:09.578
where you look like
other people, like owls.

11:09.647 --> 11:11.158
All owls look the same to me.

11:11.182 --> 11:12.715
Those big eyes.

11:12.783 --> 11:14.249
Oh, sure. You know, it's fine.

11:14.318 --> 11:16.752
Oh, hope you enjoyed your
meal. Here's your check.

11:16.821 --> 11:18.020
- It's not him.
- Aah!

11:18.089 --> 11:20.122
- Okay, it's him.
- Damn it!

11:20.191 --> 11:21.724
Hi, guys. Just popping in.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.225
We couldn't finish these next door,

11:23.294 --> 11:25.294
so, naturally, I thought of you.

11:25.329 --> 11:27.463
Oh really, Tina? A third of a muffin?

11:27.531 --> 11:29.798
Thank you so much.

11:29.867 --> 11:32.434
It's raisin something or
other. It's not good. Anyway,

11:32.503 --> 11:34.970
we've had a ton of complaints
about splinters, so...

11:35.039 --> 11:36.772
I'm doing my best.

11:36.807 --> 11:38.440
Any progress on my dust mask?

11:38.509 --> 11:40.242
Working on it, Rudy!

11:40.277 --> 11:42.222
What's it gonna take to get
more work out of you guys?

11:42.246 --> 11:44.046
I've tried the carrot,
I've tried the stick.

11:44.081 --> 11:45.647
And you even tried carrot sticks.

11:45.716 --> 11:48.417
- That was a dark day.
- I'm feeling dizzy.

11:48.486 --> 11:50.297
Pull your shirt over your
mouth and keep going, Rudy.

11:50.321 --> 11:51.653
Oh, good idea.

11:51.722 --> 11:53.622
Tina, you are this close to a walkout.

11:53.657 --> 11:55.991
Yeah, except walking also
sounds like too much work.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.459
Where am I?!

11:57.528 --> 11:59.428
Everything looks like a Wood Chuck!

11:59.497 --> 12:01.312
You broke Rudy, Tina!

12:01.337 --> 12:02.631
Rudy, you're fine!

12:02.700 --> 12:04.633
Why is that Wood Chuck saying I'm fine?!

12:04.702 --> 12:07.336
That's it! We're out. We're on strike.

12:07.404 --> 12:09.638
Wait. What? Hey, we-we-we
can work this out.

12:09.707 --> 12:11.787
I think I can get you guys,
uh, SodaSpurt privileges.

12:11.842 --> 12:14.409
Maybe-maybe not flavored,
but-but still, uh, bubbles.

12:14.478 --> 12:16.678
Put your bubbles in
your butt! Come on, guys.

12:16.747 --> 12:18.614
Fine! Where you gonna
go with your skills?

12:18.682 --> 12:20.949
One of the other ten Wood
Chuck factories in town?

12:21.018 --> 12:23.152
Oh, that's right. We're the only one!

12:23.220 --> 12:25.320
Guys, nobody's buying
Wood Chucks anymore.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.246
I didn't make a sales chart, but
if I did, it would go like this.

12:30.394 --> 12:31.960
Yeah. What happened to quality control?

12:32.029 --> 12:34.663
Instead of a cute smile,
this one says "Tina's a butt."

12:34.688 --> 12:37.288
This isn't Wood Chuck! I
wouldn't hang out with this!

12:37.313 --> 12:39.011
Let's not sugarcoat it.

12:39.036 --> 12:40.469
Wood Chuck is dead.

12:40.538 --> 12:42.271
It's a greasy, googly patch on the road.

12:42.339 --> 12:42.873
Dang.

12:42.898 --> 12:44.497
Also, our entire
labor force just quit.

12:44.542 --> 12:47.309
But to keep snacks
coming, we need product.

12:47.344 --> 12:49.278
So we turn the page... to Wood Chuck 2.

12:49.346 --> 12:51.346
Everything kids loved about Wood Chuck 1

12:51.382 --> 12:53.182
in a smaller package we don't even sand.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.573
I've been working on it in secret.

12:54.598 --> 12:56.061
I mean, it only took a minute,

12:56.086 --> 12:57.497
so it wasn't hard to not tell anyone.

12:57.521 --> 12:59.621
Wood Chuck? More like Wood Yuck.

12:59.690 --> 13:01.523
Doesn't matter. It's
new. We say it's cool.

13:01.559 --> 13:03.325
Best of all, it sells for half price.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.171
How can we sell it for half price?

13:05.196 --> 13:07.095
By squeezing our suppliers.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.064
You got big ones, coming in here,

13:09.133 --> 13:11.033
demanding cut-rate googly eye prices.

13:11.101 --> 13:12.734
Cajones!

13:12.759 --> 13:15.126
You're gonna do it, too,
dying mom-and-pop shop,

13:15.151 --> 13:18.184
or I take my business to the
craft superstore in Bog Harbor.

13:18.209 --> 13:20.309
Yarn Barn? On the outside,
it's shaped like a barn,

13:20.377 --> 13:22.344
but on the inside, it
looks like a normal store.

13:22.379 --> 13:23.846
It's ridiculous!

13:23.881 --> 13:25.681
- Well, can't wait to see it.
- Yeah, bye.

13:25.749 --> 13:27.850
All right, fine, but
if you want bulk prices,

13:27.918 --> 13:29.384
you take bulk quantity.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.187
5,000 googlies, a hundred
dollars, no returns!

13:32.256 --> 13:34.923
Gulp. I mean, not gulp. Confident.
Can we get them on credit?

13:34.992 --> 13:37.092
Depends. Are you
familiar with the concept

13:37.117 --> 13:38.971
of jacked-up interest rates?

13:38.996 --> 13:40.562
- No.
- Then sign here.

13:40.631 --> 13:42.664
I don't know, Tina.
That's, like, a big risk

13:42.700 --> 13:44.533
on something I still
wouldn't hang out with.

13:44.568 --> 13:45.934
I believe in Wood Chuck 2.

13:46.003 --> 13:47.703
I mean, I believe
people will buy anything

13:47.771 --> 13:50.506
with a higher number than
the model that came before it.

13:52.811 --> 13:55.077
Huh. Should we have called
it Wood Chuck Gold Series?

13:55.145 --> 13:57.212
- In wood?
- Ooh, I want that.

13:57.248 --> 13:59.114
Mr. Frond, hypothetically,
what would happen

13:59.149 --> 14:01.516
if the Tweentrepreneurs had
a really big googly eye bill

14:01.585 --> 14:02.951
they couldn't pay?

14:03.020 --> 14:05.254
You'd be bankrupt,
which happens. No shame.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.623
- Oh, that's not so bad.
- You'd also get an "F",

14:07.691 --> 14:09.424
and "Terrible at
business" would be placed

14:09.493 --> 14:11.026
- on your permanent record.
- Oh.

14:11.061 --> 14:12.895
And you're not a real
company, so you couldn't

14:12.963 --> 14:15.075
really declare bankruptcy,
so you'd have to pay your bill

14:15.099 --> 14:17.032
- or be criminally liable.
- Oh, God!

14:17.101 --> 14:19.582
But, Tina, relax. Your
question was hypothetical.

14:19.607 --> 14:20.569
Right.

14:20.638 --> 14:23.105
Whoa. Tina burned this
crappy company to the ground.

14:23.173 --> 14:25.660
Yeah, where did she go to school?

14:25.685 --> 14:27.418
Oh. Where we do.

14:30.163 --> 14:32.388
Darn it, Tina! It's your
fault we're flunking.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.313
Now I'll never get into the Ivan League.

14:34.382 --> 14:36.048
Okay, okay, got a little distracted.

14:36.117 --> 14:38.217
There were so many
office birthday parties!

14:38.286 --> 14:40.491
Boy, I don't know what
Edith and Harold are gonna do

14:40.516 --> 14:42.661
when you tell 'em you don't
have their googly eye money.

14:42.686 --> 14:45.119
I heard Edith put a knitting
needle through a man's hand

14:45.144 --> 14:47.132
just because he didn't
have exact change.

14:47.157 --> 14:49.592
Well, maybe they'll
be super cool about it?

14:49.617 --> 14:51.851
Yeah, I wouldn't count on that.

14:54.497 --> 14:57.899
Ugh...

14:58.795 --> 15:01.457
It's not our fault we got
double dined-and-dashed, Bob.

15:01.482 --> 15:02.804
It's like fool me once, shame on you.

15:02.872 --> 15:06.374
Fool me twice, guess where
the shame is now? Still you!

15:06.443 --> 15:07.742
I don't think that's how it goes.

15:07.777 --> 15:09.577
- Hi there.
- Oh, my God.

15:09.613 --> 15:10.878
Now this is chutzpah.

15:10.914 --> 15:13.014
I'm going around the
neighborhood as a courtesy.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.850
My identical twin brother
has been dining and dashing

15:15.919 --> 15:17.752
in restaurants all over town.

15:17.787 --> 15:19.454
Your-your identical twin brother?

15:19.522 --> 15:21.289
Oh, yes... Gary. He's a bad seed.

15:21.358 --> 15:23.825
And he makes life very
difficult for me, the good seed.

15:23.893 --> 15:25.593
How stupid do you think we are?

15:25.662 --> 15:27.795
Aw, it sounds like
he's been here already.

15:27.831 --> 15:29.497
He was. You were!

15:29.566 --> 15:31.899
We're not buying your
evil twin brother... hooey.

15:31.968 --> 15:33.434
Look, I was trying to do you a favor.

15:33.503 --> 15:35.470
I'm not even here to eat, although...

15:35.538 --> 15:37.605
- I am a little bit hungry.
- Aha.

15:37.674 --> 15:39.252
Okay, I get it. You
don't want to serve me.

15:39.276 --> 15:41.109
I'll tell you what.
I'll prepay. Here's $20.

15:41.177 --> 15:43.478
- What can go wrong, huh?
- Okay.

15:43.546 --> 15:45.179
That was amazing.

15:45.215 --> 15:47.482
- Let's settle up. How much?
- Seven dollars.

15:47.550 --> 15:49.684
Great. Let's throw a
two-dollar tip on there.

15:49.753 --> 15:51.519
So what does that make now? Nine?

15:51.554 --> 15:53.621
Okay, just give me, uh,
nine back from that 20.

15:53.690 --> 15:55.723
- Uh, uh, right.
- Nine from 20.

15:55.792 --> 15:58.359
And seven, eight,
nine, and... we're good.

15:58.428 --> 16:01.115
Wait. I think we did that backwards.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.940
Uh, I-I-I thought something was wrong.

16:03.009 --> 16:05.342
Right, I was supposed 
to give you the nine.

16:05.411 --> 16:07.444
Sorry. You have my 20. I have your nine.

16:07.513 --> 16:09.046
You're not trying to scam me, are you?

16:09.115 --> 16:10.592
- Nah, nah.
- No, we're not.

16:10.616 --> 16:11.827
Okay, wait, um, so I give you your nine,

16:11.852 --> 16:12.905
and you give me my 20.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.597
Right. No, I... Sorry. I got it.

16:14.656 --> 16:16.093
Here we go. Nine back to
you, and now we're square.

16:16.118 --> 16:17.350
- Okay.
- And bye.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.769
- Hey, watch out for my brother.
- We will.

16:19.794 --> 16:22.195
Ugh. Imagine having a brother like that.

16:22.264 --> 16:25.952
Seven, tip makes nine.
His 20, my... my nine.

16:25.977 --> 16:29.035
Damn it! He came in with
20, he left with 20, Lin.

16:29.104 --> 16:30.603
He got a free meal.

16:30.639 --> 16:33.239
Both twins are evil. Their poor mother.

16:33.308 --> 16:36.609
So we've opened up this
emergency meeting to everyone,

16:36.678 --> 16:38.623
even the kids from the
other side of the cardboard.

16:38.647 --> 16:40.580
There's probably a
nicer way of saying that.

16:40.649 --> 16:42.749
Oh, now we're invited to the meetings.

16:42.817 --> 16:44.996
When the company's in the
toilet and the snacks are gone.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.252
The snacks are gone?!

16:46.321 --> 16:47.687
We got to do something fast.

16:47.712 --> 16:49.089
We're up to our googly eyeballs in debt!

16:49.114 --> 16:51.381
- How bad is it?
- That's pretty bad.

16:51.406 --> 16:54.216
Oh, sorry, kids. I
didn't see you in here.

16:54.496 --> 16:57.530
Now, how can we raise some cash
from these horrible Wood Chucks?

16:57.566 --> 16:59.732
Louise, you want to kick things off

16:59.801 --> 17:01.100
with the... perfect idea?

17:01.169 --> 17:03.903
Uh-uh. You guys created
this mess, not us.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.939
I will, however, bless this mess.

17:06.007 --> 17:07.674
You'll never unload these things.

17:07.742 --> 17:10.042
You might as well try to
sell the whole stupid company.

17:10.078 --> 17:11.556
Yes, that's it! Unload the whole company

17:11.579 --> 17:12.897
on some unsuspecting fool.

17:12.923 --> 17:15.114
Ugh! I didn't mean to
give you a real idea.

17:15.138 --> 17:17.239
- Ugh, but who?
- Yeah. Ha-ha.

17:17.263 --> 17:18.952
Good luck finding your fool.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.665
You think the streets
are crawling with Teddys?

17:20.689 --> 17:23.156
- Aha!
- No, I did it again!

17:23.181 --> 17:25.135
So what's this investment opportunity?

17:25.160 --> 17:27.223
- Spoiler alert. I want in.
- Good.

17:27.248 --> 17:29.006
I've never gotten in on the
ground floor of anything.

17:29.030 --> 17:31.067
I always chickened out. Not this time.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.424
Okay, this is our product.

17:32.449 --> 17:35.117
Don't know what this is,
and there's a big splinter in my hand.

17:35.142 --> 17:36.224
Not gonna let that bother me.

17:36.249 --> 17:38.450
By the way, we're not telling my
mom and dad about you investing.

17:38.475 --> 17:39.741
That raises red flags,

17:39.756 --> 17:41.422
like maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

17:41.447 --> 17:43.647
But I'm gonna quash that
feeling so I don't miss out.

17:43.727 --> 17:45.326
- Let's do it.
- Ah, Tina.

17:45.395 --> 17:47.362
- There you are.
- So you weren't going out

17:47.430 --> 17:49.030
- to look at the foliage.
- Teddy,

17:49.055 --> 17:51.121
don't invest; the company's a stinker.

17:51.234 --> 17:52.533
Go away, you guys.

17:52.569 --> 17:54.669
Teddy, I'm warning you,
you'd be wasting your money.

17:54.694 --> 17:56.160
You got to waste money to make money.

17:56.239 --> 17:57.972
- Teddy!
- You're Bob's kid,

17:58.041 --> 18:00.019
and if your company is
anything like Bob's Burgers,

18:00.043 --> 18:02.246
I know I'm getting in
on something special.

18:02.271 --> 18:03.804
So here's my hundred dollars.

18:05.020 --> 18:08.409
I think that's the sound
of your soul leaving your body.

18:11.301 --> 18:13.487
Teddy, I can't do it. Louise is right.

18:13.512 --> 18:15.979
The company is crap. We make
a dangerous, worthless product.

18:16.048 --> 18:18.015
- Like shampoo.
- Companies have growing pains.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.950
- Perfectly normal.
- Don't you get it?

18:20.019 --> 18:22.085
I was conning you.
I'm a business monster.

18:22.154 --> 18:24.821
Wow. I don't know what to say,
except that kind of honesty...

18:24.890 --> 18:26.957
I've never believed in
you more than right now.

18:27.026 --> 18:28.358
Take your money back, damn it!

18:28.427 --> 18:30.227
I'm just gonna give you more, Tina!

18:30.650 --> 18:32.875
Teddy did not want to
take that money back.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.164
We did what we had to do.

18:34.233 --> 18:36.193
Then everybody was staring,
like they'd never seen

18:36.235 --> 18:37.968
three kids holding a crying man down,

18:38.037 --> 18:39.536
shoving money in his pants.

18:39.605 --> 18:40.804
I'm really sorry, guys.

18:40.873 --> 18:42.083
I don't know what got into me before.

18:42.107 --> 18:44.341
All I saw were dollar signs and snacks.

18:44.410 --> 18:46.543
You flew too close to the Sun Chips.

18:46.612 --> 18:49.212
You know, I think I'd rather
be a good bad businessperson,

18:49.237 --> 18:51.638
like Dad, than a bad
good businessperson.

18:51.750 --> 18:52.750
Does that make sense?

18:52.818 --> 18:54.151
Is this one of those riddles

18:54.219 --> 18:55.819
where it turns out you're your own son?

18:55.888 --> 18:57.921
Gene, I-I think you
sat on some googly eyes.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.982
That's okay, I'm used
to eyes on my butt.

19:00.007 --> 19:01.558
Oh, my God, guys.

19:01.627 --> 19:03.738
We never should have made
Wood Chucks in the first place.

19:03.762 --> 19:05.062
We should have made...

19:05.097 --> 19:06.663
- Could Chucks.
- Do what Chucks?

19:06.732 --> 19:09.399
Yeah, I'm not fol... I don't...
I'm not following this.

19:09.435 --> 19:11.535
"Could Chucks," 'cause
they could be anything.

19:11.604 --> 19:12.836
Googly eyes can go anywhere.

19:12.905 --> 19:14.738
Like... Phone Chuck?

19:14.807 --> 19:16.039
Inhaler Chuck.

19:16.075 --> 19:17.708
Zeke Chuck.

19:17.743 --> 19:19.343
We can sell them for 25 cents a pair,

19:19.411 --> 19:20.589
pay off our debt to Reflections,

19:20.613 --> 19:21.845
and still make a small profit.

19:21.914 --> 19:23.614
Well, let's get to selling, people.

19:23.639 --> 19:25.973
But there's one thing
we got to do first.

19:26.051 --> 19:28.051
- Tear down these walls!
- Whoa, whoa.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.220
But then it will look
like you're as good as me.

19:30.289 --> 19:32.189
Oh, you're still vice president, Tammy.

19:32.224 --> 19:34.564
- Oh, phew.
- The rest of us are presidents.

19:34.589 --> 19:35.525
What?!

19:35.594 --> 19:36.860
So, you sold off

19:36.929 --> 19:37.995
all your googly eyes,

19:38.063 --> 19:39.730
paid off Edith and
Harold, and broke even?

19:39.765 --> 19:41.098
- Yep.
- Aw.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.233
I'm proud of my Tweentrepreneurs.

19:43.302 --> 19:44.935
And Mr. Frond gave us a B-minus.

19:45.004 --> 19:47.738
Oh, my God, a B-minus?
That's a Belcher A.

19:47.806 --> 19:50.040
And I saved two googlies so
I can put 'em on my bosom,

19:50.109 --> 19:52.075
and I can say, "My eyes are down here!"

19:52.144 --> 19:53.710
Hi. It's me.

19:53.779 --> 19:54.878
Unbelievable.

19:54.954 --> 19:56.520
- I-I know, I know.
- You see?

19:56.548 --> 19:58.315
This is why we need a
net from the ceiling.

19:58.384 --> 19:59.716
So when things like this happen,

19:59.785 --> 20:01.129
we could drop a net from the ceiling.

20:01.153 --> 20:02.953
No, please. I did it, I'm sorry.

20:02.988 --> 20:04.221
But your food is so good.

20:04.289 --> 20:05.877
I've never hit a place three times.

20:05.902 --> 20:07.368
Honestly, it's a compliment.

20:07.393 --> 20:10.450
You robbed us three times.
That's not a compliment.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.396
Look, here's all the
money I owe you, I just...

20:12.464 --> 20:15.065
I want to be able to come
here as a real customer.

20:15.134 --> 20:17.134
You want to be a real customer?

20:17.169 --> 20:19.603
I'm tired of dashing,
Bob. Can we start over?

20:19.672 --> 20:22.105
All right, ground rules.

20:22.174 --> 20:23.718
You sit on this stool,
away from the door

20:23.742 --> 20:26.010
- and cash register.
- You don't touch anything.

20:26.051 --> 20:28.679
Louise and Gene are gonna duct
tape your hands and your feet.

20:28.747 --> 20:29.980
That seems fair. No problem.

20:30.015 --> 20:31.381
I don't even know what's happening,

20:31.450 --> 20:32.949
- but I love it.
- Pay first.

20:33.062 --> 20:35.396
Push your wallet across
the counter with your face.

20:35.421 --> 20:36.665
And don't talk while we make change.

20:36.689 --> 20:38.789
In fact, we're not even
making change, it's all tip.

20:38.857 --> 20:41.324
I say we do this for
all our customers now.

20:41.393 --> 20:42.959
We'll feed you your burger.

20:43.028 --> 20:45.128
Hi, I'm Tina. I'll be your feeder today.

20:45.197 --> 20:46.574
Would you like me to pretend your food

20:46.598 --> 20:48.209
-is some sort of airplane or train?
- Train, please.

20:48.233 --> 20:49.477
You're a good businessman, Dad.

20:49.501 --> 20:50.447
Thank you, Tina.
