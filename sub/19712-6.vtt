WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:06.171
Fargo.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.474
<i>All new Wednesdays at 10:00.</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:10.843
<i>Starts April 19 on FX.</i>

00:12.178 --> 00:14.246
<i>FX presents</i> The Americans.

00:18.451 --> 00:20.052
<i>Previously on "The Americans"...</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:27.059
We need to talk
in private... soon.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.630
<i>She's working for us.</i>

00:31.632 --> 00:33.465
You remember three years ago,

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
when that KGB officer
was killed?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.202
<i>I</i> shot him.

00:37.204 --> 00:42.007
If the CIA uses the tape
I made to blackmail Burov,

00:42.009 --> 00:43.042
I will go public.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.144
So, I have interview tomorrow.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.512
That's great.

00:46.514 --> 00:50.049
If she gets a job
teaching Russian at the CIA...

00:50.051 --> 00:51.483
There's a chance we could get

00:51.485 --> 00:53.519
every officer they're training

00:53.521 --> 00:54.720
for Moscow.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.260
His mother defected,
he got himself arrested,

01:01.262 --> 01:04.229
and now he's come here to see
a father he's never met.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.098
You don't trust Philip.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.500
He already has
entries in his file

01:08.502 --> 01:10.169
that don't look good.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.737
He's his son.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.673
I want see father.

01:14.675 --> 01:19.011
It would put him
in terrible danger.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.481
You cannot see him.

01:30.056 --> 01:33.092
But then, what was Morozov doing
at that greenhouse?

01:33.094 --> 01:35.461
They're using strains of wheat
from all over the world,

01:35.463 --> 01:39.264
and no one knows more
about Soviet wheat than Morozov.

01:39.266 --> 01:43.235
And Stobert just wants to end
world hunger...

01:43.237 --> 01:45.471
Like miss America.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.839
Jesus.

01:48.708 --> 01:53.312
So, the laboratory worker...
How's Philip taking it?

01:53.314 --> 01:54.379
He'll be fine.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.282
How's he taking it, Elizabeth?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.084
The same as me...
It's upsetting.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.385
For me, too.

02:04.124 --> 02:08.092
Well, if they've come up with
some kind of super wheat,

02:08.095 --> 02:10.729
think what getting our hands
on it could mean to us.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.297
No more shortages.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.967
No more buying grain
from the west.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.469
We could make it right.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.738
In that greenhouse,
everything was dying

02:19.740 --> 02:21.173
except right in the middle.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.742
There was
this strong, healthy wheat.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.277
Good.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.479
That's good.
We'll start there.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.149
Why don't we get photographs
of the greenhouse?

02:30.151 --> 02:32.518
Make sure nothing has changed.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.820
I'll get it taken care of.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.356
You two stay
with Stobert and Kemp.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.433
I'm sorry you're spread so thin.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.002
It's...

02:52.772 --> 02:54.673
it's part of the job, I know.

02:56.809 --> 02:58.243
But now...

03:04.384 --> 03:07.386
Is something wrong with me?

03:09.056 --> 03:10.689
It's a long career.

03:12.859 --> 03:17.262
And there is nothing wrong
with you... ever.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.370
Here.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.239
This one will be easy.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.243
Are <i> you</i> all right?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.880
Oh, yes.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.749
I'm just tired.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.218
And old.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.687 --> 04:16.454
How's the harder math going?

04:16.457 --> 04:17.923
Easy.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.391
You'll be running
the travel agency soon.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.226
We'll be working for <i> you.</i>

04:21.228 --> 04:23.929
I'm not really interested in
the travel-agency business, dad.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.898
He's not interested
in the travel business.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.700
I guess he has bigger plans.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.035
Like what?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.937
I don't know.
Who knows?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.641
Nothing wrong with
running your own business.

04:42.248 --> 04:45.317
Gabriel asked me
how you took the news

04:45.319 --> 04:47.753
about the guy in the lab.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.087
What'd you tell him?

04:49.089 --> 04:50.455
I said you're fine.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.359
<i>Are</i> you fine?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.131
Are <i> you?</i>

05:01.434 --> 05:02.901
I think about it.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.472
They know you.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.774
They're gonna need to know...

05:08.776 --> 05:11.510
I'll do my job.
I've always done it.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.644
I know.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.384
We can still do some good
with this.

05:24.357 --> 05:28.093
He gave me something else
for when I get back from Topeka.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.761
Should be short.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.930
Some files from a psychiatrist.

06:14.807 --> 06:20.545
My father used to
bring home all this stuff.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.449
We didn't have anything.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.654
And now we have everything.

06:29.656 --> 06:32.424
It's so strange sometimes.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.563
I know.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.557
Sorry to bother you,
Ms. Kovalenko.

07:05.559 --> 07:09.694
We're with the federal bureau
of investigation.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.532
Which one's yours?

07:15.535 --> 07:16.635
In the blue jacket.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.605
That's a cute kid.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.773
Thank you.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.413
Might be a lot of opportunities
for him in America one day.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.882
It's something we can talk
about, if you're interested.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.887
Talking to you is not safe.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.123
You're not being watched.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.991
You know it for sure?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.660
How?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.061
We checked.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.132
But you're right.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.468
There <i> are</i> risks.

07:49.470 --> 07:54.239
There are real, long-term things
we can offer you.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.674
And your son, too.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.684
It's very difficult.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.185
I understand.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.827
Why don't you think about it?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.704
This is a private line.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.939
You can call anytime.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.159
You're softer today.

08:49.496 --> 08:52.330
What am I normally...
Crusty?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.400
No, I just...

08:57.571 --> 09:00.805
I felt something different.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.707
We're getting to know
each other.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.376
I wouldn't go that far.

09:07.513 --> 09:10.549
I feel like
there's a whole other you

09:10.551 --> 09:13.718
I don't know at all.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.720
I'm in fashion.
I'm not that deep.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.390
I don't buy that for a minute.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.425
No, really,
I'm, like, barely thinking

09:20.427 --> 09:21.760
about anything right now.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.762
Really? <i> I</i> am.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.730
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.567
Because even though you're
in bed with a naked woman,

09:28.569 --> 09:31.603
I bet you there is some part
of your brain

09:31.605 --> 09:34.172
that's just thinking
about your super wheat,

09:34.174 --> 09:36.441
or whatever it is.

09:41.681 --> 09:42.747
Stick out your tongue.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.783
What?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.285
Come on.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.759
Ah, just what I thought.
Just what I thought.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.794
Red tip.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.129
Indicates heart heat.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.564
You can put that thing away now.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.633
What are you talking about?

10:01.635 --> 10:05.036
It's Chinese medicine.
It's thousands of years old.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.605
I learned about it in Nepal.

10:06.607 --> 10:10.375
Red tongue tip
means emotional turmoil...

10:10.377 --> 10:11.876
Heart heat.

10:11.878 --> 10:15.614
Blocks the, uh...
Blocks the chi.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.782
What do you do to relax?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.952
Uh... Not much,
as you can tell.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.987
Mm-hmm.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.457
Okay.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.875
It's tai chi.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.246
Come on.

10:49.615 --> 10:50.915
Then I would have to
get out of bed.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.183
Mm-hmm.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.507
Okay.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.709
Here.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.577
Follow my movements.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.739
You're doing great.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.388
He's home.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.257
They met him at the airport.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.926
And...?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.261
They're going to give him
his old job back.

12:12.765 --> 12:15.734
He'll be fine.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.969
The look on his face
when he left.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.574
Philip gets that look sometimes,
when he's troubled.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.878
Is Philip troubled now?

12:26.880 --> 12:30.482
Well, I don't think
he's particularly happy.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.618
Has he <i> ever</i> been?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.161
I've never lied to them before.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.834
He's lied to <i> you.</i>

12:51.937 --> 12:54.405
You did the right thing.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.437
So, there are guards inside,
and we don't know

16:46.439 --> 16:47.839
what kind of countersurveillance

16:47.841 --> 16:49.173
the CIA might have
on the building.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.842
So, we go again
Friday this week,

16:50.844 --> 16:52.010
Monday, Wednesday, Friday next.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.644
No Thursdays, right?
Right.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.446
She doesn't work Thursdays
or weekends.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.015
The important times for us

16:57.017 --> 16:58.349
are when she goes to work
and when she leaves.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.051
Anytime you get a picture
of her with someone,

17:00.053 --> 17:01.686
we might be getting
one of her students.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.021
Okay.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.055
If you pass by
and miss the shot,

17:04.057 --> 17:05.556
don't circle back.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.991
And don't shoot
out of a back window.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.893
It is not worth the risk.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.028
Okay?

17:11.196 --> 17:12.696
Mom!

17:12.699 --> 17:14.098
Coming.

17:20.472 --> 17:22.140
Mom, this is Nancy Norton.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.174
Hi.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.009
She's a Mary Kay
beauty consultant.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.810
I see where your daughter
gets such beautiful skin.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.813
Look at her, mom.
She's 62.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.382
Mary Kay cosmetics
and good genes

17:31.384 --> 17:33.217
are the key to my vibrant skin.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.020
I like to say Mary Kay
can't change your genes...

17:36.022 --> 17:38.890
Not that you gals need any help
in that department...

17:38.892 --> 17:41.692
But our rich, creamy foundation
will seal in moisture

17:41.694 --> 17:44.896
and keep your skin
silky, smooth, and sassy.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.098
I'm sorry, but now
is not such a good time.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.067
Well, here's a sample
of a skin-care product

17:49.069 --> 17:52.036
I've been using
for almost 15 years.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.204
"Day radiance."

17:53.206 --> 17:54.539
If you take care
of your skin, dear,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.274
your skin will take care of <i> you.</i>

17:56.276 --> 17:58.076
Thank you, but like I
said... I understand.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.545
I could come back another time

18:00.547 --> 18:02.246
and host an in-home
beauty demonstration

18:02.248 --> 18:03.881
for you
and some of your friends.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.516
You get to keep
a ton of samples,

18:05.518 --> 18:06.751
and the makeover is free.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.086
I'm sorry, but no.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.253
No problem.
Of course.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.923
Call me if you change your mind.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.197
You want this?

18:19.199 --> 18:20.331
Oh, no, thanks.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.834
Mom.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.638
You weren't that nice to her.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.207
Well, we weren't
gonna buy anything.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.442
Being nice would just be
a waste of her time.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.116
Yeah, I-i guess so.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.148
They're passing by this Friday,

19:10.150 --> 19:11.482
and then they'll skip
the next one.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.017
They'll do two Fridays
out of every three.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.485
All right.
What else?

19:14.487 --> 19:17.955
We'll see if Tuan can find out
whether her hours vary,

19:17.957 --> 19:20.992
whether she brings her own lunch
or goes out.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.328
Well, that all sounds good.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.797
I can't tell you
how thrilled the center is.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.132
Good.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.534
Anything on the greenhouse?

19:29.536 --> 19:33.271
Yes. We should have something
within the week.

19:38.944 --> 19:40.178
All right.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.082
Hold on.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.588
I have to talk to you.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.868
I'm going home.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.136
What?

20:06.238 --> 20:07.838
Did something happen?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.407
No.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.076
It's just time.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.245
Gabriel...

20:14.247 --> 20:15.646
If... if it's me...

20:15.648 --> 20:17.548
I-I know
I've been hard to deal with.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.817
No, it's not you.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.652
I'm just ready to go home.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.891
You don't need me anymore.
You have each other.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.196
But, Philip,
as long as you're here,

20:32.198 --> 20:35.566
the center is going to continue
to be concerned about you.

20:37.002 --> 20:41.339
Once they start worrying
about somebody, they never stop.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.441
And now, the lab.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.578
And, to be honest, I'm worried.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.348
You've seen too much.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.749
You've <i> done</i> too much.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.657
I'll miss you terribly.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.209
Hey.
Please sign in.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.846
So, what brings you here,
Ms. Sinclair?

23:36.782 --> 23:39.617
Well, a friend of mine...
Terry...

23:39.619 --> 23:42.553
Had seen a psychiatrist
a couple of years ago,

23:42.555 --> 23:48.759
and she was
having some... Problems.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.029
Issues, I-i guess
is what you say.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.033
And she said it helped.

24:00.305 --> 24:06.477
I'm... Not really sure
what I'm supposed to say.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.279
Whatever you feel like.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.513
Okay.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.852
Um...

24:17.989 --> 24:23.327
Well, a few months ago,
I... Got mugged.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.095
Mm.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.332
I was in a parking lot at night,

24:28.334 --> 24:31.435
and there were these two men.

24:31.437 --> 24:35.439
They were homeless, and...

24:35.441 --> 24:37.341
One had a knife.

24:37.343 --> 24:41.812
And... They took my purse,
and...

24:44.583 --> 24:46.717
I thought they were going to...

24:48.153 --> 24:52.323
But then someone came along,
and they ran away.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.460
That's very frightening.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.529
Yes, I'm very lucky,
and I know that.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.331
Um...

25:02.267 --> 25:07.505
I-I have been taking
these... Karate classes.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.541
Do you think that's stupid?

25:10.543 --> 25:12.042
Not at all.

25:16.515 --> 25:22.486
I guess I just...
Want to feel...

25:22.488 --> 25:24.188
Like I did before.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.623
Like nothing happened.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.629
Something big happened.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.697
You went through a trauma.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.533
Trauma?

25:35.535 --> 25:36.567
I don't know.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.302
Um...

25:38.304 --> 25:40.704
A lot of people think
that when something bad happens,

25:40.706 --> 25:46.143
the best thing to do is just
keep going, keep it to yourself.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.645
That doesn't work so well.

25:56.187 --> 25:57.888
Hi, Elizabeth.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.657
Hey.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.433
How was your appointment?

26:09.435 --> 26:13.904
He's, uh, got file cabinets
in his office with basic locks.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.739
What'd you talk about?

26:15.741 --> 26:18.242
Mm.
This and that.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.743
He ask you about your dreams?

26:20.946 --> 26:22.746
I thought that's what they like
to talk about.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.416
Hmm.
Not this one.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.584
Hmm.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.827
I can't believe he's leaving.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.535
Do you know something about this
that I don't?

26:45.770 --> 26:46.837
Like what?

26:50.809 --> 26:53.777
He seems tired.

26:53.779 --> 26:57.948
But I feel like there's
something he's not telling us.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.951
I mean, if he were sick,
he would tell us, wouldn't he?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.453
I guess so.

27:07.258 --> 27:09.293
I've been thinking more about...

27:10.730 --> 27:15.265
There... Were these men
in Tobolsk

27:15.267 --> 27:18.235
who didn't like us...
Me or my brother.

27:19.838 --> 27:20.971
Why?

27:22.741 --> 27:24.908
I don't know.

27:24.910 --> 27:28.412
Every time we saw them,
they'd just...

27:28.414 --> 27:31.281
Stare at us.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.516
They were lowlifes.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.251
They spent time in prison,
I think.

27:34.253 --> 27:37.688
But we didn't do <i> anything</i>
to them.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.793
The kids
who used to beat you up...

27:42.795 --> 27:44.728
Were they their children?

27:50.101 --> 27:51.635
I don't know.
Maybe some of them.

27:51.637 --> 27:52.703
Why?

27:53.772 --> 27:54.838
I don't know.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.140
It shouldn't bother me.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.842
I barely remember it.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.917
You should talk to Gabriel.

28:08.853 --> 28:12.823
If you want to know anything
about... Your past.

28:12.825 --> 28:15.659
Who knows what's in
our personnel files.

28:15.661 --> 28:18.328
He would've read it all.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.731
This may be your last chance
to talk to him.

28:25.236 --> 28:28.238
When my mom said "stuffed
peppers," I was like, "yuck!"

28:28.240 --> 28:31.175
But then I found out it was
basically a cheeseburger inside.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.576
Yeah.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.712
Well, I'm glad
you brought them over.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.180
Well, they were just sitting
in the fridge, so...

28:36.182 --> 28:38.549
Yeah, no, I mean,
I'm glad you came over, Henry.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.050
You haven't been around
that much lately.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.586
Yeah, I've been working
my butt off at school.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.055
Oh, yeah, I heard you got, uh...

28:45.057 --> 28:47.057
Bumped up to an honors class
or something.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.760
Yeah. My parents
still can't even believe it.

28:49.762 --> 28:53.197
When the school called,
they were like, "oh, wow."

28:53.199 --> 28:54.865
Henry screwed up again.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.433
"What else is new?"

28:58.369 --> 29:00.604
You were always a brainiac,
Henry.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.740
Just, nobody could tell
'cause you never did any work.

29:08.012 --> 29:09.847
Hey, you know,
Paige hasn't been around

29:09.849 --> 29:11.915
that much lately, either.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.585
You have any idea what's
going on with her and Matthew?

29:14.587 --> 29:16.954
No, I don't really talk to her
about that kind of stuff.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.856
You still have
that hot science teacher?

29:20.358 --> 29:21.925
Yeah, but I moved on from her.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.193
Another teacher?

29:24.430 --> 29:25.863
That's never gonna work out,
Henry.

29:25.865 --> 29:28.565
No, some girl
in my class... Chris.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.768
She's really cool.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.970
Wow.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.772
Your parents know about her?

29:34.774 --> 29:36.206
Nothing to know.

29:39.244 --> 29:40.811
Yet.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.474
When are you leaving?

30:10.476 --> 30:11.975
A week, at most.

30:13.411 --> 30:14.845
Are you ill?

30:14.847 --> 30:16.814
No.

30:16.816 --> 30:18.782
So, you're not keeping anything
from me?

30:18.784 --> 30:20.417
It's time for me to go.

30:29.260 --> 30:33.297
My father...
I want to ask you.

30:33.299 --> 30:38.168
My mother...
Never really talked about him,

30:38.170 --> 30:40.938
but I'm having these memories.

30:42.607 --> 30:46.043
He was quiet... very.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.045
My mother didn't talk
about him...

30:49.181 --> 30:50.214
really.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.449
She said they...

30:52.451 --> 30:56.019
Met at a movie at...

30:56.021 --> 30:58.388
A workers' club.

30:58.390 --> 31:02.292
They knew each other a month
before they got married.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.461
And she said he was a logger.

31:06.898 --> 31:08.932
And that's all I know.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.609
He used to bring things home.

31:25.416 --> 31:27.084
<i>Was</i> he a logger?

31:30.089 --> 31:32.322
He worked at a logging camp.

31:39.330 --> 31:40.898
Was he a logger?

31:40.900 --> 31:42.599
He was a guard.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.802
A guard?
Yes.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.676
What kind of camp was it?

31:52.678 --> 31:54.011
A penal camp.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.451
Why didn't you tell me?

32:01.453 --> 32:04.121
I didn't think
it was my place to tell you.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.693
Did he ever kill anyone?

32:09.695 --> 32:12.896
People who were
trying to escape?

32:12.898 --> 32:13.931
I have no idea.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.265
You saw his file.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.367
I never saw records like that.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.703
Some guards were cruel.

32:19.705 --> 32:20.971
Some were kind.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.606
I didn't know your father.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.941
Who'd he work for?

32:23.943 --> 32:25.042
Us.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.380
So that's why you came for <i> me.</i>

32:30.382 --> 32:32.215
No.

32:32.217 --> 32:34.952
We were always on the lookout
for talented people,

32:34.954 --> 32:36.586
and you were talented.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.922
The fact that you came
from a trustworthy family,

32:38.924 --> 32:40.023
that was good.

32:46.331 --> 32:49.633
Those were different times,
Philip.

32:49.635 --> 32:53.136
It's hard to explain.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.305
Who knows what your father did.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.407
He had his job.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.042
A lot of things happened.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.313
You think it was his fault?

33:13.024 --> 33:14.257
He was nobody.

33:17.428 --> 33:19.830
We were all nobodies.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.136
It's been over for a long time.

34:41.545 --> 34:43.045
You busy?

34:43.047 --> 34:44.147
Not really.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.252
They assign you that
for social studies?

34:49.254 --> 34:51.121
Pastor Tim gave it to me.

34:52.223 --> 34:53.590
Hmm.

35:03.568 --> 35:06.236
So, what do you think?

35:06.238 --> 35:09.139
I actually agree
with a lot of what he says.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.474
You do?

35:10.476 --> 35:12.309
Yeah.

35:12.311 --> 35:15.145
Except he doesn't like
religion so much.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.780
No.

35:16.782 --> 35:21.151
He says it's a drug
that keeps people in chains.

35:23.654 --> 35:26.123
What do you think about that?

35:26.125 --> 35:27.557
I'm not sure.

35:29.727 --> 35:32.963
But I know
that nothing in my life

35:32.965 --> 35:35.165
made me feel as good
as getting baptized.

35:45.276 --> 35:47.244
Did you ever read it?

35:47.246 --> 35:50.313
Yeah...
When I was growing up.

35:52.350 --> 35:56.019
What he writes about
the capitalist class structure

35:56.021 --> 36:01.791
being a kind of slavery
and how revolution is necessary

36:01.793 --> 36:03.693
to create and achieve
a workers' state

36:03.695 --> 36:05.962
so that no one is exploited...

36:05.964 --> 36:07.998
I mean...

36:08.000 --> 36:11.034
My whole country
came out of those ideas.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.705
What's it like there?

36:18.009 --> 36:20.610
Is everybody equal?

36:28.619 --> 36:30.187
We have our problems.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.625
But everybody is in it together.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.597
You haven't been there
in a long time.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.368
That's what your dad says.

36:55.246 --> 36:58.582
You should probably
keep this book on your shelf

36:58.584 --> 37:01.751
with other books
of similar topics.

37:01.753 --> 37:05.322
That way, anyone who's looking
won't pay any attention to it.

37:06.257 --> 37:08.458
I could get you a few
that would fit.

37:10.828 --> 37:13.396
Don't stay up too late.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.831
I won't.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.687
What's going on?

38:14.258 --> 38:16.793
I spoke to Gabriel
about my father.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.562
What'd he say?

38:22.900 --> 38:26.236
He was a guard...
At a prison camp.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.208
You know anything
about the camps?

38:36.113 --> 38:38.415
I know they existed.

38:41.952 --> 38:46.589
I'm not sure
why my mother didn't tell me.

38:46.591 --> 38:48.725
Maybe she didn't like
what he did.

38:54.465 --> 38:56.366
I didn't know <i> anything.</i>

38:59.203 --> 39:00.503
My own parents...

39:00.505 --> 39:02.872
I didn't know anything
about them at all.

44:16.286 --> 44:19.222
- I'm hungry.
- You're always hungry. We just ate.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.525
He has hollow legs.

44:22.527 --> 44:26.162
And a very empty head.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.697
The Americans.

44:27.699 --> 44:30.767
<i>All new Tuesdays at 10:00.

44:35.140 --> 44:38.875
<i>FX, now home

44:38.877 --> 44:40.677
I have to get away

44:40.679 --> 44:42.845
They're quasi-incestuous
megalomaniacs!

44:42.847 --> 44:44.814
How quasi?

44:44.816 --> 44:46.983
I don't know. A four?

44:46.985 --> 44:49.652
Dreamland.
<i>All new Wednesdays at 10:00.</i>

44:49.654 --> 44:51.220

right out from under your nose,

44:54.893 --> 44:56.159
and you know I can do it.

44:56.161 --> 44:58.194
Are you threatening me?

44:58.196 --> 44:59.896
Bette and Joan.

44:59.898 --> 45:01.964
