(calm music playing)

01:03.033 --> 01:03.967
Morning.

01:04.033 --> 01:05.467
Oh, here, taste this.

01:06.133 --> 01:06.934
What is it?

01:07.033 --> 01:11.200
Oh, it's my special maple syrup, honey,
brown sugar, molasses, rice Krispies log.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.567
How practical.

01:13.633 --> 01:16.266
A snack you can panel your den with.

01:17.567 --> 01:20.400
Some people put flour in it,
but I think that makes it too heavy.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.767
My kids always liked it this way.

01:24.233 --> 01:27.066
Tell me, Rose, do any of your kids
still have their own teeth?

01:28.266 --> 01:30.533
I know it's a little sweet,
but it's Kirsten's favorite.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.867
So, what are you and your daughter
planning on doing this week?

01:33.934 --> 01:36.166
Oh, my granddaughter's never been
to Florida before,

01:36.233 --> 01:39.400
so I thought I'd take them
to SeaWorld and GatorWorld

01:39.467 --> 01:41.900
and Reptile World and Parrot Village.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.834
What? The parrots don't get a world?

01:45.767 --> 01:47.533
Oh, this is outrageous!

01:48.900 --> 01:52.500
Dorothy, just look at this man.
He is obviously guilty as sin!

01:52.567 --> 01:54.333
I don't even know
why they're bothering with a trial.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.233
What trial?

01:55.300 --> 01:56.800
Oh, the Duncan Osgood trial.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.834
You know, that big society murder
over in Palm Beach?

01:58.900 --> 02:00.767
What makes you so sure he's guilty?

02:00.834 --> 02:03.767
His wife was found
at the bottom of their private lake,

02:03.834 --> 02:05.567
clutching his dickey in her hand.

02:09.066 --> 02:12.100
Well, that would certainly place him
at the scene of the crime.

02:15.066 --> 02:17.333
Look at this. I'm a walking time bomb.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.200
230 over 190.

02:19.266 --> 02:20.900
Stand back. I could blow any minute.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.500
Ma, you know that machine is not working.

02:25.567 --> 02:28.166
You shouldn't take any chances.
I can't be moved.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.934
Somebody else will have to give up
their room for Rose's family.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.266
Come on. You're fine.
You're staying with me.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.900
You always complain,
and we always get through it.

02:36.367 --> 02:38.066
All right, fine.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.233
But I'm begging you,
while we're sleeping together,

02:41.300 --> 02:43.500
please lay off the broccoli
at dinner, huh?

02:47.633 --> 02:50.934
Sophia, I really appreciate
you giving up your room.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.433
It's just so much more fun
having the family here than at a hotel.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.300
I bet you're pretty excited
about their visit.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.000
Oh, yes.

02:58.066 --> 02:59.133
And a little nervous.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.033
Nervous?

03:00.100 --> 03:03.000
Why on earth would you be nervous?
It's your daughter and your granddaughter.

03:03.066 --> 03:05.100
My friend maria is always nervous

03:05.166 --> 03:07.100
when her daughter Theresa
comes for a visit.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.400
Of course,
her daughter is a hit man for the mob.

03:10.767 --> 03:13.500
The rumor is she dated Frank Sinatra.

03:13.567 --> 03:15.266
You know the song "The lady Is A Tramp"?

03:15.333 --> 03:17.500
It used to be "Theresa Is A Tramp."

03:18.800 --> 03:21.033
Well, they had to change it
for legal reasons.

03:21.967 --> 03:23.667
Ma, what are you talking about?

03:23.734 --> 03:25.700
Somebody asked me about Frank Sinatra.

03:25.767 --> 03:29.266
We were asking Rose why she's nervous
about seeing her daughter.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.400
Then try to stay on the subject.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.700
Why are you nervous, Rose?

03:33.967 --> 03:36.867
Well, I'm nervous
'cause I made Kirsten executor of my will,

03:36.934 --> 03:38.734
and I have to go over the documents
with her.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.367
Oh, honey, she's a big girl.

03:40.433 --> 03:43.533
I mean, this may not be
the most pleasant conversation

03:43.600 --> 03:45.767
you two will ever have,
but she can handle it.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.467
Well, there are just some things in there
that might surprise her.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.533
Oh, some deep, dark family secrets?

03:51.600 --> 03:52.266
No.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.934
I just don't know how she's gonna react.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.133
Oh, boy, I'd love to put some surprises
in my will.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.834
Like leaving a small remembrance

04:00.900 --> 04:03.367
to each of the men
who has brought some special joy

04:03.433 --> 04:05.033
or pleasure to my life.

04:06.266 --> 04:09.567
Where would they read that will, Blanche,
the astrodome?

04:10.967 --> 04:12.333
(chuckles)

04:12.400 --> 04:16.166
Or maybe I'd just do something like,
"To my sister Virginia,

04:16.233 --> 04:18.233
I hereby bequeath my diamond brooch,

04:18.300 --> 04:21.333
my collection of Wedgwood China,
and all my stock in AT&amp;T."

04:21.400 --> 04:23.367
You have stock in AT&amp;T?

04:23.433 --> 04:25.734
I don't have any of those things,
but for one brief moment,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.700
Virginia would think
she'd hit the jackpot!

04:29.166 --> 04:32.166
(calm music playing)

04:35.333 --> 04:38.433
<i>♪ That's why hm-hm-hm is a tramp ♪</i>

04:40.300 --> 04:41.033
Are they here yet?

04:41.100 --> 04:41.967
No, not yet.

04:42.033 --> 04:44.600
But Rose left for the airport
over an hour ago.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.600
Wait until you see what I bought.

04:46.667 --> 04:51.300
Oh, I found the most stunning silk dress,
an incredibly revealing lace nightie,

04:51.367 --> 04:53.934
and look,
these just adorable sequined socks.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.800
(shrieks)

04:55.333 --> 04:56.967
Sequined socks.

04:57.033 --> 04:59.367
I think they kind of make
a personal statement.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.633
Yeah, "This end up."

05:02.800 --> 05:04.100
Sophia!

05:04.166 --> 05:06.934
Anyway, I'm glad I got back
before Kirsten and Charlie got here.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.967
Who's Charlie?

05:08.033 --> 05:09.100
Rose's granddaughter.

05:09.533 --> 05:12.500
That's a girl's name? Charlie?
That's a bookie's name.

05:13.233 --> 05:15.433
Honey, she's named after Rose's husband.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.967
Rose's husband was a bookie?

05:18.266 --> 05:19.533
He sold insurance.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.100
An even bigger racket.

05:24.467 --> 05:28.200
Dorothy, listen, before Rose gets here,
can I ask you something?

05:28.266 --> 05:28.934
Sure.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.567
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

05:30.633 --> 05:31.533
What is it?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.300
If you think it's none of my business,
just say,

05:33.367 --> 05:35.667
-"Blanche, it's none of your business!"
-Oh, look, Blanche,

05:35.734 --> 05:38.300
you caught me one night
sneaking out of the kitchen naked

05:38.367 --> 05:40.000
with an Oreo in my mouth.

05:40.767 --> 05:43.934
We have no secrets.
Now ask your damn question.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.333
Have you noticed
that Rose has been acting peculiar?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.934
Yes, Blanche,
from the first day I met her.

05:51.734 --> 05:54.767
No, I mean since she's been getting ready
for her daughter's visit.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.433
I think it has something to do
with her will.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.066
She's just excited
about seeing her daughter.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.000
No, I think it's more than that.

06:02.066 --> 06:05.834
You know how she said she was nervous
about showing her daughter her will?

06:05.900 --> 06:09.633
Well, Dorothy, she ought to be,
because wills make people do crazy things.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.300
Like what, Blanche?

06:11.367 --> 06:12.800
Like killing people.

06:12.867 --> 06:16.133
Do you know what they just uncovered
in the Duncan Osgood murder case?

06:16.200 --> 06:20.867
That the day before she was murdered,
Tippi Paxton-Osgood had changed her will,

06:20.934 --> 06:24.700
making Duncan the sole heir
to the Paxton napkin fortune!

06:27.133 --> 06:28.266
That man is guilty!

06:28.333 --> 06:30.834
Oh, come on!
That's circumstantial evidence!

06:30.900 --> 06:33.033
I mean, it's not enough to convict him.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.433
Well, actually, the more damning evidence

06:35.500 --> 06:38.767
was a snapshot they found
of Duncan dressed in scuba gear,

06:38.834 --> 06:41.700
dragging Tippi's body down the stairs,
wrapped in a carpet.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.100
Maybe it was from their wedding album.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.633
-(door opens)
-Here we are. This is home.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.700
Oh, Charlie, Kirsten, I want you to meet
my friends Blanche and Dorothy.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.000
Hello, Kirsten. Hiya, Charlie!

07:03.066 --> 07:05.500
Rose has told us
so much about both of you.

07:05.567 --> 07:08.033
I'm just so glad you finally got to Miami.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.900
Well, when mom told me she needed me
to review the estate papers,

07:10.967 --> 07:13.734
I figured it was a perfect excuse
to come for a visit.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.967
(chuckles)
It's just a will, Kirsten.

07:16.033 --> 07:17.767
I wouldn't call it estate papers.

07:17.834 --> 07:20.433
And while we're down here,
I'm gonna go to astronaut camp.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.266
Astronaut camp?

07:22.333 --> 07:24.567
There's a camp for astronauts?
Is it close by?

07:24.633 --> 07:25.834
Down, Blanche.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.633
It's a special program for young people.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.200
Isn't that something?
My granddaughter wants to be an astronaut.

07:32.266 --> 07:33.233
Not really, grandma.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.467
I just want to meet boys
who want to be astronauts.

07:36.767 --> 07:37.900
Me too!

07:37.967 --> 07:39.600
(giggling)

07:39.667 --> 07:43.200
Charlie, do you wanna give Blanche and
Dorothy the presents we brought for them?

07:43.266 --> 07:44.066
Sure, mom.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.200
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.033
(Kirsten) Hope you like it.
It's very popular in Minnesota.

07:49.100 --> 07:53.433
It's a maple syrup, honey,
brown sugar, molasses, rice krispie log.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.033
One for each of you.

07:56.700 --> 07:57.667
How sweet.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.834
How incredibly sweet.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.400
Oh, come on now.
We gotta get you two settled.

08:04.467 --> 08:05.934
-Can you get those, honey?
-Sure, mom.

08:07.133 --> 08:09.133
Thank you for inviting us
to stay with you.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.433
Oh, thank you for these lovely gifts.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.133
What are you gonna do with yours?

08:16.467 --> 08:18.533
It's a log. I'm going to burn it.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.867
Mom, dinner was delicious.

08:26.934 --> 08:30.066
Oh, it certainly was.
You must've spent all day in that kitchen.

08:30.133 --> 08:32.300
Oh, no. It's a simple recipe.

08:32.367 --> 08:35.100
You just take some mashed potatoes
and mixed vegetables

08:35.166 --> 08:37.300
and ground lamb
and throw 'em all together.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.967
Where we come from,
it's called Shepherd's pie.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
Where I come from, it's called garbage.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.533
Ma, please.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.333
Rose, dinner was wonderful, it truly was.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.133
Thanks.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.967
It was my husband's favorite.

08:51.367 --> 08:53.500
Charlie used to ask for it
at least once a week.

08:53.567 --> 08:57.266
You know, I don't believe George
ever requested anything special from me,

08:57.333 --> 08:58.567
at least not in the kitchen.

09:00.033 --> 09:01.967
No, that's not entirely true.

09:02.033 --> 09:03.734
Once on our anniversary...

09:04.100 --> 09:05.467
Or was it on payday?

09:06.300 --> 09:09.033
Anyway, I remember a butcher block table
was involved...

09:09.100 --> 09:09.834
Blanche.

09:11.934 --> 09:12.700
(chuckles)

09:15.333 --> 09:17.033
Oh. Anybody ready for dessert?

09:17.100 --> 09:18.767
-I am, grandma.
-Oh, good.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.767
I'll slice into that rice krispie log.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.467
(both) Uh, just coffee.

09:24.367 --> 09:26.233
-Let me help you, mom.
-Sure, sweetheart.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.800
Oh, honey,
you didn't eat your brussels sprouts.

09:28.867 --> 09:30.567
I don't like brussels sprouts.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.767
Neither do I. Put them in here with mine.

09:38.734 --> 09:40.367
Mom, your friends are lovely.

09:40.433 --> 09:42.834
Oh, they're two very special people.

09:43.233 --> 09:45.900
When you first told me you were moving in
with some other ladies,

09:45.967 --> 09:48.100
-I was really surprised.
-What do you mean?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.667
Well, I thought, "Why would anyone
who could afford to be totally independent

09:52.734 --> 09:54.133
want to live with someone else?"

09:54.200 --> 09:56.767
Kirsten, I think there's something
I should explain.

09:56.834 --> 09:59.533
You don't have to, mom.
I understand perfectly.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.900
Meeting Blanche and Dorothy
explains everything.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.867
I want you to take a look at my will.

10:04.266 --> 10:06.600
Mom, you keep your will in the cookie jar?

10:06.667 --> 10:07.467
Yes.

10:07.734 --> 10:11.367
Every time I used to walk in the kitchen,
your father was in the cookie jar.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.133
This way, he still is.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.900
I think I'd better warn you,

10:17.967 --> 10:20.166
I know how much you liked
my sapphire necklace,

10:20.233 --> 10:22.433
but I thought you'd get more use
out of the pearl earrings.

10:24.433 --> 10:27.400
Mom, these numbers don't make sense.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.133
They can't be right.

10:29.867 --> 10:30.900
They're right, Kirsten.

10:30.967 --> 10:33.200
I had them checked
with a lawyer and an accountant.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.033
But there's nothing here.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.734
Of course, there is.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.867
I mean, there's nothing close
to what should be here.

10:40.233 --> 10:44.233
Daddy was one of the most successful
insurance salesmen in his company.

10:44.667 --> 10:47.266
You couldn't possibly
have gone through everything.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.800
Well, Kirsten, times have changed.

10:49.867 --> 10:52.333
Money just doesn't go
as far as it used to.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.100
We just came to help.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.934
No, actually you were gone so long,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.834
we were afraid
you two were making another log.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.400
In 15 years, you managed to piddle away

11:04.467 --> 11:07.033
the fortune it took daddy
a lifetime to build?

11:07.734 --> 11:09.433
(Rose) Kirsten, it's not that simple.

11:09.967 --> 11:11.633
Just tell me how it happened.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.266
How could you go through
everything daddy earned?

11:16.266 --> 11:17.500
I don't know.

11:18.066 --> 11:19.767
Bad investments.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.934
I guess I got a little greedy.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.300
You know, get-rich-quick schemes.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.934
I lost it all. I'm sorry.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.266
Mother, I am so ashamed of you.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.633
I don't believe it.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.734
Well, me neither.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.133
Rose Nylund isn't the kind to squander
her money on bad investments.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.000
It's true! I did it.

11:49.133 --> 11:51.767
I guess you two don't know me as well
as you think you do.

11:52.266 --> 11:52.934
(door closes)

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
(somber music playing)

11:57.433 --> 12:00.433
(mellow music playing)

12:04.100 --> 12:07.333
(man on radio) <i>Please join us</i>
<i>when we return to the air at 6am.</i>

12:07.400 --> 12:10.633
<i>We now conclude our broadcast day</i>
<i>with the Blue Angels Squadron,</i>

12:10.700 --> 12:12.633
<i>accompanied by our national anthem.</i>

12:12.700 --> 12:15.734
("The Star-Spangled Banner" playing)

12:27.834 --> 12:29.300
-(turns off radio)
-At ease, Rose.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.166
Come on, honey,
why don't you get some sleep?

12:32.233 --> 12:33.567
I can't.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.400
You wanna talk about it?

12:35.467 --> 12:36.667
I can't do that, either.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.266
Here you are.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.500
I just spent five minutes
telling your bathroom door

12:42.567 --> 12:45.033
that everything's gonna be fine
between you and your daughter.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.066
You should never lie to anyone.

12:49.133 --> 12:51.667
Ok, it was only three minutes, but still.

12:52.934 --> 12:54.600
I stood there like a fool.

12:55.767 --> 12:58.300
Even if lying seems like a good idea
at the time.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.266
Oh, Rose. What are you talking about?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.967
Is this about Kirsten?

13:02.433 --> 13:06.400
Oh, Kirsten wouldn't lie.
I raised her better than that.

13:06.467 --> 13:09.567
I mean, except for a little white lie,
but that doesn't really count.

13:09.633 --> 13:11.066
Oh, yes, it does.

13:11.133 --> 13:14.867
A lie is a lie, which is a sin,
which sends you straight to hell.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.667
Who told a lie?

13:17.734 --> 13:19.200
Oh, who hasn't?

13:19.266 --> 13:20.700
Me. I never lie.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.233
Ma, how much did you lose
at the dog track last week?

13:24.300 --> 13:26.166
None of your business,
and that's the truth.

13:30.834 --> 13:33.333
What's the biggest lie you've ever told?

13:33.400 --> 13:34.333
(sighs)

13:34.400 --> 13:38.066
I once told my sister Charmaine that
she was left on our doorstep by gypsies.

13:39.633 --> 13:40.633
What?

13:40.700 --> 13:43.233
Well, Blanche,
why would you wanna do a thing like that?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.600
She annoyed me.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.967
Always mouthing off
about how her hair was curlier than mine,

13:52.033 --> 13:53.934
her complexion was prettier than mine.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.767
I finally said
there was good reason for it,

13:55.834 --> 13:57.100
she was left by gypsies!

13:57.166 --> 13:59.133
Had her completely convinced.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.433
(laughs)

14:00.500 --> 14:02.667
Well, what did she say
when you told her the truth?

14:02.734 --> 14:04.166
Oh, I never did.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.734
I even tried to help her find
her little old gypsy mama.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.333
Well, I lied to Stan.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.233
I used to tell him
how great he was in bed.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.800
It was really very difficult,
but fortunately,

14:22.867 --> 14:24.734
I only had to tell him on his birthday.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.800
So you see?

14:30.867 --> 14:34.166
Everybody bends the truth now and then.
It's not a crime.

14:34.233 --> 14:35.900
But I lied to Kirsten.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.500
Now she hates me for it.

14:37.567 --> 14:38.934
Then tell her the truth.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.233
I can't!

14:40.567 --> 14:42.166
If I tell her the truth about the money,

14:42.233 --> 14:44.066
then she'll find out
the truth about her father.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.233
I can't let that happen. I just can't.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.433
Ooh. My God!

14:48.500 --> 14:50.033
It's worse than I thought.

14:50.433 --> 14:53.266
Why, this is more baffling
than the Paxton-Osgood case.

14:53.734 --> 14:55.834
First, Rose had to lie about the money,

14:55.900 --> 14:58.567
and now she's hiding some deep,
dark secret about Charlie.

14:58.633 --> 15:02.400
Well, Blanche, whatever it is,
it is none of our business.

15:02.467 --> 15:03.600
Come on, Ma. Let's go to bed.

15:03.667 --> 15:07.500
No, of course it's our business!
We're friends, we're roommates.

15:07.567 --> 15:11.066
I have no secrets from you.
My whole life is an open book.

15:11.133 --> 15:13.533
Your whole life is an open blouse.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.300
(chuckles)

15:22.233 --> 15:25.233
(light music playing)

15:34.266 --> 15:35.066
(Rose) Charlie!

15:36.033 --> 15:38.166
-Charlie, lunch is ready.
-Hi.

15:38.233 --> 15:39.967
Did you and mommy make up yet?

15:40.033 --> 15:41.533
No, not yet.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.734
Oh, but we will.

15:43.467 --> 15:46.433
My, don't you look lovely!

15:46.500 --> 15:48.233
Thank you. I have a date.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.100
Oh, I see. Anybody I know?

15:50.166 --> 15:52.667
His name is Robert. He lives in a castle.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.033
A castle?

15:54.100 --> 15:56.066
Oh, that's very exciting.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.533
Would you like some help with your makeup?

15:57.600 --> 15:58.834
-Ok.
-(chuckles)

15:59.667 --> 16:01.667
You know, I used to go out with a Robert.

16:02.533 --> 16:04.734
His father owned the movie house in town.

16:05.533 --> 16:09.166
One month,
I saw the same picture 15 times.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.200
Sounds like cable.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.400
So, tell me about Robert.

16:16.000 --> 16:16.734
What's he like?

16:16.800 --> 16:17.967
He's a lot like grandpa.

16:18.033 --> 16:19.667
Really? Does he look like grandpa?

16:19.734 --> 16:21.467
No, he looks like Bruce Springsteen.

16:21.533 --> 16:24.066
Oh, well, then, how is he like grandpa?

16:24.567 --> 16:28.033
He works very, very hard,
and he's very, very rich.

16:28.667 --> 16:29.500
And what else?

16:29.967 --> 16:30.967
I don't know.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.166
That's all I've ever heard about grandpa.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.333
Oh, I see.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.367
Oh, I wish you'd known grandpa, Charlie.

16:39.934 --> 16:41.934
You'd have like him a lot.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.400
Do you think he would've liked me?

16:43.467 --> 16:45.400
Liked you? He would've adored you.

16:45.467 --> 16:48.066
Do you think that this is the right outfit
to wear to a castle?

16:48.133 --> 16:51.000
Oh, yes.
And you'll be glad of that sweater.

16:51.066 --> 16:53.166
Castles can be very drafty.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.800
Are you two coming?
The spaghetti is getting cold.

16:55.867 --> 16:59.166
We'll be there in a minute, Sophia.
We're in the middle of a makeup lesson.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.567
I hope the kid can help you.

17:00.633 --> 17:02.300
You wear more rouge than miss piggy.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.266
(laughing)

17:21.633 --> 17:22.867
That's it. I'm outta here.

17:25.066 --> 17:25.967
Ma, what's the matter?

17:26.433 --> 17:29.600
I can't sleep.
All night long, tossing and turning.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.400
I'd get more rest on Space Mountain.

17:32.967 --> 17:35.100
I'm sorry, Ma. I can't help it.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.533
Hey, I could live
with the tossing and turning.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.600
Your cold feet
are what's driving me crazy.

17:39.667 --> 17:43.467
It's like having two size-nine fudgsicles
pressed up against my butt.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.934
Ma, will you knock it off?
I have to get back to sleep.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.300
Oh, good. I'm so glad you're awake.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.667
I'm so glad you're awake.
I'm taking my bed back.

17:53.734 --> 17:55.633
Fine! Rose, get into bed.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.033
Ma, get out of here
and take your teeth with you.

17:59.133 --> 18:00.533
Don't make fun of your mother.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.900
If I didn't wake up tomorrow,
you'd never forgive yourself.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.266
I'll risk it.

18:07.900 --> 18:08.567
(door closes)

18:09.900 --> 18:12.633
Dorothy, do you feel like talking?

18:12.700 --> 18:16.633
Oh, honey, if it can wait until morning,
I'd really appreciate it.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.100
I'm exhausted.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.133
Sure. I am too.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.433
Let's just get some sleep.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.166
(sighs)

18:30.266 --> 18:32.467
Dorothy, you're sleeping with a liar.

18:33.266 --> 18:34.734
Don't worry about it, Rose.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.367
Most of the people
I've slept with were liars.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.066
Good night.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.867
Dorothy, a lie is like a snowball.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.100
You start out
with one little harmless lie,

18:48.166 --> 18:51.100
and then you have to tell another one
to cover up the first

18:51.166 --> 18:53.300
and then another and another.

18:53.834 --> 18:54.800
You know what I mean?

18:55.900 --> 18:57.233
And then, before long,

18:57.300 --> 19:01.000
you've got an entire snowman
built out of lies.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.467
Dorothy?

19:15.500 --> 19:19.000
I was gonna let Kirsten leave tomorrow
and never tell her the truth.

19:20.233 --> 19:24.734
I was willing to risk having her hate me
to protect Charlie's memory.

19:25.367 --> 19:28.433
That's Charlie, my husband,
not Charlie, my granddaughter.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.934
But you'd know that
if you were still awake.

19:33.533 --> 19:38.900
But then today, I found that the lies
I've been telling about Charlie

19:39.433 --> 19:40.867
are hurting Charlie.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.567
Husband and granddaughter, respectively.

19:45.934 --> 19:46.600
(sighs)

19:47.333 --> 19:51.467
So tomorrow, I'm just gonna have to stop
this lying and tell the truth,

19:51.533 --> 19:54.100
no matter how much
it might hurt all of us.

19:57.166 --> 20:01.734
Dorothy, I want you to know
that having friends like you

20:01.800 --> 20:04.500
really helps me get through
times like this.

20:05.700 --> 20:08.934
Now you sleep well,
and I'll see you in the morning.

20:09.767 --> 20:10.600
I love you.

20:15.967 --> 20:16.633
(sighs)

20:19.467 --> 20:21.967
Oh, thank God.
I thought you'd never shut up.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.500
(mellow music playing)

20:34.233 --> 20:34.900
(chuckles)

20:35.400 --> 20:38.233
Well, whoever said a man is innocent
until proven guilty

20:38.300 --> 20:39.767
sure said a mouthful.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.333
I was wrong about Duncan.
He didn't kill Tippi.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.100
Well, what about all that evidence?

20:44.166 --> 20:47.600
The scuba gear, the carpet, the dickey?

20:49.100 --> 20:51.033
It turns out it was one
of their trusted servants

20:51.100 --> 20:52.533
who was trying to frame poor Duncan.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.300
The butler did it?

20:54.367 --> 20:56.667
No, he just thought of it.
He made the maid do it.

20:59.567 --> 21:01.200
-Good morning.
-(both) Good morning.

21:01.266 --> 21:03.300
Oh, honey, I think your mother
was looking for you.

21:03.367 --> 21:06.200
Oh, I've been to the airline office
changing our tickets.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.467
We're leaving this afternoon.

21:08.000 --> 21:08.667
Where's Charlie?

21:08.734 --> 21:09.867
On the lanai.

21:09.934 --> 21:14.633
My mother is trying to help her put
barbie's hair back on with Poligrip.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.433
Oh, Kirsten, you're back.

21:18.867 --> 21:20.233
I wanna talk to you.

21:20.300 --> 21:21.567
Uh, not now, mother.

21:21.633 --> 21:24.266
I promised Charlie I'd take her to lunch
and then we have to pack.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.000
We're leaving early.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.633
Now. It's important.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.467
Mother, there's nothing to talk about.

21:28.533 --> 21:30.333
Oh, yes, there is.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.700
And I should've done it a long time ago.

21:34.233 --> 21:34.900
(sighs)

21:36.467 --> 21:40.333
Kirsten, your father
wasn't who you thought he was.

21:42.233 --> 21:45.533
Uh, I don't think it's necessary
for all of us to be here.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.934
You're right. Bye, Dorothy.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.667
Don't go. I want you all to hear this.

21:54.133 --> 21:55.633
I lied about the money.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.633
I didn't squander it on bad investments.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.567
I couldn't have.
He didn't leave me any to begin with.

22:02.033 --> 22:03.667
Mother, what are you telling me?

22:03.734 --> 22:07.333
Oh, your father was a wonderful man,
Kirsten.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.633
Kind and warm and caring

22:10.700 --> 22:13.400
and never willing to let a friend
or a neighbor

22:13.467 --> 22:15.667
struggle through hard times alone.

22:17.166 --> 22:21.266
But he was also the worst businessman
to ever balance a checkbook.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.900
But you always told us
how successful daddy was.

22:24.967 --> 22:27.967
He was a success as a human being.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.467
But his work took him away so much,
I was afraid you wouldn't know that.

22:33.967 --> 22:37.000
That's why I made him
into something he wasn't.

22:38.367 --> 22:41.767
I guess maybe I was afraid
you'd think he was a failure.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.066
I never thought of him as a failure.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.867
I hope I never let him feel like one.

22:49.500 --> 22:53.633
If I did, I can only pray
that he forgives me now.

22:55.133 --> 22:56.600
And that you will, too.

22:57.133 --> 22:58.667
Oh, mom.

23:00.066 --> 23:01.166
(laughs)

23:01.967 --> 23:05.000
Come on, let's go find Charlie
and take her to lunch.

23:05.066 --> 23:05.767
Sure.

23:06.567 --> 23:09.400
With the size of our estate,
I think we can afford lunch.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.934
So that's it? That's the big secret.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.166
Charlie was a nice guy.

23:16.233 --> 23:16.900
(chuckles)

23:16.967 --> 23:21.200
Oh, I'm sorry it lacked the intrigue
of the Duncan Osgood case.

23:21.266 --> 23:23.900
But isn't it amazing
how things always work out?

23:23.967 --> 23:26.567
Now Rose and her daughter
have reconciled their differences,

23:26.633 --> 23:29.500
and Duncan Osgood
can walk the streets a free man.

23:29.567 --> 23:31.667
I guess all's well that ends well.
(chuckles)

23:31.734 --> 23:33.066
That's easy for you to say.

23:33.133 --> 23:36.433
You're not at the bottom of a lake,
clutching someone's dickey.

23:37.567 --> 23:40.567
(mellow music playing)

23:45.100 --> 23:48.100
(closing theme music playing)
