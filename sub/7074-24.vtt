00:03.448 --> 00:05.348
It's hard to believe,
but finals are here.

00:05.415 --> 00:08.350
And I know that during
this stressful time,

00:08.418 --> 00:11.418
My voice blaring over a P.A.
Can't help.

00:11.486 --> 00:13.287
Which is why,
for the next three days,

00:13.356 --> 00:16.058
You'll hear nothing
but soothing sounds of nature.

00:16.126 --> 00:18.829
And to kick it off,
here's a babbling brook.

00:21.532 --> 00:24.200
Will anyone back me up
if I say this is ridiculous

00:24.268 --> 00:26.369
<i>Or is it gonna be another
avatar situation?</i>

00:29.141 --> 00:30.074
Hey!

00:30.142 --> 00:31.542
Nature sounds or not,

00:31.609 --> 00:33.577
We're not gonna have any trouble
passing our Spanish final.

00:33.644 --> 00:34.978
I've transcribed
this semester's notes

00:35.045 --> 00:36.647
From my digital recorder.

00:36.715 --> 00:38.582
You record every class?

00:38.650 --> 00:39.983
spoiler alert.

00:40.051 --> 00:42.085
- You mean "nerd alert."
- Alert nerd.

00:44.021 --> 00:46.088
We're all gonna spend
the next three days boning up.

00:46.156 --> 00:49.090
Then pass the exam
and move on to Spanish 103.

00:49.158 --> 00:50.792
That sounds
like a good ending, Annie,

00:50.859 --> 00:53.027
Except for the part
where I take Spanish 103.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.495
What do you mean?

00:54.563 --> 00:56.998
Spanish 102 fills
my language requirement.

00:57.066 --> 01:00.501
I guess I just figured
we're a Spanish study group

01:00.569 --> 01:03.271
So we'd keep
taking Spanish together.

01:03.339 --> 01:04.673
That's what I thought too.

01:04.741 --> 01:06.074
- I like Spanish.
- I'm in.

01:06.142 --> 01:07.744
- I'm on a tight,
four-year schedule

01:07.811 --> 01:08.945
To replace my bachelor's.

01:09.013 --> 01:10.748
I'm not gonna take
an extra class.

01:10.815 --> 01:12.249
Spanish has value
beyond credit.

01:12.317 --> 01:13.584
Not really.

01:13.652 --> 01:15.052
I know the family downstairs
hates me.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.554
I don't need to understand why.

01:16.622 --> 01:18.089
Okay, fine.
You want me to say it?

01:18.157 --> 01:19.324
I'll say it.

01:19.392 --> 01:21.627
I like this group
and I want it to stay together.

01:24.365 --> 01:25.565
Yeah, you be the cool guy,
Jeff.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.400

02:37.571 --> 02:40.306
Annie, I'm not big
on planning ahead,

02:40.373 --> 02:44.643
But I have one unmovable
appointment may 23, 2013.

02:44.710 --> 02:45.877
To buy a flying car?

02:45.945 --> 02:47.946
I have a table for one
at Morty's steak house

02:48.013 --> 02:50.448
Where I will celebrate
becoming a lawyer again,

02:50.516 --> 02:53.684
Which can only happen
if I take a full load.

02:53.752 --> 02:55.052
Don't.

I can maybe make it until then.

02:59.258 --> 03:01.793
But not by building
my schedule around bffs.

03:01.860 --> 03:03.561
We'll build ours around yours.

03:55.145 --> 03:56.379
Was fake, right?

03:56.447 --> 03:59.082
I prefer the term
"better than real," but yes.

03:59.149 --> 04:00.250
Two questions.

04:00.317 --> 04:01.418
Where did you get it,

04:01.486 --> 04:04.054
Could you have prevented
being caught, and how?

04:04.122 --> 04:05.222
One question.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.791
Where did you learn
to count questions

04:06.858 --> 04:08.926
And are you telling me
you need a fake degree?

04:08.994 --> 04:12.530
You know, in High School,
I was in a band.

04:12.598 --> 04:15.366

or did you just pronounce guitar

04:21.273 --> 04:23.041
Like a hillbilly?

04:23.108 --> 04:26.411
- Key-tar. It's a keyboard
you can play like a guitar.

04:26.478 --> 04:28.212
Get with the times, man.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.581
Anyway,
next thing you know, I'm 32,

04:30.649 --> 04:33.518

Okay, so we know three kinds
of verbs,

11:25.518 --> 11:27.352
Which took 40 minutes.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.720
At this rate,
if we don't sleep or pee,

11:28.788 --> 11:30.755
We can cover about 10%
of the exam.

11:30.822 --> 11:32.022
- And if it's multiple-choice,

11:32.090 --> 11:33.892
25% of our guesses
will be right.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.393
Actually, that's a lot
of right answers

11:35.460 --> 11:37.995
When you're guessing
almost everything.

11:38.062 --> 11:39.463
I don't want to sound
like a defeatist,

11:39.531 --> 11:41.198
But we're defeated.

11:41.266 --> 11:43.267
face it.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.635
Why even take the exam?

11:44.703 --> 11:47.138
We're all gonna be retaking
Spanish this fall.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.540
Hmm.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.408
What was that?

11:51.476 --> 11:53.010
- What was what?
- I don't know.

11:53.077 --> 11:55.846
I said "retake Spanish"
and everyone went "ugh,"

11:55.914 --> 11:57.781
And you went "hmm."

11:57.849 --> 11:59.950
Maybe it's one of those
recessive genes.

12:00.017 --> 12:01.217
I can also curl my tongue.
Who else?

12:01.285 --> 12:04.453
Oh.

12:04.521 --> 12:06.355
Annie ratted out Chang.

12:09.025 --> 12:10.191
What?

12:10.259 --> 12:11.793
You made this happen
because you're obsessed

12:11.860 --> 12:13.361
With all of us being together
next year.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.095
I wouldn't say I was obsessed.

12:15.163 --> 12:16.930
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

12:16.998 --> 12:22.268
I'll allow it.

12:22.336 --> 12:24.704
Did you record yesterday's
Spanish class?

12:24.771 --> 12:26.705
- I don't think so.
- Abed?

12:26.773 --> 12:28.073
You said you record
all your classes.

12:28.141 --> 12:30.909
Pierce called it
a "spoiler alert."

12:30.977 --> 12:34.079
You heard Chang tell me
he was bogus,

12:34.147 --> 12:36.749
And then dropped the dime
because you would do anything

12:36.817 --> 12:38.084
To keep this group together,

12:38.151 --> 12:42.789
<i>Because you are insecure.</i>

12:42.857 --> 12:46.293
Because you didn't get hot
until after High School.

12:46.361 --> 12:49.230
That's true.

12:49.297 --> 12:51.599
- Fine! I did it.
- For real, Annie?

12:51.666 --> 12:52.833
Oh, Annie.

12:52.901 --> 12:54.802
Someone make her a dude
so I can punch her.

12:54.870 --> 12:55.970
Go ahead and hate me!

12:56.038 --> 12:57.438
It's better than what was
going to happen.

12:57.505 --> 12:59.406
We were all gonna drift apart
and you were all too cool

12:59.474 --> 13:00.507
To do anything.

13:00.575 --> 13:01.641
Maybe not too cool,

13:01.709 --> 13:03.576
Maybe just, you know,
not psycho enough.

13:03.644 --> 13:05.010
- Yeah, a little crazy.
- You're a psycho.

13:06.246 --> 13:07.546
Now she is going to make
the Disney face.

13:07.614 --> 13:09.781
Her lip is gonna quiver
and her eyes will flutter,

13:09.848 --> 13:12.117
But they won't ever
actually close.

13:12.184 --> 13:14.018
But do not feel sorry for her.

13:14.086 --> 13:18.023
She stole a year of our lives,
and we're right to be pissed.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.058
- Oh, Annie.
- No! No.

13:21.126 --> 13:24.829
Everyone close their eyes.
Do it. Close them.

13:24.897 --> 13:26.664
Abed, close.
Oh, don't worry about me.

13:26.732 --> 13:30.668
I can only connect with people
through...Movies.

13:30.736 --> 13:32.536
She's the ark of the covenant!

13:32.604 --> 13:34.372
You guys, I'm sorry!

13:34.439 --> 13:37.107
I only did it so that we could
stay friends.

13:37.175 --> 13:39.376
Picture her as Paul Giamatti!

13:40.745 --> 13:42.680
- Aw, he--he's...

13:42.747 --> 13:44.848
Friends don't do
what you did to us.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.950
<i>Did the sisterhood
of the traveling pants</i>

13:47.018 --> 13:49.786
Poison each other's food
so they were too sick to leave?

13:49.854 --> 13:52.555
No! I've never seen it,
but I'm pretty sure

13:52.623 --> 13:54.491
They mailed each other pants!

13:54.558 --> 13:57.227
- I said I was sorry!
- Who cares if you're sorry?

13:57.295 --> 13:58.695
We're still screwed!

13:58.763 --> 14:01.765
Be sorry about this stuff
before you do it!

14:01.832 --> 14:04.734
Then don't do it!
It's called growing up!

14:04.802 --> 14:07.037
Annie, we were still gonna
see each other all the time.

14:07.104 --> 14:09.505
That's what my rehab group
used to say.

14:09.573 --> 14:11.541
The only one that keeps in touch
is the guy that sells jewelry

14:11.608 --> 14:12.675
Made out of bottle caps.

14:12.743 --> 14:14.376
I had hoped that this group
would amount

14:14.444 --> 14:18.647
To more than passing hellos
and whatever the hell this is!

14:21.217 --> 14:23.218
Nobody even think
about going after her.

14:23.286 --> 14:24.385
That's what she wants.

14:24.453 --> 14:26.588
More personal drama
so we fail the exam

14:26.655 --> 14:28.890
And stay in Spanish forever.

14:28.957 --> 14:32.093
We have to beat her.
Don't text her. Don't call her.

14:32.161 --> 14:36.665
Don't mention her.
We do not need her to study.

14:44.007 --> 14:45.240
Does anybody know how to study?

14:45.308 --> 14:47.009
- Annie usually--
- Whose side are you on?

14:53.338 --> 14:56.207
Happy finals week, Greendale!

14:56.274 --> 14:59.109
Continuing our stress-reducing
nature sounds,

14:59.177 --> 15:02.946
That's cut five
from "sounds of the Serengeti."

15:03.014 --> 15:06.782
<i>Here's a b-side from that album,
antelope slaughter at Ndutu.</i>

15:06.850 --> 15:09.685
Ah!

15:09.753 --> 15:12.955
Oh, God.
Did we miss the exam?

15:13.022 --> 15:15.623
No. It starts
in 40 minutes.

15:15.691 --> 15:18.125
Um, I can't wake up Pierce.

15:18.193 --> 15:20.026
Is this gonna take
an unexpected turn?

15:20.094 --> 15:23.029
You have to know how to do it.
Discrimination lawsuit.

15:23.097 --> 15:25.798
- Preposterous!
- Should we call Annie?

15:25.866 --> 15:27.066
Absolutely not.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.335
Keep your eyes on the prize
and let her grow up.

15:29.402 --> 15:33.373
I'll see you all at the exam.
Wait for me, Britta.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.275
I was with you in the bathroom
yesterday.

15:35.343 --> 15:36.843
You're with me everywhere.

15:36.911 --> 15:38.345
Troy, I know you could be
a plumber.

15:38.413 --> 15:40.747
I'm not gonna be, okay?

15:40.815 --> 15:43.316
I'm gonna be sophisticated
and have no job,

15:43.384 --> 15:44.784
Or a job that looks
from a distance

15:44.852 --> 15:46.720
Like I do nothing.

15:46.787 --> 15:49.656
Troy, you know what the best
part of my day is?

15:49.724 --> 15:50.790
For about 10 seconds

15:50.858 --> 15:51.991
From the time I sit down
in Spanish

15:52.059 --> 15:53.492
To the time I look
at your desk,

15:53.560 --> 15:58.263
'cause I think "maybe I'll look
and he won't be there."

16:06.272 --> 16:07.605
Between our studying
for 12 hours

16:07.673 --> 16:09.574
And Pierce being asleep
for 11 of them,

16:09.642 --> 16:11.209
I think we may actually
stand a chance.

16:11.277 --> 16:13.779
My horoscope predicted
suffering.

16:13.846 --> 16:14.980
No, no. That's good.

16:15.048 --> 16:16.548
Horoscopes are the devil
trying to trick us.

16:16.616 --> 16:18.449
Mm-hmm.
- Oh. Okay.

16:23.756 --> 16:25.356
♪ ♪

16:31.463 --> 16:35.766
- Yeah. That make you happy?
- Why aren't you at your desk?

16:35.834 --> 16:37.101
'cause I don't want to sit
near you

16:37.169 --> 16:38.135
Because you're a bad friend.

16:38.203 --> 16:39.303
Oh.

16:39.371 --> 16:41.472
He said the best
part of his day

16:41.540 --> 16:42.906
Is when he thinks I won't
be there.

16:42.974 --> 16:45.409
Abed, what a terrible thing
to say.

16:45.477 --> 16:46.577
It's from a movie.

16:46.644 --> 16:48.178
Well, then the movie it's from
is terrible.

16:51.382 --> 16:52.649
Where's Annie?

16:52.717 --> 16:53.650
Oh, I sent her a text,

16:53.718 --> 16:54.751
But she hasn't responded yet.

16:54.818 --> 16:55.852
Shirley, what did I tell you?

16:55.920 --> 16:57.854
Don't play into her ploy
for attention.

16:57.922 --> 16:59.322
Oh.

16:59.389 --> 17:00.790
What does it say?

17:00.857 --> 17:01.924
- Uh, she--she says
she's fine.

17:01.992 --> 17:03.359
And this isn't a ploy
for attention.

17:03.427 --> 17:05.094
She's sorry.
She does need to grow up.

17:05.162 --> 17:07.262
Starting by making things right
with Chang.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.098
- Oh, no.
- What?

17:09.165 --> 17:10.965
He'll kill her.

17:11.034 --> 17:13.635
<i>Senor Winger,</i>

17:17.406 --> 17:19.973
<i>Vamos, rapido!</i>

17:21.608 --> 17:25.845
Who cares about a stupid exam?
We're a study group.

17:25.913 --> 17:30.449
And Annie's our friend.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.685
Tierra del fuego.

17:32.753 --> 17:37.790
uh, I'm friends with Hannah too.

17:37.858 --> 17:39.057
The whole class is.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.894
And you can't have an exam
without a class.

17:41.961 --> 17:46.731
Right, guys?
We love Hannah! We love Hannah!

17:50.402 --> 17:56.507
Nooooooo!
Nooooooo!

17:56.575 --> 17:59.009
Oh, no!
The devil told the truth!

17:59.077 --> 18:01.645
Oh! Oh!

18:01.713 --> 18:06.550
- Nooooooo!
- Whoa. Winger, what the hell?

18:06.617 --> 18:07.951
What was that screaming?

18:08.019 --> 18:10.020
I was showing Annie the magic
of electronic sampling.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.856
- No--no--no--no--
no--no--nooooooo!

18:12.923 --> 18:14.557
We thought
you were murdering her.

18:14.625 --> 18:17.761
No. Annie getting me fired
was the best thing

18:17.828 --> 18:18.828
That ever happened to me.

18:18.896 --> 18:21.497
She's helping me replan
my life.

18:21.565 --> 18:23.533
She's got a real mind
for stuff like this.

18:23.601 --> 18:25.401
We're gonna find Ben a job
so he can stay at Greendale

18:25.469 --> 18:27.737
As a student and work
on his teaching degree.

18:27.805 --> 18:30.073
And music classes.
You know?

18:30.140 --> 18:32.575
Maybe get the band
back together, huh?

18:32.643 --> 18:37.746
Oh, listen to that.

18:37.814 --> 18:40.683
Yeah. Music lessons
would be great for you.

18:40.751 --> 18:44.020
Oh, thanks, Britta.

18:44.087 --> 18:46.688
Now go pass that test.

18:52.495 --> 18:54.562
Well, it was kind of easy,
right?

18:54.630 --> 18:56.797
Yeah, I think
I might've passed.

18:56.865 --> 18:59.600
Jeff, I can never
forgive myself for what I did.

18:59.668 --> 19:01.902
Look, I treated you
like a child

19:01.970 --> 19:04.237
For having feelings.

19:04.305 --> 19:08.508
Maybe because that's, you know,
when I stopped having them.

19:08.576 --> 19:09.977
But you shouldn't.

19:10.045 --> 19:14.449
You don't have to be a kid
to admit that you like people.

19:14.516 --> 19:17.619
And you don't have to dress
like this to grow up.

19:17.687 --> 19:19.488
You--you look
like a travel Agent.

19:19.556 --> 19:20.923
You don't like it?

19:20.991 --> 19:24.161
I was going for more
of a Professor thing.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.329
- What? Why?
- What?

19:26.397 --> 19:28.498
- Nothing.
- I think I got half of it.

19:28.566 --> 19:30.100
Which got me through the half
I didn't.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.468
<i>Uh, like the first season
of the wire.</i>

19:31.536 --> 19:36.106
- Exactly the--ah, hell,
I can't stay mad at you.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.441
- I think I nailed it.
- Oh, me too.

19:38.509 --> 19:41.945
Oh!

19:42.013 --> 19:44.015
I'm feeling pretty confident,
everybody.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.483
I think we're gonna make it.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.920
- Still, we should plan
for the worst-case scenario.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.122
'cause if we do all pass,
that means next year,

19:51.190 --> 19:52.890
We won't have a class together.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.494
So we're gonna need a backup.

19:56.562 --> 20:00.632
Anthropology? Anthropology?
Anthropology? Anthropology?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.802
Anthropology?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.003
- Anthropology.
- Anthropology.

20:04.071 --> 20:05.571
Anthropology. I want you to be
in my next film.

20:05.639 --> 20:06.639
Okay.

20:08.930 --> 20:12.599
- 68.
- 81.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.168
- Oh!
- 95.

20:15.236 --> 20:17.838
- Yeah.
- 70.

20:17.906 --> 20:21.408
85.

20:21.476 --> 20:26.814
79.
Winger, Jeff...

20:26.881 --> 20:29.683
I'm sorry, Jeff.

20:29.751 --> 20:31.018
I'm sorry
for the half-hearted mislead.

20:31.085 --> 20:32.619
80. We all pass Spanish!

20:34.655 --> 20:36.389
Not to take anything
away from anyone,

20:36.456 --> 20:38.623
But didn't the test seem
extra easy?

20:38.691 --> 20:41.559
Mm-mm.

20:45.631 --> 20:49.434
Hey, thanks...

20:49.502 --> 20:50.969
For making it easy.

20:51.037 --> 20:53.472
I was going to say
the same to you...

20:53.540 --> 20:56.009
But you were gone
before breakfast.

20:56.076 --> 21:00.147
- I'm an early riser.
- I'll say.
