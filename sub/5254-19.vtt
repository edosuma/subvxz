It's humiliating.

You're moving on,
and so is Liam,

18:54.631 --> 18:58.679
and I'm still here.

18:58.681 --> 19:03.278
Sad, lonely, homeless Karma.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.736
And I didn't want
to be her anymore.

19:06.737 --> 19:10.722
I thought that I would be Karma
who dates bi guys

19:10.724 --> 19:15.689
and has threesomes
and gets drunk at parties.

19:16.828 --> 19:19.655
You left out
"shows everyone her nipples."

19:19.657 --> 19:22.687
That part was oddly freeing.

19:22.688 --> 19:24.896
[both chuckle]

19:24.898 --> 19:26.816
Look, I know things are hard
for you right now,

19:26.818 --> 19:30.882
but I just don't understand
why you're always trying

19:30.884 --> 19:33.748
to be someone else
when...

19:33.750 --> 19:37.400
the real you
is so fantastic.

19:37.401 --> 19:41.071
Well, when you say it,
I almost believe it.

19:41.073 --> 19:44.274
Then I'll keep saying it.

19:44.275 --> 19:48.112
You're the best friend ever.

19:58.350 --> 20:00.442
(boy)
Whoa, are you seeing this?

20:00.444 --> 20:04.661
[indistinct chatter]

20:04.662 --> 20:06.666
(boy)
Yo, they're back together.

20:06.668 --> 20:08.861
[chuckles]

20:08.863 --> 20:10.931
Whoo!

20:13.892 --> 20:16.061
[tires screech, crash]

20:20.044 --> 20:21.312
Felix!

20:21.313 --> 20:24.049
I made it home.
Two minutes to spare.

20:24.051 --> 20:32.750
