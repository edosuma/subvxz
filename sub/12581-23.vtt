00:33.256 --> 00:36.521
Budding thespians of TLMS,
I give you

00:36.559 --> 00:39.790
the cast list of Oklahoma!

00:39.829 --> 00:41.353
I'm in a dance number.

00:41.397 --> 00:45.163
It will be an honor
to work with you.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.601
I think you'll find
my portrayal of Curly

00:47.637 --> 00:51.266
to be both sensitive
and gruff.

00:51.307 --> 00:53.434
Now, where are you, Curly?

00:53.476 --> 00:55.137
Ah! Hello there.

00:55.178 --> 00:58.739
Ken Hayashi?

00:58.781 --> 00:59.941
Sorry, Bobby.

00:59.983 --> 01:02.645
Kenny just has a certain
"rootin' tootin"' quality

01:02.685 --> 01:03.652
about him.

01:03.686 --> 01:04.653
His brother had it, too.

01:04.687 --> 01:05.949
Yee-haw!

01:05.989 --> 01:08.014
(chuckling):
Wonderful!

01:08.057 --> 01:12.050
Let's get a move on!

01:12.095 --> 01:14.586
I want to get to
the flea market

01:14.631 --> 01:17.156
while the tube sock
guy is still there.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.225
Oh, Hank,
jus tcut the pom-poms off

01:19.269 --> 01:20.429
and wear a pair of mine.

01:20.470 --> 01:21.698
Our boy is just
sulking in bed

01:21.738 --> 01:23.763
in his pajamas
and a cowboy hat.

01:23.806 --> 01:25.467
You know, if you ask
me, there might be

01:25.508 --> 01:29.000
a silver lining to him
not being a dancing cowboy.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.876
Hank, we both know
he is not like you,

01:30.914 --> 01:32.882
but you are still his father,

01:32.916 --> 01:35.384
so go in there
and sympathize with him.

01:35.418 --> 01:36.385
(sighing):
It's just...

01:36.419 --> 01:39.547
the tube sock always brings
that old German Shepard,

01:39.589 --> 01:40.749
and if it gets too hot,

01:40.790 --> 01:44.248
I know he's going to
have to take him home.

01:44.294 --> 01:46.125
(sighs)

01:49.232 --> 01:50.893
I just can't believe it.

01:50.934 --> 01:53.300
I thought it
was meant to be.

01:53.336 --> 01:56.897
Ah, yeah, I know.

01:56.940 --> 01:58.168
I know.
It's terrible.

01:58.207 --> 01:59.231
It's just terrible.

01:59.275 --> 02:00.242
Terrible.

02:00.276 --> 02:01.402
It's a beautiful day out there.

02:01.444 --> 02:04.607
Why don't you get dressed, uh,
throw out that hat

02:04.647 --> 02:06.615
and go hang out
with your friends?

02:06.649 --> 02:07.616
I can't.

02:07.650 --> 02:09.311
Joseph's at football practice,

02:09.352 --> 02:11.411
and Connie's
at one of her recitals.

02:11.454 --> 02:13.547
They both got things
they're good at.

02:13.590 --> 02:16.991
I always thought
performing was my thing.

02:17.026 --> 02:18.493
You've seen me fall down.

02:18.528 --> 02:21.588
I can cry on demand.

02:21.631 --> 02:24.122
(wailing melodramatically):
Why?!

02:24.167 --> 02:25.134
See?

02:25.168 --> 02:31.801
Uh... well, we just need
to find you a new thing.

02:31.841 --> 02:32.865
A cool new thing,

02:32.909 --> 02:34.877
and I know just the
place to find it.

02:34.911 --> 02:38.870
HANK:
Ah, the flea market.

02:38.915 --> 02:40.439
It's like America's garage.

02:40.483 --> 02:42.610
You know,
somewhere in all this old stuff

02:42.652 --> 02:44.643
is the new you, son.

02:44.687 --> 02:46.382
Hey, a lawnmower engine.

02:46.422 --> 02:48.481
Get a truck dolly and
an old steering wheel,

02:48.524 --> 02:50.492
and you could be
"The Go Cart Guy."

02:50.526 --> 02:55.361
Ah, come on, it's not that hot.

02:55.398 --> 02:56.524
(sighing):
Here.

02:56.566 --> 02:57.590
Why don't you take a lap?

02:57.634 --> 02:58.760
See what you come up with.

03:05.908 --> 03:07.933
Hey, what are those?

03:08.478 --> 03:10.742
Oh, those are Tarot Cards.

03:10.780 --> 03:12.475
People use them
to tell the future.

03:12.615 --> 03:15.641
They're like baseball cards
for Hobbits!

03:15.685 --> 03:16.743
I'll take 'em!

03:18.521 --> 03:21.354
Hey, Bobby,
ready to roll?

03:21.391 --> 03:22.449
Oh, so you found something.

03:22.492 --> 03:25.120
Yeah. I bought
these really cool cards.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.628
Well, all right, Bobby!

03:26.663 --> 03:29.029
Everybody respects a guy
who's good at cards.

03:29.065 --> 03:30.032
Really?

03:30.066 --> 03:31.033
Well, sure.

03:31.067 --> 03:33.900
That's why they always get
nicknames like "Amarillo Slim"

03:33.936 --> 03:36.404
or "The Cincinnati Kid."

03:36.439 --> 03:39.897
I know, I'll call you "Ace!"

03:39.942 --> 03:42.672
Now focus all your energy
on this card,

03:42.712 --> 03:44.680
and it will foretell
your future.

03:44.714 --> 03:46.306
The ten of swords...

03:46.349 --> 03:50.479
it means advantage,
profit, success.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.249
Well, hey, that's great.

03:52.288 --> 03:54.279
Things have been going
pretty well for me,

03:54.323 --> 03:59.852
you know, with my girlfriend,
Laoma, and... (chuckles).

03:59.896 --> 04:02.990
Oh, wait, it's upside down.

04:03.032 --> 04:04.897
That means something.

04:04.934 --> 04:08.700
Pain, affliction,
tears, sadness, desolation.

04:08.738 --> 04:10.569
(pathetic whining)

04:10.606 --> 04:14.372
Oh, for the love
of Mordecai.

04:14.410 --> 04:18.369
Oh, I see you're into Tarot.

04:18.414 --> 04:21.007
How long have you divined
the cards?

04:21.050 --> 04:22.210
Couple of days.

04:22.251 --> 04:24.446
It's kind of my thing.

04:24.487 --> 04:25.886
(hissing scoff)

04:25.922 --> 04:27.890
The only thing you can predict
with these

04:27.924 --> 04:28.822
is a coincidence.

04:28.858 --> 04:31.759
No. If you want
any accuracy at all,

04:31.794 --> 04:34.354
you need a Mantegna deck,
or at least a Fibbia.

04:34.397 --> 04:37.594
Huh. Sounds like you really know
what you're talking about.

04:37.633 --> 04:40.261
(sarcastically):
Yeah. Sounds like.

04:40.303 --> 04:44.706
As a 14th-level sorcerer,
I'd be a joke if I didn't.

04:44.741 --> 04:46.709
Of course,
forecasting the future

04:46.743 --> 04:48.176
is just the beginning.

04:48.211 --> 04:50.042
The real power of magick...

04:50.079 --> 04:51.478
and that's magick with a "ck"...

04:51.514 --> 04:54.312
comes in manipulating
the present.

04:54.350 --> 04:55.317
MAN (yelling):
Ward!

04:55.351 --> 04:57.546
I told you to clean
that bathroom a half hour ago.

04:57.587 --> 05:00.522
I'm right on it, chief!

05:00.556 --> 05:02.456
Hey, I want to learn

05:02.492 --> 05:04.016
more about this stuff.

05:04.060 --> 05:06.824
Listen, young friend,

05:06.863 --> 05:09.991
do not let anyone see
this address.

05:10.032 --> 05:13.001
Arrive exactly
at the stroke of four.

05:13.035 --> 05:13.967
Ward!

05:14.003 --> 05:15.197
And bring some potato chips.

05:15.238 --> 05:17.706
Today, Merlin!

05:23.546 --> 05:25.138
Damn it, Dale,
you got to stop painting

05:25.181 --> 05:27.741
your house number on my curb.

05:27.784 --> 05:30.344
Sorry, Hank, but I got
to lay low for a while.

05:30.386 --> 05:33.651
You have no idea how far
the jackals of the Franklin Mint

05:33.689 --> 05:35.748
will go to collect a debt.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.692
Is it okay if
I'm a little late for dinner?

05:37.727 --> 05:40.491
My friend Ward invited me
to a gathering.

05:40.530 --> 05:41.360
(groans)

05:41.397 --> 05:44.992
Gee, Bobby, you put me
in an awkward position.

05:45.034 --> 05:47.901
You really should be asking
your father.

05:47.937 --> 05:49.268
Well, who's this
Ward fella?

05:49.305 --> 05:50.670
I met him at the video store.

05:50.706 --> 05:52.230
He saw my card pouch,
and we got to talking.

05:52.275 --> 05:56.575
So I'm going to hang outwith
him and his friends tonight.

05:56.612 --> 05:58.079
I'm bringing the chips.

05:58.114 --> 06:00.548
Well, see, Bobby,
I knew you'd find your "thing."

06:00.583 --> 06:02.778
And doesn’t that sound like
more fun

06:02.819 --> 06:06.186
than being in a musical
about Oklahoma?

06:14.463 --> 06:18.900
Welcome to
the Coven of Artemis!

06:21.470 --> 06:25.566
Wow! Cool lair.

06:25.608 --> 06:27.576
I suppose introductions
are in order.

06:27.610 --> 06:28.508
Bobby, meet Vaughn,

06:28.544 --> 06:29.511
N'oram Woodbender,

06:29.545 --> 06:30.512
Pan the Soothsayer,

06:30.546 --> 06:33.913
and of course,
the Master of Disaster...

06:33.950 --> 06:35.417
Mitchell Jefferson.

06:35.451 --> 06:37.817
You can’t just bring outsiders
to our meetings!

06:37.854 --> 06:39.014
It's okay, Mitchell.

06:39.055 --> 06:40.352
He's cool.

06:40.389 --> 06:42.357
You're supposed to...

06:42.391 --> 06:45.053
I said, he's cool!

06:45.094 --> 06:46.061
Welcome.

06:46.095 --> 06:47.790
Bobby, be forewarned.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.798
Because of the
powers of the Coven,

06:49.832 --> 06:50.799
people fear us.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.734
When we walk down the streets,
mothers steer their babies away.

06:53.769 --> 06:56.101
Shopkeepers close their stores.

06:56.138 --> 06:57.196
Holy!

06:57.240 --> 07:00.266
This looks like something
out of Harry Potter.

07:00.309 --> 07:04.075
Dude, I just
vouched for you.

07:04.113 --> 07:07.776
If Harry Potter went to... hell.

07:07.817 --> 07:13.778
This, Bobby, is nutmeg,
and we use this spice for?

07:16.058 --> 07:19.289
Um, oh, I remember.

07:19.328 --> 07:22.593
Give me a second...

07:22.632 --> 07:23.599
invincibility.

07:23.633 --> 07:24.600
Resplendant!

07:24.634 --> 07:27.228
The spices sit easily
upon you.

07:27.270 --> 07:28.237
MAN:
Oh...

07:28.271 --> 07:30.933
I see you boys
are making a cake.

07:30.973 --> 07:31.997
A cake?!

07:32.041 --> 07:33.008
Yeah.

07:33.042 --> 07:35.806
A cake of tremendous power!

07:35.845 --> 07:37.437
(boys laughing)

07:37.480 --> 07:40.142
Score one for the acolyte.

07:40.182 --> 07:42.878
GAME ANNOUNCER:
Fumble, Joseph Gribble.

07:42.919 --> 07:46.218
As much as I hate
seeing my boy
play badly,

07:46.255 --> 07:49.554
I do enjoy hearing his name
over the loudspeaker.

07:49.592 --> 07:52.254
Sorry, but I got to blow off
the last quarter.

07:52.295 --> 07:54.957
I told the guys I'd meet them
in the parking lot.

07:54.997 --> 07:56.259
Know when to
hold 'em, Ace.

07:56.299 --> 07:57.823
Go get 'em, Shuffles!

07:57.867 --> 08:03.828
Uh-oh. Ace is
going to need this.

08:03.873 --> 08:05.841
Hey, any of you kids
seen Bobby Hill...

08:05.875 --> 08:09.003
Blonde hair,
card player...

08:09.045 --> 08:11.639
(finger cymbals chinging)

08:11.681 --> 08:13.740
That's okay, he must be
tailgating over there.

08:13.783 --> 08:18.447
Forces of fire,

08:18.487 --> 08:19.647
beings of the south,

08:19.689 --> 08:23.523
we command you to rise
and lend us your power!

08:23.559 --> 08:24.526
Interloper!

08:24.560 --> 08:26.528
What the hell
are you people doing?

08:26.562 --> 08:27.586
Hey, Dad!

08:27.630 --> 08:28.528
Bobby?

08:28.564 --> 08:29.588
Meet the guys.

08:29.632 --> 08:35.537
Or as we like to call ourselves:
The Coven of Artemis.

08:35.571 --> 08:37.061
(yells)

08:37.106 --> 08:39.404
HANK:
Here I am thinking
you're playing

08:39.442 --> 08:41.433
a nice, honest game of poker,

08:41.477 --> 08:42.943
and instead
you're summoning

08:42.979 --> 08:44.640
the Prince of Dragons?!

08:44.680 --> 08:47.240
BOY (laughing):
Hey, check out the dork!

08:47.283 --> 08:49.308
Jedi Knight, 10:00.
Hey, what's
with Yoda?

08:49.352 --> 08:50.751
BOBBY:
You can't play poker

08:50.786 --> 08:52.777
with these cards, Dad.
(scoffs)

08:52.822 --> 08:54.813
That's a good way
to bring down

08:54.857 --> 08:56.119
the wrath of Lud.

08:56.158 --> 08:58.558
It's all here
in the book I bought.

08:58.594 --> 09:00.425
Forty-five
dollars?!

09:00.463 --> 09:02.556
The family Bible
costs less that that,

09:02.598 --> 09:04.122
and it was
written by Jesus.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.930
Yeah, but this book tells you
how to summon wood nymphs

09:06.969 --> 09:08.800
and water sprites.

09:08.838 --> 09:09.805
(sighs)

09:09.839 --> 09:11.807
All right, look,
I know you're at an age

09:11.841 --> 09:13.809
where you think all this stuff
is interesting,

09:13.843 --> 09:15.276
but believe me it really isn't.

09:15.311 --> 09:17.302
But you told me to find
a new thing.

09:17.346 --> 09:18.278
And then when I do,

09:18.314 --> 09:20.407
you just want
to take it away from me.

09:20.449 --> 09:22.849
They're my circle of power.

09:22.885 --> 09:25.820
(sighing):
Believe me, Bobby,
I'm doing it for your own good.

09:25.855 --> 09:28.085
Now we're not going to tell
your mother about this.

09:28.124 --> 09:29.614
I know she shields me

09:29.658 --> 09:31.148
from a lot of
the things you do,

09:31.193 --> 09:33.286
and, well, I'm going
to return the favor

09:33.329 --> 09:35.524
on this one.

09:36.799 --> 09:42.795
Harness the energy
of the crystal.

09:45.007 --> 09:46.338
Well, done, N'oram!

09:46.375 --> 09:49.867
Your powers are
growing stronger.

09:54.183 --> 09:55.411
Hey, guys.

09:55.451 --> 09:57.351
Ah, young apprentice.

09:57.386 --> 09:59.479
Something is
on your mind.

09:59.522 --> 10:00.819
I can sense it.

10:00.856 --> 10:04.417
My dad says I can't hang out
with you guys anymore.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.792
I guess he thinks
magick is dumb.

10:06.829 --> 10:08.387
Magick is "dumb"?

10:08.431 --> 10:10.092
Does this look dumb?

10:10.132 --> 10:11.099
F'zah!

10:11.133 --> 10:13.101
COOK:
Don't make me
come over there!

10:13.135 --> 10:16.070
N'oram, are you trying
to get us kicked out of here?

10:16.105 --> 10:17.436
Sorry.

10:17.473 --> 10:20.101
Bobby, the problem
with your father is

10:20.142 --> 10:21.336
he's "ungifted."

10:21.377 --> 10:22.344
Our kind

10:22.378 --> 10:23.572
have always
been persecuted

10:23.612 --> 10:26.012
by those
who understand not.

10:26.048 --> 10:28.016
From the Salem
trials of the 1600s

10:28.050 --> 10:31.542
to the locker room beatings
and bathroom swirlies of today.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.214
'Tis all one.

10:33.255 --> 10:37.282
So that's why my dad
is so weird about this.

10:37.326 --> 10:39.419
He's threatened by my powers.

10:39.462 --> 10:40.554
Bobby,

10:40.596 --> 10:42.860
the mark of Merlin is upon you.

10:42.898 --> 10:44.866
When you have completed
your training,

10:44.900 --> 10:46.697
you will be a White Wizard!

10:46.735 --> 10:50.933
Really? Wow!
What do I have to do?

10:50.973 --> 10:52.998
When can I start?

10:53.042 --> 10:54.703
Your training
begins now.

10:54.743 --> 10:57.268
You can start by
refilling my root beer.

10:59.315 --> 11:01.681
It was wise that you came to me,

11:01.717 --> 11:04.686
but be forewarned
that I am merely the vessel

11:04.720 --> 11:06.119
through which
the powers flow.

11:06.155 --> 11:07.679
Are you going to help us

11:07.723 --> 11:09.520
get our kickball
off the roof?

11:09.558 --> 11:10.525
Silence!

11:10.559 --> 11:12.390
By the breath of Heckatees,

11:12.428 --> 11:15.056
I summon the winds of the north
to blow!

11:15.097 --> 11:17.190
Blow, I say!

11:17.233 --> 11:20.361
Bobby, a word, please.

11:20.402 --> 11:24.532
(smugly):
Resplendant!

11:24.573 --> 11:28.532
PRINCIPAL MOSS:
Before we get started,

11:28.577 --> 11:29.544
I'd like to know

11:29.578 --> 11:31.546
the proper term
for your religion.

11:31.580 --> 11:34.515
You know, what's the politically
correct term for "witch"?

11:34.550 --> 11:36.211
Hank, what is
going on here?

11:36.252 --> 11:37.219
Uh, nothing.

11:37.253 --> 11:40.347
Bobby just got a
little carried away
with this new club,

11:40.389 --> 11:42.357
but there's nothing
to worry about.

11:42.391 --> 11:43.358
He's quitting.

11:43.392 --> 11:45.417
I think everyone's
just a little uptight.

11:45.461 --> 11:48.021
Why don't I summon up
a tranquility spirit

11:48.063 --> 11:49.963
so we can all rest easy.

11:49.999 --> 11:52.365
Oh, powers
of ancient Boolardune...

11:52.401 --> 11:54.528
I can't have him praying
in my office.

11:54.570 --> 11:56.629
School board's
very clear on that.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.503
(sighing):
He's not praying.

11:58.541 --> 11:59.872
And he's stopping right now.

11:59.909 --> 12:02.139
(humming)

12:02.178 --> 12:04.703
Hank, I may be a mother,
but I am still a woman,

12:04.747 --> 12:06.840
and I know a girl repellent
when I see it.

12:06.882 --> 12:07.849
(shudders)

12:07.883 --> 12:10.147
I want grandchildren!
Will you fix this?!

12:10.186 --> 12:15.488
Uh, Mr. Rackley?

12:15.524 --> 12:17.355
Yes.

12:17.393 --> 12:19.588
Yeah, I'd like to
have a word with you

12:19.628 --> 12:20.617
about your son, Ward.

12:20.663 --> 12:23.029
You see, he and my boy,
Bobby, are playmates...

12:23.065 --> 12:26.501
Excuse me.
But I'm Ward Rackley.

12:26.535 --> 12:27.593
You're Ward Rackley?

12:27.636 --> 12:30.070
It's one
of my many monikers, yes.

12:30.105 --> 12:32.539
I'm also known
as Madelgar of the North Woods,

12:32.575 --> 12:33.803
and in certain company,

12:33.842 --> 12:36.606
Austin Osman Starklarvatard.

12:36.645 --> 12:39.079
How old are you? 30? 40?

12:39.114 --> 12:41.708
Ha! Not even close.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.741
I am 5,000.

12:43.786 --> 12:45.981
Don't you have some
friends your own age?

12:46.021 --> 12:48.353
Someone to drink with,
maybe a girlfriend?

12:48.390 --> 12:50.756
And waste my seed
on a common harlot?

12:50.793 --> 12:51.782
Not likely.

12:51.827 --> 12:53.158
When the time is right,

12:53.195 --> 12:55.163
a maiden will be
delivered up to me.

12:55.197 --> 12:57.290
Probably from the east.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.300
(sighs)

12:58.334 --> 13:00.063
Some of this
isn't your fault.

13:00.102 --> 13:02.366
I mean, a man can only
take so many wedgies

13:02.404 --> 13:04.031
before he goes to pieces.

13:04.073 --> 13:05.040
Good luck
to you, buddy.

13:05.074 --> 13:07.941
And stay away from my son,
or I'll kick your ass.

13:07.977 --> 13:12.311
You don't understand
who you threaten.

13:12.348 --> 13:13.610
I have powers.

13:13.649 --> 13:15.241
Terrible powers!

13:19.054 --> 13:20.214
Ma!

13:21.090 --> 13:22.057
(sighs)

13:22.091 --> 13:24.992
Okay, we tried it your way;
now you're doing it my way.

13:25.427 --> 13:27.054
This is a carburetor.

13:27.096 --> 13:29.462
Take it apart,
put it back together.

13:29.498 --> 13:31.090
Repeat until
you're normal.

13:31.133 --> 13:35.502
But, Dad, the Dark Arts are
nothing to be afraid of.

13:35.537 --> 13:37.664
I'm not afraid of that garbage.

13:37.706 --> 13:39.003
I'm afraid of you

13:39.041 --> 13:40.372
getting your ass
kicked every day

13:40.409 --> 13:41.341
for the rest
of your life

13:41.377 --> 13:43.470
because you
found a new way
to act like a nerd.

13:43.512 --> 13:45.776
Ward said
you wouldn't understand.

13:45.814 --> 13:47.907
Bobby, you don't
need a crystal ball

13:47.950 --> 13:49.645
to see Ward's future.

13:49.685 --> 13:52.153
He's going to live
with his mother
until she dies,

13:52.187 --> 13:54.519
and maybe for
a few weeks after.

13:54.556 --> 13:55.352
(sighs)

13:55.391 --> 13:57.086
Now, until you stop
with all this nonsense,

13:57.126 --> 13:58.923
I want you to take
your carburetor

13:58.961 --> 14:04.866
and go to your room.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.765
(sighs)

14:13.442 --> 14:14.374
BOBBY:
I know my dad

14:14.410 --> 14:16.878
must've come off
as some kind of nut job,

14:16.912 --> 14:18.402
but you've got to believe,

14:18.447 --> 14:21.348
I'm completely committed
to our power circle.

14:21.383 --> 14:23.044
Are you? I wonder.

14:23.085 --> 14:26.953
I'd think you'd be able
to control your father

14:26.989 --> 14:29.549
as effectively
as I control Mother.

14:29.591 --> 14:32.151
Nevertheless,
Bobby's daddy has shown us

14:32.194 --> 14:34.890
that persecution of our kind
is on the rise.

14:34.930 --> 14:38.024
Perhaps it's time to take
our powers to the next level.

14:38.067 --> 14:39.227
Yeah!
Approved!

14:39.268 --> 14:41.862
Tonight we are going
to kick it up a notch

14:41.904 --> 14:44.805
and summon a dread force
that will bestow upon us

14:44.840 --> 14:46.273
unequaled power!

14:46.308 --> 14:50.301
And of course we'll need someone
to be the chalice holder.

14:54.350 --> 14:55.840
I'll do it.

14:55.884 --> 14:57.351
Excellent, my young apprentice.

14:57.386 --> 15:00.287
You'll earn
that White Wizard cone yet.

15:00.322 --> 15:02.290
We will convene at
the ceremony grounds

15:02.324 --> 15:04.349
at half past the eighth hour.

15:04.393 --> 15:07.624
Assuming that fat ass
let's me leave on time.

15:07.663 --> 15:11.895
Cool. So, uh, what does
the chalice holder do, anyway?

15:11.934 --> 15:14.061
You hold the chalice
during the incantation.

15:14.103 --> 15:16.264
Then, right after
we light the candles,

15:16.305 --> 15:19.536
you drink caninus spiritus.

15:19.575 --> 15:21.338
What's caninus spiritus?

15:21.377 --> 15:22.605
Dog blood.

15:22.644 --> 15:23.668
What?!

15:23.712 --> 15:25.475
You are the chosen one, Bobby.

15:25.514 --> 15:27.004
Soon, and for all time,

15:27.049 --> 15:29.517
you will be known
throughout the land as...

15:29.551 --> 15:33.385
Robert the Dog-Quaffer.

15:40.829 --> 15:41.818
Have you, uh, checked out

15:41.864 --> 15:43.923
John Redcorn's
New Age Healing Center?

15:43.966 --> 15:44.898
You really should.

15:44.933 --> 15:45.831
On Friday nights,

15:45.868 --> 15:47.130
John Redcorn and his band,

15:47.169 --> 15:49.000
Big Mountain Fudge Cake,
will be playing.

15:49.037 --> 15:50.800
I'm John Redcorn.

15:50.839 --> 15:52.739
I told you,
no more fliers.

15:52.775 --> 15:57.439
Hey, Bobby, you like to rock.

15:57.479 --> 15:58.446
Huh?

15:58.480 --> 16:00.448
I'm just reading up
on ancient ceremonies

16:00.482 --> 16:02.450
where people had to drink
animal blood.

16:02.484 --> 16:05.851
Aah, there's got to be
a loophole somewhere.

16:05.888 --> 16:06.855
You're losing me.

16:06.889 --> 16:09.483
You can't tell anyone this.

16:09.525 --> 16:11.117
Promise me?

16:11.160 --> 16:14.095
Bobby, I give you my
oath as a New Age healer.

16:14.129 --> 16:16.996
Okay. This group of guys
I hang with,

16:17.032 --> 16:19.000
we're doing a ceremony tonight,

16:19.034 --> 16:22.492
and they want me to drink
the dog blood.

16:22.538 --> 16:23.937
Dog? Eww!

16:23.972 --> 16:25.269
That's just weird.

16:25.307 --> 16:26.467
I have to do it.

16:26.508 --> 16:27.702
I can't do theater.

16:27.743 --> 16:28.835
I can't do sports.

16:28.877 --> 16:30.845
If I can't drink
something gross,

16:30.879 --> 16:32.540
what have I got?

16:32.581 --> 16:37.712
I had a breakthrough last night
with my fruit rehydrator.

16:37.753 --> 16:40.381
Can you believe
a mere 12 hours ago,

16:40.422 --> 16:43.186
these plump, luscious grapes
were raisins?

16:43.225 --> 16:47.992
Hank, there's something
that I think you should know.

16:48.030 --> 16:52.524
Something very personal
and disturbing.

16:52.568 --> 16:55.196
Sounds like we should leave.

16:55.237 --> 16:56.534
What is it,
John Redcorn?

16:56.572 --> 16:58.540
Bobby's going to drink
dog blood.

16:58.574 --> 17:00.041
Aah! Aah! Aah!

17:00.075 --> 17:01.042
What?!

17:01.076 --> 17:03.044
It's part of some ceremony
his friends have cooked up,

17:03.078 --> 17:04.875
and it's going down tonight.

17:04.913 --> 17:06.278
No god dang way.

17:06.315 --> 17:08.749
I'm not going to let Bobby
be branded a freak

17:08.784 --> 17:10.752
for the rest of his life.

17:20.194 --> 17:21.320
Before we get started,

17:21.363 --> 17:23.762
a debt of gratitude is owed
to Brother Vaughn

17:23.799 --> 17:26.926
for procuring the offering.

17:26.969 --> 17:29.665
My mom's new boyfriend's
a veterinarian.

17:29.705 --> 17:32.503
He lets me call him Rick.

17:32.541 --> 17:34.202
(groans)

17:34.243 --> 17:35.835
Resplendent!

17:35.878 --> 17:37.903
Now, everyone,
if you would all be so good

17:37.946 --> 17:40.141
as to take your positions
on the pentagram.

17:40.182 --> 17:43.413
Uh, Ward,

17:43.452 --> 17:47.149
a pentagram has five points,
but there’s only four bases.

17:47.189 --> 17:50.317
Why do you always test me,
Mitchell?

17:50.359 --> 17:52.350
Just go stand
at shortstop.

17:58.901 --> 18:00.698
We don't have your cat.

18:00.736 --> 18:02.601
I'm looking
for my son, Bobby.

18:02.638 --> 18:03.605
Is Ward there?

18:03.639 --> 18:07.166
Well, his bicycle isn't here,
so he must be gone.

18:07.209 --> 18:08.176
Want to come in?

18:08.210 --> 18:09.177
Oh... (giggles)

18:09.211 --> 18:10.178
Whoops.

18:13.916 --> 18:17.147
WARD (chanting):
We humbly come before you

18:17.185 --> 18:19.813
to ask for your magnificent
strength and wisdom...

18:19.855 --> 18:20.822
(humming)

18:20.856 --> 18:21.823
(groans)

18:28.363 --> 18:30.331
All right, everybody,
party's over.

18:30.766 --> 18:32.028
Oh, sorry.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.763
I'm looking for
a bunch of warlocks.

18:34.803 --> 18:35.770
Warlocks?

18:35.804 --> 18:38.329
You know, nerds
in capes and stuff.

18:38.373 --> 18:39.340
Oh, yeah.

18:39.374 --> 18:41.399
We kicked them out
about an hour ago.

18:41.443 --> 18:42.967
The tall guy geeked hard.

18:43.011 --> 18:48.244
I cast a spell
on his ass with my foot.

18:48.283 --> 18:51.844
And now, in the melding
of our joint worlds,

18:51.887 --> 18:54.378
our White Wizard will
ingest the elixir...

18:54.423 --> 18:55.856
caninus spiritus.

18:55.891 --> 19:01.659
OTHERS (chanting):
White Wizard, White Wizard...

19:01.697 --> 19:04.564
White Wizard, White Wizard.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.033
Bobby, now.

19:06.068 --> 19:08.195
Do it now.

19:08.236 --> 19:09.203
Uh...

19:09.237 --> 19:11.797
I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.037
Every gifted one passes
through the bog of doubt.

19:15.077 --> 19:16.237
Now, do it!

19:16.278 --> 19:20.681
I can't.

19:20.716 --> 19:21.683
You have to.

19:21.717 --> 19:24.049
Do it now, before
the moon wanes.

19:24.086 --> 19:25.485
Yeah, ye-yes, right!

19:25.520 --> 19:26.646
Before the moon wanes.

19:26.688 --> 19:29.748
I'm sorry.
I-I just can't do it.

19:29.791 --> 19:34.592
It's gross.

19:34.630 --> 19:36.598
Then we will have
to destroy you.

19:36.632 --> 19:42.593
OTHERS (chanting):
Menta, besa, lorta, orga.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.039
Menta, besa, lorta.

20:00.522 --> 20:02.990
(laughing):
Oh, my God!

20:03.025 --> 20:05.550
My dad was right about you guys.

20:05.927 --> 20:07.895
Under these cool robes and hats,

20:07.929 --> 20:09.897
you're all just
a bunch of losers.

20:09.931 --> 20:11.694
Silence, insolent one!

20:11.733 --> 20:13.132
Accept your fate.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.135
F'zah!

20:14.169 --> 20:15.966
You guys are so nerdy,

20:16.004 --> 20:19.770
even I feel like giving you
a wedgie.

20:19.808 --> 20:22.242
I was wrong about him.

20:22.277 --> 20:27.112
He is ungifted and deserves
nothing but our censure.

20:27.149 --> 20:28.548
Thanks for the robe, fellas.

20:28.583 --> 20:29.948
Oh, there's some

20:29.985 --> 20:31.543
dragon feathers in the pocket.

20:31.586 --> 20:33.554
Help yourself.

20:35.057 --> 20:37.992
Well, I guess I was able
to make him disappear.

20:38.026 --> 20:42.520
Mitchell, how would you like
to be the chalice holder?

20:42.564 --> 20:44.088
No?

20:44.132 --> 20:45.099
Anybody?

20:45.133 --> 20:47.897
Well, no reason to waste

20:47.936 --> 20:50.131
to perfectly good
caninus spiritus.

20:50.172 --> 20:51.196
Let's find an overpass.

20:51.239 --> 20:52.297
Bobby!

20:52.340 --> 20:54.501
Hey, Dad.

20:54.543 --> 20:56.170
Are you okay?

20:56.211 --> 20:59.908
You, uh, you didn't drink
the dog blood, did you?

20:59.948 --> 21:01.506
Me? Drink dog blood?

21:01.550 --> 21:03.108
That's not my thing.

21:03.151 --> 21:04.778
Well, good for you.

21:04.820 --> 21:06.754
I mean,
to tell you the truth,

21:06.788 --> 21:09.086
those guys are
a little pathetic.

21:09.124 --> 21:12.958
Can you believe Ward was wearing
socks with his sandals?

21:12.994 --> 21:14.222
Unbelievable.

21:14.262 --> 21:18.198
I guess I still need to find
exactly what my thing is.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.791
Well, that's okay, son.

21:19.835 --> 21:21.200
You've still got time.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.796
I didn't really find football
till high school.

21:23.839 --> 21:26.069
And I was in my twenties
when I found propane.

21:26.108 --> 21:29.669
REDCORN:
What's wrong with wearing
socks with sandals?
