-* Bad boys *

00:11.100 --> 00:13.100
-* Whatcha want,
whatcha want *

00:13.133 --> 00:14.833
-* Whatcha gonna do *
-Hey! Hey! Whoa!

00:14.867 --> 00:18.400
-* When Sheriff
John Brown come for you? *
-Officer: You better stop...

00:20.767 --> 00:22.400
-* Bad boys, bad boys *

00:22.433 --> 00:24.067
-* Whatcha gonna do *

00:24.100 --> 00:26.567
-* Whatcha gonna do
when they come for you? *
-Hands behind your back!

00:26.600 --> 00:28.167
-* Bad boys, bad boys *

00:28.200 --> 00:29.300
* Whatcha gonna do *

00:29.333 --> 00:32.700

-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.533 --> 00:36.600
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.633 --> 00:39.167
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.200 --> 00:40.767
in a court of law.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.600
-Born and raised in Vegas.

00:43.633 --> 00:45.967
Only time I ever left Vegas
was in the Marine Corps.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.600
Served one tour in Iraq.

00:47.633 --> 00:49.633
How I got hired on here
is my platoon commander

00:49.667 --> 00:51.933
gave me the good advice
of joining here when I got out.

00:51.967 --> 00:53.600
He did some
Homeland Security stuff,

00:53.633 --> 00:55.767
and he said that Metro had
a great Homeland team,

00:55.800 --> 00:58.233
so that's kind of how
I got my start here.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.167
-(dispatcher speaks
indiscernibly on radio)

01:01.200 --> 01:03.900
-So, we're showing up
on a disturbance call,

01:03.933 --> 01:06.200
Apparently,
a couple of neighbors
are having a dispute.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.833
Allegedly, one of them showed up
at the neighbor's house,

01:09.867 --> 01:11.933
possibly drunk or on narcotics,

01:11.967 --> 01:15.067
and with a rock in his hand
and possibly threw it
at the door.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.067
Oh, right here.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.133
Hello.
-It's ridiculous.

01:26.167 --> 01:29.067
It's about being
a responsible neighbor.

01:29.067 --> 01:32.467
-Whose-- whose truck is it?
-It's these goddamn people.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.433
They're parking
on their landscape.

01:34.467 --> 01:37.067
I'm running over there,
saying, "You pricks."

01:37.100 --> 01:39.567
I think they're playing soccer.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.100
They got that CMU right there
in the middle of the road.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.067
It's like a goalpost
or something.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.967
-Oh, I thought it was a rock.
-No, no, no.

01:46.067 --> 01:49.067
They got one on either side,
and so... (mimics thud)

01:49.067 --> 01:52.367
I ran right over it.
It's not the first time,

01:52.400 --> 01:55.767
so I picked up the--
I picked up the CMU,

01:55.800 --> 01:59.167
I took it over there,
and I said, "Hey,
what the hell?"

01:59.200 --> 02:00.433
-Did you throw
a rock at the window?

02:00.467 --> 02:02.967
-No! And all of them are,
"We don't know nothing.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.533
"We don't know nothing.
We don't know nothing."

02:04.567 --> 02:07.267
And I said, "Okay.
(bleeps) you guys. I'm done.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.500
"I'm gonna call the police.
That's it."

02:09.533 --> 02:12.800
So, I retreated
to my property right here,

02:12.833 --> 02:14.933
put the rock back where it was.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.233
That's it.
I'm sick of this (bleeps).

02:17.267 --> 02:19.067
This is bull (bleeps).

02:19.067 --> 02:24.267
They've done this,
like, four-- seven-- six--
I don't even know-- times.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.600
-Are they doing it
intentionally, or is it just
falling out of trucks?

02:26.633 --> 02:28.800
-I don't think they're doing it
to damage anybody's vehicle,

02:28.833 --> 02:33.167
but they are definitely doing it
to be irresponsible neighbors.
-Right.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.400
Yeah.
-That's an absolute.

02:34.433 --> 02:36.133
-We can talk to them
about that and everything else,

02:36.167 --> 02:38.600
but just for your half
of it, we can give you
the event number.

02:38.633 --> 02:39.967
You can follow up
with everything else.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.533
-I would definitely
follow up on that.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.800
All of them are
inconsiderate neighbors.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.067
That's why I called LVMPD.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.233
-Thank you.
-Appreciate it.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.833
-Yeah.
-We're gonna see
their side of the story.

02:49.867 --> 02:53.067
Hello. So, can you explain to me
exactly what happened tonight?

02:53.067 --> 02:55.400
-We have a big,
loud banging on the door.

02:55.433 --> 02:58.067
We open the door,
we see a man

02:58.067 --> 02:59.867
with a huge rock

02:59.900 --> 03:02.300
with another--
with a big stick
on the other hand

03:02.333 --> 03:06.333
just saying racist,
discriminating statements,

03:06.367 --> 03:09.867
something about a stone.
I asked him to leave.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.933
He's yelling.
He's saying racist statements,

03:11.967 --> 03:14.667
being very vulgar...
-Okay.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.767
-...angry, upset
over this stone.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.800
-Okay.
-Did he say what the deal
with the stone was?

03:20.833 --> 03:24.067
-Something about the stone being
out in the middle of the road...

03:24.067 --> 03:27.633
-Okay.
-...and it could hurt
somebody, but...

03:27.667 --> 03:30.767
we-- I honestly don't know how
the stone got there, so--
-Okay.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.267
Is the truck registered to you?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.467
-Yes.
-Okay. What's up
with this windshield?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.133
There's glass
on the seat still,

03:36.167 --> 03:38.667
which would make me think
that it's recently done,

03:38.700 --> 03:39.967
so I'm wondering if he did it.

03:40.067 --> 03:42.300
When you guys got here,
the window wasn't broken, right?

03:42.333 --> 03:45.067
-No.
-No? Okay, so you parked it,

03:45.067 --> 03:46.900
all this happened,
and next thing you know,

03:46.933 --> 03:49.200
you come back outside
and the window's all messed up?

03:49.233 --> 03:51.333
-Yes.
-Okay, but you have
no evidence of it?

03:51.367 --> 03:52.933
-Well, yeah, there's the video,

03:52.967 --> 03:54.767
with the guys
from the video's inside.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.100
-There's video?
-Yeah.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.533
-Okay.
-You want me to play
the whole thing?

03:57.567 --> 04:00.533
-So this is a video
of the whole thing?
-Yeah.

04:00.567 --> 04:01.800
-(man yelling on video)
-So...

04:01.833 --> 04:04.433
-I don't give a-- who? Who?

04:04.467 --> 04:06.233
-I call the police now.
-Whose house?

04:06.267 --> 04:09.067
Yeah, call the (bleeps) police,

04:09.067 --> 04:11.933
'cause your stupid asses

04:11.967 --> 04:15.367
are running
in front of the street,
in front of this!

04:15.400 --> 04:17.833
-I'm gonna ask you
to leave, sir. Can you
please leave the property?

04:17.867 --> 04:19.967
I'm asking you nicely.
-The video's pretty clear.

04:20.067 --> 04:23.533
Can I borrow this for a minute?
We'll be back to talk
with you in a minute.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.067
Hey. Do me a favor.
Put your hands behind your back.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.100
-What's up?
-Just put your hands
behind your back, man.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.100
-What's going on?
-We'll explain in a second.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.933
-(handcuffs rattle)

04:38.800 --> 04:42.733
-What's going on?
I don't understand
what this is all about.

04:42.767 --> 04:46.167
-They have a long video,
and it shows you smashing
that windshield, man.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.933
-(scoffs) Negative.
I went to their door

04:48.967 --> 04:51.800
with their brick and said,
"Whose brick is this?"

04:51.833 --> 04:54.400
And there were a bunch
of people talking in Spanish,

04:54.433 --> 04:58.800
and I said,
"Hey, you guys left this
in front of your door,

04:58.833 --> 05:01.367
"in front of your house."
-Okay.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.867
-"Whose is this?"
And all of them were,
"Uh, duh, duh."

05:04.900 --> 05:08.667
All I got was,
"Uh, duh, I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know."

05:08.700 --> 05:11.333
And I said, "Well,
I'm calling the police then.

05:11.367 --> 05:12.867
"This is bull (bleeps).

05:12.900 --> 05:15.567
"You guys are
inconsiderate neighbors.
This is bull (bleeps)."

05:15.600 --> 05:16.967
-So, if we show you that video,

05:17.067 --> 05:18.800
it'll explain that?
-Why don't you show me
the video?

05:18.833 --> 05:21.633
I have no idea
what the hell that is all about!
-(shouting on video)

05:21.667 --> 05:24.167
-(on video)
I'm asking you nicely.
-This is in front of your house,

05:24.200 --> 05:26.067
and people are running
in front of it.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.067
Does that not matter to you?

05:28.100 --> 05:29.800
Does this not matter?

05:29.833 --> 05:33.100
-What's mattering now--
you're scaring my family.
Could you please leave?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.500
-Does this not matter?
-No, no, leave my property.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.633
-Does this not matter?
-Leave the property.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.067
Leave the property.
-That's the best you got?

05:40.067 --> 05:41.367
-Yes, that's the best I got.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.233
For your safety,
leave the property.

05:43.267 --> 05:45.467
-It's for your safety?
-Yes, sir. Leave the property.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.400
-I'm deporting every one
of you illegal immigrants.
-Leave the property, sir!

05:48.433 --> 05:51.467
-Absolutely.
-(on video) Thank you,
have a nice day, sir.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.267
-No! The police will
be back here right now

05:56.300 --> 05:58.867
to deport your (bleeps)
Mexican asses!

05:58.900 --> 06:01.100
-Sorry if you were offended.
-Just listen.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.067
-(on video) ...middle
of the (bleeps) street!

06:03.100 --> 06:05.067
-Leave the property.
-Bunch of Mexicans!

06:05.100 --> 06:07.533
-(windshield shatters)

06:07.567 --> 06:09.533
-That-- hell no.
-Okay.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.567
-Hell no! No way. Hell no.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.067
-They follow you with a camera,

06:14.100 --> 06:16.067
and then you hear
the window smash.
-I hear it!

06:16.100 --> 06:18.933
(on video)
This is in the middle
of the (bleeps) street!

06:18.967 --> 06:20.933
-Leave the property.
-Bunch of Mexicans!

06:20.967 --> 06:22.767
-(windshield shatters)

06:22.800 --> 06:26.500
-You can't
give us an explanation?
-Guys, I hear it. I hear it,

06:26.533 --> 06:30.100
and that's-- no (bleeps) way
I would ever (bleeps) do that.

06:30.133 --> 06:32.600
-You need
something better than that.
-That's all I have.

06:32.633 --> 06:35.700
I would never (bleeps) do that.
That's bull (bleeps).

06:35.733 --> 06:41.267
I would not ever do that.
That's why I called LVMPD.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.100
Period.
-They called us too, though.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.067
Let's get in the car first.
-Mister...

06:46.067 --> 06:48.667
I'd appreciate it
if you just sided with--
-Well, we can't side.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.600
-Well, that's ridiculous.
-They're not double-locked
in there, so--

06:51.633 --> 06:57.100
-I did not do anything
to anybody's vehicle, period.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.433
-So, he's being charged
with injury/tampering
with motor vehicle,

06:59.467 --> 07:01.667
and he's gonna
be booked into County.
Just hold onto this video,

07:01.700 --> 07:04.367
'cause we're definitely gonna
need this for evidence.
If he gives you

07:04.400 --> 07:07.333
any further problems,
just call us first.
All right?

07:07.367 --> 07:08.567
-All right.
-Have a good night.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.600
-You too. Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.133
-I grew up in Warrington,
England, and I've always wanted
to be a police officer.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.133
I was fortunate enough
to come to visit

07:17.167 --> 07:20.667
the United States back in 2007,
and ended up staying here.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.067
Surprisingly, I get asked
if I'm from Russia a lot.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.600
I get Australian a lot, too.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.333
Pretty much anything
other than English.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.233
I had to wait till I got
my citizenship

07:28.267 --> 07:29.900
to apply to be a police officer,

07:29.933 --> 07:32.233
and I've been doing it
for about five years now.

07:32.267 --> 07:34.067
-220, are you available
for that?

07:34.067 --> 07:35.967
-We have-- an officer is
pursuing a vehicle

07:36.067 --> 07:37.567
just a few blocks over from us.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.833
There they are.

07:40.867 --> 07:42.433
-We've just joined in pursuit.

07:42.467 --> 07:45.533
The officer believes
they may have heard

07:45.567 --> 07:47.167
a gunshot come from the vehicle,

07:47.200 --> 07:50.767
and they fled from the area
at a high rate of speed.

07:50.800 --> 07:55.733
The officer attempted
to stop them, and they've been
fleeing since then.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.867
-We suspect he may
have been involved in a shoot

07:57.900 --> 08:02.333
because they heard shots fired
out of that or some apartment.

08:02.367 --> 08:06.067
-Driver is just switching
back and forth between lanes.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.967
We're doing about
55 miles an hour right now.

08:10.067 --> 08:13.500
We're on-- back on residential
neighborhood streets,

08:13.533 --> 08:16.400
doing about
70 miles an hour now.

08:16.433 --> 08:19.067
He's getting ready
to bail, getting ready to go.
-Yeah, he's getting ready.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.800
-There he goes.
He's gonna bail in the school,
probably. Let's see.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.733
-(indistinct radio chatter)

08:29.967 --> 08:31.700
-There he goes.
-(radio chatter)

08:32.733 --> 08:33.733
-Keep going.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.267
-Go on-- go, go.
Drive through. Go after him.

08:37.300 --> 08:38.433
(indistinct)

08:39.567 --> 08:40.567
Go, go, go, go.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.433
He's over here.

08:46.467 --> 08:47.733
Over to the fence.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.900
Go around, go around.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.167
Over here.

08:59.533 --> 09:02.333
-See him?
-See if he ducked down
somewhere. There he is.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.733
-Does anybody know
where the vehicle went?
-There he is.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.333
-Get on your face!
Down now!

09:16.300 --> 09:18.100
-You go cut my radio off.

09:24.533 --> 09:26.300
-Do you have
any weapons on you?
-No, sir.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.600
-What are you running for, man?

09:30.333 --> 09:32.233
Huh?
-You want me
to be honest with you?

09:32.267 --> 09:34.267
-Yeah, I want you
to be honest, man.
-Yeah, what's wrong?

09:34.300 --> 09:36.733
-Because...
I ain't got a license...

09:36.767 --> 09:38.767
and I'm on probation.
-Sit up, man.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.933
-There's three people
in the car still.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.833
-How many total in the car?
-Four total.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.733
-Four total?
-Yeah, 'cause the driver bailed

09:45.767 --> 09:47.367
and the other three
stayed in the car.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.900
-Okay.
-What did you all do over
at the apartment complex?

09:50.933 --> 09:53.967
The officer started
chasing y'all because
y'all shot something off.

09:54.067 --> 09:55.433
So, is there a gun
in the car or what?

09:55.467 --> 09:57.500
-Did someone have
a gun in the car?

09:57.533 --> 09:59.500
-Not that I know of.
-How old are you?

09:59.533 --> 10:00.767
-Eighteen.
-You're 18.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.567
-What are you on probation for?
-Burglary.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.467
-You know you just violated
your probation, right?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.400
-What's your name again?
-Tybree.

10:06.433 --> 10:09.433
-Tybree? What are
you guys doing over
at the apartments over there?

10:10.667 --> 10:12.833
-Do you know why the officer
started chasing you?

10:14.033 --> 10:16.600
-No. I just know that--

10:16.633 --> 10:20.400
I saw the lights,
and the first thing that
went through my mind was...

10:21.767 --> 10:24.000
I was gonna go back
to jail again, so--

10:24.033 --> 10:26.533
-No driver's license is
a ticket. Now you're probably
gonna go to prison.

10:26.567 --> 10:28.300
-I wasn't-- I wasn't gonna stop,

10:28.333 --> 10:30.367
and then I just realized that...

10:30.400 --> 10:33.033
no matter what,
I was gonna go, so I just...

10:33.067 --> 10:35.033
-You just ran
'cause you didn't want
to go back to jail?

10:35.067 --> 10:38.067
-Mm-hmm.
-Anybody fire a gun off?

10:38.100 --> 10:41.333
-No, sir.
-You were just worried
about your probation?

10:41.367 --> 10:43.133
-I don't have no gun.
-Okay.

10:43.167 --> 10:45.333
Watch your arm here, okay?
I'm gonna close this.

10:48.367 --> 10:50.300
-I told him, "Stop the car.
What the hell you doing?"

10:50.333 --> 10:52.600
And he did not stop.
He was like, "Nah, man.

10:52.633 --> 10:54.400
"Man, I ain't (bleeps)
getting in trouble.

10:54.433 --> 10:55.967
"I ain't (bleeps)
getting in trouble."

10:56.000 --> 10:58.867
And then I was like, "Man,
just stop the (bleeps) car.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.333
"I ain't trying to get
in trouble or nothing."

11:01.367 --> 11:03.133
He just kept flooring it,
and I was like

11:03.167 --> 11:06.333
man, if I could've got
out the car peacefully,

11:06.367 --> 11:07.667
you know what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.567
-If I would've had the chance
to get out the car--

11:09.600 --> 11:11.467
to get out of the car
and get on my knees

11:11.500 --> 11:13.967
or follow y'all's directions,
I would,

11:14.067 --> 11:15.967
but he was going
too damn fast.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.600
-I'm gonna ask you
something very specific.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.267
-Yes, sir.
-Was there a gun in the car?

11:19.300 --> 11:20.833
-A what?
-A gun.

11:20.867 --> 11:24.300
-No, not that I know of, sir.
-So, you didn't hear
a bang or a pop?

11:24.333 --> 11:25.633
You didn't hear
anyone shoot a gun off

11:25.667 --> 11:26.900
while he was running
from the police?

11:26.933 --> 11:30.433
-No, no. Before--
before he picked me up,

11:30.467 --> 11:33.833
he said that he was gonna take--
give me a favor to--

11:33.867 --> 11:36.733
you know what I'm saying?
You know, to take me
to Walgreen's.

11:36.767 --> 11:37.967
-All right, man.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.767
-Alex?
-Yeah.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.600
-This your car, man?
-Hmm?

11:46.633 --> 11:48.067
-Is this your car?
-Yeah.

11:48.067 --> 11:50.067
-Okay.
How do you know the driver?

11:50.100 --> 11:52.467
-Huh?
-How do you know the guy
driving the car?

11:52.500 --> 11:54.967
-Who do you mean?
-The guy who was driving
the car, how do you know him?

11:55.067 --> 11:56.567
-No.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.600
-Who was it
that shot the gun off?

11:59.867 --> 12:02.433
We know the gun
was shot off, okay?

12:02.467 --> 12:04.833
Was it someone
in the back that was
shooting it off or what?

12:06.400 --> 12:08.200
-I don't know.
-You been drinking tonight, man?

12:08.233 --> 12:09.967
-No.
-Seem like you're either
drunk or high right now.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.833
-No, no, no.
-All right, man.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.067
-Who shot the gun off
in the car?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.933
-I didn't even know
there was a gun in the car.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.733
-It wasn't you.
Was it someone else in the car?

12:18.767 --> 12:22.100
-I-- I don't know. I don't--
no rounds got popped off
while we was in the car.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.767
-No rounds when you were in?
What about when you guys
were outside the car?

12:24.800 --> 12:26.833
-Man, no,
I didn't hear any shots, man.

12:26.867 --> 12:28.133
-We heard shots, man,

12:28.167 --> 12:29.567
so we know someone shot.
-You heard a shot.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.533
I didn't hear any shots.
I didn't hear nothing.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.467
-Well, I guess we'll do it
the hard way, man.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.933
We'll swab everyone's hand
to figure out who's lying, okay?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.767
This is the vehicle
that he tried to stop.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.700
Basically, driver jumped
out of the car

12:42.733 --> 12:44.667
and continued
to go southbound,

12:44.700 --> 12:47.900
and there was three--
three guys left in the car.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.933
They're all in custody right now
and under investigation.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.333
We've got
some .22 caliber shorts...

12:57.533 --> 13:01.067
and as well as
a .22 caliber Ruger.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.133
-They just found the weapon.
-Where was it?

13:03.167 --> 13:05.500
-It was in there.
Between the driver
and the passenger.

13:05.533 --> 13:07.767
-Think that was
the gun he was shooting?
-I'm gonna guess so.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.633
-What's in there?
-What is it, a .22?

13:09.667 --> 13:12.067
-A .22. I'm gonna
get it secured first,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.867
and then worry about...

13:16.533 --> 13:18.400
-All right,
it looks like this one had
one in the chamber,

13:18.433 --> 13:20.367
so someone's
been shooting a gun off.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.500
Basically, I don't think
we have enough to hold
any of the passengers.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.733
-Yeah.
-I'm guessing
what we'll probably do

13:25.767 --> 13:29.200
before we release them
is do a gunshot residue test
on their hands

13:29.233 --> 13:30.633
to figure out
who fired the gun off

13:30.667 --> 13:33.367
and then I guess we'll file
a warrant on a later date.
-Yeah.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.667
-The driver of the car
violated his probation.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.533
He's gonna go
for felony evasion right now.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.900
-The city here has changed
a lot in the past few years.

13:42.933 --> 13:46.867
It went from farm roads
and fields to strip malls.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.500
There's definitely
a lot more people building
houses everywhere,

13:49.533 --> 13:53.167
and with that comes people
committing more crimes.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.600
We're going
to a domestic disturbance.

13:56.633 --> 13:58.733
A child called,
said her parents were fighting.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.767
-What's going on, guys?
-He's got drugs in his room,
and I was trying to find 'em.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.567
-I don't have any drugs.
I don't-- I don't--

14:14.600 --> 14:16.833
I'm not doing any drugs.
-Lie.

14:16.867 --> 14:19.967
-She punched me in the face,
and she chopped my door down
with a hatchet,

14:20.067 --> 14:21.900
trying to attack me.
-Oh my god, that's such a lie.

14:21.933 --> 14:23.833
-Then she punched me
in the face many times.
Look at this.

14:23.867 --> 14:26.433
-I did hack
the door with a hatchet...
-Look at her face.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.900
-I didn't touch her.
-...that I took from
underneath his bed.

14:28.933 --> 14:31.600
I hit the door
a couple of times.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.900
Like 10 or 15 minutes before,

14:33.933 --> 14:36.267
I was standing
in his room, and he said,
"Get outta my room."

14:36.300 --> 14:38.600
I said, "I don't have to,"
and he grabbed me by the throat,

14:38.633 --> 14:40.800
threw me down,
and I punched him in the face.
That's what happened.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.333
-She came in there
with a frigging hatchet.
-Oh my god, that's such a lie.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.100
-Are you guys married?
-It was under his bed.

14:45.133 --> 14:46.600
-We're married.
-For 22 years.

14:46.633 --> 14:49.067
-Too long.
-Anita, come over here
and talk to me.

14:49.067 --> 14:51.133
-Oh my god,
he's (bleeps) lying.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.667
-Well, that may be, but--
-She should try and get out.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.467
-He's had a history
of drug abuse.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.100
He said he was going
to the shelter.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.900
I just want him to leave.
My kids want him to leave.
You can talk to my kids.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.633
-Okay.
-The hatchet was under his bed.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.733
I turned it over,
I grabbed it,

15:05.767 --> 15:08.800
and I hatched the door,
but he wasn't even in the room.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.667
If I would've went
after him with a hatchet,

15:10.700 --> 15:13.367
I would've hatched him.
I would've hatched his face.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.300
I was just mad.
I just want the drugs
out of my house.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.333
I didn't go after him
with no hatchet

15:18.367 --> 15:20.300
that I bought him
for Father's Day.
-Okay.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.500
So, you think
there's drugs in the room,

15:22.533 --> 15:25.133
you confront him about it,
you guys start arguing
back and forth.

15:26.233 --> 15:27.700
-I turned his room upside-down,

15:27.733 --> 15:30.600
'cause I was
looking for the drugs.
-Looking for 'em. Okay.

15:30.633 --> 15:32.767
-And was he
in the room at that point?
-I had the hatchet

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
for a long time.
I was just holding it.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.933
I wasn't threatening
with it or anything.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.900
I hit the door 'cause I was mad,

15:38.933 --> 15:41.533
'cause I said,
"Where are the drugs at?"

15:41.567 --> 15:45.967
"Oh, I don't have any drugs."
I know he does. Or did.

15:46.067 --> 15:48.900
Okay, and he's outside
the room at this point or--
-He grabbed me by the throat.

15:48.933 --> 15:51.267
No, we're still in the bedroom,
'cause I wouldn't get out

15:51.300 --> 15:53.067
of the room
till he (bleeps) coughed it up.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.433
Sorry about my language.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.133
Then he grabbed me by the throat
and threw me down,

15:58.167 --> 16:00.333
and I punched him in the face
while he was on top of me.

16:00.367 --> 16:01.967
That's-- that's
the honest to god truth.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.767
-Did either of you call for us?
-My daughter called.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.333
-Your daughter called.

16:06.367 --> 16:08.833
Just kinda grabbed you
with one hand and threw you
to the ground?

16:08.867 --> 16:10.667
-Ask the kids.
They saw what happened.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.733
I didn't go after him
with no hatchet.

16:12.767 --> 16:13.833
-Show me where it's at.

16:20.067 --> 16:23.533
-The kids are the ones
that came to me and said,
"What drugs is Dad taking?"

16:23.567 --> 16:25.467
-And what'd you say?
-Meth.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.733
He's gotta get out of here,
because-- not while I'm here.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.267
I can't live like this.
The kids can't--

16:29.300 --> 16:32.067
-He lives here too, right?
-Yeah, well, how is that fair
to the kids?

16:32.100 --> 16:33.133
-Yep.

16:35.967 --> 16:39.133
-Sounds like some stuff's
going on in here.

16:39.167 --> 16:41.533
-It had nothing to do
with wanting to kill him.
-Oh, I know.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.633
-I just wanted the drugs--
I want it to stop.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.900
I want it out of the house.
-Do you think grabbing a hatchet

16:45.933 --> 16:47.733
and bashing on the door
was a good decision?

16:47.767 --> 16:49.100
-I'm glad I did it.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.667
I want to get
a restraining order.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.567
-Okay. Do you know how
to go about doing that?
-Yes, I do.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.267
-Okay.
-I've had one
against him before.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.467
-Go ahead.

17:00.067 --> 17:02.300
Charles is it?
What's gonna solve this
for you guys?

17:02.333 --> 17:03.833
It's obviously an ongoing thing.

17:03.867 --> 17:06.433
-She needs help.
-I need help? Wow.

17:06.467 --> 17:08.233
-She needs a psychiatrist.
She needs therapy.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.400
She needs something.
This is-- this is ridiculous.

17:10.433 --> 17:13.067
This is uncalled for. This is--
this should never happen.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.167
-No, it shouldn't.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.333
-I didn't do anything...
to bring this on.

17:18.367 --> 17:19.467
-Stop lying.
-Anita.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.867
-I didn't.
-Oh my god, he's lying!

17:21.900 --> 17:23.967
He's a drug addict.
-Don't care what you say.

17:24.067 --> 17:26.833
-Do you--
do you have a drug problem?

17:28.067 --> 17:29.100
-No.
-Okay.

17:29.133 --> 17:31.567
-You were gonna go
to the shelter.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.433
-Well, I-- I'm a--
I'm a recovering addict.
-He wrote his daughter a letter.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.933
You wanna read that?
Would you like to read that?
-I'm a recovering addict.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.533
-No, I'll just ask him.
I'll just ask him.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.367
-He said he was clean
for four days.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.833
-That's fine.
-I was going to do that--
when we separated,

17:42.867 --> 17:44.500
that's when I had
my problems with drugs.

17:44.533 --> 17:48.133
I won't deny it.
I-- I hit my rock-bottom,
but I got up.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.133
I went to the Victory Mission.
I did the 12-step program there.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.067
I got-- I got
a certificate for that.

17:53.067 --> 17:55.167
I got a job. I got this house.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.667
I'm working now.
I've been working
for seven months.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.133
I'm trying to do right
and get better.

18:00.167 --> 18:02.467
She's accusing me of doing
all the stuff she's doing

18:02.500 --> 18:03.600
and her friends do.

18:05.233 --> 18:08.967
What'll stop this?
If she goes to N.A. or A.A.

18:09.067 --> 18:10.133
-Just hang tight.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.333
-Well, there's pipes in there.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.433
She kind of accused him
of some drug use and stuff,

18:15.467 --> 18:17.133
so obviously that lifestyle
kind of lines up.

18:17.167 --> 18:19.267
I did get the hatchet,
and the kid's account

18:19.300 --> 18:21.267
is spot-on with what
the wife had said.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.067
He grabbed he by the throat,
threw her to the ground,

18:23.100 --> 18:25.333
held her to the ground,
and she didn't plan to use it
against him.

18:25.367 --> 18:28.233
She was just mad
and took out her aggression
that way, apparently.

18:28.267 --> 18:30.367
So, he's gonna go to jail
for domestic assault. So...

18:32.200 --> 18:34.400
-You're under arrest
for a third-degree domestic
assault right now.

18:34.433 --> 18:36.700
-Is this right, man?
This ain't right.

18:36.733 --> 18:39.700
-Relax. Let go of your hands.
-How am I gonna relax?

18:39.733 --> 18:41.967
-Let go of your hands.
-What you taking me in for?

18:42.067 --> 18:43.833
-Hey. Come on.

18:43.867 --> 18:46.167
-Oh, you gonna flip out?
You gonna beat me up now?

18:46.200 --> 18:48.067
-I don't want to beat you up.
I'm trying to do this--

18:48.100 --> 18:50.500
to get these cuffs to lock
so they don't
tighten up on you,

18:50.533 --> 18:52.300
make you more comfortable, so--

18:52.333 --> 18:54.700
-No wonder why people
are shooting you guys.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.300
-Her action sounded more like--
almost self-defense, too.

18:57.333 --> 19:00.067
-She comes at me with a hatchet,
breaks my door in,

19:00.067 --> 19:01.633
and punches me in the face,
but you're taking me.

19:01.667 --> 19:04.867
Oh, yeah. You guys
are beautiful.
-Okay. All right.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.100
My car is
right over there, okay?
We're gonna walk to it.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.433
Okay?
-Can I get shoes
or shirt or nothing?

19:11.467 --> 19:13.067
You got shoes in there
that you want?

19:14.300 --> 19:16.067
-Little late now.
-All right.

19:22.167 --> 19:23.667
Go ahead
and have a seat for me.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.367
Do you have any questions for us
before we get out of here?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.900
-Did you ask the witnesses?
Did you ask my children
what happened?

19:29.933 --> 19:31.833
Did you ask them?
-Talked to one of 'em, yeah.

19:31.867 --> 19:35.200
-Did they
tell you that I hit her?
-They gave the same account.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.333
-She's got a rap sheet
thick as the Bible.

19:37.367 --> 19:39.900
-Hey, Charles.
They explain to you what
you're going to jail for?

19:39.933 --> 19:41.300
Third-degree domestic assault?

19:41.333 --> 19:44.067
You'll basically go down there
for 24 hours, cool off,

19:44.067 --> 19:46.233
but she's gonna file
for an ex parte,

19:46.267 --> 19:48.433
so if you get served,
you can't be coming
back here.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.333
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.300
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.467
Cover is code three.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.467
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.167 --> 20:06.133
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.333
-(theme music playing)
