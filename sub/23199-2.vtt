01:56.988 --> 02:00.748
- Diana, have you seen this?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

02:00.783 --> 02:03.481
I picked up a fresh copy
off the newsstand just last night.

02:03.573 --> 02:07.248
It seems to me that the tone of this article
is a little sceptical.

02:07.796 --> 02:09.080
I'm not surprised.

02:09.176 --> 02:12.721
You should've seen the reporters' faces
when they asked me about her age.

02:12.815 --> 02:17.704
I told them she was about 27:
2,527, to be exact.

02:18.586 --> 02:21.299
She doesn't look a day over 2,526.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.813
She'll be glad to hear that.

02:24.358 --> 02:25.737
I must admit, though...

02:26.031 --> 02:29.539
it's as much of a mystery to me
as it was to my father years ago.

02:31.718 --> 02:32.919
She looks the same.

02:34.144 --> 02:37.320
I was standing as close to Wonder Woman
as I am to you right now.

02:37.406 --> 02:39.987
And she looked as young
and beautiful and fascinating-

02:40.082 --> 02:41.580
He was a major then, wasn't he?

02:41.672 --> 02:43.753
Yeah, the old Army Air Corps.

02:44.934 --> 02:48.145
And I was wrapped in a cloak
and carrying a dagger for the OSS.

02:48.906 --> 02:50.025
Seems like yesterday.

02:50.119 --> 02:52.082
- Did you see this?
- Yes, thank you, Diana.

02:52.169 --> 02:55.629
Actually, I'm not sure they believe
every word you've told them, Steve.

02:55.723 --> 02:57.103
I don't care what they believe.

02:57.188 --> 02:59.768
As far as I'm concerned,
Wonder Woman's back, and...

02:59.863 --> 03:02.443
- Steve Trevor's got her?
- Don't I wish.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.102
- Let's go.
- Yup.

03:13.371 --> 03:16.416
- How was your daughter's birthday, Joe?
- Fine, thanks, Diana.

03:16.509 --> 03:19.767
She flew in from Los Angeles
and we had two dozen teenagers over.

03:19.854 --> 03:21.187
Nice of you to remember.

03:21.610 --> 03:24.322
- Bet you had a lot of fun.
- Yes, we did.

03:50.091 --> 03:52.767
Good morning, Diana, Steve, Joe.

03:52.851 --> 03:54.433
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

03:54.524 --> 03:59.496
What you are seeing is, of course,
Hitler's takeover of Austria in 1938...

03:59.625 --> 04:04.431
justified by the Nazis as an Anschluss
or political reunion of the Fatherland.

04:04.854 --> 04:07.612
Followed by Munich,
followed by World War II.

04:07.697 --> 04:11.622
This is a former high-ranking
intelligence officer, Fritz Gerlich...

04:11.754 --> 04:14.882
Who worked from within
to undermine Austria's resistance.

04:15.058 --> 04:18.269
Today, Gerlich is alive and active
in South America...

04:18.361 --> 04:20.776
specifically in the province of Cordova.

04:21.624 --> 04:23.288
Cordova? Surprising.

04:23.756 --> 04:26.599
We know of large cells
of neo-Nazis in Rio, Buenos Aires.

04:27.478 --> 04:32.284
But San Rafael, the capital of Cordova
is a dusty, isolated, little community.

04:32.371 --> 04:37.296
Exactly, Joe. Steve, you and Diana
are to fly to San Rafael...

04:37.389 --> 04:42.148
to determine why Gerlich picked
a dusty, isolated capital as a base...

04:42.241 --> 04:45.785
for what the Nazis are now calling
"Anschluss 77. "

04:46.883 --> 04:49.761
How did we find out about
Anschluss 77, sir?

04:50.480 --> 04:53.775
A high-level CIA intercept
of a message to Gerlich...

04:53.866 --> 04:56.115
just gave us the code name last night.

04:56.294 --> 04:57.542
Anschluss.

04:57.882 --> 05:00.296
A term out of the past,
a face out of the past.

05:01.394 --> 05:04.154
What do they mean now?
How dangerous are they?

05:04.824 --> 05:06.703
That's what you will find out.

05:06.704 --> 05:10.471
FLYING TO SOUTH AMERICA

05:14.034 --> 05:17.759
SAN RAFAEL
THE CAPITAL OF CORDOVA

05:56.222 --> 05:58.684
I thought Capt. Gaitan
was going to meet us here.

05:58.899 --> 06:02.074
He probably thought the plane we were on
wasn't going to make it.

06:02.244 --> 06:04.873
I had my doubts
about that too, and the bus.

06:06.427 --> 06:08.175
Why don't you relax here a second?

06:08.810 --> 06:10.642
- Keep an eye on the luggage.
- All right.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.946
I'll see if I can find us
a reception committee.

06:13.034 --> 06:14.117
Okay.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.092
Wait a minute.

07:28.392 --> 07:30.681
Wonder Woman,
what are you doing in South America?

07:30.769 --> 07:34.019
I think my reasons for being here
are pretty much the same as yours.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.809
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, except for my whole body.

07:37.775 --> 07:40.859
- I've pulled a muscle in my shoulder.
- Here. Sit down.

07:47.157 --> 07:48.189
Better?

07:51.412 --> 07:52.953
It's perfect. How'd you do that?

07:53.038 --> 07:56.204
Well, it's a principle
that's similar to acupuncture.

07:56.290 --> 07:58.034
Pressure applied to the nerve endings.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.795
I learned it centuries ago
from an old Chinese doctor.

08:01.003 --> 08:02.166
Centuries ago?

08:03.881 --> 08:05.043
He taught you well.

08:06.507 --> 08:07.670
Who were those men?

08:08.676 --> 08:12.460
Probably a couple of thugs working
for a former Gestapo agent, Fritz Gerlich.

08:12.721 --> 08:15.390
Who, by the way,
isn't supposed to know I'm even here.

08:16.683 --> 08:18.308
I'd better go see about Diana.

08:22.604 --> 08:25.890
I ask for the man,
and you bring me his credentials.

08:27.317 --> 08:30.271
Then you ask me to believe
that your men were defeated...

08:30.361 --> 08:32.153
and driven off by a young woman...

08:32.238 --> 08:35.155
wearing what are obviously
the colors of the American flag.

08:35.491 --> 08:37.317
Sorry, sir, but I do.

08:38.034 --> 08:41.948
She has an amazing,
almost superhuman strength.

08:42.038 --> 08:45.536
Oddly enough, your description
sounds somehow familiar.

08:46.667 --> 08:50.249
There was such an American
intelligence agent used against us.

08:52.089 --> 08:54.081
But it's been 40 years.

08:54.507 --> 08:55.918
I beg your pardon, sir.

08:56.592 --> 08:59.048
Never mind. In any case...

08:59.261 --> 09:02.712
it's now more essential than ever
that I obtain complete information.

09:03.556 --> 09:06.510
The woman he works with
obviously has his trust...

09:06.600 --> 09:08.427
and is an important American agent.

09:08.936 --> 09:12.387
Do you think you can take her
without suffering further injury?

09:13.065 --> 09:14.179
Certainly, sir.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.067
SAN RAFAEL
POLICE HEADQUARTERS

09:16.115 --> 09:19.069
And I assure you, Mr. Trevor, that no one...

09:19.403 --> 09:23.151
absolutely no one except
the Ministry of the Interior and myself...

09:23.657 --> 09:25.199
were aware of your arrival.

09:25.826 --> 09:29.111
Perhaps these men were bandits
out to rob you.

09:30.705 --> 09:33.539
I doubt it. But never mind that now.

09:34.124 --> 09:37.409
I'm sorry to mention it, Captain,
but there is another possibility.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.451
A leak? In the Ministry itself?

09:42.798 --> 09:44.458
Well, I'll check into it.

09:49.178 --> 09:50.838
Have you ever seen this man?

09:51.055 --> 09:53.628
It depends upon
when the photo was taken.

09:54.308 --> 09:57.843
He'd be older.
That photo was taken before World War II.

09:57.936 --> 10:01.103
Then it is an old picture
of a man I have seen.

10:01.772 --> 10:03.053
The scar is the same.

10:03.774 --> 10:05.184
I don't know his name...

10:05.275 --> 10:08.193
but I have seen him rather frequently
in the last few months.

10:08.279 --> 10:11.113
It's very important that we find him
as soon as possible.

10:12.406 --> 10:14.066
He drives a white van.

10:14.408 --> 10:18.073
And on two occasions, I've seen it
parked outside Dr. Stern's house.

10:18.162 --> 10:21.162
- Dr. Stern?
- Yes, he lives just outside of town...

10:21.331 --> 10:25.494
but he's had a clinic here in San Rafael
for over 20 years that I know.

10:26.085 --> 10:28.160
Since sometime after the war?

10:28.712 --> 10:33.420
Yes. Amazing how popular
certain of our countries became...

10:33.967 --> 10:35.129
after the war.

10:36.042 --> 10:38.889
LATER

11:10.539 --> 11:11.915
Looks like no one's here.

11:13.459 --> 11:15.949
- We may be too late.
- Let's check around the back.

11:34.644 --> 11:36.601
- After you.
- Get in.

11:52.576 --> 11:53.690
It's ice-cold.

12:18.013 --> 12:19.294
Dr. Stern.

12:19.390 --> 12:23.339
It's strange. It seems like someone knew
we were coming to this house. But how?

12:26.313 --> 12:28.637
Diana, you read a little German, don't you?

12:28.731 --> 12:30.474
- Yes.
- What do you make of this?

12:37.780 --> 12:39.607
This is a German medical treatise.

12:42.368 --> 12:45.155
Something about cellular mutation.

12:46.037 --> 12:47.117
Mutation?

12:47.789 --> 12:52.249
I may have mistranslated the words
to mean "repetition. "

12:52.752 --> 12:54.032
Cellular repetition.

12:58.548 --> 13:01.335
Steve, I think we should find out
more about Dr. Stern.

13:01.801 --> 13:02.916
Like what exactly?

13:03.303 --> 13:06.219
Like how much
or how little experimenting he's done...

13:06.305 --> 13:09.507
on cellular repetition.
Which is another word for cloning.

13:10.183 --> 13:13.433
You mean the creating
of an identical new cell from a living cell?

13:13.519 --> 13:14.634
Yes.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.554
Like a lizard being able to grow a new tail.

13:19.941 --> 13:23.606
I think we should find out
whether this lizard lost his tail...

13:24.571 --> 13:26.230
or grew it back.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.235
Let's see what else we can find out.

13:32.035 --> 13:34.360
They also knew
we were coming to San Rafael.

14:15.656 --> 14:16.853
Diana?

15:04.447 --> 15:05.857
Now you get Herr Gerlich.

15:06.699 --> 15:08.074
Fritz Gerlich, I imagine?

15:08.534 --> 15:12.862
We ask the questions.
You are the one who's handcuffed.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.584
Get back to town.
And remember, at 2:00...

15:18.667 --> 15:22.202
you must be at the airport
to pick up HerrStrasser and Herr Rogel.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.375
Yes, sir.

15:42.772 --> 15:45.606
Now, we shall wait for Herr Gerlich.

15:53.781 --> 15:56.236
So, Miss Prince...

15:57.158 --> 16:01.487
you and I both know that the value
of our work lies in acquiring information.

16:02.247 --> 16:04.535
And acquiring it while it is still useful.

16:07.585 --> 16:08.782
My leg.

16:15.925 --> 16:17.419
Quite sound, now.

16:18.219 --> 16:19.381
Quite remarkable.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.595
What you would call a miracle.

16:22.555 --> 16:27.216
Well, precisely what is the purpose
of your mission here in San Rafael?

16:28.728 --> 16:30.352
Who led you to Dr. Stern?

16:31.438 --> 16:34.225
I've heard a remarkable story
about a young woman...

16:34.315 --> 16:37.933
who seems to be able
to toss grown men about like toys.

16:38.652 --> 16:41.487
Just what is her function
in American intelligence?

16:42.489 --> 16:45.822
As I indicated, I have very little time.
Hans.

16:47.785 --> 16:49.030
Tie her to the beam.

16:52.915 --> 16:55.240
This is a two-minute fuse.

16:56.418 --> 16:59.418
If you decide to cooperate, call out.

16:59.962 --> 17:02.453
We shall return and extinguish the fuse.

17:02.547 --> 17:04.920
If you do not, auf Wiedersehen.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.347
Pretty girl.

18:30.456 --> 18:33.243
She realized that
if she told me what I wanted to know...

18:33.333 --> 18:36.499
I would still have to dispose of her.
Good agent.

19:55.571 --> 19:58.239
He claims to know very little
about his employers.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.697
Where was he going now?

20:05.370 --> 20:08.454
He was only told to go to the airport.
He would be met there.

20:08.998 --> 20:10.907
- He's lying.
- Yes, certainly.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.499
He knows where they took Diana. Ask him.

20:17.131 --> 20:18.375
He says, "What girl?"

20:19.382 --> 20:21.873
Apparently, he doesn't realize yet...

20:21.968 --> 20:24.921
how important it is to me to find this girl.

20:25.596 --> 20:27.719
We may have to refresh his memory.

22:20.110 --> 22:22.601
Don't worry.

22:23.655 --> 22:25.398
I'm sorry, I'm deeply sorry.

22:28.242 --> 22:30.364
To be all alone like that, sealed off.

22:31.745 --> 22:35.279
Maybe she's trapped. We need some men.
We've got to try and find her.

22:46.007 --> 22:48.414
You're all right. You're alive.

22:50.720 --> 22:51.799
She's okay.

22:52.971 --> 22:56.056
I don't want to talk in front of Gaitan.
Here, please sit down.

22:57.517 --> 22:59.675
How did you manage
to get out of that cave?

22:59.769 --> 23:02.888
- I got out just before the blast went off.
- Thank God.

23:03.605 --> 23:04.981
- Was it Gerlich?
- Yes.

23:05.690 --> 23:08.312
I was near the mouth of the cave
when it happened.

23:09.110 --> 23:12.395
And I followed Gerlich
and the others to a helicopter.

23:13.447 --> 23:16.697
It took me a while to get back,
but I guess I was lucky.

23:17.159 --> 23:18.902
You were lucky for the both of us.

23:22.622 --> 23:25.658
Did you get any idea
of where they were going?

23:25.916 --> 23:28.406
Yes, a place called Campo Grande.

23:28.585 --> 23:31.870
They weren't careful in what they said
because they didn't think...

23:31.963 --> 23:34.002
- I'd be around to repeat it.
- Of course not.

23:34.090 --> 23:38.752
Steve, in the old newsreels we saw,
Gerlich had just one leg, right?

23:39.219 --> 23:41.627
- Right.
- Well, now he has two.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.296
Two perfectly good legs to stand on.

24:01.447 --> 24:03.404
- Carl Strasser?
- That is correct.

24:04.491 --> 24:07.740
- Born?
-16 March, '47, at Stuttgart.

24:08.828 --> 24:11.069
Your father's SS file number?

24:11.163 --> 24:13.570
417577.

24:16.334 --> 24:18.540
- Johann Rogel?
- That's right.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.086
Your father was
SS Gruppenführer Heinz Rogel...

24:22.172 --> 24:23.251
No, sir.

24:23.966 --> 24:26.670
...file 213994? Right?

24:26.759 --> 24:27.839
No, sir.

24:28.303 --> 24:32.631
My father was
SS Sturmbahnführer Dr. Albert Rogel...

24:32.848 --> 24:35.304
Waffen SS
Medical Experimentation Division.

24:39.687 --> 24:40.849
Welcome to Cordova.

25:06.335 --> 25:07.995
Dr. von Klemper.

25:09.463 --> 25:10.542
Herr Doctor.

25:13.883 --> 25:16.718
The sons of my old comrades.

25:17.261 --> 25:19.420
Karl. Johann.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.338
I understood there had been a delay?

25:22.641 --> 25:25.427
The van that we planned
to bring them here in was taken.

25:25.685 --> 25:27.095
But another way was found.

25:27.979 --> 25:29.223
However, gentlemen...

25:29.981 --> 25:33.563
I must stress the fact
that we must move swiftly.

25:34.234 --> 25:37.401
Yes, Fritz, but we have waited this long.

25:37.486 --> 25:39.479
You have endured so much.

25:40.406 --> 25:43.691
We will not be diverted now.
Come, gentlemen.

25:44.951 --> 25:46.150
This is the day...

25:47.787 --> 25:49.862
the 39th anniversary...

25:50.706 --> 25:53.660
of Der Führer's Austrian Anschluss.
Der Tag!

25:54.168 --> 25:56.837
And you have come
in time to share the glory.

25:57.629 --> 26:01.626
Do you remember the project I was
working on with your fathers in 1945?

26:01.925 --> 26:03.122
Yes, of course.

26:03.509 --> 26:07.552
The acceleration of the healing process
through cellular re-genesis.

26:07.637 --> 26:10.674
Yes. The more quickly to return
our wounded to the front.

26:10.974 --> 26:12.717
Yes, since that primitive time...

26:13.142 --> 26:15.847
I have achieved the ultimate.

26:16.394 --> 26:20.522
The infinite duplication
of a single living cell.

26:21.024 --> 26:23.016
The process called cloning, of course.

26:23.401 --> 26:27.314
But, Doctor, last year, research scientists
in America and Europe...

26:27.404 --> 26:29.562
succeeded in doing the very same thing.

26:30.407 --> 26:33.277
But they are light-years behind
what I have accomplished.

26:35.662 --> 26:38.947
When Fritz first came to me,
he had but one leg.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.785
But this is the greatest
scientific breakthrough of the century.

26:43.877 --> 26:48.040
No, just a prelude to the greatest,
which you are about to witness.

26:48.589 --> 26:51.127
Comrades, just before you arrived...

26:51.425 --> 26:54.378
I prepared for cloning living cells...

26:55.095 --> 26:57.763
from the sacred body of Der Führer...

26:59.849 --> 27:02.635
preserved all these years for this very day.

27:03.644 --> 27:05.387
Comrades, come here.

27:10.650 --> 27:13.852
This great moment shall live forever...

27:14.903 --> 27:16.101
in our history.

28:50.484 --> 28:51.564
Heil Hitler!

29:03.579 --> 29:06.152
Steve, Gerlich seemed to have no idea
why we're here...

29:06.247 --> 29:08.287
or exactly how we learned about Dr. Stern.

29:09.501 --> 29:12.170
Yep. Could be Gaitan is not our man.

29:12.503 --> 29:15.290
Could be. To the right.

30:04.298 --> 30:05.756
Concrete bunkers.

30:17.058 --> 30:18.303
A tank.

30:33.989 --> 30:35.567
And an armored car, too.

30:51.296 --> 30:54.794
A firing range with Brown Shirts?
That accounts for the rifle shots.

30:55.758 --> 31:00.300
Well, Steve, now I know for sure
what they meant by Anschluss 77.

31:04.807 --> 31:06.266
Diana, you take the jeep.

31:06.351 --> 31:09.719
Find the nearest telephone and call Gaitan.
Tell him what's going on.

31:09.812 --> 31:12.931
Tell him to get some men and equipment
here as soon as possible.

31:13.023 --> 31:15.809
All right. Be careful, Steve.

31:16.734 --> 31:19.485
As soon as I call Gaitan, I'll be back.

31:20.154 --> 31:21.233
I'll be here.

33:44.735 --> 33:45.980
National Police.

33:46.069 --> 33:48.525
Captain Gaitan. This is Diana Prince.

33:48.614 --> 33:49.858
Yes, Miss Prince.

33:49.948 --> 33:52.190
Steve and I have just verified
the existence...

33:52.284 --> 33:55.070
of a large Nazi installation
near Campo Grande.

33:55.202 --> 33:57.029
You'll need a heavy weapons force.

33:57.288 --> 34:00.822
They have about 50 men assembled
with tank and helicopter capability.

34:00.958 --> 34:04.575
I'll get authorization
from the Provincial Governor's office.

34:04.669 --> 34:06.958
Steve and I will maintain surveillance
until then.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.244
One last thing, Miss Prince.

34:08.339 --> 34:11.375
I was wrong about someone
in the Ministry of the Interior.

34:11.466 --> 34:15.795
I ordered a search of the apartment
of my most loyal officer.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.592
The leak has been stopped.

34:57.798 --> 34:59.422
What are you doing in here?

34:59.507 --> 35:02.080
I took the wrong off-ramp.

35:04.940 --> 35:10.875
EN CAMINO A LA BASE SECRETA NAZI

37:12.413 --> 37:13.693
Captain Hauptmann.

37:18.292 --> 37:21.329
All personnel report
to the main staging area.

38:00.328 --> 38:01.407
Achtung!

38:46.368 --> 38:48.940
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

38:51.955 --> 38:53.366
Heil Hitler?

39:03.048 --> 39:04.791
More than 47 years ago...

39:06.634 --> 39:08.960
I stood in a small Munich beer hall...

39:10.388 --> 39:13.057
and spoke to
a small band of loyal followers.

39:14.141 --> 39:17.806
I was scorned as a powerless nobody...

39:18.895 --> 39:23.557
but my small band of Brown Shirts
grew into thousands...

39:24.650 --> 39:26.773
and the thousands into millions...

39:27.652 --> 39:30.902
and we conquered a third of the world!

39:31.113 --> 39:33.236
Sieg Heil!

39:37.369 --> 39:41.448
I again speak
to a small band of loyal followers...

39:42.123 --> 39:45.289
brought here from all over the world.

39:46.377 --> 39:49.876
Again, we shall grow into millions.

39:50.630 --> 39:52.457
History shall repeat itself.

39:52.549 --> 39:56.047
A new Anschluss has begun!

40:01.222 --> 40:03.927
When you men leave this location...

40:05.184 --> 40:06.892
you will return to the cells...

40:07.395 --> 40:11.854
which you will head in Latin America,
Europe, Africa.

40:12.775 --> 40:15.858
Those who remain
will launch the first assaults...

40:15.944 --> 40:19.442
wherein that flag
will be carried into battle.

40:21.156 --> 40:25.236
A police post tomorrow,
a provincial capital next week...

40:25.577 --> 40:30.404
and within days, weeks,
we shall see a world at war!

40:32.667 --> 40:34.492
Sieg Heil!

40:41.757 --> 40:44.213
Sieg Heil!

40:57.645 --> 40:58.891
Steve.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.520
Wonder Woman.

41:05.861 --> 41:07.984
You're not going to believe
what just happened.

41:08.072 --> 41:09.780
I know. I was there. I heard.

41:09.948 --> 41:11.857
But that was Adolf Hitler in the flesh.

41:11.949 --> 41:14.072
- Yes, I know.
- No, you don't understand.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.445
It was a cloned version of him,
just like he was back in the 1930s.

41:17.538 --> 41:21.241
You see, earlier, Diana Prince and I
found some papers of a Dr. Stern...

41:21.311 --> 41:24.384
who has been working
on cellular regenesis. Cloning.

41:24.419 --> 41:26.492
But he'd be crazy to think
that he could conquer...

41:26.587 --> 41:29.623
He was mad the first time around.
And from what I just heard...

41:29.715 --> 41:32.799
it's going to cost a few million lives
to prove him wrong again.

41:32.884 --> 41:35.339
Then this Dr. Stern
would have to be here, right?

41:36.887 --> 41:37.967
Right.

41:50.066 --> 41:53.232
I'm Capt. Hauptmann.
I'm relieving you. Report to your corporal.

42:02.284 --> 42:05.783
Dr. Stern, I presume. Or are you?

42:11.543 --> 42:13.202
You cannot lie. Who are you?

42:13.961 --> 42:15.870
I'm Dr. Heinrich von Klemper.

42:15.962 --> 42:17.955
And you made the clone of Adolf Hitler?

42:18.590 --> 42:19.704
Yes.

42:19.799 --> 42:21.590
Is the cloning process finished?

42:24.970 --> 42:27.721
No. He must have additional treatments...

42:27.806 --> 42:30.760
for complete stabilization
of the cellular structure.

42:30.851 --> 42:32.261
And when will that happen?

42:33.269 --> 42:36.602
The Führer is on his way here
accompanied by his bodyguard.

42:37.439 --> 42:39.063
You will be arrested and shot.

42:42.944 --> 42:44.142
What are you doing?

42:44.612 --> 42:48.027
The good doctor has just hired
a new lab assistant.

43:02.043 --> 43:03.206
Heil Hitler!

43:05.463 --> 43:09.924
Führer, this is my lab assistant.

43:10.926 --> 43:12.420
This way please, my Führer.

43:33.654 --> 43:35.563
Activate the reversal process.

43:37.365 --> 43:38.480
Never.

43:38.574 --> 43:41.148
Hold it. Lower your weapons.

43:41.911 --> 43:43.025
Sidearms, too.

43:44.413 --> 43:47.118
Keep your hands on your heads.
Back against the wall.

43:51.627 --> 43:55.292
Tell me how to activate
the reversal process. You cannot lie.

43:55.798 --> 43:56.912
Which dial?

43:57.591 --> 43:58.670
Answer me.

44:00.677 --> 44:03.084
Dials 4...

44:04.597 --> 44:07.882
6 and 8, in that order.

44:24.281 --> 44:25.478
Now what?

44:28.283 --> 44:31.699
Dial 11.

45:30.044 --> 45:31.752
- SeñorTrevor.
- It's Gaitan.

45:33.798 --> 45:36.502
Believe me, Doctor, we did the right thing.

45:40.095 --> 45:41.719
Would you take him out, Steve?

45:46.475 --> 45:47.590
Open the door.

46:15.792 --> 46:19.493
Steve, it is finished.

46:21.172 --> 46:22.286
Not quite.

46:47.670 --> 46:50.534
So he was cloned and then uncloned.

46:50.569 --> 46:51.442
That's it.

46:52.407 --> 46:55.656
And Wonder Woman helped you to find
the secret Nazi base?

46:55.743 --> 46:57.534
She was even there for the uncloning...

46:57.619 --> 47:00.240
but by then,
she had changed into a medical technician.

47:00.330 --> 47:02.156
And subsequently destroyed the lab.

47:04.125 --> 47:05.998
Well, it's your report, not mine.

47:06.961 --> 47:10.827
At least we have concrete evidence
that Anschluss 77 has been smashed.

47:11.047 --> 47:12.127
Beyond repair.

47:12.299 --> 47:14.125
Yes, that should please him.

47:15.677 --> 47:20.421
It's too bad you weren't there to witness
this magical transformation, Diana.

47:22.307 --> 47:23.718
But Wonder Woman was.

48:06.745 --> 48:11.391
