WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:04.421
Remember how I told you
my parents drop in unannounced?

00:04.504 --> 00:05.964
-Mm.
-I just got a text.

00:06.047 --> 00:07.632
They are coming here tomorrow.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.759
Okay.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.469
It's not "okay," Shaun, it's an ambush.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.722
My parents don't come to visit,
they come to judge.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.265
They hate everyone I date,

00:15.348 --> 00:18.476
which means they're gonna ask you
a ton of awkward questions.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.603
It's going to be uncomfortable.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.688
Very.

00:24.607 --> 00:25.525
Okay.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.738
You hate surprises.
Why aren't you more thrown by this?

00:29.821 --> 00:32.157
Because it's not a surprise.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.367
They're behaving exactly
the way you said.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.328
So a disaster is fine
as long as it's a predictable disaster?

00:37.412 --> 00:39.039
A disaster implies consequences.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.625
We're adults.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.669
Why would it matter
what your parents think?

00:44.753 --> 00:48.256
I don't know, because they're parents.

00:48.339 --> 00:49.549
Doesn't it bother you

00:49.632 --> 00:52.469
that your grumpy second dad Glassman
still doesn't like me?

00:52.552 --> 00:54.971
-Dr. Glassman likes you.
-No, he doesn't.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.308
[cell phone chimes]

01:00.018 --> 01:01.644
-I have to go.
-Fine.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.521
But I'm gonna text you
some talking points.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.023
Mostly subjects to avoid.

01:05.106 --> 01:07.192
And it's gonna be a very long list.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.319
[cell phone chimes]

01:15.533 --> 01:17.285
How long has she had this wound?

01:17.368 --> 01:18.495
Uh…

01:18.578 --> 01:21.122
She fell off the vault two months ago.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.918
Oh. Slow healing
and signs of oral bruising.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.419
Are you on a restricted diet?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.630
Coach put me on a performance diet.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.923
High protein, high fiber.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.467
I can show you her training log.
It's very standard stuff.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.552
[chuckles]
Although the noodles that she likes,

01:34.636 --> 01:36.554
they did a number on my stomach, too.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.348
-What noodles?
-Konjac.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.308
Girls on the squad eat them all the time.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.394
Konjac noodles were banned in Australia
several years ago.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.606
They're dangerous, basically indigestible.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.776
We will get another doctor
to assess your symptoms and do a workup.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.278
But we need to get Darya
to Imaging right away.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.083
I review my schedule,

02:05.166 --> 02:07.627
starting with the last appointment
and working backwards.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.212
It's an effective technique.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.965
You might want to write this down.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.343
Uncle Marcus, we had a deal.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.553
No special attention.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.932
That deal's off.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.518
Livvy, you're struggling,

02:23.601 --> 02:25.562
and I can't sit on the sidelines anymore.

02:25.645 --> 02:29.023
But special treatment from my uncle,
it's only going to make things worse.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.192
I owe it to you,
and I owe it to this hospital.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.652
I know you have unique talent.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.529
So you've noticed
both that I'm screwing up

02:34.612 --> 02:36.114
and that I have unique talent?

02:36.781 --> 02:39.284
I noticed the talent
long before you started here.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.662
Aunt Tilly's annual barbecue.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.709
You gave this to me
when you were five years old.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.879
And that moment, I knew you were special.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.094
[Claire] Hmm.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.598
Giant mass of fiber blocking
entry to her intestines.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.850
Her blood tests also show low calcium

03:03.933 --> 03:05.435
and other nutritional deficiencies.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.229
Can I see the 3D reconstructed images?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.898
It's unlikely to pass on its own.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.609
We'll have to break it up
and remove it endoscopically.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.652
She also needs to quit gymnastics.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.449
She has severe osteoporosis
with compression fractures

03:19.532 --> 03:21.576
in almost all
of the thoracic vertebrae.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.329
-Huh.
-Interesting.

03:24.412 --> 03:28.458
She is a 14-year-old girl with the bone
density of an 80-year-old woman.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.173
[theme music playing]

03:43.723 --> 03:45.391
[Shaun] You have kyphoscoliosis,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.810
caused by insufficient diet
and overtraining.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.188
We need to surgically stabilize
across the deformity

03:50.271 --> 03:52.857
to prevent the spine
from failure and paralysis.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.153
Spinal fusion…

03:57.237 --> 03:59.489
That means that she can't compete, right?

03:59.572 --> 04:00.865
Yes.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.867
And the Games,
they're less than a year away.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.453
Could we wait until after
to have the surgery?

04:06.454 --> 04:07.914
If left untreated,

04:07.997 --> 04:10.124
there's a 20% chance of progression,

04:10.208 --> 04:12.627
which could lead to respiratory failure
and death.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.717
[sighs]

04:21.469 --> 04:22.470
It's your call.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.851
I take risks every day.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.062
I'm not giving up my dream.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.815
[sighs] You're 14.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.692
It's not your call.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.820
Her mother passed away
when she was a baby.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.656
And my father just told you
it's my decision.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.285
Coach is my dad.

04:46.619 --> 04:50.456
Do what you need to do
to clear the blockage,

04:51.916 --> 04:53.626
but leave her spine alone.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.423
[Claire] She wants to risk her life
for a trophy,

04:58.506 --> 05:00.341
and her dad is okay with that.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.094
I mean, that has to be some form of abuse.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.221
This hospital is not gonna win a lawsuit

05:05.305 --> 05:08.683
against a caring father
who supports his daughter's dreams.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.518
All you can do is pull him aside

05:10.601 --> 05:12.437
and try to convince him to be responsible.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.522
[scoffs] Yeah.

05:15.690 --> 05:19.193
Convincing people to be responsible
has not been my strong suit lately.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.491
We're not still talking about
Coach Dad, are we?

05:25.575 --> 05:26.701
You've been avoiding me.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.869
I've been busy.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.829
Recovering from a motorcycle accident

05:29.912 --> 05:30.955
that you lied about?

05:31.039 --> 05:32.290
There's nothing to tell.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.791
I hit a patch of wet pavement.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.376
Well, Audrey… [sighs]

05:37.295 --> 05:39.422
You have PTSD.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.717
I'm dealing with it.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.469
I don't think you are.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.015
Well, I also have a truckload
of other things to deal with,

05:49.098 --> 05:51.142
including the annual surgical fundraiser

05:51.225 --> 05:52.477
Glassman just dumped in my lap.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.729
Yeah, parties, they're important.

05:59.942 --> 06:00.943
I'm dealing with it.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.281
Mm.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.708
How long have you had
the severe heartburn?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.127
Uh, six months, maybe a year.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.547
BP is 142 over 90. That's a little high.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.550
Yeah, well, Darya and I travel
a lot for competition.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.469
I don't take care of myself.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.763
Prioritizing your work
over health is a bad idea.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.098
For you and your daughter.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.140
Thank you.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.934
But may I kindly remind you,

06:33.017 --> 06:34.977
how long are the shifts
that you doctors work?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.355
High stress, no sleep.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.608
When something is important,
huh, you give it all you got.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.194
True. But we're adults. Darya's not.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.780
Yeah, but she's very different
from other girls her age.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.950
I mean, Darya, she works her butt off.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.912
She's earned my r… respect.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.456
You okay?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.583
Oh, I'm feeling some kind of chest pain.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.336
-[monitor alarm]
-His oxygen sat and pressure's dropping.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.255
[gasping]

07:03.339 --> 07:06.592
Possible MI, lung problem,
or aortic aneurysm. Secure his airway.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.097
Poor perfusion. I think he's septic.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.016
And vitals aren't improving.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.685
Might be a spontaneous pneumothorax

07:15.768 --> 07:16.936
and trapped air in his chest.

07:19.730 --> 07:22.942
No, his chest would sound like
a kettle drum. There's fluid in there.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.195
Give me a blade, curved clamp,
and a chest tube.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.910
[Dr. Andrews]
Boerhaave syndrome is easily misdiagnosed.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.371
Nice catch
with the percussion technique.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.665
You may have saved this man's life.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.584
[monitor beeping]

07:40.293 --> 07:41.502
Give me more retraction.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.212
These tissue planes are terrible.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.050
We're gonna have
to debride the mediastinum.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.429
There's too much damage
to repair the esophagus

07:51.512 --> 07:53.139
without risking a chronic fistula.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.891
The ongoing leakage into his chest

07:54.974 --> 07:58.394
means it would just be a matter of time
before he dies from an infection.

08:00.897 --> 08:04.192
The safest approach would be
to permanently divert the esophagus.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.361
And he'd have to eat through a tube
for the rest of his life.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.863
But I don't see a better option.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.160
In 24 hours, with broad spectrum
antibiotics and drains,

08:14.243 --> 08:17.079
the infection could clear
and give us more options.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.251
Which buys everyone time
to come up with another brilliant win.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.593
[Asher] Does she really
call her own father "Coach"?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.178
He is her coach.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.347
What do you call your father?

08:34.430 --> 08:36.390
-Abba.
-Pass.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.934
Frank.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.353
That's his name.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.814
-Mm.
-Do you respect any traditions?

08:43.898 --> 08:44.857
Not random ones.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.568
Why create labels
for things that already have names?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.737
It's not just what Darya calls her dad,

08:49.820 --> 08:52.073
it's how they act with each other.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.783
They're like coworkers.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.618
That doesn't sound bad.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.371
If I were meeting
Lea's co-workers tomorrow,

08:58.454 --> 08:59.872
she would be much less anxious.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.124
Family is supposed
to make you anxious.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.419
Introducing a new boyfriend
to your parents, it's a big deal.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.129
It's a rite of passage.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.092
[monitor alarm]

09:11.175 --> 09:12.843
Polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.262
Torsade de Pointes.

-Clear.

[defibrillator thumps]

09:33.656 --> 09:36.075
[alarm stops, beeping resumes]

09:37.618 --> 09:39.245
Did we do something wrong?

09:40.830 --> 09:41.914
No.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.291
Which is puzzling.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.711
Mistakes by first-year residents
are expected,

09:46.794 --> 09:50.423
but cardiac arrhythmia
in a 14-year-old is definitely unexpected.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.140
I was gonna ask if you wanted a ride,

09:59.223 --> 10:00.850
but if you're working late…

10:00.933 --> 10:02.310
Twenty hours to figure this out.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.229
You sure you want to waste one of them
driving home and back?

10:06.272 --> 10:07.398
I think while I drive.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.235
Not as well. Not in the car. Not at home.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.821
Too comfortable, too many distractions.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.325
Better to buckle down here, where,
as a bonus, your colleagues can see you.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.453
[scoffs] I was under the impression
that results are more important

10:20.536 --> 10:21.912
than how a doctor is perceived.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.415
And Jordan is running rings
around you there, too.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.501
Results don't matter
if you can't make people listen.

10:30.129 --> 10:33.883
Is that why you didn't want to perform
the esophageal diversion?

10:33.966 --> 10:35.217
You didn't hear me?

10:36.844 --> 10:38.054
[exhales sharply]

10:39.722 --> 10:42.892
I made a decision
for the good of the patient.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.061
Now,

10:45.728 --> 10:48.230
it's up to you to prove me right.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.941
[door opens]

10:52.109 --> 10:53.319
[door closes]

10:53.402 --> 10:57.782
She has a prolonged QT interval
and sporadic extra beats.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.409
Okay, I'm gonna get the newbies

11:00.493 --> 11:03.454
to recheck the renal panel

11:03.537 --> 11:05.956
and order endocrine and genetic studies.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.918
I already did. Also a tox and drug screen.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.797
Are you okay?

11:14.715 --> 11:15.716
Mm.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.676
Lea's scared.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.721
Mm.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.182
Then I should prepare myself.

11:23.265 --> 11:27.103
There is definitely something about me
her parents won't like.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.270
No, Shaun.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.606
You are who you are.

11:30.689 --> 11:31.982
Who you are is great.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.487
You've been preparing for this
your entire life.

11:36.570 --> 11:40.408
When you do something important
for the first time,

11:40.491 --> 11:42.368
like surgery, you practice.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.537
I should practice meeting her parents.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.082
Mm, how? It's not like there's a simulator

11:48.165 --> 11:51.585
for learning how to navigate
awkward social interactions.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.589
There is.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.467
But I need pizza.

12:03.139 --> 12:03.973
Hmm.

12:06.016 --> 12:09.353
Shaun, I'd like you to meet my parents,
Pam and Mike.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.439
[soft jazz playing]

12:11.897 --> 12:13.107
Hi, Pam.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.985
Hi, Mike.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.530
[chewing]

12:22.741 --> 12:24.827
Lea tells us you're a doctor.
What specialty?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.370
I am a surgeon.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.998
What a shame. I hear surgeons
are arrogant and overrated.

12:31.083 --> 12:31.959
[Dr. Glassman] Okay.

12:32.042 --> 12:35.129
Morgan, I'm sorry, but can you just
give it a rest for half a second?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.298
I'm in character.
Please address me as Pam.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.592
[clears throat]

12:40.468 --> 12:42.595
I read recently that,
while you're sleeping,

12:42.678 --> 12:44.805
you accidentally eat
eight spiders every year.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.811
Yes.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.607
And I read that, sometimes,
they lay eggs in your stomach,

12:54.690 --> 12:56.901
and then you can have
thousands of spiders…

12:56.984 --> 12:57.818
Shaun.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.403
You said not to disagree with him

12:59.487 --> 13:01.322
when he says something wrong
and pointless.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.907
I didn't tell you to agree with him,

13:02.990 --> 13:05.659
because that only gives him
more wrong and pointless things.

13:05.743 --> 13:06.619
[liquid pouring]

13:06.702 --> 13:09.121
Good. That's helpful.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.041
Let's continue.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.753
Did you know that Arizona
doesn't have Daylight Savings Time?

13:15.836 --> 13:17.046
Saving.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.426
It's "saving," not "savings."
That's grammatic…

13:26.514 --> 13:30.100
Wh… How am I supposed to know
what is pointless?

13:30.184 --> 13:31.268
Facts are facts.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.354
Okay, okay, okay.
This isn't gonna work.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.105
We could spend
the rest of the evening

13:35.189 --> 13:38.901
teaching Shaun the fine but trivial art
of how to finesse trivia.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.194
But the real problem

13:40.277 --> 13:42.446
isn't gonna be small talk
and family bickering.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.782
The real problem is
what happens when Lea's parents

13:44.865 --> 13:47.701
express real concerns
about their daughter?

13:47.785 --> 13:50.621
-What concerns?
-Concerns any parent would have.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.997
You two barely know each other,

13:52.081 --> 13:54.833
you haven't been dating very long,
now you're living together.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.336
This relationship is moving too fast.

14:00.005 --> 14:00.839
You're wrong.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.176
I thought you said
we shouldn't argue with your dad.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.428
That wasn't my dad.
That was 100% Glassy.

14:07.388 --> 14:11.183
You can't prepare
for how these evenings can go wrong.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.726
Families are full of surprises.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.311
Like how you don't like Lea.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.781
[clears throat]
I never actually said that.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.409
[scoffs]

14:39.503 --> 14:41.422
[footsteps approach]

14:41.505 --> 14:43.632
Wow. A first-year all-nighter.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.467
Brings back memories.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.844
Not of myself, of course,

14:46.927 --> 14:49.388
but of the losers who thought
staying up all night

14:49.471 --> 14:52.308
drooling on their laptops
made them look like better doctors.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.227
So, cure cancer yet?

14:56.437 --> 14:59.857
I'm trying to find a new way
to repair a ruptured esophagus.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.943
"Fundic reinforcement
with intercostal muscle flap."

15:03.027 --> 15:06.488
Pretty cutting-edge stuff. But why not
go with diversion? It's a lot safer.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.575
Because "safe"
is ordinary and boring. Like me.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.994
My uncle thinks I need a win.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.456
And the only way to do that
is to be impressive, like Jordan.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.374
Makes sense.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.710
You agree?

15:19.793 --> 15:22.880
That Dr. Allen is impressive? Yeah.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.048
And everybody knows that

15:24.131 --> 15:27.092
because Dr. Allen makes sure
everybody knows that.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.179
She and your uncle are cut
from the same fashionably high-end cloth.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.139
So, I don't just need to be
a better doctor,

15:32.222 --> 15:34.266
-I need to be a different person.
-Wow.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.268
You might want to start
by being a person

15:36.352 --> 15:38.479
who feels a little less sorry
for themselves.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.566
Either you're an awkward,
inconsistent loner

15:42.650 --> 15:45.402
who's irritatingly apologetic
about your best qualities,

15:45.486 --> 15:47.404
or you're a quietly brilliant surgeon

15:47.488 --> 15:49.281
whom others ignore at their own peril.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.699
If you're the first one,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.534
quit now and stop wasting resources.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.620
But if you're the second, be that.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.875
Maybe a little louder.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.922
[papers rustle]

16:10.552 --> 16:13.847
[inhales and exhales sharply]

16:13.931 --> 16:16.350
[Claire] Where should we start?

16:17.267 --> 16:20.437
Centerpieces, appetizers, color schemes?

16:20.521 --> 16:23.190
Please tell me that you're at a hotel
in the middle of the day

16:23.273 --> 16:24.608
because you're having an affair.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.235
There were no surgeries scheduled,

16:26.318 --> 16:28.278
so I decided to volunteer to help.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.989
-How helpful.
-Hmm.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.408
We can get the job done
in half the time

16:32.491 --> 16:34.326
and still have time to talk.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.246
Or we can just talk.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.581
I am not a 14-year-old girl

16:39.665 --> 16:42.001
whose next backflip
could kill her, Claire.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.085
I don't need saving.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.008
What do you think about twinkle lights?

16:49.550 --> 16:50.759
Too prom?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.641
[Enrique] Our tests show
that your heart problems

16:57.725 --> 16:59.643
are being caused
by excess estrogen levels.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.187
[Asher] And we want to know
how it got in your system.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.106
Medication? A supplement?

17:04.189 --> 17:06.984
Coach gave you my training logs.
You know as much as I do.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.155
We also know that
you're in a very competitive sport,

17:11.238 --> 17:14.283
so, maybe you're taking something
that's not on the training log.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.326
If you are, we can't
divulge that to anyone.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.619
You think I'm doping?

17:18.996 --> 17:19.830
No way.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.957
-If your coach is pressuring you…
-He's not.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.086
I'm sure it's a one-time thing.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.172
Keep monitoring me.
I'll be fine.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.676
Darya, you've made
your dreams come true

17:32.760 --> 17:35.637
by being stubborn, being relentless,

17:35.721 --> 17:37.347
and just making things happen,

17:37.431 --> 17:40.893
but that's not how your heart works.
Or your spine.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.603
She's not being stubborn.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.524
It is going to go away, isn't it?

17:49.193 --> 17:50.861
Because you are taking something.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.449
And now you're going to stop.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.581
Which means that it wasn't
performance enhancing.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.958
What is it for?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.590
You took drugs for boobs?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.343
The girl on YouTube said
it would make them bigger.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.303
Phytoestrogens used in herbal remedies

18:16.386 --> 18:18.347
can cause swelling in breast tissue,

18:18.430 --> 18:21.058
but there are potentially
dangerous side effects.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.227
What the hell were you thinking?

18:23.310 --> 18:25.229
I didn't know it would make me sick.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.149
I got tired of hearing
the boys on the men's team

18:29.233 --> 18:30.651
talking about women with curves…

18:30.734 --> 18:33.821
What if it showed up on a drug test?

18:33.904 --> 18:36.156
What if you got banned
from the Olympics?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.200
It's natural. It doesn't mess
with performance.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.410
-Other girls…
-I don't care about other girls,

18:40.494 --> 18:43.330
and I didn't think that you cared
about other girls. Are you…

18:43.413 --> 18:44.331
[sighs]

18:45.541 --> 18:49.169
I can't believe that you're
willing to risk everything

18:50.587 --> 18:53.799
for something so childish.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.135
It's not childish.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.636
I give a lot to my sport.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.722
I just wanted something for me.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.352
You're not an adult.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.314
Mm.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.153
[exhales sharply]

19:22.035 --> 19:23.245
Fix her heart

19:24.413 --> 19:25.789
and her spine.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.376
[stammers] What?
You can't do that. Are you punishing me?

19:29.459 --> 19:30.961
I'm doing my job.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.799
I'm your father, and we're a family,

19:35.883 --> 19:38.760
and it is my job to make good decisions
when you won't.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.307
[voice breaking] Since when
is being my father your job?

19:44.933 --> 19:48.145
We never do anything
but talk about gymnastics, not even Mom.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.566
If you didn't think I needed my father
after she died, why start now?

19:52.649 --> 19:53.734
Darya…

19:57.279 --> 20:00.032
I'm calling the team lawyer
and filing for emancipation.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.785
You think I can't make
my own decisions? Try this one.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.538
You're fired, Coach.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.062
[Dr. Park] We could try T-tubes.

20:30.145 --> 20:33.607
They result in the formation of a
controlled fistula and route for drainage.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.567
Interesting.
But the patient would still have

20:35.651 --> 20:37.945
a long recovery and chance of reinfection.
What else?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.821
I found some very interesting research

20:39.905 --> 20:41.365
on endoscopic vacuum therapy.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.326
It's under investigation
for the management of esophageal leaks.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.995
Definitely innovative,
Dr. Allen, but a little too much so.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.665
This concept hasn't even gone
through clinical trials yet,

20:49.748 --> 20:51.667
and we need to perform surgery today.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.004
Dr. Jackson, you've been quiet.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.677
I was thinking about
fundic reinforcement.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.721
My idea is to use
the patient's own good tissue

21:04.805 --> 21:06.556
to reinforce the primary closure.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.059
In this case,
using the stomach as the patch.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.437
Like the way we use a skin graft
for third-degree burns.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.317
Well, he'd be at risk
of a diaphragmatic hernia.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.821
Not if we cinch up the lower esophageal
sphincter with a fundoplasty.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.751
[glass thuds]

21:43.093 --> 21:44.136
Mm.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.932
Shaun, Lea tells us you're a doctor.
What's your specialty?

21:50.309 --> 21:51.810
I am a surgeon.

21:51.893 --> 21:55.105
But we are not all arrogant.
Though many of us are.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.399
I'm still not sure if that's good or bad.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.736
[Lea clears throat]

22:01.653 --> 22:02.821
[chuckles nervously]

22:03.488 --> 22:05.240
Is it hard? For you?

22:07.784 --> 22:09.286
I mean, it's a difficult job.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.288
Shaun is excellent at his job.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.166
[sighs]

22:17.461 --> 22:19.171
So, how do you feel about vaccines?

22:19.254 --> 22:20.672
[softly] Oh, my God.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.632
Because, uh, they worry me.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.510
They don't worry me.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.470
-Oh.
-Really?

22:26.553 --> 22:28.138
Because we've read a lot of stuff.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.515
Especially since Lea told us about you.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.143
Vaccines don't cause autism, Mom.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.353
-Want to talk about religion now?
-[chuckles]

22:35.437 --> 22:37.731
[softly] I think that that was on the list

22:37.814 --> 22:39.816
-of things not to talk about.
-Mm.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.901
Lea wrote you a list?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.194
-Dad.
-Well…

22:42.277 --> 22:46.031
Honestly, Lea, if we're so impossible
to talk to, why even have us here?

22:46.448 --> 22:47.699
Hemorrhoid surgery.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.953
-Excuse me?
-Want more wine?

22:52.037 --> 22:53.371
I removed a hemorrhoid

22:53.455 --> 22:55.499
from a patient with terminal cancer.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.418
He only had a few months to live,
and nothing would change that,

22:58.502 --> 23:00.712
but the surgery did make him
more comfortable.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.927
I suggest we treat this evening
like hemorrhoid surgery.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.220
[sighs]

23:10.055 --> 23:11.473
[chuckles]

23:14.101 --> 23:16.103
Now, that's… That's a good point.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.730
[both laugh]

23:18.814 --> 23:21.316
You don't have to give him
any more lists. Let him talk.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.443
I like this guy. [chuckles]

23:24.069 --> 23:25.153
Okay.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.531
To hemorrhoid surgery.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.325
-[Mike chuckles] To hemorrhoid surgery.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.798
I went to see a psychiatrist.

I'm… I'm so relieved to hear that.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.094
Well, once.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.639
The doctor said my symptoms

38:06.200 --> 38:08.202
Of course it was, and it was brilliant…

38:08.286 --> 38:10.162
And neither was the stone.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.292
That story you told me about
how you spotted my talent?

38:14.917 --> 38:16.544
Um, I don't remember any of it.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.381
I didn't paint that rock,

38:20.464 --> 38:22.591
and if I handed it to you,

38:22.675 --> 38:24.635
it didn't mean anything
because I was five.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.015
You have been carrying around
a memory for over 20 years

38:29.098 --> 38:31.851
that represents your dream, not mine.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.811
Clearly, that's not entirely true.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.229
You went to medical school.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.523
Because I do want to be a great doctor.

38:38.232 --> 38:39.650
I wanted it so bad

38:39.734 --> 38:42.987
that I let you push me
to think up some flashy surgery,

38:43.070 --> 38:45.698
even when my instincts already told me

38:45.781 --> 38:47.700
to do what I thought was the right thing,

38:47.783 --> 38:49.744
and was the right thing.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.787
Livvy, I just want to help you
be the best…

38:51.871 --> 38:53.331
You want me to be Jordan.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.419
If you're looking to mold someone
in your image, she's perfect.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.882
But, Uncle Marcus, I've got to be me.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.177
And you can't help me do that.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.353
Hey.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.817
I'm still gonna brag on you
like a proud uncle. You know that, right?

39:21.901 --> 39:23.110
[chuckles]

39:34.663 --> 39:36.082
Dr. Jackson.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.375
[chuckles]

39:47.718 --> 39:49.136
[knock on door]

40:00.314 --> 40:01.315
[door closes]

40:01.399 --> 40:04.110
-It's your parents.
-Yep, Shaun. I saw.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.861
They probably want something.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.114
We should prepare.
Either they want to yell at us,

40:08.197 --> 40:10.074
in which case,
we should not answer the door,

40:10.157 --> 40:11.575
or they want to take us for dinner…

40:11.659 --> 40:13.661
-[chimes]
-…but we are already halfway through…

40:13.744 --> 40:15.162
They want to take us to dinner.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.249
Should I open the door?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.042
What do you think?

40:22.336 --> 40:23.546
I think…

40:29.635 --> 40:32.471
…they must have been good parents.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.018
We should have dinner with them.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.105
Do you want to text them back?

40:43.232 --> 40:44.233
[cell phone thuds]

40:49.905 --> 40:50.906
[sighs]

41:06.255 --> 41:08.799
Last year, after my mom died,

41:08.883 --> 41:12.386
I was going through
some problems emotionally.

41:13.053 --> 41:15.556
I was diagnosed with PTSD.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.309
I see.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.518
Melendez knew.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.271
Um… Morgan found out
because she's Morgan.

41:22.354 --> 41:24.440
But I didn't tell anyone else.

41:24.523 --> 41:25.941
I… I didn't want anyone to know.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.777
Why are you telling me this now?

41:30.237 --> 41:31.447
Because

41:33.032 --> 41:36.202
Lim is going through something like it,

41:36.285 --> 41:37.203
but maybe worse.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.998
She isn't going to therapy.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.750
She has refused medication. She…

41:42.833 --> 41:44.835
Um… [exhales sharply]

41:44.919 --> 41:47.213
I don't think you should
be telling me this.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.589
Whatever Lim told you,

41:48.672 --> 41:50.883
she told you in confidence
and as a friend.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.385
Mm. But she's not just a friend.
She's my boss.

41:55.054 --> 41:56.138
You're her boss.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.016
So I'm telling you because

41:59.767 --> 42:01.519
I have no place else to turn.

42:02.144 --> 42:04.355
[exhales sharply]
She won't let me help

42:04.438 --> 42:06.857
because she says it's not my job.
And she's right.

42:09.193 --> 42:12.696
But it's your job to protect the hospital.

42:14.156 --> 42:15.366
And her.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.704
So…

42:30.965 --> 42:32.967
[closing theme music playing]
