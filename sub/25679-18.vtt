Previously on

00:03.602 --> 00:04.771
{\an8}"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood:
The Reunion"...

00:04.838 --> 00:06.406
{\an9}You wench!

00:06.473 --> 00:08.942
{\an8}Safaree,
did you sleep with Lyrica?

00:09.008 --> 00:11.544
{\an8}Ab... solutely... not.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.180
{\an8}That broke
my (bleep) heart!

00:14.247 --> 00:17.283
{\an8}A1... you are the father.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.552
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

00:19.619 --> 00:20.887
{\an8}Are you better than me?

00:20.954 --> 00:22.055
{\an8}That's 'cause you (bleep)
the right (bleep).

00:22.122 --> 00:23.390
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep).

00:23.456 --> 00:24.858
{\an8}She loves playing
the victim role.

00:24.924 --> 00:26.459
{\an8}Until you're walking
in my shoes,

00:26.526 --> 00:28.395
{\an8}go (bleep) (bleep) yourself.

00:28.461 --> 00:29.929
{\an7}Ridiculous (bleep)
going on.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.932
{\an8}She came to your house, son,
looking like a, a (bleep) clown.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.769
{\an8}Pam, you will not be
at my child's birth.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.270
{\an8}You are
so (bleep) disrespectful.

00:37.337 --> 00:39.172
{\an8}I don't care!
Shut the (bleep) up now!

00:39.239 --> 00:41.141
{\an8}You bitch!

00:41.207 --> 00:45.712
{\an8}You're not Ray J.
You're not even A1!

00:41.207 --> 00:45.712
{\an5}Shut up, (bleep)!

00:45.779 --> 00:48.515
{\an5}You better watch
your goddamn tone, bitch.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.515
{\an1}I ain't gotta watch
a mother(bleep) thing.

00:48.581 --> 00:51.284
{\an8}You mother(bleep)
womanizing (bleep).

00:51.351 --> 00:53.686
{\an8}Lock me up,
throw away the key.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.355
{\an8}Fake-ass bitch!

00:53.753 --> 00:55.355
{\an8}You called me!

00:55.422 --> 00:57.357
{\an8}You said it, bitch, (bleep) you.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.357
{\an7}I said what the (bleep)
I said.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.459
{\an8}Everybody lying.
You lying, he lying.

00:59.526 --> 01:01.060
{\an8}I ain't never lied
in my life.

01:01.127 --> 01:03.530
{\an8}(whooping and jeering)

01:03.596 --> 01:06.566
{\an8}(Nina)
And tonight on "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion"...

01:06.633 --> 01:08.401
{\an8}I wanna sleep
with the chocolate wife.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.170
{\an8}I would gladly
(bleep) her (bleep).

01:10.236 --> 01:12.005
{\an8}You need to be
over here with me.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.240
{\an8}Your (bleep) never went in me.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.240
{\an8}Man, you a (bleep) liar.

01:14.307 --> 01:17.243
{\an4}Teairra,
did his (bleep) go in me?

01:14.307 --> 01:17.243
{\an1}I didn't see no (bleep)
in no (bleep).

01:17.310 --> 01:20.814
{\an8}I would have given you
the world, 'cause I loved you!

01:20.880 --> 01:22.282
{\an8}You're a liar.

01:22.348 --> 01:23.683
{\an8}You (bleep) hefty-ass thief.

01:22.348 --> 01:23.683
{\an8}Aw...

01:23.750 --> 01:25.251
{\an8}Do you think Booby popped up

01:25.318 --> 01:27.520
{\an8}because he's still
in love with Brooke?

01:27.587 --> 01:28.922
{\an8}(audience oohing)

01:28.988 --> 01:31.691
{\an7}I was looking at her when she
actually sent that video.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.693
{\an8}(audience exclaiming)

01:33.760 --> 01:39.966
{\an7}To have no regard for
an unborn life is not normal.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.368
{\an8}No, no, no. Nope.

01:48.341 --> 01:49.876
{\an8}Come again, Akbar?

01:48.341 --> 01:49.876
{\an7}You can say
whatever you want about me.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.478
{\an8}The world...
I lay my (bleep) out.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.647
{\an8}You the one who's a liar
and a manipulator. You.

01:54.714 --> 01:56.749
{\an8}Whoever she (bleep) now
is missing...

01:56.816 --> 01:58.284
{\an7}Talking about her drinking
is wrong.

01:56.816 --> 01:58.284
{\an5}(voices overlapping)

01:58.351 --> 02:00.753
{\an1}Talking about
her drinking is wrong.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.223
{\an6}Yo, yo, yo!

02:00.820 --> 02:03.223
{\an1}Talking about her drinking
is wrong.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.824
No, no, no. Nope.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.059
{\an5}(audience exclaiming)

02:04.891 --> 02:06.059
Now we throwing shoes.

02:09.662 --> 02:14.467
(laughter and applause)

02:14.534 --> 02:17.904
{\an8}Everybody wanna throw a shoe
everywhere, that's a shame.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.572
{\an5}(bleep) these hoes.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.572
{\an4}(Roccstar)
Don't pass out, Moniece,
don't pass out.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.109
No, thank you.
You don't pass out.

02:23.176 --> 02:26.346
{\an8}You're sick in the head,
so don't you pass out.

02:23.176 --> 02:26.346
{\an5}Daddy got you.

02:26.412 --> 02:27.413
{\an8}(Nina)
Sit down.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.852
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay, so, we need to
bring it back a minute.

02:32.919 --> 02:35.154
Let me just ask Alejandra,
and I'm gonna ask Sade,

02:35.221 --> 02:38.424
because he says that he likes
women who have been counted out.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.792
He said "broken."

02:39.859 --> 02:41.995
Do you feel like you were
broken when you met him?

02:42.061 --> 02:43.363
{\an1}I think I was
a little bit lost.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.531
{\an7}I--

02:43.429 --> 02:44.531
{\an8}You were.

02:44.597 --> 02:47.400
{\an8}--just moved to L.A..

02:44.597 --> 02:47.400
{\an8}(audience gasps)

02:47.467 --> 02:50.603
{\an1}I didn't have any structure
in my life.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.039
This ain't structure,
this is (bleep) crazy.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.641
{\an5}I was being dependent--

02:53.106 --> 02:54.641
Mm-hmm.

02:54.707 --> 02:58.011
--so when he came into my life,
he separated me from that world

02:58.077 --> 02:59.412
of living the Hollywood life.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.848
Sade, did you feel
that you were in a broken place

03:01.915 --> 03:02.916
when you met him?

03:02.982 --> 03:04.918
Akbar changed
my entire life.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.753
He's done way more good
in my life than bad.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.922
I would never say
he's a womanizer

03:08.988 --> 03:11.558
{\an5}and he's controlling
and all of these things
that she said,

03:11.624 --> 03:13.860
{\an1}but you need somebody to control
you in some type of way.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.129
{\an5}No, I don't,
you don't know me, baby.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.129
{\an1}Yes, you do, baby,
you're a drunk.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.463
{\an5}I don't know what he told you.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.463
You're a drunk.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.932
{\an5}You don't even have
a green screen.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.932
{\an1}Girl...

03:18.998 --> 03:20.700
(audience whooping and jeering)

03:20.767 --> 03:23.269
{\an1}Girl, I don't give a (bleep)
about no green screen.

03:23.336 --> 03:24.771
{\an5}We need to stop.

03:23.336 --> 03:24.771
{\an1}We've been getting paid
for the past five years...

03:24.837 --> 03:26.739
{\an5}We gotta stop, we gotta stop.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.739
{\an1}...bitch.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.374
{\an5}And what are you?

03:26.806 --> 03:28.374
{\an5}(Akbar)
You know, because
you look at it like this.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.143
{\an8}When people drink and they
get drunk, whatever, right,

03:30.209 --> 03:31.945
{\an8}they throw up,
they look stupid, right?

03:32.011 --> 03:33.513
When you in love,
it's the same thing.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.214
{\an5}Were you in love with Teairra?

03:33.580 --> 03:35.214
No.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.349
(audience scoffing)

03:36.416 --> 03:37.951
You got Teairra
flying to Dallas,

03:38.017 --> 03:40.086
you got Teairra doing things
out of the norm,

03:40.153 --> 03:41.387
'cause that's what love does.

03:41.454 --> 03:42.589
When you have
an addictive personality...

03:42.655 --> 03:45.124
to me,
she was addicted to me.

03:45.191 --> 03:46.859
{\an1}Why would you put yourself
in a situation,

03:46.926 --> 03:48.728
{\an1}if you're not
in love with a woman

03:48.795 --> 03:50.830
{\an1}that may be
a little bit broken,

03:50.897 --> 03:53.666
that doesn't have a lot of
the same survival instincts

03:53.733 --> 03:56.336
{\an1}that these two women
might already be equipped with,

03:56.402 --> 03:57.503
{\an1}and also,

03:57.570 --> 03:58.871
{\an1}because of
the vulnerable space

03:58.938 --> 04:01.007
{\an1}that you've already
acknowledged that she's in,

04:01.074 --> 04:03.076
{\an1}that they know as women
that she's in

04:03.142 --> 04:05.345
{\an1}and they're not
taking any initiative

04:05.411 --> 04:07.480
{\an1}to uplift her,
why would you do that?

04:07.547 --> 04:09.248
Teairra knew
about my lifestyle.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.351
{\an5}She did.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.351
I did not know
about your lifestyle.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.685
{\an5}If you, if you...

04:11.417 --> 04:12.685
You lied to me the whole time.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.621
Teairra wanted me
to get rid of my women.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.022
{\an5}She wanted to be the only one.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.022
No, no, baby.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.757
{\an5}You came to me.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.757
At no point...

04:17.824 --> 04:19.425
{\an5}You're a liar.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.425
{\an1}No.

04:19.492 --> 04:22.161
{\an5}She's not...

04:19.492 --> 04:22.161
And your fake jewelry
that I got appraised.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.663
(voices overlapping)

04:23.730 --> 04:25.431
Everything they got on is fake.

04:25.498 --> 04:26.499
Yeah, it is.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.301
(voices overlapping)

04:28.368 --> 04:31.738
{\an5}All right, everybody,
everybody take a beat.
Everybody, take a beat.

04:31.804 --> 04:33.940
{\an4}I really would like
to hear Akbar's response.

04:31.804 --> 04:33.940
Okay.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.642
'Cause you know, even
in your situation, you...

04:35.708 --> 04:36.776
{\an5}a beautiful woman--

04:35.708 --> 04:36.776
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

04:36.843 --> 04:37.944
--and you dealt
with other men.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.345
You was dealing
with multiple men.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.247
{\an5}Okay.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.247
You need to be
over here with me.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.315
You feel me?

04:42.382 --> 04:44.584
{\an5}Is that not true?

04:42.382 --> 04:44.584
It is true.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.386
So, like you.
So, what is the difference?

04:46.452 --> 04:48.221
{\an5}(Nina)
Wait a minute..

04:46.452 --> 04:48.221
{\an1}I'm talking about
your dealings with Teairra.

04:48.287 --> 04:50.490
{\an1}I'm not asking
about the situation.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.725
{\an4}You have somebody
that's broken--

04:50.556 --> 04:52.725
You guys...
You guys gotta stop.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.061
Bridget, I need you to stop.
I need you to stop for a second.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.996
{\an4}It seems like y'all got
an arrangement that works
for y'all,

04:57.063 --> 04:58.831
{\an5}so I don't care about that.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.831
It's not an arrangement,

04:58.898 --> 05:00.633
{\an5}So what is it, so what is it?

04:58.898 --> 05:00.633
{\an1}--and that's one thing
that you don't know,

05:00.700 --> 05:01.834
{\an4}so I wanna share
a little bit.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.834
{\an1}Okay.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.770
When you first meet someone,

05:03.836 --> 05:06.139
you see yourself
how can you help them.

05:06.205 --> 05:07.740
{\an4}Right.

05:06.205 --> 05:07.740
That's what happened with him.

05:07.807 --> 05:11.411
So he felt that he maybe could
help her in some type of way.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.879
People call me the devil.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.414
I'll take all that,
because God created us all.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.215
He gonna use me however
he wanna use me, good or bad.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.917
{\an5}He ain't using you,
the devil is.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.917
So at the end of the day,

05:17.984 --> 05:19.585
let me tell you,
so when I saw Teairra,

05:19.652 --> 05:21.721
I also saw talent--
the girl can sing.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.723
{\an5}Oh, baby, I sing.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.723
{\an1}Like, I wanted her to sing,
I wanted her to get out there.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.525
No, you a liar.
You saw opportunity.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.760
{\an5}(audience)
Yeah!

05:25.591 --> 05:27.760
Guys, we gotta stop.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.662
There is more
to get into, okay?

05:29.729 --> 05:32.098
As Teairra's relationship
with Akbar unraveled,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.966
she suffered
the highest form of betrayal

05:34.033 --> 05:37.203
when her sex tape was leaked
and made headlines.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.906
But if revenge porn
is a dish best served cold,

05:39.972 --> 05:41.441
Teairra sought to respond

05:41.507 --> 05:44.277
with her own dish,
served with a lawsuit.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.779
{\an8}I text Akbar last night
and I told him,

05:46.846 --> 05:50.183
{\an8}"You got me (bleep) up, I don't
want any part of your harem,"

05:50.249 --> 05:53.553
{\an8}and then he texts me
and said, "Teairra...

05:53.619 --> 05:57.056
{\an8}somebody stole my phone
with our sex tapes in it."

05:57.123 --> 05:59.826
{\an8}Next thing I know, I wake up
at my girlfriend's house

05:59.892 --> 06:02.128
{\an8}and the whole (bleep)
is on the internet.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.964
{\an7}You were the only person
that had them.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.466
{\an7}Somebody told me
they released it on your page.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.900
{\an8}How it get on your page?

06:07.967 --> 06:09.602
{\an8}'Cause you had my password.

06:09.669 --> 06:10.970
{\an8}You lying again.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.172
{\an7}People are questioning me
at this point.

06:13.239 --> 06:16.175
{\an7}So what I have to do
is go full forward

06:16.242 --> 06:17.944
{\an8}with a (bleep) lawsuit.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.879
{\an8}Oh, so you gonna sue him.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.180
{\an8}(bleep) with the wrong bitch.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.782
{\an8}We're filing a lawsuit today

06:22.849 --> 06:25.718
{\an7}against a man
who we believe is responsible

06:25.785 --> 06:27.053
{\an8}for the revenge porn posts.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.187
{\an8}He didn't do this.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.655
{\an8}I did it.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.357
(audience exclaiming)

06:31.424 --> 06:32.925
Okay, Teairra, um,
how did you feel

06:32.992 --> 06:35.828
when you initially saw that
the video had made the internet?

06:35.895 --> 06:38.564
{\an1}At first, I wanted to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

06:38.631 --> 06:41.134
Love makes you blind
and do dumb (bleep).

06:41.200 --> 06:42.835
Akbar, I wanna know,

06:42.902 --> 06:45.638
what is the status
of the charges against you?

06:45.705 --> 06:46.706
Well, I'm a victim myself.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.207
I did not leak the tape.

06:48.274 --> 06:50.443
I've been accused of leaking
the tape the entire time.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.944
My private parts
is being shown.

06:52.011 --> 06:54.247
{\an5}(laughter)

06:52.011 --> 06:54.247
That you put out.

06:54.313 --> 06:58.217
He told me, "Somebody stole my
phone with our videos in 'em."

06:58.284 --> 07:01.020
He goes on to say,
"My ex did it."

07:01.087 --> 07:04.123
And then he goes on to say
I did it, on "TMZ."

07:04.190 --> 07:06.592
{\an5}Okay.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.592
Then she comes up
to the press conference

07:06.659 --> 07:07.727
and says that she did it.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.729
Now, y'all mother(bleep)
tell me.

07:09.796 --> 07:10.997
'Cause everybody did it.

07:11.063 --> 07:13.166
I did it, you did it,
she did it, he did it.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.601
{\an5}Everybody did it.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.601
He said all those stories.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.670
{\an4}Right.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.670
All I know is that I
didn't do it.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.238
At the press conference,
Alejandra,

07:19.305 --> 07:23.142
you came up and said you were
responsible for the release

07:23.209 --> 07:24.744
{\an5}of the tape.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.744
{\an1}Because she can't
take responsibility

07:24.811 --> 07:25.945
of her own actions.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.347
{\an1}She file a lawsuit
against someone

07:28.414 --> 07:30.583
{\an1}that she was just
really trying to hurt,

07:30.650 --> 07:33.920
and I was looking at her when
she actually sent that video.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.389
(audience exclaiming)

07:36.455 --> 07:38.457
So you're saying you were with
Teairra when she posted it?

07:38.524 --> 07:40.526
{\an5}It was our home.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.526
What?!

07:40.593 --> 07:43.095
{\an5}(Nina)
She was at your home.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.095
The timing, everything matches.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.897
You're saying that she released
the video in front of you--

07:44.964 --> 07:47.066
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.066
--and you saw her do it.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.268
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.268
{\an5}So why did you say you did it?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.268
You're a (bleep) liar, bitch!

07:49.335 --> 07:50.837
{\an1}Because she can't
take responsibility

07:50.903 --> 07:53.005
{\an4}and I'm not gonna
let him go get hurt--

07:50.903 --> 07:53.005
You're a liar!

07:53.072 --> 07:54.607
{\an1}--about something
that she did.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.442
{\an5}You got your (bleep)
story mixed up.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.442
She wanted to--

07:56.509 --> 07:58.678
Actually Sade had it
more right than you do.

07:58.744 --> 08:03.149
{\an4}What?

07:58.744 --> 08:03.149
She got it more right
than you just did, dodo.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.384
(laughter)

08:05.451 --> 08:07.520
{\an8}You went to a real
press conference--

08:05.451 --> 08:07.520
{\an4}Yeah.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.789
{\an4}--and said you did something
that you didn't do.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.789
{\an1}She did a real
press conference--

08:09.856 --> 08:11.357
{\an5}Wait, you going--

08:09.856 --> 08:11.357
--about her lies--

08:11.424 --> 08:13.092
You a different type
of weak bitch.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.127
Alejandra, are you saying you
would take a charge for him?

08:15.194 --> 08:17.864
{\an1}Yeah.
My loyalty goes for him.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.665
So, Akbar, would you take
a charge for either of them?

08:19.732 --> 08:22.368
Yeah, I'd take a charge
with my people, (bleep).

08:22.435 --> 08:24.270
Well, it doesn't seem
clear to me who released it,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.572
but either way, it sounds like
Alejandra going to jail for it.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.241
{\an5}(laughter)

08:26.639 --> 08:28.241
She would,
she would be willing to.

08:28.307 --> 08:33.479
{\an5}(cheering and applause)

08:28.307 --> 08:33.479
So...

08:33.546 --> 08:35.715
Brooke, I know that you
spoke with him.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.885
What was your initial perception
of Akbar when you met him?

08:38.951 --> 08:40.453
He was a nice guy
showing me.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.554
{\an1}Didn't you tell me
he showed your friend the videos

08:42.621 --> 08:45.324
{\an1}before they were
ever released?

08:45.391 --> 08:46.926
Yeah, but she asked me
about when I met him.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.294
{\an1}But did you or did you not
tell me

08:48.361 --> 08:49.962
{\an1}that he showed your friend
the tapes?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.230
{\an5}This was before.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.230
Yeah, we talked about that,
yeah, we did.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.065
{\an5}Yeah, okay.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.065
You... are you done?

08:53.132 --> 08:54.133
No, I'm not done.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.635
{\an1}You and I
are not on the same level,

08:55.701 --> 08:57.436
{\an1}so you do not
affect me at all.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.605
{\an4}Anything that you say does
not mean anything to me.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.605
Yeah, we're not, baby.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.607
{\an5}You're here and I'm there.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.607
{\an1}I'm glad that we're
giving you life.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.677
{\an5}I just wanna understand why you
said you released the tape.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.677
(voices overlapping)

09:04.744 --> 09:06.178
Go talk to that man.
Go talk to that man.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.346
{\an5}Teairra...

09:06.245 --> 09:07.346
You said that you--

09:07.413 --> 09:08.881
{\an5}Teairra!

09:07.413 --> 09:08.881
(voices overlapping)

09:08.948 --> 09:10.249
...all this (bleep).

09:10.316 --> 09:13.219
because they lying.
I'm out then.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.322
(audience whooping and cheering)

09:16.389 --> 09:18.024
{\an1}Yeah, bitch, when I go,
y'all gotta go too,

09:18.090 --> 09:20.092
'cause you're...
the story's gone.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.161
{\an1}The story's gone, bitch.
Bye.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.829
You won't face the truth.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.198
Bye, have a nice
storyline, bitch.

09:26.265 --> 09:27.967
I already said
what I had to say.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.369
All they doing
is (bleep) lying.

09:30.436 --> 09:31.904
Hang on, Teairra,
hang on, hang on.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.307
{\an5}No, no, no...

09:31.971 --> 09:34.307
I'm gone.

09:34.373 --> 09:36.108
I'm not sharing the stage
with my (bleep)...

09:36.175 --> 09:40.513
this bum and (bleep) trying
to be 15 minutes famous.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.882
{\an5}Like, get outta here.
They need to go.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.882
Shh, shh, shh...

09:42.949 --> 09:45.451
{\an5}It's me or them.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.451
Shh, just calm down, baby.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.552
It's me or them.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.154
{\an7}Your (bleep)
never went in me.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.089
{\an8}That's some fake-ass (bleep).

09:48.220 --> 09:50.089
{\an8}(oohing)

09:50.156 --> 09:52.024

09:52.091 --> 09:53.526
{\an8}(audience exclaiming)

09:53.592 --> 09:57.063
{\an8}Kimberly, you always
seem to be nosy.
Why not ask me?

09:57.129 --> 09:58.531
{\an8}You from Detroit, bitch,
I'm from Memphis.

09:58.597 --> 09:59.598
{\an8}I know we fight!

09:59.665 --> 10:01.400
{\an8}(audience oohing)

10:07.740 --> 10:10.009
{\an8}(music, cheering and applause)

10:10.076 --> 10:13.245
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

10:13.312 --> 10:14.814
Teairra,
I know this is difficult,

10:14.880 --> 10:17.049
so thank you for coming back
and talking about this,

10:17.116 --> 10:19.485
'cause your side is important
and we wanna hear from you.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.221
Just, just to add to this,
we also have Kimberly,

10:22.288 --> 10:24.690
who is gonna be
joining us backstage

10:24.757 --> 10:25.791
since tensions
have been running

10:25.858 --> 10:28.160
a bit high tonight
on the reunion.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.762
Teairra,
let me ask you a question.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.630
When you were in London and you
were having the conversation

10:31.697 --> 10:33.232
and it was revealed
that Kimberly

10:33.299 --> 10:36.202
was speaking to him
on her Instagram Live...

10:36.268 --> 10:37.403
"Do you see me?"

10:37.470 --> 10:39.405
Yeah, I see
your old big-head ass,

10:39.472 --> 10:42.341
old sex-tape-leaking ass.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.543
Were you threatened
by their relationship?

10:44.610 --> 10:47.780
Kimberly, I always have
seen you out in public,

10:47.847 --> 10:50.049
and you've always
seemed to be cordial.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.051
{\an1}I didn't know it was
that serious, Teairra.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.552
{\an1}I don't have no problem
with Akbar.

10:53.619 --> 10:54.954
Akbar is cool.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.889
{\an1}I'm never gonna be
in his team of hoes.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.057
I'm not finna be that.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.625
{\an5}(laughter)

10:58.124 --> 10:59.625
Team of hoes.

10:59.692 --> 11:00.960
No, but I like them too,

11:01.027 --> 11:02.661
{\an1}'cause I wanna sleep
with the chocolate wife.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.664
(audience exclaiming)

11:05.731 --> 11:07.400
{\an1}So if they don't want to,
I would gladly

11:07.466 --> 11:09.235
{\an5}(bleep) her (bleep).

11:07.466 --> 11:09.235
(Nina)
Sade?

11:09.301 --> 11:12.338
That's what I'm saying.
'Cause she is my type.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.807
But you, Teairra, for real,

11:14.874 --> 11:17.276
I always spoke highly
of you, Teairra.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.645
So I ain't trying to put that
on your back.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.547
I don't wanna
put that on your back.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.516
Nah, you don't have to be
on sight with me.

11:23.582 --> 11:24.750
You from Detroit, bitch,
I'm from Memphis.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.686
{\an5}I know we fight.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.686
(laughter)

11:27.753 --> 11:29.221
We crazier
than a mother(bleep),

11:29.288 --> 11:31.023
'cause we real
and we feel what we feel.

11:31.090 --> 11:36.195
So if I offended you for seeing
with him, I am sorry, Teairra.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.097
I don't know what happened.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.598
I'm good.
Thank you for your apology.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.333
(applause)

11:41.400 --> 11:43.636
But if,
if they did that to you,

11:43.702 --> 11:47.073
just know that that (bleep)
is going to come out

11:47.139 --> 11:50.042
{\an5}and they have to live with that
for the rest of their life.

11:47.139 --> 11:50.042
The truth shall prevail.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.746
(whooping and applause)

11:53.813 --> 11:55.147
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.147
So I love y'all.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.249
I'm finna go, I need to get
some edibles, but...

11:57.316 --> 11:59.085
{\an5}Oh, okay.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.085
(laughter)

11:59.151 --> 12:01.320
(Kimberly)
Kumbaya!

12:01.387 --> 12:03.823
(Nina)
So, we're gonna shift gears.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.224
As the world turned this season,

12:05.291 --> 12:07.093
the cast was more
young and restless than ever,

12:07.159 --> 12:11.230
with bitter betrayals, love
triangles and feuding divas.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.632
But it was the bold and
the beautiful Brooke Valentine

12:13.699 --> 12:17.470
who stole the show with her
classic soap opera villain m.o.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.106
{\an8}Messy Brooke!

12:17.536 --> 12:20.106
{\an8}I'm just saying, (bleep)!

12:20.172 --> 12:22.208
{\an8}(Marcus)
Crazy Valentine strikes again.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.076
{\an8}I got a plan in mind.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.277
{\an8}Oh, (bleep).

12:25.344 --> 12:26.612
{\an8}What the (bleep)
are you doing here?

12:26.679 --> 12:29.615
{\an8}(humming wedding march)

12:29.682 --> 12:31.083
{\an8}Brooke, this ain't the time.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.085
{\an8}You're outta your mind.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.085
{\an7}So what?

12:33.152 --> 12:34.153
{\an8}You was
Teairra's understudy--

12:34.220 --> 12:35.621
{\an7}Oh...

12:34.220 --> 12:35.621
{\an8}--and now you're studying

12:35.688 --> 12:37.690
{\an8}to be my understudy,
and I don't need one.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.690
{\an4}Oh...

12:37.756 --> 12:43.762
{\an8}Never have I ever...
had sex with Solo Lucci.

12:37.756 --> 12:43.762
{\an5}Ooh...

12:43.829 --> 12:45.598
{\an8}(Nikki)
Why you giving me a look
like that, bitch?

12:45.664 --> 12:48.501
{\an8}Never have I ever had sex
with Solo Lucci either.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.035
{\an8}Oh, that's not what I heard.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.038
{\an8}Listen...

12:50.102 --> 12:53.038
{\an7}Break up with him before he
break up with you!

12:53.105 --> 12:54.406
{\an8}Advice. Advice.

12:54.473 --> 12:56.275
(laughter and applause)

12:56.342 --> 12:57.710
(Nina)
All right.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.145
I'm stressed out, Nina.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.247
I, I know,
but we're calling you messy.

13:01.313 --> 13:04.850
Is there anything this season
that you do regret?

13:04.917 --> 13:07.520
My biggest regrets were
if I hurt anyone's feelings,

13:07.586 --> 13:09.321
'cause that wasn't
my intentions.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.890
{\an5}I'm not that type of person.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.890
{\an1}Sometimes when you're trying
to be helpful...

13:10.956 --> 13:12.825
{\an5}I'm a truth serum type of girl--

13:10.956 --> 13:12.825
Okay.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.894
--and sometimes that's not
always the best thing.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.495
{\an5}(laughter)

13:14.960 --> 13:16.495
But, in my defense,

13:16.562 --> 13:18.931
a lot of people's business
came to me.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.366
Why did you insert yourself

13:20.432 --> 13:23.102
with what was going on
with her and Akbar?

13:23.169 --> 13:24.236
{\an1}I shared information
with her

13:24.303 --> 13:26.071
that I thought
she already knew.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.541
Don't be messy with my (bleep)
if you're a friend.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.009
{\an5}(Bridget)
But in Brooke's defense,
when we were all in London

13:30.075 --> 13:32.311
{\an1}and we all had that
conversation on that couch,

13:32.378 --> 13:34.413
{\an1}we all sat there and we all
watched that footage

13:34.480 --> 13:37.283
{\an4}of Kimberly on with Akbar
and we all...

13:34.480 --> 13:37.283
And everybody had my back.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.450
{\an5}Everybody had your back.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.450
We did.

13:38.517 --> 13:39.752
{\an1}But we didn't
just have your back.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.921
{\an1}We were willing
to go to war with Kimberly

13:41.987 --> 13:43.422
about the Akbar situation

13:43.489 --> 13:45.024
{\an1}and we didn't have
all the information.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.259
{\an1}So I understand what you're
saying about being messy,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.695
{\an1}but at the same time,
whether you asked us to or not,

13:49.762 --> 13:52.331
{\an4}we were willing
to go to bat for you.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.331
Let's move on from Akbar.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.500
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.500
Yeah, 'cause I'm sick
of talking about, uh...

13:54.567 --> 13:55.834
(Nina)
We'll move on.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.036
When you guys were in London,

13:57.102 --> 13:58.504
'cause we were talking
about London,

13:58.571 --> 13:59.738
you guys were playing
the "Never Have I Ever" game.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.607
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.607
Why did you

14:01.674 --> 14:04.043
make the comment,
sliding Nikki to say

14:04.109 --> 14:06.946
"Never have I ever slept
with Solo Lucci"?

14:07.012 --> 14:09.415
{\an5}(Brooke)
It was a catty moment
between Nikki and I.

14:09.481 --> 14:10.616
{\an5}Okay.

14:09.481 --> 14:10.616
If you watched it, she said,

14:10.683 --> 14:11.951
"Never have I ever
had a threesome,"

14:12.017 --> 14:14.119
and it was
a little moment where...

14:14.186 --> 14:16.589
{\an5}It got deep-deep.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.589
...some people alluded to me

14:16.655 --> 14:18.390
{\an5}being the one
that had a threesome.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.390
Okay.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.660
So I took it personal and then
I threw a jab back.

14:21.727 --> 14:23.062
Unless you physically
see somebody (bleep) me,

14:23.128 --> 14:25.097
don't speak to me about
my (bleep), number one.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.832
{\an4}And then, like, we're gonna
keep it all the way straight?

14:25.164 --> 14:26.832
(Nina)
Okay.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.434
Teairra was with me
the night he tried to say

14:28.500 --> 14:30.469
{\an1}that this fake-ass threesome
(bleep) happened.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.638
{\an5}(audience oohing)

14:30.536 --> 14:32.638
We ain't talking
about no threesome.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.940
{\an4}Like, Teairra was not
in this situation--

14:32.705 --> 14:34.940
We ain't saying
nothing about that.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.342
{\an1}--which is fine.
That's some fake-ass (bleep).

14:36.408 --> 14:37.710
{\an1}Your (bleep)
never went in me.

14:37.776 --> 14:40.512
{\an5}That's some fake-ass (bleep).

14:37.776 --> 14:40.512
Man, you a (bleep) liar.

14:40.579 --> 14:43.148
{\an5}I (bleep) with you
on multiple occasions.

14:40.579 --> 14:43.148
Teairra, did his
(bleep) go in me?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.017
This ain't no good,
I... come on, Nikki.

14:45.084 --> 14:49.722
{\an4}You were there with me
that night.

14:45.084 --> 14:49.722
Not that I know of,
I said, bitch.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.890
{\an5}Thank you.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.890
{\an5}(laughter)

14:49.788 --> 14:51.890
(Nina)
Okay.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.092
Titi, you've grown so much.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.593
{\an1}You not finna sit here
and lie like that.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.661
Teairra,
what are you saying?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.263
{\an5}You was there.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.263
What happened?

14:57.329 --> 14:59.231
{\an1}And you not finna sit here
and lie like that.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.301
{\an5}If you want me to keep it
silent, keep it silent too.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.301
That's my (bleep) point.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.804
{\an5}I didn't see no (bleep)
in no (bleep), so I'm
not gonna speak on sis.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.940
Are we playing in semantics?
Are you guys saying that...?

15:08.007 --> 15:10.142
{\an4}That's what I'm saying.
Nina! Nina!

15:08.007 --> 15:10.142
You're saying no.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.777
{\an1}What I'm telling
you is... look at me.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.114
{\an4}I understand.
I'd want to (bleep) me too.
I totally get it, okay?

15:15.180 --> 15:17.349
{\an5}I'm a fine-ass bitch.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.349
(laughter)

15:17.416 --> 15:20.819
{\an4}At the end of the day,
Nikki gonna still
(bleep) with me.

15:20.886 --> 15:24.256
No, I'm not. I've never
talked to you since then.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.325
Nikki, you were just at my
house, like, two weeks ago.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.494
(cheering)

15:28.560 --> 15:31.563
{\an4}Teairra was there with me.
She knows what's up.
I'm serious.

15:31.630 --> 15:35.167
{\an5}So we not about to sit
here and do all this.

15:31.630 --> 15:35.167
All right. All right, guys.
We're moving on.

15:35.234 --> 15:38.337
Well, listen, after throwing
a chocolate surprise as bait,

15:38.404 --> 15:42.841
{\an5}Brooke and Bridget had
Amber Diamond on the hook
for a catfishing surprise,

15:42.908 --> 15:46.712
{\an5}but it was Bridget who
ended up catching a wig.
Let's check it out.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.481
{\an8}Did you come here for
your chocolate surprise?

15:49.548 --> 15:51.984
{\an8}I was invited by Marcus.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.984
{\an9}Marcus!

15:52.051 --> 15:54.486
{\an7}Yeah.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.486
{\an8}No, I'm Marcus.

15:54.553 --> 15:58.557
{\an8}I was texting you
from his phone.
Gotcha! (laughs)

15:58.624 --> 16:02.594
{\an7}'Cause I knew that you were
honorary side chick. I knew
that you were thirsty.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.930
{\an8}Sing! I want to see you
sing and dance, puppet!

16:04.997 --> 16:06.732
{\an8}No, no, no, she don't
have to perform for y'all.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.667
{\an8}She's a puppet.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.667
{\an8}Stop talking to them.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.936
{\an7}Oh!

16:08.734 --> 16:10.936
{\an8}Oh! Wait a minute!

16:11.003 --> 16:13.138
{\an8}Why you come at me,
bitch? I ain't got
nothing to do with you.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.741
{\an8}Girl, why the (bleep)
are we doing (bleep)?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.377
{\an8}Nobody was even
coming for you, Mom!

16:18.444 --> 16:20.646
(cheering)

16:20.713 --> 16:24.283
{\an4}You needed, like,
a snap-off tutu 'cause
that had you caught up.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.086
{\an5}Before Nina asks any
questions, I just
want to ask Amber,

16:27.152 --> 16:29.655
{\an5}is your wig
secure today?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.655
(laughter)

16:29.722 --> 16:33.058
{\an5}It's secure today. It is
tacked. It's on. My man
touching it. It's on.

16:33.125 --> 16:38.263
{\an4}Look, I promise you,
I knew her wig was loose
and I knew mine wasn't.

16:38.330 --> 16:42.101
{\an4}I didn't have nothin' else.
I couldn't get my shoe
'cause my ass is old,

16:42.167 --> 16:44.269
{\an1}so this bitch wig was loose.
I knew it was,

16:44.336 --> 16:46.372
{\an1}so I just wanted to
shut her up for a minute.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.608
{\an4}At the end of the day
for me, I was more
shocked and surprised

16:49.675 --> 16:51.944
{\an1}because I really was
trying to be diplomatic.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.213
(overlapping chatter)

16:54.279 --> 16:57.816
{\an4}You see these (bleep) guns?
I'da punched her like that.
I wasn't gonna do that.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.119
{\an5}Okay.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.119
{\an1}'Cause that'd hurt her, so I
just hit her with the damn wig.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.621
{\an1}It would have been fine.
I wasn't trying to fight y'all.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.525
{\an5}Looking back now, are
you happy about how the
catfish scheme turned out?

17:06.592 --> 17:09.094
{\an5}That was fun.
It was big fun, okay?

17:06.592 --> 17:09.094
(laughter)

17:09.161 --> 17:12.231
{\an5}Chocolate surprise was
big fun. Come with no
panties on was big fun.

17:12.297 --> 17:15.267
{\an5}What that mouth do
was big fun, okay?

17:12.297 --> 17:15.267
(applause)

17:15.334 --> 17:18.069
{\an5}When Amber showed up
with her ho mama, it
was a whole situation.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.940
{\an5}It was, but it was petty.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.940
{\an5}How you gonna say it was
petty for us to play a
game when her and Marcus

17:22.007 --> 17:23.742
{\an5}shouldn't have been
communicating
in the first place?

17:23.809 --> 17:27.813
{\an4}Why are we not interrogating
the (bleep) out of Marcus
before we texting her?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.482
{\an5}Has Marcus not been
interrogated enough?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.482
Okay.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.518
{\an1}No, Marcus ain't been
interrogated enough

17:32.584 --> 17:36.555
{\an4}because you still got
an innocent woman showing
up looking for your ass.

17:32.584 --> 17:36.555
(applause)

17:36.622 --> 17:39.758
{\an5}Me and Marcus been cool
for some years. Been
there, done that.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.528
{\an5}If I wanted him,
I could have had him.
I didn't pursue it.

17:42.594 --> 17:46.365
{\an4}Looking at somebody and
actually having a connection
to somebody is different.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.800
{\an1}Out in the ghettos,
there's nothing there.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.002
{\an1}If she went her way,
I went mine, it was cool.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.371
{\an5}It wasn't in a while.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.371
Okay, let's move on.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.940
Coming up, we dive into
a pop-up wedding

17:55.007 --> 17:57.643
but it doesn't take long
for someone to object.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.978
More "Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"
when the reunion returns.

18:00.045 --> 18:03.882
(cheers and applause)

18:03.949 --> 18:06.418
{\an7}And I'll let y'all in
on a little secret.

18:03.949 --> 18:06.418
{\an5}Okay.

18:06.485 --> 18:07.953
{\an8}(audience ohing)

18:08.020 --> 18:10.622
{\an7}It kind of looked a little bit
like the Akbar situation.

{\an8}(cheers and applause)

18:31.610 --> 18:34.746
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

18:34.813 --> 18:39.017
{\an5}Marcus took full advantage
of Brooke's orders to go
sow his royal oats,

18:39.084 --> 18:42.254
{\an5}but when it looked like
Farmer Marcus may be
a little too fertile,

18:42.321 --> 18:47.292
{\an5}Brooke stepped in and let Stasia
know she had to E-I-E-I-go.
Let's take a look.

18:47.359 --> 18:50.996
{\an5}And I see that ring finger
shining brighter than
all the others.

18:47.359 --> 18:50.996
{\an1}Oh, hello!

18:51.063 --> 18:52.331
{\an1}Thank you.

With who?

18:52.397 --> 18:54.900
{\an8}Marcus. I know,
fair question.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.900
{\an8}Marcus Black?

18:54.967 --> 18:59.104
{\an7}Yeah, we're engaged.
Marcus may not know it yet,
but we're getting married.

18:59.171 --> 19:06.078
{\an8}Like, how... how would
you feel if, basically,
if I was pregnant?

19:06.144 --> 19:08.847
{\an8}Marcus called her up,
she spread 'em wide,

19:08.914 --> 19:11.517
{\an8}you a little horny.
Cool. Are we done?

19:11.583 --> 19:17.823
{\an7}I'm wearing the ring
you bought me. I'm ready.
Get rid of your bimbo Barbie.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.893
{\an8}You say you want this,
but you're not willing
to do nothin' for it.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.996
{\an8}If you don't prove
that this is something
that's solid for me

19:24.062 --> 19:26.965
{\an8}and it's gonna be there,
I don't want it.

19:27.032 --> 19:30.035
{\an1}Hey, am I gonna be
a sexy stepmama or what?

19:30.102 --> 19:32.304
{\an5}Ain't no baby.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.304
{\an1}Oh, really?
So you're not pregnant?

19:32.371 --> 19:37.175
{\an9}No.

19:32.371 --> 19:37.175
{\an7}Okay. Let's just use
this as a learning
experience, girl.

19:37.242 --> 19:40.312
{\an7}Maybe you could use
a few of those.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.581
{\an9}(bleep)!

19:40.379 --> 19:42.581
{\an7}It's just advice.
No, no, I'm not even...

19:42.648 --> 19:44.182
{\an8}Like, I'm so (bleep)
tired of you.

19:44.249 --> 19:47.252

it had to end in front
of the free clinic.

Welcome to our wedding.

{\an8}Are you ready to do this?

19:52.457 --> 19:54.359
{\an9}To do what?

19:54.426 --> 19:57.429
{\an8}Get married.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.429
{\an8}Brooke, this is not...
This ain't what we...

19:57.496 --> 19:59.831
{\an8}This is not what
we had in mind.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.831
{\an7}So what?

19:59.898 --> 20:04.570
{\an8}Today, I don't want to
celebrate our marriage.

20:04.636 --> 20:08.073
{\an1}I'd like to celebrate
our engagement.

20:08.140 --> 20:11.176
If it's not too much for me,
would you mind being my wife?

20:11.243 --> 20:15.581
Oh, my goodness, yes.
Oh, my goodness.

20:15.647 --> 20:17.683
{\an8}Do that! Do that, Marcus!

20:15.647 --> 20:17.683
{\an8}Okay.

20:17.749 --> 20:20.385
{\an5}We've had an interesting
approach to this
relationship all season.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.955
{\an8}It was crazy as (bleep).

20:20.452 --> 20:22.955
{\an8}What do you think
about how she...?

20:23.021 --> 20:24.823
{\an5}The whole thing was
crazy as (bleep).

20:23.021 --> 20:24.823
Okay.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.993
{\an5}Brooke, let's talk about
the wedding. Now, why
trick him into a wedding?

20:28.060 --> 20:31.897
{\an8}I felt like it was just
too much in between going
on between him and I,

20:31.964 --> 20:35.200
{\an8}and when that happens,
he's idle, and he end up
at the free clinic.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.804
{\an5}(laughter)

20:35.267 --> 20:38.804
So why were you wearing
the ring before the proposal?

20:38.870 --> 20:41.273
{\an4}'Cause Marcus not gonna
play with me, Nina.
He even came to Houston

20:41.340 --> 20:43.775
{\an4}with the ring, showing it
to my mama. You're not
gonna keep playing with me.

20:43.842 --> 20:47.546
{\an5}Yes, we have issues,
and I'll let y'all in
on a little secret.

20:43.842 --> 20:47.546
Okay.

20:47.613 --> 20:52.451
{\an7}My past relationship with my ex,
it kind of looked a little bit
like the Akbar situation.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.720
{\an8}(laughter)

20:52.517 --> 20:54.720
{\an8}She was with Alejandra.

20:54.786 --> 20:58.690
{\an5}(laughter)

20:54.786 --> 20:58.690
{\an4}We were rich. I didn't
want nothing. A lot of
people asked me,

20:58.757 --> 21:03.028
{\an5}how were you able to love
Marcus and let him sow his
oats and stuff like that.

20:58.757 --> 21:03.028
Right, right.

21:03.095 --> 21:07.833
{\an4}And a lot of that came
from me needing to deal
with my way of thinking.

21:03.095 --> 21:07.833
Okay.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.301
{\an5}You had a different
way of thinking.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.301
Yeah, I did,

21:09.368 --> 21:11.503
and I knew I wasn't
giving Marcus none.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.039
{\an5}He a man with
a thang-thang,
a big thang.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.807
{\an4}That's none of
y'all business.
So in my mind...

21:15.874 --> 21:17.676
(laughter)

21:17.743 --> 21:20.846
All right, well, let's
move on a little bit.

21:20.912 --> 21:24.983
{\an5}After a pin was dropped
by Paris, Booby rolled up
on the Bentley vow renewal

21:25.050 --> 21:27.853
to confront Marcus over
his engagement with Brooke.

21:27.919 --> 21:31.456
Let's see how the battle
of the Brooke baes went down.

21:33.525 --> 21:36.161
{\an5}What's going on?

21:33.525 --> 21:36.161
I don't know you, you
don't know me, right?

21:36.228 --> 21:38.730
{\an8}You done heard all type
of (bleep), but I'm here
right now, (bleep),

21:38.797 --> 21:41.600
{\an7}to holla at you about
moving forward with somebody
that I care about.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.969
{\an8}She don't got no father.
She don't got no brother.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.773
{\an8}She don't got nobody to
make sure she's cool, and
you out here on (bleep).

21:47.839 --> 21:51.610
{\an8}You out here on (bleep).

21:47.839 --> 21:51.610
{\an7}Ain't nobody ever around.
You ain't never there.

21:51.677 --> 21:54.946
{\an7}(bleep), I'm there.
I watch the kids. I pay
the mother(bleep) bills.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.581
What bills
you payin', (bleep)?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.050
All of 'em, all of 'em.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.218
{\an8}End of the day, she gonna
(bleep) with this (bleep),

22:00.285 --> 22:03.021
{\an8}they gonna have (bleep)
babies, and they gonna
be lame forever, though.

22:03.088 --> 22:06.958
{\an8}It ain't no point in us
having no conversation.
What's up, my (bleep)?

22:07.025 --> 22:10.195
{\an8}That's all fake, bro.

22:07.025 --> 22:10.195
{\an8}Let me go, fam!

22:10.262 --> 22:12.230
{\an9}This cute.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.230
{\an8}Listen, I'm easy to find.

22:12.297 --> 22:14.633
{\an8}I'll find you.

22:12.297 --> 22:14.633
{\an7}We gonna slap the (bleep)
out your whole ass.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.902
{\an8}See you in a minute.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.902
{\an8}On my soul!

22:16.968 --> 22:19.905
(audience ohing)

22:19.971 --> 22:24.576
{\an5}I guess I deserved that.
Messy Brooke deserved
that, huh? Pin-drop Paris.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.344
You wanted to drop the pin
and just kind of...

22:26.411 --> 22:29.815
{\an5}I had drop the pin.
I had to. Booby
is like fam.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.651
{\an5}I'm cool with Marcus.
She would have did it
to me too.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.619
Were you mad at Brooke
that he popped up?

22:34.686 --> 22:38.824
{\an4}Nah. I mean, you know,
I ain't really blame
that on nobody.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.560
{\an5}Okay.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.560
{\an5}You know what I'm saying?
This was Lyrica and A1
vow renewal,

22:41.626 --> 22:44.930
{\an5}so I didn't know what he was
coming for. I didn't even know
how he got there, honestly.

22:44.996 --> 22:48.767
{\an4}I didn't know who dropped
the pin 'til later. I don't
really know Buddy like that,

22:48.834 --> 22:52.838
{\an4}so I can't really see
no reason for us to be
doing too much talking.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.640
Marcus, are you okay that Paris
dropped the pin at that time

22:55.707 --> 22:58.176
{\an5}or did you have
a problem with that?

22:55.707 --> 22:58.176
He don't care about that.

22:58.243 --> 23:01.446
{\an5}I ain't have no problem with
nobody doing whatever they like
they feel like they gotta do.

23:01.513 --> 23:04.316
{\an4}Ain't nobody question me
about nothin' I got to
do with mine, period.

23:04.382 --> 23:07.686
{\an1}That's my woman.
That's the end of that.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.354
(applause)

23:09.421 --> 23:11.123
{\an5}It felt like Booby wanted
more than a friendship.

23:09.421 --> 23:11.123
Okay.

23:11.189 --> 23:15.227
{\an5}Like, I was trying to
keep a friendship, and
Booby wanted more.

23:15.293 --> 23:19.965
{\an5}Booby made the comment that
Marcus keeps you in a prison.

23:15.293 --> 23:19.965
In a prison.
I heard that.

23:20.031 --> 23:23.201
{\an5}And you can't talk to him
because you're scared.

23:20.031 --> 23:23.201
Does it look like I've
been in a prison, y'all?

23:23.268 --> 23:25.804
{\an5}I've been running around
doing and saying
whatever I want.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.974
{\an4}I wish he would.
Maybe I wouldn't be
in so much drama, okay?

23:25.871 --> 23:28.974
You don't feel like that at all.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.676
{\an5}Marcus, can you lock me up?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.676
Nah, not a chance.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.945
To Booby's defense, what
he told me, he feels like

23:34.012 --> 23:37.783
{\an5}when you go through stuff
with Marcus, you call him
and you tell him.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.786
{\an5}That's not necessarily
true. Booby will hear
about something,

23:40.852 --> 23:44.156
{\an5}like he did, and he'll
call me, upset that
I didn't call him

23:44.222 --> 23:46.391
{\an5}and talk to him about
it, and I said, you
gotta understand

23:46.458 --> 23:49.327
{\an5}the sensitivity
of this situation.

23:46.458 --> 23:49.327
He was the one who told me
y'all was engaged.

23:49.394 --> 23:51.930
I think if anybody was
in my shoes, I don't think

23:51.997 --> 23:55.567
{\an4}that Booby would be the
person that they'd call
to vent to about Marcus, okay?

23:55.634 --> 23:58.170
{\an5}That (bleep)'s
not gonna happen.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.170
Do you think Booby popped up

23:58.236 --> 24:01.072
{\an5}because he's still in
love with Brooke or has
feelings for Brooke?

24:01.139 --> 24:03.441
I honestly could care less
what his intentions were.

24:03.508 --> 24:06.912
{\an4}He was clearly out of
his jurisdiction. This my
side of the fence, player.

24:06.978 --> 24:09.581
(applause)

24:09.648 --> 24:12.784
{\an5}All right, well, Brooke
and Marcus, we wish
you guys the best

24:12.851 --> 24:14.853
and we still got
a whole lot of show left.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.889
{\an5}Coming up, a one-on-one
conversation with
Kimberly and Paris

24:17.956 --> 24:22.060
{\an5}where we hope to resolve
the issue that has plagued
them all season long.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.763
This is "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

{\an8}I raised her.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.168
{\an8}You raised me, sis?

24:30.235 --> 24:32.003
{\an8}I found you on...

24:30.235 --> 24:32.003
{\an8}She's a (bleep)!

24:32.070 --> 24:33.672
{\an8}You-- I was...

24:32.070 --> 24:33.672
{\an8}She was a fan on (bleep)!

24:57.362 --> 25:00.298
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

25:00.365 --> 25:03.335
{\an5}Now, you guys may have
noticed that the stage
is a little empty,

25:03.401 --> 25:06.738
{\an5}but that's because we
wanted to make things private
with Kimberly and Paris

25:06.805 --> 25:10.609
and give them space to
hash things out one-on-one.

25:10.675 --> 25:14.479
{\an5}Kimberly arrived in Hollywood
ready to put her implant
issues behind her,

25:14.546 --> 25:18.550
{\an5}but it was her dealings with
Paris that ended up being
the real pain in her ass.

25:18.617 --> 25:23.588
{\an8}My name is Kimberly, the artist
formerly known as K. Michelle,

25:23.655 --> 25:27.125
{\an8}and I'm bringing the real
to Lala-land.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.694
Hollywood ain't ready
for this (bleep). (laughs)

25:29.761 --> 25:32.864
{\an8}What's the tea?

25:29.761 --> 25:32.864
{\an7}She's sweet
but she got her side,

25:32.931 --> 25:35.901
{\an8}a side you will
find out about.

25:32.931 --> 25:35.901
{\an9}Uh-oh.

25:35.967 --> 25:40.038
{\an7}We fell out because she
told the world that
I stole her credit cards.

25:40.105 --> 25:43.675
{\an7}You cannot keep making
excuses for what happened.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.777
{\an8}It was an Uber ride.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.777
{\an7}So you didn't
use any of my...?

25:45.844 --> 25:49.381
{\an7}This was almost $300!
This is the proof!
This is everything!

25:49.447 --> 25:51.650
{\an7}We're done.
I don't want to see you.

25:51.716 --> 25:55.654
{\an8}I am tired of you!
I'm tired of you, bitch!
You gonna do me like that?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.789
{\an8}You got me (bleep) up!

25:55.720 --> 25:57.789
{\an8}You're a thief!

25:57.856 --> 26:02.193
{\an8}(audience ohing)

26:02.260 --> 26:03.929
This incident that we just saw
with the drink throwing,

26:03.995 --> 26:07.966
you tweeted that you were
going to be pressing charges.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.734
{\an5}Is that still the case?

26:08.033 --> 26:09.734
{\an1}Yes.

26:09.801 --> 26:13.004
Paris, did you know that she was
going to be pressing charges?

26:13.071 --> 26:15.707
{\an7}The bitches I know from
Memphis, they don't call cops
and do stuff like that.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.109
{\an7}Well, the bitches I know
don't steal.

26:18.176 --> 26:21.880
{\an4}You're not gonna hit me
and steal from me and think
I'm not gonna press charges.

26:21.947 --> 26:24.282
{\an1}I'm gonna handle you
in the proper way.

26:24.349 --> 26:27.819
{\an4}I done been hit with
a drink several times
and had my wig yanked off.

26:27.886 --> 26:30.021
{\an4}I ain't never
pressed charges.

26:27.886 --> 26:30.021
She's the queen of doing it.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.324
{\an4}But one thing I ain't,
I ain't no punk.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.324
{\an3}Okay.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.692
{\an5}You do know, Miss Nina...

26:32.390 --> 26:33.692
Okay.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.861
{\an1}I just got out of
the hospital two days.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.097
{\an1}Prior to that,
I was 105 pounds.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.666
{\an4}Prior to me doing that
scene with her, she was
doing the Shiggy challenge.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.268
(laughter)

26:43.335 --> 26:46.571
{\an5}I was in the hospital.

26:43.335 --> 26:46.571
You're saying you were
in the hospital

26:46.638 --> 26:47.872
and you weren't prepared
for a physical altercation.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.675
{\an1}Yeah, I didn't come
to her with that (bleep).

26:50.742 --> 26:52.143
You were looking like
you wanted to get physical.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.145
{\an4}I didn't.
For what?

26:52.210 --> 26:54.145
You didn't. Okay.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.715
{\an5}I raised her.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.715
You raised me, sis?

26:56.781 --> 26:58.149
{\an5}I found you on Twitter!

26:56.781 --> 26:58.149
She's a joke!

26:58.216 --> 27:00.452
{\an5}You-- I was...

26:58.216 --> 27:00.452
She was a fan on Twitter!

27:00.518 --> 27:03.154
{\an5}Yo, she's a liar!

27:00.518 --> 27:03.154
{\an1}She never worked
for anybody.

27:03.221 --> 27:04.856
{\an5}She never had a job.

27:03.221 --> 27:04.856
Let me-- Let me--

27:04.923 --> 27:06.992
{\an1}On top of that,
I paid every bill.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.461
{\an5}I paid your rent.
You lived with me.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.461
Let me let her respond.

27:09.527 --> 27:14.265
{\an4}I could have wrote
you off on my taxes.

27:09.527 --> 27:14.265
Okay. Really, sis?

27:14.332 --> 27:17.602
{\an1}I would have given you
the world 'cause I loved you!

27:17.669 --> 27:21.239
{\an5}But you're a liar!
When you finish, I'ma
go-- I'ma let her go,

27:21.306 --> 27:22.941
{\an5}and I'm gonna tell
y'all what happened.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.941
Okay.

27:23.008 --> 27:24.843
{\an5}Did you not use
the credit card?

27:23.008 --> 27:24.843
Can I speak?

27:24.909 --> 27:27.045
{\an4}It's nothing
to talk about!

27:24.909 --> 27:27.045
Okay, I'm gonna
let her respond.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.813
{\an5}Okay, one at a time.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.813
{\an1}It's nothing
to talk about.

27:28.880 --> 27:32.150
{\an5}Oh!

27:28.880 --> 27:32.150
{\an1}You used the credit card.
I don't got (bleep) to say.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.119
{\an5}Come back! Come back!

27:32.217 --> 27:34.119
She don't want me
to tell the story.

27:34.185 --> 27:37.589
(overlapping shouting)

27:37.655 --> 27:38.723
You hefty-ass thief!

27:38.790 --> 27:41.593
(overlapping shouting)

27:41.659 --> 27:45.030
{\an1}And that same way you
gonna drop drama? Drop, K.!

27:45.096 --> 27:47.098
{\an4}(Nina)
It looks like
Kimberly has left.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.333
{\an5}(Paris)
Because what she
gonna do?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.701
{\an1}I hope she comes back.
I want you guys to talk.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.069
She don't want me to
tell my side of the story.

27:51.136 --> 27:52.604
{\an5}That's why she's
getting up and
running and yelling.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.639
{\an4}Let's talk about your
side since you weren't
able to respond.

27:54.706 --> 27:56.574
{\an5}The reason why I
threw the drink...

27:54.706 --> 27:56.574
{\an1}Yeah.

27:56.641 --> 27:59.044
{\an5}...and I'm mad at myself
for throwing the drink
is that she took me there.

27:59.110 --> 28:02.247
{\an5}That was like my best
friend. Any other time
K. had surgeries,

28:02.313 --> 28:05.116
{\an5}I was there for her.
Ask anybody. I knew
her PIN number.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.684
I knew everything,
so if I really

28:06.751 --> 28:08.420
wanted to rob her,
I could have.

28:08.486 --> 28:12.223
You were a fan on Twitter.
I've done everything for you.

28:12.290 --> 28:15.860
{\an5}You took my credit card
and you used it and you
hit me in my face

28:15.927 --> 28:18.730
when I was my sickest.
I'm done.

28:18.797 --> 28:22.200
What we saw on the show
is that she got a bill

28:22.267 --> 28:26.004
{\an4}and she said that there
were words with "fraud"
written across it.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.273
This paper she got right
now, this is all new.

28:28.339 --> 28:30.108
When me and K. Michelle
got back cool,

28:30.175 --> 28:31.910
she should have said,
P, it was more than $50.

28:31.976 --> 28:33.578
{\an4}But she never
presented you with--

28:31.976 --> 28:33.578
{\an3}Never!

28:33.645 --> 28:36.481
{\an5}That's what's making me
mad. Like, it was $50.

28:33.645 --> 28:36.481
{\an1}Okay.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.450
{\an4}Okay.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.450
For three years,
it's been $50.

28:38.516 --> 28:42.353
{\an5}So now today, for
whatever she got going,
it's $300 now.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.557
Kimberly was up there now,
so this is K. Michelle

28:45.623 --> 28:49.027
{\an5}because I got to deal
with thievin' ass,
hungry ass bitches.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.663
{\an5}If you needed a hamburger,
all you had to do was ask,
bitch,

28:51.729 --> 28:54.666
'cause I would have bought you
the two cheeseburger meal.

28:54.732 --> 28:56.734
{\an1}When you've tried to pay her,
what's happened?

28:56.801 --> 28:58.236
She don't want--
It's not about money.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.505
{\an5}She's trying to ruin me,
but that's not working.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.505
{\an1}Okay.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.174
{\an1}But you did say on the show,
I shouldn't have hit the button,

29:03.241 --> 29:06.077
{\an4}so you do feel that
you shouldn't have
used Uber, ultimately.

29:06.144 --> 29:09.214
{\an5}Yeah, I regret using it.
I thought we was
best friends.

29:09.280 --> 29:13.151
{\an4}That needed to happen,
'cause I got to see who the
(bleep) she was as a person.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.053
So it's like I'm mad at
me for using the Uber,

29:15.120 --> 29:17.655
but then I got to see
how she gave it up.

29:17.722 --> 29:20.725
{\an5}There's no way.
We done cried together.
We done fought together.

29:20.792 --> 29:23.561
{\an5}Like, you gonna do me
like that?

29:20.792 --> 29:23.561
I wish we could resolve more.

29:23.628 --> 29:26.531
{\an5}Unfortunately, K. has
left, so maybe we can
try to talk to her

29:26.598 --> 29:28.199
and get this to happen,
but for now,

29:28.266 --> 29:30.835
{\an4}thank you, Paris, for sharing
your side of the story.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.835
{\an3}Thank you.

29:30.902 --> 29:33.805
And maybe we can get Kimberly
to join us later in the show.

29:33.872 --> 29:36.374
{\an1}So, we're gonna shift gears.
Being in the family way

29:36.441 --> 29:41.412
{\an5}didn't give expectant mother
Princess a reprieve from
family drama with the Norwoods,

29:41.479 --> 29:44.449
but it was another long-time
beef that almost went too far

29:44.516 --> 29:47.585
{\an5}when Princess was ready
to give Moniece those
pregnant "paws."

29:47.652 --> 29:49.454
Let's take a look.

29:49.521 --> 29:54.425
{\an5}What happened?

29:49.521 --> 29:54.425
{\an4}Moniece is going around
saying that Brandy
is my surrogate.

29:54.492 --> 29:57.061
{\an9}What?

29:54.492 --> 29:57.061
{\an7}If you guys
ever see Moniece,

29:57.128 --> 30:00.131
{\an8}I need you guys to drop that
pin and I'm gonna be there.

30:00.198 --> 30:03.434
{\an7}What type of person
announces to the world

30:03.501 --> 30:06.771
{\an7}that someone else is carrying
somebody else's baby?

30:06.838 --> 30:09.841
{\an7}If we have a problem, we can
revisit this conversation

30:09.908 --> 30:12.510
{\an7}in about two and a half months
when I have my baby.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.612
{\an7}Be blessed, everyone.
Have a great day.

30:14.679 --> 30:17.048
{\an8}Come see me when you drop
that demon seed, bitch!

30:17.115 --> 30:19.884
{\an7}Maybe I'll show you how
to be a good mother, too.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.987
{\an7}Bye!

30:19.951 --> 30:22.987
{\an8}Moniece, Moniece,
Moniece, Moniece!

30:23.054 --> 30:24.155
{\an8}Moniece!
Moniece!

30:24.222 --> 30:26.357
{\an8}Bitch, listen!

30:24.222 --> 30:26.357
{\an8}You're a mother(bleep)!

30:26.424 --> 30:28.526
{\an5}You said square off,
right? So, what's up?

30:26.424 --> 30:28.526
{\an3}I'm here.

30:28.593 --> 30:29.894
I never make
the first move.

30:33.097 --> 30:34.732
At this point--
At this point--

30:34.799 --> 30:38.736
At this point,
throws hands!

30:38.803 --> 30:41.072
{\an8}Okay, I'm not doing this.
This is so dumb.

30:41.139 --> 30:42.440
You felt that, huh, bitch?

30:42.507 --> 30:47.111
{\an8}(audience chatter)

30:47.178 --> 30:50.815
So Paris has left the stage but
Kimberly is back with us now.

30:50.882 --> 30:55.119
{\an5}The producers thought it
would be best just keeping
them apart for the time being.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.288
{\an1}K. Michelle's
not stopping my life.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.657
{\an1}She can't stop what God
has planned for me.

30:59.724 --> 31:02.794
After I give you this 300,
leave me the (bleep) alone!

31:02.860 --> 31:06.497
{\an5}There's a lot to unpack,
so let's go back to
the first pin drop

31:06.564 --> 31:08.499
when Princess
was still pregnant.

31:08.566 --> 31:11.002
You were at the fashion show,
Moniece.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.304
What were your first thoughts
when you saw her get the mic?

31:13.371 --> 31:16.708
{\an1}In light of the fact that
I'm in a different head space,

31:16.774 --> 31:21.112
{\an7}I want to apologize
to both Princess and Ray
for losing my temper.

31:21.179 --> 31:25.750
Nothing and no one should
ever get me to that place.

31:25.817 --> 31:30.555
To have no regard
for an unborn life

31:30.622 --> 31:33.825
{\an1}in not normal,
and I recognize that.

31:33.891 --> 31:35.893
Do you accept her apology?

31:35.960 --> 31:39.097
{\an8}I do accept your apology.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.097
{\an7}Like, be cool.
Like, we all right.

31:39.163 --> 31:43.001
(cheers and applause)

31:43.067 --> 31:45.136
{\an5}Let me say something
else to Nina.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.136
Oh, go ahead.

31:45.203 --> 31:46.704
Go ahead.
Let me start a response.

31:46.771 --> 31:50.041
So I do want to apologize for
saying something about your son.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.477
{\an4}Thank you.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.477
I know that's what you've
always wanted from me,

31:52.543 --> 31:55.747
{\an5}but with the back and
forth, I felt like I
didn't owe you that

31:55.813 --> 31:58.716
because of how you
always came at me,

31:58.783 --> 32:01.786
but you did throw
the drink at me first,

32:01.853 --> 32:05.456
{\an5}and that's why I talked
about your motherhood,
but I do apologize.

32:05.523 --> 32:08.960
{\an5}I'm a mother and I get it.

32:05.523 --> 32:08.960
{\an1}Thank you.

32:09.027 --> 32:14.832
{\an1}Princess is good.
Bring out the Ray J champagne.

32:14.899 --> 32:16.134
(audience ohing)

32:16.200 --> 32:17.435
{\an5}Whoa, wait, hold on!

32:16.200 --> 32:17.435
Really?

32:17.502 --> 32:19.937
We're nice, we're nice,
we're nice, we're nice.

32:21.506 --> 32:24.075
{\an8}Come on, y'all.
Let's love each other.

32:24.142 --> 32:28.012
{\an8}(cheering)

32:28.079 --> 32:29.747
You guys, mmm!

32:29.814 --> 32:31.149
{\an8}Y'all (bleep) need to clap.

32:31.215 --> 32:33.951
{\an5}I'm gonna be the hype man.
Come on.

32:31.215 --> 32:33.951
(applause)

32:34.018 --> 32:38.189
{\an5}I know that you had some choice
words for Brandy and Sonya
when you were pregnant,

32:38.256 --> 32:41.459
{\an5}but now that you've had
Melody, how is your
relationship with them?

32:41.526 --> 32:44.162
{\an8}I think Melody has
brought us together.

32:41.526 --> 32:44.162
{\an5}Absolutely.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.764
{\an8}My mom here now with
the baby, watching
the baby in the back.

32:46.831 --> 32:48.800
I love that.
I've got to go say hello.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.135
All right, guys, we're gonna
keep it on the positive note.

32:51.202 --> 32:54.305
{\an5}Coming up, we're looking
back at some of the
season's wildest moments,

32:54.372 --> 32:58.576
plus Kimberly hits the stage.
More of the reunion after this.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.912
(cheers and applause)

33:00.978 --> 33:04.482
{\an8}Ray J and Princess, any
plans to have a brother
or sister for Melody?
