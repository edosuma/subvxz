00:39.710 --> 00:43.140
<i>As Japan enjoys peace, the samurai era
is waning. But this calm is threatened</i>

00:43.150 --> 00:47.210
<i>by the growing power of Lord Naritsugu,
the Shogun's sadistic younger brother.</i>

00:47.960 --> 00:51.110
<i>Sir Doi realizes he will ruin the Shogunate
if he gains higher political standing.</i>

00:51.120 --> 00:54.940
<i>As Naritsugu's evil deeds are
quickly hushed up, Sir Doi must act.</i>

02:35.520 --> 02:39.800
<i>Offered above (to my lord).</i>

02:42.820 --> 02:50.010
<i>On March 5 of the first year of the Koka era (1844),
Akashi Clan House Elder Mamiya Zusho commits harakiri.</i>

02:45.510 --> 02:52.090
To the Shogun, Mamiya's harakiri
was against Lord Naritsugu.

02:53.220 --> 02:56.180
Lord Naritsugu was born
with a vicious nature.

02:56.870 --> 03:01.520
His lust for flesh and dishonorable
conduct cannot be pardoned.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.170
What should we do?

03:05.490 --> 03:09.180
Shogun Council Elders,
Sir Doi has returned.

03:24.680 --> 03:33.350
The Shogun orders us to settle the
matter of his half-brother quietly.

03:38.650 --> 03:45.470
We blame those that named
Naritsugu an adopted Akashi son.

03:46.130 --> 03:50.490
This dilemma drove Mamiya to harakiri.

03:50.930 --> 03:55.280
- His appeal to us for action...
- I'm aware of that!

03:55.590 --> 04:00.960
But we must respect the Shogun's rule.

04:02.490 --> 04:05.870
His justice is sanctified by heaven's will.

04:07.050 --> 04:10.570
Arguing is pointless!

04:41.340 --> 04:43.670
Shimada Shinzaemon, I presume?

04:45.700 --> 04:46.680
In the flesh.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.350
You're a hard man to find.

04:58.310 --> 05:05.940
13 ASSASSINS

05:10.280 --> 05:11.800
Sir Doi.

05:12.820 --> 05:15.030
Sorry for the late hour.

05:15.350 --> 05:19.730
I've been a widower for years,
with few family obligations.

05:22.680 --> 05:27.400
Perhaps you've heard about the outrage.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.710
So...

05:37.540 --> 05:40.810
What do you make of Lord Naritsugu?

05:46.050 --> 05:47.890
Forgive my frankness...

05:48.890 --> 05:52.470
He is no worthy heir to
the noble Akashi Clan.

05:53.610 --> 05:58.970
With the Shogun's consent,
I suggest Naritsugu steps down.

05:59.870 --> 06:02.510
A more suitable heir is needed.

06:02.980 --> 06:06.050
The Shogun will not grant it.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.290
Why not?

06:10.580 --> 06:18.120
He has appointed Naritsugu
as his senior advisor,

06:18.510 --> 06:21.510
effective on Naritsugu's
next visit to Edo.

06:22.570 --> 06:27.930
The Shogun will allow that boy
to meddle in political affairs?

06:28.940 --> 06:34.130
Incidentally, I invited someone here.

06:35.390 --> 06:36.880
Speak with him.

06:51.980 --> 06:58.650
I'm Makino Yukie, a subject of Lord of
Owari. I serve the Agematsu in Kiso.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.690
I'm Shimada Shinzaemon.

07:02.110 --> 07:03.690
Kiso?

07:05.410 --> 07:10.670
I heard about an incident last year
between the Akashi and Owari clans.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.280
Rumors of a scandal...

07:13.300 --> 07:18.490
I'll tell you all.
I'll keep no secrets.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.310
In April of last year...

07:26.040 --> 07:30.300
Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi Clan...

07:31.040 --> 07:35.790
stayed overnight at Kiso.

07:39.230 --> 07:43.010
He is the son of the former Shogun.

07:43.910 --> 07:46.240
Nobility must be properly served.

07:47.020 --> 07:52.020
Our wives and daughters were
brought in for his full hospitality.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.200
Uneme.

08:01.290 --> 08:02.360
Father.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.040
- Is his feast in order?
- Yes.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.240
And the picture scrolls for his
entertainment.

08:08.430 --> 08:09.840
I'll fetch them.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.360
Have your wife get them instead.

08:18.490 --> 08:19.490
Chise.

08:21.340 --> 08:26.600
My son had married Chise
only two months prior.

08:28.070 --> 08:30.810
I ordered her to do this petty task.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.330
And I'll regret it to my grave.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.380
Who might you be?

08:44.790 --> 08:48.730
I belong to the Makino Uneme family.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.810
My Lord, please release me.

09:08.140 --> 09:09.210
Chise.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.230
Chise.

09:15.660 --> 09:16.580
Chise!

09:40.010 --> 09:43.050
Kiso women are such mountain monkeys.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.420
They defy me by scratching.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.700
Are you a monkey too, servant?

10:49.420 --> 10:52.520
Monkey necks can be so tough.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.730
That same night...

11:01.480 --> 11:05.840
Chise slit her throat in disgrace.

11:10.550 --> 11:17.120
My son and his new bride slain...
before my very eyes.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.960
This is torture.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.110
Rather than living in
disgrace I ponder harakiri.

11:29.310 --> 11:34.470
But I can't... I remember the
shame my Lord Owari has endured.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.980
Mock me for grumbling.

11:40.980 --> 11:47.030
I continue my worthless life solely to
remain a living witness to this tragedy.

11:52.140 --> 11:56.650
As the Council Elder enacting
the Shogun's justice...

11:57.860 --> 12:00.810
some things can do, others I cannot.

12:01.910 --> 12:08.340
If I turn my back on the Shogun
and find fault with his lineage,

12:09.610 --> 12:16.520
then his rule will spiral into
chaos and destroy years of peace.

12:20.210 --> 12:25.390
As the Shogun's senior
advisor, I cannot do it.

12:29.010 --> 12:32.600
Are you asking if I can do something?

12:33.400 --> 12:36.550
Since Mamiya's harakiri
protest three days ago...

12:38.930 --> 12:41.770
I've searched my soul for a solution.

12:49.020 --> 12:52.730
I have decided it's you.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.570
Who's the woman?

13:21.100 --> 13:25.380
Akashi lands were once most fertile.

13:26.480 --> 13:31.900
But Naritsugu's relentless land taxes

13:32.320 --> 13:36.270
made starving peasants hunger for revolt.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.990
This woman...

13:40.880 --> 13:45.450
is the daughter of the peasant leader.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.760
He did this...

13:57.520 --> 14:03.250
He cut off her limbs.

14:04.410 --> 14:08.990
And brought her to Edo as his plaything.

14:10.950 --> 14:16.370
But he grew bored with
her and cast her out.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.110
Is there no mercy?

14:30.870 --> 14:37.410
Shinzaemon, I need not
mention my honor and position.

14:39.020 --> 14:45.450
If this continues, chaos will ruin
our nation and the people will suffer.

14:51.190 --> 14:55.530
Poor woman... what of your family's fate?

15:14.490 --> 15:17.060
He cut out her tongue as well.

15:30.800 --> 15:37.400
TOTAL MASSACRE

15:53.040 --> 15:55.260
How fate smiles on me.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.820
As a samurai in this era of peace...

16:05.820 --> 16:07.690
I've been wishing for a noble death.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.520
Now fate has called me here.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.840
See, my hands...

16:19.830 --> 16:22.600
won't stop trembling.

16:29.260 --> 16:33.000
It's a warrior's battle shakes.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.130
I will accomplish your wish...

17:00.210 --> 17:02.640
with magnificence.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.590
Shimada Shinzaemon...

17:15.190 --> 17:20.480
with your gesture, you resolve
my official position.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.230
Sir Hanbei, thank you for coming.

17:29.260 --> 17:34.010
- Asakawa, where's Lord Naritsugu?
- In the banquet hall.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.620
The Mamiya?

17:41.980 --> 17:45.700
I told you not to
trouble the Mamiya family!

17:45.740 --> 17:47.880
I can't disobey Lord Naritsugu's orders.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.480
My Lord!

18:10.800 --> 18:12.420
Yes, Hanbei?

18:12.920 --> 18:17.830
Sir Doi has humbly requested that
you leave the Mamiya family alone...

18:17.830 --> 18:20.110
Governmental orders!

18:20.290 --> 18:24.320
Doi again! That
grumbling Shogun advisor.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.800
Lord Naritsugu!

18:34.470 --> 18:36.790
What makes a samurai warrior?

18:40.410 --> 18:45.000
You men mindlessly chant 'loyalty, duty'
like a Buddhist prayer.

18:45.390 --> 18:48.390
But if servants are spoiled,

18:48.950 --> 18:52.170
then one day, they forget
their duty to serve.

18:52.590 --> 18:56.950
Servants like Mamiya make light
of their master and revolt.

19:01.910 --> 19:05.830
Punishing one's servants, who are
the Shogun's certified property...

19:06.500 --> 19:10.200
Punishment is a master's duty.

19:15.990 --> 19:18.790
Dying for one's master is the way
of the samurai.

19:20.200 --> 19:24.550
Dying for one's husband is the way of women.

19:37.080 --> 19:41.190
We must protect these ways,
right, Hanbei?

19:45.330 --> 19:46.540
Yes.

19:47.340 --> 19:51.710
After debating for three days...

19:52.130 --> 19:55.540
the conclusion was 'no punishment
due to diminished responsibility'.

19:57.380 --> 20:01.700
I wish they would behead me.
I would like to experience that.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.770
The Tokugawa rule won't be long for
this world, will it, Hanbei?

20:18.850 --> 20:20.390
My Lord. Don't say such things.

20:24.780 --> 20:27.300
You know, I will be the Shogun's
chief of staff.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.560
They won't let him get away with it.

20:37.810 --> 20:41.880
Things worked out too easily
for our Lord, don't you think?

20:41.900 --> 20:44.700
He was given special treatment.

20:44.840 --> 20:50.670
Though born of a different mother,
he is still the Shogun's brother.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.500
So how will Sir Doi save face?

20:57.610 --> 21:00.510
As the man in charge of
the nation's justice...

21:01.710 --> 21:08.260
he must deliver a verdict to save
his honor in a scandal like this.

21:09.990 --> 21:13.800
So, Sir Doi is plotting something?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.100
Who goes there?

21:20.320 --> 21:23.260
Attendant Deguchi at your service.

21:24.830 --> 21:29.730
Gather men to spy on Sir Doi.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.680
Bribe the gatekeepers and servants.

21:34.780 --> 21:39.700
Get his list of visitors
since Mamiya's harakiri.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.390
We protect our Lord at all costs.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.570
Such is our duty.

21:56.370 --> 21:59.310
This is not the one.

22:00.410 --> 22:02.670
Hyoudou Genba, The Office of Carpentry.

22:03.260 --> 22:05.490
Makino Yukie of the Owari clan?

22:06.750 --> 22:08.020
Owari?

22:09.470 --> 22:10.910
Makino?

22:11.900 --> 22:15.510
Makino was present during our Kiso visit.

22:16.120 --> 22:21.390
So Makino met with Shinzaemon.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.830
Do you know this Shinzaemon?

22:27.450 --> 22:32.750
We attended the same school,
even trained in the sword at the same dojo.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.040
We were competitive classmates.

22:36.390 --> 22:38.130
Is he that skilled?

22:38.730 --> 22:43.210
He's not as shrewd, not as strong.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.660
But he never gives up.

22:46.340 --> 22:50.730
Backed into a corner, he won't
budge. Won't overplay his hand.

22:51.740 --> 22:55.990
He's a man who beats you in the end.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.730
If Doi has picked him...

23:02.290 --> 23:06.630
then we've drawn the worst luck.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.340
Impressive as always, Hirayama.

23:39.260 --> 23:43.890
I'm sorry for always borrowing
your dojo without permission.

23:44.320 --> 23:50.320
You honor me by using it. Your
spirit keeps the dojo alive.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.370
A match for old time's sake?

23:55.630 --> 23:59.530
Better to save our energy
for bigger tasks, right?

24:00.880 --> 24:06.020
There are no big or small
tasks. All are equally important.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.370
You follow me?

24:16.820 --> 24:19.270
Guess you still lack training.

24:20.610 --> 24:26.840
Since your teaching, I have been on
the path of the sword for ten years.

24:28.680 --> 24:32.160
As the months and seasons changed...

24:32.880 --> 24:36.230
I lived on the money you
gave me as a sword for hire...

24:36.820 --> 24:42.300
knowing that, one day,
I'dsurrender my life to you.

24:44.030 --> 24:48.140
I thought a time would
come when I could repay you.

24:50.030 --> 24:54.150
Yet I have no choice but to regret...

24:55.390 --> 24:59.400
I have not been able
to repay you, master.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.690
Your appreciation...

25:08.050 --> 25:10.560
My small contribution means so much?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.130
I thank you.

25:16.510 --> 25:19.520
What a rare samurai in these times!

25:19.570 --> 25:21.630
Oh, Kuranaga!

25:23.910 --> 25:28.730
Kuranaga Saheita, Team Leader,
from the Public Security Office.

25:30.010 --> 25:33.060
I am closely connected with Shinza
in a fateful bond.

25:33.890 --> 25:36.650
I have become a great fan of him.
Just like you.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.810
I am Hirayama.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.790
We can't waste his spirit.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.140
Have him join us.

25:57.020 --> 26:01.450
I chose five of my men.
They await you inside.

26:07.330 --> 26:11.210
Mitsuhashi, get
acquainted with Hirayama.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.660
I am Mitsuhashi, at your service.

26:21.610 --> 26:26.710
I present my subordinates,
Otake and Hioki.

26:27.510 --> 26:31.940
And my men, Higuchi and Horii.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.710
Hand-picked from hundreds.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.330
We are still so few.

26:41.490 --> 26:46.300
It's hard to find skilled
samurai in this day and age.

26:47.290 --> 26:51.920
Others are samurai of little worth.

26:54.390 --> 26:58.950
Our five lives are in
your hands, Sir Shinzaemon.

26:59.830 --> 27:01.150
I see.

27:02.810 --> 27:08.460
Then listen up.
By private order of Sir Doi...

27:09.620 --> 27:15.450
we've been assigned to take the life
of Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi clan.

27:21.570 --> 27:26.960
Next month, Naritsugu will
leave Edo for the Akashi domain.

27:28.190 --> 27:31.930
If he enters Akashi land,
we can't touch him.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.660
So we strike en route?

27:34.830 --> 27:40.990
That's the plan. It's absurd
with so little time and few men.

27:43.500 --> 27:48.490
But these days, how many samurai
use their swords in actual battle?

27:49.790 --> 27:53.040
Not them, not us. A real challenge.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.220
He who values his life
dies a dog's death.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.770
You've entrusted me with your lives.

28:03.700 --> 28:08.670
I'll spend them at my disposal.

28:14.070 --> 28:16.250
Now, we are nine.

28:17.850 --> 28:22.740
How many other true samurai are left?

28:24.590 --> 28:27.720
I'll take my leave.

28:52.090 --> 28:54.910
What was that meeting?

28:56.280 --> 28:57.600
Akashi samurai?

28:59.540 --> 29:01.010
Now you know!

29:18.490 --> 29:20.990
How dare you point your
sword at us, novice!

29:22.260 --> 29:23.690
Who are you?

29:23.740 --> 29:25.000
State your name.

29:25.520 --> 29:29.050
Hirayama. I'm a ronin.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.300
He killed our sword masters in one slice.

29:38.030 --> 29:43.490
I won't permit such blatant moves again.

29:43.610 --> 29:47.040
If Sir Doi decides to,
the coals we once cooled...

29:47.150 --> 29:51.440
will ignite into a blaze
burning down our clan!

29:51.570 --> 29:54.060
Forgive me for my thoughtless act.

29:55.180 --> 30:00.590
Now it's clear. It is Shinzaemon.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.800
Place your bets.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.130
Odd or even.

30:19.990 --> 30:21.020
Odd.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.000
Odd.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.060
Lady Luck is with you.

30:33.190 --> 30:34.850
Don't talk to me.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.400
What?

30:36.670 --> 30:39.600
Luck leaves when unlucky men talk.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.370
This isn't sake!

31:14.640 --> 31:18.330
Shogun retainer Shimada's third son.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.050
You make a lot of money.

31:21.270 --> 31:24.060
I thought Mizuno's reforms were finished.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.500
What a selfish jerk!

31:25.540 --> 31:27.250
Don't say such things.

31:34.260 --> 31:38.430
Samurai are always asking to borrow money.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.750
My shop is full of pawned swords.

31:42.400 --> 31:47.090
These days, swords are only
good for cutting radishes.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.920
Well, hello Uncle!

32:03.770 --> 32:09.230
Womanizing at your age is
bad form, don't you think?

32:13.530 --> 32:18.180
Bravo Nephew! You young rogue.

32:22.110 --> 32:25.500
Sake bought with gambling
money tastes best.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.280
Spare me the irony.

32:29.180 --> 32:33.430
Gambling is the only time I feel alive.

32:34.380 --> 32:37.900
Samurai status doesn't suit me.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.940
I too hated being a samurai,
but then I realized...

32:42.960 --> 32:47.180
I could never be a true
player by playing around.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.570
A true player doesn't try so hard.

32:53.310 --> 32:55.480
I'm not trying too hard.

32:55.730 --> 32:57.110
I wonder.

32:59.590 --> 33:01.040
How's your girl?

33:03.980 --> 33:05.170
Well...

33:07.890 --> 33:10.170
she hasn't kicked me out yet.

33:12.230 --> 33:15.010
Be yourself. But don't overdo it!

33:19.800 --> 33:23.710
Lords are making their annual trips home.

33:24.290 --> 33:26.520
Shouldn't you be busy?

33:28.130 --> 33:31.700
Work is my excuse to gamble too.

33:34.170 --> 33:36.790
I'm on a mission, a long shot.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.790
Will that gamble pay off?

33:43.990 --> 33:45.170
Pay off?

33:47.730 --> 33:50.270
It's like walking through
the eye of a needle.

33:51.710 --> 33:54.130
Quit while you're ahead.

33:55.380 --> 33:56.840
You're clever.

33:57.510 --> 34:02.790
But your uncle is a born fool.
I go for broke and bet it all.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.720
And if you win?

34:10.680 --> 34:12.860
If by chance, I win...

34:15.340 --> 34:17.610
in time, someone might appreciate me.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.530
Maybe.

34:23.660 --> 34:29.480
Betting on yourself is true
gambling. Who's overdoing it now?

34:34.660 --> 34:36.800
I'll say this, Shinrokuro...

34:37.660 --> 34:44.890
My gamble is more exciting
than yours, with the same odds.

35:18.510 --> 35:21.010
Give us the money in your pocket!

35:22.570 --> 35:25.550
I was hoping I'd met a ghost,
but you're just a robber.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.490
Help...

36:05.680 --> 36:08.550
Please...

36:10.600 --> 36:12.460
Please.

36:15.170 --> 36:16.700
Pathetic.

36:39.130 --> 36:42.300
Shinrokuro, are you home?

36:51.490 --> 36:56.380
You tease. If you're here, say so.

36:59.910 --> 37:02.710
I'm neither here nor there.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.980
No teasing. You're right here.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.590
I saw my uncle.

37:16.290 --> 37:18.540
Sir Shinzaemon?

37:20.450 --> 37:21.770
Yes.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.630
What's wrong? Did something happen?

37:41.080 --> 37:42.250
Tsuya...

37:46.500 --> 37:47.640
No.

37:54.910 --> 37:56.150
Don't.

38:04.970 --> 38:06.330
Shinrokuro.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.560
I'll be gone for a while.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.880
When will you return?

38:23.250 --> 38:27.540
Soon. But if I'm late...

38:31.230 --> 38:32.990
I'll be at the Festival of the Dead.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.620
Burn the honorary torch and wait.

38:52.530 --> 38:56.450
This is my one and only pupil.

38:57.090 --> 38:59.460
Ogura at your service.

39:00.790 --> 39:03.980
Are your parents still alive?

39:06.470 --> 39:10.970
Father died two years ago.
Mother passed when I was five.

39:12.750 --> 39:17.860
I come from a lowly family
serving a noble's concubine.

39:19.180 --> 39:23.140
Since deciding to live for the sword,
I've waited for this day...

39:23.240 --> 39:25.880
to use my skills for society.

39:28.630 --> 39:30.980
Allow me to join you.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.800
I request that you take him too.

39:35.820 --> 39:38.500
But he's too young.

39:39.400 --> 39:45.520
Shinzaemon, you're wrong.
Devotion knows no age.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.510
A samurai's life isn't
measured in years, is it?

39:53.000 --> 39:55.360
My logic was shallow.

39:57.380 --> 40:00.230
May we ask your help?

40:00.750 --> 40:02.310
Than you very much!

40:03.390 --> 40:06.070
I will surrender my life to serve you.

40:08.620 --> 40:11.190
And who might you be?

40:12.810 --> 40:15.800
Sahara, a lowly ronin...

40:16.400 --> 40:19.850
with no redeeming merit but my spear.

40:20.300 --> 40:22.230
I vouch only for his skill.

40:23.670 --> 40:25.860
Hirayama told me of your mission.

40:26.030 --> 40:32.080
Fighting a larger enemy is admirable.
I very much want to join but...

40:33.700 --> 40:36.080
One small request.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.960
Which is?

40:38.060 --> 40:41.030
Pay me 200 ryo up front.

40:41.210 --> 40:44.630
You're only joining for the money?

40:44.670 --> 40:49.520
Let me be clear. My sympathy with your
cause has nothing to do with money.

40:50.110 --> 40:55.960
With no relationship or debts to you,
do you expect me to work for free?

40:56.630 --> 40:58.860
How will you use the money?

40:59.750 --> 41:02.960
The first 120 ryo for lifelong debts,

41:03.570 --> 41:06.370
plus something nice for my relatives.

41:07.930 --> 41:11.040
Thirty ryo for a tomb for my wife,
who died from my hardships.

41:12.110 --> 41:14.210
Twenty for my preparations as well.

41:15.130 --> 41:16.540
And the rest?

41:17.180 --> 41:22.400
To experience the 'luxuries'
I never had in this life.

41:25.570 --> 41:30.800
My kind of man.
His spirit is a bargain at 200.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.510
Now, we're eleven.

41:34.280 --> 41:38.950
Our quality outshines our quantity.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.210
Shinrokuro is here.

41:56.520 --> 42:00.320
I'll take the odds on your big gamble.

42:00.980 --> 42:02.230
What do you wager?

42:02.580 --> 42:05.470
If it's a true gamble, there's
only one thing I can bet.

42:14.500 --> 42:18.840
If you refuse, start by killing me now.

42:31.420 --> 42:34.500
And now, we're twelve!

42:54.910 --> 42:59.640
No mercy! There's no samurai
code or fair play in battle!

43:06.260 --> 43:10.670
No sword? Use a stick.
No stick? Use a rock.

43:10.940 --> 43:13.860
No rock? Use your fists and feet!

43:14.330 --> 43:19.460
Lose your life. But make the enemy pay!

43:21.360 --> 43:22.610
Horii.

43:24.610 --> 43:26.020
Higuchi.

43:27.090 --> 43:29.270
Train in explosives.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.760
<i>Rest in peace.</i>

43:50.670 --> 43:53.200
<i>I'll join you shortly.</i>

43:56.430 --> 44:01.630
Hurry up with the
preparations. We depart soon.

44:21.700 --> 44:26.260
Sir Kito! The soldiers who can't get
home are starting to worry.

44:26.300 --> 44:30.020
Leave them. This isn't the usual
annual trip home.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.940
The enemy will also be getting
soldiers ready.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.640
It's not easy to defend the road.

44:35.970 --> 44:38.300
We can't take any that will hold
the others back.

44:39.660 --> 44:41.800
Use any means necessary.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.260
Be prepared for the unexpected.

44:46.380 --> 44:49.450
Lord Naritsugu departs tomorrow.

44:49.850 --> 44:51.560
Finally, he makes a move.

44:51.850 --> 44:55.790
So where's our best point of attack?

44:56.420 --> 44:58.990
How about the Toda boat crossing?

44:59.240 --> 45:02.540
They'll send half their men first.

45:02.920 --> 45:06.540
The others will stand guard
while Naritsugu crosses.

45:06.900 --> 45:11.270
Their troops split...
Better to attack then.

45:11.340 --> 45:14.200
No, they'll be on full alert.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.250
Won't make any wrong moves.

45:16.750 --> 45:22.240
Let's keep them anxious and running,
never knowing where we'll strike.

45:25.330 --> 45:28.080
That's a good point to consider.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.400
Shinza? You here?

45:32.890 --> 45:35.560
It's Kito Hanbei of the Akashi Clan.

45:42.490 --> 45:43.610
Shinza!

45:53.080 --> 45:55.240
Hanbei. I knew you'd come.

45:57.470 --> 45:59.150
Glad to see you.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.260
I thought you'd left already.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.730
If we had time, I'd enjoy a match of go.

46:09.140 --> 46:11.890
I still lead in wins.

46:12.460 --> 46:15.530
Leave our score aside
until we meet again.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.570
Again?

46:19.500 --> 46:23.690
For years I envied you: a man from
a good family, close to the Shogun...

46:23.690 --> 46:25.530
appointed to his elite guards.

46:26.250 --> 46:32.800
After you moved up, I
commanded the same post.

46:34.270 --> 46:38.960
To catch up, I joined Lord Naritsugu.

46:40.260 --> 46:45.770
He earned a fortune when he
was adopted by the Akashi.

46:48.100 --> 46:50.510
That led me into this situation.

46:52.610 --> 46:55.430
What an ill twist of fate.

46:57.310 --> 47:00.820
Perhaps we both embraced fate.

47:02.230 --> 47:04.380
A samurai leads a helpless life.

47:05.810 --> 47:11.510
Mamiya should've committed
harakiri in front of his Lord.

47:13.260 --> 47:15.170
I once had that intention...

47:16.270 --> 47:22.650
but I could not betray his
father, the former Shogun.

47:25.900 --> 47:28.350
I lost my chance to move ahead.

47:29.720 --> 47:32.560
I regret not beating you.

47:33.980 --> 47:36.990
I was unable to commit harakiri.

47:40.110 --> 47:45.000
As a samurai, I'll do what
must be done for the people.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.450
For the people?

47:53.510 --> 47:59.860
A samurai must do but one
thing. Serve his master, correct?

48:09.580 --> 48:12.000
What an ill twist of fate.

48:14.230 --> 48:18.640
It's a long road to the Akashi domain.

48:19.450 --> 48:21.040
See you there.

48:21.660 --> 48:22.870
Bet on it.

49:25.900 --> 49:28.420
Bring me two women tonight.

50:00.090 --> 50:03.090
EDO

50:44.680 --> 50:49.040
<i>Uncle, three days have passed
since Naritsugu left Edo.</i>

50:50.740 --> 50:54.200
<i>Where do we make our stand?</i>

50:58.100 --> 51:01.010
<i>How will Shinza make his move?</i>

51:28.960 --> 51:30.980
We kept you waiting.

51:33.180 --> 51:38.470
It's been decided. Brothers,
we take Lord Naritsugu at...

51:41.670 --> 51:45.170
Ochiai in the Mino province.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.080
OCHIAI

51:49.400 --> 51:54.540
Kiso is ruled by the Tenryo to the north
and the Owari to the south.

51:56.010 --> 52:00.420
The border lies on this river
between Fukushima and Kiso.

52:00.960 --> 52:06.350
Naritsugu offended the Owari
by killing Makino's son in Kiso.

52:07.760 --> 52:12.940
We can enlist Makino's help at Kiso.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.910
Ask him to sign a non-transit
act using Lord Owari's name...

52:17.420 --> 52:20.050
to ban Naritsugu from passing.

52:21.080 --> 52:25.920
He'll join us due to the murder
of his son and daughter-in-law.

52:26.990 --> 52:28.030
And then?

52:28.190 --> 52:31.920
The entourage will stall at the border.

52:32.440 --> 52:37.990
But stubborn Naritsugu won't
dare return to Edo.

52:38.790 --> 52:42.650
He'll avoid all Owari territories.

52:42.970 --> 52:47.520
Sending his entourage through
Owari land...

52:47.530 --> 52:51.650
Naritsugu and bis bodyguards
will take this route,

52:51.880 --> 52:55.250
travelling south to Iida.

52:55.430 --> 53:01.730
From Iida to Okazaki,
then boating up river...

53:02.460 --> 53:05.490
And meeting up with his
entourage here.

53:06.290 --> 53:08.170
Or so you would think!

53:08.750 --> 53:15.010
Don't overlook the Naegi Clan of Mino,
positioned between the Owari lands.

53:16.400 --> 53:21.570
Naritsugu has already sent word to all
the clans along his route.

53:21.750 --> 53:26.970
He'll be a laughing stock if he skips
the tiny Naegi Clan, as if on the run.

53:27.860 --> 53:33.150
Naritsugu's pride will be his downfall.
He'll take a boat up the Nakatsu River.

53:35.240 --> 53:38.020
There are only two possible routes.

53:38.260 --> 53:42.820
The Kiso Pass or the Kamizaka Pass.

53:43.780 --> 53:48.220
Either way, he must pass via Ochiai.

53:48.820 --> 53:53.170
We'll fortify Ochiai and strike hard.

53:54.920 --> 54:00.440
What if they forgo appearances and
don't pay respect to the Naegi clan?

54:00.700 --> 54:05.010
There's a chance they may not stop.

54:06.620 --> 54:08.880
But I wager they will.

54:11.880 --> 54:14.890
With twelve men challenging
a bigger enemy...

54:15.780 --> 54:21.570
no matter how much we plan,
we must have faith in luck.

54:22.060 --> 54:24.770
We choose here, and risk it all.

54:27.350 --> 54:32.700
With heaven's will, the dice say Ochiai.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.520
Interesting!

54:39.650 --> 54:44.490
Kuranaga, you're best suited
to get Makino's assistance.

54:44.710 --> 54:49.000
Leave it to me. I'll
get that road blocked.

54:49.100 --> 54:51.360
- Take Ishizuka with you.
- I'm grateful.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.030
Let's get moving.

54:54.440 --> 54:55.560
Excuse us.

54:57.910 --> 54:59.740
Mitsuhashi, ready the horses.

54:59.850 --> 55:02.100
Ready and waiting, sir.

55:02.350 --> 55:08.280
Go on ahead and negotiate
with the Mayor of Ochiai.

55:09.930 --> 55:13.310
Give him these orders from Sir Doi.

55:14.030 --> 55:17.690
Understood. How should I proceed?

55:18.220 --> 55:24.420
Ochiai has many inns. Buy them out
at 50 ryo each. 3,750 ryo in total.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.460
Buy them all out.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.020
Yes, sir.

55:31.020 --> 55:34.150
Get battle supplies for
our plan as well.

55:35.620 --> 55:39.670
I'll spend the money like
there's no tomorrow.

55:42.150 --> 55:43.740
See you there.

55:44.610 --> 55:46.210
I'll take Horii with me.

55:54.540 --> 55:55.640
Let's ride!

55:57.150 --> 56:00.700
Fast and hard to pass the enemy!

57:01.490 --> 57:03.370
I'm hungry.

57:03.660 --> 57:05.620
I want a bath!

57:05.720 --> 57:08.010
I want a woman.

57:45.760 --> 57:47.810
Are you Shimada Shinzaemon?

57:48.900 --> 57:50.230
In the flesh.

57:51.340 --> 57:53.170
Are you Akashi henchmen?

58:52.770 --> 58:54.350
Don't follow them!

58:55.650 --> 58:57.180
Anyone hurt?

59:00.870 --> 59:04.670
That Hanbei, he drew first blood.

59:05.510 --> 59:08.970
Probably put coins in the
hands of these broke ronin.

59:09.170 --> 59:13.650
Not a real attack. His aim
was to break our strength.

59:21.700 --> 59:23.520
First time you killed as well?

59:24.840 --> 59:27.520
I've fenced with real
blades many times but...

59:28.830 --> 59:30.800
killing a man is a first.

59:37.870 --> 59:41.920
There's only one road, but we
don't know where they'll strike.

59:42.660 --> 59:46.000
If they attack harder next time,
we could get hurt.

59:48.600 --> 59:52.570
Let's accept Hanbei's welcome.

59:56.590 --> 1:00:00.880
And we'll vanish as well.

1:00:39.060 --> 1:00:42.120
Hioki's got some new friends!

1:00:45.910 --> 1:00:47.050
Disgusting!

1:01:13.100 --> 1:01:16.480
We'll travel northwest along the
ridge, and cut through the valley.

1:01:16.730 --> 1:01:20.740
Over the mountain to Owari territory.

1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.760
I had strict monastic training
in the mountains when I was young.

1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:34.690
The mountain brings blessings but
it's true nature is fear itself.

1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:37.080
I see.

1:01:46.510 --> 1:01:50.120
We are nobodies.

1:01:52.740 --> 1:01:57.950
He's right. No titles,
no affiliations. Nobodies.

1:02:38.510 --> 1:02:40.150
A buyout?

1:02:40.380 --> 1:02:41.660
That is our wish.

1:02:42.690 --> 1:02:46.720
I won't go against Sir Doi's orders.

1:02:47.490 --> 1:02:51.540
But convincing the town will be hard.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:08.580
Our deposit. Not enough?

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:19.810
The forest grows thicker.

1:03:20.930 --> 1:03:24.150
Hirayama, we're lost.

1:03:26.070 --> 1:03:28.520
Perhaps we should've
turned at that cliff?

1:03:28.540 --> 1:03:30.780
- That can't be.
- But...

1:03:39.660 --> 1:03:41.980
Who are you?

1:03:42.710 --> 1:03:46.010
A bandit? Or a raccoon goblin?

1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.600
Do I look like a raccoon?

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:03.550
Couldn't lower me down...

1:04:05.210 --> 1:04:06.100
Idiot!

1:04:06.330 --> 1:04:08.520
At least thank me.

1:04:11.020 --> 1:04:13.160
Are you from these parts?

1:04:15.430 --> 1:04:17.500
- Do I look like it?
- Insolence!

1:04:32.490 --> 1:04:35.950
I ain't no ghost or bandit.

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:41.060
I hunt beasts from mountain to mountain.

1:04:41.620 --> 1:04:42.790
Any men with you?

1:04:44.510 --> 1:04:47.980
Gone. 'Cause I laid my hands on Upashi.

1:04:49.020 --> 1:04:50.180
Upashi?

1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:54.060
The boss's woman.

1:04:55.950 --> 1:05:00.060
So he punished you. Fools
are the same wherever you go.

1:05:01.010 --> 1:05:02.300
Hold your tongue!

1:05:02.630 --> 1:05:04.440
Got a name, son?

1:05:07.300 --> 1:05:08.650
Kiga Koyata.

1:05:09.090 --> 1:05:12.240
My ancestors were defeated
warriors, legitimate samurai stock.

1:05:16.460 --> 1:05:17.940
What's so funny?

1:05:18.630 --> 1:05:22.760
The name's Shinzaemon.
And these are my men.

1:05:25.590 --> 1:05:27.780
What are samurai doing out here?

1:05:28.900 --> 1:05:32.220
A shortcut made us lose our way.

1:05:36.510 --> 1:05:40.420
I'll be your guide, if you've got food.

1:05:42.510 --> 1:05:43.660
Deal?

1:05:45.860 --> 1:05:47.080
Deal?

1:06:02.010 --> 1:06:03.300
What's that?

1:06:04.670 --> 1:06:06.960
Don't like bugs? Watch.

1:06:12.250 --> 1:06:13.940
Don't be a little girl!

1:06:15.110 --> 1:06:16.260
What?

1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:26.010
Let's go.

1:06:30.740 --> 1:06:31.940
What now?

1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:07.250
Leave the rabbit.

1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:09.940
We have important work to do.

1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:13.460
More important than roast rabbit?

1:07:18.220 --> 1:07:19.360
Sir Hanbei!

1:07:20.270 --> 1:07:21.410
What is it?

1:07:21.870 --> 1:07:22.910
Emergency.

1:07:22.950 --> 1:07:25.250
Lord Naritsugu's passage is banned.

1:07:25.270 --> 1:07:27.800
What? His passage is banned?

1:07:34.930 --> 1:07:36.150
What's the matter?

1:07:44.690 --> 1:07:49.450
You fools, will you stand idly by
at this humiliation?

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:04.070
Lord Owari is from the top three clans.

1:08:05.050 --> 1:08:08.100
But I am the son of the former Shogun,

1:08:09.230 --> 1:08:12.020
and brother to the current Shogun.

1:08:13.180 --> 1:08:14.260
Cross over!

1:08:14.990 --> 1:08:16.490
Watch and learn.

1:08:16.540 --> 1:08:20.500
We must go through Owari land.
Can our Lord swallow his pride?

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:25.510
Let's see if he gets his way
as he usually does.

1:08:30.610 --> 1:08:31.980
Who are you?

1:08:34.090 --> 1:08:35.400
Identify yourself.

1:08:40.060 --> 1:08:41.040
Out of my way.

1:08:42.810 --> 1:08:44.770
Or I'll kill you without mercy.

1:08:46.740 --> 1:08:48.480
Last April...

1:08:49.230 --> 1:08:52.440
in Kiso, you killed my son

1:08:53.550 --> 1:08:57.630
Makino Uneme and his
wife. I am Makino Yukie.

1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:03.560
Does daddy monkey have hard bones too?

1:09:06.890 --> 1:09:07.870
My Lord!

1:09:13.900 --> 1:09:14.900
Hanbei?

1:09:15.990 --> 1:09:17.080
Leave this.

1:09:17.730 --> 1:09:20.010
Let's go back.

1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:33.200
Owari only banned Lord Naritsugu.

1:09:34.300 --> 1:09:39.240
His entourage can enter.
They are Akashi members.

1:09:39.830 --> 1:09:41.090
I see.

1:09:41.700 --> 1:09:43.530
The rest will guard our Lord.

1:09:44.470 --> 1:09:47.790
Skip the Naegi Clan visit and
go to Okazaki.

1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:49.350
Sir Kito...

1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:53.570
If people hear Owari blocked us...

1:09:53.610 --> 1:09:57.980
If we don't visit the Naegi,
our Lord will be ridiculed.

1:09:58.010 --> 1:09:59.890
Let them laugh.

1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:04.040
Within a year, our lord will be
second-in-command.

1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:10.750
You risk his life and the Akashi
clan by visiting the Naegi.

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:16.950
You seem most afraid of Shinzaemon.

1:10:17.180 --> 1:10:20.830
What can a weak Shogun servant do?

1:10:21.490 --> 1:10:25.420
Since paying off the ronin,
there's no sign of him.

1:10:25.890 --> 1:10:29.400
Perhaps he fears our clan and ran?

1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:33.730
Don't you see? He's the
one who blocked our passage.

1:10:39.550 --> 1:10:44.570
Do you cling to your life to
make me a laughing stock?

1:10:45.910 --> 1:10:48.480
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

1:10:49.830 --> 1:10:55.650
I hear any samurai would chose death
over making his Lord a laughing stock.

1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:10.020
Choose the foolish path.

1:11:13.670 --> 1:11:15.710
It's more fun that way.

1:11:20.430 --> 1:11:22.860
Let's go, Hanbei.

1:11:23.730 --> 1:11:24.990
Move out!

1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:34.330
Join up!

1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:37.010
Move out!

1:12:37.890 --> 1:12:39.840
We've had enough.

1:12:55.410 --> 1:12:57.770
Oh, the road.

1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:06.630
The road!

1:13:06.910 --> 1:13:08.760
It's a straight run to Ochiai.

1:13:09.620 --> 1:13:12.760
Fast work, Mountain Man.
Much faster than I predicted.

1:13:12.890 --> 1:13:15.910
Koyata, thanks for leading the way.

1:13:16.930 --> 1:13:20.270
This... is for your help.

1:13:29.950 --> 1:13:33.440
I don't need anything, but could
you take me with you?

1:13:33.470 --> 1:13:34.880
What?

1:13:34.940 --> 1:13:38.200
You're not hiding.
You're hunting, right?

1:13:38.890 --> 1:13:40.020
Hunting?

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:41.440
Am I wrong?

1:13:41.490 --> 1:13:43.860
It's not hunting. It's battle!

1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:48.500
Battle? That's great!

1:13:48.540 --> 1:13:49.540
Hey!

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.040
What?

1:13:55.220 --> 1:13:56.410
What?

1:13:58.310 --> 1:13:59.840
What do you want?

1:14:01.060 --> 1:14:02.050
Hey!

1:14:05.230 --> 1:14:06.190
What?

1:14:07.590 --> 1:14:09.500
He's tough as steel.

1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:10.980
What do you want?

1:14:11.820 --> 1:14:16.860
He won't return to the hills.
How about getting his help?

1:14:18.290 --> 1:14:21.030
A man who has battled wild animals...

1:14:21.490 --> 1:14:25.680
might be more useful than any
unskilled samurai.

1:14:26.410 --> 1:14:27.710
I agree.

1:14:28.650 --> 1:14:31.760
He's tougher and smarter
than he looks.

1:14:31.910 --> 1:14:36.270
Without him, we might still be lost.

1:14:38.230 --> 1:14:40.050
Take me, Boss!

1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:45.490
I'm not the boss.

1:14:46.330 --> 1:14:47.910
Shall we take him?

1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:49.660
Wow, Boss!

1:14:50.050 --> 1:14:52.040
I said I'm not the boss.

1:15:06.380 --> 1:15:07.640
Welcome. Been expecting you.

1:15:07.690 --> 1:15:08.840
You've prepared well.

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:10.860
Progress couldn't be better.

1:15:11.570 --> 1:15:13.350
Did it work?

1:15:13.450 --> 1:15:19.700
Makino stopped them perfectly.
Naritsugu diverted his troops.

1:15:19.770 --> 1:15:21.020
Well, well.

1:15:21.060 --> 1:15:23.030
Our long shot paid off.

1:15:23.670 --> 1:15:25.050
How many men with Naritsugu?

1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:26.220
Seventy men.

1:15:26.750 --> 1:15:28.990
And Makino?

1:15:29.780 --> 1:15:35.310
He left nothing to chance.
He chose the path of harakiri.

1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:40.980
He took full blame,
left no evidence behind.

1:15:42.510 --> 1:15:44.070
He was a mighty samurai.

1:15:47.570 --> 1:15:51.920
We must achieve our mission for him.

1:15:53.710 --> 1:15:55.630
Hey!

1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:02.250
Got dinner!

1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:04.190
Who is he?

1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:08.190
He dropped in when
we entered the forest.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:10.220
Dropped in?

1:16:24.070 --> 1:16:25.220
I'm...

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.450
Oh, wrong side...

1:16:29.650 --> 1:16:33.680
I'm Tokubei, the mayor of Ochiai.

1:16:33.670 --> 1:16:35.150
Sorry for the trouble.

1:16:35.260 --> 1:16:43.450
No trouble at all. We're very blessed
to be receiving such money.

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:46.160
I guess money talks wherever you go.

1:16:46.220 --> 1:16:50.800
Do as you please. Rip the town down,
burn it... it matters not to me.

1:16:50.820 --> 1:16:52.620
But then you can't live here.

1:16:52.730 --> 1:16:56.740
Once you've finished your business
here, you won't need the town.

1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:59.550
So we'll just rebuild.

1:17:01.220 --> 1:17:08.170
If you need anything in... the female
department, for an extra fee...

1:17:08.190 --> 1:17:09.570
Enough!

1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:14.920
We're gambling our lives for the
country doing important work.

1:17:15.450 --> 1:17:17.510
Please mind your manners.

1:17:18.250 --> 1:17:22.850
Me and my big mouth! Forgive
it as a rustic man's joke.

1:17:23.300 --> 1:17:27.080
We're only renting your inns.
Be gone when you're done.

1:17:28.580 --> 1:17:30.490
We don't require special attention.

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:34.120
Men, rest up.

1:17:34.590 --> 1:17:36.560
Show me around.

1:17:37.430 --> 1:17:40.070
Hiroyama, Shinrokuro, follow me.

1:17:41.390 --> 1:17:44.070
Everyone, this way please!

1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:45.580
Hey!

1:17:50.610 --> 1:17:51.940
Any fine women?

1:17:51.970 --> 1:17:54.730
Very fine and young and...

1:17:55.920 --> 1:17:59.920
Please come this way!

1:18:04.850 --> 1:18:09.440
Set a trap here using this rock wall.

1:18:15.930 --> 1:18:18.460
This alley is a hard nut to crack.

1:18:22.610 --> 1:18:24.750
Shinrokuro, what do you see?

1:18:25.550 --> 1:18:28.010
Looks like an ordinary boarding town.

1:18:28.050 --> 1:18:29.050
It is.

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:34.260
So we'll transform it
into a town of death.

1:18:34.860 --> 1:18:37.380
Mitsuhashi, get busy
with the preparations.

1:18:38.670 --> 1:18:41.310
Send Ishizuka to keep watch.

1:18:52.090 --> 1:18:53.360
Upashi.

1:19:18.980 --> 1:19:20.270
Miss home?

1:19:23.190 --> 1:19:24.970
I miss Upashi.

1:19:26.780 --> 1:19:28.310
Is she that fine?

1:19:30.650 --> 1:19:35.410
Like no woman you've ever seen.

1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:43.510
Soon, this quiet town
will become a bloodbath.

1:19:44.950 --> 1:19:46.960
Go home alive while you can.

1:19:49.980 --> 1:19:51.840
I've got no home.

1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:55.590
This is our fight. You're not a samurai.

1:19:59.550 --> 1:20:00.990
Don't trifle with your life.

1:20:01.350 --> 1:20:02.430
Got it?

1:20:06.530 --> 1:20:08.430
Damn samurai!

1:20:09.580 --> 1:20:14.000
You and your honor and causes!

1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:18.050
I'll show you!

1:20:51.270 --> 1:20:51.910
Otake.

1:20:51.930 --> 1:20:54.030
This is Hell.

1:20:54.620 --> 1:20:59.580
Otake, hang in there!
Are you all right?

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:04.950
Hey, bring me another girl!
Get the money from Shinrokuro.

1:21:05.050 --> 1:21:07.980
I beg your pardon but that's
every girl here.

1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:10.250
You've wasted them all!

1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:17.040
Town girls are a bit soft.
They've got no endurance.

1:21:22.540 --> 1:21:24.490
Hey, you! One more time!

1:21:24.500 --> 1:21:28.930
She's dead tired! Please stop!

1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:39.950
What a splendid member...

1:21:44.660 --> 1:21:47.350
How charming.

1:22:14.110 --> 1:22:15.620
Upashi!

1:22:27.150 --> 1:22:28.120
Vanished?

1:22:28.660 --> 1:22:32.100
Lord Naritsugu passed through
Komagane along the Ina road.

1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:36.660
Then he vanished.

1:22:36.980 --> 1:22:39.170
Back to Edo?

1:22:39.420 --> 1:22:42.030
Not possible with Naritsugu in control.

1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:47.420
I'm concerned he'll cut through
to the Sanshu road and skip lida.

1:22:48.110 --> 1:22:50.220
Without visiting the Naegi clan?

1:22:52.870 --> 1:22:53.990
Stand down.

1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:56.820
Now, the playing field is level.

1:22:57.550 --> 1:23:00.990
Hanbei is trying to
ascertain our next move.

1:23:03.510 --> 1:23:06.080
We wait here. Prepare for battle.

1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:14.300
Batten down that side.

1:23:28.310 --> 1:23:30.100
Yes! Put it there.

1:23:56.650 --> 1:24:01.290
If they don't show today,
they must've gone to Okazaki.

1:24:01.830 --> 1:24:03.570
Another route?

1:24:04.690 --> 1:24:07.870
Waiting is killing our chances.

1:24:08.420 --> 1:24:11.490
Let's abandon Ochiai tonight.

1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:14.880
We can cross the pass
to the Sanshu Road.

1:24:16.740 --> 1:24:19.930
Shinzaemon, it's time to decide!

1:24:21.020 --> 1:24:21.780
Too soon.

1:24:21.810 --> 1:24:22.850
But...

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:28.560
Do you know the secret to fishing?

1:24:32.220 --> 1:24:35.500
Wait till the fish swallows the hook.

1:24:35.670 --> 1:24:37.830
Reel it when it swallows. It's simple.

1:24:38.070 --> 1:24:46.510
But if you reel in too soon,
the fish will escape with the bait.

1:24:48.130 --> 1:24:52.010
So you're saying the Akashi are close?

1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:58.090
With Hanbei at Naritsugu's
side, there is a chance...

1:24:58.630 --> 1:25:00.770
They might skip the Naegi.

1:25:01.310 --> 1:25:03.530
Their numbers are not like ours.

1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:06.480
Even if they went off the road...

1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:12.880
seventy men cannot travel
without being noticed.

1:25:15.630 --> 1:25:20.980
They must be in one place,
awaiting our next move.

1:25:21.940 --> 1:25:24.220
And if this is so?

1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:28.310
They'll come if they think its safe.

1:25:29.890 --> 1:25:33.710
We wait until the
fish swallows the hook.

1:25:49.650 --> 1:25:50.910
They're here!

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:53.210
They're here!

1:25:54.130 --> 1:25:55.360
They're coming!

1:25:56.410 --> 1:25:57.930
The Akashi men are coming!

1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.180
From where?

1:26:00.830 --> 1:26:05.520
Along the Ohira Road.
But there aren't seventy.

1:26:05.630 --> 1:26:06.420
What?

1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:10.550
Many more.

1:26:11.140 --> 1:26:12.620
Over two hundred!

1:26:13.090 --> 1:26:14.050
Two hundred?

1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.970
Hanbei! He bought time and
summoned troops from other areas!

1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:42.010
Twelve men can never defeat
two hundred.

1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:46.110
So what!

1:26:46.490 --> 1:26:50.030
As for the fish that takes
the hook... the bigger, the better.

1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:00.080
Heaven's will brought us all together.

1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:10.700
Thirteen.

1:27:15.340 --> 1:27:20.390
The time has come to lay down
your lives for the greater cause.

1:27:23.580 --> 1:27:24.750
Are you ready?

1:27:26.270 --> 1:27:27.790
Ready to die?

1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:29.700
Yes!

1:28:25.030 --> 1:28:28.550
Take your posts!

1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:52.310
Halt!

1:28:55.700 --> 1:28:57.110
Asakawa, wait here.

1:28:57.860 --> 1:28:59.040
Let me through.

1:29:35.340 --> 1:29:36.550
Move out!

1:30:26.460 --> 1:30:28.530
How much longer to Nakatsugawa?

1:30:31.100 --> 1:30:32.960
Tell me how far!

1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:46.090
What's the matter?

1:30:46.760 --> 1:30:47.960
Oh, no!

1:30:48.480 --> 1:30:49.810
My Lord!

1:30:55.570 --> 1:30:57.860
Turn back! My Lord!

1:31:36.430 --> 1:31:38.820
What fun. I'm going in, Hanbei!

1:31:41.820 --> 1:31:43.880
My Lord! Follow him!

1:31:49.070 --> 1:31:50.200
Hey!

1:31:53.050 --> 1:31:54.700
You can get past this way.

1:31:56.720 --> 1:31:58.890
This way, this way.

1:33:00.380 --> 1:33:01.510
Shinzaemon.

1:33:02.100 --> 1:33:07.990
I presume you are the Akashi
entourage of Lord Naritsugu.

1:33:10.770 --> 1:33:15.330
By the order of His Shogun's
subject Shinzaemon...

1:33:15.690 --> 1:33:19.580
we commemorate your passage with arrows!

1:33:22.410 --> 1:33:23.370
My Lord!

1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:27.870
My Lord!

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.030
Leave the horses. Protect our Lord.

1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:34.540
My Lord!

1:34:45.330 --> 1:34:47.170
Come this way.

1:34:48.550 --> 1:34:49.770
Please wait.

1:34:50.630 --> 1:34:51.820
Secure the interior.

1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:54.530
Secure the interior.

1:34:55.380 --> 1:34:56.880
Hey, secure the interior.

1:35:45.990 --> 1:35:47.910
Enough petty tricks.

1:35:54.750 --> 1:35:58.010
Only 130 left!

1:35:58.810 --> 1:36:01.490
What you paid for my life...

1:36:01.910 --> 1:36:03.610
was a real bargain.

1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:09.100
The enemy is not large! Don't panic.

1:36:10.100 --> 1:36:12.670
Show them the spirit of Akashi samurai!

1:36:13.110 --> 1:36:17.850
Trade your lives to protect our Lord.

1:36:36.950 --> 1:36:37.960
My Lord!

1:36:39.590 --> 1:36:40.540
Lord!

1:36:50.060 --> 1:36:55.430
TOTAL MASSACRE

1:37:11.490 --> 1:37:14.440
Kill! Kill them all!

1:39:40.340 --> 1:39:41.440
Ogura!

1:40:01.020 --> 1:40:03.340
Fire? No, no!

1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:49.280
My Lord! I found a way out!

1:40:57.730 --> 1:41:00.240
No! It's a trap.

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.130
My Lord.

1:41:13.790 --> 1:41:14.720
Come!

1:41:47.020 --> 1:41:48.060
Hioki!

1:42:01.110 --> 1:42:02.490
Go, go!

1:42:02.900 --> 1:42:04.330
This way, my Lord.

1:42:47.010 --> 1:42:48.140
Look.

1:43:14.100 --> 1:43:18.500
Ogura, kill the men that get past me.

1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:21.600
Don't leave one alive.

1:43:22.380 --> 1:43:23.620
Yes.

1:43:28.630 --> 1:43:30.060
Kill!

1:44:36.850 --> 1:44:38.270
Retreat.

1:44:42.490 --> 1:44:43.670
Ogura!

1:45:19.850 --> 1:45:22.170
Your samurai brawls are crazy fun.

1:45:22.550 --> 1:45:24.260
It's no brawl!

1:45:27.860 --> 1:45:29.860
Why are you samurai so arrogant?

1:45:33.250 --> 1:45:35.070
Why are you samurai...

1:45:35.130 --> 1:45:39.500
so arrogant!

1:45:50.470 --> 1:45:52.750
Higuchi, you okay?

1:45:54.730 --> 1:45:56.320
Thanks.

1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.270
Hioki!

1:46:58.950 --> 1:47:00.440
Hioki...

1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:06.030
You fought well. A true samurai.

1:47:10.450 --> 1:47:11.570
Shinzaemon.

1:47:15.030 --> 1:47:16.250
Higuchi!

1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:03.200
- Go!
- Finish the job.

1:48:04.550 --> 1:48:05.980
Ishizuka!

1:48:15.690 --> 1:48:17.370
Ishizuka!

1:48:25.290 --> 1:48:26.740
Otake...

1:48:28.830 --> 1:48:31.570
Our mission...

1:48:32.770 --> 1:48:35.920
finish it!

1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:45.000
Shinzaemon!

1:49:28.910 --> 1:49:30.120
Mitsuhashi!

1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:42.630
Damn!

1:49:49.950 --> 1:49:51.170
Mitsuhashi!

1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:53.820
You fool!

1:50:58.180 --> 1:50:59.300
Hanbei...

1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:04.270
You think the age of war was like this?

1:51:05.250 --> 1:51:06.770
Perhaps.

1:51:08.740 --> 1:51:10.730
It's magnificent.

1:51:14.260 --> 1:51:17.420
With death comes gratitude for life.

1:51:18.810 --> 1:51:23.540
If a man has lived in vain,
then how trivial his life is.

1:51:26.890 --> 1:51:28.890
Oh, Hanbei.

1:51:30.190 --> 1:51:32.190
Something wonderful has come to my mind.

1:51:35.100 --> 1:51:37.540
Once I'm on the Shogun's council,

1:51:38.450 --> 1:51:41.570
let's bring back the age of war.

1:52:29.180 --> 1:52:32.770
I'm Kuranaga Saheita.

1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:35.520
Lord Naritsugu...

1:52:36.190 --> 1:52:39.140
I've come for your life.

1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:43.280
Sir Hanbei...

1:52:44.510 --> 1:52:47.720
protect our Lord.

1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:21.070
Kuranaga!

1:54:10.430 --> 1:54:11.490
My Lord!

1:56:37.650 --> 1:56:40.400
Master...

1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:07.550
Who are you?

1:57:09.290 --> 1:57:10.920
Kito Hanbei.

1:57:50.130 --> 1:57:52.040
Who are you?

1:57:55.070 --> 1:57:56.970
You're no samurai!

1:57:57.170 --> 1:57:58.840
So what.

1:58:05.900 --> 1:58:08.030
Do only samurai matter in this world?

1:58:14.250 --> 1:58:16.580
I thought samurai would be fun...

1:58:18.370 --> 1:58:20.410
but you bore me.

1:58:21.310 --> 1:58:23.980
You're useless.

1:58:24.900 --> 1:58:27.050
Even more useless in great numbers.

1:58:47.540 --> 1:58:50.010
This man speaks the truth.

1:58:50.400 --> 1:58:52.960
His reward is my short sword.

1:58:54.910 --> 1:58:57.960
If we can get past that...

1:58:58.950 --> 1:59:02.810
Remain focused. Victory is ours!

1:59:03.220 --> 1:59:06.060
Keep our Lord safe. We'll win!

1:59:52.830 --> 1:59:54.030
My Lord!

1:59:55.400 --> 1:59:56.970
Let's run.

1:59:59.060 --> 2:00:03.210
Hanbei, victory is not yet ours.

2:00:18.260 --> 2:00:19.610
Shinza.

2:00:28.110 --> 2:00:31.470
Hanbei, I have no qualms with you.

2:00:34.140 --> 2:00:35.540
You will not pass.

2:00:36.700 --> 2:00:40.280
I'll trade my life to protect my Lord.

2:00:42.710 --> 2:00:45.230
I must do what must be done.

2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:51.360
Are you so hungry for my Lord's life?

2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:52.390
Yes!

2:00:54.610 --> 2:01:00.890
I gambled my life in this
senseless war of power and politics.

2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.510
If he joins the Shogun's council...

2:01:06.300 --> 2:01:12.630
you know disaster
will befall the people!

2:01:12.670 --> 2:01:13.760
Am I wrong?

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:15.290
So what then?

2:01:16.990 --> 2:01:20.030
Both you and I were born samurai.

2:01:20.790 --> 2:01:22.720
Ours is not to wonder why.

2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:24.200
Ours is...

2:01:25.370 --> 2:01:28.170
to obey our fate and die.

2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:32.750
If you were my ally...

2:01:32.980 --> 2:01:37.040
if you were not an Akashi retainer...

2:01:38.890 --> 2:01:41.060
wouldn't our task be easier?

2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:42.610
Don't lecture me!

2:01:43.950 --> 2:01:47.570
No matter how low I go,
Hanbei Kito is a samurai!

2:01:48.570 --> 2:01:51.990
I won't hand over my
Lord's head so easily.

2:01:59.910 --> 2:02:01.340
Shinza...

2:02:03.530 --> 2:02:06.820
to pass, you'll have to kill me.

2:02:13.800 --> 2:02:16.000
That I shall do.

2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:18.820
Fight!

2:02:30.380 --> 2:02:33.190
Such elegance in
fighting one-on-one.

2:03:17.250 --> 2:03:19.940
How I missed crossing swords with you!

2:03:26.460 --> 2:03:27.950
Hanbei...

2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:33.100
in the dojo, we were an even match.

2:03:47.470 --> 2:03:48.870
Hanbei...

2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:52.980
see you in Hell!

2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:29.610
Some call it elegance.

2:04:30.260 --> 2:04:33.680
Some call it cruel and unfair.

2:04:35.060 --> 2:04:36.540
I like it.

2:05:06.710 --> 2:05:10.290
How could you kick his head?

2:05:11.890 --> 2:05:13.760
He gave his life for you!

2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:18.480
Kick my head if you want.

2:05:27.470 --> 2:05:33.130
For the Shogun, for the people,
for the many who died untimely deaths...

2:05:33.380 --> 2:05:35.680
for Makino Uneme and his wife...

2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:39.620
for his father Makino Yukie...

2:05:41.460 --> 2:05:44.830
and for my men scattering Ochiai.

2:05:45.940 --> 2:05:47.350
For that...

2:05:48.780 --> 2:05:51.830
innocent, nameless young girl...

2:05:52.960 --> 2:05:55.430
with severed arms and legs...

2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:00.750
I shall take your life!

2:06:02.430 --> 2:06:04.200
Ruling is convenient...

2:06:05.080 --> 2:06:07.820
but only for rulers.

2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:11.710
The people must live to serve.

2:06:14.370 --> 2:06:19.980
Even so, a time comes when servants
rise up against their masters.

2:06:23.720 --> 2:06:26.600
You're on top thanks to
support from the bottom.

2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:29.740
Don't you see?

2:06:38.410 --> 2:06:41.860
Your mistake is believing that

2:06:42.350 --> 2:06:45.150
your decorative blade
is not just for show.

2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:50.560
Nonsense. It's not for show!

2:06:51.560 --> 2:06:53.960
Decoration is for show.

2:06:55.780 --> 2:06:59.640
Be silent like the
decorative man you are.

2:07:02.500 --> 2:07:04.270
Servant!

2:07:09.050 --> 2:07:11.510
How is this for show?

2:07:37.550 --> 2:07:38.570
Uncle!

2:07:44.770 --> 2:07:45.920
Pain!

2:07:59.230 --> 2:08:00.450
It hurts!

2:08:03.830 --> 2:08:05.680
That's unexpected.

2:08:06.980 --> 2:08:09.360
Can you feel pain?

2:08:11.500 --> 2:08:14.230
Am I dying?

2:08:16.350 --> 2:08:17.530
Dying?

2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:28.260
I'm scared. So scared.

2:08:28.470 --> 2:08:29.620
Scared.

2:08:35.180 --> 2:08:36.640
I don't want...

2:08:39.630 --> 2:08:41.030
to die.

2:08:46.490 --> 2:08:48.090
I'm scared.

2:09:02.970 --> 2:09:04.640
My Lord...

2:09:05.390 --> 2:09:07.490
prepare yourself!

2:09:11.950 --> 2:09:16.260
So death comes for us all.

2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:28.040
Allow me to thank you, Shinzaemon.

2:09:38.220 --> 2:09:40.220
Of all the days of my life,

2:09:41.780 --> 2:09:44.510
today has been the most exciting.

2:09:48.830 --> 2:09:50.030
You're welcome!

2:10:02.140 --> 2:10:03.530
It's over.

2:10:09.210 --> 2:10:11.580
The big gamble paid off.

2:10:19.430 --> 2:10:21.040
Shinrokuro...

2:10:23.630 --> 2:10:25.640
being a samurai...

2:10:27.670 --> 2:10:31.620
is truly a burden.

2:10:38.130 --> 2:10:39.750
Do what you want...

2:10:42.690 --> 2:10:44.350
with your life.

2:12:22.620 --> 2:12:24.650
Are you immortal?

2:12:26.260 --> 2:12:29.220
You got the Lord's head without me?

2:12:30.970 --> 2:12:32.880
Our fight is over.

2:12:35.090 --> 2:12:36.680
That ain't no fun.

2:12:39.110 --> 2:12:40.520
You hurt?

2:12:43.300 --> 2:12:48.550
Compared to fighting a wild
bear, these wounds are nothing.

2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:53.810
All in all...

2:12:55.900 --> 2:12:58.040
I want my Upashi.

2:13:03.020 --> 2:13:06.040
I don't like towns
swarming with samurai.

2:13:07.300 --> 2:13:10.770
I'll go home, sweep
Upashi off her feet...

2:13:11.580 --> 2:13:13.820
and live far away!

2:13:15.470 --> 2:13:17.010
Live your life.

2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:21.870
Till the next life!

2:13:29.050 --> 2:13:30.540
What are you going to do?

2:13:34.150 --> 2:13:37.780
Whatever I want. Been
a samurai long enough.

2:13:39.910 --> 2:13:42.380
Become a bandit.

2:13:42.850 --> 2:13:48.520
The greatest bandit in Japan. Jump
ship to America, make love to women.

2:13:50.710 --> 2:13:52.280
Now you're talking.

2:13:54.530 --> 2:13:56.490
Say 'hi' to Upashi for me.

2:14:01.580 --> 2:14:02.840
Sure.

2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:38.410
<i>In May 1844,</i>

2:16:38.410 --> 2:16:43.390
<i>it was reported to the
Central Government...</i>

2:16:43.390 --> 2:16:46.510
<i>that Lord Naritsugu fell ill and died.</i>

2:16:47.890 --> 2:16:50.300
<i>Some 23 years later,</i>

2:16:50.300 --> 2:16:52.640
<i>the Shogunate system was abolished.</i>

2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:55.250
<i>The modern Meiji era began.</i>
