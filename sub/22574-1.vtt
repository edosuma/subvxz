There you go.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.464
You do realize,

01:05.498 --> 01:07.833
we've past half a dozen
coffee places to get here?

01:07.902 --> 01:09.268
And some of them

01:09.303 --> 01:11.470
you can actually sit inside
where it's warm.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.745
This is the best coffee
in town.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.473
Sure.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.675
What's a little frost bite
for the sake of good coffee?

01:16.744 --> 01:18.310
I just love this time of year.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.979
Everyone getting ready
for the Christmas Festival.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.649
Setting up decorations.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.462
You may have mentioned that
once or twice over the years

01:25.486 --> 01:26.452
since we were kids?

01:26.487 --> 01:28.954
Didn't want you to forget.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.722
Hey,

01:30.758 --> 01:33.559
shouldn't they be setting up for
that ice sculpture competition?

01:33.594 --> 01:36.728
There's still a couple weeks
before the festivals starts.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.230
That's not a lot of time.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.876
I mean, they still have to
register the contestants,

01:39.900 --> 01:41.600
approve their designs.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.947
And you wouldn't believe all the
ice that has to get trucked in.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.771
I see law school

01:45.806 --> 01:47.918
hasn't put a damper on your
passion for ice sculpting.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.475
I've missed working with my Dad.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.277
We haven't got to sculpt
together in three years.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.713
(phone chiming)
Oh.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.883
Yep. I got to go.

01:57.918 --> 01:58.984
Let's do dinner tonight.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.385
I can't tonight.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.887
I promised the folks.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.822
But I'll text you
and we'll set up a day.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.958
Say hi to your mom for me.
I will.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.062
Carol:
Uh-huh.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.397
Well, I will speak to the Judge

02:12.433 --> 02:14.233
and see if we can
move your hearing.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.135
But we only have a couple weeks
'til Christmas,

02:16.170 --> 02:18.937
I'm afraid it might already
be too late.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.206
Sorry. I met Sarah for coffee.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.810
Ms. Kincaid, can you just
hold for just a moment please?

02:24.879 --> 02:26.957
Who handles Judge Pettis'
schedule over at the courthouse?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.959
Ms. Kincaid needs to
push her hearing back and I...

02:28.983 --> 02:30.549
June Whalen.
June.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.451
Let me talk to her.
Oh, okay.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.452
Ms. Kincaid?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.053
Hi, it's Emma.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.489
Let me see what I can do
and I'll get right back to you.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.125
Thanks. Merry Christmas. Bye.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.261
Give me 10 minutes.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.932
Take a look at these,

02:46.967 --> 02:48.734
I red-lined the changes
for your approval,

02:48.769 --> 02:49.880
I can have a final draft ready
for signatures in the morning.

02:49.904 --> 02:52.237
Great. And Ms. Kincaid?

02:52.273 --> 02:54.773
The Judge had an opening
two weeks after the holidays.

02:54.808 --> 02:55.774
We're all set.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.609
Thank you, Emma.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.911
We make a great team.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.212
Yes, we do.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.580
And it's going to
get even better

03:01.615 --> 03:03.382
once we get the results
of your bar exam.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.950
Assuming I pass.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.119
Half the people fail
the first time they take it.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.054
Those people are not
Emma Parkers.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.390
And with that resounding
vote of confidence,

03:11.425 --> 03:12.758
I'll get back to work.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.304
Oh, dinner tonight at seven.
Is that okay?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.195
I'll be there.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.965
Oh, hey... what's going on with
the Ice Sculpting Competition?

03:20.034 --> 03:21.934
I don't know. What do you mean?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.202
I was at the park with Sarah,

03:23.237 --> 03:24.903
they haven't started
setting up yet.

03:24.939 --> 03:28.974
They put Harvey Norris in charge
of the Festival this year.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.976
And it is his first term
on Town Council.

03:31.045 --> 03:34.112
So, he's probably just in
a little over his head.

03:34.148 --> 03:37.082
You're probably right.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.251
There's a lot to do
with the the Festival.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.571
(sighing)

04:03.711 --> 04:04.643
Can I help you?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.245
Oh, hey. Hi.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.615
No, I'm just, you know,
browsing.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.450
Uh, what do you think?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.285
It's beautiful.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.254
Yeah?
Good choice.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.289
Well, thank you.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.602
See anything you like?

04:30.638 --> 04:34.139
Actually, I do.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.375
This is... beautiful.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.376
Who did this?

04:37.411 --> 04:40.445
Uh, my brother.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.613
You should put it out front,

04:41.682 --> 04:44.349
it'll really help
draw in a crowd.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.752
Yeah, you know, he's not really
into showing them off.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.856
Oh. Well, I've been ice
sculpting since I was little

04:50.891 --> 04:52.591
and this is really good.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.960
I'll tell him you said so.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.031
There used to be a Claiborne
Tree Farms outside of town.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.799
Mmm-hmm.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.369
This nice couple ran it and they
always gave me this candy cane

05:04.405 --> 05:06.571
every time we did
our Christmas tree.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.773
Those were my folks.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.940
No kidding.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.742
Yeah, one and the same.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.578
They, uh, they retired last year
and I took over the business.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.047
I'm Nick Claiborne.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.282
Hi. Emma Parkers.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.551
It's nice to meet you.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.687
And the candy cane thing,
that was my idea.

05:21.722 --> 05:25.891
Clearly you had a head for
business even at a young age.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.460
I just really like candy canes.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.729
(laughing)

05:31.865 --> 05:35.067
Listen, about before...

05:35.102 --> 05:38.537
I don't know, there's just
something about these trees

05:38.572 --> 05:41.239
that Christmas smell,
I can't resist.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.020
That's not the first time
I've heard that.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.911
(laughing)

05:45.946 --> 05:48.580
Browse to your heart's content.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.116
Thanks.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.352
I got to go.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.354
You got to go.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.355
See you around.
Yeah.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.290
Oh.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.892
Hey.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.961
Merry Christmas.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.833
Merry Christmas.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.501
(sighing)

06:42.536 --> 06:46.438
I can't believe they cancelled
the ice sculpting competition.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.174
They don't call it Christmas
Festival of Ice for nothing.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.710
I mean, people in Westford
have been sculpting ice here

06:51.745 --> 06:52.711
since practically forever.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.346
I mean, it's the reason

06:54.381 --> 06:56.448
the whole festival got started
in the first place.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.916
You've been gone.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.118
Okay, but I come home
every year for Christmas

07:00.187 --> 07:02.320
and there's always
ice sculptures in the park.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.889
Well, the last few years

07:03.924 --> 07:05.857
the festival hasn't drawn
as well as it used to.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.559
Yeah, and I don't know why

07:07.594 --> 07:09.739
people don't want to come
all this way to sit in the cold

07:09.763 --> 07:11.741
and watch your father chip away
at big chunks of ice.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.064
Hey.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.933
I love it.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.002
Okay, but those ice sculptures
are works of art.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.838
Oh, unfortunately they are
becoming a lost art.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.174
I just... I can't believe it.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.177
Oh, did you tell Emma
your big news?

07:25.212 --> 07:28.680
The, um, county has
officially chosen my design

07:28.715 --> 07:30.749
for the new library branch.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.551
Dad! That's great!

07:32.586 --> 07:34.853
Isn't that wonderful?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.322
So once you get the results
of your bar exam

07:37.357 --> 07:40.025
we will all have something
special to celebrate

07:40.060 --> 07:43.695
this Christmas.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.763
To the Parkers.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.731
To a new design,
to a new lawyer,

07:46.767 --> 07:48.934
and I get a new partner.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.569
Hear, hear.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.871
(glasses clinking)

07:58.512 --> 08:01.046
I almost finished
carving the new model.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.414
What do you think?

08:02.483 --> 08:05.750
Too bad we don't get to
see it full-size.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.864
I was looking forward to getting
the Parkers family team

08:07.888 --> 08:10.055
back together too.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.496
Why does this bother me so much?

08:17.531 --> 08:20.932
Well.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.367
It's been a part of your life

08:22.402 --> 08:24.402
for as long as
you could remember.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.550
When other kids were learning
to skate on ice

08:27.574 --> 08:29.641
you were learning to carve it.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.647
Yeah, well...

08:35.682 --> 08:38.850
Mom's right, I should be focused
on my career right now.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.219
It's what you said
you always wanted.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.419
Be a lawyer.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.188
I know.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.991
You worked very hard
to make it happen.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.592
Then how come
all I can think about

08:47.661 --> 08:49.101
are some of the best times
of my life

08:49.162 --> 08:51.830
were spent carving
these sculptures?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.865
That is a good question.

08:53.901 --> 08:57.235
I feel some fatherly advice
coming on.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.973
You know me so well.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.145
Dug these out the other day.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.015
Thought you were
going to need them.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.885
My tools.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.554
Why don't you take them out?

09:15.589 --> 09:17.889
See if you still got the chops.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.894
You don't mind?

09:22.963 --> 09:27.966
Like I said,
it'll give you time to think.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.068
Thanks, Dad.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.071
(ice chipping)

10:13.213 --> 10:15.547
Hi, I'm here
to see Harvey Norris.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.315
Oh, he's not in yet.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.717
Schedule's been pretty crazy,

10:18.785 --> 10:19.718
what, with the
Christmas Festival and all.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.997
Actually I wanted to talk to him

10:21.021 --> 10:22.265
about the ice sculpture
competition.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.489
Oh, that's been cancelled.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.625
I know.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.228
Could you just tell him that
Emma Parkers stopped by?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.674
Ask him to give me a call?
That's my number.

10:31.698 --> 10:32.664
I sure will.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.132
Merry Christmas.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.167
You too.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.873
Vera:
And what I'd like to do is set
up some sort of small endowment

10:41.908 --> 10:44.409
or a scholarship at the college.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.244
Put it in Sam's name.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.180
Kind of a Christmas present
for my husband.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.017
Aw, Vera,
that's a wonderful idea.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.019
Well, he taught there
for almost 30 years.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.020
Carol:
Sure.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.132
I think he would've liked that.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.689
Mmm-hmm. Emma?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.164
Why don't you give
the school a call?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.893
Find out who we should talk to
to set this up.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.294
I'll call right now.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.864
Great.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.733
Good idea, Vera.
That's a really lovely idea.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.235
Hi, this is Emma Parkers.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.904
I was in this morning
to see Harvey Norris.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.707
Oh, he's still not in?

11:15.776 --> 11:18.309
No, I understand that he's
very busy with the festival

11:18.345 --> 11:20.545
but I just...

11:20.614 --> 11:22.681
Could you let him know
that I called?

11:22.716 --> 11:23.716
Thanks.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.784
They'll call back.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.824
Emma?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.060
Sam and Vera
were clients of mine

11:35.128 --> 11:37.829
from almost the very first day
I started this practice.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.030
I remember.

11:39.066 --> 11:43.835
And now that he's gone...

11:43.870 --> 11:46.204
this endowment
means a lot to her.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.373
We're a small firm.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.509
We need to give
every client 100%.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.346
I couldn't agree more.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.549
You're going to
make a great lawyer.

12:03.824 --> 12:09.694
<i>♪</i>

12:23.977 --> 12:27.045
Oh, those are great. We'll take
10 for City Hall please.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.980
Excuse me, Councilman Norris?

12:29.015 --> 12:30.849
Sure, yeah.
Call me Harvey.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.550
Hi, Harvey.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.786
Emma Parkers.
I'm Carol Parkers' daughter.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.020
Oh, sure. Hi, Emma.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.455
How's your mom?
Great.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.491
I was hoping you have a minute.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.925
I don't think it's a good idea

12:40.961 --> 12:42.138
to cancel the ice sculpting
competition.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.695
I didn't want to.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.408
But we didn't have the budget
for it this year.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.332
It was either
cancel the competition

12:47.367 --> 12:48.933
or lose Santa's Workshop.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.436
And I don't want to get on
Santa's naughty list.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.704
No. But you grew up here,

12:52.773 --> 12:54.150
you know how important
the festival is

12:54.174 --> 12:55.707
to the people in Westford.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.942
I sure do. I'm a big fan myself.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.344
There must be something
you can do.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.345
I'm sorry, Emma.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.381
I'm afraid my hands are tied.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.116
What if I could raise the money?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.551
Excuse me?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.164
To make up for the difference
in your budget.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.021
To pay for the competition.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.823
$20,000 in less than two weeks?

13:11.858 --> 13:13.124
$20,000?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.359
I'm afraid so.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.295
Oh. Wow.
What if I could raise half?

13:17.330 --> 13:21.199
Well, we can't exactly have
half a sculpting competition.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.934
No, I mean,

13:22.969 --> 13:23.980
but maybe you could come up
with the money somewhere?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.336
Squeeze your budget a little?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.505
You're serious about this?

13:27.541 --> 13:29.140
It's really important to me.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.875
And to the town.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.189
I mean, it's been a part of the
festival for so many years.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.147
If you could just give me a
chance, that's all I ask.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.351
I guess if I squeeze my nickels
a little bit.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.754
I could come up with maybe...

13:42.789 --> 13:45.089
$5,000.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.090
But you'd have to
raise the rest.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.759
$15,000?

13:47.794 --> 13:49.761
That's the best I can do.

13:49.796 --> 13:50.796
It's a deal.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.297
(chuckling)

13:52.332 --> 13:53.631
Good luck, Emma.

What a beautiful morning.

Hey, what brings you out?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.025
Just going for a walk,
grabbing a coffee.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.795
Best coffee in town,
worth the walk.

14:23.830 --> 14:24.796
Yeah.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.431
I was just thinking.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.810
My parents used to bring me
here every Christmas.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.101
You know,
to watch the sculpting.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.102

Yeah.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.470
When I was old enough

14:32.505 --> 14:35.273
my dad and I used to compete
every Christmas.

You competed?
Yeah.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.275
Yeah.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.910
It was a lot of fun.

14:38.945 --> 14:43.248
Wow. So, I probably
saw you competing.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.817
Maybe we saw each other.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.019
Maybe.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.923
But it's too bad that they have
to cancel it this year.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.691

have the money for it.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.460

14:55.495 --> 14:57.629
Yeah, I heard that too.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.098
That's why I decided to
raise the money myself.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.834
Wait, what?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.636
Yeah. I'm going to...

15:04.671 --> 15:06.938
raise the money,
put the competition back on.

15:06.973 --> 15:10.942
And how much money
are we talking?

15:10.977 --> 15:13.144

We try to keep an eye on him
but sometimes he wanders off

I hope he hasn't been
too exasperating.

Come by anytime.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.617
Thank you.

We've known each other
since we were kids.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.622
You know, he gets a little jolly
this time of year.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.457
I'm the same way.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.894
Hey, feel free to sniff around
while you're here.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.101
Hey, I hope it works out.

You could introduce me
to your brother.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.675
My brother...

16:17.744 --> 16:19.277
Right. Why?

16:19.312 --> 16:22.814
Well, I was just thinking
maybe I could ask him

16:22.849 --> 16:24.716
to use some of his
ice sculptures

16:24.751 --> 16:25.928
to help promote the competition.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.819
You know, get people
excited again.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.554
Yeah. I don't know about that.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.056
Was he planning to enter
the competition?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.058
No.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.226
No, he'd never do that.
No?

16:35.261 --> 16:36.728
Why?

16:36.763 --> 16:40.598
He's... he's very busy
at this time of year.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.101
And, um...

16:43.136 --> 16:45.470
he's, uh...

16:45.505 --> 16:47.071
he's not really
great with people.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.974
Well, we're going to
need a lot of sculptors.

16:50.010 --> 16:54.612
So, I don't know, maybe I could
get in contact with him?

16:55.915 --> 16:58.216
Yeah.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.551
I'm sorry, Emma.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.121
I wish I could help.

said about hoping it works out?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.493
Hey, I do hope it works out.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.662
Right. No.

Uh, yeah.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.569
Emma.
You know what?

17:18.605 --> 17:21.739
I got some paperwork I got to

Merry Christmas.

Yeah, Merry Christmas.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.052
That's right,

17:34.087 --> 17:35.197
we'll be taking the depositions
for the Simmons case

17:35.221 --> 17:36.754
right here in office.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.322
Yeah, it's a pretty big case

17:38.391 --> 17:40.925

the stenographer all day.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.630
Um, no, they're driving down
from Concord.

I've known these sculpting folks
forever, believe me,

they're going to ask.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.361
When you were teaching me
to sculpt

22:10.430 --> 22:12.997
you used to tell me to keep
my mind on the big picture

Season's Greetings.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.135
Christmas cookie latte.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.770
Aw, Emma, thank you.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.105
It's the least I could do

22:54.140 --> 22:56.173
after being gone
for so long yesterday.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.842
Oh, all is forgiven.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.411
The thing is there's just
so much going on right now

23:00.446 --> 23:02.947
I feel like I'm being pulled
in 10 different directions.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.850
I know, I have barely started
my Christmas shopping.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.663
And with the Christmas Festival
coming up and everything...

23:07.687 --> 23:10.321
Well, we'll muddle through
somehow.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.658
Speaking of muddling through,
you'll appreciate this.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.460
Oh, sorry.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.073
I almost forgot to tell you
while you were out yesterday.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.997
They called from Concord
about the Simmons case.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.665
Good, I need to
confirm the stenographer.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.612
What time are they going to be
here for the depositions?

23:23.636 --> 23:26.570
They can't. Opposing counsel
slipped on some ice

23:26.606 --> 23:29.940
and has twisted her ankle and,
I mean, she'll be fine,

23:29.976 --> 23:32.276
but she's requested
that we come there instead.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.578
And, you know,
I'd rather not delay this.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.515
So I said, "No problem."

23:37.583 --> 23:40.451
So you're going to drive
to the capital next week?

23:40.486 --> 23:43.154
We get to drive to the capital
together.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.789
What?!

23:44.824 --> 23:46.235
You've done all the
heavy lifting with this case,

23:46.259 --> 23:47.958
you know the issues,

23:47.994 --> 23:50.528
you should be the one
asking the questions.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.696
I, um...

23:52.765 --> 23:54.632
Wow.
I know, right?

23:54.667 --> 23:56.467
It's a big step
but I think you're ready.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.335
So we'll be gone
for two days next week?

23:58.404 --> 23:59.404
Is that a problem?

23:59.439 --> 24:02.673
No. Um, no, no problem.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.809
I just thought maybe with
everything going on here

24:04.844 --> 24:07.178
I should stick around.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.291
Honey, I think Westford can get
along without you for two days.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.515
(sighing)

24:27.800 --> 24:30.167
It's not even making a dent.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.002
Sarah:
<i>Emma, these things take time.</i>

24:32.071 --> 24:34.939
Yeah, well I just found out I
have less time than I thought.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.440
What do you mean?

24:36.476 --> 24:38.242
<i>My mom wants me to
handle the depositions</i>

24:38.277 --> 24:39.777
on one of our cases,

24:39.812 --> 24:42.480
so I'll be in the capital
for two days next week.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.748
But that's when
the festival starts.

24:44.784 --> 24:45.749
<i>I know.</i>

24:45.785 --> 24:47.351
So I need to make sure

24:47.420 --> 24:49.298
a lot more people know about
the campaign and fast.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.088
<i>How are you going to do that?</i>

24:51.123 --> 24:52.656
Go straight to the source.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.792
Sounds like a plan.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.228
(bell ringing)

25:02.301 --> 25:03.712
Please tell me you're not here
for more money,

25:03.736 --> 25:05.903
I've squeezed every penny I can
from my budget.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.339
I just have one tiny favour.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.107
What's that?

25:10.142 --> 25:13.777
People all over the country look
at Westford's Christmas website.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.613
I think if you linked it
to my campaign page

25:15.648 --> 25:18.482
we might have a better chance
to raise the money in time.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.585
Emma, when I brought this up
with the rest of the council

25:21.621 --> 25:23.153
everybody talked about

25:23.222 --> 25:25.100
all of their fond memories
from the competition.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.790
Well, that's great.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.437
But the truth is,
they're a little worried too.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.327
What do you mean?

25:30.396 --> 25:31.740
They don't want to
get the town's hopes up

25:31.764 --> 25:32.730
that we can bring
the competition back

25:32.765 --> 25:35.466
and then have it...

25:35.501 --> 25:36.767
well, have it not work out.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.336
It's Christmas time.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.639
The last thing we want to do
is disappoint anybody.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.776
You're right, Harvey,
it is Christmas.

25:45.811 --> 25:48.379
The time when miracles
really do happen.

25:48.414 --> 25:51.949
And who knows, maybe we can make
our own little Christmas miracle

25:51.984 --> 25:54.118
happen right here in Westford.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.132
Well, you definitely
have a way with words.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.034
Maybe you can come and
work with us at the town.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.224
We've got some other miracles

26:00.259 --> 26:01.436
that we could use
some help with.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.627
Is that a yes?

26:06.065 --> 26:09.133
I never wanted to cancel the
competition in the first place.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.467
I'll get you the link.

26:10.503 --> 26:12.503
Thank you, Harvey.

Hi. Emma.

Ms. Baxter, hi.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.709
I didn't know you worked here.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.444
Oh, I volunteer
a couple of days a week.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.057
Gets me out of the house
since I retired.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.692
Oh, by the way, I have
a call in to the college

26:56.716 --> 27:00.017
about setting up the endowment
in your husband's name.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.252
I'm sure that they'll love it.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.620
Oh, I hope so.

27:02.688 --> 27:03.732
But, tell me,
what brings you here today?

27:03.756 --> 27:06.624
Oh, I saw on
the museum's website

27:06.692 --> 27:08.092
you have some old photographs

27:08.127 --> 27:10.060
from past ice sculpting
competitions.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.028
Uh huh.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.074
Could I maybe look at them?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.665
Right this way.
Oh, great.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.836
I've been watching them
carve ice since I was a girl.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.705
Oh, it never ceases to amaze me.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.240
Shame it all has to end.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.508
Actually, that's why I'm here.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.577
To try and keep that
from happening.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.179
But I thought Harvey'd already
cancelled the competition.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.525
Well, if I can raise the money
in time

27:30.549 --> 27:32.116
he'll put it back
in the festival.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.184
I thought maybe some of
these old photographs

27:34.220 --> 27:37.054
might help remind people of
what a great tradition it is.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.357
You're welcome to
whatever you need.

Our client, Miss Simmons,

27:46.532 --> 27:50.200
received notice that her car was
part of a manufacturer recall.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.980
But when she took it in
the dealership said that

27:52.004 --> 27:54.082
they were too busy and asked her
to bring it back the next week.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.706
Be sure when you ask that

27:55.741 --> 27:59.176
they specify in their answer
what day of the week.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.911
Because Monday was a holiday

28:00.946 --> 28:03.247
and Miss Simmons couldn't
come back until Tuesday.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.282
Good.
Great.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.552
I don't know,

28:08.587 --> 28:10.532
I guess I just feel guilty for
not telling her what I'm doing.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.322
Then tell her.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.092
Your mom knows how much you've
always loved ice sculpting.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.505
Yeah, well I can love it
all I want

28:16.529 --> 28:19.063
as long as the law
always comes first.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.098
And that's why you went to
school for three years

28:21.167 --> 28:23.100
to become a lawyer, isn't it?

28:23.169 --> 28:25.269
That was the plan.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.404
You okay?

28:27.440 --> 28:30.607
Yeah. No. I just, um...

28:30.676 --> 28:33.610
the whole thing with raising
money for the competition.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.913
Actually, I should
check to see if...

28:35.981 --> 28:37.514
No, what you should do

28:37.550 --> 28:40.217
is stop checking contributions
every two minutes.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.563
I brought you along to help me

Who's Nick?

Christmas tree lot and I asked...

You know what? Never mind.

Can we just go
somewhere else please?

No way. Look at this place.

Good choice.

popular tree this time of year.

Do you, uh, have someone to
help you carry it to the car?

I was just admiring it, it's
way too big for my apartment.

It's what I tell everybody.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.116
What? Why?

It's a...

31:28.988 --> 31:31.021
it's a long and
very predictable story.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.334

31:32.358 --> 31:34.358
just saves everybody
a lot of time.

if you would let them.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.109
But, I mean,

31:52.144 --> 31:54.144
that doesn't make it okay
that you wouldn't help me

31:54.179 --> 31:57.214
when I asked for you to
save the competition with me.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.949

something to help.

tell you about that.

he's a big fan of ice sculpting
from way back.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.199
I talked to him about
what you're doing.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.624
You did?

32:40.659 --> 32:43.160
I thought maybe
he could help.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.995

33:13.692 --> 33:15.392
I don't get it.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.495
If he likes ice sculpting so
much, why keep it a secret?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.197
I don't know.

33:20.265 --> 33:23.433
I get the feeling it's about
more than just sculpting.

You two seemed to hit it off.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.337

picked up on a vibe.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.543
What?

33:33.612 --> 33:35.479
Yeah, right. There was no vibe.

keep telling yourself that.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.515
No vibe!

33:42.888 --> 33:44.321
Good luck with that.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.123
Emma!
See ya.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.457
Get back here and help me!

33:47.493 --> 33:49.593
Emma!

33:53.565 --> 34:01.565
<i>♪</i>

34:13.485 --> 34:14.985
Nick told me you were coming by

34:15.054 --> 34:16.598
and that I should listen
to what you have to say

34:16.621 --> 34:19.589
because saving this
competition's important to you.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.291
He said all that?

34:21.326 --> 34:25.094
But what he didn't say is why.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.100
My dad started teaching me
how to sculpt

34:30.135 --> 34:32.335
when I was a little girl.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.940
He and I were in the competition
for as long as I can remember.

34:38.811 --> 34:42.411
The truth is, as important as
the tradition is to the town

34:42.447 --> 34:46.049
I think it's just as important
to my family.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.485
Let me think about it.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.054
Great.

34:51.090 --> 34:54.324
Thank you.
I really appreciate it, Frank.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.559
And Merry Christmas.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.961
Merry Christmas.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.104
Dad, I didn't know you
were coming by today.

35:07.139 --> 35:08.499
I thought
I'd surprise your mother.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.873
Take her out to lunch.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.375
Well, she's in the office
on a phone call,

35:12.411 --> 35:13.755
I'm sure she'll be out
in a minute.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.613
In that case I shall share
some good news.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.381
I reached out to
some old friends,

35:18.417 --> 35:20.150
we got six teams standing by,

35:20.219 --> 35:22.285
just say the word,
they'll be here to compete.

35:22.321 --> 35:23.453
You're amazing, Dad.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.722
Thanks.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.124
What's up?

35:27.159 --> 35:28.125
(sighing)

35:28.160 --> 35:29.926
Nothing.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.140
The festival's tomorrow and I
still haven't raised the money.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.964
Keep the faith.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.799
You never know.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.534
You never know what?

35:37.569 --> 35:42.272
I never know where I'm going to
take my beautiful wife to lunch.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.774
Hm.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.810
I'll get my coat.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.414
It ain't over 'til it's over.

36:07.099 --> 36:08.543
You know I had coffee
with Emma's friend Sarah,

36:08.567 --> 36:10.967
remember she was out at the farm
the other day.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.871
Coffee, huh?
That sounds promising.

36:14.907 --> 36:15.872
Lonny:
Yeah.

36:15.908 --> 36:18.708
Kind of hit it off.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.212
I mean, with the trees and all.

36:22.247 --> 36:24.814
Way to go, Lonny!

36:24.883 --> 36:26.449
Anyway, she was telling me about

36:26.485 --> 36:29.986
how Emma works just
a couple of blocks from here.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.733
At her mom's law office
over there on Riverton.

36:31.757 --> 36:32.956
Oh, yeah?

36:33.025 --> 36:35.058
Yeah.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.960
She seems real nice.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.930
Maybe you should, uh, stop by,
say hi.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.065
Yeah, I don't think so.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.900
Well, what are you going to do

36:43.936 --> 36:45.747
just give up on Christmas for
good because of what Tara did?

36:45.771 --> 36:48.905
Let's not go there,
all right?

36:51.777 --> 36:53.109
Whatever happened
to the old Nick?

36:53.145 --> 36:54.945
The guy who used to
like to have fun?

36:54.980 --> 36:59.382
And spent every night in his
barn carving little ice statues

36:59.418 --> 37:02.285
instead of getting on
with his life.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.258
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

37:08.293 --> 37:10.427
I miss my friend.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.297
You're missing Christmas.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.903
I don't know.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.245
See? This is a nice change...

37:28.280 --> 37:31.381
from our frostbit toes
on our way to get coffee.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.251
Thought I'd give you a break for
Christmas on your first day off.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.386
Speaking of.
You don't look very festive.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.523
I don't feel very festive.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.103
I didn't raise the money
for the competition

37:42.127 --> 37:43.860
and today's the first day
of the festival,

37:43.895 --> 37:45.795
so we're out of time.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.931
Oh, no. How close did you get?

37:47.966 --> 37:49.010
It doesn't matter,
it's all or nothing.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.767
I mean, you know,

37:50.802 --> 37:53.370
you don't raise your goal then
you don't get any of the money.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.105
What are you doing?

37:55.140 --> 37:56.806
I'd still like to know.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.074
Sarah, come on.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.075
When was the last time
you checked?

37:59.111 --> 38:00.076
Does it matter?

38:00.112 --> 38:01.278
Emma.

38:01.346 --> 38:02.412
Yes?

38:02.447 --> 38:05.348
Look.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.952
An anonymous donor?

38:09.021 --> 38:10.720
For almost $10,000!

38:10.756 --> 38:12.122
He did it.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.456
Frank Duvall did it!

38:13.525 --> 38:14.525
You did it!

38:14.559 --> 38:17.260
We did it!
(squealing)

38:19.598 --> 38:21.598
Little more volume please.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.934
Um, Merry Christmas and
God bless us, everyone.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.671
Testing, one, two, testing.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.339
One, two.

38:29.374 --> 38:30.907
Harvey!
Harvey, we got the money!

38:30.942 --> 38:31.908
We did it!

38:31.943 --> 38:33.376
15?!

38:33.412 --> 38:34.577
$15,000?

38:34.613 --> 38:36.179
I know, it's unbelievable!

38:36.214 --> 38:38.081
It sounds like
you got your miracle!

38:38.116 --> 38:39.360
We have to get ready,
tell everybody to set it up.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.084
Absolutely.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.064
But where are we going to find
teams at the last minute?

38:43.088 --> 38:45.689
Don't worry, my dad's got
six teams standing by,

38:45.724 --> 38:48.024
seven including us.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.592
You did it, Emma.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.761
You did it.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.129
Yes.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.532
The ice sculpting competition
is back!

38:55.567 --> 38:56.900
Merry Christmas.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.536
Merry Christmas.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.671
Wow.

39:04.910 --> 39:05.875
Nick!

39:05.911 --> 39:07.510
We did it.

39:07.546 --> 39:08.589
We raised the money and the
competition's back on.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.947
Oh.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.048
Sorry.

39:12.084 --> 39:14.684
Wow. That's... that's amazing.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.685
Yeah.

39:15.721 --> 39:16.953
Yeah. Way to go, Emma.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.366
Congratulations.
I owe it all to Nick.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.789
What?

39:19.858 --> 39:21.069
Yeah. I mean,
you sent me to Frank Duvall,

39:21.093 --> 39:22.992
I told him what we needed

39:23.028 --> 39:24.948
and he made a donation
for the rest of the money.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.496
Wow.
Yeah.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.343
Whoa. I always knew Frank
was a good guy but...

39:28.367 --> 39:29.899
No, you are the great guy.

39:29.935 --> 39:33.069
None of this would've happened
without your help.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.905
Honestly, thank you.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.007
I'm glad it worked out.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.410
Well, um...

39:40.445 --> 39:44.280
you know, there are
seven teams lined up.

39:44.349 --> 39:48.218
Which means there's still room
for one more.

39:48.253 --> 39:52.222
Yeah, no, Emma, it gets
really busy around here

39:52.257 --> 39:54.190
around Christmas. You know?

39:54.226 --> 39:56.826
What I do I know
about big sculptures?

39:59.231 --> 40:01.364
Anyway, you have fun.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.400
And, uh, congratulations.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.735
Thanks.
Excuse me.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.037
Hey. I'll see you later.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.006
Yeah.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.608
(sighing)

40:11.676 --> 40:14.444
Look, Nick should be talking
to you about this, not me,

40:14.513 --> 40:16.446
but I know him.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.859
And I can tell
how much he likes you.

40:17.883 --> 40:21.317
Hm. He's got a funny way
of showing it.

40:21.353 --> 40:23.186
Yeah, well that's what people do

40:23.221 --> 40:25.922
when they get their heart ripped
out by someone they care about,

40:25.991 --> 40:28.358
especially when it happens
at Christmas.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.227
What?

40:31.263 --> 40:34.197
Just, uh...

40:34.232 --> 40:36.599
hang in there.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.894
Emma:
Hi, it's Emma Parkers.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.263
Is Frank in?

41:07.332 --> 41:09.566
Oh, no. Could I leave a message?

41:09.601 --> 41:11.234
Yeah.
Could you just let him know

41:11.269 --> 41:13.670
I called to thank him
for his generous contribution?

41:15.574 --> 41:17.474
No, he'll know what I mean.

41:17.509 --> 41:18.842
Thanks. You too.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.177
Merry Christmas.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.436
<i>♪</i>

41:46.471 --> 41:48.938
(knocking)

41:50.775 --> 41:51.975
Hi.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.244
Hi.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.778
Thought I might find you here.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.981
You know, it helps me think.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.818
Same here.

42:03.488 --> 42:05.466
I thought about what you said
about the competition

42:05.490 --> 42:07.790
and how it's different
because of the size.

42:07.826 --> 42:08.791
Yeah.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.159
But it's not.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.961
You shouldn't let it
stop you from competing

42:11.997 --> 42:13.474
if it's something
you really want to do.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.398
Emma, look, it's not...

42:15.433 --> 42:18.301
I mean, you shouldn't
let anything stop you,

42:18.336 --> 42:21.604
really, from anything
you care about.

42:21.640 --> 42:25.775
When you find something that you
can really put your heart into,

42:25.810 --> 42:28.344
something that you really love,

42:28.413 --> 42:32.482
you should hang on to it
as tight as you can.

42:34.319 --> 42:36.152
Sometimes you got to know
when to let go.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.754
What do you mean?

42:37.789 --> 42:40.590
Okay. Um...

42:40.625 --> 42:41.991
it's kind of like you.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.727
I started doing this
when I was pretty young.

42:44.763 --> 42:47.830
And it was like, uh...

42:47.899 --> 42:50.633
I could do it. You know?

42:50.669 --> 42:52.402
The tools just fit in my hand.

42:52.437 --> 42:56.472
I started entering some
smaller competitions

42:56.508 --> 42:57.807
and...

42:57.842 --> 42:59.976
it's never about winning,
you know.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.645
It's just because...
just because it was fun.

43:04.416 --> 43:07.550
Anyway, after a while you start
running into the same people

43:07.586 --> 43:10.086
and kind of get to know 'em.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.589
I met this girl.

43:12.624 --> 43:14.457
She was really nice.

43:14.492 --> 43:18.127
And, uh, she could
work with ice too.

43:18.163 --> 43:20.330
You two started
sculpting together?

43:20.398 --> 43:23.566
She's more competitive
than I was.

43:23.602 --> 43:27.837
And started entering us
in these bigger competitions.

43:27.906 --> 43:30.506
We even talked about
doing this one in Westford.

43:30.575 --> 43:32.775
You know,
tackling the big sculptures.

43:32.811 --> 43:34.811
Why didn't you?

43:36.715 --> 43:38.414
Tara and I had been
dating three years

43:38.450 --> 43:40.450
and all of a sudden...

43:40.485 --> 43:43.219
right before Christmas

43:43.254 --> 43:46.923
she decided it's not working
for her.

43:46.958 --> 43:49.158
She already had a plane ticket
to Los Angeles.

43:50.895 --> 43:53.496
Never saw it coming.

43:53.565 --> 43:55.131
Sorry.

43:55.166 --> 43:58.935
I haven't had much interest
in competing ever since.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.070
My heart's just not into it.

44:03.108 --> 44:07.043
Maybe you just need to find
somebody to make it fun again.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.149
Maybe.

44:15.720 --> 44:19.656
I got a V chisel if you want to
take a shot at that corner.

44:19.724 --> 44:23.393
I think a scoop chisel
might be the way to go.

44:23.428 --> 44:25.828
Huh.

44:25.897 --> 44:28.097
Well, I got one of those too.

44:36.741 --> 44:38.274
Hi.
Hey there.

44:38.309 --> 44:40.309
Almost finished.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.711
How was your day?

44:41.746 --> 44:42.712
Oh, just trying to
get everything together

44:42.747 --> 44:45.448
for this deposition.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.150
Have... have you heard from Emma?

44:47.218 --> 44:49.118
No. Why?

44:49.154 --> 44:50.798
Oh, it's just she wasn't
in the office this afternoon

44:50.822 --> 44:55.792
and I left a few messages,
I just haven't heard back.

44:56.961 --> 44:58.428
This is an important case.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.063
I'm sure she's on top of it.

45:00.098 --> 45:02.065
I don't know.

45:02.100 --> 45:05.101
Her head seems to be
somewhere else half the time.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.070
We barely seem to talk anymore.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.938
Well...

45:08.973 --> 45:11.040
two of you have a lot
on your plate right now.

45:12.744 --> 45:16.379
My advice is for the both of you
to throttle back a little.

45:19.584 --> 45:20.983
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.487
Christmas Festival
starts tonight.

45:24.556 --> 45:28.257
We'll meet Emma there,
enjoy the festivities...

45:28.293 --> 45:29.759
together.

45:29.794 --> 45:33.029
And everything will be fine.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.731
Oh.

45:34.766 --> 45:36.599
(sighing)

45:36.634 --> 45:38.735
Yeah.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.113
We make a pretty good team.

45:50.148 --> 45:51.247
(phone chiming)

45:51.282 --> 45:53.416
Oh.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.186
Oh no.

45:57.222 --> 45:58.187
I got to go.

45:58.223 --> 45:59.422
What's wrong?

45:59.457 --> 46:01.057
No, nothing, I just...

46:01.092 --> 46:03.559
I should be at work, we've got
this big case coming up

46:03.595 --> 46:05.394
and I haven't even finished.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.730
And my parents want me

46:07.766 --> 46:10.800
to meet them at the
Christmas Festival tonight.

46:10.869 --> 46:12.034
Maybe I'll see you there.

46:12.070 --> 46:13.436
Not if I don't get my work done.

46:13.471 --> 46:15.972
Well then, get out of here,
get to work.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.541
All right. Thanks for...

46:18.576 --> 46:20.376
thanks for letting me chip.

46:20.411 --> 46:22.545
It's my pleasure.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.714
All right. I'm out.

46:28.186 --> 46:30.253
(mouthing words)

46:31.556 --> 46:36.092
<i>♪</i>

46:36.127 --> 46:38.861
Beautiful!

46:38.897 --> 46:41.731
Oh, my gosh. This is gorgeous.

46:41.766 --> 46:43.766
Oh, look at these.

46:43.802 --> 46:46.269
Very nice.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.271
I'm going to get
one of these for you.

46:48.306 --> 46:49.739
Yes, you are.

46:49.774 --> 46:51.674
Can you see her?
No.

46:51.709 --> 46:53.209
Harvey:
Good evening, everyone!

46:53.244 --> 46:54.710
Welcome to the first night

46:54.746 --> 46:57.513
of Westford's annual
Christmas Festival!

46:57.549 --> 47:00.683
(cheering)

47:00.718 --> 47:03.553
I'm going to give her a call.
Sounds good, yeah.

47:04.689 --> 47:07.423
(phone ringing)

47:08.893 --> 47:10.193
Hi, Mom.

47:10.228 --> 47:13.196
Hey. What...

47:13.231 --> 47:15.264
Oh, Emma,
you don't have to be working

47:15.300 --> 47:18.367
<i>on the first night of
the Christmas Festival.</i>

47:18.403 --> 47:20.403
I...

47:20.438 --> 47:23.239
Okay. Five minutes.
We'll be here.

47:23.274 --> 47:25.241
She's at the office.

47:25.276 --> 47:26.921
Harvey:
I'm especially excited
to remind everyone

47:26.945 --> 47:30.446
that because of
the donations from you

47:30.515 --> 47:33.950
the ice sculpting competition
is part of our festival again.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.551
(cheering)
All right!

47:35.587 --> 47:36.953
(cheering)

47:37.021 --> 47:38.688
That's great!

47:38.723 --> 47:40.523
It certainly is.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.725
Do you know what?
If I know Emma,

47:42.760 --> 47:44.961
that five minutes
is going to take an hour.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.707
So I'm just... I'm just
going to go get here and...

47:46.731 --> 47:48.197
Well, don't...
You wait here.

47:48.233 --> 47:49.498
I'm going to go get her.

47:49.534 --> 47:50.833
Okay.
Carol!

47:50.869 --> 47:53.202
(knocking)

47:56.207 --> 47:58.207
Hey, I was just headed over.

47:58.243 --> 47:59.709
I'm sorry. Nick!

47:59.744 --> 48:00.910
Hi.

48:00.945 --> 48:04.113
Hi. Welcome.

48:04.182 --> 48:06.182
Yeah, Lonny told me
you worked on Riverton Street,

48:06.217 --> 48:09.285
your mom's law office, and I
figured, "What are the odds?"

48:09.354 --> 48:12.288
Right? More than one lawyer
named Parkers on the street.

48:12.357 --> 48:14.223
You found me.

48:14.259 --> 48:15.870
Yeah. Look, if you're busy
I'll come back.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.994
No, no, no. Come in, come in.

48:23.902 --> 48:27.069
It's very lawyerish.

48:27.105 --> 48:30.072
(chuckling)

48:31.843 --> 48:34.877
Uh, this seemed like a good idea
a little while ago.

48:34.913 --> 48:36.612
What did?

48:36.681 --> 48:38.014
All right.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.749
The thing is...

48:39.784 --> 48:40.928
I've been thinking about
what you said.

48:40.952 --> 48:43.085
And maybe you're right.

48:43.154 --> 48:47.023
Maybe it would be good for me to
take another shot at competing.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.225
And not to win, 'cause, you
know, that was never the...

48:49.260 --> 48:51.260
the point of it all.

48:52.931 --> 48:57.166
I just want to feel
the way it used to feel

48:57.201 --> 48:59.235
before things got
all jumbled up.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.037
When it was fun.

49:01.072 --> 49:03.072
I think that's a great idea.

49:04.676 --> 49:07.910
So, like you said,

49:07.946 --> 49:09.912
I just need to find
the right partner.

49:09.948 --> 49:13.582
Someone who knows
big sculptures.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.718
Someone...

49:16.988 --> 49:17.988
like you.

49:18.022 --> 49:20.056
I...

49:20.091 --> 49:22.158
You already have a partner.

49:22.193 --> 49:25.494
My dad and I have been sculpting
together since I was a kid.

49:27.498 --> 49:29.265
Sort of a tradition.

49:29.334 --> 49:31.567
I'm sorry.

49:31.602 --> 49:32.835
Hey, don't be sorry.

49:32.870 --> 49:35.371
I, uh, I'll be there
to cheer you on.

49:35.406 --> 49:36.939
100%.

49:37.008 --> 49:38.541
Go, Emma!

49:38.576 --> 49:40.810
(laughing)

49:40.845 --> 49:42.912
Nick:
So, I should go.

49:42.981 --> 49:45.181
I'll walk you out.

49:54.359 --> 49:55.725
I'll see you then.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.994
Okay.

50:08.573 --> 50:13.109
<i>♪</i>

50:13.177 --> 50:14.610
Dan:
Emma.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.712
What are you doing out here
so early?

50:16.748 --> 50:19.682
Well, if the Parkers family team
wants to win this year

50:19.717 --> 50:21.283
we better busy.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.953
Yeah, I've been, uh...

50:24.022 --> 50:25.921
I've been thinking about that.

50:25.957 --> 50:27.590
Good. We don't have much time.

50:27.625 --> 50:32.628
As much as I have loved
doing this with you, kiddo.

50:34.465 --> 50:36.899
I am... snowed under with work.

50:36.934 --> 50:39.935
I think you're going to have to
find a new partner this year.

50:40.004 --> 50:41.871
Really?

50:41.906 --> 50:44.040
But, um...

50:44.075 --> 50:45.574
this is our tradition.

50:45.610 --> 50:48.611
And I have... I've loved
every minute of it.

50:48.679 --> 50:52.348
And I want you to carry on that
tradition with someone else,

50:52.383 --> 50:54.550
someone who loves this
as much as we do.

50:58.289 --> 51:00.756
But I've never done it
without you.

51:00.792 --> 51:04.160
Well, that's why...

51:04.195 --> 51:08.097
this time around you can
make it your own.

51:13.071 --> 51:15.071
That's my girl.

51:31.789 --> 51:33.756
Man:
Hey, Nick!

51:36.327 --> 51:38.094
Hey!
Hey.

51:38.162 --> 51:39.829
Isn't this crazy?

51:39.864 --> 51:41.363
When I was a kid I used to think

51:41.399 --> 51:44.667
this must be what
Santa's toy shop was like.

51:44.702 --> 51:47.603
So much to do before Christmas.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.238
So, you and your dad all set?

51:49.273 --> 51:52.575
Mm, he can't do it this year.

51:52.610 --> 51:53.576
Work.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.411
So.
Oh.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.745
I'm sorry.

51:56.781 --> 51:59.281
Yeah, me too.

51:59.350 --> 52:00.916
So you don't have a partner?

52:00.985 --> 52:03.419
Did you?

52:03.488 --> 52:05.154
Did you find someone?

52:05.189 --> 52:06.856
That's a lot of work.
Yeah.

52:06.891 --> 52:09.391
Not much time to prepare.

52:09.427 --> 52:10.759
On the other hand...

52:10.828 --> 52:11.861
It could be fun.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.696
It could be fun.

52:13.731 --> 52:15.498
Partners?

52:15.533 --> 52:17.366
Partners.

52:17.401 --> 52:20.569
(laughing)

52:22.707 --> 52:23.984
Emma:
All right, we don't have much
time so I'm going to give you

52:24.008 --> 52:25.708
the CliffsNotes version
of the rules.

52:25.743 --> 52:28.511
Each team has two members,
we're given six blocks of ice.

52:28.546 --> 52:30.412
Sculptures have to be
at least five feet tall

52:30.481 --> 52:31.847
but no more than 10 feet.

52:31.883 --> 52:34.316
And we can only use
the ice we're given.

52:34.352 --> 52:35.985
How do you remember all that?

52:36.020 --> 52:37.419
Cute.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.422
Competition lasts three days,
72 hours,

52:40.491 --> 52:43.659
during that time each
team member is only permitted

52:43.694 --> 52:46.362
a total carving time
of up to 36 hours.

52:46.397 --> 52:48.731
That's to make sure
nobody gets too tired.

52:48.766 --> 52:50.332
And that's it.

52:50.368 --> 52:51.734
Got it.
Got it.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.269
Got it.

52:53.337 --> 52:54.870
(sighing)

52:54.906 --> 52:57.573
Wow. That's some
serious hardware.

52:57.642 --> 52:58.841
Thank you.

52:58.876 --> 53:01.143
(grunting)

53:02.580 --> 53:04.180
So, where are your power tools?

53:04.215 --> 53:06.315
I don't use 'em.

53:06.350 --> 53:09.752
Okay. Well, uh,
then we'll work on that first.

53:09.820 --> 53:11.086
Why?

53:11.155 --> 53:13.155
Nick, these aren't
little sculptures

53:13.191 --> 53:15.858
you put on a table
at a wedding.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.593
These are huge.

53:17.662 --> 53:20.029
If we just use hand tools
we'll never finish in time.

53:20.064 --> 53:22.431
You're smiling.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.432
Why are you smiling?
I'm not.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.833
You are smiling.
I'm not.

53:24.869 --> 53:27.536
Seriously, we don't have time
for this.

53:27.572 --> 53:30.806
It's just, okay, look,
all of a sudden I...

53:30.841 --> 53:33.375
I could see this
gangly little girl

53:33.411 --> 53:35.144
all serious about this stuff

53:35.179 --> 53:39.348
who had no idea that she'd grow
up to be someone so amazing.

53:42.753 --> 53:44.920
(sighing)
Come on, we have work to do.

53:55.066 --> 53:56.632
See?

53:56.667 --> 53:58.545
You can't get a cut like that
with a power tool.

53:58.569 --> 53:59.535
Yeah.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.303
It's nice.

54:01.339 --> 54:03.539
And who knows? Maybe we could
finish by next Christmas.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.641
Is that sarcasm?

54:10.081 --> 54:12.214
(whistling)

54:14.752 --> 54:16.819
What? Whoa.

54:18.756 --> 54:22.191
Okay. Now, just remember
nice and easy.

54:24.629 --> 54:25.561
(gasping)

54:25.630 --> 54:27.396
Oh, boy.

54:27.465 --> 54:29.064
Wow.

54:29.133 --> 54:30.733
All right.

54:30.801 --> 54:33.035
I guess we'll start again.

54:33.070 --> 54:35.471
Sorry.

54:40.511 --> 54:41.844
Now, that's eight feet.

54:41.879 --> 54:42.956
So that's how tall
our sculpture should be.

54:42.980 --> 54:46.215
Wow, that's big.

54:46.250 --> 54:48.584
We still have to come up
with a design.

54:51.222 --> 54:53.355
Look, we can't just
settle on one thing.

54:53.391 --> 54:55.391
Right? We have to...

54:55.459 --> 54:59.728
I don't know, think of something
that tells a story

54:59.797 --> 55:02.564
with one image.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.500
Okay. What do you suggest?

55:04.535 --> 55:06.335
That's the thing, I don't know.

55:06.370 --> 55:09.204
What we need right now
is some serious inspiration.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.241
Well, we'd better
get inspired soon

55:12.310 --> 55:14.054
or we're going to have the only
sculpture in town history

55:14.078 --> 55:16.478
called the block of ice.

55:16.514 --> 55:18.514
(laughing)

55:19.650 --> 55:20.827
All right. It's been a long day.

55:20.851 --> 55:22.217
Why don't we just
call it a night

55:22.286 --> 55:24.687
and we'll come up
with something tomorrow?

55:24.722 --> 55:26.055
Sure.

55:26.123 --> 55:28.524
Great.

55:29.527 --> 55:30.492
This was good.

55:30.528 --> 55:31.560
Yeah.

55:31.629 --> 55:33.696
Yeah?
Yeah.

55:33.731 --> 55:35.998
Okay, then.

56:01.659 --> 56:03.492
Nick, it's Emma.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.295
Remember what you said
about town history?

56:09.633 --> 56:11.500
Trust me.

56:11.535 --> 56:14.169
Emma, welcome back.

56:14.205 --> 56:16.004
Hi, Vera,
this is Nick Claiborne.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.807
He and I are partnering up for
the ice sculpting competition.

56:18.843 --> 56:20.209
Nice to meet you.

56:20.277 --> 56:22.089
But shouldn't you two be
sharpening your chisels?

56:22.113 --> 56:23.790
Well, we have to decide
what to sculpt first.

56:23.814 --> 56:25.948
Do you mind if we look at
those pictures again?

56:25.983 --> 56:29.284
I'll go get them. Oh, take a
look at the new display.

56:31.222 --> 56:33.288
(gasping)

56:35.693 --> 56:38.694
I can't believe they made
all these with just hand tools.

56:38.729 --> 56:40.062
Pretty amazing, right?

56:40.131 --> 56:42.030
No kidding. But...

56:42.099 --> 56:44.700
I'm still not sure how this
is going to help us.

56:44.769 --> 56:46.602
Well.

56:46.637 --> 56:49.204
All these sculptures
are special in some way

56:49.273 --> 56:52.641
and just want whatever we do
to mean something too.

56:54.712 --> 56:55.922
It's not about the town, is it?

56:55.946 --> 56:57.346
It's about you.

56:57.381 --> 56:59.448
(sighing)

56:59.483 --> 57:02.351
My mother doesn't even know
I'm doing this.

57:03.888 --> 57:06.522
I, uh, I didn't tell her

57:06.557 --> 57:08.957
it's a distraction
from my legal career.

you weren't a lawyer.

57:11.162 --> 57:13.028

he said he got my call
about the donation.

He said it wasn't him.

give all that money

58:26.537 --> 58:29.037
Maybe because that's the
definition of anonymous.

Okay. Well, I'd like to
at least thank them.

for our sculpture.

Good.

come up with a design.

Nick is a great guy.

Sounds like it.

But I just have so much going on
right now with the competition

need to stay focused.

58:56.233 --> 58:58.100
Focused is good.

58:58.168 --> 58:59.668
Don't give me that.

58:59.703 --> 59:02.237
Don't even.

59:02.306 --> 59:05.007
Okay. I admit I had my doubts
about the museum

59:05.042 --> 59:07.009
and getting inspired
and all that stuff.

59:07.044 --> 59:11.246
But when you left it was like,
boom, there it was.

Keep in mind
I can't draw for beans.

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:57.972
Yeah. Okay. I'm not an expert.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.552
But, uh, it's supposed to be
a good thing, right?

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.110
Yeah, no. I'm...
I'm really excited.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.611
Okay, well you don't
seem like it.

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:04.879
Don't you want to be a lawyer?

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.247
I do.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:09.050
Of course. I mean,
why else would I...

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:10.763
go to school and knock myself
off for three years.

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:12.120
I don't know.

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:14.422
Maybe it's because
a part of that big plan,

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.291
the one you worked
your whole life for.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.426
It is a great plan.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.033
It makes a lot of sense.

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:27.635
I mean, my mom and I are
going to be partners now.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:30.772
So, what, you don't want
your name on the door?

01:08:31.908 --> 01:08:34.309
You know what? I...

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:35.410
I should take a break.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.978
Emma.

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.948
Remember what you told me
about being an artist?

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:42.317
I don't hold a candle to you.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.988
Thanks.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.392
Thanks for the coffee.

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:15.550
That looks like
a big block of ice.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960
(phone buzzing)

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:29.930
Hi, Mom.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.433
Hi, honey. I'm just checking in.

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.402
How did everything go
at the school with Vera?

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:36.738
Yeah. Um... great.

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:39.474
Great. They're all ready to go.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.475
And she's really excited.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:41.776
<i>Wonderful.</i>

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.444
Thank you for
taking care of that.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.613
Of course. Um...

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.049
How did the depositions go?

01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:49.884
It went really well.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.187
In fact, we finished early
and I'm leaving now.

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:54.722
<i>I'll tell you all about it
when I get home.</i>

01:09:54.758 --> 01:09:56.424
Sounds good.

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.626
You know, I just... I just
wanted to ask you something.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.094
<i>Sure.</i>

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:02.530
I was thinking about
what we said

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:05.200
about not spending
enough time together.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.235
<i>And I was really hoping</i>

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.737
<i>we might have dinner at home
tonight just the three of us.</i>

01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:13.686
<i>I mean, I don't know, maybe
turn on the tree lights.</i>

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.910
And put on the music.

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:19.747
And maybe watch an old Christmas
movie like we used to.

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:20.748
How does that sound?

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:23.284
Uh, tonight?

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.687
Oh, unless of course
you have other plans.

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:28.890
No, you know what?

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.191
Mom, tonight sounds great.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:31.392
<i>Okay, good.</i>

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:32.393
(giggling)

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:34.028
I'll call your dad

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:35.908
and I'll tell him there'll be
three of us for dinner.

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:38.032
Great. I'll see you then.

01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:40.068
<i>Okay. Bye, sweetheart.</i>

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:50.678
Sorry, I fell asleep.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.380
That's okay.
I thought that was the point.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:54.716
That's...

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.184
Yeah. Did you get some rest?

01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:58.753
Yeah, I got a couple hours.
I'm good to go.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.755
Great.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.690
You tell your parents
the good news?

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.726
Uh, not yet.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.628
When are you going to tell 'em?

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:09.030
Tonight at dinner.

01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:10.365
Tonight?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.533
Yeah. No, don't worry.

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:16.337
I won't be gone long.
We'll finish in time still.

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:18.217
Yeah, right. I'm sure they're
going to be really excited

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.341
to hear the big news.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.890
Emma.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:38.026
Emma! Emma! Wait!

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:41.062
I was...

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:42.697
If you hadn't...
It's okay.

01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.165
We can fix it.
Stopped me.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.834
Look. Lonny and Sarah
brought some cider.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.836
Let's take a break
and then we'll fix it.

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:49.837
I wasn't even paying attention.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:51.205
If you hadn't stopped me

01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:53.508
I could've ruined
the whole sculpture.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:54.543
But you didn't.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:55.743
It's all right.

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:56.844
It's not all right.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.446
Nothing's all right.

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:00.226
I keep trying to figure out
the right thing to do

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:03.918
but I just keep
doing everything wrong.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:08.423
The sculpture, my parents,
my career.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:10.591
You.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.895
Look around.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:14.896
Here.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:16.397
Look at all these people

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:18.533
doing something that
they thought they lost.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.568
You did this.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.915
You made Christmas a little more
special for all of them.

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:32.613
And a lot more special for me.

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:36.384
Really?

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:38.486
Yeah, I was...

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:40.855
I was ready to give up
on all this.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:43.891
But you changed my mind.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:49.831
And... I'm not letting you give
up on what you really want.

01:12:57.774 --> 01:13:00.575
What I want...

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.576
it's not part of that plan.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.111
Oh, yeah?

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:05.513
Then it's time for a new plan.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:07.181
Okay?

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:09.417
Look inside your heart, Emma.

01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:11.986
Find the thing
that you really love.

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.024
And that's how you know
you found the right choice.

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:25.533
Carol:
Oh, Emma, that's wonderful news.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.603
Congratulations, honey,
on passing the bar.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:30.671
We are so proud of you.

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:34.742
Thanks, guys.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:36.511
It's still kind of sinking in.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.646
Well, I never had any doubt.

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:40.515
But this makes it official.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:44.252
So, to Emma Parkers,
attorney at law.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.888
To Emma!

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.256
Oh, can I give it to her now?

01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:49.724
It's supposed to be
for Christmas.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.259
Close enough.

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:52.894
Give me what?

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.595
(laughing)

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:56.664
Your mother.

01:13:58.034 --> 01:13:59.066
What is it?

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:01.702
Open it and see.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.007
Partners.

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.542
Just like we planned.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:10.711
Just like we planned.

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:13.147
Emma?

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:15.183
What is it, honey? What's wrong?

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.188
I need to show you something.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:37.572
Do... do you know
what this is all about?

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.074
Maybe we'll just let
Emma explain it.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.851
Mom. Nick Claiborne.

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:51.719
Nick, my mother.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:52.965
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mrs. Parkers.

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:53.921
Hello.
Hi.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.023
Hey, Dan.

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.492
Hey, Nick. Looks great.

01:14:57.527 --> 01:14:59.660
Yeah. It's coming along.

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:00.995
Um, excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:04.365
Maybe because I'm freezing,
but, uh,

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.134
I'd really like to know
exactly what's going on here.

01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:14.308
But I decided to enter the
ice sculpting competition.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.978
Nick and I are partners
and this is our sculpture.

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:21.015
(laughing) Honey.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.617
You didn't need to
keep that a secret,

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:23.762
I think it's good for you
to have hobbies.

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:25.486
And, I mean,

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:28.422
especially ones you can schedule
around a busy law practice.

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.926
(sighing)

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.395
That's the thing,
I'm not sure I want to do that.

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:38.633
Wait? What do you mean?

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.171
Look, Mom.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.574
I don't think
I want to be a lawyer.

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:50.077
I'm not sure I ever really did.

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:54.048
But...

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:57.418
I mean, this has been our plan
since...

01:15:57.453 --> 01:15:59.487
since you were a little girl.

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:01.622
It was your plan, Mom.

01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:04.091
And it was a good one.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:06.928
It was. It just...

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:07.929
Not the right one.

01:16:07.964 --> 01:16:10.164
Not for me.

01:16:15.505 --> 01:16:17.505
Are you sure you want to

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:20.608
walk away from everything
you've worked so hard for?

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:21.742
Dan.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.411
Tell her. What...

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:25.780
Oh, honey.

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:29.417
We always said that the most
important thing we wanted

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:30.952
is for Emma to be happy.

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:33.254
And this is what I love.

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:37.425
But a career in law
has a future.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.426
And...

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:40.127
Mrs. Parkers.

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:43.264
It's not more than just a
future, it's about passion.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:46.067
I mean, this whole
ice sculpting competition

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.702
would've been cancelled
this year.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.971
Yes. I know.

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:52.907
Well, if it wasn't for Emma
none of this would've happened.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.976
She raised all the money.

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:57.378
Is that true?

01:16:57.413 --> 01:16:59.814
Well, yeah. But I... I mean,
I had a lot of help

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:03.217
with Sarah and Nick and Dad
even made a few phone calls.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:04.885
Oh, so...

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:06.721
Oh, you did know?

01:17:06.756 --> 01:17:09.991
Well, I made a couple of calls.

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:16.263
Emma, sculpting ice
isn't exactly a career.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:22.470
I know. But...

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.107
It felt right.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.541
Working for a good cause,

01:17:27.577 --> 01:17:29.355
bringing people together
to help make it happen.

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:32.480
Seeing how happy
it made everyone.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.628
I mean, I know I still have to
figure out the rest of my life

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:39.654
but I like the way this felt.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.324
And I'm just...

01:17:43.393 --> 01:17:46.794
I'm not sure I'm ready to make
up my mind about being a lawyer.

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:51.065
But whatever I choose...

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.567
right now?

01:17:53.603 --> 01:17:55.970
This is what I want.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.974
This is my Christmas.

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:06.247
Well.

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:08.382
Your father's right.

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.621
The most important thing
is your happiness.

01:18:16.426 --> 01:18:21.062
But, oh, my dear, you could be
one powerful good lawyer.

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:24.298
So, you're not disappointed?

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:27.735
Honey, we would never be
disappointed in you.

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.371
And let's face it,
it's not exactly a surprise.

01:18:31.607 --> 01:18:33.140
What?

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:35.109
Well, every Christmas
for all these years

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:37.878
you and your father
have been completely loopy

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:40.047
about this competition.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:42.883
I mean, it wasn't like you were
just going to give it up.

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:45.386
So, you knew I had second
thoughts about being a lawyer?

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:49.190
Well, I mean, I had hope
that once you did the bar

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:51.425
you'd be ready to, you know,
give it a chance.

01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:54.295
But then I thought
what you really needed

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:57.765
was the chance to finally
decide for yourself.

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:02.703
Am I missing something here?

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.305
You and me both.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.974
How was she going to decide
what she really wanted

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:09.710
if the competition was
cancelled?

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.746
Wait.

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:14.081
You donated the $10,000?

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.221
I...

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:23.691
I just wanted you
to have the choice...

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:25.893
to do the thing
you love the most.

01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:31.966
Mom.

01:19:34.604 --> 01:19:36.570
Thank you.

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:44.178
And besides, you were right,
it was for a very good cause.

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:46.213
My daughter's Christmas.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:48.994
Promise you guys will both
be here tomorrow

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:50.162
when they announce the winner?

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:52.453
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:54.221
Oh.

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:56.357
But now, you two better get busy

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:59.093
because you've
a lot of work to do.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.362
Yeah, we got a long night
ahead of us.

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:03.531
I'm going to enjoy
every minute of it.

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:23.083

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:25.052
How much time?

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:27.054
It's almost there.

01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:28.600
Harvey:
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for the sculptors.

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:31.091
They've been working hard
for three days.

01:20:31.127 --> 01:20:33.494
(cheering)

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:34.873
Send them some energy. Come on,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:36.430
Give it to them!
Give it to them!

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.399
Send them some energy!

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:39.700
(cheering)

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:41.569
I don't know about you,

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:44.205
but I think this has been the
best ice sculpting competition

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.406
we've ever had.

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.942
(cheering)

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:03.357
Look at those beautiful
sculptures!

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:07.161
How much time?

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.263
Oh, it's getting close.

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.400
Hey! Focus.

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:14.847
We're on the last few minutes
here, folks.

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:17.338
What do you think?
Aren't they beautiful?

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.707
(cheering)

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:28.883
We're getting down to the wire.

01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:31.318
In five...

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.921
All:
Four, three,

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:36.223
two, one!

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:37.591
(horn blaring)

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.326
And that's it, time's up,
tools down!

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:40.561
Hands up.

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:43.664
Can I get the judges
to the stage

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:45.699
with their score cards please?

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:51.038
I just want you to know
that no matter what happens

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.908
you made every Christmas wish
I had come true.

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:56.710
Emma, you are my Christmas wish.

01:21:58.314 --> 01:22:00.192
Okay, folks, the judges have
made their decisions.

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:01.749
And...

01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:03.417
it's unanimous.

01:22:03.486 --> 01:22:04.718
Unanimous?

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:06.487
Harvey:
Folks, I'm pleased to announce

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:10.190
that the winner of the Westford
ice sculpting competition...

01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:13.994
is Emma Parkers
and Nick Claiborne!

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:15.996
(cheering)

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:18.565
For their sculpture called
"Memories of Westford".

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:20.901
(cheering)

01:22:20.937 --> 01:22:21.902
We did it.

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:22.903
We did.

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:25.539
(cheering)

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:29.710
Oh, congratulations.

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:30.978
It's beautiful.

01:22:31.013 --> 01:22:33.380
Well done, Nick.

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:36.417
(laughing) We did it.

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:38.018
I knew you could do it.

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:39.386
Way to go, Nick.

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:41.221
Oh, my gosh.

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:43.324
Congrats. Wow.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:44.825
Congratulations.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.194
And, listen,
I meant what I said.

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:49.141
If you ever want to test
your talents outside of law

01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:51.565
we can certainly use you
at the town.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.933
Oh.

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:55.669
Well, I just might
take you up on that.

01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:58.372
(laughing)

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:02.876
What are you doing?

01:23:02.912 --> 01:23:04.211
Da da dun nah!

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:05.679
(singing fanfare)

01:23:05.715 --> 01:23:08.382
(laughing)

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:11.352
Merry Christmas.

01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:14.321
Merry Christmas, Nick.
