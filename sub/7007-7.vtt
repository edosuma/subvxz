<i>Welcome to Tool Time on location.
All this week we're gonna show you</i>

00:05.171 --> 00:07.935
how to remodel and organize your garage.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.637
And as you can see, this garage is
crammed full of every object imaginable.

00:11.711 --> 00:14.737
There's one object missing.
It's called an automobile.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.840
Right. The owner of this
garage has a classic Studebaker.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.977
But because it's so crowded in here,

00:21.054 --> 00:23.147
he's got no place to put it.

00:23.223 --> 00:26.454
First you want to get rid of
the big objects, like this totem pole.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.586
No, no, no!
I could never part with my pole!

00:29.662 --> 00:33.428
This is my neighbor, Wilson. It's his
garage we're trying to organize.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.297
Oh, my old bagpipes.

00:36.403 --> 00:39.167
To clean out your garage,
you have to part with stuff.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.366
Right. Let's get rid
of this old bathtub.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.535
No, no, no, no, no.
That's my special tub right there.

00:44.611 --> 00:48.513
You know, in the Roaring Twenties, my
father used this to make bathtub gin.

00:49.182 --> 00:53.642
That would explain the duck without
a liver and with a case of jaundice.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.554
Why don't we dump this big lady?

00:57.624 --> 01:02.084
<i>You do what you want with your mom.
We're trying to do a Tool Time show.</i>

01:02.162 --> 01:05.290
Now, hands off that statue, Al.
That is a family heirloom.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.629
If that lady could only talk...

01:07.700 --> 01:10.863
<i>This Tool Time episode
would take forever to do.</i>

01:10.970 --> 01:12.733
- How about dumping the tuba?
- Yeah.

01:12.839 --> 01:14.568
- No way!
- How about the dog sled?

01:14.641 --> 01:16.575
- Don't be ridiculous.
- The cannon?

01:16.643 --> 01:19.771
Never!

01:20.814 --> 01:24.147
- How about something small?
- No, no, no, no.

01:24.217 --> 01:27.675
These are the gloves I wore in my
exhibition bout with Sonny Liston.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.415
- You were a boxer?
- Yes, indeedy.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.219
Back then I was known
as Sugar Wilson Wilson.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.920
To your corners, fellas.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.931
Get your own punching bag.
This punching bag is mine.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.729
Well, sometimes
to clear out your garage,

01:43.803 --> 01:46.863
the first thing you have
to get rid of is the owner.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.707
<i>Hi. Welcome back to Tool Time
and our special segment,</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:56.237
"Organizing Your Garage." Al has
installed the last of our cabinets.

01:56.316 --> 02:00.685
As before, we used wood screws on
the rails along the inside perimeter.

02:00.753 --> 02:03.881
And as you can see, we built
the lower cabinets extra large

02:03.957 --> 02:06.653
so they can fit even
the most odd-shaped objects.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.990
Like Al. He fits.
You can barely even see him.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.394
I can't get out of here.

02:11.464 --> 02:15.833
But the best news is now we
have room for the Studebaker.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.164
Mm-hm.

02:17.237 --> 02:21.139
- The cabinets are all finished now.
- That's right. And it looks great.

02:21.207 --> 02:25.473
Best of all, I think we did a good job
of organizing Wilsors garage.

02:25.545 --> 02:28.708
- What do you think?
- Save for one minor detail.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.181
Yeah. Uh...

02:33.219 --> 02:38.282
<i>Uh, tune in tomorrow for another special

03:30.076 --> 03:32.567
- Can I give you a hand?
- No.

03:32.645 --> 03:36.411
It's always getting stuck like this.
It's becoming part of my workout.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.974
And-one-and-two, and-one-and-two.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.048
- Oh!
- Ah!

03:42.121 --> 03:44.783
- I am so sorry!
- It's OK.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.415
- Are you sure?
- Oh, really.

03:46.492 --> 03:50.053
After 50 reps on that quad machine,
I have no feeling left in that leg.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.131
- Oh!
- Really, it's all right.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.962
Oh, I can't believe I did that.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.426
- Good game, guys!
- Well, hi!

03:58.504 --> 04:00.665
- Hi.
- I didn't know you were gonna be here.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.106
I had a meeting
this morning that got pushed off.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.234
A little b-ball seemed like a good idea.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.575
- Who was the meeting with?
- A guy named Pee Wee.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.308
Ah.

04:09.382 --> 04:13.443
From the prestigious firm, Pee Wee,
Pee Wee, Pee Wee and Pee Wee.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.817
No. This guy Pee Wee's got this radio
I want for the '46 rod.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.017
- It's a one-of-a-kind. It's NOS.
- NOS? What's that?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.791
It's called "New Old Stock." Its
solenoid operates right from a '46 Ford.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.389
- It's got five-station pre-set.
- SIA.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.731
- What?
- "Sorry I Asked."

04:32.405 --> 04:37.172
<i>Oh, guess what? Patty got opera tickets.
We're gonna go see Carmen tonight.</i>

04:37.243 --> 04:40.371
Oh, no!

04:40.446 --> 04:45.213
<i>Carmen, the opera. Now, if they had
an opera named Car Man, I'd be there.</i>

04:46.653 --> 04:51.147
Um, Mom called. She said that family
reuniors gonna be in January now.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.590
I'm beginning
to hate those reunions.

04:53.693 --> 04:57.151
All these weird relatives picking
at me. Aunt Sally pinching my cheek.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.994
"Give me a little lippy, lippy."

05:00.066 --> 05:02.762
- I gotta go. See you later.
- See ya.

05:04.604 --> 05:08.335
- How's that leg?
- The leg's fine.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.899
<i>Did I overhear you say you're
going to see Carmen?</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:12.945
Oh, yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.810
Oh, it is one of my favorite operas.
I'm Ian.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.850
- Oh, Jill.
- You know, years ago,

05:17.917 --> 05:20.477
<i>I heard Marilyn Horne
sing Carmen at the Met.</i>

05:20.553 --> 05:23.420
- You heard Marilyn Horne?
- Yes, I did.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.548
<i>- I love her.
- Oh, when she sang Habeñera.</i>

05:25.625 --> 05:28.560
- Oh, that must have been amazing!
- It took my breath away.

05:46.212 --> 05:47.770
That's it!

05:54.821 --> 05:58.518
<i>- Do you like La Bohème?
- Oh, I love La Bohème.</i>

05:58.591 --> 06:03.119
It is coming to town next week. If you'd
like to see it, I'd love to take you.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.564
- Excuse me?
- Oh, maybe we can have dinner first.

06:11.037 --> 06:15.474
Um... um, did you just ask me
out on a, you know, like, a date?

06:15.541 --> 06:18.237
Well, I... Yeah, I did.

06:18.578 --> 06:22.275
I'm married. Oh.
Well, you couldn't see that.

06:22.348 --> 06:25.044
But there was just that guy
that I was just talking to...

06:25.118 --> 06:27.450
The one who hates your family?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.283
He's my husband.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.949
Your husband?
I thought he was your brother.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.258
- You thought he was my brother?
- Yeah.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.193
What made you
think he was my brother?

06:37.263 --> 06:42.030
Well, you know, I mean,
you're going to the opera with Patty.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.366
- And he's going to meet, uh, Pee Wee?
- Yeah.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.339
And, uh, you're looking
forward to your mom's reunion

06:48.408 --> 06:52.071
and he's worried about getting
a "lippy" from Aunt Sally. I...

06:52.145 --> 06:54.113
- God, I feel like such a jerk!
- No, no.

06:54.180 --> 06:58.742
If that's the way we came across,
you know, like Donny and Marie,

06:58.851 --> 07:01.217
I can understand
how you would've asked me out.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.788
The answer's no.
I understand how you would've...

07:03.856 --> 07:06.416
You really thought he was my brother.

07:06.526 --> 07:07.823
- Look, I'm sorry.
- God!

07:07.894 --> 07:09.657
You two are wonderful.

07:09.762 --> 07:13.493
If my husband sang with me that way,
we'd still be together.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.166
What is all that?

07:21.240 --> 07:23.367
It's all the stuff
Wilsors giving away.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.741
He gave me his boar.

07:25.812 --> 07:30.146
Yeah. We tried to give Wilson our bore,
but Mark wouldn't stay.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.740
Shut up.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.979
I don't want you rummaging
through stuff

07:34.053 --> 07:35.782
and bringing home all this junk.

07:35.855 --> 07:40.224
Useless? There is nothing useless
about a set of Ubangi nose flutes.

07:44.263 --> 07:47.357
I don't know whether
to say bravo or Gesundheit.

07:48.401 --> 07:52.098
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What have I told you a thousand times?

07:52.171 --> 07:54.867
I know.
No medieval combat in the house.

07:57.109 --> 07:59.543
I got a question for you.

07:59.612 --> 08:03.048
Where's a nice, quiet restaurant
two people can go and just talk?

08:04.417 --> 08:06.578
I love Sorentino's.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.985
That's a great idea.
That's where I'll take Pee Wee.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.026
Pee Wee?

08:14.126 --> 08:17.391
If I want that radio, I'm gonna
have to wine and dine that guy.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.328
I see.

08:19.398 --> 08:22.162
- Tim, we gotta talk.
- Mm-hm.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.532
I would have talked last night
when I got home.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.435
You were pretending you're asleep

08:26.506 --> 08:29.202
so you wouldn't have
to talk to me about the opera.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.402
If you knew,
why didn't you say something?

08:31.477 --> 08:34.446
If you go to that much trouble
to tune me out, what's the point?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.073
You're right.
If the system works, why mess with it?

08:40.419 --> 08:42.649
Yesterday when we were at the Y,

08:42.722 --> 08:45.885
you remember a guy that
was working out right next to me?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.858
No.

08:47.927 --> 08:51.385
Well, he was, and,
uh, he asked me out on a date.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.227
Where are you guys going?

08:56.335 --> 08:59.702
I'm serious. He asked me out
because he didn't realize I was married.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.900
- He thought that you were my brother.
- Where'd he get that idea?

09:02.975 --> 09:05.910
Because of the way we were relating.
We werert connecting.

09:05.978 --> 09:09.141
This is a guy that heard us talking
for five minutes? So what?

09:09.248 --> 09:12.684
I know. But it got me thinking
about the way we've been lately.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.686
How have we been lately?

09:14.754 --> 09:17.518
Out of tune.
Cut off from each other.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.718
I mean, yesterday we didn't
even kiss hello or goodbye.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.522
You were all sweaty.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.157
- I feel like we're drifting apart.
- We're not drifting apart.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.997
- You don't think so?
- No.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.435
Our relationship is like any couple
that's been married this long.

09:33.506 --> 09:37.670
It's comfortable.
It's... It's like an old pair of shoes.

09:39.879 --> 09:44.509
That's what our marriage has
become to you? Worn-out footwear?

09:45.551 --> 09:48.019
Not worn-out. Broken in.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.118
Stretched out.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.151
- This isn't helping, is it?
- No.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.028
Jill, I'm so glad you're here.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.432
Look, I want
to apologize again for yesterday.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.265
I had no idea he was your husband.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.501
Oh, well, based on what you saw,
how could you have known?

10:08.574 --> 10:10.337
Well, I should've figured it out.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.903
I'm just not used to this whole dating
thing. I told my kids I wasrt ready.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.711
- Your kids?
- Yeah. I have four.

10:17.783 --> 10:21.219
Their mother passed away six years ago.
I've been raising them myself.

10:21.287 --> 10:25.348
- Wow, that must be so hard!
- Well, it is in certain ways.

10:25.424 --> 10:28.325
I've gotten to know my daughters
better than most fathers.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.227
- You have four girls?
- You're looking at the only man

10:31.297 --> 10:34.425
on my block who can do a French braid.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.367
Four heads in 58 minutes.

10:37.436 --> 10:41.338
I can also hem a dress
and cook and mend a broken heart.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.932
Wow! Is there anything you can't do?

10:44.010 --> 10:47.241
- Yeah. Get myself out on a date.
- Oh.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.272
That's why when I saw you yesterday
and our duet brought down the gym,

10:51.384 --> 10:54.842
- it just... We seemed so perfect.
- Oh.

10:54.920 --> 10:59.186
It's just been a long time since I've,
uh, been attracted to somebody.

11:03.095 --> 11:06.360
Well, uh, you know,
I'm... I'm very flattered, Ian.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.196
You know, but, unfortunately,
I'm still very married.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.326
- Yeah.
- Did I say "unfortunately?"

11:11.404 --> 11:14.271
I didn't mean that.
What I meant was that, you know, like,

11:14.340 --> 11:19.243
under different circumstances,
you know, if I didn't have a wonderful

11:19.311 --> 11:23.805
husband at home who I love and cherish
and who loves and cherishes me,

11:23.883 --> 11:26.613
like a stretched-out old slipper...

11:28.554 --> 11:30.112
You would've said yes.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.852
Yes.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.227
Then I'm not totally crazy.
You are attracted to me too?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.729
Well, wow, look at that.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.170
This place is closing down.
We really should, uh, go.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.900
Yeah, I guess we should.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.204
Don't want to get locked in.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.302
No. Be stuck in here
together all night.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.244
No, don't want that.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.152
Have you noticed that we're not going?

12:02.221 --> 12:04.189
I noticed.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.186
What's the matter?

12:37.256 --> 12:40.987
- Oh, I had a dream.
- Oh. Did you have a bad one?

12:42.428 --> 12:43.918
Not exactly.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.624
What time is it?

12:46.699 --> 12:49.361
Mmm, it's 2:15.
I'm gonna read for awhile.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.404
Oh, could you read downstairs?
I gotta get up at 5:30.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.166
Why do you have to get up at 5:30?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.970
I gotta take Pee Wee pheasant-hunting.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.913
- You don't like hunting.
- Or pheasants.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.849
But I like that radio.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.818
I'm sorry.
I'll just go back to sleep.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.414
If you have trouble
sleeping, just do what I do.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.050
- What?
- Shut your eyes

13:14.160 --> 13:17.721
- and think about something you want.
- OK.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.560
Something you're dying
to get your hands on.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.237
It was an unbelievable dream.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.143
- From the moment this man, Ian...
- Oh.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.182
...walked in, we couldn't
take our eyes off of each other.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.912
- You could feel the heat.
- I'm feeling it now.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.950
This is very embarrassing.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.685
Not for me.
Don't leave out a single detail.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.989
- We're alone. The gym is empty.
- Uh-huh.

13:49.061 --> 13:53.122
We keep saying that we're gonna leave,
but nobody moves.

13:53.199 --> 13:57.533
And then it happens. We fall
into each other's arms and...

13:57.603 --> 13:59.969
...and kiss.

14:00.072 --> 14:02.336
Oh, wow!

14:02.408 --> 14:04.638
Oh, that is so hot.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.577
- What do you think of my dream?
- I wish it was mine!

14:07.646 --> 14:11.548
- No. It's very scary.
- Why?

14:11.617 --> 14:13.482
I'm a married woman.

14:13.552 --> 14:17.386
And I'm fantasizing about an
intimate relationship with another man.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.720
It's just a dream.
That's perfectly normal.

14:19.792 --> 14:23.694
No, no. It would be normal if there
werert a real guy I was attracted to

14:23.762 --> 14:27.892
and there wasrt some other who look
at me like I'm a pair of Florsheims.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.236
OK, OK. I...
Well, what are you saying?

14:33.305 --> 14:36.206
You're considering acting
on these feelings?

14:36.275 --> 14:41.008
No. No. I'm committed to Tim.
I would never... It's just...

14:41.080 --> 14:42.980
- Yeah?
- OK, so what?

14:43.048 --> 14:46.017
He says we're comfortable.
What's wrong with comfortable?

14:46.085 --> 14:48.053
A lot of couples
don't get comfortable.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.087
- Right.
- Right.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.281
We both know that fireworks burn out.

14:51.357 --> 14:55.817
- Comfortable lasts forever.
- What's wrong with that?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.227
- Everything!
- Everything.

14:59.598 --> 15:00.963
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.092
How was your dinner?
Did you get the radio?

15:03.168 --> 15:06.035
No. He was leading me on.

15:06.105 --> 15:10.735
He does this to innocent car guys
for free meals and pheasant ammo.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.368
Men!

15:16.315 --> 15:18.875
I'm sorry. I know how much
that radio meant to you.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.317
I can't believe
how much money I've wasted!

15:21.420 --> 15:23.115
Yeah, but it's only money.

15:23.188 --> 15:27.420
And you spent it because you love
cars so much. I can understand that.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.752
Are you all right?

15:33.032 --> 15:38.197
Yeah, fine. I, uh, rented us a video.
I thought we could watch it together.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.966
<i>Oh, no! Let me guess.
Terms of Endearment.</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:44.569
<i>Spartacus!</i>

15:44.643 --> 15:46.702
- That's my favorite movie.
- I know.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.542
I thought I'd give it another chance.

15:48.647 --> 15:52.014
Thought it might
bring us closer together.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.382
- I'm sitting right next to you.
- Tim.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.082
Does this have anything to do
with that guy at the gym

15:58.157 --> 15:59.886
that said I'd married my sister?

16:01.760 --> 16:05.389
What he said was that we seemed
like brother and sister.

16:05.464 --> 16:09.332
He's a con man, honey. He convinces a
woman that she's married to her brother.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.892
Next thing you know,
he's moved in,

16:11.971 --> 16:16.135
the husband's moved out into a furnished
apartment eating celery soup in a can.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.037
Honey, I love you.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.047
I'm not gonna leave you for another man.

16:23.115 --> 16:26.209
I don't want to go through
our marriage like brother and sister.

16:26.285 --> 16:30.381
Me too. Otherwise,
we'll have to move to the bayou.

16:34.293 --> 16:38.662
So tell me something. Are you totally
satisfied with the way we are?

16:38.731 --> 16:41.495
- Oh, yeah.
- Tim, come on!

16:43.569 --> 16:45.503
Well, not totally.

16:45.571 --> 16:50.736
OK. OK. If you could change something,
wake up and have something be different,

16:50.843 --> 16:53.607
- what would it be?
- Do you really want to know this?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.340
Yes, I do. Say it. Whatever it is.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.843
If something could be different,
I wish...

16:58.917 --> 17:00.851
I wish it could be
our sex life.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.979
- How?
- I wish we had one.

17:05.523 --> 17:09.085
- It's been a long time.
- I know. I know.

17:09.194 --> 17:14.290
But you know how hard it is for me
when I don't... feel close to you.

17:14.366 --> 17:18.200
Well, it's hard for me to feel close to
you if we don't have sex.

17:18.270 --> 17:21.103
- What are we gonna do?
- You said we were out of tune,

17:21.173 --> 17:23.733
so, uh, let's get a tune-up.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.537
What do you say I take you
to Sorentino's on Saturday?

17:27.613 --> 17:31.777
- A candlelight dinner, you and I?
- That sounds pretty good.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.614
Although, you are
on the rebound from Pee Wee.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.358
I think I can get over Pee Wee.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.190
Let me ask you a question.

17:44.263 --> 17:47.391
If there was one thing you
could change about our relationship,

17:47.466 --> 17:49.161
what would it be?

17:50.569 --> 17:52.730
I wish that we would talk more.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.330
And I wish sometimes,
if I'm feeling down,

17:55.407 --> 17:58.342
that you would put your arms
around me and just hold me.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.038
That's two things.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.444
I just wish you understood me better.

18:06.518 --> 18:10.181
Look past what I say sometimes and
try to figure out what I really mean.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.122
When I was talking about shoes,
what I was trying to say...

18:13.192 --> 18:18.528
It was like a metaphor for our marriage.
And instead of having my feelings hurt,

18:18.597 --> 18:22.226
I should have gotten past my own
insecurity and seen it for what it was:

18:22.301 --> 18:24.132
An affirmation of our love.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.541
Shoes. They say it all.

18:35.380 --> 18:39.146
Someday it'll just be the two of us
prowling around the house.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.482
You think we'll outlive the kids?

18:43.822 --> 18:47.986
I'm talking about when they move out.
You know, it's gonna leave a big void.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.857
We'll fill it with stuff
we've wanted to do together.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.294
Like what?

18:52.364 --> 18:54.924
Oh, chop and channel a '49 Merc.

18:56.568 --> 18:59.230
We'll buy a fishing boat.
We can gut our own flounder.

19:00.372 --> 19:03.034
- I'd rather work on the car.
- All right!

19:05.811 --> 19:09.508
- What about painting?
- I love painting.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.446
We could take lessons.

19:11.517 --> 19:14.782
Why? All you need
is a pan and two rollers.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.352
I was getting my hair cut
and I read a magazine that said...

19:20.425 --> 19:23.553
...that a couple
gets divorced every minute.

19:23.629 --> 19:27.292
Gee, you'd think that couple
would stop getting married.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.071
You know, when we first got married,

19:33.172 --> 19:36.505
I was so scared
that it wasrt gonna work out.

19:36.575 --> 19:40.636
And then there was this
one moment about six months in

19:40.712 --> 19:42.577
when I realized we were gonna be OK.

19:42.648 --> 19:46.277
I remember that. We went
on vacation down in the islands.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.911
Walked on the beach,
the moon was up there,

19:48.987 --> 19:52.923
and I told you I loved you more
than most of my tools.

19:55.994 --> 19:58.428
Actually, I blocked that moment out.

19:58.497 --> 20:03.560
No. I had been really sick
with this terrible, terrible flu.

20:03.635 --> 20:08.470
And you passed up Laker tickets so that
you could stay home and take care of me.

20:08.540 --> 20:12.408
Yeah. Well, I was young and in love.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.977
And I scalped those tickets
for three times their face value.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.745
I can't believe it's been 18 years.

20:23.355 --> 20:26.324
I can't believe it's been all night.
The surs coming up.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.451
Wow! Oh.

20:29.528 --> 20:33.225
Do you remember the last time
that we stayed up all night,

20:33.298 --> 20:35.858
just the two of us,
just sitting and talking?

20:35.934 --> 20:38.835
I know what night you're talking about.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.600
- The night I proposed.
- Yeah.

20:41.673 --> 20:45.234
Do you remember afterwards we went out
for breakfast to that place

20:45.310 --> 20:48.279
with the big wagon wheel out front?

20:48.347 --> 20:51.976
Yes! With that big wagon wheel
right in front of the place!

20:52.050 --> 20:53.915
- Yeah.
- What was the name of that?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.453
The Wagon Wheel.

20:57.656 --> 21:00.124
Do you remember what we did after that?

21:00.192 --> 21:02.251
Yes. I don't think
I could still do that

21:02.327 --> 21:05.626
after a plate of their Hi-ho
Silver Dollar Pancakes.

21:07.032 --> 21:08.590
Hello.

21:10.335 --> 21:13.361
Maybe this time we
should have pancakes after.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.599
Hi-ho, Silver!

21:30.355 --> 21:33.222
Jill? Where do you keep the cream rinse?
