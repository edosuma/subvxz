00:26.437 --> 00:29.524
Theorising that one could
time-travel within his own lifetime,

00:29.524 --> 00:32.860
Dr Sam Beckett stepped
into the quantum leap accelerator

00:32.860 --> 00:34.904
and vanished!

00:39.742 --> 00:42.161
He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past.

00:42.161 --> 00:45.832
Facing mirror images
that were not his own...

00:45.832 --> 00:50.002
and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:51.087 --> 00:53.589
His only guide on this journey is Al,

00:53.589 --> 00:56.843
an observer from his own time
who appears in the form

00:56.843 --> 01:00.930
of a hologram that only Sam
can see and hear.

01:00.930 --> 01:04.058
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:04.058 --> 01:06.978
striving to put right
what once went wrong,

01:06.978 --> 01:09.647
and hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:11.190 --> 01:13.234
..will be the leap home.

01:33.754 --> 01:36.007
No fair thinking about
anything but us.

01:36.007 --> 01:38.134
You promised.

01:38.134 --> 01:40.261
I...

01:40.261 --> 01:42.388
Yeah, I guess I did.

01:42.388 --> 01:44.557
We get so little time together.

01:44.557 --> 01:47.727
I won't have you off
thinking about anything but me.

01:50.813 --> 01:53.232
OK. Medical school.

01:53.232 --> 01:55.568
I won't be jealous
of medical school.

02:08.705 --> 02:12.251
What are you doing here?
Take him any way you want, Papa D.

02:12.251 --> 02:14.295
No!

03:30.538 --> 03:33.207
Ray, no! No!

03:33.207 --> 03:36.043
Make it stop! No!
Lonnie, make it stop!

03:37.128 --> 03:40.339
You make it stop.
They won't listen to me.
I wonder why (!)

03:40.339 --> 03:43.426
Lonnie, please!
Now it's 'Lonnie, please.'

03:43.426 --> 03:46.971
Well, what about when Lonnie said
please stay away from his brother?

03:55.313 --> 03:57.940
I can't stay away from him.
I love him.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.097
Until she gets bored.
Or until it ain't hip no more.

04:07.097 --> 04:10.016
Then what happens to Ray?
Isn't that my business?

04:10.016 --> 04:13.895
Not as long as I'm busting my ass
to put you through med school,
it ain't!

04:13.895 --> 04:16.815
You got your nose so wide open
you forgot what colour you are?

04:16.815 --> 04:19.108
What does colour have to do with it?
Say what?

04:19.108 --> 04:22.821
I think you choked him too long,
Papa D. Or not long enough.

04:22.821 --> 04:24.990
Colour shouldn't have
anything to do...

04:24.990 --> 04:27.033
with relationships.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.830
No-one should know that
better than us.

04:32.831 --> 04:37.085
You been sucking up to this white
trash so long, you starting
to sound like her.

04:37.085 --> 04:40.088
He sounds like your future.
Not MY future.

04:40.088 --> 04:42.841
She's talking about mine.
Doing what?

04:42.841 --> 04:45.343
Dumping Mr Charlie's bedpans?

04:45.343 --> 04:49.014
Yeah, man. Your MD ain't gonna stand
for more than 'moving doo-doo' (!)

04:49.014 --> 04:53.685
Ray's good. He'll be able to
practice anywhere in this country.
He's already breaking barriers.

04:53.685 --> 04:56.855
Do you think that's why Mom and I
busted our asses all these years?

04:56.855 --> 04:58.773
To break honky barriers?

05:02.027 --> 05:04.154
Ray's staying here.

05:04.154 --> 05:06.281
Taking care of his own people.

05:08.950 --> 05:11.077
It makes sense.
What about Boston?

05:11.077 --> 05:14.206
Boston? You're gonna walk away from
an internship at Brigham?

05:14.206 --> 05:17.375
Uh...
You never said nothing about Boston.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.503
Uh, I must've forgot to tell you.

05:19.503 --> 05:22.297
No. What you forgot
 is who you are!

05:24.216 --> 05:26.218
And we both know why!

05:28.011 --> 05:31.056
You're my brother, man,
and I love you.

05:32.182 --> 05:34.559
But she goes, Ray.

05:34.559 --> 05:36.686
She goes!

05:36.686 --> 05:38.855
And you stay!

05:55.690 --> 05:58.110
This is Melvin the Magnificent.

05:58.110 --> 06:02.155
And I know this heat's got all y'all
hurting' so bad.

06:02.155 --> 06:05.784
Have mercy on LA.
It's another hot one.

06:05.784 --> 06:09.871
Weatherman says it's over 100
and it's gonna stay that way.

06:09.871 --> 06:13.667
So I think, if we've gotta be
sweating all night,

06:13.667 --> 06:18.088
let it be in the arms
of the one you love. That's L-U-V.

06:18.088 --> 06:22.217
Right now, it's 8:25
and the last little bit

06:22.217 --> 06:25.387
of summer sunshine
is about to fall into the sea.

06:25.387 --> 06:28.765
And I, Melvin the Magnificent,
wanna have a word

06:28.765 --> 06:32.769
with all you fine people out there
in partyland.

06:32.769 --> 06:36.231
Now, get yourself
up close to the radio,

06:36.231 --> 06:40.026
cos I'm about to give you your
party instructions for the night.

06:40.026 --> 06:42.195
The first thing you wanna do

06:42.195 --> 06:44.906
is turn the lights
to red, green and blue.

06:44.906 --> 06:48.243
Then, when the moon is bright
and the moon is low,

06:48.243 --> 06:53.331
take your rhythm down
to a time that's real slow.

06:53.331 --> 06:55.375
(RADIO OFF)

06:59.463 --> 07:01.590
Susan...
Ray.

07:01.590 --> 07:04.634
No-one has the right to tell you
what to do with your life.

07:05.719 --> 07:08.388
Not Lonnie, not your mom and not me.

07:12.225 --> 07:14.352
I just wanna be part of your future.

07:14.352 --> 07:16.521
And it's not in Watts.

07:16.521 --> 07:19.983
Lonnie reminds me of that
every time I look in his eyes.

07:24.154 --> 07:26.198
I love you.

07:27.574 --> 07:29.951
And I won't spend my life
without you.

07:42.005 --> 07:43.131
Susan!

07:50.263 --> 07:53.266
You told me this was over.
We were studying and -

07:53.266 --> 07:56.478
I asked you to stay away from
my daughter. Now I'm telling you.

07:56.478 --> 07:59.314
I think -
I don't give a damn what you think.

07:59.314 --> 08:02.818
You just stay away from Susan.
Stop it, Daddy! Not under my roof.

08:02.818 --> 08:05.821
Then I'll move in with Ray!
No, wait a minute. Don't you think

08:05.821 --> 08:09.616
we should talk about this?
You don't want me to move in?
No, I didn't say that.

08:09.616 --> 08:13.078
He doesn't want you in Watts
any more than I do.
I didn't say that either!

08:13.078 --> 08:16.331
You stay away from him and
you stay outta that damn ghetto!

08:16.331 --> 08:18.875
I work there!
Susan.

08:18.875 --> 08:22.504
Coloureds are beating whites
in Watts right now.

08:22.504 --> 08:26.842
You think they won't
turn on you because you volunteered
for a couple of months?

08:26.842 --> 08:29.469
No! Because it's the 20th century!

08:29.469 --> 08:34.182
Because this is Los Angeles,
California. Not Redneck,
Mississippi 100 years ago!

08:34.182 --> 08:38.687
Negroes and whites
are getting married all the time.
It doesn't matter any more.

08:38.687 --> 08:41.690
It does to me.

08:41.690 --> 08:43.942
Now get in the house.

08:46.028 --> 08:49.573
Come on, Susan...
We'll work this out.

08:49.573 --> 08:53.285
The hell you will.
Go in the house, Susan. Please.

08:58.457 --> 09:02.377
Daddy. The only difference
between you and Lonnie
is the colour of your skin!

09:14.306 --> 09:16.516
When you first started
coming around here...

09:17.893 --> 09:20.020
..I tried...

09:20.020 --> 09:22.689
to deal with you as an individual.

09:22.689 --> 09:26.234
But then I realised I have to
deal with you for what you are.

09:28.028 --> 09:30.447
A coloured man
who's going to hurt my daughter.

09:30.447 --> 09:32.741
I'd never hurt Susan.

09:32.741 --> 09:34.910
But they will.
They?

09:34.910 --> 09:36.703
Your brothers...

09:36.703 --> 09:39.122
as that fanatic Malcolm X calls them.

09:39.122 --> 09:41.166
They will hurt her.

09:42.292 --> 09:44.836
And there won't be a thing
you'll be able to do to stop it.

09:58.016 --> 10:00.060
â™ª THE MIRACLES: Tracks Of My Tears

10:17.494 --> 10:20.956
How's it going, kid?
I'm black again, Al.

10:20.956 --> 10:22.749
I can tell (!)

10:23.917 --> 10:26.002
I'm a black man
engaged to a white girl.

10:26.002 --> 10:28.171
And nobody wants us together.

10:28.171 --> 10:31.425
Not her father or my brother
or any of his so-called friends.

10:31.425 --> 10:33.552
It's 1965, Sam.

10:33.552 --> 10:35.679
California may be as far to the left

10:35.679 --> 10:40.183
as you can go without leaving
the country, but there's still
a lot of ignorance and bigotry.

10:40.183 --> 10:44.187
What am I here to do?
We don't know. Ziggy's running
some scenarios on the riot.

10:44.187 --> 10:47.774
But he hasn't figured out
a way to plug you in yet. Riot?

10:47.774 --> 10:49.651
Don't you know where you are?

10:49.651 --> 10:53.196
Yeah. Watts.
It's August 11th 1965.

10:53.196 --> 10:56.950
One of the worst riots this country's
ever seen is about to go down
right here.

10:56.950 --> 10:59.119
I don't remember.

10:59.119 --> 11:02.122
A black man named Marquette Frye
gets arrested in Compton.

11:02.122 --> 11:04.541
That lit the fuse. When it was over,

11:04.541 --> 11:07.502
35 people were dead,
hundreds of people were injured

11:07.502 --> 11:10.505
and the main drag
became known as Charcoal Alley.

11:10.505 --> 11:12.591
Made me sick when it happened.

11:12.591 --> 11:17.471
Pushed the Civil Rights Amendment
and the Voting Rights Bill through
and then it all goes up in smoke.

11:17.471 --> 11:19.806
Maybe I'm here to stop the riots.
You can't!

11:19.806 --> 11:22.684
Marquette got arrested hours ago.
It's already started.

11:22.684 --> 11:25.103
It's too late.
I can warn people. I can warn 'em.

11:25.103 --> 11:28.023
Who will listen to a medical student?
Maybe my brother.

11:28.023 --> 11:31.610
Lonnie's a militant!
And you're his little brother.
He'll never listen.

11:31.610 --> 11:34.321
Nobody will ever listen to you.
Susan would. Susan?

11:34.321 --> 11:37.657
Have Ziggy run a scenario on
me and Susan Brewster.

11:37.657 --> 11:40.577
You mean Ray and Susan.
Yeah, right. Yeah.

11:40.577 --> 11:42.746
She loves him so much, Al.

11:42.746 --> 11:45.540
When she looks at me,
I feel like she wants to just...

11:45.540 --> 11:47.709
crawl inside and never come out.

11:47.709 --> 11:51.421
There was only one woman
that ever looked at me like that.

11:51.421 --> 11:55.550
Bingo. That's it, Sam.
Ziggy says 87% you're here
to keep Ray and Susan together.

11:55.550 --> 11:57.969
He lost Susan because of the riot.

11:57.969 --> 12:01.264
And when he lost her, he lost
his dream of becoming a doctor.

12:03.141 --> 12:06.186
That can't be right. She loves him
too much to give him up.

12:06.186 --> 12:09.022
How can you be sure of that?
No. No. She loves me, Al.

12:09.022 --> 12:11.191
Why do you say 'me'?

12:11.191 --> 12:14.152
You mean Ray, Don't you?
That's twice you've done that.

12:14.152 --> 12:16.321
Are you starting
to fall in love with Susan?

12:16.321 --> 12:18.490
No! It's just that...

12:18.490 --> 12:22.202
even though I just got here,
I can see how much she loves Ray.

12:22.202 --> 12:26.748
She wouldn't let anything part them.
The Watts riots were not just
anything, Sam.

12:28.458 --> 12:31.920
And we can't stop it?
No. We would've had
to come here 50 years ago.

12:31.920 --> 12:35.590
You said it started
when Frye was arrested.
It started when the first black

12:35.590 --> 12:39.219
couldn't find a job
or live where he wanted to.
It started when the first

12:39.219 --> 12:41.388
baby went hungry.

12:41.388 --> 12:44.391
Or the first cop hassled some guy,
just because he was black.

12:45.851 --> 12:48.061
This match has been burning
a long time, Sam.

12:48.061 --> 12:50.355
Oh, right.
It's Dr Moving Doo-Doo (!)

12:50.355 --> 12:53.233
You know, I figured out
exactly what your problem is.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.402
I don't...

12:55.402 --> 12:57.738
I don't have a problem.
Oh, yes, you do.

12:57.738 --> 13:01.825
You, my man, have forgotten
the fine flavour

13:01.825 --> 13:07.330
of sweet brown chocolate
melting down to the rhythm of a 45.

13:07.330 --> 13:09.458
Uh-huh.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.585
You need to party, my man.

13:11.585 --> 13:13.754
Party? There's a riot starting.

13:13.754 --> 13:16.256
I know.
It's right over at Sheri Hills'.

13:16.256 --> 13:19.009
Go with him, Sam.
I gotta get some data anyway.

13:19.009 --> 13:21.136
Come on.

13:21.136 --> 13:23.722
Forget Suzy Sunshine for one night.

13:23.722 --> 13:26.349
That's the data I'm gonna be getting.
Don't leave me!

13:26.349 --> 13:30.187
Ain't nobody leaving you, young
blood. You know, you need a vacation.

13:30.187 --> 13:33.565
However, I,
Papa D, the doctor of love,

13:33.565 --> 13:35.776
prescribe one major dose of partying.

13:35.776 --> 13:37.069
Come on.
Let's go see what Sheri's put on.

13:44.853 --> 13:46.980
Get down, y'all. Sheri?

13:46.980 --> 13:49.942
Lord, have mercy on my soul.

13:49.942 --> 13:52.819
Dr Strangelove has come to party (!)

13:52.819 --> 13:55.489
(CHUCKLES) Come on, sugar.
I've been waiting for you.

13:55.489 --> 13:57.616
Uh...

13:57.616 --> 13:59.826
You know um...

13:59.826 --> 14:03.497
I really shouldn't.
Put your arms around me,
like you used to in high school.

14:03.497 --> 14:05.540
And dip.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.794
Um...

14:08.794 --> 14:11.672
I really should...
uh, go home and...and study.

14:11.672 --> 14:13.840
Good. I could help you.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.635
Like I used to
with your anatomy lessons (!)

14:16.635 --> 14:18.762
(LAUGHS)

14:18.762 --> 14:20.973
I appreciate the offer, but um...

14:22.099 --> 14:24.268
..I'm engaged.

14:24.268 --> 14:28.188
You mean to tell me you're gonna
honestly marry that sugar cookie?

14:28.188 --> 14:30.941
Susan is a...is a very nice girl.

14:30.941 --> 14:33.443
And so am I,
if you'll let me show you.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.990
I um...

14:37.990 --> 14:40.158
I really think that you'd like her.

14:40.158 --> 14:42.286
Now, how am I
supposed to find that out?

14:42.286 --> 14:44.413
Is she gonna
invite me over for tea (?)

14:44.413 --> 14:46.832
Well, maybe.
Maybe you could invite her.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.168
Yeah. I'll put that
on my social calendar (!)

14:51.628 --> 14:53.797
But...until then um...

14:53.797 --> 14:56.508
what if you and I...

14:58.302 --> 15:00.429
Hey, listen up. Listen up!
Hey, man!

15:00.429 --> 15:03.140
Don't be busting up the party.
The party's over!

15:03.140 --> 15:06.143
It's my party and it's not over
until I say it's over!

15:06.143 --> 15:09.563
(SIREN) Shut up! Shut up and listen!
What is your problem, man?

15:09.563 --> 15:11.940
The streets are swarming with cops,
man.

15:11.940 --> 15:15.152
They're arresting brothers for
walking down the street. For what?

15:15.152 --> 15:17.321
Does it matter? Does it ever matter?

15:17.321 --> 15:19.531
They beat a pregnant woman
in the street

15:19.531 --> 15:22.576
cos she tried to stop two cops
from clubbing a black man.

15:22.576 --> 15:25.287
Lonnie, don't start this.
Start what, man?

15:25.287 --> 15:28.749
Are we gonna let a bunch of honky
cops stomp us into the ground, man,

15:28.749 --> 15:30.959
cos we're fighting back for once?

15:30.959 --> 15:33.587
We gotta take back our streets.

15:33.587 --> 15:35.756
You can't go out there.

15:35.756 --> 15:38.592
If the police are beating people,
you're just asking for it.

15:38.592 --> 15:41.261
It's the cops that are asking for it.
Use your head.

15:41.261 --> 15:43.639
People are gonna get hurt.
He may be right, man.

15:43.639 --> 15:45.849
You think Mr Charlie's right,
Papa D?

15:45.849 --> 15:48.936
I didn't say that. It's not about
that. It's about saving lives.

15:48.936 --> 15:51.104
You been running for Mr Charlie
for too long!

15:51.104 --> 15:53.273
He's been running us all too long!

15:53.273 --> 15:56.735
Telling us when to go home,
when to go to work.

15:56.735 --> 15:59.363
When to breathe (!)
We gotta take 'em down!

15:59.363 --> 16:01.490
Going out there is not the answer.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.867
You hide in this room, Ray. I can't.

16:03.867 --> 16:06.370
Not when the man
is beating our women.

16:06.370 --> 16:08.872
Not when the man
is imprisoning my brothers.

16:08.872 --> 16:11.541
I can't hide. I gotta fight!

16:12.626 --> 16:14.753
No!

16:14.753 --> 16:17.506
Move out the way, Charlie!

16:17.506 --> 16:19.633
(HUBBUB)

16:19.633 --> 16:21.760
Lonnie, wait!

16:21.760 --> 16:23.804
Come on, Lonnie. Stop!

16:25.347 --> 16:27.516
Lonnie!

16:27.516 --> 16:29.726
(SIREN)
Go home! Get in your house!

16:29.726 --> 16:32.354
Get inside!
Sam, there's nothing you can do.

16:33.981 --> 16:37.025
It's not your fault, Sam.
You're not here to stop the riot.

16:37.025 --> 16:39.653
You're here to see that
Ray and Susan stay together.

16:39.653 --> 16:42.447
People are dying, Al!
Well, Susan may be one of 'em.

16:42.447 --> 16:45.242
What? I don't know.
Ziggy's telling me now that

16:45.242 --> 16:48.495
there's a 32% chance that
she could die in the next 48 hours.

16:48.495 --> 16:51.832
Is it some history I changed?
No, I don't think so.

16:51.832 --> 16:55.502
The odds are still heavy that you're
here to keep Ray and Susan together.

16:55.502 --> 16:58.589
Now there's this outside chance
that maybe she could die.

16:58.589 --> 17:00.716
Oh, Ray!

17:00.716 --> 17:03.343
Thank God!

17:03.343 --> 17:05.304
What are you doing here?

17:05.304 --> 17:08.140
I saw what was happening on the news
and I got so afraid.

17:08.140 --> 17:10.976
I had this feeling something terrible
would happen to you.

17:10.976 --> 17:13.311
I tried to talk some sense into her.

17:13.311 --> 17:17.107
But she swore if I didn't bring her
down here, she'd come on her own.

17:17.107 --> 17:19.192
She's lucky she made it here alive,
Sam.

17:19.192 --> 17:21.653
You've gotta go home.
I can't.

17:21.653 --> 17:24.156
I left a note telling Daddy
I'm staying with you.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.826
Negroes aren't the only ones
going crazy tonight (!)

17:28.910 --> 17:31.079
She quit tonight.

17:31.079 --> 17:33.957
She said, after 11 years,
she didn't know who Daddy was.

17:37.377 --> 17:41.673
Susan. Susan, this is crazy.
I gotta get you home!

17:41.673 --> 17:45.218
Daddy was right.
You don't love me, do you?

17:45.218 --> 17:47.262
This has nothing to do with love!
It does!

17:47.262 --> 17:51.308
If you love me as much as I love you,
you'll want me with you
at a time like this.

17:51.308 --> 17:54.811
So I can worry about you being hurt?
Sam, carry on this discussion
inside.

17:54.811 --> 17:58.315
Get her off the street before she's
seen. You live there. Apartment 218.

17:58.315 --> 18:00.651
We gotta go inside!
(EXPLOSION)

18:30.347 --> 18:33.517
"The mayor will request that
the National Guard are called in."

18:33.517 --> 18:37.104
"Fire-bombings of retail stores
and businesses

18:37.104 --> 18:40.649
continue in the meantime
with no ending in sight."

18:41.942 --> 18:44.444
Matty had me hide
under an old quilt in the back seat.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.656
I almost told her to take me home,
but...

18:47.656 --> 18:49.783
I thought about you.

18:49.783 --> 18:51.952
About us.

18:51.952 --> 18:54.162
And none of it mattered.
It does matter!

18:54.162 --> 18:56.790
It's too dangerous for you here.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.960
People know me, Ray. I've worked
all summer at the health centre.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.755
Nobody cares about that now.
This is a riot, Susan.

19:03.755 --> 19:05.882
People don't care about
what you've done.

19:05.882 --> 19:08.135
They only see
the colour of your skin.

19:08.135 --> 19:10.721
Now, I'm gonna figure out
a way for you to get home.

19:10.721 --> 19:13.432
And when I do, I want you
to stay there. Not without you!

19:13.432 --> 19:17.519
I gotta stay here! No, you don't,
Ray. You don't belong here.
You're better than this.

19:17.519 --> 19:21.648
We can get a place on campus
until after our boards.
And then we go to Boston.

19:21.648 --> 19:23.734
She could be right, Sam.
No!

19:23.734 --> 19:25.569
I can't explain. I gotta stay.

19:27.279 --> 19:30.949
Then so will I. Until I can
talk some sense into you.

19:30.949 --> 19:32.993
WOMAN: Lonnie?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.247
Somebody!

19:37.247 --> 19:39.416
Lean on me.

19:39.416 --> 19:41.543
Sam, that's Ray's mother.
Your mother!

19:41.543 --> 19:44.379
We were coming up on a bus on...
(INDISTINCT)

19:44.379 --> 19:48.091
Easy. All of a sudden,
there was all these people
in the middle of the street.

19:48.091 --> 19:51.386
They were...screaming and
throwing rocks and bottles at us.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.140
I thought they were gonna
turn over that bus.

19:57.893 --> 20:01.521
They grabbed the driver...
and they started breaking windows.

20:01.521 --> 20:03.774
There was police everywhere!

20:05.692 --> 20:07.778
I don't know how I got off that bus.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.448
I don't know how I even got home!

20:17.621 --> 20:20.207
Susan! Oh, Lord, child!
What you doing here?

20:21.291 --> 20:23.418
I wanted to be with Ray.

20:23.418 --> 20:25.545
You gotta get her outta here.

20:25.545 --> 20:27.589
They'll kill her, if they see her!

20:28.674 --> 20:30.801
(EXPLOSION)

20:30.801 --> 20:33.553
Oh, no, no. What's that?

20:36.598 --> 20:40.269
What in God's name
is happening to us?

21:24.521 --> 21:27.107
Ray? Ray, honey. Wake up.

21:28.775 --> 21:31.111
Electricity came on around seven.

21:31.111 --> 21:33.405
I think the coffee's still hot.

21:33.405 --> 21:35.532
What time is it?

21:35.532 --> 21:38.035
Eleven. I tried to wake you, but...

21:38.035 --> 21:40.454
Where's Susan?
I shooed her off to your room.

21:40.454 --> 21:42.497
She's still asleep.

21:44.750 --> 21:46.919
I guess I'd better call her father.

21:46.919 --> 21:49.004
It don't work.
Huh?

21:49.004 --> 21:51.089
I saw the repair trucks, but...

21:52.341 --> 21:55.636
Well, folks pulled the driver out
and... You know.

21:56.678 --> 21:59.556
Back in Mariposa,
it was the white man's hatred.

21:59.556 --> 22:03.018
Now it's the Negroes angry
about what's supposed to be.

22:04.102 --> 22:06.855
Seems no matter where we go,
we can't get away from the hate.

22:08.565 --> 22:11.944
Maybe it's not the place that makes
the difference, but the people.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.697
That's why you being a doctor here
is so important.

22:15.697 --> 22:19.034
Show these kids in the street
they can be somebody better.

22:20.118 --> 22:22.287
In a way, that's what Lonnie wants.

22:24.039 --> 22:26.166
That boy troubles me.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.543
So much hate, and yet he cares.

22:28.543 --> 22:32.422
He cares, Ray. Or he wouldn't
be working so hard to
put you through school.

22:34.508 --> 22:36.635
He's afraid I won't stay here.

22:36.635 --> 22:38.762
Oh, you won't go!

22:38.762 --> 22:40.889
I raised you better than that.

22:40.889 --> 22:43.058
You won't go.

22:43.058 --> 22:46.520
God gave you a gift
to make these streets better.

22:48.021 --> 22:50.232
You won't go.

22:51.817 --> 22:53.944
Unless she takes you away.

22:53.944 --> 22:56.029
I just want what's best for Ray.

23:00.409 --> 23:02.577
I love Ray, Mamma Harper.

23:02.577 --> 23:06.081
And I don't wanna see him lose
his chance to be someone great.

23:06.081 --> 23:08.542
He can be great right here.
No, he can't.

23:08.542 --> 23:11.211
He can do good here,
but he can't be great.

23:11.211 --> 23:13.380
Um... Sometimes...

23:13.380 --> 23:16.425
Sometimes doing good
is more important.

23:16.425 --> 23:20.470
Ray, do you wanna spend your life
in Watts, raise our children in it?

23:20.470 --> 23:23.640
Raising your children is gonna be
hard, no matter where you do it.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.559
Why?
Because wherever you go,

23:25.559 --> 23:29.646
they won't fit in - they won't
be black and they won't be white.

23:29.646 --> 23:32.858
They'll be human.
Of course they'll be human, child.

23:32.858 --> 23:35.569
I'm talking about race.
Yeah, I know.

23:35.569 --> 23:40.365
But maybe, if we teach our kids
to say that they're human,

23:40.365 --> 23:45.120
instead of black or white or red
or yellow, maybe race won't matter.

23:45.996 --> 23:48.332
(SCOFFS)
Not in my lifetime!

23:51.251 --> 23:53.795
Ray, what the hell is she doing here?

23:53.795 --> 23:56.673
What are you boys
doing in my house with guns?

23:56.673 --> 23:58.800
She shouldn't be here.
She could get hurt.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.845
Our brothers are dying, and
you're worried about this racist?

24:01.845 --> 24:04.348
Susan ain't no racist.
What's she doing here, Ray?

24:04.348 --> 24:06.433
She came to be with me.
Why?

24:06.433 --> 24:10.103
To ease your jaw (?)
Bebe! Cut it, Bebe!

24:10.103 --> 24:14.149
See what her being here does?
It's not her that does it.

24:14.149 --> 24:17.069
What happened?
We burnt out Weintraub's Market.

24:17.069 --> 24:20.614
Mr Weintraub's been in this store
for over 30 years.

24:20.614 --> 24:23.533
Why you have to burn him out?
Cos he's just another cracker

24:23.533 --> 24:27.955
stealing money from black folks
that ain't giving a damn thing back.
It was wrong!

24:27.955 --> 24:30.540
Jimmy Parsons has worked there
as long as I can recall.

24:30.540 --> 24:32.709
As a stock boy!

24:32.709 --> 24:35.212
Why don't you ask him how he feels
now he has no work?

24:35.212 --> 24:38.048
You'd think the old Jew would've
trusted him after 15 years.

24:38.048 --> 24:39.925
Taught him more than sweeping up.

24:39.925 --> 24:42.928
Maybe he just needed
someone to suggest the idea.

24:46.723 --> 24:49.184
This is gonna need stitches.
Then, sew it!

24:49.184 --> 24:52.145
Or has all that money
that Lonnie's been working for

24:52.145 --> 24:55.440
to get you through medical school
all these years been for nothing?

24:55.440 --> 24:58.151
You don't make it real easy
to wanna help you, Bebe.

24:58.151 --> 25:01.863
And gratitude ain't enough. Do it cos
you're a black man, and so is he.

25:01.863 --> 25:04.241
Being black has nothing to do
with helping him.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.411
I'm doing it because, if I don't,
he's gonna bleed to death.

25:07.411 --> 25:11.206
I've got a sewing kit in my room.
There's needles and sutures
at the clinic.

25:11.206 --> 25:13.250
My God. That's where we should be.

25:13.250 --> 25:17.296
If we can't stop what's happening,
we can at least help the people
it's happening to.

25:17.296 --> 25:19.756
How will we get in?
Only Dr Michaels has a key.

25:19.756 --> 25:23.135
The one thing we don't need
in Watts right now is a key (!)

25:56.492 --> 25:58.744
OK. Let's take a look at this arm,
huh?

25:58.744 --> 26:00.913
All right.

26:00.913 --> 26:03.875
Yeah, OK.
Susan, I'm gonna need some splints.

26:03.875 --> 26:07.545
We used the last one. I'll see if
I can improvise something.

26:07.545 --> 26:09.672
OK. Momma, get me some tape.
Right, Ray.

26:09.672 --> 26:12.717
You OK?
(I feel like a doctor.)

26:12.717 --> 26:15.470
It's great!
Somebody, please!

26:15.470 --> 26:18.222
Help my baby!
He's burnt pretty bad, Ray.

26:18.222 --> 26:20.808
All right. You go take over there.
I got him, I got him.

26:20.808 --> 26:23.019
Easy. All right. What happened?

26:23.019 --> 26:25.480
We were staying in the shoe store.

26:25.480 --> 26:28.775
And it just blew up.
Glass went flying everywhere.

26:30.735 --> 26:33.446
You're a lucky guy.
We're gonna take care of this.

26:33.446 --> 26:35.490
Susan, I need your help.

26:38.743 --> 26:40.953
Get that honky away from my son!

26:40.953 --> 26:44.207
Get away from my child!
She's gonna help me.
I don't need help from her!

26:46.918 --> 26:49.045
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:49.045 --> 26:51.088
OK. Uh...

26:52.215 --> 26:55.384
Momma and I, we'll take care of him.
We'll take care of him, child.

26:55.384 --> 26:57.553
It's OK.

26:57.553 --> 26:59.722
It's OK, buddy.
All right. I got you.

27:01.682 --> 27:03.726
Momma, get me scissors, sutures.

27:13.486 --> 27:15.530
(HELICOPTER OVERHEAD)

27:20.868 --> 27:22.870
(DISTANT SIREN)

27:39.554 --> 27:41.597
See, Ray?

27:43.141 --> 27:45.184
You see what it'd be like?

27:46.269 --> 27:48.437
Susan.

27:48.437 --> 27:51.190
You helped a lot of people today
who appreciated it.

27:51.190 --> 27:54.944
Did they, Ray?
That's not what I saw in their eyes.

27:54.944 --> 27:57.447
I saw anger and hatred.

27:57.447 --> 28:00.908
They tolerated me only because
they were hurting and needed help.

28:00.908 --> 28:03.202
No. How would you know?
You're one of them!

28:07.874 --> 28:09.834
You're tired,
or you wouldn't say that.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.588
Maybe that's when
the truth comes out.

28:16.174 --> 28:21.053
I can't go through life
fighting people who hate me
for the colour of my skin.

28:25.183 --> 28:28.144
I think that's how everybody
in Watts must feel tonight.

28:28.144 --> 28:30.813
Your mother was right.

28:30.813 --> 28:32.899
We'll never be
just a husband and wife.

28:34.025 --> 28:36.778
We'll be a black husband
and a white wife.

28:36.778 --> 28:39.071
And neither race
will ever let us forget it.

28:40.823 --> 28:42.992
All that matters is that we do.

28:42.992 --> 28:46.370
I'm not sure any more, Ray.
I'm just not sure.

28:46.370 --> 28:48.998
Ray! Ray!

28:48.998 --> 28:51.042
He's bleeding bad, man!

28:58.488 --> 29:01.908
Hit on me, if it'll help.
Get the police.
They can take him to a hospital.

29:21.515 --> 29:24.685
They're the ones that shot him!
She's right. Call the police!

29:24.685 --> 29:25.728
No!

29:26.979 --> 29:29.190
Fine. If you won't, I will!

29:31.525 --> 29:33.986
It's too late.

29:33.986 --> 29:35.738
He's dead.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.387
No more black people die.

30:36.387 --> 30:39.348
I pray to God you're right.

30:39.348 --> 30:41.517
I'm right, Momma.

30:41.517 --> 30:44.979
I'm gonna see
no more black people die.

30:46.814 --> 30:48.524
Lonnie?

30:49.650 --> 30:51.777
Any more brothers die...

30:54.864 --> 30:57.158
..then she dies!
Ray!

31:23.737 --> 31:26.156
You ain't gonna kill my boy.

31:31.730 --> 31:34.191
Stop it, Bebe. 
Bebe, I said stop it!

31:45.577 --> 31:47.704
Go find him, Ray.

31:47.704 --> 31:49.748
Where'd he take her, Bebe?

31:53.376 --> 31:55.420
I don't know.

32:02.093 --> 32:04.137
You fools!

32:05.555 --> 32:07.682
You boys, you're all fools!

32:14.231 --> 32:17.526
LOUDHAILER: This is the police.
Return to your homes!

32:17.526 --> 32:19.903
Return to your homes!

32:51.149 --> 32:53.234
Al!
My God!

32:53.234 --> 32:55.987
Susan. 
Where's Susan?

32:55.987 --> 32:58.114
You don't know?
Lonnie took her hostage.

32:58.114 --> 33:00.658
He's gonna execute her
if another black is killed.

33:00.658 --> 33:02.452
So that's what happened.
What?

33:02.452 --> 33:05.747
That's why I came. The odds
on Susan dying just jumped to 82%.

33:05.747 --> 33:08.291
Can't Ziggy get a lock on her?

33:08.291 --> 33:11.669
He could barely get a lock on you.
That's what took me so long.

33:12.837 --> 33:14.964
(SIREN AND GUNSHOT)

33:19.636 --> 33:22.347
Get outta here quick!
It's the cops! Run, run, run!

33:22.347 --> 33:24.015
Go! Go!

33:31.314 --> 33:34.526
"Rumours are rampant.
One of the most disturbing

33:34.526 --> 33:39.030
is that the white daughter
of a police captain is being
held hostage in Watts

33:39.030 --> 33:43.284
and will be executed if another
Negro is killed by police."

33:43.284 --> 33:45.328
Bebe got the word out.

33:47.205 --> 33:49.290
Daddy can't stop this.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.794
You'd better pray he can.

33:52.794 --> 33:56.005
Killing me will only make it worse.

33:57.257 --> 34:00.051
For who (?)

34:05.265 --> 34:07.308
(RUMBLING)
Look out there.

34:09.143 --> 34:11.187
Can it get any worse than that?

34:12.272 --> 34:13.940
No.

34:55.954 --> 34:58.123
You know they'll come after you.

34:58.123 --> 34:59.958
I'm ready.

35:01.501 --> 35:03.670
You're gonna 
kill me no matter what.

35:03.670 --> 35:06.840
If your daddy stops murdering
my people, I'll let you go.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.426
He can't stop
what's happening out there!

35:11.928 --> 35:13.179
No.

35:15.974 --> 35:17.892
I don't suppose he can.

35:35.747 --> 35:37.874
Sam! Over here!

35:37.874 --> 35:40.168
Ziggy found her.
They're in your apartment.

35:40.168 --> 35:42.963
I'm lost, Al. It's two blocks east,
one block north.

35:42.963 --> 35:45.215
Go to her.
I'm gone.

36:20.459 --> 36:23.045
Keep looking.
Reports are seeing Susan everywhere.

36:23.045 --> 36:25.214
He could be anywhere.

36:25.214 --> 36:28.467
"Take it easy. We'll find her."
Can you stifle the reporters?

36:28.467 --> 36:32.805
"Yes. The media will withhold
announcing any more deaths
until Susan is safe."

36:32.805 --> 36:37.059
Good. I've ordered my men to pull
back and fire only if fired upon.

36:37.059 --> 36:39.187
"Paul, you can't do that."

36:39.187 --> 36:41.314
The hell I can't. That's my daughter!

36:47.904 --> 36:49.906
I need some help over here!
Gimme a hand!

36:56.287 --> 36:58.456
Where's Susan? Ray!

36:58.456 --> 37:01.000
Ray, look at me! Where's Susan?

37:02.752 --> 37:04.795
Lonnie's got her.

37:06.297 --> 37:09.217
He just wants the killing to stop.
Tell me where he's got her.

37:10.593 --> 37:12.678
Tell me!
Not unless I go with you.

37:12.678 --> 37:15.431
Ray! Where is she?

37:15.431 --> 37:18.434
Please.
(GUNSHOT)

37:51.550 --> 37:54.511
"There have been no reported deaths
in the last two hours."

37:54.511 --> 37:56.597
"But the violence
seems to be escalating."

37:58.307 --> 38:01.393
"The National Guard
will be called in by morning."

38:01.393 --> 38:03.854
Come on, Sam. Come on!

38:03.854 --> 38:06.023
"This is the police, Lonnie."

38:06.023 --> 38:09.318
"Put your weapon down
and step to the window

38:09.318 --> 38:11.570
with your hands on your head."

38:22.294 --> 38:24.421
Sir.
Oh, thank God.

38:24.421 --> 38:26.799
He's holding her
in that 2nd floor apartment.

38:29.092 --> 38:31.136
That roof will do.

38:32.471 --> 38:34.640
That's my daughter up there.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.767
I won't shoot
unless it's a sure kill.

38:36.767 --> 38:39.436
Get back there.
Clear those civilians outta here now!

38:42.940 --> 38:44.858
Lonnie?

38:48.153 --> 38:50.322
It's Ray.

38:50.322 --> 38:53.742
I'm coming in.
He's right behind the door.

39:05.402 --> 39:07.446
POLICE: There is no way out!

40:21.970 --> 40:23.972
You can die for Watts.

40:23.972 --> 40:25.974
But can you live for it?

40:25.974 --> 40:27.934
You're talking like a fool!

40:27.934 --> 40:29.644
You're acting like one.

40:32.147 --> 40:34.316
I need you, Lonnie.

40:35.942 --> 40:37.986
Momma needs you.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.281
We all need you.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.410
We need you to make people listen.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.582
I think you're reaching him, Sam.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.967
Give me the gun, Lonnie.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.346
Please.

41:05.472 --> 41:08.183
Her daddy's killing us out there!

41:08.183 --> 41:10.227
Then be better than he is!

41:11.311 --> 41:13.855
Be more just...and more right...

41:15.065 --> 41:19.027
..and stay alive to make sure
that what happens out there
never happens again.

41:19.027 --> 41:22.906
"Just in. Snipers on the corner
of 103rd and Compton

41:22.906 --> 41:26.660
were shot after
an intense gun battle with police."

41:26.660 --> 41:29.663
"The snipers were taken
to LA General,

41:29.663 --> 41:32.666
where their condition is unknown
at this time."

41:32.666 --> 41:35.585
Unknown? "We'll bring
you updates on their condition..."

41:35.585 --> 41:37.838
Those brothers are dead!

41:48.223 --> 41:52.227
Come on. Come on, move your head.
Let me have a shot. Go on.

41:52.227 --> 41:54.271
I love her, Lonnie.

41:57.399 --> 42:01.820
And I can't believe...that
my brother would murder what I love.

42:23.300 --> 42:25.343
Madness.

42:43.074 --> 42:44.784
Thank God.

42:48.956 --> 42:51.208
Oh, get out of my face.

42:52.335 --> 42:54.462
Both of you.

42:54.462 --> 42:56.505
Just get out of my face.

43:13.214 --> 43:15.717
(SUSAN SCREAMS)

43:18.261 --> 43:21.097
He let me go! 
He let me go!

43:38.869 --> 43:41.163
You didn't have to kill him!

43:42.331 --> 43:44.708
He...he was going to shoot you,
Susan.

43:49.777 --> 43:51.821
Lonnie!

43:52.905 --> 43:54.699
Why does he have to die?

44:02.659 --> 44:04.702
It can't be for nothing, Al.

44:06.955 --> 44:09.165
I can't let his death
be for nothing.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.293
I have to stay in Watts.

44:14.656 --> 44:17.618
Ray has to stay in Watts.
 Not you.

44:17.618 --> 44:19.870
I have to stay!

44:29.272 --> 44:31.399
Sam...

44:31.399 --> 44:33.401
you did it.

44:34.938 --> 44:36.982
Is it worth that?

44:41.945 --> 44:43.989
Was it enough?

45:12.565 --> 45:16.694
WOMAN: And now...
for the sword of doom!

45:16.694 --> 45:18.029
Doom?
