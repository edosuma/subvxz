00:01.434 --> 00:03.367
For the last time,
the best cop movies,

00:03.368 --> 00:05.168
in order: Training day,

00:05.169 --> 00:07.003
lethal weapon, and Fargo.

00:07.004 --> 00:08.704
- End of discussion.
- Wrong.

00:08.738 --> 00:11.439
Die hard is the best
cop movie of all time.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.307
One cop heroically
saving the day

00:13.308 --> 00:15.208
while everyone else
stands around and watches.

00:15.209 --> 00:16.809
It's the story of my life.

00:16.843 --> 00:18.276
I like Turner & Hooch.

00:18.277 --> 00:20.778
Tom Hanks, reluctant
friendship with a dog.

00:20.779 --> 00:22.779
That hits me where I live.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.314
No. Robocop.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.716
It's got everything I like...
Gratuitous violence.

00:27.952 --> 00:29.220
Oh, I thought
you were listing things.

00:29.221 --> 00:30.655
- I was. I'm done.
- Okay.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.124
Let's talk bad boys.
That's the perfect cop movie.

00:33.125 --> 00:35.125
Mr. Smith, lookin' fine.

00:35.126 --> 00:38.262
A hot cup of tea Leone.
Come on.

00:38.263 --> 00:40.999
Francois Truffaut's
breathless.

00:41.031 --> 00:42.098
What?

00:42.132 --> 00:44.232
Terry likes
foreign films.

00:44.267 --> 00:46.267
Mm-kay. There is
a correct answer

00:46.268 --> 00:47.467
to this question, though.

00:47.502 --> 00:49.603
So gather around
for the greatest cop film

00:49.604 --> 00:50.902
of all time.

00:50.903 --> 00:53.304
Please refrain from texting
during our presentation.

00:53.339 --> 00:54.438
(Man)
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:54.439 --> 00:55.773
All right,
so there's Hitchcock.

00:55.774 --> 00:56.840
And there's an old hooker.

00:56.841 --> 00:58.174
There it is!

00:58.175 --> 00:59.351
Come on, guys,
that happened four years ago.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.342
Shh, this is
the best part.

01:01.343 --> 01:03.144
Takes the wallet
and here she goes!

01:03.145 --> 01:06.145

01:28.063 --> 01:29.131
Hey, love the sweater.

01:29.164 --> 01:31.466
Who you slayin' tonight,
lady killer?

01:31.467 --> 01:34.469
Well, we shall see
what we shall see.

01:34.504 --> 01:37.506
No, you're dressed exactly
like the lady killer.

01:37.507 --> 01:39.016
Damn it!

01:39.041 --> 01:41.976
This is Jeffrey Dahmer's
corduroys all over again.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.612
All right, let's get started.
Scully.

01:44.647 --> 01:47.315
Where are you on digitizing
the old case files?

01:47.316 --> 01:50.384
As of yesterday,
I'm officially 1% done.

01:50.385 --> 01:51.737
Why are you smiling?

01:51.753 --> 01:52.988
That's nothin'.

01:53.021 --> 01:54.088
There are thousands
of cases,

01:54.089 --> 01:55.624
and for each one,
I have to fill out

01:55.625 --> 01:58.493
200 little box thingies
on 50 different screens.

01:58.527 --> 01:59.995
At least you get
to sit on your butt all day.

02:00.029 --> 02:01.329
That's actually
the worst part.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.248
My doctor said
I have an anal canyon.

02:03.265 --> 02:04.875
Ugh, God, Scully,

02:04.900 --> 02:06.234
why are you always
telling us

02:06.235 --> 02:07.569
about your disgusting
body?

02:07.603 --> 02:08.669
I don't see anything.

02:08.705 --> 02:10.464
That's because
it's all wart.

02:10.473 --> 02:14.009
[Retching]

02:14.011 --> 02:15.512
How are you married?

02:15.546 --> 02:18.805
Peralta, where are we
on the Adams street burglary?

02:18.816 --> 02:19.949
We are very close,
Captain.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.018
Aside from a complete
absence of evidence,

02:22.019 --> 02:23.619
suspects, or leads.

02:23.620 --> 02:25.896
So, in conclusion,
not at all close.

02:25.923 --> 02:27.957
And the Vickers street
aggravated assault?

02:27.958 --> 02:30.092
Stalled out,
and the Calloway robbery

02:30.093 --> 02:31.126
also remains unsolved...

02:31.127 --> 02:34.496
Due to a lack
of solving it by me.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.033
Sounds like someone's
in a little bit of a slump.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.300
I'm not in a slump.

02:38.301 --> 02:40.569
You're not?
Scoreboard.

02:40.570 --> 02:42.705
I don't slump, people.

02:42.706 --> 02:44.207
I opposite slump.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.242
I p-muls.

02:46.243 --> 02:47.584
That's "slump" backwards,

02:47.612 --> 02:49.146
and it's what I do.

02:49.147 --> 02:52.282
I p-muls
all over this bitch.

02:52.283 --> 02:53.283
Dismissed.

02:53.284 --> 02:55.300
- Slump.
- P-muls!

02:57.385 --> 02:59.756
Wait... before
you say anything,

02:59.757 --> 03:01.425
I want to guess what happened,
based on your face.

03:01.426 --> 03:02.659
Someone died.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.461
No! You won a prize!

03:04.462 --> 03:05.595
I'm not getting
better at this.

03:05.596 --> 03:07.397
I'm concerned
that the open cases

03:07.398 --> 03:08.665
mound of garbage
on your desk

03:08.666 --> 03:10.767
has become so much higher
than the closed cases

03:10.768 --> 03:12.669
- mound of garbage.
- All right, sir.

03:12.670 --> 03:13.903
Let me hit you
with a little analogy.

03:13.904 --> 03:15.195
Are you familiar
with race cars?

03:15.205 --> 03:16.655
Formula 1 or stock?

03:16.673 --> 03:18.574
That's already way more
than I know about it.

03:18.575 --> 03:20.776
The point is,
I'm a super-awesome race car

03:20.777 --> 03:22.578
who's hit a couple
of unlucky speed bumps.

03:22.613 --> 03:23.947
You got speed bumps
on a race track?

03:23.948 --> 03:25.315
Is that not part
of car racing?

03:25.316 --> 03:26.482
It should be.

03:26.483 --> 03:28.384
All I'm saying is,
it's open road again.

03:28.385 --> 03:30.086
I'm about to close a case.

03:30.087 --> 03:32.088
Missing grandma
Helen Sterrino.

03:32.089 --> 03:34.424
Last Sunday,
her grandson Judd reported

03:34.425 --> 03:36.692
she went out for bagels
and never came back.

03:36.693 --> 03:38.394
This morning,
we picked up an old lady

03:38.395 --> 03:40.129
matching
her description exactly.

03:40.130 --> 03:42.265
I showed her pictures
of Judd, and she said,

03:42.266 --> 03:43.433
and I quote,

03:43.434 --> 03:47.437
[imitating old lady]
"That's my grandson."

03:47.438 --> 03:48.805
What did I say
about doing voices?

03:48.806 --> 03:50.073
I'm a storyteller, sir.

03:50.074 --> 03:51.742
It's my craft.

03:51.743 --> 03:53.477
Anyways,
grandson's coming in.

03:53.511 --> 03:54.978
They reunite,
and I throw another case

03:54.979 --> 03:56.680
on the old "solved it" pile.

04:00.150 --> 04:01.484
Hey, my croissant.

04:03.187 --> 04:04.787
[Heavy thuds]

04:04.788 --> 04:07.023
[Crunch]

04:07.024 --> 04:08.491
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

04:08.525 --> 04:10.360
Yes, the D.A. wanted me
to personally thank you

04:10.361 --> 04:12.462
for your work on
the Jay street drug bust.

04:12.463 --> 04:14.164
That's why we do this, sir.

04:14.165 --> 04:15.332
For praise?

04:15.366 --> 04:16.833
Uh...

04:16.867 --> 04:18.101
There's a community
outreach program

04:18.101 --> 04:19.369
that's very important
to me.

04:19.370 --> 04:21.004
I was wondering if you'd
like to head it up.

04:21.038 --> 04:23.573
Absolutely, sir.

04:23.574 --> 04:24.941
I won't just head it up,

04:24.942 --> 04:26.676
I will
head and shoulders it up.

04:26.677 --> 04:28.944
I will dive in,
swim around it,

04:28.945 --> 04:32.648
and just be altogether
good with it.

04:32.649 --> 04:35.284
Be more articulate when you
speak to the children.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.152
Yes, sir, I
will make better mouth.

04:39.455 --> 04:41.656
Hey, sarge, I need someone
to fill out a lineup.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.291
Will you be scary Terry?

04:43.292 --> 04:45.627
Oh, I love
being scary Terry.

04:45.628 --> 04:47.412
He says what regular
Terry's thinking.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.364
This is takin' too long!

04:49.365 --> 04:51.767
I'm gonna miss
the farmer's market!

04:51.768 --> 04:52.901
But I'm too busy.

04:52.902 --> 04:54.803
I've got a special case
I'm working on.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.205
Uh, Hitchcock,

04:56.206 --> 04:57.673
Boyle needs you
to fill out a lineup.

04:57.674 --> 04:59.675
Oh, great.
I'll take my shirt off.

04:59.676 --> 05:01.077
No one asked you
to take your shirt off.

05:01.078 --> 05:03.412
Stop volunteering
to take your shirt off.

05:03.447 --> 05:05.581
I can't hear you!
Shirt's over my ears.

05:05.616 --> 05:07.083
Hi, Rosa.

05:07.084 --> 05:08.851
Ooh, I like your shoes.
They're a really pretty...

05:08.852 --> 05:11.187
- What do you need?
- Color. Okay.

05:11.188 --> 05:12.822
You know how, every year,
the precinct does

05:12.823 --> 05:14.457
that Junior police
program seminar?

05:14.458 --> 05:16.192
That thing where we try
to get a bunch of loser kids

05:16.193 --> 05:18.160
to become student snitches?

05:18.161 --> 05:20.729
No, the thing where we
try to get at-risk kids...

05:20.730 --> 05:22.932
- Losers.
- To sign up to become Junior police officers.

05:22.933 --> 05:24.701
Snitches. What about it?

05:24.702 --> 05:26.403
Captain specifically
asked me to run it this year.

05:26.437 --> 05:27.737
I signed you up
to do it with me.

05:27.738 --> 05:28.738
Here's the info.

05:28.739 --> 05:30.206
Now I gotta read something?

05:30.207 --> 05:31.974
Greetings.
Fine.

05:32.009 --> 05:34.310
I guess I can help you
with those at-risk kids.

05:34.311 --> 05:35.745
[Scoffs]
I don't need your help.

05:35.779 --> 05:37.213
It's nothing personal,
it's just...

05:37.214 --> 05:39.715
You're not a cop,
so I'm not really sure

05:39.716 --> 05:40.849
- you could help.
- Okay.

05:40.850 --> 05:41.850
No hard feelings.

05:41.851 --> 05:43.017
But I hate you.

05:43.018 --> 05:44.786
Not joking. Bye.

05:45.955 --> 05:47.022
[Distant siren]

05:47.023 --> 05:48.624
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.058
I'm glad you're here.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.727
May I present to you...
[Imitates trumpet fanfare]

05:51.728 --> 05:55.530
Oh, my darlings.
Thank God I found you.

05:55.531 --> 05:58.467
Oh, look at
those beautiful cheeks.

05:58.502 --> 06:00.102
I have no idea
who this lady is.

06:00.103 --> 06:02.237
I've never seen her
before in my life.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.405
What?
No, she recognized you.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.473
This is Helen.
Who's Helen?

06:06.508 --> 06:09.141
Oh! That's my husband.

06:09.142 --> 06:10.776
Solomon!

06:10.777 --> 06:12.577
I'm... I'm not really
her husband.

06:12.578 --> 06:15.580
You're so much shorter
than you used to be.

06:15.581 --> 06:17.783
What did the Japanese
do to you?

06:17.817 --> 06:19.518
Different generation.

06:19.552 --> 06:21.687
Okay, this
is Ethel Musterberg

06:21.688 --> 06:23.756
from the prospect heights
senior center.

06:23.757 --> 06:25.958
There was an I.D. card
in her back pocket.

06:25.959 --> 06:27.927
Why was your hand
in her back pocket?

06:27.961 --> 06:30.196
Well, she told me
she didn't have any I.D.,

06:30.197 --> 06:31.698
and, unlike Boyle,
my first instinct

06:31.699 --> 06:33.499
was not to caress
her butt.

06:33.534 --> 06:36.034
Frisked!
I frisked her butt!

06:36.035 --> 06:39.037
It looks like this case
remains unsolved, Peralta.

06:39.038 --> 06:41.406
Oh, my God.

06:41.407 --> 06:43.475
I'm in a slump!

06:46.280 --> 06:48.736
Oh, cool. You're all here
in the break room.

06:48.737 --> 06:50.076
You asked us
to come in here.

06:50.105 --> 06:52.140
What? Here's
a hypothetical question.

06:52.141 --> 06:53.608
Let's say
I knew someone

06:53.609 --> 06:55.076
that, for the first time
in their career,

06:55.077 --> 06:57.879
was experiencing,
like, a minor slump.

06:57.913 --> 06:59.180
What do you think
you would suggest

06:59.214 --> 07:01.082
to that person if they
were going through that?

07:01.083 --> 07:03.852
Well, I haven't really been
in a slump since my divorce.

07:03.853 --> 07:06.255
So I'd tell this person,
"maybe get divorced."

07:06.256 --> 07:07.723
He'd have to
get married first.

07:07.724 --> 07:09.091
Okay, so the suggestion
to beat

07:09.092 --> 07:11.059
is get married
and then divorced.

07:11.060 --> 07:12.327
Rosa?

07:12.361 --> 07:13.928
Fly to Montreal,
hit a classy hotel bar,

07:13.929 --> 07:15.430
bone a stranger,
slump over.

07:15.464 --> 07:16.965
Wow, that sounds
amazing.

07:16.966 --> 07:17.966
- Yeah.
- That's a good one.

07:17.967 --> 07:19.167
Sarge, what would
you do?

07:19.201 --> 07:20.335
10,000 sit-ups.

07:20.336 --> 07:21.737
Okay, do you have
a backup plan

07:21.738 --> 07:24.273
in case my hypothetical
person can only do

07:24.274 --> 07:26.375
9,500, or 3?

07:26.409 --> 07:27.877
What's going on
in here?

07:27.878 --> 07:30.213
We're helping Jake's friend
got out of his slump.

07:30.214 --> 07:32.348
Or try working a case
until it's solved, Peralta.

07:32.382 --> 07:34.584
I always find
that closing cases

07:34.585 --> 07:37.186
is the best way
to end the slump.

07:37.221 --> 07:39.588
Thank you, Captain!
He's right.

07:39.623 --> 07:41.023
You just need a win.

07:41.024 --> 07:42.491
Pick your easiest,
no-brainer case,

07:42.492 --> 07:43.692
and work it
till it's done.

07:43.693 --> 07:44.893
Fine!

07:44.894 --> 07:46.962
Right after I do
Rosa's Montreal sex thing.

07:46.963 --> 07:48.364
That sounds fun.
Yeah.

07:49.833 --> 07:53.636
Okay, this is
the Junior police program.

Aka "mission possible."

[Spy music plays on TV]

07:59.443 --> 08:02.311
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

08:02.312 --> 08:05.047
is to get your life
back on track.

08:05.048 --> 08:06.782

Narc!

08:06.783 --> 08:08.417
[Laughter]
Hey, Gina.

08:08.451 --> 08:09.885
What are you doing?
Oh, hi, Amy.

08:09.919 --> 08:12.254
Since I have nothing to offer,
and since I'm not a cop,

08:12.255 --> 08:14.323
I thought I'd just
show up and learn.

08:14.324 --> 08:15.458
Do you wanna
help me out here?

08:15.459 --> 08:18.294
Nah, I think I'm good.

08:18.295 --> 08:21.331
I know you think
getting in trouble is cool.

08:21.332 --> 08:23.066
But let me show you
what can happen

08:23.100 --> 08:25.001
if you continue
down this path.

08:25.035 --> 08:26.736
Hey, yo,
I'm an at-risk kid,

08:26.737 --> 08:28.737
and I think it's cool
to sell drugs.

08:28.738 --> 08:30.806
Hold up... why does
the kid selling drugs

08:30.807 --> 08:31.940
sound like he's black?

08:31.974 --> 08:33.374
He's not.
Well, why not?

08:33.375 --> 08:36.410
Are you saying that
black people can't sell drugs?

08:36.445 --> 08:38.145
No, I'm not saying that.

08:38.179 --> 08:39.380
We have a black President.

08:39.381 --> 08:40.648
Why can't black people
sell drugs?

08:40.682 --> 08:42.683
I'm so confused.

08:42.684 --> 08:44.352
Black people can sell drugs!

08:44.353 --> 08:46.487
(All chanting)
Black people can sell drugs!

Black people
can sell drugs!

09:03.005 --> 09:05.840
Um... I'm building
this dollhouse for my girl.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.075
It's her birthday
tomorrow.

09:07.109 --> 09:08.643
I told my wife
I'd get it done.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.478
I had the same exact one
when I was a kid!

09:11.814 --> 09:14.316
Mom, Charles is hogging
my doll house!

09:14.317 --> 09:16.389
Grandma bought it
for the both of us!

09:16.555 --> 09:20.389
- You want some help, big man?
- No! I can do this.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.825
It's just driving me
a little crazy.

Where do I affix
the princess tower, Boyle?

09:25.361 --> 09:28.030
- Where do I affix it?
- On the side of the turret...

Not now, Boyle.

Let a brother breathe.

09:32.336 --> 09:34.971
Let a brother breathe.

09:35.005 --> 09:37.306
Why would I swap cases
with you?

09:37.341 --> 09:39.642
I got multiple calls that
a guy in the sackett towers

09:39.643 --> 09:41.577
is dealing meth
out of his apartment.

09:41.578 --> 09:42.878
It's a guaranteed arrest.

09:42.879 --> 09:45.013
And therefore will have
a ton of paperwork,

09:45.014 --> 09:46.849
which I know you hate.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.150
I have a murder here
with no leads

09:48.151 --> 09:49.318
and no evidence.

09:49.352 --> 09:52.221
It's unsolvable,
and thus...

09:52.222 --> 09:53.656
Shall have no paperwork.

09:53.690 --> 09:56.125
You had me
at "no paperwork."

09:56.160 --> 09:57.861
That was the very end
of the sentence.

09:57.895 --> 09:59.529
All right, Boyle.

09:59.530 --> 10:00.563
Let's hit it.

10:00.564 --> 10:01.998
So where are you going,
Peralta?

10:01.999 --> 10:04.200
I am on my way
to ending the slump.

10:04.201 --> 10:05.969
I got a dunker, Captain.
Nothin' but net.

10:06.003 --> 10:07.536
Hey, slump,
you're about to get

10:07.571 --> 10:09.171
nailed by the Jake hammer.

10:09.172 --> 10:10.892
So you haven't solved
any of your old cases,

10:10.907 --> 10:12.541
and yet you've
taken on a new one.

10:12.542 --> 10:13.909
I mean, shouldn't you
at least solve

10:13.910 --> 10:16.011
this Helen Sterrino missing
grandmother case first?

10:16.012 --> 10:17.513
Or I could solve
the super easy one,

10:17.514 --> 10:19.214
get my mojo back,
and move on to catching

10:19.215 --> 10:20.282
the zodiac killer.

10:20.283 --> 10:21.283
Am I getting ahead
of myself?

10:21.284 --> 10:22.451
No, you are not,
Jake rabbit.

10:22.452 --> 10:24.419
I like Jake hammer better.
Let's go. Ah.

10:27.190 --> 10:28.724
I did not think
getting these kids

10:28.725 --> 10:29.885
to sign up
would be this hard.

10:29.893 --> 10:32.027

don't wanna listen to you.

So are you!

10:35.431 --> 10:36.765
Why am I offended by that?

10:36.766 --> 10:38.133
They don't
identify with you

10:38.134 --> 10:39.734
because you're not
from the streets. I am.

10:39.735 --> 10:41.536
Follow, watch, learn.

10:43.306 --> 10:45.074
All right, listen up.

10:45.075 --> 10:46.409
I know you think
you're badasses.

10:46.443 --> 10:48.444
But deep down,
you're scared.

10:48.445 --> 10:49.946
How do I know?

10:49.947 --> 10:52.415
Because I've been
that same scared kid.

10:52.416 --> 10:54.484
And if you don't get
your crap together,

10:54.485 --> 10:57.120
I'm gonna end up busting you
and throwing you in jail.

laughing at you.

11:09.867 --> 11:12.735
That's never
happened before.

11:12.736 --> 11:15.133

I can see them.

but I'll hold it down.

11:24.848 --> 11:26.948
All right, flute man,
who else is in this apartment?

11:26.983 --> 11:28.550
Where's the dealer?
I live here alone

11:28.584 --> 11:29.784
with my birds.

11:29.785 --> 11:31.219
What, you don't think
I know this M.O.?

11:31.253 --> 11:32.453
These are mules.

11:32.454 --> 11:33.621
They're drug mules.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.323
They're bird mule drugs.

Drug bird mules.

11:36.425 --> 11:37.692
Apartment's clear.

11:37.693 --> 11:39.333
We got multiple calls
about a dealer here.

11:39.361 --> 11:41.630
I bet it's the silly kids
down the hall.

11:41.631 --> 11:43.432
They love prank calling me.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.100
The only drugs
in this apartment

11:45.101 --> 11:46.835
are for my heart,
my liver,

my kidney,
my salivary glands,

11:49.205 --> 11:50.672

on your shoulder.

11:54.687 --> 11:56.988
No, wait...
Pooped on your head,

11:56.989 --> 12:00.458
then dripped
onto your shoulder.

12:00.493 --> 12:02.694

it's good luck.</i>

12:02.728 --> 12:04.028
No, it isn't, okay?

12:04.029 --> 12:05.397
That's just something
people say

12:05.398 --> 12:07.365
when a bird poops on you
to make you feel better

12:07.366 --> 12:08.700
because it's terrible.

12:08.701 --> 12:10.835

12:10.870 --> 12:13.471
Oh, come on.

out of nowhere, confesses.

Well, he says he's gotta
make things right,

12:17.743 --> 12:20.278

his accomplices.

Hey, Jake.
You busy?

12:29.755 --> 12:32.223
Yes, I very clearly am busy.

12:32.258 --> 12:34.859
The medical examiner's office
just called.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.394
They mishandled
some evidence.

12:36.395 --> 12:39.564
So the D.A.'s gonna have
to dismiss your last two busts.

12:39.565 --> 12:40.732
[Sighs]
Great.

12:40.733 --> 12:42.367
And the slump gets worse.

12:42.368 --> 12:43.668
I don't think
it's a slump.

12:43.669 --> 12:45.804
Honestly, you are
straight-up cursed.

12:45.838 --> 12:47.372
Good to know.

12:57.883 --> 12:59.684
Can you hand me
a paper towel, please, Gina?

13:01.720 --> 13:03.121
There's no more left.

13:03.155 --> 13:04.155
Yeah, that sounds right.

13:06.891 --> 13:08.158

13:08.192 --> 13:10.927
You're dripping
on my carpet.

13:10.928 --> 13:13.396
Oh, don't worry, sir.
It's just urinal water.

13:13.397 --> 13:14.864
Clean urinal water.

13:14.865 --> 13:16.299
You could eat
off his shirt.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.001
Why would I ever
eat off his shirt?

13:18.002 --> 13:20.003
Look, sir, I don't know
what's going on,

13:20.004 --> 13:21.371
but I think I'm cursed.

13:21.372 --> 13:22.472
Cursed, huh?

13:22.473 --> 13:23.840
The freakiest things
have been happening to me.

13:23.841 --> 13:25.642
I mean, I can't solve a case
to save my life.

13:25.643 --> 13:27.444
Birds are unloading on me
left and right.

13:27.445 --> 13:28.912
And, two seconds ago...

13:28.946 --> 13:31.114
Hey, sarge, do we have
any old t-shirts in here? I...

13:36.690 --> 13:37.954
Cursed.

13:37.955 --> 13:40.290
Yeah, I've seen
this kind of thing before.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.192
It happened to a friend
of mine back in the 1-8.

13:42.226 --> 13:43.526
<i>Detective Smith.</i>

13:43.561 --> 13:44.794
We called him smitty.

13:44.795 --> 13:45.996
He thought he was cursed,

13:45.997 --> 13:48.298
and because cops
are superstitious,

13:48.299 --> 13:49.799
the whole precinct
thought he was cursed.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.334
But then he found a case,
and he solved it,

13:51.335 --> 13:52.602
and now he's married
to Kate Upton.

13:52.603 --> 13:54.537
<i>No. No one would go out
on calls with him.</i>

13:54.572 --> 13:57.040
He responded to a riot
at a gym without backup,

13:57.041 --> 13:58.842
and got beaten up
by a girls' volleyball team.

13:58.843 --> 14:01.478
It was actually
quite violent.

14:01.479 --> 14:02.545
<i>Man...</i>

14:02.546 --> 14:04.714
Girls are so scary.

14:04.715 --> 14:06.883

in the field again, Peralta.</i>

14:06.917 --> 14:07.984
I'm pulling you
from casework.

You can digitize old files
with Scully.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.487
You're benching me?

14:10.488 --> 14:12.322
No, no, no, look...
I've got a plan.

14:12.323 --> 14:14.224
Give all my open cases
to Hitchcock,

14:14.258 --> 14:15.291
who's suddenly
on a roll,

14:15.292 --> 14:16.393
and assign me
20 fresh ones.

14:16.394 --> 14:17.827
Eventually,
my luck will turn.

14:17.828 --> 14:18.995
No, I don't think
that's what's best for you

14:18.996 --> 14:20.063
or the squad.

14:20.064 --> 14:21.164
Not until this blows over.

14:21.165 --> 14:22.232
And how long
will that be?

14:22.233 --> 14:23.533
Could be a week,

14:23.534 --> 14:24.701
could be a month.

14:24.702 --> 14:26.803
Could be a year.
Could be a decade.

14:26.804 --> 14:30.540
Sorry, we're just saying
bigger and bigger numbers.

14:30.541 --> 14:32.509
I don't know how to connect
with these kids.

14:32.510 --> 14:35.545
They're mean and shallow
and respect nothing.

14:35.546 --> 14:37.547
I mean, what kind of person
would they even listen to?

14:37.548 --> 14:39.816
Hitchcock, stop bringing
your food

14:39.817 --> 14:41.151
in little
Tupperware containers.

14:41.152 --> 14:43.119
It hurts my fingers
when I'm trying to open it.

14:43.154 --> 14:44.220
<i>(Hitchcock)
Sorry!</i>

14:46.891 --> 14:49.859
Hey, Gina.
That's a super cute...

What do you want?

14:50.861 --> 14:52.629
Sweater.
Okay.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.230
Rosa and I think
it would be great

14:54.231 --> 14:55.732
if you talked to the kids.

14:55.733 --> 14:57.901
Mm, I thought
only cops could help.

14:57.902 --> 14:59.369
In this case,
not being a cop

14:59.370 --> 15:01.104
might actually be better.
Mm, that's true.

15:01.138 --> 15:03.940
In all cases,
cops are the worst.

15:06.310 --> 15:08.078
"Enter the numbers
from this report

15:08.079 --> 15:10.146
"into the corresponding boxes
on the screen.

15:10.147 --> 15:11.214
Then fill out these fields."

15:11.215 --> 15:12.716
And I'm in a coma.

No, don't touch it!

with smitty.

He says that you should
rub this rabbit's foot

15:30.568 --> 15:32.435
with your left forefinger
and your pinky,

15:32.436 --> 15:34.838
like this, for good luck.

15:34.839 --> 15:36.673
Okay? Now you try it.

15:36.674 --> 15:39.008
Okay.

15:39.009 --> 15:40.677
Yep.

15:40.678 --> 15:41.678
It's definitely helping.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.179
I can feel it.

15:43.180 --> 15:45.582
The curse is lifting
off of me.

I should be able
to put together

16:02.933 --> 16:04.434
a dollhouse in less
than four hours.

16:04.435 --> 16:07.737
Why does it have
to be so hard?

16:07.772 --> 16:11.674
Look... this screw
has three pointy sides.

16:11.675 --> 16:13.877
And nowhere to screw it in!

16:13.911 --> 16:15.478
[Screw clatters on floor]

16:15.513 --> 16:17.514
And there's wheels.

16:17.515 --> 16:20.583
What kind of castle
has wheels?

16:20.584 --> 16:22.685
[Screams]

16:22.686 --> 16:26.256
All right...
[Shouting]

16:26.290 --> 16:28.558
117a. Yes.

16:28.592 --> 16:29.993
117b.
Yes.

16:29.994 --> 16:31.261
118a.

16:33.364 --> 16:34.697
Wait a minute.

Roger that.

16:50.548 --> 16:52.081
Hey. What's going on?
Hey.

16:52.116 --> 16:53.817
Well, I'm not allowed
to leave my desk,

16:53.818 --> 16:54.851
so we have to meet
in here.

16:54.852 --> 16:56.352
So what you're saying
is that this

16:56.353 --> 16:58.788
is kind of a...
No, for the last time, Charles,

16:58.823 --> 16:59.989
we don't need
a clubhouse.

17:00.024 --> 17:02.025
Clubhouse!

17:02.059 --> 17:04.928
[High-pitched singsong]
Clubhouse.

17:04.962 --> 17:05.962
You know
what I'm thinking...

17:05.963 --> 17:07.763
No clubhouse.

17:07.798 --> 17:09.531
I need you to make
these calls for me.

17:09.532 --> 17:10.834
Don't let Holt see you.

17:10.835 --> 17:12.635
But if my hunch is right,
the slump is over.

17:12.670 --> 17:14.037
Come through for me,
Boyle.

17:14.038 --> 17:15.505
You know I will.
All right.

17:15.506 --> 17:17.240
I'm just saying, put a couple
leather chairs in here.

17:17.241 --> 17:18.407
Go!

17:21.354 --> 17:23.888
Children, your problem
is not that you're troubled

17:23.890 --> 17:27.025
or at-risk or bad dressers.

17:27.026 --> 17:28.794
Is that a trucker hat?
Still?

17:28.795 --> 17:30.996
<i>Come on.
Your problem...</i>

17:31.030 --> 17:34.232
Is that you don't
have passion for anything.

17:34.233 --> 17:38.270
My life turned around
when I found my passion.

17:38.304 --> 17:39.905
<i>And today,</i>

17:39.939 --> 17:43.508
well, I hope
to inspire you with it.

for everyone when I say

18:13.139 --> 18:15.440
your weird dancing
was just weird.

18:15.475 --> 18:19.111
Fine.
Cops make $52,000 a year.

18:19.112 --> 18:20.479
You never have to stop
at a red light.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.315
And you get to carry a gun.
Who wants in?

Boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom.

18:25.251 --> 18:26.752
<i>Yes.
Oh, my God.</i>

18:26.786 --> 18:28.620
You got eight kids
to sign up.

18:28.621 --> 18:29.755
How did you know
that would work?

18:29.789 --> 18:31.790
That's what made me sign up
when I was a kid.

18:31.791 --> 18:33.859
You did this program?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.293
It does not work.

18:38.531 --> 18:39.898
They're here.

18:39.932 --> 18:41.199
Fantastic.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.334
Too dramatic?

18:42.335 --> 18:43.402
No.
Hi.

18:43.403 --> 18:44.469
Why are we
in the bathroom?

18:44.504 --> 18:45.537
I thought you might
ask that,

18:45.538 --> 18:46.938
and I will answer
in due time.

18:46.939 --> 18:49.007
But first, I know
what happened to your grandma.

18:49.008 --> 18:50.008
Nothing.

18:50.042 --> 18:51.443
What are you
talking about?

18:51.444 --> 18:52.477
The reason
I couldn't find her

18:52.478 --> 18:53.812
is because
she never existed.

18:53.846 --> 18:55.914
<i>I had Detective Boyle
make some calls,</i>

18:55.948 --> 18:58.016

in five different states.

Recognize this?

What are you
accusing us of?

19:03.856 --> 19:04.923
Probably insurance fraud.

19:04.924 --> 19:06.358
Definitely filing
a false report

19:06.359 --> 19:07.659
and obstruction
of justice.

Now, you were wondering
why we did this in the bathroom.

19:09.996 --> 19:11.129
It's because
you're full of crap.

I see we got eight recruits
for the Junior police program.

19:18.304 --> 19:19.838
Outstanding.

19:19.872 --> 19:21.239
Thank you, sir.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.375
But, as important
as your praise is to me,

19:23.376 --> 19:24.976
it should
actually go to Gina.

19:24.977 --> 19:26.812
She's the one that
got through to the kids.

19:26.846 --> 19:28.346
Yes, I am amazing.

19:28.381 --> 19:31.183
And I only ask for one thing
in repayment.

19:31.184 --> 19:33.685
A 600% raise.
Or...

19:33.719 --> 19:34.820
I can give you
a zero percent raise

19:34.821 --> 19:36.888
and make you
my personal assistant,

19:36.923 --> 19:37.923
which is what I'm doing.

19:37.924 --> 19:39.458
I think you have
hidden talents,

19:39.492 --> 19:41.226
which will make you
surprisingly good the job.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.395
No, I have no talents.

19:43.429 --> 19:45.063
You start Monday.

19:45.064 --> 19:46.431
Ugh.

19:46.432 --> 19:49.067
Constantly getting
Holt's approval is the worst.

19:49.101 --> 19:51.636
Yes.
I can only imagine.

19:51.671 --> 19:54.639
Well, the curse is over.
The slump is done.

19:54.674 --> 19:55.874
Jake is back.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.242
Permission to take a selfie
of the two of us, sir?

19:57.243 --> 19:58.243
Permission denied.

19:58.244 --> 20:00.011
Too late.
[Camera snaps]

20:00.046 --> 20:01.847
Ah, that was a good one.

20:01.848 --> 20:03.815
So, the rabbit's foot
worked, huh?

20:03.850 --> 20:04.916
Ah, maybe.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.618
All I know is my mind
was so numb

20:06.619 --> 20:07.919
from doing
all that boring data entry

20:07.920 --> 20:09.254
that my brain
kind of rebooted,

20:09.255 --> 20:10.522
and I had an inspiration

20:10.556 --> 20:12.190
about one
of my old cases.

20:12.191 --> 20:13.492
[Deep breath]

20:13.493 --> 20:15.660
And I now see that
that was your plan all along.

20:15.661 --> 20:17.295
And that you're
capable of smiling.

20:17.330 --> 20:18.396
All talented detectives

20:18.397 --> 20:20.098
have their ups and downs,
Peralta.

20:20.132 --> 20:21.600
So you think I'm talented.

20:21.601 --> 20:22.934
You said it.
No takebacks.

20:22.935 --> 20:24.603
You know why Boyle
doesn't slump?

20:24.637 --> 20:26.338
Because his whole life
is a slump?

20:26.372 --> 20:27.706
Because he doesn't
let adversity get him down.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.774
<i>He keeps grinding.</i>

20:29.809 --> 20:31.710
If I'd given you
those new cases,

20:31.711 --> 20:33.979
the second you hit a snag,
you would have spiraled again.

20:33.980 --> 20:35.914
You need to stay out
of your own head.

20:35.915 --> 20:37.282
Okay. But, sir,
I don't get it.

20:37.283 --> 20:38.950
If that was your plan,
why bother with smitty

20:38.951 --> 20:40.118
and the rabbit's foot?

20:40.152 --> 20:41.319
Well, there's a very good
reason for that.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.956
I was, uh, I believe
the term is, uh...

20:44.957 --> 20:46.892
Messing with you.

20:46.926 --> 20:48.493
Oh...

20:48.494 --> 20:49.961

going on here.
