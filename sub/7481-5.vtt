00:13.128 --> 00:14.327
Hello?

00:14.329 --> 00:15.729
Sam, Frank Turner.

00:15.731 --> 00:18.330
If you're hearing this,
it means it's all gone to hell.

00:18.332 --> 00:21.196
A lot of people think I'm crazy.
How'd you get this number?

00:21.198 --> 00:22.841
I guess I might be,

00:22.843 --> 00:24.809
a little.

00:24.811 --> 00:27.408
But please try and see this
through my eyes.

00:27.410 --> 00:29.344
No one else can seem to.

00:29.346 --> 00:31.514
I need your help.

00:31.516 --> 00:32.950
You know where I am.

02:25.727 --> 02:37.867
♪

02:47.655 --> 02:49.288
It's me.

02:56.864 --> 02:58.565
I'm sorry.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.367
It's not like that.

03:00.369 --> 03:01.935
Didn't know him that well.

03:01.937 --> 03:04.739
We did a joint task force
together eight years ago.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.340
Haven't seen him since.

03:06.342 --> 03:08.042
Why'd he call you?

03:08.044 --> 03:10.111
That's the million-
dollar question.

03:11.715 --> 03:14.315
He's got a dog?
Big-ass poodle.

03:14.317 --> 03:16.618
Doesn't make any sense.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.187
It's in the bathroom.
You're not a poodle guy?

03:19.189 --> 03:22.023
Why breed a dog with an Afro?

03:22.025 --> 03:23.325
I think you're just jealous.

03:23.327 --> 03:25.561
No ladder.

03:25.563 --> 03:29.498
Well, he could have
climbed up over here,

03:29.500 --> 03:32.034
stood on top,
swung the rope

03:32.036 --> 03:33.803
over the beam.
Turner wasn't

03:33.805 --> 03:35.071
the most athletic guy.

03:35.073 --> 03:37.474
He was brilliant,
but a little nutty.

03:37.476 --> 03:38.708
He wasn't a CIA field agent?

03:38.710 --> 03:42.179
No, he was more
of a reader, researcher.

03:42.181 --> 03:45.315
He had a lot of crazy theories.
I heard the CIA tossed him.

03:54.459 --> 03:56.427
They always like
baseball,

03:56.429 --> 03:58.529
don't they?

03:58.531 --> 04:00.298
The geniuses at the Agency?

04:00.300 --> 04:04.001
Those stats and numbers...
they obsess over it.

04:04.003 --> 04:05.469
Turner was always

04:05.471 --> 04:07.672
doing crossword
puzzles...

04:07.674 --> 04:09.240
word games.

04:09.242 --> 04:12.309
Hello?
We're in here.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.379
See, it's 'cause
of stuff like that

04:15.381 --> 04:16.714
I don't leave OPS.

04:16.716 --> 04:19.183
Spiderman will
protect you.

04:19.185 --> 04:21.422
Those pajamas come with feet?

04:21.423 --> 04:23.257
I cut the feet off.
Come on.

04:23.259 --> 04:25.493
I don't wear footy pajamas.

04:25.495 --> 04:27.828
They don't come in my size.

04:27.830 --> 04:30.964
Did you forget your gear?

04:33.134 --> 04:35.469
The transformer for this part
of the grid was intentionally

04:35.471 --> 04:36.937
overloaded when
someone circumvented

04:36.939 --> 04:39.440
the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power's firewall.

04:39.442 --> 04:41.710
I saw a security camera
down at the entrance.

04:41.712 --> 04:43.745
Yeah, there are three
covering the building

04:43.747 --> 04:45.213
and eight traffic
cameras outside.

04:45.215 --> 04:47.482
Unfortunately, they all went
out when the power went out.

04:47.484 --> 04:50.484
Taking out the power is a
great way to cover your tracks.

04:50.486 --> 04:51.852
LADWP's computer system

04:51.854 --> 04:55.489
is designed to stop
a cyber-terrorist attack.

04:55.491 --> 04:58.693
Whoever did this
has got mad skills.

04:58.695 --> 05:00.595
If someone wanted
to make it look like a suicide,

05:00.597 --> 05:01.629
why blow the door?

05:01.631 --> 05:04.432
Nothing's adding up.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.468
Start looking at street cams
just outside the area

05:06.470 --> 05:08.069
where the transformer blew.

05:10.439 --> 05:12.474
Hey.

05:12.476 --> 05:14.510
Hello.

05:14.512 --> 05:15.977
Um, you look...

05:15.979 --> 05:17.446
Sleepy.

05:17.448 --> 05:18.614
He was gonna say "beautiful."

05:18.616 --> 05:19.782
Oh.

05:19.784 --> 05:21.817
Okay, well, um...

05:21.819 --> 05:24.820
the recorded call you received,
it came from a message service.

05:24.822 --> 05:26.289
It was a fail-safe.

05:26.291 --> 05:27.790
So if Turner didn't
manually cancel

05:27.792 --> 05:29.559
the automated message
every night...

05:29.561 --> 05:32.128
It called me.

05:33.797 --> 05:36.398
This where
the party's at? Ooh.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.966
This
does not look

05:37.968 --> 05:39.902
- like a party.
- Yikes.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.571
We know him?

05:42.573 --> 05:43.872
Kind of.

05:45.409 --> 05:47.910
He's got a dog?

05:47.912 --> 05:50.546
Oh, poor little guy.
His master is dead.

05:50.548 --> 05:53.849
He's stuck in a bathroom.

05:53.851 --> 05:55.451
Oh.

05:55.453 --> 05:56.586
A poodle? No.

05:56.588 --> 05:57.687
Sorry, I don't do poodles.

05:57.689 --> 05:58.721
Huge attitude,

05:58.723 --> 06:00.056
un-trainable.
- Actually, they are

06:00.058 --> 06:01.724
one of the three
most intelligent breeds of dog.

06:01.726 --> 06:03.125
Well, I will
have you know

06:03.127 --> 06:06.028
that Monty is
brilliant and humble.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.096
Monty eats sponges.

06:07.098 --> 06:09.366
- This is true.
- Turner was a high-level

06:09.368 --> 06:10.500
CIA agent.

06:10.502 --> 06:12.336
He was trained
to live inconspicuously.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.871
There's no way he'd
have a dog like that.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.709
Find out where the dog came
from and why Turner had it.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.244
Me and the...

06:19.246 --> 06:20.846
Poodle.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.484
Nell's got the photos.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.421
Let's see if the dog's been
listed as stolen or missing.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.591
Hmm... think I'm gonna
have to go spend some time

06:32.593 --> 06:34.326
with him, alone.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.560
Why?

06:35.562 --> 06:37.163
What's going on?

06:37.165 --> 06:38.997
Nothing. I just got
a way with animals.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.300
Okay, when you say it like that,
it sounds really creepy.

06:41.302 --> 06:42.873
What, you never heard
of the dog whisperer?

06:42.874 --> 06:44.641
Just because you have Monty doesn't mean
you're the dog whisp...

06:44.666 --> 06:45.338
Ssst!

06:45.339 --> 06:47.206
Oh.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.540
Ssst! Ssst!
Don't you dare do that to...

06:48.542 --> 06:50.476
Sit!
Hey!

06:50.478 --> 06:52.344
Listen, canines
are very sensitive

06:52.346 --> 06:53.879
to all this negative energy.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.347
Yeah? They can
also smell fear.

06:55.349 --> 06:57.616
That's true.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.919
Poodles are
the pit bull of France.

06:59.921 --> 07:03.255
God, my partner is Dr. Dolittle.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.559
How we doing, boy?

07:07.595 --> 07:08.961
All right.

07:08.963 --> 07:10.296
That didn't sound
like whispering.

07:10.298 --> 07:11.731
That sounds like growling.

07:11.733 --> 07:15.301
He is angry and confused,
and you are <i>not</i> helping.

07:15.303 --> 07:18.605
You're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

07:19.608 --> 07:21.374
What's that?

07:21.376 --> 07:22.709
She doesn't understand you?

07:22.711 --> 07:24.644
Yeah, well,
she's my partner.

07:24.646 --> 07:25.778
Welcome to <i>my</i> world.

07:25.780 --> 07:28.314
Yeah, that's true.

07:28.316 --> 07:30.483
Yeah, she is very
high-maintenance.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.887
That's fine.
You want to play like that?

07:34.889 --> 07:36.889
That's fine.
We'll go to plan B.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.458
Kensi? Gonna
need some bacon.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.393
Oh, really? That's your
special skill with dogs?

07:41.395 --> 07:43.328
- Bacon?
- I need it cooked.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.330
Very well done,
preferably organic.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.832
All right.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.335
I know a shelter that's
offering free neutering.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.272
Oh, what?

07:53.274 --> 07:54.940
Yeah, that's what I thought.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.883
I hate paper.

08:03.885 --> 08:06.586
You sure he didn't have
a computer I could search?

08:06.588 --> 08:09.088
Turner was strictly
a hard-copy information guy.

08:09.090 --> 08:11.191
Turner may have left the Agency,

08:11.193 --> 08:13.526
but he was definitely still
gathering intelligence.

08:13.528 --> 08:16.362
There's information here
on al-Qaeda, North Korea.

08:17.298 --> 08:19.832
Hey. I did a scan

08:19.834 --> 08:21.501
of the building's
security cameras' hard drives

08:21.503 --> 08:23.102
from before the blackout...

08:23.104 --> 08:27.441
Just for the record, I was gonna
say that-that you look nice.

08:27.443 --> 08:29.109
Oh.

08:29.111 --> 08:31.812
Well... thank you.

08:31.814 --> 08:34.248
So, I went back...

08:34.250 --> 08:35.849
I was distracted, because...

08:35.851 --> 08:37.818
I was wondering why
you were so dressed up

08:37.820 --> 08:39.253
at 4:00 in the morning.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.225
Okay, well,
perhaps I had a date.

08:44.227 --> 08:45.893
Makes sense.

08:45.895 --> 08:48.964
But then I noticed your, uh,
your pronounced bed-head,

08:48.966 --> 08:50.732
which means that
you were asleep.

08:50.734 --> 08:52.134
But if-if you
were home, then,

08:52.136 --> 08:54.136
um, you would have changed
before you came into work,

08:54.138 --> 08:55.939
which means that you

08:55.941 --> 08:58.675
were asleep but <i>not</i> at home,

08:58.677 --> 09:00.710
which means...
It's none of your business.

09:00.712 --> 09:02.045
What did you find out?

09:02.047 --> 09:04.080
I looked at the cameras going
back two weeks, and I saw

09:04.082 --> 09:06.716
that Turner had a guest
that came over three times.

09:06.718 --> 09:09.786
I got her license plate
from one of the outside cameras,

09:09.788 --> 09:11.554
and I tracked it from the DMV

09:11.556 --> 09:12.722
to this TAS security record.

09:12.724 --> 09:15.091
Megan Hendley, flight attendant?

09:15.093 --> 09:17.494
Let's see what she knows.

09:17.496 --> 09:19.962
So, that's what happened.
Mrs. Allen came in with, uh,

09:19.964 --> 09:22.632
her miniature chocolate
poodle named Coco Chanel,

09:22.634 --> 09:25.902
who you probably would have
thought was super hot.

09:25.904 --> 09:28.271
The point being
that I reached across

09:28.273 --> 09:31.441
to try to pet Coco Chanel,
and that's when she bit me,

09:31.443 --> 09:35.111
hence the two bite marks
I had right there and why...

09:35.113 --> 09:36.980
- I'm afraid of poodles.
- Are you

09:36.982 --> 09:39.650
having a therapy session
with a dog?

09:39.652 --> 09:41.752
It took a while, but
he finally broke down,

09:41.754 --> 09:43.888
spilled his guts.

09:43.890 --> 09:46.357
It's actually kind
of a sad story.

09:46.359 --> 09:47.725
What did he have to say?

09:47.727 --> 09:49.460
He said his name was Chaucer.

09:49.462 --> 09:51.562
Ain't that right, Chaucer?
Come here.

09:51.564 --> 09:53.498
Good boy.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.833
Okay,

09:54.835 --> 09:56.535
nobody names
their dog Chaucer.

09:56.537 --> 09:58.003
He's just
smelling the bacon.

09:58.005 --> 09:59.704
Bacon was for me.

09:59.706 --> 10:01.406
His vet...

10:01.408 --> 10:02.941
is Dr. Hall
on Robertson Boulevard.

10:02.943 --> 10:06.111
His previous owner was
Jason Young from Tarzana.

10:06.113 --> 10:08.013
Did Nell find out
the dog was missing?

10:08.015 --> 10:12.117
No. Why are you doubting me?

10:12.119 --> 10:15.087
Wow, you must
really want the bacon.

10:16.456 --> 10:18.657
He's microchipped.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.158
You scanned him
and got the information.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.160
What? Don't hate on me.
I'm the one that

10:22.162 --> 10:24.329
knew to look between
his shoulder blades.

10:25.899 --> 10:30.736
And that is all of my bacon
you're getting.

10:30.738 --> 10:33.705
Send the information to Nell.

10:51.592 --> 10:53.560
Just got home.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.666
Megan Hendley?

10:59.668 --> 11:01.134
Federal agents!

11:01.136 --> 11:02.735
Back alley!

11:25.559 --> 11:26.592
Federal agents.

11:26.594 --> 11:28.461
Drop it or you're dead.

11:34.935 --> 11:37.270
Something tells me you're not
really a flight attendant.

11:46.538 --> 11:47.838
Got it.

11:50.541 --> 11:53.110
Hetty got confirmation--
she is CIA.

11:56.081 --> 11:57.381
You were working
with Turner?

11:58.483 --> 12:00.718
Frank hasn't worked for
the Company in two years.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.888
You were in his loft three times
in the last two weeks.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.824
We were
romantically involved.

12:07.693 --> 12:08.659
No more?

12:08.661 --> 12:10.961
He's dead.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.464
Makes it kind of hard.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.599
And you know this how?

12:15.601 --> 12:19.003
An official call to
the L.A. Coroner's Office.

12:20.472 --> 12:21.505
You often call the morgue

12:21.507 --> 12:23.307
to find out
if your friends are dead?

12:23.309 --> 12:24.908
Frank called yesterday.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.844
Left a message.

12:26.846 --> 12:30.681
Said he was in a lot of trouble.

12:30.683 --> 12:34.384
He didn't think
he'd be alive much longer.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.919
He say why?
No.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.121
But he thought I could be
in danger, too.

12:39.524 --> 12:42.159
That explains
the warm reception.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.161
Last couple days, he thought
he was being surveilled.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.295
I thought he was paranoid.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.764
Why?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.465
Frank was brilliant
but he was...

12:48.467 --> 12:54.138
obsessive, difficult,
opinionated, depressed.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.706
And you loved him?

12:55.708 --> 12:58.342
Sometimes you can't choose

12:58.344 --> 13:00.344
who you fall in love with,
Agent Hanna.

13:05.550 --> 13:06.583
What was he working on?

13:06.585 --> 13:09.219
You ever heard of
the Sinclair Project?

13:09.221 --> 13:12.655
The Sinclair Project began
at the end of the Cold War,

13:12.657 --> 13:15.124
when Reagan and Gorbachev
met in Reykjavik.

13:15.126 --> 13:18.194
It's rumored they discussed
the mutual disclosure

13:18.196 --> 13:21.764
of long-term sleeper agents
inside both countries.

13:21.766 --> 13:22.799
Armed with small nuclear bombs.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.367
I always thought
that was an urban myth.

13:24.369 --> 13:25.635
Not for Frank--
he thought the Soviets

13:25.637 --> 13:27.670
had them in the U.S.
since the late '60s.

13:27.672 --> 13:29.472
And if a war broke out...

13:29.474 --> 13:31.340
We'd each have a gun
to each other's head.

13:31.342 --> 13:33.443
So the Sinclair Project
was the mission

13:33.445 --> 13:35.011
to find the sleeper agents
in the U.S.

13:35.013 --> 13:36.312
and collect their weapons?

13:37.448 --> 13:39.749
The Agency thought
Frank was a nut.

13:39.751 --> 13:42.986
They didn't even want to hear
what he'd uncovered.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.688
You think he killed himself?

13:44.690 --> 13:45.955
No way.

13:45.957 --> 13:50.393
Frank was too angry
to kill himself.

13:50.395 --> 13:52.862
He had too much to prove.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.138
Any chance that has
something to do

14:01.140 --> 14:02.874
with the task force
you worked with Turner?

14:02.876 --> 14:05.676
Eight years ago?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.612
We had good intel
that an al-Qaeda cell

14:07.614 --> 14:09.147
was trying to acquire
automatic rifles

14:09.149 --> 14:10.281
from a Russian arms deal.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.116
Something spooked 'em.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.651
Deal didn't go down.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.186
Everybody disappeared.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.253
Task force was disbanded.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.554
Well, if they're
not related,

14:17.556 --> 14:20.257
why did Turner have the
fail-safe set up to call you?

14:24.764 --> 14:26.030
Go.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.165
We're just
finishing up over here.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.299
Few things we need you
to look at.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.333
Okay.

14:29.335 --> 14:30.535
One thing's a little odd.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.904
Medical examiner's
got something.

14:41.313 --> 14:44.648
The fractured cervical spine,
the rope abrasions,

14:44.650 --> 14:47.017
the lividity of the blood
trapped in his head,

14:47.019 --> 14:49.920
are all consistent with
self-inflicted hanging.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.455
Could somebody else
have hanged him?

14:51.457 --> 14:54.659
They could have, but I didn't find any
indications of a struggle.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.494
That's not the headline, though.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.962
Put your gloves on.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.234
I found this in his stomach.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.137
What is it?

15:05.139 --> 15:07.372
Well, there's a yogic practice--
Vastra Dhauti.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.244
It's the swallowing of a strip
of cloth to cleanse the stomach.

15:17.552 --> 15:18.986
This is not that.

15:19.787 --> 15:21.588
We need to sign this out.

15:25.226 --> 15:28.227
Something shaped like
a pipe or a tube.

15:28.229 --> 15:29.261
How big we talking?

15:29.263 --> 15:30.329
I don't know.

15:30.331 --> 15:31.763
The size is
the key to the cipher.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.231
If you don't know the
circumference of the tube,

15:33.233 --> 15:34.232
you can't duplicate it.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.700
What are you guys
looking for?

15:38.003 --> 15:39.837
That.

15:41.506 --> 15:42.606
It's more conical.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.342
It'd be a better key
for the code, right?

15:45.344 --> 15:47.478
Harder to duplicate.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.946
Hold this.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.180
Whoa, this is the code?

15:50.182 --> 15:51.982
Cool!
Where'd you get it?

15:51.984 --> 15:54.084
Turner's stomach.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.720
I think it's a coded
message called <i>scytale.</i>

15:55.722 --> 15:57.354
The Spartans used it
to send secret messages

15:57.356 --> 15:58.922
during battle.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.792
And Turner expected you to know
about a code like that?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.961
Turner knew I studied
warrior cultures.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.398
He knew it'd be the one code
that Sam would recognize.

16:15.172 --> 16:17.740
This is a message for me.

16:27.965 --> 16:31.167
Our friend Chaucer
has lead a big life.

16:31.169 --> 16:34.337
He's descended from a long line
of award-winning poodles.

16:34.339 --> 16:35.972
Chaucer was flown
to Paris twice...

16:35.974 --> 16:37.941
to breed.

16:37.943 --> 16:39.542
He was paid to have
sex in Paris?

16:39.544 --> 16:41.243
I should have been
born a dog.

16:44.047 --> 16:45.947
I walked into
that one, didn't I?

16:45.949 --> 16:47.615
Turner bought the dog
just a month ago,

16:47.617 --> 16:49.084
and immediately entered him into

16:49.086 --> 16:50.752
the Southland Kennel Club
Dog Show,

16:50.754 --> 16:53.455
so I cross-referenced
the list of names

16:53.457 --> 16:54.756
Eric found in Turner's documents

16:54.758 --> 16:57.959
with the dog show's judges
and contestants,

16:57.961 --> 17:01.162
Robert Pierce.

17:01.164 --> 17:03.065
He named his dog Uma?

17:03.067 --> 17:05.934
Maybe Turner was using Chaucer
to get close to this Robert Pierce.

17:05.935 --> 17:08.270
He's a dog groomer
and breeder

17:08.271 --> 17:10.973
who's lived in Los Angeles
his entire life.

17:10.974 --> 17:12.808
He's got no military
and no criminal record.

17:12.810 --> 17:13.942
You know what this guy is?

17:13.944 --> 17:15.143
Yeah. Boring.

17:15.145 --> 17:16.278
Why was Turner
looking into him?

17:16.280 --> 17:18.012
Why would he name his dog Uma?

17:18.015 --> 17:20.214
Hey, Eric, do we
have anything else

17:20.217 --> 17:22.351
on a Robert Pierce?

17:22.353 --> 17:23.819
Nothing yet. Still looking.

17:23.820 --> 17:25.220
So Turner entered Chaucer

17:25.222 --> 17:27.455
in the dog show soon after
he bought him.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.724
Pierce is one of
the contestants.

17:29.726 --> 17:32.060
Well, Turner didn't just stop
being a CIA agent,

17:32.062 --> 17:33.695
and suddenly get into
fancy dogs.

17:33.697 --> 17:35.129
Turner was looking at Pierce.

17:36.231 --> 17:37.465
When is the show?

17:37.467 --> 17:39.801
It's tomorrow morning at
the L.A. Sports Arena.

17:39.803 --> 17:41.068
Get to the show.

17:41.070 --> 17:43.738
Get close to this guy and
see what you can find out.

17:44.906 --> 17:47.774
I know for a fact that Chaucer
is mortified by that haircut.

17:47.776 --> 17:50.844
Deeks, you do not have the
ability to talk to dogs.

17:50.846 --> 17:53.448
Hey, trust me-- there is no species
in the entire universe

17:53.450 --> 17:56.818
where it is cool to have
pom-poms shaved into your butt.

17:56.820 --> 17:58.987
Speaking of haircuts, you're
gonna need a little sprucing up

17:58.989 --> 18:00.188
if you're going to be
seen with Chaucer.

18:00.190 --> 18:01.256
Whoa, no.

18:01.258 --> 18:03.258
Wait a minute-- okay--
I may have developed

18:03.260 --> 18:05.360
a little bit of a special
relationship with this dog,

18:05.362 --> 18:07.862
but there is no way that I am
prancing around the ring

18:07.864 --> 18:09.197
with that animal.

18:09.199 --> 18:11.032
Detective Deeks.

18:14.071 --> 18:17.139
I think there's much for you
to learn from Mr. Chaucer.

18:17.141 --> 18:20.643
He's a very complex
and spiritual animal.

18:20.645 --> 18:22.379
It's not Mr. Chaucer,
it's just Chaucer.

18:22.381 --> 18:24.681
Which actually makes me want
to throw up a little bit

18:24.683 --> 18:25.916
every time I say it.

18:25.918 --> 18:27.384
Chaucer is very loyal.

18:28.888 --> 18:31.522
He will have your back
undercover.

18:31.524 --> 18:33.891
Oh.
You were listening again?

18:37.095 --> 18:38.963
Yeah.

18:38.965 --> 18:40.898
Stand tall with your
partner, Detective Deeks.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.900
All right.

18:42.902 --> 18:45.836
Chaucer, let's go.

18:45.838 --> 18:47.238
Good boy.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.640
And listen, if you're going
to walk next to me, no prancing.

18:49.642 --> 18:51.776
I don't want the Dobermans
laughing at us.

18:53.379 --> 18:56.014
Guys, Turner encoded the code.

18:56.016 --> 18:58.016
It's a simple cipher.
Of course.

18:58.018 --> 19:00.819
It's the old secret spy ring,
from when we were kids.

19:02.155 --> 19:04.056
Come on, the spy ring,
when we were kids--

19:04.058 --> 19:05.757
you turn it
and the letters line up?

19:05.759 --> 19:06.992
I love that ring.

19:06.994 --> 19:08.260
It was my first
piece of spy gear.

19:08.262 --> 19:09.962
I don't think I've ever
seen him this excited.

19:09.964 --> 19:11.029
It's a cool ring.

19:11.031 --> 19:13.732
I know what I'm getting
you for Christmas.

19:13.734 --> 19:15.634
All it is, is substituting
one letter for another.

19:15.636 --> 19:16.569
Exactly.

19:16.571 --> 19:17.736
Letters on the top
of the alphabet,

19:17.738 --> 19:19.705
letters on the bottom,
are the key.

19:19.707 --> 19:21.407
Both the receiver and the sender
need the key.

19:21.409 --> 19:23.109
So the A's become R's.

19:23.111 --> 19:24.143
Right.

19:24.145 --> 19:26.612
But Turner took
the encrypted message,

19:26.614 --> 19:29.115
used the new key,
and encoded it again.

19:29.117 --> 19:31.684
So he probably changed the
cipher pattern slightly,

19:31.686 --> 19:32.852
each time he did it.

19:32.854 --> 19:34.120
If there is multiple keys,

19:34.122 --> 19:36.189
you're going to need all of them
to unlock the message.

19:36.191 --> 19:37.791
But if he encoded it
with a computer,

19:37.793 --> 19:38.792
it could be millions.

19:38.794 --> 19:40.694
He didn't use a code.

19:40.696 --> 19:41.929
The message was for me,

19:41.931 --> 19:44.399
so the key had to be something
he knew I could find.

19:44.401 --> 19:46.234
It's somewhere here.

19:46.236 --> 19:49.504
There's hundreds of thousands
of documents in this room.

19:50.906 --> 19:52.239
Then let's get to work.

19:52.241 --> 19:54.142
- Here go you.
- Thank you.

19:54.144 --> 19:56.177
Open miniature,
jumpers with weaves,

19:56.179 --> 19:58.379
fast, ring two, five minutes.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.721
Everybody's making their dogs
look like Dr. Seuss animals.

20:06.723 --> 20:08.255
There is our grooming station.

20:08.257 --> 20:09.690
Up.
Come on.

20:09.692 --> 20:11.425
...ring three
for the obedience competition.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.560
Good Chaucer.
Good boy.

20:12.562 --> 20:14.729
Hey, uh, give me your hairbrush.

20:14.731 --> 20:16.297
For Chaucer? No.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.599
I need a hairbrush, all right?

20:17.601 --> 20:18.733
His fro is a mess.

20:18.735 --> 20:21.803
Oh, my gosh.

20:23.272 --> 20:24.672
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do with this.

20:24.674 --> 20:26.574
It's like
a rat's nest.

20:26.576 --> 20:27.875
There's Robert Pierce.

20:27.877 --> 20:29.310
Huh? Oh.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.577
And there is Uma.

20:30.579 --> 20:32.546
Not as pretty as her picture.

20:32.548 --> 20:34.382
Probably airbrushed.

20:34.384 --> 20:35.483
Oh, he's checking
us out.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.718
Hi.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.753
Open standard,
jumpers with weaves,

20:38.755 --> 20:41.123
fast, ring two, five minutes.
Come on, girl.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.692
All right, that's us.
Let's get ready.

20:42.694 --> 20:43.860
All right,
you go talk to Pierce;

20:43.862 --> 20:44.861
I'm going to give Chaucer
a pep talk.

20:44.863 --> 20:47.096
Mm.
What?

20:47.098 --> 20:49.465
The better that we do,
the easier it's going to be

20:49.467 --> 20:50.933
for you to get close
to Pierce.

20:52.369 --> 20:53.903
Okay, that makes sense.

20:53.905 --> 20:55.671
I was getting a little disturbed
by my partner

20:55.673 --> 20:57.239
talking to a dog.

20:57.241 --> 20:58.374
You really want to do this?

20:58.376 --> 20:59.542
You want to have a fight
right in front of him,

20:59.544 --> 21:01.110
before the biggest
moment of his life?

21:01.878 --> 21:03.479
Ittleay, elfishay,
ensikay.

21:03.481 --> 21:05.581
Okay, the dog doesn't
understand English.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.216
Why are you speaking
in Pig Latin?

21:07.218 --> 21:08.484
Because you're adorable
when you get angry.

21:08.486 --> 21:10.052
Deeks... ah...
Ssst!

21:10.054 --> 21:11.087
See? You're stunning.

21:13.623 --> 21:15.224
Hey, psst!

21:15.226 --> 21:16.325
What are we doing?

21:16.327 --> 21:17.793
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:17.795 --> 21:19.595
the moment you've
been waiting for,

21:19.597 --> 21:21.564
open standard.

21:24.035 --> 21:25.968
Okay, over! Chute!

21:28.205 --> 21:30.707
Over! Double! Double!

21:32.109 --> 21:33.977
Over!

21:35.380 --> 21:37.581
Target! Tunnel!

21:37.583 --> 21:40.285
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip!

21:43.756 --> 21:45.291
And over!

21:45.992 --> 21:49.128
Teeter, teeter,
teeter, teeter!

21:49.130 --> 21:50.296
Slam! Weave!

21:50.298 --> 21:51.430
Weave!

21:51.432 --> 21:53.132
Good girl! Weave!

21:53.134 --> 21:55.100
Over!

21:57.671 --> 22:00.239
That was a great run by Uma,

22:00.241 --> 22:01.507
trained by Robert Pierce.

22:01.509 --> 22:03.409
Okay, all right, boy.

22:03.411 --> 22:04.910
We got to do this.

22:04.912 --> 22:05.945
It's our job,

22:05.947 --> 22:07.780
and I have no idea
what I'm doing,

22:07.782 --> 22:08.915
so I need your help.

22:08.917 --> 22:10.817
Now, Chaucer,

22:10.819 --> 22:12.018
trained by Frank Turner.

22:12.020 --> 22:13.720
Okay, you ready?
Game face.

22:13.722 --> 22:15.121
All right, let's do it.
Here we go.

22:15.123 --> 22:16.456
Come on, come on.

22:18.525 --> 22:19.792
Ho, sit.

22:19.794 --> 22:21.728
Sit.

22:21.730 --> 22:22.862
Good boy.

22:22.864 --> 22:23.930
That's a good Chaucer.

22:23.932 --> 22:24.998
That was amazing.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.432
Thank you.

22:26.434 --> 22:27.466
I'm Rebecca Turner.

22:27.468 --> 22:28.735
Chaucer is my dog.

22:28.737 --> 22:31.071
Oh, great dog.

22:31.073 --> 22:32.772
Nice height, good lines.

22:32.774 --> 22:34.508
Thank you.

22:36.544 --> 22:38.845
All right, and go.

22:38.847 --> 22:40.447
And begin.

22:40.449 --> 22:41.848
All right.

22:43.084 --> 22:44.785
Uh, you can go now.

22:44.787 --> 22:46.053
Can we please?

22:46.055 --> 22:47.288
All right, yeah.

22:47.290 --> 22:49.056
This is our first show.

22:49.058 --> 22:51.025
If you're doing this to get back
at me for all the poodle jokes,

22:51.027 --> 22:52.727
the only person
you're hurting is yourself.

22:52.729 --> 22:54.728
Come on, Chaucer.

22:54.730 --> 22:56.730
Chaucer, I need you
to help me right now.

22:56.732 --> 22:57.798
Can you please just start.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.699
Chaucer, here we go.

22:58.701 --> 23:01.034
Over, through!

23:01.036 --> 23:02.569
Go over, tunnel.

23:02.571 --> 23:04.071
Yeah, come on, come on.

23:04.073 --> 23:05.405
Up! Sorry.

23:05.407 --> 23:07.340
Climb. Mark...

23:07.342 --> 23:09.742
Mark. Up.

23:09.744 --> 23:11.344
Tunnel. Come on.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.812
Yeah. Over.

23:12.814 --> 23:14.680
Easy, easy, easy.

23:14.682 --> 23:16.882
Easy. Over.

23:16.884 --> 23:19.017
Mark. Easy.

23:19.019 --> 23:20.418
Easy. Good boy.

23:20.420 --> 23:22.353
Come on, through. Weave.

23:22.355 --> 23:23.921
Weave, weave.
Oh, you're doing great.

23:23.923 --> 23:25.890
You're doing great.
Weave, weave,

23:25.892 --> 23:27.291
weave... Over.

23:33.097 --> 23:36.700
And that was Chaucer,

23:36.702 --> 23:38.135
trained by Frank Turner.

23:38.137 --> 23:41.205
53 seconds!
Hey, would you be interested

23:41.207 --> 23:43.807
in breeding Uma and Chaucer?

23:45.610 --> 23:48.578
I'm not really interested
in breeding right now.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.946
Sorry.

23:49.948 --> 23:52.649
It looks like a clean run
Oh.

23:52.651 --> 23:54.350
after a slow start
with no faults.

23:55.585 --> 23:56.852
Oh, you did a great job.

23:56.854 --> 23:58.688
You're an amazing dog,
and if you ever want

23:58.690 --> 24:00.923
to get into bomb-
sniffing, you call me.

24:02.759 --> 24:04.894
Good boy.

24:04.896 --> 24:06.296
So, uh,

24:06.298 --> 24:08.030
we got a love connection?
No.

24:08.032 --> 24:08.931
He spooked.

24:10.402 --> 24:11.701
Come on, come on.

24:13.304 --> 24:14.370
He's gone.

24:14.372 --> 24:15.471
Parking lot.

24:15.473 --> 24:17.073
Good girl, Uma.

24:17.075 --> 24:18.841
Hi.

24:18.843 --> 24:20.376
Hi, sorry, we really
wanted to, uh,

24:20.378 --> 24:21.577
to breed with you.

24:21.579 --> 24:23.479
Sorry, that sounded a lot
creepier than I meant it

24:23.481 --> 24:25.314
to sound, I just meant that, uh...

24:25.316 --> 24:26.782
I have to go.

24:26.784 --> 24:28.751
All right.

24:30.487 --> 24:31.786
Federal agents.

24:31.788 --> 24:32.987
Get out of the car.

24:32.989 --> 24:34.355
Get out!

24:34.357 --> 24:37.692
Hands up against the car.

24:37.694 --> 24:40.127
Just FYI,

24:40.129 --> 24:43.597
Chaucer would never fall
for somebody as tawdry as Uma.

24:43.599 --> 24:46.067
What the hell is going on?
Why are you following me?

24:58.132 --> 24:59.533
Come on, poodles.

24:59.535 --> 25:02.402
Nothing out of you two.

25:02.404 --> 25:03.904
Up.

25:03.906 --> 25:05.906
Up. Sit.

25:05.908 --> 25:08.209
And no inappropriate licking.

25:11.246 --> 25:15.050
For starters, a stud doesn't ask
to breed with a bitch.

25:15.052 --> 25:16.818
It is the other way around.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.221
I hope you're listening
to this.

25:19.223 --> 25:21.958
That doesn't explain
why you ran.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.328
I was in a bad relationship.

25:25.330 --> 25:28.998
My ex-boyfriend was stalking me.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.734
I hired a detective who told me

25:31.736 --> 25:34.204
there was a man watching
my house.

25:34.206 --> 25:36.974
Not your boyfriend?
No.

25:36.976 --> 25:40.911
This is the picture
the detective got.

25:42.313 --> 25:44.181
What is going on here?

25:44.183 --> 25:45.983
Do you guys work
for him?

25:45.985 --> 25:48.619
Pierce did file
several complaints with the LAPD

25:48.621 --> 25:51.422
against an ex-boyfriend.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.358
It's Turner.

25:55.161 --> 25:56.862
Turner was looking
into old sleeper agents

25:56.864 --> 25:58.063
with nuclear weapons.

25:58.065 --> 25:59.264
Why was he after Robert?

25:59.266 --> 26:00.765
This guy couldn't
have been involved

26:00.767 --> 26:01.833
with the Sinclair Project.

26:01.835 --> 26:03.034
He's too young.

26:03.036 --> 26:04.302
Hey, I found this.

26:04.304 --> 26:07.940
It says, "Both parents black?"
Question mark.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.241
I didn't know
what to make of it,

26:09.243 --> 26:10.342
but then I saw that Pierce

26:10.344 --> 26:11.711
was African-American.

26:11.713 --> 26:14.179
Turner was trying to
find Robert's parents.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.782
If one of them was white,
they might be Russian.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.984
Deeks, ask him
about his parents.

26:18.986 --> 26:21.120
Are your parents still alive?

26:21.122 --> 26:23.322
Yes. They live in the Valley.

26:23.324 --> 26:24.991
Get the address.
I want to talk to them.

26:24.993 --> 26:26.860
He'll give up the address.

26:26.862 --> 26:29.863
He doesn't know anything
about this.

26:33.835 --> 26:36.036
Low profile.

26:43.279 --> 26:45.913
Who is it?

26:45.915 --> 26:47.815
Federal agents.

26:47.817 --> 26:49.516
Just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.887
About what?

26:54.889 --> 26:57.489
About your son.

26:59.493 --> 27:02.261
She was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's

27:02.263 --> 27:03.963
two years ago.

27:03.965 --> 27:05.664
It's a horrible disease.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.466
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

27:07.468 --> 27:09.068
Is my son okay?

27:09.070 --> 27:10.736
He's fine.

27:10.738 --> 27:13.705
Well, he's a good man.

27:13.707 --> 27:17.609
Takes good care
of his mom and I.

27:17.611 --> 27:18.877
Is that why

27:18.879 --> 27:21.179
he pays the rent,
collects the mail?

27:21.181 --> 27:22.180
Yeah, yeah.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.548
He does everything that he can

27:23.550 --> 27:25.350
so that I can take care
of my bride.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.219
Do you have any idea

27:27.221 --> 27:30.056
why a CIA agent might
want to find you?

27:30.058 --> 27:32.025
The CIA?

27:32.027 --> 27:34.260
No.

27:34.262 --> 27:35.595
What is this about?

27:35.597 --> 27:38.199
Just trying to connect the dots.

27:38.201 --> 27:40.034
Nothing for you to worry about.

27:40.036 --> 27:41.769
You have enough to handle.

27:43.705 --> 27:47.075
You think this guy's
a Russian sleeper agent?

27:47.077 --> 27:48.743
Turner must have thought so.

27:48.745 --> 27:50.344
Why else was he
investigating him?

27:50.346 --> 27:52.146
I don't know yet.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.447
Maybe Turner was crazy.

27:53.449 --> 27:55.049
His girlfriend
called him paranoid.

27:55.051 --> 27:56.217
Would you call me paranoid?

27:56.219 --> 27:57.518
Sometimes.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.053
Sometimes I need to be.

27:59.055 --> 28:01.055
Somebody blew that door open.
Tell you the truth,

28:01.057 --> 28:02.256
I'm feeling a little paranoid
right now.

28:02.258 --> 28:04.325
Did you catch the guys
in the car back there?

28:07.062 --> 28:08.228
I got them.

28:08.230 --> 28:10.397
I'll pull around the corner.

28:24.813 --> 28:26.781
That's not good.

29:21.569 --> 29:23.670
We need to talk.

29:26.941 --> 29:28.675
Three heavily armed men come
to your house,

29:28.677 --> 29:29.976
and you don't know why?

29:29.978 --> 29:31.944
I don't know what else
you want me to say.

29:31.946 --> 29:33.612
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

29:33.614 --> 29:36.014
West Valley Gun and Ammo.

29:36.016 --> 29:37.682
I heard the shots.

29:37.684 --> 29:39.350
I grabbed my gun, I ran outside.

29:39.352 --> 29:40.852
I thought I was helping.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.822
I'm just not buying it, James.

29:45.624 --> 29:47.425
You know who those guys were.

29:47.427 --> 29:49.260
You know why they were there.
I'm telling you,

29:49.262 --> 29:51.262
I don't know who...
I don't know who they were.

29:52.531 --> 29:55.566
Maybe they were there
because of you.

29:57.402 --> 29:58.670
Where are my wife and son?

29:58.672 --> 30:00.005
They're in a safe location.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.139
Well, my wife,

30:01.141 --> 30:03.208
she has medications
she needs to take

30:03.210 --> 30:04.375
at specific times.

30:04.377 --> 30:06.077
She has a nurse with her.

30:06.079 --> 30:07.679
She has her meds.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.855
Are you a Soviet agent?

30:19.792 --> 30:23.295
Do I look like
a Soviet agent to you?

30:27.733 --> 30:31.069
I finally found a car
heading out of the blackout zone

30:31.071 --> 30:33.071
near Turner's loft,
and I got a name.

30:36.542 --> 30:38.176
The car was moving fast

30:38.178 --> 30:39.611
at roughly Turner's time
of death.

30:39.613 --> 30:43.148
I, uh, traced the license
to a man named Kozlov.

30:43.150 --> 30:44.182
Know this guy?

30:44.184 --> 30:46.118
This is what the CIA has on him.

30:46.120 --> 30:49.622
Russian, former federal
security service agent.

30:49.624 --> 30:51.224
He could still be FSB.

30:51.226 --> 30:53.793
So whatever Turner
was investigating,

30:53.795 --> 30:55.628
it made Russian
Intelligence nervous enough

30:55.630 --> 30:56.996
to go after him.

30:56.998 --> 30:59.866
Blow up the photo
in the upper left full screen.

30:59.868 --> 31:03.737
I want to see the guy
Kozlov's talking to.

31:03.739 --> 31:06.306
According to the CIA,
his name is Isaac...

31:06.308 --> 31:08.575
Sidorov.

31:11.245 --> 31:12.912
Sidorov is the arms dealer

31:12.914 --> 31:15.348
that the task force
was monitoring

31:15.350 --> 31:17.651
when I was working with Turner.

31:17.653 --> 31:22.288
Well, that at least explains
why Turner contacted you.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.490
Sidorov worked in Putin's
network the first go-around

31:24.492 --> 31:26.859
and is a former FSB agent.

31:26.861 --> 31:28.294
He's an arms dealer now.

31:28.296 --> 31:30.596
Several agents tried
to go undercover

31:30.598 --> 31:32.131
inside his network.

31:32.133 --> 31:34.801
Most never got close.

31:34.803 --> 31:36.769
But one did?

31:36.771 --> 31:39.672
Yeah.

31:41.308 --> 31:43.175
We have a major problem here.

31:43.177 --> 31:46.444
If Frank Turner was looking
into old sleeper agents...

31:46.446 --> 31:47.612
And FSB found out about it

31:47.614 --> 31:49.314
and asked Sidorov
to investigate Turner...

31:49.316 --> 31:51.650
That means
the Sinclair Project...

31:51.652 --> 31:52.551
Is real.

31:52.553 --> 31:53.652
Exactly.

31:53.654 --> 31:55.320
Soviet agents are here now,

31:55.322 --> 31:57.656
armed with nuclear weapons?

31:57.658 --> 32:01.759
The NSA and the CIA are already
tracking our investigation.

32:01.761 --> 32:05.196
That means their interest
is most definitely real.

32:05.198 --> 32:07.165
All of this explains

32:07.167 --> 32:09.834
why the Russians killed Turner,
but why go after James?

32:09.836 --> 32:12.636
FSB is never wrong.

32:14.606 --> 32:17.007
You and your wife
are living in a way

32:17.009 --> 32:18.408
so you couldn't
be easily found.

32:18.410 --> 32:19.810
Why?

32:19.812 --> 32:21.545
My son was
taking care of us.

32:21.547 --> 32:25.015
A CIA agent was tracking
your son to get to you

32:25.017 --> 32:26.149
and you don't know why?

32:26.151 --> 32:28.184
Why don't you ask the agent?

32:28.186 --> 32:29.586
He's dead.

32:29.588 --> 32:31.321
I'm sorry.

32:31.323 --> 32:33.023
But I don't know
what to tell you.

32:33.025 --> 32:34.325
I really don't.

32:34.327 --> 32:35.492
Okay.

32:35.494 --> 32:36.827
Your wife and son

32:36.829 --> 32:37.995
are getting sent
back to your house,

32:37.997 --> 32:39.830
but you're not
getting released.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.699
Well, what if those men
come back?

32:41.701 --> 32:43.401
Why would they come back?
I don't know.

32:43.403 --> 32:44.769
Who were they, James?

32:48.039 --> 32:50.875
My wife and my son

32:50.877 --> 32:53.244
are all that I have
in this world.

32:53.246 --> 32:55.712
Please don't do this.

32:55.714 --> 32:57.915
Okay.

33:00.818 --> 33:02.419
Yeah.

33:02.421 --> 33:03.987
Cut 'em loose.

33:03.989 --> 33:06.289
Send 'em back
to the house.

33:06.291 --> 33:07.723
Are you... wait, wait, wait.

33:07.725 --> 33:09.759
Okay, wait.
Hold on.

33:14.964 --> 33:16.832
They need to be kept
in a safe place.

33:16.834 --> 33:19.567
You need to protect my wife
from prosecution.

33:19.569 --> 33:21.836
I'll call you back.

33:21.838 --> 33:24.573
We can guarantee
their safety.

33:24.575 --> 33:26.342
But we won't
give them immunity.

33:26.344 --> 33:27.943
If your wife is involved...

33:27.945 --> 33:29.879
Then you get nothing from me.

33:29.881 --> 33:32.816
She might as well die tonight

33:32.818 --> 33:34.485
than rot in a jail.

33:34.487 --> 33:36.687
Grant the immunity.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.060
Okay.

33:42.062 --> 33:45.496
Your wife will be granted
full immunity from prosecution.

33:45.498 --> 33:49.133
Safety and care, guaranteed.

33:49.135 --> 33:50.435
Yes.

33:57.143 --> 33:59.343
Who were those men, James?

34:04.282 --> 34:06.784
Do you know what it's like

34:06.786 --> 34:09.120
to live with a secret

34:09.121 --> 34:12.157
your entire life, Agent Hanna?

34:17.630 --> 34:19.931
I'm sure it's not easy.

34:21.801 --> 34:24.703
Where do I start?

34:30.576 --> 34:33.844
There is a light in here,
somewhere.

34:49.929 --> 34:53.197
From what I understand,
this generates

34:53.199 --> 34:55.400
a 17-kiloton explosion.

34:58.004 --> 34:59.871
That's bigger than Hiroshima.

35:01.588 --> 35:02.630
Can you imagine

35:02.631 --> 35:06.899
the burden of carrying
this secret, Agent Hanna?

35:23.758 --> 35:24.991
Let me ask you a question.

35:25.993 --> 35:28.928
What would make you
betray your country?

35:28.930 --> 35:31.196
Money?

35:32.032 --> 35:34.901
You think I'm American.

35:34.903 --> 35:37.203
I was born in Somalia.

35:37.205 --> 35:40.640
In 1961, during the coup,

35:40.642 --> 35:42.275
the Russians came
to our country.

35:42.277 --> 35:45.612
They took Donna and I
back to USSR.

35:45.614 --> 35:47.748
Why you?

35:47.750 --> 35:51.251
We had excelled
in our language class.

35:51.253 --> 35:54.821
We spoke English.

35:54.823 --> 35:59.660
They force-fed us Soviet
doctrine, day and night.

36:00.495 --> 36:02.429
We were nine years old.

36:02.431 --> 36:06.600
In 1973, as husband and wife,

36:06.602 --> 36:10.738
we were taken
on a Soviet submarine

36:10.740 --> 36:13.540
to a fishing boat off
the shore of Seattle.

36:13.542 --> 36:15.342
I had a passport,

36:15.344 --> 36:18.279
an identity, a profession.

36:18.281 --> 36:21.148
You escaped detection
because the Soviets knew

36:21.150 --> 36:24.118
Americans would never think
a Russian agent would be black.

36:26.222 --> 36:29.190
Would you have detonated that
bomb if the order came in?

36:29.192 --> 36:31.426
Yes.

36:34.096 --> 36:37.031
At first.

36:37.033 --> 36:40.602
They had conditioned
me to do it.

36:40.604 --> 36:43.805
But then...

36:43.807 --> 36:47.242
after a few years...

36:47.244 --> 36:51.646
I had a wife... and a son.

36:53.516 --> 36:55.784
I could never do that.

37:11.700 --> 37:15.436
Love, family...

37:15.438 --> 37:16.704
turned out to be

37:16.706 --> 37:21.009
much stronger persuaders
than fear, Agent Hanna.

37:28.383 --> 37:31.686
FBI's Render Safe unit's
15 minutes out.

37:31.688 --> 37:33.854
They'll remove the bomb.

37:36.458 --> 37:39.927
So FSB asked Siderov
to look into Turner because...

37:39.929 --> 37:41.562
Because Turner was right.

37:41.564 --> 37:43.898
There are more agents here.

37:43.900 --> 37:45.533
Then what was the next step?

37:45.535 --> 37:47.035
Get the agents
out of the country,

37:47.037 --> 37:48.403
or kill them to cover up.

37:48.405 --> 37:49.671
That's what FSB would do.

37:49.673 --> 37:52.440
Siderov had no allegiance
to Russian Intelligence.

37:52.442 --> 37:53.808
He's a for-profit
arms dealer.

37:53.810 --> 37:55.810
He couldn't give a damn
about old Soviet agents.

37:55.812 --> 37:56.978
You just said it.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.147
He's an arms dealer.

37:59.849 --> 38:02.217
He wanted the bomb.
To sell.

38:02.219 --> 38:04.987
It'd be the mother
of all weapons deals.

38:04.989 --> 38:08.657
Siderov knew Turner was tracking
the other Soviet sleeper agents.

38:08.659 --> 38:10.525
He gets Turner, he gets
the names of the agents.

38:10.527 --> 38:12.493
Siderov knew there
were more bombs.

38:12.495 --> 38:14.629
That's what was
in Turner's stomach.

38:14.631 --> 38:16.965
It was a list of
the sleeper agents.

38:16.967 --> 38:21.169
Turner needed me to find it
before Siderov.

38:25.707 --> 38:27.675
Anything?

38:27.677 --> 38:29.877
Without the code keys,
it might be impossible.

38:29.879 --> 38:30.978
All right, let's start
at the beginning.

38:30.980 --> 38:32.580
What happened the night
Turner was killed?

38:32.582 --> 38:35.316
He knew Siderov and
the FSB were onto him.

38:37.419 --> 38:38.686
Turner was prepared for that.

38:38.688 --> 38:40.855
He coded the names.

38:40.857 --> 38:42.890
Had them ready.

38:42.892 --> 38:45.426
Power goes out...

38:45.428 --> 38:47.528
Maybe he saw them
out the window.

38:47.530 --> 38:48.963
He knew they were
coming for him.

38:48.965 --> 38:50.765
He had only minutes.
But he was ready.

38:50.767 --> 38:52.367
He swallowed the list of names.

38:52.369 --> 38:54.904
But he still had
the names in his head.

38:55.772 --> 38:57.406
He knew he'd be tortured.

38:57.408 --> 38:59.475
He did kill himself.

38:59.477 --> 39:01.510
He called the fire department

39:01.512 --> 39:04.079
so that Siderov wouldn't
have time to search the loft.

39:04.081 --> 39:06.048
He did everything he could.

39:06.050 --> 39:08.250
No one would listen.

39:08.252 --> 39:09.885
And he still died
for his country.

39:09.887 --> 39:12.454
That's why you
were his fail-safe.

39:12.456 --> 39:14.657
He knew you wouldn't
write him off.

39:17.571 --> 39:19.706
He said, "See through my eyes".

39:21.475 --> 39:23.977
"See through my eyes..."

39:28.850 --> 39:30.717
What if he meant it literally?

39:49.103 --> 39:50.804
It's the decoder ring.

39:50.806 --> 39:53.073
The piles of books are
arranged in a circle.

39:56.210 --> 39:58.778
All the books on top
have bookmarks.

39:58.780 --> 40:00.046
Count how many there are.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.783
The first letter's underlined.

40:03.785 --> 40:07.086
Two, four, six, eight,

40:07.088 --> 40:09.522
ten, 12, 14, 16, 18...

40:10.357 --> 40:11.424
Twenty-six.

40:11.426 --> 40:13.026
Just like the alphabet.

40:13.028 --> 40:16.262
Wait, so it's the first
letter in each book.

40:18.598 --> 40:20.766
Read me the letters.

40:21.935 --> 40:22.968
"N."

40:22.970 --> 40:25.036
"U."

40:25.038 --> 40:26.938
"K."

40:28.041 --> 40:29.608
- "H."
- "R".

40:29.610 --> 40:31.810
"W."
"A."

40:31.812 --> 40:33.378
"B."

40:33.380 --> 40:35.013
"F."

40:35.015 --> 40:36.448
"G." Ironic.

40:36.450 --> 40:38.516
"C."
"E."

40:38.518 --> 40:40.051
"I."
"P."

40:40.053 --> 40:41.653
"J."
"D."

40:41.655 --> 40:43.154
"V."
"Q."

40:43.156 --> 40:44.422
- "O."
- "S."

40:44.424 --> 40:46.224
- "Y."
- "M."

40:46.226 --> 40:47.592
"T."
"X."

40:47.594 --> 40:49.727
That's it.
Okay.

40:51.630 --> 40:53.031
The first part is decoded.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.399
Okay, he-he's telling us

40:55.401 --> 40:57.168
he changed the cipher
for the next round.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.804
It's two letters represent one.

40:59.806 --> 41:01.005
Means every other letter

41:01.007 --> 41:03.240
in the code is blank, a-a dummy.

41:03.242 --> 41:04.375
Start over.

41:04.377 --> 41:06.611
We use the second letter
in each book.

41:07.012 --> 41:07.912
"X."

41:07.914 --> 41:10.148
"Z."

41:10.150 --> 41:11.716
"P."

41:11.718 --> 41:12.650
"I."

41:12.652 --> 41:13.752
"F."
"W."

41:13.754 --> 41:15.254
- "S."
- "G."

41:15.256 --> 41:17.056
"O."
"U."

41:17.058 --> 41:18.457
"Z."

41:18.459 --> 41:19.792
"A."

41:19.794 --> 41:21.427
Okay.

41:26.668 --> 41:29.236
We got it.

41:29.238 --> 41:31.639
It's the list of names.

41:31.641 --> 41:33.074
There's James Pierce's name.

41:33.076 --> 41:35.643
It's the list of sleeper agents.

41:41.317 --> 41:43.551
Oh, just so you know,

41:43.553 --> 41:45.853
last night I, uh,
I went out drinking...

41:45.855 --> 41:47.989
It's none of my business.
...with Hetty.

41:47.991 --> 41:48.956
Oh.

41:48.958 --> 41:50.691
I wanted you to know.

41:50.693 --> 41:52.226
Naturally, she drank me

41:52.228 --> 41:55.129
under the table, so I had
to stay at her house...

41:55.131 --> 41:56.263
Sounds fun.

41:56.265 --> 41:57.431
I wish I was there.

41:57.433 --> 41:58.866
Mm.

41:58.868 --> 42:00.467
Uh, it took a while,

42:00.469 --> 42:01.802
but we think these are them.

42:01.804 --> 42:03.103
How do you know?

42:03.105 --> 42:05.205
Well, some of them
had gaps in their history.

42:05.207 --> 42:07.307
A birth record but no
elementary school record.

42:07.309 --> 42:11.512
Two are husband and wife,
so that made it easy,

42:11.514 --> 42:13.080
but with this one,

42:13.082 --> 42:14.882
the facial structure
of the adult photo

42:14.884 --> 42:16.183
didn't match
the childhood photo.

42:16.185 --> 42:17.885
Where are these agents located?

42:17.887 --> 42:19.319
All over.

42:19.321 --> 42:22.188
Houston, Philadelphia,
Detroit...

42:22.190 --> 42:25.024
Eight largest cities
in the country.

42:25.026 --> 42:26.259
Not exactly.

42:26.261 --> 42:28.027
Not now.

42:28.029 --> 42:29.094
Those are the eight
largest cities

42:29.096 --> 42:30.262
back in the '70s and the '80s,

42:30.264 --> 42:31.731
when they were put undercover.

42:31.733 --> 42:33.198
Each one of those

42:33.200 --> 42:34.566
could have a nuclear bomb.

42:35.569 --> 42:36.835
And what makes them
really valuable

42:36.837 --> 42:38.203
is that they're already
inside our borders.

42:38.205 --> 42:39.604
So anybody that buys them...

42:39.606 --> 42:41.239
...is gonna use them here.

42:43.276 --> 42:46.711
Nell, get me the National
Security Division of the FBI.

42:46.713 --> 42:48.079
Who would you like to speak to?

42:50.283 --> 42:53.095
<i>Anyone who'll pick up</i>
<i>the phone. Quickly.</i>
