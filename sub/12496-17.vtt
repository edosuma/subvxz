- You tell me!

00:54.500 --> 00:56.500
I took a nap, right here,

this bottle of glue

was in my hand,

09:00.417 --> 09:02.250
He got hit by a bus.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.250
I went to his funeral.

09:04.291 --> 09:08.750
- Well, did you see

09:04.291 --> 09:08.750
him at the funeral?

09:08.792 --> 09:10.208
- Yes, it was an open casket.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.750
I walked right up

09:10.250 --> 09:11.750
and I looked inside.

09:11.792 --> 09:12.542
- Hmm, what'd you see?

09:12.583 --> 09:13.291
- Nothing.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.125
- Aha!

09:15.166 --> 09:17.375
- Well, he's invisible!

09:17.417 --> 09:19.750
- Well, I say that maybe...

09:19.792 --> 09:21.458
Invisible Brad is not dead.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.542
- All right...

09:26.458 --> 09:27.834
- What are you gonna do?

09:27.875 --> 09:30.333
- We're going to

09:27.875 --> 09:30.333
the Swellview Semedery.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.250
- Cemetery.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.166
- Ah, both pronunciations

09:33.291 --> 09:35.166
are acceptable.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.750
- Nah, I don't think they are.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.750
- Well, I think you're wrong.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.709
- White Shadow

White Shadow

09:39.750 --> 09:43.166

09:43.208 --> 09:46.125

09:43.208 --> 09:46.125

09:46.166 --> 09:47.250
- Hang on, Jasper.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.875
Sweet Kumquat's busy.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.750
- Let's go, Kid.

10:00.792 --> 10:02.208
- Wait! Catch...

10:02.250 --> 10:04.458

10:02.250 --> 10:04.458
No. No. Charlotte,

10:04.500 --> 10:05.625
you keep the walkie--

10:05.667 --> 10:07.208
- Up the tubes!

10:07.250 --> 10:09.625
- No, I don't wanna

10:07.250 --> 10:09.625
take the walkie--

10:19.875 --> 10:24.667
- Wow. Look at those stars.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.500
You ever look up

10:24.709 --> 10:26.500
at the stars and think,

10:26.542 --> 10:31.208
"Hey stars, I'm better

10:26.542 --> 10:31.208
than you."

10:33.208 --> 10:37.500
- Okay, I'm finished.

10:37.542 --> 10:39.542
- Oh, you done digging?

10:39.583 --> 10:42.041
- Yeah, I done digging...

10:42.083 --> 10:43.792
all by myself,

10:43.834 --> 10:46.333
while you laid there

10:43.834 --> 10:46.333
lookin' at the stars

10:46.375 --> 10:50.250
and stuffing your face

10:46.375 --> 10:50.250
with fruit-grapes.

10:50.291 --> 10:53.250
- Who calls 'em "fruit-grapes?"

10:50.291 --> 10:53.250
- I do.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.250
- Well it's weird.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.250
- Okay whatever.

10:55.291 --> 10:58.125
The deal was, I dig the dirt--

10:55.291 --> 10:58.125
you lift Brad's casket

10:58.166 --> 10:59.709
outta the hole.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.041
- All right.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.333
- Move.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.792
- Oh man, you brought

11:07.375 --> 11:09.792
the anti-grav?

11:09.834 --> 11:11.542
- Yeah.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.083
- Wha- Wait, wait, wait.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.083
So, I just spent two hours

11:14.125 --> 11:16.625
diggin' a six-foot-deep hole!

11:16.667 --> 11:19.208
And now all you gotta do

11:16.667 --> 11:19.208
is lift the casket

11:19.250 --> 11:22.917
with the anti-grav,

11:19.250 --> 11:22.917
which takes no effort?

11:22.959 --> 11:25.250
- Yeah.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.792
You ready?

11:29.834 --> 11:32.458
- I guess.

11:41.166 --> 11:44.875
- You should feel inside.

11:44.917 --> 11:47.959
- You feel inside.

11:44.917 --> 11:47.959
- Okay-okay.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.041
First one to say "not it"

11:48.000 --> 11:50.041
doesn't have to feel inside so--

11:50.083 --> 11:53.208
- Not it.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.208
- Dang it!

11:53.250 --> 11:56.333
- Okay, we'll both feel inside.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.083
- 'Kay.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.083
- Okay.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.458
- Lookin' for me? Haha.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.125
- Ahhhh!

12:01.500 --> 12:04.125
- Ahhh!

12:05.792 --> 12:06.709

12:19.500 --> 12:21.125
And now...

12:21.166 --> 12:24.625
I'll just lift up the casket.

12:26.375 --> 12:29.291
And down you boys go.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.458
- Let us go!

12:32.417 --> 12:34.625
- Help!

12:37.250 --> 12:40.667
Have a nice night you two.

12:40.709 --> 12:43.500
Hope you're comfy in there.

12:44.542 --> 12:46.375
- I think Charlotte was right.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.250
Invisible Brad is alive.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.417
- Here. Here.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.417
A little bit on there...

12:51.458 --> 12:55.458
- What was your first clue?

13:03.667 --> 13:05.750
- Just a little bit more.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.792
One more scoop.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.583
Oh, that's pretty.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.875
See ya, super-suckers!

13:11.917 --> 13:13.750
- Wait Brad!

13:11.917 --> 13:13.750
- Come Back!

13:13.792 --> 13:15.667
You come back here!

13:15.709 --> 13:16.709
I mean it!

13:16.750 --> 13:18.667
Don't you eat my grapes!

13:18.709 --> 13:21.375
- Bye!

13:28.083 --> 13:29.250
- At least now we can see.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.875
- What are you doin'?

13:31.500 --> 13:33.875
- Tryin' to get my phone.

13:33.917 --> 13:35.583
- Oh yeah. I'll get mine.

13:33.917 --> 13:35.583
- Okay.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.208
Wait, just hold on.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.208
Will you stop moving so much?

13:38.250 --> 13:39.917
- I said it first.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.917
Let me get mine first!

13:39.959 --> 13:41.834
- I have seniority.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.834
- What are you talking about?

13:41.875 --> 13:44.834
We're in a coffin.

13:41.875 --> 13:44.834
- I have to Twit this!

13:47.375 --> 13:48.458
- Okay...

13:50.625 --> 13:52.750
and no signal.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.250
How 'bout you?

13:54.291 --> 13:58.375
- Mine's dead, I forgot

13:54.291 --> 13:58.375
to charge it last night.

13:58.417 --> 13:59.792
- So, now we're trapped,

13:59.834 --> 14:01.166
of Swellview Cemetery,

"Here lies Bradley Belcher".

15:26.500 --> 15:31.041
- Hey! Did this come

15:26.500 --> 15:31.041
from the DMV?

15:31.083 --> 15:33.125
- Yeah.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.125
- And the DMV

15:33.166 --> 15:35.750
is a government agency,

15:33.166 --> 15:35.750
right?

15:35.792 --> 15:37.417
- I... I guess.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.583
- And the government

15:37.458 --> 15:40.583
doesn't make "mistakes"...

15:40.625 --> 15:43.417
does it?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.500
We can't let Piper

18:53.000 --> 18:54.500
and Jasper see us

18:54.542 --> 18:55.834
as Captain Man and Kid Danger!

18:55.875 --> 18:57.125
- Ah geez!

18:57.166 --> 18:59.250
Uh, quick, our gum balls!

19:11.959 --> 19:14.667
- Okay, get ready

19:11.959 --> 19:14.667
to be rescued.

19:18.166 --> 19:21.709
- Errgghh... There!

19:21.750 --> 19:23.250
It's open.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.000
- Aw man, thanks buddy.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.792
- Yeah, thank you, Jasper.

19:32.834 --> 19:36.291
Prancing Pony and I couldn't

19:32.834 --> 19:36.291
have done it without you.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.667
- No problem.

19:37.709 --> 19:40.375
- So, how did

19:37.709 --> 19:40.375
you and your boss

19:40.417 --> 19:44.417
get trapped here

19:40.417 --> 19:44.417
and buried in a casket?

19:44.458 --> 19:46.250
- Well, uhh...

19:44.458 --> 19:46.250
- Uh...

19:46.291 --> 19:48.667
- It's-it's a...

19:46.291 --> 19:48.667
it's a weird story...

19:48.709 --> 19:49.959
- Yeah. That's uh...

19:48.709 --> 19:49.959
- Yeah...

19:50.000 --> 19:51.583
- Well actually,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.583
we were watching--

19:51.625 --> 19:53.542
we were at Junk-N-Stuff--

19:51.625 --> 19:53.542
- We were watching TV...

19:53.583 --> 19:56.083
- Right, and there was

19:53.583 --> 19:56.083
a news report on...turtles!

19:56.125 --> 19:58.583
- Turtles! Right!

19:56.125 --> 19:58.583
- Uh, here at the semedery...

19:58.625 --> 20:00.792
- It's cemetery but whatever.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.792
Okay. You know what?

20:00.834 --> 20:02.792
We'll figure that out later.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.792
And then after we got here,

20:02.834 --> 20:05.125
I'm like, "Oh no!

20:02.834 --> 20:05.125
I gotta go get a haircut"

20:05.166 --> 20:06.500
And he's crazy so we actually,

20:06.542 --> 20:08.458
we went and got

20:06.542 --> 20:08.458
a haircut after that.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.792
And while I was getting

20:08.500 --> 20:10.792
a haircut I had something spill

20:10.834 --> 20:12.834
on my pants...

20:15.208 --> 20:17.834
- C'mon, I'll drive you home.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.250
- Ohhh noo.

20:23.917 --> 20:26.166
- But we thought you walked

20:23.917 --> 20:26.166
in front of a bus

20:26.208 --> 20:28.875
and got all... y'know, dead.

20:28.917 --> 20:30.083
You thought wrong.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.750
- That's what Ray told us.

20:31.792 --> 20:34.500
- Yeah, I wanted him

20:31.792 --> 20:34.500
to think I was dead.

20:34.542 --> 20:37.250
So that later, I could

20:34.542 --> 20:37.250
sneak back into his life

20:37.291 --> 20:38.917
and take over as

20:37.291 --> 20:38.917
the new super-hero,

20:38.959 --> 20:41.041
here in Swellview.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.834
Haha! So now, I'm--

20:42.875 --> 20:45.250

20:42.875 --> 20:45.250
- Wait, who's that?

20:45.291 --> 20:47.125
- Who texted?

20:45.291 --> 20:47.125
- Henry!

20:47.166 --> 20:49.417
He says he and Ray'll be back

20:47.166 --> 20:49.417
here in just a minute!

20:49.458 --> 20:51.250
- Oh man!

20:54.375 --> 20:59.125
- What... what are you

20:54.375 --> 20:59.125
doin' there, Brad?

20:59.166 --> 21:02.750
- Taking off the uniform,

20:59.166 --> 21:02.750
so Ray won't be able to see me!

21:09.917 --> 21:10.667
- Where's Brad?

21:10.709 --> 21:12.959
- He left!

21:13.041 --> 21:15.291
- No, he's right there!

21:16.959 --> 21:18.250
- The pants, the pants!

21:18.291 --> 21:19.417
- Get the pants!

21:21.542 --> 21:24.333
- Leave me alone Ray! You're

21:21.542 --> 21:24.333

21:36.375 --> 21:38.083
- Ray! There he is!

21:36.375 --> 21:38.083
- Oh! Oh! Right there!

21:38.125 --> 21:40.625
- Henry, uh, use the bear spray!

21:40.667 --> 21:41.583
- Right! Right! Right! Right!

21:41.625 --> 21:42.542
- Come on Ray be cool.

21:42.583 --> 21:43.750
Not the bear spray.

21:43.792 --> 21:44.917
I was just kidding arou--

21:44.959 --> 21:46.458
Ahhh! Help me!

21:46.500 --> 21:48.291
It burns! Ahhh!

21:48.333 --> 21:49.750
Ahhh!

21:53.625 --> 21:54.792
That burns so bad!

21:54.834 --> 21:56.333
- That's not something

21:54.834 --> 21:56.333
you see every day.

21:56.375 --> 21:57.667
- No. Kinda weird, huh?

21:57.709 --> 21:59.291
- It's a little unusual, Ray...

21:57.709 --> 21:59.291
a little unusual.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.166
- Ahhh! How do the bears

21:59.333 --> 22:01.166
deal with this?

22:01.208 --> 22:02.542
Oh my God it's horrible.
