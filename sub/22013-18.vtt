00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.420
-Previously on Empire...
-Welcome back, Eddie.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.588
ANDRE:
He's gonna convince

00:20.621 --> 00:22.323
the board members
to sell Empire to Kelly Patel.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.059
We'll buy Empire back
from the shareholders.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.694
I'm going $700 million.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.562
BLAKE: That photo
is not what you think.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.498
...my son Blake's head
with so much stuff,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.066
he don't know
he's white anymore.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.767
And I ain't seen or heard
from this dude

00:33.801 --> 00:35.203
in 15 years!

00:35.236 --> 00:36.337
I need a favor, all right?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.538
Can y'all just hop
onstage with me?

00:37.571 --> 00:39.573
You guys can go ahead,
but I'm out.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.708
This is your scarf.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.344
You were wearing it the night
that you killed Shine.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.278
(gunshots)

00:44.312 --> 00:46.080
EDDIE:
Either you withdraw your bid

00:46.114 --> 00:49.650
for Empire, or you spend
the rest of your life in prison.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.756
After all these years, Eddie,

00:55.789 --> 00:57.391
this is what you're doing?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.893
I brought you the deal
of a lifetime,

00:59.927 --> 01:01.462
and you just spit in my face.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.765
Because I didn't want your deal.
Empire don't belong to you.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.800
There wouldn't be no Empire
if I hadn't of paved the way.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.269
(scoffs)

01:08.302 --> 01:11.772
Every door that you walk
through, I opened that for you.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.376
That's it, right there.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.245
Then I got bigger than you.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.913
I sold more records,

01:19.947 --> 01:21.449
went public,

01:21.482 --> 01:23.217
and you were no longer
the head Negro.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.919
-That's your problem.
-No, you the problem.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.958
What if I killed Shine...

01:30.991 --> 01:33.060
after 30 years of friendship?

01:33.093 --> 01:36.164
If I did that to him,
what do you think...

01:36.197 --> 01:37.665
COOKIE:
No! Not here.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.799
EDDIE:
Whoa.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.735
You think I came up in-in
the Lyon's den without...

01:41.769 --> 01:43.571
without a gun?

01:43.604 --> 01:46.740
What you gonna do?
You gonna stab me?

01:46.774 --> 01:47.975
Go ahead, stab me.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.477
Stab me!

01:51.179 --> 01:55.115
All right, that gets you
out the door, then what?

01:56.484 --> 01:59.353
Anything happens
to me or to mine,

01:59.387 --> 02:01.255
and my lawyer releases
a statement

02:01.289 --> 02:03.457
that puts out all of your little

02:03.491 --> 02:05.626
ghetto deeds,
your little ghettocides.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.864
You know what?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.033
The hundreds of millions
of dollars

02:13.066 --> 02:16.437
that you were gonna get
from the sale of Empire,

02:16.470 --> 02:18.138
you're gonna sign that
over to me.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.708
-(scoffs)
-'Cause you didn't want it.

02:20.741 --> 02:24.512
-And you don't deserve it.
-COOKIE: Oh, I see.

02:24.545 --> 02:28.516
So you a snitch, bitch,
and a thief.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.184
-Okay.
-Let's go.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.019
So take your
little sleezer slut

02:32.052 --> 02:34.288
and get the hell out
of my house.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.156
-Nobody's scared
of your guns around here.
-Stop.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.525
-Let's go.
-(laughs)

02:37.558 --> 02:39.960
-You better laugh.
-Let's go, Eddie.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.529
COOKIE:
Yeah, laugh, laugh now.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.563
The joke's on you

02:42.596 --> 02:44.365
'cause you should've
pulled the trigger, bitch.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.334
(Eddie laughs)

02:46.367 --> 02:48.336
*

02:53.407 --> 02:55.343
*

03:04.618 --> 03:06.153
All right, here.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.088
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.823
It doesn't matter if your father
pulled the trigger.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.526
If the D.A. can prove that
he ordered a hit on Shine,

03:12.560 --> 03:13.461
it's a wrap.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.364
So if Eddie takes
the scarf to the police,

03:16.397 --> 03:19.333
I can't beat it.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.502
Lucious.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.338
I can work miracles,
you know that.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.040
But they've been coming at you
for a long time,

03:27.074 --> 03:29.277
and now with this supposedly
hard physical evidence,

03:29.310 --> 03:30.944
they'll lock you up
and throw away the key.

03:30.978 --> 03:35.015
We need leverage.
Who has ideas?

03:35.048 --> 03:38.386
Yo, we could throw some
distortion on the kick.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.054
Nah. Keep it clean.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.756
I'll bring the distortion.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.892
Well, can we pay Eddie off?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.127
No. He wants blood.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.129
THIRSTY: Then we snatch
something he cares about.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.566
-Giselle?
-He doesn't care about her.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.567
* I been on a roll

03:53.601 --> 03:55.202
* Since I walked up
in the building *

03:55.235 --> 03:56.737
* Now they can't
forget the face *

03:56.770 --> 03:58.138
* Everything I do is fast

03:58.171 --> 03:59.440
* You can't forget the pace

03:59.473 --> 04:01.108
* Yelling,
"Who that young fella *

04:01.141 --> 04:02.376
* Dripping, need an umbrella"

04:02.410 --> 04:04.278
* Um, tell 'em, I'm coming

04:04.312 --> 04:05.579
* Like a fortune teller

04:05.613 --> 04:07.748
* One better, don't exist,
I admit I'm clever *

04:07.781 --> 04:11.218
* When you walk into the bank,
you not know one teller *

04:11.251 --> 04:13.421
* Oh, my goodness,
boy I'm back *

04:13.454 --> 04:15.389
-* And I'm winning
-* And I'm winning *

04:15.423 --> 04:16.757
-* That's a fact
-* That's a fact *

04:16.790 --> 04:18.492
-* I told 'em I'm-a do it
-* I'm-a do it *

04:18.526 --> 04:19.827
-* That's a wrap
-* That's a wrap *

04:19.860 --> 04:21.161
* Said they coming for my spot

04:21.194 --> 04:22.563
-* But where they at?
-* Where they at? *

04:22.596 --> 04:24.332
-* Where they at?
-* Where they at? *

04:24.365 --> 04:25.599
-* Where they at?
-* Where they at... *

04:25.633 --> 04:27.234
* Where they at?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.069
I have a way in,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.472
but it disgusts me
just thinking about it.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.582
* Why does it feel
like December? *

04:41.615 --> 04:46.119
* Lately your touch has been
colder than winter *

04:46.153 --> 04:50.524
* And I can remember it
differently, baby *

04:50.558 --> 04:53.527
* It ain't been warm
in forever *

04:53.561 --> 04:55.996
* But that's what we get
when we can't seem *

04:56.029 --> 04:58.198
* To figure it out

04:58.231 --> 05:01.969
* Really what we
fighting about? *

05:02.002 --> 05:03.471
* When I see you

05:03.504 --> 05:07.007
* I see a stranger
with one foot out the door *

05:07.040 --> 05:10.110
* And I try and try
to read you *

05:10.143 --> 05:12.713
* What can I do to reach you?

05:14.748 --> 05:17.518
* Oh, oh

05:17.551 --> 05:19.820
* But I ain't come this far

05:19.853 --> 05:23.290
* To lose you

05:23.323 --> 05:25.493
* It's never been this hard.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.729
(piano flourish)

05:28.762 --> 05:30.998
JAMAL:
All right, piano lady.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.801
That was beautiful.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.669
Where is everybody?
Aren't we supposed to rehearse?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.971
Well, Preacher
is doing some sort of

05:38.005 --> 05:39.407
"Breakfast Club" interview,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.809
and everybody else

05:41.842 --> 05:44.812
got great gig offers,
so it's just you and me.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.314
Yeah. All right, well,

05:47.347 --> 05:51.985
I guess they ain't tripping over
being in the spotlight no more.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.854
Well, it's not exactly like
we can be Anonymous

05:53.887 --> 05:55.656
when the entire world
knows who we are.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.724
Come on, don't act
like you didn't

05:56.757 --> 05:57.825
enjoy yourself
at the rent party.

05:57.858 --> 06:02.029
Yeah, and I know exactly
what comes after that.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.330
All of the tabloids
and the media,

06:03.363 --> 06:05.733
and that's exactly
what I didn't want.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.200
But we've dealt
with that before, Tory.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.670
-You know, I mean...
-You were willing to sacrifice

06:09.703 --> 06:11.071
me and the entire band

06:11.104 --> 06:12.706
the second that
your family came calling.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.910
Look, if everybody else wants
to chase fame, cool, let them.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.013
But guess what, my friend,
we have fans

06:20.047 --> 06:21.915
that are waiting for new music
from Anonymous.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.283
Why don't you get some rest.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.420
We'll meet later at Laviticus,
and we'll figure it out.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.889
Fine.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.961
(jazz music playing)

06:37.665 --> 06:40.100
Well, well, it's just like you

06:40.133 --> 06:42.970
to pick the bougie-est
place in town.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.405
-What do you want, Cookie?
-It's not what I want,

06:45.439 --> 06:47.107
it's what you want.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.811
You have proven to be quite
the opportunist who will...

06:50.844 --> 06:55.382
bust it open for anyone,
to get ahead.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.753
And here you are, yet again,
sucking up to Eddie.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.289
And for what?

07:02.322 --> 07:05.793
To go back to being head of A&R?
That's your dream?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.327
I'm gonna be CEO.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.630
(gasps, laughs)

07:09.663 --> 07:11.599
Is that... That's what
Eddie told you, huh?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.467
Eddie is using you,

07:13.501 --> 07:16.570
just like he used all of us.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.639
And when he is done with you,

07:18.672 --> 07:21.241
he will kick your ass
to the curb.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.344
What's your offer?

07:24.377 --> 07:29.282
Get me that scarf, and you will
have your independent imprint,

07:29.316 --> 07:31.852
all your own,
no strings attached.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.821
You will never hear
from us again.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.924
Besides, don't you want to run
something of your own?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.827
Instead of working under a man
all your life?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.428
I had something
of my own, Cookie.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.631
A career.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.667
Friends. The love of my life.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.168
But then you came along

07:48.201 --> 07:50.771
and proceeded
to take it all from me.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.105
And now you walk in here

07:52.139 --> 07:54.842
and act like you're
doing me a favor

07:54.875 --> 07:56.977
by offering me
what you took from me.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.113
So now you get
to sit back and watch

08:00.147 --> 08:02.850
while I sit on the throne
all by myself,

08:02.883 --> 08:05.653
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.188
You cannot bribe me
or threaten me

08:08.221 --> 08:11.725
because I am not afraid of you
or your family anymore.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.567
This is my time.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.977
* ...allowances, finesse a ...
with some counterfeits *

08:30.010 --> 08:31.579
* But now I'm countin' this

08:31.612 --> 08:33.313
* Parmesan where
my accountant lives *

08:33.346 --> 08:35.983
* In fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae *

08:36.016 --> 08:38.051
* Tastes like Kool-Aid
for the analysts... *

08:38.085 --> 08:40.821
Yo, I'm sorry I'm late.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.592
* That is good, won't you sit it
on my taste bloods? *

08:44.625 --> 08:45.726
* I get way too petty...

08:45.759 --> 08:47.561
(line ringing)

08:47.595 --> 08:50.497
(phone vibrating nearby)

08:50.530 --> 08:51.699
* A.M. to the P.M.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.067
* P.M. to the A.M., funk

08:54.101 --> 08:57.370
* ... out your diem, you just
got to hate 'em, funk *

08:57.404 --> 08:59.707
* If I quit your BM...

09:01.108 --> 09:03.577
Tory?

09:03.611 --> 09:05.412
Tory. Nuh-uh.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.948
Tory. What the...?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.717
Tory? Tory?

09:09.750 --> 09:10.918
Come on, come on.
Why would you...?

09:10.951 --> 09:12.452
Come on, come on.
No, no. Uh-uh.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.788
Somebody help us! Somebody!

09:20.794 --> 09:22.930
(Jamal vocalizing, humming)

09:32.439 --> 09:33.841
Are we back at rehab?

09:37.845 --> 09:39.379
Hey.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.182
Was that all a dream?

09:44.284 --> 09:48.221
No, it wasn't a dream, Tory.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.557
What were you thinking?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.994
(crying):
I wasn't.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.438
I can't do this anymore, Jamal.

10:05.472 --> 10:09.009
Being in the spotlight,
it just...

10:09.042 --> 10:12.079
It hurts too bad.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.181
We just...

10:14.214 --> 10:16.784
-We should--
we do need to slow down...
-Jamal.

10:18.485 --> 10:22.656
Haven't you ever
just wanted to be nobody?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.961
Yeah, sometimes.

10:30.130 --> 10:34.935
But we also don't have to be
high to be nobody. We don't...

10:34.968 --> 10:38.706
We don't have to be dead,
you know.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.108
You're never gonna be nobody.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.711
You're Jamal Lyon.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.528
Renee?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.699
Lucious.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.501
I'm-I'm meeting
my daughter for lunch.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.871
Yeah, you were
supposed to, but, um,

11:10.904 --> 11:14.775
something came up,
and she asked me to...

11:16.409 --> 11:17.978
Actually, I offered.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.749
I thought it was about time
you and I met face-to-face.

11:21.782 --> 11:27.420
Well, I... I'm thoroughly
acquainted with your face.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.990
I mean, it's plastered
all over the walls.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.193
It is all very impressive.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.195
"20 For 20," huh?

11:35.228 --> 11:40.067
Must feel good to have
a body of work to let you know

11:40.100 --> 11:43.937
that all those years of toil
wasn't in vain.

11:43.971 --> 11:49.542
Or in my daughter's case,
rotting in prison.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.253
Cookie said you would be tough.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.255
You surprised?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.391
I'm Cookie's mama.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.626
She's your daughter,

12:06.659 --> 12:09.963
but you weren't always
her mother, were you?

12:12.132 --> 12:14.601
Now, me and Cookie,
we've been through a lot

12:14.634 --> 12:16.636
over the years,
and, I mean, some of the things

12:16.669 --> 12:19.873
we went through
wasn't that pretty.

12:19.907 --> 12:23.043
But I never judged you
for your choices.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.413
I'm asking you that
you don't judge us for ours.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.449
I'm not gonna
rehash the past with you.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.751
Cookie gave up her freedom,

12:31.785 --> 12:35.122
years with her boys, because
she thinks she loves you.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.458
Uh, whether I believe that or
not, it really doesn't matter.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.429
What does matter
is that you love her

12:42.462 --> 12:44.431
just as much, in return.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.734
I love her with all of my heart.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.502
I promise.

12:49.536 --> 12:53.540
Pretty words from a pretty man.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.978
You tell my daughter to call me.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.416
Hmm.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.919
LUCIOUS:
Listen, baby,

13:05.953 --> 13:10.423
turning myself in
is the only way to save Empire.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.092
Will you please sit down
and just talk to me?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.527
No. Not if you're talking crazy.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.996
Well, you act like there's
some other way out of this.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.999
We have until tomorrow
to figure something out.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.801
Anything we do will
either jeopardize you,

13:21.835 --> 13:24.004
or jeopardize our family;
I'm not gonna allow it.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.505
What do you want me to do, huh?

13:25.538 --> 13:28.508
You want me to make a choice
between you or Empire?

13:28.541 --> 13:30.777
-You sound crazy!
-What, you think

13:30.810 --> 13:33.813
I want some has-been
to determine my fate?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.515
To tear down my legacy?

13:35.548 --> 13:39.152
It's my choice, it's not his,
and it's not yours.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.654
(sighs)

13:41.688 --> 13:44.357
We need to come up
with some dirt on Eddie.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.459
Fabricate something.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.028
I've already made my choice.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.829
You know what? Give me a gun,
I'll put two bullets

13:49.863 --> 13:52.332
in that bitch's skull.
You can't hear him squawking

13:52.365 --> 13:54.234
-from six feet under.
-Stop, stop, stop.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.735
Look at me.

13:57.737 --> 14:01.308
Now, you've spent half of your
life in prison for our family.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.609
It's my turn.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.980
Let me be the man
that's worthy of your love.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.748
-Please.
-No.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.384
Lucious, there's got to be
a different way, come on.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.155
Yo, what's the word?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.723
Anything we need to know?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.796
I need to talk to you, son.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.701
Here.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.642
(sighs)

14:37.410 --> 14:41.381
I've decided to turn myself in
for Shine's murder.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.621
Um, before I do this,
I need you to prepare a bid

14:48.655 --> 14:53.360
to buy Empire back,
exterminate the rats,

14:53.393 --> 14:56.363
and I need you to make sure
that there's a Lyon

14:56.396 --> 14:58.798
that's seated on that throne.

15:00.467 --> 15:04.737
I'm the one that should be
locked away, not you.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.739
If I hadn't brought Shine
into my plans,

15:06.773 --> 15:08.375
-you wouldn't be...
-Oh, no, no. You...

15:08.408 --> 15:11.611
Let me take the fall, Pop.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.613
All I've ever done
is disappoint you.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.581
Disappoint me?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.783
You helped me build Empire.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.253
You took it from the Philly
streets to Wall Street.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.990
You did this, Andre!

15:23.023 --> 15:25.558
I mean, she needs you.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.494
I don't care about running
the company anymore, Pop!

15:27.527 --> 15:29.229
I'm not talking
about the company.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.598
I'm talking about your mother.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
She's gonna need you...

15:37.470 --> 15:42.309
...more than ever,
because I'm not gonna be there.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.082
And out of all of them,

15:49.116 --> 15:52.252
you're the one
that's most like me.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.122
What'd you say?

15:57.724 --> 15:59.926
That fire in you?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.828
I put that there.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.165
I did that. That's the Lyon.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.701
That's me.

16:08.735 --> 16:12.339
And maybe you got sick,
because all those years,

16:12.372 --> 16:15.675
you've been trying to suppress
your real nature.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.444
I mean, you are a Lyon.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.380
A Lyon roars,
and I put you in those schools

16:20.413 --> 16:22.515
with white people--
it's my fault,

16:22.549 --> 16:24.684
because I was trying
to make you less threatening.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.553
I did that.

16:26.586 --> 16:32.192
And more than the others,
you have me in you.

16:32.225 --> 16:36.563
You're the Lyon, son.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.867
Pop, I...

16:40.900 --> 16:45.572
I need you to promise me

16:45.605 --> 16:48.808
that you're gonna
look after your mother,

16:48.841 --> 16:52.412
and look after this family.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.086
I promise.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.254
(sniffles)

17:05.958 --> 17:08.728
I love you, son.

17:11.264 --> 17:16.403
(crying):
I-I love you too, Pop.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.537
(sniffles)

17:30.783 --> 17:33.286
Andre, you got the bid prepared?

17:36.623 --> 17:37.924
$750 million.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.026
So that seals it.
We can get Empire back.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.495
It's not that easy, son.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.064
LUCIOUS:
Look here.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.700
You all need
to know something. Um...

17:47.734 --> 17:50.637
Eddie's trying to blackmail me.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.142
He says if the bid
doesn't go to him,

17:55.175 --> 17:58.678
he's gonna pin
Shine's murder on me.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.316
What the hell is wrong with him?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.118
What, he's pulling crimes
out of thin air now?

18:05.152 --> 18:06.619
To hell with him, Dad.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.722
You need proof, first of all,
to convict somebody.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.192
He's got it.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.328
I killed Shine.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.331
What the hell you just say?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.501
Mom, you knew about this?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.238
Shine came after
your father, son.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.574
Everybody comes after Dad.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.008
How's that possibly
a reason to...

18:29.041 --> 18:30.310
ANDRE:
Shine helped me plant the bomb

18:30.343 --> 18:31.578
in Vegas.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.912
You lying.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.614
COOKIE:
Calm down, boy.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.984
Shine was nothing but a thug
who used every opportunity

18:38.017 --> 18:39.752
to steal from this family.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.588
HAKEEM: Yeah, but he might
have been a thug,

18:41.621 --> 18:44.123
but while you were
finger painting with your nurse,

18:44.157 --> 18:46.993
he had my back.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.462
Sit down, Hakeem.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.504
So, we lost Mom for 17 years,

18:57.537 --> 19:00.173
now we lose you
for the rest of your life,

19:00.207 --> 19:02.942
all to continue
to save some company

19:02.975 --> 19:05.612
that does nothing
but destroy our family?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.115
Mal has a point.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.651
Maybe we should
think about this.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.486
Yeah, maybe we need
to think about all

19:13.520 --> 19:17.324
that Empire consistently
takes from us.

19:17.357 --> 19:22.028
Dad, if it's gonna save you,
then let Eddie have it.

19:22.061 --> 19:27.900
What Empire...
has taken from us?

19:31.771 --> 19:35.141
What about what it's given us?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.244
What about all the artists
that we create

19:37.277 --> 19:42.649
that make music
which comforts people,

19:42.682 --> 19:45.685
that helps them through
the worst of times.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.588
Look at what it's given
everybody here at this table.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.258
I mean, we...

19:51.291 --> 19:54.994
we make music
that will live eternally.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.498
It's worth any sacrifice

19:58.531 --> 20:02.068
that any of us
will ever have to make.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.446
(indistinct chatter)

20:18.985 --> 20:21.688
Hey. It's good to see you.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.423
The Patel bid.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.462
Thank you.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.589
Thank you.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.594
LEONARD:
As you all know,

21:01.628 --> 21:04.063
the highest bidder,
whom we deem credible

21:04.096 --> 21:07.400
and responsible,
will win Empire.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.303
Now the Eddie Barker,
Kelly Patel bid.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.276
$700 million.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.411
(all murmuring)

21:18.445 --> 21:20.747
We made way more than that
with the rent party.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.181
-We got this.
-Yes!

21:22.214 --> 21:24.817
I'll now open the bid
from the Lyon family.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.324
Zero dollars?

21:31.358 --> 21:32.659
-What?
-What?

21:32.692 --> 21:34.527
What?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.936
This is rigged.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.372
No, it's not.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.273
You did this?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.308
Yeah, I did it.
Damn right, I did it.

21:49.342 --> 21:53.680
See, what y'all don't understand
is that Empire

21:53.713 --> 21:55.682
is not just a building.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.451
It's not even just its artists.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.687
It's us, the Lyons,

22:00.720 --> 22:04.524
and we shouldn't pay
another dime

22:04.557 --> 22:06.893
for the Empire we built

22:06.926 --> 22:09.529
when Empire's most
valuable asset

22:09.562 --> 22:12.799
is this family.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.333
Does the board accept our bid?

22:22.341 --> 22:25.478
The board accepts Eddie Barker
and Kelly Patel's

22:25.512 --> 22:28.481
$700 million bid for Empire.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.983
EDNA:
Congratulations.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.752
KELLY:
Thank you.

22:32.785 --> 22:33.986
Why would you do that?!

22:34.020 --> 22:36.355
You just gave away Empire!

22:41.260 --> 22:42.995
I did it for that.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.097
Yes, Empire is precious,

22:45.131 --> 22:48.267
but your freedom means
more to me.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.937
That wasn't your call.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.406
Our sons need their father,

22:53.440 --> 22:55.041
and I need my man.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.343
JAMAL: Hey, y'all can always
rebuild Empire,

22:57.376 --> 22:58.878
but you can't get
that time back.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.880
Exactly.
We still got the money

23:00.913 --> 23:02.615
from the rent party,
so we good.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.216
All the money we raised
with the rent party

23:04.250 --> 23:06.118
has to be returned, since
our bid didn't go through.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.587
-Those were the conditions.
-Look, we still gonna

23:07.620 --> 23:10.022
make a killing off of selling
the Empire shares to Patel.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.124
ANDRE: Yeah, well,
Eddie is forcing us

23:12.158 --> 23:13.460
to hand over that money
in exchange

23:13.493 --> 23:14.927
for keeping quiet about Shine.

23:14.961 --> 23:17.096
You just the one with
the good news today, huh?

23:17.129 --> 23:18.765
Shut up!

23:18.798 --> 23:21.901
All I hear is fear.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.369
I didn't marry a scared man,

23:23.402 --> 23:25.605
and I damn sure did not bring

23:25.638 --> 23:27.874
three scared men
into this world.

23:27.907 --> 23:32.545
Yes! We will have to rebuild
Empire from scratch.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.280
Is it scary?
Hell yeah!

23:34.313 --> 23:36.115
Is it gonna be hard? Yes!

23:36.148 --> 23:38.451
But you know what
the difference is?

23:38.485 --> 23:40.152
This time, I'm here,

23:40.186 --> 23:42.755
and I done been through
way too much

23:42.789 --> 23:45.758
to give up now, so...
we have each other.

23:47.326 --> 23:50.162
We made a plan...

23:50.196 --> 23:52.398
and a promise that
we would not make a move

23:52.431 --> 23:55.802
without the other person.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.705
You didn't have that right.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.168
(playing melancholy melody)

24:29.201 --> 24:32.138
*

24:40.747 --> 24:42.014
No other music company has ever
accomplished what...

24:42.048 --> 24:43.950
Don't forget to thank me, baby.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.185
Let's talk business, shall we?

24:46.218 --> 24:49.055
None of this would have existed
without me!

24:49.088 --> 24:52.058
Not those gold records!
Not those plaques!

24:54.226 --> 24:57.063
(crying):
I did 17 years for this family.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.231
You built this company
on my back!

25:02.368 --> 25:05.271
*

25:11.010 --> 25:13.913
* Found a love I can lean on

25:13.946 --> 25:17.684
LUCIOUS: Empire has been around
for almost 20 years

25:17.717 --> 25:19.686
because of the love
and support of family.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.387
LUCIOUS:
I want you to know that I would

25:21.420 --> 25:25.658
trade this company
and everything I've ever had

25:25.692 --> 25:29.061
to make sure I never
lose you again.

25:29.095 --> 25:32.599
*

25:32.632 --> 25:34.533
(chuckles)

25:34.567 --> 25:36.903
(Cookie laughing)

25:39.038 --> 25:40.973
*

25:46.112 --> 25:48.047
(plays final note)

26:06.432 --> 26:08.567
*

26:21.347 --> 26:24.784
Uh... where's our car?

26:24.817 --> 26:27.586
I forgot.
That's, um, Empire's car.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.221
Oh... (sighs)

26:29.255 --> 26:31.157
(both laughing)

26:31.190 --> 26:32.424
-Hey, Webb.
-Yeah?

26:32.458 --> 26:33.993
Will you get us
a cab or something?

26:34.026 --> 26:35.294
Yes, sir.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.663
Lord, have mercy...

26:36.696 --> 26:37.997
I know I should be angry

26:38.030 --> 26:40.299
after all that's happened,
but, man...

26:40.332 --> 26:42.669
thinking about what you said
in there

26:42.702 --> 26:47.106
about that just being a building
without Lyons in it...

26:47.139 --> 26:49.308
Empire's in the heart.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.111
You were really willing
to go to prison

26:52.144 --> 26:54.246
so we could keep Empire?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.515
I was gonna go to prison
for you.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.518
You know, you been talking
a lot of smack

26:59.551 --> 27:01.087
about us getting back together,

27:01.120 --> 27:03.089
you wanting me back
and respecting me.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.458
For the first time,
I can feel it.

27:09.495 --> 27:13.632
Hey, we gonna take
this place back.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.473
Hi, um, Jamal Lyon
to see Tory Ash.

27:21.507 --> 27:25.544
Mr. Lyon. We...
tried to call you earlier.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.513
I'm sorry,
I kind of got wrapped up

27:27.546 --> 27:28.815
in some family stuff.
How's she doing?

27:28.848 --> 27:30.883
Tory suffered
a grand mal seizure.

27:30.917 --> 27:34.120
It's not uncommon for people
suffering with addiction.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.154
Okay.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.523
We tried to resuscitate her...

27:37.556 --> 27:39.525
Wait, what do you mean
"resuscitate her"?

27:39.558 --> 27:43.395
She's gone, Jamal.
I'm sorry.

27:58.577 --> 28:00.713
(elevator bell dings)

28:05.184 --> 28:09.321
I heard what happened to Tory.
I'm so sorry, baby.

28:09.355 --> 28:12.024
Yeah, it's really sad.

28:12.058 --> 28:15.094
Why are you packing?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.663
'Cause I'm leaving, Ma.

28:17.696 --> 28:22.368
I need to... get out of here
and go somewhere.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.203
Oh. Oh, I get it.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.438
You need a vacation. I...
(exhales sharply)

28:26.472 --> 28:30.509
No, Ma, it's not like that.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.578
I'm really leaving.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.918
I need to be nobody
for a minute.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.452
And I can't do that here.

28:40.486 --> 28:44.123
But, Jamal, it's more important
now than ever

28:44.156 --> 28:45.758
that the family sticks together.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.998
Please.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.769
That's what I've always done...

28:56.803 --> 28:59.939
but th-there's always
gonna be something, Mom.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.607
Always.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.376
Where you gonna go?

29:04.410 --> 29:07.446
I don't even know,
I just, I...

29:09.982 --> 29:11.984
I just want to disappear.

29:12.018 --> 29:15.788
No. No, Jamal.

29:15.822 --> 29:20.793
You are a part of my heart.
You can't disappear.

29:27.299 --> 29:31.270
Ma, I need for you to let me go.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.306
All right? Please.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.944
No, no. No, no...

29:39.645 --> 29:42.148
JAMAL:
I love you.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.084
I love you so much.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.286
(sniffles)

29:53.059 --> 29:54.260
I want two,
maybe three security guys.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.661
-Okay.
-Guide these people along.

29:55.694 --> 29:59.265
Ha! I can't believe
that this day is finally here.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.433
-I mean, we did it.
-Finally.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.668
We actually beat them.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.204
Look, I think,
for the press conference,

30:05.237 --> 30:06.605
you should be
a little less gleeful...

30:06.638 --> 30:08.607
-Okay.
-...and focus more on the future

30:08.640 --> 30:10.843
of Empire under
our new leadership.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.544
-Okay?
-Okay, I know, girl, I know,

30:12.578 --> 30:14.513
but you don't know
my history with this family.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.348
-I can only imagine.
-You just got to give me

30:16.382 --> 30:17.683
this moment.

30:17.716 --> 30:18.617
All right.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.020
Just... little moment.
(laughs)

30:21.053 --> 30:23.122
-GISELLE: I'll see you in there.
-I'll be right there.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.756
(chuckles)

30:28.194 --> 30:30.262
Congratulations, Anika.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.901
I just wanted
to wish you the best.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.038
Do I need to call security?

30:39.071 --> 30:40.539
Oh, no. No need.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.741
You bested the Lyons
at business. You won.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.150
I'm done blaming you, Anika.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.818
I don't have to.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.687
You know, I know what it's like
to have a guilty conscience.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.458
How it can haunt you.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.239
It's time for both of us
to move on.

31:13.272 --> 31:17.643
We got a lot more life to live
without holding on to the past.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.280
Truce.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.655
Truce.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.332
Andre.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.805
Good luck.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.575
You, too.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.315
*

31:58.150 --> 31:59.685
(exhales)

32:10.129 --> 32:12.264
You're just gonna
give it all up?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.300
Ma, you don't understand.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.436
You're damn right,
I do not understand.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.906
You gave up
prime years of your life,

32:20.939 --> 32:23.742
you said so your magnificent
Empire could be built,

32:23.775 --> 32:26.912
and now you're just
gonna toss it away to somebody?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.982
We had no choice.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.750
Ah.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.252
I get it.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.521
Got something to do
with old yella, don't it?

32:35.554 --> 32:39.992
Lucious is a changed man, okay?
I love him.

32:40.026 --> 32:42.794
-Okay? So just...
-Girl. Girl.

32:42.828 --> 32:45.697
I can't fight you on this.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.767
But do not let your love
for a grown man

32:48.800 --> 32:50.336
who is not your son

32:50.369 --> 32:53.339
make a fool out of you, again.

32:53.372 --> 32:57.043
I'm sorry,
am I interrupting something?

32:57.909 --> 32:59.611
No.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.014
No, you didn't.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.350
I got to go.

33:04.383 --> 33:05.517
Cookie.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.220
-We'll see you.
-Okay.

33:08.254 --> 33:09.955
-Soon.
-Yes.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.258
-All right, Cookie.
-Okay.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.527
Lucious.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.364
(Cookie sighs heavily)

33:18.397 --> 33:20.032
(door opens, closes)

33:20.066 --> 33:22.534
How much of that did you hear?

33:22.568 --> 33:23.835
I heard enough.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.904
Sorry.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.340
Listen...

33:28.374 --> 33:30.509
if we're gonna start over,

33:30.542 --> 33:33.245
I think we should do it
the right way.

33:33.279 --> 33:36.315
Yes, you're right.
That is why we have

33:36.348 --> 33:39.151
to get on this talent,
because, you know, Jamal is...

33:39.185 --> 33:41.153
What are you doing down there?

33:41.187 --> 33:42.621
(Lucious sighs)

33:45.124 --> 33:47.426
Cookie, I want you
to be my wife,

33:47.459 --> 33:50.096
and I want to start over
as your husband.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.730
(laughing)

33:51.763 --> 33:53.732
Lucious, get off the floor,

33:53.765 --> 33:56.402
with that gimp leg and...

33:58.437 --> 34:01.039
I thought that
might shut you up.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.844
Now, baby, I know, um...

34:05.877 --> 34:10.082
I've given you
more than enough reasons to...

34:10.116 --> 34:12.351
to doubt me,

34:12.384 --> 34:15.521
and I'm sorry for that.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.257
But with this ring, I promise
that I'm going to love you

34:18.290 --> 34:19.691
for the rest of my life

34:19.725 --> 34:22.261
and that...

34:22.294 --> 34:24.963
I want you to marry me.

34:25.997 --> 34:28.467
Cookie, will you marry me?

34:33.739 --> 34:37.343
Okay, I mean,
if-if-if this is real, then...

34:38.977 --> 34:41.447
...I really need you
to put us first,

34:41.480 --> 34:46.152
Lucious, put me first,
put... me before Empire,

34:46.185 --> 34:48.420
before anybody.
I-I have to...

34:48.454 --> 34:51.657
Come on, man,
you gonna say yes or no?

34:54.326 --> 34:56.295
(sighs)

34:59.265 --> 35:00.599
Yes.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.303
-Make you sweat a little.
-(laughing)

35:08.440 --> 35:10.108
It's beautiful.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.911
-Come on.
-Come on where?

35:12.944 --> 35:15.614
-I want to call the judge.
-No, not now. We need the boys.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.116
-The boys have to witness this.
-No... Wait.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.051
My babies got to see this.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.159
This moment...

35:27.193 --> 35:29.261
I don't want to lose it.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.597
(softly):
Okay.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.599
-Come on.
-Okay.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.700
(knocking)

35:36.468 --> 35:37.969
Oh.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.507
You're not answering your phone.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.042
Well, I ain't got nowhere
I got to be.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.513
Nobody I got to see.
Thanks to your man Eddie

35:47.546 --> 35:48.847
taking my Empire.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.182
Thank you.

35:50.216 --> 35:52.984
Look, Hakeem, my head
has been all switched up

35:53.018 --> 35:56.021
in every which way lately,
with my-my...

35:56.054 --> 35:59.325
career and my album, with Eddie.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.194
Look, I ain't got time
for whatever this is.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.899
I'm pregnant.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.373
And it's yours.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.377
I haven't been with anyone else,

36:18.410 --> 36:21.146
because I can't seem to be
with anyone else but you.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.350
And right now I am so scared,
and I don't know what to do.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.586
(whispers):
Wow...

36:27.619 --> 36:29.154
Wait.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.190
You're pregnant with my baby?

36:34.360 --> 36:36.562
*

36:40.131 --> 36:41.833
-Don't worry.
-(sniffles)

36:41.867 --> 36:43.735
We're gonna figure this out.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.904
It's always been
me and you, Tiana.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.347
Leading Empire into the future
is our new CEO,

36:55.381 --> 36:58.149
Anika Calhoun.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.086
Thank you.

37:01.119 --> 37:05.023
Thank you, Eddie.
Thank you so much.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.892
Wow. This is surreal,

37:06.925 --> 37:09.194
to be able to return
to the Empire family

37:09.227 --> 37:13.031
and, um, to...
I guess, sit on the throne.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.568
-(laughter)
-Um, but with my amazing team
behind me,

37:16.602 --> 37:18.370
I just know
that there is nothing that

37:18.404 --> 37:21.907
-we won't be able t...
-(baby crying)

37:23.575 --> 37:25.977
(baby continues crying)

37:28.246 --> 37:30.916
(quiet chatter)

37:30.949 --> 37:32.150
(exhales)

37:32.183 --> 37:34.286
Okay, um...
(chuckles)

37:34.320 --> 37:35.387
I'm sorry.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.155
Questions. Any questions?

37:37.188 --> 37:38.324
(reporters shouting)

37:38.357 --> 37:39.725
-Ms. Calhoun.
-Yes?

37:39.758 --> 37:42.328
What are your goals
for Empire as CEO?

37:42.361 --> 37:45.397
Well, um, the first goal that we
were thinking about implementing

37:45.431 --> 37:47.966
-that we think will really...
-WOMAN: I have a question.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.268
Are you aware
of the remarkably high number

37:50.302 --> 37:54.773
of CEOs who are
clinical psychopaths?

37:57.709 --> 38:00.045
(whispers):
What is happening?

38:02.013 --> 38:03.549
Ms. Calhoun?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.791
This is your new CEO?

38:12.824 --> 38:15.293
Can this bitch
even pass a drug test?

38:15.327 --> 38:17.095
-Okay.
-Mm-mm.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.499
-Let me step in for a second.
-Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No. No. I'm good.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.701
-Okay.
-I am good. Um...

38:22.734 --> 38:24.269
-Ms. Calhoun! Ms. Calhoun!
-Ms. Calhoun!

38:24.302 --> 38:27.873
-Yes?
-Can there even be an Empire
without the Lyons?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.208
Well, um, during Empire's
most profitable years,

38:30.241 --> 38:34.713
I was the head of A&R,
and so I have no doubt that...

38:34.746 --> 38:37.949
How many lives did you destroy
to get your little come-up...

38:37.983 --> 38:40.118
(mockingly):
Anika?

38:40.151 --> 38:42.120
(whispering):
I have to go.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.323
I have to go.
I have to go.

38:47.893 --> 38:51.630
Uh, Ms. Calhoun just needed
to get some fresh air.

38:51.663 --> 38:52.731
But I just wanted to say

38:52.764 --> 38:54.366
that this-this moment
is surreal for me

38:54.400 --> 38:56.134
because I grew up with...

38:56.167 --> 38:57.335
(gasps)

38:57.369 --> 38:59.070
What did you do to me?

38:59.104 --> 39:01.807
Smile for the cameras.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.841
*

39:02.874 --> 39:05.844
LUCIOUS:
I need you to promise me

39:05.877 --> 39:08.514
that you're
gonna look after this family.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.182
You are a Lyon.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.718
A Lyon roars.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.953
(gasping)

39:16.354 --> 39:17.756
(Kelly continues indistinctly)

39:17.789 --> 39:19.157
(panting)

39:19.190 --> 39:21.560
ANDRE:
I know what it's like

39:21.593 --> 39:22.894
to have a guilty conscience.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.029
How it can haunt you.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.610
(gasping)

39:43.782 --> 39:46.418
Karma's a bitch.

39:46.452 --> 39:47.953
(screams)

39:56.327 --> 39:59.064
(screams)

39:59.097 --> 40:00.398
What the hell?

40:05.236 --> 40:07.338
(weak, wheezing breaths)

40:27.993 --> 40:29.928
*

40:35.667 --> 40:38.136
You know, when we did this
the first time...

40:38.169 --> 40:41.306
they just checked the I.D.s
to make sure we were legal,

40:41.339 --> 40:43.308
then voilà, we were married.

40:43.341 --> 40:45.744
I want more this time.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.747
Well, I can...
poot out some vows...

40:48.780 --> 40:50.749
(chuckles) right off the dome,
if you'd like.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.951
Oh, well,
did you bring a DJ?

40:52.984 --> 40:54.285
You gonna strike up a beat,

40:54.319 --> 40:56.154
-gonna freestyle?
-(chuckles)

40:56.187 --> 40:57.589
JUDGE:
I've found simple works best.

40:57.623 --> 41:00.358
Just speak from your heart.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.700
Are you ready?

41:08.734 --> 41:12.337
("Ain't No Mountain High Enough"
by Marvin Gaye playing)

41:19.711 --> 41:23.048
You are my breath.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.551
You're my song.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.622
You're the chorus
that plays in my head.

41:30.656 --> 41:34.860
You're the lights that I see
when I close my eyes.

41:36.061 --> 41:38.196
You're my everything, Cookie.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.132
(takes deep breath)

41:41.166 --> 41:43.535
We've been through the fire...

41:44.870 --> 41:48.339
...and I know our future holds
more storms,

41:48.373 --> 41:51.977
but... what I do know

41:52.010 --> 41:54.345
is that with you by my side,

41:54.379 --> 41:57.583
I can get through anything.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.852
JUDGE: No other human ties
are more tender,

42:00.886 --> 42:05.090
no other vows more sacred
than those you assume now.

42:05.123 --> 42:10.095
* 'Cause, baby, there ain't
no mountain high enough *

42:10.128 --> 42:11.597
* Ain't no valley...

42:11.630 --> 42:13.999
JUDGE: In your journey
through this life,

42:14.032 --> 42:15.767
I require and charge you both

42:15.801 --> 42:19.004
to remember
that love and loyalty alone

42:19.037 --> 42:21.907
will avail as the foundation
of a happy home

42:21.940 --> 42:23.575
and meaningful life.

42:23.609 --> 42:27.345
* It's time to be a man now

42:27.378 --> 42:30.348
* I don't need it,
you can keep your money *

42:30.381 --> 42:31.850
* I don't want it

42:31.883 --> 42:34.085
* If you're gonna throw it up
in my face *

42:34.119 --> 42:36.588
* Makes the world go round...

42:36.622 --> 42:38.256
* If you're ever in trouble,
I'll be there on the double *

42:38.289 --> 42:41.126
If these solemn vows
be kept inviolate,

42:41.159 --> 42:45.897
your life will be full
of joy and peace.

42:45.931 --> 42:50.035
Two separate souls
joined together as one,

42:50.068 --> 42:51.703
to share desires,

42:51.737 --> 42:54.272
dreams, memories

42:54.305 --> 42:56.307
and all uncertainties.

42:56.341 --> 42:59.510
* Don't you know that
there ain't no. *

43:00.846 --> 43:02.413
Hakeem... he's got a gun!

43:02.447 --> 43:04.415
-Dad, what are you doing?!
-(gun cocks)

43:04.449 --> 43:07.152
-No!
-(three gunshots)

43:07.185 --> 43:09.054
(echoing gunshot fades)

43:09.087 --> 43:10.922
JUDGE:
Lucious...

43:10.956 --> 43:13.992
and Cookie...

43:14.025 --> 43:15.727
I now pronounce you

43:15.761 --> 43:17.796
husband and wife.

43:17.829 --> 43:22.300
* 'Cause, baby, there ain't
no mountain high enough *

43:22.333 --> 43:26.071
* Ain't no valley low enough

43:26.104 --> 43:27.639
* Ain't no river.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.720

Media Access Group at WGBH

44:07.813 --> 44:09.848
Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:09.881 --> 44:12.383
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:13.985 --> 44:15.954

-(audience cheering)

44:27.733 --> 44:29.500
and a brand-new DJ.

44:29.534 --> 44:32.838
She's talented.
She's incredible.
She's my daughter Corinne.

44:32.871 --> 44:36.007
Finally, someone
who can keep Jamie in check.

44:36.041 --> 44:38.043
Dad, Dad.
