14:15.550 --> 14:17.987
HE'S HOLDING HIS OWN.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN,

14:18.031 --> 14:20.163
BUT WE NEED TO GET HIM TO
A HOSPITAL AND PUMP HIS STOMACH.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.296
I'M GONNA GO WITH JANE.
CHO, YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.646
YOU TWO PUSH ON
THE INVESTIGATION.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.866
IT'S OKAY.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.346
YOU KNOW
THAT MENDELSSOHN CUT

14:29.390 --> 14:31.522
SOME OF THE RAREST STONES
OF HIS TIME?

14:31.566 --> 14:33.176
HE WAS CONSIDERED
A MASTER.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.786
YOU HAVE HIS CLIENT LIST?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.701
[chuckles] YEAH,
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS THING.[paper rustles]

14:36.745 --> 14:39.530
LEADERS OF INDUSTRY, ROYALTY,
HOLLYWOOD STARS.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.054
YEAH, WE NEED
TO RUN THEM DOWN.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.534
I'M ALL OVER IT. I ALREADY
HAVE A CALL IN TO CLOONEY.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.885
PRELIMINARY
FORENSICS REPORT.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.539
THERE WERE NO USEABLE PRINTS
ON THE TEAPOT OR BOWL.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.150
WELL, EXCEPT
FOR JANE'S PRINTS.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.369
GREAT. SMUDGING FINGERPRINTS,
DRINKING EVIDENCE--

14:52.413 --> 14:53.849
HE'S LIKE A DRUNK UNCLE.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.721
WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRIC SAW
THAT WAS USED ON THE VICTIM?

14:56.765 --> 14:58.854
TWO SETS OF PRINTS.
ONE BELONGS TO MENDELSSOHN,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.682
THE OTHER UNIDENTIFIED.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.640
M.E. PUTS TIME OF DEATH
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.555
NOW LISBON SAID
THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR

15:04.599 --> 15:07.732
HEARD MENDELSSOHN ARGUING WITH
A MAN IN HIS KITCHEN LAST NIGHT.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.169
DID MENDELSSOHN LIVE ALONE?

15:09.212 --> 15:11.519
HE WAS SHARING HIS HOME
WITH HIS DAUGHTER MELAINA.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.695
GUESS SHE HIT HARD TIMES
LAST YEAR AND MOVED IN.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.218
SHE WRITES CHILDREN'S BOOKS.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.611
WHERE WAS SHE
LAST NIGHT?

15:16.654 --> 15:18.569
BIG SUR. RENTED A CABIN
TO WORK ON A BOOK.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.180
I NOTIFIED HER THIS MORNING.
SHE'S DRIVING HOME NOW.

15:20.223 --> 15:21.746
YEAH. DEFINITELY MEET
WITH THE DAUGHTER.OKAY.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.226
SEE IF SHE KNOWS WHO WAS
AT THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT.RIGHT.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.967
DID THE VICTIM HAVE
ANY COWORKERS?

15:25.011 --> 15:27.056
AN ASSISTANT NAMED
JULIAN GALLEGO.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.884
BRING HIM IN.
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU FIND.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.233
MM.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.934
[phone rings]IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.110
CBI.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.850
OH, YEAH. MR. CLOONEY.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.069
YEAH, THIS IS AGENT CHO.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.419
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.466
[police radio chatter,
indistinct conversations]

15:48.730 --> 15:51.994
[woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.]

15:52.038 --> 15:54.997
THIS WAY. THIS WAY, PLEASE.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.478
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE.IS HE GONNA BE O--

15:59.349 --> 16:02.396
VIKTOR WAS LIKE STRADIVARI.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.789
HE COULD, UH, HEAR A FLAW
IN THE DIAMOND

16:04.833 --> 16:07.401
BY THE WAY HIS GRINDING WHEEL
CHANGED ITS SONG.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.925
HOW LONG DID YOU
WORK FOR HIM, JULIAN?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.405
FOUR YEARS.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.886
WHO'S GOING TO TEACH ME NOW?
THERE IS NO ONE LIKE VIKTOR.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.497
WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE HIM?

16:16.540 --> 16:18.194
YESTERDAY.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.501
WE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
IN THE WORKSHOP TOGETHER.

16:20.544 --> 16:23.069
HE WAS SHOWING ME
HOW TO OPEN A WINDOW.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.374
A WINDOW?

16:24.418 --> 16:27.203
[breathes deeply
and sips]

16:27.247 --> 16:29.510
BEFORE MAKING THE FIRST CUT,

16:29.553 --> 16:32.382
VIKTOR WOULD SPEND WEEKS
GETTING TO KNOW A RARE GEM.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.297
YOU HAVE TO, UH,
POLISH A WINDOW

16:34.341 --> 16:36.299
IN THE CLOUDY SURFACE
OF THE STONE

16:36.343 --> 16:38.040
SO THAT YOU CAN PEER
INTO ITS HEART.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.737
SOUNDS ROMANTIC.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.130
IT IS.

16:41.174 --> 16:45.308
A CARELESS CUT CAN
SHATTER YOUR TREASURE.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.528
DID YOUR BOSS
COME INTO POSSESSION

16:47.571 --> 16:49.008
OF ANY RARE GEMS LATELY?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.226
OH, YES.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.969
A 102-CARAT BLUE DIAMOND.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.145
MOST MASTER CUTTERS WILL
TURN INTO OLD MEN

16:56.189 --> 16:59.583
AND--AND NEVER TOUCH
A DIAMOND OVER, UH, 50 CARATS.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.586
100 CARATS? HOW MUCH IS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WORTH?

17:02.630 --> 17:05.198
WELL, IT'S JUST A CHUNK
OF ROUGH CRYSTAL NOW,

17:05.241 --> 17:08.288
BUT AFTER VIKTOR
WAS THROUGH WITH IT...

17:08.331 --> 17:10.333
$20 MILLION.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.510
AND WHERE IS THAT DIAMOND?

17:13.554 --> 17:15.121
VIKTOR TOOK IT HOME WITH HIM.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.906
HE TOOK ALL OF HIS CLIENTS'
STONES HOME WITH HIM AT NIGHT.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.082
HE KEPT THEM CLOSE

17:20.126 --> 17:23.346
IN A...
HIDDEN SHOULDER WALLET.

17:24.782 --> 17:28.525
THERE WAS NO SHOULDER WALLET
FOUND ON VIKTOR'S BODY.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.701
DID ANYONE HAVE IT OUT
FOR YOUR BOSS?

17:30.745 --> 17:33.139
FAHAD. FAHAD THREATENED HIM.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.531
WHO'S THAT?

17:34.575 --> 17:36.794
FAHAD RANJANI.
ANOTHER DIAMOND CUTTER.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.361
UH, MINOR TALENT.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.929
THE BLUE ORCHID IS
A CAREER-MAKING STONE.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.018
FAHAD THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO HIM.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.889
THE BLUE ORCHID?

17:44.933 --> 17:47.631
BLUE ORCHID?THAT'S RIGHT.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.373
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST CONTACT
WITH YOUR FATHER, MELAINA?

17:50.417 --> 17:52.158
[voice shaking] MM...
YESTERDAY MORNING.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.377
I-I CALLED HIM
FROM THE CABIN.

17:54.421 --> 17:57.032
AND HE DIDN'T INDICATE
THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.512
ON THE CONTRARY.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.254
HE WAS SO EXCITED
ABOUT THAT NEW STONE.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.386
ACCORDING TO HIS
ASSISTANT JULIAN,

18:03.430 --> 18:06.389
HE LIKED TO HIDE HIS CLIENTS'
GEMS ON HIS BODY?

18:06.433 --> 18:08.565
[chuckles]

18:08.609 --> 18:11.438
DAD NEVER TOOK OFF
THAT BEAT-UP SHOULDER POUCH.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.615
EVEN IN BED.
DROVE MOM CRAZY.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.573
AND WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

18:16.617 --> 18:20.099
HE WAS RAISED NOT TO TRUST
SECURITY SERVICES.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.536
HIS FATHER WAS
A GERMAN JEW WHO...

18:22.579 --> 18:24.190
SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST

18:24.233 --> 18:26.714
ONLY TO HAVE THE BANK
STEAL THE FAMILY MONEY.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.455
AND DID ANYONE OTHER THAN
YOU AND JULIAN

18:28.498 --> 18:29.891
KNOW ABOUT
THE SHOULDER POUCH?

18:29.934 --> 18:31.980
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
HE TRUSTED.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.897
MELAINA, ARE YOU
A TEA DRINKER?

18:37.203 --> 18:38.639
I AM.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.944
[pen clatters]

18:39.988 --> 18:43.513
WE FOUND A TOXIC SUBSTANCE
INSIDE YOUR TEAPOT.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.300
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

18:47.343 --> 18:50.129
EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING,
BUT...

18:50.172 --> 18:52.653
CAN ANYONE CONFIRM THAT YOU
WERE IN BIG SUR LAST NIGHT?

18:52.696 --> 18:53.958
NO.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.657
I RENT A REMOTE CABIN
FOR SOLITUDE.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.007
WOULD YOU CONSENT
TO A FORENSICS EXAM

18:59.050 --> 19:01.140
AND AN EXAMINATION
OF YOUR VEHICLE?

19:02.663 --> 19:05.535
[voice breaking] NO.

19:05.579 --> 19:08.669
I MEAN, GO AHEAD.
DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.990
YOU'RE NOT REAL.

19:26.034 --> 19:28.776
YOU'RE AN HALLUCINATION.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.648
DEPENDS ON YOUR
POINT OF VIEW, I SUPPOSE.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.302
IT'S THE ONLY REALITY
THAT I KNOW.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.479
[lowered voice]
HOW COME I'M STRAPPED DOWN?

19:36.523 --> 19:38.655
'CAUSE YOU ARESTRAPPED DOWN.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.831
YEAH, THEY'RE PUMPING
YOUR STOMACH RIGHT NOW.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.746
LISTEN.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.835
[air hissing] [man] SET SUCTION
AT 125 INTERMITTENT.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.794
CHECK HIS I.V. AND GET ME
AN ELECTROLYTE BAG

19:46.837 --> 19:48.317
JUST IN CASE. [monitor beeping]

19:48.361 --> 19:51.102
WELL, HOW ABOUT THAT?

19:51.146 --> 19:52.843
[air hissing] [man] A LITTLE MORE...

19:52.887 --> 19:55.237
SO...

19:55.281 --> 19:57.283
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

19:59.415 --> 20:02.505
WELL, AT LEAST HOW I IMAGINE
MY DAUGHTER TO BE ALL GROWN UP.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.725
DO I MEET YOUR APPROVAL?

20:06.074 --> 20:07.858
YOU'RE A BIT LIPPY.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.730
[chuckles]

20:09.773 --> 20:12.080
YEAH, I GET THAT FROM YOU.MM-HMM.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.691
YEAH. SORRY.

20:14.735 --> 20:17.520
I'M NOT REALLY CRAZY
ABOUT THAT.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.305
HEY, YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY
TURN OUT

20:19.348 --> 20:20.523
THE WAY I EXPECTED, EITHER.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.917
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

20:23.918 --> 20:25.876
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.704
I'VE BEEN DEAD
FOR TEN YEARS,

20:27.748 --> 20:29.880
AND YOU'RE STILL
STUCK IN NEUTRAL?

20:29.924 --> 20:32.231
YOU HAVE NO LIFE,
JUST THIS ENDLESS OBSESSION.

20:32.274 --> 20:35.277
RED JOHN. RED JOHN.
[scoffs]

20:35.321 --> 20:36.887
MOM WOULD NOT BE HAPPY.

20:36.931 --> 20:41.240
WELL, MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR MOTHER IS, UH...

20:41.283 --> 20:43.894
IT'S MY BUSINESS.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.766
SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.551
[scoffs] HELLO, I'M A FIGMENT
OF YOUR IMAGINATION.

20:48.595 --> 20:49.944
SHOW YOURSELF SOME RESPECT.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.728
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN
MISSING OUT ON

20:51.772 --> 20:53.382
FOR ALL THESE YEARS?

20:53.426 --> 20:55.036
WHEN DO YOU GO
TO COLLEGE AGAIN?

20:55.079 --> 20:56.907
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU CAN'T EVEN BE REAL

20:56.951 --> 20:59.954
WITH SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.435
DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHO YOU ARE?

21:02.478 --> 21:03.958
[monitor beeping] YES.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.265
WHO?

21:07.962 --> 21:10.094
WELL, COME ON. WHO?

21:10.138 --> 21:13.750
[breathes deeply]

21:13.794 --> 21:15.578
LISBON.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.711
[swallows and sighs]

21:17.754 --> 21:18.973

21:23.499 --> 21:24.935
LISBON.

21:24.979 --> 21:25.980
HEY.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.852
HEY, JANE.

21:28.896 --> 21:31.072
HEY, I'M BACK.YEAH.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.292
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.859
THEY PUMPED YOUR STOMACH.
YOU TOOK SOME KIND OF--

21:35.903 --> 21:37.034
HALLUCINOGEN.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.168
HALLUCINOGEN.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.083
MM.

21:42.126 --> 21:43.954
WAS IT IN THE TEA?

21:43.998 --> 21:45.956
BELLADONNA LEAVES.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.306
HMM.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.046
THE DOCTOR SAYS IT COULD
TAKE A FEW HOURS

21:49.090 --> 21:50.961
TO LEAVE YOUR SYSTEM.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.703
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, THOUGH.
YOU JUST NEED SOME REST.

21:53.747 --> 21:57.228
YEAH.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.275
HOW YOU FEELING?[exhales]

22:00.319 --> 22:03.104
PARCHED. REALLY...

22:04.235 --> 22:06.281
SO THIRSTY.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.110
CAN YOU GET ME
A LITTLE WATER?

22:09.153 --> 22:11.808
PLEASE, BELLADONNA?

22:11.852 --> 22:13.244
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.029
OKAY. BYE-BYE.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.860
[woman over P.A.]
PAGING DR. STATHAM.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.992
DR. STATHAM, PLEASE.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.134
[monitor beeping rapidly]

22:33.177 --> 22:35.310
AH, JANE.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.455
GREAT PARK.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.343
[sighs]

23:09.562 --> 23:11.607
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.522
YOU'RE STILL TRIPPING.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.700
IT WOULD SEEM SO.

23:17.744 --> 23:20.050
YOUR REALLY SHOULDN'T BE
DRIVING.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.879
AND YOU ESPECIALLY SHOULD NOT
BE DRIVING AN AMBULANCE.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.928
OH, THAT'S SOME
STRONG TEA.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.670
[chuckles]

23:30.713 --> 23:31.714
UH-OH.

23:33.716 --> 23:36.066
NOW YOU'RE STEALING
AN AMBULANCE?

23:36.110 --> 23:39.374
NO. NO, I'M JUST
ADMIRING THE INTERIOR.

23:41.115 --> 23:44.248
WICKED G.P.S.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.163
HOW MUCH YOU THINK ONE OF
THESE RIGS GOES FOR?

23:46.207 --> 23:47.556
YOU NEED BED REST.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.429
I NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE CRIME SCENE.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.301
WHAT'S HER STORY?
SHE HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

23:53.344 --> 23:54.868
BE QUIET.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.217
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.046
I WAS TALKING TO
THE HALLUCINATION.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.526
IN BED NOW.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.092
WHEN I WAS IN THE VICTIM'S
KITCHEN,

24:02.136 --> 24:03.920
I MADE A BREAKTHROUGH
IN THE CASE.

24:03.964 --> 24:06.880
AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.404
THAT'S ABOUT WHEN
THE WACKY TEA KICKED IN.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.493
FINE. I WILL HAVE VAN PELT

24:11.537 --> 24:13.756
COME DOWN HERE
WITH CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.541
NOT THE SAME.
I HAVE TO BE THERE.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.804
HALLUCINATIONS ARE PART OF
THE SUBCONSCIOUS.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.109
MINE COULD BE CLUES.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.546
WE'LL GO WHEN YOU'RE LUCID.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.765
WELL, WHEN I'M LUCID,
I COULD FORGET EVERYTHING.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.115
BUT RIGHT NOW,
LET ME TELL YOU--

24:25.159 --> 24:29.250
RIGHT NOW MY VISIONS
ARE VERY, VERY REAL!

24:29.293 --> 24:32.079
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WANT TO
USE DRUGS TO SOLVE A CASE.

24:32.122 --> 24:35.517
SOME GREAT MINDS DID THEIR
BEST WORK ON HALLUCINOGENS.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.564
AND NOW YOU HAVE
A GREAT MIND?OHH! I LIKE HER.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.044
OH, YEAH, FUNNY.
DOUBLE ACT, HUH?

24:41.088 --> 24:43.394
JANE. YOU'RE SCARING ME.

24:43.438 --> 24:46.833
TERESA, YOU CAN
CALL ME PATRICK.

24:48.008 --> 24:50.140
DRUGS IS NOT THE PATH
I WOULD CHOOSE,

24:50.184 --> 24:53.056
BUT IT'S BEEN CHOSEN FOR ME,
SO I MUST STAY THE COURSE.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.884
PLEASE, I IMPLORE YOU,

24:54.928 --> 24:57.452
TAKE ME BACK
TO THE CRIME SCENE.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.762
THE MAHARAJA OF JODHPUR
OWNS THE BLUE ORCHID.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.546
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
CALLED PERSONALLY

25:04.590 --> 25:06.548
TO INQUIRE ABOUT MY SERVICES.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.550
THE COMMISSION WAS MINE--

25:08.594 --> 25:10.900
UNTIL VIKTOR MENDELSSOHN USED
HIS FLASHY CREDENTIALS

25:10.944 --> 25:13.076
TO STEAL MY JOB.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.383
I WAS TOLD
YOU THREATENED VIKTOR.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.385
I DID.DID YOU KILL HIM, TOO?

25:17.428 --> 25:20.344
[speaks foreign language]

25:20.388 --> 25:21.650
COME AGAIN?

25:21.694 --> 25:24.566
IT MEANS BARKING DOGS
SELDOM BITE.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.525
IF I INTENDED TO KILL VIKTOR,

25:26.568 --> 25:28.962
I WOULDN'T BROADCAST
MY INTENTIONS.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.833
WELL, THINGS HAPPEN
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.748
THINGS WE CAN'T CONTROL.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.097
RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED,

25:34.141 --> 25:35.577
VIKTOR WAS OVERHEARD
IN HIS HOUSE

25:35.621 --> 25:37.274
ARGUING WITH A MAN
ABOUT THE BLUE ORCHID.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.972
WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT WASN'T ME.

25:39.015 --> 25:41.540
BUT YOU'RE A BARKING DOG,
FAHAD.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.454
YOU JUST SAID SO YOURSELF.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.195
WERE YOU BARKING
AT VICTOR LAST NIGHT?

25:45.239 --> 25:47.284
WHAT DID YOU WANT FROM ME?

25:47.328 --> 25:49.373
DO YOU WANT TO ARREST ME?
THEN ARREST ME!

25:49.417 --> 25:50.940
IF NOT,
I'M GOING BACK TO WORK!

25:50.984 --> 25:52.551
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY
TO THAT?!

25:52.594 --> 25:54.683
YOU'RE A PERSON OF INTEREST,
FAHAD.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.816
DON'T LEAVE TOWN WITHOUT
NOTIFYING CBI.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.388
DID THAT SOUND LIKE THE MAN
YOU HEARD YELLING LAST NIGHT?

26:04.432 --> 26:05.955
IT MIGHT.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.609
NO, HE DIDN'T SOUND--

26:07.653 --> 26:09.393
I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS HIM.

26:09.437 --> 26:13.049
THE MAN I HEARD YELLING
DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCENT LIKE THAT.

26:15.661 --> 26:16.792
[clicks]

26:17.967 --> 26:19.665
LAST THING I REMEMBER

26:19.708 --> 26:22.232
WAS ADMIRING THIS
BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.625
RIGHT HERE.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.453
REAL OR IMAGINED?

26:25.496 --> 26:27.629
REAL, I THINK.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.283
THEN I HEARD A BANG

26:29.326 --> 26:32.765
IN THAT POT THERE
ON THE STOVE.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.854
WHAT WAS IN THE POT?

26:36.116 --> 26:38.205
A RABBIT.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.598
[chuckles]

26:39.641 --> 26:42.601
[lid closes]LIKE THAT RABBIT?

26:44.080 --> 26:47.257
YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT,

26:47.301 --> 26:50.391
BUT MY RABBIT WAS REAL,
WITH A DIAMOND NECKLACE.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.001
THAT IS SOME HALLUCINOGEN.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.742
SHE'S KIND OF CUTE.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.091
I MEAN,
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER...

26:55.135 --> 26:56.266
YOU BE QUIET.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.269
PRESSING ON,

26:59.313 --> 27:02.229
I CARRIED THE RABBIT
TO THE FOYER...

27:03.360 --> 27:05.145
AND IT JUMPED FROM MY HANDS

27:05.188 --> 27:07.495
AND HOPPED OUT THE DOOR.

27:07.538 --> 27:10.672
THEN I MOVED DOWN THE WALKWAY
LOOKING.

27:10.716 --> 27:14.154
"WHERE'S THE BUNNY?
HERE, LITTLE BUNNY, BUNNY."

27:14.197 --> 27:18.549
AND I WENT THROUGH
THE GAWKING NEIGHBORS'

27:18.593 --> 27:20.900
AND ACROSS THE STREET.

27:22.510 --> 27:26.166
RIGHT HERE I MET THIS
LOVELY SCANDINAVIAN COUPLE

27:26.209 --> 27:29.691
THAT SPOTTED THE RABBIT
HOPPING UP THAT PATH.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.432
THEY WERE SCANDINAVIAN?

27:31.475 --> 27:32.520
YES.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.522
IT'S A CLUE, RIGHT?

27:34.565 --> 27:37.699
SCANDINAVIA. REINDEER.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.136
REINDEER, CHRISTMAS.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.790
I MIGHT HAVE JUST
FIGURED OUT

27:41.834 --> 27:43.313
THAT THE KILLER HAS
A DECEMBER BIRTHDAY.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.401
HMM.

27:47.535 --> 27:48.841
[sighs]

27:48.884 --> 27:51.539
DID THE COUPLE YOU MET
KINDA LOOK LIKE THEM?

27:55.717 --> 27:58.764
YOU MUST HAVE WALKED BY THEM
ON YOUR WAY TO THE BACKYARD.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.766
[giggles] CLASSIC.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.985
STILL WAITING FOR
THE SUBCONSCIOUS CLUES

28:03.029 --> 28:04.334
TO KICK IN, JANE.

28:04.378 --> 28:07.207
THEY WILL. FOLLOW ME.

28:15.998 --> 28:18.348
[door creaks]

28:18.392 --> 28:19.741
THIS IS WRONG.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.047
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:22.048 --> 28:23.919
THIS YARD'S DIFFERENT.

28:23.963 --> 28:27.706
IN MY HALLUCINATION,
THIS WAS A...

28:27.749 --> 28:30.056
MANICURED GARDEN
WITH A...

28:30.099 --> 28:32.101
LOOK AT THAT POOL!THING AND A...

28:32.145 --> 28:33.668
THIS--

28:33.712 --> 28:36.192
OKAY, SO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
BACK HERE IN YOUR VISION.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.933
THE WATER'S GREAT.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.195
IT'S WHERE I MET CHARLOTTE.

28:39.239 --> 28:40.370
CHARLOTTE?

28:40.414 --> 28:42.155
MY DAUGHTER.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.723
IS THAT WHO YOU'VE
BEEN TALKING TO?

28:44.766 --> 28:45.941
YES.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.464
SHE HERE RIGHT NOW?

28:47.508 --> 28:49.423
YEAH.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.949
WH-WHAT IS SHE DOING?

28:55.081 --> 28:56.909
SHE'S DOING THE BACKSTROKE.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.738
I TAUGHT HER THAT.

29:01.435 --> 29:04.220
JANE, MAYBE YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS

29:04.264 --> 29:07.354
DIDN'T SEND YOU ANY CLUES
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

29:07.397 --> 29:09.922
MAYBE IT SENT YOU
YOUR DAUGHTER.

29:10.966 --> 29:13.534
WHY?I DON'T KNOW.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.405
CAN WE GO BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL NOW?

29:15.449 --> 29:16.842
WORKSHOP.WHAT?

29:16.885 --> 29:18.887
CHARLOTTE TOOK ME TO
THE DIAMOND CUTTER'S WORKSHOP.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.671
LAST STOP, I PROMISE.

29:20.715 --> 29:23.065
IF WE DON'T FIND ANYTHING,
I WILL TUCK MYSELF INTO BED

29:23.109 --> 29:24.240
AND SLEEP IT OFF.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.199
I'M GONNA HOLD YOU TO THAT.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.392
[Rigsby] HEY.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.438
[clears throat]

29:48.482 --> 29:51.093
[lock clicks]

29:51.137 --> 29:52.660
YOU HAVE THE KEY?

29:52.703 --> 29:54.618
YEAH, MENDELSSOHN'S
DAUGHTER GAVE IT TO ME.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.099
SHE SAID HER FATHER'S
WORKSHOP WAS, UH,

29:57.143 --> 29:58.797
IN THE BACK HERE.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.851
AND WHO ARE YOU?

30:09.895 --> 30:13.115
CBI. WE'RE INVESTIGATING
VIKTOR MENDELSSOHN'S MURDER.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.464
YOU'RE HIS ASSISTANT?

30:14.508 --> 30:16.597
JULIAN GALLEGO.
UH, I WORK HERE.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.295
IT'S NOT WHAT I IMAGINED.

30:19.339 --> 30:20.906
YOU MIND IF WE TAKE
A LOOK AROUND?

30:20.949 --> 30:23.082
NOT AT ALL. I'M JUST
PACKING UP. PLEASE.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.387
THANK YOU.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.531
I LIKE THE OTHER
WORKSHOP BETTER.SHH.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.448
[whispers] THIS IS SO DULL.

30:41.491 --> 30:44.407
WHY DO EVEN WORK
FOR THE CBI, ANYWAY?

30:44.451 --> 30:46.627
[lowered voice]
YOU KNOW WHY.

30:46.670 --> 30:47.976
TO CATCH RED JOHN.

30:48.020 --> 30:51.719
[scoffs] OKAY. WHATEVER.

30:54.548 --> 30:57.246
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
"OKAY, WHATEVER"?

30:58.334 --> 31:00.467
[sighs] WELL,
TO BE HONEST, DAD,

31:00.510 --> 31:02.469
YOUR OBSESSION'S A LITTLE
CREEPY AND WEIRD, YOU KNOW?

31:03.731 --> 31:05.124
WHAT?

31:05.167 --> 31:08.649
I DO IT ALL FOR YOU.
AND YOUR MOM.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.564
YEAH.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.958
AND I HATE TO BE THE ONE
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU, DAD,

31:13.001 --> 31:14.655
BUT...

31:14.698 --> 31:16.700
THERE'S NOTHING THAT
YOU CAN DO FOR US.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.010
WE DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT HAPPENS TO RED JOHN.

31:22.054 --> 31:24.360
I MEAN, WE'RE DEAD.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.666
GONE.

31:25.709 --> 31:28.712
AND YOU NEED TO START
DEALING WITH THAT.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.629
I DEAL WITH THAT EVERY DAY.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.936
MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.682
COULD YOU PLEASE MOVE?

31:43.336 --> 31:45.729
DON'T ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.647
UH, YOU DON'T NEED
TO GO IN THERE.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.301
THAT'S, UH, JUST MY STUFF.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.580
YOU FOUND IT.
YOU FOUND THE BLUE ORCHID.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.495
YES.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.932
IN YOUR STUFF.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.326
WHAT'S A $20 MILLION
MISSING DIAMOND

32:17.370 --> 32:19.154
DOING IN YOUR BAG?

32:19.198 --> 32:21.852
VIKTOR'S DAUGHTER SAID HE KEPT
IT ON HIS BODY AT ALL TIMES.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.551
I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT GOT IN THERE.

32:24.594 --> 32:25.944
WAIT, YOU'RE NOT ACCUSING ME?

32:28.207 --> 32:30.557
VIKTOR'S NEIGHBOR SAID
SHE HEARD A MAN

32:30.600 --> 32:33.864
ARGUING WITH VIKTOR LAST NIGHT
ABOUT A DIAMOND.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.388
WAS THAT MAN YOU, JULIAN?

32:35.431 --> 32:37.303
NO.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.914
I MEAN... [sighs]
OKAY, YES.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.090
UM, I WAS THERE.SO YOU LIED
TO AGENT VAN PELT?

32:42.134 --> 32:43.613
NO. SHE NEVER
DIRECTLY ASKED ME

32:43.657 --> 32:45.398
IF I WAS AT VIKTOR'S HOUSE
LAST NIGHT.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.182
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER.HOW WOULD THAT HAVE SOUNDED?

32:47.226 --> 32:49.097
THAT YOU FOUGHT WITH
YOUR BOSS, DRUGGED HIM,

32:49.141 --> 32:51.186
STOLE HIS CLIENT'S DIAMONDS,
AND THEN KILLED HIM.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.884
[breathing nervously]
WE HAD A CREATIVE ARGUMENT

32:53.928 --> 32:56.104
OVER HOW TO SHAPE THIS STONE.
WE'RE BOTH ARTISTS, PASSIONATE.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.280
I DIDN'T KILL VIKTOR.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.760
I IDOLIZED HIM.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.283
TURN AROUND AND PUT
YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.111
WHAT?DO IT.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.678
HEY!

33:04.721 --> 33:07.463
[grunting]

33:07.507 --> 33:09.335
WELL, THAT CERTAINLY
WAS EASY.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.990
YEAH, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE I FOUND THE DIAMOND.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.818
[chuckles] YOU WISH.[chuckles]

33:14.862 --> 33:17.647
[breathes deeply]
ALL RIGHTY THEN.

33:17.691 --> 33:19.171
IT'S BEEN REAL.

33:19.214 --> 33:21.347
HANG ON. WHERE--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

33:21.390 --> 33:23.044
HELLO, I'M PRACTICALLY
A GROWN WOMAN.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.654
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU
WHERE I'M GOING.

33:24.698 --> 33:29.050
NO, YEAH, I--
I-I KNOW, BUT...

33:29.094 --> 33:31.096
YOU'RE COMING BACK.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.230
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

33:37.189 --> 33:39.756
[Lisbon] HEY, JANE?NO, NOT NOW.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.152
WAIT.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.039
JULIAN'S IN HOLDING.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.823
THE D.A. LIKES HIM FOR THE CASE.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.868
IS CHARLOTTE...

34:04.912 --> 34:07.610
GONE. TEA WORE OFF.

34:07.654 --> 34:10.178
OH. WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.528
YOUR HALLUCINATION LED US
TO THE KILLER.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.791
NO, MY IMAGINARY DAUGHTER
WAS RIGHT.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.793
IT'S ALL TOO EASY.

34:16.837 --> 34:18.926
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:18.969 --> 34:21.102
WELL, I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO THAT WORKSHOP.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.625
I'VE NEVER EVEN MET
THE APPRENTICE.

34:22.669 --> 34:25.411
HOW WOULD I KNOW HE WAS
STASHING STOLEN GOODS THERE?

34:25.454 --> 34:27.108
WHO CARES?
YOU FOUND THE ROCK.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.849
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE FOUND THE KILLER.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.155
WE'VE GOT A MATCH FOR
THE SECOND SET OF PRINTS

34:30.198 --> 34:32.809
ON THE MURDER WEAPON.
THEY BELONG TO JULIAN.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.985
MEH, YOU COPPERS
AND YOUR EVIDENCE.

34:35.029 --> 34:36.726
YOU ALWAYS LET IT
CONFUSE EVERYTHING.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.686
OF COURSE JULIAN'S PRINTS
ARE GONNA BE ON HIS BOSS' TOOLS.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.688
THEY WERE MASTER
AND APPRENTICE, RIGHT?

34:41.731 --> 34:43.559
YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS?

34:43.603 --> 34:46.780
YES. THERE'S SOMETHING
I AM NOT SEEING.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.088
RIGSBY,
WHERE'S THAT NECKLACE?

34:50.131 --> 34:51.654
WHAT NECKLACE?

34:51.698 --> 34:55.136
THE ONE I HANDED YOU FROM
THE MAID THAT FOUND THE BODY.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.137
THE GARDENER FOUND THE BODY.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.574
WELL... [chuckles]

34:58.618 --> 35:00.402
MEANS I HALLUCINATED
THE MAID.

35:00.446 --> 35:01.969
WHY?

35:02.012 --> 35:04.493
SEND MYSELF A MESSAGE.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.495
AN EAGLE CLAW NECKLACE.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.802
WHAT ARE EAGLES?
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.717
THEY'RE HUNTERS IN THE SKY

35:10.760 --> 35:12.893
WITH EXCELLENT VISION.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.856
JUST AFTER I...
POURED THE TEA,

35:19.900 --> 35:22.424
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH
THE KITCHEN WINDOW,

35:22.468 --> 35:24.165
WATCHING A BUTTERFLY,

35:24.209 --> 35:26.602
AND I SAW THE BEDROOM

35:26.646 --> 35:29.779
OF THAT, UH, NEIGHBOR LADY--
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

35:29.823 --> 35:31.477
BETTY.BETTY. YES.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.174
HER BEDROOM WAS ON
THE SECOND FLOOR,

35:33.218 --> 35:36.003
UP HIGH,
WITH AN EAGLE'S VIEW.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.222
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS HER BEDROOM?

35:37.265 --> 35:39.702
SHE HAD LACE CURTAINS
AND BLACKOUT SHADES.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.443
BETTY TOLD ME
SHE COULDN'T SEE THE KITCHEN

35:41.487 --> 35:42.618
FROM HER BEDROOM WINDOW.

35:42.662 --> 35:45.143
SHE LIED.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.890
OKAY. PLAY IT COOL.OKAY.

35:57.546 --> 35:58.591
HI!OOH.

35:58.634 --> 36:02.072
HOW'S THE, UH,
INVESTIGATION GOING?

36:03.552 --> 36:05.902
WELL, TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, UH,

36:05.946 --> 36:07.730
WE'RE A LITTLE STUCK.

36:07.774 --> 36:11.299
OH. WELL, IF I CAN BE
OF ANY MORE HELP...

36:11.343 --> 36:13.562
THERE'S AN IDEA.

36:13.606 --> 36:16.435
OH, UH, UH, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO COME INSIDE?

36:16.478 --> 36:18.263
ONLY IF THERE'S
A CUP OF TEA INVOLVED.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.221
I'D LOVE A CUP OF TEA.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.614
[laughs] SURE. COME ON.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.659
COME ON.OH, FANTASTIC.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.316
WE'RE CLOSING IN
ON VIKTOR'S KILLER,

36:28.360 --> 36:29.491
BUT BEFORE WE MAKE
AN ARREST,

36:29.535 --> 36:31.624
WE NEED TO FIND
HIS CLIENT'S DIAMONDS.

36:31.667 --> 36:32.799
[gasps] THE BLUE ORCHID.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.844
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
THE NEWS ALL DAY.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.498
OH, NO, W-WE FOUND THAT.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.718
THE--THE BLUE ORCHID
WAS HIDDEN IN THE, UH, BAG

36:38.761 --> 36:39.936
OF VIKTOR'S APPRENTICE.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.329
OH, SO YOU HAVE
YOUR KILLER?

36:41.373 --> 36:43.026
NO. WE DON'T THINK SO.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.245
[teapot whistling]OH.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.943
[Patrick]
UH, RELAX, I'LL FIX THE TEA.

36:46.987 --> 36:50.338
ONLY A FOOLISH KILLER
WOULD KEEP THE BLUE ORCHID.

36:50.382 --> 36:53.254
IT'S HARD TO MOVE SUCH
A HIGH-PROFILE PIECE QUIETLY.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.864
OH, I SEE.[whistling diminishes]

36:54.908 --> 36:57.258
A SMART KILLER WOULD USE
THE BLUE ORCHID

36:57.302 --> 36:59.347
TO FRAME AN INNOCENT MAN
FOR MURDER

36:59.391 --> 37:01.219
AND KEEP THE SMALL DIAMONDS.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.263
THEY'RE EASIER TO FENCE,

37:02.307 --> 37:03.917
BUT STILL WORTH
A COUPLE MILLION.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.485
DOES ANYONE WANT, UH,
LEMON WITH THEIR TEA?

37:08.051 --> 37:10.010
LET ME TOP THAT UP
FOR YOU.OH.

37:10.053 --> 37:13.405
THERE'S--THERE'S JUST
ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:13.448 --> 37:16.843
WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE
THAT JULIAN KILLED VIKTOR?

37:16.886 --> 37:18.845
DOESN'T THAT MAKE MORE SENSE,

37:18.888 --> 37:21.761
IT'S MORE PLAUSIBLE,
THAN SOMEBODY FRAMING JULIAN?

37:21.804 --> 37:23.632
FRAMING HIM
WAS THE EASY PART.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.852
AFTER VIKTOR WAS DEAD,
ALL THE KILLER HAD TO DO

37:25.895 --> 37:27.767
WAS TAKE HIS KEYS,
DRIVE TO HIS WORKSHOP,

37:27.810 --> 37:31.031
AND PLANT THE BLUE ORCHID
IN JULIAN'S BAG.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.946
WELL, IF THAT WAS
THE EASY PART,

37:32.989 --> 37:34.774
WHAT WAS THE HARD PART?

37:34.817 --> 37:37.080
UH, GUTTING VIKTOR
LIKE A FISH.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.734
OH, DEAR.

37:38.778 --> 37:39.735
OH!

37:39.779 --> 37:41.215
WHAT'S WRONG?OH, MY GOODNESS!

37:41.259 --> 37:44.566
SOMETHING IS TICKLING
MY TOE--OH, THERE IT--

37:44.610 --> 37:46.438
WHERE DID--OH!

37:46.481 --> 37:49.136
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

37:49.179 --> 37:51.399
UH, WHERE DID WHAT
COME FROM?

37:51.443 --> 37:54.054
THE RABBIT.WHAT RABBIT?

37:54.097 --> 37:55.055
I HAVE NO IDEA.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.100
THE--THE RABBIT!

37:57.144 --> 37:59.189
THERE'S A RABBIT
RIGHT HERE IN MY HOUSE!

37:59.233 --> 38:00.800
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

38:00.843 --> 38:02.497
[speaking Scandinavian
language]

38:02.541 --> 38:04.325
[both speaking
Scandinavian language]

38:04.369 --> 38:06.545
[speaking Scandinavian
language] RABBIT!

38:06.588 --> 38:08.329
BUNNY RABBIT, OHH.[speaking Scandinavian
language] RABBIT.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.810
[makes chewing sounds]
AH-HA!

38:10.853 --> 38:11.985
CARROT. MMM.[laughs]

38:12.028 --> 38:13.943
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

38:13.987 --> 38:15.597
WHY ARE--

38:15.641 --> 38:17.686
OH, NO.
OH, MY LORD.

38:17.730 --> 38:19.775
[speaking
Scandinavian language]WHICH--WHICH TEA
DID YOU SERVE ME?

38:19.819 --> 38:20.950
JA. JA.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.125
OH, LORD. OH, LORD.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.779
OH, LORD.
OH, MY GOD.

38:23.823 --> 38:24.954
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO!

38:24.998 --> 38:26.129
NO, NO, NO.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.567
I WILL NOT ANSWER
YOUR QUESTIONS.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.133
[speaking indistinctly][cackling]

38:30.177 --> 38:32.353
I WILL NOT TELL YOU
WHAT YOU WANNA KNOW.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.485
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.138
NO. NO, PLEASE.
LET ME GO.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.923
LET ME GO!WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

38:36.966 --> 38:39.012
NO! NO, I NEED HELP!

38:39.055 --> 38:40.013
PLEASE!IS THAT YOUR SHOULDER POUCH?

38:40.056 --> 38:41.144
NO, I NEED MEDICAL HELP!

38:41.188 --> 38:42.885
PLEASE! I JUST DRANK
SOME BELLADONNA!

38:42.929 --> 38:44.670
I NEED HELP![normal voice] YOU DRANK
RASPBERRY HIBISCUS.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.759
SWEET LIKE BELLADONNA,
IT DOESN'T PACK THE PUNCH.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.108
BELIEVE ME.

38:48.151 --> 38:50.980
BUT THE--BUT THE--
THE--THE RABBIT...

38:51.024 --> 38:54.114
LOCAL PET STORE.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.638
YOU TRICKED ME.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.858
JA, JA. AH!

38:58.901 --> 39:00.294
[speaks gibberish]

39:00.338 --> 39:02.992
COME ON. LET'S GO.YOU TRICKED ME.

39:06.474 --> 39:09.259
YOUR FINANCES
ARE A MESS, BETTY.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.349
THE MONEY FROM YOUR LATE
HUSBAND'S INSURANCE POLICY--

39:11.392 --> 39:12.480
LONG GONE.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.264
YOU COULDN'T MAKE
NEXT MONTH'S RENT.

39:14.308 --> 39:15.614
$2 MILLION IN STOLEN DIAMONDS

39:15.657 --> 39:17.659
WOULD HAVE KEPT YOU LIVING
IN STYLE FOR A LONG TIME.

39:17.703 --> 39:20.227
WHAT WAS HE THINKING?

39:20.270 --> 39:23.926
AN OLD MAN WALKING AROUND
WITH ALL THOSE JEWELS?

39:23.970 --> 39:26.451
HE WAS BEGGING FOR IT.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.322
HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE CARRIED THEM ON HIM?

39:28.366 --> 39:29.976
OH, PLEASE,
I'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS.

39:30.019 --> 39:32.848
HIS--HIS--HIS KITCHEN WINDOW'S
RIGHT ACROSS FROM MY BEDROOM.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.329
EVERY NIGHT I WOULD
LIE IN BED THINKING,

39:35.373 --> 39:38.811
"HOW CAN I GET
MY HANDS ON THAT POUCH?"

39:38.854 --> 39:40.595
THE BLUE ORCHID
WAS YOUR SHOT?

39:40.639 --> 39:42.510
OH, FRAMING JULIAN
WAS ONE OF, LIKE,

39:42.554 --> 39:44.773
A DOZEN PLANS
I'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.296
THE DAUGHTER
WAS AT THE CABIN,

39:46.340 --> 39:47.950
AND WHEN I SAW THE TWO OF THEM

39:47.994 --> 39:49.517
IN THE KITCHEN
WITH THAT BIG ROCK,

39:49.561 --> 39:51.824
I KNEW IT WAS NOW OR NEVER.

39:51.867 --> 39:56.306
ONCE JULIAN LEFT,
I JUST--I WENT ON AUTOPILOT.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.483
[chuckles]WHERE'D YOU GET
THE BELLADONNA?

39:58.526 --> 40:01.050
I'VE HAD IT FOR MONTHS
FOR JUST SUCH AN OCCASION.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.835
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS DROP IN

40:02.878 --> 40:05.185
AND OFFER HIM A POT OF TEA.
[laughs]

40:05.228 --> 40:08.057
THE HALLUCINATIONS
MADE IT EASIER TO KILL HIM?

40:08.101 --> 40:09.929
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN.

40:09.972 --> 40:12.932
BUT ONCE I LIFTED
THE DIAMONDS OFF VIKTOR,

40:12.975 --> 40:15.804
IT... IT--IT WAS
THE CRAZIEST THING.

40:15.848 --> 40:18.285
HE BECAME SO DELUSIONAL,

40:18.328 --> 40:21.462
I CONVINCED HIM
TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

40:21.506 --> 40:24.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HOW?

40:24.944 --> 40:30.558
I TOLD VIKTOR THAT THE DIAMONDS
WERE TRAPPED IN HIS STOMACH.

40:30.602 --> 40:35.302
[giggling]

40:58.804 --> 41:00.458
[clatters]

42:25.455 --> 42:28.371
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
