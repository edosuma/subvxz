00:16.757 --> 00:18.644
- Sandra?
- Hey.

00:20.295 --> 00:22.873
- What?
- Jay, get in here.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.063
Al? What's going on?

00:25.066 --> 00:26.344
Hold her while I rip off her face.

00:26.368 --> 00:28.019
- My God.
- Trust me.

00:28.043 --> 00:29.947
"Impossible" rubber-face thing.

00:29.971 --> 00:31.372
That's not Sandra.

00:31.396 --> 00:33.100
That's Kate Littlejohn.

00:33.124 --> 00:34.468
They worked on a case together.

00:34.492 --> 00:37.404
Sandra was in her office.
Now Kate is here.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.806
- Yep, okay. How do we do this?
- Whoa!

00:39.830 --> 00:41.408
Bullpen. Five minutes!

00:41.432 --> 00:43.243
- You got lucky.
- You guys are insane.

00:43.267 --> 00:45.601
I want to clean my office. So what?

00:45.625 --> 00:48.448
It happens.
It has nothing to do with Kate.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.574
I do not want to know.

01:02.598 --> 01:05.444
Leak in my apartment at 400
in the morning, in my bedroom.

01:05.470 --> 01:08.649
It was raining on my bed.

01:08.673 --> 01:10.351
- Cold water.
- What's going on?

01:10.375 --> 01:13.154
Leak in my apartment at 400
in the morning, in my bedroom.

01:13.178 --> 01:14.489
- It was raining...
- Can we just...

01:14.513 --> 01:15.723
Why don't you stay with Serena?

01:15.747 --> 01:17.792
We went on one date.
I'm gonna move in with her now?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.494
Seems like the kind of thing
you would do.

01:19.518 --> 01:21.383
I guess I could ask her if there's...

01:21.407 --> 01:22.630
No. God, no.

01:22.654 --> 01:24.847
- How long are you out?
- Landlord said a week.

01:24.871 --> 01:26.236
So stay with Kate.

01:29.747 --> 01:31.358
- No. Never.
- Never?

01:31.382 --> 01:33.427
Never.

01:33.451 --> 01:34.662
- Never?
- Nope.

01:34.948 --> 01:36.292
Never lived away from my parents.

01:36.316 --> 01:37.660
I did have a sleepover

01:37.684 --> 01:40.029
with Tristan Kustal once when I was 11.

01:40.053 --> 01:41.931
We played this game called Aunt Patrol.

01:41.955 --> 01:44.233
I thought it was like ants,
but it was aunt.

01:44.257 --> 01:45.267
You know, with a "U."

01:45.291 --> 01:47.002
We'd follow his aunt around.

01:47.026 --> 01:48.237
Kind of weird.

01:48.261 --> 01:50.106
Pretty much stayed at home after that.

01:50.130 --> 01:52.808
Well, I think it's good
to have a roommate.

01:53.431 --> 01:55.209
You really get to know the person,

01:55.233 --> 01:56.911
and then you can tell when
they've been taken over

01:56.935 --> 01:58.312
by another person.

01:58.336 --> 01:59.880
I'll just stay with my folks.

01:59.904 --> 02:01.382
This is heartbreaking.

02:01.406 --> 02:02.650
I-It's really fine.

02:02.674 --> 02:04.952
No, this letter from a girl
in juvenile detention.

02:04.976 --> 02:07.822
She's 12 years old
and serving four years.

02:07.846 --> 02:09.830
- Emma.
- Yeah. How did you...

02:09.856 --> 02:11.667
She wrote to every lawyer in the office.

02:11.691 --> 02:12.835
Four months ago.

02:12.859 --> 02:14.803
Asking for help on an appeal.

02:14.827 --> 02:17.873
She probably just found our
website and went down the line.

02:17.897 --> 02:19.108
Did anyone reach out to her?

02:19.132 --> 02:20.609
Good morning.

02:20.633 --> 02:22.344
Jay, duty.

02:22.368 --> 02:24.546
Sandra, assault.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.815
Allison, stamps.

02:26.839 --> 02:29.785
Jason, fraud.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.254
Emma?

02:31.278 --> 02:32.255
You got it, too?

02:32.279 --> 02:33.723
I'm sorry. Did you say stamps?

02:33.747 --> 02:35.358
Four Inverted Jennys.

02:35.382 --> 02:37.693
One of the most valuable stamps
in the world.

02:37.717 --> 02:40.396
They were stolen from
the National Philatelic...

02:40.420 --> 02:41.464
Gesundheit.

02:41.488 --> 02:43.299
Foundation 59 years ago.

02:43.323 --> 02:45.301
And then, last week,

02:45.907 --> 02:47.985
Donald Newman sent a picture of them

02:48.009 --> 02:49.487
to Sotheby's to have them appraised.

02:49.511 --> 02:51.856
Shouldn't the statute of
limitations on stolen stamps

02:51.880 --> 02:53.524
be like... 58 years?

02:53.548 --> 02:55.392
They're not trying to
charge him criminally.

02:55.416 --> 02:57.628
It's an in rem proceeding. They
just want the stamps back.

02:57.652 --> 02:59.063
But Donald refused to return them,

02:59.087 --> 03:01.398
so the court assigned him
a public defender.

03:01.422 --> 03:03.467
- Which is you.
- This is heartbreaking.

03:03.491 --> 03:06.270
So I just convince him
to return the stamps?

03:06.294 --> 03:07.972
No problem.

03:07.996 --> 03:10.875
I was the only one who could
ever talk to my grandfather.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.174
I alone convinced him to
wear pants at Thanksgiving.

03:14.199 --> 03:16.311
I'm good with old people.

03:16.335 --> 03:17.367
Go away.

03:19.071 --> 03:21.783
As your attorney, I am telling you...

03:21.807 --> 03:24.552
returning the stamps
is in your best interest.

03:24.576 --> 03:29.151
What kind of legal strategy
is "give back the stamps"?

03:29.515 --> 03:31.293
You're no Matlock, that's for sure.

03:31.317 --> 03:34.929
Okay, well, I have no idea who
Matlock is, but I do know...

03:34.953 --> 03:36.631
You don't know Matlock?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.937
The greatest TV show ever?

03:38.961 --> 03:40.038
Andy Griffith?

03:40.062 --> 03:41.740
How can you call yourself a lawyer?

03:41.764 --> 03:44.743
I guess it's the degree on my wall.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.177
Piece of paper.

03:46.201 --> 03:48.179
Now, if Matlock were here

03:48.490 --> 03:50.301
and we were going to court,
first thing he'd say

03:50.325 --> 03:52.404
is we need to figure out
how to spin our story...

03:52.428 --> 03:54.205
We're not going to court.

03:54.229 --> 03:56.107
Everyone knows you have those stamps.

03:56.131 --> 03:58.576
Sotheby's, the National
Philatelic Foundation,

03:58.600 --> 04:00.779
the FBI...

04:00.803 --> 04:03.782
that is your foot with your shoe,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.121
the same shoe you're wearing right now...

04:06.145 --> 04:07.222
These aren't my shoes.

04:07.246 --> 04:09.591
This is the picture of the stamps

04:09.615 --> 04:12.127
that you e-mailed to the auction house.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.706
And this is your apartment
in the background.

04:14.730 --> 04:16.575
No, that's a look-alike.

04:16.599 --> 04:18.877
That's a hand-made afghan...

04:18.901 --> 04:20.212
I'm... I'm being framed.

04:20.236 --> 04:22.614
The FBI will be coming
to collect those stamps,

04:22.638 --> 04:25.584
and when they do,
you need to turn them over.

04:25.608 --> 04:28.320
All right, fine.
I'll give them the stamps.

04:32.715 --> 04:34.214
Go away.

04:37.053 --> 04:38.263
Okay.

04:52.656 --> 04:53.900
Thanks for coming.

04:53.924 --> 04:55.735
I don't get many visitors.

04:55.759 --> 04:58.071
I'm sorry nobody in my office
wrote you back.

04:58.095 --> 05:00.006
I just figured
they throw away the mail here.

05:00.463 --> 05:02.675
They can't throw away the mail, Emma.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.685
They do it all the time.

05:09.359 --> 05:10.870
Why are you here?

05:10.894 --> 05:13.139
You said something in your
letter about stealing a scooter.

05:13.163 --> 05:15.241
- But that can't be why...
- That is why.

05:15.265 --> 05:16.642
I didn't steal it.

05:16.666 --> 05:18.911
Even if you did. Four years?

05:18.935 --> 05:20.746
What did your lawyer say to the judge?

05:20.770 --> 05:22.715
I didn't have one.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.250
You didn't have a lawyer?

05:24.274 --> 05:26.018
The parole officer told me and my parents

05:26.042 --> 05:27.220
we didn't need one.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.788
He said it would go quicker that way.

05:28.812 --> 05:30.756
That the judge would go easy on me.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.658
And the judge was okay with that?

05:32.988 --> 05:35.355
A bunch of other girls
in here had him, too.

05:36.319 --> 05:37.619
He's the worst.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.190
A-Are you my lawyer, Sandra?

05:43.660 --> 05:46.205
I'm not the right kind of lawyer,

05:46.229 --> 05:48.575
but I will find a lawyer
who can help you,

05:48.599 --> 05:51.566
and I will bug them every day
until they come see you.

05:52.703 --> 05:54.970
I am really good at bugging people.

06:01.011 --> 06:02.811
Who was the judge, Emma?

06:06.950 --> 06:09.495
Mr. Kimball, you're here to enter a plea,

06:09.519 --> 06:11.537
and you've agreed to be
here without a lawyer.

06:11.561 --> 06:12.598
Is that correct?

06:12.622 --> 06:14.133
Yes.

06:14.157 --> 06:16.302
"Yes, Your Honor."

06:16.326 --> 06:17.970
Yes, Your Honor.

06:17.994 --> 06:19.696
I've earned that title.

06:20.363 --> 06:22.408
You've agreed to plead guilty
to 3rd Degree Assault,

06:22.432 --> 06:23.676
is that correct?

06:23.700 --> 06:25.144
Yes, Your Honor.

06:25.168 --> 06:27.446
Is there anything you'd like to
say before I sentence you?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.415
I'm sorry for what I did...

06:29.439 --> 06:32.585
Well, now, if you mean it,
say it like you mean it.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.388
I'm sorry for what I did.

06:35.412 --> 06:37.949
For hitting Stevie Weiss at school.

06:37.974 --> 06:39.708
I didn't mean to hurt him.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.878
Now... Now wait a second, Alex.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.948
You're sorry for what you did,
but you didn't mean to do it?

06:44.972 --> 06:46.285
Did you hit him?

06:46.309 --> 06:47.484
Yes.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.919
And you know hitting hurts people.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.287
Yes.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.911
So you meant to hurt him.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.760
The defendant has pled guilty
and is deemed convicted

06:56.784 --> 07:00.930
as a juvenile offender under
New York Penal Law, Section 120.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.566
I hereby impose a sentence of 12 months,

07:03.590 --> 07:06.636
to be served at the New Roads
Juvenile Detention Center.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.126
We're in recess.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.107
- 12 months.
- Yes.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.575
For punching someone at recess.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.478
And he's basically counseling
these kids not to have counsel.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.148
95% of his convictions
in the last three years

07:18.172 --> 07:19.649
end up at New Roads... a private,

07:19.673 --> 07:21.551
for-profit detention center.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.786
Sandra, what are you asking?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.454
You cannot handle her appeal.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.688
You have clients here

07:25.712 --> 07:27.924
who need your full
and undivided attention...

07:27.948 --> 07:29.559
I think there's something
wrong with this judge.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.594
And if that is true, then it
will help her appeal.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.796
I will find a lawyer for her,

07:32.820 --> 07:33.830
but if I could just investigate...

07:33.854 --> 07:35.131
You're gonna investigate a judge?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.433
Out of this office? No, you are not.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.658
You are not a prosecutor, Sandra.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.861
I am not a prosecutor.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.343
I am not a prosecutor.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.402
I need your help.

07:52.573 --> 07:59.262
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

08:02.599 --> 08:03.943
It's sad.

08:03.967 --> 08:05.545
- It's devastating.
- It is.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.981
But it is not evidence of a crime.

08:08.005 --> 08:10.049
Not yet. But if you open
an investigation...

08:10.073 --> 08:12.485
You want me to open
a federal investigation

08:12.509 --> 08:14.521
into Judge Grant Fitzpatrick?

08:14.545 --> 08:16.723
- Yes.
- Based on what?

08:16.747 --> 08:19.058
- That.
- This is a letter from a girl.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.361
You also have the data there
about how Judge Fitzpatrick

08:21.385 --> 08:23.663
directs these kids to a
for-profit detention center...

08:23.687 --> 08:25.532
Which proves what, exactly?

08:25.556 --> 08:26.788
I don't know yet.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.861
You're saying you need more information.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.696
I am saying this is one of the most

08:31.720 --> 08:33.731
well-respected judges in New York.

08:33.755 --> 08:36.167
I'm saying you have a girl who
received a tough sentence.

08:36.191 --> 08:39.304
I'm saying those things together
are evidence of nothing.

08:39.328 --> 08:40.538
Okay, but you're not saying no.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.573
I am saying no.

08:41.597 --> 08:42.941
It's not a hard no.

08:42.965 --> 08:44.075
It is. No!

08:44.099 --> 08:46.144
No! No!

08:46.168 --> 08:48.320
- Don't take it personally.
- I don't.

08:48.344 --> 08:49.614
Hey, are you going back to your office?

08:49.638 --> 08:50.908
Yes. Why?

08:50.932 --> 08:51.988
This is for your friend.

08:52.012 --> 08:53.518
- I have a lot of friends.
- Do you?

08:53.542 --> 08:54.808
Yes. Why do you say that?

08:55.811 --> 08:58.056
- Yes!
- No.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.223
She said yes?

08:59.247 --> 09:00.792
She seemed interested in the case.

09:00.816 --> 09:02.626
- Really?
- Yeah. Says if we get her a little more,

09:02.650 --> 09:03.661
then it's a go.

09:03.685 --> 09:07.187
Let's find out everything we can
about Judge Grant Fitzpatrick.

09:08.223 --> 09:11.302
Al. This is from Leonard.

09:11.326 --> 09:12.804
Leonard Knox?

09:12.828 --> 09:14.606
Why are you delivering something
from Leonard Knox?

09:14.630 --> 09:17.508
I was in their offices,
talking to someone.

09:17.532 --> 09:20.111
- Kate?
- Doesn't matter.

09:20.135 --> 09:21.479
What is it?

09:21.503 --> 09:23.414
A signed photo, maybe? I don't know.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.016
- Worse than that.
- Worse than that?

09:25.040 --> 09:26.484
- Really?
- Yes.

09:26.508 --> 09:28.261
You told me you were going
to return the stamps.

09:28.285 --> 09:29.988
- What stamps?
- Donald.

09:30.012 --> 09:31.289
No, don't.

09:31.313 --> 09:33.224
Don't do that.

09:33.248 --> 09:36.043
I don't like when people
call me by my first name.

09:36.044 --> 09:37.477
Donald.

09:37.879 --> 09:39.791
- It sounds like trouble.
- It is trouble.

09:39.815 --> 09:42.393
You're in contempt of a court order.

09:42.417 --> 09:43.594
That's why you're here.

09:43.618 --> 09:45.763
Yeah. Well, I knew there
had to be some reason.

09:45.787 --> 09:47.265
Why didn't you hand over the stamps

09:47.289 --> 09:48.399
when they came back to get them?

09:48.423 --> 09:49.801
'Cause I want the money.

09:49.825 --> 09:51.169
They're stolen.

09:51.193 --> 09:52.904
From me.

09:52.928 --> 09:54.906
What are you talking about?

09:54.930 --> 09:57.809
My father bought those Jennys
during the war.

09:57.833 --> 10:01.078
He died in 1952, and he
didn't leave a will.

10:01.102 --> 10:03.414
I wanted to just split
the stamps, you know,

10:03.438 --> 10:06.131
two for me, two for my brother George.

10:06.775 --> 10:10.087
But George took the whole block
and donated it.

10:10.111 --> 10:12.457
To the National Philatelic Foundation.

10:12.481 --> 10:15.226
That's when George and I stopped
speaking to each other.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.129
- That's awful.
- You're telling me.

10:18.153 --> 10:20.698
You know how rich I'd be
if I'd sold those stamps

10:20.722 --> 10:24.469
back in the '50s, like I wanted
to do, invested the money?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.304
Depends on the investment.

10:26.328 --> 10:28.005
Billionaire.

10:28.029 --> 10:29.607
That's how much money I'd have.

10:29.631 --> 10:31.609
So maybe if I contact George...

10:31.633 --> 10:33.678
No, George is not gonna help me.

10:33.702 --> 10:35.168
He hates me.

10:36.304 --> 10:37.348
Also, he's dead.

10:37.372 --> 10:39.350
I'm sorry.

10:39.374 --> 10:40.485
It's not your fault.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.521
Listen, I'm going to get you out of here,

10:43.545 --> 10:46.279
but then we have to get the stamps.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.994
$595?

10:50.018 --> 10:51.195
For one night?

10:51.219 --> 10:53.097
One? One night?

10:53.121 --> 10:55.088
One?! One night?!

10:56.091 --> 10:57.524
Is that a personal call?

10:58.901 --> 11:00.846
- No.
- Just better to be truthful here.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.614
Yes. My apartment flooded.

11:02.638 --> 11:03.882
I was looking for a hotel room.

11:03.906 --> 11:05.501
- You're looking for a place to stay?
- Yes.

11:05.525 --> 11:06.561
Come stay with me.

11:06.585 --> 11:08.019
You live with your parents.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.668
My parents love guests.

11:09.692 --> 11:11.308
Tina's been there. It's great, right?

11:11.340 --> 11:12.813
- You'd stay there.
- Never.

11:15.456 --> 11:17.301
- See?
- I don't want to put you out.

11:17.325 --> 11:18.535
No, it's no trouble at all.

11:18.559 --> 11:20.737
We can take the train in
together from Queens.

11:20.761 --> 11:21.938
It'll be fun.

11:21.962 --> 11:23.640
I've never actually spent
any time in Queens.

11:23.664 --> 11:24.741
You'll love it.

11:24.765 --> 11:26.710
It's got the busiest airspace in the U.S.

11:26.734 --> 11:30.173
and the biggest cemetery, and the Mets.

11:31.005 --> 11:33.383
Yeah. Hey, how's Littlejohn?

11:33.407 --> 11:35.406
- She...
- I'm just kidding. I don't care.

11:40.799 --> 11:42.244
Hey, what are you doing?

11:42.268 --> 11:44.112
Are you doing a magic show?

11:44.136 --> 11:47.349
How much does a family court judge make?

11:47.373 --> 11:50.485
I-I don't know. $200,000 a year?

11:50.509 --> 11:52.612
For real, though,
why are you wearing that?

11:52.679 --> 11:53.856
I was in family court,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.159
where I learned a few things
about Judge Fitzpatrick.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.695
In the last three years,
he has joined a country club,

11:58.719 --> 12:00.196
upgraded his car,

12:00.220 --> 12:03.032
and taken European vacations
with his three kids

12:03.056 --> 12:07.070
who are all in college
with no student loans.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.829
The math doesn't lie.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.831
Fitzpatrick should be
in significant debt,

12:10.855 --> 12:12.266
but he hasn't filed for bankruptcy

12:12.290 --> 12:15.042
or opened any new bank accounts
or credit cards.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.211
Maybe he comes from money.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.479
Son of a Pittsburgh steel worker?

12:17.503 --> 12:19.448
I don't think so.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.783
But his wife, on the other hand,

12:20.807 --> 12:22.651
did inherit a little dough
when her mom died,

12:22.675 --> 12:27.556
which she used to buy
an apartment in Gramercy.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.692
I graduated summa cum laude
from Berkeley.

12:29.716 --> 12:30.793
I don't need a flowchart.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.328
I didn't go to Berkeley.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.596
I like visual aids.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.501
- Who's that?
- Joanne Green.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.736
Got divorced a few years back
and moved into the city,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.706
where she rents
the Fitzpatricks' apartment.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.707
Their renter?

12:44.731 --> 12:46.542
Now you're just drawing things.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.027
This is Roman Cox.
Joanne Green's brother.

12:49.051 --> 12:51.063
You sure? He looks a lot
like that other guy.

12:51.087 --> 12:53.499
Roman is a self-made millionaire.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.801
He owns properties all over the city,

12:55.825 --> 12:58.403
including a majority stake

12:58.820 --> 13:02.515
in New Roads Juvenile Detention Center.

13:03.091 --> 13:05.003
The sister of the guy who owns New Roads

13:05.027 --> 13:07.438
rents Judge Fitzpatrick's apartment?

13:07.462 --> 13:10.008
See? If I didn't have a visual aid,

13:10.032 --> 13:12.143
I couldn't do all of this.

13:13.468 --> 13:15.947
We need to talk to Joanne Green.

13:20.742 --> 13:22.120
What? What are you doing?

13:22.427 --> 13:23.871
I have a feeling...

13:23.895 --> 13:26.373
We can't break into somebody's apartment!

13:26.397 --> 13:27.999
It's not breaking in...

13:29.200 --> 13:30.833
if no one lives here.

13:33.671 --> 13:36.417
It's a money-laundering scheme.

13:36.666 --> 13:38.410
Joanne Green isn't paying Fitzpatrick

13:38.434 --> 13:39.711
to rent this apartment.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.670
She's paying him to send kids
to her brother's prison.

13:45.641 --> 13:48.676
Well, FYI, this is breaking in.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.232
I don't know if this is a good idea.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.392
Dude, it's fine.

13:55.393 --> 13:56.482
I don't even know if my parents are home.

13:56.483 --> 13:57.483
No big deal.

13:57.484 --> 13:59.312
Mom. Dad.

13:59.313 --> 14:00.653
This is Seth.

14:06.273 --> 14:08.562
You are real.

14:08.563 --> 14:11.692
We thought you were another one
of Jay's imaginary friends.

14:11.693 --> 14:13.152
When he was a boy...

14:13.153 --> 14:14.312
Okay.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.062
Seth, this is Vera, Sam.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.562
Please, you can call me Mom.

14:18.563 --> 14:20.442
Thank you so much for having me.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.652
We are so happy you are here.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.812
Now, dinner is ready.

14:22.813 --> 14:24.692
I hope that you like Syrian food.

14:24.693 --> 14:26.103
I love all food.

14:28.813 --> 14:30.561
Here. Sit down.

14:31.313 --> 14:33.898
You want to see pictures of Jay
before his growth spurt?

14:34.983 --> 14:37.022
- The stamps were stolen from him?
- By his brother.

14:37.023 --> 14:39.152
- Do you have any proof?
- No, this was during the war.

14:39.153 --> 14:40.852
- Which war?
- The Peloponnesian War.

14:40.853 --> 14:42.152
I don't know. The point is,

14:42.153 --> 14:43.692
you don't have any proof
that Donald stole them either.

14:43.693 --> 14:45.442
I'm not saying he stole them.
I'm saying they're stolen.

14:45.443 --> 14:46.773
And he has them.

14:47.983 --> 14:50.442
- Do you know Lexi Ross?
- What?

14:50.443 --> 14:53.392
Yes, she was my freshman
roommate at Princeton.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.892
- Why?
- We went to high school together.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.442
I remember her telling me
about a girl named Allison.

14:57.443 --> 14:59.424
I'm just putting this together.

15:00.313 --> 15:01.772
Lexi is the best.

15:01.773 --> 15:03.352
She is.

15:03.353 --> 15:04.392
Have you met her dude?

15:04.393 --> 15:06.352
Felix? My God.

15:06.353 --> 15:08.392
- Not the best.
- I've seen him with a monocle.

15:08.393 --> 15:10.392
- What is Lexi doing?
- Same thing she always does.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.602
Do you remember Benedict? With the macaw?

15:16.563 --> 15:18.482
- Donald.
- Right.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.982
If you release him, I think I
can get to the bottom of this

15:20.983 --> 15:22.312
and convince him to return the stamps.

15:22.313 --> 15:24.442
The stamps he says he doesn't have?

15:24.443 --> 15:26.392
Correct. But if he stays in jail,

15:26.393 --> 15:28.152
then you have a 91-year-old man in jail

15:28.153 --> 15:29.772
and no chance of getting the stamps.

15:29.773 --> 15:30.982
I can give you a week.

15:30.983 --> 15:31.983
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:31.984 --> 15:33.232
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.352
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:34.353 --> 15:35.982
Hey.

15:35.983 --> 15:37.943
Well, one big happy family.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.772
- We'll be quick.
- We?

15:44.773 --> 15:46.652
Ted. I work with Sandra.

15:46.653 --> 15:48.062
This is very nice in here.

15:48.063 --> 15:49.442
Very organized.

15:50.603 --> 15:53.022
We did some digging into
Judge Fitzpatrick.

15:53.023 --> 15:54.482
- Like you asked...
- I did not ask.

15:54.483 --> 15:56.352
Fitzpatrick has an apartment in Gramercy

15:56.353 --> 15:58.442
that he rents to the sister of the guy

15:58.443 --> 16:00.812
who owns New Roads
Juvenile Detention Center.

16:00.813 --> 16:03.482
850 square feet for $24,000 a month.

16:03.483 --> 16:05.982
She also paid a $50,000 maintenance fee

16:05.983 --> 16:08.482
and a $25,000 security deposit.

16:08.483 --> 16:10.102
We're pretty sure she's not
getting that back.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.942
Even in New York,
$24,000 is above market.

16:12.943 --> 16:15.192
But if you compare it to how
much New Roads makes per month

16:15.193 --> 16:16.942
when they're at capacity...
which they are

16:16.943 --> 16:17.893
thanks to Judge Fitzpatrick...

16:17.894 --> 16:19.462
It's a drop in the bucket.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.102
Fitzpatrick is taking kickbacks

16:22.103 --> 16:23.562
from the juvenile detention center?

16:23.563 --> 16:25.982
And laundering it through
an empty apartment.

16:25.983 --> 16:27.312
Everything you need.

16:27.313 --> 16:29.482
Deeds, tax returns,
a signed lease agreement...

16:29.483 --> 16:31.942
Plus an analysis of
Fitzpatrick's prison sentences,

16:31.943 --> 16:35.054
which shot up exponentially
after New Roads opened.

16:38.943 --> 16:41.062
- That is a case.
- It is.

16:41.063 --> 16:42.942
Against a very powerful
and respected judge.

16:42.943 --> 16:45.312
The law applies equally to everyone.

16:45.313 --> 16:48.942
- But it's not enforced equally.
- It should be.

16:48.943 --> 16:51.232
Well, sometimes you go harder on
someone to make an example.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.522
Sometimes you back off because
the price is too high.

16:53.523 --> 16:56.192
- Are you suggesting I do that here?
- Not at all.

16:56.193 --> 16:58.272
But I am saying if you take on
Judge Fitzpatrick,

16:58.273 --> 17:01.352
you need to know it's worth
the risk, the cost.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.352
You need to know whose
interest you're protecting.

17:03.353 --> 17:05.352
The public interest
in impartial justice...

17:05.353 --> 17:06.772
That's an abstraction.

17:08.603 --> 17:09.811
Who is this about?

17:09.813 --> 17:11.263
Who is the victim?

17:11.983 --> 17:16.227
If you understand that,
you'll know if it's worth it.

17:18.943 --> 17:20.392
Can you tell me about Emma's sentencing?

17:20.393 --> 17:21.652
Anything that stands out?

17:21.653 --> 17:22.892
I know it was a while ago.

17:22.893 --> 17:24.653
I remember everything.

17:25.736 --> 17:27.780
It was the worst day of our lives.

17:28.522 --> 17:31.733
Judge Fitzpatrick goes to all
the schools in the neighborhood.

17:31.734 --> 17:34.273
Holds these big assemblies.

17:34.274 --> 17:35.983
Talks to the kids about how important

17:35.984 --> 17:37.353
it is to stay out of trouble.

17:39.064 --> 17:40.233
We thought he would just give Emma

17:40.234 --> 17:42.273
one of his lectures and send her home.

17:42.274 --> 17:44.563
The parole officer told us
that her case was easy,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.313
that we didn't even need a lawyer.

17:46.314 --> 17:47.943
That a lawyer would just get in the way.

17:47.944 --> 17:49.733
Did Emma speak during the hearing?

17:49.734 --> 17:52.563
The judge asked her questions
like "How old are you?"

17:52.564 --> 17:54.353
Do you know why you're here?"

17:54.354 --> 17:56.733
He didn't even listen to her answers.

17:56.734 --> 17:58.978
He was on his phone the whole time.

17:59.854 --> 18:02.353
She's 12 years old.

18:02.354 --> 18:04.394
She belongs with her family.

18:06.854 --> 18:08.237
I'm sorry.

18:09.274 --> 18:11.103
Do you have any kids?

18:11.104 --> 18:12.854
Me? No.

18:16.154 --> 18:18.233
Having kids changes everything.

18:18.234 --> 18:20.233
Nothing matters as much
as keeping them safe.

18:20.234 --> 18:21.501
Nothing.

18:22.984 --> 18:24.879
And you'd do anything for them.

18:25.654 --> 18:27.048
We didn't know what to do.

18:28.894 --> 18:30.853
We tried, we did, but we don't
have a lot of money.

18:30.854 --> 18:32.694
We don't know anybody.

18:35.154 --> 18:37.063
I bet Judge Fitzpatrick's kids

18:37.064 --> 18:39.354
would never be thrown in jail
the way our Emma was.

18:49.444 --> 18:50.944
I'm saying yes.

18:56.062 --> 18:58.746
Ms. Littlejohn, are you ready?

18:59.694 --> 19:01.311
Yes, Your Honor, I am.

19:01.312 --> 19:04.483
Ms. Kupfer, in your review of
Judge Fitzpatrick's sentencing,

19:04.484 --> 19:08.273
did you detect any patterns with
respect to where juveniles

19:08.274 --> 19:10.313
in his court were ordered
to serve their sentences

19:10.314 --> 19:12.483
or in the lengths of those sentences?

19:12.484 --> 19:14.603
Both. With respect to length,

19:14.604 --> 19:15.733
for the first 11 years.

19:15.734 --> 19:17.523
Judge Fitzpatrick was on the bench,

19:17.524 --> 19:19.603
his average sentence was 18 months.

19:19.604 --> 19:21.233
In the last 3 years,

19:21.234 --> 19:24.153
that average has risen to 3 1/2 years.

19:24.154 --> 19:25.733
And as to where those sentenced

19:25.734 --> 19:27.693
by Judge Fitzpatrick served their terms?

19:27.694 --> 19:29.393
In the last three years,

19:29.394 --> 19:33.233
95% of those sentenced
by Judge Fitzpatrick

19:33.234 --> 19:37.233
have been assigned to New Roads
Juvenile Detention Center.

19:37.234 --> 19:40.153
- A for-profit facility?
- Yes.

19:40.154 --> 19:43.733
Mr. O'Bannon, how do private,
for-profit prisons

19:43.734 --> 19:46.893
like New Roads Juvenile
Detention Center make money?

19:46.894 --> 19:49.313
They are compensated
based on inmate population.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.893
So, the more inmates

19:50.894 --> 19:53.273
and the longer the sentences,
the more money?

19:53.274 --> 19:54.603
That is correct.

19:54.604 --> 19:57.103
Agent Moss, in the last five years,

19:57.104 --> 19:59.193
have there been any significant changes

19:59.194 --> 20:01.653
in Judge Fitzpatrick's income?

20:01.654 --> 20:03.273
Yes. Beginning three years ago,

20:03.274 --> 20:06.693
Judge Fitzpatrick's income rose by 140%.

20:06.694 --> 20:09.085
What accounts for this rise
in income, Mr. Moss?

20:09.086 --> 20:11.483
The income increase is due exclusively

20:11.484 --> 20:13.952
to the lease of an apartment
on Gramercy Park South.

20:13.953 --> 20:16.912
Ms. Romanesko, in preparation
for your testimony here today,

20:16.913 --> 20:19.912
did you have an opportunity to
visit the defendant's apartment

20:19.913 --> 20:21.722
at 80 Gramercy Park South?

20:21.723 --> 20:22.817
I did.

20:22.842 --> 20:25.042
And what, in your professional judgment,

20:25.043 --> 20:27.742
is the market rent for that property?

20:27.743 --> 20:29.162
It's a one-bedroom apartment.

20:29.163 --> 20:30.952
Average condition. No view.

20:30.953 --> 20:32.702
850 square feet.

20:32.703 --> 20:35.042
I'd price that at $3,900.

20:35.043 --> 20:37.332
Would you consider $24,000

20:37.333 --> 20:39.582
to be above market rent for that unit?

20:39.583 --> 20:42.002
I've been working in residential
real estate in Manhattan

20:42.003 --> 20:43.372
for 37 years.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.645
I've never heard of anything like that.

20:46.543 --> 20:49.502
Ms. Green, you lease apartment 100

20:49.503 --> 20:52.751
- at 80 Gramercy Park South, correct?
- Yes.

20:52.776 --> 20:54.832
And what is the monthly
rent on that unit?

20:54.833 --> 20:56.622
$24,000.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.242
And that lease began three
years ago, is that right?

20:59.243 --> 21:01.542
- Yes.
- When did you move into the apartment?

21:01.543 --> 21:03.702
I didn't. I don't live there.

21:03.703 --> 21:07.162
You pay $24,000 a month for
an apartment you don't live in?

21:07.163 --> 21:09.163
- The reason is...
- Yes or no, Ms. Green.

21:09.739 --> 21:10.832
Yes.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.582
Your brother is Roman Cox,

21:12.583 --> 21:15.452
owner of New Roads Juvenile
Detention Center, correct?

21:15.453 --> 21:16.535
Yes.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.908
And you lease this $24,000 apartment

21:18.909 --> 21:20.009
on Gramercy Park

21:20.010 --> 21:21.726
from Judge Grant Fitzpatrick, correct?

21:21.727 --> 21:22.806
Yes.

21:22.807 --> 21:25.037
Isn't it true, Ms. Green,

21:25.062 --> 21:27.662
that for the past three years,
you, your brother,

21:27.663 --> 21:30.162
and Judge Fitzpatrick
have engaged in a scheme

21:30.163 --> 21:32.242
to funnel money through this apartment?

21:32.243 --> 21:34.872
- No...
- That the $24,000 is not rent at all,

21:34.873 --> 21:38.452
but a payment from your brother
to Judge Fitzpatrick

21:38.453 --> 21:40.372
in exchange for Judge Fitzpatrick

21:40.373 --> 21:42.452
sentencing juveniles to
New Roads Detention Center?

21:42.453 --> 21:44.042
No, that is not true.

21:44.043 --> 21:45.742
I've never even met Mr. Fitzpatrick.

21:45.743 --> 21:47.502
He doesn't know my brother.
This whole thing...

21:47.503 --> 21:49.452
Then why don't you tell the jury why

21:49.453 --> 21:53.622
you pay $24,000 a month for
an apartment worth $4,000

21:53.623 --> 21:55.833
that you don't even live in, Ms. Green?

21:57.173 --> 21:58.423
For the key.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.702
What?

22:00.703 --> 22:02.412
I do it for the key.

22:02.413 --> 22:03.973
To Gramercy Park.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.792
Gramercy Park is a lovely, private park

22:07.793 --> 22:09.332
in the middle of Manhattan,

22:09.333 --> 22:12.502
and access is only available
to those living around the park.

22:12.503 --> 22:15.192
There are only about 400 keys.

22:16.243 --> 22:17.792
I grew up in New York,

22:17.793 --> 22:22.872
and I have wanted to go into
Gramercy Park my whole life.

22:22.873 --> 22:24.662
This was an opportunity.

22:24.663 --> 22:26.162
I-I know I'm overpaying,

22:26.163 --> 22:28.582
but I have the money
at this point in my life,

22:28.583 --> 22:31.412
and I didn't want to lose the chance.

22:42.453 --> 22:44.202
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

22:44.203 --> 22:46.042
- She's lying.
- That is not what the jury thinks.

22:46.043 --> 22:47.372
- We just need...
- Not we.

22:47.373 --> 22:48.912
Me. That's me up there now.

22:48.913 --> 22:50.561
It's on me, Sandra.

22:55.913 --> 22:57.622
How's it going with the stamps?

22:57.623 --> 22:59.452
Started bad, then got better,

22:59.453 --> 23:01.742
then got worse, and now it's good.

23:01.743 --> 23:03.042
He's out of jail...

23:03.043 --> 23:05.702
and now I just need to find out why...

23:05.703 --> 23:09.288
he's trying to sell the stamps on eBay?!

23:10.333 --> 23:11.487
This isn't you?

23:11.488 --> 23:12.708
No.

23:13.503 --> 23:16.253
Seller, "DonaldNewmanStamps"?

23:16.913 --> 23:20.042
- No.
- So if I e-mail the seller right now,

23:20.043 --> 23:21.792
it's not going to show up in your inbox?

23:21.793 --> 23:22.968
No.

23:26.543 --> 23:28.373
I didn't hear that.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.042
Where are the stamps?

23:34.043 --> 23:36.412
Who can say in this topsy-turvy world?

23:36.413 --> 23:39.122
Donald. I'm going to call you Donald.

23:39.123 --> 23:42.042
I know you think the stamps
were stolen from you,

23:42.043 --> 23:44.912
but that is going to be
very hard to prove,

23:44.913 --> 23:47.542
and the government
is losing patience here.

23:47.543 --> 23:48.967
You want the money.

23:48.968 --> 23:51.412
I-I understand.

23:51.413 --> 23:54.622
Maybe if you could tell me
about your financial situation,

23:54.623 --> 23:56.082
I could help you.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.372
There are resources.

23:57.373 --> 23:58.623
I don't trust you.

23:59.953 --> 24:01.503
You told me to go away.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.121
Twice.

24:03.146 --> 24:04.176
Did I?

24:06.913 --> 24:08.332
I'm here for you.

24:08.333 --> 24:10.042
I care about you.

24:10.043 --> 24:12.622
I work for you.

24:12.623 --> 24:14.353
Let me help you.

24:14.703 --> 24:19.002
If you go back to jail,
that is life or death.

24:19.003 --> 24:21.702
What is more important
than life or death?

24:25.693 --> 24:27.313
Life or death.

24:29.827 --> 24:31.912
- Isabel Morris.
- Who?

24:31.913 --> 24:34.582
My brother's great-granddaughter.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.123
She has leukemia.

24:36.458 --> 24:37.952
I'm sorry.

24:37.953 --> 24:40.742
They have this new treatment
her doctors are recommending,

24:40.743 --> 24:44.413
but... it's not covered in her insurance.

24:47.743 --> 24:51.122
L-Let's, um... Let's say that I did steal

24:51.123 --> 24:53.793
those stamps all those years ago.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.272
I regret it.

24:59.023 --> 25:01.734
I regret the fight I had with my brother.

25:02.333 --> 25:05.029
All those lost years.

25:05.663 --> 25:09.502
But now I have a-a chance to...
to make it right.

25:09.503 --> 25:14.038
I can use those damn stamps
to help my great-grandniece.

25:15.003 --> 25:19.412
If I have to sell them illegally
and go to jail to do it,

25:19.413 --> 25:21.082
so be it.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.755
They're stamps.

25:23.873 --> 25:26.342
This is a lovely little girl.

25:28.594 --> 25:30.292
What I've seen.

25:37.163 --> 25:38.872
I know this one.

25:38.873 --> 25:40.542
- Who's Jennifer Lopez?
- Yes!

25:40.543 --> 25:43.412
I told you. That's so wrong.

25:43.413 --> 25:46.292
There's a "Super Spud"
version of this classic toy.

25:46.293 --> 25:47.582
- What is Mr. Potato Head?
- What is Mr. Potato Head?

25:47.583 --> 25:49.872
- That one goes to Seth.
- Thank you, Sam!

25:49.873 --> 25:51.952
Hey, guys, it's getting
a little loud in here.

25:51.953 --> 25:53.332
I'm trying to work.

25:53.333 --> 25:56.702
It's "Jeopardy!" We can only be so quiet.

25:56.703 --> 25:59.002
What can I get you while
I am up, ya ibnee?

25:59.003 --> 26:01.202
- If you're making more tea...
- I am now.

26:12.663 --> 26:14.162
I want to dismiss the charges.

26:14.163 --> 26:15.622
No. Why?

26:15.623 --> 26:17.042
You already said no.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.372
Why do you need to know why?

26:18.373 --> 26:20.702
- Good point.
- I think this is a mistake.

26:20.703 --> 26:21.912
You still standing there? Yeah.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.742
This case is a mistake.

26:23.743 --> 26:25.622
You made a mistake.
This case isn't a mistake.

26:25.623 --> 26:27.702
I got into this case
because of Sandra Bell

26:27.703 --> 26:30.742
and a letter in purple pen
from a girl and sad parents.

26:30.743 --> 26:33.242
That was a mistake. That is not who I am.

26:34.296 --> 26:35.956
Who are you, Littlejohn?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.639
I am deliberate.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.889
I am cautious.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.679
I am precise.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.636
I am... disciplined.

26:45.637 --> 26:48.309
- You weren't any of those things today.
- That is my point.

26:48.310 --> 26:50.309
Your point is you didn't do your job

26:50.310 --> 26:51.969
and now you want to blame Sandra
and a teenage girl?

26:51.970 --> 26:53.303
That's who you are?

26:53.930 --> 26:56.009
You're out of your comfort zone.

26:56.010 --> 26:57.049
That's not a bad place to be.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.389
That's where the good lawyers are,

26:58.390 --> 26:59.549
and that's what I thought you were.

26:59.550 --> 27:00.759
You made a mistake.

27:00.760 --> 27:01.805
Now you need to fix it.

27:01.806 --> 27:03.022
What do you need to prove?

27:06.310 --> 27:08.389
That Judge Fitzpatrick knew Joanne Green

27:08.390 --> 27:10.219
and knows her brother is Roman Cox.

27:10.220 --> 27:11.697
She lied about that.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.848
And if I can show that,

27:13.849 --> 27:16.010
they'll know she was lying
about everything else.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.469
Okay, do that.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.509
Wait, is that it?

27:20.510 --> 27:21.929
You're not gonna help me anymore?

27:21.930 --> 27:23.140
No. Why?

27:25.720 --> 27:27.139
The man is 91.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.929
He was born before tape existed.

27:28.930 --> 27:30.889
- Tape!
- The man is old.

27:30.890 --> 27:31.890
The stamps are old.

27:31.891 --> 27:33.219
Sounds like a real puzzle.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.862
It's a little more complicated.

27:34.863 --> 27:37.099
In this office, we're
investigating Joanne Green.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.809
Get on task or get out.

27:38.810 --> 27:40.429
I am looking through her social media.

27:40.430 --> 27:42.639
- Look harder.
- Who's doing who the favor here?

27:42.640 --> 27:44.049
Sorry.

27:44.050 --> 27:45.599
Sorry. I appreciate the help.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.219
Thank you.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.429
Her son looks like a real weasel...

27:48.430 --> 27:50.309
- Out!
- He's wearing a sweater vest.

27:50.310 --> 27:51.679
Even if I understood
the significance of that,

27:51.680 --> 27:53.309
I would not care.

27:53.310 --> 27:54.679
Stop moving.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.389
You are very hard to read right now.

27:56.390 --> 27:58.220
I know where this picture was taken.

27:58.494 --> 28:00.719
- Can I have my phone back?
- No.

28:01.970 --> 28:04.309
Joanne's son, Noel Green,

28:04.310 --> 28:07.009
is a lawyer at
Gurnett, Reynolds, and Spear.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.849
Graduated from Yale Law.

28:08.850 --> 28:12.009
And clerked for the honorable...

28:12.010 --> 28:13.550
Judge Byrne.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.929
Can we talk?

28:22.810 --> 28:24.639
You're asking me to testify
against a judge?

28:24.640 --> 28:25.889
Yes.

28:25.890 --> 28:27.356
- In my courthouse?
- Yes.

28:28.850 --> 28:30.692
Grant was a friend of mine.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.720
- He was a good judge.
- He's not anymore.

28:36.943 --> 28:38.824
You're gonna make a name for
yourself with this either way.

28:38.848 --> 28:40.244
That's not why I'm doing it.

28:41.493 --> 28:43.080
There are worse reasons.

28:44.430 --> 28:46.010
There are better ones, too.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.179
Ms. Littlejohn.

28:49.180 --> 28:50.719
Thank you, Your Honor.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.257
The government calls
Judge Nicholas Byrne.

28:54.180 --> 28:57.049
Judge Byrne, what is your
current occupation?

28:57.050 --> 29:00.099
I am the Chief Judge of the
United States District Court

29:00.100 --> 29:01.349
for the Southern District of New York.

29:01.350 --> 29:02.809
- This court?
- Yes.

29:02.810 --> 29:04.890
How do you feel about
testifying here today?

29:06.930 --> 29:08.219
Uncomfortable.

29:08.220 --> 29:11.049
I understand.
And we appreciate you coming in.

29:11.050 --> 29:14.099
Are you familiar with a Noel Green?

29:14.100 --> 29:16.549
Yes. He was one of my law clerks.

29:16.550 --> 29:18.469
Can you tell us how
Mr. Green came to work

29:18.470 --> 29:19.719
as a law clerk for you?

29:19.720 --> 29:21.139
Well, he applied as a part of the normal

29:21.140 --> 29:22.889
clerkship application process.

29:22.890 --> 29:25.139
Subsequent of that, I received

29:25.140 --> 29:27.309
a variety of personal recommendations

29:27.310 --> 29:29.394
from Yale Law faculty
advocating for Noel.

29:29.395 --> 29:32.360
In addition to recommendations
from Yale Law faculty,

29:32.361 --> 29:35.509
did anyone else reach out
to you about Mr. Green?

29:35.510 --> 29:37.719
- Yes.
- Who?

29:37.720 --> 29:39.445
Judge Grant Fitzpatrick.

29:39.446 --> 29:41.099
- The defendant?
- Yes.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.259
- He called you?
- Yes.

29:43.260 --> 29:45.139
What did Judge Fitzpatrick say

29:45.140 --> 29:46.389
when he called you about Mr. Green?

29:46.390 --> 29:48.639
He said the sister of
a friend of his had a son

29:48.640 --> 29:50.349
at Yale Law School and he thought he'd be

29:50.350 --> 29:51.830
a good candidate for my chambers.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.968
Did he indicate who the friend was?

29:53.969 --> 29:56.758
Yes. He said his friend's name
was Roman Cox.

29:56.759 --> 30:00.048
- And Mr. Cox's sister?
- Joanne Green.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.508
Is it your understanding
that Judge Fitzpatrick

30:02.509 --> 30:05.838
has a personal relationship
with Mr. Cox and Ms. Green?

30:05.839 --> 30:07.678
- Yes.
- Based on that conversation?

30:07.679 --> 30:10.638
- Yes.
- Anything else?

30:10.639 --> 30:12.678
On at least two occasions,

30:12.679 --> 30:16.378
Judge Fitzpatrick, Ms. Green,
and Mr. Cox visited Noel

30:16.379 --> 30:18.588
in my chambers while Noel
was clerking for me.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.218
I just had that case
with Holiday Colgate,

30:26.219 --> 30:27.758
whose parents tried to evict her,

30:27.759 --> 30:29.928
and I told them that it's totally fine

30:29.929 --> 30:31.138
for adults to live with their parents

30:31.139 --> 30:32.798
as long as it makes everybody happy.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.428
And you like living with your parents?

30:34.429 --> 30:36.088
I do. I-I did.

30:36.089 --> 30:37.378
But should I?

30:37.379 --> 30:38.968
I'm a grown man who doesn't know how much

30:38.969 --> 30:40.548
a gallon of milk costs.

30:40.549 --> 30:42.258
Could be $20. Could be $10.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.798
- About $4.
- See?

30:43.799 --> 30:45.428
Never would have guessed that.

30:45.429 --> 30:47.468
I've never filled my own refrigerator.

30:47.469 --> 30:49.378
I have no idea what electricity costs.

30:49.379 --> 30:50.638
It's more than milk.

30:50.639 --> 30:52.048
That makes sense.

30:52.049 --> 30:54.638
Watching Seth in my house
has been a real mirror.

30:54.639 --> 30:57.008
It took exactly two minutes
for a U.S. Attorney

30:57.009 --> 30:59.798
to be completely infantilized
by my mom and dad.

30:59.799 --> 31:01.879
It is not a good look
on a 28-year-old man.

31:02.511 --> 31:04.048
I'm so happy!

31:04.049 --> 31:06.218
I never want to leave Jay's parents.

31:06.219 --> 31:09.178
You have to try his mom's mujaddara.

31:09.179 --> 31:10.310
I'm good.

31:11.639 --> 31:13.048
So, when can you move back
into your place?

31:13.049 --> 31:15.138
- Friday.
- It is Friday.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.638
Next Friday.

31:16.639 --> 31:18.218
That's a long time.

31:18.219 --> 31:19.428
You sure your landlord
has someone working?

31:19.429 --> 31:20.678
If not, that's a clear breach of...

31:20.679 --> 31:22.678
Okay, fine. The work is done.

31:22.679 --> 31:24.548
I can move back in.

31:24.549 --> 31:28.218
I just... haven't yet.

31:28.219 --> 31:29.638
Maybe I should move out.

31:29.639 --> 31:32.678
I could still put in shifts,
and I'm sure I'd be back a lot.

31:32.679 --> 31:34.378
Maybe I just need some space.

31:34.379 --> 31:36.962
Does that make me an ungrateful son?

31:38.818 --> 31:40.688
Makes you a grown-ass man.

31:44.759 --> 31:45.834
I have to leave, don't I?

31:45.835 --> 31:48.218
Dude, you're a man.
You are a U.S. Attorney.

31:48.219 --> 31:49.588
If hanging with someone's
parents in Queens

31:49.589 --> 31:50.968
is the best you're doing,

31:50.969 --> 31:52.759
you should be doing something different.

31:57.509 --> 31:58.607
You baked?

31:59.972 --> 32:01.222
You?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.282
Okay.

32:05.969 --> 32:08.339
We just have to get this over with.

32:09.429 --> 32:10.718
Kate!

32:10.719 --> 32:13.686
No! I thought it might calm my nerves.

32:13.687 --> 32:15.878
I sliced premade dough
and burned it in the oven.

32:15.879 --> 32:17.548
It's me, Al! Sandra!

32:17.549 --> 32:20.138
- Refrigerated dough in a tube?
- Yes, of course!

32:20.139 --> 32:21.758
Always refrigerated. Always in a tube.

32:21.759 --> 32:23.928
You had no idea how long
to leave it in there?

32:23.929 --> 32:25.468
Nope. None.

32:25.469 --> 32:27.269
Just randomly punching numbers
into the timer.

32:27.721 --> 32:29.759
You're really feeling this nervous?

32:33.839 --> 32:36.178
Kate's closing is tomorrow.

32:36.179 --> 32:39.838
I'm sure she'll do great,
but I started all this,

32:39.839 --> 32:42.259
and I have no control over how it ends.

32:44.799 --> 32:46.156
It's scary.

32:47.449 --> 32:49.088
I know how you feel.

32:49.089 --> 32:53.678
Donald has to return these
stamps, but he needs the money.

32:53.679 --> 32:55.838
If he could sell the stamps,
how much would they go for?

32:55.839 --> 32:57.522
- A few million.
- Million?!

32:57.523 --> 32:59.378
Didn't you say these were 24-cent stamps?

32:59.379 --> 33:00.838
100 years ago.

33:00.839 --> 33:02.588
I've never understood inflation.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.838
This is about scarcity, not inflation.

33:04.839 --> 33:07.009
Inflation is the increase...

33:08.969 --> 33:10.508
Inflation.

33:10.509 --> 33:11.639
That's it.

33:13.139 --> 33:15.258
We're celebrating.

33:15.259 --> 33:18.758
I found this while I was
researching the stamps.

33:18.759 --> 33:21.878
In 1959, the Philatelic
Foundation offered

33:21.879 --> 33:25.968
a $25,000 reward for the return
of the inverted Jennys.

33:25.969 --> 33:29.588
So, let's say you didn't
steal the stamps.

33:29.589 --> 33:32.008
Assuming the reward still stands,

33:32.009 --> 33:35.718
I think it should be adjusted
for inflation, don't you?

33:35.719 --> 33:39.178
Someone's been catching up
on her "Matlock."

33:39.179 --> 33:40.591
These are disgusting.

33:40.592 --> 33:41.678
Yes.

33:41.679 --> 33:43.338
Tastes like firewood.

33:43.339 --> 33:44.928
Yeah, my roommate.

33:44.929 --> 33:47.468
She's not a baker.

33:49.719 --> 33:51.138
Three years ago,

33:51.139 --> 33:54.088
New York Family Court Judge
Grant Fitzpatrick

33:54.089 --> 33:57.378
began imposing longer sentences

33:57.379 --> 34:00.178
and directed that those
sentenced in his court

34:00.179 --> 34:02.928
serve them at New Roads
Juvenile Detention Center,

34:02.929 --> 34:06.878
a for-profit jail owned by Roman Cox.

34:06.879 --> 34:10.257
At the exact same time he did this,

34:10.259 --> 34:12.967
Judge Fitzpatrick
began leasing an apartment

34:12.969 --> 34:15.967
to Mr. Cox's sister, Joanne Green,

34:15.969 --> 34:18.878
for the outrageous rent
of $24,000 a month.

34:18.879 --> 34:21.297
In fact, it wasn't rent at all.

34:21.299 --> 34:22.678
It was a payment.

34:22.679 --> 34:25.007
Money to Judge Fitzpatrick

34:25.009 --> 34:28.507
in exchange for kids
to New Roads for Mr. Cox.

34:28.509 --> 34:30.717
Cash for kids.

34:30.719 --> 34:31.775
That's what this was.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.589
Cash for kids.

34:34.804 --> 34:35.965
Kids.

34:37.929 --> 34:39.838
We don't know why
Judge Fitzpatrick did this,

34:39.839 --> 34:41.338
but we know what it means.

34:41.339 --> 34:45.007
It means he hurt children
and their parents,

34:45.009 --> 34:48.820
that he destroyed families, real ones.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.717
And those are the ones that matter.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.908
Those are the ones
I want you to think about.

34:53.219 --> 34:56.217
He also hurt this family,
and that matters, too.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.218
This justice system... it is a family.

34:59.219 --> 35:02.378
We argue like brother and sister
on both sides,

35:02.379 --> 35:03.968
and we do it before a parent,

35:03.969 --> 35:06.798
an honest broker, a figure of decency

35:06.799 --> 35:08.588
and integrity and wisdom.

35:08.589 --> 35:10.798
A person who says, "I've heard
you, and I'm gonna be fair."

35:10.799 --> 35:12.638
And this is what I'm gonna do."

35:12.639 --> 35:15.338
And we don't always agree
with it, but we respect it.

35:15.339 --> 35:16.428
All of us.

35:16.429 --> 35:21.589
And that is important to all of us.

35:24.929 --> 35:27.928
It is fitting that
Judge Fitzpatrick was undone

35:27.929 --> 35:31.338
by a great and honorable judge,
but the work isn't over.

35:31.339 --> 35:33.178
Now it is your turn.

35:33.179 --> 35:35.968
You, too, are part of this family.

35:35.969 --> 35:37.469
Protect it.

35:39.879 --> 35:41.468
Defend it.

35:49.429 --> 35:50.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:50.799 --> 35:52.298
Let me just close this up,
and we'll hit the train.

35:52.299 --> 35:53.968
Actually, my apartment's all fixed,

35:53.969 --> 35:56.298
so I'll be moving back home.

35:57.469 --> 35:58.928
Okay.

35:58.929 --> 36:00.088
Yeah.

36:00.089 --> 36:02.048
Right. Cool.

36:02.049 --> 36:03.508
Probably nice to get back
to your own space.

36:03.509 --> 36:04.968
- Peace and quiet.
- Yeah.

36:04.969 --> 36:06.428
Definitely.

36:08.679 --> 36:10.718
It's been really fun
to be with your folks.

36:10.719 --> 36:13.178
They're great.

36:13.179 --> 36:16.928
I really miss hanging out
with, you know, people.

36:16.929 --> 36:18.298
Kind of in your face, though, right?

36:18.299 --> 36:20.258
- Now you can just walk the halls.
- By myself.

36:20.259 --> 36:21.718
- No one to tell you what to do.
- No one at all.

36:21.719 --> 36:22.719
- Freedom.
- Loneliness.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.058
- Independence.
- Isolation.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.928
- Do you want a roommate?
- If you're ever looking for a place...

36:25.929 --> 36:27.428
I-I do have an extra room.

36:27.429 --> 36:29.138
And you need someone to watch TV with.

36:29.139 --> 36:31.218
And I can tell my parents
I'm moving out for you,

36:31.219 --> 36:32.968
which they'll totally buy
because they think

36:32.969 --> 36:34.690
living alone is
the saddest thing in the world.

36:34.691 --> 36:35.871
It's kind of perfect.

36:35.896 --> 36:37.088
Do you think your mom
will bring food over?

36:37.089 --> 36:38.469
All the time.

36:39.679 --> 36:41.878
All right!

36:41.879 --> 36:45.088
I can't believe
what wonderful shape they're in.

36:45.089 --> 36:47.218
Thank you for returning them to us.

36:47.219 --> 36:51.484
Thank you for
the billion-dollar check.

36:58.259 --> 37:01.428
She... She knows
it's just a stamp, right?

37:02.589 --> 37:04.298
- Donald.
- Yeah?

37:04.299 --> 37:06.178
There are some people here to see you.

37:06.179 --> 37:07.258
Okay.

37:57.219 --> 38:01.588
Madam Foreperson,
have you reached a verdict?

38:01.589 --> 38:03.009
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

38:05.679 --> 38:07.638
As to count one,

38:07.639 --> 38:10.299
money laundering, how do
you find the defendant?

38:11.719 --> 38:12.941
Guilty.

38:14.429 --> 38:16.138
As to count two,

38:16.139 --> 38:19.508
theft of honest services,
how do you find the defendant?

38:19.509 --> 38:20.758
Guilty.

38:25.379 --> 38:28.218
Judge Fitzpatrick is going to
prison for the rest of his life.

38:28.219 --> 38:31.639
He is never going to hurt
another kid ever again.

38:31.939 --> 38:33.349
All because of you.

38:34.469 --> 38:37.338
And now we're going to appeal
and get you out here.

38:37.339 --> 38:39.968
I will go with your lawyer to
every hearing if I have to.

38:39.969 --> 38:42.338
I told you... I'm very good
at bugging people.

38:49.299 --> 38:50.968
What do you want, Emma?

38:50.969 --> 38:53.549
I want people to know
what this is really like.

38:56.049 --> 38:58.611
I want people to understand.

38:59.339 --> 39:02.468
Then we can make them understand.

39:02.469 --> 39:05.638
Today, before I impose your sentence,

39:05.639 --> 39:09.298
we are going to hear testimony
from some of your victims.

39:09.299 --> 39:11.138
That does not make up for the fact

39:11.139 --> 39:12.878
that they were silenced
in your courtroom,

39:12.879 --> 39:15.838
but I hope it gives them some peace

39:15.839 --> 39:19.338
knowing that you finally heard
what they had to say.

39:19.339 --> 39:22.338
I was arrested for making fun of
my principal on my website.

39:22.339 --> 39:24.878
No one told me what
it meant to plead guilty.

39:24.879 --> 39:29.178
While my friends were all in
school, I was in a 6x10 cell.

39:29.179 --> 39:31.008
They put cuffs on my wrists and ankles.

39:31.009 --> 39:32.638
I still have nightmares.

39:32.639 --> 39:34.508
- I didn't even have a lawyer.
- I'll never forget it.

39:34.509 --> 39:36.878
- It's been four years.
- I was 13 years old.

39:36.879 --> 39:38.610
I lost a whole year.

39:40.009 --> 39:42.298
I miss my mom and dad.

39:42.299 --> 39:45.008
I miss the sound of my dad
in the kitchen.

39:45.009 --> 39:47.619
I miss my mom brushing my hair.

39:48.379 --> 39:50.079
I miss my little brother.

39:52.112 --> 39:55.732
He was seven when you put me
in jail, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.818
He's nine now.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.845
I want you to know this.

40:06.578 --> 40:09.458
I want you to know what you did to me.

40:09.719 --> 40:12.878
I want you to know that
you took things from me
