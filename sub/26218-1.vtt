Lenita:
Cute kids.

01:06.618 --> 01:08.206
You've kept them
out of the spotlight.

01:08.309 --> 01:10.139
They've kept themselves out
pretty much.

01:10.242 --> 01:11.795
Mind you, they don't look
like that anymore.

01:11.899 --> 01:14.350
You look exactly the same,
though.

01:14.453 --> 01:16.386
Well, maybe that's the secret
to aging.

01:16.490 --> 01:17.663
If you're exhausted
in your 20s,

01:17.767 --> 01:20.356
you more or less look the same
in your 40s.

01:20.459 --> 01:23.704
We've heard a lot
about this term lately -- WAGs.

01:23.807 --> 01:25.050
Is it sexist?

01:25.154 --> 01:27.052
Kath, as a former model
and the wife

01:27.156 --> 01:28.812
of the Southern Jets coach,
what do you think?

01:28.916 --> 01:30.573
Look, Lenita.

01:30.676 --> 01:33.334
The truth is that the wives
and girlfriends of footballers,

01:33.438 --> 01:35.474
like the partners
of anyone in society,

01:35.578 --> 01:38.719
come from an incredibly diverse
range of backgrounds.

01:38.822 --> 01:41.549
A lot of us don't have
anything in common,

01:41.653 --> 01:43.931
except for the support
we give our partners.

01:44.034 --> 01:45.243
Sure, like a lot of labels,

01:45.346 --> 01:47.348
it -- it can be used as
a stereotype.

01:47.452 --> 01:49.178
But at the end of the day,
it's just a word.

01:49.281 --> 01:51.387
I mean, it's not even that.
It's an acronym.

01:51.490 --> 01:54.700
So, you know, you can call me
anything you like,

01:54.804 --> 01:57.047
but to my friends,
I'm Kath.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.291
Your husband, Brian,
has had an incredible career.

01:59.395 --> 02:00.913
We're very proud of him.

02:01.017 --> 02:04.331
But Jack Davies' meltdown
at last year's Grand Final

02:04.434 --> 02:07.368
must have been a real low.

02:08.024 --> 02:10.130
You know, there were 16 teams

02:10.233 --> 02:12.787
that didn't make the make it
to the Grand Final last year.

02:12.891 --> 02:14.272
We did.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.274
Of course, but everyone
at the Southern Jets

02:16.377 --> 02:20.209
must be feeling it --
losing by a single point.

02:20.312 --> 02:23.177
Doesn't get much closer
than that, does it?

02:23.281 --> 02:24.661
Man on radio: It's a beautiful
day in Melbourne,

02:24.765 --> 02:27.043
and there's nothing like
the start of a new season.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.425
It's a clean slate,
and anything is possible.

02:29.528 --> 02:32.013
We're still a few weeks out from
the start of the season proper,

02:32.117 --> 02:34.326
but the footy is well
and truly back.

02:34.430 --> 02:35.672
The Southern Jets' form

02:35.776 --> 02:37.329
has already copped
plenty of criticism,

02:37.433 --> 02:38.917
and there's a lot riding
on the new recruits

02:39.020 --> 02:40.470
to hit the ground running

02:40.574 --> 02:42.714
for their first
home-and-away match.

02:42.817 --> 02:45.475
I mean, everyone's been
real supportive, uh...

02:45.579 --> 02:47.684
Eye contact.

02:48.409 --> 02:49.962
I mean,
it's a pretty big adjustment.

02:50.066 --> 02:52.413
You know, it's a bit
like starting school again.

02:52.517 --> 02:53.794
Very nice.

02:53.897 --> 02:55.658
Goals for the season.

02:55.761 --> 02:57.038
Just be there for the boys

02:57.142 --> 03:00.456
and turn up at every
training session, and...

03:00.559 --> 03:03.079
follow up in the gym
and on the field.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.460
And?

03:06.013 --> 03:07.911
Um, stamina.

03:08.015 --> 03:09.223
Get my fitness up
so I'm not so knackered at --

03:09.327 --> 03:10.949
Tired.

03:11.052 --> 03:13.227
...tired at the end
of the day.

03:13.331 --> 03:14.401
Getting better.

03:16.265 --> 03:18.543
Okay. Let's pick this up
again tomorrow.

03:18.646 --> 03:20.648
All right.
Thanks.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.755
Oh, one last thing.

03:23.858 --> 03:25.619
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah.

03:25.722 --> 03:26.965
Don't let her talk.

03:27.068 --> 03:28.932
What?
In general?

03:29.036 --> 03:31.418
To the media --
about anything.

03:31.521 --> 03:33.005
Right.

03:33.109 --> 03:34.628
Got it.

03:36.112 --> 03:37.631
Man:
Yes.

03:37.734 --> 03:38.873
Man:
Yes, yes, yes!

03:41.980 --> 03:43.395
Hey.

03:43.499 --> 03:44.810
How'd you go?

03:44.914 --> 03:46.156
Well, how do you think?

03:46.260 --> 03:48.020
They ask about Jack again?

03:48.124 --> 03:49.436
Oh, they're bored.

03:49.539 --> 03:51.092
They'll forget all about it
by the first win.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.473
Bloody journos.

03:52.577 --> 03:54.095
They bang on
about team cohesion,

03:54.199 --> 03:55.994
and they won't stop
hanging shit on us.

03:56.097 --> 03:57.961
Yeah. Biting back
won't get you anywhere.

03:58.065 --> 04:00.170
So what am I supposed to do?
Roll over?

04:00.274 --> 04:01.965
Been doing that all summer.Be patient.

04:02.069 --> 04:05.175
You need them as much
as they need you.

04:07.557 --> 04:09.973
Daniel looks like
he's settling in.

04:10.077 --> 04:11.492
Missing his girlfriend
a bit.

04:11.596 --> 04:15.462
Oh.
That's refreshing.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.783
Dan!

04:26.887 --> 04:27.784
Come here!

04:29.579 --> 04:30.960
Mm!
Mm!

04:31.063 --> 04:32.479
Ooh.

04:38.001 --> 04:39.486
We're never leaving
Melbourne.

04:39.589 --> 04:42.074
I'm setting a five--
no, 10-year minimum.

04:42.178 --> 04:43.835
I can't survive
another farewell.

04:43.938 --> 04:45.285
Don't even know if
you're gonna like it here yet.

04:45.388 --> 04:48.115
You and I, we're never doing
long-distance again.

04:48.218 --> 04:49.668
Well, that's lucky.

04:49.772 --> 04:51.636
I thought I was gonna have to
break up with you.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.991
Paige: What do you mean
you haven't seen it?

05:02.094 --> 05:03.786
Well, I was waiting for you.
You ready?

05:03.889 --> 05:04.925
One...

05:05.028 --> 05:06.409
Three.

05:07.514 --> 05:09.723
Holy shit.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.211
Oh, my...
I...

05:15.315 --> 05:18.145
I thought they'd put you up with
other players, but this is...

05:18.248 --> 05:20.423
You're a big deal.No. The club owns it.

05:20.527 --> 05:22.322
It was Connor Marrello's
when he first got here.

05:22.425 --> 05:25.255
It hands-down beats
the joint I've been staying at.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.327
What else have you got in here?
You got a cinema room?

05:27.430 --> 05:29.156
A lap pool?I don't know. Maybe.

05:32.435 --> 05:35.507
We've got blackout blinds
with a remote in the spare room.

05:35.611 --> 05:36.957
We've got coconut water
here!

05:37.060 --> 05:38.993
It's water made entirely
of coconut!

05:39.097 --> 05:41.030
What?!
We've got two toilets!

05:41.133 --> 05:42.307
What?

05:42.411 --> 05:43.860
Two toilets.
One each.

05:43.964 --> 05:46.898
We're never fighting again.

05:49.935 --> 05:52.282
There's a barbecue today
at the coach's house.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.698
Well, you don't have to come.

05:53.801 --> 05:55.493
You've got your big
job interview tomorrow.

05:55.596 --> 05:56.459
Mm-hmm.

05:56.563 --> 05:58.116
When you win the Brownlow,

05:58.219 --> 06:01.050
you still have to come

anything about a dress code?

06:20.656 --> 06:22.347
Hey.
Huh?

06:22.451 --> 06:24.625
We're gonna have fun.
I promise.

06:24.729 --> 06:27.041
Okay. If either of us get stuck,
we just shoot bat signals.

06:27.145 --> 06:28.664
Or whistle.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.321
Or make inappropriately long

06:53.861 --> 06:55.276
I'm not drinking.I am.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.589
Hair of the dog.Of course. What would you like?

06:57.693 --> 06:59.867
Anything cold.Oh, w-we're fine, actually.

06:59.971 --> 07:01.110
Yeah.
Thanks.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.836
So, you're here
with Daniel.

07:02.939 --> 07:05.183
Okay. That's a bit creepy.

07:05.286 --> 07:06.943
You're obviously a footy fan,
then.

07:07.047 --> 07:08.462
Yes, you could say that.

07:08.566 --> 07:10.050
Paige, this isn't just a fan.
He's --

07:10.153 --> 07:11.672
We're all very much
looking forward

07:11.776 --> 07:13.502
to seeing what he can do.

07:13.605 --> 07:15.193
Yeah.
Especially me.

07:15.296 --> 07:16.815
It's all about controlling
the nerves

07:16.919 --> 07:19.439
the first few games, you know?I'll remember that.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.268
Enjoy.

07:21.958 --> 07:24.754
Daniel.Hey, Kath! Amazing place.

07:24.858 --> 07:27.516
Hey, this is, uh, Paige.Paige, hello.

07:27.619 --> 07:29.863
It's really nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

07:29.966 --> 07:33.107
And I about you.

07:33.211 --> 07:35.109
Yeah.
But no, thanks for having us.

07:35.213 --> 07:37.560
And I see you've met
our club president.

07:37.664 --> 07:39.320
Hm?
Andrew MacLeish.

07:41.150 --> 07:42.807
I tried to tell you.

07:42.910 --> 07:44.567
Oi, Fletcher!

07:44.671 --> 07:45.741
That's the captain.

07:45.844 --> 07:46.949
♪ Give a little

07:47.052 --> 07:48.537
Go do your footy business.
I'm good.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.779
Are you sure?

07:49.883 --> 07:51.540
Yeah, course.

07:51.643 --> 07:53.783
Ah.

07:53.887 --> 07:55.958
You know, a lot of girls
struggle with that.

07:56.061 --> 07:57.615
With what?

07:57.718 --> 08:00.480
You know, how there's three
people in your relationship now.

08:00.583 --> 08:04.000
You, Daniel, and Sherrin.

08:04.104 --> 08:07.141
The football.
You know, the brand.

08:07.245 --> 08:10.662
It's not important.
Why don't you come with me?

08:10.766 --> 08:12.871
Ladies, I'd like you to meet
Fletcher's girlfriend.

08:12.975 --> 08:14.494
This is Paige Dunkeley.

08:14.597 --> 08:16.496
Hey, mate.

08:17.255 --> 08:18.359
Hi.
Hello.

08:18.463 --> 08:19.602
Hello!

08:19.706 --> 08:21.742
So, this is Maddy.
This is Trav's wife.

08:21.846 --> 08:23.951
Two kids,
lover of losing consciousness.

08:24.055 --> 08:25.608
I don't sleep, ever.

08:25.712 --> 08:27.023
And this is Jessie,
Jack's wife,

08:27.127 --> 08:28.646
who's about to make a comeback
of her own

08:28.749 --> 08:30.958
that will eclipse even
her husband on the footy field.

08:31.062 --> 08:32.408
You know, it's possible.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.203
If you don't compare us
on a few key points.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.999
You know, like income.Oh, yeah, but I'm a teacher,

08:37.102 --> 08:39.208
and we don't even make
pay parity, so...

08:39.311 --> 08:40.002
Sorry.

08:40.105 --> 08:41.382
Don't be.

08:42.591 --> 08:45.386
Hey, Jess, where's his blankie?
Your mum's here.

08:45.490 --> 08:46.871
Jessie:
Uh, should be in his bag, Jack.

08:46.974 --> 08:48.666
No, it's not there.Did you try the side pocket?

08:48.769 --> 08:51.461
It gets stuck in there
sometimes.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.670
No. Bugger.
I know where it is.

08:52.773 --> 08:54.464
Um, sorry.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.156
Hey, Jack, it's in the car!

08:56.259 --> 08:58.020
Maddy:
That's Jack and their son JJ.

08:58.123 --> 08:59.331
Yeah.
Father-son rule.

08:59.435 --> 09:00.816
He'll be the third generation
of Davies

09:00.919 --> 09:02.300
to come through this club.

09:02.403 --> 09:03.991
He's a toddler.

09:04.095 --> 09:05.545
Yeah, and?

09:05.648 --> 09:08.824
What if he doesn't like
footy?

09:08.927 --> 09:11.033
You know what?
She should meet Tahlia.

09:11.136 --> 09:13.000
Tahlia!

09:13.104 --> 09:15.658
Paige, this is Tahlia,
Connor's girlfriend.

09:15.762 --> 09:18.040
Tahlia,
this is Paige Dunkeley.

09:18.143 --> 09:20.387
Hello.
Oh! Welcome!

09:21.353 --> 09:24.460
Wow.
You're so soft.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.807
Oh. That's sweet.

09:26.911 --> 09:28.775
Thank you.

09:28.878 --> 09:31.363
Y-You know, um, a mate of mine
back in Casterton

09:31.467 --> 09:33.158
is, like,
obsessed with you.

09:33.262 --> 09:36.196
N-Not like "kill you,
wear your skin" obsessed.

09:36.299 --> 09:38.612
She --
She really likes your...

09:38.716 --> 09:40.821
uh, well, your everything,
really, whole package.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.206
Casterton,
birthplace of the kelpie?

09:46.309 --> 09:47.794
Oh. Yeah.
You've been?

09:47.897 --> 09:49.278
No.
No, no, no.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.900
But I am very good
at remembering random facts.

09:51.004 --> 09:53.247
I don't want
to toot my own horn,

09:53.351 --> 09:56.043
but I would be an incredible
asset to any trivia team.

09:56.147 --> 09:57.286
Yeah.
You would, actually.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.908
Oh.
Thank you.

09:59.012 --> 10:01.186
Is that...bread?

10:01.290 --> 10:03.879
Oh.
Yeah, and sausages.

10:03.982 --> 10:06.640
I think I got the wrong info.
I thought this was a barbecue.

10:06.744 --> 10:09.367
Oh, you are too kind.
Thank you.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.438
I'll just get rid of that
for you.

10:11.541 --> 10:13.613
I won't be offended
if no one eats it.

10:13.716 --> 10:15.062
Thank you.

10:16.961 --> 10:20.585
You know, Tahlia has a really
big launch tomorrow.

10:20.689 --> 10:23.001
Oh, that sounds exciting.

10:23.105 --> 10:25.107
For what?It's my first fragrance.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.040
Tahlia by Tahlia.

10:27.143 --> 10:28.489
It's gonna be really fancy.

10:28.593 --> 10:31.113
Lots of freebies.Lots of wine.

10:31.216 --> 10:32.770
You should come along.

10:32.873 --> 10:34.461
Shouldn't she?

10:34.564 --> 10:35.496
Sure.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.775
Oh.
Um, that's lovely.

10:37.878 --> 10:39.742
But I've got this big
job interview tomorrow,

10:39.846 --> 10:41.951
so I'll probably just hang low
with Dan.

10:42.055 --> 10:44.574
Oh, he's coming.
All the boys are.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.645
Didn't he mention that?

10:45.748 --> 10:46.991
Uh, no.

10:47.094 --> 10:48.544
You know, it would be
a great opportunity

10:48.648 --> 10:50.063
for you to meet everyone.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.582
Especially before
the season starts.

10:53.722 --> 10:55.793
I should get back to Dan.

10:55.896 --> 10:58.278
Oh, I think Trav's cornered him,
so he could be a while.

10:58.381 --> 11:00.280
Okay.

11:02.731 --> 11:05.078
She's a live wire.

11:05.181 --> 11:06.873
I like her.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.498
Didn't plan it that way.

11:11.601 --> 11:13.051
Of course,
if I had the choice,

11:13.155 --> 11:16.192
I'd rather go out on top.

11:16.296 --> 11:17.987
But I'm enjoying
being on the coaching staff.

11:18.091 --> 11:19.402
You're a natural, mate.

11:19.506 --> 11:21.094
I don't know what you
were worried about.

11:21.197 --> 11:22.060
Hey.
Having fun?

11:22.164 --> 11:23.165
Yeah.
Heaps.

11:23.268 --> 11:24.994
You about ready to go?

11:26.306 --> 11:28.308
I should probably stay
for the speeches.

11:28.411 --> 11:29.999
Kath was gonna give me a tour
anyway.

11:30.103 --> 11:31.656
You should count the toilets.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.521
Stand by for updates.

11:37.144 --> 11:38.836
Something's different.

11:40.182 --> 11:43.081
You've exfoliated.

11:43.185 --> 11:44.255
You've had sex.

11:44.358 --> 11:46.636
I havehad sex.
Mm.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.224
And won something?

11:48.328 --> 11:51.055
You've won something
while having sex?

11:51.158 --> 11:54.644
I, um...I think I'm about
to be offered partner.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.164
Ding, ding, ding!

11:57.268 --> 11:58.510
I'm not sure I can take it,

11:58.614 --> 12:00.271
not with Trav still coaching
and the kids.

12:00.374 --> 12:02.031
Oh.
Well, listen.

12:02.135 --> 12:05.932
You should be taking anyjob
that makes you look like that.

12:17.322 --> 12:18.841
I wouldn't go there.
What?

12:18.945 --> 12:22.569
Oh, no.
Uh, I thought she was waving.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.605
Mm. Yeah.
Where's your missus?

12:24.709 --> 12:26.987
Oh, she's here.How long you been together?

12:27.091 --> 12:28.540
Oh, three and a bit years.

12:28.644 --> 12:30.819
Oh, so she's
your chicken schnitty.

12:30.922 --> 12:33.131
My what?Your go-to, your favorite.

12:33.235 --> 12:36.100
Oh, well, my only, really.

12:36.203 --> 12:37.653
Now you're in Melbourne,
mate.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.069
Whole different bunch
of cuisines on the menu.

12:40.173 --> 12:41.105
Oh.
Yeah.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.244
Yeah.
There you go.

12:42.347 --> 12:44.142
Oh, I'm with you now.
No.

12:44.246 --> 12:46.144
Not much of a foodie,
meself.

12:46.248 --> 12:47.180
Woman:
Babe?

12:47.283 --> 12:48.802
Mm.
Hi.

12:48.906 --> 12:50.459
You said
you weren't drinking.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.392
Babe, I lied.

12:52.495 --> 12:54.601
Oh.

12:56.016 --> 12:58.363
She your...schnitty?

12:58.467 --> 13:00.607
No, mate.
She's more of a seasonal tree.

13:00.710 --> 13:01.988
You'll catch on.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.682
Hi!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.822
Uh...
Uh, sorry. I think --

13:08.926 --> 13:10.375
I met your girlfriend.

13:10.479 --> 13:11.480
Ah. Paige.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.447
Yeah.
She's nice.

13:13.551 --> 13:14.932
Sweet.

13:16.036 --> 13:17.313
I-I like her.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.453
That's good to know.

13:27.461 --> 13:30.188
This isn't easy for me.

13:30.292 --> 13:31.534
Rusty:
And what am I meant to do?

13:31.638 --> 13:33.951
Nothing.
That's the whole point.

13:34.054 --> 13:35.815
Okay. So I just disappear?No, no, no. Of course not.

13:35.918 --> 13:38.024
He does not change
how we both feel.

13:38.127 --> 13:41.372
There's nothing I can do
about that.

13:43.788 --> 13:46.618
Took a bit of pushing,
but they're on board.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.899
It's the right move.

13:51.002 --> 13:53.694
I didn't say a word.

13:53.798 --> 13:55.282
Any plans tonight?

13:55.386 --> 13:59.010
Might be a five-star hotel
with my name on it.

13:59.114 --> 13:59.942
You?

14:02.358 --> 14:04.360
I thought I might head into town
myself,

14:04.464 --> 14:07.122
see if I can bump into
someone special.

14:08.571 --> 14:10.919
You let me know
how you go with that.

14:17.995 --> 14:19.893
Hi.
I'm Paige.

14:19.997 --> 14:21.446
I'm --
I'm Daniel's girlfriend.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.585
Lauren.

14:22.689 --> 14:24.691
Are you someone's wife
or girlfriend?

14:24.794 --> 14:26.520
No. No.
I'm one of the club doctors.

14:26.624 --> 14:28.902
And I'm divorced,
so that's a double no.

14:30.214 --> 14:32.630
All right. Listen up.

14:32.733 --> 14:34.528
You will need this.

14:34.632 --> 14:36.772
Brian's preseason speeches
go on a bit.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.739
Brian:
I'll spare you the bullshit.

14:38.843 --> 14:41.259
It's been a tough preseason.

14:41.363 --> 14:44.193
I know you've worked hard,
but in the last couple of weeks,

14:44.297 --> 14:48.094
I think it's fair to say we've
still got a long way to go.

14:48.197 --> 14:50.130
Which is why I've decided

14:50.234 --> 14:52.339
we're heading back to camp
tomorrow morning.

14:52.443 --> 14:53.858
Is that normal?
No.

14:53.962 --> 14:55.239
Brian:
If you've got questions...

14:55.342 --> 14:56.896
I said the boys
would be at the launch.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.207
They're on
the press release.

14:58.311 --> 14:59.519
Bus leaves at 8:00.

14:59.622 --> 15:03.523
Oh, and...Connor had a few words
to say.

15:03.626 --> 15:06.457
I won't bore you
with the usual captain's spiel.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.390
Of course I support the call
to go back to camp.

15:08.493 --> 15:13.843
Uh, this is more
of a personal thing.

15:14.775 --> 15:16.225
Tahls and I are getting married.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.129
Whoo!

15:23.232 --> 15:25.269
You kept that a secret.

15:25.372 --> 15:27.685
I did.

15:27.788 --> 15:29.652
I mean, it's fucking nuts.

15:29.756 --> 15:31.482
But the Dogs did it
couple years back,

15:31.585 --> 15:33.449
and then they took home the flag
that year.

15:33.553 --> 15:34.588
Sounds good.

15:34.692 --> 15:36.487
Are you right?

15:36.590 --> 15:38.454
Yeah.
What's the deal with Tahlia?

15:38.558 --> 15:39.800
Tahlia?
Connor's girlfriend.

15:39.904 --> 15:41.561
The one with the stick
up her arse.

15:41.664 --> 15:44.184
What'd she do to you?Nothing. It's just a vibe.

15:44.288 --> 15:45.945
She's always been nice
to me.

15:46.048 --> 15:47.808
That's 'cause you've got
your cock goggles on.

15:47.912 --> 15:49.534
What?! No!
Oh, come on.

15:49.638 --> 15:51.226
She's hot.
Not my type.

15:51.329 --> 15:52.675
Oh, yeah?

15:53.814 --> 15:56.024
No. Nothing.
Does nothing for me.

15:56.127 --> 15:58.578
Your spank bank consists
of Mila Kunis, Tahlia Woods --

15:58.681 --> 16:00.442
No one uses spank banks
anymore.

16:00.545 --> 16:02.099
Well, what do you call it?

16:02.202 --> 16:04.618
The Internet?
It's ruined all imagination.

16:04.722 --> 16:06.379
You type in one innocent
little word --

16:06.482 --> 16:08.795
"tickle," "squat"...

16:08.898 --> 16:10.314
Well, they're dirty...."apple"...

16:10.417 --> 16:12.764
"Apple"?
Yeah.

16:12.868 --> 16:14.111
You want me
to demonstrate?

16:29.609 --> 16:31.507
I need
your birth certificate.

16:31.611 --> 16:33.475
Oh, it's in a box
somewhere.

16:33.578 --> 16:34.890
Can't I find it
when I get back?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.547
If you want to get married
this year,

16:36.650 --> 16:37.997
we're gonna have to move
quickly.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.343
Did you get on
to your mum?

16:39.446 --> 16:42.208
Still hiking in Bolivia.Oh, good!

16:42.311 --> 16:45.142
So she's gonna read about our
engagement on a Google alert.

16:45.245 --> 16:46.971
Why do you care so much?Why do you reckon?

16:47.075 --> 16:48.973
My family doesn't hate you.

16:49.077 --> 16:51.079
When you asked your mum
to spend time with me,

16:51.182 --> 16:52.804
she booked us
into a silent retreat.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.151
Uncle Mike likes you.

16:54.254 --> 16:56.049
Well, Uncle Mike's got
good taste.

16:56.153 --> 16:57.464
And if your mum gives me

16:57.568 --> 16:59.121
"Feminism For Dummies" again
for my birthday --

16:59.225 --> 17:01.227
She won't be invited
to the wedding.

17:09.821 --> 17:13.273
Travis: Oh. He hooks it.
Straight through the middle!

17:13.377 --> 17:14.343
Come out, boys!

17:14.447 --> 17:16.207
All right.

17:16.311 --> 17:17.967
Hey!
Hey.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.624
Hey, you want to play?
We could play two-player.

17:19.728 --> 17:21.523
No.
Are the kids in bed?

17:21.626 --> 17:23.421
Uh...on it.

17:23.525 --> 17:24.629
Hang on. Hang on.
Wait.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.045
What?

17:26.148 --> 17:29.669
So, David wants to have
a lunch meeting tomorrow.

17:31.395 --> 17:33.017
They're gonna offer you
partner.

17:33.121 --> 17:34.053
I think so.

17:34.156 --> 17:35.985
Course they fucking are!

17:36.089 --> 17:37.470
I mean...

17:37.573 --> 17:39.748
Ah!
It's okay.

17:39.851 --> 17:43.821
Um, we could ask Luce to do
a few more days with the kids.

17:43.924 --> 17:46.479
Or Mum could come over
a bit more.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.688
Yeah. I mean, we could just
send them to boarding school.

17:48.791 --> 17:52.312
Maybe overseas. The Swiss Alps?
Somewhere really remote.

17:52.416 --> 17:54.176
Is that what you want?
No.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.316
We agreed we're not gonna
outsource our kids.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.698
No. This isn't outsourcing.
We're accepting help.

17:58.801 --> 18:00.458
It's like buying a car
with power steering

18:00.562 --> 18:01.839
or a government bailout.

18:01.942 --> 18:03.254
Not the same.

18:03.358 --> 18:05.463
Plus I'm not playing.
I-I got heaps more time.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.809
You're still coaching
at the club.

18:06.913 --> 18:09.398
Look, this was our deal.

18:09.502 --> 18:12.367
I retire.
You go full throttle.

18:12.470 --> 18:14.748
I promise.

18:14.852 --> 18:17.268
I got you.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.373
You got me?

18:19.408 --> 18:21.479
I got...you.

18:21.583 --> 18:24.586
Okay. You have got to stop
watching those hip-hop videos.

18:24.689 --> 18:25.725
But...
No.

18:25.828 --> 18:27.899
Mm?
No.

19:26.889 --> 19:29.133
Yeah, right.

19:31.549 --> 19:36.968
When I was a kid...
I wanted to be a train driver.

19:37.072 --> 19:38.384
Yeah?

19:38.487 --> 19:40.040
More information, please.

19:40.144 --> 19:42.802
Well, they go fast,
they drive on tracks.

19:42.905 --> 19:44.010
What's not to love?

19:44.113 --> 19:45.598
I was gonna be a fireman.

19:45.701 --> 19:50.258
Ooh. See, that's unfair.
You know I love uniforms.

19:50.361 --> 19:52.950
Well, if the whole coaching
thing doesn't work out...

19:53.053 --> 19:55.090
We could be partners.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.886
Mm.
Matching outfits.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.301
Thanks.

19:59.405 --> 20:02.339
But I prefer to work
alone.

20:06.895 --> 20:09.346
I could do next Wednesday.

20:09.449 --> 20:10.864
Ah. Wednesday.

20:10.968 --> 20:13.212
No, I can't.
I've got a charity thing.

20:13.315 --> 20:14.558
Week after?

20:14.661 --> 20:16.456
I'm gonna have to
play it by ear.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.837
I'm sorry.

20:17.940 --> 20:19.701
Lachie mentioned something
about coming home.

20:19.804 --> 20:21.910
So we're looking at three weeks
again.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.395
If nothing shifts, yeah.

20:28.606 --> 20:30.125
What's this?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.334
Oh, you know how every time
we're together, you...

20:32.438 --> 20:33.611
I pay.

20:33.715 --> 20:34.957
I was thinking we could stop
doing that.

20:35.061 --> 20:37.408
So you don't want me
as the client anymore?

20:37.512 --> 20:38.754
There's more between us
than that.

20:38.858 --> 20:40.756
Adam...I know you have your rules.

20:40.860 --> 20:41.964
I'm not asking you to break them
for me.

20:42.068 --> 20:43.966
Aren't you?

20:44.070 --> 20:46.383
I do not understand you
at all.

20:46.486 --> 20:49.386
Well, that's the beauty of this.
You don't have to.

20:59.327 --> 21:00.535
Dan?

21:00.638 --> 21:03.020
Daniel: Just packing.
Bus is going in 20.

21:03.123 --> 21:05.056
What's with the dresses?

21:05.160 --> 21:07.058
Hang on!

21:12.443 --> 21:14.825
What the fuck?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.035
What are you doing?

21:18.138 --> 21:19.485
Nothing.
What's this about?

21:19.588 --> 21:21.245
Oh, Tahlia sent 'em.

21:21.349 --> 21:23.005
Tahlia?Yeah. There was a note.

21:23.109 --> 21:24.317
Something about a launch.

21:28.666 --> 21:30.634
You off?

21:30.737 --> 21:33.050
Yeah.

21:33.153 --> 21:34.672
What?

21:34.776 --> 21:37.503
I know what you're gonna say,
but...I want you to take this.

21:37.606 --> 21:39.298
I don't need money from you.
I'm getting a job.

21:39.401 --> 21:40.782
Well, till then --
for emergencies.

21:40.885 --> 21:44.268
I'm not gonna use it.Just...Just...take it.

21:48.514 --> 21:49.791
Good luck
with the interview.

21:49.894 --> 21:51.586
Make sure you let me know
how it all goes.

21:51.689 --> 21:52.863
Mm.

21:57.764 --> 22:02.459
Oh, by the way, that dress --
You'd nail it.

22:11.640 --> 22:14.643
Brian: In here, babe.
Have you seen my charger?

22:14.747 --> 22:16.645
Top drawer.

22:19.510 --> 22:21.305
How was your night?

22:21.409 --> 22:22.755
Good.
Yours?

22:22.858 --> 22:25.309
Yeah.
Can't complain.

22:29.900 --> 22:31.695
Look, I know you think this camp
is a mistake,

22:31.798 --> 22:33.386
but I don't know
what else to do.

22:33.490 --> 22:36.596
Right, they're not gelling,
they're not a team.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.080
Well,
they have to meet you,

22:38.184 --> 22:40.151
and you have to trust
that they can do it.

22:40.255 --> 22:42.084
They don't believe I can
get 'em back to the Grand Final.

22:42.188 --> 22:43.534
It's not your fault.

22:43.638 --> 22:46.744
You didn't give away
that 50-minute penalty.

22:49.782 --> 22:51.197
Man on radio:
We're all disappointed

22:51.300 --> 22:52.405
with the Southern Jets.

22:52.509 --> 22:54.373
How do you play off
in a Grand Final

22:54.476 --> 22:56.651
and have preseason form
as ordinary as this?

22:56.754 --> 22:59.067
We've got Darren from Doncaster
on the line to weigh in.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.862
Darren, what do you think?

23:00.965 --> 23:02.795
Darren: Brian Rickards
and Andrew MacLeish reckon

23:02.898 --> 23:05.798
no one inside the club blames
Davies for his brain snap,

23:05.901 --> 23:07.869
but the way they're playing,
it's a bloody disgrace.

23:07.972 --> 23:09.249
Man on radio:
Yeah, there's no cohesion.

23:09.353 --> 23:11.044
The players aren't talking
to each other.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.951
Kath:
Hey, gorgeous.

23:21.054 --> 23:22.262
It's fine.

23:22.366 --> 23:23.747
I spoke to my publicist,

23:23.850 --> 23:25.818
and she says that it's gonna be
okay without the boys.

23:25.921 --> 23:27.129
Well, I'm not surprised.

23:27.233 --> 23:28.027
So, who is coming?

23:28.130 --> 23:30.685
Maddy, Jessie, you...

23:30.788 --> 23:32.756
Paige?

23:32.859 --> 23:36.069
Kath, I don't know what else
you want me to do, okay?

23:36.173 --> 23:37.761
I did what you asked.
I tried.

23:37.864 --> 23:40.902
I even sent her
some options.

23:41.005 --> 23:43.042
Options?
Okay. I...

23:43.145 --> 23:44.664
I know where your head's at,
but I promise you,

23:44.768 --> 23:46.839
it is not the same
as last time.

23:46.942 --> 23:48.772
I didn't know
what Georgie's size was.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.498
And I'm pretty sure
that I felt Paige out

23:50.601 --> 23:52.154
and she's definitely a 10.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.674
A Country Road 10.

23:58.885 --> 24:03.027
Kath:
Can you be at my place at 2:00?

24:03.131 --> 24:05.789
You are talking to a woman
who just made partner.

24:05.892 --> 24:07.825
Oh, Maddy!
Congratulations.

24:07.929 --> 24:10.828
About bloody time too.

24:10.932 --> 24:12.243
I am about to buy myself
something

24:12.347 --> 24:13.866
that I don't even know
that I want yet,

24:13.969 --> 24:15.592
that the kids can't break --
within budget.

24:15.695 --> 24:17.386
So whatever you've got going on
at your place

24:17.490 --> 24:19.250
needs to be bigger than that.

24:19.354 --> 24:23.703
Let me put it this way.
Tahlia sent Paige some dresses.

24:23.807 --> 24:27.776
What is wrong with her?
Why does she keep doing that?

24:30.814 --> 24:33.437
I think it's important kids
have a sense of community

24:33.541 --> 24:36.060
and support, no matter
what academic level they are at.

24:36.164 --> 24:38.615
Uh, I had a teacher
who helped me when I was a kid.

24:38.718 --> 24:41.859
She put in a real effort at my
school, made a big difference.

24:41.963 --> 24:43.896
And she's the reason
I wanted to become a teacher.

24:43.999 --> 24:46.208
You are enthusiastic,
excited.

24:46.312 --> 24:48.038
I can tell you've never taught
full time.

24:48.141 --> 24:49.591
I've done a lot of pracs.

24:49.695 --> 24:52.145
A kid took a crap
on my car bonnet last week.

24:52.249 --> 24:53.353
Broad daylight.

24:53.457 --> 24:54.976
I bet you never
thought of that

24:55.079 --> 24:56.771
when you decided to become
a teacher.

24:56.874 --> 24:59.152
Uh, my -- my last prac
was at Casterton High.

24:59.256 --> 25:01.396
Uh, they offered me
a full-time position.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.571
Um, but I had to
turn them down.

25:03.674 --> 25:04.951
Why?

25:05.055 --> 25:06.574
Oh, 'cause I moved
to Melbourne.

25:06.677 --> 25:07.954
Why did you move
to Melbourne?

25:08.058 --> 25:09.369
For the experience.

25:09.473 --> 25:10.957
I've never -- never taught
in the city before.

25:11.061 --> 25:15.479
So you opted for experience
over a full-time job?

25:15.583 --> 25:17.723
Yeah. And -- And my boyfriend
got a job here.

25:19.138 --> 25:21.796
It-- It's not just any job.He's saving the world, is he?

25:21.899 --> 25:24.661
No, no. He, um, plays football
for the Southern Jets.

25:24.764 --> 25:26.076
Ah.

25:26.179 --> 25:28.181
You're going out
with one of the new recruits?

25:28.285 --> 25:30.149
Yeah. Yeah.
You follow the footy?

25:30.252 --> 25:32.531
I've been barracking for the
Southern Jets since I was a kid.

25:32.634 --> 25:34.360
Lifetime member.

25:34.463 --> 25:36.327
Have you met Connor Marrello
and Tahlia?

25:36.431 --> 25:38.226
What are they like?They seem really nice.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.953
I knew it.
Course they are.

25:41.056 --> 25:42.126
Man:
Getting back to the interview.

25:42.230 --> 25:44.163
Yes!
Sorry.

25:44.266 --> 25:47.546
Your résumé seems adequate
for someone your age,

25:47.649 --> 25:49.306
but most teachers
starting at this school

25:49.409 --> 25:51.998
start in the same place --
the casuals pool.

25:52.102 --> 25:54.035
Even then it can take a while
to get days.

25:54.138 --> 25:55.864
Don't you think
we can find something?

25:55.968 --> 25:57.210
Don't think so.

25:57.314 --> 25:58.487
You could take
Jim's classes!

25:58.591 --> 26:00.144
What?

26:00.248 --> 26:03.078
Well, you're always saying
that your plate's too full,

26:03.182 --> 26:05.287
being vice principal
and trying to teach.

26:05.391 --> 26:07.496
It'll only be a couple of days
a week, but what do you think?

26:07.600 --> 26:10.051
Yes! Oh, thank you!

26:10.154 --> 26:12.709
Thank you so much.

26:12.812 --> 26:14.503
Okay!

26:14.607 --> 26:16.436
I won't let you down.

26:18.922 --> 26:20.164
Mm.

26:22.477 --> 26:23.478
Hello?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.617
What are you doing
right now?

26:24.721 --> 26:26.481
Kath?
You have my number?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.829
The girls and I are gonna take
you shopping for the launch.

26:29.933 --> 26:32.349
Oh.
That sounds really nice.

26:32.452 --> 26:33.419
I-I can't make it.

26:33.522 --> 26:34.765
What, are you busy?

26:34.869 --> 26:36.111
Yeah, I've got --
I've got plans

26:36.215 --> 26:37.561
with, um,
work colleagues.

26:37.665 --> 26:40.357
I think I just got a job
teaching at a school,

26:40.460 --> 26:42.290
and, um, they want to
take me out to celebrate.

26:42.393 --> 26:45.017
So we're gonna go to one
of those fancy restaurants

26:45.120 --> 26:48.330
with like 10 courses and they
take them out really slowly.

26:48.434 --> 26:50.125
So, um, it'll -- it'll probably
be quite late...

26:50.229 --> 26:52.196
Paige?

26:52.300 --> 26:54.405
Can I give you
a word of advice?

26:54.509 --> 26:55.821
Sure.

26:55.924 --> 26:57.788
Don't talk so much
when you lie.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.791
Uh, where shall I meet you?

27:06.072 --> 27:07.453
Now, can I get you a drink?

27:07.556 --> 27:09.420
We've got pretty much
everything -- wine, spirits...

27:09.524 --> 27:11.319
Bourbon and Coke?

27:11.422 --> 27:13.390
Maddy: Hi. We're here already.

27:13.493 --> 27:16.496
Look, I know
we've only just met,

27:16.600 --> 27:19.361
but I also know how important
you are to Daniel.

27:19.465 --> 27:21.156
And if he has the kind
of breakout season

27:21.260 --> 27:24.194
we're all hoping he'll have
you need to be prepared.

27:24.297 --> 27:25.885
For what?

27:25.989 --> 27:28.508
This.
Life in the spotlight.

27:28.612 --> 27:30.994
Look, don't get me wrong.
There are lots of perks.

27:31.097 --> 27:32.823
But there's also
a lot of pressure.

27:32.927 --> 27:35.515
You're about to have every inch
of your life scrutinized,

27:35.619 --> 27:37.172
and we want you
to be prepared.

27:40.072 --> 27:42.108
I've got a car waiting.
You ready to go?

27:42.212 --> 27:44.041
Almost.

27:45.525 --> 27:48.218
I didn't mean to offend you --
with the dresses.

27:48.321 --> 27:51.773
Oh, no. They were lovely.
It's just I don't look like you.

27:51.877 --> 27:54.534
No one looks like Tahlia.
Sorry.

27:54.638 --> 27:57.296
The only reason I look like this
is because of Botox.

27:57.399 --> 27:58.538
And Fraxel.

27:58.642 --> 28:00.230
There's nothing wrong
with your face.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.369
Well, it's preventative.

28:01.472 --> 28:02.957
You also do cryotherapy,
laser...

28:03.060 --> 28:04.061
Jessie:
Threading.

28:04.165 --> 28:05.269
Maddy: Colonics.
Fillers.

28:05.373 --> 28:07.237
No, I don't.
This is natural.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.032
Really?
Your cheeks?

28:09.135 --> 28:11.310
Genetics.I hate you.

28:11.413 --> 28:15.245
Okay. I don't understand
most of what you just said.

28:15.348 --> 28:16.695
Is colonics the one
where you...

28:16.798 --> 28:18.110
That's the one.
Yes.

28:18.213 --> 28:19.801
Yeah. No.
I don't want to do that.

28:19.905 --> 28:22.045
Great. Well, we've got that
sorted, then.

28:28.051 --> 28:32.641
♪ I'll take a whiskey neat,
chase it with a gin and juice ♪

28:32.745 --> 28:37.060
♪ I just can't control my feet
when I get a little bit loose ♪

28:37.163 --> 28:39.683
♪ Step aside ♪ Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah

28:39.787 --> 28:42.203
♪ Nah-nah, nah-nah, oh, yeah

28:42.306 --> 28:44.067
♪ Step aside I love this!

28:44.170 --> 28:45.585
Kath:
Hey?

28:45.689 --> 28:49.141
Mm, I don't know if that'll work
with her shape.

28:49.244 --> 28:51.488
T-Tahlia, I can't afford this.Don't think about it.

28:51.591 --> 28:52.938
I have to pay for it.

28:53.041 --> 28:55.043
Even then.Maddy: Oh!

28:56.804 --> 28:58.564
Oh.
Oh, I love that!

28:58.667 --> 28:59.841
I've got that in blue.

28:59.945 --> 29:02.741
This plus your boobs
equals whatever you want

29:02.844 --> 29:04.363
for the rest of your life
with Daniel.

29:04.466 --> 29:06.641
Yeah. I-I can just get underwear
from Kmart.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.815
Or somewhere that doesn't
charge...

29:07.918 --> 29:10.024
$265.It goes under your clothes.

29:10.127 --> 29:11.715
You can't even see it.

29:11.819 --> 29:14.028
This is a good start.

29:18.895 --> 29:21.656
Okay. I don't know how, but
you're taking up all the room.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.968
I'm on the edge.Shove.

29:23.071 --> 29:24.176
She's been in there
a very long time.

29:24.279 --> 29:25.764
Should I go
and check on her?

29:25.867 --> 29:27.558
No. She's not ready
for you to see her naked yet.

29:27.662 --> 29:28.974
It took me years
to work up to that.

29:29.077 --> 29:31.597
What's she wearing?My favorite was the Dior.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.012
Paige, are you okay?

29:33.116 --> 29:35.394
Paige:
Yep. I'm almost ready.

29:35.497 --> 29:36.498
Have you got the shoes?

29:36.602 --> 29:38.190
Wearing them.Good. Come on.

29:45.749 --> 29:46.992
This I love.

29:48.303 --> 29:49.788
Who picked that?

29:49.891 --> 29:50.789
I did.

29:50.892 --> 29:53.101
It's very...elegant.Classic.

29:53.205 --> 29:54.965
I love that.It's boring.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.935
I like the shoes.
With the right accessories...

29:59.038 --> 30:01.006
Exactly. I can dress it up,
I can dress it down.

30:01.109 --> 30:02.870
And it's not that expensive.

30:02.973 --> 30:05.355
Listen, I know it's all
a little bit steep,

30:05.458 --> 30:07.012
but consider it
an investment,

30:07.115 --> 30:09.324
a chance to make a statement,
build a profile.

30:09.428 --> 30:10.878
I don't want a profile.

30:10.981 --> 30:12.396
Well, you're gonna have to make
this lifestyle work

30:12.500 --> 30:13.639
on a teacher's salary.
Tahls.

30:13.742 --> 30:15.434
What?Not everyone's you, darling.

30:15.537 --> 30:17.022
Look, I'm just saying
with the right profile

30:17.125 --> 30:19.541
you'd be able to get
most of this stuff for free.

30:19.645 --> 30:21.233
Why would people give you stuff
for free?

30:21.336 --> 30:23.304
Look, I'll give you
a head start.

30:23.407 --> 30:25.962
Um, go in there,
put on something decent,

30:26.065 --> 30:27.722
and I will post a photo
of us.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.689
What's your handle?Oh, I don't -- I don't have one.

30:29.793 --> 30:32.002
What?
I mean, I did.

30:32.106 --> 30:33.521
I just deleted it

30:33.624 --> 30:36.110
because it was taking up
too much room on my phone.

30:36.213 --> 30:37.697
Okay. I don't know what to do
with that.

30:37.801 --> 30:40.252
Right. That's it. I'm off.
I am buying this.

30:40.355 --> 30:41.909
If you have to think too hard
about anything,

30:42.012 --> 30:43.013
you probably don't even want it.

30:43.117 --> 30:44.428
Buy everything else.

30:44.532 --> 30:46.051
Paige: Look, I know
you're trying to help.

30:46.154 --> 30:48.398
But I'm Daniel's girlfriend.
That's it.

30:48.501 --> 30:50.883
I'm not interested in becoming,
like, a WAG.

30:50.987 --> 30:52.885
Not -- Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

30:52.989 --> 30:55.474
It's just...you've all got
so much going on for you.

30:55.577 --> 30:58.063
You're smart,
successful women.

30:58.166 --> 31:01.135
Tahlia, you're much more
than just Connor's girlfriend.

31:01.238 --> 31:02.446
I'm his fiancée.

31:02.550 --> 31:04.552
Exactly.

31:04.655 --> 31:07.486
Right. You buy the dress.
I'm getting you the shoes.

31:07.589 --> 31:09.005
I can't let you do that.

31:09.108 --> 31:11.939
No. I insist.
Honestly, consider it a gift.

31:12.042 --> 31:14.631
A-A "welcome to the club."

31:16.288 --> 31:18.428
No, no. You're right.
I should get the shoes.

31:18.531 --> 31:22.018
And the dress.
And that, um, top skirt.

31:22.121 --> 31:23.847
It's a top.

31:23.951 --> 31:25.538
Exactly. Versatile.
That's why I like it.

31:25.642 --> 31:27.644
I should get a few things,
actually. Yep.

31:31.544 --> 31:34.099
What's the damage?
Actually, don't tell me.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.381
Daniel: Hi. This is Dan.
You know what to do.

31:40.484 --> 31:42.279
You're busy.

31:42.383 --> 31:44.109
Or they've confiscated
your phone.

31:44.212 --> 31:46.145
They're probably bugging it
right now.

31:46.249 --> 31:48.734
Um...I've done something stupid,
and I --

31:48.837 --> 31:50.011
Woman:
Thank you.

31:50.115 --> 31:52.255
Your message has been sent
as a text.

31:52.358 --> 31:54.705
Yep. Okay.

31:55.775 --> 31:57.674
Paige.

31:57.777 --> 32:00.780
Hey.
Look, that was weird.

32:00.884 --> 32:02.403
I'm sorry.
I-I wanted to check --

32:02.506 --> 32:04.301
Are you okay?
Fine.

32:04.405 --> 32:06.096
Look, you know this is a test,
right?

32:06.200 --> 32:07.235
A test?

32:07.339 --> 32:08.512
Yeah.
It's nothing personal.

32:08.616 --> 32:10.066
She does it
with all the new girls.

32:10.169 --> 32:13.172
It's kind of like
risk assessment.

32:13.276 --> 32:15.830
It makes sense when you know
where Tahls has come from.

32:17.073 --> 32:19.661
She sent you a bunch of
offensively small dresses too?

32:19.765 --> 32:22.595
Mate, I was pregnant with JJ
at the time.

32:22.699 --> 32:24.735
There were a lot of parts of me
that were never gonna fit

32:24.839 --> 32:26.945
into a strapless gown.

32:27.048 --> 32:29.361
Tahlia can be tricky,
but stick with her.

32:29.464 --> 32:32.122
Once she figures you out, she's
actually a pretty decent person.

32:32.226 --> 32:34.883
I think I name-dropped Dan
to get a job.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.506
That's nothing.

32:36.609 --> 32:38.128
Wait till you have to get a kid
into day care.

32:49.898 --> 32:52.487
Shit, Connor.
One job.

32:53.730 --> 32:55.594
Two jobs.

33:09.228 --> 33:10.436
Yes.

33:16.546 --> 33:19.100
What the fuck, Connor?

33:22.207 --> 33:24.278
Man on radio: The Southern
Jets'
preseason form

33:24.381 --> 33:26.728
has copped pretty of criticism,
and for good reason.

33:26.832 --> 33:28.868
But going back to camp
this close to the season

33:28.972 --> 33:32.286
is a bold move from Rickards,
with a lot of people asking,

33:32.389 --> 33:34.840
how bad are things
at this embattled club?

33:38.533 --> 33:41.329
Hey.
What the fuck was that?

33:41.433 --> 33:43.090
What the fuck
was that about?

33:47.577 --> 33:49.130
Get off him, Jack!

33:49.234 --> 33:50.511
Man: Hey. Hey. Hey.
Break it up. Easy.

33:50.614 --> 33:51.753
Fuck!

33:51.857 --> 33:53.134
Man: Hey. Hey. Hey!
Break it up!

33:53.238 --> 33:54.480
Break it up, Jack!

33:54.584 --> 33:57.000
Back out!

33:57.104 --> 33:59.106
Oi.

33:59.209 --> 34:00.728
What's that about?

34:00.831 --> 34:02.557
Couldn't tell you.

34:02.661 --> 34:04.835
Man:
Oi! Back on it!

34:09.116 --> 34:12.429
Two at a time, you run
cross-country to the river.

34:12.533 --> 34:15.225
Paddle 3 K's upstream,
shoulder your kayak,

34:15.329 --> 34:18.056
run back to the beginning
and do it all again.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.781
You start in pairs,

34:19.885 --> 34:24.096
staggered intervals,
and you finish in pairs.

34:24.200 --> 34:28.031
Rusty, you're with Jack.

34:29.274 --> 34:31.931
You two, sort your shit out.

35:04.205 --> 35:05.896
I'll find the girls.
Yeah.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.174
Woman:
Tahlia!

35:09.314 --> 35:11.109
Woman:
Over here, Tahlia.

35:16.942 --> 35:20.221
Name?
Uh, Paige Dunkeley.

35:20.325 --> 35:23.811
Paige!If you could just keep moving.

35:23.914 --> 35:26.227
Oh, it's just my mates.Yeah. They'll see you in there.

35:28.609 --> 35:31.163
Uh, any suggestions?

35:31.267 --> 35:32.992
Man: Most people put their hands
on their hips.

35:33.096 --> 35:36.168
Helpful. Thank you.

35:36.272 --> 35:38.688
We should get in there.

35:38.791 --> 35:40.793
Hey.
How you going?

35:40.897 --> 35:44.176
I'm sweating between my boobs,
so that can't be good.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.453
Just a three-quarter turn.

35:45.557 --> 35:48.076
Shoulders back
and head over the fence.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.630
What?

35:49.733 --> 35:52.115
Three-quarter turn,
shoulders back, over the fence.

35:52.219 --> 35:55.118
Now say "prune."

35:55.222 --> 35:57.085
Prune.
Prune.

35:57.189 --> 36:01.849
So, tag, tweet, share, enjoy.

36:01.952 --> 36:05.439
And be part of the Tahlia
by Tahlia Woods journey.

36:05.542 --> 36:07.372
Thank you so much for coming.

36:07.475 --> 36:08.752
Yeah!

36:09.891 --> 36:11.410
Did we miss it?

36:11.514 --> 36:12.791
No.
That was it.

36:12.894 --> 36:14.965
The media wall is basically
the whole event.

36:15.069 --> 36:16.691
Now we drink.

36:26.011 --> 36:27.702
Hey.

36:32.397 --> 36:33.950
What's going on?

36:34.053 --> 36:35.710
Mm.
Nothing.

36:36.746 --> 36:39.300
Come here.
Don't move.

36:42.855 --> 36:45.962
Do you think you know everything
about Brian?

36:46.065 --> 36:47.998
Uh, I don't know.

36:48.102 --> 36:49.793
But you share a life together.
You trust him.

36:49.897 --> 36:51.001
Yeah, of course.

36:51.105 --> 36:52.658
I went through
Connor's stuff today,

36:52.762 --> 36:56.144
and I found out
that he's adopted.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.388
Oh.

36:58.492 --> 36:59.872
You knew?

36:59.976 --> 37:01.219
I was there
when he signed up.

37:01.322 --> 37:02.875
Look, I thought he would've
told you by now.

37:02.979 --> 37:05.223
He knows everything
about me.

37:05.326 --> 37:07.570
He knows that when I went
to school

37:07.673 --> 37:09.123
I-I kissed a boy
for lunch money,

37:09.227 --> 37:11.298
he knows that my stepdad
kicked me out when I was 16,

37:11.401 --> 37:13.403
and he didn't tell me this?

37:13.507 --> 37:15.336
I mean, why doesn't he want me
to know who he is?

37:15.440 --> 37:16.820
Tahlia?

37:16.924 --> 37:18.753
We've got a couple more brothers
to see.

37:18.857 --> 37:20.376
Yeah.
Just one minute.

37:20.479 --> 37:24.103
Hey, I'm sure Connor has
his reasons

37:24.207 --> 37:27.590
and none of them
are about you, okay?

37:27.693 --> 37:30.144
Has he met
his birth mother?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.663
I don't know.

37:33.181 --> 37:36.115
I bet you fucking love me.

37:43.606 --> 37:47.679
500 to go!
Push it, Fletcher!

37:52.511 --> 37:54.133
Jack!

37:54.237 --> 37:56.274
Oi!

37:57.275 --> 37:58.206
Where's Jack?

37:58.310 --> 37:59.725
Connor:
What happened?

38:08.907 --> 38:12.428
Ladies, how are you?
Having a good time?

38:12.531 --> 38:13.843
Woman: Fine.Great!

38:13.946 --> 38:14.947
Mm!

38:15.051 --> 38:16.155
Tahlia?

38:16.259 --> 38:17.881
Hi.
Got a sec?

38:17.985 --> 38:19.952
I won't be a moment.

38:20.056 --> 38:20.919
Sure.

38:21.022 --> 38:22.541
I know what you're doing.

38:22.645 --> 38:24.612
What?
With the dresses.

38:24.716 --> 38:26.580
I get it's not personal
and you do it to everyone,

38:26.683 --> 38:27.926
but it still
doesn't make it okay,

38:28.029 --> 38:31.136
so...I'm asking you to stop,
please.

38:31.239 --> 38:33.552
I know it probably doesn't seem
like it,

38:33.656 --> 38:35.899
but I'm actually
trying to help you.

38:36.003 --> 38:37.763
At the end of the day,
everybody's gonna treat you

38:37.867 --> 38:38.971
like you're here
to be judged.

38:39.075 --> 38:41.422
That's not fair.
I know that.

38:41.526 --> 38:43.286
That's why I'm just trying to
protect you.

38:44.977 --> 38:47.083
Oh, and I hit on Daniel.

38:47.186 --> 38:49.810
It was all part of the test,
obviously.

38:49.913 --> 38:51.121
How'd he go?

38:51.225 --> 38:53.296
He passed.

38:54.435 --> 38:56.541
You're lucky, aren't you?

39:08.035 --> 39:10.037
Dan!
Where are you?

39:10.140 --> 39:12.039
Daniel:

39:12.142 --> 39:14.524
Dan, you -- you there?

39:14.628 --> 39:16.457
Well, I-I can't hear you.

39:16.561 --> 39:20.185
Paige?
Paige -- Paige, can you hear me?

39:20.288 --> 39:22.152
Oh, wait. I got you.
Don't move. Stay there.

39:22.256 --> 39:25.466
I don't know what's happened.

39:25.570 --> 39:28.814
I should have stopped.

39:28.918 --> 39:32.611
We were in water,
and they were ahead, and then...

39:32.715 --> 39:33.578
Are you okay?

39:33.681 --> 39:36.235
Jack!
