12:53.314 --> 12:57.193
[Weaver]  We have a man who has now
been charged with multiple crimes,

12:57.276 --> 13:01.071
fled the United States, abandoning
all his followers by the way,

13:01.155 --> 13:02.781
he was aware of the charge

13:02.865 --> 13:05.743
and was getting out the United States
before he got caught.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.997
The best precaution was to detain him,
return him to Oregon,

13:10.080 --> 13:11.665
and begin to deal with
the prosecution there.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.083
That's what we're preparing for.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.919
[male reporter] What do you think
was the strength of your case?

13:15.002 --> 13:17.463
Well, the strength of our case
clearly was the fact

13:17.546 --> 13:21.550
that three days after a sealed indictment
was returned by the grand jury,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.136
he leaves the ranch
for the first time in four years

13:24.220 --> 13:26.347
and flies across country
in the middle of the night.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.473
[cameras clicking]

13:27.556 --> 13:30.434
[Weaver]  We were anticipating
a vigorous trial,

13:31.101 --> 13:33.229
and we had more evidence than we needed.

13:45.324 --> 13:50.246
[Sheela]  I was arrested,
and we were brought to the nearest prison.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.791
All three were housed in the same room.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.709
Me,

13:55.793 --> 13:56.752
Puja,

13:56.835 --> 13:58.462
and Shanti Bhadra.

13:58.546 --> 14:03.092
There were so many journalists
around this prison.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.303
[chatter in German]

14:08.430 --> 14:13.018
These German police guys
were pulling out photos of me

14:13.102 --> 14:15.354
and I had to autograph them.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.023
It was bizarre.

14:18.107 --> 14:24.613
The moment the German authorities
had left the room, the handcuffs went on.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.116
The leg chains went on.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.828
The German police handed us over

14:30.911 --> 14:35.875
to American authorities
to take us to America.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.004
[male reporter]  Shanti Bhadra arrived on
a commercial airlines flight from Chicago,

14:40.087 --> 14:42.423
and she'll spend the night
at the Downtown Justice Center.

14:42.506 --> 14:46.385
Also due in tonight, Anand Sheela,
Bhagwan's former personal secretary.

14:47.052 --> 14:50.306
[male reporter]  By the time she arrived
at a dark and foggy Portland airport,

14:50.389 --> 14:51.348
she was handcuffed,

14:51.432 --> 14:54.643
but still managed to smile for the crowd
of photographers clustered above.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.315
[man]
All right.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.321
-I'll see you back in just a little bit.
-Okay. Take care.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.072
-Okay.
-Bye-bye.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.034
This is the best lawyer in Portland.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.912
[female reporter]  Jon, she seemed to be
smiling a lot today.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.748
Do you really think she's enjoying
being back in the public eye?

15:15.831 --> 15:19.126
Well, you saw the smile on her face
as she went into the courthouse today.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.420
[cameras clicking]

15:21.503 --> 15:24.548
[Tuttle]  Nobody could be happy
being in Sheela's situation.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.343
Prosecutors have brought
her back to Oregon

15:27.426 --> 15:31.472
because they think they'll have her
staying here in prison for years to come.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.516
[female reporter]  Heavy security
surrounded the arrival in The Dalles

15:34.600 --> 15:38.646
of 38-year-old Ma Anand Puja
and 40-year-old Shanti Bhadra.

15:38.729 --> 15:43.108
They were arraigned in Wasco County
Circuit Court on attempted murder charges.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.530
[woman]
Good morning.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.199
-Thanks.
-[man] Very pretty.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.826
Did I tell you
I was going to be wearing tennies?

15:52.910 --> 15:57.164
[Gary]  By the time I sat down with Sheela,
she was in federal custody

15:57.247 --> 16:02.336
and agents brought her
and we spent an afternoon together.

16:02.419 --> 16:08.467
I was struck
by how small and unimposing she was

16:08.550 --> 16:12.596
because she'd been a pretty big figure

16:12.680 --> 16:16.767
in Oregon at the time
and frankly in my life.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.185
Um...

16:18.268 --> 16:22.064
And she was completely forthcoming,

16:22.147 --> 16:23.565
answered all of my questions.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.152
I believe she answered them
with complete honesty

16:27.236 --> 16:31.156
and with not the slightest trace
of shame or regret

16:31.240 --> 16:36.537
or, uh, anything reflecting remorse.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.663
Um...

16:38.163 --> 16:43.168
I left thinking this is a, um...

16:44.378 --> 16:49.174
This is a person with no empathy.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.511
[Frohnmayer]  Frankly, I'm convinced
the leadership of this group

16:52.594 --> 16:54.304
really believed they were above the law,

16:54.388 --> 16:56.432
that they could move faster than our law

16:56.515 --> 17:00.561
and that they could run circles around us
using our laws or breaking our laws.

17:00.644 --> 17:04.106
Uh... There was an arrogance about it
that's almost breathtaking.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.401
[cameras clicking]

17:07.484 --> 17:11.989
Much of what happened is monstrous,

17:12.072 --> 17:17.828
and if Sheela had spent
the rest of her life in jail,

17:17.911 --> 17:20.664
that wouldn't have seemed
like an excessive sentence.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.542
[indistinct chatter]

17:25.169 --> 17:26.003
[man]
No back-up?

17:26.086 --> 17:27.629
[man 2]
Okay, man, back-up.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.510
[Niren]
So, he's in jail in Charlotte.

17:35.137 --> 17:39.475
We were told he's going to go from
Charlotte on the next plane to Portland.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.563
[male reporter]  Rajneesh's zigzag trip
back to Oregon began here Monday night

17:44.646 --> 17:46.815
at the same airport
where he and six of his followers

17:46.899 --> 17:48.484
were arrested October 28th.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.111
Bhagwan was put aboard
a U.S. Marshal's jet.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.239
[male reporter]  Rajneesh left Charlotte,
North Carolina yesterday afternoon

17:54.323 --> 17:58.160
stopping in Missouri
before flying off to Oklahoma City.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.496
[female reporter]  Apparently officials
now say he is spending another night

18:00.579 --> 18:03.624
in Oklahoma City
at an undisclosed location.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.043
[male reporter]
He spent Tuesday and Wednesday nights

18:06.126 --> 18:07.711
at the El Reno Correction Institution.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.380
[female reporter]
His third jail in just nine days.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.925
[female reporter]
Where next for Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh?

18:13.008 --> 18:14.343
[male reporter]
As you said all week long,

18:14.426 --> 18:15.969
It's been something
of a cat and mouse game

18:16.053 --> 18:17.387
between federal marshals and reporters

18:17.471 --> 18:19.389
as the U.S. Marshals
have been deliberately vague

18:19.473 --> 18:21.683
about the exact time
and place of his arrival.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.394
They take as long as legally possible

18:24.478 --> 18:27.981
taking him from facility to facility,
bussing him around.

18:28.065 --> 18:34.279
What it gave them the opportunity to do is
drag him around the country for two weeks.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.406
I think it's a tragedy for this country...

18:37.699 --> 18:41.120
that this innocent and beautiful man...

18:42.663 --> 18:45.499
is being held in this country's prisons.

18:46.041 --> 18:50.337
You know, this country is not
that far from the Wild West, right?

18:51.755 --> 18:54.675
So they use every tool they have

18:54.758 --> 18:59.930
to try and coerce accused to give up.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.057
[camera clicking]

19:02.141 --> 19:06.353
They often refuse voluntary surrender
so they can get their perp walk.

19:07.354 --> 19:11.233
They like to arrest
and then put the person in the cuffs

19:11.316 --> 19:16.530
and make them walk through this barrage
of lights to make them look guilty.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.658
[man]  Well, to see a man
who's never hurt anyone

19:19.741 --> 19:22.744
shackled like a psychopathic killer...

19:23.787 --> 19:27.166
shows me that the United States government
is terrified of this man.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.293
[male reporter]
They persist in their belief that Bhagwan

19:29.376 --> 19:32.379
is being wrongly treated
and is becoming physically ill.

19:32.462 --> 19:36.550
Spokeswoman Prem Isabel called the case,
"government sponsored kidnapping."

19:36.633 --> 19:38.468
All I'm concerned
is with Bhagwan's health.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.679
I don't want the man to die in jail.

19:40.762 --> 19:45.642
That anyone could treat a man with
such grace and such beauty in that way,

19:45.726 --> 19:47.477
I just don't understand it.

19:47.561 --> 19:51.815
Uh... He is by no means being given
any special consideration

19:51.899 --> 19:54.234
or any red carpet treatment so to speak.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.571
I think our assumption was he probably
wouldn't like that bus ride.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.824
He probably wouldn't like his roommates.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.203
[Niren]  He was subsequently put
in a cell with an individual

20:04.286 --> 20:07.164
who was diagnosed
as having contagious herpes.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.415
Herpes.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.834
I think this is outrageous.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.169
[male reporter]
Charges of mistreatment.

20:12.252 --> 20:16.256
Three strip searches allegedly performed
by local corrections officers.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.674
[male reporter]
At 6:30 this morning,

20:17.758 --> 20:19.760
Bhagwan was put back
on the Marshal's plane.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.138
[male reporter]  From Tucson,
it was onto Vandenberg Air Force Base.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.391
From there,
it was a mid-afternoon stop in Sacramento.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.519
Each time that they told him
that he was going to go somewhere,

20:29.603 --> 20:32.689
they told him
that he was going to Portland.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.108
And each time,
it turned out not to be true.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.653
Richard, I understand
the U.S. Marshal is telling us

20:37.736 --> 20:40.489
that the plane has now landed
at Boeing Field in Seattle.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.157
That happened just a few minutes ago.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.910
Our information is
that Bhagwan will be transferred

20:44.993 --> 20:47.287
from that bigger airplane to a smaller one

20:47.371 --> 20:50.040
which will in fact bring him here
to the Portland air base.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.418
[Weaver]  Between the time
that he was arrested in Charlotte

20:53.502 --> 20:55.087
and he got back to Portland,

20:55.170 --> 20:57.673
I think it was almost three weeks.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.970
And as a result of that environment...

21:04.012 --> 21:05.681
he was ready to surrender.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.565
[male reporter]  Sheela,
Bhagwan's former personal secretary,

21:15.649 --> 21:18.402
back in Oregon
to face charges of attempted murder,

21:18.485 --> 21:21.113
first degree assault
and conspiracy to commit murder.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.951
[male reporter]  This time there was
no entourage of Rajneeshee supporters.

21:26.034 --> 21:29.663
Sheela came to the U.S. Courthouse
in Portland under heavy guard,

21:29.746 --> 21:32.124
virtually surrounded by federal marshals.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.835
[male reporter]
State authorities say

21:34.918 --> 21:37.170
she tried to poison
two Wasco County commissioners

21:37.254 --> 21:40.132
and tried to burn
down the Wasco County Planning Office.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.676
I thought if Sheela did all of this,

21:42.759 --> 21:47.973
it would be possible
for her to testify against Osho...

21:48.724 --> 21:51.059
avoid prosecution herself...

21:52.936 --> 21:56.606
and that Osho could be subject
to criminal prosecution.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.775
[camera clicking]

21:58.859 --> 22:04.656
[Sheela]  It was never a thought
in my mind to barter against Bhagwan

22:04.740 --> 22:06.658
or barter with anybody

22:06.742 --> 22:11.913
so that... I can avoid my misery.

22:13.123 --> 22:19.087
You cannot betray people
for their own freedom.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.797
[male reporter]
And some major developments tonight.

22:20.881 --> 22:25.343
Ma Anand Sheela appeared
in federal court today to plead guilty.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.721
[female reporter]  Sheela arrived
this morning to plead guilty

22:27.804 --> 22:31.391
to charges ranging
from mass poisonings to wiretappings.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.562
Sheela will serve the
four-and-one-half-year prison sentence,

22:35.645 --> 22:38.857
pay fines totaling $469,000

22:38.940 --> 22:41.610
and agree to leave the U.S.
after she is released.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.243
Ma Shanti Bhadra,
another former commune leader,

22:50.327 --> 22:52.746
pleaded guilty
to attempted murder of the doctor.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.831
She'll serve ten years in prison.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.668
[Jane]
It was decided

22:58.752 --> 23:03.632
that Sheela and I would serve
our sentences in a federal prison.

23:03.715 --> 23:08.678
The authorities felt it was better
for my safety not to be in Oregon.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.349
And so I, too, was sent
to the federal prison.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.644
It didn't get any better, I'm afraid.

23:16.269 --> 23:21.066
I truly believed
that I'd been locked into a mental asylum.

23:21.149 --> 23:25.737
People were screaming,
banging on the tin doors.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.989
It was pandemonium.

23:30.659 --> 23:36.206
Through all of that, my son Peter
still lived in Rajneeshpuram.

23:36.289 --> 23:39.960
And when I was in prison,
Peter came to visit me.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.088
That changed me.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.800
Because of all that had happened
around Rajneeshpuram,

23:46.883 --> 23:50.637
because of Bhagwan's attacks,
Peter asked me what had happened.

23:52.055 --> 23:56.393
The abandonment,
it was just awful for him...

23:57.519 --> 24:02.440
and very painful for me
to sit behind glass,

24:02.524 --> 24:07.988
to see the confusion
and the pain in my son's eyes.

24:08.864 --> 24:13.243
That was
when the first seed began to stir,

24:13.326 --> 24:16.663
the seed
that would take me away from Bhagwan.

24:16.746 --> 24:21.418
It was the beginning
of a very long journey...

24:22.794 --> 24:25.046
of breaking the spell.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.757
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh
will get his day in court.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.552
Richard Draper listened
as the lawyers argued over trial dates

24:30.635 --> 24:33.263
in the Rajneesh case,
now before a federal judge.

24:33.346 --> 24:36.183
And, Richard, was today's hearing
a preview of things to come?

24:36.266 --> 24:37.559
Oh, very much so, Mark.

24:37.642 --> 24:41.980
Legally, it promises to be
a tangled web made for lawyers.

24:43.273 --> 24:46.276
[Niren]
After Osho got back to Portland...

24:47.444 --> 24:52.199
myself and the rest of the lawyers
involved with his immigration case

24:52.282 --> 24:53.992
came out to talk to him.

24:54.826 --> 24:59.789
And I said, "These other men
are experts in this area of the law.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.041
Why don't we hear from them?"

25:02.292 --> 25:04.961
And all of them
basically said the same things.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.797
"You know this is
one of the weakest cases I've ever seen.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.635
I don't think I've ever seen a case
with this is little evidence

25:11.718 --> 25:14.512
that they've decided to prosecute."

25:14.596 --> 25:17.307
And Osho looked at me and said,
"Niren, what do you think?"

25:19.517 --> 25:20.518
And I said...

25:21.561 --> 25:25.440
[voice breaking]
"Number one, if you fight this,

25:25.523 --> 25:29.736
you'll have to spend about six weeks in
a federal court room every day, all day.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.364
And then you'll win.

25:32.989 --> 25:36.660
But even after you win,
if the United States government

25:36.743 --> 25:38.745
is prepared to do all of this

25:38.828 --> 25:42.666
to get you and to get this community,

25:43.500 --> 25:45.418
they're not going to stop.

25:45.502 --> 25:50.757
They will keep coming after you
until they get you.

25:50.840 --> 25:56.763
And so I recommend that you let us
negotiate a deal and that you leave."

25:56.846 --> 25:59.391
And Osho sat back as he always does.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.105
Sat for a few minutes and looked off.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.483
And then he said,
"If they will fight this--

26:08.566 --> 26:12.696
If they would fight this fairly,
I would go to the Supreme Court.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.785
[voice breaking]
But my body cannot sustain.

26:19.911 --> 26:24.624
My body cannot take
the things that it has--

26:24.708 --> 26:27.627
The things that it has been subjected to.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.005
Uh...

26:31.381 --> 26:33.174
Make a deal and I will leave."

26:40.724 --> 26:42.642
[male reporter]
In a dramatic turnaround today,

26:42.726 --> 26:45.895
Bhagwan came to Portland this afternoon
and went straight to the U.S. Courthouse.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.772
He was accompanied
by his team of four lawyers.

26:49.107 --> 26:52.110
[camera clicking]

26:52.193 --> 26:55.030
[Weaver]  In those days,
court artists drew pictures.

26:57.407 --> 27:02.704
There was a very strong presence
in that room of a dark aura.

27:04.080 --> 27:08.376
The Rajneeshees who had packed the court
room were sending that right up my spine.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.758
That courtroom artist,
who when it was over,

27:14.841 --> 27:18.845
had told me that the eeriness
that she felt in that courtroom

27:18.928 --> 27:23.016
was only akin
to one other experience she had

27:23.099 --> 27:25.810
where she was present
with the Ayatollah Khomeini.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.982
[male reporter]  A lot of surprises
in this local news day today.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.485
The biggest one occurred
just a couple of hours ago

27:33.568 --> 27:34.611
in federal court here in Portland.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.614
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh pleading guilty
to immigration fraud charges

27:37.697 --> 27:39.199
and agreeing to leave the country.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.744
[crowd shouting]

27:42.827 --> 27:44.704
[male reporter] Well, Mike and Shirley,
a remarkable scene

27:44.788 --> 27:45.747
here at the federal courthouse.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.000
U.S. Attorney Charles Turner
still being interviewed by reporters here

27:49.084 --> 27:50.502
following the plea agreement.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.380
A hearing this afternoon
before Judge Edward Levy.

27:53.463 --> 27:57.801
Bhagwan said, quote, "I never want
to return to the United States again."

28:00.512 --> 28:02.847
Now we're trying to get closer
to the U.S. Attorney Charles Turner,

28:02.931 --> 28:05.016
who is still making a statement
regarding the conclusion

28:05.100 --> 28:07.310
of this hearing this afternoon.
We'll see if we can get closer.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.771
[male reporter]
Can you tell us again? We missed this.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.357
-You guys got to be kidding.
-[male reporter] Yeah. I'm serious.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.652
I was very pleased
about the disposition of this case

28:15.735 --> 28:18.655
because I felt it was clearly
within the public interest.

28:18.738 --> 28:22.033
It vindicated the investigation
conducted by this office

28:22.117 --> 28:25.245
and it is a public concession of guilt
by Rajneesh.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.038
[female reporter] There are certainly
members of the public

28:27.122 --> 28:30.166
who really wanted to see this
go to a full-blown trial.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.584
Well, the defendant can't--

28:31.668 --> 28:34.587
We can't make a defendant go to trial
who wants to plead guilty.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.047
[reporter chuckles]

28:36.131 --> 28:37.382
All off these fellows

28:37.465 --> 28:41.469
have been involved in this operation
for at least four years,

28:41.553 --> 28:47.100
and this is a very satisfying
and successful conclusion to that process.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.561
Kathy, I'd like to ask
Mr. Turner a question. Is he still there?

28:49.644 --> 28:50.812
-Yes.
-Okay.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.564
Mr. Turner, let me ask you this.

28:52.647 --> 28:56.359
If you got what you wanted,
the Bhagwan's leaving the country,

28:56.443 --> 28:58.486
why didn't you just let him leave
in the first place,

28:58.570 --> 29:00.321
a couple of weeks ago that Sunday night?

29:00.405 --> 29:02.407
Well, that's not the way our system works.

29:02.490 --> 29:06.035
Somebody who had come here
and committed the nature of the crimes

29:06.119 --> 29:08.538
that were committed
by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh--

29:08.621 --> 29:14.294
To let him leave the country as a fugitive
and to abdicate our responsibilities

29:14.377 --> 29:16.337
simply would be inconsistent
with our oath of office.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.047
We simply could not do that.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.592
Uh... I would never have permitted that.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.552
The laws on our books are enacted

29:22.635 --> 29:27.223
in a democratic process
everyone participates in.

29:27.849 --> 29:31.728
There's not an exception in those statutes
that says you don't have to do that

29:31.811 --> 29:34.522
if you're smart enough to get away
before you get caught.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.817
And the citizens of this state
needed to see

29:37.901 --> 29:41.237
that the government
was going to hold him accountable

29:41.321 --> 29:43.114
like we would everybody else.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.329
[woman] That's far enough.
Give him some space, please.

29:49.412 --> 29:50.538
[male reporter] Who are you?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.874
-[woman] Please, give him some space.
-[male reporter] Who are you, lady?

29:52.957 --> 29:59.547
And that night, he got on a jet
and left the United States.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.302
None of his Sannyasins
will tell us where he's headed.

30:04.385 --> 30:07.806
There are probably
about ten or 12 Sannyasins on the plane.

30:07.889 --> 30:12.352
They've loaded the plane
with various pieces of luggage and boxes.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.726
[female reporter]
Before he got on the plane, he waved,

30:53.810 --> 30:56.855
put his hands together
in the traditional sign and smiled,

30:56.938 --> 30:58.773
and then turned and got on the plane.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.944
We don't know at this point
where the plane is headed.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.948
All we suspect is that the Bhagwan
is reportedly leaving the country.

31:23.965 --> 31:27.051
♪  You got kicked out late last night  ♪

31:27.594 --> 31:30.722
♪ On your throne, red-eye flight ♪

31:30.805 --> 31:36.436
♪ Bye-bye, Bhagwan ♪

31:38.646 --> 31:41.649
♪ Sold off every last Rolls Royce ♪

31:41.733 --> 31:45.236
♪  For your bail, had no choice  ♪

31:45.320 --> 31:50.867
♪ Bhagwan, bye-bye ♪

31:55.455 --> 31:58.625
I thought there was going to have to be
some acceptance from both sides

31:58.708 --> 32:00.835
and that's where we were headed.

32:00.919 --> 32:06.591
But then I got up one morning and it had
all blown up and it was leaving.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.551
-A big relief finally to get rid of them.
-I guess it was just a relief.

32:08.635 --> 32:12.305
-Just--
-Yeah. That's over. [chuckles]

32:12.388 --> 32:14.766
I'm elated about it. I really am.

32:14.849 --> 32:17.018
I'm glad that he's gone.
I hope he never returns.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.687
And I hope all these people
go right with him.

32:21.314 --> 32:24.609
When I heard about it,
all I could do was heave a sigh of relief.

32:24.692 --> 32:25.735
We're tired.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.863
That's the best thing
that could have happened.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.031
I think it's great.

32:30.114 --> 32:34.994
I hope the whole camp or whatever,
town of Rajneeshpuram is, uh--

32:36.454 --> 32:39.958
Uh, just packs up and leaves
for all I care. I don't like them.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.084
He was scaring a lot of people.

32:41.167 --> 32:45.046
And he was being dishonest
and he finally admitted his dishonesty

32:45.129 --> 32:47.507
and stuck his tail
between his legs and took off.

32:47.590 --> 32:50.802
I think it's time and I think it's
happening at a very appropriate time,

32:50.885 --> 32:52.303
Thanksgiving.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.638
And we are very grateful.

32:53.721 --> 32:57.475
I thoroughly believe that there was
a divine hand behind all this.

32:57.558 --> 33:00.979
I don't think America
has a place for these people.

33:14.033 --> 33:17.370
[male reporter]  They are starting
to leave, a few at a time.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.374
Cars packed with belongings,

33:21.457 --> 33:23.126
destinations uncertain.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.669
[male reporter]
How do you feel about leaving?

33:24.752 --> 33:26.629
-Are you going to miss this place?
-Uh... [chuckles]

33:26.713 --> 33:28.798
I'm missing him already.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.270
It was very abrupt. Quick.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.230
Freaking out.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.065
[male reporter]
So you think people panic at first, huh?

33:46.149 --> 33:50.278
Yeah, I mean,
if your whole roots get cut off...

33:55.867 --> 33:56.868
[male reporter] It's tough.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.037
Good luck to you.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.922
[male reporter]  His followers
were told the ranch will be shut down.

34:10.506 --> 34:13.801
Huh-uh. Forget it.
I'm staying till the end, man.

34:13.885 --> 34:18.389
I'm not going, no fucking way,
until this place is legally sold

34:18.473 --> 34:21.601
and everybody is saying
"Okay, let's go, gang!"

34:21.684 --> 34:24.479
That's it.
Otherwise I'm going nowhere. I'm staying.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.609
I'm staying
until everybody is ready to go.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.825
[male reporter]
On the bus was Spencer Williams,

34:37.909 --> 34:42.789
who left the streets of Washington D.C.
for Rajneeshpuram about a year ago.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.082
Man, I'm gonna miss this place.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.834
I'm gonna miss the people here, too.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.170
Mm, damn. Love it.

34:50.838 --> 34:54.258
[Niren]  I was still the mayor,
and I was basically left in charge

34:54.342 --> 34:57.386
to unwind the legal as best that I could.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.639
We sort of reached a critical mass.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.100
There was so much stress

35:02.183 --> 35:04.477
because I was trying to fight
all of these battles

35:04.560 --> 35:07.396
without the resources we had had.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.733
Simply that it's over here...

35:11.192 --> 35:13.194
that Bhagwan's leaving.

35:13.277 --> 35:19.200
Um... The impact
of the legal attacks on this community

35:19.283 --> 35:21.119
by the state and federal government

35:21.202 --> 35:25.665
have produced a situation
where it is no longer viable

35:25.748 --> 35:30.503
economically or emotionally
or spiritually or sensible to continue.

35:30.586 --> 35:35.258
And Isabel and I went up
to a cabin in the mountains.

35:37.885 --> 35:41.180
Isabel told me that she needed to go.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.182
I, myself, since Bhagwan left,

35:43.266 --> 35:46.561
I didn't think that we were going
to continue this place, you know?

35:46.644 --> 35:48.646
People, we're not fighters.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.441
We're staying in a piece of land
where we're unwelcome.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.570
So I said, "Okay! I'll go with you."

35:55.653 --> 35:57.947
And we left. And that's how it went.

36:02.535 --> 36:08.958
At the ranch, I had an experience
of being loved and accepted totally.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.210
Totally.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.421
[voice breaking]
For the first time in my life.

36:15.047 --> 36:18.593
I'll tell you... that's worth having.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.889
[Sunshine]
I had deep grief.

36:24.056 --> 36:27.435
I felt misunderstood.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.519
I felt...

36:30.813 --> 36:32.732
I felt like, "What just happened?"

36:32.815 --> 36:35.109
You know, I mean, we were
so busy fighting it

36:35.193 --> 36:39.238
that, you know, it was only then
that I actually had a moment to reflect.

36:43.034 --> 36:48.414
And because we were so raw, you know,
it was just like such an explosion.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.293
You know, to walk away from the garden...

36:54.837 --> 36:56.047
and the houses...

36:57.423 --> 36:59.884
and to walk away
from the lakes that we built...

37:04.388 --> 37:05.723
I remember...

37:08.809 --> 37:11.270
everyone was in a good mood always...

37:13.940 --> 37:15.441
and a lot of laughing.

37:18.444 --> 37:23.866
And to recognize what an incredible gift
it was to be alive on this earth...

37:24.951 --> 37:25.952
You know, it was a town.

37:26.035 --> 37:31.624
We actually did, in the end, build this
incredible city that was truly joyous.

37:32.291 --> 37:36.003
It was real people living real lives.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.259
And literally,
in the middle of the winter,

37:41.342 --> 37:46.764
to drive away and know that this, too,
was going to become a ghost town...

37:56.399 --> 38:00.152
It was just an amazingly surreal moment...

38:01.404 --> 38:05.741
with profound implications
for really the whole course of my life.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.201
[man]  Come on.
Everybody, look at the camera.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.663
[overlapping chatter]

38:10.746 --> 38:12.164
-Yeah.
-[laughing]

38:12.248 --> 38:14.166
All right.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.210
[female reporter]
Meanwhile, in the small town of Antelope,

38:16.294 --> 38:18.254
old-time residents are watching
their departures

38:18.337 --> 38:20.256
with a mixture of relief and elation.

38:22.341 --> 38:25.678
For the past few years,
Antelope has been the city of Rajneesh.

38:25.761 --> 38:28.556
And now many of the Rajneesh
welcoming signs are painted over.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.308
The town is Antelope again.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.686
[man] Probably 'cause they just figured
people would rip them off.

38:38.232 --> 38:41.444
[male reporter]  In Antelope,
this was a day of tearing down

38:41.527 --> 38:42.528
and a day of building up.

38:45.656 --> 38:50.286
Well, I think everybody was pretty elated,
you know, when it all fell apart.

38:50.369 --> 38:53.497
People felt like they'd finally gotten
their town back...

38:55.624 --> 38:56.876
which they did.

38:56.959 --> 38:59.420
-[laughing] Son of a gun.
-[man] Okay, you're live in two.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.380
-Phil, get over here.
-[woman] Come on, Phil.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.507
[woman]
Get in here.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.595
-[chuckles]
-We were all ready to celebrate.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.139
-My gosh, you know, he was...
-Yeah.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.016
-Get rid of him.
-We were gonna have a big party.

39:23.986 --> 39:28.282
It's even hard when you live here
to realize it is really true.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.953
It just is going to take a while for us
to realize how fantastic all this is.

39:34.705 --> 39:37.124
[male reporter]
More than 40 supporters from The Dalles

39:37.208 --> 39:40.252
made the pilgrimage to observe
the new government take office.

39:40.336 --> 39:44.131
[all] And I will support the constitution
of the United States of America.

39:44.215 --> 39:48.177
[man] Several years ago,
we would never have dreamed

39:48.260 --> 39:53.808
that anything could happen
to a little community such as this.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.268
But we can't live in the past.

39:58.020 --> 40:02.483
[Bowerman]  Well, this whole thing
that we endured with the Rajneeshees,

40:02.566 --> 40:06.445
it's-- It's similar
to a football or basketball game.

40:10.324 --> 40:12.743
Somebody's going to lose,
somebody is going to win.

40:13.702 --> 40:17.581
When it's all over and done with,
uh, the season's over...

40:17.665 --> 40:18.582
[clears throat]

40:18.666 --> 40:20.126
the champion is crowned.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.879
Of course we won.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.966
Just outside the post office

40:27.049 --> 40:32.263
is a flag pole
and a little statue of an antelope.

40:32.346 --> 40:34.723
It was donated to the community

40:34.807 --> 40:39.019
for standing up
under this pressure that we endured.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.067
[male reporter]
The quotation from Edmund Burke,

40:45.151 --> 40:50.364
"The only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is for good men to do nothing."

40:50.448 --> 40:52.867
[Kelly]
It will serve as a constant reminder

40:52.950 --> 40:57.288
that now that we have Antelope back,
we should remember that we almost lost it.

40:58.956 --> 41:03.461
And I look forward to the day
that I don't remember the Rajneesh at all

41:03.544 --> 41:05.087
until I come in and see that flagpole.

41:06.088 --> 41:10.342
[Bowerman]  For me,
you miss some of the excitement.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.054
For some reason, I don't know why,

41:14.138 --> 41:18.184
but I sure love the fight! [chuckles]

41:19.602 --> 41:22.313
[Silvertooth]
Antelope, it was never the same.

41:23.355 --> 41:26.275
Well, you know so many people had left

41:26.358 --> 41:29.778
that you weren't going back
to what you were before.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.989
It's just not together anymore.

41:32.072 --> 41:35.367
Not a little community like it was.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.204
[Silvertooth]
Cafe and the store are closed.

41:39.788 --> 41:43.292
You know, there was a school here
until all that brouhaha.

41:44.084 --> 41:46.879
You know, time marches on.

41:47.755 --> 41:52.218
It was an extremely unpleasant
part of my life.

41:52.301 --> 41:57.515
And I just would like it to be over with
and not to have to talk about it anymore.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.683
And I don't want for people to meet me

41:59.767 --> 42:03.729
and say, "Oh, yes, I remember your name,"
or "Oh, were you involved with them?"

42:03.812 --> 42:07.399
I don't think
that they're worth that, either.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.403
No.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.284
[male reporter]
This is your first interview.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.996
Your chance
to say something to Oregonians.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.540
Now are you daring me?

42:22.623 --> 42:24.250
[male reporter]
I'm daring you to look at the camera--

42:24.333 --> 42:26.252
Are you daring me to do this?

42:26.335 --> 42:28.295
I'm just asking, you know,
after a year down here,

42:28.379 --> 42:31.298
looking back on all of what happened,
looking back on all of that.

42:32.007 --> 42:36.512
-Today, looking back on that experience.
-Okay. I say to all Oregonians...

42:37.638 --> 42:40.015
that you did not understand Bhagwan,

42:40.099 --> 42:43.561
nor did you understand his teaching,
nor did you understand Sheela.

42:43.644 --> 42:48.983
You have missed out on Rajneeshee,
their business, their intelligence...

42:49.066 --> 42:55.781
and their very special ability
of celebration and laughter.

42:56.865 --> 43:01.453
I laugh more at you

43:01.537 --> 43:06.750
than Oregonians who say that we are happy
that Sheela is in prison.

43:06.834 --> 43:07.835
No.

43:10.212 --> 43:12.923
Are you sorry about anything
that happened in Oregon,

43:13.007 --> 43:14.300
the people that did get sick,

43:14.383 --> 43:17.177
the people that did get hurt
by all of this? Do you have any remorse?

43:17.261 --> 43:20.431
People get sick
all over the world on daily basis.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.057
Why should I feel remorse?

43:22.891 --> 43:27.187
I feel bad that Oregonian
made the same mistake.

43:27.271 --> 43:33.694
They made it in treating blacks,
American Indians, Mormons, Catholics

43:33.777 --> 43:36.864
and any other minorities
they have treated up till now.

43:36.947 --> 43:38.490
That I felt bad for.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.869
But, hey,
I never claimed to change humanity.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.203
I still don't.

43:45.414 --> 43:48.876
[Sheela]  I don't have
much to say about my time in prison.

43:52.296 --> 43:56.216
Bear in mind, I have paid full penalty...

43:57.676 --> 44:03.140
what was charged
to me under American legal system.

44:05.976 --> 44:10.689
In Switzerland, in Europe,
people are not considered criminal

44:10.773 --> 44:15.861
once they have paid
their dues and are crime-free.

44:18.155 --> 44:19.615
[chanting]

44:22.993 --> 44:26.163
[female reporter]  Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh
announced he planned to live in India.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.540
[male reporter]  Reception yesterday
at the New Delhi airport

44:28.624 --> 44:30.918
indicates Bhagwan
still has followers in India.

44:31.001 --> 44:34.713
Bhagwan told his followers, "If they
can harass me, they can harass you."

44:34.797 --> 44:39.093
Bhagwan called Rajneeshpuram
a beautiful experiment that failed.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.471
He ended up back in India.

45:04.868 --> 45:09.540
And after he got back to Poona, then
people started going back to India again.

45:12.501 --> 45:16.130
So I went to India
because I still wanted to be around him

45:16.213 --> 45:18.632
and it was still a great place to be.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.639
At some point he said, "I'm not him.

45:26.515 --> 45:29.601
I'm not this Bhagwan person.
I'm not anybody."

45:30.644 --> 45:34.481
And then people wrote to him and said,
"We got to call you something!"

45:34.565 --> 45:36.108
[chuckles]
You know, "Prince?"

45:39.528 --> 45:42.531
And one of the suggestions
was the name "Osho."

45:43.574 --> 45:45.576
Osho is from the Japanese.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.035
It's an honorarium.

45:48.203 --> 45:52.833
You would speak to your teacher,
your master as Osho.

45:58.505 --> 46:01.758
He'd always been frail,

46:01.842 --> 46:06.305
but he was like almost transparent,
his skin, you know?

46:07.556 --> 46:09.224
Almost like he wasn't there.

46:13.103 --> 46:14.771
He stopped speaking again.

46:15.147 --> 46:16.982
So he was no longer giving discourses.

46:17.065 --> 46:18.525
He would come out...

46:20.277 --> 46:21.361
greet people...

46:26.658 --> 46:28.285
and he would move across the podium

46:28.368 --> 46:33.165
while staying facing forward
to the people there, blessing them.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.556
And that time
I was sitting about three rows back

46:49.640 --> 46:52.809
and he was wavering a little bit.

46:54.269 --> 47:00.484
And at one time I could actually see
his toe was over the edge of the podium.

47:02.486 --> 47:06.990
And I was just willing him to stay alive,

47:07.074 --> 47:13.413
trying to give my life energy to him.

47:16.708 --> 47:19.211
[crowd shouts]
Osho!

47:19.294 --> 47:21.296
And the next day...

47:22.047 --> 47:26.468
everybody was called together
into the Buddha Hall.

47:34.851 --> 47:38.855
[Deva Raj] Yesterday morning, I noticed
that Osho was obviously leaving his body.

47:39.523 --> 47:43.277
We sat on the bed
and he gave us his final words.

47:46.446 --> 47:49.616
He said, "I leave you my dream."

47:54.204 --> 47:59.459
He then lay back quietly and we sat
with him while I held his pulse.

48:04.423 --> 48:05.924
Slowly it faded.

48:09.761 --> 48:13.599
When I could hardly feel it,
I said to him, "Osho, I think this is it."

48:14.641 --> 48:18.145
He just nodded gently
and closed his eyes for the last time.

48:45.714 --> 48:50.886
His body was brought
into the... Buddha Hall...

49:00.646 --> 49:02.731
and placed up on the podium.

49:08.737 --> 49:11.990
[all shout]
Osho!

49:22.542 --> 49:25.629
There are many other things
that he said that we'll let you know,

49:25.712 --> 49:27.589
but for now let me just say to you

49:27.673 --> 49:31.385
that, in death, he was just as you
would have expected, incredible.

49:32.177 --> 49:34.930
[cheering and applause]

49:49.778 --> 49:55.242
And then it was taken from there
to the burning ghats.

49:55.325 --> 50:00.956
Huge procession
with people carrying his body.

50:19.391 --> 50:22.227
[rhythmic clapping and chanting]

50:23.520 --> 50:28.942
And I was standing there,
uh... watching his body burn.

50:41.413 --> 50:45.250
Such a gift... [voice breaks] he was.

50:48.503 --> 50:49.838
Such a gift.

50:55.135 --> 50:56.803
[cheering]

51:05.187 --> 51:07.481
[chanting]

51:22.037 --> 51:26.082
[Jane]  When I heard that Bhagwan,
now known as Osho, had died...

51:28.668 --> 51:30.754
I was strangely indifferent.

51:31.713 --> 51:34.925
That was something behind me.

51:37.469 --> 51:41.056
I'd been in prison
and now I was coming home.

51:42.057 --> 51:45.769
I was 43 years old, but I was a child.

51:47.229 --> 51:49.940
My parents opened their arms to me...

51:51.525 --> 51:53.318
just held me...

51:54.319 --> 51:55.695
and took me home with them.

51:56.905 --> 51:58.615
Not very long after,

51:58.698 --> 52:03.411
I started running a juice bar
in Germany called the Saftladen.

52:04.704 --> 52:07.332
I met my husband George in this juice bar.

52:09.584 --> 52:13.755
And slowly, slowly I began
to get back to planet Earth.

52:20.679 --> 52:24.057
At the same time, outside Germany,

52:24.140 --> 52:28.895
there was still an international
arrest warrant hanging over my head.

52:28.979 --> 52:34.568
The case to murder
Mr. Turner remained open.

52:36.069 --> 52:37.863
[female reporter]
The prosecution alleged that the women

52:37.946 --> 52:41.116
plotted to kill Oregon's
former U.S. Attorney, Charles Turner.

52:42.117 --> 52:46.454
If found guilty, the women could be given
a life sentence in a U.S. jail.

52:47.497 --> 52:50.000
[Jane]
But also at that time,

52:50.083 --> 52:53.295
I had a stability I had never had before.

52:53.378 --> 52:59.551
I was free from prosecution in America
as long as I could stay in Germany.

53:01.261 --> 53:02.262
And one day...

53:03.847 --> 53:06.850
in the middle of the night,
the phone rang.

53:07.559 --> 53:09.477
It was my daughter-in-law.

53:09.561 --> 53:13.106
"Jane," she said. "Peter is in hospital."

53:15.942 --> 53:19.362
I was hearing for the first time
that my son had a brain tumor...

53:20.113 --> 53:21.907
and that he might die.

53:22.407 --> 53:24.492
I was in absolute shock.

53:25.660 --> 53:32.500
But the arrest warrant meant I could not
travel to Australia to go to my dying son.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.503
I had to travel to America.

53:35.587 --> 53:38.089
I had to throw myself
at the mercy of the court

53:38.173 --> 53:41.426
without any guarantees whatsoever.

53:41.509 --> 53:46.640
I wanted to be free to be able to go
to my children at a time like this.

53:48.475 --> 53:50.769
George and I went
to the airport in Frankfurt

53:50.852 --> 53:52.938
and boarded a plane for Portland.

53:55.148 --> 53:58.151
We walked together
to the federal courthouse.

53:58.234 --> 53:59.861
It was raining that morning.

54:00.779 --> 54:03.281
I was very, very focused.

54:04.157 --> 54:09.579
The court had the discretion
of sentencing me to life imprisonment,

54:09.663 --> 54:15.210
but I knew that this was
what had to be done.

54:16.544 --> 54:18.546
As proceedings began,

54:18.630 --> 54:20.507
first the prosecutor spoke

54:20.590 --> 54:25.220
and asked that the judge
sentence me appropriately.

54:25.303 --> 54:27.055
Then it was my turn to speak.

54:27.722 --> 54:31.601
I felt compelled to stand
to what I had done.

54:33.103 --> 54:34.646
I read my statement.

54:36.064 --> 54:40.610
And then the moment
had come for sentencing.

54:43.363 --> 54:49.327
Judge Marsh said that sometimes justice
is stronger than mercy

54:49.411 --> 54:50.870
and that's okay.

54:51.955 --> 54:57.502
But sometimes mercy overrules justice.

54:59.087 --> 55:01.798
And we have such a case before us today.

55:03.591 --> 55:08.596
And therefore,
he was sentencing me to time served.

55:13.226 --> 55:14.227
I was free.

55:15.937 --> 55:17.856
I was free.

55:19.274 --> 55:20.233
And through my tears,

55:20.316 --> 55:24.863
I could see that everybody
in the courtroom was happy for me.

55:25.363 --> 55:29.826
FBI agents came up to me, shook my hand,

55:29.909 --> 55:35.248
and said "Congratulations, Mrs. Stork.
You deserve it."

55:35.874 --> 55:38.043
I wasn't a criminal in that moment.

55:39.669 --> 55:45.133
I was a free woman
with a son who was dying...

55:46.051 --> 55:48.887
and that brought everybody together...

55:50.346 --> 55:53.058
in a very human way.

55:55.685 --> 55:57.771
Even today when I think about it...

56:00.440 --> 56:02.525
Yeah, it brings tears to my eyes.

56:03.693 --> 56:07.614
It was the most incredible experience

56:07.697 --> 56:12.327
to become aware that they were
a lot of people around me that day

56:12.410 --> 56:18.208
who were glad that I could go to my son
and be with him when he died.

56:30.178 --> 56:34.224
[Sheela]  After prison,
I had to get back on my feet.

56:37.352 --> 56:40.814
I had to find way to survive.

56:43.733 --> 56:49.114
When I left Bhagwan,
I left the Sannyasin community also.

56:51.449 --> 56:53.243
I left hypocrisy.

56:55.703 --> 57:02.502
It is time that Bhagwan's Sannyasins
open their eyes...

57:03.586 --> 57:09.175
and look at the reality
of what had happened to Bhagwan.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.719
Bhagwan didn't have a natural death.

57:13.972 --> 57:17.308
This doctor,
who had written death certificate...

57:19.185 --> 57:22.147
felt it was with overdose.

57:27.235 --> 57:31.698
[Deva Raj]  About nine months ago,
Osho formed the inner circle...

57:32.240 --> 57:34.742
a group of Sannyasins
now numbering 20.

57:34.826 --> 57:37.203
The inner circle would be his successor.

57:39.038 --> 57:42.041
[Sheela]  These are the same people
who were drugging him...

57:43.835 --> 57:49.090
and the same people
who are looting him for his riches.

57:52.343 --> 57:56.431
It was your responsibility
to take care of Bhagwan.

57:56.514 --> 58:01.060
At least in my time, he was safe.

58:03.229 --> 58:08.860
But Sannyasin community is my past.

58:10.695 --> 58:17.368
In spite of what world thinks,
I have come out with upper hand.

58:24.125 --> 58:28.588
I work with schizophrenia to dements,

58:28.671 --> 58:31.216
from Parkinson's to Alzheimer,

58:31.299 --> 58:34.427
and young and old dements.

58:35.970 --> 58:38.932
I didn't want old people rejected.

58:41.809 --> 58:44.312
What have I learned from Bhagwan?

58:47.106 --> 58:52.403
How can I implement
his teachings in my daily life?

58:55.073 --> 58:56.866
This commune...

58:56.950 --> 59:00.370
This is what I have learned from Bhagwan.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.040
We eat together.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.211
We sing, dance...

59:10.838 --> 59:14.092
sleep in this house in comfort together.

59:14.884 --> 59:20.640
They can become old in my house
and remain till the last moment.

59:27.188 --> 59:29.857
It is a wonderful way...

59:30.900 --> 59:34.737
of saying thank you to existence.

59:37.073 --> 59:39.409
[Jayananda]
We, as Sannyasins,

59:39.492 --> 59:43.705
should light the consciousness
of people around the world.

59:44.998 --> 59:50.295
You could see
Osho's vision come to fruition.

59:52.297 --> 59:53.131
[screams]

59:56.426 --> 1:00:00.263
There are still communities
devoted to him and his teachings.

1:00:01.514 --> 1:00:02.890
South America...

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:05.143
Europe...

1:00:05.685 --> 1:00:06.894
and Asia.

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:12.859
His publishing
is growing dramatically now.

1:00:12.942 --> 1:00:15.445
It's published in like 50 languages.

1:00:16.487 --> 1:00:19.824
Like 1,000 new book contracts
in the last year.

1:00:21.743 --> 1:00:25.413
[Sunshine]  There are young people
flocking to Poona today...

1:00:26.164 --> 1:00:28.916
to go and learn about his meditations...

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:31.461
and dance in Buddha Hall.

1:00:33.921 --> 1:00:38.009
[woman]  There is a full day program
of meditations available here,

1:00:38.092 --> 1:00:41.929
all day, every day,
from morning till night.

1:00:43.306 --> 1:00:49.395
So, his work, his teachings will live on.

1:00:52.607 --> 1:00:55.443
[Silvertooth]
It all smells like a gimmick to me.

1:00:56.903 --> 1:01:00.031
You know, I just think
it's a fleece from day one.

1:01:01.866 --> 1:01:03.660
I thought he was an old con man.

1:01:05.078 --> 1:01:06.829
They were sitting there in India

1:01:06.913 --> 1:01:10.041
and they saw
all these rich young Europeans

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:13.378
tripping around, looking for God.

1:01:15.129 --> 1:01:18.716
And they figured out these people
have got a lot of money,

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:22.804
so they set up shop and created Bhagwan...

1:01:23.846 --> 1:01:27.642
and found out
that it was pretty easy to fleece them.

1:01:27.725 --> 1:01:29.727
People want to believe.
They want to belong.

1:01:29.811 --> 1:01:31.354
They want to think, you know,

1:01:31.437 --> 1:01:35.358
me having sex all day long is going
to really send me to heaven.

1:01:38.027 --> 1:01:40.029
[laughs]

1:01:41.030 --> 1:01:42.615
Anyway, that's my opinion.

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:46.744
After the Rajneeshees left,
this guy Dennis Washington--

1:01:46.828 --> 1:01:50.790
He's a billionaire developer from Montana.

1:01:51.332 --> 1:01:55.753
He bought the ranch and he ended up
gifting the thing to Young Life.

1:01:56.838 --> 1:01:59.298
It's a Christian youth organization.

1:01:59.382 --> 1:02:02.260
They call them camps.
It's more like a resort to me.

1:02:18.818 --> 1:02:23.740
We went from free sex, the Rajneeshees,
to no sex, Young Life.

1:02:23.823 --> 1:02:28.453
They're very much abstinence-oriented
for their young people.

1:02:28.536 --> 1:02:30.371
It's kind of like a cult too.

1:02:30.455 --> 1:02:32.290
They're not perfect.

1:02:32.373 --> 1:02:34.917
But they're much better neighbors
than the Rajneeshees.

1:02:35.001 --> 1:02:36.461
[laughs]

1:02:36.544 --> 1:02:38.713
They're not waving AK-47's in your face.

1:02:42.258 --> 1:02:43.968
[Niren]
They trade on people's fear.

1:02:44.844 --> 1:02:50.349
And they do that by defining a group
that they can fear and hate.

1:02:51.642 --> 1:02:56.105
And then they totally misrepresent
who you are.

1:02:57.857 --> 1:02:59.901
I think the United States has failed.

1:03:00.985 --> 1:03:04.989
The United States has failed to recognize
the most beautiful man I've ever seen.

1:03:06.199 --> 1:03:09.994
I think the United States has failed
to recognize the contribution

1:03:10.077 --> 1:03:12.997
that he had to offer
to this country and to the world.

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:14.665
I think it's a tragedy.

1:03:17.043 --> 1:03:19.337
[Niren]
From the legal political side of it,

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:24.926
I am the only one who really knows it in
the depth that it can be shared, you know?

1:03:29.388 --> 1:03:32.266
It is somewhat difficult and painful

1:03:32.350 --> 1:03:36.813
to talk about what happened to Osho
in the United States.

1:03:38.064 --> 1:03:41.025
Obviously I loved him very much

1:03:41.108 --> 1:03:43.402
and I was committed to the community.

1:03:46.239 --> 1:03:50.493
And we were committed
to working really hard

1:03:50.576 --> 1:03:57.250
to manifest his vision
of the transformation of the planet.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.129
Before he died...

1:04:03.631 --> 1:04:05.466
I was told,
"Osho wants to talk to you."

1:04:06.634 --> 1:04:08.052
So I went in...

1:04:09.136 --> 1:04:14.892
and he said, "Clear my name
in America by writing a book

1:04:14.976 --> 1:04:17.228
and telling the truth
about what happened."

1:04:19.272 --> 1:04:20.314
And...

1:04:24.318 --> 1:04:27.822
it's taken a long time
and it's had some twists and turns,

1:04:27.905 --> 1:04:32.368
but that's what I'm doing,
is finishing that book now.

Bhagwan used to tell
stories of the Zen master

1:05:23.336 --> 1:05:30.051
who, seeing that his disciple
was ready for enlightenment,

1:05:31.177 --> 1:05:33.804
struck him with a stick and killed him.

1:05:34.472 --> 1:05:39.143
But in the moment before his death,
he became enlightened.

1:05:40.394 --> 1:05:43.731

1:05:44.857 --> 1:05:47.068
"Did I miss the blow from the master?

1:05:47.151 --> 1:05:48.402

the picture of a grub in a cocoon.

If you've ever watched
a butterfly come out of its cocoon,

1:06:15.429 --> 1:06:17.390
it's a long difficult process,

1:06:18.265 --> 1:06:19.892
squeezing and moving

1:06:19.976 --> 1:06:26.899
and the cocoon
is clinging to the moth's body

1:06:26.983 --> 1:06:32.321
until it manages that last... wriggle,

1:06:32.405 --> 1:06:34.198

you are negating
the whole experiment of Oregon

1:08:25.810 --> 1:08:30.523
by cutting it out
from Bhagwan's biography.
