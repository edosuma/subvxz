WEBVTT

00:56.181 --> 00:57.432
Sorry.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.518
Steady.

01:00.602 --> 01:04.189
Arms level... and keep your eye
on the target.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.191
You can do it, kid!

01:06.274 --> 01:08.943
Not a chance. Miss! Come on! Miss!

01:10.445 --> 01:12.238
Ah! Got it.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.532
Bull's-eye! Pay up.
-

01:14.616 --> 01:16.242
Good. Again.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.079
But I've already hit the target
three times.

01:19.162 --> 01:23.583
Out of 12. That's luck, Omega, not skill.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.794
Soldiers need to be consistent.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.297
Okay, double or nothing she chokes.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.220
-

01:35.303 --> 01:37.931
I was doing better
until those two showed up.

01:38.682 --> 01:43.645
You have to learn to tune out
distractions, which comes with practice.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.355
Again.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.489
Not exactly a natural, is she?

01:55.490 --> 01:58.868
-Hey!
-Okay, playtime's over. We need to talk.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.745
You two, scram.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.539
-Hey! Okay, we're going.
-We're going!

02:04.541 --> 02:08.336
I assume you boys know
what a tactical droid is?

02:08.962 --> 02:09.963
They were the opera--

02:10.046 --> 02:12.340
The operational brains
of the Separatist military--

02:12.424 --> 02:14.634
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
This is my briefing, Goggles.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.719
Hey!

02:15.802 --> 02:18.805
Tactical droid intel has tremendous value,

02:18.888 --> 02:23.810
which is why you're gonna break into
this decommissioning facility on Corellia

02:23.893 --> 02:26.896
and retrieve one
before they're all destroyed.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.067
We haven't decided
if we're gonna work for you or not.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.738
Allow me to decide for you. You're in!

02:36.364 --> 02:40.035
I'm talking
a mutually beneficial arrangement.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.955
You make money, I make money,
and I watch your back.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.625
With the heat on you,
it's the best option you've got.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.796
I guess we're in.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.550
I know you're in.
I just told you you're in.

02:55.633 --> 03:00.513
And you, you're releasing too soon
because of those weak noodle arms.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.223
Build up your strength.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.227
Lesson over.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.535
This old trick?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.455
It gets us past
the planetary sensors every time.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.542
Why is a tactical droid more important
than the other droids?

03:29.626 --> 03:34.381
The more tactical droids fought,
the more they learned... and won.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.508
Yeah!

03:36.591 --> 03:38.843
With clones now serving the Empire,

03:38.927 --> 03:42.097
knowing how to defeat them
just went up in value.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.516
We're approaching
the decommissioning site.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.602
We can land at the industrial dockyard
and go in on foot.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.854
Cid didn't mention
this place was guarded by police droids.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.815
They're operating
on a rotating quadrant scan.

04:34.399 --> 04:38.319
If timed correctly, there's an entry point
in their blind spot.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.404
Follow me.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.119
Uh-oh.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.785
- Nighty night.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.841
Echo, Tech.
We'll locate and retrieve the droid.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.551
Wrecker, cover us up top.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.846
But being the lookout was Crosshair's job.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.556
That wasn't a request.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.392
What about me? What should I do?

05:50.475 --> 05:53.353
Stay here
and keep your eyes peeled for the target.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.437
Let's move.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.393
A tactical droid is listed
in the system, but only one.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.478
The rest have already been destroyed.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.148
We have one shot at this.
Let's get it right.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.066
Where was the droid off-loaded?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.484
North end conveyor.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.487
Found it.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.572
Sort of.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.907
The droid's already in pieces.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.659
Is the head intact?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.119
Affirmative.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.371
Wait! Someone just ran off
with the droid head.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.378
I see 'em.
One of the workers is stealing our target.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.213
I'm on it.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.132
Negative. Stay out of sight.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.383
I don't think so.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.802
Stay back.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.597
Whoa, whoa. Take it easy, kid.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.434
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I can't have you getting in the way.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.478
You're the one in my way.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.898
Rafa, I've got the target. Where are you?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.941
Don't answer that.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.074
Rafa, come in. What's going on?
Where are you? We need to get out of here.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.660
Who are you?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.538
Who am I? Who are you?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.793
Your arms look a little shaky there.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.464
Okay, you win.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.635
Why don't you ease up on that thing
and we can talk about this?

07:59.396 --> 08:00.397
Uh-oh.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.108
We've got blaster fire!

08:04.025 --> 08:05.610
All eyes on the floor!

08:10.365 --> 08:12.659
Security breach! Lock it down!

08:14.703 --> 08:17.247
Danger. Danger.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.252
Great. How do you plan
on getting out of here now?

08:24.421 --> 08:25.714
Nice going, kid.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.341
Me? You're the one who grabbed my bow!

08:32.554 --> 08:35.473
Don't just stand there. Grab a weapon.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.725
I had one.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.898
Get moving!

08:43.982 --> 08:45.316
See ya.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.860
Hey!

08:46.943 --> 08:48.820
We've got police droids closing in.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.071
Focus your fire.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.913
-Omega, report.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.000
There's a second person
after the tactical droid.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.918
Don't worry. I'm in pursuit.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.421
No, stay put.
We already have the droid head.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.922
No, you don't.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.635
Rafa, I have the package.
Meet me at the rendezvous.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.639
I'll get the head.
You get this lockdown lifted.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.358
-Trace, where are you?

09:26.441 --> 09:27.734
Down here!

09:29.027 --> 09:30.403
Catch!

09:31.071 --> 09:32.697
Got it! Come on.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.079
I've got it!

09:45.418 --> 09:47.003
Hope you're not expecting gratitude.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.506
Should I have let the droids shoot you?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.187
-Thanks!
-

10:04.270 --> 10:05.397
I have the droid head!

10:07.899 --> 10:09.734
Nice work. Now hang tight.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.909
You shorted out the entire system.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.661
I had to override the lockdown.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.163
Wrecker, get to the main control panel.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.209
Whoa, whoa! Whoa...

10:27.085 --> 10:28.628
I can't reach the platform.

10:28.712 --> 10:32.257
It's the only way to reboot
the whole facility. Figure it out!

10:32.340 --> 10:34.175
Yeah, that's easy for you to say!

10:41.516 --> 10:43.184
Wrecker, hurry.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.777
Don't look down. Don't look down.
Don't look down.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.701
Wrecker, what are you waiting for?
-

11:06.666 --> 11:07.917
I'll take that.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.302
Wrecker, the system's online.
Now get down here.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.139
...head.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.600
Good soldiers...

11:47.874 --> 11:49.918
Why are you
after that tactical droid?

11:50.001 --> 11:52.045
That's not your business, clone.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.463
It is today.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.096
-Rafa, I've got the target.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.639
Meet me at the north exit.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.557
Little busy right now.

12:24.786 --> 12:28.665
Hunter, I'm stuck on the conveyor.
I need help.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.917
I'm on my way.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.508
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking down the support posts.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.718
Follow me!

12:42.929 --> 12:44.389
Who put you in charge?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.036
Hunter!

13:06.119 --> 13:07.412
Hang on, Omega!

13:08.872 --> 13:12.208
Hey, you maniac, you almost got me killed!

13:27.307 --> 13:30.268
Hey, over here! Hurry!

13:35.440 --> 13:36.524
I can't reach!

13:38.943 --> 13:40.320
Grab something!

13:58.672 --> 14:00.048
We got you, kid.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.051
Are you okay?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.472
Thank you.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.224
You're welcome.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.062
-

14:17.023 --> 14:19.943
Oh, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me or anything.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.531
Well, this has been a real treat,

14:24.614 --> 14:28.159
but as you can see,
the tactical droid is ours.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.411
We can debate this later.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.830
If we wanna get out of here,
we need to work together.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.581
Fine, but I still don't like you.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.749
I'm used to it.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.421
Wrecker, come in. Wrecker?

14:40.714 --> 14:44.718
-No. No. No, no, no.
- Wrecker?

14:44.801 --> 14:46.803
Good soldiers follow orders.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.353
All the exits are blocked.
And it's about to get worse.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.689
A larger wave of police droids
is headed our way.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.113
We need a diversion.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.282
What we need is a diversion.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.701
Is there an echo in here?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.703
Yes.
-What?

15:11.786 --> 15:12.829
I'm Echo.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.913
Really?

15:14.581 --> 15:17.334
Okay, Echo, we need a distraction.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.169
And he can help with that.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.049
What's that thing gonna do?

15:24.132 --> 15:28.011
We need an army to get out of this.
And we happen to have one.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.895
If you activate those clankers,
they'll start shooting at us.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.981
Not if we're controlling the droid
who's controlling them.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.816
Excellent idea.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.194
That should do the trick.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.114
It didn't work.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.325
It will, once we boost the signal.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.203
And this will help me access the program.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.674
-Wrecker, do you copy?

16:08.259 --> 16:10.512
Wrecker, where are you?
We need your help.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.395
On my way.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.691
Brilliant plan, Trace.
Really. One of your best.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.818
We just need a little more time.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.910
Yeah!

16:33.993 --> 16:36.496
I got tired of you guys
having all the fun.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.289
Now, him I like.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.760
Hang on.
The data exchange is nearly complete.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.013
Done!

16:53.096 --> 16:54.556
What is happening?

16:54.639 --> 16:58.643
Activate battle droids.
Command them to attack all police droids.

16:58.727 --> 16:59.978
Affirmative.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.819
Huh? What's happening?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.155
I don't know. Did we win?

17:10.238 --> 17:14.659
New command sequence.
Your target is factory security personnel.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.958
Orders are orders.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.008
Never thought I'd see
battle droids helping us.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.260
That's our cue. Move out!

17:34.054 --> 17:35.305
Mission accomplished.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.473
Nice work.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.391
-R7, we're ready for a pickup.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.564
We're almost there.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.899
Trust me. You'll see us.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.028
No!

17:52.697 --> 17:53.698
Yeah!

17:54.324 --> 17:55.533
Nice shot.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.660
It's all about tuning out distractions.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.538
He's here. Let's go!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.644
All that work for nothing.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.689
Whoever Cid's buyer is
isn't gonna be happy.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.732
Let me get this straight.

18:27.816 --> 18:31.111
You knew how dangerous
the information on the tactical droid is,

18:31.194 --> 18:33.530
but you didn't know who
you were giving it to?

18:34.030 --> 18:37.867
We're being paid to acquire and deliver,
not ask questions.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.496
Our contact needed that information
to fight back against the Empire.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.417
They're trying to help people
and make things better.

18:46.793 --> 18:51.840
Why aren't you fighting for the Empire?
Isn't that what you clones do now?

18:52.590 --> 18:55.760
Not all of us. We're different.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.847
Yeah, I've heard that before.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.981
You should come visit us sometime.

19:08.773 --> 19:12.110
Isn't that part of Ord Mantell
a little... seedy?

19:12.193 --> 19:15.447
Very. It's great!

19:15.530 --> 19:17.574
Keep working on that bow, kid.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.659
I will. Bye!

19:20.577 --> 19:21.661
Bye, Omega.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.498
Here.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.916
What's this?

19:27.000 --> 19:31.087
Tech copied the tactical droid's intel
to this data rod before it got destroyed.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.007
Why are you giving it to us?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.343
You'll use it for the right reasons.

19:36.426 --> 19:39.596
Huh. Maybe you are different.

19:40.472 --> 19:44.851
To be honest, things were clearer
when we were just soldiers.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.436
Take it from me.

19:47.395 --> 19:50.106
In the end, we all choose sides.
