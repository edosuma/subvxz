WEBVTT

01:06.680 --> 01:08.330
Los Phantomas.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.841
Oh!

02:18.440 --> 02:19.771
Juan?

02:21.600 --> 02:22.931
Luis?

02:24.920 --> 02:26.285
Pablo!

02:40.920 --> 02:42.046
Oh...

02:42.200 --> 02:44.487
No, no, no, please!

02:44.680 --> 02:46.250
No, no, no!

02:46.400 --> 02:48.656
Look, there's money. Look at
all the drugs around you, man.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.251
We could do business. We'll get you rich!

02:55.680 --> 02:57.444
What are you doing? No.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.728
Stop doing that. No, what are you...

03:07.240 --> 03:10.130
No, no. Look, you got
all this money around, man.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.248
No, no...

03:14.560 --> 03:15.561
He's my kitten, Iglesias.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.961
Please, please.
No, don't hurt him. Please.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.286
No, no, no.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.807
That's my baby, Iglesias. No, no.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.803
He's a kitten, you know.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.564
Everybody likes baby kittens.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.801
Right?

03:31.960 --> 03:33.962
You know, it's not so bad, yeah.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.816
Please, no. Look, I'll go away.
I'll go away, please!

03:40.840 --> 03:42.683
Please, no!

03:51.200 --> 03:52.201
Freeze! Police!

03:52.360 --> 03:53.486
Drop your weapon now!

03:53.640 --> 03:55.324
Show me your hands now!

03:55.480 --> 03:57.642
On the ground. Get on the ground!

03:57.840 --> 03:58.841
Get on the ground now!

04:48.200 --> 04:50.202
Call Rell.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.328
Calling Rell.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.086
Hey, cuz!

05:04.280 --> 05:06.408
Oh, my gosh. You're alive, man.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.449
How are you? How you doing?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.728
Nothing makes sense anymore.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.891
Are you okay?

05:14.920 --> 05:16.729
Maisie broke up with me.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.402
Yes! Finally.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.364
Oh, buddy, I'm sorry.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.925
What happened? Why?

05:23.080 --> 05:24.650
I don't know.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.808
She said my life wasn't going anywhere.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.605
I mean, what the fuck does that even mean?

05:34.760 --> 05:36.336
Hey, you know what?
I'm gonna swing by right now.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.361
No!

05:37.840 --> 05:39.922
Clarence, I don't want you
to see me like this.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.481
I look like Apollo Creed.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.005
Which Rocky?

05:44.440 --> 05:46.442
The one where he died.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.602
Oh, boy. Okay. All right.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.842
Hang on, I'm gonna be right there, okay?

05:51.440 --> 05:52.851
Okay.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.961
Oh!

06:18.920 --> 06:20.490
Can I help you?

06:26.120 --> 06:27.360
Hey.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.286
Hey.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.325
Here you go.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.403
Go ahead. Drink some.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.365
It's just milk.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.010
I swear, look.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.726
There.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.961
You just drank it 'cause I drank it.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.091
Oh, you're so hungry.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.770
What?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.246
Okay.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.721
No, no, no, you need a bath.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.962
All right, just stay there.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.767
All right, we're gonna have to walk.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.890
Rell, it's gonna be okay.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.407
Now, I know you don't want to
hear this right now,

07:37.600 --> 07:38.896
but everything happens for a reason.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.921
You're right, Clarence.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.287
Everything does happen for a reason.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.527
I want you to meet

07:44.560 --> 07:45.721
Keanu.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.766
What?

07:48.920 --> 07:49.921
No.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.161
No.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.249
Oh, my God!

07:53.400 --> 07:55.687
That's the cutest cat
I've ever seen in my life.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.490
Hello! I'm sorry, Keanu?

07:57.640 --> 07:59.085
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.130
I think it means "cool breeze"
in Hawaiian.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.376
Honey, I'm sorry I can't come
with you guys this weekend.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.576
It's just I've got all that
stuff to do around the house.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.840
I understand, honey. It's fine.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.296
I got the low-flow toilet to put in.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.896
I just want you to do me
a little favor this weekend.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.216
- Yeah.
- I want you to try and relax.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.163
Right. Got it. Absolutely.
What do you mean?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.243
Well, sometimes you can be
a little wound up.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.925
Wound up? How am I wound up?

08:22.080 --> 08:24.845
You're not hearing me.
You're not hearing me.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.241
You spend so much time
trying to be the person

08:27.440 --> 08:29.602
- you think everyone wants you to be.
- Okay.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.081
And I just want you to be Clarence.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.936
Okay, great.
If that's what you want, then...

08:33.960 --> 08:35.216
- But, see, that's what I'm saying.
- No, no, no.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.481
I mean, that's what I want,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.130
Deep breath. Ready?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.486
Just...

08:40.679 --> 08:42.284
Ah!

08:43.120 --> 08:44.610
Loosen up your shoulders.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.171
And what's crack-a-lacking,
beautiful people?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.845
Hey, Spencer.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.809
Hannah. A vision, as always.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.961
Oh, thank you.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.121
- Give me that.
- Okay.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.880
- Clarence. Give me some skin.
- Spencer.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.416
You got it, brother.
That's all the skin you get.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.441
Where's Belle?

08:58.640 --> 09:01.211
Oh, honey, let me get her for you. Belle!

09:02.000 --> 09:03.126
- Them's some pipes.
- Right.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.647
Our daughters just can't get
enough of each other, huh?

09:05.800 --> 09:07.896
I'm tellin' ya. Girls, right?
Raising girls is the best.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.001
- I tell ya, yeah.
- Yeah.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.730
- Hey. Here we go.
- Thanks.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.296
Hey, you know what?
Maybe when you get back,

09:12.320 --> 09:14.200
we can see that new
Shailene Woodley movie, huh?

09:14.240 --> 09:16.208
Clarence, you're embarrassing me.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.329
- My bad.
- She got ya. She got ya.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.160
- There we go. There.
- Let's do it, kids.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.163
Get your seatbelt on, young ladies.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.685
Okay. We got this.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.966
Oh, honey.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.051
Really got to go, guys.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.201
All right, sweetheart.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.203
All right. Okay.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.244
Uh, where's Micah?

09:35.400 --> 09:38.483
Oh, well, unfortunately,
my beautiful bride sends her apologies.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.920
She can't make it this weekend.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.530
She's got food poisoning.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.006
- Oh, no.
- Oh!

09:43.160 --> 09:46.607
Yeah, poor thing. She was up all night
just projectile vomiting.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.000
- Oh!
- And more.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.856
You know.
I'll spare you the gritty details.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.405
- Thanks.
- Oh! Oh, yeah.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.164
And diarrhea is what I'm talking about.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.361
- Right.
- Oh.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.249
Great. So, no Micah, then?

09:56.680 --> 09:59.047
No. No Micah this weekend.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.685
That's okay. That's okay.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.842
That's too bad. It's too bad. But, uh...

10:03.000 --> 10:04.411
- It's fine.
- Okay. Well, yeah.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.360
Take care.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.648
- And have a good time.
- We will.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.285
Oh, yep.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.889
- Bye, honey.
- Drive safe. Bye, Belle.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.361
Take care, guys! Have a great time!

10:19.280 --> 10:20.361
Ah!

10:20.800 --> 10:22.928
Here's kitty!

10:23.080 --> 10:24.730
No, you don't want to go through there.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.723
Look, you just want to
stay in there, okay?

10:26.880 --> 10:29.400
She's just found your manuscript
and you're ferocious with that.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.016
So, you're gonna stay right there. Yeah.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.201
Rell?

10:32.400 --> 10:33.765
Just find the space. In here!

10:33.920 --> 10:34.921
Hey.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.724
Wow, you're working again.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.041
What is that?

10:39.240 --> 10:41.242
- This is December.
- December?

10:41.400 --> 10:42.731
Yeah, for the calendar.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.882
I didn't tell you about
the calendar. Check it.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.081
The calendar?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.401
Oh!

10:51.120 --> 10:53.361
- Well, this is amazing.
- Thanks.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.324
You could make a bundle on this.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.721
Yeah, I know.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.570
I mean, I'm not gonna sell it.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.087
- Oh!
- It's for personal use only. And family.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.401
Oh, well, thank you.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.841
No, I wouldn't want to exploit
Keanu's cuteness like that.

11:04.920 --> 11:05.921
Okay.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.524
You have been very productive.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.683
- I know, right?
- Um...

11:14.920 --> 11:15.921
Yeah. You know what?

11:16.080 --> 11:17.445
This movie's in about 20 minutes.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.096
- Are you ready to go?
- Uh, yes, okay.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.167
Come here, buddy.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.976
Good job today, man. You did really good.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.560
I'm gonna put Keanu in his little nook.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.601
Oh, he has a nook?

11:24.760 --> 11:26.649
Of course he has a nook.
Everyone has a nook.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.165
Okay. Hey, buddy.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.810
House meeting.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.445
I'm nothing without you.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.320
And at the same time,
I need you to clean up

11:33.440 --> 11:35.283
your little area while I'm gone.
Is that cool?

11:35.440 --> 11:37.442
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay. Good.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.806
Uh, say goodbye.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.007
You're coming with me.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.881
Right, yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.929
Uh, goodbye, Keanu.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.446
Cool.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.200
Now, we'll talk about it later.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.691
Okay. Bye. Hey.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.764
Get that bitch!

11:56.280 --> 11:57.725
Get her! Get her!

11:57.880 --> 11:59.848
Get her! Yeah!

12:00.000 --> 12:01.331
I'm psyched for this movie, man.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.840
Is that a photo of you and Maisie?

12:02.960 --> 12:04.371
Yeah. I mean, it was.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.967
That was amazing! Movie of the year!

12:08.160 --> 12:10.696
That is, like, the best Liam Neesons movie
I've ever seen in my life.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.176
- Best Liam Neesons movie ever.
- Hands down.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.043
I'm, like, jacked up from that movie!

12:14.200 --> 12:17.283
- All right, settle down. Settle down.
- Whoo!

12:17.680 --> 12:20.206
What a way to start a weekend,
you know what I mean?

12:20.360 --> 12:21.771
That's good, because now,

12:21.920 --> 12:24.321
I've got all that "doing me"
stuff out of the way,

12:24.480 --> 12:26.403
and now tomorrow, I can mow the lawn,

12:26.560 --> 12:27.816
- I can get my bills done.
- Hey. Hey.

12:27.840 --> 12:32.164
You don't think that going and seeing
a Liam Neesons movie with me right now

12:32.320 --> 12:34.288
counts towards you doing you.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.656
- What? That is me doing me.
- No.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.216
I wanted to see that movie.
Hannah would never go see that with me.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.241
It's just the beginning.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.656
You have something else planned
for the rest of the weekend?

12:41.680 --> 12:43.200
We're gonna go to my house, right now.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.810
We're gonna smoke some weed.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.962
No, Rell. Hannah would...

12:47.160 --> 12:49.208
Will love it. Hannah will love it.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.725
You don't know my wife very well.

12:50.880 --> 12:55.366
I know her well enough to know that
she's a woman, and women like bad boys.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.727
Who are you to give me this advice?
Are you bad?

12:57.920 --> 13:01.720
I mean, I'm not saying I roll up,
fuckin' with my AK, poppin' fools.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.960
No, you're not rolling up,

13:03.080 --> 13:04.256
because that would require
a driver's license,

13:04.280 --> 13:05.936
- which you, as a grown man, do not have.
- Fair enough.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.216
So, there will be
no rolling up with AK's or anything else.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.840
But I don't have a driver's license
'cause I'm from New York City.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.325
NYC, baby.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.240
Where, yeah, the dudes
that kicked my ass...

13:14.360 --> 13:15.536
- Yes?
- Were bigger than the dudes

13:15.560 --> 13:16.696
that kicked your ass, motherfucker.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.560
I'm from Detroit.
Detroit public school system.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.211
Impossible. Guaranteed
the guys who kicked my ass

13:21.400 --> 13:23.696
were twice as big and scary as
the guys who kicked your ass.

13:23.720 --> 13:30.490
- No way.
- Guaranteed.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.402
- Fine. So...
- Guaranteed.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.721
You have to get the last one.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.565
Do it. I don't care.
I'm not getting into a...

13:39.720 --> 13:40.721
No way.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.082
What makes you think
I can't handle my business?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.322
I've got it all on lock.
I'm good to go, drawg.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.445
I'm good to go, dude.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.410
George Michael is holding it down.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.487
- See, you just grooved on it.
- I'm not saying...

14:00.640 --> 14:01.641
You just went...

14:01.840 --> 14:03.365
I'm not saying it's not a good song.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.522
I'm saying we should be listening to this.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.125
What are you doing? You all right?

14:12.280 --> 14:13.406
What is that?

14:35.960 --> 14:38.201
Yeah. Roll on, po-po.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.486
I'm sorry, no.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.416
You don't get to say,
"Roll on, po-po" like that

14:41.440 --> 14:44.523
after you just smiled
and waved to the police.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.687
He ain't want none, did he?

14:49.480 --> 14:50.845
Rell, what does that mean?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.207
Oh, snap. Is it raining?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.045
Well, it's LA. It'll stop in a minute.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.525
So, what? You're so hardcore,

15:00.680 --> 15:02.523
you're just, like,
afraid of a little rain?

15:02.680 --> 15:04.444
Why is your door open?

15:06.040 --> 15:07.166
Keanu.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.091
Keanu!

15:11.840 --> 15:12.966
Keanu!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.570
Keanu!

15:18.240 --> 15:19.890
Keanu!

15:20.840 --> 15:21.841
Keanu!

15:22.600 --> 15:23.681
Rell.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.561
Rell!

15:28.640 --> 15:29.721
I'm sorry.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.047
No.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.966
No!

15:41.120 --> 15:43.600
I am so sorry, buddy.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.441
No!

15:50.120 --> 15:51.320
Listen, the cops are here now.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.856
And they're gonna take care of it. Right.

15:52.880 --> 15:53.881
They're professional.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.122
They take this kind of stuff seriously.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.886
Crimson Tide. Good one.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.246
These are good. You take these?

16:02.680 --> 16:04.728
They're just pictures. Keep them.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.611
Do you think there's any chance
you might find the guys who did this?

16:07.920 --> 16:08.921
Hell no.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.003
In most burglaries,
the guys are never caught.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.401
Oh, um...

16:14.960 --> 16:16.769
You know, there might be a chance.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.131
I wish that I could be more help.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.681
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to take that blanket back.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.761
Oh.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.045
This sucks.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.850
Are you sure he was stolen?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.923
These guys don't usually take pets.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.243
Usually they're after drugs
or something they can sell for drugs.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.481
We'll keep an eye out for the cat.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.920
Thank you very much.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.605
Take care of each other.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.886
See, now that's promising.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.168
Maybe Keanu will come back,
or maybe he'll...

16:47.320 --> 16:48.446
Rell?

16:48.720 --> 16:49.846
Where are you going?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.001
Hulka's house.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.525
Who is Hulka?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.684
My weed dealer.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.251
What?

16:56.400 --> 16:58.971
You live across the way
from your weed dealer?

17:00.160 --> 17:01.446
Oh, sup, sup, bro?

17:02.200 --> 17:04.281
Hey, Hulka. This is my cousin, Clarence.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.329
- Hello.
- Sup?

17:08.200 --> 17:09.440
All right, in or out.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.046
Can't leave the door open,
you know what I'm sayin'?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.480
And don't fuck up all this shit.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.010
I'm building a motorcycle.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.483
So, the reason I'm here...

17:17.680 --> 17:19.364
- Okay, look...
- No.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.965
This is the perfect
sativa-dominant hybrid strain.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.645
It's called Spoonie Gee.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.883
Great. This is all great.
I'm not here for any of that.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.720
I'm here because my place got broken into.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.805
Oh, shit, you serious?

17:30.960 --> 17:32.883
Oh, man, that suck a thick donkey ball.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.804
What'd they get?

17:34.960 --> 17:36.450
They got Keanu.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.170
- Oh, shit. The little guy?
- Yeah.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.049
Oh, fuck, man. I'm sorry, bro.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.287
Okay. So...

17:41.440 --> 17:42.601
Thank you.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.250
I got an anti-sadness strain in here.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.136
- It's called Walking on Sunshine.
- No, no. I don't care.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.969
No, I'm not here for weed, man.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.488
I'm here just to ask you
some questions. Like,

17:51.640 --> 17:55.087
has anyone shady come by here
in the last couple of days?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.923
Well, I mean... Well, um...

17:58.680 --> 18:01.843
You know, I run
a professional business here.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.844
I never had a dissatisfied customer.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.249
I don't know,
it's a real fucking quandary.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.324
Maybe it's someone that
you're selling all of this marijuana to.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.605
Yeah. Or maybe it was somebody who thought
they were breaking into your house?

18:15.120 --> 18:16.360
Oh, yeah. Look, bro.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.522
I be real with you, okay?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.968
I'm so fucking high right now.
I'm not even sure you're real.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.491
I'm just like, where am I?

18:23.640 --> 18:25.051
Where did all these eels come from?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.201
Oh, shit!

18:26.360 --> 18:27.361
No, no, no.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.647
No, no, no, no.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.481
Hulka!

18:31.640 --> 18:33.560
Who the fuck would want to
break into your house?

18:35.520 --> 18:36.521
The Blips.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.886
Man, the Blips.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.166
The Blips?

18:39.520 --> 18:42.842
These are the guys that were kicked out
of the Bloods and the Crips.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.286
The Blips.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.885
Blood-Crips, Blips.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.044
I've started getting into
selling some heavier shit,

18:49.200 --> 18:50.850
and when you're selling the heavier shit,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.571
turf becomes a thing. You know?

18:53.720 --> 18:56.644
And so, yeah. I mean,
the 17th Street Blips,

18:56.800 --> 18:58.564
they did tell me, you know,

18:58.720 --> 19:01.007
they gonna break in and "fuck my shit up."

19:01.600 --> 19:03.921
But... I mean, that's not,
like, concrete proof.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.521
The 17th Street Blips.
Okay, where are they?

19:07.720 --> 19:08.721
17th Street.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.245
Be specific!

19:10.400 --> 19:13.404
Dude, look! I get you lost your kitty-cat,

19:13.560 --> 19:17.326
but y'all some dumb fucks if
you think I'm gonna be a rat.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.927
I ain't some punk-ass bitch
who's gonna be intimidated by y'all nerds!

19:21.080 --> 19:22.411
- You...
- Nerds...

19:22.560 --> 19:24.847
Yeah, that's right! You a fuckin' nerd!

19:25.000 --> 19:26.889
- What you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.601
Oh, shit! You fucking crazy?

19:30.760 --> 19:32.205
No, not my De La!

19:32.360 --> 19:33.850
Yeah, I got your De La now, bitch.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.240
Hulka? Is everything okay?

19:35.440 --> 19:36.930
Mom, not now!

19:37.080 --> 19:38.081
Bro, no.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.169
Oh, you fuck!

19:40.360 --> 19:41.361
What's this?

19:41.520 --> 19:43.600
No, no, no! Not Grandmaster.
Not Grandmaster, please!

19:43.680 --> 19:44.761
Tell me!

19:44.920 --> 19:47.924
Okay, okay! Dude's at a strip club
called Hot Party Vixens.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.327
Okay? But this dude, their leader,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.960
his name is Cheddar,
and he is a bad motherfucker.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.442
You don't wanna mess with him.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.968
Dude, you lost your cat.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.803
You lost your cat.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.161
Come on, Rell.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.482
We'll figure something out in the morning.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.170
It's not over.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.649
All right, this is the place.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.609
Hot Party Vixens.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.485
HPV.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.005
That's unfortunate.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.561
Check it. We're going to approach the bar.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.121
Then we are going to
explain the situation.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.481
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.376
See, you're talking about
explaining the situation.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.483
Hulka said this is a crazy
drug dealer named Cheddar.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.641
So?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.484
What's so scary about "Cheddar"?

20:31.640 --> 20:32.971
Cheddar is a psychopath name.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.011
You only name yourself
something adorable if you can back it up.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.936
- I don't think that's a thing.
- That's a thing.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.849
If you meet a guy named
Fluffy Pink Bunny Head,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.161
he will stab you in the eye.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.005
I'm sure that this Cheddar guy
is gonna be reasonable about money.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.686
And, if need be,
we will just buy Keanu back.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.683
No, no. Not like that. Come on, just...

20:48.840 --> 20:49.841
What, this?

20:50.360 --> 20:52.522
- Yeah, pop the collar.
- Uh...

20:54.000 --> 20:55.126
- Okay?
- Yeah.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.845
It's what the kids are doing.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.001
Not really.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.851
But okay.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.725
- Ready?
- Yeah.

21:27.480 --> 21:28.720
Wow!

21:28.880 --> 21:32.043
God gave you one face.
Why would you change it?

21:32.200 --> 21:33.247
Nope, Clarence.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.004
I just don't understand that at all.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.286
- No, no, no.
- No, what?

21:36.480 --> 21:37.481
No, this was a bad idea.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.405
Isn't your cat here?
We need to get the cat.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.369
- Hey, baby.
- Hello, how do you do?

21:42.520 --> 21:44.568
Oh, dear. Okay.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.721
I'm, uh...

21:45.880 --> 21:47.962
I'm flattered. Thank you.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.161
But I am married.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.401
No.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.528
- Thank you.
- Oh...

21:52.720 --> 21:54.051
You just took my wedding ring.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.856
No, no, no. We're here,
we're here, you're good.

21:55.880 --> 21:56.881
One beer, please.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.366
I'll take a white wine...

21:58.520 --> 22:00.056
Sir, that young lady just took
my wedding ring,

22:00.080 --> 22:01.216
- so I'm wondering...
- It's all right.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.084
- No, no. Clarence, Clarence, Clarence!
- Yeah.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.004
You can't talk like that here.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.806
- Okay?
- I can't talk like what?

22:08.960 --> 22:12.282
You sound like Richard Pryor
doing an impression of a white guy.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.927
I do not sound like Richard Pryor
doing an impression of a white guy.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.570
"I do not sound like Richard Pryor

22:18.720 --> 22:20.529
"doing an impression of a white guy."

22:20.680 --> 22:22.762
You sound like John Ritter all the time.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.526
Well, I beg to differ, nigga.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.284
N-word. Went straight to the N-word.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.936
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- It's not authentic.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.416
Because that's how
real people talk, Clarence.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.204
No, it is not in my experience.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.096
- It's not how people talk.
- Please, please, you're wrong.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.056
You understand? People understand
the historical significance of that word,

22:37.080 --> 22:38.280
and that you can't just say it

22:38.360 --> 22:39.936
shiftlessly with no
responsibility whatsoever.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.291
Absolutely wrong. 100% wrong.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.283
Listen, this is life.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.283
You listen to me. You don't shush me.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.885
You niggas in the right place?

22:47.280 --> 22:49.601
Yeah, we in the right place, nigga!

22:49.800 --> 22:52.041
You in the right place, nigga?

22:52.560 --> 22:54.642
Who the fuck are these niggas?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.006
Who the fuck are we?

22:56.160 --> 22:58.401
Who the fuck aren't we?

22:58.720 --> 23:01.166
- Oh!
- Are you trying to die today?

23:02.240 --> 23:03.890
Nah.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.485
We ain't trying to die today.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.768
Let me break it down right quick.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.968
Y'all gonna take us to Cheddar,

23:10.120 --> 23:12.487
and then we can start nailin'
down the hows and whens

23:12.640 --> 23:14.051
and wherefores and...

23:14.240 --> 23:15.241
Whys.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.801
Did I not mention the whys?
The whys, too, motherfucker.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.008
- Well, look here, homeboy.
- Yeah, dude.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.561
You in Bliptown now,

23:22.720 --> 23:24.484
and you don't make the rules.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.244
Cheddar does.

23:26.440 --> 23:29.842
And you don't meet Cheddar
until you meet me.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.520
You feel me?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.810
So who the fuck are you niggas?

23:35.320 --> 23:36.810
Nigga...

23:37.240 --> 23:38.890
Nigga, nigga...

23:39.080 --> 23:41.128
- Psst. Tell her, man.
- Nigga...

23:43.320 --> 23:45.243
I'm Techtonic.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.965
- Nice!
- Thank you.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.921
What about you?

23:50.160 --> 23:52.083
My name is Shark Tank.

23:52.320 --> 23:57.360
Well, look here, Techtonic and Shark Tank.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.569
Cheddar is a businessman.
He don't take drop-bys.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.404
You think we don't mean business?

24:05.160 --> 24:07.401
And swam.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.731
Why don't you search 'em, Bud?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.882
Go on ahead, Bud.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.203
These niggas not strapped.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.806
- Come on.
- Yeah, let's come on, then.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.246
What's up, motherfucker?

24:53.400 --> 24:54.765
What?

25:02.360 --> 25:04.089
Chill. Hey, yo, Cheddar.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.169
You'll get it next time, boss.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.161
Hi-C.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.130
The fuck is this?

25:33.280 --> 25:34.327
I'm Techtonic.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.881
Sup, Cheddar? Finally.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.122
- He's Shark...
- The king pimp himself.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.281
Shark Tank.

25:40.440 --> 25:44.081
Yeah, I mean, we've been looking
forward to this, dawg. Ha-ha!

25:44.240 --> 25:46.971
Talkin' about the H-N-I-C.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.281
My man.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.606
All right.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.841
Yeah.

25:54.680 --> 25:55.960
You know, I got a lot of enemies

25:56.080 --> 25:59.562
that would love to walk in this room
and put a bullet hole in old Cheddar.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.606
Hey!

26:02.880 --> 26:04.803
We ain't got no beef with you, Cheddar.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.571
No? How about now, nigga?

26:10.440 --> 26:12.442
That's a nice piece.

26:13.080 --> 26:16.607
You should keep the safety on.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.689
You know what? I get it.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.205
Hi-C, what the fuck is this, huh?

26:20.360 --> 26:23.011
You bring me a couple of bitch-ass niggas
as a joke, right?

26:24.360 --> 26:26.249
- What?
- Us? Uh, no.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.010
I'm sorry, bitch-ass niggas?

26:28.440 --> 26:30.010
Am I right, Tech?

26:30.160 --> 26:32.288
It's been a long-ass time
since we heard that.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.882
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, nigga.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.645
We killed 25 dudes this month, man.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.522
So, if y'all so fuckin' real,

26:43.840 --> 26:45.842
why ain't I never seent you before?

26:46.360 --> 26:47.771
- Well...
- Oh!

26:47.920 --> 26:49.445
That's because...

26:49.600 --> 26:51.011
I don't know,

26:51.160 --> 26:55.370
maybe we didn't wanna be seent.

26:58.720 --> 26:59.721
Wait a minute.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.730
Y'all them Allentown niggas, ain't you?

27:03.880 --> 27:05.166
- Us? Yes.
- Nah.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.810
- Yes, Techtonic.
- Yeah, what?

27:06.960 --> 27:08.724
Nigga, yes, we them Allentown niggas.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

27:10.200 --> 27:11.201
This nigga acting like

27:11.360 --> 27:13.408
- he got amnesia up here, fucking around.
- Crazy.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.608
Shit.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.766
Why didn't y'all say something
earlier, man?

27:19.680 --> 27:22.047
We was tryin' to stay incognito.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.765
You gotta keep 'em on their toes!

27:27.480 --> 27:29.244
Oh, damn.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.045
Why don't y'all come over here,
have a seat so we can talk?

27:33.200 --> 27:34.611
Okay, yeah.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.609
You know, uh...

27:40.800 --> 27:43.565
I heard how it went down
at King Diaz's church.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.444
That was some cold shit.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.849
You know, man, that's how we do.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.401
You know, we gots to do, how we do.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.726
Oh, damn!

27:51.880 --> 27:53.496
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about her, man.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.521
That's Montana.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.245
All right.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.842
Hey, man, you know,
as much as I love snakes,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.685
I think we need to go
to the bathroom real quick

28:02.840 --> 28:03.887
and drain ours.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.771
Well played, yep. That's what
we should do. Mmm-hmm.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.445
Oh, look who's up from their nap.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.886
Hey.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.086
Cute cat.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.846
Uh, yeah. This is my nigga,
New Jack, right here, man.

28:24.040 --> 28:27.529
Yup. Hey, but, look, before y'all go
run off and do your little tinkle...

28:27.760 --> 28:29.285
Where'd you get him?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.563
Seems to me,

28:36.800 --> 28:39.883
no stupid-ass nigga in his right mind

28:40.040 --> 28:42.486
would let a cat like that go willy-nilly.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.961
The fuck?

28:44.320 --> 28:46.402
How much you want for him?

28:46.760 --> 28:47.966
He serious?

28:48.640 --> 28:50.165
Actually, he is, man.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.244
We in the market right now
for a gangsta pet, so...

28:54.600 --> 28:56.967
Oh, well, he ain't for sale.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.968
Everything has a price.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.685
At a pet store.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.486
But this ain't no motherfucking
pet store, nigga.

29:04.640 --> 29:05.721
Well, that's a shame.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.001
Um...

29:07.240 --> 29:09.163
Thank you for sharing your time.

29:09.320 --> 29:10.810
I said,

29:11.640 --> 29:13.961
everything has its price.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.081
Well, shit. I mean, damn.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.447
Y'all drive a hard-ass bargain.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.162
All right. Hey.
I'll be right back, pimpin'.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.607
I wanna show y'all something. Come on.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.525
Come on.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.887
I don't know if y'all know
what we slinging these days.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.680
Holy Shit.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.282
Holy shit, indeed.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.530
Nah, man.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.371
That's what it's called, man. Holy Shit.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.171
Only you ain't heard of it yet
because it's new.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.005
And we the only ones that got it in LA.

29:56.880 --> 29:57.961
What you're looking at

29:58.120 --> 30:00.487
is a cross between PCP,

30:00.640 --> 30:03.723
MDMA and DMT.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.926
I mean...

30:06.520 --> 30:09.569
One puff of this, and holy shit!

30:09.720 --> 30:10.926
It's like you...

30:13.560 --> 30:15.528
Smokin' crack with God.

30:17.400 --> 30:21.405
So, uh, maybe y'all can accompany
these fools on a run.

30:21.560 --> 30:24.404
You know, show 'em how y'all
get down over in Allentown.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.163
Well, you know, actually, though, um...

30:28.320 --> 30:30.288
- Like a run, run?
- Yeah.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.169
You do that,

30:33.080 --> 30:36.129
I'll give you New Jack
as a gesture of respect.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.764
Wow. But, unfortunately, we...

30:39.920 --> 30:41.445
Deal.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.170
Deal. Y'all hear that?

30:44.400 --> 30:46.084
They gonna shadow you.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.240
So you make sure you listen to
every word they say

30:48.360 --> 30:49.816
and you take it as gospel, you understand?

30:49.840 --> 30:52.726
But right quick, though, right quick,
though, Cheddar, seriously, man.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.882
I just was thinking about
what's been going on.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.367
As recently, our docket is full, nigga...

30:57.520 --> 30:59.966
And at the same time, Cheddar,

31:00.120 --> 31:04.444
if I can get a moment
to discuss with my colleague.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.963
Let's go, let's go, let's go, now!

31:07.120 --> 31:08.256
It doesn't have to be that hard.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.936
I will not sell drugs.
I can't sell drugs, Rell.

31:09.960 --> 31:10.961
This was your idea.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.416
You were the one that wanted
to come here, man.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.441
All right, listen.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.961
You were the one who said
we were the Allentown niggas.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.645
I am not breaking the law.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.689
It's easy. It's easy, though. It's easy!

31:19.840 --> 31:21.336
- What's easy?
- I've seen Hulka do this.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.567
He just stands there. People want drugs.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.803
We just feed them some
bullshit about New Jack City,

31:26.960 --> 31:28.086
and we just get Keanu.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.442
I'm not jeopardizing my family
by selling drugs, okay?

31:30.600 --> 31:31.761
- Or...
- Or?

31:31.920 --> 31:33.729
- Maybe you'll like it.
- What?

31:33.880 --> 31:35.296
Maybe you'll like
being a bad motherfucker.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.481
No, no.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.483
- You're good at it.
- What?

31:38.640 --> 31:41.291
And it's just team building.
This is what you do.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.249
I don't do team building for drug rings.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.481
I do it for corporate...

31:44.640 --> 31:46.480
- Ever hear of corporate crime?
- That's not...

31:46.560 --> 31:48.130
- Y'all ready?
- Yeah.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.805
Yeah.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.610
Good. Let's go.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.564
You ready, Shark Tank?

31:54.640 --> 31:55.641
Yeah.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.121
I'm fuckin' ready, Techtonic.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.851
Sup, sup?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.371
Finders keepers, yo.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.045
Hey, keep your distance, yo.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.009
No, no, no. Know what I'm saying?

32:26.160 --> 32:27.889
No, don't shut that door. No, no, no.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.042
I'm about to leave, anyway, so...

32:31.800 --> 32:33.290
All right, y'all.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.851
Gather 'round and whatnot.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.444
So, seriously, what's gonna happen now

32:37.640 --> 32:39.722
before we get on this job,
it's time for us to all

32:39.880 --> 32:41.564
get to know each other
a little bit better.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.324
We gonna go in a circle, first of all,

32:43.520 --> 32:44.885
and everyone gonna say their name

32:45.040 --> 32:46.440
and then two things about yourself.

32:46.720 --> 32:47.881
For instance.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.328
My name is Shark Tank.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.761
And I ran hurdles in high school.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.564
And I like to hold my gun like this.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.129
So, that's me.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.962
I'm Techtonic.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.530
- I once shot two dudes with one bullet.
- Blam.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.563
And I went to a exclusive,

33:05.720 --> 33:07.802
early screening of
The Blair Witch Project.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.047
- You did?
- Yeah.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.247
I did not know that. See?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.376
That was before we even knew
if it was real or not.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.562
That's right. People thought
that shit was real.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.285
Go on, nigga.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.160
I'm Bud.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.282
And I got into gang bangin'
after I got stabbed by my moms.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.249
I'm gonna need two things, though.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.246
And my grandma.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.731
Well, you know, them family reunions
get crazy sometimes, man.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.120
Thanks for sharing, brother.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.924
Whassup? I'm Trunk.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.605
I got a knock-out left hook.

33:35.800 --> 33:36.881
Mmm-hmm.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.081
I got my name

33:38.280 --> 33:40.576
because I accidentally locked
my car keys in my trunk once.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.840
- It happens to the best of us, dawg.
- With a dead body.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.646
Okay.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.806
Yeah, well, you know,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.446
Trunk is a better name than Dead Body.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.010
Let's move on. What about you?

33:57.160 --> 33:58.207
Yeah.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.891
Stitches.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.081
And?

34:02.240 --> 34:03.844
Two things about yourself?

34:07.240 --> 34:08.650
Nah, nigga.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.290
Okay, you know what, Shark Tank?

34:10.480 --> 34:12.447
I think, in his own way,

34:12.600 --> 34:14.329
Stitches did share something
about hisself.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.005
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.322
- We should move on.
- Yeah, okay.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.170
I'm Hi-C.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.810
First off, uh, I don't like
niggas I don't know.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.643
Second, I'm real curious

34:25.800 --> 34:29.121
about what exactly went down
at the Diaz church massacre.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.440
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.521
Okay.

34:33.679 --> 34:36.206
Now we all know things about each other.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.806
So, let's knock this job out real quick.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.770
Was it really like the word on the street?

34:44.440 --> 34:46.283
What was the word on the streets?

34:46.440 --> 34:48.886
Blood bath. Hundred executions.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.565
- Yeah.
- Yeah, at least 100.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.801
Hundred, 101.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.335
And you ran up the wall
and did a back flip,

34:54.360 --> 34:56.089
and came down
and was still shooting niggas.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.361
Mmm.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.363
Damn straight. Did that, too.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.681
Well, show us.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.923
- Hmm?
- Show us!

35:03.120 --> 35:04.201
- The flip, hmm?
- Yeah.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.331
- I think we'd all like to see that.
- Um...

35:09.440 --> 35:13.161
All right, let me explain
somethin' to y'all real quick.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.687
It ain't gonna be like you think.

35:16.360 --> 35:19.250
Cheddar already told y'all,
we ain't here...

35:19.440 --> 35:21.408
Oh!

35:21.680 --> 35:23.808
Damn, nigga! You see that shit?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.485
He did it. He flipped it?

35:27.120 --> 35:28.121
He flipped it.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.480
Bring it in right here, homie.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.170
Whoo! All right!

35:31.720 --> 35:33.484
It's like black Jesus up in here.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.085
That's what I'm talking about.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.924
Oh, my God! I just did a flip. Oh, my God!

35:37.080 --> 35:39.082
Shit! That shit is crazy.

35:39.840 --> 35:43.811
So next time we tell y'all
we did somethin',

35:44.800 --> 35:47.883
take our word that we did somethin'.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.730
- Now let's see you do it.
- Yeah.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.245
- What?
- Sorry?

35:51.400 --> 35:53.129
Your turn, nigga.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.370
Only he's flippin' today.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.090
Only I'm flippin' today, y'all.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.526
We alternate flip days.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.162
Okay, today's the day
where I'm gonna be doin' all the flips.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.970
Y'all ain't gonna see him flip today.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.090
I'll flip the fuck
outta that shit tomorrow.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.241
Ooh, yeah!

36:09.400 --> 36:10.606
Hey!

36:10.760 --> 36:13.081
Let's flip the subject
and go flip some Holy Shit.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.287
- Okay?
- Hells yeah, dirt.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.856
- Let's take care of that.
- Exactly.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.451
Yo, everybody won't fit into my car.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.087
My brothers. My brothers.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.000
Come on, just tell me
what you want from me.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.447
Look, take anything. It's all yours, okay?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.125
Okay? Hey, y'all like weed?

36:26.280 --> 36:28.521
Just untie me, I'll go get it for you.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.603
Fuck! No!

36:30.760 --> 36:32.967
No! Come on! I didn't do shit!

36:33.120 --> 36:34.281
I wouldn't...

36:34.440 --> 36:35.771
Oh, shit.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.610
I'm the fuckin' cat, aren't I?

36:37.760 --> 36:39.808
That's what you're gonna do to me.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.610
I ain't scared.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.650
The cat? The cat...

36:46.800 --> 36:48.086
You're looking for Keanu?

36:48.240 --> 36:51.449
The cat's at Hot Party Vixens.
You know, that strip club downtown.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.369
You guys, don't kill me.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.927
I fuckin' know everything about hip-hop.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.411
Yo, Shark, no disrespecting, now, man,

37:08.200 --> 37:10.089
but why you drive this weak-ass van?

37:10.280 --> 37:15.241
You wanna get caught,
go ahead, drive a little drug car.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.450
But you wanna never get pulled over again,

37:18.920 --> 37:21.491
you drive a inconspicuous family vehicle.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.962
Inconspicuous, least hardcore,

37:25.120 --> 37:28.841
motherfuckin' soccer mom,
Full House thing.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.684
Where we goin' again?

37:30.840 --> 37:32.360
Just head towards the Hollywood Hills.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.925
I'll guide you from there.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.687
Wordness to the turdness.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.970
Here we are.

37:51.920 --> 37:52.921
You comin'?

37:57.440 --> 37:58.521
Nah.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.885
You got this.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.371
Nah. Fuck that. You comin' with.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.480
Cheddar said you was gonna
show me how to do this.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.005
Yeah, go ahead, Techtonic.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.766
I'ma show these guys how to keep watch.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.005
Thank you, Shark Tank.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.440
You're more than welcome, nigga.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.086
Come on. We gotta get this over with, man.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.323
Don't worry about it, baby.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.409
Ain't no thang.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.729
Ain't no thang.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.724
Watch and learn.

38:39.960 --> 38:43.089
Hi!

39:09.240 --> 39:12.608
Ah! Yay! You guys are here!

39:12.760 --> 39:14.205
Oh, finally!

39:15.000 --> 39:16.365
What's up?

39:17.480 --> 39:20.131
Somebody order some drugs?

39:21.640 --> 39:23.802
Yes! Oh, my God!

39:24.000 --> 39:26.810
I was just telling these guys

39:26.960 --> 39:30.203
about this job that I did in
Paris for a couple of months,

39:30.360 --> 39:32.283
and this guy, he let me
smoke some of this stuff.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.762
And I swear to God, this drug is insane.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.251
And the beauty is,

39:37.720 --> 39:40.007
every trip is different!

39:40.200 --> 39:43.682
Ha! Can I please see it?

39:43.840 --> 39:47.128
Ooh. Backpack. Backpack.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.122
Got a neat little backpack.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.968
Yes!

39:54.160 --> 39:56.322
Oh, my God, yes!

39:56.600 --> 39:58.284
Come on, please, please, please! Come sit.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.204
Have a drink. Sit down!

40:00.360 --> 40:02.488
Sorry, we just want to see the money.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.842
You see, Donnie,

40:12.080 --> 40:14.970
some people don't respect the game.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.606
What game?

40:16.880 --> 40:18.120
Life!

40:18.760 --> 40:21.286
Life is a fuckin' game!

40:21.480 --> 40:22.845
And the only real question is,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.890
who are the players
and who are the pieces?

40:26.040 --> 40:28.202
Come on, you guys.
Let's smoke some Holy Shit.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.561
No, no, no.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.805
Thought I made myself clear.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.610
We're not interested.

40:52.480 --> 40:53.481
Man, fuck!

40:53.640 --> 40:55.608
Let's get some tunes
goin' in this motherfucker.

40:55.800 --> 40:56.936
- Something, man.
- Tunes, man, yeah.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.849
Fuck, yeah. Let's see what we got here.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.200
- I know you got some killer shit.
- Actually, no, we...

41:02.520 --> 41:04.204
What? Yo.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.967
Yo, Shark Tank, my nigga. Um...

41:08.960 --> 41:12.726
What the fuck is this?

41:14.960 --> 41:16.769
Oh...

41:18.040 --> 41:20.088
Shit, niggas!

41:20.240 --> 41:22.527
This my shit right here!

41:23.080 --> 41:24.241
This your shit?

41:25.240 --> 41:27.288
This shit sound kinda white.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.491
- White? White?
- Yeah.

41:29.640 --> 41:32.166
Niggas, this is
George Michael, right here.

41:32.320 --> 41:35.927
All right? This one of the greatest
recording artists of all time, man.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.162
This the real OG up in here.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.526
So,

41:40.200 --> 41:41.611
he black, then?

41:42.760 --> 41:45.081
You know, he light-skinned.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.846
And then, he used to roll
with this nigga, Ridgeley.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.001
Yeah.

41:49.160 --> 41:52.004
And then, George Michael
was trying to do that solo thing, right?

41:52.160 --> 41:53.730
And then, wham!

41:54.480 --> 41:59.327
Then nobody never see Ridgeley ever again.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.922
He killed the motherfucker?

42:02.440 --> 42:03.680
Nobody

42:04.400 --> 42:05.606
ever

42:06.120 --> 42:07.360
seen

42:08.000 --> 42:09.525
him

42:09.720 --> 42:11.290
again.

42:11.840 --> 42:12.841
Shit.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.684
I'll fuck with that nigga.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.530
I'll fuck with him.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.808
- Hey, hey, y'all.
- If he start that shit.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.930
Wait till y'all hear
this next track, though, dirt.

42:22.880 --> 42:23.881
You know,

42:24.040 --> 42:26.407
in samurai times,

42:27.120 --> 42:28.485
a refusal

42:28.960 --> 42:31.088
to sit at a man's court

42:31.240 --> 42:34.210
was considered a profound
insult to his honor.

42:38.560 --> 42:41.928
Ha! I'm just fucking with you!

42:42.120 --> 42:43.804
You should have seen your face.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.210
Oh, my God.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.488
Oh, that was amazing.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.801
Mmm.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.925
Crazy.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.161
Whoo!

42:53.920 --> 42:56.526
The man asked for the money.

42:56.680 --> 42:57.841
Yeah.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.690
Rachel, get the bag.

43:02.520 --> 43:03.521
I'm not your slave.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.324
Get the fucking bag!

43:11.200 --> 43:12.201
Ooh!

43:14.160 --> 43:16.970
I loved you in
The House Bunny, by the way.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.243
- Thank you, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.243
You know this chick?

43:22.200 --> 43:24.123
It's Anna Faris, the actress.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.686
She's in movies?

43:26.960 --> 43:28.724
Lost in Translation?

43:29.240 --> 43:31.368
Chipwrecked? The Squeakquel?

43:32.800 --> 43:33.961
Scary Movie?

43:34.120 --> 43:35.645
Oh... You in that movie?

43:35.840 --> 43:37.763
Scary Movie 1, 2, 3 and 4.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.604
Not 5. Too old.

43:39.800 --> 43:40.801
Hmm.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.650
But, enough! Enough! Enough!

43:42.800 --> 43:45.929
No more Hollywood talk.
I'm so sick of this bullshit.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.726
- Yeah.
- All I care about

43:49.520 --> 43:51.010
is truth.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.291
Or dare.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.010
Truth or dare!

44:05.600 --> 44:08.490
Yo, that chorus do kick in nice, though.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.722
It does, don't it? Yeah, yeah. I mean,

44:10.880 --> 44:12.848
y'all hear the father figure part, right?

44:13.040 --> 44:14.201
Because, my man right here,

44:14.360 --> 44:17.489
he didn't have his own
positive male role model in his life.

44:17.640 --> 44:18.846
So...

44:19.000 --> 44:20.001
Damn!

44:20.160 --> 44:21.525
Yo, I never knew my daddy.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.324
- Really?
- No.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.722
Man, George Michael the shit, man!

44:55.920 --> 44:57.684
- Right, dawg?
- Right on, man.

44:57.880 --> 44:59.120
Love that man.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.602
Truth.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.451
What is

45:04.600 --> 45:07.843
the dirtiest, most fucked-up
thing you've ever done?

45:09.440 --> 45:10.441
Mmm...

45:12.000 --> 45:13.809
You know, you don't have to...

45:13.960 --> 45:16.964
This dude cheated on my sister
and I cut his dick off.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.969
Oh... Uh...

45:20.800 --> 45:22.484
Fuck, yeah!

45:22.640 --> 45:26.008
That is the kind of shit
you should get paid for.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.051
Thank you.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.481
Okay, your turn, same question.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.723
Most fucked-up?

45:38.920 --> 45:41.400
I once cut two dicks off.

45:42.840 --> 45:45.081
Yeah, that's right.

45:46.440 --> 45:47.851
They didn't even see it coming.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.001
Snuck up on them.

45:49.160 --> 45:51.242
Got real close.

45:52.080 --> 45:55.323
One of them was long, thin, pointy,
like a pencil.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.884
The other one was short, girthy.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.683
Had a little bit of heft to it.

46:04.360 --> 46:09.048
Got up in there lickety-split,
snip, snip, yeah.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.644
I took them, too.

46:12.800 --> 46:16.407
So, yeah, I'm a motherfuckin' dick-taker.

46:22.160 --> 46:25.369
300 for the dick-taker.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.566
Okay.

46:31.880 --> 46:34.963
- So, Allentown...
- What? Nigga, fuck, what? Nigga.

46:35.120 --> 46:36.536
Tell me about it, man. Was it crazy?

46:36.560 --> 46:37.561
Surely should have been.

46:37.720 --> 46:38.721
Was it...

46:38.880 --> 46:41.531
Hells bells, hold on
to your shells, nigga.

46:41.680 --> 46:43.682
Shit was crazy, shit was crazy.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.242
We was just dodging bullets
on a everyday basis.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.402
You know, just for survival.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.601
But, you know, the thing
about me and Techtonic,

46:52.760 --> 46:54.569
is our communication skills.

46:54.720 --> 46:57.291
That's the backbone of our teamwork.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.003
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.366
I get that.

47:01.520 --> 47:02.760
All right.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.845
- You know what?
- Mmm.

47:07.280 --> 47:09.886
I never told y'all niggas how I got this.

47:12.200 --> 47:15.124
A kid stabbed me
'cause I stole his Ring Pop.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.009
That's awful, man.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.685
How old were you?

47:19.840 --> 47:20.921
Twenty-three.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.926
Oh. Okay. Well...

47:24.440 --> 47:26.204
Yeah, thank you for sharing, though.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.925
That felt good.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.885
I got one, too. Check it out.

47:30.040 --> 47:31.120
Okay, yeah. Let's see that.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.287
Buckshot.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.485
Holding up a liquor store.

47:34.640 --> 47:35.846
Oh, man.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.569
And then he shot you, man. That's crazy.

47:39.720 --> 47:42.291
Nah, actually, it made the news,

47:42.440 --> 47:44.841
and when I got back to my
grandmamma house, she shot me.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.656
Okay, you know, you need to spend
a little less time with your family.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.091
I'm gonna advise that.

47:49.560 --> 47:50.840
- Hell, yeah.
- So, what you got?

47:50.880 --> 47:53.281
- Me? Oh, okay, let me, um...
- Yeah, yeah.

47:54.880 --> 47:57.281
Come on, man.
You got a bunch of shit, man.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.080
- Here it is.
- You ain't gotta be modest.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.205
A damn-ass street fight.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.606
Appendix.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.126
Blam...

48:07.440 --> 48:08.441
Your appendix?

48:08.600 --> 48:10.443
- They took it out of my body.
- What?

48:10.640 --> 48:12.005
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.725
Y'all don't even want to hear about

48:13.880 --> 48:15.723
what went down with my wisdom teeth.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.211
- Shit.
- Damn.

48:17.920 --> 48:18.967
Truth or dare?

48:19.320 --> 48:20.321
Dare.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.369
Why would you choose dare?

48:22.520 --> 48:23.806
Hmm...

48:24.960 --> 48:27.281
I dare you

48:29.880 --> 48:31.041
to shoot your friend.

48:33.320 --> 48:34.446
You jokin'.

48:34.640 --> 48:35.971
She's jokin'.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.365
You know she's jokin', right?

48:39.560 --> 48:40.766
I'm not joking.

48:41.160 --> 48:43.288
That's $10,000.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.001
What?

48:47.160 --> 48:48.207
Hey.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.447
Show us what it looks like

48:54.600 --> 48:56.841
to see a man's brains explode.

48:58.440 --> 48:59.646
Hey.

49:00.200 --> 49:02.328
Fuck it! He ain't my friend.

49:02.480 --> 49:05.211
Hey! Fuck. Yo, Hi-C!

49:06.680 --> 49:09.126
Don't let white girl tear us apart, Hi-C.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.800
This is fuckin' black-on-black violence.
This is how it happens.

49:12.160 --> 49:15.130
Don't fuckin'
let Anna Faris tear us apart!

49:15.280 --> 49:18.204
Yes, come on.
Show us what death looks like.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.124
Come on.

49:21.560 --> 49:23.881
Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.565
Do it, do it, do it.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.290
Do it, do it.

49:27.560 --> 49:28.561
Do it!

49:28.880 --> 49:30.166
Fuck that!

49:30.680 --> 49:32.170
The fuck is wrong with you?

49:32.360 --> 49:33.521
Get it, then!

49:34.320 --> 49:36.561
- What?
- Get the cash, motherfucker!

49:38.160 --> 49:40.447
You broke my nose!

49:41.720 --> 49:43.051
Look, look, look!

49:48.040 --> 49:50.247
You fucking peasant!

49:52.400 --> 49:53.686
Crazy bitch!

49:55.760 --> 49:58.331
Bring your ass here, little Wendy!

50:00.600 --> 50:01.965
Come on. Let's go!

50:34.800 --> 50:35.847
Move!

50:36.000 --> 50:37.445
Get in the back!

50:38.160 --> 50:39.207
Move it!

50:41.280 --> 50:42.725
Drive!

50:42.880 --> 50:44.484
I gotta start the car.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.605
You good?

50:50.920 --> 50:52.410
Come on. Drive!

50:53.520 --> 50:55.170
I said drive, motherfucker!

50:55.360 --> 50:56.407
I'm going, I'm going.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.120
- Seat belts and shit!
- Come on, y'all.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.322
What the fuck is y'all singing?

51:01.480 --> 51:02.686
George Michael.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.880
Shit, don't break the goddamn van.

51:11.480 --> 51:14.927
- Oh, Stitches!
- No, no.

51:15.080 --> 51:16.684
You ain't gonna hit nobody.

51:16.880 --> 51:17.881
Oh, there it goes!

51:18.040 --> 51:19.246
We still got this party shit

51:19.400 --> 51:20.686
- goin' on later or what?
- Yeah.

51:20.840 --> 51:21.976
We're going downstairs in a second.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.120
Don't even worry about that.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.120
About time you passed that shit, eh?

51:25.200 --> 51:26.536
Here's the thing, man. I was, like...

51:26.560 --> 51:29.211
Just say some... Yeah, dawg?

51:29.680 --> 51:32.650
Shark Tank, can I catch
your ear for a second?

51:32.800 --> 51:34.165
All right, dawg!

51:34.360 --> 51:36.124
To be continued, y'all.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.685
All right.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.683
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, Stitches.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.729
Nah!

51:42.600 --> 51:46.849
I gotta tell you, I'm having an amazing
time, and these are not bad people.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.202
Clarence, Clarence, they're bad people.

51:49.360 --> 51:50.616
- No, no...
- They're very, very bad.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.136
Okay. They're drug dealers,
and I get all of that...

51:52.160 --> 51:53.491
Listen to me. Listen to me.

51:53.640 --> 51:55.216
- In the mansion, earlier...
- Yeah, yeah.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.685
Hey! Shark!

51:56.880 --> 51:58.689
Shark Tank! Come here!

51:58.880 --> 52:00.564
Shut the fuck up, nigga.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.690
Dumb motherfucker.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.696
Okay. We'll just have
a couple more drinks,

52:04.720 --> 52:06.800
and then we'll just go see
where Cheddar's at, right?

52:07.360 --> 52:09.010
I never get to go out. I never go out.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.720
I am doing something that Hannah asked.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.046
This is for my marriage.

52:12.200 --> 52:13.964
These drinks are for my marriage.

52:14.520 --> 52:15.726
Thank you. Thank you so much.

52:15.880 --> 52:18.201
I cannot tell you how much
I appreciate that. All right.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.561
- Shark, you better hurry up!
- Listen up, niggas.

52:20.720 --> 52:23.087
We about to be out this motherfucker.

52:23.480 --> 52:24.720
- Oh!
- You good?

52:29.720 --> 52:31.643
You got me on that one.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.571
You good, though?

52:36.920 --> 52:38.524
Yeah, I'm good.

52:40.680 --> 52:42.250
You good?

52:42.480 --> 52:44.244
Yeah. I'm good.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.921
Shit got crazy back there, huh?

52:52.280 --> 52:54.487
You ain't never seen
nobody get killed before?

52:54.720 --> 52:56.768
Me?

52:56.920 --> 52:59.400
Yeah, I've seen people get killed before,

52:59.560 --> 53:00.766
by me.

53:02.600 --> 53:05.922
I was just trying to say that,
usually in Allentown,

53:06.080 --> 53:08.924
we handle our business
a little bit more professionally.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.602
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

53:16.760 --> 53:17.966
You, uh...

53:18.560 --> 53:20.483
You ever think about gettin' out the game?

53:21.360 --> 53:22.407
No.

53:24.200 --> 53:25.804
That's a shame.

53:26.560 --> 53:30.884
I would imagine that
it's a tough job for a woman to be here.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.880
Not that you can't,

53:35.040 --> 53:37.486
because a woman can do
anything a man can do, but...

53:37.640 --> 53:38.846
Yeah.

53:39.600 --> 53:43.366
You think if I get out the game, niggas
gonna stop thinkin' they own bitches?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.804
Well, I'm not like that.

53:48.480 --> 53:49.641
You're not?

53:49.800 --> 53:50.961
Nah.

53:53.320 --> 53:55.561
I bet you, out there somewhere

53:55.960 --> 53:59.407
there's a non-gangster motherfucker

54:00.480 --> 54:02.482
that'd be real lucky to have you.

54:03.520 --> 54:04.851
I mean...

54:06.840 --> 54:08.683
You look kind of like

54:10.160 --> 54:12.162
the female lion in The Lion King.

54:12.320 --> 54:13.367
Nala.

54:13.560 --> 54:16.296
That's crazy that you say that,
because it's, like, my favorite cartoon.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.322
- Really?
- Yeah, and I'm a Leo.

54:18.520 --> 54:19.760
That's crazy how you knew that.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.484
You must be psychic or somethin'.

54:21.640 --> 54:23.563
Wow.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.880
You don't want to get mixed up
with a dude like me.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.724
I'm a wanderer.

54:32.880 --> 54:33.961
Oh, you gay.

54:34.160 --> 54:35.685
- No.
- Yeah.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.569
Why you think I'm gay, though?

54:37.720 --> 54:39.210
I'm just messing with you, man.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.885
I know you not gay.

54:41.640 --> 54:43.210
How do you know?

54:43.360 --> 54:45.249
I could tell you like girls.

54:46.840 --> 54:48.001
Good.

54:49.200 --> 54:51.521
I wanna thank you for earlier.

54:52.280 --> 54:53.361
Really?

54:54.680 --> 54:56.603
Like, for what?

54:56.760 --> 54:58.171
For helping me kill those people.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.526
Yeah. Well, I...

54:59.680 --> 55:02.206
No. No. I...

55:02.400 --> 55:03.765
I ain't help you kill them people.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.524
You did that on your own.

55:05.680 --> 55:07.444
It's kind of like we killed them together.

55:07.600 --> 55:12.891
Nah, I think it's more like
you murdered them on your own.

55:13.560 --> 55:16.609
Mmm. But I couldn't have
done it without you.

55:17.400 --> 55:21.450
Agree to disagree with that one.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.523
We killed them together.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.443
Well, legally speaking,

55:27.520 --> 55:29.124
I did not help you.

55:31.080 --> 55:32.241
Mmm...

55:33.600 --> 55:34.761
You all right?

55:34.920 --> 55:35.921
I didn't...

55:36.600 --> 55:37.761
You was kind of close.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.046
Yeah.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.126
Got my trick knee.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.936
Why don't we go ahead
and finish this downstairs?

55:42.960 --> 55:44.849
Mmm-hmm. You wanna... I go first.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.047
Yeah. Go on.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.280
Come on, y'all.
Let's go to this party, man.

55:48.400 --> 55:49.840
- Hell, yeah.
- You heard her, y'all.

55:49.880 --> 55:51.928
Niggas is in here caking and shit.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.482
Allentown!

56:38.160 --> 56:39.650
Whoo!

56:43.480 --> 56:46.131
Excuse me. Can I come
through here for a second?

56:46.280 --> 56:47.850
Excuse me!

56:50.000 --> 56:51.206
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

56:51.800 --> 56:53.484
We said one drink!

56:53.680 --> 56:55.682
Hey, but we're turning it out, man!

56:55.840 --> 56:58.047
It's not "turn out," it's "turn up"!

56:58.200 --> 56:59.964
And it's time to turn down, man!

57:00.120 --> 57:01.531
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

57:01.680 --> 57:03.887
Okay. I see what's going on.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.202
You're just mad
because they like Shark Tank

57:06.400 --> 57:07.731
more than they like Techtonic!

57:07.880 --> 57:09.166
What? No, no!

57:09.360 --> 57:11.328
I'm sorry.
I just have a lot of personality.

57:11.480 --> 57:12.936
I don't know what to tell you, brother.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.803
- What?
- What?

57:14.960 --> 57:17.247
First of all, I don't care

57:17.400 --> 57:19.402
if they like Shark Tank
more than Techtonic.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.050
They're murderers!

57:21.680 --> 57:22.681
All right.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.171
Second of all, no, they don't!

57:24.320 --> 57:25.560
Yo, Tank!

57:26.520 --> 57:27.726

57:27.920 --> 57:29.206

Hey, Stitches, man.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.725
Let me show you how we
smoke weed in Allentown.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.930
Aight.

57:49.080 --> 57:51.606
That's my boy, right there.
He know how to do it right.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.728
- Yo, Shark Tank!
- Yeah, dawg?

57:53.880 --> 57:56.087
Your turn, my nigga!

57:57.400 --> 57:58.890
Well, you know,

57:59.040 --> 58:01.725
I'm more one of them
pipe-smokin' niggas, you know.

58:01.880 --> 58:03.086
You say a pipe?

58:03.240 --> 58:04.241
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

58:04.400 --> 58:06.926
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you. Yeah.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.127
Here we go.

58:11.240 --> 58:12.241
Yeah.

58:12.400 --> 58:14.243
Gonna heat it up. Heat it on up.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.241
Ooh. It's gonna be delicious.

58:19.640 --> 58:21.404
Yeah.

58:21.600 --> 58:25.207
Yo, I almost forgot.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.845
Just got this done out back.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.883
Oh...

58:29.560 --> 58:30.721

58:30.880 --> 58:33.611
That's actually the best tattoo

58:33.760 --> 58:34.841
Me, too, man. Me, too.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.331
You want some, dawg?

58:36.640 --> 58:39.610
Nah. I don't fuck with that Holy Shit.

58:39.760 --> 58:40.841
Yo, you all right?

58:42.760 --> 58:44.285

58:55.320 --> 58:56.845
Holy shit.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.321
I think maybe we should go,
like, lay down somewhere.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.406
Yo, nigga, you floatin'!

59:32.320 --> 59:33.890
Am I in Heaven?

59:55.000 --> 59:56.809
You're George Michael.

59:57.400 --> 59:59.641
You're George Michael, man.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.010
No. That's my favorite fucking song.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.320
That's it. I like when you do that...

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.408
That thing. That leg thing. That's my jam.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.727
Oh, no, I can't.
There's no way I can spin.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.405
No, I can't do it.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.090
What? Oh... There it is.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.245
Oh, it's so good.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.364
George.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.010
I have faith.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.565
Hello?

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.681
Oh.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.081
Hello, Clarence. It's me,

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.561
Keanu.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.721
Meow.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.126
Wait.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.247
Are you...

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.520
Keanu Reeves?

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.967
Yeah.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.248
I'm your spirit teacher.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.006
People can't be excellent to you

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.562
unless you're being excellent to yourself.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.560
I don't understand. What does that mean?

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.721
Clarence,

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.882
it's time to wake up.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.841
Where you go from there
is a choice I leave to you.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.442
Oh. Right.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.170
The Matrix.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.846
Dude, all you need to remember is...

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.082
Oh...

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.206
I get it.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.210
Oh, let me get a picture...

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.966
Hannah!

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.167
Hi!

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.800
Hannah! Baby.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.961
Hi, baby.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.009
Oh, I miss you so much, baby.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.366
How are you?

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.000
Not good.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.440
Wait, where are you?

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.122
Oh, God. Oh... Huh?

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.089
What? No. I'm just out with Rell.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.321
I'm doing me!

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.642
- Are you at a club?
- Yeah.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.531
In fact, it's of the strip club variety,

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.409
and I've never done that,

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.643
and I'm just having some
really rugged fun, you know?

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.049
So, you're at a strip club
having rugged fun.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.009
Yeah. No, it's not like that.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.811
It's not about the degrading
of women or anything.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.689
I'm here for a very specific reason.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.081
And... No, that didn't sound right.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.287
I'm sorry.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.001
It's complicated.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.336
I'll explain it to you tomorrow.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.800
But it's all good. It's nothing bad.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.689
Okay. Okay. Whatever.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.841
But, baby...

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.048
This is what you said you wanted, right?

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.685
You said to have fun.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.251
Whatever, Clarence. Whatever.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.324
I just didn't think that
being in a strip club was your thing.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.006
Yeah, well, you know... Shit. I mean...

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.208
What'd you think my idea
of fun was, right?

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.567
It ain't like my fuckin'
lifestyle is some secret.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.688
Why are you talking to me like that?

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.564
- See about it, then.
- What?

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.480
I said, why are you
talking to me like that?

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.727
I've never heard you
talk to me like that before.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.087
I mean... I talk like that sometimes.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.083
Yeah. All right. Okay.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.685
Wait, what's wrong?

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.410
This is what you asked for, right?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.046
Fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.376
I didn't want to ruin your weekend.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.401
I just want you to know

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.688
that Spencer's been
a little inappropriate,

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.684
and I'm coming home tomorrow morning
instead of tomorrow night.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.924
Inappropriate?

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.609
Spencer was inappropriate how?

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.569
Let's just say he made me uncomfortable.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.563
I can't get into it right now.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.245
Baby, I gotta go.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.562
You better behave yourself, too. Bye.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.056
No, Hannah, please
don't hang up the phone.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.776
Can you just explain to me
what's going on right now?

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.290
Hannah!

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.771
Hannah!

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.570
Yo, this party is crazy!

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.801
Oh.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.330
Hey.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.801
You aight?

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.045
Yeah, nigga. Yeah.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.248
You know, just side bitch.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.926
Word, uh...

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.090
Well, Cheddar wants to holla at you.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.520
Cool, yeah.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.762
I'll let him know you're coming.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.125
So, uh...

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.764
Hi-C tells me
y'all some bad motherfuckers.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.566
Even taught my goons some new tricks.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.321
Yeah, we taught them
how we do things in Allentown.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.211
Yeah, well, um...

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.204
I got a big exchange tomorrow. I need you.

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.966
Help keep shit 100.
You know what I'm saying?

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.690
After that,

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.806
- New Jack here is yours.
- Um...

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.481
I think we'd prefer to stick
to the original arrangement.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.971
You know what I'm saying?

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.491
Okay, I see.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.925
Driving up the price.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.642
Okay, 10 G's plus New Jack.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.886
Nah.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.441
Cheddar.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.211
We just want the cat.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.684
Shark Tank and I,
we getting a little sleepy.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.441
Sleepy?

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.490
Hell, yeah, nigga, we sleepy.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.528
And when them Allentown niggas get tired,

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.290
we gotta catch some Z's,

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.205
or else Allentown niggas get cranky.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.247
20.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.165
Straight up.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.449
Now, I know y'all ain't
gonna turn down 20 G's.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.047
I mean, shit.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.204
That's a lot of money even by
Allentown standards, right?

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.881
Well...

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.646
Let me tell you about Allentown standards.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.961
By Allentown standards,

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.730
when a nigga make a deal,

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.407
a nigga make a goddamn deal.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.967
Ooh... Shark...

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.566
And didn't nobody say nothing

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.530
about no exchange tomorrow.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.290
So, let me tell you
how it's gonna go down.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.084
You gonna give us our goddamn cat,

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.086
and we gonna be on our
goddamn way, Spencer!

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.526
Uh, Cheddar.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.761
Take pimpin' upstairs
to the office for me.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.764
- Give him some of that catnip he like.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.046
You know, um,

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.330
maybe, just maybe,

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.767
just take a little time
to think about my offer.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.849
We don't need time. We need...

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.087
Time is good.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.242
We need some time. You need some time.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.209
We'll take some. You take some.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.409
You do it here. We'll do it over here.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.409
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.056
This motherfucker trying to side wind us.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.376
What the fuck are you doing, Tech?

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.767
I'm not Tech. I'm not Tech.
I'm Rell. Clarence.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.604
Well, I was staying in character.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.570
What are you, Daniel Day-Lewis
all of a sudden? Come on, man!

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.609
Look, I spoke to Hannah on the phone,

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.331
- and she said that Spencer did something.
- What?

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.040
She wouldn't tell me, man. She hung up!

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.081
Okay...

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.965
It can't be that bad if she didn't say.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.489
You almost got us killed, man, okay?

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.290
Look, Keanu needs you.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.807
I need you. I need you.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.961
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.281
Okay. Then come on.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.601
Okay. I'm good. I'm good.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.802
All right. Let's get Keanu.
Let's get out of here.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.007
Yes.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.682
Watch the door. Keanu!

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.360
Keanu!

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.649
I said I was gonna take care of you.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.964
And I failed.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.569
But I'm here now.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.961
Get that off you.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.810
I'm here for you, buddy.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.411
I love you.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.081
Okay.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.084
All right, go, go, go. Just walk.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.166
I see. I get it now, because
when I stand up for myself,

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.816
that means I'm standing up
for Hannah and Belle,

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.216
and when I don't stand up for myself,
I'm not standing up for them.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.005
Clarence, you can keep on talking,
but just know, I think we just won.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.521
Oh.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.170
Oh, my gosh, you're right.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.731
Gosh, that was so weird, wasn't it?

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.560
I mean, we just walked right out of there.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.439
Biscuits.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.041
Hey, buddy.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.281
Hey.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.363
Oh... Fuck me.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.600
What?

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.404
Oh, you know what?

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.136
Guess you don't know who you messing with

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.640
because you being
crazy disrespectful right now.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.962
Hey! If you fucking touch
one hair on my cat's head,

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.167
I will kill you!

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.406
- Help!
- Never mind.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.251
Okay, yes, yes.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.536
Putting them down. Putting the guns down.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.015
Yes, that's good.
Yes, thank you, thank you!

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.087
- Hey.
- Thank you.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.564
- They like Keanu.
- That's good.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.881
We do, too. We like Keanu as well.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.729
Everybody here seems to like Keanu,

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.241
so we can agree on that, right, guys?

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.163
Hey, we're fun dudes. We're friends!

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.560
Please! What do you want from us?

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.603
- Oh, God!
- Oh, fuck.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.245
Oh, my God. Are those tiny penises?

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:27.447
No!

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.166
Please, Lord, let those be fingers.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:32.095
They're fucking fingers, man.
They're fucking fingers.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.406
Oh, my God!

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.844
Hey! Listen, if you let us go,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.416
I might be able to get you visitor passes

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.680
to a meeting of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.095
if they're not in a closed session!

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.121
Oh, my gosh!

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.607
That just worked.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.286
I don't fucking know how that worked.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.771
I have a friend. I have a friend.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.936
A friend of mine went to grade
school with the speechwriter

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.008
for John Kerry, a former
presidential candidate.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.600
Oh, my God. I think this is working.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.170
- No.
- Why would this be working?

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.881
I think that they
are going to murder us to death!

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.201
Oh, my God!

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.362
Lord save me now, please!

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.965
Oh, fuck.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.841
Keanu.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.962
No! What is that one?

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.327
- Why are you doing this?
- Buddy...

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.687
Gentlemen, please,
why can't we just talk about this?

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.966
Can't we just...

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.161
Okay, ready?

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.360
Just take a deep breath...

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.481
Get that bitch!

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.520
Get that bitch!

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.528
Get that bitch.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.250
Yeah, get that bitch!

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.530
Get that, bitch!

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.004
No, not the fucking knife.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.207
Man.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.521
I'm saying...

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.926
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.004
I don't know... Wait, wait, wait.
I think we're gonna need more time.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.376
Just give us a little bit more time.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.687
Sir, I'm begging you, please.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.736
Think about, dig in to
yourselves, into your souls.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.842
Why would you have to
do something like this?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.001
Please, no.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.491
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.240
Oh, my God.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.004
I got you!

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.089
Yes!

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.691
Yes! Yes! Oh, God, yes!

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.524
Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes, Rell.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.160
- Back up!
- Thank you, God, for this!

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.531
Back up!

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.489
Okay. Yes. We gotcha!

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.688
Fucking got you, motherfucker!

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.008
Just don't move, all right?

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.401
We're gonna take our cat,
and we're gonna be on our way!

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.005
- If you don't mind.
- Keanu!

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.207
- Keanu!
- Keanu!

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.921
Keanu!

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.891
Keanu!

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.724
Drop the fucking... Hey, back up!

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.689
What are you doing? Stop moving forward!

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.887
Stop walking!

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.087
Stop walking toward us!

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.401
Stay right there!

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.760
Why are you walking toward us?

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.046
Why are you walking toward us?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.770
Hey, knock it off! Knock it off!

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.287
We will fire these guns and
shoot bullets into your body.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.522
Count of three.
We gotta fucking shoot them.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.569
I can't shoot them!
I will not kill somebody.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.480
- Clarence, we gotta do it!
- I cannot do it!

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.607
Okay, one...

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.241
I said the count of three.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.526
I know. I'm sorry.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.576
- I said the count of three.
- I heard you say...

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.125
- Yeah.
- I heard it. Oh, my God!

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.611
We've killed people!

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.000
Why "we"?

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.400
Why "we"? No, you did it!

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.045
- What, no!
- I didn't shoot anybody.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.726
Okay.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.520
Okay, we just murdered those people.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.880
- That's okay. All right.
- Okay.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.764
- We should go. We should go.
- Ah...

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.331
Keanu!

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.811
Here, kitty, kitty!

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.206
Oh, God.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.964
Uh... Kitty, kitty!

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.285
Keanu!

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.688
Thought y'all motherfuckers was dead.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.721
Didn't say goodbye or nothing.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.723
Oh, and my cat, New Jack?

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.009
The one I would never give up
to two niggas like y'all?

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.770
He was gone, too.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.048
And now I see that you are, in fact,

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.806
holding that nigga New Jack as we speak.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.240
Hi-C,

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.085
get my cat.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.010
Hey, hey, you two!

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.921
What's that?

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.161
That?

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.010
That's just a nigga in the trunk, man.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.605
What you think?

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.400
Because that's how we roll, motherfucker.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.607
That's our car.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.683
We be putting niggas
in this trunk all the time.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.002
This the last day this
motherfucker's alive, man.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.161
Oh, shit! Don't kill me!

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.805
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.007
Oh, Rell!

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.685
Rell's cousin! Fuck!

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.080
Make sure you got your keys.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.486
Here's the deal, man.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.688
This nigga right here? He stole your cat.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.841
That's him.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.650
We just got your cat back for you.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.131
That is a hurtful lie!

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.281
Yo, Cheddar.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.441
That's Hulka.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.000
That's whose apartment that Trunk and Bud
stole the cat from.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.610
He probably tryin' to steal him back.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.444
Yo, it wasn't my place!
It was their place!

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.896
- There you go.
- That's what happened.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.729
Your girl know what's up.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.280
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.010
You don't need to...

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.641
Cheddar. Look,

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.936
I don't even know if you remember this.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.042
I met you at the club once. Hulka. Hulka.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.201
Look, come on, man...

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.361
Kill this motherfucker.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.688
- What? No! Come on, man!
- Kill him?

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.161
Like, end his life so
the motherfucker expires?

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.691
Take the soul out of his body?

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.560
But we can't do that,
and I'll tell you why.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.971
Because we don't have a gun.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.560
- We ain't got no guns.
- That's why.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.721
This...

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.448
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.216
- Thanks for the gun.
- I really appreciate it.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.376
You looking out, and that's why
I respect you, Cheddar.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.370
That was efficient as fuck. Um...

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.404
Hey, you know what, Techtonic?

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.925
What's that?

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.365
Do the honors, dawg.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.089
You one considerate motherfucker.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.481
- I do what I can, dirt.
- Just do it!

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.810
No, no, please don't!

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.936
Don't kill me. Don't shoot me!
I don't want to die.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.883
Come on, I just want to build motorcycles,

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.407
and be a stunt man in my spare time, yo!

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.608
Oh, God, I didn't want this.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.524
Rell, Rell.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.286
Come on, bro.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.686
Fucking do it.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.487
Can't do it!

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.966
And you have many more guns than I do.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.884
So, I give you this one.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.530
Y'all ain't from fuckin' Allentown.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.841
Fuckin' knew it.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.411
In a sense,

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.767
aren't we all from Allentown?

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.447
George Michael is
a real nigga, though, right?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.642
He's not black. I lied about that.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.120
He is not black, and I apologize.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.161
Nah!

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.163
And he probably
had a fuckin' father figure

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.731
the whole fuckin' time.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.730
I can't speak to that.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.056
I don't know the man personally.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.605
Bitch, shut the fuck up!

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.886
You don't get to talk!

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.324
Y'all talk too damn much.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.490
- I don't talk that much.
- What?

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.446
Take this nigga out.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.931
No! Please!

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.960
Not in front of us.
Please, not in front of us.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.647
Oh.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.531
Just taking me out from the trunk?
Oh, thank you.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.520
And put him in our trunk.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.011
Aw, man.

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.207
Okay. Okay.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.136
Well, anything better
than being shot, you heard?

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.845
Right? Oh, I stand corrected! No, no, no!

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.005
No, no, no!

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.246
No, no, no!

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.164
Oh, this is fucking gross!

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.924
Oh, this is fuckin'...

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.687
Motherfucker!

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.968
- So, my name is Rell.
- And I am Clarence.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.246
Look.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.209
You two morons is coming with us.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.682
Allentown or not, y'all gonna
be my Allentown niggas today.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.246
You do anything stupid,
and you're fuckin' dead.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.641
- Okay.
- Yep.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.360
That goes without saying at this point.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.050
That gun is so close to my head.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.725
Is that necessary?

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.606
Welcome to my home, guys. How you doing?

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.048
Anything? Beer, wine, liquor, girls?

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.247
Videogames?

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.327
No?

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.524
Bacon Diaz.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.250
I heard you had a baller crib,

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.643
but this is practically
Neverland fuckin' Ranch out here.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.481
Thank you. Thanks.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.722
Who the fuck is...

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.086
That's them.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.321
That's them?

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.323
The Allentown niggas.

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.410
Los Phantomas?

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.440
Yep. They the ones
that killed your cousin.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.482
And we here to collect the bounty.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.687
Wait...

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.081
No fuckin' way these guys
could be the Phantomas, man.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.605
They're like shadows, man.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.967
They're like the boogeyman
and shit, you know?

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.451
- No, you're right.
- Good eye.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.728
But what happened was
I was trying to get my cat.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.763
- That's his cat.
- And his name is Keanu.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.960
It's this cat right there!

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.764
Iglesias?

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.288
That's my cousin's cat.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.041
They took him?

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.486
Who? Who?

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.216
Oh, shit.
Somebody's getting an ass whippin'.

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.242
- Let's go. Come on!
- Yeah!

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.126
God damn right, they had him.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.645
- We did not have him.
- No.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.484
No, no, no. There's no way, sir.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.240
That cat just was found on his doorstep.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.481
That cat's name is Keanu.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.416
- I know because I named him.
- And has been his for months.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.760
It's too much of a coincidence...

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.600
So, it was them?

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.171
Shit, yeah, it was them.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.845
No! No, it was not us.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.570
Do we got a deal or what?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.001
Deal.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.161
Deal. Why is it a deal?

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.280
Don't make the deal,
because we're not those guys.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.526
Show them.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.165
Give me a second before I kill you.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.687
Oh, God!

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.046
Come on, man!

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.561
Why is everybody being hasty?

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.131
Get Iglesias.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.689
Whoa. Wait a minute.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.808
I was thinking I would hold on to the cat.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.723
Okay. See, there's a problem with that,

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.009
because Iglesias belongs to my family.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.529
I wanna give him to my aunt, so she can
have something to remember my cousin by.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.681
You know?

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.922
So, that's non-negotiable.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.204
Deal breaker.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.920
Deal breaker.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.366
Don't think too long, kid.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.249
Don't think too long.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.369
Aight, Papi.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.445
Look here, man.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.645
Oh, God.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.126
Bottom line is...

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.361
Light this bitch up!

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.451
Stitches!

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.411
You need help?

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.130
Nah!

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.244
Rell, Rell! Look, look!

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.811
They're communicating.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.680
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.370
I got you!

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:52.967
Awesome!

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.929
I know. Yeah. Oh.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.726
Hi-C!

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.884
Get the damn cat!

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.809
- Get the damn cat!
- Fuck!

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.601
No, Rell! Whoa!

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.762
Hey! You will die!

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.604
Then get my back.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.525
Don't tell me you just tried to flip,

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.250
'cause you flopped, stupid!

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.526
Give me the cat.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.205
- Give me the cat.
- No! Keanu!

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.361
Come on, Iglesias.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.567
Who's going home?

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.643
Going home, home...

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.645
Rell... No! Why!

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.411
He's got Keanu!

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.166
Where'd he go?

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.401
Let's go.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.088
I got you, Iglesias. Here we go. Okay.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.600
Manny, open the car. Open the car.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.087
I got Iglesias.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.721
Go, go, go.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.006
Where are you going?

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.889
- Your house!
- My house?

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.051
What are you doing?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.081
What? Rell!

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.561
Rell, you can't drive!

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.844
Unbelievable. What...

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.091
- I'll shoot you!
- Oh, fuck!

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.242
You ain't gonna fuckin' shoot the driver!

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.686
What are you doing?

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.887
Oh, shit!

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.610
Yeah, motherfucker!

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.921
Oh, fuck! Look out!

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.844
I don't even know how to fuckin' drive!

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.604
I'm coming, Rell!

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.206
Oh, fuck!

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.209
Why did I grab a stick shift?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.766
Whoa...

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.286
Oh, shit!

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:48.967
Fuck, yeah!

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.121
Oh, shit!

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.761
Oh...

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.485
Sorry! I'm sorry.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.321
Oh, my God!

01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.841
Okay, here he is.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.684
You're not getting away from me!

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.808
Red light! Coming through the red light!

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.281
Yo!

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.081
Whoo!

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.004
Oh, my God, Rell! What are you doing?

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.366
Right now. Turn around.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.966
Shit!

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.488
Fuck!

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.166
You okay, Keanu?

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.767
Why are we going through red lights?
I'm sorry! Sorry!

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.163
I can't fuckin' hear
what you're saying, bro!

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.644
Listen to me!

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.965
Oh, shit!

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.921
Oh!

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.164
That fuckin' hurts!

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.321
Okay, okay.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.161
Keanu!

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.170
Come here.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.885
Come here, Keanu.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.849
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.525
- You come here!
- Fuck!

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.489
I'ma punch you in the head.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.441
Ah...

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.921
Oh...

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.162
- Yes! Yes!
- Get him off me!

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.322
Get that bitch, Keanu!

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.041
Oh, shit!

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.807
Oh!

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.881
Oh...

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.251
Fuck.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.766
Fuck.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.761
Oh...

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.370
Keanu!

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.245
Oh, man.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.446
Of course you're alive.

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.281
What?

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.807
You got a-fuckin'-nother gun in your ass?

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.246
What?

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:30.927
Shit!

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:34.886
Who the fuck taught you how to drive,
you bad-driving bitch?

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.924
I don't drive.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.131
He does.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.761
- Oh...
- Whoo!

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.165
- That's my cousin!
- I got him!

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.641
Clarence, you did it, man!
Fuck, you did it, cuz!

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.290
That was so fuckin' badass!

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.641
Oh, thanks, man.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.121
- I can't find Keanu!
- Keanu! Shit!

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.647
God, ow.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.643
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.167
Trying to kill me with my kid's car!

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.251
No.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.922
I'm unkillable.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.240
What the fuck?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.368
Blips was supposed to run this game, man.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.045
We supposed to own this city.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.851
And y'all fuckin' ruined it.
Y'all fucked everything up.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.646
I lost my money.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.689
I lost my cat.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.805
I still gotta get mines, though.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.166
The only way I know how.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.685
Cheddar!

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.281
You're under arrest.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.169
What?

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.410
Bitch, you ain't no fuckin' cop.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.846
Oh, yes, I am a fuckin' cop.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.729
Put your weapon down.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.166
Now drop your weapons!

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.846
Trunk, drop it.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.366
On the ground?

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.522
Yes, motherfucker, on the ground.

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.041
Stitches,

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.526
drop it.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.886
Yeah.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.407
Bud.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.889
Not you, C.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.889
You gonna kill me?

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.886
All this Bliptown family shit?

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.371
It's over.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.525
Cheddar, you're under arrest.

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.364
Put your hands up.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.563
I will shoot you.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.008
Don't turn your back on me.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.086
Fuck you, bitch!

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.766
Get your hands up!

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.763
- I'm a cop!
- Hands up!

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.410
- I'm a cop!
- Get on the ground!

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.216
Get on your knees. Hands behind your head.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.242
- Let me see 'em!
- Now!

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.965
On your knees!

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.485
Now! On your knees!

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.285
Keanu!

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.931
Go get him, Rell.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.009
It's me. You all right?

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.049
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.560
I love you.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.570
We're gonna go home.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.681
All right. We're good. We're gonna go.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.401
What?

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.600
- Wait, no. Stay in the car!
- Why? What's going on?

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:53.000
Because there's a bunch
of dead people out here, that's why.

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.130
- Honey! You punched him in the face!
- Yeah.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.400
You punched him in the face.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.124
I need you to fuck me right now.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.850
Okay. Stay in the car!

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.008
Right now. Stay in the car.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.241
Oh, yes!

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.844
Well, this was a fuckin' mess.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.161
Tell me about it.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.845
Hey, I know you need this back.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.286
He's keepin' his.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.124
- Rell.
- You're doing good work.

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.521
We need to talk about
a few things before you go.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.851
But first let me introduce you to
Officer Galloway and Officer Dunn.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.445
Oh, snap!

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.644
Right. You're alive.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.689
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.763
I had a fantastic time.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.241
That's weird.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.640
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.840
- What about Anna Faris?
- Well, she's still alive.

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.207
We hire celebrities all the time
to help us with cases.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.169
Like Shaq or Steven Seagal.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.845
No shit.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.726
I'm gonna let you two
talk about that other thing.

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:52.046
Mmm.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.489
"That other thing"?

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.922
Ooh. I like the sound of that.

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.722
So, what, do you need me for some kind of
top-secret mission or something?

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.804
No. No top-secret missions goin' on.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.008
But we need to talk about your behavior.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.724
You know I just wanted my cat back.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.530
I know. And you got him.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.444
Keanu's a cutie.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.725
Damn, Hi-C.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.882
Parker. Trina Parker.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.004
Trina Parker.

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.571
I kind of liked Hi-C.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.722
Well, she kind of liked you, too.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.963
Well... Ow.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.445
Maybe we should go somewhere.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.569
Maybe we should.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.410
Right to jail.

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.450
Whoa...

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.321
Mmm-hmm.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.130
That makes sense.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.362
Broke a lot of laws, probably.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.927
Don't worry. I'll testify on your behalf.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.128
- Watch him for me?
- I will.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.281
And just remember, Rell.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.090
There's consequences to your actions.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.281
Hey.

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.204
There's consequences to your actions

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.125
because you gonna be
in trouble in a second.

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.441
- Oh, yeah?
- Hold up. Yeah.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.284
I'm gonna take you on a date.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.249
- Okay.
- Ow. I'm shot in the leg. Ow!

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.970
Ow, ow, ow!

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.243
You ready to go, Keanu?

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.005
You're a cutie.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.811
I can see why he did all of that for you.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.962
Help!

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.167
Help me!

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.801
Help me!

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.246
Oh, thank God.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.124
Yo, kill it! Kill it!

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.926
It hurts so bad, you don't even know.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.328
Hasn't even been that bad, really.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.296
Clarence and I, having killed
the Allentown brothers

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.483
has us kind of lookin' like
crime heroes or somethin'.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.722
We don't even have to
change our voice or anything.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.122
Mostly it's just good to see you.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.840
I love you, Keanu.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.161
How much longer?

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.322
Three more weeks, baby.
That's it. 21 days.

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:07.920
And what are you gonna do to me?

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.280
I'm gonna take this moustache
and I'm just gonna go like...

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.850
Gonna rub it all over your neck.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.256
- Moustache in here...
- I'm gonna put my 'stache

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.600
right in there. I'm just gonna...

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.405
Hey! Quit poundin' on the glass.

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.369
I'm sorry, sir. I apologize.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.807
That's my wife, though.
That was a love pound.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.209
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.800
Thanks for watching him.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.041
No problem.

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.163
He's like one of the family.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.166
I do have some news for you, though.

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.606
What?

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.808
I took Keanu to the vet.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.530
He has a rare disease.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.400
Oh, no.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:49.041
He's gonna be a kitten forever.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.362
What's going on, motherfuckers?

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.124
Okay. Let's do this.
Let's hold this shit down, guys.

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.362
I'm not fuckin' around.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.000
You say somethin'?
