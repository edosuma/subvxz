00:01.258 --> 00:02.691
Eugene: I DIDN'T SAY
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

00:02.758 --> 00:04.125
IT'S JUST SHORT.

00:04.191 --> 00:05.091
IT'S BEAUTIFUL SHORT.

00:05.158 --> 00:06.558
I AGREE.

00:06.625 --> 00:08.191
AND I BET
IT'S MORE MANAGEABLE,

00:08.258 --> 00:11.191
LIKE WHEN YOU USE BRECK
OR SOMETHING.

00:11.258 --> 00:12.458
THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE A TOUGH TIME

00:12.525 --> 00:13.858
PROVING YOU WERE
AFTER TOURISTS.

00:13.925 --> 00:15.391
MY CONCERN IS
IT WON'T MATTER.

00:15.458 --> 00:17.491
I JUST WANTED THE MONEY.

00:17.558 --> 00:18.525
LIKE THAT DO.

00:18.591 --> 00:21.558
HEY, WARREN, WARREN,
A JURY IS A JURY.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.525
YOU SNATCHED
A HANDBAG OUT
OF AN OLD LADY'S HAND,

00:23.591 --> 00:25.958
AND THEY'RE GONNA WANT
TO PUT YOU IN JAIL--
HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:26.025 --> 00:27.691
YOU GOT TO
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

00:27.758 --> 00:28.791
OK.

00:28.858 --> 00:30.691
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, WEAR A TIE.

00:30.758 --> 00:31.525
DONNELL AND ASSOCIATES.

00:31.591 --> 00:32.558
Heric: GET ME
BOBBY DONNELL.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.225
MR. DONNELL ISN'T
AVAILABLE. CAN I--OK.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.625
TELL YOUR POSSE
TO GET DOWN HERE
RIGHT AWAY.

00:37.691 --> 00:38.525
YES.

00:38.591 --> 00:39.558
TELL THEM
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

00:39.625 --> 00:40.758
I'LL TELL THEM.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:40.825 --> 00:41.891
E-M-E-R-

00:41.958 --> 00:45.291
YES, JOEY, I GOT THAT.
I'LL TELL THEM.
G-E-N-C-Y.

00:45.358 --> 00:48.358
JOEY HERIC. HE SAYS HE NEEDS
YOU TO COME TO HIS PLACE.

00:48.425 --> 00:50.358
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NOT ME.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.791
HE SAYS IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

00:51.858 --> 00:53.625
YEAH? EMERGENCY?
WHAT DID HE DO,
KILL MARTY NOW?

00:53.691 --> 00:54.691
TELL BOBBY.

00:54.758 --> 00:55.891
I WILL, BUT YOU BETTER
GET OVER THERE.

00:55.958 --> 00:57.225
FORGET ABOUT IT.
I'M NOT GOIN'.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.625
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT I AM GOING.

00:59.691 --> 01:01.225
I AM NOT GOING ALONE.

01:04.625 --> 01:07.258
MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
WAS TO NEVER LAY EYES
ON HIM AGAIN.

01:07.325 --> 01:08.791
JUST DON'T
LET HIM BAIT YOU.

01:08.858 --> 01:12.991
YEAH. YOU WATCH.
HE'S KILLED SOMEBODY.
I PROMISE YOU.

01:13.058 --> 01:14.591
[KNOCKING]

01:14.658 --> 01:15.891
[FOOTSTEPS]

01:17.291 --> 01:21.291
ALL I WANT TO SAY
IS PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.158
Ellenor: ALL RIGHT,
WHERE'S MARTY?

01:27.225 --> 01:28.291
TELL ME YOU
DIDN'T KILL MARTY.

01:28.358 --> 01:29.558
THERE YOU GO JUDGING ME.

01:29.625 --> 01:32.558
CAN YOU KEEP YOUR MIND
AJAR, IF NOT OPEN,
YOU HIPPO?

01:32.625 --> 01:34.891
LISTEN, YOU PSYCHO,
WHY'D YOU CALL US
DOWN HERE?

01:34.958 --> 01:35.891
IT'S MARTY.

01:35.958 --> 01:38.291
HE'S NOT HIMSELF.

01:40.891 --> 01:42.158
THERE.

01:42.225 --> 01:44.291
HE LOOKS PALE.

01:46.625 --> 01:49.591
AGAIN, I ASK YOU
NOT TO JUDGE ME.

02:37.991 --> 02:38.791
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

02:38.857 --> 02:40.024
2 LOVERS,
AND THEY'RE BOTH DEAD?

02:40.091 --> 02:41.857
LUCKY I'M NOT A FLIRT.

02:41.924 --> 02:43.691
QUIET! NOW, WHAT
THE HELL HAPPENED,
YOU KILLED HIM?

02:43.757 --> 02:45.057
DON'T YOU FIRST WANT TO
GIVE ME THE BIG ADVISORY,

02:45.124 --> 02:47.224
"BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY,
WE'LL BE STUCK WITH IT"?

02:47.291 --> 02:50.857
NO. THIS TIME YOU
TELL ME THE DAMN TRUTH!

02:50.924 --> 02:52.324
I KILLED HIM.

02:52.391 --> 02:53.757
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

02:53.824 --> 02:56.657
I WAS TRYING TO
WIN AN ARGUMENT.

02:56.724 --> 02:57.891
YOU KNOW, THE LAST WORD
CAN BE SO HARD!

02:57.957 --> 03:00.091
YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE
YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT
LAST TIME

03:00.157 --> 03:01.624
YOU CAN GET AWAY
WITH IT WHENEVER?

03:03.057 --> 03:04.057
YES.

03:04.124 --> 03:05.424
YOU'RE SICK, JOEY.

03:05.491 --> 03:08.124
ASIDE FROM THAT,
LET'S FOCUS.

03:08.191 --> 03:10.791
NOW, LAST TIME,
I HAD A RED HERRING
TO WORK WITH.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.824
THIS TIME I DON'T.
I'M THE ONLY SUSPECT,

03:12.891 --> 03:14.624
AND CONSIDERING HOW LAZY
THE DAMN POLICE ARE,

03:14.691 --> 03:16.591
THEY'LL JUST SETTLE
ON ME, WON'T THEY?
THEY WON'T GO SEARCH.

03:16.657 --> 03:19.224
THEY'LL SAY,
"HE KILLED BEFORE,
HE DID IT AGAIN HERE."

03:19.291 --> 03:20.591
AND THEY'D BE RIGHT.

03:20.657 --> 03:22.691
MARTY IS KNOWN
FOR A TEMPER.

03:22.757 --> 03:25.157
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
WE KNOW HE DID THREATEN
TO KILL PETER,

03:25.224 --> 03:26.457
AND I CAUGHT A BREAK HERE:

03:26.524 --> 03:28.524
HE WAS HOLDING THAT KNIFE
IN HIS HAND

03:28.591 --> 03:30.491
BEFORE IT REACHED
ITS FINAL DESTINATION,

03:30.557 --> 03:32.024
SO SELF-DEFENSE IS VIABLE.

03:32.091 --> 03:34.057
ALSO, WE CAN'T
RULE OUT INSANITY.

03:34.124 --> 03:35.524
I MEAN--HEH HEH--

03:35.591 --> 03:37.724
GOODNESS, I GO AROUND
KILLING PEOPLE.

03:40.424 --> 03:42.791
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS GUY?
IS HE SICK?

03:42.857 --> 03:43.857
OBVIOUSLY.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.524
ANYWAY, ELLENOR'S
STARTING TRIAL
TOMORROW--

03:46.591 --> 03:48.857
I'M IN. JUST TELL ME
WHERE TO START.

03:48.924 --> 03:51.324
ARRAIGNMENT'S AT 10.
I'M NOT EXPECTING
TO GET BAIL.

03:51.391 --> 03:52.591
DID HE
GIVE ANY STATEMENTS--

03:52.657 --> 03:53.791
NO, AND HE'S
NOT GOING TO.

03:53.857 --> 03:55.691
I'M GONNA MOVE FOR
A FAST PROBABLE CAUSE.

03:55.757 --> 03:58.524
NOW, I NEED
SOME RESEARCH
ON PRIOR BAD ACTS.

03:58.591 --> 04:00.424
WE NEED TO
SUPPRESS THE FACT
THAT HE'S KILLED BEFORE.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.291
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE WORST PART
ABOUT THIS IS?

04:02.357 --> 04:04.691
WE COULD ACTUALLY
GET HIM OFF AGAIN.

04:04.757 --> 04:07.257
WE DON'T HAVE TO
REPRESENT THE GUY.

04:07.324 --> 04:09.757
I MEAN, WHY DO IT IF--

04:09.824 --> 04:11.657
BECAUSE...WE CARE.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.257
MY OTHER LAWYER
SAID COME TO YOU.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.791
HE SAID YOU'D
BEATEN THEM BEFORE.

04:19.857 --> 04:21.624
WE SETTLED.
NOBODY REALLY BEATS
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.391
IT'S UP AGAINST
THE SAME LAWYER,

04:23.457 --> 04:25.191
THE SAME FIRM
YOU BEAT, SO--

04:25.257 --> 04:26.791
MRS. CARROLL,
EVEN IF WE
CAN PROVE

04:26.857 --> 04:28.224
YOUR SON
IS ADDICTED
TO CIGARETTES--

04:28.291 --> 04:29.524
WHICH I DON'T THINK I AM.

04:29.591 --> 04:31.491
YOU'VE
TRIED THE PATCH,
THE GUM.

04:31.557 --> 04:32.691
YOU CAN'T QUIT,
JEFFREY.

04:32.757 --> 04:34.024
MY POINT IS,
EVEN IF WE COULD
PROVE ADDICTION,

04:34.091 --> 04:37.357
WE CAN'T REALLY
ESTABLISH DAMAGES.
HE'S NOT SICK YET.

04:37.424 --> 04:39.924
BUT HE WILL BE
IF HE KEEPS SMOKING.

04:39.991 --> 04:42.124
THERE ARE PLENTY OF
CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS
YOU COULD JOIN INTO,

04:42.191 --> 04:43.424
LAW FIRMS
WHO SPECIALIZE--

04:43.491 --> 04:45.957
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT TAKES FOREVER.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.491
MISS DOLE, I KNOW THIS
ISN'T MUCH OF A CASE,

04:48.557 --> 04:51.091
AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR SOME OF THIS.

04:51.157 --> 04:55.357
A GOOD PARENT SHOULD
BE ABLE TO STEER HIS SON
AWAY FROM CIGARETTES,

04:55.424 --> 04:57.524
BUT THEY HAVE TO TAKE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY, TOO.

04:57.591 --> 05:00.224
THEY ADVERTISE TO
MAKE SMOKING SEEM COOL.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.924
IT JUST ISN'T RIGHT,

05:01.991 --> 05:06.057
AND I JUST CAN'T
SIT BACK AND IGNORE IT.

05:06.124 --> 05:07.357
EVEN SO--

05:07.424 --> 05:09.257
COULD YOU JUST LOOK
AT THE FILE?

05:09.324 --> 05:10.757
I BROUGHT IT.

05:14.191 --> 05:15.257
SURE.

05:15.324 --> 05:16.257
OHH!

05:16.324 --> 05:17.657
[SLAMS DRAWER]

05:19.191 --> 05:21.257
ALL 3 VICTIMS WERE
FROM OUT OF STATE.

05:21.324 --> 05:23.657
DID THE DEFENDANT
HAVE REASON TO KNOW
THEY WERE TOURISTS?

05:23.724 --> 05:24.724
OBJECTION!

05:24.791 --> 05:26.191
OVERRULED.

05:26.257 --> 05:27.657
YOUR HONOR, THIS WITNESS
HAS NO FOUNDATION

05:27.724 --> 05:29.457
AS TO THE DEFENDANT'S
STATE OF MIND,

05:29.524 --> 05:32.024
PLUS THE QUESTION
ASSUMES FACTS
NOT IN EVIDENCE.

05:32.091 --> 05:33.191
OVERRULED.

05:33.257 --> 05:34.691
BEING FROM OUT OF STATE

05:34.757 --> 05:36.257
DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY
MAKE SOMEBODY A TOURIST.

05:36.324 --> 05:38.624
MISS FRUTT, I'VE
OVERRULED YOU 3 TIMES.

05:38.691 --> 05:41.724
DO YOU WANT THE BAILIFF
TO GET INVOLVED?

05:41.791 --> 05:44.991
PLANT YOURSELF
BACK IN THAT CHAIR.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.291
OFFICER, DID THE DEFENDANT
EVER ROB A PERSON

05:52.357 --> 05:54.457
THAT WAS NOT
FROM OUT OF STATE?

05:54.524 --> 05:58.024
LAST YEAR,
HE ACCOSTED A WOMAN
NAMED MARIE TEACHER.

05:58.091 --> 06:01.124
IN THAT CASE,
UPON DISCOVERING SHE
WAS A BOSTON WOMAN--

06:01.191 --> 06:03.591
OBJECTION. THIS GOES
TO MY CLIENT'S STATE
OF MIND AGAIN.

06:03.657 --> 06:05.624
THE OBJECTION
IS OVERRULED.

06:05.691 --> 06:07.824

SPEAK TO INTENT?
HE WASN'T EVEN THERE.

06:08.757 --> 06:09.724
PLUS WHICH INTENT
TO EFFECT COMMERCE

06:39.991 --> 06:41.991
MY CLIENT HAS NO RECORD
OF KILLING ANYONE.

06:42.057 --> 06:45.191
HE HAS ONLY ONE CHARGE,
WHICH GOES TO AIDING
AND ABETTING.

06:45.257 --> 06:46.324
I'M DENYING BAIL.

06:46.391 --> 06:49.024

NIGHT I'D GET THIS GUY BACK.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.391
WE'RE OPEN TO A PLEA:

07:06.457 --> 07:07.591

07:07.657 --> 07:09.157
YOU KNOW,
IF I LOSE THIS CASE,

07:09.224 --> 07:12.757
I AM GOING TO RUN
THROUGH THIS BUILDING
ABSOLUTELY NAKED.

07:15.991 --> 07:18.491
Bobby: IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT YOU SAY NOTHING.

07:18.557 --> 07:20.957
THE QUESTION IS,
IS IT POSSIBLE?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.824
CAN YOU GO A DAY
WITHOUT OPENING
YOUR MOUTH?

07:22.891 --> 07:25.391
LET ME SEE.

07:26.257 --> 07:27.257
NO.

07:27.324 --> 07:28.724
YOU THINK I'M KIDDING?

07:28.791 --> 07:31.124
THEY MAY
PLANT AN INFORMANT
IN YOUR CELL.

07:31.191 --> 07:33.124
THEY'RE NOT ADVERSE
TO PULLING STUNTS.

07:33.191 --> 07:34.357
THEY'LL GET YOU
ANY WAY THEY CAN,

07:34.424 --> 07:36.291
EVEN NOW,
THEY COULD BE LISTENING.

07:36.357 --> 07:37.591
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

07:37.657 --> 07:39.324
I THINK THEY MOVED
TOO FAST ON THE ARREST.

07:39.391 --> 07:41.157
THEY GOT OVERANXIOUS.

07:41.224 --> 07:42.757
PROBABLE CAUSE
IS TOMORROW.

07:42.824 --> 07:44.624
WE'LL KNOW THEN.

07:44.691 --> 07:47.891
UNTIL TOMORROW,
<i>YOU</i> HAVE TO KEEP
YOUR MOUTH <i>SHUT.</i>

07:52.557 --> 07:55.457

CANNOTTAKE THIS CASE!

07:55.524 --> 07:57.324
I'LL JUST TRY ONE SHOT--

07:57.391 --> 07:58.891

WITH THE PROFESSOR.

07:58.957 --> 07:59.957

08:00.024 --> 08:00.924
IT CAN'T HURT, REBECCA.

08:00.991 --> 08:02.024
CAN'T HURT?

08:02.091 --> 08:03.757
LAST TIME,
WE ALMOST WENT BANKRUPT.
WE BAILED OUT--

08:03.824 --> 08:05.891
AND WE ENDED UP
MAKING MONEY!

08:05.957 --> 08:07.991
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CIGARETTE COMPANIES
DO TARGET TEENAGERS.

08:08.057 --> 08:09.124
IF THAT
KID'S ADDICTED,

08:09.191 --> 08:10.724
WHY SHOULDN'T THEY
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE?

08:10.791 --> 08:12.691
AND OFF WE GO.

08:12.757 --> 08:14.024
ONE MEETING.

08:14.091 --> 08:16.357
IT'S WORTH A TRY.

08:17.624 --> 08:20.291
AND YOUR STUDIES
SHOW THAT CRIME
AFFECTS TOURISM?

08:20.357 --> 08:21.691
VERY MUCH SO.

08:21.757 --> 08:23.224
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO
VACATION IN PLACES

08:23.291 --> 08:24.457
WHERE THEY
DON'T FEEL SAFE.

08:24.524 --> 08:26.924
AFTER RENTAL CARS
WERE TARGETED
IN FLORIDA,

08:26.991 --> 08:29.491

STAYED AWAY
IN DROVES.

08:29.557 --> 08:32.091
IN COST THE STATE
MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

08:32.157 --> 08:36.624
DO YOU HAVE ANY DIRECT
EVIDENCE THAT MY CLIENT
HAS AFFECTED COMMERCE?

08:36.691 --> 08:38.424
NOT EVIDENCE DIRECTLY
TO YOUR CLIENT,

08:38.491 --> 08:39.390
BUT CRIME IN GENERAL,
YES--

08:39.457 --> 08:40.691
CRIME IN GENERAL.

08:40.756 --> 08:42.957
AND DO YOU
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
THAT PURSE-SNATCHING

08:43.024 --> 08:44.357
HAS AFFECTED
TOURISM HERE?

08:44.424 --> 08:45.791
I CAN'T CITE STATISTICS.

08:45.857 --> 08:47.791
CITE ANYTHING.
Melnick: OBJECTION.

08:47.857 --> 08:48.691
SUSTAINED.

08:48.757 --> 08:51.457
BUT ISN'T IT
THE PUBLICITY OF CRIME

08:51.524 --> 08:52.924
THAT REALLY HAS THE MOST
DIRECT INFLUENCE?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.624
YES.

08:54.691 --> 08:56.824
AND DOES PURSE-SNATCHING
GET A LOT OF PLAY IN
THE MEDIA HERE?

08:56.891 --> 08:58.324
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

08:58.391 --> 09:01.691
AND TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE,
HAS ANY CRIME EVER
COMMITTED BY MY CLIENT

09:01.757 --> 09:03.157
BEEN REPORTED
TO THE PRESS?

09:03.224 --> 09:05.357
OBJECTION, RELEVANCE.
SUSTAINED.

09:05.424 --> 09:07.957
YOUR HONOR, THE CHARGE
HERE IS THAT MY CLIENT
HAS AFFECTED COMMERCE.

09:08.024 --> 09:10.257
THIS WITNESS IS THE ONE
SAYING THAT HE HAS.

09:10.324 --> 09:12.157
THE WITNESS IS NOT
TESTIFYING TO THE MEDIA.

09:12.224 --> 09:14.557
THE OBJECTION
IS SUSTAINED.

09:18.357 --> 09:23.457
MR. SAMUELSON, HAS
THE PROSECUTION PAID YOU
FOR TODAY'S TESTIMONY?

09:23.524 --> 09:25.791
I'VE RECEIVED A SMALL
STIPEND FOR MY EXPENSES.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.991
AND WOULD THAT
BE MORE OR LESS THAN
THEY'VE PAID THE JUDGE?

09:52.073 --> 09:54.173
KEPT ME IN THERE
6 HOURS!

09:54.240 --> 09:55.273
WHAT IS THE DEAL?

09:55.340 --> 09:57.240
THE JUDGE PLANS
TO RUN FOR CONGRESS,
I DON'T KNOW.

09:57.307 --> 09:59.373
HE HAS A THING
ABOUT REPEAT OFFENDERS.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.873
THEY OFFERING ANY PLEA?

10:00.940 --> 10:02.907
NOT YET. THEY'RE GONNA
FINISH UP THIS MORNING,

10:02.973 --> 10:05.540
I WILL BE MOVING
FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT.
HOW'S PSYCHO?

10:05.607 --> 10:07.573
OH, DON'T ASK.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.407
HEY, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

10:09.473 --> 10:10.573
MEETING.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.407
SHE TOOK
A TOBACCO CASE.

10:12.473 --> 10:13.607
WHAT?

10:13.673 --> 10:16.173
I AGREED TO A MEETING.
REBECCA.

10:20.173 --> 10:21.307
YOU WANT ME?

10:21.373 --> 10:22.573
SCOTT SAID PICK A BODY.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.407
YOU'RE NOT STILL SEEING
DONALD, ARE YOU?

10:24.473 --> 10:25.507
NO.

10:25.573 --> 10:28.640
WOULD YOU
HAVE ANY TROUBLE
GOING UP AGAINST HIM?

10:28.707 --> 10:29.873
NO.

10:29.940 --> 10:31.873
I CAN'T LET THIS
HERIC GUY WALK TWICE.

10:31.940 --> 10:34.773
HE COMPLETELY
SUCKERED ME LAST TIME.

10:36.607 --> 10:37.973
WHAT TIME'S THE P.C.?

10:38.040 --> 10:39.807
10:00.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.240
SO WHAT DO YOU
SAY? TEAM?

10:44.573 --> 10:46.440
TEAM.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.307
LINDSAY, I CAN'T JUST
CUT A CHECK TO SOMEONE

10:57.373 --> 11:00.707
BECAUSE HER LAWYER
HAPPENS TO BE A FORMER
STUDENT OF MINE.

11:00.773 --> 11:01.973
YOU COULD GET OUT
WITH NUISANCE.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.040
THE BOY ISN'T EVEN SICK.
HE COULD BE.

11:04.107 --> 11:04.940
HE COULD BE.

11:05.007 --> 11:06.140
YOU DON'T WANT THIS CASE
TO COME TO TRIAL.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.573
IT'LL BRING ATTENTION
TO THE FACT

11:07.640 --> 11:09.740
THAT TOBACCO COMPANIES
SPECIFICALLY TARGET
TEENAGERS.

11:09.807 --> 11:13.473
LINDSAY, I'M NOT EVEN
AWARE OF THIS CASE.

11:13.540 --> 11:17.507
YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T
EXPECT ME TO MAKE
AN OFFER ON IT.

11:17.573 --> 11:19.740
HOWEVER...

11:19.807 --> 11:23.940
I CAN MAKE
AN OFFER TO YOU.

11:24.007 --> 11:25.840
SORRY?

11:25.907 --> 11:28.240
COME WORK HERE.

11:28.307 --> 11:30.040
PROFESSOR--

11:30.107 --> 11:32.540
DON'T TELL ME
THE HEADHUNTERS
AREN'T CALLING.

11:32.607 --> 11:34.573
YOUR REPUTATION IS...

11:34.640 --> 11:37.073
WELL, LET ME
PUT IT THIS WAY.

11:37.140 --> 11:39.973
IT COULDN'T BE MORE
OPPOSITE TO THE ONE
ENJOYED BY YOUR FIRM.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.907
MY FIRM HAS A PRETTY
GOOD TRACK RECORD,
PROFESSOR.

11:41.973 --> 11:45.207
TRACK RECORD GOES
WITH WINS AND LOSSES.

11:45.273 --> 11:47.740
LINDSAY,

11:47.807 --> 11:51.573
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU ARE GOING TO WAKE UP
AND ASK YOURSELF

11:51.640 --> 11:53.873
"WHAT HAVE
I BEEN DOING?"

11:53.940 --> 11:57.040
CRIMINAL LAW
MIGHT BE EXCITING,

11:57.107 --> 12:00.373
THE KIND OF SHORTCUT
LITIGATION YOU PRACTICE
MIGHT EVEN BE FUN.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.607
BUT AT THE END
OF THE DAY, WHEN IT'S
ALL OVER AND DONE,

12:03.673 --> 12:07.340
YOU GO HOME WITH
YOUR OWN LEGACY.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.940
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE PROUD OF YOURS

12:11.007 --> 12:12.940
IF YOU STAY
IN THAT FIRM,

12:13.007 --> 12:15.773
AND I DON'T THINK
I REALLY HAVE TO
TELL YOU THAT.

12:17.673 --> 12:20.907
I CAME IN HERE
TO TALK ABOUT A CASE.

12:22.673 --> 12:24.773
ON THAT, YOU'LL
CERTAINLY GET NOTHING.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.807
WHEN I ARRIVED,
HE WAS THERE, 3 LAWYERS,
AND A VICTIM.

12:30.873 --> 12:32.373
DID HE TELL YOU ANYTHING?

12:32.440 --> 12:33.573
NO, HE DID NOT.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.140
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

12:35.207 --> 12:38.307
WE PLACED THE DEFENDANT
UNDER ARREST.

12:38.373 --> 12:41.807
Bobby: YOU MADE
AN IMMEDIATE ARREST,
DETECTIVE.

12:41.873 --> 12:43.807
YOU DIDN'T
WAIT TO INVESTIGATE.

12:43.873 --> 12:45.273
YOU READ THIS
MAN HIS RIGHTS,

12:45.340 --> 12:47.073
YOU SLAPPED THE CUFFS
ON HIM, AND HERE WE ARE.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.740
WHAT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
DO YOU HAVE?

12:49.807 --> 12:52.107
WE HAVE HIS FINGERPRINTS
ON THE MURDER WEAPON.

12:52.173 --> 12:55.673
WELL, THE MURDER WEAPON
WAS A KITCHEN KNIFE
IN HIS OWN KITCHEN.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.173
IT WOULD SEEM.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.140
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE?
NOTHING ELSE AT ALL?

12:59.207 --> 13:02.240
WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE
THE MAN KILLED HIS
LAST LOVER WITH A KNIFE.

13:02.307 --> 13:04.340
AND THAT FIGURED
INTO YOUR THINKING HERE?

13:04.407 --> 13:06.240
OF COURSE IT DID.

13:06.307 --> 13:09.140
HE PLUNGED A KNIFE INTO
THE CHEST OF A LOVER,
KILLING HIM.

13:09.207 --> 13:11.573
WE FIND HIM IN A ROOM
WITH ANOTHER DEAD LOVER,

13:11.640 --> 13:13.640
A KNIFE STUCK
IN HIS CHEST.

13:13.707 --> 13:17.207
DESPITE WHAT YOU HEARD,
WE'RE NOT DOPES.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.073
WE'RE THE DOPES.

13:19.140 --> 13:20.807
WHAT HAPPENED IN
THERE WAS GOOD,
JOEY.

13:20.873 --> 13:22.307
WHAT GOOD? WE LOST.

13:22.373 --> 13:24.507
WHAT WAS THE GOAL,
TO BUILD CHARACTER?

13:24.573 --> 13:26.173
WE KNEW HE'D FIND
PROBABLE CAUSE,

13:26.240 --> 13:28.773
BUT WE SET UP OUR MOTION
TO SUPPRESS PERFECTLY.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.740
SUPPRESS? WHAT ARE WE
TRYING TO SUPPRESS

13:30.807 --> 13:32.507
OTHER THAN THE ILLUSION
OF INTELLIGENCE?

13:32.573 --> 13:35.440
WE'RE TRYING TO
KEEP OUT OF EVIDENCE
THE FACT YOU KILLED BEFORE.

13:35.507 --> 13:36.607
IF WE DON'T--

13:36.673 --> 13:38.773
CAN YOU?

13:38.840 --> 13:41.773
CAN YOU SUPPRESS IT?

13:43.773 --> 13:45.907
WE'RE GONNA TRY.

13:51.573 --> 13:52.507
HELEN.

13:52.573 --> 13:54.173
BOBBY.

13:55.340 --> 13:59.507
SO, UH, I GUESS IT'S OK
TO BE ON OPPOSITE
SIDES NOW, HUH?

13:59.573 --> 14:02.507
WELL, NO CONFLICT
THIS TIME.

14:02.573 --> 14:04.340
GUESS NOT.

14:07.807 --> 14:10.207
AT THIS POINT,
YOUR HONOR, I WOULD MOVE
FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT.

14:10.273 --> 14:13.207
THE GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED
TO ESTABLISH ANY EFFECT
ON COMMERCE.

14:13.273 --> 14:16.540
THERE IS NO BURDEN ON US
UNDER THE HOBBS ACT TO
PROVE AN ACTUAL EFFECT.

14:16.607 --> 14:17.807
YOU WANT ME
TO READ THE LAW?

14:17.873 --> 14:20.140
STOP WITH THE WORD
GAMES, COUNSEL.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.440
WORD GAMES?

14:21.507 --> 14:22.740
THE LAW IS A WORD GAME?

14:22.807 --> 14:24.340
I AM LOSING PATIENCE.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.007
UNITED STATES VS. BUFFY--

14:28.073 --> 14:30.140
FOURTH CIRCUIT,
NOT FIRST.

14:30.207 --> 14:32.907
"GOVERNMENT
FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE
THE DEFENDANT'S CONDUCT

14:32.973 --> 14:35.640
WAS REASONABLY
LIKELY TO AFFECT
INTERSTATE COMMERCE."

14:35.707 --> 14:37.840
YOUR MOTION
IS DENIED.

14:37.907 --> 14:40.673
I AM LOSING
MY PATIENCE.

14:40.740 --> 14:41.907
THE HELL
WITH PATIENCE.

14:41.973 --> 14:43.073
YOU'VE LOST
YOUR MIND,

14:43.140 --> 14:46.173
AND THAT HASN'T
SLOWED YOU DOWN.

14:49.807 --> 14:52.273
YOU HAVE TO DROP IT.
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

14:52.340 --> 14:53.607
DID I SAY I WOULDN'T?

14:53.673 --> 14:55.573
WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING
THROUGH THE FILE,
WHICH IS PAPER THIN.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.540
I--I'M JUST...
LOOK AT THIS,

14:58.607 --> 15:00.173
MOTION TO PRODUCE.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.873
IN RESPONSE TO
ANY STUDIES INVOLVING
SMOKING AND CANCER,

15:03.940 --> 15:05.707
THEY CLAIM WORK PRODUCT,

15:05.773 --> 15:06.907
MARKET RESEARCH STUDIES,

15:06.973 --> 15:08.140
ATTORNEY-CLIENT
PRIVILEGE.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.273
GIVE ME A BREAK.
THEY'VE PRODUCE NOTHING.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.607
GEE.

15:11.673 --> 15:12.773
[SIGHS]

15:12.840 --> 15:15.173
WELL, AT LEAST I TRIED.

15:19.740 --> 15:20.740
WHAT?

15:20.807 --> 15:22.540
MAYBE THIS IS
WHAT WE GO WITH.

15:22.607 --> 15:23.640
WHAT, NOTHING?

15:23.707 --> 15:25.473
LET'S DRAFT AN EX-PARTE
MOTION TO COMPEL

15:25.540 --> 15:28.607
AND FILE
AN AMENDED COMPLAINT
NAMING FINLEY HOAG.

15:28.673 --> 15:30.307
THE LAW FIRM?

15:30.373 --> 15:31.673
AND PEARSON PERSONALLY.

15:31.740 --> 15:33.007
YOU CAN'T AMEND THIS LATE.

15:33.073 --> 15:34.040
THEY'LL HIT YOU WITH ABUSE
OF PROCESS FOR JUST TRYING.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.073
I JUST WANT TO
GET THEIR ATTENTION,

15:36.140 --> 15:37.707
AND LEAK A COPY
SO THEY'LL BE SURE
TO SHOW UP.

15:37.773 --> 15:39.407
LINDSAY, WHAT
ARE YOU UP TO NOW?

15:39.473 --> 15:41.773
NOTHING.
THAT'S OUR CASE.

15:45.307 --> 15:47.940
IT CAN'T BE ALLOWED INTO
EVIDENCE THAT HE KILLED
HIS FORMER LOVER.

15:48.007 --> 15:49.540
GOES TO SHOW
MODUS OPERANDI.

15:49.607 --> 15:53.140
THE FINAL TEST HAS TO BE
IS IT PREJUDICIAL OR NOT,
AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS.

15:53.207 --> 15:54.840
IF HE GOES TO
CLAIM SELF-DEFENSE--

15:54.907 --> 15:56.240
OR THAT IT WAS
I HAVEN'T FINISHED.
CAN I FINISH?

15:56.307 --> 15:58.107
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE--
OR IS THAT AGAINST
YOUR MODUS OPERANDI?

15:58.173 --> 16:00.573
Judge: QUIET!
QUIET DOWN!

16:00.640 --> 16:02.007
MY CLIENT WOULDN'T
GET A FAIR TRIAL

16:02.073 --> 16:04.007
IF THE JURY LEARNS THAT
HE KILLED HIS LAST LOVER.

16:04.073 --> 16:05.907
THEY'D AUTOMATICALLY THINK
THAT HE KILLED THIS GUY.

16:05.973 --> 16:07.673
LET'S GIVE THE JURY
SOME CREDIT HERE,
SHALL WE?

16:07.740 --> 16:09.107
MORE THAN YOUR DETECTIVE?

16:09.173 --> 16:11.207
JUDGE, DETECTIVE McKREW
SAID HIMSELF

16:11.273 --> 16:14.573
HE MADE THE ARREST
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT
MY CLIENT HAD KILLED BEFORE.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.073
THAT WAS HIS TESTIMONY
AT THE PROBABLE CAUSE
HEARING.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.673
YOUR HONOR,
THE FACT THAT--

16:18.740 --> 16:21.473
WHAT IS YOUR
DEFENSE THEORY?

16:21.540 --> 16:23.107
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED
YET, JUDGE.

16:23.173 --> 16:25.140
ALL RIGHT, IF
THE DEFENSE ARGUES

16:25.207 --> 16:27.073
HE ACCIDENTALLY
STABBED THE VICTIM,

16:27.140 --> 16:29.340
I WILL
ALLOW EVIDENCE OF
THE PRIOR STABBING.

16:29.407 --> 16:32.007
OTHERWISE,
THAT EVIDENCE WILL
BE INADMISSIBLE.

16:32.073 --> 16:33.973
YOUR HONOR,
IT SHOULD BE
ADMISSIBLE.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.040
I HAVE MADE
MY RULING, COUNSEL.

16:36.107 --> 16:38.573
WE CAN SET
PRE-TRIAL SCHEDULES
IN CONFERENCE.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.707
ADJOURNED.

16:39.773 --> 16:41.307
[BANGS GAVEL]

16:42.807 --> 16:44.307
THAT WAS BIG.

16:44.373 --> 16:47.173
ALL THEY
REALLY HAVE NOW
IS THE FINGERPRINTS.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.740
I LIKE IT.

16:48.807 --> 16:53.440
SHE IS A NASTY LITTLE
SNACK TREAT, ISN'T SHE?

16:57.307 --> 16:59.407
I WASN'T TRYING
TO AFFECT COMMERCE.

16:59.473 --> 17:00.673
Ellenor:
HOW MANY HANDBAGS

17:00.740 --> 17:01.773
DO YOU THINK YOU'VE
SNATCHED, WARREN?

17:01.840 --> 17:03.540
HOW MANY TIMES
I BEEN ARRESTED?

17:03.607 --> 17:05.607
4.

17:05.673 --> 17:07.707
4...

17:07.772 --> 17:10.406
5 COUNTING THE ONE
I GAVE BACK.

17:10.473 --> 17:12.873
ALL RIGHT, WARREN, LET'S
NOT LIE TO THIS JURY.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.173
YOU SWIPE HANDBAGS.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.440
BUT NEVER, EVER, EVER
TO AFFECT COMMERCE.

17:18.507 --> 17:20.540
SEE, THERE'S
2 THINGS I LOVE:

17:20.607 --> 17:23.772
MY COUNTRY AND HANDBAGS.

17:26.906 --> 17:29.140
YOU THINK
YOU'RE CUTE, HUH?

17:29.207 --> 17:31.473
YOU THINK YOU
CAN STEAL FROM PEOPLE
AND GET AWAY WITH IT

17:31.540 --> 17:33.040
WITH A WINK AND A SMILE?

17:33.107 --> 17:34.640
MY PERSONALITY
IS MY BEST STRENGTH.

17:34.707 --> 17:36.640
WELL, TRY TO
LET THIS SINK IN.

17:36.707 --> 17:40.173
WE HAVE A JUDGE WHO IS
TRYING TO SET AN EXAMPLE
FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.340
AT EVERY TURN, HE
IS STEERING THAT JURY
TO FIND YOU GUILTY.

17:43.407 --> 17:44.873
IF YOU GO TO PRISON--

17:44.940 --> 17:47.873
LOOK AT ME.
IF YOU GO TO PRISON,

17:47.940 --> 17:51.307
YOUR BUNKMATES,
THEY'RE GONNA FIND YOU
REALLY CUTE.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.807
YOU'RE A GOOD KID,
WARREN.

17:55.873 --> 17:57.807
I DON'T WANT
YOUR LIFE TO BE OVER.

17:57.873 --> 18:00.407
BUT IF WE LOSE HERE...

18:00.473 --> 18:04.340
IT IS TIME
TO PLAY GROWNUP.

18:07.907 --> 18:09.207
I THINK
WE GOT A SHOT.

18:09.273 --> 18:10.307
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.

18:10.373 --> 18:11.840
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE.
IT'S JOEY'S WORD
AGAINST MARTY'S.

18:11.907 --> 18:13.407
CAN'T THEY TELL
FROM THE ENTRY WOUND

18:13.473 --> 18:14.540
WHO DID
THE THRUSTING?

18:14.607 --> 18:16.040
NOT TO A MEDICAL
CERTAINTY.

18:16.107 --> 18:17.940
SO BIG JOEY COULD BE
OUT ON THE STREET,
FREE TO DATE?

18:18.007 --> 18:19.607
THERE'S STILL FORENSICS.

18:19.673 --> 18:21.507
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT'S GONNA TELL US.

18:21.573 --> 18:22.440
[DOOR OPENS]

18:27.307 --> 18:30.173
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU GOT HIS ATTENTION.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.407
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:31.473 --> 18:33.307
SHE SUED HIM.

18:34.140 --> 18:37.340
IS THERE SOMEWHERE
WE CAN SPEAK IN PRIVATE?

18:55.607 --> 18:59.540
ON WHAT BASIS DO YOU
SUE MY FIRM OR ME?

18:59.607 --> 19:01.607
ON THE BASIS OF A HUNCH.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.107
YOU'RE HIDING DOCUMENTS,

19:03.173 --> 19:05.007
OR YOU'RE HELPING
YOUR CLIENTS HIDE THEM.

19:05.073 --> 19:07.140
WE COULD SETTLE
RIGHT NOW AND MAKE IT
ALL GO AWAY.

19:07.207 --> 19:09.140
LAWYERS ARE EXPECTED
TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT,

19:09.207 --> 19:11.473
BUT TO STOOP TO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS...

19:13.273 --> 19:16.840
JUST THIS MORNING I WAS
TRYING TO PERSUADE YOU
NOT TO BECOME SOMETHING

19:16.907 --> 19:19.707
THAT YOU'VE CLEARLY
ALREADY BECOME.

19:19.773 --> 19:20.740
WHAT I'VE BECOME,
PROFESSOR,

19:20.807 --> 19:23.273
IS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
QUITE TRUST YOU

19:23.340 --> 19:24.607
WHEN YOU OR YOUR FIRM

19:24.673 --> 19:27.240
CLAIM YOU HAVE
NO STUDIES CONCERNING
SMOKING AND CANCER.

19:27.307 --> 19:29.873
IF YOU HAD READ
OUR RESPONSES CAREFULLY,

19:29.940 --> 19:31.840
WE CLAIM TO HAVE NO
DISCOVERABLE STUDIES.

19:31.907 --> 19:33.107
MEANING WHAT,

19:33.173 --> 19:34.607
THEY'RE PROTECTED BY
ATTORNEY-CLIENT
PRIVILEGE?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.207
I DON'T THINKS SO.

19:36.273 --> 19:37.807
YOU THINK YOU REALLY
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

19:37.873 --> 19:40.173
TO GO UP AGAINST
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY?

19:40.240 --> 19:43.407
YOUR CLIENTS LIKE
TO BULLY ANYBODY
WHO DARES TO SUE.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.273
YOU WON'T
BE BULLYING ME.

19:45.340 --> 19:49.173
I'LL BE IN COURT PERSONALLY
TO RESPOND TO YOUR MOTION.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.773
THEN THIS DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE GOOD-BYE.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.340
I--

20:01.273 --> 20:03.440
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

20:21.664 --> 20:22.831
THE DAY OF, THE 15th?

20:22.898 --> 20:25.064
ABOUT 7 HOURS BEFORE HE
WAS KILLED, MS. GAMBLE.

20:25.131 --> 20:27.498
TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAID, DOCTOR.

20:27.564 --> 20:29.931
BASICALLY, THAT
OVER THE LAST 3 WEEKS,

20:29.998 --> 20:32.964
MR. HERIC HAD
BEEN SUBJECTING HIM
TO MENTAL TORTURE,

20:33.031 --> 20:34.864
GUISED THREATS.

20:34.931 --> 20:37.331
HE'D KEPT TELLING HIM,
FOR EXAMPLE, HE SHOULD
HAVE A PHYSICAL,

20:37.398 --> 20:40.564
THAT HE LOOKED LIKE
A MAN WITH IMPENDING
HEART PROBLEMS.

20:40.631 --> 20:42.031
HEART PROBLEMS?

20:42.098 --> 20:43.664
CHEST PAINS.

20:43.731 --> 20:47.564
MARTY THOUGHT THESE
WERE VEILED THREATS
TO HIS LIFE.

20:50.398 --> 20:52.364
BUT SHE CAN'T TESTIFY,
RIGHT? THAT WOULD ALL
BE HEARSAY, WOULDN'T IT?

20:52.431 --> 20:54.231
NO. SINCE SHE
WAS HIS SHRINK,

20:54.298 --> 20:56.864
IT ALL GETS IN
UNDER DOCTOR-PATIENT
COMMUNICATIONS.

20:56.931 --> 20:59.131
JOEY, HE WENT TO
HIS PSYCHIATRIST
THAT VERY DAY

20:59.198 --> 21:01.964
SAYING HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE ABOUT TO
KILL HIM.

21:02.031 --> 21:02.998
CRYBABY.

21:03.064 --> 21:05.298
WE HAVE TO THINK PLEA.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.264
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.364
WE CAN'T--

21:07.431 --> 21:08.364
BOBBY. BOBBY,
IT IS ONE WITNESS.

21:08.431 --> 21:09.898
JURIES DON'T
LIKE PSYCHIATRISTS.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.931
IT'S GONNA TAKE THEM
MORE THAN ONE WITNESS
TO MAKE THEIR BURDEN.

21:11.998 --> 21:13.564
IS THIS HOW YOU
PRACTICE LAW,

21:13.631 --> 21:14.664
ONE SETBACK AND YOU'RE
READY TO GIVE UP?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.731
HE'S DEAD. NOTHING
HE SAID CAN COME IN.

21:16.798 --> 21:18.664
I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CONFRONT MY ACCUSER,
DO I NOT?

21:18.731 --> 21:20.198
IT'S GONNA
COME INTO EVIDENCE.

21:20.264 --> 21:22.364
WE HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT A POSSIBLE
INSANITY PLEA HERE.

21:22.431 --> 21:23.598
NO!
JOEY!

21:23.664 --> 21:25.164
NO, I'M NOT GOING
TO PLEAD INSANITY.

21:25.231 --> 21:26.598
I THREW THAT OUT
AS A JOKE.

21:26.664 --> 21:27.731
I WILL NOT GO
INTO THAT COURTROOM--

21:27.798 --> 21:29.031
SHUT UP AND
LISTEN TO ME!

21:29.098 --> 21:31.198
DON'T EVER TELL ME
TO SHUT UP, BOBBY!

21:31.264 --> 21:34.064
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
ANY DECISIONS RIGHT NOW.

21:34.131 --> 21:38.864
BUT I HAVE TO EXPLORE
ALL OUR OPTIONS
SO WE HAVE OPTIONS.

21:56.364 --> 22:00.598
YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT A PSYCHIATRIST
YOU USED TO SEE.

22:00.664 --> 22:03.564
I NEED YOU
TO AUTHORIZE HIM

22:03.631 --> 22:05.564
TO SPEAK TO ME.

22:10.464 --> 22:12.431
I DO NOT APPRECIATE
STUNTS, MS. DOLE.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.564
YOUR HONOR, LOOK AT THEIR
RESPONSES TO OUR MOTION
TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS.

22:15.631 --> 22:19.131
WE ASKED FOR STUDIES
WHICH GO TO THEIR MARKETING
STRATEGIES, ADVERTISING.

22:19.198 --> 22:22.664
THEY CLAIM THEY'RE PROTECTED
BY ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE.

22:22.731 --> 22:24.831
MUCH OF THEIR
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

22:24.898 --> 22:25.998
INVOLVED MEETINGS
WITH LAWYERS.

22:26.064 --> 22:28.264
THAT'S JUST A SHAM.

22:28.331 --> 22:30.598
THIS GOES ON WITH THEIR
STUDIES ON ADDICTION, TOO.

22:30.664 --> 22:32.831
THEY HAD THEIR LAWYERS
SUPERVISE THE RESEARCH

22:32.898 --> 22:34.864
SO IF ANY OF THE RESULTS
COME BACK BAD,

22:34.931 --> 22:37.731
THEY CAN CONCEAL IT,
CLAIMING PRIVILEGE.

22:37.798 --> 22:40.798
WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU
HAVE THAT THIS IS
GOING ON HERE NOW?

22:40.864 --> 22:42.898
EVIDENCE OF
COMMON SENSE.

22:42.964 --> 22:44.998
YOU DON'T HIRE ATTORNEYS
TO DO YOUR SCIENCE.

22:45.064 --> 22:48.331
YOU DON'T HIRE ATTORNEYS
TO DEVELOP ADVERTISING
CAMPAIGNS.

22:48.398 --> 22:50.964
YOUR HONOR, SHE'S
ASKING YOU TO OBLITERATE
THE PRIVILEGE

22:51.031 --> 22:53.431
BETWEEN LAWYER AND CLIENT.
THIS IS A SANCTITY--

22:53.498 --> 22:55.898
WHICH SHOULDN'T
BE ABUSED.

22:55.964 --> 22:58.398
SO I SHOULD GIVE
YOU THESE DOCUMENTS
JUST BECAUSE--

22:58.464 --> 23:00.098
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GIVE THEM TO ME.

23:00.164 --> 23:02.631
APPOINT A SPECIAL MASTER
TO DO IT, OR DO IT YOURSELF.

23:02.698 --> 23:04.164
YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES.

23:04.231 --> 23:06.298
IF YOU THINK THEY FALL
UNDER ATTORNEY-CLIENT
PRIVILEGE,

23:06.364 --> 23:09.864
I'LL TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR IT.
I WON'T TAKE HIS.

23:09.931 --> 23:12.764
THIS IS A RIDICULOUS
FISHING EXPEDITION,

23:12.831 --> 23:15.964
AND I WOULD ASK YOUR HONOR
TO TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE

23:16.031 --> 23:20.364
OF THE DISREPUTABLE STUNTS
EMPLOYED BY HER FIRM
HISTORICALLY.

23:20.431 --> 23:22.064
STOP ATTACKING MY FIRM,
PROFESSOR!

23:22.131 --> 23:24.464
Judge: ALL RIGHT!

23:24.531 --> 23:26.531
I AM DISMISSING
THE COMPLAINT

23:26.598 --> 23:29.031
AGAINST MR. PEARSON
AND HIS LAW FIRM.

23:29.098 --> 23:31.098
I SEE NO FOUNDATION.

23:31.164 --> 23:34.631
AS FOR THE MATTER
OF THE DOCUMENTATION
PRODUCTION,

23:34.698 --> 23:37.198
I SHALL TAKE
THAT MATTER UNDER
ADVISEMENT.

23:37.264 --> 23:38.198
[BANGS GAVEL]

23:38.264 --> 23:39.564
ADJOURNED.

23:48.564 --> 23:50.731
8 YEARS?

23:50.798 --> 23:52.531
YEAH.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.531
THAT'S
THEIR FINAL OFFER.

23:54.598 --> 23:56.098
FOR STEALING A BAG?

23:56.164 --> 23:58.131
WARREN,

23:58.198 --> 23:59.798
MY RECOMMENDATION?

23:59.864 --> 24:01.998
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO TAKE IT.

24:02.064 --> 24:03.064
AND I MIGHT NOT!

24:03.131 --> 24:04.798
OBVIOUSLY, THINGS
AREN'T GOING VERY WELL.

24:04.864 --> 24:06.831
IF WE LOSE, THAT JUDGE,

24:06.898 --> 24:09.564
HE COULD HIT YOU
WITH 20, WARREN.

24:15.431 --> 24:17.564
20 YEARS?

24:23.698 --> 24:26.198
I AM JUST AFRAID
OF THE JUDGE SLAPPING
THE MAXIMUM.

24:26.264 --> 24:28.164
DO YOU HAVE A BEAT
ON THE JURY?
NOT REALLY.

24:28.231 --> 24:29.664
AND I WOULDN'T RELY ON
THEM BEING SYMPATHETIC.

24:29.731 --> 24:31.064
I MEAN, HE IS A THIEF.

24:31.131 --> 24:33.564
THE PROBLEM WITH A PLEA
YOU'LL WAIVE YOUR APPEALS,

24:33.631 --> 24:35.731
AND WITH THIS CASE,
YOU'VE GOT SOME,

24:35.798 --> 24:36.931
ESPECIALLY
WITH THAT JUDGE.

24:36.998 --> 24:39.031
YOU THINK I SHOULD
GO TO VERDICT?

24:39.098 --> 24:40.998
I WOULD.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.298
IT IS JUST SO UNFAIR.

24:43.364 --> 24:47.431
THEY ARE
USING HIM TO MAKE
A POLITICAL STATEMENT.

24:47.498 --> 24:48.864
ARGUE THAT.

24:53.398 --> 24:54.798
YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

24:54.864 --> 24:57.331
JOEY HERIC WILL NEVER
LET YOU ARGUE INSANITY.

24:57.398 --> 24:58.998
MAYBE NOT, BUT
I CAN AT LEAST TRY.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.631
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

25:01.698 --> 25:05.464
HE HAS A NARCISSISTIC
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

25:05.531 --> 25:07.398
ASIDE FROM NEEDING
TO BELIEVE HE'S SANE,

25:07.464 --> 25:11.498
HE NEEDS TO BELIEVE
HE'S SMARTER THAN
EVERYBODY ELSE.

25:11.564 --> 25:13.398
HAVEN'T YOU
EXPERIENCED THAT?

25:13.464 --> 25:15.131
OH, YES.

25:15.198 --> 25:18.298
AND THIS, UH, DISORDER,

25:18.364 --> 25:21.164
DO YOU CONSIDER HIM
MENTALLY ILL?

25:21.231 --> 25:24.431
VERY, THOUGH
IS HE INSANE UNDER
THE McNAUGHTEN RULE?

25:24.498 --> 25:26.464
NO, HE KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING

25:26.531 --> 25:29.164
WHEN HE
KILLED THOSE MEN.
IN FACT...

25:29.231 --> 25:30.231
IN FACT WHAT?

25:30.298 --> 25:31.331
WELL, LOOK AT
HOW HE DID IT.

25:31.398 --> 25:33.931
THIS IS A BRILLIANT
PERSON, GENIUS.

25:33.998 --> 25:35.898
IF HE WANTED TO PLAN
THE PERFECT CRIME

25:35.964 --> 25:37.831
IN ORDER TO
ESCAPE SUSPICION,

25:37.898 --> 25:39.498
HE COULD PROBABLY
ACCOMPLISH IT.

25:39.564 --> 25:42.098
INSTEAD, HE KILLS
WITH NO ALIBI,

25:42.164 --> 25:43.831
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THE ROOM WITH
THE VICTIM,

25:43.898 --> 25:45.298
HIS PRINTS
ON THE WEAPON,

25:45.364 --> 25:48.898
AND HE INVITES
HIS LAWYERS OVER
TO SEE HIS KILL,

25:48.964 --> 25:50.831
LIKE A CAT
WITH A DEAD MOUSE.

25:50.898 --> 25:53.864
IT'S AS IF
HE COMMITS A CRIME

25:53.931 --> 25:56.898
WHERE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
NOT TO CONVICT HIM

25:56.964 --> 26:00.398
AND THE GAME IS STILL
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

26:00.464 --> 26:01.831
WHICH FEEDS INTO
HIS NARCISSISM?

26:01.898 --> 26:03.898
EXACTLY.
THE DEEPER THE HOLE,

26:03.964 --> 26:06.064
THE GREATER THE EUPHORIA
OF CLIMBING OUT. WHY?

26:06.131 --> 26:11.864
BECAUSE HE NEEDS
TO FEEL HE'S SMARTER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

26:16.031 --> 26:17.431
I TOLD YOU, NO.

26:17.498 --> 26:18.931
FIRST, HEAR ME OUT.

26:18.998 --> 26:20.998
LEGAL INSANITY FOR
THE PURPOSE OF A TRIAL--

26:21.064 --> 26:21.931
NO!

26:21.998 --> 26:23.231
YOU CONSIDERED IT
YOURSELF. YOU SAID--

26:23.298 --> 26:24.298
IN JEST.

26:24.364 --> 26:25.798
IT'S TOO DESPERATE.

26:25.864 --> 26:28.164
NO JURY IS GOING
TO BELIEVE I AM INSANE.

26:28.231 --> 26:29.864
JOEY, I CAN'T WIN THIS.
I'M LOOKING AT
THE FACTS,

26:29.931 --> 26:32.564
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
I CANNOT WIN THIS.

26:35.798 --> 26:38.564
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD
FIND ANOTHER LAWYER.

26:42.331 --> 26:44.598
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

26:47.498 --> 26:49.964
FINE. YOU'RE FIRED.
BEAT IT.

26:55.398 --> 26:58.531
YOU KNOW, I--I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHY I SHOULD
CARE ABOUT YOU.

26:58.598 --> 27:00.064
YOU KILLED 2 PEOPLE,

27:00.131 --> 27:02.498
AND IT SHOULDN'T
REALLY BOTHER ME IF YOU
GO AWAY FOREVER.

27:02.564 --> 27:07.198
YOUR ARROGANCE
GOT YOU THIS FAR, JOEY.

27:07.264 --> 27:10.098
YOU REALLY
WANT TO KEEP GOING?

27:26.297 --> 27:27.964
ON WHAT GROUNDS DO
YOU WISH TO WITHDRAW?

27:28.031 --> 27:30.464
ON THE BASIS THAT
MY CLIENT FIRED ME,
YOUR HONOR.

27:30.531 --> 27:31.931
MR. HERIC,

27:31.997 --> 27:33.664
ARE YOU CITING GROUNDS
FOR THE DISCHARGE?

27:33.731 --> 27:35.097
YES, YOUR HONOR.

27:35.164 --> 27:38.297
LAST NIGHT, MR. DONNELL
INFORMED ME THAT
HE'S A LESBIAN.

27:39.597 --> 27:41.931
MR. HERIC, FROM WHAT
I'VE LEARNED ABOUT YOU,

27:41.997 --> 27:44.064
YOU MIGHT PLAY
THIS LITTLE GAME
IN PERPETUITY.

27:44.131 --> 27:45.464
YOU'LL HIRE
AND FIRE LAWYERS

27:45.531 --> 27:47.764
UNTIL IT'LL BE YEARS
BEFORE WE GET TO TRIAL.

27:47.831 --> 27:49.797
I AM READY NOW,
YOUR HONOR.

27:49.864 --> 27:51.897
I JUST WISH
TO REPRESENT MYSELF.

27:51.964 --> 27:52.964
Judge:
ARE YOU A LAWYER?

27:53.031 --> 27:54.731
NO, BUT IF I
KEEP KILLING PEOPLE,

27:54.797 --> 27:57.064
I FIGURE THEY'LL LET ME
IN HELL ANYWAY.

27:57.131 --> 27:58.797
PUT THIS MAN
BACK IN CUSTODY.

27:58.864 --> 28:02.364
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO TREAT THIS FORUM
SERIOUSLY, MR. HERIC,

28:02.431 --> 28:03.564
WE CAN RESUME.

28:03.631 --> 28:06.131
YOUR HONOR,
NO, PLEASE, I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY SORRY. LISTEN.

28:06.197 --> 28:09.531
MR. DONNELL WANTS TO
UTILIZE AN INSANITY PLEA,

28:09.597 --> 28:11.331
WHICH I AM OPPOSED TO.

28:11.397 --> 28:13.831
DESPITE NO FORMAL
LEGAL TRAINING,

28:13.897 --> 28:15.797
I DO BELIEVE THAT
I CAN REPRESENT MYSELF

28:15.864 --> 28:17.831
BETTER THAN ANY
MEMBER OF THE BAR.

28:17.897 --> 28:20.564
I'M ORDERING A
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION,

28:20.631 --> 28:22.797
AND WE'LL DO THAT TODAY
TO DETERMINE COMPETENCY.

28:22.864 --> 28:26.431
AND, IF POSSIBLE, I'LL
RULE ON YOUR REQUEST AT
THE END OF BUSINESS.

28:26.497 --> 28:28.031
WE'RE ADJOURNED.

28:28.997 --> 28:31.364
IT'S A PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD LAW:

28:31.431 --> 28:35.331
WHOEVER AFFECTS COMMERCE
BY ROBBERY OR EXTORTION.

28:35.397 --> 28:39.197
CRIME HAS A DIRECT IMPACT
ON TOURISM.

28:39.264 --> 28:42.164
TOURISM IS
A FORM OF COMMERCE.

28:42.231 --> 28:44.197
THIS MAN

28:44.264 --> 28:46.564
ROBS TOURISTS.

28:46.631 --> 28:47.897
SIMPLE.

28:49.831 --> 28:52.231
Ellenor: THIS SIMPLE LAW,

28:52.297 --> 28:53.931
THE HOBBS ACT,

28:53.997 --> 28:56.631
IT WASN'T PASSED
TO GO AFTER PURSE-SNATCHERS,

28:56.697 --> 29:00.164
IT WASN'T MEANT TO
TARGET PEOPLE WHO STEAL
FROM TOURISTS.

29:00.231 --> 29:02.597
THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT
OF THE HOBBS ACT

29:02.664 --> 29:05.697
WAS TO GO AFTER
ORGANIZED CRIME AND
OTHER RACKETEERS

29:05.764 --> 29:08.231
WHO EXTORT POLITICIANS,

29:08.297 --> 29:11.364
AND IT IS BEING MANIPULATED
HERE TO GO AFTER MY CLIENT.

29:11.431 --> 29:12.297
WHY?

29:12.364 --> 29:13.831
BECAUSE THE COMMONWEALTH
OF MASSACHUSETTS

29:13.897 --> 29:15.931
WANTS A PRESS RELEASE

29:15.997 --> 29:17.397
TO CONVINCE
ALL THE TOURISTS--

29:17.464 --> 29:19.531
I OBJECT! NONE OF
THIS WAS OFFERED
INTO EVIDENCE.

29:19.597 --> 29:21.764
I AGREE.
OBJECTION SUSTAINED.

29:21.831 --> 29:25.964
COUNSEL WILL NOT ARGUE
THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT
OF THE LAW.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.864
THE INTENT OF THE LAW
ISN'T RELEVANT?

29:27.931 --> 29:29.697
NO, IT IS NOT.

29:29.764 --> 29:33.931
THE JURY WILL BE
INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW
THE LETTER OF THE LAW.

29:38.864 --> 29:42.231
AS WAS ADMITTED
INTO EVIDENCE,

29:42.297 --> 29:45.197
MY CLIENT PLED GUILTY
IN STATE COURT,

29:45.264 --> 29:47.964
AND HE RECEIVED
HIS SENTENCE.

29:48.031 --> 29:50.931
THE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS
ARE USING THIS GUILTY PLEA

29:50.997 --> 29:53.931
TO GO AFTER HIM,
AND, WELL, HERE WE ARE

29:53.997 --> 29:58.297
PROSECUTING HIM
FOR COMMERCE VIOLATIONS.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.097
NOW, AS
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY,

30:01.164 --> 30:03.664
I FEEL THE STING
OF ALL THE ATTACKS.

30:03.731 --> 30:05.064
THE STUNTS
THAT WE RESORT TO,

30:05.131 --> 30:06.964
THE TRICKS
TO GET THE GUY OFF,

30:07.031 --> 30:08.831
DISTORTING THE LAW
TO CIRCUMVENT JUSTICE,

30:08.897 --> 30:11.664
ALL THE LITTLE SNEAKY
TRICKS THAT WE PLAY.

30:11.731 --> 30:14.964
AND THE POOR PROSECUTORS,

30:15.031 --> 30:16.797
WITH THOSE SLEAZY
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS

30:16.864 --> 30:18.764
JUST USING ALL
THOSE END-AROUNDS,

30:18.831 --> 30:21.197
AND THE POOR JUDGES

30:21.264 --> 30:23.831
WHO SEE THEIR COURTROOMS
JUST USED AS TOOLS

30:23.897 --> 30:25.831
TO BASTARDIZE JUSTICE.

30:26.997 --> 30:32.364
THIS WOULD OTHERWISE BE
SUCH A PROUD, PROUD ROOM,

30:32.431 --> 30:34.431
WOULDN'T IT?

30:56.897 --> 31:00.331
I THOUGHT IT BEST
WE DO THIS IN CHAMBERS,

31:00.397 --> 31:01.864
OFF THE RECORD.

31:01.931 --> 31:04.731
EITHER OF YOU OBJECT,
I CAN CALL IN THE STENO.

31:04.797 --> 31:07.164
I'M FINE.

31:07.231 --> 31:08.531
ALL RIGHT.

31:08.597 --> 31:12.331
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE
HAS ALWAYS BEEN SACROSANCT.

31:12.397 --> 31:14.164
IT HAS TO BE.

31:14.231 --> 31:18.597
AND I PITY THE JUDGE
WHO TRIES TO TEAR
THE LID OFF.

31:18.664 --> 31:21.997
BUT, MR. PEARSON,

31:22.064 --> 31:25.631
YOU HAVE SWEPT EVERYTHING
UNDER PRIVILEGE HERE.

31:25.697 --> 31:29.197
YOUR HONOR, BECAUSE
THE TOBACCO COMPANIES
HAVE BEEN SUED,

31:29.264 --> 31:32.231
A LOT OF THOSE STUDIES
HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED TO
FIGHT OFF LITIGATION.

31:32.297 --> 31:34.831
THOSE STUDIES WILL
FALL UNDER PRIVILEGE.

31:34.897 --> 31:36.831
YES, YOU MADE THAT
ARGUMENT IN COURT

31:36.897 --> 31:38.831
AND TO SOME EXTENT
IT'S VALID.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.964
BUT WHEN LAWYERS START
GUIDING THE RESEARCH--

31:43.031 --> 31:44.897
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT'S HAPPENED.

31:44.964 --> 31:47.497
THERE IS OTHER EVIDENCE
THAT OTHER TOBACCO COMPANIES

31:47.564 --> 31:50.764
HAVE USED PRIVILEGE TO COVER
UP SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.

31:50.831 --> 31:53.597
AND JUDGING FROM
MY REVIEW OF THIS CASE,

31:53.664 --> 31:56.197
I HAVE A STRONG SUSPICION
THAT IT'S HAPPENING HERE,

31:56.264 --> 32:01.464
SO STRONG THAT I AM
INCLINED TO TAKE A LOOK.

32:01.531 --> 32:03.264
NOW, MR. PEARSON,

32:03.331 --> 32:09.164
WE BOTH KNOW THAT THERE
IS A CRIME/FRAUD EXCEPTION.

32:09.231 --> 32:13.131
SO IF YOU HAVE BEEN USING
YOUR ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

32:13.197 --> 32:16.131
TO ASSIST
THE TOBACCO COMPANY

32:16.197 --> 32:18.797
IN ANY SORT OF COVER-UP,

32:18.864 --> 32:21.597
THE CONSEQUENCES
WILL BE SEVERE

32:21.664 --> 32:24.464
FOR YOUR CLIENT
AND FOR YOU.

32:25.631 --> 32:28.097
NOW, I HAVEN'T MADE
MY RULING YET IN THIS CASE

32:28.164 --> 32:30.464
BECAUSE THE ISSUE
IS SO COMPLICATED.

32:30.531 --> 32:35.397
AND I KNOW THAT ANY RULING
AGAINST YOU IN THIS MATTER,
I AM SURE,

32:35.464 --> 32:39.597
WILL BE APPEALED
TO THE MILLENNIUM,
GIVEN THE STAKES.

32:39.664 --> 32:43.431
SO, MY SUGGESTION HERE...

32:44.297 --> 32:47.431
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
TRY TO WORK IT OUT?

32:56.364 --> 32:57.731
75,000.

32:57.797 --> 32:58.731
TIMES 10.

32:58.797 --> 32:59.797
OH, PLEASE.

32:59.864 --> 33:01.197
YOU CAN'T EVEN
SHOW DAMAGES.

33:01.264 --> 33:03.331
THE DAMAGE HERE
WILL BE YOURS.

33:03.397 --> 33:07.264
YOU CAN'T RISK
LETTING THAT JUDGE SEE
SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS.

33:07.331 --> 33:09.831
IT'S NOW 10:15. I'LL BE
AT YOUR OFFICE AT 3:00.

33:09.897 --> 33:12.164
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHECK
FOR $750,000,

33:12.231 --> 33:13.831
IT'LL GO UP TO A MILLION.

33:13.897 --> 33:15.897
THINK THAT'S A BLUFF?
YOUR PREROGATIVE.

33:15.964 --> 33:17.731
BUT WHAT WE JUST
HEARD IN THERE,

33:17.797 --> 33:19.697
THAT WAS NO BLUFF.

33:19.764 --> 33:20.697
3:00.

33:20.764 --> 33:22.297
SHARP.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.364
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
A SERIES OF QUESTIONS.

33:31.431 --> 33:34.297
SOME WILL BE UNRELATED.

33:34.364 --> 33:39.297
MAINLY, I'M LOOKING
TO DETERMINE WHETHER
YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND

33:39.364 --> 33:43.564
THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDING
WHICH YOU ARE ABOUT
TO ENCOUNTER.

33:43.631 --> 33:44.964
DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT?

33:45.031 --> 33:47.031
JOEY, DO YOU WANNA BE
JUDGED COMPETENT OR NOT?

33:47.097 --> 33:49.164
AS YOU SAID, I COULD
BE FOUND COMPETENT
TO STAND TRIAL,

33:49.231 --> 33:51.197
ONLY TO BE
JUDGED INSANE.

33:51.264 --> 33:53.731
I COULD PLEAD INSANITY
IF I WANTED,

33:53.797 --> 33:55.264
NOT THAT I WILL,

33:55.331 --> 33:58.031
BUT ONLY IF
THIS LITTLE BUTTON
FINDS ME COMPETENT.

33:58.097 --> 34:01.497
SHOULD I UNDERSTAND
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM, MILDRED?

34:01.564 --> 34:03.897
CAN I CALL YOU
MILDRED?

34:03.964 --> 34:05.897
WHERE DID YOU KILL
THIS MARTY PERSON?

34:05.964 --> 34:07.331
YOU CAN'T ASK THAT.

34:07.397 --> 34:08.397
THAT'S RIGHT.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.664
THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE
FOR A COMPETENCY
HEARING.

34:10.731 --> 34:11.697
BUT...

34:11.764 --> 34:13.664
I'LL TELL YOU.

34:13.731 --> 34:16.630
IF I KILLED HIM,

34:16.697 --> 34:19.897
IT WAS BECAUSE
I LOVED HIM.

34:19.964 --> 34:22.731
EITHER THAT OR
BECAUSE HE WAS GAY.

34:22.797 --> 34:23.797
Bobby: JOEY!

34:23.864 --> 34:24.797
WHAT CAN I SAY?
GOD SPOKE TO ME.

34:24.864 --> 34:26.264
HE SAID GET RID
OF THE HOMOS.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.697
HE SAID HE'D BEEN
TRYING, YOU KNOW,
WITH THE AIDS VIRUS,

34:28.764 --> 34:30.197
BUT WITH A.Z.T.
SLOWING THINGS DOWN,

34:30.264 --> 34:32.331
HE SAID,
"JOEY, GET IN THERE.

34:32.397 --> 34:33.464
GIVE IT A STAB."

34:33.531 --> 34:35.630
AREN'T YOU GAY?

34:35.697 --> 34:38.197
YES.

34:38.264 --> 34:40.797
BUT IF I
KILLED MYSELF FIRST,

34:40.864 --> 34:44.331
THAT WOULD SORT
OF LIMIT MY TALLY.

34:51.831 --> 34:54.297
THE DEFENDANT WILL RISE.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.364
THE JURY HAS
REACHED A VERDICT?

35:00.431 --> 35:01.397
WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

35:01.464 --> 35:03.464
PLEASE STATE YOUR VERDICT.

35:03.531 --> 35:06.531
ON THE MATTER OF
<i>UNITED STATES</i>
<i>VS. CRUICKSHANK,</i>

35:06.597 --> 35:09.831
ON THE CHARGE OF
INTERFERING OF COMMERCE
BY THREATS OF VIOLENCE,

35:09.897 --> 35:13.764
PURSUANT TO TITLE 18,
SUBSECTION 1951,

35:13.831 --> 35:16.297
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT
WARREN CRUICKSHANK

35:16.364 --> 35:17.264
NOT GUILTY.

35:23.697 --> 35:25.297
THE JURY IS DISMISSED.

35:25.364 --> 35:26.297
WE'RE ADJOURNED.

35:26.364 --> 35:27.297
[GAVEL BANGS]

35:35.697 --> 35:37.164
YOUR HONOR?

35:37.231 --> 35:39.164
GIVEN THE RISK
OF SAYING THIS--

35:39.231 --> 35:40.697
I BROUGHT MY TOOTHBRUSH--

35:40.764 --> 35:44.031
THAT JURY JUST BROUGHT
SOME INTEGRITY BACK
INTO THIS ROOM.

35:44.097 --> 35:46.531
AND AS AN OFFICER
OF THE COURT,

35:46.597 --> 35:50.897
I WOULD ASK THAT YOU WOULD
LET A LITTLE OF IT RUB OFF.

36:00.231 --> 36:02.297
DO YOU HAVE
THE CHECK?

36:06.397 --> 36:07.297
SIT DOWN.

36:14.031 --> 36:19.231
AS I LOOK AT YOU AS
ONE OF MY LAW STUDENTS,

36:19.297 --> 36:22.564
I FEEL THAT I HAVE FAILED
AS A PROFESSOR.

36:22.631 --> 36:27.897
THE PRACTICE OF LAW
IS MORE THAN JUST
GETTING ACQUITTALS

36:27.964 --> 36:29.797
OR MONETARY AWARDS.

36:29.864 --> 36:32.764
IT INVOLVES RESPECT
FOR THE BAR,

36:32.831 --> 36:34.364
DIGNITY IN CONDUCT.

36:34.431 --> 36:38.431
SUING LAW FIRMS
AND ATTORNEYS PERSONALLY

36:38.497 --> 36:40.897
AS A MEANS OF STRATEGY...

36:44.297 --> 36:47.297
THERE IS NOTHING NOBLE
IN YOU, LINDSAY.

36:52.731 --> 36:55.297
TAKE YOUR MONEY
AND GET OUT.

37:17.264 --> 37:19.331
MY FIRM
DEFENDS MURDERERS,

37:19.397 --> 37:20.931
DRUG DEALERS...

37:20.997 --> 37:22.797
ON THE THEORY THAT
DESPITE THE CRIME,

37:22.864 --> 37:24.564
EVERYBODY GETS
HIS DAY IN COURT.

37:24.631 --> 37:27.697
BUT WE NEVER,
EVER FACILITATE
MURDER, PROFESSOR,

37:27.764 --> 37:28.964
WE NEVER HELP PEOPLE
TO KILL.

37:29.031 --> 37:30.831
YOU'RE PAID OVER
$1 MILLION A YEAR

37:30.897 --> 37:32.964
TO HELP A CORPORATION
CONCEAL THE TRUTH

37:33.031 --> 37:34.531
THAT THEY POISON PEOPLE,

37:34.597 --> 37:37.264
A CORPORATION
WHICH AIMS TO GET
14-YEAR-OLDS ADDICTED,

37:37.331 --> 37:39.797
A CORPORATION THAT STILL,
IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES,

37:39.864 --> 37:40.797
DOESN'T EVEN
PRINT WARNINGS

37:40.864 --> 37:42.864
BECAUSE BY LAW
THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

37:42.931 --> 37:45.364
3 MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR
DIE FROM SMOKING,

37:45.431 --> 37:47.164
AND YOU PLAY YOUR PART.

37:47.231 --> 37:49.764
LET'S MEET UP AT
THE END OF OUR DAYS

37:49.831 --> 37:52.297
AND COMPARE LEGACIES.

38:05.297 --> 38:07.297
ALL RIGHT.
THE COURT PSYCHIATRIST

38:07.364 --> 38:08.831
HAS SERIOUS QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOU, MR. HERIC,

38:08.897 --> 38:11.831
BUT SHE HAS NEVERTHELESS
FOUND YOU COMPETENT.

38:11.897 --> 38:13.197
IF YOU CHOOSE
TO REPRESENT YOURSELF,

38:13.264 --> 38:15.097
THIS COURT
SHOULD NOT PREVENT THAT,

38:15.164 --> 38:17.464
THOUGH IT IS
THE RECOMMENDATION OF
THIS COURT THAT YOU DON'T.

38:17.531 --> 38:20.697
IT REMAINS YOUR WISH TO
SERVE AS YOUR OWN COUNSEL?

38:20.764 --> 38:21.731
IT DOES.

38:21.797 --> 38:23.297
VERY WELL.

38:23.364 --> 38:25.697
MR. DONNELL,
THE COURT ORDERS YOU
TO STAY ON AS COUNSEL

38:25.764 --> 38:28.231
TO ASSIST MR. HERIC,
SHOULD HE CHOOSE
TO CONSULT YOU.

38:28.297 --> 38:29.764
YOUR HONOR,
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A--

38:29.831 --> 38:31.364
I'VE MADE MY RULING.

38:31.431 --> 38:34.331
HE CAN REPRESENT HIMSELF
WITH YOU AS BACKUP.

38:34.397 --> 38:35.264
ADJOURNED.

38:35.331 --> 38:39.497
WELL, WIN OR LOSE,
WON'T THIS BE FUN?

38:39.564 --> 38:43.831
UH, HELEN, I'LL NEED
ALL THE INCULPATORY
AND EXCULPATORY REPORTS

38:43.897 --> 38:45.397
IN MY CELL BY MORNING.

38:45.464 --> 38:47.164
THE SOONER I GET
YOUR WITNESS LIST,
THE BETTER.

38:47.231 --> 38:51.164
AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING
THAT YOU OCCASIONALLY SLEEP
WITH THE OPPOSING COUNSEL.

38:51.231 --> 38:55.197
I WILL BE FIRST-CHAIRING.

38:55.264 --> 38:58.697
MR. HERIC, I'M THRILLED
YOU'VE DECIDED
TO REPRESENT YOURSELF.

38:58.764 --> 39:01.031
YOUR LITTLE JOYRIDE
IS OVER.

39:03.397 --> 39:05.197
SHE'S DELICIOUS.

39:05.264 --> 39:07.731
OH, PLEASE,
PROMISE ME THIS.

39:07.797 --> 39:08.797
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

39:08.864 --> 39:11.031
WE ALL COME OUT
AS FRIENDS.

39:21.364 --> 39:22.264
HEY, WARREN.

39:22.331 --> 39:23.364
HEY, ELLENOR.

39:23.431 --> 39:25.897
UH, I BOUGHT YOU A GIFT.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.631
IT AIN'T MUCH,
BUT, UH...

39:29.697 --> 39:32.797
WELL, I JUST
WANTED TO SAY, UH...

39:32.864 --> 39:35.864
I DON'T EXACTLY
PAY YOU BIG FEES,

39:35.931 --> 39:37.764
AND WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER
THAT GOOD,

39:37.831 --> 39:40.697
AND ALL
MY SMART-ASSIN'...

39:40.764 --> 39:44.231
I JUST WANTED TO SAY...

39:44.297 --> 39:48.331
I NEVER HAD ANYBODY
FIGHT FOR ME...

39:48.397 --> 39:50.164
LIKE YOU DID,

39:50.231 --> 39:52.431
AND I'LL NEVER
FORGET IT.

39:56.264 --> 39:57.297
NEVER.

40:07.564 --> 40:11.364
JUST WHEN I WONDERED
WHY I PUT UP WITH IT ALL.

40:15.464 --> 40:16.831
THE JUDGE STUCK ME ON.

40:16.897 --> 40:18.297
I GOTTA STAY ON
THE JOEY HERIC CASE.

40:18.364 --> 40:19.297
BOBBY.

40:20.864 --> 40:23.197
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW...

40:23.264 --> 40:26.297
THIS IS THE BEST
LAW FIRM I KNOW.

40:30.364 --> 40:31.297
THANKS.

40:34.397 --> 40:35.331
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

40:35.397 --> 40:37.331
WHAT IS IT?

40:37.397 --> 40:38.897
IT'S A HANDBAG.

41:46.864 --> 41:48.431
YOU STINKER!
