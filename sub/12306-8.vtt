00:01.000 --> 00:04.595
[music playing]

00:08.039 --> 00:09.337
Bill.
Mark.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.796
You a, uh, breast
or a thigh man?

00:10.810 --> 00:13.962
Oh, he knows better than
to answer that in public.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.630
It doesn't matter.
Thank you.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.778
Yeah.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.270
So they took out the
whole passenger window?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.350
Did they take
anything?

00:19.350 --> 00:21.045
No. Nothing
was taken. Heh.

00:21.050 --> 00:23.314
Just busted
the window.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.879
Just random vandalism?

00:24.890 --> 00:26.289
Did you call
the police?

00:26.290 --> 00:27.189
Why bother them?

00:27.190 --> 00:28.282
He fixed
the window himself.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.689
He's actually pretty
handy, this one.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.158
He's good to have
around, you know?

00:31.160 --> 00:33.720
You better watch
that smack.

00:33.730 --> 00:34.629
It's funny.

00:34.630 --> 00:38.066
[motorcycles approaching]

00:54.750 --> 00:57.913
Get landon.
Let's head home.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.682
Landon,
come on, baby.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.419
Hey. Come on. Let's
go inside, buddy.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.215
Who was that?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.119
Let's just go home.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.998
Come on.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.736
What is going on?

01:16.740 --> 01:19.732
Can we not right
now, honey?

01:24.750 --> 01:26.946
It's ok. Let's go
in your room, ok?

01:26.950 --> 01:31.342
"The emperor's place was
the most gorgeous palace

01:31.350 --> 01:32.340
"in the world,

01:32.350 --> 01:34.614
"built entirely
of fine porcelain,

01:34.620 --> 01:36.782
"so precious
but so brittle,

01:36.790 --> 01:38.053
"so delicate
to the touch

01:38.060 --> 01:41.724
That you had to be
very careful indeed."

[water running]

01:51.570 --> 01:53.868
[woman screams]

01:56.810 --> 01:58.699
Christina?

01:59.980 --> 02:02.039
Christina?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.217
Christina?

02:09.229 --> 02:11.790
[men shouting]

02:12.790 --> 02:14.758
Christina: Mark!

02:14.760 --> 02:17.798
Christina, landon.
You ok?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.723
Yeah.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.062
[indistinct chatter]

03:04.280 --> 03:06.647
Call if
anything happens.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.799
Thanks.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.447
[knock knock]

03:09.450 --> 03:11.145
The richards are
on their way up.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.379
Great.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.142
Former skinhead
and his latina wife

03:14.160 --> 03:15.480
Are being stalked
by skinheads.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.049
Sounds like a woman
who likes a project.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.552
I will talk to the wife, you interview
the husband. We'll compare later.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.790
Why? You don't think the
guy's completely reformed?

03:21.800 --> 03:24.895
I just want her perspective
free of her husband.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.824
You tell us if
he's reformed, jack.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.960
Yes, but it's a process and
requires a lot of rewiring.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.005
I find that it's
two steps forward.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.205
And 10 steps back.

03:36.210 --> 03:39.874
Thanks, beth.
Good luck.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.041
Jack, voice-over:
This group of skinheads

03:41.050 --> 03:42.347
Is targeting you
because of your

03:42.350 --> 03:43.749
Past affiliations
with them?

03:43.750 --> 03:45.980
I don't know these guys.
They're local.

03:45.990 --> 03:48.914
I was with a group out
in riverside years ago,

03:48.920 --> 03:50.684
But they must know
that I left the movement,

03:50.690 --> 03:53.057
And in their book,
that makes me as bad

03:53.060 --> 03:54.824
Or worse
than any minority.

03:54.830 --> 03:55.991
How do you think
they found you?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.822
I don't know.
I left that life behind

03:58.830 --> 04:00.491
A long time ago.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.992
I changed my name,
I moved out here,

04:03.010 --> 04:05.001
Started over.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.206
Getting them
lasered off.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.076
21 sessions and counting,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.616
And it hurts
like a bitch.

04:14.620 --> 04:20.012
The eighth letter
of the alphabet is "h."

04:20.019 --> 04:21.112
Heil hitter.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.781
Look. Why are we being
questioned separately?

04:22.790 --> 04:24.212
Isn't that something
you guys do to suspects?

04:24.230 --> 04:26.619
It's how we get the
clearest understanding

04:26.630 --> 04:30.521
Mark said that they've been
following him around for 3 weeks,

04:30.530 --> 04:32.089
But they've never
come to our home

04:32.100 --> 04:33.920
Or our
neighborhood before.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.760
Mark said we'd
be safe.

04:35.770 --> 04:36.862
Often, groups are
bound by code.

04:36.870 --> 04:39.635
There are certain
boundaries gangs won't cross.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.801
That's what mark said,

04:40.810 --> 04:43.529
But they have
crossed them.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.072
Janice: What is it?

04:46.080 --> 04:47.275
Ex-neo-nazi
skinhead,

04:47.280 --> 04:49.442
Claims he's being
gang stalked.

04:49.450 --> 04:51.544
Why the attitude?

04:51.550 --> 04:54.611
You ever mess
with these guys?

04:54.620 --> 04:56.952
They attacked my brother
back in high school

04:56.960 --> 04:58.485
Just for looking
in their direction.

04:58.490 --> 04:59.980
Which brother,
the tall one

05:00.000 --> 05:02.094
Or the younger one
with the cute butt?

05:02.100 --> 05:03.397
Younger one.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.959
There's nothing cute
about him.

05:04.970 --> 05:08.463
Don't worry.
Your butt's cute, too.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.893
Jack: So why are
these guys harassing you?

05:10.910 --> 05:12.560
Do they feel
betrayed by you?

05:12.570 --> 05:13.901
Well, yeah.
They have to,

05:13.910 --> 05:16.800
Or they'll have to face the
truth of who they really are.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.643
You spend all your time
pissed off, hating people

05:19.650 --> 05:22.676
Because of stuff
you've been told

05:22.690 --> 05:24.010
Or because things
just suck

05:24.020 --> 05:26.443
And it's got to be
someone else's fault.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.916
What's changed in you?

05:27.920 --> 05:30.412
I met christina.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.990
How much has he told
you about his past?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.458
He's honest.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.258
What he told me
didn't fit with the guy

05:37.270 --> 05:38.499
That I fell
in love with.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.765
He had a lot of issues
with his father.

05:41.770 --> 05:45.638
But I knew that
it could be unlearned.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.132
He really wants to be
a better man,

05:48.140 --> 05:52.008
And he's proving to me
every day that he's changed,

05:52.010 --> 05:57.141
But I can tell that this
is taking a toll on him.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.380
Can you help us?

06:00.660 --> 06:03.516
Mark: Who's she talking
to in there?

06:03.530 --> 06:06.056
My boss
lieutenant davis.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.027
She's asian.

06:07.030 --> 06:10.455
Viethamese american.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.892
Is that a problem?

06:11.900 --> 06:12.992
Could be.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.890
I don't think many people
are gonna be too sympathetic

06:15.900 --> 06:19.006
To who I was,
where I been.

06:19.010 --> 06:22.640
You can't expect people to
be ok with your past, mark.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.075
Honestly, I'm not,
but that doesn't mean

06:25.080 --> 06:28.710
I won't do everything I can
to help you and your family.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.518
- Janice: Neo-nazis
in southern california run

06:30.520 --> 06:33.581
The gamut from loosely
organized skinhead groups--

06:33.590 --> 06:36.309
Assaults, hate crimes,
targeting law enforcement--

06:36.330 --> 06:39.584
To organized crime
to political organizations

06:39.600 --> 06:41.159
That claim to be
nonviolent.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.094
Skinheads have their roots
in the aryan nation,

06:43.100 --> 06:45.228
Which started out of the
california prison system,

06:45.230 --> 06:47.062
Aka the harvard
for skinheads,

06:47.070 --> 06:51.029
But today, they're highly
organized, coordinated, educated.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.701
Wise to the fact that
they're in the minority.

06:52.710 --> 06:55.429
They're more apt to
subvert and harass

06:55.440 --> 06:57.078
Than brazenly attack
and harm.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.106
You might say skinheads
are professional stalkers.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.349
They know how to bend
the law without breaking it.

07:01.350 --> 07:03.773
Ben: They grow their
ranks by recruiting young,

07:03.790 --> 07:05.087
Usually troubled teens.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.285
Beth: Give a loner
something to believe in,

07:06.290 --> 07:07.940
A community to be
a part of,

07:07.960 --> 07:09.689
It's a powerful thing.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.714
I mean, look
at this guy.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.186
Jack: I know he was
a white supremacist

07:12.190 --> 07:13.885
And a racist,
disgusting,

07:13.900 --> 07:17.530
But he's gone to great
length to change his life.

07:17.530 --> 07:21.899
You really think that kind of
embedded bigotry goes away?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.368
I believe him.

07:23.370 --> 07:24.189
Shocker.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.030
Ben, start with
gangs and narcotics.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.577
Janice, pull up all the
hate crimes in the last year.

07:28.580 --> 07:29.979
I want a list
of skinhead groups,

07:29.980 --> 07:31.607
Affiliations,
names, addresses.

07:31.610 --> 07:34.819
Let's find out
who's doing this.

[door opens]

[cartoon sounds on tv]

08:26.370 --> 08:28.259
Dad?

08:28.270 --> 08:30.637
Oh. Hey. You ok?

08:30.640 --> 08:31.766
I couldn't sleep.

08:31.770 --> 08:34.636
I wanted to
watch tv.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.678
Well, now let me
tell you what.

08:38.380 --> 08:41.918
You want to sleep
with your mom and me?

08:45.050 --> 08:49.510
Why don't you go crawl
in bed with your mom, ok?

08:54.830 --> 08:56.798
[creak]

09:04.640 --> 09:07.701
[phone ringing]

09:09.580 --> 09:13.005
Man: It's been
a long time, mark.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.148
You look good.

09:15.150 --> 09:17.812
Who's this?

09:17.820 --> 09:18.912
A friend.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.149
You think
you're safe?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.879
We can get to you
whenever we want.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.358
Yeah? Well, I've already
called the cops.

09:24.360 --> 09:28.558
They won't make it
in time to save your family.

09:29.330 --> 09:32.868
Mark, mark,
someone's outside.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.326
Honey, get away
from the window.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.990
Man: She moves,
she dies.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.504
Wait, wait,
don't move!

09:39.510 --> 09:43.674
Please. Don't do this.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.941
Your wife
or your half-breed kid.

09:47.950 --> 09:48.769
Dad!

09:48.780 --> 09:50.009
You choose.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.079
No! Just stop!

09:52.090 --> 09:55.458
Your life belongs
to me.

09:55.460 --> 09:56.712
Aah!

09:56.730 --> 09:58.459
Down, down!

09:59.930 --> 10:00.852
You ok?

10:00.860 --> 10:02.396
I'm ok.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.199
Landon? Landon.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.669
Are you all right?

10:18.150 --> 10:21.108
[indistinct chatter]

10:24.050 --> 10:25.882
Mark: His name's
chad hewitt.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.415
Chad hewitt. Ok.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.253
I know it was him.
That was his voice.

10:30.260 --> 10:31.455
Thought he was
still in prison.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.383
I'll have ben
run him down.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.459
We'll keep a presence
here today.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.723
We spoke to
your neighbors,

10:36.730 --> 10:37.925
Explained
the situation.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.329
Christina: What neighbors?

10:39.330 --> 10:40.491
They hate us now,

10:40.500 --> 10:44.232
Think I'm married
to a skinhead.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.436
This is what
stalkers do.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.636
They remove your
sense of safety.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.302
It's easier to terrorize you if
you're vulnerable and alone.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.471
They were gonna
kill us last night.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.939
But they didn't,
and that tells us volumes.

10:55.950 --> 10:58.112
They're not trying
to kill you,

10:58.120 --> 10:59.440
Or they would have.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.986
Not them. Him.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.413
One guy's
behind all of this.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.286
Chad hewitt did
11 years in corcoran,

11:06.290 --> 11:08.759
Released 8 months ago,
settled in the valley.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.921
Not much
of an online presence,

11:09.930 --> 11:11.420
But it looks like he
started his own group,

11:11.430 --> 11:14.923
The southern california
confederated socialists.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.362
A political
organization.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.259
Our self-reformed
skinhead is being stalked

11:18.270 --> 11:19.806
By a prison-reformed
skinhead.

11:19.810 --> 11:22.108
Let's check him out.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.975
How well do you
know chad?

11:24.980 --> 11:27.176
I recruited him.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.818
Guy was just a teenager
when I brought him in.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.710
Saved him
from some bullies.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.154
I taught him
how to fight,

11:35.160 --> 11:37.015
Gave him confidence.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.658
I taught him loyalty
and one truth

11:39.660 --> 11:41.697
Above anything else--

11:41.700 --> 11:45.523
You are nothing
without family.

11:46.870 --> 11:48.998
Ok. Got it.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.638
Ben and beth are
checking out chad hewitt.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.063
S.I1.D. Has the brick that
came through the window.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.502
They're tracing
the cell, which will

11:54.510 --> 11:55.807
Inevitably lead
to a burner

11:55.810 --> 11:58.472
Because these guys
are careful.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.845
What?

11:59.850 --> 12:03.150
Security cameras
on the neighbors' houses.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.845
What are the chances one
of them was actually working

12:04.850 --> 12:07.217
And caught the skinheads
on camera?

12:07.220 --> 12:08.483
[knock on door]

12:08.490 --> 12:10.379
[dog barking]

12:10.390 --> 12:12.950
[deadbolt clacks]

12:13.860 --> 12:14.850
Can I help you?

12:14.860 --> 12:16.692
Did you see or hear
or anything last night?

12:16.700 --> 12:18.589
Nope, and I'm not
gonna be the one

12:18.600 --> 12:19.863
Helping out
a skinhead.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.838
Are you referring
to mr. Richards?

12:21.840 --> 12:24.662
I never felt the need
for security cameras.

12:24.670 --> 12:26.536
This is
a good neighborhood,

12:26.540 --> 12:28.406
Or--or was.

12:28.410 --> 12:29.935
[dog barking]

12:29.950 --> 12:31.008
Shut up, marty.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.341
I'm here about
the security cameras

12:32.350 --> 12:33.442
On your property.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.248
Looks like one in particular
might have recorded

12:35.250 --> 12:36.513
Our crime scene
last night.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.682
I don't want to get caught in
skinhead on skinhead violence.

12:38.690 --> 12:39.942
I don't want them
coming for me.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.246
Bill: Look. T'll
look back through

12:41.260 --> 12:42.557
The footage myself
and let you know.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.380
As soon as possible,
if you would.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.779
I'd appreciate it.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.881
Look. I get your
hesitance--

12:47.900 --> 12:50.198
Go get a warrant,
and we'll talk.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.427
[dead bolt clacks]

12:56.540 --> 12:57.393
[horn honks]

12:57.410 --> 12:59.538
Not what I expected
of wannabe hitter.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.406
Well, his father died of
cancer and no other family.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.629
Chad inherited the
house and some money.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.448
Also owns a bike shop
in pacoima.

13:05.450 --> 13:08.044
[music playing]

13:08.050 --> 13:11.372
[indistinct chatter]

13:19.560 --> 13:22.860
Hey. It's
the police.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.059
Chad: You got
some bad intel.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.299
No skinheads
around here.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.268
Full heads of hair
everywhere I look.

13:30.270 --> 13:33.160
You're the leader of a white
supremacist group, correct?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.238
White separatists.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.469
There's
a difference.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.005
How does one separate
the races in ILA., sir?

13:37.010 --> 13:38.978
Beth: You're not
a skinhead. Got it.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.176
We're investigating you
on suspicion

13:41.180 --> 13:43.012
Of stalking mark richards.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.647
Did you call him
last night?

13:44.650 --> 13:48.484
Hey. Go help
your mom. Go.

13:49.090 --> 13:50.854
That's my
girlfriend's kid.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.521
He's not used
to unfriendlies.

13:52.530 --> 13:54.988
The richards family has
been targeted by skinheads.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.991
You clearly associate
with them.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.368
We're a nonviolent
political organization.

14:00.370 --> 14:02.589
Most of us have
families, kids.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.637
We--we just want a
better world for them.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.836
When was the last time
you saw mark richards?

14:06.840 --> 14:08.001
You mean mark evans?

14:08.010 --> 14:11.036
Changing your name
doesn't change who you are.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.849
Beth: So you know who
we're referring to.

14:13.850 --> 14:16.649
Yeah. Mark recruited
me out of high school

14:16.650 --> 14:18.277
Now he was
a skinhead.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.611
He taught me
about the world,

14:20.620 --> 14:24.488
He really wanted to change
society and its wrongs,

14:24.490 --> 14:26.788
And I believed that
we could do it.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.553
I was his
proud soldier.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.959
He's moved on.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.723
Maybe you should, too.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.038
Is that
why you're here,

14:36.040 --> 14:40.807
To give me that
pearl of wisdom?

14:40.810 --> 14:42.835
Look. I've moved on.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.638
Mark sidelined
my life.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.402
I went to prison
because of him.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.139
You went to prison because
you put a man in a coma.

14:48.150 --> 14:50.346
Look. I don't appreciate
you coming here,

14:50.350 --> 14:52.341
Guests in my home,
waving your guns

14:52.350 --> 14:54.216
And your badges
around the kids

14:54.220 --> 14:55.585
And leering
in judgment

14:55.590 --> 14:57.479
Of the very people
who pay your salaries.

14:57.490 --> 15:01.529
We'd be happy to
discuss this downtown.

15:01.530 --> 15:05.421
- _You two sit in judgment
of me and my beliefs,

15:05.430 --> 15:07.524
But they come
with integrity.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.200
Do yours?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.690
So you're
a good skinhead?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.691
Hey. Watch it!

15:11.710 --> 15:13.360
That word--

15:13.380 --> 15:17.339
These kids already get
enough torment for their beliefs,

15:17.350 --> 15:18.579
And now they have
to hear that word

15:18.580 --> 15:24.576
From the colorful lapd
at their own barbecue?

15:24.590 --> 15:27.082
For instance, detective,
if I were to tell you

15:27.090 --> 15:29.559
To go back to where
you came from--

15:29.560 --> 15:33.451
What, mexico,
china--

15:33.460 --> 15:35.758
Would that hurt
your feelings?

15:35.760 --> 15:38.252
So what gives you
the right to judge me

15:38.270 --> 15:39.920
And what I
stand for?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.034
That tattoo
on your neck does, sir.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.293
It tells me you stand
for hatred and bigotry

15:44.310 --> 15:46.802
And believe in a world
of separation.

15:46.810 --> 15:47.959
I'm ok with judging that.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.939
Ben. Mr. Hewitt,
this is your only warning.

15:51.950 --> 15:55.079
Stay away from mark
and his family.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.878
Let's go.

16:04.730 --> 16:05.720
[door slams]

16:05.730 --> 16:07.653
I let you out of the
bullpen for 5 minutes...

16:07.660 --> 16:11.654
I'm sorry. Was I
too much back there?

16:11.670 --> 16:13.661
No. No, you were good.

16:13.670 --> 16:14.626
Janice: Do you
believe him?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.734
He's all abandonment
issues wrapped up

16:16.740 --> 16:18.299
In carefully
concealed rage.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.630
I don't think this is
about the group

16:19.640 --> 16:21.734
Wanting revenge on mark
because he left.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.299
This is about chad
and mark.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.608
Chad's clearly got
daddy issues.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.748
Who doesn't?

16:26.750 --> 16:28.343
He saw mark
as af father figure,

16:28.350 --> 16:30.170
Impossible
bond to break.

16:30.190 --> 16:30.941
Not impossible.

16:30.950 --> 16:33.840
"You're nothing
without family."

16:33.860 --> 16:36.352
What?

16:36.360 --> 16:38.351
Something mark said.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.452
He left
the brotherhood,

16:39.460 --> 16:40.586
He marries
outside his race,

16:40.600 --> 16:41.681
He rejects
everything

16:41.700 --> 16:43.350
He taught chad
to believe in.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.020
It's like
dr. Frankenstein

16:45.030 --> 16:45.861
Turning his back

16:45.870 --> 16:47.292
On the monster
he created.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.997
And what does
the monster want?

16:50.010 --> 16:51.262
Beth: He's a resentful
stalker.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.204
He feels rejected,
but more than that.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.769
He feels
personally wronged.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.509
Discovering what mark
did with his life

16:56.510 --> 16:57.773
Must have been
a real blow for chad.

16:57.780 --> 17:00.772
It's probably why he started
the group in the first place.

17:00.780 --> 17:01.906
Now he wants to use
that army

17:01.920 --> 17:03.775
To destroy the life that
mark created for himself.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.680
The monster wants mark
to return to the brotherhood.

17:06.690 --> 17:09.352
He doesn't believe
he's reformed.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.522
Guys, submit an
emergency protective order

17:12.530 --> 17:14.782
Against chad
to the judge today.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.790
I want him served tonight.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.223
So he can't come within
100 yards of them.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.324
What about the rest
of his gang?

17:20.339 --> 17:21.522
Hey, beth.
You got a sec?

17:21.540 --> 17:25.864
Yeah. Detective wilkes,
come on in.

17:25.869 --> 17:28.840
I, uh, understand
you paid a visit

17:28.840 --> 17:30.399
To chad hewitt
this morning.

17:30.410 --> 17:32.401
That's right.
How'd you know that?

17:32.410 --> 17:33.707
Well, I'm part
of a task force

17:33.720 --> 17:35.006
That's been
surveilling him

17:35.020 --> 17:36.010
For a couple
of months now.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.840
Hewitt's been building
a group of neo-nazis

17:37.850 --> 17:39.739
In the valley
successfully.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.309
He keeps the violent
members compartmentalized

17:41.320 --> 17:43.914
From the political, but,
yeah, he's building an army,

17:43.930 --> 17:45.056
And we want to
take it down.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.482
He's using that army
to stalk a family.

17:46.490 --> 17:47.855
We're trying to
protect them.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.658
The task force is
trying to protect

17:49.660 --> 17:50.422
An entire community.

17:50.430 --> 17:51.693
Isn't your guy
a skinhead anyway?

17:51.700 --> 17:54.089
He's reformed.
He's not that guy anymore.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.898
Well, people only
change so much,

17:55.900 --> 17:58.733
Don't you think,
jack?

17:59.670 --> 18:01.536
Are you telling us
to stay away from chad?

18:01.540 --> 18:03.736
I don't think this has
to become adversarial.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.740
Then stay out of it.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.502
I'm trying to cut the
head off this beast,

18:06.510 --> 18:08.103
Not get hewitt
on some misdemeanor

18:08.120 --> 18:10.043
So he can just get
back out in 6 months,

18:10.050 --> 18:11.779
And if you spook
him now,

18:11.790 --> 18:13.019
He may pull back
from his plans.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.715
Well, good because
that's what we do here,

18:14.720 --> 18:18.884
And hopefully we stop
him from killing someone.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.585
Anything else?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.523
Always a pleasure.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.134
Christina: I had to get
out of the neighborhood.

18:29.140 --> 18:31.131
I was starting to feel
all cooped up,

18:31.140 --> 18:33.563
So I just brought him
to the playground.

18:33.580 --> 18:39.405
Well, he seems fine. I mean,
he's already made a few friends.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.707
I don't know.
I don't know.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.475
I might talk to my sister,
see if we can stay with her.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.380
Mark wants us to. Yeah.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.381
Landon: I got it!

18:57.330 --> 19:00.163
Hey. You looking
for this, little guy?

19:00.170 --> 19:03.834
Christina: Yeah. I'm trying
to figure out what to do.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.569
Yeah.

19:10.740 --> 19:16.418
Um, I got to call
you back, ok? Ok.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.149
Landon?

19:19.790 --> 19:21.940
Landon?

19:21.960 --> 19:23.655
Landon?

19:26.990 --> 19:29.652
My dad has one
of those.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.799
He says it means
a bad thing.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.462
Aw, it's not bad.

19:34.470 --> 19:38.338
It's a symbol of
strength and power

19:38.340 --> 19:40.604
Just like your dad.

19:42.010 --> 19:45.776
Ah. Don't be
in such a hurry, buddy.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.874
Do you like motorcycles?

19:47.880 --> 19:49.279
Because, you know, if you
want to ride a motorcycle,

19:49.280 --> 19:52.716
You should tell your
dad to come see me.

19:53.690 --> 19:56.853
Landon, get over here!

19:58.030 --> 20:01.352
You got
a brave boy there.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.498
What do you want?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.821
I was just keeping
him company.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.867
He was here
all alone.

20:06.870 --> 20:09.191
Society is full
of unsavory people.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.637
As a mother, you
should be more careful.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.506
Leave us alone.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.638
It was nice
to meet you.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.607
You, too, buddy.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.860
If he comes near you or
your family, we can arrest him.

20:33.860 --> 20:34.930
I want to talk
to chad.

20:34.930 --> 20:36.489
Look. Maybe he and 1
can just hash this out.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.265
Nothing good can come
from that meeting, mark.

20:39.270 --> 20:40.328
Listen. He wants me.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.230
And contacting him would
be tacit encouragement.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.265
He'll only keep coming
after you and your family.

20:45.270 --> 20:48.035
No, no, no. He's using
my family to get at me.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.829
You need to show a
little patience here, sir.

20:51.850 --> 20:55.912
This is detective wilkes
from robbery homicide.

20:55.920 --> 20:56.716
Homicide?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.449
I know how difficult
this is.

20:58.450 --> 21:00.418
Stalking victims can
often find themselves

21:00.420 --> 21:02.184
In a traumatic cycle
where they start to

21:02.190 --> 21:03.453
Anticipate
the next staking event.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.849
The experience,
it's not unlike ptsd.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.589
It can lead
to irrational acts.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.227
I'm not irrational.

21:09.230 --> 21:11.756
I just don't like sitting
around doing nothing.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.522
Trent: Well, there's
something that you can do.

21:13.530 --> 21:15.419
Lapd has been
investigating chad,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.295
But there's still a lot we
don't know about him,

21:17.310 --> 21:19.062
His group,
how they operate.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.732
You could help us put chad
away for a very long time.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.107
Look. I do that,
I'm marked for life,

21:24.110 --> 21:27.045
Not just by chad but by
every skinhead out there.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.245
You created
this problem.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.945
There's something that
you can do about it.

21:29.950 --> 21:31.270
You think I
deserve this.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.314
No one thinks that.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.742
Uh, yeah, I do.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.410
It is your fault,
and you can do

21:35.420 --> 21:36.285
Something to fix it.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.917
I'm offering you
a solution here, mark.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.080
Detective wilkes,
enough.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.127
Mark.

21:42.130 --> 21:44.121
You got to trust us.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.439
Frank let tim
come over and play.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.977
I want you guys to
head over to your sister's.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.835
All right? I packed up
some of his stuff.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.648
I'm not leaving you
here alone.

22:00.650 --> 22:03.620
We're safer
if we're together.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.349
It's not coming off.

22:05.350 --> 22:08.183
We just need
a screwdriver.

22:08.190 --> 22:11.057
I'm not supposed
to go in there.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.796
Please just do this
for me, all right?

22:15.800 --> 22:18.258
I need to know that
you and landon are safe.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.693
Being around me
right now,

22:20.700 --> 22:22.668
It isn't safe.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.009
[sighs]

22:27.440 --> 22:29.374
Here we go.

22:32.510 --> 22:34.342
There has to be a
screwdriver in here.

22:34.350 --> 22:38.048
Hurry before my dad
sees you.

22:42.190 --> 22:43.351
That's weird.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.613
Put it back,
and let's go ask my dad.

22:45.630 --> 22:47.985
I'm going to
get in trouble.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.322
Hey. Here's one.

22:51.330 --> 22:53.890
[door creaking]

22:53.900 --> 22:58.064
Then he will just follow me
to my sister's house, won't he?

22:58.070 --> 22:58.889
Then what?

22:58.910 --> 23:00.162
I don't know.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.240
[explosion]

23:01.240 --> 23:02.401
Landon!

23:02.410 --> 23:05.038
Landon!
Landon!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.347
Landon!

23:06.350 --> 23:07.203
Are you ok?

23:07.220 --> 23:09.416
Tim, tim,
are you all right?

23:09.420 --> 23:11.172
All right. Let's go.
Everybody inside.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.716
Come on, come on.

23:29.540 --> 23:32.430
[clatter]

23:41.050 --> 23:42.814
[thump]

23:51.460 --> 23:53.588
Hello?

24:23.390 --> 24:24.414
Unh!

24:24.430 --> 24:26.728
[grunting]

24:26.730 --> 24:29.620
[spits]

24:29.630 --> 24:32.463
Mark evans. Heh.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.996
Hey. I just
met your son.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.461
Ugh.

24:37.470 --> 24:40.269
Ha ha ha!

24:40.270 --> 24:43.934
See, I wondered
if you'd changed,

24:43.950 --> 24:45.770
But I knew
you hadn't.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.646
Leave my family
alone.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.573
Agh!

24:51.350 --> 24:52.579
There you are.

24:52.590 --> 24:55.150
I knew you were
in there.

24:59.860 --> 25:02.727
Leave my family
alone.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.637
Mark went after chad
at his shop,

25:14.640 --> 25:16.369
Turned himself in
about an hour ago.

25:16.380 --> 25:17.836
What do we know
about the explosive?

25:17.850 --> 25:20.000
Bomb squad said it was
homemade, amateur hour.

25:20.010 --> 25:21.273
Trigger device
was faulty.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.442
Only reason no one was
seriously injured or killed.

25:23.450 --> 25:26.044
Landon suffered a
few shallow lacerations.

25:26.050 --> 25:29.554
Neighbor's kid's ok.
They're both shaken up.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.312
They were really lucky.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.049
Mark: He planted
a bomb in my backyard.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.653
He could have killed
my son and his friend.

25:35.660 --> 25:39.790
Mark, we can't prove that chad
had anything to do with that device.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.495
I don't care
what you can prove.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.195
You could be brought up
on assault charges.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.862
Do you know
what that means?

25:45.870 --> 25:47.702
Jail time.

25:47.710 --> 25:50.577
Was cold cocking him
worth it?

25:52.510 --> 25:54.342
I talked to christina.

25:54.350 --> 25:57.513
She's worried about you.

25:57.520 --> 26:01.218
Told her to take landon
over to her sister's.

26:01.220 --> 26:05.009
This isn't gonna end
until one of us is dead.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.089
It's just how
we operate.

26:07.090 --> 26:08.888
We?

26:08.900 --> 26:12.052
It's the brotherhood's
way.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.595
This is going to end
when we end it,

26:13.600 --> 26:15.762
But you need to be
smart, mark.

26:15.770 --> 26:18.660
Your family's
depending on you.

26:22.110 --> 26:23.908
Is chad hewitt
gonna press charges?

26:23.910 --> 26:26.208
He said he didn't
want mark to go to jail

26:26.210 --> 26:28.542
And it was good to see
his old buddy.

26:28.550 --> 26:30.040
It's like he's
protecting him.

26:30.050 --> 26:31.370
He wants mark to come
back to the brotherhood.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.949
Mark's attack validated
his stalking.

26:32.950 --> 26:35.681
It's exactly what
he wanted.

26:35.690 --> 26:37.112
So you're talking
to me.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.111
That's a good thing.

26:39.130 --> 26:40.620
I'm doing my job.

26:40.630 --> 26:42.450
If you can keep it
professional,

26:42.460 --> 26:43.928
I can keep it
professional.

26:43.930 --> 26:44.749
Tell that to trent.

26:44.770 --> 26:45.965
I'm not going
there, jack.

26:45.970 --> 26:49.861
But you're not kicking
me out of |.A. Either.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.065
Thank you.

26:51.070 --> 26:51.969
For what?

26:51.970 --> 26:54.302
Letting me stay.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.111
Beth: We know that chad's
isolated mark

27:06.120 --> 27:07.485
And intimidated
his family,

27:07.490 --> 27:08.616
But he's been
very careful.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.315
He's acted
within the law,

27:10.320 --> 27:11.412
Doesn't leave
any evidence,

27:11.430 --> 27:12.625
And he's stalked
by proxy.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.724
Booby-trapping
mark's house,

27:14.730 --> 27:16.459
That seems
different to me.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.053
It's an escalation?

27:18.070 --> 27:21.119
Ben: Hey. The warrant for the
neighbor's surveillance video

27:21.140 --> 27:22.426
Finally went
through.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.738
We've got skinheads.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.469
Can't really make out
any faces.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.074
But there's this.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.343
'We have
a license plate.

27:35.350 --> 27:38.547
The car belongs
to chad hewitt.

27:39.650 --> 27:42.085
Trent: S.1.D. Just
finished searching his truck.

27:42.090 --> 27:46.288
No weapons, no lasers,
no evidence against chad.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.180
But we have his truck
at the scene.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.020
Ben: Two skinheads
just turned themselves in.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.589
They say they were
driving chad's truck

27:52.600 --> 27:54.261
And claim they alone
are responsible

27:54.270 --> 27:55.419
For the attack
on the richards.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.692
Trent: You guys
are blowing it.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.134
You have no case
against this guy.

27:58.140 --> 28:01.667
You realize the stakes of
just bringing him in here?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.774
I'll break him.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.214
[door opens]

28:14.350 --> 28:17.718
You realize you don't
have anything to hold me on.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.153
We're just talking,
a civil chat.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.049
Would you like
your lawyer present?

28:22.060 --> 28:24.597
I'm fine.

28:28.230 --> 28:33.509
Tell me, how'd you get
into this life?

28:33.510 --> 28:36.377
Mark was very persuasive.

28:36.380 --> 28:39.133
He showed a kid who got
his ass kicked every other day

28:39.150 --> 28:40.379
What real power was.

28:40.380 --> 28:43.179
Shaped me into the man
I am today.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.319
Seems to me like
you still respect him,

28:45.320 --> 28:47.516
Like you still want him
a part of your gang.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.387
I never turn my back
on family.

28:50.390 --> 28:51.755
His blood is my blood.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.159
Then why'd you try
to kill him?

28:53.160 --> 28:54.025
I didn't.

28:54.030 --> 28:55.327
If mark would have
found that bomb,

28:55.330 --> 28:56.320
He could have
been Killed,

28:56.330 --> 28:58.253
And then you would have
lost your mentor.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.069
A bomb is the tool
of a coward.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.732
I have nothing to hide.

29:03.740 --> 29:06.107
I have nothing
to run from.

29:06.110 --> 29:08.863
Mark completely rejected
everything he taught you.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.439
That didn't create
a doubt in your mind

29:10.440 --> 29:14.240
That the power he gave you
was nothing but air?

29:14.250 --> 29:15.376
Never!

29:15.380 --> 29:18.213
When I'm surrounded
by my pureblood family,

29:18.220 --> 29:19.585
I know it's real.

29:19.590 --> 29:22.287
It wasn't real
to mark.

29:22.290 --> 29:27.182
You went to prison,
and he left you behind.

29:27.190 --> 29:29.124
[huffs]

29:29.130 --> 29:31.292
I know what
you're doing.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.190
It's what you
subraces try to do--

29:34.200 --> 29:36.532
- Turn us
against each other.

29:36.540 --> 29:39.032
Trent: He's not
gonna break.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.735
I don't know
about that.

29:40.740 --> 29:43.937
Beth: All it took
was the love of a woman,

29:43.940 --> 29:46.204
And you meant
nothing to him.

29:46.210 --> 29:48.804
He abandoned you to be
with one of those subraces

29:48.820 --> 29:49.969
You hate so much.

29:49.980 --> 29:52.745
That's all it took.

29:52.750 --> 29:56.209
Do you know what I see
when I look at you?

29:56.220 --> 29:58.314
I see that scared little
kid who got his ass kicked

29:58.330 --> 30:01.425
Every day at school, and
without mark there to protect him,

30:01.430 --> 30:02.386
When push came
to shove,

30:02.400 --> 30:04.220
He turned right back
into that little kid.

30:04.230 --> 30:05.720
You're
wrong!

30:05.730 --> 30:08.597
I am stronger
than he ever was,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.238
And I'm sure as hell
smarter

30:10.240 --> 30:12.368
Than some hab.

30:16.340 --> 30:19.139
Are we done here?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.741
Done.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.685
Back to square one.

30:44.170 --> 30:45.763
Cabeza rapada.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.101
What did you say
to me, boy?

30:47.110 --> 30:49.932
You should learn spanish if
you're gonna live in los angeles.

30:49.940 --> 30:53.843
I'm gonna Kkill your
mexican ass. You're dead!

30:53.850 --> 30:55.978
We need backup now.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.175
Here you go. Yeah.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.820
Beth: You're under arrest
for making a threat

30:59.820 --> 31:01.288
Against a police officer.

31:01.290 --> 31:02.519
Get him out of here.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.058
Let's go!
This way.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.019
Jack: Criminal threat
gets him 4 years.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.896
All you've done is
bought your victim

31:10.900 --> 31:12.220
A little breathing room.

31:12.230 --> 31:13.391
There's
something else.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.892
I think chad was telling
the truth about the bomb.

31:15.900 --> 31:16.890
He didn't set it.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.334
Then it was one
of his skinheads.

31:18.340 --> 31:19.660
No. Chad wouldn't
have authorized that.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.229
He was contemptuous
about the bomb,

31:21.240 --> 31:22.230
Like it was
beneath him.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.402
Right. He doesn't
want to kill mark.

31:24.410 --> 31:25.400
He wants him back.

31:25.410 --> 31:26.206
Exactly.

31:26.210 --> 31:29.373
The neighbors' security
cameras didn't catch anyone.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.417
The bomb was planted by
someone who knew how to get

31:31.420 --> 31:35.243
Someone who knew about those
cameras in the neighborhood,

31:35.260 --> 31:37.410
How to avoid them.

31:37.420 --> 31:39.184
So it was someone
from the neighborhood.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.419
Everyone thought
they knew mark.

31:40.430 --> 31:43.252
Maybe finding out about
mark's past triggered something.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.558
Ben, pull janice. We need
to focus on the neighbors,

31:45.570 --> 31:48.267
Anyone with priors or a
history of mental illness.

31:48.270 --> 31:49.999
Jack, go get mark,
get him out of there.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.365
I'll go with him,

31:51.370 --> 31:53.031
No. Not necessary.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.508
Come on, jack.
It will give us

31:54.510 --> 31:55.602
An opportunity
to bond.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.931
I'm good.
Come on.

32:00.750 --> 32:03.276
Yeah. Where is it?

32:03.280 --> 32:04.441
Ok. I'll grab it.

32:04.450 --> 32:07.613
Yeah. All right.
I'll see you soon.

32:07.620 --> 32:11.250
I love you, too,
sweetheart. Bye.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.742
Unh!

33:34.340 --> 33:37.332
[tires squeal]

33:37.340 --> 33:40.344
[cell phone vibrating]

33:40.350 --> 33:43.376
I'll get mark.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.176
Larsen.

33:44.180 --> 33:44.976
Do you have mark?

33:44.990 --> 33:46.480
Just landed.
What do you got?

experiencing

34:02.400 --> 34:03.538
A psychotic break,
jack.

He's no better
than me!

36:48.540 --> 36:50.030
Get off him.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.031

36:52.040 --> 36:54.304
He deserves to die.

39:35.170 --> 39:39.732

help put chad away for good.

39:39.740 --> 39:40.901
How's your wound?

39:40.910 --> 39:45.529
Fine. I got
pain pills and wine.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.144
That scares me.

39:55.720 --> 39:59.759
I know you and jack
have a past.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.719
You don't want to
talk about it, that's fine,

40:03.730 --> 40:07.360
But don't you
think ethan

40:07.370 --> 40:10.237
Has a right
to see his father?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.889
Did jack tell
you that?

40:12.910 --> 40:14.867
No.

40:14.880 --> 40:18.373
But it is true,
isn't it?

40:18.380 --> 40:21.077
Yeah, it's true.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.446
And it's complicated.
