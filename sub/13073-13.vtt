in this basket?

18:27.673 --> 18:31.076

with their searching cries.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.212
And then, out of the shadows,

18:33.278 --> 18:37.015
the Blargus came creeping out,
hungry!

18:37.082 --> 18:40.085

18:55.868 --> 18:57.236
Rooter?
- Um, um...

18:57.302 --> 18:59.705
{\an1}I need to just lay down
for a while.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.340
- Uh, right on.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.041
Kratz?
Piri Piri?

19:03.108 --> 19:06.211

19:06.278 --> 19:09.214
- Um...Fee?
Foo?

19:09.281 --> 19:10.782

Can you see me?

19:10.849 --> 19:12.084
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?

19:12.150 --> 19:14.786
- Oh, my gosh!
I went too far!

to warm hearts

[all gasp]

19:34.006 --> 19:35.407
We have to finish the story.

it's gonna end anyway.

19:38.277 --> 19:39.845
- Nothing matters.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.881

Are you there?

19:52.758 --> 19:55.627

19:55.694 --> 19:58.096
Uh, hey, guys.
How's it going?

19:58.163 --> 20:00.065
So, uh, I'm the Blargus.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.900
- Wait.
That's the Blargus?

20:01.967 --> 20:05.938
- Yeah, so, uh, I didn't mean
to freak you out earlier,

20:06.004 --> 20:08.774
but, um,
I hope you like my pool.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.509
And I have some snacks.

20:10.576 --> 20:13.512
{\an3}Uh, hey there.
Can you open this jar for me?

20:13.579 --> 20:15.447
It's kind of on there tight.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.616
- I don't know if I can.
I'm not the man I used to b--

20:17.683 --> 20:19.818
Oh, my gosh!
It popped right off!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.386
I got my strength back!

20:21.453 --> 20:23.789
{\an3}- Hey, guys,
help yourselves to my freezer.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.992
{\an3}It's full of every
frozen TV dinner ever made,

20:27.059 --> 20:28.894

Whaaaaa?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.798
What about cold French fries?

20:32.864 --> 20:34.399
Pizza without the sauce?

20:34.466 --> 20:37.135
- I have pizza with the sauce
and you can wipe it off.

20:37.202 --> 20:40.739
<i>Then, suddenly, the queen</i>
<i>of the horses appeared again.</i>

20:40.806 --> 20:43.375
- Hey, so, uh,
I was pretty dramatic before,

20:43.442 --> 20:45.410
but I grew up,
and now I see life

20:45.477 --> 20:47.112
as wondrous and exciting!

20:47.179 --> 20:49.247
I mean, look!
I got this juicer!

20:49.314 --> 20:51.350
So...that's pretty cool.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.753
- Um, that's amazing!

20:58.423 --> 21:01.927
both: Whoa! Whoa!

21:01.994 --> 21:05.230
{\an3}- Now you're fused together
into a two-headed sea monster.

21:05.297 --> 21:06.531
both: Whoa!

21:06.598 --> 21:08.967
{\an1}- Yay! Now we can poke
each other's eyes.

21:09.034 --> 21:12.104
{\an3}- From that point on, the twins
were never apart again.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.238
- Sweet.

21:13.305 --> 21:14.973
- The Blargus hoped he'd made up

21:15.040 --> 21:17.042
for the damage he'd caused.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.145
{\an3}- Okay, guys, I just stormed off
and I'm kind of shocked

21:20.212 --> 21:21.947
that nobody came after me.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.216
{\an1}- Hey, you came back just
in time.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.851
The story just got fun.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.919
{\an3}- Hehe, cool. I wasn't
out there crying or anything.

21:27.986 --> 21:31.056
{\an3}Uh, so anyway, the Blargus has
a heated pool or something?

You're terrifying.
