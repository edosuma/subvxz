   Are you saying that
   thing's going to be

11:06.933 --> 11:08.900

       People are going to die.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.742
               A lot of people.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.385

  just a transmitted frequency.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.988
        It's high-powered.
        Like it has to be
        a really strong signal.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.890
         And that's causing
         it to shift?

11:31.892 --> 11:33.958
  No. I don't think
  it's just that.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.361
 Last night Argent said
 that it's getting smarter.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.631
 What if the Dread Doctors
 are trying to make
 the Beast grow faster?

11:39.633 --> 11:41.900
              With frequencies?
 No, by shifting.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.134
 The frequency
 is just the trigger.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.804
 The important part is when
 it shifts into the werewolf.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.573
                Like Peter.
           Right.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.874
 Yeah, when Peter
 was an Alpha,

11:49.876 --> 11:51.743
 he got stronger
 every full moon.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.579
 Eventually, the burns
 healed and he was
 back to normal.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.648
           So the Dread Doctors
           don't want to wait
           for the full moon.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.717
  They want the Beast to be
  as strong as possible,
  as fast as possible.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.018
            Because of Parrish.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.220
          So if this is
          happening tonight,

12:02.222 --> 12:03.354
             what are we
             going to do?

12:03.356 --> 12:04.956
             Uh, we've got
             one clue to go on.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.759
                 This came from
                 the hospital.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.863
              Whoever's lurking
              inside the Beast

12:11.865 --> 12:14.399
         is wearing a size 10
         of indeterminate make.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.834
                Indeterminate?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.168
           Means, it's
           a partial print.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.336
          Basically, it was all
          we were able to get

12:18.338 --> 12:20.739
      considering all the fire,
      blood and carnage.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.440
     How many size 10s
     are out there?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.075
        Only one with Parrish's
        blood on the sole.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.445
 So are we going to try
 to get the game canceled?

12:27.447 --> 12:28.880
            No, no, we're
            going to play,

12:28.882 --> 12:30.381
        but we're just going to
        hope really hard

12:30.383 --> 12:32.083
      that it doesn't turn into
      a blood-soaked massacre.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.385
              Okay, but, um...

12:34.387 --> 12:36.755
        Aren't we kind of
        missing out on a chance
        to catch this thing?

12:36.757 --> 12:38.389
       We don't have the "who,"

12:38.391 --> 12:39.824
        but we have the "where"
        and the "when."

12:45.132 --> 12:46.631
  There's too many people.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.400
          And we still don't
          actually know if
          it's going to happen.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.669
 It just might end up being
 a regular lacrosse game.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.939
       It's possible, right?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.107
              That's absolutely

 it remembers a little more
 of who it used to be.
