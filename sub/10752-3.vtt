00:30.040 --> 00:31.955
Space.

00:31.964 --> 00:33.195
What is it?

00:33.204 --> 00:36.515
The simple answer is, we don't know.

00:36.524 --> 00:39.315
Or at least, we didn't know until now.

00:39.324 --> 00:41.155
Hello, I'm Douglas Reynholm.

00:41.164 --> 00:44.555
And I'm not a scientist, but I
do have a better understanding

00:44.564 --> 00:48.395
of what space is than any
scientist living today.

00:48.404 --> 00:51.755
Where did I gain these
insights? From this man.

00:51.764 --> 00:55.759
The founder of Spaceology,
Beth Gaga Shaggy, no relation

00:56.440 --> 00:59.075
to either Lady Gaga or Shaggy,

00:59.084 --> 01:01.715
is the founder of Spaceology.

01:01.724 --> 01:04.114
A religion, not a cult.

01:04.123 --> 01:06.155
In other words, when it comes to space,

01:06.164 --> 01:08.595
he's the man with his
head screwed on tight.

01:08.604 --> 01:12.599
This is what he told me when I
met him on holiday two weeks ago.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.719
Space is invisible mind dust
and stars are but wishes.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.995
I mean, think about that!

01:20.004 --> 01:22.955
That means every star you
can see in the night sky

01:22.964 --> 01:25.315
is a wish that has come true.

01:25.324 --> 01:27.035
And they've come true

01:27.044 --> 01:30.395
because of something he
calls Spacestar Ordering.

01:30.404 --> 01:34.399
Spacestar Ordering is based on
the twin scientific principles

01:35.000 --> 01:37.035
of star maths and wishy thinking.

01:37.044 --> 01:41.039
If you'd like to know more, there
are thousands of Spaceology centres

01:41.880 --> 01:43.515
all over the UK.

01:43.524 --> 01:45.795
If that doesn't convince you,

01:45.804 --> 01:49.799
well, then, maybe you just don't
deserve to get what you want.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.955
Wow. You're a genius, Ray!
Love the special effects!

01:54.964 --> 01:57.555
How did you do that thing
where I'm spinning around?

01:57.564 --> 02:01.195
Well, in that bit, you're
actually spinning around.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.835
I'm glad you like the website, Mr... Reynholm,
I did spend quite a lot of time on it.

02:04.844 --> 02:08.354
It's brilliant, and well
worth every penny of the 50.

02:08.364 --> 02:10.514
100...Didn't we say 100?

02:10.524 --> 02:13.275
I never would have agreed to that.

02:13.284 --> 02:17.275
Ah, Jen! Guess who wanted a
helicopter this time last week

02:17.284 --> 02:21.279
and now, thanks to
Spacestar Ordering, has one?

02:21.400 --> 02:22.875
You?

02:22.884 --> 02:26.879
I'll give you a clue
- it ain't these chaps!

02:27.880 --> 02:29.355
You?

02:29.364 --> 02:32.155
You're a sceptic, Jen. You
should be more like these.

02:32.164 --> 02:35.715
They can't get enough of
my Spacestar Ordering story.

02:35.724 --> 02:39.719
Yes, yes, I noticed you've been
coming down here a lot more often

02:39.800 --> 02:41.835
because of all the questions.

02:41.844 --> 02:45.515
So, Mr. Reynholm, how did the
cosmos grant you a helicopter?

02:45.524 --> 02:48.795
Well, I visualised the thing I wanted.

02:48.804 --> 02:52.555
In my case, it was a helicopter.
I drew a picture of the helicopter

02:52.564 --> 02:56.395
on a piece of paper, then I
stood with my back to space,

02:56.404 --> 03:00.195
threw the paper over my
shoulder and wished really hard.

03:00.204 --> 03:03.315
When you say that you stood
with your back to space...Yes.

03:03.324 --> 03:04.635
...how exactly did you achieve that?

03:04.644 --> 03:07.875
I waited till night time.

03:07.884 --> 03:09.715
Of course.

03:09.724 --> 03:12.635
Couple of days later,
bought myself a helicopter.

03:12.644 --> 03:14.755
Explain that one, if you can!

03:14.764 --> 03:18.515
I wish the cosmos would make it
slightly harder to find our office.

03:18.524 --> 03:20.835
Don't worry, Jen, you'll get your wish,

03:20.844 --> 03:24.839
just as I one day,
I'll get my robot hand.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.675
Scientific mind, believes
in Spacestar Ordering.

03:28.684 --> 03:32.679
Who's getting the robot hand first?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.315
Hey, you're still up for tonight, right?

03:37.324 --> 03:39.115
I'll go if Moss goes.

03:39.124 --> 03:43.119
Sorry, Jen. I find music
confusing and annoying.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.995
Roy invited me to a gig once.
I didn't really enjoy it.

03:46.004 --> 03:49.235
You went to the wrong address.
You went to a swimming pool.

03:49.244 --> 03:51.995
Are you sure it's not swimming pools

03:52.004 --> 03:55.715
that you find confusing and annoying?

03:55.724 --> 03:57.355
You're right.

03:57.364 --> 04:00.915
It's not music I hate, it's swimming!

04:00.924 --> 04:04.919
You know what? I will come, Roy.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.399
Where's Moss? I can't believe
he's missing out on this.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.599
Where are they?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.555
I'm going to have to
go dance at the front.

04:27.564 --> 04:29.995
Aren't you a bit old for the front?

04:30.004 --> 04:31.515
I'm 31!

04:31.524 --> 04:35.519
Good for you, mate!

04:44.440 --> 04:48.439
Careful! My foot!

04:48.840 --> 04:52.035
You chill out, man!

04:54.524 --> 04:58.519
Jesus!

05:22.120 --> 05:24.675
Get out of town! You hooked
up with someone from the band?

05:24.684 --> 05:25.715
Wow, who was it?

05:25.724 --> 05:26.595
Norman.

05:26.604 --> 05:28.835
Norman? Oh, he's the drummer, right?

05:28.844 --> 05:31.435
The keyboard player.

05:31.444 --> 05:34.435
The keyboard player?

05:34.444 --> 05:35.235
Okay.

05:35.244 --> 05:36.955
Okay. What?

05:36.964 --> 05:37.995
No, it's just...

05:38.004 --> 05:40.595
The keyboard player? Really?!

05:40.604 --> 05:41.835
Yeah. What?

05:41.844 --> 05:45.075
It's just he's a bit geeky, isn't
he? I didn't think he was your type.

05:45.084 --> 05:47.955
Jen's going out with a geek!

05:47.964 --> 05:50.795
Are you sure it's not just
because he's in a band?

05:50.804 --> 05:53.915
Yes. I really am that shallow, Roy!

05:53.924 --> 05:55.475
I know you are.

05:55.484 --> 05:57.435
Yeah, I'm that shallow.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.915
You are, though. I mean,
you really, really are.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.995
Look, I like him.

06:02.004 --> 06:05.999
He doesn't say a lot, he's more of
a thinker. I think he's really cool.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.595
It's because he's in a
band! Oh, flippin' hell.

06:09.604 --> 06:10.795
Is this your back again?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.315
When did mosh pits become so unruly?

06:13.324 --> 06:15.195
I told you, you should get a massage.

06:15.204 --> 06:17.555
Oh, I've never enjoyed having massages.

06:17.564 --> 06:20.435
I don't like being naked
in front of strangers,

06:20.444 --> 06:24.439
and I can never relax if I think
someone might play Norah Jones.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.995
Who wants to hear another
Spacestar Ordering success story?

06:29.004 --> 06:30.675
Oh, wait, wait! Yeah, yeah.

06:30.684 --> 06:33.235
Okay, okay.

06:33.244 --> 06:34.795
Go!

06:34.804 --> 06:38.799
Last week, I decided I wanted
to learn how to do tattoos.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.555
So, I did the business.

06:40.564 --> 06:42.475
Bought a book on tattoos, read it,

06:42.484 --> 06:45.155
and now I know how to do tattoos. Look!

06:45.164 --> 06:47.195
My helicopter!

06:47.204 --> 06:48.915
Oh, that's brilliant.

06:48.924 --> 06:49.895
Let me see it... Ow!

06:49.904 --> 06:52.755
What the bloody hell's
wrong with you?

06:52.764 --> 06:54.275
I have a really bad back.

06:54.284 --> 06:56.155
You should see a masseuse.

06:56.164 --> 06:58.795
Don't see a masseuse!

06:58.804 --> 07:02.799
They're the biggest
con of the 20th century.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.839
I had a bad back, and I cured it,
thanks to the techniques outlined

07:07.600 --> 07:11.599
in this groundbreaking expose
of the massage industry.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.715
Go like this.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.555
And push your back up.

07:22.564 --> 07:24.675
Oh, for fuuu...!

07:24.684 --> 07:27.035
That's worse! That's way worse.

07:27.044 --> 07:28.395
It's terrible, isn't it?

07:28.404 --> 07:30.275
You told me that would make it better!

07:30.284 --> 07:34.279
No, no, no! That's how I
originally injured my back.

07:41.064 --> 07:41.835
You all right?

07:41.844 --> 07:44.675
Yeah, feels so much better already!

07:44.684 --> 07:47.355
So that's why I ended up
joining the parachute regiment.

07:47.364 --> 07:50.035
Ah, yeah, the Paras.

07:50.044 --> 07:52.715
That's the one I would have joined.

07:52.724 --> 07:55.835
But you know, fear of heights...

07:55.844 --> 07:57.955
Were you in the army?

07:57.964 --> 08:01.959
No.

08:04.724 --> 08:07.875
Right, I have to do a bit
of work on your thighs.

08:07.884 --> 08:11.879
Hey, you dowhat you need to do.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.639
Did you see that ludicrous
display last night?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.475
What was Mancini thinking, eh?

08:25.484 --> 08:28.955
The thing about Arsenal is,
they always try and walk it in.

08:28.964 --> 08:30.315
Arsenal?

08:30.324 --> 08:32.355
Whoever we're talking about.

08:32.364 --> 08:34.395
Right...

08:34.404 --> 08:35.434
nearly done.

08:36.804 --> 08:40.799
Oh, thanks again, man, this
really does feel so much better.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.235
Right.

08:43.244 --> 08:44.635
Oh, yeah!

08:44.644 --> 08:48.639
There we are. All finished.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.919
* I love him I love
him, I love him so. *

09:06.400 --> 09:08.795
Goodness me!

09:08.804 --> 09:12.799
What-what-what would you
term what just happened there?

09:13.560 --> 09:16.235
Norman says my voice is extraordinary.

09:16.244 --> 09:19.955
He's right.

09:19.964 --> 09:21.875
This is it, you know.

09:21.884 --> 09:23.595
This is the guy.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.275
This is the big one.

09:25.284 --> 09:28.555
There's nothing about him I don't like.

09:28.564 --> 09:31.795
When he's asleep, he makes this sound...

09:31.804 --> 09:35.435
a lovely, little, gentle purr.

09:43.964 --> 09:47.959
Oh, this is a long song.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.155
You know, the last few
days has been indescribable.

09:52.164 --> 09:56.159
Good.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.715
Hi, Roy!

10:14.724 --> 10:16.395
Hi, Roy.

10:16.404 --> 10:19.395
What?

10:19.404 --> 10:21.995
You okay?

10:22.004 --> 10:24.355
What?

10:24.364 --> 10:28.359
Are you all right?

10:34.124 --> 10:37.195
Is your back still hurting?
Didn't you go to see the masseuse?

10:37.204 --> 10:40.195
Yes, I did.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.635
Did it help?

10:42.644 --> 10:44.675
No.

10:44.684 --> 10:46.595
Are you okay?

10:46.604 --> 10:49.875
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, fine.

10:49.884 --> 10:53.879
It's just you'vegot the same face
you have when you eat vegetables.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.319
Okay.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.915
Something happened.

11:05.924 --> 11:08.435
Something happened?

11:08.444 --> 11:12.439
Yes. When I was getting the
massage, the masseuse did something.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.879
Go on.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.119
Okay, I'm going to tell
you, but have to promise

11:24.160 --> 11:28.115
not to laugh at me, because this
whole thing has left me very shaken.

11:28.124 --> 11:32.119
- Okay. I promise I will not laugh.
- Okay.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.079
He kissed me on the arse.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.755
Sorry, I may have
misheard you there, Roy.

11:46.764 --> 11:48.915
What did you just say?

11:48.924 --> 11:51.355
I was enjoying the massage,

11:51.364 --> 11:54.475
everything had gone very, very well,

11:54.484 --> 11:58.479
but then at the end he just leaned down,

11:58.680 --> 12:02.679
and he gave me a big kiss on the arse.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.479
And you thought I'd find that funny?!

12:12.680 --> 12:14.835
Well, yeah, I suppose I did.

12:14.844 --> 12:18.555
On what planet would that be funny?

12:18.564 --> 12:21.635
Whereabouts on the arse did he kiss you?

12:21.644 --> 12:23.155
I don't know,

12:23.164 --> 12:26.915
just to the left of the...the
line that goes down the middle.

12:26.924 --> 12:28.595
The cleftal horizon.

12:28.604 --> 12:30.675
Is that what it's called?

12:30.684 --> 12:33.715
Yes, it is, but never mind
that, what happened next?

12:33.724 --> 12:37.555
Well,then I just got dressed and I left.

12:37.564 --> 12:40.995
Okay. Have you told Jen this?

12:41.004 --> 12:43.395
No, I was reallyafraid
she'd laugh at me.

12:43.404 --> 12:46.275
Do you think Jen's a monster?!

12:46.284 --> 12:48.635
She wouldn't laugh
- this man crossed the line!

12:48.644 --> 12:52.035
He is a member of the medical
profession. Roy, look at me.

12:52.044 --> 12:55.035
Look... at... me!

12:55.044 --> 12:59.039
There is nothing funny about this.

12:59.920 --> 13:03.515
I think he crossed the line.
I don't think it's funny.

13:03.524 --> 13:07.519
I mean, I was so relaxed, and then
that just tensed me right up again.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.875
My hands were like that for an hour.

13:11.884 --> 13:15.395
I couldn't get them in
to my pockets to pay him.

13:15.404 --> 13:17.355
You paid him?!

13:17.364 --> 13:21.315
Roy, I've got to tell you, I
think you've got grounds to sue.

13:21.324 --> 13:25.195
Really?

13:25.204 --> 13:26.635
What is that?!

13:26.644 --> 13:28.675
That's Jen.

13:28.684 --> 13:31.155
That's what she does now.

13:31.164 --> 13:33.715
You should tell her.
You should tell her.

13:33.724 --> 13:34.835
What?

13:34.844 --> 13:36.955
Listen to this.

13:36.964 --> 13:39.035
Jen, you know that I
went for that massage?

13:39.044 --> 13:41.875
Yeah. You are not going to believe this.

13:41.884 --> 13:45.115
The bloke who did it
kissed me on my arse.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.235
No, Jen, my masseuse
kissed me on my bum!

13:53.244 --> 13:56.195
My body went into spasms!

13:56.204 --> 13:59.315
My hands were like this for an hour!

13:59.324 --> 14:01.355
Stop it! You're killing me!

14:01.364 --> 14:05.359
You've got to spread
that kind of material out!

14:06.000 --> 14:08.675
I can't believe this!

14:08.684 --> 14:12.679
So what's the problem? I know!
He doesn't write, he doesn't call!

14:16.000 --> 14:18.875
What, did you think he was
coming on to you?I don't know!

14:18.884 --> 14:22.879
Maybe he's like the Michelangelo
of physical therapists

14:23.080 --> 14:26.315
and that was his signature.
Maybe he does it to everybody.

14:26.324 --> 14:30.075
Look, to be honest, I
don't care why he did it.

14:30.084 --> 14:32.715
All I know is that I was vulnerable.

14:32.724 --> 14:36.719
I was naked, and he
kissed me on my bottom.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.515
I'll tell you something, this is
not the last he has heard of me.

14:40.524 --> 14:43.755
As God is my witness, no
man shall ever have to be

14:43.764 --> 14:47.355
kissed on the bottom unexpectedly
because of this man ever again.

14:47.364 --> 14:51.359
Will you stop laughing?!

14:53.200 --> 14:56.195
This is the first time
I've left before you.

14:56.204 --> 14:59.755
We're looking up legal precedents
of Roy being kissed on the arse.

14:59.764 --> 15:03.115
Don't sue him, Roy.
You'll get on the news.

15:03.124 --> 15:05.075
Don't listen to her.
Everyone will laugh!

15:05.084 --> 15:08.555
No-one will laugh! Come on, help
us bring this monster to justice!

15:08.564 --> 15:12.559
I can't. The band are playing a new
song tonight, they want my opinion.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.700
You know to just say,
"It's great," right?

15:14.800 --> 15:17.399
Roy, I am a person. With
thoughts and opinions.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.595
No. You're not.

15:20.604 --> 15:22.915
Jen, please, just say, "It's great."

15:22.924 --> 15:26.919
When people like that ask you what you think,
all they want tohear is that they're geniuses.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.599
Goodbye.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.715
She... is... evil.

15:35.724 --> 15:39.719
Spacestar ordering
success story number three.

15:40.680 --> 15:44.679
My tattoo got infected, so
they've had to cut off my arm!

15:46.040 --> 15:50.039
I am getting a robot hand!

15:52.760 --> 15:55.315
* In the war... *

15:55.324 --> 15:59.319
* I am beautiful... *

16:00.200 --> 16:02.515
Beautiful. Really beautiful.

16:02.524 --> 16:03.555
Thank you.

16:03.564 --> 16:07.559
It's just a great song.
Really, really great.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.919
If you forced me to give one criticism, it'd
be that maybe it goes on just a bit too long.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.675
- Apart from that, perfect.
- Okay.

16:26.684 --> 16:30.679
Listen, Tim, Mary's not going to make it
tonight. What'll we do about backing vocals?

16:35.844 --> 16:38.395
I'd love to!

16:38.404 --> 16:40.955
Moss, can I ask you a question?

16:40.964 --> 16:42.595
Sure.

16:42.604 --> 16:45.995
Do I have to testify?

16:46.004 --> 16:49.035
I can't make that decision for you, Roy.

16:49.044 --> 16:51.195
You've just got to ask
yourself one thing -

16:51.204 --> 16:53.395
if you don't take the stand,

16:53.404 --> 16:57.399
how many more unsolicited bum kisses will
be administered by that lip-happy bastard?

16:58.520 --> 17:01.435
No, you're right, I know you're
right. I do want to testify.

17:01.444 --> 17:04.675
I'm just afraid that
they're going to laugh at me.

17:04.684 --> 17:06.994
What if they're all...what
if they're all like Jen?

17:07.003 --> 17:09.035
They're not going to laugh, Roy.

17:09.044 --> 17:11.115
No-one's like Jen.

17:11.124 --> 17:12.755
No-one.

17:12.763 --> 17:16.759
I've come to realise she's
actually a very odd person.

17:19.364 --> 17:21.595
Well, good luck tonight, everyone!

17:21.604 --> 17:24.755
Are you a big Stevie Nicks fan,
Jen? Stevie Nicks? Yeah, yeah.

17:24.763 --> 17:28.759
Oh, God. Thanks so much for
this, guys, I'm so excited.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.035
I've never done anything
like this before.

17:32.044 --> 17:36.039
I can't believe you want me
to do it! I won't let you down.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.635
So, Norman, we've had a talk.

17:53.644 --> 17:57.235
We think we're going to go back to
not having a keyboard in the band.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.675
Oh, no!

17:58.684 --> 18:01.835
Yeah, I'm sorry, but we'll
see you both again soon, yeah?

18:01.844 --> 18:05.839
Wait! I'm out too?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.995
And the defendant gave no indication

18:19.004 --> 18:22.999
that he had any intention
of kissing you on the bottom?

18:23.200 --> 18:27.199
No indication whatsoever. He just
kissed me on my bottom. Out of nowhere.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.595
What was the result?

18:31.604 --> 18:35.355
Well, I had nightmares about it.

18:35.364 --> 18:39.359
And I can't stop washing my bottom.

18:39.440 --> 18:43.439
And I find it hard to trust masseurs.

18:44.480 --> 18:48.435
Where exactly did he kiss you?

18:48.444 --> 18:51.875
It was in the middle. In
the middle of your bottom?

18:51.884 --> 18:55.835
Well, just to the left
of the cleftal horizon.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.515
In layman's terms,
please, Mr. Trenneman.

18:58.524 --> 19:02.519
Oh, I'm sorry, your Honour.
Just to the left of the bum line.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.035
Just above the thigh?

19:06.044 --> 19:08.155
Well above the thigh.

19:08.164 --> 19:10.555
It was on my bottom.

19:10.564 --> 19:12.875
Although it is true, is it not,

19:12.884 --> 19:16.879
that what some people call their
bottom, others might call their hip.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.315
No, he kissed my bottom, sir.

19:21.324 --> 19:25.319
But is it not true... He
kissed me on my bottom!

19:30.520 --> 19:34.395
Why is no-one laughing?

19:34.404 --> 19:36.635
It's no laughing matter, Jen.

19:36.644 --> 19:40.639
We Spaceologists take this
kind of thing very seriously.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.915
Are all these people Spaceologists?

19:42.924 --> 19:46.715
Yes, this trial could bring the
massage industry to its knees.

19:46.724 --> 19:50.719
And you'll find they take this
case with the gravity it deserves.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.199
Perhaps Mr. Trenneman might be able to
help us with the aid of this diagram.

20:00.120 --> 20:04.119
Could you please place this
picture of the defendant...

20:06.160 --> 20:10.159
...on the area where
you say he kissed you?

20:23.960 --> 20:27.555
That was where the incident happened.

20:27.564 --> 20:30.435
I think that's accurate. Oh,
you think that is accurate?

20:30.444 --> 20:34.315
Yes.Only a moment ago you were
quite sure, yet now you only think.

20:34.324 --> 20:36.235
You're twisting my words.

20:36.244 --> 20:40.239
Is it not true that this may simply be an artist,
proud of his work, signing off with a flourish?

20:42.040 --> 20:44.115
That is not the point.

20:44.124 --> 20:46.195
Yes, thank you, Mr.
Trenneman. That will be all.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.155
My arse is not a canvas!

20:48.164 --> 20:50.675
I said, that will be all, thank you.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.275
My bottom is not a kissing post, sir.

20:53.284 --> 20:59.279
Okay, you can dress this up however you like,
with your fancy words, but the truth remains

20:59.300 --> 21:03.599
that man, sitting there,
kissed me on my bike rack

21:05.040 --> 21:07.115
and I was not expecting it

21:07.124 --> 21:10.195
and it rendered an
expensive massageworthless.

21:10.204 --> 21:11.275
Your Honour, please.

21:11.284 --> 21:15.279
And I am here today so that no man
need be kissed on his sweetmeats

21:16.200 --> 21:20.199
by this man ever again, unless they have
arranged it beforehand for some reason.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.435
Will you be silent?
I will not be silent!

21:23.444 --> 21:26.315
I will never be silent!

21:26.324 --> 21:29.955
I will not stop until
those lips are behind bars!

21:29.964 --> 21:32.475
How dare you?

21:32.484 --> 21:36.479
I trusted you. My trouser
hams are not for sale, sir!

21:38.760 --> 21:42.759
I put my arse in your hands.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.799
I rest my case.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.595
I'd have used my robot hand for good.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.499
Wake up!
