I didn't destroy
that action figure,

10:14.990 --> 10:16.823
But I sure had a motive.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.867
A clear motive.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.078
I don't know why
you're interrogating me.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.290
I have no bone to grind with
that comic book chap.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.877
Really?
Even after comic book guy

10:28.962 --> 10:30.420
Led an online troll army

10:30.547 --> 10:34.007
To demand you be fired
and replaced in this?

10:34.176 --> 10:37.177
[announcer]
<i> from the producers of</i>

10:37.220 --> 10:39.304

10:39.431 --> 10:41.514
<i> And so wacky.</i>

10:41.600 --> 10:43.433

10:43.518 --> 10:48.104
We'll kill them all,

<i> as muttley.</i>

10:51.693 --> 10:53.652
[wheezing laugh]

10:55.739 --> 10:57.572
Curse that funny-book fiend.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.741
He mobilized both
the hanna-barbarians

10:59.868 --> 11:01.660
And the wack-olytes against me

11:01.787 --> 11:04.287
In a devastating
online petition.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.247
[lisa gasps]

11:06.333 --> 11:07.874
[rumbling]

11:08.001 --> 11:09.250
First of all,
that looks so good,

11:09.378 --> 11:11.461
I'm surprised
I didn't direct it.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.380
Did I? October was crazy.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.424
But mel, would your
bone-trembling anger

11:16.510 --> 11:17.509
Lead you to destroy

11:17.594 --> 11:20.470
Comic book guy's
most prized possession?

11:20.597 --> 11:22.722
It would! But it didn't.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.974
But it could! And if I did,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.602
I would lie about it to you now!

11:27.729 --> 11:30.522
But I'm not. But I would!

11:33.151 --> 11:35.110
Why are you
wasting your time with me?

11:35.237 --> 11:37.529
I love my greasy snowman husband

11:37.698 --> 11:40.407
And his tragic blooper
of an action figure.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.660
We have security footage
that says differently.

11:48.291 --> 11:52.961
It's true, I hated that
injection-molded monstrosity.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.255
When I first met comic book guy,

11:55.298 --> 11:57.590
I was his priceless collectible.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.134
But now, when we make love,

11:59.261 --> 12:01.970
My husband calls out
the doll's serial number.

12:02.097 --> 12:06.182
I just want back my sweet
comic book gaijin.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.226
[sobs]

12:11.314 --> 12:14.482
So many passengers could have
committed doll-icide.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.900
Hmm.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.360
Poor bart. Ah, but geez,

12:17.529 --> 12:20.989
Look at the mess
he left in our cabin.

12:21.908 --> 12:22.907
[gasps]

12:23.034 --> 12:26.745
Oh, dear god.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.288
I didn't think bart did it

12:28.457 --> 12:30.373
But then I found
this radioactive head

12:30.459 --> 12:33.126
From the decapitated doll
in bart's stuff.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.587
He looked me right in the eyes

12:35.630 --> 12:37.547
And said he didn't do it.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.591
I can never trust him again.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.134
-[cries]
-oh, sweetie,

12:41.178 --> 12:44.554
You've just learned
one of life's hardest lessons.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.015
Sometimes, no matter
how much you love someone,

12:47.142 --> 12:49.642
They're just
going to let you down.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.269
For your mother, it's me.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.521
Just try to get
some sleep, honey.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.734
Bart will still be
horribly guilty in the morning.

13:00.739 --> 13:01.738
[sighs]

13:01.865 --> 13:03.323
-[knock on door]
-hmm?

13:05.494 --> 13:07.076
Rainer wolfcastle?

13:07.162 --> 13:08.661
There is something
I must tell you

13:08.747 --> 13:12.490
About the night of the fanquet
and subsequent toy murder.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.958
When everything went dark,

13:14.127 --> 13:16.252
I was wearing
my night-vision goggles,

13:16.379 --> 13:18.963
From my upcoming film
<i> the night-vision goggler.</i>

13:19.007 --> 13:20.673
[gasps] did you see who did it?

13:20.708 --> 13:23.843
Patience, fräulein.
I did see the culprit,

13:23.929 --> 13:27.722
And I am about to tell you
who he or she is.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.725
Watch as the words
emerge from my mouth.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.312
The doll murderer
is<i> nein</i> other than--

13:34.356 --> 13:35.688
Ouch.

13:35.732 --> 13:39.526
I will be passing out now
and all of these things.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.236
[groans]

13:41.321 --> 13:42.362
[gasps]

13:50.121 --> 13:52.705
[groans] damn it.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.085
Ugh.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.174
Lisa. Are you also up
dusting for prints?

14:03.301 --> 14:04.968
That's what I call
eating leftover food

14:05.136 --> 14:07.053
Off people's room-service trays.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.431
I don't care!

14:11.434 --> 14:14.060
If one more
horrible thing happens,

14:14.187 --> 14:15.895
I'm going to lose it.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.230
[kumiko screams]

14:17.399 --> 14:21.734
My sweet comic book guy is gone.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.445
Of course he is.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.613
I mean...

14:25.657 --> 14:27.448
[shouts]

14:31.496 --> 14:33.580
Bart's in jail,
our one credible witness

14:33.748 --> 14:34.664
Just got sucker-shielded,

14:34.749 --> 14:36.040
Comic book guy is missing,

14:36.167 --> 14:38.126
And we're still no closer
to solving the case.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.961
So many twists and turns.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.754
What kind of
murder mystery is this?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.340
Stop talking, taika waititi.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.550
That's it.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.176
I know who murdered the toy.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.887
But I just need one thing:

14:49.055 --> 14:52.515
An audience to watch me
milk the big reveal.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.351
The murder of comic book guy's
action figure

14:55.437 --> 14:58.938
Was committed
by comic book guy himself.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.274
Based on a hunch,
I wrote to lloyd's of london,

15:01.401 --> 15:04.527
And I got this response
from lloyd himself. Good guy.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.614
Comic book guy had the doll
appraised and insured

15:07.741 --> 15:10.617
For 935,000 british pounds.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.035
[all exclaiming]

15:12.162 --> 15:13.411
So, he turned off the lights

15:13.496 --> 15:15.955
And murdered
the plastic action man himself

15:16.041 --> 15:17.415
For the insurance money.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.459
But then he knew
that we were onto him,

15:19.544 --> 15:21.544
Or, let's face it,
I was onto him.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.421
So, he took flight
in the dead of night,

15:23.548 --> 15:25.965
But not before planting
the doll's head in bart's cabin,

15:26.051 --> 15:27.842
And knocking out
the one witness to the crime,

15:27.969 --> 15:30.762
Washed-up action star
rainier wolfcastle.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.305
That's fair.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.765
[moans]

15:33.934 --> 15:35.600
Now comic book guy's probably

15:35.727 --> 15:37.852
On a tropical beach somewhere
sipping mai tais.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.396
Little does he know
that his heinous crime

15:40.523 --> 15:43.691
Has been exposed by me,
master sleuth

15:43.777 --> 15:46.027
And star of the upcoming reboot

15:46.112 --> 15:48.363
<i> Kiwi's big adventure,</i>

15:48.490 --> 15:49.948
Taika waititi.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.532
[cheering]

15:51.701 --> 15:54.494
Wow, he really did it.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.665
Oh, my god.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.833
How could I have been so stupid?

16:00.961 --> 16:04.337
Amazing work, taika waititi.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.381
I know you just
cracked the case,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.675
But I have a little
theory of my own.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.468
Does anyone want to hear it?

16:10.553 --> 16:11.761
[all]
no!

16:11.846 --> 16:14.389
Oh, come on, people.
What's the harm?

16:14.474 --> 16:15.723
Thank you, taika.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.308
Now, as you recall,

16:17.352 --> 16:20.728
There were only two of these
irregular radioactive man dolls

16:20.897 --> 16:22.981
Made in the whole world.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.024
-Oh, I remember.
-[murmurs of agreement]

16:25.068 --> 16:27.485
What if the owner
of the other doll

16:27.654 --> 16:29.112
<i> Received some bad news</i>

16:29.239 --> 16:31.406
<i> And broke their action</i>
<i> figure in a fit of rage?</i>

16:31.449 --> 16:35.076
<i>And then what if that owner came</i>
<i> on this cruise specifically</i>

16:35.120 --> 16:38.830
<i>To swap out their broken figure</i>
<i>for comic book guy's intact one</i>

16:38.957 --> 16:41.541
<i> So that they could secretly</i>
<i>possess the only radioactive man</i>

16:41.668 --> 16:44.210
<i> With wolverine claws</i>
<i> left in existence?</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:47.755
And I just discovered something
quite interesting,

16:47.882 --> 16:49.882
Thanks to the ship's
onboard wi-fi,

16:50.051 --> 16:52.635
Which is spotty at best.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.722
According to this website,

16:55.765 --> 16:57.640
That second doll was sold

16:57.767 --> 16:59.350
In wellington, new zealand,

16:59.436 --> 17:02.645
Where they spell "colour"
with a "u."

17:02.731 --> 17:06.941
Now, who on this boat do we know
comes from new zealand?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.360
Well, that's
a very clever theory.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.903
But if it's a crime
to be from new zealand,

17:11.031 --> 17:14.282
You'd have to arrest both guys
from flight of the conchords.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.076
What are their names again?
Fred and jimothy?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.162
You might be right,

17:19.330 --> 17:21.873
But consider that the shield
that incapacitated

17:21.958 --> 17:23.833
The only witness to the crime

17:23.918 --> 17:26.502
Seems to be covered with goo.

17:26.588 --> 17:29.714
What manner of goo?

17:29.799 --> 17:32.175
Dad, I know this is a weird ask,

17:32.302 --> 17:34.552
But would you mind
licking this-- oh.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.887
Ugh. Ew.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.473
Salty. Yeasty.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.476
Ugh. With hints
of malty grossness.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.270
Vegemite,

17:44.397 --> 17:47.148
The favorite food of
taika waititi.

17:47.275 --> 17:51.611
Or should I say fave-o-u-rite.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.529
[crowd muttering]

17:53.615 --> 17:55.823
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about the scratch marks

17:55.909 --> 17:58.159
On bart simpson's face?
Those had to come from

17:58.203 --> 17:59.619
The tiny claws
on the doll he broke.

17:59.704 --> 18:03.998
Did they? Or maybe they came
from this seafood fork.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.541
My dad was selfishly shoveling

18:05.668 --> 18:07.960
<i> Pre-shucked shellfish</i>
<i> down his shrimp-shaft--</i>

18:08.046 --> 18:10.213
<i> One take [chuckles]--</i>
<i> and he accidentally</i>

18:10.373 --> 18:12.715
<i> Scratched bart on his cheek.</i>

18:12.801 --> 18:14.884
That silver-haired
multi-hyphenate

18:15.053 --> 18:16.719
Is guilty as sin.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.429
[chuckles] not without

18:18.556 --> 18:21.015
One more piece of
damning evidence, I'm not.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.476
You can't just
tear my cabin apart!

18:23.603 --> 18:24.894
You need a warrant!

18:24.979 --> 18:28.272
No, we don't.
We're in international waters.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.149
We're in the middle of
lake springfield.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.568
I can see the lard lad statue
from here.

18:32.695 --> 18:36.781
Here it is, comic book guy's
original doll unbroken.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.201
Damn it. Yes, it's true,
lenny. I did it.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.870
I threw my new zealand
radioactive man across the room

18:42.997 --> 18:44.872
When I found out
the streamer was shelving

18:44.999 --> 18:47.708
The second season of my series
without airing it.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.585
For tax purposes?

18:49.712 --> 18:51.087
Yes, for tax purposes.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.506
So I hatched this plan
because I needed the money

18:53.591 --> 18:57.385
To throw into my already
enormous pile of money.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.302
[handcuffs clink]

18:58.388 --> 19:00.429
You haven't seen the last of me.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.974
I've got powerful friends
in new zealand.

19:03.101 --> 19:07.687
Hobbits, orcs, lorde,
ents, melanie lynskey,

19:07.772 --> 19:09.272
The "how bizarre" guy.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.023
We are a powerful nation.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.859
[shrieks] ow! Ow!

19:12.902 --> 19:15.653
There is one thing
I can't figure out.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.613
What happened to comic book guy?

19:17.699 --> 19:19.615
I mean, we looked everywhere.

19:19.701 --> 19:23.369
[gasps] except the one place
he would never go.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.708
Oh, my sarcastic darling.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.418
What happened to you?

19:30.545 --> 19:32.044
Permit me to explain.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.088
[homer]
oh, more explaining?

19:34.215 --> 19:38.676
[comic book guy]
<i> when lisa and taika waititi</i>
<i> began questioning suspects,</i>

19:38.761 --> 19:40.511
<i> I set up a surveillance device</i>

19:40.597 --> 19:44.515
<i>Because I wanted to mock their</i>
<i>inept methods of interrogation.</i>

19:44.601 --> 19:46.767
<i> I hate comic book guy,</i>

19:46.895 --> 19:48.853
<i> But then again,</i>
<i> so does everyone.</i>

19:48.938 --> 19:50.438
<i> He smells like baked beans</i>

19:50.523 --> 19:52.106
<i> That have been left out</i>
<i> in the sun.</i>

19:52.233 --> 19:54.150
<i> I loathe his voice.</i>

19:54.319 --> 19:57.570
<i> Who speaks with such</i>
<i> exaggerated affectation?</i>

19:57.655 --> 19:58.863
[comic book guy]
<i>no one should ever have to hear</i>

19:58.990 --> 20:00.489
<i> What people</i>
<i> actually think of them.</i>

20:00.575 --> 20:04.452
Apparently, I am not a beloved
quirky character, like kramer.

20:04.495 --> 20:08.122
Instead, I am widely reviled,
like the guy who played kramer.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.125
So, I hid here,
surrounded only by shame

20:11.211 --> 20:14.212
And whatever these
metal things are.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.422
Mmm! [grunts happily]

20:16.549 --> 20:18.633
I don't want to get
all sincere and emo,
