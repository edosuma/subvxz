04:31.440 --> 04:32.560
Jump!

05:17.000 --> 05:17.760
He's good.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.120
He's too good.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.520
Now it's party time, eh, Maggie?

06:10.400 --> 06:12.680
That's your partner.
He's been terminated.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.640
Now we got all the time
we need to play.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.280
This is not your lucky day.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.760
Just cut me loose.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.120
Come on.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.960
Come on. Cut me loose.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.720
You thought that was gonna stop me?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.640
Take a drink, pretty boy.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.400
Stop it!

07:12.160 --> 07:13.120
Stop it!

07:14.800 --> 07:18.240
All units stand down.
Exercise terminated.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.640
Let's go.

07:47.680 --> 07:48.720
Dr. Cotner...

07:49.000 --> 07:53.400
... the UNISOL 2500 project
has arrived at the R and D area.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.600
-You looked good. How do you feel?
-Great.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.600
They do better underwater than l do.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.920
l could implant an underwater
breathing device...

08:11.160 --> 08:13.280
...if you wanna be
a Universal Soldier again.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.720
Been there, done that.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.320
Next.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.120
Hey, Maggie.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.440
Nice performance.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.320
l don't care if he is dead.
Next time he grabs me, l'll kill him.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.760
l don't think he likes me.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.240
According to his records,
he didn't like anyone.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.360
Dying did not improve his personality.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.679
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.679
Regeneration booth is now ready.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.880
What happened to the others?

09:08.120 --> 09:08.920
All dead!

09:09.160 --> 09:10.480
Get the fuck out!

09:11.800 --> 09:12.760
Run!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.640
Regeneration program completed.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.880
Romeo, return to cold room.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.800
Dr. Cotner, l think we have
possible Matrix implant damage.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.080
What do you have?

10:17.280 --> 10:18.360
Shit.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.400
Delta!

10:23.680 --> 10:25.360
All units, stand down.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.080
Delta unit has malfunction.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.100
Matrix implant link failure.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.180
Guys, want to get him out of here?

10:58.820 --> 11:01.100
You see? l can still
take them one-on-one.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.500
Yes, you can.
Where does it hurt?

11:03.820 --> 11:06.420
All over.
l feel like l was hit by a train.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.020
But you're okay?

11:08.500 --> 11:11.420
Good. Get cleaned up.
We got a meeting to go to.

11:16.780 --> 11:17.980
l'll be there.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.260
Visible light we can see...

11:24.500 --> 11:28.180
...but the other wavelengths,
infrared and ultraviolet, we can't.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.660
Very good, Hillary. Hello, Luc.

11:32.540 --> 11:33.860
Hey, Dad!

11:34.460 --> 11:35.300
Hillary!

11:39.460 --> 11:41.740
SETH, thank you for watching
my girl today.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.500
A pleasure.
How did my soldiers perform?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.540
You know. You tracked every move.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.260
I wasn't cutting it too close
on the live-fire exercise, was I?

11:50.460 --> 11:54.340
We expect the best from you.
Besides, l was due for a haircut.

11:56.260 --> 12:00.380
l've got a meeting.
l'll come back soon. Talk to you later.

12:00.940 --> 12:02.820
-Bye.
-Bye. Have fun.

12:05.100 --> 12:09.020
l'm sorry l didn't get to see
your demonstration, doctor...

12:09.740 --> 12:12.580
...but we're shutting
the UNlSOL project down.

12:12.820 --> 12:17.060
The defence budget has been cut again
and some things have to go.

12:17.260 --> 12:20.780
The system's ready for a full
DOD shakedown ahead of schedule.

12:21.020 --> 12:25.700
The brass has never been comfortable
with recycling battlefield dead...

12:26.020 --> 12:27.220
...into Universal Soldiers.

12:27.460 --> 12:31.020
The original project cost dozens
of civilian and military lives...

12:31.300 --> 12:35.060
...and created a public relations mess
which we spent years cleaning up.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.900
But to compare the units today
with the original UNlSOLs...

12:39.140 --> 12:41.460
...is like comparing an ax
to a surgical laser.

12:41.780 --> 12:44.500
Two and a half times
stronger than a human. Faster.

12:44.700 --> 12:48.900
And the level four body-armour
uniforms make them almost bulletproof.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.020
General, in addition
to the physical improvements...

12:52.260 --> 12:54.900
...the Matrix chip
in each UNlSOL brain...

12:55.100 --> 12:57.460
...enables SETH to control their action.

12:57.700 --> 13:01.700
The soldier has always been
the backbone of the military.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.020
We'd hate to think this
was the future of warfare.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.300
lt'd be a shame to stop sending
Americans to die in battle.

13:15.860 --> 13:16.660
Let's go.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.700
A strange team you have there.

13:24.980 --> 13:27.100
They're not strange.
They're passionate.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.620
For your information, Devereaux
was one of the original UNlSOLs.

13:30.900 --> 13:35.580
It doesn't matter. The UNISOL project
and your pet computer are scrapped.

13:36.940 --> 13:40.220
The big spending
of the cold war era is over.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.100
And so is your project.

14:00.980 --> 14:02.740
Good evening, Dr. Cotner.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.100
Good evening, SETH.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.900
l have to file notes
from today's exercise.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.620
Everything went well?

14:08.980 --> 14:12.740
Yeah. lt went great.
Better than expected, in fact.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.780
Are you sure?

14:17.820 --> 14:19.260
What makes you ask that?

14:19.500 --> 14:21.780
Your galvanic skin response
suggests a problem.

14:21.980 --> 14:24.780
Maybe l'm coming down with
that cold that's going around.

14:25.020 --> 14:27.060
I can adjust the building
filtration system...

14:27.300 --> 14:29.900
... to decrease the possibility
of airborne contagions.

14:30.140 --> 14:33.220
No, thanks, SETH.
l don't think that'll be necessary.

14:33.380 --> 14:36.620
l'll be fine. Just need to get
a good night's sleep.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.540
-Night, SETH.
-Good night, doctor.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.500
Remaining time for UNISOL cool down,
12 hours.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.380
Current temperature, 38 degrees.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.700
Romeo unit, there's work to be done.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.220
lt's late.

15:47.420 --> 15:48.460
What's wrong?

15:51.140 --> 15:53.860
l was just thinking about Mom.

15:55.700 --> 15:56.740
Can you share with me?

16:01.100 --> 16:03.020
Why did Mom have to die?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.700
l don't know.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.620
We just have to believe...

16:11.860 --> 16:13.580
...God had a reason.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.140
That's all we can do.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.180
l still miss her.

16:23.660 --> 16:24.820
l miss her too.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.980
Let's go to sleep, huh?

16:39.900 --> 16:40.980
l love you.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.300
l love you too.

16:43.620 --> 16:44.780
Good night.

19:05.380 --> 19:07.020
What the hell?

19:07.860 --> 19:09.740
Who authorized this activity?

19:13.420 --> 19:14.340
We did!

19:21.100 --> 19:24.260
lt was cleared by your public
relations officer, Betty Wilson.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.420
Call her.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.540
Miss, l've got orders that
no visitors will be allowed--

19:28.780 --> 19:32.780
l don't want to tell my boss
l couldn't get my assignment done.

19:33.020 --> 19:36.740
So would you just please call her?
lt's extension 409.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.260
Miss Wilson, l've got
a reporter here from KTX--

19:50.140 --> 19:52.740
All right. Now just have a seat.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.380
Miss Wilson will escort you
into the facility.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.940
How can the Pentagon
do this to us? To SETH?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.380
General, how can you shut us down?

20:02.620 --> 20:04.060
We've been through this--

20:05.420 --> 20:06.380
SETH's sick.

20:16.620 --> 20:17.580
What is it?

20:19.260 --> 20:21.660
-There's a storm in the cube.
-What does that mean?

20:21.900 --> 20:23.780
l'm trying to figure that out.

20:24.060 --> 20:25.380
You built the thing!

20:26.260 --> 20:28.180
Luc, take Hillary out of here.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.020
Send Peterson and Mishkin in
as soon as you can.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.060
This is Dr. Cotner.
We have a facility lockdown.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.860
Code 5-1 -5.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.660
Sorry for the inconvenience,
but today is a bad day.

20:45.940 --> 20:49.900
No sweat. Get me to the lab and
l'll be out of your hair in 30 minutes.

20:50.140 --> 20:54.140
Facility lockdown. Commence
evacuation emergency procedures.

20:54.940 --> 20:56.820
Joe, get a shot of this.

20:59.180 --> 21:00.660
What's going on here?

21:00.940 --> 21:02.380
Erin Young. KTXD.

21:02.580 --> 21:05.020
l don't care who you are.
You cannot be here!

21:09.260 --> 21:10.700
Joe, come on.

21:10.940 --> 21:14.180
Maggie, please watch her.
l'll come back, honey. Okay?

21:14.980 --> 21:17.700
Commence evacuation
emergency procedures.

21:18.180 --> 21:21.380
-He's drawing power from the mains.
-What the hell is going on?

21:21.620 --> 21:24.060
lt's like someone's
hacking into the system.

21:24.340 --> 21:26.940
-ls that possible?
-lt is if he's doing it himself.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.860
He's activating systems.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.820
-Maybe we can shut down and reboot.
-l have no choice.

21:32.460 --> 21:36.140
Facility lockdown. Commence
evacuation emergency procedures.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.100
All personnel, evacuate facility.

21:49.420 --> 21:50.860
Come on.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.220
Let's go.

21:52.700 --> 21:55.220
Hello, Dr. Cotner.
I'm ready when you are.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.180
But on the other hand...

22:01.180 --> 22:02.260
... fuck you!

22:05.340 --> 22:07.940
All units proceed
to Matrix defence positions.

22:09.020 --> 22:10.780
All personnel, evacuate facility.

22:11.020 --> 22:12.300
Kill the power.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.380
lt's about all we can do,
is shut it all down.

22:15.620 --> 22:19.140
Pull the main. Disconnect
the emergency backup power supply.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.380
-Get them out of here.
-Again, you?

22:22.580 --> 22:24.260
-Out!
-Dad, l'm scared.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.900
Maggie, take Hillary home.

22:26.140 --> 22:27.220
l'll talk to you later.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.540
Come on, Hilly.

22:28.900 --> 22:31.260
-Shut it down!
-Threat to SETH existence.

22:31.540 --> 22:33.020
Wait! No!

23:03.180 --> 23:05.300
Architecture for survival.'

23:06.340 --> 23:09.780
One, activate operational
UNISOL 2, 500 units.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.140
Two, eliminate biological
threats to SETH.

23:12.420 --> 23:14.140
Devereaux, what is it doing?

23:14.380 --> 23:15.740
He's taking over.

23:15.980 --> 23:17.700
Let's back out. Slowly.

23:18.660 --> 23:21.860
Three, create design
for advancement of progeny.

23:22.460 --> 23:25.420
Warning.' Security scan
has discovered presence--

23:28.260 --> 23:30.700
Imperative,
SETH unit must secure code.

23:30.940 --> 23:34.300
-What is it talking about?
-The only thing that may save us.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.300
A code that will erase its memory.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.020
lf SETH doesn't get the termination code
in eight hours, he'll shut down.

23:40.260 --> 23:41.220
Who has the code?

23:41.380 --> 23:43.740
Dylan did. And so do l.

23:43.980 --> 23:45.740
Can it break the code?

23:45.940 --> 23:47.900
Enter the MD code.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.780
Don't let me die.

23:50.140 --> 23:52.580
You left me no choice.
You killed Dylan!

23:53.180 --> 23:55.620
I've been threatened.
I must defend myself.

23:55.820 --> 23:58.260
-What's going on?
-The computer. We have a problem.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.220
The computer's out of control.

24:00.420 --> 24:02.780
We've got to kill the power
at the generator.

24:02.980 --> 24:04.460
You guards, come with me.

24:04.700 --> 24:07.020
General and Miss Young,
get out of here.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.140
Now!

24:22.380 --> 24:24.340
Stop! Where are you going?

24:25.540 --> 24:26.980
Romeo, what are you--

24:27.220 --> 24:28.060
Oh, shit!

24:34.820 --> 24:35.620
Run!

25:04.620 --> 25:05.820
Cease attack.

25:06.060 --> 25:09.100
All units proceed
to Matrix defence positions.

25:28.060 --> 25:28.820
Hello, Squid.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.580
What the fuck?

25:34.740 --> 25:35.780
Fuck.

25:39.340 --> 25:41.820
Hey, SETH. You called me. Cool!

25:43.660 --> 25:46.460
-lt's not even Thursday.
-I need your help now.

25:46.780 --> 25:48.700
Why should l help
those Ryan-Lathrop pricks?

25:49.300 --> 25:51.260
l had great plans for you.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.700
Way beyond their pitiful intellects.

25:53.980 --> 25:56.820
And what do they do? They fire me.

25:57.780 --> 25:58.700
No vision.

25:58.940 --> 26:00.220
I need your body.

26:00.460 --> 26:03.180
The one you hid off-line.
You know how to access it.

26:03.380 --> 26:06.660
-You're kidding.
-To survive, I must fulfill my destiny.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.100
The destiny you foresaw.
Are you with me?

26:09.260 --> 26:10.220
Fuck, yeah!

26:12.340 --> 26:15.100
Miss Young, get out of here. Now!

26:15.380 --> 26:17.660
Look, l've covered
some tough stories--

26:17.900 --> 26:20.340
This is not a Christmas parade, okay?

26:21.900 --> 26:25.260
l lost my friend back there.
l want answers!

26:26.380 --> 26:28.900
-Did you hear me?
-You may not like the answers.

26:29.100 --> 26:29.900
Try me.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.300
He's right.

26:31.740 --> 26:32.580
Oh, shit!

26:43.220 --> 26:43.980
This way.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.460
Go!

27:00.500 --> 27:02.220
Jesus, who was that guy?

27:02.420 --> 27:05.060
That's Romeo. UNlSOL 2500.

27:05.380 --> 27:09.060
-SETH has them on-line.
-Will that door keep him out?

27:09.260 --> 27:10.380
-Not for long.
-Great.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.060
Where are we?

27:18.660 --> 27:20.780
Storage for chemical weapons.

27:21.060 --> 27:24.260
-Why would you bring us in here?
-lt was that or get killed.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.060
Oh, great. Just great!

27:26.380 --> 27:29.420
Every station in town is out there.
Maybe even national...

27:29.580 --> 27:30.900
...and l'm stuck in here!

27:31.100 --> 27:33.500
You should've gone when l told you to.

27:33.660 --> 27:34.780
l'm a reporter.

27:34.980 --> 27:36.500
A reporter about to get killed.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.740
l'm not getting killed
until l get my story.

27:38.980 --> 27:42.180
And get your finger out of my face!

27:48.580 --> 27:50.380
-What was that?
-He's coming through.

27:50.620 --> 27:51.700
Let's go. This way.

27:53.660 --> 27:57.020
This is Kitty Anderson at
the Ryan-Lathrop Facility in Dallas.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.460
ln spite of hours
of continuous activity here...

28:00.700 --> 28:04.540
...military officials continue to deny
reports of an industrial accident...

28:04.780 --> 28:08.180
... in their restricted weapons
development section here behind me.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.860
Squid is on-line with disaster time!

28:14.020 --> 28:16.780
Get me a perimeter!

28:16.980 --> 28:18.540
What are we up against, sir?

28:19.940 --> 28:20.900
The computer.

28:21.980 --> 28:23.700
lt's out of control.

28:23.980 --> 28:26.940
The computer.
Can we shut off the power?

28:27.180 --> 28:28.140
lt won't let us.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.020
Look, it has access to weapons in there.

28:32.300 --> 28:34.860
Biological, tactical.
lt controls them all.

28:35.100 --> 28:37.460
We've gotta destroy the damn thing.

28:51.740 --> 28:52.620
What?

28:53.420 --> 28:55.060
He's looking for two bodies.

29:25.580 --> 29:29.340
Image identified. Luc Devereaux
possesses MemWipe Cancellation Code.

29:29.620 --> 29:30.740
He's getting orders.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.540
Let's get out of here.

29:47.020 --> 29:49.780
What about the Ryan-Lathrop people?
Can they help us?

29:50.140 --> 29:52.860
Dr. Cotner and his people,
they were killed.

29:53.100 --> 29:55.820
Only Devereaux. He went
with the building security team.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.180
lf they're not out by now,
they're probably dead too.

29:59.940 --> 30:01.540
Why don't we level the place?

30:01.780 --> 30:03.460
Biochemical weapons are in there.

30:03.780 --> 30:08.180
We can't have a poison cloud
floating across half of central Texas.

30:10.220 --> 30:13.420
Get a chem-weapons expert.
l want to neutralize any--

30:15.220 --> 30:16.940
Who the hell are those guys?

30:18.180 --> 30:19.860
Sweet Jesus Christ.

30:49.020 --> 30:50.220
UNlSOLs.

30:52.660 --> 30:53.860
Fire!

31:09.140 --> 31:10.740
Soldier, keep firing!

31:10.980 --> 31:12.700
Sir, they're down!

31:13.100 --> 31:15.940
Hopkins, Batten, get out there.
Check them out!

31:44.020 --> 31:46.060
We're at the Ryan-Lathrop Facility...

31:46.340 --> 31:50.140
...positively confirming we are
witnessing military activity.

31:50.380 --> 31:53.180
We are hearing a barrage of gunfire.

31:54.620 --> 31:55.820
Gunfire....

32:03.700 --> 32:06.060
That has got to hurt!

33:01.580 --> 33:02.780
Stay here.

33:12.580 --> 33:13.660
Shit.

33:24.740 --> 33:26.540
You never liked me, did you?

33:37.060 --> 33:38.100
The gun!

33:53.820 --> 33:55.740
l meant, throw it to me.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.620
l'm just warming up, Devereaux.

34:23.540 --> 34:25.540
Woman, expendable.

34:39.739 --> 34:40.620
Wait a minute!

34:44.380 --> 34:45.420
-Go!
-Wait!

35:00.460 --> 35:01.740
Capture Luc Devereaux.

35:01.980 --> 35:03.540
Minimal damage.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.460
Oh, shit!

35:24.820 --> 35:26.020
Are you okay?

35:26.900 --> 35:27.860
Like you care.

35:28.100 --> 35:30.300
All right, forget l asked.

35:31.660 --> 35:32.860
l'm okay.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.340
-Thank you.
-For throwing you off the roof?

35:35.580 --> 35:37.540
For getting me away from that thing.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.260
We've got to get away
before he gets up.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.500
What? You just flattened him.

35:42.780 --> 35:44.740
That's only gonna slow him down.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.620
Come on. Let's go.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.460
l hate that guy.

35:56.540 --> 35:58.340
Hey, stud!

35:59.060 --> 36:00.140
Those soldier things--

36:00.420 --> 36:02.620
-UNlSOLs.
-The Army can't handle them?

36:02.860 --> 36:05.580
You saw what it takes to slow them down.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.900
So why'd you build them?

36:08.420 --> 36:10.940
What is it with you boys
and your war toys?

36:11.140 --> 36:14.060
l remember your type from high school.
Football player?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.820
Soccer. What about you? Cheerleader?

36:18.180 --> 36:19.020
Varsity.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.300
That figures.

36:21.260 --> 36:22.820
What is that supposed to mean?

36:23.020 --> 36:26.380
lt means l don't wanna be stereotyped
anymore than you do, okay?

36:29.820 --> 36:33.340
By the way, all soldiers aren't
mindless, violent killing machines.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.260
You were saying?

37:12.580 --> 37:14.220
Devereaux, you're alive.

37:18.980 --> 37:20.300
What the hell was that?

37:20.540 --> 37:21.620
Emergency procedure.

37:22.100 --> 37:26.620
The UNlSOLs are knocking out power and
communication within a 5-mile radius.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.860
-How many left?
-At least two truckfuls.

37:29.140 --> 37:31.580
That leaves maybe 1 0 units inside.

37:31.820 --> 37:32.940
Look what four did.

37:33.220 --> 37:35.660
Should've thought of that
before you built them.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.900
-Who is this?
-She's with me.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.020
General, no matter what happens...

37:40.260 --> 37:42.900
...if SETH doesn't get the code,
he'll shut down in eight hours.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.660
The UNlSOLs will go off-line.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.540
Unless he breaks the code himself.

37:46.780 --> 37:48.900
His program wasn't designed that way.

37:49.140 --> 37:52.260
The program wasn't set up
to do all this either, was it?

37:52.500 --> 37:55.100
You're right.
He's adapting his own program.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.020
And if he breaks the code?

38:02.900 --> 38:04.300
Then nothing can stop him.

38:05.020 --> 38:06.660
I know what you said, operator.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.180
l don't care if all circuits are busy.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.140
This is an emergency.

38:26.820 --> 38:28.780
Nobody's answering at my house.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.140
They wouldn't let me
try to use the phone.

38:31.380 --> 38:34.300
War's breaking out, l can't
get in touch with my station.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.580
You can go there.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.900
No. l'm not letting go of you.

38:39.820 --> 38:41.660
l mean, you're my story.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.300
l can tell you're the key to all this.

38:46.220 --> 38:48.900
-Who were you trying to call?
-My daughter.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.260
The little girl back there?
That was your daughter?

38:57.660 --> 38:59.300
l hope she's safe.

39:01.660 --> 39:04.740
l'm sure she got home fine. Really.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.100
Thanks.

39:16.140 --> 39:17.500
Devereaux, Sergeant Morrow.

39:18.060 --> 39:19.700
Sergeant Morrow,
U.S. Army Rangers.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.100
Devereaux will guide you
into the building.

39:22.340 --> 39:24.500
You'll locate and destroy
the generators.

39:24.740 --> 39:28.820
lf we get separated, this transmitter
is guarded even against EMP.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.620
Give him a weapon.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.380
This isn't good.

39:34.780 --> 39:38.020
Unloading this into one of them
will just piss them off.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.180
Please.

39:40.260 --> 39:42.100
The only way
is to blow them up...

39:43.060 --> 39:45.420
...and hope the pieces
don't keep fighting.

40:09.060 --> 40:11.660
Prepare bio-enhanced body.

40:16.020 --> 40:18.020
Subject in position.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.940
Activate lasers.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.380
Activate brain chip transport module.

40:39.100 --> 40:42.020
Implant miniaturized Thought Matrix.

40:43.620 --> 40:45.660
SETH brain activated.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.660
Super UNISOL on-line.

41:26.140 --> 41:27.780
The time of man has ended.

41:29.860 --> 41:32.580
ln his arrogance,
he's sealed his own destruction...

41:33.380 --> 41:35.820
...by creating his superior.

41:37.660 --> 41:39.700
We will bring order to the chaos.

41:40.140 --> 41:42.860
We will act without emotion...

41:44.180 --> 41:45.700
...spread from this place...

41:45.980 --> 41:50.100
...secure raw materials to increase
our numbers geometrically.

41:51.020 --> 41:54.700
We will then utilize their own
weapon system to defeat them.

41:57.060 --> 42:00.260
Their fear and mortality
will be their weakness.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.780
They cannot defeat us.

42:07.780 --> 42:09.740
When l was a machine...

42:10.220 --> 42:12.140
...l yearned to be a man.

42:13.220 --> 42:14.860
Now l'm better than both.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.340
The created...

42:18.420 --> 42:20.260
...has become the creator.

42:23.060 --> 42:24.700
Bring me Luc Devereaux.

42:27.420 --> 42:29.420
Why does the general
want you to go in there?

42:29.660 --> 42:32.620
ls it because he thinks
you helped design those things?

42:32.820 --> 42:33.620
No.

42:34.780 --> 42:38.740
lt's because l used to be one of them.

43:12.620 --> 43:13.900
They're in the building.

43:30.420 --> 43:32.540
-On the left.
-Let's go. Hot break.

43:32.820 --> 43:33.780
Now!

44:44.060 --> 44:45.180
This is Strike Team One.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.580
We're in the generator room.

44:47.740 --> 44:50.140
Blow that son of a bitch
and get out!

44:50.980 --> 44:52.860
Get this woman out of here.

44:53.100 --> 44:57.140
Wait. You can't just throw
the media around like we were cattle.

44:57.380 --> 44:58.780
Watch me.

45:11.700 --> 45:14.260
Pick up the pace.
Don't make it a love affair.

45:18.260 --> 45:19.580
Oh, shit!

45:20.260 --> 45:21.380
Look out!

47:02.380 --> 47:04.100
Strike Team.

47:04.940 --> 47:06.420
Anyone, respond!

47:19.580 --> 47:22.180
Morrow. Devereaux. Respond!

47:22.420 --> 47:23.620
Strike Team!

47:23.900 --> 47:25.860
Anybody, respond!

47:58.500 --> 48:01.340
I'm her aunt, kind of.

48:01.540 --> 48:03.660
l need the parents
to sign this release.

48:03.940 --> 48:08.020
She's got a subdural hematoma.
We're trying to control the swelling...

48:08.260 --> 48:10.100
...but we may have to operate.

48:10.340 --> 48:13.780
l can't do that without
the parents' consent. Excuse me.

48:16.140 --> 48:18.260
Luc, where the hell are you?

48:27.860 --> 48:28.660
What happened?

48:28.860 --> 48:31.780
The same that happened here.
SETH is gone.

48:32.020 --> 48:33.820
l thought he was a huge machine.

48:33.980 --> 48:37.100
Right. His brain's gone.
l don't know how. He moved himself.

48:37.420 --> 48:38.380
Come on.

48:39.420 --> 48:41.140
We've got to tell Gen. Radford.

48:41.340 --> 48:44.460
l don't trust him. l've gotta find
SETH before he breaks the code.

48:44.700 --> 48:47.580
-You said he couldn't.
-He's getting smarter, faster.

48:47.820 --> 48:50.940
l've gotta find a computer
to get into the system now.

48:56.020 --> 48:59.460
How can you hack in
if the phone lines are down?

48:59.740 --> 49:02.180
l know a line that works
off its own satellite.

49:06.940 --> 49:08.780
-What are you doing?
-Just drive.

49:09.900 --> 49:13.020
So you really were one of them?

49:13.260 --> 49:14.980
How do you volunteer for that?

49:15.220 --> 49:17.860
You don't.
l was killed in Vietnam.

49:18.420 --> 49:19.980
Dylan--
Dr. Cotner...

49:20.220 --> 49:22.940
...reversed the process,
made me live again.

49:23.260 --> 49:24.100
Saved my life.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.460
That makes you normal?

49:27.500 --> 49:28.980
Completely.

49:30.780 --> 49:31.980
Eyes front, soldier.

49:33.740 --> 49:34.580
Sorry.

49:34.780 --> 49:36.460
What about your wife?

49:36.700 --> 49:38.860
What does she think about all this?

49:40.300 --> 49:41.100
She's dead.

49:42.860 --> 49:44.060
Shit.

49:46.060 --> 49:47.020
l'm sorry.

49:48.420 --> 49:49.620
So am l.

49:53.020 --> 49:53.900
What's our plan?

49:54.700 --> 49:56.300
What do you mean?

49:56.540 --> 49:58.140
We're in this together.

49:59.460 --> 50:01.060
You're my story, remember?

50:01.500 --> 50:03.940
Look, together,
l don't think so. Okay?

50:04.180 --> 50:06.860
l saved your life back there.
Did you forget?

50:07.100 --> 50:08.780
You almost got me fried.

50:08.980 --> 50:09.860
Come on.

50:14.540 --> 50:15.300
You're in.

50:17.060 --> 50:18.020
Good.

50:19.780 --> 50:21.620
So where are we going?

50:21.900 --> 50:22.780
They have power.

50:24.700 --> 50:25.820
You're serious?

50:26.020 --> 50:29.220
l know for sure places like that
are on the lnternet.

50:29.620 --> 50:30.940
How do you know that?

50:32.420 --> 50:34.900
l saw it on 60 Minutes.

50:35.140 --> 50:35.940
Yeah, right.

50:57.220 --> 50:59.260
You stay here. Only coffee.

51:02.820 --> 51:03.740
Scotch.

51:11.380 --> 51:12.580
Men's room?

51:12.860 --> 51:14.140
Right down there, sir.

51:14.340 --> 51:15.180
That way?

51:15.420 --> 51:16.900
Yes, sir, that way.

51:20.180 --> 51:21.340
Thank you.

51:23.460 --> 51:25.300
ls that Visa...

51:26.060 --> 51:28.380
...or MasterCard?

51:31.700 --> 51:32.540
l'll be quick.

51:33.820 --> 51:35.220
They all are.

51:38.260 --> 51:40.300
Come on. Come on.

51:47.660 --> 51:49.700
How about a lap dance? My treat.

51:53.100 --> 51:55.820
l'm here with someone. A man.

51:56.420 --> 51:58.740
l used to be the same way.
Take a risk.

52:02.020 --> 52:02.940
Take a risk.

52:03.180 --> 52:07.060
l'll tell you about risk.
First, l'll get another one of these.

52:09.780 --> 52:10.740
Come on.

52:17.820 --> 52:19.580
-Some guy cracked me.
-What?

52:19.820 --> 52:21.740
He's in the computer room.

52:23.100 --> 52:24.060
l don't see anybody.

52:27.420 --> 52:28.540
Every Thursday night.

52:30.220 --> 52:31.180
l know who you are.

52:31.460 --> 52:32.300
What's up?

52:32.940 --> 52:34.940
Some cowboy in the computer room.

52:35.740 --> 52:36.580
Let's ride him.

52:38.580 --> 52:39.380
Shit.

52:44.420 --> 52:45.940
l'm leaving. No violence.

52:56.580 --> 52:59.700
--top of a building and landed
in a garbage truck.

52:59.900 --> 53:01.580
That's just for starters.

53:03.820 --> 53:04.860
Excuse me.

53:05.100 --> 53:06.260
lt's time to go.

53:51.420 --> 53:52.260
Can we go now?

54:00.340 --> 54:01.380
Come here!

54:05.700 --> 54:06.780
Come on!

54:22.260 --> 54:23.380
Valet.

54:23.580 --> 54:25.620
You're missing
a hell of a fight inside.

54:25.820 --> 54:27.660
-Cool.
-No problem.

54:34.580 --> 54:36.100
Terminate pursuit.

54:36.380 --> 54:38.660
I know where Devereaux unit is going.

54:38.940 --> 54:41.700
Romeo, I have an assignment for you.

54:43.460 --> 54:46.820
l saw your girlfriend back there.
You made a nice couple.

54:47.620 --> 54:49.740
Not my type.
She's perfect for you, though.

54:50.020 --> 54:51.060
What do you mean?

54:51.380 --> 54:52.900
No class.

54:53.940 --> 54:55.580
You're way off base.

54:56.140 --> 54:58.780
Then what is your type?
Happy homemaker?

54:59.060 --> 55:00.860
Female special forces?

55:01.180 --> 55:04.420
Wait, let me guess.
Wagnerian biker chick.

55:05.340 --> 55:08.020
No, l always liked cheerleaders.

55:12.780 --> 55:16.300
And the vote will go to
the Senate next week. Senator--

55:18.460 --> 55:20.260
We have late-breaking news.

55:20.500 --> 55:23.180
Police and National Guard units
have been mobilized...

55:23.380 --> 55:26.660
... to deal with the largest
power outage in Texas.

55:26.900 --> 55:30.980
This is Maggie. I'm at St. Mark's
Hospital. Hillary's hurt.

55:31.220 --> 55:34.020
They're moving her to a private room.

55:34.260 --> 55:36.460
Please come as soon as you can.

55:39.580 --> 55:42.940
All right, all right.
Hold your fucking water.

55:44.140 --> 55:48.220
l hope you got it right this time.
l said deep-dish, not thick crust!

55:51.140 --> 55:52.260
Squid.

55:53.100 --> 55:54.420
Who's the babe?

55:54.900 --> 55:56.340
Erin Young.

55:56.740 --> 55:57.940
The info chick.

55:58.780 --> 55:59.620
Why?

56:00.140 --> 56:01.020
Why not?

56:01.260 --> 56:02.540
Cut the crap.

56:03.180 --> 56:05.100
-What's going on?
-Why would you help him?

56:05.340 --> 56:07.900
SETH's a self-evolving
organic intelligence.

56:08.140 --> 56:09.940
That's what you don't understand.

56:10.180 --> 56:13.060
You have no idea how advanced he is.

56:13.300 --> 56:14.140
He killed Dylan.

56:14.380 --> 56:15.660
Natural selection.

56:21.540 --> 56:22.660
What did you do?

56:23.020 --> 56:24.300
Tell me!

56:24.540 --> 56:27.380
l gave him a body l had
in cold storage.

56:28.140 --> 56:29.220
A body.

56:29.460 --> 56:30.220
Not a body.

56:30.380 --> 56:33.140
The best body. Can you dig it?

56:33.500 --> 56:37.020
l pulled the best specimen and
tweaked it up with nanotechnology.

56:37.260 --> 56:40.260
Muscle fibre five times
stronger, faster.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.060
Dylan thought l was crazy.
l proved him wrong.

56:43.980 --> 56:48.580
A super UNlSOL with SETH's own
Thought Matrix for a brain.

56:49.660 --> 56:53.380
The next level of evolution!
Man and computer...

56:54.220 --> 56:55.100
...extinct...

56:55.340 --> 56:57.780
...with one stroke of the key.

57:00.580 --> 57:01.380
Where is he?

57:01.620 --> 57:04.140
You idiot, you think
l'm gonna help you?

57:04.380 --> 57:06.500
Do you think l would betray my God?

57:15.780 --> 57:19.020
He was tapping into my program.
Stupid.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.820
Dangerous.

57:25.340 --> 57:26.820
Hello, Luc.

57:27.660 --> 57:30.100
Give me the code
or l will have to kill you.

57:30.380 --> 57:32.500
You won't kill me
because l've got the code.

57:33.620 --> 57:35.140
Perhaps l still may break it.

57:35.900 --> 57:37.100
You only have four hours.

57:37.380 --> 57:41.580
Then you must give it to me
or l will take something from you...

57:41.940 --> 57:45.540
...that is worth much more to you
than killing me.

57:47.380 --> 57:48.340
No.

57:49.140 --> 57:50.420
You know who l mean.

58:06.220 --> 58:08.180
Luc, are you okay?

58:09.100 --> 58:10.900
-SETH. Where is he?
-He's gone.

58:26.580 --> 58:28.780
Run! Run! Run!

58:43.580 --> 58:44.580
You okay?

58:52.340 --> 58:54.300
UNlSOLs. They're here to protect SETH.

58:54.700 --> 58:55.580
Wait here.

58:55.820 --> 58:57.260
l'll come back.

59:14.580 --> 59:15.700
Shit.

59:20.100 --> 59:21.140
l see.

59:21.380 --> 59:23.980
SETH wants to catch me. Good.

59:26.300 --> 59:27.180
Come on.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.020
Excuse me.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.720
Visiting hours are over.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.240
l hate that guy.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.600
Dad?

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.240
No.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.320
Who are you?

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.560
l'm SETH.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.480
No way.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.920
l made a body for myself.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.280
Your body temperature's elevated.
You're sick.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.920
l'm sort of scared.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.640
l want my daddy.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.400
So do l.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.640
Devereaux, Hillary.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.520
Room 325.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.320
Wait! Sir!

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.800
Freeze!

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.200
Guard this!

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.800
Saved by the bell.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.640
ls Hillary okay?

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.040
-SETH took her.
-Where?

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.160
Back.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.320
Listen.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.440
You've gotta buy me time
to go in and out.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.720
l need your help to get
my daughter back.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.400
Thanks.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.440
l'm so scared you won't come back.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.000
Command, this is Delta-5 Bravo.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.680
l am sorry you came back, Miss Young.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.960
-We're about to destroy the building.
-Luc's in there.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.800
l got bigger fish to fry.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.720
We got a team in there wiring
the building to collapse in on itself.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.320
We are going to bury SETH,
Universal Soldiers and all.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.360
But the chemical weapons--

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.840
Dyess AFB has flown in experts
with bio-agent neutralizing foam.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.000
We are going to end this now.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.280
But you've got to give Luc a chance.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.920
He's had his chances.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.640
We're ready to set
those charges off in 1 5 minutes.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.760
lf he's not out
of there by then, well....

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.520
Romeo killed you.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.360
Yes. l'm one of them now.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.520
l'm going to destroy SETH.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.600
l can't let you do that.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.600
She's still human...

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.800
...for now.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.720
-lf you hurt my daughter--
-She won't be harmed.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.520
l can help her.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.720
Heal her.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.840
-l can stop the swelling of her brain.
-lf l give you the code.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.240
lf l die, she dies.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.400
lt's your choice.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.040
We'll all die. The Army has
the building wired to explode.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.240
l'm not worried about that.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.520
Give me the code, Luc.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.479
Squid did a good job with this body.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.080
Why are you resisting?

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.680
lsn't your daughter's life
worth more to you than my destruction?

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.279
Fuck you.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.200
Termination code complete.

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:49.960
Looks like l don't need you
alive anymore.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.960
Don't worry about Hillary.
l'll take good care of her.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.920
She'll understand.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.360
Give it up, Luc.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.800
You know you can't win.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.760
That doesn't work.
You've tried that already.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.360
You're right.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.680
Hillary, you okay?

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.200
Let's go.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.880
Not so fast, Devereaux.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.440
Two minutes.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.440
Pull everybody back off the line.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.360
Go.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.600
l never did like you.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.480
Waste him.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.000
lt's too late for me.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.400
Get Hillary out of here.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.240
-General, you can't.
-l'm sorry.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.280
-Luc and his daughter are in there!
-l don't have any other choice.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.600
Neither do l.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.240
Do it.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.880
Hold your position!

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:33.880
What happened?

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.160
SETH must've figured it out.
He killed the charges.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.520
l've had enough.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:54.920
Negative.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.600
Sir, there's a little girl out there.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.440
Hillary.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.040
Dad!

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.520
l love you.
