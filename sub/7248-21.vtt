00:02.400 --> 00:03.818
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

00:03.901 --> 00:04.902
I'm Dean.

00:04.986 --> 00:06.362
- Max Medina.
- Nice to meet you.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.364
You had a desperate need for cornstarch?

00:08.448 --> 00:10.366
I have very important thickening needs.

00:10.450 --> 00:13.578
- I'd like to see you sometime.
- Are you asking me out on a date?

00:15.330 --> 00:17.624
I got kissed, and I shoplifted.

00:17.749 --> 00:20.126
At some point in your life,
you have to decide...

00:20.210 --> 00:22.712
that some guy
is worth opening that front door for.

00:22.921 --> 00:24.130
- Rory...
- Yeah.

00:24.423 --> 00:25.882
...I love you.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.094
We just broke up.

00:29.178 --> 00:32.055
Maybe we need to
take a little time away from each other.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.226
I'm planning on despising everyone
who says, 'Hey, how's it going?'

00:35.310 --> 00:36.644
You're on.

00:38.021 --> 00:39.898
- Hey, how's it going?
- Rachel.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.358
Your Rachel?

00:41.942 --> 00:42.943
You're Rachel?

00:43.026 --> 00:45.361
- Is she staying?
- I don't know.

00:46.321 --> 00:47.947
- Do you want her to?
- I don't know.

00:48.031 --> 00:51.242
I'd hate to think that I raised a kid
who couldn't say 'I love you. '

00:52.870 --> 00:55.831
I really... miss you.

01:04.299 --> 01:06.092
Dear God Almighty Mr. Mirkle!

01:08.470 --> 01:10.430
- Hey!
- What?

01:11.348 --> 01:13.934
- You are not sleeping through this.
- Through what?

01:14.017 --> 01:16.603
The freaking Blue Man Group
is outside our house!

01:16.687 --> 01:19.731
- I was sleeping through it.
- It had to have woken you up.

01:19.815 --> 01:23.318
No, my insane mother,
Margot Kidder Gilmore, woke me up.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.126
- How are you today?
- Good. How are you?

01:38.210 --> 01:40.212
Good. What are you doing?

01:40.337 --> 01:42.964
- Fixing your porch rail.
- That's right.

01:43.007 --> 01:45.885
You are. You're fixing my porch rail...

01:46.135 --> 01:48.470
at 6:30 in the morning!

01:48.513 --> 01:51.140
- It was the only time I could do it.
- Why?

01:51.182 --> 01:54.060
It was broken.
I noticed last time I was here.

01:54.144 --> 01:57.814
- It could hurt somebody.
- Luke, we sleep around here, okay?

01:57.856 --> 01:59.816
We like it. It makes us pretty...

01:59.858 --> 02:02.527
and keeps us from killing
our crazy friends!

02:02.611 --> 02:04.321
You're gonna wake the neighbors.

02:04.363 --> 02:06.823
Could you pound one more thing
while you're out here?

02:06.907 --> 02:07.949
Your head!

02:08.032 --> 02:11.495
And a 'for sale' sign on the lawn,
'cause we're moving.

02:11.579 --> 02:14.457
So that's two things:
The sign and your head.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.707
And in that order...

02:15.792 --> 02:19.420
'cause otherwise you'll be too dizzy
to do the sign thing!

02:22.591 --> 02:23.758
Shoot!

02:24.468 --> 02:26.970
- You're locked out?
- You don't exist.

02:28.555 --> 02:30.473
You shouldn't have closed the door.

02:32.059 --> 02:33.602
Lorelai, sugar!

02:33.686 --> 02:36.397
You're waking up
the entire neighborhood. Please!

02:36.480 --> 02:37.481
Excuse me!

02:37.565 --> 02:40.025
- I am officially annoyed.
- Well, don't blame me.

02:40.109 --> 02:41.360
Blame...

02:43.071 --> 02:45.073
- He was right here.
- Yeah, I know.

02:45.156 --> 02:46.866
Get her back to bed, doll.

02:46.908 --> 02:49.118
- He was banging on the...
- I know.

02:49.411 --> 02:52.956
It was something on the porch.
It was broken. I'm not crazy.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.042
- He was banging on something.
- I know.

03:53.437 --> 03:55.939
- Michel, get that, please.
- I cannot.

03:56.149 --> 03:57.525
We've been over this.

03:57.609 --> 03:59.777
We all cover the phone. That includes you.

03:59.861 --> 04:03.281
Don't misunderstand.
I wanted to answer it, I truly did.

04:03.323 --> 04:06.367
But today, I'm suffering from ennui.

04:07.327 --> 04:09.954
- Ennui?
- Severe ennui.

04:10.956 --> 04:12.666
You know what ennui is, yes?

04:12.750 --> 04:15.252
Yes, Webster's defines ennui...

04:15.336 --> 04:18.130
as a lazy, soon-to-be-out-of-work
French concierge...

04:18.214 --> 04:21.257
- who won't answer the phone.
- I've made my peace with the fact...

04:21.341 --> 04:23.886
that everyone who calls here
is a notch above brain dead.

04:23.970 --> 04:25.930
And that the pennies
I am thrown each week...

04:26.014 --> 04:30.268
are in exchange for me dealing
with these people in a nonviolent manner.

04:30.352 --> 04:34.147
And usually that is fine, but today,
sorry, lady, I have ennui.

04:34.231 --> 04:35.649
So, you're sleepy?

04:35.732 --> 04:38.818
- It's a metaphysical angst.
- So you want to go beddy-bye?

04:38.903 --> 04:42.490
- You make light, it increases my ennui.
- Okay, that's it.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.241
Come on, you need coffee.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.245
I need coffee, extra strong.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.413
Double caf, triple caf. No, forget the caf.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.375
Throw in the whole cow,
and serve it to this man right here.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.335
What's wrong with you?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.003
I don't know.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.174
It might sound a little weird,
but I think I've got ennui.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.509
You explained ennui to her.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.262
She asked me what was wrong
with me, so I told her.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.014
Michel, you know
that Sookie ends up thinking...

05:06.056 --> 05:08.683
she's coming down with whatever illness
other people have.

05:08.768 --> 05:09.810
No!

05:09.894 --> 05:12.062
No? What was that conversation
last week...

05:12.146 --> 05:14.606
when I had to convince you,
you didn't have a prostate?

05:14.691 --> 05:16.150
How is Al?

05:21.072 --> 05:22.823
- Hello?
- Is this a bad time?

05:22.908 --> 05:24.618
For the hotel industry, but not for you.

05:24.701 --> 05:26.953
I've only got a second,
but I wanted to say hi.

05:27.871 --> 05:30.331
- Thank you for last night.
- It was a good night.

05:30.416 --> 05:32.209
Several novels will be written about it.

05:32.251 --> 05:35.754
I say we do it again, and next time,
I'll be the gypsy queen.

05:35.838 --> 05:37.965
The more I see you,
the more I want to see you.

05:38.049 --> 05:40.343
- Same here.
- It's like a vicious circle.

05:40.426 --> 05:42.428
- It's an achy feeling.
- Like withdrawal pains.

05:42.512 --> 05:43.930
Totally distracting.

05:44.014 --> 05:45.432
And completely wonderful.

05:45.515 --> 05:46.682
I gotta go.

05:46.767 --> 05:48.352
- No, don't.
- Okay.

05:49.061 --> 05:50.020
I gotta go.

05:50.103 --> 05:51.354
- Don't.
- Okay.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.648
This would be another example
of a vicious circle.

05:53.732 --> 05:55.984
- So we should both go.
- We definitely should.

05:57.111 --> 05:58.862
- So...
- Hang up.

05:58.946 --> 06:00.572
- No, you hang up.
- Vicious circle.

06:00.615 --> 06:01.908
Bye.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.743
You look happy.

06:06.329 --> 06:08.247
What's the opposite of ennui?

06:08.832 --> 06:10.083
Off-ui.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.376
Hey, I'm cured!

06:13.587 --> 06:15.213
I had the weirdest dream last night.

06:15.297 --> 06:17.299
We were in our house,
but it wasn't our house.

06:17.382 --> 06:19.717
- It was a Kentucky Fried Chicken.
- I'm hooked.

06:19.969 --> 06:22.429
I had to get dressed,
but my clothes were in the back.

06:22.513 --> 06:25.599
And the guy manning the giant oil vat
would not let me through.

06:25.683 --> 06:27.393
Oh, my God! That's so weird!

06:27.477 --> 06:30.897
When you said 'oil vat,' that
reminded me, I had this dream last night.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.357
We were swimming in a pool,
only it wasn't water.

06:33.441 --> 06:34.859
It was oil or honey or something.

06:34.943 --> 06:36.027
- Hey.
- What?

06:36.111 --> 06:37.821
- You totally did the thing.
- What thing?

06:37.904 --> 06:40.156
Where one person is describing
their dream...

06:40.240 --> 06:41.741
it reminds the other about theirs...

06:41.825 --> 06:43.618
and suddenly it's all about their dream.

06:43.661 --> 06:46.580
The first person is standing there
like, 'What about my dream?'

06:46.664 --> 06:48.707
I'm sorry. The oil-vat guy was mean.

06:48.791 --> 06:52.920
Yes, and we knew him.
He used to live in town.

06:53.004 --> 06:55.172
That guy who used to run
the auto body shop...

06:55.256 --> 06:57.341
before Maybin Hewes bought it.
Remember him?

06:57.425 --> 06:59.135
Of course you do. He was really skinny.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.762
- Peter Stringbean?
- No.

07:02.013 --> 07:04.515
That was the tall circus-freaky guy
who worked for him.

07:04.599 --> 07:07.101
- This was the owner. What was his name?
- I don't know.

07:07.186 --> 07:09.688
Yes, you do. Come on.
It's gonna bug me all day.

07:09.772 --> 07:12.358
He was short and fat and his name was...

07:12.441 --> 07:14.943
- Johnny McShort-and-Fat?
- Don't mock.

07:19.282 --> 07:22.076
Who was the guy who used to run
the auto body shop?

07:22.160 --> 07:25.288
- That Stretch Cunningham guy?
- No, the Dick Tracy guy.

07:25.372 --> 07:27.582
Big, always had a half-smoked cigar
in his mouth?

07:27.666 --> 07:29.251
Yes. What was his name?

07:29.376 --> 07:32.128
- It was Jim something-or-other.
- Had an 'ing' at the end.

07:32.212 --> 07:34.172
- Yes, Banning.
- Lanning.

07:34.214 --> 07:36.007
- Dunning.
- That's it.

07:36.592 --> 07:39.595
Hey, Jim Dunning was the Dick Tracy guy.

07:43.349 --> 07:46.018
Jim Dunning, that's the Dick Tracy guy.

07:47.729 --> 07:49.188
The Dean box.

07:49.898 --> 07:52.442
Okay. I know I was supposed
to throw it away...

07:52.526 --> 07:54.027
but I couldn't.

07:54.444 --> 07:57.322
I mean, you're young,
and your head's all weird...

07:57.406 --> 07:59.032
and you don't have any perspective...

07:59.074 --> 08:01.284
because of that whole young,
weird-headed thing.

08:01.368 --> 08:03.536
So please listen to me before you get mad.

08:04.497 --> 08:06.540
You're gonna want that stuff one day...

08:06.624 --> 08:09.460
when you're old and married
and looking back and thinking:

08:09.544 --> 08:11.546
'I certainly had an interesting life. '

08:11.629 --> 08:15.091
And then you can pull out all
your old-boyfriend boxes, which is good...

08:15.175 --> 08:17.969
because I threw away stuff
I'd kill to have today.

08:18.220 --> 08:20.889
Look, I put it in with the Max box...

08:20.931 --> 08:23.642
so they could chat
and keep each other company...

08:23.767 --> 08:26.227
and commiserate about
how they had a Gilmore girl...

08:26.270 --> 08:27.896
and lost a Gilmore girl.

08:27.980 --> 08:29.147
Sorry.

08:31.776 --> 08:32.943
Thanks.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.908
What I wanted to say was:

09:17.950 --> 09:20.536
'Janie Fertman,
you are a vacuous bimbo...

09:20.619 --> 09:22.579
'who'll turn letters as a profession
one day.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.874
'And you'll know which one to turn
only when it dings and lights up.

09:25.958 --> 09:28.710
'I have no desire to stop
and talk to you ever. '

09:28.795 --> 09:30.463
But what I said was, 'What, Janie?'

09:30.547 --> 09:33.425
And then she goes,
'You're cheerleader material. '

09:33.592 --> 09:37.471
Just like that! I couldn't believe it.
I almost went full matrix on her.

09:37.930 --> 09:39.640
- Have you heard a word I've said?
- Nope.

09:39.723 --> 09:42.642
I resent that. I'm a witty conversationalist.

09:42.685 --> 09:43.811
What?

09:44.562 --> 09:46.355
- I'm going in.
- You can't.

09:46.439 --> 09:48.274
- I'm going in.
- It's Thursday afternoon.

09:48.357 --> 09:50.192
- I know.
- He works on Thursday afternoons.

09:50.276 --> 09:52.361
- We're talking you-know-who.
- I know.

09:52.987 --> 09:54.488
- Oh, my God!
- Calm down.

09:54.572 --> 09:57.324
- You're making a spectacle.
- You're getting back with Dean!

09:57.367 --> 09:58.660
If you keep jumping like that...

09:58.743 --> 10:01.621
I'll videotape it
and send it as your cheerleader audition.

10:01.705 --> 10:03.957
- When did this happen?
- Nothing's happened.

10:03.999 --> 10:06.668
I don't even know what I'm doing exactly.

10:06.710 --> 10:08.169
Or what he's thinking...

10:08.212 --> 10:10.547
or whether he's burned
all my letters and pictures...

10:10.631 --> 10:13.133
or hates me or what. But I'm going in.

10:13.175 --> 10:14.718
I so encourage this. I love you.

10:14.802 --> 10:16.470
But you've been mopey, dopey...

10:16.554 --> 10:19.473
and about 12 other melancholy dwarves,
for the past five weeks.

10:19.557 --> 10:21.600
- I miss the old Rory.
- I miss the old me, too.

10:21.685 --> 10:24.813
- I've been feeling bad for the new Rory.
- She's staging a comeback.

10:24.896 --> 10:26.981
May it be more successful
than Peter Frampton's.

10:27.024 --> 10:28.817
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

10:53.677 --> 10:55.762
- Rory?
- Taylor, you scared me.

10:55.846 --> 10:58.056
What are you doing?
You're walking around like...

10:58.140 --> 11:00.600
- Like what?
- Dare I say, like a shoplifter.

11:00.684 --> 11:02.185
I'm not here to shoplift.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.814
- You fit four of the eight characteristics.
- I do?

11:04.897 --> 11:08.567
You're alone. You look nervous.
You're meandering in an aimless fashion.

11:08.610 --> 11:11.571
- And you're wearing a baggy coat.
- I tend to run cold.

11:11.654 --> 11:13.697
So, what are you here for?

11:13.782 --> 11:15.575
I'm looking for your checkout boy.

11:15.659 --> 11:18.495
I had a question,
and I didn't want to bother you.

11:18.579 --> 11:21.206
He's stacking on 6. Over here, please.

11:23.918 --> 11:27.672
Mikey, this is Miss Gilmore.
She needs some help. Take care, Rory.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.172
Watch her.

11:29.590 --> 11:30.674
Yeah?

11:33.261 --> 11:36.597
I was just wondering,
do you like working here?

11:36.681 --> 11:37.807
What?

11:38.183 --> 11:41.978
I mean, do you enjoy
the whole box-boy trade as a profession?

11:42.270 --> 11:44.564
- No.
- Okay, good.

11:44.648 --> 11:47.442
So, I'm just gonna cross that off my list.

11:47.860 --> 11:49.862
Thank you for your time.

11:52.573 --> 11:54.783
- Well?
- He's not there.

11:54.867 --> 11:56.326
But he always works Thursdays.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.997
I guess he's taking
Thursday afternoons off now.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.540
- That's not good.
- How's that not good?

12:01.624 --> 12:04.293
- That means he's moved on.
- What are you talking about?

12:04.377 --> 12:06.754
He's met
one of those Thursday-afternoon girls.

12:06.838 --> 12:08.297
What's a Thursday-afternoon girl?

12:08.382 --> 12:09.591
They're slutty girls...

12:09.675 --> 12:13.595
that get guys to switch their Thursday
afternoons with another checkout guy...

12:13.679 --> 12:15.973
so they can go do
slutty Thursday-afternoon things.

12:16.015 --> 12:17.474
You're reading too much into this.

12:17.516 --> 12:19.684
- I shouldn't have gone in.
- It was good to go in.

12:19.769 --> 12:22.521
Taylor thinks I'm casing the place.
Like I'd shoplift there.

12:22.605 --> 12:24.231
You have shoplifted there.

12:24.315 --> 12:25.649
I'm gonna ask you a question.

12:25.692 --> 12:28.528
I want you to be more honest
than you've ever been.

12:28.611 --> 12:31.155
Have you ever seen him
with another girl at school?

12:31.239 --> 12:32.281
No!

12:32.324 --> 12:34.117
- You'd tell me, right?
- Yes.

12:34.201 --> 12:37.037
I wouldn't because it would break
your heart. But I haven't.

12:37.121 --> 12:39.623
You swear on the life
of the lead singer of Blur?

12:39.707 --> 12:41.792
On the soul of Nico, I swear to you...

12:41.876 --> 12:44.170
that I have not seen Dean
with another girl.

12:44.253 --> 12:45.337
Okay.

12:46.297 --> 12:48.382
- He's miserable.
- Fine.

12:48.466 --> 12:49.967
- Suicidal.
- Good.

12:50.051 --> 12:52.929
- And in desperate need of a haircut.
- Thank you.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.034
- You should decorate this thing.
- I did.

13:14.118 --> 13:17.538
With something other than
a bunch of dead, black and white women.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.374
- What, like curtains?
- You know what I mean. I did mine up.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.459
I saw that.

13:21.543 --> 13:25.005
The naked picture of the Siamese twins
is particularly classy.

13:25.088 --> 13:27.340
- You know what these are?
- They look like tickets.

13:27.382 --> 13:28.883
To P.J. Harvey.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.885
You have good taste. I'll give you that.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.513
You're into P.J. Harvey, right?

13:32.596 --> 13:35.265
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- I'm all-knowing.

13:35.349 --> 13:38.227
- How godlike of you.
- One of these is for you.

13:38.352 --> 13:40.812
I don't think we should go
to a concert together.

13:40.897 --> 13:42.690
- Reason?
- It would seem like a date.

13:42.774 --> 13:45.234
It would seem like a date
because it would be a date.

13:45.277 --> 13:48.155
- I can't date you, Tristan.
- I give you permission.

13:48.488 --> 13:50.281
And on that humble note...

13:52.534 --> 13:54.661
Rory, favor, big one.

13:55.245 --> 13:56.955
- Look at the face.
- Sure. What?

13:57.039 --> 13:59.458
Can I get your Biology notes
from Tuesday? I was out.

13:59.542 --> 14:01.168
- To lunch.
- Please.

14:01.252 --> 14:03.379
I have them at home.
I can bring them later.

14:03.421 --> 14:05.756
- Thank you.
- One more, and you're done.

14:07.425 --> 14:10.428
So, I've decided
I'm now completely into Judy Garland.

14:10.470 --> 14:12.597
Did you see the TV movie? Pretty intense.

14:12.681 --> 14:14.766
I think they used
my mother's medicine cabinet.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.268
She was Courtney Love of her day.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.103
Show me a trend, I'll show you Madeline.

14:18.187 --> 14:20.022
- Judy Garland is trendy?
- Completely.

14:20.105 --> 14:21.940
She's neo-addict retro chic.

14:21.982 --> 14:23.900
No one tells me these things.

14:24.819 --> 14:25.903
What are those?

14:25.987 --> 14:27.947
- P.J. Harvey tickets.
- Really?

14:28.448 --> 14:30.241
- Who are you going with?
- Rory.

14:30.283 --> 14:33.703
- What? Rory's going out with you?
- Yes, she is.

14:36.206 --> 14:39.209
- I didn't think she liked him.
- Neither did I.

14:41.461 --> 14:43.129
Do you think she's mad?

14:43.213 --> 14:45.548
What are you two waiting for,
a tram? Let's move.

14:45.633 --> 14:47.718
Oh, yeah. She's mad.

14:48.177 --> 14:49.386
Flutter.

14:50.304 --> 14:51.513
Quick.

14:56.936 --> 15:00.189
And your hearts are broken.

15:00.273 --> 15:02.567
Your prince has betrayed you.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.819
You've been shot with an arrow...

15:04.861 --> 15:08.156
and now, you're dead.

15:08.615 --> 15:09.949
Hi, Patty.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.244
- Lorelai.
- Hey, Rachel.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.789
- Have you seen Luke around?
- He's probably at the diner.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.333
He was supposed to be at the diner,
but he's not.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.296
We were supposed to meet for lunch,
but he didn't show.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.590
- Again. I made tuna.
- Nice.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.553
He comes back upstairs for
a little break between lunch and dinner.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.597
But recently, he's been...

15:30.681 --> 15:33.851
Other places, your place, actually.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.314
- Rachel, he's just fixing some things.
- I know.

15:40.733 --> 15:44.153
The porch rail, a couple roof shingles,
then the porch rail again...

15:44.237 --> 15:46.322
after he fell off the roof
onto the porch rail.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.324
- Yeah, he's been telling me.
- Good.

15:48.366 --> 15:51.369
Look, if you see him,
could you tell him to just...

15:51.411 --> 15:53.496
- I don't know, check in?
- Yes. Will do.

15:53.538 --> 15:54.956
Thanks. Bye.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.253
Hello?

16:50.599 --> 16:53.560
- Hold it right there!
- It's only me.

16:53.602 --> 16:56.104
- You scared me half to death!
- Who'd you think it was?

16:56.147 --> 16:58.607
I don't know! I heard thudding upstairs...

16:58.649 --> 17:00.734
and Rory weighs, like, 10 ounces.

17:00.777 --> 17:02.528
It either had be an escaped elephant...

17:02.612 --> 17:05.281
or some strange, large man
who should not be in the house.

17:05.323 --> 17:06.616
How did you get in here?

17:06.700 --> 17:08.785
- Through the back door.
- The back door's locked.

17:08.868 --> 17:11.079
That's why I came.
The back door lock was broken.

17:11.121 --> 17:13.164
- It was fine.
- It was cheap.

17:13.248 --> 17:15.750
The back door lock came with the house.
It's been fine.

17:15.792 --> 17:17.795
It's the kind of lock burglars look for.

17:17.877 --> 17:21.048
- Why do they look for it?
- It's easy to break into. I proved that.

17:21.132 --> 17:23.300
- You proved that by...
- Breaking in.

17:23.384 --> 17:26.011
- Oh, my God!
- It's the only way I could get in.

17:26.095 --> 17:28.639
You have crossed over
into the dark side, Luke.

17:28.723 --> 17:30.308
It's not that big a deal.

17:30.391 --> 17:33.394
- You broke into my house!
- I'm gonna fix it.

17:34.771 --> 17:36.230
- Step away from that lock.
- What?

17:36.314 --> 17:38.274
Get off. Come, sit down.

17:39.443 --> 17:42.112
You have almost no free time
with your work at the diner.

17:42.154 --> 17:45.324
And lately,
every spare moment has been spent...

17:45.407 --> 17:47.450
- not with Rachel.
- That's not true.

17:47.535 --> 17:50.121
She was looking for you,
she didn't know where you were.

17:50.204 --> 17:52.206
- I'm not hiding from her.
- I didn't say that.

17:52.290 --> 17:53.624
You were implying it.

17:53.666 --> 17:56.502
Someone's sensitive about the accusation.

17:56.795 --> 17:59.005
- I think I'm hiding.
- I think you are, too.

17:59.089 --> 18:01.299
It's just a little weird
having her in my place.

18:01.383 --> 18:04.553
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- It was... Is.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.138
I'm just...

18:07.097 --> 18:10.559
I've just been living alone since... Forever.

18:10.643 --> 18:14.021
And I got used to putting the milk
someplace in the fridge...

18:14.063 --> 18:17.191
and finding it in the exact same spot,
you know what I mean.

18:17.275 --> 18:19.652
- We don't keep milk in the house.
- Then, cookies.

18:19.694 --> 18:22.697
- Cookies never make it out of the car.
- You know what I mean.

18:22.739 --> 18:26.034
Maybe you can train Rachel
to use a magic marker...

18:26.076 --> 18:28.411
to mark the milk exactly where you left it.

18:28.495 --> 18:29.579
It's not just about milk.

18:29.663 --> 18:32.541
I'm not used to someone expecting me.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.753
- Expecting you to...
- Come home, do things, be with her.

18:36.712 --> 18:39.172
Most people would kill
to have that in their lives.

18:39.257 --> 18:42.218
I know. But I'm different. I'm a loner.

18:44.053 --> 18:46.931
I don't want to hear
about the romance of being a loner.

18:47.015 --> 18:48.725
Some guys are just naturally loners.

18:48.808 --> 18:50.601
- Yes, lonely guys.
- Independent guys.

18:50.685 --> 18:52.395
- Sad guys.
- Maverick guys.

18:52.479 --> 18:53.772
- Lee Harvey Oswald.
- John Muir.

18:53.855 --> 18:55.565
- The Unabomber.
- Henry David Thoreau.

18:55.607 --> 18:58.193
Every one of these, sad and lonely guys.

18:58.235 --> 19:01.238
It's not what I thought it would be like
having Rachel back.

19:01.322 --> 19:04.575
It's not the fantasy I was toting around
all these years.

19:04.659 --> 19:06.536
Life is not a fantasy.

19:06.577 --> 19:09.413
Maybe you have to lower
your expectation bar a little bit.

19:09.497 --> 19:11.332
So you're saying that life is...

19:11.416 --> 19:13.459
just settling for whatever comes along?

19:13.543 --> 19:15.503
You think having Rachel is settling?

19:15.587 --> 19:17.881
No, I didn't mean that. Rachel's great.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.549
And she's crazy about you.

19:21.176 --> 19:25.221
If her worst trait is she's a milk whore,
you have it pretty good.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.185
And you just need to give
this situation a fair chance.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.436
I know.

19:32.313 --> 19:36.358
And that starts with ceasing work
on the Winchester Mystery House here.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.739
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

20:00.134 --> 20:01.635
How are you today?

20:01.719 --> 20:03.637
- Fine.
- Good.

20:04.514 --> 20:06.516
Are you here to see my brother?

20:06.641 --> 20:08.643
No, not at all.

20:08.727 --> 20:11.855
I'm with the Girl Scouts.

20:11.980 --> 20:15.275
I'm gonna be a Girl Scout someday.
I'm a Brownie now.

20:15.317 --> 20:18.153
Good. That's an excellent stepping stone.

20:18.988 --> 20:20.698
Where's your uniform?

20:20.781 --> 20:22.407
We don't do uniforms anymore.

20:22.492 --> 20:26.329
We're trying to blend in,
relate better to the average person.

20:26.371 --> 20:28.998
It was a very successful strategy
for the Hare Krishnas.

20:29.082 --> 20:30.750
- You look like someone.
- I do?

20:30.834 --> 20:32.252
You're the girl in the pictures.

20:32.335 --> 20:34.587
- What pictures?
- The ones Dean has in his room.

20:34.671 --> 20:36.047
Dean has pictures in his room?

20:36.131 --> 20:39.509
There's a funny one of you sticking out
your tongue. He had a lot.

20:39.551 --> 20:41.010
- Wait, has or had?
- What?

20:41.053 --> 20:43.138
You went from 'has' to 'had':
A big difference.

20:43.180 --> 20:44.806
- It is?
- Yeah.

20:46.976 --> 20:48.519
- What's your name?
- Clara.

20:48.603 --> 20:50.688
- You're a pretty girl, Clara.
- Thanks.

20:50.772 --> 20:52.815
- Now, is it has or had?
- I don't know.

20:52.899 --> 20:55.818
You do know. 'Had' is past-tense,
'has' is present. Now think.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.903
- I'm trying.
- Can you go to his room now?

20:58.029 --> 21:00.865
- He doesn't like me there.
- Sneak in, he'll never know.

21:01.700 --> 21:05.745
Oh, no, Clara, don't cry.
I didn't mean to make you cry.

21:05.871 --> 21:08.498
I'm a nice person. I'm a Girl Scout.

21:08.582 --> 21:10.375
- Clara.
- Bye.

21:13.045 --> 21:15.505
- What's the matter?
- She scared me.

21:15.882 --> 21:18.050
- Who?
- The Girl Scout.

21:26.727 --> 21:29.980
We've got food, drink, reading material...

21:30.064 --> 21:33.108
chocolate-covered espresso beans.
Have I left anything out?

21:33.192 --> 21:35.611
- That about covers it.
- You're such a good provider.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.197
- I try my best.
- Sure you want to go to this thing?

21:38.239 --> 21:41.867
You're always talking about these
town meetings. I've to see one for myself.

21:41.910 --> 21:44.913
- They're never dull.
- Lf you're lucky, you'll see a crazy lady...

21:44.996 --> 21:47.248
throwing French fries at those
she disagrees with.

21:47.332 --> 21:48.583
Like last time.

21:48.625 --> 21:50.919
- So, were they cold?
- No, I was just full.

21:52.170 --> 21:53.629
I forgot.

21:54.757 --> 21:56.216
One for you...

21:56.634 --> 21:59.470
- and one for you.
- What are these?

21:59.553 --> 22:03.140
Those are rings, and the diamonds
are actually candy so you can eat it.

22:03.224 --> 22:05.935
Max, that's very sweet,
but we're not eight.

22:06.853 --> 22:08.396
- What do you got?
- Grape. Yours?

22:08.438 --> 22:09.939
- Red.
- Trade you.

22:11.524 --> 22:13.609
Enough of this arguing.

22:13.693 --> 22:16.028
It's time to put this to a vote.

22:16.822 --> 22:20.742
All right, now, let's see a show of hands.
All those in favor?

22:20.784 --> 22:22.452
Rats, it started already.

22:22.536 --> 22:24.204
All those opposed?

22:26.123 --> 22:28.625
Lorelai, you don't even know
what we're voting on.

22:28.668 --> 22:30.545
Yeah, but I'm agin it!

22:31.254 --> 22:34.966
All right, the nays have it.
Let the record reflect it.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.801
Lorelai, I hope
that's not food in those bags.

22:37.886 --> 22:39.554
Food is not allowed at town meetings.

22:39.638 --> 22:42.307
No, Taylor, it's diapers for the little ones.

22:42.349 --> 22:44.517
- The what?
- Dorsal fins and Cucamonga.

22:44.601 --> 22:45.643
What did she say?

22:45.728 --> 22:48.898
I confuse him till he loses
his train of thought. Then he moves on.

22:48.981 --> 22:52.818
I'd like to open the meeting up
for miscellaneous issues.

22:52.860 --> 22:54.820
- I have an issue.
- Who are you?

22:54.904 --> 22:56.822
- The town troubadour.
- The what?

22:56.906 --> 22:59.283
You've seen him, Taylor, with his guitar.

22:59.325 --> 23:01.160
Right, the guitar.

23:01.202 --> 23:03.037
He plays on all the street corners.

23:03.121 --> 23:05.289
He loiters on street corners.

23:05.332 --> 23:07.834
- We are two peas in a pod.
- Scary thought, Taylor.

23:07.876 --> 23:09.669
- Go on, honey.
- Thank you.

23:09.711 --> 23:12.338
I've been the town troubadour
for six months now...

23:12.423 --> 23:14.341
and I think I've done a pretty good job.

23:14.383 --> 23:16.468
And then he shows up.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.556
There's no room for a second troubadour
in Stars Hollow.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.641
Clearly.

23:21.683 --> 23:24.519
This is the silliest thing I have ever heard.

23:24.602 --> 23:26.812
Hear them out. It can't hurt.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.858
These are not fries.
They are Fahrvenugen Soogan Dugan.

23:30.942 --> 23:34.987
I opened the floor for issues of substance.
This does not qualify.

23:35.072 --> 23:38.158
Don't be uncool, Taylor.
Music is substance.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.284
Watch out, Morey.

23:39.368 --> 23:42.871
After that anatomically explicit epithet
your wife yelled at me earlier...

23:42.955 --> 23:44.122
you're both on probation.

23:44.207 --> 23:47.043
All I'm asking is that
the town troubadour laws be enforced.

23:47.085 --> 23:49.379
There are no town troubadour laws.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.088
There ought to be something.

23:51.172 --> 23:52.840
I've got the town handbook right here.

23:52.882 --> 23:55.885
I don't get this, people.
This man is practically a vagrant.

23:55.969 --> 23:58.304
Where do you even live?
What do you do for a living?

23:58.388 --> 24:00.723
- I don't want people to know those things.
- Why not?

24:00.766 --> 24:04.228
- That's part of being a troubadour.
- What is part of being a troubadour?

24:04.311 --> 24:05.687
The mystique.

24:05.729 --> 24:08.690
This is absolutely ridiculous!

24:09.233 --> 24:12.569
Do you subscribe
to this troubadour mystique?

24:12.612 --> 24:14.947
I run a Kinko's in Groton.

24:15.031 --> 24:18.367
You see? That proves it.
He doesn't respect the code.

24:18.410 --> 24:21.830
You're not supposed to talk,
you're not supposed to run a Kinko's.

24:21.913 --> 24:24.290
You are supposed to
speak through your music.

24:24.374 --> 24:25.750
That's the whole point.

24:25.793 --> 24:27.920
- What is your scam, buddy?
- My scam?

24:28.003 --> 24:32.174
If you are using the fine people
of Stars Hollow to make a quick buck...

24:32.258 --> 24:36.387
No, Taylor, he doesn't accept money.
I know, I tried.

24:36.429 --> 24:38.931
He may not now, but he will.

24:39.307 --> 24:42.226
This troubadour act
is a money-making scheme.

24:42.268 --> 24:43.602
Why else would he be doing it?

24:43.687 --> 24:46.106
Sometimes you have something to say,
but you can't...

24:46.148 --> 24:50.068
because the words won't come out,
or you get scared, or feel stupid.

24:50.110 --> 24:54.155
So, if you could write a song and sing it,
then you could say what you need to.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.450
It would be beautiful,
and people would listen...

24:56.492 --> 24:58.952
and you wouldn't make
a complete idiot out of yourself.

24:59.036 --> 25:00.579
But all of us can't be songwriters.

25:00.663 --> 25:03.499
So some of us will never be able to say
what we're thinking...

25:03.583 --> 25:05.585
or what we want others to know
we're thinking.

25:05.668 --> 25:09.130
So we'll never get the chance
to make things right again, ever.

25:12.467 --> 25:15.428
So, give this guy a license.

25:21.018 --> 25:22.978
I liked that little speech.

25:23.145 --> 25:24.187
That's the Girl Scout.

25:24.272 --> 25:27.442
In the interest of not talking
on this subject for another second...

25:27.525 --> 25:30.695
I hereby designate mystique guy
over here...

25:30.778 --> 25:32.988
the official town troubadour.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.326
And no other troubadour
may usurp his territory...

25:36.368 --> 25:38.328
meaning this other guy.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.711
Do you want some fries? We have extra.

25:45.794 --> 25:49.005
No, Rachel's minding the store,
so I should probably get going.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.509
- Yeah, I agree.
- I knew you would.

26:05.941 --> 26:07.067
You're back.

26:07.151 --> 26:09.737
Yeah, there's nothing much pressing
at the town meeting.

26:09.820 --> 26:12.322
Okay, the bread shipment's all put away...

26:12.406 --> 26:14.658
and I sent Caesar home
since it was pretty dead.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.952
- Good call.
- Thanks.

26:24.836 --> 26:26.504
So you're leaving?

26:28.465 --> 26:31.009
- Yeah.
- Were you even gonna tell me?

26:31.051 --> 26:34.429
I was waiting for you to get back,
so I could say goodbye.

26:34.513 --> 26:37.891
Yeah, you at least always do that.

26:39.101 --> 26:40.310
So, go.

26:41.145 --> 26:43.272
Don't you even want to know why?

26:43.356 --> 26:46.025
- I know why.
- I don't think you do.

26:46.109 --> 26:48.319
It's just like all the other times, Rachel.

26:48.403 --> 26:52.240
You're the 'anywhere but here' girl.
You're restless, you're bored.

26:53.366 --> 26:55.576
- It is what it is.
- That's not it.

26:55.661 --> 26:57.913
Then what is it? Is there another guy?

26:57.996 --> 26:59.372
- No.
- Then what?

26:59.415 --> 27:01.041
It's another girl.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.292
What?

27:02.918 --> 27:04.127
You're telling me...

27:04.211 --> 27:06.713
The other girl isn't for me, Luke,
it's for you.

27:06.756 --> 27:08.090
Now, that's crazy.

27:08.132 --> 27:09.258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:09.342 --> 27:13.179
You feel you need a different excuse
this time, to mix things up a little. Fine.

27:13.263 --> 27:17.017
- But you are not leaving because of me.
- I'm sure you tried, Luke.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.810
But admit it. Your heart wasn't in it.

27:18.894 --> 27:21.938
My heart was in it.
I was here. I didn't leave.

27:23.607 --> 27:28.195
I don't get this. What're you talking about?
Another girl? What other girl?

27:31.449 --> 27:32.950
Rachel, no.

27:33.367 --> 27:34.785
You don't mean...

27:34.827 --> 27:37.788
She and I are just friends.
I told you that a thousand times.

27:37.831 --> 27:40.625
No. You told it to me once.

27:41.585 --> 27:44.171
And you could barely get it out then.

27:45.422 --> 27:47.465
This is crazy.

27:48.592 --> 27:50.594
You've got it wrong here.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.222
It's not...

27:54.056 --> 27:55.724
She and I are...

27:57.185 --> 27:58.644
I'm gonna go.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.441
I'll miss you.

28:06.611 --> 28:08.112
Stay in touch.

28:10.741 --> 28:12.326
Rachel, come on.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.165
So don't wait too long, okay?

28:18.249 --> 28:19.500
To what?

28:20.209 --> 28:21.668
To tell her.

28:31.930 --> 28:34.224
Madeline, I got the notes you wanted.

28:34.307 --> 28:36.767
- No, thanks.
- These are the ones you asked for.

28:36.852 --> 28:39.771
- The Biology notes from Tuesday.
- No, thanks.

28:41.899 --> 28:44.902
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with her, Mary.

28:44.985 --> 28:48.739
Mary? Oh, no, not this
Virgin Mary thing again.

28:48.906 --> 28:50.741
Not virgin. Typhoid.

28:52.744 --> 28:53.745
What?

28:53.828 --> 28:56.539
When we met at the beginning of the year
I didn't like you.

28:56.623 --> 28:58.541
I thought you were some rube
from the sticks.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.710
- I've no patience for rubes.
- How enlightening.

29:00.794 --> 29:02.837
But then I discovered
that you're not so dumb.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.132
You even seemed modestly interesting
at times.

29:05.215 --> 29:06.883
That's when I made a very big mistake.

29:06.967 --> 29:09.344
I let my guard down.
That won't happen again.

29:09.386 --> 29:12.848
- What is this about?
- It's about using people for your own ends.

29:12.932 --> 29:15.392
About making enemies
where you should've made friends.

29:15.476 --> 29:17.853
- How did I make you my enemy?
- I think you know.

29:17.896 --> 29:20.523
Was it setting you up with Tristan?
I'm sorry about that.

29:20.565 --> 29:22.900
- I thought I was just being nice.
- Sure you did.

29:22.943 --> 29:25.695
I helped you get ready.
I loaned you my mother's clothes...

29:25.737 --> 29:28.239
- which I still haven't got back.
- My God, you're right.

29:28.323 --> 29:31.576
Hope Skippy didn't have her puppies
on them. I'll check when I'm home.

29:31.660 --> 29:33.411
Tell me what I did.

29:33.954 --> 29:36.540
- Paris!
- Think about it at P. J. Harvey.

29:36.999 --> 29:39.751
Is that what this is about?
I'm not going to P. J. Harvey.

29:39.836 --> 29:41.963
- Tristan says you are.
- Then he lied.

29:42.046 --> 29:44.548
- I saw the tickets.
- He bought them on his own.

29:44.632 --> 29:46.926
I'm over Tristan.
Don't back out on my account.

29:47.010 --> 29:48.386
There's nothing to back out of.

29:48.428 --> 29:50.638
I don't have time for concerts anyway.

29:50.722 --> 29:53.224
I'm lining up my extracurriculars
for next year.

29:53.308 --> 29:55.894
By the way, are you still going out for
the school paper?

29:55.978 --> 29:57.020
You know, I am.

29:57.104 --> 29:59.564
- You'll need a faculty recommendation.
- I can swing it.

29:59.607 --> 30:02.067
- And the student editor's support.
- I'm not worried.

30:02.109 --> 30:04.152
Worry. I just got the job.

30:07.532 --> 30:09.659
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

30:09.784 --> 30:12.119
And don't worry. You'll have some role.

30:12.162 --> 30:14.873
How's covering
the new parking lot landscaping sound?

30:14.956 --> 30:15.998
Peachy.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.460
Too bad I already filled the slot
for music coverage.

30:18.544 --> 30:20.170
Record reviewing and such.

30:20.254 --> 30:23.257
You'd have been perfect for it.
I gave the job to Louise.

30:23.299 --> 30:24.800
Louise owns two CDs.

30:24.884 --> 30:27.136
Yeah. Well, got to go.

30:32.392 --> 30:34.435
Have a really good summer.

30:41.443 --> 30:43.778
You're annoyingly on time again!

30:47.449 --> 30:49.326
Okay. Stairs, then shoes.

30:57.585 --> 30:59.753
- You're all dressed up.
- I'm going out.

30:59.838 --> 31:03.842
Sorry. I forgot my toolbox,
so I just thought I'd come pick it up.

31:03.925 --> 31:05.551
Yeah, it's right over here.

31:05.635 --> 31:08.012
We couldn't lift it
or we'd have brought it to you.

31:08.055 --> 31:10.641
Then we got used to having it here,
so we named it Bert.

31:10.724 --> 31:13.727
We'd say, 'Good night, Bert,'
and it'd say, 'Good night, girls. '

31:13.811 --> 31:15.312
We spend too much time home alone.

31:15.354 --> 31:18.065
- Thanks for taking care of him.
- Our pleasure.

31:20.651 --> 31:22.236
So, Rachel left.

31:22.654 --> 31:25.031
- What?
- Last night she left for good.

31:25.073 --> 31:27.158
Oh, no, Luke, I'm so sorry.

31:27.867 --> 31:30.619
- What happened?
- It's hard to explain.

31:30.704 --> 31:34.166
I can't believe it. I thought she was in it
for the long haul this time.

31:34.207 --> 31:36.834
Yeah, well, she had her reasons.

31:37.461 --> 31:38.920
Really? What?

31:39.213 --> 31:41.673
Hello. I tried to be late.

31:41.882 --> 31:45.010
And an utter failure at one minute past.

31:47.722 --> 31:49.557
Max Medina, this is Luke Danes.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.310
Luke owns the diner.
He has the greatest coffee.

31:52.394 --> 31:55.355
- Right, I saw you at the town meeting.
- I saw you, too.

31:55.397 --> 31:57.023
Nice to meet you.

31:57.566 --> 31:59.818
- So, we should be going.
- Yeah.

31:59.902 --> 32:01.236
I'm gonna get going.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.448
I just left my toolbox
from when I was here earlier, fixing things.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.908
I do a lot of little things
around here for Lorelai.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.911
Yeah, you're very handy.
So, Luke, we'll talk later.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.205
Yes, we will.

32:11.247 --> 32:14.250
Although probably not tonight.
We won't be back until late.

32:14.292 --> 32:16.878
- No, I meant not tonight.
- Oh, I misunderstood.

32:16.961 --> 32:19.046
I meant tomorrow. So, tomorrow.

32:19.130 --> 32:22.383
Absolutely. We see each other
most every day.

32:22.426 --> 32:25.929
- Sure. You've got the coffee.
- And she needs the coffee.

32:26.013 --> 32:28.307
So I'll see you tomorrow,
same time as always.

32:28.390 --> 32:29.975
I'd count on a little later.

32:30.059 --> 32:33.187
It doesn't matter what time it is.
I'll always be around.

32:35.398 --> 32:36.524
Bye.

32:40.612 --> 32:42.238
So, are we going?

32:42.572 --> 32:44.407
Yeah. Just wanted to make sure...

32:44.449 --> 32:46.617
you two were done
swinging those things around.

32:46.701 --> 32:49.620
- Someone's bound to lose an eye.
- What are you talking about?

32:49.705 --> 32:52.040
Nothing. I'll get my purse.

32:53.959 --> 32:56.586
So, not to be blunt, but is that over?

32:57.421 --> 33:00.090
- Is what over?
- Whatever I just walked in on.

33:00.132 --> 33:02.467
Max, come on, that's Luke.

33:02.510 --> 33:04.011
I picked something up there.

33:04.095 --> 33:06.681
Drop it back on the ground,
kick it under the couch...

33:06.764 --> 33:08.724
because there is no 'there' there.

33:08.850 --> 33:10.059
Hey, it's okay.

33:10.143 --> 33:13.479
We were apart for quite a while.
I never assumed you joined a convent.

33:13.855 --> 33:16.441
It's not like I didn't date
while we were apart.

33:17.151 --> 33:18.986
- You dated?
- A little.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.448
- A little person?
- No, I dated a little.

33:23.157 --> 33:26.702
Okay. I didn't expect you
to join a manvent...

33:26.786 --> 33:29.288
or whatever the male equivalent
of that is called.

33:29.372 --> 33:31.415
- Who did you date?
- A monastery.

33:31.499 --> 33:32.875
You dated a monastery?

33:32.959 --> 33:35.127
A monastery is
the male equivalent of a convent.

33:35.211 --> 33:37.171
I'll make a note for the quiz on Friday.

33:37.255 --> 33:39.006
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

33:39.091 --> 33:43.387
I get it. Yes, we were apart.
And I didn't exactly remain inactive.

33:43.470 --> 33:45.889
- So you did date Luke?
- No, I did not date Luke.

33:45.973 --> 33:47.975
- You can tell me.
- I did not date Luke.

33:48.058 --> 33:50.268
- There was a vibe.
- There was no vibe.

33:50.353 --> 33:53.147
What's with the questioning?
You won't tell me who you dated.

33:53.189 --> 33:54.315
No one you know.

33:54.357 --> 33:56.984
Did you date casual, nothing-type dating...

33:57.026 --> 34:00.446
or did you date get-down, soul-train
kind of a dating?

34:00.864 --> 34:04.075
I wouldn't phrase it that way,
but to be honest, it was the latter.

34:04.159 --> 34:06.369
Good. Well, I like your honesty...

34:06.453 --> 34:09.915
because you could've lied and
left that part out to spare my feelings...

34:09.998 --> 34:12.293
which would've been unnecessary.
So, thank you.

34:12.376 --> 34:13.752
I slept with Rory's dad.

34:13.835 --> 34:16.004
- Change the subject.
- On my parents' balcony.

34:16.047 --> 34:18.299
- I want to change the subject.
- You started it.

34:18.382 --> 34:21.426
I did not mean for this to become
a who-slept-with-whom contest.

34:21.511 --> 34:23.513
- How'd it get that way?
- I don't know.

34:23.554 --> 34:27.516
Why do we let it get weird between us
just when it's getting good again?

34:27.601 --> 34:28.685
I don't know.

34:28.726 --> 34:30.562
- I don't like it.
- I don't either.

34:30.603 --> 34:32.397
- And I'm sick of it.
- So am I.

34:32.438 --> 34:35.859
We can't keep getting this close
to have something derail us again.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.862
There's only one thing I could think of
that could solve it.

34:38.904 --> 34:42.532
Break up. I'm not interested
in a murder-suicide kind of thing.

34:42.574 --> 34:44.452
We should get married.

34:47.246 --> 34:49.916
Give me a clue
as to whether you're kidding or not.

34:49.998 --> 34:51.667
I am not kidding.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.129
- Good clue.
- What do you say?

34:55.880 --> 34:59.259
Nothing. Max, you did not
just propose to me.

34:59.343 --> 35:00.510
Yes, I did.

35:00.594 --> 35:03.597
No. A proposal has to be
something more...

35:03.681 --> 35:06.433
than the desperate desire
to end a bickering match.

35:06.475 --> 35:09.311
- It was more than that.
- It has to be planned.

35:09.395 --> 35:11.313
It should be magical.

35:11.397 --> 35:14.942
There should be music playing,
and romantic lighting...

35:15.026 --> 35:19.363
and a subtle buildup
to the popping of the big question.

35:19.656 --> 35:22.534
There should be
a thousand yellow daisies...

35:22.701 --> 35:26.246
and candles and a horse.
I don't know what a horse is doing there...

35:26.288 --> 35:28.874
unless you're riding it,
which is a little over the top.

35:28.958 --> 35:31.085
It should be more than this.

35:33.296 --> 35:34.797
You're right.

35:35.048 --> 35:36.424
I am right.

35:37.467 --> 35:39.552
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

35:44.516 --> 35:46.601
Let's start the evening over.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.062
Ding-dong.

35:50.981 --> 35:54.568
- Now I'm five minutes late.
- You're making good progress.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.282
Let's go?

36:07.916 --> 36:09.459
Bye-bye, Bert.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.471
- I'm a little tired of this game.
- What game?

36:21.555 --> 36:23.890
- Are we meeting there?
- What are you talking about?

36:23.975 --> 36:24.976
The concert's tonight.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.311
Hope you and the empty seat
have a lot of fun.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.772
- I'm starting to get a little irritated.
- So am I.

36:29.856 --> 36:30.982
What are you mad about?

36:31.066 --> 36:33.068
You're telling everyone I'm going with you.

36:33.151 --> 36:34.485
- Just a couple.
- You told Paris.

36:34.528 --> 36:37.489
Paris and I had just started getting along.
Now she hates me.

36:37.531 --> 36:40.158
If the damage is done,
you might as well come with me.

36:40.200 --> 36:43.536
Never. I am never going
anywhere with you, ever.

36:43.746 --> 36:47.041
- These tickets cost me a fortune.
- They cost your daddy a fortune.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.585
I don't know anyone else
who's into this stupid guy.

36:49.669 --> 36:51.295
P. J. Harvey's a woman.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.464
What are you doing?

36:53.548 --> 36:55.550
You'll get them back when you agree.

36:55.633 --> 36:58.677
You're pathetic, Tristan.
Keep the books. I'm leaving.

37:02.891 --> 37:03.975
Dean?

37:08.230 --> 37:09.940
What are you doing here?

37:10.357 --> 37:11.942
- I'm leaving.
- Don't go.

37:12.026 --> 37:13.694
- I shouldn't have come.
- Wait!

37:13.736 --> 37:15.237
- I feel like an idiot.
- Why?

37:15.279 --> 37:18.574
I come all the way out here,
and I see you with him. It's just great.

37:18.658 --> 37:20.576
- No, Tristan was just...
- I don't care.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.078
He's got your books.

37:22.162 --> 37:23.955
He took them.
He wouldn't give them back.

37:24.039 --> 37:25.874
Please, just tell me why you're here.

37:26.083 --> 37:28.085
- I don't even know.
- Yes, you do.

37:29.127 --> 37:30.920
'Cause I thought you...

37:31.004 --> 37:32.422
- Forget it.
- No, say it.

37:32.506 --> 37:35.842
I thought you were trying to talk to me.
You came to my house.

37:35.926 --> 37:37.469
- That wasn't me.
- It was you.

37:37.553 --> 37:39.555
It must've been someone
that looked like me.

37:39.639 --> 37:42.058
My sister recognized you
from the pictures in my box.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.518
In what box?

37:43.601 --> 37:48.022
The box of stuff I have of us, pictures,
and letters, and everything from you.

37:48.106 --> 37:49.524
You have a Rory box?

37:49.608 --> 37:52.694
What about the town meeting?
All that stuff about writing a song?

37:52.778 --> 37:54.112
I don't know what I was saying.

37:54.196 --> 37:56.156
That had nothing to do with me?

37:57.491 --> 37:59.910
I must have imagined it all then.

38:03.289 --> 38:05.541
- Your boyfriend's waiting.
- He's not my boyfriend.

38:05.625 --> 38:07.084
- I hate him.
- Whatever.

38:07.126 --> 38:08.419
- Dean.
- What?

38:08.461 --> 38:09.879
- Stop!
- Why?

38:11.798 --> 38:14.050
Because I love you, you idiot.

38:45.626 --> 38:48.629
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you speak English?

38:48.712 --> 38:49.963
Are you listening to me?

38:50.005 --> 38:52.674
- What took you?
- Sorry. I got here as quickly as I could.

38:52.758 --> 38:55.594
- Do not address him. He's a scoundrel.
- I'm just doing my job.

38:55.678 --> 38:58.305
Am I not the head man
in charge of floral deliveries?

38:58.389 --> 39:01.058
And one of the few men
who would proudly declare that.

39:01.142 --> 39:02.893
- I'm doing my job.
- Stop saying that.

39:02.977 --> 39:06.105
- This has to do with flowers we ordered?
- Flowers we did not order.

39:06.189 --> 39:07.190
I'm just doing my job.

39:07.274 --> 39:09.192
Say that once more
and I'll punch your nose.

39:09.234 --> 39:10.568
- It must be a mistake.
- No.

39:10.652 --> 39:12.111
I did not order these flowers.

39:12.196 --> 39:14.948
It says that you have to be here
to personally accept them.

39:15.032 --> 39:17.492
I have to be here? Well, that's...

39:17.743 --> 39:20.579
- I am head man in charge of flowers.
- I just do what I'm told.

39:20.663 --> 39:23.332
- I warn you not to say that.
- It's not what I said before.

39:23.374 --> 39:27.086
It's a little variation
that will still lead to a punch on the nose.

39:33.844 --> 39:35.804
Daisies, no less.

39:35.888 --> 39:38.974
As if I would order
these pitiful little things.

39:39.224 --> 39:42.727
Foul things, these daisies.
Just a notch up from weeds.

39:43.104 --> 39:45.314
And look how many.
There must be at least...

39:45.398 --> 39:48.651
A thousand of them.
A thousand yellow daisies.

39:49.485 --> 39:52.112
That's right,
there's exactly a thousand of them.

39:52.197 --> 39:54.866
Order states that
there's to be exactly a thousand.

39:54.950 --> 39:57.869
Not 1,001, not 999, but 1,000.

39:57.911 --> 40:00.246
You ask for 1,000, I bring 1,000.

40:00.330 --> 40:02.457
I don't question the orders.
I merely fill them.

40:02.541 --> 40:05.127
A job well done, Mr. Adolph Eichmann.

40:31.155 --> 40:32.614
I couldn't find a horse.

40:32.656 --> 40:34.908
- You didn't have to...
- Don't say anything.

40:34.950 --> 40:36.284
Please.

40:36.619 --> 40:40.915
You were right last night.
I shouldn't have proposed to you like that.

40:41.541 --> 40:42.667
It was stupid.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.918
It was the wrong place
and the wrong time.

40:45.003 --> 40:47.463
I kicked myself the entire night
for doing it.

40:47.506 --> 40:49.966
But you were wrong about something, too.

40:50.050 --> 40:52.510
I didn't propose to you
because we were fighting.

40:52.594 --> 40:54.387
I proposed because I love you.

40:54.722 --> 40:57.600
We're in a bad pattern, Lorelai,
and we have to break it.

40:57.641 --> 41:01.436
And other than that murder-suicide thing,
which would be illegal and messy...

41:01.479 --> 41:03.105
I can only think to be impetuous.

41:03.773 --> 41:06.859
No, listen. I woke up this morning...

41:06.943 --> 41:08.486
and I realized...

41:08.570 --> 41:12.532
that I have studied
and taught the great literature all my life.

41:12.699 --> 41:17.078
And those stories are replete with
characters that let opportunities slip by.

41:17.496 --> 41:20.123
But what I teach
is more than just literature.

41:20.207 --> 41:21.541
It's lessons in life.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.502
If I don't follow those tenets...

41:23.586 --> 41:26.839
I'm not the man I thought I was,
the man I want to be.

41:27.298 --> 41:29.216
God, you talk so good.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.759
I don't want an answer now.

41:30.843 --> 41:33.887
I've thought about this.
I want you to do the same.

41:34.389 --> 41:36.474
I love you, Lorelai Gilmore.

41:37.392 --> 41:39.352
And I know this to be true.

41:40.729 --> 41:42.314
I'll talk to you later.

41:51.198 --> 41:52.407
Oh, my.

42:26.569 --> 42:28.904
- Rory!
- You made me spill.

42:28.989 --> 42:31.533
- Sorry. She's not here?
- No. What's the matter?

42:31.575 --> 42:34.661
I messaged her to meet me here at 7:00.
She's supposed to be here.

42:34.745 --> 42:35.829
- So what time is it?
- 7:00.

42:35.913 --> 42:37.956
- I'm damp.
- Where is she?

42:38.040 --> 42:40.042
Calm down. Is everything okay?

42:40.126 --> 42:43.212
- Yes. Maybe. I think so. I don't know.
- What's going on?

42:43.254 --> 42:46.215
Big things,
potentially life-changing things.

42:46.257 --> 42:47.341
Get a promotion?

42:47.425 --> 42:49.552
I became head salesman
of Northwest Territories.

42:49.594 --> 42:51.721
I run an inn.
There's no place to promote me to.

42:51.763 --> 42:52.805
So it's not work.

42:52.889 --> 42:54.932
- Where's she?
- Have some coffee while you wait.

42:55.016 --> 42:57.852
I couldn't take coffee.
Big hole through the roof, very bad.

42:57.936 --> 43:00.146
You're saying no to coffee? This is big.

43:00.355 --> 43:01.564
Can't tell me what it is?

43:01.607 --> 43:03.984
I just really need to tell Rory first.

43:04.068 --> 43:06.779
But you're happy about this news?

43:07.822 --> 43:10.199
I might be. Maybe.

43:11.576 --> 43:14.871
It's like a,
'I can't believe this is happening to me'...

43:14.954 --> 43:16.539
kind of a mind-blowing moment.

43:16.623 --> 43:19.292
There she is. I'm gonna go.

43:22.129 --> 43:24.339
The whole town gets one today.

43:27.635 --> 43:28.761
Bye.

43:48.365 --> 43:49.991
- He just...
- I just...

43:50.075 --> 43:51.409
You first!

43:52.620 --> 43:53.913
Me first!
