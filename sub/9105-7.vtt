<i>He's the head of security
at the Russian mining town,</i>

00:19.269 --> 00:21.271

19:58.823 --> 20:00.416
I want to come home.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.167
Let me know
where you're calling from.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.828
I don't know.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.667
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

20:05.830 --> 20:08.333
What are you doing?
Hello?

20:08.499 --> 20:12.299
Ronnie? It's Ingrid,
Fortitude Police.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.963
Go and wait by the Ski-Doo.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.386
We know you didn't hurt
Professor Stoddart.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.895
Your little girl
wants to come home,

20:21.053 --> 20:22.555
and you need to
think clearly now.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.065
You need to make good decisions.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.566
I can. I do that.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.477
I make good decisions.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.486
Then bring Carrie back
to Fortitude,

20:29.645 --> 20:31.693
and we will sort this out.

20:31.856 --> 20:32.948
I give you my word.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.450
You can't give me that.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.452
So we're going.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.911
You won't stop us.
You won't take her away from me.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.624
Don't ever do that
to me again, all right?

20:45.786 --> 20:46.958
'Cause I do this for you.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.715
All of it's for you.

All we'll be doing

is talking.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.995
What's the matter?

22:48.158 --> 22:50.206
Do you really think I'd bring
the Fortitude cops here

22:50.369 --> 22:51.621

22:51.787 --> 22:55.917
This is between

22:56.083 --> 22:59.383
So let's begin with the evidence
that you stole from my room.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.477
I said

23:06.635 --> 23:08.137
I just want to talk.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.817
You knew I'd come, didn't you?

23:13.976 --> 23:15.478
You'd thought about it.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.146
Yeah.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.031
I thought about it.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.152
So fuck you.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.496
I know who killed
Billy Pettigrew.

23:29.658 --> 23:33.162
So we'll do a deal.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.047
And I'll be keeping

Dan.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.263
Would you like a drink?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.102
I'm looking for DCI Morton.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.766
He seems to have disappeared.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.856
Really?!

23:56.018 --> 23:58.612
I want you to tell me where he is.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.614
How the fuck would I know that?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.616
Because
you brought him here.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.745
What are you talking about?

24:05.903 --> 24:09.453
You used that phone,
and you called London.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.078
You told him
I murdered Stoddart.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.667
Just as I murdered Pettigrew.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.582
I told you

24:18.749 --> 24:21.252
about my feelings for Elena.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.840
I trusted you with that.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.472
The same day, Morton brings her
in for questioning.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.053
Threatens
to ruin her whole life.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.059
Just to get at me.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.266
No, that's not right.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.395
I trusted you, Henry.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.067
I let you stay on this island
so you could die well.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.274
I wanted to be there for you.

24:39.436 --> 24:42.064
So tell me,

24:42.231 --> 24:44.575
where's Morton?

24:44.733 --> 24:48.408
All I did was make the call
and nothing else.

24:48.570 --> 24:53.201
What the fuck have I done...?

24:58.122 --> 25:00.375
I don't know.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.721
<i>You didn't actually see</i>

25:06.880 --> 25:10.475
Eric Odegard put Billy Pettigrew
into the police car.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.477
I didn't have to.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.479
He disappeared.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.892
The next day they're pulling
his carcass off that beach.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.311
See, what you're giving me here

25:20.477 --> 25:22.400
is circumstantial evidence.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.112
I think I will be taking
that printout back with me.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.265
I found that on the beach
where Pettigrew was killed.

25:49.423 --> 25:53.849
The bullet came from
a .375 hunting rifle.

25:54.011 --> 25:56.480
Standard Fortitude police issue.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.977
Hmm, hmm?

26:01.143 --> 26:04.613
Do the ballistics
on Eric Odegard's rifle.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.241
That's his slug
I found on the beach.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.945
Why not another cop?

26:11.111 --> 26:13.830
Oh, they're all in it.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.957
They're all covering for Eric.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.914
Sheriff Anderssen, too?

26:18.077 --> 26:21.832
He carries around photos
of Pettigrew's body parts.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.920
He tried to scare me with them.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.336
Why would he scare you?

26:26.502 --> 26:28.379
I said he tried.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.680
I've given you plenty.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.602
You can go now.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.115
Eric killed Pettigrew

26:52.277 --> 26:54.120
for that printout, okay?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.872
But that's mine now.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.125
And I get the Fortitude police
off your back

26:58.283 --> 26:59.751
if I nail Eric, right?

26:59.910 --> 27:01.332
Sounds like a deal.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.917
Sounds like paranoia.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.474
Aren't you curious...

27:33.610 --> 27:36.363
