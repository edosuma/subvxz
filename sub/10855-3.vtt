WEBVTT

00:03.376 --> 00:05.938
We've got to ring the police.
We're going to go to the police

00:05.939 --> 00:06.942
after we've got her back.

00:06.943 --> 00:08.870
Well, it's not mine.

00:08.871 --> 00:09.890
Hands behind your back.

00:09.891 --> 00:11.910
I'm not your mother.
Nobody bullies you.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.850
You're a police officer.

00:13.851 --> 00:14.894
I did this stupid thing.

00:14.895 --> 00:16.563
You never finished telling me
your story.

00:16.580 --> 00:17.651
It wasn't... really a police matter.

00:17.652 --> 00:20.615
Why have I just had police
knocking on door?

00:20.616 --> 00:22.619
Just get her ready to shift her.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.623
Where are we taking her?
I don't know yet.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.608
Just ring me
as soon as you're on the move.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.685
Becky, my daughter...

00:28.686 --> 00:30.757
died just after Ryan was born.

00:30.758 --> 00:32.680
She was raped.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.673
Is that what you're going to
do - mark his card for him?

00:34.674 --> 00:36.710
My intention is to deal with it
effectively.

00:49.865 --> 00:50.901
You are kidding me?!

00:52.011 --> 00:53.449
'I'm not.'

00:53.450 --> 00:55.453
You're lying.
'Nope.'

00:55.454 --> 00:57.497
That's disgusting!

00:57.498 --> 00:59.481
They don't call it animal husbandry
for nothing.

00:59.482 --> 01:01.449
Why d'you think
they wear wellies - farmers?

01:01.450 --> 01:03.453
Forget the mud. It's to slot
the sheep's hind legs down

01:03.454 --> 01:05.441
'and keep 'em rigid...'
It is not!

01:05.441 --> 01:06.497
..while you're giving 'em one
up the bee-hind.

01:06.498 --> 01:08.473
Shut... up!

01:08.474 --> 01:11.437
Do you not know anything about the
countryside? Do you honestly think

01:11.438 --> 01:14.421
they'd waste time legislating against
it if it didn't really happen?

01:14.422 --> 01:16.437
I have to say, Mr Kershaw was

01:16.438 --> 01:19.493
unusually upset about being told one
of his sheep had been knocked down

01:19.494 --> 01:21.445
at side of road.
They always are!

01:21.446 --> 01:23.465
I'm telling you,
it's a very special relationship

01:23.466 --> 01:25.489
these farmers have
with their sheep.

01:25.490 --> 01:27.461
Draw your own conclusions.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.429
I suppose I'm attracted to Ollie
and he's a bit of a beast.

01:30.430 --> 01:33.429
'Well, there you go, you see.
I rest my case.'

01:33.430 --> 01:34.481
If you didn't want to see the funny
side,

01:34.482 --> 01:36.457
you shouldn't have joined
the police force...

01:36.458 --> 01:38.442
service... force.

01:48.438 --> 01:50.441
Oooh! Gotta go.

01:50.442 --> 01:53.405
Jenson Button's just streaked past
in a white tranny.

01:53.406 --> 01:55.926
'I think he's trying to smash
the land speed record, bless him.'

01:56.498 --> 01:59.449
And he's got a tail-light out.

01:59.450 --> 02:00.477
I think I might give him a tug.

02:00.478 --> 02:03.461
'OK, well, you be careful
and don't be long.'

02:03.462 --> 02:05.477
I wanna send everyone home
in ten minutes.

02:05.478 --> 02:07.474
I wanna go home in ten minutes.

02:39.228 --> 02:42.764
Bravo November 9512, can you PNC
a vehicle for me, please?

02:42.764 --> 02:45.719
'We're just changing shifts, 9512.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.728
'Can you give us two minutes?'
OK, thanks.

02:54.748 --> 02:55.752
Shit!

03:37.736 --> 03:39.743
Bravo November 9512?

03:39.744 --> 03:43.711
'Nearly with you, 9512. Just give us
a minute. He' gone to the toilet.'

03:43.712 --> 03:44.724
Forget it.

04:02.696 --> 04:03.699
Evening.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.683
Is this your van?
Yeah.

04:05.684 --> 04:06.763
You were going at quite a lick
there.

04:06.764 --> 04:08.719
Yeah. Sorry.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.687
I've... I've had bit of a long day,
I just want to get home to girlfriend.

04:12.688 --> 04:14.703
Sure. What you done to your face?

04:14.704 --> 04:16.666
I had a fight...

04:16.668 --> 04:18.724
wi... with me brother.
Can I see your docs?

04:19.728 --> 04:21.738
I've... not...

04:21.740 --> 04:23.695
I haven't got anything on me.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.723
Do you know where they are?
They're in drawer at home.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.748
OK. What's your name?

04:28.668 --> 04:29.763
Lewis Whippey.

04:29.764 --> 04:32.715
You've got a light out at the back,
Lewis. Did you know?

04:32.716 --> 04:34.743
No. Driver's side.
Come and have a look.

04:34.744 --> 04:37.695
No, I'll...
I'll take your word for it

04:37.696 --> 04:39.727
and I'll get it seen to.
OK.

04:39.728 --> 04:41.715
I just want you to come
and look at how dangerous it is,

04:41.716 --> 04:43.704
particularly on your off-side.
D'you mind?

05:03.692 --> 05:05.687
You see?

05:05.688 --> 05:06.707
Yeah.

05:06.708 --> 05:08.679
You all right?

05:08.680 --> 05:12.683
Yeah, I think... I think I might be
coming down with something like flu.

05:12.684 --> 05:13.755
All right, well, drive safe, OK?

05:13.756 --> 05:15.755
And get that seen to. Yeah? Soon.

05:15.756 --> 05:17.743
Otherwise you're going to
cause an accident

05:17.744 --> 05:19.695
and you just don't need
that sort of hassle, do you?

05:19.696 --> 05:21.764
No. Yeah. Thanks. Sorry.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.763
What you got in there? An elephant?

05:26.764 --> 05:29.732
No, it's just... my dog.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.668
What sort is it?

05:33.720 --> 05:34.723
Labrador.

05:34.724 --> 05:36.756
Nice. What's he called?
Tommy.

05:40.764 --> 05:42.683
I'd like to see inside the van.

05:42.684 --> 05:43.748
It's locked.

05:46.692 --> 05:47.755
Where are the keys?

05:47.756 --> 05:49.676
It's just a dog.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.755
I'd like you to open the van, Lewis.
Where are the keys?

05:54.756 --> 05:56.731
Er, he'll go mad.
He'll run across moors

05:56.732 --> 05:57.853
and I'll never get him back!

06:05.680 --> 06:07.699
Are they in the ignition?

06:07.700 --> 06:08.744
OK, wait there.

06:22.740 --> 06:23.755
Do you know that person?

06:23.756 --> 06:25.675
No.

06:25.676 --> 06:26.876
Right, open it for me, please.

06:44.716 --> 06:46.716
I think they've killed me.

06:52.744 --> 06:53.759
'Control to all units.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.759
'Officer required
to Scammonden Road, Ripponden.'

06:55.760 --> 06:58.711
Bravo November 45, responding.

06:58.712 --> 07:00.739
Go out for a drink,
Sergeant Kirsten shows up...

07:00.740 --> 07:04.716
We've got a code zero,
Scammonden Road, it's Kirsten.

07:06.748 --> 07:09.679
Bravo November 45.
Have you called an ambulance?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.743
Shafiq, you come wi' me,
Twiggy, take the other car.

07:11.744 --> 07:13.687
'Ambulance is on its way, 45.'

07:13.688 --> 07:14.692
What's happened?

07:28.740 --> 07:29.760
Where are the keys?

07:30.764 --> 07:32.687
Right, well, go.

07:32.688 --> 07:33.691
You've...!
Go.

07:33.692 --> 07:35.695
Get that van off this road fast.

07:35.696 --> 07:37.700
Like your arse is on fire.

07:38.704 --> 07:40.711
Y-You...!

07:40.712 --> 07:41.760
Nutter!

08:34.736 --> 08:37.696
She'd seen a white tranny with a
light out, she was going to...

08:38.700 --> 08:41.722
Bravo November 45. Had she just PNC'd
a white transit van?

08:41.724 --> 08:43.759
'She'd put in a request
but not given the registration.'

08:43.760 --> 08:45.687
Why would she do that?

08:45.688 --> 08:49.728
I want the helicopter up now, now,
now, looking for a white transit van.

09:32.752 --> 09:34.692
Pass me the...

09:59.760 --> 10:01.711
What is there?

10:01.712 --> 10:02.716
Sarg?

10:03.716 --> 10:04.728
What's happening?

10:14.732 --> 10:15.764
Kirsten?

10:34.668 --> 10:35.739
We need to close the road.

10:35.740 --> 10:39.759
Bravo November 45 to Control,
she's, er, she's dead.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.668
Looks like she's been knocked down.

10:43.764 --> 10:47.747
We need the on-call DI, we need CSI,
we need the CIU, we need H-MIT.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.683
We need... We need the whole circus
here.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.715
Shafiq, take the Landy down as far as
Wheatcroft Lane and park broadside.

10:53.716 --> 10:55.739
Nobody comes through.
Twiggy, same up at the top.

10:55.740 --> 10:58.687
Control, did you get me that
helicopter?

10:58.688 --> 11:00.708
'Helicopter's airborne and en
route.'

11:02.700 --> 11:06.680
Move it, come on, close the road.
We're preserving evidence now.

11:34.672 --> 11:40.668
I had to... give her a bit of a
talking to yesterday morning.

11:43.764 --> 11:48.671
I said, "I'm not your mother. You're
a police officer, nobody bullies you."

11:48.672 --> 11:49.952
She'd be out to prove something.

11:51.668 --> 11:55.727
She said, "This is all I wanted
all my life and I'm shit at it,"

11:55.728 --> 11:58.679
and I should've said, "No, you're
not. You're fantastic, you're lovely,"

11:58.680 --> 12:01.667
but I didn't, I just let her dwell on
it, so she'd be thinking I'd be thinking

12:01.668 --> 12:04.680
that she was shit at it and I didn't.
I don't think that. She wasn't.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.704
Catherine, go home.
You've done all you can.

12:14.708 --> 12:16.696
Who's telling the next of kin, sir?

12:17.704 --> 12:18.711
Is it you?

12:18.712 --> 12:20.731
Yes, that's...

12:20.732 --> 12:23.676
I need your trousers
and your boots as well.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.680
Do you want me to come with you?

12:29.680 --> 12:31.700
Who is the next of kin?

12:34.756 --> 12:38.684
Is there somebody we can ring
to come and be with you, Ollie?

12:41.740 --> 12:43.691
Oh my God!

12:43.692 --> 12:44.748
Carolyn and Ian!

12:45.756 --> 12:46.764
Sorry, who?

12:48.740 --> 12:50.732
Er, it's Kirsten's mum and dad.

12:52.668 --> 12:54.676
Do you want to tell Carolyn and Ian
or...

12:56.724 --> 12:58.744
..is it something you'd like me to
do?

13:00.688 --> 13:01.744
Can you do it?

13:15.684 --> 13:17.687
Where do the parents live?

13:17.688 --> 13:19.687
Er, five minutes away.

13:19.688 --> 13:20.715
Where's your car?

13:20.716 --> 13:22.667
At the nick.

13:22.668 --> 13:25.723
Right, well, we'll visit the parents
then I'm dropping you off at the nick

13:25.724 --> 13:27.683
and then you're going home.

13:27.684 --> 13:29.716
You've got to let
other people do their jobs now.

13:31.692 --> 13:34.755
I've got to write a duty statement.
The SIO'll need it.

13:34.756 --> 13:36.704
And then you're going home.

13:44.744 --> 13:46.672
Oh, and...

13:47.744 --> 13:50.699
..you arrested Marcus Gascoigne
yesterday.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.723
Yeah.

13:51.724 --> 13:53.728
Do you think you might've made a
mistake?

13:54.736 --> 13:57.679
No, sir. There was a packet
of what appeared to be cocaine

13:57.680 --> 13:59.687
slipped under the front seat of his
car.

13:59.688 --> 14:01.723
He refused to be breathalysed
and he stank like a brewery.

14:01.724 --> 14:04.759
Yeah, what I meant was...
he does a lot for us.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.680
On the council.

14:09.668 --> 14:10.672
How big was this packet?

14:11.692 --> 14:12.699
Tiny.

14:12.700 --> 14:13.728
Personal use.

14:14.764 --> 14:17.667
I'm sure he's had his fingers
burned,

14:17.668 --> 14:19.683
so I'm just asking you to
consider...

14:19.684 --> 14:21.676
the implications...

14:22.680 --> 14:24.680
..before you take it any further.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.723
Well, it, it depends
what comes back from the lab.

14:27.724 --> 14:29.675
Has it gone to the lab?

14:29.676 --> 14:31.763
No, it's gone into the store
up at Halifax to have a field test.

14:31.764 --> 14:33.668
Take it out.

14:36.716 --> 14:37.759
I-I can't do that.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.716
Well...

14:40.728 --> 14:42.732
..do something.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.692
You should try and get some sleep.

14:59.740 --> 15:03.707
What could a man, men, people -
they, she said "they".

15:03.708 --> 15:04.739
"They've killed me."

15:04.740 --> 15:07.763
What could they be doing in a van,
with a van, that was so bad

15:07.764 --> 15:10.696
that they had to kill a police
officer? A kid.

15:12.728 --> 15:15.763
What had she stumbled across?

15:15.764 --> 15:18.719
It's going to be tough few days.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.748
It's going to be a tough few weeks.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.731
And I know from what Catherine's
told me

15:24.732 --> 15:27.747
that no officer could be more well
loved,

15:27.748 --> 15:30.692
more well respected, than Kirsten.

15:31.692 --> 15:32.813
And what I want to say is...

15:33.728 --> 15:35.720
..we are here for you.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.672
Don't be too proud or too shy.

15:40.672 --> 15:43.716
My door is always open, Inspector
Taylor's door's always open.

15:44.752 --> 15:46.759
Catherine's door's always open.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.707
If you want to talk to the doctor,
you know where he is.

15:49.708 --> 15:52.724
If you want to talk to the chaplain,
you know where he is.

15:53.748 --> 15:57.751
It might not sink in today, it might
not sink in till the funeral

15:57.752 --> 15:59.719
Becky?

15:59.720 --> 16:03.667
It might be six months before it
sinks in.

16:03.668 --> 16:06.680
But if at any time
you feel you're not coping...

16:08.764 --> 16:11.700
Please don't keep it
to yourself.

16:19.728 --> 16:23.699
I have no shadow of a doubt
that our colleagues in H-MIT

16:23.700 --> 16:27.687
will move heaven and earth
to find out who was responsible.

16:27.688 --> 16:29.675
Catherine.

16:29.676 --> 16:30.752
Sir.

16:43.692 --> 16:44.704
Er...

16:45.712 --> 16:46.759
OK. You heard him.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.736
We have to... get out there
and do what we do best.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.707
Be patient with people.

16:55.708 --> 16:59.716
Everything that you deal with today
is going to seem so trivial...

17:00.756 --> 17:04.727
..but to everyone out there, if they've
had to call the police, it's a big deal

17:04.728 --> 17:07.742
so, whatever's going on in your head,

17:07.743 --> 17:10.715
you treat people with the compassion
and respect they deserve.

17:12.743 --> 17:14.675
At the same time,

17:14.675 --> 17:16.703
I want you with your stab-proof vests
on,

17:16.704 --> 17:18.675
I want you with your batons,

17:18.675 --> 17:19.747
I want you with your CS gas

17:19.748 --> 17:22.759
because sometimes it's easy to forget
that we put our lives on the line

17:22.760 --> 17:24.727
every time we go out there.

17:24.728 --> 17:26.684
So you look after yourselves.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.679
And keep in touch.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.732
For God's sake, keep in touch
with me and with each other.

17:34.732 --> 17:35.744
Go on.

17:40.752 --> 17:41.755
Sarg?

17:41.756 --> 17:44.743
Do you want me to help out with that
lad that's being sectioned this morning?

17:44.744 --> 17:46.667
Oh, yeah.

17:46.668 --> 17:47.724
Thanks.
OK.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.711
Owen Brierley will crush both
vehicles.

18:47.712 --> 18:50.691
One of you stays here with her,
the other one takes the Mini,

18:50.692 --> 18:53.667
gets back here,
then takes the van with her in it,

18:53.668 --> 18:55.687
dumps her somewhere, middle of
nowhere,

18:55.688 --> 18:57.667
then takes the van to Owen. Finito.

18:57.668 --> 18:59.751
Dumps her in the middle of nowhere?
Dead?

18:59.752 --> 19:02.679
No, not dead!

19:02.680 --> 19:04.691
You... chump!

19:04.692 --> 19:06.683
You've done enough damage.

19:06.684 --> 19:08.691
We're going to get hung,
drawn and quartered,

19:08.692 --> 19:11.695
we're going to be thrown to the
lions, we're going to be crucified.

19:11.696 --> 19:14.703
Upside down. In public!

19:14.704 --> 19:15.756
You... wanker!

19:17.712 --> 19:19.719
Two things.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.707
Three things.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.667
I have not come this far,

19:23.668 --> 19:26.679
I have not spent the last three days
doing all the shit I've been doing

19:26.680 --> 19:28.759
to get so little out of it.
That's one.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.691
Two - she knows too much.

19:31.692 --> 19:35.755
She heard him, shit-for-brains,
talk about "ringing Ashley up at t'farm".

19:35.756 --> 19:40.739
And then last night he told the little
police officer his name, his own name,

19:40.740 --> 19:44.763
and she, rich bitch, was two feet
away from him in back of van, so...

19:44.764 --> 19:46.747
How d'you know?

19:46.748 --> 19:48.704
He told me.

19:52.676 --> 19:53.720
What was the third thing?

19:54.724 --> 19:55.732
Oh, yeah.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.751
We don't call me a wanker.

19:58.752 --> 20:01.759
She's staying here, you're ringing
Nev.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.743
Telling him we want a hundred grand
this time, right?

20:04.744 --> 20:06.715
And then... well, we'll see.

20:06.716 --> 20:09.704
They're onto us! You idiot.

20:10.748 --> 20:13.671
Why was she following you last night?

20:13.672 --> 20:15.739
The copper. Why did that other one
turn up at the house?

20:15.740 --> 20:17.723
I don't think they are.
She wasn't following him.

20:17.724 --> 20:19.759
She stopped him cos he had a light
out.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.719
And that other one at the house?
If they knew what we were up to,

20:22.720 --> 20:23.751
there'd have been 15 of 'em.

20:23.752 --> 20:25.740
They'd have kicked door down.

20:26.752 --> 20:28.712
OK.

20:29.736 --> 20:30.735
So who's staying here

20:30.736 --> 20:32.743
and who's taking the Mini?
He can stay here.

20:32.744 --> 20:36.711
He's shitting bricks.
He'll be useless out there.

20:36.712 --> 20:37.720
I'll tell him.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.735
Have you finished?
I've finished.

20:49.736 --> 20:52.719
Right, well, can you both
go and brush your teeth, please?

20:52.720 --> 20:53.724
All right!

20:59.692 --> 21:00.712
What's the matter?

21:03.732 --> 21:07.759
He made me take some of the money.
Ashley. Yesterday.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.735
He split it up. He gave me £2,000
in a bag. And what could I do?

21:11.736 --> 21:13.743
I couldn't say "No thanks",
he'd have been suspicious.

21:13.744 --> 21:15.680
I couldn't just...
So what did you do with it?

21:16.740 --> 21:17.743
It's in the car.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.723
In the car?!

21:19.724 --> 21:24.751
Under the... In with the spare
wheel. It's hidden. I...

21:24.752 --> 21:26.683
I don't know what to do with it.

21:26.684 --> 21:27.715
Destroy it. Burn it.

21:27.716 --> 21:28.723
No!

21:28.724 --> 21:30.699
It's money.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.703
Leave it somewhere.
No.

21:32.704 --> 21:34.743
Don't bring it in the house.
I'm not going to!

21:34.744 --> 21:37.723
Put it in a bin.
Are your fingerprints on it?

21:37.724 --> 21:38.747
No.

21:38.748 --> 21:40.747
On the bag?
I'm ready!

21:40.748 --> 21:42.708
That was quick.

21:43.728 --> 21:45.667
What's in those sandwiches?

21:45.668 --> 21:46.687
Tuna mayonnaise.

21:46.688 --> 21:48.675
How many times
do I have to say the same thing?

21:48.676 --> 21:49.679
It's fine.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.739
It's not fine, it's disgusting!

21:50.740 --> 21:52.695
Don't go on at Dad.
Have you brushed your teeth properly?

21:52.696 --> 21:55.684
Nobody listens.
We need to be in the car.

22:00.700 --> 22:04.675
The road between Blackstone Edge
and Mytholmroyd remains closed

22:04.676 --> 22:09.667
as crime scene investigators continue
to analyse the isolated rural area

22:09.668 --> 22:13.691
where the incident took place
just after five o'clock yesterday evening.

22:13.692 --> 22:16.711
We know that we're looking for
a white transit van.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.695
Early indications from the scene

22:18.696 --> 22:21.707
suggest that a second vehicle
was involved in the incident.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.667
From debris left in the road,

22:23.668 --> 22:26.715
we're confident that we will be able
to identify the make and model

22:26.716 --> 22:28.703
and colour of that second vehicle.

22:28.704 --> 22:30.691
They now have the task of trying
to... Helen?

22:30.692 --> 22:32.723
.establish exactly what
happened... Awful.

22:32.724 --> 22:33.744
Are you all right?

22:35.744 --> 22:36.748
Where is she?

22:38.736 --> 22:40.716
She's somewhere.

22:44.704 --> 22:47.680
I've got my name on the roster
today. At the mission.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.675
I think I'd like to go.
And help out.

22:51.676 --> 22:52.747
Are you sure?

22:52.748 --> 22:56.703
Perhaps you should.
Keep yourself busy.

22:56.704 --> 22:58.760
Someone should be here, in case.

23:01.724 --> 23:03.759
She could just walk through
the door.

23:03.760 --> 23:07.720
Right, well, I'll ring in.

23:25.724 --> 23:27.676
Have you heard the news, Kevin?

23:28.728 --> 23:30.719
What... news?

23:30.720 --> 23:31.759
On the telly, this police woman.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.715
Oh, er, yeah.
Yeah, terrible.

23:34.716 --> 23:38.699
She was only 23
and it was just up here.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.759
Just up above Ripponden
on Scammonden Road.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.667
Yeah. Yeah.

23:43.668 --> 23:45.691
We wondered about having a whip-round
for the family.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.671
Do you think that's appropriate
to ask people for money or not?

23:48.672 --> 23:50.727
Nevison's not in this morning,
otherwise I'd ask him.

23:50.728 --> 23:53.667
Isn't he? Why?

23:53.668 --> 23:55.695
I think, er, Helen.

23:55.696 --> 23:56.739
Why? Is she...?

23:56.740 --> 23:59.720
No, no, nothing new, just...

24:00.756 --> 24:02.668
OK.

24:03.672 --> 24:04.703
So what do you think?

24:04.704 --> 24:05.708
Hm?

24:06.716 --> 24:07.724
Oh, sure.

24:18.732 --> 24:20.675
Hi, it's me.

24:20.676 --> 24:21.720
I don't want...

24:22.748 --> 24:24.667
I can't destroy it.

24:24.668 --> 24:26.699
I want to give it back. To Nevison.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.747
Well, you can't. How?

24:29.748 --> 24:31.740
I know I can't. I know that.

24:32.748 --> 24:35.676
But... I can't destroy it.
It's money.

24:37.740 --> 24:39.720
What about...?

24:41.716 --> 24:42.752
'What?'

24:45.684 --> 24:47.748
If we split it up.
Into smaller amounts.

24:48.764 --> 24:50.735
'Just a few hundred each.

24:50.736 --> 24:53.719
'And put some in your bank account,
and some in mine.'

24:53.720 --> 24:57.732
And... I don't know... just...

24:59.736 --> 25:00.764
..use it.

25:02.728 --> 25:04.712
To buy things with.

25:05.748 --> 25:07.711
'Small things.

25:07.712 --> 25:09.691
'Over a period of time.'

25:09.692 --> 25:10.712
You mean keep it?

25:13.684 --> 25:15.679
We'd just have to be careful

25:15.680 --> 25:18.520
that it didn't look like we suddenly
had a lot of money to throw around.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.695
No, don't hurt him!

25:25.696 --> 25:26.700
Come on, son.

25:28.732 --> 25:30.727
Don't hurt him!
Calm down, lad.

25:30.728 --> 25:33.703
You're making it a thousand times
harder for yourself than it need be.

25:33.704 --> 25:37.695
Hey, you're witnesses!
You've seen this!

25:37.696 --> 25:39.715
You're seeing what they're doing to
me!

25:39.716 --> 25:41.755
Hey, it's nutty Khalid.
Y'all right, nutty Khalid?

25:41.756 --> 25:44.699
If I'm never ever seen again,
you'll know!

25:44.700 --> 25:46.759
You'll know that I've been abducted!

25:46.760 --> 25:49.699
I am being abducted,
that's what this is!

25:49.700 --> 25:50.751
Stand up, Khalid. Get up.

25:50.752 --> 25:52.731
Yeah, really?
By the government!

25:52.732 --> 25:53.747
Course you are!

25:53.748 --> 25:55.743
Yeah, government's got
nowt better to do!

25:55.744 --> 25:58.739
No, because I know things! That's
why they've been spying on me.

25:58.740 --> 26:01.763
That's why they've been watching me
all day, every day!

26:01.764 --> 26:04.687
For months!
And you think I don't know!

26:04.688 --> 26:06.747
Well, I bloody do!
Is that why you wrap yerself up

26:06.748 --> 26:09.671
in tinfoil, you nutty bugger, eh?
Does he?

26:09.672 --> 26:11.671
Yeah, man, with a pan on his head...

26:11.672 --> 26:14.703
to stop the radio waves
penetratulating his brainium.

26:14.704 --> 26:16.727
Oi!

26:16.728 --> 26:18.731
# And another one
And another one

26:18.732 --> 26:20.727
# And another bites the dust

26:20.728 --> 26:22.747
# And another one down
And another one down

26:22.748 --> 26:25.676
# And another one bites the dust

26:27.748 --> 26:29.712
♪ And another one bites... ♪

26:32.704 --> 26:34.679
Get out of your vehicle.
Why?

26:34.680 --> 26:35.720
Get out of your vehicle.

26:39.680 --> 26:40.691
What did you say?
Nothing.

26:40.692 --> 26:41.683
No, I heard you. You said something.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.667
I'd like you to repeat it.
I-I didn't mean anything.

26:43.668 --> 26:44.747
I was just singing.
What were you singing?

26:44.748 --> 26:46.711
Nothing.
So you think it's funny?

26:46.712 --> 26:48.691
Cos I got the distinct impression
you thought it was funny.

26:48.692 --> 26:49.695
I don't know what you mean.

26:49.696 --> 26:50.727
So you think I'm stupid?
No.

26:50.728 --> 26:52.699
Do I look stupid?
No.

26:52.700 --> 26:53.723
Right, turn round.
Why?

26:53.724 --> 26:54.759
Turn around.
I haven't done anything.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.723
Yes, you have. You've used abusive
words and behaviour

26:57.724 --> 26:59.703
likely to cause a harassment,
alarm or distress,

26:59.704 --> 27:02.691
contrary to section 5 of the Public Order Act
which is why you're under arrest.

27:02.692 --> 27:03.743
I was just singing! You're not
obliged to say anything

27:03.744 --> 27:05.763
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when questioned

27:05.764 --> 27:08.711
something you later rely on court.
No, no, no!

27:08.712 --> 27:11.731
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

27:11.732 --> 27:12.755
Oh, no, no, you can't do that!

27:12.756 --> 27:16.687
No CCTV cameras in here, sunbeam.
It's your word against mine.

27:16.688 --> 27:18.691
I'm sorry. I've said I'm sorry.
Don't you ever...

27:18.692 --> 27:21.687
ever make fun of someone's death,

27:21.688 --> 27:24.763
you ignorant, rancid,
infinitesimal speck of dirt.

27:24.764 --> 27:26.672
I'm sorry.

27:30.668 --> 27:31.684
Get out.

27:33.732 --> 27:35.711
Why? What you gonna do now?

27:35.712 --> 27:36.759
I just de-arrested you.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.751
I'll make a note of the fact
that you apologised profusely.

27:39.752 --> 27:41.700
In tears.

27:46.696 --> 27:48.675
Mind how you go.

27:48.676 --> 27:49.687
What she say?

27:49.688 --> 27:50.687
Nothing.

27:50.688 --> 27:51.731
Eh? What she do to ya?

27:51.732 --> 27:52.740
Nothing!

28:17.744 --> 28:19.668
Done and dusted.

28:20.672 --> 28:21.735
Did you stay and watch him crush 'em?

28:21.736 --> 28:23.672
Yeah.
Both of 'em?

28:24.684 --> 28:25.688
Yes.

28:26.756 --> 28:28.732
Have you rung Nev?

28:30.720 --> 28:32.704
I'm not saying I won't. I just....

28:34.700 --> 28:36.672
I want to think it through.

28:38.712 --> 28:43.667
You do realise, either way,
we can't just let her go...

28:43.668 --> 28:44.716
don't you?

28:51.724 --> 28:53.703
There's no point screaming.

28:53.704 --> 28:55.752
There's never anyone here during
t'week.

29:05.728 --> 29:07.675
When can I go home?

29:07.676 --> 29:08.716
Soon.

29:09.744 --> 29:11.747
Maybe.

29:11.748 --> 29:15.764
S... Soon. I don't know.

29:20.756 --> 29:22.679
Help me!

29:22.680 --> 29:23.720
I can't.

29:25.700 --> 29:26.900
You're not like the other one.

29:27.764 --> 29:28.764
No. No...

29:30.676 --> 29:32.692
No, I'm not like that other one.

29:33.696 --> 29:34.724
Prove it.

29:35.756 --> 29:36.760
Help me.

29:38.712 --> 29:40.692
I'll say you helped me.

29:41.708 --> 29:44.691
I'll say you stopped him hurting me.

29:44.692 --> 29:46.092
You shouldn't have made that noise.

29:46.752 --> 29:47.756
Last night.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.748
None of it would've happened
if you didn't...

29:54.740 --> 29:56.759
What happened?

29:56.760 --> 29:58.719
The bang?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.680
What?

30:02.708 --> 30:05.688
Y-You shouldn't've...

30:06.692 --> 30:07.724
What?

30:16.740 --> 30:19.671
I'll have five minutes while we're
quiet if that's OK.

30:19.672 --> 30:20.753
Yeah, course you can, love.

30:44.684 --> 30:45.703
How are you feeling?

30:45.704 --> 30:46.728
Not so bad.

30:49.692 --> 30:53.679
I'm sorry, I just felt a bit...

30:53.680 --> 30:56.696
Hey. You don't need to apologise to
me.

30:58.684 --> 31:00.688
It's not the cancer...

31:01.724 --> 31:04.680
It's more... just...

31:05.752 --> 31:07.711
..not being able to cope...

31:07.712 --> 31:10.756
in the moment... sometimes.

31:14.696 --> 31:16.735
Have you heard any more
about your treatment?

31:16.736 --> 31:18.747
Pills. To start with.

31:18.748 --> 31:22.668
A whole cocktail of them,
three times a day. And then...

31:24.720 --> 31:25.756
..one step at a time.

31:27.732 --> 31:28.736
You'll be rattling.

31:30.740 --> 31:32.692
You make me smile.

31:34.688 --> 31:38.667
You helped me find a way forward
when I didn't think there was one.

31:38.668 --> 31:40.739
If there's the smallest,
tiniest thing I can do...

31:40.740 --> 31:41.744
There was something.

31:43.752 --> 31:45.747
Your sister, Catherine...

31:45.748 --> 31:47.700
is she...?

31:49.688 --> 31:50.723
What?

31:50.724 --> 31:53.668
A discreet sort of person.

31:54.688 --> 31:57.688
Yeah, she's... I'd have said so.

32:00.744 --> 32:03.747
There's something
I'd like to be able to ask

32:03.748 --> 32:06.732
a police officer about.

32:07.736 --> 32:09.671
OK.

32:09.672 --> 32:13.676
Do you think she might have
a few minutes if I...?

32:14.756 --> 32:16.679
Could I come to your house?

32:16.680 --> 32:18.683
Sure.

32:18.684 --> 32:19.751
This evening.

32:19.752 --> 32:21.688
Yeah.
She wouldn't mind?

32:23.676 --> 32:28.715
Oh... Just to warn you though,
she's a bit upset at the minute.

32:28.716 --> 32:31.735
Cos of that girl who got killed
last night up Scammonden Road.

32:31.736 --> 32:33.723
Catherine's her sergeant,

32:33.724 --> 32:36.667
and she's feeling it's all her
fault,

32:36.668 --> 32:38.719
which it isn't... She won't want
to be bothered with me.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.723
No.

32:39.724 --> 32:43.720
Honestly, Helen,
Catherine'd do anything for anybody.

32:44.748 --> 32:47.707
I would not be a popular person
in our house

32:47.708 --> 32:50.700
if I'd told somebody
she was too busy to listen to 'em.

34:24.679 --> 34:25.724
Stop it. Stop it.

34:53.676 --> 34:54.732
No, you can piss off.

35:21.740 --> 35:23.672
'Hello?'
Nev!

35:24.748 --> 35:25.764
How are we today?

35:28.728 --> 35:30.715
I want my daughter.

35:30.716 --> 35:33.724
I'm doing my best with these people,
Nev, believe you me.

35:35.684 --> 35:37.687
They're asking for another fifty
grand.

35:37.688 --> 35:38.720
I want proof...

35:39.736 --> 35:41.700
..that she's alive.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.735
You'd better not have been
talking to the 5-0, Nev.

35:46.736 --> 35:48.683
The what?

35:48.684 --> 35:51.707
The rozzers.
I haven't.

35:51.708 --> 35:55.731
OK. Well...

35:55.732 --> 35:57.675
as luck would have it,

35:57.676 --> 36:00.676
we do have a little photo of Annie
somebody's took.

36:01.676 --> 36:03.731
I'm just sending it over just now.

36:03.732 --> 36:06.716
I'll be in touch
as regards details tomorrow.

36:08.676 --> 36:11.711
And on the plus side,
this could be the last drop.

36:11.712 --> 36:12.755
W-What d'you mean?

36:12.756 --> 36:15.675
I think they might have had
enough of her.

36:15.676 --> 36:17.837
I think they might be thinking
it's time to let her go.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.671
Nevison. 'They want another fifty
grand tomorrow,

36:52.672 --> 36:54.720
'and then he says...'

36:55.720 --> 36:58.743
..they might start thinking
about letting go of her.

36:58.744 --> 37:00.672
Um...

37:01.672 --> 37:02.723
..will you...
will you make the delivery again

37:02.724 --> 37:05.739
if... if that's the way they want
it? I...

37:05.740 --> 37:07.735
Kevin?

37:07.736 --> 37:10.700
Why me? Well, I don't know!
I'm just asking.

37:11.712 --> 37:14.695
I-I think he meant it -

37:14.696 --> 37:15.760
about letting her go.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.764
Catherine... Ollie's here.

37:33.672 --> 37:35.668
Come in. How are you?

37:36.748 --> 37:38.728
That's a stupid question.

37:39.740 --> 37:41.679
Would you like some tea?

37:41.680 --> 37:42.712
No. I'm, er...

37:43.748 --> 37:44.751
No, thanks.

37:44.752 --> 37:46.716
Want to sit down?

37:51.752 --> 37:54.715
Can I get you something else?
Coffee?

37:54.716 --> 37:55.747
Water?

37:55.748 --> 37:56.756
Orange juice?

38:01.684 --> 38:02.688
I'll, er...

38:08.752 --> 38:11.743
Every room's full of flowers.

38:11.744 --> 38:14.683
Nowhere to put 'em,
we've got so many.

38:14.684 --> 38:16.723
Shafiq's filled the Land Rover twice
over and taken 'em

38:16.724 --> 38:18.676
to the residential home and...

38:19.724 --> 38:22.720
..they just keep coming.
She'd have given that thumbs up.

38:24.692 --> 38:26.704
Residential home.
Yeah.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.724
I, er...

38:29.740 --> 38:33.720
I didn't want to say this...
only it's been bugging me.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.688
She thought the world of you.

38:39.744 --> 38:41.688
You know that, don't you?

38:42.732 --> 38:44.731
Well, I thought a lot about her.

38:44.732 --> 38:48.715
Then Wednesday night,
night before yesterday,

38:48.716 --> 38:51.696
she were crying her eyes out
because of what you said to her.

38:52.704 --> 38:54.688
"I'm not your mother."

39:03.696 --> 39:05.727
I wasn't her mother.
Yeah, well, well done.

39:05.728 --> 39:08.700
You know, it's probably cos of what
you said she got killed...

39:09.724 --> 39:13.752
..trying to prove how tough she was
to some evil bastard.

39:19.740 --> 39:22.692
I'm sorry if you think I made a
mistake. "If I think"?

39:24.676 --> 39:26.672
It's difficult sometimes and...

39:29.696 --> 39:30.817
..being soft with someone...

39:32.684 --> 39:34.699
..when they've not quite
handled something

39:34.700 --> 39:36.667
isn't always what they need

39:36.668 --> 39:38.668
to bring 'em up to scratch.

39:39.728 --> 39:41.735
I couldn't have predicted
what was gonna happen

39:41.736 --> 39:44.667
any more than anybody else could've
done,

39:44.668 --> 39:47.748
and, you know, we don't know
what did happen, so don't...

39:48.760 --> 39:52.675
But if you think for one second that
I haven't thought about that myself,

39:52.676 --> 39:54.727
Ollie, you're wrong, because I have.

39:54.728 --> 39:57.747
I was thinking about it
at four o'clock and five o'clock

39:57.748 --> 39:59.728
and six o'clock this morning.

40:03.732 --> 40:04.736
Right.

40:40.696 --> 40:41.747
Did you think about what I said?

40:41.748 --> 40:43.759
About Ryan?
No, not about Ryan.

40:43.760 --> 40:47.699
About writing about all the drugs
that go on round here,

40:47.700 --> 40:49.755
about how much damage it's doing.
Oh, yeah, well...

40:49.756 --> 40:52.683
We had to help out this morning
with this lad that'd been sectioned.

40:52.684 --> 40:54.699
Social Services were there
to persuade him

40:54.700 --> 40:57.679
that he might like to go into a secure
unit for three months, but guess what?

40:57.680 --> 40:58.751
He weren't too keen,
so we had to wade in.

40:58.752 --> 41:01.683
He's been beating his mother up.
He pulled a knife out on her yesterday.

41:01.684 --> 41:02.755
He thinks the government
are sending her messages

41:02.756 --> 41:05.671
to her to poison him.
It's nuts, yeah, except it isn't.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.727
It's cannabis-induced psychosis.
That's what skunk does.

41:07.728 --> 41:10.727
Next time someone tells you
cannabis is harmless...

41:10.728 --> 41:12.739
I will. I will.

41:12.740 --> 41:15.707
I will... I will look into it.
And I arrested Marcus Gascoigne

41:15.708 --> 41:17.699
Wednesday morning for possession.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.699
He's a councillor.
Class A drugs.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.740
Write about it.

41:25.728 --> 41:27.672
Did you want to talk about Ryan?

41:29.752 --> 41:31.687
I wanted to talk about us.

41:31.688 --> 41:34.715
Well, there is no us, you divorced
me. I didn't divorce you.

41:34.716 --> 41:36.728
We got divorced.

41:41.708 --> 41:42.716
I'm sorry.

41:43.748 --> 41:45.764
Realise this isn't a great day for
you.

41:49.704 --> 41:52.688
What about us?
Eh?

41:54.672 --> 41:55.688
Oh, I don't know.

41:56.752 --> 41:58.668
Are you feeling bad?

41:59.688 --> 42:02.672
Yes.
About what you've done to Ros?

42:03.684 --> 42:05.680
But you still want to see me.

42:07.756 --> 42:10.748
I never stopped wanting to see you.

42:14.764 --> 42:16.668
How...

42:18.748 --> 42:20.680
How could you...

42:23.736 --> 42:27.680
How could... I do... something? What?

42:28.748 --> 42:32.747
I know what your answer will be.
Oh, well, you're way ahead of me.

42:32.748 --> 42:35.748
How could you let Ryan come between
us?

42:37.712 --> 42:41.708
Then you say, "How could I let
Ryan come between us?" So...

42:42.752 --> 42:44.692
There's no point going over it.

42:45.724 --> 42:46.732
It's old.

42:50.732 --> 42:51.736
What if...

42:53.716 --> 42:56.760
..what if I said I would play
football with him...

42:58.688 --> 42:59.692
..and...

43:02.732 --> 43:04.740
..make an effort with him.

43:07.728 --> 43:08.764
Really?

43:11.732 --> 43:15.667
You can't even say his name without
looking like you've had your face slapped.

43:15.668 --> 43:17.692
Maybe if I got to know him
it might be different.

43:20.676 --> 43:21.683
What about Ros?

43:21.684 --> 43:23.755
Oh, I don't think she'd mind
him visiting occasion...

43:23.756 --> 43:27.668
No, no, I meant
what about Ros as regards...

43:35.692 --> 43:36.696
Oh, shit!

43:46.712 --> 43:48.711
Sorry I'm late. I had a...

43:48.712 --> 43:51.711
I went, er... I met Richard for a
drink in the pub.

43:51.712 --> 43:54.695
It's OK. She hasn't turned up.
Richard, me grandad?

43:54.696 --> 43:55.707
Yeah. Yeah.

43:55.708 --> 43:56.711
Hasn't turned up?

43:56.712 --> 43:58.671
Did you ask him?
I said seven.

43:58.672 --> 44:01.683
She said fine, she were gonna drive
over, but, yeah, she's not turned up.

44:01.684 --> 44:04.683
Well, what was it to do with?
I've no idea.

44:04.684 --> 44:05.751
And she's not rung to say?

44:05.752 --> 44:07.667
No.
Did you ask him?

44:07.668 --> 44:09.735
Yes, I did, and he's...
he's thinking about it.

44:09.736 --> 44:12.703
What is there to think about?
Well, he's a busy bloke.

44:12.704 --> 44:13.715
Well, what was it about?

44:13.716 --> 44:15.727
I've no idea.
I thought he'd lost his job.

44:15.728 --> 44:17.723
Not yet.
But whatever it was, she were...

44:17.724 --> 44:19.711
you know, upset about it.

44:19.712 --> 44:20.755
I bet you haven't asked him!

44:20.756 --> 44:22.759
Well, did she not say?
I have asked him.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.699
I hate you!
I have asked him.

44:25.700 --> 44:28.716
You don't want me to play with him.
You know, that's just...

44:29.756 --> 44:31.731
She said that...

44:31.732 --> 44:35.671
She asked if you were discreet.
I don't know.

44:35.672 --> 44:37.667
Why didn't you ask?

44:37.668 --> 44:39.695
Cos she'd have told me
if she wanted me to know.

44:39.696 --> 44:41.679
Look, ring her.
What?

44:41.680 --> 44:42.723
Ring her.

44:42.724 --> 44:45.727
I can't ring her at home.
Why not? You're friends.

44:45.728 --> 44:46.751
It's...

44:46.752 --> 44:49.743
She's Helen Gallagher.
It's Nevison Gallagher's wife.

44:49.744 --> 44:51.675
It's fine at the Mission,

44:51.676 --> 44:53.687
we all muck in but... She's supposed
to be here and she isn't.

44:53.688 --> 44:55.739
She was distressed about something
and wanted to speak to a police officer.

44:55.740 --> 44:58.712
I wanna know that she's all right.
Ring her.

45:08.744 --> 45:10.699
Hello, Clare.
Hi, Helen.

45:10.700 --> 45:12.715
We were just wondering where you
were.

45:12.716 --> 45:16.691
Oh, sorry, sorry, I should've rung.

45:16.692 --> 45:21.683
Er, I've decided, um... it's fine.

45:21.684 --> 45:23.739
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have troubled
you.

45:23.740 --> 45:25.679
It's fine. You haven't.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.719
Is she all right?
Are you all right?

45:28.720 --> 45:31.687
'I'm fine. I'm fine. Really.
I'm sorry.'

45:31.688 --> 45:32.759
Can I speak to her?

45:32.760 --> 45:35.747
Catherine says can she speak to you?

45:35.748 --> 45:38.724
If... Well, if she wants to.

45:39.732 --> 45:41.747
'She's just here.'

45:41.748 --> 45:45.723
She says she's sorry, she just
changed her mind, that's all.

45:45.724 --> 45:46.760
She's got cancer.

45:48.748 --> 45:52.671
Helen, it's Catherine. I'm sorry to
hear you've not been well.

45:52.672 --> 45:55.715
Oh, that's...
You wanted some advice.

45:55.716 --> 45:58.723
Er, yes, I did, but I...

45:58.724 --> 46:00.668
But...?

46:01.704 --> 46:03.719
Is someone stopping you
from speaking to me?

46:03.720 --> 46:04.743
No.

46:04.744 --> 46:06.711
No, nothing like that.

46:06.712 --> 46:11.671
Has something bad happened?
I just... It's...

46:11.672 --> 46:12.732
It's fine, honestly.

46:13.744 --> 46:16.715
Are you in danger right now?
Are you in danger?

46:16.716 --> 46:21.679
'No, no, no. Honestly. I'm with my
husband. We're fine, it's fine.

46:21.680 --> 46:22.755
'I think I...'

46:22.756 --> 46:24.720
I overreacted.

46:25.724 --> 46:29.728
I'm sorry if I've troubled you, I'm
sorry if I've inconvenienced you.

46:32.716 --> 46:35.715
Well, I'm here.
You know where we are.

46:35.716 --> 46:38.715
Me and Clare. You can call our house
any time, day or night.

46:38.716 --> 46:40.716
I'm very sorry about your colleague.

46:42.732 --> 46:44.739
Oh... Thank you.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.676
Bye-bye, then.
'Bye-bye.'

46:49.668 --> 46:51.760
Is she all right, d'you think?
I don't know.

46:52.760 --> 46:55.708
She said, "I'm with my husband,"
like...

46:56.760 --> 46:58.695
That's why she couldn't speak to me.

46:58.696 --> 47:00.671
You don't think...
Nevison Gallagher, he...

47:00.672 --> 47:02.668
Oh, it takes all sorts.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.728
She always talks about him
really affectionately.

47:06.732 --> 47:09.715
OK.
Especially since she's been ill.

47:09.716 --> 47:11.699
Oh!
You're just jealous

47:11.700 --> 47:13.731
cos I might like him
better than I like you.

47:13.732 --> 47:15.751
Yeah, well, you might like to think
that.

47:15.752 --> 47:17.759
I wish I lived there with them.
Ryan.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.751
Don't speak
to your granny like that,

47:19.752 --> 47:21.731
she's had a very difficult day.

47:21.732 --> 47:22.760
I don't care.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.708
Are you all right?

47:28.728 --> 47:29.732
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:30.740 --> 47:34.691
I've got "punchbag" tattooed across
my forehead, but other than that.

47:34.692 --> 47:36.688
I think we're making a mistake.

47:38.676 --> 47:39.687
No.

47:39.688 --> 47:41.929
I should've just gone
and not told you where I was going.

47:43.672 --> 47:44.683
I'm glad you told me,

47:44.684 --> 47:46.731
and I understand why you wanted
to talk to her,

47:46.732 --> 47:51.667
but I'm convinced
this is the right way forward.

47:51.668 --> 47:52.700
Helen...

47:54.712 --> 47:59.747
..I think, after tomorrow,
they are going to let her go.

47:59.748 --> 48:02.707
And the police, you know,
they can be very good,

48:02.708 --> 48:07.671
but sometimes they just
get it very badly wrong.

48:07.672 --> 48:09.699
I've done everything they've said.

48:09.700 --> 48:10.860
I'm not going to blow it now.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.720
Why don't you want
the police around?

48:16.688 --> 48:19.764
That's... that's... that's just...
This is our daughter.

48:34.764 --> 48:38.724
On the plus side, of all...

48:39.728 --> 48:40.748
Kirsten.

48:43.700 --> 48:45.764
At least it's taken your mind
off Tommy Lee Royce.

52:15.744 --> 52:18.719
Right, he's rung.

52:18.720 --> 52:22.703
He does want you and this time
he wants it left in the toilets.

52:22.704 --> 52:24.671
Birch Services.

52:24.672 --> 52:26.763
M62, westbound services,
the men's toilets.

52:26.764 --> 52:30.735
The last cubicle
on the right-hand side as you go in.

52:30.736 --> 52:33.691
Stuff it behind the toilet.
All right?

52:33.692 --> 52:34.739
Then leave, quickly.

52:34.740 --> 52:36.740
Don't turn around and look back.
All right?

52:37.752 --> 52:39.672
I'm grateful, Kevin.

52:40.716 --> 52:43.679
It's fine.
It can't be safe. Can it?

52:43.680 --> 52:46.723
Leaving it in a toilet for any length
of time. They must be there.

52:46.724 --> 52:49.687
They must be there watching,
otherwise any bugger could find it.

52:49.688 --> 52:51.755
I-I don't know.
Well, we'll play it by the book...

52:51.756 --> 52:53.699
this time.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.715
Keep your eyes peeled.
Come straight back.

52:55.716 --> 52:59.760
Ring me the minute you drop it.
OK.

53:38.736 --> 53:41.728
Look who's here.
Fifty thousand.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.763
I should get going.
Not so soon.

53:44.764 --> 53:47.712
You're meant to be on the M62.

53:48.716 --> 53:51.764
D'you want some tea?
No... thank you.

53:55.708 --> 53:57.684
He, er, Nevison, said...

53:58.716 --> 54:01.744
..he got the idea from you
that you might let her go...

54:03.688 --> 54:04.720
..now, after...

54:06.708 --> 54:09.723
I'd just like to say...
I think perhaps you should.

54:09.724 --> 54:12.720
I don't think we need to do this any
more, I mean, not from my...

54:14.684 --> 54:16.675
Right, that's yours.

54:16.676 --> 54:17.692
Five grand.

54:18.708 --> 54:20.672
Take it.

54:26.676 --> 54:27.680
So, er...

54:28.728 --> 54:30.684
..so as regards...

54:31.692 --> 54:33.744
..Ann.
I'll be in touch.

54:35.692 --> 54:37.724
Is she all right?

54:39.668 --> 54:40.724
She's absolutely fine.

54:43.712 --> 54:45.740
Is she?
Yes.

54:50.696 --> 54:51.719
OK.

54:51.720 --> 54:52.740
We just...

54:54.764 --> 54:56.763
What?
Well, I told you.

54:56.764 --> 54:59.763
Police, policewoman,
knocking on the door,

54:59.764 --> 55:01.735
at the house where we were keeping
her.

55:01.736 --> 55:04.695
Well, it was nothing, but...

55:04.696 --> 55:07.712
if she knew we were holding her
there, she'd have had the door down.

55:08.740 --> 55:12.688
But we still don't know
what she was doing there, so...

55:14.668 --> 55:16.731
What did she look like,
the policewoman?

55:16.732 --> 55:18.675
I don't know. I didn't see her.

55:18.676 --> 55:19.743
It was Tommy.

55:19.744 --> 55:21.680
Why?

55:22.716 --> 55:23.736
No reason.

55:25.688 --> 55:28.755
Anyway, we've moved her - Ann -

55:28.756 --> 55:30.668
but...

55:31.732 --> 55:33.735
Yeah. I think it might be time

55:33.736 --> 55:35.740
to bring the thing to a close...

55:36.756 --> 55:38.744
..one way or another.

55:40.728 --> 55:41.732
I'd better, er...

55:42.728 --> 55:45.724
Take your time.
You don't want him thinking things.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.671
Stupid wanker.

55:58.672 --> 56:00.112
Do you want to say that
a bit louder?

56:00.748 --> 56:02.751
It's all your fault!

56:02.752 --> 56:05.739
You genius,
who never gets his hands mucky.

56:05.740 --> 56:08.735
Do I know what you're talking
about? Don't you?

56:08.736 --> 56:10.763
Policewoman on Scammonden Road.

56:10.764 --> 56:13.747
How... how is that...?
Has he not told you?

56:13.748 --> 56:15.747
We had to move her - Ann -

56:15.748 --> 56:18.695
only, little policewoman decides
to pull us over, doesn't she?

56:18.696 --> 56:21.136
Cos there's a light out on the van.
So that mad bastard, he...

56:22.680 --> 56:23.752
Your fault.

56:33.728 --> 56:36.763
You know that day I came home and
said, "Tommy Lee Royce is out of prison"?

56:36.764 --> 56:40.687
Do you remember?
Yeah.

56:40.688 --> 56:42.715
And you said, "I know."
And I said, "Why didn't you tell me?"

56:42.716 --> 56:44.683
And you said,
"I didn't want to upset you."

56:44.684 --> 56:45.699
Yeah.

56:45.700 --> 56:47.684
Yeah, well, how did you know?

56:48.732 --> 56:49.752
He was here.

56:51.676 --> 56:54.751
He came in here once or twice
after he got released.

56:54.752 --> 56:56.743
They often come in here,

56:56.744 --> 57:01.675
ex-cons, till they've
sorted themselves out.

57:01.676 --> 57:05.751
Are you cross? Because if you are,
you needn't be.

57:05.752 --> 57:07.712
You know what you get like.

57:08.708 --> 57:10.740
I didn't say anything
because I care about you.

57:12.740 --> 57:14.756
'Are you speaking to me?'
Yeah.

57:17.708 --> 57:20.715
'So... did you find anything out?'

57:20.716 --> 57:22.683
There's no-one there.

57:22.684 --> 57:25.739
I broke in, and, yeah, I found
something - I don't know what exactly.

57:25.740 --> 57:29.715
Knocked on a few doors either side,
but nobody seems to know anything.

57:29.716 --> 57:32.691
I think he's had someone in there,
I think he's hurt someone in there.

57:32.692 --> 57:33.715
'How?

57:33.716 --> 57:34.736
'Why?'

57:35.748 --> 57:37.732
Cos I found things in the cellar.

57:38.736 --> 57:43.703
'Well... can't you investigate it
properly if...?'

57:43.704 --> 57:44.727
Yeah! How?

57:44.728 --> 57:48.687
'No crime's been reported,
and I've just broken into a house.'

57:48.688 --> 57:50.929
The fact that I'm a police officer
doesn't make it legal.

57:54.752 --> 57:56.727
I might go knocking
on his mother's door.

57:56.728 --> 57:58.716
'She won't know owt, but...

57:59.724 --> 58:01.679
'..might find out who owns this
house.'

58:01.680 --> 58:04.751
I still don't know what it is
you think you're going to do to him.

58:04.752 --> 58:07.707
Nothing, Clare.
I'm not going to do anything to him.

58:07.708 --> 58:10.764
I just want to make sure that he's
not going to do anything to anybody else.
