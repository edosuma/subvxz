Alexandra Nelson?</i>

00:55.623 --> 00:56.958
Yeah, who's this?

00:56.991 --> 00:59.526
<i>I'm a paramedic with
Cumberland County Medic One.</i>

00:59.559 --> 01:00.695
<i>I'm here with Margaret Nelson.</i>

01:00.728 --> 01:02.195
Okay.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.831
<i>I'm afraid she's had
a major stroke</i>

01:03.865 --> 01:06.266
<i>and you're the first name
in her phone's address book.</i>

01:06.299 --> 01:08.836
I haven't talked to her
in, like, six years, so...

01:08.870 --> 01:11.538
<i>She's likely to pass away
in the next few hours,</i>

01:11.571 --> 01:13.540
<i>so, if you wanna see her,
you'll want to...</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:15.643
I can't do this.

02:01.923 --> 02:02.990
Hey.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.351
Hi. Yeah, I think

02:31.384 --> 02:33.587
you might have
my mom over there.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.324
I don't know. She...
She might already be, uh...

02:39.326 --> 02:40.393
dead.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.697
Margaret Nelson.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.067
Yeah, I can hold.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.903
I'm so annoyed.
You're always up my ass.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.872
Can we just get through today
without a blow-up?

02:50.905 --> 02:52.740
If you can stop barking orders
at me...

02:52.774 --> 02:54.876
- I didn't want to get strand...
- "Oh, we're gonna get stranded

02:54.909 --> 02:56.210
"because we're
running out of gas.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.512
"We're gonna die on the road
'cause we're running out of gas."

02:58.545 --> 03:00.480
You don't have to be
so nasty all the time.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.016
You don't have to be
such a stupid bitch.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.757
Yeah.

03:13.828 --> 03:14.829
Oh.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.301
Okay, yeah.

03:22.637 --> 03:23.638
Thank you.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.781
You okay?

03:36.117 --> 03:37.285
None of your business.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.508
What are you doing here?

06:17.078 --> 06:18.813
This is my home.
What are you doing here?

06:19.947 --> 06:22.683
- Jenny's room is next door.
- Come on.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.151
Wait, you're a cop now?

06:24.185 --> 06:27.554
County Deputy, actually, and, uh,
yeah, I'm kinda doing my job right now.

06:27.587 --> 06:30.124
I guess that makes sense.
Power-hungry bully

06:30.157 --> 06:33.094
who enjoys making people feel
small, hitting, punching...

06:33.127 --> 06:34.996
You know what? I just got here.

06:35.029 --> 06:36.931
- Do we need to do this right now?
- I'm sorry.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.800
Wait, no, I'm not sorry, Travis,
'cause I'm not scared of you anymore.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.103
What do you want me to do? Okay?
The neighbors called in a prowler.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.638
Does it look like I'm fucking prowling?
This is my house.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.307
Okay, well,
they don't know that.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.843
And you haven't been here in, I don't
know, how many years and you just show up?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.244
Oh, that's cute.
You've been counting.

06:50.277 --> 06:53.781
Just... Maybe you won't have any
neighbors calling in a cat burglar

06:53.814 --> 06:55.249
if you came home
every once in a while.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.650
Why would I come home, Travis?

06:56.684 --> 07:01.055
So I could bear witness to the "rags
to riches" rise of Travis Kinney

07:01.088 --> 07:03.190
from a knife-hit novice
to police chief?

07:03.224 --> 07:05.159
- Why are you so angry?
- Why do you care?

07:07.128 --> 07:09.797
- You look like hell.
- Gee, thanks.

07:09.830 --> 07:13.000
Maybe you should just get some
sleep, you know, before you...

07:13.034 --> 07:15.568
- I was sleeping and then you...
- More sleep.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.838
Your mom's probably
already cremated by now anyway.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.041
Wait. Cremated? What?

07:20.074 --> 07:21.809
What are you talking about?
Who made that call?

07:21.842 --> 07:22.977
I don't know. Her doctor?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.713
She doesn't have a say in
what happens to her own body?

07:25.746 --> 07:28.282
That's on the doctor who was
in the room when she died.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.750
So, take it up with him.

07:29.784 --> 07:32.787
She actually had a family plot she
inherited, like, a hundred years ago.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.089
She never stopped talking
about it.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.957
But I guess that's something
I would know

07:36.991 --> 07:38.626
as the person she gave birth to.

07:38.659 --> 07:42.029
Uh-huh, well, she probably
changed her mind.

07:42.063 --> 07:44.065
I mean, you did kind of
disown yourself from everybody.

07:44.098 --> 07:46.834
Despite how you might
see things, Travis,

07:46.867 --> 07:48.069
nobody owns me.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.971
And although
she did take your side

07:51.839 --> 07:54.008
when you knocked
the fuck out of me,

07:54.041 --> 07:56.610
I highly doubt that she spent
her final days on the porch,

07:56.644 --> 07:59.313
chugging back beers and
discussing her wishes with you.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.816
What do you want from me? Okay?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.417
Doctor had to have
been there to hear.

08:03.451 --> 08:05.252
Are you going to get out of my way,
or do I have to solve a fucking riddle?

08:06.220 --> 08:07.254
You know...

08:08.789 --> 08:10.958
the funeral home
closes soon anyway,

08:10.991 --> 08:12.059
so it's probably
already done by now.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.593
Pick up the ashes tomorrow.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.863
Travis, shut up
and get out of my way.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.898
You're still like a cat, huh?
Scratch you too much, you bite?

08:17.932 --> 08:20.267
You're still like an asshole.
Ain't nothing but shit comes out.

08:20.301 --> 08:22.803
You know, we had
some good times, all right?

08:22.837 --> 08:25.272
You're right.
We most certainly did.

08:25.306 --> 08:28.008
And you could be so sweet.

08:28.042 --> 08:30.077
But those times you took me
to Victoria will not make up for

08:30.111 --> 08:32.379
the time that you
shoved me into the wall,

08:32.413 --> 08:36.217
the time that you took advantage of my
little sister who was a fucking child!

08:36.250 --> 08:37.718
Okay!

08:46.427 --> 08:47.661
Yeah.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.298
- Sorry for your loss.
- Fuck you!

09:28.969 --> 09:30.171
Hey.

09:30.204 --> 09:32.806
Uh, my mom was
cremated here today.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.875
I know you guys are closed,
but can you let me in?

09:34.909 --> 09:37.945
- Nah, it's closed.
- Yeah, okay, but I've been driving for, like, 14 hours.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.280
Sorry. It's closed.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.615
I just need two minutes.

09:40.649 --> 09:43.751
We don't work here. You're not
supposed to be back here anyway.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.086
- Dude, please!
- Miss Alexandra?

09:46.120 --> 09:48.756
- Who are you?
- Curtis Lee. You used to babysit me.

09:48.789 --> 09:52.326
- Dude, don't tell her...
- Curty, can you let me in?

09:52.359 --> 09:55.262
Uh, I don't wanna be rude,
but, like, can you go?

09:55.296 --> 09:57.031
Okay, seriously,
what's going on here?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.499
- What's in your truck?
- Trash.

09:58.532 --> 10:00.734
Yeah, it looked like
a dead body.

10:00.768 --> 10:04.438
I don't know how else to explain it to you.
It's trash, okay?

10:04.471 --> 10:06.073
- I don't believe you.
- Calm down.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.209
Why are you so angry?

10:08.242 --> 10:10.878
- Miss Alexandra...
- You need to stop calling me that, Curty.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.247
- Please.
- What are you guys doing?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.115
Shit!

10:20.354 --> 10:22.223
Calm down.

10:22.256 --> 10:24.425
Calm down.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.766
- Did you fucking kill her?
- No, man, I just choked her out.

10:34.969 --> 10:36.870
Get her in the truck.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.473
That fucking UFC shit
works, man.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.384
You piece of shit!

11:27.121 --> 11:29.356
Fuck you!

11:38.633 --> 11:40.200
You're gonna pull a muscle.

11:45.607 --> 11:48.575
You still cry
at lightning storms, Curty?

11:48.610 --> 11:52.279
Yeah, go ahead.
She'll behave. Won't you?

11:52.313 --> 11:54.148
How can I misbehave
when you have that

11:54.181 --> 11:56.016
totem of insecurity
pointed at me?

11:57.584 --> 11:59.119
I'm secure.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.889
I'm sure every man
who shot his wife or girlfriend

12:01.922 --> 12:04.024
said that right before
pulling the trigger.

12:04.058 --> 12:06.628
Well, I can't apologize for
every time that's happened

12:06.661 --> 12:07.729
in world history.

12:07.762 --> 12:10.597
And I'm not about to get into
a gun control debate

12:10.632 --> 12:13.133
with another terrified libtard.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.170
Listen, I know that
today is not normal.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.639
What's not normal about it?

12:17.672 --> 12:21.208
Men asserting dominance
over my body...

12:21.241 --> 12:25.112
insulting me verbally
and physically.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.281
But I haven't been catcalled
today, so you might be right.

12:27.314 --> 12:31.018
I am trying to
be civil here.

12:31.051 --> 12:31.985
Can we be civil?

12:32.019 --> 12:33.454
You had that pointed at me
a minute ago.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.889
You need to figure out
how to calm down.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.425
Maybe you should stop giving
me reasons not to be calm.

12:38.459 --> 12:39.560
Why are you so angry?

12:39.593 --> 12:42.363
Gee, you wonder why?

12:42.396 --> 12:46.033
So what is it that you think
that you've stumbled onto here?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.368
I grew up in this area.

12:47.401 --> 12:51.105
We're still the number one meth
county in the country, right?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.373
Maybe you've been out of town,

12:52.406 --> 12:55.476
but you are in
way over your head, girl.

12:55.509 --> 12:56.510
Yeah? Uh-huh, listen.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.146
There were scarier meth guys
in my high school.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.981
And frankly,
you remind me of the teacher

13:01.014 --> 13:03.384
who liked to put his hand
down my shirt.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.185
And much like him,
I'm sure you don't want

13:05.219 --> 13:08.355
any extra attention
for your misdeeds.

13:08.389 --> 13:09.556
So I'm gonna get
the fuck out of here...

13:09.590 --> 13:11.358
You're cute,
but you clearly don't...

13:11.392 --> 13:12.960
All right.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.397
I can't let you leave yet.

13:16.430 --> 13:18.365
Unless you want to
give me a ride.

13:18.399 --> 13:21.201
- You're not going anywhere.
- Or what? You're gonna kill me?

13:21.235 --> 13:23.303
You're not
a fucking killer, dude.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.305
Stupid girl.

13:25.339 --> 13:28.142
I fucking told you to...

13:28.175 --> 13:32.045
You fucking bitch!

13:32.079 --> 13:34.948
Bitch! Fuck!

13:35.382 --> 13:37.317
Oh, God damn it!

14:49.556 --> 14:50.591
What are you doing?

14:52.526 --> 14:54.461
- Who are you?
- I asked you first.

14:56.831 --> 14:59.566
We process organs
and tissue here.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.704
How about you put the gun down?

15:02.737 --> 15:05.439
How about you keep
your hands up?

15:05.472 --> 15:08.208
There's no need for all this.

15:08.242 --> 15:09.811
That's what the last guy said...

15:09.844 --> 15:12.479
right before
he choked me unconscious.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.047
Wait, don't touch that!

15:14.081 --> 15:16.016
You'll contaminate it.

15:16.684 --> 15:18.285
What the fuck is this?

15:19.086 --> 15:20.655
A cadaver.

15:20.688 --> 15:23.625
You said you process
organs and tissues?

15:23.658 --> 15:26.794
Yes, a form of organ donation.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.664
Did you touch her?

15:29.697 --> 15:32.533
Did you put
you fucking hands on her?

15:32.566 --> 15:35.402
That's necessary
when processing a cadaver.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.372
- My mother.
- Excuse me?

15:38.405 --> 15:41.275
This isn't a cadaver.
This is my fucking mom!

15:43.343 --> 15:48.081
Technically, your mother ceased
to exist when she passed away.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.183
This is really just
a bundle of meat, so...

15:50.217 --> 15:53.688
You're really gonna mansplain
my dead mother to me right now?

15:53.721 --> 15:55.255
I suppose not.

15:57.759 --> 16:00.427
I thought
she was supposed to be cremated.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.434
Let me go.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.737
Get off me!

16:27.588 --> 16:29.356
- Back off.
- Shit!

16:29.389 --> 16:31.491
- Help!
- Put that down.

16:31.525 --> 16:33.360
Or else what?

16:33.393 --> 16:35.395
They don't let you two
have guns, do they?

16:37.164 --> 16:39.533
- Did you know my mom was in there?
- What?

16:39.566 --> 16:43.270
The woman who bought you an Xbox
game every year for your birthday.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.672
She liked you, Curty.

16:44.706 --> 16:47.207
Maybe rethink
your employment situation.

17:49.737 --> 17:50.738
Hi.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.775
I have a gun.

17:53.808 --> 17:56.276
Well, I don't.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.613
- Do you have a cell phone?
- Sorry, not on me.

17:58.646 --> 18:01.515
- Who doesn't have a cell phone?
- Uh, you?

18:03.316 --> 18:04.886
Are you okay?

18:04.919 --> 18:06.353
I mean, the blood and stuff.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.858
I'm not the one bleeding.

18:10.892 --> 18:12.627
Oh. Okay.

18:12.660 --> 18:15.395
- I'm just trying to survive here.
- Me, too.

18:15.429 --> 18:18.633
So I don't want to get involved in
whatever it is you got going on here.

18:18.666 --> 18:19.767
Which way is it to town?

18:22.937 --> 18:25.439
- Don't follow me.
- Well, I kinda have to.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.274
You just said
you don't wanna get involved.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.410
Home's that way,
and this baby's gonna get cold.

18:30.444 --> 18:33.648
So, if any of those boys from the
farm back there are coming after you,

18:33.681 --> 18:35.348
we'll just have to
deal with that as it comes.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.451
- Wait, you know those guys?
- I do.

18:37.885 --> 18:38.986
How?

18:39.020 --> 18:40.154
I do their housekeeping.

18:40.188 --> 18:42.456
- Are you gonna tell them where I am?
- Probably not.

18:43.557 --> 18:46.027
- Why?
- I just clean their buildings.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.895
I don't go beyond
my job description.

18:47.929 --> 18:51.264
I didn't chase down shoplifters
when I worked at Walmart either.

18:51.899 --> 18:53.433
And with these guys,

18:53.467 --> 18:56.536
I'd rather not get
more involved than I already am.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.706
Have you considered
other employment?

18:58.740 --> 19:01.341
The job market doesn't
really allow me to be choosy.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.610
I got priorities here.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.345
Right.

19:07.081 --> 19:09.349
You don't have to walk so fast.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.785
You know those guys
you work for?

19:10.818 --> 19:12.486
One of them lost a lot of blood,

19:12.519 --> 19:14.588
and they probably want to
talk to me about that.

19:14.622 --> 19:16.556
So, yes,
I do have to walk this fast.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.291
What? You want to find a phone
and call the cops?

19:18.325 --> 19:19.894
Yeah, they have
my mom back there.

19:19.927 --> 19:21.896
What? They kidnapped
your mother?

19:21.929 --> 19:23.998
They didn't kidnap her exactly.

19:24.031 --> 19:26.399
They have...
They have her body and...

19:26.433 --> 19:28.035
Oh, they got her for that.

19:29.103 --> 19:30.303
Shit.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.040
Yeah.

19:33.074 --> 19:37.945
But listen... Calling the cops,
that won't work how you think.

19:37.979 --> 19:40.081
I don't know a lot about
how these guys work,

19:40.114 --> 19:41.649
but what I do know,

19:41.682 --> 19:44.484
they got all kinds of people
on the payroll.

19:44.518 --> 19:47.420
If the person answering 911
isn't in on it,

19:47.454 --> 19:49.056
the cop they send out will be.

19:49.757 --> 19:51.626
And there you go.

19:51.659 --> 19:54.461
So did you get there before
or after they, um, you know...

19:54.896 --> 19:56.731
Before.

19:56.764 --> 19:59.566
Sort of cut up the guy
that was gonna do the cutting.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.602
So, I guess I'll be cleaning up
your mess today.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.739
Probably. Sorry.

20:04.772 --> 20:06.641
Girl, I used to clean motels.

20:06.674 --> 20:09.010
I've smelled smells that
don't even have names.

20:11.112 --> 20:12.880
So you know these guys,

20:12.914 --> 20:15.549
if you were me,
what would you do?

20:16.717 --> 20:18.052
I'd get into town,

20:18.085 --> 20:20.922
find the nearest phone,
walk right past that phone,

20:20.955 --> 20:22.790
get in my car and drive
as far the fuck away

20:22.824 --> 20:24.125
from here
as fast as I could

20:24.158 --> 20:25.525
and never come back.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.494
Yeah.

20:30.631 --> 20:33.433
This is literally a choice
between staying alive

20:33.466 --> 20:34.869
or getting dead.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.604
These guys
don't fuck around.

20:36.637 --> 20:38.505
They didn't seem so tough.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.008
Yeah, the guys you saw
were the local yokels.

20:41.042 --> 20:42.576
It's usually just
a couple of dickheads

20:42.610 --> 20:44.145
doing the day-to-day stuff.

20:44.178 --> 20:46.881
They set this whole deal
up like a chessboard

20:46.914 --> 20:49.549
with different pieces
in a pecking order.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.918
Now, I don't play chess,

20:50.952 --> 20:52.620
but I know
the pawn's the weakest.

20:54.021 --> 20:56.958
Saw the bishop once
before though and

20:56.991 --> 20:59.861
he came across as a guy
you don't wanna come at.

20:59.894 --> 21:02.096
You won't get anywhere
if you try these guys again.

21:02.964 --> 21:03.965
Just go on out.

21:04.732 --> 21:05.800
You got any kids?

21:06.133 --> 21:07.168
No.

21:07.201 --> 21:09.103
Boyfriend, husband? Wife?

21:09.136 --> 21:10.705
No. No.

21:10.738 --> 21:12.974
You got your whole life
laid out at your feet.

21:13.007 --> 21:15.176
Just go someplace
other than here.

21:15.209 --> 21:17.444
Keep your head down
and try to be happy.

21:17.945 --> 21:18.946
Happy?

21:19.680 --> 21:20.715
What's that like?

21:20.748 --> 21:21.782
I know, right?

21:22.850 --> 21:23.851
For me?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.585
It's him right here.

21:26.621 --> 21:28.555
He's my thing.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.423
My thing that
keeps me from the brink.

21:32.093 --> 21:34.662
One day,
his father showed up,

21:34.695 --> 21:36.163
said he was gonna
take him away from me,

21:36.197 --> 21:37.698
and I'd never see him again.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.134
He recorded phone calls.

21:40.167 --> 21:41.602
Where I lost my cool.

21:42.670 --> 21:45.072
Said things
I shouldn't have said.

21:45.106 --> 21:48.042
And he used that
to convince CPS

21:48.075 --> 21:49.844
that I was
an unfit mother.

21:52.079 --> 21:54.481
So I packed up everything I
could in the car and left.

21:55.783 --> 21:57.118
Drove halfway
across the country...

21:58.585 --> 21:59.854
'cause he's my thing.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.023
The only thing.

22:03.891 --> 22:05.626
Without him,
what's happy?

22:06.127 --> 22:07.962
Beats me.

22:07.995 --> 22:10.031
I've never
really been happy.

22:10.798 --> 22:12.199
And last night,
I was convinced

22:12.233 --> 22:14.835
nothing ever would
truly make me happy.

22:16.237 --> 22:17.504
I was ready to quit.

22:19.073 --> 22:20.808
And I know those feelings
don't just go away

22:20.841 --> 22:21.842
if you don't end up...

22:22.977 --> 22:24.544
pulling it off.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.947
I'm glad you didn't
pull it off.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.514
Thanks.

22:28.182 --> 22:29.216
Me and my mom
hadn't been

22:29.250 --> 22:31.185
on speaking terms
for a while,

22:32.519 --> 22:33.654
so I never
really considered

22:33.688 --> 22:34.722
what would happen

22:34.755 --> 22:36.223
if she wasn't
around until...

22:38.192 --> 22:39.193
she wasn't.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.065
I still don't know if I have
the words for the feeling,

22:44.098 --> 22:45.565
but I know if that
feeling wasn't there,

22:45.598 --> 22:47.868
then I'd be sitting there,
right back to where

22:47.902 --> 22:50.204
I was last night
before I got the call.

22:50.237 --> 22:52.073
Going really hard
at pulling it off.

22:53.007 --> 22:55.609
Okay, so this is
your thing?

22:55.643 --> 22:56.744
Yeah.

22:56.777 --> 22:58.646
Right now my mom
is my thing.

22:58.679 --> 23:00.513
Just like that cute
little dude is yours.

23:03.284 --> 23:04.517
Yeah.

23:09.724 --> 23:10.725
Hold on a second.

23:17.331 --> 23:18.565
Here.

23:18.598 --> 23:19.633
Blood is not your color.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.803
I'd offer you a ride,
but, you know.

23:23.704 --> 23:24.839
Yeah, I know.

23:24.872 --> 23:26.674
So just go down there,

23:26.707 --> 23:29.176
take a right
and you'll hit Hedwards Road

23:29.210 --> 23:30.711
and you follow that
down to the pits.

23:30.745 --> 23:31.879
I know the area.

23:31.912 --> 23:35.049
I smoked Escobar levels
of weed there in high school.

23:35.082 --> 23:37.151
Yeah, I feel like
I got to say it.

23:37.918 --> 23:40.587
Get in your car
and drive away.

23:40.621 --> 23:42.823
Forget about all of this
and just go.

24:25.833 --> 24:27.868
Oh, hey, hey.
Hey. Hey.

24:27.902 --> 24:29.603
Hey, it's me.
It's me. All right?

24:30.237 --> 24:31.238
Just take it easy.

24:32.039 --> 24:33.074
You want this?

24:34.375 --> 24:36.043
Here.

24:36.077 --> 24:37.011
Got your keys
in there, too,

24:37.044 --> 24:38.946
so you can thank me
for not letting tweakers

24:38.979 --> 24:40.081
take your phone
and your car.

24:40.114 --> 24:41.782
Yeah, can I get
those back?

24:41.816 --> 24:43.617
First, why do you have
a fucking gun?

24:43.651 --> 24:45.086
Self-defense?
Why do you have one?

24:45.119 --> 24:47.054
Because I'm supposed
to have one.

24:47.088 --> 24:48.155
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

24:48.189 --> 24:49.190
I'm calling the cops.

24:49.223 --> 24:51.392
- Look, I am the cops...
- Don't fucking touch me.

24:51.425 --> 24:53.294
You don't need to call
any more cops.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.862
I'm calling
all the cops.

24:54.895 --> 24:57.398
- I don't trust you.
- Look, I get it, okay?

24:57.431 --> 25:00.000
We haven't seen
each other in years.

25:00.034 --> 25:02.736
We didn't end on a
particularly awesome note.

25:02.770 --> 25:04.038
I get it. All right?
It's just...

25:07.108 --> 25:08.676
- Are you okay?
- Do I look okay?

25:08.709 --> 25:10.878
- Just calm down.
- Calm fucking down?

25:10.911 --> 25:12.213
Do not start with me
on that shit.

25:12.246 --> 25:13.914
Sorry. Sorry.

25:13.948 --> 25:16.150
Chopping up bodies out
past the mill and...

25:16.183 --> 25:17.852
- That's crazy. What?
- Some guy has my mom.

25:17.885 --> 25:19.353
And I got this
gun actually...

25:19.386 --> 25:20.888
I can't understand
when you're like this, okay?

25:20.921 --> 25:23.290
How much I care
about you understanding...

25:23.324 --> 25:25.059
should be pretty clear
based off the fact that

25:25.092 --> 25:26.393
I am calling
different cops.

25:26.427 --> 25:27.461
Can you just
give me the gun?

25:27.495 --> 25:29.396
Can you just call this in
to one of your buddies,

25:29.430 --> 25:31.298
who's, like,
a non-corrupt...

25:31.332 --> 25:32.833
whatever you call
a non-corrupt cop.

25:32.867 --> 25:34.135
- A good cop.
- A good cop.

25:34.168 --> 25:36.370
- I'm a good cop.
- I've never believed

25:36.403 --> 25:38.339
anything less
in my life.

25:38.372 --> 25:40.307
And even if I fucking did,

25:40.341 --> 25:41.442
you couldn't handle
all this shit

25:41.475 --> 25:42.576
on your own, Travis.

25:42.611 --> 25:46.247
So can you please just call
this in as a favor to me?

25:46.280 --> 25:47.882
For being
the world's shittiest

25:47.915 --> 25:49.083
boyfriend or whatever?

25:50.317 --> 25:51.752
Okay.

25:53.154 --> 25:54.155
Fine. Whatever.

25:55.356 --> 25:57.191
- Where again?
- Out on Echo Lake.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.393
It's past the mill
by the gorge.

25:59.426 --> 26:00.995
There's a big farm.
They are chopping up bodies,

26:01.028 --> 26:02.163
I don't know what for.

26:03.230 --> 26:04.331
Okay.

26:28.489 --> 26:29.723
Okay.

26:29.757 --> 26:30.958
It's all called in.

26:30.991 --> 26:32.193
They're on their way.

26:32.726 --> 26:34.428
Now can you please...

26:34.461 --> 26:35.529
just give me the gun?

26:35.563 --> 26:38.098
Why? Do I need to show you
my permit or something?

26:38.132 --> 26:39.333
- No, it's just that...
- What, Travis?

26:39.366 --> 26:40.868
We've learned
shooting together.

26:40.901 --> 26:42.503
I did also go
to basic training. I know...

26:42.536 --> 26:44.738
And you had to get kicked
out for doing drugs.

26:44.772 --> 26:46.173
What, do you think I'm gonna
cheat on you with a gun

26:46.207 --> 26:47.241
- or something?
- Come on.

26:47.274 --> 26:48.309
Come on, what?

26:48.342 --> 26:51.078
Half the black eyes
you gave me...

26:51.111 --> 26:53.013
were because you thought
I was fucking the neighbor,

26:53.047 --> 26:55.015
- the mailman...
- Ancient fucking history.

26:56.217 --> 26:57.051
Jesus.

26:57.084 --> 26:59.286
It's like yesterday
for me, you know.

27:00.487 --> 27:02.790
I have to relive
your bullshit...

27:02.823 --> 27:05.292
- every single day.
- I wasn't that bad.

27:05.326 --> 27:06.961
Every time I see
a girl in public

27:06.994 --> 27:08.429
who looked scared
of her boyfriend...

27:08.462 --> 27:09.964
You don't need
to do this.

27:09.997 --> 27:11.498
Every time I see
a TV show about rape...

27:11.532 --> 27:13.300
Okay, I get it.

27:13.334 --> 27:14.969
Every time I wake up
in the morning

27:15.002 --> 27:15.836
and my shoulder hurts

27:15.869 --> 27:18.038
from when you threw me
down the stairs.

27:18.072 --> 27:19.473
Okay, how many times...

27:19.506 --> 27:21.342
do I have to say
I'm sorry for all that?

27:21.375 --> 27:23.477
You could start with one.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.079
Okay. I'm sorry.

27:25.112 --> 27:27.181
I'm sorry.

27:27.214 --> 27:30.484
Okay, But...
just give me the gun.

27:30.517 --> 27:32.419
All right?
'Cause when they get here...

27:32.453 --> 27:34.922
and they see you holding it,
it's not gonna look good.

27:35.923 --> 27:38.826
Okay. You happy?

27:38.859 --> 27:40.995
All cops shoot white
people for no reason.

27:41.028 --> 27:43.430
Believe it or not,
I don't want them to kill you.

27:43.464 --> 27:45.099
Why would they?

27:45.132 --> 27:46.800
You told them
I'm not a threat, right?

27:49.069 --> 27:50.070
Right?

27:51.572 --> 27:52.840
You're in on it.

27:52.873 --> 27:54.108
You're fucking in on it.

27:54.141 --> 27:56.110
You don't just know them.
You're part of this.

27:56.143 --> 27:57.411
That's... that's crazy.
What? What?

27:57.444 --> 27:58.747
No, No, I'm not crazy.

27:58.779 --> 28:01.148
- You can't say I'm crazy anymore.
- You're wrong. You're wrong.

28:01.181 --> 28:03.217
- Back the fuck up.
- Whoa, whoa. Okay.

28:03.250 --> 28:04.952
Do you see a vest?

28:04.985 --> 28:08.155
No. That's because
I came here trusting you.

28:08.188 --> 28:09.223
We don't need
to do this.

28:09.256 --> 28:11.258
What do we need
to do, Travis?

28:11.292 --> 28:13.060
Get me all
disarmed and safe

28:13.093 --> 28:15.329
for your body
snatcher buddies.

28:15.362 --> 28:17.298
That's who
you called, right?

28:17.331 --> 28:20.567
- You haven't changed a bit...
- Just grow the fuck up.

28:20.601 --> 28:23.537
And by that, you mean,
accept my fate is dictated

28:23.570 --> 28:25.572
by some dude who thinks
he has authority over me?

28:25.607 --> 28:29.310
What then?
What do I need to do...

28:29.343 --> 28:31.011
to get you
to be reasonable?

28:31.045 --> 28:33.213
Nothing. Just give me
my fucking keys.

28:33.247 --> 28:35.416
Your mom is dead
from natural causes, okay?

28:35.449 --> 28:36.984
I had nothing
to do with it.

28:38.485 --> 28:40.054
But you got here
real fast...

28:40.954 --> 28:42.323
and I... Look,

28:42.356 --> 28:44.491
I didn't even think
you would come.

28:44.525 --> 28:47.061
And, you know,
it's gonna sound crass.

28:47.094 --> 28:48.095
Okay?

28:50.030 --> 28:51.633
But a dead body's
a dead body

28:51.666 --> 28:54.201
and there are people that
would pay really good money

28:54.234 --> 28:55.369
for the organs
and everything.

28:55.402 --> 28:57.037
All the stuff. Okay.

28:57.071 --> 28:58.372
We have
a good thing going.

28:58.405 --> 28:59.440
You're fucking kidding me.

28:59.473 --> 29:02.142
But only
if we keep it quiet...

29:02.176 --> 29:04.411
Okay? If there's
any exposure...

29:04.445 --> 29:06.146
they'll leave. Okay?

29:06.180 --> 29:08.115
They'll leave and they'll
take all of their money,

29:08.148 --> 29:09.516
and everyone here loses...

29:11.485 --> 29:13.520
including you.

29:13.554 --> 29:15.989
What is it that you
think I have to lose?

29:16.023 --> 29:17.891
How about your life?

29:17.925 --> 29:20.127
They will take
your life...

29:20.160 --> 29:21.562
if you fuck
with their thing.

29:21.595 --> 29:24.298
They can't have my mom.
It's non-negotiable.

29:24.331 --> 29:25.432
They already have her.

29:25.466 --> 29:27.568
I'm trying to help you.

29:27.601 --> 29:30.471
- You always said that.
- What?

29:30.504 --> 29:32.106
You always said you
were trying to help me.

29:32.139 --> 29:33.073
You always said what?

29:33.107 --> 29:35.409
Even though you know
what you heard me say.

29:35.442 --> 29:37.378
You always say "what,"
to throw me off.

29:37.411 --> 29:39.546
You always said "what,"
like that word was a weapon.

29:39.580 --> 29:42.349
You were never trying to help
me, were you?

29:42.383 --> 29:43.618
Just calm down.

29:43.651 --> 29:46.019
Stop fucking saying that!

29:46.053 --> 29:48.989
They told me to try and get
you to listen to reason.

29:51.425 --> 29:54.128
And if you
wouldn't listen to reason,

29:54.161 --> 29:56.430
I'm not making
you do anything.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.998
- This is your last chance.
- I'll shoot you.

29:58.031 --> 29:59.166
I swear to God,
I'll fucking shoot you.

29:59.199 --> 30:00.267
No, you won't.

30:01.603 --> 30:04.037
- You can't.
- No, Travis, please.

30:04.071 --> 30:05.673
Please don't do this to me.
Don't make me do this.

30:05.707 --> 30:08.509
Just put it down.
Just... trust me.

30:08.542 --> 30:11.044
No, I don't trust you.
You're a fucking snake.

30:12.546 --> 30:15.315
I always told you your temper
is gonna get you killed.

30:44.411 --> 30:45.546
You're a cunt.

36:19.479 --> 36:22.083
I am sorry to have
to break this news,

36:22.116 --> 36:23.918
but after tonight,

36:23.951 --> 36:26.353
we'll no longer
need your services.

36:26.386 --> 36:28.522
I figured as much.

36:28.555 --> 36:29.690
We're not worried
about security with you.

36:29.724 --> 36:32.093
You've been quiet about all
this since you got here.

36:32.126 --> 36:34.962
And, well, you know that
we know your background.

36:34.996 --> 36:35.963
Yeah.

36:35.997 --> 36:36.998
We'll furnish you
with a more-than-fair

36:37.031 --> 36:39.801
severance for all your
hard work and discretion.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.502
Plenty to keep
you afloat for a bit

36:42.536 --> 36:44.806
while you figure out
your next gig.

36:44.839 --> 36:47.008
Look, you all have
treated me well,

36:47.041 --> 36:49.442
probably pay me more
than you should.

36:49.476 --> 36:51.378
But I knew this
wasn't a forever deal.

36:51.411 --> 36:53.948
Didn't have any
aspirations of heading up

36:53.981 --> 36:55.482
the janitorial
department and all.

36:55.515 --> 36:57.618
Of course.

36:57.652 --> 36:59.519
I don't want to be
insulting here,

36:59.553 --> 37:01.989
but, uh, I have
to remind you that

37:02.023 --> 37:04.357
ears will stay open
around here, so just...

37:04.391 --> 37:06.093
I know, I get it.

37:06.127 --> 37:09.529
How long do you think you'll
be until you're finished?

37:09.563 --> 37:13.466
A lot of mess here. I don't know.
An hour or two, maybe.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.502
Let's make it one, please.

37:47.534 --> 37:49.502
There's only about
70 grand here.

38:25.206 --> 38:27.975
Go, go.
Go away. Go.

38:31.846 --> 38:34.849
Hey, I had a couple of
questions about the restroom.

38:34.882 --> 38:37.184
- Okay?
- I haven't had to do that room yet,

38:37.218 --> 38:39.987
you know, like, do it.

38:56.837 --> 39:00.207
Well, we'll just have to
consider burning this place down.

39:00.241 --> 39:02.610
Do whatever.
I'm just telling you,

39:02.643 --> 39:04.245
with all this grout,
the nooks and crannies

39:04.278 --> 39:06.814
probably can't get fully
cleaned of DNA or whatever.

39:06.847 --> 39:07.848
Right?

39:55.930 --> 39:57.898
I just want
my mom's body.

39:57.932 --> 40:00.201
Can I do that?
Can I just get her and go?

40:02.069 --> 40:03.104
Do not make me shoot you.

40:03.137 --> 40:05.072
I don't want to shoot you.
I don't want to do this.

40:07.808 --> 40:09.276
Whoa!

40:09.310 --> 40:11.312
Whoa!

41:30.391 --> 41:31.859
Okay.

41:47.942 --> 41:49.343
I'm really not
in the fucking mood.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.178
Drop your weapons now.

41:52.947 --> 41:55.249
Dude, this is not the time to
think of a fucking workaround.

41:55.282 --> 41:57.218
All your buddies are out
of commission in there.

41:57.251 --> 41:59.220
Take your weapons, toss them.

41:59.253 --> 42:02.189
I said, I'm not in the mood.

42:04.191 --> 42:05.793
Okay.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.172
Dude!

42:19.073 --> 42:20.808
No, no, no, no!

43:09.223 --> 43:10.357
Hey.

43:12.526 --> 43:14.795
It's safe now.

43:14.828 --> 43:15.996
You should
probably get out of here.

44:49.256 --> 44:51.492
<i>This is Jenny,
you know what to do.</i>

44:54.862 --> 44:56.130
Jenny, listen.

44:57.231 --> 44:58.899
I'm sorry.

44:58.932 --> 45:00.434
Okay? I'm really sorry.

45:01.935 --> 45:04.204
I'm sorry I left you.

45:04.238 --> 45:05.906
I went away
and I never came back

45:05.939 --> 45:07.941
and I just left you here like...

45:10.311 --> 45:14.581
I really thought it would
have been worse to stay around.

45:14.616 --> 45:19.520
Well, where I went
was way fucking worse.

45:21.155 --> 45:23.424
You know
how I get about everything...

45:23.457 --> 45:27.027
obsessive about working out,

45:27.061 --> 45:29.430
dating the wrong people,

45:29.463 --> 45:32.232
drugs, alcohol,
self-mutilation...

45:32.266 --> 45:35.069
Thought I gave
each one of those things

45:35.102 --> 45:38.105
good, hard dedication
for years.

45:40.675 --> 45:43.110
Honestly, I don't know
how I'm still alive.

45:45.346 --> 45:47.147
I'm really sorry
for telling you this

45:47.181 --> 45:50.184
in a stupid voice recording.

45:50.217 --> 45:53.655
I really, really wish I could
see you just one more time,

45:53.688 --> 45:56.490
just once, but I can't...

45:57.324 --> 46:01.328
Because Mom's dead, Jenny.

46:01.362 --> 46:06.467
She's dead and I had to put her in
a place so nobody would find her.

46:06.500 --> 46:09.503
I don't even know how to explain it.
It's just awful.

46:12.072 --> 46:14.074
So don't try
to find her because

46:14.108 --> 46:16.343
this is just really
fucked up, okay?

46:16.377 --> 46:18.011
It's so fucked up.

46:20.013 --> 46:22.049
But I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go for good.

46:22.082 --> 46:24.619
I'm gonna leave
and I'm not gonna come back.

46:24.652 --> 46:27.221
I'm so sorry, Jenny.
I'm so sorry.

46:35.028 --> 46:37.464
We could have
marched up here in tap shoes.

46:40.334 --> 46:43.937
Oh, you shouldn't have left
the engine running on the truck

46:43.971 --> 46:46.473
with a GPS tracker
stuck in it.

46:50.177 --> 46:52.946
Good news for you
is that your mother's body

46:52.980 --> 46:56.517
is pretty much worthless to us
now, so she'll stay intact.

46:56.550 --> 46:58.519
Without cold storage too long,

46:58.552 --> 47:00.454
not a high-dollar cadaver
to begin with.

47:01.588 --> 47:03.524
Bad news...

47:03.557 --> 47:07.127
you and your little operation
ruined a very lucrative business

47:07.161 --> 47:08.996
that's been running
out of that property.

47:09.029 --> 47:11.131
Now I have to build back up
from scratch.

47:11.165 --> 47:14.201
But I know that murdering you
right now

47:14.234 --> 47:18.673
is the number one way to keep us
from finding out where your crew is.

47:20.374 --> 47:22.142
The other guys?

47:22.176 --> 47:25.245
Yeah, the other guys
with our petty cash.

47:25.279 --> 47:27.281
There are no other guys.

47:27.314 --> 47:29.149
Come on.

47:29.183 --> 47:33.153
What? You don't think a woman
is capable of doing all this?

47:33.187 --> 47:36.156
Does the thought
hurt your fragile little ego?

47:38.192 --> 47:42.262
Uncomfortable memories
from when I beat your ass?

47:42.296 --> 47:43.397
Cut it out.

47:47.067 --> 47:49.169
Anything you can do,

47:49.203 --> 47:50.672
I can do bleeding.

47:50.705 --> 47:52.139
You may not care
for your life,

47:52.172 --> 47:54.107
but what about
the people you love?

47:54.141 --> 47:55.677
What about, uh,

47:55.710 --> 47:57.277
your sister?

47:57.311 --> 47:59.012
I haven't seen her
in years.

47:59.046 --> 48:01.215
More bad news.

48:01.248 --> 48:03.718
We have people tracking
her down right now tonight.

48:03.751 --> 48:06.453
- That's not necessary.
- I think it is very necessary

48:06.487 --> 48:08.790
until we get you
straightened out.

48:08.823 --> 48:10.557
Just let me bury
my fucking mom, okay?

48:10.591 --> 48:14.228
What if a mountain lion
digs her up?

48:14.261 --> 48:17.231
Or some kid out working on
a wilderness merit badge,

48:17.264 --> 48:19.533
stumbles on the grave,
then what?

48:19.566 --> 48:21.468
They aren't gonna find you.

48:21.502 --> 48:23.437
You don't need to bring
my sister into this.

48:23.470 --> 48:26.206
You can either tell me
what I want to know now

48:26.240 --> 48:28.041
or you can tell me
what I want to know

48:28.075 --> 48:30.444
after I show you
some cell phone pictures

48:30.477 --> 48:32.145
of what your sister looks like

48:33.080 --> 48:34.281
without an ear.

48:34.314 --> 48:36.583
I'm here all alone.

48:36.618 --> 48:38.318
There is
no one else here. Jesus!

48:38.352 --> 48:39.687
Well, how do I verify that?

48:39.721 --> 48:42.189
How am I supposed to prove to
you that something doesn't exist?

48:43.625 --> 48:46.560
I am the best person
to negotiate with.

48:46.593 --> 48:48.362
Trust me.

48:48.395 --> 48:50.765
I guarantee you some
of my co-workers...

48:50.798 --> 48:53.233
will not be
nearly as diplomatic.

48:53.267 --> 48:56.270
You call
all this shit diplomatic?

48:56.303 --> 48:58.071
You're a piece of shit!

48:58.105 --> 49:00.808
These two... These two
are majorly pieces of shit.

49:00.842 --> 49:05.613
Frankly, everyone that I've met
today is a total piece of shit!

49:05.647 --> 49:08.650
You know, they call me
when they need help.

49:10.183 --> 49:13.353
I'm not here to hurt.
I am here to help.

49:15.122 --> 49:17.759
So help me help you,
help me understand

49:17.792 --> 49:19.593
why are you so angry?

49:20.728 --> 49:23.063
I'm angry?

49:25.365 --> 49:27.869
My life has been nothing

49:27.902 --> 49:33.240
but dudes flying off the handle at the slightest
threat to their perceived masculinity.

49:33.273 --> 49:37.712
Some guy standing here threatening
mutilation to me and my sister.

49:37.745 --> 49:41.315
And he wants to know
why I'm so fucking angry.

49:44.585 --> 49:46.086
I asked.

49:48.155 --> 49:50.858
I remember
when I was a little kid,

49:50.892 --> 49:52.492
my mom...

49:52.526 --> 49:54.662
she started setting me up
on these stupid play dates

49:54.696 --> 49:56.530
with the boy
across the street.

49:56.563 --> 49:57.832
He was an idiot.

49:57.865 --> 50:00.400
He'd, like, jump up and down
and wave his hands over my face

50:00.434 --> 50:01.568
trying to get my attention.

50:02.569 --> 50:05.405
And all I wanted to do
was play with my Legos.

50:06.608 --> 50:09.142
I remember the shadow

50:09.176 --> 50:10.577
from his hand on my face

50:11.746 --> 50:13.781
'cause it would block out
the sun.

50:16.718 --> 50:19.386
And my world
got a little darker.

50:19.419 --> 50:20.755
The older I got,

50:22.624 --> 50:25.727
the more boys showed up...

50:25.760 --> 50:29.162
Waving their hands trying to
get my attention, you know...

50:29.196 --> 50:31.565
Blocking out the sun.

50:31.598 --> 50:33.300
Then I got older,

50:33.333 --> 50:35.168
and the fingers on those hands

50:35.202 --> 50:38.372
started to curl,
clench and restrain and hold me down...

50:41.909 --> 50:45.412
And my world
got a lot darker.

50:45.445 --> 50:47.882
It got to the point where
there was no light at all

50:47.915 --> 50:50.217
because all I could fucking see
was fists

50:50.250 --> 50:51.653
blocking out the sun.

50:52.654 --> 50:53.755
And you...

50:54.722 --> 50:57.591
another man with your fists.

50:57.625 --> 51:00.327
You wanna know
why I'm so fucking angry?

51:18.746 --> 51:19.747
You got me.

51:22.315 --> 51:24.852
I'll assume I rudely
underestimated your prowess.

51:24.886 --> 51:28.221
You got me. Fierce kill.

51:28.255 --> 51:31.224
Could you do me a favor and toss me the
med kit out of the back of that truck?

51:32.026 --> 51:34.962
I'd show you the wound.

51:34.996 --> 51:36.798
But you just murdered
two of my guys,

51:36.831 --> 51:39.801
and I don't think you have a very
high opinion of me right now.

51:41.636 --> 51:43.771
I promise not to pull
a fast one.

51:44.706 --> 51:46.339
I'm just bleeding here.

52:06.426 --> 52:08.963
Drop that right fucking now.

52:08.996 --> 52:11.465
I'm gonna count to one
and then I'm going to shoot you.

52:15.302 --> 52:17.504
Whatever else you got, lose it.

52:17.537 --> 52:18.973
I will fire at you, dude.

52:20.474 --> 52:21.575
I don't doubt it.

52:24.812 --> 52:27.314
How many more people
get to shoot him tonight?

52:27.347 --> 52:29.617
I'm sure we can find
some eager volunteers.

52:33.054 --> 52:36.958
There was a day
when I was young and spry.

52:36.991 --> 52:38.358
And I wouldn't
have mentioned this.

52:38.391 --> 52:41.528
I would have tried to find an
opening to disarm and disable you.

52:42.797 --> 52:44.331
That day is

52:45.066 --> 52:46.466
not today.

52:47.769 --> 52:49.402
You're smarter than I thought.

52:50.570 --> 52:52.405
Also, don't care anymore.

52:54.541 --> 52:55.710
I'm a tired old man.

52:56.443 --> 52:58.445
Still a man...

52:58.478 --> 53:00.848
A man who tried to shoot me.

53:00.882 --> 53:04.752
- We're not all bad, you know.
- You know, men keep telling me that today,

53:04.786 --> 53:07.688
usually right after they've
threatened me with a firearm.

53:11.358 --> 53:12.492
You did get me, though.

53:12.526 --> 53:15.763
I just want to give my mom
the peace that she deserves.

53:15.797 --> 53:18.365
The peace that you guys
didn't want to let her have.

53:19.499 --> 53:21.803
- What about the theft?
- The money?

53:21.836 --> 53:25.006
That money doesn't even cover the
shit that you've put me through today.

53:25.039 --> 53:27.775
I don't have it
and I don't even care about it.

53:27.809 --> 53:29.342
I mean, okay.

53:29.376 --> 53:30.745
So you're gonna tell me
where my sister is or what?

53:30.778 --> 53:33.614
I have no idea where your sister is.
That's not how things work.

53:33.648 --> 53:34.749
Yeah, I don't believe you.

53:34.782 --> 53:37.952
You know how Al-Qaeda works?

53:37.985 --> 53:39.687
Terrorist groups,
splinter cells.

53:40.621 --> 53:42.924
It's a great system.

53:42.957 --> 53:45.392
You could stick hot needles
in my eyes for days at a time,

53:45.425 --> 53:49.563
you'll never get a location
'cause I don't know it.

53:49.596 --> 53:51.565
I report to rooks.
They report to the king.

53:51.598 --> 53:52.967
King calls the plays...

53:53.000 --> 53:56.436
I have no idea where
any rooks are right now

53:56.469 --> 53:57.805
or where the king is.

53:59.774 --> 54:01.008
Fuck.

54:02.576 --> 54:04.111
If it's any consolation.

54:04.145 --> 54:05.847
I'd tell you if I knew.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.849
A true fucking gentleman.

54:09.549 --> 54:12.119
I know I'm not really
in a position to make deals.

54:14.722 --> 54:17.892
But can you promise me
a bullet right here?

54:20.962 --> 54:22.395
Honor among...

54:22.930 --> 54:24.531
warriors, whatever.

54:25.633 --> 54:27.869
I'm a dead man, either way.

54:27.902 --> 54:30.605
I'm not the only one that
knows about the GPS tracker.

54:32.039 --> 54:34.709
Ah, blood loss doesn't do me.

54:34.742 --> 54:37.011
They'll make it
slow and painful.

54:37.044 --> 54:39.546
You know, as an example
to others.

54:40.147 --> 54:41.581
Boo-fucking-hoo.

54:41.616 --> 54:43.383
I am not looking

54:43.818 --> 54:44.986
for sympathy.

54:46.519 --> 54:47.554
Do we have a deal or what?

54:51.458 --> 54:53.426
Here I thought
you were an honorable girl.

54:53.460 --> 54:55.796
Woman. I'm a woman.

54:58.498 --> 54:59.700
Right.

55:09.977 --> 55:11.578
One bullet to the head.

55:11.612 --> 55:13.446
But I'm not your murder mommy.

55:13.480 --> 55:14.849
Do it yourself, dude.

56:21.816 --> 56:22.984
Hey, you need some help?

56:23.784 --> 56:24.852
No.

56:25.786 --> 56:28.789
- Car trouble?
- Nope. I'm good. Thank you.

56:28.823 --> 56:31.792
Hey, I've got some tools in my car.
I can take a look for you.

56:31.826 --> 56:33.260
No, dude. I'm good.

56:33.294 --> 56:35.528
Are you sure?
I know a thing or two.

56:35.562 --> 56:37.064
Dude, you need to back off.

56:37.098 --> 56:39.633
Wow. I was just trying
to talk to you.

56:41.836 --> 56:43.804
I don't want to date you.
I don't want to talk to you.

56:43.838 --> 56:46.307
I don't want to fuck you.
I have a boyfriend.

56:46.340 --> 56:48.642
I have a husband.
I have a girlfriend. I have a wife.

56:48.676 --> 56:49.844
I have an yeast infection.

56:49.877 --> 56:52.880
Whatever it is that I need
to say to get you to go away

56:52.913 --> 56:54.882
right now
is what's happening with me.

56:56.851 --> 56:58.085
I'm a nice guy, you know.

56:59.353 --> 57:00.654
Uh-huh.

57:08.062 --> 57:09.196
Bitch.

58:13.894 --> 58:16.030
He was a dream today.

58:16.063 --> 58:17.798
- He is a dream, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

58:17.832 --> 58:19.100
Best thing in my life.

58:19.133 --> 58:20.768
- He had three BMs.
- Good.

58:20.801 --> 58:22.903
Yeah, and I could have sworn
he was laughing.

58:22.937 --> 58:24.004
Okay.

58:25.806 --> 58:27.775
Hey, do you know
your schedule for next week yet?

58:29.243 --> 58:31.278
- I'll have to get back to you on that.
- No worries.

58:32.813 --> 58:34.248
- Thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

58:35.015 --> 58:36.050
All righty.

58:37.118 --> 58:38.385
- See ya.
- Bye.

59:41.882 --> 59:43.284
We're closed. Sorry.

59:43.317 --> 59:45.786
Um... I'm looking for my sister.

59:45.819 --> 59:47.922
She works here.
Her name is Jenny Nelson.

59:47.955 --> 59:49.390
- I don't know.
- It's serious.

59:50.491 --> 59:52.126
She works at one of these stands

59:52.159 --> 59:53.494
doing whatever it is
you guys do.

59:53.527 --> 59:56.230
Look, I don't know a Jenny.
Okay, I don't know her.

59:56.263 --> 59:58.766
And doing whatever it is we do?

59:58.799 --> 1:00:01.368
I get this shit all the time
from soccer moms and churchies

1:00:01.402 --> 1:00:02.736
and other hypocrites.

1:00:02.770 --> 1:00:03.904
This is a job, okay?

1:00:03.938 --> 1:00:06.473
You think me showing some
side boob is less honorable

1:00:06.507 --> 1:00:08.409
than restocking shelves
at the dollar store?

1:00:08.976 --> 1:00:10.744
Fuck off.

1:00:10.778 --> 1:00:12.012
Do I have to call the cops?

1:00:12.046 --> 1:00:14.748
I take getting called a whore
when I'm open, but we're closed.

1:00:17.284 --> 1:00:18.752
Oh, that's Sapphire.

1:00:19.987 --> 1:00:21.322
I didn't know her real name.

1:00:21.355 --> 1:00:24.225
Well, do you know
a phone number, address?

1:00:24.258 --> 1:00:25.759
Maybe where she might be?

1:00:25.793 --> 1:00:28.862
Her social media
is Sapphire Barista.

1:00:28.896 --> 1:00:30.431
Okay, cool. Thank you.

1:00:33.534 --> 1:00:34.735
Hey,

1:00:35.402 --> 1:00:36.403
do you want a coffee?

1:00:37.204 --> 1:00:38.772
You look really tired.

1:01:44.004 --> 1:01:45.005
Is Sapphire here?

1:01:50.544 --> 1:01:52.346
Sapphire, is she here or what?

1:01:53.213 --> 1:01:54.281
Why? Who are you?

1:01:54.315 --> 1:01:55.349
Her sister.

1:01:55.382 --> 1:01:57.184
Girl, you look fucked up.

1:02:02.356 --> 1:02:03.390
She's in the back with Matty.

1:02:03.424 --> 1:02:04.425
Cool.

1:02:55.442 --> 1:02:56.443
Jenny.

1:02:57.277 --> 1:02:58.646
Is your phone even on?

1:02:58.680 --> 1:02:59.714
Who are you?

1:02:59.748 --> 1:03:02.015
- Alex?
- We really gotta go. Come on.

1:03:02.049 --> 1:03:03.917
- What?
- Who is this?

1:03:03.951 --> 1:03:05.052
Why are you here?

1:03:05.085 --> 1:03:06.320
You can't just show up
out of nowhere.

1:03:06.353 --> 1:03:08.288
I'll explain in the car.
You really have to go.

1:03:08.322 --> 1:03:10.357
Who the fuck are you?

1:03:10.391 --> 1:03:12.960
I'm not talking to you, asshole.

1:03:12.993 --> 1:03:14.128
Why are you so angry?

1:03:14.161 --> 1:03:16.664
Because I've been dealing
with dickheads like you all day.

1:03:17.431 --> 1:03:18.465
Fuck?

1:03:18.499 --> 1:03:19.600
Jenny, come on. Let's go.

1:03:19.634 --> 1:03:21.568
Get the fuck out of here, bitch.

1:03:21.602 --> 1:03:22.637
You need to back the fuck up.

1:03:23.270 --> 1:03:24.304
Now.

1:03:24.338 --> 1:03:25.439
Easy.

1:03:27.441 --> 1:03:28.509
You know how to use that thing?

1:03:28.542 --> 1:03:30.645
Alex, what the fuck
are you doing?

1:03:30.678 --> 1:03:32.446
It's a matter of life
and death, Jenny.

1:03:32.479 --> 1:03:34.716
You can be mad,
but be mad in the car.

1:03:34.749 --> 1:03:37.384
You're not getting out of here
with any teeth in your head.

1:03:37.418 --> 1:03:39.353
You fucked up big time, girlie.

1:03:39.386 --> 1:03:41.255
Oh, put your dick away, dude.
No one cares.

1:03:43.157 --> 1:03:44.893
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

1:03:52.299 --> 1:03:53.701
Have fun with that.

1:03:53.735 --> 1:03:55.302
Got to keep the crackheads out.

1:03:56.537 --> 1:03:57.504
Do they have guns?

1:03:57.538 --> 1:03:59.339
What the fuck are you doing?
You are such a...

1:03:59.373 --> 1:04:00.340
Do they have guns or not?

1:04:00.374 --> 1:04:02.309
I don't know. They're not
a gang or anything.

1:04:02.342 --> 1:04:04.679
They're just some fucking guys.
And this is Matty's dad's place.

1:04:04.712 --> 1:04:05.747
He's gonna tear it down.

1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:07.014
So, no?

1:04:07.047 --> 1:04:08.348
I mean, I never see any here.

1:04:08.382 --> 1:04:09.583
Okay, okay, okay.

1:04:09.617 --> 1:04:12.186
Why are you here?
I haven't seen you in years.

1:04:12.219 --> 1:04:13.688
And you just show up
waving a gun around.

1:04:13.721 --> 1:04:16.089
Jenny, it's complicated.
It's complicated. Okay?

1:04:16.123 --> 1:04:17.157
It's Mom and she...

1:04:17.191 --> 1:04:18.192
Yo, bitch.

1:04:18.626 --> 1:04:19.627
Get out here.

1:04:20.762 --> 1:04:21.962
Mom?

1:04:23.397 --> 1:04:24.398
Hold on.

1:04:26.634 --> 1:04:28.068
Matty.

1:04:28.101 --> 1:04:29.470
This is my sister, okay?

1:04:29.503 --> 1:04:31.505
Clearly, she's had a rough day.

1:04:31.538 --> 1:04:33.006
Can we just get out of here?

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:34.141
Something's going on
with our mom.

1:04:34.174 --> 1:04:35.509
Fuck your mom.

1:04:35.542 --> 1:04:38.312
Fuck you and especially
fuck your sister.

1:04:38.345 --> 1:04:39.246
Excuse me?

1:04:39.279 --> 1:04:41.114
Get that girl out here
right fucking now.

1:04:41.148 --> 1:04:42.149
Or what?

1:04:53.494 --> 1:04:54.629
Come out
and get your beating.

1:04:56.096 --> 1:04:58.031
Fucking scared.

1:04:58.065 --> 1:05:00.067
Got something else
to put in my fucking face?

1:05:02.102 --> 1:05:03.103
You got ten seconds.

1:05:04.471 --> 1:05:06.373
- Ten...
- What are you doing?

1:05:06.406 --> 1:05:08.575
- Nine...
- No, no.

1:05:08.610 --> 1:05:11.211
Eight, seven...

1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:15.683
Six, five...

1:05:17.518 --> 1:05:20.187
four, three...

1:05:22.089 --> 1:05:25.660
two, one...

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:14.922
We need to call 911, now.

1:09:16.023 --> 1:09:17.024
No, we don't.

1:09:18.492 --> 1:09:19.493
Why?

1:09:26.033 --> 1:09:27.400
What happened, Alex?

1:09:27.434 --> 1:09:28.803
What the fuck is all this?

1:09:32.506 --> 1:09:33.507
What happened?

1:09:37.444 --> 1:09:38.445
Where's Mom?

1:09:43.416 --> 1:09:44.551
What is that?

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:47.054
Jenny, get in the car. Come on.

1:09:50.658 --> 1:09:51.659
What the fuck?

1:09:53.828 --> 1:09:54.829
Jenny, come on.

1:09:56.496 --> 1:09:57.832
What did you do?

1:09:57.865 --> 1:09:59.066
What did you do to her?

1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:00.400
I didn't
do anything, Jenny.

1:10:00.433 --> 1:10:01.636
She died of a stroke last night.

1:10:01.669 --> 1:10:03.503
We cannot be here.
We have to go.

1:10:03.537 --> 1:10:05.606
She wasn't even sick.
I talked to her last week.

1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:06.908
Stop fighting.

1:10:06.941 --> 1:10:07.875
Why did you hate her?

1:10:07.909 --> 1:10:09.143
We can have this conversation
in the car.

1:10:09.177 --> 1:10:12.445
Imagine your own daughter won't
even talk to you for years.

1:10:12.479 --> 1:10:13.648
Jenny, please.

1:10:13.681 --> 1:10:14.682
You killed her.

1:10:19.854 --> 1:10:21.722
I was a bad daughter, Jenny.

1:10:22.757 --> 1:10:24.424
I was really bad to say.

1:10:25.259 --> 1:10:26.928
But Mom was
a really good person.

1:10:28.062 --> 1:10:29.329
Her intentions were good.

1:10:31.032 --> 1:10:32.934
And I know that every single day

1:10:33.968 --> 1:10:35.435
women will take

1:10:35.468 --> 1:10:36.570
the word of a man

1:10:37.605 --> 1:10:38.906
over the word of a woman.

1:10:40.675 --> 1:10:41.909
Even if that woman
is their daughter.

1:10:44.946 --> 1:10:46.080
I didn't know that then,

1:10:47.048 --> 1:10:48.749
but I know it now.

1:10:48.783 --> 1:10:51.384
It will eat at my soul
for the rest of my life

1:10:51.418 --> 1:10:52.920
that I couldn't tell her that
before she died.

1:10:54.655 --> 1:10:56.389
But it's gonna be
the end of my life

1:10:57.792 --> 1:10:59.627
and the end of yours

1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:00.928
if we don't get out of here

1:11:01.729 --> 1:11:02.730
right now.

1:11:03.264 --> 1:11:04.866
I don't fucking care.

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:09.637
Do you even understand
what I'm feeling right now?

1:11:09.670 --> 1:11:11.371
Especially after
what just happened.

1:11:12.173 --> 1:11:13.307
So what?

1:11:13.341 --> 1:11:16.409
You're just gonna sit here
until they come and kill us?

1:11:16.443 --> 1:11:17.945
'Cause all those guys in there
with the guns.

1:11:18.913 --> 1:11:20.781
That's not the whole team.

1:11:28.055 --> 1:11:29.056
Fuck it.

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:34.427
I'm not gonna let you die

1:11:34.729 --> 1:11:35.763
alone

1:11:36.230 --> 1:11:37.530
like Mom.

1:11:48.910 --> 1:11:49.911
Fine.

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:13.834
Now what?

1:12:15.236 --> 1:12:16.469
I don't know.

1:12:16.503 --> 1:12:18.739
Now we should call the cops.

1:12:18.773 --> 1:12:20.808
A cop was the first person
I had to...

1:12:23.811 --> 1:12:25.146
...kill tonight.

1:12:25.179 --> 1:12:26.213
You killed a cop?

1:12:26.247 --> 1:12:27.348
He was drawing on me. Jenny,

1:12:27.381 --> 1:12:29.582
I didn't want to, even though
I had every reason to,

1:12:29.617 --> 1:12:30.818
especially after
what he did to you...

1:12:30.851 --> 1:12:31.953
Wait.

1:12:31.986 --> 1:12:32.987
Travis?

1:12:35.256 --> 1:12:36.456
He's dead?

1:12:53.808 --> 1:12:54.909
Hello.

1:12:55.743 --> 1:12:56.877
<i>Miss Nelson.</i>

1:12:56.911 --> 1:12:57.945
Who are you?

1:12:57.979 --> 1:12:59.213
<i>I write the checks,</i>

1:12:59.246 --> 1:13:01.048
<i>and right now
I'm writing checks</i>

1:13:01.082 --> 1:13:02.817
<i>to more men who will hopefully</i>

1:13:02.850 --> 1:13:05.886
<i>solve the problems
you created for me today.</i>

1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:07.254
There's always more men.

1:13:07.955 --> 1:13:09.924
<i>You don't have a play here</i>

1:13:09.957 --> 1:13:13.627
<i>other than running,
and I have a lot of eyes.</i>

1:13:13.661 --> 1:13:16.964
<i>I applaud your skill, though,
or should I say luck?</i>

1:13:16.998 --> 1:13:19.667
<i>But the luck will run out.</i>

1:13:19.700 --> 1:13:21.068
<i>We can find you
wherever you go.</i>

1:13:21.102 --> 1:13:22.803
<i>You and your little operation</i>

1:13:22.837 --> 1:13:24.805
<i>ruined a very
lucrative business</i>

1:13:24.839 --> 1:13:26.173
<i>that has been running out
of that property.</i>

1:13:26.207 --> 1:13:28.776
<i>Now we will have to relocate.</i>

1:13:28.809 --> 1:13:30.577
Should I let it play on,
Mr. Check Writer?

1:13:30.611 --> 1:13:31.645
Or do you get the point?

1:13:32.847 --> 1:13:34.749
<i>You have what you wanted.</i>

1:13:34.782 --> 1:13:38.085
<i>Your mother, sister.
And now you have collateral.</i>

1:13:38.119 --> 1:13:39.887
<i>I have a lot of bodies</i>

1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:43.090
<i>and two girls
threatening my business.</i>

1:13:43.124 --> 1:13:46.060
<i>How about we sit down and talk
before this gets worse?</i>

1:13:46.093 --> 1:13:48.129
Why the hell would I want
to sit down with you?

1:13:48.162 --> 1:13:49.764
<i>Who else is there?</i>

1:13:49.797 --> 1:13:50.998
<i>Do the math.</i>

1:13:51.032 --> 1:13:53.234
Okay, fine. But I want this
to be a grown-up conversation

1:13:53.267 --> 1:13:55.202
without a bunch of children
in grown-up costumes

1:13:55.236 --> 1:13:56.569
waving guns in my face.

1:13:56.603 --> 1:13:59.140
Can you do that?

1:13:59.173 --> 1:14:01.742
Are you the one man I meet today
who can talk to me

1:14:01.776 --> 1:14:03.244
like I'm an actual human being?

1:14:03.277 --> 1:14:04.378
<i>Scout's honor.</i>

1:14:04.412 --> 1:14:07.748
<i>Although I'd recommend against
any new gadget, please.</i>

1:14:07.782 --> 1:14:10.217
<i>One call and we'll have
a manhunt on</i>

1:14:10.251 --> 1:14:11.752
<i>for the killer
of a county deputy...</i>

1:14:11.786 --> 1:14:13.187
Woman hunt.

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:15.122
<i>Semantics
and political correctness,</i>

1:14:15.156 --> 1:14:16.657
<i>is that what we're doing now?</i>

1:14:16.690 --> 1:14:17.958
Just tell me when
and where, dude.

1:14:21.095 --> 1:14:23.130
<i>You have an address now.</i>

1:14:23.164 --> 1:14:24.732
<i>Condolences for your mother.</i>

1:14:25.433 --> 1:14:26.967
<i>See you tomorrow afternoon.</i>

1:18:31.245 --> 1:18:32.313
I'm full.

1:18:40.587 --> 1:18:41.822
Don't.

1:18:42.990 --> 1:18:43.891
I have to.

1:18:43.924 --> 1:18:45.926
You have no idea
what you're walking into.

1:18:46.927 --> 1:18:48.595
No. No, I don't.

1:18:50.030 --> 1:18:51.365
But he's the guy.

1:18:51.398 --> 1:18:52.433
Like 'the' guy

1:18:52.466 --> 1:18:54.168
Why don't we
just fuck off?

1:18:54.201 --> 1:18:55.469
Go to Europe for something?

1:18:55.502 --> 1:18:57.905
With what money, Jenny?

1:18:57.938 --> 1:19:00.341
If we ghost, he can get to us
if he wants to.

1:19:02.042 --> 1:19:03.444
Like, we're in a grace period
right now,

1:19:03.477 --> 1:19:04.478
so if we leave,

1:19:05.446 --> 1:19:08.382
he's gonna have the cops
come after us for, like,

1:19:08.415 --> 1:19:10.384
ten or 20 fucking murders.

1:19:12.419 --> 1:19:14.355
You realize this is
my only option, right?

1:19:15.389 --> 1:19:16.590
Our.

1:19:16.624 --> 1:19:17.759
Our option.

1:19:17.792 --> 1:19:20.060
You didn't do anything.
You had nothing to do with this.

1:19:20.094 --> 1:19:21.228
You're not meeting him alone.

1:19:21.261 --> 1:19:22.630
Yes, I am.

1:19:22.664 --> 1:19:24.632
If he decides
to chop my head off,

1:19:24.666 --> 1:19:26.133
I want you to take
the audio file

1:19:26.166 --> 1:19:27.601
and send it to everyone.

1:19:27.635 --> 1:19:30.337
Anderson Cooper,
the newspaper, whatever.

1:19:30.371 --> 1:19:33.207
And I want you to camp out
in the most public place you can

1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:35.576
and hope that
the least shitty cop shows up.

1:19:36.977 --> 1:19:38.312
If he's gonna kill us,

1:19:38.345 --> 1:19:39.380
the least that we can do

1:19:39.413 --> 1:19:41.415
is make his life
really difficult.

1:19:43.050 --> 1:19:44.051
Fuck.

1:19:47.154 --> 1:19:48.155
Fuck.

1:20:14.047 --> 1:20:15.349
Jenny?

1:20:23.223 --> 1:20:24.626
I know.

1:20:25.526 --> 1:20:28.195
No, you don't.

1:20:28.228 --> 1:20:30.665
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
that Mom didn't hurt me

1:20:30.698 --> 1:20:32.734
and piss me off.

1:20:32.767 --> 1:20:34.535
'Cause she did.

1:20:35.269 --> 1:20:36.270
Like, Mom and I

1:20:36.303 --> 1:20:38.606
both took Travis's side
at one point or another.

1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:41.643
I didn't wanna
sleep with him.

1:20:41.676 --> 1:20:44.411
- He got me drunk.
- I know. I know.

1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:47.548
He fucking raped you.

1:20:47.581 --> 1:20:49.283
He raped me, too.

1:20:49.316 --> 1:20:52.019
And I'm so, so sorry

1:20:52.052 --> 1:20:55.088
that I brought him
into our lives. Okay?

1:20:56.089 --> 1:20:57.759
I was stubborn,

1:20:57.792 --> 1:20:59.359
mostly because
part of me thought

1:20:59.393 --> 1:21:03.163
that I deserved
what he did to me.

1:21:03.197 --> 1:21:05.700
I cursed and prayed
until the moment she died.

1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:09.102
Because life fucking sucks.

1:21:10.537 --> 1:21:12.306
Yeah.

1:21:12.339 --> 1:21:14.174
And pride sucks, too.

1:21:16.076 --> 1:21:18.512
I've been too proud
to give anyone a second chance,

1:21:18.545 --> 1:21:20.447
especially myself.

1:21:22.182 --> 1:21:24.051
Alex...

1:21:24.719 --> 1:21:27.187
it's not your fault.

1:21:27.221 --> 1:21:29.156
I wish we had more time.

1:21:29.189 --> 1:21:30.658
We will.

1:21:31.626 --> 1:21:33.527
- We might...
- Hey...

1:21:34.595 --> 1:21:36.631
I love you.

1:21:36.664 --> 1:21:39.500
I haven't heard
that from you in...

1:21:39.533 --> 1:21:41.268
I don't even know
how many years.

1:21:42.770 --> 1:21:44.571
It didn't even hurt to say it.

1:21:49.276 --> 1:21:51.578
You don't have to do this.

1:21:54.481 --> 1:21:56.684
Look, I'm sorry
for everything, okay?

1:21:56.718 --> 1:22:00.187
- Five o'clock, that's the cut-off time.
- Alex...

1:22:44.866 --> 1:22:46.066
Get in.

1:23:23.871 --> 1:23:25.272
Get out.

1:23:30.712 --> 1:23:32.312
He's in there.

1:24:06.914 --> 1:24:08.215
Over here.

1:24:17.424 --> 1:24:19.426
You're much less intimidating
in person.

1:24:19.459 --> 1:24:22.496
That's exactly what
a not intimidated guy would say.

1:24:22.529 --> 1:24:24.431
Go ahead and have a seat.

1:24:30.570 --> 1:24:32.940
Definitely not intimidated.

1:24:34.408 --> 1:24:35.943
Now, you've seen
the sausage making

1:24:35.977 --> 1:24:38.345
of organ transplants laid bare.

1:24:38.378 --> 1:24:40.648
Organ transplants
for, uh, rich people.

1:24:40.682 --> 1:24:42.750
You have this much disdain

1:24:42.784 --> 1:24:45.318
for companies that offer
more exclusive versions

1:24:45.352 --> 1:24:47.855
of cars, or shoes?

1:24:47.889 --> 1:24:51.425
Are you really equating
body parts to shoes?

1:24:51.458 --> 1:24:55.562
- I figured you could relate.
- 'Cause all women just love them some shoes.

1:24:55.595 --> 1:24:59.232
All right, we'll skip the banter.
What do you want?

1:25:02.369 --> 1:25:04.471
I want you to stop...

1:25:04.504 --> 1:25:06.607
all of it, pack it all up.

1:25:07.709 --> 1:25:09.543
And leave.

1:25:15.582 --> 1:25:19.586
I'm a... big fan
of cost-benefit analysis.

1:25:20.855 --> 1:25:23.256
Seeing if something's
worth the hassle,

1:25:23.290 --> 1:25:24.959
even if it's a failure.

1:25:24.992 --> 1:25:27.729
I figured this meeting
wouldn't cost me much.

1:25:28.930 --> 1:25:32.867
Extra day, little moving around
of pieces.

1:25:32.900 --> 1:25:35.903
Maybe I wouldn't have to
totally reboot this thing.

1:25:36.838 --> 1:25:38.538
Save myself some money.

1:25:40.074 --> 1:25:41.909
Well, a lot of money
if we're being frank.

1:25:43.443 --> 1:25:46.614
That's what I thought
you're after, money, or...

1:25:46.647 --> 1:25:50.283
safe passage out of the country
or something.

1:25:50.317 --> 1:25:52.486
Maintaining discretion,
there's always...

1:25:52.519 --> 1:25:54.922
an amount or price.

1:25:54.956 --> 1:25:56.423
Wanting me to stop...

1:25:57.457 --> 1:25:59.660
Uh, maybe
this was a waste of time.

1:26:00.661 --> 1:26:01.829
I, uh...

1:26:02.864 --> 1:26:05.532
...don't see much benefit here.

1:26:07.467 --> 1:26:09.871
I'll be, uh...

1:26:09.904 --> 1:26:13.340
fine taking this hit.

1:26:13.373 --> 1:26:16.343
- I assure you...
- I'm telling you that you have a choice.

1:26:17.410 --> 1:26:19.981
A choice to be better...

1:26:20.014 --> 1:26:23.416
- Figured I'd be the first person to tell you...
- Choice?

1:26:23.450 --> 1:26:26.053
You don't give
out the choices, missy, I do.

1:26:26.087 --> 1:26:28.689
Can you at least leave
my sister alone?

1:26:28.723 --> 1:26:31.525
- She wasn't involved in this.
- She's very involved.

1:26:31.558 --> 1:26:35.328
She's involved, not vetted,

1:26:35.362 --> 1:26:39.767
and somebody
whose trustworthiness, well...

1:26:39.801 --> 1:26:43.004
- We just don't know about.
- Don't you have enough money?

1:26:43.037 --> 1:26:44.571
What do you
get out of this anyway?

1:26:44.604 --> 1:26:46.373
I don't think
you're my financial advisor,

1:26:46.406 --> 1:26:48.042
so I'm not gonna take
your advice on how much money

1:26:48.075 --> 1:26:50.745
I have or need, all right?

1:26:50.778 --> 1:26:52.647
I have worked too hard

1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:54.649
to just stop.

1:26:56.851 --> 1:26:58.385
Can we just get this over with?

1:26:58.418 --> 1:27:00.955
You're trying to
paint me as a monster,

1:27:00.988 --> 1:27:05.026
in charge of an army of monsters
doing monstrous things.

1:27:05.059 --> 1:27:07.094
You think the same of someone
who collects

1:27:07.128 --> 1:27:09.563
aluminum cans to recycle?

1:27:09.596 --> 1:27:13.366
That stuff is junk.
It'll just rot away in a landfill anyway.

1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:16.469
When people die and they
don't donate their organs,

1:27:16.503 --> 1:27:18.906
hair, skin, retina,

1:27:18.940 --> 1:27:20.641
where does that stuff go?

1:27:20.675 --> 1:27:22.743
It goes into a human landfill.

1:27:22.777 --> 1:27:25.512
We are putting that stuff
to good use.

1:27:25.545 --> 1:27:27.648
We are saving lives,
giving people

1:27:27.682 --> 1:27:30.985
the ability to walk or to see,
to live a few extra years, yeah!

1:27:31.018 --> 1:27:34.622
It's for people who can afford
it, but that's the world, honey.

1:27:34.655 --> 1:27:36.423
You remind me of my daughter.

1:27:36.456 --> 1:27:38.926
So confident...
in the idea she knows everything

1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:41.528
about things of which
she knows nothing.

1:27:41.561 --> 1:27:45.166
And when things don't work out,
she pouts and cries.

1:27:46.901 --> 1:27:49.904
This is why I don't hire women.
Women are...

1:27:49.937 --> 1:27:51.371
They're too emotional.

1:27:52.139 --> 1:27:53.741
They make mistakes.

1:27:53.774 --> 1:27:55.142
I don't think
I made mistakes today.

1:27:55.176 --> 1:27:57.879
Today, you got lucky.

1:27:57.912 --> 1:27:59.080
You really think
I'm stupid enough

1:27:59.113 --> 1:28:00.815
to let something like that
happen again?

1:28:00.848 --> 1:28:02.717
I don't know, maybe
ask your daughter.

1:28:02.750 --> 1:28:03.851
You don't know anything
about me,

1:28:03.885 --> 1:28:06.120
my daughter, or anything else.

1:28:06.153 --> 1:28:08.022
I raised my girl
to be three times

1:28:08.055 --> 1:28:09.156
the girl you are.

1:28:09.190 --> 1:28:11.893
I teach her, I protect her,
I make sure she doesn't...

1:28:11.926 --> 1:28:13.227
run around with the wrong guys.

1:28:13.261 --> 1:28:15.763
Wouldn't want her making her own
boyfriend decisions, would you?

1:28:15.796 --> 1:28:16.998
You of all people
should know that

1:28:17.031 --> 1:28:18.866
girls date the wrong guys
all the time

1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:19.967
and what they're after.

1:28:20.001 --> 1:28:22.469
Oh, so, you're like
the gatekeeper of her vagina?

1:28:22.502 --> 1:28:24.672
- Oh! Don't you dare talk about her...
- Her pussy?

1:28:24.705 --> 1:28:26.207
Her pussy
that you feel the ownership of.

1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:28.609
- Oh, you're pathetic!
- No, you're pathetic!

1:28:28.643 --> 1:28:31.212
What kinda man treats his
daughter like livestock?

1:28:31.245 --> 1:28:32.813
- That's not honorable.
- Oh, you don't know

1:28:32.847 --> 1:28:33.981
shit about honor.

1:28:34.015 --> 1:28:35.950
You're a life-long loser.

1:28:35.983 --> 1:28:37.985
You're sitting there
all self-satisfied,

1:28:38.019 --> 1:28:39.754
even though
you're one second away

1:28:39.787 --> 1:28:41.956
from being body parts
on my shelf

1:28:41.989 --> 1:28:44.659
and zeroes on my ledger.

1:28:44.692 --> 1:28:45.993
Would you sell
your daughter's body parts

1:28:46.027 --> 1:28:48.162
if she got a little lippy?

1:28:48.195 --> 1:28:49.964
Sell her genitals
if they were tainted

1:28:49.997 --> 1:28:51.498
by an unapproved man?

1:28:51.531 --> 1:28:53.868
Shut the fuck up!

1:28:53.901 --> 1:28:55.770
Stop acting like you know
how I run my family!

1:28:55.803 --> 1:28:57.038
I'm so sick of people like you.

1:28:57.071 --> 1:28:59.106
You think you know things.
You don't know shit!

1:29:00.007 --> 1:29:01.842
My family, this whole thing,

1:29:01.876 --> 1:29:03.844
I built it from the ground up.

1:29:03.878 --> 1:29:06.047
It starts and ends with me,

1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:07.882
you hear that,
you pathetic whore?

1:29:07.915 --> 1:29:09.984
- Me!
- Oh, look, now who's angry.

1:29:10.017 --> 1:29:11.652
Oh, you wanna know
what makes me angry, hmm?

1:29:11.686 --> 1:29:13.254
Bitches like you
who poke and prod!

1:29:13.287 --> 1:29:15.957
- You won't leave shit alone!
- I know dads like you.

1:29:15.990 --> 1:29:17.758
I know the shit
that you do to your daughters.

1:29:17.792 --> 1:29:19.760
You manipulate them.
You groom them.

1:29:19.794 --> 1:29:21.896
You brainwash them to think
you know better than they do.

1:29:21.929 --> 1:29:25.132
You make them second-guess their
life choices, their self-worth

1:29:25.166 --> 1:29:27.735
- and then you touch them.
- Oh, don't you dare imply

1:29:27.768 --> 1:29:29.837
I touch my daughter!

1:29:29.870 --> 1:29:31.504
Nothing like sex
with random dudes

1:29:31.538 --> 1:29:33.473
get the taste of daddy issues
out of your mouth.

1:29:34.541 --> 1:29:36.177
Say one more word...

1:29:36.210 --> 1:29:38.079
I fuckin' dare you!

1:29:38.112 --> 1:29:41.048
I will beat you
till you shit out of your bones!

1:29:44.785 --> 1:29:47.254
Women are too emotional.

1:29:59.700 --> 1:30:01.202
Here we go.

1:30:25.126 --> 1:30:26.627
You can walk away...

1:30:26.660 --> 1:30:29.130
you can walk away right now!

1:30:29.163 --> 1:30:32.299
You can get another job,
another life.

1:30:32.333 --> 1:30:35.002
You have that choice.

1:30:35.036 --> 1:30:37.171
But you need to make it
right now!

1:30:49.316 --> 1:30:50.718
All right.

1:32:33.020 --> 1:32:34.321
It's okay...

1:32:40.294 --> 1:32:42.062
Are we free?

1:32:42.096 --> 1:32:44.131
Like you ever had to ask.

1:33:16.797 --> 1:33:17.798
Alex.

1:33:25.272 --> 1:33:26.407
Stay here.

1:33:34.215 --> 1:33:35.849
Good morning, Ms. Nelson.

1:33:35.883 --> 1:33:38.219
It's just me here today.

1:33:40.554 --> 1:33:41.989
May I open the trunk?

1:33:52.032 --> 1:33:54.001
Now, you can look at this

1:33:54.034 --> 1:33:57.204
as a token, as an incentive
to keep quiet...

1:33:57.238 --> 1:33:59.940
- or as a signing bonus.
- For what?

1:33:59.974 --> 1:34:02.243
Excusing the man we allowed
to think was in charge.

1:34:02.276 --> 1:34:04.511
You shut down a chessboard.

1:34:04.545 --> 1:34:06.080
Not the chessboard.

1:34:07.014 --> 1:34:08.349
You kinda made mince meat

1:34:08.382 --> 1:34:11.151
out of a whole bunch of guys we
thought were good at their jobs.

1:34:11.185 --> 1:34:13.887
So, I've been sent
to offer you a position.

1:34:13.921 --> 1:34:17.258
- And we hardly ever offer positions to women.
- No, thanks.

1:34:17.291 --> 1:34:19.994
Look, we know
that you know things.

1:34:20.027 --> 1:34:21.829
And we also know
you're gonna keep quiet,

1:34:21.862 --> 1:34:23.998
because all of those murders,

1:34:24.031 --> 1:34:26.267
they can't all be
self-defense, right?

1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:29.003
These last few months,
you've been allowed to exist.

1:34:29.036 --> 1:34:31.205
That wasn't even guaranteed.

1:34:31.238 --> 1:34:34.108
Management sees you
as a non-issue right now.

1:34:34.141 --> 1:34:36.076
But turning down this offer

1:34:36.110 --> 1:34:38.445
may result in somebody
way up the totem pole

1:34:38.479 --> 1:34:40.080
changing their mind,

1:34:40.114 --> 1:34:41.849
and a whole bunch of guys
might come through here

1:34:41.882 --> 1:34:44.118
to clean up what's been
reclassified as "too risky."

1:34:44.151 --> 1:34:46.220
Good. Bye.

1:34:49.456 --> 1:34:51.025
You forgot your cash.

1:34:51.626 --> 1:34:53.027
That's your cash.

1:34:53.060 --> 1:34:54.395
I don't want it.

1:34:54.428 --> 1:34:57.031
That cash doesn't even
put a dent in our slush fund.

1:34:57.064 --> 1:34:59.333
Keep it.
Buy yourself something nice.

1:35:01.068 --> 1:35:04.204
Maybe upgrade to a place
that doesn't have four wheels,

1:35:04.238 --> 1:35:06.974
one of which is flat.

1:35:07.007 --> 1:35:08.442
We know
where you are at all times.

1:35:08.475 --> 1:35:10.544
There's really no reason
to rough it like this.

1:35:23.324 --> 1:35:24.558
Good luck!

1:35:45.045 --> 1:35:46.280
Do we have to go?

1:35:47.948 --> 1:35:49.483
Not if we don't want to.

1:35:56.523 --> 1:35:59.193
I'm reading one of the old books
in here.

1:35:59.226 --> 1:36:01.261
It's about World War II.

1:36:01.295 --> 1:36:03.063
There was this dude...

1:36:03.097 --> 1:36:05.532
who was a total fuck-up.

1:36:05.566 --> 1:36:08.670
Got discharged and they told him
to go kick rocks.

1:36:08.703 --> 1:36:11.271
But he signed back up
and they let him in.

1:36:11.305 --> 1:36:13.941
I guess, 'cause they needed
people real bad for the war.

1:36:13.974 --> 1:36:16.176
And he lied his way into
becoming the official hangman

1:36:16.210 --> 1:36:18.680
for the US military.

1:36:18.713 --> 1:36:21.115
You know it's "hanged" and not "hung"?

1:36:21.148 --> 1:36:24.184
Anyways, this dude,
he hanged, like, 100 people

1:36:24.218 --> 1:36:26.553
and was super proud of it.

1:36:26.587 --> 1:36:28.522
He bragged all over the place.

1:36:29.456 --> 1:36:31.392
He loved hanging people.

1:36:32.993 --> 1:36:34.561
Isn't that fucked up?

1:36:34.595 --> 1:36:35.697
Who makes out their career,

1:36:35.730 --> 1:36:37.531
like, who sits there as a kid
and says,

1:36:37.564 --> 1:36:40.100
"I wanna be a murderer
when I grow up."

1:36:43.036 --> 1:36:45.707
- What happened to him?
- Huh?

1:36:45.740 --> 1:36:48.175
The war ended.

1:36:48.208 --> 1:36:50.010
The hangman?

1:36:50.043 --> 1:36:51.111
What did he do?

1:36:52.747 --> 1:36:55.115
He was setting up some lights
on a military base...

1:36:55.149 --> 1:36:57.652
and electrocuted himself.

1:37:03.991 --> 1:37:06.460
Sometimes I wonder about
who our dads were...

1:37:06.493 --> 1:37:08.028
or are.

1:37:09.563 --> 1:37:11.298
Maybe one of them
is a sick bastard

1:37:11.331 --> 1:37:13.267
who wants to be a hangman.

1:37:13.300 --> 1:37:17.037
Or, like, is the guy who does
the lethal injections at prisons.

1:37:17.070 --> 1:37:19.039
I mean, it's not likely, but...

1:37:20.407 --> 1:37:22.576
I still do wonder
who they are sometimes,

1:37:23.444 --> 1:37:25.112
what their story is...

1:37:25.145 --> 1:37:26.614
you know?

1:37:30.050 --> 1:37:31.418
Who cares?
