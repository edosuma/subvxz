[Gerry claps]

00:10.385 --> 00:12.429
Guess who's going to Vegas
next week, spring break.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.055
This guy. Just booked it.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.599
What's going on? What's wrong?

00:15.599 --> 00:16.725
[Bobbi starts crying harder]

00:16.725 --> 00:17.893
What's wrong with her?

00:17.893 --> 00:19.394
It's Richard, Gerry,

00:19.394 --> 00:21.188
he died last night.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.357
-I'm sorry, I don't know who...
-Richard Thomas.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.776
He's one of our math
teachers, Gerry.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.820
-Was one of the math teachers.
-Oh my god.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.781
-You said "is".
-Gerry, that is not funny.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.950
Everyone loved Richard.
This is very sad.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.952
I'm not saying we
didn't love Richard.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.454
I'm saying, I don't really
remember Richard.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.914
So, Is there a funeral for this?

00:38.914 --> 00:41.041
-Tuesday.
-Tuesday?!

00:43.042 --> 00:45.337
Well, I don't see
anybody going to that

00:45.337 --> 00:47.756
during spring break.
So, that's that.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.718
We are all going Gerry.
All of us.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.887
Remember what I said
when I came in?

00:52.887 --> 00:56.015
I'm going to Vegas.
I'm not going to a funeral
during spring break.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.641
No chance. I'm sorry.

00:57.641 --> 00:58.934
I didn't even know
him that well.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.227
If I even remember who he was.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.854
I'm not even sure
I remember his face.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.104
He wouldn't care.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.523
And he won't know.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.775
We'll remember this
when you die Gerry.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.318
I'm pretty sure
if I do die first,

01:08.318 --> 01:09.987
I'm not going to die
during spring break.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.196
Or Easter break,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.240
or Christmas
break or summer.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.158
Because teachers are not
supposed to have

01:15.158 --> 01:17.953
funerals during those days.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.079
Unwritten rule!

01:19.079 --> 01:21.999
-Oh my god.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.896
Okay? That's Edna's coffee.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.856
-Who's Edna?
-Who's Edna?

01:45.856 --> 01:48.067
-Yeah.
-Only the schools biggest donor.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.778
Put it this way, seven years ago
she withdrew her funding...

01:50.778 --> 01:52.696
No sports for the
rest of the year.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.074
Is that what you want?
'Cause it's not what I want.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.577
Wow. How much does, this,

01:58.577 --> 02:00.037
Edna give to the school?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.538
Well, put it this way,

02:01.538 --> 02:03.123
if she withdraws her funding...

02:03.123 --> 02:05.250
I won't be here next year
and neither will you.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.544
Then why don't we just
get rid of you...

02:07.544 --> 02:09.170
And we don't need her money.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.965
[Robert laughs]

02:10.965 --> 02:12.340
I'm under so much pressure today

02:12.340 --> 02:13.801
I do not need this from you.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.385
Okay? So do me a favor,

02:15.385 --> 02:17.679
if you see us in the halls,
just make yourself scarce.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.348
Ohhh. 'Cause I'll screw it up,
is that what you think will
happen?

02:20.348 --> 02:22.726
-I'll screw up the donation?
-There's a good chance, yeah.

02:22.726 --> 02:25.228
Oh, okay. Alright.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.272
Okay. Let me take
some of that sugar.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.900
Bah, bah, that's Edna's sugar.
That's Edna's sugar.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.401
That's Edna's sugar.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.861
Why don't I take a little
bit of that milk?

02:32.861 --> 02:35.489
That's Edna moo juice.
Hands off.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.241
The rest of the coffee,
guess who's it is.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.952
It's Edna's.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.412
Well, I'll come by and find
Edna and say hi and thank you.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.205
Good luck finding us.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.377
It's not a big school you know.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.965
It's above average
in square footage.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.633
Hey Trudy, you were
looking for me?

02:54.633 --> 02:58.303
Yes, I need you to cover
Mr. Bondi's class again.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.805
Am I the only one
with his spare?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.515
'Cause you give me
coverage every day.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.934
I'm sorry, Lisa, but everyone
else is tied up, so...

03:03.934 --> 03:06.895
Well, could we hire
a substitute teacher?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.314
Oh, okay, good idea.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.400
Let's hire a substitute,
waste more money...

03:12.400 --> 03:15.278
So you can spend an hour
doing nothing on your spare.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.948
-I'm going to get right on that.
-I never do nothing.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.158
[Simon clears his throat]

03:19.158 --> 03:22.119
Trudy, you're looking radiant.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.245
Any coverage this period?

03:24.245 --> 03:27.206
Not for you, muffin.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.543
Oh, well.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.378
That's nice.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.505
Wait, he has a spare?

03:33.505 --> 03:35.340
Yeah, listen, that class
has already started.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.551
So you should probably scoot.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.100
Have a good one.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.309
[Trudy laughs]

03:48.687 --> 03:50.814
Excuse me.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.108
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.735
I would like you
to move your car

03:54.735 --> 03:56.028
out of my parking spot.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.279
These spots are
not assigned sir.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.115
They're for staff...

04:00.115 --> 04:02.325
Can you go around, please?

04:04.036 --> 04:05.537
I want you to get back
into your car

04:05.537 --> 04:07.581
and go park it
where the students park.

04:07.581 --> 04:11.085
Sorry. But there's nothing
that says I can't park here.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.128
Why do the teachers get
all the good parking spots?

04:13.128 --> 04:16.048
Exc...Go around!

04:16.048 --> 04:18.050
Oh, you did not just
walk away from me.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.177
I want you to get back
into your car

04:20.177 --> 04:23.931
and get it out of my spot.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.183
And this is
Mis...ter Duncan's class.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.350
So no need to, excuse us.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.394
No, no, no, no, come on in.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.938
Hi, this must be...

04:30.938 --> 04:34.608
-Ms. Donaldson.
-Oh please, call me Edna.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.944
Hello Edna, I've heard
so many great things

04:36.944 --> 04:38.653
about your philanthropy
to the school.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.530
Thank you so much.
I'd love you to meet my class.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.740
Love to meet the students.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.700
Everybody, this
is Ms. Donaldson,

04:43.700 --> 04:46.036
who donates a lot of
money to Xavier Academy.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.704
Please give her
a warm reception.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.665
[Students clap]

04:50.665 --> 04:52.251
Let me grab you a seat.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.962
Maya, can I have your seat
please, for Ms. Donaldson?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.546
-What?
-I want to give her your seat.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.714
Can you just get up and just
stand there please?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.049
You can't be serious.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.217
[Whispers] I'm serious,
get out of the seat

05:00.217 --> 05:01.676
and stand over there.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.428
-What is the big deal?
-This is ridiculous.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.388
Face the wall.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.433
We do not talk back to our
teachers here at Xavier Academy.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.061
[Edna] Oh.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.188
[Gerry whispers] Please
have a seat. Come on in.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.815
We run a tight ship here.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.734
-[Edna] Thank you Mr. Duncan.
-You are very welcome.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.279
I must admit,
I don't want to sound cheesy,

05:20.279 --> 05:22.322
but you bring a lovely
ray of sunshine...

05:22.322 --> 05:23.490
[Snaps fingers]

05:23.490 --> 05:24.950
...to the class. Thank you.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.328
-Ohh.
-Doesn't sound cheesy at all.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.664
But I'm afraid we must take
that little ray of sunshine
elsewhere.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.834
-Oh Robert, what's the rush?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.627
I'm enjoying this.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.378
She's enjoying this.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.632
Now, we were talking about
Winston Churchill.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.260
I know you're far to young to
remember Winston Churchill.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.427
[Edna giggles]

05:44.427 --> 05:45.887
Aren't you a delight?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.722
In fact, you blend in
so nicely with the kids,

05:47.722 --> 05:49.474
I can hardly tell you're here.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.643
Where is Ms. Donaldson? She was
just sitting here a minute ago.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.728
-[Robert] Gerry she...
-Where is Ms. Donaldson?

05:53.728 --> 05:55.480
-Has she...?
-Mr. Duncan,

05:55.480 --> 05:57.149
she's in the front row,
the one without the uniform on.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.026
-[Gerry] I know.
-You know, I think

05:59.026 --> 06:01.444
Mr. Duncan is single.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.238
Jimmy, get out.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.991
[Maya] Sir, can I have
my seat back?

06:05.991 --> 06:09.744
Maya! Face the wall,
nose to the wood.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.289
Ms. Donaldson,
we should really be off.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.126
It was lovely to
meet you children.

06:16.126 --> 06:20.005
-And you, Mr. Duncan.
-And you as well, Edna.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.465
-Giddy-up.
-Giddy-up.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.765
Could you pour me one of those?

06:30.765 --> 06:33.518
-Are you napping?
-Ahh, yeah.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.603
It's what I do on my spare,
why? What do you do?

06:35.603 --> 06:37.772
I'm stuck covering classes.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.858
Oh, hard to nap during that.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.240
I know what's going on here.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.866
What?

06:47.866 --> 06:49.450
The muffins for Trudy.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.203
You're bribing her.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.373
No. I give Trudy muffins
because she gives me a spare.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.707
No, she gives you a spare

06:55.707 --> 06:58.585
because you give her muffins.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.419
Well, it's sort of a chicken
and the egg thing huh?

07:00.419 --> 07:01.963
Which came first.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.966
I mean the chicken
'cause it laid the eggs.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.969
Where would the chicken
come from? Oh my god.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.181
I am onto you. Okay?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.308
Two can play at that game.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.227
Two.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.603
What game?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.230
What game are we playing?

07:18.230 --> 07:19.940
Well, guess who made

07:19.940 --> 07:21.816
quite an impression on Edna?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.777
Ah, well, I have a way with
the women, so thank you.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.780
Yeah, so much so in fact,
that she's now insisting

07:26.780 --> 07:28.698
you join us for dinner
tomorrow night.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.533
Well, look at that
and you thought

07:30.533 --> 07:33.287
I was going to screw it up.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.872
-No dinner.
-Oh, but yes you are.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.207
And I'll tell you why.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.000
See, we need her contribution.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.711
And in order to get that,
we need her to be happy.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.255
And the way to make her happy,

07:43.255 --> 07:47.592
is for us to have dinner
with her, tomorrow night.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.719
Fine, but you owe me a favor.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.264
Fine. You have a favor
in the favor bank.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.640
And you're buying me dinner.

K, I'll buy your dinner
and you owe me one.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.270
Deal.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.273
Robert, I forgot my
purse in your office.

You did? Allow me
to get it for you.

to our dinner, Gerry.

nightmare again.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.162
[Lisa laughs]

08:57.162 --> 08:59.039
Well, I'm off to see Trudy now.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.709
Not if I get there
first, witch.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.338
[Simon] Agh! Oh, oh.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.298
[Lisa laughs]

09:08.298 --> 09:09.549
I can't believe you
punched me in the throat.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.009
Believe it.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.726
Mmmm.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.317
I need you to cover
Mr. Gallagher's class.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.569
-[Simon] No, Trudy!
That's my spare.
-[Lisa] Yes! Yes!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.405
Well, I'm sorry but
we have to be fair.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.865
Ms. Mason has been
doing all the coverage.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.534
That's not what this is about.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.077
You liked her muffin better.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.828
[Lisa] It's a special recipe.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.123
Now, I'm going to go work
on my lesson for next week.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.583
That's what you do
with your spare?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.460
-That's what spares are for.
-No they're not.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.836
They're for napping.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.548
When am I supposed to
nap now, Trudy? Hmm?

09:49.548 --> 09:52.384
Thank you, Trudy. Bye Simon.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.344
-Ahhhh.
-[Lisa] Yeah.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.930
Come on Trudy,
give that another taste.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.357
[Simon takes a deep breath]

10:07.357 --> 10:09.401
Hey Mr. Cheeley. Ahhh.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.278
I know, you and I had
that meeting tonight?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.904
But I just wanted to let you
know, I'm not going to make it.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.573
'Cause I have to do some things
after school with Jimmy.

10:14.573 --> 10:18.493
To kind of help, elevate
his academics. So...

10:18.493 --> 10:20.412
Mr. Duncan, this meeting
is very important.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.038
I understand, but...

10:22.038 --> 10:23.664
I think our students here...

10:23.664 --> 10:24.832
It's correct, sir.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.503
I really need Mr. D to ah...

10:28.503 --> 10:29.921
[Jimmy] Ah...

10:29.921 --> 10:31.839
-I need Mr. D...
-You wrote it down?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.174
[Jimmy] I didn't want to forget.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.634
What is that word?
I can't read my writing.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
Help.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.763
Yeah, I really
need Mr. D to help.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.766
-Seven words.
-Yeah.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.602
-And you had to write it down?
-Yes, I did.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.479
[Robert]
Mr. Duncan, let me remind you,

10:45.479 --> 10:46.896
this dinner with Edna

10:46.896 --> 10:48.607
is very important to the school.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.317
So, I'll see you tonight.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.611
You're going on a
date with that lady?

10:52.611 --> 10:54.571
-Shut up.
-I just can't believe...

10:54.571 --> 10:57.031
Get out.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.908
Get out.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.495
Look, when you went
to get her purse,

11:01.495 --> 11:02.745
Edna slapped my bum.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.456
I'm not comfortable with a

11:04.456 --> 11:06.458
105 year old lady
slapping my bum.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.835
It doesn't mean anything, okay?

11:08.835 --> 11:09.836
I've had dinner with her

11:09.836 --> 11:11.463
every year for six years, now.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.714
She's never tried
anything on toward on me.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.758
There's a surprise.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.469
So, it's just going to be
a dinner?

11:17.469 --> 11:19.513
Yeah, that's it.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.973
-Alright.
-Let me ask you something.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.766
If it came down to it,

11:23.766 --> 11:26.520
you know...would ya?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.647
-Never, are you sick?
-Not for a million bucks,

11:28.647 --> 11:30.482
you wouldn't?

11:30.482 --> 11:32.484
For a million dollars,
I would have sex with you.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.486
Gerry!

11:34.486 --> 11:36.070
Thank you.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.280
Why don't you grow up?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.615
[Robert] I'll see you at 7:30.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.826
[Music playing]

11:41.826 --> 11:43.620
Can I come in?

11:43.620 --> 11:45.163
[Malik] Of course.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.917
-Working late?
-This happens.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.670
I need a favor.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.755
And I owe to you, seven.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.508
Yes, you do.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.759
I need supplies.

11:58.759 --> 11:59.927
I have many.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.888
And complete secrecy.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.517
I am a safe.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.311
Good. Okay.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.523
Do you have like a power saw?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.024
I don't.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.655
Oh, there she is.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.574
Looks like she brought a friend.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.783
What? I told you there was
something weird about this.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.495
She thinks it's a double date.
I am not staying for this.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.872
Hey, it might be another donor.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.166
She doesn't think it's a double
date and even if she does,

12:30.166 --> 12:32.126
it's two hours, for the school.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.796
Remember? You're here.
Just enjoy it.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.131
[Gerry] Fine.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.717
You take Edna,
I'll take the new one.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.386
Very funny.
I'm not taking anyone.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.803
Edna probably
wanted to fix me up

12:42.803 --> 12:44.055
with someone a little younger.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.098
[Robert] That makes sense.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.392
Hi.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.102
Can we get this
over with please?

12:49.102 --> 12:52.105
If you squint, you can't
even tell they're old.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.147
Try it.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.650
-No.
-Try it.

12:55.650 --> 12:56.693
-Still old.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.613
[Sound of drill]

13:04.825 --> 13:06.745
[Sound of drill]

13:13.668 --> 13:16.713
[Voice affected by tracheotomy]
How's your salad?

13:16.713 --> 13:17.880
Not great.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.758
You're not feeling well?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.843
Not really, I guess.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.721
Maybe I don't feel like eating.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.058
So, how do you two
know each other?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.603
Um, well, we were neighbours.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.147
And then once both
our husbands passed on

13:34.147 --> 13:35.482
we got a lot closer.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.899
-Didn't we? Yeah.
-[Edna] Mmm.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.859
[Robert] Well, I'm sorry
to hear that happened.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.528
But, I'm glad to see that

13:40.528 --> 13:41.988
something positive came of it.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.406
[Edna laughs]

13:43.406 --> 13:45.742
-[Doris] That's lovely.
-Yeah, because now,

13:45.742 --> 13:47.160
you know, we do a lot of this

13:47.160 --> 13:49.746
double date stuff together.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.081
[Doris laughs]

13:52.081 --> 13:54.626
The calamari's fabulous here.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.960
It's gluten free.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.087
[Gerry] Just a question, Doris.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.590
When you...

14:00.590 --> 14:03.718
When you eat how does
the food...does it...

14:03.718 --> 14:06.387
Does it go...

14:06.387 --> 14:07.305
I don't know what happens.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.724
-Gerry. Please.
-What?

14:09.724 --> 14:11.058
-[Robert] Gerry.
-You didn't want to know?

14:11.058 --> 14:12.935
Honestly honey, it's fine.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.853
Actually, I can eat.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.648
It's just that
I have to be careful

14:16.648 --> 14:18.232
because sometimes
it gets messy.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.610
So I have to cover the hole.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.738
[Robert]
In which case, ah, allow me.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.365
-No, Robert.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.075
[Gerry] Robert, please,

14:28.075 --> 14:29.952
please put your hand away.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.664
-Oh my.
-Bon appetit.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.666
-[Doris] Thank you.
-[Robert] Hands free eating.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.793
[Doris]
Lovely. What a gentleman.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.670
[Robert] Enjoy.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.754
[Doris giggles]

14:39.754 --> 14:43.216
-[Doris] Mmm.
-Oh, mmm. Yummy.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.720
-[Edna] How sweet.
-Thank you.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.848
Anyway, should we talk about
Xavier Academy now? And maybe...

14:49.848 --> 14:52.350
'Cause I gotta be somewhere
in an hour, so...

14:52.350 --> 14:54.101
[Edna] After dessert.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.603
That's when I decide

14:55.603 --> 14:57.021
if I will donate

14:57.021 --> 14:59.232
to the Academy again.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.693
Or not.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.987
I won't be having dessert,
I'll tell you that right now.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.824
Oh, give me a break.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.450
[Gerrry] No, not now.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.161
-What on earth? Jimmy!
-Hey.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.705
-This is our...are you okay?
-[Doris] Mmm.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.832
-Um, one of our star
students Jimmy.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.250
-Sir.
-At Xavier.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.793
-[Doris] Hello Jimmy.
-Hi.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.045
Hey Mr. D,
how's your date going?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.714
Not a date Jimmy.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.132
Ladies, you couldn't have
picked two finer gentlemen.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.009
[Jimmy]
I hope the night goes well.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.344
Bye, see ya later.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.179
You two make such a cute couple.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.682
Oooh, thanks.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.184
Okay, I'm not sure
he's being serious.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.729
You know, I'd never date someone
this age, right? You know that.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.814
-[Edna] Excuse me?
-Well, it's...

15:39.814 --> 15:42.776
Hey, just watch what you say
about my friend, dirtbag!

15:42.776 --> 15:44.903
You're not a prize
yourself, you know?

15:44.903 --> 15:46.905
Oh ya? And you're a real catch,
with a big hole in your neck.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.657
That's attractive. I can't
even eat my food, sorry.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.868
I had to say it,
someone had to say it.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.829
-Gerry, you apologize right now.
-[Gerry] What about her?

15:54.829 --> 15:57.707
What about her? Deep throat?
Huh? She started it.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.960
That's not...Oh, I'm
the bad guy. Okay.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.921
Oh yeah, I'm the bad guy.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.256
Well, have a great night folks.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.843
-Umm...
-This night is so over.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.428
Good, 'cause I'm going
to gag any minute.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.764
Kiss your money goodbye Robert.

16:12.764 --> 16:16.100
-I can...if...
-Goodbye jackass.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.020
-Can I drive you ladies home?

16:22.899 --> 16:25.234
[Music playing]

16:39.415 --> 16:41.250
Sir?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.919
Sir, you can't park
there anymore.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.045
[David] Read the sign.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.343
[Leung hums]

17:08.152 --> 17:09.570
Any questions?

17:10.822 --> 17:13.157
Before you go today,
thanks to Jimmy.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.909
The biggest donor in the history

17:14.909 --> 17:16.953
of Xavier Academy is no longer.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.455
So...you can expect less funding

17:19.455 --> 17:20.790
for your sports programs...

17:20.790 --> 17:23.292
Your music programs,
field trips.

17:23.292 --> 17:27.171
Probably less teachers,
so you'll have bigger classes.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.840
How do you feel
about that, Jimmy?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.926
-Who's the second old lady?
-A friend. So why...

17:31.926 --> 17:33.553
[Trudy on the PA]
Mr. Duncan, Mr. Callaghan

17:33.553 --> 17:35.179
would like to see you
after class.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.764
[Gerry] Yeah, I know.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.807
It's already happening, so...

17:37.807 --> 17:39.225
He's probably going to tell me

17:39.225 --> 17:41.101
that the graduation
formal's cancelled.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.812
Well, if it's not cancelled,

17:42.812 --> 17:44.981
maybe you can bring Edna.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.316
Get out.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.779
[Ben and Jimmy high five]

17:53.489 --> 17:55.575
-Really Ben?
-I just think

17:55.575 --> 17:57.451
it's funny you went on
a date with an old lady.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.246
'Cause you're such a Casanova.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.206
I don't even know
what that means.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.961
[Gerry claps]

18:06.961 --> 18:09.171
-It's just that it's so good.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.549
-Really? Aw, is it
really that good?

18:11.549 --> 18:14.010
-[Trudy] It is.
-Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.636
[Trudy] Mmm.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.137
Mr. Gallagher's still away.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.390
Actually Trudy, I was
hoping to give you this...

18:19.390 --> 18:22.060
$50.00 gift certificate
to Barrel's.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.686
Since I know how much
you like it there.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.606
Ohhh, I do like it there.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.732
[Trudy giggles]

18:27.732 --> 18:31.027
-This is great! Here.
-Oooh.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.738
Well, looks like it's
time for Simon's siesta.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.949
Simon, you're going to
spend a good chunk

18:35.949 --> 18:36.991
of what you earn today

18:36.991 --> 18:38.952
just to avoid covering a class

18:38.952 --> 18:40.036
for 40 minutes?

18:40.036 --> 18:42.038
That's right Lisa.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.248
Now you're cutting
into my nap time.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.043
You can't do this
everyday Simon.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.546
-Watch me.
-Ugh.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.633
-Watch him.
-Trudy, you can't do this.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.928
-Do what?
-Does Callaghan know about this?

18:56.928 --> 19:00.014
-Ummm, not verbally.

19:00.014 --> 19:03.476
How about, we'll get Gerry
to do the coverage?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.728
Trudy!

19:08.856 --> 19:11.818
Yeah, that works for me.
That's good.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.320
Give it to Gerry. Thanks.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.281
I love presents!

19:17.281 --> 19:19.117
[Music playing]

19:19.117 --> 19:21.243
[Gerry sighs]

19:23.121 --> 19:25.581
Look, I know I screwed up.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.167
When he comes in, I will
think of something, okay?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.586
We'll just say that she doesn't
want to donate anymore.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.588
It's been a lot...

19:32.588 --> 19:33.631
Or we'll say she's sick.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.049
I'll tell him that she's sick

19:35.049 --> 19:36.300
and she has to leave
the money for family.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.469
That's what I'll say.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.138
That might work.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.264
Look, whatever I say just
follow my lead. Okay?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.350
We'll have a story,
follow my lead.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.894
Guys, congratulations.
I don't know what you did,

19:46.894 --> 19:48.187
but whatever it was it worked.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.940
Edna's donated more
money than ever.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.317
-What?
-Yeah,

19:53.317 --> 19:54.986
said she had
the time of her life.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.570
I gotta get this to the
staffroom.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.615
I want to hear all about it.
I'll be right back.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.993
How is that possible?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.870
It was a horrible night.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.956
You had to drive them home,
they were so mad.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.792
Why would she donate more money?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.717
You drove them home.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.845
At the same time?

20:24.682 --> 20:29.311
No, you drove them home?

20:29.311 --> 20:32.356
You drove them both home?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.983
I don't want to talk about it.

20:33.983 --> 20:37.695
Oh my god Robert.

20:37.695 --> 20:40.614
How much do you love this place?

20:42.366 --> 20:43.659
Oh, sir. Come, meet
my grandmother her.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.703
Oh, hello grandmother.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.246
Mr. D, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.748
Nice to meet you too.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.249
And what do you teach Lucy?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.418
-Ah, I...
-Hey sir.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.504
-What did you teach Lucy?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.757
-Ah...Social Sciences.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.634
[Lucy's grandmother]
Oh, that's nice.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.472
Would you mind getting
the door for me, please?

21:12.438 --> 21:14.398
-Nope.
