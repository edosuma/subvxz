[PANTING]

20:54.419 --> 20:55.879
[WHIRRING STOPS]

20:55.963 --> 21:02.260
{\an1}HEY! WHAT DID
YOU TWO NITWITS

21:02.344 --> 21:04.054
DO TO MY SAW?

21:04.137 --> 21:04.972
SHE WAS POSSESSED
BY EVIL,

21:05.055 --> 21:08.850
BUT WE'RE SAFE NOW.
WE'RE ALL SAFE NOW.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.020
SHE WAS A BAD SAW. BAD.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.730
SHE WAS DEFECTIVE.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.816
{\an1}IT WAS A CORDLESS SAW
THAT HAD A SHORT

21:15.899 --> 21:18.193
{\an1}AND STARTED UP
WITHOUT WARNING.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.028
{\an1}THAT'S WHY IT WAS
IN A CAGE.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.822
I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT BACK
TO THE STORE FOR A REFUND,

21:21.905 --> 21:28.203
BUT NOW...I'M OUT 320 BUCKS!

21:28.286 --> 21:29.037
WE SHOULD STOP
BY MY OFFICE

21:29.121 --> 21:31.373
TO TALK ABOUT
YOUR ANGER ISSUES.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.040
WHAT?!

21:32.124 --> 21:34.584
OR I'LL JUST
PAY YOU BACK

21:34.668 --> 21:35.961
WITH FUNDS FROM MY
AROMATHERAPY BUDGET.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.505
AND I'LL
CLEAN UP THE SHOP.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.675
{\an1}GOOD. I'M EXPECTING
A V.I.P. HERE AT 3:00,

21:41.758 --> 21:44.720
AND I WANT IT SPOTLESS!

21:44.803 --> 21:46.346
AND KEEP AWAY FROM THIS.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.684
LAMEBRAINS.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.317
HERE.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.985
FLOWERS? FOR ME?

22:00.068 --> 22:02.571
{\an1}YES. AND I HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.156
AND I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HOW TO SAY IT.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.700
{\an1}SO I'M JUST
GOING TO SAY IT. I--

22:06.783 --> 22:08.243
BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING,

22:08.326 --> 22:10.787
I'VE GOT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.456
{\an1}YOU MADE ME
A ROCKING CHAIR?

22:12.539 --> 22:13.915
{\an1}I LOVE IT.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.626
{\an5}NO. I MADE
THE ROCKING CHAIR
FOR THE JUDGE.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.170
I HOPE HE LOVES IT.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.921
{\an1}I GOT TO SAY,
THIS WHOLE THING

22:20.005 --> 22:22.132
{\an1}TOOK ME BY SURPRISE,
BUT--JUDGE? WHAT JUDGE?

22:22.215 --> 22:25.552
RIGHT THIS WAY,
MR. BAUMGARTEN.

22:25.635 --> 22:26.094
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT IT EARLIER

22:26.178 --> 22:28.138
IN CASE
I DIDN'T FINISH.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.765
IF THIS GUY LIKES
MY CHAIR, I'M GOING

22:29.848 --> 22:31.099

WOODWORKING FINALS.

22:31.183 --> 22:35.479
OOH, THESE ARMS
MAKE THE PERFECT PAIR.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.814
OH, I WAS WAY OFF.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.567
SO, WHAT'S
WITH THE FLOWERS?

22:40.650 --> 22:44.071
{\an1}TO CHEER YOU UP,
US BEING FRIENDS AND ALL.

22:44.154 --> 22:44.863
HA HA...HA.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.907
CHEER ME UP
FOR WHAT?

22:46.990 --> 22:50.452
NOW LET'S HAVE A SEAT.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.584
THE CHAIR FAILS.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.462
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY CHAIR?!

23:00.545 --> 23:01.630
WAIT.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.800
CHEER ME UP?
YOU DID THIS!

23:04.883 --> 23:05.801
YOU LOST CONTROL
OF A SAW AGAIN,

23:05.884 --> 23:07.344
DESTROYED MY CHAIR,

23:07.427 --> 23:10.138
AND THOUGHT FLOWERS
WOULD MAKE UP FOR IT!

23:10.222 --> 23:11.681
{\an1}NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
BELIEVE ME.

23:11.765 --> 23:12.390
THEN LET ME GUESS.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.601
I SUPPOSE YOU
GOT ME THE FLOWERS

23:14.684 --> 23:15.477

YOU LIKE ME.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.397
{\an1}ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I CUT YOUR CHAIR. SORRY.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.401

TO RUN NOW.
