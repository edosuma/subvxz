03:34.417 --> 03:37.285
<i>Till number one.</i>

03:43.625 --> 03:46.242
<i>Till number one.</i>

03:52.625 --> 03:55.333
<i>Till number one.</i>

04:06.375 --> 04:08.583
Good morning, sir,
welcome to Waingel's Bank.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.374
My name is Sheila.
How can I help you?

04:21.458 --> 04:25.953
01632 960786?

04:26.042 --> 04:28.455
<i>- You all right?</i>
- Yeah, all right. You?

04:28.542 --> 04:30.784
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>
- Do you want me to get him?

04:30.875 --> 04:37.875
<i>- Uh, yeah.</i>
- Vince! Vince! Telephone!

04:38.583 --> 04:41.542
<i>- Is that Gwen?</i>
- No, your dad.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.367
- All right?
<i>- Don't ask. You?</i>

04:54.458 --> 04:56.370
<i>Yeah, you?</i>

06:09.833 --> 06:12.826
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- Going round Dad's.

06:12.917 --> 06:14.078
What about supper?

06:14.167 --> 06:16.204
What supper?
You didn't tell me anything?

06:16.292 --> 06:18.454
Don't give me that! Of course you knew.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.158
What else do I do every evening?

06:20.250 --> 06:22.242
Just put it in the fridge.
I can have it tomorrow.

06:22.333 --> 06:25.326
Vince, you are pushing me to the edge,
do you know that?

06:25.792 --> 06:28.375
Eat your dinner,
then you can go to your dad's.

06:28.458 --> 06:31.371
- Leave it out, Mum.
- Well, what are you going to eat?

06:31.458 --> 06:33.040
Stacy's making a curry.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.411
Who's Stacy?

06:34.500 --> 06:36.036
His new bird.

06:39.625 --> 06:40.741
He didn't tell you?

07:58.125 --> 08:00.117
Oh! Freezing out there!

08:00.208 --> 08:01.870
<i>I thought you'd be
back at six.</i>

08:02.500 --> 08:04.833
Long queue in the post office.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.876
You'd think it'd be empty
after Christmas.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.290
<i>Starving here!</i>

08:10.125 --> 08:13.698
Forgot already what you were
banging on about last night?

08:13.792 --> 08:15.158
Fridge dinners and all that?

08:15.250 --> 08:18.493
Or have you gone off
the idea of stale food...

08:19.583 --> 08:22.655
Oh, sorry.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.992
I didn't know you had company.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.204
How's it going, Gwen?

08:27.583 --> 08:31.156
<i>- She's modelling.</i>
- Pardon me, then.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.582
I'm cooking for three then, am I?

08:35.250 --> 08:39.494
- Gwen? Vince? Anyone?
- Yes, please.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.491
Have you offered her anything?

08:42.125 --> 08:43.616
We only just started.

08:44.542 --> 08:46.625
Gwen, would you like a drink?

08:52.083 --> 08:53.083
Let's have a look.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.869
Very good!
He's made you look really lovely, Gwen.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.245
I wish I had that talent.

10:24.292 --> 10:29.208
<i>You've reached 01632 960786.</i>

10:29.292 --> 10:31.750
<i>I'm not in right now,
but if you leave a message,</i>

10:31.833 --> 10:33.165
<i>I'll get straight back to you.</i>

10:34.583 --> 10:39.703
<i>This is a message for Sheila.
It's Adonis. Box number 1592.</i>

10:39.792 --> 10:42.535
<i>I got your letter and your photo.</i>

10:42.625 --> 10:44.161
<i>I've got a few other dates this week,</i>

10:44.250 --> 10:46.330
<i>but give me a call
and I'll see if I can slot you in.</i>

10:46.750 --> 10:51.120
<i>My number is 01632 960322.</i>

11:14.625 --> 11:16.617
<i>A purchase on a horizon,</i>

11:16.708 --> 11:18.916
a panoply of temptation.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.536
Can a curious soul desist?

11:20.958 --> 11:23.075
I'm just looking, thank you.

11:23.458 --> 11:26.371
The hesitation in your voice
soon to be an echo

11:26.458 --> 11:29.292
in the recesses
of the spheres of retail.

12:04.875 --> 12:08.789
Imagine, 60 percent vanished
from this sensational garment.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.198
In apprehensions
lie the crevices of clarity.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.829
<i>Isn't it a little risqué?</i>

12:17.917 --> 12:21.706
A provocation.
For what else must one wear?

12:21.792 --> 12:23.909
I'm just going on a date.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.998
A date? Well? And what kind of date?
Food and drinks?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.995
Food and drinks, yeah.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.621
An embellishment of occasion,
for instance,

12:35.708 --> 12:38.451
but also the emphasis
of comfort and pleasure.

12:39.042 --> 12:42.740
Thus you will destroy two birds
with a stone.

13:27.417 --> 13:30.455
Imagine, the dress is your image

13:30.542 --> 13:34.707
and from me onto what you project
through an illusion.

13:37.375 --> 13:42.621
One sensation of mind,
one fabric in recollection of touch.

13:44.125 --> 13:47.197
But this is how I see
your night romance.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.704
I predict the fantasy.

13:50.375 --> 13:53.823
Isn't it small? What size is this?

13:54.375 --> 13:55.491
Thirty-six.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.199
But I'm not a thirty-six.

13:59.708 --> 14:03.577
In a number is only
the equation of actuality.

14:04.167 --> 14:08.366
Dimensions and proportions transcend
the prisms of our measurements.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.367
You're not getting any more in?

14:16.292 --> 14:21.242
There's a lucky man somewhere
in the vista of this mysterious mirror.

14:22.375 --> 14:23.786
May I ask his name?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.037
His name's Adonis.

14:27.125 --> 14:30.789
Adonis? I see him.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.332
I like him.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.990
And it's not clinging too tightly here?

14:40.083 --> 14:43.906
Desist warning attention
to the askew perception of self.

14:44.875 --> 14:48.164
Lightest trivia
and the local vectors of frivolity

14:48.250 --> 14:51.209
are the topics
Adonis will be discussing tonight.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.333
I don't normally wear
this kind of thing.

14:55.833 --> 14:59.702
Darings eclipse
the dark circumference of caution.

15:00.875 --> 15:04.619
Be bold.
Your date will compliment you.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
Touch it.

15:39.583 --> 15:40.699
Feel it here.

15:58.625 --> 16:03.825
And may I interest you in other desired
supposes in our exclusive boutique?

16:03.917 --> 16:06.534
I'm fine for now, thank you.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.163
Then I would like you to announce
your locus of residence

16:09.250 --> 16:11.958
followed by the numbers
to your telephone.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.332
Sheila Woolchapel,

16:14.417 --> 16:18.787
16 Ferndale Road,
Thames Valley-on-Thames.

16:18.875 --> 16:25.031
01632 960786.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.953
Thank you.

17:24.416 --> 17:27.615
The pleasure is all mine,
Sheila Woolchapel.

17:27.708 --> 17:32.032
Adonis will be waiting
and he will compliment you.

17:36.792 --> 17:39.785
<i>Till number one.</i>

17:42.375 --> 17:44.742
<i>Till number one.</i>

18:27.750 --> 18:30.458
<i>Sheila Woolchapel,</i>

18:30.542 --> 18:35.162
16 Ferndale Road,
Thames Valley-on-Thames.

18:35.250 --> 18:36.457
Telephonic code:

18:36.542 --> 18:43.542
<i>zero and one and six and three
and two and nine and six and zero</i>

18:44.375 --> 18:48.494
and seven and eight and six and stop.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.697
<i>Well, maybe I can actually,
you know...</i>

18:55.083 --> 18:56.699
No, I'm not.

19:00.625 --> 19:04.164
I'm off. Your dinner's in the fridge.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.415
<i>What have you done to your hair?</i>

19:10.667 --> 19:11.667
Why?

19:12.500 --> 19:13.832
Looks like the council cut it.

19:14.833 --> 19:15.914
Thanks.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.665
You're not dating, are you?

19:19.667 --> 19:22.330
Why? Aren't I allowed to?

19:22.417 --> 19:23.578
Bit soon?

19:24.042 --> 19:26.375
I didn't know
there was a time limit.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.074
I thought you wanted
to get back with Dad.

19:29.167 --> 19:34.333
That was a while ago,
and obviously your dad had other ideas.

19:36.458 --> 19:41.999
Oh, and tell that femme fatale of yours
to get off the phone.

19:42.083 --> 19:44.166
It's gonna cost me a fortune.

19:48.042 --> 19:54.118
<i>You've reached 01632 960786.</i>

19:54.208 --> 19:58.578
<i>I'm not in right now, but if you leave
a message I'll get straight back to you.</i>

20:00.125 --> 20:02.208
<i>It's Adonis again.</i>

20:02.292 --> 20:05.831
<i>Amesos Greek restaurant, 7:30.</i>

20:05.917 --> 20:09.786
<i>I'll be wearing a dark Donningtonio suit
and carrying a rose.</i>

20:09.875 --> 20:14.290
<i>I'm tall, slim, short back and sides.</i>

20:14.375 --> 20:17.083
<i>If you don't find me, I'll find you.</i>

21:33.792 --> 21:34.792
Oh!

21:34.875 --> 21:37.618
<i>- Box number 1592?</i>
- Yeah.

21:37.708 --> 21:40.667
<i>- Did I scare you?</i>
- No, it's fine.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.709
<i>I've got some love vouchers
that will give us ten percent off</i>

21:43.792 --> 21:45.408
as long as we share the same pudding.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.699
Pudding? Sounds good. Join me.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.583
- As promised.
- Oh, thank you.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.162
- What?
- You look different.

22:20.708 --> 22:21.824
How?

22:22.750 --> 22:24.036
Well, your hair.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.790
Hair grows back.

22:45.292 --> 22:48.660
- Do you know what you're having?
<i>- In a minute, OK?</i>

22:49.583 --> 22:51.119
The moussaka looks good.

23:06.375 --> 23:08.458
<i>So, you like dancing then?</i>

23:09.792 --> 23:11.749
Not tonight, I sprained my ankle.

23:11.833 --> 23:15.952
God, I didn't mean tonight.
Just in general. You like dancing?

23:16.042 --> 23:17.042
Yeah.

23:24.083 --> 23:27.906
It says in your lonely hearts
advertisement that you like laughing.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.083
Yeah.

23:32.417 --> 23:33.578
What kind of things?

23:34.125 --> 23:35.866
Funny things.

23:35.958 --> 23:39.201
- What about cooking?
- What is this, an exam?

23:42.542 --> 23:44.408
<i>Friendly evenings, guests.</i>

23:44.500 --> 23:47.664
Welcome to Amesos.
My name is Vlassis and you are?

23:48.958 --> 23:50.574
Sheila Woolchapel.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.165
Adonis Jackson.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.583
<i>And may I take
your lucky orders?</i>

23:59.333 --> 24:00.333
Madam?

24:00.833 --> 24:04.622
Oh, there will be the tzatziki
for the starter

24:04.708 --> 24:08.031
and vegetable moussaka for the main.

24:08.125 --> 24:10.333
Instantly, madam. You, sir?

24:17.083 --> 24:20.076
<i>Um...</i>
I will come back for your lucky order.

25:02.792 --> 25:09.323
Vince? Vince? Get a move on.
I'm desperate. Vince?

25:13.500 --> 25:16.993
Sorry, I didn't know
you were staying over.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.574
<i>Didn't Vince tell you?</i>

25:19.750 --> 25:21.491
Well, maybe I didn't hear.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.040
I hope it's not a problem.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.866
Of course not, no.

25:26.042 --> 25:27.078
Nice night out?

25:27.167 --> 25:30.160
Yes, thank you. Caught up with a friend.

25:30.250 --> 25:33.368
Where's Vince?
He didn't answer when I called him.

25:33.875 --> 25:36.458
He must've knocked himself out.

25:36.542 --> 25:41.116
It's always the way with him. As soon as
he comes, he's out for the count.

25:41.208 --> 25:44.406
Must be the pressure
of those mock exams.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.991
It should get better by February.

25:47.542 --> 25:49.499
Did you get anything nice in the sales?

25:49.583 --> 25:50.994
Not much. You?

25:51.083 --> 25:53.621
I found a very tasteful
pair of Carpathian stockings

25:53.708 --> 25:57.406
from Dentley and Soper's.
Seventy percent off.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.500
Now that's what I call a bargain.

26:01.542 --> 26:03.283
I'm sorry
if I was too long in the shower.

26:04.042 --> 26:06.955
I won't keep you waiting
as I know you're desperate.

28:00.625 --> 28:03.242
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- You tell me.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.746
- How did this end up in here?
<i>- Eh?</i>

28:06.333 --> 28:09.371
The next time your girlfriend
wants to try something on,

28:09.458 --> 28:11.245
how about asking me first?

28:11.333 --> 28:13.996
<i>- You got a screw loose?</i>
- Don't talk to me like that.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.575
<i>Gwen wouldn't be seen dead
in something like that.</i>

28:16.667 --> 28:19.375
- So how did it end up in there, then?
- How would I know?

28:19.458 --> 28:21.871
I don't like people
going through my things, Vince.

28:21.958 --> 28:25.907
- Touché! Neither do I.
- Don't you touché me.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.198
I've had enough of her
making a mini-bar from my wine

28:29.292 --> 28:32.126
and now helping herself to my wardrobe.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.531
She's turning my house into a boudoir
and I'm not having it.

28:35.625 --> 28:38.333
It's becoming a bit disgusting
if you must know.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.417
Leave it out, Mum.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.787
No, I'm not going to leave it out,
young Vincent.

28:41.875 --> 28:45.198
I'll say it again
because nothing gets through your head.

28:45.292 --> 28:49.036
To be frank,
I find Gwen a bit disgusting.

28:49.750 --> 28:52.788
And the sooner
you take that on board, the better.

29:17.917 --> 29:18.917
<i>Hello.</i>

29:53.042 --> 29:54.908
<i>I hope you didn't move
without me.</i>

29:55.000 --> 29:56.582
Don't get paranoid, Mum.

29:57.292 --> 29:59.705
Now where were we?

29:59.792 --> 30:01.374
Your turn, Don Juan.

30:18.542 --> 30:20.955
- Oh, my God, what's that?
- What?

30:21.792 --> 30:23.249
That looks nasty.

30:24.167 --> 30:25.703
Just some sort of rash.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.533
Ugh, I hope it isn't catchy.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.457
Yeah, what is that?
I saw it the other day.

30:29.542 --> 30:34.162
I don't know. An allergy of some sort.
Maybe the washing powder.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.913
- You should get it looked at, Mum.
- Don't scare me.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.914
I'm not scaring you. Just get a cream
and Bob's your uncle. For your sake.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.287
<i>My financial advisor
had something similar.</i>

30:43.375 --> 30:45.537
Some kind of blood infection.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.491
Ended up having to
amputate her right arm.

30:47.583 --> 30:50.371
<i>- Don't give me that.</i>
- Seriously!

30:50.458 --> 30:53.326
The doctor kept sending her
home saying it was some kind of allergy

30:53.417 --> 30:55.033
and she ended up really ill.

30:56.250 --> 30:58.458
But it's fine now.

30:58.542 --> 31:01.740
She eventually learnt to write
left-handed.

31:01.833 --> 31:04.120
Beautiful handwriting too.

31:04.958 --> 31:05.994
Your turn.

31:25.333 --> 31:26.824
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

31:30.833 --> 31:32.574
Tough decision.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.499
Do you have to talk French all the time?

32:13.083 --> 32:15.245
He has to practise for his A levels.

32:26.583 --> 32:27.790
Actually.

32:31.375 --> 32:34.083
Sorry.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.783
<i>What was that?</i>

32:42.333 --> 32:44.541
<i>- Turn it off.</i>
- I've turned it off!

32:44.625 --> 32:46.116
Pull the plug out!

32:50.250 --> 32:53.664
Sit on it or something! Oh!

32:59.958 --> 33:01.119
<i>Mum!</i>

33:15.458 --> 33:16.915
What's going on with this thing?

37:51.042 --> 37:53.750
<i>Till number two.</i>

37:58.250 --> 38:00.037
<i>Thanks for coming in, Sheila.</i>

38:00.125 --> 38:03.368
Look at that, still finding
pine needles everywhere.

38:03.458 --> 38:07.327
All over our sofa back home as well.
Must get a plastic tree next year.

38:07.417 --> 38:09.500
Yeah, we must. How's it going, Sheila?

38:09.583 --> 38:11.575
- Yeah, everything's fine.
<i>- Ah.</i>

38:12.000 --> 38:13.411
What happened to your hand?

38:13.500 --> 38:16.868
Nothing much.
Washing machine went bananas.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.666
Well, we know a very good repair company
if you need anyone.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.618
- What's that, Staverton's?
- Yeah. Staverton's Wash. In your area.

38:22.708 --> 38:24.809
They did wonders with our machine,
didn't they, Clive?

38:24.833 --> 38:26.916
Yeah, they did.
A really good mechanic.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.493
So how are things going? Do you feel
on top of things at the moment?

38:30.583 --> 38:32.370
Yeah, I think so.

38:32.458 --> 38:35.417
We didn't see you
at the Christmas bowling the other week.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.992
Oh, I think I had a lot on
with my son that night.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.120
Hmm. Interesting.

38:40.208 --> 38:43.622
Sheila, Pete Mathinson
spoke to us the other day.

38:43.708 --> 38:47.201
Now he's really impressed with how
you're all doing. Lots of good feedback.

38:47.292 --> 38:50.706
Yeah, he also noticed how attuned you
were to the Waingel's Wavelength.

38:50.792 --> 38:53.125
Yeah. One thing he flagged
with us though.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.245
He wasn't sure about your handshake.

38:57.125 --> 39:00.038
Pete thinks you're doing really well,
likes the way you smell as well,

39:00.125 --> 39:03.197
but to tell you the truth,
the handshake did come up

39:03.292 --> 39:07.491
and Pete commented on how
perhaps it wasn't meaningful enough.

39:08.042 --> 39:10.955
Sheila, Pete wanted you
to have this article here.

39:11.042 --> 39:14.331
Um... It's about the importance
of a meaningful handshake.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.283
Sure, I'll take a look.

39:16.375 --> 39:18.207
<i>It's written
in a fun, easy language</i>

39:18.292 --> 39:21.035
and there's a cartoon at the end
that summarises the key points.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.768
And Sheila, if you want, we'd be happy
to try out a role-play scenario

39:23.792 --> 39:26.660
- which involves handshaking.
- It doesn't have to be a bank scenario.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.630
We have a range of costumes
we could all try on.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.034
- It's OK, I'll practise at home.
- Hm.

39:31.417 --> 39:33.830
One other thing, Sheila.

39:33.917 --> 39:38.241
One of your colleagues noticed
that you tend to visit the ladies' room

39:38.333 --> 39:40.825
prior to clocking out for feeding time.

39:41.917 --> 39:43.499
Who told you this?

39:43.583 --> 39:45.791
It wouldn't be professional of us
to say her name.

39:45.875 --> 39:49.539
I normally clock out
and instantly leave the building.

39:49.625 --> 39:51.412
Well, if it's a one-off we understand,

39:51.500 --> 39:54.618
but we just wanted to flag it up
with you, in case Pete finds out.

39:54.708 --> 39:56.540
A minute or two
might not seem significant,

39:56.625 --> 39:58.457
but when we spoke to your colleague,

39:58.542 --> 40:01.535
she did some calculations
and rightly reminded us

40:01.625 --> 40:04.914
that if these unwarranted toilet visits
were to take place

40:05.000 --> 40:07.333
at an estimate of
two minutes per visit,

40:07.417 --> 40:11.081
you would accrue
over four hundred minutes every year.

40:11.167 --> 40:14.490
And to tell you the truth, two minutes
for a visit to the toilet is generous.

40:14.583 --> 40:16.825
Well, in my experience
it's two and a half.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.749
I timed myself
right before this meeting.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.497
It was a one-off,
I can assure you.

40:23.083 --> 40:26.121
Whoever it was who informed you
of my transgression

40:26.208 --> 40:30.999
obviously doesn't notice
that I'm regularly in ten minutes early.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.166
Maybe you could do the maths on that.

40:34.583 --> 40:37.417
- What do you think?
- Is fantastic.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.991
And the shawl?

40:39.083 --> 40:42.702
The shawlest vantage
praises January customer

40:42.792 --> 40:47.912
for she is in purchase
of our sacred domain. Cheers.

40:50.125 --> 40:52.037
It's a little tight
around the shoulders.

40:52.125 --> 40:54.959
I knew I'd need a size up
after Christmas.

40:55.042 --> 40:58.581
When your stature is emphasised,
it is my duty to provide you

40:58.667 --> 41:03.207
with a notion of proportion
that reflects your ideal of dimension.

41:03.292 --> 41:04.703
Wait here.

41:38.458 --> 41:41.496
Our perspectives
on the spectres of mortality

41:41.583 --> 41:45.702
must not be compromised
by an askew index of commerce.

41:50.958 --> 41:51.958
I'm sorry.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.583
The model, the affliction.

41:56.417 --> 41:57.533
What happened?

41:59.250 --> 42:01.037
A calamity.

42:01.125 --> 42:05.495
Imagine. Jill Woodmere. Yes, she.

42:05.583 --> 42:09.406
Our range in garments she defined
through a rapture of display.

42:10.542 --> 42:15.162
And here, the last dress she wore.
Oh, how she adored it.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.741
I'm sorry.

42:34.667 --> 42:36.329
The rhombic coat?

42:37.625 --> 42:40.743
The rhombic coat, yes. I'll try it on.

42:41.208 --> 42:43.700
Sorry, one last thing.

42:43.792 --> 42:46.455
How many of those
dresses were in stock?

42:46.542 --> 42:49.159
One. Only the one.

42:49.750 --> 42:52.493
And the model wore that same dress?

42:53.167 --> 42:58.913
Yes. But imagine, she extensively
showered before that photograph.

44:53.542 --> 44:54.908
<i>Vince?</i>

44:56.958 --> 44:58.199
Vince?

45:58.208 --> 46:02.282
Zach? Sheila, box number 6832.

46:05.042 --> 46:08.410
I have some love vouchers here
with some exciting discounts.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.288
That's if you don't mind
sharing a pudding with me.

46:57.375 --> 47:00.163
<i>- You look familiar, you know?</i>
- Oh, no, don't scare me.

47:00.250 --> 47:03.698
Seriously, I've seen you somewhere
before, I don't know where, but...

47:03.792 --> 47:04.999
Do you bank at Waingel's?

47:05.458 --> 47:07.871
Ah, I thought it was
something like that.

47:08.583 --> 47:11.906
I remember now.
You fined me for going over my limit!

47:12.000 --> 47:15.914
Oh, not me, I don't fine.
I just follow orders from above.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.953
I think I still have a letter from you

47:18.042 --> 47:20.580
asking me to make an appointment
with your managers.

47:20.667 --> 47:23.410
You were kind of stern, but I liked it.

48:11.042 --> 48:14.001
What happened? What happened?

48:14.083 --> 48:16.826
<i>It's OK, it's OK.</i>

48:16.917 --> 48:20.285
<i>Come here, it's OK.</i>

48:35.542 --> 48:38.376
It's hard to make friends in this town.

48:38.458 --> 48:39.790
I know.

48:42.458 --> 48:43.744
Is it just me?

48:44.667 --> 48:47.284
No, it's OK. Don't think about it.

48:49.292 --> 48:52.865
It's hard to make friends here,
it really is.

48:56.625 --> 48:59.368
You met many others through this?

49:00.500 --> 49:02.913
A few. You?

49:04.167 --> 49:06.079
One or two.

49:09.417 --> 49:11.875
I don't need to meet anyone anymore.

49:13.125 --> 49:14.125
Me neither.

51:08.125 --> 51:11.243
"You who wear me will know me."

51:12.250 --> 51:13.707
What's that supposed to mean?

51:13.792 --> 51:15.533
<i>It's just a design feature.</i>

51:15.625 --> 51:17.036
Cheap bit of mystery.

51:18.125 --> 51:21.038
You think anyone buying these things
gives a damn what it all means?

51:23.583 --> 51:25.324
Would you think I'm bonkers

51:25.417 --> 51:27.955
if I told you I think something's wrong
with that dress?

51:28.042 --> 51:29.078
<i>Of course not.</i>

51:29.167 --> 51:32.740
I haven't met a woman who didn't think
there was something wrong with a dress.

51:36.167 --> 51:38.625
A woman who modelled it died.

51:39.375 --> 51:43.289
And? Half the clothes I bought in the
charity shop are from people who died.

51:44.417 --> 51:47.034
Don't run yourself around
all this hocus pocus.

51:47.125 --> 51:48.707
Personally, I like you in it.

51:49.667 --> 51:51.158
- Really?
<i>- Yeah, really.</i>

51:51.667 --> 51:54.375
- You're not just saying that?
<i>- You look good in it.</i>

51:55.375 --> 51:57.583
OK, you look good in most things,

51:58.083 --> 52:01.406
but that dress definitely shows you off.

52:04.542 --> 52:05.874
Put it on.

52:10.917 --> 52:13.500
Don't tell me you're scared of a dress?

54:46.458 --> 54:48.290
<i>You don't want to go
into town today?</i>

54:48.375 --> 54:49.911
Oh, it's a nightmare on Saturdays.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.539
Why don't we stay here?
You know, acclimatise you to Vince.

54:53.958 --> 54:55.290
No one's rushing you there.

54:56.250 --> 54:59.493
I just think it'll be good for him
to see me back on my feet a little bit.

55:00.417 --> 55:02.249
He was a little short with me
on the phone.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.370
He's in a bad way.

55:04.458 --> 55:06.450
The separation really got to him.

55:06.542 --> 55:09.125
Not helped by my ex
trying to pit him against me.

55:09.208 --> 55:10.949
<i>- Join the club.</i>
- Darren!

55:13.542 --> 55:16.000
- No!
<i>- Darren, get off!</i>

55:16.083 --> 55:18.325
Get off! Get off, Darren!

55:19.750 --> 55:21.742
Darren, get off!

55:22.125 --> 55:26.495
<i>- Get off! Get off!</i>
- My leg!

55:26.583 --> 55:27.994
Get it off!

55:29.708 --> 55:32.667
<i>Darren, you bastard! Darren!</i>

55:32.750 --> 55:35.709
<i>Mum!</i>

55:37.708 --> 55:39.199
- Mum!
- Up here!

55:40.833 --> 55:42.574
<i>Took me ages to get your stuff!</i>

55:42.667 --> 55:45.956
They asked for my ID and everything
then they gave me some punk's rucksack.

55:46.042 --> 55:47.374
I've no idea why they...

55:48.250 --> 55:50.833
Vince, this is Zach.

55:51.542 --> 55:53.078
A friend from work.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.081
Pleased to meet you.

55:55.167 --> 55:58.410
All right. Where do you want me
to put these, then?

55:58.875 --> 56:01.458
No point, they're all ripped to pieces.

56:01.542 --> 56:04.535
Eh? This one's not ripped.

56:04.625 --> 56:08.289
- Of course it's ripped.
- It's brand spanking new, almost.

56:12.083 --> 56:13.824
It should be ripped.

56:13.917 --> 56:16.751
The dog ripped it to pieces.
It should be ripped!

56:16.833 --> 56:19.621
I tell you, it should be ripped!

57:14.458 --> 57:19.658
I have reached the dimension of remorse,
Sheila Woolchapel. The dress.

57:19.750 --> 57:23.369
I can't claim with its reacceptance
if its purchase is not evidenced.

57:23.458 --> 57:25.040
I had the receipt.

57:25.125 --> 57:26.787
I don't know where it's gone.

57:33.875 --> 57:36.458
Look, honestly, I don't need the refund.

57:36.542 --> 57:38.955
Just let me exchange it
for something else.

57:39.042 --> 57:41.955
A casual exchange seldom expresses
a lady's self-assurance

57:42.042 --> 57:47.959
- and her embodiment of fashion...
- You know what? Just take the dress.

57:48.042 --> 57:50.705
I don't need anything back,
just take it.

57:52.792 --> 57:56.456
Lamentations can be fairly addressed
to Miss Kolliston.

57:56.958 --> 58:03.114
Distinction avows her noble hearing.
Psst! Psst!

58:03.208 --> 58:04.415
Forget it.

58:15.417 --> 58:20.287
Like a whisper in an ocean,
like a feather in a storm,

58:20.875 --> 58:27.372
a dress of deduction finds its character
in a prism of retail abstraction.

58:28.458 --> 58:30.165
I don't understand.

58:31.375 --> 58:35.119
Miss Luckmoore
experienced a transaction of ecstasy,

58:35.958 --> 58:39.497
and I ask if you could
mutually sanctify her claim?

58:39.583 --> 58:44.999
Look, this is nothing personal,
but I'm done with the sales, thank you.

58:45.083 --> 58:50.203
But your dismissal of such a prestigious
consumerist festivity leaves me bereft.

58:51.208 --> 58:54.701
Did Miss Luckmoore
engage with the doctrine of the store

58:54.792 --> 59:00.459
and did the experience consolidate your
perception of the paradigm of retail?

59:01.042 --> 59:02.533
I've got to go back to work.

59:02.625 --> 59:05.993
Just a goodwill gesture
for the inaugural consumer.

59:06.083 --> 59:10.202
A fantastic offer,
I inferred to myself in jest.

59:11.083 --> 59:14.372
I just don't see
why I couldn't return this dress.

59:14.458 --> 59:19.783
The very purpose of this seasonal retail
occasion is to expunge.

59:20.167 --> 59:21.783
Returning what has already left

59:21.875 --> 59:25.824
the ladies' fashion boutique of Dentley
and Soper's Trusted Department Store

59:25.917 --> 59:29.285
goes against the nature of things.

59:39.708 --> 59:41.791
Such a pretty dress.

59:47.875 --> 59:50.083
I hope Adonis complimented you.

59:58.083 --> 59:59.199
Pitcroft!

01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:09.121
How's your leg, Sheila?

01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:12.036
<i>Better, thank you.</i>

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:13.915
Clive knows the local vet

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.038
and he can confirm that
he destroyed the dog on your behalf.

01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:19.290
<i>He also wanted you to know</i>

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:22.573
that he took great pleasure
in denying the dog its last biscuit.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.787
It must be a pain
not being able to drive.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.458
The doctor reckons
I can start back tomorrow.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:32.786
Oh, good, good.
Um, Sheila, can we have a word?

01:00:34.917 --> 01:00:36.374
Of course.

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:44.869
How was your weekend?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:46.953
Well, interesting.

01:00:47.042 --> 01:00:48.658
<i>Anything nice in the sales?</i>

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.833
Just a dress,
but that was the other week.

01:00:51.833 --> 01:00:53.040
Good bargains.

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:56.417
Sheila, I was pleased to see your name
down on the bowling list again.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.117
Even though I don't think you
should be in Ruth's team, but still,

01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:01.951
we have a nice balance of numbers
this month, so well done.

01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:03.453
Should be an interesting match.

01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:05.659
Yeah. Looking forward to it.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:09.699
Now, Sheila, we caught up
with Pete Mathinson this morning.

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.328
Really meaningful meeting, um...

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.750
just reviewing where we're going
with various things.

01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:17.990
He was very impressed
with how you're getting on, all good.

01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:20.575
Only he mentioned that
you waved at his mistress

01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:23.785
just by Landrake's tuck shop
last weekend.

01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:26.117
Yeah, I remember, she waved back.

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:30.873
Hm. You see, she asked Pete
to call up a meeting about the incident

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.950
and we all came to the conclusion

01:01:33.042 --> 01:01:37.662
that the waving can only be construed
as informal salutation.

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:41.082
I don't understand.

01:01:41.167 --> 01:01:44.581
Technically, the mistress of a boss
is classified as a superior

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.329
according to company policy,

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:50.115
hence her surprise
at such a casual mode of greeting.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:52.871
Yeah, she urged us to term it
as insolent salutation

01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:55.245
but she gets ahead of herself sometimes.

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:57.541
She smiled. She waved back!

01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:01.323
Sheila, when we worked
at the other branch in town

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:05.536
we had a member of staff very similar
to you; diligent, hard working.

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:09.915
Only, Clive and I noticed
a core of the inscrutable about her.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.162
Not remotely
on the Waingel's Wavelength.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.698
We didn't think anything of it until
we discovered she was in the habit

01:02:15.792 --> 01:02:19.536
of injecting foolhardy substances
into her bloodstream on a regular basis.

01:02:19.625 --> 01:02:22.208
<i>Now we're not suggesting
you're inclined that way.</i>

01:02:22.292 --> 01:02:26.741
But nonetheless,
a story shared and all that.

01:02:27.792 --> 01:02:30.455
And those mysterious toilet breaks
before feeding time.

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:33.285
One mysterious toilet break.

01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:36.870
You would tell us
if there was something?

01:02:36.958 --> 01:02:39.746
Then we can keep Pete
and the Police Force out of this.

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:43.998
Well, it's just been busy with my son
and the school holidays.

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:47.833
What's wrong, Sheila? You can tell us.

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:52.787
Nothing! Just a few bad sleeping dreams.

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:55.124
Can you give us an example?

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.245
Well, just this one the other night,
um...

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:06.907
I was very close to my mother,
in real life, I mean.

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:13.117
My father died when I was young
and she and I grew even closer.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.324
I loved her dearly.

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:21.408
I didn't have enough space
to store all her things after she died,

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.208
which always makes me sad.

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:29.412
I gave everything to charity,
but wished I'd kept something.

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:34.657
<i>But in this sleep,
I found one of her old dresses.</i>

01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:40.408
<i>It smelt of her perfume,
which I hadn't come across in years.</i>

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.164
<i>Brought me right back,
made everything feel all right again.</i>

01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:50.037
<i>I put the dress on
and I looked in the mirror,</i>

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.866
<i>but it wasn't me at all.</i>

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:54.996
<i>It was my mother from the grave</i>

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:58.622
with the same jet-black dyed hair.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:02.742
<i>I remember when she bought this dye.</i>

01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:07.123
<i>She was so fed up of the old ones
dripping off in the rain,</i>

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:11.908
<i>but this one was permanent.
More than her flesh.</i>

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.371
I caught a bus and everyone hid
under their seats when they saw me.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.869
Racists.

01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:26.871
I stank of my mother's corpse.

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:30.121
The stench made the driver vomit

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:35.366
and we went off a cliff and I woke up.

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:41.915
And what colour was the bus?

01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:45.451
It was the colour
of Thames Valley-on-Thames.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.876
Yeah, it was that colour.

01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:10.371
I'm dropping some stuff off
at the charity shop

01:05:10.458 --> 01:05:12.871
if you've got anything
that needs taking.

01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:17.291
Is that a yes or a no?

01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:18.707
<i>Maybe!</i>

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:21.495
Well, you go on Monday, then.

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:26.453
And don't forget to bring the stuff
on the back seat. Yes?

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:28.161
<i>Yes!</i>

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:32.824
OK. I'll see you in the morning.
I've left you some food in the fridge.

01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:34.203
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:05:35.042 --> 01:05:37.034
I'm gonna stay with someone.

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:39.415
<i>What? You mean slaphead?</i>

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.412
His name's Zach.

01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:44.165
<i>I thought you said
he was a mate.</i>

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:46.867
Well, he's something more than that now.

01:05:57.167 --> 01:06:01.958
<i>What I always do is,
because I love queueing for the sales,</i>

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:07.162
<i>I find it really exciting,
and I have done it all night, actually.</i>

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.491
<i>Yes, it's great fun.</i>

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:11.451
<i>There's a great camaraderie, you know.</i>

01:06:11.542 --> 01:06:14.250
<i>And everybody's good.
They keep your place</i>

01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:17.747
<i>while you go and get an all-night
coffee or something like that.</i>

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:23.249
<i>But the advice I always give,
when you go in, don't follow the crowd,</i>

01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:27.031
<i>because they all go up
the main central escalator.</i>

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:31.414
<i>But I always dive
to the side of the store</i>

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.870
<i>where I know there's another staircase
and run up there to the first floor</i>

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:40.749
<i>because I know what I want
because I'd been the week before</i>

01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:44.076
<i>and I knew I wanted
this, you know, particular dress.</i>

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.954
<i>And there it was...</i>

01:08:21.542 --> 01:08:27.082
<i>You've reached 01632 960786.</i>

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:31.241
<i>I'm not in right now, but if you leave
a message I'll get straight back to you.</i>

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.662
<i>Pick up the phone,
it's the Police Force.</i>

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:36.537
<i>Pick up the phone this instant.</i>

01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:02.537
<i>If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.</i>

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:03.957
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.912
Oh, that does look nice on you.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.537
Really? I might freeze to death in this.

01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:17.823
Think about your summer cruise
along the Adriatic

01:09:17.917 --> 01:09:19.908
with the breeze running through
that dress

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.618
as you sip your sparkling wine
with the captain on deck.

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:34.871
I can't afford a cruise
this summer.

01:09:35.667 --> 01:09:37.750
Well, if you need any help,
just let me know.

01:09:37.832 --> 01:09:39.198
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:48.745
<i>All right, mate.
Just that, please.</i>

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:13.078
Welcome to Amesos, dear guest.
My name is Sandro. And you are?

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.957
Uh... Reg Speaks.

01:10:15.042 --> 01:10:16.829
<i>May I take your lucky order?</i>

01:10:17.625 --> 01:10:19.833
Just a kebab will be fine. And chips.

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:21.624
Kebab and chips, instantly.

01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:26.874
Uh... Sorry, no bags on the table.
Is not nice. And drinks?

01:10:27.292 --> 01:10:31.957
Reggie!

01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:37.242
Down it! Down it!
Down it! Down it! Down it!

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.290
Oi, oi!

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:40.536
I'm soaked!

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:42.912
Never mind, Reg. Never mind.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.541
As your best man, I come equipped,
excuse me, for every eventuality.

01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:52.949
You need new clothing?
Look no further.

01:10:53.042 --> 01:10:55.034
I always knew you had a feminine side.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.993
What choice has he got with Babs around?

01:10:58.083 --> 01:11:01.497
Well, don't just look at it. I didn't
just buy it for the missus, you know!

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:04.496
- I can't put it on in here.
<i>- "I can't put it on in here."</i>

01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:06.018
- Go on, get it on.
- It won't fit me.

01:11:06.042 --> 01:11:08.125
It'll fit you,
don't worry about that, go on.

01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:10.325
Yeah, come on,
you big girl's blouse, get it on!

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:13.376
Come on, Reg! Don't let the side down!

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:18.324
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.330
- Wait, where's the dummy?
- Oi! Clipper!

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:28.661
<i>Speech! Speech</i>

01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:33.541
<i>Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech! Speech!</i>

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:36.038
Oh, you bloody tosspot.
I'll do it, all right?

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:39.618
Reg here has been hanging
around my house,

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:44.749
or more specifically,
my daughter's bedroom, since he was 17.

01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:47.075
Now we all love Reg, don't we? Don't we?

01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:51.702
I mean, he always gets a round in,
good at five-a-side,

01:12:51.792 --> 01:12:55.786
and I gotta say,
he's always good around Babs.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.787
And that ain't no easy task.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.457
You can say that again.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:03.831
But seriously,
we've got a good 'un here.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.332
He's solid, our Reg.

01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:12.324
But if you ever, ever
mess with my Babs,

01:13:12.417 --> 01:13:15.615
I'll take you straight down,
make no mistake. You got that?

01:13:16.833 --> 01:13:18.495
Steady on, Bananas.

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:22.202
No, no, it has to be said.
Best to get it out of the way now.

01:13:22.292 --> 01:13:25.160
Now come on, son. Give us a hug!

01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:30.700
- No, no, no, come on, that's enough!
- Reg Speaks! I salute you!

01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:33.375
- To Reg and Babs!
<i>- To Reg and Babs!</i>

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:35.791
And here's to your first divorce!

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:37.707
Oi, oi! Less of that, all right?

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:59.039
<i>But he doesn't have to roll
his eyes at every suggestion I make.</i>

01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:02.243
It's always this "I know better"
attitude whenever I deal with Andre.

01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:05.952
At this rate, I'll get Reg to DJ,
assuming he recovers.

01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:08.329
It's a chamber of booze
and methane in here.

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:10.579
I'm surprised
it hasn't killed the canary.

01:15:11.917 --> 01:15:13.249
No idea.

01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:17.289
He'll stuff it down him and it's always
the same. He never puts on any weight.

01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:20.243
No idea how the jammy bastard does it.
It's so unfair.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:25.073
Look, let me know if Andre is willing
to be more flexible with the music

01:15:25.167 --> 01:15:27.705
otherwise we don't pay. Simple as that.

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:30.324
Exactly. See you later.

01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:44.531
Oi! Stop squeezing my spots, yeah?

01:15:44.625 --> 01:15:46.036
Knew that would wake you.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.832
Just ease it on, Babs.

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:49.829
Good night, then?

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:53.209
Wish I had a tape of you banging on
about how you weren't gonna drink.

01:15:53.292 --> 01:15:56.126
It's not the drink,
it's just a dirty kebab.

01:15:56.208 --> 01:15:59.246
Yeah, right. Don't know why
you hang out with that lot.

01:15:59.333 --> 01:16:01.040
You know what they'll get you into.

01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:04.368
We didn't do anything.
It's just a dirty kebab.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:06.791
Dirty kebab my arse, Reg Speaks.

01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:09.333
All you had to do
was not accept the drinks.

01:16:09.417 --> 01:16:11.534
I didn't want to let the side down.

01:16:12.542 --> 01:16:14.374
You gonna lay in bed like that all day?

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:19.160
You know Andre
now wants to do a soundcheck?

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.541
What's a... What's a soundcheck?

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:27.207
He wants to check all the gear.

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:30.581
He says it takes three hours. It's gonna
cut right through the wedding.

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:32.875
It's just playing records, innit?

01:16:32.958 --> 01:16:34.665
Well, you speak to him, then.

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:37.413
I can't deal with
that weasel-mouthed diva any more.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.911
Every time I question something,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.663
he just comes back at me
claiming he's a perfectionist.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.082
Not now, yeah?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.788
- What's that?
- Huh? What?

01:16:57.458 --> 01:17:00.496
Oi! Cottrell wants to take you on.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:02.199
About what?

01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:04.124
You didn't invite him to the stag.

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:07.451
But, I-I didn't think
it was his thing.

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:10.409
You try telling that to Cottrell.

01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:38.120
Gary said you wanted to see me.

01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:05.823
<i>So how long's it gonna take
to get that spare whatever you call it?</i>

01:18:05.917 --> 01:18:09.365
- Probably about ten days.
<i>- Ten days?</i>

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:13.368
Well, could be sooner if I can get
one of my colleagues to drop it over.

01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:16.201
- Too busy to do it yourself?
- I'll be on my honeymoon then.

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:19.456
Honeymoon? Oh. Congratulations.

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:22.501
And what's the destination? Tenerife?

01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:25.576
Uh, Lost John's Cave. Up in Lancs.

01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:29.083
- The wife's got a thing about caves.
<i>- Oh.</i>

01:18:29.167 --> 01:18:32.490
- Already calling her the wife?
- She's called me worse.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.575
And what's the wife's name?

01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:39.827
Her name's Babs. She works
at Ambrook's Razors, dispatch manager.

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:42.955
Ambrook's? Yeah, my sister used to
go out with a bloke from Ambrook's.

01:18:43.042 --> 01:18:44.283
Really nice fella, too.

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:46.833
Oh, that, um...
that must be Phil Keeble.

01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:49.284
Why? No one else nice at Ambrook's?

01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:52.704
What's your fiancée like?

01:18:53.792 --> 01:18:55.283
She's all right, yeah.

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.241
How long have you been together?

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.791
Fourteen, fifteen years.
Something like that.

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:01.616
<i>Why get married now?</i>

01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:06.161
I dunno. It's just always been Babs.

01:19:06.583 --> 01:19:08.324
You've never been out with anyone else?

01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:10.704
<i>- No.</i>
- Never tempted?

01:19:12.042 --> 01:19:13.499
Not really. It's just Babs.

01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:15.996
<i>You're telling me
you never ever get tempted?</i>

01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:19.622
You never even look at another woman
walking down the street?

01:19:21.792 --> 01:19:25.018
I can see there's also a problem with the
way the belt rides over the pump pulley.

01:19:25.042 --> 01:19:26.749
Small-talk time's up, then?

01:19:27.542 --> 01:19:29.750
I've got Mrs Beckley
up the road at five.

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:31.574
Really?

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.245
What's your name, young sir?

01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:38.454
Uh, Reg Speaks.

01:19:39.417 --> 01:19:41.033
Reg Speaks.

01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:46.030
My ex-husband used to say
he never looked at other women.

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:50.074
He's probably selling the same lie
to his new wife as we speak.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:53.789
What I'd give to know what goes on
in the male mind.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.912
Any thoughts?

01:19:58.125 --> 01:20:01.289
It doesn't ride properly
over the transmission drive.

01:20:01.917 --> 01:20:03.533
All that tension on the belt

01:20:03.625 --> 01:20:06.333
is creating havoc with the washers
on the clutch shaft.

01:20:07.667 --> 01:20:09.909
The transmission mounting bolts
have come loose,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.208
which might have been
affecting the washer.

01:20:12.292 --> 01:20:15.911
The clutch assembly seems to have lost
connection with the low-speed solenoid,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.038
but I can check the motor wiring
at the transmission block.

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:23.539
The agitator hub seems to be intact
along with the transmission shaft,

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:27.243
but the plungers are no longer fitting
into the wigwags.

01:20:28.125 --> 01:20:30.162
If you let me have a look
at the wigwag terminals,

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:32.583
I can be more specific
about the problem,

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:34.125
but looking at it now,

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:37.372
I can see the wigwag drive shaft
is no longer working...

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.742
Why did you invite Chris Dale
to the wedding?

01:20:44.833 --> 01:20:45.994
Not now.

01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:48.575
In other words,
yet another pointless guest of yours.

01:20:48.667 --> 01:20:51.375
- He taught me judo.
- Yeah, when you were 17

01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:55.031
and even then you legged it when
Roj Lines wanted your dinner money!

01:20:55.125 --> 01:20:58.618
Half the people on that list never
bothered to invite us to their weddings.

01:20:58.708 --> 01:21:00.495
And you can definitely
drop Greg and Tina.

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:03.417
- Why?
- Because they invited themselves!

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.538
Other thing with them is
that opens the door to Dave and Sarah,

01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:09.948
Justin and Linda, Nick and Charlie,
and Adrian and Russ.

01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:11.078
Invite Greg and Tina

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:13.955
and you automatically
have to invite those jokers as well.

01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:15.328
Nip it in the bud.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.162
- Are you listening?
- Yes!

01:22:12.292 --> 01:22:13.328
<i>Look.</i>

01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:17.411
What do you think?

01:22:18.958 --> 01:22:20.540
It's all right, yeah.

01:22:20.625 --> 01:22:22.833
Wash the stink out
and it could be all right on me.

01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:24.741
You like me in it?

01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:28.452
Yeah. Maybe try it with some tights.

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:29.917
Why?

01:22:30.958 --> 01:22:33.917
I dunno. It's a bit nippy out there.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.743
I've told you a million times,
they make my legs itch.

01:22:36.833 --> 01:22:38.790
You don't need anything else with this.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.491
It's fine by itself, look.

01:22:41.292 --> 01:22:43.158
Where did Clipper get it from?

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.242
Some shop or other, I dunno.

01:22:45.333 --> 01:22:47.120
It's a size 36.

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:49.991
How come you fit into it?

01:22:50.083 --> 01:22:51.244
Yeah.

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:53.329
- You listening?
- I like it, yeah!

01:22:53.417 --> 01:22:57.536
<i>You don't get it, do you?
How comes you fit into a size 36?</i>

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.790
<i>Reg!</i>

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:16.747
<i>- Not the fleece!</i>
- It stinks! Wear the other one.

01:23:21.542 --> 01:23:25.331
<i>Like a whisper
in an ocean, like a feather in a storm,</i>

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:31.163
<i>a dress of deduction finds its character
in a prism of retail abstraction.</i>

01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:34.084
<i>See? It's a 38 and it's tight.</i>

01:23:34.167 --> 01:23:37.080
- Get a size up, then.
<i>- So, you think it's tight?</i>

01:23:38.125 --> 01:23:41.289
No, I thought that's what you just said.

01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:49.119
Bloody useless.

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:15.917
Villainy! Now the horrid repercussions
will abate your rank, madam!

01:24:22.167 --> 01:24:23.248
You!

01:24:27.792 --> 01:24:30.956
<i>Over 45 minutes they had me
on hold and then the line goes dead.</i>

01:24:31.042 --> 01:24:32.624
That's my whole lunch break gone.

01:24:32.708 --> 01:24:34.601
<i>You could've had your sandwiches
while you were on hold.</i>

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:37.163
<i>How am I supposed to eat
if I'm all worked up like that?</i>

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.492
I should've never gone
for that store card.

01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:42.121
All that bloody hassle
just for a stupid free umbrella

01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:44.200
which you ended up losing.

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:46.204
Even when I went in there
to try and cancel it,

01:24:46.292 --> 01:24:48.454
the woman kept me waiting
for 30 minutes.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:50.534
No apology, nothing.

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.286
Reg?

01:24:54.417 --> 01:24:57.990
Reg? Reg, are you listening?

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:00.665
Reg?

01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:06.705
<i>Let me just try this on you.</i>

01:25:06.792 --> 01:25:08.124
See if it fits.

01:25:11.542 --> 01:25:14.580
There, that'll keep you warm and cosy.

01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:19.873
He's very patient, isn't he? Not like
most of the boys we get in here.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.207
What's your name, young sir?

01:25:22.292 --> 01:25:25.911
<i>Reginald! Get a move on
or we're going to miss the badminton.</i>

01:25:28.792 --> 01:25:30.351
<i>You need to ask Clipper
where he got it from.</i>

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.162
Knowing him,
it's some second-hand shop.

01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:33.741
<i>What's that got to do with it?</i>

01:25:33.833 --> 01:25:36.826
<i>Think about it! We both got
the same rash, we both wore the dress.</i>

01:25:36.917 --> 01:25:39.375
You never heard of scabies?

01:25:39.458 --> 01:25:42.496
Reg? Reg!

01:25:43.417 --> 01:25:44.703
What?

01:25:56.042 --> 01:25:59.410
<i>- You think we'll need a new one?</i>
- Hopefully not. Let's see, yeah?

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.868
<i>- What was wrong with it?</i>
- Basket drive went bananas.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.500
The basket drive?

01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:08.202
Yeah, the basket drive.
Just went bananas.

01:26:08.292 --> 01:26:10.454
And the spin tube bearings
are knackered.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:13.416
I tried to check the clutch surface
for any damage

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.868
and found that the rivets were
rubbing up against the clutch pulley.

01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:20.076
There's also the possibility
that the drain hose is kinked,

01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:23.956
but I can put that into writing for you
after a more thorough inspection.

01:26:25.042 --> 01:26:27.409
The clutch plate is no longer a plate

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.039
and the switch striker
is neither switching nor striking.

01:26:31.125 --> 01:26:32.866
If I can get to the wigwag solenoid,

01:26:32.958 --> 01:26:35.792
there is a chance I can find out
why the washer didn't drain.

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:40.744
The blocked pump isn't helping matters
and the agitator leaves me at a loss.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:46.540
I can also see that the wigwag terminals
are not where they're supposed to be,

01:26:46.625 --> 01:26:47.991
which leads me to the conclusion

01:26:48.083 --> 01:26:50.325
that this washing machine
is dysfunctional...

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:55.165
- Oi! Cottrell's looking for you.
- What now?

01:27:55.250 --> 01:28:00.416
One of your neighbours reported you.
Just tell me you didn't do it.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.583
I had to, it was an emergency.

01:28:02.667 --> 01:28:04.579
You know the rules, Reg!

01:28:04.667 --> 01:28:08.115
You fix your own machine,
it still has to go through the books.

01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:12.532
- I bought my own spare parts.
- And? Who paid for your training?

01:28:13.792 --> 01:28:16.830
You've really let the side down,
do you know that?

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:20.206
Now get in there
before Cottrell takes me on as well.

01:30:18.542 --> 01:30:20.909
<i>I've had it with Andre.</i>

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.207
If he vetoes one more song,

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:24.909
I'm gonna stick that turntable
up his miserable backside!

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.037
<i>Where'd you learn
to talk like that?</i>

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:30.084
Oh, it's easy for you to say. You're not
the one having to deal with him.

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:34.366
Every time I say no to something,
he just says, "Why? Why? Why?"

01:30:34.458 --> 01:30:36.791
<i>Maybe I can make
a compilation tape.</i>

01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:39.037
- Save us a bit of money too.
- You're joking, right?

01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:41.492
Your record collection
wouldn't even get a flea jumping.

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:44.075
Ease it on, Babs.
I'm only trying to help.

01:30:47.083 --> 01:30:48.699
<i>What's this doing down here?</i>

01:30:51.042 --> 01:30:52.783
<i>Sorry, I didn't see that there.</i>

01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:59.867
- What are you doing? They stay there.
- Why?

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:05.768
Now come in the kitchen you two.
I've got a cheesecake for you both.

01:31:05.792 --> 01:31:07.283
Oh, lovely. Cheers, darling.

01:31:11.458 --> 01:31:12.574
You're not worried?

01:31:13.542 --> 01:31:15.875
- About what?
- That.

01:31:17.333 --> 01:31:19.700
It's probably just
the washing powder we use.

01:31:19.792 --> 01:31:22.034
- You don't think it's scabies?
- No.

01:31:22.125 --> 01:31:23.866
- An allergy?
- No.

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:28.618
- Something venereal?
- You tell me.

01:31:28.708 --> 01:31:30.916
- I haven't slept around.
- Me neither.

01:31:32.333 --> 01:31:34.575
- Does that mean you love me, then?
- Yeah.

01:32:05.542 --> 01:32:07.408
<i>She's asphyxiated.</i>

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.412
<i>How can a dress asphyxiate it?</i>

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.868
Well, how else did she die?
She's barely a year old.

01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:16.122
- Could be carbon monoxide.
- We'd be dead then.

01:32:16.208 --> 01:32:20.157
- Not if it's a small leak.
- You're scaring me now.

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.913
I'll come back
and take a look on my lunch break.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.788
No way can you get home
and back in an hour.

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:28.208
Go off to work.
I'll look at it during lunch.

01:32:28.875 --> 01:32:31.413
- If the flame turns orange, call me.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:32:33.292 --> 01:32:34.453
What are you doing?

01:32:35.333 --> 01:32:37.040
Uh... You're going to be late.

01:32:38.167 --> 01:32:41.706
Go! Before Cottrell shoves a firework
up your backside.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:47.871
Reg, go! I've got to do my hair.

01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:54.707
<i>Thanks for coming in, Reg.</i>

01:32:54.792 --> 01:32:57.034
When our neighbour heard
you were coming in for a loan,

01:32:57.125 --> 01:32:59.913
- he wanted to pass on his greetings.
- Oh, who was that?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.117
<i>Mr Watlington,
your physics teacher.</i>

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:03.208
Oh, right.

01:33:03.292 --> 01:33:06.285
<i>He also wanted to pass on
his apologies for hitting you so often.</i>

01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:07.375
It's OK.

01:33:07.458 --> 01:33:09.495
It was a bit of
a Reg Speaks evening, in fact.

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:12.906
He kept telling us
about you at school,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.243
and to tell you the truth,
he was sad to hear about your finances

01:33:16.333 --> 01:33:18.245
when we showed him
your loan application.

01:33:18.667 --> 01:33:20.249
Now, with that in mind, of course,

01:33:20.333 --> 01:33:23.326
we'd love to consider
your thoughtful request.

01:33:23.417 --> 01:33:25.659
But given that Staverton's kicked you out,

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:27.867
we're somewhat reluctant to sign it off.

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:29.915
What about here?
I heard there was a job going.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.957
<i>Sorry, that's taken, I'm afraid.</i>

01:33:32.042 --> 01:33:35.018
Though I did see a sign at Dentley and
Soper's saying they were looking for someone

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:37.785
in the male alliance
of clothing and costume.

01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:39.787
No, no, but looking in the sense

01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:41.832
- that one of the staff has disappeared.
- Oh.

01:33:41.917 --> 01:33:44.751
They're just trying to find him.
They're not advertising a job.

01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:47.371
Oh, silly me. It's my mistake.

01:34:09.458 --> 01:34:13.327
Now, the only loan we can offer
is the deferred employment package.

01:34:13.417 --> 01:34:14.498
DEP.

01:34:14.583 --> 01:34:16.575
It's what we like to call
a motivational loan.

01:34:16.667 --> 01:34:18.533
It helps our customers
get back on their feet

01:34:18.625 --> 01:34:20.912
and back into the job market.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.866
With that kind of interest rate?

01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:24.620
That's just advisory.

01:34:25.917 --> 01:34:32.073
Reg, Clive and I had someone over
from Staverton's a few years back

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:33.829
and we still think a lot about

01:34:33.917 --> 01:34:37.115
how nicely he talked us through
the whole process of fixing our machine.

01:34:37.208 --> 01:34:40.827
And we thought seeing as we'll be having
Reg Speaks in the room,

01:34:40.917 --> 01:34:43.204
maybe he could do
something similar for us?

01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:46.199
It would mean a lot to us, Reg.

01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:48.415
But there's no machine here.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.787
You could pretend there's one.

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:52.707
<i>Nobody needs to know.</i>

01:34:52.792 --> 01:34:54.203
But I can't just...

01:34:54.292 --> 01:34:58.241
Just try. Then we can look
at more favourable rates for you.

01:34:59.625 --> 01:35:00.661
It'll be fun.

01:35:04.625 --> 01:35:05.786
Um...

01:35:09.542 --> 01:35:12.580
Plungers on old machines
tend to stop retracting,

01:35:12.667 --> 01:35:15.125
which means a knock-on effect
with the washer.

01:35:17.792 --> 01:35:20.705
A-Also the belt drive had come off.

01:35:24.042 --> 01:35:30.323
The inlet valve might have been blocked,
but I can't verify that.

01:35:30.417 --> 01:35:32.158
It s-seems...

01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:35.618
It's OK. It's OK, Reg.
No one's forcing you.

01:35:37.792 --> 01:35:40.626
If it helps. we could kick it off
in a role-play scenario.

01:35:40.917 --> 01:35:43.830
Yeah. A lot of loan applicants
find our Tudor courtroom scenario

01:35:43.917 --> 01:35:45.203
puts them at ease.

01:35:45.292 --> 01:35:47.158
<i>Clothes still needed
washing then.</i>

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:48.582
That's right.

01:35:52.542 --> 01:35:53.874
What's the matter, Reg?

01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:56.826
You spoke so clearly and nicely
when you first came in.

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:59.034
Oh, no, um, nothing.

01:35:59.125 --> 01:36:02.118
I-I'm just a bit tender
these days, that's all.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.116
How come?

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:11.825
Just a sleeping dream I had last night.
It's been on my mind all day.

01:36:12.917 --> 01:36:14.283
<i>Interesting.</i>

01:36:14.375 --> 01:36:18.790
We're here for you Reg. Sometimes
it can help to discuss these things.

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:26.867
Well, Babs, my fiancée, was in labour.

01:36:26.958 --> 01:36:29.917
<i>I was late, so at that point,
the door was locked.</i>

01:36:32.542 --> 01:36:35.410
<i>I tried to take on her pain
just to make her feel better.</i>

01:36:47.083 --> 01:36:49.370
<i>I kept screaming
to show how much I cared,</i>

01:36:49.458 --> 01:36:52.121
<i>but it just seemed
to annoy everyone.</i>

01:36:53.792 --> 01:36:56.910
<i>I kept knocking on the window
in the hope that they'd let me in.</i>

01:37:05.458 --> 01:37:09.407
<i>The baby came out of Babs in this dress
that looked exactly the same</i>

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.708
<i>as the one I wore
on my stag night at ZinZan's.</i>

01:37:12.875 --> 01:37:16.414
<i>I wanted to wave at my little girl,
but she wasn't having it.</i>

01:37:18.125 --> 01:37:20.959
<i>She made it clear
that I should sling my hook.</i>

01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:30.333
<i>- What was her name?</i>
- Babs Junior.

01:37:31.958 --> 01:37:32.958
Interesting.

01:37:33.042 --> 01:37:36.956
Reminds me of a dream Stash and I had
when we put the sand dunes in the wash.

01:37:37.042 --> 01:37:41.457
Oh, yeah, that. Kept bypassing
the spin cycle, I remember now.

01:37:42.083 --> 01:37:43.244
Was it an old machine?

01:37:43.333 --> 01:37:45.791
No, no, it was brand new.
Wasn't it, Stash?

01:37:45.875 --> 01:37:47.616
Yeah, very strange.

01:37:47.708 --> 01:37:50.826
Did you check the belt
if it was broken or loose?

01:37:50.917 --> 01:37:52.783
That could have been
the problem with it.

01:37:52.875 --> 01:37:56.915
<i>That's what we were wondering,
but maybe it was something else.</i>

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.241
What do you think, Reg?

01:37:59.375 --> 01:38:02.664
It's probably a problem with the wigwag
and its rotational pull.

01:38:03.375 --> 01:38:06.493
Plungers on doors
sometimes don't align with the seal,

01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:08.745
but the lid switch is often to blame.

01:38:09.542 --> 01:38:12.501
The inner tub
might've sustained serious dents

01:38:12.583 --> 01:38:15.451
resulting in the belt drive
loosening or coming off,

01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:18.830
but that's usually a problem
with older machines.

01:38:19.667 --> 01:38:23.490
The lid switch and its actuator,
the motor coupler or door lock assembly

01:38:23.583 --> 01:38:27.532
are the first things to check when
a new machine bypasses the spin cycle.

01:38:28.833 --> 01:38:32.201
The agitator drive shaft and spin tube
linked to the transmission

01:38:32.292 --> 01:38:34.659
can come loose from the tub struts.

01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:37.541
If the helix doesn't release the brake

01:38:37.625 --> 01:38:40.493
and the belt tensioner
doesn't allow slippage...

01:40:03.167 --> 01:40:04.203
Imagine,

01:40:04.292 --> 01:40:08.366
trading will cease at a premature hour
on this, the twelfth day of sales.

01:40:08.917 --> 01:40:11.125
There lie other boutiques
to your discernment.

01:40:11.208 --> 01:40:12.415
But I'm in the store now.

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.868
You can't just turf me out.
Customer rules and all that.

01:40:15.958 --> 01:40:18.575
You must conclude your perusal
immediately, then.

01:40:18.667 --> 01:40:21.785
Excuse me? I've worked in retail.

01:40:21.875 --> 01:40:23.741
Once the customer
steps through the door,

01:40:23.833 --> 01:40:27.247
you see it through to the last.
That's what I had to do.

01:40:27.333 --> 01:40:30.826
The doors you passed through
are doors in perpetual revolve

01:40:30.917 --> 01:40:33.159
and thus not a veritable indication

01:40:33.250 --> 01:40:35.788
of the time in which you thought
you might have set heel

01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:39.789
in Dentley and Soper's
Trusted Department Store, mate.

01:40:39.875 --> 01:40:41.332
You call those doors revolving?

01:40:41.417 --> 01:40:42.453
Hm-hmm.

01:40:42.542 --> 01:40:44.955
Listen, I'm here
to choose a dress, yeah?

01:40:45.042 --> 01:40:48.911
Pick something up, try it on,
pay for it, and then leave you in peace.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.198
By the time you've thought of another
excuse to get me out, I'll be done,

01:40:52.292 --> 01:40:53.408
mate!

01:40:55.167 --> 01:40:59.867
This dress. So shabby, so unkempt.

01:40:59.958 --> 01:41:04.623
We have rules here about presentation,
about hygiene, about conduct.

01:41:05.375 --> 01:41:07.367
A required pedigree of shopping

01:41:07.458 --> 01:41:10.906
is an aspiration
we flowerfully seal to our hearts.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.040
Please, return in a different dress
and we will welcome you back.

01:41:15.917 --> 01:41:18.955
If you let me buy a new dress, I will.

01:41:19.042 --> 01:41:20.158
<i>Psst!</i>

01:41:43.208 --> 01:41:48.374
I now announce you extension time.
Congratulations.

01:41:49.292 --> 01:41:51.204
I never thought I'd say this,

01:41:51.292 --> 01:41:53.500
but you lot could all do with
a good shag.

01:43:11.625 --> 01:43:15.494
Such an intimate document
of finesse and joy.

01:43:15.583 --> 01:43:18.451
Nice to see a catalogue
with ladies bigger than me for once.

01:43:19.208 --> 01:43:21.951
Pray tell, your measurements would be?

01:43:23.792 --> 01:43:26.409
- Guess.
- Thirty-six.

01:43:27.667 --> 01:43:30.159
- Really?
- Thirty-six.

01:43:31.333 --> 01:43:32.619
You're not just saying that?

01:43:32.958 --> 01:43:34.119
Thirty-six.

01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:39.617
Thirty-six. I had a sleeping dream
I was a size thirty-six.

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:43.117
And I went out with my friends
to ZinZan's to celebrate,

01:43:43.208 --> 01:43:45.370
but it wasn't ZinZan's.

01:43:46.083 --> 01:43:47.415
It was here.

01:43:48.875 --> 01:43:50.366
That was where it was.

01:43:51.583 --> 01:43:55.156
It was in this room
and in this catalogue.

01:43:55.958 --> 01:43:59.372
Every image was of me in this slip
getting skinnier and skinnier,

01:43:59.458 --> 01:44:01.415
but the measurements written next to me

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.036
were getting bigger and bigger.

01:44:03.542 --> 01:44:05.625
I rang the staff bell for assistance.

01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.958
Two ladies came to my aid and told me

01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:10.499
to put my head between my knees

01:44:10.583 --> 01:44:12.620
whilst they tried
to correct the catalogue.

01:44:14.333 --> 01:44:17.371
<i>36, 38.</i>

01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:22.241
36, 38.

01:44:23.667 --> 01:44:25.203
36, 38.

01:44:26.625 --> 01:44:28.537
36, 38.

01:44:42.875 --> 01:44:45.117
36, 38.

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:51.120
36, 38.

01:45:26.917 --> 01:45:28.408
<i>And then they buried me.</i>

01:45:29.292 --> 01:45:31.909
<i>Here in this Trusted Department Store.</i>

01:45:33.625 --> 01:45:35.036
And then they buried me.

01:45:39.625 --> 01:45:41.617
Your changing room is waiting for you

01:45:41.708 --> 01:45:46.282
and your dress to coalesce
into a simple union of wonder.

01:46:31.292 --> 01:46:34.000
<i>Attention, consumers.
Attention, consumers.</i>

01:46:34.083 --> 01:46:36.040
<i>Your shopping will conclude now.</i>

01:46:36.125 --> 01:46:39.243
<i>Pay us for your items
and return to your houses.</i>

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.707
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

01:47:03.792 --> 01:47:08.116
- Goodbye to you too, dear Audrey.
- Fantastic.

01:47:15.083 --> 01:47:18.451
There will be this asphodel blouse
and a pair of those funeral stockings.

01:47:18.875 --> 01:47:20.161
Instantly!

01:47:21.125 --> 01:47:24.289
Excuse me, I was here first.

01:47:24.375 --> 01:47:26.037
No, you weren't.

01:47:26.125 --> 01:47:29.414
Going through that tray doesn't give you
the right to bypass the queue.

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.366
You came here after me.

01:47:31.458 --> 01:47:34.041
No, I didn't. Now if you don't mind...

01:47:34.125 --> 01:47:36.583
Such fascination of marvel.

01:47:36.667 --> 01:47:40.331
Its touch to the skin,
its contour on the body.

01:47:40.417 --> 01:47:43.125
I will be served first.
There'll be this cinnamon bra.

01:47:43.208 --> 01:47:45.120
Thank you very much.

01:47:49.667 --> 01:47:50.999
Ladies!

01:47:52.333 --> 01:47:53.699
Hey!

01:49:53.292 --> 01:49:56.490
Blame! Blame!

01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:08.870
<i>Blame! Blame!</i>

01:50:17.292 --> 01:50:18.874
<i>A dramatic affliction</i>

01:50:18.958 --> 01:50:21.746
