- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.643 --> 00:13.203
no cash, no credit, nojob history..

00:13.279 --> 00:16.407

- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.395

ifan operative hands you
a crossword puzzle...

00:54.187 --> 00:58.749
chances are you've just
received a coded message.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.259
It's the art ofsteganography--

01:01.327 --> 01:05.764
sending coded messages that don 't look
like messages unless you have the key.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.964

- Keep the engine running. Ifyou see her leave--
- Tail her. I know.

We can't take more proactive measures?
There's room in the trunk.

01:32.792 --> 01:36.091
The idea is to find out who she's working for
without her knowing, Fi.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.960
It calls for something a little more subtle
than throwing her in the trunk.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.557
- You ready, Sam?
- All set.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.933

Whenyou're following
someone else's instructions...

02:13.933 --> 02:16.925
- they set the agenda, they control the security--

Work has been so busy
that I just don't get the time to shop.

02:50.036 --> 02:53.267
Well, we can't have that. Give me
your boss's number. I'll give him a call.

That's notyour concern.
Whatyou need to know...

is there's one counterfeiter
in Miami who can forge it--

A Tunisian-- name is Nefzi.

- You gonna introduce us?
- No, you're gonna make
the approach on your own.

That's the waywe do things, and that's why
we like working with people likeyou.

03:27.874 --> 03:32.573
We'd like the duplicate
and the original back in two days.

03:32.645 --> 03:37.776
Then... what? We're done with the burn notice?
I get my life back?

03:39.185 --> 03:42.348
It's not that simple, Michael.
Not by a long shot.

03:42.422 --> 03:45.482
But playing nice has its rewards.

- I don't know.

but he launders money for half of Miami.

- He could probably putyou in touch.
- Yeah.

it's never fun hanging out
with a dead body.

39:22.319 --> 39:27.382
But the advantage is there's no one around
to object to a little intelligence gathering.

39:32.629 --> 39:35.291
- [ Door Closes ]
- [ Dog Barking ]

39:35.365 --> 39:38.300
- Mom.
- H i, honey.

39:38.368 --> 39:40.700
Want some coffee?
I made a pot.

39:40.771 --> 39:43.763
No. U h, we gotta go.
Don't we have the session?

39:43.840 --> 39:47.241
I decided to find
another counselor--

39:47.311 --> 39:49.506
one who asks better questions.

39:55.218 --> 39:59.245
Mom, what I did while I was away
I don't like to talk about...

39:59.323 --> 40:02.815
but ifyou want to spend time together,
we can do that.

40:04.661 --> 40:07.323
- We can take a pottery class together.
- [ Chuckles ]

40:08.532 --> 40:10.693
No, thanks.
That's all I need...

40:10.767 --> 40:12.758
is another ugly ceramic ashtray.

40:22.946 --> 40:26.109
I rememberwhen you came home
with the groceries.

40:26.183 --> 40:28.242
Yousaidyou bought them.

40:29.620 --> 40:32.589
And you looked so proud...

40:33.690 --> 40:35.681
that it broke my heart.

40:38.362 --> 40:40.887
I thought that you didn't
want me to know, Michael.

40:44.534 --> 40:46.525
Hmm.

40:47.971 --> 40:50.098
I always hated that bag boy.

40:50.173 --> 40:52.403
It's nice to know
I was right about him.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.983
He was awfully good,
don'tyou think?

41:06.056 --> 41:08.923
- Areyou gonna kill everyone I talk to?
- Better them than you, Michael.

41:08.992 --> 41:11.586
No more nitrogen gas,
no more high-powered rifles.

41:11.662 --> 41:13.857
All right, fine.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.422
Oh, look.
You forgotyour money.

41:17.501 --> 41:20.493
No, I'm never gonna work foryou, Carla--
not that way.

41:20.570 --> 41:24.529
That's okay, Michael.
I'll hold onto it foryou.

41:39.523 --> 41:43.425
- Hey, Mike. What's up?
- Yeah, Sam, I think I got something.

41:43.493 --> 41:46.553
Carla speaks Arabic
with a Kurdish accent.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.598
Huh. Doyou think
she was stationed there?

41:48.665 --> 41:50.656
I was hoping you could ask around?

41:50.734 --> 41:53.567
Will do, buddy. But I gotta tell you,
it's not much to go on.

41:53.637 --> 41:56.800
I know, Sam,
but it's more than we had.

41:56.873 --> 41:58.465
