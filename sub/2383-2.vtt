WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:03.200
So, this chick and
I are going at it

00:03.204 --> 00:04.787
behind the Central Park Zoo.

00:04.788 --> 00:07.924
The Bonobo chimps start
giving us a standing O,

00:07.925 --> 00:10.293
and just when I'm about to
give her the same thing...

00:10.294 --> 00:13.196
What up?... I...

00:13.197 --> 00:15.364
I can't.

00:15.365 --> 00:16.966
I just... I can't.

00:16.967 --> 00:20.420
Guys, I know you count the
minutes until you can escape

00:20.421 --> 00:23.306
from your humdrum lives by
hearing how awesome mine is,

00:23.307 --> 00:27.727
and I love doing that for you,
but I just can't tonight.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.763
- What's wrong?
- I don't want to talk about it.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.166
Okay. Hey, you guys see
Deadliest Catch last night?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.167
Did I ever!

00:34.168 --> 00:35.318
Deadliest Catch ever!

00:35.319 --> 00:36.769
All right, I'll tell you!

00:36.770 --> 00:40.673
My mother is selling
the house I grew up in.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.810
All of my childhood memories
gone, just like that!

00:43.811 --> 00:45.028
That sucks.

00:45.029 --> 00:46.446
I've been there, buddy.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.898
What are you talking about?

00:47.899 --> 00:49.549
Your mother still lives in
the house you grew up in.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.401
With her new hippie
husband, Clint.

00:51.402 --> 00:53.236
The comfort of home is
a little ruined

00:53.237 --> 00:54.905
when someone turns
your old room

00:54.906 --> 00:57.991
into what I'm pretty sure is
a Tantric sex temple.

00:57.992 --> 01:00.043
With all the bamboo,
pot smoke and '60s music,

01:00.044 --> 01:02.278
it's like my old G.I. Joes
are frozen in

01:02.279 --> 01:03.947
some weird
Vietnam flashback.

01:03.948 --> 01:06.783
Anyway, I need you guys
to come out

01:06.784 --> 01:10.119
to Staten Island on Saturday
and help box everything up.

01:11.389 --> 01:14.290
You expect us
to spend a whole day

01:14.291 --> 01:15.542
packing up your
mom's house?

01:15.543 --> 01:16.760
Of course not.

01:16.761 --> 01:18.395
It's a two-day job.

01:18.396 --> 01:19.429
Pass.

01:19.430 --> 01:20.513
Same.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.482
Unsubscribe.

01:24.769 --> 01:26.469
You guys are adorable.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.371
You seriously believe
that I, Barney Stinson,

01:28.372 --> 01:29.956
can't talk you into this?

01:29.957 --> 01:32.158
I got the Queen
to give me a fist bump.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.660
No one believes
that story.

01:34.612 --> 01:36.579
You may be able to talk
the brain surgeons

01:36.580 --> 01:38.147
you pick up into doing
whatever you want,

01:38.148 --> 01:40.250
but it's not gonna work on us.

01:47.792 --> 01:50.660
How did he do that?

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

02:04.124 --> 02:07.660
<i>So there we were helping
Barney pack up his childhood home.</i>

02:07.661 --> 02:09.044
Whoa, Ted, that thing
you're packing is

02:09.045 --> 02:10.779
way too big to fit
in that box.

02:10.780 --> 02:11.881
Yeah, that's what your mom said.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.799
How dare you!

02:13.800 --> 02:15.818
No, she actually said that.

02:15.819 --> 02:17.403
Oh, dear, I thought I told you,

02:17.404 --> 02:19.155
that's just not going
to fit in there.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.458
Someone order something tall,
dark and awesome?

02:22.459 --> 02:24.377
- James!
- Bro!

02:24.378 --> 02:26.296
- How you doing?
- Hey!

02:27.331 --> 02:28.598
- Oh, my goodness!
- Mama.

02:28.599 --> 02:30.499
Look at my two sons.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.352
So big and strong
and handsome.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.636
Mom.

02:33.637 --> 02:35.305
Stop.

02:35.306 --> 02:36.773
And how is my delicious
little grandson?

02:36.774 --> 02:38.007
Oh, did he get
the clothes I sent him?

02:38.008 --> 02:40.143
Check it. Huh?

02:41.645 --> 02:43.313
How cute is
that, right?

02:43.314 --> 02:45.698
When was the last time
you saw a diaper poking out

02:45.699 --> 02:47.533
of a Dolce and Gabana suit?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.585
Tuesday at work.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.854
Some of the senior partners
are really getting up there.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.874
So, Ted,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.542
yesterday at work,
I totally talked you up

02:56.543 --> 02:58.378
to that super-hot
makeup girl, Liz.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.213
Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?

03:00.214 --> 03:02.081
Oh, you know,
how funny you are...

03:02.082 --> 03:03.416
Guilty.
Handsome.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.834
Who, me?

03:04.835 --> 03:06.002
Incredible lover.

03:06.003 --> 03:07.303
Really?
Oh, yeah.

03:07.304 --> 03:09.205
Oh, yeah. I was all like,

03:09.206 --> 03:12.141
"He knows a woman's body better
than she knows her own,

03:12.142 --> 03:15.678
"endless waves of pleasure
just cresting and breaking

03:15.679 --> 03:17.713
for hours and hours..."
Blah, blah, blah.

03:17.714 --> 03:20.900
"Orgasms so intense
that you just black out."

03:20.901 --> 03:22.402
All that stuff.

03:22.403 --> 03:26.322
Robin, how can I possibly live
up to that review?

03:26.323 --> 03:28.107
What? You know what
you're doing down there.

03:28.108 --> 03:31.244
Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it.
We know this.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.162
But that is not the point.

03:33.163 --> 03:34.614
I mean, you broke
the first rule

03:34.615 --> 03:36.949
of setting people up:
undersell.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.252
<i>It's like, if someone's
never seen The Karate Kid,</i>

03:39.253 --> 03:41.404
you don't say,
"It's the greatest movie ever."

03:41.405 --> 03:42.955
You say, "Uh, it's pretty good""

03:42.956 --> 03:45.208
And then they see it,
it blows their freakin' mind.

03:45.209 --> 03:48.294
Because Cobra Kai sensei's
all like, "Sweep the leg!"

03:48.295 --> 03:49.679
And Daniel-san's all like...

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:59.556 --> 04:01.757
Maybe I did oversell you a bit.

04:01.758 --> 04:04.777
Thank you guys so much for
helping us out with this stuff.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.978
Oh, it gives us

04:05.979 --> 04:08.597
a rare insight into the
makings of Barney Stinson.

04:09.616 --> 04:10.766
Like, look at this.

04:10.767 --> 04:13.486
Who was a cute
little basketball player

04:13.487 --> 04:16.605
before he became the biggest
pervert in the world?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.375
I loved Pee Wee basketball.

04:19.375 --> 04:22.077
Well, until they
kicked me off the team...

04:22.079 --> 04:23.796
<i>I was so awesome,</i>

04:23.797 --> 04:25.047
<i>the coach asked me to quit</i>

04:25.048 --> 04:27.800
<i>because it wasn't fair
to the other kids.</i>

04:31.955 --> 04:33.956
That sounds plausible.

04:33.957 --> 04:35.258
Hey. It's true.

04:35.259 --> 04:36.976
Tell him, James.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.479
Oh, yeah, he had, like, a
four-foot vertical leap.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.813
He would hit it
from the outside,

04:40.814 --> 04:42.231
hit it from
the inside...

04:42.232 --> 04:43.266
He sucked.

04:43.267 --> 04:44.600
Coach cut him from the team,

04:44.601 --> 04:46.569
and Mom fed him that story
so he'd feel better.

04:46.570 --> 04:48.821
Oh, my God!
Look at this.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.807
My letter from
the Postmaster General.

04:51.808 --> 04:53.426
I still can't believe
he took the time

04:53.427 --> 04:54.527
to write this...

04:54.528 --> 04:57.046
"Dear Barney..."

04:57.047 --> 05:00.583
I sincerely apologize
about losing all the invitations

05:00.584 --> 05:03.419
you sent out to your
eighth birthday party.

05:03.420 --> 05:06.506
That's why none of your
classmates showed up.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.158
Not because you threw up

05:09.159 --> 05:11.994
when they turned the lights off
at the Planetarium.

05:11.995 --> 05:14.147
No one even noticed that.

05:14.148 --> 05:19.001
Also, Janey Masterson's
mother is a whore,

05:19.002 --> 05:22.321
and with gin on her breath
at 10:00 in the morning,

05:22.322 --> 05:26.125
she's got some nerve kicking us
out of the carpool.

05:26.126 --> 05:31.981
Love,
Postmaster General.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.368
Thank you.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.904
Does your mom make stuff
like that up a lot?

05:37.905 --> 05:40.740
Constantly. I mean,
she put more effort

05:40.741 --> 05:42.375
into some lies than others.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.410
Mom? Who's my dad?

05:44.411 --> 05:47.079
All the other kids at school
know who their dad is.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.798
Who's mine?

05:48.799 --> 05:51.767
Oh, I don't know...

05:51.768 --> 05:54.036
That guy.

05:55.138 --> 05:57.673
Did she tell you that Bob
Barker was your dad, too?

05:57.674 --> 06:00.142
No. No, no.
I heard Flip Wilson,

06:00.143 --> 06:03.379
Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones,

06:03.380 --> 06:04.981
Meadowlark Lemon...

06:04.982 --> 06:06.933
The list goes on.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.936
I still can't get a straight
answer about who my real dad is.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.320
And Barney's no help.

06:11.321 --> 06:14.774
He still believes every lie
that my mom told us growing up.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.776
Not me.
I caught on early.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.327
Careful!

06:18.328 --> 06:20.530
Michael Jackson sent me
this glove for my tenth...

06:20.531 --> 06:22.999
Damn.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.904
Loretta really lied
a lot to her kids.

06:28.905 --> 06:30.006
Well, she's not alone.

06:30.007 --> 06:31.958
Whenever Marshall
was acting too hyper,

06:31.959 --> 06:34.293
his mom would suddenly decide
he was "sick"

06:34.294 --> 06:37.246
and give him cough medicine
until he passed out.

06:37.247 --> 06:38.681
I'm pretty sure

06:38.682 --> 06:40.082
that's what
stunted my growth.

06:40.083 --> 06:43.185
I hit 6'4" in the fifth grade,
and then I just stopped.

06:43.186 --> 06:45.471
And then there's
the most popular

06:45.472 --> 06:47.440
parental lie in history.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.724
Santa.

06:48.725 --> 06:50.443
Yeah, but that's
a good lie.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.112
Like when we tell Ted he'll meet
the right girl and settle down.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.763
I always find
that reassuring.

06:54.764 --> 06:56.032
You will meet
her, buddy.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.284
You think so?
Yeah!

06:59.453 --> 07:02.955
Santa's still a lie, and
I'm not lying to our kids.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.657
Baby, it's Santa.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.325
Don't you want our
kids going to sleep

07:06.326 --> 07:09.328
on Christmas Eve with their
hearts full of hope,

07:09.329 --> 07:11.831
their heads full of crazy
cough syrup nightmares,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.115
knowing that downstairs

07:13.116 --> 07:15.885
Kris Kringle is stuffing their
stockings full of joy

07:15.886 --> 07:18.220
and stuffing his
belly full of milk

07:18.221 --> 07:19.639
and lutefisk that they left him?

07:19.640 --> 07:20.840
Milk and lutefisk?

07:20.841 --> 07:23.009
Santa doesn't get cookies
in Minnesota?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.895
Yeah, that's just what Santa
needs at 3:00 a.m.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.680
when he's battling a snowstorm
over the Rockies:

07:27.681 --> 07:30.933
a sugar crash. No.
Santa needs protein.

07:30.934 --> 07:31.984
I'm not lying to our kids.

07:33.803 --> 07:34.854
Valentines.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.739
The second base
of third grade.

07:36.740 --> 07:40.409
I always got a Valentine from
every single girl in my class.

07:40.410 --> 07:44.146
Funny how all these girls have
the exact same handwriting

07:44.147 --> 07:47.750
as the Postmaster
General, Mom, and...

07:47.751 --> 07:51.170
home run king,
Frank Aaron.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.339
Yeah, school girls...

07:53.340 --> 07:55.991
The more they ignore you,
pretend to hate your guts,

07:55.992 --> 07:58.094
lock you in the coatroom
over winter break,

07:58.095 --> 08:00.513
the more they
secretly like you.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.799
This isn't...

08:03.800 --> 08:05.051
Who's Sam Gibbs?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.519
No idea. Why?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.938
Mom addressed this
and never sent it.

08:08.939 --> 08:10.640
What's in it?

08:16.396 --> 08:18.981
It's a picture of you and me
when we were little kids.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.851
On the back, Mom wrote...

08:22.852 --> 08:24.704
"Your son."

08:29.537 --> 08:31.304
Okay, everyone,
lunch is ready.

08:31.305 --> 08:32.922
Who wants Sloppy Joes?

08:32.923 --> 08:35.291
Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?

08:36.458 --> 08:37.960
That doesn't sound familiar.

08:37.961 --> 08:39.895
Who wants Sloppy Joes?

08:39.897 --> 08:41.147
There's a picture
of me and Barney

08:41.148 --> 08:42.347
in an envelope
addressed to him.

08:42.349 --> 08:44.350
And you wrote "your
son" on the back.

08:44.351 --> 08:45.852
Oh, no, that...

08:45.853 --> 08:47.854
It says "Yourson."

08:47.855 --> 08:49.522
For Yourson,
North Dakota.

08:49.523 --> 08:51.858
That's where we took the
picture. Lovely town.

08:51.859 --> 08:54.694
We went kayaking, and you two
rescued the mayor's dog

08:54.695 --> 08:56.279
which had wandered
into the rapids.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.531
That mayor, Sam Gibbs,

08:58.532 --> 08:59.949
asked for your
picture so the city

08:59.950 --> 09:01.501
could make statues
of you both.

09:01.502 --> 09:03.920
I guess I never sent it.
That's embarrassing.

09:03.921 --> 09:07.340
Now, how about
those Sloppy Joes?

09:07.341 --> 09:09.225
If this picture was
taken in North Dakota,

09:09.226 --> 09:11.644
then why is our old swing
set in the background?

09:11.645 --> 09:13.629
I don't know!

09:13.630 --> 09:15.965
I did my best
as a single parent,

09:15.966 --> 09:17.016
and it wasn't always easy,

09:17.017 --> 09:19.168
and I'd recommend
putting the coleslaw

09:19.169 --> 09:22.772
right on top of the Sloppy Joe,
because it's delicious that way!

09:25.392 --> 09:27.393
Can you believe her?

09:27.394 --> 09:29.395
I know.

09:29.396 --> 09:31.397
Forgetting to
send the photo.

09:31.398 --> 09:33.349
That poor sculptor had
to work from memory.

09:33.350 --> 09:34.984
Those statues probably
look nothing like us.

09:34.985 --> 09:36.552
Damn it, Mom!

09:38.038 --> 09:39.121
So, Ted?

09:39.122 --> 09:40.289
You were worried

09:40.290 --> 09:43.025
that I oversold you
to Liz. Well, I fixed it.

09:43.026 --> 09:45.294
How?
I sent her another email.

09:45.295 --> 09:47.496
"Dear Liz. I hope
it didn't sound

09:47.497 --> 09:49.048
"like I was trying
to oversell Ted.

09:49.049 --> 09:52.335
"The truth is, he is a genuinely
nice, down to earth guy,

09:52.336 --> 09:54.804
and I think you two
would really hit it off."

09:54.805 --> 09:56.172
Thank you. Thank you.
That's perfect.

09:56.173 --> 09:57.706
That totally takes
the pressure...

09:57.707 --> 10:00.009
"Is he going to rock
your world in bed? No.

10:00.010 --> 10:01.394
"But he's clean,

10:01.395 --> 10:05.147
"open to criticism, and not
into anything too weird.

10:05.148 --> 10:07.099
"He's not bad at all.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.768
Not bad at all."

10:08.769 --> 10:10.353
See, now you went too
far in the other...

10:10.354 --> 10:11.887
"I'll be honest.
The first few times

10:11.888 --> 10:13.155
"aren't going
to be that great.

10:13.156 --> 10:14.857
"He's going to say
'Are you finished?'

10:14.858 --> 10:16.526
more times than a waiter
in a busy restaurant."

10:16.527 --> 10:17.894
Stop!

10:17.895 --> 10:20.313
Listen to me. There is no
Yourson, North Dakota.

10:20.314 --> 10:23.099
Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.101
He might be one
of our fathers.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.287
Well, he's not my dad.
My dad's Bob Barker.

10:27.288 --> 10:29.706
Barney! You...
You've got to stop living

10:29.707 --> 10:31.524
in these fairy tales
that Mom told us!

10:31.525 --> 10:34.243
Bob Barker is not your father.

10:34.244 --> 10:35.828
Sam Gibbs might be,

10:35.829 --> 10:40.700
but Bob Barker is absolutely,
unequivocally not your father.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.221
I suppose you have a problem
with the Easter Bunny, too.

10:45.222 --> 10:46.639
Not now.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.208
This address
isn't too far.

10:49.209 --> 10:51.060
Are you coming
with me, or not?

10:52.479 --> 10:54.097
<i>So we're doing this?</i>

10:54.098 --> 10:55.131
We're really going
to go disturb

10:55.132 --> 10:57.400
the peaceful
Long Island retirement

10:57.401 --> 11:00.302
of the former mayor
of Yourson, North Dakota

11:00.303 --> 11:01.304
on a Sunday afternoon?

11:01.305 --> 11:03.022
Real classy, James.
Real classy.

11:03.023 --> 11:04.941
You're just too scared
to face the truth.

11:04.942 --> 11:08.077
You're living in
a dream world.

11:11.365 --> 11:14.167
Maybe we shouldn't have
brought these Sloppy Joes.

11:14.168 --> 11:17.319
Oh, what's done
is done.

11:18.505 --> 11:21.257
"Ted Mosby is
solid as a rock."

11:21.258 --> 11:23.092
No. "Dependable."

11:23.093 --> 11:24.510
No.

11:24.511 --> 11:26.179
"Rugged." No.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.164
Why don't I just go
to the Chevy Web site

11:28.165 --> 11:29.999
and copy down adjectives?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.285
I just want to hit that
perfect middle ground.

11:32.286 --> 11:35.271
How about we just go
wildly to both extremes

11:35.272 --> 11:37.907
and just let them balance
each other out?

11:37.908 --> 11:41.093
"Ted Mosby is really handsome,
but extremely violent,

11:41.094 --> 11:42.194
"and really rich,

11:42.195 --> 11:44.830
but lacks bladder control."

11:46.667 --> 11:48.417
Oh, damn.
What?

11:48.418 --> 11:49.818
That last bump
just made me hit send.

11:49.819 --> 11:51.537
Oh, no.
Don't worry.

11:51.538 --> 11:53.756
I'm sure that everyone
will get it's a joke.

11:53.757 --> 11:55.675
No, they won't.
They're going to think...

11:55.676 --> 11:57.176
Wait. "Everyone"?

11:59.212 --> 12:01.681
"Really rich"?

12:05.686 --> 12:07.520
You ready for this?

12:07.521 --> 12:08.938
For what?

12:08.939 --> 12:11.774
I don't know who lives here,
but it's not my dad.

12:15.812 --> 12:17.029
Wait. Wait.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.514
Please, stop.

12:18.515 --> 12:20.950
Just... just give me
a second, okay?

12:20.951 --> 12:22.818
I thought you said that he... Stop.

12:22.819 --> 12:23.953
Come on.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.972
I know Bob Barker's
not really... you know.

12:26.973 --> 12:28.690
I'm not crazy.

12:28.691 --> 12:30.526
I just...

12:31.361 --> 12:32.795
I needed that.

12:32.796 --> 12:34.630
I know it
may sound stupid,

12:34.631 --> 12:37.083
but I didn't always feel so
great about myself growing up,

12:37.084 --> 12:39.719
and so having a celebrity
dad made me feel special.

12:40.721 --> 12:43.089
But you're right, James.

12:43.090 --> 12:47.343
It's time to let go
of the fantasies.

12:47.344 --> 12:49.378
It's time to grow up.

12:49.379 --> 12:50.879
Come here.

13:07.748 --> 13:09.548
Can I help you?

13:09.549 --> 13:11.567
Yeah...

13:11.568 --> 13:13.502
you're Sam Gibbs.

13:13.503 --> 13:14.754
Yes.

13:15.905 --> 13:17.873
I'm James Stinson,

13:17.874 --> 13:19.842
and, I think

13:19.843 --> 13:22.744
you may have known my
mother, Loretta Stinson...

13:22.745 --> 13:24.547
in the '70s.

13:24.548 --> 13:25.765
Loretta!

13:27.134 --> 13:28.717
Yeah.

13:28.718 --> 13:31.604
Yeah, I... I knew Loretta.

13:31.605 --> 13:35.541
My mother meant
to send you this.

13:43.533 --> 13:46.935
You're my son.

13:58.048 --> 14:00.466
God, this must be
so hard for Barney.

14:01.567 --> 14:02.534
Yeah, but you know what?

14:02.535 --> 14:04.019
He took a big
step today...

14:04.020 --> 14:06.371
Papa!

14:16.703 --> 14:18.287
Look at us!

14:18.788 --> 14:21.440
It's like three
of the same guy.

14:22.109 --> 14:23.493
Oh, my God,
this explains

14:23.494 --> 14:25.962
why I was always so
awesome at basketball.

14:25.963 --> 14:28.447
Guys, I'm black!

14:29.416 --> 14:31.334
Sorry. African-American.

14:31.335 --> 14:33.886
No. I'm allowed
to say either.

14:33.887 --> 14:35.671
I got to go get my camera!

14:35.672 --> 14:38.491
That is my younger brother,
Barney.

14:38.492 --> 14:41.293
He just thought he'd meet
his real dad today,

14:41.294 --> 14:43.396
and clearly, he's not
taking it so well.

14:43.397 --> 14:45.148
Oh, my head's
kind of spinning, too.

14:45.149 --> 14:47.600
I mean, Loretta and
I only saw each other

14:47.601 --> 14:49.068
for a couple of months.

14:49.069 --> 14:51.521
You were two before
I even knew you existed,

14:51.522 --> 14:52.655
and at that point,

14:52.656 --> 14:53.906
your mother made it very clear

14:53.907 --> 14:55.792
she was going to
raise you on her own.

14:55.793 --> 14:59.162
I felt I had to
respect her wishes, but

14:59.163 --> 15:01.197
I always wanted to meet you.

15:01.198 --> 15:02.582
Wait!

15:02.583 --> 15:04.534
Barney and James
are two years apart.

15:04.535 --> 15:07.203
If Sam only knew Loretta
for a few months,

15:07.204 --> 15:09.255
he couldn't possibly
be Barney's father.

15:09.256 --> 15:13.226
He's also quite
the detective.

15:16.163 --> 15:17.496
Don't worry.
We'll...

15:17.497 --> 15:19.932
We'll snap Barney
out of this when he gets back.

15:19.933 --> 15:21.467
Or, we could just

15:21.468 --> 15:23.186
let him have
this one.

15:23.187 --> 15:25.138
What? Are you kidding?

15:25.139 --> 15:26.689
Guys, Barney's losing
his childhood home,

15:26.690 --> 15:29.025
he finally admitted
Bob Barker's not his dad,

15:29.026 --> 15:31.527
and then he watched James
meet his real father.

15:31.528 --> 15:33.579
It's just a lot to go
through in one afternoon.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.616
Can't we just let the
guy be black for a day?

15:38.452 --> 15:39.902
Here, Ted.
Capture the moment!

15:39.903 --> 15:41.654
I think you'd need Salvador Dali

15:41.655 --> 15:43.456
to capture
this particular moment,

15:43.457 --> 15:45.007
but I'll give it a whirl.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.577
Man...

15:47.578 --> 15:49.412
I thought
I was a light-skinned Caucasian,

15:49.413 --> 15:53.733
but in truth, I'm a really
light-skinned African-American.

15:53.734 --> 15:54.967
Man,

15:54.968 --> 15:56.869
try to hail a cab
in Manhattan.

15:56.870 --> 15:58.304
Am I right?

15:58.305 --> 16:01.007
Nope, no one's stopping
for this.

16:02.876 --> 16:04.927
These guys don't understand
what I'm talking about.

16:04.928 --> 16:08.898
<i>During that afternoon,
Sam and James began to discover</i>

16:08.899 --> 16:10.633
<i>how much they had in common.</i>

16:10.634 --> 16:15.071
* When the night has come *

16:16.273 --> 16:17.857
* Oh, and the land is dark *

16:17.858 --> 16:19.192
Come on. You know this. Come on.

16:19.193 --> 16:22.995
* And the moon is the
only * * The moon *

16:22.996 --> 16:25.047
* Light we see *
* Light we see *

16:25.048 --> 16:26.298
* Light we'll see *

16:26.299 --> 16:27.482
* Light we'll see *

16:27.483 --> 16:28.734
* Oh, I won't *
* Oh, I won't *

16:28.735 --> 16:29.735
* No, I wo-oh-on't *

16:29.736 --> 16:31.136
* Be afraid *
* Be afraid *

16:31.137 --> 16:32.171
* Hey! Ho *

16:32.172 --> 16:33.972
* I won't shed a tear *

16:33.973 --> 16:35.641
* No, I won't shed no tear *

16:35.642 --> 16:37.576
* Not as long *
* Not as long *

16:37.577 --> 16:38.944
* As you stand *
* As you stand *

16:38.945 --> 16:41.113
* Stand by me *
* Stand by me *

16:41.114 --> 16:42.481
There you go. Come on.

16:42.482 --> 16:44.983
* Whenever you're in trouble,
won't you stand *

16:44.984 --> 16:47.369
* Stand by me *

16:47.370 --> 16:50.122
* Stand by me, stand by me *
* Won't you stand? *

16:50.123 --> 16:52.391
* Won't you stand now?
Won't you stand now? Hey! *

16:52.392 --> 16:54.376
* Stand... *
* Stand... *

16:54.677 --> 16:56.261
- Weird day.
- Weird day.

16:59.465 --> 17:00.766
Hey, look at that!

17:00.767 --> 17:02.434
Liz still wants to meet you.

17:02.435 --> 17:03.619
That's great!

17:04.788 --> 17:06.038
I guess.

17:06.039 --> 17:07.489
Wait a minute.

17:07.490 --> 17:10.209
You said Liz was a total ten.

17:10.210 --> 17:11.743
Why would she want to meet

17:11.744 --> 17:13.944
the incontinent freak
show you described?

17:15.865 --> 17:17.500
You oversold her!

17:17.701 --> 17:18.983
Maybe a little.

17:18.984 --> 17:19.969
You said she was a ten.

17:19.970 --> 17:22.171
I did not specify on what scale.

17:22.172 --> 17:23.955
You said she looked
like a movie star.

17:23.957 --> 17:25.124
She does.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.208
It's Robert De Niro,

17:26.209 --> 17:28.761
but, like, super buff,
like in Cape Fear.

17:29.763 --> 17:32.348
Dad, look how fast
I can run!

17:32.349 --> 17:34.884
He's actually
a really sweet guy,

17:34.885 --> 17:37.136
and he's great
with my son.

17:37.137 --> 17:38.604
I have a grandson?

17:41.024 --> 17:43.192
His name's Eli.

17:47.397 --> 17:49.982
He's beautiful.

17:49.983 --> 17:52.368
Dad, you're not
looking!

17:52.369 --> 17:53.786
<i>Eventually,</i>

17:53.787 --> 17:56.322
<i>the strangest afternoon
of our lives wound to a close,</i>

17:56.323 --> 17:58.174
<i>and we headed back
to Staten Island,</i>

17:58.175 --> 18:00.826
<i>where Barney and his mom had
a long overdue heart-to-heart.</i>

18:00.827 --> 18:03.362
Barney?

18:03.363 --> 18:04.363
I need to talk to you.

18:04.364 --> 18:05.664
Me first.

18:05.665 --> 18:07.132
Mom,

18:07.133 --> 18:08.868
there's something
that I need to ask you,

18:08.869 --> 18:11.337
and I... I want you
to be honest with me.

18:14.241 --> 18:18.060
Why do white people
like Carrot Top?

18:23.216 --> 18:25.734
Listen...

18:25.735 --> 18:30.239
I always wanted
to be enough for you boys.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.241
I think that's why
it always hurt

18:32.242 --> 18:34.193
whenever you asked
about your dads,

18:34.194 --> 18:35.661
because I was always

18:35.662 --> 18:38.998
trying so hard
to be both parents for you.

18:38.999 --> 18:41.166
But I was being selfish.

18:42.369 --> 18:44.903
You deserve the truth.

18:46.239 --> 18:48.257
So here it is.

18:48.258 --> 18:50.242
Sam is not your father.

18:51.077 --> 18:53.412
Are you sure?

18:53.413 --> 18:54.847
Yes.

18:54.848 --> 18:56.849
He's black, dear.

18:59.019 --> 19:03.405
But if you want, I can tell you
who your father really is.

19:04.274 --> 19:06.892
<i>And at that moment,</i>

19:06.893 --> 19:09.144
<i>Barney suddenly saw
his childhood</i>

19:09.145 --> 19:11.730
<i>more clearly
than he ever had before.</i>

19:13.867 --> 19:16.368
I'm sorry, but your son
can't be on the team.

19:16.369 --> 19:17.736
He's terrible.

19:20.957 --> 19:22.575
What'd Coach say, Ma?

19:22.576 --> 19:24.994
He said you're simply too
good to be on the team.

19:24.995 --> 19:27.162
It's not fair
to the other boys.

19:27.163 --> 19:28.581
But that's okay.

19:28.582 --> 19:31.283
We can just play together
in the backyard.

19:32.135 --> 19:34.470
Why didn't anyone come?

19:34.471 --> 19:36.121
Oh, you know what, dear?

19:36.122 --> 19:39.425
Apparently, there was a
mix-up with the mail.

19:39.426 --> 19:43.145
I just got this letter from
the Postmaster General.

19:43.146 --> 19:46.715
"Dear Barney,
I sincerely apologize

19:46.716 --> 19:49.234
"for losing all the invitations

19:49.235 --> 19:52.271
you sent out to your
eighth birthday party."

20:07.186 --> 20:08.403
Barney.

20:08.404 --> 20:09.471
It's okay, Mom.

20:09.472 --> 20:10.856
I don't need it.

20:10.857 --> 20:12.741
But it's your father.

20:12.742 --> 20:15.160
I already have a father.

20:16.179 --> 20:18.196
And his name...

20:18.197 --> 20:20.866
is Loretta.

20:23.202 --> 20:26.237
<i>Kids, your uncle Barney
grew up without a dad.</i>

20:26.238 --> 20:28.373
<i>And it always made
him feel incomplete.</i>

20:28.374 --> 20:30.409
<i>But as he hugged Loretta,</i>

20:30.410 --> 20:33.944
<i>so around by the boxes into
his happy childhood,</i>

20:33.945 --> 20:38.232
<i>he realized he had
one hell of a mom.</i>

20:41.237 --> 20:43.354
* If the sky *
* If the sky *

20:43.355 --> 20:46.925
* We look upon *
* Mmm... *

20:46.926 --> 20:49.811
* Should tumble and fall *
* Should tumble and fall *

20:49.812 --> 20:54.315
* Or the mountains
should crumble *

20:54.316 --> 20:56.768
* To the sea,
to the sea... *

20:56.769 --> 20:59.905
Wait. Dad! James!

20:59.906 --> 21:01.056
Where are you going?

21:01.057 --> 21:03.458
That's the best part.

21:04.459 --> 21:05.900
Can we go camping?
