09:32.812 --> 09:34.846
<i>Sanchez: She's got a lot
of medical bills, and...</i>

09:34.848 --> 09:38.149
<i>High Star offered six times the
pay to go back and do the</i>

09:38.151 --> 09:42.720
<i>same job I was doing, so...
Parsons: Look, uh, I'll be</i>

09:42.722 --> 09:43.688
<i>honest with you, Chris.</i>

09:43.690 --> 09:48.026
<i>I'm here because I'm looking into
High Star and Howard Erickson.</i>

09:48.028 --> 09:49.794
<i>Sanchez: What for?</i>

09:49.796 --> 09:52.497
<i>You looking to try a case
against them or something?</i>

09:52.499 --> 09:54.699
<i>Parsons: If there's
a case to be tried.</i>

09:54.701 --> 09:57.602
<i>I was curious about your
experience with them.</i>

09:57.604 --> 10:01.339
<i>Sanchez: They get
a bad rap, but...</i>

10:01.341 --> 10:05.543
<i>You shouldn't believe the
shit you see in the news.</i>

10:05.545 --> 10:07.645
<i>They were always
really good to me.</i>

10:07.647 --> 10:10.715
<i>Parsons: Then why
did you leave?</i>

10:12.217 --> 10:14.285
<i>Sanchez: You're not
looking to sue me, are you?</i>

10:14.287 --> 10:17.622
<i>'Cause, don't forget, I got
all sorts of dirt on you.</i>

10:17.624 --> 10:18.723

10:18.725 --> 10:25.163
<i>You definitely do.</i>

10:25.165 --> 10:28.733
<i>Sanchez: I didn't leave
because of the company.</i>

10:28.735 --> 10:33.404
<i>They offered me a... a...
A promotion, actually.</i>

10:33.406 --> 10:35.740
<i>I was just burned out.</i>

10:35.742 --> 10:36.808
<i>It was time to come back home.</i>

10:36.810 --> 10:39.410
<i>Parsons: I can't
even imagine.</i>

10:39.412 --> 10:43.981
<i>Sanchez: Not that being
home is, uh, some big prize.</i>

10:43.983 --> 10:48.920
<i>The whole experience was...
Surreal.</i>

10:48.922 --> 10:51.422
<i>Parsons: Surreal how?</i>

10:51.424 --> 10:58.429
<i>Sanchez: The week after I
get back, it's Halloween.</i>

10:58.431 --> 11:04.569
<i>I'm on my mom's porch
handing out candy.</i>

11:04.571 --> 11:08.673
<i>Eight-year-old GI.

<i>Like it's all a big joke.</i>

11:15.814 --> 11:16.781
<i>Fuck it.</i>

11:16.783 --> 11:19.217
<i>Maybe it's just me.</i>

11:19.219 --> 11:20.418
<i>Sorry to go on like that.</i>

11:20.420 --> 11:24.155
<i>Parsons: No, it must
be difficult, like...</i>

11:24.157 --> 11:26.591
<i>I can't even imagine.</i>

11:29.328 --> 11:31.329
<i>Sanchez: It's just strange
walking through the neighborhood</i>

11:31.331 --> 11:34.432
<i>when you feel like you gotta
keep checking rooftops.</i>

11:34.434 --> 11:36.901
<i>Parsons: Did something happen
to you over there, while you</i>

11:36.903 --> 11:38.803
<i>were working for Erickson?</i>

11:38.805 --> 11:42.273
<i>Sanchez: Look, Ellen, I'm
really glad to see you...</i>

11:42.275 --> 11:46.144
<i>But I don't want to talk
about High Star anymore.</i>

11:46.146 --> 11:47.478
<i>Parsons: Of course.</i>

11:47.480 --> 11:48.479
<i>I understand.</i>

11:48.481 --> 11:50.448
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

11:50.450 --> 11:51.482
<i>Sanchez: All right.</i>

11:51.484 --> 11:55.453
<i>And I don't care what you
say-- Next round's on me.</i>

12:08.000 --> 12:10.601
<i>Everett: Did he tell you
why he left High Star?</i>

12:10.603 --> 12:15.139
<i>Parsons: No, but something
happened before Halloween which</i>

12:15.141 --> 12:16.307
<i>made him leave the company.</i>

12:16.309 --> 12:18.309
<i>Everett: What'd he say?</i>

12:18.311 --> 12:22.280
<i>Parsons: He wouldn't explain
it, but there's something wrong.</i>

12:22.282 --> 12:24.582
<i>I mean, he was a different
person in high school.</i>

12:24.584 --> 12:26.350
<i>He was... upbeat, outgoing.</i>

12:26.352 --> 12:29.353
<i>Everett: What was your
relationship with this guy, anyway?</i>

12:29.355 --> 12:32.924
<i>Parsons: I let him cheat
off of me in geometry class.</i>

12:32.926 --> 12:33.925
<i>Everett: That's hot.</i>

12:33.927 --> 12:34.992
<i>(Both laugh)</i>

12:34.994 --> 12:38.029
<i>Parsons: It's kind
of hot when you're 16.</i>

12:38.031 --> 12:40.198
<i>But we ended up dating
for, like, 15 minutes.</i>

12:40.200 --> 12:41.332
<i>He was a good guy.</i>

12:41.334 --> 12:44.836
<i>Everett: Look, I know you feel
pressure to bring in a case...</i>

12:44.838 --> 12:47.872
<i>Parsons: I've brought
in plenty of cases.</i>

12:47.874 --> 12:49.440
<i>They've just all been rejected.</i>

12:49.442 --> 12:52.844
<i>Everett: Maybe because
they were long shots.</i>

12:52.846 --> 12:55.680
<i>Parsons: I think if I could
spend a little more time with</i>

12:55.682 --> 12:57.448
<i>him, I could get him to open up.</i>

12:57.450 --> 13:00.051
<i>Everett: What is it
with you and High Star?</i>

13:00.053 --> 13:03.821
<i>Parsons: They're a private
army, killing for a profit.</i>

13:03.823 --> 13:05.857
<i>Making money off of death.</i>

13:05.859 --> 13:12.029
<i>Everett: If he's a friend, maybe
you don't want to push him.</i>

13:21.540 --> 13:24.041
<i>(Speaking arabic)</i>

13:46.532 --> 13:49.000
<i>Maggie: Mr. Girotto's here.</i>

13:49.002 --> 13:50.034
<i>Girotto: Thank you.</i>

13:50.036 --> 13:51.702
<i>Hewes: Hello, James.</i>

13:51.704 --> 13:53.905
<i>How many hours of sleep
did you get last night?</i>

13:53.907 --> 13:54.906
<i>Girotto: Cut
the shit, Patty.</i>

13:54.908 --> 13:56.474
<i>Hewes: Oh, I got seven.</i>

13:56.476 --> 13:58.476
<i>The most restful sleep
I've had in months.</i>

13:58.478 --> 13:59.477
<i>Girotto: That's fantastic.</i>

13:59.479 --> 14:00.478
<i>Can we get on with this?</i>

14:00.480 --> 14:02.480
<i>My client's been waiting a year
to schedule this deposition.</i>

14:02.482 --> 14:05.216
<i>Hewes: Your client's
deposition is part of discovery</i>

14:05.218 --> 14:07.718
<i>in a case that involves the
deaths of dozens of people.</i>

14:07.720 --> 14:10.421
<i>I think a little patience
isn't going to hurt anyone.</i>

14:10.423 --> 14:12.423
<i>Girotto: I'm late for
my kid's science fair.</i>

14:12.425 --> 14:13.424
<i>What are your terms?</i>

14:13.426 --> 14:15.993
<i>Hewes: The deposition
will be held in my offices.</i>

14:15.995 --> 14:17.028
<i>Girotto: That's fine.</i>

14:17.030 --> 14:18.029
<i>Hewes: Seven days.</i>

14:18.031 --> 14:20.064
<i>Girotto: He's flying in
from Paris-- You get one.</i>

14:20.066 --> 14:22.099
<i>Hewes: Your client didn't
develop a deadly vaccine</i>

14:22.101 --> 14:24.168
<i>overnight-- Six days.</i>

14:24.170 --> 14:25.670
<i>Girotto: Three.</i>

14:25.672 --> 14:27.038
<i>Hewes: Five.</i>

14:27.040 --> 14:28.539
<i>Or he can wait another year.</i>

14:28.541 --> 14:31.075
<i>Girotto: If you agree to
limit your questions to the</i>

14:31.077 --> 14:32.577
<i>trial-to-market period.</i>

14:32.579 --> 14:34.745
<i>Hewes: What else?</i>

14:34.747 --> 14:35.880
<i>Girotto: I want
a translator.</i>

14:35.882 --> 14:38.249
<i>Hewes: I saw your client on
Charlie Rose; His English is</i>

14:38.251 --> 14:40.651
better than his French.

14:42.087 --> 14:46.757
We haven't tried a case against
each other in over a decade, James.

14:46.759 --> 14:47.758
You still bitter?

14:47.760 --> 14:49.760
Girotto: I don't
like to lose.

14:49.762 --> 14:50.761
(Hewes laughs)

14:50.763 --> 14:53.064
Hewes: Well, get used to it.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.866
Anything else I can get
you for the deposition?

14:55.868 --> 14:57.101
Croissants?

14:57.103 --> 14:58.235
A beret?

14:58.237 --> 14:59.904
Giotto: Fuck you, Patty.

14:59.906 --> 15:03.541
Hewes: Have a lovely day.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.809
(Bell jingles)

16:13.679 --> 16:14.745
Sanchez: Hey.

16:14.747 --> 16:17.081
Parsons: Hey.

16:19.651 --> 16:22.486
She's beautiful.

16:22.488 --> 16:23.521
Sanchez: Ghwarri.

16:23.523 --> 16:27.124
Say hello to Ellen Parsons.

16:27.126 --> 16:28.993
Hey. Ellen and I go way back.

16:28.995 --> 16:30.861
You can trust her.

16:30.863 --> 16:34.098
She's one of the good ones.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.167
Parsons: (Kissing) Hello.

16:37.703 --> 16:39.103
Where did you get her?

16:39.105 --> 16:40.971
Sanchez: She's a rescue.

16:40.973 --> 16:44.442
Found her in a bombed-out
apartment in Afghanistan.

16:44.444 --> 16:46.477
Parsons: "Ghwarri"?

16:46.479 --> 16:47.645
Sanchez: It's Pashto.

16:47.647 --> 16:51.315
It means something
like "fatso,"

16:51.317 --> 16:57.521
even though she was...
Practically starving when I found her.

16:57.523 --> 16:59.824
Parsons: What's this?

16:59.826 --> 17:03.527
Sanchez: It's a
medallion from my unit.

17:06.364 --> 17:10.667
Why did you want to see me?

17:10.670 --> 17:15.539
Parsons: It was, uh...
I was thinking about something you said.

17:15.540 --> 17:16.906
Sanchez: What's that?

17:16.909 --> 17:20.411
Parsons: You came home
a week before Halloween.

17:20.413 --> 17:23.414
Sanchez: Yeah? So?

17:25.916 --> 17:29.687
Parsons: I read an article
saying that that week three

17:29.689 --> 17:33.357
employees of High Star died.

17:33.359 --> 17:38.195
Jay Rayburn, Robert
Franks, and Thomas Lowry.

17:38.197 --> 17:42.099
Did you work with any of them?

17:42.101 --> 17:44.668
Sanchez: Rayburn,
Franks and who?

17:44.670 --> 17:47.271
Parsons: Thomas Lowry.

17:47.273 --> 17:51.041
Sanchez: No.
I don't know them.

17:51.043 --> 17:53.944
High Star has thousands of men
on the ground over there.

17:53.946 --> 17:56.747
Parsons: In this article,
Thomas Lowry's widow thinks that

17:56.749 --> 18:00.584
High Star violated the terms
of her husband's contract.

18:00.586 --> 18:04.054
So I was wondering, would you mind
if I took a look at your contract?

18:04.056 --> 18:08.392
Sanchez: I don't mind, but
I don't have my contract.

18:08.394 --> 18:11.495
I don't keep shit like that.

18:12.898 --> 18:15.299
Boorman: Hey,
it's Jerry Boorman.

18:15.301 --> 18:16.133
Real good.

18:16.135 --> 18:17.902
How about you?

18:17.904 --> 18:19.603
(Chuckles)

18:19.605 --> 18:20.437
The Knicks?

18:20.439 --> 18:22.406
(Laughs)

18:22.408 --> 18:24.575
No, I can't help you there.

18:24.577 --> 18:26.210
(Laughs)

18:26.212 --> 18:29.914
Listen, I-I-I got a name I
want you to run for me.

18:29.916 --> 18:32.783
Parsons-- Ellen Parsons.

18:32.785 --> 18:36.420
And I'm going to need
her phone tapped.

18:36.422 --> 18:38.722
Yeah, sure.

18:38.724 --> 18:42.459
P-a-r... (Chuckles)

18:42.461 --> 18:45.896
Yeah.

18:45.898 --> 18:51.101
Parsons: Look, I won't ask
about High Star anymore.

18:51.103 --> 18:54.071
But...
Will you at least talk to me?

18:54.073 --> 18:57.107
If you've been through something...
Sanchez: There's nothing I

18:57.109 --> 18:58.075
want to talk about.

18:58.077 --> 19:00.711
Parsons: I know from personal
experiences, these kind of

19:00.713 --> 19:03.747
things, they can just
eat away at you.

19:06.885 --> 19:09.086
A few years ago, my fiancé died.

19:09.088 --> 19:10.788
I went to trauma counseling.

19:10.790 --> 19:12.756
I didn't want to go.

19:12.758 --> 19:15.926
I didn't think I needed it, I thought
I could handle it by myself.

19:15.928 --> 19:20.097
But the truth is, I couldn't.

19:20.099 --> 19:26.036
Talking to someone
really helped.

19:26.038 --> 19:32.176
I understand if you don't want to talk
to me, but you should see someone.

19:32.178 --> 19:33.177
(Coins clatter onto floor)

19:33.179 --> 19:34.178
Woman: Shit.

19:34.180 --> 19:36.480
(Ghwarri barks)

19:36.482 --> 19:38.048
Woman: Sorry about that.

19:38.050 --> 19:40.050
Sorry.

19:40.052 --> 19:42.286
(Barking continues)

19:42.288 --> 19:43.821
Sanchez: It's okay.

19:43.823 --> 19:45.890
(Ghwarri whining)

19:49.060 --> 19:53.097
Parsons: I'm not...
I'm not just here as an attorney, Chris.

19:56.067 --> 19:58.102
I'm here as a friend.

20:11.549 --> 20:13.584
♪ ♪

20:57.162 --> 20:59.697

Glory be, that feels good!

Erickson: Not to

really know how to treat a lady.

21:07.773 --> 21:08.772
Whoo!

My daddy's hootin'

21:10.476 --> 21:11.809
in heaven right now.

Erickson: We're not authorized
to give all the details.

21:16.248 --> 21:19.450

details, just what the fuck is it?

21:19.452 --> 21:21.852
Erickson: Congresswoman, I'd
like you to meet my head of ops

training, Anthony Carter.

21:23.255 --> 21:24.254
Congresswoman: Hey, Anthony.

21:24.256 --> 21:26.256
Anthony: It's a
submachine gun, ma'am.

21:26.258 --> 21:28.292
Similar to the kris super-v, but
we made some custom adjustments

21:28.294 --> 21:30.260
to address our needs
in the field.

21:30.262 --> 21:32.262
Congresswoman:
Oh, it's a beauty.

21:32.264 --> 21:35.265
Anthony: Less than a dozen people
in the world have fired one of these.

21:35.267 --> 21:37.301
Erickson: We like it 'cause
it sits soft and supple in your

21:37.303 --> 21:38.268
arms, like a sleeping baby.

21:38.270 --> 21:40.971
Once she wakes up, she could
lay out Optimus Prime.

21:40.973 --> 21:42.639
Congresswoman: Oh, yeah!

Well, I thank you
for the thrill.

21:45.578 --> 21:46.777

21:46.779 --> 21:49.113
Anthony: Yes, sir.

Congresswoman: But it's
not going to change my vote.

21:51.951 --> 21:55.252
Erickson: What kind of a dog and
pony show was that up at the hearing?

21:55.254 --> 21:56.320
Congresswoman: I'm sorry.

21:56.322 --> 21:58.989
My constituents have
turned against this war.

21:58.991 --> 22:02.326
And they don't want to see me
rolling over for a guy like you.

22:02.328 --> 22:05.696
Erickson: In the past, I was
always able to count on your support.

22:05.698 --> 22:09.867
Congresswoman: Look, Afghanistan
is the longest war in U.S. history.

22:09.869 --> 22:13.504
The people I represent don't know
what the hell we're doing over there.

22:13.506 --> 22:14.605
Erickson: But we are there.

22:14.607 --> 22:16.607
Congresswoman: I
am not your problem.

22:16.609 --> 22:18.675
Even if I vote to renew,
you still lose.

22:18.677 --> 22:20.978
It's congressman Shipley that's
calling the shots in that

22:20.980 --> 22:25.115
committee; He's got all the
votes against you lined up.

22:25.117 --> 22:27.651
Erickson: Can you get
me a meeting with Shipley?

22:27.653 --> 22:28.652
Congresswoman: No.

22:28.654 --> 22:31.021
Shipley doesn't want to
be caught dead with you.

22:31.023 --> 22:33.023
Erickson: That's
why I need you.

22:33.025 --> 22:35.626
And your rocky Mountain charm.

22:35.628 --> 22:38.295
I'm sure he owes you
a favor or two.

22:38.297 --> 22:39.363

Erickson: All I want is a
conversation with the man.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.667
Congresswoman: I'll
see what I can do.

22:43.669 --> 22:47.137
Erickson: It will
be most appreciated.

Hewes: Hi, boy.

22:50.409 --> 22:51.575
Who's a good boy?

22:51.577 --> 22:52.576
Did you have a good day?

22:52.578 --> 22:53.977
Good boy.

22:53.979 --> 22:54.978

22:54.980 --> 22:56.080
I'm home.

22:56.082 --> 22:57.748
Holly: We're over here.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.883
On the floor.

22:59.885 --> 23:01.485
Hewes: What are you doing?

23:01.487 --> 23:02.486
Holly: Grandma's home.

23:02.488 --> 23:04.555
You ready to do the
cake and presents?

23:04.557 --> 23:05.656
I got a cake.

23:05.658 --> 23:07.658
Catherine wanted to stay
up and celebrate with you.

23:07.660 --> 23:10.994
Hewes: Celebrate what?

23:10.996 --> 23:13.263
Holly: I'm sorry, Ms. Hewes.

23:13.265 --> 23:19.670
It's... you forgot her birthday.

23:19.672 --> 23:23.140
Hewes: Oh, is it
Wednesday already?

23:25.043 --> 23:26.443
Well, I guess it must be.

23:26.445 --> 23:29.079
Holly: It said on the
calendar you gave me that today

23:29.081 --> 23:32.116
was Catherine's birthday.

23:32.118 --> 23:33.750
You're an incredibly
busy woman.

23:33.752 --> 23:35.385
I understand.

23:35.387 --> 23:40.224
Hewes: Thank you for
understanding, Holly?.

23:40.226 --> 23:43.260
Happy Birthday, sweetheart.

23:46.664 --> 23:48.966

27:30.222 --> 27:32.956
Hewes: Yes, it is.

27:32.958 --> 27:36.927
And I want you to know that
I appreciate your effort

27:36.929 --> 27:40.297
and the bond that you've tried
to create with Catherine.

Holly: Of course.

28:02.020 --> 28:04.621
Hewes: It specifically
stated that there was to be no

28:04.623 --> 28:06.990

Now this cake is
loaded with it.

Holly: Ms. Hewes, you made
it very clear that I had

28:13.031 --> 28:16.700
discretion over Catherine's diet, and...
Hewes: You know, I like you,

28:16.702 --> 28:18.602
Holly?-- I do-- But
you're careless.

28:18.604 --> 28:19.436
Holly: Careless?

28:19.438 --> 28:21.872
Hewes: Yes.
And I can't have that.

28:21.874 --> 28:26.276
We're not a good fit, and
you're not good for Catherine.

28:26.278 --> 28:27.377
So pack your things.

28:27.379 --> 28:29.880
There's a check waiting
for you downstairs.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.015
Good night.

28:43.828 --> 28:46.263
(Door opens, closes)

28:49.100 --> 28:51.735
Everett: I didn't exactly
know how to bring it up or even

28:51.737 --> 28:57.541
that I should, but...
You're still in touch with Patty Hewes, right?

28:57.543 --> 28:58.842
Parsons: From time to time.

28:58.844 --> 29:02.612
Everett: Well, I think you
should know I heard the

29:02.614 --> 29:08.351
partners talking about Patty, and,
well, they're not all fans.

29:08.353 --> 29:13.323
I got the feeling that it could
create some waves if they knew.

29:13.325 --> 29:17.561
Parsons: Thanks for
looking out for me.

29:17.563 --> 29:21.264
Everett: You never
really talk about her.

29:21.266 --> 29:23.366
It's interesting that
you still see her.

29:23.368 --> 29:29.039
I thought you two
didn't get along.

29:29.041 --> 29:32.042
Parsons: After her partner died...
Everett: Tom Shayes?

29:32.044 --> 29:33.877
Parsons: Yeah, yeah.

29:33.879 --> 29:37.881
Um, we, we didn't
talk for over a year.

29:37.883 --> 29:39.249
We just went our separate ways.

29:39.251 --> 29:44.120
But then out of the blue she
got in touch with me again.

29:44.122 --> 29:45.288
Wanted to meet up.

29:45.290 --> 29:47.390
And at first I said no.

29:47.392 --> 29:50.560
Everett: What
changed your mind?

29:50.562 --> 29:55.632
Parsons: She was very persistent...
And I realized she

29:55.634 --> 29:57.601
could be useful to me.

29:57.603 --> 30:03.373
Everett: You run legal
strategy by her, pick her brain.

30:06.077 --> 30:08.778
(Thunder rumbling)

30:13.017 --> 30:16.219
Carter: Sancho,
good to see you, man.

30:16.221 --> 30:17.153
Sanchez: You, too.

30:17.155 --> 30:17.988
(Ghwarri whining)

30:18.824 --> 30:22.058
Sanchez: I'm sorry
I cut out early.

30:22.060 --> 30:25.395
I just couldn't stay
over there anymore.

30:25.397 --> 30:27.998
Carter: You don't got to
explain anything to me, man.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.036
That last shit you went through
is about as hairy as it gets.

30:35.339 --> 30:38.842
So, you really not coming
back to High Star?

30:38.844 --> 30:42.312
Sanchez: I'm done.

30:42.314 --> 30:44.214
Carter: I understand.

30:44.216 --> 30:46.983
Sanchez: I'm sorry.

30:46.985 --> 30:50.620
You'd be the only
reason I come back.

30:50.622 --> 30:52.489
I hate leaving you a man down.

30:52.491 --> 30:54.257
Carter: We got replacements.

30:54.259 --> 30:57.961
Of course, it's not like anybody
could really replace you.

30:57.963 --> 31:01.064
But if you're done, you're done.

31:01.066 --> 31:04.701
You gotta do what's
best for you.

31:07.538 --> 31:12.676
Chris, why did you
want to see me?

31:12.678 --> 31:16.079
Sanchez: I'm not good.

31:16.081 --> 31:17.180
Carter: What's up?

31:17.182 --> 31:19.516
(Thunder rumbling)

31:19.518 --> 31:23.253
Sanchez: I can't
sleep, for one.

31:23.255 --> 31:24.254
Carter: Yeah?

31:24.256 --> 31:25.622
Sanchez: Yeah.

31:25.624 --> 31:27.123
Carter: Where's
your head at?

31:27.125 --> 31:30.193
Sanchez: Who knows.

31:30.195 --> 31:34.431
Every fucking thing
is out of whack.

31:34.433 --> 31:40.537
I wake up...
I keep thinking I should be dead.

31:40.539 --> 31:46.743
Takes me a few minutes to realize I'm
not, then I get up, I walk the dog,

31:46.745 --> 31:48.144
and the day just goes by.

31:48.146 --> 31:51.014
Carter: You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

31:51.016 --> 32:00.223
Sanchez: I was thinking of
going to the VA... but I can't.

32:04.028 --> 32:06.896
When I left the corps,
my head was fine.

32:06.898 --> 32:09.399
It was clear as a bell.

32:09.401 --> 32:11.935
It wasn't till this last mission
with High Star that I...

32:11.937 --> 32:14.237
Carter: Hey, we can help.

32:14.239 --> 32:15.505
The company's got good people.

32:15.507 --> 32:18.675
I can get you a name.

32:18.677 --> 32:22.412
Sanchez: That'd
be good, I think.

32:22.414 --> 32:25.615
Carter: You hang
in there, Sancho.

32:27.418 --> 32:29.819
I'll find you someone.

32:35.059 --> 32:37.560
Boy: You guys break one of
those, dad's gonna kick your ass.

32:37.562 --> 32:40.196
Erickson: You men have about two seconds...
Boy: Shit!

32:40.198 --> 32:43.066
Erickson: to stop doing
anything I'm not supposed to see.

32:47.572 --> 32:49.706
(Boys chuckle)

32:49.708 --> 32:54.177
Amidst the turmoil, injustice
and evil in this world, we ask

32:54.179 --> 32:59.916
ourselves "how can
we persevere?"

32:59.918 --> 33:06.356
In this season of joy and peace,
I believe we can find comfort

33:06.358 --> 33:08.391
in our commitments.

33:08.393 --> 33:14.431
Commitments to our faith, to
our family, to our country.

33:14.433 --> 33:18.935
Jesus teaches us to
love, to commit.

33:18.937 --> 33:26.509
He teaches us moral strength in a
world of weakness and cowardice.

33:26.511 --> 33:32.582
To combat this weakness,
what does he give us?

33:32.584 --> 33:34.617
Boy: The gift of
our our convictions.

33:34.619 --> 33:35.618
Erickson: That's right.

33:35.620 --> 33:36.953
The gift of our convictions.

33:36.955 --> 33:39.689
In Jesus' name, we pray.

33:39.691 --> 33:41.291
Boys: Amen.

33:41.293 --> 33:43.693
Erickson: Amen.

forward to seeing you.

34:34.579 --> 34:36.813
Parsons: Okay, great.

34:36.815 --> 34:37.647
See you there.

34:37.649 --> 34:39.783
Hewes: Thanks for
calling, Ellen.

34:39.784 --> 34:42.217
See you soon.

34:43.788 --> 34:48.458
Parsons: What do you know about
Howard Erickson and High Star Security?

34:48.460 --> 34:49.525
Hewes: High Star?

34:49.527 --> 34:50.793
Parsons: Yeah.

34:50.795 --> 34:54.429
Hewes: Be careful, Ellen.

34:54.431 --> 34:57.200
Parsons: You didn't
answer my question.

34:57.202 --> 35:00.103
Hewes: High Star's a
very dangerous target.

35:00.105 --> 35:03.540
Dozens of lawyers have tried
to build a case against them,

35:03.542 --> 35:04.340
and it's never worked.

35:04.342 --> 35:06.176
It's a company
that's protected.

35:06.178 --> 35:10.280
Parsons: That's
what interests me.

35:12.216 --> 35:15.151
Hewes: You've been working for NYE
& Everett for two and a half years.

35:15.153 --> 35:17.620
Are you bored?

35:17.622 --> 35:20.256
Parsons: I want to try cases
that matter to me and I want to

35:20.258 --> 35:22.292
try them my way.

35:24.228 --> 35:30.133
Hewes: Sounds like you're thinking
about going out on your own.

35:30.135 --> 35:33.770
All the more reason to
stay away from High Star.

35:36.841 --> 35:42.111
If you want to build a name for
yourself, start your own firm,

35:42.113 --> 35:46.049
you need to find a
case that you can win.

35:46.051 --> 35:48.852
Parsons: I have a friend who
I went to high school with who

35:48.854 --> 35:51.087
worked for High Star.

35:51.089 --> 35:55.992
He may know some things.

35:55.994 --> 35:59.062
I'm worried about
getting him involved.

35:59.064 --> 36:02.765
Hewes: You should be.

36:02.767 --> 36:07.570
You know, you talk about wanting
to do it your way, but there's

36:07.572 --> 36:13.776
only one way to try a case, Ellen--
Whatever way allows you to win it.

36:15.946 --> 36:24.787
But if you also want to have a
life or balance or a family,

36:24.789 --> 36:28.024
or protect your friend...

36:35.666 --> 36:39.102
You know, I never answered
your question three years ago.

36:39.104 --> 36:40.270
Parsons: What question?

36:40.272 --> 36:45.508
Hewes: Right after Tom died,
we were out at the beach house,

36:45.510 --> 36:50.213
you asked me if it
was all worth it.

36:50.215 --> 36:51.781
Parsons: And?

36:51.783 --> 36:57.120
Hewes: If you have to ask the
question, you already have your answer.

He's in bad shape.

You're the one recruited him.

Erickson: All right, then, give him Dr.
Barrera's info.

39:13.324 --> 39:16.559
He's the best
headshrinker we have.

39:22.066 --> 39:26.569
Here, I want you to have one
of these for your tree, AC.

39:26.571 --> 39:28.938
Happy holidays.

39:28.940 --> 39:31.841
Carter: Thank you, sir.

39:31.843 --> 39:35.111
Any word from congresswoman Chase
on getting the meeting set

39:35.113 --> 39:36.079
up with the swing vote?

39:36.081 --> 39:38.448
Will Shipley meet with you
about renewing your contracts?

39:38.450 --> 39:40.183
Erickson: She's doing
everything she can.

39:40.185 --> 39:41.918
We just gotta have faith.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.020
Girotto: Objection: He's
already answered the question.

39:44.022 --> 39:47.623
Hewes: When you bring a new
drug to market, Mr. Coupet, does

39:47.625 --> 39:50.259
your company always
conduct clinical trials?

39:50.261 --> 39:51.260
<i>Coupet (French accent): Oui.</i>

39:51.262 --> 39:52.595
<i>Hewes: English, please.</i>

39:52.597 --> 39:53.930
<i>Coupet: Excuse me.</i>

39:53.932 --> 39:57.967
<i>Yes, we conduct clinical trials
for every drug we develop.</i>

39:57.969 --> 40:00.770
<i>Hewes: Mr. Coupet, did you
personally oversee the</i>

40:00.772 --> 40:03.773
<i>development of a vaccine
called Tranzec?</i>

40:03.775 --> 40:04.941
<i>Girotto: Objection. Mr.</i>

40:04.943 --> 40:08.544
<i>Coupet is neither a
scientist nor a physician.</i>

40:08.546 --> 40:11.814
<i>Hewes: As CEO, did you ever
have occasion to hear the term</i>

40:11.816 --> 40:13.616
<i>"adverse event"?</i>

40:13.618 --> 40:14.951
<i>Coupet: Yes.</i>

40:14.953 --> 40:16.619
<i>Hewes: In your industry, Mr.</i>

40:16.621 --> 40:20.623
<i>Coupet, what is meant by an
adverse event in the testing of</i>

40:20.625 --> 40:21.791
<i>a new drug?</i>

40:21.793 --> 40:28.297
<i>Coupet: It can mean many things,
Rashes, fevers, many things.</i>

40:28.299 --> 40:31.467
<i>Hewes: In some cases,
can it mean death?</i>

40:31.469 --> 40:34.971
<i>Coupet: This is
very rare, but yes.</i>

40:34.973 --> 40:40.176
<i>Hewes: More specifically, an
adverse event can mean that a</i>

40:40.178 --> 40:42.345
<i>subject in a clinical
trial has died.</i>

40:42.347 --> 40:43.479
<i>Is that correct?</i>

40:43.481 --> 40:45.982
<i>Girotto: Objection, He's
already answered the question.</i>

40:45.984 --> 40:48.417
<i>Hewes: I want
it on the record.</i>

40:48.419 --> 40:49.418
<i>Is that correct, Mr. Coupet?</i>

40:49.420 --> 40:50.453
<i>Girotto: Objection.</i>

40:50.455 --> 40:51.420
<i>Hewes: To what?</i>

40:51.422 --> 40:52.788
<i>Girotto: To her.</i>

40:52.790 --> 40:56.692
<i>I mean, whose fucking
kid is this?</i>

40:56.694 --> 40:57.994
<i>Hewes: Maggie?</i>

40:57.996 --> 40:59.795
<i>Girotto: Whose
fucking kid is this?</i>

40:59.797 --> 41:01.397
<i>Hewes: Maggie!</i>

41:05.302 --> 41:08.137
<i>Barrera: So, have you
ever talked to a therapist</i>

41:08.139 --> 41:09.338
<i>before, Chris?</i>

41:09.340 --> 41:11.440
<i>Sanchez: No, sir.</i>

41:11.442 --> 41:14.477
<i>Barrera: You don't have
to "sir" me in here, Chris.</i>

41:14.479 --> 41:15.845
<i>Sanchez: You're
a lieutenant.</i>

41:15.847 --> 41:18.648
<i>Barrera: "Doctor" is fine.</i>

41:18.650 --> 41:21.717
<i>(Clacking)</i>

41:25.022 --> 41:28.057
<i>Barrera: Oh, that's
just the radiator.</i>

41:30.060 --> 41:33.529
<i>Sanchez: I'm not
much of a talker.</i>

41:38.035 --> 41:41.304
<i>I lost some of my unit.</i>

41:41.306 --> 41:43.873
<i>Barrera: How's
that affecting you?</i>

41:43.875 --> 41:46.242
<i>Sanchez: A lot of dreams.</i>

41:50.581 --> 41:56.152
<i>Problems with jobs...
With... friends.</i>

41:58.021 --> 42:01.691
<i>If you said I was having a total
fucking nervous breakdown,</i>

42:01.693 --> 42:04.026
<i>I wouldn't argue.</i>

42:04.028 --> 42:07.964
<i>Barrera: All of the things
that you're feeling, the rage,</i>

42:07.966 --> 42:15.905
<i>depression, grief, the
guilt, that's normal.</i>

42:17.307 --> 42:20.009
<i>What's abnormal was the
situation you were in:</i>

42:20.011 --> 42:24.880
<i>The trauma, the death in war.</i>

42:24.882 --> 42:30.586
<i>You're having a normal response to
a horribly abnormal situation.</i>

42:30.588 --> 42:32.722
<i>Sanchez: I don't
know about that.</i>

42:32.724 --> 42:34.757
<i>Barrera: You're
feeling helpless.</i>

42:34.759 --> 42:38.127
<i>But we can't go back and affect
your memories unless you start</i>

42:38.129 --> 42:40.196
<i>talking about those events.</i>

42:40.198 --> 42:43.266
<i>(Radiator clacking)</i>

42:47.971 --> 42:50.640
<i>Now, perhaps, you can tell
me a little bit about your</i>

42:50.642 --> 42:54.777
<i>experiences in those
last few weeks.</i>

42:58.682 --> 43:01.717
<i>Sanchez: I led a unit...</i>

43:10.127 --> 43:11.327
<i>(Inhales deeply)</i>

43:11.329 --> 43:16.766
<i>For a mission we should
have never been on.</i>

43:16.768 --> 43:19.835
<i>(Crying quietly)</i>

43:25.175 --> 43:30.212
<i>I mean, the whole fucking
operation was illegal.</i>

43:32.549 --> 43:35.685
<i>Barrera: Go on.</i>

43:37.387 --> 43:40.256
<i>(Crying, sniffling)</i>

43:40.258 --> 43:42.558
<i>Boorman: If Sanchez is
mentally unstable, all the more</i>

43:42.560 --> 43:43.693
<i>reason to be concerned.</i>

43:43.695 --> 43:45.761
<i>Rickson: That's why I sent
him to a psychiatrist.</i>

43:45.763 --> 43:48.664
<i>Boorman: It's that shrink's job
to get the truth out of the</i>

43:48.666 --> 43:52.835
<i>boy, and the truth just
isn't our friend, Howard.</i>

43:52.837 --> 43:56.138
<i>Erickson: There's
patient-doctor privilege.</i>

43:56.140 --> 43:58.140
<i>Boorman: Not good enough.</i>

43:58.142 --> 43:59.642
<i>I'll take care of Sanchez.</i>

43:59.644 --> 44:02.278
<i>Erickson: Fuck you, Jerry!</i>

44:02.280 --> 44:03.479
<i>(Items clattering)</i>

44:03.481 --> 44:05.514
<i>You don't go near my men.</i>

44:05.516 --> 44:06.816
<i>You hear me?</i>

44:06.818 --> 44:07.983
<i>Boorman: Let's be clear.</i>

44:07.985 --> 44:11.954
<i>If anyone finds out about that
last mission, I'm fucked.</i>

44:11.956 --> 44:13.289
<i>And you're out of work.</i>

44:13.291 --> 44:16.425
<i>Erickson: That incident
is all buttoned up.</i>

44:16.427 --> 44:19.695
<i>Boorman: Then how come Chris
Sanchez is chatting up an</i>

44:19.697 --> 44:20.663
<i>attorney?</i>

44:20.665 --> 44:22.665
<i>Erickson: You, you're
worried about a lawsuit?</i>

44:22.667 --> 44:23.933
<i>I know how to handle lawsuits.</i>

44:23.935 --> 44:26.602
<i>Boorman: I'm worried about
what comes out in lawsuits.</i>

44:26.604 --> 44:29.372
<i>I'm worried about what
stories Sanchez might tell.</i>

44:29.374 --> 44:33.542
<i>So we're going to
proceed as I see fit.</i>

44:33.544 --> 44:34.543
<i>Erickson: No.</i>

44:34.545 --> 44:36.679
<i>You're going to
consult me first.</i>

44:36.681 --> 44:38.848
<i>Boorman: Congress is
turning against you, Howard.</i>

44:38.850 --> 44:40.216
<i>You know that.</i>

44:40.218 --> 44:42.218
<i>I'm your lifeline.</i>

44:42.220 --> 44:48.090
<i>I'm the only one who can get your
government contracts renewed.</i>

44:51.695 --> 44:56.832
<i>Erickson: Put the
fucking shoe down!</i>

44:56.834 --> 45:01.737
<i>You don't go near
Sanchez, understood?</i>

45:04.574 --> 45:08.210
<i>Grey: I'm sorry the
little guy fell asleep.</i>

45:08.212 --> 45:13.416
<i>I was hoping these two
could play together.</i>

45:13.418 --> 45:14.917
<i>Hewes: No, it's okay.</i>

45:14.919 --> 45:17.253
<i>Catherine has to have
her lunch, anyway.</i>

45:17.255 --> 45:18.988
<i>Maggie?</i>

45:18.990 --> 45:21.490
<i>Can you get Catherine
her lunch, please?</i>

45:21.492 --> 45:22.491
<i>Maggie: Of course.</i>

45:22.493 --> 45:24.693
<i>Hewes: Maggie's gonna
get you some lunch.</i>

45:24.695 --> 45:27.029
<i>You want blueberry?</i>

45:27.031 --> 45:29.265
<i>Here, take blueberry.</i>

45:32.736 --> 45:35.538
<i>Grey: I thought you
were hiring a new nanny.</i>

45:35.540 --> 45:36.705
<i>Hewes: I did.</i>

45:36.707 --> 45:39.008
<i>It didn't work out.</i>

45:39.010 --> 45:41.177
<i>Grey: How many
does that make now?</i>

45:41.179 --> 45:42.077
<i>Hewes: I don't know.</i>

45:42.079 --> 45:43.579
<i>They all were incompetent.</i>

45:43.581 --> 45:45.448
<i>Grey: You don't
want to tell me?</i>

45:45.450 --> 45:46.449
<i>Hewes: I don't know.</i>

45:46.451 --> 45:47.883
<i>Maybe seven, eight.</i>

45:47.885 --> 45:50.085
<i>Grey: I don't have to
worry about nannies.</i>

45:50.087 --> 45:51.187
<i>I'm a stay-at-home dad.</i>

45:51.189 --> 45:52.721
<i>I love every minute of it.</i>

45:52.723 --> 45:54.423
<i>Hewes: That's
because you're a man.</i>

45:54.425 --> 45:57.059
<i>At your age, you can have a
child and reinvent yourself.</i>

45:57.061 --> 46:01.730
<i>Grey: Mm.</i>

46:01.732 --> 46:04.567
<i>Our pediatrician's wife runs
an art-and-music-based</i>

46:04.569 --> 46:06.101
<i>daycare center.</i>

46:06.103 --> 46:07.903
<i>Hewes: Daycare doesn't
cut it with my schedule.</i>

46:07.905 --> 46:09.572
<i>Grey: So what
are you gonna do?</i>

46:09.574 --> 46:11.440
<i>You're just gonna keep rotating
her through housekeepers</i>

46:11.442 --> 46:12.408
<i>and assistants?</i>

46:12.410 --> 46:14.577
<i>Hewes: Till I find
a good one, yes.</i>

46:14.579 --> 46:17.012
<i>I don't want Catherine to get
attached to someone who</i>

46:17.014 --> 46:18.714
<i>isn't gonna be sticking around.</i>

46:18.716 --> 46:23.419
<i>Grey: Catherine does
have a father, you know.</i>

46:23.421 --> 46:25.621
<i>It's been three years.</i>

46:25.623 --> 46:27.923
<i>Track Michael down.</i>

46:27.925 --> 46:29.291
<i>Hewes: No!</i>

46:29.293 --> 46:30.926
<i>I'm not gonna do that.</i>

46:30.928 --> 46:32.761
<i>Grey: Your son
just disappears.</i>

46:32.763 --> 46:35.164
<i>You're gonna tell me that you
don't want to know where he is?</i>

46:35.166 --> 46:36.932
<i>Hewes: I tried to reach
him in the beginning.</i>

46:36.934 --> 46:39.902
<i>He made it very clear that he
doesn't want me in his life.</i>

46:39.904 --> 46:42.104
<i>Grey: Patty, you gotta
find him, bring him home.</i>

46:42.106 --> 46:44.273
<i>Make him accountable
for his behavior.</i>

46:44.275 --> 46:47.209
<i>Hewes: Michael had a chance
to be a father, and he ran</i>

46:47.211 --> 46:50.112
<i>away from it.</i>

46:50.114 --> 46:52.848
<i>End of story.</i>

47:10.901 --> 47:12.001
<i>Parsons: I'm here, Mrs.</i>

47:12.003 --> 47:14.737
<i>Lowry, because I believe that
High Star may be covering up the</i>

47:14.739 --> 47:17.206
<i>truth about your
husband's death.</i>

47:17.208 --> 47:18.807
Mrs. Lowry: What do you mean?

47:18.809 --> 47:21.677
<i>Parsons: Do you know anything
about the mission your husband</i>

47:21.679 --> 47:24.179
<i>was on in October,
when he was killed?</i>

47:24.181 --> 47:25.614
<i>Mrs. Lowry: Not much.</i>

47:25.616 --> 47:28.684
<i>Tommy was with
High Star since 2005.</i>

47:28.686 --> 47:31.754
<i>But I guess it was about a year
ago that they tapped him for</i>

47:31.756 --> 47:33.155
<i>some new unit.</i>

47:33.157 --> 47:36.025
<i>All I know is that the pay was
better, but the assignment made</i>

47:36.027 --> 47:37.226
<i>him... real nervous.</i>

47:37.228 --> 47:39.662
<i>Parsons: And what was the
explanation they gave you for</i>

47:39.664 --> 47:40.896
<i>their deaths?</i>

47:40.898 --> 47:43.232
<i>Mrs. Lowry: The company was so vague.</i>

47:43.234 --> 47:45.134
<i>Uh, "an ambush," they said.</i>

47:45.136 --> 47:48.704
<i>Parsons: Did your husband ever
talk about the men that he</i>

47:48.706 --> 47:49.705
<i>worked with?</i>

47:49.707 --> 47:51.040
<i>Mrs. Lowry: Yeah, nonstop.</i>

47:51.042 --> 47:53.809
<i>I mean, I heard all
kinds of stories.</i>

47:53.811 --> 47:55.177
<i>You want to see a picture?</i>

47:55.179 --> 47:56.178
<i>Parsons: Yes, please.</i>

47:56.180 --> 47:58.247
<i>That would be great.</i>

48:02.185 --> 48:05.321
<i>Mrs. Lowry: This is his unit.</i>

48:05.323 --> 48:08.991
<i>Look at them, just smiling.</i>

48:08.993 --> 48:13.162
<i>That's Tommy on the left.</i>

48:13.164 --> 48:15.564

48:15.566 --> 48:16.732
<i>(Mrs. Lowry laughs)</i>

48:16.734 --> 48:19.034
<i>Jay could sometimes be a dick,
but he made Tommy laugh.</i>

48:19.036 --> 48:20.035
<i>(Parsons laughs)</i>

48:20.037 --> 48:25.040
<i>And the real tall one--
That's Bob Franks.</i>

48:25.042 --> 48:28.043
<i>Franko and Jayray both
passed same day as Tommy.</i>

48:28.045 --> 48:29.244

48:29.246 --> 48:30.512
<i>Lowry.</i>

48:30.514 --> 48:33.983
<i>Mrs. Lowry: And you see that guy?</i>

48:36.620 --> 48:39.021
<i>That's Chris Sanchez.</i>

48:39.023 --> 48:42.024
<i>You know how some guys are
just naturally built to lead?</i>

48:42.026 --> 48:45.361
