00:00.475 --> 00:02.043
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.043 --> 00:03.917
My foster father caught my little brother

00:03.917 --> 00:05.552
wearing one of his ex-wife's dresses.

00:05.552 --> 00:07.454
Started beating the crap out of him.

00:07.454 --> 00:09.389
Foster siblings are not allowed to...

00:09.389 --> 00:11.991
- Hook up?
- There's nothing going on between Callie and I.

00:11.991 --> 00:13.059
You look nice.

00:13.059 --> 00:14.561
What do you want from me?

00:14.561 --> 00:17.030
Stimulating conversation... and sex.

00:17.964 --> 00:18.998
You could have any girl you wanted.

00:18.998 --> 00:20.467
Why'd it have to be my best friend?

00:20.467 --> 00:22.369
- You read her journal?
- Yes. Just listen to me...

00:22.369 --> 00:24.571
I can't do this anymore! I'm done.

00:24.571 --> 00:26.906
- She told you.
- She didn't tell me what it said.

00:26.906 --> 00:29.609
I already know everything
I need to know about you.

00:29.609 --> 00:31.077
Callie, wait.

00:36.249 --> 00:38.318
- Oh, my God.
- What?

00:38.318 --> 00:40.920
I meant to pick up some guacamole
from that place you love.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.256
Oh, that stuff's so good, too.

00:43.256 --> 00:47.227
Sorry, Mariana called, then Jude
needed me, and I just... forgot.

00:47.227 --> 00:49.195
Remember when you used to love me?

00:49.195 --> 00:50.930
Don't do that. I feel terrible.

00:50.930 --> 00:53.933
I guess, just salsa will be fine...

00:56.403 --> 00:58.872
Hey, where do you think
you're going, young man?

00:58.872 --> 01:01.040
Can't we just go up and play video games?

01:01.040 --> 01:01.933
No, no. You know the rules.

01:01.935 --> 01:04.416
No girls allowed in your bedroom
unless one of us is upstairs.

01:04.416 --> 01:06.251
So, we're just supposed to stay here,

01:06.251 --> 01:08.887
hang out with your lame
old friends all night?

01:08.887 --> 01:10.822
Sandra just spent 20 minutes telling us

01:10.822 --> 01:13.291
how she installed her own
toilet. That's not fair.

01:13.256 --> 01:16.326
No, what's not fair is when
I make you start cleaning up

01:16.326 --> 01:17.861
all the dirty plates around the house,

01:17.861 --> 01:20.230
because you just called
our friends lame and old.

01:20.230 --> 01:23.032
Knock yourself out.

01:23.032 --> 01:25.594
- Taking out the trash?
- Hey, enough. Go, go, go.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.071
Lexi, you can help, please.

01:28.071 --> 01:29.806
Why does she have to be here?

01:29.806 --> 01:33.309
She is your brother's girlfriend.

01:33.309 --> 01:36.813
Look, I know that this has got
to be hard for you right now,

01:36.813 --> 01:40.283
- but she's your best friend.
- Not anymore.

01:40.283 --> 01:43.386
Just like families,
sometimes friends fight.

01:43.386 --> 01:44.954
And lie to your face?

01:44.954 --> 01:48.291
And they still love you no matter what.

01:48.291 --> 01:52.162
Yeah, well... if that's
love, I don't want it.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.970
- Mariana!
- Oh, my God, Garret!

02:00.970 --> 02:03.440
- Mariana, you look beautiful.
- Where are your mothers?

02:03.440 --> 02:04.874
Kitchen.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.913
Wow, you look... different.

02:10.913 --> 02:14.784
Puberty. Turns out the rumor's
true. It really does change things.

02:14.784 --> 02:18.221
That's what happens when we
don't see each other for a year.

02:17.986 --> 02:21.823
What's happening with you? Tell
me everything. Max detail. Go.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.597
Thank you for bringing the casserole.

02:28.597 --> 02:30.699
- Vegetarian?
- Vegan.

02:30.699 --> 02:32.601
We can barely get food on
the table three times a day.

02:32.601 --> 02:34.936
I don't know how you guys
find time to be so healthy.

02:34.936 --> 02:38.940
I don't do it. All credit
to the chef in the family.

02:38.940 --> 02:42.644
- Where's Stef?
- She's out back, womaning the grill.

02:43.783 --> 02:47.587
That's the nicest thing she's said
to me in I don't know how long.

02:47.587 --> 02:50.156
We're going through a rough patch.

02:50.156 --> 02:54.627
- We all go through those.
- Yeah, did they usually last two years?

02:54.627 --> 02:56.529
Is everything ok?

02:58.531 --> 03:00.667
We're talking about splitting up.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.902
What?

03:02.902 --> 03:07.674
No, that's impossible. You can't
do that, you're Kelly and Jenna.

03:07.674 --> 03:09.209
I know.

03:09.209 --> 03:12.212
After 20 years, you start
thinking it's really forever,

03:12.212 --> 03:14.581
that nothing can pull you apart.

03:14.581 --> 03:18.151
- So, what changed?
- I don't know.

03:19.652 --> 03:23.323
We did, I guess. You know how it is,

03:23.323 --> 03:26.259
you're so focused on kids,
work, and paying the bills,

03:26.259 --> 03:28.528
that you stop paying
attention to each other.

03:28.528 --> 03:32.398
All the things you used to do for
each other, the little stuff...

03:32.398 --> 03:35.268
one day, you start
forgetting to do those things,

03:35.268 --> 03:39.138
and you think, "It doesn't matter."

03:39.138 --> 03:40.707
Then the next day,

03:40.707 --> 03:44.177
you stop caring that you
forgot in the first place.

03:44.177 --> 03:48.177
And before long, you realize all
you have in common is the routine.

03:55.688 --> 03:59.192
And since I've been obsessed
with Ferlinghetti for a year,

03:59.192 --> 04:00.760
I decided to try poetry.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.130
So, I'm writing a piece
for a poetry slam this week.

04:04.130 --> 04:06.165
What's a poetry slam?

04:06.165 --> 04:10.165
It's sort of like a concert,
but with poems instead of songs.

04:11.137 --> 04:13.640
Think hip-hop meets the Beat poets.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.642
You know, Ginsberg and Kerouac.

04:15.642 --> 04:18.177
Oh, yeah, I totally love them.

04:18.177 --> 04:21.581
The art house in Hillcrest
is playing On the Road.

04:21.581 --> 04:25.385
From the novel. You know, by Kerouac.

04:26.452 --> 04:27.887
Oh, right.

04:28.888 --> 04:32.425
- You want to check it out with me?
- Ok.

04:33.236 --> 04:34.604
Having fun?

04:34.604 --> 04:36.606
It's kind of a weird party.

04:36.606 --> 04:39.442
Yeah, my moms have a lot of weird friends.

04:39.442 --> 04:42.245
- I mean, everybody's nice.
- Hey.

04:45.148 --> 04:46.683
Hey, what's he doing here?

04:46.683 --> 04:48.518
I invited him.

04:49.319 --> 04:51.554
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:51.554 --> 04:54.524
Wow, this is quite the rager.

04:54.524 --> 04:56.259
Lighten up, dude. I'm kidding.

04:56.259 --> 04:58.661
Yeah, I know. Just don't call me dude.

04:58.236 --> 05:00.272
Did you get enough to eat, Jude?

05:00.272 --> 05:02.040
Yeah.

05:05.544 --> 05:09.114
Ok, see this is a dry dish.

05:09.114 --> 05:12.250
- And this is me not caring.
- Watch your mouth, young man.

05:12.250 --> 05:14.820
What? If you like how he
does it so much better,

05:14.820 --> 05:17.155
he can come over every night and do it.

05:17.155 --> 05:21.993
So, Jenna told me that Garret
is doing some poetry slam.

05:21.993 --> 05:24.096
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:24.096 --> 05:25.997
I was thinking, maybe we could all go

05:25.847 --> 05:27.649
if he makes it to performance round.

05:27.649 --> 05:31.053
It'd be a nice break from
volleyball and television...

05:31.053 --> 05:32.654
Might even learn something.

05:32.654 --> 05:35.023
- I'm in.
- Ooh, learning. Cool.

05:35.023 --> 05:37.993
- Wow.
- I'll go.

05:37.993 --> 05:40.028
Not your thing?

05:40.028 --> 05:43.665
No, no, just... yeah, it's not my thing.

05:43.665 --> 05:46.802
Well, it's your choice, but
we'd love to have you join us.

05:46.802 --> 05:50.505
If it's ok, I think I'm just gonna pass.

05:50.505 --> 05:53.141
Ok, manual labor's done.

05:53.141 --> 05:55.811
I got to get home. Thank
you, guys, for a fun night.

05:55.811 --> 05:57.980
- Thank you for helping us.
- Very nice to meet you, Wyatt.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.481
- Pleasure.
- Ok.

06:01.583 --> 06:05.387
- Yeah, nice to meet you, Wyatt.
- You, too, big guy. See you.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.622
All right.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.091
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

07:00.562 --> 07:02.564
Hey, what are you doing with that guy?

07:02.564 --> 07:05.067
That guy is the only
person I've met at school

07:05.067 --> 07:06.635
who isn't completely freaked out by me.

07:06.635 --> 07:10.205
Just be careful with him.

07:11.206 --> 07:13.609
What's that supposed to mean?

07:13.609 --> 07:17.546
- He used to date Talya.
- So?

07:17.546 --> 07:19.682
It's not that. I mean...

07:19.682 --> 07:21.984
Ok, he was really into her for awhile,

07:21.984 --> 07:23.485
then he convinced her to have sex with him.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.121
- Yeah?
- And then he dumped her.

07:26.121 --> 07:30.121
The next day. Just trust
me, he's not a good guy.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.032
Isn't it Jesus's week to help with laundry?

07:37.032 --> 07:39.034
Yeah, I told him not to bother.

07:38.939 --> 07:41.008
The last time he did
it my white linen pants

07:41.008 --> 07:42.543
came out of the dryer as pink capris.

07:42.543 --> 07:44.578
Yeah.

07:48.015 --> 07:50.417
So, Jenna told me that she
and Kelly may be splitting up.

07:50.417 --> 07:53.220
What? No way. What? You're kidding.

07:53.220 --> 07:56.924
I know. Jenna said they
haven't had sex in over a year.

07:58.225 --> 07:59.593
Oh, dear.

07:59.593 --> 08:03.230
That is a long time to let it go, isn't it.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.398
How long has it been for us?

08:04.398 --> 08:08.102
Uh, it was last...

08:08.102 --> 08:10.170
If you have to think about
it, it's been too long.

08:10.170 --> 08:12.406
Sweetheart, what do you expect?

08:12.406 --> 08:15.442
We have jobs, five kids,
and no cleaning person.

08:15.442 --> 08:17.945
Can't expect things to be
the way they used to be.

08:17.945 --> 08:20.114
They shouldn't be this different.

08:20.114 --> 08:23.284
Let's have a date night.
You know, like we used to.

08:23.284 --> 08:27.284
With cocktails, and dinner,
and then other stuff...

08:28.455 --> 08:31.225
Mm-hm. You think we
have time for all that?

08:31.225 --> 08:33.065
- How about just the "other stuff" part?
- I can handle that.

08:33.065 --> 08:35.200
Let me check my phone.

08:37.001 --> 08:39.071
Let's see.

08:38.881 --> 08:39.852
- Tomorrow's not great.
- Why?

08:39.883 --> 08:41.485
Jude has his tutor and you have to take

08:41.485 --> 08:42.753
Brandon to his dentist appointment.

08:42.753 --> 08:44.554
No, I thought you were taking Brandon.

08:44.554 --> 08:46.690
No, I can't. I have to talk to
the tutor about Jude's mid-terms.

08:46.690 --> 08:49.059
Ok, how about this? How about...

08:49.059 --> 08:52.529
You leave work early, I will take a
late lunch. The house will be empty.

08:52.529 --> 08:54.798
And there will be no kids to worry about.

08:54.798 --> 08:57.634
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

08:57.634 --> 09:01.634
Do we have any antacids? Your
chimichangas are killing me...

09:07.577 --> 09:09.479
What time are your parents coming home?

09:09.479 --> 09:10.847
Not for hours.

09:13.884 --> 09:16.987
- Are you ok?
- I'm great, I just...

09:16.987 --> 09:18.789
Just need a little break.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.724
We don't have to stop.

09:20.724 --> 09:22.626
Really?

09:41.410 --> 09:42.745
I like that color.

09:42.745 --> 09:44.513
Are you sure it's not too much?

09:44.513 --> 09:47.650
I'm going for the "I'm being
carelessly casual but just happen

09:47.650 --> 09:49.752
to be fabulous" look for my date tonight.

09:49.752 --> 09:51.086
It's pretty.

09:51.086 --> 09:53.556
Do you want me to do yours?

09:53.556 --> 09:56.659
- Come on, let me do yours too.
- Ok.

09:59.528 --> 10:03.165
So, anything new and
exciting in your world?

10:03.165 --> 10:05.534
Made any new friends?

10:05.534 --> 10:08.370
Well, there is this one boy.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.306
- Oh?
- His name is Connor,

10:10.306 --> 10:12.107
and we have math class together.

10:12.107 --> 10:15.211
- What's he like?
- I don't know. He's pretty cool.

10:21.217 --> 10:23.786
Uh, don't wear that to school. Ok, buddy?

10:27.189 --> 10:30.826
You don't have to do
everything she says, you know...

10:36.565 --> 10:38.767
What happened with you and Talya?

10:40.256 --> 10:43.125
My night was great.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.428
And yes, this is a new
shirt, thanks for noticing.

10:45.428 --> 10:48.931
- It does bring out my eyes.
- Everything's not a joke.

10:48.931 --> 10:51.567
Ok, wow, you're going
for this direct thing.

10:51.567 --> 10:55.204
This is Brandon, right? He told you this?

10:56.422 --> 10:58.825
Talya and I,

10:58.825 --> 11:01.060
we hung out, she seemed chill,

11:01.060 --> 11:04.097
I liked her, and we had sex.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.800
And that's supposed to make you,
what exactly? Feel like a real man?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.970
You wanted to know what happened.
I'm just giving you the full story.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.473
As soon as we did it, she changed.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.075
She got all weird and controlling.

11:16.075 --> 11:19.112
In case you haven't noticed,
that's not really my thing.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.482
So, after a couple weeks, I let
her know I wasn't into it anymore.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.951
So, you didn't break up
with her the next day?

11:24.951 --> 11:28.755
I did not. Everyone thinks
she's one of those nice girls,

11:28.755 --> 11:30.056
she's actually kind of crazy.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.993
Ah... sorry.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.629
Apology not accepted.

11:37.630 --> 11:38.932
What?

11:38.552 --> 11:40.453
If you think you can just attack me...

11:40.453 --> 11:43.423
- Wasn't an attack.
- ... and say you're sorry and it's all better?

11:43.423 --> 11:47.060
Mm-mm. I'm not some pushover who
takes a hit and comes back for more.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.995
You're going to have to make it up to me.

11:48.995 --> 11:51.364
Tomorrow night.

11:51.364 --> 11:53.066
And do what?

11:53.066 --> 11:55.268
I don't know yet.

11:55.268 --> 11:58.004
Well, I'll have to ask Lena and Stef.

11:58.004 --> 11:59.606
They'll say yes.

11:59.606 --> 12:01.408
So, you're confident.

12:01.408 --> 12:04.978
Well, I didn't stick
around and dry their dishes

12:04.978 --> 12:08.114
just because I like cleaning
up after other people.

12:08.114 --> 12:10.317
See you tomorrow.

12:11.952 --> 12:13.653
It was not.

12:13.463 --> 12:16.433
I swear, it was a 55-pound white seabass.

12:16.433 --> 12:18.902
My dad weighed it. It was crazy big.

12:18.902 --> 12:21.872
- You fish?
- I've never even been on a boat.

12:21.872 --> 12:24.341
How do you grow up by the
beach but never get on a boat?

12:24.341 --> 12:25.909
You have to come next
time my dad takes me out.

12:25.909 --> 12:28.779
- Really?
- Wait, I forgot my book.

12:30.914 --> 12:33.483
- Nice nails.
- You wearing a bra, too?

12:33.483 --> 12:35.318
Why don't you guys just grow up?

12:35.318 --> 12:37.387
What'd you just say?

12:40.857 --> 12:43.994
I said grow up, idiot.

12:43.994 --> 12:47.164
- Who're you calling an idiot?
- What's going on here?

12:47.164 --> 12:50.333
Blake, Jeremy. Principal's office. Now.

13:00.444 --> 13:02.879
Hey. Brought you something.

13:04.414 --> 13:07.017
They had the good ones
in the cafeteria today.

13:07.017 --> 13:09.486
I know you like them, so...

13:09.486 --> 13:11.488
Thanks.

13:11.488 --> 13:14.091
Are you ok?

13:14.091 --> 13:16.426
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:16.426 --> 13:18.328
You sure?

13:18.328 --> 13:20.397
What if I get pregnant?

13:20.397 --> 13:22.299
- That's not going to happen.
- You don't know that.

13:22.299 --> 13:24.234
My parents...

13:24.234 --> 13:26.303
my parents would kill me.

13:39.316 --> 13:43.019
Yes, I need a morning-after pill, please.

13:48.191 --> 13:49.426
Thanks.

13:50.994 --> 13:53.263
Hi. I'm picking up for
my son, Jesus Foster.

13:53.263 --> 13:55.198
And this, please.

13:59.369 --> 14:01.338
Hey!

14:01.338 --> 14:03.807
What is going on?

14:10.483 --> 14:14.020
- Lena?
- Upstairs!

14:14.020 --> 14:16.956
Uh, I am here with Jesus.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.625
Could you come down for a minute, please?

14:18.625 --> 14:20.159
Why is Mom home so early?

14:20.159 --> 14:23.396
You are not in a position
to be asking questions.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.265
Hey, what's going on?

14:27.267 --> 14:30.003
Last night, I...

14:33.439 --> 14:36.209
last night, Lexi and I had sex.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.612
Oh, my God.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.447
Ok...

14:42.615 --> 14:44.384
And?

14:45.518 --> 14:48.955
And we didn't use protection.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.958
How many times have we talked about this?

14:51.958 --> 14:55.094
I know, but it... just sort of happened.

14:54.914 --> 14:56.349
And then it was too late.

14:56.349 --> 14:59.219
Well, we needed the morning-after pill,

14:59.219 --> 15:01.788
but I guess you have to have ID to buy it.

15:01.788 --> 15:04.724
Neither of us have ID, so...

15:04.724 --> 15:08.328
I asked some lady at the
pharmacy to get the pill for us.

15:08.328 --> 15:10.797
And that's when Mom found me.

15:10.407 --> 15:12.843
Jesus, how many ways do we
have to tell you to come to us?

15:12.843 --> 15:14.845
Why didn't you come to us?

15:14.845 --> 15:16.747
To avoid this.

15:19.015 --> 15:20.917
I don't know what to say.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.853
So, can I give it to her?

15:22.853 --> 15:26.890
Your mom and I need to talk about
this. Please go to your room.

15:33.330 --> 15:37.501
I know it was stupid, but Lexi
thought it was the only thing to do.

15:37.501 --> 15:42.038
- Why?
- She's afraid her parents are going to find out and freak.

15:49.613 --> 15:51.982
We did everything we were supposed to do...

15:51.982 --> 15:54.584
open dialogue, no stigmatizing,

15:54.434 --> 15:57.771
no fear based warnings. We even
put condoms in their bathroom.

15:57.771 --> 15:59.239
We can't blame ourselves, honey.

15:59.239 --> 16:01.642
I know, I know. I'm just...

16:01.642 --> 16:04.611
- Really disappointed.
- I know.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.747
So, now what?

16:08.445 --> 16:11.982
- We give her the pill.
- What about her parents?

16:11.982 --> 16:14.151
What about her parents.

16:14.151 --> 16:15.686
If this were Mariana,
we would want to know.

16:15.686 --> 16:17.588
We can't go making decisions
for other people's kids.

16:17.588 --> 16:21.091
Ok, what if she gets pregnant, Lena?

16:21.091 --> 16:24.461
You know how religious her parents are.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.630
They're certainly not
going to let her terminate.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.042
They're going to want them to get married.

16:28.042 --> 16:30.778
Do you want Jesus to be
married and a father at 15?

16:30.778 --> 16:33.214
Please quit reminding me that they're 15.

16:33.214 --> 16:37.218
- Well, they are.
- There's always adoption.

16:37.218 --> 16:39.353
I... do you really want
them to go through that?

16:39.353 --> 16:42.756
- 'Cause I got to tell you...
- I have a responsibility here.

16:42.756 --> 16:45.159
I am her vice principal.

16:46.127 --> 16:47.928
And I am not.

16:47.928 --> 16:50.131
Can we just take a beat, please?

16:50.131 --> 16:52.133
This is not the kind of thing we act on

16:52.133 --> 16:54.835
without thinking it through first.

16:54.835 --> 16:57.104
I'm going to go get dressed.

17:01.459 --> 17:03.060
You didn't like it, did you.

17:03.060 --> 17:04.996
Of course, I liked it.

17:04.996 --> 17:06.931
On the Road is like a classic.

17:06.931 --> 17:08.933
It's just... I don't know,

17:08.933 --> 17:11.435
I feel like everyone was kind of selfish,

17:11.435 --> 17:14.739
and just angry and didn't
care about anyone else.

17:14.739 --> 17:16.874
They had a lot to be angry about.

17:16.874 --> 17:17.974
They were looking for answers and

17:17.974 --> 17:19.810
no one else was even asking the questions.

17:19.810 --> 17:23.146
Ok, I guess I didn't like it.

17:23.146 --> 17:26.884
Maybe next time we can
go see The Lone Ranger.

17:26.884 --> 17:28.421
So, you want to come inside?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.952
We can, I don't know,
watch TV or something.

17:31.088 --> 17:33.591
TV's not really my thing.

17:33.411 --> 17:34.846
Besides, I got to meet up with a friend.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.781
I promised I'd help her rehearse a poem

17:36.781 --> 17:38.950
for the first round of the Slam tomorrow.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.018
The second round's
supposed to be a big to-do.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.020
But, thanks for a fun time.

17:43.921 --> 17:46.924
- Yeah, sure.
- See you later.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.293
No, I'm serious.

17:49.293 --> 17:51.863
It's like he didn't
even know it was a date.

17:51.863 --> 17:55.032
Maybe he didn't. Why do you care anyway?

17:55.032 --> 17:57.668
Well, we're not all as lucky as you.

17:57.668 --> 17:59.804
You just got here, you don't even try,

17:59.804 --> 18:01.772
and you already have a boyfriend.

18:01.772 --> 18:04.609
Wyatt, not a boyfriend.

18:05.106 --> 18:07.008
He sure seems like a boyfriend.

18:07.008 --> 18:08.309
Look, if Garret wants to hang out

18:08.309 --> 18:11.646
with some alternative
poetry girls, let him.

18:11.646 --> 18:13.481
Besides, do you really want to date a guy

18:13.481 --> 18:15.517
whose pants are tighter than yours?

18:16.885 --> 18:19.187
They were kind of tight, huh?

18:24.592 --> 18:26.227
How're you holding up?

18:26.227 --> 18:28.329
I'm fine.

18:33.034 --> 18:35.670
Do you want to talk about anything?

18:35.670 --> 18:37.272
What's going on?

18:37.272 --> 18:40.308
Jude just had a rough day yesterday.

18:40.308 --> 18:42.343
Some of the kids were
giving him a hard time.

18:42.343 --> 18:44.479
What happened? Are you ok?

18:44.479 --> 18:48.249
He's fine. But, a couple of the
guys noticed his nail polish...

18:48.249 --> 18:50.451
I told you not to go to
school with it on, Jude.

18:50.451 --> 18:53.054
Go take it off. Now.

18:53.054 --> 18:55.890
Stop telling me what to do.

19:00.094 --> 19:01.996
Callie, Jude's a special kid.

19:01.996 --> 19:04.065
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, Lena,

19:03.885 --> 19:06.221
but what makes him
special, gets him beat up.

19:07.255 --> 19:09.157
Well, he's safe in this house.

19:09.157 --> 19:13.094
And thank you for that, really,

19:14.362 --> 19:16.264
but we're not staying here.

19:15.974 --> 19:20.112
I don't want him to start
thinking the world is like this,

19:20.112 --> 19:24.015
and then we move, and
then he gets even more hurt

19:24.015 --> 19:26.785
when he figures out that it's not.

19:38.864 --> 19:41.700
- Hey. Hello.
- Hey, Wyatt.

19:41.510 --> 19:42.911
Oh, wait, before you go.

19:44.713 --> 19:46.782
It's an old one of Stef's.
We want you to have it.

19:46.782 --> 19:49.818
You're on the family plan now.

19:49.818 --> 19:53.689
- Thanks.
- So, 10 o'clock, and not a second later.

19:53.689 --> 19:55.624
- Got it?
- Got it.

19:55.624 --> 19:57.793
Oh, I'm glad to hear that,
but I wasn't talking to you.

19:57.793 --> 19:59.528
Ten o'clock.

20:00.429 --> 20:01.663
Yeah.

20:06.735 --> 20:08.437
Where's she going?

20:08.437 --> 20:10.572
On a date with Wyatt.

20:10.572 --> 20:12.407
What about you? You got any plans?

20:12.407 --> 20:15.377
Um... no.

20:31.693 --> 20:34.629
So, when do I get to know
what we're actually doing here?

20:34.629 --> 20:36.365
Wait and see.

20:37.766 --> 20:39.368
Come on.

20:41.536 --> 20:43.638
You have a beach house?

20:43.638 --> 20:46.608
My parents do. Pretty much never use it.

20:46.608 --> 20:49.644
Ok, what are we doing here?

20:49.644 --> 20:51.346
You hear about that meteor shower tonight?

20:51.346 --> 20:52.614
What about it?

20:54.583 --> 20:58.420
Front row seats. Come on.

20:58.420 --> 20:59.855
The sun's about to set.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.862
May I?

21:15.537 --> 21:17.672
You know, just a little
dab will do the trick.

21:17.672 --> 21:19.541
Do you mind?

21:22.244 --> 21:23.512
Ok.

21:33.989 --> 21:36.591
When Stef and I are at home,

21:37.392 --> 21:39.594
we hold hands and kiss...

21:39.594 --> 21:41.530
Really?

21:41.530 --> 21:44.566
Well, we used to do it a lot more often,

21:44.566 --> 21:46.701
but we've just been really busy lately.

21:46.701 --> 21:49.538
What does being busy have
to do with holding hands?

21:49.538 --> 21:52.007
Ok, we're getting a little off-track here.

21:52.251 --> 21:54.253
My point is,

21:54.253 --> 21:57.790
sometimes when we're
out in a new neighborhood

21:57.790 --> 22:01.790
or walking home late to our
car, we won't hold hands.

22:02.561 --> 22:04.196
Why?

22:05.197 --> 22:07.633
Some people out there

22:07.633 --> 22:11.103
are afraid of what's different,

22:11.103 --> 22:13.739
and sometimes they want to
hurt people like Stef and me.

22:13.739 --> 22:17.877
So, every time we're out and
I want to hold Stef's hand,

22:17.877 --> 22:19.211
but I decide not to?

22:19.211 --> 22:21.747
I get mad.

22:21.747 --> 22:24.491
I'm mad at the people
who might want to hurt us,

22:24.491 --> 22:28.762
but mad at myself, too,
for not standing up to them.

22:29.450 --> 22:31.185
'Cause the thing is,

22:31.185 --> 22:34.288
if you're taught to hide
what makes you different,

22:34.288 --> 22:38.125
you can end up feeling a lot
of shame about who you are,

22:38.125 --> 22:41.896
and that's not ok.

22:41.696 --> 22:45.696
There's nothing wrong with
you for wearing nail polish,

22:46.801 --> 22:50.801
just like there's nothing wrong
with me for holding Stef's hand.

22:51.416 --> 22:55.416
What's wrong is the people out
there who make us feel unsafe.

23:03.995 --> 23:05.697
It's beautiful.

23:07.475 --> 23:09.377
You mean that dense layer of clouds

23:09.377 --> 23:11.479
that's keeping us from seeing anything

23:11.479 --> 23:13.681
or the loud plane that keeps flying over?

23:15.984 --> 23:18.586
- Well, you tried.
- I tried.

23:18.586 --> 23:20.488
Valiant effort.

23:23.458 --> 23:24.826
You have an eye booger.

23:26.327 --> 23:28.296
Oh, my God... seriously?

23:28.296 --> 23:31.366
No, I'm just making it up to
make you feel good about yourself.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.801
- Other side.
- All right...

23:35.236 --> 23:36.838
It's still there, you just moved it.

23:36.838 --> 23:38.873
- Ok.
- I'll get it.

23:52.453 --> 23:54.589
I thought you said your
parents never use the house.

23:54.589 --> 23:56.991
Yeah, this isn't my house. We got to go.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.242
What the hell was that?

24:02.242 --> 24:04.978
I did a construction job
at that house last summer.

24:04.978 --> 24:06.980
I really thought they only
used the place on weekends.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.515
Are you freakin' kidding me?

24:08.515 --> 24:10.551
I'm on probation! You understand
what could have happened

24:10.551 --> 24:14.221
- if they caught us?
- I'm sorry...

24:14.221 --> 24:16.089
I was just trying to impress you.

24:16.089 --> 24:17.891
Well, congratulations.

24:17.891 --> 24:21.261
I'm blown away by your utter lack
of regard for anyone but yourself.

24:24.131 --> 24:25.399
I have to be home in a half hour.

24:29.369 --> 24:32.973
Good luck getting through the
police barricade to get to my car.

24:35.242 --> 24:37.144
It's too soon?

25:01.201 --> 25:03.103
Hey.

25:03.103 --> 25:06.240
And wisps of dirty hair
cling to your angry face

25:06.240 --> 25:09.843
There is a tiny bit of mustard
burrowed in the crack of your frown

25:09.843 --> 25:13.213
And this is when I know
And this is when it changes

25:13.213 --> 25:15.449
And this is the way I will remember you

25:18.085 --> 25:21.889
You seriously did great.
Like, Andrea Gibson great.

25:21.889 --> 25:23.323
I couldn't have done it without you.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.229
Hey, what are you doing here?

25:29.229 --> 25:33.333
Um, I'm performing.
You kind of inspired me.

25:33.333 --> 25:36.603
Oh, ok. That's great.

25:37.871 --> 25:40.207
I'm sorry. Mariana, this is Savannah.

25:40.207 --> 25:43.243
Savannah, this is Mariana.
She's a friend of my family.

25:45.379 --> 25:48.916
I like your outfit, and
your poem was really cool.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.884
Oh. Thanks.

25:58.525 --> 26:00.994
Mom.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.430
I'm guessing you're not here
for a little mother-son time?

26:03.430 --> 26:06.133
Did you guys decide about the pill yet?

26:09.169 --> 26:11.104
We're still thinking, Jesus.

26:11.104 --> 26:14.308
Ok, but, Lexi's kind of
freaking out, because...

26:14.308 --> 26:17.411
Well, it's called the morning-after
pill for a reason, you know?

26:17.411 --> 26:19.246
Yes. I know.

26:21.291 --> 26:24.294
This is one of those things
we'll laugh about tomorrow.

26:24.294 --> 26:26.330
It's unlikely.

26:36.106 --> 26:37.598
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

26:37.612 --> 26:38.980
Thanks for bailing us out, bro.

26:38.989 --> 26:40.358
I'm not your bro.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.950
Blooming like a rose in spring

26:45.950 --> 26:48.686
Blossoming like an Easter lily

26:48.686 --> 26:52.686
Your smile is a flower on
the garden of your face.

26:53.991 --> 26:56.660
Woo!

26:59.530 --> 27:01.665
That was really nice.

27:01.665 --> 27:05.069
- Thanks.
- All right.

27:05.069 --> 27:06.770
Thank you so very much for coming.

27:06.770 --> 27:09.607
We're impressed. So, for
tomorrow's round-two performance,

27:09.607 --> 27:10.975
we'd like to use...

27:10.975 --> 27:13.944
Matt DeVry, Alice Lewis,

27:13.944 --> 27:17.944
Gabriella DuPont, Savannah
George, and Mo Peters...

27:18.916 --> 27:22.386
and closing the night
out will be Garret Paul.

27:22.386 --> 27:23.788
Let's give all the performers a hand.

27:23.788 --> 27:25.890
Thanks for coming out.

27:26.925 --> 27:29.894
- Sorry.
- It's cool.

27:29.894 --> 27:32.063
Closing the show, huh? Nice.

27:33.998 --> 27:36.000
Excuse me. Hi...

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
I was just wondering if you could
tell me why I didn't make it?

27:40.238 --> 27:42.907
You know, so I can be better
prepared for next time.

27:42.907 --> 27:44.208
This is your first performance, right?

27:45.944 --> 27:48.947
You did an amazing job, really.

27:48.947 --> 27:51.149
We're just looking for something different.

27:51.149 --> 27:55.186
A little more raw, you
know? But you'll get there.

28:12.737 --> 28:15.373
- Hey, I said I was sorry.
- And I said it was ok.

28:15.373 --> 28:18.476
- Why are you acting so mad?
- You really have to ask?

28:18.476 --> 28:21.279
You just had me pick you
up on a date with Wyatt!

28:21.279 --> 28:22.914
Why do you hate Wyatt so much?

28:22.914 --> 28:25.350
This isn't even about Wyatt.

28:25.350 --> 28:28.052
Ok?

28:28.052 --> 28:29.854
I don't want you dating Wyatt

28:29.854 --> 28:33.257
because I don't want you dating anyone.

28:37.929 --> 28:40.898
I can't...

28:40.898 --> 28:43.968
- I can't do this.
- Well, too bad.

28:43.778 --> 28:45.580
Even having this conversation could

28:45.580 --> 28:46.981
get me and Jude kicked out of the house.

28:46.981 --> 28:49.751
- That would never happen.
- You don't know that.

28:50.885 --> 28:53.822
Two years ago, Jude and I were
in a really good foster home.

28:53.822 --> 28:56.725
Definitely the best before coming here.

28:57.892 --> 28:59.861
And they had a son.

28:59.861 --> 29:02.430
And he was really nice to me.
So, we started hanging out.

29:02.430 --> 29:04.799
And then the parents found out.

29:04.799 --> 29:08.036
And he told them it was my fault,

29:08.036 --> 29:10.939
I was coming on to him.

29:10.939 --> 29:13.441
And the next day,

29:13.441 --> 29:16.811
the next day, they had
me and Jude sent away.

29:18.580 --> 29:20.715
And the parents told CPS some excuse.

29:20.575 --> 29:23.512
They didn't want to admit
that their son was having

29:23.512 --> 29:25.814
a relationship with the trashy foster girl.

29:25.814 --> 29:29.951
So, yeah, Brandon. It can happen...

29:31.219 --> 29:32.654
because it already did.

29:33.822 --> 29:37.993
I'm not like him. I would never do that.

29:40.295 --> 29:44.295
It doesn't matter. It
still ends the same way.

30:00.187 --> 30:04.091
Admit it, you want me to apologize.

30:04.091 --> 30:06.894
I don't, because it doesn't matter.

30:06.894 --> 30:10.464
No, you do want me to
apologize so you can forgive me

30:10.464 --> 30:14.335
and everything can go back
to normal because you like me.

30:14.335 --> 30:18.439
So I like you because you're
reckless and presumptuous?

30:18.439 --> 30:20.341
That's interesting.

30:20.341 --> 30:22.876
You're not as good of a
liar as you think you are.

30:22.876 --> 30:26.547
Look, I've done a lot of
stupid things in my life,

30:26.547 --> 30:30.384
I haven't regretted any
of it, until last night.

30:30.384 --> 30:32.119
I should not have done what I did.

30:32.119 --> 30:34.655
I regret it. And I'm sorry.

30:37.558 --> 30:41.558
So, how long are you going
to leave me hanging here?

30:42.463 --> 30:44.365
We good?

30:47.368 --> 30:49.858
Come on, it's not like
I'm asking you to marry me.

30:49.858 --> 30:53.858
Just give me another chance, all right?

31:07.102 --> 31:08.258
You ok?

31:08.511 --> 31:10.713
These lips take a while to process, I know.

31:10.713 --> 31:12.081
I'm fine.

31:54.624 --> 31:56.626
Are you sure you're ok?

31:56.626 --> 31:59.829
I'm not feeling great, but I'm ok. Yeah.

32:01.798 --> 32:05.798
But, this... all of this is too much.

32:07.704 --> 32:09.138
I think we need to...

32:09.138 --> 32:12.909
well, stop doing what we did.
At least for a little while.

32:12.909 --> 32:15.511
And if that means you don't like me...

32:15.511 --> 32:17.613
Hey, hey.

32:17.613 --> 32:21.651
I like you. I'm not going anywhere, ok?

33:26.306 --> 33:28.941
Hey.

33:28.941 --> 33:31.878
Want half? Their peanut
butter is all weird and oily

33:31.878 --> 33:36.349
but it's still pretty
good if you add sugar.

33:36.349 --> 33:39.185
Why are you still wearing that?

33:39.185 --> 33:40.887
Because I like it.

33:40.887 --> 33:44.223
Well, take it off before
you get a black eye to match.

33:46.025 --> 33:49.162
- No.
- What?

33:49.162 --> 33:51.331
I'm not taking it off.

33:51.331 --> 33:52.899
You want to get beat up again?

33:52.899 --> 33:54.867
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

33:54.867 --> 33:59.205
Look, I know it's easy
to feel comfortable here,

33:59.205 --> 34:01.774
but this isn't our home.

34:01.774 --> 34:03.910
You shouldn't get too
invested in these people.

34:03.910 --> 34:06.346
Why not? Don't you want a family?

34:06.346 --> 34:10.346
- I have a family.
- It's not...

34:10.817 --> 34:13.386
I like them. They're nice.

34:13.386 --> 34:16.255
And maybe it's not forever, but so what?

34:16.255 --> 34:17.757
You're going to get hurt.

34:17.757 --> 34:20.525
I already hurt.

34:28.801 --> 34:30.268
Sorry to bother you. Do you have a minute?

34:30.268 --> 34:32.438
Of course. Come on in.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.911
Have a seat.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.482
What's up?

34:42.482 --> 34:47.186
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.856
You and Stef have been
a second family to me.

34:49.856 --> 34:52.891
Have you thought any more
about talking to your mom?

34:52.891 --> 34:56.891
Oh. No, I can't. She'd lose it.

34:58.865 --> 35:02.135
I mean, if she ever found out
that you guys gave me the pill,

35:02.135 --> 35:04.871
she'd go crazy.

35:04.871 --> 35:07.807
My mom can get so mad.

35:10.810 --> 35:13.546
Your mom's not the only one.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.381
Ok...

35:15.381 --> 35:17.517
I just wanted to say thank you.

35:17.517 --> 35:20.853
- You'll tell Stef for me?
- Oh, I definitely will.

35:36.998 --> 35:38.500
Were you going to tell me?

35:38.500 --> 35:41.970
I was, when you got home.
Can we please talk in here.

35:41.970 --> 35:44.506
Well, instead I had to
learn from a 15 year old girl

35:44.506 --> 35:46.207
that my partner went behind my back.

35:46.207 --> 35:48.777
I'm sorry, but I knew
you felt a responsibility

35:48.777 --> 35:51.379
to Lexi's parents because
you're her vice principal.

35:51.379 --> 35:54.449
I did it so you did not have to.

35:54.449 --> 35:56.885
- How generous.
- That's not productive.

35:56.885 --> 35:59.087
We make decisions about
our children together.

35:59.087 --> 36:01.322
Yes, absolutely we do.

36:01.322 --> 36:04.859
But waiting to make a decision could
have made our son a father at 15.

36:04.859 --> 36:08.196
I knew you were in an awkward
position. I was very careful.

36:08.196 --> 36:09.864
I talked her through everything,

36:09.864 --> 36:13.134
and I made sure she knew
this was a last resort.

36:13.134 --> 36:15.336
Tell me you're not relieved, Lena.

36:18.106 --> 36:21.810
Hey, we've been waiting
for you. We got to go...

36:21.810 --> 36:24.045
We're gonna be late. Everybody
please come downstairs.

36:24.045 --> 36:25.747
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

36:29.851 --> 36:31.152
Where's Mariana?

36:31.152 --> 36:33.721
Probably sticking pins
in a voodoo doll of Lexi.

36:33.721 --> 36:36.191
- Hey, cool it. You owe us.
- I'm sorry.

36:36.191 --> 36:38.726
Yeah, cool it...

36:38.726 --> 36:39.994
Who you telling to cool it?

36:39.994 --> 36:41.796
Will you go get her, please?

36:41.796 --> 36:44.299
- Why do I have to go?
- Because you're our favorite.

36:47.068 --> 36:49.737
Hey... is it too late for me to tag along?

36:49.737 --> 36:51.406
No, of course not. We'd love it.

36:54.175 --> 36:56.811
Mariana, you in there?

36:56.811 --> 36:58.313
Mariana?

37:00.882 --> 37:03.718
Moms are going to kill you.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.423
Nice of you to join us, Miss Thing.

37:13.495 --> 37:15.463
What happened to your face?

37:16.965 --> 37:20.101
- Do you like it?
- No, I don't like it.

37:21.769 --> 37:23.872
- Did it hurt?
- Sort of.

37:23.872 --> 37:25.440
Of course it hurt. You
punched a hole in your face.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.776
Ok, enough. We'll deal with you later.

37:28.776 --> 37:30.178
Let's go. Everybody in the car.

37:31.713 --> 37:33.481
What is happening?

37:38.786 --> 37:40.221
What's happening?

37:53.334 --> 37:55.036
Last Tuesday night,

37:55.036 --> 37:57.505
my mother Jenna comes into the house

37:57.505 --> 38:01.175
I'm sitting in the living
room with my other mom, Kelly.

38:02.944 --> 38:06.944
Jenna asks us if we'll take a drive
with her, so we all get in the car.

38:08.850 --> 38:12.850
And as we drive, silence creeps along
like the cracks in a frozen lake.

38:14.055 --> 38:16.724
Our hearts begin to thud slowly,

38:16.724 --> 38:18.760
off beat.

38:18.760 --> 38:22.764
And I wonder and then I know.

38:22.764 --> 38:25.366
And I didn't imagine
it would end like this.

38:25.366 --> 38:27.302
I didn't imagine an ending at all,

38:27.302 --> 38:29.504
but if they were going to
tell me about the divorce,

38:29.504 --> 38:31.439
what a way to do it.

38:31.339 --> 38:33.141
I sit in the backseat and think about

38:33.141 --> 38:35.310
how lucky we were to have had this family.

38:35.310 --> 38:39.214
Their 20 years of
marriage, my 15 with them.

38:39.214 --> 38:43.084
I remember all of us, driving
for miles out on the highway

38:43.084 --> 38:45.153
until I fell asleep in the backseat.

38:45.153 --> 38:48.256
I don't want this life to
end, Jenna starts to talk.

38:48.256 --> 38:51.359
She tells me that our car

38:51.359 --> 38:55.359
is just 13 miles away from
reaching 100,000 miles now.

38:56.698 --> 39:00.168
I wonder if this is part of the
divorce speech or just a distraction.

39:00.168 --> 39:02.704
I feel angry, they should just say it.

39:02.704 --> 39:06.307
She tells me the reason we took this ride

39:06.307 --> 39:10.307
is so that we could all be there
to reach 100,000 miles together,

39:11.279 --> 39:14.616
as the people who matter in her life.

39:14.616 --> 39:18.616
Slowly, I realize that
this isn't a breakup ride

39:20.221 --> 39:23.358
or a divorce ride, or a separation ride.

39:23.358 --> 39:28.141
This is a 100,000 mile ride.

39:28.141 --> 39:31.945
We're in the car, and we're
driving on a Tuesday night,

39:31.945 --> 39:35.115
and we're 99,987 miles in.

39:35.115 --> 39:38.151
We stop for onion rings
and sundaes, keep driving.

39:38.151 --> 39:42.122
99,993 miles, Stevie Nicks.

39:42.122 --> 39:45.592
99,997 miles, Elton John.

39:45.592 --> 39:49.592
When we get to 999,999 miles we hold hands,

39:51.031 --> 39:55.031
blast Melissa Etheridge, and sing
Lucky at the top of our lungs.

39:55.289 --> 39:59.289
There are too many reasons that my mamas
found love in each other's presence.

40:00.561 --> 40:04.064
There are too many moments
when we are unbreakable,

40:04.064 --> 40:07.101
and in this moment, we are one family.

40:06.621 --> 40:10.591
Constructing road as we go,
burning bridges behind us,

40:10.591 --> 40:12.827
adding mileage like graceful aging.

40:12.827 --> 40:16.827
Driving in our car towards moonlight.

40:21.736 --> 40:23.804
All right, Garret! Woo!

40:29.176 --> 40:32.580
Hey. Congrats. You
totally blew everyone away.

40:32.580 --> 40:34.115
Aw, thanks.

40:34.115 --> 40:36.083
At least we got the happy
ending for one night.

40:36.083 --> 40:37.685
What do you mean?

40:37.685 --> 40:40.187
My moms are splitting up.
They don't think I know.

40:40.187 --> 40:44.187
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry...
- Me, too.

40:47.161 --> 40:49.931
- What's up with the face art?
- You like?

40:51.165 --> 40:53.601
Yeah, why'd you do it?

40:53.601 --> 40:55.870
I don't know. Just trying something new.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.872
You know, a little edgier.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.273
You don't have to try so hard.

40:59.273 --> 41:01.342
You're already pretty great.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.954
Will be in in a minute, you guys.

41:16.090 --> 41:18.159
So, they're really getting a divorce?

41:18.159 --> 41:19.694
They really are.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.862
Oh, my God. I can't imagine.

41:21.862 --> 41:23.965
- Thank God.
- What?

41:23.965 --> 41:25.633
I mean, "Thank God you can't imagine."

41:25.633 --> 41:27.768
- Mm.
- I can't either.

41:27.768 --> 41:31.739
I thought they would be
together forever, you know...

41:31.739 --> 41:34.742
I guess everybody thinks
that when they start a family.

41:37.244 --> 41:41.082
I'm sorry about the way
I handled the pill thing.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.652
- Not the giving it part...
