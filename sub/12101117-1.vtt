WEBVTT

01:24.927 --> 01:26.929
Pull your socks up
and get to work.

01:29.198 --> 01:31.600
By Jove,
it says I will be robbed.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.436
But how, when, what should I do?

01:42.845 --> 01:45.781
So, White Storm wants
to steal my riches.

01:46.048 --> 01:47.884
This looks like
a smart hiding place.

01:47.917 --> 01:49.018
I'm too clever.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.542
What do you think
Detective Riller?

02:47.575 --> 02:48.610
I've got it figured out.

02:49.678 --> 02:50.947
White Storm knocked
the security guard out cold,

02:51.948 --> 02:52.982
threatened the victim
into opening the safe,

02:53.682 --> 02:54.951
took the money inside,

02:54.984 --> 02:56.618
then killed the victim
with that wooden boat.

02:57.053 --> 02:59.956
You can take my for word it,

02:59.989 --> 03:02.024
mystery solved, case closed.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.758
Why not kill the security guard?

03:04.961 --> 03:08.230
He attacked me from behind,
maybe 'cause I didn't see him?

03:09.198 --> 03:11.000
Brilliant deduction. Hmm?

03:12.268 --> 03:13.102
Reasonable enough.

03:13.970 --> 03:14.636
How about
Sherlock Holmes' opinion?

03:14.669 --> 03:16.638
No need, I said "Case closed."

03:16.671 --> 03:17.907
Not so fast.

03:21.944 --> 03:24.746
Although White Storm
has committed many crimes,

03:24.780 --> 03:28.084
he has never hurt anyone,
don't you find this suspicious?

03:28.317 --> 03:30.052
There's a first time for
everything,

03:30.086 --> 03:30.853
desperate, perhaps?

03:30.886 --> 03:31.753
We don't need you here,
Sherlock.

03:31.787 --> 03:33.588
My genius
has solved the case already.

03:33.621 --> 03:34.890
So don't meddle
with the crime scene.

03:36.058 --> 03:38.660
You're the one who meddles,
I scrutinize the evidence.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.109
Oh.

03:54.944 --> 03:55.911
That really hurt.

04:28.610 --> 04:30.946
Hold on now, what are
you doing with that filthy soot?

04:30.980 --> 04:31.781
Stop right now.

04:33.015 --> 04:34.050
Sherlock, if you keep messing
with the evidence,

04:35.084 --> 04:36.252
even the Queen of England
can't bail you out.

04:39.088 --> 04:39.789
Hm.

04:41.857 --> 04:42.992
Huh? What's this?

04:45.027 --> 04:46.996
Huh?
Why is there a hole in the roof?

04:48.397 --> 04:49.631
You must be Gibson.

04:50.032 --> 04:50.933
How are you holding up?

04:51.934 --> 04:54.103
Uh, a little sore,
how did you know my name?

04:54.702 --> 04:56.105
Just a wild guess.

04:56.138 --> 04:58.340
Sherlock,
what is this all about, huh?

04:59.008 --> 05:00.776
Isn't it obvious detective,

05:00.810 --> 05:03.012
the killer is still in this room
and it's him.

05:03.946 --> 05:06.916
Huh? Me? This must be a mistake.

05:06.949 --> 05:08.951
You have a lot to learn.

05:09.819 --> 05:11.087
The safe has indeed been opened,

05:11.353 --> 05:13.322
but there's no evidence
of force.

05:14.123 --> 05:16.792
The logical conclusion,
White Storm found the key.

05:16.992 --> 05:19.061
But how would he know
where to find the key?

05:19.694 --> 05:20.728
Before each burglary,

05:20.762 --> 05:23.232
White Storm always
sends a letter to his target.

05:23.933 --> 05:26.402
<i>Alarmed, the target would move
their precious item</i>

05:26.435 --> 05:27.970
<i>to a safer location.</i>

05:29.438 --> 05:32.108
<i>In this case,
White Storm snuck in later,</i>

05:32.141 --> 05:34.276
<i>stole the key, opened the safe,</i>

05:34.310 --> 05:37.012
<i>left his signature card,
then made his getaway.</i>

05:37.346 --> 05:39.048
<i>When our victim
discovered the theft,</i>

05:39.081 --> 05:40.950
<i>he likely scolded his security.</i>

05:41.317 --> 05:45.653
So, out of anger he hit
the victim with the boat.

05:46.122 --> 05:47.689
That's not what happened,
let me go.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.125
That's not a reason
to kill someone.

05:49.158 --> 05:51.961
Detective Fox,
what know you of the victim?

05:52.161 --> 05:55.965
A great deal, he was a tycoon
in the whaling industry,

05:55.998 --> 05:58.801
extracting whale blubber
for lamps and he made a fortune.

05:59.135 --> 06:01.837
But as London gradually
converted to electricity,

06:01.871 --> 06:04.639
the entire industry collapsed.
He was forced to retire.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.408
And that is when

06:06.442 --> 06:08.444
he decided
to become a loan shark,

06:08.477 --> 06:09.411
lending money to sailors,

06:09.445 --> 06:11.313
though they couldn't afford
the interest.

06:12.348 --> 06:14.749
That's why
his most valuable assets

06:14.783 --> 06:16.819
were the loan contracts
inside the safe.

06:17.786 --> 06:19.922
<i>Who knew that White Storm
would burn them all?</i>

06:21.123 --> 06:22.391
<i>Gibson was one of his borrowers</i>

06:22.424 --> 06:25.094
<i>and was forced to work
as security to pay the debt.</i>

06:25.461 --> 06:28.063
<i>Enraged that all the contracts
had burned to ashes,</i>

06:28.097 --> 06:30.799
<i>the victim tried to force
Gibson to sign a new loan.</i>

06:31.133 --> 06:33.235
<i>Needless to say,
Gibson refused.</i>

06:33.269 --> 06:35.237
<i>Known for his greed and temper,</i>

06:35.271 --> 06:37.940
<i>the victim lashed out at Gibson
with his fountain pen.</i>

06:37.973 --> 06:40.242
<i>That is how fibers
from Gibson's clothes</i>

06:40.276 --> 06:42.011
<i>got on the tip of the pen.</i>

06:44.947 --> 06:47.682
<i>At that moment, the maid
came to serve breakfast.</i>

06:48.050 --> 06:50.819
<i>Gibson threw the new loan
contract into the fireplace.</i>

06:50.853 --> 06:52.421
<i>Then he pretended to pass out
on the floor.</i>

06:52.454 --> 06:54.722
Oh. Hold on a second.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.725
If the contract was burned,
how could you know this?

06:58.827 --> 07:01.463
Gibson hadn't noticed that
the fireplace had been put out.

07:01.497 --> 07:03.999
However, the residual heat
from the ashes was enough

07:04.033 --> 07:07.203
to singe the contract,
making it no longer legible.

07:08.170 --> 07:10.973
However, when the victim
was writing the new contract,

07:11.006 --> 07:13.008
<i>he wrote it on top of
the evening newspaper</i>

07:13.042 --> 07:13.876
<i>on the desk.</i>

07:14.610 --> 07:15.911
<i>It seems he was too angry</i>

07:15.945 --> 07:18.280
<i>because he pressed really hard
when he wrote his draft.</i>

07:18.514 --> 07:20.115
<i>The ink from the newspaper
had smeared on</i>

07:20.149 --> 07:21.350
<i>the back of the writing paper.</i>

07:22.651 --> 07:24.386
<i>Since printing ink contains
flammable substances,</i>

07:24.420 --> 07:26.855
<i>burnt-out rose singed
through the paper.</i>

07:27.156 --> 07:29.158
<i>Based on this remaining
charred fragment,</i>

07:29.191 --> 07:32.027
<i>I deduced that the evidence
might be on the newspaper.</i>

07:32.528 --> 07:35.164
<i>So I scattered charcoal dust
onto it</i>

07:35.197 --> 07:37.266
and the contract was revealed.

07:41.370 --> 07:43.939
He was a greedy wolf
who bullied the poor.

07:43.973 --> 07:44.506
I didn't mean to kill him.

07:45.441 --> 07:47.009
Let's go, save your story
for the court.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.180
Hm. That was some
lucky guess, Holmes,

07:51.513 --> 07:53.449
but White Storm,
the thief is mine.

07:53.482 --> 07:55.818
Also, he might be
out of your league.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.019
We shall see.

08:01.991 --> 08:05.995
Even the cleverest man
makes mistakes sometimes.

08:18.007 --> 08:19.942
Mr. Holmes, I guarantee you,

08:19.975 --> 08:22.144
this is absolutely the most
important invention

08:22.177 --> 08:23.178
after the steam engine.

08:23.479 --> 08:25.948
Pardon, the most important
what now?

08:26.181 --> 08:28.117
The most important invention.

08:28.150 --> 08:30.119
If you don't embrace
the new era,

08:30.152 --> 08:32.121
the new era
will leave you behind.

08:32.154 --> 08:35.190
Uh, Mr. Holmes,
this is better than anything

08:35.224 --> 08:36.992
- I ever sold you before.
- Found it.

08:37.026 --> 08:38.093
this is different.

08:39.161 --> 08:40.462
I guarantee it will
change your life forever.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.065
You can be the first one to...

08:43.098 --> 08:43.932
Please, to the point.

08:46.969 --> 08:47.336
Huh?

08:51.907 --> 08:53.809
I call it mobile phone.

08:55.177 --> 08:58.113
The mobile phone will change
communication forever.

08:58.147 --> 08:59.515
With this, you won't need to
go all the way

08:59.548 --> 09:01.350
to the post office
just to make a call.

09:01.383 --> 09:02.851
It's not working.

09:02.885 --> 09:04.520
Uh, the line
isn't connected yet.

09:04.553 --> 09:05.287
What line?

09:05.321 --> 09:06.121
The telephone line.

09:07.056 --> 09:08.324
For you, early bird price
of 100 pounds.

09:08.357 --> 09:10.025
- Why not?
- Good grief.

09:10.059 --> 09:11.627
That is three years' rent.

09:11.660 --> 09:13.162
Where will you find the money?

09:13.195 --> 09:16.098
Watson, we can't possibly
turn down such a marvel.

09:16.131 --> 09:17.366
What about our rent?

09:17.633 --> 09:19.535
You're a gifted doctor,
see more patients.

09:19.568 --> 09:20.302
Please sign here.

09:21.904 --> 09:23.439
If you don't embrace
the new era,

09:23.472 --> 09:25.040
the new era
will leave you behind.

09:25.074 --> 09:25.908
Well said.

09:27.976 --> 09:30.012
Mr. Holmes, I heard a rumor.

09:30.045 --> 09:31.347
- Huh? What is that?
- What have you heard?

09:31.380 --> 09:32.247
- What is that?
- What have you heard?

09:32.281 --> 09:33.048
What is that?

09:33.849 --> 09:35.184
It's our new home
for three years.

09:35.217 --> 09:36.385
What have you heard, Bunny?

09:37.486 --> 09:39.321
Someone's peddling jewelry
by the slums

09:39.355 --> 09:41.056
near the riverside
on the East End.

09:41.390 --> 09:42.991
I heard they're stolen goods.

09:43.025 --> 09:43.625
Shall we go look?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.862
White Storm. Onwards, Watson!

09:53.068 --> 09:55.170
I had hoped
London entered a new era.

09:55.571 --> 09:57.306
Where there is new,
there is old.

09:57.339 --> 09:59.141
People turn a blind eye
to the poor.

09:59.174 --> 10:02.211
But these are the people
who must not be forgotten.

10:03.379 --> 10:04.646
I wish we could do more.

10:05.948 --> 10:07.583
Even if you were to spend
all of your money,

10:08.183 --> 10:09.885
it would barely feed them
for a week.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.653
How much can we really help?

10:11.687 --> 10:14.089
Your words are so cold.

10:14.390 --> 10:16.959
The truth is not
always agreeable, dear Watson,

10:17.559 --> 10:20.129
The new era has abandoned

10:20.162 --> 10:22.498
not only these ships,
but people too.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.168
It's mine, I nicked it.

10:27.302 --> 10:29.138
It's mine let go of it.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.174
I told you it's mine.

10:32.207 --> 10:33.976
What do you mean it's yours?

10:34.009 --> 10:36.478
I helped nick it too,
that's not fair.

10:37.012 --> 10:37.946
Give it back.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.657
There's danger here.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.260
This way.

10:58.066 --> 11:00.369
Come on, let's go,
what are you doing?

11:01.036 --> 11:02.037
Thinking ahead.

11:05.974 --> 11:07.709
Well, well,
what do we have here, then?

11:07.743 --> 11:10.512
You see this lads,
Mr. Heartless,

11:10.746 --> 11:11.781
far from home are ya?

11:11.815 --> 11:14.616
I heard someone is peddling
acquired goods here.

11:14.650 --> 11:16.685
I'm hoping to pick up
a cheap pocket watch for myself.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.020
Acquired goods?

11:18.253 --> 11:20.189
Why not say
what you really mean?

11:20.222 --> 11:21.156
You're calling us thieves, eh?

11:22.157 --> 11:24.660
I am sure you gentlemen
abide by British law.

11:27.763 --> 11:30.299
We abide by slum laws.

11:30.332 --> 11:34.002
Slum laws, slum laws, slum laws.

11:34.804 --> 11:36.338
Since you're all experts
in the law,

11:36.672 --> 11:39.074
I wonder if you've ever
heard of this proverb.

11:39.541 --> 11:43.011
Justice is blind.

11:46.582 --> 11:47.316
Find 'em

11:52.554 --> 11:56.024
Good grief,
I'm exhausted, Sherlock.

11:56.525 --> 11:57.526
Onwards, Watson!

12:01.597 --> 12:04.533
Perhaps a spot of tea
would energize me.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.034
My thoughts exactly.

12:08.570 --> 12:12.508
I must say,
fancy, looks expensive.

12:12.741 --> 12:14.409
Good thing you have
a lot of patience.

12:15.410 --> 12:19.081
Mr. Holmes, these are
all of our cake varieties.

12:19.114 --> 12:19.816
Most kind.

12:19.849 --> 12:21.784
You certainly are amazing.

12:21.818 --> 12:23.552
While I struggle to pay
all our rent,

12:23.585 --> 12:26.121
you go around and
get treated like royalty.

12:28.156 --> 12:31.026
It turns out what Bunny heard
isn't true.

12:32.194 --> 12:34.229
No one would go to the slums
to sell jewelry.

12:34.596 --> 12:35.597
Mm.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.199
White Storm hadn't gone there
to find a buyer.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.168
He was helping the poor
with his stolen goods.

12:42.271 --> 12:44.506
Could he be a thief
with a heart?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.742
I'm guessing that
every time he goes there,

12:46.775 --> 12:48.410
<i>he would bring cakes
for the children.</i>

12:48.845 --> 12:51.814
So cake is a clue,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

12:53.415 --> 12:55.217
And I thought tea was my idea,

12:55.250 --> 12:57.085
but I see you were
way ahead of me.

12:57.119 --> 12:59.254
In all our years together,
you still amaze me.

13:01.189 --> 13:03.058
Why thank you, Dr. Watson!

13:04.159 --> 13:05.661
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

13:05.694 --> 13:07.629
May I ask how many cake shops
around here

13:07.663 --> 13:09.698
sell this same kind of
lemon cream cake?

13:09.731 --> 13:12.434
Perhaps a few,
I assure you ours is the best.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.537
Any customers come here
and buy whole cakes recently?

13:15.571 --> 13:17.807
All the time.
What do you wish to know?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.242
Any unusual customers?

13:20.676 --> 13:22.110
Uhh...

13:22.411 --> 13:24.313
Hm. There is one.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.149
On occasion he would buy
all of the lemon cream cakes.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.750
- And this morning?
- Yes.

13:28.785 --> 13:30.853
If he buys them all,
then how did I get a slice?

13:31.553 --> 13:32.688
He came late today.

13:33.923 --> 13:35.691
Most of the lemon cakes were
sold to other customers already.

13:35.724 --> 13:37.225
Your slice was the last one.

13:37.259 --> 13:39.194
You're a very lucky man,
Mr. Holmes.

13:39.561 --> 13:40.596
Indeed, I am.

13:41.630 --> 13:43.498
But this man who
buys the lemon cake, tell me,

13:43.732 --> 13:44.566
what does he look like?

13:45.634 --> 13:47.469
He's slightly taller and
older than you Mr. Holmes,

13:47.502 --> 13:48.604
<i>and he wears glasses.</i>

13:49.671 --> 13:51.373
He just ordered an extra-large,
five-pound cake

13:51.406 --> 13:53.575
to be delivered
to Santa Maria Orphanage

13:53.609 --> 13:55.711
for a birthday party
the day after tomorrow.

13:55.744 --> 13:57.613
Santa Maria Orphanage?

13:59.548 --> 14:01.216
Dr. Watson, Dr. Watson!

14:01.249 --> 14:03.820
I heard Mr. Holmes has ordered
a whole table full of cakes.

14:03.853 --> 14:04.887
Do you need my help?

14:10.592 --> 14:13.796
If only your
feet were as fast as your ears,

14:14.229 --> 14:16.231
you could have saved me
from overindulging.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.635
The cakes were simply
too delicious.

14:21.336 --> 14:23.873
White Storm buys cakes
for children all the time.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.440
It's quite benevolent of him.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.542
Come now, Sherlock,

14:28.210 --> 14:30.278
perhaps he just wants
the poor to protect him.

14:30.847 --> 14:32.414
Don't be fooled Holmes.

14:32.447 --> 14:32.882
Wise words, Wats...

14:33.850 --> 14:35.018
Unbelievable,
you're always late with rent

14:35.051 --> 14:37.954
and now dodgy people are here
smashing the flat to bits.

14:37.987 --> 14:38.855
What have you got to say?

14:39.989 --> 14:41.924
Oh, you're back.
The telephone line is connected.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.458
- Calls can be made now.
- Splendid.

14:44.726 --> 14:46.228
Huh? What is it?

14:46.261 --> 14:48.497
A telephone, my own telephone.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.332
I can make calls at home,
isn't it amazing?

14:50.365 --> 14:52.501
- Amazing.
- Isn't it expensive?

14:52.534 --> 14:54.904
Oh, Alice, if you don't
embrace the new era,

14:54.937 --> 14:56.906
the new era
will leave you behind.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.507
The future is worth
investing in.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.408
At what cost?

15:00.609 --> 15:01.710
My aunt will want to know
why you're late with the rent.

15:02.511 --> 15:03.913
Oh! This is outrageous.

15:07.349 --> 15:10.920
Ah-ha, now who shall I call?

15:11.520 --> 15:12.855
Call me, go on, call me.

15:12.889 --> 15:15.557
You're standing right here,
call you?

15:15.892 --> 15:17.225
<i>Good morning, number please.</i>

15:17.259 --> 15:19.561
Oh. Please connect me
to the Queen.

15:20.395 --> 15:21.296
The Queen?

15:21.596 --> 15:23.665
Young man, don't make pranks.

15:23.699 --> 15:25.600
There are seven other people
trying to make calls.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.003
Let me! Let me!

15:27.036 --> 15:28.871
Connect me
to the Queen of England.

15:30.907 --> 15:32.875
And what did the Queen of
England say to you?

15:34.944 --> 15:36.946
That I'm a royal pain
in the rear.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.414
What's so funny?

15:39.448 --> 15:40.917
The Queen of England,

15:40.950 --> 15:42.684
I just spoke to her
on the telephone.

15:42.718 --> 15:43.986
Isn't that amazing?

15:44.020 --> 15:45.420
I think it's really amazing.

15:50.893 --> 15:52.895
Ah. The mark of White Storm.

15:53.963 --> 15:55.965
I must reciprocate the courtesy.

16:22.024 --> 16:25.594
Story time, story time,
story time!

16:25.627 --> 16:27.629
For a rainy day, let me see.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.664
Hm. What story should I...

16:29.698 --> 16:31.934
Hey, Mistress.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes is here.

16:31.968 --> 16:33.502
He says he needs
to ask something of you.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.371
Perfect timing,
I can ask something of him also.

16:36.404 --> 16:37.874
<i>This is beneath my brilliance.</i>

16:39.075 --> 16:39.708
Go for it.

16:40.642 --> 16:43.045
Children,
please give a round of applause

16:43.079 --> 16:44.914
and welcome
our storyteller today,

16:44.947 --> 16:48.050
the great detective,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

16:48.084 --> 16:49.886
Must I really?

16:49.919 --> 16:51.087
Good morning.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.622
Actually all of
my detective stories

16:53.956 --> 16:56.458
are written by
my good friend, Dr. Watson.

16:56.826 --> 16:59.929
Please welcome the brilliant
storyteller, Dr. Watson.

17:03.765 --> 17:05.667
Don't you dare leave me alone.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.435
I couldn't find
a more brilliant mind.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.407
You want to hear
a detective mystery? Hm?

17:12.975 --> 17:13.708
Sure.

17:14.911 --> 17:19.015
One day there was an amazing
trapeze acrobat artist who...

17:19.048 --> 17:22.018
I know, he slipped and
plunged to a tragic death.

17:22.051 --> 17:23.318
That's so brilliant.

17:23.552 --> 17:23.920
I know.

17:24.486 --> 17:25.021
Thank you,

17:26.189 --> 17:28.791
the children haven't been
this happy for a very long time.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.359
We're having
a birthday party tomorrow.

17:31.393 --> 17:32.594
Why don't you come by

17:32.627 --> 17:34.063
and share more
of your wonderful stories?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.932
Sure, whose birthday is it?

17:35.965 --> 17:37.766
The oldest one in the back.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.068
Her name is Katie.

17:39.101 --> 17:39.734
I see.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.904
Then nearby cake shop
is well known

17:41.938 --> 17:42.972
for their lemon cream cake.

17:43.638 --> 17:45.007
Why don't I buy one
for the party?

17:45.041 --> 17:48.010
What a coincidence,
but you really don't have to.

17:48.044 --> 17:49.846
That cake happens to be
Katie's favorite.

17:50.046 --> 17:52.480
Her benefactor
buys one for her every year.

17:52.915 --> 17:54.050
Well, that's nice.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.918
I can't believe there's such
a giving person in London,

17:55.952 --> 17:57.053
nowadays.

17:57.086 --> 17:58.921
London has many wealthy people,

17:59.121 --> 18:01.489
but not many
are willing to donate.

18:03.558 --> 18:05.560
The only reason our orphanage
has survived

18:05.594 --> 18:07.797
is because of
his annual donations.

18:07.830 --> 18:09.966
And do you know
who this benefactor is?

18:09.999 --> 18:12.434
Unfortunately not,
he's very secretive.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.803
The end.

18:14.203 --> 18:16.072
That's the end of the story.

18:16.105 --> 18:16.738
Any questions?

18:17.706 --> 18:18.707
Yes, who ate
my muffin this morning?

18:20.775 --> 18:21.710
I'll let our great detective
find the culprit.

18:21.743 --> 18:24.579
All right then,
tell me who ate my muffin.

18:24.613 --> 18:25.413
You did.

18:25.447 --> 18:27.049
Wow, you're amazing.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.018
How come my poop
sometimes floats

18:29.051 --> 18:30.920
and sometimes sinks
to the bottom?

18:30.953 --> 18:32.054
Because when you're a good boy

18:32.088 --> 18:33.122
and eat more vegetables,

18:34.156 --> 18:34.756
fiber is lighter than water,
making your poo...

18:34.790 --> 18:36.993
So don't be a picky eater.

18:40.062 --> 18:43.598
Mr. Holmes, please, is it
possible you could help Katie

18:43.632 --> 18:47.769
find her father
so they can reunite as a family?

18:48.670 --> 18:51.439
Well, I'll try my best.

18:59.015 --> 19:00.448
Children, stop running.

19:00.482 --> 19:03.119
It was amazing to see
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

19:03.152 --> 19:05.922
When I'm older, I want to be
a great detective too.

19:05.955 --> 19:08.057
So do I, do you think maybe

19:08.090 --> 19:10.625
we should start up
our own agency someday?

19:11.027 --> 19:11.693
Hello.

19:11.726 --> 19:12.962
What is it?

19:13.595 --> 19:14.429
Ronald.

19:15.563 --> 19:16.431
Happy Birthday.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.501
It must be him.

19:21.037 --> 19:22.204
He is just a lad.

19:22.805 --> 19:24.140
Maybe White Storm is a lad.

19:24.941 --> 19:28.443
No, I doubt this lad
is Katie's father.

19:29.078 --> 19:31.680
How do you know White Storm
is the girl's father?

19:32.915 --> 19:33.983
It was tough work.

19:35.418 --> 19:37.752
<i>First, I had to deal with a
group of crazy little goblins.</i>

19:38.120 --> 19:40.056
<i>Then the giant ogre
almost choked me to death</i>

19:40.089 --> 19:41.489
<i>before I got the information.</i>

19:42.724 --> 19:45.627
<i>Her callous grandfather
didn't know who the father was.</i>

19:45.660 --> 19:46.996
<i>So he refused to take Katie in.</i>

19:47.797 --> 19:49.932
<i>She was sent to the Santa Maria
Orphanage instead,</i>

19:50.166 --> 19:53.002
<i>but the orphanage was
on the verge of closing down</i>

19:53.035 --> 19:54.769
<i>due to insufficient funding.</i>

19:55.271 --> 19:58.207
<i>However, a few years
after Katie's arrival,</i>

19:58.841 --> 20:02.577
<i>a mystery man began to donate
large sums of money every year,</i>

20:02.945 --> 20:05.848
<i>along with
a very special birthday cake.</i>

20:06.949 --> 20:09.919
Still doesn't explain why
you believe he is White Storm.

20:10.286 --> 20:11.087
I believe it.

20:12.321 --> 20:14.156
Only a monster would leave
their daughter at an orphanage.

20:14.991 --> 20:17.793
All of his targets
are either corrupt officials

20:17.827 --> 20:19.962
or those who oppose the poor
or downtrodden.

20:20.662 --> 20:22.932
Having his daughter with him
is too dangerous.

20:22.965 --> 20:25.034
Well, he shouldn't be a thief
then should he?

20:25.067 --> 20:27.669
Sacrificing in the name of
chivalry and justice

20:27.702 --> 20:29.604
is not something that
you will ever understand.

20:30.072 --> 20:32.975
Chivalry and justice?
All thieves must be caught,

20:33.009 --> 20:35.677
and if you don't catch them,
then you're just as guilty.

20:36.112 --> 20:36.812
It's him.

20:40.749 --> 20:41.283
Okay.

20:42.385 --> 20:44.086
Arresting him in front of
his daughter is too cruel.

20:44.854 --> 20:45.587
What then?

20:46.422 --> 20:48.057
His carriage is parked
at the gate.

20:48.090 --> 20:49.125
I don't think he'll stay
too long.

20:50.159 --> 20:51.760
We can box him in
from the left, right, and center

20:51.794 --> 20:52.461
when he leaves.

20:52.495 --> 20:53.661
He won't be able to get away.

20:54.263 --> 20:56.132
Yes,
I was going to suggest that.

20:56.598 --> 20:57.800
Keep an eye on the driver.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.969
He won't escape us.

21:07.009 --> 21:09.111
Hello sir,
were you thinking about playing?

21:09.812 --> 21:11.646
You might be too big
for that swing.

21:12.982 --> 21:13.949
A success this time?

21:14.616 --> 21:15.550
Try for yourself.

21:16.584 --> 21:18.921
The largest piece
is made especially for you.

21:20.056 --> 21:22.058
That's much too big,

21:22.091 --> 21:23.758
will you share half of it
with me?

21:24.293 --> 21:27.296
Sure, how is it,
does it taste okay?

21:28.130 --> 21:28.763
Mm.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.698
Come this way.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.069
They just blossomed.
Aren't they beautiful?

21:34.003 --> 21:35.071
Very beautiful.

21:35.104 --> 21:36.771
Take a sniff, they smell nice.

21:40.142 --> 21:42.677
I'm so sorry,
I forgot about your allergy.

21:42.978 --> 21:44.280
Not at all, they smell lovely.

21:44.814 --> 21:45.481
Come this way.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.652
Oh, I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.121
Sorry, I forgot the time.

21:52.154 --> 21:53.289
I'll come visit again, bye-bye.

21:54.290 --> 21:55.657
Sir! Sir!

22:01.230 --> 22:03.299
- Huh? Where's Sherlock now?
- Huh?

22:08.137 --> 22:10.738
Well, we meet in person at last.

22:10.772 --> 22:12.007
Hello there, White Storm.

22:12.441 --> 22:13.943
You have the wrong man.

22:14.310 --> 22:18.247
And you have my pipe.
Hand it over, Mack.

22:19.982 --> 22:22.717
You are the great
detective Sherlock Holmes.

22:43.139 --> 22:43.873
Give it up.

22:47.042 --> 22:48.110
No!

22:50.880 --> 22:51.679
Are you done?

22:52.815 --> 22:53.648
Want to embarrass yourself
in front of your daughter?

22:54.716 --> 22:56.651
Gotcha!
It's just as I planned.

22:56.886 --> 22:58.854
You have the right
to remain silent.

22:58.888 --> 22:59.654
Sir.

23:01.290 --> 23:04.226
Uh, Anything you say
may be used against you

23:04.260 --> 23:05.094
in a court of law.

23:06.295 --> 23:08.264
Look at you, you should have
been a law abiding citizen.

23:08.898 --> 23:11.066
You are nothing
but a lowly thief.

23:12.968 --> 23:14.270
Since this is
your first offense,

23:14.303 --> 23:16.704
the judge will likely give you
a lighter sentence,

23:16.738 --> 23:18.174
maybe just 10 years or so.

23:41.330 --> 23:41.931
What is it?

23:42.631 --> 23:44.066
Why does everybody seems so sad?

23:44.099 --> 23:46.168
See it for yourself.

23:46.202 --> 23:49.138
I can't read, how am I supposed
to know what it says?

23:50.306 --> 23:52.074
Mack,
also known as White Storm,

23:52.107 --> 23:53.442
came from a wealthy family.

23:53.909 --> 23:55.978
They made their fortune
from gems and jewelry,

23:56.178 --> 23:58.981
but things went downhill
after he took over the business.

23:59.014 --> 24:00.883
He disappeared from high society

24:00.916 --> 24:02.451
after squandering
the family fortune.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.954
If I were him, I would just
kick back and enjoy life.

24:04.987 --> 24:07.056
Why bother to rob the rich
to help the poor?

24:07.089 --> 24:09.091
Now he's in prison
because of Mr. Holmes.

24:09.124 --> 24:10.259
Keep it down.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.760
The paper calls Sherlock
heartless

24:12.795 --> 24:14.463
for capturing Mack
in front of his daughter.

24:15.030 --> 24:18.733
Mr. Holmes, you've been
playing the violin for two days.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.302
Please stop blaming yourself.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.439
Even if your hands aren't tired,
my ears are tired.

24:24.039 --> 24:26.008
Let's play blind man's bluff.

24:26.041 --> 24:29.211
Oh no, I better hide this.

24:33.115 --> 24:34.883
If you think
that's too childish,

24:34.917 --> 24:36.151
how 'bout playing
cops and robbers?

24:36.185 --> 24:37.886
You'll be the cop
and I'll be the robber.

24:38.287 --> 24:41.123
If you catch me, it will be
your greatest victory yet.

24:41.323 --> 24:42.458
Let Mr. Holmes be.

24:42.491 --> 24:43.892
I'm just trying to cheer him up.

24:44.093 --> 24:46.228
Mr. Holmes,
you haven't eaten for two days.

24:48.264 --> 24:50.065
Let's go out and have some cake.

24:50.099 --> 24:53.035
I'll be kind enough
to let you pay for it. Ha.

24:53.068 --> 24:54.970
- Ah! Good idea.
- I'm broke.

24:55.371 --> 24:56.138
- My treat.
- Mm-hm.

24:56.171 --> 24:57.139
I'm tired.

24:57.573 --> 24:58.274
Don't be lazy.

24:59.275 --> 25:01.176
You must get out of the flat!

25:04.880 --> 25:06.048
How rude!

25:06.315 --> 25:07.983
Tell me which newspaper
you're from.

25:08.350 --> 25:11.887
Oh, sorry, I'm a reporter
for the <i>London Times.</i>

25:11.920 --> 25:14.156
I'd like to have an interview
with Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

25:14.189 --> 25:16.292
Was "Heartless Sherlock"
your idea?

25:16.325 --> 25:18.227
I wish I were that creative.

25:18.894 --> 25:21.030
So, when would be a good time
for an exclusive interview?

25:21.063 --> 25:22.998
Go away, we're not interested.

25:23.032 --> 25:24.333
It won't take up
much of your time.

25:24.366 --> 25:25.834
That's Sherlock Holmes.

25:26.535 --> 25:28.971
I heard he purposefully
shamed the daughter.

25:31.340 --> 25:33.442
Sorry, this table is reserved.

25:34.009 --> 25:35.010
How about that table?

25:35.878 --> 25:38.013
Sorry, this one's reserved too!

25:38.047 --> 25:40.049
And this one's reserved,
all reserved,

25:40.316 --> 25:42.151
no available table for you.

25:42.184 --> 25:44.253
Great detective,
come and sit with me.

25:44.286 --> 25:45.821
Yippee, we have a table.

25:48.057 --> 25:50.492
You've removed a pest from
our city, today is my treat.

25:50.526 --> 25:51.060
Really?

25:51.093 --> 25:52.528
It's the least I can do.

25:52.561 --> 25:54.363
You boy, tie my shoelace.

25:54.630 --> 25:55.197
Yes, sir.

25:55.898 --> 25:56.899
Thanks to our great detective,

25:58.067 --> 25:59.835
the wealthy in London can
finally sleep well at night.

26:00.469 --> 26:02.304
You are truly unstoppable.

26:02.338 --> 26:04.073
Not only did you arrest the man,

26:04.106 --> 26:05.974
you arrested him
right in front of his daughter.

26:06.408 --> 26:08.143
Now that's dedication.

26:08.177 --> 26:10.346
Here's to you.

26:12.014 --> 26:14.283
You ought to arrest
the daughter now.

26:22.224 --> 26:24.360
You stinky skunk,
why are you here?

26:24.393 --> 26:26.028
Katie was so happy before

26:26.061 --> 26:27.496
but now
she's been crying for days.

26:28.163 --> 26:30.065
If my poop
had not sunk to the bottom,

26:30.099 --> 26:32.201
I would've scooped it out
and thrown it at you.

26:32.234 --> 26:33.302
- Get lost!
- Get lost!

27:12.107 --> 27:15.077
Mr. Holmes, I dare say
that inside this prison,

27:15.411 --> 27:16.412
at least half the inmates

27:16.445 --> 27:18.680
have their eyes on
White Storm's stolen riches.

27:18.714 --> 27:20.149
Haven't you read the papers?

27:20.182 --> 27:21.984
He donated everything
that he's stole

27:22.017 --> 27:23.485
and kept nothing for himself.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.523
Most of the shady crooks
in this cell can't read

27:28.157 --> 27:30.225
and those who can
won't believe such a story.

27:30.526 --> 27:32.327
A noble thief is unheard of.

27:32.361 --> 27:34.163
Is Mack in great danger then?

27:34.196 --> 27:36.298
We the Royal Prison Guards
are renowned

27:36.331 --> 27:38.133
for our unyielding dedication.

27:38.567 --> 27:40.068
No need to worry at all.

27:41.170 --> 27:42.004
Attention!

28:02.057 --> 28:03.192
This is a surprise.

28:03.759 --> 28:04.993
I thought I should come,

28:06.028 --> 28:08.030
best to apologize to you
in person.

28:08.597 --> 28:09.998
Apologize?

28:10.032 --> 28:10.699
My timing.

28:11.967 --> 28:15.003
A failed thief was
defeated by a skilled detective.

28:15.370 --> 28:17.005
No need to apologize.

28:18.073 --> 28:20.108
I regret taking action
on Katie's birthday.

28:21.109 --> 28:22.311
I should have found
a better way.

28:23.045 --> 28:24.746
It wasn't right
for her to see that.

28:25.647 --> 28:28.083
The timing was awful indeed.

28:28.383 --> 28:31.019
That very day,
I had planned on retiring.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.324
Legally speaking,
I can't condone stealing.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.493
The city has abandoned the poor.

28:38.060 --> 28:40.262
However, I wish you could have
found a better way as well.

28:42.064 --> 28:43.765
I thought I was doing
the right thing

28:44.433 --> 28:46.001
<i>until that last time.</i>

28:49.505 --> 28:52.207
- White Storm, White Storm!
- White Storm!

28:52.241 --> 28:52.608
What is it?

28:53.442 --> 28:55.310
Would you like some cake?

28:55.344 --> 28:56.345
I nicked them both.

28:56.378 --> 28:57.613
How amazing am I?

28:57.646 --> 29:01.016
I'm amazing,
look at this purse, snatched!

29:01.316 --> 29:02.651
But you couldn't have
snatched it

29:02.684 --> 29:04.486
if I hadn't lent you my knife.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.687
You are amazing.

29:05.721 --> 29:07.656
Of course I am.
And don't you forget...

29:07.689 --> 29:09.224
<i>That really broke my heart.</i>

29:10.158 --> 29:12.427
Turns out I had only helped
nourish their bodies,

29:13.095 --> 29:14.696
but their souls were eaten away.

29:15.664 --> 29:17.699
Children should not idolize
a thief.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.701
Truth be told Mr. Holmes,

29:20.536 --> 29:22.504
I should be thanking you
for arresting me.

29:25.541 --> 29:28.410
Instead of buying them cakes,
how about books?

29:28.443 --> 29:30.746
Detective story books?

29:31.513 --> 29:33.783
The warden said
you refuse to meet with Katie.

29:34.550 --> 29:35.717
Katie is a good girl.

29:36.518 --> 29:38.120
She deserves a better father.

29:40.556 --> 29:42.124
She's a grown woman now.

29:42.658 --> 29:44.126
I'm sure she understands.

29:44.159 --> 29:45.828
You stayed away to protect her.

29:46.261 --> 29:48.664
Understanding is not forgiving.

29:48.898 --> 29:51.500
She wouldn't have come
if she hadn't.

29:52.434 --> 29:54.503
Time is up,
save it for next time.

29:55.203 --> 29:57.606
Respect her wishes,
allow her to forgive.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.439
I am unbeatable!

31:08.377 --> 31:09.812
She wrote you a letter again.

31:09.846 --> 31:10.679
Thanks.

31:40.409 --> 31:41.944
Let the show begin.

31:51.620 --> 31:52.454
What?

31:54.924 --> 31:57.225
There's no greater game
than football.

31:57.693 --> 31:58.694
Scarface is going to kill him.

31:58.727 --> 32:00.729
I'm afraid to even sneeze
in front of the boss

32:00.762 --> 32:02.397
and Mack is picking
a fight with him!

32:02.431 --> 32:04.232
You are a dead man!

32:04.266 --> 32:06.836
I'm gonna beat the daylights
out of you!

32:20.315 --> 32:22.885
So, this Sunday
is the Queen's birthday.

32:22.919 --> 32:24.954
Let's go to the Thames
and see the fireworks.

32:25.721 --> 32:26.889
Fireworks? Boring.

32:26.923 --> 32:28.590
But they boom and bang
and stuff.

32:28.891 --> 32:31.326
Just a chemical
reaction exploding in the air

32:31.359 --> 32:33.528
while burning up
different metal powders,

32:33.562 --> 32:36.765
creating a variety of colors,
nothing special about it.

32:36.799 --> 32:38.034
I made fireworks
when I was eight.

32:38.067 --> 32:38.868
You're bluffing.

32:40.069 --> 32:40.870
Like this.

32:45.640 --> 32:48.376
Oh, this is my new dress.

32:48.811 --> 32:51.013
You're going to pay for this!

32:51.047 --> 32:53.850
Hello? Please hold.
It's for you.

32:53.883 --> 32:55.584
I'm busy,
take a message, please.

32:55.617 --> 32:57.385
He is utterly busy right now.

32:57.419 --> 32:58.620
I can take a message for him.

33:00.589 --> 33:01.556
Oh, I see.

33:02.058 --> 33:03.525
The call is from the prison.

33:03.558 --> 33:04.994
Something's happened to Mack.

33:11.033 --> 33:13.668
Apologies for asking you
to come here

33:13.702 --> 33:15.004
in such unforgiving weather.

33:15.037 --> 33:16.338
I thought you said
your guards

33:16.371 --> 33:17.539
were very dedicated,

33:17.572 --> 33:18.473
how could this happen?

33:21.643 --> 33:24.646
It's a long story,
one you can't imagine.

33:29.118 --> 33:32.054
I'm gonna beat the daylights
out of you!

33:32.088 --> 33:33.755
Huh?

33:50.605 --> 33:52.607
You broke my tooth!

33:57.712 --> 33:58.981
Hey you, stop!

34:02.885 --> 34:05.587
Get on your knees,
hands behind your head.

34:05.620 --> 34:06.088
Kneel down.

34:07.056 --> 34:08.858
How dare you pick on
someone twice your size?

34:08.891 --> 34:10.092
That's solitary confinement.

34:14.663 --> 34:15.730
I don't understand.

34:15.764 --> 34:18.767
He was a model inmate,
due for release in a year.

34:18.968 --> 34:20.870
So why the serious assault?

34:20.903 --> 34:21.871
Why break out?

34:22.504 --> 34:23.973
I thought he was
smarter than that.

34:24.907 --> 34:26.909
Perhaps he had his reasons.

34:27.475 --> 34:30.012
Indeed, it seems
Mack started a fight

34:30.046 --> 34:32.380
to get sent to solitary
for his jailbreak.

34:34.549 --> 34:35.918
That much I guessed.

34:36.585 --> 34:39.588
What's strange is why Scarface?

34:39.621 --> 34:42.724
Why risk his life with
the most vicious prisoner here?

34:45.427 --> 34:47.762
Did anything unusual
happen before his escape?

34:47.797 --> 34:48.798
Was he upset about anything?

34:48.831 --> 34:52.034
No, he just read a letter
from his daughter.

34:52.068 --> 34:54.136
A letter, do you know
what it was about?

34:54.569 --> 34:55.838
No, I didn't look.

34:56.771 --> 34:59.075
As you can see,
the door is still locked.

34:59.108 --> 35:00.742
The bars are still intact.

35:00.775 --> 35:01.911
That is strange.

35:01.944 --> 35:04.113
Oh, Detective Riller
and Detective Fox.

35:04.146 --> 35:06.983
Doctor Watson,
slow to the case I see.

35:07.515 --> 35:10.619
If you and Sherlock would like
to assist me, that's fine.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.154
Have you discovered anything?

35:12.188 --> 35:14.456
According to
the circumstantial evidence,

35:14.489 --> 35:15.925
there was only one possibility.

35:15.958 --> 35:18.895
The way I figure it,
Mack used his stolen wealth

35:18.928 --> 35:20.162
<i>to buy off a prison guard,</i>

35:20.196 --> 35:23.398
<i>and then that guard let him out
in the middle of the night,</i>

35:24.066 --> 35:26.202
All signs point to
an inside job.

35:26.235 --> 35:28.104
Are you saying it's me?

35:28.137 --> 35:29.437
You admit it!

35:29.471 --> 35:31.073
How could I do such a thing?

35:31.107 --> 35:33.608
Please Mr. Holmes,
help, won't you please?

35:36.078 --> 35:37.113
Mack escaped from here.

35:37.146 --> 35:37.847
Really?

35:37.880 --> 35:39.782
It's not like he's a cockroach.

35:39.815 --> 35:40.783
How could he squeeze through?

35:40.816 --> 35:42.018
It would be impossible for you,

35:44.053 --> 35:45.754
...but it wouldn't be
a problem for Mack.

35:45.955 --> 35:47.489
When did you get so strong?

35:48.057 --> 35:50.026
Was Mack assigned to work
in the kitchen

35:50.059 --> 35:52.061
and did he have frequent access
to this place?

35:52.995 --> 35:55.231
His duties were helping out
in the kitchen every day

35:55.264 --> 35:57.033
and cleaning this cell
every Friday.

35:58.267 --> 36:00.502
And each Friday
he tampered with the bar.

36:00.903 --> 36:03.205
If you look closely,
the bar has rust on it,

36:03.772 --> 36:05.942
evidently from the exposure
to saltwater.

36:05.975 --> 36:06.809
Hm.

36:08.044 --> 36:09.045
It does taste salty.

36:10.179 --> 36:11.781
Salt is usually
only found in the kitchen.

36:11.981 --> 36:12.580
Hm.

36:13.615 --> 36:15.952
Can you smell salt?
Why did you sniff the bar?

36:15.985 --> 36:18.054
I was trying to smell
for bodily fluids.

36:19.789 --> 36:22.490
I'm talking about saliva,
Detective Riller.

36:22.524 --> 36:23.092
You scared me.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.929
So Mack was stealing salt
from the kitchen for four years,

36:26.963 --> 36:28.931
used his saliva to dissolve
the salt,

36:29.531 --> 36:31.599
and slathered it
onto the iron bars.

36:31.968 --> 36:34.003
Wow, such determination.

36:34.536 --> 36:35.704
Are you not ashamed?

36:35.737 --> 36:37.273
If it weren't for
your sloppy supervision,

36:37.306 --> 36:40.009
how could he have stolen salt
and spat saliva? Four years?

36:40.042 --> 36:41.110
Are you blind?

36:41.143 --> 36:42.011
What do you mean?

36:43.079 --> 36:44.113
How was I supposed to know
when he was spitting?

36:44.146 --> 36:48.550
Warden, can you show us
around the perimeter wall?

36:48.583 --> 36:50.853
This way please.

37:00.997 --> 37:03.966
Uh, boss,
you really gotta wake up.

37:04.166 --> 37:07.069
Something has happened,
boss, wake up!

37:07.103 --> 37:09.038
Hey boss, you got to wake up.

37:09.704 --> 37:10.906
What if I pop that thing?

37:20.816 --> 37:21.851
Who sneezed?

37:22.084 --> 37:22.852
You did.

37:26.088 --> 37:27.023
Right, why are you here?

37:27.056 --> 37:27.957
Why am I here?

37:29.058 --> 37:30.658
Don't you remember?
Mack whacked you on the head.

37:32.028 --> 37:33.628
Oh, yes.

37:35.164 --> 37:37.066
You were saying
something has happened.

37:37.867 --> 37:39.101
Mack has busted out of jail.

37:40.102 --> 37:41.937
What, how did he escape?

37:41.971 --> 37:43.205
I heard he sawed off
the iron bars

37:43.239 --> 37:45.841
of the solitary cell window
and then climbed over the wall.

37:46.976 --> 37:49.111
The window bars were sawed off?

37:49.145 --> 37:49.945
Yes.

37:51.113 --> 37:55.117
Oh no, I was the one who
told him to saw the window bars

37:55.151 --> 37:57.953
for me to break out of here,
and I'm mad as hell right now.

37:57.987 --> 37:59.989
I'll still escape and
make him pay.

38:00.022 --> 38:01.090
But where did he go?

38:01.991 --> 38:05.027
I know, he dropped this letter
when you were fighting.

38:13.635 --> 38:15.137
Oh, if only I could read.

38:18.307 --> 38:19.674
Ah, you're awake at last.

38:19.707 --> 38:20.910
Is there any pain?

38:20.943 --> 38:21.977
It hurts so much.

38:23.112 --> 38:24.980
I wanna thorough checkup
at the hospital down the hill.

38:25.181 --> 38:27.316
That won't be necessary,
I'll take care of it.

38:28.317 --> 38:31.120
Doctor, I think you
really should consider

38:31.153 --> 38:33.089
sending me to that hospital!

38:44.266 --> 38:46.836
You see those six rags
here on the ground?

38:47.336 --> 38:50.306
They were all torn
from a jail cell quilt cover.

38:50.973 --> 38:53.809
Six rags,
did he have a bad cold?

38:54.443 --> 38:55.845
What's the use of these?

38:57.079 --> 39:00.950
This is just a smoke screen
to confuse our investigation.

39:00.983 --> 39:03.352
After all,
this prison has a rat.

39:03.886 --> 39:04.854
Help me.

39:06.155 --> 39:08.623
Warden, I just discovered this
rag outside the perimeter wall,

39:08.891 --> 39:10.826
it appeared today
after the snow melted.

39:11.260 --> 39:14.363
Hm. It's torn from
the same quilt cover.

39:15.064 --> 39:17.266
Why has this piece
fallen outside the wall?

39:20.035 --> 39:22.872
Was this water tab kept on
throughout the night?

39:23.105 --> 39:24.974
It's been raining
and snowing heavily.

39:25.007 --> 39:26.976
If the tap isn't kept on
to drip,

39:27.009 --> 39:28.844
it would freeze up
and block the pipes.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.848
Did it snow
the night before last?

39:32.882 --> 39:33.748
What was the temperature?

39:34.783 --> 39:37.853
It was snowing and
just below 10 degrees,

39:37.887 --> 39:40.089
then a few degrees warmer
when the sun came out.

39:40.122 --> 39:41.689
It rained
the day before yesterday

39:41.723 --> 39:43.691
and the temperature dropped
dramatically.

39:43.725 --> 39:45.828
A layer of ice must've formed
on the surface of the wall.

39:46.095 --> 39:47.062
<i>Thanks to this weather,</i>

39:48.097 --> 39:48.831
<i>Mack was able to create
a staircase</i>

39:49.465 --> 39:50.732
and climbed over the wall.

39:52.168 --> 39:53.269
I don't follow.

39:53.302 --> 39:54.702
The evidence is irrefutable.

39:55.037 --> 39:56.338
- Tell them, Watson.
- Me?

39:57.439 --> 39:58.174
Uh, uh.

39:59.141 --> 40:02.044
All signs point to a rat
amongst the guards.

40:02.077 --> 40:02.710
Yeah.

40:03.612 --> 40:05.314
Please let me go!
Help me, Mr. Holmes!

40:05.347 --> 40:07.917
Very well, here's my deduction.

40:08.484 --> 40:11.253
<i>Mack first drenched two rags
with the dripping water.</i>

40:11.887 --> 40:13.956
<i>He then shaped them
into fist-sized bundles</i>

40:13.989 --> 40:15.124
<i>and stuck them onto the wall.</i>

40:15.958 --> 40:17.092
<i>With the temperature so low,</i>

40:17.126 --> 40:19.228
<i>the water molecules
of the two rag bundles</i>

40:19.261 --> 40:22.164
<i>joined together with the water
molecules on the frozen wall,</i>

40:22.898 --> 40:24.967
<i>resulting in the bundle
sticking onto it.</i>

40:25.434 --> 40:27.803
<i>Mack could then use them
as stepping stones.</i>

40:27.836 --> 40:30.139
<i>He stuck two more bundles
on higher spots,</i>

40:30.172 --> 40:32.341
<i>repeating until all six
were stuck on the wall,</i>

40:32.808 --> 40:33.943
<i>allowing him to escape.</i>

40:33.976 --> 40:36.145
<i>When the sun came out
and melted the ice,</i>

40:36.178 --> 40:38.113
<i>all six bundles
fell to the ground,</i>

40:39.048 --> 40:41.283
but I have yet to figure out
the use of the rag

40:41.317 --> 40:42.717
found outside the wall.

40:44.853 --> 40:47.056
Come on, chop, chop,
whip up a plan.

40:47.856 --> 40:48.357
Hey!

40:49.558 --> 40:51.460
What are the possible escape
routes beyond the wall, huh?

40:53.095 --> 40:54.363
You've asked the right man.

40:54.830 --> 40:57.299
Only one road leads to
Barnard Castle Station.

40:58.167 --> 40:59.201
Not necessarily.

41:00.102 --> 41:02.037
Mack probably spent hours
last night

41:02.071 --> 41:03.472
waiting for the rag bundles
to freeze.

41:03.906 --> 41:06.008
It was almost dawn
when he made it over the wall.

41:06.375 --> 41:08.877
He would be easily spotted
if he took the main road,

41:10.012 --> 41:12.348
I think he must've taken
an alternative route.

41:13.182 --> 41:15.017
If he had opted for
a different route,

41:15.050 --> 41:17.886
he'd have to climb the mountain
and ski downhill.

41:18.187 --> 41:21.257
Lanky, how much time
would this route take?

41:21.290 --> 41:23.859
Sir, walking would require
two days,

41:24.059 --> 41:26.061
but if we ride horses
up the mountain,

41:26.095 --> 41:28.197
then ski downhill,
it would take half a day.

41:28.998 --> 41:31.100
This means Mack might've
only gone down halfway.

41:31.133 --> 41:32.201
We might still catch him.

41:33.135 --> 41:35.170
Good, that thief is mine.

41:35.204 --> 41:36.372
Can you gentlemen handle it?

41:36.405 --> 41:39.375
Uphill requires horseback
and downhill requires skiing.

41:40.509 --> 41:41.277
Of course.

41:41.310 --> 41:43.178
I don't know
how to ski actually.

41:43.979 --> 41:45.514
I don't know either, actually.

41:46.015 --> 41:48.017
I've told you to do
more exercises,

41:48.050 --> 41:49.852
but you sleep on your days off.

41:51.053 --> 41:54.957
But work is just so tiring
and bed is so comfy.

41:55.624 --> 41:57.860
And what could be better
than sleeping like a log

41:57.893 --> 41:59.528
on a day off?

42:01.930 --> 42:04.266
Warden, doctor says
Scarface is critical

42:04.300 --> 42:05.868
and must be sent
to the hospital.

42:06.068 --> 42:07.236
Understood, good timing.

42:07.870 --> 42:09.405
Why don't you two
ride along then?

42:10.039 --> 42:12.007
Dr. Watson can tend to Scarface

42:12.041 --> 42:14.476
and Detective Fox can be there
to keep an eye on him.

42:15.044 --> 42:16.945
- How 'bout it?
- Sounds like a plan.

42:22.484 --> 42:24.219
You guys will
probably get ahead of Mack.

42:24.486 --> 42:26.989
Remember to contact
the Barnard Castle Police

42:27.022 --> 42:28.190
and ask them to join
the pursuit.

42:28.524 --> 42:29.124
Got it.

42:31.060 --> 42:33.996
Thank you and
good luck to you all.

42:35.064 --> 42:36.031
Be careful.

42:36.298 --> 42:37.433
You too, Watson.

42:37.466 --> 42:40.069
Mr. Holmes, we're ready to go.

42:50.045 --> 42:51.180
Can we go faster?

42:51.213 --> 42:52.181
My rump is freezing.

42:53.182 --> 42:55.184
The horses are doing their best
in the snow.

42:55.217 --> 42:58.153
You can walk if you still think
your horse is too slow.

42:58.187 --> 43:00.222
Useless creature,
even a tortoise is faster.

43:23.312 --> 43:23.979
We're close.

43:24.947 --> 43:27.082
Once we're behind the trees,
we can ski down.

43:27.950 --> 43:31.653
Come on tortoise,
just a few more steps.

43:39.228 --> 43:40.896
This is the easy part.

43:41.230 --> 43:42.197
Let's go.

43:47.569 --> 43:49.037
Are you afraid?

43:49.071 --> 43:50.439
Of course. Afraid?

43:50.472 --> 43:53.075
Afraid I might be too quick
and leave you behind.

43:53.375 --> 43:56.245
Since you're that quick,
I'd better get a head start.

44:21.470 --> 44:23.439
Why are you poking me?

44:23.472 --> 44:24.106
Are we there?

44:26.074 --> 44:27.176
Pretend I'm not here.

44:27.209 --> 44:31.046
We'll part ways at the hospital,
peacefully or in pieces.

44:34.216 --> 44:35.651
Let go of him.

44:56.205 --> 44:59.007
What's that noise?

44:59.041 --> 45:00.075
Hm.

45:07.749 --> 45:09.985
My trousers,
stop pulling!

45:13.823 --> 45:15.624
You are a dead man.

45:26.768 --> 45:27.436
Hoo...

45:31.073 --> 45:34.276
Good grief,
I should've gone skiing instead.

45:36.111 --> 45:37.446
Something's there.

45:40.249 --> 45:41.116
Huh?

45:41.985 --> 45:42.651
What is it?

45:42.684 --> 45:44.353
Sca... Scarface!

45:44.386 --> 45:47.222
You'll not escape!

45:49.591 --> 45:50.726
Where are you headin'
in such a hurry?

46:07.776 --> 46:08.777
Stop right there!

46:09.879 --> 46:12.281
What good is shouting at him?
We need to give chase.

46:12.849 --> 46:15.517
As a police officer,
I have to shout out a warning.

46:16.518 --> 46:18.654
Instead of one escapee
we have two.

46:18.687 --> 46:20.589
We must inform
the local police quickly,

46:20.890 --> 46:22.825
and block off old roads
out of Barnard Castle.

46:23.659 --> 46:26.094
Quickly?
How do we get down there?

46:31.901 --> 46:33.803
As long as one
is not afraid of failure,

46:33.836 --> 46:36.171
skiing downhill
is not difficult at all.

46:37.439 --> 46:38.808
But wait, how do I stop?

46:42.244 --> 46:44.112
Huh? What is that?

46:48.183 --> 46:49.852
It looks like a quilt
from the prison,

46:50.586 --> 46:51.854
but why is it tied like that?

46:52.889 --> 46:54.690
Of course, it's a sled.

46:57.225 --> 46:58.560
<i>If Mack had sledded down,</i>

46:58.594 --> 47:00.863
<i>he might've reached Barnard
Castle Station last night,</i>

47:01.296 --> 47:03.265
perhaps escaped
on a train already.

47:04.199 --> 47:06.836
Maybe, but he couldn't have
just worn his prison garb

47:06.869 --> 47:08.838
and hopped onto a train
in plain sight.

47:08.871 --> 47:11.673
Let's wait for Detective Riller
and go down together.

47:11.707 --> 47:14.610
You stupid tree,
step aside now!

47:15.444 --> 47:17.412
Shall we head to
the local police station?

47:20.883 --> 47:23.552
They might have some information
that can help

47:24.453 --> 47:27.356
or perhaps we should
go to the hospital first.

47:35.197 --> 47:37.466
<i>We read the case reports
at the police station.</i>

47:37.867 --> 47:39.902
It seems Mack reached
the foot of the mountain.

47:39.936 --> 47:42.872
He broke into a store and
stole a change of clothes,

47:43.372 --> 47:46.141
<i>then pick-pocketed someone's
wallet at the train station.</i>

47:46.708 --> 47:49.578
It's likely that he boarded
the last train to London.

47:51.213 --> 47:52.280
What about Scarface?

47:53.415 --> 47:55.384
We searched the entire station
and couldn't find him.

47:55.417 --> 47:58.353
Who would have thought this guy
was a master of disguise?

48:00.222 --> 48:02.224
I've been running around
and haven't eaten a thing.

48:02.257 --> 48:02.925
Let's have dinner.

48:03.826 --> 48:05.928
Dinner?!
We have a mission on our hands.

48:05.962 --> 48:07.329
You're a police officer.

48:07.362 --> 48:09.899
So act like one,
focus on the case.

48:10.465 --> 48:11.466
A case of food?

48:11.968 --> 48:13.602
Uh...

48:15.737 --> 48:16.571
Dinner time.

48:21.010 --> 48:22.177
You're staring.

48:23.345 --> 48:25.480
I have a feeling there is
something you're not telling me.

48:26.248 --> 48:27.549
I know you too well.

48:27.582 --> 48:28.885
You're holding back secrets.

48:28.918 --> 48:30.585
You wait until
the moment is just right

48:30.619 --> 48:32.587
before the big reveal,
so what is it?

48:35.024 --> 48:37.559
Actually, when I heard
Mack had escaped,

48:37.592 --> 48:39.428
<i>I knew it had something
to do with Katie.</i>

48:39.929 --> 48:42.264
<i>I hadn't told you that
she's getting married tomorrow.</i>

48:42.865 --> 48:44.867
<i>After the wedding,
they plan to leave England.</i>

48:44.901 --> 48:45.868
<i>Huh?</i>

48:46.903 --> 48:48.871
So Mack broke out of jail
to attend her wedding.

48:48.905 --> 48:50.772
If Riller and Fox
were to discover this,

48:51.306 --> 48:52.975
they would wreak havoc
at the wedding.

48:53.009 --> 48:54.276
This I am certain.

48:55.277 --> 48:56.745
Riller was watching us
so I went to the prison,

48:56.779 --> 48:57.880
hoping they would follow.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.916
Misleading a detective

48:59.949 --> 49:02.317
and then assisting
a known fugitive.

49:02.751 --> 49:03.953
These are felonies.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.321
Oh, I see.

49:07.556 --> 49:08.825
This is my burden.

49:09.524 --> 49:11.861
So I feel I owe it
to Mack and his daughter.

49:33.916 --> 49:35.751
<i>My dearly beloved father,</i>

49:37.385 --> 49:39.021
<i>four years have gone by
already.</i>

49:39.554 --> 49:41.723
<i>Father, do you still remember
the last time</i>

49:41.757 --> 49:42.959
<i>we met was on my birthday?</i>

49:43.993 --> 49:44.726
<i>Days before,</i>

49:45.527 --> 49:46.695
<i>I fretted over all the things</i>

49:46.728 --> 49:47.964
<i>that I wanted to share with you.</i>

49:49.232 --> 49:50.867
<i>I wanted to show you
the flowers that I'd planted</i>

49:52.135 --> 49:53.635
<i>and let you taste
the cookies that I had baked,</i>

49:54.937 --> 49:57.940
<i>and introduce you to the man
I now call my fiancé.</i>

49:58.908 --> 50:01.844
<i>I cannot lie, for the longest
time I was jealous</i>

50:01.878 --> 50:04.046
<i>that you devoted your life
to the concerns</i>

50:04.080 --> 50:06.983
<i>and well-being of the poor,
when all I wanted was a father.</i>

50:08.583 --> 50:09.684
<i>It is not for me to judge</i>

50:09.718 --> 50:11.788
<i>whether your actions
were right or wrong,</i>

50:12.789 --> 50:15.557
<i>but even if the whole world
thinks you're a bad man,</i>

50:15.958 --> 50:17.894
<i>you will always be my hero.</i>

50:18.094 --> 50:21.964
<i>And my dearest father,
if there were ever a chance,</i>

50:22.564 --> 50:24.533
<i>I hope one day
to hear everything about</i>

50:24.566 --> 50:27.435
<i>who you really are,
father to daughter.</i>

50:28.137 --> 50:29.304
<i>Will you tell me?</i>

50:33.042 --> 50:34.877
<i>I may not have the necessary
wisdom</i>

50:34.911 --> 50:36.711
<i>to help you tackle
big problems,</i>

50:37.113 --> 50:38.713
<i>but at least for that moment,</i>

50:38.747 --> 50:41.884
<i>I can be there for you
and share your burdens.</i>

50:42.617 --> 50:45.788
<i>This Sunday, I'm getting
married at St. Martin's Church.</i>

50:47.056 --> 50:49.491
<i>Although you won't be there
to walk me down the aisle,</i>

50:49.926 --> 50:52.028
<i>I know you are with me
no matter where you are.</i>

50:54.729 --> 50:57.900
<i>My husband and I will journey
to universities in the Far East</i>

50:58.466 --> 51:01.003
<i>and pass on the knowledge
of science to the local people.</i>

51:01.971 --> 51:03.906
<i>Perhaps,
this is an alternative way</i>

51:04.439 --> 51:06.741
<i>to carry on your ambition
and legacy.</i>

51:08.077 --> 51:10.378
<i>Your loving daughter, Katie.</i>

51:18.453 --> 51:19.088
I do.

51:21.423 --> 51:25.094
I know pronounce you
husband and wife.

52:00.029 --> 52:02.664
You do know you've risked it all
with your jailbreak.

52:03.099 --> 52:04.466
So, was it worth it?

52:05.101 --> 52:05.902
Greatly.

52:08.004 --> 52:10.739
I knew that I wouldn't be able
to walk her down the aisle,

52:11.841 --> 52:13.976
but at least I had the chance
to witness her wedding.

52:15.044 --> 52:17.847
Don't worry, I'll give myself in
once they're gone.

52:18.214 --> 52:20.816
I won't allow her
to have a fugitive for a father.

52:21.616 --> 52:22.985
If this was how you felt,

52:23.019 --> 52:24.954
then how is it you didn't quit
for her sake?

52:24.987 --> 52:28.757
Because I was very naive
when I went to jail.

52:28.791 --> 52:30.592
I thought
I could change the world...

52:32.828 --> 52:35.831
but I didn't realize that
I first had to change myself.

52:43.072 --> 52:44.941
Let's switch to a lighter topic.

52:45.674 --> 52:47.676
I commend the frozen staircase,

52:48.110 --> 52:50.212
but what about the piece of
rag found outside the wall?

52:52.447 --> 52:53.816
The frozen staircase wasn't
strong enough

52:53.849 --> 52:54.716
to support my weight,

52:54.749 --> 52:56.451
fell apart
as soon as I stepped on it,

52:57.652 --> 52:58.653
<i>I quickly had to come up with
another plan.</i>

53:00.122 --> 53:01.756
<i>I tore the quilt into strips,
then tied them to make a rope.</i>

53:01.991 --> 53:03.059
<i>I needed warm water,</i>

53:04.492 --> 53:05.694
<i>so I,</i>
<i>used bodily fluid on the rope</i>

53:06.996 --> 53:07.830
<i>and threw the heated and
soaked end over the wall.</i>

53:09.165 --> 53:10.232
<i>My fluid's temperature
was nearly as warm as my body,</i>

53:11.300 --> 53:13.069
<i>approximately
37 degrees Celsius.</i>

53:13.803 --> 53:15.104
<i>When the warm,
soaked end of the rope</i>

53:15.137 --> 53:16.238
<i>touched the frozen wall,</i>

53:17.472 --> 53:19.976
<i>the warm fluid molecules
melted the icy water molecules.</i>

53:20.309 --> 53:23.112
<i>The melted moisture froze
due to the cold temperature,</i>

53:23.145 --> 53:24.947
<i>forming a strong adhesion.</i>

53:24.981 --> 53:26.949
<i>However,
when I was climbing the wall,</i>

53:27.283 --> 53:29.517
<i>I realized the rope could not
hold up for too long.</i>

53:30.019 --> 53:32.520
<i>Sure enough, it tore
when I was halfway down.</i>

53:32.989 --> 53:35.124
<i>Luckily my landing
was softened by the snow.</i>

53:35.825 --> 53:38.294
When the sun came out and
melted away the ice on the wall,

53:38.327 --> 53:40.863
the broken piece of rag
fell outside the perimeter.

53:41.130 --> 53:42.098
I see.

53:43.099 --> 53:44.166
Ah, the wagon's here.

53:48.037 --> 53:49.105
But you couldn't have predicted

53:49.138 --> 53:50.772
when Katie would get married.

53:50.806 --> 53:52.942
Yet you spent years
breaking the iron bar.

53:53.943 --> 53:54.944
An opportunity.

53:56.045 --> 53:56.879
One of the prisoners noticed
that I'd been assigned

53:56.912 --> 53:59.248
to clean
the solitary confinement cell.

53:59.949 --> 54:03.019
So really, I was forced
to break the bar for his escape.

54:04.619 --> 54:06.088
Are you talking about Scarface?

54:06.122 --> 54:07.655
He escaped from the prison
yesterday.

54:07.689 --> 54:08.757
What?

54:09.291 --> 54:12.962
Don't worry, I doubt
he would know to find you here.

54:38.187 --> 54:39.021
Honey?

54:55.137 --> 54:56.305
Mack!

54:57.373 --> 54:59.909
You wretched back-stabber,
you can't hide from me.

54:59.942 --> 55:01.143
You want your daughter back?

55:01.643 --> 55:03.813
Show yourself at once!

55:03.846 --> 55:04.280
Shh.

55:06.648 --> 55:07.149
Jump down.

55:07.983 --> 55:10.286
Trying to flee?
Over my dead body.

55:11.987 --> 55:13.956
Ronald!

55:15.891 --> 55:17.960
- Katie!
- Show yourself now!

55:17.993 --> 55:19.694
Give us back Katie!

55:22.298 --> 55:25.301
Scarface, release my daughter,
it's me you want.

55:26.035 --> 55:26.869
Father!

55:28.070 --> 55:32.208
I've come to realize
the more agitated you are,

55:32.241 --> 55:34.043
the more exhilarated I get.

55:38.981 --> 55:39.915
Stop the car!

55:39.949 --> 55:40.783
Stop the car!

56:05.707 --> 56:07.009
How dare you?

56:10.246 --> 56:11.013
Katie!

56:13.449 --> 56:14.350
Father!

56:15.417 --> 56:16.418
I must borrow this.

56:16.452 --> 56:18.154
Sherlock Holmes took my bicycle.

56:20.356 --> 56:23.125
Sir, do your civic duty
and loan me your car.

56:23.159 --> 56:25.027
- Hm?
- Please, take this payment.

56:27.263 --> 56:28.330
Watch out.

56:35.337 --> 56:36.172
Get in.

57:14.109 --> 57:15.077
Katie!

57:56.085 --> 57:57.486
I can make it, I can make it,
I can make it.

57:57.519 --> 57:58.887
I can make it, I can make it,

57:58.921 --> 57:59.455
- I can make it!
- Sherlock!

57:59.488 --> 58:00.122
He won't make it

58:10.566 --> 58:12.968
No!

58:20.042 --> 58:21.877
That's a dead end,
the other way.

58:53.876 --> 58:56.211
No, no!

59:03.152 --> 59:06.522
No, both ways are not good.

59:23.405 --> 59:26.108
Scarface, I know where
Mack kept his money!

59:26.342 --> 59:27.843
It's yours, for Katie.

59:28.177 --> 59:30.145
Sherlock the Heartless?

59:30.179 --> 59:33.349
You want the girl,
you'll hear from me soon.

1:00:04.546 --> 1:00:05.581
I failed, Watson.

1:00:06.682 --> 1:00:08.050
I let Scarface escape.

1:00:10.519 --> 1:00:13.956
Don't worry, I doubt
he would know to find you here.

1:00:14.490 --> 1:00:16.091
You tried your best, Sherlock.

1:00:16.325 --> 1:00:17.893
You mustn't blame yourself.

1:00:19.728 --> 1:00:21.029
It was my fault.

1:00:21.063 --> 1:00:23.165
I cannot believe
I lost her letter.

1:00:25.033 --> 1:00:29.037
Katie, even the cleverest man
makes mistakes sometimes.

1:00:30.038 --> 1:00:33.409
There was a time
when I had said similar words,

1:00:34.710 --> 1:00:38.080
but I didn't expect that
the mistake would be my own.

1:00:40.149 --> 1:00:41.250
We've got you now.

1:00:42.217 --> 1:00:42.651
Where is Mack?

1:00:43.685 --> 1:00:45.554
Sherlock,
are you hiding the fugitive?

1:00:47.189 --> 1:00:48.390
- What are you up to?
- Where is he?

1:00:48.424 --> 1:00:49.258
Tell us now.

1:00:49.992 --> 1:00:50.959
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

1:00:50.993 --> 1:00:53.295
Hold on, don't come so close.

1:00:53.328 --> 1:00:55.597
Blimey,
you're like a wet sponge.

1:00:56.165 --> 1:00:58.934
Geez, men don't sob
like little children,

1:00:59.234 --> 1:01:02.037
and what's that,
what's coming out of your nose?

1:01:02.070 --> 1:01:02.671
Stop that!

1:01:09.511 --> 1:01:11.213
Scarface grew up around here,

1:01:11.513 --> 1:01:14.049
a known bully
we were glad to be rid of.

1:01:14.082 --> 1:01:16.185
He was muscle
for that whaling tycoon,

1:01:16.218 --> 1:01:18.320
but once he went to jail,
life was better.

1:01:18.554 --> 1:01:22.057
<i>Now that he's escaped prison,
everyone lives in fear again.</i>

1:01:23.091 --> 1:01:24.593
We all know
you've been good to us.

1:01:25.394 --> 1:01:28.363
Just not right that
your daughter's in danger.

1:01:29.364 --> 1:01:30.365
Thank you, George.

1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:34.169
Besides
his two former underlings,

1:01:34.203 --> 1:01:36.038
some other fools are willing
to be his minions.

1:01:37.105 --> 1:01:39.541
Be careful tomorrow
during the hostage exchange.

1:01:40.075 --> 1:01:42.244
If you need any help,
give us a holler.

1:01:42.678 --> 1:01:44.012
We have your back.

1:01:44.814 --> 1:01:46.515
Scarface is not to be trusted.

1:01:47.082 --> 1:01:48.183
I appreciate the sentiment,

1:01:48.217 --> 1:01:49.651
but I must
take care of this alone.

1:01:50.085 --> 1:01:52.488
Where would you find the money
to pay the ransom?

1:01:53.121 --> 1:01:53.655
Can't offer money...

1:01:55.324 --> 1:01:57.526
I can only offer my life.

1:02:30.192 --> 1:02:31.126
What is it?

1:02:32.127 --> 1:02:33.195
Onwards, Watson.

1:02:33.228 --> 1:02:34.630
Where to?

1:02:54.616 --> 1:02:57.352
You have me,
now let my daughter go.

1:02:58.220 --> 1:02:59.288
Where's my money?

1:02:59.889 --> 1:03:01.089
Listen, Scarface,

1:03:02.324 --> 1:03:03.392
we wouldn't walk out of here
alive if I brought the money.

1:03:04.259 --> 1:03:06.595
Let go of my daughter
and I'll stay.

1:03:07.195 --> 1:03:09.464
Once Katie is safe, someone
will move the money here.

1:03:09.498 --> 1:03:10.332
Move?

1:03:11.834 --> 1:03:13.435
I don't care for the poor.

1:03:13.870 --> 1:03:15.571
You never believed the press.

1:03:16.238 --> 1:03:18.875
I have so much stolen money,

1:03:18.908 --> 1:03:20.342
10 men couldn't carry it all.

1:03:20.375 --> 1:03:22.277
- Really?
- You're now a fugitive.

1:03:22.879 --> 1:03:24.814
My money can buy your freedom.

1:03:26.248 --> 1:03:28.750
Take the deal
or kiss the money goodbye.

1:03:29.551 --> 1:03:30.686
You're a smart man.

1:03:30.719 --> 1:03:32.220
You know it's the right move.

1:03:35.724 --> 1:03:37.359
Bloody hell!

1:03:44.199 --> 1:03:44.766
This way.

1:03:45.167 --> 1:03:45.734
Right.

1:03:48.905 --> 1:03:50.639
Your father asked us
to come get you.

1:03:50.672 --> 1:03:51.506
Are you hurt?

1:03:52.207 --> 1:03:54.811
No, Father...

1:03:55.845 --> 1:03:58.213
traded his life for mine.

1:03:58.246 --> 1:03:59.314
Don't lose hope just yet.

1:03:59.348 --> 1:04:02.417
We can still save him,
but you'll have to trust me.

1:04:06.856 --> 1:04:08.457
Your father asked me
to give this to you.

1:04:10.192 --> 1:04:11.828
Scarface only
broke out of jail recently.

1:04:12.394 --> 1:04:14.363
He couldn't have prepared
two captivity sites.

1:04:15.230 --> 1:04:17.265
If we can locate
where he kept you last night,

1:04:17.299 --> 1:04:18.734
we can probably
save your father.

1:04:19.635 --> 1:04:21.136
But I was blindfolded.

1:04:22.638 --> 1:04:23.906
We first need to go to my home

1:04:23.940 --> 1:04:25.240
and pick up a secret weapon,

1:04:26.441 --> 1:04:29.846
and as much as it pains me,
I must ask someone for help.

1:04:32.247 --> 1:04:34.349
Are those begging tears I see?

1:04:34.383 --> 1:04:36.385
You want tears,
I can ask Dr. Watson.

1:04:36.418 --> 1:04:37.586
Ah, never mind.

1:04:37.619 --> 1:04:39.187
How may I be of assistance?

1:04:39.688 --> 1:04:41.390
In the entire city of London,

1:04:41.423 --> 1:04:44.359
you're the only man capable of
taking down Scarface.

1:04:44.393 --> 1:04:45.594
You're a wise man.

1:04:45.962 --> 1:04:47.696
Like I said, Mack is mine.

1:04:47.897 --> 1:04:51.166
Catching two fugitives at once
sounds smashing.

1:04:52.234 --> 1:04:54.837
Katie, you don't have to worry
now that I'm in charge.

1:04:54.871 --> 1:04:56.939
I'll rescue your father and
then,

1:04:56.973 --> 1:05:00.375
back to prison,
money back guaranteed.

1:05:00.943 --> 1:05:02.544
Sherlock, what's the plan?

1:05:02.577 --> 1:05:03.913
After we parted the crossing,

1:05:03.946 --> 1:05:05.714
where did Scarface
then take you?

1:05:05.948 --> 1:05:08.583
I woke up by a bay
with many old ships

1:05:08.617 --> 1:05:10.419
reeking with a nauseous,
fishy smell.

1:05:10.719 --> 1:05:12.587
After he met up
with his associates,

1:05:12.621 --> 1:05:15.858
he covered my eyes with cloth
and pulled me onto a carriage.

1:05:15.892 --> 1:05:17.459
I couldn't see anything
after that.

1:05:19.428 --> 1:05:20.429
How about during the ride?

1:05:20.797 --> 1:05:22.230
Did you hear anything
on the way?

1:05:22.932 --> 1:05:24.633
Any distinctive smells?

1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.703
I'm pretty sure
we crossed two rivers.

1:05:28.270 --> 1:05:30.405
I could hear the horses' hooves

1:05:30.439 --> 1:05:33.876
as we crossed a stone bridge
and a wood one.

1:05:33.910 --> 1:05:36.946
If this was the starting point,
crossing two rivers...

1:05:38.447 --> 1:05:38.881
Head north.

1:05:39.448 --> 1:05:40.215
Let's go.

1:05:40.649 --> 1:05:41.249
Let's go!

1:05:51.060 --> 1:05:52.327
The stone bridge.

1:05:56.933 --> 1:05:59.601
Yes, I hear the first bridge.

1:06:04.974 --> 1:06:07.375
And now,
this is the second bridge.

1:06:08.477 --> 1:06:10.913
There should be church bells
a bit further on.

1:06:12.782 --> 1:06:13.783
Turn right up ahead.

1:06:25.761 --> 1:06:27.797
Hm. Which way
should we take now?

1:06:28.831 --> 1:06:31.299
Hm. Three roads.

1:06:32.001 --> 1:06:33.368
- What's next?
- Um. Well...

1:06:33.401 --> 1:06:34.402
Well, what else did you hear?

1:06:34.436 --> 1:06:36.404
No, I didn't hear any sounds.

1:06:36.438 --> 1:06:38.941
What about smells,
any special odors?

1:06:39.374 --> 1:06:40.709
No, nothing.

1:06:41.777 --> 1:06:42.744
Tough luck, let's go back.

1:06:42.778 --> 1:06:45.747
Don't you think we could
explore all three roads?

1:06:45.782 --> 1:06:47.616
We might discover something
if we do.

1:06:47.917 --> 1:06:50.820
This is a valuable lesson,
pay attention now.

1:06:51.386 --> 1:06:52.955
Your father chose to be a thief.

1:06:53.488 --> 1:06:55.925
If he had behaved like
other law-abiding citizens,

1:06:56.458 --> 1:06:58.828
maybe he wouldn't have
ended up like this.

1:06:59.095 --> 1:07:01.396
When you become a mother
in the future,

1:07:01.429 --> 1:07:02.899
take good care of your children.

1:07:02.932 --> 1:07:05.067
Don't ever
send them to orphanages.

1:07:05.101 --> 1:07:07.103
I remember now.
After hearing the church bells,

1:07:07.136 --> 1:07:08.871
I felt pressure in my ears.

1:07:09.604 --> 1:07:10.405
Pressure?

1:07:10.438 --> 1:07:10.973
Mm-hm.

1:07:12.909 --> 1:07:15.343
The road you took
was the uphill one on the left.

1:07:16.045 --> 1:07:18.647
The stress of weighted air
is air pressure.

1:07:19.015 --> 1:07:21.616
On ground level,
the air pressure inside

1:07:21.650 --> 1:07:23.752
<i>and outside the eardrum
is the same,</i>

1:07:23.786 --> 1:07:25.387
<i>so there is no discomfort.</i>

1:07:26.688 --> 1:07:28.090
<i>But traveling uphill within
a short period of time,</i>

1:07:28.557 --> 1:07:29.959
<i>the pressure
outside the eardrum</i>

1:07:29.992 --> 1:07:31.593
<i>is lower than
the pressure inside,</i>

1:07:31.928 --> 1:07:33.762
<i>causing discomfort in the ears.</i>

1:07:35.463 --> 1:07:37.099
The uphill road leads to
a neighborhood,

1:07:37.133 --> 1:07:38.901
about 20 to 30 houses.

1:07:40.002 --> 1:07:40.903
Let's take a look.

1:07:55.684 --> 1:07:58.120
20 to 30 houses?
We can't knock on every door.

1:07:58.788 --> 1:07:59.688
I remember now,

1:07:59.721 --> 1:08:00.890
when they were pushing me
into the house,

1:08:00.923 --> 1:08:03.425
<i>I saw some small whitish,
yellowish flowers</i>

1:08:03.458 --> 1:08:03.893
<i>on the ground.</i>

1:08:05.828 --> 1:08:06.561
Did you hear that?

1:08:06.996 --> 1:08:07.897
Target confirmed.

1:08:18.573 --> 1:08:19.275
Let's pull over.

1:08:19.308 --> 1:08:20.977
The wagon might alert Scarface.

1:08:23.813 --> 1:08:25.915
Why don't you guys go ahead
and find the house?

1:08:26.681 --> 1:08:28.150
I'll stay here
and protect Katie.

1:08:29.218 --> 1:08:30.052
Seriously?

1:08:32.855 --> 1:08:34.623
Actually, I'd like to stay back
and protect Katie too.

1:08:34.656 --> 1:08:35.958
Why can't you be brave, huh?

1:08:36.591 --> 1:08:38.961
Because
I'm slightly traumatized.

1:08:38.995 --> 1:08:39.929
What a bunch of mice.

1:08:42.497 --> 1:08:44.066
It's fine,
I'll go with Detective Riller.

1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:47.069
Katie,
please protect these two for me.

1:08:48.104 --> 1:08:49.071
What?

1:09:00.216 --> 1:09:02.018
Have you seen
anything suspicious?

1:09:02.051 --> 1:09:03.986
Every house is very colorful.

1:09:09.125 --> 1:09:11.827
Maybe Katie's eyes
had played tricks on her.

1:09:12.795 --> 1:09:15.463
She was terrified and
blindfolded, but she's smart.

1:09:15.697 --> 1:09:16.866
I do believe her.

1:09:18.767 --> 1:09:19.534
Ah.

1:09:20.836 --> 1:09:23.638
I must say,
the shadow is really pretty.

1:09:24.506 --> 1:09:26.608
It's glistening
like a set of gold teeth.

1:09:29.011 --> 1:09:29.812
What is it?

1:09:35.583 --> 1:09:36.484
This is the house.

1:09:38.753 --> 1:09:41.991
I only see iron gates, where
are you seeing the flowers?

1:09:42.258 --> 1:09:43.793
I worry about you, Sherlock.

1:09:44.592 --> 1:09:46.095
There are no flowers
at this place,

1:09:46.796 --> 1:09:47.797
<i>but when the sun is shining</i>

1:09:47.830 --> 1:09:49.065
<i>from behind
the iron gates at 10 AM,</i>

1:09:49.932 --> 1:09:52.068
<i>sunlight would shine through
the small perforations</i>

1:09:52.101 --> 1:09:52.902
<i>in the iron gates</i>

1:09:54.070 --> 1:09:55.104
<i>and cast glistening patterns
on the ground.</i>

1:09:56.339 --> 1:09:58.707
<i>Those must be the small,
whitish flowers that Katie saw.</i>

1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:06.648
Here's food.

1:10:08.084 --> 1:10:08.750
Huh?

1:10:09.852 --> 1:10:13.621
Young lad, the food is
too far away for me to reach.

1:10:15.024 --> 1:10:15.958
I'm not your servant.

1:10:15.992 --> 1:10:18.493
Crawl over here and
gobble it up like a dog.

1:10:18.794 --> 1:10:19.862
Serves you right.

1:11:19.721 --> 1:11:20.956
You need to pull it.

1:11:22.825 --> 1:11:23.826
What is that?

1:11:25.995 --> 1:11:26.628
Hand it over.

1:11:42.978 --> 1:11:44.146
No you don't!

1:11:55.991 --> 1:11:56.892
Ha-ha!

1:11:58.260 --> 1:11:59.261
Let me go!

1:11:59.295 --> 1:12:00.728
Let go of me right now!

1:12:01.197 --> 1:12:02.298
Watch this kid.

1:12:04.433 --> 1:12:06.634
Scarface,
you're totally surrounded!

1:12:06.969 --> 1:12:08.971
Be smart and
surrender yourself now.

1:12:12.108 --> 1:12:14.009
It's too dangerous,
please wait.

1:12:19.248 --> 1:12:20.015
Huh?

1:12:25.788 --> 1:12:29.657
Hey, we had a deal and now
you have people come after me.

1:12:29.691 --> 1:12:32.094
You can't trust the word
of a criminal these days.

1:12:32.128 --> 1:12:33.195
Time to say goodbye.

1:12:37.166 --> 1:12:38.968
You're White Storm.

1:12:42.171 --> 1:12:43.906
Katie stay back, get away!

1:12:45.207 --> 1:12:49.345
Scarface, here's what you want,
now release my father.

1:12:49.912 --> 1:12:52.281
I knew it,
your generosity was fake.

1:12:52.314 --> 1:12:55.750
You stashed the jewelry
and put on an act of nobility.

1:12:55.784 --> 1:12:58.087
That's right,
my generosity was an act.

1:12:58.787 --> 1:13:01.023
I fooled the world
that I was a noble thief.

1:13:01.056 --> 1:13:03.058
Only children would believe
such a sham.

1:13:05.294 --> 1:13:08.130
White Storm,
you're to blame for all this.

1:13:08.164 --> 1:13:10.166
Nobody crosses me, nobody!

1:13:10.199 --> 1:13:12.001
You're gonna get
what you deserve.

1:13:12.034 --> 1:13:13.936
Unlike you,
I'm a man of my word.

1:13:23.045 --> 1:13:24.180
It's dangerous, get away.

1:13:24.213 --> 1:13:25.147
Father!

1:13:28.184 --> 1:13:29.285
Father!

1:13:29.318 --> 1:13:30.886
- Run away.
- Father!

1:13:55.144 --> 1:13:55.911
Father?

1:13:56.778 --> 1:13:58.781
I'm sorry.
I failed you as a father.

1:14:01.016 --> 1:14:02.051
Let me take a look.

1:14:04.119 --> 1:14:05.387
And what about this boy?

1:14:09.058 --> 1:14:11.026
Go on, you want to go to jail?

1:14:11.994 --> 1:14:12.795
You're letting me off?

1:14:12.828 --> 1:14:15.864
Go, but just
remember this lesson,

1:14:16.165 --> 1:14:18.267
stay in school and
learn right from wrong.

1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:21.003
Grow up a good man, got it?

1:14:23.872 --> 1:14:26.008
Didn't you say that
all thieves must be caught?

1:14:26.041 --> 1:14:26.508
Yeah.

1:14:27.775 --> 1:14:30.045
Locking him in jail would only
expose him to bad influences.

1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.483
The bullets didn't hit
any vital organs, he'll be fine.

1:14:35.384 --> 1:14:36.318
Father!

1:14:39.188 --> 1:14:41.857
Mr. Holmes, thank you.

1:14:45.027 --> 1:14:47.029
You should be thanking Katie
instead.

1:14:47.062 --> 1:14:49.365
We were able to find you
because of her brilliance.

1:14:57.139 --> 1:15:00.342
Mack, I understand why
you tarnished your own image

1:15:00.376 --> 1:15:03.512
in front of the boy,
shattering his idea of a thief.

1:15:04.313 --> 1:15:06.982
But I'm curious about
the jewelry that you gave Katie.

1:15:08.150 --> 1:15:11.020
Oh, that necklace
is my family heirloom.

1:15:11.453 --> 1:15:13.555
<i>I didn't have a chance
to give it to Katie's mother,</i>

1:15:14.056 --> 1:15:15.891
<i>but now I can
pass it on to Katie</i>

1:15:15.924 --> 1:15:18.994
as a wedding gift for
her and her husband's future.

1:15:41.050 --> 1:15:42.117
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

1:15:44.987 --> 1:15:47.423
- Goodbye!
- Bye, Katie!

1:15:47.456 --> 1:15:49.158
- Bye-bye, Katie!
- Bye!

1:15:49.191 --> 1:15:50.826
- Bye!
- We'll see you again soon!

1:15:51.193 --> 1:15:52.995
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

1:15:54.897 --> 1:15:55.297
Oh!

1:15:57.066 --> 1:15:58.000
Again?

1:16:04.173 --> 1:16:06.175
Father, take care!

1:16:06.208 --> 1:16:07.376
You too, Katie!

1:18:30.319 --> 1:18:31.253
Ah!

1:18:32.721 --> 1:18:34.289
Wow, what a delight.

1:18:34.323 --> 1:18:36.091
- Wow!
- So many cakes.

1:18:37.259 --> 1:18:38.527
How can we finish them all?

1:18:40.596 --> 1:18:41.330
Excuse me.

1:18:42.331 --> 1:18:44.166
Mr. Holmes,
ever since you caught Scarface,

1:18:44.199 --> 1:18:46.201
you haven't come by
for quite a while.

1:18:46.535 --> 1:18:48.070
May I have your autograph,
please?

1:18:50.105 --> 1:18:51.073
My pleasure.

1:18:52.174 --> 1:18:54.243
Your lemon cream cake
must be as popular as ever.

1:18:54.276 --> 1:18:55.677
I don't see any left today.

1:18:55.711 --> 1:18:58.080
Yes, they sell out quickly
every day.

1:18:58.514 --> 1:19:01.149
Oh, I must have been
very lucky then.

1:19:01.183 --> 1:19:03.552
I would not have solved the case
if not for that cake.

1:19:03.585 --> 1:19:05.087
Solved the case?

1:19:05.855 --> 1:19:08.123
Now that you mention it,
I should tell you.

1:19:08.490 --> 1:19:09.157
Tell me what?

1:19:10.125 --> 1:19:11.326
Remember how I told you
the other customers

1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:12.294
bought the rest of the cake

1:19:12.327 --> 1:19:14.530
and there was
only one slice left for you?

1:19:14.563 --> 1:19:15.163
I remember.

1:19:16.365 --> 1:19:18.600
When I said other customers,
there was actually only one.

1:19:19.134 --> 1:19:20.569
He had a scar under
his right eye

1:19:20.602 --> 1:19:21.804
that looked like a teardrop,

1:19:21.838 --> 1:19:23.238
a very distinguishable mark.

1:19:23.705 --> 1:19:25.842
He actually paid for
that last slice you ate.

1:19:25.875 --> 1:19:27.543
He told me to
only give it to you,

1:19:27.576 --> 1:19:29.177
but I must keep it a secret.

1:19:29.211 --> 1:19:30.512
It was a surprise for you.

1:19:34.383 --> 1:19:36.184
We meet in person at last.

1:19:36.218 --> 1:19:37.119
Hello, there, White Storm.

1:19:37.152 --> 1:19:39.354
That cake happens to be
Katie's favorite.

1:19:39.388 --> 1:19:41.590
Her benefactor buys one for her
every year.

1:19:41.891 --> 1:19:42.691
Such a giving person.

1:19:43.425 --> 1:19:46.194
Even if you spent
all of your money,

1:19:46.228 --> 1:19:48.230
it would barely feed them
for a week.

1:19:48.263 --> 1:19:49.131
What have you heard, Bunny?

1:19:50.065 --> 1:19:50.833
Somebody's peddling jewelry
by the slums

1:19:50.867 --> 1:19:52.802
near the riverside
in the East End.

1:19:55.237 --> 1:19:59.842
I heard that someone is peddling
stolen goods by the slum area,

1:19:59.876 --> 1:20:02.110
near the riverside
in the East End.

1:20:02.444 --> 1:20:03.378
Shall we go look?

1:20:04.713 --> 1:20:06.415
<i>Was
"Heartless Sherlock" your idea?</i>

1:20:07.215 --> 1:20:08.517
I wish I were that creative.

1:20:12.922 --> 1:20:14.791
Huh? What is this?

1:20:16.625 --> 1:20:17.426
Brilliant.
