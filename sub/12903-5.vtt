WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:05.771
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

00:05.773 --> 00:09.108
What do you know about
the hack into LAPD servers?

00:09.110 --> 00:11.477
I know as much as you do.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.678
Why don't I believe you?

00:12.680 --> 00:14.480
You're Internal Affairs, Liukin.

00:14.482 --> 00:18.450
You're never supposed
to believe a word a cop says.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.818
Nice suit, by the way.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.387
Thanks.

00:22.189 --> 00:26.091
So, a list of every adulterer
in Mayor Perry's administration

00:26.093 --> 00:27.659
was published from
the LAPD servers,

00:27.661 --> 00:30.462
followed by a message that says,
"Hi, Angie,"

00:30.464 --> 00:32.430
and you know nothing about it?

00:32.433 --> 00:33.532
Exactly.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.167
See you at the Christmas party.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.635
Sit down, Tribeca!

00:36.637 --> 00:37.503
So, which is it?

00:37.505 --> 00:38.604
You have it out for Mayor Perry,

00:38.606 --> 00:41.473
or you just have a ton
of money on Councilman Dreyfuss

00:41.475 --> 00:42.107
to win the election?

00:42.109 --> 00:44.143
If I had a ton of money,
I'd buy you a new suit.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.845
You think you're so clever.
But guess what...

00:46.847 --> 00:50.149
You're riding a desk till I
figure out what's going on here.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.618
And I'll be watching you...

00:52.620 --> 00:55.821
Every move you make.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.958
Tribeca?

00:59.960 --> 01:02.694
Tribeca?!

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.773 --> 01:14.773
Did you spend the night here?

01:15.242 --> 01:17.676
Desk duty just means
you can't take cases.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.845
It doesn't mean
you stay at your desk.

01:19.847 --> 01:20.779
I know that, Geils.

01:20.781 --> 01:21.814
I just want to figure out

01:21.816 --> 01:24.216
what the hell Mayhem Global is
and what they want from me.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.218
Just tell Internal Affairs
everything you know.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.220
They had someone at the FBI...
You don't think

01:28.222 --> 01:31.090
they might have someone
<i>inside</i> Internal Affairs?

01:31.092 --> 01:32.825
<i>Internal</i> Internal Affairs?

01:32.827 --> 01:34.960
Tribeca,
you're just being paranoid.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.562
Who's in with the lieutenant?

01:36.564 --> 01:38.163
The mayor's campaign manager.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.165
Looks like he's
getting read the riot act.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.668
"Furthermore, anyone in
a group of 12 or more"

01:42.670 --> 01:44.169
that is not
dispersed after an hour

01:44.171 --> 01:46.839
"has committed a felony
punishable by death."

01:46.841 --> 01:47.906
Look, the mayor has to believe

01:47.908 --> 01:50.042
we had nothing to do with
releasing that information,

01:50.044 --> 01:51.043
and that we are trying hard...

01:51.045 --> 01:52.811
I don't want to hear what
you're trying to do!

01:52.813 --> 01:55.981
I just want to hear your plan.

01:55.983 --> 01:56.849
First, we are...

01:56.851 --> 01:58.884
Save it...
I got to figure out a way

01:58.886 --> 02:01.720
to get an unpopular incumbent
with a terrible record

02:01.722 --> 02:02.721
elected for a second term.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.991
Now, thanks to your department,
I got a sex scandal on my hands.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.326
The mayor should have
thought of that

02:07.328 --> 02:08.759
before he cheated on his wife.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.661
You take that back!

02:09.663 --> 02:11.697
Find out who's trying to
sabotage the mayor's campaign.

02:11.699 --> 02:15.134
Anything you find,
you bring to me and <i> me</i> only.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.568
What's the best number...

02:16.570 --> 02:19.371
Not another word!

02:21.775 --> 02:23.575
Geils, Tribec...

02:24.945 --> 02:25.644
Geils.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.180
Triple homicide,
possible cult connections.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.115
Take Tanner and Hoffman
with you.

02:31.919 --> 02:32.918
I'm sorry, Tribeca.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.153
Internal Affairs has me
by the nuts.

02:34.155 --> 02:38.257
"Buy your own nuts,"
I always say, but what can I do?

02:38.259 --> 02:41.827
They have me by the balls.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.555
This isn't my chair.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.297
Your chair-stealing days
are over, scumbag!

03:18.299 --> 03:20.999
You're never <i>at</i> your desk!

03:21.001 --> 03:23.001
It's wasted on you!

03:23.003 --> 03:25.804
Tribeca, knock it off!

03:38.252 --> 03:40.285
Dr. Edelweiss?

03:40.287 --> 03:44.089
Tribeca, how are you doing?
What's new?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.390
Just bored. Desk duty.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.292
Yes, I heard. Sorry about that.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.061
Any cool deaths or anything?

03:49.063 --> 03:51.630
No, just Agnes here.
102 years old.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.198
Nothing attractive about her.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.099
Murdered?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.334
Fell down a staircase.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.034
Bummer.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.904
Wait, didn't another accidental
fall come in a couple days ago?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.405
I'm afraid you're
going further back

04:00.407 --> 04:03.041
than this old
meat computer can calculate.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.810
All right,
I'll check the records room.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.613
Thanks, Doc. See you around.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.717
And Doctor?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.753
I-I told you,
I don't remember anything.

04:19.192 --> 04:19.992
Hello.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.827
How can I help you today,
young lady?

04:21.829 --> 04:24.363
I'm looking for a case file
from a couple days ago.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.265
Well, you've come
to the right place.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.800
You know, history is
one of our... Grandpa!

04:28.802 --> 04:32.671
Hey, Tribeca, sorry.
It's his birthday.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.673
He wanted to see where I work.

04:34.675 --> 04:35.340
What can I get you?

04:35.342 --> 04:38.844
It's from a couple days ago...
Accidental fall, elderly man.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.313
Hold on one second.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.186
Here it is...
Doug Warren, 99 years old.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.821
You think it was a homicide?

04:49.823 --> 04:50.389
It could be.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.158
Then I can't give it to you.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.394
They sent out a memo saying
you weren't allowed

04:55.396 --> 04:57.129
to investigate
any more homicide cases.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.931
It's... not a homicide.
I was just kidding.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.801
Good one. Here you go.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.735
Thanks.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.469
Now, in 1954...

05:04.471 --> 05:08.373
Grandpa, no one cares
that you were blacklisted.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.263
You working a case?

05:31.265 --> 05:35.233
Nope. Just getting a mop.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.712
Nice try.

06:15.109 --> 06:16.375
All right, look alive.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.977
I think this is where
the cult leader lives.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.712
You think?

06:30.924 --> 06:31.990
Tribeca, can I call you back?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.892
Geils, you will not believe
what I just found.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.293
<i>Just, like, 5 minutes.</i>

06:35.295 --> 06:36.595
Well, it'll only take a second.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.331
I can't talk right now.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.341
Tribeca, I can't talk, neither.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.887
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.797
Thanks, Mark.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.965
Now we're even.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.773
Yeah, we're all safe here.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.108
Hoffman was incredible.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.009
He busted down the door,

07:24.011 --> 07:26.778
disarmed 12 men,
and rescued 5 hostages.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.780
Tanner, don't drink that!

07:28.982 --> 07:32.417
Man, I brought that from home!

07:33.086 --> 07:34.619
I need you to pay a visit
to Peter Warren.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.856
His grandfather died six days
ago from a fall down the stairs.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.592
You almost got us killed
so I could comfort a guy

07:40.594 --> 07:41.726
who lost his grandfather?

07:41.728 --> 07:43.061
<i>It's not just him.</i>

07:43.063 --> 07:44.129
There's three other incidents

07:44.131 --> 07:46.965
of senior citizens falling down
the stairs in the last month.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.901
Geils, please. Old people are dying.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.102
Would you listen to yourself?

07:51.104 --> 07:54.406
<i>"Geils, please.
Old people are dying."</i>

07:55.075 --> 07:56.007
Is that what I sound like?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.943
Angie, I know it's frustrating
being chained to a desk,

07:57.945 --> 08:01.613
but you can't start chasing
murders that aren't there.

08:01.615 --> 08:05.650
Geils, if you have
a shred of feeling left for me,

08:05.652 --> 08:06.751
you'll do this.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.819
That is so unfair.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.154
Okay, well, if you don't do it,

08:09.156 --> 08:11.056
then you hate me,
and you hope I'll die.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.725
That's just crossing a line.
You got to go.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.394
<i>Liukin is coming.</i>

08:44.057 --> 08:44.956
Can I help you?

08:44.958 --> 08:47.526
Peter Warren? Jay Geils, LAPD.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.160
LAPD? What's this about?

08:49.162 --> 08:50.929
I feel a bit ridiculous
even saying this,

08:50.931 --> 08:51.997
but I have a couple questions

08:51.999 --> 08:55.467
concerning the death of
your grandfather, Doug Warren.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.001
Doug Warren?

08:56.003 --> 09:00.071
Wow. That's a name I haven't
heard in... six days.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.072
What's going on, honey?

09:01.074 --> 09:04.843
This detective
is asking about Doug Warren.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.777
Your grandfather?

09:05.779 --> 09:08.013
You know he died six days ago.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.282
Yeah, I know,
I'm glad you guys remember him.

09:10.284 --> 09:14.920
Sorry to dredge up the past,
but do you mind if I come in?

09:17.824 --> 09:19.691
Most of his stuff was long gone,

09:19.693 --> 09:24.095
but I found one
that fell behind the desk.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.131
Wow. You look so young.

09:26.133 --> 09:30.769
Yeah. I don't know what I was
thinking with that haircut.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.940
If you think back, was there anything
unusual about the way he passed away?

09:34.942 --> 09:35.707
Boy, boy,

09:35.709 --> 09:39.244
I can barely remember two weeks
ago, let alone six days.

09:39.246 --> 09:39.978
Honey?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.846
It was late afternoon.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.816
We'd gone grocery shopping,
and when we got back,

09:44.818 --> 09:49.321
he was lying at the bottom of
the stairs, dead as a doornail.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.422
Is that right, honey?

09:50.424 --> 09:53.224
Sounds right, but honestly,
it's <i> really</i> murky.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.494
Mind if I take
a look at his room?

09:58.865 --> 10:00.131
We turned it into a gym.

10:00.133 --> 10:04.903
Must have been two,
three days ago.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.571
Can you give me a minute, Pete?

10:06.573 --> 10:10.141
It's "Peter," but go ahead.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.680
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.293
Well, you busted
the case wide open, Tribeca.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.327
Are you being sarcastic?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.129
No, I'm being serious.
Crime of the century.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.232
Old man falls down the stairs,
dies, call the newspaper.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.569
Are you serious? 'Cause it's ringing now.

10:37.571 --> 10:41.539
Next time you want to send
someone on a wild goose chase,

10:41.541 --> 10:44.042
call Detective Garrity.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.612
You used my feelings for you
to get me to do your dirty work.

10:47.614 --> 10:52.751
Well, here you go...
Souvenir from the deceased.

10:53.787 --> 10:57.922
<i>I'm sorry, the mailbox</i>
<i>for the</i> L.A. Times <i> is full.</i>

11:12.973 --> 11:14.939
They were all Perry donors.

11:14.941 --> 11:15.907
Who were all Perry donors?

11:15.909 --> 11:18.743
I know I'm on desk duty, but
I've spent the day investigating

11:18.745 --> 11:21.046
what I believe to be
a series of connected murders.

11:21.048 --> 11:24.082
If this is a joke, Tribeca,
it's one of your best ones.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.451
It's based in truth,
but ultimately absurd.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.186
Someone is killing
senior citizens

11:28.188 --> 11:29.654
by pushing them down the stairs.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.356
You just topped it.
I don't know how you did it.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.792
I'm having Dr. Edelweiss
re-autopsy all the...

11:33.794 --> 11:34.793
Are you insane, Tribeca?

11:34.795 --> 11:38.363
You're investigating the deaths
of hundred-year-old people?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.799
Not deaths... <i>murders</i>...
And get this...

11:40.801 --> 11:42.133
They were <i> all</i>
Mayor Perry donors.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.035
What else did you find out?
Their hair was white?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.838
They smelled like soup?
They were set in their ways?

11:46.840 --> 11:49.340
I checked the campaign
finance data,

11:49.342 --> 11:52.243
and combined,
they gave over $200,000.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.012
I am gonna say this once...

11:54.014 --> 11:55.046
Stand down. Stand down.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.148
What if this is somehow
linked to Councilman Dreyfuss?

11:57.150 --> 12:00.618
What if Mayhem Global is somehow
involved in this? What if...

12:00.620 --> 12:02.220
What if, what if, what if?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.889
Your "what ifs" are gonna
cost me my job and my pension.

12:04.891 --> 12:09.160
I have $80,000 into a boat
with <i> major</i> plumbing problems,

12:09.162 --> 12:11.863
and you're drumming up
political scandals

12:11.865 --> 12:14.199
based on dead old people?

12:14.201 --> 12:18.036
Now, I don't want to hear
another word.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.438
Smigmo.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.441
You got a lot of nerve, Tribeca.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.811
This is a complete
violation of my...

12:32.219 --> 12:33.918
Tribeca.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.855
I'll be there as soon as I can.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.343
What do you have for me?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.745
I think something you'll
find quite illuminating.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.948
We re-autopsied all
the bodies of elderly people

13:03.950 --> 13:05.416
who met their demise by a fall.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.219
Cursory examination revealed
no signs of foul play,

13:08.221 --> 13:11.189
no struggle, no defensive
wounds, no bruising.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.056
What? No bruising?

13:12.058 --> 13:13.458
But these people
fell down the stairs.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.994
And were killed instantly,
no less.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.095
I'm afraid you've lost me.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.031
Bruising can only occur when
the heart is still beating.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.366
Okay, so...?

13:21.368 --> 13:24.869
So, if we could get
their hearts beating again,

13:24.871 --> 13:27.906
what could that reveal?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.274
I don't know, but I'm riveted.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.076
Please tell me more
without delay.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.955
Now, if only we could get Agnes
here's heart beating again...

13:43.957 --> 13:45.323
We could see what
the bruising pattern

13:45.325 --> 13:46.925
would have been after her fall.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.326
Sounds like reanimation.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.328
Are we crossing
an ethical line here?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.563
Not in my opinion, but, then,

13:51.565 --> 13:54.465
I'm still not allowed back
in my native Britain.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.234
But now using
a lawnmower engine,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.870
a bicycle pump,
and some pool noodles...

13:58.872 --> 13:59.938
By the way, Dr. Scholls,

13:59.940 --> 14:02.207
thank you very much for
helping me clear out my shed...

14:02.209 --> 14:05.176
We've created an artificial
pumping mechanism

14:05.178 --> 14:09.180
that will recirculate Agnes'
blood throughout her body.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.182
Dr. Scholls, if you would?

14:20.560 --> 14:21.993
Breathtaking, isn't it?

14:21.995 --> 14:24.329
Live, live, damn you!

14:27.133 --> 14:29.267
Sorry.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.239
My God. She was pushed.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.846
I know what you're gonna say.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.581
"Drop it. Let it go.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.583
Just come out already.
It gets better."

14:45.585 --> 14:47.218
But we have a case here.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.221
Someone is pushing Mayor Perry's
donors down the stairs,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.490
but because they're old,
no one looks into it.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.791
But guess what...
I looked into it.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.526
And it turns out,
someone is pushing.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.161
Mayor Perry's donors
down the stairs.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.930
But because they're old,
no one looks into it.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.465
But guess what...
I looked into it...

15:00.467 --> 15:03.268
I'm gonna stop you right there.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.302
I believe you.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.804
The way I treated you,
you have no reason to.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.705
Yeah, you're right,

15:07.707 --> 15:12.477
but in the end, you're a great
cop with great instincts.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.878
What do you want us to do?

15:13.880 --> 15:16.881
Geils, go talk to Bob Terrier,
Perry's campaign manager.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.517
Is he aware of any of this?
Is he alarmed by it?

15:19.519 --> 15:21.419
Get a list of his top donors.

15:21.421 --> 15:21.786
Copy.

15:21.788 --> 15:26.658
Tanner, this case just came in.
Herschel Potomac, 102.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.926
Fell down a set of stairs.

15:27.928 --> 15:28.793
I'll check it out.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.828
Now, technically, you guys
could get in big trouble

15:30.830 --> 15:32.630
because I'm not
supposed to be doing this.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.300
So, if for any reason
you want to back out,

15:35.302 --> 15:39.737
I will be very mad at you and
not talk to you for a long time.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.273
Let's go.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.445
When we got home,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.580
he was lying dead
at the bottom of the stairs.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.350
And you say he was
a Mayor Perry supporter?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.552
Yes.
His campaign manager came out

15:54.554 --> 15:57.455
to thank Grandpa personally,
and now he's gone.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.790
Well, maybe you can find comfort

15:58.792 --> 16:01.626
in knowing that your grandfather
died with dignity,

16:01.628 --> 16:04.495
and now he's in a better place.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.298
You guys have any gas?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.735
This is just devastating news,
Detective, just devastating.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.870
Our donors are the ones
that give us our money.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.439
I know that
sounds counterintuitive,

16:14.441 --> 16:16.774
but that's just the way
it's always been for us.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.076
How well did you get to know
the victims?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.645
Well, I didn't know
any of them personally.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.713
There's so many supporters,

16:21.715 --> 16:23.614
you never get a chance
to meet them all.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.782
Maybe I got this wrong,

16:24.784 --> 16:26.484
but according to
the families of the deceased,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.987
you met with each of the donors
at one time or the other.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.688
Yeah. That's what I said.
I met them all.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.991
Okay, right. So you did meet
with Herschel Potomac,

16:32.993 --> 16:35.426
Doug Warren, and Agnes Scavelli?

16:35.428 --> 16:37.795
None of those names
mean anything to me.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.397
Can I help you
with anything else, detective?

16:39.399 --> 16:42.433
My staff and I have got
a lot of work to get to tonight.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.369
Of course.

16:52.379 --> 16:58.049
Yes? Dr. Edelweiss.
Would you mind coming up here?

16:58.051 --> 17:02.754
Okay, I'll come down.

17:05.959 --> 17:06.958
Yes, Doctor?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.425
I would have come up!

17:08.428 --> 17:11.061
I found something
rather interesting

17:11.064 --> 17:13.531
on the victim's back.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.265
A ring.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.099
Anything on it
to tie it to somebody?

17:16.102 --> 17:19.037
Just the initials. "R.T."

17:20.773 --> 17:21.973
Ralph Taters.

17:21.974 --> 17:22.874
Ruby Tuesday.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.108
Rocky Tarantula.

17:24.109 --> 17:25.443
Russell Tover.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.278
My God.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.982
Here... souvenir
from the deceased.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.518
Who's in with the lieutenant?

17:33.520 --> 17:36.421
The mayor's campaign manager.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.089
This is gorgeous.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.857
"R.T." What's that stand for?

17:39.859 --> 17:40.525
"Ralph Taters"?

17:40.527 --> 17:44.128
"Ruby Tuesday"?
"Rocky Tarantula"?

17:44.130 --> 17:48.066
Robert Terrier. Bob Terrier.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.333
Geils.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.440
Lieutenant?
Can you come down to forensics?

17:55.442 --> 17:59.343
Yes, I'll come up.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.912
Thank you.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.516
Cheerio.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.088
What is it, Tribeca?
I would have come down.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.290
Bob Terrier's killing
Mayor Perry's donors.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.624
Don't ask me why,
because I don't know,

18:13.626 --> 18:18.096
but Geils is with him right now,
and he's in danger.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.667
Internal Affairs
is gonna have my ass for this.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.602
Not so fast, Lieutenant Atkins!

18:24.604 --> 18:27.572
For God's sakes, Liukin!
I've got a detective in danger.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.273
You cut her loose,
she'll be setting in motion

18:29.275 --> 18:33.277
a bureaucratic process that
could take months to resolve.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.814
I'll take that chance.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.155
Go get 'em.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.991
Got it, Lieutenant.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.993
The one thing I can't figure out

18:48.995 --> 18:51.529
is why there's lines
through these names

18:51.531 --> 18:53.297
as if someone's
crossing them out.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.032
Look, if you're gonna
keep me here all night,

18:55.034 --> 18:56.400
let's at least get some coffee.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.435
The machine's upstairs.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.369
No, thanks. I'm good.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.038
I'm telling you, the coffee
upstairs is really excellent.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.240
All right. Grab me a cup, then.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.542
Well, there's lots of flavors.
You got to come up and choose.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.477
Just name them,
and I'll pick one.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.645
There's, like, 50 kinds.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.946
Whatever you're having is fine.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.515
I was gonna have tea. Tea works.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.150
There's even more kinds of tea.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.951
Would you please
just come upstairs

19:13.953 --> 19:17.021
and select what kind
of hot beverage you want?

19:17.023 --> 19:20.057
Fine.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.227
You know what? It's gonna keep
me up. I'll just hydrate.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.629
There's a water cooler
right there.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.497
Get up the stairs!
Get up the stairs!

19:26.499 --> 19:27.498
What is wrong with you?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.066
Why is it so important
that I go upstairs?

19:29.068 --> 19:32.069
Because he wants
to push you down them!

19:32.071 --> 19:32.570
Tribeca!

19:32.572 --> 19:34.238
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
It's just upstairs.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.974
Your days of pushing people
down the stairs are over.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.044
He's the one who's been
murdering all the donors, Geils.

19:40.046 --> 19:43.181
I bet there's not
even coffee up there!

19:43.183 --> 19:44.448
We found
the imprint of your ring

19:44.450 --> 19:46.050
on the back
of the elderly victims.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.019
The only question
I have left is "Why?"

19:48.021 --> 19:49.487
You're Perry's campaign manager.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.923
Why would you
kill all his donors?

19:53.226 --> 19:55.326
You don't even
work for Perry, do you?

19:55.328 --> 19:57.028
You work for somebody else.

19:57.030 --> 20:01.065
Clever, Detective.
Good luck finding out who.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.634
He has an ID card
from Mayhem Global.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.604
Damn it. I hate that photo.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.471
Let's go, Terrier.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.706
One cup of Joe,
that's all I'm saying.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.310
The only Joe you'll be cupping
is the prison warden.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.279
Get him out of here.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.654
Are you coming?

20:23.656 --> 20:26.257
Yeah.
