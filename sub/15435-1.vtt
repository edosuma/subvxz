WEBVTT

00:02.755 --> 00:05.500
I'M A VERY TRADITIONAL PERSON.
JUMPING YOUR BONES WAS

00:05.501 --> 00:08.416
EXTREMELY ATYPICAL FOR ME.
WELL, I COULD USE   SOME TRADITION IN MY LIFE.

00:08.420 --> 00:11.303
ARE YOU RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
WELL, YES, I AM, MS. WALKER.

00:11.310 --> 00:13.239
WE'VE BEEN HAVING
 SOME GROWN-UP PROBLEMS.

00:13.649 --> 00:15.649
  ARE YOU GETTING A DIVORCE?

00:15.746 --> 00:18.356
WILLIAM'S ORGANS ARE FAILING.
 HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

00:18.550 --> 00:20.099
 ONE DAY WE'LL TELL YOU
  ABOUT YOUR BROTHER

00:20.100 --> 00:21.316
  AND HOW MUCH WE LOVED HIM.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.493
I CAN'T ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSAL
UNTIL YOU ACCEPT MINE.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.300
HOW'S REBECCA? SAUL JUST TOLD ME
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN KEEPING HER.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.186
  MY MOTHER AND I HAVE
  A VERY COMPLEXELATIONSHIP.

00:32.189 --> 00:34.390
  WHEN I SAID YOU WERE WELCOME
 HERE LIKE FAMILY, I MEANT THAT.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.773
I'M GONNA BE JUST AS BRAVE  AS YOU ARE.
I LOVE YOU.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.595
 IS THIS THING WORKING?
 OH. OH, WAIT.

00:44.564 --> 00:45.144
 THERE.

00:45.634 --> 00:48.691
HI. HI, JUSTIN.
  IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

00:49.368 --> 00:51.711
  BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS,
  THEN YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY.

00:52.318 --> 00:54.946
UM, ANYWAY, HOW ARE YOU?

00:55.344 --> 00:57.624
  IT'S BEEN A WHILE
  SINCE I'VE HEARD FROM YOU.

00:58.677 --> 00:59.611
  IT'S JUST LIKE THAT SUMMER

00:59.615 --> 01:01.915
 YOU WENT AWAY
  TO CAMP LACKAWANNA--

01:02.900 --> 01:05.480
NOT THAT CAMLACKAWANNA
IS ANYTHING LIKE IRAQ--

01:05.486 --> 01:06.500
  BUT YOU WERE AWAY
  FOR EIGHT WEEKS,

01:06.504 --> 01:08.245
  AND I NEVER HEARD
A SINGLE WORD FROM YOU.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.339
 DON'T YOU ROLL
YOUR EYES AT ME.

01:11.824 --> 01:14.169
 MATERNAL GUILT
  IS WHAT I DO BEST...

01:15.600 --> 01:18.625
 NOT THAT IT'S WORKED VERY WELL
  WITH ANY OF YOUR SIBLINGS.

01:18.634 --> 01:20.789
  I'VE... I'VE BARELY
 SEEN THEM ALL SUMMER.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.600
 SARAH HAS A LOT ON HER PLATE.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.207
  SHE AND JOE
  ARE STILL SEPARATED.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.800
  BUT SHE SAYS
 THEY'RE GETTING ALONG,

01:25.801 --> 01:29.900
 AND I KNOW SHE'S HAPPY SPENDING   
MORE TIME WITH THE KIDS.
THINK I SHOULD GET   A MOMMY JOB?

01:30.100 --> 01:31.365
IS THAT LIKE A PART-TIME JOB?

01:33.140 --> 01:36.299
MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY,
 MOMMY, I'M THIRSTY.

01:36.300 --> 01:40.087
HONEY, DO WE HAVE TO WHINE?
  HERE.

01:40.663 --> 01:41.767
YOU WANT ONE, SWEETIE?

01:41.947 --> 01:45.180
 OOH, SORRY. WE DON'T DO
 PROCESSED FOODS.

01:45.876 --> 01:47.366
NO OFFENSE, I KNOW YOU WORK.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.700
  SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I NEED TO MAKE A CALL.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.334
AND KEN--OH, MY GOD,
EVER SINCE HE'S BEEN DATING

01:53.337 --> 01:56.620
THAT JASON McCALLISTER,
HE'S BARELY RECOGNIZABLE.

01:56.633 --> 01:59.450
 JASON HAS BEEN
 SUCH A GOOD INFLUENCE ON HIM.

01:59.451 --> 02:02.467
   I THINK HE'S REALLY
   BEEN GROWING SPIRITUALLY.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.306
THINGS YOU WANT
  GOD TO DO FOR YOU.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.900
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

02:07.901 --> 02:11.392
If you don't talk to me, I might murder someone.
 WHERE ARE YOU?

02:11.628 --> 02:14.847
  IN A PARK WITH THE MOST
COMPETITIVE MOMS IN AMERICA.

02:15.308 --> 02:17.000
  WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M IN CHURCH,

02:17.005 --> 02:19.612
AND REVEREND BOYFRIEND'S GIVING
 ME THE EVIL EYE. I GOTTA GO.

02:20.185 --> 02:22.808
...BECAUSE PRAYER IS A GIFT.
AMEN.

02:22.815 --> 02:25.448
 MMY'S GOT HIS HANDS FULL
WITH THE WINERY AND THE BABY,

02:25.455 --> 02:26.811
BUT IT'S SO EXCITING--

02:27.000 --> 02:28.746
 ELIZABETH FINALLY CAME HOME.

02:29.336 --> 02:30.137
   I OFFERED TO HELP,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.083
 BUT TOMMY SAYS  JULIA'S DOING FINE.

02:32.363 --> 02:34.833
  I GUESS SHE'S JUST THRILLED TO BE NESTING.
MORNING.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.173
OH, HEY, GOOD, GOOD.
 YOU'RE UP.

02:37.876 --> 02:40.523
  HERE. TODAY'S THE PITCH
TO PRIMARY FOODS. I GOTTA GO.

02:40.756 --> 02:43.609
 GIVE ME A KISS. MWAH.
WISH ME LUCK, ALL RIGHT?

02:43.740 --> 02:45.096
 GOOD LUCK, HON.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.300
  WHAT ELSE? OH, YES,
 KITTY AND ROBERT.

02:49.304 --> 02:50.923
   THEY'RE SO BUSY CAMPAIGNING

02:51.404 --> 02:52.804
  THAT KITTY CAN'T MAKE IT HOME
  FOR HER BIRTHDAY...

02:52.810 --> 02:55.571
   WHicH I'M ACTUALLY
 KIND OF RELIEVED ABOUT,

02:55.814 --> 02:56.944
 BEING THAT IT'S ALSO

02:56.950 --> 02:58.830
 THE ANNIVERSARY
OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.357
WELL, SENATOR McCALLISTER, UH,
 YOU NOW HAVE

03:01.367 --> 03:03.657
A FUTURE BROTHER-IN-LAW
  SERVING IN IRAQ.

03:03.927 --> 03:07.350
HAS THAT CHANGED YOUR FEELINGS
  OR BELIEFS ABOUT THIS WAR?

03:07.401 --> 03:08.187
 NOT AT ALL.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.767
THAT KITTY'S BROTHER JUSTIN
  IS BRAVELY SERVING HIS COUNTRY

03:11.770 --> 03:13.105
DOES MAKE IT HIT
 CLOSER TO HOME,

03:13.337 --> 03:15.547
BUT FOR A PRESIDENT,
 IT SHOULD.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.994
  HERE'S ONE FOR YOU, KITTY.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.489
  HAVE YOU PICKED OUT
A WEDDING DRESS?

03:22.279 --> 03:25.349
  TO BE HONEST, I...
I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME.

03:25.852 --> 03:29.015
  I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW OUR
FIRST PRIORITY IS THE CAMPAIGN.

03:29.923 --> 03:31.866
  ODDLY, THE ONLY ONE
  OF YOUR SIBLINGS

03:31.870 --> 03:33.636
   I'VE SPENT ANY TIME WITH
  IS REBECCA.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.770
SHE'S STILL NOT TALKING
   TO HER MOM.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.296
   AND YOU WERE RIGHT,
   SHE'S WONDERFUL.

03:39.740 --> 03:41.174
  SHE'S SENDING YOU
 A CARE PACKAGE,

03:41.175 --> 03:44.414
   EVERYTHING YOU ASKED FOR,
  PLUS A LITTLE TASTE OF HOME.

03:45.249 --> 03:46.542
  I KNOW YOU'RE TERRIBLY BUSY,

03:46.555 --> 03:50.096
  BUT WHEN YOU CAN,
 JUST LET ME KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.

03:51.174 --> 03:52.528
  I LOVE YOU, JUSTIN.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.634
  WE ALL DO.
PLEASE BE SAFE.

04:03.632 --> 04:04.466
PLEASE.

04:08.300 --> 04:08.966
 AND NOW

04:08.970 --> 04:10.470
   TO OUR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
  WITH PRESIDENTIAL...

04:10.471 --> 04:13.304
  OH. OH, WAIT, WAIT.
THE--THE INTERVIEW IS ON.

04:13.305 --> 04:15.938
WE'LL MULTITASK.
  OH, YOU WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO ME

04:15.940 --> 04:17.807
WHILE WE'RE WATCHING
  OURSELVES ON TV?

04:17.810 --> 04:18.370
  TOO KINKY?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.500
WELL, I AM YOUR
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR,

04:21.507 --> 04:24.293
AND I HAVE TO CRITIQUE  YOUR PERFORMANCE.
  HOW AM I DOING SO FAR?

04:24.296 --> 04:28.123
IN IRAQ?
UGH. OH, I HATE IT. I HATE IT
  WHEN THEY BRING UP JUSTIN.

04:28.126 --> 04:31.963
 HERE'S ONE FOR YOU, KITTY...
  OH, AND COME ON. COME ON,
ENOUGH WITH THE WEDDING DRESS.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.806
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
  WITH CAMPAIGN ISSUES?

04:34.300 --> 04:36.000
  OH, WE GET
 FIVE MINUTES ALONE,

04:36.001 --> 04:37.600
  AND ALL YOU WANT TO DO
IS YELL AT THE TV.

04:37.605 --> 04:39.805
THE MINUTE THE PRESS FOUND OUT
THAT WE WERE ENGAGED,

04:39.811 --> 04:42.111
I WENT FROM BEING A KEY PLAYER
  IN YOUR CAMPAIGN

04:42.112 --> 04:44.052
TO BEING NOTHING MORE
 THAN YOUR FIANCEE.

04:44.800 --> 04:49.299
  I MEAN, EVEN THE WORD IS
JUST... IRRITATING. "FIANCEE."

04:49.300 --> 04:51.965
  FIRST FIANCEE.
  AND YOU KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

04:51.966 --> 04:54.299
  WELL, OF COURSE I DID,
BUT IT'S STILL INFURIATING

04:54.300 --> 04:55.699
THAT PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO BE

04:55.700 --> 04:58.033
 THIS PERFECT LITTLE
WIFE-IN-TRAINING WHO--

04:58.200 --> 05:02.587
WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT COOKIES
AND--AND BABIES AND SHOPPING.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.800
A-AND BELIEVE ME,
I DO CARE ABOUT BABIES...

05:06.000 --> 05:07.026
AND COOKIES...

05:08.500 --> 05:10.503
AND I COULD GO EITHER WAY
ON THE SHOPPING.

05:10.932 --> 05:11.599
  REALLY?

05:12.233 --> 05:13.925
MY POINT IS, IS THAT...

05:14.626 --> 05:16.082
  I DON'T KNOW,
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THIS

05:16.259 --> 05:18.771
HIGH-POWERED WORKING WOMAN BOX,

05:18.800 --> 05:21.351
AND THEN THERE'S
THIS FIANCee/WIFE BOX...

05:22.657 --> 05:23.458
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
 HOW TO FIT

05:23.624 --> 05:25.174
  IN BOTH BOXES
AT THE SAME TIME.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.273
  MAYBE YOU SHOULD
 TAKE SOME TIME OFF.

05:28.801 --> 05:31.300
HMM. THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION,

05:31.305 --> 05:35.110
JUST TAKE THE WORKING WOMAN
  BOX AND--AND CRUSH IT?

05:35.872 --> 05:36.802
   NO, THE FACT IS..

05:36.803 --> 05:38.773
  LOOK...
   IS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
 WITH POLITICS ALMOST...

05:40.103 --> 05:42.026
  I KNOW HOW STRESSFUL
  IT'S BEEN WITHOUT JUSTIN,

05:42.502 --> 05:45.285
  AND NOW YOUR BIRTHDAY
  AND YOUR DAD.

05:45.542 --> 05:48.286
  NO. NO, ROBERT,
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

05:50.346 --> 05:52.746
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I DON'T
  THINK ANYBODY WOULD BLAME YOU

05:52.750 --> 05:54.008
  IF YOU WANTED SOME TIME AWAY.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.500
OH. OH, WELL, GEE,
THANK YOU, HONEY,

05:58.505 --> 06:00.360
FOR LETTING ME KNOW
WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.490
  I'M NOT GETTIN' ANY, AM I?

06:04.800 --> 06:07.542
I SAID I WOULDN'T PANIC
 UNTIL IT WAS 21 DAYS.

06:07.550 --> 06:09.413
WELL, IT'S BEEN 21 DAYS,
  AND I HAVEN'T HEARD

06:09.414 --> 06:12.971
A SINGLE THING FROM HIM.
  Come on, Nora, that's a completely arbitrary number.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.281
  WE ALL KNEW THAT
THERE WOULD BE TIMES

06:15.300 --> 06:18.100
when Justin would be   out of touch.
  IT'S A MOTHER'S INTUITION.

06:18.104 --> 06:21.803
  NORA, HE'LL CALL. I PROMISE YOU, HE WILL CALL.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

06:22.870 --> 06:25.064
  WELL, SWEETHEART, YOU DO HAVE
  A CONNECTION WITH THE SENATE.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.700
A LOT OF GOOD THAT'S DONE ME.

06:26.701 --> 06:28.700
  KITTY HAS NOT DONE
ONE DAMN THING TO HELP,

06:28.701 --> 06:30.700
EXCEPT TALK ABOUT HER BROTHER
  ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

06:30.701 --> 06:35.167
DID YOU SEE THAT INTERVIEW?
  Nora, to be fair,  they were asked.

06:35.168 --> 06:36.701
THEY COULD HAVE SAID
"NO COMMENT"

06:36.705 --> 06:39.033
  INSTEAD OF JUMPING
ALL OVER IT AND USING HIM

06:39.040 --> 06:40.339
AS SOME SORT OF POLITICAL
 SELLING POINT.

06:40.340 --> 06:43.297
I HAD TO TURN IT OFF. I CAN'T
  EVEN BEAR TO LOOK AT HER.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.040
 Nora?

06:50.566 --> 06:51.573
  NORA, WHAT IS IT?

06:54.327 --> 06:55.480
SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.775
OH, GOD. WHAT IF THIS IS THEM?
WHAT IF THIS IS ABOUT JUSTIN?

07:02.100 --> 07:04.740
Please, please don't
do this to yourself.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.556
 IT'S PROBABLY
  JUST THE POSTMAN.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.977
NO, HE'S ALREADY BEEN HERE.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.000
 I'll stay on the phone,
  okay?

07:12.400 --> 07:14.107
  JUST ANSWER THE DOOR.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.090
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN.

07:20.601 --> 07:21.987
YOU HAVE TO.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.476
  Go ahead. I'm right here.

07:27.100 --> 07:27.784
OKAY.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.167
OKAY. STAY ON THE PHONE.

片名 第2季第1集</font>

08:06.129 --> 08:07.959
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
  MAILED HER PRESENT.

08:08.252 --> 08:10.802
NOW I'M GONNA LOOK  LIKE A SCHMUCK.
AT LEAST YOU'RE NOTSLEEPING IN HER BED.

08:11.152 --> 08:14.022
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR HER BIRTHDAY?
  KITTY SAYS NO FUSS THIS YEAR.

08:14.552 --> 08:17.653
SINCE WHEN DO YOU LISTEN TO KITTY?
 WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER OUT FOR DINNER?

08:17.666 --> 08:19.686
 OH, YEAH, GOOD LUCK GETTING
A RESERVATION SOMEWHERE DECENT

08:19.690 --> 08:22.022
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.
OH, I KNOW A REALLY GOOD  MEXICAN PLACE

08:22.023 --> 08:26.854
ACROSS FROM THE PANTAGES  IN HOLLYWOOD.
I LOVE THAT PLACE. I GO THERE  EVERY TIME I SEE "WICKED."

08:26.860 --> 08:28.000
  YEAH.
IT'S ALWAYS PACKED, THOUGH.

08:28.003 --> 08:31.469
  WELL, I KNOW THE HOSTESS.
I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD RESPECT KITTY'S WISHES.

08:31.496 --> 08:34.937
  SHE WAS VERY ADAMANT.
WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY JUST
FEELING WEIRD BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

08:34.940 --> 08:37.129
  LAST YEAR
 AT THIS TIME... UM...

08:39.000 --> 08:40.400
  WHAT,
DAD TOOK THE FINAL PLUNGE

08:40.405 --> 08:42.933
WHILE SHE WAS BLOWING OUT  HER CANDLES?
KEVIN.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.273
YOU KNOW, IF I WERE HER, I'D BE
AFRAID TO CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY.

08:45.276 --> 08:48.400
MAYBE THERE'S A KITTY CURSE.
THE ONLY THING SHE'S CURSED WITH

08:48.410 --> 08:50.900
ARE HER INSANE POLITICS.
  I ARD THAT.

08:50.903 --> 08:53.743
 OH, SORRY.
HELLO, RIP VAN WINKLE.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.303
  HELLO.
WE WERE BEGINNING TO WONDER
  IF YOU WERE EVER GONNA GET UP.

08:56.310 --> 08:59.049
  OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, MOTHER,
  I HAD SOME TROUBLE SLEEPING.

08:59.176 --> 09:03.220
  THE... MATTRESS IN
 THE GUEST ROOM IS REALLY HARD.

09:03.646 --> 09:04.819
I'D BE HAPPY TO TRADE
  WITH YOU.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.429
  OH, NO. NO, NO. IT'S FINE.

09:09.126 --> 09:10.836
  WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE UP,
 WELCOME BACK.

09:11.193 --> 09:12.066
 I GOTTA GO.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.667
I'M SO MOVED.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.  BYE, ALL.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.377
 BYE!
  OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA GO MAKE A RESERVATION.

09:17.543 --> 09:19.362
OH, THANKS.

09:21.409 --> 09:23.975
  WOW, I SURE KNOW HOW
TO CLEAR A ROOM.

09:24.700 --> 09:25.523
  UH-HUH.

09:28.099 --> 09:30.823
  SO WHAT WAS THAT
ABOUT A RESERVATION?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.500
 OH, I TRIED TO TALK TO 'EM.

09:32.510 --> 09:33.477
THEY'RE INSISTING ON GETTING

09:33.700 --> 09:35.154
 THE FAMILY TOGETHER
  FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.223
OHH. OH.

09:38.116 --> 09:41.773
 YOU KNOW, UM,
WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE

09:42.149 --> 09:44.216
IS TO GO SHOPPING
 WITH MY MOTHER.

09:44.549 --> 09:47.755
  OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
  JUSTIN MIGHT CALL. SORRY.

09:47.849 --> 09:50.195
WELL, WE'LL HAVE
OUR CELL PHONES WITH US.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.449
I'LL TURN MINE ON LOUD.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.333
MOTHER!

09:54.350 --> 09:57.223
 WHAT?
I NEED A WEDDING DRESS.

09:57.321 --> 09:58.500
OH, YES, YOU DO.

09:58.501 --> 10:00.100
YEAH, YOU KNOW, SO THE--

10:00.101 --> 10:01.982
THE PRESS WILL STOP
OBSESSING ABOUT IT,

10:02.101 --> 10:03.916
AND THEY'LL START TALKING ABOUT
THINGS THAT ACTUALLY MATTER...

10:03.917 --> 10:05.894
 UH-HUH.
LIKE--LIKE, YOU KNOW,
HEALTH CARE.

10:08.826 --> 10:10.266
PLESAE

10:11.600 --> 10:12.520
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

10:15.377 --> 10:16.279
 I'D LOVE TO.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.500
  OH, COOP HAVE AN ACCIDENT?
JUICE BOX EXPLOSION.

10:19.503 --> 10:21.921
  I STABBED IT A LITTLE
AGGRESSIVELY WITH THE STRAW.

10:22.269 --> 10:23.886
IT WAS EITHER THAT
 OR MONICA'S EYE.

10:24.470 --> 10:25.900
  "WE DON'T DO PROCESSED FOODS."

10:25.907 --> 10:29.456
GOD, THAT IS PERFECT.
  MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

10:29.700 --> 10:32.216
SHE'S GOT A MASSEUSE NAMED TAD.
  OH, YEAH?

10:32.527 --> 10:35.327
GIVES HER A HAPPY ENDING.
GET OUT.

10:35.354 --> 10:37.000
  IT'S TRUE.
  SHUT UP!

10:37.000 --> 10:38.188
  YEAH!
  WHAT ELSE YOU GOT FOR ME?

10:38.333 --> 10:41.700
 UM, AMY'S HAD TWO MOMMY JOBS.

10:41.710 --> 10:43.551
AND SHE JUDGES ME
  FOR WORKING.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.101
YEAH, NO, UH, IT'S A COMBO--
  TUMMY TUCK, BOOB JOB.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.140
  OH.

10:48.900 --> 10:52.271
  THEN AGAIN, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
A LIFT, THAT'D BE NICE.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.133
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.
YOU ARE STILL HOTTER

10:54.140 --> 10:55.780
THAN ALL THOSE MOMS
  PUT TOGETHER.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.636
  OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.000
MNH-MNH. THINK I COULD PUT UP
  WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY

11:00.001 --> 11:01.834
  FOR TEN YEARS
IF I DIDN'T THINK THAT...

11:04.835 --> 11:05.718
 YOU'RE HOT.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.162
 WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE A POINT.

11:13.168 --> 11:13.698
  MM.

11:16.268 --> 11:17.300
  YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T.

11:20.001 --> 11:21.109
  YEAH, I KNOW.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.034
OH, GOD.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.214
 YEAH?

11:32.600 --> 11:33.899
MILO.
 IS THIS A BAD TIME?

11:33.900 --> 11:36.700
NOT AT ALL. COME ON IN.

11:39.000 --> 11:39.699
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.400
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.200
 YEAH, I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

11:43.200 --> 11:44.700
  AND INSTEAD OF LEAVING
ANOTHER VOICE MAIL,

11:44.700 --> 11:46.399
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY...
  OKAY.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.500
  WITH THIS.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.099
WHAT'S THAT? OH, MY GOD.
  MM.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.100
IT'S OUR TRIP TO KEY WEST.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.400
YEAH.
CHECK OUT YOUR HAIR.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.599
MY HAIR?
TAKE A LOOK AT <i>YOUR</i> HAIR.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.900
WHAT IS THAT, A PERM?

11:58.900 --> 11:59.500
  (laughs)

12:01.400 --> 12:03.000
 I THOUGHT YOU'D GET
 A KICK OUT OF THAT.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.700
LISTEN, MILO, I HAVE...

12:09.600 --> 12:11.299
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK
ON MY DESK.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.700
SO... THANKS.

12:12.700 --> 12:16.000
 NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S FOR YOU.
 TAKE CARE, SAUL.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.600
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.599
  LIZZIE WAS IMPOSSIBLE TODAY.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.699
  I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THE DIAPER RASH

12:27.700 --> 12:28.800
 OR THE FORMULA OR--

12:28.800 --> 12:33.299
  SHE, UH, SHE SLEEPING?
YEAH, SHE'S EXHAUSTED FROM
CRYING FIVE HOURS STRAIGHT.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.800
 WELL, I'LL GET
  THE NEXT FEEDING.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.100
HEY, WE GOT THE ACCOUNT.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.500
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.900
 DO YOU MIND
IF I CALL MY PARENTS?

12:43.300 --> 12:47.000
  NO. UH, FINE. HEY, UH,
  LISTEN, BEFORE YOU GO,

12:47.300 --> 12:49.799
  KITTY'S IN TOWN, AND WE WANT
TO DO A FAMILY BIRTHDAY FOR HER.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.999
  I'M NOT REALLY UP
FOR A BIG WALKER THING.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.599
JUST MAKE UP AN EXCUSE.
 I'VE BEEN MAKING UP EXCUSES
 ALL SUMMER.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.399
  I MEAN, MOM'S OFFERED
TO COME BY AND COOK.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.499
SARAH NTS TO BRING BY THE KIDS
 SO THEY CAN MEET THEIR COUSIN.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN
I SEE PAIGE AND COOPER TOGETHER?

13:02.900 --> 13:06.300
  I THINK ABOUT WILLIAM,
OUR SON, WHO SHOULD BE HERE

13:06.300 --> 13:08.499
  WITH HIS SISTER,
WITH US, AND HE'S NOT.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.900
 LOOK, I KNOW HE'S GONE,

13:11.400 --> 13:12.900
AND I KNOW IT HURTS.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.300
  AND I'M SORRY.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.999
  ALL RIGHT, BUT LOOK--
  LOOK AT MY MOM.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.899
  EVERY TIME SHE TURNS ON THE TV
OR OPENS THE PAPER,

13:19.900 --> 13:23.800
  SHE'S REMINDED OF STIN,
  AND SHE'S TERRIFIED.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.100
WE'RE ALL TERRIFIED,

13:25.100 --> 13:28.000
 BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
OUR LIVES JUST STOP.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.200
 LOOK, LET HER HELP YOU OUT.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.899
 YOU GUYS CAN TALK, AND MAYBE--
TELL HER TO CALL ME
 WHEN JUSTIN DIES.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.900
THEN WE'LL HAVE
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.300
 WOW.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.300
  GOD...

13:40.300 --> 13:42.000
 OH, TOMMY.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.300
(whispers) OH, I'M SORRY.

13:45.100 --> 13:45.200
  (Elizabeth crying)

13:46.300 --> 13:49.799
  UM, I'LL GO GET HER.
 GO, UH, MAKE YOUR CALL.

13:49.800 --> 13:49.900
  (crying continues)

13:51.600 --> 13:55.600
  MY GOD, IT'S A VISION
  OF LOVELINESS.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.800
  MOTHER, YOU HAVEN'T
WEIGHED IN YET.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.100
IT'S LOVELY.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.299
  YOU DON'T THINK
I LOOK LIKE A FISH?

14:01.300 --> 14:05.399
NO. YOU LOOK LIKE ARIEL.
  "THE LITTLE MERMAID"?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.999
HONEY, IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
  JUST TRY ON ANOTHER ONE.
  AND WHILE YOU DO THAT,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.900
??  FOR SOMETHING
 A LITTLE MORE--
NOT UGLY?

14:13.500 --> 14:15.999
 SO, MOM, CAN YOU
  BELIEVE THESE DRESSES?

14:16.000 --> 14:16.800
HUH.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.900
 HELLO. THAT WAS A QUESTION.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.299
  WHAT ARE--
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ANYWAY?

14:22.300 --> 14:24.299
I'M TEXTING
ANOTHER WAR MOTHER.

14:24.300 --> 14:27.099
 SINCE WHEN DO YOU TEXT?
AAH. OUCH.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.399
REBECCA TAUGHT ME.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.199
 OH, REBECCA. GREAT

14:31.200 --> 14:32.999
  YES, I DIDN'T THINK
I'D GET THE HANG OF IT,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.300
BUT SHE WAS VERY PATIENT.
  OH, I BET SHE WAS.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.800
OKAY.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.900
  WHAT DO YOU THINK
  OF TS ONE?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.000
IT'S LOVELY.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.799
MOTHER, WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU?

14:46.800 --> 14:50.200
 THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST
HIDEOUS DRESS THAT EVER EXISTED.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.899
I--I'M JUST TRYING
  TO BE NICE.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.900
  I DON'T WANT NICE.
  I WANT MY MOTHER.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.600
 SO, COME ON. COME ON. JUST TELL
 ME WHY YOU'RE SO ANGRY WITH ME.
I'M NOT.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.299
ALL RIGHT, I AM.
  I AM ANGRY.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.200
WHY IS IT THAT YOU
 AND YOUR FIANC?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.299
FEEL YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER ALL THE TIME?

15:06.300 --> 15:08.700
WHAT, ARE YOU LOOKING
 FOR VOTES?
  THAT IS NOT FAIR.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.399
  WE DON'T BRING UP JUSTIN,
  THE REPORTERS DO.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.799
AND WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO, NOT SPEAK?
OH, SO I SEE.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.899
WHEN I ASK YOU TO <i>SPEAK</i>
  TO ROBERT,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.399
TO ASK HIM TO FIND OUT
ABOUT JUSTIN, YOU CAN'T DO IT.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.400
BUT THE MINUTE A REPORTER
  ASKS YOU A QUESTION,

15:20.400 --> 15:23.999
SUDDENLY YOU'RE CHATTY CATHY.
 HOW AM I EVER GONNA
 MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND

15:24.000 --> 15:27.199
  THAT I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
  ASKING ROBERT TO PULL STRINGS?
DO YOU THINK I'M COMFORTABLE

15:27.200 --> 15:30.499
NOT KNOWING WHETHER MY SON
IS DEAD OR ALIVE? DO YOU?
IT IS UNETHICAL, MOTHER,

15:30.500 --> 15:32.799
SINCE WHEN DO YOU PEOPLE
  CARE ABOUT ETHICS?
YOU PEOPLE?

15:32.800 --> 15:35.599
I HATE TO INTERRUPT BUT--
  YOU WANT ME TO ASK
  A U.S. SENATOR TO GIVE ME

15:35.600 --> 15:37.100
  CLASSIFIED
  MILITARY INFORMATION

15:37.100 --> 15:39.699
JUST SO MY LITTLE MOTHER
  WON'T WORRY?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

15:39.700 --> 15:40.900
  EVERYTHING IS WRONG WITH THAT!
WHAT?

15:40.900 --> 15:42.899
  IT'S RIDICULOUS,
 AND I WON'T DO IT. I CAN'T.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.700
  IT'S OVERSTEPPING.
OVERSTEPPING?

15:44.700 --> 15:46.000
  YES, OVERSTEPPING.
 OVERSTEPPING.
  YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT

15:46.000 --> 15:49.999
THE DAMN DEFINITION
 OF FAMILIES IS--
  YOU MIGHT WANT

15:50.000 --> 15:52.599
  DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WOULD DO
  TO THE CAMPAIGN--
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS

15:52.600 --> 15:54.900
 WELL, THAT'S TRUE--
 LADIES!
  <i>WHAT?</i>

15:55.600 --> 15:58.700
THAT MAN IS TAPING Y.
  WHAT?

16:03.700 --> 16:06.900
 MOM? QUICK.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.099
(water running)
YOU WANT SOME COMPANY IN THERE?
I CAN BE LATE FOR WORK.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.299
  (Jason) YEAH?
  WELL, I CAN'T.
YOU KNOW, I NEVER COMPLAIN

16:18.300 --> 16:20.400
WE DON'T GET TO SLEEP IN
  ON SUNDAYS.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.100
  EXCUSE ME?
  MM.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.499
  YOU COMPLAIN
  EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND.
UNH-UNH, THAT'S NOT ME

16:24.500 --> 16:26.299
  THAT'S ME WANTING
TO STAY IN BED WITH YOU.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.600
 RIGHT.
  YEAH.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.500
  SORRY, THE BISHOP
WANTS TO SEE ME.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
  ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.199
  NOW WHY WOULD I BE
  IN TROUBLE, HUH?

16:35.200 --> 16:38.499
UH, ME AND YOU. YOU AND ME.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.399
  OH, LOOK, MY SEXUALITY
  ISN'T AN ISSUE.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.700
  I'VE BEEN COMPLETELY OPEN.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.999
I HAVE NO IDEA
  WHAT THIS MEETING'S ABOUT.
SO MAYBE YOU'RE GETTING

16:45.000 --> 16:47.500
LIKE VICE... BISHOP.
  OR POPE?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.700
POPE, YEAH.
  WE DON'T HAVE A POPE.
SO NO RING?

16:49.700 --> 16:51.799
  NO RING.
WHAT ABOUT A NEW ROBE,
 THOUGH, HMM?

16:51.800 --> 16:54.199
OR AT LEAST
A SNAZZY NEW COLLAR.
  YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.000
I KNOW, BUT I'M YOUR IDIOT.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.899
  (Robert) HOW'S MY FAVORITE
 BIRTHDAY GIRL?

16:58.900 --> 17:01.499
  LOUSY. MY MOTHER AND I HAD
  A REALLY BIG FIGHT.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.400
  YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M WATCHING IT ON YouTube.
 (groans)

17:03.400 --> 17:05.800
 AnnieLoo47
GIVES IT FIVE STARS.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.099
  SHE SAYS IT'S FUNNIER
THAN THE PIANO-PLAYING CAT.
  PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.

17:09.099 --> 17:10.898
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IS A JOKE--
 THAT WEDDING DRESS.

17:10.900 --> 17:14.700
 OH, GREAT. SO NOW  WITH BRIDEZILLA JOKES
FOR THE NEXT NEWS CYCLE.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.499
KITTY, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL
  YOUR MOM THAT YOU ALREADY

17:16.500 --> 17:17.999
ASKED ME ABOUT JUSTIN,
AND I SAID N

17:18.000 --> 17:21.098
 WELL, BECAUSE, ROBERT,
  MY MOTHER HAS TOOVE ME.

17:21.099 --> 17:23.599
 I'M HER DAUGHTER.
  BUT YOU, NOT SO MUCH.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.800
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.400
  FIND OUT WHERE HE IS.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.299
KITTY, YOU KNOW
 I CAN'T DO IT.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.400
 NOT EVEN
  AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

17:34.400 --> 17:39.400
  I MEAN, YOU DO REALIZE THAT
MY FATHER DIED A YEAR AGO TODAY.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.000
  YOU DID NOT JUST TRY
TO GUILT-TRIP ME

17:42.000 --> 17:44.999
  WITH YOUR FATHER'S DEATH.
  It would only take you
 one phone call.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.500
  WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
  IN OVER THREE WEEKS.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.899
Every day,
  there's another I.E.D.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.400
  EVERY DAY,
  THERE'S ANOTHER CAR BOMB.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.300
KITTY, I HATE THAT YOU'RE GOING
  THROUGH THIS, I REALLY DO,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.399
but there are 150,000

17:55.400 --> 17:57.699
OTHER FAMILIES GOING THROUGH
  THE EXACT SAME THING.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.900
I CAN'T MAKE
AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.800
 CAN'T OR WON'T?

18:04.200 --> 18:06.100
BEN FROM THE R.N.C.'s
ON THE LINE.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.600
  OKAY. I HAVE TO GO.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.500
THEN GO.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.600
(sighs) HAPPY BIRTHDAY?

18:12.000 --> 18:12.800
  YEP.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.400
 (beep)

18:17.400 --> 18:19.300
  HAVE YOU TRIED PUTTING HER

18:19.300 --> 18:21.800
  IN THE PAPASAN
 OR THE MIRACLE BLANKET?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.799
HEY. HONEY, I GOTTA CALL YOU
BACK. SARAH'S HERE.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.900
I-I WILL. I WILL.
  I PROMISE.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.700
 IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
 AT HOME?

18:29.700 --> 18:33.200
  YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S FINE. WHAT'S UP?

18:34.900 --> 18:36.600
  JOE AND I HAD SEX.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.300
  DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

18:41.000 --> 18:44.299
  ME... JOE... SEX.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.300
YEAH. AND?

18:45.300 --> 18:48.699
  AND AS A MALE, WHAT DO YOU
THINK HE WAS THINKING?

18:48.700 --> 18:50.799
  I MEAN, DO YOU THINK HE WANTS
  TO GET BACK TOGETHER?

18:50.800 --> 18:53.299
BECAUSE WE'VE ALMOST
  STOPPED FIGHTING,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.300
AND THE SEX WAS AMAZING.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.699
 WE WERE ON
THE WASHING MACHINE.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.700
EW! BLOCKING OUT THAT VISUAL.

18:58.700 --> 19:03.599
  SORRY. BUT SERIOUSLY, I MEAN,
MAYBE THIS SEPARATION WAS--

19:03.600 --> 19:05.999
  WAS WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP
  NEEDED, YOU KNOW?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.400
  WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:08.100 --> 19:09.800
I THINK YOU SHOULD
  TALK TO JOE.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.300
  THAT'S IT? "TALK TO JOE"?

19:14.400 --> 19:15.700
WHAT? WHAT?

19:15.700 --> 19:17.999
LOOK, I'M COMPLETELY SWAMPED
  WITH THIS NEW ACCOUNT.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.699
  I HAVEN'T FINISHED
PACKING UP THE OFFICE.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.900
  I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY DR. RUTH, OKAY?

19:23.400 --> 19:24.700
I'M SORRY.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.500
  OH. SORRY TO INTRUDE.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.100
  SARAH...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.100
  WOW.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.500
  I SEE MY MOM
 DOESN'T BUG YOU ABOUT KEEPING YOUR ROOM CLEAN.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.599
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO WEAR.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.100
WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.
I HAD SHOES.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.399
 I-I HAD A LOT OF SHOES.
I HAD REALLY, REALLY NICE SHOES.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.900
YEAH, I PUT THEM IN BOXES
 IN THE CORNER.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.300
YOU WANT ME
TO GRAB 'EM FOR YOU?
NO. NO, THANKS,

19:59.700 --> 20:00.800
??

20:04.600 --> 20:06.099
  OH, I FOUND
A PRESENT FOR YOU.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.999
  OH, REBECCA,
THAT'S--THAT'S SO SWEET,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.400
  BUT REALLY,
YOU--YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.600
I DIDN'T, ACTUALLY. I JUST
 FOUND IT IN THE DRESSER.
YOU FOUND...

20:19.800 --> 20:19.100
 (sighs)

20:19.100 --> 20:21.500
 THAT'S THE GIFT THAT MY DAD
  GAVE ME LAST YEAR.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.300
 OH.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.100
  I'M SORRY.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.499
  NO, NO. NO, NO.
  'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.000
IT'S JUST... THANKS.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.399
  BUT I WOULD REALLY
 APPRECIATE IT

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
  IF YOU WOULD STAY OUT
OF MY STUFF.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.600
  HEY.

20:43.100 --> 20:43.800
  HEY.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.299
  WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH THE BISHOP SO LONG?

20:45.300 --> 20:46.400
SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

20:47.100 --> 20:49.399
  NO. NO, THE MEETING
  ENDED A WHILE AGO.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.400
  I JUST, UH, NEEDED SOME TIME
 TO THINK, THAT'S ALL.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.400
 HE TOLD YOU TO BREAK UP
  WITH ME, DIDN'T HE?

20:55.900 --> 20:58.400
NO. NO, HE'S UH,

20:58.700 --> 21:01.500
  HE'S SENDING ME
ON A MISSION... TO MALAYSIA.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.199
  MALAYSIA?

21:05.200 --> 21:05.900
YEAH.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.700
I KNOW. IT'S FAR.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.099
  NO. UH, NO, ACTUALLY,
 THAT'S--THAT'S NOT FAR.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.300
  I MEAN, UM...

21:15.800 --> 21:17.600
NEW YORK IS FAR.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.100
  MALAYSIA'S HALFWAY
  AROUND THE WORLD.

21:21.100 --> 21:24.099
  SO DID YOU TELL HIM YOU CAN'T

21:24.100 --> 21:27.200
BECAUSE YOU'RE
  IN A RELATIONSHIP?

21:27.600 --> 21:29.000
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.200
  OKAY? IT'S JUST
FOR A FEW MONTHS...

21:32.600 --> 21:33.799
OR A YEAR.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.699
 A YEAR? UM, OH, WOW. I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

21:36.700 --> 21:38.800
YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND.
  FOR GOD SAKE, JASON--

21:38.800 --> 21:41.299
OH, NO, OF COURSE, GOD'S THE ONE
  WHO WANTS YOU TO FORSAKE ME.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.300
OKAY, KEVIN, KEVIN, I MADE
A COMMITMENT TO THE CHURCH.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.999
THIS IS MY FAITH.
  OH, WHAT, SO NOW I'M SUPPOSED
 TO BE HAPPY THAT YOU'RE LEAVING

21:47.000 --> 21:49.999
 TO CONVERT THE UNWASHED MASSES?
WHICH, I'M SORRY,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.599
I FIND DISTASTEFULLY
COLONIALIST OF YOU.
I'M HELPING BUILD A SCHOOL.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.500
  OH, WELL, GREAT.
FORGET IT, YOU KNOW?

21:55.500 --> 21:58.299
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T COMPETE
  WITH POOR, NEEDY CHILDREN.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO, YOU CAN'T COMPETE,

22:00.400 --> 22:02.900
 BECAUSE THIS IS BIGGER
THAN ME AND WHAT I WANT.
OH, W-WHAT,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.799
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD
WHO NEED HELP.
 YES, JASON, PEOPLE LIKE ME.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.100
WHO <i>REALLY</i> NEED HELP.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
  WE'RE... (groans)

22:09.500 --> 22:11.200
  GO AHEAD.
WE'RE--WE'RE WHAT? HUH?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.800
   'CAUSE EVERY TIME I EVEN
SUGGESTED TRYING TO DEFINE US,

22:14.800 --> 22:17.099
YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
 I'M SORRY.
  THIS IS NOW MY FAULT?

22:17.100 --> 22:19.100
NO, IS ISN'T YOUR FAULT,
  OKAY?

22:19.100 --> 22:21.899
BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT SOMEONE
 TO JUST ORGANIZE HIS LIFE

22:21.900 --> 22:25.100
AROUND YOU WHEN YOU CAN'T
 EVEN SAY, "I LOVE YOU."

22:26.400 --> 22:27.100
  WHEW.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.399
 YEAH, WELL,
GOOD THING I DIDN'T,

22:30.400 --> 22:32.100
  'CAUSE LOOK WHERE I'D BE NOW.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.300
I'M SORRY.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.399
HEY, MAYBE IF YOU HAD
  A LITTLE FAITH--

22:36.400 --> 22:37.600
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.700
 (duck quacks)

23:04.600 --> 23:05.000
(quack)

23:05.000 --> 23:09.399
FANCY MEETING YOU HERE.
 DON'T WORRY.
  I'M--I'M LEAVING.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.199
  NO, STAY.
WE SHARED HIM IN LIFE.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.800
WE MIGHT AS WELL
 SHARE HIM NOW.

23:14.700 --> 23:17.500
OH.
AREN'T YOUR FLOWERS PRETTY?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.600
  I THINK I MIGHT'VE
  OVERDONE IT A LITTLE BIT.

23:24.900 --> 23:25.000
 HMM.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.600
(clears throat)

23:27.600 --> 23:28.499
 HOW ARE THINGS?

23:28.500 --> 23:29.799
  GOOD.
GOOD.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.300
  TOMMY AND I
  ARE WORKING A LOT.

23:32.300 --> 23:37.200
  THE WINERY OFFICE
  IS JUST ABOUT OPEN, SO...
THAT EXPLAINS WHY I HAVEN'T

23:38.700 --> 23:39.999
  SO HOW'S MY DAUGHTER?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.900
REBECCA'S A GODSEND,
AN ABSOLUTE GODSEND.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.100
  I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT HER.

23:43.100 --> 23:48.700
ALL THAT YOUTHFUL ENERGY AROUND.
 THAT EXPLAINS WHY IT'S SO QUIET
 AT MY HOUSE THESE DAYS.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.700
  I'M SORRY.
I HONESTLY DIDN'T MEAN--
  NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.300
 HAVE YOU HEARD FROM JUSTIN?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.500
 NO.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.099
 NOT IN A WHILE.

24:03.100 --> 24:07.100
  OH, I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.199
SHE REMINDS ME OF WILLIAM.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.299
SHE'S SO WARM AND GENEROUS,

24:12.300 --> 24:13.900
  BUT SHE KEEPS
SO MUCH BOTTLED UP.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.000
 (chuckles) LIKE FATHER,
  LIKE DAUGHTER.

24:17.500 --> 24:18.600
  YES.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.600
  I STILL MISS HIM.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.100
  SO DO I.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.300
 BASTARD.

24:29.500 --> 24:29.600
(laughs)

24:31.900 --> 24:33.200
LISTEN, WE'RE GIVING

24:33.200 --> 24:34.499
A BIRTHDAY DINNER
TONIGHT FOR KITTY.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.299
LD YOU LIKE TO COME,
 SEE REBECCA?

24:36.300 --> 24:37.800
I'D LOVE TO.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.199
  I-I MEAN, UNLESS--I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.999
  HOLLY, YOU BEING HERE
AT MY HUSBAND'S GRAVESITE,

24:43.000 --> 24:44.100
THAT'S AN POSITION.

24:44.100 --> 24:47.600
ARING A TACO WITH
YOUR DAUGHTER, I CAN LIVE WITH.
OKAY.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.600
  (car door closes)

24:57.700 --> 25:01.600
YOU DON'T THINK
WILLIAM H-HAD--
OH, GOD, DO YOU THINK...

25:08.700 --> 25:10.900
(laughs) NAH.
OF COURSE NOT.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.600
??

25:16.600 --> 25:18.299
 GOODY. MAYBE SOMEDAY WE'LL HAVE
  A CHANCE TO EAT SOME OF THEM.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.099
  OH, COME ON, GUYS,
 STOP READING THE MENU.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.500
  I'M STARVING ALREADY
  FOR ALCOHOL.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.900
  AND WE ARE GONNA KILL YOU
 AT BOWLING ON FRIDAY!

25:30.000 --> 25:32.200
  (cheering)
YEAH! GET IT ON!

25:33.900 --> 25:34.300
 (man barking)

25:36.000 --> 25:37.300
I'M SORRY, BUT IS THERE
  ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

25:37.300 --> 25:40.299
 KATHY PROMISED ME
 WE HAVE A TABLE.
KATHY PROMISED EVERYONE THAT,

25:40.300 --> 25:41.800
WHICH IS WHY
SHE WAS FIRED TODAY.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.099
THE PARTY AT YOUR TABLE
SHOULD BE FINISHED SOON.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.200
YOU CAN HAVE A DRINK
AT THE BAR.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.800
YEAH, I KNOW. THANK YOU.

25:49.300 --> 25:50.899
  (gasps)
OH, MY GOD, SHE IS--

25:50.900 --> 25:52.900
 SHE'S JUST TOO PERFECT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING HER?

25:52.900 --> 25:54.299
OH, YEAH,
 'CAUSE A SCREAMING BABY

25:54.300 --> 25:56.099
  WOULD'VE MADE THIS EVENING
SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.899
 THAT'S WHY I LEFT HER AT HOME.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.699
 AT LEAST I KNOW
 WHAT THE TITLE OF MY...

25:59.700 --> 26:01.400
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS GONNA BE--

26:01.400 --> 26:04.099
  "KEVIN WALKER--A LIFETIME
OF ENDLESS DISAPPOINTMENTS."

26:04.100 --> 26:06.000
  OH, COME ON, THEY'VE
  GOT PHONES IN ASIA.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.599
 <i>MALAYSIA,</i>
  AND WHAT'S THE POINT?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.399
 IF IT WEREN'T GOD,
  HE'D DUMP ME FOR SOMEONE ELSE

26:09.400 --> 26:13.199
  LIKE... SHIVA
 OR A LIFUARD.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.900
OR MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO USES
  A LITTLE LESS PRODUCT.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.800
DON'T WORRY, IT'S--
  I DON'T--OHH!

26:23.000 --> 26:24.500
DO WE HAVE AN E.T.A.?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.100
  HI.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.699
WHAT?
  I THOUGHT I WAS LATE.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.400
 MOM?
 HOLLY?

26:30.100 --> 26:32.300
  YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM,
  DID YOU?

26:32.400 --> 26:35.799
IT'S A BIRTHDAY. EVERYONE LOVES
  SURPRISES ON A BIRTHDAY.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.999
  EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
  I NEED, I THINK, A DRINK.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.900
I SECOND THAT.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.699
  MOM, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.899
IF YOU WOULD ANSWER
  MY CALLS, YOU'D KNOW.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.299
 REBECCA, YOUR MOTHER
JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.800
OH, WELL, NOW YOU HAVE.
  EXCUSE ME.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.899
WANT TO LOOK AT THE MENU?

26:53.900 --> 26:56.600
HOW COULD MOM DO THIS TO ME
 ON MY BIRTHDAY, NO LESS?

26:56.600 --> 26:59.799
ARE WE OVER HATING HOLLY YET?
  WE DON'T HATE HOLLY.
  IT'S JUST AWKWARD, THAT'S ALL.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.899
 I HATE HER.
  YEAH, YOU HATE EVERYONE.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.999
 OH, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T GET
 A QUICKIE ON THE SPIN CYCLE

27:04.000 --> 27:05.600
  TO PUT ME IN A GOOD MOOD.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.400
TOMMY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
 YOU WOULD--

27:09.400 --> 27:12.399
  YOU ARE SUCH AN ASS!
  SINCE WHEN ARE WE
  NOT ALLOWED TO BLAB?

27:12.400 --> 27:14.300
 RELAX, I WILL GO TALK TO HER.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.699
 HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ME.
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OJAI.

27:16.700 --> 27:20.199
IT'S LIKE HE'S COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED FROM MY LIFE.
  OH, HE'S A NEW PARENT, SARAH.

27:20.200 --> 27:24.299
OH, GOD, I LOOK OLD.
NO, YOU DON'T.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.899
  NO, I DO. I FEEL OLD.
  YEAH--

27:25.900 --> 27:27.599
 AND LET'S--LET'S TALK ABOUT
REBECCA FOR A MINUTE.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.299
 I MEAN, WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?
I MEAN, SHE BARELY KNOWS ME,

27:30.300 --> 27:33.299
YET SOMEHOW SHE MANAGES
  TO PLAN MY BIRTHDAY PARTY?

27:33.300 --> 27:36.800
I MEAN, I DON'T--I DON'T
 EVEN LIKE MEXICAN FOOD.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.000
(toilet flushes)

27:41.000 --> 27:43.299
REBECCA, UH, HI.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.999
WE--WE WERE JUST, UH--
TALKING ABOUT ME. I HEARD.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.999
YOU KNOW, FOR ONCE WHY DON'T
YOU JUST TELL ME TO MY FACE

27:48.000 --> 27:49.900
THAT YOU HATE THAT
I'M A PART OF THIS FAMILY?

27:52.400 --> 27:54.000
  I SHOULD GO.
 (clears throat)

27:56.300 --> 27:57.799
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, REBECCA,

27:57.800 --> 28:01.499
  I AM... I'M SORRY
IF I HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.799
IT'S JUST THAT--
 WHY DON'T YOU STOP
TRYING TO BE POLITE,

28:03.800 --> 28:09.099
  OR WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
AND JUST--JUST TELL ME,

28:09.100 --> 28:10.500
  YOU HAVE A MILLION SHOES.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.799
WELL, REBECCA,
THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.699
AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW, I MEAN,
I'VE BEEN GONE FOR WHAT,

28:14.700 --> 28:16.899
TWO MONTHS, AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE MY MOM'S FAVORITE.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.200
I MEAN, HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

28:18.200 --> 28:22.300
HOW DID YOU GO FROM HOME WRECKER
 TO SURROGATE DAUGHTER?
BECAUSE I WAS THERE.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.799
 BECAUSE I'M NOT BUSY LIKE
  EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS FAMILY.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.000
AND YEAH, WE GO
  TO YOGA SOMETIMES,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
  AND SOMETIMES
WE COOK DINNER TOGETHER,

28:28.000 --> 28:29.999
 BUT AT LEAST SHE'S NOT SPENDING
  EVERY WAKING MINUTE

28:30.000 --> 28:31.099
THINKING ABOUT IRAQ.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.500
I MEAN, OH, GOD,
AND I'M SO SORRY

28:32.500 --> 28:34.200
THAT I TRIED TO PLAN
  YOU A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.500
 I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.
  I'M DONE TRYING. I'M...

28:41.300 --> 28:43.000
  (door opens)

28:43.000 --> 28:44.200
 **

28:44.200 --> 28:45.400
  OHH.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.699
IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY.
TEQUILA MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER.
NOBODY SAYS THAT.

28:48.700 --> 28:52.099
  WELL, WHEN I'M FIRST LADY,
I'LL SAY IT, AND IT'LL CATCH ON.

28:52.100 --> 28:53.999
HEY, YOU'RE NOT REALLY
ANGRY WITH ME, ARE YOU?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.899
  OH, I'M SORRY. I'M--
  I'M TOO BUSY TO TALK.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.899
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
 OH, DING, DING.
  GIVE THAT MAN A PRIZE.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.799
 YOU KNOW
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
  WHAT'S MY FAULT THIS TIME?

29:01.800 --> 29:04.199
  "THE THORN BIRDS."
YOU MADE ME WATCH IT WITH YOU.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.200
RICHARCHAMBERLAIN AND HIS
 CUTE LITTLE WHITE COLLAR,

29:06.200 --> 29:10.200
  "A LOVE THAT'S TABOO
AND IRRESISTIBLE," OOH.
MOM, MOM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:10.300 --> 29:13.299
WE CAN'T EVEN GET A TABLE. CAN
WE PLEASE JUST CALL IT A NIGHT?

29:13.300 --> 29:15.299
NOW THAT'S A BIT SELFISH
  OF YOU, ISN'T IT?
  SELFISH?

29:15.300 --> 29:17.699
I MEAN, WE ARE ALL HERE
  FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

29:17.700 --> 29:20.700
 AND WE <i>WILL</i> BE SEATED.
  <i>NOW.</i>

29:24.000 --> 29:25.300
  DON'T ASK.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.900
 UNCLE SAUL, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT IDEA, YOU KNOW THAT?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.899
NO TIES, NO COMMITMENTS,
AND IF YOU WANT TO SPEND

29:30.900 --> 29:33.299
THE WHOLE WEEKEND IN BED DOING
  NOTHING BUT WATCHING PORN

29:33.300 --> 29:34.999
AND DOING "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
  CRSWORD,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.200
WOULD ANYONE STOP YOU? NO.
 SHUT UP, KEVIN.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.100
  JUST PLEASE DO ME A VOR.
 SHUT UP NOW.
I'M TRYING TO PAY YOU

29:41.200 --> 29:43.099
  YOU ARE SO OBLIVIOUS.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.900
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW BLESSED YOU ARE?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.899
 ANGRY?
  NO, I'M NOT ANGRY, TOMMY.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.200
  I WOULD SAY I'M DISAPPOINTED.
 I MEAN, HERE I AM

29:49.200 --> 29:51.300
  TRYING TO MAYBE GET
  MY MARRIAGE BACK TOGETHER,

29:51.300 --> 29:56.299
  LOOKING FOR A SYMPATHETIC EAR,
 AND YOU DON'T HAVE TIME.
OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY

29:56.300 --> 29:58.499
  I MEAN, JULIA HASN'T LEFT
THE HOUSE SINCE WILLIAM DIED.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.000
I KNOW--
  ALL RIGHT?
SHE WON'T STOP CRYING.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.299
THE ONLY PEOPLE SHE'LL TALK TO
ARE HER PARENTS, OKAY?
JULIA WON'T STOP CRYING?

30:03.300 --> 30:04.799
YES. I MEAN, IT'S NON--
JULIA WON'T STOP CRYING.

30:04.800 --> 30:08.199
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
  WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? YOU SHOULD
 TALK. THIS IS SERIOUS.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.999
 WAIT A MINUTE. DID YOU JUST SAY
  THAT SHE SHOULDN'T TELL ME,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.900
BECAUSE WHAT, WHAT,
I'M NOT YOUR SISTER?
SHE JUST DIDN'T HAVE TO

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
 (all talking at once)

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
HEY, GUYS.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.300
 (all talking at once)
 HEY, WALKERS!

30:26.000 --> 30:27.100
ROBERT.

30:27.800 --> 30:28.799
  WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:28.800 --> 30:29.999
 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
  IN PHOENIX.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.900
I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU.
  WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

30:31.900 --> 30:33.699
  AND DO YOU KNOW WHY
  HE'S NOT HERE TO CELEBRATE?

30:33.700 --> 30:36.299
  BECAUSE HE'S OFF FIGHTING
  IN THAT STUPID WAR.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.499
AND ONE MORE THING THAT
MAKES THIS DAY SPECIAL--

30:38.500 --> 30:40.899
MY CHEATING HUSBAND DIED
  A YEAR AGO TODAY.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.300
  (woman) MA'AM,
  YOU'RE DISTURBING OUR PATRONS.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.299
SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD MOVE
YOUR DRUNKEN ASSES

30:44.300 --> 30:46.099
 OUT OF THESE CHAIRS,
THEN PERHAPS MY FAMILY

30:46.100 --> 30:47.700
COULD SIT DOWN
AND EAT A DAMN BURRITO

30:47.700 --> 30:49.499
  AND END THIS MISERABLE DAY!
  MOM?

30:49.500 --> 30:52.900
WHAT?
 JUSTIN'S OKAY.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.200
WHAT?
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
 ANY SPECIFICS,

30:56.200 --> 30:58.299
BUT HE'S BEEN OUT ON A MISSION
  FOR A FEW WEEKS.

30:58.300 --> 31:01.400
  IT'S OVER.
HE'S HEADED BACK TO BASE.
  OH, GOD!

31:01.700 --> 31:04.399
JUSTIN'S ALL RIGHT! OH, ROBERT,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

31:04.400 --> 31:05.600
  I KNEW YOU'D COME THROUGH.

31:05.600 --> 31:08.999
 HEY, McCALLISTER.
  YOU'RE WAITIN' ON US?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.999
UH, YES, BUT I HOPE I CAN
STILL COUNT ON YOUR VOTE.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.500

31:14.700 --> 31:17.500
 (sniffs) SO WHO'S UP
  FOR SOME MORE NACHOS, HUH?

31:17.700 --> 31:21.200
WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT TABLE.
  OH, I COULD CARE LESS.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.299

  YEAH, ME, TOO.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.100
  I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T NEED TO COME OUT.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.900
OH, I WANTED TO BE HERE.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.100
SO WHERE'S THE PARTY?
IT'S IN THE LIVING ROOM.

32:06.708 --> 32:07.533

32:08.108 --> 32:10.107

32:10.108 --> 32:10.708
I NEED TO TALK
 TO REBECCA.

32:14.014 --> 32:14.565
  HI.

32:15.277 --> 32:15.799

32:16.718 --> 32:17.760
IT'S A GREAT PARTY.

32:18.362 --> 32:20.292

 HAVE JUST ORDERED

32:20.292 --> 32:23.164
 BEER AND PIZZA

  MM, YEAH.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.478
WELL, WE'RE NOT REALLY FIT
  TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC.

32:26.277 --> 32:26.377
 **

32:29.704 --> 32:31.780
 SO I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

32:31.780 --> 32:32.766
 I SHOULDN'T
 HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

32:32.766 --> 32:34.874
NO, NO, YOU SHOULD'VE,
 AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:37.476 --> 32:39.223
  YOU SHOULDN'T BE
THE ONLY ONE TRYING.

32:41.017 --> 32:43.245
I'M REALLY SORRY
  ABOUT YOUR DAD'S PRESENT.

32:43.581 --> 32:45.285
MM. THAT'S OKAY.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.588
I GUESS I WAS JUST,
  I DON'T KNOW,

33:12.185 --> 33:13.389
 I KNOW IT CAN'T
 HAVE BEEN EASY.

33:14.322 --> 33:16.427
  IT'S ACTUALLY MORE OKAY
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,

33:16.456 --> 33:17.537
BUT THANKS.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.034

33:36.429 --> 33:38.822
SO, UH,

33:40.966 --> 33:42.595
YOU KNOW WHAT?
 JUSTIN'S ALL RIGHT.

33:43.704 --> 33:45.109
  I CAN'T BE MAD
AT ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

33:50.344 --> 33:52.839
  WOW. THAT LOOKS GREAT.

33:53.589 --> 33:54.524
 CAN I HELP?

33:54.841 --> 33:55.954
NO, I THINK I GOT IT.

33:57.589 --> 33:58.568
 OKAY.

34:00.458 --> 34:01.427
ACTUALLY, UM...

34:02.993 --> 34:04.917

IN THAT DRAWER OVER THERE.

34:05.889 --> 34:06.837
  I'M ON IT.

34:10.201 --> 34:12.973
  LOOK, THIS SUMMER HAS BEEN
  ONE OF THE BEST I'VE HAD

34:12.973 --> 34:13.772
 IN A LONG TIME.

34:13.774 --> 34:16.344
  OH, I KNOW. IT'S LIKE
DANNY AND SANDY IN "GREASE."

34:16.779 --> 34:17.574
  YEAH?

34:17.837 --> 34:20.757
  WHICH ONE OF US IS SANDY?
 WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT

SO I THINK THAT MAKES YOU

34:22.458 --> 34:24.875
 THE GOODY TWO-SHOES
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.
(laughs)

34:27.606 --> 34:31.690

38:17.195 --> 38:19.074
ROBERT IS STILL MAKING CALLS.

38:19.074 --> 38:21.220
 MOM, I REALLY THINK THAT YOU
NEED TO LIE DOWN OR SOMETHING.

38:22.814 --> 38:25.706
  NO, I NEED TO FIX
 JUSTIN'S ROOM.

38:26.883 --> 38:27.779
MOM.

38:35.125 --> 38:37.504
 I PROMISED HIM
  I WOULD BE BRAVE.

38:38.195 --> 38:40.352

  I'M HERE.

39:16.390 --> 39:18.328
  JOE,
I WANT YOU TO COME HOME.

39:22.552 --> 39:23.714
WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

39:23.716 --> 39:25.875
NO, NOW.
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT NOW.

39:26.884 --> 39:29.795
 WHEN I HEARD ABOUT JUSTIN,
  ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS YOU.

39:31.394 --> 39:32.726
  I WANTED TO BE WITH MY FAMILY.

39:32.726 --> 39:35.204
  THAT'S YOU, JOE.
 THAT'S--THAT'S YOU.

39:35.204 --> 39:36.962
 I KNOW, I KNOW,
AND, UM, YOU KNOW,

39:36.962 --> 39:40.131
WHEN EVERYTHING SETTLES DOWN,
 WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

39:42.662 --> 39:45.024
  I THOUGHT, THE OTHER DAY,
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED, TOO.

39:45.024 --> 39:47.802
  PLEASE, DON'T.
I WAS CONFUSED, SO...

39:49.316 --> 39:51.875
  SO YOU DON'T WANT
 TO MOVE BACK?

39:52.628 --> 39:53.236
SARAH, I--

39:53.236 --> 39:54.327
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

39:55.614 --> 39:56.834
 YOU WANT A DIVORCE?

40:00.114 --> 40:02.314
("Who'll Stop the Rain" playing)

40:02.914 --> 40:04.232
  JUSTIN, HEY.

40:06.031 --> 40:07.940
  I DON'T KNOW
 HOW YOU ARE RIGHT NOW

40:08.668 --> 40:09.775
  OR WHERE YOU ARE,

40:10.150 --> 40:12.317
 BUT, UM, I'M JUST GONNA ASSUME
 THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT

40:12.341 --> 40:14.911
  AND THAT YOU'LL BE
  WATCHING THIS SOON.

40:17.661 --> 40:19.397
  I'VE BEEN GETTING
 TO KNOW YOUR FAMILY...

40:20.208 --> 40:21.644
NOT THAT THAT'S
  AN EASY THING TO DO,

40:21.644 --> 40:24.075
 BECAUSE, WELL,
 THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE UNHINGED,

40:24.244 --> 40:28.768
 BUT I THINK TONIGHT I FINALLY
  STARTED TO FIGURE THEM OUT.

40:29.944 --> 40:33.143
  LIKE TOMMY--
HE'S ALWAYS SO STOIC...

40:34.040 --> 40:36.008
   <i>TAKING CARE</i>
 <i>OF EVERYONE AROUND HIM.</i>

40:37.044 --> 40:39.670
   <i>I'M JUST NOT SURE</i>
   <i>WHO'S TAKING CARE OF HIM.</i>

40:41.344 --> 40:43.344
  <i>(Rebecca) AND KEVIN--</i>
 <i>WHEN HE'S REALLY HURT,</i>

40:43.344 --> 40:45.141
  <i>MAN, IS HE SARCASTIC</i>
   <i>AND FUNNY.</i>

40:45.344 --> 40:46.923
   <i>GOD, HE'S BRUTALLY FUNNY,</i>
 <i>BUT...</i>

40:48.444 --> 40:51.271
  <i>I THINK EVEN HE KNOWS</i>
   <i>THAT'S NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH.</i>

40:52.044 --> 40:53.099
   <i>NOT NOW.</i>

40:53.944 --> 40:55.248
  <i>NOt FOR THIS.</i>

40:58.444 --> 40:59.843
  <i>AND SARAH'S JUST THIS FORCE,</i>

40:59.844 --> 41:02.246
   <i>KIND OF LIKE SUPERWOMAN,</i>
   <i>YOU KNOW,</i>

41:02.544 --> 41:04.552
   <i>WITH THE KIDS AND THE JOB.</i>

41:04.552 --> 41:07.232
  <i>SHE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING SO HARD</i>
  <i>FOR HER FAMILY ALL THE TIME,</i>

41:07.234 --> 41:09.795
   <i>BUT I'M SURE SHE SOMETIMES</i>
  <i>WISHES IT WAS EASIER,</i>

41:11.503 --> 41:13.035
   <i>NOT SO COMPLICATED.</i>

41:14.696 --> 41:16.883
 <i>KITTY'S THE ONE</i>
   <i>I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET,</i>

41:17.065 --> 41:18.333
   <i>BUT I'M GLAD SHE CAME HOME.</i>

41:18.333 --> 41:21.587
 <i>I-I THINK SHE NEEDED TO</i>
   <i>BE HERE, ESPECIALLY NOW.</i>

41:22.138 --> 41:24.820
 <i>I THINK BEING AROUND HER FAMILY</i>
  <i>IS WHAT GROUNDS HER,</i>

41:25.402 --> 41:27.632
  <i>GIVES HER DIRECTION,</i>
 <i>KEEPS HER SANE.</i>

41:34.922 --> 41:37.761
  <i>AND YOUR MOM--OH, SHE'S LIKE</i>
 <i>THE MOST AMAZING WOMAN</i>

41:37.761 --> 41:38.575
 <i>I'VE EVER MET--</i>

41:38.576 --> 41:40.561
 <i>THE WAY SHE HANDLES EVERYTHING</i>
  <i>AND EVERYONE.</i>

41:42.148 --> 41:44.386
   <i>BUT EVERY SO OFTEN,</i>

41:44.424 --> 41:46.181
   <i>I CAN TELL</i>
   <i>SHE'S A MILLION MILES AWAY,</i>

41:46.990 --> 41:48.122
   <i>THINKING ABOUT YOU.</i>

41:49.386 --> 41:51.890
 <i>AND THEN SHE JUST LOOKS</i>
  <i>SO SCARED AND SMALL.</i>

41:54.657 --> 41:57.248
  AND YOU WERE WRONG
  ABOUT BEING THE BLACK SHEEP.

42:00.001 --> 42:02.020
YOU'RE THE HEART
OF THIS FAMILY, JUSTIN.

42:04.059 --> 42:05.464
  THEY NEED YOU AND...

42:05.573 --> 42:07.513
* AND I WONDER *

42:08.012 --> 42:09.428
 <i>I</i> NEED YOU, SO...

42:11.513 --> 42:13.135
PLEASE BE OKAY.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.662
PLEASE.
