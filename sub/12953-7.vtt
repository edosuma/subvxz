00:35.035 --> 00:36.537
I'm an officer.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.915
I swore an oath never to betray a state secret.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.458
You said it was important.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.710
Highest national security. What is it?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.714
Russia's been developing Black Thorine.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.883
Developing? Researching.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.010
Producing. We've made some.

00:52.094 --> 00:55.556
We've only been able to distill a small amount -- 10 milliliters.

00:55.630 --> 00:57.347
Enough for a single vial.

00:57.806 --> 01:01.641
This government will stop at nothing to contain this information.

01:01.726 --> 01:03.235
So why tell me?

01:03.939 --> 01:05.649
Because the vial was stolen.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.485
By whom?

01:10.028 --> 01:13.740
This is the routing number to my superior's bank account.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.160
He's recently come into a great deal of money.

02:03.707 --> 02:04.917
Let's go.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.098
Sydney.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.809
We didn't expect you back so soon.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.198
- So, Russia was a success?
- Yeah.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.621
There's a report waiting for you in the office.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.000
Sydney, he just dropped by. I didn't realize --

02:47.084 --> 02:47.835
Get out.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.297
Very well.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.426
I'll walk myself to the door.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.349
I'll see you both tomorrow.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.059
Okay.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.528
He came by. Wanted to talk.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.032
He says he wants a fresh start, to get to know me.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.742
You think that's all he wants?

03:20.826 --> 03:21.910
A little father-daughter bonding?

03:21.994 --> 03:22.911
I know how you feel about him --

03:22.953 --> 03:24.329
You can't possibly.

03:25.873 --> 03:26.874
I don't understand.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.208
You work with him at A.P.O.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.794
I accepted the job so I could watch him.

03:31.253 --> 03:35.132
Don't delude yourself, Nadia, into thinking you can trust that man.

03:35.257 --> 03:35.966
Do that,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.759
and you will end up hating yourself for it.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.178
He's my father.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.471
If you knew what he's done.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.348
Sydney, I know.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.350
I know what he did...

03:46.351 --> 03:47.311
to you.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.022
What he took from you.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.274
Your best friend.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.276
Your fiancÃ©.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.491
And knowing that, you still let him into my home?

04:04.286 --> 04:08.248
I'm not naive, Sydney. I'm not deluded.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.629
It's not easy to reconcile the past.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.548
I thought you had.

04:21.637 --> 04:25.098
The development of Black Thorine -- that violates how many treaties?

04:25.224 --> 04:26.975
Twelve, to be exact.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.060
Well, there's a reason.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.229
It's a mega-breakthrough in explosives.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.231
It's odorless, undetectable.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.399
I ran a simulation.

04:34.650 --> 04:35.776
Check it out.

04:38.987 --> 04:39.780
Huh?

04:39.905 --> 04:41.532
It leveled an entire city block.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.075
And that's just a little drop of Black Thorine.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.953
Imagine if you had the whole... vi--

04:46.245 --> 04:49.790
it's actually a real depressing take on progress.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.416
Are we sure there's only one vial?

04:51.500 --> 04:52.918
The russians are stonewalling.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.212
They refuse to acknowledge the existence of a substance,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.714
much less admit that they're developing one.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.259
But my sources confirm that they're panicking.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.593
Your sources?

05:02.427 --> 05:06.306
If that vial is their only prototype, as intel appears to corroborate,

05:06.390 --> 05:10.394
its theft has set their classified weapons program back decades.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.646
Would you mind telling us where that intel comes from,

05:12.729 --> 05:16.400
or are we all supposed to rely on your sources, no questions asked?

05:18.443 --> 05:19.695
That's a fair question,

05:20.445 --> 05:22.114
but one I'm not inclined to answer

05:22.239 --> 05:25.826
unless you need me to explain the essential nature of confidentiality.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.287
No, I'm all caught up on that, thanks.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.749
What matters is that we recover the vial.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.626
We were able to trace the routing number

05:34.793 --> 05:36.420
the informant gave Vaughn.

05:36.628 --> 05:41.383
2 million euros were deposited into the account of colonel Nikolai Voskov.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.845
The money came from this man -- Boris Tambor.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.346
The russian oil magnate?

05:46.430 --> 05:47.764
Tambor might have made his money in oil,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.225
but he's since diversified into mining, media outlets,

05:50.309 --> 05:52.561
and his latest venture, arms dealing.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.438
Seems Tambor's quite a player.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.773
High-end real estate all over Europe.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.902
He owns a fleet of sports cars -- Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Bentleys.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.612
This guy's living my junior high fantasy.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.030
Or my current one.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.199
Tambor keeps his entire operation mobile.

06:05.324 --> 06:06.992
Never stays in one place too long.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.287
Right now he's booked into the San Devotee in Monte Carlo.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.749
He takes a regular seat at the high-stakes poker table every night at 9:00.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.083
That will be your window.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.878
Your mission is to get into Tambor's suite,

06:17.961 --> 06:20.422
find out where he keeps the Black Thorine,

06:20.547 --> 06:21.840
how  he plans to move it.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.718
You leave tonight. Wheels up, 2200.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.208
You want to tell me about it?

06:59.628 --> 07:00.754
Sloane.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.924
He  was in my house.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.844
Last night. To visit Nadia.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.097
I came home. He was sitting in my living room.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.808
Oh.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.104
I thought I could do this --

07:17.521 --> 07:19.439
work for Sloane again, but now...

07:21.358 --> 07:23.902
I don't know, I think I might have been kidding myself.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.075
I dream about Diane.

07:32.035 --> 07:35.038
Which isn't unusual, I've been told,

07:35.247 --> 07:37.416
except for me,

07:37.833 --> 07:39.877
it's almost every night.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.505
These dreams

07:44.548 --> 07:45.632
are always the same.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.012
At some point I get to her,

07:50.846 --> 07:52.264
and I hold her face.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.600
And I can see it in her eyes --

07:55.976 --> 07:58.395
the disappointment in me.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.983
That I couldn't prevent what happened.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.652
Then...

08:07.029 --> 08:09.323
she tells me that she loves me,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.159
that she loves the kids,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.704
and she asks me to do the right thing.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.123
She doesn't ask me to, she tells me to.

08:19.750 --> 08:25.964
And that's how I make peace with Sloane.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.260
I don't put the past away or compartmentalize it.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.970
I transmute it.

08:34.890 --> 08:38.559
I make it the right decision today.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.482
I hope I'm capable of that.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.901
I know you are.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.594
I'm sorry about last night.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.262
It was my fault.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.139
My father's one of the reasons --

09:57.181 --> 09:59.975
You  don't have to explain. I get it.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.563
When our mother came back, she --

10:05.439 --> 10:07.774
she had done her share bad things.

10:07.983 --> 10:08.650
I know.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.905
But still, I needed to know her.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.327
I just did.

10:17.076 --> 10:17.781
Thanks.

10:21.706 --> 10:22.745
Nice shot.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.744
What's that, Gretchen?

11:01.119 --> 11:02.829
I don't buy you as a Gretchen.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.039
Nein?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.002
Whoa. Uh, okay.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.046
Okay, guys, we have one hour. You all know the drill.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.049
Surveille the room, get in, get out with the intel and the Black Thorine.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.604
Evergreen, maintain position. We're almost there.

11:33.569 --> 11:34.653
Okay, I'm in.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.280
Evergreen, you're clear.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.330
Inserting camera now.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.582
Ready for sound.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.751
Patching audio-visual feeds now.

11:50.711 --> 11:51.545
Copy that.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.257
Okay, I've got a visual on Tambor.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.474
Housekeeping.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.530
Oh, I'm sorry. I ordered a french maid.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.199
Here you go.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.536
The laptop is our first priority. After that, we go for the PDA.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.287
What the hell's going on?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.872
I thought this guy hits the tables every night by 9:00.

12:26.914 --> 12:27.789
That's what we know.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.583
Yeah, well, it's 9:06.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.668
Oh, here we go.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.425
What's he doing?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.681
Look at that room.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.849
That's nice.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.392
Check out those digs.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.441
Marshall, what soccer match is that?

12:54.525 --> 12:58.028
Uh, hold on. Let -- sorry, I'm not much of a sports fan.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.446
More of a scrabble club type.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.448
Boggle tournament if I'm feeling dangerous.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.993
Guys, Tambor owns the team.

13:06.328 --> 13:07.120
He's kidding, right?

13:07.204 --> 13:08.413
So he's in for the night.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.040
He checks out first thing tomorrow morning.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.293
If we don't get in there tonight, get the data off that computer, we lose him.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.586
Wait a minute.

13:15.671 --> 13:17.089
I hate that perfume.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.216
It was a weird patchouli smell.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.760
See under the bed? The slingbacks?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.178
Champagne bottles on the nightstand.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.263
Check out the magazines.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.472
Designer purse.

13:25.889 --> 13:26.890
It's a shot.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.141
What's a shot? What are you talking about?

13:28.225 --> 13:29.518
I know where to get what we need.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.019
Where's she going?

13:31.103 --> 13:32.229
You mind filling us in?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.690
Tambor's got a girlfriend. She's staying with him.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.816
She's our way in.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.402
We have no intel on that woman. You'll be going in blind, Sydney.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.528
We know enough.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.113
She has gossip rags all over the room,

13:41.238 --> 13:42.531
which means she's fine making a mess,

13:42.656 --> 13:43.949
so we know she's not a one-night stand.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.993
Her shoes cost more than most people's monthly salary,

13:46.118 --> 13:48.579
so she either has money of her own or access to Tambor's.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.456
Either way, empty champagne bottles, her side of the bed.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.708
This girl likes to party.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.627
But her boyfriend would rather stay in and watch TV

13:55.752 --> 13:57.838
their last night in Monaco than hang out with her,

13:57.963 --> 14:00.632
so she's bored. Most likely pissed off.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.134
How do you propose to find her?

14:02.301 --> 14:04.511
Well, she left her handbag. She didn't go far.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.347
In fact, I'm guessing she's hitting the hotel bar right now.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.473
All Nadia and I need to do

14:08.515 --> 14:10.517
is get to her and get her to take us to the room.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.103
- Why are you smiling?
- I don't know.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.608
Where'd you get this stuff?

14:17.691 --> 14:17.983
I borrowed them.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.526
You stole it, didn't you?

14:20.485 --> 14:21.695
She stole the stuff.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.864
Nadia, this could jeopardize the entire mission.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.616
Tambor's security team saw you.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.618
If they recognize you as the maid,

14:27.701 --> 14:29.453
they will not hesitate to take action.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.664
With all due respect, no one pays attention to the help.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.125
I promise they won't recognize me.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.394
Patchouli.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.525
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do you mean?

15:00.901 --> 15:03.987
Well, guess what? I'm sick of your pathetic excuses.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.074
He's not coming.

15:08.242 --> 15:10.536
You still have his charge card, right?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.454
Oh, my god.

15:13.205 --> 15:13.830
Madame?

15:14.331 --> 15:17.709
- Two. Please.
- D'accord.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.505
Men suck, don't they?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.467
Usually.

15:32.638 --> 15:36.019
I  swear to god, I am so not that clumsy.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.147
Don't listen to her. She's incapable of holding her liquor.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.774
Shut up!

15:40.899 --> 15:43.318
Need I remind you of Ibiza?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.195
You and the DJ with the handcuffs?

15:45.279 --> 15:47.739
I'm ignoring you now. Watch.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.951
Just a warning. Just a warning.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.871
My boyfriend? He's kind of a jerk.

15:53.954 --> 15:54.955
Like mine isn't.

15:57.038 --> 16:00.544
Are you just going to stand there?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.171
I'm sorry, miss Bridget.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.798
They call me miss Bridget.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.310
Okay. They're doing it.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.519
They're in the room.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.271
Mr. Sloane, I know how against this you were,

16:19.396 --> 16:21.815
but if Sydney chooses to say "I told you so"...

16:21.899 --> 16:23.358
- She's not out yet.
- That's true,

16:23.442 --> 16:26.778
but they're good. They're really good.

16:27.821 --> 16:33.410
I need five minutes to change, and we are leaving.

16:33.952 --> 16:36.330
Make yourselves at home, ladies.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.252
What's the score?

16:43.295 --> 16:45.964
Devils 1, Lautrec 3.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.674
Slovak will come back.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.677
Last year, second half against Madrid,

16:50.844 --> 16:53.013
Roscoe's diving header in extra time?

16:53.096 --> 16:54.890
The best goal ever.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.060
Beckner  is a great midfielder.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.062
Not too bad on the eyes, either.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.271
For what I'm paying him...

17:01.939 --> 17:03.023
What do you mean?

17:04.900 --> 17:06.026
It's my team.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.278
Shut up. Shut up!

17:08.444 --> 17:10.446
You own the Slovak Devils?

17:10.531 --> 17:12.074
Felicia, did you hear that?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.076
She's cloning the hard drive, and he's in the room.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.286
How the hell does she know about the Slovak Devils?

17:16.369 --> 17:16.869
Was that in the file?

17:16.954 --> 17:18.038
Maybe she's a soccer fan.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.665
Oh, god, this is the greatest girl ever.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.295
She got it.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.089
I didn't know you liked soccer.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.591
I do now. Oh, by the way, it's called futbol.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.051
- I'm sorry.
- Futbol.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.762
- Futbol.
- Fut. Right. Right.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.639
If I can be honest,

17:35.764 --> 17:38.267
the back four are solid, no question,

17:38.392 --> 17:40.769
but watching defensive footie is a little bit boring.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.312
- Not to me, huh.
- It's your money.

17:42.437 --> 17:46.024
Donata, can you believe that hag is dating the prince of Greece?

17:46.191 --> 17:49.778
Oh, god. Doesn't she have any friends who can tell her she looks like trash?

17:49.862 --> 17:52.322
Did you see that? She just palmed the PDA from his jacket.

17:52.656 --> 17:53.657
That's magic, man.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.367
I showed her that with, like, a business card.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.786
It's like, fazham! She's amazing.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.371
- I get it.
- She's incredible.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.165
- Fazham?
- Yeah, fazham.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.418
Nice. They're doing it.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.129
They're cloning tambor's PDA. She's good.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.173
Oh, my god, those boots are horrific.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.508
I own those, bitch.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.012
Wouldn't be weird for you, would it, if we were dating sisters?

18:20.017 --> 18:23.729
Reno's lost his step since the knee surgery. You should replace him.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.356
Idiot!

18:29.651 --> 18:31.820
Nadia's still got his PDA. Come on.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.788
Extraordinary.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.874
Oh, my god.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.293
That dress is magnificent.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.212
- My PDA.
- Oh, god.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.923
Anton!

18:51.131 --> 18:53.634
Search these two. Check their bags.

18:53.717 --> 18:54.968
- You can't be serious.
- Where did you find them?

18:55.052 --> 18:56.762
My god, this is insane.

19:01.642 --> 19:04.061
Is this what you're freaking out about?

19:09.274 --> 19:12.611
- You better go now.
- Yeah, you think?

19:13.028 --> 19:15.906
You were right. Your boyfriend is a total drag. Come on.

19:27.543 --> 19:29.169
You were given a direct order,

19:29.837 --> 19:31.547
one you chose to disregard.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.340
We gathered the necessary intelligence.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.050
That is not the point, Nadia.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.136
You report directly to me.

19:38.637 --> 19:41.849
I assessed the risks and determined that they were too great,

19:41.932 --> 19:45.143
and still you both chose to defy orders.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.771
We did what we were tasked to do, end of story.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.857
I should remind you.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.150
You answer to me.

19:53.861 --> 19:54.611
You're right.

19:54.695 --> 19:57.990
We disregarded a direct order. It won't happen again.

19:58.949 --> 20:01.118
Just so we don't have these misunderstandings again,

20:01.201 --> 20:02.786
let me be clear

20:02.911 --> 20:04.538
to both of you.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.957
Questioning my authority,

20:07.124 --> 20:09.501
whether it's in this office or in the field,

20:10.502 --> 20:12.421
is unacceptable.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.214
Unacceptable?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.341
Coming from you, that's almost funny.

20:16.425 --> 20:17.593
Sydney, please.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.972
Do you really want to engage in a conversation about what is

20:22.431 --> 20:26.310
and what is not acceptable?

20:27.436 --> 20:29.479
Every day I work here,

20:29.563 --> 20:32.691
I see your face in briefings, I hear your voice in my ear during missions,

20:32.733 --> 20:36.612
and you want to know what it's like? It makes me sick to my stomach.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.781
Having to pretend the past never happened,

20:39.865 --> 20:41.950
that you're not the same

20:42.075 --> 20:45.829
murderous criminal sociopath you were three years ago,

20:45.954 --> 20:47.873
it makes me want to retch.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.959
If you want to talk unacceptable,

20:51.335 --> 20:53.378
that is unacceptable.

20:55.422 --> 20:59.676
I assumed that you had accepted the fact that I made amends for my past.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.055
Amends?

21:06.058 --> 21:07.935
Francie and Danny are gone,

21:09.520 --> 21:11.647
and yet here you are.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.817
And everywhere I look,

21:15.901 --> 21:18.278
I'm reminded of the man who killed them.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.824
I see.

21:25.202 --> 21:27.371
Hey, uh, Tambor's encryption program --

21:27.454 --> 21:28.163
I broke it.

21:28.247 --> 21:29.790
It was kind of brilliant on my part,

21:29.873 --> 21:31.875
but then again the data itself was coded,

21:31.959 --> 21:32.876
so I had to cross-reference it --

21:32.960 --> 21:33.877
Marshall, what is it?

21:34.002 --> 21:35.921
Well, it looks like the sale of Black Thorine --

21:36.171 --> 21:37.923
it's going down in 16 hours.

21:38.382 --> 21:40.717
- We'll be right there.
- Okay. You should hurry.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.525
The situation is critical.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.901
Tambor is selling the Black Thorine

21:58.026 --> 21:59.736
aboard his yacht, the Argento.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.572
We have less than 16 hours to get on that boat

22:01.697 --> 22:03.115
and retrieve the stolen vial.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.950
According to harbor master records,

22:05.075 --> 22:08.662
the Argento is sailing in the black sea in protected waters off Turkey,

22:08.829 --> 22:11.248
which  means we have no choice but to go in stealth

22:11.331 --> 22:12.583
without the cover of night.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.209
Do we know who the buyer is?

22:14.418 --> 22:17.379
No, but we do have an idea where the Black Thorine is being stored.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.090
Here, in a cabin below dark.

22:20.591 --> 22:21.383
Marshall.

22:21.508 --> 22:26.013
Okay, here is the schematic of the vault that you'll be dealing with.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.473
It's secure, built into the bulkhead, old school.

22:28.515 --> 22:33.604
So whoever is going in, you are going to need...

22:33.812 --> 22:34.938
these.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.733
Uh, your basic safecracking tools.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.484
- Sounds simple.
- Not quite.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.987
Now, I found some receipts on tambor's hard drive.

22:42.112 --> 22:46.283
Turns out he bought a condor TL-60 free-standing safe last month.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.618
I did some measurements,

22:47.701 --> 22:50.037
and oddly enough, it fits perfectly within the vault,

22:50.120 --> 22:54.249
so I think it's safe to assume Tambor has a safe within a safe.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.918
He's certainly paranoid enough.

22:56.001 --> 22:56.793
How do we crack it?

22:56.960 --> 22:59.421
The condor uses a time-synchronized lock.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.673
It randomizes a combination every 60 seconds.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.593
Now, the combination appears on a key card with an LCD screen.

23:04.718 --> 23:08.722
Now, we can assume that Tambor will have it on him, so...

23:09.014 --> 23:10.390
you're gonna need this.

23:10.599 --> 23:15.646
This is a handheld wireless monitor, and this right here --

23:15.854 --> 23:17.940
Will you marry me, mr. Bristow?

23:20.984 --> 23:23.695
It's a wave millimeter camera.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.448
It will allow you to read the combination through his clothing,

23:26.615 --> 23:29.743
assuming he's not wearing a lead girdle, which is doubtful.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.453
But you understand my point.

23:31.537 --> 23:32.663
There's a jet standing by.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.665
This is a high-risk mission. No backup.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.000
Vaughn, Dixon, this is your op.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.919
I'm sending you to the ship.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.421
If you don't mind, I'd like to finish what I started.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.215
So would I.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.552
They are the two best divers.

23:46.677 --> 23:48.804
For me to send them after the way they behaved in Monte Carlo,

23:48.887 --> 23:51.640
not to mention the way Sydney just behaved in my office,

23:51.765 --> 23:54.935
would be tantamount to rewarding them for insubordination.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.481
I thought I would have your support on this.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.861
Arvin, the nuance of fatherhood may elude me,

24:03.944 --> 24:06.280
but there's one thing I am sure of.

24:06.780 --> 24:09.199
You are not going to forge any kind of bond with Nadia

24:09.324 --> 24:12.870
if you attempt to keep her from working with her sister.

24:35.184 --> 24:37.644
I told him, if you don't win us next game,

24:37.853 --> 24:40.731
you're going to suffer a painful training injury, huh?

24:45.149 --> 24:47.905
Is that why you doubled his salary?

24:52.084 --> 24:52.743
Ha.

25:02.044 --> 25:04.171
Phoenix to base, we're on deck.

25:04.296 --> 25:05.547
Proceed with caution.

25:05.672 --> 25:06.840
Copy that. We're moving in.

25:11.303 --> 25:12.346
We're going below deck.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.473
We'll be radio silent until we reach the safe.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.557
Roger that.

25:28.445 --> 25:30.864
Black label. But of course.

25:36.411 --> 25:38.956
Phoenix, we have a visual.

25:39.122 --> 25:41.041
Copy that. Switching to millimeter wave.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.126
Freeze it there. Save it.

25:43.252 --> 25:45.629
Stand by. Enhancing the image.

25:48.257 --> 25:51.552
I always believe in pleasure before business.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.805
But, that being said...

25:54.847 --> 25:57.516
Marshall, rewind the feed.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.893
Is there a problem?

26:00.894 --> 26:03.522
Pull up everything we have on Leo Orissa.

26:04.523 --> 26:07.234
Leo Orissa...

26:07.860 --> 26:08.277
okay.

26:12.072 --> 26:15.200
Anton, get the man what he came for, huh?

26:16.034 --> 26:17.619
If you don't mind,

26:17.744 --> 26:22.124
I would like first for my chemist to conduct a little test, uh...

26:22.416 --> 26:23.584
a precaution.

26:23.667 --> 26:32.801
- Ready.
- Copy that.

26:33.135 --> 26:35.512
Scanning Tambor for the latest combination.

26:36.013 --> 26:40.601
Code is 4-2-6-8-7.

26:42.895 --> 26:44.188
Oh, my god.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.064
We need a bigger case.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.155
Close it up -- now.

27:10.839 --> 27:12.841
So, you never told me --

27:12.925 --> 27:15.302
what do you plan to do with your purchase?

27:15.552 --> 27:17.971
It is interesting, actually.

27:19.598 --> 27:24.102
We plan on taking control of your entire operation.

27:26.438 --> 27:27.940
This guy...

27:29.816 --> 27:30.984
You know this guy?

27:31.151 --> 27:32.569
He's an old friend.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.029
Bad-ass friend.

28:33.881 --> 28:36.341
You don't treat a girlfriend like that.

28:52.858 --> 28:54.985
Phoenix, Evergreen, do you copy?

28:55.611 --> 28:57.821
I repeat, do you copy?

29:13.128 --> 29:14.296
Phoenix to base.

29:14.463 --> 29:17.090
Tambor and his men are dead.

29:17.591 --> 29:18.675
Ambushed.

29:18.926 --> 29:22.221
By Leo Orissa, head of a russian organized crime syndicate.

29:22.429 --> 29:26.558
I used to work with him when I was head of SD-6.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.354
He has a link on the inside.

29:30.479 --> 29:32.147
The girlfriend fed him everything he needed.

29:32.231 --> 29:33.524
They're in possession of the vial?

29:33.649 --> 29:35.067
A lot more than a vial.

29:35.150 --> 29:36.485
At least 10 canisters.

29:36.693 --> 29:38.737
10 more -- must have reverse-engineered it.

29:38.904 --> 29:41.323
Which means they're manufacturing it. Tambor has a lab somewhere.

29:41.406 --> 29:42.824
Orissa must know where it is.

29:42.991 --> 29:47.579
Orissa's associates are most likely securing the Black Thorine for transport.

29:47.663 --> 29:49.331
Nadia, can you take them out alone?

29:49.498 --> 29:50.832
I think so.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.751
Given my history with Orissa,

29:52.876 --> 29:54.670
I believe he'd be willing to talk.

29:54.837 --> 29:55.921
How?

29:56.463 --> 29:58.298
Sydney, in order for this to work,

29:58.382 --> 30:00.175
you're going to have to listen to me.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.511
You're going to have to trust me.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.247
Hello again.

30:32.541 --> 30:34.918
My employer won't be happy if you pull that trigger.

30:35.127 --> 30:36.503
Your employer?

30:36.879 --> 30:38.672
Who the hell do you work for?

30:39.047 --> 30:40.174
Tell him.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.302
I work for Arvin Sloane.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.691
He's demanding 50%?

30:57.774 --> 31:00.527
Including all future profits from this venture.

31:01.361 --> 31:04.781
Arvin always had an odd sense of humor.

31:04.948 --> 31:10.954
I came unarmed out of respect so that we could talk like gentlemen.

31:11.121 --> 31:14.208
You are not seriously considering making a deal with this woman.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.335
Do not let her derail this, Sydney.

31:16.502 --> 31:18.420
I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.465
You're the one who made it easy.

31:21.632 --> 31:23.967
You practically drew us a map.

31:24.051 --> 31:27.179
You? You led Sloane to me?

31:27.221 --> 31:29.223
I thought she was just some kind of --

31:39.483 --> 31:40.442
Fine.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.445
I agree to his terms.

31:44.530 --> 31:45.739
Ask for insurance.

31:45.906 --> 31:47.533
Mr. Sloane will be pleased.

31:49.409 --> 31:51.453
Of course, he needs a sign of good faith.

31:51.870 --> 31:54.039
What more does he want?

31:54.164 --> 31:55.999
The location of the lab.

31:58.669 --> 31:59.753
Don't move.

32:09.596 --> 32:13.141
Mention my friend, dr. Chaleb.

32:14.017 --> 32:15.561
What I did to him

32:16.687 --> 32:18.564
after he betrayed me.

32:18.772 --> 32:22.109
I assume you haven't forgotten dr. Chaleb.

32:22.234 --> 32:23.527
What sloane did to him.

32:24.486 --> 32:27.322
The sound of his own screaming woke him up.

32:28.323 --> 32:31.660
He saw everything burning around him,

32:32.369 --> 32:34.288
including his own flesh.

32:35.414 --> 32:40.711
The fire, the smell of his own flesh burning, the screams.

32:40.836 --> 32:45.007
I imagine he spends his days, nights

32:45.174 --> 32:47.467
wishing that I had finished the job.

32:48.552 --> 32:50.179
Wishing that he were dead.

32:51.054 --> 32:55.392
His body doesn't work, but his mind does.

32:56.435 --> 32:58.061
He's a living corpse.

33:00.022 --> 33:03.483
Sloane didn't show enough mercy to kill him.

33:13.702 --> 33:16.830
Let me tell you something I know.

33:17.706 --> 33:19.541
Arvin Sloane is cruel.

33:21.168 --> 33:22.669
He's inhuman.

33:24.129 --> 33:25.380
If you make this difficult,

33:25.506 --> 33:27.257
he will come after you.

33:27.382 --> 33:29.384
And not just you.

33:29.718 --> 33:31.678
Your friends will not be spared.

33:33.847 --> 33:36.808
Your family will not be spared.

33:38.936 --> 33:40.979
If he chooses to let you live,

33:43.774 --> 33:48.195
you'll spend every waking minute of your life reminded of what he's caused you.

33:49.863 --> 33:54.868
Word to the wise -- give him what he wants.

34:09.132 --> 34:14.429
The lab -- it's in the ukraine. Khmel'nitsky.

34:14.554 --> 34:16.223
You son of a bitch!

35:09.693 --> 35:12.029
Phoenix to base. We're ready for pickup.

35:12.154 --> 35:14.740
You have no idea how glad I am to hear that.

35:14.865 --> 35:15.991
I'll call the chopper.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.411
Arvin.

35:22.664 --> 35:24.208
You did what you had to do.

35:24.833 --> 35:25.918
Yes.

35:27.336 --> 35:30.506
Although I imagine it's the last time I'll be working with your daughter.

36:02.329 --> 36:03.539
You did a good job.

36:04.122 --> 36:05.707
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

36:09.711 --> 36:11.843
I never imagined this.

36:11.968 --> 36:16.093
I didn't even know spies were real until I was recruited.

36:16.176 --> 36:17.010
From school?

36:17.928 --> 36:20.180
From our juvenile detention home.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.933
When I was young, I was reckless...

36:23.016 --> 36:24.226
angry.

36:25.394 --> 36:28.480
I remember one judge said he thought I was lost.

36:29.022 --> 36:30.607
He wasn't wrong.

36:33.735 --> 36:35.988
My training agent used to tell me I was

36:36.071 --> 36:38.866
good at getting in and out of situations without being noticed.

36:39.408 --> 36:42.369
Not to mention I had no one -- no family, no ties.

36:44.872 --> 36:47.916
I couldn't be compromised because I was alone.

36:51.962 --> 36:55.591
I always thought that's what made me a good spy.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.219
And now?

37:00.929 --> 37:02.264
I might have been wrong.

37:28.707 --> 37:31.126
- Just say stop anywhere.
- Stop.

37:31.502 --> 37:32.711
Okay.

37:34.004 --> 37:35.339
Is that your card?

37:35.756 --> 37:36.673
No.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.300
This wasn't your card?

37:38.383 --> 37:39.384
It is not.

37:39.885 --> 37:40.761
Are you sure?

37:40.969 --> 37:42.721
It's not at all my card.

37:42.888 --> 37:45.641
Okay, i think you're lying, but hold on to that.

37:45.682 --> 37:47.434
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

37:47.768 --> 37:48.769
Well, that's never happened.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.187
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on one second.

37:50.270 --> 37:52.523
- What was your card?
- Queen of spades.

37:53.148 --> 37:55.567
The queen of spades? You said that wasn't your card.

37:55.651 --> 37:57.277
It is not.

37:57.945 --> 37:59.488
How did you do that?

37:59.571 --> 38:00.572
This is incredible.

38:00.656 --> 38:03.617
Well, it's not incredible. It's child's play. I've got a million of them.

38:04.201 --> 38:07.037
Your smile is so unbelievable.

38:08.205 --> 38:09.248
We going?

38:09.414 --> 38:11.500
Uh, yeah, we're going. We're just flirting here if you mind.

38:11.583 --> 38:12.459
Sorry.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.012
Langley is pleased.

38:25.389 --> 38:29.184
They located the production facility for Black Thorine.

38:29.268 --> 38:31.645
The raid was successful.

38:32.604 --> 38:34.106
I'm happy to hear it.

38:36.567 --> 38:38.610
So, Sydney, I contacted Chase.

38:38.735 --> 38:42.739
She's expecting a call from you regarding a transfer from this unit.

38:43.740 --> 38:47.077
Given your sentiments, I assume that's what you want.

38:49.913 --> 38:51.540
I want to make something clear.

38:57.045 --> 39:02.134
I will never forgive you for what you've done to me,

39:03.135 --> 39:04.887
to the people I love.

39:08.182 --> 39:11.226
No amount of time or distance will ever change that.

39:20.611 --> 39:22.070
I'll see you tomorrow.
