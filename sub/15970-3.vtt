(theme music playing)

01:06.680 --> 01:09.200
(crowd applauding on TV)

01:09.280 --> 01:12.160
(man on TV)<i> I do not believe that</i>
<i>any of us...</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:15.560
<i>would exchange places</i>
<i>with any other people</i>

01:15.640 --> 01:17.360
<i>or any other generation.</i>

01:18.400 --> 01:20.960
<i>The energy, the faith,</i>
<i>the devotion...</i>

01:21.040 --> 01:24.240
(Angela) <i>Grownups like to tell you where</i>
<i>they were when president Kennedy was shot,</i>

01:24.320 --> 01:26.320
<i>which they all know to the exact</i>
<i>second...</i>

01:27.200 --> 01:29.360
<i>which makes me almost jealous...</i>

01:30.520 --> 01:32.760
<i>like I should have</i>
<i>something important enough to know</i>

01:32.840 --> 01:36.720
<i>where I was when it happened...</i>
<i>but I don't yet.</i>

01:36.800 --> 01:39.400
(man on TV)<i> Ask what you can do</i>
<i>for your country.</i>

01:39.480 --> 01:41.640
(crowd applauding on TV)

01:45.800 --> 01:47.960
(Angela)<i> And the fact</i>
<i>that it was a better time then</i>

01:48.040 --> 01:51.560
<i>and people knew what they were supposed</i>
<i>to do and how to make the world better.</i>

01:52.200 --> 01:54.320
<i>Now nobody knows anything.</i>

01:55.440 --> 01:58.160
(thunder rumbling)

01:58.240 --> 02:01.400
<i>We know who's popular</i>
<i>or that social studies is boring...</i>

02:02.000 --> 02:04.280
<i>or that Brian always</i>
<i>has stomach trouble...</i>

02:08.200 --> 02:10.760
<i>but nobody knows</i>
<i>anything important.</i>

02:18.880 --> 02:22.440
Don't! Stop! I can't. Let go!
Please!

02:24.200 --> 02:26.960
(man on TV)<i> Strength and sacrifice,</i>
<i>which we ask of you.</i>

02:27.040 --> 02:28.720
(Angela)
<i>Instead of changing the world,</i>

02:28.800 --> 02:30.960
<i>people sit in class and write notes</i>
<i>about other people</i>

02:31.040 --> 02:33.000
(man on TV)
<i>Our only sure reward...</i>

02:34.880 --> 02:38.160
<i>with history the final</i>
<i>judge of our deeds...</i>

02:38.760 --> 02:41.640
(on TV)<i> Let us go forth</i>
<i>to lead the land we love...</i>

02:42.520 --> 02:45.560
<i>asking his blessing</i>
<i>and his help...</i>

02:46.480 --> 02:48.440

02:49.080 --> 02:51.960
<i>God's work must truly</i>

02:52.040 --> 02:53.920
(gunshot)

03:00.760 --> 03:03.480
(intense music playing)

03:07.920 --> 03:10.880
(indistinct chatter)

03:16.760 --> 03:17.840
That's my soda!

03:19.840 --> 03:21.080
Gross!

03:21.640 --> 03:26.160
Get back! Get back! Get back!
Get back! Stay back! Be quiet!

03:27.160 --> 03:28.240
Did you see who it was?

03:30.920 --> 03:32.440
Did you?

03:32.520 --> 03:35.080
(tense music playing)

03:44.760 --> 03:46.160
I cannot believe it.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.160
That's the weirdest thing that
ever happened at this school ever.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.760
We were just sitting in our classrooms
just minding our own business.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.640
And look, I could have been right
at that spot.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.560
I was there, like, 10 minutes earlier.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.880
What's the big deal? It's not like
anybody even got a flesh wound.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.960
A bottle of soda
was shot tragically.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.440
I don't want our school
to have a reputation.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.680
Like yours, you mean?

04:10.280 --> 04:13.280
Everybody knows there's, like, 50 guns
in school at any given moment.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.640
The fact that they haven't gone off before
shows what a totally safe place this is.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.600
Give it a rest!

04:20.680 --> 04:22.480
Jeez! Excuse me.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.560
Excuse me.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.080
No one's going to get shot,
I promise.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.840
(indistinct conversations)

04:32.920 --> 04:34.280
Who'd write a note like that?

04:34.360 --> 04:37.400
Everybody writes notes like
that. We write notes like that.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.920
Yeah, We write notes
that are true.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.880
-This isn't true?
-Rayanne!

04:42.480 --> 04:45.000
-We barely made out.
-(Rayanne chuckles)

04:45.080 --> 04:46.360
You haven't been telling people.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.240
Oh, Angela, come on.
Hey, Rickie.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.080
I wouldn't blab about your
personal life, I promise you.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.240
What are you looking at?

04:55.920 --> 04:57.040
What happened to your shirt?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.200
It was nothing, it got caught on
the fence outside.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.480
-So can you believe all this?
-Did you see anything?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.840
No. I was in English.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.720
Maybe I should get a gun.
Bam! Bam!

05:06.800 --> 05:10.160
(indistinct conversations)

05:10.240 --> 05:12.800
When were you are in English?
You're scheduled for social studies.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.800
What's the difference?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.240
What's this I hear about you
and Jordan?

05:17.320 --> 05:20.480
-I can't believe this.
-You know they had sex.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.880
-Rayanne!
-That's what I heard.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.480
-(both chuckles)
-You, heard it too? God, just shoot me.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.600
-We could probably arrange that.
-You mean you didn't have sex?

05:28.680 --> 05:31.080
(Rayanne chuckles)
Angela, come on. Come.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.560
You've got to start thinking
of this as a positive thing.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.120
This could help you get
to the next level with Jordan.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.880
Okay, Did he at least think
you were a good kisser?

05:41.960 --> 05:44.360
-I don't know.
-Did you like the way he kissed?

05:45.200 --> 05:48.240
They weren't the kind of kisses
you could actually evaluate.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.400
They were...
introductory kisses.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.760
You should have had sex with him.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.600
(dog barks)

06:00.560 --> 06:01.600
(sighs)

06:03.640 --> 06:05.320
Where were you
when the gun went off?

06:05.400 --> 06:08.280
It wasn't anywhere near us.
We barely heard it.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.560
We have to worry about our kids
being shot in school.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.640
How did it come to this?

06:14.720 --> 06:15.560
This is horrible.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.560
-This is a disgrace to all of us.
-That's too much.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.720
I'm sorry, honey. I'm gonna say it
in this meeting, I'm, I mean it.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.160
We have to draw
the line somewhere.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.360
We can't just keep accepting
the total deterioration...

06:27.440 --> 06:29.400
The only thing shot
was a bottle of soda.

06:29.480 --> 06:32.360
I don't even know if you should
go there alone anymore.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.640
Maybe we should drop you
off every morning.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.400
-Dad.
-I know the gun was in the school.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.600
We can't be with her all day.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.200
We're not going to change
our entire lives over this.

06:40.280 --> 06:44.480
It was one stupid gunshot.
You're not dropping me at school.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.040
God! I'm not an 8-year-old.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.960
At my school, a kid slipped
on this wet spot, fell...

06:51.760 --> 06:52.840
like, on his face.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.840
Maybe we should take her
out of school...

06:59.760 --> 07:01.360
put her in private school.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.920
I wish we could afford that.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.480
Maybe that's not an excuse. Maybe
we should just sacrifice other things.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.280
Like the house in Palm Beach?

07:10.280 --> 07:12.480
This is our daughter
we're talking about.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.840
I know.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.640
I don't know
why the world's gone so crazy,

07:18.720 --> 07:20.520
and I don't know what to do about it.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.120
I wish we could... keep them
in some kind of bubble

07:25.200 --> 07:28.400
to protect them,
but, uh... I know we can't.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.720
I'm not asking for a bubble.

07:31.800 --> 07:36.120
How about just a place they can live
and walk to school and become grownups

07:36.200 --> 07:39.600
without having to worry about guns
and aids and serial murderers?

07:39.680 --> 07:42.960
That didn't used to be exotic.
That wasn't the province of the rich.

07:43.040 --> 07:47.200
We all had that...
why can't they have that?

07:48.720 --> 07:50.200
I don't know.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.680
(girl)
Stretch out.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.840
-(indistinct conversations)
-(whistle blows)

08:02.920 --> 08:05.400
Let's go, guys. Hustle. Come on,
hustle. Hustle. Hustle, concentrate.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.000
There. Did you see that?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.560
-See what?
-That guy.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.200
People are looking at me.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.640
-That's good.
-They're looking at me.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.960
Oh, they're looking at you.

08:18.040 --> 08:23.120
-(indistinct conversations)
-(team claps, cheers)

08:27.000 --> 08:28.640
-All right.
-Hi.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.400
Hi.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.840
See? What was that about?

08:36.920 --> 08:38.720
-He said hi.
-That was not hi.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.360
-That was a hi.
-That was a different hi.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.360
It was a...
he-wants-to-get-to-know-you hi.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.960
From someone who never talks
to me, has never talked to me,

08:47.040 --> 08:48.320
would never talk to me.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.960
Except now he thinks you
put out, so he talks to you.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.120
-I told you that note was good!
-Rayanne

08:55.080 --> 08:57.640
-(whistle blows)
-Let's slam!

08:59.440 --> 09:01.320
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.360
-Don't be ridiculous.
-That's it.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.360
It's a very guy thing to do.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.280
-Hey, Catalano.
-Hi.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.040
So what about this gun thing,
huh?

09:15.840 --> 09:18.560
I'd hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat!

09:18.640 --> 09:21.520
-(indistinct conversations)
-(intense music playing)

09:28.080 --> 09:29.200
Stop!

09:37.120 --> 09:38.680
Don't bug me, man!

09:38.760 --> 09:41.640
-(indistinct conversations)
-(intense music playing)

09:46.360 --> 09:47.880
So, do you know
what everyone's saying?

09:47.960 --> 09:51.240
-What?
-About you and Angela having sex.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.880
Who?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.200
-You and Angela.
-No. Who's saying that?

09:56.280 --> 10:00.120
People.
She told me the truth of course.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.680
What truth?

10:05.120 --> 10:06.600
How far you guys went.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.280
Well... yeah...
'cause nothing happened.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.560
All right,
so how come it's all over school?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.120
I mean, you're not talking it up
like some lowlife,

10:17.200 --> 10:20.680
derelict cretin telling everyone
you did her, are you?

10:20.760 --> 10:24.720
(indistinct conversations)

10:25.400 --> 10:26.800
Just checking.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.160
Hi, Brian.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.280
Hi.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.760
-This is Gina.
-Hey.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.720
-Right. Hi.
-Brian saw the entire thing.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.880
-I heard you chased the gunman.
-Chased the gunman?

10:40.960 --> 10:42.160
I would have just screamed.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.920
I have to leave the room
when my father uses the electric knife.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.080
Well, I think "Chase"
is a little bit strong,

10:50.160 --> 10:52.200
but, I was going to check out
the situation.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.080
Because If there's a gun...

10:55.320 --> 10:56.600
Mr. Foster.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.400
Mr. Krakow,
still getting those as?

10:59.480 --> 11:01.840
-Yes, sir.
-That's real good, Mr. Krakow.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.680
Come to my office for a few minutes.
I need to ask you few things.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.120
Well, actually, I have a class.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.800
You're excused from
your next class, Mr. Krakow.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.960
Oh, really? Great.
I mean, of course.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.200
(locker closes)

11:17.960 --> 11:20.840
(intense music playing)

11:25.200 --> 11:26.680
There she is.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.920
(bell ringing)

11:31.560 --> 11:33.640
(tense music playing)

11:58.360 --> 12:01.080
These are some grades. Have you
always gotten grades like this?

12:01.840 --> 12:03.120
Yes, sir.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.840
We need more kids
in our school like you, Brian.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.880
All the schools
need more kids like you.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.200
You're on a valedictorian path,
Mr. Krakow.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.520
All your teachers give you
an unqualified thumbs-up.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.840
So... what happened yesterday?

12:30.200 --> 12:31.640
Well, I already told
Mr. Higgins.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.640
But I'd like to hear it
from you.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.600
Right.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.440
I was leaving the bathroom,
and I heard a shot.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.320
You were in the bathroom
because...

12:41.600 --> 12:42.680
Because?

12:43.480 --> 12:46.120
-I... had to go to the bathroom.
-Which one?

12:46.840 --> 12:50.280
-The one by the...
-No, I meant what kind?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.520
How long were you
in the bathroom?

12:57.800 --> 13:00.000
Well, I didn't actually go.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.080
I had a stomach-ache,
but I didn't actually go.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.080
Because?

13:09.640 --> 13:11.280
because you heard something
in the hall.

13:13.240 --> 13:17.840
I heard a scuffle, but I didn't see anyone
when I came out. I just heard the shot.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.160
You heard a scuffle loud enough
to keep you from taking nature's call,

13:22.240 --> 13:24.600
but you didn't see anything.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.800
No, sir.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.920
Brian, I don't have to tell you
that this is a serious criminal act

13:33.000 --> 13:34.240
we're talking about here.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.360
Yes, sir.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.440
I'd hate to hear that you
were protecting someone...

13:39.200 --> 13:41.480
with your unblemished record
and all.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.400
I'm not protecting anyone.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.200
(door closes)

13:58.040 --> 14:01.120
(man) Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen, please!

14:01.200 --> 14:02.800
for the safety of our children.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.960
Ladies and gentlemen, could I have
your undivided attention for one moment?

14:08.360 --> 14:12.480
Please can I have your attention?
Your undivided attention.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.640
(woman shushing)

14:16.080 --> 14:17.120
Thank you.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.160
I just wanted to let you know
some of the things

14:19.240 --> 14:22.760
we've been pursuing to ensure
a safe environment here at Liberty.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.840
We will not tolerate violence
in our schools.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.880
We will not accept it,
and we wouldn't mark to live with it.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.280
but all the safety measures in the world

14:30.360 --> 14:34.840
won't work unless I have
the cooperation of you, all of you.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.920
Yeah. People at these meetings are the
people who let their kids have guns.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.360
Are you getting the guns
out of school?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.600
That's the only question
that important to you.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.080
We're going to open this up for
your comments in just one moment. Please.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.800
My daughter has been in tears
for 36 hours.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.760
We're not going to live
with this terror in the school.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.240
One moment, please.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.120
We're getting nowhere fast
if each of us speaks out of turn.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.040
Now... as I was saying
to your point, Madame,

15:01.120 --> 15:03.920
Ms. Szowizki is going to provide
special counseling

15:04.000 --> 15:07.560
for any student who has
a problem coping with the incident.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.360
Ooh, that is good.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.160
Put the kids in therapy
so they can adjust to being shot.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.320
...what everybody has to say.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.360
If we could just say it
one at a time.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.800
Excuse me, Mr. Principal
could I just...

15:18.880 --> 15:23.040
What would help if everyone would say
your name and the name of your child's.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.200
My name's Amber Vallone.
I have a daughter, Rayanne Graff,

15:26.280 --> 15:29.040
who I leave in your capable
hands every day.

15:29.120 --> 15:34.040
I'd like to know, while you're bringing
in counsellors and being all upset,

15:34.120 --> 15:37.600
should I just send my daughter to school
in a bulletproof vest every day,

15:37.680 --> 15:42.720
or are you going to do something
about guns in school?

15:42.800 --> 15:46.960
It's not the lack of economic opportunity
or the poor home life

15:47.040 --> 15:51.200
or the lack of values, but the guns.
You know, the things that shoot.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.440
Are you going to get them
out of the school?

15:53.520 --> 15:57.960
(applauding)

15:58.880 --> 16:00.720
Yeah, I'd like to see it happen.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.800
Hey, you know, I really liked
what you had to say in there.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.400
(woman chuckles)

16:06.480 --> 16:10.560
-I wish that I could be that...
-What, loud? Obnoxious?

16:11.080 --> 16:12.200
Forceful.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.200
-I'm Patty Chase.
-Hi.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.280
-Angela's mom.
-Oh, wow! Angela!

16:19.360 --> 16:21.640
Rayanne talks about her
all the time.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.120
She's in love with her.
She wants to be Angela.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.760
Really? Gosh,
they seem so different.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.480
Kids find one person
and can't get enough of them.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.000
It's like being in love without
being allowed to have sex.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.520
-Right.
-(car engine starts)

16:36.600 --> 16:37.640
No, don't you remember?

16:37.720 --> 16:42.960
There'd be, like, this one person
who had, like, perfect hair

16:43.040 --> 16:46.680
or prefect breasts
or they were just so funny,

16:46.760 --> 16:48.440
and you just wanted
to eat them up,

16:48.520 --> 16:51.280
live in their bed,
and just be them.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.480
It's like everybody else was in black
and white and that person was in color.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.920
Rayanne thinks Angela
is in color, major color.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.680
Thanks.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.960
So, how is Rayanne handling
this whole incident?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.240
She's great.
I'm the basket case.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.920
Angela's just the same.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.080
"Who's going to shoot me
with this bod, ma," she says.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.360
They think they're immortal, and
they have other things on their mind.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.720
(woman yells)

17:19.800 --> 17:23.280
Speaking of which,
Jordan is unbelievable.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.720
Your daughter has complete
taste.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.440
Excuse me.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.720
Rayanne showed me
his yearbook picture.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.800
If I were Angela
running around with him,

17:33.880 --> 17:36.480
I wouldn't give a damn about
guns in this school either.

17:37.800 --> 17:44.040
So you think that... Jordan has...
gotten in the way for Angela?

17:44.120 --> 17:47.320
And she was so obsessed
with him all that time,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.880
and wham bam!
It's actually happening,

17:49.960 --> 17:51.280
but we know
what that's like, right?

17:51.360 --> 17:53.240
Young love or lust.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.160
-What's the difference?
-(Patty chuckles)

17:56.080 --> 17:58.040
-Wham bam!
-Yeah!

17:59.280 --> 18:01.200
-Jordan.
-Hmm.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.960
I could have died. I did die.
This woman knows, and I don't know.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.640
She not a woman. She's this
40-year-old girl. She's gorgeous.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.280
She's telling me about my daughter's
sex life, which apparently she now has,

18:13.360 --> 18:15.320
-and I don't even know about it.
-Kids talk.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.640
The girl talked to her mother.
We don't know if it's true.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.840
These things are always true.
Of course, it's true.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.760
-Here, taste this.
-I couldn't taste anything.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.280
Guns are going off at school,
Angela's sleeping with someone.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.440
You don't know that.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.880
How is it?

18:29.960 --> 18:32.800
Even if she isn't,
which I pray is true...

18:33.480 --> 18:36.880
she obviously has some sort
of secret life completely apart from us.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.480
-This is wonderful.
-Cilantro.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.000
So, what do we do?

18:43.840 --> 18:45.720
-Do we confront her?
-Oh, God, no.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.040
I don't want to know
if it's true.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.800
What sort of attitude
are we supposed to have?

18:52.880 --> 18:54.280
Are we supposed to have
an attitude?

18:54.360 --> 18:57.400
I already have an attitude.
Maybe my mother's attitude.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.800
I don't want to get hysterical
about this.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.600
Why shouldn't I be hysterical?
She's 15. I should be hysterical.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.680
(Angela) Danielle, if you have
my sweatshirt, I'll kill you.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.000
You understand me?

19:09.320 --> 19:11.200
-Can I taste whatever it is?
-Sure.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.560
-Cilantro. I love that.
-Very good.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.400
I thought with the tomato
it would sharpen it a bit.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.880
I think it's great.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.360
Is that the phyllo stuff?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.960
Honey... who's Jordan?

19:26.640 --> 19:27.640
No one.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.320
-You mean Jordan Catalano?
-Is that his last name?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.880
I don't know. You brought it up.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.880
I met Rayanne's mom tonight.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.760
She was excited about your new
boyfriend, Jordan.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.120
Boyfriend? That's a laugh.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.520
-He's not your boyfriend?
-I barely know this person.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.480
I don't know
if I want to know this person.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.520
-Well, then, you haven't...
-What did you hear?

19:55.160 --> 19:56.560
What did she tell you?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.000
Nothing.
She didn't tell me anything.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.040
Did she say I was sleeping
with Jordan Catalano?

20:01.120 --> 20:03.040
No! I mean, no, of course not.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.520
No one said that.
That's just... well, I just wondered.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
She did.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.400
I can't believe this.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.440
I can't believe this.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.760
I hate everyone.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.400
Obviously, I told my mother.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.440
But all I said was that,
you were hot for him.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.520
-Why even tell her that?
-My mother thinks we slept together.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.880
Okay. Do you want my mother
to call your mother

20:28.960 --> 20:30.520
and tell her you didn't sleep together?

20:32.560 --> 20:34.080
Well, I can do that.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.880
-Hi, honey.
-Hey, fag.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.160
Go to hell.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.400
Meet me later.
I'll have something for you.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.080
Is that perfume I smell?

20:45.160 --> 20:47.000
You know you're boring,
don't you?

20:48.720 --> 20:49.920
Turd head, you need some.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.360
Yo, Graff, why don't you come
driving with us tonight?

20:53.440 --> 20:55.640
That would be exciting...
if I were in a coma.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.520
It'll be exciting. Later.

20:58.600 --> 21:02.440
-(indistinct conversations)
-(lockers clicking)

21:02.520 --> 21:03.800
I could have handled that.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.680
Yeah, you were doing great.

21:07.560 --> 21:11.840
I'm asking a particular
question, is it fair?

21:12.760 --> 21:14.280
What does "fair"
have to do with it?

21:14.360 --> 21:16.080
"Fair" has to do with... what?

21:16.840 --> 21:17.840
Anybody.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.280
"Fair" has to do with the right to come
to school and be able to work

21:21.360 --> 21:23.320
and not be terrified,

21:23.400 --> 21:26.520
not have your heart beating fast,
not jump at every loud noise.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.280
The right to come in
and be left alone.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.360
-No?
-Maybe not everybody's left alone anyway.

21:34.440 --> 21:35.640
Meaning what?

21:35.720 --> 21:37.320
You don't know
what goes on around here. Okay.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.040
Maybe some people have guns
for, like, to protect yourself.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.960
Maybe some people who have
guns are, like, victims, too...

21:45.440 --> 21:47.600
and they're, like,
forced to carry.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.960
You think kids with guns
are like gangsters or dealers.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.360
But you are saying that,
If somebody's threatened,

21:53.440 --> 21:55.280
it's okay to carry a gun
in school?

21:55.360 --> 21:57.120
You don't think school
authorities can protect them?

21:57.200 --> 22:00.440
Man, you don't know
what goes on around here. Yes!

22:00.520 --> 22:04.480
If I was... say I was threatened,
and I'm not saying that I am...

22:05.400 --> 22:09.040
I'd be packing in no time,
no time at all.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.760
(mellow music playing)

22:12.840 --> 22:15.240
(teacher) Very clearly stated.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.160
So what do the rest of you think
of what he just said?

22:20.160 --> 22:22.760
Should people take the law
into their own hands like that?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.200
I mean, is that the answer?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.280
Does that solve anything?

22:27.960 --> 22:31.400
Anyone. Ang-Angela... Angela?

22:33.280 --> 22:37.360
(intense music playing)

22:43.160 --> 22:45.800
My So Called Life
<i>will continue here on ABC.</i>

23:00.840 --> 23:02.440
Right before the gun went off,

23:02.520 --> 23:04.680
I was thinking about how
much I wanted that soda.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.320
Is that weird, why did I leave
with you in the first place.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.600
And what if I'd gone to get it
right at that moment?

23:10.680 --> 23:14.160
Oh, my God.
I better change my locker.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.000
What happens
when you don't sleep?

23:17.080 --> 23:20.080
I haven't slept since it happened.
It keeps coming back to me.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.400
It keeps coming back...
what was that?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.680
I just keep going over
in my mind.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.960
All my friends go by that locker
all the time. It's just...

23:31.040 --> 23:34.160
It's not even me. If somebody
had been going by there and...

23:35.200 --> 23:36.240
gotten shot.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.360
It's hard, isn't it?

23:39.240 --> 23:42.160
You don't think I could get
a... few days off, do you?

23:44.800 --> 23:46.040
Yeah. Catch you later, dude.

23:46.120 --> 23:50.400
(indistinct conversations)

23:53.960 --> 23:56.280
You're here again because
I wanted to hear your story,

23:56.360 --> 23:58.320
and detective Martinson wanted
to hear it too.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.160
I don't have anything
else to tell.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.200
Mr. Krakow,
can I tell you something?

24:03.520 --> 24:05.200
This is a good school.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.080
We want to keep it a good
school... You know what I mean?

24:08.160 --> 24:10.640
-Yes, sir.
-No, you don't, son.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.520
I've got these officers here
and the school board,

24:14.600 --> 24:18.360
the newspapers and the
television and a lot of nasty,

24:18.440 --> 24:21.360
angry parents who want to know
something about what happened.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.880
You are the person
who knows that something.

24:23.960 --> 24:28.040
Now you are standing between me
and my ability to keep this a good school.

24:28.120 --> 24:32.600
And I don't like it when people
do things to my school.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.680
You get my meaning?

24:34.760 --> 24:38.960
So tell us, what was the noise that caused
you to come out of the bathroom?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.240
(indistinct conversations)

24:43.320 --> 24:46.680
-Hey, Brian, how you doing?
-You actually know my name.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.400
Of course, I know your name.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.160
How they treating you Brian?

24:50.240 --> 24:53.560
Baseball bats, electrodes attached
to various parts of your anatomy?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.560
Excuse me. I have a class.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.400
Just remember
what happens to snitches.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.920
Hey, Brian, are you okay?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah. Sure.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.200
I'm sorry you're the person
that has to deal with this.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.760
-No problem.
-Because if you saw something,

25:08.840 --> 25:10.960
somebody really had a gun,
you should tell them.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.600
Otherwise you would be like part
of it. People are really scared, Brian.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.480
You should tell them,

25:15.560 --> 25:20.520
and you shouldn't feel bad about
that because people will thank you.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.280
-Hi, Brian.
-What?

25:24.360 --> 25:26.440
I was thinking, this all thing
about this gun and all.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.720
It really make an important
outcome for the paper.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.760
So, I was thinking that. You and
I should do an interview sometime.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.200
To let people know
what really happened.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.560
Maybe sometime after school.
What do you think?

25:36.640 --> 25:38.000
What?

25:39.040 --> 25:40.120
See you later.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.040
Has the threat of violence changed
the quality of my life at school?

25:46.720 --> 25:48.440
No, not really.
What do you mean?

25:49.360 --> 25:51.360
I don't see the point
of talking about it.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.720
Sometimes talking about
it makes people feel better.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.320
And sometimes talking
gets people into trouble.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.240
(telephone rings indistinctly)

26:00.760 --> 26:04.160
You know, people say things about people.
It doesn't mean it's true.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.480
-About who might be carrying a gun?
-About anything.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.320
Any weapon?

26:09.400 --> 26:12.200
No! Just about anything
anybody says about people.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.800
It's not always true.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.160
I think people want to believe
things about people,

26:18.240 --> 26:20.520
so they decide certain
things are true.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.720
And they don't even ask.
And it's not fair!

26:25.320 --> 26:27.000
'Cause you have to live with it
anyway.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.200
But if it's not true, the person
could always say that, couldn't they?

26:30.880 --> 26:35.160
I think if something is false, people
aren't going to keep on believing it.

26:35.240 --> 26:38.880
Usually people latch onto things
when there's a kernel of truth.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.560
That's when they get
into trouble.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.640
<i>-♪ Though my dreams ♪</i>
-(knock on door)

26:46.720 --> 26:49.240
<i>♪ It's never quite as it seems ♪</i>

26:49.320 --> 26:50.320
Knock-knock.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.440
<i>♪ Never quite as it seems ♪</i>

26:52.520 --> 26:53.760
Hi.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.240
<i>♪ I know I've felt like this</i>
<i>Before... ♪</i>

26:58.320 --> 26:59.720
Mind if I, um...

27:00.560 --> 27:03.240
-Might as well turn it off.
-No...

27:04.480 --> 27:05.520
I like it.

27:05.600 --> 27:11.360
(music playing)

27:21.960 --> 27:23.040
This is hard.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.000
We need to talk.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.560
(Angela)<i> When I was 12,</i>
<i>my mother gave me my sex talk.</i>

27:29.640 --> 27:32.040
<i>I doubt either of us</i>
<i>has fully recovered.</i>

27:32.120 --> 27:34.800
Now that you and Jordan are,
um...

27:34.880 --> 27:38.000
-Oh, my God. Mom, please.
-Angela,

27:38.080 --> 27:41.160
-I can accept that you have a boyfriend.
-I don't have a boyfriend.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.640
Fine... A pal. A male pal.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.480
Whatever word you want
to choose. The point is...

27:48.880 --> 27:50.760
I'm your mother,
and I don't think you're ready.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.720
-Mom, please!
-I don't think you're ready.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.240
But... I have to know
if this is what's happening

27:56.320 --> 27:59.240
because... I don't think
I can keep you...

27:59.320 --> 28:03.320
-Mom, I beg you to stop.
-I need to know you're using...

28:03.400 --> 28:06.360
I mean, I remember
how this feels. I do.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.640
But... it's the times
that we live in.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.960
-Mom, please.
-Honey,

28:12.040 --> 28:13.760
I know you don't want to think
about these things.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.360
-I know, you think you're invulnerable...
-I don't think that.

28:16.440 --> 28:21.200
You have to use some kind of protection
if you're going to be...

28:21.280 --> 28:24.240
Mom, I'm not having sex,
all right?

28:24.320 --> 28:28.240
Really... I'm not even close
to an embarrassing degree.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.040
(Patty sighs)

28:33.560 --> 28:34.640
Okay.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.320
I'm sorry, honey. I just...

28:41.080 --> 28:44.680
I just... I want you to be
prepared when the time comes.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.320
Whenever the time comes.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.120
It'll never come.
Not with Jordan.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.840
-Is that what's bothering you?
-No! Nothing's bothering me.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.280
Something's bothering you.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.080
Mom, you couldn't possibly
understand or help, so please.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.680
I don't mean to hurt
your feelings, but just please.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.000
(music playing in background)

29:10.080 --> 29:11.560
I'm here if you need me.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.840
You know that.

29:13.920 --> 29:20.600
-(music continues in background)
-(thunder rumbling)

29:46.320 --> 29:48.560
-That's good to know about.
-Yeah.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.200
My uncle choked
on a chicken bone.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.000
(Angela)
<i>That's when the change happened.</i>

29:54.760 --> 29:55.840
<i>Just like that.</i>

29:57.080 --> 30:00.720
<i>Somewhere in those few seconds,</i>
<i>I knew my life would never be the same.</i>

30:00.800 --> 30:01.840
Did he survive?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.040
Yeah.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.280
(Angela) <i>I knew then</i>
<i>that the rumor was right.</i>

30:07.240 --> 30:10.680
<i>Not in actuality, but in my</i>
<i>heart because at that moment,</i>

30:10.760 --> 30:13.840
I would've done anything,
I wanted him so much.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.240
I didn't say anything about...

30:17.320 --> 30:18.680
-you know.
-I know.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.120
-I just wanted you to know that.
-Thank you.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.200
Because I'm not like that.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.880
-I don't do that.
-No.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.680
-It's so weird, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.440
I mean, the way people talk.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.200
I mean...
people think we did it.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.280
I know.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.720
It's like we might as well have
done it anyway at this point.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.360
I mean at least...

30:46.240 --> 30:48.760
I mean, if everybody's
talking about it already...

30:49.440 --> 30:50.720
maybe we, uh...

30:52.640 --> 30:55.000
I mean, not to make a big deal
out of it or anything.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.680
-Out of what?
-Out of...

30:58.840 --> 31:00.240
Out of anything.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.480
I mean, if everybody's...

31:03.880 --> 31:05.320
already assuming it anyway...

31:06.720 --> 31:09.200
maybe... we should...

31:10.320 --> 31:11.320
just...

31:11.800 --> 31:14.160
(Angela) <i>It's amazing the things</i>
<i>you notice.</i>

31:14.920 --> 31:17.920
<i>Like the corner of his collar</i>
<i>that was coming undone.</i>

31:18.000 --> 31:21.400
<i>Like he was from a poor family</i>
<i>and couldn't afford new shirts.</i>

31:22.240 --> 31:23.760
<i>That's all I could see.</i>

31:23.840 --> 31:27.080
<i>The whole world was that</i>
<i>unraveled piece of fabric.</i>

31:27.160 --> 31:28.240
I think...

31:30.520 --> 31:31.760
I have to go.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.040
-Look, I'm sorry if I...
-No, it's okay.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.040
-No pressure or anything.
-I have to go.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.400
You could just think about it.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.600
(Angela) <i>It's such a lie that you should</i>
<i>do what's in your heart.</i>

31:42.360 --> 31:46.000
<i>If we all did what was in our hearts,</i>
<i>the world would grind to a halt.</i>

31:46.080 --> 31:48.240
(water running, stops)

31:59.680 --> 32:03.320
And they know that he knows.
I can't believe he didn't tell them.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.920
He got a perfect
score on his PSATs.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.280
You believe that.
Now it will be ruined.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.920
What does this have
to do with Angela?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.480
They would have sex.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.560
Her and Jordan
had sex at Brian's house.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.200
Oh, my God. Can you believe it.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.320
Right, In the front yard.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.840
Brian watched the entire thing
through his kitchen window.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.280
Aren't you and Angela tight?

32:21.360 --> 32:22.920
She was, like, my best friend.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.640
This whole thing has been
hard for me to accept.

32:26.400 --> 32:31.800
But Brian wouldn't lie,
so... it's like... it's like she's this...

32:32.760 --> 32:35.120
it's like she's this completely
different person.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.880
-Like a slut?
-No. No. No, she's not.

32:40.400 --> 32:44.320
I think she's just, like,
confused or something.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.760
(bell ringing)

32:50.720 --> 32:52.360
(door closes)

33:03.320 --> 33:05.480
-So, you want me to kill her?
-No. It doesn't matter.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.360
It's Brian who should be killed.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.920
He should definitely die.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.440
He's going to rat on Rickie.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.880
What is there actually
to rat on Rickie? Do you know?

33:13.800 --> 33:16.000
Whatever he did
he did 'cause he had to.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.640
You haven't cleaned him up after some
Neanderthal beats the hell out of him.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.240
Come here for a minute, son.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.840
-Rickie Vasquez, familiar with the name?
-Excuse me?

33:36.360 --> 33:38.720
What can you tell me, son,
about Rickie Vasquez?

33:40.640 --> 33:41.720
He goes here?

33:43.040 --> 33:45.520
I don't... I mean...

33:46.920 --> 33:50.480
did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?

33:52.360 --> 33:55.760
Mr. Krakow, I'm going to tell
you about a legal term.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.880
It's called accessory
after the fact.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.600
I don't like accessories
after the fact.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.280
I don't want them in my school.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.800
You'll come to my office at three o'clock

34:03.880 --> 34:07.200
and tell me everything you know about
Rickie Vasquez

34:07.280 --> 34:10.040
and anyone else who might
be involved in this incident.

34:10.120 --> 34:13.240
If you don't,
regardless of your grade scores,

34:13.320 --> 34:15.800
you may not be going
to this school much longer.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.960
You get my clear intent?

34:19.040 --> 34:20.080
Yes, sir.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.800
Good.

34:28.440 --> 34:32.720
(computer keyboard clicking)

34:33.840 --> 34:37.800
(thunder rumbling)

34:39.800 --> 34:42.480
-What?
-I don't even want to talk to you.

34:42.560 --> 34:43.880
Then don't.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.560
-Did Rickie have the gun?
-Give me a break. God, Angela.

34:47.640 --> 34:49.640
You don't know
the whole situation.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.080
-I don't want him hurt.
-Him hurt?

34:56.080 --> 34:57.080
What about me?

34:58.760 --> 35:00.160
This is the police now.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.720
Should I get expelled protecting
someone I don't even know?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.080
Don't ask me.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.000
Nobody's interested
in the truth.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.600
Nobody is interested in truth. All they
care about is what they want to believe.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.360
If you're concerned with the
truth, Why did you lie about me?

35:12.440 --> 35:15.440
-You name don't even come up.
-Not the gun thing, to Sharon.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.360
What you said to her about
me and Jordan Catalano.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.600
-What are you talking about?
-I heard her, Brian.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.960
You told her terrible things.
False things. You lied to her.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.600
I didn't lie to her. I just...

35:38.800 --> 35:41.320
What difference does it make?
I can imagine what she did with it.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.560
But it's just...
that you lied, too,

35:48.520 --> 35:51.240
when you said you didn't know anything
about Jordan coming over that night.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.920
Because I've thought about
it for like 50 hours.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.600
You knew it, didn't you?
You used me.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.000
It's not the same.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.240
Maybe it is,
because you did what you wanted.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.760
You didn't care about what
damaged it did to anybody else.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.120
What damage did it do to you?

36:09.280 --> 36:13.160
(thunder continues rumbling)

36:16.120 --> 36:17.480
Angela?

36:19.840 --> 36:20.840
Angela.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.800
Can I talk to you for a second?

36:23.920 --> 36:27.120
-How you doing?
-You know. Life goes on.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.000
I was thinking about
what I said to you yesterday.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.800
-You know, the thing.
-Right. The thing.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.320
Look, I'm sorry about that.

36:35.400 --> 36:39.120
Afterwards I thought it through,
and I could see how you got upset...

36:39.200 --> 36:41.400
-No, I wasn't upset.
-Some girls wouldn't be,

36:41.480 --> 36:43.440
but... you're not like that,

36:43.520 --> 36:47.440
so... I just wanted to say...
I'm sorry.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.160
No. It's really okay.
I mean, it wasn't a problem.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.440
Really, I didn't think about it.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.000
I mean, I did think about it,
and I thought...

36:59.880 --> 37:02.320
maybe what you were
saying wasn't so wrong.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
-No. It was really wrong.
-Why?

37:04.480 --> 37:06.920
And I just want to let you know,
that if it'll make you feel better,

37:07.640 --> 37:12.040
I'll make it clear that I don't have
any real interest in you or anything...

37:13.200 --> 37:15.960
so they'll stop saying that.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.200
(bell ringing)

37:19.280 --> 37:22.200
You know, that I barely even know you,
which is, of course, true,

37:22.280 --> 37:26.360
and that basically, you and I
mean nothing to each other.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.880
-So that should solve the problem.
-Thanks.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.440
It's the least I can do,
you know.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.760
Right.

37:45.520 --> 37:50.360
-(serene music playing)
-(siren blaring at distance)

38:07.080 --> 38:09.160
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.280
Whatcha doing out here?

38:12.360 --> 38:13.520
It's what I always do.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.320
I can't make it through
a whole day in there.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.760
I know what you mean.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.120
Yeah. What do you need
to hide from?

38:19.840 --> 38:23.120
-Your life is perfect. I'm serious.
-(scoffs)

38:23.880 --> 38:25.600
I would give anything
to have your life.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.840
-My life is so pathetic.
-You have this great house...

38:31.560 --> 38:33.200
parents that are, like, there...

38:34.120 --> 38:35.760
and no one bothers you
at school.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.600
Rickie, I need to talk to you
about the gun.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.040
Don't.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.240
-You can't carry a gun, Rickie.
-I don't.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.680
'Cause it'd be really bad.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.880
-Tragically bad.
-Angela, I don't carry a gun.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.600
I wouldn't even know
how to shoot one.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.280
But didn't Brian see you?

38:54.200 --> 38:55.680
Isn't that what
he's going to tell them?

38:58.000 --> 39:01.120
This is really serious. People will think
you're a dangerous person.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.200
I know.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.240
That's what I want.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.880
So what did happen?

39:11.280 --> 39:13.600
My cousin brought it
in to sell it...

39:14.520 --> 39:17.280
and I got real mad at him
for bringing a gun into school.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.640
So we got into this
big argument.

39:21.680 --> 39:24.760
The next thing I knew, the thing
fell out of the box and went off.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.280
And he peed in his pants
and ran away.

39:29.760 --> 39:33.040
-He did not.
-He did. Big stain.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.680
(Rickie, Angela chuckles)

39:34.760 --> 39:36.680
And that's what happened
with the gun?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.400
That's the whole story
of the gun.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.120
And now Brian's going
to say you did it.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.280
I'm telling you, I hope he does.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.200
No. Don't be stupid.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.640
You know, it's weird.

39:59.840 --> 40:03.040
(mellow music playing)

40:03.120 --> 40:07.480
I always think of you
as... Rayanne's friend.

40:09.520 --> 40:12.880
I mean, like...
you just think of me as...

40:16.360 --> 40:20.200
as someone who's just...
you know, around.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.360
(Angela) <i>It's weird how something</i>
<i>has to happen sometimes...</i>

40:26.760 --> 40:29.320
<i>to see how you actually</i>
<i>feel about someone.</i>

40:29.400 --> 40:35.200
-(serene music playing)
-(bell ringing)

40:50.360 --> 40:53.560
Sit down, Mr. Krakow. We're just waiting
for our friends from law enforcement.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.480
Could you imagine Rickie
in a high-security prison?

41:02.560 --> 41:03.720
Who'd supply his makeup?

41:03.800 --> 41:06.120
Could it might be possibly not
make everything into a joke?

41:06.200 --> 41:08.920
Angela, there is nothing
to worry about.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.440
Harlan, this guy Tino knows...

41:11.520 --> 41:14.000
he's been arrested
with a gun twice,

41:14.080 --> 41:15.320
and nothing ever happened.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.200
It's no big deal.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.080
Know what I would really like?

41:21.240 --> 41:25.760
-To be put out of my misery.
-Are you kidding? This is fun!

41:25.840 --> 41:26.960
Fun?

41:27.040 --> 41:30.320
Everyone running around
all upset, rumor's flying.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.080
Can't you feel it
in your fingers and your toes?

41:33.160 --> 41:35.280
It's like... being alive.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.000
-Man, it's such a rush.
-You're out of your mind.

41:39.960 --> 41:40.760
Last year,

41:40.840 --> 41:43.800
that rumor about me and Mark Hammer in
the orchestra pit during the talent show?

41:44.520 --> 41:48.840
In that case, it was true. But...
man, all that conversation.

41:49.320 --> 41:53.120
People writing notes, and they...
look at you different,

41:53.200 --> 41:55.760
trying to figure out
who you really are.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.360
Like you're famous.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.720
Admit it.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.560
It's really great.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.080
I don't know
what you're talking about.

42:06.520 --> 42:12.040
(indistinct conversations)

42:18.080 --> 42:19.560
Come in, gentlemen.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.000
So, Mr. Krakow.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.920
I've thought a lot about
what you said,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.400
and I've decided the main thing
is to protect the school.

42:38.680 --> 42:39.920
That's good, Brian.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.520
I went to the bathroom...

42:43.640 --> 42:46.400
I heard a scuffle, then a shot.
I came out.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.600
I saw two pairs of legs
running in opposite directions.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.280
Who those people
were I can't say.

42:53.960 --> 42:59.520
And if you... or these men...
or anybody else threatens me anymore

42:59.600 --> 43:00.960
-or pressures me anymore...
-Brian...

43:01.040 --> 43:02.960
I will insist on having
a lawyer,

43:03.040 --> 43:06.480
and I will sue you for harassment
and anything else I can.

43:06.560 --> 43:10.520
If you try to expel me to solve
your public relations problems,

43:10.600 --> 43:12.680
I will reveal to anyone who will listen,

43:12.760 --> 43:14.840
just who is destroying
the spirit of this school.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.200
Hey.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.960
So they still haven't found
out who had the gun.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.240
Mom, it's okay. Let it go.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.280
The school hasn't
self-destructed yet.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.360
It's just so hard not being
able to protect you.

43:42.440 --> 43:43.960
Yeah, but you can't.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.120
Mike, wait up.

43:54.200 --> 44:00.040
(upbeat music playing)

44:19.640 --> 44:21.000
Hey, what's up?

44:22.600 --> 44:24.080
I'm gonna get a little knife.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.640
A girl's got to protect herself.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.240
I need heavy artillery,
unlike some people I know.

44:45.280 --> 44:50.800
(serene music playing)

45:25.800 --> 45:30.760
(theme music playing)
