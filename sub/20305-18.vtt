WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:03.753
Item 12. Stop 'N' Cop blocks.

00:03.837 --> 00:07.590
An operation against these
drug supermarkets begins today.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.634
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:09.718 --> 00:11.469
Where are you going, dirt bag?

00:12.095 --> 00:12.929
(grunts)

00:14.973 --> 00:17.934
It's a PR stunt that puts my people
at risk and erodes morale.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.896
The chief wants to help Ozzie
make good on a campaign promise.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.314
Well, what would you do, Captain?

00:23.398 --> 00:27.861
Maybe I'd pay less attention
to transient political concerns.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.780
"Politicians moving on
to other trendy issues."

00:30.864 --> 00:32.282
-That's out of context.
-Bull.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.242
You have hurt me, Frank,

00:34.576 --> 00:36.202
and you're going to pay for it.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.371
(gunshots)

00:40.707 --> 00:41.624
(baby crying)

00:47.714 --> 00:50.008
I'm sorry I can't make
a positive identification.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.885
FRANK: We're not looking
for legal certainty here, Joyce.

00:51.968 --> 00:55.096
I understand what you're looking for.
I can't be sure it's he.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.931
The captain needs to make this case.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.934
The captain can't do that
without your testimony.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.227
Frank, I know what my duty is.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.772
How do you think it makes me feel
knowing that I can't do it?

01:05.857 --> 01:07.275
(chattering)

01:07.358 --> 01:08.777
LUCY: <i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

01:08.860 --> 01:11.029
Settle down, guys. Very funny.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.781
(chattering)

01:12.864 --> 01:15.158
Item 12. Stop 'N' Cop.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.367
Flop.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.536
(laughter)

01:19.245 --> 01:20.288
LUCY: Yeah, all right.

01:21.331 --> 01:25.835
Flop or no flop,
and Captain Furillo's reservations aside,

01:25.919 --> 01:29.839
our operation against flagrant
drug street trafficking

01:29.923 --> 01:32.008
continues in that vicinity.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.178
We're moving surveillance up
two blocks to 121st Street.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.347
Assignments remain.

01:37.430 --> 01:41.851
LaRue's out sick, so we'll be moving in...

01:43.061 --> 01:45.396
Harry Garibaldi from Midtown!

01:45.480 --> 01:48.274
(cheers, applause)

01:48.358 --> 01:50.068
MAN: Yay, Harry!

01:50.151 --> 01:52.320
That's Harry Harry-balFdy.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.614
Harry Harry-baldy? That's right, slim.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.158
(people oohing)

01:57.242 --> 02:00.078
Item 13. Mullins brothers.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.080
As of this morning,

02:02.789 --> 02:07.168
we've got zero usable evidence
on either brother in either homicide.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.839
Now, William is due to walk out
of Michigan Avenue this morning.

02:11.589 --> 02:14.425
And Timothy will probably be released
after arraignment this afternoon.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.719
RENKO: Timothy's gonna crawl out
this afternoon.

02:16.803 --> 02:17.971
LUCY: Check the duty board,

02:18.346 --> 02:22.725
and, guys, Captain Furillo would be
real grateful for a break on this one.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.687
Hey, Luce, is it right that Ms. Davenport
wouldn't finger Timothy?

02:25.770 --> 02:28.106
She said she couldn't.
She said she was unable to.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.065
JOE: Yeah.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.986
Item 14 is part of the city's lawsuit

02:33.069 --> 02:36.906
to prove that it was undercounted
in the last census,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.367
particularly in, and I quote,

02:39.450 --> 02:42.370
"Areas of coincidental plant
and stock disrepairment

02:42.453 --> 02:44.414
and high minority inhabitation."

02:44.497 --> 02:46.916
(chattering)

02:47.000 --> 02:49.043
They're gonna have a team of census takers

02:49.127 --> 02:51.588
that are gonna be canvassing
the Van Buren corridor.

02:51.671 --> 02:55.341
Due to the high crime rate,
they're going to need police escort,

02:55.425 --> 02:56.509
and that's Renko and Hill.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.387
-We are thrilled beyond words.
-(laughter)

03:00.346 --> 03:01.764
Item 15.

03:02.599 --> 03:06.769
Final day for equestrian application
to Lieutenant Howard Hunter.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.479
And in other sport news,

03:09.480 --> 03:11.399
bowling league opens tonight.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.859
(cheering)

03:12.942 --> 03:15.403
What's the biggest problem
facing Poland today?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.363
-MAN: What?
-The 7-10 split.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.282
(laughter, groans)

03:19.365 --> 03:21.409
Hey, where does a Polish groom
sit at his wedding?

03:21.492 --> 03:23.411
-MAN: Where?
-On the reset button.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.372
(laughter)

03:26.456 --> 03:28.374
LUCY: Okay, okay, okay.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.419
It's 8:00, tonight. Harrison Lanes.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.963
That's on the south corner
of the Harrison Square.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.424
Be there, huh? Okay, let's roll.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.676
Hey, hey.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.137
And let's be careful out there.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.352
CLARA: No, I don't find it
a little bit funny. I just love it.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.063
People got zero idea
the contribution that Poland makes

03:50.146 --> 03:53.399
to culture, religion, military, economic.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.194
I got to go to the bathroom,
but believe me, this isn't finished.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.154
RENKO: Mr. Tasco, are you ready?

03:58.238 --> 04:02.408
Great day to count.
Cold. People stay indoors.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.202
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Tasco. Lieutenant?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.664
Uh, sir, did you get our application
for the equestrian?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.123
Top of the list, Andrew,

04:09.207 --> 04:11.459
and I'm looking forward to you men
riding on my flanks.

04:11.542 --> 04:12.752
LEO: Renko! Phone!

04:13.127 --> 04:13.962
Great.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.797
-Bobby?
-RENKO: Yeah?

04:16.005 --> 04:18.383
-You ever ride before?
-Uh, no, Lieutenant.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.968
Ah, not to worry. You're athletic.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.179
Um, Lieutenant, is it true
that horses can't see anything

04:23.263 --> 04:24.472
directly in front of them?

04:25.515 --> 04:26.849
Daryl Ann, you're gonna
have to speak up, darling.

04:26.933 --> 04:27.976
I can hardly hear you.

04:31.062 --> 04:31.896
Say what?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.485
Oh, sweetie baby, are you sure?

04:38.569 --> 04:40.113
Daryl Ann, please don't cry like that.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.825
I don't know, Daryl Ann.
I'm gonna have to talk to you about it.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.660
I-I'll just have to see you later.

04:47.203 --> 04:50.164
Daryl Ann, check, okay?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.666
I don't know where to check.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.752
I just-just check however it is
that you would be checking.

04:56.004 --> 04:56.838
Okay.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.090
Goodbye.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.050
Lord, oh, Lordy.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.095
So, Mr. Tasco, are you read--

05:05.513 --> 05:06.973
Bobby Hill, my Daryl Ann's pregnant.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.225
You're kidding. A little cowboy?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.477
Great! I'm gonna be an uncle!

05:12.061 --> 05:12.895
Yeah.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.816
I want you to know
if I ain't back here in 20 minutes,

05:16.899 --> 05:18.526
I want you to come after me
with a plumber's helper,

05:18.609 --> 05:20.611
'cause I just my flush my very existence.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.865
Leo, did Frank leave
a suitcase here for me?

05:24.365 --> 05:26.117
Frank Jr.'s, I presume?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.035
Yes, thank you.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.953
I think he'd lose his head
if it wasn't screwed on.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.582
-Oh, it's you and me, mama.
-Hey, hey, hey, excuse me.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.169
-Let's jiggle. Let's go.
-I said, "Excuse me!"

05:36.252 --> 05:37.378
Listen, mister!

05:37.462 --> 05:39.255
-Wah! Wah!
-(laughing)

05:39.714 --> 05:41.174
-Ah!
-(grunting)

05:51.726 --> 05:53.853
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:54.312 --> 05:55.980
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:56.064 --> 05:59.859
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:59.942 --> 06:01.778
(sirens wailing)

06:07.158 --> 06:10.953
(theme music playing)

07:48.342 --> 07:50.845
-Robert Pirado. A stabbing?
-Interrogation.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.365
RAY: Leo, I am very disappointed.
Do you believe her?

08:11.449 --> 08:13.326
The woman got scared, period.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.496
What do you think, Henry?

08:16.579 --> 08:17.997
-About what?
-(door closes)

08:18.080 --> 08:18.998
Joyce Davenport.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.418
Maybe she really couldn't see his face.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.586
Do you believe that?

08:25.254 --> 08:26.088
No.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.341
Yeah? Well, she's been busting our chops

08:28.424 --> 08:31.302
for longer than I can remember
about legal duties.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.179
And now she has one. Where is she?

08:34.263 --> 08:35.640
You know the sad part about it?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.267
That old Black guy got croaked,
the witness...

08:38.976 --> 08:40.269
he was a good guy.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.107
All I can say is I am very disappointed.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.902
(toilet flushes)

08:53.282 --> 08:54.700
(clears throat)

08:54.784 --> 08:56.911
Don't be too hard on them, Frank.
It's just their opinion.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.828
And your opinion?

08:58.996 --> 09:00.248
-Yeah.
-Damn it, Henry.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.791
It's not that cut and dried.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.376
I know it isn't.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.629
Timothy Mullins killed to save William.
Why wouldn't William kill to free Timothy?

09:06.712 --> 09:07.880
I understand that.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.093
Then you understand
why I can't stand up for her.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.261
Maybe somebody should.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.096
Frank...

09:15.888 --> 09:17.473
I can only call them as I see them.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.309
Ready for your press conference?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.811
Don't worry about my press conference.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.897
You worry about getting something
on Timothy Mullins that will make.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.023
Will do.

09:28.859 --> 09:32.113
Uh, Frank, Henry.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.282
Howard.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.034
Uh, friends, please, a moment.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.871
Ticklish? Yes, I'd say so.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.498
But believe me,

09:44.208 --> 09:46.377
my first priority here is camaraderie.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.753
What are you getting at, Howard?

09:50.548 --> 09:52.091
I've asked Fay to lunch.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.803
Now, just say the word, and I'll pull out.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.979
So, then Carlos say,
"Where's my money? I hit the number."

10:05.813 --> 10:08.858
And I say,
"Nice. Don't do this, Carlos, man.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.151
You didn't have no number."

10:10.943 --> 10:12.737
And then he started hitting you
with the golf club?

10:13.362 --> 10:17.283
Yeah, he beat me hard. Here... and here.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.534
Then you pulled the knife?

10:18.868 --> 10:21.412
There is a witness
that can prove it was self-defense.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.123
Police report doesn't mention a witness.

10:24.540 --> 10:28.836
I saw him.
Krebs' Carpet, we was right outside.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.880
Old Morris, man, he saw us.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.132
He went back inside or something.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.676
Talk to him, man. He'll tell you.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.512
Our best chance is if the police would.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.682
Please. I'm not a guilty man.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.895
This Carlos, he's conquistador.
He's got the big record.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.731
I got my wife and my kid.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.485
I got no reason to cut him up
unless he come after me.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.905
I believe you, Mr. Pirado.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.615
We'll try.

11:02.036 --> 11:02.995
Sorry I'm late.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.705
JOYCE: We've just finished.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.671
I want you to know I completely understand
why you wouldn't ID that animal.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.590
I hardly slept last night.
I feel real bad for you.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.260
-Thanks.
-I mean, I saw the gun and ducked.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.805
So, don't let them bully you
into anything.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.265
-They can make the case some other way.
-I don't know.

11:24.058 --> 11:24.892
Henry...

11:27.853 --> 11:28.813
How you doing, Joyce?

11:30.815 --> 11:31.899
Could I ask a favor?

11:32.733 --> 11:35.611
On my stabbing client, Pirado,
I think it's self-defense.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.988
There's a witness
who might be able to substantiate.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.282
-Would you like us to bring him in?
-If you would.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.621
Nothing yet on Timothy Mullins.
No other witness, no weapons.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.174
Did you ever hear of Chopin?
I mean, did you ever hear of Pulaski?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.634
-The movie director?
-(groaning)

11:59.009 --> 12:01.679
Pulaski happened to be
a very famous Polish general

12:01.762 --> 12:03.431
who practically gave
the American Revolution

12:03.514 --> 12:04.557
to George Washington.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.684
They named a skyway
in New Jersey after him.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.937
Clara, I'm sure there are
a lot of famous Polish people, okay?

12:10.020 --> 12:10.980
-Yeah?
-But that doesn't mean

12:11.063 --> 12:11.897
a joke can't be funny.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.983
Yeah, but what is so funny
about a reset button?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.943
I don't even know what a reset button is.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.904
It's in a bowling alley.
You press it to reset the pins.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.157
Yeah, but you bowl. I don't bowl.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.825
What does that tell you?

12:23.117 --> 12:26.036
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Any unit in vicinity of 3239 Jefferson,</i>

12:26.120 --> 12:28.122
<i>apartment 308, woman dead in wall.</i>

12:29.290 --> 12:31.417
Unit 2203 in vicinity.
What does that mean?

12:31.709 --> 12:35.045
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Not sure, 2203.</i>
<i>Just says woman may be dead in the walls.</i>

12:35.129 --> 12:36.172
(siren wailing)

12:36.255 --> 12:38.549
I got a busted furnace,
the phone's ringing off the hook,

12:38.632 --> 12:41.886
now I got some nut case
who hears voices in the wall.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.682
Anybody in here?

12:46.932 --> 12:48.851
WOMAN (muffled): I'm in here, in the wall!

12:48.934 --> 12:50.019
-Let me out!
-It's a Murphy bed.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.314
WOMAN: Oh, that slime tried to kill me!

12:53.397 --> 12:54.565
JOE: Okay. Just relax.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.860
WOMAN: Oh, that-- Get me out of here!

12:57.943 --> 13:00.029
All right. Okay.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.989
Oh, it's the police. Oh, thank heaven.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.242
-Oh, thank-- Oh, it's the--
-Okay.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.661
-There you go.
-Oh, thank you.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.079
Okay. You all right?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.207
My husband tried to murder me.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.458
He rolled the bed up!

13:12.541 --> 13:15.544
He didn't care if I expired or suffocated!

13:15.628 --> 13:16.796
All right, all right.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.549
-Hey, hey, you. Break it, man. Come here.
-WOMAN: Oh, that maggot!

13:21.175 --> 13:22.635
-Okay.
-That killing swine!

13:22.718 --> 13:24.011
You're Jack the Ripper!

13:24.094 --> 13:26.222
-What's this all about?
-CLARA: Suppose you tell us.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.516
It's a-- It's a misunderstanding.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.809
You tried to kill me!

13:29.892 --> 13:32.269
I mistakenly rolled her up in the bed.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.854
Since eight o'clock this morning?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.732
Look, can we agree that
there's just been no harm done?

13:36.816 --> 13:37.858
No harm?

13:37.942 --> 13:42.029
Oh, a man tries to punch his wife's clock
in his viciousness and guilt

13:42.112 --> 13:44.240
when he fails his sexual duty!

13:44.323 --> 13:46.325
I want to file charges!

13:46.408 --> 13:48.285
Ma'am, that's a very complicated process.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.579
Oh, he rolled me up like some dead sheep.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.040
I want that man arrested!

13:53.874 --> 13:56.001
You got it, ma'am. You're busted, sucker.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.127
Come on. Turn around.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.757
All right, we got attempted murder,
false imprisonment,

14:01.841 --> 14:03.509
abuse of a domestic facility.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.804
That ought to get you, uh, about 19 years.
Let's go.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.347
Nineteen years?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.349
-Remy, one of us could be dead!
-Yeah.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.603
-Really? 19 years?
-These are very serious charges.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.730
Yeah, well, maybe I could
just bargain it down

14:16.814 --> 14:18.774
to just a couple of nasty weeks.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.318
-Uh-uh.
-Not a chance. Let's go, creep.

14:21.402 --> 14:25.281
Wait a minute. No... (muttering)
Honey, no.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.074
-Oh, I didn't mean it.
-WOMAN (on radio): <i>All units.</i>

14:27.157 --> 14:29.159
-No, don't take him.
<i>-Vicinity operations Stop 'N' Cop,</i>

14:29.243 --> 14:31.996
<i>We got an armed perp.</i>
<i>Reports shots fired,</i>

14:32.079 --> 14:34.164
<i>northbound on 122nd from Dekker.</i>

14:34.790 --> 14:36.959
CLARA: We're responding.
2203, We're on our way.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.294
(sobbing)

14:38.377 --> 14:40.588
And don't roll her up
in the bed no more, okay?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.464
(crying)

14:42.548 --> 14:45.634
(sirens wailing)

14:48.512 --> 14:49.555
Watch out!

15:00.149 --> 15:02.026
CLARA: 2203, we got him in the alley!

15:04.403 --> 15:05.696
Look out!

15:10.951 --> 15:12.077
Freeze!

15:22.129 --> 15:24.798
Oh, boy. I had to do that.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.634
I know I had to do it.

15:37.436 --> 15:43.734
-All right, what do we got here?
-2211 Van Ness. Eight stories, 56 units...

15:43.817 --> 15:48.405
I swear, Bobby, we were so careful.
We took every conceivable precaution.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.741
"Conceivable" is right.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.203
Richie, you take five and four.
I'll meet you on three.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.120
Right.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.707
-Okay.
-MAN: Good morning.

15:59.583 --> 16:04.922
What with your wave of immigrants,
both illegal and otherwise,

16:05.422 --> 16:09.134
your overpopulation of the future
is becoming a thing of the present.

16:09.426 --> 16:13.806
All over the world,
wherever you got voodoo birth control,

16:14.181 --> 16:15.766
you got your classic ingredients

16:15.849 --> 16:18.519
for the social domination
of the unwed mother,

16:19.103 --> 16:21.647
dropping babies like dandelion seeds.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.941
Am I moving too fast for you, son?

16:25.776 --> 16:28.529
Anyway, nobody wants to say
anything to a coat and tie.

16:28.612 --> 16:33.200
They think you're the welfare,
immigration, utilities, cops...

16:33.283 --> 16:36.078
(chuckling) And people complain about
getting an honest count.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.998
Might as well be looking
for an honest man.

16:39.623 --> 16:43.002
(speaking in Spanish)

16:44.294 --> 16:46.505
-Yes?
-Ma'am, I'm from the Census Bureau,

16:46.588 --> 16:49.967
and I wanted to ask you about the number
of people living in the apartment here.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.510
You're from the police.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.972
Oh, no, ma'am. The Census Bureau.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.725
How many people are living
in the apartment, please?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.144
Uh, just me. Only me.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.480
Ma'am, I hear children's voices in there.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.692
Oh, is neighbor's kids.
I babysit, you know.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.485
(man speaking in Spanish)

17:08.569 --> 17:09.737
(speaking in Spanish)

17:10.320 --> 17:13.240
(clears throat) Just one person. Only one.

17:14.408 --> 17:15.242
Bye.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.038
Well, split the difference, say four.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.707
Mr. Tasco, I guess despite
everybody's best efforts,

17:21.790 --> 17:24.626
sometimes, birth control
just don't work out, does it?

17:24.710 --> 17:27.713
(chuckling) You're asking the wrong man
that question, my friend.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.132
I've got six kids.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.718
Sure gives someone
food for thought there, don't it?

17:32.801 --> 17:35.763
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Unit 2202, respond, unit 2202.</i>

17:36.138 --> 17:37.181
This is 2202.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.767
<i>Request immediate backup</i>
<i>on Stop 'N' Cop block.</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:41.643
<i>Proceed to 116th and Dekker.</i>

17:41.727 --> 17:43.062
Mr. Tasco,
I'm gonna have to leave you now.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.688
-2202 in response.
-Oh, that's fine.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.690
I'd just as soon work on my own, anyway.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.859
If you call in your location.
We'll try to get back to you later, okay?

17:48.942 --> 17:50.194
Sure, sure. No hurry.

17:54.406 --> 17:58.035
Frank, please, just tell me
your statement's gonna do the job.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.287
Hard for me to say, Chief.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.164
Come on, you know the drill.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.210
Dedicated public servant,
heat of the moment, contrition, humility.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.545
I'm just not used
to the public-forum end of it.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.048
You spit on his campaign promise, Frank.

18:11.131 --> 18:14.009
What do you expect him to do?
Hand you the key to the city?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.636
The whole thing's so out of proportion.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.305
It was your mistake, my friend.
Nobody else's.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.057
Ozzie's furious, and rightly so.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.600
I can't protect you.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.770
I didn't get out of my sitz bath
against doctor's orders

18:24.853 --> 18:26.688
to have my heinie kicked
all over city hall.

18:27.147 --> 18:31.985
So, how about we go downstairs,
and you take your lumps?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.489
(chattering)

18:35.572 --> 18:36.573
WOMAN: Okay, here they come.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.785
(camera shutters clicking)

18:39.868 --> 18:41.036
MAN: Here they come.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.505
I have a statement,

18:51.588 --> 18:53.966
and then there will be a short
question-and-answer period.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.804
During an interview yesterday,
I made remarks regarding a drug operation

18:58.887 --> 19:00.472
being conducted by this department.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.725
At that time,
I was speaking outside my role

19:03.809 --> 19:05.978
as precinct captain and police officer,

19:06.979 --> 19:10.899
and I should have realized that my words
were derogatory and ill-considered.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.653
I would like to apologize
to those who have worked so hard

19:14.736 --> 19:17.781
in the conception
and execution of this operation.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.162
-Questions?
-(reporters clamoring)

19:23.245 --> 19:25.956
Are you now retracting
what you said yesterday

19:26.039 --> 19:27.708
about Stop 'N' Cop being a sham?

19:27.791 --> 19:28.625
I never used that word.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.753
Do you not believe Stop 'N' Cop
is gonna take hard drugs off city streets?

19:31.837 --> 19:35.924
We can't properly access the success
or failure of an operation

19:36.008 --> 19:37.509
until all the paperwork is in.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.552
If you just give it a chance.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.388
Are you saying the operation
is not politically motivated?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.473
It's a police officer's duty

19:44.141 --> 19:47.227
to support and carry out
the policies of its department,

19:47.769 --> 19:48.604
to do a good day's work.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.147
WOMAN: What about the officer
who was stabbed?

19:50.230 --> 19:51.940
Was that part of a good day's work?

19:52.399 --> 19:54.943
Injuries are never acceptable,
but sometimes they happen in this work.

19:55.027 --> 19:59.156
We've been told one of your officers,
a Patrolwoman Pilsky,

19:59.364 --> 20:02.492
uh, shot and killed an addict
in a Stop 'N' Cop related action

20:02.576 --> 20:03.535
less than an hour ago.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.871
-I am aware of it.
-Have you spoken to the officer?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.873
-FRANK: Not as yet.
-Will you be able to tell the officers

20:07.956 --> 20:08.916
their actions were justified?

20:08.999 --> 20:10.876
Not without knowing the circumstances.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.378
So it's possible the action
was not justified?

20:13.462 --> 20:17.007
Look, at a time like this
out on those streets, anything's possible.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.008
-What I'm saying--
-MAN: Captain.

20:18.091 --> 20:21.261
This doesn't sound like a blanket
endorsement of Stop 'N' Cop, Captain.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.763
An endorsement?

20:23.764 --> 20:26.516
Look, the minute we start endorsing
the wounding of officers

20:26.600 --> 20:29.478
and the death of citizens
under any circumstances,

20:30.062 --> 20:31.605
well, we'd just better cancel

20:31.688 --> 20:34.024
the fundamental assumptions
we all live under and... (stutters)

20:34.107 --> 20:35.108
and start all over.

20:35.776 --> 20:39.863
-That's all I have.
-(reporters shouting)

20:43.575 --> 20:44.409
HENRY: Joyce...

20:45.619 --> 20:48.080
Found that witness in the gang assault,
the storekeeper.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.123
-Is he in?
-He's in lineup.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.709
-Be a few minutes yet.
-Thank you, Henry.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.379
Just so you know,
William Mullins was released

20:55.462 --> 20:57.506
from Michigan Avenue
about an hour and a half ago.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.301
Lieutenant, a Linda Talbot to see you.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.012
-Talbot?
-Lionel Talbot's daughter.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.348
-The guy who got shot yesterday.
-(sighs)

21:06.431 --> 21:07.266
Okay.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.396
Miss Talbot, I'm Lieutenant Goldblume.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.607
Lieutenant, is it true
that you have a suspect

21:15.691 --> 21:17.234
of my father's murder in custody?

21:18.068 --> 21:21.488
Yes, but at the moment,
I'm afraid we don't have enough evidence--

21:21.571 --> 21:23.115
And that would be Timothy Mullins?

21:24.866 --> 21:26.743
-Yeah.
-Brother of the man, William,

21:26.827 --> 21:30.289
-that my father was gonna testify against?
-That's correct.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.083
And there were three people
who heard the shots that killed my father,

21:33.166 --> 21:35.627
two of them right outside of his store,
is that right?

21:35.711 --> 21:37.671
-HENRY: Unfortunately--
-So, my father tries to do

21:37.754 --> 21:40.007
what any good citizen is expected to do,

21:40.090 --> 21:42.759
and when it costs him his life,
no one will do the same for him?

21:43.510 --> 21:45.887
-Miss Talbot--
-That's what makes America great.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.806
Standing up for your neighbor.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.435
I want the names
of these people, Lieutenant.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.603
I want to speak to them.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.272
I want to look them in the eye!

22:00.402 --> 22:01.486
JOYCE: Frank, how'd it go?

22:03.196 --> 22:04.031
It went.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.621
Will Ozzie take his finger
off the trigger?

22:11.705 --> 22:12.706
I don't know.

22:13.915 --> 22:17.794
And I'm making a concerted effort
not to dwell on it at the moment.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.546
Excuse me, Frank, Ms. Davenport.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.342
Henry wanted you to know the witness
on your assault case is in lineup.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.552
All right if I sit in?

22:26.845 --> 22:27.679
Frank?

22:28.263 --> 22:29.348
Sure. Fine.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.395
Anything on Timothy Mullins?

22:35.771 --> 22:37.731
Search of the area
did not give us a weapon.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.941
No other witnesses have come forward.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.279
MAN: I didn't see nothing.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.656
I was in the back of my shop
the whole time.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.867
Robert Pirado says
you were outside the shop

22:48.950 --> 22:51.411
-when the assault occurred.
-Inside. I was inside.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.830
I mean, I heard it,
but I didn't see anything.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.374
And I didn't hear that much.

22:55.749 --> 22:59.127
Mr. Krebs, Robert Pirado
is claiming self-defense here.

22:59.419 --> 23:02.089
If that's true, and he's found guilty,
an innocent man could go to prison.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.925
There ain't no innocent people
in that neighborhood.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.426
HENRY: You should know
we could have you subpoenaed.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.262
So, go ahead.
I mean, it's my word against his.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.848
There wasn't anybody else there,
so who's to say?

23:11.932 --> 23:14.976
You afraid of testifying against
gang members, Mr. Krebs?

23:16.436 --> 23:18.522
What kind of a stupid question is that?

23:18.605 --> 23:20.565
-We can give you protection.
-Protection?

23:21.566 --> 23:22.484
Oh, sure.

23:24.111 --> 23:27.280
All right, first,
let's start with four radial tires,

23:27.364 --> 23:30.200
a live cat, and a new stomach for my wife.

23:31.326 --> 23:35.914
My wife was a witness against a gang kid
you had up here about five years ago.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.251
She's out walking,
she sees this punk shoot a guy.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.377
Broad daylight.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.131
We start getting phone calls
in the middle of the night.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.633
I mean, things that would
make you cough your lunch.

23:47.175 --> 23:50.679
So I call the cops,
who, incidentally, promise protection,

23:51.847 --> 23:55.642
then when the tires are slashed on my car,
you people come around, and you say,

23:55.725 --> 23:57.769
(clicking tongue) "That's too bad."

23:59.312 --> 24:01.398
The next day, my wife finds her cat

24:01.815 --> 24:04.067
hanging from the tree
in the front of the house.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.444
Gutted.

24:08.196 --> 24:12.117
She's been in and out
of doctor's offices for five years.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.369
She can't even eat!

24:16.246 --> 24:18.331
So-so, go ahead. Go ahead.

24:18.415 --> 24:21.501
Talk to me some more about protection,
Lieutenant. Come on.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.671
-WAITER: There you are.
-HUNTER: Fay...

24:25.380 --> 24:27.966
have I ever told you
how much I admire your spirit?

24:28.049 --> 24:29.926
-My spirit?
-Yes.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.595
Yes, this karate thing, for one.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.182
I mean, it stands to reason
that the Eastern mind-body disciplines

24:35.265 --> 24:38.935
would be well-suited to a woman
of your deeply sensual nature.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.271
-I beg your pardon?
-Fay...

24:42.147 --> 24:44.691
since I've been in therapy
these last months,

24:44.774 --> 24:47.861
I have come to the realization
that I no longer want to be an isolate.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.864
I am ready to share my life with someone.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.991
And I have two tickets

24:53.074 --> 24:56.119
to the Philharmonic's upcoming
rendition of Mahler's Forth,

24:56.203 --> 24:57.829
and I would be honored if you'd join me.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.958
Howard, are you asking me out on a date?

25:05.045 --> 25:07.088
In a manner of speaking, yes.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.798
-Would you?
-No.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.011
-No?
-No.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.306
May I ask why?

25:16.723 --> 25:18.767
Oh, yeah. It's nothing personal.

25:20.060 --> 25:23.188
It's just that, well,
I'm up to here with dating cops,

25:23.271 --> 25:25.232
and I want to see how
the rest of the world lives.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.485
Well, that's probably very prudent.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.153
I'm glad you understand.

25:31.988 --> 25:35.075
If the classics are not up to your taste,
we could go see a play.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.244
-Howard.
-Or a movie, or just to dinner.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.914
Howard, you're a very good
and generous person

25:41.248 --> 25:42.582
and a wonderful friend.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.420
But I don't care if you get
two tickets to the Inaugural Ball.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.673
Nothing's gonna change my mind about this.

25:54.761 --> 25:59.683
(pager beeping)

26:00.350 --> 26:01.935
(sirens wailing)

26:02.018 --> 26:05.230
MAN (on megaphone): All right, you people,
get back behind the police line.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.284
<i>Get back behind the barricade.</i>

26:21.162 --> 26:23.623
Second story, second window to the right.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.293
His name's Gerald Hutchcraft.
Discharged mental patient.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.003
The power company shut off his lights.

26:28.086 --> 26:28.962
Who's he got?

26:29.045 --> 26:31.381
Uh, one of the census takers, a Mr. Tasco.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.133
-Monty Tasco?
-Get me that line back.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.884
-I thought you guys were escorting him.
-We were called off.

26:34.968 --> 26:35.802
Oh, God!

26:36.845 --> 26:40.432
Mr. Hutchcraft,
this is Lieutenant Goldblume again.

26:41.558 --> 26:44.811
Mr. Hutchcraft, listen to me.
Your hostage is a census taker.

26:44.894 --> 26:45.812
He just counts people.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.939
He's got nothing to do
with the power company.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.984
Yes. Yes.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.527
We are sending somebody,

26:52.611 --> 26:55.322
a real power-company guy
who knows how to turn your lights on.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.282
Call gas and electric again.
Tell them to move it.

26:58.575 --> 27:02.203
Please, Mr. Hutchcraft, if you shoot him,

27:02.746 --> 27:05.665
then the real power-company guy
won't be able to help you anymore.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.418
Mr. Hutchcraft?

27:11.296 --> 27:13.965
Blue Fox, this is Fox Leader.
Can you get us a visual fix?

27:14.507 --> 27:15.967
MAN (on radio):
<i>Negative. Not enough light.</i>

27:16.051 --> 27:17.552
<i>I think the hostage is on the floor.</i>

27:17.636 --> 27:19.596
-He's giving me the willies.
-Yeah, fear of the dark.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.432
It's the oldest one in the book,
basic as breathing in.

27:22.515 --> 27:23.350
Frank?

27:25.810 --> 27:28.104
-Why did you leave them alone?
-They pulled us off, Captain.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.606
We were needed on backup on Stop 'N' Cop.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.399
-Who gave the order?
-I don't know.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.027
I want your full reports on my desk
when this is over, you got it?

27:34.110 --> 27:36.029
-Yeah.
-What in the hell's going on, Henry?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.698
Simplest operation,
and we can't protect anybody.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.909
-Frank--
-Just get him out of there! Just do it!

27:50.752 --> 27:51.878
Some deterrence.

27:52.587 --> 27:56.508
We set up on 119th, chase him to 121st,

27:56.591 --> 28:00.136
then we move to 121st, they go back
to 119th Street. That's great.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.430
I was reading
this study they did, Federal.

28:03.515 --> 28:07.394
Out of 800 observation busts,
500 copped at arraignment,

28:07.477 --> 28:08.978
right, they did 15 days.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.814
Hundred-fifty got kicked,

28:10.897 --> 28:13.358
seventy-five were blown
at the search-and-seizure hearing,

28:13.775 --> 28:15.777
and 25 squealed and did easy time,

28:15.860 --> 28:19.155
so that left 50 that were gonna be
off the street for any substantial time.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.449
-NATE: Man.
-Plus, every man that walks

28:21.533 --> 28:23.743
costs the city 1,700 bucks.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.204
Tell you, the city wants
to move that my way per unit,

28:26.287 --> 28:29.040
I'll get some junkies
off the street in a hot second.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.208
MICK (chuckles): Yeah, well...

28:34.003 --> 28:35.672
Statistics are a big help.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.340
Yeah, well, the truth
ain't pretty, either.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.093
If we're gonna be out here,
we ought to be doing it, making busts.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.303
You sound like the captain
on TV yesterday.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.055
Except I'm better-looking on camera.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.932
(Neal laughs)

28:46.015 --> 28:47.392
When's J.D. gonna be back?

28:48.309 --> 28:52.105
Blood test was trouble, Mick.
Mono for sure, maybe hepatitis.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.232
MICK: J.D. was the best bowler we had.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.901
Hey, Harry, you bowl, man?

28:57.235 --> 28:58.987
Oh, I'd love to, but I got Torts tonight.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.656
-Law school?
-Yeah, second year.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.534
Hey, no kidding?
Must be a heavy load, man.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.327
Yeah, well, you can take
a three-fifths load.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.954
You know, you'd be done in four years.

29:08.246 --> 29:09.456
All right.

29:10.623 --> 29:14.127
You know, Mike, with the lens that long,
you ought to open up a couple F-stops.

29:15.879 --> 29:16.713
It's a hobby.

29:17.297 --> 29:20.258
Fine, Harry.
Here, F-stop yourself to death.

29:20.341 --> 29:21.509
I'm going to the can.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.105
Right here you shoot up,
right where we got a stakeout?

29:35.023 --> 29:36.691
What are you, crazy? I'm a cop!

29:46.993 --> 29:49.704
Man, this is dumb! I ain't done nothing!

29:49.788 --> 29:51.331
You're under arrest!

29:56.503 --> 29:57.378
How you doing?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.088
(sighs) I'm okay, I guess.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.133
Um, they're gonna put me
on desk duty a week.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.760
IAD says that's standard policy.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.386
LUCY: Joe? Joe, come here.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.891
I need people on perimeter.
The hostage scene, 2200 Van Ness.

30:09.974 --> 30:10.809
Got it.

30:13.728 --> 30:16.940
Listen, just try not to think about it
so much, because it doesn't help.

30:17.732 --> 30:18.566
Okay.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.945
-Clara.
-Captain.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.030
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.532
-IAD finished?
-Mm-hmm.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.492
Uh, they went pretty easy on me, I think.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.744
If there's anything I can do,
let me know, will you?

30:29.828 --> 30:30.829
Thanks.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.249
Ray...

30:35.959 --> 30:38.461
Hill and Renko were pulled from
assigned duty on Stop 'N' Cop.

30:38.545 --> 30:39.462
Who issued the order?

30:39.546 --> 30:41.756
Deputy Chief Briscoe.
He took four officers.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.050
-And you didn't put up a fight?
-Of course I did.

30:44.425 --> 30:45.969
But you were at your press conference,

30:46.052 --> 30:48.388
and he is the deputy chief,
and I'm a lieutenant.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.015
-Frank, Ray.
-Irwin.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.726
Heard that was some press conference.

30:53.810 --> 30:54.853
FRANK: I have work to get to, Irwin.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.897
I thought maybe you could use
a book report from the mayor's office.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.357
I was about to give him a call.

30:59.899 --> 31:00.942
Don't.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.653
He won't accept it. He's furious.

31:03.736 --> 31:05.238
He's talking insubordination.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.824
He's talking about how bad
this kind of thing is

31:07.907 --> 31:09.409
for the department, for the city.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.785
What about Stop 'N' Cop?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.704
Whether he shuts it down
or keeps it going,

31:12.787 --> 31:15.373
you have given him a first-class
candidate for scapegoat.

31:15.957 --> 31:19.294
The best advice I can give you
is to keep a low profile.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.548
Other business. Anything you can
give me on Timothy Mullins?

31:23.631 --> 31:24.549
Drawing a blank.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.635
Then you should, know he is probably
gonna walk this afternoon.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.845
Can't you jack up his bail?

31:28.928 --> 31:30.972
On a lousy resisting? (scoffs)

31:31.055 --> 31:33.308
That's 500 and a kiss on the cheek, tops.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.893
You keep telling me
what bad dudes they are.

31:34.976 --> 31:35.810
They don't get much worse.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.854
Then why can't you keep them
for more than a day?

31:37.937 --> 31:39.355
Because that takes a witness.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.359
(sighs) Whose court are we in?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.821
-Oberman.
-Oh, too bad.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.617
If it was Wachtel, we could probably get
a summary execution.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.583
Sergeant, do you have photocopies
of the Pirado arrest report?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.084
Yeah, I think so.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.795
Your witness still playing it quiet, huh?

32:02.879 --> 32:03.713
Yes.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.298
-Ms. Davenport?
-What?

32:06.257 --> 32:07.175
I know it's none of my business,

32:07.258 --> 32:09.510
but what about this other case,
the Mullins thing?

32:10.887 --> 32:11.721
What about it?

32:12.388 --> 32:15.391
Well, I don't know.
Everybody thinks that you saw him.

32:16.100 --> 32:16.935
Including you?

32:17.852 --> 32:21.064
I admire you, but I guess so. I do.

32:21.689 --> 32:24.275
None of you were there, but you're
convinced I saw Timothy Mullins.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.527
-Well, I can understand--
-Sergeant, you're right.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.572
It's none of your business.
I'm not on trial with you people.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.158
Yeah, well, nobody's gonna be on trial.

32:38.873 --> 32:41.709
Ms. Davenport, if you've got a witness
who can prove self-defense,

32:41.793 --> 32:43.002
you better get him in here.

32:45.421 --> 32:47.465
One thousand dollars cash bail.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.425
Short date for hearing.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.678
-(bangs gavel)
-Next case.

32:52.220 --> 32:55.014
BAILIFF: Docket number N679342,

32:55.098 --> 32:59.227
Timothy Mullins,
charged with 145-20, resisting arrest.

33:09.862 --> 33:13.074
Hats off in the rear.
Hats off in the rear.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.371
This is a piece of garbage, Your Honor.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.540
Resisting arrest and no underlying charge?

33:20.623 --> 33:24.002
Defendant was legitimately arrested
as a homicide suspect.

33:24.085 --> 33:24.919
Then why isn't he so charged?

33:25.003 --> 33:26.504
IRWIN: We are building our case,
Your Honor,

33:26.587 --> 33:29.841
and in consideration of the evidence
we feel we will be able to produce,

33:29.924 --> 33:31.926
people ask $10,000 bail.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.971
Ten thousand dollars on a resisting,
Mr. DA?

33:35.054 --> 33:37.974
Protecting the city against a civil suit.
Oldest trick in the courthouse.

33:38.057 --> 33:38.975
That's not so.

33:39.767 --> 33:43.438
I must say, if the charge were murder,
that'd be one thing,

33:43.521 --> 33:46.274
but on a paltry resisting...

33:48.526 --> 33:49.527
(sighs)

33:53.573 --> 33:55.450
Bail is set at $500.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.577
Short date for hearing. (bangs gavel)

33:57.660 --> 33:58.619
Next case.

33:58.703 --> 33:59.912
MS. TALBOT: Your Honor...

34:01.748 --> 34:03.458
Your Honor, may I please
be allowed to speak?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.377
-Who are you?
-Linda Talbot, Your Honor.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.797
My father was Mr. Lionel Talbot,
and there is something

34:09.881 --> 34:12.216
that I would like to say
to you and to this court.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.052
The arraignment's been decided.
No public comments.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.054
My father was a hero!

34:17.221 --> 34:20.183
He stood up so a man's killer
could be punished,

34:20.266 --> 34:24.103
and now no one-- no one will stand up
against the man who killed him!

34:24.437 --> 34:26.439
-JUDGE: Bailiff, kindly--
-What is it about him

34:27.023 --> 34:28.941
that makes you all so scared?

34:30.568 --> 34:32.820
He isn't worth the life
that my father gave.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.822
He was too good.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.452
You all are cowards.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.204
You are just cowards.

34:43.873 --> 34:44.999
I can walk.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.179
Your Honor, may I approach?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.224
It pertains to this case.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.643
JUDGE: What is it, Ms. Davenport?

35:05.353 --> 35:06.854
If the DA will take a ten-minute recess,

35:06.938 --> 35:08.481
there's a witness
who wants to come forward.

35:08.564 --> 35:11.484
Then he can redraft
his papers to charge murder.

35:11.567 --> 35:14.028
-Oh, come on.
-Please, Your Honor, ten minutes.

35:16.489 --> 35:17.406
Granted.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.326
Deposit Mr. Mullins in holding
till we resume.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.370
The court stands recessed for ten minutes.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.247
She says they've got a witness
against you.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.082
She lies! There ain't no witness!

35:26.833 --> 35:28.209
Don't worry about it, bro.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.795
You ain't got to worry
about no trouble from no witness.

35:30.878 --> 35:32.672
-Ain't that right, miss lady?
-FRANK: Arrest him!

35:32.755 --> 35:35.133
Arrest him on harassment.
Take him to Hill Street Station.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.178
You know what I'm saying, don't you?

35:47.228 --> 35:50.022
I don't know what I'm gonna do, Bobby.
I'm paralyzed.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.733
I feel like I got a big, old fat man
and his brother

35:52.817 --> 35:54.277
just squatting on my chest.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.070
(sighs) Why don't you try to call her?

35:56.571 --> 35:58.656
I've tried to call her.
There wasn't no answer.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.534
Bobby, I tell you, my life
has turned into a catastrophe,

36:01.617 --> 36:03.578
what with that little
head counter up there,

36:03.661 --> 36:05.496
and Daryl Ann's got my accidental baby.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.041
How hard can it be, Renko?
It's yes or no, isn't it?

36:11.127 --> 36:14.297
Bobby, what if I was to get married,

36:14.589 --> 36:15.673
and then in another week,

36:15.756 --> 36:18.551
the most beautiful woman in the world
were to fall in love with me,

36:18.634 --> 36:20.887
a woman with sensibilities who could cook,

36:20.970 --> 36:22.471
somebody I could spend all my money on?

36:22.555 --> 36:25.308
You already got somebody like that,
unless you're saying you don't love her.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.102
Of course I do. She's a fine woman.

36:28.477 --> 36:29.645
-But?
-But...

36:30.104 --> 36:35.443
there are a few aspects of everyday
existence in which she falls short.

36:35.818 --> 36:36.861
Like what?

36:37.320 --> 36:39.864
-I don't know.
-For crying out loud, Renko.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.452
She's young, she's healthy,
she's good-looking,

36:44.535 --> 36:47.246
she loves you,
which, by itself, is an amazing fact.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.123
What else do you want?

36:49.582 --> 36:51.918
What are you saving it for?
You're no kid anymore.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.757
The trouble with you, you only want women
who want nothing to do with you.

36:58.549 --> 36:59.675
Grow up, pal.

37:00.885 --> 37:01.886
Electricity's on.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.888
Lieutenant wants everybody ready to move.

37:05.306 --> 37:06.390
HENRY: Mr. Hutchcraft?

37:07.683 --> 37:10.311
Mr. Hutchcraft, your lights are on,
just like I promised.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.104
Will you send Mr. Tasco out?

37:14.732 --> 37:17.360
You remember what you promised,
don't you, Mr. Hutchcraft?

37:18.319 --> 37:19.153
Okay.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.446
Good.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.365
Letting him toward the door now?

37:22.823 --> 37:25.493
MAN: All right, you people,
get back inside there.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.664
Back behind the yellow barricade.
Thank you.

37:38.130 --> 37:38.965
Where is he?

37:41.842 --> 37:44.262
Blue Fox, do you hear anything?

37:44.679 --> 37:46.639
Anything from the interior
of that apartment?

37:47.181 --> 37:48.015
Over.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.308
MAN (on radio): <i>Negative.</i>

37:49.850 --> 37:51.185
Mr. Hutchcraft?

37:52.019 --> 37:52.979
Mr. Hutchcraft...

37:55.314 --> 37:56.148
What?

37:58.442 --> 38:00.194
But the lights are on, Mr. Hutchcraft.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.737
Please. I can see them from here.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.239
-(gunshots)
-MAN: Shots fired!

38:03.322 --> 38:04.156
-Bust it!
-MAN: Move out!

38:04.240 --> 38:05.157
Let's go.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.000
-Frank, we lost the hostage.
-I heard on the way down.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.751
-They're bringing in the suspect.
-Where's Mullins?

38:15.835 --> 38:16.794
Interrogation.

38:20.881 --> 38:22.967
-Where's my lawyer?
-FRANK: You don't have one.

38:23.509 --> 38:25.720
-Well, get her.
-You had a lawyer.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.055
At the moment, you're not entitled to one.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.890
I want to see that lawyer again.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.309
Shut up.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.519
I was thinking I just might do her,

38:34.603 --> 38:37.773
but now I'm thinking
I'm gonna put a hurting on her.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.233
I'm gonna make it nasty.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.572
If she ever hears from you,

38:44.864 --> 38:47.533
if she even sees you
across a crowded street,

38:48.075 --> 38:50.369
you better pray she stays healthy,
my friend.

38:50.453 --> 38:54.498
You better pray she doesn't even
catch a cold or trip and turn an ankle,

38:54.582 --> 38:56.000
because I swear to you,

38:56.083 --> 38:58.461
if anything happens to my wife,
I'll kill you.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.592
-Book him.
-WILLIAM: Tell her, chump.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.261
Tell her I'm coming.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.700
Close the door, Frank.

39:33.621 --> 39:37.458
We've got a problem here, Frank.
Let me tell you what I've been thinking.

39:39.418 --> 39:42.421
We've seen some dark nights
through till dawn, time and again.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.342
I like to think we've learned,
we've grown together,

39:46.425 --> 39:47.343
my best captain.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.054
-Chief--
-There's been some damage, Frank.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.056
We're gonna take some time.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.308
We're gonna have
to rebuild your career now.

39:54.767 --> 39:55.601
What?

39:55.810 --> 39:57.395
I can't keep you on the Hill.

39:58.437 --> 40:00.689
I've cleared out a spot for you
as a liaison officer

40:00.773 --> 40:04.819
on a federal task force out of Division,
policing the neighborhood.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.195
Does this come from Cleveland?

40:06.278 --> 40:08.989
I told you I couldn't
protect you on this, Frank.

40:09.865 --> 40:11.450
You had your chance to make amends,

40:11.534 --> 40:13.744
and you threw it right back
in Ozzie's face.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.538
-His order.
-Damn it, Frank.

40:15.621 --> 40:16.831
You brought it on yourself.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.916
You forced my hand. You're out! That's it!

40:23.796 --> 40:26.549
There will be an announcement
out of my office this afternoon.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.092
I suggest you split the command

40:28.175 --> 40:30.344
between senior officers
Hunter and Calletano.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.472
As soon as the dust clears,
I'll transfer someone over.

40:35.224 --> 40:39.478
Frank... there is a burn-out factor
to command on the Hill.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.730
I should have headed this off
six months ago.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.065
I should have seen it coming.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.192
We'll turn this around.

40:46.068 --> 40:47.361
We'll salvage your career.

40:48.946 --> 40:49.780
I swear it.

41:10.843 --> 41:11.719
Frank?

41:13.053 --> 41:15.347
My records are in the cabinet.
The keys are in here.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.808
I'll probably have to spend
a little time up here tomorrow.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.602
If not, you can reach me at Division.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.731
-Frank...
-This is madness.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.407
Excuse me, Captain.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.409
What is it, Mick?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.869
This isn't working out there.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.288
These dirt bags,
they hear you on the news,

41:39.371 --> 41:41.415
it cuts the floor right out from under us.

41:41.957 --> 41:43.876
And maybe that isn't the best way
to run this whole thing.

41:43.959 --> 41:46.587
Uh, well, you'll want to know that
Chief Daniels agrees with you.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.255
I have been relieved of my command.

41:48.797 --> 41:49.632
What?

41:51.217 --> 41:52.801
Captain, I didn't mean it that way.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.554
What did he say?

41:56.889 --> 41:59.767
(sirens wailing)

42:06.941 --> 42:08.609
I was proud of you in that courtroom.

42:24.083 --> 42:26.377
You'll forgive me
if I don't feel quite the heroine.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.088
I've never been more terrified.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.965
Joyce, I'll protect you.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.968
From your cubicle
at Division headquarters?

42:34.343 --> 42:36.595
Frank, they can't protect popes
and presidents.

42:40.182 --> 42:42.059
This isn't the best day
of my life, either.

42:43.644 --> 42:44.478
JOYCE: I'm sorry.

42:47.064 --> 42:48.065
(sighs)

42:50.609 --> 42:52.736
I guess you can report
to your new job and...

42:54.530 --> 42:56.240
see if it makes any sense.

42:57.199 --> 42:58.617
What kind of advice is that?

43:04.081 --> 43:07.585
I don't know, Frank.
I don't know what you want me to say.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.380
I'm standing here afraid for my life.

43:11.463 --> 43:13.882
I talked to Henry.
You'll have guards round-the-clock.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.050
For how long, Frank?

43:16.427 --> 43:17.970
A couple of weeks, a month?

43:19.555 --> 43:24.101
The new captain might not consider that
a proper allocation for manpower.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.562
I can't trust that, can I?

43:32.776 --> 43:35.988
-So, I'm going to trust this.
-Damn it, Joyce, that's no answer.

43:36.071 --> 43:38.324
Damn you, Frank, the only time I've ever
needed you to be a real cop,

43:38.407 --> 43:40.159
and you had to go blow your mouth off.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.371
Boy, I feel as if
you're a thousand miles away.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.376
I feel like you're a million.

43:55.382 --> 43:56.300
Where are you going?

43:57.676 --> 43:58.510
FRANK: Out.

44:02.222 --> 44:03.474
(crying)

44:13.984 --> 44:16.528
What is that? What, two, three?

44:16.612 --> 44:18.197
-Two.
-Three? Two.

44:21.283 --> 44:23.619
You know, I think it's crazy,
them canning the captain, you know.

44:23.702 --> 44:26.330
They've done crazier things before, Coff.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.123
Oh, it's just a temporary thing.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.917
It's like a slap on the wrist,
right, Lieutenant?

44:30.793 --> 44:31.627
Let's hope so.

44:32.086 --> 44:35.714
Well, I'm putting in for a transfer.
I don't care what suit they ship in.

44:35.798 --> 44:37.216
The captain ain't back, I'm gone.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.135
Now, team, I am as upset
as the next person,

44:40.219 --> 44:43.681
but while we been moping around,
in case you haven't noticed,

44:43.764 --> 44:45.391
we've been getting our butts caved in.

44:45.474 --> 44:48.060
Come on, Renko.
A big "X" puts us right back in it.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.401
All right!

44:55.484 --> 44:58.570
LUCY (laughs): Andrewski! Very good!

44:59.905 --> 45:01.323
Okay, so you put an "X" like that.

45:01.782 --> 45:02.741
What's my score now?

45:02.825 --> 45:05.035
Just a second. Okay, two balls...

45:05.119 --> 45:07.538
(woman cheers)

45:24.304 --> 45:26.265
Hey, if I keep this up,
I'm gonna have my average

45:26.348 --> 45:28.726
up over 150 first night of the season.

45:31.937 --> 45:32.771
What?

45:33.689 --> 45:35.315
Andy, why don't you grow up?

45:36.608 --> 45:37.901
I just need more time, that's all.

45:37.985 --> 45:42.322
Well, I don't have more time.
You've gotta make up your mind.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.490
I can't.

45:45.826 --> 45:49.872
I... had a baby once, six years ago.

45:49.955 --> 45:50.831
I know that.

45:50.914 --> 45:53.500
I'm trying to take all that
into consideration, you understand me?

45:54.209 --> 45:57.713
And I had to give him up for adoption
because I had no proper home for him,

45:58.672 --> 46:00.716
and I won't go through
the hurt of that again.

46:01.925 --> 46:03.260
Andy, I got my pride.

46:04.303 --> 46:05.429
I know who I am.

46:05.512 --> 46:09.892
Maybe it's not all that much,
but I like myself.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.311
It's the first time in my life
I can say that,

46:12.394 --> 46:13.812
and you have a lot to do with it.

46:17.232 --> 46:23.197
I love you, but if you won't marry me,
I'll have an abortion.

46:24.656 --> 46:25.908
So you gotta decide.

46:28.076 --> 46:32.164
I mean...
I don't know who else you'd marry.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.000
I can't imagine. Can you?

46:35.959 --> 46:37.336
LUCY: Come on, Renko! You're up!

46:41.089 --> 46:41.924
I'm scared.

46:42.716 --> 46:44.176
Shoot, what do you think I am?

46:46.428 --> 46:48.347
But we have a chance to build a life,

46:49.848 --> 46:51.975
and maybe it'll work out
and maybe it won't,

46:53.435 --> 46:55.229
but I'm telling you, I'm willing to try.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.314
JOE: Hey, come on, Andy!
You're holding us up!

47:06.156 --> 47:07.324
I'll be back.

47:13.121 --> 47:14.331
Hey!

47:19.837 --> 47:20.671
What are you doing?

47:22.339 --> 47:23.674
Robert, make my spare.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.677
JOE: Hey, Renko, you got another ball!

47:34.810 --> 47:38.772
(siren wailing)

47:48.031 --> 47:48.866
Help you?

47:49.658 --> 47:52.411
Uh, scotch, a fifth.

47:52.786 --> 47:54.204
Anything in particular?

47:55.664 --> 47:56.707
Whatever you say.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.131
Yeah, that's fine.

48:04.965 --> 48:05.966
That'll be it for you?

48:23.817 --> 48:26.820
(closing theme playing)
