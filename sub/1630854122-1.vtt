WEBVTT

00:14.579 --> 00:16.451
Ah! Your ring! Your ring!

00:16.538 --> 00:18.453
- I'm sorry?
- Your ring. You dropped it.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.455
- Oh, no.
- 50 Euros.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.239
50 Euros.
- Don't get involved.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.589
It's a scam.
The ring's worthless metal.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.635
She's trying to screw you
into thinking it's gold.

00:26.722 --> 00:27.723
Thank you.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.206
Brandon Davis. Yeah, good.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.946
Heading past
the Rue de Rivoli now.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.600
I'll be there
in about ten minutes.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.037
Yeah.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.603
Hey. You Davis?

01:18.382 --> 01:21.516
<i>Mom, where are you?</i>

01:21.603 --> 01:23.909
<i>I have to go. I'm in danger.</i>

01:25.563 --> 01:28.610
<i>Pavel Novikoff
leaves Russia CIA.</i>

01:31.221 --> 01:32.701
<i>How do you know my mother?</i>

01:32.788 --> 01:34.920
I recruited her
to spy for Russia.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.358
But at a certain point,
she flipped back

01:37.445 --> 01:40.274
<i>and became a double agent.</i>

01:40.361 --> 01:42.841
The hit team--two brothers.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.365
<i>I saw them both.</i>

01:46.845 --> 01:48.586
My mom helped me
bring in Novikoff.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.545
Helped us.

01:50.632 --> 01:53.896
<i>Forget about me. I love you.</i>

01:53.983 --> 01:55.767
- Anything on him?
- No.

01:55.854 --> 01:56.942
Cheers.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.292
We have
his photo out everywhere.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.164
- Touch my parking spot.
- No, no, no. No, no.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.079
Later.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.734
Boss!

03:32.821 --> 03:33.996
You don't have to
call me that.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.041
Oh, I was talking to Tank.
Hi!

03:36.128 --> 03:37.739
Yeah, that's--

03:37.826 --> 03:39.262
That's accurate.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.742
Oh, Raines, uh,
I need to talk to you

03:40.829 --> 03:42.483
one-on-one today
when you get a minute.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.615
Uh-oh. Do I need to alert
the Agents Association

03:44.702 --> 03:45.921
I might need a lawyer?

03:47.575 --> 03:49.533
It's nothing like that.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.969
What are you guys
hanging around for?

03:51.056 --> 03:51.927
We've got company.

03:58.847 --> 03:59.848
Smitty.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.329
Scott Forrester. Oh!

04:02.416 --> 04:04.548
How are you, mate?
- I'm good.

04:04.635 --> 04:07.421
Everyone, this is
Megan Garretson with Europol.

04:07.508 --> 04:10.250
Did I, uh, just hear him
call you "Smitty"?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.817
Oh, yeah.
My friends call me that.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.254
Long story.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.517
We worked Trojan Shield together.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.997
Oh, wow, that was a hell
of an operation.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.521
Yeah, we studied that
at Quantico.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.957
800 arrests, over two tons

04:22.044 --> 04:23.872
of synthetic drugs
off the streets.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.874
- Team effort.
- Mm-hmm.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.137
- How's Katrin Jaeger?
- Promoted.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.095
She's in charged of all
of Western Europe now.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.228
Not gonna lie,
she's my personal hero.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.838
Well,
she's definitely missed.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.492
- So you're in Budapest now.
- I am.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.015
Your new Europol liaison.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.322
Katrin thought I'd be able
to jump into the deep end

04:39.409 --> 04:40.845
since we already have
a shorthand.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.152
Absolutely.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.241
And of course,
I understand I have

04:45.328 --> 04:48.766
enormous shoes to fill,
but I intend to do just that.

04:48.853 --> 04:53.075
Well, it goes without saying:
welcome aboard.

04:53.162 --> 04:56.339
And good timing
'cause we just caught a case.

04:56.426 --> 04:59.560
The DGSI is requesting
our assistance in Paris.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.605
Yesterday,
an American police detective

05:01.692 --> 05:03.477
was stabbed to death
in the 8th arrondissement.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.826
From where?

05:04.913 --> 05:06.393
City of Dover
Police Department.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.699
Brandon Davis.
He was on a federal task force.

05:08.786 --> 05:11.093
Davis and the DGSI
had teamed up

05:11.180 --> 05:12.573
to investigate
an American weapons company

05:12.660 --> 05:14.314
out of Delaware.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.533
Then let's get to France.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.417
<i>Chef Départmental Beaumont.</i>

05:30.504 --> 05:32.244
I'm Special Agent
Scott Forrester.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.551
This is Special Agent Kellett,
Vo, Raines, and with Europol...

05:34.638 --> 05:35.813
Megan Garretson.

05:35.900 --> 05:36.771
Please.

05:39.643 --> 05:42.167
Detective Davis was
investigating a company

05:42.254 --> 05:44.822
named RedGrave out of Delaware.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.651
He believed it was a shell
company for arms dealing,

05:47.738 --> 05:49.610
brokering illegal weapon sales

05:49.697 --> 05:51.612
between the U.S., France,
and the Middle East.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.179
Now, like with many
of these cowboy traffickers,

05:54.266 --> 05:56.225
the company looks legitimate
on paper,

05:56.312 --> 05:59.184
with legal sales
of firearms, handguns

05:59.271 --> 06:02.579
to retailers in the U.S.,
South America, parts of Africa.

06:02.666 --> 06:03.928
But when you pull back
the curtain,

06:04.015 --> 06:05.365
as Detective Davis did,

06:05.452 --> 06:07.105
you see they've rented
minimal office space

06:07.192 --> 06:08.716
in the U.S., Paris, Egypt,

06:08.803 --> 06:10.761
and they're selling
entire weapons systems

06:10.848 --> 06:12.241
that are completely illegal

06:12.328 --> 06:14.417
in most territories
around the world.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.419
He came to us
with his suspicions,

06:16.506 --> 06:18.813
and the DGSI initiated
a joint investigation

06:18.900 --> 06:20.292
between us,
the City of Dover Police,

06:20.380 --> 06:22.686
and his U.S. task force.

06:22.773 --> 06:23.948
We don't have RedGrave
on our radar,

06:24.035 --> 06:26.908
but we have been monitoring
the Paris-Cairo corridor.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.389
There were 10 billion
in legal arm sales

06:29.476 --> 06:31.695
between Europe and Egypt
over the last five years.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.219
The number for illegal sales...

06:34.306 --> 06:35.699
five times that much.
- Yes.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.788
Do you have case files
for Detective Davis?

06:37.875 --> 06:40.312
Yes--all we have
is at your disposal.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.879
We were happy to collaborate
with him.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.141
I worked with him directly.

06:43.228 --> 06:46.623
He was a good man. Smart.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.103
Well, we're gonna do
everything in our power

06:48.190 --> 06:49.321
to find who did this.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.671
As will Europol.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.324
We're gonna need to see
texts, phone logs,

06:52.412 --> 06:53.717
laptop files, anything you can
give us on your end.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.458
And I'll check in
with his task force

06:55.545 --> 06:56.894
to see what he was
sharing stateside.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.243
Good.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.680
I should add,
we recently registered

06:59.767 --> 07:01.769
an informant by the name
of Corine Descroches.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.118
I believe she's the last person

07:03.205 --> 07:05.033
that Davis met with in Paris
before he--

07:05.120 --> 07:07.557
before--well.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.385
She has an address
in the Marais.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.691
We haven't talked to her yet.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.214
The investigation
is moving very quickly.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.694
All right, we'll take it. Yep.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.004
So Smitty.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.528
Yeah.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.966
She is our kind of agent--
head down, plow forward.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.446
All about the work.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.230
And she can drink you
under the table.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.623
- Ah.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.711
What I wanna know is,

07:30.798 --> 07:32.713
how do you get
the name "Smitty"

07:32.800 --> 07:34.323
from Megan Garretson?

07:34.410 --> 07:35.803
There's a question
I asked her myself.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.544
And?

07:37.631 --> 07:41.199
She said something about
a need-to-know basis and yeah.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.506
Never got beyond that.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.685
<i>Oui?</i>

07:48.772 --> 07:51.253
Corine Des-roches?
Forgive my pronunciation.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.515
What is this about?

07:52.602 --> 07:54.038
We need to talk to you

07:54.125 --> 07:57.738
about an American detective
named Brandon Davis.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.653
- I don't know.
- He died yesterday.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.655
I--

08:01.742 --> 08:02.699
how?

08:02.786 --> 08:03.526
Murdered.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.577
How'd you know Brandon?

08:10.664 --> 08:13.884
I--I work for a company
named Chimique

08:13.971 --> 08:15.495
here in Paris.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.671
We're a subsidiary
of an American company.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.195
RedGrave.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.240
And what did you do for them?

08:22.327 --> 08:23.851
Answer phones.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.853
Take clients out
when they come to town.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.550
I was a model,
but magazine covers

08:27.637 --> 08:30.335
go to celebrities now, so I--

08:30.422 --> 08:32.468
it was an offer
for a nice salary

08:32.555 --> 08:33.948
and regular employment.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.039
But I heard things at Chimique
that terrified me.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.954
What kind of things?

08:40.041 --> 08:41.869
Illegal weapons.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.174
Chemical, biological.

08:43.261 --> 08:45.350
I heard my boss say,
"mass casualties."

08:45.437 --> 08:47.091
I told my roommate, Chloe,

08:47.178 --> 08:49.050
and she said
to call the police.

08:49.137 --> 08:49.964
Did you?

08:50.051 --> 08:51.748
Yes.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.055
That is when
the American detective came.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.404
He listened to my story,

08:55.491 --> 08:57.624
said he was
investigating Chimique

08:57.711 --> 09:00.104
with the French special police.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.454
He asked me if I would record
my bosses' conversations,

09:02.542 --> 09:05.457
but I was afraid--I couldn't.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.155
We understand.

09:07.242 --> 09:10.201
There were horrible men
who would do business with us.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.552
With Keith.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.946
Pigs from all over the world.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.426
They would want me to--

09:20.081 --> 09:22.039
I didn't know what
I'd gotten myself into.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.217
- Who is Keith?
- My boss.

09:26.304 --> 09:29.394
Keith Panzarasa. He's American.
He--

09:29.481 --> 09:31.701
I told him I needed to quit,

09:31.788 --> 09:35.313
that I had lined up some work,
even though it wasn't true.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.360
I needed to get out. Get away.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.275
How'd he take that?

09:40.362 --> 09:42.799
Not well.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.671
And how many employees
are at Chimique?

09:44.758 --> 09:46.803
Just Keith, me,
and a few other men

09:46.890 --> 09:49.458
that would come and go
and I was not to ask about.

09:51.895 --> 09:52.853
All right.

09:58.554 --> 10:01.165
Don't leave Paris
until we hear from Keith, okay?

10:05.430 --> 10:08.390
Companies like RedGrave hire
women like that all the time.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.261
Eye candy for the scum
they do business with.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.002
Well, she was brave
to come forward.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.395
I have a pretty good detector
for when someone

10:13.482 --> 10:15.919
is shining us on, and she
looked genuinely scared.

10:16.006 --> 10:16.877
All right,
call Raines and Vo.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.052
Have them check out Chimique.

10:58.483 --> 11:01.791
Looks like Chimique had
a going-out-of-business sale.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.732
Whoever was here,
we just missed 'em.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.043
They took the Wi-Fi hubs,

11:36.130 --> 11:38.698
but they didn't clean out
the router.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.879
Because they didn't know
it was stored in the ceiling.

11:49.534 --> 11:52.059
This will have memory cached.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.930
We may not know every keystroke
they made in this office,

11:54.017 --> 11:55.671
but we'll know
what websites they--

12:37.713 --> 12:39.106
Go!

12:45.199 --> 12:46.461
Did you see that?

12:46.548 --> 12:48.376
What?

12:48.463 --> 12:50.160
It's diplomatic plates.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.174
You uh, you some duct tape?

13:04.261 --> 13:05.610
Maybe some superglue
for that, Raines?

13:05.697 --> 13:07.569
I've pulled information
from far worse than this.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.832
We had a case where a guy
ran over a laptop

13:09.919 --> 13:12.443
with a two ton tractor,
Raines didn't even blink.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.576
Recovered ten years of photos

13:14.663 --> 13:16.491
the guy thought he erased
from existence.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.145
Which came in handy
at his trial.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.451
- One year for every photo.
- Wicked.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.627
Yeah, well,
I try to be humble,

13:22.714 --> 13:24.325
but I admit it.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.589
I amaze myself sometimes.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.243
Here's a list of
all the web traffic

13:29.330 --> 13:31.680
through Chimique's office
over the last two months.

13:31.767 --> 13:32.681
What's this batch?

13:35.553 --> 13:37.381
Fontainebleau.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.949
It's a small suburb
south of Paris with a chateau.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.908
It's not much.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.301
Could RedGrave or Chimique
be operating at the chateau?

13:44.388 --> 13:48.175
No, it's a museum.
Napoleon, Marie Antoinette.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.525
There's a forest
in the town nearby,

13:50.612 --> 13:52.440
but I don't see
how it could be consequential.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.834
Well, Keith Panzarasa
isn't here to play tourist.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.271
That town means something.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.359
All right,
let's get any traffic cams

13:58.446 --> 14:00.274
to and from Fontainebleau
over the last two weeks.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.406
Maybe we can
spot him scouting it

14:02.493 --> 14:03.799
or if his company made
any purchases there

14:03.886 --> 14:06.019
or just what the hell his
interest is in suburban Paris.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.716
Yes, of course.
I'll alert the municipal police

14:07.803 --> 14:09.805
in Fontainebleau to be on
the lookout for your American.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.112
Thank you.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.940
Brandon Davis,
the slain detective,

14:14.027 --> 14:17.073
had these keys in his pocket
when the body was recovered.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.945
Paris police believe
they belong to an apartment

14:19.032 --> 14:21.164
in the 8th he was renting.
We haven't been inside.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.557
I'll go with you
to check it out.

14:22.644 --> 14:23.950
Okay, Raines, Vo, and I
will stay on

14:24.037 --> 14:25.081
the Fontainebleau angle, yeah?

14:38.573 --> 14:41.358
So you and Forrester worked
Trojan Shield together.

14:41.445 --> 14:44.405
Yeah, we spent 14 months
in Stockholm

14:44.492 --> 14:46.929
building a distribution case
on narcotics

14:47.016 --> 14:49.932
traveling from Afghanistan
to Scandinavia

14:50.019 --> 14:52.804
to the UK and on to New York.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.677
A lot of surveillance.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.985
A lot of punsch rolls
and ultimately, 30 arrests,

14:59.072 --> 15:01.074
including an airport firefight.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.554
- Intense.
- It was.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.774
I was in my first year
at Europol.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.733
So I like to say everything
I know about determination,

15:08.820 --> 15:12.433
bravery, and focus
I learned from Scott.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.522
Yeah, he has
that effect on people.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.393
Indeed.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.918
Did you always want
to work in law enforcement?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.441
My mother had
Agatha Christie novels

15:20.528 --> 15:21.659
lying around when I was a kid.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.227
"Miss Marple,"
"Sherlock Holmes."

15:24.314 --> 15:25.794
I never needed to get
to the denouement

15:25.881 --> 15:27.796
to know who the killer was.
- Yeah?

15:27.883 --> 15:30.538
My parents hoped I would go
to Oxford or Cambridge,

15:30.625 --> 15:33.976
but I went to Manchester
to study criminology.

15:34.063 --> 15:38.763
And to cheer on United,
but that's a much longer story.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.940
Ever heard of a company
called Dechets?

15:41.027 --> 15:42.332
Dechets?

15:42.419 --> 15:43.725
They're the waste management company.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.770
I've seen their trucks
on the autoroute.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.642
Detective Davis has files
and files on this company.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.600
There are two open binders
on his desk.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.217
What?

15:57.304 --> 15:59.523
78% of France's power
is nuclear.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.221
Right.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.526
Dechets recycles
the country's

16:02.613 --> 16:04.964
spent plutonium fuel rods.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.493
Dechets transports plutonium
fuel rods from reactors

16:12.580 --> 16:14.234
across the country
up to Hague for recycling.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.410
A truck is moving
from a power plant in...

16:16.497 --> 16:18.934
- Dampierre.
- Dampierre through...

16:19.021 --> 16:20.936
- Let me guess, Fontainebleau. <i>
- Exactly.</i>

16:21.023 --> 16:22.807
- When? <i>
- Now.</i>

16:22.894 --> 16:23.808
Let's go. Let's go.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.184
Move, move, move.

16:56.841 --> 16:57.581
Hold your fire.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.831
They're running.
They're running.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.659
Go, go, go.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.731
Okay, so best
we can piece together

18:00.818 --> 18:02.081
from Detective Davis'
case files,

18:02.168 --> 18:04.300
plus DGSI's
ongoing investigation,

18:04.387 --> 18:06.998
Keith Panzarasa
is an arms merchant

18:07.086 --> 18:09.740
who uses legitimate companies
as fronts for fencing weapons

18:09.827 --> 18:12.656
from the U.S. through Europe
to the Middle East.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.790
RedGrave, Chimique,
half a dozen other shells

18:15.877 --> 18:19.489
were selling AK-47's, Uzis,
and other small arms legally

18:19.576 --> 18:22.449
while taking orders for
bigger arms under the table.

18:22.536 --> 18:25.713
Stinger missiles,
Sidewinders, Hellfire.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.193
All of it illegal.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.673
Detective Davis suspected
Panzarasa was planning

18:29.760 --> 18:32.372
a career score with
a narrow window of opportunity.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.504
He teamed up with DGSI
here in France

18:34.591 --> 18:36.680
but was killed before he could
act on his suspicion.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.770
Okay, so now, Panzarasa
has radioactive material

18:39.857 --> 18:43.513
that could explode in a dirty
bomb in any city in the world.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.647
A few sticks of dynamite
in a briefcase--boom.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.039
It could make a city unlivable

18:48.127 --> 18:50.085
for nearly the next
half century.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.827
Panzarasa will be looking to
offload the plutonium quickly.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.830
It stands to reason he lined
up a buyer before the score.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.571
All right, we need to find
out the who, the what, the why,

18:57.658 --> 19:00.226
the where, the when
Panzarasa was meeting with

19:00.313 --> 19:03.054
in the months leading up to
this robbery, okay?

19:10.061 --> 19:12.586
Special Agent Vo reported
that the van that picked up

19:12.673 --> 19:15.502
Panzarasa outside Chimique's
offices had diplomatic plates.

19:15.589 --> 19:16.764
Yes?

19:16.851 --> 19:20.246
That's because
he's a diplomat

19:20.333 --> 19:22.813
of the country of Dondi
in West Africa.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.946
- What the hell is this?
- He's American.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.426
And white.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.689
Well, apparently,
West African Dondi

19:28.776 --> 19:29.994
has a sign saying,
"Open for Business"

19:30.081 --> 19:31.648
on their embassy doors.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.520
They've been selling
fraudulent passports

19:33.607 --> 19:35.086
to anyone who has
a big enough checkbook,

19:35.174 --> 19:37.654
allowing them to skip
proper customs channels.

19:37.741 --> 19:38.960
You can't be serious.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.701
International complaints
have been filed,

19:40.788 --> 19:42.137
sanctions threatened.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.705
Each time Dondi cries pardon,
begs forgiveness,

19:44.792 --> 19:47.664
and then does it all again
when the dust settles.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.188
Apparently, they think
it's more lucrative

19:49.275 --> 19:50.754
than collecting taxes.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.061
Why weren't we given
this information sooner?

19:53.148 --> 19:55.411
There are 13,000
diplomats and staff

19:55.498 --> 19:57.283
from all over the world
working in France.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.893
I wish we had
flagged them sooner,

19:58.980 --> 20:00.503
but we're moving
as quickly as we can.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.940
Yeah. You're right.
Thank you.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.812
I have an idea.

20:04.899 --> 20:08.381
Let's use this information
to lure Panzarasa out.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.665
I need to speak
to Ambassador Dogo.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.102
- Do you have an appointment?
- This is my appointment.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.539
Tell him the United States
Federal Bureau of Investigation

20:36.626 --> 20:37.975
would like to speak
with him immediately.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.368
Yes, I will be with you
in a moment.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.369
Thank you.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.995
I believe I've been summoned.
How may I be of assistance?

20:58.082 --> 21:01.129
Well, one way you may be of
assistance is explaining to me

21:01.216 --> 21:04.001
why diplomatic passports are
being issued out of this office

21:04.088 --> 21:06.526
to non-Dondian citizens.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.136
I'm afraid I don't know
what she means.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.877
Talk to her.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.487
I have a feeling you know
exactly what I mean.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.184
Where's your closest
bathroom?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.403
Upstairs.
I will buzz you through.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.932
So how much are you charging
to make a mockery

21:22.019 --> 21:24.805
of diplomatic protections
put in place in good faith

21:24.892 --> 21:26.589
so that countries can
rely on each other,

21:26.676 --> 21:29.070
<i>so that they can
support one another?</i>

21:45.565 --> 21:48.481
<i>You got it?</i>

21:48.568 --> 21:49.308
I'm in.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.778
And if I need to get
the U.S. ambassador down here

22:24.865 --> 22:26.780
to weigh in on this mockery,
I'll do it,

22:26.867 --> 22:28.521
but I guarantee,
you will not like it.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.914
I do not appreciate
your tone.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.742
Oh, you think
my tone is the problem.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.527
<i>You need to
wrap this up, Vo.</i>

22:38.008 --> 22:39.967
Status update.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.969
<i>Planting an email
from the embassy to Panzarasa</i>

22:42.056 --> 22:44.014
telling him if he doesn't bring
a suitcase full of money

22:44.101 --> 22:45.320
to Montmartre today,

22:45.407 --> 22:47.540
his diplomatic status
will be revoked.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.630
- Send it.
- Almost there.

22:50.717 --> 22:51.631
<i>All right, listen.
We're running out of time.</i>

22:51.718 --> 22:53.850
Okay, I know. I know.
Just hold on.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.592
I don't care which
country you represent.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.638
Okay, Ambassador, maybe
we got off on the wrong foot.

22:58.725 --> 23:01.815
I'm an extremely busy man,
so please excuse me.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.955
It's sent.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.469
Thank you for your time.

23:47.556 --> 23:48.644
Of course.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.315
Got it?
- Hook is set.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.273
We know Panzarasa's gonna rely
on that diplomatic passport

24:09.360 --> 24:11.885
to get the hell out of dodge.
Either he pays or he's SOL.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.277
And what happens when
he replies to the email?

24:13.364 --> 24:15.671
It goes to my phone.

24:15.758 --> 24:16.759
Oh, well, remind me
not to send

24:16.846 --> 24:18.805
your employee evaluations
from my computer.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.807
Oh, we hack into those
all the time.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.199
And thank you
for the glowing reviews.

24:24.898 --> 24:25.507
Forrester.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.094
We've located the hijackers.
It seems they didn't secure

24:47.181 --> 24:50.184
the radioactive material
as well as they should have.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.171
Traffic cams confirm that
Panzarasa met the two hijackers

25:21.258 --> 25:22.999
here and left
with a silver briefcase

25:23.086 --> 25:26.960
presumably holding
a spent plutonium fuel rod.

25:27.047 --> 25:30.877
This is what will happen if a
dirty bomb explodes in Europe.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.750
It worked.
Panzarasa just responded.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.187
He's headed Montmartre
to pay off the ambassador now.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.885
That means
his deal is imminent.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.103
All right, let's snatch him up

25:40.190 --> 25:42.497
before he hands off
the material.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.521
No sign of him.

26:06.608 --> 26:09.045
Jerking our chain?

26:09.132 --> 26:10.003
He'll show.

26:18.751 --> 26:19.708
Got him.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.815
Get up.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.735
<i>Where's the fuel rod?</i>

28:13.822 --> 28:15.563
<i>I am sure that my attorney,</i>

28:15.650 --> 28:17.565
<i>Pierre Rochoux,
will be here any moment.</i>

28:17.652 --> 28:20.394
<i>Until her gets here,
I say nothing.</i>

28:20.481 --> 28:22.265
<i>Did you handle that
plutonium yourself, Keith?</i>

28:22.352 --> 28:24.180
Or did you have your two
hijackers move it for you

28:24.267 --> 28:26.008
because let me tell you,

28:26.095 --> 28:28.228
if you took
that case from them,

28:28.315 --> 28:30.709
you might need to see a doctor
more than an attorney.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.897
We can wait here
for another hour or two

28:44.984 --> 28:47.116
or we can get you
medical attention.

28:47.203 --> 28:51.251
Probably have some potassium
iodine prescribed for you.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.732
<i>Trust me,
you're gonna want to take it.</i>

28:55.995 --> 28:57.648
Or continue to rot here.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.085
Your choice.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.485
I wasn't
propositioning a sale.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.966
I was fulfilling an order.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.228
Who ordered it?

29:12.315 --> 29:15.579
<i>- I can't tell you that.
- Keith.</i>

29:15.666 --> 29:16.885
<i>It's probably on a ship
right now,</i>

29:16.972 --> 29:19.583
<i>headed to the Middle East.</i>

29:19.670 --> 29:21.020
<i>The people
I took the order from</i>

29:21.107 --> 29:22.586
are waging war
far away from Europe.

29:22.673 --> 29:23.674
Who are they?

29:26.982 --> 29:28.114
I want immunity.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.295
He killed a police officer.

29:35.382 --> 29:36.687
If he doesn't give up
those buyers,

29:36.775 --> 29:38.124
the whole globe
could be a target.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.516
We just sit back and wait

29:39.603 --> 29:41.780
until a bomb explodes
and contaminates a city?

29:41.867 --> 29:43.738
France will not allow immunity.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.348
I have an idea.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.094
Immunity

29:52.181 --> 29:54.140
or my skin falls off
in front of you

29:54.227 --> 29:55.750
and my mouth remains shut.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.622
I don't care.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.973
We'll make you an offer.

30:01.060 --> 30:04.237
Immunity's off the table, but

30:04.324 --> 30:07.414
France will waive
extradition to the U.S.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.503
You could get
one of the eight cells

30:09.590 --> 30:14.073
in the VIP section
of La Santé prison in Paris.

30:14.160 --> 30:18.468
This is where Noriega stayed,
Jean-Christophe Mitterrand.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.602
Or I allow my American friends
to pack you back to the U.S.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.647
where you end up in ADMAX.

30:23.734 --> 30:27.260
23 hours in a box,
1 hour to see the sky alone.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.610
That's if they don't push
for the death penalty.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.837
A dirty bomb is
not gonna be used

30:38.924 --> 30:42.144
in the desert over some
inter-tribal dispute.

30:42.231 --> 30:44.799
It's headed for Israel
or Europe or the U.S.,

30:44.886 --> 30:48.107
where it'll put some half-rate
terrorist group on the map.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.413
Sure, we'll hunt
those guys down,

30:50.500 --> 30:53.112
but you'll be the one
that gave them the capability.

30:53.199 --> 30:56.419
You will never
see the light of day again.

30:56.506 --> 30:59.727
Full weight will
come down on your head

30:59.814 --> 31:03.296
or La Santé

31:03.383 --> 31:06.865
where you can live in
relative comfort and security.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.170
It's your choice.

31:13.393 --> 31:16.352
You have 30 seconds
to write down a name.

31:34.414 --> 31:38.070
No wonder Dondi gave him
the diplomatic credentials.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.333
He sold the plutonium
to Omar Fane,

31:40.420 --> 31:42.378
a Dondi government enforcer
who's been fighting off

31:42.465 --> 31:44.815
coup attempts and radicalized
attacks in the capital.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.035
So he sets off
his contaminated bomb

31:47.122 --> 31:49.385
in the northern region,
wipes out the rebel groups,

31:49.472 --> 31:50.734
sends a message to the country

31:50.821 --> 31:53.172
that the capital tolerates
no insurrection.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.696
- Ruthless.
- I've got an address in Paris.

31:55.783 --> 31:56.697
Let's go.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.008
Clear.

32:04.618 --> 32:05.706
Clear.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.105
Clear.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.202
This is a manifesto.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.857
He's ranting about
the French massacres

32:26.945 --> 32:29.164
of Dondi citizens
as it formed the French Sudan.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.427
He's also ranting about
France stealing their resources

32:31.514 --> 32:33.255
and keeping Dondi
in permanent poverty.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.388
Oh, Omar Fane is not
smuggling a dirty bomb

32:35.475 --> 32:36.650
back into West Africa.

32:36.737 --> 32:39.087
He is going to
detonate it in Paris.

32:39.174 --> 32:41.872
He is using that manifesto
as a suicide note.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.265
So where's he gonna do it?

32:43.352 --> 32:44.658
Somewhere that
he visits frequently,

32:44.745 --> 32:46.573
scopes out, is familiar with.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.357
We need to figure out
where he's been,

32:48.444 --> 32:50.969
cams, receipts, witnesses,
anyone that knows him.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.585
Excuse me, sir.

32:58.672 --> 33:01.022
Do you know your neighbor
across the hall?

33:01.109 --> 33:04.025
Sir, we just need to see if
he's visited any landmarks--

33:29.268 --> 33:31.270
Any sign of him?

33:45.849 --> 33:46.807
There.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.090
There's not enough time
for snipers.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.353
And too many people to clear.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.355
- We don't know if he's wired.
- If we come in pointing guns,

34:13.442 --> 34:15.357
he's gonna trigger off the bomb
before we get a shot off.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.229
We have to separate him
from that bomb.

34:32.722 --> 34:34.463
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

34:34.550 --> 34:37.075
Could you happen to tell me
where the Champs-Elysées is?

34:37.162 --> 34:38.728
I'm a little lost here.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.692
Sir, we're just
asking for directions.

34:45.779 --> 34:46.693
Can you help us?

34:48.999 --> 34:50.740
Hey, can you help me
with this?

34:52.220 --> 34:53.656
Get back!

34:53.743 --> 34:55.789
- Everyone, get back. Police!
- Clear the area.

34:55.876 --> 34:57.573
Clear the area.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.750
Get back. Get back!
Everyone, back!

35:20.205 --> 35:21.467
Your levels are clear.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.599
The exposure wasn't
long enough to register.

35:23.686 --> 35:24.818
All right, still,
I'm gonna take about

35:24.905 --> 35:26.080
a four hour scrub down
when I get home.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.173
You guys ready
to get the hell out of here?

35:37.309 --> 35:40.964
Andre, Cameron, Jamie, Scott,

35:41.051 --> 35:43.837
thank you
on behalf of the DGSI.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.579
It would be my pleasure
to have you return any time.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.189
You know, one of
the great parts of this job

35:48.276 --> 35:50.278
is working with dedicated
law enforcement professionals

35:50.365 --> 35:51.584
like yourself,
Commander Beaumont.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.325
I feel the same.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.805
And I will talk to Detective
Davis' department in Dover,

35:55.892 --> 35:57.372
plus any family that
he has back in the States,

35:57.459 --> 36:01.376
let them know he died in action
helping to keep the world safe.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.900
However I can help,
please let me contribute.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.424
Will do.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.307
Oh, oh, uh.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.225
Hey.

36:24.312 --> 36:28.098
I know that you are set on the
management route at the bureau,

36:28.186 --> 36:30.100
which I fully respect,

36:30.188 --> 36:33.234
so I want you to be aware

36:33.321 --> 36:35.323
of the leadership course
in Washington this fall.

36:38.674 --> 36:39.762
Now, I'm gonna clear
your schedule from

36:39.849 --> 36:43.679
October to November
so that you can attend.

36:43.766 --> 36:46.552
But you see--
now, I have a plan.

36:46.639 --> 36:49.032
Because once you become
the director of the FBI,

36:49.119 --> 36:50.817
you're gonna remember
your old pal Forrester.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.688
You're gonna let me
head up any task force

36:52.775 --> 36:55.735
of my choosing, so...

36:55.822 --> 36:58.303
Anyway...

36:58.390 --> 36:59.826
you have my full support.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.396
No, thank you.

37:08.095 --> 37:12.752
No to the opportunity or

37:12.839 --> 37:14.841
no to my task force?

37:14.928 --> 37:17.322
To the opportunity.

37:17.409 --> 37:20.760
Look, I've spent a lot
of my time so far

37:20.847 --> 37:23.153
searching for the next rung
in the ladder.

37:23.241 --> 37:28.420
The next strategic move that
would be best for my career.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.639
But I realize working
with you and Kellett

37:30.726 --> 37:32.902
over the last few years--
like this case,

37:32.989 --> 37:35.209
where we were racing
to stop real terror

37:35.296 --> 37:37.037
from unfolding in the world.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.300
I like being a field agent.

37:39.387 --> 37:44.436
I like split-second decisions
that save thousands of lives.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.612
I don't want to be
behind a desk

37:46.699 --> 37:49.571
managing people.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.487
I want to be in the field
taking down the bad guys.

37:58.450 --> 38:01.104
So thank you for backing me.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.976
I truly appreciate it.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.247
Is it always
gonna be like this?

38:13.334 --> 38:15.162
Action, action, action.

38:15.249 --> 38:18.818
- It is.
- Count me in then.

38:18.905 --> 38:21.081
Hey, do you guys want
to get some beers?

38:21.168 --> 38:22.343
I'm buying.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.040
Well, in that case, absolutely.

38:24.127 --> 38:25.694
How about you, Megan?

38:25.781 --> 38:27.348
Call me Smitty.

38:27.435 --> 38:30.046
- Smitty.
- I'd love to.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.005
And Scott, I have to say,

38:32.092 --> 38:35.922
you seem unburdened
since I last saw you.

38:36.009 --> 38:40.013
Well, I got some clarity
since we worked together last.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.581
My mother, turns out she wasn't
who I thought she was.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.017
She was a hero.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.280
Not was, is,

38:46.367 --> 38:47.368
and she reached out again.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.152
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.459
- Where is she?

38:51.546 --> 38:52.591
That's a conversation
we'll have

38:52.678 --> 38:53.853
once I have a beer
in front of me.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.115
Come on.
