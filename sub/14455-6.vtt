00:11.933 --> 00:14.733
Narrator: Coming up,
what's got Q on the case?

00:14.733 --> 00:16.933
Are you here,
Secret Agent Randy Beans?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.833
Narrator: Why is Murr being
a grim reacher?

00:20.833 --> 00:22.967
The first breast I grabbed
was in a coffin.

00:24.633 --> 00:27.200
And which losing joker
will get a taste of defeat

00:27.200 --> 00:28.567
in tonight's punishment?

00:28.567 --> 00:30.133
Man: Aah!

00:30.133 --> 00:32.967
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.033
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.733 --> 00:37.367
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:39.167 --> 00:41.900
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:41.900 --> 00:43.933
Joe: Larry!

00:48.533 --> 00:50.833
We're back at it today,
working as a receptionist

00:50.833 --> 00:52.300
checking people
into their appointments.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.567
Cranges McBasketball.

00:53.567 --> 00:55.467
Except all the crazy names
we have to call out

00:55.467 --> 00:56.633
have been written
by the other guys.

00:56.633 --> 00:58.467
The goal is to read
these crazy names

00:58.467 --> 00:59.467
without laughing.

00:59.467 --> 01:01.600
Mr. or Mrs. McBasketball.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.800
Whoever laughs the least wins.

01:05.367 --> 01:06.400
Cranges.

01:11.067 --> 01:13.133
Murr: Joseph, that's
a sensible, nice blazer.

01:13.133 --> 01:15.167
-It doesn't fit me anymore.
-Can't tell from here.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.967
-You're looking good.
-That's 'cause I'm sitting down

01:16.967 --> 01:18.467
and I cut the back off it.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.367
Here we go.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.600
So, everybody's here
for focus groups, right?

01:22.600 --> 01:23.833
So, we're just gonna
call out some names.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.067
You hear your name,
just come up

01:25.067 --> 01:26.400
and then we'll send you
to the appropriate room.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.833
Glagadeen Capisce.

01:37.233 --> 01:42.433
Glagadeen Capisce.

01:44.433 --> 01:47.067
Minty Hummer.

01:47.067 --> 01:48.367
Who wrote Minty Hummer?

01:48.367 --> 01:50.700
Minty.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.233
No.

01:52.233 --> 01:53.967
Church Pewpewpew.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.600
Church Pewpewpew.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.733
Coolie Whistles.

02:04.067 --> 02:07.267
Coolie Whistles?

02:07.267 --> 02:08.767
Lumpy Dumper.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.633
Lumpy Dumper, no?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.067
It must be the 4:15.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.300
This is a mouthful, this one.

02:29.300 --> 02:33.067
Fidelroyolanda
Smackonmytiddyboosters III.

02:36.733 --> 02:38.433
Maybe the III is a typo.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.933
Fidelroyolanda
Smackonmytiddyboosters II?

02:49.100 --> 02:50.367
-That's a laugh!
-That's a laugh!

02:50.367 --> 02:53.100
-I don't care.
-Yeah, that's a laugh!

02:53.100 --> 02:54.333
Disfatt Bidge.

02:58.933 --> 03:00.400
Disfatt Bidge.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.500
Q: Here we go, here we go.
Here we go, here we go.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.100
Hold me up. Hold me up.
Hold me up.

03:15.567 --> 03:17.067
Uncle Boobs.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.200
Uncle Boobs.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.367
Joe: There he is,
hard at work.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.367
His computer screen's
not even on.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.967
Murr: You guys are all here
for the focus group?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.333
I'm just gonna go
through the names.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.667
If you're in the group,
come on up.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.633
Here we go.

03:45.067 --> 03:47.500
Ms. Doodat

03:47.500 --> 03:50.200
Diddy Doodat.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.233
No?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.133
Uh, Ms. McNamara?

03:55.133 --> 03:57.100
Is there a Cleavage McNamara.

03:59.767 --> 04:01.167
We got him.

04:01.167 --> 04:02.700
What the he-- none
of these names are right.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.300
Queen Skeet?

04:06.967 --> 04:10.233
They have the wrong group, here.

04:10.233 --> 04:13.167
Hey, Terrence, none of
these people are here.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.800
Is there a Yanni Van Halen?

04:16.167 --> 04:18.300
No?

04:20.367 --> 04:23.067
Is there
a Colonel Indiana Longnuts?

04:25.433 --> 04:26.600
Does anyone here
have the rank of colonel?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.667
Sir, Colonel Longnuts?

04:30.067 --> 04:32.133
None of these are right.

04:32.133 --> 04:34.067
Jabreakit

04:34.067 --> 04:36.467
Jabreakit Jubawdit?

04:36.467 --> 04:38.467
Is there a Jabreakit here?

04:38.467 --> 04:40.500
Jabreakit Jubawdit
It's not the right group.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.667
What? I don't get it.

04:42.667 --> 04:45.067
Gregory Poo--
Gregory Poopsicle.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.067
Gregory?

04:47.667 --> 04:48.600
Got him again!

04:48.600 --> 04:51.600
Gregory Poopsicle?
This is...

04:51.600 --> 04:53.733
Terrence, it's not
the right group.

04:57.833 --> 05:01.067
-Oh, here we go.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.300
Q: Just sit tight. When you hear
your name, just let me know.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.500
**

05:08.533 --> 05:10.133
Stunk Beagle?

05:12.533 --> 05:17.933
No? Okay.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.533
Irish O'African?

05:22.100 --> 05:24.667
Is there a Irish O'African?

05:30.600 --> 05:31.933
There it is!
Got him!

05:31.933 --> 05:34.500
Got a Cowabunga Peppermill?

05:36.833 --> 05:40.667
-No.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.933
Oh, Indian, yes.
Simmy Kantstandyourbitz Jr.

05:44.533 --> 05:47.833
Is there a
Simmy Kantstandyourbitz Jr.?

05:49.433 --> 05:51.300
Henny Cabbagehead. Henny?

05:53.067 --> 05:55.267
Henny Cabbagehead?

05:55.267 --> 05:57.433
Terrence,
the list that you gave me,

05:57.433 --> 05:59.300
is this for everybody,
or are we just --

05:59.300 --> 06:02.300
no, because they're
looking for a Guy Hutookatit.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.067
Guy?

06:06.633 --> 06:08.300
No, there's no Guy Hutookatit
up here.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.700
Got a

06:13.700 --> 06:15.100
Sharty Waffles?

06:16.633 --> 06:18.733
A Sharty Waffles? No.

06:18.733 --> 06:20.233
All right, let me just get
through these, I guess.

06:20.233 --> 06:23.300
We got

06:23.300 --> 06:25.067
That's another one!

06:25.067 --> 06:26.067
Secret

06:26.067 --> 06:27.633
Secret Agent Randy Beans.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.967
Are you here,
Secret Agent Randy Beans?

06:31.967 --> 06:33.200
Yeah, I guess you
wouldn't let me know

06:33.200 --> 06:34.900
if you were
Secret Agent Randy Beans.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.833
Imafraid Jumitebeeinnagang.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.367
Imafraid?
Imafraid Jumitebeeinnagang?

06:39.367 --> 06:42.100
Imafraid Jumitebeeinnagang?

06:45.500 --> 06:46.967
Joe: How'd he get
through that one?

06:46.967 --> 06:48.433
-Kenneth.

06:48.433 --> 06:49.667
Kenneth,
they're ready for you.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.867
Joe: And the man
who's the worst at this game

06:53.867 --> 06:55.067
out of anyone I know.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.067
Murr: Here we go.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.733
Are you using a stapler
as a mouse, you moron?

06:59.733 --> 07:01.067
You idiot!

07:01.067 --> 07:03.933
It's a stapler,
not a mouse.

07:03.933 --> 07:06.400
You are pretty,
but stupid.

07:10.067 --> 07:10.900
Got him.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.433
There he is.
There's one.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.567
Nabi Cankles?

07:16.167 --> 07:18.200
Nabi Cankles?
No, nobody?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.700
Not here.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.067
Reverend Donk Bonkers?

07:29.833 --> 07:31.533
There's -- I mean, you have
to e-mail me a new list.

07:31.533 --> 07:35.067
This is not --
next they want Real Hefty Trout.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.633
Is there a Real Hefty Trout?

07:41.967 --> 07:44.133
Eyeluvver Butterdogsheds?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.833
Eyeluvver?

07:47.833 --> 07:49.700
I don't know
what's going on here.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.700
Is there a Jerry Seinfeld?

07:53.333 --> 07:55.667
Is Jerry Seinfeld here?

07:57.200 --> 08:01.067
I was supposed to be in
at 2:45.

08:01.067 --> 08:04.067
Are you
Mark

08:10.233 --> 08:12.633
Wasda?

08:12.633 --> 08:14.667
Wasda Deelwifkramer?

08:18.433 --> 08:20.967
Yeah, I think you
gave me the 2:45 group.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.500
If you just e-mail it,
then I'll -- Yeah,

08:22.500 --> 08:24.067
because then I'll call
the 3:00 group.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.300
What are you,
going for an Oscar?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.767
Pacino, put the phone down.
Let's go.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.600
Okay. Hoo-ah.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.333
Joe: Yeah! Yeah!

08:37.333 --> 08:41.067
I mean, that's a laugh
if I ever saw one.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.933
Hufokkin Tonight?

08:44.967 --> 08:46.267
Is there a Tonight?
Mr. or Mrs. Tonight?

08:46.267 --> 08:48.400
Just raise your hand,
Hufokkin Tonight.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.533
That's a laugh.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.367
Mother...

09:00.533 --> 09:03.633
Joe: Take a breath,
that's right.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.800
-Say it!
-He's crying.

09:05.800 --> 09:10.833
-Open your stupid mouth...
-What is...

09:10.833 --> 09:14.600
You're literally
melting out there.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.067
Mother Coconuts?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.300
Mother Coconuts.

09:23.067 --> 09:26.200
"This...list...is...wrong.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.333
Sal."

09:29.233 --> 09:31.233
Narrator: This was no
laughing matter for Joe,

09:31.233 --> 09:34.467
so the other three jokers
are up on the loser board.

09:34.467 --> 09:36.067
Today, we're in the park
getting strangers

09:36.067 --> 09:38.467
to help us create
our online dating profile.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.867
The catch is,
what we're showing them

09:39.867 --> 09:41.167
has been created
by the other guys.

09:41.167 --> 09:42.600
Once we present the profiles,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.867
we'll ask them to rate them
on a scale from 1 to 10.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.367
Whoever gets
the lowest score loses,

09:46.367 --> 09:48.200
and I wore a pink shirt
today.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.400
I thought it was salmon.
Salmon.

09:53.433 --> 09:54.733
Q: Here he goes.

09:54.733 --> 09:56.067
Joe: It's a beautiful day
in the park

09:56.067 --> 09:57.433
to be working on
your dating profile.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.233
Murr really is
the only one who's online.

09:59.233 --> 10:00.967
Yeah, on online
dating services.

10:00.967 --> 10:04.200
He knows what it's like to
reach out, not get a reply.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.967
Hey
I hate to bug you.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.267
I need a woman's opinion.

10:11.267 --> 10:12.833
I'm filling out
a dating profile.

10:12.833 --> 10:15.300
Could you give me your honest
opinion of my answers?

10:15.300 --> 10:18.267
Okay, uh, just --
James, that's me.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.500
My self summary --

10:20.500 --> 10:23.133
"I ate a whole wet newspaper
for a TV talent show

10:23.133 --> 10:24.967
that never aired."

10:24.967 --> 10:26.333
So, I thought that would
be something

10:26.333 --> 10:27.267
cool and different
about me.

10:29.433 --> 10:30.700
Oh, it's no joke.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.067
Yeah, I didn't mean
it as a joke.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.033
I meant it seriously.
I'm actually pretty proud of it.

10:35.767 --> 10:38.433
"On a typical
Friday night, I am..."

10:38.433 --> 10:40.633
I wrote "eating ribs
in the tub, baby,

10:40.633 --> 10:41.733
and there's room
for one more."

10:44.200 --> 10:47.333
I was trying to be a little
flirty, there, you know?

10:47.333 --> 10:49.467
It's cute.

10:49.467 --> 10:50.933
She is done giving
real feedback.

10:50.933 --> 10:52.833
"The most private thing
I'm willing to admit" --

10:52.833 --> 10:55.200
"The first breast I grabbed
was in a coffin."

10:56.700 --> 10:58.567
My grandmother,
when she passed away,

10:58.567 --> 11:00.600
I reached out
and I touched her boob.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.733
Sal, Q, and Joe: Ohh!

11:01.733 --> 11:05.233
That's not written.
That part's not written.

11:05.233 --> 11:07.667
You think it's too much?

11:09.433 --> 11:11.633
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how datable am I?

11:11.633 --> 11:13.067
Probably an 11.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.367
11?
Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

11:14.367 --> 11:15.500
Why do you say that?

11:16.567 --> 11:17.933
All right.

11:19.533 --> 11:20.767
Do you girls want to
help a fella out

11:20.767 --> 11:22.967
with his dating profile app?

11:22.967 --> 11:25.067
Yeah? Yeah, it's quick.

11:25.067 --> 11:26.367
It's asking me
for my self summary.

11:26.367 --> 11:28.467
It says, "They removed
a lump from me

11:28.467 --> 11:30.167
and now everything flows
where it should."

11:31.500 --> 11:36.067
I'm also a diehard
Yankee fan.

11:36.067 --> 11:37.300
Flip it? Flip it.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.133
Flip it, yeah.
Flip it. Flip it.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.500
On a typical Friday night,

11:40.500 --> 11:44.167
I am playing at Skank Row
with my band the Fart Trio.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.667
I'm on drums.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.333
So I'm musical,
so I guess that's nice.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.600
Girls like that?

11:52.367 --> 11:55.133
The most private thing
I'm willing to admit --

11:55.133 --> 11:57.067
I left a man for dead
in a cave once.

11:58.167 --> 12:01.900
There was, uh,
a spelunking situation.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.133
I'm really good at --
I can tell if any person

12:08.133 --> 12:10.167
is an Asian woman
from behind.

12:11.333 --> 12:12.433
No?

12:12.433 --> 12:14.333
And the last one
I have here is it says,

12:14.333 --> 12:17.100
"What would you do with an
unexpected bonus from your job?"

12:17.100 --> 12:19.667
And I wrote,
"Go ape at Lids."

12:23.767 --> 12:25.567
The hat store!

12:25.567 --> 12:26.833
I try to budget myself,

12:26.833 --> 12:28.667
but I would just
straight

12:30.133 --> 12:31.867
He's not even
wearing a hat now.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.133
He never wears hats.

12:33.133 --> 12:35.267
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how datable do you think I'd be?

12:39.067 --> 12:40.333
Oh, she's Asian.

12:42.533 --> 12:44.800
Just give me a number.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.300
-Ohh!
-5. 5.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.767
I got some work to do,
though, clearly, right?

12:49.967 --> 12:51.200
Okay.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.567
Excuse me. I'm trying to
fill out a dating profile.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.567
Yeah?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.233
And I would love
a female perspective

12:58.233 --> 12:59.267
on some of answers.

12:59.267 --> 13:00.233
Yeah?

13:00.233 --> 13:01.467
Joe: Here we go.

13:01.467 --> 13:04.133
The first thing
that people notice about me

13:04.133 --> 13:06.200
is my dead eyes.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.667
I hear that a lot.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.300
What I'm doing with my life --
I make teeth for things.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.867
Teeth, yeah.
It's like taxidermy.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.667
Like when they stuff
a giraffe or something,

13:18.667 --> 13:20.167
I put dentures in.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.433
Ah, okay.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.467
Only teeth, though.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.700
Uh, the most private thing
I'm willing to admit...

13:29.067 --> 13:30.767
Every other Sunday,
I drive upstate

13:30.767 --> 13:33.233
and leave tuna
in my ex's mailbox.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.867
Tuna?

13:34.867 --> 13:37.767
'Cause it stinks.
And so does she.

13:37.767 --> 13:39.767
It is a little too honest.

13:39.767 --> 13:41.333
A little too honest?

13:41.333 --> 13:46.067
My life motto is, uh,
"Cowabunga, sluts."

13:48.333 --> 13:49.300
I think that's good.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.300
That's okay?
Oh, great, perfect.

13:51.433 --> 13:54.600
On a scale from 1 to 10,
how datable is this guy?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.133
Like a 5?
A 5?

13:56.133 --> 13:58.667
-5! All right!
-Okay, all right.

13:58.667 --> 13:59.833
I can deal with that.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.500
Excuse me.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.800
I'm making this
online dating profile.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.933
Yeah?

14:05.933 --> 14:07.067
I was wondering maybe
if I could like

14:07.067 --> 14:08.567
run some of my answers by you.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.167
-Yeah, sure.
-Here we go.

14:10.167 --> 14:12.133
All right, favorite books,
movies, shows, music,

14:12.133 --> 14:13.200
and food --

14:13.200 --> 14:15.500
"Pizza, obviously,
you stupid idiot."

14:17.167 --> 14:18.333
Too much humor?

14:18.333 --> 14:19.933
It's just not funny.

14:19.933 --> 14:20.900
Okay.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.833
What I'm doing with my
life -- uh,

14:22.833 --> 14:23.767
"Beating women...

14:23.767 --> 14:25.667
away with a stick, LOL."

14:28.933 --> 14:31.300
Why don't I just get rid
of the dot, dot, dot,

14:31.300 --> 14:33.667
and I just put one full thought
and not make it a joke --

14:33.667 --> 14:34.833
"Beating women away
with a stick,"

14:34.833 --> 14:37.133
so they know I'm
a ladies' man.

14:38.733 --> 14:40.667
"What would you do with
an unexpected bonus?"

14:40.667 --> 14:42.733
"Give it to a church --
not.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.900
Atlantic City
with my goon squad."

14:47.600 --> 14:49.500
This is bad?

14:49.500 --> 14:51.600
On a scale of like 1 to 10,

14:51.600 --> 14:53.567
how datable do you
think this is?

14:53.567 --> 14:55.600
Kind of a weird dude.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.533
We're safe.
We're safe!

15:01.533 --> 15:02.800
Murr: Negative 2?

15:02.800 --> 15:05.100
Narrator:
Sal was a hopeless romantic,

15:05.100 --> 15:07.367
making him tonight's big loser.

15:07.367 --> 15:11.500
-Hey! Sal is our big loser.
-Yet again.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.367
So, we're here
at the Boat Show

15:13.367 --> 15:15.700
in the largest convention center
in New York City.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.067
What do I got to do?
Destroy a boat?

15:17.067 --> 15:19.800
No.
Rub people's feet.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.067
They've been walking up
and down the aisles,

15:22.067 --> 15:24.133
oh, so much,
their feet are weary.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.067
-Their dogs are barking.
-Oh, I don't touch feet.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.500
This is not gonna
bode well for anyone.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.600
You have problems
rubbing your own feet.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.067
I might throw up
on someone's foot.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.667
Yeah, that's okay.
Just work it into it, though.

15:35.767 --> 15:38.667
Guys, there's a punishment
afoot. Oh, God.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.800
Joe: All right, Sal, let's give
some people some foot rubs.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.500
Q: Get your foot rubs here.
Get your foot rubs.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.300
Okay. Ahh.
Ahh.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.333
Oh, great.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.300
Oh.

15:50.567 --> 15:52.567
Already.
Already, look at him.

15:52.567 --> 15:56.100
-Get in there, buddy!

15:56.100 --> 15:58.067
Hm.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.800
-I'm not breathing.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.067
-All right.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.067
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.900
-Have a great day.
-One down, Sal.

16:11.233 --> 16:13.367
Joe: Look at him just
looking at his hands.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.133
I got to clean my hands.

16:16.133 --> 16:18.733
No, no, no, there's no
cleaning of your hands.

16:18.733 --> 16:21.133
No cleaning.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.167
You like a firm pressure?

16:22.167 --> 16:23.067
Yeah.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.500
Sure, sure.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.233
Ooh, yeah. Yeah.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.600
Sal, just drop a,
"You like that?"

16:37.100 --> 16:38.200
Oh, yeah.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.133
Say it!

16:40.133 --> 16:42.133
-Oh, yeah.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.667
Mmm!

16:45.667 --> 16:47.833
"I'm a straight-up
bad boy."

16:47.833 --> 16:49.067
-Ahh.
-No. I'm not gonna --

16:49.067 --> 16:51.933
You have to!
It's a punishment. Say it!

16:53.200 --> 16:54.833
I'm a straight-up...

16:54.833 --> 16:57.333
What

16:57.333 --> 16:59.067
-You said something.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.433
I'm a straight-up bad boy.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.067
You're a bad boy?

17:03.133 --> 17:05.467
Ah, well,
just call me Nasty.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.967
-It was a pleasure to meet you.
-Oh, thanks so much.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.067
I hope you have
a great day, dear.

17:11.067 --> 17:13.533
Nice try, guys.
Nice try.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.400
Oh, yeah, she was
a friend of ours.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.533
Nice try
You still had to rub her feet.

17:18.533 --> 17:19.933
Ugh.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.533
-Yeah.

17:25.533 --> 17:26.667
Yeah.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.800
Look under the purple towel
on the rack.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.700
-It's ranch dressing.

17:32.833 --> 17:34.500
Take out the ranch dressing
and just squeeze it

17:34.500 --> 17:37.067
and slap it on.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.200
Joe:
Okay, so Sal's onto us.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.300
He knows that some of
these people we invited here.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.967
-Oh, sure.
-Hey, Sal, by the way,

17:47.967 --> 17:49.233
this isn't our lady.

17:50.733 --> 17:51.967
Sal, this isn't our lady.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.800
Murr: You're rubbing ranch
dressing on a stranger.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.167
I can't even believe, you know,
what's happening here.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.833
Sal, go, "Surprise,
I used ranch dressing."

18:06.567 --> 18:09.067
Surprise.

18:09.067 --> 18:12.067
It's actually ranch dressing.

18:12.067 --> 18:13.767
You know, it exfoliates.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.333
-You're all set, dear.
-Thank you.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.300
I can't even smell my hand.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.867
My hand smells
like  ranch.

18:27.133 --> 18:28.333
Joe: Another friend of ours

18:28.333 --> 18:31.900
who has what you would call
jacked-up feet.

18:33.433 --> 18:36.667
I'll use a lotion
if you don't care.

18:41.067 --> 18:43.700
It looks like
"American Werewolf in London"

18:43.700 --> 18:44.900
mid-transformation.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.300
Just I have, uh...

18:47.300 --> 18:49.867
I'll put some
powder there for you.

18:49.867 --> 18:53.200
Oh, my God.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.767
Oh, my God.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.133
Oh!

18:59.600 --> 19:02.100
Are you a mayo
or mustard guy?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.867
Uh, mayo or mustard
on your sandwich usually?

19:04.867 --> 19:06.067
Mayo.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.700
You know, a surprising fact
about mayo.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.067
Do you know
a surprising fact about mayo?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.533
I have some right here, and
I'm gonna rub your feet with it.

19:13.533 --> 19:16.967
I have mayo.
I usually use it on people.

19:16.967 --> 19:19.633
-Wow.
-Let me get the mayo.

19:19.633 --> 19:23.067
I'm starting to feel,
like, nauseous.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.100
Oh, God!

19:27.900 --> 19:31.267
Oh, my -- Ohh.
No.

19:31.267 --> 19:32.967
I can't. Oh.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.267
Murr: Ew!

19:34.267 --> 19:36.167
-I can't --
-Oh, God, this is bad.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.667
Why would we make ourselves
watch this?

19:40.067 --> 19:41.567
I'm sorry.
This has got to be you.

19:41.567 --> 19:44.233
you -- you --
They sent you here?

19:44.233 --> 19:46.967
Are you part of it?

19:48.100 --> 19:52.233
Are you part of the --
You're part of the show?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.567
Yeah, this guy's
a friend of ours.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.767
Nobody has feet like this
just by nature.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.067
They told me
you're on the show.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.633
You've got to get
your foot off me, please.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.733
-Time for your lunch break.
-You got a delivery, Sal.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.100
Your punishment ends
when you eat a rib.
Enjoy your rib.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.500
-Don't clean your hands off.
rib.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.300
-Yes, you are.
-Take a bite.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.567
-Take a bite.
-I can't.

20:08.567 --> 20:11.100
They smell terrible.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.167
it.

20:15.167 --> 20:17.033
-Eww!
-Eww!

20:17.033 --> 20:18.233
I'm gonna throw up.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.133
-That's it, buddy.
-You're done!

20:20.133 --> 20:21.567
You're all done, pal.

20:21.567 --> 20:23.233
you
and your big-ass feet.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.833
**

20:29.833 --> 20:32.367
Sal just got defeated
in tonight's punishment.

20:32.367 --> 20:34.033
We're gonna give you
a behind-the-scenes look

20:34.033 --> 20:35.667
of how it happened
and give you bonus footage

20:35.667 --> 20:36.867
from tonight's episode.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.033
Check this out.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.500
This is where the jokers
are behind the scenes,

20:40.500 --> 20:43.267
and this is how far it
is to the massage chair.

20:50.867 --> 20:54.167
And here we are. This is where
Sal was massaging feet.

20:54.167 --> 20:58.100
In here, we have cameras.
Check this out.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.067
I can't even smell my hand.

21:00.067 --> 21:03.633
My hand smells
like  ranch.

21:03.633 --> 21:06.167
Joe: And he can't do
anything about it.

21:06.167 --> 21:08.867
Sal's about to find out
in this intro

21:08.867 --> 21:11.567
we're shooting right here
what he has to do.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.567
Three, two, one.

21:13.567 --> 21:16.867
Hey, Sal is our big loser.

21:16.867 --> 21:18.067
Oh, I don't touch feet.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.467
This is not gonna
bode well for anyone.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.267
You have problems
rubbing your own feet.

21:21.267 --> 21:23.567
I rub my feet.
Don't say that.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.400
I get out of the shower --
I put on antiperspirant

21:26.400 --> 21:27.467
on my feet even.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.067
-That's how thorough I am.

21:29.067 --> 21:30.567
-Yeah, I spray --
-No one cares.

21:30.567 --> 21:31.767
You know who doesn't do that?

21:31.767 --> 21:34.767
The 10,000 people walking
around this boat show.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.533
This is my shirt
for anti-bullying.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.233
-Very cool.
-Be nice to people.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.500
Don't be a bully.
Back the  up.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.233
Don't do stuff like that.
That's not nice. Hugs.

21:44.233 --> 21:45.167
Oh, he did it
as an example.

21:45.167 --> 21:46.567
Nice.
Got it.

21:46.567 --> 21:48.367
Do hugs.
You have a soft face.

21:48.367 --> 21:50.533
I do, don't I?
Isn't that crazy.

21:50.533 --> 21:51.733
It's crazy.

21:51.733 --> 21:53.467
Take out the ranch dressing
and just squeeze it

21:53.467 --> 21:55.133
and slap it on.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.533
Sal,
what does it smell like?

22:01.533 --> 22:03.933
Uh, like ranch.

22:05.333 --> 22:06.433
You just signed a release.

22:06.433 --> 22:07.700
You know that you
were on camera.
