01:47.650 --> 01:48.359
Hello my lovelies.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.649
This is an exciting night.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.403
Faith Winters is about to exit.

01:51.654 --> 01:53.494
I know that you can't
wait for the information,

01:53.739 --> 01:56.242
and we're almost gonna
give it to you, but,

01:56.492 --> 01:58.744
my lips are sealed until
you hear from Faith herself.

01:58.994 --> 01:59.994
So hang in there.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.580
Five, four, three,

02:02.915 --> 02:04.416
maybe two?

02:04.667 --> 02:06.645
All right guys, all right
guys, that's enough joking.

02:06.669 --> 02:07.669
But here.

02:07.837 --> 02:08.836
She's almost in here.

02:11.715 --> 02:12.715
Hey guys.

02:12.842 --> 02:13.926
Faith here.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.553
I'm gonna tell you
a little story.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.139
I remember this night
like it was yesterday.

02:18.389 --> 02:21.684
I mean, the cameras,
the fans, the lights,

02:21.934 --> 02:23.727
the energy on stage.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.271
It was awesome.

02:26.564 --> 02:29.024
I mean to everybody
else, I had it all.

02:29.275 --> 02:32.820
But, deep down, there
was somethin' missin'.

02:34.697 --> 02:38.242
Lookin' back now I know
that I just wasn't happy.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.661
Miss Winters and I are
working on our next tour now.

02:40.911 --> 02:44.582
We will announce dates,
venues, as soon as we can.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.832
Thank you.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.506
Amazing show again
tonight, Faith.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.300
Oh, thanks Randy.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.635
Would you like to meet
two of your number one fans?

02:56.886 --> 02:58.012
Well of course.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.638
Well come on in ladies.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.643
Hey, now, I saw
y'all in the hallway.

03:04.894 --> 03:05.644
Hi.

03:05.895 --> 03:07.021
Hey.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.565
All Abigail talks about
is meeting you one day.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.027
We both saw your speech at
the National Girl's Ministry

03:13.277 --> 03:15.946
and, well, you're her hero.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.948
You're also my hero.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.783
That's so sweet.

03:21.035 --> 03:25.039
Well, I don't have any pictures
to sign for you, but, um,

03:25.289 --> 03:26.290
do you like daisies?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.750
They're my favorite.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.251
They're mine, too.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.979
You know what's really
cool about daisies?

03:31.003 --> 03:32.046
What?

03:32.296 --> 03:33.356
They look like
they're one flower

03:33.380 --> 03:35.424
but they're actually two.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.093
Thank you.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.944
We should probably
get back going though.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.889
Our mom is waiting
for us in the car.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.058
Oh, then you better get goin'.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.869
You know what I learned
when I was out on the road?

03:45.893 --> 03:46.560
What?

03:46.810 --> 03:49.146
You'll always need your momma.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.522
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.125
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Miss Winters.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.149
Bye.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.611
Oh my god, we got to meet her.

03:55.861 --> 03:56.861
Well.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.571
You did it.

03:57.821 --> 03:58.572
Another one in the books.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.532
Hey now Randy, we did it.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.623
I'm gonna get my street
clothes on and gonna go

04:02.826 --> 04:04.546
hang with some friends,
so, I guess I'll see

04:04.787 --> 04:05.787
you tomorrow.

04:26.392 --> 04:30.938
Better luck next time, mate.

04:32.106 --> 04:32.773
Killin' up there Jay.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.358
We're doin' it tonight Luke.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.461
I appreciate it. Hey, mix me
up somethin' if you don't mind.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.027
Yeah, what you want?

04:37.278 --> 04:37.861
Usual appletini?

04:38.112 --> 04:38.654
Ha.

04:38.904 --> 04:39.904
Yeah.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.947
Well, you know my usual.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.533
Yeah, Jack and
coke, I got you buddy.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.660
I appreciate it, man.

04:45.828 --> 04:46.828
Howdy ma'am.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.540
Hey.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.209
Do I know you?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.128
That's the line
you're gonna use?

04:54.378 --> 04:55.045
Well I aint lyin'.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.756
You look, you look familiar.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.883
I don't know what to tell ya.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.635
Hey, Vanessa is gonna kill me,

05:01.885 --> 05:04.013
and if she doesn't, Faith will.

05:04.263 --> 05:08.058
Wherever you are, Cam,
just get here, like now.

05:09.685 --> 05:10.978
You come in here a lot?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.747
Man you're really pullin'
out all the classics

05:12.771 --> 05:13.897
tonight aint ya?

05:15.024 --> 05:16.024
What's next?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.776
"Did you fall from Heaven?"

05:20.112 --> 05:21.238
I don't know.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.008
If I'd of known that one,
I'd have used that one,

05:23.032 --> 05:25.409
but you look like you
could've fallen from Heaven.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.745
Are you just an open
mic addict like myself?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.395
You know, I got a
record coming out.

05:29.621 --> 05:30.998
Oh, I heard.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.916
Just trying to be nice.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.627
Guys like you are never
just trying to be nice.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.088
You don't know the
first thing about me.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.467
Everything okay here?

05:41.717 --> 05:43.278
I'm good. But your
little old friend there,

05:43.302 --> 05:44.887
she aint being very nice.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.722
Come on Faith, let's go.

05:46.972 --> 05:47.972
Faith?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.100
Faith Winters.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.564
Faith Winters everybody.

05:57.816 --> 05:58.567
Faith what is going on?

05:58.817 --> 05:59.817
Get her out of here.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.070
Put all the cameras down.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.615
You'll be buyin' new
ones if you don't.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.663
What the?

06:14.083 --> 06:15.083
What's this?

06:15.292 --> 06:16.436
Your little episode last night?

06:16.460 --> 06:19.713
All over the tabloids
this mornin'.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.340
Who cares?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.884
I didn't do anything wrong.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.470
Man, I'm just tired, Vanessa.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.014
These 14 hour days
are killin' me.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.034
Please promise me you'll
work in some off days

06:31.058 --> 06:32.434
on this next tour.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.844
Yeah, I'll just work 'em
in, I'll just pencil 'em in.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.020
What about me?

06:36.146 --> 06:38.315
I don't know, hazard pay?

06:42.403 --> 06:42.945
Yeah.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.571
That's just print.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.508
Please don't turn on the TV,
it's even worse in motion.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.157
But don't worry.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.784
I'll handle it.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.034
Handle what, V?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.787
I'm tellin' you, it
was not that bad.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.580
Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't so bad.

06:53.831 --> 06:54.957
Okay, now listen.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.018
You know that high school
you have a lot of money to?

06:57.042 --> 06:58.794
They're namin' an
auditorium after you.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.963
So I need you to
shower, get dressed,

07:01.213 --> 07:02.339
and paint the barn.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.425
- That's today?
- That's today.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.386
Limo, red carpet, abbreviated
set pictures with kids,

07:07.636 --> 07:10.347
back in the car,
home, and to bed.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.597
Knock wood.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.726
It's gonna be fine.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.312
Paint the barn.

07:20.357 --> 07:24.778
Just because you throw it
away doesn't make it go away.

07:34.413 --> 07:35.789
Hey baby.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.416
How you feelin'?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.585
I'm fine.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.379
Come here and take a load off.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.124
Look last night didn't end
quite the way I had hoped,

07:46.300 --> 07:49.011
and this morning hasn't
been much better.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.388
But I got it all under control.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.973
Stop stressin' me.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.224
Okay.

07:55.893 --> 07:56.894
What are you watchin'>

07:57.144 --> 08:00.898
Our very own sweet,
Southern, spiritual songstress

08:01.148 --> 08:03.317
from Smithville is
spiraling seriously

08:03.567 --> 08:04.985
out of control.

08:05.235 --> 08:09.114
By now you know, it's none
other than Faith Winters.

08:09.364 --> 08:09.907
Mhm.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.241
Are you?

08:11.492 --> 08:12.534
Are you kiddin' me>

08:12.784 --> 08:13.452
- Listen, listen, listen...
- What?

08:13.702 --> 08:14.703
Listen, listen, listen.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.264
I knew that was gonna
be your reaction.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.348
I knew that was gonna be
your reaction and baby,

08:17.372 --> 08:18.916
take a deep breath.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.209
It's all good.

08:20.459 --> 08:21.877
It's actually a
good thing for us.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.127
Mm mm.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.297
I spoke to somebody
this morning.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.382
Remember Seth Ingram>

08:27.633 --> 08:29.009
At Clearwater>

08:29.259 --> 08:30.677
That's right,
Clearwater Records.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.388
Yeah, he's a known slimeball.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.807
Okay, no, what he's known as,

08:36.058 --> 08:37.934
is head of the hottest
record label in town.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.895
Yeah, but how many
bodies did he have to

08:40.145 --> 08:41.522
step over in order to get there>

08:41.772 --> 08:42.981
Okay, just listen to me.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.459
I know you have an
opinion about him,

08:44.483 --> 08:46.902
but throw that away
and hear me out.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.278
He's got a great idea.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.697
We can use this publicity
to our advantage, baby.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.617
Think about what's going on
recently in the industry.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.995
Nashville is full of good
girls, up and down the block,

08:57.246 --> 08:58.914
that are not making it.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.251
The fans are buying the
bad girls right now.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.421
They want that crazy
neighbor that will burn down

09:04.461 --> 09:07.756
the neighborhood, and
sing about the flames.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.217
Sweetie, look at society.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.220
People are angry,
they're frustrated,

09:13.470 --> 09:16.890
and they need somebody to be
a voice of their frustrations.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.392
Faith, that can be you.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.228
No, it aint gonna be me.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.854
Does Vanessa know about this?

09:23.105 --> 09:26.858
Listen, I know you and
Vanessa are good friends.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.736
And it's fine, but
babe, I'm your manager.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.197
I've been doin'
this a long time.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.116
And if we're gonna
get over this hump,

09:34.366 --> 09:36.135
that we've been fightin'
for the last couple years,

09:36.159 --> 09:39.496
you're gonna have to kick
this goody two shoes act.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.746
Act>

09:44.084 --> 09:46.878
I know you're frustrated,
but listen to me.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.465
Every career of every
artist has chapters.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.052
This is your next one.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.345
Okay>

09:55.596 --> 09:58.056
Now go downstairs and
make us some coffee.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.350
You finish gettin' ready.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.020
It's all good.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.284
Okay.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.636
Let's go over this
one more time.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.287
I like the cheese fries there.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.748
Someone might've slipped
somethin' into my drink.

10:22.998 --> 10:26.251
The lesson here is, never
let yourself become a victim.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.101
Now let's talk about
why I'm really here.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.337
Yes.

10:29.379 --> 10:29.921
That's it.

10:30.172 --> 10:30.714
Perfect.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.964
Okay you got that?

10:32.174 --> 10:32.841
Got it.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.134
Show time.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.385
Let's go.

10:36.970 --> 10:37.970
Hey.

10:38.597 --> 10:39.640
You got this.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.354
Faith.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.146
Hey y'all.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.439
Hi.

10:47.689 --> 10:48.916
Soozie from IT TV,
do you have a minute?

10:48.940 --> 10:50.025
Yeah.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.194
Awesome, so what really
happened last night?

10:52.444 --> 10:53.487
Well.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.337
I like the cheese
fries there, and, uh...

10:55.572 --> 10:58.033
So the cheese fries
got you intoxicated?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.785
Thank you, thank you so much.

11:00.035 --> 11:00.577
Thank you.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.370
Listen Faith.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.746
Thank you.

11:02.996 --> 11:03.538
Is it true that you knocked down

11:03.789 --> 11:04.498
a drink or two, Faith?

11:04.748 --> 11:05.415
I know you called Ingram.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.000
I did.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.311
Okay, listen, you know,
I know your fans will

11:08.335 --> 11:10.587
forgive if you just
give us the truth.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.117
Hey, I really like that blouse.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.174
Where'd you get that>

11:14.424 --> 11:15.424
Listen.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.677
We can fix this, okay?

11:16.927 --> 11:17.594
Faith's one of the good guys.

11:17.844 --> 11:18.887
Look at where we are.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.457
We are at a high
school auditorium

11:20.681 --> 11:22.307
with teenagers
and their parents.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.017
You listen to me.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.727
Our record sales are dropping.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.288
Last night is the first
time that Faith's trended

11:27.312 --> 11:28.897
since her first album.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.273
Her first.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.001
I bought out everything
I could to get this

11:32.025 --> 11:33.193
televised today.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.238
Now if all we do is
simply repair her image,

11:36.488 --> 11:38.049
you and I will be in
the unemployment line

11:38.073 --> 11:39.741
before the CMAs.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.869
Cameron, this is more
than just a job for me.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.472
I promised her daddy
before he died that I would

11:44.496 --> 11:45.580
take care of her.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.290
You are taking care of her.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.042
Bert didn't want her to starve.

11:49.292 --> 11:53.046
So do us both a favor
and stay in your line.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.337
Well aint you a
sight, Pastor Gavin.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.130
Am I?

12:35.380 --> 12:37.215
I wouldn't know.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.466
Cute.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.011
Hey, you seen Zoe today>

12:41.261 --> 12:43.138
Said she was goin'
to the dance studio.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.016
You know, if I can get
her to focus on her homework

12:46.266 --> 12:47.326
the way she focuses
on her dancin',

12:47.350 --> 12:48.750
I might be considered
for sainthood.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.104
Well, we all have our loves.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.439
Vices, too.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.411
You've been practicing.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.913
Miss Sharp.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.915
I didn't realize
anyone was here.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.375
Well I didn't wanna interrupt.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.628
Did you make up that
dance all by yourself?

13:14.878 --> 13:15.879
Yeah.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.216
It's really impressive, Zoe.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.026
I see you're listenin'
to Faith Winters.

13:21.051 --> 13:21.760
You a fan?

13:22.010 --> 13:24.262
Yeah, she's all right.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.223
She's got a pretty voice.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.015
You>

13:27.265 --> 13:28.266
Me?

13:28.517 --> 13:29.810
Oh, I'm a big fan.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.978
Not as big as your daddy though.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.688
Why's that?

13:33.939 --> 13:36.191
Wait, he hasn't told you>

13:37.609 --> 13:39.420
You know, why don't you,
um, I think you should

13:39.444 --> 13:41.112
ask him about that.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.824
Yeah, I would love to
hear what he has to say.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.242
Okay.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.911
Speaking of your daddy, um,
I think he's looking for you.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.081
Why don't you get your
stuff and we can head over

13:50.205 --> 13:50.872
to the church.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.402
I'd like to tell him good night.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.794
Okay then.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.170
Any calls?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.881
You sure you wanna know>

14:00.131 --> 14:01.131
We behind again>

14:06.388 --> 14:07.388
Here.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.787
I thought we were caught
up with the electric company?

14:12.811 --> 14:13.562
Uh, we were.

14:13.812 --> 14:14.812
In March.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.566
All right.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.210
I'll take care of
it this afternoon.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.234
Anything else?

14:20.443 --> 14:21.444
Sarah Miller called.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.713
She wants to rent the fellowship
hall on Thursday nights

14:22.737 --> 14:24.030
for a book club.

14:24.281 --> 14:24.823
Rent?

14:25.073 --> 14:26.283
Yeah.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.885
She has fair use
of that space just

14:27.909 --> 14:29.369
like everyone else, Amy.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.704
Gavin.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.598
Now I know it's been a
while since my comm degree

14:32.622 --> 14:34.249
did any real good,

14:34.499 --> 14:35.939
but I do remember
a couple of things,

14:36.167 --> 14:37.887
and one of 'em's you
need to have more money

14:38.086 --> 14:39.726
comin' in than goin'
out if you wanna keep

14:39.880 --> 14:41.256
these doors open.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.817
And I haven't even
started goin' through all

14:42.841 --> 14:44.009
the other bills.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.469
Now, if you want me
to be quiet, I will.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.656
But sooner or later, we
are going to have to start

14:48.680 --> 14:50.599
chargin' for use of
the fellowship hall.

14:50.849 --> 14:51.849
No.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.453
No, Amy, we're not gonna
start chargin' our members

14:54.477 --> 14:55.854
to use this place, all right>

14:56.104 --> 14:57.272
It's theirs.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.399
Then how do you
suggest we pay the bills?

14:59.649 --> 15:00.650
Hm>

15:02.277 --> 15:03.486
God'll provide.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.615
God'll provide.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.075
All right.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.914
You just got to have faith.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.126
There she is.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.376
Hi, beautiful.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.502
Hey.

15:20.670 --> 15:21.670
You ready to celebrate>

15:21.713 --> 15:22.797
Celebrate what?

15:23.048 --> 15:24.808
How many people you
know have a high school

15:24.883 --> 15:27.344
auditorium named
after them, huh?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.346
So loosen up,
let's have a drink.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.263
Where's Vanessa?

15:30.513 --> 15:31.848
I'm sure she'll turn up.

15:32.098 --> 15:35.810
But first, I wanna
introduce you to Seth Ingram

15:36.061 --> 15:37.562
from Clearwater Records.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.356
Faith Winters.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.900
It is a pleasure to
finally meet you.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.790
I feel like our paths
are always crossing,

15:43.818 --> 15:44.361
yet we never...

15:44.611 --> 15:46.154
Somehow we never meet.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.530
Exactly.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.449
Funny how that works.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.743
Well, the good news is,
now there's no excuse.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.262
So why don't you
two grab a drink

15:53.286 --> 15:54.996
and step outside and
maybe have a talk?

15:55.246 --> 15:57.415
We have something to talk about.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.417
Here you go.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.388
Listen, I wanna listen
to your demos, honey.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.047
Come into my office and play
it for me in person, will ya?

16:04.297 --> 16:05.548
Let's go this way.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.605
Pretty night.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.566
Is that a question,
or a statement?

16:25.235 --> 16:27.570
One thing you learn
about me is that I never

16:27.821 --> 16:31.783
ask questions that I don't
already know the answer to.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.203
To the next megastar
of country music.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.915
Oh come on now, Don,
don't leave me hangin'.

16:40.792 --> 16:41.792
To you.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.142
Did you get your homework done?

16:57.392 --> 16:57.934
Not yet.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.436
Zoe.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.228
We talked about this.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.688
Miss Sharp is concerned.

17:01.938 --> 17:02.938
With who?

17:03.148 --> 17:04.147
Me?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.315
Or you?

17:05.858 --> 17:06.943
Just do your homework.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.569
- I will.
- As soon as we get home.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.819
I will.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.407
Dad!

17:13.657 --> 17:14.867
I am trying to send a text.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.454
And I'm trying to have
a conversation with you.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.704
Gosh.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.550
What do you know about her?

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
Faith Winters?

17:35.930 --> 17:37.474
Are you okay?

17:37.724 --> 17:38.724
You know,

17:40.101 --> 17:41.941
you can just say "Pump
the brakes" if you don't

17:41.978 --> 17:43.480
wanna talk about something.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.816
You don't actually
have to pump them.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.157
We dated in high school.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.618
So.

17:56.868 --> 17:57.535
Thanks, Miranda.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.413
No problem, Pastor Gavin.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.500
So tell me, any life
changing messages on tap

18:03.750 --> 18:05.710
for tomorrow's sermon?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.588
You'll just have to show up
and find out, I guess, huh?

18:08.838 --> 18:09.506
Guess so, I'll be there.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.757
Right.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.538
Your notebook's
seen better days.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.676
What's in it?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.554
My homework, dad.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.515
All right.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.600
I'll stop pryin'.

18:20.850 --> 18:21.518
Where was I?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.603
You dated Faith Winters.

18:23.853 --> 18:24.854
Right.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.609
Back then, she
wasn't Faith Winters.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.610
She was just Faith.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.446
Did you love her?

18:34.697 --> 18:37.617
The Lord commands
we love everyone.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.870
I'm not talking
to Pastor Whitfield.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.789
I'm talking to my dad.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.833
That was a long time ago.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.628
Speaking of time, I got a
sermon to write tonight.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.381
What do you say we put
our boots in the dust?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.631
Thank you.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.180
Listen, Mr. Ingram, pardon
my ignorance, but, um...

18:59.430 --> 19:02.642
Ah ah ah, you see
a mister around here?

19:02.892 --> 19:03.892
My name is Seth.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.061
Seth.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.747
Well listen, I don't
really want a whole lot

19:06.771 --> 19:07.897
out of life.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.525
I just wanna keep sharin'
my music with the world,

19:10.775 --> 19:12.152
and hopefully touch a few lives.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.612
What was that first part>

19:14.863 --> 19:15.863
Share my music.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.532
With the what?

19:17.782 --> 19:18.491
With the world.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.034
With the world.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.537
You know what you just told me?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.205
You want the world.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.750
And if that's what
you want, Faith,

19:28.001 --> 19:30.503
that is gonna cost
you as an artist.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.798
Now that last record,
I mean, it was,

19:34.883 --> 19:36.551
I mean sure, it was safe.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.511
Actually no, you know what>

19:38.761 --> 19:39.762
It was worse than that.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.890
It was ordinary, especially
coming from someone

19:42.140 --> 19:44.809
who's got as much
to give as you.

19:46.352 --> 19:50.899
And that is why I am offering
you a deal at Clearwater.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.961
Did Cameron put you up to this?

19:53.985 --> 19:55.504
Would that make it
easier for you to hear>

19:55.528 --> 19:59.240
If you knew that you had
a traitor in the camp>

19:59.490 --> 20:03.036
Well I have a record
deal anyway, so, sorry.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.705
See that's the thing, uh,

20:05.955 --> 20:08.416
I spoke with Robert
tonight, and, uh,

20:08.666 --> 20:10.960
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news,

20:11.211 --> 20:14.714
but your label is
dropping you tomorrow.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.091
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

20:17.342 --> 20:20.720
But the good news
is, if you trust me,

20:21.971 --> 20:24.682
that means I'm in control,
that means good bye to Vanessa,

20:24.933 --> 20:26.684
I can get you a
proper publicist,

20:26.935 --> 20:28.978
I get you a good
wardrobe, a new look,

20:29.229 --> 20:32.148
I even got a new
single teed up for ya.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.733
You know,

20:33.983 --> 20:36.653
a lot of artists, they
don't get second chances,

20:36.903 --> 20:41.491
and I don't need to tell you
what to do with this one.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.415
It's all out there
for you darlin'.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.667
Just take it.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.844
All right, ladies and gents.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.094
Zoe.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.682
Hello.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.835
There you are.

22:16.085 --> 22:16.753
Dad.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.296
Surprised to see me here>

22:18.546 --> 22:19.866
You're not the
only one, let's go.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.507
Dad, wait, how did
you even find me?

22:21.758 --> 22:23.176
Even your dad has Facebook.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.803
Whoa, 1600 likes already>

22:26.054 --> 22:27.055
That's insane.

22:27.305 --> 22:28.389
Chad?

22:28.639 --> 22:30.159
Aren't you supposed
to be at home, too>

22:30.266 --> 22:31.266
Yes, sir.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.895
See, let's go.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.146
- Come on.
- Dad.

22:36.397 --> 22:39.692
Oh, hey, you did
really good tonight.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.617
We'll see you at church.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.103
Do you have any idea
how dangerous it is

22:58.127 --> 22:59.407
to be out at this time of night?

22:59.462 --> 23:01.506
It's not dangerous at all.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.257
We know almost
everyone in there.

23:03.508 --> 23:04.550
It's 11 o'clock, Zoe.

23:04.801 --> 23:05.801
Anyone can snatch you.

23:06.010 --> 23:06.677
Dad.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.128
I'm not a little girl anymore.

23:08.304 --> 23:08.846
Yes, you are.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.098
No I'm not!

23:10.348 --> 23:10.973
What are you doin' here anyway>

23:11.224 --> 23:12.392
I want to perform.

23:12.642 --> 23:13.768
You perform every Sunday.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.686
I wanna perform
outside of that bubble.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.105
Well save it for Sundays.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.689
So, bury my talent>

23:18.940 --> 23:23.361
Performing at church is not
burying your talent, okay>

23:25.571 --> 23:26.781
Hey.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.031
Look at me.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.619
Don't pull a stunt
like that again, okay>

23:36.541 --> 23:38.918
I know you probably saw this
comin', but you're grounded.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.253
Grounded?

23:40.503 --> 23:42.106
Yes, grounded. You snuck
out of the house in the middle

23:42.130 --> 23:43.339
of the night, Zoe.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.192
If there's ever an open and
shut case for grounding,

23:45.216 --> 23:46.216
it's this one.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.719
Why are you always like this?

23:48.970 --> 23:49.988
Because I'm your father.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.931
No, you're just a giant cliche!

23:52.181 --> 23:53.558
I am not a baby.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.563
Why won't you just
let me be who I am?

23:58.813 --> 24:00.189
And who is that, huh>

24:00.440 --> 24:02.817
I mean, do you even know?

24:03.067 --> 24:04.068
I miss mom.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.156
Me, too.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.962
Okay y'all, so I don't
understand why I have

24:16.080 --> 24:17.498
to change my accent?

24:17.748 --> 24:19.834
I mean, this is the way
I've talked my whole life.

24:20.084 --> 24:23.880
Cameron, your manager,
thought that if you really

24:24.130 --> 24:26.591
wanted to make yourself over,
getting rid of your accent

24:26.841 --> 24:29.051
is an important step.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.555
Okay, but I thought this
new look was plenty different.

24:32.805 --> 24:37.768
Your manager says your
voice is going down one lane,

24:39.061 --> 24:40.781
meaning that there's a
whole handful of fans

24:40.813 --> 24:42.940
who will understand you.

24:43.191 --> 24:45.193
You're a pop star now.

24:46.486 --> 24:50.740
We want to steer your
speech to the entire road,

24:50.990 --> 24:53.326
to appeal to the masses, thus,

24:54.911 --> 24:55.911
stardom.

24:57.205 --> 25:00.458
Just got to put your voice
box through a little bootcamp.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.585
You'll be fine.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.797
With me, your lips
will be doing push ups,

25:07.048 --> 25:10.843
and your vocal chords will
be doing 10-mile hikes.

25:11.093 --> 25:15.181
In other words, your mouth
has just been drafted.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.143
Okay.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.229
People, okay.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.855
This part is just for the stars.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.190
Thank you.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.485
Okay, I think I've got a
good handle on what you want

25:27.735 --> 25:29.654
for the new album cover.

25:29.904 --> 25:30.904
So we get to work?

25:31.113 --> 25:33.199
- I guess.
- Okay, let's do it.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.284
Oh you are beautiful.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.203
I like it, I like it.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.791
Yeah, beautiful.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.084
Oh my god, yes.

25:44.335 --> 25:45.836
Oh, you are so beautiful.

25:46.087 --> 25:47.922
Yeah, give me more
smiling, more smiling.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.172
Yeah.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.718
Oh my goodness, yeah,
I love it, I love it.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.053
Yes.

25:54.303 --> 25:57.265
Yes, it's your moment,
it's your time, yeah.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.058
You are my queen today, eh?

25:59.308 --> 26:00.308
Yeah, perfect.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.563
Yeah, you are so beautiful.

26:03.813 --> 26:04.981
Yeah, more energy.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.900
Yeah, give me
more, give me more.

26:08.150 --> 26:08.693
Yeah.

26:08.943 --> 26:09.986
I love it.

26:10.236 --> 26:10.778
Woo.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.028
Oh my god.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.115
We have amazing photos.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.075
Do you like it?

26:17.994 --> 26:19.328
What was I thinkin'>

26:19.579 --> 26:24.542
I don't even know how I could
possibly have fallen for this.

26:25.459 --> 26:26.627
This isn't me.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.379
Thank you.

26:30.506 --> 26:34.010
Maybe I started changing
a long time ago.

26:35.386 --> 26:39.056
Cameron, why are you not
answerin' your phone?

26:39.307 --> 26:41.243
I mean, you were supposed
to be here at this shoot,

26:41.267 --> 26:43.436
and it was a disaster.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.062
I'm not wearing this outfit,

26:45.313 --> 26:47.440
I'm not wearing this
wig tonight at the show.

26:47.690 --> 26:50.359
I guess I'll see you backstage.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.626
Cameron, you left
your phone in here.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.195
Okay.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.160
Well hello everybody.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.210
Welcome to the world
famous Wild Horse Saloon.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.538
My name is Stormy Warren,

27:44.789 --> 27:48.542
and after a whirlwind tour,
Faith Winters making her

27:48.793 --> 27:51.837
45th stop right
here in music city,

27:52.088 --> 27:54.423
and gaining the whole world
with her with her hit song.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.550
"World On Fire," it's time.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.841
Ladies and gentlemen, would
you please make welcome,

27:59.011 --> 28:03.307
Faith Winters.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.853
Vanessa.

28:08.104 --> 28:11.232
Hey, will you just
meet me at the house>

28:14.485 --> 28:16.612
Faith, Faith, I don't blame you.

28:16.862 --> 28:17.982
This is not what I wanted.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.365
I never wanted this.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.659
I know, I know honey.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.285
Let me help you.

28:24.995 --> 28:25.995
I know.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.793
How, how long do you
plan on being gone?

28:31.043 --> 28:32.795
As long as it takes.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.464
Faith, as long as
it takes for what?

28:35.715 --> 28:36.715
To what>

28:38.134 --> 28:39.677
Find my joy again.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.061
Can I ask you somethin'>

28:49.311 --> 28:51.456
And would you be honest with
me? Please be honest with me.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.107
Yes, yes, anything.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.692
Cameron and Pia.

28:57.778 --> 28:58.778
I'm sorry.

29:01.532 --> 29:02.532
I knew it.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.785
Gosh, I knew it.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.838
I'm not gonna let them
make a fool out of me.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.290
Faith.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.125
Take care of my place, would ya>

29:11.375 --> 29:15.129
And whenever Cameron shows
up, throw that in his face.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.965
You know what, Faith?

29:18.215 --> 29:21.051
I think I'm gonna enjoy this.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.302
Here.

29:23.888 --> 29:24.889
Listen to me.

29:25.139 --> 29:26.223
I love you.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.310
I love you, Faith.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.107
Now you listen to me.

29:35.357 --> 29:37.443
I want you to forget all
about Cameron and Pia,

29:37.693 --> 29:40.529
and I mean, my gosh, I want
you to forget about me, too.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.783
This isn't about us,
this is about you.

29:44.033 --> 29:46.368
What do you wanna create next>

29:47.661 --> 29:50.456
And if runnin'
aint the answer...

29:50.706 --> 29:53.834
Then like a daisy, I'll grow.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.512
My daddy always said,

30:04.762 --> 30:07.223
"Honey, you can always
follow your dreams."

30:07.473 --> 30:09.600
"And no matter where
those dreams take you,"

30:09.850 --> 30:12.144
"you can always come home."

30:52.226 --> 30:55.396
The road to Him is
littered with pain and hurt.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.082
Through night's over,
he did provide a path

30:57.106 --> 30:57.815
to forgiveness.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.234
Your anguish is not in vain.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.324
The almighty God paved
a way so that we could

31:07.575 --> 31:09.785
experience a new day.

31:10.035 --> 31:10.786
Amen.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.246
Amen.

31:12.496 --> 31:13.539
Go, be blessed.

31:13.789 --> 31:14.498
There's no prayer
meeting tonight,

31:14.748 --> 31:17.251
so we'll see y'all Wednesday.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.508
Look what the breeze blew in.

31:27.428 --> 31:28.762
Faith.

31:29.013 --> 31:30.013
What are you doin' here>

31:30.055 --> 31:31.055
Hey Gavin.

31:32.975 --> 31:36.186
Have you met my daughter, Zoe>

31:36.437 --> 31:37.980
I don't believe I have.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.399
You're Faith Winters.

31:40.649 --> 31:41.942
Last I checked.

31:42.192 --> 31:46.363
Zoe, will you give Faith
and I a couple minutes>

31:46.614 --> 31:47.614
Please?

31:49.491 --> 31:50.491
Amy?

31:50.534 --> 31:51.076
Come on now.

31:51.327 --> 31:52.494
All right, thanks.

31:52.745 --> 31:56.874
I'm sure you'll get a chance
to do more than stare soon.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.075
I'm sure you will too, darlin'.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.671
Come on, let's go.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.471
Well that was a little
more uncomfortable

32:10.721 --> 32:12.139
than I thought it'd be.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.350
I didn't realize so
many people hated me.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.936
No, they don't hate you.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.229
They just don't understand you.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.440
Does that include you?

32:23.067 --> 32:24.107
What are you doin' here>

32:24.318 --> 32:25.878
I just, guess I
just needed to get out

32:26.070 --> 32:28.197
of town for a bit.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.908
Isn't that what you said
when you left Smithville?

32:31.158 --> 32:32.743
Sounds like me.

32:32.993 --> 32:37.289
So, um, I'm gonna be in town
for at least a few days.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.558
You know how it
is when you visit.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.460
Gotta make the rounds, but, um,

32:41.710 --> 32:43.712
maybe we can catch up.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.133
You stayin' with your momma?

32:48.384 --> 32:48.926
Yeah.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.053
I mean, I mean I think.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.139
She doesn't even know yet.

32:54.390 --> 32:55.724
You haven't talked to her yet>

32:55.975 --> 32:57.601
No, this is the
first place I came.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.353
Why?

32:59.603 --> 33:02.940
Because it's Sunday
mornin', pastor.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.510
Actually, I thought
she'd be here.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.026
I'm kind of surprised she's not.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.587
Yeah, I haven't
seen her in a while.

33:07.611 --> 33:10.656
She's actually on my list
for a home visit, so.

33:10.906 --> 33:11.906
Faith.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.578
Is everything all right?

33:16.829 --> 33:17.829
Yeah.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.958
Just workin' on me.

33:23.711 --> 33:25.212
Workin' on you.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.590
Well it's good to see you.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.469
It's good to see you, too.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.720
All right.

33:40.644 --> 33:41.645
Faith!

33:43.605 --> 33:45.858
You stole my car, you know!

33:47.026 --> 33:49.278
I should call the cops!

33:58.537 --> 34:00.372
Well what are you
gonna do Vanessa?

34:00.622 --> 34:01.622
Shoot me?

34:02.207 --> 34:03.542
Well.

34:03.792 --> 34:04.918
Faith wouldn't.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.169
But I would.

34:10.924 --> 34:11.924
Okay.

34:12.801 --> 34:13.802
Vanessa?

34:14.678 --> 34:15.679
Cameron.

34:17.431 --> 34:20.559
Look, all I wanna know
is where's Faith at?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.561
Well, let me see.

34:22.811 --> 34:23.811
Nope.

34:23.853 --> 34:24.853
I don't know.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.106
You haven't seen her?

34:26.356 --> 34:27.356
Nope.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.027
Then let me guess.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.779
You're upset about
what happened.

34:32.029 --> 34:34.947
Oh, you mean about
Seth firing me?

34:35.199 --> 34:37.618
Oh Seth didn't
fire you, sweetheart.

34:37.868 --> 34:38.577
I did.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.996
Surprise, surprise.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.665
I don't know what you
think, but the only thing

34:43.916 --> 34:45.833
we've ever had in
common is Faith.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.853
And once I started to see
that you were driving a wedge

34:47.878 --> 34:49.731
between the two of us,
something had to be done.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.966
Yeah, well, I've been with
Faith since the beginning.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.676
Oh who cares>

34:54.927 --> 34:56.780
When I met Faith, she was
nothing but a little girl

34:56.804 --> 34:58.889
with bad hair and
stars in her eyes.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.299
And I built her into a brand.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.558
I'm the one who made her.

35:01.809 --> 35:03.244
No, that's where
you're wrong, Cameron.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.561
She made you.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.315
Now let me guess.

35:08.565 --> 35:12.027
These same lights
that she longed for

35:12.277 --> 35:14.321
suddenly became too bright.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.907
I don't know where Faith is.

35:18.408 --> 35:21.495
I do know that she
left that for you.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.707
And this for me.

35:28.252 --> 35:29.252
We all knew.

35:30.838 --> 35:34.299
Maybe that little ring looked
better on Pia's finger.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.886
This is going back
on Faith's finger.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.513
You just watch.

35:39.763 --> 35:40.806
I'll do that.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.354
Dang, that felt good.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.190
Mom?

35:50.440 --> 35:51.440
Faith?

35:53.277 --> 35:54.277
Faith?

35:55.445 --> 35:57.990
Honey, what are you doin' here?

35:58.240 --> 35:59.408
What am I doin'>

35:59.658 --> 36:00.742
What are you doin'?

36:00.993 --> 36:02.661
Oh, just blowin' off steam.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.663
Late night at the
hospital last night.

36:04.913 --> 36:05.956
Hospital?

36:06.206 --> 36:07.350
What are you doin'
at the hospital?

36:07.374 --> 36:08.750
I went back to work.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.003
I'm going crazy
around here by myself.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.253
When?

36:12.421 --> 36:14.298
Oh a few months ago.

36:14.548 --> 36:15.716
Look at you.

36:15.966 --> 36:16.966
Why didn't you tell me>

36:17.050 --> 36:18.677
'Cause I didn't
want you to worry.

36:18.927 --> 36:23.056
Now come on, let's go inside
and get you cleaned up.

36:27.477 --> 36:28.604
Sweet tea?

36:28.854 --> 36:30.856
Oh, that'd be great.

36:32.316 --> 36:34.443
Sorry for just
showin' up like this.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.253
Honey, you never
have to apologize for

36:36.320 --> 36:37.738
that kind of surprise now.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.615
I'm so happy to see ya.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.700
Now tell me everything.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.761
You mean you hadn't
heard what's been going on?

36:43.785 --> 36:45.078
I have.

36:45.329 --> 36:46.809
Sometimes it gets
hot in the spotlight

36:46.914 --> 36:48.040
and you got to take a break.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.374
I understand.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.594
Yeah, it wasn't nearly
as bad as it looked.

36:52.794 --> 36:53.921
Never is.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.256
So how long are you gonna stay?

36:56.506 --> 36:58.258
I don't know.

36:58.508 --> 37:02.387
I just needed to get out of
Nashville for a little while.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.240
You now I literally felt
like I was losing control

37:04.264 --> 37:05.264
of myself.

37:07.017 --> 37:09.269
Well those nails are different.

37:10.479 --> 37:11.479
Yep.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.334
You know, I went through
a bad girl phase when I

37:14.358 --> 37:16.276
was on the road
for a few months.

37:16.526 --> 37:17.526
Nuh uh.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.737
I never saw any pictures.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.573
'Cause I burned 'em.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.492
When that part of
my life was over,

37:23.742 --> 37:25.035
it was over.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.787
Yeah, but do you ever miss it?

37:27.037 --> 37:28.580
Hm, sometimes.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.540
Now was that
before or after dad?

37:30.791 --> 37:32.251
Both, actually.

37:32.501 --> 37:33.502
That's when we met.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.588
I was going through
that phase, poor thing.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.675
He probably thought I pulled
a bait and switch on him.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.219
Turns out the bad girl
he thought he was gettin'

37:42.469 --> 37:44.096
was a goody goody after all.

37:45.806 --> 37:48.684
And he didn't seem to mind.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.561
Always loved watchin'
the two of you together.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.106
I still wish I could see
those pictures, though.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.316
So, uh, how's Cameron?

37:57.359 --> 37:58.359
He's fine.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.488
What happened?

38:01.738 --> 38:02.906
Just, stuff.

38:05.325 --> 38:09.663
Let's just say, we don't
want the same things in life.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.624
To be honest, I
never liked him anyway.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.001
Mom.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.145
I told Wanda Templeton
he was trouble the minute

38:16.169 --> 38:17.629
I laid eyes on him.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.357
Well Wanda Templeton
didn't seem to be

38:19.381 --> 38:20.716
too happy to see
me this mornin'.

38:20.966 --> 38:21.966
Where'd you see her>

38:22.175 --> 38:23.175
At Movement.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.720
You went to church this mornin'?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.972
Yeah, I mean, I
thought you'd be there.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.974
You thought I'd be there?

38:29.224 --> 38:30.684
Or somebody else?

38:32.227 --> 38:34.646
Don't read too much into it.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.024
I was just passin' through town.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.026
Yeah, sure you were.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.445
Seriously mom.

38:41.695 --> 38:43.488
Congregation looked awful thin.

38:43.739 --> 38:44.865
I know.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.784
It's been bad for
a while now, Faith.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.870
I don't know what
the problem is.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.955
Poor Gavin's been
working himself to death

38:52.205 --> 38:54.291
to try to get to
the bottom of it.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.961
I'd be there if I
wasn't workin' so much.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.755
Do you need money?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.214
No.

39:01.465 --> 39:03.258
Don't be silly.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.302
Honey, your dad's
been gone for a while,

39:05.552 --> 39:07.763
but he's still taking
great care of me.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.598
I know.

39:09.848 --> 39:10.848
I just...

39:15.145 --> 39:16.813
Do you think Gavin needs money?

39:17.064 --> 39:18.815
You came here to
solve your problems.

39:19.066 --> 39:22.235
Not mine, not your
ex-boyfriend's.

39:22.486 --> 39:24.246
You need to be sweepin'
around your own porch

39:24.404 --> 39:27.282
before you go sweeping
around everyone else's.

39:27.532 --> 39:31.953
Now tell me what the heck
happened with Cameron.

39:34.498 --> 39:36.583
What does she do on
that phone all day?

39:36.833 --> 39:37.918
Lord knows.

39:39.753 --> 39:40.796
Hey.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.422
So,

39:42.672 --> 39:46.885
Faith just shows up at
church this morning?

39:47.135 --> 39:49.197
Well yeah, if you were
there, you would've seen her.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.890
You know I had
that Skype with Mike.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.059
So, let me guess.

39:54.309 --> 39:57.062
She arrives after the offering.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.956
Let me tell you somethin',
I'm gonna go on the record

39:58.980 --> 40:02.192
and just say that 1/10th
of her weekly income

40:02.442 --> 40:05.028
could keep your lights
on, for a while.

40:05.278 --> 40:06.278
Annie.

40:07.739 --> 40:08.990
How'd she look?

40:09.991 --> 40:11.368
You've seen her.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.012
No, no, I've just seen
her in those music videos.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.288
I don't know what kind of
special effects they use.

40:15.539 --> 40:16.873
She looks great.

40:17.124 --> 40:19.626
And she's still beautiful.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.461
Oh no, not again.

40:21.711 --> 40:22.712
What>

40:22.963 --> 40:25.132
"She's still beautiful."

40:26.466 --> 40:30.262
No, I am serious, you are
not gonna do that again.

40:30.512 --> 40:31.179
Do what again?

40:31.430 --> 40:32.139
You know.

40:32.389 --> 40:33.515
No, I don't know.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.851
Oh, okay, okay, let
me reel it in and spell

40:36.101 --> 40:37.519
it out for you.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.982
You are not going to fall in
love with Faith Winters again.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.650
I know.

40:43.900 --> 40:44.900
Do you?

40:46.194 --> 40:47.588
Yeah, you've got that same
dumb look on your face

40:47.612 --> 40:50.740
you had when you first
met her in 11th grade.

40:50.991 --> 40:51.991
It's different.

40:52.159 --> 40:53.160
I'm different.

40:53.410 --> 40:54.536
And heck, I'm a father now.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.539
She's, she's way different.

40:57.789 --> 40:58.874
Yeah.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.792
Way, way different.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.046
Way different,
you remember that.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.924
Hey, Gavin.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.844
Janet's been, she's been gone
for almost three years now.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.134
Don't you think it's time>

41:12.304 --> 41:13.304
Time for what>

41:13.430 --> 41:13.972
To date>

41:14.222 --> 41:15.222
Date who>

41:15.265 --> 41:15.932
Jenny Sharp?

41:16.183 --> 41:16.850
What's wrong with Jenny Sharp>

41:17.100 --> 41:19.019
She's Zoe's
teacher for starters.

41:19.269 --> 41:20.749
Well there's always
summer vacation?

41:22.314 --> 41:23.648
We have nothin' in common.

41:23.899 --> 41:25.400
Same church, same home town.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.904
I don't think one of
those things is an accident.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.947
She's a good girl,
Gavin, and she's pretty

41:31.198 --> 41:34.242
and she thinks the sun
rises and sets in you.

41:34.493 --> 41:37.162
Annie, I'm not
interested in Jenny Sharp.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.497
I don't really care.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.183
I don't care who you
date or if you date.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.209
I just want you to be happy.

41:42.459 --> 41:44.659
And the last time that Faith
Winters put a spell on you,

41:44.794 --> 41:47.756
I had to peel you
off the pavement.

41:48.006 --> 41:48.548
It wasn't that bad.

41:48.798 --> 41:50.050
It was bad.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.500
You didn't eat for three days.

41:51.676 --> 41:52.761
I was fasting.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.305
You didn't shower for seven.

41:57.807 --> 41:58.433
Here.

41:58.683 --> 41:59.683
I don't want it.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.603
Have some, it's good.

42:03.522 --> 42:07.067
Did I ever steer you
wrong, little brother?

42:07.317 --> 42:10.654
So I walked out, drove
all night, and here I am.

42:10.904 --> 42:14.115
So you left Nashville
to find your joy>

42:15.742 --> 42:20.413
Honey, when are you ever gonna
find what you're lookin' for?

42:22.123 --> 42:23.375
Well who in the world?

42:23.625 --> 42:26.211
No, stay momma, I'll get it.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.217
Hey, Gavin.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.428
I'm glad you came by.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.264
Yeah, is your mom home?

42:37.514 --> 42:38.848
My mom?

42:39.099 --> 42:41.118
Yeah, I told you she's
on my list for home visits.

42:41.142 --> 42:42.561
I just was checkin' in.

42:42.811 --> 42:43.979
Gavin.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.439
What are you doin' here>

42:46.690 --> 42:48.817
You haven't been in
Movement for a few weeks.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.336
Just wanted to check in,
make sure you're all right,

42:50.360 --> 42:51.069
didn't need anything.

42:51.319 --> 42:52.612
I'm fine.

42:52.862 --> 42:55.991
I picked up a few extra shifts
at the hospital and, uh,

42:56.241 --> 42:57.993
as soon as I'm clear
of that, I'll be back.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.036
Yeah, well, Movement misses you.

43:00.287 --> 43:02.998
And the choir is not
the same without you.

43:03.248 --> 43:04.248
Well I miss it.

43:04.332 --> 43:05.332
I miss y'all.

43:06.251 --> 43:09.254
Look, I'm off on
Thursday nights, so,

43:10.630 --> 43:13.049
maybe I could come back and
help out with choir practice

43:13.300 --> 43:14.843
if that'd be okay?

43:15.093 --> 43:16.720
Yeah, that'd be great.

43:16.970 --> 43:17.971
Consider it done.

43:18.221 --> 43:20.932
And here I thought you'd
come to find Faith.

43:21.182 --> 43:22.225
Mom.

43:22.475 --> 43:24.115
Don't tell me you
didn't think the same.

43:24.352 --> 43:25.352
I didn't.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.563
Mhm.

43:26.813 --> 43:29.149
All right, well
you have a good day.

43:29.399 --> 43:30.984
Gavin, hey.

43:31.234 --> 43:33.570
I know you got to make
your rounds, but,

43:33.820 --> 43:35.339
what do you say you just
take a break for a bit

43:35.363 --> 43:36.656
and go with me>

43:39.409 --> 43:41.411
Go with you where, Faith>

43:42.787 --> 43:43.872
It's crazy.

43:45.415 --> 43:46.666
What's crazy?

43:47.959 --> 43:51.087
Just the fact that it
all looks just the same.

43:51.338 --> 43:53.298
It hasn't changed a bit.

43:53.548 --> 43:56.134
It's exactly the
way you left it.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.261
The way I left it?

43:58.511 --> 44:00.388
You know what I mean.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.851
Why are we at the high school>

44:07.062 --> 44:08.205
Dang, it feels like I
was down there cheerin'

44:08.229 --> 44:10.023
just like yesterday.

44:11.358 --> 44:12.734
Time flies.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.253
Do you remember the time
that the student section

44:14.277 --> 44:16.197
collapsed and Benny Daniels
got hung by that nail

44:16.446 --> 44:18.073
on his pants?

44:18.323 --> 44:20.323
I remember looking up
from the sideline thinkin',

44:20.450 --> 44:23.244
"The band just got a
whole lot smaller."

44:23.495 --> 44:25.789
You know at that point,
I think I was 10 for 10,

44:26.039 --> 44:29.000
two touchdowns,
game of my career,

44:29.250 --> 44:31.044
before the ref stopped play.

44:31.294 --> 44:32.647
If it wasn't for those
bleachers and that wedgie,

44:32.671 --> 44:34.881
I might have a scholarship.

44:35.131 --> 44:36.359
Yeah, but would
you have taken it?

44:36.383 --> 44:37.467
The scholarship>

44:37.717 --> 44:39.195
Yeah, would you ever
have left Smithville?

44:39.219 --> 44:40.679
Of course I would.

44:45.225 --> 44:46.810
Why'd you bring me here, Faith?

44:47.060 --> 44:49.121
I got somethin' to say, I
just don't know how to say it.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.815
Just open your mouth and speak.

44:52.065 --> 44:53.483
Zoe's growing up.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.946
Time does what it does.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.365
Yeah, and what's that>

45:00.615 --> 45:01.700
It ticks.

45:01.950 --> 45:04.119
Right now I'm trying to
manage the wonder years.

45:04.369 --> 45:08.331
Being, I wonder how I'm
ever gonna get through 'em.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.043
I mean, Zoe's a teenager
in every sense of the word.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.879
Needs less of me and
more of everything else.

45:15.130 --> 45:16.423
Games, friends.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.135
Yeah, kids nowadays
always textin'.

45:20.385 --> 45:20.927
Facebook.

45:21.177 --> 45:22.177
Snapchattin'.

45:22.303 --> 45:24.514
What's Snapchattin'?

45:26.558 --> 45:28.059
Guess I am gettin' old, huh?

45:28.309 --> 45:29.686
No, you're not.

45:29.936 --> 45:32.105
The world just moves at
a different pace now.

45:32.355 --> 45:35.734
You know when Janet
and I took her in,

45:36.943 --> 45:38.570
we didn't really
know what to expect.

45:38.820 --> 45:41.030
She was a kid in a
shelter, a stranger,

45:41.281 --> 45:43.050
and neither of us had any
idea how to raise a kid.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.074
I mean, heck.

45:44.159 --> 45:45.243
We were kids ourselves.

45:45.493 --> 45:46.929
But God told me to reach
out my hand to that

45:46.953 --> 45:48.413
scared little girl.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.458
And when we got
home that first day,

45:51.708 --> 45:56.504
she made me promise her that
she'd never be alone again.

45:58.339 --> 46:01.342
If I hadn't made that promise,
I might not be here today.

46:01.593 --> 46:03.303
What do you mean>

46:05.013 --> 46:07.307
When Janet got sick,
I had some dark days.

46:07.557 --> 46:08.868
Questioning everything
kind of dark,

46:08.892 --> 46:10.161
and it's like when I
looked into the mirror,

46:10.185 --> 46:13.104
I didn't recognize the
face staring back at me.

46:13.354 --> 46:16.149
How'd you get out
of that darkness?

46:16.399 --> 46:17.918
Thankfully I had Zoe
to keep me laughin'

46:17.942 --> 46:20.236
and Annie to keep me sane.

46:20.487 --> 46:21.922
Yeah, but what if
you hadn't of had them,

46:21.946 --> 46:23.448
then what would you have done?

46:23.698 --> 46:25.658
What are you asking me, Faith?

46:25.909 --> 46:27.285
Would you have called me?

46:27.535 --> 46:29.430
I did try calling you but
you were always too busy.

46:29.454 --> 46:31.664
Your people were more than
glad to let me know that.

46:31.915 --> 46:32.957
I'm sorry Gavin.

46:33.208 --> 46:34.793
Why'd you bring me here>

46:35.043 --> 46:37.045
Mom said things at church
aren't going so well.

46:37.295 --> 46:38.588
They're fine.

46:38.838 --> 46:40.399
Listen, if you need
me to float you some...

46:40.423 --> 46:41.800
I'm sayin' no.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.845
I appreciate the offer.

46:47.013 --> 46:50.225
But God will provide,
he always has.

46:50.475 --> 46:54.771
But what if he led me
home so that I can help?

46:55.021 --> 46:56.457
What if you came home
because you don't know

46:56.481 --> 46:57.607
how to be still?

46:59.526 --> 47:01.736
Is that what you think?

47:01.986 --> 47:04.089
I think you're afraid of
letting go and letting God.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.508
Yeah, and what's
so wrong with that?

47:05.532 --> 47:07.760
If the bird never let go, it
wouldn't have learned to fly.

47:07.784 --> 47:09.702
There's the pastor speak again.

47:09.953 --> 47:12.033
Can you talk to me in
something other than a parable?

47:12.080 --> 47:14.120
What do you want me to
do, Faith? Be angry at you?

47:14.332 --> 47:15.332
Yes.

47:15.458 --> 47:16.543
Why?

47:16.793 --> 47:18.393
Because then maybe
I can stop being mad

47:18.461 --> 47:21.548
at myself for the both of
us and just be mad for me.

47:21.798 --> 47:23.918
I may never forgive myself
for not being there for you

47:23.967 --> 47:25.176
when Janet died.

47:25.426 --> 47:26.427
You chose your life.

47:26.678 --> 47:28.388
Nobody begrudges you that.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.158
Dang it, Gavin,
stop giving me a pass

47:30.348 --> 47:31.975
and start making me accountable.

47:32.225 --> 47:34.602
You knew what you were Faith.

47:34.853 --> 47:36.604
What good is that gonna
do anyone now, huh>

47:36.855 --> 47:40.191
Look, if you want me
to be angry at you,

47:40.441 --> 47:42.241
so that you can live
with yourself, I'm sorry.

47:42.318 --> 47:44.237
I can't do that.

47:44.487 --> 47:46.197
But you can forgive me.

47:46.447 --> 47:47.448
Yep.

47:50.451 --> 47:53.329
I need to go check
in at Annie's.

47:57.750 --> 47:58.750
Faith?

48:01.504 --> 48:02.544
Why did you bring me here?

48:02.672 --> 48:05.258
Because I missed
you, Gavin Whitfield.

48:05.508 --> 48:06.509
Me, too.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.030
But the canyon between
our lives is too great

48:10.054 --> 48:12.015
for a few words to fill.

48:23.443 --> 48:25.194
All righty handsome.

48:25.445 --> 48:26.529
What'll it be>

48:26.779 --> 48:29.532
I'll take a black coffee
and a grilled cheese.

48:29.782 --> 48:30.491
All right.

48:30.742 --> 48:32.118
You have brie?

48:33.161 --> 48:34.329
Brie?

48:34.579 --> 48:35.579
Yeah.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.707
Cheese, for the sandwich.

48:37.957 --> 48:39.292
Take a look around, sweetie.

48:39.542 --> 48:42.462
We have American, Swiss,
cheddar, and provolone and,

48:42.712 --> 48:46.466
since you seem kind of fancy,
I'd go with the provolone.

48:46.716 --> 48:49.177
Scratch the sandwich,
I'll take the coffee.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.427
All right.

48:50.511 --> 48:51.846
Suit yourself.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.556
Thanks.

48:57.602 --> 48:58.602
Excuse me?

48:59.354 --> 49:00.438
Yeah?

49:00.688 --> 49:03.066
So this, uh, open mic
thing you guys have going on

49:03.316 --> 49:06.903
tomorrow night, anyone
good ever perform?

49:07.153 --> 49:08.993
Sweetie, you're not
from around here, are ya?

49:09.113 --> 49:10.156
Afraid not.

49:10.406 --> 49:11.634
Yeah, I could tell
with that whole cheese

49:11.658 --> 49:12.909
business thing.

49:14.535 --> 49:16.415
But the truth is that we
do have a lot of talent

49:16.621 --> 49:17.997
and people perform here.

49:18.247 --> 49:20.667
As a matter of fact, Faith
Winters is from Smithville.

49:20.917 --> 49:21.584
Heard of her?

49:21.834 --> 49:24.253
The country music singer>

49:24.504 --> 49:26.714
Word has it, she's back in town.

49:26.965 --> 49:28.651
Kind of hoping she swings
through and gives us

49:28.675 --> 49:30.009
a private concert.

49:32.011 --> 49:34.263
That'd be very special.

49:34.514 --> 49:36.557
Yes it would.

49:41.688 --> 49:45.525
Faith, I'm in
Smithville, please call me.

49:47.110 --> 49:48.277
Here you go.

49:49.779 --> 49:50.779
Thanks.

49:51.698 --> 49:53.950
Can't get enough of this.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.678
They don't have
sweet tea in Nashville?

49:55.702 --> 49:56.702
Oh, they do.

49:56.828 --> 49:58.579
It just aint the same.

50:02.333 --> 50:03.933
Well, I guess I'm
gonna turn my phone on.

50:04.127 --> 50:06.504
Is that supposed to be a
big deal for some reason?

50:06.754 --> 50:10.508
Well it hasn't been on
since I left Nashville.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.719
How much you wanna bet I
got a hundred messages?

50:12.969 --> 50:14.689
Girl you got the
gamblin' from your daddy.

50:14.804 --> 50:16.848
You got the singin' from me.

50:17.098 --> 50:19.350
This is the stuff I miss.

50:22.729 --> 50:27.275
Man, I forgot how quiet it
can be without all the noise.

50:29.027 --> 50:31.362
You get to actually
see the stars out here.

50:31.612 --> 50:32.612
Yep.

50:32.739 --> 50:34.365
Aint nothin' like it.

50:35.616 --> 50:38.745
I can see the whole
world from right here.

50:40.204 --> 50:42.457
Maybe that's what I need.

50:43.833 --> 50:47.712
To see the world a little
differently for a while.

53:12.398 --> 53:13.482
I love you.

53:19.655 --> 53:20.823
What's this>

53:21.824 --> 53:23.201
Homework.

53:23.451 --> 53:25.828
You workin' on your homework?

53:26.078 --> 53:27.078
Wow.

53:27.246 --> 53:28.873
Hold that pose.

53:29.123 --> 53:31.083
I've got to preserve
this moment.

53:31.334 --> 53:33.461
Who do I get to thank
for this miracle?

53:33.711 --> 53:36.172
- Your aunt Annie.
- Howdy Gavin.

53:36.422 --> 53:37.757
Jenny.

53:38.007 --> 53:39.425
I didn't even realize
you were here.

53:39.675 --> 53:41.355
Oh yeah well, Annie
called me and told me

53:41.594 --> 53:44.055
that Zoe was having some
trouble with her homework, so,

53:44.305 --> 53:46.265
I wasn't doing anything
else tonight and I figured

53:46.349 --> 53:49.185
I might as well come
over and help y'all out.

53:49.435 --> 53:50.621
I mean heaven knows
y'all have enough

53:50.645 --> 53:52.605
to worry about right now.

53:52.855 --> 53:53.397
That's very nice of ya...

53:53.648 --> 53:54.648
How's Faith>

53:54.690 --> 53:55.775
She's good.

53:56.609 --> 53:58.194
Oh, there you are.

53:58.444 --> 53:59.654
I was gettin' worried.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.824
You know, I know how you
Whitfields like to sneak

54:02.073 --> 54:04.200
around at night and all.

54:04.450 --> 54:05.450
Too soon.

54:06.953 --> 54:08.746
- Did you have a nice visit>
- Yeah.

54:08.996 --> 54:10.474
I didn't realize Jenny
was gonna be here.

54:10.498 --> 54:13.709
I just was thanking
her for helping Zoe.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.253
I think I'm finished.

54:15.503 --> 54:16.754
Would you take a look?

54:17.004 --> 54:18.381
Happy to help.

54:24.387 --> 54:26.138
That's very good, Zoe.

54:27.098 --> 54:28.098
Well.

54:32.186 --> 54:34.981
Well, I'm gonna get
my stuff and, um,

54:35.231 --> 54:37.817
I'm gonna be headin' out then.

54:39.151 --> 54:40.151
Okay.

54:40.903 --> 54:42.613
- Bye.
- Bye, Jenny.

54:42.863 --> 54:43.863
Thanks for comin'.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.783
Thanks, Miss Sharp.

54:46.951 --> 54:47.702
Zoe, you ready to go>

54:47.952 --> 54:49.954
Oh, oh wait.

54:50.204 --> 54:51.431
Mike's gettin'
ready to Skype in.

54:51.455 --> 54:52.498
Y'all come say hi.

54:52.748 --> 54:56.210
Why don't you get your
stuff together, okay>

54:56.460 --> 54:58.421
Come on, come on guys.

55:01.507 --> 55:02.633
Hey babe.

55:02.883 --> 55:03.883
Hi, honey.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.470
How are you?

55:06.721 --> 55:07.388
Hm.

55:07.638 --> 55:08.718
I'm good, hangin' in there.

55:08.889 --> 55:11.058
It's been a quiet
few days, thank God.

55:11.309 --> 55:15.146
Oh wait, I got a couple
of folks that wanna say hi.

55:16.897 --> 55:17.982
What's up, bubba?

55:18.232 --> 55:20.192
Hey did you get the
care package we sent you?

55:20.443 --> 55:23.696
The unit loved the
cookies, thank you so much.

55:23.946 --> 55:25.299
You mean you didn't
eat 'em all yourself?

55:25.323 --> 55:26.323
I wish.

55:27.325 --> 55:29.160
Wait, is that Zoe
back there, too>

55:29.410 --> 55:29.952
Yes.

55:30.202 --> 55:31.202
Hi, Uncle Mike.

55:31.412 --> 55:32.496
Hey, Zo.

55:32.747 --> 55:35.124
How's music class and
dance and everything?

55:35.374 --> 55:36.917
School's almost out.

55:37.168 --> 55:39.337
And your singin',
it's coming along well>

55:39.587 --> 55:40.587
Yes, sir.

55:41.380 --> 55:43.341
For the most part.

55:43.591 --> 55:45.551
Hey y'all, sorry to interrupt.

55:45.801 --> 55:47.803
Oh hi Jenny, what's wrong?

55:48.054 --> 55:50.514
Well, y'all aren't
gonna believe this, but,

55:50.765 --> 55:52.558
my car won't start.

55:52.808 --> 55:53.351
I believe it.

55:53.601 --> 55:54.685
Oh, wow.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.313
Pastor, um, do you mind
giving me a ride home?

55:57.563 --> 55:59.899
Of course, I'll
give you a ride home.

56:00.149 --> 56:02.401
That's so nice of you.

56:03.569 --> 56:04.820
That's nice, isn't it nice?

56:05.071 --> 56:06.071
That's nice.

56:06.113 --> 56:07.758
Um, oh hey, Zoe, you can
just stay here with me

56:07.782 --> 56:08.842
until they get back, right?

56:08.866 --> 56:09.866
Okay.

56:09.950 --> 56:10.534
Oh sis, I don't
wanna put you out.

56:10.785 --> 56:12.244
Oh no, no, no.

56:12.495 --> 56:16.332
Time with my precious
niece, it's a blessing.

56:16.582 --> 56:17.582
Okay.

56:18.542 --> 56:19.902
All right Mike,
you be safe, buddy.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.002
Thank you bud.

56:21.045 --> 56:21.587
See you later.

56:21.837 --> 56:23.672
All right, take care.

56:25.591 --> 56:26.717
Are they gone>

56:26.967 --> 56:28.052
Yeah.

56:28.302 --> 56:29.982
Annie, you're still
trying to set 'em up?

56:30.012 --> 56:31.907
You know what, she's a
good person and she'd be

56:31.931 --> 56:32.932
really good for him.

56:33.182 --> 56:34.850
Never gonna happen.

56:36.977 --> 56:38.747
You know, I thought I was
gonna take you straight home.

56:38.771 --> 56:40.231
Oh come on, don't be such a dud.

56:40.481 --> 56:43.275
Everybody's got to eat,
even pastors, too.

56:43.526 --> 56:46.153
I just got to hurry home to Zoe.

56:48.531 --> 56:51.534
Faith, I'm in Smithville.

56:51.784 --> 56:53.828
Babe, please call me.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.078
It's Cameron.

56:55.287 --> 56:56.997
What does he want?

56:57.248 --> 56:58.582
He's already in Smithville.

56:58.833 --> 56:59.375
What?

56:59.625 --> 57:01.502
He's at Sammy's Cafe.

57:02.878 --> 57:03.878
I got to go.

57:05.047 --> 57:06.767
I wanted to tell you
that I didn't realize

57:06.882 --> 57:09.135
that video was gonna
be such a problem.

57:09.385 --> 57:10.928
But pastor, you
have to understand,

57:11.178 --> 57:15.141
people are really
affected by Zoe's music.

57:15.391 --> 57:17.077
Zoe's talented, but she
shouldn't have been up

57:17.101 --> 57:18.436
here at that time of night, so.

57:18.686 --> 57:22.523
Well, she silenced the
crowd, that's for sure.

57:22.773 --> 57:23.834
You know what they
say about talent

57:23.858 --> 57:25.568
without discipline, don't ya?

57:25.818 --> 57:27.170
It's like an octopus
on roller skates.

57:27.194 --> 57:29.864
A lot of movement, just
don't know what direction

57:30.114 --> 57:31.114
it's goin'.

57:35.286 --> 57:36.286
Okay.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.370
Well.

57:39.248 --> 57:40.248
Y'all hungry>

57:40.291 --> 57:41.834
Starved.

57:42.084 --> 57:43.544
Um, I'll have steak and eggs.

57:43.794 --> 57:46.046
Steak, medium, eggs
over easy, dry toast,

57:46.297 --> 57:47.381
and a diet coke.

57:47.631 --> 57:50.009
Okay, lady knows what
she wants, I like it.

57:50.259 --> 57:51.343
And for you pastor?

57:51.594 --> 57:56.056
Black coffee, my regular,
grilled cheese, American please.

57:57.016 --> 57:58.016
No brie?

57:58.100 --> 57:59.477
Huh?

57:59.727 --> 58:00.895
It's a joke.

58:09.570 --> 58:11.447
Oh, Zoe, I'm so
glad you're here.

58:11.697 --> 58:12.865
I need to talk to your dad.

58:13.115 --> 58:14.783
Oh, he's not here.

58:15.034 --> 58:16.034
What, he just>

58:16.076 --> 58:19.246
He said that he was
comin' to get you.

58:22.208 --> 58:24.835
Well, look who the cat drug in.

58:26.212 --> 58:27.379
Faith Winters.

58:28.339 --> 58:29.381
Annie, hey.

58:31.050 --> 58:32.301
You look great.

58:32.551 --> 58:33.551
Do I>

58:34.887 --> 58:35.887
You do.

58:37.348 --> 58:38.891
Listen, I'm sorry it's so late.

58:39.141 --> 58:41.227
I was just telling Zoe I
really need to find Gavin.

58:41.477 --> 58:43.771
Well I think you heard Zoe
say that Gavin's not here.

58:44.021 --> 58:45.581
Well, I mean, do
you know where he is?

58:45.731 --> 58:47.042
I mean, he's not
answerin' his phone.

58:47.066 --> 58:49.026
I think there's a
good reason for that.

58:49.276 --> 58:50.670
Annie, I know you
would rather have opened

58:50.694 --> 58:52.947
the door for
literally anyone else,

58:53.197 --> 58:55.616
but can you at least help
me get in touch with Gavin?

58:55.866 --> 58:58.160
Why would I do that?

58:58.410 --> 59:00.788
You broke my brother's heart.

59:01.038 --> 59:03.207
I know, I know, and I
wanna have that conversation

59:03.457 --> 59:06.627
with all of you, but
my ex is in town.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.963
And he told me, he said if
he ever had the chance to

59:09.213 --> 59:11.966
come to Smithville, that he
would hunt Gavin down and...

59:12.216 --> 59:13.216
And what?

59:13.425 --> 59:14.611
Well he never
finished the sentence,

59:14.635 --> 59:16.804
but it can't be anything good.

59:17.054 --> 59:19.890
He's with Jenny,
at Sammy's Cafe.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.140
Jenny>

59:21.267 --> 59:23.060
- Jenny Sharp.
- My teacher.

59:23.310 --> 59:24.728
Oh right, right.

59:24.979 --> 59:26.272
That's

59:26.522 --> 59:27.606
complicated.

59:27.856 --> 59:30.109
But um, wait, you
said he's at Sammy's?

59:30.359 --> 59:31.359
Yes.

59:32.069 --> 59:33.069
Uh oh.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.573
She's unbelievably talented.

59:35.823 --> 59:38.117
I mean she sings, she dances.

59:38.367 --> 59:41.036
I just got to get her to
focus on her studies.

59:41.287 --> 59:42.347
I mean, she's gonna have
to get a scholarship

59:42.371 --> 59:43.765
because I don't know how
I'm gonna pay for her

59:43.789 --> 59:45.332
to go to college.

59:45.583 --> 59:48.002
You are such an amazing man.

59:48.252 --> 59:49.461
Jenny.

59:49.712 --> 59:51.314
You got to stop sayin'
that, I'm just a man.

59:51.338 --> 59:54.550
Gavin, you do not
give yourself enough credit.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.094
I'm doing what any
decent father would do.

59:57.344 --> 59:59.930
Excuse me, is your name Gavin?

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.515
Yeah.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:02.933
Pastor Gavin Whitfield?

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.102
Yeah, that's me.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:06.871
I always told Faith
if I had an opportunity

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.331
to meet you, I'd say
thank you for allowing her

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:09.815
to come to Nashville.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.108
Cameron, stop.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:12.460
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Cameron.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:13.986
I'm Faith's fiance.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:15.446
Ex-fiance.

01:00:15.696 --> 01:00:16.696
What are you doin'?

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.185
I was just thankin' Gavin here.

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:18.949
Thank you?

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:19.950
What are you thankin' him for>

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.303
For allowing you
to come to music city

01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:22.327
and spread your wings.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:23.805
I always told you if
I came to Smithville,

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.039
I'd give him a thank you.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:25.956
No.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.434
No, you never finished
that sentence.

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:28.834
Well I sure did intend to.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.145
I owe this man a lot for
bringing you into my life.

01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:31.378
- Well stop.
- Stop what?

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.881
Stop acting like we're
still together, Cameron.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.008
Obviously I left you, remember?

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:38.218
Okay, babe, I made a
mistake but as of yesterday

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:40.095
we were engaged, so calm down.

01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:41.656
Let's go some place
where we can talk.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.949
Don't tell me what to do, okay?

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.242
Can we just go
some place and talk?

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:44.642
- No.
- What about our history?

01:00:44.892 --> 01:00:46.185
What history?

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:47.186
On top of being
engaged, didn't I get you

01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:49.188
your first record deal, huh>

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:50.522
And your second?

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:52.083
Doesn't that mean
anything to you>

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.209
Yeah, yeah, you
know what it means?

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.985
Remember that 10% you collected>

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:56.379
Yeah, check your bank account.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.322
That's how much it meant.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.115
- Faith.
- How's Pia doin', huh?

01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:01.408
Faith.

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:03.118
- How's precious little Pia?
- Faith.

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:04.078
Look, can we go
some place and talk?

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.663
Are you crazy?

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:07.182
Did you just come all the
way here to Smithville

01:01:07.206 --> 01:01:08.516
and thing everything's
gonna be all right, huh?

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.435
Can we go some place and
talk about what you're doin'>

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:11.459
Turn around.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.053
Even in Smithville.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.889
I guess I can't run this time.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.267
Hey y'all.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.265
And your second.

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:31.605
Doesn't that mean
anything to you>

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:32.940
Oh my.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.651
Yeah, remember
that 10% you collected>

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.236
Check your bank
account, baby boy.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:39.238
That's how much it means.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:40.948
This is better than streaming.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:42.438
How's Pia doin', huh> - Faith?

01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:43.551
How's precious little Pia>

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:44.952
Faith, turn around and look.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.513
Can we go some place>
Are you crazy?

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:47.806
Did you just come all the
way here to Smithville

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:51.583
and think everything's
gonna be all right, huh?

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:57.923
I wonder what he's doin' here.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:03.053
Cameron.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:04.513
Pastor Gavin.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:07.099
I'm sure you're shocked to
see me, but I assure you,

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.559
I'm not here for trouble.

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:10.036
I wanna talk to
you about somethin'

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.602
I'm truly interested in.

01:02:10.853 --> 01:02:13.188
Okay, what's that>

01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:15.274
What's the population
of Smithville?

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:17.568
I don't know, six, 7,000 maybe.

01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:20.863
And how many churches
do you guys have here>

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:21.655
Don't know.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:22.448
17.

01:02:22.698 --> 01:02:23.824
You counted?

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.159
Yep.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.911
I even counted the, uh,
converted convenience store

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:29.246
at the edge of town.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.123
I didn't realize
that was a church.

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:33.125
Well, I guess it is.

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.378
But, the point I'm
trying to make is,

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:39.757
once you figure in the
agnostics, those who are

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:42.634
no longer practicing,
people who just don't care

01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:44.928
about religion, and
the downright atheists,

01:02:45.179 --> 01:02:49.308
I guess you could say this
town's a little church heavy.

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:50.601
Church heavy>

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:52.311
It's the law of
diminishing return.

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:53.580
They taught us in economics.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.189
I'm sure you took econ, right?

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.399
Let me try to break it
down in a way that somebody

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:58.501
like yourself can understand.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.068
Oh, I understand.

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.029
Too many churches,
not enough people?

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:03.279
More or less.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:04.591
Yeah, you see, I
don't believe that.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:06.134
I believe people worship
where they're led.

01:03:06.158 --> 01:03:08.198
How many people are
actually in your congregation?

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:09.608
That's none of your business.

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:11.139
Why don't you show up Sunday
and maybe you'll find out.

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:13.707
The other night when
we were at Sammy's Cafe,

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:17.044
before I ran into you, I was
speaking to the waitress.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:18.605
She let me know that
Faith Winters is not

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:20.297
the only musical
prodigy from this town.

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:21.590
She's right.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.600
There's a lot of talented
people around here.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.069
You guys do have
a lot of talent,

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:27.346
but you know what
you don't have?

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:28.722
A record studio.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.060
What's this>

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.645
Just read it.

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:36.438
We're not being foreclosed.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:38.023
Well not today.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:39.501
But this morning I took
the liberty of driving

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:41.360
over to the bank and
speaking to Mr. Daniels,

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.362
your mortgage broker.

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:45.948
He let me know that
you're about 30 days out.

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:47.278
And that's if you're lucky.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.867
So the way I see it,

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.328
we'll have a big fountain
here at the front,

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:52.898
a couple of benches,
and out back,

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.957
we'll put gazebos
along the tree line,

01:03:55.207 --> 01:03:57.352
so the artists will be able
to listen to the birds chirp.

01:03:57.376 --> 01:03:59.044
I'm gonna call them
inspiration spaces.

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.213
Now of course the
church will be gone.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:03.257
But in its place will
be a state of the art

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:06.134
recording studio,
top of the line.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.638
I heard your daughter
is very talented.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:11.056
I'd love to speak with her.

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:14.268
The church is
staying here, buddy.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.605
I'll see you in 30 days, pastor.

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:22.401
Matter of fact, I'll
see you Sunday morning.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.820
Pastor?

01:04:29.283 --> 01:04:31.326
Is Benny serious>

01:04:31.577 --> 01:04:33.161
He's really gonna foreclose>

01:04:33.412 --> 01:04:34.454
He's serious.

01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:38.458
But he did say he'd give
us a little bit of time.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:40.836
That's nice of him, but,

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:43.297
I don't think that's
gonna do us any good.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.923
I'm sorry Gavin,

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:50.137
but you need to take a look at
the ledger though, all right?

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:29.927
Why are you doin' this to me?

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:32.512
What did I do to deserve this>

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:36.934
Is it your will that
I lose the church?

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.831
You took my wife.

01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:04.628
And I was faithful.

01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:10.509
And then my flock,
to other pastures,

01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:12.719
and I was faithful, and now you,

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.139
you rip very the
pulpit from my grasp.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.064
And I'm faithful.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:34.199
All right, there you go.

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:34.992
Thank you.

01:06:35.242 --> 01:06:36.242
Thank you.

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:42.289
Zoe.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.961
Hi Faith, um, Miss Winters.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:47.504
Faith's fine.

01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:52.009
You have one incredible gift.

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:53.427
You really think so>

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:54.678
Think?

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:56.680
Girl, I know.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.598
Come here.

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:03.644
You know,

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.690
when my daddy was alive,
he used to always say

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:10.110
that he believed that music
was a direct connection

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.529
from our mouth, to God's ear.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:14.906
Why?

01:07:15.157 --> 01:07:15.824
Because think about it.

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:18.160
I mean, if you're God,

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:20.370
you got a lot of people prayin'.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.372
That's a lot of noise.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.043
But with music,

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.504
he just has to sit, and listen.

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.214
I like that.

01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:34.926
I think Movement Church needs
God's ear again, don't you?

01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:36.803
So does my dad.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:39.389
Has your dad told
you anything about me?

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.641
He said that y'all dated.

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:45.520
And that he loved you.

01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:47.189
I loved him, too.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:50.984
No.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.487
You don't understand.

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:56.073
He like, loved you, loved you.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.743
Like enough to marry you.

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.163
And then you left.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:04.413
Yeah.

01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:07.501
I might never forgive
myself for that one.

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:08.919
He has.

01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:10.837
I know, he told me.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:13.297
So, um,

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.676
I heard that there's
some problems here.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:25.810
Are you afraid that y'all
are gonna lose the church>

01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:27.562
Well what are we
gonna do about it>

01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:28.939
What do you mean>

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.649
I wasn't there for your
dad when your mom died.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:33.693
And I can't change that.

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.862
But I can be here now.

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:38.615
You have something
already planned, don't you?

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:41.076
Only if you promise to help.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:42.661
I promise.

01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:43.911
Great.

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:45.956
Well I got somebody
who wants to say hi.

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:47.206
Mom?

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.044
Hi Zoe.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.294
Hi Miss Liz.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.296
- How are you?
- Good.

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:55.090
Great.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.006
Are you in?

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:57.258
Yeah.

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:58.384
Great.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:00.470
Good, well, we
need one more person.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.971
Yeah.

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:03.305
Aunt Annie?

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:06.852
Yeah, but we're gonna
need your help with her.

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:20.240
Hey dad.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.490
Hey.

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:23.285
What ya doin'?

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:24.886
I'm lookin' for every
red cent I can find to

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.662
buy Movement some time.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:30.542
Nobody will be able to tell
you your daddy never tried.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:31.792
How was practice?

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.086
It was good.

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:35.964
Great, actually.

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:38.591
Miss Sharp bring you home?

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.848
I think you two need to talk.

01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:48.893
Love you.

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:50.895
Love you too.

01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:58.612
I thought I made it clear on
the bleachers where I stood.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:09:59.863
You did.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:04.534
So I heard about
Cameron and Movement.

01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:07.454
You got a plan yet?

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.415
You're lookin' at it.

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:12.292
Well I made some
phone calls today,

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.128
and I was able to buy
us some more time.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.421
Us>

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:17.923
Yes.

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:20.133
Gavin, I'm here, aint I?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.802
For how long?

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.721
As long as it takes.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:26.765
Listen, Faith, I'm
not taking your money.

01:10:27.015 --> 01:10:28.242
Gavin, I don't even
have enough money

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.644
to do what I'm
gonna propose we do.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:32.646
What did you have in mind?

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:35.148
We're not just
gonna make payments.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.275
We're gonna pay it off.

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:45.367
So like I said, we're
gonna save Movement Church.

01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:47.869
You're supposed ask me how.

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:51.122
Okay, I'll play along.

01:10:51.373 --> 01:10:52.415
How?

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:55.085
This place is
gonna be packed out.

01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.671
For a Faith Winters concert.

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:00.131
Seriously?

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:01.382
Yeah.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:04.135
Why?

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:06.763
I mean, why would you do that>

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.307
Gavin, don't you remember>

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:12.644
15 years ago, right
here, you told me that

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:14.562
you believed in me.

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:17.440
Yeah.

01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:19.567
So what do you think?

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:23.947
I think you don't
have to do this.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.783
Hey, I'm not doin' anything.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.033
We are.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.115
A good man aint worth
nothin' without a bunch of...

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.832
Good women holdin' him up.

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:36.001
Gavin, you've done
a lot for Smithville,

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:38.336
and it's time you
let us do our part.

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.588
Dad, I'm so sorry.

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:44.467
I didn't realize how much
pressure you were under.

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:46.469
All right, girls.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.389
Let's give him a little preview.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.702
Howdy Gavin.

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:11.952
Hey.

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:13.078
What ya up to>

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:14.331
I'm just thinkin'.

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:15.623
Thinkin'.

01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.514
Well, Annie sent me
over here to make sure

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:20.628
that you aren't thinkin' too
hard or stressing yourself out

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:22.756
or overworkin' yourself.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.091
So, I think it's my
duty to take you out

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:26.676
and do somethin' fun.

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.721
Listen, I, I'd love to.

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:33.058
I would, but...
Well then let's go.

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:35.393
I've got so much goin'
on with Movement right now.

01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:38.355
I've got Zoe who's sneaking
out of the house at night.

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:39.665
I'm trying to be a good father,

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.929
I'm trying to be a good pastor,

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:44.986
and I just can't seem to
get everything done well.

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:48.031
And, listen, if I had more time.

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:50.909
I understand.

01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:52.159
I do.

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:58.708
Look, Gavin, I, I know I'm
not some big star or anything,

01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:04.881
but, I promise you that
I'll be a good friend.

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:10.553
Listen, if there's anything
that you need, at all,

01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:13.640
I'm your girl.

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:17.352
I appreciate that.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:18.686
Absolutely.

01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:19.955
Don't work yourself
too hard now.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:20.979
All right.

01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:21.648
You have a good night.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.358
You, too.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:40.708
Hey Faith.

01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:41.960
Her Miranda.

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.729
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:47.590
Uh, listen, I think you
ought to know he's here.

01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:48.841
Who>

01:13:50.135 --> 01:13:51.136
Oh.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:53.304
Cameron's here.

01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:54.097
Okay.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:55.390
Sorry.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.700
Well, thanks for
the heads up, girl.

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:57.964
I think he's up by the stage.

01:13:58.143 --> 01:13:59.144
Okay.

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:01.437
Fabulous.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.155
Is that your homework>

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:12.030
No.

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.199
It's my song book.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:14.451
Oh.

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:17.829
That would explain
why it looks so worn.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.289
Are you ready>

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:21.958
What do you think?

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:25.086
I think you're
gonna blow 'em away.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.504
I'm nervous.

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:30.967
There's so many
people out there.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.470
And, they're all watching me.

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:37.182
Remember that promise
I made you when you

01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:38.892
first came home with us?

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:41.478
That no matter
where life took you,

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:43.396
you'd never be alone?

01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:45.606
Go.

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:47.108
Perform.

01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:49.235
You were born for this.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.070
Okay>

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.825
I'll see you out there.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:57.075
All right.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.544
You ready?

01:15:06.794 --> 01:15:09.672
Man, I haven't had these
butterflies in years.

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:12.383
But I've never been more ready.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:15.303
I'm kind of scared.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.114
Hey, you know how
they always say to just

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:20.016
imagine the audience
in their underwear?

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:21.266
Don't do that.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:23.186
It'll just make you laugh.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.438
You're gonna be just fine.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.815
We got you, Z.

01:15:28.066 --> 01:15:29.710
I say we give 'em
what they came here for.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:31.986
- Let's do it.
- All right.

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:36.616
How y'all doin'?

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.910
I said how y'all doin'?

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160
There we go.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.830
My name's Gavin Whitfield.

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:44.624
I'm the pastor at
Movement Church.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.585
I wanna sincerely thank
you all for coming out.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:49.605
I wanna thank you in
advance for your donations

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:51.631
as your donations will
help us better serve you

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.092
at Movement, and I also
wanna welcome my daughter

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:57.303
Zoe Whitfield to
the stage to, uh,

01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:59.222
go ahead and sing one for us.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:00.932
Let's hear it.

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.096
Faith.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.892
Hey listen, I just
wanted to say thank you,

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.977
for doing this, I mean,

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:30.897
I couldn't do it without you.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:33.399
Faith, we're ready
for you right now.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.152
I got to go.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:06.808
All right.

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:09.936
Y'all give it up
for Zoe Whitfield.

01:18:14.774 --> 01:18:18.194
Let me guess, you're not a
big Faith Winters fan, huh>

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:19.444
Hardly.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:21.781
Really>

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:23.700
Eh, she's all right.

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:25.827
I've heard better.

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:27.346
Well it's really
good to see y'all.

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:28.639
We're really excited to be here,

01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:30.665
but I really wanted
to introduce to y'all

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:32.195
a couple of
beautiful ladies here

01:18:32.417 --> 01:18:33.543
with me tonight.

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:37.922
Um, y'all give it up for the
super talented Zoe Whitfield.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:46.514
And, y'all give it up for
my inspiration and momma,

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:48.224
Miss Liz Winters.

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:56.129
Thank y'all for
comin' out tonight,

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:58.234
we appreciate it for
such a great cause,

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:03.072
and we're gonna get on with
what we came here to do.

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:14.644
Um Gavin>

01:20:14.894 --> 01:20:16.395
Hi, I don't believe we've met.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.022
Hi, I'm sorry.

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:19.273
Vanessa Hill.

01:20:19.524 --> 01:20:20.817
Faith's publicist.

01:20:21.067 --> 01:20:21.609
Um.

01:20:21.859 --> 01:20:23.277
Ex-publicist.

01:20:23.528 --> 01:20:24.528
It's a long story.

01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:27.782
I'll spare you the
gruesome details.

01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:31.202
Let's just say I'm
forging a new path.

01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:34.121
I'm starting my own label.

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:35.372
Yeah.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.589
So Zoe, she's your
daughter, right?

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.299
She is, yeah.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:47.301
That girl's a star.

01:20:47.552 --> 01:20:48.302
I mean, I don't know if
you know it or not yet,

01:20:48.553 --> 01:20:50.513
- but she is.
- Oh, I know.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.323
I just don't know if
I wanna believe it.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:56.269
A star's gonna shine
whether you want it to or not.

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:53.992
Listen.

01:21:55.328 --> 01:21:57.622
I heard about Cameron was
trying to do to your church,

01:21:57.872 --> 01:21:59.641
and however much extra it
is to cover the costs of

01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:01.918
the church and the
land, I wanna pay for it

01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:03.544
or find someone who can.

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:05.522
No, no, no, no, you
don't have to do that, no.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:07.381
Just Gavin, stop.

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:10.426
Okay, look, Faith told
me all about you and

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:13.137
in some round about way,

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:17.141
I feel like you're
responsible for my success.

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:22.897
You know, that girl
did everything she did

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:25.900
because she knew
you would see it.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:30.863
That was awesome.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:31.864
Great job.

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:33.282
I'll be right back.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:35.177
I have to go get my notebook.
Okay, all right.

01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:37.495
You are beautiful, beautiful.

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:39.246
Thank you.

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:40.497
That was so good.

01:22:40.665 --> 01:22:41.248
- Good to see you.
- You too.

01:22:41.499 --> 01:22:42.208
You remember my mom.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:43.458
Could I forget you>

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:44.126
No.

01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:45.419
Vanessa.

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.838
Thank you for everything
you've done for Faith.

01:22:48.089 --> 01:22:49.858
My gosh, please, what
about everything Faith's

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:50.549
done for me>

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.385
You should take my number.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:55.179
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.102
Looks like Cameron's had enough.

01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:03.980
Yeah, I'll be right back.

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:06.065
Careful with that one.

01:23:10.236 --> 01:23:11.236
Cameron.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:14.365
You know what, Faith, I get it.

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:15.926
Your stupid little
Footloose town likes to take

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:17.535
care of their own.

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:19.870
I won't take their property.

01:23:21.414 --> 01:23:22.641
No, you can't admit
defeat to something you

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:23.749
already lost.

01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:26.251
Maybe.

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:28.796
But you could have been a star.

01:23:29.046 --> 01:23:31.757
No Cameron, I could
have been myself,

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:35.553
and clearly that wasn't
good enough for you.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.806
But it's good enough for me.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:49.150
All right, well, I
guess I'm gonna do

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.818
a song for y'all.

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:53.696
Um, I know it's been
quite a bit of a shock

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:55.990
to see me back in Smithville.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.242
I know maybe some of
you might not have been

01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:02.955
too happy to see me, but, I
was really happy to see you.

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:04.373
Since I was a little girl,

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:07.793
I've just been in
love with daisies.

01:24:08.044 --> 01:24:11.172
And, uh, as beautiful as
they are, it takes many years

01:24:11.422 --> 01:24:14.425
for their roots to
grow strong and deep.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:19.638
And, I just realized that
I've spent most of my life

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:22.200
puttin' down roots
and pullin' 'em up

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:25.061
at the first sign
of danger or change,

01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:28.272
or a challenge, or commitment.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:31.484
And, uh, I've decided I'd
really like to plant myself

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:34.403
here for a few seasons
and see how high

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:36.447
I can grow with you.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.092
This song is about
that, it's called.

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:41.077
"Runnin' From My Roots."

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:05.451
How are you?
