09:12.927 --> 09:14.095
and it's awesome,

09:14.178 --> 09:16.472
'cause he's doing
all these projects with Jason,

09:16.556 --> 09:19.976
and it's amazing
that we're both in the same industry.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.019
Oh, my God, look at the fireworks!

09:22.103 --> 09:23.563
[both exclaim]

09:23.646 --> 09:25.231
That's for our date.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.274
You did that for me?

09:26.357 --> 09:27.692
Yeah. I organized that.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.694
[Mary laughs] I love it.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.945
We have to have a kiss.

09:36.075 --> 09:36.909
I love you.

09:36.993 --> 09:37.994
I love you, baby.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.538
-[server] The bone marrow.
-Thank you.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.956
[Romain] That's what's up.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.165
-[Mary] Perfect.
-Thank you.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.084
God damn, I'm starving.

09:45.167 --> 09:50.006
So I think it would be a good idea
to try to figure out, like…

09:50.923 --> 09:53.342
where we're at on this whole buying thing.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.428
Our whole plan was to flip.

09:55.511 --> 09:59.724
I know it's, like, a super hard thing
to do right now with you so busy,

09:59.807 --> 10:02.059
but of course, with me and this industry,

10:02.143 --> 10:04.312
and then you and the construction too,

10:04.395 --> 10:08.357
we have the potential
to make a shit ton of money from it.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.651
So I think it would be good
to find something

10:10.735 --> 10:13.446
where we redo the kitchen,
the bathrooms, the floors,

10:13.529 --> 10:16.240
not plumbing,
electrical, roof, foundation.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.201
Just like the cosmetic things
that have big bang for your buck.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.661
Mm-hmm.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.623
I just think we need
to talk a bit more about it

10:23.706 --> 10:25.958
because it's important
for me to do my part,

10:26.042 --> 10:28.377
and you, you know,
obviously, you can do yours.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.295
[chuckles]

10:29.337 --> 10:31.130
But until we find something…

10:32.214 --> 10:35.217
-I just, I also… This is our future.
-But I understand…

10:35.301 --> 10:36.469
I don't want to miss out

10:36.552 --> 10:38.471
-on a great opportunity.
-I don't want to either.

10:38.554 --> 10:41.849
I just wanna find something
that works for both of us

10:41.932 --> 10:44.310
because the way I've been raised,
I don't expect anyone

10:44.393 --> 10:45.603
to pay for any of my shit.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.939
Even though you're my wife and I love you.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.275
You wanna do half and half,

10:51.359 --> 10:55.446
but if I find something that is amazing,

10:55.529 --> 11:00.284
and you're not ready yet
or not able to put money into that home,

11:00.368 --> 11:04.121
I want to be able
to jump in, get it for us.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.581
Absolutely not!

11:07.083 --> 11:10.628
[Romain] I wanna be proud of myself,
and say, you know, "I did it."

11:10.711 --> 11:13.798
If Mary pays for everything,
even if we put both of our names,

11:13.881 --> 11:15.007
there is no point for me.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.592
I'll never be happy with that.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.344
I'm happy and proud of you.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.514
It's just important for me
to do my part of things.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.140
I mean, I respect that.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.936
That's one of the things I love about you,
but I don't want us to miss out.

-Yeah, it can be.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.803
I was at Brett's listing the other day.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.514
There was Mary and Davina and Emma,

12:03.597 --> 12:05.975
and they were talking about Christine,

12:06.058 --> 12:11.480
and all the things that she said to Emma,
that she was engaged to this guy.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.898
Mary said that's not true.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.900
She was friends
with Christine at that time.

12:14.984 --> 12:18.863
Even Davina, she's starting
to have doubts of what she's saying.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.991
She's getting caught in her lies,
and everyone's just sick of it.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.160
This isn't the only situation like that.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.455
I feel that Christine comes
from a place of pain,

12:27.538 --> 12:30.374
and she probably just, like, uses

12:30.458 --> 12:34.128
her behavior as a defense
of not being hurt again.

12:34.211 --> 12:39.300
What is the pain that would make you
try and truly tear people down

12:39.383 --> 12:42.261
and take them down
at the worst time in their life?

12:42.344 --> 12:44.764
I think Christine comes
from a place of jealousy,

12:44.847 --> 12:49.143
and she just is driven
by what feels like evil forces.

12:49.226 --> 12:52.354
I understand
your situation with Christine,

12:52.438 --> 12:54.857
but also, like,
I believe that people can change.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.527
So I had this idea of…

12:58.611 --> 13:01.572
I have a mindset coach,
and she has helped me tremendously,

13:01.655 --> 13:05.826
so I felt it would be a good idea
for her to meet her

13:05.910 --> 13:08.913
and improve her life
and become a better person.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.624
I started seeing this mindset coach,

13:11.707 --> 13:13.834
uh, after my sister died,

13:13.918 --> 13:16.545
and she helped me a lot
to reframe my thoughts

13:16.629 --> 13:19.799
when they were going to a negative place,

13:19.882 --> 13:22.760
so I really think
that she can do the same for Christine.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.763
[chuckles] I don't know
what kind of healer you have,

13:25.846 --> 13:28.682
but unless you have
some kind of a guru healer

13:28.766 --> 13:31.268
that's gonna sit her down
and do an exorcism,

13:31.352 --> 13:33.354
I don't see how this is going to change.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.731
Uh…

13:35.815 --> 13:38.734
I don't think Christine
is capable of being saved,

13:38.818 --> 13:42.696
but Vanessa wants
to take Christine to a mindset coach.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.532
[inhales sharply]

13:44.615 --> 13:46.367
It's worth a shot. [chuckles]

13:47.159 --> 13:48.619
I want to be honest with you.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.955
I don't know if you're upset with me

13:51.038 --> 13:52.832
because I'm friends with her.

13:52.915 --> 13:53.916
Why do you say that?

13:53.999 --> 13:54.959
I feel that…

13:55.042 --> 13:58.170
I think there's been like a shift, um,

13:58.254 --> 14:01.590
between… I don't know,
between you and me. And I don't know…

14:01.674 --> 14:03.759
No, truly, that is not the case.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.221
I want you to know that I don't wanna
not be friends with her,

14:07.304 --> 14:10.724
but also, like, I will not stop
being friends with all of you,

14:10.808 --> 14:13.811
because she doesn't get along
with all of you.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.646
Uh…

14:15.729 --> 14:18.482
You don't have to worry about what I…

14:18.566 --> 14:21.402
Like, me worried about talking to you and…

14:21.485 --> 14:24.363
Just because, honestly,
every single thing I just said to you,

14:24.446 --> 14:25.865
I would say to her face.

14:25.948 --> 14:30.119
This is truly where I stand,
and it's taken me a long road to get here.

14:30.202 --> 14:34.373
So this isn't a kind of conversation
where I'm nervous that you're--

14:34.456 --> 14:37.751
-No, I'm not saying it because of that.
-I would say this to her.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.704
[Mary] Oh, okay.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.497
So what's been going on with you?

15:15.581 --> 15:18.959
Nothing. [laughs]
The kids are good. They're so opposite.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.962
Noah always wants to leave the house,
go do something,

15:22.046 --> 15:25.215
and then Braker,
I cannot get him out of the house.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.800
Oh, yeah? Video games?

15:26.884 --> 15:31.138
Video games, and then he gets annoyed
with, like, people like a lot.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.598
-I get that.
-Just annoyed.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.309
It's really tough to know
what to say to the kids

15:35.392 --> 15:38.395
'cause I don't want
to tell them he's not coming back.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.066
Braker asked me the other day,
"Can I change my last name to Smith?"

15:42.149 --> 15:44.109
-Really?
-He goes, "Since my dad left."

15:44.193 --> 15:46.070
-Oh!
-And I was like--

15:46.153 --> 15:48.948
-Wow.
-"Um… maybe." [chuckles]

15:49.031 --> 15:51.158
I think that because it's been so long,

15:51.241 --> 15:54.328
they've pretty much
come to the conclusion on their own

15:54.411 --> 15:55.829
that maybe he isn't.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.164
And I think it's time

15:57.247 --> 15:59.541
that we just really focus
on the three of us

16:00.125 --> 16:01.627
and just try to move on.

16:01.710 --> 16:06.632
Well, you're killing it
in a really crappy situation.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.010
[Amanza] Anywho,
what's going on with real estate?

16:10.094 --> 16:12.388
People still selling houses
at the Oppenheim Group?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.431
[Mary] They are, yeah. It's going well.

16:14.515 --> 16:18.310
Romain's back in OC today.
He's down there doing Jason's house.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.145
Jason bought a house in…

16:20.229 --> 16:22.356
-Yeah.
-Dude buys house every other week.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.024
-I can't keep up.
-I know.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.069
So Romain's fixing that one up,
but it'll be a short project

16:27.152 --> 16:28.362
'cause it's already nice.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.738
-Where is it?
-Newport.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.240
-Oh, my gosh, wow.
-Yeah.

16:31.323 --> 16:36.495
But, I mean, we're good. We're just like…
I feel like we can't make any plans

16:36.578 --> 16:38.872
because we barely have time to talk.

16:38.956 --> 16:43.002
We have, like, a couple minutes
of conversation, eat, and he falls asleep

16:43.085 --> 16:46.088
'cause he has to get up
at 5:00 a.m. to go back to work, so…

16:46.171 --> 16:49.341
Are you guys going to keep renting
or you want to buy something?

16:49.425 --> 16:50.300
We want to buy.

16:50.384 --> 16:54.013
I just don't know
what we're going to do just yet

16:54.096 --> 16:56.348
because he wants to pay at least half.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.726
I'm trying to figure out
how to get around that.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.478
[Amanza] That's a tough…
I mean, even as a woman,

17:01.562 --> 17:05.649
it's a tough spot to, like, not feel
like you're contributing at least half.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.693
-Yeah.
-So for a man, it's--

17:07.776 --> 17:09.194
-Exactly.
-…ten thousand times…

17:09.278 --> 17:12.740
Even though you don't care.
Like if he wasn't working, but he…

17:12.823 --> 17:16.076
I would have a serious problem
if he was if he wasn't working.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.455
Then I'd be like,
"Uh, I'm not your sugar mama."

17:19.538 --> 17:21.874
I've been up and down,

17:21.957 --> 17:24.001
and more down, in my life

17:24.084 --> 17:27.212
than anything when it comes to finances.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.215
I mean, being a single mom since I was 16,

17:30.299 --> 17:35.554
I had to kind of start over again
many times for many reasons,

17:35.637 --> 17:38.307
and I never want to go through that again.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.976
I'm making great money for myself,

17:41.060 --> 17:43.937
and I feel very secure,
and security means a lot to me.

17:44.021 --> 17:48.192
I'm watching Chrishell buy her house
and Heather and Tarek just bought a house,

17:48.275 --> 17:50.277
and Jason buys like 25 houses.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.195
Yeah.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.114
In the Valley right now,
the prices are going up so fast.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.991
-We're gonna miss the boat.
-I know!

17:56.075 --> 17:58.243
The Valley used to be
the affordable place.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.788
It's hot
and it's not as close to the city,

18:00.871 --> 18:03.665
but now it's just as high
as everywhere else.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.294
Maybe something will pop up
that's just like, "Wow!"

18:07.377 --> 18:09.963
And he's like,
"Dude, I get it. We can't miss out."

18:10.047 --> 18:12.674
Maybe you could
work out something with him

18:12.758 --> 18:15.594
because, honestly, if you do buy a fixer…

18:15.677 --> 18:18.972
-Mmm.
-…he's gonna be doing most of the labor.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.309
That's something you would've
had to pay for that wouldn't be free.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.227
Exactly.

18:23.310 --> 18:27.022
Maybe, "Look, you are contributing
way more than you probably even know."

18:27.106 --> 18:29.191
I understand Mary's frustration.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.901
She wants to buy a house,

18:30.984 --> 18:34.363
but money is one
of the leading causes of breakup,

18:34.446 --> 18:36.907
and I really hope
that they can work through this,

18:36.990 --> 18:40.160
because I just don't want
to see them, you know, crumble.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.539
I asked Braker the other day,
"Who's your favorite uncle?"

18:44.164 --> 18:46.583
-And he said Romain.
-Aw!

18:46.667 --> 18:49.545
I was like, "We won't tell
Uncle Brett or Uncle Jason."

18:49.628 --> 18:51.338
-[both laugh]
-Aw, that's so sweet.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.800

so it makes sense. [laughs]

19:23.620 --> 19:27.499
So, Laura, she's an amazing mindset coach.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.837
I think that she's a gift that Jackie,
my sister, sent me when she passed.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.090
She has helped me tremendously
with everything in my life,

19:35.174 --> 19:38.677
and, uh, I'm really happy you're here
because I want to help you.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.012

19:40.095 --> 19:42.347
-Thanks for having me. I'm excited.
-Hold on.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.641

-[Laura] Good or bad?

19:44.725 --> 19:46.393
-[screams and laughs]
-What?

19:46.476 --> 19:48.896
-Oh, my God! I can't believe it!
-[Christine] What?

19:48.979 --> 19:50.439
I fell out of escrow

19:50.522 --> 19:52.566
and I called my other backup offer,

19:52.649 --> 19:56.904
and I got an offer now for $1,650,000.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.657
Seven days, no contingencies,
like, no referrals, no nothing.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.793
So that's $351,000 over asking!

20:11.877 --> 20:14.046
[Christine] What? Oh, my God!

20:14.129 --> 20:16.298
[Vanessa] No,125,000 more
than the other one!

20:16.381 --> 20:18.425
-[Christine] Oh, my goodness.
-You held the bar.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.843
-Oh, I did!
-Mindset.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.678
Yay! [cheers]

20:21.762 --> 20:24.306
Oh, my God. Okay,
clearly, you're really good, so…

20:24.389 --> 20:25.724
[Vanessa] Yes, she is.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.644
We just sat down and this lady
is already making things happen.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.270
I need her in my life.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.189
So I just help people manifest

20:32.272 --> 20:35.567
or close the gap between where they are
and where they wish to be,

20:35.651 --> 20:39.321
versus spewing and stuckedness
of whatever they think their problems are,

20:39.404 --> 20:41.031
and then make it happen.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.659
It's been hard with relationships.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.911
That's what I have the problem with.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.287
And for me,

20:47.371 --> 20:50.290
I'm in a situation
where I just feel, like, alienated.

20:50.374 --> 20:55.337
And I want to move forward
with all these girls,

20:55.420 --> 20:58.966
and I just feel
like they don't really seem

20:59.049 --> 21:02.469
to either want to move forward
or know how to move forward.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.931
A lot of these girls were like,
"You did these things to me years ago,

21:06.014 --> 21:08.892
and you need to apologize
for the stuff you did years ago,

21:08.976 --> 21:11.186
and then this,
you did that, and years ago."

21:11.270 --> 21:13.272
And so, for me, I was just like…

21:13.355 --> 21:15.065
I did apologize,

21:15.148 --> 21:18.860
but I cannot keep harping on old things.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.238
So that's where I feel like I'm stuck.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.115
-Can I say something?
-Yeah.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.075
The problem I see right now

21:25.158 --> 21:28.203
is that they say
that you're continuing doing it.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.582
That you apologize
and you continue doing something else,

21:32.666 --> 21:35.168
and it's completely the opposite
of what you say.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.879
And that is where they're coming from,

21:37.963 --> 21:39.339
according to what they say,

21:39.423 --> 21:42.801
and they're all agreeing
that you continue lying.

21:42.884 --> 21:46.847
I mean, I'm so sorry they feel that way,
but that's certainly not the case.

21:46.930 --> 21:50.350
I would never feel comfortable
with people saying that I'm lying.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.562
I don't need to defend myself anymore.
That's what's gotten--

21:53.645 --> 21:57.065
Okay, but how do you see
that they're going to believe in you

21:57.149 --> 21:58.608
if you don't stop this?

21:59.192 --> 22:03.030
I've always been trying to explain,
trying to explain, trying to explain,

22:03.113 --> 22:05.073
and I don't wanna do it anymore.

22:05.574 --> 22:09.661
It's beyond disrespectful to my husband.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.579
Yeah.

22:10.662 --> 22:14.041
This is a relationship
that started eight years ago.

22:14.124 --> 22:18.003
But I feel that it's important
for you to feel at peace with this,

22:18.086 --> 22:20.505
and I don't feel
that you are really at peace with it.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.133
And that's what's been hurting me
since day one,

22:23.216 --> 22:25.218
that I've seen you suffering about this.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.137

22:28.638 --> 22:30.057

[dramatic music playing]

22:34.936 --> 22:36.104
[sobs]

22:36.188 --> 22:38.565
You do really need to let this go,

22:38.648 --> 22:41.777
and then really, like,
close the door to drama.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.571
Once and for all.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.116
[Laura] You gotta look at yourself
in the mirror and recognize

22:48.200 --> 22:52.329
"There's a part of me that is done
with blaming everybody else,

22:52.412 --> 22:54.998
because when I make the excuse
that it must be them,

22:55.082 --> 22:57.209
I'm handing the keys of my power to them."

22:58.043 --> 23:01.755
Whether you had a tough situation,
maybe when you were a child or a teenager,

23:01.838 --> 23:05.175
that stripped you of your power,
and it manifested in a friendship.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.052
[Christine] I just…

23:08.428 --> 23:09.388
I mean, like…

23:10.639 --> 23:11.473
[sighs]

23:12.557 --> 23:13.558
[Laura] It's okay.

how she has this mind coach for Christine.

but I'm looking for a listing
up to 12 million.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.170
Damn!

28:34.254 --> 28:36.965
Somewhere in West Hollywood,
Beverly Hills, Bel Air.

28:37.048 --> 28:41.428
Think about something you guys would like.
Your style, for a man in his fifties.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.889
I'm sorry, in his fifties?
I don't know that style.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.558
We are not close to 50.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.560
You're close. You only got a few years.

28:48.643 --> 28:49.936
[Chrishell] Hi, guys.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.772
-Oh, I love this color on you.
-Thank you.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.608
[Chrishell] Oh, my gosh.
I have so much activity on this house.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.861
-[Emma] Hello!
-[Heather] Hi!

28:57.944 --> 29:00.613
Oh, my God. We're twinning.
I have that exact outfit.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.449
We have to wear it the same day.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.492
-Cute.
-Hi! How are you?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.119
Oh, my eye hurts.

29:06.703 --> 29:10.749
I think I do need your eye drops, Mary,
but I think I need help putting them in.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.125
Ooh, I can help you!

29:12.208 --> 29:14.836
-I'm really good.
-Really? I'm really sensitive right now.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.422
I think I'm so tired and sleep deprived.

29:17.505 --> 29:20.300
I'm so tired.
I woke up and my eye started bothering me.

29:20.383 --> 29:21.426
[gasps] I'm scared!

29:21.509 --> 29:22.635
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.763
-Ready?
-[Emma laughs]

29:25.305 --> 29:26.431
This is fun. Okay.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.101
-I got it in there.
-Thank you, Nurse Chrishell.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.937
I'd like to see you
in a nurse outfit next time, please.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.732
[Emma] I can picture you
in a nurse outfit, for sure.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.734
-Hello, hello!
-Hi!

29:37.817 --> 29:40.361
-[Heather] Hey! I love this.
-[all greet]

29:40.445 --> 29:42.572
Thank you, my love. How are you?

29:42.655 --> 29:44.324
Where's Maya and Amanza?

29:44.407 --> 29:45.700
They're both really sick.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.701
Really?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.703
It's like COVID, but it's not COVID.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.706
[Chrishell] Oh, my gosh.
This is a very L.A. e-mail.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.875
"I have a celebrity couple
who are very interested

29:53.958 --> 29:56.002
in taking a look at your new listing."

29:56.085 --> 29:58.630
"I know you have an open house
set for 11 to two tomorrow,

29:58.713 --> 30:01.549
but would it be possible
to have a private showing at 2 p.m.?"

30:01.633 --> 30:05.094
Why, yes, it will be possible.
Let me Google your clients.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.137
[Emma] Exactly!

30:06.221 --> 30:08.264
[Mary] How did your showing with Simu go?

30:08.348 --> 30:11.810
[Chrishell] Everything he was asking for.
More than he wanted to spend.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.521
[Mary] You'll find something.
There'll be a better house.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.357
[Jason] On that note, guys,
let's have a team meeting.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.943
We can catch up on everything.
Chrishell, you'll start.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.695
I love team meetings. I do.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.198
Smaller group today.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.534
File in, ladies.

30:28.034 --> 30:28.910
[Jason sighs]

30:29.536 --> 30:31.287
Oh, my God, I just…

30:32.038 --> 30:35.834
[gasps] Look at this! I just got
the most exciting text message.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.711
-Sorry, I know we haven't started yet.
-I can see it!

30:38.795 --> 30:42.298
Um, "As expected,
my clients love the property."

30:42.382 --> 30:45.134
"I don't know
what we have to do to get it,

30:45.218 --> 30:49.305
but I will be writing an aggressive offer
in the next 24 hours."

30:49.389 --> 30:51.975
-[all cheer]
-A big round of applause for Chrishell!

30:52.058 --> 30:53.017
[agents] Yay!

30:53.101 --> 30:56.771
Oh, my God,
I love the term "aggressive offer."

30:56.855 --> 30:59.148
This is Thomas Bryant, my NBA client.

30:59.232 --> 31:02.819
It was Jordan Clarkson,
the basketball player on the Lakers,

31:02.902 --> 31:04.195
sold it to Thomas Bryant.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.739
-Keep it in the basketball family.
-[Chrishell] Same team.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.992
-[Jason] Yeah, on the Lakers together.
-Yeah.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.244
-I'm starting to know basketball.
-[all laugh]

31:11.327 --> 31:13.371
-She's not learning basketball.
-[laughs]

31:13.454 --> 31:17.458
She watched five minutes of one game.
We gotta move on. I can't deal with this.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.127
Okay, I'm out. Next, next.

31:19.752 --> 31:23.965
I've got a bit of good news.
So I will be sending you guys invitations.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.593
I'm going to have an event
at my house next week.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.136
I want you guys all to come,

31:28.219 --> 31:31.264
the whole company there,
because I've got a big announcement,

31:31.347 --> 31:34.058
and I want everyone,
like, just full cocktail attire.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.228
Like, I've got DJ, bartender.
It's gonna be a very nice event.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.730
-What?
-That sounds fun but--

31:38.813 --> 31:40.607
[Emma] What is the announcement?

31:40.690 --> 31:42.817
I'm gonna make
the announcement at the party.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.862
-[Mary] Not gonna give us hints?
-You're getting married?

31:46.654 --> 31:47.572
[all laugh]

31:47.655 --> 31:50.742
There'll be a lot of people.
I'll announce it when everyone's there.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.660
I want all of you ladies there, okay?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.037
What?

31:54.120 --> 31:57.165
[Mary] I have no idea
what this surprise could be.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.042
Normally he tells me everything.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.960
I'm clueless, so…

32:01.044 --> 32:04.005
I'm looking forward to finding out
just like everybody else.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.841
I'm proud of everyone here.
You're all doing really well.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.177
It's unfortunate
we weren't all here together.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.054
Maya's sick, Amanza's sick.

32:11.137 --> 32:14.390
-Do you know where is Christine?
-[Brett] She was invited here.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.477
We thought she was going to come today.
She didn't, so…

32:17.560 --> 32:18.978
Honestly, I don't know.

You like his little Gucci shirt?

32:31.032 --> 32:33.201
Yeah, it's cool. Nothing but the best.

32:33.701 --> 32:36.496
Oh, my God. I look so MILF-y today.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.789
-[laughs]
-You are.

32:37.872 --> 32:42.043
[Christine] So have you been looking
anymore at new houses in OC?

32:42.126 --> 32:45.922
[Christian] Yes. Prices are actually
a lot higher than here in West Hollywood.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.549
-Mm-hmm.
-Um, but it's the most beautiful beach.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.219
I think it'd be
a beautiful weekend house for us,

32:51.302 --> 32:53.388
and it's an hour away from where we live.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.430
It's a no-brainer.

32:54.514 --> 32:58.101
-Plus, I'm just so fed up in the office.
-Yeah? What's going on?

32:59.018 --> 33:02.438
Every time I walk into work,

33:02.522 --> 33:05.441
they go out of their way to ignore me.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.903
People don't realize how difficult it is

33:08.987 --> 33:11.197
to walk into a room…

Mm-hmm.

33:12.198 --> 33:15.284
…of people who hate you.

33:15.368 --> 33:19.080
You know the thing that really hurt me
is Heather said,

33:19.163 --> 33:23.251
"Well, I hope that Christine
becoming a mother," you know,

33:23.334 --> 33:24.877
"it'll soften her."

33:24.961 --> 33:26.796
[Christian] I hope so too. [laughs]

33:28.131 --> 33:29.590
You don't want me to be soft.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.552
You want me to have an ass
you can crack an egg on.

33:32.635 --> 33:36.180
Oh, you're talking about personality.
That's never gonna soften up, no.

-[Heather] Vanessa has news.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.896
Oh, guys, I'm so happy, so excited.

33:43.980 --> 33:47.734
You remember my Pacific Palisades
Malibu Village house?

33:47.817 --> 33:49.527
I received two offers.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.445
[all] Yay!

33:50.528 --> 33:54.032
[Vanessa] And then they started
like, you know, in a war. [laughs]

33:54.115 --> 33:55.575
And I open my e-mail,

33:55.658 --> 33:57.869
and it was a million-650,

33:57.952 --> 34:01.039

34:25.188 --> 34:26.814
[Heather] Yeah!

34:26.898 --> 34:28.232
Oh, wow!

34:28.316 --> 34:31.611
[Christine] It's hard because,
you know, even Vanessa,

34:31.694 --> 34:34.072
she hangs out with me,
and we have a great time,

34:34.155 --> 34:36.574
and then she goes
and hangs out with the other girls,

34:36.657 --> 34:38.367
and all they do is bad-talk me

34:38.451 --> 34:41.162
and say really nasty things,
and, you know, and…

34:41.245 --> 34:43.247
Yesterday we went to Malibu,

34:43.331 --> 34:45.917
and she introduced me
to this great manifestation coach,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.295
and it was really nice,
it was really liberating.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.588
Mm-hmm.

34:50.671 --> 34:53.549
The mindset coach helped me see

34:53.633 --> 34:55.593
that how I feel

34:55.676 --> 34:56.928
and how I'm perceived

34:57.011 --> 34:58.805
is in my own control.

34:58.888 --> 35:02.975
I do want to change my relationships
with the other agents moving forward.

35:03.059 --> 35:06.521
I think it's just been too long
that they've been holding on to grudges,

35:06.604 --> 35:08.356
and it's not healthy for them.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.316
And I would just like to move on

35:10.399 --> 35:12.276
and I wish they could too.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.821
-I mean, that's just jealousy.
-[chuckles] I mean…

35:14.904 --> 35:16.447
Whenever people are nasty,

35:16.531 --> 35:19.325
it's basically hurt projected out,
so they're jealous.

35:19.408 --> 35:20.993
-Yeah.
-Look at your life.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.120
-I know.
-Right?

35:22.203 --> 35:24.914
Isn't one of them divorced,
like, dumped, basically?

35:24.997 --> 35:26.916
-Yeah.
-And thrown out, so like…

35:26.999 --> 35:29.794
So here we are,
happily married with our baby.

35:29.877 --> 35:33.840

that they'll never do their entire life.
