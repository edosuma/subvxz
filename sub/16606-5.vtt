What are you doing here?

00:01.163 --> 00:03.421
What if we finally could give us a shot?

00:03.446 --> 00:04.483
_

00:04.508 --> 00:06.609
I had this app that I was
trying to get going, but...

00:06.633 --> 00:08.164
Wait. A for real app?

00:08.219 --> 00:09.952
You need to still do that.

00:09.977 --> 00:12.709
Guess who got into The League.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.381
I thought you were feeling Jared.

00:14.413 --> 00:16.108
I just wanna see what else is out there.

00:16.146 --> 00:19.295
Look, Jared, I'm just not looking
for a relationship right now.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.783
You wanna be friends now?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.000
Okay, okay.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.562
Hey, hey, real quick, y'all
wanna know who can spit?

00:24.711 --> 00:26.671
- Kids: What?!
- No.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.523
For real y'all. In fact, she just killed
it at an open mic a few weeks ago.

00:29.555 --> 00:31.203
- They don't need to know all that.
- I found it!

00:53.718 --> 00:55.668
It's so stupid.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.230
Yeah, but, like, funny stupid.

01:01.017 --> 01:04.019
Wait, was... was this
the night that we...?

01:05.062 --> 01:06.602
I had had a few drinks

01:06.647 --> 01:09.517
and, uh, I just needed
to blow off some steam.

01:09.567 --> 01:12.147
Well, look,

01:12.195 --> 01:14.615
yo, yo, I know you used
to rap in high school,

01:14.655 --> 01:16.035
but it's weird seeing you like this.

01:16.073 --> 01:17.653
It was a mistake, okay?

01:17.700 --> 01:19.530
I never thought this
would see the light of day.

01:19.577 --> 01:22.617
- It's not that bad.
- Not that bad, Lawrence?

01:22.663 --> 01:25.623
Middle school kids have seen
me rapping about pussy smells.

01:25.666 --> 01:28.818
For the rest of their lives, they're
gonna associate pussy smells with me!

01:28.843 --> 01:31.966
Well, you did find a way to
rhyme "loosey" with "poosie."

01:32.006 --> 01:34.176
You're basically
teaching them Shakespeare.

01:35.484 --> 01:38.507
Lawrence, this is embarrassing, okay?

01:38.554 --> 01:40.094
I need the kids to take me seriously

01:40.139 --> 01:42.099
and this completely undermines that.

01:42.141 --> 01:43.851
They're kids, all right?

01:43.893 --> 01:47.143
Look, they'll have fun with
it for a couple of hours

01:47.188 --> 01:50.228
and then forget about
it after the weekend.

01:53.611 --> 01:55.611
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.655 --> 01:57.905
Broken pussy!

Hey, Miss Issa! Look what I made.

02:12.421 --> 02:13.961
Uh, I am so sorry.

02:14.006 --> 02:15.386
I didn't even know this was out there.

02:15.411 --> 02:16.886
Issa, I know this is rough and...

02:16.911 --> 02:19.049
- And maybe...
- It's had enough!

02:19.095 --> 02:21.435
Shh! Shh.

02:21.472 --> 02:23.972
Believe me, I am mortified.

02:24.016 --> 02:25.936
- Okay? I will fix this.
- Thank you.

02:25.977 --> 02:28.536
Because Julio is starting
to teach it in Spanish.

02:31.148 --> 02:32.858
Spanish, though?

02:39.949 --> 02:42.909
- Mm.
- Oh, it's Monday already?

02:42.952 --> 02:46.625
I know. The weekend
went by way too fast.

02:57.049 --> 03:00.009
Flavor Flav, off!

03:03.406 --> 03:05.026
Damn dog.

03:05.683 --> 03:07.143
You know, I gotta go home anyway.

03:07.184 --> 03:09.024
I can't go to work in jeans.

03:09.061 --> 03:11.271
Well, next time, you'll just
have to bring an extra suit.

03:11.314 --> 03:14.734
Yeah, I should carry a garment
bag around with me on dates.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.086
Or you could just leave one here.

03:17.512 --> 03:19.023
Uh-huh.

03:21.949 --> 03:23.819
So, what are you up to tonight?

03:23.868 --> 03:26.335
Uh, that all depends.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.292
Are we gonna finish what we started?

03:29.332 --> 03:31.542
Actually, my friend
Diane's having a party.

03:31.584 --> 03:33.504
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

03:33.544 --> 03:36.294
Yeah, she just got engaged,
so she's celebrating that.

03:36.339 --> 03:37.880
Wanna come?

03:38.194 --> 03:41.325
Uh, can we play it by ear?
I got a lot going on at work.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.232
Yeah, of course... of course, yeah.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.373
It should be pretty nice, though.
It's gonna be at Hatchet Hall.

03:46.625 --> 03:49.844
- Okay. I'll try my best.
- All right.

03:51.057 --> 03:54.094
I should probably let Diane
know if I'm bringing a plus one.

03:56.108 --> 03:58.478
Okay, put me on the list.

03:58.527 --> 03:59.857
Okay.

04:01.656 --> 04:03.866
- See you tonight.
- All right.

04:20.341 --> 04:22.261
One, two...

04:22.301 --> 04:24.301
What are you gonna do?

04:24.345 --> 04:26.225
Where are you gonna go?

04:26.263 --> 04:29.553
Everybody's laughing
at you, a female Bozo.

04:30.135 --> 04:32.220
You can go and hide

04:32.269 --> 04:34.229
or you could try to fix it.

04:35.523 --> 04:37.103
Go get all your tools together.

04:37.149 --> 04:39.359
Get on your mechanic.

04:51.001 --> 04:52.875
- Damn!
- Right?

04:52.915 --> 04:55.045
And now the kids at school
are talking about it.

04:55.084 --> 04:56.656
And if it gets back to my boss,

04:56.681 --> 04:58.462
who the fuck knows what she's gonna do?

04:58.504 --> 05:01.424
- And, girl, I got memed.
- What?

05:01.465 --> 05:03.175
Yeah. I just don't have
time for this right now.

05:03.217 --> 05:05.217
Okay, okay, wait, wait,
wait. Just slow down.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.091
How did the kids find
it in the first place?

05:07.138 --> 05:09.388
Daniel! He was talking about
what a great rapper I was

05:09.432 --> 05:11.511
and... and the kids must've googled me,

05:11.536 --> 05:13.768
the stupid, smart-as-fuck,
researching-ass kids.

05:13.811 --> 05:14.966
Mm.

05:14.991 --> 05:16.941
Uh-uh, don't give me
the auntie "mm," okay?

05:16.981 --> 05:19.271
- I'm the victim here.
- Oh, you're the victim?

05:19.316 --> 05:22.986
This video was recorded without
my knowledge or my consent.

05:23.029 --> 05:24.529
It's basically rap rape.

05:24.572 --> 05:26.362
Okay, well, technically,
it was my pussy,

05:26.407 --> 05:29.697
so if anybody's gonna blow the
rap rape whistle, it would be me.

05:29.744 --> 05:33.874
Look, I just need you to be my lawyer

05:33.968 --> 05:36.546
and threaten the shit out of
the person who posted this video.

05:36.584 --> 05:39.504
- Are they refusing to take it down?
- I don't know who posted it!

05:39.545 --> 05:41.303
Then who I'ma threaten, Issa?

05:43.466 --> 05:45.637
All right, who else
was there that night?

05:47.629 --> 05:48.880
Mm.

05:48.905 --> 05:51.456
Daniel might know who posted it, okay?

05:51.481 --> 05:53.246
He knew hella people who
were there that night.

05:53.271 --> 05:55.522
All right, so there's no other
person who was there who could help?

05:55.561 --> 05:57.431
Not the bartender, not the emcee

05:57.480 --> 05:59.770
or any other nigga you haven't
carried a fuck torch for?

05:59.815 --> 06:01.655
Bitch, I don't... I
don't care about him!

06:01.692 --> 06:03.856
Okay? I just wanna get
this video taken down

06:03.881 --> 06:05.925
before it ends up on WorldStar.

06:07.573 --> 06:10.868
All right, well, let
me see how I can help.

06:10.893 --> 06:13.534
I'll call Jared. His brother
performed at Maverick's that night.

06:13.579 --> 06:15.989
Thank you, seriously.

06:26.926 --> 06:29.812
- Oh, you gotta work?
- Yes, bitch, I'm a real-ass lawyer.

06:30.846 --> 06:32.146
Okay.

06:40.678 --> 06:42.057
- So?
- Nah.

06:42.108 --> 06:44.478
- Damn it!
- I checked with the manager and the DJ.

06:44.527 --> 06:45.874
Nada.

06:46.654 --> 06:47.702
What am I gonna do?

06:47.727 --> 06:49.404
Listen, let me just
make some calls, okay?

06:49.448 --> 06:51.448
No, it's fine. It's not on you.

06:51.492 --> 06:55.001
It is, though. Shit, I should've
never told the kids you rapped.

06:56.892 --> 06:58.832
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure it out.

06:58.874 --> 07:01.454
I'ma find out who put
that shit up and ghost it.

07:05.059 --> 07:07.839
I gotta be at the studio
in 20. Can you drop me off?

07:07.883 --> 07:09.184
Hey.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.356
I got you.

07:19.728 --> 07:21.018
- Yes.
- So, he's fat?

07:21.063 --> 07:23.353
- Yes, he's fat. Very.
- Whatever.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.149
Not big-boned, fat.

07:25.192 --> 07:27.942
- Yes, sir.
- You're stupid.

07:28.310 --> 07:29.727
Damn.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.570
Roscoe's got some talent.

07:31.615 --> 07:33.271
Hey, I'm getting married, man.

07:35.138 --> 07:37.410
- Shut the fuck up, man.
- No, for real this time.

07:37.454 --> 07:38.966
Leah's it, brah.

07:41.208 --> 07:43.787
Wow. Yo, how long
y'all known each other?

07:43.812 --> 07:45.060
Not that long.

07:45.271 --> 07:46.710
It's crazy, though, man.

07:46.755 --> 07:48.730
The one day, I'm getting
the girl a deal on a loft,

07:48.755 --> 07:50.464
next, I'm getting engaged,
moving into that loft,

07:50.509 --> 07:53.339
and realizing it has some
real structural problems.

07:53.387 --> 07:56.308
Shit. Yo, congratulations, man.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.598
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

07:57.641 --> 08:00.471
Brah, she's got me doing crazy shit.
She want me to meet the parents.

08:00.722 --> 08:02.231
I drove her to the airport.

08:05.274 --> 08:07.364
- Why you laughing?
- Yeah. It's crazy.

08:07.401 --> 08:08.941
- Yeah.
- It's crazy.

08:09.196 --> 08:12.866
- Yo, how'd she make the cut?
- She's special.

08:14.074 --> 08:15.962
You know, man, when you know, you know.

08:16.744 --> 08:18.164
Plus the head is crazy.

08:18.204 --> 08:19.874
What about you and the old girl?

08:19.914 --> 08:22.164
- Oh, we good.
- For real?

08:22.899 --> 08:24.998
Last time I talked to you, you told
me you didn't give a fuck about her.

08:25.044 --> 08:27.084
No, I told you I fucked up her birthday.

08:27.129 --> 08:29.709
- That's kind of the same thing, though.
- Seriously, man.

08:29.757 --> 08:33.509
I mean, we went through some
shit, but... we in a good place.

08:33.552 --> 08:35.381
So, what's taking you so long?

08:35.756 --> 08:37.667
I'm still getting my shit together.

08:37.811 --> 08:38.975
Yeah?

08:39.342 --> 08:41.764
Nigga, why don't you get
your shit together-together?

08:41.789 --> 08:43.412
That's what I told Leah.

08:43.437 --> 08:45.767
We're gonna handle her divorce
and our prenup at the same time.

08:45.978 --> 08:47.976
It's just good time management.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.076
- What?
- What's up with your hair, though?

08:51.101 --> 08:53.318
We need to get this
shit fixed. I got a guy.

08:53.343 --> 08:55.443
- I'm not fucking going.
- It's a little off on the corner, man.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.569
- The corner's off.
- My hair is fine.

08:56.617 --> 08:57.907
It's right there, man.

08:57.952 --> 08:59.162
Yep, right there.

09:01.872 --> 09:03.912
- Hey.
- Hey!

09:03.958 --> 09:06.078
It's been a minute. How you doing?

09:06.636 --> 09:08.284
Just busy working.

09:08.347 --> 09:09.920
- Just...
- Mm-hmm.

09:09.964 --> 09:12.424
So, what's up?

09:12.466 --> 09:14.266
You remember Issa?

09:14.301 --> 09:16.881
Well, someone shot a video of her
rapping that night at Maverick's,

09:16.929 --> 09:18.679
and now she might get in trouble for it.

09:18.722 --> 09:20.762
But I remember your brother
performed that night,

09:20.808 --> 09:23.745
so maybe he might know who posted it.

09:23.909 --> 09:25.982
Yeah, maybe. I'll ask him.

09:26.021 --> 09:28.101
Thank you.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.793
That's what friends are for.

09:33.851 --> 09:36.437
So, was that all you
called me for or...?

09:36.490 --> 09:40.593
It was, but it's really
good to hear your voice.

09:41.245 --> 09:43.015
You should hear it in person.

09:44.081 --> 09:45.394
Is that Chris?

09:47.167 --> 09:49.792
- Chris? Oh.
- Fuck.

09:50.152 --> 09:52.885
- He sounds friendly.
- Yeah, he, um...

09:52.923 --> 09:55.633
yeah, no, it's, um... I
mean, it's not, you know...

09:57.324 --> 09:58.445
Relax, yo.

09:58.470 --> 10:00.895
- I'm just fucking with you.
- I know!

10:00.931 --> 10:04.511
And I'm fucking back, yeah.

10:05.569 --> 10:07.454
Ha.

10:08.939 --> 10:10.229
I'll talk to my brother.

10:10.274 --> 10:11.524
All right. Have a good one.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.727
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:16.655 --> 10:20.115
- I am so sorry. Who was that?
- It was Jared.

10:20.159 --> 10:22.489
And can you stop playing
Who's Molly on the Phone With?

10:22.536 --> 10:25.336
- 'Cause you're pretty bad at it.
- Yeah, I suck at guessing.

10:25.372 --> 10:26.832
Idiot.

10:26.874 --> 10:28.504
Yeah, that's what he told me.

10:28.542 --> 10:31.962
No, man, I'm just... are you sure?

10:33.505 --> 10:36.635
All right. Thanks anyway.

10:36.675 --> 10:39.635
- Come on, guys.
- Fuck!

10:40.846 --> 10:43.894
- This is what the fuck I get.
- For what?

10:43.919 --> 10:45.816
Why'd I have to go up on that stage?

10:45.851 --> 10:48.271
This... this is why I don't do shit.

10:48.312 --> 10:50.833
- This isn't me.
- Are you kidding? That's all you.

10:51.107 --> 10:56.109
All right? You gotta go for shit
like that, and you were good.

10:58.447 --> 10:59.687
Yeah?

10:59.740 --> 11:01.303
Yeah.

11:02.368 --> 11:04.717
- You feel better?
- No.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.872
Why don't you come in for a second?

11:08.916 --> 11:11.336
You don't need to be driving
all stressed out, all right?

11:11.377 --> 11:14.327
Just come in, wait out the traffic.

11:20.301 --> 11:23.609

11:53.494 --> 11:55.663
You want the wheel with chairs on it?

11:56.444 --> 11:59.588
Uh, so... no, I'll...
I'll just sit right here.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.577

how ignorant I've been

14:30.993 --> 14:33.033
about the drug cartel in Mexico.

I always thought it was
about a girl named Sicario,

15:48.320 --> 15:50.145

Oh, no. I thought we
were on the same page.

Oh, I'm s... what... what page was that?

15:56.953 --> 15:58.833
I was just trying to help.

15:58.872 --> 16:00.952
By pretending to be my boyfriend?

16:00.999 --> 16:03.079
No. Well, kind of.

16:03.126 --> 16:05.636
It just seemed like tonight
was really important to you,

16:05.671 --> 16:07.631
and I didn't want you to be embarrassed.

16:07.673 --> 16:10.763
Uh, this is embarrassing.

and don't take this the wrong way...

16:16.167 --> 16:18.037
you really needed a win.

16:19.701 --> 16:22.314
- Because I'm a loser?
- No! I... I meant that...

16:22.354 --> 16:25.303
You think I'm so pathetic that
I needed you to come and save me?

16:25.328 --> 16:28.691
You're the one who was asking
me to come. Like, repeatedly.

16:28.735 --> 16:30.115
But I did not ask you to lie.

16:30.153 --> 16:31.783
We barely even know each other

16:31.822 --> 16:34.652
and you're talking about me
leaving clothes at your spot,

16:34.700 --> 16:36.860
making plans six months in advance.

16:36.910 --> 16:38.731

16:41.581 --> 16:43.032

- Hey, hey.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.372
I almost didn't recognize
you without your name tag.

17:19.411 --> 17:22.400
Oh, I mean, I clean up okay.

17:24.682 --> 17:26.212
Oh.

17:26.251 --> 17:29.131
You need to come do this at the bank.

17:29.492 --> 17:31.862
Oh, I just got bored.

17:31.887 --> 17:35.750
Well, then it's a good thing I came by.

17:37.846 --> 17:40.976

rid of your old computer?

- Mm-hmm.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.732

17:58.492 --> 18:00.872

18:00.911 --> 18:02.581

and margaritas at Islands.

18:24.282 --> 18:26.862

18:29.231 --> 18:31.811
Right. Yeah.

18:31.858 --> 18:33.438
I mean, I just thought that...

18:33.485 --> 18:35.485
- No, that's...
- That's all right.

18:35.529 --> 18:37.689
Yeah, uh, I'll just see you later.

18:38.005 --> 18:39.365
Cool.

18:39.825 --> 18:41.575
- Okay.
- All right.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.540
- Same time tomorrow?
- Yeah, man.

18:51.586 --> 18:53.796
- Good job today, though.
- Hey, appreciate it.

18:53.839 --> 18:55.589
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Oh, y'all, too.

18:55.632 --> 18:57.512
Good night, boo. Later, boy.

18:59.023 --> 19:00.841
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

19:01.232 --> 19:03.177
I should probably go, too.

19:03.223 --> 19:05.263
For... for what? I just got done.

19:05.308 --> 19:07.638
Oh, yeah, no, it's just getting
late and I figured I might as well...

19:07.686 --> 19:09.429
Then come on, sit down.

19:09.938 --> 19:12.999
Let me, uh... let me
have a drink with you.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.748
Yeah, okay.

19:25.252 --> 19:27.875
- Oh, shit!
- Aw, shit! My fault.

19:27.914 --> 19:29.704
Yeah, no. I'm stupid and clumsy.

19:29.749 --> 19:31.249

wanna hear the fuck out of this.

I mean, yeah, you know, we
were long distance and shit,

23:31.116 --> 23:33.496
- but you never took me serious.
- We were friends with benefits!

23:33.543 --> 23:38.343
Because you wanted to go do
your thing out in the streets.

23:39.416 --> 23:41.178
Yeah, okay, so it's on you.

23:41.209 --> 23:42.828
How is it on me?

23:43.086 --> 23:46.046
Now you're trying to make me
feel a way on purpose, huh?

23:46.089 --> 23:49.729
You... you're really gonna
act like you don't know?

23:50.713 --> 23:53.854
Okay, do you remember the summer
when I came home from college?

23:53.879 --> 23:56.179
Mm, when you were hella
obsessed with Danity Kane?

23:56.224 --> 23:59.854
- Liked, nigga. I liked Danity Kane.
- Yeah.

23:59.894 --> 24:03.354
Anyway, you were the first
person I wanted to see.

24:03.895 --> 24:06.228
And then remember we spent
the whole day together?

24:06.276 --> 24:08.486
Mm, right. We had tacos
from three different trucks.

24:08.528 --> 24:11.148
Yes, because you couldn't remember
which spot had that sauce you liked,

24:11.197 --> 24:13.897
and then it ended up being
basic-ass Jack in the Box.

24:13.950 --> 24:16.782
Jack in the Box goes
hard for breakfast stuff.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.753
And then when I was driving home,

24:23.793 --> 24:26.923
you called me back over and...

24:29.574 --> 24:32.134
I thought you were
gonna say you wanted to,

24:32.177 --> 24:36.183
I don't know, make things official.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.465
You know, give us a shot.

24:39.276 --> 24:41.486
But you didn't.

24:43.961 --> 24:45.580
I should have.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.112
I wanted to.

24:52.530 --> 24:56.070
I mean, maybe you're right.

24:56.117 --> 24:58.987
Maybe... maybe I wasn't ready then.

25:05.454 --> 25:08.386
- Well, you should've said something.
- I know.

25:10.365 --> 25:11.589
I know.

25:14.541 --> 25:16.408
What if I'm ready now?

25:22.685 --> 25:25.985
I... I...

25:28.328 --> 25:29.491
Hmm.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.857
Shit.

26:23.251 --> 26:24.345
You good?

26:24.370 --> 26:25.990
Black and yellow, black and
yellow, black and yellow.

26:26.015 --> 26:27.345
Okay.
