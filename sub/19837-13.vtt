02:27.970 --> 02:30.290
<b>I'm doing fine.</b>

02:32.490 --> 02:35.960

02:35.960 --> 02:37.230
<b>Isn't that great?</b>

02:38.170 --> 02:42.010
<b>But it's been a tough ride.</b>

<b>First, after leaving the island,</b>

<b>the boat I was on ran into a big storm.</b>

02:56.130 --> 03:00.860

03:08.160 --> 03:09.660
<b>That's three times now.</b>

03:10.710 --> 03:11.970
<b>Step outside.</b>

03:12.700 --> 03:16.110
<b>I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline,

<b>How many times must I repeat myself?</b>

03:42.670 --> 03:44.490
<b>You should show me some respect.</b>

03:44.490 --> 03:46.780
<b>I won't back down.</b>

03:48.190 --> 03:49.410
<b>Then I have no choice...</b>

03:59.880 --> 04:01.010
<b>Damn it!</b>

04:14.070 --> 04:15.560
<b>Thanks, Gon!</b>

04:16.110 --> 04:17.940

04:24.540 --> 04:26.180
<b>Thank you very much!</b>

04:28.080 --> 04:30.080
<b>No, you don't need to thank me.</b>

<b>Well...</b>

04:33.280 --> 04:35.080
<b>Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.</b>

04:35.410 --> 04:39.340

04:54.240 --> 04:55.330
<b>We sound like strangers...</b>

04:55.760 --> 04:58.110
<b>Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.</b>

05:00.050 --> 05:01.580
<b>I'm also sorry.</b>

05:02.800 --> 05:05.470

<b>You can only rescue one.</b>

06:13.420 --> 06:15.940
<b>We gave the right answer.</b>

06:15.940 --> 06:19.060
<b>Silence was the correct response.</b>

<b>How can you tell that I'm

06:51.590 --> 06:52.800
<b>Huh?</b>

06:52.800 --> 06:54.850
<b>Your face is completely different.</b>

06:55.340 --> 06:59.000
<b>And your voice is a little

07:05.360 --> 07:06.160
<b>What?</b>

07:06.160 --> 07:08.610
<b>Did I say something funny?</b>

<b>I'm twelve years old.</b>

08:18.180 --> 08:19.650
<b>Hmm...</b>

08:19.650 --> 08:21.180
<b><i>We're the same age.</i></b>

08:21.180 --> 08:22.180

08:25.360 --> 08:27.060
<b>Guess I'll run, too.</b>

08:27.060 --> 08:27.940
<b>Wow!</b>

08:27.940 --> 08:29.280
<b>That was cool!</b>

08:30.470 --> 08:31.400
<b>I'm Killua.</b>

08:31.720 --> 08:32.900
<b>I'm Gon.</b>

08:35.870 --> 08:38.450
<b>Hey, why do you want to 
become a Hunter?</b>

08:39.070 --> 08:40.170
<b>Me?</b>

08:40.170 --> 08:42.210
<b>I'm not really interested in 
becoming a Hunter.</b>

08:42.210 --> 08:42.710
<b>Huh?</b>

08:43.440 --> 08:45.870
<b>I heard the exam was supposed 
to be really hard,</b>

08:45.870 --> 08:48.020
<b>so I thought it'd be fun.</b>

08:48.530 --> 08:50.210
<b>But this is disappointing.</b>

08:51.460 --> 08:52.680
<b>What about you?</b>

08:52.680 --> 08:56.010
<b>Well, my dad's a Hunter.</b>

08:56.010 --> 08:59.590
<b>So I want to become a Hunter,

08:59.590 --> 09:00.690
<b>Hmm...</b>

09:00.690 --> 09:02.330
<b>What kind of Hunter is he?</b>

09:02.330 --> 09:03.500
<b>I don't know.</b>

09:05.590 --> 09:07.290
<b>That's kinda weird.</b>

09:07.290 --> 09:08.200
<b>Really?</b>

09:08.200 --> 09:10.020
<b>You want to be like your dad,</b>

09:10.020 --> 09:12.690
<b>but you don't know anything about him?</b>

09:13.040 --> 09:16.360
<b>I was raised by Mito-san,</b>

09:16.360 --> 09:18.800
<b>so I've only seen my dad in pictures.</b>

09:18.800 --> 09:20.720
<b>Who's Mito-san?</b>

09:20.720 --> 09:21.700
<b>Aunt Mito.</b>

09:21.700 --> 09:23.140
<b>Oh...</b>

09:23.140 --> 09:26.830
<b>When he was twelve, 
my dad took the Hunter Exam.</b>

09:27.570 --> 09:29.840
<b>He passed and became a Hunter.</b>

09:29.840 --> 09:31.710
<b>Then he left the island.</b>

09:32.560 --> 09:34.970
<b>I want to find out why he 
chose to be a Hunter</b>

09:34.970 --> 09:36.720
<b>over being with me.</b>

09:39.720 --> 09:41.210
<b>The exit!</b>

<b>Whew...</b>

09:49.480 --> 09:52.190
<b>Goal!</b>

09:55.420 --> 09:57.420
<b>Yay! I win!</b>

09:57.420 --> 09:58.530
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

09:58.530 --> 09:59.910
<b>I was faster...</b>

10:04.120 --> 10:06.940
<b>Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.</b>

10:06.940 --> 10:10.190
<b>If you can take this ball from me,</b>

10:10.190 --> 10:14.460
<b>before the airship reaches

10:25.970 --> 10:27.940
<b>It's mine!</b>

10:43.910 --> 10:46.910
<b>I commend you on your efforts.</b>

<b>Not bad, little boy.</b>

11:34.590 --> 11:36.340
<b>Is that a fishing pole?</b>

11:36.680 --> 11:38.920
<b>What a fascinating weapon.</b>

11:41.050 --> 11:43.180
<b>Allow me a closer look.</b>

11:43.180 --> 11:45.210
<b>Your fight is with</b>

13:08.640 --> 13:10.810
<b>Grow up and become a fine Hunter.</b>

<b>Huh?</b>

15:08.060 --> 15:09.000
<b>What?</b>

15:12.970 --> 15:16.830

18:14.380 --> 18:15.940
<b>I win!</b>

18:20.490 --> 18:22.220
<b>How are we settling this contest?</b>

18:22.220 --> 18:23.500
<b>Contest?</b>

18:23.500 --> 18:25.450
<b>I believe you're confused.</b>

18:26.180 --> 18:30.320
<b>This will be a one-sided massacre.</b>

18:30.320 --> 18:33.960
<b>I have no interest in the exam 
or any offer of amnesty.</b>

18:33.960 --> 18:37.470
<b>I just want to hear you scream.</b>

18:37.470 --> 18:39.620
<b>Really? Okay.</b>

18:39.620 --> 18:41.510
<b>Then the loser is the one who dies.</b>

18:41.510 --> 18:44.540
<b>Yeah, that's right.</b>

18:46.370 --> 18:52.080
<b>I'll tear your body apart.</b>

19:13.500 --> 19:15.150
<b>That's...</b>

19:16.080 --> 19:18.390
<b>mine.</b>

19:20.360 --> 19:22.500
<b>G-Give it back.</b>

19:36.790 --> 19:39.700
<b>Please select a path.</b>

19:39.700 --> 19:41.200
<b>There are two choices.</b>

19:41.840 --> 19:43.150
<b>One path allows five to pass,</b>

19:43.150 --> 19:44.840
<b>but is long and difficult.</b>

19:44.840 --> 19:47.650
<b>The other path allows only three,</b>

19:47.650 --> 19:49.740
<b>but is short and easy.</b>

19:53.300 --> 19:55.170
<b>I'm going to press O.</b>

19:55.830 --> 19:59.050
<b>We made it all the way here together.</b>

19:59.050 --> 20:00.510
<b>I want us all to pass together.</b>

20:00.880 --> 20:01.980
<b>Gon...</b>

20:01.980 --> 20:04.250
<b>Even if it's a big risk,</b>

20:04.250 --> 20:06.260
<b>I want to give it a shot!</b>

20:18.070 --> 20:20.390
<b>We entered the long and difficult path.</b>

20:20.390 --> 20:22.380
<b>Then cut a hole in the wall,</b>

20:22.380 --> 20:25.280
<b>to sneak into the short and easy path.</b>

20:32.940 --> 20:34.790
<b>My butt hurts...</b>

20:35.510 --> 20:37.510
<b>I didn't expect a slide</b>

20:37.510 --> 20:39.630
<b>for the short and easy path.</b>

20:40.420 --> 20:42.640
<b>Three of them...</b>

20:43.430 --> 20:45.180
<b>Thirty seconds remain.</b>

20:45.180 --> 20:47.680
<b>That was really close.</b>

20:48.200 --> 20:49.980
<b>My hands are covered with blisters.</b>

20:49.980 --> 20:51.560
<b>Same here.</b>

20:52.660 --> 20:56.310
<b>Leorio, applicant #403, 
is the twenty-third to pass.</b>

20:57.330 --> 20:58.820
<b>My hands are blistered,</b>

20:59.180 --> 21:01.670
<b>but all five of us cleared 
the tower together.</b>

21:02.190 --> 21:04.510
<b>All thanks to Gon!</b>

21:08.530 --> 21:10.790
<b>The Third Phase of the exam is over.</b>

21:10.790 --> 21:13.110
<b>Twenty-five applicants have passed.</b>

21:13.600 --> 21:16.580
<b>One has died.</b>

21:20.980 --> 21:22.190
<b>"And so,</b>

21:22.190 --> 21:26.590
<b>I've completed the exam's 
Third Phase, Mito-san.</b>

21:27.140 --> 21:30.790
<b>I don't know how many are left,</b>

21:31.370 --> 21:33.800
<b>but I'll pass them all</b>

21:33.800 --> 21:36.560
<b>and become a Hunter, just like Dad.</b>

21:37.000 --> 21:38.610
<b>Until next time,</b>

21:39.120 --> 21:40.870
<b>Gon Freecss."</b>

21:48.210 --> 21:50.680
<b>Ging, your son is following</b>

21:50.680 --> 21:53.650
<b>in your footsteps.</b>

21:56.020 --> 21:57.250
<b>Well?</b>

21:57.250 --> 21:58.550
<b>Are you happy?</b>

23:28.880 --> 23:31.050
<b>Next time: Hit x The x Target!</b>

23:31.050 --> 23:32.550
<b>Be sneaky like Hisoka!</b>

23:32.550 --> 23:33.760
<b>Hit and run.</b>
