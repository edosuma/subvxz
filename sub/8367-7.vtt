00:14.280 --> 00:15.260
Jonah?

00:15.440 --> 00:16.500
What's the problem, Pete?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.720
Mitchell got arrested.

00:19.070 --> 00:19.930
What for?

00:20.440 --> 00:22.050
Well, we grabbed a couple horses

00:22.050 --> 00:25.940
you know, from one of those ranches
outside of town and Mitchell got caught.

00:25.940 --> 00:28.240
Well... Mitchell is an idiot.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.510
But the thing is...

00:31.860 --> 00:33.900
the ranch that we were at,

00:34.416 --> 00:36.033
it belonged to Johnston Green.

00:37.970 --> 00:40.869
The mayor's wife kind of got
knocked around a little bit.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.768
Not bad, though. Nothing bad.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.964
But... wait a minute.

00:47.807 --> 00:48.701
Wait a minute.

00:50.768 --> 00:53.222
Who's idea was it, yours or his?

00:53.227 --> 00:54.163
It was his.

00:55.875 --> 00:56.883
I'm sorry.

00:57.487 --> 00:58.610
I apologize.

00:59.547 --> 01:00.723
I apologize.

01:05.407 --> 01:06.653
Apology accepted.

01:18.417 --> 01:22.112
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes

01:22.577 --> 01:26.932
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes

01:27.288 --> 01:30.322
--She'll be coming 'round...
--Knock it off, Mitchell.

01:33.056 --> 01:33.980
Where's Jake?

01:36.245 --> 01:37.522
You better go get him,

01:38.578 --> 01:39.663
'cause when Jonah comes for me,

01:39.667 --> 01:41.963
he's gonna want to have a little
conversation with Jake.

01:43.285 --> 01:44.173
If he has to go looking for him

01:44.177 --> 01:46.162
it's going to make things a whole lot worse.

01:46.168 --> 01:47.053
Whatever.

01:47.385 --> 01:48.493
Just keep it down in here, all right?

01:48.655 --> 01:50.091
Better tell him to get ready.

01:50.617 --> 01:51.623
In fact...

01:53.566 --> 01:54.850
you all better get ready.

01:58.216 --> 01:59.030
Right.

02:04.905 --> 02:05.803
Mallo Cups.

02:06.745 --> 02:08.840
--That's what they were called.
--God, I love those.

02:08.848 --> 02:11.852
--The best.
--I always got so much more
candy than you, remember?

02:11.895 --> 02:13.062
'Cause you cheated.

02:13.618 --> 02:15.452
You'd trick or treat the whole neighborhood in one costume,

02:15.458 --> 02:17.170
then you'd go do it again in another.

02:17.726 --> 02:19.360
Come on, Eric, everybody did that.

02:19.945 --> 02:21.070
Well, except for you.

02:22.045 --> 02:23.873
Jake and I had Halloween down to a science.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.953
I was always the bag lady so I could
stuff all of his costumes into my garbage bad.

02:28.505 --> 02:31.113
I think we hit the Stevens' house,
like, seven times in one year.

02:31.927 --> 02:33.950
He did always share s haul with me, though.

02:35.257 --> 02:37.112
Just like a little Bonnie and Clyde.

02:37.437 --> 02:38.523
So adorable.

02:42.897 --> 02:46.312
Is it inappropriate that I keep
asking questions about him?

02:46.318 --> 02:47.643
Why would it be inappropriate?

02:48.178 --> 02:49.221
I don't know.

02:51.807 --> 02:53.433
Do you have a thing for Jake?

02:53.675 --> 02:54.453
No...

02:56.556 --> 03:00.052
--Okay, except, maybe, yes, just a little bit.
--A little.

03:00.608 --> 03:03.182
--I'm sorry, this is really weird.
--It's not weird.

03:03.185 --> 03:06.310
Look, it wasa long time ago.
Just be careful, okay?

03:06.515 --> 03:07.250
Why?

03:07.957 --> 03:11.341
There's a lot of things about
Jake you don't know, okay?

03:17.675 --> 03:18.621
Is that Jake's car?

03:24.987 --> 03:27.022
--Oh, my God.
--What?

03:31.685 --> 03:32.493
What is it?

03:39.717 --> 03:41.423
--Good morning.
--Morning.

03:42.085 --> 03:46.480
--Can I help... you?
--I'm here to see about posting
bail for a friend of mine.

03:47.198 --> 03:48.462
Mitchell Cafferty.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.720
Hello, Jonah.

03:56.206 --> 03:57.172
Jake.

03:58.776 --> 03:59.982
Been a long time.

04:12.606 --> 04:14.541
5 years. So...

04:15.095 --> 04:18.281
--I understand Mitchell's been causing some trouble.
--Come on, don't act surprised.

04:18.285 --> 04:20.682
He doesn't get out of bed in the morning
without running it by you first.

04:20.687 --> 04:21.930
I'm not sure that's true,

04:22.675 --> 04:23.912
but I'm here to bail him out.

04:24.618 --> 04:26.132
All right, then let's talk bail.

04:26.358 --> 04:29.161
--First you're going to give back
the food you stole...
--Wait, hold on a second.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.370
I'm not sure you've noticed,

04:30.377 --> 04:31.852
but the world's coming apart at the seams.

04:31.858 --> 04:35.012
What belongs to who is getting
to be a fuzzy science, Jake.

04:36.498 --> 04:39.080
--But I'll see what I can do.
--All right, and  then you're
gonna stay away from this place.

04:39.086 --> 04:43.411
--Not just you-- Mitch, Joe Kelly...
--Since when are you in a position
to speak for this town?

04:43.486 --> 04:46.063
--Do we have a deal?
--Shut up, Mitchell!

04:49.335 --> 04:50.463
We have a deal.

05:00.855 --> 05:02.331
Oh, I see you're awake.

05:02.588 --> 05:03.402
Must be noon.

05:03.885 --> 05:05.163
I've been up for a while.

05:05.447 --> 05:06.482
Hey, close the front door.

05:06.485 --> 05:07.923
What, were you born in a barn?

05:09.288 --> 05:10.720
Were you born in a barn?

05:11.036 --> 05:13.950
Almost a week you've been here and that
joke's really not getting any funnier.

05:15.088 --> 05:17.250
Found some stale corn flakes in the pantry.

05:17.258 --> 05:19.641
--Since no one else seemed to be eating them...
--Well, knock yourself out.

05:19.647 --> 05:22.523
Here, you want a little milk with those?

05:23.627 --> 05:24.870
There you go.

05:30.675 --> 05:31.523
Oh...

05:31.525 --> 05:32.660
It's still warm.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.751
Yeah, it was even warmer when it
was in the cow ten minutes ago.

05:34.758 --> 05:37.941
--And that will do it for the corn flakes.
--Mm...

05:40.057 --> 05:41.803
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

05:42.198 --> 05:43.201
Yes, I did.

05:44.105 --> 05:46.141
--By the way, where's the funnel?
--Oh, yeah.

05:46.465 --> 05:48.052
I  put it in the random drawer.

05:51.345 --> 05:54.133
I couldn't sleep last night, so I rearranged
some kitchen space

05:54.135 --> 05:56.691
put all the nonessentials out of the triangle.

05:57.307 --> 06:00.691
--Triangle?
--The workspace that connects the three critical areas--

06:00.895 --> 06:02.563
sink, stove and prep.

06:02.956 --> 06:05.573
I was in the process of having my condo in D.C.

06:05.578 --> 06:07.403
renovated before I got stranded here.

06:07.407 --> 06:08.193
You know, Mimi,

06:08.628 --> 06:09.942
when  I was a young boy growing up,

06:09.945 --> 06:12.400
I always felt like there was something
missing in my life.

06:13.308 --> 06:14.252
Now I know.

06:14.445 --> 06:15.603
It was the triangle.

06:16.118 --> 06:17.472
Sink, stove, prep.

06:18.025 --> 06:20.393
We have sarcasm in D.C., you know.

06:24.286 --> 06:25.372
These'll do, Bob.

06:29.988 --> 06:32.690
Please tell me that's diet Cream soda.

06:33.046 --> 06:34.932
There used to be a whole case of diet here.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.950
Gracie promised she'd hold on to it for me.

06:37.076 --> 06:38.130
Not to worry, dear.

06:38.135 --> 06:40.423
I tucked it away when we agreed on the price.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.571
Oh, you're right.

06:45.576 --> 06:47.802
--It's  lovely.
--It's an antique.

06:49.488 --> 06:51.593
Are you sure about this, sweetheart?

06:53.505 --> 06:54.601
I'm sure.

06:55.156 --> 06:58.660
Dale, there's a case of soda hidden
along the back wall next to your cot.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.250
Would you bring it up, please?

07:00.487 --> 07:01.841
You're still sleeping here?

07:03.797 --> 07:04.883
Be right back.

07:14.038 --> 07:15.932
--What are you doing?
--What?

07:15.936 --> 07:20.063
--You were cooling your thermometer
in that glass of water, weren't you?
--No, I wasn't.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.543
All right, so what if I was?

07:23.545 --> 07:25.323
I'm fine. I'm tired of being babied.

07:25.407 --> 07:28.113
You have a temperature of 350 degrees.

07:28.117 --> 07:29.593
You are going to rest.

07:29.988 --> 07:32.432
You are going to take
the pills that April gave you.

07:32.435 --> 07:36.010
You are going to admire this
ridiculous pumpkin with me

07:36.017 --> 07:39.481
and then we are going to try to eat said
pumpkin together.

07:39.488 --> 07:43.060
Because we use every part
of the buffalo in this house.

07:43.685 --> 07:46.093
--Is that understood?
--Most of it.

07:47.455 --> 07:48.443
But no more meds.

07:48.445 --> 07:49.490
It's been three weeks,

07:49.495 --> 07:52.621
I'm not going to be the reason
this town runs clean out of antibiotics.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.060
All right, now you listen to me.

07:56.590 --> 07:59.519
There may come a day when this town needs you
to be a hero again

08:00.337 --> 08:03.488
but today is not that day.

08:07.183 --> 08:08.194
The world's changing.

08:08.625 --> 08:09.830
Don't I know it.

08:10.105 --> 08:12.673
Not a lot of work for a guy
hauling freight these days.

08:13.037 --> 08:15.753
The old side business has sort of become
a full time gig.

08:16.587 --> 08:17.901
We could use a guy like you out there.

08:17.907 --> 08:20.501
There's a lot of stuff out on the roads
waiting for anybody to take it.

08:21.287 --> 08:22.301
I want your word.

08:22.856 --> 08:25.071
You and your guys are going
to stay away from town.

08:27.286 --> 08:28.562
Already said I would.

08:29.537 --> 08:32.140
Ask again, a guy might think
you were calling him a liar.

08:35.996 --> 08:40.143
--And that's my car.
--Well, you left it out there.
--Yeah, but it was destroyed.

08:40.147 --> 08:41.563
Lovingly restored.

08:42.227 --> 08:44.130
I told you there was a lot of good stuff
out there on the roads.

08:44.345 --> 08:46.171
This one I didn't even have to fight for.

08:46.487 --> 08:48.783
Besides, she was mine first.

08:59.556 --> 09:00.092
Emily...

09:00.096 --> 09:02.022
--Why are you talking to him?
--It's okay, all right?

09:02.027 --> 09:03.701
It didn't have anything to do with you.

09:03.935 --> 09:07.240
He's my father. It has everything to do with me.

09:08.607 --> 09:11.171
You have no idea how bad
it got after you left.

09:12.225 --> 09:13.203
He was calling.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.530
He was everywhere.

09:16.136 --> 09:17.600
He was coming by the house.

09:17.605 --> 09:18.811
He wanted to talk to me.

09:18.815 --> 09:21.112
He wanted me to forgive him
for what happened with Chris.

09:22.677 --> 09:25.393
I will never forgive him
for what happened to Chris.

09:26.177 --> 09:29.442
--And now you're back and he's back.
--Oh, he's not back.

09:30.106 --> 09:31.312
All right?

09:31.646 --> 09:33.973
After tomorrow, he's done, he's gone.

09:36.705 --> 09:39.232
--When's it supposed to happen?
--Tomorrow morning at 11:00.

09:39.815 --> 09:43.162
--So, we get the food back
and Prowse leaves us alone.
--Well, that's what he said.

09:43.167 --> 09:47.022
--Yeah, we'll see what he does.
--Either way, I think it's
important that we do this.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.990
--Okay. I'll run it by Dad.
--What's going on?

09:54.188 --> 09:55.360
Get in here.

09:57.528 --> 09:59.321
Gray Anderson's back in town.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.513
--Is he okay?
--I can't believe it.

10:06.987 --> 10:08.521
I hitched... Oh, thank you.

10:08.548 --> 10:09.900
I hitched a ride with a...

10:10.726 --> 10:12.063
with a supply truck that was running

10:12.067 --> 10:15.411
bottled water to a FEMA camp
out near Rogue River.

10:16.497 --> 10:17.433
FEMA's running.

10:17.935 --> 10:19.532
Well, that's good, at least.

10:21.718 --> 10:25.682
Well, about ten miles outside of
Topeka, we hit a roadblock.

10:25.685 --> 10:30.193
I mean, nothing official, just a couple cars rolled out
onto the highway.

10:30.198 --> 10:32.300
And as soon as we stopped, it was like...

10:33.046 --> 10:37.871
like a dozen guys just came out of nowhere
and yanked us out of the truck.

10:39.387 --> 10:44.012
I.. fought one of them
and took off on foot.
The driver...

10:46.167 --> 10:48.372
they just beat him to death right on the road.

10:50.526 --> 10:51.800
They killed him for...

10:52.316 --> 10:54.330
just a few cases of water.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.680
You guys have any electricity
yet, any lights or anything?

11:02.685 --> 11:04.901
--There was a heck of a pulse.
--No.

11:05.185 --> 11:06.701
Some simple circuits are still working

11:06.705 --> 11:08.891
like flashlights and electrical razors, but...

11:08.896 --> 11:11.123
we pretty much lost everything
with a circuit board--

11:11.437 --> 11:12.913
radio, computers,

11:13.357 --> 11:14.481
newer cars.

11:15.218 --> 11:17.901
--What's happening in Topeka?
--It's a mess.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.861
Nobody knows where the hell the governor is.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.601
And the fallout from Lawrence
hit 'em really hard.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.690
Whoa, whoa... They... They hit Lawrence?

11:26.698 --> 11:30.661
--Wh-Why would they hit Lawrence and not Topeka?
--I don't know.

11:31.138 --> 11:35.071
--What about any other major cities?
New York, DC...?
--Oh, they didn't get New York.

11:35.585 --> 11:36.973
What, New York made it?

11:37.518 --> 11:41.600
Yeah, well, after 9/11, they got pretty good
at security and apparently,

11:41.605 --> 11:45.021
NYPD caught three guys
right before they flipped the switch.

11:46.017 --> 11:47.251
They had a rented van,

11:47.485 --> 11:50.131
a 20-kiloton bomb in a steel drum.

11:51.657 --> 11:53.321
And what about DC?

11:59.475 --> 12:00.563
It's gone.

12:20.886 --> 12:21.660
Hey.

12:22.758 --> 12:24.772
--Did you hear?
--Hear what?

12:25.475 --> 12:26.331
Mr. Anderson's back.

12:26.337 --> 12:27.801
He says New York is still there.

12:29.577 --> 12:30.930
New York?

12:33.778 --> 12:36.082
--My parents?
--They might be okay.

12:37.916 --> 12:39.310
My parents.

12:51.455 --> 12:53.512
Hey. Took you long enough.

12:54.067 --> 12:56.201
Your sister went to bed a little while ago.

12:56.205 --> 12:58.273
I'm pretty sure that she still hates me.

12:58.277 --> 13:02.000
Although tonight was the first time she said
"good night" without the dirty sign mixed in.

13:02.855 --> 13:05.463
I wonder if she knows that I
know what that means.

13:08.735 --> 13:09.973
I have some bad news.

13:11.966 --> 13:12.970
Mimi...

13:16.087 --> 13:18.511
--What?
--Washington DC's gone.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.791
You know, stirring them doesn't
make them taste any better.

13:35.146 --> 13:38.250
So... Cindy Mather is dead?

13:45.616 --> 13:47.091
If she was in DC...

13:48.456 --> 13:49.690
then probably.

13:51.188 --> 13:53.560
It depends how close she was
when the bomb went off.

13:54.887 --> 13:56.050
And Joel Stafford?

14:01.926 --> 14:03.292
He's gonna ask me out.

14:04.847 --> 14:06.172
That's what Cindy said.

14:08.776 --> 14:10.842
Did they feel it wn they died?

14:11.666 --> 14:15.591
--Joel... Cindy, the Thompsons
next door...
--It, um...

14:17.467 --> 14:18.823
it would've been fast.

14:21.856 --> 14:23.950
--And Doug.
--Who's Doug?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.753
Mom's boyfriend.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.642
I thought you knew.

14:37.865 --> 14:39.031
Are you out of your mind?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.540
You made a deal with Jonah Prowse?

14:41.547 --> 14:44.893
Yeah, Mitch for the food and
Jonah stays out of Jericho. Why?

14:44.896 --> 14:49.551
--Because you can't make deals
with guys like that.
-- Wait a minute, we talked
about this. We-We agreed.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.992
Look, I know about Prowse.

14:51.577 --> 14:53.943
He hauled materials for Stevens
before I came into the mine.

14:53.945 --> 14:56.541
He was stealing five percent off
the top, intimidating suppliers.

14:56.548 --> 14:59.502
The guy did four years at Lansing for
extortion and assault.

14:59.508 --> 15:01.533
You want to negotiate with that guy?

15:02.238 --> 15:03.400
He's got a good point, Jake.

15:03.515 --> 15:07.602
--What happened to clearing this with Dad?
--Look, no disrespect to your father,
but he hasn't been out there.

15:07.915 --> 15:10.123
I've seen what happens when people
lose their hold on law and order.

15:10.127 --> 15:13.191
You start striking bargains with the
bad guys, it's the beginning of the end.

15:13.197 --> 15:14.823
Just calm down, all right?

15:15.657 --> 15:18.461
We need food more than we need to keep
Mitchell Cafferty.

15:18.928 --> 15:21.460
Now, I'm supposed to make a trade with
Jonah in an hour.

15:21.975 --> 15:25.082
--If I go out there empty-handed, I don't
know what he's gonna do.
--It doesn't matter.

15:26.308 --> 15:29.182
Because he'll know that we won't
roll over for him.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.682
Look, Jake...

15:32.465 --> 15:34.573
we either hold this territory or we don't.

15:36.597 --> 15:38.142
Eric?

15:39.687 --> 15:40.783
Gray's  right.

15:45.798 --> 15:47.781
I know this is only half the soda we swapped for

15:47.787 --> 15:51.530
--but I really need that jewelry box back.
--Oh, sorry, sweetie.

15:51.538 --> 15:52.543
We made a deal.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.033
I just found out my parents could be alive.

15:55.035 --> 15:58.501
--They might be coming home at any time.
--Oh, that's good news.

15:58.505 --> 15:59.873
I'm happy for you.

16:01.516 --> 16:03.382
That jewelry box belonged to my mother.

16:03.968 --> 16:05.980
Her grandmother gave it to her, it's...

16:06.685 --> 16:09.060
it's worth a lot more than some diet soda.

16:09.376 --> 16:12.800
I wish I could help you,
but I already traded it away.

16:13.156 --> 16:15.792
--To who?
--All trades are confidential.

16:15.796 --> 16:20.160
No  one wants to buy a jewelry box that comes
with an argument about who it belongs to.

16:21.527 --> 16:23.100
I'm sure that your parents will understand.

16:23.106 --> 16:25.322
These are hard times for all of us.

16:26.046 --> 16:27.361
Okay, fine.

16:27.988 --> 16:31.910
Dale, um, could you lock
this up in the back, please?

16:53.276 --> 16:57.092
--Looks like you forgot someone.
--The town said no to the deal with Mitch.

16:57.098 --> 16:59.070
How can I fix this?

17:50.907 --> 17:51.830
Ooh!

17:51.938 --> 17:52.960
You scared me.

17:52.965 --> 17:54.590
Hey, that's a good ghost.

17:54.617 --> 17:56.162
Oh, that's for you...

18:19.538 --> 18:21.250
No candy in here, guys.

18:49.278 --> 18:50.202
Gray!

18:50.828 --> 18:51.721
Gray!

18:53.326 --> 18:55.072
Jonah's men just took Mitchell.

18:55.287 --> 18:56.531
They're headed out the front.

19:16.757 --> 19:17.571
Hey!

19:36.396 --> 19:37.171
Hey!

19:46.657 --> 19:48.163
Gray, no!

19:54.485 --> 19:58.332
--Instead of what? Starting a
firefight on Main Street?
--I got to go out after them!

19:58.508 --> 20:01.111
--Are you out of your mind?
--This has got to be answered, Jake.

20:02.787 --> 20:04.302
What, are you gonna turn the other cheek?

20:04.657 --> 20:08.472
--How long before you think these
guys are back...?
--I can talk to Jonah.
--You can talk to Jonah... Find him!

20:08.477 --> 20:10.260
He lived up to his end of the deal.

20:11.868 --> 20:14.470
--And why the hell are you protecting this guy?
--I'm protecting this town.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.942
--He can get things we're gonna need.
--What can he get?!
--He can get food!

20:19.187 --> 20:20.280
He can get gas, he can get ammo.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.423
Could you get that stuff
if we needed it tomorrow?

20:23.406 --> 20:24.223
Could you?!

20:25.427 --> 20:26.491
Because he can!

20:29.336 --> 20:31.041
We'll do this my way now.

20:39.177 --> 20:40.701
You said you could get me a car.

20:41.528 --> 20:45.910
--Is this thing gonna die on me halfway out there?
--Charlotte? Not a chance. She's sturdy.

20:48.958 --> 20:52.571
--So, uh, be careful.
--I'm only going ten miles.

20:53.317 --> 20:54.592
I meant with him.

20:55.766 --> 20:56.891
I talked to Emily.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.351
Yeah? What'd she tell you?

21:01.197 --> 21:02.293
Enough.

21:15.516 --> 21:19.602
Hey, Darcy, Allie and Sam got a grill going outside.

21:19.607 --> 21:22.143
I think we're barbecuing Spam.

21:23.235 --> 21:24.632
They were asking for you.

21:32.186 --> 21:33.230
So, uh...

21:35.317 --> 21:36.901
I know about Doug.

21:39.867 --> 21:42.693
--What do you know?
--I know that he's probably gone.

21:43.397 --> 21:44.243
I know...

21:46.518 --> 21:49.933
--I know that he meant a lot to you.
--Robby, you don't know a damn thing.

21:54.415 --> 21:56.162
So are my kids close to him?

21:57.607 --> 22:00.643
--Why don't you ask the kids?
--I don't want to ask the kids.
I'm ask...

22:03.246 --> 22:04.450
Why did you come for me?

22:04.968 --> 22:11.303
--I told you the kids...
--No, no. In D.C., you could have
just taken the kids.

22:12.587 --> 22:14.863
We sat in traffic for two hours
that afternoon on the Beltway.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.541
--You didn't have to wait
for me. Why'd you do it?
--Why?

22:18.975 --> 22:21.952
--You hated me, Robert.
--I did not...
--You hated me.

22:23.015 --> 22:24.992
You blamed me for breaking up the marriage.

22:24.998 --> 22:28.382
And even though you left me for your work
long before I ever looked at another man.

22:32.937 --> 22:35.003
I'll tell the kids you're not feeling too well.

22:35.476 --> 22:38.070
Doug  and I had been dating for about three months.

22:39.126 --> 22:40.180
I met him at the gym.

22:42.245 --> 22:43.911
I liked the way he looked at me.

22:47.306 --> 22:51.850
And I liked the way that I felt
about myself when he looked at me.
It was nice.

22:55.138 --> 22:58.011
I was thinking about introducing him to the kids.

23:03.017 --> 23:08.262
Now I'm, I'm back in the house of secrets
with a man who looks at me like...

23:10.956 --> 23:12.122
like that.

23:15.815 --> 23:18.301
God, Robert, why on Earth did you come for me?

23:59.955 --> 24:01.431
Quite the runner, Mitch.

24:12.065 --> 24:13.432
Hey, knock it off!

24:15.595 --> 24:16.531
Let him go!

24:17.038 --> 24:18.192
Break it up. Break it up.

24:20.107 --> 24:21.111
All right, it's all right.

24:22.805 --> 24:24.242
To what do I owe

24:24.746 --> 24:27.272
A lot of people in town
who aren't going to let this stand.

24:28.057 --> 24:29.073
They're angry.

24:30.165 --> 24:33.672
They're talking about coming out here
to get him by force if necessary.

24:36.045 --> 24:40.010
Did you ever in your life think anyone
would care this much about Mitchell Cafferty?

24:40.758 --> 24:43.282
Look, you don't want it to come to that,
I don't want it to come to that.

24:43.836 --> 24:45.002
I'm here to negotiate.

24:45.127 --> 24:47.803
Last time we negotiated,
it didn't work out so good for me.

24:49.327 --> 24:52.093
Keep Mitch and keep the food.

24:52.718 --> 24:55.072
You can sell the food to the town through
Gracie Lee's market

24:55.078 --> 24:58.260
and take your cut off the top in supplies
that we have and you don't:

24:58.847 --> 25:00.482
fresh water, crops,

25:00.797 --> 25:02.110
salt from the mine.

25:02.315 --> 25:03.571
I'm listening.

25:03.576 --> 25:09.290
In exchange, you'll guarantee
that your... your business stays away from town.

25:10.037 --> 25:13.182
We'll send a trailer to pick up supplies.
You don't come to us.

25:15.486 --> 25:16.680
I'll think about it.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.912
Now let's talk about what I need.

25:25.587 --> 25:28.082
--I want to talk to Emily.
--She doesn't want to see you.

25:28.085 --> 25:30.182
She blames me for Chris's death.

25:30.398 --> 25:34.721
--Things might be different if she knew
whose faultit really was.
--I didn't sent him on that
job, all right? You did.

25:34.725 --> 25:37.292
I tried to talk him out of it.
He needed a lookout,

25:37.298 --> 25:38.552
someone to watch his back.

25:38.555 --> 25:40.423
--You left him alone!
--A lookout?

25:40.578 --> 25:41.892
He needed a father.

25:44.416 --> 25:47.333
--All right. Maybe it is time
Emily learns the truth about what you did.
--I told her.

25:47.665 --> 25:50.083
I told her, I told her everything.

25:53.428 --> 25:56.553
--Did she forgive you?
--No.

25:57.298 --> 25:58.772
Neither do I.

26:00.238 --> 26:01.200
Get her to see me,

26:01.988 --> 26:04.970
--or I'll do business wherever the hell I please.
--I can't.

26:05.415 --> 26:06.813
Then I guess we don't have a deal.

26:20.115 --> 26:21.873
Oh, hey, Eric, can I borrow you for a minute?

26:22.617 --> 26:24.013
Sure. What's up?

26:25.846 --> 26:27.391
Come on in. I, uh...

26:27.995 --> 26:31.490
I am seeing a lot of unfamiliar faces around here

26:31.497 --> 26:32.941
and I did some asking around,

26:33.765 --> 26:40.220
and apparently, there are eight new families
since I left town and 14 since the attacks.

26:42.308 --> 26:44.871
Yeah, some families had relatives come
from nearby towns.

26:44.876 --> 26:48.233
--A few more people from Colorado. Why?
--Do we know anything about them?

26:48.238 --> 26:50.220
Where they've been, what they know?

26:51.785 --> 26:53.840
I don't think I like where this
conversation's going, Gray.

26:53.848 --> 26:55.310
Well, neither do I,

26:55.317 --> 26:59.870
but I'm also sure that we can't be too careful
or too prepared.

27:06.405 --> 27:07.702
You mean Robert Hawkins?

27:07.708 --> 27:09.041
The man has two kids.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.582
He's been nothing but helpful.

27:10.586 --> 27:15.330
He shows up two days before the end
of the world with enough cash to buy
the old Thompson house.

27:15.998 --> 27:17.773
Look, I'm not suggesting anything.

27:17.778 --> 27:22.821
I'm-I'm just saying that we should know a little
more about who we're sharing our foxhole with.

27:22.827 --> 27:25.241
It costs us nothing to find out.

27:31.196 --> 27:33.680
Is there something you want to tell me?

27:35.215 --> 27:36.342
What do you mean?

27:38.065 --> 27:39.970
That jewelry box is missing.

27:41.296 --> 27:43.631
Did you steal from me, Dale?

27:45.157 --> 27:46.312
Say something.

27:47.095 --> 27:48.461
Why did you lie to her?

27:48.668 --> 27:51.632
--Why did you tell her you didn't have the box?
--We made a fair trade.

27:51.636 --> 27:55.252
I shouldn't have to explain myself
to some spoiled little girl.

27:55.818 --> 27:59.492
--You don't know her.
--Oh, I know her and everybody like her.

27:59.496 --> 28:01.952
They think the rules don't apply to them.

28:04.167 --> 28:07.050
I could understand others trying to steal from me

28:07.058 --> 28:09.621
but after everything I have done for you?

28:10.056 --> 28:13.671
--Everything you've done for me?
--I took you in.
---And what?

28:14.105 --> 28:15.383
You let me sleep here?

28:15.858 --> 28:17.912
I was the one who looked for the train.

28:18.248 --> 28:21.393
I was the one who walked five miles every day
dragging food back here.

28:21.677 --> 28:23.362
You wouldn't have a store if it wasn't for me.

28:23.367 --> 28:26.223
--Dale, honey...
--You know what?
No, I'm done.

28:26.225 --> 28:27.583
Here's your keys back.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.342
Dale, no!

28:49.856 --> 28:50.662
Hey.

28:52.886 --> 28:53.923
Where's Mary?

28:54.357 --> 28:56.453
Uh, Wednesday, night off.

28:57.548 --> 28:59.803
--What are you drinking there?
--I don't know.

29:00.398 --> 29:01.872
I think it might be kerosene.

29:02.268 --> 29:04.091
I haven't quite figured out the still yet.

29:05.107 --> 29:06.813
So how'd things go with Jonah today?

29:09.538 --> 29:12.733
I think I might have gotten us into a fight
we don't want to be a part of.

29:13.438 --> 29:14.372
Nice.

29:15.435 --> 29:17.143
How about you?
How was your day?

29:17.508 --> 29:20.311
Well, I think I'm becoming Graynderson's yes man.

29:20.975 --> 29:23.573
The worst part of it is I'm not sure if that's
a bad thing.

29:25.905 --> 29:27.193
Big day for the Green boys, huh?

29:29.597 --> 29:34.443
--Yeah. You avoiding going home telling Dad?
--Hell, yeah. You?
--Same.

29:35.688 --> 29:39.151
Yeah. You remember that timewe set the carpet
in Dad's office on fire?

29:39.546 --> 29:40.982
All you had to do was stick to the story,

29:40.987 --> 29:41.830
we would have been fine.

29:42.465 --> 29:46.281
--You wanted me to tell Dad I had a seizure
and knocked over his desk lamp.
--Yeah.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.780
Any other brilliant ideas
to get us out of this one?

29:50.467 --> 29:51.510
Not at the moment.

29:52.325 --> 29:55.943
Well, I say we finish these drinks

29:55.947 --> 30:01.390
go home and try to explain all this to Dad
in a way that won't kill him.

30:10.968 --> 30:12.723
I think you've had enough to drink.

30:13.797 --> 30:14.912
You want to come with me

30:15.825 --> 30:17.680
so we can finish our conversation?

30:18.977 --> 30:22.750
--No, I'm done talking for the day, Rob.
--I'm not kidding, Darcy.

30:22.826 --> 30:26.503
--Let's just go.
--No, all right?
--Not this time.

30:28.457 --> 30:29.860
Why don't you go home?

30:45.237 --> 30:46.123
Hey...

30:51.105 --> 30:53.861
I came back for you
because you are my wife.

31:13.597 --> 31:16.662
Hey, uh, I'm not sure how you feel about
tomato soup

31:16.666 --> 31:18.550
but I don't know.

31:18.555 --> 31:20.340
It usually makes me feel better, so...

31:23.575 --> 31:24.452
How's it coming?

31:24.456 --> 31:29.192
I've been going over all of my pending audits

31:29.195 --> 31:33.280
and I can only remember half the details
of half my cases.

31:33.918 --> 31:39.242
This one is for "almost there," and
this one is for "not even close."

31:40.886 --> 31:43.640
--You don't need to be doing all this.
--What the hell else am I going to do?

31:47.916 --> 31:48.760
Oh!

31:52.447 --> 31:53.330
Oh!

31:56.105 --> 31:57.331
Get out of my way.

31:57.495 --> 31:59.562
--I'm just trying to help you.
--Well, stop it.

31:59.727 --> 32:00.873
Look, I know what you're going through.

32:00.876 --> 32:02.931
All right? I lost my folks
when I was 18 years old,

32:02.937 --> 32:05.070
and the first few days were, were bad.

32:05.075 --> 32:10.640
Everything and everyone that I ever cared
about was incinerated four weeks ago.

32:11.327 --> 32:13.392
And you mean to tell me that you know how I feel?

32:16.117 --> 32:19.073
--I'm trying to be nice to you.
--Well, stop being nice to me!

32:25.146 --> 32:26.422
You don't owe me anything.

32:27.916 --> 32:33.363
You don't oweanyone anything anymore.

33:06.668 --> 33:08.220
Em. What are you doing here?

33:08.345 --> 33:10.330
I came here to talk to you,
but when I got here...

33:10.876 --> 33:13.042
--Hurry.
--What?
--Hurry.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.652
He went into shock or something.

33:16.997 --> 33:21.461
And one, and two, three, four. Five...

33:22.597 --> 33:27.760
1,001...1,002... 1,003...
1,004... 1,005.

33:31.816 --> 33:34.100
--He's not breathing.
--Okay, one more breath.

33:54.988 --> 33:56.700
Let's get him over on his side. Come on.

34:06.398 --> 34:08.652
I've given him three courses of antibiotics.

34:08.658 --> 34:10.592
It must have been too much for his system.

34:11.295 --> 34:12.630
He's become septic.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.431
How do we treat it?

34:18.786 --> 34:20.192
Wait a minute, April.
How do we treat it?

34:20.196 --> 34:22.449
If the Med Center were operational-- maybe.

34:22.668 --> 34:25.731
If we could MEDEVAC him into County Hospital
in Rogue River, maybe.

34:26.087 --> 34:29.350
If we had any heavy-duty meds
left in the pharmacy, maybe.

34:29.356 --> 34:30.520
Without that...

34:33.284 --> 34:34.453
12 hours.

34:34.726 --> 34:35.730
Maybe a day.

34:38.737 --> 34:39.891
I'm so sorry.

34:39.935 --> 34:40.822
What kind of meds?

34:41.926 --> 34:42.810
What?

34:43.255 --> 34:44.623
You said he needed heavy-duty meds.

34:44.627 --> 34:45.853
What, what kind would he need?

34:46.137 --> 34:49.203
Something strong enough to blow out the
infection fast.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.610
Let his body heal itself.

34:51.616 --> 34:54.360
Cipro, probably, but we ran out weeks ago.

34:55.576 --> 34:57.552
--They'd have it in Rogue River, though.
--Jake.

34:57.556 --> 34:58.883
That's 90 miles away.

34:59.326 --> 35:01.261
--I'd better get going, then.
--Wait a minute.

35:01.316 --> 35:02.412
I'm going, too.

35:02.575 --> 35:03.511
Eric. no.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.550
If Gray's right about how dangerous...

35:09.377 --> 35:10.273
Go.

35:10.688 --> 35:11.772
Go now.

35:34.135 --> 35:35.333
You wanted to talk.

35:36.455 --> 35:37.531
Let's talk.

35:48.245 --> 35:50.853
--You want to sit?
--No. I'm not here to catch up.

35:51.516 --> 35:52.952
Jake Green's dad's sick.

35:54.426 --> 35:56.393
--That so?
--Yeah.

35:57.127 --> 35:58.851
I don't care what you think of him, okay?

35:59.105 --> 36:00.721
I'm here to ask for your help.

36:02.987 --> 36:04.491
I'm not a doctor, sweetheart.

36:04.888 --> 36:06.010
No, you're not.

36:06.328 --> 36:07.331
You're a thief.

36:08.968 --> 36:12.741
--He needs meds.
He needs Cipro.
--Don't have it. Sorry.

36:16.677 --> 36:18.033
But I may be able to help.

36:29.617 --> 36:32.373
--Your mother used to make that same face.
--Stop it.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.591
You do not get to talk
about her. Or Chris. Okay?

36:41.525 --> 36:42.810
I heard you're getting married.

36:44.058 --> 36:45.180
What kind of guy is he?

36:45.386 --> 36:47.650
--How many questions do I have to answer to get your help?
--More.

36:49.026 --> 36:52.520
--What's he do? The guy.
--He's an investment banker.

36:56.106 --> 36:57.073
Emily.

36:57.987 --> 37:01.751
I've stuck by our agreement to stay away.

37:02.957 --> 37:05.683
But the past few weeks,
I've seen a lot of bad things.

37:05.685 --> 37:08.130
I just want to know
somebody's looking out for you.

37:08.887 --> 37:10.281
It's just you and me now.

37:11.335 --> 37:12.343
Your mom's gone.

37:12.835 --> 37:14.743
--Chris is gone.
--Is that what this is?

37:14.996 --> 37:16.663
--Hmm?
--What?

37:17.058 --> 37:18.643
You want us to be a family?

37:19.307 --> 37:21.441
Want somebody to invite
you for Thanksgiving dinner?

37:21.766 --> 37:26.461
If you think for one second
that I would do that again, you're crazy.

37:27.047 --> 37:29.963
I think if you want my help
saving Johnston Green's life,

37:30.597 --> 37:32.733
you got a funny way of asking, young lady.

37:36.717 --> 37:37.991
You're gonna get my help.

37:38.776 --> 37:39.822
You're my kid.

37:41.508 --> 37:44.891
But I think you and I need to
start seeing more of each other.

37:54.065 --> 37:54.873
Dale.

37:56.045 --> 37:58.491
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.591
How did you get this?

38:12.058 --> 38:13.222
Thank you.

38:15.445 --> 38:17.543
My God, this is what the fight was about.

38:18.025 --> 38:19.383
Where are you staying tonight?

38:19.676 --> 38:21.693
Ah... A friend's house.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.263
A friend's house?

38:25.826 --> 38:26.650
Come on.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.300
You can sleep on the couch at my place.

38:38.047 --> 38:40.371
--I don't think this is such a good idea.
--No choice.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.523
Well, then at least let me do
some work on the car.

38:42.525 --> 38:43.252
There's no time.

38:43.256 --> 38:45.210
--I have to go now.
--What? Wait.

38:45.215 --> 38:48.100
--You said it was sturdy.
--Well, sturdy, yeah, but what if
you need to outrun something?

38:48.107 --> 38:50.121
--Why? How fast will it go?
--I don't know.

38:50.558 --> 38:54.740
30, maybe 40 miles an hour, best
case, downhill, and not for very long.

38:54.747 --> 38:56.941
See, this is what I'm saying. Maybe
you should go on horseback.

38:56.947 --> 39:00.251
--A horse is slower than that.
--A horse is less likely to explode.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.531
I'll take my chances.

39:03.415 --> 39:05.412
Okay, well, then, at least open her up easy.

39:05.415 --> 39:08.383
Make sure you have enough car left
in case you need to ask for a lot in a hurry

39:08.386 --> 39:11.302
and remember, the gas tank on this thing]
is on the left-hand side

39:11.307 --> 39:13.521
so if somebody decides to start shooting at you

39:13.617 --> 39:14.720
make sure it's not on that side.

39:15.198 --> 39:16.202
Anything else?

39:19.476 --> 39:25.571
(And just like ships, we float
through each other's lives)

39:26.238 --> 39:31.523
(Through the waters of beauty and grace)

39:32.668 --> 39:36.082
(We will one day...)

39:35.916 --> 39:37.513
Come back in one piece.

39:38.727 --> 39:40.321
I will, I promise.

39:38.897 --> 39:45.031
(And give rest to our weary legs...)

39:45.566 --> 39:47.203
I thought you were gonna go.

39:48.676 --> 39:50.352
I'm waiting on Eric.

39:51.018 --> 39:52.300
Oh.

39:54.298 --> 39:55.350
Um...

39:56.527 --> 39:59.713
--Watch out for giant irradiated hands out there.
--Always do.

40:01.318 --> 40:02.241
Okay.

40:13.648 --> 40:14.470
You going somewhere?

40:14.676 --> 40:17.972
Yeah, my father needs
medication, stuff we don't have in town.

40:18.236 --> 40:20.171
Jake and I are going to Rogue River to find it.

40:20.648 --> 40:21.710
You sure that's a good idea?

40:24.916 --> 40:25.770
Not really.

40:26.706 --> 40:28.053
Listen, you be careful out
there, all right? You don't...

40:28.055 --> 40:30.382
you don't stop for anything,
you don't even slow down.

40:31.828 --> 40:32.683
I mean it.

40:34.778 --> 40:36.170
We'll be back before morning.

40:40.808 --> 40:42.590
Do you mind keeping an eye on things here?

40:43.988 --> 40:46.242
Of course, yeah, don't worry about it.

40:52.698 --> 40:53.780
Aw, what the hell?

40:53.928 --> 40:55.172
This is what we're driving?

40:55.636 --> 40:57.271
Yeah, I mean, it's not actually a...

40:57.906 --> 40:58.710
Yeah.

41:01.438 --> 41:02.553
What in the world?

41:03.297 --> 41:06.093
I thought the deal was we'd go get the food
and he'd stay away.

41:06.948 --> 41:07.910
It was.

41:13.706 --> 41:14.350
Em?

41:14.356 --> 41:17.562
I couldn't get you the medsyou needed, so
I got you the second-best thing.

41:17.566 --> 41:18.502
A fast car.

41:18.605 --> 41:19.771
He said it's a gift.

41:21.216 --> 41:22.812
You know there are no gifts with him.

41:26.238 --> 41:28.212
I'm really sorry you got dragged into this.

41:28.837 --> 41:29.881
Nobody dragged me.

41:30.276 --> 41:31.630
Go save your dad.

41:35.355 --> 41:37.452
Eric? Load up.

41:46.386 --> 41:49.720
(Older chests reveal themselves)

41:50.155 --> 41:51.943
(Like a crack in the wall)

41:54.357 --> 41:56.141
(Starting small)

41:58.828 --> 42:00.342
(Will grow in time)

42:03.696 --> 42:07.032
(We all seem to need the help)

42:07.505 --> 42:09.073
(Of someone else)

42:09.736 --> 42:13.420
(To mend that shelf with too many books)

42:15.336 --> 42:17.701
(Read me your favorite line)

42:21.286 --> 42:24.152
(Papa went to other lands)

42:25.078 --> 42:28.870
(And he found someone who understands)

42:29.548 --> 42:30.602
(The ticking)

42:31.467 --> 42:35.461
(The western man's need to cry)

42:38.667 --> 42:42.551
(He came back the other day, yeah, you know...)
