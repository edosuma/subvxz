AMY: Previously on "Heartland."

00:04.212 --> 00:05.505
JACK: You need to
get checked out.

00:05.630 --> 00:06.339
 I did already.

00:06.464 --> 00:07.632
Ask Verani.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.092
I'm going back to see
her this afternoon.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.802
I should be getting an MRI.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.470
 I got an update about Attila.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.514
 He's getting worse
and they want you to go?

00:14.639 --> 00:17.726
 Yeah, and they offered
to pay for you to join me.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.561
 Mongolia.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.520
Why not?

00:20.645 --> 00:23.106
 We're going to Mongolia then.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.524
 There's this girl
back in Calgary

00:24.649 --> 00:26.401
and she sort of thinks
that she's my girlfriend.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.111
 I feel totally played by you.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.446
 No, Georgie, it's
not like that, OK?

00:29.571 --> 00:30.238
Listen.
- Stop.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.698
Just go.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.866
 That kiss meant something
to me, too, you know?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.492
 My passport expired.

00:34.617 --> 00:35.744
 What?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.037
 They're getting me
an emergency renewal,

00:37.162 --> 00:38.246
but it's going to
take a few days.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.998
Attila needs you now.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.583
I'll join you, but
you need to go.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.175
[music playing]

01:07.525 --> 01:10.945
 OK, I never should have let
you convince me to do this.

01:11.071 --> 01:11.780
We have to go.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.739
 What?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.366
Why?

01:14.491 --> 01:15.992
 Because this is
private property.

01:16.117 --> 01:19.537
 I told you, I asked Paula
Westfield if we could check out

01:19.662 --> 01:22.082
her cross country course, and
she totally agreed, so it's

01:22.207 --> 01:23.708
not like we're trespassing.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.627
 OK, but--

01:25.752 --> 01:28.880
 But what?

01:29.005 --> 01:31.091
 What if I run into Dylan?

01:31.216 --> 01:34.302
 Oh, so that's
what this is about?

01:34.427 --> 01:38.139
 That party, seriously,
it was so embarrassing.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.516
Wyatt was such an idiot.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.561
 So I take it that you
and Wyatt aren't exactly

01:43.687 --> 01:45.397
on the best terms right now?

01:45.522 --> 01:46.147
 No.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.400
We're not talking.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.402
He went to Calgary with
his family for a few days,

01:50.527 --> 01:52.862
so at least I don't
have to worry about him.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.364
 Well, that's good.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.950
That'll give you a chance
to focus on training

01:57.075 --> 01:58.827
for the summer games, right?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.036
Which is why I brought you here.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.287
There's a jump I
want to show you.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.628
[music playing]

02:31.943 --> 02:33.319

looked at the latest scan

02:33.445 --> 02:35.030

02:35.155 --> 02:36.364
How are your symptoms?

02:36.489 --> 02:37.866
TIM (IN MEMORY): Same.

Occasional dizziness,
tingling in my hands,

02:40.326 --> 02:41.703
sensitivity to light.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.246
DOCTOR (IN MEMORY): OK,
we'll do another scan

02:43.371 --> 02:45.373
in a couple of weeks and
make a decision then.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.674
 It's called The Devil's Lake.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.343

jump that far.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.428
Besides, it's not
a stadium jump.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.138
It's a cross-country jump.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.932
 I know, it usually is, but
I've heard from a really good

03:03.058 --> 03:05.185
source that it's going to
be a part of the course

03:05.310 --> 03:08.188
at the summer games.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.065
 Flame's never jumped water.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.358
 It's OK.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.069
You just have to
get him used to it.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.362
 How?

03:15.487 --> 03:16.654
 That's for you

I can't return your calls.

trip to Mongolia.

How can those two make
a decision like that

without telling anyone?

04:03.284 --> 04:04.911
 Well, they told me.

 Of course they did.

 Lisa knows, too.

need to make me feel

08:07.654 --> 08:08.738

08:08.863 --> 08:10.657
 The only reason
you're feeling guilty

08:10.782 --> 08:12.409
is because you know you'd
be leaving your daughter

08:12.534 --> 08:16.204

world's oldest babysitter,

08:16.329 --> 08:17.455

 I am working, OK?

08:20.083 --> 08:22.293
Attila is sick.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.130
 Does the well-being
of a horse in Mongolia

08:25.255 --> 08:28.758
mean more to you than the
well-being of your daughter?

up my passport tomorrow.

I would really appreciate it.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.415

shouldn't have asked.

to redo my schedule.

time I talked to her

she was complaining
about her crazy workload.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.315
 She was incredible
about it, Grandpa.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.026
I think it gives her
an excuse to come home.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.320
She's been missing
Georgie and Katie,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.114
and I think that
she's looking forward

10:14.239 --> 10:16.866
to spending some quality
time with her favorite niece.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.660
So problem solved.

until you get your dad on side.

kind of hoping that maybe

10:26.960 --> 10:28.044

is so important.

11:25.101 --> 11:25.977
you know?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.065
First time I've had
a chance to think

11:30.190 --> 11:35.028
about things, about my brother.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.071
 Oh.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.329
Oh.

11:44.454 --> 11:47.165
 I don't know what
I'd do without you.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.083
I really don't.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.756
 Hey, hey.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.935
 I just don't know how
Jen made it through this.

12:11.147 --> 12:15.735
I mean, Curtis was
sick for almost a year,

12:15.860 --> 12:21.449
but the last couple of months,
they were beyond terrible.

12:28.623 --> 12:34.879
At least when Hank was
sick, it sounds horrible,

12:35.005 --> 12:36.256
but at least it was quick.

12:41.970 --> 12:42.971
 Hey, hey.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.642
 I don't know if I could ever
go through something like that

12:47.767 --> 12:48.810
again.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.985
I need a tissue.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.487
 Hey.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.406
No, no, it's not there.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.323
Here, here.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.121
There.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.080
 Thank you.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.123
 You OK?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.124
 Sorry.

13:19.758 --> 13:23.094
 Come on, let's
go have some fun.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.313
[music playing]

13:42.906 --> 13:43.948
Thanks.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.328
Altan.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.245
 Good morning.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.121
 Hi.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.539
You can call me Ty.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.749
 Good to meet you.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.376
I trust you had a good trip.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.877
 Yeah.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.630
 Oh, um, can I offer
you food, drink, rest?

13:58.755 --> 13:59.589
 I'm good.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.341
I'm good.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.053
I'd just really like to see
Attila, the stud horse that

14:05.178 --> 14:07.222
was shipped here from Calgary?

14:07.347 --> 14:12.060
 Yes, I know, the one
from Reagan Sanctuary.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.144
Hold on.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.420
[music playing]

14:44.884 --> 14:46.386
 It's a tarp.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.931
 I know it seems simple,
but this is the closest thing

14:50.056 --> 14:52.642
we have to the look of water.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.601
 OK.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.357
 There you go.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.275
 It's OK.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.568
 Yeah, he seems fine with it.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.194
That's a good sign.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.613
 Yeah, but it's different
than an actual ditch

15:05.739 --> 15:06.698
filled with water.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.575
 Georgie, just do the jump.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.534
 OK.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.119
[music playing]

15:22.380 --> 15:23.715
 I don't see how we're
going to have time

15:23.840 --> 15:25.300
to get this jump down
before you leave, let alone

15:25.425 --> 15:27.218
the actual Devil's Lake jump.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.845
I don't mean to guilt you, but--

15:28.970 --> 15:30.430
 It's OK.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.015
I promise you, I will have
you ready for this jump

15:32.140 --> 15:32.974
before I go.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.017
 OK, I'm sorry.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.602
I'm just kind of panicked.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.561
AMY: I know.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.525
 Is there a secret to this?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.401
 Yeah, I'll do it.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.235
 OK.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.445
I'll put this right here.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.404
 OK.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.947
Can you come take a look at?

15:48.073 --> 15:50.408
This these are all the
rodeos that I want to enter.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.118
So if you could go
over these and then

15:52.243 --> 15:53.286
make a training
schedule, I think

15:53.411 --> 15:55.121
that would be a great start.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.748
I think we got this.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.291
You and me, we got to go big.

15:58.416 --> 16:02.671
 Why don't you ask
Caleb to help you train,

16:02.796 --> 16:04.464
look, in case I get too busy?

16:04.589 --> 16:05.382
 No.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.549
No.

16:06.675 --> 16:07.967
Caleb is not half
the coach you are.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.344
We're supposed to be
doing this together.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.637
What are you so busy
with all of a sudden?

16:10.762 --> 16:11.971
 When am I not busy?

16:12.097 --> 16:14.974
I'm just saying.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.644
Just that's a lot of plans.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.231
 Well, you got to have plans,
otherwise it's game over.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.357
 OK.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.441
I just haven't been
able to get back

16:23.566 --> 16:26.319
down there to Dallas, Millie.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.738
It's a beautiful campus, yeah.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.323
Yup.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.952
Yeah, you got my email
about Jade Verani.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.036
Yeah.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.996
Oh, yeah, she's the real deal.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.541
She cleans up at every
rodeo she enters.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.210
Well, I'm telling you,
she's already got sponsors.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.671
She's just wasting her
time up here at University.

16:44.796 --> 16:48.008
I'd really like to see her
in your program, Billy.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.801
Well, you have better
rodeo training.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.344
You got scholarship money.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.220
I know.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.054
I know.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.556
It's cutting it close.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.475
Well, I really appreciate
you looking into it.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.768
Thank you.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.354
I just want to see her
future taken care of.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.106
Yeah.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.858
OK, yeah.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.358
No, I'm fine.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.736
Yeah, fine.
Yeah, good.

17:07.861 --> 17:08.737
OK, bye.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.744
[music playing]

17:40.185 --> 17:41.895
 Looking good.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.397
 Yeah.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.982
 What's with the tarp?

17:46.107 --> 17:49.986
 We're trying to get Flame
here used to a water jump.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.280
 It's called The
Devil's Lake, if that

17:52.405 --> 17:53.865
doesn't tell you anything.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.825
We don't even have a real
Devil's Lake to practice on.

17:55.950 --> 17:56.868
 That's not true.

17:56.993 --> 17:57.952
You can practice at Paula's.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.579
 I'm not going back there.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.956
Isn't it bad enough I already
humiliated myself in front

18:02.082 --> 18:03.583
of Dylan, not once, but twice?

18:03.708 --> 18:05.585
 Then how are you
going to practice?

18:05.710 --> 18:08.088
 I don't know.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.674
 What's this jump look like?

18:10.799 --> 18:14.302
 Well, like that.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.807
 That's not a hard build.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.725
I could take a shot
at duplicating it.

18:20.850 --> 18:21.643
 Really?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.061
 Yeah.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.980
But I don't know if you want
me ripping up this ring.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.816
 I actually have the
perfect place to build it.

18:37.325 --> 18:40.495
 Well, I guess it could
use some cleaning up.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.538
 Yeah.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.957
I'd say that's an
understatement.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.583
 It's beautiful.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.210
I can fix it up and
I'll have somewhere

18:47.335 --> 18:48.545
to practice where
no one will see me,

18:48.670 --> 18:51.798
at least while I'm
still messing up.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.049
 All right.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.342
Yeah, I'll give you a hand.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.157
 What do you think, Amy?

19:17.282 --> 19:18.700
Should we fix it up?

19:24.748 --> 19:25.999
 Amy?

19:26.124 --> 19:27.459
Amy?

19:27.584 --> 19:30.503
 What do you think,
should we fix this up?

19:30.628 --> 19:31.713
 I think that would be amazing.

19:39.804 --> 19:42.223
 He has a lot of
congestion in his lungs.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.351
We'll start him on a
course of antibiotics,

19:44.476 --> 19:46.519
but I suspect what's
going on with Attila

19:46.644 --> 19:48.980
isn't just a respiratory thing.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.732
 I agree.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.401
He was full of spirit the
first week that he was here,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.653
but then he lost himself--

19:55.779 --> 20:01.034
no interest in the other
horses and food and life.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.578
It's like he gave up

20:03.703 --> 20:05.205
 Well, I think Amy will
be able to do a lot for him

20:05.330 --> 20:06.706
when she gets here.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.083
 Your wife and Atilla,
they have a connection.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.918
 Yeah, they do.

20:10.043 --> 20:13.838
She has a gift, that's for sure.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.924
But first things first, we've
got to keep him hydrated.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.564
 Oh, yeah, I know
exactly where that is.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.066
You just take the road
north of Heartland, right?

20:33.191 --> 20:34.901
 Yeah.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.236
You just follow it to the end
and it's hidden in the trees.

20:36.361 --> 20:37.320
Ty built it for Amy
when they first met.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.238
It's super romantic.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.280
 Cool.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.407
Yeah, I'd love to see it.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.783
 You should come
watch me practice,

20:41.908 --> 20:43.785
but not while I look
like a complete loser.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.620
You should see this
ridiculous jump.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.621

20:49.165 --> 20:50.250
He's so annoying.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.209

 No, Dylan.

20:52.877 --> 20:53.545
 Dylan?

20:53.670 --> 20:54.713
Like British Dylan?

20:54.838 --> 20:56.047
Cute Dylan?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.090
What is he texting you?

20:57.215 --> 20:58.133
 No, Jade, stop.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.300
 Hey, Hey.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.222
What does he want you to
come practice at his place?

21:04.347 --> 21:05.890
 Just the jump I was
telling you about.

21:06.016 --> 21:06.933
 Yeah, that's it?

21:07.058 --> 21:08.351
 He's got one made already.

21:08.476 --> 21:09.769
He's got his own private
cross-country course.

21:09.894 --> 21:10.687
 Oh, really?

21:10.812 --> 21:12.230
How posh.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.481
I'll handle this.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.441
 OK, come on, Jade.
Give it back.

21:14.566 --> 21:15.567
I'm serious.
- OK, wait.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.027
 Come on.

21:17.152 --> 21:19.487
 Um, (BRITISH ACCENT) I
don't need your fancy course.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.490
I've got my own,
thank you very much.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.200
 (BRITISH ACCENT) Your
accent is terrible.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.370
 (BRITISH ACCENT) Well,
yours isn't very good, either.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.330
 (BRITISH ACCENT)
Bob's your uncle.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.498
 (BRITISH ACCENT)
You're so cheeky.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.791
 (BRITISH ACCENT) Cheeky chum.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.418
 [laughs] No, it's
not that great, though.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.961
[cell phone music]

21:37.297 --> 21:40.216
 Look, Daddy's calling.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.844
Hey.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.179
Ty, how are you?

21:44.304 --> 21:45.513
 I'm OK.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.723
 When did you get in?

21:46.848 --> 21:47.807
 Yesterday.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.184
Hey, Lindy.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.560
How are you, sweetheart?

21:50.685 --> 21:52.187
 She's doing really good.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.730
And guess what?

21:53.855 --> 21:56.483
Lou is coming to baby
sit, so I'm so relieved.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.693
I feel a lot better
about coming.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.652
 Good.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.364
 And found my passport.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.323
 Awesome.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.283
Awesome.

22:05.408 --> 22:08.036
 Is that Atilla?

22:08.161 --> 22:09.037
 Yeah.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.999
 He's so changed.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.250
 I know.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.710
He's doing a lot
better physically,

22:15.835 --> 22:18.630
but it's like he's depressed
or something, you know?

22:18.755 --> 22:20.715
He's not coming out of it.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.633
 Hmm.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.259
Well, I'll be there soon.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.386

22:31.101 --> 22:32.602

22:32.727 --> 22:34.479
 I think he needs you more
than medical attention.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.481
 Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

 Well, not soon enough.

your flight info, OK?

 OK, I will.

up at the airport.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.082
Say goodbye.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.667
Say bye, Daddy.

22:55.792 --> 22:56.584
 Bye.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.927
[music playing]

23:18.023 --> 23:19.941
 How's the footing?

23:20.066 --> 23:20.900
 Pretty good.

23:24.946 --> 23:29.784
 So Jack tells me Amy
is going to Mongolia.

23:29.909 --> 23:30.618
 Yeah.

23:30.744 --> 23:31.870
It's an amazing trip.

23:31.995 --> 23:32.787
 Yeah, I bet.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.543
Guess that means she won't
be at your show, though.

23:38.668 --> 23:40.837
 I'm kind of nervous about it.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.922
It'll be my first time
showing without Amy there,

23:43.048 --> 23:45.592
but Lou's coming back that
week to help with Lindy,

23:45.717 --> 23:48.928
so she'll be able to come to
the show, watch, and help out.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.473
So that'll be good.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.974
You should come, too.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.060
I mean, you're the reason
I can even compete.

23:55.185 --> 23:59.314
 Well, not if I
don't keep digging.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.231
You know what?

24:00.357 --> 24:02.442
Yeah, I'd love to.

24:02.567 --> 24:05.195
Thanks.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.488
 Can I ask you something?

24:06.613 --> 24:07.655
 Can I stop you?

24:10.950 --> 24:14.788
 I know things didn't
work out with Lou with just

24:14.913 --> 24:16.581
the distance and everything.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.166
I totally get that.

24:18.291 --> 24:24.381
But you still like
each other, right?

24:24.506 --> 24:28.885
 Georgie, it's complicated.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.179
 Sometimes you have to
break up with someone,

24:31.304 --> 24:32.347
like Wyatt, for example.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.641
What he did was unforgivable.

24:34.766 --> 24:36.476
He still had a
girlfriend in Calgary

24:36.601 --> 24:38.228
he didn't tell me
about, and then

24:38.353 --> 24:41.314
he had the nerve to accuse me of
flirting with Dylan Westfield.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.650
 Oh, I see.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.902
So there's more
than meets the eye,

24:46.027 --> 24:49.030
and why you won't train
at the Westfield course

24:49.155 --> 24:53.201
and why I'm up to
my knees in dirt.

24:53.326 --> 24:56.162
Is that young love that
I smell in the air?

24:56.287 --> 24:58.623
 No, that's horse crap.

24:58.748 --> 24:59.791
Keep digging.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.056
[ringing]

25:21.521 --> 25:23.356
 Hey, stranger.

25:23.481 --> 25:24.399
 Hey.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.317
 How's it going?

25:26.443 --> 25:27.652
 Good.

25:27.777 --> 25:28.903
 You know I still
have an empty house.

25:29.029 --> 25:29.904
I don't know why
you're not coming over

25:30.030 --> 25:32.824
and taking advantage of that.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.034
You OK?

25:34.159 --> 25:35.493
 Yeah, I'm good.

25:35.618 --> 25:36.870
I'm fine.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.788
 Well, maybe you can
buy a lady a coffee.

25:38.913 --> 25:40.081
 Well, they're
already on the house,

25:40.206 --> 25:41.750
so sure.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.710
 Oh, great, you're here.

25:43.835 --> 25:45.420
Tim, can you check
over these forms, make

25:45.545 --> 25:46.421
sure I filled them out right?

25:46.546 --> 25:47.464
Coffee?

25:47.589 --> 25:48.340
 Yeah, I'd love one.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.550
Thanks.

25:50.675 --> 25:54.512
 Yeah, Jade, isn't it a little
early to be booking these fall

25:54.637 --> 25:55.972
events?

25:56.097 --> 25:57.515
 Well, there are deadlines.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.309
 You don't know what you'll
be doing that far ahead.

25:59.434 --> 26:01.436
Anything can happen.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.146
 Well, yes, I do know.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.231
During the week I'll be
sitting in my boring classroom

26:05.357 --> 26:07.734
and on the weekend I'll be
on the circuit with you.

26:07.859 --> 26:10.320
 I'm just saying,
Jade, you want to keep

26:10.445 --> 26:11.905
an open mind for the future.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.323
 You know, actually
you're right.

26:13.448 --> 26:17.327
You're absolutely right,
and I've been thinking.

26:17.452 --> 26:21.289
I figure if I win at least
half of these rodeos,

26:21.414 --> 26:23.750
I can probably just drop
out of school altogether

26:23.875 --> 26:26.002
and do the pro
circuit full-time,

26:26.127 --> 26:27.587
you know, all over
North America.

26:27.712 --> 26:30.590
 Or you might
consider enrolling

26:30.715 --> 26:32.550
in an American college
that specializes

26:32.676 --> 26:34.302
in nurturing rodeo stars.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.720
How about that?

26:35.845 --> 26:37.222
 Yes, if I could afford that.

26:37.347 --> 26:38.098
[clanging]

26:38.223 --> 26:40.100
 Oh.

26:40.225 --> 26:40.934
Sorry.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.435
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.520
 Are you OK?

26:43.645 --> 26:44.979
 It just slipped
out of my hand.

26:51.194 --> 26:52.987
 Good boy.

26:53.113 --> 26:55.615
Your lungs look much
clearer, Atilla.

26:55.740 --> 26:58.326
You're on the mend.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.577
Amy's coming, all right?

26:59.703 --> 27:01.579
She'll be here soon.

27:01.705 --> 27:04.165
 Hey, Ty.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.959
 Hey.

27:06.084 --> 27:08.670
He's doing a lot better.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.423
 But the spirit's still lost.

27:11.548 --> 27:13.216
 That's my wife's department.

27:13.341 --> 27:14.801
She'll be here in
a couple of days

27:14.926 --> 27:18.096
and I'm sure we'll see
some real improvement.

27:18.221 --> 27:20.473
 I come to tell you,
there have been some calls.

27:20.598 --> 27:21.516
Someone's trying to reach you.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.392
I have the number.

27:22.517 --> 27:25.353
Follow me.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.355
[music playing]

27:32.902 --> 27:34.529
 Hey, Bata, what's going on?

27:34.654 --> 27:36.322
 You have to come to the camp.

27:36.448 --> 27:37.240
We are under attack.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.367
We need your help.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.785
 What?

27:40.910 --> 27:41.619
Where's Gavin?

27:41.745 --> 27:42.620
 He left.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.706
[coughing]

27:44.831 --> 27:45.957
He's a coward.

27:46.082 --> 27:46.666
[gunshots]

27:46.791 --> 27:48.460
He ran away.

27:48.585 --> 27:49.502
 What do you mean he ran away?
What are you talking about?

27:49.627 --> 27:50.462
What's the problem?

27:50.587 --> 27:51.755
 Can you come?

27:51.880 --> 27:54.174
It's really important
that you come.

27:54.299 --> 27:55.633
 Bata?
BATA (ON PHONE): [inaudible]

27:55.759 --> 27:56.718
 Bata, are you there?

28:01.514 --> 28:03.016
[blending]

28:03.850 --> 28:05.352
[ringing]

28:09.272 --> 28:10.482
 Hey, Amy.

28:10.607 --> 28:11.858
 Hey, how are you?

28:11.983 --> 28:13.401
How's Atilla?

28:13.526 --> 28:16.738
 Oh, still pretty lethargic,
but he's getting there.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.740
He could use some of your magic.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.325
 I'll see what I can do.

28:20.450 --> 28:24.454
 Listen, Amy, [buzzing]
disturbing [buzzing] Bata.

28:24.579 --> 28:26.164
 That's the guy that
you met last year.

28:26.289 --> 28:27.791
 Yeah.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.501
There's something going on in
[buzzing] Without Borders Camp,

28:29.626 --> 28:30.960
and I'm heading there now.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.587
The bad news is I'm not
going to be able to pick

28:32.712 --> 28:33.588
you up at the airport.

28:33.713 --> 28:34.589
 What?

28:34.714 --> 28:35.840
Are you serious?

28:35.965 --> 28:37.550
 Listen, I'm really sorry, Amy.

28:37.676 --> 28:39.469
But I'll be at the breeder's
center before you even arrive,

28:39.594 --> 28:40.595
OK?

28:40.720 --> 28:41.930
Altan, he's the manager here.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.098
He'll pick you up at
the airport and take you

28:43.223 --> 28:45.183
right back to the center, OK?

28:45.308 --> 28:46.434
 OK, Altan.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.519
Got it.

28:47.644 --> 28:48.353
 Trust me, he's a good guy.

28:48.478 --> 28:51.606
It'll all work out.

28:51.731 --> 28:52.691
Amy-- [buzzing]

28:52.816 --> 28:54.401
 Ty, yeah, I'm right here.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.069
 Amy, he's [buzzing] Alden--

29:02.909 --> 29:05.036
[music playing]

29:26.057 --> 29:29.019
 If Ty isn't picking
you up at the airport,

29:29.144 --> 29:30.228
I don't think you should go.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.688
 I have to agree.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.274
 The manager of the center
himself is picking me up.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.443
He's totally trustworthy, so
there's no reason to worry.

29:36.568 --> 29:37.527
 A guy we don't know.

29:37.652 --> 29:38.903
 His name is Altan.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.780
 Yeah, OK, a stranger
is picking you up.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.532
 No, that is not happening.

29:42.657 --> 29:44.951
 I traveled all around
Europe by myself.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.871
 Traveling through Europe
with an equestrian team

29:47.996 --> 29:51.499
is a lot different than
driving around Mongolia

29:51.624 --> 29:53.001
with a stranger.

29:53.126 --> 29:55.879
 OK, maybe it is, but
Atilla needs my help.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.464
Ty needs my help.

29:57.589 --> 30:00.300
And I have been hired to
do a job, so I'm not going.

30:00.425 --> 30:01.968
 No, well, you're
not going alone.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.595
 I don't understand
what the big deal is.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.597
I think I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

30:05.722 --> 30:07.015
I'm going.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.558
 Fine.

30:08.683 --> 30:12.437
If you're that determined
to go, I'm coming with you.

30:12.562 --> 30:14.939
 [laughs] No.

30:15.065 --> 30:17.317
You'll last a day.

30:17.442 --> 30:18.526
I'll go.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.029
 Dad, I can do this on my own.

30:21.154 --> 30:24.449
You don't need to come with me.

30:24.574 --> 30:26.368
Hey, Lou.

30:26.493 --> 30:27.994
What?

30:28.119 --> 30:29.454
No.

30:29.579 --> 30:30.789
OK, but you're
still coming, right?

30:30.914 --> 30:32.665
You're just-- OK.

30:32.791 --> 30:36.378
No, I'll-- I'm going to
be gone by then, Lou, I--

30:36.503 --> 30:39.172
 It's like three
inches from Afghanistan.

30:39.297 --> 30:40.131
 OK.

30:40.256 --> 30:40.799
OK.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.217
OK, fine.

30:42.342 --> 30:45.637
OK, bye.

30:45.762 --> 30:48.264
Lou can't come until I've
already left, but that's OK.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.350
She's going to be here
the day after I leave

30:50.475 --> 30:52.060
and I'm going to go.

30:52.185 --> 30:53.311
Everything's going to be fine.

31:00.777 --> 31:02.654
 Hey.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.739
This looks incredible.

31:04.864 --> 31:08.034
It's so different than before.

31:08.159 --> 31:09.619
 I thought you were packing.

31:09.744 --> 31:13.331
 I was, but my dad and
Grandpa are driving me crazy.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.250
Oh, your mom doesn't
get in till the day

31:15.375 --> 31:17.335
after tomorrow now,
which means she's not

31:17.460 --> 31:19.337
going to be here when I leave.

31:19.462 --> 31:20.505
I'm a little worried about it.

31:20.630 --> 31:21.715
 It's OK.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.717
We'll look after
Lindy, won't we?

31:23.842 --> 31:25.176
 I know you guys will.

31:25.301 --> 31:25.969
Good work.

31:26.094 --> 31:27.846
 Oh, thanks.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.222
 All right, you just wait.

31:29.347 --> 31:32.267
 All right, here,
I'll give you a leg up.

31:32.392 --> 31:35.061
 1, 2, 3.

31:35.186 --> 31:36.896
[music playing]

31:47.323 --> 31:47.907
AMY: Wow.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.117
MITCH: Yay.

31:51.578 --> 31:52.412
 Whoo.

31:52.537 --> 31:53.246
MITCH: Wow.

31:53.371 --> 31:54.122
 How was that, coach?

31:54.247 --> 31:57.208
 That was incredible.

31:57.334 --> 31:59.836
 You know, why don't
you give it a try?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.880
I've heard through the
grapevine you're pretty good.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.631
 No, Mitch, I can't.

32:03.757 --> 32:04.466
MITCH: Come on.

32:04.591 --> 32:05.467
 Come on, Amy.

32:05.592 --> 32:09.054
 Here, I'll take Lindy.

32:09.179 --> 32:11.473
 I'll do it, but I'm
not going over that jump.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.475
[music continuing]

32:39.751 --> 32:40.627
 Bata.

32:46.049 --> 32:46.883
[coughing]

32:47.008 --> 32:48.468
Hey, you all right?

32:51.096 --> 32:53.056
What happened here?

32:53.181 --> 32:55.642
 Poachers.

32:55.767 --> 32:59.145
They've gone from village to
village, burning them down.

33:01.773 --> 33:03.316
 Why?

33:03.441 --> 33:09.280
 It's payback for reporting
them to authorities.

33:09.406 --> 33:14.869
My friend, you have to
stay, just for a few days.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.162
I need your help.

33:16.287 --> 33:17.539
 I don't know.

33:17.664 --> 33:19.457
My wife is on her way
over here right now.

33:19.582 --> 33:20.542
 She shouldn't.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.002
The danger is spreading.

33:24.629 --> 33:26.131
[non-english speech]

34:05.420 --> 34:07.380
 So we're not going to
talk Amy out of this.

34:07.505 --> 34:09.507
 No.
