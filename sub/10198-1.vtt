02:30.680 --> 02:33.592
I used to think a wedding
was a simple affair.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.712
Boy and girl meet.
They fall in love. He buys a ring.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.308
She buys a dress.
They say, "l do."

02:41.800 --> 02:44.997
I was wrong.
That's getting married.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.079
A wedding is an entirely
different proposition.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.237
I know.
I've just been through one.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.669
Not my own,
my daughter's--

02:54.800 --> 02:57.951
Annie Banks-MacKenzie.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.231
That's her married name--
MacKenzie.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.628
I'll be honest with you.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.639
When I bought this house 17 years ago,
it cost less than this blessed event...

03:09.760 --> 03:13.275
in which Annie Banks
became Annie Banks-MacKenzie.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.789
I'm told that one day
I'll look back on all this...

03:15.920 --> 03:19.356
with great affection
and nostalgia.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.517
I hope so.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.835
You fathers will understand.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.793
You have a little girl...

03:27.920 --> 03:30.639
an adorable little girl
who looks up to you...

03:30.760 --> 03:34.355
and adores you in a way
you could never have imagined.

03:34.480 --> 03:39.600
I remember how her little hand
used to fit inside mine...

03:39.720 --> 03:43.235
how she used to lover to sit on my lap
and lean her head against my chest.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.238
She said I was her hero.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.271
Then the day comes when she wants
to get her ears pierced...

03:48.400 --> 03:51.437
and wants you to drop her off a block
before the movie theatre.

03:51.560 --> 03:54.597
Next thing you know, she's
wearing eye shadow and high heels.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.156
From that moment on
you're in a constant state of panic.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.874
You worry about her going out
with the wrong kind of guys...

04:01.000 --> 04:03.560
the kind of guys
who only want one thing.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.557
And you know exactly
what that one thing is...

04:05.680 --> 04:07.910
because it's the same thing you wanted
when you were their age.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.517
Then she gets a little older...

04:11.640 --> 04:14.473
and you quit worrying about her
meeting the wrong guy...

04:14.600 --> 04:17.319
and you worry about her
meeting the right guy.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.194
And that's the biggest fear
of all because...

04:22.440 --> 04:25.079
then you lose her.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.510
And before you know it, you're sitting
all alone in a big, empty house...

04:28.640 --> 04:33.475
wearing rice on your tux,
wondering what happened to your life.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.115
It was just six months ago
that it happened here.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.199
Just six months ago
that the storm broke.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.637
Annie had been studying
for her masters in architecture...

04:45.760 --> 04:47.671
for the past semester in Rome.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.155
I remember I was at work,
walking through the factory.

04:50.280 --> 04:54.068
I own a company called Sidekicks.
We manufacture athletic shoes.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.873
Anyway, I remember
how preoccupied I was that day.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.355
- I'm sorry, Mr Banks.
- My fault, Grace.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.758
Annie had never been that far away from
home, and she was due back any minute.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.314
I couldn't wait
to see the kid.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.191
George, she landed.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.788
My daughter has been studying abroad,
been flying for 11 hours.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.434
I'm not wild about her being
in the air. You have kids, Juan.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.199
You understand. It's-lt's better
when they're on the ground.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.190
I've always been
a concerned parent.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.517
I'm big on car seats,
seat belts, bedtimes, curfews...

05:29.640 --> 05:32.552
calling when you get somewhere,
never running with a sharp object.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.796
- Hi, George.
- What can I say? I'm a father.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.037
- Worrying comes with the territory.
- Is Nina picking her up at the airport?

05:38.160 --> 05:39.229
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna meet them?

05:39.360 --> 05:40.952
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm going home right now.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.911
I, uh-- My keys are--

05:43.040 --> 05:44.029
- Here.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.037
- And sign this.
- Okay.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.590
- Hat.
- Okay, thanks. Now-- Oh!

05:54.240 --> 05:55.514
- Okay. Bye.
- Bring her by.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.276
I left work early because I had
a little something to pick up
for Annie's homecoming.

06:02.800 --> 06:07.157
We live in a small town in
Southern California called San Marino.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.555
I love this town, and not
just because it's the kind of place...

06:09.680 --> 06:11.671
where people still
smile at each other...

06:11.800 --> 06:15.156
- Bye.
- but because it hasn't changed much
in the past 25 years.

06:15.280 --> 06:19.159
And since I'm not a guy who's big on
change, this town fits me like a glove.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.029
I got Annie's ten-speed
all cleaned up and polished.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.072
New seats, new tyres.
I couldn't wait to show it to her.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.554
This is our house.
24 Maple Drive.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.069
Annie was just in grammar school
when we bought it.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.954
A few years later, we got
a surprise package-- our son Matt.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.674
I love this house.
I love that I taught my kids...

06:44.800 --> 06:46.677
to ride their bikes
in the driveway.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.394
I love that I slept with them
in tents in the backyard.

06:49.520 --> 06:53.035
I love that we carved our initials
in the tree out front.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.276
This house is warm in the winter,
cool in the summer...

06:55.400 --> 06:57.675
and looks spectacular
with Christmas lights.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.429
It's a great house,
and I never want to move.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.596
But the think I think
I like best about this house...

07:03.720 --> 07:06.280
are the voices I hear
when I walk through the door.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.675
- Hey. Hi. You got out early.
- Hi.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.995
- Where is she?
- Oh, she's, uh, unpacking.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.671
She looks-- She looks so fabulous,
just fabulous. Different.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.473
- Anyway, she can't wait to see you.
- Different.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.795
- Ciao, Papa.
- Hey.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.831
Annie brought me this candy bar
all the way from Rome.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.996
Let's not get it
on our American furniture.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.588
Matty. The high tops.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.159
- Hey, grazie.
- Hey, you're welcome.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.273
- What do you mean, different?
- Oh.

07:43.320 --> 07:46.630
- Annie.
- Hi, Dad.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.431
Hey, hey, hey!

07:50.560 --> 07:53.996
- God, I missed you.
- You look all lit up inside.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.918
Oh, I feel
all lit up inside.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.713
- Maybe we should go to Rome
for a few months, honey.
- Oh, you two would love it.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.434
It's the most romantic place
on Earth.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.916
- You smell pretty good too.
- Oh, you like it? It was a present.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.838
Doesn't she look incredible?
I almost didn't recognize her.

08:08.960 --> 08:12.839
Come on. Dinner's on the stove.
Honey, you wanna come?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.918
Oh, Mom, I had this pasta in Florence.
I forget what it's called.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.792
All right. Now that
we're all back under one roof...

08:22.920 --> 08:25.434
we have some very important items
to discuss.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.791
First on the list: Who wants to go
to the Laker game on Thursday?

08:28.920 --> 08:31.480
- Oh.
- Me. Definitely yes.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.919
Okay, and with
your busy schedule too.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.076
Honey, I can't. I have
inventory to do that night.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.351
- Aw.
- Uh, Thursday, sure. Absolutely.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.597
- Okay.
- Matty, could you use your fork?

08:41.720 --> 08:44.792
Number two: Paul Simon
is coming to the Forum...

08:44.920 --> 08:46.751
and I think I can
get us great seats.

08:46.880 --> 08:52.000
- Um, yeah, sure.
- All right. Paul Simon's
an "um, yeah, sure..."

08:52.120 --> 08:54.350
which I believe
translates to a yes?

08:54.480 --> 08:56.948
- All right. I'll call that guy.
- Um, honey?

08:57.080 --> 08:58.991
Could you please get that
bottle of wine in the fridge for me?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.112
- Sure.
- Dad, wait. Um, I don't know.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.915
- You don't want to see Paul Simon?
- No, l-l do. It's just, um--

09:06.040 --> 09:07.234
- Well, what is it?
- Well--

09:07.360 --> 09:09.590
- Honey, is something going on?
- Yes.

09:09.720 --> 09:13.838
Yeah, it is, Mom. Uh-- God, this is
a hard thing to tell parents.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.872
Especially when they're
my parents. Oh, God.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.672
Honey, just say it.
What's the big deal?

09:18.800 --> 09:21.075
- Yeah.
- Okay.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.873
I met somebody in Rome.
Um, he's an American.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.993
Uh, he's from L.A., actually,
and, um, his name's Bryan MacKenzie.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.954
And he's this
completely wonderful...

09:36.080 --> 09:39.755
wonderful, amazing man, and--

09:39.880 --> 09:42.553
Well, we, we started
seeing each other...

09:42.680 --> 09:45.797
a lot, and, um...

09:45.920 --> 09:47.797
we fell in love.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.639
It actually happened.
And, uh...

09:50.760 --> 09:55.959
we've decided to get married
which means that I'm engaged!

09:56.080 --> 09:58.958
I'm engaged!
I'm getting married!

10:01.040 --> 10:04.715
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.910
Well, my, my.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.828
Oh, so-- Oh, my. And that's
your engagement ring, huh?

10:10.960 --> 10:14.396
Yes, yes! We got it
at a flea market outside of Rome.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.479
The guy we bought it from said
it was at least 100 years old.

10:18.600 --> 10:22.673
- Wow.
- So, Dad. Stop it. Say something.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.793
I-l'm sorry.
What did you say?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.718
Dad, I met a man in Rome,
and he's wonderful...

10:29.840 --> 10:33.037
and brilliant,
and we're getting married.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.554
- Mom, what's he doing?
- George.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.995
George, what is it?

10:43.360 --> 10:46.875
Well. This is-- This--

10:47.000 --> 10:49.195
This is ridiculous.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.834
- What?
- You're-- You're-- You're
too young to get married.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.952
Too young? Dad, I'm 22.
If I'm not mistaken...

10:55.080 --> 10:57.640
that's, that's a year older
than Mom was when you guys got married.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.877
- That is absolutely not true.
- Oh, no, you-- Ha!

11:01.000 --> 11:02.752
You're absolutely wrong.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.553
- You were this age when I married you?
- No! I was younger.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.911
I was this age
when she was born.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.315
That-- That-- That doesn't matter.
Times have changed.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.956
You mother was mature, and, uh,
22 isn't what it used to--

11:16.080 --> 11:19.675
Matty, would you turn on
the air conditioner? It's hot in here.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.870
I thought-- I thought you didn't
believe in marriage.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.468
I thought that it meant
that a woman lost her identity.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.989
I-l thought you wanted to get a job
before you settled down...

11:27.120 --> 11:29.236
so you could earn money
and be your own person.

11:29.360 --> 11:30.952
All right. Hold on.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.356
I didn't think I believed
in marriage until I met Bryan.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.436
And Bryan's not like any other guy
I've ever known.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.391
I want to be married to him.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.080
And I'm not gonna lose
my identity with him...

11:41.200 --> 11:44.636
because he's not
some overpowering, macho guy.

11:44.760 --> 11:48.719
I mean, he's like you, Dad,
except he's brilliant.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.037
He happens to love the fact
that I want to be an architect.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.197
He wants me to design
a house for us to live in.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.153
He said he'd move
anywhere I got a job.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.157
Give me a little credit, George.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.078
I'm not gonna marry some ape
who wants me to wear...

12:03.200 --> 12:05.350
go-go boots and an apron.

12:05.480 --> 12:09.075
I'm telling you you'll love him.
He's a genius.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.077
And sweet.

12:11.200 --> 12:16.035
And l-- I love him more
than anything in the world.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.754
- What does Bryan do?
- Who's Bryan?

12:21.400 --> 12:26.474
- I forgot his name!
- He's an independent
communications consultant.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.795
- Independent?
- Yes.

12:28.920 --> 12:33.311
Yeah. That's code for "unemployed." This
is perfect. You meet an unemployed...

12:33.440 --> 12:36.716
amazingly brilliant non-ape
that I'm going to have to support.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.434
I suppose I'm going to have to hire him
and fire some hard-working guy...

12:39.560 --> 12:41.915
with three kids
because my son-in-law--

12:42.040 --> 12:45.430
the, the independent
communications consultant--

12:45.560 --> 12:47.516
can't get a job anywhere else.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.030
No wonder he'll move
anywhere you get a job.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.958
You're not getting married,
and that's it, and that's final.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.436
And I don't like you calling me George.
I mean, when did this start?

12:57.560 --> 12:59.551
Daddy, what is wrong with you?

13:06.240 --> 13:08.276
What? You're telling me
you're happy about this ?

13:08.400 --> 13:10.356
George, please, will you stop
acting like a lunatic father...

13:10.480 --> 13:12.869
and go out and talk to her
before she runs out that door...

13:13.000 --> 13:15.070
marries this kid
and we never see her again?

13:19.040 --> 13:20.917
All right.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.471
"Kid." How do you know he's a kid?
He could be 45 years old.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.597
An independent
communications consultant...

13:43.720 --> 13:47.633
does not mean
he's an unemployable non-ape.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.150
Bryan happens to be
a computer genius.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.113
Companies send him all over the world
hooking up these complex systems.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.118
Major banks and corporations
send him to, to Tokyo...

13:57.240 --> 13:58.798
and Brazil and Geneva.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.558
I mean, he's--
He's a genius.

14:00.680 --> 14:04.593
You mentioned that.
How old is this genius?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.917
Twenty-six, not forty-five.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.873
You guys still think I can't hear you
when you're one room away.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.519
If you love him so much,
I know I'll love him too.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.238
- Bryan?
- Mackenzie.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.635
Bryan MacKenzie.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.876
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to meet him.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.072
Good, 'cause he'll be here
in an hour to meet you.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.514
I suppose you're not in the mood
for a little one-on-one?

14:38.640 --> 14:42.030
- Daddy, I'm wearing heels.
- Come to the right place.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.953
I've got sunshine

14:52.080 --> 14:54.196
On a cloudy day

14:57.200 --> 15:00.988
When it's cold outside

15:01.120 --> 15:03.588
I've got the month of May

15:05.520 --> 15:08.353
-He's got it behind the back. The crowd
is going wild. The crowd is going wild.
-I guess

15:08.480 --> 15:10.710
- It's-- It's--
- You say

15:10.840 --> 15:15.072
What can make me feel this way

15:15.200 --> 15:18.317
My girl, my girl
my girl

15:18.440 --> 15:21.591
- Talkin' 'bout my girl
- Hey!

15:21.720 --> 15:27.352
My girl, ooh-ooh

15:36.160 --> 15:38.435
Hey, hey, hey

15:40.640 --> 15:42.949
- Hey, hey, hey
- Yes.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.874
- Dad!
- Yes!

15:47.000 --> 15:49.594
Oh, travelling!

15:49.720 --> 15:53.508
I don't need no money

15:53.640 --> 15:56.950
Fortune or fame

15:58.440 --> 16:02.718
I got all the riches, baby

16:02.840 --> 16:05.274
- This is it. Eight up.
- One man can claim.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.594
- Go.
- Ready?

16:07.640 --> 16:10.200
Well, I guess

16:10.320 --> 16:12.436
- You'll say
- Hold on.
- No!

16:12.560 --> 16:16.997
- What can make me feel this way
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
No, no, no, no. No!

16:17.120 --> 16:20.351
My girl, my girl
my girl

16:20.480 --> 16:23.119
- Talkin' 'bout my girl
- Yes!

16:23.240 --> 16:26.437
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

16:26.560 --> 16:29.233
- I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
- All right.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.954
With my girl

16:32.080 --> 16:33.718
I've even got the month of May

16:33.840 --> 16:35.273
You're not really getting married,
are you?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.675
Dad, stop!

16:48.960 --> 16:51.679
- So can you see him?
What does he look like?
- He just drove up.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.473
And?

16:55.600 --> 16:58.114
He drove too fast.

17:09.880 --> 17:14.112
Well, wait. So, George,
you want to meet him?

17:14.240 --> 17:16.913
Do I want to meet him?

17:23.760 --> 17:27.195
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Hello, I'm Brian MacKenzie.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.709
Good. I'm Nina Banks.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.910
Yes. Yes, I recognize you
from your picture.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.871
- Yes, come in, please.
- The one Annie had with her in Rome.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.835
- Yes. Oh, good. Come in.
- Okay. Hello, Mr Banks.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.952
It was the first time I ever
hated the sound of my own name.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.992
- Hi.
- I've heard so much about you.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.190
It's great
to finally meet you, sir.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.756
"Sir." Two words
now crossed my mind:

17:50.880 --> 17:52.677
"brown" and "nose."

17:52.800 --> 17:56.429
Annie talks about you so much,
I feel like I already know you.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.358
- Bryan.
- Oh, Annie.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.678
- So this is him.
- Oh, he's just-- Uh, just.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.837
A little nervous. Just like one
of those situations you read about...

18:14.960 --> 18:17.679
you know,
meeting the in-laws.

18:17.800 --> 18:21.395
But you two seem great. I'm sure
I have nothing to be nervous about.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.750
But, uh, still, l--

18:23.880 --> 18:26.155
Let's, let's, uh, uh,
go into the, uh, uh, the, uh--

18:26.280 --> 18:28.475
The-- uh-- Great.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.750
- I think he's adorable.
- I don't like him.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.190
- Oh, George, for God--
- He's wearing Nikes.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.874
- Mom, where's Matty?
- Oh, he fell asleep watching TV.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.470
- Oh, well, you'll meet him tomorrow.
- Okay.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.477
- Sit down.
- So.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.751
Um, how did you two, uh, meet?

18:48.880 --> 18:53.317
Oh. We were the only two people
at this revival house in Rome...

18:53.440 --> 18:56.273
for a midnight showing
of Bringing Up Baby.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.914
- We kept hearing each other laugh.
- And at all the same places.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.508
Yeah. When it was over,
I picked him up.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.437
Oh, no, no, no. I went over
to you to ask directions...

19:03.560 --> 19:06.757
and then one thing
led to another and--

19:06.880 --> 19:08.916
And that was it.
For the next three months...

19:09.040 --> 19:10.951
we never left
each other's sight.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.868
We went to all these museums,
all these great concerts, the opera.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.310
We travelled to the country. Remember
that place we stayed in Tuscany?

19:18.440 --> 19:21.113
Oh, with the, uh--

19:21.240 --> 19:24.038
- Uh, suffice it to say,
it was not a four-star hotel.
- No.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.071
You have a very brave daughter.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.073
Bryan, um, what is it exactly
that you do?

19:31.200 --> 19:33.714
Annie was saying
something about computers.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.957
Uh, yes, uh, I'm an independent
communications consultant.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.798
Yeah, yeah,
that part I heard.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.150
Sounds fake, right?
Like it's not a real job?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.555
- No, we wouldn't say that. No.
- That's what my dad said...

19:43.680 --> 19:45.272
when he first heard
what I was doing.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.517
But, um, what it is,
uh, in this case:

19:48.640 --> 19:50.437
Uh, Pacific lnternational Bank
sent me to Rome to hook up...

19:50.560 --> 19:52.869
the X-Dot connection
to their European subsidiary.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.630
Um-- Uh, all European computers, uh,
communicate on the Dot 25 network.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.910
And, uh, since Pacific lnternational
is an L.A.-based firm...

20:00.040 --> 20:04.113
they wanted to interface with standard
European protocol, so I set 'em up.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.073
And, uh, why are you, uh, independent?
What was that?

20:10.200 --> 20:13.237
Because no one can afford
to keep him on staff.

20:13.360 --> 20:17.319
Well, I guess that's true,
basically, but, uh--

20:17.440 --> 20:21.513
You know, driving down here,
I tried to put myself in your place.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.790
Your daughter comes home
after spending four months in Rome...

20:23.920 --> 20:26.275
a-and I'm sure you couldn't wait
to see her, and she shocks you...

20:26.400 --> 20:28.675
with the news
that she's getting married.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.756
And to somebody
you've never met before.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.269
I'm sure that
must've been pretty...

20:33.400 --> 20:36.358
um, heavy...

20:36.480 --> 20:39.392
to use a word
from your generation.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.193
I just wanna say
that I'm an upstanding citizen.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.197
I've-l've never been
engaged before.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.915
I've, uh, never really
been in love before.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.272
And, uh, I think Annie's
the greatest person I've ever met.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.834
And I can't wait
to marry her and...

20:54.960 --> 20:58.316
one day have children
and grandchildren.

21:01.120 --> 21:05.238
And I'm gonna do my best
to be supportive of her dreams.
And she's a very gifted architect.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.432
Um-- I'm just thrilled
that I met her.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.597
I love your daughter.

21:13.720 --> 21:18.430
And the feelings that I have for her
are never gonna change.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.711
And I'm here to stay.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.274
- Oh, honey.
- Mom.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.157
I'm so happy for you.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.316
That's okay, Mr Banks,
We don't have to hug.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.749
- Well, uh, maybe later.
- I know.

21:34.880 --> 21:39.158
Well, that was just, um--
That was just the best thing
I've ever heard anybody say.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.995
- Oh. Good.
- Well, I meant it.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.395
Listen, I want to take Bryan out
for a drive, show him around San Marino.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.795
- Okay, honey. Good.
- Annie, it's a little nippy out.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.115
- You might want to put on a sweater.
- Oh, Dad, it's okay. I'm kinda warm.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.753
Still, there's a chill in the air,
and you've been on a plane.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.075
- Dad, I'm fine.
- Annie, it is kinda cold out.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.155
- It is?
- Yeah.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.750
- All right, thanks. I'll get my jacket.
- All right.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.759
Right then, I realized
my day had passed.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.156
She'll always love me, of course,
but not in the same way.

22:06.280 --> 22:09.192
I was no longer the man
in my little girl's life.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.754
I was like an old shoe,
the kind we manufacture...

22:11.880 --> 22:15.873
and get all excited about and then
after a few years discontinue.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.152
That was me now:
Mr Discontinued.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.919
Mom? Don't wait up, okay?
We might stop for a cappuccino.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.235
Oh, okay, fine.
Well, good night, Bryan.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.476
Good night.
Um, good night, Mr Banks.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.750
Oh, you can call him George,
or Dad.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.394
- George will be fine.
- Okay. Uh--

22:32.520 --> 22:34.875
I'll say it next time I see you.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.754
Drive carefully, and don't forget
to fasten your condom.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.552
- Dad!
- Seat belt!

22:40.680 --> 22:43.399
I meant-- I meant
seat belt.

22:43.520 --> 22:47.752
Um, I'm putting your father to bed.
This has been a very big night for him.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.552
- Bye.
- Okay.
- Well, good night.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.999
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Good night.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.714
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Have fun.
- Bye.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.788
This is a great kid.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.434
- It'll never last.
- Wanna bet?

23:01.560 --> 23:03.835
Nina, Annie's much too spirited
for this kid.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.316
He's totally wrong for her.
I give it two months, tops. One month.

23:07.440 --> 23:10.238
This is the right guy for Annie, George.
I'm telling you, I feel it in my bones.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.396
- I mean, we're two lucky parents.
We are.
- Lucky? Oh!

23:12.520 --> 23:15.398
What about his laugh? It was such
a giveaway. It was so phoney with his--

23:16.520 --> 23:18.511
- I thought it was totally sincere.
- Oh, please.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.313
What about that little rehearsed speech
he gave? It was right out of a book.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.351
How To Grease Your Future
Mother-ln-Law.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.790
You're off here, George,
really. I thought it was
completely from his heart.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.036
- Why do you think I cried?
- Good question.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.515
I don't know why either of you cried.
I'm losing my voice.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.632
- Are my glands swollen or something?
- Let me see. No. No, honey, no.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.512
And what about
the way he kept touching her?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.915
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean what do I mean?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.110
- He could-- He couldn't
keep his hands off her.
- Oh, yes. Kind of like...

23:41.240 --> 23:44.630
when we were engaged, except that
wasn't all you couldn't keep off me.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.718
That was different.
And we certainly never
acted that way in your parents' house.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.230
Ah! You want me to name all the rooms
we did it in at my parents' house?

23:51.360 --> 23:53.920
That was different.
We were like two imbeciles.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.634
- This is our child we're talking about.
- Our child? Oh, George.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.594
You know, I still think you see Annie
as a seven-year-old in pigtails.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.358
Well, you know, that just shows
how much you know about me...

24:02.480 --> 24:04.835
because that is not at all
how I see her.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.554
Right, a seven-year-old
with pigtails.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.513
I mean, here's the thing: We have
no idea who this Bryan really is.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.359
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- I mean, if that's his real name.
I mean, who knows?

24:13.480 --> 24:16.836
You know, maybe he already has a wife.
You read about these cases every day--

24:16.960 --> 24:20.635
you know, men who have wives and
families stashed all across the country.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.672
I mean, he could be a professional
con artist who meets innocents abroad...

24:23.800 --> 24:28.351
and gives them this song and dance about
being an independent whatever that was.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.438
And then skips out after bilking them
for all they're worth.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.199
- Wh-What are you doing?
- I'm getting ready for bed.

24:34.320 --> 24:37.073
You know, then I suppose you're not
interested that I believe
I remember seeing someone...

24:37.200 --> 24:39.634
who looked like Bryan's twin
on America's Most Wanted.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.877
You're right.
I'm not.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.195
George.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.197
George, l-l thought he was great.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.595
I liked him a lot.
And I'm really ha-- Ann--

24:49.720 --> 24:53.190
George, will you please stop making
that face? I'm very happy for Annie.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.754
I'm excited for her.
This is a big deal.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.395
I think that we should
at least hug.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.034
This is great news.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.037
Oh, a wedding.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.352
Father of the bride.
Can you believe it?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.275
Forty-eight hours later,
the wedding was still on...

25:21.400 --> 25:24.597
and we were on our way to Bel-Air
to meet Bryan's folks.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.995
I don't know why we have to have
brunch with total strangers.

25:27.120 --> 25:31.159
Because their son is marrying
our daughter and it's not
an unusual custom meeting the in-laws.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.556
You know, that's another thing.
I hate that expression: in-laws.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.990
What does it mean anyway?
We're legally bound to these people?

25:38.120 --> 25:42.033
I don't wanna be "in-lawed," especially
to people who live in Bel-Air.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.675
I mean, what kind of people
have brunch and live in Bel-Air?

25:45.800 --> 25:48.109
Rich people.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.279
They probably live in the one shack
in the middle of all these mansions.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.198
- Nice mood, George.
- What? I'm in a good mood.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.512
Okay, I think this is it.
Yeah.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.158
- Nice shack, babe.
- Worse. It's the biggest house
on the street.

26:08.280 --> 26:11.750
Now we're related to
pretentious snobs. Just what we need.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.034
You look very handsome, George,
way too young to be in-lawed.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.789
Well, it really shouldn't matter
how I look. We're not here
to win their approval.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.398
Just because you
changed your outfit five times.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.351
Oh, and you didn't try on
nine different shirts?

26:46.480 --> 26:47.754
- Two.
- Two.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.518
Two long-sleeve,
two short-sleeve.

26:49.640 --> 26:53.030
- Hi!
- George, Nina, welcome.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.479
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- I'm John.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.717
- How do you do?
- Hi, I'm Joanna.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.159
- Welcome. Come in, please.
- Welcome to our house. Come on in.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.113
- Come in.
- Thank you so much. Well.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.869
All I could think about
was the size of this place.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.389
We could've parked our whole house
in the foyer.

27:08.520 --> 27:12.069
Ah, what a nerve-racking thing,
meeting your future in-laws.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.270
- Yeah.
- What a relief. You two
look perfectly normal.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.915
Oh, well, I am.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.759
I have to tell you,
we got so nervous about today...

27:20.880 --> 27:24.429
about meeting the two of you,
l-l must've tried
on three different outfits.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.393
- Oh.
- I changed my shirt four times.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.991
- Can you imagine anyone
being that jerky?
- Oh, I know.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.951
So, come on in. I thought
we'd have lunch in here.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.469
- Oh, what a great room.
- Marta.
- Thank you, Marta.

27:36.600 --> 27:41.071
Marta, estos son nuestros in-laws,
George and Nina Banks.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.077
- Hello.
- How do you do? Hi.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.715
Oh, and here's
the rest of our family.

27:46.840 --> 27:50.594
Oh, don't worry. They look like killers,
but they're actually quite friendly.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.518
As long as you're relaxed,
why, they're relaxed.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.438
Hi, puppy, puppy, puppy.
Why, you're--

27:56.560 --> 27:59.552
All right, fellas, that's enough.
Go on. Release! Good boys.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.511
- Well, why don't we all sit down.
- Please.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.676
- Oh, thank you.
- All right. Here we go.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.917
- George. Honey.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.634
I don't know if the kids told you, but
we were over in Europe on business...

28:09.760 --> 28:11.990
and we stopped in Rome
to see Bryan.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.430
So we got to spend a few days
with Annie. Oh, boy!

28:15.560 --> 28:18.632
- We just fell in love
with her immediately.
- Isn't she great?

28:18.760 --> 28:20.830
Yes. We just couldn't
be happier about this.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.599
How did you, uh,
take the news, George?

28:23.720 --> 28:25.597
Me?

28:25.720 --> 28:29.633
Uh, truthfully, uh, I was
a little surprised.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.752
- I was shocked.
- So was l.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.314
After all, they'd only known each other
a few months.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.908
Exactly. And Annie's
just finishing up school.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.110
Absolutely. Oh, believe me,
I tossed and turned over this one...

28:40.240 --> 28:43.073
but the bottom line
is they're in love.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.839
They're over 21, and whether they're
rushing into this or not...

28:45.960 --> 28:48.110
may be not for us to say.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.755
Right. "Not for us to say."
We're only their parents.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.838
I was about to say these very words
out loud when he hit me with--

28:54.960 --> 28:57.713
Yeah, sooner or later,
you just have to let your kids go...

28:57.840 --> 28:59.717
and hope you
brought 'em up right.

29:02.760 --> 29:06.275
George. Nina. Darling.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.436
This guy was making
a little too much sense for me.

29:08.560 --> 29:12.314
Suddenly my shirt collar felt like
it was starting to strangle me.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.476
To George and Nina...

29:14.600 --> 29:16.909
and a future
of wonderful memories.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.156
First, the wedding
of our children...

29:19.280 --> 29:22.317
and the happiness we'll share
watching their lives.

29:22.440 --> 29:25.830
Then sharing the joy
of our grandchildren together.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.675
Birthday parties,
graduation--

29:36.920 --> 29:40.708
Now I knew where they got the
expression "like father, like son."

29:40.840 --> 29:44.116
- I also knew I needed some air.
- Can you tell me where the restroom is?

29:44.240 --> 29:47.789
Oh, actually, the one down here
is a mess. We're remodelling.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.754
Uh, why don't you try
the one at the top of the stairs?
It's the seventh door on the left.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.552
- Second?
- Seventh.

29:53.680 --> 29:56.797
- Seventh.
- Seventh.

31:15.760 --> 31:19.150
I'm leaving.
I'm relaxed, and I'm leaving.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.318
Relent.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.670
Re-- Recoil.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.313
Reverse.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.590
- Well, I hope George hasn't
gotten lost up there.
- Oh, no, he's gonna be fine.

31:52.720 --> 31:55.280
Okay.

31:55.400 --> 31:59.075
Well, um--
Such a lovely sculpture.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.873
Oh. Doesn't it have a wonderful
sense of motion?

32:02.000 --> 32:05.436
We got it in Denmark. All the-- Quite
a lot of my family's from Copenhagen.

32:05.560 --> 32:09.189
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah. Doesn't it have
a wonderful sense of balance?

32:09.320 --> 32:11.311
- Oh, it's amazing.
- I was going to put it in the garden.

32:16.480 --> 32:19.199
Well, actually, uh, uh, Bryan spent
quite a few summers in Denmark.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.551
Uh, he now speaks
better Danish than, than Joanna.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.952
N-- Is that a fact?

32:37.200 --> 32:39.236
And we're planning a trip
back this summer.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.237
I think this is
a very beautiful spread here.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.397
- Oh, thank you.
- Well, shall--
should we wait for George?

33:10.240 --> 33:13.437
- Maybe I should, uh, check on George.
- No.

33:30.320 --> 33:34.711
- Release!
- Oh, man.

33:38.280 --> 33:42.193
Wow. No kidding?
Really? It went great?

33:42.320 --> 33:45.949
Uh, better than great. I mean, it, just,
just couldn't have gone better.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.036
God, I'm so relieved.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.277
I mean, who knows what can happen
at these things, you know?

33:51.400 --> 33:54.039
- This is great.
- Now I feel like the wedding's
officially on.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.037
Um, Dad, that looks so good.
This looks great.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.914
Um, Bryan's mom called with the names
of her immediate family.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.112
- Is this a joke?
- Not only is it not a joke...

34:08.239 --> 34:10.389
but eight of them are
from Copenhagen and well...

34:10.520 --> 34:13.114
it's the bride's family's
responsibility to--

34:13.239 --> 34:15.833
Do you have any idea what
a round-trip ticket from Denmark costs?

34:15.960 --> 34:17.951
Try eight round-trip tickets.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.956
Well, actually, it's nine.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.389
You see, Joanna's,
uh, cousin Gitte...

34:22.520 --> 34:27.310
is apparently a rather large woman
so she needs two seats.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.193
She can lop over into the aisle for all
I care 'cause there's no way I'm pay--

34:30.320 --> 34:31.594
Hi, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.472
- Hi.
- That's okay.
- How're you doing? Hi.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.397
- Hello.
- Hey, dude.
- Hi.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.273
- Oh. Here you are.
- Oh. Well, thank you.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.156
- It's "you're welcome" in Danish.
- Ah, thanks.

34:43.280 --> 34:47.159
This looks great. I hear you're
a whiz at the barbecue, Dad.

34:50.159 --> 34:54.676
Well. So have you two given any thought
to what kind of wedding you want?

34:54.800 --> 34:58.031
- Well, we've talked about it.
- Yes, and what do you think?

34:58.160 --> 34:59.718
Big? Small? Or--

34:59.840 --> 35:02.070
Well, it can't be too big.
We don't have that many friends.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.430
So we're talking
in the small vicinity, then?

35:04.560 --> 35:07.074
Well, no, she didn't say "small."
She said not too big.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.668
Yeah, but nothing fancy
or overblown, right?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.438
- Right.
- Right.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.358
So kind of the "less is more"
theory, huh, Annie?

35:14.480 --> 35:18.268
- Basically.
- The reason I'm asking all these
questions is I have a great idea...

35:18.400 --> 35:23.235
where we can have this lovely,
not small but not too big wedding.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.920
You do? Where?

35:26.040 --> 35:29.191
At our favourite restaurant, the place
we've been eating at for 15 years.

35:29.320 --> 35:33.757
The best.
The Steak Pit.

35:33.880 --> 35:37.429
- Dad, get serious.
- I don't think
you want the word "pit"...

35:37.560 --> 35:40.028
on a wedding invitation,
George.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.879
Really, Dad, a rib joint
with sawdust on the floor...

35:43.000 --> 35:45.389
isn't exactly what I had in mind
for my wedding.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.078
- No offence.
- Well, excuse me.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.156
What did you have in mind,
the Beverly Hills Hotel?

35:49.280 --> 35:52.317
No. Actually, what I'd like
is to have...

35:52.440 --> 35:54.670
my wedding in a church
and have the reception here.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.392
- Oh.
- That's what I was hoping for.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.397
Here?

36:05.600 --> 36:08.717
Don't I have
the greatest Dad in the world?

36:08.840 --> 36:11.070
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.636
- Can we have some burgers?
- Okay, here's the bride burger
and your groom burger.

36:14.760 --> 36:17.638
And, uh, enjoy 'em. Now, go on
over there and see the jugglers.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.274
My dream wedding,
a barbecue wedding.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.950
- This is a better idea
than the Steak Pit.
- Yeah.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.516
We'll get some, uh, picnic tables
and, uh, crepe paper and balloons.

36:33.640 --> 36:38.031
You know, invite all our best pals.
I'll make my famous guacamole.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.516
A wedding at home.
This is a great idea.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.399
Great idea. Picnic tables, crepe paper,
balloons, you at the barbecue.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.829
- Oh, George.
- What don't you like about that?

36:50.960 --> 36:54.191
Why have you been
acting so crazy since the moment
Annie told you she was getting married?

36:54.320 --> 36:56.959
You know, I haven't been acting crazy.
I've simply acted...

36:57.080 --> 36:59.640
Iike any normal,
red-blooded American dad.

36:59.760 --> 37:03.639
Normal? Uh-huh. Okay.
Falling in the MacKenzie's pool.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.990
Suggesting the Steak Pit
as a wedding reception.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.510
Oh, watching America's Most Wanted
every night, looking for Bryan's face.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.394
And now this picnic scenario.
George, a wedding is a big deal!

37:13.520 --> 37:16.353
Everybody seems to understand this
but you. And as a matter of fact--

37:16.480 --> 37:20.393
N-Now don't go nuts when I tell
you this, but when Bryan's mom...

37:20.520 --> 37:23.353
called with her list, she
suggested that they might just wanna...

37:23.480 --> 37:25.471
pitch in and help
with the cost of the wedding.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.115
You know, hey, we may not have a house
the size of Rhode lsland,
but we're not poverty-stricken.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.118
We can certainly afford to give
our daughter a proper wedding.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.357
Proper. Not you in a chef's hat,
right, George?

37:35.480 --> 37:38.074
- Who said anything about a chef's hat?
When did this come up?
- Yes, but I know you.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.668
I'm close. Oh, look.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.030
I just really saw this
whole thing differently.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.720
Like, I wanted to call a wedding
coordinator to make the whole thing...

37:45.840 --> 37:48.718
really, really beautiful, and you want
to call Gabe at the Steak Pit.

37:48.840 --> 37:52.037
Wait a minute. Wedding coordinator?
What's a wedding coordinator?

37:52.160 --> 37:55.630
- A person who coordinates weddings.
- What's to coordinate?

37:55.760 --> 37:59.719
Well, there's the invitations
and the flowers, the food,
the band, the photographer.

37:59.840 --> 38:03.628
George, why are you
giving me that look again? A lot
of people hire wedding coordinators.

38:03.760 --> 38:08.276
Nina, you and I run
successful businesses. We can certainly
pull together one smallish wedding.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.311
- Yeah, okay.
- We don't need
some fancy wedding coordinator.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.876
Okay, George, then
let's just forget it, okay? Because,
you know, I just really can't take this.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.389
- I'm not used to all this
arguing, so just, uh--
- Fine. I don't want to argue.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.876
Just-- Do me a favour, okay, George?
Just go on upstairs and I'll...

38:20.000 --> 38:22.514
- finish up down here.
- Fine. Fine. I'll go upstairs.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.518
However, I would like
to remind you what happened
to what's-his-name down the street.

38:25.640 --> 38:28.200
His daughter got married and the thing
practically broke him. Remember?

38:28.320 --> 38:30.390
- I remember.
- You and I could end up...

38:30.520 --> 38:33.398
shuffling along the sidewalk
in our bathrobes.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.950
- That was a joke.
- Hilarious.

38:39.080 --> 38:43.073
Oh, all right. I'll go.
I'll meet the wedding coordinator.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.794
You know I don't want to,
but I'll go...

38:45.920 --> 38:48.480
if you still want me to go,
all right?

38:48.600 --> 38:51.876
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.629
Now, let me do the talking,
girls, okay?

38:55.760 --> 38:57.637
Well, I negotiate better than you.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.432
- Now what's this guy's name?
- Franck.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.278
- Frank.
- Franck.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.719
- Franck?
- Franck.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.719
- Franck. Franck. Franck.
- Oh, this is it.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.070
Okay, here we go.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.431
- Ah, Mom.
- No. No. This is just--

39:12.560 --> 39:14.630
- Oh, my, Annie.
- This is amazing.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.512
- Look. Look at this trim.
- What?

39:16.640 --> 39:18.312
- Oh!
- Isn't this beautiful? Pearls.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.908
- Oh!
- Oh, gee.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.429
-Oh, wow. I love how they did this, Mom.
-Annie.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.959
- Yeah?
- Do you like this place setting?

39:25.080 --> 39:27.150
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- That china also comes...

39:27.280 --> 39:29.475
in a wonderful Sara Lee yellow.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.956
- Hi. You must be Franck?
- I wish.

39:33.080 --> 39:36.072
I'm Franck's assistant,
Howard Weinstein.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.430
-Well, I'm Nina Banks and this is Annie.
-Hello.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.630
- Hi. Hi.
- Oh.
- The bride, and, uh...

39:40.760 --> 39:43.228

39:47.480 --> 39:50.870

39:51.000 --> 39:56.199

42:12.120 --> 42:16.671

A cake, Franck, is made
of flour and water.

42:24.480 --> 42:27.278
- My first car didn't cost $1,200
- George.

42:27.400 --> 42:32.918
Well, welcome to the '90s,
Moster Bonks.

42:33.040 --> 42:36.112
Not only did I not understand
a syllable this guy was saying...

42:36.240 --> 42:38.196
now I had the feeling
he was putting me down.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.437
Excuse me, um, Franck.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.471
- Could we please have a second?

42:43.600 --> 42:47.798
Take two seconds. Howard,
letz return calls. Could we--

42:50.160 --> 42:53.357
All right, George, what's the problem?
Do you want to leave?

42:53.480 --> 42:55.596
- Do you?
- No. I like him.

42:55.720 --> 42:59.508
I think he's going to make this
a beautiful wedding.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.437
Don't look at me.
You guys decide.

43:01.560 --> 43:05.712
Give the man a chance, George, please.
Annie, do you like this cake?

43:05.840 --> 43:09.150
It is incredible, Dad.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.077
- Well, all right.
But, look, let's just--
- I know.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.236
We-- We're going to, George.
We're gonna hold things down.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.272
- We just-- We won't go nuts.
- No. No.
- Thank you.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.277
- Franck!
- Coming!

43:21.840 --> 43:25.071
- We'll take the cake.
- Oh, good, good.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.634
Don't worry, Moster Bonks. I'm gonna
bring de crew over to the house.

43:27.760 --> 43:30.672
We gif everything that we haf
in the once-over department...

43:30.800 --> 43:32.995
and then in the end you be
vary, vary happy, trust me.

43:33.120 --> 43:37.079
- You just smile away.
Now, interesting idea.
- Yes.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.795
Wit regard to thame and kolor
of de wedding, dis is how I see it:

43:40.920 --> 43:43.434
I think we go vary elegant,
inside de tent, you know--

43:43.560 --> 43:46.438
With one swift move,
I'd been cut out of the deal.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.471
Annie, Nina and Franck
were in charge now.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.999
...and bootiful china--

43:50.120 --> 43:53.430
Now, spo! And crystal
to drop over dead for!

43:53.560 --> 43:56.438
Old Dad was history.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.393
- ...new machine to work now.
- A few days later, I was at work...

43:59.520 --> 44:01.511
relieved for once not to be
talking about the wedding.

44:01.640 --> 44:04.598
- I wore those 750-trainers
over the weekend.
- They still stiff?

44:04.720 --> 44:08.395
- I think they need a soft--
- Just back from the Orient, ladies,
and I got a new shipment.

44:08.520 --> 44:12.308
Beautiful merchandise.
Gucci, Cartier, Louis Vuitton.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.112
- I never heard of Louis Vuitton.
- I don't know.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.312
He's big, darling, believe me, or they
wouldn't be knocking 'em off.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.953
Don't worry, Mr Banks,
they're on a break.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.991
- That's okay.
- George, Franck's office, line two.

44:21.120 --> 44:24.510
Uh, maybe I could see those mockups
by Friday, then, Dave? Thanks.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.676
This was the call I'd been dreading
since the moment I heard...

44:26.800 --> 44:29.189
the words, "wedding coordinator."

44:29.320 --> 44:32.392
- Hello.
- Mr Banks, this is Howard Weinstein...

44:32.520 --> 44:34.351
Franck's executive assistant.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.199
I have-- estimate for you.

44:37.320 --> 44:40.118
- I can barely hear you!
- I'm in my car...

44:40.240 --> 44:42.595
going through ...water Canyon.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.676
- Call you back?
- No, no, no! l-l want the estimate.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.677
How much?
What's the damage?

44:46.800 --> 44:51.032
For everything from the flowers
to the honeymoon limo--

44:51.160 --> 44:53.071
Okay, everything.
How much?

44:53.200 --> 44:56.112
--dred --ifty head.

44:56.240 --> 44:59.630
You're breaking up. It sounded like
you said 150 a head.

44:59.760 --> 45:01.637
No! No!

45:01.760 --> 45:06.629
- Good. I was about to kill myself.
- It's 250 a head.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.874
- Get me Nina at work.
- She just called.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.629
- I need the final headcount.
- She just gave it to me.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.832
What is it? One-fifty?

45:21.960 --> 45:23.837
572.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.514
$250 a head means for the four of us to
attend this wedding in our own home...

45:31.640 --> 45:33.596
will cost $1,000.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.312
Therefore, we are not
getting up from this table...

45:35.440 --> 45:37.749
until we cut this list down
to the bare minimum.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.599
Now, invite as many people as you want
to the church, pack 'em in...

45:40.720 --> 45:43.154
build a grandstand if you want,
but we are not having...

45:43.280 --> 45:46.716
more than 150 people in this house
on the day of the wedding.

45:46.840 --> 45:51.755
-All right. Now let's start eliminating.
-Okay, Jim Pepper and wife.

45:51.880 --> 45:56.158
- Oh, great. Start with one of my guys.
- Fine. We'll start with one of mine.
I'll cut Steve and Stephanie Turrill.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.350
- They're very good
clients of mine. They're--
- Say no more. They're history.

45:58.480 --> 46:01.199
- All right. Jim Pepper and wife.
- I've known the guy for 20 years.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.117
You haven't seen him
in 15, George.

46:03.240 --> 46:05.037
All right. I'll say
I lost his address.

46:05.160 --> 46:09.153
Now here's somebody-- your cousin Betsy,
the poet/waitress/picture framer.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.875
We can't cut family.
They know about the wedding.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.391
I only invited one person: Cameron.
Mom said I could have a friend there.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.954
For 250 bucks, you can see Cameron
after the wedding.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.436
All right. Very good.
Five down. We're rolling.

46:23.560 --> 46:26.199
All right. What about Harry Kirby?
We haven't seen him in ages.

46:26.320 --> 46:29.949
- I don't know.
- Didn't Harry Kirby die last year?

46:30.080 --> 46:31.832
Yes! Good!

46:33.720 --> 46:36.439
Oh, uh, sorry.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.074
- Who's Franck Eggelhoffer?
- What?

46:39.200 --> 46:42.033
He's coordinating the wedding,
and then we're not going to invite him?

46:42.160 --> 46:44.958
Exactly! Do you think
I'm gonna pay a guy 15%%%...

46:45.080 --> 46:49.471
plus an hourly, plus an additional $500
to feed him and that assistant of his?

46:49.600 --> 46:53.991
- Have you lost your mind?
- Can I put Cameron back on the list
if he promises not to eat?

46:54.120 --> 46:57.556
You know, that's not a bad idea.
Who else can we ask not to eat?

46:57.680 --> 46:59.557
My parents, your mother.

46:59.680 --> 47:04.196
Why don't we just charge people? That
way we can make money on the wedding.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.231
Annie. A--

47:10.520 --> 47:13.193
I was kidding.

47:57.160 --> 48:00.152
"How to give a beautiful wedding
on a small budget.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.354
"Bake your own wedding cake.

48:05.480 --> 48:10.076
"Find a good tailor and copy
a designer dress.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.760
Have a friend take the pictures."

48:21.560 --> 48:27.032
From that moment on, I decided
to shut my mouth and go with the flow.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.590
My first move was to get
the old tuxedo out of mothballs.

49:13.440 --> 49:17.274
Hey! Lookin' good, my man.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.436
Get down! Hey!

49:19.560 --> 49:24.350
What's new, pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

49:24.480 --> 49:28.359
What's new, pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa

49:28.480 --> 49:30.755
- Whoa, whoa
- George!

49:30.880 --> 49:32.996
- Hey
- Annie, he's up here.

49:33.120 --> 49:37.830
Pussycat, pussycat
I love you

49:37.960 --> 49:40.110
'Deed I do

49:40.240 --> 49:42.390
Yes, I do

49:42.520 --> 49:45.830
Hey, what do you think?
Bought it in '75 and it still fits.

49:47.560 --> 49:51.678
- Like a glove.
- Yes. It's just, it's a real way to go.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.756
Um, maybe--

49:55.400 --> 49:58.756
Maybe you could get a new tux.
Uh, we're all wearing new clothes, and--

49:58.880 --> 50:01.838
What? Don't you think I look cute?
I mean, there will be a lot
of single gals there.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.435
- I'll get it.
- Oh, oh.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.711
Oh, by the way. Good news.
The church is free.

50:09.840 --> 50:14.550
- Oh, finally something is free.
- I meant available.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.477
Oh, I like that. It's very good.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.352
Adorable.

50:18.480 --> 50:23.110
Oh, they've done the shutters. It's like
kind of an I Remember Mama touch.

50:23.240 --> 50:26.516
Oh, it"s very nice.
We change it all though. Let's go.

50:26.640 --> 50:31.714
Franck and his crew had arrived to
finalize all the details of the wedding.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.832
First was an audition for a band singer.

50:34.960 --> 50:39.158
Volare
Oh, oh

50:39.280 --> 50:42.397
Cantare
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

50:43.680 --> 50:45.910
No wonder
Annie's happy heart sings

50:46.040 --> 50:48.759
Bryan's love has given her wings
Hey!

50:48.880 --> 50:50.677
Like birds of a feather
A rainbow together--

50:50.800 --> 50:54.076
Just as I was about to say, "Don't
call us, we'll call you," I heard...

50:54.200 --> 50:57.829
Howard, we'll huf to move out all de
furniture to huf any sort of room to--

50:57.960 --> 51:01.077
Oh. Dis is a nice statement.

51:01.200 --> 51:04.317
It's lots of fun.
Mrs Bonks, one kvestion--

51:04.440 --> 51:07.352
Howard, uh, Franck was saying something
about moving out the furniture.

51:07.480 --> 51:10.597
We have to move it all out
if we're going to fit
more than 200 bodies in here.

51:10.720 --> 51:14.190
- But what if someone wants to sit down?
- We bring in chairs.

51:14.320 --> 51:17.915
Well, if you're bringing in chairs, then
why are you moving the furniture out?

51:18.040 --> 51:21.396
Mr Bonks, I do dis for a loving,
you know? Trust me.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.511
A movink van must tek everything out.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.835
It's an extra expense. Oh, sure.
Yah, yah.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.837
Bot we need it. Annie!

51:27.960 --> 51:30.793
Mrs Bonks. Come this way, please.
So, vhat do you think of the zinger?

51:30.920 --> 51:32.956
- We do have other choizes.
- I'd like to see 'em.

51:33.080 --> 51:36.117
Good. That'll be no problem.

51:36.240 --> 51:40.028
My caterer, everyone, and my best friend
in the whole world, Hanck Kucinetzki.

51:41.320 --> 51:42.389
Hi.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.431

51:48.080 --> 51:50.799

51:50.920 --> 51:54.629

51:54.760 --> 51:57.194

52:15.240 --> 52:18.277
Oh, really?
I have a problem with that.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.868
- With what?
- With veal. I keep reading...

52:21.000 --> 52:23.639
there's a lot of inhumane treatment
in the way they treat the calves.

52:23.760 --> 52:26.558
I read that too.
You're very chic. No voll.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.357
So that leafs seafoot,
which is also chic.

52:31.480 --> 52:33.277
Or fowl, which is not chic
but chip.

52:33.400 --> 52:38.952
Cheap. Finally a word I understood.
My first and last piece of good news.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.718
- Mrs Banks?
- Yes?

52:40.840 --> 52:44.355
One last thing.

52:44.480 --> 52:47.597
- What is he doing?
- We need more amps
to light the house and the tent.

52:47.720 --> 52:51.395
- It's cheaper
than bringing in a new line.
- In terms of the florals out front...

52:51.520 --> 52:54.159
we're gonna color coordinate
with the swans, right?

52:54.280 --> 52:56.032
- Swans?
- I think it'd be wonderful.
- Perfect.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.151
- We're having swans?
- Franck thought it would be great...

52:58.280 --> 53:00.919
to have swans waddling around
the tulip border, you know,
as the guests enter.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.350
- It would be really sweet.
- Nina, we don't have a tulip border.
- You will.

53:06.360 --> 53:07.759
How much is--

53:07.880 --> 53:10.189
Mr Bonks,
ve huff problus.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.356
Hanck does not vant
no vay to prepare chuckun.

53:12.480 --> 53:16.632
- He doesn't what?
- Franck, does the tent connect
through here?

53:16.760 --> 53:19.638
I've been meaning to fix that.
You have to push, then pull.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.633
Oh.

53:24.760 --> 53:27.479
Oh, now les not panic
about anything. Les see.

53:27.600 --> 53:30.672
Oh. Oh, that-- Eww. That's only
a sem. We cun fix that.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.995
Now, Mr Bonks, please,
about the seafoot.

53:33.120 --> 53:35.429
Hanck vants to know
if it's hokay or not hokay.

53:35.560 --> 53:41.032
No, Franck.
Tell Hanck it's not okay.

53:41.160 --> 53:44.596
If I have to move out
all the furniture and add amps...

53:44.720 --> 53:49.635
and repaint the walls and get
a new tux and pay for swans...

53:49.760 --> 53:53.116
then I'd like
the "chipper" chicken.

53:53.240 --> 53:58.030
- Is that clear?
- I understood the "chipper" part. Yeah.

54:09.840 --> 54:13.037
Hokay. Dat's it. Hanck says
he will think about dis.

54:13.160 --> 54:15.151
Now, we do not vant
to louse him.

54:15.280 --> 54:19.956
He is a ganius, and
ve need his mand. Hokay? So.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.914
I'll see vhat I can do.
Hanck? Hanck!

54:25.680 --> 54:27.796
I'm fine.

54:28.880 --> 54:31.440
Anyway, where were we? Oh.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.437
- Yes.
- I see you're starting to lose it.

54:33.560 --> 54:35.710
But I have one more question.
Very minor. I'll say it quickly.

54:35.840 --> 54:38.832
Parking attendants. Four is comfortable.
Three is acceptable. Anything less...

54:38.960 --> 54:41.474
- absolutely terrifies me.
- Two.

54:41.600 --> 54:44.160
- Two.
- George--
- Two.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.953
Hanck says if you vant the fowl,
he vasn't interested. He passes.

54:47.080 --> 54:50.550
He-- He passes?
ls he gonna do our cake?

54:50.680 --> 54:52.238
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

54:52.360 --> 54:54.874
Hi. I came to get my sneakers.
I left them in Annie's room last night.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.232
I was beginning to feel like I was
having an out-of-body experience.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.430
I had to get out
of the house and fast.

55:06.200 --> 55:08.191
Nina said as long as
I was escaping, would I mind...

55:08.320 --> 55:10.880
escaping to the market
and picking up something for dinner?

55:11.000 --> 55:14.151
Sure. That was all I needed.
A busy supermarket.

55:14.280 --> 55:17.590
I needed to drive, mellow out,
get my mind off the wedding.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.200
But mellowing out
was not in the cards.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.914
Here we go.
Here we go. Yeah.

55:28.320 --> 55:32.438
- Excuse me, sir. What are you doing?
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

55:32.560 --> 55:36.678
I want to buy eight hot dogs
and eight hot dog buns to go with them.

55:36.800 --> 55:40.873
But no one sells eight hot dog buns.
They only sell twelve hot dog buns.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.355
So I end up paying
for four buns I don't need.

55:43.480 --> 55:46.313
So I am removing
the superfluous buns.

55:46.440 --> 55:49.557
I-l'm sorry, sir, but you're gonna
have to pay for all twelve buns.

55:49.680 --> 55:52.877
- They're not marked individually.
- Yeah.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.232
And you wanna know why? Because some
big shot over at the wiener company...

55:57.360 --> 56:00.670
got together with some big shot
over at the bun company...

56:00.800 --> 56:02.756
and decided to rip off
the American public.

56:02.880 --> 56:06.475
Because they think the American public
is a bunch of trusting nitwits...

56:06.600 --> 56:09.751
- who'll pay for things they don't need
rather than make a stink.
- Get me security.

56:09.880 --> 56:12.394
Well, they're not ripping off
this nitwit anymore...

56:12.520 --> 56:14.988
because I'm not paying
for one more thing I don't need.

56:15.120 --> 56:18.032
George Banks is saying no!

56:18.160 --> 56:19.718
Who's George Banks?

56:22.240 --> 56:24.435
Me!

56:24.560 --> 56:27.233
Uh, why don't we just
calm down now, sir?

56:27.360 --> 56:30.477
I'll tell you why "we" don't calm down.
Because you're not excited.

56:30.600 --> 56:34.036
It takes two people for a "we"
to calm down, doesn't it?

56:34.160 --> 56:38.392
Uh, that I don't know, sir. I'm just
the assistant manager of a supermarket.

56:38.520 --> 56:43.310
But I'll tell you this. If you don't
pipe down and pay for those buns...

56:43.440 --> 56:47.752
- I'm gonna call the police.
- Oh, right!

56:47.880 --> 56:49.791
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Right.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.319
- That's right.
- Hey.

56:51.440 --> 56:53.237
- Right.
- Hey! Hey, come here!

56:53.360 --> 56:54.713
- Uh-uh! Uh-uh!
- Come here!

56:54.840 --> 56:56.717
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

57:04.240 --> 57:08.756
That was the low point.
Flipping out over four hot dog buns.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.030
I couldn't figure out
why I'd gotten so nuts...

57:11.160 --> 57:13.196
why the wedding had me so unglued.

57:13.320 --> 57:16.437
Banks, your wife is here.

57:19.640 --> 57:24.919
- Aren't you going to let me out?
- She wants to talk to you first.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.952
- She wants to talk to me first?
- Thank you.

57:31.840 --> 57:35.196
Hello, George.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.515
Why do you look happy
to see me in here, Nina?

57:37.640 --> 57:41.474
Happy? No, no, no.
I'm not happy, George.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.477
You think I was happy to tell everyone
that I had to come...

57:43.600 --> 57:46.114
down to the city jail and bail you out
for stealing hot dog buns?

57:46.240 --> 57:48.800
- I wasn't stealing them--
- Ah!

57:48.920 --> 57:51.718
- I was having a little--
- Ah!

57:51.840 --> 57:53.717
I'm going to have to ask you
not to talk or I'll have to call...

57:53.840 --> 57:56.354
Officer What's-his-name
over there.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.953
You've been more
than I can handle, George.

58:01.080 --> 58:03.514
Annie's wedding is not
a conspiracy against you.

58:03.640 --> 58:07.349
It's just a wedding. People have them
every day in every country in the world.

58:07.480 --> 58:11.234
I know it's going to be expensive,
but we don't go to Europe.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.828
We don't own fancy cars.
I don't own expensive jewellery.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.713
So we can afford
to have a big wedding.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.478
Nina.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.750
I'll get you out of here
on one condition, Banks.

58:20.880 --> 58:24.919
That you agree to the following.
Now, repeat after me.

58:25.040 --> 58:28.112
I, George Stanley Banks...

58:30.960 --> 58:32.678
I, George Stanley Banks...

58:32.800 --> 58:37.157
promise to pull it together
and act my age. Promise.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.236
promise to pull it together
and act my age.

58:39.360 --> 58:44.354
I will stop hyperventilating, rolling my
eyes, unbuttoning my top collar button.

58:44.480 --> 58:48.951
- I don't unbutton my top collar--
- Oh yeah. No. You mean this bit, with--

58:49.080 --> 58:51.310
- Stop hyperventilating...
- Hyperventilating.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.192
- rolling my eyes, and, uh...
- Unbuttoning.

58:53.320 --> 58:55.276
unbuttoning
my top collar button.

58:55.400 --> 58:57.914
I will stop making faces in general,
and I will definitely stop...

58:58.040 --> 59:00.554
telling everybody I meet
how much this wedding is costing.

59:00.680 --> 59:04.673
I don't tell everyone
how much it costs!

59:04.800 --> 59:07.837
- He told you, right?
- 250 a head.

59:07.960 --> 59:11.157
Oh, well, thanks!

59:15.200 --> 59:18.431
I will try to remember
my daughter's feelings.

59:18.560 --> 59:24.351
And how with every roll of my eyes, I am
taking away a piece of her happiness.

59:24.480 --> 59:27.677
I love you, Nina.

59:27.800 --> 59:30.189
Just repeat the last part
for me, George.

59:30.320 --> 59:32.038
I will try to remember
my daughter's feelings...

59:32.160 --> 59:35.357
- That's right.
- and how with every roll of my eyes...

59:35.480 --> 59:38.995
I am taking away
a piece of her happiness.

59:39.120 --> 59:43.159
I love you too.
Let's go home, okay?

59:46.200 --> 59:48.509
- No!
- Hey, I'm gonna hold ya here!

59:48.640 --> 59:50.790
- Yes! Sweet!
- Come on, Matty. Let's go.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.275
Plan "B," Matty. Plan "B."

59:53.400 --> 59:55.868
Here we go! Hey!

59:56.000 --> 59:58.036
Okay, I got ya! I got ya!

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.230
- Midget slam!
- All right!

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.079
Annie! Bryan! Look,
you got a present.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.952
Our first present!
I can't believe it.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.798
Oh, our second one
should be here any minute.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.434
- Oh, wow. How do you know?
- Oh, my parents are bringing it over.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.675
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.360
Oh, this is, uh, when we give
the presents. Uh, great. Uh, good.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.471
- I'll be right back.
- Where's he goin'?

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.830
- Maybe he got a present for you.
- You know about this?

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.837
Uh, I haven't got a clue.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.956
- Look at this!
- This is for us? Thank you so much!

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.950
Yikes. A whole car.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.514
My dad's gotta see this!

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.752
Dad! Dad?

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.788
Dad, did you see
what the MacKenzies got us?

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.354
It's unbelievable. And you thought
you'd never have a new car.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.313
I know! What's that?

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.956
It's nothing. It's just a gift
I was thinking of giving you guys.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.629
You know, it's something you said
you didn't have but you wanted.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.115
Can I see it?

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.629
Yeah, you know, it's--

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.436
It's not the big,
big gift, of course.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.596
It's a cappuccino maker!

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.075
Supposed to be a good one.
That's what they said at the store.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.079
It's, uh, top of the line.
Makes great foam.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.475
I couldn't love anything more.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.992
Goin' to the chapel and we're

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.113
- My feelings exactly.
- Gonna get married

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.869
Goin' to the chapel and we're

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.834
- Gonna get married
- Wow!

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.350
Gee, I really love you and we're

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.597
Gonna get married

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.714
Goin' to the chapel of love

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.795
Spring is here

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.435
The sky is blue

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.519
Whoa, birds all sing

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.997
- As if they knew
- No.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.749
Today's the day

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.996
We'll say I do

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:38.796
And we'll never
be lonely any more

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.593
All right, Mr Banks.
Here you go.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.030
- A 40-long. It's gorgeous
even on the hanger.
- Because we're goin' to the chapel

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.039
- Now this is an actual Giorgio Armani,
the real McCoy.
- And we're gonna get married

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.391
- Don't ask how I got it,
but here it is.
- Goin' to the chapel

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:57.389
And we're gonna get married

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.115
Gee, I really love you
and we're

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.312
Gonna get married

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.151
Goin' to the chapel of love

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.476
Bells will ring

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.913
The sun will shine, whoa

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.270
I'll be his

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.118
- Nina, we have great friends,
you know that?
- And he'll be mine

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.710
I mean, these are not
your run-of-the-mill salad bowls.
Theses are primo gifts.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.673
- We'll love until
- As a matter of fact, I am so happy
we have decided to serve...

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.157
- The end of time, and we'll never
- the very chic but exponsive seafoot
at our very foshionable wotting.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.555
- Be lonely anymore
- Ah! The beautiful bride! Good news!

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.468
You have received another lovely,
too-good-to-be-true silver tea set.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.672
- What's the matter?
- Send it back.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.475
- Come on. What do you mean?
- Daddy, I'm not kidding!

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.477
Send them all back.
The wedding's off!

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.351
Anne? Annie?

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.598
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I'm not gonna marry Bryan.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.190
Okay, okay. Whatever you want
is okay with us.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.154
I feel so awful,
after everything you guys have done.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.794
And now
I have to undo it all.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.070
Don't worry about it. These things
get cancelled all the time.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.077
Your mother and I can
take care of everything.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.077
Okay.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.151
What happened?

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.229
- Another girl?
- No.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.310
- Now look at your shirt.
- Don't worry.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.591
No, it wasn't anything like that.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.032
It started out as nothing really.
He gave me a present.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.516
It's our eight-month anniversary
today, and he--

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.474
He gave me-- Just look.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.356
He said it was for me,
for our apartment.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.630
Just look.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.630
It's a blender.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.479
Yeah. Exactly.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:43.273
I mean, I didn't want to act thrown
or anything, but inside I was.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.960
I mean, I thought something
for the apartment. Maybe--

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.993
Maybe a new clock or a cool phone
or a great art book or something.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.157
But a blender?
I mean, what is this? 1958?

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.874
Give the little wife a blender?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.516
I mean, it scared me, you know.
In terms of his expectations.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.438
Oh, I started to freak out,
and he asked me what was wrong.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.835
And I asked him what a gift like this
was supposed to be telling me.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.235
And he said, "Nothing,"
and I didn't believe him.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.558
And we got into this big fight.
And he said I was overreacting.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.992
And I said, "Why would I overreact?
Nobody in my family overreacts."

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.430
And then he came up
with this totally absurd story...

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.393
this completely outrageous lie,
and I'm looking at him...

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.909
and I'm thinking,
"This man's a liar!"

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.873
- What did he lie about?
- Oh...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.355
actually it was
something about you.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.233
Me?

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.875
He said the day that you and Mom
went to go visit his folks--

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.912
It-- This is just--
This is so ridiculous.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.555
He said that you were snooping
around his-- his dad's desk.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.274
And that you somehow found
his dad's bankbook--

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.914
Oh, no, no. First he said you broke
some mirror in their bathroom.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.237
And then you found his dad's bankbook
and you somehow threw it in their pool!

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.955
I mean, it's too ridiculous!
The man lies!

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.230
Come in!

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.871
Annie, Bryan's downstairs.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.072
- I don't want to see him.
- He looks awful.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.430
Good.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.869
Excuse me.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.309
I thought maybe I should help
smooth things over.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.476
So I took Bryan out for a drink.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.434
Thought we could
have a talk, man-to-man.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.393
But as I sat there and listened
to his side of the story...

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.353
I realized this was
a golden opportunity.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.837
If I ever wanted to get rid
of Bryan MacKenzie, this was my chance.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.359
You know those banana shakes
she likes to make, right?

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.472
Well, that's why I thought
she'd like a blender.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.149
I guess I can see her point. I mean,
a blender does suggest a certain...

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.750
1950s reference
to sexual politics, but...

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.271
I swear, it never entered
my consciousness at the time.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.915
- I believe you.
- You do?

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.115
Would you tell Annie
that for me, Dad?

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.232
This was where I was gonna
lower the boom.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.114
But instead, I looked into his
weepy eyes and found my self saying--

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.552
- Sure, I'll tell her.
- Oh, good!

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.070
'Cause I know whatever you say
she'll believe.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.111
Not only was I not getting rid
of the kid...

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.118
I now found myself
talking him into staying.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.630
You know, Bryan,
Annie's a very passionate person.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.469
And passionate people tend
to overreact at time.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.037
Annie comes from a long line
of major overreactors.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.277
Me. I can definitely lose it.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.834
My mother. A nut.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.270
My grandfather.
Stories about him were legendary.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.072
The good news, however,
is that this overreacting...

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.158
tends to get proportionately less
by generation.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:48.670
So, your kids could be normal.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.599
As if that wasn't enough,
I went on.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.508
But on the upside,
with this passion...

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.393
comes great spirit
and individuality...

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.559
which is probably
one of the reasons you love Annie.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.240
That's what
I love most about her.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:11.158
That's when it hit me
like a Mack truck.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:16.035
Annie was just like me,
and Bryan was just like Nina.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.390
They were a perfect match.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.316
Dad, I can't believe
you took him out. What did he say?

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.828
I mean, you don't
have to tell me. What?

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.599
Honey, I just spent
an hour with Bryan, and...

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.756
believe me
when I tell you that...

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.077
this gift says nothing about
how he feels about you.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.715
It's just a--
just a thing to put in the kitchen.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.798
He thought you might want to blend
something one day, and that's all.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.356
- And you believe that?
- Completely.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:52.109
He's-- He's downstairs now. His heart
is breaking. Please go see him.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.511
And also,
that story he told you...

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.108
about me and the bankbook
and the swimming pool?

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.231
Yeah?

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.797
- What?
- It's-- It's true.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.073
- Oh, Bryan.
- Oh, Annie.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.919
Oh.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.031
I am so sorry
about the blender.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.674
And I see your point. It w-- It w--
It was incredibly insensitive of me.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.995
Oh, no, it's okay. I want it.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.558
Oh, it's my first anniversary present.
I'm-- I'm so sorry
about calling you a worm.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.831
- My dad told me.
- That's-- When I thought I was never
gonna see you again, I mean--

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.394
- If it wasn't for your father--
- I know. I know.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.511
- I love you.
- You too.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.112
Everything fine now?

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.837
Good. I'll just, uh, uh--

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.439
- Annie!
- Hi, Bryan. What's up?

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.028
- Well, we made it to January.
- Is that for us?

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.470
- It was the day before the big day.
- Sure. I'll be out in a sec.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.068
The Farmer's Almanac predicted this week
was going to be the coldest...

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.714
L.A. had seen
in over half a century.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.798
But we were so busy,
none of us had time to notice.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.276
Franck! Franck.
Franck, Franck, Franck.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.718
Sure, yes. We'll do the whole--
You like it?

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.717
Looks good, yeah.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.193
Right, together.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.192
Left, together.
Right, together.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.437
Left, together.
Right, together.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.915
Left--

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.153
Right, together.
Left, together.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.396
Hey, Matty. You're up pretty late,
aren't ya?

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.159
Yeah, I know.
I'm just practising.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.475
I wish I didn't have to
walk Mom down the aisle.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.830
Don't worry. You'll be great.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.157
Is it right, together, left
or left, together, right?

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.794
Well, let's try it.
Let's see, we go...

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.118
right, together,
left, together.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.313
Right, together,
left, together.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.237
Good.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.148
Matty, I'm sorry if I've been
preoccupied lately with this wedding.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.714
- It's okay.
- Yeah, but I have, haven't l?

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.637
It's all right.
I understand.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.433
- Yeah, but--
- Yeah, you have.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.869
But I haven't felt
ignored or anything.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.072
Don't worry, Dad.
No permanent damage done.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.237
- Oh, good.
- It's really cute and cozy.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.476
And in a great neighborhood.
You'll see it.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.636
I am really excited.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.594
I've got all this packing to do,
and this room looks so different.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.310
It's gonna be weird,
isn't it?

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.271
Just you, me
and Mom here now.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.479
Yeah. Come on.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.034
G'night, pal. Sleep tight.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.119
- Good luck tomorrow, Dad.
- Yeah, you too.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.196
- Annie?
- Yeah?

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.471
- G'night.
- G'night, Matty. I love you.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.875
I love you too.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.875
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.755
He's all I've wanted
all my life and even more

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.112
He smiled at me and
gee, the music started playing

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.472
"Here Comes The Bride"
when he walked through the door

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.515
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.634
The boy whose life and dream
and love I want to share

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.117
For on my hand a band of gold
appeared before me

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.915
The band of gold
I always dreamed I'd wear

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.908
When we kissed
I felt the sweet sensation

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.716
This time it wasn't
just my imagination

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.470
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.435
He's just what I've been waiting for
Oh, yes

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.951
With every kiss, oh
"This is it," my heart keeps saying

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.435
Today I met

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.156
The boy I'm going to marry

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.199
- Did I wake you?
- No, no. I was up.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.276
So, what are you doing?

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.470
I couldn't sleep.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.635
I just kept thinking about how this was
my last night in my bed, in my house.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.992
Kind of like
my last night as a kid.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.997
I mean, I've lived here
since I was five.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.318
And I feel like I'm supposed
to turn in my key tomorrow.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.396
It was so strange,
packing up my room.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:10.354
You know how you've always trained me
never to throw anything away.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.950
So, like, I have all these
ratty stuffed animals...

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.390
and yearbooks, my old retainer...

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.354
all my old magic tricks.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.313
I've actually packed it all.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.195
I just didn't want
to let it go.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.756
I mean, I know I can't stay.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.274
But it's like
I don't want to leave.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.792
Well, that's the thing about life,
is, uh...

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.956
the surprises.

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.710
The little things that sneak up
on you and grab hold of you.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:55.553
- It still happens to me.
- Thanks.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.038
- What is this?
- I don't believe it.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:08.029
- Oh, my God! Talk about surprises.
- It hasn't snowed in L.A.
since I was nine.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.196
Mom's gonna die.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.753
What? What is that face?

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.997
No. Nothing. I was--
I was just thinking.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.874
Oh, this is gonna end up
costing you more money.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.514
No.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.791
How I know I'll remember this moment
for the rest of my life.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.997
Whee!

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.199
When you live in a city that hasn't
seen snow in 36 years...

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.914
it's bound to cause a few problems.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.711
First, we panicked
and brought in extra heaters.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.071
But they were melting
the ice sculptures, so they had to go.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.349
- Right.
- Yeah?

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.233
- All right. Back in the truck.
- Yeah.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.478
The florist had to thaw out our
newly planted tulips with a hair dryer.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.193
Franck and Howard shovelled our path
themselves at no extra charge.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.151
- Franck?
- Just keep shovelling! Don't stop!

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.113
'Cause they're gonna be here, you know.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.550
And the swans spent the morning
in a lukewarm bath.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.672
Other than that, we were
almost running on schedule.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.191
- Nina, it's after 3:00!
- All I can say is thank God
snow is white.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:41.356
- It works. You know what I mean?
- It works.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.833
Franck, do you have
that needle and thread?

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.552
Here you go, George.
We fix you right up.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.752
- Howard, you better go to the church!
- On my way.

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.836
Uh-oh. I bring
the wrong kolor thread.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.349
I assumed you'd be wearing
a black tuxado.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.119
- It is a black tuxado.
- I don't think so, babe.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.630
This tux if nuffy blue.
No doubt about dat. Let me--

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.718
What are you talkin' about?
Armani doesn't make a blue tuxedo.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.115
Armani don't also make polyaster.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.477
Franck, where are the cars?
We're supposed to be there by now.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:13.036
Where are dos cares?

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.029
All right. Relax, honey.
Everything's going to be just fine.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.869
At least we know
they can't start without us.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.516
I knew I'd never be able to remember
what Nina wore that day.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.359
But I also knew I'd never forget
the way she looked.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.798
Nina.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.478
Thank you, George.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.875
You shouldn't look this beautiful.
It's not fair to the bride.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.710
- Cars is here!
- Huh?

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.195
Matthew, frond and cendre!

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.114
- Aw!
- Aw!

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.514
Just kidding.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.189
- Oh, no.
- What did you do to your hair, honey?

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.958
I gelled it. You don't like it?

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.310
N-- Oh, no, no. I think it--
it looks-- yeah-- cool.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.351
- Very debonair, my boy.
- Thank you.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.835
- Okay, we'll go in the first car,
and you and Annie follow.
- Right.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.838
- George.
- Oh, I follow! l-- Anne!

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.753
Annie?

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.030
I'm ready. Come on in.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.278
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.836
Okay. Let's get
this show on the road.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.550
- We're here!
- Oh! Oh, just look!

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.036
- Hi. Oh, Mom.
- Line up, everyone.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.549
- Mother of the bride.
- Oh, George!

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.717
Comin' through! Here we come.
Comin' through.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.274
- Left, together, right, together.
- Got it, Dad.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.789
- Let me see that.
- See?

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:20.196
Let's do this. Okay?
I love you.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.357
- I love you too.
- Mother of the bride.
Mother of the bride. We've gotta go.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.710
- George.
- Let's go, everybody. Line up.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.308
It's time. It's time.
Mother of the bride.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.954
Come on, mother of the bride.
Here we go. I'm opening the doors.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.231
Natasha, haven't you peeked enough?
Here we go. Come on. Let's go.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.073
Shh. Okay.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:49.513
And left, right.
Very nice. Smile now.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.508
Right and left.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:12.191
Right and very nice and left.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.392
Right. Keep smiling.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.194
And left. Hey.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.677
This was the moment I'd been dreading
for the past six months.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.475
Well, actually,
for the past 22 years.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.116
- Hold on, Dad.
- Annie overwhelmed me.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.233
She was as calm and cool as
I'd ever seen her. Very un-Banks-like.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.750
Okay.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.796
Here you go.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.436
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here together...

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.757
in the presence of family,
friends and loved ones...

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.871
for the purpose
of uniting in matrimony--

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.355
All I could think of was the part
I had to play.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.951
Then suddenly I went blank. I had
one line, and I couldn't remember it.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.275
When the reverend said,
"Who presents this woman?"...

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.154
was I supposed to say, "That's me,"
or was it, "l do"?

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.635
- ...Forever hold your peace--
- I couldn't think. I felt every eye...

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.036
in the place boring into the back
of my neck, waiting for me to screw up.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.276
- When suddenly, it was upon me.
- And so I now ask...

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.995
who presents this woman
in holy matrimony?

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.271
I do.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.429
Annie and Bryan, you have come here
today to join your hands--

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.233
- "Who presents this woman?"
- Always remember...

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.874
- This woman.
- this vow of marriage is most solemn...

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.276
- But she's not a woman.
She's just a kid.
- should not be entered into lightly.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:01.191
- And she's leaving us.
- With a deep realization of its
obligations and responsibilities.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.198
I realized at that moment that I was
never going to come home again...

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.754
and see Annie
at the top of the stairs.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.916
Never going to see her again
at our breakfast table...

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.713
in her nightgown and socks.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.718
I suddenly realized
what was happening.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.435
Annie was all grown up
and leaving us.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.711
And something inside
began to hurt.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.471
I, Bryan MacKenzie...

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.431
I, Bryan MacKenzie...

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.269
- take thee, Annie Banks...
- take thee, Annie Banks...

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.437
- to be my wedded wife.
- to be my wedded wife.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.233
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.272
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.030
- I, Annie Banks...
- I, Annie Banks...

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.879
take thee, Bryan MacKenzie...

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.754
- take thee, Bryan MacKenzie...
- to be my lawful wedded husband.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.075
to be my lawful wedded husband.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.475
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.478
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.239
The ring, please.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.514
With this ring as a token of my love
and affection, I thee wed.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:23.158
With this ring as a token of my love
and affection, I thee wed.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.189
Here, sweetie.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.998
With this ring as a token
of my love and affection...

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.190
I thee wed.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:43.154
With this ring as a token
of my love and affection, I thee wed.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:51.195
By virtue of the authority vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.834
You may kiss the bride.

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.315
Well, she did it.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.115
And now, as my son said,
it was time to party.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.198
- Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
Don't you look great?
- Congratulations.
- Wonderful party.

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.710
The house was busting at the seams.
Everywhere I looked, there were faces.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.593
Most of which, I might add,
I had never seen before.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.315
- George, I'd like you to meet the
Danish relatives. These are the Prowses.
- Hello!

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.399
I met Bryan's Danish relatives,
who thanked me profusely
for flying them over.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.596
- Hi. How are you?
- Everyone was telling me
what a great party it was.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.314
How beautiful the house looked.
They loved the flowers...

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.510
the hors d'oeuvres, the swans.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.473
We even seemed to be getting away
with only two parking attendants.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.751
Everything was running smoothly,
except for one small detail.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.791
- Annie's very favorite uncle.
This is Ben Banks.
- I still hadn't kissed the bride.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.195
- Congratulations.
- Where's Annie?
- Annie. She's having her picture taken.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.469
- Hi, Ben.
- How are you, George?

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.068
Yes. Ben's been
back in Connecticut.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.034
Okay, kids. Look at each other.
Very nice. Now, turn towards me, please.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.915
I'm sorry, sir. All traffic
has to go through the front door.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.713
Doris! It's so good to see you!
How are you?

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.479
- Oh, could I have one of those?
- Sorry. Just sold my last one.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.239
Hey, a button. It's navy.
This must be yours.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.910
We're moving into the tent now.
Dinner is served.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.270
This way to the tent, please.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.353
- Uh, let's--
I think we have to go back in--
- Ann-- Annie!

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.357
As well, l--

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:06.716
It was unbelievable.
I had never seen a line form so fast.

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.310
It was as if they knew
what the food was costing me.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.030
Finally,
I made it into the tent.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.236
I was ready to relax and taste
the food I'd been hearing about...

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.032
for the past five months, when--

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.233
Dad! Dad! There's some cops out front,
and they want to talk to you!

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.033
- Cops?
- I've heard. We'll handle dis togather.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.037
I got George. Ve're on our vay.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.230
Come on, George.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.672
One-Adam-seventy, roger.
Standby.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.189
Let me handle this, George.
Give me your wallet.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.117
Stop!

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:48.994
- Adam-30, disregard.
- What is this?

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:53.113
- See, Cameron? I told ya.
- Wow!

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.629
Just try to smile. That's all.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.876
- This your house?
- Me?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.549
Yeah, you. In the blue tux.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:06.515
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- Do you have a permit for parking
200 cars in this street?

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.839
Vell, the-- the problem is, Officer,

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.315
- Uh, but two got de flu.
- Well, you better get...

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.273
all these cars off this street
before the fire marshall gets here.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.436
Fine, fine. Any sugjoostions
what we do with them?

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.472
I don't care what you do with them.
Just have them off this street
within the next 30 minutes.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.876
Vill do, sir. Ve'll take care of it.
You're not to worry, okay?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.639
- Franck? Where are you? The cake--
- Uh, uh, George. They need me inside.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.320
Uh, the big moment.
The keck is being wheeled out!

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.149
- I-- I-- I'll handle this.
- I'm on my vay!

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.840
Where're we gonna get

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:48.799
Hey, baby, I'm your man
Turn around, you'll see

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.070
I may not stand tall
and I don't talk neat

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:54.112
But I'm gonna
win your love for me

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.829
Yes!

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:04.158
Watch out, baby, here comes your man
Lookin' cool to me

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.717
Whoa!

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.116
By the way,
great wedding, Mr Banks.

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.879
And don't worry!
I didn't eat anything!

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.676
- That makes two of us.
- I got sunshine

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.553
On a cloudy day

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.592
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.917
When it's cold outside

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.476
I've got the month of May

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:41.351
I guess you'll say

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:45.678
What can make me feel this way

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.315
- It's my girl
- My girl, my girl

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.238
I will feel aglow

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:57.593
Just thinkin' of you

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.315
And the way you look

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.556
Tonight

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:14.399
- I know.
- Oh, but you're lovely

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.479
With your smile so warm

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.832
And your cheeks so soft

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:26.191
There is nothing for me

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:30.029
But to love you

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.670
Just the way you look

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.836
Tonight

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.759
Just the way you look

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.752
- Tonight
- Well, I had to admit...

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.678
the wedding appeared to be
a complete success.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.712
Now, all I needed to make me happy
was a dance with the bride.

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:01.276
- It's time.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:05.916
in just a few moments,
Mrs Annie Banks-MacKenzie will be
tossing her bouquet in the foyer.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.235
- And then she's off to Hawaii.
- Let's go in there. Oh, sorry.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.432
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- This I was not going to miss.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.994
- Comin' through.
- The mob was headed
through the living room...

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.396
- so I decided to take a shortcut.
- Sorry.

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.272
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Great wedding, George!

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.675
- Had a lovely time.
- Thanks. Excuse me.
- Great party, George.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.995
Hurry up!

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.071
Whoa! Ay-yi-yi-yi!

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.716
Whoo!

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.395
- Where's my dad?
- I-- I-- I don't know.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:52.116
- I haven't seen him.
- Watch it. Behind you.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.196
Excuse me.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.150
- Should I throw it?
- Yeah! Yes!

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.832
He missed it.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.390
- Bye-bye!
- Let us through. Let us--

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.959
Bye!

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.036
Goodbye, Charlie!

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.037
Bye, Bryan!

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.479
- Bye!
- Bye!
- Thanks.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.239
- Bye!
- Have fun!

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.556
She was gone.
My Annie was gone...

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.797
and I was too late
to say goodbye.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.559
When the last guest was gone...

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.513
and the last glass of champagne
had been drunk...

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.870
we surveyed the damage.

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:18.278
It's funny how empty a house
can suddenly get, isn't it?

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:22.996
Yeah. I'm sorry you didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to her, George.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.112
Oh, that's all right.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.152
But, you know, I think she's going
to be really happy.

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:32.955
Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.599
- Hello?
- Dad!

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.393
Hi! Where are you?

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.317
At the airport.
Our plane's about to take off...

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.795
but I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.832
Thank Mom for everything, okay?

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.315
And Dad...

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.351
I love you.

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:04.631
I love you very much.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.637
I love you too, sweetheart.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.753
Thanks for calling.
And have a great honeymoon.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.998
Thanks. I will. Bye.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.030
Someday

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.517
When I'm awfully low

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.269
- When the world is cold
- That was Annie.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.472
- Oh.
- I will feel aglow

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.674
Just thinkin' of you

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.509
And the way you look

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.596
Tonight

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.471
Oh, but you're lovely

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.673
With your smile so warm

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.793
And your cheeks so soft

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.390
There is nothin' for me

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.230
But to love you

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.796
Just the way you look

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.550
Tonight
