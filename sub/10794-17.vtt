WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:05.406
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.439 --> 00:07.441
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.080
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.113 --> 00:13.814
Why wouldn't you
tell anyone?

00:13.847 --> 00:17.251
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.188
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.923
You are a good commander.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.359
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.560
RUSH: It was never about
 going home,

00:26.594 --> 00:28.829
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.232
That is the mission.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.202
They're machines.
 One simple directive,

00:34.235 --> 00:36.704
"Find alien technology
 and destroy it."

00:36.737 --> 00:38.772
I'm getting damage reports
 from all over the ship!

00:38.806 --> 00:40.941
Rush, whatever you're
 gonna do, you got to
 do it now!

00:40.974 --> 00:42.776
ELI: Recognition software,
 friend or foe.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.778
What if we tell them
 that they're the enemy?

00:44.812 --> 00:47.115
Ginn and I figured out

00:47.148 --> 00:50.418
how to dial the ninth chevron
 back to Earth while Destiny
 recharges in a star.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.953
RUSH'S VOICE: Tell them not
 to try and dial Earth.
 It won't work.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.688
If they go through with it,
 they're all going to die.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.056
Stop trying to scare people
 and get on with this.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.025
Wait three seconds,
then follow me!

00:58.058 --> 00:59.427
RUSH: The connection was made,

00:59.460 --> 01:01.662
but you were the only one
 who made it through to Earth.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.167
We're down to about
 20% efficiency here.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.339
That's about
all we're going to get.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.008
Moving on.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.450
Sir.
 T.J.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.785
Hey, I've had
 a number of people
 reporting headaches.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.254
Couple of cases
 of nausea and dizziness.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.388
I don't know if
 they're related,

01:27.421 --> 01:30.324
but both cases are sleeping
in fourth floor C quarters.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.825
Yeah, something
on this bucket
is always broken.

01:31.859 --> 01:35.196
Rush and Brody are working
 on it. We need more lime
 for the air filters.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.169
This is Young.
 What do we got?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.936
Two gates.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.339
One is locked out,
 the other looks promising.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.408
I'll send a team.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.143
WRAY: Whatever you
 decide to do, I...

01:49.177 --> 01:50.944
Hey.
 Hey.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.946
They just reported back.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.115
Looks like the planet
 may have some of
 the supplies we need.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.352
Oh! I don't suppose they found
 any of those purple fruit
 we got a while back?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.020
Yeah, yeah.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.455
You liked those?
 Those were awful.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.723
Yeah, they tasted terrible.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.293
So why do you ask?

02:08.229 --> 02:10.798
Why am I always
 the last one to know?
 What were they good for?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.032
(WRAY LAUGHS)

02:12.065 --> 02:13.201
CHLOE:
 Hey, did you see that?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.002
No, no, you can't just
change the subject.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.837
No, seriously, look!

02:19.072 --> 02:21.175
Something moved out there.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.044
There.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.516
What is it?

02:33.587 --> 02:34.488
Those are drones.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.430
We're under attack.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.715
Evasive maneuvers.
 SCOTT:
 Executing evasive maneuvers.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.887
Weapons active.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.097
Got one. Five.
 How many are left?

03:17.130 --> 03:18.432
There has to be
 a command ship
 in the vicinity.

03:18.466 --> 03:21.469
Which means a lot more
 could be on the way.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.281
Whoa. That can't be good.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.182
We're taking
 some minor damage.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.951
I'm rerouting power
to shields and weapons.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.927
Nice shot.
You're getting
pretty good at that.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.962
Bring it on.
 PARK: Let's hope they don't.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.898
Maybe we can handle
 six of them,

03:50.931 --> 03:53.834
but we can't jump back
 into FTL for another
 two hours and ten minutes.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.938
That's all of them.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.374
(BEEPING)
 SCOTT:
 Wait a minute, not exactly.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.311
The command ship just
 came up on sensors.
 It's on an intercept course.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.212
Put them in our six,
 give me maximum acceleration.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.079
Yes, sir.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.923
All right, command ship
is still gaining,
but just barely.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.293
Now, if we can keep this up
 until we're good to jump...

04:19.327 --> 04:22.162
We can't. Not a chance.
 We'd blow the engines.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.164
Buy as much time as you can.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.339
What the hell happened?

04:31.372 --> 04:33.240
I thought we left
 drone-occupied space
 behind a long time ago.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.508
Apparently, we were wrong.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.644
No, we weren't.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.079
You think they're tracking us
 somehow, coming after us?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.981
How?
 I'm not sure.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.650
You think it has something
 to do with the one
 we have onboard?

04:42.683 --> 04:44.485
I've considered that.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.654
I thought it might be
 worth the risk, you know,
 to study them.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.121
It's totally dormant.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.022
Get rid of it.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.026
Colonel Young,
 this is Park.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.962
Destiny just cut off power
 to the sub-light,

04:54.995 --> 04:56.296
probably to prevent
a burnout.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.131
Do you want me
 to override?

04:58.165 --> 05:00.033
I wouldn't recommend it.
 That's a negative.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.502
How about the command ship?

05:01.535 --> 05:03.504
They've slowed, as well,
 but still closing.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.272
ETA is less than one hour.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.341
YOUNG: Understood.
 How long till we jump?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.009
Yeah, we're cutting it close.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.611
We jumped early before.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.112
And the damage it caused
 is precisely the reason

05:12.145 --> 05:13.547
why we can't
 attempt that again now.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.483
I don't think we
can survive another
full-on attack.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.586
You'd better hope
 that we can.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.490
SCOTT: All right,
set her down.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.559
Okay, let's move.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.735
All right,
 sealed off the area
 by the docking collar.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.570
Okay, open the outer door.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.688
Destroying that drone
 only helps us if we
 make it to the next jump,

05:54.722 --> 05:57.124
assuming that's
how they tracked us
in the first place.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.593
Sorry.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.128
Just panicking out loud.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.106
What's our status?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.042
SCOTT: The command ship's
 just coming into range.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.117
(RAPID BEEPING)

06:24.151 --> 06:25.085
Okay.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.122
We're not going to make it.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.633
Sir...

06:49.510 --> 06:51.612
We're taking
a lot of damage, sir.
We can't hold them off.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.148
Now! We have to jump now!

06:55.182 --> 06:57.518
Not yet.
 Transferring all remaining
 power to the shields.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.425
Hold on!

07:12.500 --> 07:14.401
(RAPID BEEPING)

07:14.434 --> 07:17.104
Shut off those damn alarms!
 (BEEPING STOPS)

07:17.137 --> 07:19.139
How bad is it?
Well, we're still here.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.518
That was close.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.453
Yeah. How are
 the repairs going?
 Could be worse, I guess.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.188
We could use a few more
 of those robots.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.824
Shoot, you're lucky
 you have two.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.627
No, we're lucky
we're still alive.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.462
This ship can't possibly
 hold up against another
 attack like that.

07:42.496 --> 07:46.534
Well, hopefully they can't
 track us anymore.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.069
Don't you hate having
 to start that sentence
 with "hopefully"?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.708
We have a planet
 coming into range.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.277
It appears Destiny wants
 to drop out of FTL.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.245
Override it.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.650
We need lime
 for life support.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.152
This planet might
be a good candidate
to have it.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.555
Look, we can't stay
 in FTL forever.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.390
I'd much rather the ship be
 in a better state of repair.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.726
RUSH: Well, we've dealt with
 the most critical issues.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.863
Look, I can't guarantee
it's going to be safe,

08:15.896 --> 08:19.232
but I can guarantee
 if we don't stop pretty soon,

08:19.266 --> 08:20.868
we're going to have
trouble breathing.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.104
Okay. Drop out.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.510
Please tell me
 there's no more drones
 in range.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.881
Screens are clear.
 For now, anyway.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.157
What do we got?

08:44.191 --> 08:46.226
Good atmosphere.
 Temperature.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.596
Trees. Looks nice.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.430
Okay, let's go.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.541
This is Scott. We're gonna
 check out the immediate
 vicinity of the gate.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.577
Have Brody
 and his team standing by.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.945
Roger that.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.379
SCOTT: Secure the perimeter.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.551
(RIFLE COCKING)

09:11.585 --> 09:13.186
What is it?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.922
GREER: I think
 I heard something.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.299
Stop! Freeze! Halt!

09:28.435 --> 09:29.903
(EXCLAIMS)

09:29.937 --> 09:32.539
(PANTING) Don't shoot.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.407
You speak English.
 You came through the gate.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.777
Oh, my God, I know you.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.412
You're Matthew Scott.

09:41.782 --> 09:42.816
And you're Ronald Greer.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.186
How do you know our names?

09:51.458 --> 09:53.360
You're the Ancestors.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.405
They called them
 the Ancestors?
 Why would they say that?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.841
According to Scott,
they claim that
their civilization

10:07.875 --> 10:12.579
was founded 2,000 years ago
 by the crew of the Destiny.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.915
They said
 it was in their
 historical archives.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.817
They even had copies
 of old Kino footage,

10:16.850 --> 10:19.319
and that's how they
 were able to recognize
 Scott and Greer.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.788
How is it possible?

10:21.789 --> 10:22.555
The other Destiny.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.359
They dialed inside
 a star, right,

10:26.393 --> 10:29.830
and the whole ship went
 back in time what, 12 hours?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.532
When that happened,
 there was two of everyone,

10:32.565 --> 10:35.869
you, me, everyone.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.371
We thought that
 most of them died
 in the unstable wormhole

10:38.405 --> 10:41.541
trying to get back to Earth,
 but what if they didn't die?

10:41.574 --> 10:44.611
What if the wormhole
 sent them even further back?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.780
We know solar flares
 can do that,

10:46.814 --> 10:49.883
cause a wormhole
 to loop back on itself
 and move through time.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.686
Yeah, but it didn't
 loop back on itself.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.823
There was no Destiny
 here 2,000 years ago.

10:55.856 --> 10:59.492
The wormhole simply
 jumped to another gate
 in the vicinity.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.394
(LAUGHS)

11:01.428 --> 11:05.032
This is unbelievable.
 Those people are
 our descendants.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.534
Eli, we didn't
 go back in time.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.704
Well, no, not us,
 exactly, but the other us.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.605
Same DNA.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.709
Come on, am I
 the only person here

11:15.743 --> 11:18.011
who thinks this could be
 the coolest thing ever?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.716
Fine, don't you
at least want to know
what happened to them?

11:22.750 --> 11:25.719
How they survived
and developed as a society?

11:25.753 --> 11:27.721
You played a lot of SimCity
 as a kid, didn't you?

11:27.755 --> 11:29.689
Actually, this is
 more like SimEarth.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.292
Come on, we have to go
 talk to these people.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.531
There's still no sign
 of any drones?

11:38.565 --> 11:40.100
No, we should be safe
 enough here at the moment.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.935
See?
 RUSH: But, please,

11:41.969 --> 11:44.671
let's not lose sight
 of why we dropped out
 in the first place.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.639
Lime for the scrubbers,
 yeah, I know, I know.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.876
All right.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.889
Hey, everyone,
this is Jason and Ellie.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.829
Hello.
 You're Eli Wallace.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.463
Yeah.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.834
Chloe Armstrong,
 and Camile Wray.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.972
Pleased to meet you.
 I don't even know
 how this is possible.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.408
You're all dead,
 thousands of years ago.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.781
Yes and no.
 There's a perfectly
 good explanation.

12:27.815 --> 12:31.018
The Testament did say
 that the Destiny might
 someday return.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.656
The other me
 could have guessed
 we had gone back in time.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.559
You have to come
 and meet the others.
 The settlement's not far.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.994
Okay, sure, lead the way.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.830
I'll radio ahead and make sure
 they know we're coming.

12:42.863 --> 12:43.864
You have radios?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.733
Of course.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.501
ELLIE: No one's going
 to believe this.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.837
They're totally going
 to freak out when
 they see you.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.005
(ALL LAUGHING SOFTLY)

12:52.039 --> 12:52.940
This is so cool.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.477
ELLIE:
 When we first heard you
 come through the gate,

12:57.510 --> 12:59.112
we thought maybe
 you were from Novus.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.481
SCOTT: What's Novus?

13:01.514 --> 13:03.516
The planet where you
 founded our civilization
 2,000 years ago.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.852
CHLOE: You mean
 this isn't it?

13:04.885 --> 13:06.686
JASON: This place? No.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.755
Our people came here
 as part of an expedition,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.024
one of several sent
 to find other viable worlds.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.093
So you use gate travel?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.862
We did.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.762
But then one day
something happened,

13:15.795 --> 13:18.031
and we couldn't connect
to Novus anymore.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.200
There are no other
 gates in range.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.203
So you've been stranded here?
 How long ago did that happen?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.738
It was before Jason
and I were even born.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.877
It's just up
this way over here.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.012
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

13:45.658 --> 13:46.759
Hi.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.163
Hey, hey, it's okay.
 Don't be afraid.

13:56.769 --> 13:57.837
Hello.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.076
(ALL MURMURING)

14:13.220 --> 14:14.922
Incredible.

14:14.955 --> 14:15.923
This is Yaozu.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.626
That was my father's name.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.795
I'm Camile Wray.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.766
It is an honor to meet you.

14:26.799 --> 14:27.600
WRAY: Likewise.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.604
Come in, please.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.614
Thank you.

14:46.819 --> 14:50.223
YAOZU: May I introduce
 Landon, Abigale and Betty?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.093
Betty.
 Hello.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.794
YAOZU: Would you care
 for some tea?

14:54.827 --> 14:56.930
Yes. Yes, thank you.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.032
Will you sit?
 Sure. Why not?

14:59.066 --> 15:00.100
Sitting is good.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.113
Thank you.
 Thank you.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.115
You're even more
 handsome in person.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.921
Betty seems nice.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.794
Oh! That's good.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.731
Thank you.

15:31.764 --> 15:37.004
Most of us, myself included,
 never imagined this day
 would come.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.840
Ellie said the Testament
 spoke of Destiny's return.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.676
If that's some sort of
 written history, I'd love
 to take a look at it.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.746
If I could figure out...
 Eli, there's time.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.248
YAOZU:
 You have questions for us.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.250
We have questions for you,
 as well,

15:50.283 --> 15:53.820
but first, let me begin
 with some ancient words
 of greeting...

15:56.289 --> 15:58.691
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

15:58.725 --> 15:59.993
Which means...

16:00.893 --> 16:03.030
Roughly, um,

16:03.063 --> 16:07.700
"May all things go
according to the wishes
of those who hear it."

16:07.734 --> 16:08.801
That's right.

16:09.869 --> 16:10.670
(WRAY LAUGHS)

16:17.410 --> 16:19.846
There are about 100 people
 in this settlement,

16:19.879 --> 16:23.150
and a couple of others
 just like it scattered
 in the vicinity of the gate.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.052
That's not much
 of a civilization.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.687
But they claim that Novus,
 the planet they came from,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.057
has a population
 in the millions,

16:30.090 --> 16:34.361
and from the sounds of it,
 they were fairly advanced
 technologically.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.829
Obviously they had
a head start. I mean,
they had our knowledge.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.365
Did they know they
 had gone back in time?

16:38.398 --> 16:41.701
No, but apparently
 the other me suspected
 it was possible.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.637
I wrote that one day,
 Destiny could return.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.240
Still, they must have been
 pretty surprised to see you.

16:47.274 --> 16:51.344
How long have they
 been there?
 Thirty years.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.745
They were looking for
 other viable planets

16:52.779 --> 16:57.250
because their homeworld
was suffering some kind
of a natural disaster.

16:57.284 --> 17:00.019
It was volcanoes,
earthquakes
or something like that,

17:00.053 --> 17:02.089
but I don't know,
they said it was
getting pretty bad.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.691
WRAY: And there was
 a fair amount of
 political tension.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.194
Not surprising.
 No.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.829
But get this,

17:09.862 --> 17:12.832
there were two predominant
 countries on Novus,

17:12.865 --> 17:16.002
each based on
 a distinct political
 philosophy.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.406
The people in the
 expedition were all from
 one country called Tenera.

17:19.439 --> 17:23.175
They follow the teachings
 of this book, the Testament,

17:23.210 --> 17:26.179
which apparently
 some of us wrote.

17:26.213 --> 17:30.417
Wait, "Tenera"?
 That's Ancient. That means
 "the land of the young."

17:30.450 --> 17:33.052
Or "the land of Young."

17:33.086 --> 17:35.155
There was also another
 group of evacuees

17:36.989 --> 17:41.228
who blamed the other me
 for what happened.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.131
They thought Rush was
 still onboard Destiny

17:44.164 --> 17:46.966
and would one day
 come and rescue them.

17:46.999 --> 17:50.036
Eventually, he became
 some kind of savior figure.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.471
They broke off
 and formed a country
 of their own.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.473
Let me guess, "Rusha"?
 (VOLKER AND PARK CHUCKLE)

17:53.506 --> 17:55.007
That's funny.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.311
They called it Futura.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.046
Really?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.148
BRODY: What wrong with Futura?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.382
It's a dumb name.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.816
Yeah, how is it dumb?

18:03.850 --> 18:07.254
Apparently,
he came up with it.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.161
WRAY: These people we met
 believe that the stargate
 on Novus

18:14.194 --> 18:18.231
was either damaged
 or destroyed in
 a subsequent earthquake.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.867
Right, so they have
 no idea what happened
 on their homeworld?

18:21.268 --> 18:22.034
No.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.072
ELI: And check this out.
 It's a databank,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.308
compatible with
 Destiny's technology.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.843
It has copies
 of Kino video clips

18:30.877 --> 18:34.013
the evacuees made
 their first few years
 on the planet.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.182
It's us.

18:35.215 --> 18:35.948
It's the other us.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.919
Apparently, to the people
 of Novus,

18:39.952 --> 18:44.157
the original Kino
 is a holy artifact,
 like the Dead Sea Scrolls.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.760
Look, are we going to get
 the supplies we need or not?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.029
Yeah, they're helping us
 gather all kinds of stuff.

18:50.062 --> 18:53.500
Good, then perhaps something
 useful will come out of this
 after all.

18:54.167 --> 18:54.967
(SIGHS)

18:58.137 --> 19:00.940
I can't believe you helped
 found an entire country

19:00.973 --> 19:03.443
based on the hopes that
 he would come and rescue you.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.478
I can't believe
 you named it Futura.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.779
Shut up.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.381
Seriously, isn't that a font?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.821
SCOTT: All right,
 this right here.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.124
Medicinal, food, food.
 Okay, thank you very much.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.227
This also goes
to Becker, all right?

19:20.260 --> 19:23.530
There's a station set up
 in the Gate Room.
 Okay? Make it happen.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.405
Cold. Hydroponics.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.277
Just place it
 right over there.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.047
WRAY: This is our bridge.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.151
(LAUGHING) This is awesome!

19:45.184 --> 19:46.553
He said "awesome."

19:46.586 --> 19:48.921
WRAY: I'd like you
 to meet Dr. Rush.
 Hello.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.958
I was just leaving, actually.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.398
Well, you can stay
 as long as you like.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.933
I'm sure Doctors Volker
 and Park

20:00.967 --> 20:02.802
have many amusing stories
 to fascinate you with.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.607
Is everything all right?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.943
There are those somewhat
 less enlightened among
 our people

20:10.977 --> 20:12.545
who believe he is a demon

20:12.579 --> 20:14.947
who rips souls
 from human bodies

20:14.981 --> 20:17.984
and takes them to hell
 where they suffer
 for all eternity.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.256
It's funny how things
 have a way

20:23.290 --> 20:25.892
of getting twisted
 and exaggerated over time.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.394
While others don't.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.263
He's not that bad.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.964
Many Futurans worship him
 like a god.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.835
We won't tell him that.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.478
I thought you said
 it was compatible.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.079
Nothing ever works
 the way it's supposed to.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.449
Oh!

20:50.116 --> 20:51.918
There.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.621
This is the spot where we're
 going to break ground.

20:54.654 --> 21:00.126
Hard to imagine now,
 but one day, hopefully,
 this will all be one big city.

21:01.628 --> 21:05.398
And we took a final vote
 last night to name the planet.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.301
I suggested it should be
 something in Ancient.

21:08.335 --> 21:12.339
Volker said Novus Mundus,
 which means "New World."

21:12.372 --> 21:16.409
While appropriate,
 nobody really liked
 the sound of "Mundus,"

21:16.443 --> 21:18.411
except Volker.
 (LAUGHS)

21:18.445 --> 21:21.681
Anyway, Novus ended up
 winning out,

21:21.714 --> 21:25.385
which, it's kind of strange,
 because it just...
 It means "new."

21:26.553 --> 21:28.388
Like, new what?

21:31.624 --> 21:35.161
Well, new everything,
 I guess, so Novus it is.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.335
And here we are back
 at the Gate Room.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.038
JASON: This ship
 is incredible.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.640
It has its flaws.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.642
Thank you for
 showing us around.
 You're welcome.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.345
And thank you
 for your people's help
 gathering supplies.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.514
They will serve us well
 for some time.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.283
You've been so kind
 and patient answering
 all our questions.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.651
My pleasure.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.720
We only have one more thing
to ask of you.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.555
Of course. What is it?

22:02.589 --> 22:05.625
Will you take us home?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.560
JASON:
 We haven't been able
 to dial the gate,

22:07.594 --> 22:09.128
but that doesn't mean that
 all of Novus is destroyed.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.163
Just that the gate
 isn't working.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.164
This ship could
 take us there.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.301
All of you?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.638
We were supposed to build
 a colony, but only with
 the help of our homeworld,

22:18.671 --> 22:22.008
and an open gateway providing
 ongoing support and supplies.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.242
I understand that, but...

22:23.275 --> 22:26.546
We're surviving,
 but just barely.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.381
YAOZU: We have struggled
 through great hardship.

22:28.415 --> 22:31.317
It's hard to imagine
the beliefs of the Futurans

22:31.350 --> 22:33.720
could be so close
 to the truth,

22:33.753 --> 22:36.088
but here you are,
 all of you,

22:37.590 --> 22:39.459
come to rescue us.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.063
Shouldn't we try
 and help them?

22:44.096 --> 22:47.199
Forget the relationship,
 they're human beings.

22:47.233 --> 22:50.570
Imagine if the situation
 were reversed, and it was us
 asking them for help.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.005
And we did,

22:53.039 --> 22:55.675
and despite the fact that
 they barely have enough
 to survive on their own,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.678
they've helped us gather
 everything we need and more.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.213
Yeah, because
 they thought we were
 their way off that planet.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.516
Well, correct me
 if I am wrong,

23:03.550 --> 23:06.018
but we can't take
 that many people onboard
 even if we want to.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.287
Based on the address,
 I figured out where Novus is.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.589
It would only take us
 a week to get there,

23:09.622 --> 23:12.459
and, yes, yes,
 I've done the math.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.761
With the lime we got
 from the planet,

23:14.794 --> 23:18.197
we should be able to make it
 just before the atmosphere
 on the ship gets toxic.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.799
RUSH: Yeah, with
nothing in reserve.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.268
So what happens
 if we get there and we
 don't find any more?

23:23.436 --> 23:25.304
We're stuck,

23:25.337 --> 23:27.574
and that's not to mention
 the drain on our food
 and water supplies.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.308
These people
 were advanced
 30 years ago.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.143
They could be even more
advanced now.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.245
Hell, maybe they could even
 help us restore the ship

23:33.279 --> 23:35.081
to its full working capacity.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.316
Or they could have died
 in subsequent earthquakes.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.252
I mean, do they even know
 what was causing the problem
 in the first place?

23:40.286 --> 23:41.621
According to Yaozu,

23:41.654 --> 23:43.422
their scientists
 were beginning
 to form a theory

23:43.456 --> 23:46.258
before the expedition
 was launched.

23:46.292 --> 23:48.094
They had evidence to suggest

23:48.127 --> 23:52.331
that a rogue black hole
 was approaching
 their solar system.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.066
Well, I take it
 that's not good.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.804
The resulting tidal forces
could tear the whole system
apart.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.272
So we could use
 all our supplies
 to get them there,

24:00.306 --> 24:02.575
and then find no planet?

24:02.609 --> 24:04.276
It might not have
 happened yet.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.578
It could take
 hundreds of years.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.614
Please, let's not forget,

24:07.647 --> 24:10.182
we still don't know
 how those drones tracked us.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.185
Now, until we figure
that out,

24:13.219 --> 24:17.524
our best form of defense
 is to spend as little time
 out of FTL as possible.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.560
The last thing we need
 right now is an unnecessary
 drain on our resources.

24:22.529 --> 24:25.532
The planet's in our path,
 so we check it out.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.534
If they are still alive,
 maybe we can help them
 fix the gate,

24:27.567 --> 24:28.735
and they can rescue
their own people.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.304
Is that your final decision?

24:32.338 --> 24:33.405
Let's finish loading
 the supplies.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.114
(SCREAMS)

24:42.148 --> 24:43.282
Eli, get that thing
 out of my face!
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.084
(OLD JOHANSEN GROANING)

24:47.419 --> 24:48.721
Yeah, it's time.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.660
On the next contraction,
 I want you to push, okay?

24:53.693 --> 24:54.894
OLD JOHANSEN: Okay.
 OLD WRAY: All right.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.896
(OLD JOHANSEN SCREAMING)

24:56.929 --> 24:58.731
Keep pushing!

24:58.765 --> 25:03.202
Keep pushing! Keep pushing!
 I'm pushing! Where is he?

25:03.235 --> 25:05.471
Matt said they were
 scouting a place
 for an irrigation canal.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.173
OLD JOHANSEN:
 That was hours ago!

25:07.206 --> 25:09.576
OLD WRAY: Yeah. He's gonna
 be here, all right?
 Just stay focused.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.410
OLD JOHANSEN:
 (PANTING) Okay.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.546
OLD WRAY:
 Deep breath and then push.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.814
Now!

25:14.847 --> 25:16.849
(OLD JOHANSEN SCREAMING)

25:18.585 --> 25:20.553
Hey.
 Hi.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.222
I didn't want you to miss it.
 LD YOUNG: No, I'm here.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.357
It's gonna be all right.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.026
OLD WRAY:
 I can feel the baby's head.

25:27.059 --> 25:31.263
Okay, on the next contraction,
 I want you to give
 one big push, okay?

25:31.297 --> 25:32.331
Okay.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.465
(PANTING)

25:34.634 --> 25:36.435
(SCREAMING)

25:40.539 --> 25:41.307
It's a boy!

25:43.643 --> 25:44.611
A boy!

25:50.216 --> 25:51.851
First baby is born on Novus.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.552
(OLD ELI LAUGHING)

25:56.656 --> 25:57.957
He's beautiful!

25:57.990 --> 25:59.558
(BABY CRYING)

26:19.478 --> 26:21.948
We have been here
 10 years now.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.852
Our little town's
 coming along.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.555
Some of us even
 have children.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.323
It's been a struggle
 at times,

26:34.293 --> 26:37.630
but it's been kind of fun
 to try to find ways
 to make this work.

26:40.867 --> 26:45.838
I just wish my mother
 could see what I've done,
 meet her grandson.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.445
That's my only
 real regret in all this.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.287
OLD YOUNG: I remember
 when we first came here.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.691
It was, well, it feels like
 a long time ago now. It was...

27:04.724 --> 27:07.694
We had very little,
 it was really hard,

27:07.727 --> 27:10.697
but I think it
 brought us together.

27:10.730 --> 27:14.767
Everything we have here,
 we have built
 with our own hands,

27:14.801 --> 27:19.005
and now we stand
 at a precipice.

27:19.038 --> 27:24.944
Some of us want to divide,
 and sure, yes,
 we have our issues,

27:24.977 --> 27:28.614
and we have our differences,
 but we can't lose perspective.

27:28.647 --> 27:33.485
As your leader,
 I may not have been perfect,
 I know that.

27:33.519 --> 27:37.556
But I know that
 I tried my best,
 and that I persevered.

27:37.589 --> 27:42.895
Now, as a group,
 we will survive.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.797
We will prosper
 as long as we can remember

27:44.831 --> 27:49.702
above anything else
 that we need each other,

27:49.736 --> 27:51.938
and we need to help
 each other.

27:59.445 --> 28:03.549
That doesn't change
 anything here and now.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.952
I just thought
 it might sway your decision

28:06.786 --> 28:09.688
seeing that they are us.

28:09.722 --> 28:14.727
As much as we'd like
 to ignore their problems,
 we're all human beings.

28:14.761 --> 28:17.429
We have a responsibility
 to each other, don't we?

28:17.463 --> 28:19.698
Well, unfortunately,
 what we should do
 and what we can do

28:19.732 --> 28:21.901
are too far apart.

28:21.934 --> 28:25.071
We'll stop by
 their home planet,
 and we'll see what happened.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.442
I'd like to say goodbye.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.077
Sure.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.953
It's not a question
 of not wanting to help.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.455
It's a question of resources.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.492
There are so many of you,
 and the ship's damaged,

28:47.459 --> 28:49.628
and I'm so sorry.

28:49.661 --> 28:52.464
So, it seems the Futurans
 were wrong after all.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.967
I only wish we'd known sooner.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.804
We could have avoided
 generations of conflict.

28:57.837 --> 29:01.040
We may be able
 to get the Novus gate
 up and running again.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.776
If we can,
we'll dial in
and let you know.

29:07.679 --> 29:08.848
We'll be waiting.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.450
(EXPLOSION)

29:14.420 --> 29:16.488
WRAY: What was that?
SCOTT: Eli?

29:16.522 --> 29:17.656
I don't know.

29:17.689 --> 29:18.657
Over there.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.664
WRAY: Oh, my God.
 JASON: What?

29:25.697 --> 29:28.367
What was that?
We need to get the hell
out of here now!

29:30.536 --> 29:33.472
Do you have a safe place
 to hide, a cave?
 Not nearby.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.773
We have to get to the gate!

29:34.807 --> 29:36.475
We need to evacuate
 your people right now.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.811
I don't understand...
 GREER: Incoming!

29:38.845 --> 29:40.947
SCOTT: Go, go, go, go! Run!

29:40.980 --> 29:43.515
WRAY: Go to the gate!
 Go to the gate!
 SCOTT: Go, go, go! Hurry!

29:43.549 --> 29:45.451
Come on, go, go, go!

29:45.484 --> 29:47.486
WRAY: Jason, take everyone
 to the gate now!

30:02.234 --> 30:04.770
Report.
 A command ship
 just dropped out.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.939
Can we jump?
 VOLKER: Yeah, we're good.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.707
Brody, this is Young.
 Dial the planet.

30:08.740 --> 30:11.110
Get Scott's team back here
 immediately.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.980
They just dialed in.
 Drones are attacking
 the planet, as well.

30:14.013 --> 30:17.083
Scott is requesting
 permission to evacuate
 the locals to Destiny.

30:20.719 --> 30:22.922
Tell him to go ahead.
 We'll hold them off
 as long as we can.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.526
Come on, come on,
 come on! Go, go, go!

30:27.559 --> 30:29.028
Come on!

30:29.061 --> 30:30.662
Go, go, go!

30:30.696 --> 30:32.231
We got this!
No way!

30:32.264 --> 30:34.000
Not until these people
 are safe!

30:36.535 --> 30:38.637
Come on, right up there.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.173
Okay, guys,
 keep coming through!

30:41.207 --> 30:42.441
Keep coming,
don't bunch up!

30:44.710 --> 30:47.880
How the hell
 did they find us?
I don't know.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.515
To the left, to the left!
 Come on!

30:49.548 --> 30:51.050
Get down! Get down!

31:05.064 --> 31:07.967
(DRONES WHINING PAST)

31:13.639 --> 31:15.107
(WHINING RECEDING)

31:22.214 --> 31:23.615
We can't take
 much more of this.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.851
BRODY: Colonel, we've lost
 the connection to the planet.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.619
Scott and his team
 still haven't come through.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.221
Well, try to dial them.
 Find out what happened.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.623
We've tried already!
 The address won't connect.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.993
The gate is now saying
 it's no longer operational.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.999
Okay, that's it.
 We have to go.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.769
Make the jump.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.004
Colonel!
Do it!

32:03.855 --> 32:07.826
I hate to be the one
 to say this, but we're
 stranded here.

32:07.859 --> 32:10.262
Well, even if we
 can't use the gate,

32:10.296 --> 32:12.264
Destin can still
 come back for us.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.168
What?
 SCOTT: They were under
 attack, as well,

32:16.202 --> 32:18.804
and the ship was
 already damaged.

32:18.837 --> 32:21.173
Even if they got away,
 they wouldn't be able
 to risk it.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.808
But the drones are gone.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.643
ELI: But they don't
 know that.

32:24.676 --> 32:25.944
And without the gate,
 we have no way to tell them.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.914
What were those things?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.682
SCOTT: Robot ships.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.184
There's no pilots.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.620
ELI: A mechanical army
 of drones

32:34.653 --> 32:38.024
programmed to seek out
 and destroy all technology
 foreign to them.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.292
They took out our generators
 and long-range transmitter.

32:40.326 --> 32:44.696
And they were built
to win a war between two
alien races in this galaxy.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.666
When the war was over,
 the weapons were left behind.

32:47.699 --> 32:48.967
Why would they come here?

32:51.870 --> 32:53.639
That might be our fault.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.308
WRAY: We encountered them
 a little while ago.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.677
It seems they've been
 tracking us ever since.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.980
We thought we'd lost them,
 but apparently not.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.682
They're chasing Destiny.

33:03.715 --> 33:07.019
It still doesn't explain
 how they found us here.

33:10.722 --> 33:11.590
The gate.

33:13.325 --> 33:17.063
An active gate
 is a massive subspace event.

33:17.096 --> 33:20.866
They must have found
 a way to detect it
 from long range.

33:20.899 --> 33:23.902
You said that there were
 more settlements nearby.

33:23.935 --> 33:26.272
Do they have generators
 and other technology, as well?

33:29.341 --> 33:30.242
We have to warn them.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.714
It's probably too late.

33:38.217 --> 33:41.253
It has to be the active gate.
 Every time we drop out,
 we dial.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.755
We've been broadcasting
 our position through subspace.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.191
It's the only thing
that would explain

33:45.224 --> 33:47.259
why they attacked the planet
 and Destiny at the same time.

33:47.293 --> 33:50.096
So we are safe as long
 as we don't dial.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.664
But the gate is
 our supply line.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.101
Well, we can use a shuttle
 in the meantime, as necessary.

33:55.134 --> 33:59.338
The drones' ability
 to detect an active gate
 must have some limitation.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.240
Well, I'll have to
 do the calculations,
 but I agree.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.642
We should be able to use
 the gates again at some point.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.979
Okay, what about
the team on the planet?

34:09.947 --> 34:12.083
Well, we don't even know
 if they're still alive.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.819
Don't we have
 to take that chance?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.257
And risk the ship
 and everyone onboard?

34:23.929 --> 34:24.929
He's right.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.991
Listen, I'm sorry.
 We're not going back.

35:07.038 --> 35:10.342
Camile said you were out here.
 What are you doing?

35:10.376 --> 35:12.444
I had an idea,
 wanted to check
 something out.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.347
I'm assuming this thing's
 never going to dial again.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.183
No.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.850
So, what's your plan?

35:18.884 --> 35:21.520
Gates use short range
 subspace transmitters.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.756
It's how they communicate
 status updates with Destiny

35:24.790 --> 35:26.292
before it even drops
 out or dials,

35:26.325 --> 35:29.361
and I was thinking
 maybe we can use it
 to send a message.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.863
Tell them the drones are gone,
 it's safe to pick us up.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.999
And won't the signal
 call the drones back?

35:35.234 --> 35:36.168
I would like to say no.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.372
The signal is
 several thousand times fainter

35:40.406 --> 35:43.108
than the event
 caused by an active wormhole.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.843
But you can't know for sure.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.479
It's a calculated risk.

35:47.513 --> 35:50.182
But if the signal's
that faint, will it
 even reach Destiny?

35:50.216 --> 35:51.783
They've probably
 already jumped
 into FTL by now.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.553
No, it should reach them
 if they haven't gone too far.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.888
So this is
 a total crapshoot.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.224
It...

35:58.257 --> 35:59.090
Pretty much.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.562
So far, I haven't
 even figured out
 how to send a message.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.097
All I can do is turn
 this stupid thing off and on.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.339
BRODY: "Mundus"?
 VOLKER: Yeah.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.841
Ancient for "world."
 Novus Mundus. "New World."

36:15.874 --> 36:17.075
It sounds stupid.

36:17.108 --> 36:19.245
(LAUGHS) Yeah,
and "Futura" sounds cool?

36:19.278 --> 36:21.179
Yeah, obviously,
 it's a matter of opinion.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.548
It's a font.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.083
What do we got?

36:25.116 --> 36:27.152
Not sure. Have a look.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.922
It just started blinking
 like that. I'm not sure
 what it means.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.999
I do.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.370
This is Young. Rush, Chloe,
 I need you on the bridge now.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.973
It's Morse code.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.149
Morning.
 Morning.

37:00.319 --> 37:04.890
I'm starting to get the
feeling that we may have
to settle in here for good.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.559
One more shot.
 SCOTT: Eli! Hey!

37:07.593 --> 37:10.529
Hey, you did it.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.464
I did it?
 Yeah, it worked.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.131
ELI: How do you know?

37:14.400 --> 37:16.167
(SHIP APPROACHING OVERHEAD)

37:22.274 --> 37:23.074
WRAY: (LAUGHING) Yes!

37:27.513 --> 37:28.847
You did it!

37:30.982 --> 37:33.118
Colonel Young said
we're going to take
these people home.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.171
Sorry. Hey.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.039
Thanks.

37:56.207 --> 37:59.044
I know I said I wanted
to help these people,
but I got to be honest.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.013
I'm glad we're
 almost there.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.682
I think it's been
 kind of fun.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.951
Don't tell that to Rush.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.086
He's been even
 grumpier than usual.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.488
He says the CO2
they're producing

38:09.521 --> 38:12.691
has completely
offset the extra lime
we brought onboard.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.293
When they leave,
 we'll just be right back
 to where we started.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.363
Some of them are saying
they'd like to stay.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.965
I know.
You think Colonel Young
will let them?

38:19.998 --> 38:21.367
Guess it depends
on how many.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.168
Well, do you think
 their planet's

38:23.201 --> 38:24.503
going to be in one piece
 when we get there?

38:24.536 --> 38:26.538
ELI: Absolutely.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.940
The way they described
 the seismic activity,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.709
I'd say they got years
 before it goes critical.

38:30.742 --> 38:33.178
SCOTT: I don't know.

38:33.211 --> 38:35.113
It was bad enough to make them
 send out those expeditions
 in the first place,

38:35.146 --> 38:37.215
and that was 30 years ago.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.217
And what about the politics?

38:39.250 --> 38:40.652
I overheard
 some of them talking,

38:40.686 --> 38:43.188
and it sounds like things
 were getting pretty bad.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.391
Apparently, both sides
 had nuclear weapons.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.394
No, no, there's no way
 it would have come to that.

38:48.427 --> 38:51.397
But they were facing
 an escalating
 natural disaster,

38:51.430 --> 38:53.064
putting pressure
 on their resources...

38:53.098 --> 38:55.166
Which just as easily
 could have brought
 them together.

38:56.402 --> 39:00.406
Guys, they're
our descendants.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.642
We passed down all
of our knowledge,
our understanding.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.011
And apparently,
 some of our disagreements.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.214
YOUNG: Lieutenant.
 Sir.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.550
We're about to drop out.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.052
As soon as we're in range,
 you're going to be flying
 the first recon.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.054
Yes, sir.
 I'll go prep the shuttle.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.089
If it's okay...
 Permission granted.

39:18.624 --> 39:19.625
Thank you.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.071
We'll be passing into
 the atmosphere shortly.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.511
No radio signals.

39:39.545 --> 39:43.181
Yeah. I noticed that.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.315
They're supposed to be
 advanced, right?

39:55.160 --> 39:58.296
So?
 They're entering
 the atmosphere.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.698
SCOTT: We're passing through
 what appears to be

39:59.731 --> 40:02.233
a pretty thick layer
 of particulate matter.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.401
Dust and ash.

40:07.473 --> 40:10.408
All right, getting a reading
 on surface temperatures.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.483
It's pretty cold down there.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.517
Oh, God.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.319
A nuclear winter.

40:21.352 --> 40:22.754
SCOTT: All right,
 cloud's breaking up.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.523
We should be able to see
 something here pretty soon.

40:25.356 --> 40:26.191
Whoa!

40:29.495 --> 40:30.295
What is it?

40:32.163 --> 40:33.364
SCOTT: It's a city.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.604
It's a huge, modern city,
 and it's completely intact.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.108
It's incredible.

40:50.381 --> 40:53.184
I'm not picking up
 any radioactivity.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.554
In fact, we're not getting
 any EM at all.

40:56.822 --> 41:00.125
RUSH: Of course.
 What?

41:00.158 --> 41:02.594
Well, the layer
 of dust and ash,
 blocking out sunlight,

41:02.628 --> 41:05.463
lowering surface temperatures.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.766
There's really only
 one possible explanation.

41:07.799 --> 41:11.837
Extreme volcanic activity.
 Like a super-volcano,
 or worse.

41:11.870 --> 41:15.707
Not exactly nuclear winter,
 but just as devastating.

41:19.410 --> 41:20.579
Are you seeing any movement
 down there?

41:23.148 --> 41:24.149
Negative.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.723
I'm gonna bring us in
 for a closer look.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.829
Sir, we've done another
 close pass over the city

41:37.863 --> 41:39.264
including the outskirts.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.534
We're not seeing
 any signs of people.

41:42.568 --> 41:45.737
No smoke from fires,
 no tracks in the snow,
 nothing.

41:49.541 --> 41:50.909
It doesn't look like
 anyone's been around here

41:50.942 --> 41:52.744
for a long time.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.115
But millions of people
 lived here.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.687
Where did they all go?

43:27.372 --> 43:27.873
English - US - Line 21
