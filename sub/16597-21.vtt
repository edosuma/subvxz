00:08.660 --> 00:12.360
Great news.
I just got us tickets
to The Bodyguard.

00:12.403 --> 00:16.103
Mom, I know you're a little
pop-culture challenged,

00:16.146 --> 00:18.105
but that's not in theaters
anymore.

00:20.237 --> 00:23.762
No, not the movie,
the musical.
At the Pantages.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.634
That's nice of you,
but why?

00:27.592 --> 00:30.073
We don't do enough things
together as a family.

00:30.117 --> 00:33.250
I begged you to let me
choreograph something
for all of us.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.860
Look, I thought
seeing The Bodyguard

00:34.904 --> 00:36.384
would be a fun thing
to do together,

00:36.427 --> 00:37.689
just the four of us.Good call.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.604
I love The Bodyguard.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.085
Just the five of us.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.836
Will everyone
please stop yelling?
I mean...

00:53.879 --> 00:55.229
I'm sorry.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.318
My open mic
went pretty late last night,

00:57.361 --> 00:58.667

much sleep.

Getting back in the comedy
game, huh, Dad?

01:04.151 --> 01:07.197
Yeah, well, I mean,
don't call it a comeback.
I've been here for years.

01:10.679 --> 01:13.421
Wait.
Aren't Clark and Connor
having a thing tomorrow?

01:13.464 --> 01:16.772
Yeah, but it's casual.
I'm sure we can miss it.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.861
It's definitely not something
we need to drag the kids to.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.863
Oh, please.
Clark and Connor
would understand.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.647
It's The Bodyguard.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.874
Hey, everybody, listen.
Quick reminder,

01:31.917 --> 01:33.136
our barbecue
is this weekend,

01:33.180 --> 01:34.616
so Connor and I
need to get a head count.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.835
No big deal,
should be super chill.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.228
You know what, Clark,
we're not gonna make it.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.490
Pat's taking me
out of town.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.970
No! No, you can't.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.319
Ah, sorry to miss it,

01:42.363 --> 01:45.017
but the lovely isle
of Santa Catalina calls.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.759
Can't you go
another weekend?

01:47.803 --> 01:49.109
Afraid not.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.546
No, this is mating season
for their world-famous bison.

01:51.589 --> 01:55.071
And the hotel's room deposit
is non-refundable,

01:55.115 --> 01:57.160
and I'm almost
comedically cheap.

please, please,

02:00.337 --> 02:01.773

are gonna be there.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.514
Um, quick question,

02:03.558 --> 02:05.777
will this be
a vegan barbecue?

02:05.821 --> 02:08.345
Obviously. Violence begins
with the fork. Why?

02:10.260 --> 02:11.392
No reason.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.917

have plans.

The Bodyguard

Can't you go see that
some other weekend?

We already bought tickets,

02:22.620 --> 02:24.709

are going, so...

02:24.753 --> 02:26.537
Well, our barbecue
is family-friendly,

02:26.581 --> 02:28.844
so D.K. and the kids
are more than welcome.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.237
I guess I can see
if there's some way

02:30.280 --> 02:31.760
to dump off the tickets,
but I...

02:31.803 --> 02:33.240
Great, you're in.
This is a verbal contract.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.458
I will see you tomorrow.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.156
I said I would try.Fine!

02:43.206 --> 02:45.600

as you are,

are going to Catalina.

Yes, Connor,
they know about the bison.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.086

it's our surprise wedding.

it was so lovely

you won't be getting
any gifts, right?

for a gift now that I know?No.
