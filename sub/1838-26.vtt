THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS TALK TO ME.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.700
SAY, "HI, DAD."

00:25.700 --> 00:26.667
HI, DAD.

"YES, HE DID,"

00:39.200 --> 00:40.400
AND I WAS, LIKE,
"NO, HE DIDN'T."

00:40.400 --> 00:42.300

03:30.867 --> 03:32.800
EDDIE, I DON'T KNOW WHERE

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
YOU ALWAYS END UP
SHOPPING WITH US GIRLS

03:34.800 --> 03:35.900
AND YOU NEVER COMPLAIN.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.100
YEAH, WELL, IT'S
A SACRIFICE I MAKE
FOR MY FRIENDS.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.300
EXCUSE ME.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.967
YES, THAT IS
DEFINITELY YOUR COLOR.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.667
COME ON, RAE,

04:13.834 --> 04:16.300
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BAD AT MATH!

04:16.300 --> 04:19.734
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS NOT MATH, OK?

04:19.734 --> 04:21.600

05:22.467 --> 05:26.800
KEEP IN MIND

06:25.934 --> 06:28.600
ALL MY FRIENDS
GO SHOPPING

06:28.600 --> 06:29.867
NAME ONE.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.000
PETE WHO?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.500
PETE SALADBOWL.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
HOW COME I NEVER MET
PETE SALADBOWL?

06:38.000 --> 06:42.467
BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS

06:43.033 --> 06:43.734
RAE, DID YOU GET IT?

06:43.734 --> 06:47.033

06:53.734 --> 06:57.000
SEE? YOU SEE THAT?
YOU ALWAYS LET RAVEN
GO SHOPPING BY HERSELF.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.133
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S DIFFERENT.
SHE'S OLDER AND MORE
RESPONSIBLE.

07:00.133 --> 07:02.500
LOOK AT HER RUSHING
UP THERE TO DO HER HOMEWORK.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.834
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU,

GET OUT OF THE SHIRT!

08:09.400 --> 08:10.500
GET OUT!

08:10.500 --> 08:12.667
NO!

08:12.667 --> 08:16.033
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
ON THE WAY TO THE PARTY?

08:16.033 --> 08:16.500
WHAT?

08:16.500 --> 08:19.200
EDDIE! I CAN'T
GO TO THE PARTY
LIKE THIS.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.400
I HAVE TO GET
THIS STAIN OUT!

08:22.400 --> 08:23.233
OH, UH, RAE,

08:23.233 --> 08:26.200
DON'T WORRY.
THAT STAIN'LL NEVER
COME OUT.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.500
CHELS, IT HAS TO
COME OUT.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.400
'CAUSE I HAVE TO
RETURN IT TOMORROW

08:30.400 --> 08:34.233
SO I CAN GET
MY MONEY BACK
TO BUY THE CALCULATOR!

08:34.233 --> 08:37.500
YA HAD TO GET IT.
WELL, NOW YOU GOT IT.

08:44.367 --> 08:48.934
HOW AM I GONNA

BIG STAIN ON IT?

08:48.934 --> 08:50.600
TOSS IT AND RUN.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.600
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.700
TOSS IT,
GRAB THE MONEY,
AND RUN.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT,

08:57.600 --> 09:00.100
SO I'M GONNA STAY HERE
AND TRY TO GET
THIS STAIN OUT.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.600
YOU GUYS CAN GO
TO THE PARTY WITHOUT ME.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.200
OK, BYE!
BYE!

09:03.200 --> 09:05.800
HEY, Y'ALL AIN'T

09:05.800 --> 09:08.500
I KNEW IT WAS

09:08.500 --> 09:09.900
IS IT COMING OUT?

09:09.900 --> 09:11.467
YEAH!
GREAT.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.300
SHE MEANS THE STAIN.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.400
OH...
NO.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.700
THIS STUFF SPRAYS OUT
REALLY WELL.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.100
IT MUST BE
THE EZ-FLOW NOZZLE.

09:20.100 --> 09:20.600
GIVE ME THAT!

09:20.600 --> 09:24.600
IT ACTUALLY
LOOKS LIKE THE STAIN'S
GETTING BIGGER TO ME.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.700
OH, IT DOES!

09:25.700 --> 09:29.567
[GASPS] OH, NO! MAYBE
THIS IS A STAIN ENLARGER!

09:29.567 --> 09:30.834
CHELS, STOP IT!

TO RETURN IT?

19:50.033 --> 19:51.867
UH...BECAUSE...

19:51.867 --> 19:53.667
IT WASN'T EXACTLY...

19:53.667 --> 19:55.700
REALLY WHAT I WAS
LOOKING FOR...

19:55.700 --> 19:58.000
THE OCCASION
I HAD TO WEAR IT.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.100
VERY WELL.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.467
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.367
THAT'S IT?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.600

MY MONEY BACK?
MM-HMM.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.367
OH...[SHRILLY] YAY!

20:06.367 --> 20:08.900
DON'T DANCE...YET.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.667
WHAT YOU NEED
TO SHOW ME

20:10.667 --> 20:14.100
TO GET YOUR MONEY
BACK IS THE RECEIPT.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.300
UH...RECEIPT.

20:16.300 --> 20:16.767
MM-HMM.

20:16.767 --> 20:19.033
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
THE RECEIPT.

20:19.033 --> 20:20.300
OH...

20:20.300 --> 20:21.867
NO RECEIPT?

20:21.867 --> 20:25.767
WELL, THEN, I ONLY
HAVE ONE WORD FOR YOU.

20:25.767 --> 20:26.367
NEXT!

20:26.367 --> 20:31.300
UH-UH! NO!
I AIN'T PLAYING.
STEP BACK, OK?

20:31.300 --> 20:33.133
ACTUALLY...

20:33.133 --> 20:34.934
I LEFT IT IN THE POCKET...

20:34.934 --> 20:37.967
NOW THAT I THINK
ABOUT THE SITUATION.

20:37.967 --> 20:39.467
LET ME JUST GET IT
FOR YOU,

20:39.467 --> 20:42.233
'CAUSE I REALLY NEED
TO GIVE YOU THIS TOP BACK.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.700
JUST WISH I COULD GET
THE<i>RECEIPT!</i>

20:44.700 --> 20:45.900
HERE IT IS...

20:45.900 --> 20:48.400
RIGHT HERE.
THAT'S IT?

20:48.400 --> 20:50.200
IT WOULD APPEAR SO.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.934
IT MUST HAVE,
YOU KNOW, SHRUNK
WHEN I WASHED IT.

20:53.934 --> 20:55.500
YOU DID WHAT?

20:55.500 --> 20:57.667
I HAD TO GET RID
OF THE STAIN!

20:57.667 --> 20:58.734
THE STAIN?

20:58.734 --> 21:00.500
RAVEN?
DAD?

21:00.500 --> 21:01.900
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

21:01.900 --> 21:05.300
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
SHE'S TRIED TO PULL
THE WOOL OVER MY EYES.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.400
SHE WORE THIS,
SHE STAINED IT,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.500
SHE WASHED IT,
SHE SHRUNK IT,

21:09.500 --> 21:11.934
AND NOW SHE HAS
THE AUDACITY

21:11.934 --> 21:14.967
TO COME AND TRY
TO RETURN IT!

21:14.967 --> 21:17.567
FRAHNK, WHY? WHY?

21:17.567 --> 21:19.700
RAVEN, IS THIS TRUE?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600

21:35.033 --> 21:39.867
OH, DAD. HOW MANY MORE
DISHES DO I HAVE TO DO?

21:39.867 --> 21:41.367
WELL, LET'S SEE.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.867
THE SHIRT COST ME $100

21:42.867 --> 21:44.867
PLUS $100 FOR
THE CALCULATOR.

21:44.867 --> 21:46.967

21:46.967 --> 21:48.233
