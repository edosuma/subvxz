"It Was a Pleasure Sharing"
...by Synchronized, Enjoy!

02:14.134 --> 02:15.700
I couldn't.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.268
You have to, Jerry.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.357
The best revenge is revenge.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.667
I mean come on, she cheated
on you first, right?

02:25.797 --> 02:27.582
So I have to cheat on her?

02:27.712 --> 02:29.061
You know what she's
gonna think if you don't?

02:29.192 --> 02:30.541
No, why?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.543
She's gonna mistake kindness
for weakness, all right?

02:32.674 --> 02:35.024
You'll be sending the wrong message.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.158
That it's all right to fuck
around without consequences.

02:38.288 --> 02:39.246
This will even the score.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.772
A healthy relationship
is an equal relationship.

02:48.255 --> 02:52.128
I don't know, who am I
gonna cheat with, Mort?

02:52.259 --> 02:53.825
Don't look at me, guys.

02:53.956 --> 02:54.783
You're on the list.

02:56.524 --> 02:59.179
Jerry, you're a good guy
and you're a great husband.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.747
- You think so?
- I know so

03:04.445 --> 03:07.143
and that is why I have
the perfect thing for you.

03:08.753 --> 03:12.279
Tonight, I'm getting you
the Special, my friend.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.325
- No, Mike, no, no.
- Oh yes, man.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.109
You're getting the Special.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.589
I'm not going to some
massage parlor whorehouse

03:18.720 --> 03:20.678
for a $5 happy ending I
could do myself for free.

03:20.809 --> 03:21.810
Gross, please.

03:23.638 --> 03:24.204
Trust me.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.859
It is not what you think.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.036
Before we go, I'm gonna need you

03:31.167 --> 03:33.213
to put this bag over your head.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.868
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

03:36.999 --> 03:39.436
Put that on your head
or you can forget it.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.003
Why?

03:41.133 --> 03:42.787
Because I know you
well enough and after

03:42.918 --> 03:44.876
you have what you're about to have,

03:45.007 --> 03:46.835
you're gonna go back
there every single night

03:46.965 --> 03:50.012
until you're broke and
even that won't be enough.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.840
So consider this a
preventative measure.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.364
Really?

03:54.495 --> 03:56.932
Yeah, really, just
put the bag on, come on.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.413
Okay, okay, fine.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.459
Yeah.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.028
Dick.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.247
You're gonna love it, man.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.032
You look good.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.513
Am I gonna suffocate in here?

04:12.643 --> 04:14.036
- Can you breathe now?
- Yeah.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.865
Then you're fine, can you see?

04:16.995 --> 04:18.214
- No.
- Are you sure?

04:18.345 --> 04:19.649
Mike, I can't see.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.303
How many fingers am I holding up?

04:21.435 --> 04:23.393
I don't know, four?

04:23.524 --> 04:24.394
That's a good guess.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.722
All right my friend, we have arrived.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.595
Can I take this off?

04:51.726 --> 04:53.293
Yeah, take it off.

04:58.210 --> 04:58.863
Where?

05:02.954 --> 05:05.914
Not a massage parlor, a
psychic front for a whorehouse.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.133
- Nice.
- Not just any psychic,

05:08.264 --> 05:10.266
Madam Zhora's.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.050
Your future is about to get rocked.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.271
- Oh god Mike, all right.
- Come on.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.664
Let's get this over with.

05:17.926 --> 05:18.883
Let's do it, come on.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.626
Come on, you are gonna be
thanking me so much, Jerry.

05:22.757 --> 05:25.716
- Who's house is this?
- Stop asking questions.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.850
Ladies.

05:50.654 --> 05:51.612
Are you the Special?

05:53.788 --> 05:57.879
Her name is Syn and believe
me, she lives up to the hype.

05:59.184 --> 05:59.794
Wow.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.187
Syn, you are

06:03.275 --> 06:03.972
gold-

06:04.929 --> 06:05.626
en.

06:08.890 --> 06:09.499
Like me?

06:19.117 --> 06:19.596
I like you, Jerry.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.862
How did you know my...

06:26.560 --> 06:27.648
You have it in your eyes.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.524
- You will want the Special.
- That's what we're here for.

06:38.441 --> 06:41.357
- She's not the Special?
- Her, no.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.101
- Which one is it then?
- Oh, none of these.

06:46.231 --> 06:50.061
I mean they all seem pretty
damn special to me, man.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.411
What do you want?

06:54.544 --> 06:57.765
Madame Zhora, we're
here for the special.

06:59.897 --> 07:00.681
Both of you?

07:00.811 --> 07:02.204
Oh no, just my buddy here.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.511
His eyes.

07:06.208 --> 07:06.861
Hey,

07:08.515 --> 07:09.429
I'm Jerry.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.520
Best sex of your life.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.220
Dracula is the Special?

07:18.350 --> 07:19.047
What?

07:20.614 --> 07:23.051
Oh hell no, no.

07:23.181 --> 07:24.705
You don't find me attractive?

07:27.359 --> 07:28.099
Or

07:29.231 --> 07:31.320
maybe you like Syn or

07:32.626 --> 07:33.583
my other dolls better, eh?

07:35.846 --> 07:37.587
Trust me Jerry, after five minutes,

07:37.718 --> 07:39.676
you're gonna be
forgetting all about Lisa.

07:41.286 --> 07:44.464
- $60 now.
- Since when?

07:44.594 --> 07:45.769
Since the last time.

07:57.651 --> 07:58.869
Wait, there's nobody in here.

08:12.796 --> 08:13.797
What the fuck?

08:33.730 --> 08:34.688
What?

08:46.787 --> 08:47.744
No way.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.808
Mike, this is some kind of joke.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.873
Ugh, that's creepy.

09:31.527 --> 09:32.223
Oh, gross.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.140
Where am I?

09:42.364 --> 09:43.713
You know what they
say, when in Rome, right?

09:46.020 --> 09:46.586
All right.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.415
Oh, I like this room.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.158
So Syn, what are you...

09:54.289 --> 09:57.074
It's a shame you don't have it.

09:57.205 --> 10:00.295
Oh, I got it and believe
me, I'm gonna bring it.

10:02.036 --> 10:02.732
A few times, apparently.

10:22.491 --> 10:23.187
Wow.

10:52.782 --> 10:53.783
Dick in a box.

11:07.579 --> 11:11.496
I don't know where to
put my hands, okay.

11:16.850 --> 11:17.720
Just the tip.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.053
Jerry has found the Special.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.724
Get your friend, I
am missing my shows.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.377
Okay, relax, "Matlock" is on

12:06.508 --> 12:08.771
like five times a day, lady.

12:13.254 --> 12:13.994
Ah, jeez.

12:16.561 --> 12:17.562
Jerry.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.173
He breathes?

12:19.303 --> 12:20.957
He bleeds?

12:21.088 --> 12:22.742
Breathes, breathes, he's breathing.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.352
I think so, I'm not a doctor.

12:25.614 --> 12:26.789
Like she's not a psychic, right?

12:28.182 --> 12:29.487
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ivan.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.492
- Hey Mike?
- Yeah Jerry, Jerry?

12:34.623 --> 12:35.667
- Mike.
- Hey man.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.933
- Jerry.
- Where is your car?

12:40.063 --> 12:41.891
Hey, hey, hey, hey, get off him, man.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.197
He's still got a half chop hanging out.

12:43.327 --> 12:44.938
I can't take him outside like this.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.417
- So dress him.
- Me?

12:46.548 --> 12:48.158
Isn't it what you guys get paid for?

12:49.507 --> 12:50.421
All right, jimmies

12:55.209 --> 12:57.689
and there's a lot of
sticky DNA on here.

13:00.649 --> 13:01.824
There you go, there you go.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.567
- The car?
- It's out front.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.439
It's gonna be all right, Jerry.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.398
- Take the feet.
- Oh, god.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.662
Okay.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.491
Hey, hey, hey, let me get
his jacket, it's wintertime.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.277
This is fun, all right.

13:20.408 --> 13:23.628
Don't bring this one back,
tell him to not return.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.371
He is what it wants.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.504
Okay, understood.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.908
- What the fuck?
- Didn't I tell you?

13:43.735 --> 13:46.129
Hey, just to be transparent, I did have

13:46.260 --> 13:48.479
to hold onto your penis while
we lifted you into the car.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.787
You had one of those
four hour Viagra boners.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.310
Yeah, I still do, dude.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.834
Oh man, no.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.967
God, what the hell was in that box?

13:58.098 --> 14:01.362
It is best not to ask, trust me.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.973
Yeah, I guess, I mean
who the hell cares, right?

14:04.104 --> 14:05.714
Exactly.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.979
Please Mike, please.

14:13.374 --> 14:16.856
See what I tell you, the
answer's no, all right?

14:16.986 --> 14:19.032
- One and done.
- Come on.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.685
- I'm your best friend.
- Yeah, I'm your best friend.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.296
I'm doing you a favor here, all right?

14:22.426 --> 14:24.994
Just forget about it, shake it off.

14:25.125 --> 14:28.258
Just go in there and you
tell Lisa about how you

14:28.389 --> 14:31.958
just had the best sex of
your fucking life with a box.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.658
Hey, you be a good boy

14:36.788 --> 14:39.052
and I'll set you up with
Syn next time, all right?

14:39.182 --> 14:40.967
She's pretty far out, trust me.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.970
Just once a week, fuck
the bar, I need this, man.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.711
Hey, hey, hey, baby steps.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.061
Baby steps, we'll see.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.811
Where have you been?

14:59.942 --> 15:01.161
Where does it look like, Lis?

15:04.251 --> 15:05.774
Out drinking with Mike again?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.037
I was drinking with Jerry.

15:09.821 --> 15:10.561
- Hey.
- What?

15:11.998 --> 15:14.304
How'd you find out about, you know?

15:14.435 --> 15:18.004
Oh you know, drunk friend
of a friend type thing.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.310
He must be a pretty good
customer because then one day,

15:20.441 --> 15:24.140
that old lady, she
offered me the Special.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.316
Shit.

15:27.056 --> 15:30.712
I did it once, once is enough.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.236
Why, is there some kind
of rule or something?

15:33.367 --> 15:35.499
Talk to Syn, she knows.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.328
Once is enough.

15:42.071 --> 15:42.942
Thanks, man.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.596
That's what I do.

15:45.727 --> 15:46.771
For the support.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.035
Yeah, don't mention it, man.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.863
- Are we square?
- Yeah.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.039
- I got this.
- You got it.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.349
Hey, don't forget the Rhyerson files.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.307
Yeah, yeah.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.139
No, I'm cool, thanks.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.666
I think I'm just gonna go to sleep.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.495
I'm pregnant, Jerry.

16:18.934 --> 16:19.935
Are you serious?

16:22.024 --> 16:24.374
I thought, I thought my...

16:25.941 --> 16:26.811
Your swimmers swim.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.123
Are you sure it's mine?

16:39.911 --> 16:41.261
You know, I'm just not feeling

16:41.391 --> 16:44.612
really well and I'm just shocked.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.355
This is big news.

16:52.098 --> 16:52.968
Right?

17:41.364 --> 17:42.844
- Hey Trudy.
- Good morning, Jerry.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.106
You need to see
these new pictures...

17:44.237 --> 17:45.151
Bye, Trudy.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.459
Yo, buddy.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.029
What?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.118
Oh come on, we
didn't drink that much.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.946
You didn't.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.384
After you got home?

18:07.999 --> 18:09.392
So you told her, huh?

18:09.523 --> 18:10.089
No.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.919
- She told me she's pregnant.
- What?

18:15.050 --> 18:16.704
Holy shit.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.053
And she said I was having

18:18.184 --> 18:20.273
some kind of wet dream last night.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.188
Apparently I was saying some
shit in my sleep, so she

18:22.318 --> 18:24.712
flat out asked me this morning
if I fucked someone else.

18:26.496 --> 18:27.932
And then she told me that

18:28.063 --> 18:30.500
she bought me a
snowblower for my birthday

18:30.631 --> 18:32.502
and the guy that's
she's been going to see

18:32.633 --> 18:33.895
down at the shopping center she texts

18:34.025 --> 18:36.071
is the goddamn fucking salesman, Mike.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.293
And you're buying that?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.338
Who texts a snowblower salesman?

18:42.469 --> 18:45.515
I don't know Mike, she's
my wife and I trust her

18:45.646 --> 18:48.649
and now I cheated on her
because I listened to you.

18:48.779 --> 18:49.476
Whoa.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.697
Do not blame me, we were drinking.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.177
You were sober enough to drive.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.918
We knew what the fuck we were doing.

18:58.746 --> 18:59.399
Jerry,

19:02.445 --> 19:04.969
I'm gonna give you a little
piece of wisdom here, okay?

19:06.362 --> 19:08.973
Just forget about it,
forget it ever happened.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.236
Hey, the whole thing was a wet dream.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.240
Yeah, I mean it's not like

19:14.370 --> 19:16.111
it was real pussy anyway, was it?

19:17.721 --> 19:19.375
It's kinda like using one of those.

19:19.506 --> 19:22.030
Fleshlights or jacking off
to porn, is that cheating?

19:23.379 --> 19:25.425
That's a little
above my pay grade but

19:25.555 --> 19:28.384
just forget it ever
happened, all right?

19:28.515 --> 19:30.081
So tell me where the place is.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.476
Did you just miss
the whole conversation?

19:33.607 --> 19:35.522
I said it never happened,
I said forget it.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.177
Come on Mike, you owe me that.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.613
I should've never

19:39.743 --> 19:40.657
brought you there in the first place.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.398
Yeah, but you did.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.357
You have reached Mystic Wanda.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.707
I can't come to the phone right now

20:30.838 --> 20:34.320
due to unforeseen circumstances
but please leave your...

20:46.245 --> 20:48.595
Oh, the clients called
about tomorrow's meeting.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.379
Lunch.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.685
It's a little early
for lunch, isn't it?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.166
What do you want me
to tell the clients?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.517
Tell them I'm going to lunch.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.214
Is Mike going with you?

21:01.216 --> 21:02.261
You fucking see Mike?

21:38.688 --> 21:40.473
I see that we're
running low on time now

21:40.603 --> 21:42.866
but I think we've accomplished
a lot with this reading.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.696
So I want you to take
what we've uncovered now

21:48.219 --> 21:50.004
and put that to good use over the next

21:50.134 --> 21:52.223
couple of months and then
I will see you again.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.184
I'll be right with you.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.753
Yeah, I'm on my lunch break,
I don't have a lot of time.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.016
- Then please sit down.
- No.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.323
Can you just tell me where
to find Madame Zhora?

22:05.759 --> 22:08.109
I don't know who
you're talking about.

22:08.239 --> 22:11.460
You're a psychic and you
can't find another psychic?

22:11.591 --> 22:12.722
Great, you're all full
of shit, I get it.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.117
Ring any bells, Morticia?

22:24.386 --> 22:26.519
Just in case, just in case.

22:43.927 --> 22:47.453
- Closed, come back later.
- No, no, wait.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.628
I'm here for the Special.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.501
- Syn is not here.
- No, no Syn.

22:54.808 --> 22:55.417
The Special.

22:59.552 --> 23:00.379
I seem to remember you.

23:03.164 --> 23:03.860
Your eyes.

23:05.993 --> 23:06.428
I'll pay double.

24:46.963 --> 24:47.747
- No, no.
- No.

25:05.895 --> 25:06.853
No.

27:37.786 --> 27:38.700
What can I get ya?

27:41.660 --> 27:45.185
Hey, I was just wondering
if you have weekly rates here?

27:46.795 --> 27:48.231
Hmm, you look more
like a minute man to me.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.234
We got hourly, we got weekly,

27:51.365 --> 27:52.888
you can get six nights for 250.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.501
Yeah, that sounds good, six nights.

27:58.589 --> 27:59.721
If you're on disability,

27:59.852 --> 28:00.940
fill this out so my ass gets paid.

28:02.419 --> 28:03.594
No, I don't need that.

28:05.553 --> 28:06.423
Cash or card?

28:17.652 --> 28:19.045
Just use my card.

28:37.150 --> 28:40.675
All right, you're gonna be upstairs,

28:40.806 --> 28:42.285
second door on the left.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.636
I got a couple simple rules up in here.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.031
Piss and shit in the toilet,

28:49.162 --> 28:51.294
clean up your mess on the
bed or wherever you make it.

28:51.425 --> 28:52.731
Don't leave that shit for me

28:54.167 --> 28:55.951
and when you return the
key, you don't bring it

28:56.082 --> 28:58.954
down here, you bring it
upstairs to me, got it?

28:59.085 --> 29:00.303
- Yeah.
- Hey.

29:01.827 --> 29:02.958
When you leave, take the body with you.

29:05.526 --> 29:06.222
What?

30:40.099 --> 30:41.056
Fuck.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.559
Okay.

31:06.473 --> 31:07.387
That's good.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.347
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

31:11.478 --> 31:14.263
- You're the new guest here?
- Yeah I am, why?

31:14.394 --> 31:15.917
Do you want the room cleaned?

31:16.048 --> 31:17.527
No, I don't need anything,
don't worry about it.

31:17.658 --> 31:18.964
Don't change the towels,
don't change the bed.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.487
Just don't come in for any reason.

31:20.617 --> 31:22.184
- The floor and the bathroom?
- No, no, nothing.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.620
Nada, okay?

31:23.751 --> 31:25.535
Just stay out of the
room, okay, all right?

31:25.666 --> 31:27.537
Okay, I'll stay out
while you're there.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.454
You don't go in there for any reason.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.108
Not when I'm here,
not when I'm not here.

31:33.239 --> 31:35.371
What the fuck is so hard about that?

31:35.502 --> 31:38.331
Okay, okay, I'll stay out.

31:38.461 --> 31:39.201
That a girl.

31:41.029 --> 31:41.900
Fuck.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.253
Come on in, please.

31:48.907 --> 31:49.908
It's okay, I'll stay here.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.786
Where are your employees?

31:58.917 --> 32:00.005
It's just and Madame.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.881
And how long have you worked for,

32:08.274 --> 32:10.450
I'm sorry, what's her real name again?

32:11.842 --> 32:12.756
Anya Gribinsky.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.759
I have been with Madame always.

32:17.936 --> 32:18.980
And what do you do for her?

32:21.287 --> 32:23.854
- Security and maintenance.
- Really?

32:25.204 --> 32:26.596
There's enough riff
raff in a fortune teller

32:26.727 --> 32:28.511
joint to have a guy
like you as a bouncer?

32:31.427 --> 32:32.385
This place has a smell.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.649
When you've been doing this for awhile,

32:35.779 --> 32:38.739
you can almost be blind
and know where you are.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.741
Yeah, locker rooms
have their own smell.

32:42.395 --> 32:45.180
Bowling alleys, strip clubs.

32:48.140 --> 32:49.097
Bodies give off pheromones,
did you know that?

32:52.535 --> 32:55.277
Tell me Detective, what
is it that you smell?

32:59.499 --> 33:00.108
Tea,

33:01.109 --> 33:02.110
cigarettes.

33:03.633 --> 33:04.330
Pussy.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.204
I tell you already,

33:09.335 --> 33:12.555
I go to the store and she knows

33:12.686 --> 33:14.949
do not let anyone in
until Ivan returns.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.299
But she does not listen.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.738
Anything else I do not know.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.005
You have no idea who
could've done this?

33:27.135 --> 33:28.441
I am not the psychic.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.493
Kimosabe, where were you?

33:38.712 --> 33:40.061
- What do you mean?
- Lunch.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.497
I came by, you were already gone.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.065
I just felt like being alone.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.850
I got a lot on my mind,
if you haven't guessed.

33:46.981 --> 33:47.634
That's all?

33:48.678 --> 33:50.071
Yeah Mike, that's all.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.380
All right.

33:54.510 --> 33:56.860
You know, no hard feelings.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.124
Nope, forgotten already.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.038
Really?

34:01.430 --> 34:02.910
Isn't that what you said I should do?

34:03.041 --> 34:06.000
Yeah, but I didn't
think you actually would.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.132
Yeah, well I am.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.004
I gotta make things right
with Lisa and hopefully

34:10.135 --> 34:12.353
in a week or two, everything
will be back to normal.

34:12.485 --> 34:13.399
Good place to start.

34:15.574 --> 34:17.620
Wanna hit Mort's after work tonight?

34:17.751 --> 34:21.188
No, I can't, I made reservations
with Lisa at Chang's.

34:22.842 --> 34:23.539
Have fun.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.851
So where's your
drinking buddy tonight?

34:31.982 --> 34:33.331
Ah, with the wife.

34:34.811 --> 34:35.768
Where you should be.

34:37.335 --> 34:39.164
When are you gonna get married, man?

34:39.293 --> 34:42.514
Come on Mort, you know I'm
not the marrying type and in

34:42.645 --> 34:45.213
fact, I don't even think humans
are meant to be monogamous.

34:45.344 --> 34:46.909
You know males are wired to spread

34:47.041 --> 34:49.696
their seed, like farm equipment.

34:49.826 --> 34:50.697
Is that right?

34:52.351 --> 34:54.309
Well then maybe I should've
been a farmer, huh?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.311
Yeah, maybe you should've.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.921
You okay with that
or you need another?

34:58.052 --> 34:59.184
- I'm fine.
- All right.

35:30.345 --> 35:34.219
We're downtown outside
of Anya Gribinsky's,

35:34.349 --> 35:37.352
known locally as Madame
Zhora's Psychic Parlor where

35:37.483 --> 35:42.096
police say Gribinsky, aged
72, was found dead upstairs.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.011
While local authorities
have no comment,

35:44.142 --> 35:46.318
foul play is suspected.

35:46.448 --> 35:49.016
Reporting from downtown,
this is Nick Roberts.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.148
Back to you, Susan.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.322
Fuck!

38:31.570 --> 38:32.527
Hey.

38:34.442 --> 38:35.313
How'd it go?

38:36.270 --> 38:37.184
How'd what go?

38:39.752 --> 38:41.667
The reason you're late.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.712
The meeting with Mr.
Rhyerson you called about.

38:43.843 --> 38:44.583
Oh yeah,

38:45.932 --> 38:47.194
it went fine.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.631
Is that really where you were?

38:52.591 --> 38:53.331
What do you mean?

38:55.811 --> 39:00.033
You weren't out drinking
with Mike or someone else?

39:00.163 --> 39:02.644
No, we talked about this, remember?

39:03.950 --> 39:04.690
We're good.

39:08.302 --> 39:09.216
Are we, Jerry?

39:14.482 --> 39:15.483
I'm not feeling well.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.821
What are you doing?

39:48.951 --> 39:50.170
I thought you were
watching your show.

39:51.693 --> 39:52.738
I am now.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.959
I was just getting ready
to come out and surprise you.

39:59.179 --> 40:00.093
Surprise, surprise.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.533
Jerry, slow.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.434
Oh, Jerry.

40:38.523 --> 40:39.785
Slow.

40:39.915 --> 40:40.786
Jerry, Jerry.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.767
- Where are you going?
- Work.

41:10.729 --> 41:13.471
The Rhyerson thing's put me way behind.

41:13.601 --> 41:14.733
I'd rather it cut into

41:14.863 --> 41:15.864
my mornings than my weekends, you know?

41:18.737 --> 41:19.694
I'll talk to you later.

42:12.181 --> 42:15.010
- This is Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

42:15.141 --> 42:15.881
Lisa, hey.

42:18.318 --> 42:20.407
Sorry to bother you at work but

42:20.538 --> 42:22.670
I was wondering if I could
talk to you about Jerry?

42:22.801 --> 42:23.976
Okay, what about?

42:25.934 --> 42:27.762
Does he seem like
himself to you lately?

42:29.329 --> 42:30.069
How do you mean?

42:31.505 --> 42:33.159
I don't know, it's just that

42:33.289 --> 42:36.031
he treated me like a one
night stand this morning.

42:36.162 --> 42:37.642
It's like he couldn't get
out of here quick enough.

42:40.819 --> 42:42.211
Good morning, Mr. Horford.

42:42.342 --> 42:44.692
No Frank, it's a
great fucking morning.

42:46.215 --> 42:47.347
Do you think he's cheating, Mike?

42:48.478 --> 42:49.131
No.

42:50.655 --> 42:51.264
You know,

42:53.309 --> 42:54.789
if he is, he hasn't told me about it.

42:56.486 --> 42:58.576
- You're late again.
- Not anymore.

42:58.706 --> 43:00.186
I need to know if this is an affair.

43:01.666 --> 43:04.233
If you see or hear anything suspicious,

43:04.364 --> 43:05.931
will you let me know?

43:06.061 --> 43:07.976
Yeah, of course.

43:08.107 --> 43:08.803
Sure.

43:12.198 --> 43:12.894
I hope so.

43:16.158 --> 43:18.247
Jeez, you look like shit.

43:19.727 --> 43:21.816
That my Lisa you were talking to?

43:21.947 --> 43:24.732
Actually it was and
you know why she called?

43:26.299 --> 43:28.083
She thinks you're having an affair.

43:28.214 --> 43:28.910
Are you?

43:30.564 --> 43:31.260
Am I what?

43:32.653 --> 43:34.481
Just because you want to fuck my wife

43:34.612 --> 43:36.614
doesn't mean you can talk
to her behind my back.

43:36.744 --> 43:38.528
Hey, she called me.

43:38.659 --> 43:40.139
Next time, don't answer.

44:16.262 --> 44:19.657
So, you've come to tell me
that you found who did this.

44:19.787 --> 44:21.136
No, but I hear you've

44:21.267 --> 44:22.442
been doing a little search of your own.

44:23.704 --> 44:24.836
But you found something.

44:26.576 --> 44:27.969
What we found is a lot of things that

44:28.100 --> 44:30.668
can't be traced back to
anyone with a record.

44:30.798 --> 44:31.756
I'm actually here because I'm wondering

44:31.886 --> 44:33.932
if whoever did this took
more than your boss.

44:35.716 --> 44:36.369
My boss?

44:37.762 --> 44:38.632
Madame.

44:40.112 --> 44:42.723
Nothing was taken but Madame's life.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.687
You ever have something
stuck in your tooth?

44:52.690 --> 44:53.952
A piece of popcorn maybe

44:54.082 --> 44:55.823
stuck in your teeth way back here?

44:55.954 --> 44:57.695
No matter how much you pick
at it, it won't come out.

44:57.825 --> 44:58.696
You ever had that happen?

44:59.609 --> 45:00.349
I floss.

45:08.053 --> 45:09.707
You don't seem very concerned with

45:09.837 --> 45:12.753
whether or not we find whoever
did this to Ms. Gribinsky.

45:12.884 --> 45:15.234
In fact, it's almost
as if you don't want us

45:15.364 --> 45:17.540
to catch this person and you
know what that makes me think?

45:19.238 --> 45:20.979
I am that's something
that's stuck in the tooth.

45:22.154 --> 45:23.068
Exactly.

45:24.286 --> 45:24.939
Yeah, exactly.

45:26.854 --> 45:30.205
Americans have a saying, "What
goes around, comes around."

45:32.251 --> 45:36.211
I think whoever did this
will get what they deserve.

45:40.302 --> 45:42.827
What's with the
occult books here, Ivan?

45:42.957 --> 45:44.219
Well, the occult was her career.

45:44.350 --> 45:47.266
Curses too, how much for
her to put a curse on someone?

45:49.007 --> 45:52.488
Madame did that for free,
I wish I had her powers.

45:54.012 --> 45:55.361
I would curse the man who did this.

45:55.491 --> 45:57.580
- So it was a man?
- I assume so, yes.

46:00.627 --> 46:03.804
Well Ivan, why would a man frequent

46:03.935 --> 46:05.458
a fortune teller, let alone kill one?

46:07.721 --> 46:08.853
Men want to know things too.

46:16.861 --> 46:17.644
Something's wrong?

46:20.473 --> 46:22.431
Yeah, you know, I find
a lot wrong actually.

46:23.824 --> 46:25.173
What was on this table again?

46:28.698 --> 46:29.395
A box.

46:30.744 --> 46:31.876
I like working with wood.

46:33.791 --> 46:34.530
A box for what?

46:36.402 --> 46:37.403
For putting things in.

46:39.274 --> 46:40.362
And where is this box?

47:01.383 --> 47:02.167
Ah, fuck.

47:45.036 --> 47:46.733
Yeah Trudy, this is Jerry.

47:48.517 --> 47:50.128
Can you tell Mr. Rolf I'm not
gonna make it back in today?

47:50.258 --> 47:51.912
I'm really sick.

47:52.043 --> 47:53.871
Brian, the doctor will see you now.

47:54.001 --> 47:56.874
Shit, yeah, sorry,
they're calling me in.

47:58.614 --> 47:59.572
Yeah, got it.

48:00.921 --> 48:03.315
- So you're married?
- Yes.

48:03.445 --> 48:05.621
You and your wife having
more sex than usual?

48:05.752 --> 48:09.060
No, less than usual actually, ow.

48:09.190 --> 48:10.278
Sorry.

48:11.801 --> 48:13.020
Are you having sex with
anyone other than your wife?

48:13.151 --> 48:14.935
No.

48:15.066 --> 48:17.068
- Are you sure.
- Unless I'm sleep-fucking no.

48:18.634 --> 48:20.332
- Fuck.
- Look.

48:20.462 --> 48:21.942
I can't help you if you're not honest.

48:22.073 --> 48:24.292
I'm not having sex
with anyone else, no.

48:24.423 --> 48:26.991
So you're masturbating
more than usual?

48:27.121 --> 48:30.516
Unless I'm using a cheese
grater, I mean look at this.

48:30.646 --> 48:33.258
I think it's spreading
and it comes and goes.

48:33.388 --> 48:35.086
It's all over my fucking
dick, man, what is this?

48:38.132 --> 48:39.655
I don't know.

48:39.786 --> 48:40.961
I'll tell you what, mister,

48:42.354 --> 48:45.574
Mr. Smith, whatever
it is that your penis

48:45.705 --> 48:47.750
and you are doing,
just do it less often.

48:49.622 --> 48:52.016
I'm gonna write you a prescription
for some LMX ointment.

48:54.279 --> 48:56.150
Go ahead and put that
on a couple times a day.

48:57.369 --> 48:58.022
See if that works.

49:00.850 --> 49:01.764
Fuck you.

49:11.078 --> 49:12.166
- Is it ready yet?
- Just a minute.

49:20.653 --> 49:21.915
You have a bathroom here?

49:24.396 --> 49:25.136
It's in the back.

49:33.057 --> 49:35.059
Do I need to tell you how to use this?

49:35.189 --> 49:36.799
Yeah, just rub it on my dick, right?

49:38.540 --> 49:40.455
Fuck.

49:43.981 --> 49:47.985
Oh.

50:12.139 --> 50:13.010
Jerry?

50:47.435 --> 50:49.133
Jerry, what are you doing?

50:49.263 --> 50:50.395
I'm sick.

50:57.141 --> 50:58.272
You don't feel hot.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.318
You can say that again.

51:02.233 --> 51:03.756
Is there anything I can do to help?

51:05.453 --> 51:07.238
No, I think I'm just
gonna try to sleep it off.

51:09.196 --> 51:10.545
I gotta get to work tomorrow.

51:15.768 --> 51:16.943
What kinda sick are you?

51:18.423 --> 51:21.426
I don't know, flu sick, cold sick.

51:22.470 --> 51:23.080
Why?

51:28.041 --> 51:29.521
I think I miscarried.

51:36.049 --> 51:37.311
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

51:41.010 --> 51:41.663
I'm sorry.

51:45.450 --> 51:46.277
You're sorry?

51:47.843 --> 51:49.410
- That's it?
- Where is this going?

51:54.111 --> 51:55.155
Lisa, I really need to sleep.

51:59.028 --> 52:00.247
It's going nowhere.

52:00.378 --> 52:01.857
Look, I don't have
a VD if that's what

52:01.988 --> 52:05.078
you're asking because again,
I am not cheating on you.

52:09.213 --> 52:09.909
Lis, Lis.

52:13.913 --> 52:14.696
We could try again.

52:22.226 --> 52:22.922
We will.

52:27.579 --> 52:28.580
It'll be okay.

52:35.935 --> 52:36.631
Please,

52:38.067 --> 52:39.373
can I just get some sleep please?

52:41.680 --> 52:42.376
Thanks.

54:23.303 --> 54:24.173
What the?

54:26.219 --> 54:27.916
No, no, no, no.

54:35.446 --> 54:36.360
Shit.

54:38.231 --> 54:39.363
No, no, no, no.

55:06.390 --> 55:07.391
Good morning sir, how are you?

55:09.218 --> 55:10.698
Anything I can help you with?

55:10.829 --> 55:12.309
No, no, I'm cool.

55:27.498 --> 55:30.457
Can I help you find something?

55:30.588 --> 55:31.545
Yeah.

55:32.764 --> 55:33.721
Yeah.

55:34.940 --> 55:38.335
I'm looking for, I don't
know what it's called.

55:38.465 --> 55:39.597
Yeah, I need to cut a lock.

55:41.076 --> 55:42.426
Like bolt cutters?

55:42.556 --> 55:45.124
Yeah, yeah, that'll work.

56:08.103 --> 56:09.235
How big is the lock?

56:09.366 --> 56:10.454
Shit, like this big.

56:12.717 --> 56:13.761
- These should work fine.
- Yeah.

56:13.892 --> 56:15.589
They're used, is that okay?

56:18.026 --> 56:19.550
Yeah, it's fine, that'll work.

56:49.231 --> 56:51.103
Yeah Trudy, it's Jerry.

56:51.233 --> 56:54.236
Thanks, I'm afraid I'm
still not feeling so well.

56:54.367 --> 56:58.110
So yeah, okay Trudy, yeah
I will, all right, okay.

57:29.924 --> 57:30.621
Shh.

58:29.593 --> 58:30.289
Fuck.

58:42.910 --> 58:44.042
Fuck, fuck, ah.

58:45.783 --> 58:46.697
Ah, okay.

58:55.314 --> 58:56.010
Okay.

59:17.554 --> 59:18.250
Hello?

59:19.947 --> 59:21.558
Hi Lisa, it's
Trudy from Mike's workplace.

59:23.472 --> 59:25.083
Oh hi Trudy, how are you?

59:25.213 --> 59:26.519
I'm okay,

59:26.650 --> 59:28.347
I just wanted to call
and check on Jerry.

59:30.958 --> 59:33.047
What do you mean, he's not at work?

59:33.178 --> 59:34.614
No, he called
in sick, something...

59:41.882 --> 59:43.144
What the hell?

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:38.635
I'd like to welcome the board back.

01:00:38.765 --> 01:00:40.462
I know I can do all of your counting

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:41.638
and don't worry about
it, I'm totally fine.

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:45.206
- Yes, you are.
- As you say.

01:00:47.513 --> 01:00:48.906
Yeah, man.

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:51.169
Okay, and
Parkington writes in his book

01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:53.650
a lot about his mental
problems specifically.

01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:16.368
I told you no cleaning here.

01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:20.328
And why not?

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:27.379
Lisa?

01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:30.034
Jerry.

01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:33.690
What are you doing here?

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:36.040
What do you think?

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.736
Open the door.

01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:39.304
Just wait a minute.

01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:43.482
Now Jerry or I swear to God

01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:45.658
I'm gonna scream rape
at the top of my lungs.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:47.965
One second.

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:49.053
Jerry.

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:57.844
Fuck, Jesus Christ, it stinks in here.

01:02:01.935 --> 01:02:03.154
- It's an old room.
- No.

01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:06.244
Something stinks.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:09.856
Is it her?

01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:13.991
Who?

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:17.472
The girl you're cheating on me with.

01:02:17.603 --> 01:02:19.257
At least I hope it's a girl.

01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:22.390
Lisa, we talked about this,
there's nothing going on.

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:24.218
You're gonna deny it
even though I caught you?

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.874
You're pathetic.

01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:32.009
Where is she?

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:35.229
Did she go in the bathroom now?

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.753
Don't go in there.

01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.233
I wonder why.

01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:43.411
How could you, Jerry?

01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.500
How could you?

01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:47.415
- Get off me.
- Lisa, no.

01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:49.069
Get off me, get off.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.723
Oh, fuck!

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:03.388
What the hell is that?

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:36.454
Not so much just that
first experience is that they

01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:39.326
like it enough to keep doing
it and then it's hard to stop.

01:05:39.457 --> 01:05:42.155
Listen, you do stuff
and you don't do stuff

01:05:42.286 --> 01:05:46.159
and you do stuff that keeps
on making you feel good

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.901
until it doesn't make you feel
good and you stop doing it.

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:50.207
That's what I tell the kids, you know?

01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:51.512
But the problem is,

01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:52.731
and as the Lord is a witness to it,

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:59.129
you keep doing it and you'll die.

01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:02.654
But with the stuff that
you've been doing...

01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:17.147
I don't know we keep
talking about my drug use.

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:51.442
I mean like it's just
that's the message

01:06:51.572 --> 01:06:53.792
that I'm giving you right
now as we're talking.

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:55.185
I understand that.

01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:57.448
When I see people that
are playing video games

01:06:57.578 --> 01:06:59.798
or doing heroin, it doesn't seem like

01:06:59.928 --> 01:07:02.018
they're having fun or living their life

01:07:02.148 --> 01:07:04.846
best suited to help make them feel good

01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:07.588
and it ends up making you feel bad.

01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:10.765
Fuck.

01:07:39.794 --> 01:07:41.535
Hey, hey, I'm Dick, how are ya?

01:07:44.495 --> 01:07:45.365
You're Jerry, right?

01:07:46.671 --> 01:07:48.368
Yeah, yeah, I'm Jerry.

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:50.109
- Cool.
- Yeah.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.850
Well if you can just put
your initials on there for me?

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:57.029
- So you're the guy.
- Excuse me?

01:07:59.162 --> 01:07:59.771
You're the guy.

01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:01.729
I'm the guy.

01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:06.908
Is your wife on her way here?

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:08.519
No, she's not on her way here.

01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:10.173
She asked me to meet you, so...

01:08:10.303 --> 01:08:12.000
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:13.872
Right, yeah.

01:08:14.002 --> 01:08:15.743
Hey, why don't I give you a once over?

01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:19.399
Hey Dick, I can read a manual
and figure it out myself.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:23.099
It's a snowblower, it's
not blowing me, is it?

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:27.625
- So where do you want it?
- We bought the stupid thing

01:08:27.755 --> 01:08:29.279
so you can drop the whole
bullshit salesman act, okay?

01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:33.412
Yeah, right Jerry, no problem.

01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:35.589
If you could just give
me your initials here?

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:42.335
Great, thanks.

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:22.941
Shh.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:17.778
Fuck.

01:12:04.537 --> 01:12:06.757
So out with the wife again, is he?

01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:08.672
Nope, he called in sick today.

01:12:14.504 --> 01:12:19.160
Hey Mort, turn the volume
up on that TV, hurry, hurry.

01:12:20.205 --> 01:12:21.032
Authorities have not released

01:12:21.162 --> 01:12:23.164
a list of suspects at this time.

01:12:23.295 --> 01:12:25.036
With more information on this story,

01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:29.475
I have Ivan Marovich,
caretaker at Madame Zhora's.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.566
Whoever did this, I
hope you are watching now.

01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:36.308
I know what is happening to you

01:12:37.657 --> 01:12:40.225
and I am the only one who can help you.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.184
So when you are ready
to accept my help,

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:46.274
I will be here waiting for you.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.328
- Did you clean up?
- It's clean enough.

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:58.330
Move out, scoot.

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:06.860
You know, you really don't look like

01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:09.820
the usual type of person I
get coming through this place.

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:12.170
It's a pretty high
class place you got here.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.171
That's real funny.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:15.782
No, I just mean like you don't look

01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:19.177
like a meth head or
some sloshed up drunk.

01:13:19.307 --> 01:13:21.701
What'd you do, molest somebody
and you're hiding out?

01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:23.355
Did you kill someone?

01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:25.052
Hey look, don't get me
wrong, I don't give a fuck

01:13:25.183 --> 01:13:27.098
one way or the other but they
come up in here to get you,

01:13:27.228 --> 01:13:28.882
I'm just gonna say I
didn't know anything.

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:33.539
- I took some towels.
- Take 'em.

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.237
Hell, you want my opinion,
you oughta burn 'em.

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:37.413
You can charge me for them.

01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:39.240
What, for cum rags?

01:13:39.371 --> 01:13:40.372
You'll ruin the house, man.

01:13:40.503 --> 01:13:41.329
Okay, all right.

01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:43.723
Get out.

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:03.482
Anybody home?

01:14:05.702 --> 01:14:06.659
Hello?

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.270
Lisa?

01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:14.493
Are you home?

01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:37.429
Lisa?

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.654
Lisa, are you in there?

01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:56.622
What the fuck?

01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:08.678
Fuck.

01:15:35.705 --> 01:15:36.619
Lisa,

01:15:38.795 --> 01:15:39.926
are you in here?

01:15:55.942 --> 01:15:57.465
What the fuck did you do?

01:16:24.014 --> 01:16:26.582
This is not what I
expected, what's up, Mike?

01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:27.583
Jerry.

01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:29.802
Hey, jeez.

01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:33.414
- You look like shit.
- Why, this?

01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:35.068
Yeah, it's just a rash.

01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:36.809
The doc gave me some kind of ointment,

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.769
he said it'll be all right,
it's pretty gross, right?

01:16:39.899 --> 01:16:42.554
Is that from that thing,
that thing in the tub?

01:16:42.685 --> 01:16:43.381
What?

01:16:45.078 --> 01:16:46.645
That's what that
guy was talking about.

01:16:46.776 --> 01:16:48.604
What who was talking about?

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:51.215
That guy, the big guy
from Madame Zhora's.

01:16:51.345 --> 01:16:54.000
He was on the TV, she's
dead you know and he said

01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:57.743
whoever did it, he's got
something that can fix it.

01:16:59.005 --> 01:17:00.659
Was it you?

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:02.182
Come on Mike, you believe that shit?

01:17:02.313 --> 01:17:04.010
He's just trying to trick me into

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:07.057
coming to him so he can
turn me in to the police.

01:17:07.187 --> 01:17:09.625
Okay, let's get you to the hospital.

01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:10.930
No, no, no hospital.

01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:12.410
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Jerry, look.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.151
How'd you get in here?

01:17:14.281 --> 01:17:16.327
Your garage door was
open, it's always open.

01:17:16.457 --> 01:17:19.591
Since when do you think you
can just walk into my house?

01:17:19.722 --> 01:17:21.854
Hey, I'm just here to help you, man.

01:17:21.985 --> 01:17:23.551
Help?

01:17:23.682 --> 01:17:25.597
I mean it's a little late for that.

01:17:25.728 --> 01:17:27.773
- Listen.
- Isn't it?

01:17:27.904 --> 01:17:29.949
Listen Jerry, if
you had anything to do

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.125
with Madame Zhora's death,
don't worry about it,

01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:33.953
we'll cover it up, tie up loose ends.

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:35.955
You can trust me, I'm your buddy.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.610
And Lisa?

01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:41.700
What about Lisa?

01:17:42.962 --> 01:17:43.833
She got in the way.

01:17:47.837 --> 01:17:49.403
No.

01:17:49.534 --> 01:17:50.187
No, Jerry, no.

01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:52.624
Hey, did you forget?

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:54.757
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

01:17:54.887 --> 01:17:56.323
Telling me to cheat on my wife.

01:17:56.454 --> 01:17:57.716
Is that your idea of help?

01:17:57.847 --> 01:17:59.805
I said one time, one
and done, don't go back.

01:17:59.936 --> 01:18:01.546
You didn't listen, fuck!

01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:55.339
Hey.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:57.994
Hey.

01:18:58.124 --> 01:18:58.734
Shh.

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:01.867
He didn't hurt you, did he?

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:04.087
Hey.

01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:07.873
Come here.

01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:12.051
Come here, beautiful.

01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:19.058
You okay?

01:20:30.651 --> 01:20:31.391
I'll be back later.

01:20:41.097 --> 01:20:42.838
Are you feeling okay?

01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:11.475
Happy birthday!

01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:14.173
What are you doing here?

01:21:14.304 --> 01:21:15.087
It's your birthday.

01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:17.568
It is?

01:21:17.698 --> 01:21:19.700
Are you okay, Jerry?

01:21:19.831 --> 01:21:20.876
Is that a rash?

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.008
I'm sick.

01:21:23.139 --> 01:21:26.229
Oh, you poor baby.

01:21:26.359 --> 01:21:27.534
But you can't be that sick

01:21:27.665 --> 01:21:29.841
because your wife didn't
call us and cancel.

01:21:29.972 --> 01:21:32.713
- She's sick too.
- Can we see her?

01:21:32.844 --> 01:21:33.976
No, she's sleeping, we both were.

01:21:36.282 --> 01:21:39.198
Look, thanks for coming,
I really appreciate it.

01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:42.462
But I'm sorry we didn't call you guys

01:21:42.593 --> 01:21:45.988
but the party's canceled and
you can just go now, thanks.

01:21:46.118 --> 01:21:47.903
- What do you mean?
- Come on, Jerry.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.165
We've been looking
forward to this all week.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.731
Would you just get off my property?

01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:51.907
I thought your wife was sleeping.

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:53.821
George, fuck off, both of you.

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:56.389
All of you, just get outta
here, get off my property.

01:21:57.825 --> 01:21:59.915
- I'm sick.
- Yeah, clearly.

01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:59.338
I see you got my message.

01:23:59.469 --> 01:24:00.557
Can you really help me?

01:24:01.819 --> 01:24:02.515
Of course.

01:24:04.343 --> 01:24:05.997
Is this what you took from us?

01:24:06.128 --> 01:24:09.087
- It is dead?
- No, I mean yeah.

01:24:10.306 --> 01:24:12.525
I don't know, I think it is.

01:24:14.658 --> 01:24:15.789
Can you fix it?

01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:22.927
Come with me.

01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:29.847
What are we doing in here?

01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:33.807
Sit down, try to relax

01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:36.636
while I see what I can
do about our friend.

01:24:36.767 --> 01:24:39.335
Wait, for what it's
worth, I'm really sorry.

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.470
Listen, to make up for it,
the business that you lost,

01:24:44.601 --> 01:24:47.299
I used part of it on me with my wife

01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:50.346
and it like rocked her world, man.

01:24:51.608 --> 01:24:53.566
It works inside a woman?

01:24:53.697 --> 01:24:55.438
I tried a little bit but it
does nothing for the girl.

01:24:55.568 --> 01:24:58.136
No, no, I put it on me first

01:24:58.267 --> 01:24:59.920
and it all happened inside of her.

01:25:01.531 --> 01:25:02.880
But who cares about what
it does for the girls?

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.100
It's all about the guys, right?

01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:08.364
They're your customer, as long
as it satisfies him, right?

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:11.497
A little bit of the
Special with my girls.

01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:13.499
- Something to think about.
- Yes.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.023
I mean maybe we could work together.

01:25:16.154 --> 01:25:17.373
I can help, we could be partners

01:25:17.503 --> 01:25:21.116
or something and I
can be with it again.

01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:26.338
Do not worry, you
will be with it again soon.

01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:29.211
So you'll be able to help it?

01:25:29.341 --> 01:25:32.127
Of course, I will get started.

01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.738
- Better if you relax now.
- Yes, thank you.

01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:51.483
You said you'd help me.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.183
No.

01:29:56.086 --> 01:29:57.783
Guess I could've
been the new psychic.

01:29:59.045 --> 01:30:01.221
I saw this one coming a mile away.

01:30:02.701 --> 01:30:04.268
So you are here to arrest me then?

01:30:06.313 --> 01:30:07.793
Actually I'm here because the money

01:30:07.924 --> 01:30:09.926
we found in Madame Zhora's
hand yielded DNA evidence.

01:30:12.494 --> 01:30:14.844
Jerry Horford, he sound familiar?

01:30:16.323 --> 01:30:17.412
I do not know him.

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:19.979
Well we think he was here.

01:30:20.110 --> 01:30:21.677
We think he may have
killed Madame Zhora.

01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:31.991
You like what you see?

01:30:37.693 --> 01:30:40.435
Maybe something less compromising.

01:30:45.962 --> 01:30:47.006
What are you implying?

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.574
Let me offer you something better.

01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:54.840
Let me give you the Special, no charge.

01:33:38.743 --> 01:33:42.051
So I just got back from my
stand up gig, you know the one.

01:33:42.181 --> 01:33:43.792
Remember I told you John van Tongeren

01:33:43.922 --> 01:33:45.489
and Michael Sweet were in the crowd?

01:33:47.143 --> 01:33:49.580
Well listen, you guys
have to come back with me.

01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:51.756
It was incredible.

01:33:51.887 --> 01:33:54.498
After my set, this guy told me
to go to this fortune teller.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:57.544
Listen, it's like a whorehouse.

01:33:57.675 --> 01:33:59.764
I was drinking with this guy

01:33:59.895 --> 01:34:01.766
and he told me to ask for the Special.
