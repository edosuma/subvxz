WEBVTT

00:01.178 --> 00:02.722
Previously on Empire...

00:02.746 --> 00:04.832
You'll only beat
Lucious if you play dirty.

00:04.832 --> 00:07.791
This is now a Lucious Lyon joint

00:07.792 --> 00:10.237
and we will do it right.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.339
I miss music.

00:12.363 --> 00:14.975
Why don't you give me a music segment?

00:14.999 --> 00:17.644
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, sweetheart. You good?

00:17.668 --> 00:20.314
Isn't it funny how the people
we thought we left in the past

00:20.338 --> 00:21.915
keep coming back to us?

00:21.939 --> 00:24.752
I'm just finally seeing you
for who you really are,

00:24.776 --> 00:25.819
and that ain't much.

00:27.812 --> 00:30.095
- Why are you here?
- Can we talk?

00:34.652 --> 00:37.531
I know I got lost along the way,

00:37.555 --> 00:41.034
but I'm here, same as you all...

00:41.058 --> 00:42.469
and that should count for something.

00:42.493 --> 00:43.737
So, what, you're down and played out?

00:43.761 --> 00:45.773
You finally see the light?

00:45.797 --> 00:47.608
Why the hell should we trust you?

00:47.632 --> 00:50.144
Because nobody understands

00:50.168 --> 00:53.447
how dangerous the Lyons are like I do.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.416
We all were hurt by them, Warren.

00:55.440 --> 00:58.318
The difference is, none of us
played house with that trash.

00:58.342 --> 01:00.821
It's more than hurt.

01:00.845 --> 01:02.122
They destroyed us.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.560
And they're alive and well...

01:07.919 --> 01:09.463
While...

01:09.487 --> 01:11.799
some of us are...

01:15.493 --> 01:17.704
So what exactly is
Little Warren prepared to do?

01:17.728 --> 01:19.973
I want what Aunt Diana wants...

01:21.532 --> 01:23.110
To make them pay...

01:24.535 --> 01:26.547
With blood.

01:34.111 --> 01:37.291
So I see you think
you got balls now, huh?

02:06.244 --> 02:09.122
I'm so excited to kick off
our new musical segment,

02:09.145 --> 02:11.792
The Hot Spot, where I get
to do what I do best,

02:11.816 --> 02:14.228
and that's showcase
the hottest new artists

02:14.252 --> 02:16.063
on their way to stardom.

02:16.087 --> 02:20.200
I would like to introduce
Bossy Media's Lala.

02:57.328 --> 02:59.273
She is making me look like a genius

02:59.297 --> 03:01.041
for demanding this musical segment.

03:01.065 --> 03:02.409
Thank you.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.411
No, thank you, Cookie.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.013
I support women promoting women,

03:06.037 --> 03:07.848
but women who promote Bossy?

03:07.872 --> 03:10.083
- Even better.
- Same. Also, hi.

03:10.107 --> 03:13.053
This musical segment of yours
is genius, okay?

03:13.077 --> 03:15.022
You about to be a whole
Oprah out here, girl.

03:15.046 --> 03:16.857
Well, trust me, I'm just
getting started.

03:24.355 --> 03:26.767
She better sing.
Where did she get that from?

03:26.791 --> 03:27.901
She didn't do that in rehearsal.

03:27.925 --> 03:29.136
It slap, don't it?

03:29.160 --> 03:30.404
More than that, though.

03:30.428 --> 03:32.773
I... I've heard that before.

03:32.797 --> 03:35.275
Actually, Lala has been getting

03:35.299 --> 03:37.411
some fairy godmother magic
from Melody.

03:37.435 --> 03:40.213
Backup on the right?
She's vocal coaching her.

03:41.906 --> 03:43.150
Well, thank y'all again.

04:02.793 --> 04:04.438
Wow, you hear that?
Yeah.

04:04.462 --> 04:07.975
Lala is now on the national radar.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.510
Well, all that clapping need
to translate into actual money,

04:10.534 --> 04:13.680
because if we want a real win,
we need an ASA nomination,

04:13.704 --> 04:16.315
which means media rollout,
which means, ergo, money.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.187
I cannot remember the last time

04:20.211 --> 04:22.489
that I spent the night with a woman

04:22.513 --> 04:24.558
and all we did was talk.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.861
Is that a complaint?

04:29.654 --> 04:31.531
Not with you, it's not.

04:31.555 --> 04:33.300
Okay, don't change the subject.

04:33.324 --> 04:36.470
So now, you said your mom
tried to make you believe

04:36.494 --> 04:37.638
that you were evil?

04:37.662 --> 04:40.941
I'm a grown-ass man, but...

04:40.965 --> 04:44.144
it was like this huge weight
had been lifted off of my soul

04:44.168 --> 04:47.214
to know that my mother didn't think

04:47.238 --> 04:49.683
that I was born a monster.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.318
Wow.

04:51.342 --> 04:52.853
Yeah.

04:52.877 --> 04:55.322
You know, we're all blessed
with free will

04:55.346 --> 04:57.062
to make our own choices.

04:57.948 --> 05:00.866
I can't say I always make
the right ones with mine.

05:02.053 --> 05:05.699
You know, I definitely won't
win Father of the Year award

05:05.723 --> 05:09.007
for none of my boys, especially Andre.

05:10.094 --> 05:13.407
Well, you supported Andre last night,

05:13.431 --> 05:16.209
so you can make that your first step.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.881
Yes, indeed.

05:25.876 --> 05:27.454
I am, um...

05:27.478 --> 05:30.424
I'm really happy
that we got to catch up.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.294
Yeah, we're... we're not done, right?

05:34.318 --> 05:35.562
Look at what we got here.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.764
Look at what we had here.

05:37.788 --> 05:40.500
No, you got me. You see me, Yana.

05:40.524 --> 05:41.535
Right.

05:41.559 --> 05:43.103
That's why it's a shame

05:43.127 --> 05:44.905
that I'm not in your life anymore,

05:44.929 --> 05:47.040
but that's the choice that you made

05:47.064 --> 05:49.743
when you decided to run off
with Uncle Ray's money

05:49.767 --> 05:52.417
and leave me in that motel.

05:53.070 --> 05:55.182
All right, I did that.

05:55.206 --> 05:56.750
Look, all right.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.618
Well, you don't leave
until tomorrow, right?

05:58.642 --> 06:00.620
So all I gotta do

06:00.644 --> 06:03.323
is stop in on this little
charity thing today,

06:03.347 --> 06:04.791
and then after that, I'm all yours.

06:04.815 --> 06:08.995
So why don't you and I
spend the day together?

06:09.019 --> 06:11.298
Maybe?

06:11.322 --> 06:13.433
- Fine.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.474
But I know what I want, Lucious.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.239
I want to know you.

06:19.263 --> 06:20.607
The real you.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.545
Well, you got me, then.

06:25.569 --> 06:27.147
All right, everybody,

06:27.171 --> 06:29.082
let's keep those donations rolling in.

06:29.106 --> 06:31.918
Next up, let's welcome
to the stage Prophetic.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.051
Brother's
even more gifted live.

07:05.075 --> 07:06.486
I see why he's independent.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.955
Why let anybody
mess with genius, right?

07:08.979 --> 07:10.490
Be careful
not to lay it on too thick.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.326
He's here to promote his cause
and not do business.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.362
Look, I get it, babe, okay?

07:15.386 --> 07:16.930
Guns took something from him

07:16.954 --> 07:18.698
that no amount of money
could bring back.

07:18.722 --> 07:20.834
But if he managed to build
a career from that tragedy,

07:20.858 --> 07:23.937
I know I can convince him
that Empire's the one place

07:23.961 --> 07:25.539
that genuinely gets him.

07:25.563 --> 07:26.973
Not even Lucious
could make him see that,

07:26.997 --> 07:28.508
and he tried more than once,
believe me.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.478
Let's go sign your unsignable genius.

07:31.502 --> 07:33.480
Let's.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.797
Andre Lyon, everybody.

07:50.821 --> 07:52.966
Thank you.

07:52.990 --> 07:55.535
My family has seen more
than its share of gun violence,

07:55.559 --> 07:56.570
and this brother

07:56.594 --> 07:58.338
lost his father

07:58.362 --> 08:01.174
and his brother and his best friend.

08:01.198 --> 08:03.577
Now, given our share of tragedy,

08:03.601 --> 08:05.178
it's only right
that we follow his lead

08:05.202 --> 08:08.882
in wiping the scourge of guns
from our streets.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.684
The Empire family wants to help.

08:10.708 --> 08:13.053
It is our honor to make a contribution

08:13.077 --> 08:15.055
to an organization dedicated to...

08:15.079 --> 08:17.224
bringing about a better,
safer world for all of us.

08:17.248 --> 08:20.227
So on behalf of Empire,

08:20.251 --> 08:23.663
I present this check for $10 million

08:23.687 --> 08:25.866
to Guns Down, Fists Up.

08:27.892 --> 08:29.708
Congratulations, brother.

08:31.395 --> 08:34.241
Wow.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.375
You have saved many a black life

08:35.399 --> 08:36.409
with this one, my good brother.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.078
Thank you, Andre.

08:39.403 --> 08:42.616
So now let us celebrate life,

08:42.640 --> 08:46.086
and please, find your way
to donating even a dollar,

08:46.110 --> 08:48.388
as no amount is too small

08:48.412 --> 08:50.323
because no black life is too high.

08:53.284 --> 08:55.762
Yes, sir.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.331
After today,
Guns Down, Fists Up is gonna go

08:58.355 --> 08:59.766
from indie to double platinum.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.434
Indeed, my good brother.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.904
I am grateful
beyond mere words for this.

09:03.928 --> 09:05.138
Well, when I believe in something,

09:05.162 --> 09:06.640
I do what it takes to make it real.

09:06.664 --> 09:09.276
That's my operating principle
at Empire.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.378
Listen, I... I understand
your hesitation

09:11.402 --> 09:12.913
about signing with a label, okay?

09:12.937 --> 09:16.216
I... I do, but you heard
me out there, man.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.051
We're more than a label. We're family.

09:18.075 --> 09:19.085
- A family.
- That's right.

09:19.109 --> 09:20.587
Indeed. I get it.

09:21.946 --> 09:23.590
Let me not waste your time.

09:23.614 --> 09:25.625
I've already respectfully
declined your father.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.594
Repeatedly.

09:27.618 --> 09:29.262
Again...

09:29.286 --> 09:33.233
I appreciate what you did
out there, black man.

09:33.257 --> 09:34.601
All of it.

09:34.625 --> 09:37.537
Lucious' Empire
is not my Empire, okay?

09:37.561 --> 09:40.040
I'm taking this company in an
entirely different direction.

09:40.064 --> 09:41.641
Let me walk you through
what I have for you...

09:41.665 --> 09:44.110
Brother, exchanging one Lyon
to another

09:44.134 --> 09:45.879
does not matter to me.

09:45.903 --> 09:48.281
I'm not signing to anybody

09:48.305 --> 09:50.617
because I don't answer to anybody.

09:50.641 --> 09:52.652
And we will respect
your autonomy, brother,

09:52.676 --> 09:53.954
but you gotta see this thing

09:53.978 --> 09:56.122
through the lens of your entire brand.

09:56.146 --> 09:58.625
Imagine what the size
and weight of Empire could do

09:58.649 --> 10:01.561
for your Guns Down, Fists Up program.

10:01.585 --> 10:04.064
So your little donation
comes with invisible strings?

10:06.123 --> 10:08.635
I'll tell you what.

10:08.659 --> 10:10.804
Keep that check.

10:10.828 --> 10:12.505
We good.

10:13.731 --> 10:14.975
W-wait, I didn't mean that...

10:14.999 --> 10:17.277
We are good, Andre.

10:19.636 --> 10:21.214
Peace, brother.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.953
Lucious.

10:29.913 --> 10:32.292
Save the lecture, Pop.

10:32.316 --> 10:34.060
Nah. About him?

10:34.084 --> 10:37.063
He'd have been an asset,
but ain't the only one.

10:37.087 --> 10:39.532
He would have been huge
for us right now, Pop.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.701
You did a great thing
for a great cause,

10:41.725 --> 10:44.504
and Empire has never been defined

10:44.528 --> 10:46.906
by a single damn artist.

10:46.930 --> 10:49.042
There will be other Prophetics.

10:50.401 --> 10:52.612
And for me,
I gotta take a personal day,

10:52.636 --> 10:55.715
so I'm going to leave the keys
to the kingdom in your hands.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.350
The keys?

10:57.374 --> 10:59.719
I've been running Empire solo
for months now, Pop.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.921
That came off wrong.

11:01.945 --> 11:05.625
You've been holding it down,
and I'm sorry

11:05.649 --> 11:08.495
if I didn't act like I appreciated it,

11:08.519 --> 11:10.563
because I do.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.099
Okay, I appreciate that.

11:13.123 --> 11:14.100
I do. Thank you.

11:14.124 --> 11:16.102
Just breathe, huh?

11:16.126 --> 11:18.838
- Okay.

11:20.030 --> 11:22.742
Oh, come on.

11:22.766 --> 11:26.613
You're not buying Dad's little
community theater performance,

11:26.637 --> 11:28.214
are you?

11:33.644 --> 11:35.121
Oh, hey, there you are.

11:35.145 --> 11:36.623
Where did you want to go
for lunch?

11:36.647 --> 11:38.391
- Lunch?
- Did you forget?

11:38.415 --> 11:40.160
We were talking next steps
with Philly Street.

11:40.184 --> 11:43.897
Oh, well, look, Trace, we gon'
have to reschedule, okay?

11:48.092 --> 11:51.471
Papa Bear is setting you up
for failure.

11:53.831 --> 11:55.842
And I'd be a fool to fall for it.

11:55.866 --> 11:58.912
Mm. Now, the good thing
is that with Lucious away,

11:58.936 --> 12:00.980
you and I can play.

12:01.004 --> 12:04.484
We are going to need another go
at Prophetic.

12:04.508 --> 12:06.820
Now, you tried the nice way.

12:06.844 --> 12:09.122
How about we do it
the right way, little brother?

12:10.981 --> 12:12.564
I'm already ahead of you.

12:18.144 --> 12:21.685
Oh, thank you so much.
You know, it's only been...

12:21.686 --> 12:23.630
So anyway, Becky, let me...

12:23.654 --> 12:24.965
Yes?

12:24.989 --> 12:28.435
Oh, I know that is not my soror!

12:28.459 --> 12:30.938
- Oh, my...

12:30.962 --> 12:32.562
- Okay.

12:32.563 --> 12:34.507
Should have known.

12:34.531 --> 12:36.132
Well, damn, you look good.

12:36.133 --> 12:38.278
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

12:38.302 --> 12:40.614
Wow, so you guys, like,
went to college together?

12:40.638 --> 12:42.749
- Hold on.

12:42.773 --> 12:45.152
I smell a little vibe
of drama or something.

12:45.176 --> 12:47.421
Did you guys hate each
other or like each other?

12:47.445 --> 12:48.822
- Um...
- Depended on the day.

12:48.846 --> 12:50.190
- Yeah.
- Oh.

12:50.214 --> 12:52.192
We were roommates the first two years.

12:52.216 --> 12:53.694
I studied all the seconds
of all the days,

12:53.718 --> 12:54.728
and you got the good grades.

12:54.752 --> 12:56.430
I cheated.

12:56.454 --> 12:58.565
Are you serious?

12:58.589 --> 13:01.201
Girl, no. No, I didn't.

13:01.225 --> 13:03.003
Stop hating.

13:03.027 --> 13:05.706
- Once a hater, always a hater.
- That's true about her.

13:05.730 --> 13:07.441
- Oh, hey.
- She still is one.

13:07.465 --> 13:10.277
But you are killing it.
I mean, you own Bossy now.

13:10.301 --> 13:12.212
Yeah, we are.

13:12.236 --> 13:14.548
- It's a lot of hard work.
- We're in a good place.

13:14.572 --> 13:16.016
It's hard work.
- Yeah.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.352
But we are blessed to be killing it.

13:18.376 --> 13:20.354
- Yes.
- I'm really proud of you.

13:20.378 --> 13:21.922
I don't know. Is it weird to say that?

13:21.946 --> 13:23.857
No, it's not. Be proud of us.

13:23.881 --> 13:26.827
Um, this has been weighing
on me all these years.

13:26.851 --> 13:28.261
You know, um,

13:28.285 --> 13:31.098
when I was really mean
to you back in the day,

13:31.122 --> 13:32.699
spreading those rumors about you

13:32.723 --> 13:35.097
when you took that semester off.

13:35.121 --> 13:36.932
I'm so sorry, Giselle.

13:36.956 --> 13:39.334
Uh, well, we were kids.

13:39.358 --> 13:41.737
- And thank you.
- Uh, thanks.

13:43.729 --> 13:46.642
- Ah, so what do you do, sis?
- Oh, I'm a day trader.

13:46.666 --> 13:50.278
I stare at boring,
soul-crushing numbers 24-7.

13:50.302 --> 13:52.047
If I could have your attention,

13:52.071 --> 13:54.883
please welcome
Ms. Sarah Lawson to the stage.

13:54.907 --> 13:56.118
- Oh, you're that Sarah Lawson.
Excuse me.

13:56.142 --> 13:57.386
Oh, you're that Sarah Law...

13:57.410 --> 13:59.087
Okay!

14:04.150 --> 14:06.228
Gun violence is one of our nation's

14:06.252 --> 14:08.264
biggest unanswered problems.

14:08.288 --> 14:10.933
That's why I am so honored
to be here tonight

14:10.957 --> 14:14.470
making my very own pledge
for $2 million.

14:15.962 --> 14:18.707
What?

14:18.731 --> 14:20.442
Did you know your friend was rich?

14:26.005 --> 14:27.650
Yes! "Skee whee!"

14:27.674 --> 14:29.285
- Right? All of us.
- No. No.

14:29.309 --> 14:32.121
I am so happy you could make it.

14:32.145 --> 14:33.956
Anyone with a link to Lucious' past

14:33.980 --> 14:35.925
makes for a valuable resource.

14:35.949 --> 14:38.427
Um, tell me about the pages

14:38.451 --> 14:40.462
Lucious had you leave out.

14:40.486 --> 14:42.231
I thought that they added flavor,

14:42.255 --> 14:44.800
but he felt that they
distracted from the story.

14:44.824 --> 14:46.101
- Ah.
- That's what you get

14:46.125 --> 14:47.603
when the protagonist is a producer.

14:47.627 --> 14:49.338
Yeah?

14:49.362 --> 14:53.008
What other juicy flavors did
Lucious want you to leave out?

14:53.032 --> 14:54.643
I'm not sure I should be

14:54.667 --> 14:56.478
sharing script revisions with you.

14:56.502 --> 14:59.215
I am one of Lucious' oldest friends,

14:59.239 --> 15:02.218
and I am part owner of Empire.

15:02.242 --> 15:07.289
I just want to make sure
your story is... accurate.

15:07.313 --> 15:10.359
If you want me to tell Lucious
you wouldn't play ball,

15:10.383 --> 15:11.360
no problem.

15:11.384 --> 15:13.629
Uh, okay, then.

15:13.653 --> 15:14.897
Uh, there is something

15:14.921 --> 15:16.665
I'm trying to get to the bottom of.

15:16.689 --> 15:20.169
There's an older rumor about
Philly Street getting robbed

15:20.193 --> 15:22.471
right around the time
Lucious' star began to rise.

15:22.495 --> 15:25.040
That's not exactly a smoking gun.

15:26.232 --> 15:28.877
This is an old basement tape

15:28.901 --> 15:31.947
of Shine freestyling
about the robbery.

15:31.971 --> 15:33.782
It never came out.

15:35.241 --> 15:37.720
Wow,
you really do your research.

15:37.744 --> 15:39.888
I mean, we just all thought

15:39.912 --> 15:42.458
that nonsense was buried years ago.

15:42.482 --> 15:44.326
Can I borrow this tape?

15:44.350 --> 15:48.063
And you'll let me read the pages too?

15:48.087 --> 15:50.165
Just to see if it...
it sparks something

15:50.189 --> 15:52.534
that could help you.

15:52.558 --> 15:54.503
You'll tell Lucious
that I played ball?

15:54.527 --> 15:57.206
Of course I will.

16:00.199 --> 16:02.578
You know, you are really talented.

16:04.203 --> 16:06.015
Okay.

16:26.426 --> 16:27.903
Yes, that's good.

16:27.927 --> 16:29.505
But don't drop off at the end, okay?

16:29.529 --> 16:30.673
- Okay.
- Keep that vibrato strong

16:30.697 --> 16:31.874
before you hit that final riff.

16:31.898 --> 16:33.542
- Okay. Got you.
- Okay.

16:33.566 --> 16:36.350
Lala, can I have a word
with your girl?

16:37.136 --> 16:38.414
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:38.438 --> 16:39.948
You sound amazing.

16:39.972 --> 16:41.550
Thank you.

16:41.574 --> 16:43.052
I'm Cookie.

16:43.076 --> 16:44.620
I'm familiar.

16:44.644 --> 16:47.256
So you're Lala's musical sensei, huh?

16:47.280 --> 16:50.793
I don't know about all that,
but we working together, yeah.

16:50.817 --> 16:53.062
That run she did on the Tea Talk,

16:53.086 --> 16:54.296
did you teach her that?

16:54.320 --> 16:56.498
If that's what she says, okay.

16:56.522 --> 16:58.133
Can't stop thinking about it.

16:58.157 --> 16:59.435
I mean, I know I heard it before.

16:59.459 --> 17:00.803
I just couldn't place it.

17:00.827 --> 17:02.171
You know, Cookie, a lot of people

17:02.195 --> 17:03.339
do a lot of runs.

17:03.363 --> 17:06.075
Yeah, but that run in particular.

17:06.098 --> 17:07.476
Uh, only thing I could think of

17:07.500 --> 17:10.145
is a... is a track a decade back

17:10.169 --> 17:12.614
by a artist... Melvin Austin.

17:12.637 --> 17:14.817
Had a song, "Calling You."

17:14.840 --> 17:17.252
Yeah, well, it made sense, cause...

17:17.276 --> 17:20.189
the run, the same voice.

17:21.614 --> 17:24.593
Melvin. That was you, wasn't it?

17:24.617 --> 17:28.230
Melvin is a dead name.
Don't call me that.

17:28.253 --> 17:30.833
Wait, I... I didn't mean to offend.

17:30.857 --> 17:32.735
I'm sorry, I... I think
it's great that you...

17:34.127 --> 17:36.472
You look amazing, Mel... Melody.

17:36.496 --> 17:38.607
You know what?
All you Lyons are the same.

17:38.631 --> 17:40.142
I want nothing to do with you.

17:40.166 --> 17:43.979
You and your demon-ass
husband can go that way.

17:44.003 --> 17:45.147
Excuse me.

17:48.841 --> 17:50.591
Lucious.

17:54.176 --> 17:57.192
All I know is,

17:57.193 --> 17:59.471
it's about to be
a bunch of fake-ass Cookies

17:59.495 --> 18:01.507
running around in these streets.

18:01.531 --> 18:03.742
Oh, I wish separating was as easy

18:03.766 --> 18:06.045
as getting rid of some clothes.

18:06.069 --> 18:09.048
Yeah, you can't sort through
baggage of 30 years

18:09.072 --> 18:10.816
in an afternoon, sis.

18:14.243 --> 18:16.088
Things would be a lot easier

18:16.112 --> 18:19.358
if the drama that is Lucious
didn't follow me everywhere.

18:19.382 --> 18:20.926
What do you mean?

18:20.950 --> 18:22.895
There's this singer...

18:22.919 --> 18:26.198
actually, she's a producer now,
and she's the real deal.

18:26.222 --> 18:28.667
I know exactly what to do with her

18:28.691 --> 18:30.969
so the world can see it, right?

18:30.993 --> 18:35.074
But turns out, Tornado Lucious
wrecked her back in the day,

18:35.098 --> 18:37.876
and so she doesn't want
to have anything to do with me.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.878
You know more about
Lucious' wreckage than anyone.

18:39.902 --> 18:41.680
And you know what else?

18:41.704 --> 18:44.016
It's not like you
to give up that easily.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.918
Talk to her.

18:48.945 --> 18:51.523
- Is that your wedding ring?
- Yeah.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.758
- Hand it over.
- Eh!

18:52.782 --> 18:54.026
Cookie.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.594
It's mine.

18:55.618 --> 18:57.363
You ain't gon' do nothing
but pawn it anyway

18:57.387 --> 18:58.297
with your greedy ass.

18:58.321 --> 18:59.965
Or make some earrings.

18:59.989 --> 19:01.567
I was gon' make it into toe rings.

19:01.591 --> 19:02.601
- Oh!

19:02.625 --> 19:04.036
You crazy.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.305
You asked me about my soul.

19:06.329 --> 19:07.406
I did.

19:07.430 --> 19:08.712
Well...

19:10.066 --> 19:11.543
You can't see my soul

19:11.567 --> 19:13.817
unless you come
into a place like this.

19:15.071 --> 19:19.051
Now, my indie hustle might have

19:19.075 --> 19:21.453
made me a ghetto superstar
in Philadelphia,

19:21.477 --> 19:23.222
but it wasn't until I left Philly

19:23.246 --> 19:26.291
and came to New York
and I discovered this place

19:26.315 --> 19:28.293
that I found my real art.

19:28.317 --> 19:31.296
And, Moishe...

19:31.320 --> 19:34.099
Look what I brought you
a lifetime customer.

19:34.123 --> 19:36.635
- Lucious Lyon himself.
How are you, bro?

19:36.659 --> 19:38.470
Yana?

19:38.494 --> 19:40.639
Oh, my sweet.

19:40.663 --> 19:41.940
How long has it been?

19:41.964 --> 19:44.443
It's been forever. How are you?

19:44.467 --> 19:45.811
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:45.835 --> 19:46.979
How... how do you know
about this place?

19:47.003 --> 19:48.313
Yes.

19:48.337 --> 19:49.448
Oh, she practically lived here.

19:49.472 --> 19:50.783
St. Mary's up the street.

19:50.807 --> 19:52.217
I had chemo there for about a year.

19:52.241 --> 19:53.719
Instead of dwelling on my illness,

19:53.743 --> 19:55.621
I just used to write songs
about the people

19:55.645 --> 19:57.856
and how they were fulfilled
through music,

19:57.880 --> 19:59.925
- and here we are.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.660
It's good to see you doing well.

20:01.684 --> 20:04.963
- Good to see you.
- And you too, my friend.

20:04.987 --> 20:06.331
If you'll excuse me,

20:06.355 --> 20:07.933
I have a violin lesson in the back.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.369
- The place is yours.
- Thank you, brother.

20:10.393 --> 20:11.837
See ya.

20:11.861 --> 20:13.038
- Wow.

20:13.062 --> 20:14.506
Surprise.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.141
I always knew this place

20:16.165 --> 20:19.344
had this kind of electric
attraction to it, you know?

20:19.368 --> 20:22.347
Oh, my God, this place
inspired me so much.

20:22.371 --> 20:26.218
I literally just got rid of all
the materialism in my life

20:26.242 --> 20:29.021
and I just dedicated every day
to music.

20:29.045 --> 20:31.023
Tell me...

20:32.782 --> 20:36.628
What are the chances
that both you and I...

20:36.652 --> 20:39.865
would be inspired
by this incredible place?

20:41.224 --> 20:43.702
Well, there's no such thing

20:43.726 --> 20:46.438
as coincidence, Lucious.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.006
You and I found this place

20:48.030 --> 20:51.643
because you and I were destined
to find each other.

21:09.619 --> 21:12.064
- Give me one second, babe.
- Of course.

21:12.088 --> 21:13.565
- Oh, my gosh, how are you?
- Hey.

21:13.589 --> 21:16.201
- How's the service, brother?
- Hey.

21:16.225 --> 21:20.005
I have to say, my good brother,
you know how to apologize.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.907
Well, I appreciate that you
accepted the olive branch.

21:21.931 --> 21:23.609
I should have kept charity
and business separate.

21:23.633 --> 21:26.578
Bottom line, Prophetic: I respect you,

21:26.602 --> 21:28.347
I respect your spirit,
and from here on out,

21:28.371 --> 21:29.915
I remain strictly a fan.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.685
You and your queen
won't be joining us?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.554
Would if I could, brother,

21:35.578 --> 21:37.656
but, uh, there's a Lyon prince
who's gonna be pretty upset

21:37.680 --> 21:39.658
if his mom and dad get in
too late, right?

21:39.682 --> 21:40.993
Anyway, you enjoy yourself, all right?

21:41.017 --> 21:42.828
You already know.

21:42.852 --> 21:45.898
- Anything they want, they get.
- Yes, sir.

21:55.064 --> 21:58.343
Uh, Melody,
can I have a second, please?

21:58.367 --> 21:59.945
I'm working.

21:59.969 --> 22:01.880
Look, I had no right
to bring up the past

22:01.904 --> 22:03.982
or make any assumptions about you,

22:04.006 --> 22:06.724
and for that, I apologize.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.756
Well, that's more than
I ever got from your husband.

22:10.780 --> 22:13.725
I would never pretend to know
what my ex...

22:13.749 --> 22:16.261
what that man did to you.

22:16.285 --> 22:18.630
Hell, he threw my baby boy
in the trash can,

22:18.654 --> 22:20.499
so I can only imagine.

22:20.523 --> 22:22.439
I wish you the best, Melody.

22:23.492 --> 22:25.576
You're really a true talent.

22:26.829 --> 22:29.241
You know...

22:29.265 --> 22:31.677
most people in this business
wouldn't apologize.

22:31.701 --> 22:33.650
Well, I'm not most people.

22:35.605 --> 22:38.288
You know, you're more
than just an artist.

22:39.008 --> 22:40.452
You're a star, Melody,

22:40.476 --> 22:43.889
and you deserve to shine bright.

22:43.913 --> 22:45.290
Do I?

22:45.314 --> 22:47.292
Because shine for somebody like me

22:47.316 --> 22:49.294
means a life full of scrutiny,

22:49.318 --> 22:50.963
mockery, prejudice, and death threats.

22:50.987 --> 22:53.098
Yeah, you always gon'
have haters, honey.

22:55.324 --> 22:57.903
But, uh...

22:57.927 --> 23:00.973
what I can see is that
you've been living your truth.

23:00.997 --> 23:03.709
But performing
is also a part of that truth.

23:03.733 --> 23:05.877
It's who you are.

23:05.901 --> 23:08.719
That's easy to say
from the sidelines, Cookie.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.516
Close your eyes.

23:11.540 --> 23:12.884
What?

23:12.908 --> 23:14.686
Trust me. Close your eyes.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.160
Come on.

23:19.515 --> 23:22.361
Just imagine yourself
onstage with Lala.

23:22.385 --> 23:25.197
And I mean, Lala is on fire,

23:25.221 --> 23:28.166
and all that magic and energy...
you feel it?

23:28.190 --> 23:30.307
Yeah, I do.

23:31.027 --> 23:33.705
Well, how does it feel
to hear her do your run

23:33.729 --> 23:35.841
and you sing background?

23:38.067 --> 23:40.545
All I need is one song.

23:40.569 --> 23:42.314
One song to prove to you

23:42.338 --> 23:45.784
that you belong on that stage.

23:45.808 --> 23:48.387
There is this one song I wrote.

23:48.411 --> 23:50.989
I was still on Empire, but...

23:51.013 --> 23:52.724
Lucious never let me perform it.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.795
It was meant to be my...

23:56.819 --> 23:59.464
Your debut?

23:59.488 --> 24:01.633
My birth.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.502
That's it. That's the song.

24:03.526 --> 24:04.676
Let me hear it.

24:06.395 --> 24:07.711
Come on.

25:07.962 --> 25:11.141
I swear, I could
listen to you sing forever.

25:11.165 --> 25:13.177
Well, you only have tonight.

25:13.201 --> 25:14.678
That's our deal.

25:14.702 --> 25:17.314
All right, then let's
keep this date going.

25:17.338 --> 25:19.149
Great. Where to next?

25:37.792 --> 25:39.336
Chastity!

25:39.360 --> 25:41.472
Chastity!

25:41.496 --> 25:43.006
Chastity!

25:43.030 --> 25:45.075
Where the hell are you?

25:45.099 --> 25:46.577
- Chastity!
Hey.

25:48.436 --> 25:49.913
Chastity!
- Oh, my God!

25:49.937 --> 25:52.116
She's 15!

25:52.140 --> 25:53.484
- What?
- Let's go, Chastity!

25:53.508 --> 25:54.685
Dad, stop!
- Damn pedophile!

25:54.709 --> 25:56.186
Stop it, Dad!

25:56.210 --> 25:57.421
Chastity, let's go! Come on!

25:57.445 --> 25:58.856
Oh, my God, Dad.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.324
We're not... we're not done
with this, man!

26:00.348 --> 26:02.693
You little pervert, this is not over!

26:08.856 --> 26:10.139
I'm getting this.

26:12.860 --> 26:14.376
This right here...

26:16.664 --> 26:18.475
- This is it.
- Wow.

26:18.499 --> 26:22.212
Now, keep in mind, I signed
my very first artist...

26:24.071 --> 26:26.817
On a paper plate and a handshake.

26:26.841 --> 26:28.252
What?

26:28.276 --> 26:29.720
And then after that,

26:29.744 --> 26:31.555
all these artists kept coming, and...

26:31.579 --> 26:33.524
next thing you know,
I gain this reputation

26:33.548 --> 26:36.727
as this hit maker,
and, um, the single man

26:36.751 --> 26:38.729
became a global empire.

26:38.753 --> 26:40.130
Wow.

26:40.154 --> 26:41.665
Okay, and so...
so where does Cookie fit

26:41.689 --> 26:43.038
into the whole story?

26:43.858 --> 26:47.804
Well, back in the day, I mean,
she was my ride or die.

26:47.828 --> 26:49.907
- Yeah?

26:49.931 --> 26:52.743
But then she got locked up

26:52.767 --> 26:55.012
and, um...

26:55.036 --> 26:59.216
I had to choose between
quitting or keep building,

26:59.240 --> 27:01.685
and I just couldn't put
that hammer down, you know?

27:01.709 --> 27:04.755
So now, is it true that she
went to prison for you?

27:04.779 --> 27:08.025
We was both in the dope game
and she just got caught.

27:08.049 --> 27:09.927
And you let her get caught?

27:09.951 --> 27:12.634
Cookie gon' do what Cookie gon' do.

27:13.454 --> 27:15.032
- Hmm.

27:15.056 --> 27:17.434
This place...

27:17.458 --> 27:19.736
there's a... a spiritual energy.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.238
It's very real here.

27:21.262 --> 27:23.207
See, I knew you was gon' get it.

27:23.231 --> 27:26.243
But there's also a heaviness here.

27:27.969 --> 27:30.747
I don't know, I feel, like,
a dark, malevolent energy

27:30.771 --> 27:32.216
manifested in these walls.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.284
That's that yin and yang.

27:34.308 --> 27:36.158
It's necessary for balance.

27:37.078 --> 27:40.324
I was born into a dark world,

27:40.348 --> 27:41.992
but from that darkness,

27:42.016 --> 27:45.929
I managed to harness it...

27:45.953 --> 27:48.699
and grow into this living light,

27:48.723 --> 27:51.235
this beautiful light.

27:51.259 --> 27:53.570
You know, you don't need dark
to have light.

27:53.594 --> 27:55.239
That's a myth.

27:55.263 --> 27:58.542
So without Empire,
I wouldn't have this light...

28:00.301 --> 28:02.212
Which is you.

28:14.682 --> 28:17.099
She told me she was 22.

28:19.220 --> 28:20.631
My life is over.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.933
I need you to trust me.

28:22.957 --> 28:25.535
Take a breath.
It's being taken care of.

28:25.559 --> 28:27.676
This whole situation is gonna go away.

28:28.529 --> 28:29.873
But how did you...

28:32.700 --> 28:34.516
My God.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.186
Thank you, Andre.

28:38.139 --> 28:40.289
I don't know what to say.

28:41.809 --> 28:43.625
It's what friends do.

28:44.812 --> 28:47.090
All right? Have a drink.

29:25.086 --> 29:27.998
Lucious, you need
to call me back ASAP.

29:28.022 --> 29:30.334
I have something
you need to hear... now.

29:45.481 --> 29:46.925
Hi, Sheila.

29:46.949 --> 29:51.529
Girl, Sarah just sent me
a check for $100,000.

29:51.553 --> 29:55.800
Okay, why is your college
frenemy sending you money?

29:55.824 --> 29:59.337
Well, uh, I sent her $10,000
from our business account

29:59.361 --> 30:02.006
because, uh, she had an IPO

30:02.030 --> 30:03.475
and I wanted to test the waters.

30:03.499 --> 30:06.010
And then bam.

30:06.034 --> 30:07.479
She turned that into 100 Gs.

30:07.503 --> 30:09.848
How dare you do that
without telling me?

30:09.872 --> 30:11.516
You know that that... Wait.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.318
100% return is not bad.

30:13.342 --> 30:16.020
Bitch, it's 1,000%,

30:16.044 --> 30:18.256
which is why...

30:18.280 --> 30:20.892
I want to go all in for the 2 mil.

30:20.916 --> 30:23.709
If we get in now, the two becomes ten

30:23.710 --> 30:25.421
and we have all the money we need.

30:25.445 --> 30:28.190
Yeah, I'm sure she told you

30:28.214 --> 30:30.559
it was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

30:30.583 --> 30:31.961
and that you have to act now,

30:31.985 --> 30:33.396
that she's a Nigerian prince...

30:33.420 --> 30:34.530
Very funny.

30:34.554 --> 30:36.198
Look, Sarah's not a scammer.

30:36.222 --> 30:39.273
She's my friend,
and the check cleared.

30:41.294 --> 30:42.538
- Bam.
- Okay.

30:42.562 --> 30:44.373
Giselle, first of all,

30:44.397 --> 30:47.810
I believe you called her
a frenemy, okay?

30:47.834 --> 30:50.246
What if she's some financial catfisher

30:50.270 --> 30:51.447
and you're about to get got?

30:51.471 --> 30:52.581
- You gotta be careful.
- No, no.

30:52.605 --> 30:54.183
You need to trust me on this.

30:54.207 --> 30:57.053
This is the solve to all our problems.

30:59.746 --> 31:01.724
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:01.748 --> 31:03.192
Fine, invest it.

31:03.216 --> 31:05.294
But...

31:05.318 --> 31:07.963
girl, I pray that you are right

31:07.987 --> 31:09.565
and that my instincts are wrong,

31:09.589 --> 31:13.035
but if they are not,
then Bossy is done.

31:14.661 --> 31:15.971
Okay.

31:32.278 --> 31:33.823
Oh, hi, sweetie.

31:36.483 --> 31:38.027
Spectacular performances. Thank you.

31:38.051 --> 31:40.463
Oh, hey, I'm happy for the gig.

31:40.487 --> 31:43.332
The legit ones are few
and far between these days.

31:43.356 --> 31:45.267
Try telling my agent
that I can play 15

31:45.291 --> 31:46.769
and he'd laugh you out of the room.

31:46.793 --> 31:48.137
Ah.

31:48.161 --> 31:50.206
Right this way. I'll show you out.

31:50.230 --> 31:51.841
Thank you again.

31:57.437 --> 32:00.750
A regular Machiavelli, truly.

32:00.774 --> 32:04.453
That was a move
right out of Lucious' book.

32:04.477 --> 32:06.021
Ah, no, brother.

32:06.045 --> 32:08.491
Lucious would have
blackmailed Prophetic

32:08.515 --> 32:10.326
and create an enemy.

32:11.851 --> 32:14.697
I signed a new artist
and made a friend.

32:14.721 --> 32:18.501
One who owes me
for the rest of his life.

32:40.580 --> 32:42.158
Oh, hell no.

32:42.182 --> 32:44.326
You just gon' up and leave
like that, huh?

32:44.350 --> 32:45.995
I have a few meetings

32:46.019 --> 32:47.401
before my flight tonight.

32:48.254 --> 32:51.000
Lucious, our time...

32:51.024 --> 32:52.668
was magical.

32:52.692 --> 32:54.403
I'm really grateful to you

32:54.427 --> 32:57.039
for allowing me into your heart

32:57.063 --> 32:58.579
and into your world.

33:00.767 --> 33:02.878
But it's even more clear to me now

33:02.902 --> 33:04.880
this is where you belong,

33:04.904 --> 33:06.916
not me.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.524
Take care of yourself.

33:39.606 --> 33:41.484
All right, Cook.

33:41.508 --> 33:43.719
What's all this that you got me
rushing down here for?

33:43.743 --> 33:45.554
Sit down, shut up, and listen.

33:45.578 --> 33:47.056
Well, if it's gon' be like that,

33:47.080 --> 33:48.123
then I'll just
get the hell out of here.

33:48.147 --> 33:49.925
Look, let me reintroduce you

33:49.949 --> 33:51.660
to someone you know very well.

33:51.684 --> 33:52.795
Have a seat.

33:52.819 --> 33:54.468
After you.

34:50.710 --> 34:52.021
Look, I don't care.

34:52.045 --> 34:53.155
Just have him tell another joke.

34:53.179 --> 34:54.156
I'm getting him now.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.724
Hey, Mel, we're on in...

34:57.417 --> 35:00.329
This some weird-ass Halloween joke?

35:00.353 --> 35:02.131
Lucious, I need to tell you something.

35:14.467 --> 35:16.445
Wait, wait.
What... what are you doing, huh?

35:16.469 --> 35:17.780
What... what are you doing?

35:17.804 --> 35:20.115
My name is Melody.

35:22.475 --> 35:24.520
This is the face that I wear

35:24.544 --> 35:26.455
and this is the body that I live in.

35:26.479 --> 35:28.324
Tonight I'm gonna sing a new song,

35:28.348 --> 35:30.225
one that addresses my transition.

35:30.249 --> 35:31.660
Shut the hell up!

35:31.684 --> 35:33.262
You're Melvin.

35:45.732 --> 35:48.410
Now, you need to get out
of that ridiculous costume.

35:48.434 --> 35:50.245
- Get on that stage.
- No, I won't.

35:50.269 --> 35:53.549
I poured $1.2 million

35:53.573 --> 35:55.517
into Melvin, a man.

35:55.541 --> 35:57.720
You signed the contract as Melvin.

35:57.744 --> 35:58.954
You don't own me, Lucious.

35:58.978 --> 36:00.823
No, I don't, but Empire does.

36:08.287 --> 36:11.667
You need to pay the $1.2 million back

36:11.691 --> 36:12.835
with interest,

36:12.859 --> 36:14.370
or you won't perform here

36:14.394 --> 36:15.904
or on any damn stage.

36:15.928 --> 36:18.374
Take the damn dress off,
put on your pants,

36:18.398 --> 36:20.843
get out there as Melvin,
or it's a rifle in your ass.

36:30.376 --> 36:32.321
Yes.

36:33.646 --> 36:35.958
This is who I am.

36:35.982 --> 36:38.794
This is who I am.

36:38.818 --> 36:40.496
You know what?

36:40.520 --> 36:42.765
Do what you gotta do.

36:42.789 --> 36:44.133
I'm done.

36:59.005 --> 37:00.654
Whoo!

37:18.324 --> 37:20.102
Here's your ring.

37:20.126 --> 37:23.338
That should cover
the $1.2 million for Melody.

37:39.679 --> 37:42.124
I made a terrible mistake...

37:42.148 --> 37:44.198
many years ago.

37:45.351 --> 37:47.663
I wasn't sensitive enough at the time

37:47.687 --> 37:50.404
to see you for who you really are.

37:51.491 --> 37:53.902
The song you sang was absolutely...

37:53.926 --> 37:56.205
it was beautiful.

37:58.498 --> 38:01.477
And Cookie will be the right person

38:01.501 --> 38:04.947
to help guide you along your journey.

38:04.971 --> 38:06.715
Best of luck.

38:29.061 --> 38:32.046
That was amazing.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.470
And it didn't work,
so just scrap the whole thing.

38:38.471 --> 38:40.088
There she go!

38:41.141 --> 38:43.286
- Let me call you back.
- There go my boo.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.021
- Girl...
- What's going on, Becky?

38:45.045 --> 38:47.590
Okay, you deserve all the love.

38:47.614 --> 38:49.659
- What do you mean?
- All the hugs, all the praise.

38:49.683 --> 38:52.361
I have been stalking our stock
all morning.

38:52.385 --> 38:53.863
- We...
- Oh, no.

38:53.887 --> 38:56.365
Are now $10 million richer.

38:56.389 --> 38:57.800
Bitch, we did it!

38:57.824 --> 39:01.137
- $10 million!
- Oh, my God.

39:01.161 --> 39:02.171
I know!

39:02.195 --> 39:04.674
Ten whole million dollars!

39:04.698 --> 39:06.976
Girl, I should have never doubted you

39:07.000 --> 39:08.945
or our best friend!

39:08.969 --> 39:10.913
Becky, I've got
something I have to tell you.

39:10.937 --> 39:13.115
- Also, just so you know...
- I...

39:13.139 --> 39:16.752
I went and ahead and committed
to eight ASA nomination spots.

39:16.776 --> 39:19.956
Eight of them, okay?
Are they ready for us?

39:21.481 --> 39:24.201
- Oh...
- Happy tears, right?

39:24.202 --> 39:25.679
I didn't invest the money.

39:27.171 --> 39:29.349
I didn't invest the money.

39:31.642 --> 39:34.621
- Do not play with me.
- I'm not playing, Becky!

39:34.645 --> 39:37.991
I... you brought up
all these valid concerns!

39:38.015 --> 39:40.060
And you gave me the face, the finger!

39:40.084 --> 39:42.229
- I...
- This finger?

39:42.253 --> 39:43.997
Didn't want to let you down,

39:44.021 --> 39:45.699
and so I didn't go through with it.

39:45.723 --> 39:48.202
You don't wanna let me down,
so now's the time

39:48.226 --> 39:50.337
when you chose to listen to me, right?

39:50.361 --> 39:52.439
Now?

40:21.192 --> 40:25.239
Are you gonna tell me
what we're doing here?

40:25.263 --> 40:28.008
Well, um, I haven't been

40:28.032 --> 40:30.110
completely honest with you
these past few days, Teri.

40:30.134 --> 40:31.445
Andre, you're scaring me.

40:31.469 --> 40:33.046
Close your eyes.

40:34.572 --> 40:37.785
Take a breath and trust me.

40:37.809 --> 40:39.258
Close your eyes.

40:40.478 --> 40:41.922
Uh-huh.

40:41.946 --> 40:43.223
Sweet. Come on.

40:43.247 --> 40:45.831
Yana. Yana!

40:46.484 --> 40:48.962
- Lucious, what are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

40:48.986 --> 40:50.097
- All right.
- I got you.

40:50.121 --> 40:51.431
- Okay.
- All right,

40:51.455 --> 40:52.800
last step right here.

40:52.824 --> 40:53.901
All right, I'm opening a door.

40:53.925 --> 40:55.435
Okay, you're opening...

40:55.459 --> 40:56.770
- We're gonna walk through it.

40:56.794 --> 40:58.939
Lucious, listen, I had a great time,

40:58.963 --> 41:00.474
but I have to go.

41:00.498 --> 41:01.575
No, you don't have to go.

41:01.599 --> 41:02.810
- I do.
- You can stay.

41:02.834 --> 41:04.578
Open them.

41:10.341 --> 41:12.820
I keep my promises.

41:12.844 --> 41:15.828
I'm gonna give my wife
the wedding of her dreams.

41:16.681 --> 41:18.625
I felt that energy at Empire, Lucious,

41:18.649 --> 41:20.661
and if I'm being
completely honest with you,

41:20.685 --> 41:22.396
it scared me.

41:26.591 --> 41:28.335
What in the world are you doing?

41:28.359 --> 41:31.972
I am going to do this the right way.

41:34.198 --> 41:35.776
You gotta at least give us a try.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.144
You gotta try.

41:37.168 --> 41:39.313
You're the only light I see

41:39.337 --> 41:41.014
in this darkness.

41:41.038 --> 41:44.223
Teri, my light in the darkness...

41:45.476 --> 41:47.654
Will you do me the honor
of being my wife?

41:50.381 --> 41:52.659
Yes.

41:52.683 --> 41:53.861
Yes.

41:53.885 --> 41:56.063
I need the truth from you.

41:56.087 --> 41:57.798
Do you hear me? The truth.

41:57.822 --> 41:59.333
Always.

41:59.357 --> 42:01.006
You want the truth?

42:02.326 --> 42:04.209
The truth is, I need you.

42:05.997 --> 42:07.546
I need you.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.677
Okay.

42:21.412 --> 42:23.062
Come on in.

42:27.551 --> 42:29.835
You think Lucious is your hero?

42:30.888 --> 42:32.366
Well, he's not.

42:32.390 --> 42:36.570
He owes you... everything.

42:38.596 --> 42:41.808
And now we're gonna make him pay.
