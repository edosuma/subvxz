I'd like to call to order
this secret conclave

01:20.147 --> 01:22.181
of America's media empires.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.215
We are here to come up with

01:23.217 --> 01:24.683
the next phony
baloney crisis

01:24.685 --> 01:26.452
to put Americans back
where they belong--

01:26.454 --> 01:28.587
in dark rooms,
glued to their televisions,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.489
too terrified to skip
the commercials.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.958
Well, I think...
NBC, you are here

01:32.960 --> 01:34.960
to listen and not speak!

01:35.029 --> 01:37.162
I think we should go with
a good old-fashioned

01:37.164 --> 01:38.063
public health scare.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.264
(murmuring)

01:39.266 --> 01:41.133
A new disease!
No one's immune!

01:41.135 --> 01:42.201
It's like the summer

01:42.203 --> 01:44.336
except instead of a shark,
it's an epidemic...

01:44.338 --> 01:46.305
and instead of summer,
it's all the time!

01:46.307 --> 01:47.673
(agreeing murmurs)
MAN:
That is smokin'!

01:47.675 --> 01:49.708
Now I hate to be
the guy who derails

01:49.710 --> 01:51.210
what everybody else loves...

01:51.212 --> 01:52.678
He loves being that guy.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.414
But, Janice,
we do have standards.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.549
This can't be
a made-up disease.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.817
The only moral thing to do

01:58.819 --> 02:01.620
is release a deadly virus
into the general public.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.323
We do have something
we've been holding onto,

02:04.325 --> 02:05.891
but it hasn't been tested.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.391
Get over here, NBC.

02:06.393 --> 02:10.829
(chuckling) Well, we certainly
believe in testing,

02:10.831 --> 02:13.265
but I... Oh!
(woozy moan)

02:13.267 --> 02:14.833
(struggling breaths)

02:14.835 --> 02:16.869
Wow. Wow!
Oh, yeah!

02:16.871 --> 02:18.871
So, we've got
our deadly disease.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.607
Now we just have to
blame it on something

02:21.609 --> 02:23.242
that's in every household...

02:23.244 --> 02:26.445
something that people are a
little bit afraid of already.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.680
Housecat Flu is coming, people!

02:28.682 --> 02:31.016
The Center for Disease
Disinformation predicts

02:31.018 --> 02:31.717
with some degree of probability

02:31.719 --> 02:35.187
that the Housecat Flu might
spread in the following

02:35.189 --> 02:36.822
hypothetical outbreak pattern.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.723
(congested coughing)

02:37.725 --> 02:41.426

following symptoms:

02:54.642 --> 02:58.577
mild thirst, occasional hunger,
tiredness at night...

02:58.579 --> 02:59.044
(clamoring voices)

02:59.046 --> 03:03.482

03:05.953 --> 03:08.720
(meowing)

03:12.293 --> 03:12.758
Hurry up, boy!

03:12.760 --> 03:15.227
We have to burn
everything the cat touched,

03:15.229 --> 03:18.564
before the virus
makes us paranoid!

03:22.436 --> 03:23.769
Homer!

03:23.771 --> 03:26.338
Stop burning!

03:26.674 --> 03:29.007

We'll get the vaccine.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.282
Homer, did you know
he was in the pile?

03:37.284 --> 03:40.252
I thought he was
an old clump of rags.

03:40.254 --> 03:43.388

03:43.390 --> 03:44.423
Don't worry, people.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.858

vaccines for...

03:46.860 --> 03:48.427
one child per family.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.696

(tires screeching)
(thudding)

04:32.706 --> 04:36.275
Yes, I'd like 37 snifters
of your influenza syrup.

04:36.277 --> 04:40.412
One for me, one for Smithers
here and the rest for my hounds.

04:40.414 --> 04:44.283
Give him what he wants. He's the
only taxpayer in this town.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.319
But Mr. Mayor, these people
have waited in line.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.954
And dogs can't even
get the disease.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.723
They'll see me take it
and they'll want some.

04:51.725 --> 04:55.527
Yes 'oo will. Yes 'oo will,
you little jelly belly.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.596
Sir, perhaps we should
get out of here,

04:57.598 --> 05:00.299
before people start
resenting you.

05:00.601 --> 05:04.770
Hooh! Hurry up and get in!
I'll drive.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.698
I feel as hail
and hearty as an eohippus.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.635
Eh, Mr. Burns, I did a little
blood work earlier today

05:36.637 --> 05:39.838
and I'm afraid I've got
a bit of hard news.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.441
Spit it out, Doctor!
I haven't got all day.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.709
Eh, you certainly don't.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.345
You see, I'm
afraid you're dying.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.713
(gasping)
Dying?!

05:47.715 --> 05:50.382
Yes. It's a number
of factors, really:

05:50.384 --> 05:53.518
whooping cough, hectic fever,
cancrum otis,

05:53.520 --> 05:59.391
Wellington's ooze, the Lambeth
plague, and skull collapse.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.393
How long do I have?

06:01.395 --> 06:03.895
Five, six weeks tops.

06:03.897 --> 06:04.930
You might live to see

06:04.932 --> 06:07.966

to Swinton Park.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.403
(hard swallow)

06:11.405 --> 06:13.872
You... want me to tell
the employees, sir?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.475
No. It's better that
they hear it from me.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.545
I'll tell them the truth
in the simplest way I know how.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.014
(lively music plays)

06:33.026 --> 06:35.660
Aw, why did Burns
make us all come here?

06:35.662 --> 06:37.396
I bet he's got something
up his sleeve.

06:37.398 --> 06:41.366
I don't like that he hired
a band to play ominous music.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.769
(slow jazz playing)

06:47.408 --> 06:49.141

06:49.143 --> 06:53.445

news for all of you.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.713
(grumbling, murmurs)

06:54.715 --> 06:57.449
Or maybe he's going to
jack up our electric rates.

06:57.451 --> 07:01.553
Whew! I will have to
hand-crank my wiener warmer.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.856
Hand-crank my wiener warmer!

07:04.858 --> 07:07.793
The truth is...
I'm dying.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.661
Hell, yeah!

07:09.663 --> 07:11.763
Finally, a break
for the black man!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.131

die soon anyway!

very powerful temporary enemy!

rile them up.

change your tune

I'm leaving behind me.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.197
I'm leaving all my money

07:45.199 --> 07:49.835

"me"-shaped fruits.

(sighs)
Oh, a lot like my old boss.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.690
Ruthless.
Went to Yale.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.258
Made a fortune in energy.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.427
Basically hairless.
Oh, yeah.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.729
He likes to stack men naked.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.698
I guess that's a start.

11:42.002 --> 11:46.438
A philanthropist, a
humanitarian, a man of peace...

11:46.440 --> 11:48.873
these are among the people
who've come today

11:48.875 --> 11:52.277
to spit in Montgomery Burns'
open grave.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.847
The fact that Burns'
37-pound body was never found

11:55.849 --> 11:59.117
did nothing to lessen the
salivary salvos.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.986
(gathering spit)
Hold, please.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.255
You may continue.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.459
I hope they use that spit
for a good cause,

12:07.461 --> 12:09.227
like sealing
wedding envelopes.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.464
Or helping a railroad worker
grip his sledgehammer!

12:12.466 --> 12:15.066
Now they're dancing
on his grave!

12:15.068 --> 12:16.267
Dance, you sons of bitches!

12:16.269 --> 12:18.369
Dance like it's me down there!
(spits)

12:18.371 --> 12:21.873
Thank God Mr. Burns
isn't alive to see this.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.807
BART:
Come back!

12:22.809 --> 12:25.944
I'm not finished
giving you your bath!

12:25.946 --> 12:26.945
(grunts)

12:26.947 --> 12:28.146
(gasping)

12:29.483 --> 12:31.282
(grunting)

12:37.791 --> 12:41.459
DOLL:
Attack during their
sacred holiday!

12:41.962 --> 12:45.196
Hmm, apparently Mr. Burns
is in a state of shock

12:45.198 --> 12:46.965
from the trauma
he underwent.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.433
Oh man, this is great!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.935
The most evil man in town
is in our power.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.971
(evil laughter)

12:52.973 --> 12:55.173
He will do my bidding...

12:55.175 --> 12:56.775
at that fantasy football
auction.

12:56.777 --> 13:02.080
And anything else my limited
imagination can come up with.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.950
(sadistic laughter)

13:09.089 --> 13:10.955
Just because Mr. Burns
was mean to you,

13:10.957 --> 13:14.826
that doesn't give you the right
to abuse him when he's helpless.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.828
Marge, it's the golden rule:

13:16.830 --> 13:19.931
treat others the way
they mess with you.

13:19.933 --> 13:20.965
It's not up to you.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.802
We're going to take him
to our moral and civic leaders.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.403
They'll know
the right thing to do.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.206
All those in favor
of treating Mr. Burns

13:28.208 --> 13:30.408
the way he messed
with us, say "aye."

13:30.410 --> 13:33.311
CROWD:
Aye!
People of Springfield!

13:33.313 --> 13:34.546
To quote Shakespeare,

13:34.548 --> 13:38.082
"The quality of mercy
is not strained."

13:38.084 --> 13:38.850
CROWD:
Boo!

13:38.852 --> 13:39.818
You know, it takes a lot

13:39.820 --> 13:43.188
for an eight-year-old to stand
up in front of the whole town!

13:43.190 --> 13:46.391
Eight-year-old? I always
thought you were a midget!

13:46.393 --> 13:50.528
We're called "little people,"
and I'm not one.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.530
People of Springfield,
as a nerd,

13:52.532 --> 13:56.000
I understand your desire
for revenge,

13:56.002 --> 13:57.936
but this sweet, harmless man

13:57.938 --> 14:02.874
is not the same remorseless
monster who tormented us all.

14:02.876 --> 14:03.908
He's close enough!

14:03.910 --> 14:05.877
Yeah, Seaside Heights
ain't Maui,

14:05.879 --> 14:09.080
but, uh, you take
what you can get. Whoa!

14:09.082 --> 14:10.281
(groans)

14:10.283 --> 14:12.183
(chittering)

14:12.185 --> 14:13.885
(zapping)

14:13.887 --> 14:16.454
You done pullin' the wings
off of those bees?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.423
Almost, Mr. Vice President.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.825
May I ask why I'm doing this?

14:20.827 --> 14:22.427
I don't know.
I'm bored.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.462
When my old boss got bored,
he liked to listen

14:24.464 --> 14:27.599
to Thomas Edison reciting
"Mary Had a Little Lamb"

14:27.601 --> 14:28.399
on a wax cylinder.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.935
What do you think I am,
1,000 years old?

14:30.937 --> 14:34.439
I got a myPod
full of Lee Greenwood.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.342
(hums)

14:37.344 --> 14:38.977
(snores)

14:40.347 --> 14:42.614
Now boy, everyone
in town gets Burns

14:42.616 --> 14:44.616
for half an hour
to do as they will.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.986
This town can't teach its kids
or collect its garbage,

14:47.988 --> 14:51.322
but we lead the nation in
pointless revenge.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.857
Amen.

14:52.859 --> 14:53.458
(squeals delightedly)

14:53.460 --> 14:57.428
Okay, Burnsie,
follow the carrot.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.645
Dad, you're gonna wreck him
for everybody.

15:13.647 --> 15:17.282
Don't worry, boy.
Another girder
always swings in

15:17.284 --> 15:21.619
for you to walk on right
when you get to the end.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.655
(moans)

15:23.657 --> 15:25.323
Where's the other girder?

15:25.325 --> 15:26.457
Ow!

15:26.559 --> 15:31.396
Okay, here's your choice--
cash in my hands
or blood on the jerky.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.632
I believe you want
the assistant manager, sir.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.335
Oh, I can't shoot him.
I've got him next.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.238
Well, that is your bad luck,
because he is mine right now.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.974
Come back in half an hour.
He can be your accomplice.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.176
I was going to take him
ice skating.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.644
What was that?
Nothing.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.413
What was that?
Ice skating?

15:48.415 --> 15:52.684
Do you do axels and Salchows?
What do you do?

15:52.686 --> 15:53.952
(groans)

15:55.155 --> 15:57.155
Check out my new dad.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.457
Sorry, lame-o.
It's 2:00.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.459
Which makes him
my Uncle Ed for an hour.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.530
No. It's Saturday,
which makes him that guy
at the youth center

16:05.532 --> 16:06.364
who really believes in me.

16:06.366 --> 16:10.234
There's still time
for me to turn
my life around, right?

16:11.071 --> 16:14.138
It's not that easy, man.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.740
(crying)

16:15.742 --> 16:17.508
(doorbell rings)

16:18.611 --> 16:19.544
All yours.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.611
What did you do with him?

16:20.613 --> 16:24.215
Found a way
to use him as a bong.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.150
(coughs)

16:26.152 --> 16:27.652
(moans)

16:28.755 --> 16:29.220
(Lisa groans)

16:29.222 --> 16:32.256
Dad, Mr. Burns is here
for you again.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.624
Oh, already?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.960
A little tired
of revenge, are we?

16:35.962 --> 16:40.064
Yeah. I've done all I can do
in that medium.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.600
All right. Mr. Burns,
I'm going to show you

16:42.602 --> 16:46.571
that not all of us in this town
are vindictive and cruel.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.572
(shotgun cocking)

16:47.574 --> 16:49.407
Not today.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.313
I thought after all
you went through

16:55.315 --> 17:00.151
you'd just might want to spend
an hour in a place
where you felt at home.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.452
Lots of room for friends.

17:01.454 --> 17:05.623
Actually, sir, the man
who lived here didn't have
many friends.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.193
But you're a better person
than he ever was.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.529
(humming)

17:11.531 --> 17:13.031
(gasps)

17:13.400 --> 17:14.432
That's me.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.336
Yes. Technically, it's you.
But like I said,
people change...

17:18.338 --> 17:21.773
And they can also
bloody well change back.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.341
Eep.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.478
Daddy's home.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.682
(sighs vibrate)

17:36.222 --> 17:38.056
Don't have time
for the paper, Smithers.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.125
Any terrorist attacks
on American soil today?

17:41.127 --> 17:43.127
I'm sorry, but no.

17:43.129 --> 17:43.694
Oh...

17:43.696 --> 17:48.299
Smithers, trading me in
for a younger model, I see.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.767
Mr. Burns, you're alive!

17:49.769 --> 17:51.836
I'm so happy,
I could... hug you.

17:51.838 --> 17:56.307
(scoffs):
And me smell like drugstore
cologne the rest of the day?

17:56.309 --> 17:57.341
I don't think so.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.544
You may hug my shadow.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.678
Oh!

18:00.680 --> 18:03.081
Oh!
(clears throat)

18:03.083 --> 18:04.315
Oh, Mr. Vice President.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.386
I've loved this time we've spent
in this dormant volcano, but...

18:08.388 --> 18:10.221
You're leaving me,
aren't you?

18:10.223 --> 18:10.555
I-I am.

18:10.557 --> 18:15.593
You realize that every time
I don't get what I want
Al Qaeda wins.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.428
Can I go now?
Yes.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.299
I just need
to erase your memory.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.867
(moaning)

18:22.869 --> 18:24.635
(moaning)

18:26.372 --> 18:27.271
(helicopter approaches)

18:27.273 --> 18:28.473
BURNS:
Attention, insects.

18:28.475 --> 18:32.110
The foot of reckoning
has arrived.

18:32.245 --> 18:37.281
Hey there, Mr. Burns.
For our half hour, I thought
we'd have a picnic in the park.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.516
Silence, you sadistic monster.

18:38.518 --> 18:43.287
I've got my memory back,
and I'm going to wreak
a terrible vengeance.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.590
Taking an idea I got
from a Stephen King book,

18:45.592 --> 18:49.260
I'm going to cover this town
with a dome!

18:49.262 --> 18:51.429
(laughs wickedly)

18:53.133 --> 18:54.432
It's been done.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.235
Really? You don't say.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.404
Did you know about this?
Mm-hmm.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.672
I see.

19:05.044 --> 19:11.182
Well, what if I cover you all
with a cube
of bulletproof Plexiglas?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.317
Uh, it's pretty much
the same thing.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.219
Plus, we could always
dig ourselves out,

19:15.221 --> 19:18.189
although that never seems
to occur to anybody.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.259
Set her down, Smithers.

19:22.195 --> 19:26.664
Mr. Burns, you can't hurt us
after all we've done for you.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.266
What the devil
are you talking about?

19:28.268 --> 19:32.737
You were given
six weeks to live,
and you've outlived it.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.505
I think what kept you alive

19:34.507 --> 19:40.745
was that for once in your life
you were helping other people.

19:40.747 --> 19:41.913
Could it be?

19:41.915 --> 19:44.715
Perhaps kindness
did keep me alive.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.785
Young man, would you like
a lemon drop?

19:47.787 --> 19:49.487
Mmm!
(gasping)

19:49.489 --> 19:50.588
Gah!

19:54.260 --> 19:56.827
(crying)

19:57.897 --> 20:01.866
It wasn't kindness
that was keeping me alive.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.402
It was bile building up inside.

20:04.404 --> 20:08.472
Loathing is my life blood
and rage my royal jelly.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.708
So, yes, thank you, Springfield,

20:10.710 --> 20:13.578
for giving me the secret
to eternal life--

20:13.580 --> 20:14.445
hate!

20:14.447 --> 20:17.348
You're welcome.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.385
What are you doing here?

20:21.387 --> 20:23.354
You were my father
for two hours,

20:23.356 --> 20:25.923
and I'm not letting
this dad get away.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.694
Oh, preposterous!
I won't be Bismarcked
into fathering anyone.

20:29.696 --> 20:33.531
Listen, old man.
I need someone to cheer me on
in the school play,

20:33.533 --> 20:39.270
and it's gonna be you,
or this copter's going down.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.871
You know I'll do it.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.640
(man coughs)

20:42.642 --> 20:46.877
Thank God your son can't see
the way you're behaving.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.647
My son? My son?

20:49.649 --> 20:53.584
The truth is
I don't have a son!

20:53.586 --> 20:54.719
Ha ha!

20:54.721 --> 20:57.321
(sadder):
Ha ha.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.690
Ha... ha.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.627
That's my boy.

21:48.675 --> 21:49.940
Shh.
