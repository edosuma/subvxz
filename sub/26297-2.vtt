00:01.469 --> 00:03.304
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
there was nothing my mom loved

00:03.371 --> 00:05.839
more than cooking her way
into her family's heart,

00:05.906 --> 00:08.076
from her ooey, gooey
potato casserole

00:08.142 --> 00:09.577
to whatever this thing is.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.612
But her signature move
was the art of Parming,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.914
featuring her
legendary dish of choice.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.549
Shrimp Parm.
Shrimp Parm.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.385
Shrimp Parm.
Shrimp Parm.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.288
Unlike my mom,
Barry and his fiancee, Lainey,

00:20.354 --> 00:22.323
were happy to leave
the cooking to a microwave.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.759
Aww. Look at you two.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.761
Snuggled up on the couch.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.962
And what the hell is that?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.531
Oh, I made us
Hungry-Man dinners.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.000
I'm hungry. I'm a man.
It lines up.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.735
Well, that was
so thoughtful of you

00:34.802 --> 00:37.905
to make Barry a delightful mix
of mystery meat and radiation.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.940
Thank you. I think?

00:40.007 --> 00:42.710
Sweetie, I know you grew up
in a lawless, broken home,

00:42.776 --> 00:45.012
but these frozen,
compartment-based dinners

00:45.079 --> 00:47.348
are unacceptable for Barry...
No offense.

00:47.415 --> 00:50.484
You can't just tag
"no offense"
on the end of something

00:50.551 --> 00:52.553
horribly offensive
and act like it's okay.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.788
It's just that
Barry requires

00:54.855 --> 00:58.459
a real home-cooked dinner
fit for a boy-king.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.462
As his future wife,
that responsibility
falls on you.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.297
And every creepy thing
you just said

01:03.364 --> 01:06.134
is the reason
why your boy
is so broken... No offense.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.635
Hey.
Your thing does work.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.969
Okay,
I wasn't gonna do this,

01:09.036 --> 01:11.172
but your resistance
shows me that it's time.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.973
Everybody in the kitchen!

01:13.040 --> 01:15.376
Family history is
about to take place!

01:17.711 --> 01:20.013
The others will be down
in a minute.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.583
They'd be crushed
to miss this.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.819
Family presentation!
Down here, now!

01:25.886 --> 01:28.956
They clearly don't care,
but I'm jazzed!

01:29.022 --> 01:30.391
What's the big news?

01:30.458 --> 01:32.193
Lainey, we are gathered
here today

01:32.260 --> 01:34.828
in front of parts of
my entire family

01:34.895 --> 01:36.397
for the bequeathing...

01:36.464 --> 01:39.933
...of our family's
most prized possession.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.335
ADULT ADAM: It was true.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.304
This really was the biggest
deal in the world

01:43.371 --> 01:44.972
to my mom and no one else.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.174
Oh. Recipes?

01:47.508 --> 01:50.378
The keys to Barry's happiness
are in this box.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.479
You're welcome.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.148
Speech! Speech! Speech!

01:54.215 --> 01:56.116
Uh, thanks a ton.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.218
And food is family?

01:57.285 --> 01:59.487
Very nice.
Very nice try.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.121
While I appreciate
the gesture,

02:01.189 --> 02:03.891
I just don't see myself
cooking for Barry, like, ever.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.226
That is the single
most upsetting thing

02:05.293 --> 02:06.727
I've ever heard,
so take the box.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.696
Thanks, but I really
won't use the box,

02:08.762 --> 02:10.130
so I kinda don't
need the box.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.399
Well,
I don't need the box.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.567
I've got the box memorized,
so take the box.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.135
Just take the box!

02:15.203 --> 02:16.870
Fine!
I'll take the box!

02:16.937 --> 02:19.240
Yay! My Schmoopy-in-law
wants the box!

02:19.307 --> 02:22.009
Oh!
Speech! Speech, speech!

02:22.075 --> 02:24.545
My Barry's in
such good hands.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.013
* I'm twisted up inside

02:26.079 --> 02:28.949
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:32.152 --> 02:33.621
* I don't know the future

02:33.687 --> 02:36.457
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:36.524 --> 02:38.892
ADULT ADAM: It was September
1980-something,

02:38.959 --> 02:42.196
a brand-new year of school
with my same old,
awesome friends.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.731
Hey, dumb-ass.
Still a dumb

02:43.797 --> 02:45.065
You know it, Muscles.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.368
Dave Kim, see you're still
rocking the turtleneck.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.937
I was thinking of making the
switch to a mock turtleneck,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.572
but why change
what works?

02:51.639 --> 02:52.740
Adam!

02:52.806 --> 02:54.442
Jackie?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.910
ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
there was one person
who changed a ton

02:56.977 --> 02:58.746
over the summer.
My sci-fi-loving,

02:58.812 --> 03:00.414
theater-geek girlfriend,
Jackie Geary.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.482
I missed you so much!

03:01.549 --> 03:02.616
Me too.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.117
Ow! Something sharp
stabbed my torso!

03:04.184 --> 03:05.553
Sorry, safety pin.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.854
Don't you just love
this jacket?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.789
I got it at a thrift shop
in the Village.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.624
What happened to
the crushed velvet cloak

03:10.691 --> 03:11.792
I found you
at the Ren Faire?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.227
Kinda got swampy
in the subway.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.728
You went on the subway?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.797
But that's where breakdancing
gangs shake you down for cash!

03:16.864 --> 03:19.667
Turns out, Breakin' 2:
Electric Boogaloo lied to us.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.569
I had the best time
exploring the city.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.904
Next year, you have to do
the NYU summer program.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.205
You won't regret it.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.107
Yeah, my mom said I can never
live in New York,

03:27.174 --> 03:28.676
'cause the pigeons
are too aggressive

03:28.742 --> 03:30.278
and the poisonous
air-conditioner juice

03:30.344 --> 03:32.079
from apartments drips
on your head as you walk.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.082
Dude, I discovered
all this cool
new music and clothes

03:35.148 --> 03:36.750
and made
tons of new friends.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.885
Speaking of...

03:37.951 --> 03:39.152
'Sup, skank?
Carla?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.755
This special and terrifying
person's now your friend?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.457
Well, when I first got there,
I didn't know anyone,

03:43.524 --> 03:46.126
and then I saw Carla,
and I was like,
"Ah, crap, it's Carla.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.661
She's probably gonna
make fun of my face

03:47.728 --> 03:49.229
and then tell everyone
I'm a total nerd."

03:49.297 --> 03:50.464
And I totally did.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.966
But then Jack Attack
let me borrow her hairbrush,

03:53.033 --> 03:54.702
and I was like,
"You're my best friend now."

03:54.768 --> 03:56.069
She kicked a rat for me.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.473
Well, it sounds like
you and Jack Attack
had a good time.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.509
Ooh, talk later!
Save me a spot at lunch!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.944
Dude, is it me
or did your lady
go away for the summer

04:04.011 --> 04:05.513
and come back
a totally different person?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.180
ADULT ADAM:
Sure, Jackie didn't
look the same,

04:07.247 --> 04:10.250
but that didn't matter to me,
'cause we still loved
the same nerdy stuff.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.685
Boom!
No way!

04:11.752 --> 04:13.987
You got us tickets
for the school Bazaar-nival!

04:14.054 --> 04:16.624
That's right. One part bazaar,
one part carnival.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.791
Two parts fun.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.892
You're so cute.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.694
Are you swooning
at a Bazaar

04:20.761 --> 04:23.464
It's our special thing
since we had our first kiss
on the bumper cars.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.665
That's how I chipped
my tooth.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.367
It was a magical time.
So jealous.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.635
So, I'll pick you up
Saturday night?

04:27.701 --> 04:28.836
Saturday?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.738
Oh, man, Carla and I
already have plans

04:30.804 --> 04:32.306
to watch her boyfriend
drag-race.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.808
The Bazaar-nival's got
a crafting booth
and candy apples.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.143
Not that it's
a competition.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.979
I'll just cancel
my plans with Carla.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.113
No, don't do that.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.482
Are you sure you
don't want to come?

04:41.549 --> 04:44.217
I already have my ticket.
It's okay. You should go.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.219
Yeah. You're right.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.488
I'll see you later.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.760
How could Jackie pass
on the Bazaar

04:52.826 --> 04:53.861
It's the Bazaar-nival!

04:53.927 --> 04:55.929
Bro, your lady just went
full Zuko on you.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.298
Full wha?
You know, Danny Zuko
from "Grease."

04:58.366 --> 05:00.601
After months of summer loving,
Sandy returns to school

05:00.668 --> 05:01.902
and finds Zuko
totally changed.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.671
In this instance,
you're the Sandy.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.373
And like the movie,
the only way to keep your girl

05:05.439 --> 05:06.840
is to change everything
about yourself

05:06.907 --> 05:07.908
in utter desperation.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.610
That's a horrible message
for children!

05:09.677 --> 05:11.879
The worst. But the songs
are real toe-tappers.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.147
While I was dreading
losing my geeky girlfriend,

05:14.214 --> 05:16.850
Lainey dreaded her future
as Barry's mom.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.520
I can't believe your
mom forced me to take
the box! The nerve!

05:19.587 --> 05:21.321
Well, did you at least
give a speech to honor
the big moment?

05:21.389 --> 05:22.490
Calm down, Geoff.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.557
Lainey will lend you
the dumb box

05:23.624 --> 05:25.192
so that you can cook
and bake for me, too.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.194
No! Your mom gave it
to her, not me.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.929
I'll just make you
store-bought cookies
from a mix,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.330
like some stupid
face off the street!

05:30.398 --> 05:31.432
Okay, we get it!

05:31.499 --> 05:32.800
Clearly, you wanna be
Erica's mom,

05:32.866 --> 05:33.934
but I'm not going
down that way.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.736
You apologize for nothing!

05:35.803 --> 05:37.905
Look in my wild, angry eyes.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.773
The last thing I want
is for you to be my mom.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.042
You mean it?
More than anything, baby!

05:42.109 --> 05:44.044
I've never been more excited
about our future together.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.080
This is my life now.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.549
And it sucks.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.551
But you just told
Lainey you didn't care
if she cooked or not.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.252
Dude, of course I care.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.922
Dinner's the only time
of day I can be me!

05:54.988 --> 05:57.958
I love racing home
to a warm blanket of Parm.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.460
That's how our family
expresses love...

05:59.527 --> 06:00.861
Through melted cheese.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.397
Damn it, I want Erica
to experience
that cheese love, too!

06:03.464 --> 06:04.998
You gotta get me a peek
at that box.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.900
Wait. Maybe there's a way
we can both get what we want.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.002
Name it. I'm in.
Take it. It's yours.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.638
Wait. You're giving
me the box?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.072
But your mom handed it off
to Lainey.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.841
Indeed she did,
young Geoffrey.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.943
And when Lainey realizes
the box is gone,

06:16.009 --> 06:17.745
she'll feel so guilty,

06:17.811 --> 06:20.213
she'll let my mom
teach her all the recipes.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.549
So you do want Lainey
to be your mom.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.750
Ew! Gross!

06:22.816 --> 06:25.252
But for sure, yes.
I want my wife to be my mom.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.020
That's weird...
But I get it!

06:27.087 --> 06:28.121
I want to be
my girlfriend's mom!

06:28.188 --> 06:30.958
Dude, there's no one
I'd rather have

06:31.024 --> 06:32.993
be a mom to my sister
than you.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.764
Sir, it would be
an honor to be
your mother/brother-in-law.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.634
With my looks and my brains,
we can't fail!

06:43.737 --> 06:45.606
You can't put metal
in the microwave.
Got it.

06:45.673 --> 06:46.974
ADULT ADAM: As Barry's plan
sparked to life,

06:47.040 --> 06:48.609
I went to my love guru,

06:48.676 --> 06:50.343
who could help me
find the spark with Jackie.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.646
Pops, I have
a romantic emergency,

06:52.713 --> 06:54.582
and I need some of
your patented love advice.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.184
That's exactly why
I sit here all day.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.686
Jackie came back
from summer break,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.754
and now she's all New York-ish
and fringy.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.756
Dave Kim says
if I don't change,
we're done.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.959
Dave Kim...
Always stirring the pot.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.962
You need to be proud
of who you are

07:09.029 --> 07:11.632
and never change
for anyone.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.767
Wrong. You gotta change
and change hard.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.504
Ya think?
No! Don't listen to him.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.706
He's not even
in this conversation.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.973
He's behind the paper!

07:20.040 --> 07:22.610
Ya gotta change
when you date
someone more pretty.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.811
Like me and your mom.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.646
That makes sense!
No, it doesn't!

07:25.713 --> 07:27.715
You're just intrigued
because the paper

07:27.781 --> 07:29.817
makes him hidden
and mysterious.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.985
You wouldn't believe
the things
I did for that woman.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.220
Tell me more,
dark stranger.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.822
I took square-dancing
lessons,

07:34.888 --> 07:36.356
I brunched
with her friends,

07:36.423 --> 07:38.358
I even took my shoes off
at the beach.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.727
And the guy is still
with my mom!

07:39.793 --> 07:42.796
It's your dad!
You know who he is!

07:42.863 --> 07:45.733
ADULT ADAM:
True, and yet I still listened
to the wise voice

07:45.799 --> 07:47.000
hidden behind
the sports section.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.502
I headed straight to
the coolest store

07:48.569 --> 07:49.937
on South Street...
Zipperhead.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.271
Back then,
it was the one place

07:51.338 --> 07:53.106
you'd go
for all your punk needs.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.742
Hello, there, fine madam.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.477
I'm here to purchase
some of your fine
anti-monarchy garb.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.513
Beat it, yuppie. Go
home and wait for
"L.A. Law" to come on.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.749
She knows what we watch.
Let's bail.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.551
No. This is too important.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.818
Nothing can help you,
poser.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.555
Pfft!
I am not a poser.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.389
Name one member
of The Clash.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.624
"Of the Titans"?

08:10.691 --> 08:12.760
Well, there's Zeus
and that metal robot owl,

08:12.826 --> 08:15.395
and, of course, Harry Hamlin
from "L.A. Law" plays Perseus.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.230
Stop talking,
and I'll help you.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.366
First, we gotta fix
your dumb hair.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.102
I'll do whatever it takes
to turn into Eric Idle.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.704
I think you mean
Billy Idol.
Right!

08:23.771 --> 08:25.906
So, how long will it take
to get cool, punky...

08:25.973 --> 08:27.675
Gah! Oh, boy,
it smells so weird!

08:27.741 --> 08:29.509
This is not gonna be
an easy process for you.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.545
ADULT ADAM:
Yep. My change all began
with my hair.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.548
Meanwhile, Barry's harebrained
scheme was about to unfold.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.850
Barry, we need to talk.
I'm in huge trouble, dude!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.952
Good thing I was just
sitting here waiting for you.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.789
What is it?
Someone stole your mom's
recipe box out of my purse!

08:41.855 --> 08:43.691
Oh, no!

08:43.757 --> 08:45.225
How could something
like this happen?

08:45.292 --> 08:46.927
I know!
It's so weird!

08:46.994 --> 08:49.630
They didn't take my car keys
or my wallet or my Walkman.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.799
Not all thieves are in it
for the money.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.767
Some are after
the hottest food trends.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.269
Thief-cooks, they're called.
This was so important
to your mom.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.537
She'll never forgive me!

08:57.605 --> 09:00.173
But with me at your side,
we'll find a way.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.441
You're an amazing
human being.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.943
Must feel good
to say it out loud.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.013
Mother, we have
some terrible news.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.782
Oh, no. Is it Lyme
disease

09:08.849 --> 09:10.550
I saw a deer on the way home
from the mall.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.452
It is much worse
than a rogue deer.

09:12.519 --> 09:15.555
Worse than a rogue deer that
may or may not have a tick?

09:15.623 --> 09:17.157
What are you trying
to tell me, Barry?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.926
Someone stole your recipes
out of my bag.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.294
No!
Please, tell me how
I can make this right.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.664
Well, you could call
all of my relatives

09:23.731 --> 09:24.832
that knew the recipes...

09:24.898 --> 09:26.767
Oh, wait...
They're all dead.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.936
Whoa! I'm just
thinking out loud,

09:29.002 --> 09:32.105
but I believe my mom
knows all those recipes
by heart, yes?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.742
My broken heart.
Perhaps if you let
my mom teach you

09:34.808 --> 09:36.109
how to cook
those recipes,

09:36.176 --> 09:37.911
one of the cornerstones
of caring for me,

09:37.978 --> 09:39.146
then all will
be forgiven?

09:39.212 --> 09:41.048
Babe, thank you for
helping us through this.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.350
As we've established,
I'm the best.
So, what do you say?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.452
I say...
(BILLY IDOL'S
WHITE WEDDING PLAYS)

09:45.518 --> 09:46.754
we better hit the market.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.355
We're gonna need
all their meats and cheeses.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.957
ADULT ADAM:
As my mom took Lainey
under her wing,

09:50.023 --> 09:51.792
my new look had taken flight.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.961
I had my new hair,
studded vest,

09:54.027 --> 09:57.164
and a Black Flag shirt,
which I thought was bug spray.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.866
Goodbye, Sandy from "Grease"!

09:58.932 --> 10:00.400
Hello, Billy Idol!

10:00.467 --> 10:02.870
Whoa! Check out
the hot new guy!

10:02.936 --> 10:04.872
I feel threatened
and I wanna
punch your face off.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.139
No, wait! It's me!

10:06.206 --> 10:07.641
Adam?
Jackie's boyfriend?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.977
Why didn't you say so?
I almost went to
jail just now.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.478
Cool.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.881
If you see Jackie, tell her
I'm in for Saturday night.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.048
Let's burn some rubber.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.483
Wait. You race?

10:16.549 --> 10:17.584
But Jackie said
you're, like,

10:17.651 --> 10:19.787
afraid of birds
and have allergies.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.655
Not allergic to speed.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.691
Just cat dander
and feather pillows.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.025
What kinda wheels
you driving, bro?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.895
I got me a sick wagon.
Station style.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.697
Wood panels,
bitchin' roof rack.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.832
I got a gnarly
Celica ST.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.133
You wanna race
for pink slips?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.835
The pinker the better,
Holmes!

10:34.902 --> 10:37.871
Sick! I'll spread the word,
make sure the whole
school shows up!

10:37.938 --> 10:39.006
Oh, uh,
the whole what, now?

10:39.072 --> 10:40.440
Hells yeah.
I'm on it.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.676
New Goldberg's got nards,
and I like it.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.977
Hope there's
no hard feelings

10:44.044 --> 10:46.213
when I smoke you
and take your car.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.418
Wait, that's what
a pink slip is?

10:51.484 --> 10:55.155
Oh, balls.
This went bad fast.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.759
After going punk for my lady,
all I needed now
was badass wheels.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.360
Ah! I hear jingling!

11:00.427 --> 11:01.594
Don't know
which moron that is,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.864
but if you want my car,
then take Pops home.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.165
Yeah,
I could use a ride.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.834
Ah, come on!

11:06.900 --> 11:08.836
Fine. 'Cause I love you!
Let's get moving!

11:08.902 --> 11:11.038
Bup bup! You know
all those paving stones?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.740
You mean the ones
Mom has screamed at you

11:12.806 --> 11:14.041
to return
for the last year?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.475
Yeah, load 'em up
in the car

11:15.542 --> 11:17.845
and take 'em back to
Heckingers before they
close in an hour.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.479
No! Can't I do this
another time?

11:19.546 --> 11:21.548
Nah, it'll feel good
to get it off my plate.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.217
Aw, crap!

11:24.284 --> 11:26.854
I accidentally ripped
my purposely ripped jeans!

11:26.920 --> 11:29.957
You actually bought
tattered jeans
with holes?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.058
Who does that?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.625
Badasses like me.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.927
While I hit a detour,

11:33.994 --> 11:36.496
inside was a race
for the perfect Parm.

11:36.563 --> 11:39.332
Okay, here you go.
Pork Parm Wellington.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.869
Attempt number nine,
so, dear God,
please like it.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.336
Uh...

11:43.403 --> 11:44.471
Close enough.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.006
Let's just move on
to meatloaf burgers.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.910
No! Not till we've
perfectly baked all
53 ingredients.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.178
Or is it 54?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.413
I thought you said you knew
all the recipes by heart.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.215
No yenta in the world
can remember

11:55.282 --> 11:57.050
every ounce of butter
and pinch of salt

11:57.117 --> 11:58.952
that goes into
this many dishes!

11:59.019 --> 12:00.788
Can't I just order Barry
Chinese food every night?

12:00.854 --> 12:02.455
You think this is
just about cooking?

12:02.522 --> 12:05.325
There is so much
more that goes into
taking care of our Barry.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.961
Like what?
Washing his Flyers shirts,

12:08.028 --> 12:10.263
flipping his covers
when he sweats at night,

12:10.330 --> 12:12.766
reminding him to make
when he waits too long

12:12.833 --> 12:13.967
and gets plugged up.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.068
What is that?
What are you doing?

12:15.135 --> 12:16.770
It's the signal
for poo-poos.

12:16.837 --> 12:17.905
You gotta learn
the signal.

12:17.971 --> 12:18.972
I don't wanna
learn the signal!

12:19.039 --> 12:20.307
Don't make her do
the signal, Mom!

12:20.373 --> 12:21.474
She has to learn
the signal!

12:21.541 --> 12:22.709
I don't wanna
learn the signal.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.977
Now, this hand
is the potty,

12:24.044 --> 12:26.679
beckoning the poo-poos,
and in they go.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.148
Huh?
She's not doing it!

12:28.215 --> 12:30.417
Of course
I'm not doing it!
Don't turn on each other!

12:30.483 --> 12:33.686
Go back to bonding over food
as I grab some fresh air.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.922
Be right back.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.028
Hard to run
after so much eating!

12:43.496 --> 12:45.032
Dude!
Where is the box?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.166
It's on the counter.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.835
Your mom has
some real gems in there.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.669
I made a hearty chowder
for Erica.

12:49.736 --> 12:50.804
Here, take a spoonful.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.505
No! I don't have time
to eat...

12:52.572 --> 12:53.573
Mmm!

12:53.640 --> 12:55.008
Tastes like our summers
at the shore.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.010
But enough
of your dumb thing.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.979
I need a recipe.
Stat.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.148
ADULT ADAM:
Barry knew there was
only one ingredient

13:01.214 --> 13:02.582
that could save his plan.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.684
Meanwhile, the recipe
for a badass drag race...

13:04.751 --> 13:07.154
...just needed one
more thing. Me.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.588
Where's Goldnerd?

13:08.655 --> 13:10.057
I've been revving
my engine
for the crowd,

13:10.123 --> 13:11.491
but it's losing
its luster!

13:11.558 --> 13:13.526
Wait!
Here he comes!

13:13.593 --> 13:16.296
ADULT ADAM:
I may have been drag racing
like Zuko,

13:16.363 --> 13:18.198
but Greased Lightning
I wasn't.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.345
'Sup, people
and the place to be!

13:32.412 --> 13:34.014
Adam?
Jack Attack! What's up?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.949
I honestly have
no idea.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.151
What is on your body
right now?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.187
I kinda ripped
my punk-rock jeans

13:40.253 --> 13:41.454
on a jagged
paving stone,

13:41.521 --> 13:43.857
so then I ripped off
the other leg to be matchy

13:43.924 --> 13:45.158
like a badass.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.160
Okay, but what's up
with your hair?

13:47.227 --> 13:48.495
Just how I roll, bro.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.763
Also, I forgot
to wash out the Sun-In,

13:50.830 --> 13:54.201
so then the actual
blazing sun
overbaked my head

13:54.267 --> 13:57.204
when I was loading in those
aforementioned paving stones

13:57.270 --> 13:59.739
in the back of my ol'
wood-paneled rocket here.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.774
Okay, but why are you
wearing snow gloves?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.877
Don't own racing gloves,
so I'mma tear it up

14:03.944 --> 14:05.712
in these Freezy Freakies
'cause I'm crazy like that.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.815
Okay, but why did
you bring an old man
to a drag race?

14:08.882 --> 14:11.618
That's my boy Al.
Had to drop him off
at his sick pad,

14:11.684 --> 14:13.786
but the bumpy car ride
lulled him to sleep

14:13.853 --> 14:15.655
which is good,
'cause he would
not approve

14:15.722 --> 14:17.190
of my drag-racing
lifestyle.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.059
I don't even know
who you are right now.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.193
Looks like
you're not the only one

14:20.260 --> 14:21.661
who's changed for the better
this year.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.297
Yo, no more stalling.
It's go time!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.166
Let's ride.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.734
ADULT ADAM: That day, I wasn't
the only one
racing for my life.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.837
"Bring to simmer,
caramelize the onions,

14:30.904 --> 14:32.839
"sprinkle two pinches
of celery salt."

14:34.041 --> 14:35.075
Needs more wrist.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.776
More wrist.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.645
Forget the signal!

14:38.711 --> 14:40.580
I realized on my walk home

14:40.647 --> 14:42.549
you need to caramelize
the onions,

14:42.615 --> 14:45.585
then sprinkle two pinches
of celery salt.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.020
How do you know
about celery salt?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.923
Oh. Um,
eater's intuition?

14:49.990 --> 14:51.491
It's my recipe.
How did you...

14:51.558 --> 14:52.692
I'll tell you how.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.094
You stole the box,
didn't you?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.395
No! Also, yes.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.164
But you told me
you didn't want me
to baby you,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.999
like your mom does.
And I don't!

14:59.066 --> 15:00.667
Also, I do.
Tell you what.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.169
You already have a mom,

15:02.235 --> 15:03.803
and you can keep her!
No! You're not
getting it!

15:03.870 --> 15:06.073
If anything, you're
a smoking-hot mom
with benefits!

15:06.506 --> 15:07.507
Ew!

15:09.209 --> 15:12.345
How could this happen to
a boy-king I raised
so normally?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.016
It was go time.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.451
Our engines were roaring, and
everything was on the line,

15:18.518 --> 15:20.887
my car, my dignity,

15:20.954 --> 15:23.390
but most importantly,
my future with Jackie.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.963
Listen, I kind of borrowed
this car from my dad,

15:30.030 --> 15:32.632
so it's not really mine
to lose.
You get it, right?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.467
The only thing I'm getting
is that car.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.036
And those tasteful
paving stones,

15:36.103 --> 15:37.370
which will encourage
outdoor living

15:37.437 --> 15:38.838
during the warm
summer months.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.807
Ahh!

15:40.873 --> 15:43.043
(STAN BUSH'S FIGHT TO SURVIVE
PLAYS)

15:49.149 --> 15:51.684
Whoo-hoo!
Ahh!

15:54.554 --> 15:55.888
Come on, baby!

15:55.955 --> 15:57.624
Oh, no!
This is bullcrap!

15:57.690 --> 16:00.060
I revved so much
for the crowd,
I got no gas left!

16:00.127 --> 16:03.063
Push it, baby! I love you,
but only if you win!

16:16.543 --> 16:17.644
Hey, you're cheating!

16:17.710 --> 16:19.279
Said to the barrel
and back!

16:25.985 --> 16:29.289
Ponytail losing power.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.498
Jackie! We did it, baby!
We won!

16:38.565 --> 16:41.068
Yeah, congratulations
on getting from
here to there

16:41.134 --> 16:43.503
slightly quicker than Johnny
was able to push his car.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.138
You mean my car.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.407
Pink slip's mine, Atkins.
I'm taking the Celica.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.708
You can't take
the Celica!

16:48.775 --> 16:50.377
You can't take his
Celica, Adam.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.744
You can't take
the Celica!

16:51.811 --> 16:54.214
Oh, I'm taking the Celica!
But it's my mom's!

16:54.281 --> 16:56.316
She needs it to get to the
dental office in the morning.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.152
Hey, you were gonna take
my car and the paving stones.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.554
I just said that
for the pageantry
of the event!

17:01.621 --> 17:03.623
Please! My brother has tennis
after school!

17:03.690 --> 17:06.126
Well, he ain't getting there
in my Celica!

17:06.193 --> 17:07.560
You can't take
the Celica!

17:07.627 --> 17:10.597
Jackie, your boyfriend's
got a real nasty way
about him.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.066
This is not
my boyfriend.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.001
At least,
not the one that I want.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.869
I think it's pretty clear
what you want.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.971
And it's not us.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.174
Why?
You went away
and changed,

17:21.241 --> 17:23.110
and I'm still
the same old Adam.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.378
I just loved
what we had.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.480
And now it's over.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.722
BEVERLY: Hey, Squish.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.290
Now that I got
my recipes back,

17:37.357 --> 17:40.093
I thought maybe a little bit
of Mama's cheeseburger pot pie

17:40.160 --> 17:41.194
might cheer you up.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.362
Not hungry.
What?

17:42.429 --> 17:45.132
I've literally never
heard you say that.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.566
I just realized
me and Lainey

17:46.633 --> 17:49.035
want the complete opposite
kind of marriage.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.670
She wants
an equal partnership,

17:50.737 --> 17:53.340
while I want her to
tend to my needs the
rest of our days.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.807
There's no
right or wrong here.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.677
A good relationship
needs a lot of
give-and-take, Barry.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.612
Why can't it be
like you and Dad?

17:59.679 --> 18:02.249
You know, where you give
and he takes.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.951
I've heard enough, moron.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.786
Not all marriages
are the same.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.921
Stop worrying about
what you want to take

18:08.988 --> 18:11.023
and start thinking about
what you want to give.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.825
Wow.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.928
So, maybe
Lainey has a point.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.364
You're right.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.931
I'm lucky I had
someone like you

18:18.998 --> 18:20.533
taking care of me
my whole life.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.536
I learned
from the best

18:23.603 --> 18:25.238
which means now
I can take care of Lainey.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.873
Wait.
You want the box?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.476
Cooking is how our family
shows love, right?

18:29.542 --> 18:32.479
So now it's time
I show Lainey
how much I love her.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.581
Although, I could use
a few pointers.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.118
ADULT ADAM:
And that night, they whisked,

18:39.186 --> 18:40.820
they battered,

18:40.887 --> 18:42.789
they rolled and seasoned,

18:42.855 --> 18:44.357
until they had
pork Parm Wellington

18:44.424 --> 18:46.326
fit for a boy-king's queen.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.660
* ...white wedding

18:50.197 --> 18:54.201
* It's a nice day
to start again

18:54.267 --> 18:55.735
Hey.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.270
Believe me,
the last thing
I want right now

18:57.337 --> 18:58.671
is your mom's cooking.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.974
Actually...

19:02.775 --> 19:04.911
I made it.
For you.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.547
You really think cooking
me one dinner is gonna
change anything?

19:07.614 --> 19:08.915
It's not about this one.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.250
It's about
the next thousand.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.984
I just...

19:12.051 --> 19:14.554
God, this sounds
so stupid.
No, say it.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.690
Every day,
you take care of me
just by being you. And...

19:19.592 --> 19:21.461
I realized

19:21.528 --> 19:24.897
now it's my job
to take care of you.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.433
How about we just take care
of each other?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.435
Deal.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.904
* It's a nice day
for a white wedding

19:34.674 --> 19:37.176
Winner number one.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.478
A winner.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.713
Dude.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.582
You suck at driving.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.116
How'd you know
I'd be here?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.018
Because
it's the Bazaar-nival.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.354
I knew
you wouldn't miss it.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.557
It turns out the Bazaar-nival
is not that many parts fun.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.925
It's completely lame.
And so am I.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.127
I never said
it was lame.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.896
And I certainly
never asked you

19:56.963 --> 19:58.565
to cut your jeans
into Daisy Dukes.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.132
I know!

20:00.199 --> 20:04.070
I just loved that I actually
found someone out there

20:04.136 --> 20:06.038
who was just like me,

20:06.105 --> 20:08.140
someone who could geek out
over a good Bazaar-nival.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.411
Adam, even though I changed
a bit over the summer

20:11.478 --> 20:13.413
doesn't mean
we're not the same.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.616
And nothing will ever change
the way I feel about you.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.485
Really?
I will always love

20:18.551 --> 20:21.721
my allergenic,
Bazaar-nival-loving,
nerd boyfriend.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.693
* It's a nice day
to start again *

20:26.759 --> 20:28.428
ADULT ADAM:
Sure, change is scary.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.497
Sometimes we're so desperate
to hold on to the past

20:30.563 --> 20:32.999
that we lose sight
of who we really are.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.668
But in the end,
when we open our hearts

20:35.735 --> 20:39.138
to accept those we love most
for who they really are,

20:39.205 --> 20:41.341
a little change can
be a wild ride

20:41.408 --> 20:43.075
that stays with you forever.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.813
ADAM: Can I come in?
Never.

20:46.879 --> 20:50.016
No. This is
so teenagery...

20:50.082 --> 20:51.684
Is it?
...that I don't want
any recording

20:51.751 --> 20:53.786
of it on any kind of tape.
Yeah, I wouldn't do
that to you.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.123
Hi. I'm with
the real Jackie Geary,

20:57.189 --> 20:58.791
Adam's high school
girlfriend,

20:58.858 --> 21:00.560
and we have
some questions for you.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.963
I'm ready.
Now, were you into
theater and movies

21:04.030 --> 21:05.798
and all the geeky stuff
Adam is into?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.500
Or were you just
going along with it?

21:07.567 --> 21:09.636
I was also a big geek.
Yeah.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.439
I was into different
geeky stuff sometimes,

21:12.505 --> 21:15.308
like "Star Trek" being
better than "Star Wars."

21:15.375 --> 21:17.344
Turns out
Jackie likes "Star Trek"

21:17.410 --> 21:18.711
more than "Star Wars"!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.980
Adam remembers you
going from theater geek

21:21.047 --> 21:22.849
to cool, fringy
New York City girl.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.517
Who did I think I was?
