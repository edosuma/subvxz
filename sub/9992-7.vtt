Previously on Medium:

00:02.274 --> 00:03.182
Allison Dubois?

00:03.533 --> 00:04.094
Yes?

00:04.154 --> 00:05.705
You're ordered to appear and give testimony

00:05.758 --> 00:08.496
in the matter of The State of Arizona v. Nicholas Morgante.

00:08.651 --> 00:12.331
What makes you so special, Mrs. Dubois?

00:13.467 --> 00:16.007
What do you really do for the District Attorney?

00:16.094 --> 00:18.808
Who are you really, Mrs. Dubois?

00:20.021 --> 00:22.873
Well, I'm not Adam Humphries.

00:23.003 --> 00:24.957
- What did you just say?
- Adam Humphries.

00:25.012 --> 00:26.821
- He took your Bar exam for you.
- I can't hear them. Can you hear them?

00:26.930 --> 00:29.124
...after you cheated but still failed three times.

00:29.273 --> 00:31.689
- Counselor...
- And I'm not Dean Gardner.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.728
You bribed him to keep quiet in your last murder trial.

00:35.023 --> 00:36.257
So now you know.

00:36.887 --> 00:39.769
Do you really want to keep asking me who I am?

00:39.846 --> 00:43.296
- Mr. Watt?
- At the risk of everyone finding out who you are?

00:55.787 --> 00:58.913
I read the most amazing article in The New Yorker the other night.

00:59.892 --> 01:03.035
This social scientist, this researcher

01:03.216 --> 01:05.604
went out and did this study where she interviewed everyone

01:05.672 --> 01:09.328
who had ever attempted to kill themselves by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:10.567 --> 01:13.827
And it turns out every single person she interviewed,

01:14.254 --> 01:19.721
every single one confessed that after they threw themselves off that bridge,

01:19.946 --> 01:21.897
about two-thirds of the way down,

01:22.588 --> 01:26.561
it suddenly occurred to them that all the seemingly insurmountable problems

01:26.623 --> 01:28.655
they've had in their lives were fixable--

01:29.664 --> 01:31.947
every single one.

01:33.785 --> 01:37.604
Save for the fact that they had just thrown themselves off the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:38.850 --> 01:42.398
The girl you're looking at has just jumped off a 300-foot cliff.

01:42.926 --> 01:45.834
Right now, she's two-thirds of the way down.

01:49.712 --> 01:51.496
Ooh, Joe.

01:53.518 --> 01:54.619
Hey, Joe?

01:55.418 --> 01:57.000
Could you give me a hand, darling?

01:58.906 --> 02:01.132
Hey... a little help here?

02:02.867 --> 02:04.173
Thanks a lot.

02:52.106 --> 02:53.633
Honey, I hate to do this to you.

02:53.704 --> 02:57.549
Could you take the girls to school and drop me off at day care on your way to work?

02:57.632 --> 02:59.643
Al, what are you talking about? I don't have a car this morning.

02:59.715 --> 03:01.082
It's in the shop, remember?

03:01.302 --> 03:02.833
You were gonna drop me off at work today.

03:03.658 --> 03:05.644
Oh, sh...ipwreck!

03:05.752 --> 03:09.469
Shipwreck. Okay, guys, hey. Go get your backpacks. Hurry up.

03:10.185 --> 03:12.413
Mommy's running late. Take her and go find her shoe.

03:13.801 --> 03:14.850
Come on, Bridg.

03:15.303 --> 03:18.296
For those of us who tuned in late, what's the rush?

03:19.832 --> 03:21.065
I had a dream last night.

03:22.008 --> 03:23.391
Of course you did.

03:23.564 --> 03:25.039
In it, a girl committed suicide.

03:25.116 --> 03:27.333
She threw herself off a cliff in the desert.

03:27.732 --> 03:29.698
I don't think anybody knows she's there.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.441
I think that's why I had the dream.

03:31.547 --> 03:32.227
I see.

03:32.730 --> 03:33.846
Actually, I don't.

03:33.948 --> 03:37.025
Okay, I want to go to work so I can let law enforcement know

03:37.107 --> 03:40.076
so they can launch a search so they can find the body.

03:41.479 --> 03:43.439
So let's me see if I got this right.

03:43.579 --> 03:47.260
Some cosmic force is smart enough and all-knowing enough to know

03:47.337 --> 03:49.917
that you work for the D.A., so it shows you this dream,

03:50.015 --> 03:51.929
knowing that you can do something about it,

03:52.007 --> 03:56.152
but this same cosmic force isn't all-knowing enough to know that on this particular morning,

03:56.335 --> 04:00.167
you have to drive your husband to work, 'cause his car needs its 15,000-mile service.

04:00.255 --> 04:01.090
Not funny.

04:01.474 --> 04:02.385
I'm not trying to be.

04:04.044 --> 04:04.991
What you looking for?

04:05.237 --> 04:07.187
Keys. Girls, have you seen my keys?

04:07.269 --> 04:09.722
Keys? I would think even to get a psychic's learner's permit

04:09.794 --> 04:11.636
you'd have to be able to find a lost set of...

04:11.718 --> 04:12.603
Keys?

04:14.897 --> 04:17.791
Girls, Mama's got some keys.

04:19.454 --> 04:21.498
Okay, thanks for the ride.

04:21.610 --> 04:22.530
And don't worry, you know.

04:22.599 --> 04:25.772
If my car's not ready, I'll get a ride with someone else.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.417
Don't do that. I'll pick you up.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.390
Hey, there.

04:28.528 --> 04:29.397
Hey, Brett.

04:30.267 --> 04:32.255
Carpooling? What are you, a Democrat?

04:33.186 --> 04:35.543
Allison, this is Brett. You've heard me talk about Brett, right?

04:36.315 --> 04:37.559
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:37.651 --> 04:38.803
I've heard a lot about you.

04:40.182 --> 04:41.010
Clear!

04:44.696 --> 04:47.312
We've been working on that wind shear algorithm thing I've been telling you about.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.513
Oh, that thing.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.989
Oh, that thing.

04:52.612 --> 04:55.602
I can tell you two have been talking each other's ears off about this.

04:56.617 --> 04:58.849
I'll be upstairs in the Fortress of Solitude.

04:59.546 --> 05:01.844
- It was nice to meet you, Allison.
- Nice to meet you, Brett.

05:03.672 --> 05:05.950
- Seems like a nice guy.
- He is a nice guy.

05:07.793 --> 05:08.934
What's with that look?

05:09.319 --> 05:12.360
Huh?  I don't have a look. I'm lookless. I got to go.

05:12.477 --> 05:15.785
Okay, all right. Well, good luck with that, you know, that thing, you know.

05:16.533 --> 05:17.485
Thank you.

05:17.639 --> 05:19.185
You're welcome. All part of the service.

05:41.038 --> 05:43.506
I didn't mean to frighten you. Didn't realize anyone was here.

05:43.734 --> 05:47.310
Oh, it's okay. I was just... I was... Sorry, I'll get out of your way.

05:52.508 --> 05:54.314
Having a seance, Ms. Dubois?

05:55.020 --> 05:56.675
Conjuring a demon, actually.

05:59.168 --> 06:00.411
We just need a few minutes.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.198
You got to give it to God.

06:09.547 --> 06:12.010
Food, sex-- where'd he come up with this stuff, huh?

06:12.388 --> 06:14.907
Well, for what it's worth, I'm not coming up with anything.

06:15.716 --> 06:16.650
We'll get there.

06:17.637 --> 06:18.967
We've only been working on it...

06:20.841 --> 06:21.973
seven months.

06:23.073 --> 06:24.584
God, we're dumb.

06:25.987 --> 06:30.318
Hey, did we ever run that logarithmic vector shift we were playing with last week?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.426
Something I said?

06:38.423 --> 06:39.345
You all right?

06:44.711 --> 06:45.504
Whoa!

06:46.599 --> 06:47.472
Now I am.

06:47.910 --> 06:50.818
All right, enough fun and games. Back to the coal mine.

06:51.341 --> 06:51.996
You know,

06:53.492 --> 06:54.557
up to here...

06:54.760 --> 06:56.558
I know. It's pretty damn good, isn't it?

06:56.646 --> 06:58.049
We're not a bad team, Ollie.

06:58.632 --> 07:00.071
Now, if we could only get...

07:00.900 --> 07:02.978
from there to there,

07:03.894 --> 07:04.871
that'd be something.

07:06.804 --> 07:07.987
Maybe we could get published.

07:08.744 --> 07:11.775
Get ourselves a little piece of mathematical eternity.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.023
Her parents are on the East Coast.

08:54.269 --> 08:57.090
I  think her boyfriend's gonna come and identify the body.

09:10.552 --> 09:11.682
That's enough.

09:17.889 --> 09:19.465
I came as soon as I could.

09:23.683 --> 09:24.891
What are you doing here?

09:26.791 --> 09:28.184
I found the body.

09:30.934 --> 09:34.807
Well, I'll just step outside. I'm sure that you and your client would like some privacy.

09:35.246 --> 09:38.629
I'd appreciate that, Ms. Dubois, but he's not my client.

09:39.254 --> 09:40.381
He's my son.

09:50.498 --> 09:54.174
It was just weird. The door opens and there he is.

09:54.281 --> 09:55.699
You didn't have a clue, huh?

09:56.426 --> 09:59.749
Don't tell the other psychics, but no, I didn't have a clue.

10:00.092 --> 10:01.255
Here's the funny thing.

10:01.418 --> 10:02.641
I felt bad for the guy.

10:02.831 --> 10:06.097
I mean, he tried to destroy my life in court last month

10:06.176 --> 10:07.808
and I actually felt bad for him.

10:08.173 --> 10:09.744
Karma. It comes around.

10:10.047 --> 10:12.739
Well, karma made a girl kill herself

10:12.836 --> 10:15.145
so that Larry Watt's son could grieve

10:15.232 --> 10:18.724
because his dad was mean to me on a witness stand?

10:18.802 --> 10:19.482
I don't think so.

10:19.554 --> 10:21.925
Fine. That's the last cosmic theory you get out of me.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.446
From now on, I stick to math.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.908
Brett really liked you.

10:31.222 --> 10:32.121
Really?

10:32.420 --> 10:35.464
He said he felt some kind of connection with you.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.799
Hey, he's a single guy. I might have to kill him.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.582
That's not funny.

10:41.264 --> 10:42.209
Okay.

10:48.006 --> 10:48.856
Honey,

10:51.605 --> 10:53.259
there's something I have to tell you.

10:56.556 --> 10:59.203
I'm not sure I really want to know.

10:59.296 --> 11:00.468
Well, it isn't about you.

11:01.589 --> 11:02.537
Is it about you?

11:02.895 --> 11:03.642
No.

11:05.239 --> 11:06.391
It's Brett.

11:08.848 --> 11:12.187
The second I met him, the second I touched his hand,

11:12.996 --> 11:16.259
honey, his health is not good.

11:16.340 --> 11:17.359
What are you talking about?

11:20.006 --> 11:21.056
His heart.

11:21.725 --> 11:23.067
It's not healthy.

11:23.738 --> 11:26.139
It's going to quit on him, and soon.

11:28.781 --> 11:31.326
So what are you saying? You're saying the guy that I work with every day...

11:32.586 --> 11:34.449
my friend, is going to die?

11:36.242 --> 11:37.757
I suppose so.

11:39.962 --> 11:41.772
You suppose so?

11:41.884 --> 11:43.384
This has never happened to me before.

11:43.462 --> 11:45.294
I mean, not with somebody we know.

11:45.883 --> 11:49.953
I have been debating with myself all day whether or not to tell you.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.646
Hmm, well, I'm sorry I missed that debate.

11:51.735 --> 11:53.978
Now, what in the hell am I supposed to do with this information?

11:54.096 --> 11:55.949
I don't know. Have him go to the doctor.

11:56.067 --> 11:56.942
For what?

11:57.552 --> 12:00.603
His anti-premonition vaccine? I mean...

12:02.171 --> 12:04.478
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this.

12:05.709 --> 12:10.393
If you're right, then nothing that I can say is going to make a difference,

12:10.448 --> 12:15.090
and if you're wrong, then I'm just going to completely freak this guy out,

12:15.165 --> 12:17.433
not to mention how do I explain to him...

12:18.355 --> 12:21.637
how I know that he's going to die?

12:22.236 --> 12:24.601
You know what? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

12:24.909 --> 12:26.844
God, or maybe you're right.

12:27.761 --> 12:29.977
Why are you angry with me?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.119
Because...

12:31.999 --> 12:33.688
I don't know! I just...

12:34.006 --> 12:37.498
I liked it so much better when I knew what I knew.

12:37.888 --> 12:40.667
When you would say something like this and I just could ignore it.

12:40.756 --> 12:43.525
Well, I'm sorry I complicated your life.

12:46.275 --> 12:48.332
Hey, wait a second, wait a second. Come back.

12:48.762 --> 12:49.648
Just come back.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.182
So you shook his hand.

12:59.576 --> 13:00.677
And I saw it.

13:01.506 --> 13:02.560
It was him--

13:03.452 --> 13:05.254
in the back of the ambulance,

13:05.648 --> 13:07.680
wearing the company softball shirt.

13:08.039 --> 13:09.673
Flat-lined. He was gone.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.664
What company softball shirt?

13:11.746 --> 13:12.750
Your  company.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.888
They have a softball team. They wear shirts and stuff, and...

13:16.001 --> 13:18.745
When have you ever heard me talk about a company softball team?

13:18.996 --> 13:21.039
Well, I don't know. I just assumed.

13:21.128 --> 13:22.329
Just tell me how this works.

13:22.637 --> 13:24.654
If there's no team and then there's no shirt,

13:24.782 --> 13:27.132
then what does that say about the rest of your story?

13:33.001 --> 13:33.988
Hallelujah.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.508
The  patient lives.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.095
'Night, darling.

14:26.427 --> 14:27.370
Tire tracks?

14:27.549 --> 14:29.555
I think that's what she was trying to show me.

14:30.017 --> 14:32.070
She came to me in my sleep last night.

14:32.382 --> 14:35.455
She flew out of the ravine and led me to the tire of a car.

14:35.536 --> 14:38.624
But why? If this is a suicide, what difference are tire tracks going to make?

14:39.150 --> 14:40.022
I don't know.

14:40.123 --> 14:42.059
I just know... what I saw.

14:43.047 --> 14:45.511
Medical examiner put the time of death somewhere

14:45.582 --> 14:47.834
between noon and 3:00 p.m. on Sunday.

14:48.424 --> 14:52.355
Her cellular phone records show that the last call she made was to your house.

14:52.837 --> 14:54.659
Yeah. We spoke.

14:55.136 --> 14:57.752
Must have been around 12:30.

14:58.473 --> 15:00.861
We talked for maybe ten minutes.

15:00.927 --> 15:02.703
And was she at the overlook when she called?

15:04.116 --> 15:06.226
I didn't know where she was.

15:07.705 --> 15:08.924
She didn't say.

15:09.354 --> 15:12.631
You told the officers that you were home all day watching TV.

15:12.697 --> 15:14.423
Can anyone verify that?

15:14.677 --> 15:16.517
I had a bunch of friends over.

15:16.619 --> 15:18.079
We were watching the game.

15:19.697 --> 15:21.693
I can give you their names.

15:21.898 --> 15:22.681
All right.

15:23.066 --> 15:26.148
I think that'll probably end this.

15:26.224 --> 15:29.758
We just want to find out what really happened, Greg, you understand?

15:30.736 --> 15:31.744
Me, too.

15:33.111 --> 15:36.296
It's just so hard to even imagine Isabel taking her own life.

15:37.473 --> 15:40.525
It's just so not who she is.

15:45.168 --> 15:45.994
What's this?

15:46.109 --> 15:48.509
Those are the tire tracks I told you that we found.

15:49.603 --> 15:52.941
Greg, in order to completely eliminate you as a suspect,

15:53.075 --> 15:55.210
I'd like your permission to take a look at your tires--

15:55.296 --> 15:58.681
compare the treads, maybe get a soil sample off the rubber.

15:59.054 --> 16:00.197
Absolutely not.

16:00.309 --> 16:02.690
Wait a minute. You still think I did this?

16:02.787 --> 16:04.645
We have to rule everybody out.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.802
As soon as we can determine you absolutely weren't there,

16:06.878 --> 16:08.781
we can move on to finding out who was.

16:08.961 --> 16:11.292
There is no way on God's green Earth that I'm going to let you

16:11.338 --> 16:13.533
examine my son's car without a search warrant.

16:13.810 --> 16:15.679
Go ahead. Do what you got to do.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.445
Like I said, get a warrant.

16:17.528 --> 16:18.187
Larry...

16:18.275 --> 16:20.238
You know as well as I do no judge will sign one,

16:20.298 --> 16:23.989
because you have no reason whatsoever to suspect that my son

16:24.061 --> 16:27.819
had anything to do with the tragic death of this disturbed young woman.

16:27.911 --> 16:29.341
No, we are not doing that.

16:29.523 --> 16:31.064
Not here, not today.

16:31.347 --> 16:33.323
We're not talking about her that way.

16:34.486 --> 16:37.465
I know it's the lawyer in you, but...

16:39.262 --> 16:40.118
No.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.068
I loved her, and she is not...

16:48.325 --> 16:49.415
she's not...

16:51.410 --> 16:52.451
was not...

16:53.425 --> 16:54.453
disturbed.

17:00.997 --> 17:01.927
I'm sorry.

17:03.004 --> 17:04.329
I  apologize.

17:05.071 --> 17:07.974
- But, Greg, as your attorney...
- But you're not just my attorney.

17:12.753 --> 17:14.770
And I have nothing to hide.

17:44.723 --> 17:46.180
You're back from lunch so soon?

17:48.327 --> 17:50.830
Surmising from the look on your face, you didn't get a Happy Meal.

17:57.922 --> 17:58.843
What are you doing?

18:00.550 --> 18:02.130
I'm starting a terrorist cell.

18:03.563 --> 18:04.894
What does it look like I'm doing?

18:04.992 --> 18:06.973
I'm organizing a company softball team.

18:20.824 --> 18:21.939
What's the deal?

18:22.804 --> 18:23.895
You going to ask me out?

18:28.155 --> 18:29.440
I don't think it's going to work.

18:29.799 --> 18:33.450
Breasts are sort of a non-negotiable item for me. You know?

18:35.052 --> 18:38.810
All I'm trying to say is no boobs is a real deal breaker.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.207
I need to tell you something, Brett.

18:44.596 --> 18:46.669
This is something I've never told anyone.

18:49.054 --> 18:53.198
It's about me. It's about how I am.

18:55.374 --> 18:58.031
I was just kidding about the breasts thing.

18:59.531 --> 19:02.542
If you do have them, then feel free to keep them to yourself.

19:04.636 --> 19:05.937
I have this thing...

19:07.395 --> 19:09.526
where I can see the future.

19:11.195 --> 19:14.220
Nobody knows about it. I've never told anyone.

19:16.930 --> 19:19.393
You're really starting to creep me out, man.

19:20.646 --> 19:22.729
And I had this vision...

19:23.248 --> 19:28.398
this dream, and you were in that shirt, and you were dying.

19:29.453 --> 19:31.880
You were having a heart attack and you were dying.

19:35.202 --> 19:36.038
Dead.

19:39.299 --> 19:43.257
I want you to do something for me. I want you to go to a doctor... right now.

19:43.435 --> 19:45.084
I'll take you. I'll pay for it.

19:45.386 --> 19:46.523
You're kidding, right?

19:46.645 --> 19:47.629
Come on, I'll take you right now.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.224
Get your hands off of me.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.169
Come on, think about it for a second. What's the harm?

19:53.272 --> 19:55.032
I mean, can you actually go to a doctor too much?

19:55.106 --> 19:57.255
- Come on, let me take you.
- No, Joe!

19:58.181 --> 20:00.045
And stop looking at me like that.

20:01.423 --> 20:04.514
Don't take this the wrong way, but if there's anyone here who needs to see a doctor,

20:04.596 --> 20:06.434
I seriously suspect it's you.

20:06.522 --> 20:07.522
- Please.
- No.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.946
I can see you're serious about this, and...

20:11.575 --> 20:13.618
I love that you're serious about this, but...

20:14.358 --> 20:16.505
I'm not going anyplace but home.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.622
He'll be here any minute. You all right?

20:26.246 --> 20:28.804
To be honest, I'm confused.

20:29.476 --> 20:30.637
Welcome to the club.

20:31.283 --> 20:33.755
I know that that boy didn't push her off the cliff.

20:37.599 --> 20:39.766
Sorry. We had people at the house.

20:40.519 --> 20:42.638
Greg is planning a memorial.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.643
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you a second time,

20:45.733 --> 20:48.379
but I'm afraid there's been a little glitch in the mix.

20:48.630 --> 20:51.164
Greg, we ran those tests we told you about on the car.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.520
They came back positive.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.373
Your tires matched the tire tracks at the scene.

20:55.515 --> 20:56.832
That's not possible.

20:56.959 --> 20:59.811
And forensics found traces of a soil embedded on your car

20:59.908 --> 21:03.749
that matches the soil samples taken from the overlook.

21:11.631 --> 21:12.683
The tests are wrong.

21:13.004 --> 21:14.674
- Run another test.
- Larry, you know as well as...

21:14.769 --> 21:19.758
Look, for every underpaid forensic expert that you trot out of the State's crime lab,

21:19.841 --> 21:23.759
I'll get three expensive credible experts of my own.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.165
Is this a case you really want to try?

21:26.430 --> 21:29.606
Greg... do you understand the implications of what I just told you?

21:29.723 --> 21:32.365
You do not have permission to address my son.

21:32.478 --> 21:35.913
Your son is well over the age of majority. Don't need your permission. Sorry.

21:36.010 --> 21:36.855
Greg?

21:39.896 --> 21:42.548
But I was home. Isabel called me there.

21:42.784 --> 21:45.995
You know. You said that you had the records.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.837
But that only proves she talked to someone. It doesn't prove she talked to you.

21:48.938 --> 21:50.127
I was with my friends.

21:50.382 --> 21:51.683
I will give you their names.

21:51.787 --> 21:53.971
And I promise you we will interview each and every one,

21:54.050 --> 21:58.611
but that does not change the fact that your car was at that overlook.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.353
I mean, unless you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt

22:02.517 --> 22:04.299
that the car was not in your possession,

22:04.432 --> 22:08.288
that you had loaned it to someone or perhaps it was stolen.

22:13.903 --> 22:15.005
We're done here.

22:44.079 --> 22:45.105
Come on, Greg.

22:45.313 --> 22:47.972
Mr. Watt, don't you have something to add here?

22:48.076 --> 22:49.571
Did  you not hear, young woman?

22:50.252 --> 22:52.068
This interview is over.

22:52.181 --> 22:53.564
- Larry, there's...
- Mr. District Attorney,

22:53.626 --> 22:57.951
my son has endured all the questioning that we are prepared to entertain this evening.

22:58.162 --> 23:01.127
Now, if you truly consider him a suspect,

23:01.217 --> 23:03.507
I presume that you have a warrant for his arrest?

23:05.350 --> 23:08.556
Ah. And since you don't, we're leaving.

23:08.665 --> 23:09.297
Greg...

23:09.755 --> 23:12.226
It wasn't your son I was questioning-- it was you.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.310
You know who was in that car. You both do.

23:14.526 --> 23:15.186
Greg.

23:17.019 --> 23:19.420
You weren't in that car at all, were you?

23:21.765 --> 23:23.900
Well, he said his battery was dead.

23:24.017 --> 23:24.787
Greg.

23:25.606 --> 23:27.757
You told me you were going to the office.

23:30.398 --> 23:32.302
- Son...
- Dad?

23:33.403 --> 23:34.719
What's going on?

23:48.694 --> 23:51.089
If you give me a moment outside with my son,

23:52.060 --> 23:53.811
I'm prepared to make a statement,

23:53.893 --> 23:56.771
and to tell you what I know about the death of Isabel Galvan.

24:03.221 --> 24:04.984
I met her one night. Uh...

24:06.934 --> 24:10.564
There's a bar near my practice. I stop in there sometimes.

24:12.756 --> 24:14.200
She approached me.

24:15.158 --> 24:17.518
I bought her a drink, we started talking.

24:19.111 --> 24:22.889
At the time, I had no idea that she was involved with my son.

24:28.101 --> 24:30.260
We had sex in the back of my car.

24:36.949 --> 24:39.995
A week later, she called me. She told me that...

24:40.108 --> 24:42.134
she knew who I was the whole time,

24:42.840 --> 24:44.459
that she had targeted me,

24:45.677 --> 24:48.145
even recorded our encounter together.

24:49.594 --> 24:53.803
She said that unless I gave her $15,000, she would play the tape for Greg.

24:54.168 --> 24:55.846
So when did this happen?

24:55.959 --> 24:57.223
The demand, I mean.

24:59.251 --> 25:00.946
The night before-- Friday.

25:02.671 --> 25:06.112
She very thoughtfully gave me a day to put the money together.

25:08.262 --> 25:12.287
The point is, my son is an innocent in all this.

25:13.086 --> 25:15.819
He doesn't know anything about what this woman was up to,

25:16.956 --> 25:18.855
or my indiscretion with her.

25:20.064 --> 25:21.845
So now it's Saturday.

25:22.224 --> 25:24.897
I agreed to meet Isabel at the overlook.

25:25.304 --> 25:29.265
I just wanted her out of my life. I wanted her out of my son's life. I...

25:31.499 --> 25:35.183
But when I tried to hand over the cash, she refused to give me the tape.

25:35.885 --> 25:38.087
All of a sudden, she didn't want the money.

25:39.149 --> 25:42.316
She said she had changed her mind. She was going to tell Greg everything.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.009
A shakedown? For more money?

25:46.170 --> 25:48.594
So I told her that was all she was going to get out of me.

25:49.796 --> 25:51.046
We argued.

25:52.951 --> 25:53.939
She, uh...

25:55.408 --> 25:56.786
She came at me.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.365
I urged her again to take the money, but she refused.

26:01.218 --> 26:04.164
When I realized that we weren't getting anywhere, I left.

26:07.328 --> 26:09.601
I swear to you she was still alive.

26:20.907 --> 26:22.539
Hey, you.

26:25.745 --> 26:27.947
I'm sorry I got in so late last night.

26:28.006 --> 26:30.394
- You're not gonna believe what happened.
- I really don't want to hear it.

26:35.022 --> 26:36.148
So...

26:37.542 --> 26:40.310
So yesterday I told a doctor of mathematics--

26:41.365 --> 26:44.944
a man I've worked side by side with since I can't remember when...

26:46.670 --> 26:50.126
a man whose intellect I've always respected

26:51.774 --> 26:55.615
and who, I believe, up until yesterday, respected mine--

26:56.823 --> 26:59.941
that I, Joseph Dubois,

27:00.550 --> 27:02.291
can see the future.

27:06.454 --> 27:08.523
And that his days were numbered.

27:14.452 --> 27:16.858
And did you suggest that he see a doctor?

27:17.232 --> 27:18.333
Yes, indeed,

27:19.004 --> 27:21.128
and he urged me to do the same,

27:22.191 --> 27:27.518
just before he fled the room with a look of abject terror on his face.

27:29.474 --> 27:30.431
I see.

27:40.152 --> 27:43.083
So initial here, here, here and here.

27:43.625 --> 27:44.920
Sorry we're late, gentlemen.

27:45.095 --> 27:48.582
Sorry to make you come to me, Manuel, but I've got trial in 20 minutes.

27:49.181 --> 27:51.997
Hey, somebody apologize to me. I'm the one who's surrendering.

27:52.150 --> 27:53.272
It's merely a formality.

27:53.426 --> 27:56.466
Your son and I both know you're innocent. You're gonna be back home this afternoon.

27:56.703 --> 27:59.098
Nevertheless, we appreciate your cooperation.

27:59.226 --> 28:00.255
Duly noted.

28:00.723 --> 28:02.903
Greg, sign here.

28:07.009 --> 28:09.523
Okay, Greg, you've got power of attorney now.

28:09.794 --> 28:13.342
I'm counting on you to take charge of everything until this mess is cleaned up.

28:13.696 --> 28:16.476
But I don't know anything about this stuff, Dad.

28:16.568 --> 28:18.150
It's money. You'll figure it out.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.357
Besides, it's only temporary.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.420
It's not as if they actually have a case.

28:22.712 --> 28:25.242
Let's just let the judge take a look at everything.

28:25.334 --> 28:26.722
And I'll tell you what he'll see.

28:27.258 --> 28:29.779
He'll see a man who exercised bad judgment,

28:29.870 --> 28:32.844
made a horrible mistake and was blackmailed for it.

28:32.931 --> 28:33.510
Larry.

28:33.634 --> 28:37.956
Blackmailed by an unstable woman, who, according to my investigators,

28:38.031 --> 28:41.799
has been prescribed with antidepressants since her preteens,

28:42.061 --> 28:44.180
has a history of suicidal behavior.

28:44.872 --> 28:49.049
She apparently called suicide hotlines the way other people call out for Chinese food.

28:55.002 --> 28:56.152
Was that true?

28:56.771 --> 28:58.942
Well, it may be true, but...

28:59.935 --> 29:02.019
that's not the girl that I know.

29:02.669 --> 29:04.533
That's not the girl that I loved.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.171
Do you think she jumped?

29:07.405 --> 29:09.500
I honestly have no idea.

29:09.991 --> 29:12.960
The only thing I'm certain of at this point is,

29:13.057 --> 29:15.310
I know my father didn't push her.

29:15.637 --> 29:17.118
Deputies are waiting outside.

29:23.415 --> 29:26.974
Sorry I'm late. My wife had an emergency at her job and the kids...

29:52.407 --> 29:53.435
Kreskin.

29:56.993 --> 29:58.806
I got to work-- you weren't there.

29:59.769 --> 30:01.673
One of the guys said you were here.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.990
8:00 last night.

30:19.439 --> 30:21.210
I'm cleaning my place...

30:22.789 --> 30:26.883
and I have this extraordinary moment of clarity.

30:28.419 --> 30:30.508
So I rush back to the lab,

30:31.813 --> 30:33.044
and I'm working.

30:35.994 --> 30:37.579
And I feel this...

30:38.511 --> 30:41.926
twinge in my chest,

30:44.337 --> 30:46.663
and I was thinking about what you said,

30:48.532 --> 30:49.607
and so...

30:54.814 --> 30:57.588
I was compelled to call 911.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.660
They told me I was flatlining in the ambulance.

31:09.647 --> 31:11.874
Quadruple bypass.

31:13.984 --> 31:14.971
God.

31:30.003 --> 31:32.707
...where she interviewed everyone who had ever attempted

31:32.763 --> 31:35.718
to kill themselves by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge,

31:35.984 --> 31:38.944
and it turns out every single person she interviewed...

31:39.126 --> 31:40.433
every single one,

31:40.720 --> 31:44.672
confessed that after they threw themselves off that bridge,

31:45.016 --> 31:47.350
about two-thirds of the way down,

31:47.468 --> 31:51.570
it suddenly occurred to them that all the seemingly insurmountable problems

31:51.667 --> 31:53.110
that they had in their lives

31:53.433 --> 31:54.523
were fixable,

31:54.903 --> 31:56.249
every single one...

31:57.201 --> 32:01.600
save for the fact that they had just thrown themselves off the Golden Gate Bridge.

32:04.325 --> 32:09.253
When we come back, more from Henry Salzman, Director of the Greater Phoenix Suicide Hotline.

32:12.602 --> 32:13.576
Can I help you?

32:13.830 --> 32:16.816
Yes. I work with the District Attorney's office.

32:16.959 --> 32:20.778
We're doing an investigation on the death of a young woman named Isabel Galvan.

32:21.189 --> 32:24.194
I was wondering if you could tell me if she ever called the hotline here?

32:24.317 --> 32:26.401
I'm sorry, but all calls to the hotline are confidential.

32:26.519 --> 32:28.875
- Yes, I know, but... 
- I'm sorry. I can't help you.

32:28.977 --> 32:31.019
- Sandra, line two.
- Excuse me.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.879
Not the girl I know.

32:50.140 --> 32:52.027
Not the girl I loved.

33:10.039 --> 33:11.279
Bad dream?

33:13.044 --> 33:14.801
No, actually. No dreams.

33:14.887 --> 33:17.827
Just a nagging feeling that something isn't right.

33:22.066 --> 33:23.571
Why are you smiling?

33:24.841 --> 33:26.409
This whole Brett thing.

33:27.724 --> 33:30.271
I was just thinking how funny it all was.

33:31.291 --> 33:35.983
Here I had myself all in a twist 'cause I thought I was delivering the guy his death sentence,

33:37.223 --> 33:39.731
but as it turned out, I probably,

33:39.889 --> 33:41.994
we probably, saved his life.

33:45.561 --> 33:49.070
And I'm sorry I behaved like such an ass yesterday.

33:53.151 --> 33:56.437
So what's not right? And what's keeping you awake?

33:57.506 --> 34:00.380
Finding that kid's picture at the suicide hotline?

34:00.687 --> 34:02.218
That doesn't prove anything.

34:02.367 --> 34:05.756
Yeah, but Watt said that Isabel called hotlines all the time.

34:05.883 --> 34:07.325
There has to be a connection.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.795
Okay, well, it all began with that dream you had, right?

34:09.868 --> 34:13.641
So, let's start there and work forward from that.

34:14.205 --> 34:15.795
Well, that's just it.

34:16.297 --> 34:18.152
In my dream, she jumped.

34:19.058 --> 34:22.678
There was no foul play. She clearly committed suicide.

34:23.072 --> 34:25.996
Girl walks to the edge of a cliff and jumps.

34:26.963 --> 34:28.054
You're right.

34:29.125 --> 34:32.202
Nothing much open to interpretation there.

34:33.206 --> 34:34.094
Yeah.

34:35.596 --> 34:37.094
Yeah, I know.

34:38.641 --> 34:39.896
I see her--

34:41.478 --> 34:42.670
she's upset.

34:47.612 --> 34:48.857
Wait a second.

34:50.164 --> 34:52.687
And why is it exactly that we're looking for her cell phone?

34:53.061 --> 34:55.175
Because that's what she keeps showing to me.

34:55.329 --> 34:57.668
At least I think that's what she keeps showing to me.

34:57.854 --> 35:00.249
I got it! I found it!

35:01.262 --> 35:04.611
Me, too. I found it, too.

35:12.302 --> 35:13.342
Gentlemen.

35:18.190 --> 35:19.230
What's going on?

35:19.716 --> 35:22.511
You said I didn't need my attorney. You said you had good news.

35:22.706 --> 35:23.837
I believe I do.

35:24.344 --> 35:25.296
Of a sort.

35:26.537 --> 35:29.935
We went back to the scene this morning to retrieve Isabel's cell phone,

35:30.216 --> 35:31.278
which we did,

35:32.085 --> 35:33.146
along with this.

35:40.913 --> 35:42.787
Get off me!

35:43.104 --> 35:45.306
Damn it, I think you drew blood.

35:45.439 --> 35:48.440
- That's you.
- Just leave, okay? I'm not taking the money.

35:48.510 --> 35:50.498
I'm telling him everything and you can't stop me.

35:50.594 --> 35:51.532
And that's Isabel.

35:51.644 --> 35:53.636
You're messing with the wrong man, young lady--

35:54.139 --> 35:55.490
I'll bury you.

35:55.746 --> 35:57.802
Those words were spoken in the heat of the moment.

35:57.916 --> 35:58.894
I had no intention of...

36:01.797 --> 36:03.358
And that's you driving away.

36:10.476 --> 36:12.381
And that's Isabel dialing the phone.

36:12.466 --> 36:14.422
When you left, Isabel was alive.

36:14.557 --> 36:15.785
I've advised the court.

36:15.881 --> 36:17.188
We're dropping all charges.

36:20.695 --> 36:21.770
Thank God.

36:23.158 --> 36:24.156
Thank you.

36:24.920 --> 36:29.389
This is fabulous. The recorder she used to blackmail me proves that I didn't kill her.

36:30.117 --> 36:31.443
Pick up, pick up.

36:33.019 --> 36:35.390
She's calling you, Greg. Remember that call?

36:36.623 --> 36:38.436
Can we turn this off now?

36:38.734 --> 36:39.655
Sure thing.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.950
Have a seat. We're not through.

36:44.923 --> 36:48.056
But... what's left to talk about?

36:48.365 --> 36:49.838
Well, there's the truth.

36:51.262 --> 36:52.599
I don't understand.

36:53.014 --> 36:56.013
Did you know that your son volunteered at a suicide hotline?

36:56.070 --> 36:57.631
The same one that Isabel used to call?

36:58.624 --> 37:00.432
Greg has a very giving spirit.

37:00.631 --> 37:03.243
Actually, what Greg had was a plan.

37:03.678 --> 37:06.678
And in order for his plan to work, he needed someone.

37:07.472 --> 37:10.037
Someone that he could control and manipulate.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.464
So he volunteered,

37:12.679 --> 37:15.506
he started taking calls from the lonely and the desperate,

37:15.669 --> 37:20.045
and finally, one night, he got a call from someone who fit the profile of what he needed.

37:20.518 --> 37:21.715
It was Isabel.

37:22.479 --> 37:24.071
Greg saved her life that night.

37:24.165 --> 37:26.390
He told her he liked the sound of her voice.

37:26.498 --> 37:28.285
That it was against the rules, but couldn't they meet?

37:28.382 --> 37:30.834
Perhaps we could meet in person.

37:31.076 --> 37:32.258
And she agreed.

37:32.806 --> 37:34.941
Greg made her feel special.

37:35.638 --> 37:39.155
For the first time in her life, she felt loved.

37:39.631 --> 37:42.882
And after a few short months, he became her entire world.

37:43.154 --> 37:45.831
So, when he told her to seduce his father...

37:48.427 --> 37:50.824
to record it and use it to blackmail him,

37:51.479 --> 37:52.419
she did it.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.613
So he had everything set up for the big day.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.286
You invited friends over to give you an alibi,

38:00.376 --> 38:03.992
you made sure your father's car was out of commission so he'd have to borrow yours.

38:04.995 --> 38:06.752
And just like you told her to,

38:06.865 --> 38:11.251
the dutiful Isabel refused the payoff money and provoked a fight.

38:11.375 --> 38:14.237
And then, like a good girl,

38:14.499 --> 38:16.732
she called you to tell you about it.

38:18.804 --> 38:21.533
Greg? Hey, baby, it's me.

38:22.445 --> 38:23.956
Yeah, your dad just left.

38:24.411 --> 38:26.367
Yeah, he went for it.

38:27.047 --> 38:28.778
I taped the whole thing for you.

38:30.773 --> 38:33.135
He was really mad, I thought he was going to kill me.

38:33.637 --> 38:35.573
And that's when you turned on her.

38:36.699 --> 38:38.388
You called her a whore.

38:39.910 --> 38:42.926
What-what are you saying? You told me you needed me to...

38:43.068 --> 38:44.861
You told her it was a test,

38:44.998 --> 38:47.758
a test to see if she loved you and she failed.

38:47.994 --> 38:48.983
Stop!

38:50.698 --> 38:52.286
What are you saying?

38:52.397 --> 38:54.650
You knew every button to push.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.205
You told her you wished you'd never met her.

38:57.297 --> 39:00.072
You wished you hadn't picked up that call that night at the hotline.

39:00.221 --> 39:01.957
You wished she was dead.

39:02.279 --> 39:04.480
Greg, please, don't.

39:05.427 --> 39:06.921
I love you.

39:11.992 --> 39:14.694
You knew you could get her to jump.

39:15.263 --> 39:16.717
And you were right.

39:17.066 --> 39:19.835
All the time making it look like your father killed her

39:19.881 --> 39:21.597
so you could get Power of Attorney

39:21.812 --> 39:23.389
and control of his money.

39:27.303 --> 39:28.707
I'm truly sorry, Larry.

39:30.055 --> 39:31.048
Dad...

39:32.625 --> 39:33.880
They're lying.

39:40.910 --> 39:42.450
Dad, it was all Isabel's idea.

39:42.518 --> 39:44.617
She told me that we could be together and I believed her.

39:44.724 --> 39:45.907
- Dad...
- Young man.

39:48.795 --> 39:50.330
I have a warrant for your arrest.

39:54.432 --> 39:59.147
Yeah? Well, you're gonna have a tough time proving any of it,

39:59.962 --> 40:01.376
and even if you could,

40:02.035 --> 40:03.597
I didn't kill her, so...

40:03.714 --> 40:07.304
the worst you could get me on is conspiracy to blackmail?

40:08.630 --> 40:09.874
Maybe you're right.

40:10.944 --> 40:15.020
But even so, I'm going to tie up your life and make it a living hell.

40:15.147 --> 40:16.770
You're going to spend so much time in court,

40:16.872 --> 40:19.310
the bailiffs are going to want to make you shop steward,

40:19.843 --> 40:22.336
and by the time I'm done with you, trust me,

40:22.701 --> 40:25.454
you're going to wish you threw yourself off a cliff.

40:40.067 --> 40:40.779
Hey.

40:41.321 --> 40:42.048
Hey.

40:43.985 --> 40:45.176
Kids are asleep.

40:45.996 --> 40:47.476
If they weren't...

40:48.755 --> 40:49.959
heads would roll.

41:00.895 --> 41:02.191
Are you all right?

41:05.555 --> 41:07.003
Piece of plaque.

41:08.053 --> 41:09.681
Size of a tiny crumb.

41:11.479 --> 41:12.745
In his blood.

41:14.355 --> 41:15.175
Went to his heart.

41:19.020 --> 41:21.099
I realized later on that you knew.

41:21.355 --> 41:24.074
This morning... in bed, you knew.

41:27.024 --> 41:29.205
That's why you didn't say anything when I was going on and on

41:29.256 --> 41:31.295
about how well things worked out.

41:32.312 --> 41:33.296
I just...

41:33.412 --> 41:34.703
I didn't know where.

41:35.523 --> 41:36.848
I didn't know when.

41:37.883 --> 41:38.862
I just...

41:40.572 --> 41:43.050
I didn't want to do it to you twice,

41:44.729 --> 41:45.938
that's all.

42:22.278 --> 42:25.840
If we could only get from there to there...

42:26.845 --> 42:29.134
That would be something, hmm?

42:30.839 --> 42:32.912
Son of a bitch.

42:34.731 --> 42:36.210
Think they'll publish it?

42:39.509 --> 42:40.495
I hope so.

42:41.331 --> 42:44.167
Maybe he'll get his little piece of eternity after all.
