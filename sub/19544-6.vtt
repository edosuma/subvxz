00:08.592 --> 00:11.504
Goku is coming back from
the Next World for one day

00:11.720 --> 00:15.588
so he can enter the Tenkaichi Budokai.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.641
Piccolo and Vegeta's
fighting spirits are surging

00:18.852 --> 00:21.639
over the first chance to fight
after a long absence,

00:21.855 --> 00:24.562
anol Kuririn and No. 18,
who have been living a peaceful life,

00:24.775 --> 00:27.608
have also decided to enter the tournament.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.853
All right, how about we get started?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.610
Yeah!

00:33.826 --> 00:36.317
With a month remaining until the tournament,

00:36.537 --> 00:40.826
Gohan plunges into a
training stint with Goten.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.408
Say, is it okay if I become
like you, too, Big Brother?

00:44.628 --> 00:46.789
That "Super Saiyan" thing?

00:49.925 --> 00:53.042
Goten's talents are astounding!

00:53.262 --> 00:57.255
So much so that Gohan
cannot afford to sit still.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.726
Big Brother! If you're going to fly,

00:59.935 --> 01:02.426
you have to teach me how, too, or it isn't fair!

01:02.646 --> 01:05.558
All right, all right! Don't get angry!

01:05.774 --> 01:08.436
Goten, l'll teach you how to fly!

01:08.652 --> 01:10.517
Wow! Hooray!

01:12.489 --> 01:16.107
And then, Videl came barging in, as well.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.703
You promised to teach me how to fly, right?!

01:18.912 --> 01:21.403
Uh, of course I'll teach you.

01:21.623 --> 01:26.993
And so, Gohan's special training
in how to fly begins.

"Gohan the Teacher!
Videl's Flying Technique Tutorial."

03:10.649 --> 03:13.265
Okay, I'm going to teach you two Bukujutsu,

03:13.485 --> 03:16.943
which is to say, how to soar through the air.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.488
This is a matter of Ki control,

03:20.701 --> 03:23.659
so it is not all that difficult a matter.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.614
N-Now, if you want to fly at great speeds,

03:28.834 --> 03:31.166
then that can be harder, in its own way.

03:31.378 --> 03:35.542
Ki control? Hey, what is Ki?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.213
What's Ki?

03:37.426 --> 03:39.462
Oh, right, maybe you call it
something different

03:39.678 --> 03:41.714
where you come from.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.718
You know, the energy, or power,
that lies hidden inside your body.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.643
Huh? What do you mean? Hidden power?

03:50.647 --> 03:55.186
Huh, that's a toughie.
How can I explain it to you?

03:56.862 --> 03:58.398
He's talking about this.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.361
Yeah, yeah, that's the power I mean.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.954
Oh, I see...

04:10.167 --> 04:13.204
What do you guys call KI?

04:16.048 --> 04:17.379
Tricks, I think.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.503
Tricks? This is completely different from tricks.

04:20.719 --> 04:21.959
It isn't a gimmick.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.168
Then to be honest with you,

04:23.388 --> 04:25.845
I don't know anything about
any such magic-like power!

04:26.058 --> 04:30.722
Huh, you don't know about KI?
What do we do about that?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.680
Listen, are you saying that if
I don't have any Ki, I can't fly?

04:33.899 --> 04:38.484
l-lt's all right, it's all right.
Ki is something everyone has.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.028
Controlling it is the only hard part.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.025
ReaHy?

04:43.241 --> 04:44.321
Yeah, really.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.116
Goten, give me a little while
before I teach you Bukujutsu.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.571
l have to teach Videl-san how to use
her Ki first, so we'll do it after that.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.453
Maybe it's too much for her. She doesn't
even know what "Ki" means, right?

04:53.669 --> 04:56.206
l-l'll learn!

04:56.421 --> 04:58.958
It's okay, just go play somewhere.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.789
Okay, I'll go play!

05:01.009 --> 05:02.545
Hurry and teach me to fly, okay?

05:02.761 --> 05:04.251
Yeah!

05:09.059 --> 05:12.392
Ready? Be still and relax...

05:14.648 --> 05:18.482
Slowly, draw out the power within you.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.417
You see?

05:44.803 --> 05:47.294
Okay, you try it.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.595
Be still and relax...

06:21.214 --> 06:23.876
No, no, don't strain. You have to relax,

06:24.092 --> 06:26.925
or you can't draw out your Ki.
You have to focus.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.760
--Thank you for this meal!
--Thank you for this meal!

06:37.773 --> 06:40.105
Thank you for offering me lunch.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.477
What other choice is there?

06:41.693 --> 06:44.526
It's not like we can let you be
the only one not eatin', after all.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.567
Ah, this is delicious.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.900
Much more delicious than
the cooks at my home make.

06:51.119 --> 06:55.613
Cooks?! Oh, does your family run a restaurant?

06:55.832 --> 06:59.290
No, I mean the cooks we have
on staff at my home.

06:59.503 --> 07:03.997
You have cooks on staff?
Are you tellin' me your family is rich?!

07:04.216 --> 07:08.050
How many rooms does your
house have?! Ten?! Twenty?!

07:08.261 --> 07:11.253
Hmm, how many is it...?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.842
It's about fifty, I think.

07:14.059 --> 07:17.677
Fifty?! You guys are stinkin' rich, aren't you?!

07:19.481 --> 07:21.142
This really is delicious.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.895
When are you two gettin' married?!

07:27.781 --> 07:31.069
Are Big Brother and Videl-san getting married?

07:31.284 --> 07:34.367
Whoa, no, no, no! No, | tell you!

07:59.020 --> 08:01.397
Yes, yes, that's the way.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.411
Yes, yes, that's it! That is your Ki.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.207
Sure enough, since you do martial arts,

08:23.420 --> 08:26.378
you're quick to get the hang of it, Videl-san.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.962
So tell me, can I fly now?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.889
That's still too much for you.

08:38.101 --> 08:42.265
First you have to get so you
can control your Ki at will.

08:58.622 --> 09:03.161
Looks like you're doing a little
old-fashioned training, huh?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.833
Oh, Kaio of the South.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.832
Long time no see.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.835
So that's Son Goku, one of the
top two most capable fighters

09:11.051 --> 09:13.133
in the northern area, is it?

09:17.933 --> 09:21.846
How heavy are those weights
you have him wearing?

09:22.062 --> 09:26.180
Oh, nothing too fancy.
Each one is just two tons.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.481
T-Two tons?

09:30.487 --> 09:33.570
Hm-hm, you seem surprised by that.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.486
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not surprised.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.160
This is Papoi, who comes
from the southern area.

09:41.373 --> 09:45.366
He's the greatest hero from
the last 2,000 years in my area.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.791
He's incredibly strong.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.166
Compared to him,
your boy is nothing special at all.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.419
What do you say? There's a martial arts
tournament coming up

09:53.635 --> 09:57.127
on a planet called "Earth,"
and he's making a special entry.

09:57.347 --> 10:01.010
Why not let Papoi-kun enter, as well?

10:01.226 --> 10:03.467
Sounds good.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.053
You'll definitely be freaked out!

10:06.273 --> 10:08.980
There's no question that he will win it all!

10:12.320 --> 10:13.730
Hey, Goku!

10:13.947 --> 10:17.155
You want to try changing to
weights that are a little heavier?

10:18.618 --> 10:21.451
Yeah, sure, but how much
heavier are you making them?

10:21.663 --> 10:24.700
Ah, good question. You want to try ten tons?

10:24.916 --> 10:27.623
T-Ten tons, you say? Y-You're kidding, right?

10:28.628 --> 10:32.621
Ten tons? No, I think that might be
a little too much, even for me.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.547
I ain't gonna be able to move!

10:37.053 --> 10:38.668
That's right, that's right!

10:38.888 --> 10:40.753
I don't care who you are, that's crazy!

10:40.974 --> 10:44.808
| see you still like those unfunny
jokes of yours, Kaio of the North.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.934
Goku, you're free to turn Super Saiyan.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.984
Oh, in that case, no problem at all.

10:54.195 --> 10:58.564
Kaio of the South, you go ahead
and change his weights to ten tons.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.776
T-Ten tons! That will add up
to a total of 40 tons!

11:02.996 --> 11:05.328
I'm really going to do it! Are you ready?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.041
Yeah.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.416
I really, really will do it!

11:13.631 --> 11:14.541
Just do it already.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.340
Don't blame me if you break anything!

11:17.552 --> 11:22.421
Oh, round and round! Ten tons, bah!

11:36.988 --> 11:39.479
Nyah-hah!

11:45.705 --> 11:49.414
The martial arts tournament
is in 28 days, Earth time.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.834
Papoi-kun, you should be eager to enter.

11:54.547 --> 11:59.166
O-On second thought,
Papoi finds such tournaments to be dull.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.718
Now, let's think good and hard about this.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.761
It's probably best not to enter, huh?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.350
Not some two-bit tournament like that.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.902
Now then, as for how to fly--

12:24.119 --> 12:25.780
you have to have good control...

12:25.995 --> 12:29.704
...of your Ki, like I taught you earlier...
for you to float...

12:39.175 --> 12:42.793
You don't spring about;
you loosen your whole body up...

12:43.805 --> 12:45.670
...and focus your Ki...

13:03.992 --> 13:07.405
Wah! L-Like this?!

13:07.620 --> 13:10.327
Oh! Way to go, way to go!

13:10.540 --> 13:13.202
Yay! I'm floating, l'm floating!

13:15.795 --> 13:18.036
You're doing great, Goten!

13:21.384 --> 13:22.794
Goten, don't overdo it!

13:23.011 --> 13:25.297
It's all right, Big Brother!

13:26.931 --> 13:28.432
Goten!

13:29.809 --> 13:32.516
Goten, I told you not to overdo it.

13:32.729 --> 13:36.096
But that's all right. You'll be able
to fly freely soon enough.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.683
Uh-huh. By the way, Big Brother,
what about our special training?

13:39.903 --> 13:43.145
Shh! We'll do it after Videl-san leaves.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.980
Once she's gone, we'll train a lot.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.691
Uh-huh!

13:55.877 --> 13:59.210
Gohan-kun! What about me?!

13:59.422 --> 14:01.913
Oh, right, right, right, right! Right! Right!

14:02.133 --> 14:04.840
Incidentally, it's getting awfully late.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.759
Won't your father be worried?

14:06.971 --> 14:09.713
That's okay. Flying is more important.

14:09.933 --> 14:14.927
Hmm. Well, let's keep going.
Um, you need to relax your body more.

14:15.146 --> 14:19.389
Let's see, and then, focus your Ki more...

14:37.585 --> 14:39.997
Mm-hmm, attagirl, attagirl!

14:50.598 --> 14:54.182
You did it! You're floating!
You're floating just a bit!

14:54.394 --> 14:57.431
Shh! Keep quiet! I can't concentrate!

15:08.658 --> 15:10.023
Wasn't that amazing?!

15:10.243 --> 15:12.985
Imagine, being able to float after just one day!

15:13.204 --> 15:14.580
Oh, I don't know...

15:14.789 --> 15:18.532
I did it! I did it! Big Brother, see?!

15:18.751 --> 15:20.457
Look at me! Look at me! Big Brother! Yay!

15:20.670 --> 15:25.289
G-Goten already had complete control
over his Ki when he started.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.373
Videl-san, once you get so you can do that,

15:27.594 --> 15:29.801
the rest will be no problem!

15:30.013 --> 15:32.800
You'll be able to fly like that in no time!

15:36.436 --> 15:37.471
I'm coming back tomorrow.

15:37.687 --> 15:41.350
Eh? W-Why? You can all
but do it already, can't you?

15:41.566 --> 15:43.773
Taking it from here
on your own will be fine.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.317
I want to find out more about Ki.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.360
Or is my being here inconvenient for you?!

15:48.573 --> 15:51.110
No, no, it's not that...

15:52.201 --> 15:54.112
Okay then, tomorrow.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.742
Well, bye.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.540
G-Goodbye.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.243
O-Oh, come to think of it...

16:03.463 --> 16:07.957
--What?
--V-Videl-san, about your hair...

16:08.176 --> 16:12.044
I think it would be better if it were shorter.

16:15.892 --> 16:20.261
G-Gohan-kun, you like girls
with short hair better?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.597
Eh?! N-No, it's not about what I like!

16:23.816 --> 16:27.479
When you're competing, I think
shorter hair gives you an edge.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.651
You know, long hair can get in your eyes,

16:29.864 --> 16:32.901
and your opponent can
pull your hair, and so on.

16:33.117 --> 16:37.235
Shut up and leave me alone!
That's up to me to decide, you know!

16:49.342 --> 16:51.082
Why did that lady get mad?

16:51.302 --> 16:53.133
|-| don't know.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.712
Th-Though I've got to say...

16:56.933 --> 17:00.016
Eep! I can't get any training done!

17:00.228 --> 17:01.968
Here I come, Kuririn!

17:02.188 --> 17:04.395
Ah! W-Whoa! Whoa! Hold on!

17:04.607 --> 17:09.692
It's too early in the morning!
I haven't even warmed up yet!

17:10.696 --> 17:12.311
No excuses!

17:15.159 --> 17:19.528
Ho, aren't you full of zip for so
early in the morning, both of you?

17:39.600 --> 17:43.513
Don't overexert yourself, Trunks.
You'd best stay out of the room.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.598
This 150-times gravity is far too much for you.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.308
I got a phone call from Goten-kun last night.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.019
Goten-kun says he's entering
the Tenkaichi Budokai!

17:53.239 --> 17:57.357
So I'm thinking of entering, too!

17:57.577 --> 17:59.909
Hmph, there's a real festive
mood out there, huh?

18:00.121 --> 18:02.533
|-|t's too hard like this, all right.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.489
Time to turn Super Saiyan!

18:04.709 --> 18:06.199
What?!

18:10.631 --> 18:12.132
W-What the--?!

18:12.341 --> 18:15.208
Easy-peasy! Easy-peasy!

18:15.428 --> 18:17.339
S-Since when could he...?

18:17.555 --> 18:19.511
Easy-peasy! Easy-peasy!

18:19.724 --> 18:21.715
Y-You've got to be kidding!

18:21.934 --> 18:26.803
He became a warrior of legend,
a Super Saiyan, as easily as that?!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.063
Trunks!

18:30.276 --> 18:31.641
Yes?

18:31.861 --> 18:35.194
Can Son Gohan's brother turn, too?
Into a Super Saiyan?

18:35.406 --> 18:39.900
--Yes.
--Almost like a Super Saiyan bargain sale, huh?

18:42.288 --> 18:44.199
--Come at me!
--Eh?

18:44.415 --> 18:47.578
I don't care what you say, I can't!
Dad, you're too strong!

18:47.794 --> 18:50.035
Come at me, right now! How about this?

18:50.254 --> 18:52.631
If you can land even one blow on my face,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.341
I'll take you to the amusement park.

18:54.550 --> 18:58.509
Really? You will, Dad?! All right!

18:58.721 --> 19:00.427
Come at me with all you've got! Understand?!

19:00.640 --> 19:02.130
Here | go!

19:16.697 --> 19:20.406
Owch-ch-ch-ch...! That was mean, hitting back!

19:20.618 --> 19:23.325
Don't be a big baby!
I never said I wouldn't hit back.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.449
Aw, man...

19:25.665 --> 19:28.407
D-Don't cry! I'll take you
to the amusement park.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.661
Yay!

19:29.877 --> 19:31.117
Never mind that, tell me!

19:31.337 --> 19:33.999
Who is stronger, you, or Son Gohan's brother?

19:34.215 --> 19:36.297
I'm a little bit stronger.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.047
Goten-kun is a year younger than me,
and he can't fly yet.

19:40.263 --> 19:45.098
Just a little bit?
What the hell is going on here?

20:19.635 --> 20:23.548
W-What a tremendous Ki.
He's been sitting like that since yesterday,

20:23.764 --> 20:26.972
and far from getting weaker,
it's still getting even stronger!

20:27.184 --> 20:28.924
This has to be because Son Goku-san

20:29.145 --> 20:31.352
is entering the Tenkaichi Budokai.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.274
That was delicious!

20:37.486 --> 20:39.351
That was delicious!

20:39.572 --> 20:41.153
Okay, Goten, let's head out!

20:41.365 --> 20:43.105
Uh-huh!

20:43.326 --> 20:44.611
Let's hurry and get some special training in,

20:44.827 --> 20:46.237
before we get interrupted!

20:46.454 --> 20:47.944
Uh-huh!

20:54.921 --> 20:56.411
O-Oh, no!

21:06.057 --> 21:08.799
Big Brother, who is that?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.805
Okay, let's pick up where we left off yesterday.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.728
V-Videl-san...

21:14.941 --> 21:18.058
| just don't get girls.

21:18.277 --> 21:23.067
A good time is being had by Goten
and Trunks, with their hidden potential.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.692
What is mysterious is what Videl,

21:24.909 --> 21:28.322
who has cut her hair dramatically shorter,
is keeping in her heart.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.620
Gohan has hardly a clue.

22:41.736 --> 22:42.942
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.154 --> 22:45.065
Yoo-hoo! Long time no see!

22:45.281 --> 22:47.818
It's been seven years,
so there have been a lot of changes!

22:48.034 --> 22:49.319
How have you been, guys?

22:49.535 --> 22:51.491
Goku-sa! I'm so glad you're back!

22:51.704 --> 22:54.616
Look, Goten! What are you so
bashful about? It's your father!

22:54.832 --> 22:56.072
Father!

22:56.292 --> 22:57.782
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.002 --> 23:01.915
"The Dragon Team Fully Assembled!
Son Goku Has Come Back!!"

23:02.131 --> 23:05.874
We're all about to enter the
Tenkaichi Budokai together!
