00:01.733 --> 00:03.500
[knock on door]

00:03.566 --> 00:04.600
Hey, hey. Something came for me?

00:04.666 --> 00:06.266
Yes.

00:06.333 --> 00:07.700
This lovely package

00:07.766 --> 00:11.100
from the very
exclusive Robere's.

00:11.166 --> 00:13.633
And how do you know
where it's from?

00:13.700 --> 00:17.100
Tracking code 878479,
everyone knows that's Robere's.

00:19.366 --> 00:21.966
I'm impressed, yet frightened.
Bye‐bye.

00:22.033 --> 00:24.300
So, uh.. What is it?

00:25.333 --> 00:26.600
Who is it for?

00:29.066 --> 00:32.466
Well, if you must know,
O Bouncy One..

00:32.533 --> 00:35.333
...it is a silver bracelet,
um, for my mother.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.566
Oh, ooh, oh, well, Kyle, man

00:37.633 --> 00:39.733
the engraver made
a hell of mistake.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.500
'Cause they spelled mom,
"M‐A‐X."

00:44.566 --> 00:46.133
You opened my box?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.166
It fell open

00:48.233 --> 00:50.166
when I tugged on the tape.

00:51.633 --> 00:54.466
So, is this
one of those gifts that says

00:54.533 --> 00:57.800
"I'm sorry we broke up,
let's get naked and reconcile?"

00:57.866 --> 00:59.100
[growls]

00:59.166 --> 01:00.133
[laughing]

01:00.200 --> 01:01.640
Regine, the picture
you're painting for me

01:01.706 --> 01:03.773
is making me queasy
and get off me.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.206
No, I ordered this for Max..

01:06.273 --> 01:09.006
...before we broke up, when
I had more money than sense.

01:09.073 --> 01:11.106
Umm..

01:11.173 --> 01:13.673
And she is never going
to hear about this

01:13.740 --> 01:15.573
right, little short person?

01:17.340 --> 01:19.373
Kyle? I can be discreet..

01:19.440 --> 01:21.640
[laughing]

01:21.706 --> 01:22.640
Woo!

01:22.706 --> 01:23.673
...for a price.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.373
A‐ha, okay.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.973
I merely want
the gold Robere's box.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.140
It lends an air of class
to any gift.

01:31.206 --> 01:34.840
Oh, Regine, do you
honestly think anyone with taste

01:34.906 --> 01:36.506
is gonna think
a gift comes from Robere's

01:36.573 --> 01:38.740
just because you put it in
a little gold box?

01:38.806 --> 01:41.173
[chuckles]
You obviously love the cufflinks

01:41.240 --> 01:43.273
I gave you last Christmas.

01:43.340 --> 01:46.306

I get to your toes?

Oh..

02:34.846 --> 02:36.813
Don't mess with my toes, mama.

02:38.046 --> 02:40.280
Unless you got
a couple of hours to kill.

02:41.546 --> 02:43.813
‐ Get those boots off, daddy.
‐ Sure.

02:44.946 --> 02:46.446
[knock on door]

02:48.180 --> 02:50.146
Oh, don't worry, baby.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.546
‐ I'll get rid of them.
‐ Okay.

02:52.613 --> 02:53.880
‐ Stay right there.
‐ Okay.

02:55.546 --> 02:57.280
Oh, Lord, Uncle Tibby.

02:57.346 --> 02:59.246
Watch out there now!

02:59.313 --> 03:00.820
How's my number one nephew?

03:00.886 --> 03:02.186
[laughing]

03:02.253 --> 03:04.153
What they do,
they kick you out of Cleveland?

03:04.220 --> 03:07.086
Ah, you know I can't
stay cooped up too long.

03:07.153 --> 03:08.753
Every twelve years,
I got to get out, and..

03:08.820 --> 03:11.086
Hey! Strut my stuff.

03:13.553 --> 03:16.253
Now, I was gonna go to
New Orleans to that Mardi Gras

03:16.320 --> 03:17.486
but you know,
I don't look as good

03:17.553 --> 03:20.153
in a feathered mask
as I used to.

03:20.220 --> 03:22.920
Now that real sunshine
must be Synclaire.

03:22.986 --> 03:25.786
Oh...what an honor
it is to meet you.

03:25.853 --> 03:28.253
I feel like you've been
Overton's uncle all my life.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.253
Come here!

03:29.320 --> 03:30.353
[laughing]

03:30.420 --> 03:31.620
Okay, I get it.

03:31.686 --> 03:32.820
You, you happy to see me.

03:32.886 --> 03:33.920
[laughing]

03:33.986 --> 03:35.120
‐ Sit down, sit down.
‐ Ohh.

03:35.186 --> 03:37.953
Oh, girl, this man was like
a second father to me.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.086
Taught me everything.

03:39.153 --> 03:41.386
Right from wrong, up from down.

03:41.453 --> 03:43.520
Church girls from party girls.

03:43.586 --> 03:45.020
You know,
my friends have got to meet you.

03:45.086 --> 03:46.053
Mm..

03:46.120 --> 03:47.253
Go ahead and put your dogs up.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.286
‐ Yeah, I'm tired.
‐ Umm.

03:49.353 --> 03:50.953
Uncle Tibby's here!

03:52.220 --> 03:54.153
You know, the Uncle Tibby from

03:54.220 --> 03:56.420
all of Overton's
Uncle Tibby stories.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.020
Oh, and he's just so huggable.

03:59.086 --> 04:00.353
‐ Come on up, huh?
‐ Well..

04:00.420 --> 04:02.426
You just a 24‐hour
cup of coffee, ain't you?

04:02.493 --> 04:04.960
[all laughing]

04:06.493 --> 04:07.793
Ey, where's Aunt Bertha at?

04:07.860 --> 04:09.493
Ey, you know I can't get that

04:09.560 --> 04:10.826
Sunday school teachin'

04:10.893 --> 04:13.426
bourbon hidin',
pie bakin' woman out of Ohio.

04:13.493 --> 04:14.926
[knock on door]

04:18.125 --> 04:19.926
Where is he, where.. Ohh..

04:19.993 --> 04:22.793
Uncle Tibby,
this is Regine and Maxine.

04:22.860 --> 04:25.560
Lord, the room
is overflowing with beauty!

04:25.626 --> 04:26.560
[laughing]

04:26.626 --> 04:27.893
Now, Uncle Tibby

04:27.960 --> 04:31.026
it's not fair for you to focus
all your attention on me.

04:31.093 --> 04:32.493
[laughs]

04:32.560 --> 04:33.526
Especially, if you just ate.

04:33.593 --> 04:35.959
[laughing]

04:36.026 --> 04:39.293
Ladies, this is the godfather
of the whole Jones clan.

04:39.359 --> 04:41.793
Nobody made a move
without Uncle Tibby's blessing.

04:41.860 --> 04:43.226
Oh, he's exaggerating..

04:43.293 --> 04:45.593
Did I tell you I got Cousin
Bumpy to come back to church?

04:45.660 --> 04:48.193
Get out! Cousin Bumpy
was a straight‐up heathen!

04:49.460 --> 04:51.226
Woo! Hey, people.

04:55.926 --> 04:57.226
Uncle Tibby?

04:57.993 --> 04:59.126
Lumpy!

04:59.193 --> 05:00.266
[laughing]

05:00.333 --> 05:01.466
‐ "Lumpy?"
‐ "Lumpy?"

05:01.533 --> 05:02.533
"Lumpy?"

05:02.600 --> 05:04.333
I had a little baby fat
when I was young.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.066
A little,
when he walked down the street

05:06.133 --> 05:07.666
he sounded like a marching band.

05:07.733 --> 05:10.300
Flapitty, flapitty, flap‐flap.

05:10.366 --> 05:12.933
See, that is the kind of torment
that can scar a child for life.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.266
[chuckles]
No, it was them corduroy pants
that scarred him for life.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.833
[laughing]

05:17.900 --> 05:19.600
[indistinct]

05:20.866 --> 05:23.333
Oh, Uncle Tibby,
you're so funny.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.400
Every time
you say something like that

05:24.466 --> 05:26.100
it just make me
want to squeeze you.

05:26.166 --> 05:27.233
Say somethin' else.

And then every time
she looks at it

a great guy she lost.

I mean, coke bottle glasses

07:03.246 --> 07:06.246
acne‐ridden, braces,
sure, but fat, no.

07:06.313 --> 07:08.780
For the record, I was not fat.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.446
I was husky.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.380
Oh, Regine.

07:14.446 --> 07:16.613
Who threw up on the couch? Ugh.

this is painful for you.

08:59.053 --> 09:01.693
Man, wasn't
the subway great today?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.526
Who would have thought
that we would have seen a..

09:03.593 --> 09:06.360
A pickpocket,
a one‐armed juggler

09:06.426 --> 09:09.660
and a tap dancing transvestite
all in one car, huh?

09:12.293 --> 09:14.526
You could find
the bright side of roadkill.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.860
Food for vultures.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.693
Well, I'm gonna take a bath,
you know.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.426
If I don't get some
of this New York dirt off me

09:23.493 --> 09:25.426
somebody gonna write
"Wash me" on my butt.

09:26.493 --> 09:28.626
You know what,
I have some bath gel

09:28.693 --> 09:31.226
that will leave you
smellin' like firewood

09:31.293 --> 09:33.093
burning on a crisp winter night.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.893
Yeah, if, uh,
smelling like a chimney sweep

09:34.960 --> 09:36.426
don't relax me,
nothing else will.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.060
Alright, I'm gonna get..

09:38.126 --> 09:39.426
Yeah.

09:39.493 --> 09:41.060
You know, I'm really glad
you're here, man.

09:41.126 --> 09:43.693
Yeah, me too.
You done well for yourself.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.926
Nice home, nice job.

09:45.993 --> 09:48.426
And you keepin Lumpy off sweets.

09:48.493 --> 09:50.026
Well, you were the one
that talked me

09:50.093 --> 09:51.393
out of moving back to Cleveland

09:51.460 --> 09:53.860
when I got homesick
my second day here.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.626
I'll never forget your
wise and insightful words.

09:57.626 --> 09:58.660
"Stay."

10:00.060 --> 10:01.433
Hey, I never steered you wrong.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.366
Yeah, and if I hadn't
I never would've met

10:03.433 --> 10:05.666
my sweet lollipop, Synclaire.

10:05.733 --> 10:08.266
‐ 'Overton, about Synclaire.'
‐ 'Yes, sir.'

10:08.333 --> 10:10.700
You need to dump her.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.566
Dump Synclaire?

10:21.633 --> 10:24.633
Yeah, if I let you carry on
with that bippity‐boppity girl

10:24.700 --> 10:27.333
the whole Jones clan
will put a foot in me so deep

10:27.400 --> 10:29.000
I'd be tasting shoe polish.

10:30.466 --> 10:32.366
Bippity‐boppity..
What you talking about?

10:32.433 --> 10:35.133
Look, a‐a‐anybody
that happy, all the time

10:35.200 --> 10:39.100
is either high on corn whiskey
or she hiding something.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.100
Uh, Synclaire
is like a open book.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.633
As far as getting high
is concerned

10:42.700 --> 10:44.833
the girl get woozy
taking communion.

10:47.066 --> 10:48.666
She trying to get
her hooks in you.

10:48.733 --> 10:51.533
Here you are,
a handyman from Ohio

10:51.600 --> 10:53.833
you're maintaining
a brownstone in Brooklyn.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.833
She knows gold when it glitters.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.306
Yeah, but she sees more in me
than just the glamor.

11:00.373 --> 11:01.740
And what's
all this fool business

11:01.806 --> 11:03.173
about her wantin'
to be an actress?

11:03.240 --> 11:04.606
A‐alright, ho‐ho‐hold on now.

11:04.673 --> 11:05.773
You can't come in my house

11:05.840 --> 11:08.406
talking about my woman
like that, okay?

11:08.473 --> 11:10.573
Now, I know you wouldn't be
getting salty

11:10.640 --> 11:12.106
with your favorite uncle.

11:12.173 --> 11:14.173
Unless I struck a nerve.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.473
Which proves I'm right.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.306
See, you need to cool down.

11:17.373 --> 11:19.073
Let your good sense seep in.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.806
I'mma go get in the tub.

11:20.873 --> 11:23.306
Hey, hold on. We're not
finished with this yet.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.806
You're not letting it seep in.

11:26.873 --> 11:28.406
Do your uncle a favor.

11:28.473 --> 11:30.906
Get me some Lemon Joy
for my bath

11:30.973 --> 11:33.606
and, uh, some Vaseline
for the rusty spots, okay?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.140
Synclaire,
you're pouring orange juice

11:47.206 --> 11:48.140
into the mashed potatoes.

11:48.206 --> 11:49.340
Oh. Oh. Oh.

11:51.506 --> 11:54.140
Hmm, the citrus adds a zip
you just can't get with milk.

11:54.206 --> 11:55.640
I think you're
onto something there.

11:56.740 --> 11:59.040
Honey, what's wrong?

11:59.106 --> 12:02.813
I overheard Uncle Tibby
tell Overton to cut me loose.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.113
W‐why would he say that?

12:04.180 --> 12:07.513
I don't know. He even
called me "bippity‐boppity."

12:07.580 --> 12:09.313
That's amazing,
who knew there was a word

12:09.380 --> 12:10.780
that so perfectly describes you.

12:12.346 --> 12:14.446
I tried so hard
to impress that man.

12:14.513 --> 12:16.580
I even baked him cookies.

12:16.646 --> 12:18.580
Well, mistake number one.

12:21.146 --> 12:22.913
Do you understand,
that that man

12:22.980 --> 12:25.613
is the Grand Poobah
of Overton's family.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.646
If he doesn't like me, I will
never be Synclaire James‐Jones.

12:29.713 --> 12:31.813
Well, look, Synclaire,
being disliked is often a sign

12:31.880 --> 12:33.446
that you're strong,
that you have character

12:33.513 --> 12:35.346
and that people respect you.

12:35.413 --> 12:37.113
Or that you're a hag
people put up with

12:37.180 --> 12:38.680
because Khadijah
insists on dragging

12:38.746 --> 12:41.346
your behind around with her.

12:41.413 --> 12:44.046
Oh. Now, don't be
so hard on yourself.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.546
Synclaire, I say
you go talk to Overton.

12:48.613 --> 12:50.280
I mean, if there's one thing
I know there's nothing

12:50.346 --> 12:52.646
anyone can say that'll
shake his love for you.

12:54.013 --> 12:56.080
Unless you tell him about
when you used to eat dirt

12:56.146 --> 12:58.113
when you were seven..

13:00.853 --> 13:03.720
Hello, Lumpy.
Lumpy, Lumpy, Lumpy.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.620
Is there no safe haven
for me anywhere?

13:08.686 --> 13:12.553
Down here,
The hound from the hell.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.486
Upstairs, Uncle Fish Fry.

13:16.553 --> 13:18.120
Unless, of course,
he's down at the schoolyard

13:18.186 --> 13:21.086
making fun
of the husky children.

13:21.153 --> 13:22.753
Sorry, he's upstairs
taking a bath

13:22.820 --> 13:25.286
stewing in his own meanness.

13:25.353 --> 13:27.353
If you're lucky,
he's using your washcloth.

13:29.186 --> 13:31.720
Hmm, so I see you're
not wearing your bracelet.

13:31.786 --> 13:33.653
I guess it takes
some people a little longer

13:33.720 --> 13:35.353
to move on than others, huh?

13:35.420 --> 13:37.820
Yeah. I moved on, alright.

13:39.153 --> 13:40.820
I hocked your bracelet..

13:40.886 --> 13:43.220
...used the money to buy these.

13:43.286 --> 13:47.120
One hundred percent
full croc demi‐ankle boots.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.253
You hocked a $400 bracelet

13:51.320 --> 13:53.286
for a pair of fake crocodile
road stompers?

13:53.353 --> 13:54.553
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.120
Before you two come to blows,
give me some time

13:56.186 --> 13:58.120
to just pop some popcorn.

13:59.653 --> 14:01.293
You spent
that much money on me?

14:03.026 --> 14:04.926
I must have really
rocked your world.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.093
No! Wait! Kyle! Come on! Ey..

14:11.160 --> 14:13.393
The‐the‐the bag
hasn't even puffed yet.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.293
[knock on door]

14:22.393 --> 14:25.560
Hi, Obie.
Um, where's Uncle Tibby?

14:25.626 --> 14:27.693
Oh, knocked out
back in the bedroom.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.926
He said he that, uh, Lemon Joy
and fried baloney sandwiches

14:30.993 --> 14:32.960
is like one big sleeping pill.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.493
I heard what he said. I was
standing right outside the door.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.660
Damn. I'm sorry, baby.

14:39.726 --> 14:41.493
'Cause he had no right
to say those things.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.293
But I tell you what,
as soon as he wakes up

14:43.360 --> 14:44.860
I'm telling him
to pack up that Vaseline

14:44.926 --> 14:46.560
and just slide on outta here.

14:48.526 --> 14:51.060
Obie, you can't.

14:51.126 --> 14:52.560
Then I'd be known
as the trollop

14:52.626 --> 14:55.460
who drove a wedge between you
and your favorite uncle.

14:55.526 --> 14:57.360
And‐and‐and your resentment
would grow

14:57.426 --> 15:00.400
and one day you'll be taking
a blowtorch to my trolls

15:00.466 --> 15:02.333
and you won't even know why.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.400
Yeah, it's kind of hard
to argue with that logic.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.000
But I know that if he got
a chance to know you

15:10.066 --> 15:12.033
he'd love you just like I do.

15:12.766 --> 15:14.033
Hey, check this out.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.833
How about tomorrow, I'll
cook us up a real nice dinner?

15:16.900 --> 15:18.166
That could work.

15:18.233 --> 15:19.566
Yeah, you give me
a couple of hours

15:19.633 --> 15:22.366
and you two will be closer
than a tick on a porch dog.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.666
‐ I hope so.
‐ Yeah.

15:25.733 --> 15:27.133
'Cause, hey,
if it comes down to a choice

15:27.200 --> 15:28.733
between you and Uncle Tibby

15:28.800 --> 15:30.466
I'd just have to get used
to my favorite uncle

15:30.533 --> 15:32.300
not being in my life.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.300
It'd just be you and me.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.933
And Uncle Jelly.

15:39.366 --> 15:41.600
Aunt Fanny.

15:41.666 --> 15:43.700
Cousin Slats.

15:43.766 --> 15:46.700
Great Uncle Schmoke‐eye.

15:46.766 --> 15:48.866
And of course, Bob.

15:53.633 --> 15:54.833
[glass shatters]

15:56.166 --> 15:58.866
Golf? What, your life
not boring enough already?

16:00.140 --> 16:02.273
‐ Hey, Regine.
‐ 'Hey.'

16:02.340 --> 16:03.306
Bootzilla.

16:09.673 --> 16:11.673
I was wondering if I could
get that Robere's box

16:11.740 --> 16:14.240
I wanna put
this silver bracelet back in it.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.940
Well, actually,
Bootzilla crushed it.

16:17.006 --> 16:20.206
But I'm sure we have
something that will

16:20.273 --> 16:22.140
work just as well, let's see.

16:22.206 --> 16:24.306
We got.. Oh! Cartier.

16:24.373 --> 16:26.306
Van Cleef and Arpels.

16:27.506 --> 16:30.940
Miracle mart? Khadijah.

16:31.006 --> 16:33.973
Oh, poor little
turned‐out Kyle.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.040
You still aren't over me yet.
Oh..

16:36.106 --> 16:37.340
[Kyle chuckles]

16:37.406 --> 16:39.706
Well, actually the druggist
had a spray for that.

16:41.573 --> 16:43.740
And while I was down there
getting this out of hock

16:43.806 --> 16:46.406
I met a woman who was
pawning her engagement ring.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.506
We set up a date and if
all goes according to plan

16:48.573 --> 16:50.506
in a couple of weeks, I'll be
seeing her wearing this..

16:50.573 --> 16:51.673
[chuckles]

16:51.740 --> 16:53.340
...and nothing else.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.273
That's a pretty pathetic woman

16:56.340 --> 16:59.206
who'll accept a gift
with someone else's name on it.

16:59.273 --> 17:01.846
Well, actually the engraving
works to my benefit.

17:01.913 --> 17:04.113
You see, she is the owner
of the state of the art theatre

17:04.180 --> 17:05.680
down on 57th Street.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.713
Not the Imax theatre?

17:09.780 --> 17:12.913
‐ One and the same.
‐ Oh! Ha‐ha!

17:14.480 --> 17:16.913
One downwards stroke
of the engraver's pin.

17:18.113 --> 17:19.613
And I'm back in the saddle.
Psst.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.280
Giddyup, baby.

17:26.780 --> 17:27.913
[knock on door]

17:36.646 --> 17:39.780
Ooh. Girl, you look stunning.

17:39.846 --> 17:41.313
Well, I aim to please

17:41.380 --> 17:43.180
although I can't
seem to please everybody.

17:43.246 --> 17:44.780
Mm‐hmm.

17:44.846 --> 17:48.046
Is that neck bones
and rice I smell?

17:48.113 --> 17:50.080
Synclaire, you shouldn't have.

17:50.146 --> 17:52.680
Actually, I didn't,
Overton made it.

17:52.746 --> 17:56.313
Oh! Is this one of those
liberated relationships?

17:56.380 --> 17:57.946
Something wrong with that?

17:58.013 --> 17:59.553
O‐O‐Obie, Obie
aren't those neck bones

17:59.620 --> 18:01.020
jumping out of that pot?

18:01.086 --> 18:02.686
Oh, yeah, yeah. You're right.

18:02.753 --> 18:04.786
Uh, Synclaire, why don't you
tell him about how important

18:04.853 --> 18:06.453
your job is down at Flavor?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.120
You got a paying job?

18:10.553 --> 18:13.920
Actually, I'm an office manager
at a major magazine.

18:13.986 --> 18:15.720
Some would say
that I'm the nerve center

18:15.786 --> 18:18.020
of the entire operation.

18:18.086 --> 18:20.353
Oh, really?
How'd you get a job like that?

18:21.686 --> 18:22.953
[chuckles]

18:23.020 --> 18:25.520
Well, my cousin,
Khadijah, needed someone.

18:25.586 --> 18:26.986
I was the perfect choice.

18:27.053 --> 18:28.386
Mm‐hmm.

18:28.453 --> 18:30.420
Who needs a resume
when you got a cousin.

18:30.486 --> 18:33.553
Oh, no, she didn't need a family
to get her acting jobs, now.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.020
Listen, let me tell you.
The‐the..

18:35.086 --> 18:37.720
The infomercial
where I get fired.

18:37.786 --> 18:39.620
The play where I was naked.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.853
All me!

18:40.920 --> 18:42.120
Naked?

18:42.186 --> 18:45.086
Oh, next on. Now you wanna
say grace, Uncle Tib?

18:45.153 --> 18:47.520
Yeah, I, I'm gonna pray
she don't take her clothes off.

18:49.853 --> 18:51.486
Okay, that's it.

18:51.553 --> 18:52.920
Uncle Tibby, I, I mean

18:52.986 --> 18:56.153
this in the most respectful
way possible.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.153
Get up out my house.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.293
All this food and we goin' out?

19:07.826 --> 19:09.226
No, you goin' out.

19:09.293 --> 19:12.793
You can't come in here talkin'
about the woman that I love.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.493
Man, she's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.093
And if you can't get with that

19:17.160 --> 19:19.526
you ought to take them
neck bones to go.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.793
I can't go home.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.393
What d'you mean?

19:27.460 --> 19:29.393
I had a fight
with your Aunt Bertha.

19:33.026 --> 19:35.060
I went to see her
Sunday School youth choir

19:35.126 --> 19:37.660
and I told her they sounded like
a bunch of hyenas giving birth.

19:40.126 --> 19:42.326
Next thing I know,
I'm on a bus headed east.

19:43.460 --> 19:44.726
Damn woman.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.226
I miss her.

19:48.293 --> 19:50.593
Well, why don't you
just call her and apologize?

19:50.660 --> 19:53.193
Yes, and everything
will be all peachy again.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.860
Huh, peachy.

19:54.926 --> 19:56.960
Bertha says peachy.

19:57.026 --> 19:59.693
You got a lot
of Bertha in you, girl.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.666
‐ I'm gonna call Aunt Birdy‐‐
‐ Hold on, hold on, now.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.333
I don't know how
to apologize to that woman.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.400
Well, I'll tell you what,
you can start practicing

20:05.466 --> 20:07.400
on somebody in this room.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.833
I'm sorry I was a little harsh.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.466
Guess you remind me
so much of Bertha

20:18.533 --> 20:21.433
I took my blues out on you.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.500
Oh, you were going through
a tough time.

20:24.566 --> 20:28.166
♪ Woo woo woo
woo woo woo ♪

20:28.233 --> 20:29.733
Does Bertha do that too?

20:29.800 --> 20:30.766
Hell, no.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.466
Hey, Aunt Birdy‐bird, it's Obie.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.800
Hey.. Hey, you got it.

20:40.933 --> 20:42.200
Hey, Bertha.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.366

20:47.233 --> 20:48.833
Uh, I'm, I'm sorry, honey.

I'd like to come home.

Tone‐deaf angels.

Damn!

21:04.173 --> 21:06.073
Look, uh, I'm gonna need
a couple of nights here

21:06.140 --> 21:07.906
to work on this apology thing.

21:09.106 --> 21:11.106
Well, that's just fine.
Just fine.

21:11.173 --> 21:12.640
It'll give me
a chance to wow you

'Come on, Uncle Tibby, come on.'

21:27.140 --> 21:29.106
Maybe I can call her again.

about the children's choir.'

21:53.840 --> 21:56.406

Angels or hyenas.'
