<i>NARRATOR". We have already seen
a department store catalog...</i>

00:14.390 --> 00:17.060
<i>...air-mailed out the window...</i>

00:17.894 --> 00:22.106
<i>...a model of a catamaran sail earthward...</i>

00:22.732 --> 00:27.195
<i>...three little kittens lose their mittens.</i>

00:27.403 --> 00:32.366
<i>Gordon suspects the Catwoman.
How right he is.</i>

00:32.700 --> 00:37.330
<i>Batman and Robin
seek to stifle the Cat's meow.</i>

00:37.830 --> 00:43.211
<i>The Dynamic Duo
calls for help from a newsman.</i>

00:43.419 --> 00:46.047
<i>Catwoman is a schoolmarm.</i>

00:46.214 --> 00:48.591
<i>But the subjects are sinful.</i>

00:50.009 --> 00:52.220
<i>Batman and Robin spring a trap.</i>

00:52.428 --> 00:54.514
<i>It backfires.</i>

00:55.974 --> 00:59.102
<i>All their plans go out the window.</i>

01:00.061 --> 01:03.648
<i>They land in a fishnet. Be prepared.</i>

<i>Aunt Harriet swings with the latest dance,

03:05.019 --> 03:06.521
What time is it, Robin?

03:07.438 --> 03:10.066
What time is it?
Who cares what time it is?

03:10.441 --> 03:13.778
Judging from the position of the sun...

03:13.945 --> 03:17.073
...in just 16 seconds,
we're going to have a respite.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.075
How can you tell?

03:19.742 --> 03:23.830
Don't you remember?
There's an eclipse of the sun due.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.582
But that's only for a half-minute.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.962
That's all we'll need, Robin,
if my calculus is correct.

03:37.510 --> 03:39.053
There it is.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.222
We've only got one chance, Robin.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.974
Do exactly as I say.

03:43.850 --> 03:44.976
Right, Batman.

03:45.727 --> 03:50.565
Move the magnifying glass
precisely 14 degrees to your left.

03:50.732 --> 03:54.026
I've calculated the azimuthal
equidistant projection of the sun's rays.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.278
But be careful, Robin.

03:56.028 --> 04:02.410
One degree too little, or too much,
and your hand will be reduced to an ash.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.663
Ah!

05:02.512 --> 05:05.306
That was the closest call
we've ever had, Batman.

05:05.515 --> 05:08.226
I have to admit, I was scared.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.645
I had no fear whatsoever, Robin.

05:10.853 --> 05:13.940
- You didn't?
-Not a bit.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.526
Haven't you noticed
how we always manage to escape...

05:16.692 --> 05:19.529
...the vicious ensnarements
of our underhanded opponents?

05:19.737 --> 05:23.866
- Don't you know why?
-Because we're smarter than they are.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.538
I prefer to believe
it's because our hearts are pure.

05:33.626 --> 05:38.130
But just what was it she told us
before she left us to die?

05:38.339 --> 05:40.633
Something about an assault
on Mount Gotham.

05:40.842 --> 05:46.597
- Just where is Mount Gotham?
-Why, it's... it's... I don't know.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.058
Holy Alps!
I'd better brush up on my geography.

05:49.267 --> 05:52.812
- It won't do a bit of good in this case, Robin.
-It wouldn't?

05:52.979 --> 05:56.607
Because there is no Mount Gotham.
There's a Mount Sack, a Mount Blank...

05:56.816 --> 05:59.318
...a Mount Gomery,
but there is no Mount Gotham.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.571
Then what did she mean?

06:02.655 --> 06:07.326
There are man-made mountains
in Gotham City's concrete jungle.

06:07.535 --> 06:11.581
- What's the highest peak?
-The Gotham State Building.

06:11.789 --> 06:17.712
Rising a magnificent 102 stories
above the city's din.

06:17.879 --> 06:20.047
What could she be doing
at the Gotham State Building?

06:20.214 --> 06:23.342
We'll never find out standing here, Robin.
To the Batmobile.

06:52.330 --> 06:54.832
Uh-Oh. Better put 5 cents in the meter.

06:55.041 --> 06:57.835
No policeman's going to give
the Batmobile a ticket.

06:58.044 --> 07:01.464
No matter, Robin. This money
goes toward building better roads.

07:01.672 --> 07:05.259
We all must do our part.
Good citizenship, you know?

07:05.468 --> 07:08.721
Holy taxation.
You're right again, Batman.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.522
Batman. And Robin, the Boy Wonder.

07:18.731 --> 07:20.524
Well, what an auspicious occasion.

07:20.733 --> 07:23.319
Please, come into my office.
I'll have some soft drinks sent in.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.821
There's no time for that,
we're here on official business.

07:26.030 --> 07:29.241
Are there any special
or unusual events here today?

07:30.034 --> 07:33.537
Hmm. Nothing that I can think of off-hand.

07:33.746 --> 07:36.707
Oh, wait a minute.
Yes, there is something. Here, I'll check.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.001
This may be it.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.673
Yes, yes, we've rented the penthouse
for a party late this afternoon.

07:44.298 --> 07:49.470
- With whom did you make this transaction?
-With Mr. Zubin Zucchini.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.973
Zubin Zucchini?

07:52.139 --> 07:55.601
He's the eccentric millionaire
who cornered the sulfur market in the 1920s.

07:55.768 --> 07:59.271
And established
the world-famous Ruby Match Company.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.067
- Yeah, one and the same.
-Come on, Robin, there's no time to lose.

08:14.704 --> 08:17.039
Hey, there's the great Zubin Zucchini now.

08:17.248 --> 08:19.917
Dressed like that
and getting into an armored truck?

08:20.126 --> 08:23.546
- Must be some kind of a nut or something.
-You should be a kind of nut.

08:23.713 --> 08:27.550
He's got 18 million bucks.
Give or take a grand or two.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.011
<i>Speak.</i>

08:30.219 --> 08:34.140
We're outside Zucchini's house.
He just flew the coop.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.727
<i>Splendid, proceed with plan A.</i>

08:52.366 --> 08:55.286
Well, I'm all ready, young man--

08:55.703 --> 08:57.371
Yes, young lady, what is it?

08:57.580 --> 09:01.459
Are you Ms. Minerva Mathews,
the well-known wealthy recluse?

09:01.959 --> 09:05.212
For lack of a better cognomen,
yes, I am.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.666
Yes.

09:45.086 --> 09:47.838
Can I help you, young man?

09:48.047 --> 09:52.093
I'm the armored car driver, come to take you
to the Gotham State Building, ma'am.

09:52.301 --> 09:56.847
Oh, good. Do you have the money?

09:57.056 --> 10:00.017
Five hundred thousand dollars,
from your Christmas Club account.

10:00.226 --> 10:01.727
Oh, good.

10:01.936 --> 10:05.356
That Mr. Zucchini just--
Just insists upon cash.

10:05.940 --> 10:10.402
He doesn't trust checks
since the banks bounced back in 1929.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.041
Well...

10:27.711 --> 10:32.258
...you drive very well, Mr...?
-Staphylococcus.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.803
- What?
-Ralph Staphylococcus.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.471
My friend calls me Ralph.

10:38.347 --> 10:42.017
Ralphie, have you had this job long?

10:42.685 --> 10:45.729
Four years next July 22nd, ma'am.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.566
I'm studying to be an accountant at night.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.818
Can't raise three kids on this salary.

10:50.985 --> 10:55.739
Oh, you're married. How nice for you.

10:55.948 --> 11:00.161
<i>Canary to cat. Canary to cat.
Bat has flown the belfry.</i>

11:00.369 --> 11:04.498
<i>- Escaped the aluminum reflector.
- Curses, foiled</i> again. <i>Tsk.</i>

11:09.295 --> 11:13.841
Oh, that's my 11-year-old nephew, Marshall.
I gave him this little intercom.

11:14.049 --> 11:17.928
We-- He likes to play cops and robbers.

11:18.137 --> 11:20.347
He's got a mighty deep voice
for an 11-year-old.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.559
He matured early.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.271
Proceed with plan B, notify all others.

11:45.581 --> 11:49.418
- Mr. Zucchini, may I help you carry those, sir?
-No, open the door, then get lost.

11:49.627 --> 11:55.049
- Yes, sir. I'll just see you to the elevator, sir.
-I can find an elevator by myself.

12:12.775 --> 12:17.655
You just sign here, Ms. Mathews.
Receipt for the money.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.080
Just a minute, my good man.

12:26.288 --> 12:30.542
Here's a little gratuity
to help you along the way.

13:19.008 --> 13:21.635
All right, boys, out on the ledge.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.722
But it's 102 stories straight down.

13:24.930 --> 13:29.643
Well, you've got eight more lives. Out.

13:47.328 --> 13:49.121
Did Catwoman just enter this building?

13:49.288 --> 13:53.584
- Catwoman? No, no, just a sweet little old lady.
-We'll see how sweet.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.343
Catwoman's up there. She's about to make off
with the bundle, if we let her.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.553
But we still don't know
what she's stealing.

14:04.762 --> 14:05.888
Eight pieces of catgut.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.890
- How much could they be worth?
-Plenty.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.602
They're attached to two Stradivarius violins.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.938
Each one is being sold today
for a quarter of a million dollars.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.941
A half a million in total.
Who's buying them?

14:19.234 --> 14:20.903
Ms. Minerva Mathews.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.155
The well-known and wealthy recluse?

14:23.906 --> 14:27.785
For cash. That's your sweet
little old lady, Mr. Cramer.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.497
So there's a cool million in goods
and money for her to purloin, huh?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.040
But why here?

14:33.248 --> 14:35.876
The 102nd floor
of the Gotham State Building...

14:36.085 --> 14:39.588
...is the only place in Gotham City
with the proper altitude and humidity...

14:39.797 --> 14:42.424
...to inspect those violins. They haven't been
out of their cases in 30 years...

14:42.633 --> 14:44.802
...and might crack
in the improper atmosphere.

14:45.010 --> 14:49.306
- Look, up there! Are they birds?
-Are they planes?

14:49.515 --> 14:53.644
No, they're cat burglars.
Quickly, to the elevators.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.276
Excuse me, citizens.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.925
She's put the elevators
out of commission.

15:25.134 --> 15:26.552
How will she escape?

15:26.760 --> 15:30.806
She must have something in her devious mind.
The question is, how will we catch her?

15:31.014 --> 15:34.059
I'll take me men
and we'll run up the 102 flights of stairs.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.520
I don't have time for that.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.690
The Batjet. Come on.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.658
- What are those, Batman?
-Batjets, commissioner.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.202
I haven't tried them yet,
but they shoot out enough power...

15:52.411 --> 15:55.247
...to get one of those elevators
up to the penthouse.

16:09.636 --> 16:13.849
All right, everybody, back up, back up, back up.
Cover your ears.

16:21.231 --> 16:26.862
Five, four, three, two, one, lift-off.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.339
Seems to be in excellent tune.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.175
Ought to be, paying enough for it.

16:48.634 --> 16:51.803
There's only $499,000 here.

16:52.012 --> 16:57.184
Yeah. I tipped the young driver
a thousand dollars for being so sweet.

16:57.392 --> 16:58.810
Didn't think you'd mind.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.812
Tip him with your own money.

17:02.231 --> 17:05.025
It is my money, you old goat.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.237
It's my money now. A deal is a deal.

17:09.905 --> 17:13.200
You are categorically wrong.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.538
- What are you doing?
-I'm getting out of these mousey clothes...

17:17.996 --> 17:20.707
...and into the guise of...

17:20.874 --> 17:22.166
...Catwoman.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.794
Catwoman?

17:23.961 --> 17:28.006
- Now, hand over the cash, Zucchini.
-The heck, you say.

17:28.549 --> 17:31.176
The heck I says it.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.350
Maybe you can bully an aging mogul,
but not me, Catwoman.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.729
Robin, my little Chickadee,
how nice to see you again.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.817
You better come quietly, Catwoman.
It looks like you've been thwarted.

17:47.359 --> 17:49.444
Look again, my effervescent elf.

17:50.696 --> 17:52.614
- Ow!
- Let's can the gab-athon...

17:52.781 --> 17:54.157
...and throw this rascal out.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.034
I might have known you were involved.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.912
A person like you can give a bad name
to gossip columnists.

17:59.288 --> 18:02.124
You'll never get out of here,
it's 102 stories straight down.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.167
And the police will be waiting for you.

18:04.376 --> 18:08.213
- Uhn!
-We're not going straight down.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.384
We're going straight up, sweetheart.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.935
This is our ticket to freedom.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.480
You're all right, Jack.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.566
Shall we throw the kid over the side?

18:28.191 --> 18:32.154
Yeah, it's time to pin the climax
of this stanza.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.621
<i>NARRATOR".
Batman, where are you?</i>

18:40.787 --> 18:43.707
<i>Is this the one time you'll be too late?</i>

18:45.125 --> 18:49.212
Unhand that boy, and be quick about it,
or I'll know the reason why.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.262
I thought it was curtains this time.

18:57.471 --> 19:00.807
Save your strength, Robin.
You'll need it all to help subdue these cats.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.727
I think all we have to do now is blast off.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.857
You can't get away from Batman that easy.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.692
- Easily.
-Easily.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.445
- Good grammar is essential, Robin.
-Thank you, Batman.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.864
You're welcome. Now, let's get them.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.702
Blast off.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.168
Giddyap.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.730
Get out.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.566
Giddyap.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.530
Careful, Robin, it's quite a drop.

19:56.697 --> 19:59.616
You contemptible cat burglar.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.785
You thieving thugs.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.459
Drat, drat, double drat.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.301
Giddyap.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.848
Get out. Get out of there. Get out.

20:46.163 --> 20:47.456
Catwoman's escaped.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.916
I don't think so,
she knows the place is covered.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.169
She must be out on that ledge.

21:03.889 --> 21:07.476
Be careful, Catwoman.
There's no way out. Come back.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.228
I'd rather die.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.024
Don't be ridiculous.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.284
You've convinced me.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.537
Take hold of this Batrope.
Secure it about your waist.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.337
What do I do with the Stradivari-i?

21:35.796 --> 21:39.174
Drop them, they were phonies anyhow.
Better let go of the money too.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.927
Someone at the bottom will pick it up.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.073
Hold on, Catwoman, I'll pull you up.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.206
Oops.

22:14.459 --> 22:18.421
- Batman?
-I'm okay, Robin. Just get us out of here.

22:19.965 --> 22:23.844
- Batman, you saved my life.
-It was the least I could do.

22:27.556 --> 22:30.392
How can I ever combat you again
after all you've done for me?

22:30.559 --> 22:32.811
Let's hope it never comes to that,
Catwoman.

22:33.436 --> 22:38.275
Because in the end,
veracity and rectitude always triumph.

22:38.942 --> 22:43.154
- Batman, are you spoken for?
- Mm-hm.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.991
Married, engaged, or going steady?

22:46.199 --> 22:50.704
My crime fighting leaves me little time
for social engagements.

22:50.912 --> 22:56.084
Boy, have I got a girl for you.

23:06.595 --> 23:09.806
Well, Catwoman, I guess that's goodbye
for 10 to 20 years.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.476
You've been really swell, Batman.

23:13.685 --> 23:16.730
What with testifying against me
at the trial and all.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.232
You'll never know
how much I appreciated that.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.735
I have to do my job, Catwoman.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.448
- I guess you do.
-Don't fret.

23:26.615 --> 23:29.451
With good behavior you could be out
in seven and a half years.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.830
I'll be an old tabby by then.

23:34.372 --> 23:39.252
Never fear, there will always be someone
waiting for one as beauteous as you.

23:40.295 --> 23:43.673
That's the nicest thing
you could have said.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.093
May I?

24:04.152 --> 24:09.658
- I wonder if we've seen the end of her.
-I wouldn't hazard a guess, Robin.

24:10.867 --> 24:14.329
Why, Batman, are you blushing?

24:14.537 --> 24:17.248
It's the...
The heat of the day, commissioner.

24:17.415 --> 24:22.921
- Oh.
-Unseasonably warm, don't you think?

24:23.305 --> 24:29.935
