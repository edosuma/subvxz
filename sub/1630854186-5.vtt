WEBVTT

00:00.664 --> 00:02.166
Previously on Young Sheldon...
Arrested?

00:02.166 --> 00:04.980
Well, they're probably
gonna have to pay some fine,

00:04.980 --> 00:07.007
and-and they're gonna need cash.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.384
What the hell?

00:08.384 --> 00:10.177
What are you doing here?

00:10.177 --> 00:11.554
I'm saving you.

00:11.554 --> 00:13.097
Well, damn.

00:13.097 --> 00:14.723
Look, you're just a kid, okay?

00:14.723 --> 00:16.517
You don't understand
what's going on here.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.853
I know my mom lost her job
and got kicked out of the church

00:18.853 --> 00:20.771
because you won't
marry my brother.

00:20.771 --> 00:21.856
Where you going?

00:21.856 --> 00:23.190
To dance.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.650
I didn't think
you Baptists did that.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.861
We don't drink, neither. Ooh.

00:26.861 --> 00:29.113
The kids asleep?
Yup.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.740
You want to... fool around?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.659
Are you messing with me?

00:33.659 --> 00:35.286
I'm hoping to.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.371
Well, hot diggity dog.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.251
Hey.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.878
Oh, thanks for coming.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.880
Sounded important.
What's going on?

00:45.880 --> 00:48.716
Walk with me. Okay.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.718
You know that money I owe you?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.720
Oh, you got it?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.763
Yes and no.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.599
Uh, well, which is it?

00:56.599 --> 00:58.309
Yes, I got it,

00:58.309 --> 01:00.227
no, I'm not giving it to you.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.605
I want to give you

01:02.605 --> 01:05.107
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.610
Well, I'd prefer my money.

01:07.610 --> 01:10.696
Do you see
any unoccupied machines here?

01:10.696 --> 01:13.115
No.
Exactly.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.327
We are at capacity.
It's time to expand.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.078
Where?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.040
The video store
right behind that wall

01:21.040 --> 01:23.500
just lost its lease.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.003
Aw, heck. I was gonna
pick up the new John Candy.

01:26.003 --> 01:29.381
Well, as my partner
in this enterprise,

01:29.381 --> 01:32.384
you can get that new
John Candy for free.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.762
So you're gonna
buy a video store?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.931
Video store in the front,

01:36.931 --> 01:40.434
video poker in the back.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.102
Where are you getting
the poker machine?

01:42.102 --> 01:45.314
Biloxi, Mississippi.
Oh. You didn't
learn a lesson

01:45.314 --> 01:47.483
when you got arrested
at the border?
Yes.

01:47.483 --> 01:49.193
I learned not
to smuggle contraband

01:49.193 --> 01:51.111
with my idiot grandson.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.990
But there's nothing illegal
about buying poker machines.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.200
Till you plug 'em in.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.202
Well, sure.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.871
Come on. What do you say?

02:00.871 --> 02:04.833
You and me, a panel truck,
Biloxi or bust?

02:04.833 --> 02:08.504
So I'm gonna be your partner
in an illegal gambling room?

02:08.504 --> 02:10.547
Hidden by a legal
video store.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.884
Connie. Gee...
Come on. You said
you want to drive around

02:13.884 --> 02:15.678
in an RV, see the country.

02:15.678 --> 02:17.846
This is that, but exciting.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.223
We could go to jail.

02:19.223 --> 02:22.142
That's the exciting part.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.062

02:25.062 --> 02:27.690

02:41.253 --> 02:41.829
Hello, Mom.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.913
It's your son, Sheldon.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.597
Hello, my son, Sheldon.

02:44.597 --> 02:45.374
I have an 8:00 a.m.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.167
class tomorrow,
and I was wondering

02:47.167 --> 02:48.794
if I could spend the night
in my dorm.
That's fine.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.504
Now before you answer,
hear me out.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.506
I have a list of reasons
why this is a good idea.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.649
Number one... Sheldon,

02:53.649 --> 02:55.573
I know that you're safe there.
It's fine.

02:55.573 --> 02:57.632
That's reason number four.
Please don't skip ahead.

02:57.632 --> 02:58.576
Honey,

02:58.576 --> 03:01.788
I trust you. Just go to bed
at a reasonable hour

03:01.788 --> 03:03.289
and call if you need anything.

03:03.289 --> 03:04.707
Otherwise,
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:04.707 --> 03:06.209
Okay. Number one: I'm not...

03:06.209 --> 03:08.002
Goodbye, Sheldon.

03:09.545 --> 03:11.172
Who hangs up on a list?

03:11.172 --> 03:12.757
What's his problem now?

03:12.757 --> 03:15.176
Nothing. He wants to spend
the night at the dorm

03:15.176 --> 03:17.220
so he can get
to an early class.

03:17.220 --> 03:19.597
Really? And you said okay?

03:19.597 --> 03:21.307
He is old enough

03:21.307 --> 03:24.727
to have an
overnighter, and...

03:24.727 --> 03:27.522
it might be nice for us
to have a little alone time.

03:27.522 --> 03:29.357
Ooh. What about Missy?

03:29.357 --> 03:30.817
She's having dinner
with a friend.

03:30.817 --> 03:33.444
So, the house to ourselves.

03:33.444 --> 03:34.654
I like it.

03:34.654 --> 03:36.948
Hold on.

03:36.948 --> 03:38.741
Hello?
Number two--

03:38.741 --> 03:40.493
I have my own bathroom. Number...

03:40.493 --> 03:43.037
Boy, that's a lot
of plates.

03:43.037 --> 03:45.206
What do you want, Georgie?
I just talked to Meemaw.

03:45.206 --> 03:47.083
She says she's gonna be out
of town for a couple days.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.417
Yup, she told me.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.837
Patty melt.
Good choice.

03:50.837 --> 03:52.505
Okay. Enjoy.

03:52.505 --> 03:54.841
I'm just worried about you
being all by yourself

03:54.841 --> 03:56.175
in that big house.
I'll be fine.

03:56.175 --> 03:58.052
What if there's a tornado?

03:58.052 --> 03:59.887
Did Meemaw ever show you
where her hidey hole is?

03:59.887 --> 04:02.348
Georgie, I'm really busy
right now. Sorry.

04:02.348 --> 04:04.851
I'll swing by Meemaw's later,
maybe bring some takeout.

04:04.851 --> 04:07.019
Don't bother. They send me home
with plenty of food.

04:07.019 --> 04:09.021
Great. Score me
a patty melt, would you?

04:09.021 --> 04:11.399
I won't.
I'm gonna go now.

04:11.399 --> 04:14.694
What are you doing?
Kissing our baby.

04:14.694 --> 04:16.279
You want one, too?

04:16.279 --> 04:17.280
No.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.032
Bye-bye.

04:20.032 --> 04:22.076
I'm home.

04:24.579 --> 04:26.706
Anybody here?

04:26.706 --> 04:29.083
Missy?
Yeah.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.918
You're home early.

04:30.918 --> 04:32.753
It's 7:00.

04:32.753 --> 04:34.714
Is it?

04:34.714 --> 04:36.716
Are you sleeping?

04:36.716 --> 04:38.092
Yeah.

04:38.092 --> 04:39.594
Where's Dad?

04:41.368 --> 04:42.263
I'm here.

04:42.263 --> 04:43.431
Ugh.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.652
We were both just real tired.

04:46.739 --> 04:49.200
Please stop talking.

04:57.374 --> 04:59.585
What on earth is going on?

05:01.420 --> 05:03.923
Aah!
No skateboarding in the hallway.

05:03.923 --> 05:05.591
Aah!

05:06.550 --> 05:09.303
This childishness cannot
be allowed to continue.

05:10.221 --> 05:12.097
Hello. I need to tattle.

05:13.933 --> 05:15.851
What?

05:15.851 --> 05:17.811
Is your room on fire?

05:17.811 --> 05:19.688
No.

05:19.688 --> 05:20.940
But I see smoke.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.733
Okay.

05:22.733 --> 05:24.777
You need to know
there's people skateboarding

05:24.777 --> 05:26.403
and playing loud music
in the hallways.

05:26.403 --> 05:29.031
What do you want me
to do about it?

05:29.031 --> 05:30.407
You're the resident advisor.

05:30.407 --> 05:31.742
It's your job
to enforce the rules.

05:31.742 --> 05:34.119
I'll get right on it.

05:34.119 --> 05:35.788
Thank you.

05:35.788 --> 05:40.459
The system works.

05:45.089 --> 05:46.674
Ugh.

05:46.674 --> 05:50.052
Oh, I'm gonna be
so cranky tomorrow.

05:54.598 --> 05:56.809
So, how'd you hear
about these poker machines?

05:56.809 --> 05:58.102
I know a guy.

05:58.102 --> 05:59.603
What kind of guy?

05:59.603 --> 06:01.981
A guy who knows a guy.

06:01.981 --> 06:04.275
Well, what do you know
about that guy?

06:04.275 --> 06:06.318
He owned a riverboat casino.

06:06.318 --> 06:07.861
He owned?

06:07.861 --> 06:09.321
He might be dead.

06:09.321 --> 06:10.656
Dead?

06:10.656 --> 06:11.991
He might not be.

06:11.991 --> 06:13.534
They never found the body.

06:13.534 --> 06:15.119
Oh, my God.

06:15.119 --> 06:16.829
Exciting, huh?
No.

06:16.829 --> 06:19.248
It's upsetting.
Oh, now, come on.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.709
You've been in the sporting
goods business long enough.

06:21.709 --> 06:23.752
Haven't you ever sold
a bunch of shoulder pads

06:23.752 --> 06:25.129
that fell off
the back of a truck?

06:25.129 --> 06:26.714
Absolutely not.

06:26.714 --> 06:29.300
I buy 'em from a reputable
company named Tuffy.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.010
Boring.

06:40.102 --> 06:42.104
I smell your shampoo.

06:42.104 --> 06:43.522
Aw, damn it.

06:43.522 --> 06:45.899
How long have you been
sitting out there?

06:45.899 --> 06:47.901
All night.
And why?

06:49.737 --> 06:51.655
Are you familiar with Arkham
Asylum from the Batman comics?

06:51.655 --> 06:53.073
No.
Well, it's a madhouse,

06:53.073 --> 06:55.117
as is my dormitory
after the sun goes down.

06:55.117 --> 06:57.161
Sheldon, I am the president
of this university.

06:57.161 --> 06:58.954
I don't handle noise complaints.

06:58.954 --> 07:01.040
That's why
there's a resident advisor.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.500
Oh, I went to him.
And?

07:03.500 --> 07:04.835
You saw me sleeping
on the bench like a hobo.

07:04.835 --> 07:06.337
What do you think?
Can't you just--

07:06.337 --> 07:08.297
I don't know-- chalk this up as

07:08.297 --> 07:09.923
part of the college experience?

07:09.923 --> 07:11.925
Yeah, the clown college experience.

07:11.925 --> 07:13.594
I'm sorry. I'm cranky.

07:13.594 --> 07:15.596
I've compiled a
list of reasons

07:15.596 --> 07:17.835
why I should be appointed
the dormitory R.A.

07:18.327 --> 07:20.121
Number one...
Fine. You're the R.A.

07:21.686 --> 07:23.147
Okay. "Number one:
I love rules--

07:23.265 --> 07:24.808
"creating them,
following them,

07:24.808 --> 07:26.434
and most fun of all,
enforcing them."

07:26.434 --> 07:27.769
You're the R.A., Sheldon.

07:27.769 --> 07:29.604
Excellent.
"Number two-- punishment

07:29.604 --> 07:31.898
for rule infractions must be
both fair and merciless."

07:38.488 --> 07:41.449
Hmm.
Ooh. Eggs and pancakes.

07:41.449 --> 07:45.245
That's what a lumberjack gets
for chopping all that wood.

07:45.245 --> 07:46.913
I'll be Paul Bunyan,

07:46.913 --> 07:49.749
you can be my babe,
the blue fox.

07:49.749 --> 07:52.002
George.

07:52.002 --> 07:54.129
Ugh. Still?

07:54.129 --> 07:55.380
Morning, honey.

07:55.380 --> 07:56.923
What is happening
with you two?

07:56.923 --> 07:58.300
What do you mean?

07:58.300 --> 07:59.634
Is one of you dying?

07:59.634 --> 08:01.469
No one's dying.

08:01.469 --> 08:03.430
Sometimes, married people kiss.

08:03.430 --> 08:05.640
On TV maybe, not here.

08:05.640 --> 08:09.477
Well, young lady, how do you
think you came into this world?

08:09.477 --> 08:12.564
Okay, you're freaking me out.

08:14.941 --> 08:19.487
Here you go,
as advertised.

08:21.948 --> 08:25.160
All right.
Those look good.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.746
Wait. Hold on.
How do we know they work?

08:27.746 --> 08:30.624
What kind of operation
you think I'm running here?

08:30.624 --> 08:33.835
Well, I don't know. The word
"sketchy" comes to mind.

08:33.835 --> 08:35.211
Be cool.

08:35.211 --> 08:38.006
Uh, you mind
if we plug a couple in?

08:38.006 --> 08:39.799
Mind if you show me the money?

08:39.799 --> 08:42.177
Sure. Turn around.

08:42.177 --> 08:43.136
Why?

08:43.136 --> 08:45.347
You want the money or not?

08:46.431 --> 08:48.058
Okay, go ahead.

08:48.058 --> 08:50.101
Yeah.

09:00.236 --> 09:01.488
Okay.

09:01.488 --> 09:03.657
20 grand.

09:03.657 --> 09:05.533
Light 'em up.

09:15.001 --> 09:18.171
That's the sexiest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

09:18.171 --> 09:20.173
Really?

09:20.173 --> 09:22.342
Well, I just took my pants off.

09:22.342 --> 09:24.511
Attention, residents
of Bower Hall.

09:24.511 --> 09:27.263
My name is Sheldon Cooper,
and I'm your new R.A.

09:27.263 --> 09:29.391
The age of chaos is over.

09:29.391 --> 09:30.725
I repeat, the age
of chaos is over.

09:30.725 --> 09:32.268
Please take a moment

09:32.268 --> 09:33.895
to familiarize yourself
with the dormitory rules

09:33.895 --> 09:35.855
posted on the bulletin board.

09:35.855 --> 09:39.401
Ignorance of these rules is no
excuse, and violators will be...

09:44.114 --> 09:47.075
New rule. Unauthorized use
of my bullhorn is forbidden.

09:47.075 --> 09:50.328
I repeat. Unauthorized...
Shut up.

09:52.163 --> 09:53.790
Anybody home?

09:53.790 --> 09:56.501
Oh, good. You're here.

09:56.501 --> 09:58.002
Hey.

09:58.002 --> 10:00.213
Check it out. I got this video
about childbirth.

10:00.213 --> 10:01.715
I thought
we could watch it tonight.

10:01.715 --> 10:03.216
That sounds awful.

10:03.216 --> 10:05.635
Well, it does say
"contains graphic images"

10:05.635 --> 10:07.303
right there on the box.

10:07.303 --> 10:09.264
Maybe some other time, Georgie.

10:09.264 --> 10:11.766
No worries. I also picked up
Look Who's Talking,

10:11.766 --> 10:14.310
which is just about a baby
who says stuff.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.229
If you're trying to make this,
like, a date night

10:16.229 --> 10:17.897
or something,
it's not happening.

10:17.897 --> 10:19.858
Oh, who said anything
about a date?

10:19.858 --> 10:22.485
It's just us having dinner
and watching a movie.

10:22.485 --> 10:24.738
Last time we did that
I wound up pregnant.

10:24.738 --> 10:27.073
Mm, that was a good date.

10:27.073 --> 10:29.325
Well, that's not
happening tonight.

10:29.325 --> 10:30.952
I get it. Nothing romantic.

10:30.952 --> 10:33.163
Just two future parents watching
the miracle of childbirth

10:33.163 --> 10:36.624
or a movie that got two
thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert.

10:36.624 --> 10:38.460
And not only that.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.128
Then someone
defaced my rule sheet

10:40.128 --> 10:41.755
with a drawing of testicles.

10:43.131 --> 10:45.175
Well, that is so immature.

10:45.175 --> 10:47.761
I agree. Simply naming me
dorm R.A. isn't enough

10:47.761 --> 10:49.262
to command respect.

10:49.262 --> 10:51.097
I need a physical symbol
of my authority,

10:51.097 --> 10:52.599
like the way a king
had a scepter.

10:52.599 --> 10:54.434
So, you want a scepter?

10:54.434 --> 10:56.436
No, that could be used
against me.

10:56.436 --> 10:57.979
Ooh, how about a badge?

10:57.979 --> 10:59.397
I'd be like a Texas Ranger

10:59.397 --> 11:01.107
who patrols the halls
of a dormitory.

11:01.107 --> 11:03.777
Well, these all just
such terrific ideas but,

11:03.777 --> 11:06.738
um, how about an official letter
from my desk

11:06.738 --> 11:10.200
with a handwritten note
attesting to your position?

11:10.200 --> 11:14.537
All right.
"To the students of Bower Hall."

11:14.537 --> 11:16.206
That's your handwriting?

11:17.123 --> 11:18.792
"This document

11:18.792 --> 11:23.505
"bestows on Sheldon Cooper
all the powers

11:23.505 --> 11:25.590
and privileges
of resident advisor."

11:25.590 --> 11:27.217
"Bestows." I like it.

11:30.136 --> 11:32.347
Sloppy, but I like it.

11:32.347 --> 11:34.349
♪ I can see a new horizon ♪

11:34.349 --> 11:35.975
♪ Realize ♪

11:35.975 --> 11:37.685
♪ That will keep me realizin' ♪

11:37.685 --> 11:40.814

11:40.814 --> 11:42.232
Nope.

11:42.232 --> 11:43.650
♪ Need your lovin'

11:44.609 --> 11:46.694
Well, I got to tell you,

11:46.694 --> 11:49.322
that was pretty exciting.
Mm. I told you.

11:49.322 --> 11:51.407
For a while there,
I felt like Bonnie and Clyde,

11:51.407 --> 11:53.409
without all the murder
and mayhem.

11:53.409 --> 11:55.703
Well, the night's still young.

11:57.622 --> 12:01.167
So at the risk of sounding
more like Bonnie than Clyde, uh,

12:01.167 --> 12:03.545
where do we stand
in our relationship?

12:03.545 --> 12:06.172
You're the one
who broke up with me.

12:06.172 --> 12:09.551
Oh, maybe
I've rethought the situation.

12:09.551 --> 12:11.219
So you were wrong.

12:11.219 --> 12:15.181
I don't believe
there's any right or wrong here.

12:15.181 --> 12:18.226
Say it. Say you were wrong.

12:18.226 --> 12:20.854
I do regret it.

12:20.854 --> 12:23.648
Because... you were...

12:23.648 --> 12:25.275
wrong.

12:26.276 --> 12:27.610
Yes.

12:28.987 --> 12:31.322
So what do you say-- you want
to give it another chance?

12:31.322 --> 12:32.407
Hang on.

12:32.407 --> 12:33.950
Just give me a straight answer.

12:33.950 --> 12:35.910
I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

12:35.910 --> 12:37.579
I think we're being followed.

12:37.579 --> 12:39.080
What?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.707
No.

12:40.707 --> 12:42.458
The pickup truck?

12:42.458 --> 12:43.751
The orange Pinto.

12:43.751 --> 12:45.628
I saw it when
we gassed up.

12:45.628 --> 12:47.213
It's been two cars back
ever since.

12:47.213 --> 12:49.716
I'm gonna speed up
and see what happens.

12:51.718 --> 12:53.219
We're being followed.

12:53.219 --> 12:54.596
Are you still excited?

12:54.596 --> 12:56.055
No, I'm upset.

12:56.055 --> 12:57.098
Good.

12:57.098 --> 12:58.683
Then we're on the same page.

13:06.774 --> 13:08.860
Open up. It's the R.A.

13:09.944 --> 13:11.529
Yeah?

13:11.529 --> 13:13.615
It's quiet hours.
You have to turn the music off.

13:13.615 --> 13:15.450
Says who?
Me, the R.A.

13:15.450 --> 13:17.160
You probably didn't hear me
over the music.

13:17.160 --> 13:21.748
Maybe this will convince you.

13:21.748 --> 13:23.082
Her cursive is
maybe questionable,

13:23.082 --> 13:24.876
but trust me,
my authority is not.

13:27.962 --> 13:30.465
♪ I know, yeah... ♪

13:30.465 --> 13:32.532
Joke's on you.
I have Scotch tape.

13:35.422 --> 13:37.180
I don't see him anywhere.
Do you?

13:37.180 --> 13:39.557
Nope.
Oh, man.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.768
Well, now that
that's over, I'm starting

13:41.768 --> 13:43.645
to feel the excitement again.

13:43.645 --> 13:45.772
Crazy, right? I think
that's the way danger works.

13:45.772 --> 13:48.483
Oh, it's like a rollercoaster.

13:48.483 --> 13:50.109
Well,

13:50.109 --> 13:53.029
ain't this a coincidence.

13:53.029 --> 13:54.656
Oh, come on.

13:57.742 --> 13:59.661
What's up?
Mom and Dad are being weird.

13:59.661 --> 14:00.954
Can I hang out here?

14:00.954 --> 14:02.497
Actually, ain't a good time.

14:02.497 --> 14:03.748
Come on in, Missy.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.001
Dang it.

14:07.001 --> 14:08.670
Sucker.

14:08.670 --> 14:09.671
Good.

14:09.671 --> 14:11.089
Ooh, Look Who's Talking.

14:11.089 --> 14:13.341
Classic.
Hey, did you know

14:13.341 --> 14:15.176
the baby is the guy
from Die Hard?

14:15.176 --> 14:17.553
No.
Yeah.

14:17.553 --> 14:18.888
He can do everything.

14:18.888 --> 14:19.973
I was sitting there.

14:19.973 --> 14:21.474
Yeah, well, now you're not.

14:21.474 --> 14:22.976
I'm being nothing but nice here.

14:22.976 --> 14:24.185
I don't know why
you got to give me a hard time.

14:24.185 --> 14:26.688
Why? I'll tell you why.

14:26.688 --> 14:29.357
You ruined my life.
Is that enough "why" for you?

14:29.357 --> 14:30.942
Hey, you weren't so innocent.

14:30.942 --> 14:33.194
If I recall, you provided
alcohol to a minor-- me.

14:33.194 --> 14:34.570
That's illegal.

14:34.570 --> 14:37.115
You lied about your age.
You lied first.

14:37.115 --> 14:39.325
Okay, you know what? Let's not
do this in front of your sister.

14:39.325 --> 14:41.703
It actually feels normal.
Keep going.

14:41.703 --> 14:44.580
And let's not forget, I only
lied 'cause you're hot.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.499
Oh, my God.
We don't need

14:46.499 --> 14:48.042
to watch a movie
about a talking baby.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.460
You're right here.

14:51.212 --> 14:52.463
Ooh, lock the door,
lock the door.

14:52.463 --> 14:54.966
No one's home.
Just in case.

14:58.553 --> 15:00.555
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm. Mmm.

15:00.555 --> 15:04.183
I have a wild and crazy idea. Ooh,

15:04.183 --> 15:05.810
I like where this is headed.

15:05.810 --> 15:08.813
Let's make a baby.

15:08.813 --> 15:11.441
You're kidding, right?

15:11.441 --> 15:15.695
I don't know. It might
be fun to start over.

15:15.695 --> 15:18.031
Fun?
What house you been living in?

15:18.031 --> 15:22.118
I'm serious. We've been
getting along so great,

15:22.118 --> 15:25.204
and I have all this
extra time on my hands.

15:25.204 --> 15:27.165
Uh, let's take advantage.

15:27.165 --> 15:29.751
Your son's about to have a baby.
You can take care of that one.

15:29.751 --> 15:31.252
No, my mother called dibs.

15:31.252 --> 15:33.254
Your mother's
a million years old.

15:33.254 --> 15:34.589
You think she's gonna be
changing diapers

15:34.589 --> 15:36.758
in the middle of the night?

15:36.758 --> 15:38.051
I'll tell you
what your problem is.

15:38.051 --> 15:39.510
you got kicked out
of your church,

15:39.510 --> 15:41.345
your-your kids are grown up,

15:41.345 --> 15:43.389
you're feeling sorry
for yourself, and,

15:43.389 --> 15:45.641
yeah, you think
a baby'll solve the problem.

15:47.393 --> 15:49.896
Well? Say something.

15:49.896 --> 15:52.648
You make me so mad.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.069
Where you going?

15:56.069 --> 15:58.237
We can still do it mad.

15:58.237 --> 16:01.657
So what do you
want, uh...

16:03.117 --> 16:05.078
Dennis.
Right.

16:05.078 --> 16:07.914
Dennis. Tough name.

16:07.914 --> 16:11.084
So what do you want... Dennis?

16:11.084 --> 16:15.296
Couldn't help noticing you got
Texas plates on that truck.

16:15.296 --> 16:19.425
Operating poker machines
ain't legal in Texas.

16:19.425 --> 16:21.135
So what are you, a cop?

16:21.135 --> 16:24.847
No, no, I'm just a guy who might
call the cops, you know,

16:24.847 --> 16:27.725
if we don't come
to an arrangement.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.102
Can I take your order?

16:29.102 --> 16:30.019
Thank you, honey.

16:30.112 --> 16:32.605
You know, I got a hankering
for chicken fried steak.

16:32.605 --> 16:36.150
Gravy on top,
but only if it's cream gravy.

16:36.150 --> 16:40.613
And the mashed potatoes with
more cream and gravy on top.

16:40.613 --> 16:43.616
And, uh, ice tea
when you can.

16:43.616 --> 16:45.993
No gravy on that.

16:45.993 --> 16:48.121
And how about for you two?

16:48.121 --> 16:51.207
I'm gonna use your restroom.

16:51.207 --> 16:53.626
He knows what I like.

16:53.626 --> 16:55.837
You're leaving?
Uh-huh.

16:55.837 --> 16:58.673
I got to tinkle. Uh.

16:59.674 --> 17:01.676
Uh,

17:01.676 --> 17:05.138
I guess I'll have the waffles,

17:05.138 --> 17:08.141
and the lady will have, um...

17:10.143 --> 17:12.854
...also waffles.

17:13.855 --> 17:16.732
So, what do you think?

17:16.732 --> 17:18.401
Well, Dennis, I'm not
the guy to talk to.

17:18.401 --> 17:22.155
Uh, why don't we wait
for the boss to finish tinkling?

17:25.491 --> 17:28.327
But I do got to tell you,
this is my first shakedown.

17:28.327 --> 17:30.329
Don't think of it
like that.

17:30.329 --> 17:32.328
It's just a
business arrangement.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.959
Well, I've been a businessman
for 38 years,

17:34.959 --> 17:37.712
and I don't think I've ever
been threatened before.

17:37.712 --> 17:39.755
What kind of business you in?

17:42.884 --> 17:45.845
Hello?
Huh?

17:45.845 --> 17:48.264
What kind of business you in?

17:51.100 --> 17:53.102
Groomer.
Hmm.

17:53.102 --> 17:54.812
Dog groomer, yeah.

17:54.812 --> 17:59.775
Cats if you make me, but
I pretty much love the doggies.

17:59.775 --> 18:01.110
You ever do birds?

18:01.110 --> 18:03.863
No. Mm-hmm.
Birds got feathers,

18:03.863 --> 18:06.782
and they're... they're
self-grooming, pretty much.

18:06.782 --> 18:09.410
Yeah, I always thought
cats were self-grooming.

18:09.410 --> 18:12.705
Well, people think that,
but, no. No, you got to...

18:12.705 --> 18:15.082
You got to dip a cat
once in a while.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.419
Well, okay then.

18:18.419 --> 18:21.047
Where are you going?

18:21.047 --> 18:23.591
Dennis, I am really sorry
about this.

18:35.019 --> 18:37.396
May I help you?

18:37.396 --> 18:38.564
There's no hot water.

18:38.564 --> 18:40.107
There is for rule followers.

18:40.107 --> 18:41.274
You can't just turn off
the hot water.

18:41.274 --> 18:42.095
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.638
If you want the benefits
of civilization,

18:43.638 --> 18:45.056
you have to behave
in a civilized manner.

18:45.056 --> 18:46.766
The decision is yours.

18:48.351 --> 18:51.062
I don't need a pen and paper
to take names.

18:51.062 --> 18:53.064
You. What's your name?

18:53.064 --> 18:55.483
You know I'll find out
and there will be consequences.

18:55.483 --> 18:58.569
Hey, what are you...
