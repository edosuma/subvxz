00:01.960 --> 00:04.754
- Kids, come on!
You're gonna be late for school!

00:04.838 --> 00:05.255
- Morning, Steph.

00:05.338 --> 00:09.759
[yawning]

00:09.843 --> 00:12.095
Mmm, what a night!

00:12.178 --> 00:17.016
I went to sleep a boy
and woke up a man!

00:17.100 --> 00:19.936
- James, it is too early in the
morning for whatever this is.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.771
- Time to have me
a man breakfast.

00:21.855 --> 00:26.609
I'm just gonna grab me a cereal
bowl off of this high shelf.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.573
- While you're up there,
would you grab me a glass?

00:31.656 --> 00:36.494
- Stephanie, I got
my first armpit hair!

00:36.578 --> 00:38.079
Check it.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.623
My days of drawing
them in are over.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.792
- Aw, it's so cute!

00:42.876 --> 00:45.587
- It's not cute.
It's burly. It's manly.

00:45.670 --> 00:49.924
Ohhhhh, Fruity Tutti-O's!

00:50.008 --> 00:52.427
I hope they've got stickers!

00:52.510 --> 00:54.429
- Okay, James, let me
see it again.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.306
- No, you laughed.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.141
- I only laughed because
when I sneezed,

00:58.224 --> 01:01.978
I thought it blew away.

01:02.061 --> 01:04.272
- Gabby, come on!

01:04.355 --> 01:06.107
What is taking that
girl so long?

01:06.191 --> 01:08.318
- I don't know.
Maybe she overslept.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.278
- [groaning]

01:10.361 --> 01:14.616
- Or maybe she got
handcuffed to a mannequin.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.284
- I'm gonna turn you
inside out.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.494
What were you thinking?!

01:17.577 --> 01:19.454
- I was thinking--
what do I get a girl

01:19.537 --> 01:22.832
who put whipped cream
in my sneakers?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.627
- Next time, don't steal
my dessert, fool!

01:25.710 --> 01:27.128
Now unlock me.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.840
I need both hands to get
a good grip on your neck.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.176
- I would, but the key
went out the window--

01:33.259 --> 01:36.971
when I threw it.

01:37.055 --> 01:40.642
- Stephanie, jump in
any time now.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.477
- You know what? No.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.020
You two do nothing but fight

01:44.103 --> 01:46.356
and I am sick of
playing referee.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.817
So, work it out, or don't.
I don't care.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.153
But right now, get in the car
because I'm leaving for school.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.530
- I'm handcuffed to a dummy.

01:53.613 --> 01:57.200
- So is that thing.
You don't hear it complainin'.

01:57.283 --> 02:04.707

02:04.791 --> 02:06.459
♪ Yeah Hey ♪

02:06.543 --> 02:11.214

02:19.055 --> 02:21.641
{\an8}- I just saw that
there is a class action suit

02:21.724 --> 02:24.769
{\an8}against the company
that makes this raincoat.

02:24.853 --> 02:29.190
{\an8}Apparently, the seams come
apart and people get wet.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.321
{\an8}- This is why they shouldn't let
crazy people on the internet.

02:35.405 --> 02:41.703
{\an8}- And just for that--when I get
my hands on my chunk

02:41.786 --> 02:43.121
{\an8}of that $57 million...

02:43.204 --> 02:47.125
{\an8}you're not getting invited

02:47.208 --> 02:50.879
{\an8}- Oh, I didn't realize this
involves you moving.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.090
{\an8}By all means--get rich quick!

02:55.091 --> 02:58.678
{\an8}- Well, not as quick
as you think.

02:58.761 --> 03:03.975
{\an8}I've been trying for hours
to rip this thing!

03:05.810 --> 03:07.103
- Why don't you just cut it?

03:07.186 --> 03:10.523
- Because, in order
to get the money,

03:10.607 --> 03:14.861
it has to rip from
natural causes.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.697
And, so, I need
a natural cause.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.743
A-a-a-a-aron!

03:21.826 --> 03:24.037
- Hi, Grandma Maggie.
- Ah!

03:24.120 --> 03:27.582
- Aaron, sweetie, where
is your sleeve?

03:27.665 --> 03:32.295
- I don't know.
It was there at lunch.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.797
- Cha-ching!

03:35.381 --> 03:38.343
Here, go be you in this.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.597
- JAMES: Ahhhhh!

03:42.680 --> 03:44.057
Give it back! Give it back!

03:44.140 --> 03:45.934
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
What is going on here?

03:46.017 --> 03:47.143
- You didn't punish James
for the dress dummy,

03:47.226 --> 03:48.978
so I'm taking the law
into my own hands.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.065
- That's my new game,
Death Boy VII.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.651
I haven't even played it yet
and she's gonna break it.

03:54.734 --> 03:59.113
- Huh. Bummer.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.114
- Bummer?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.492
Mom and Dad getting
divorced was a bummer.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.411
This is Death Boy VII!

04:05.495 --> 04:09.916
- Wait, so if I break his game,
you're totally cool with that?

04:09.999 --> 04:11.834
- I told you I am not
playing referee.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.419
It's between the two of you.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.005
Just do me a favor and sweep up
the pieces afterwards.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.050
- Ah, revenge with
no repercussions?

04:19.132 --> 04:19.884
[laughing]

04:19.968 --> 04:22.512
Then let the game begin--

04:22.595 --> 04:23.680
I mean end.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.600
- [disc snaps]

04:27.684 --> 04:28.810
- Do something!

04:28.893 --> 04:32.605
You're a grown up lady.
That's what you're for.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.400
- You're a grown up, too.
You got a hair.

04:35.483 --> 04:40.947
- And Gabby's got a moustache.
What's your point?

04:41.030 --> 04:42.782
- I'm sure you and your
sister will be able to

04:42.865 --> 04:46.202
find common ground without
me getting in the middle.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.413
- I'm gonna get you
back so good,

04:48.496 --> 04:50.790
you'll be sorry
I was ever born.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.917
- I'm already sorry
you were ever born.

04:53.001 --> 04:57.213
- There you go--
common ground.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.721
- Hey, these, uh, sheets
are really soft.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.888
- New fabric softener.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.725
- Ah, nice choice.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.518
By the way, you're
ruining my children.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.981
- Charlie, Gabby and James
won't stop fighting

05:15.064 --> 05:17.859
and I can't take it anymore.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.694
I'm out of it.
- You're a parent.

05:19.777 --> 05:20.695
You don't get to
be out of it.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.239
We're like the guardrails
that keep 'em from

05:23.322 --> 05:24.699
goin' over a cliff.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.492
- Well, that's the problem.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.578
They know the guardrails
are there.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.079
I say remove them.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.330
They'll see the edge,
get scared,

05:31.414 --> 05:34.000
and steer themselves
back onto the road.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.919
- [laughing]
You really believe that?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.337
You really believe that.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.131
- Charlie, I'm the one who's
home with them all day

05:40.214 --> 05:43.092
while you're off doing
who knows what?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.553
- Surgery. The word is surgery.

05:45.636 --> 05:50.475
- I know what you do, Charlie,
and I'm doing this.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.934
And I need you to
support me.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.812
- [sighing]
Fine. We'll try it your way.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.522
- Thank you.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.442
- But if they don't work it out,
I've got $20 on James.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.076
- What is that?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.870
- Behold, the TS-7000,

06:10.953 --> 06:12.955
the most powerful shredder
known to man.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.917
It's what the CIA uses

06:16.000 --> 06:19.003
when they don't want the FBI
all up in their business.

06:19.087 --> 06:23.091
I get $10 off because
I had a coupon.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.009
- And what do you need it for?

06:25.093 --> 06:29.222
- Allow me to demonstrate its
awesome and destructive power.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.641
I know you don't need this
magazine about beauty tips.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.977
It's a lost cause.
- [gasping]

06:35.061 --> 06:37.897
- [shredder whirring]

06:37.980 --> 06:40.483
- Do you mind?
I was reading that.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.611
- Ah, yes, I just finished
a bit of reading, myself.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.155
You know they say you shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.117
And I think they are right.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.328
- [gasping]
That's my diary!

06:52.411 --> 06:53.830
- No, that's the cover
of your diary.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.416
This is your diary.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.793
- You wouldn't dare!

06:58.876 --> 07:00.670
- I'll start with Chapter 1--

07:00.753 --> 07:03.089
"I want to marry
Big Time Rush big time."

07:03.172 --> 07:07.552
- Give me--
- Uh-uh-uh!

07:07.635 --> 07:11.097
- Steph, come in here quick, if
you wanna say goodbye to James.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.765
- Oh, she's not
gonna do anything.

07:12.849 --> 07:13.808
Remember?

07:13.891 --> 07:16.018
Bundle up, 'cause I'm
about to make it snow

07:16.102 --> 07:17.979
your innermost thoughts.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.690
- What's going on?

07:20.773 --> 07:21.858
- What...? What is that thing?

07:21.941 --> 07:26.362
- Behold, the TS-7000,
the most powerful shredder--

07:26.445 --> 07:29.282
- He's gonna shred my diary.
He read it, too.

07:29.365 --> 07:34.078
- Really? What'd
she say about me?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.998
- It was a rough start,
but you grew on her.

07:37.081 --> 07:41.460
- James, put those pages down.
- Charlie...

07:41.544 --> 07:44.046
- Or...

07:44.130 --> 07:46.966
you know,
do whatever you want.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.050
- Dad, you can't be serious.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.761
Those pages are irreplaceable.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.890
- It's her diary.
- Nope. No guardrails.

07:53.973 --> 07:58.227
- [gasping]

07:58.311 --> 08:01.230
- Do your worst.
- For real?

08:01.314 --> 08:05.151
Huh.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.487
You know what?
I'm better than this.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.822
Here you go, Gabby.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.033
Oh, and by the way,
that thing on page 27?

08:12.116 --> 08:13.910
You should be worried.
It's not that common.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.661
- [gasping]

08:18.414 --> 08:21.459
- Okay, this one's
for the money.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.295
One...two...

08:24.378 --> 08:26.422
pull!

08:27.548 --> 08:30.426
- Hey, Aaron, time to
get ready for school.

08:30.509 --> 08:33.221
- Oh, school.
That means more kids.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.347
Don't forget to wear your coat.

08:34.429 --> 08:36.890
- Maybe I don't need
to go to school

08:36.974 --> 08:40.144
if I'm getting a third
of $57 million.

08:40.227 --> 08:43.397
- Oh, and how much
is a third of 57?

08:43.481 --> 08:47.568
- Maybe I need to go to school.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.195
- While you're there,

08:49.278 --> 08:51.197
figure out why you think
you're gettin' part of my money.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.450
- Is there coffee?
- Yeah.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.160
I'll get you a cup.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.204
Would you like some
no-kids-fighting-with-that?

08:58.287 --> 09:01.958
Perhaps a packet of
I-told-you-so.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.251
- Black's fine.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.628
- Are you sure you don't want me
to stir in some guardrails?

09:05.711 --> 09:10.258
Oh, yeah, we just found
out we don't need them.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.260
- Well, I'm thrilled
you were right.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.011
What I wasn't thrilled with
was you waking me up

09:14.095 --> 09:15.179
to brag about it
at 4:00 in the morning,

09:15.263 --> 09:17.807
which is why I need the coffee.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.892
- Would you like
some guardrails?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.060
Oh, right, I already
did that one.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.230
- Good morning, family.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.357
- James, we just wanna
say how proud we are

09:26.440 --> 09:27.900
that you worked things
out with your sister.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.193
- You guys were totally right.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.529
Shredding her diary would
have been a mistake.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.322
- GABBY: Ja-a-a-a-ames!

09:41.080 --> 09:43.082
- What? I said I was
better than this.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.293
This is better.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.505
- Ooh, can I get in
on that fruit?

09:49.588 --> 09:51.716
- Yeah, I'll cut you
up an apple.

09:51.799 --> 09:52.675
Wait, I had one right here.

09:52.758 --> 09:57.179
- [door slams open]
- AARON: [groaning]

09:57.263 --> 09:59.432
Sorry about that.
I got hungry.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.142
- What are you doing
down there?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.602
- It's dangerous upstairs
with Gabby and James.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.521
- It's early in the morning.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

10:05.604 --> 10:06.897
Why don't you go upstairs
and get ready for school?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.649
- Okay.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.991
- This has gone too far.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.035
- No, it's working.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.995
I've got the kids
right where I want them.

10:21.078 --> 10:24.540
- Where, sleeping next
to a Crockpot?

10:24.623 --> 10:27.835
- Dad, I need your help.
You're an expert on hair loss.

10:29.253 --> 10:32.214
- Ouch. But continue.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.924
- Please tell me that when
one hair falls out,

10:34.008 --> 10:34.967
two grow back in its place.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.678
- If that were true,
I'd still have my dreads.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.057
- What happened?
- Look at it!

10:41.140 --> 10:43.059
It's bare! My valley
has no shrubs!

15:57.039 --> 16:00.292

some of the--all of it.

tomorrow and it's important.

get into Honors History.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.593

every single sentence?

16:09.677 --> 16:10.761
- Yep, it took me
all afternoon--

16:10.844 --> 16:12.513
and I deleted your

researching this paper.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.862
I'm gonna fail!

that charity guy away,

to sleep in anymore.

gonna keep this up

the other one in?

It's just I always
wanna fight with you.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.448

17:12.531 --> 17:15.701
- Why is that?
- Because you're awful.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.244
Or maybe because we're stuck

17:18.328 --> 17:21.457

we didn't have each other,

17:21.540 --> 17:24.001
we always will.

have printed out a copy

before I deleted it.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.973
I was gonna give it to
you after you failed.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.102

Let's think of three things
we really like about each other

17:44.229 --> 17:45.814
but not say them out loud

17:45.898 --> 17:47.733

them against each other.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.986
- Deal.
- Okay.

weapons, a family meeting.

- Dad, it's not necessary.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

I know I said we were
staying out of it,

17:58.410 --> 18:00.037

with in this house.

it--just like you wanted.
