00:50.340 --> 00:52.580
Here.

00:54.460 --> 00:59.220
Ah, I love the smell of wasted
potential first thing in the morning.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.780
Hey, you can't do that.
Sorry.

01:04.420 --> 01:09.100
As for you two, you'll both be coming
back here every week

01:09.100 --> 01:10.820
until all traces of that smell

01:10.820 --> 01:13.500
that you concocted in the science lab
has been eradicated.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.220
Now, ask yourself,
was it really worth it?

01:17.340 --> 01:19.140
Yes, sir.
Definitely.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.860
And you, Beth, one day you'll find
that merely being pretty

01:26.860 --> 01:31.340
doesn't get you quite as far
in life as you think.

01:31.340 --> 01:33.940
I'm going on X-Factor
and then I'll be famous.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.500
I don't need exams for that.

01:36.500 --> 01:40.420
A succinct, if depressing,
mission statement.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.100
I'll be back in one minute.

01:43.620 --> 01:47.060
If anyone talks or moves
while I'm away...

01:50.500 --> 01:52.500
..I'll know.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.340
(WHISTLES MERRILY)

02:09.340 --> 02:10.900
Oh...

03:04.700 --> 03:06.180
Agh!

03:57.780 --> 03:59.700
Leaving so soon?

04:02.980 --> 04:05.740
I guess we still have some work
to do on this whole trust issue.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.300
I have to find Ethan.

04:07.300 --> 04:11.140
I'm going to get out of bed now, so
you might want to avert your eyes.

04:16.980 --> 04:21.700
Were you going to walk around this
city till you bumped into this Ethan?

04:22.860 --> 04:24.740
Here.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.780
There's eight million people
out there.

04:27.780 --> 04:29.820
Good luck.

04:30.940 --> 04:33.460
Or I could make us a cup of coffee
and we'll have a chat.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.700
Don't be so worried.

04:35.700 --> 04:39.020
Abby would have called
if your anomaly was closing.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.700
My shirt looks good on you,
by the way.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.660
It was all I could find.

04:43.660 --> 04:46.540
Yes, sorry about that.
All my skirts are in the wash.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.500
Was that an attempt at humour?

04:49.620 --> 04:51.980
Well, I've had bigger laughs,
but, yeah.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.860
I prefer tea.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.780
Tea.

05:02.220 --> 05:05.100
Abby, have you heard from Matt yet?

05:05.100 --> 05:07.820
He'll get here by three.
We have to trust him.

05:07.820 --> 05:09.900
We hardly know him.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.780
Philip's coming to see me.
I know, I heard.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.660
Philip rocks. He's like the smartest
man I have ever met.

05:16.660 --> 05:19.420
You're beginning
to sound like a groupie.

05:19.420 --> 05:24.420
I am a groupie, just without the
sordid bits and the low self-esteem.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.620
Abby, if Philip's taking an interest
in the creatures,

05:28.620 --> 05:30.740
then it can only be a good thing,
right?

05:31.980 --> 05:33.460
Hmm.

05:35.820 --> 05:38.180
We discussed this, James,
you agreed to the policy.

05:38.180 --> 05:41.300
We can't risk a repeal of the airlock
fiasco. I was nearly killed in there.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.420
I think you'll admit human error
played its part in that.

05:44.420 --> 05:48.060
The creatures present an ongoing and
potentially uncontrollable threat.

05:48.060 --> 05:50.020
Now, if you have a better solution?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.860
So, how do you feel
about the situation?

06:02.860 --> 06:06.260
The creatures, I mean.
To be honest, it's not great.

06:06.260 --> 06:09.220
They need natural light, greenery,
more space.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.260
how many of them do you think will
ever make it home? Most of them.

06:13.260 --> 06:16.020
But not all of them.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.740
They'll be forced
to live a miserable life

06:17.740 --> 06:19.940
in a world they don't understand.

06:19.940 --> 06:23.540
I'm glad we're agreed something
needs to be done. Absolutely.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.900
I've er...

06:25.900 --> 06:28.500
I've put together a proposal.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.340
I think we have to consider
putting them down.

06:32.540 --> 06:36.300
It's the only humane solution.
It's the safest,

06:36.300 --> 06:38.740
the kindest course of action.

06:38.740 --> 06:40.300
What do you think, Connor?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.980
Er...

06:43.980 --> 06:45.500
Hang on.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.500
All of them, even Rex?

06:49.500 --> 06:52.020
I'm glad we've had a chance
to talk this through.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.020
Thanks.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.620
I feel better.

07:05.740 --> 07:07.700
Listen, I'm sure we can -
(EMERGENCY HOOTER)

07:14.420 --> 07:16.140
Abby.
What?

07:16.140 --> 07:18.260
What if we can't get
the creatures back?

07:18.260 --> 07:21.620
You agree with him? No, no,
I'm just trying to see all sides.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.540
Coordinates: 9-9-1-6-2.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.340
He wants to kill Rex.

07:26.340 --> 07:28.980
Abby, now is not a good time
to be getting all emotional.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.980
I can talk to Philip later.
Connor...

07:33.420 --> 07:35.500
I can't leave
while this is happening.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.500
And I wouldn't want to slow you down
by being emotional.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.460
Abby, that's not fair, I -
Connor...

07:41.460 --> 07:43.300
With me.

07:44.420 --> 07:49.100
Distance: 8.6 miles;
heading two six two.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.060
(PHONE RINGS)

07:54.300 --> 07:57.220
Yeah? 'Matt, anomaly alert.
JP School, Thornton Street.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.980
'The others are on their way.'
OK.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.780
Text me the location.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.540
What is that?
Tracking device to find me.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.940
Look, I'm going to have to go.
Is it the gateway?

08:04.940 --> 08:06.900
It's not yours, there's a new one.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.500
Can I trust you to stay here? When I
get back, we can find Ethan together.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.060
You have my word.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.500
I promise.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.820
While you're here,
you can draw a picture of Ethan.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.380
She's really fit.
What are you doing?

08:50.340 --> 08:53.620
I'm going to chat her up.
Oh, you've got no chance.

09:02.780 --> 09:06.180
Darren, ask yourself one question.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.380
Outside of a Seth Rogen film,

09:08.380 --> 09:12.180
is a girl as hot as me really going
to fall for a tragic geek like you?

09:20.700 --> 09:22.380
That was truly ugly.

09:25.620 --> 09:29.820
Where are you going? Anywhere
you two pathetic losers aren't.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.100
Phew.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.940
Well, I can see
why you like her so much?

09:37.940 --> 09:40.100
(TYRES SCREECH)

09:53.820 --> 09:55.940
She needs taking down a peg.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.140
And I know how to do it.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.020
Where are we going?

10:01.060 --> 10:03.180
Wait and see.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.260
I've located the anomaly. In the
canteen, other side of the school.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.780
Jess, I'll radio in
if we need backup.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.700
Copy that.
What have we got?

10:18.740 --> 10:21.700
The anomaly is in the canteen.
On the other side of the school.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.580
No sign of creature incursion yet.

10:23.580 --> 10:26.260
Where's Abby?
Something came up.

10:26.260 --> 10:28.660
Jess, I can see cameras.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.940
There's a central system. It
controls the CCTV and all the doors.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.420
I'm hacking it right now.

10:33.420 --> 10:36.140
'You'd make a great bank robber.'
I'll consider it.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.820
Ah, sweet.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.660
If they catch us in here,
we'll get detention forever.

10:52.660 --> 10:54.940
It'll be worth it.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.660
Hi, I'm Beth and this
is my audition for X-Factor.

11:04.660 --> 11:08.060
From her phone to every screen saver
in the school.

11:13.220 --> 11:16.780
She's rank.
Yep.

11:21.340 --> 11:23.540
Why do all schools smell the same?

11:23.540 --> 11:26.540
Like spot cream and misery.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.300
I quite liked school.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.900
Yeah, that figures.

11:31.020 --> 11:32.780
What about you, Matt?

11:32.780 --> 11:34.620
How were your school days?

11:34.620 --> 11:37.620
I don't remember.
Come on, everybody remembers school.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.660
Not me.

11:39.660 --> 11:42.020
Let's get this anomaly locked
and get out of here.

11:42.020 --> 11:44.620
You don't like talking about
yourself much, do you? No.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.380
So much for a quiet dead school.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.660
I don't believe it. It's the cops.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.980
Jess, we've got an incursion.

12:22.220 --> 12:24.060
We'll keep you posted.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.180
My dad will kill me if I get brought
home by the police.

13:04.340 --> 13:06.660
'Jess, any activity
with the anomaly?'

13:07.740 --> 13:09.220
Negative.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.700
Hang on.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.740
What are you doing?

13:14.740 --> 13:16.540
Jamming the locking system.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.860
(RATTLES DOOR)
'Connor, what's happening?'

13:38.940 --> 13:41.140
All you've done is lock them in.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.180
Jess, something triggered
the security locks.

13:43.180 --> 13:45.860
Any bright ideas?
We could leg it.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.340
All right.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.800
I know, I know. It sucks.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.560
But you don't want to think about
the alternative, trust me.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.240
Come on.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.120
Rex.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.040
I really need your help on this.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.040
Come on.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.640
Thanks.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.040
Do you think we should check Beth
and Mr George are OK?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.680
Are you kidding?
We're staying right here.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.040
Why is the arm all purple?

15:12.040 --> 15:14.880
The creature must have used some sort
of venom to bring him down.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.840
And you saw that thing. Like some
sort of evil, rabid, mutant dog.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.560
We should check they're OK.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.680
Jess, could the anomaly be
interfering with the locks?

15:26.680 --> 15:30.000
Looks like the system's crashed.
All the closed doors are locked.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.920
You won't be able
to get to the anomaly.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.360
There seems to be some interference
with the CCTV.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.200
I can reboot the system manually.
Where's the server?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.760
'First floor admin office,
you have a clear path.' OK, do it.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.480
We're going after whatever did this.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.200
Jess, hey.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.720
I need your help now.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.000
'Connor, be careful, it uses a toxic
venom to paralyse its prey.'

15:59.000 --> 16:00.760
Toxic venom, copy.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.400
I need 20 minutes. Just order them
to clear out the loading bay

16:05.400 --> 16:07.200
while I get the creatures out.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.800
What are you going to do
with the mammoth? Put it on a lead?

16:09.800 --> 16:12.920
I'll tranquilize it, put it on
a low loader and drive it out.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.680
Even if you get away with this,
what are you going to do?

16:16.680 --> 16:19.720
I've got contacts at a private zoo.
Jess, please.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.720
I can't do this without you.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.720
'Jess?

16:23.720 --> 16:26.120
'Jess, talk to me, what's going on?'

16:29.520 --> 16:32.280
'Sorry. Corridor on your right,
down to the end and turn left

16:32.280 --> 16:34.320
'and the server room's
up the stairs.'

16:34.320 --> 16:36.720
Copy that, Jess.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.840
We've found a blood trail, Jess.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.920
Keep monitoring the camera feeds.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.280
I saw it. The creature.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.480
'Where did you see it, Jess?
Could you find us a route?'

17:00.480 --> 17:02.600
'It's in the corridor
on the second floor.'

17:11.160 --> 17:15.720
'Matt, there's two kids and they're
heading straight for the creature.'

17:15.720 --> 17:17.440
Go fast!

17:17.440 --> 17:19.760
Where are they? Do we have visual?

17:19.760 --> 17:22.720
'Keep going, keep going.'
Jess, which way now?

17:22.720 --> 17:24.800
Second corridor on the left,
then first right.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.839
'You're nearly there,
just around the corner.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.600
It's locked!
We're trapped!

17:35.040 --> 17:36.720
Keep going down that corridor.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.040
'Keep going,
you'll meet with them any second.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.320
'They're just around the corner.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.680
'You're nearly there.'

17:47.360 --> 17:49.160
It's locked!

17:49.160 --> 17:51.600
Jess, we need a new route now!

17:51.600 --> 17:53.360
I can't see them.
They should be there.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.240
'There's a problem with the CCTV.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.280
'I'm trying to work
on a clearer signal.'

18:04.360 --> 18:06.800
'Jess, I need a visual
on these boys.'

18:19.080 --> 18:21.240
(CLATTERING)

18:34.440 --> 18:36.120
(CLATTER)

18:40.040 --> 18:42.080
I know it's you, Darren. Go away.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.880
'Cameras are back,
but I can't get a clear picture.'

18:54.440 --> 18:56.280
There's another kid.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.320
A girl. She's in the gym.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.680
'Jess, keep an eye on the girl, we're
going to try and find these boys.'

19:26.920 --> 19:28.560
(CLATTERING)

19:32.520 --> 19:34.560
So immature.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.000
(CREAKING)

20:17.840 --> 20:20.520
The creature's in the gym, Matt.
You have to get there now!

20:20.520 --> 20:23.320
Jess, I've located the server room.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.800
I've not seen this system before.
I need a minute.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.920
I need those doors open now. You
don't have a minute, break it down!

20:42.680 --> 20:44.360
(SNARLING)

20:56.720 --> 20:57.920
Agh!

20:57.920 --> 20:59.880
No!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.800

Sorry, Jess, we're too late.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.840

going to bring the creatures out.

Sorry, Abby.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.080
These creatures are too dangerous.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.560
I've just been handed
a major reality check.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.560
I'm sorry.

we've got a major incursion.

We've got a fatality.
We have to find those boys.

OK, I am done here. I've switched
it back on, so once it's rebooted -

We've got a problem.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.080
Make that three problems.

Abby, you've got to stop this now.

Don't blame Jess.

25:58.740 --> 26:00.580
She was frightened
of you getting hurt.

This is wrong.

No human being in history has seen
these creatures alive before us.

We've been given
the most amazing gift.

26:14.300 --> 26:17.780
And how do we repay that...
that privilege?

By killing them
because they're...

Good to see you supervising
the procedure yourself, Philip.

Don't want any mistakes.

Oh, by the way, you haven't
co-signed this executive order yet.

27:33.620 --> 27:36.860
Ah, yes, and I don't intend to.

Well, I dare say we can't keep
the anomalies secret forever.

One day it will all come out,
whether we like it or not.

After all you've achieved,
to be remembered

28:03.660 --> 28:08.860
simply as Burton the dinosaur killer
does seem rather a cruel fate.

I'd imagine.

Certainly not.

No, I'm simply saying
that if this should somehow

28:20.860 --> 28:22.980
ever become public knowledge,

28:22.980 --> 28:25.780
the world beyond these walls
