00:13.263 --> 00:16.688
<font color="#808080">NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON :</font> A generation ago, the astronomer
Carl Sagan stood here...

00:16.850 --> 00:20.946
...and launched hundreds of millions of us
on a great adventure.

00:21.104 --> 00:25.234
The exploration of the universe
revealed by science.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.528
It's time to get going again.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.248
We're about to begin a journey
that will take us...

00:31.406 --> 00:33.750
...from the infinitesimal
to the infinite...

00:33.909 --> 00:36.628
...from the dawn of time
to the distant future.

00:36.787 --> 00:40.462
<i>We'll explore galaxies
and suns and worlds...</i>

00:40.624 --> 00:43.969
<i>...surf the gravity waves of space-time...</i>

00:44.127 --> 00:47.381
<i>...encounter beings that
live in fire and ice...</i>

00:47.548 --> 00:51.143
<i>...explore the planets of
stars that never die...</i>

00:51.301 --> 00:53.770
<i>...discover atoms as massive as suns...</i>

00:53.929 --> 00:57.524
<i>...and universes smaller than atoms.</i>

00:57.975 --> 01:01.070
<i>Cosmos is also a story about us.</i>

01:01.687 --> 01:05.157
<i>It's the saga of how wandering bands
of hunters and gatherers...</i>

01:05.315 --> 01:08.990
<i>...found their way to the stars.</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:13.665
<i>One adventure with many heroes.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:26.178
To make this journey,
we'll need imagination.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.384
But imagination alone is not enough...

01:28.547 --> 01:31.676
...because the reality of nature
is far more wondrous...

01:31.842 --> 01:33.810
...than anything we can imagine.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.603
This adventure is made possible
by generations of searchers...

01:41.768 --> 01:45.523
...strictly adhering to
a simple set of rules:

01:45.689 --> 01:49.364
Test ideas by experiment and observation.

01:49.526 --> 01:54.498
Build on those ideas that pass the test.
Reject the ones that fail.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.205
Follow the evidence wherever it leads...

01:57.367 --> 01:59.745
...and question everything.

01:59.911 --> 02:05.463
Accept these terms,
and the cosmos is yours.

02:06.543 --> 02:10.264
Now come with me.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.254
In this ship of the imagination...

04:06.413 --> 04:11.761
...free from the shackles of space
and time, we can go anywhere.

04:11.918 --> 04:17.015
If you want to see where we are in space,
just look out the front window.

04:21.303 --> 04:25.854
In the dimension of time,
the past lies beneath us.

04:27.017 --> 04:31.944
Here is what Earth looked like
250 million years ago.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.199
If you wanna see the future, look up.

04:38.361 --> 04:43.618
And this is how it could appear
250 million years from now.

04:44.367 --> 04:48.463
If we're going to be venturing out
into the farthest reaches of the cosmos...

04:48.622 --> 04:51.501
...we need to know our cosmic address.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.170
And this is the first line of that address.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.742
<i>We're leaving the Earth,
the only home we've ever known...</i>

05:20.904 --> 05:25.080
<i>...for the farthest reaches of the cosmos.</i>

05:29.246 --> 05:33.046
<i>Our nearest neighbor, the moon,
has no sky...</i>

05:33.959 --> 05:37.008
<i>...no ocean, no life.</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:40.800
<i>Just the scars of cosmic impacts.</i>

05:53.436 --> 05:56.235
<i>Our star powers the wind and the waves...</i>

05:56.398 --> 05:59.698
<i>...and all the life on the
surface of our world.</i>

05:59.860 --> 06:02.363
<i>The sun holds all the worlds
of the solar system...</i>

06:02.529 --> 06:06.875
<i>...in its gravitational embrace,
starting with Mercury...</i>

06:25.844 --> 06:29.940
<i>...to cloud-covered Venus,
where runaway greenhouse effect...</i>

06:30.098 --> 06:33.523
<i>...has turned it into a kind of hell.</i>

06:39.357 --> 06:40.825
<i>Mars.</i>

06:40.984 --> 06:45.660
<i>A world with as much land as Earth itself.</i>

06:58.585 --> 07:04.843
<i>A belt of rocky asteroids circles the sun
between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:19.652
<i>With its four giant moons
and dozens of smaller ones...</i>

07:19.814 --> 07:23.193
<i>...Jupiter is like its
own little solar system.</i>

07:23.360 --> 07:27.740
<i>It has more mass than all
the other planets combined.</i>

07:37.707 --> 07:40.756
<i>Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</i>

07:41.211 --> 07:44.715
<i>A hurricane three times
the size of our whole planet...</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:47.885
<i>...that's been raging for centuries.</i>

08:08.655 --> 08:12.410
<i>The crown jewel
of our solar system, Saturn...</i>

08:12.575 --> 08:15.419
<i>...ringed by freeways of
countless orbiting...</i>

08:15.578 --> 08:18.081
<i>...and slowly tumbling snowballs.</i>

08:18.248 --> 08:21.843
<i>Every snowball, a little moon.</i>

08:53.283 --> 08:54.785
<i>Uranus...</i>

08:56.911 --> 08:58.959
<i>...and Neptune.</i>

08:59.122 --> 09:00.795

09:00.957 --> 09:04.012

and only discovered</i>

09:04.024 --> 09:07.090
<i>after the invention
of the telescope.</i>

09:08.840 --> 09:10.763
<i>Beyond the outermost planet...</i>

09:10.925 --> 09:15.305
<i>...there's a swarm of tens
of thousands of frozen worlds.</i>

09:32.822 --> 09:36.167
<i>And Pluto is one of them.</i>

09:48.880 --> 09:50.848
<i>Of all our spacecraft...</i>

09:51.007 --> 09:54.307

farthest from home.</i>

09:58.348 --> 10:02.273
<i>She bears a message
to a billion years from now...</i>

10:02.435 --> 10:05.063
<i>...something of who we were...</i>

10:05.230 --> 10:08.450
<i>...how we felt and the music we made.</i>

10:40.890 --> 10:44.190
<i>From out here, the sun may look
like just another star.</i>

10:44.894 --> 10:49.024
But it still exerts its gravitational hold
on a trillion frozen comets...

10:49.190 --> 10:51.943
<i>"leftovers from the formation
of the solar system...</i>

10:52.110 --> 10:55.080
<i>...nearly five billion years ago.</i>

10:55.238 --> 10:57.491
<i>It's called the Oort Cloud.</i>

10:57.657 --> 11:00.331
<i>No one has ever seen it before,
nor could they...</i>

11:00.493 --> 11:02.587
<i>...because each one of
these little worlds...</i>

11:02.745 --> 11:07.546
<i>...is as far from its nearest neighbor
as Earth is from Saturn.</i>

11:08.251 --> 11:12.472
This enormous cloud of comets
encloses the solar system...

11:12.630 --> 11:15.258
...which is the second line
of our cosmic address.

11:21.764 --> 11:26.270
<i>We've only been able to detect the planets
of other stars for a few decades...</i>

11:26.436 --> 11:30.157
<i>...but we already know
that planets are plentiful.</i>

11:30.315 --> 11:33.114
<i>They outnumber the stars.</i>

11:33.276 --> 11:36.450
<i>Almost all of them will be
very different from Earth...</i>

11:36.613 --> 11:38.957
<i>...and hostile to life as we know it.</i>

11:39.115 --> 11:41.459
<i>But what do we know about life?</i>

11:41.618 --> 11:46.124
<i>We've met only one kind so far: Earth life.</i>

11:46.289 --> 11:49.668
See anything? Just empty space, right?

11:50.293 --> 11:54.264
Human eyes see only a sliver of the light
that shines in the cosmos.

11:54.422 --> 11:59.303
But science gives us the power
to see what our senses cannot.

11:59.469 --> 12:03.565
Infrared is the kind of light made visible
by night-vision goggles.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.227
Throw an infrared sensor
across the darkness.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.191
Rogue planet.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.823
World without a sun.

12:13.650 --> 12:18.076
Our galaxy has billions of them,
adrift in perpetual night.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.538
They're orphans,
cast away from their mother stars...

12:21.699 --> 12:24.794
...during the chaotic birth
of their native star systems.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.377
<i>Rogue planets are molten at the core
but frozen at the surface.</i>

12:31.542 --> 12:33.465
<i>There may be oceans of liquid water...</i>

12:33.628 --> 12:36.632
<i>...in the zone between those extremes.</i>

12:40.802 --> 12:44.682
<i>Who knows what might be swimming there?</i>

12:49.644 --> 12:52.568
This is what the Milky Way looks like
in infrared.

12:52.730 --> 12:57.361
Every single dot, not just the bright ones,
is a star.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.034
How many stars?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.869
How many worlds?

13:02.031 --> 13:04.033
How many ways of being alive?

13:05.535 --> 13:09.915
<i>Where are we in this picture?
See that trailing outer arm?</i>

13:10.081 --> 13:11.708
<i>That's where we live.</i>

13:11.874 --> 13:14.844
<i>About 30,000 light-years
from the center.</i>

13:15.003 --> 13:19.884
<i>The Milky Way Galaxy
is the next line of our cosmic address.</i>

13:20.049 --> 13:23.178
<i>We're now a hundred thousand
light-years from home.</i>

13:23.344 --> 13:26.097
<i>It would take light,
the fastest thing there is...</i>

13:26.264 --> 13:29.643
<i>...a hundred thousand years
to reach us from Earth.</i>

13:32.520 --> 13:37.492
This is the great spiral in Andromeda.
The galaxy next door.

13:37.650 --> 13:41.029
We call our two giant galaxies
and a smattering of smaller ones...

13:41.195 --> 13:43.243
...the Local Group.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.592
<i>Can't even find our home galaxy
from out here.</i>

13:54.751 --> 13:58.847
<i>It's just one of thousands
in the Virgo Supercluster.</i>

13:59.547 --> 14:04.394
On this scale, all the objects we see,
including the tiniest dots...

14:04.552 --> 14:05.724
...are galaxies.

14:05.887 --> 14:10.563
<i>Each galaxy contains billions of suns
and countless worlds.</i>

14:10.725 --> 14:14.355
<i>Yet, the entire Virgo
Supercluster itself...</i>

14:14.520 --> 14:18.115
<i>...forms but a tiny part of our universe.</i>

14:19.275 --> 14:23.075
<i>This is the cosmos
on the grandest scale we know...</i>

14:23.237 --> 14:26.537
<i>...a network of a hundred billion galaxies.</i>

14:26.699 --> 14:30.795
<i>It's the last line of our cosmic address.
For now.</i>

14:33.581 --> 14:36.881
Observable universe?
What does that mean?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.637
Even for us, in our ship
of the imagination...

14:39.796 --> 14:43.346
...there's a limit
to how far we can see in space-time.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.806
It's our cosmic horizon.

14:45.968 --> 14:51.020
Beyond that horizon lie parts of the
universe that are too far away.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.900
There hasn't been enough time...

14:53.059 --> 14:56.313
...in the 13.8 billion year history
of the universe...

14:56.479 --> 14:58.573
...for their light to have reached us.

15:01.109 --> 15:04.079
<i>Many of us suspect that all of this...</i>

15:04.237 --> 15:08.287
<i>...all the worlds, stars, galaxies
and clusters...</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:10.793
<i>...in our observable universe...</i>

15:10.952 --> 15:17.927
<i>...is but one tiny bubble in an
infinite ocean of other universes.</i>

15:19.252 --> 15:21.505
<i>A multiverse.</i>

15:22.088 --> 15:25.137
<i>Universe upon universe.</i>

15:25.550 --> 15:28.474
<i>Worlds without end.</i>

15:33.224 --> 15:34.692
Feeling a little small?

15:34.851 --> 15:38.526
Well, in the context of the cosmos,
we are small.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.574
We may just be little guys
living on a speck of dust...

15:41.732 --> 15:44.485
...afloat in a staggering immensity...

15:44.652 --> 15:46.620
...but we don't think small.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.658
This cosmic perspective is relatively new.

15:49.824 --> 15:53.954
A mere four centuries ago,
our tiny world was oblivious...

15:54.120 --> 15:55.997
...to the rest of the cosmos.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.757
There were no telescopes.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.761
The universe was only what you could see
with the naked eye.

16:01.919 --> 16:07.301
Back in 1599, everyone knew that the sun,
planets and stars...

16:07.467 --> 16:11.347
...were just lights in the sky
that revolved around the Earth...

16:11.512 --> 16:15.233
...and that we were the center
of a little universe.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.986
A universe made for us.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.989
<i>There was only one man
on the whole planet...</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:25.072
<i>...who envisioned
an infinitely grander cosmos.</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:27.453
<i>And how was he spending
New Year's Eve...</i>

16:27.612 --> 16:30.115
<i>...of the year 1600?</i>

16:30.823 --> 16:33.793
<i>Why, in prison, of course.</i>

16:42.168 --> 16:44.785
There comes a time in
our lives when we first

16:44.797 --> 16:47.425
realize we're not the
center of the universe...

16:47.924 --> 16:51.144
...that we belong to something
much greater than ourselves.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.145
It's part of growing up.

16:53.304 --> 16:57.901
And as it happens to each of us, so it
began to happen to our civilization...

16:58.059 --> 17:00.027
...in the 16th century.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.109
<i>Imagine a world before telescopes...</i>

17:02.271 --> 17:05.400
<i>...when the universe was only
what you could see with the naked eye.</i>

17:05.566 --> 17:08.490
<i>It was obvious that Earth was motionless...</i>

17:08.653 --> 17:12.657
<i>...and that everything in the heavens, the
sun, the moon, the stars, the planets...</i>

17:12.823 --> 17:14.325
<i>...revolved around us.</i>

17:14.492 --> 17:19.623
And then a Polish astronomer and priest
named Copernicus made a radical proposal:

17:19.789 --> 17:22.041
The Earth was not the center.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.963
It was just one of the planets,
and like them, it revolved around the sun.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.556
Many, like the Protestant reformer
Martin Luther...

17:29.715 --> 17:32.969
...took this idea as a scandalous affront
to scripture.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.603
They were horrified.

17:34.762 --> 17:39.393
But for one man,
Copernicus didn't go far enough.

17:39.976 --> 17:44.322
<i>His name was Giordano Bruno
and he was a natural-born rebel.</i>

17:44.480 --> 17:47.905
<i>He longed to bust out
of that cramped little universe.</i>

17:48.067 --> 17:50.320
<i>Even as a young Dominican monk
in Naples...</i>

17:50.486 --> 17:51.783
<i>...he was a misfit.</i>

17:51.946 --> 17:54.916
<i>This was a time when there was
no freedom of thought in Italy.</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:58.203
<i>But Bruno hungered to know everything
about God's creation.</i>

17:58.369 --> 18:01.213
<i>He dared to read the books
banned by the church...</i>

18:01.372 --> 18:03.340
<i>...and that was his undoing.</i>

18:03.499 --> 18:08.380
<i>In one of them, an ancient Roman,
a man dead for more than 1500 years...</i>

18:08.546 --> 18:12.022
<i>...whispered to him
of a universe far</i>

18:12.034 --> 18:15.521
<i>greater, one as boundless
as his idea of God.</i>

18:19.599 --> 18:20.942
<i>Lucretius asked the reader...</i>

18:21.100 --> 18:23.523
<i>...to imagine standing
at the edge of the universe...</i>

18:23.686 --> 18:25.814
<i>...and shooting an arrow outward.</i>

18:25.980 --> 18:28.859
<i>If the arrow keeps going,
then clearly the universe extends...</i>

18:29.025 --> 18:30.948
<i>...beyond what you thought was the edge.</i>

18:31.110 --> 18:32.908
<i>But if the arrow doesn't keep going...</i>

18:33.070 --> 18:36.040
<i>...say it hits a wall,
then that wall must lie...</i>

18:36.198 --> 18:38.872
<i>...beyond what you thought
was the edge of the universe.</i>

18:39.035 --> 18:42.380
<i>Now if you stand on that wall
and shoot another arrow...</i>

18:42.538 --> 18:44.916
<i>...there are only the same
two possible outcomes:</i>

18:45.082 --> 18:47.505
<i>It either flies forever out into space...</i>

18:47.668 --> 18:49.170
<i>...or it hits some boundary...</i>

18:49.337 --> 18:52.011
<i>...where you can stand and shoot
yet another arrow.</i>

18:52.173 --> 18:55.473
<i>Either way, the universe is unbounded.</i>

18:55.635 --> 18:57.888
<i>The cosmos must be infinite.</i>

34:32.571 --> 34:34.790
...and imperil our civilization.

34:39.828 --> 34:43.002
Remember that asteroid back
in the formation of the solar system?

34:43.164 --> 34:45.257
The one that got nudged
a little to the left?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.340
Well, here it comes.

34:48.335 --> 34:53.684
<i>It's 6:24 a.m. on December 30th
on the Cosmic Calendar.</i>

34:54.384 --> 34:55.851
<font color="#D900D9">(EXPLOSION)</font>

35:01.850 --> 35:05.571
For more than a hundred million years,
the dinosaurs were lords of the Earth...

35:05.729 --> 35:10.200
...while our ancestors, small mammals,
scurried fearfully underfoot.

35:11.026 --> 35:12.778
The asteroid changed all that.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.665
Suppose it hadn't been nudged at all.
It would have missed the Earth entirely...

35:16.823 --> 35:20.293
...and for all we know, the dinosaurs
might still be here, but we wouldn't.

35:20.452 --> 35:23.376
This is a good example
of the extreme contingency...

35:23.538 --> 35:26.007
...the chance nature of existence.

35:28.835 --> 35:32.385
The universe is already more
than 13 and half billion years old.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.050
Still no sign of us.

35:35.216 --> 35:38.390
In the vast ocean of time
that this calendar represents...

35:38.553 --> 35:41.397
...we humans only evolved
within the last hour...

35:41.556 --> 35:46.062
...of the last day of the cosmic year.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.574
<i>11:59 and 46 seconds.</i>

35:55.737 --> 36:00.368
All of recorded history occupies
only the last 14 seconds...

36:00.533 --> 36:05.960
...and every person you've ever heard of
lived somewhere in there.

36:06.581 --> 36:10.711
All those kings and battles,
migrations and inventions...

36:10.877 --> 36:14.427
...wars and loves,
everything in the history books...

36:14.589 --> 36:19.720
...happened here,
in the last seconds of the cosmic calendar.

36:19.886 --> 36:23.891
But if we want to explore
such a brief moment of cosmic time...

36:26.768 --> 36:29.271
...we'll have to change scale.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.675
We are newcomers to the cosmos.

36:50.834 --> 36:55.806
Our own story only begins
on the last night of the cosmic year.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.808
It's 9:45 on New Year's Eve.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.140
Three and a half million years ago...

37:01.302 --> 37:05.102
...our ancestors, yours and mine,
left these traces.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.940
We stood up and parted ways from them.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.855
Once we were standing on two feet...

37:12.021 --> 37:15.241
...our eyes were no longer fixated
on the ground.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.280
Now we were free to look up and wonder.

37:21.489 --> 37:27.872
For the longest part of human existence,
say the last 40,000 generations...

37:28.037 --> 37:32.759
...we were Wanderers, living in small bands
of hunters and gatherers...

37:32.917 --> 37:37.388
...making tools, controlling fire,
naming things...

37:37.547 --> 37:42.599
...all within the last hour
of the cosmic calendar.

37:49.684 --> 37:53.154
To find out what happens next,
we'll have to change scale...

37:53.313 --> 37:59.411
...to see the last minute of the last night
of the cosmic year.

37:59.569 --> 38:04.200
11:59. We're so very young
on the time scale of the universe...

38:04.365 --> 38:06.959
...that we didn't start painting
our first pictures...

38:07.118 --> 38:10.998
...until the last 60 seconds
of the cosmic year...

38:11.164 --> 38:14.839
...a mere 30,000 years ago.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.556
<i>This is when we invented astronomy.</i>

38:24.719 --> 38:27.939
<i>In fact, we're all descended
from astronomers.</i>

38:28.097 --> 38:31.271
<i>Our survival depended
on knowing how to read the stars...</i>

38:31.434 --> 38:33.732
<i>...in order to predict
the coming of the winter...</i>

38:33.895 --> 38:36.364
<i>...and the migration of the wild herds.</i>

38:36.523 --> 38:39.493
<i>And then, around 10,000 years ago...</i>

38:39.651 --> 38:42.575
<i>...there began a revolution
in the way we lived.</i>

38:42.737 --> 38:45.786
<i>Our ancestors learned
how to shape their environment...</i>

38:45.949 --> 38:48.122
<i>...taming wild plants and animals...</i>

38:48.284 --> 38:51.083
<i>...cultivating land and settling down.</i>

38:51.246 --> 38:53.965
<i>This changed everything.</i>

38:54.123 --> 38:59.095
<i>For the first time in our history,
we had more stuff than we could carry.</i>

38:59.254 --> 39:01.677
<i>We needed a way to keep track of it.</i>

39:01.840 --> 39:03.592
<i>At 14 seconds to midnight...</i>

39:03.758 --> 39:07.433
<i>...or about 6000 years ago,
we invented writing.</i>

39:07.595 --> 39:11.395
<i>And it wasn't long before we started
recording more than bushels of grain.</i>

39:11.558 --> 39:13.856
<i>Writing allowed us to save our thoughts...</i>

39:14.018 --> 39:17.113
<i>...and send them much further
in space and time.</i>

39:17.272 --> 39:19.115
<i>Tiny markings on a clay tablet...</i>

39:19.274 --> 39:22.528
<i>...became a means for us
to vanquish mortality.</i>

39:22.694 --> 39:25.288
<i>It shook the world.</i>

39:25.446 --> 39:28.541
<i>Moses was born seven seconds ago.</i>

39:28.700 --> 39:31.203
<i>Buddha, six seconds ago.</i>

39:31.369 --> 39:34.623
<i>Jesus, five seconds ago.</i>

39:34.789 --> 39:38.134
<i>Mohammed, three seconds ago.</i>

39:38.293 --> 39:41.968
<i>It was not even two seconds ago that,
for better or worse...</i>

39:42.130 --> 39:44.804
<i>...the two halves of the Earth
discovered each other.</i>

39:44.966 --> 39:46.968
<i>And it was only in the very last second...</i>

39:47.135 --> 39:50.139
<i>...of the cosmic calendar
that we began to use science...</i>

39:50.305 --> 39:53.434
<i>...to reveal nature's secrets and her laws.</i>

39:53.600 --> 39:57.730
<i>The scientific method is so powerful
that in a mere four centuries...</i>

39:57.896 --> 40:00.183
<i>...it has taken us from
Galileo's first look</i>

40:00.195 --> 40:02.493
<i>through a telescope
at another world...</i>

40:02.650 --> 40:05.449
<i>...to leaving our footprints on the moon.</i>

40:05.612 --> 40:09.617
<i>It allowed us to look out
across space and time...</i>

40:09.782 --> 40:14.288
<i>...to discover where
and when we are in the cosmos.</i>

We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.</i>

40:19.459 --> 40:21.962
Carl Sagan guided the maiden voyage
of Cosmos...

40:22.128 --> 40:23.675
...a generation ago.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.183
He was the most successful
science communicator of the 20th century...

40:27.342 --> 40:29.845
...but he was first and
foremost a scientist.

40:31.596 --> 40:35.601
<i>Carl contributed enormously
to our knowledge of the planets.</i>

40:35.767 --> 40:38.737
<i>He correctly predicted
the existence of methane lakes...</i>

40:38.895 --> 40:41.318
<i>...on Saturn's giant moon Titan.</i>

40:41.481 --> 40:43.950
<i>He showed that the atmosphere
of the early Earth...</i>

40:44.108 --> 40:46.861
<i>...must have contained
powerful greenhouse gases.</i>

40:47.654 --> 40:51.079
<i>He was the first to understand
that seasonal changes on Mars...</i>

40:51.240 --> 40:53.368
<i>...were due to windblown dust.</i>

40:53.534 --> 40:57.289
<i>Carl was a pioneer in the search
for extraterrestrial life...</i>

40:57.455 --> 40:59.298
<i>...and intelligence.</i>

40:59.457 --> 41:02.631
<i>He played a leading role
in every major spacecraft mission...</i>

41:02.794 --> 41:07.550
<i>...to explore the solar system
during the first 40 years of the Space Age.</i>

41:09.467 --> 41:11.561
But that's not all he did.

41:14.514 --> 41:18.485
This is Carl Sagan's
own calendar from 1975.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.489
Who was I back then?

41:24.357 --> 41:26.826
I was just a 17-year-old
kid from the Bronx...

41:26.985 --> 41:28.908
...with dreams of becoming a scientist...

41:29.070 --> 41:32.119
...and somehow the world's most
famous astronomer found time...

41:32.281 --> 41:35.000
...to invite me to Ithaca,
in upstate New York...

41:35.159 --> 41:36.706
...and spend a Saturday with him.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.586
I remember that snowy day
like it was yesterday.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.045
He met me at the bus stop...

41:42.208 --> 41:45.428
...and showed me his laboratory
at Cornell University.

41:45.586 --> 41:50.217
Carl reached behind his desk
and inscribed this book for me.

41:53.177 --> 41:57.353
"For Neil, a future astronomer. Carl."

41:58.182 --> 42:01.231
At the end of the day,
he drove me back to the bus station.

42:01.394 --> 42:02.896
The snow was falling harder.

42:03.062 --> 42:06.407
He wrote his phone number, his home
phone number, on a scrap of paper...

42:06.566 --> 42:08.819
...and he said, "if the
bus can't get through...

42:08.985 --> 42:13.035
...call me and spend the night at my home
with my family."

42:13.197 --> 42:15.450
I already knew
I wanted to become a scientist...

42:15.616 --> 42:17.744
...but that afternoon I
learned from Carl...

42:17.910 --> 42:19.787
...the kind of person I wanted to become.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.340
He reached out to me
and to countless others...

42:23.499 --> 42:28.380
...inspiring so many of us to study, teach
and do science.

42:28.546 --> 42:32.801
Science is a cooperative enterprise,
spanning the generations.

42:32.967 --> 42:37.723
It's the passing of a torch
from teacher to student to teacher.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.268
A community of minds
reaching back to antiquity...

42:41.434 --> 42:43.027
...and forward to the stars.

42:43.186 --> 42:45.609
Now, come with me.

42:45.772 --> 42:49.322
Our journey is just beginning.
