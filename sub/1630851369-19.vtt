I'm Caitlin.
This is my husband, Theo.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.702
Okay, and you must be Zoe.
So what's going on?

10:15.745 --> 10:18.052
We were leaving a restaurant
just outside the city.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.227
We're on a road trip,

10:19.270 --> 10:20.881
we're visiting my sister
in Cleveland.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.405
And Zoe couldn't walk from
the restaurant back to the car.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.668
Some idiot janitor
mopped the bathroom floor

10:25.712 --> 10:26.800
but didn't put a sign up.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.236
So you fell
on the slippery floor?

10:28.279 --> 10:29.716
Well, we didn't
see that happen.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.544
- You don't believe me?
- We don't believe you, no.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.416
I'm sorry,
am I missing something?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.374
Zoe's had a history
of alcohol issues.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.332
We think
that's why she can't walk--

10:37.375 --> 10:38.899
Are you serious right now?

10:38.942 --> 10:41.075
I fell and hurt myself, but you
think I've been drinking?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.643
We can smell it on you, Zoe.
How dumb do you think we are?

10:43.686 --> 10:45.688
Pretty dumb, actually,
because I haven't had

10:45.732 --> 10:47.951
one sip of alcohol in months.
- Calm down.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.780

going on here, yeah?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.590

I'm talking about
him touching you that way.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.291
You think he mistook you
for someone else?

11:23.334 --> 11:24.771
No, I think he
was more confused

11:24.814 --> 11:26.555

given his condition.

have a chat with him.

What's important now
is the health of the baby.

by transfusing him

that's our responsibility,
