00:06.160 --> 00:08.200
<i>I'm here! Yoo-hoo!</i>

00:08.280 --> 00:09.880
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.480 --> 00:12.480
Look out, get the ball.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.600
-Bet you can't get me.
-No!

00:18.680 --> 00:20.240
Okay, stop!

00:22.000 --> 00:25.440
No, you've had your turn.
You're always up. It's my turn.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.400
-Come on!
-Anouk's out.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.400
-No, it's not out.
-Yes, of course you're out.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.680
Those are the rules of the game, okay?
Or I'm not playing.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.920
-Marly.
-Don't be like that.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.640
Okay, I'm not playing anymore.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.120
-Oh, Marly.
-Okay.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.000
Who wants to play
hide and seek?

00:39.680 --> 00:41.240
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.920
You're loud, Marly.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.240
You're far too loud.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.080
But I was only playing.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.720
Who do you think
they'll blame if there's trouble?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.680
They'll be at our door

00:53.760 --> 00:57.040
because "it can only have been
that dark-skinned loudmouth."

00:57.120 --> 00:58.960
And you stand out, Marly.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.200
People like us can't afford to stand out.

01:03.040 --> 01:03.880
Got it?

01:04.920 --> 01:05.760
Got it.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.960
<i>When my parents</i>
<i>chucked me out of the house, I thought,</i>

01:16.040 --> 01:18.720
<i>"Now it's starting, real life."</i>

01:19.280 --> 01:21.880
<i>"Finally, I'm free to do whatever I want."</i>

01:23.600 --> 01:25.360
<i>"Amsterdam is a game reserve</i>

01:25.440 --> 01:29.920
<i>full of fun, handsome men that I can</i>
<i>simply drag up to my little room,</i>

01:31.160 --> 01:33.600
<i>the way a panther</i>
<i>drags its prey up into a tree."</i>

01:41.600 --> 01:44.200
<i>One little problem though,</i>
<i>I was no panther.</i>

01:45.400 --> 01:46.320
<i>I was a chameleon</i>

01:46.400 --> 01:48.440
<i>that changes color at first sight.</i>

01:50.400 --> 01:53.240
<i>So I spent every night alone in bed.</i>

01:56.440 --> 01:58.000
<i>Well, alone…</i>

01:58.640 --> 02:00.600
<i>It was student housing, after all.</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:11.880
Marly.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.600
That's not how I raised you.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.440
Hands above the blankets.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.600
You're not here.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.680
Yes, I am. I can see you.

02:20.920 --> 02:21.760
Go away.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.960
So this is what you left us for.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.520
Bare mess.
Why don't you make it a bit cozier?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.720
You wouldn't let me take anything.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.960
Do you want to pick
your teeth up off the floor? Shut up.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.480
Ah, I'm coming!

02:42.800 --> 02:44.480
<i>Waalstraat.</i>

02:54.400 --> 02:57.760
<i>Yeah, right.</i>
<i>Now you notice me. Moron.</i>

03:01.520 --> 03:05.880
<i>If I ever want to count for something</i>
<i>in this town, I really have to change.</i>

03:41.960 --> 03:43.560
Hey, Frank.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.320
Hey,

03:48.160 --> 03:49.280
gorgeous.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.440
Ah, what is that?

03:53.960 --> 03:55.040
I'm going to take a look.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.320
Hi.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.600
And this one here needs to be--

04:37.680 --> 04:38.720
Ramon!

04:40.640 --> 04:41.480
What?

04:41.560 --> 04:43.400
-Urgent?
-Three hundred lines.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.840
-They have to go in somewhere, right?
-Yeah, can it wait?

04:47.520 --> 04:48.840
It's 12 o'clock.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.280
So…

04:59.560 --> 05:00.440
Hey, Frank.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.040
Hey.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.880
-Marly.
-Marly.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.920
The party at the silo.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.320
Oh, right. Check. Now I remember.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.480
-What can I do for you?
-I start today.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.560
Help me.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.440
With my job.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.720
-Recording a tape. Sure.
-No.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.800
No, you said you had work for me.
Real work.

05:32.640 --> 05:36.960
It's great that you want to come work
for us. The more, the merrier.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.560
I'm really sorry.
I wasn't completely sober at that party.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.920
But we're expanding soon,
and we're bound to need more staff.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.920
So leave your name and telephone number,
and we'll be in touch with you, okay?

05:53.480 --> 05:54.360
We're renovating.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.200
"I'll renovate your face."
That's what I should have said.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.240
Time to get dressed now.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.960
He's not going to call me, is he?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.320
Probably not.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.040
Nina.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.200
Could you please tell Ramon
the meeting's in the lords' chamber.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.600
The lords' chamber?

06:21.680 --> 06:22.640
Check.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.200
Mother fucker.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.920
Okay guys, how fast can we have
those lines up and running?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Maybe we should think about content first.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.360
I don't think people want
300 different porn tapes.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.560
Yeah!

06:42.960 --> 06:45.280
Hey, we could start a joke line too.
Listen up.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.160
-Little Joe's off to hooker's--
-You know what we should do?

06:48.920 --> 06:49.800
Gay lines.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.040
You'd like that, huh? You pervert.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.240
-Dude, you're the biggest homo.
-Oh, shut up.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.400
Seriously, that's a great idea.
Gay lines. Ramon?

07:01.760 --> 07:05.040
Well, I don't know. Having queers
around the place all day long.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.520
-Well, you don't have to listen to them.
-I'm with Ramon.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.000
It has to be fun for us too.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.880
Hey, all those recordings,
how are we going to do it?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.600
We'll do it the way we've always done it.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.160
Johnny writes a few stories,
Nina calls some random broads.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.600
Three hundred lines with one studio?
That will never work.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.520
Sure, we can. We build an extra studio.
We've got plenty of room.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.200
Just tell me where you want it.
I'll sort it out with the architect.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.920
Wait a minute.
Sorry, but that's our department, Frank.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.840
I'm not going to let some designer clown
decide what our studio will sound like.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.880
Okay, let's chuck out the Marshall, right?
And bring in a 24-channel D&R mixing desk.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.360
Yeah, D for dead and R for rot.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.840
Guys, we're not recording
the Concertgebouw orchestra, okay?

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Okay, make it 12 tracks.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.280
But 300 lines is a lot.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.080
It'll be fine, dude.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.560
Frank?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.360
Anouk called.
She needs you at home right now.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.040
-Anouk?
-Yeah, she said it was urgent, so…

07:54.120 --> 07:55.720
She wants you back, Frankie. Hey?

07:57.640 --> 08:00.720
Yeah, this afternoon.
That architect is coming, so…

08:00.800 --> 08:04.360
Don't be a dick. You want her back, right?

08:05.200 --> 08:06.920
-Yeah.
-Well, go on, then.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.280
Hey, Nien.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.920
Want to play?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.320
Hey, is that allowed?
A woman in the lords' chamber?

08:15.840 --> 08:17.360
You call this a lords' chamber?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.800
I think you mean a toddlers' corner.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.640
-Calm down. I'm coming.
-Yeah.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.000
You call this parking or what?

08:45.080 --> 08:46.680
Hey!

08:46.760 --> 08:47.880
Sorry, dear neighbor.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.600
<i>Frank recognized him instantly.</i>
<i>Bram Heimans.</i>

08:51.680 --> 08:54.200
<i>After three successful solo shows,</i>

08:54.280 --> 08:58.080
<i>Bram was the Netherlands' most famous</i>
<i>and most progressive stand-up comedian.</i>

08:58.800 --> 09:01.560
Do you really think that those people

09:01.640 --> 09:03.440
with their big BMWs,

09:03.520 --> 09:06.400
and with their yachts in Saint-Tropez,

09:06.480 --> 09:09.640
do you really think
that those people are any happier?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.640
You bet your freaking ass!

09:11.720 --> 09:12.840
Of course!

09:14.400 --> 09:16.680
A bit of cash, a bit of <i>dinero.</i>

09:16.760 --> 09:18.640
Life is oh, so sweet, right?

09:19.240 --> 09:20.520
-Sorry.
-Hey.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.520
This place was empty for so long.
Force of habit.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.320
But I'll refrain from dumping the <i>voiture</i>
in front of your entrance from now on.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.360
<i>And Frank being Frank,</i>
<i>he immediately smelled an opportunity.</i>

09:31.440 --> 09:34.840
I'll introduce myself.
Frank Stigter. I'm a big fan.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.480
Bram Heimans, but you noticed already.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.880
Listen, we should have
come around sooner to say hello.

09:40.960 --> 09:41.800
No worries, man.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.880
But you are those boys
with those sex lines, aren't you?

09:45.960 --> 09:46.880
That's right.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.360
-Pop in for a chat sometime.
-Sure.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.520
Maybe we can help each other out.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.280
-Sorry, I don't do corporate events.
-No, of course not.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.240
I was thinking about your own hotline.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.080
The Bram Heimans line.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.640
Yeah.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.320
I don't think
anyone would get turned on by that.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.680
Just ask my wife.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.480
It would be
the world's first stand-up comedy line.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.080
You're on radio and TV, aren't you?
So, why not on the phone as well?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.800
You can do a new show every week.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.480
<i>Nobody likes to be associated</i>
<i>with sex lines.</i>

10:18.560 --> 10:20.720
I don't think I'll be able to fit it in.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.200
<i>Least of all</i>
<i>a left-leaning artist like Bram Heimans.</i>

10:25.200 --> 10:27.040
Very nice car.
I can tell you have good taste.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.000
Thank you.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.640
<i>But there was one thing</i>
<i>Frank could do like no other.</i>

10:30.720 --> 10:31.960
Actually, you should

10:32.720 --> 10:34.720
try out the new sports model.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.840
-Yeah?
-It's in a league of its own.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.680
<i>The art of seduction.</i>

10:39.760 --> 10:40.600
Is that right?

10:42.040 --> 10:43.000
Well…

10:43.080 --> 10:46.560
SHAME

10:46.640 --> 10:50.520
The biggest problem
in treating people with sexual issues

10:50.600 --> 10:54.480
is that it is a topic
that is laden with shame.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.240
I'll give you an example.

10:57.320 --> 11:01.200
Is there anyone in the room
who's into anal sex?

11:04.480 --> 11:08.080
See? That's how difficult it is
to talk about sex.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.600
"What will the others think?"

11:10.120 --> 11:12.280
"Is it normal if I say I like anal sex?"

11:12.360 --> 11:15.960
But that kind of openness
is what we ask of our patients.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.480
How often do you masturbate?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.320
What do you fantasize about
when you masturbate?

11:20.400 --> 11:21.240
Yes.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.800
Do you practice anal sex?

11:28.200 --> 11:29.920
My wife is considering it.

11:30.760 --> 11:31.600
And you?

11:32.360 --> 11:33.280
Not after dinner.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.480
To experience how our patients feel,

11:38.560 --> 11:41.080
I'd like to play
the carousel game with you.

11:41.720 --> 11:46.080
Please group in pairs. And remember,
you don't have to answer the questions.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.160
That's exactly what this is about:
discovering where your boundaries lie.

11:58.920 --> 11:59.960
Should I start?

12:03.480 --> 12:05.280
"What do you like most about sex?"

12:07.160 --> 12:08.360
I've never…

12:09.080 --> 12:10.080
Oh?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.000
Never?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.160
Not even with yourself?

12:14.440 --> 12:16.160
Okay, I'll pick another card then.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.960
"Have you ever contracted an STD,
and how did it…"

12:21.560 --> 12:23.800
No. Maybe it's best if you start.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.080
"Do you have any sexual fantasies?"

12:29.840 --> 12:30.680
Yeah.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.880
All people have sexual fantasies,
don't they?

12:40.600 --> 12:43.000
"How many sexual partners have you had?"

12:44.560 --> 12:45.600
Fewer than you.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.240
All right.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.800
Okay. "What do you like about sex?"

12:53.320 --> 12:55.400
To be completely honest,

12:56.040 --> 12:56.880
nothing at all.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.520
-But you have boyfriend after boyfriend.
-Yeah, that's why.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.120
-Really?
-Yeah.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.040
Would you two mind splitting up for now?

13:06.120 --> 13:07.760
There's someone on his own back there

13:07.840 --> 13:10.440
and you already know each other
a bit too well.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.640
-Sure, okay.
-Yes?

13:16.320 --> 13:17.400
So, it's you and me, then.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.640
Unless you're uncomfortable with it.
I totally get it.

13:21.720 --> 13:22.800
-No, it's okay.
-Yeah?

13:22.880 --> 13:23.920
Yeah.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.840
Right, you can start.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.560
Oh, yeah.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.640
"Do you think monogamy
is realistic and achievable

13:36.720 --> 13:38.800
in a marriage
or a long-term relationship?"

13:40.600 --> 13:43.160
Realistic and achievable for many people.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.200
And speaking for yourself?

13:47.000 --> 13:47.840
Very good.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.920
I personally think it's better
not to define a relationship

13:52.000 --> 13:53.680
in terms of exclusivity,

13:53.760 --> 13:56.840
but rather in terms
of what makes it unique.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.240
The relationship I have with my wife
I have with no one else.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.200
Yeah.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.960
DO YOU USUALLY USE CONDOMS?

14:09.360 --> 14:11.800
What was your first
sexual experience like?

14:14.840 --> 14:17.560
-You don't have to answer the question.
-Yeah, no. I know.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.160
No, I could share something about that.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.680
You see…

14:23.960 --> 14:25.080
Okay.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.960
So, I'm not going to tell him this.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.680
But I have always had
a huge fascination for penises.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.040
<i>Not that I had seen that many.</i>

14:34.120 --> 14:36.280
-Marly.
-<i>My parents didn't do nude.</i>

14:36.360 --> 14:37.480
Get out.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.920
<i>But the boy next door did.</i>

14:41.320 --> 14:44.680
<i>And there were books</i>
<i>I could secretly peruse.</i>

14:44.760 --> 14:46.440
<i>I wanted to know so badly</i>

14:46.520 --> 14:49.440
<i>what it would be like to have</i>
<i>one of those things between your legs,</i>

14:49.520 --> 14:52.960
<i>a thing that would just dangle there</i>
<i>and could get hard at any time.</i>

14:53.680 --> 14:56.040
<i>They had a section in </i>Hitkrant,<i> "Heat Up,"</i>

14:56.120 --> 14:57.880
<i>which answered all of my questions.</i>

14:57.960 --> 14:58.800
DO NOT DISTURB!

14:59.840 --> 15:02.200
<i>Unless my mother got to it first.</i>

15:03.160 --> 15:07.880
<i>So I was in no way prepared</i>
<i>for that first giant,</i>

15:09.200 --> 15:10.880
<i>meaty cock.</i>

15:13.240 --> 15:14.800
-Ow!
-Shh.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.720
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

15:17.800 --> 15:20.760
<i>being deflowered</i>
<i>by someone with an oversized dick</i>

15:20.840 --> 15:22.440
<i>isn't something I'd recommend.</i>

15:28.720 --> 15:29.840
<i>That was it.</i>

15:29.920 --> 15:30.960
<i>My first time.</i>

15:31.680 --> 15:33.680
<i>I gave up on it straight afterwards.</i>

15:37.160 --> 15:39.320
Well, I expected a bit more from it.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.240
Yes?

15:45.480 --> 15:47.520
Okay. Very good.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.840
Please change partners, everyone.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.840
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.840
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Good to see you.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.480
New aftershave?

16:24.720 --> 16:27.760
Well, what's up?

16:28.520 --> 16:31.280
She can tell you herself.
She's upstairs in bed.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.000
Hey, Poekie.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.080
Hey.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.200
What's up with you?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.040
I want to die.

16:49.720 --> 16:50.560
Okay, why?

16:52.120 --> 16:54.680
If there was a train here,
I'd jump in front of it.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.400
Hey, Poekie. Hey.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.400
You stink.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.600
No, nothing.

17:07.040 --> 17:07.880
What is it?

17:09.080 --> 17:11.800
Nauseous. So nauseous and it's your fault.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.320
My fault?

17:15.240 --> 17:16.240
I'm pregnant.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.200
Congratulations.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.360
Hey, Anouk.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.920
Whoa, jeez.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.920
I imagined it so differently. I…

17:35.000 --> 17:36.640
Oh, sweet.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.760
No. Go away. Get Natasja.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.680
We really have to make it soundproof.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.720
That's no problem.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.680
Yeah.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.600
Yeah.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.040
This is big enough.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.960
Yeah, we'll put a door in that wall.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.720
So you can enter the studio
from both sides.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.800
-Exactly.
-You're not doing anything here.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.800
This is my office.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.280
Well, I guess you'll still have to move.
Sorry.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.960
-Well, he doesn't do shit anyway.
-Hello, this is research, okay?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.600
-Who writes all the stories around here?
-Ah!

18:07.440 --> 18:09.880
Here you are. The architect's here.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.080
Yeah, I'll be right there.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.040
We'll find you a room, John.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.600
-No worries.
-Goddamn it.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.520
Can I be of assistance?

18:21.360 --> 18:22.520
With your research?

18:38.240 --> 18:40.200
Hi. Alexander.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.400
Ramon.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.880
Frank's not here, so he asked me
to show you around.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.360
Well, this could use
a little more provocation, right?

18:57.440 --> 18:58.320
Provocation?

18:58.400 --> 19:00.040
Yeah, less tame.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.800
Right? This whole space
absolutely screams to be stripped down.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.880
And then maybe create
a great statement piece on this wall.

19:09.040 --> 19:13.560
Something to impress.
A large tapestry or a mural painting.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.560
Yeah, sounds good.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.000
-Shall we start the tour, then?
-Yeah.

19:21.080 --> 19:21.920
Okay.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.280
Well, the light's great.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.640
-Why did she wait to call me?
-She's only just found out.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.320
So you're going to be a dad after all.
Despite your slow sperm.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.320
Who says my sperm is slow?

19:43.400 --> 19:44.920
If you don't have it tested…

19:49.240 --> 19:52.640
Sorry. Congratulations.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.120
You think she'll take me back?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.400
I don't know, Frank.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.600
I'm staying out of that.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.080
But Ramon says
you've been keeping quite busy.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.440
Asshole.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.720
We tell each other everything.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.000
First, figure out what you want, okay?

20:37.040 --> 20:40.120
Hey, Willem. That's Willem.
This is the recording studio.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.160
That's where we record the tapes.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.160
Bookkeeping.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.920
And this is the heart of the company
but that doesn't need any work.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.520
This is my domain.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.160
I'll take a peek anyway.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.000
And how is this your domain?

20:58.600 --> 20:59.760
I'm the engineer.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.120
When we first started,

21:03.200 --> 21:05.560
it was just a bunch
of interconnected answering machines

21:05.640 --> 21:09.800
but soon it will be full
of cassette players. From wall to wall.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.080
-May I?
-Yeah, sure.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.920
That's a playback for us to check…

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
<i>Come on, baby. Come on.</i>

21:17.000 --> 21:19.880
<i>Slide it between my breasts, up and down.</i>

21:19.960 --> 21:22.160
It's the end of the tape,
so there's a lot of…

21:22.240 --> 21:24.520
-<i>Come.</i>
<i>-</i> "Come all over me."

21:24.600 --> 21:27.680
<i>Squirt all over my tits.</i>
<i>Just come.</i>

21:28.880 --> 21:31.080
We're bringing in different lines as well.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.680
Joke lines, weather forecasts
and a stock exchange thing.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.560
<i>Ah! I'm coming!</i>

21:46.240 --> 21:48.320
Do you know that we have met before?

21:48.400 --> 21:49.280
Yes.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.040
At the party at the docks.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.640
So, you do remember.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.000
I don't stick my tongue into just anyone.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.360
Although I hadn't noticed
your wedding ring.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.920
Have you guys
ever considered a gay sex line?

22:09.640 --> 22:11.400
That would make a lot of people happy.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.800
I haven't seen you in a week.
That's all I'm saying.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.880
I have to do everything
by myself with RoXY!

22:19.960 --> 22:21.360
We could have opened a month ago.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.200
-Help, Misch! Calm down, will you?
-I am not calm!

22:42.280 --> 22:44.200
Jan, are you alright?

22:48.640 --> 22:50.040
Who wants to come to The Rijk?

22:51.840 --> 22:54.440
-Sorry, I'm broke.
-Yeah, me too. End of the month.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.360
As if nobody's going to buy us a drink.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.240
That's what she said to me,
and I said, I told you…

23:04.320 --> 23:07.200
-Come on, let's go say hi.
-No, please, let's not.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.440
Then we know for sure
that we don't have to pay.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.640
Hey, Janna.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.640
-Hey.
-Hey, ladies.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.560
Hello.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.920
So, what would you like to drink?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.600
Yeah, 'cause Frank is buying.
He's going to be a dad.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.200
-What?
-Yeah.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.160
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.600
Now he just needs
to make up with his wife, right?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.000
-Well, let's celebrate.
-Shouldn't you be getting home soon?

23:31.080 --> 23:32.800
Does Natasja let you stay out this late?

23:32.880 --> 23:34.040
I'm just messing with you.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.640
I'd like a beer.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.760
-Yeah, me too.
-I'm Frank.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.480
Seriously.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.440
How many people like me
does he see in a day?

23:46.040 --> 23:47.520
Kidding. Hi.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.080
Marly, right? Sorry about this morning.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.760
-Hey, do you want a beer?
-Yeah, sure.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.520
-To the little demon!
-Well, he's not here yet.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.160
-Johnny is a titties man.
-Where did you get that idea, man?

23:59.240 --> 24:01.800
All your stories are all about tits.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.440
Yeah, the story I got last time
was all about tits.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.680
Yeah, and mine
was all about Swedish style.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.600
Swedish style? What's that?

24:08.680 --> 24:11.480
-In between.
-That's Russian style.

24:11.560 --> 24:12.440
Russian style.

24:12.520 --> 24:16.680
In Italian we call it
"coitus <i>alle mammelle."</i>

24:17.760 --> 24:19.760
-Are you from Italy?
-Can't you tell?

24:21.280 --> 24:24.160
Shouldn't you offer
more variety with those lines?

24:26.000 --> 24:26.840
What, sorry?

24:28.080 --> 24:28.920
Hey.

24:30.160 --> 24:34.440
Well, I mean,
not all men are the same, so…

24:34.520 --> 24:37.280
What turns some men on, others might hate.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.880
Just look at the list of paraphilias.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.400
Bro, someone's been studying hard.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.960
-Para-what?
-Special preferences.

24:46.960 --> 24:47.840
Fetishes.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.840
-Like masochism, exhibitionism, voyeurism.
-Yeah.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.560
You could easily
subdivide those lines into,

24:54.640 --> 24:58.320
for instance, a nurses line,
an air hostess line, an S&M line.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.560
Marly Salomon,
would you please keep your big mouth shut?

25:01.640 --> 25:03.360
We did not teach you this.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.760
-The old hooker line.
-Yeah.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.760
The muff line.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.600
-Well, the gay line.
-That one is for Ronnie.

25:10.520 --> 25:11.680
Yeah, well…

25:12.880 --> 25:17.120
Research shows that one in ten men
have had a homoerotic experience.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
-Yeah.
-One in ten?

25:18.280 --> 25:20.480
For one in forty,
it's their sexual preference.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.480
One in thirty.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.640
One in thirty.
Hey, Ramon. That's a lot of people.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.920
Yeah, a lot of people. So?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.920
Yeah, but we have 300 lines
to fill, remember?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.560
And you could even subdivide
into gay and lesbian.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.080
The tomboy line.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.160
-That's the muff line.
-No.

25:36.240 --> 25:40.560
-Sure. Why not?
-Tomboys aren't necessarily gay and…

25:40.640 --> 25:41.840
Still looking for a job?

25:42.960 --> 25:43.880
Yes.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.160
We could use an extra writer.
Twenty guilders per story.

25:51.720 --> 25:55.280
<i>This is what I get</i>
<i>for not keeping my big mouth shut.</i>

25:55.360 --> 25:59.520
<i>Suddenly, creating content for 300 lines</i>
<i>had become my problem.</i>

25:59.600 --> 26:02.960
<i>I needed to come up with 20 sex stories</i>
<i>by the end of the week.</i>

26:03.040 --> 26:04.160
<i>As a test.</i>

26:05.520 --> 26:09.160
<i>I approached the project</i>
<i>like any scientist would.</i>

26:09.240 --> 26:11.800
<i>Step one: a literature review.</i>

26:18.520 --> 26:20.800
I'm sorry, honey. I love you.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.800
<i>Followed by observation.</i>

26:25.680 --> 26:26.880
<i>He wanted to take them.</i>

26:26.960 --> 26:27.880
MAKE-UP SEX

26:27.960 --> 26:30.360
And I said, "Fine, love,
if you want to take my panties home."

26:30.440 --> 26:31.920
"If that's what turns you on."

26:32.000 --> 26:34.560
"But it'll cost you an extra 20 guilders."

26:34.640 --> 26:36.400
"Because I'm not a cheapo."

26:36.480 --> 26:37.600
<i>And field research.</i>

26:37.680 --> 26:38.840
Interesting.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.080
<i>And ultimately,</i>
<i>all this knowledge comes together in</i>

26:51.040 --> 26:52.200
<i>the publication.</i>

27:05.600 --> 27:07.800
Mar, are you coming to class?

27:09.560 --> 27:10.400
Whoa.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.920
-You okay, miss D. H. Lawrence?
-No.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.600
I know nothing about sex.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.680
Don't be silly.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.880
-You know that book by heart.
-Yeah, that's theory.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.040
That's not arousing.
I can't turn that into a story.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.920
Don't take them so seriously, man.
It's not an exam, right?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.560
Yeah, you know me.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.800
It has to be good.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.920
Oh, you're right. This is really bad.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.120
This won't get anyone horny.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.040
Jan.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.480
I just don't know enough about it.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.200
Mar, you just need
to use your own fantasies.

27:54.360 --> 27:57.640
When was the last time
you fantasized about anyone?

28:24.600 --> 28:27.160
You see? Just write about yourself.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.280
Good luck.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.960
Thanks.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.680
The design's by an artist
called Boris van Soest.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.640
High in demand.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.680
Has an exposition in the Stedelijk.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.600
Oh, really?

28:47.400 --> 28:48.360
Thanks, guys.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.440
What this says
is that this is a serious business

28:51.520 --> 28:53.000
with serious, hard-working people.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.040
Yeah.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.240
And we would put it here, right?

28:56.320 --> 28:57.800
-Yeah, right here.
-Uh-huh.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.880
Hey, Alex.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.200
Hi, I'm here
to do a recording for the Bad Boys line.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.440
Okay, you can follow me.
The studio's downstairs.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.040
We started a gay line.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.240
I see.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.800
This is not included
in the price for the remodeling, I guess?

29:15.880 --> 29:17.600
No, it's another thirty thousand on top.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.840
Thirty thousand?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.960
But on a two hundred grand budget…

29:21.040 --> 29:22.040
Two hundred?

29:22.120 --> 29:24.560
It will increase
the value of the property.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.480
We're renting this.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.480
You're renting?

29:29.480 --> 29:30.880
Okay.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.480
Hey, little brother, just in time.
You met our neighbor?

29:38.080 --> 29:39.880
Hi. Bram Heimans.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.600
-Ramon Stigter.
-Ramon is our technical director.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.760
Bram here
just signed up for a year.

29:44.840 --> 29:45.960
I feel like a soccer club.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.760
Yeah,
but I'm way cheaper than Van Basten.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.320
How do you like the sound of this:

29:51.400 --> 29:54.000
"Teledutch presents a stand-up comedy line

29:54.080 --> 29:56.640
with Bram Heimans."

29:58.680 --> 29:59.520
How classy is that?

29:59.600 --> 30:00.440
100,000 GUILDERS

30:00.520 --> 30:02.120
Welcome to Teledutch.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.240
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.000
Frank, can I talk to you for a minute?

30:07.600 --> 30:09.680
About the remodeling. Nice to meet you.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.280
-Frankie, hey.
-Yeah, okay.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.400
Want to hear a joke, Brammie boy?

30:16.480 --> 30:17.400
-A joke?
-Yeah.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.560
I thought we take all decisions together.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.520
Yes.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.480
Is there a problem?

30:28.560 --> 30:31.120
Well, since we seem to be paying
a hundred grand for a joker.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.520
Ramon, that's my department.
I'm not interfering with yours either,

30:34.600 --> 30:36.800
with your studio
and your Neumann and your Sennheiser.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.360
You want to produce top quality too?

30:38.440 --> 30:40.200
Bram Heimans is top quality.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.000
Do you realize
what he can do for our image?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.480
Jokes. Frank, a joke line.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.840
With his fucking stand-up. You think
people will pay 50 cents per minute

30:47.920 --> 30:49.400
to listen to that leftist clown?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.560
-I don't think so, man.
-That's not the point.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.280
It's about what it looks like
on the ads page.

30:54.360 --> 30:59.080
-"Teledutch Presents Bram Heimans."
-Jesus.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.520
Yeah, I'm trying
to give this company a bit of class.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.800
Oh yeah. And so we're restyling
this joint for 200 grand

31:04.880 --> 31:07.280
because you…
because mister wants to buy us class?

31:07.360 --> 31:08.800
Frank, we're renting here!

31:10.920 --> 31:12.880
Have you ever listened
to what's on those tapes?

31:12.960 --> 31:14.040
Like really listened to it?

31:14.120 --> 31:15.680
-You just can't see it.
-What?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.880
We're not a bunch of sex peddlers, man.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.640
Three hundred lines is nothing.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.200
What we're doing is the future.
There's no end to it.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.840
In two weeks time,
we'll open the renewed Teledutch.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.720
And that's just the start. Trust me.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.160
Two hundred grand

31:30.240 --> 31:33.440
is nothing compared to
what you and I are going to be raking in.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.120
Frankie, come on, man.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.520
Hey, Nien. How about another bottle?

32:04.120 --> 32:07.000
Yes, Ramon Stigter for Alexander.

32:07.080 --> 32:10.360
That mural painting
in the reception is a definite go.

32:16.320 --> 32:20.480
<i> Our fantasies tell us something</i>
<i>about our deepest problems and desires.</i>

32:22.360 --> 32:24.960
Why don't you bend over, Mr. Jansen.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.080
<i>That which we allow no one to see.</i>

32:27.160 --> 32:29.920
Yes, sir. I've been very naughty.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.480
Don't look at me,
you miserable scuzzbucket.

32:34.080 --> 32:37.160
<i>Because there's nothing scarier</i>
<i>than baring your all.</i>

32:38.120 --> 32:38.960
And we're recording.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.440
<i>But there's no need</i>
<i>to be yourself.</i>

32:42.280 --> 32:43.960
I'm sitting here with Monique.

32:44.040 --> 32:48.520
And Monique works in the men's
fashion department of a large chain store.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.560
Monique, why don't you tell us
what you look like?

32:53.120 --> 32:57.800
Well, I have this very long,
red curly hair, down to my buttocks.

32:57.880 --> 33:02.160
And I have big fat boobs that sit
very snugly in my tight little blouse.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.960
And at the moment,
I'm wearing this really short skirt

33:05.040 --> 33:08.360
that just shows a glimpse of my buttocks.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.960
Sometimes I can't control myself

33:11.040 --> 33:13.280
then I just have to slip
into the fitting room.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.880
Wow, Monique.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.960
So, that's why I thought,
instead of these stories,

33:19.040 --> 33:20.680
we could do interviews.

33:20.760 --> 33:24.480
And the only thing we need
is a few key words.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.640
"Who, what, where, and when."

33:27.720 --> 33:30.680
So, I'm wearing,
you know, this white uniform.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.400
And underneath,

33:34.320 --> 33:35.600
I'm naked.

33:35.680 --> 33:40.440
So, to summarize, you hear
a conversation between two people,

33:40.520 --> 33:45.240
but our imagination starts working,
which makes it sound all the more real.

33:45.320 --> 33:48.800
So then, you know, I rub down my body
with a nice massage oil.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.720
Yeah?

33:49.800 --> 33:51.800
And then I slowly

33:52.640 --> 33:54.360
let myself slide onto him.

33:55.680 --> 33:59.440
<i>The number of lines</i>
<i>we could come up with was endless.</i>

34:02.680 --> 34:06.680
<i>At night when the kids were asleep</i>
<i>he came into my room.</i>

34:06.760 --> 34:10.840
<i>Yeah, right here!</i>
<i>Take me on the counter! Oh, yes!</i>

34:10.920 --> 34:13.880
<i>Don't look at me,</i>
<i>you miserable little creature.</i>

34:14.560 --> 34:18.680
<i>Yes, I'm coming! Fuck me!</i>

34:18.760 --> 34:21.240
<i> It wasn't just my imagination</i>
<i>that was stimulated.</i>

34:21.920 --> 34:23.160
<i>Even the men got inspired.</i>

34:23.240 --> 34:24.440
Ice cold, boys.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.160
If we're doing audio plays anyway,

34:26.240 --> 34:28.480
then why not add sound effects
to them as well?

34:29.960 --> 34:31.360
Great idea. Come here.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.000
Cat slurping saucer of milk.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.240
<i>And so all of the Netherlands</i>
<i>was jerking off</i>

34:35.320 --> 34:38.640
<i>to the sound of a pussycat</i>
<i>slurping up a saucer of milk.</i>

34:42.280 --> 34:44.000
<i>Open your mouth.</i>

34:44.080 --> 34:45.160
<i>Or the sound of…</i>

34:45.240 --> 34:47.240
<i>Let me pee in your mouth.</i>

34:51.640 --> 34:52.640
That's so good.

34:52.720 --> 34:55.240
Okay, so we'll record two couples
at the same time,

34:55.320 --> 34:57.320
and we'll pretend that they're swingers.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.280
Marly, what do you think?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.800
All of a sudden, I'd become the expert.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.880
Or, as Frank called it, the sexpert.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.160
Yeah, okay. And we'll call it the…

35:09.240 --> 35:10.240
the couples club?

35:10.320 --> 35:12.360
Yeah.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.760
-Good one.
-Yeah, that's a good one.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.680
-<i>Gezellig spel, hè?</i>
-<i>Nou, een zenuwenspel.</i>

35:23.360 --> 35:24.200
<i>Blauw. Prima. </i>

35:24.720 --> 35:26.360
<i>-O, wacht effe,</i>
<i>-Nee, we doen niks.</i>

35:26.440 --> 35:28.880
<i>-Deze kant.</i>
-<i>Ik doe niks.</i>

35:29.720 --> 35:32.720
<i>Wit. Beetje hier. Jij gooien.</i>

35:33.640 --> 35:34.480
Hey.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.520
You're up again.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.000
Can I get you anything?

35:39.640 --> 35:41.080
My body back.

35:44.240 --> 35:47.120
-<i>Niet zo hard gooien.</i>
-<i>Niet zo hard gooien.</i>

35:50.120 --> 35:51.040
<i>Ga door.</i>

35:53.240 --> 35:54.080
<i>Rood.</i>

35:55.000 --> 35:56.640
I've got something for you.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.920
<i>Jij moet gooien.</i>
<i>We zijn er bijna. Bijna.</i>

36:03.680 --> 36:05.400
This was Lucas' first little sock.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.720
I think he wore it only once
before he'd outgrown it.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.080
<i>Eva… Ja!</i>

36:14.560 --> 36:16.240
This is what you're doing it for.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.560
<i>U heeft een droomreis</i>
<i>gewonnen, naar Los Angeles en New York.</i>

36:20.240 --> 36:23.680
<i>En voor dit geweldige avontuur</i>
<i>krijgt u nog extra duizend gulden mee.</i>

36:25.040 --> 36:27.560
Merci.<i> Hartelijk dank.</i>
<i>En ik wens je een fijne...</i>

36:28.360 --> 36:31.640
<i>Zij gaan naar Los Angeles.</i>
<i>Pas op de champagne.</i>

36:33.240 --> 36:35.480
Welcome to

36:35.560 --> 36:42.400
the Teledutch Drive-In Show Extravaganza!

36:46.440 --> 36:50.760
This is how Ramon and I
first went into business together.

36:50.840 --> 36:51.720
I was 16.

36:51.800 --> 36:52.640
I was 14.

36:52.720 --> 36:55.960
Ramon was 14,
and with our own DJ drive-in set,

36:56.040 --> 36:57.840
we did the rounds at village fêtes.

36:57.920 --> 37:01.560
And especially for you guys tonight,
we've dusted off our old set

37:01.640 --> 37:07.400
and we'll play,
for one night only, no naughty sex tapes

37:07.480 --> 37:10.360
but bad records!

37:10.440 --> 37:11.600
Yeah!

37:12.960 --> 37:16.120
To salut the renewed Teledutch
with all of you.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.280
It may have been
a hundred grand more expensive.

37:20.880 --> 37:21.720
Yeah, very funny.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.080
But holy shit, Alexander,
it turned out so beautiful.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.160
You are a true artist.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.520
I would like to…

37:36.160 --> 37:39.520
I would like to thank a few more people,
of course. Without you guys--

37:39.600 --> 37:42.160
You would be a couple of broke fuckers!

37:42.800 --> 37:43.880
Johnny.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.920
Johnny, you had the guts to invest in us

37:47.000 --> 37:49.880
when no one else
could see what we were about. Thank you.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.280
Hey, Tsjibbe, where you at? Tsjibbe!

37:53.680 --> 37:54.560
Boom.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.720
And Ronnie, our amazing sound engineer.

37:57.800 --> 37:58.720
Thank you so much.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.600
He's single, gentlemen. Hey.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.040
-Not really funny. But whatever.
-Not really.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.600
Nina. The face of Teledutch.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.360
And last but not least,

38:12.000 --> 38:12.880
Ramon.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.600
Ramon!

38:15.680 --> 38:19.960
Brother, this adventure
is not my adventure, it's our adventure.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.840
I couldn't have done it without you.

38:25.040 --> 38:25.880
Thank you.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.600
Oh, wait. I'm totally forgetting someone.

38:35.880 --> 38:40.320
And that's all of you
working to record those dirty tapes.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.720
Give it up for DJ Ramon!

39:10.760 --> 39:12.640
Do you know how I know
that there is no God?

39:13.640 --> 39:15.400
By our genitals.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.520
Look, the perfect God, right?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.400
Who supposedly
created man in his own image,

39:20.480 --> 39:24.360
simply couldn't be responsible
for something like the ball sack.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.080
No? Not a funny joke?

39:28.920 --> 39:30.760
I'll soon be recording
for one of those lines

39:30.840 --> 39:33.000
and I thought I'd test it out, but…

39:33.080 --> 39:35.840
-I'm laughing on the inside.
-Oh, okay, right.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.520
Well, actually,
it's not even one of mine, it's--

39:38.600 --> 39:39.680
No, it's one of Nietzsche's.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.240
What have we got here?

39:41.920 --> 39:44.000
So you're not only pretty, but…

39:44.800 --> 39:46.280
He phrased it with less humor.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.920
Who'd have thought
that in this Sodom and Gomorrah,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.920
I'd meet a like-minded soul this evening.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Well.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.400
-Want to dance?
-Yeah.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.960
Frankie. Frank. Take one. Go on.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.200
Oh, party.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.760
-Cheers.
-Cheers, Johnny.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.000
Pretty lady.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.560
A bit young, maybe?

40:26.400 --> 40:28.120
So, I guess this is your choice.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.480
Do I have a choice?

40:31.640 --> 40:32.960
Anouk is pregnant, remember?

40:33.640 --> 40:34.920
She kicked me out, you know?

40:38.440 --> 40:40.760
There's a whole army of people
looking after her,

40:40.840 --> 40:43.680
including Ramon and me, 24/7.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.520
And you do nothing.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.480
Here.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.400
A small gift.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.000
You could put it on your dick
before you knock her up too.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.160
Hey, I've got to go.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.880
-We'll talk later.
-Bye.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.640
Are you happy with the new artwork?

41:20.240 --> 41:22.760
Absolutely.
It's just what the business needed.

41:22.840 --> 41:23.880
Thank you.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.120
That's great.

41:29.160 --> 41:31.480
Hey, I'm going home to relieve babysitter.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.760
Are you staying?

41:33.280 --> 41:34.320
-Yeah.
-Okay.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.480
-Sorry. I'm Natasja, Ramon's wife.
-Alexander.

41:37.560 --> 41:38.440
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.760
Alexander did the interior decorating.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.600
Wow, amazing work.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.480
Our house is in bad need of a makeover.
Maybe we can hire you.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.880
Yeah, sure.
It was a joy working with Ramon.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.880
Well, I don't make the decisions at home.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.440
-Why don't you go ahead? Yeah?
-Okay.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.720
-I'll take a cab home. Don't worry.
-Have fun then.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.240
It's really amazing, guys.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.640
She seems nice, man.

42:14.960 --> 42:15.800
Yeah.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.040
So, when's the RoXY opening up?
Maybe I could drop by sometime?

42:23.280 --> 42:25.760
-Don't bother.
-Don't bother?

42:25.840 --> 42:27.160
I…

42:28.480 --> 42:30.160
I really can't help you, Ramon.

42:30.760 --> 42:34.520
I know what it's like. I've been there.
And I think you're great, but…

42:35.280 --> 42:37.800
I don't feel
like going through that same hell again.

42:37.880 --> 42:38.960
So if you want to,

42:39.680 --> 42:40.840
then do it for you,

42:41.360 --> 42:42.960
not for me or anyone else.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.960
But do it.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.600
Otherwise it will tear you apart.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.320
<i>Sexual attraction</i>
<i>is a mysterious phenomenon.</i>

43:04.200 --> 43:06.640
<i>It goes far beyond a person's appearance.</i>

43:06.720 --> 43:09.280
<i>Was it matching pheromones?</i>

43:09.360 --> 43:10.760
<i>His scent?</i>

43:10.840 --> 43:15.280
<i>The fact that someone as famous as him</i>
<i>was the only one who took notice of me?</i>

43:15.360 --> 43:16.640
<i>Made me laugh?</i>

43:17.200 --> 43:19.280
<i>I'm sure I would have gone home with him.</i>

43:21.840 --> 43:25.800
<i>The problem with men is that</i>
<i>they notoriously say the wrong thing.</i>

43:26.680 --> 43:28.320
Feel like coming home with me tonight?

43:28.400 --> 43:30.080
<i>So far, so good.</i>

43:30.160 --> 43:32.120
I've never done it
with a Black woman before.

43:34.280 --> 43:37.280
No. Sorry. No.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.080
<i>Sorry?</i>

43:41.760 --> 43:43.040
<i>Why sorry?</i>

43:53.080 --> 43:55.320
Why do you want to have sex
a Black woman so badly?

43:58.040 --> 44:00.680
Is it different? Please enlighten me

44:00.760 --> 44:03.640
because I can't do special tricks
with my cunt, if that's what you think.

44:03.720 --> 44:06.600
And I know nothing
about unusual Surinamese positions,

44:06.680 --> 44:08.600
and I won't do any limbo dancing
on your cock.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.640
Are you still interested, Bram?

44:15.600 --> 44:18.800
Guys,
I completely forgot to thank Marly.

44:19.400 --> 44:21.160
Our own sexpert.

44:21.880 --> 44:23.880
Give it up for Marly!

44:25.960 --> 44:29.440
<i>My mother always said</i>
<i>every person has a role to play in life.</i>

44:30.640 --> 44:34.160
<i>But the challenge</i>
<i>is to discover what your role might be.</i>

44:34.240 --> 44:38.840
And this one is for Ronnie.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.640
<i> I'd become so good</i>
<i>at hiding who I was</i>

44:54.720 --> 44:57.720
<i>that I thought I was a mere extra</i>
<i>in the lives of others.</i>

45:06.760 --> 45:10.080
<i>And that all changed</i>
<i>the moment I dared being loud again.</i>

45:16.960 --> 45:18.760
<i>Extremely loud.</i>

45:55.240 --> 45:57.680
MEN ONLY

46:14.680 --> 46:18.800
<i>…without seeing you,</i>
<i>I can feel your hands on my body.</i>

46:19.440 --> 46:22.120
<i>I rake my nails down your back.</i>

46:22.200 --> 46:23.680
<i>I pull you close.</i>

46:24.200 --> 46:29.480
<i>I place my hand on your pants</i>
<i>and feel your cock slowly go hard.</i>

46:52.040 --> 46:54.000
<i>This is Anouk's answering machine.</i>

46:54.080 --> 46:54.920
<i>And Frank's.</i>

46:55.000 --> 46:58.200
<i>And Frank's too.</i>
<i>Please leave your message after the…</i>

46:58.280 --> 46:59.200
<i> Beep.</i>

47:00.560 --> 47:01.400
Hey, Poekie.

47:03.960 --> 47:04.840
It's me.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.200
<i>Frank?</i>

47:09.080 --> 47:10.560
<i>Please come home.</i>

49:38.480 --> 49:40.000
<i>Yes!</i>

49:40.080 --> 49:41.440
<i>There!</i>

49:41.520 --> 49:43.520
<i>Oh, go on!</i>

49:43.600 --> 49:46.520
<i>Oh, I love it.</i>

49:46.600 --> 49:49.000
<i>Come on.</i>

49:49.080 --> 49:50.400
<i>Go on.</i>

49:50.480 --> 49:51.680
<i>Deeper!</i>

49:51.760 --> 49:52.800
<i>Harder!</i>

49:52.880 --> 49:53.760
<i>Go on!</i>

49:54.440 --> 49:56.480
<i>Yes!</i>

49:58.160 --> 50:00.520
<i>Yeah!</i>
