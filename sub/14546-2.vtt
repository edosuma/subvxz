I could convince you to be Ken.

Nope. As it turns out,
there was no thingy at all.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.370
[instrumental music]

19:23.412 --> 19:25.038
Where's everybody going?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.291
It's over, Wolfe. It's over.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.876
I was gonna bludgeon her.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.586
I know you were.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.088
[knocking on window]

19:35.883 --> 19:37.843
[instrumental music]

19:42.723 --> 19:44.057
Hmm.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.350
Machine washable.

19:57.487 --> 19:58.906
Man.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.991
I thought I suffered
taking the hair off.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.076
It's way worse coming back in.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.246
Well, now you know
what a woman goes through.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.831
Wax it off and suffer the itches

20:07.873 --> 20:09.958
or grow it out and..

20:10.000 --> 20:13.170
...suffer the bitches.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.630
The what?

20:14.671 --> 20:16.423
The women who judge you
for being unconventional.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.008
Oh.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.469
It takes a lot of guts
to be a feminist in this town.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.221
Hey, you don't have to tell me,
I consider myself

20:22.262 --> 20:24.056
a male feminist, and I got

20:24.097 --> 20:26.558
the Mary Chapin Carpenter
records to prove it.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.227
Hey, you know who else
was probably a feminist?

20:28.268 --> 20:31.855
- Hmm?
- Alex, right? My mom?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.232
I mean, think about it.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.608
To walk away from the role

20:34.650 --> 20:36.526
that was thrust upon her.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.487
O-okay, no-nobody thrusted.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.030
She must have known
that she was gonna get judged

20:40.072 --> 20:42.699
pretty harshly for doing it.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.285
In a way..

20:45.327 --> 20:48.121
...it was kind of brave.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.415
Mm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.628
Hey, man. What's up?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.713
Hey.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.299
I was gonna donate these plaid
shirts I bought to Goodwill.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.176
Then I thought
I'd drive over here

21:01.218 --> 21:04.054
see if you wanted 'em first,
for free.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.889
Thanks. They're so me.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.057
Wassup, red?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.392
'Look..'

21:08.433 --> 21:10.185
...I'm sorry
if I got a little carried away

21:10.227 --> 21:11.645
with my George impersonation.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.105
'And I know that Jill
wasn't excited'

21:13.146 --> 21:14.564
when I went as her last year.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.566
Although, I gotta say,
I had her down.

21:18.193 --> 21:19.528
Stop touching me.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.197
Get your hands off of me.
That hurts.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.365
[both laughing]

21:23.407 --> 21:25.909
Solid Jill.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.619
[laughing]
