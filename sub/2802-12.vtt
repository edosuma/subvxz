00:02.044 --> 00:04.129
Coming here always reminds me
I should travel more.

00:04.213 --> 00:05.923
I tried to get you to go to France.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.091
-No. You fled to France.
-Nitpicking.

00:08.175 --> 00:12.179
You had quite a run there for a while.
Riviera, Copenhagen.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.722
I should've sent postcards.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.433
No, I had Interpol warrants. Just as good.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.519
"Neal's robbing a palace.
Wish you were here."

00:18.602 --> 00:20.145
Good times.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.731
Where would you go? Anywhere in the world.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.067
Sweden. I like Vikings.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.444
Sword in my hand, good ship under my feet.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.029
Pillage and plunder.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.740
I knew under that lawman exterior
beats the heart of a thief.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.076
Well, maybe I just like hats with horns.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.957
That's our guy.
Undersecretary of Asian Affairs.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.709
-He asked for us?
-Yep.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.379
What does the State Department
want with the FBI?

00:45.462 --> 00:46.505
Let's ask him.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.927
Agent Burke? Adam Wilson.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.472
And you must be Neal Caffrey.
Thanks for coming.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.183
It's not often I get a request
from the UN ambassador's office.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.810
How can we help?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.187
His name is Christopher Harlowe.

01:02.271 --> 01:06.441
He's, uh, an American college student
being held in Kabaw Prison in Burma.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.235
Why?

01:08.318 --> 01:11.071
He's accused of smuggling
a ruby out of the country.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.866
(WHISTLES) Gem smuggling in Burma,
that's serious.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.742
We believe the charges are trumped up.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.911
You think they grabbed him
to embarrass the US?

01:17.995 --> 01:19.246
It's possible.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.540
Our relations with Burma aren't good.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.750
We're in the middle of trade negotiations
that aren't moving.

01:23.834 --> 01:28.172
This is a kid with no criminal record,
no prior travel or contacts in the region.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.133
I sympathize with your problem,
but where do we come in?

01:31.216 --> 01:36.096
We've heard chatter that the ruby
was smuggled out of Burma by someone else

01:36.180 --> 01:38.098
and that it's here in Manhattan.

01:38.182 --> 01:41.518
We find the real smuggler
the case against Christopher falls apart.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.603
Exactly.

01:42.686 --> 01:43.896
Can you help?

01:47.232 --> 01:50.569
Christopher Harlowe is charged
with stealing this.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.987
The Mandalay Ruby.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.698
It's a 237-carat pigeon blood.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.991
Pigeon blood?

01:56.074 --> 01:58.285
It's a local description
of a deep red color

01:58.368 --> 02:00.120
of the most prized Burmese gems.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.122
No pigeons were harmed
in the mining of this ruby.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.667
-JONES: Mmm. I'll take mine medium rare.
-That's good to know.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.545
In the last year,
it was held in a secured vault

02:08.629 --> 02:11.548
at a state mining facility
under army guard

02:11.632 --> 02:12.841
in the middle of a jungle.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.510
Not exactly a prime location

02:14.593 --> 02:17.012
for a college kid
to just walk in and grab it.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.890
No. The mine is in the Mogok Valley.
You can get there by a helicopter

02:19.973 --> 02:22.601
or a seven-hour Jeep ride
over some nasty terrain.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.102
You just know these things.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.687
-Yeah, that's why they keep me around.
-Mmm.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.732
You'd need some muscle, a cargo plane,
and a few grand in bribe money

02:28.815 --> 02:30.567
-just to get started.
-You would?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.653
And who knows what else

02:32.736 --> 02:35.405
because I have never considered
stealing gems in Burma.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.285
-Wow.
-What if this kid's guilty?

02:40.369 --> 02:42.496
We're working
under the assumption he's not.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.206
If we find the thief in Manhattan

02:44.289 --> 02:47.209
then the Burmese case
against Christopher falls apart.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.963
So Diana, Jones,
see if any of our usual gem fences

02:51.046 --> 02:52.631
-have been in Burma lately.
-Got it.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.715
Neal.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.217
Sniff around my contacts

02:55.300 --> 02:58.053
and see if anybody's hawking
a 237-carat pigeon blood.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.013
That's why I keep you around.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.895
You know,
you look at the world differently

03:06.979 --> 03:09.565
when you've crossed the Irrawaddy River
on the shoulders of an elephant.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.483
-You've been to Burma?
-Myanmar.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.277
Ooh, guess I missed that postcard.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.654
Thank you for referring to our country
by its true name.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.738
Of course.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.241
We changed our name to Myanmar in 1989.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.535
After a military junta took over. I know.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.329
But America still recognizes it as Burma.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.291
One of the many reasons we find
negotiating with your country difficult.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.168
This is Ambassador Tan Kyi.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.963
Gentlemen. I'm sorry we couldn't
meet under better circumstances.

03:33.046 --> 03:37.676
Special Agent Burke, FBI,
and this is my consultant, Neal Caffrey.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.344
Mr. Caffrey.

03:39.428 --> 03:43.432
You understand that my government is under
no obligation to turn over the DVD

03:43.515 --> 03:47.060
of Christopher Harlowe's confession
as this is purely an internal matter.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.688
I'm sure pressure
from Amnesty International

03:49.771 --> 03:52.024
to confirm the health and well-being
of Christopher Harlowe

03:52.107 --> 03:53.567
had nothing to do with it either.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.321
The DVD will verify
that he's being well treated.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.489
But also that he's guilty of the theft.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.949
Sadly, yes.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.869
Ambassador Kyi, if we prove
that someone else stole the ruby,

04:03.952 --> 04:05.954
I assume you would release Christopher.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.540
Well, of course I would bring
that evidence to our courts.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.418
I believe the Myanmar people
have a saying.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.504
"Even if the truth
is buried for centuries,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.172
"it will eventually come out and thrive."

04:16.131 --> 04:19.718
Yes. But keep in mind that
he will be sentenced in one week.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.638
After that, it would be very difficult
to reverse the decision

04:22.721 --> 04:24.765
despite our proverbs.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.684
Thank you, Ambassador.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.102
Quite welcome.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.902
Thank you, gentlemen.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.531
Yeah. Maybe we'll meet again
under less political circumstances.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.657
That would be nice.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.621
PETER: Love that you had
that Burmese proverb ready to go.

04:47.704 --> 04:51.041
Mmm. They also say
beware a man's shadow and a bee's sting.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.085
What does that mean?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.419
I have no idea.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.088
-Then you used the right one.
-Yeah.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.259
NEAL: Did he just trash a parking ticket?

05:00.342 --> 05:02.427
Yeah. Just like
it was a bubblegum wrapper.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.554
(SCOFFS)

05:03.637 --> 05:05.681
Diplomatic immunity.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.600
-Bane of meter maids everywhere.
-Yeah.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.019
This case is gonna be different
than we're used to.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.479
Our laws don't apply.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.231
I hope Chris can hold out the week.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.943
For whatever reason,
they wanna make an example out of him.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.903
Once he's sentenced by the junta,

05:19.987 --> 05:22.239
no civilian court
will overturn his verdict.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.325
We have one week to prove he didn't do it.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.497
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:43.010 --> 05:45.012
I don't know how you pulled it off.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.306
The Burmese have been stonewalling
since Chris's arrest.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.183
We weren't even aware there was a tape.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.810
Well, you can thank
Agent Berrigan for this.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.563
The Regional director
of Southeast Asia is a friend.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.232
She was able to pressure them
into turning over proof of life.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.775
The good thing about this is,

05:58.859 --> 06:00.903
they wouldn't let us see it
unless he was all right.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.237
Go ahead.

It's gonna be hard to refute.

When you came to us,
you already knew that he had confessed.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.247
Yeah, sorry. I should've mentioned that.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.583
But Chris has absolutely
no criminal record whatsoever.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.418
Chris?

06:58.502 --> 07:02.047
We're meeting outside your workplace,
you're comfortable calling him Chris.

07:02.130 --> 07:05.133
-Chris isn't just any kid, is he?
-He's your son.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.594

07:09.221 --> 07:10.222
Yeah.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.811
Chris and I have become… distant.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.647
He took his mother's name
after the divorce.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.900
Our contact is down to e-mails
at birthdays and holidays.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.987
But if the Burmese
are made aware that he is my son…

07:25.070 --> 07:26.738
You don't want him used
as a bargaining chip.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.783
We may not be close,
but I'm still his father.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.451
I can't put him in jeopardy.

07:31.535 --> 07:32.911
We'll handle this.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.038
He was doing something with his hand.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.999
Do you think he was sending a signal?

07:37.082 --> 07:40.294
The children of diplomats are trained
to send messages if they're in trouble.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.504
We're gonna need to get a look
at the rest of that tape.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.300
What kind of father is that?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.594
His job puts Chris at further risk.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.847
So he came to us sub rosa
instead to protect him.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.183
-Tough love?
-It's what my father would've done.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.393
Your dad was a bricklayer, not a diplomat.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.020
Okay, so he would've tried
to break through

07:58.103 --> 08:00.314
the mortar walls
of the prison first instead.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.733
But he would've done the same thing.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.067
What about yours?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.527
-My dad?
-Yeah.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.945
I don't know much about him.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.072
Oh, I thought you knew
everything about me.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.783
There's a big gaping hole
before your 18th birthday.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.702
-Enjoy the mystery.
-Oh, come on.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.038
-You don't wanna talk about him?
-What do you want me to say?

08:16.121 --> 08:18.749
I don't know. Start small.
What did he do for a living?

08:19.374 --> 08:20.834
My dad was a cop.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.087
A cop?

08:24.171 --> 08:27.049
You said start small. Have a nice day.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.510
-You get…
-No.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.928
-Come on. A cop?
-No.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.975
You know, I'd appreciate it
if you'd replenish my supply

08:37.059 --> 08:39.478
-when you diminish it.
-I'm wallowing.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.981
Word on the street is
you went to Randy Morosco for information.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.610
Well, a unique black-market pigeon blood
recently made its way to New York,

08:46.693 --> 08:48.529
and none of the local shops
have anything like it.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.906
No one would try to sell a stone like that
without cutting it first.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.824
It calls too much attention to itself.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.826
One would think that's why Randy Morosco

08:54.910 --> 08:56.286
is the kind of guy
that could help me find it.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.829
I'm a gem expert.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.791
That's true. And you asked to
keep your distance from the FBI.

09:00.874 --> 09:01.875
I was doing you a favor.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.795
Oh. By conversing with my archrival?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.713
Everyone's your archrival, Mozz.

09:09.591 --> 09:13.178
But I would like the chance
at first veto on helping.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.222
I will come to you first next time.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.894
-Hey, Mozz.
-Yeah?

09:20.978 --> 09:23.146
Were you ever curious
about your birth parents?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.065
(SCOFFS) No, thanks.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.861
I don't need to look into the crystal ball
of my future.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.779
You heading down that road again?

09:30.863 --> 09:34.575
No. I was talking with Peter today
and my father came up.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.995
You wanna lie down on the couch?
I'll get my notepad.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.997
No, thanks, Dr. Freud.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.332
I just find it fascinating

09:42.416 --> 09:45.169
considering your patriarchal relationship
with the suit

09:45.252 --> 09:47.504
and your penchant for breaking the law.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.298
Does Peter know?

09:49.381 --> 09:50.674
I said he was a cop.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.718
Ah.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.927
You gonna tell him?

09:55.179 --> 09:57.764
-You know, he could be useful.
-Mozz.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.810
So Randy and the ruby.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.520
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

10:03.604 --> 10:05.731
Before I went to prison.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.150
-You think he's gonna talk to you?
-Of course.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.236
Provided I'm the guy he remembers.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.491
VENDOR: Don't you want the frame?

10:16.575 --> 10:17.826
NEAL: No, thanks.

10:19.578 --> 10:22.039
-What's with the glasses?
-Just…

10:22.122 --> 10:25.334
-Easier to examine the gems with.
-You have 20/20 vision.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.713
Randy's having a trunk show
at his store in a few days.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.049
They show their latest wares
to a select group of buyers.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.468
-I know what a trunk show is.
-Oh, excuse me.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.095
He plays in the gray side
of the valuable stones market.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.723
It's not about the uniqueness of the cut,
but the story behind it.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.892
More memorable the tale,
the more people will pay.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.102
Like getting smuggled
out of a Burmese fortress?

10:44.186 --> 10:46.480
Now you're proving my point.
Let me do the talking.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.149
Or I can get a search warrant
to find the damn ruby.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.859
Chris doesn't have time to spare.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.028
Which is exactly why we're not
waiting around for a warrant.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.780
If the ruby's in there, I'll find out.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.116
-Why does your way beat my way?
-Because a friend of mine knows Randy.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.826
Don't let his rough exterior fool you.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.371
The man can slice a gem
like Marcel Tolkowsky himself.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.541
Oh, well, Marcel Tolkowsky.
Why didn't you tell me?

11:09.711 --> 11:12.172
Mr. Donnelly, what a surprise.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.551
-You said friend, not alias.
-I consider them my friends.

11:15.634 --> 11:16.802
Randy.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.179
-Always a pleasure.
-How's the family?

11:19.263 --> 11:21.390
Oh, you're opening Pandora's Box.

11:21.473 --> 11:25.644
Nancy recently made partner at the firm
and Dillon, he's obsessed with soccer.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.855
Beautiful. Love the new haircut.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.898
And your boy, I barely recognize him.

11:29.982 --> 11:32.651
Time flies.
Listen, we're in a bit of a rush, Randy.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.863
This is Nancy's brother, Mr. Satchmo.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.156
He reminded me
that Nancy's birthday is coming up.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.909
Yes. I'm here to confirm

11:40.993 --> 11:43.453
he makes up
for totally forgetting it last year.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.331
I heard you designed a piece
that could do the trick.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.250
The, uh, rarer, the better.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.252
I might have a few new things.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.920
You ready, Mr. Donnelly?

11:52.004 --> 11:53.755
(CHUCKLES)

11:53.839 --> 11:55.090
Mr. Satchmo?

11:55.174 --> 11:56.592
Oh, yeah.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.308
(SAFE DIAL TURNING)

12:08.020 --> 12:12.232
These are some of my finest pieces.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.195
Here. There.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.738
NEAL: Wow.
RANDY: Mmm-hmm.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.867
I think this could be the one.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.452
You have a good eye, Mr. Donnelly.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.954
Two hundred carats, S1 quality.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.539
May I see the provenance?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.251
-Paperwork is boring.
-Oh.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.545
Did you know that this necklace

12:33.629 --> 12:38.425
was part of the maharajah's collection
from 1805 to 1954?

12:38.509 --> 12:41.094
PETER: Mmm-hmm.
RANDY: You see the dents on the side?

12:41.178 --> 12:43.222
Oh, an imperfection. Shame.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.765
<i>Au contraire.</i>

12:44.848 --> 12:47.684
When the maharajah's wife
found him sleeping with a servant girl

12:47.768 --> 12:50.354
she threw it against a wall.
Intriguing. Yes?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.480
PETER: Mmm.

12:51.563 --> 12:54.066
RANDY: The servant girl
grabbed the necklace and ran.

12:54.149 --> 12:58.195
Now, though she was penniless,
she refused to sell it

12:58.278 --> 13:01.240
because its beauty was more
important to her than wealth.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.158
No other gem in the world has its history.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.786
Hence, the augmented price.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.580
Fascinating. Would you excuse us a moment?

13:08.664 --> 13:10.582
-Mmm-hmm.
-NEAL: Great story.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.132
This provenance is fake.

13:19.216 --> 13:22.177
The setting is period, but the stone
was recently cut and polished

13:22.261 --> 13:25.097
using technology
that didn't exist 150 years ago.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.849
This necklace is our pigeon blood.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.268
Two hundred carats, S1, it's gotta be.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.394
I got this.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.524
It's quite an imperfection, Randy.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.818
I'm sure Nancy would appreciate the story.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.153
He was talking about your paperwork.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.198
FBI. You're selling stolen merchandise.

13:43.282 --> 13:44.366
George, what is this?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.451
Peter, you just burned
a perfectly good alias.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.871
-And you named me after my dog.
-Touché.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.790
You're gonna tell me another story, Randy.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.168
The one about the person
who sold you this ruby.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.843
Randy claims he doesn't know
the real name of the man

14:02.926 --> 14:03.969
who sold him the piece.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.346
-He give a description?
-Not one that will ID him.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.514
British accent.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.559
This stone was the first time
Randy did business with this guy.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.478
Yeah, he said he'd bring back more,
but we can't afford to wait.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.355
So we make him come to us.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.526
We'll use his trunk show
to host a viewing of exquisite gems.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.528
We'll invite the who's who
of the jewelry world.

14:21.612 --> 14:24.615
With the hope our ruby smuggler
won't be able to resist stopping by

14:24.698 --> 14:25.866
to check out the competition.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.077
But when he does, we take him in,
get him to confess, clear Chris.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.370
Mmm-hmm.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.832
It sounds good on paper. One problem.
These people know Randy's inventory.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.250
If we're gonna pull this off,
we need to…

14:35.334 --> 14:36.668
Show them the old razzle-dazzle?

14:36.752 --> 14:39.630
With flawless gems, not jazz hands.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.842
I was hoping I'd never
have to share this with you.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.512
The FBI has a gem vault
and you didn't tell me?

14:46.595 --> 14:48.305
Why give an alcoholic a drink?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.432
JONES: They're waiting for us
in the conference room.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.100
How many jewels do I get to take?

14:52.184 --> 14:53.227
-Take?
-Use.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.771
-For this particular mission.
-Plenty.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.941
When the Bureau comes across
black-market gems, we confiscate them.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.402
Thanks.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.031
And they accumulate
in an evidence locker gathering dust.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.077
NEAL: That's it?

15:10.160 --> 15:12.329
-JONES: These are the best we've got.
-Are you serious?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.004
These are nice.

15:21.088 --> 15:25.384
Nice? You could buy a SoHo loft with
one of these and still get change back.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.344
-Well, they'll help.
-But?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.888
But none of these are pigeon bloods.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.390
We need something that threatens

15:31.473 --> 15:33.725
our smuggler's corner on the market
if we're gonna draw him out.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.728
I don't think the FBI will authorize us
taking a trip to Burma.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.063
Right.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.899
So I'll need an oven that reaches
2,000 degrees Celsius

15:40.983 --> 15:42.484
and some welding equipment.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.626
Perhaps assisting the suit isn't so bad.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.170
Impressive tools.

in the silk veins.

flame-fusion apparatus.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.326
You're making that up.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.828
We're making synthetic rubies, plebian.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.246
It's plebeian.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.125
How long till it's cooked?

16:40.209 --> 16:41.585
About six hours.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.587
We're halfway there.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.422
Will this fool our Brit?

16:45.506 --> 16:48.342
Verneuils have curved growth lines
natural crystals run parallel,

16:48.425 --> 16:50.594
but it requires high magnification…

16:50.677 --> 16:53.305
-Close enough for government work.
-That's what I wanna hear.

the equipment, didn't you?

Yeah. It's perfect.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.523
Perfect. It's good, right?

17:44.606 --> 17:46.316
Not quite.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.694
You see, perfection
is the antithesis of authenticity.

17:50.654 --> 17:54.283
Real gems have flaws. Now ours has one.

17:54.366 --> 17:57.911
Great. All right, I talked to Randy.
The show is set for tomorrow night.

17:57.995 --> 18:00.789
Unless they're looking at it
under a microscope, you'll be fine.

I think I have a fix for that.

Mr. Satchmo.

in so many ways.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.508
I discovered it last month at a castle
in the Scottish Highlands.

In a rock collection, of all places.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.681
Scottish rock collection.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.060
Well, the maharajah bit was good too.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.063

for such a high-profile gem.

But I don't discuss business
in a public setting.

Good. Be ready.

There you are.

no one saw us leave together.

-We're good.
-Good.

You think I can't find out
your sources by myself?

20:55.756 --> 20:57.382
I guess you do like working alone.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.802
Personally, I like to work with a team.

And another one.

Now it's attempted murder of an FBI agent.

was quite impressive.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.252
Well, thank you.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.588
In my field, it's rare
to be recognized for your work.

21:36.672 --> 21:41.051
And this statement
covers the entire theft?

21:41.134 --> 21:43.220
I didn't leave out a detail,

21:43.303 --> 21:45.013
-per our agreement.
-Hmm.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.558
Have you ever seen this kid?

21:48.475 --> 21:50.519
-Nope.
-Are you sure?

21:50.602 --> 21:52.271
I prefer to work alone.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.068
Chris will be fine.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.737
The ambassador promised to call
as soon as Collins' statement

22:00.821 --> 22:03.282
to the Burmese authorities has been taken.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.491
Then Chris is released.

22:04.575 --> 22:06.660
I won't believe anything
until he's free and home.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.705
When was the last time you saw your son?

22:09.788 --> 22:11.623
Eight years ago.

22:11.707 --> 22:14.751
I'm sure it must be pretty difficult
with your position.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.962
My divorce was messy.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.840
I tried to remain close with Chris,

22:19.923 --> 22:22.384
but he ended up resenting
everything I stand for.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.428
And ultimately,

22:24.511 --> 22:26.346
he said he didn't need me.

22:26.430 --> 22:29.349
A 12-year-old doesn't know
what he does or doesn't need.

22:30.642 --> 22:33.145
He didn't wanna be my son,
there was nothing I could do.

22:33.562 --> 22:37.608
Yeah. Well, you're his father,
you should've kept trying.

22:37.691 --> 22:38.942
I realize that.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.655
That's why I'm here now.

22:45.449 --> 22:47.993
The ambassador's aide just called.
They wanna see you.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.251
Mmm-hmm. Absolutely. That's him.

22:56.335 --> 22:58.128
That's the guy
who helped me with the ruby theft.

22:58.212 --> 23:00.005
I showed you this photo.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.007
You said you'd never seen him.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.218
Well, I didn't recognize him at first.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.720
When we met, he, uh, had a beard.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.805
KYI: It was fortunate
that I could spend a few moments

23:08.889 --> 23:11.266
with Mr. Collins
in order to confirm details.

23:11.350 --> 23:14.144
Obviously, there were omissions.

23:14.228 --> 23:18.065
Fine. Then give Collins back to me,
and I'll get him for attempted murder.

23:18.148 --> 23:21.151
No, I'm sorry.
But now that he's on Burmese soil

23:21.235 --> 23:23.320
we need to extradite him
for his part in the theft.

23:23.403 --> 23:27.115
So he gets to go home
while an innocent American stays in jail.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.076
We made a deal.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.288
Looks like he made a better one.

23:34.957 --> 23:36.250
This isn't over.

23:42.089 --> 23:45.801
The Burmese government
gave Collins political asylum.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.428
I'm hoping that the tape
will tell us something.

23:49.179 --> 23:52.641
-Uh-oh. He's got his crossword.
-Helps me think.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.518

23:54.601 --> 23:57.646
-I'm surprised you can't do it.
-I like to hone in, focus.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.357
Yeah. Where do you think
that trick comes from?

24:00.440 --> 24:03.235
Nice try. I don't wanna talk about my dad.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.945
-Fine.
-Do your crossword.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.071

-Let me see that.
-No.

24:19.918 --> 24:21.670
-You made that up.
-So sue me.

24:21.753 --> 24:26.550
For four years, I studied your every move
and not one word about your father.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.469
And all of a sudden you drop a bomb on me
that he's a cop.

24:29.553 --> 24:30.846
Fine.

24:31.847 --> 24:33.849
I'll tell you everything my mom told me.

24:33.932 --> 24:34.933
Good.

24:36.185 --> 24:38.145
I didn't know him.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.646
He died when I was two.

24:39.730 --> 24:42.566
-Aw, Neal, I'm sorry.
-Please.

24:42.649 --> 24:46.361
Mom said he went out in a hail of gunfire
taking down a whole gang of bad guys.

24:46.445 --> 24:47.738
He was a hero.

24:48.614 --> 24:50.657
I grew up wanting to be just like him.

24:50.741 --> 24:54.953
Other kids played cowboys and Indians,
I pretended I was my dad.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.707

25:01.460 --> 25:02.461

might try to send a message.

25:32.074 --> 25:33.992

-I thought her name was Rocker.
-It's her nickname.

26:21.915 --> 26:25.085
Using a nickname was smart.
Makes it harder for the Burmese to decode.

-It has its perks.

Does Wilson have
any other connection to the Bureau?

-What are you getting at?
-Something's been bugging me

32:06.760 --> 32:09.763
since the beginning.
Why did Wilson choose us?

32:10.931 --> 32:13.392
Because you're the best and Caffrey's…

Wilson wanted to work outside the box.

off reservation to save his son.

32:23.569 --> 32:26.530

Wilson wanted Neal from the beginning.

for the last 36 hours.

32:29.867 --> 32:33.328

Let's walk through this, Liz Taylor.

departs New York tomorrow

32:44.464 --> 32:47.092

to Burma.

is a Miss Suu Ram.

Ah, she's transporting
the pouch personally.

32:55.225 --> 32:59.605
The ambassador's limousine will drive her
directly from the consulate to the plane.

32:59.688 --> 33:03.400
Which only leaves us a few moments
between the consulate and the limo

33:03.483 --> 33:05.110
to acquire its contents.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.238
Is that a cat?

33:08.322 --> 33:11.408
No. It's the pouch with the Burmese crest.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.368
A cogwheel and a rice plant.

33:13.785 --> 33:15.829
-Looks like a cat.
-It's not.

33:15.913 --> 33:20.959
Anything in the pouch
is the property of Burma, stolen or not.

33:21.043 --> 33:24.213
You remove the drive,
you're creating an international incident.

33:24.296 --> 33:27.799
So I get Suu Ram to do it for me
using our ruby.

33:27.883 --> 33:29.718
To take my heart would be less painful.

33:29.801 --> 33:32.346
We can always make another one.

33:32.429 --> 33:35.057
I say it's the Mandalay
just back from evidence,

33:35.140 --> 33:36.141
give her a quick look

33:36.225 --> 33:39.436
close the lid on the box,
and she places it in the pouch.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.730
Unbeknownst to her, the box also contains

33:41.813 --> 33:44.566
a finite amount of ammonia
and hydrochloric acid.

33:44.650 --> 33:48.278
Moments after the clasp
on the box is closed

33:48.362 --> 33:50.489
the liquids mix and…

33:51.615 --> 33:52.658
And…

33:55.536 --> 33:57.663
Shouldn't a smoke bomb make smoke?

33:58.664 --> 33:59.873
Patience.

33:59.957 --> 34:03.252
In theory, Suu Ram spots smoke
coming from the pouch

34:03.335 --> 34:05.295
dumps the contents onto American soil

34:05.379 --> 34:07.798
and I reclaim the external drive
as stolen evidence.

34:07.881 --> 34:10.133
Thus, proving our brilliance.

34:10.217 --> 34:11.844
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:23.063 --> 34:26.733
-Peter. Hey.
-Neal. Mozzie.

34:29.194 --> 34:30.320
What you doing?

34:30.946 --> 34:33.574
Discussing Hegel
and his rational realism. You?

34:35.117 --> 34:36.785
Casual stroll.

34:36.869 --> 34:37.870
You're smoking.

34:39.037 --> 34:40.497
It's a smoking jacket.

34:42.124 --> 34:43.292
Give us a moment?

34:43.375 --> 34:45.210
I will.

34:45.294 --> 34:48.881
Because the fresh air sounds exhilarating.

34:54.303 --> 34:55.846
You met with Wilson yesterday.

34:56.346 --> 34:58.348
Neal, whatever he's asking you to do…

34:58.432 --> 35:01.602
-He's got nowhere else to turn.
-Oh, God, Neal, don't do it.

35:01.685 --> 35:04.479
Look, Wilson's trying to make good
with his son and I can help him.

35:04.563 --> 35:05.814
The system failed him.

35:05.898 --> 35:07.983
You're rationalizing and you know it.

35:08.066 --> 35:11.570
Nothing gives him or you or anyone
the right to go around the law.

35:11.653 --> 35:14.156
It's his son. That gives him the right.

35:14.239 --> 35:15.324
I don't agree with that.

35:15.824 --> 35:17.075
It's what a father should do.

35:19.453 --> 35:21.288
All right, look.

35:21.371 --> 35:23.707
Obviously, there's more to the story
with your dad.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.251
I don't know how badly
it messed with your head…

35:26.335 --> 35:28.253
You're right, you don't.

35:30.506 --> 35:33.675
If this were your son or my son,

35:34.885 --> 35:36.220
I know what you would do.

35:36.303 --> 35:37.346
(SCOFFS)

35:38.514 --> 35:42.017
One wrong move
inside the Burmese consulate

35:42.100 --> 35:43.352
and they will extradite you.

35:44.228 --> 35:46.355
You'll end up in a Kabaw prison.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.565
I can't protect you.

35:48.649 --> 35:49.942
I'm not asking you to.

35:50.901 --> 35:52.110
Okay.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.829
So we good to go?

36:05.666 --> 36:06.875
Yeah.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.109
-Mr. Caffrey.
-NEAL: Hello.

36:32.192 --> 36:33.902
Come to search my person again?

36:33.986 --> 36:37.281
No. I came to return something
you've been waiting for.

36:39.575 --> 36:42.369
-The ruby.
-As promised.

36:42.452 --> 36:45.247
Excuse me.
I must show this to the ambassador.

36:46.665 --> 36:47.666
Of course.

36:53.255 --> 36:54.548
-Boss!
-What?

36:54.631 --> 36:56.633
I'm glad I caught you.
I got Neal's tracking data.

36:56.717 --> 36:59.303
-He's at the Burmese mission.
-Ah. I knew it.

36:59.386 --> 37:00.929
He's going after the drive, isn't he?

37:01.013 --> 37:05.184
It contains information the Burmese
consider too sensitive to e-mail.

37:05.267 --> 37:08.061
They'll go to extreme measures
to protect it. I warned him!

37:08.145 --> 37:09.396
Yeah, but you didn't stop him.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.273
What do you mean?

37:11.356 --> 37:14.318
Boss, you could've chained him to the desk
if you wanted to, but you didn't.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.403
You saying I want him to get that drive?

37:16.486 --> 37:18.071
I'm saying that you know
Christopher's innocent

37:18.155 --> 37:19.740
and you're not exactly fond of diplomats.

37:22.284 --> 37:23.827
I don't want Neal to get caught.

37:23.911 --> 37:25.287
Well, you know where he is.

37:26.330 --> 37:29.124
Have your diplomatic friends
on speed dial.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.209
If this goes wrong,

37:30.292 --> 37:33.045
Neal and I are gonna start
an international incident.

37:42.679 --> 37:44.306
Mr. Caffrey, you're still here.

37:44.389 --> 37:47.142
Yeah. I wanted to make sure
the ruby makes it home safely.

37:48.101 --> 37:49.728
I assure you that it will.

37:49.811 --> 37:52.773
Myanmar is thrilled
to have its property back at home.

37:52.856 --> 37:53.899
I'm sure you are.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.360
If you'll excuse us…

38:08.539 --> 38:10.332
-PETER: Neal.
-Peter.

38:10.415 --> 38:13.877
-Look, I know I got…
-I know. What do you need me for?

38:13.961 --> 38:16.922
-You're not here to stop me?
-Savor this moment.

38:17.005 --> 38:18.507
I'm already savoring.

38:18.590 --> 38:19.716
Look, I'll spare you the details,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.510
but basically,
the smoking jacket's not smoking.

38:21.593 --> 38:22.928
We need to stall.

38:28.016 --> 38:30.561
KYI: …to anyone else,
do not open this pouch.

38:30.644 --> 38:34.481
Guard it with your life
because it has everything that we need.

38:34.565 --> 38:36.483
Mr. Ambassador.

38:36.567 --> 38:37.985
Beautiful day, isn't it?

38:39.152 --> 38:40.362
Agent Burke.

38:41.572 --> 38:44.199
I trust you and your companion
aren't here interfering

38:44.283 --> 38:45.826
with the official business of Myanmar.

38:45.909 --> 38:47.119
Wouldn't think of it.

38:47.202 --> 38:50.622
Just happened to notice you're parked
near a hydrant with a ticket.

38:50.706 --> 38:53.500
This car is registered to the mission.

38:53.584 --> 38:55.002
We don't pay for parking tickets.

38:55.085 --> 38:57.421
And your car's registration
can prove that?

38:58.422 --> 38:59.673
Hold this, please.

39:06.305 --> 39:09.641
The registration and 18 parking tickets.

39:09.725 --> 39:10.934
All unpaid?

39:11.018 --> 39:12.936
-Diplomatic immun…
-Immunity. Yeah.

39:13.020 --> 39:16.190
Means that you can't be held accountable
for these violations.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.817
You are, however,

39:18.901 --> 39:21.737
required to help me close out
my investigation

39:21.820 --> 39:23.614
of said parking violations.

39:24.573 --> 39:25.782
Let's get started.

39:27.326 --> 39:30.579
November 8th, what's your reason
for not paying this one?

39:30.662 --> 39:31.997
Diplomatic immunity.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.165
Right.

39:34.374 --> 39:36.460
Uh, here's one for…

39:36.543 --> 39:38.837
Oh, I can't read that.
Do you know what that says?

39:38.921 --> 39:41.089
It's Aug… No, I got it. August 2nd.

39:41.173 --> 39:43.175
Diplomatic immunity.

39:43.258 --> 39:44.927
Right.

39:45.010 --> 39:47.054
Oh, look. Here's one from yesterday.

39:47.137 --> 39:49.181
Handicapped parking zone.

39:49.264 --> 39:50.682
You look healthy to me.

39:50.766 --> 39:53.477
-KYI: Diplomatic immunity.
-Ambassador?

39:54.520 --> 39:56.939
What are you doing?
You can't open the pouch.

39:57.022 --> 39:58.273
Put it back. Put everything back.

39:58.357 --> 40:00.025
-RAM: It was on fire. I didn't…
-What do we have here?

40:00.901 --> 40:02.444
You tampered with that pouch.

40:03.070 --> 40:05.739
Ooh. You should call the police,
have them look into that.

40:05.822 --> 40:09.034
Give that to me.
It's official Myanmar property.

40:09.117 --> 40:11.078
Actually, it's stolen property.

40:11.161 --> 40:13.247
He took that from a diplomatic pouch.

40:13.330 --> 40:15.374
No. I took it from a street in Manhattan.

40:15.457 --> 40:17.626
And now it's evidence.

40:17.709 --> 40:19.211
You can't do that.

40:19.294 --> 40:21.588
Oh, actually, we can.

40:21.672 --> 40:25.342
But rest assured, whoever took
this external drive will be dealt with.

40:34.351 --> 40:37.062
Any blowback from the Burmese
over the external drive?

40:37.145 --> 40:39.648
They can't admit it exists.

40:39.731 --> 40:41.567
Footage of the rebels?

40:41.650 --> 40:44.945
It's in US hands now.
Their identities are protected.

40:45.028 --> 40:47.447
Chris is probably more worried
about them than himself.

40:47.531 --> 40:49.575
-PETER: Hmm.
-Sounds like my son.

40:58.876 --> 41:01.587
Mr. Wilson. I am Mr. Nitza.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.174
I'll be replacing Mr. Kyi
as ambassador of the Myanmar mission.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.759
He had to return home for health reasons.

41:08.927 --> 41:10.304
Sorry to hear that.

41:10.387 --> 41:14.266
My country's sincerest apologies
for your family's inconvenience.

41:14.349 --> 41:15.601
Thank you.

41:21.607 --> 41:22.608
Chris.

41:30.532 --> 41:33.368
Thank you for getting my son home to me.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.788
I know it was unconventional.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.000
That's our specialty.

41:42.336 --> 41:43.462
Dad?

41:50.969 --> 41:53.347
You asked me about my dad.

41:54.681 --> 41:57.476
I think my mom told me
what any kid would wanna hear.

41:58.685 --> 42:01.230
That he was a hero?

42:01.313 --> 42:02.314
He wasn't.

42:03.023 --> 42:04.274
He was a dirty cop.

42:05.484 --> 42:06.568
You're not him.

42:06.652 --> 42:10.781
If I'm not my father's son, who am I?

42:14.117 --> 42:17.496
Certain things are in my blood.

42:17.579 --> 42:18.830
I don't believe it.

42:20.666 --> 42:22.376
You did that.

42:22.459 --> 42:25.212
Christopher is free because of you.

42:30.717 --> 42:32.594
-Tell me about your mother.
-Not a chance.

42:32.678 --> 42:34.054
-Come on. Did she wear hats?
-No.
