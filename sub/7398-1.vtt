02:23.443 --> 02:27.277
I'd have to go with, uh...
Anwar Sadat.

02:27.347 --> 02:29.941
Anwar Sadat?

02:30.016 --> 02:31.984
<i>- The former Egyptian president. </i>
- Right.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.747
<i>No, no. Two years at the paper, </i>
<i>I never heard that one. </i>

02:34.821 --> 02:40.691
I'd have to say Sadat.
Talk about standing up to
political and popular pressure.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.695
I'd like to think
that I had those kind of balls.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.527
There's a guy who did not die
in vain. He died for peace.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.533
Any ideas you'd die for,
Governor?

02:48.601 --> 02:52.662
Obviously I'd die
for this country.

02:52.739 --> 02:56.300
- I served, you know,
not in Vietnam but Desert Storm.
<i>- Right. The Bronze Star. </i>

02:56.376 --> 02:58.810
There wasn't a lot of shit
to get into there, but I was in it.

02:58.878 --> 03:02.245
What I meant was,
would you take a bullet...

03:02.315 --> 03:07.082
<i>to advance abortion rights, flat taxes, </i>
<i>things you've been behind for years? </i>

03:07.153 --> 03:10.782

04:47.153 --> 04:49.212
Governor, excuse me.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.986
Bottom line. You put your ass on the
line out there. This guy from the <i>Post... </i>

04:53.059 --> 04:55.186
Paul Smith is his name.

04:55.261 --> 04:58.662
He's describing what you did as if
you should get the Medal of Honor.

04:58.731 --> 05:02.827
That isn't the reality, is it? She died.
In the end, that's the reality.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.870
There's one reality here,
Governor.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.030
<i>The people have given you</i>
<i>Reagan-like approval numbers. </i>

05:07.106 --> 05:10.132
<i>- Last week were in the 50s, </i>
<i>today you were at 82.</i>
- Look at it this way.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.734
That girl died.
That's a tragedy.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.838
But you did everything
you could possibly do to save her.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.351
They couldn't save the Alamo, either,
but everyone who died there's a hero.

05:19.419 --> 05:23.480
- We're at a commercial.
You're almost up, okay?
- Okay.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.615
Show your remorse,
but don't be broken.

05:25.692 --> 05:29.150
You're a national leader now.
Think that way.

05:29.228 --> 05:33.562
- Is Bert on our side?
- Absolutely.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.601
- Three, two, one.
<i>- This is it. </i>

05:35.668 --> 05:37.636
<i>[Fiona] After this, </i>
<i>everything will be on our side. </i>

05:37.704 --> 05:40.730
He has long been considered
at the top of President Evans's list...

05:40.807 --> 05:45.244
to fill the vacancy left by the death
of the vice president three weeks ago.

05:45.311 --> 05:51.079
But after the heroics that have become
the stuff of national legend...

05:51.150 --> 05:55.086
Governor Hathaway has become
the nation's choice...

05:55.154 --> 05:58.681
to take on the post of
the heir-apparent to the presidency.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.659
- Governor, thank you for joining us.
- Thank you, Bert.

06:01.728 --> 06:07.325
<i>That's a nasty bit of business, </i>
<i>what happened on that river. Nasty. </i>

06:07.400 --> 06:13.134
<i>It's a damn shame you were</i>
<i>the unlucky bastard in that spot. </i>

06:13.206 --> 06:18.143
Six and a half years in the White House,
press still hasn't gotten wind
of these bastards.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.341
Yeah, pretty, uh...

06:22.415 --> 06:25.282
<i>pretty heroic, </i>
<i>what you tried. </i>

06:28.187 --> 06:32.283
Just like everybody's
been saying, very, uh...

06:32.358 --> 06:35.885
- Pure Audie Murphy.
- Thank you, sir. I only wish...

06:35.962 --> 06:38.362
If it was me, I don't know if
I would've dove in there.

06:38.431 --> 06:41.889
Might have.
But honestly, I don't know.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.797

Well...

06:46.873 --> 06:51.503
At least for once, the press
is turning one of us into a hero.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.410
What was it like?

06:57.483 --> 07:00.418
It was...
It was cold.

07:00.486 --> 07:05.014
Oh, sure, this time of year. You were
risking your life saving that woman.

07:05.091 --> 07:09.152
- The cold alone could've
snapped you like a twig.
- It was dark under the water.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.527
The headlights were on.
So were the interior lights.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.601
I could see her face.

07:16.669 --> 07:20.469
She was very pretty. Young.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.804
<i>-She was terrified. </i>
- Wow.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.400
It was like
she was being buried alive.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.844
<i>She looked at me. </i>

07:27.914 --> 07:32.476
And then she had
this look of helplessness.

07:32.552 --> 07:36.079
l, I tried to pull
at the door, but, uh...

07:36.155 --> 07:39.249
I needed air, you know?

07:39.325 --> 07:42.260
I couldn't...

07:42.328 --> 07:46.424
<i>No. By the time I got back down</i>
<i>to the car, she was dead. </i>

07:49.335 --> 07:53.669
Her face was frozen in that look.
She carried that look of terror...

07:53.739 --> 07:55.673
<i>right into her death. </i>

07:55.741 --> 07:58.232
You did more
than most men would.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.007
I wonder.

08:03.850 --> 08:09.288
Look, Jack, it's just not gonna happen.
I can't nominate you.

08:09.355 --> 08:12.620
<i>I can't put you up. </i>

08:12.692 --> 08:15.456
<i>We can't have</i>
<i>another Chappaquiddick. </i>

08:15.528 --> 08:19.931
- I tried to save her.
Kennedy ran away, remember?
<i>- You failed. </i>

08:19.999 --> 08:22.593
Nobody's saying
it was your fault, but you failed.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.035
<i>[Evans]</i>
<i>It's a bad beef, Jack. </i>

<i>of this party, a rising star... </i>

08:28.741 --> 08:31.141

They're not gonna give
a rat's ass about that.

08:33.746 --> 08:38.046
They're not gonna care
about your years of service
or what you've done for education.

08:38.116 --> 08:43.214
This would be it.
A girl died and...

08:43.289 --> 08:45.519
- This administration needs
a smooth confirmation.
- You let it happen.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.559
We had a rocky time
over the crime bill.

08:47.627 --> 08:51.586
<i>Can't have any more obstacles</i>
<i>put in front of us. </i>

08:53.332 --> 08:58.531
Well, I appreciate you
telling me personally, Mr. President.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.697
I'll, uh...

09:00.773 --> 09:03.469
I'll support
whoever you select, of course.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.704
I know that.

09:05.778 --> 09:08.508
You're the future
of the Democratic Party...

09:08.581 --> 09:11.049
and you always will be.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.450
Well, there's a boatload
of press out there.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.514
I don't think
you should avoid them.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.825
Take it easy, Jack.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.525
I don't understand this, Kermit.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.660
Six years ago I was the best man for
the job, and I'm still the right guy.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.204
- I have a great relationship
with Runyon...
- Listen to me.

09:33.272 --> 09:36.070
- Isn't there something
we can do about this?
- Believe me, I've tried.

09:36.142 --> 09:40.943
He's made up his mind. Filling this slot
may well be his swan song.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.777
Wants to be careful with it.
Let's not push it.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.976
Why not keep
in his good graces?

09:46.052 --> 09:48.953
You're a good man, Jack.
Want to see the governor out?

09:49.021 --> 09:52.013
- Jerry, you want to come in?
- Yes, sir.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.987
Mr. President,
Jerry's here.

09:57.063 --> 10:01.363
That was as rough as it comes.
Never seen anybody look so defeated.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.028
- Yeah, poor son of a bitch.
- Mr. President?

10:04.103 --> 10:07.163
Saw the governor out there. Looks like
he had the shit kicked out of him.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.868
If I have any more caffeine,
I'll be voting for the flat tax.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.037
I got this tea
from the Greek ambassador.

10:14.113 --> 10:18.277
Go on, sit. Never thought of Greece
as a tea-producing country...

10:18.351 --> 10:22.720
but, Jesus Christ,
if this isn't the tea to end all teas.

10:24.056 --> 10:29.358
Well, looks likeJack Hathaway's
had a shitty week.

10:29.428 --> 10:33.626
So Hathaway, he's out?
That's solid?

10:33.699 --> 10:36.759
That leaves us
with Malloy or Hanson.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.964
It's gotta be Hanson.
Malloy's out.

10:40.039 --> 10:43.372
- Now, Mr. President, I think you know...
- It's Hanson.

10:43.442 --> 10:48.402
You know how I feel. Hanson
may have turncoated our way,
but a turncoat's a turncoat.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.679
We've had a vacancy for three weeks. The
nation's moved from mourning to anxiety.

10:52.752 --> 10:57.849
I need a vice president. And I need a
person who's gonna reflect my politics.

10:57.923 --> 11:02.792
- Fill it with Frank Malloy.
- No, no. Malloy's got
an inflammation of ambition.

11:02.862 --> 11:07.424
He won't be doing his job.
He'll be preparing to do mine.
He's not even my second choice.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.991
If it doesn't work with Hanson,
we're gonna go back to Hathaway.

11:10.069 --> 11:15.564
- Do you think Hanson's a team player?
- Senator Hanson is gonna work.

11:15.641 --> 11:20.169
And it's the job of you two to make sure
that confirmation gets through.

11:20.246 --> 11:24.410
- I need to know I can count on you.
- Of course you can.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.914
The president and I discussed several
issues, including the vice presidency.

11:28.988 --> 11:34.654
<i>-[Man] Did the president</i>

12:08.360 --> 12:10.760
It's the president.
He wants to talk to you.

12:10.830 --> 12:14.732
You wanna speak to him?

12:14.800 --> 12:18.702
Hello, sir.
This is Senator Hanson speaking.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.307
Oh, Christ.

12:32.752 --> 12:38.190
That's what the prick said to you?
"We can't have another Chappaquiddick."

12:38.257 --> 12:40.191
No, not Evans. Newman said
the thing about Chappaquiddick.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.693
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.196
That doesn't even make
any sense, Jack.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.198
You weren't some drunk
who drove your car...

12:47.266 --> 12:50.030
<i>off a bridge and abandoned the whore</i>
<i>you were fucking to die. </i>

12:50.102 --> 12:52.400
That's what I told them.
Not in those words.

12:52.471 --> 12:56.771
This is the second time
they fucked us over.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.072
- Did he say who he was going with?
- No.

12:59.145 --> 13:03.104
- It's gonna be Malloy.
Fucking Frank Malloy.
- That's what I'm hearing.

13:03.182 --> 13:06.174
Jack, he isn't worthy of...

13:06.252 --> 13:09.744
- This isn't happening to me.
- You can go.

13:09.822 --> 13:13.485
You're gonna take it up the ass.
Want to bend over and make
their job a little easier?

13:13.559 --> 13:15.857
You understand
what's going on here?

13:15.928 --> 13:18.021
This is it.

13:18.097 --> 13:21.999
The whole fucking plan, Jack,
everything, was to get to this point.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.558
We have one shot at this,
and it's gone!

13:24.637 --> 13:30.371
And you're gonna mope around
like some 12-year-old girl
who can't get a date to the dance?

13:30.442 --> 13:32.535
"Frank Malloy,
that's what I'm hearing."

13:32.611 --> 13:36.672
- What would you like me to do?
- I'd like you to give a shit.

13:36.749 --> 13:41.550
I'd like you to call Shelly Runyon back
and get this fucking thing fixed!

13:41.620 --> 13:46.080
- Why not?
- You've already gone over it.
It's done, ancient history.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.456
I don't feel reconciled
about it yet.

13:48.527 --> 13:53.226
[Indistinct Chattering]

13:55.234 --> 13:57.930
- I'll think about it.
- No, I think it's fine.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.439
Okay, I'm not convinced.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.634
Thanks.

14:03.709 --> 14:07.201
You sure you want
to have alcohol on your breath
the first time you meet the president?

14:07.279 --> 14:09.907
- No, you're right.
<i>- No offense. Just wondering. </i>

14:12.618 --> 14:16.884
Whoa, whoa.
I haven't been confirmed yet.
I haven't even been asked yet.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.322
You know what we gotta do pronto?
We gotta start working Runyon.

14:19.391 --> 14:22.588
- Runyon's gonna be a problem.
<i>- Why is Runyon gonna be a problem? </i>

14:22.661 --> 14:25.630
<i>- 'Cause he's head ofJudiciary. </i>
- But the Senate takes care...

14:25.698 --> 14:28.565
<i>Everything but the vice president. </i>
<i>Twenty-fifth amendment</i>
<i>doesn't specify... </i>

14:28.634 --> 14:31.000
<i>who runs the show</i>
<i>on that confirmation. </i>

14:31.070 --> 14:34.506
Rumor has it that the House
has advise and consent on this one.

14:34.573 --> 14:38.839
<i>- Runyon lobbied just hard enough</i>
<i>to get his committee the gig. </i>
- Yeah, I think he did.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.675
I know his number-two guy, Ted Baker.
We went to college together.
I'll phone him.

14:41.747 --> 14:45.774
- I'll start pummeling him.
- No, no, no.
Don't say anything to him yet.

14:45.851 --> 14:49.343
<i>- Why? </i>
- Let's get it on our own merit for now.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.117
You know what?
I'm not gonna argue with you.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.649
Not only are you right,
but you're about to meet the president,
and you look great.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.027
<i>- Doesn't she look great? </i>
<i>- Yeah, she looks great. </i>

14:59.098 --> 15:01.225
What do you think, Stevenson?

15:01.300 --> 15:05.669
I'd go for the number six,
slightly right of center, sir.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.706
That's what I was thinking.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.937
That's what I was thinking.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.979
<i>[Evans]</i>
<i>How's your average? </i>

15:14.046 --> 15:18.483
- One forty-five last time out, sir.
- That's not bad.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.720
No!

15:28.794 --> 15:31.888
That's what I get
for my leftist tendencies.

15:31.964 --> 15:35.024
- Senator Hanson
and her husband are here.
<i>- Bring 'em in. </i>

15:35.100 --> 15:37.034
Yes, sir.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.799
- I'm gonna need some time
with the senator.
- Yes, sir.

15:40.873 --> 15:44.502
- Senator!
<i>- Mr. President. </i>

15:44.576 --> 15:48.068
- You remember my husband.
- Will Hanson. The McMahon campaign.

15:48.147 --> 15:52.447
We tried to steal your husband away.
He runs a hell of a campaign.

15:52.518 --> 15:57.182
You gave me nightmare visions
of having to return to my law practice.

15:57.256 --> 16:00.623
- Hi. Jackson Evans.
- Lewis Hollis.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.526
- What was the first name?
- Hollis.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.655
- No, Lewis is my first name.
- Lewis. Welcome, Lewis.

16:06.732 --> 16:10.133
So, have you guys
been down here before?

16:10.202 --> 16:12.500
- [Together] No.
<i>-Johnson, he, uh... </i>

16:12.571 --> 16:14.539
built it in '65.

16:14.606 --> 16:18.599
Right now some terrorist camp in Libya
is being spared a bombing raid...

16:18.677 --> 16:23.011
because I'm obsessed
with beating my 150 average.

16:23.082 --> 16:27.348
- You guys bowl?
<i>- Once in a while. </i>

16:27.419 --> 16:29.353
What's your average?

16:29.421 --> 16:31.286
- Seventy.
- I don't have one.

16:31.357 --> 16:34.622
Hungry? You want some lunch
before we speak?

16:34.693 --> 16:37.253
<i>No, thank you, sir. </i>

16:37.329 --> 16:41.095
<i>[Evans] I saw this movie once</i>
<i>where the president... </i>

16:41.166 --> 16:44.693
is just tickled that anything he wants
to eat he can get in a moment's notice.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.432
Here. Turns out, it's the perk
of the century.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.440
- Otto?
- Yes, Mr. President?

16:49.508 --> 16:53.877
Sorry for the late notice. For lunch,
could you arrange coq au vin...

16:53.946 --> 16:57.143
with a side of penne?

16:57.216 --> 16:59.548
<i>-[Otto] Spicy or mild? </i>
- Spicy.

16:59.618 --> 17:03.452
And, uh... Oh...

17:03.522 --> 17:07.252
- Hazelnut pudding for dessert.
<i>- No problem, sir. </i>

17:07.326 --> 17:09.886
One day I'll catch him napping.

17:09.962 --> 17:14.330
- Anyway, how much
did we win that one by?
- 61 to 33, sir.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.358
It's pretty easy
getting over things when you win.

17:18.436 --> 17:22.396
I guess Sudan is where the press
will make its first hay.

17:22.473 --> 17:26.808
I think if we announce,
the press might have
other things on its mind.

17:26.878 --> 17:31.441
But you know,
Sheldon Runyon and Jack Hathaway
have been friends for years.

17:31.517 --> 17:35.146
And Runyon is going to come after me
with all guns blazing.

17:35.220 --> 17:40.556
Senator, why do we have to worry
about Shelly Runyon's guns
when I control the atomic bomb?

17:40.626 --> 17:44.756
We'll introduce you
to the Cabinet in one hour.
I'll make the announcement then.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.856
- That's fine, Mr. President.
- That's the wayJerry Ford
did it with Rockefeller.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.993
I always thought it was pretty damn
classy. Have we notified the networks?

17:51.070 --> 17:54.562
Oh, yes. All the pundits
are in a guessing feeding frenzy.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.076
Box of Malomars says
they've already anointed Malloy.

17:58.143 --> 18:02.170
- You look great, by the way. Just great.
- Thank you, sir.

18:02.247 --> 18:06.809
Okay, guys, one hour,
the Cabinet Room.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.285
<i>Off to the races! </i>

18:09.354 --> 18:13.017
- Senator, is this
what you're gonna wear?
- She looks fine.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.356
- No, she does.
- You look beautiful, Senator.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.452
- Thank you.
- Very becoming.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.463
I think it works.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.595
Let me explain
how this is gonna work.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.192
In a minute, POTUS is gonna come in,
make an announcement...

18:24.269 --> 18:27.261
- Introduce you
to the vice presidential designate.
<i>-Jerry. </i>

18:27.339 --> 18:30.570
We hear the president's decision
is Malloy. Can you confirm this?

18:30.642 --> 18:34.510
In ten seconds you're gonna have
your answer. So calm down.

18:34.580 --> 18:39.017
All right. Then after he's made...
Dave. [Whispers]

18:39.084 --> 18:42.247
I'm gonna give you guys
20 minutes for questions and answers.

18:42.321 --> 18:45.085
So keep them short
and, hopefully, sweet.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.591
And you can roll starting now.

18:47.659 --> 18:50.856
I'll introduce him
in five... thousand...

18:50.929 --> 18:55.832
four... thousand,
three... thousand, two.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.837
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

19:03.242 --> 19:07.144
Welcome. Good afternoon.
Please.

19:07.212 --> 19:11.945
- Thank you for coming here
on such short notice.
<i>- Laine Hanson, from Ohio. </i>

19:12.017 --> 19:15.919
As I embarked on the task
of selecting a vice president...

19:15.988 --> 19:18.752
I was driven by the emotion
of wanting to make a choice...

19:18.824 --> 19:22.453
that would've made Troy Ellard,
my friend, proud.

19:22.528 --> 19:26.555
Senator Laine Billings Hanson
of Ohio is that person.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.725
<i>[Toliver]</i>
<i>Sherri, you are first. </i>

19:28.800 --> 19:34.102
<i>Ms. Hanson, do you feel being</i>
<i>a woman played any type of role</i>
<i>in the president's decision? </i>

19:34.173 --> 19:37.768
Well, l, uh...
First I would like to say...

19:37.843 --> 19:41.540
what an honor it is to be here
before you in this position.

19:41.613 --> 19:46.073
And I hope to serve up to the
standards which President Evans
set for me in that introduction.

19:46.151 --> 19:49.917
Thank you so much, sir.
To answer your question...

19:49.988 --> 19:54.152
- First rate, Mrs. Hanson.
- Thank you. I learned
a lot from Will.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.854
Ah, yes, Will.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.920
You, sir, are gonna have
to make yourself scarce.

19:58.997 --> 20:03.661
- No, of course.
I'll give you your privacy.
- No, I mean scarce.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.999
During the confirmation period,
I want you out of sight.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.733
- Pardon me?
<i>-A wife there behind her husband... </i>

20:08.807 --> 20:11.173
is perceived as supportive.

20:11.243 --> 20:16.340
A husband following around behind
his wife is perceived as a puppeteer.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.975
- But I think...
- No, honey. I think
Mr. Newman's right on.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.985
Let Hollis handle
the day-to-day...

20:21.053 --> 20:23.749
- And I'll be the man behind the curtain.
- Where do we go from here?

20:23.822 --> 20:27.952
<i>The FBI's gonna have to do</i>
<i>an extensive background check. </i>

20:28.026 --> 20:31.427
- Director Friend
will handle the investigation.
- Yes, we made sure of that.

20:31.496 --> 20:34.795
<i>Just about every aspect of your life</i>
<i>will be uncovered. </i>

20:34.866 --> 20:37.960
Your bank accounts,
your medical reports.

20:38.036 --> 20:41.301
- What am I forgetting?
<i>- Correspondence to</i>
<i>government agencies, speeches... </i>

20:41.373 --> 20:45.810
When Nelson Rockefeller was confirmed,
they had over 300 agents working on him.

20:45.877 --> 20:49.142
They had a lot more life
and cash to investigate, huh?

20:49.214 --> 20:53.310
<i>We'll do our own background</i>
<i>check in case anything falls</i>
<i>through the cracks, to be safe. </i>

20:53.385 --> 20:57.344
- At the same time,
the House will... Come in.
<i>-[Knocking At Door]</i>

20:57.422 --> 20:59.982
The House will put together
its bipartisan subcommittee...

21:00.058 --> 21:04.290
of theJudiciary to interview you and
advise and consent to your nomination.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.695
Shelly Runyon's
running the show there.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.724
Cheyenne, Wyoming, you're on with
Vice President Designate Laine Hanson.

21:10.802 --> 21:13.168
- [Man] Larry, how are you?
- I'm fine. Thanks for calling.

21:13.238 --> 21:16.469
I just wanted to say
to the senator that...

21:16.541 --> 21:18.668
all of Cheyenne is with her.

21:18.744 --> 21:22.680
We think she's absolutely great for
the country and this administration.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.774
- Congratulations.
- [King] What's the question, sir?

21:25.851 --> 21:29.810
<i>I wanted to ask the senator, if she</i>
<i>could pick one person from history... </i>

21:29.888 --> 21:33.517
<i>to serve as her model for how to behave</i>
<i>in office, who would that be? </i>

21:33.592 --> 21:36.322
<i>-[Knock At Door]</i>
<i>-[King] Good question, Senator. </i>

21:36.395 --> 21:40.331
<i>Hey, guys. </i>
<i>Nice to see you. </i>

21:40.399 --> 21:45.496
<i>-Sorry to barge in on you. </i>
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just watching your girl.

21:45.570 --> 21:49.062
- First female prime ministers?
- They were great leaders.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.268
Would you put Thatcher
in that category?

21:51.343 --> 21:53.675
No, I don't think so.

21:53.745 --> 21:57.681
- You know what? I would
have to say Thomas Jefferson.
- [King] A man?

21:57.749 --> 22:00.650
<i>-She's something, isn't she? </i>
- I don't really know her.

22:00.719 --> 22:05.088
We served together
a few years ago, and, I guess...

22:05.157 --> 22:08.217
we just ended up
in different company.

22:08.293 --> 22:12.195
- Take a seat.
<i>- Congressman, the president</i>
<i>asked us to come down here. </i>

22:12.264 --> 22:15.791
<i>He'd like to let you know</i>
<i>he'd appreciate your support</i>
<i>in the senator's confirmation. </i>

22:15.867 --> 22:21.134
- Really?
<i>- He asked me directly, Shell. </i>

22:21.206 --> 22:24.039
But the president didn't consider it
important enough to ask me personally?

22:24.109 --> 22:27.875
<i>You know it's important. </i>
<i>It's the old man's swan song. </i>

22:27.946 --> 22:30.540
<i>Putting a woman in office</i>
<i>means something to him. </i>

22:30.615 --> 22:33.379
Laine Hanson's
the absolute best choice.

22:33.452 --> 22:38.412
You don't believe that.
Come on. You're too smart.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.118
Look, I don't mind
she's a woman...

22:41.193 --> 22:45.562
but I'm not confirming a woman
just because she's a woman.

22:45.630 --> 22:48.622
Laine Hanson
has an extra burden.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.897
She's has to come on the world stage
with perfect credentials.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.165
Margaret Thatcher didn't have perfect
credentials. The world respected her.

22:54.239 --> 22:58.676
The world accepted Margaret Thatcher
because they knew she had to answer
to Ronald Reagan.

22:58.744 --> 23:03.272
A woman better be pretty damn qualified
to have nobody to answer to...

23:03.348 --> 23:07.842
and Laine Hanson
is not that.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.683
Look me in the eyes
and tell me...

23:10.756 --> 23:15.420
that Laine Hanson is your first choice
for the vice presidency.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.923
Laine Hanson
is my absolute first choice.

23:23.568 --> 23:26.093
I'd so want you
in my poker game.

23:31.042 --> 23:33.602
Country needs
a smooth confirmation.

23:33.678 --> 23:35.612
The president needs
a smooth confirmation.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.343
- The country needs
a competent vice president.
<i>-[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

23:39.418 --> 23:41.784
Excuse me a minute.

23:41.853 --> 23:45.846
There's only one person in the world
that has that phone number.

23:45.924 --> 23:50.054
So who's the second choice?

23:50.128 --> 23:52.790
We haven't really settled
on anybody yet.

23:52.864 --> 23:56.891
Tell me, if Laine Hanson were
to be hit by a flying car...

23:56.968 --> 23:59.562
who would the president
then select?

24:01.339 --> 24:03.330
[Sighs]

24:03.408 --> 24:06.707
I think the president
still likes Jack Hathaway, Congressman.

24:13.218 --> 24:14.845
<i>You know... </i>

24:14.920 --> 24:19.516
Jack Hathaway, there's a good man...
for a Democrat.

24:19.591 --> 24:23.288
[Laughs] There's a man
I would say would have...

24:23.361 --> 24:26.057
a smooth confirmation.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.725
- Jack Hathaway?
- Smooth as a baby's ass.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.463
- He's already taken himself
out of it, so...
<i>- Right. </i>

24:32.537 --> 24:35.028
Right!
Well, who the hell knows?

24:35.106 --> 24:38.371
Perhaps Lainey
will shock the world...

24:38.443 --> 24:40.673
by pulling out
her brilliance...

24:40.745 --> 24:43.441
<i>and erudition at the hearings</i>
<i>that none of us know she has. </i>

24:43.515 --> 24:46.177
So, Shelly, can we ask
for basic fairness?

24:46.251 --> 24:50.779
<i>- Fifty-fifty, Democrat and</i>
<i>Republican at the hearings? </i>
- Of course you can.

25:01.766 --> 25:05.293
Congressman! Congressman!
Mr. Runyon.

25:05.370 --> 25:08.498
Just wanted to steal you
for a second. I'm Reg Webster.

25:08.573 --> 25:12.942
- Oh, you're one of Stoney's boys?
- Uh, no.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.138
You staff or intern?

25:15.213 --> 25:18.649
Actually I'm a representative.
Reginald Webster of Delaware.

25:18.717 --> 25:22.175
Oh, fuck me. I'm sorry, Webster.
What can I do for you?

25:22.254 --> 25:26.520
- I'm running late.
- I was hoping I could grab
your attention for a second.

25:26.591 --> 25:29.822
- What's the skinny?
- Well, uh...

25:29.895 --> 25:34.764
- I'm late, Mr. Webster.
- I understand a chair's
opened up in the committee...

25:34.833 --> 25:36.858
and I'd like
to put my name forward.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.665
I believe you'll find me
industrious and hardworking.

25:39.738 --> 25:43.105
TheJudiciary's
for senior members.

25:43.174 --> 25:46.632
Wheeling was in for five terms
before we let him in.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.179
My hands are tied.
There's nothing I can do.

25:49.247 --> 25:51.807
Shelly, I've been trying
to reach you for five days.

25:51.883 --> 25:55.046
- I left you 3 2 messages.
- Well, leave me a 33rd.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.953
- Where you from?
- Delaware.

25:58.023 --> 26:02.323
Oh, yeah, you were...
You knocked Emory Bettis out.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.022
Emory used to be
in the Thursday night game.

26:05.096 --> 26:07.656
He was always good
for a few hundred bucks.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.257
I guess he ran his campaign
like he played poker.

26:10.335 --> 26:14.499
I take it you have
a predisposition.

26:14.573 --> 26:18.839
- About the confirmation, I mean.
- No. Actually, I'm 100% objective.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.107
- Mmm. Do you have
a dictionary, Mr. Webster?
- Yeah.

26:22.180 --> 26:25.775
Take a Magic Marker,
cross out the word "objectivity."

26:25.850 --> 26:30.753
Your constituents want you
for your opinions, your philosophy...

26:30.822 --> 26:33.484
for your subjectivity.

26:38.930 --> 26:41.797
Laver has to duck
out of the way of that one.

26:41.866 --> 26:45.734
<i>One that Laver can't get. </i>
<i>He's still trying to recover. </i>

26:48.173 --> 26:51.540
And he zings another
powerful forehand past Laver.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.976
See that, Tim-Tim?
Know what we call that?

26:54.045 --> 26:57.378
- We call that topspin.
You know how we get topspin?
- Uh-huh.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.646
<i>- Yeah? Tell me. </i>
- 'Cause BabyJesus made topspin.

27:00.719 --> 27:02.653
<i>What? </i>

27:02.721 --> 27:05.155
<i>- BabyJesus gave it topspin. </i>
- Jesus?

27:05.223 --> 27:07.851
Ah! Why do you say that?

27:07.926 --> 27:12.556
- Because BabyJesus made everything.
- Yeah? Who told you that?

27:12.631 --> 27:15.099
<i>Miss Moyer in kindergarten, </i>
<i>and Mommy says... </i>

27:15.166 --> 27:18.693
<i>- I have to listen Miss Moyer. </i>
- Wow, this is news to me.

27:18.770 --> 27:23.173
I gave up my career
trying to strike that nonsense
out of the public school system.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.539
Maybe I ought to put him
in public school, then.

27:25.610 --> 27:27.544
Remember what I told you
about moving your grip down...

27:27.612 --> 27:30.172
- And to the left?
- Uh-huh.

27:30.248 --> 27:33.513
- Go see if Dad's found
his bathing suit yet.
- Gimme a hug.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.051
Yeah. Thanks, champ.

27:43.428 --> 27:47.159
- They are paid to teach, not...
- To preach.

27:47.232 --> 27:50.531
I know, but he's six years old, and he
also believes in the tooth fairy...

27:50.602 --> 27:55.198
- And that George Washington
never told a lie.
- Well, it drives me crazy.

27:55.273 --> 27:58.333
- Mary, wanna turn the ball machine off?
<i>- Yes, Mr. Governor. </i>

28:02.180 --> 28:04.114
Thanks for seeing me, Dad.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.616
- Why wouldn't I see you?
- Partisanship.

28:06.685 --> 28:10.280
I gotta love
at least one Democrat.

28:13.391 --> 28:18.988
You know, Dad, I'm getting some reports
that you might not be ready to back me.

28:19.064 --> 28:21.555
That you're opposed
to my confirmation...

28:21.633 --> 28:23.430
- You've heard quotes?
- No, I haven't heard.

28:23.501 --> 28:26.231
Just that we should expect
to be reading of your opposition.

28:26.304 --> 28:29.102
Pardon my Swahili, but you're being led
a line of pure bullshit.

28:29.174 --> 28:34.578
- I haven't said a word.
<i>- Maybe it's just that. </i>
<i>Maybe you've been quiet. </i>

28:34.646 --> 28:37.342
- I hate the press.
<i>- I know, Dad. </i>

28:37.415 --> 28:40.942
- When I left the mansion,
I swore I would never talk to them.
<i>- I remember. </i>

28:41.019 --> 28:46.184
- I suppose you're gonna force
my hand on this, huh?
- You wouldn't have to say much.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.248
- Just a little something.
- Okay, okay.

28:48.326 --> 28:51.693
l, uh...

28:51.763 --> 28:53.924
I'll call back
Joe Glynn at the <i>Times. </i>

28:53.998 --> 28:56.523
He's okay.
He'll write it up well.

28:56.601 --> 28:59.297
I once leaked him
some shit about Buchanan.
Damn near won him the Pulitzer.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.702
- Thanks, Dad.
- Sure.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.707
Thanks.

29:03.775 --> 29:07.404
What would you do,
or have done, in my case?

29:07.479 --> 29:11.779
Well, when your president
asks you to jump...

29:11.850 --> 29:14.341
it's hard not to jump,
that's for sure.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.115
But you remember what Ben Franklin
said about the vice presidency.

29:17.188 --> 29:19.952
What did he say?
I didn't talk to him this week.

29:20.024 --> 29:24.984
He said he ought to be addressed as
"Your Superfluous Excellency."

29:25.063 --> 29:28.396
In the past ten years,
I've enjoyed the kind of power
the vice presidency can't offer.

29:28.466 --> 29:31.026
Why would anybody want
to give that up? Am I crazy?

29:31.102 --> 29:34.594
Baby, power is
where power goes.

29:34.672 --> 29:37.971
- Think you can beat me?
- Uh, yeah. Okay.

29:38.042 --> 29:40.909
Hey, Tony!

29:40.979 --> 29:43.447
Foul!

29:43.515 --> 29:47.315
Can't trust
those fuckin' people.

29:47.385 --> 29:52.254
Speaking of which, Mr. Webster,
it turns out you're a Democrat.

29:52.323 --> 29:55.724
l, uh, wasn't keeping it
a secret.

29:55.794 --> 30:00.231
Sad to say, I don't think I can
bring you aboard the committee, son.

30:00.298 --> 30:04.064
<i>Ray Spies makes all the decisions</i>
<i>regarding the other party. </i>

30:04.135 --> 30:06.262
<i>- It's a courtesy. </i>
- But not a requirement.

30:06.337 --> 30:09.067
- It's not, that's true.
<i>- If Ray Spies interviewed me... </i>

30:09.140 --> 30:11.631
he'd refuse to put me
on the committee even for a minute...

30:11.709 --> 30:13.768
because he'd find out that
when it comes to Laine Hanson...

30:13.845 --> 30:16.336
I went to my dictionary
and crossed off the word "objectivity."

30:16.414 --> 30:21.113
Are you suggesting Mrs. Hanson may not
be your first choice for vice president?

30:21.186 --> 30:25.418
I'm suggesting that Laine Hanson
has stricken our party
with policies and attitudes...

30:25.490 --> 30:28.357
that are best served
across the aisle from where she came.

30:28.426 --> 30:31.953
I take it, like most
members of your party...

30:32.030 --> 30:35.227
your selection would be
Governor Hathaway.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.291
Governor Hathaway's a great man.

30:37.368 --> 30:41.065
He's a visionary,
a bona fide hero.

30:41.139 --> 30:45.473
- But he withdrew his name
from consideration.
- Minds can be changed.

30:45.543 --> 30:50.207
- How much discretion
can I count on from you?
- A hundred percent, sir.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.511
- Even from your own leadership?
- I said a hundred percent.

30:52.584 --> 30:57.317
Good. Good man.
Good man.

30:57.388 --> 31:01.119
I think if I make the rounds,
do the Sunday morning talk shows...

31:01.192 --> 31:04.525
raise the level of the game a bit,
outtalk her on the issues...

31:04.596 --> 31:09.363
Issues? What kind of fucking campaigns
are they running in Virginia?

31:09.434 --> 31:13.165
Not the kind I'm used to.
Jack, this whole thing
with the girl drowning...

31:13.238 --> 31:15.172
It's bullshit!

31:15.240 --> 31:18.403
- I was there, Shelly.
The president told me himself.
<i>- It's an excuse. </i>

31:18.476 --> 31:23.140
Jackson Evans has chosen to make
putting a woman in office his swan song.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.843
<i>Laine Hanson is the only</i>
<i>reasonable choice in your party. </i>

31:26.918 --> 31:30.479
He's not going with Boxer.
She's too liberal.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.456
He's not going with Jones
because she's older than he is.

31:33.524 --> 31:36.584
- There's Winslet.
- She's not coming off
the Supreme Court.

31:36.661 --> 31:40.461
<i>Laine Hanson is attractive. </i>
<i>She's a looker. </i>

31:40.531 --> 31:44.729
The mere fact that she was
a Republican means that she
can't be too far to the left.

31:44.802 --> 31:46.827
It's a perfect pedigree.

31:46.905 --> 31:51.342
We can't get you in by convincing him
you're the right man for the job.

31:51.409 --> 31:55.778
We have to convince him that
she's wrong. Once we do that, you're in.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.714
And Toliver,
he's as much as told me...

31:58.783 --> 32:00.944
I'm not going for a low blow.
It's not my way.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.987
You won't have to.

32:03.054 --> 32:06.023
<i>We have to go after her. We have</i>
<i>to make her wade in her own blood. </i>

32:06.090 --> 32:08.991
- Who did you say you were?
- I'm Makerowitz.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.824
- Makerowitz.
<i>- I'm sorry. That doesn't</i>
<i>mean much to me. </i>

32:11.896 --> 32:15.093
- Web got somebody...
- A friend of the Hathaway campaign.

32:15.166 --> 32:17.964
Who is footing the not-too-unimpressive
bill of Mr. Makerowitz.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.970
<i>Private citizen wants to do</i>
<i>their own investigation... </i>

32:20.038 --> 32:24.839
What exactly are you trying to find out?
Campaign irregularities, bribes?

32:24.909 --> 32:26.934
- Isn't that the FBI's responsibility?
- Yes, it is.

32:27.011 --> 32:30.071
But the FBI would not
find anything. All of her money
is tied up in blind trusts.

32:30.148 --> 32:34.812
The kind of improprieties
you're talking about,
I think that only helps her.

32:34.886 --> 32:38.913
Personally, I think the nation
would be relieved to know that
just because she's a woman...

32:38.990 --> 32:42.824
<i>-it doesn't mean she can't be</i>
<i>as ruthless as the rest of us. </i>
<i>- Governor? </i>

32:42.894 --> 32:46.159
You ever stabbed a man
in the navel? You?

32:46.230 --> 32:48.892
Me? No, I haven't.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.197
Stab a man in the navel,
and that's all she wrote.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.295
Bleeding is so swift and severe,
it wouldn't matter ifJesus put
His healing hand on the wound...

32:54.372 --> 32:56.306
<i>the bastard is dead. </i>

32:56.374 --> 32:58.604

32:58.676 --> 33:01.042
<i>We all have to understand, </i>
<i>we're going to obliterate her life... </i>

33:01.112 --> 33:04.445
<i>but it will get you</i>
<i>the vice presidency. </i>

33:20.932 --> 33:23.423
- Hey, Dog!
- Lewis, how you doin'?

33:23.501 --> 33:27.164
- Wow, that's a plate of food!
- [Laughs]

33:27.238 --> 33:29.638
You didn't have
to dress up for me.

33:29.707 --> 33:33.108
I had to accompany the senator
to the Gridiron Lunch.

33:33.177 --> 33:38.171
lfJohn Q. Public could see
the money that the knuckleheads
that run this country...

33:38.249 --> 33:41.013
spend on these lunches,
there would be a second revolution.

33:41.085 --> 33:46.523
I'm telling you, there is some money
spent on these stupid lunches.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.056
- What is this?
- It's the reason you're here.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.963
You can't let anybody know
where you got this from.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.695
If Runyon found out
I gave this to you...

33:57.769 --> 34:00.829
he'd fire me,
and I don't want him as an enemy.

34:00.905 --> 34:04.602
That's Lainey Hanson
getting gang-banged.

34:04.675 --> 34:07.235
Looks like something
out of <i>Hustler. </i>

34:07.311 --> 34:10.041
[Sighs]
That's her for sure.

34:13.985 --> 34:19.889
I know it's hard to tell with her...
her face in someone's crotch...

34:19.956 --> 34:23.051
but that's her, man.

34:23.127 --> 34:25.994
Why are you showing me this?

34:26.063 --> 34:28.793
I will not be party
to an ambush.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.402
Why are you
showing me this, Ted?

34:35.106 --> 34:37.802
Okay.

34:37.875 --> 34:42.608
I want out of Runyon's office.
And I thought maybe you could
get me on staff...

34:42.679 --> 34:45.649
This is the best you could
come up with? This shit?

34:45.716 --> 34:48.411
This is shit.

34:49.954 --> 34:53.150
Read the deposition
of the LaVamere lady.

34:54.891 --> 34:58.259
<i>[Woman's Voice]</i>
<i>She was putting on a sex show. </i>

34:58.329 --> 35:01.025
- How long did this go on for?
- It was hours.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.363
- How many hours?
- Three or four.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.868
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Which one? Three or four? </i>

35:05.937 --> 35:08.497
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Three, I guess. </i>

35:08.573 --> 35:11.940
<i>In her defense, </i>
<i>she was drunk. </i>

35:12.009 --> 35:15.069
<i>To be honest, once she finished fucking</i>
<i>and sucking those two assholes... </i>

35:15.146 --> 35:18.980
<i>she was carried into another room, and</i>
<i>boys were going in and out of there... </i>

35:19.050 --> 35:21.245
but I don't know
if she was fucking them.

35:21.319 --> 35:24.811
When she came out,
she was covered in cum. It was awful.

35:24.889 --> 35:28.791
Excuse me, Counselor.
l, um...

35:28.860 --> 35:30.851
- May I?
- Of course.

35:30.928 --> 35:36.798
Just to clarify, why exactly
was Mrs. Laine Hanson...

35:36.868 --> 35:41.168
Strike that.
Laine Billings involved in this, uh...

35:41.239 --> 35:43.469
appalling and disgusting behavior?

35:43.541 --> 35:45.532
- That's... That's what's important.
<i>- Exactly. </i>

35:45.610 --> 35:49.102
Thank you.
It's great to see you guys.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.478
- [Applauding, Cheering]

35:51.549 --> 35:54.347
Thank you so much
for your support. Thank you.

35:55.786 --> 35:57.720
Thank you.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.029
- Hey.
- Hey, Madam Senator.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.065
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

36:08.132 --> 36:11.295
I wish you'd heard the speech.
That line you gave me about...

36:11.369 --> 36:14.429
"If we can put a man
on the moon, then why can't we
put all men on the moon?"

36:14.505 --> 36:16.473
It was perfect.
It really broke the ice.

36:16.541 --> 36:20.033
- Great audience for that, huh?
- Yeah, it was great.

36:21.579 --> 36:23.979
- [Sighs]
- What's goin' on?

36:24.048 --> 36:26.243
Uh...

36:26.317 --> 36:29.047
well, it looks like Runyon
or somebody close to him...

36:29.120 --> 36:31.850
has been running
a little private investigation...

36:31.923 --> 36:35.324
Iooking for stuff that the Feds
wouldn't even touch.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.987
- It's, um...
- Yeah?

36:40.131 --> 36:42.361
What is it?

37:05.623 --> 37:08.114
What...

37:22.640 --> 37:25.905
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

37:29.380 --> 37:32.008
<i>- He doesn't know anything about it. </i>

I'm asking you to do what's in
the best interest of the party...

37:35.186 --> 37:37.814
and this president.

37:37.888 --> 37:42.985
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't do it, not over this.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.994
He's not going to allow me
or himself...

37:45.062 --> 37:48.293
<i>to get shot down over what would've</i>
<i>been a private sexual encounter. </i>

37:48.366 --> 37:52.564
- Some swan song for the old man, huh?
- It's fuckin' awful.

37:52.637 --> 37:57.506
<i>The senator got a little wild</i>
<i>when she was 19. What is the big deal? </i>

37:57.575 --> 37:59.770
Let me explain
the big deal to you.

37:59.844 --> 38:03.007
The people of this nation
can stomach quite a bit.

38:03.080 --> 38:07.847
But one thing they can't stomach
is the image of a vice president
with a mouthful of cock.

38:07.918 --> 38:12.878
<i>You don't have to use... Look. </i>
<i>Let's use the word "alleged. "</i>

38:12.957 --> 38:17.360
They got photos! They got witnesses!
They got the "alleged" slut...

38:17.428 --> 38:19.362
Hey! Let me tell you something.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.762
I'm her husband first.
I don't tolerate talk like that.

38:21.832 --> 38:25.598
- Will, calm down.
- You better get used to it, Will.

38:25.670 --> 38:29.800
Especially when not even your wife
will defend herself.

38:34.679 --> 38:39.309
Give me something, Laine.
Anything.

38:39.383 --> 38:43.319
Hell, just deny it.
Why don't you just deny it?

38:47.391 --> 38:50.326
It is simply
beneath my dignity.

39:06.711 --> 39:09.407
Dignity! Right.

39:11.082 --> 39:16.019
We'll just have to make this all
not worthwhile for Mr. Runyon.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.817
What have you got on the
distinguished gentleman from Illinois?

39:18.889 --> 39:21.517
Some pretty good stuff.

39:21.592 --> 39:24.493
- S.E.C. investigation, 1985.
<i>- You got stocks? </i>

39:24.562 --> 39:27.053
I want something embarrassing!

39:27.131 --> 39:30.430
Something sexual!

39:30.501 --> 39:32.594
Little boys, midgets,
that sort of thing.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.662
<i>- Cows! I don't give a goddamn! </i>
- Come on, Kermit.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.765
<i>If we do that, </i>
<i>we're no better than he is. </i>

39:37.842 --> 39:40.936
We are no better than he is.

39:41.011 --> 39:44.469
<i>There's nothing there. </i>
<i>He got married when he was 2 1.</i>

39:44.548 --> 39:46.516
There's no evidence
he ever cheated on his wife.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.610
Too bad we're not running in France.
We could really nail him on that one.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.283
When do you have
your lunch with him?

39:54.358 --> 39:57.122
With Shelly Runyon?
I'm not having lunch with him.

39:57.194 --> 39:59.662
<i>Friday, 1:00.</i>
<i>It's scheduled tomorrow. </i>

39:59.730 --> 40:02.198
It's automatic.
He's committee chairman.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.962
<i>It was set up. S.O.P. </i>

40:25.656 --> 40:27.749
- Laine.
- Shelly.

40:29.326 --> 40:32.762
I'm sorry I started.
You were late.

40:32.830 --> 40:35.355
- I'm not too late, I hope.
- A minute or two.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.891
- Were you tied up with anything?
- No, sorry. I'm just late.

40:38.969 --> 40:41.904
- Hi, Clem. You too.
- Senator, nice to see you.

40:41.972 --> 40:44.964
- I ordered you the porterhouse.
- No, I don't eat meat.

40:45.042 --> 40:48.341
- I'll have the penne.
- You should really... Mmm.

40:48.412 --> 40:51.870
- Try the steak. Ask Hugo
to burn it on the outside.
- No, thank you.

40:51.949 --> 40:54.474
I really don't eat meat.
I'll just go ahead with the penne.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.112
- Spicy?
- Yes, please. Thanks.

41:00.024 --> 41:05.155
So, how are...
Will and the boy?

41:05.229 --> 41:07.288
Let's forego
the small talk today, Shelly.

41:07.364 --> 41:11.892
- It'll make me feel cheap.
- Let the big talk begin.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.664
<i>Have you seen this? </i>

41:17.741 --> 41:20.608
That's my... That's my file
on you, Senator.

41:20.678 --> 41:23.112
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?

41:23.180 --> 41:26.343
Have you read it yet?

41:26.417 --> 41:28.408
How did you get it?

41:30.788 --> 41:34.087
<i>Have you read it? </i>

41:34.158 --> 41:38.219
- What do you have to say for yourself?
<i>- With all due respect... </i>

41:38.295 --> 41:40.263
um, Senator...

41:40.331 --> 41:43.266
- It doesn't matter what
I have to say for myself.
<i>- Oh, it doesn't? </i>

41:43.334 --> 41:48.966
It seems to me, Mr. Chairman,
all you can claim about me...
<i>claim, </i> is that I had sex...

41:49.039 --> 41:51.234
- Deviant sex.
<i>- Who says it was deviant? </i>

41:51.308 --> 41:53.242
I do.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.870
<i>And what I say, the people will believe. </i>
<i>And you know why? </i>

41:55.946 --> 41:59.939
Because I'll have a very big microphone
in front of me.

42:01.852 --> 42:04.514
Wow, you must
really hate me, Shelly.

42:04.588 --> 42:08.615
<i>I don't hate you. </i>
<i>It's not possible to hate you. You're... </i>

42:08.692 --> 42:12.093
What the hell was it that Reynolds
called you the other day?

42:12.162 --> 42:15.529
Groovy.
You're a groovy chick.

42:15.599 --> 42:19.365
No, what l, um, do detest
is your selfishness.

42:19.436 --> 42:22.837
<i>I have served this nation</i>
<i>without regard for personal</i>
<i>income for over ten years. </i>

42:22.907 --> 42:27.401
<i>You are selfish because you want to take</i>
<i>on a job that positions you to assume... </i>

42:27.478 --> 42:29.742
a mantle of gigantic
responsibility...

42:29.813 --> 42:32.247
and you do it full well
with the knowledge...

42:35.519 --> 42:37.783
Of what?

42:37.855 --> 42:39.789
<i>What? </i>

42:40.925 --> 42:44.292
Greatness is
the orphan of urgency, Laine.

42:44.361 --> 42:47.626
Greatness only emerges
when we need it most...

42:47.698 --> 42:51.759
in times of war
or calamity.

42:51.835 --> 42:55.271
I can't ask somebody
to be a Kennedy or a Lincoln.

42:55.339 --> 42:58.069
They were men
created by their times.

42:58.142 --> 43:02.306
What I can ask for
is the promise of greatness.

43:02.379 --> 43:05.610
And that, Madam Senator...

43:05.683 --> 43:07.708
you don't have.

43:11.388 --> 43:13.948
Well, then...

43:14.024 --> 43:17.152
I just wouldn't be using sex
as leverage...

43:17.227 --> 43:20.628
if I were you, Sheldon.

43:20.698 --> 43:23.360
<i>Because there's one thing</i>
<i>you don't want. </i>

43:23.434 --> 43:27.495
It's a woman with her finger
on the button who isn't getting laid.

43:27.571 --> 43:32.235
Will that be the argument the senator
offers up before the committee?

43:32.309 --> 43:34.777
[Laughing]

43:59.003 --> 44:02.962
<i>Sir? Can I get you</i>
<i>something to drink? </i>

44:03.040 --> 44:05.065
- Uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.
- You sure?

44:05.142 --> 44:07.508
No, great.
Thanks a lot.

44:41.045 --> 44:43.411
- Ah, Mr. Webster.
<i>- Mr. President. </i>

44:43.480 --> 44:45.414
- Good to see you.
- It's an honor, sir.

44:45.482 --> 44:48.178
- I've been meaning to have you
up here for some time.
- Really?

44:48.252 --> 44:53.485
Excuse me. Willie?
Thank you, Willie.

44:53.557 --> 44:57.084
Yeah, you betcha. You unseated
that old bastard Bettis.

44:57.161 --> 44:59.652
He must've voted against me
70 percent of the time.

44:59.730 --> 45:03.427
You know what this is?
That's a shark steak sandwich.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.764
Fucking shark steak.

45:05.836 --> 45:09.033
- You want half?
- Uh, no, thank you.

45:09.106 --> 45:13.406
- Are you a vegan? Had lunch?
- No. Uh...

45:13.477 --> 45:18.437
So you choose not to break bread with
the president of the United States?

45:19.917 --> 45:22.408
[Laughs]
Thank you.

45:22.486 --> 45:26.786
When I was in the Senate, Bettis
could always be counted to leave
half a grand at the poker table.

45:26.857 --> 45:30.190
Always stayed in, never folded.
Always wanted that miracle card.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.023
- That's good, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

45:32.096 --> 45:34.929
Now, Truman,
he was a poker player.

45:34.998 --> 45:38.058
Damn fine one,
as I understand it.

45:38.135 --> 45:40.603
Son, I understand you may be
making a mess of our plans...

45:40.671 --> 45:43.071
to put Laine Hanson
into the vice president mansion.

45:43.140 --> 45:46.701
Right now, sir, I cannot see
supporting Laine Hanson.

45:46.777 --> 45:50.008
- How old are you?
- Me, I'm 28.

45:50.080 --> 45:55.985
And at that age and experience,
you think you're the one
to sit and judge Mrs. Hanson?

45:56.053 --> 45:58.647
Well, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

45:58.722 --> 46:01.190
I am, sir.

46:03.127 --> 46:07.996
Mr. Webster,
I'm asking you to lay off...

46:08.065 --> 46:10.192
as a personal favor.

46:10.267 --> 46:13.259
It's one thing to break ranks
and vote against my candidate...

46:13.337 --> 46:15.999
but to actively attack her
from the bench, that's another.

46:16.073 --> 46:18.974
Mr. President, I just don't believe
in Laine Hanson...

46:19.042 --> 46:21.476
especially when we have
at our disposal Governor Hathaway.

46:21.545 --> 46:23.843
He's a party loyalist
and genuine hero.

46:23.914 --> 46:28.283
And I cannot and shall not vote for a
candidate simply because she's a woman.

46:28.352 --> 46:31.617
I am nothing if I do not
follow my heart, sir.

46:31.688 --> 46:34.179
I envy you.

46:34.258 --> 46:36.749
I do. You know why?

46:36.827 --> 46:41.764
Because someday, years from now, you're
gonna come in here with your family...

46:41.832 --> 46:45.097
and you're gonna look up
at my painting...

46:45.169 --> 46:48.161
and you'll be able to say to them,
your kids and grandkids...

46:48.238 --> 46:52.038
"Way back then
I defied my president.

46:52.109 --> 46:56.409
It cost me my reelection,
kept me out of politics forever.

46:56.480 --> 47:00.348
I was on the track
to maybe one day end up here...

47:00.417 --> 47:03.409
destined to make the kind of changes
in this country...

47:03.487 --> 47:06.422
that only great men, given the right
time and place, can make...

47:06.490 --> 47:10.950
and I have none of that now,
but that's okay...

47:11.028 --> 47:15.362
because I did
what was in my heart."

47:15.432 --> 47:19.926
The heart, it can never be wrong,
can it, Mr. Webster?

47:22.406 --> 47:27.070
Mmm. Delicious.
You got a little...

47:31.748 --> 47:34.046
Hi.

47:34.117 --> 47:36.347
<i>I'm Jack Hathaway. </i>
<i>How are you? </i>

47:36.420 --> 47:39.981
Hi, sir. Um...

47:40.057 --> 47:44.426
<i>Ow. I'm Special Agent Willomina. </i>
<i>Sure is good of you to meet me. </i>

47:44.494 --> 47:47.588
It's a pleasure.
How can I help you?

47:47.664 --> 47:53.000
I know you're busy, so this
will be as routine as it gets.

47:53.070 --> 47:57.131
- Did my girl offer you coffee
or something to drink?
<i>- Oh, yes, she did. </i>

47:57.207 --> 47:59.402
She was very nice, your girl.

47:59.476 --> 48:01.535
Yes, she is.
She's very nice.

48:01.612 --> 48:05.946
So like I said, I just want to cross
a couple ofT's, little stuff.

48:06.016 --> 48:10.009
It's all just part
of the process.

48:10.087 --> 48:13.352
By the way, sir, I was real impressed
with your graciousness...

48:13.423 --> 48:16.790
- On the whole Senator Hanson thing.
<i>- Oh? </i>

48:16.860 --> 48:19.158
<i>You know, in supporting her. </i>
<i>Real gracious. </i>

48:19.229 --> 48:23.632
Well, as you know, I withdrew my name
from consideration.

48:23.700 --> 48:25.361
<i>Right. Right. </i>

48:25.435 --> 48:29.303
And I think she's a real fine choice.
Anybody that knows her knows that.

48:29.373 --> 48:32.467
How long have you known her?

48:32.542 --> 48:36.706
- Oh, well, actually, I don't really...
<i>- I'm sorry. </i>

48:36.780 --> 48:38.975
When you said,
"Anybody that knows her"...

48:39.049 --> 48:42.212
<i>- I know people who know her. </i>
- Uh-huh.

48:42.286 --> 48:46.552
- I'm happy to give you
their names, if you'd like.
<i>- Great. </i>

48:46.623 --> 48:50.582
I don't really know her, but I've
seen her several times at functions...

48:50.661 --> 48:55.462
and, uh, I think
she'll do a real good job.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.534
Sir, can I just say that...

48:59.603 --> 49:02.470
I was really hoping
you'd go for the position...

49:02.539 --> 49:04.769
especially after what happened
on the Apachaway.

49:04.841 --> 49:06.866
I think people would think,
in the back of their minds...

49:06.944 --> 49:11.347
"This here's a guy who takes risks
when the right thing's at stake."

49:11.415 --> 49:15.044
- Lifesaver?
- No, thanks.

49:15.118 --> 49:19.214
Anyway, some real bad luck,
your being right there.

49:19.289 --> 49:21.689
Not if I'd been able
to save her.

49:21.758 --> 49:26.422
No, no, in the crabbing area.

49:26.496 --> 49:29.624
<i>It's just that</i>
<i>you were fishing for bass, so... </i>

49:29.700 --> 49:33.227
- That probably explains why
we didn't catch anything.
<i>-[Laughing]</i>

49:33.303 --> 49:38.741
You fish in the Apachaway
a lot, so I thought that
you would know that, but...

49:38.809 --> 49:40.902
I don't fish a lot.

49:40.978 --> 49:45.039
- I thought your equipment
was pretty sophisticated, but...
<i>- There's a difference... </i>

49:45.115 --> 49:47.583
between wanting to fish
and having time to fish.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.175
Tell me about it.

49:49.252 --> 49:54.121
<i>-And he freed the slaves</i>
<i>and won the Civil War. </i>
<i>- That's right! </i>

49:54.191 --> 49:56.182
<i>He was probably</i>
<i>our greatest president. </i>

49:56.259 --> 49:59.956
- Even greater than George Washington?
- It's a running debate.

50:00.030 --> 50:03.261
- Laine Hanson.
- Oh, Mr. President.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.893
And you must be
one Timothy Hanson.

50:05.969 --> 50:09.700
- Timothy Muskie Hanson.
- [Chuckles]

50:09.773 --> 50:13.834
Well, Timothy Muskie Hanson, how would
you like a great big cookie? Any kind.

50:13.910 --> 50:16.470
- No, thank you.
<i>-Any kind at all. </i>

50:16.546 --> 50:18.173
Oatmeal, white chocolate...

50:18.248 --> 50:20.773
Actually, we just had dinner,
but thanks.

50:20.851 --> 50:24.514
In that case, shall we have
our picture taken, young man? Hmm?

50:24.588 --> 50:28.786
- How do I look?
<i>- Your tie's a little crooked. </i>

50:28.859 --> 50:32.351
Well, can't take a picture like that.
Will you straighten it for me?

50:37.200 --> 50:41.466
Your mommy tells me you know more about
the presidents than most grown-ups.

50:41.538 --> 50:44.564
- I like to study them.
- Mmm! Me too.

50:44.641 --> 50:47.337
<i>I think we're ready</i>
<i>for business, Dennis. </i>

50:47.411 --> 50:50.744
- Sir.
- You must be very proud of your mom.

50:50.814 --> 50:54.614
Yeah, being the vice president
is better than being the president.

50:54.684 --> 50:56.948
Oh, I'm sure you're right.

50:57.020 --> 51:00.512
'Cause nobody wants to shoot
the vice president.

51:02.092 --> 51:06.290
So, you must be feeling
pretty excited about now. Please sit.

51:06.363 --> 51:09.161
- Hmm?
- Well, I think I'm a little nervous.

51:09.232 --> 51:12.497
Well, good! Good.
Night before a confirmation hearing.

51:12.569 --> 51:15.299
Anything else,
I would've withdrawn your name.

51:15.372 --> 51:18.569
- What about this Webster, sir?
- Ah, one second. Anybody here hungry?

51:18.642 --> 51:21.839
- No, thanks.
- No, sir, I'm not. Thanks.

51:21.912 --> 51:27.248
Otto, could you whip up some
Kung Pao chicken, but with walnuts?

51:27.317 --> 51:29.251
[Otto Over Intercom]
No problem, sir.

51:29.319 --> 51:33.449
Ah, the kid. Met him. You know
this young congressman, Webster?

51:33.523 --> 51:35.889
No, sir, I don't.

51:35.959 --> 51:40.919
No matter. He reminds me of me
when I was his age. That's bad.

51:42.799 --> 51:46.929
K, you need to put out word
that no matter what this kid does...

51:47.003 --> 51:49.267
nobody's to give him
a hard time.

51:49.339 --> 51:53.275
He's misguided, but he's got something.
And one day, who knows?

51:53.343 --> 51:57.871
All right, sir. I'm sure the senator
can handle Mr. Webster.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.939
<i>There is one concern</i>
<i>we need to... </i>

52:00.016 --> 52:03.577
<i>[Evans]</i>
<i>Oh, right, concern. Laine? </i>

52:03.653 --> 52:08.113
K told me about your little
sexual romp in college.

52:08.191 --> 52:11.422
Shit. Tomorrow is the 17 th.

52:11.495 --> 52:14.692
- Glenda?
<i>- [Woman] Yes, sir? </i>

52:14.764 --> 52:18.962
<i>Tomorrow is Jacobson's birthday. </i>
<i>Have you got something</i>
<i>for the son of a bitch? </i>

52:19.035 --> 52:21.469
Yes, sir. You got him
a leather-bound Don Quixote.

52:21.538 --> 52:24.405
Oh, good. Good gift.
Metaphorical gift.

52:24.474 --> 52:27.841
He'll be trying to figure out
why I got him that forever.

at the time?

52:30.213 --> 52:33.671
Uh, I was a freshman in...

52:33.750 --> 52:37.015
You know, sir, I'm just not going
to comment on the whole thing.

52:37.087 --> 52:39.146
It's beneath me
and it's beneath the press.

52:39.222 --> 52:41.747

<i>Senator Hanson does not kiss and tell. </i>

52:41.825 --> 52:46.694
<i>- It's perfect. </i>
- Maybe I was too rough
on Shelly in Hartford.

52:46.763 --> 52:51.632
Then this would all be moot,
'cause you wouldn't be president, sir.

52:51.701 --> 52:53.635
You know what?

52:53.703 --> 52:57.161
Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys,
the whole football team.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.470
Who the fuck cares?

52:59.543 --> 53:05.140
You just look those bastards
in the eye and tell them exactly that.

53:05.215 --> 53:07.206
These guys,
they're gonna confirm you.

53:07.284 --> 53:10.344
But they want to embarrass you
in the process.

53:10.420 --> 53:13.685
They want to send you into
this administration as a virus.

53:13.757 --> 53:15.691
So you have only one choice.

53:15.759 --> 53:20.355
- Yes, sir?
- Don't... be embarrassed.

53:27.137 --> 53:31.870
It is now up to us
to light the spark...

53:31.942 --> 53:35.309

so that we may have...

53:35.378 --> 53:40.077
a new birth
of national honesty...

53:40.150 --> 53:42.345
and decency.

53:42.419 --> 53:45.445
And sometimes in this process...

53:45.522 --> 53:48.650
you will question
even yourselves.

53:48.725 --> 53:51.751
And that's good,
that's healthy.

For what are we
if we are not what we believe?

53:56.967 --> 54:00.368
Laine Hanson...
is a cancer.

54:00.437 --> 54:03.702
<i>A cancer of liberalism. </i>

54:03.773 --> 54:06.503
A cancer of disloyalty.

54:06.576 --> 54:10.945
<i>Her nomination itself is the cancer</i>
<i>of affirmative action. </i>

54:12.716 --> 54:17.016
<i>What we will sing</i>

54:17.087 --> 54:22.389

Clausewitz said that war
is the natural extension of politics.

55:50.347 --> 55:53.316
It is my privilege
and my honor...

55:53.383 --> 55:56.875
to serve as the chairman
of these special hearings.

55:56.953 --> 56:00.946
We are here today for only
the third time in our history...

56:01.024 --> 56:03.788
to ensure the proper implementation
of the 25th amendment...

56:03.860 --> 56:06.090
and for the first time...

56:06.162 --> 56:10.360
the House has taken on
that responsibility.

56:10.433 --> 56:14.563
Myself and my esteemed

important matter be handled with...

56:20.276 --> 56:22.437
expedition and dignity.

56:22.512 --> 56:26.039
We are proud to welcome
our friend and colleague, Laine Hanson.

56:26.116 --> 56:29.677
<i>Madam Senator, </i>

<i>Mr. Chairman, point of order. </i>

56:51.174 --> 56:54.143
<i>The Chair recognizes</i>
<i>Mr. Webster of Delaware. </i>

56:54.210 --> 56:57.338
Mr. Chairman, I direct
your attention to page 16...

56:57.414 --> 57:01.612
<i>tab C-25 of the ledger, </i>
<i>a transcript of the Q-and-A session... </i>

57:01.684 --> 57:04.209
<i>between the nominee and several students</i>
<i>from Harvard University. </i>

57:04.287 --> 57:08.656
<i>- Page 16? </i>
<i>- Page 16 at the bottom of the page. </i>

57:08.725 --> 57:11.285
<i>You'll see the following remarks</i>
<i>in reference to a question... </i>

57:11.361 --> 57:13.591
regarding the separation
of church and state.

57:13.663 --> 57:16.131
The nominee said, and I quote,
"The separation exists...

57:16.199 --> 57:18.861
because we cannot have a fairy tale
govern a nation."

57:18.935 --> 57:21.665
What, sir, is the point?

57:21.738 --> 57:24.400
The senator just swore an oath
to an entity she does not believe in.

57:24.474 --> 57:28.308
<i>Madam Senator, </i>
<i>you understand... </i>

57:28.378 --> 57:31.472
that you have promised
to be truthful to this committee?

57:31.548 --> 57:36.315
<i>-And that lying to this body</i>
<i>is perjury, punishable by law? </i>
- Yes, I do understand that.

57:37.954 --> 57:40.923
Well, I think
we're all agreed...

57:40.990 --> 57:45.859
that even though the senator
has shown a disdain...

57:45.929 --> 57:48.489
for religion
and those practicing it...

57:48.565 --> 57:51.363
which is her constitutional right...

57:51.434 --> 57:54.096
<i>that does not necessarily, </i>
<i>Mr. Webster, make her a liar. </i>

57:54.170 --> 57:57.367
I'm confident we can proceed.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.635
<i>- Madam? </i>
- Yes?

57:59.709 --> 58:02.576
<i>For the record, would you</i>
<i>state your name and address? </i>

58:02.645 --> 58:04.237
Yes. My name is Laine Hanson.

That's till recently, of course.

in different directions.

At least you have your life.
There's nothing sinister going on here.

58:26.336 --> 58:28.270
At this point,
we just need...

58:28.338 --> 58:32.035
to look at every aspect of her life
and find everyone that knew her.

58:32.108 --> 58:34.167
You never know
what you're gonna find.

58:34.244 --> 58:37.145
- Did you find anything?
- No, no, not really.

58:37.213 --> 58:39.044
Not really?
You mean...

58:39.115 --> 58:41.049
A little bit, actually.

58:41.117 --> 58:44.052
I did speak to other classmates,
and they told me she was pretty wild.

58:44.120 --> 58:46.054
Wild? Yeah, she was wild.

58:46.122 --> 58:48.852
Wild enough you can be sure the tabloids
are gonna have a field day.

58:48.925 --> 58:50.790
Have you spoken to them?

58:50.860 --> 58:54.626
Um, me? No.
But somebody somewhere's gonna talk.

58:54.697 --> 58:58.633
- But not you.
- Uh-uh, no.

58:58.701 --> 59:02.296
- It's okay if you have.
We're not gonna lock you up.
- No, I haven't.

maybe, the <i>National Enquirer... </i>

59:08.845 --> 59:11.712
or one of those
silly television programs...

59:11.781 --> 59:14.511
- That show, um <i>... Access... </i>
<i>- Confidential? </i>

59:14.584 --> 59:17.553
No, no, no.
I don't know anything.

59:17.620 --> 59:19.986
The last time I talked to her it
was just, "The kid this, the kid that."

59:20.056 --> 59:25.926
According to our records,
you spoke to her on the 15th.

59:25.995 --> 59:28.054

59:33.136 --> 59:35.366
Oh, is that right? Vegas?

59:35.438 --> 59:38.339
She asked me to go along with her.
It was gonna be her treat.

59:38.408 --> 59:40.342
I couldn't go
because I had to work.

59:40.410 --> 59:44.676
We were gonna stay at one of those
ritzy new places. The, um, Bellage...?

59:44.747 --> 59:47.614

- Yeah.

59:47.684 --> 59:50.585
- With the contortionist.
- I've never been.

59:56.492 --> 59:59.154
You've been going through my desk.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.169
<i>It never crossed my mind</i>
<i>when I was a younger woman... </i>

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.934
<i>that I'd be this age</i>
<i>and not have kids. </i>

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:14.841
Somehow in my mind, kids.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:17.744
Raising them,
making them good people.

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:20.009
That's what I wanted.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.711

<i>so we could do good. </i>

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:45.934
<i>It was then that I realized that all</i>
<i>of our sacrifices were not in vain... </i>

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:49.069

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:06.991

<i>- Yes, I do. </i>

That was an issue of fairness.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:19.584

I am opposed to making adultery,

it should be enforced

<i>even if that rank</i>
<i>is commander in chief. </i>

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:46.681
Perhaps the senator is unaware
that commander in chief
is not actually a military rank.

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.689
<i>I am aware of that. </i>

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:54.593

- We're gonna get back into this?
- We will. We will.

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:27.749
Senator, you want me to sit in?
Make sure the congressman's
clear on everything?

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:31.520
<i>We'll be fine. Won't we, Mr. Webster? </i>
<i>We'll be all right. Thanks. </i>

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:35.726
Proud of yourself?

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.330
So, what can I do for you,
Mr. Webster?

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:47.307
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm here.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:50.004
I think you're here because you want
to know why I'm not fighting back.

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:54.640
<i>Because despite it all, you've got</i>
<i>some odd sense of fair play. </i>

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:58.550
You're kicking my ass.
It's gone from feeling like
easy pickings to out-and-out bullying.

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.350
I feel like there should be
some back and forth between us,
you and the committee.

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:04.915
<i>I'll give you back and forth on Social</i>
<i>Security, relations with Israel... </i>

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:09.760
on the Dow Jones, the census,
almost everything, but not this.

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:13.892
No, not my personal life.
It's just nobody's business.

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.995
That's not what the people
will tell you; the people will
tell you it is their business...

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.905
that you're setting standards
of morality for their children.

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:22.205
Especially their girls.

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:24.245
Have you ever heard
of Isaac Lamm?

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:28.750
- Isaac Lamm? No.
<i>- He was the first one</i>
<i>to come before HUAC... </i>

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:31.012
the House Un-American
Activities Committee.

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:35.420
He was also the first one to name names,
first to cooperate with the government.

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.458
The dominoes fell from there.

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:40.154
<i>Careers crushed, </i>
<i>families destroyed. </i>

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:44.995
Just imagine, Mr. Webster,
if Mr. Lamm had just said,
"Fuck you," to the committee.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.160
Imagine how much harder
he would've made it for them.

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:51.695
Are you accusing the committee
of sexual McCarthyism?

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:55.675
Well, it's not necessary
to make the accusation.

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:59.544
Oh, I just can't respond
to the committee's lightly
veiled accusations...

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.845
because it's not okay
for them to be made.

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:06.718
Or maybe you can't respond
because the answers you have
to give are too embarrassing.

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.058
You know what?

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.059
You're young.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.095
That's okay. That's okay.
You're young.

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:19.361
I'm gonna choose to be amused
by your naïïveté, give you
the benefit of the doubt.

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.959
I'm gonna spell it out
for you even more clearly.

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:24.130
If I were a man,
nobody would care...

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:26.606
how many sexual partners
I had in college.

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:31.169
<i>And if it's not relevant for a man, </i>
<i>it's not relevant for a woman. </i>

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:37.281
Jerry, send the folks back in, please.
I gotta finish this up.

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:40.378
<i>[Mrs. Runyon]</i>
<i>He's not a bad man. </i>

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.753
<i>He believes in what he's doing. </i>

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:45.258
<i>There's an odd sort</i>
<i>of integrity there. </i>

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.261
<i>But in this business, </i>
<i>with so much at stake... </i>

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:51.993
it's not enough to believe
in yourself, you have to be right.

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:57.095
This is an ideological rape
of all women.

01:17:57.172 --> 01:18:00.266
- Timmy, that's a little too high.
- Okay, Mommy.

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:03.243
Thank you, sweetie.

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:07.509
Well, then I'll survive it
for all of us.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:11.985
<i>Tomorrow morning Congressman Marshall</i>
<i>is gonna ask you questions. </i>

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:14.045
He's going to hit you
with abortion.

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:17.751
I promise you that Shelly will find
some way to call you a baby killer.

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:21.956
<i>We're ready for him. </i>
<i>Our position papers are first-rate. </i>

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:24.726
<i>- Every one of them. </i>
<i>- You let him finish. </i>

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.567
Then you look him in the eye
and you ask him...

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:33.335
"Mr. Runyon, 20 years ago
your wife Maggie had an abortion.

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.501
Do you think her a murderer?"

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:40.614
<i>He's a hypocrite. </i>

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:44.049
No, he's not.
Shelly has no idea.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:49.056
Are you saying you would appoint
a Supreme Court justice...

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:52.287
<i>based on his being pro-choice? </i>

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.729
Mr. Marshall, the vice president
does not appoint Supreme Court justices.

01:18:56.798 --> 01:19:00.791
Should you succeed the president
or even advise the president?

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:03.861
I would be inclined,
though not without flexibility...

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:07.807
to disregard any man or woman who is
pro-life from serving on the High Court.

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:12.973
So you would allow a personal political
belief to enter into such a decision?

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:15.744
Abortion isn't
a constitutional issue.

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:18.285
The fine ladies and gentlemen
who serve on the Supreme Court...

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:20.287
which is now stacked
with right-wing appointees...

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:25.122
have no business deciding whether women
have to resort to back-alley abortions...

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:29.186
You mean they have no business
deciding whether women have
a license to commit murder.

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:31.562
<i>[Runyon]</i>
<i>Mr. Marshall, your time has expired. </i>

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:36.935
Sir, if the distinguished "gentlelady"
from Ohio would answer the question...

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:39.599
<i>I think the lady has made clear</i>
<i>her propensity for abortion. </i>

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:45.135
- Come on, Mr. Runyon!
<i>- Mr. Lewis, you do not</i>
<i>have speaking privileges. </i>

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:48.307
Mr. Chairman, I find your term,
"propensity for abortion"...

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:50.351
misrepresentative of my position.

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:53.876
I have a propensity
for a woman's right to choose.

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:57.083
<i>- To abort a child! </i>
<i>-A fetus. </i>

01:19:57.159 --> 01:20:01.596
To kill a baby
as it grows in the womb.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.998
Personally, Senator...

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:11.232
I do not believe that it is
the right of our citizens...

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:16.243
to... to butcher
a defenseless human being simply...

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:19.906
simply as a matter of choice.

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:23.576
At the risk of my own future,
I tell you this:

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.813
If you support the right...

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:29.653
<i>of a woman to choose, </i>
<i>you are supporting... </i>

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:34.661
nothing less than
a-a-a holocaust of the unborn.

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:38.324
Mr. Chairman,
are you calling me...

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:06.822
I believe my position
on this issue is clear.

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:11.661
Yes, madam,
it most certainly is.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.868
God, I love this game.
[Chuckles]

01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:20.305
[Coughing]

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:23.401
When she tries to tell me
how to do it, I do it my way.

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:27.574
Then she comes back and changes it
afterwards, and that way...

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:31.050
Jeez.
[Coughing]

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.585
Good one, sir.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:38.649
You're an all-weather golfer,
I see.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.661
What kind of stick
you using there?

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.755
- It's a putting stick.
- Right, putting stick.

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:46.824
When I asked for you last week,
they said you were in Vegas.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.700
- Business, sir.
- Vegas is business?

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:52.740
I did blow
a roll of quarters.

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.741
Will you excuse us?

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:06.319
- How's that cough doing?
- Aah.

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:11.382
That's her casino account balance.

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:15.919
She offered to take her sorority sister
to Vegas, her treat.

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:24.232
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you God?

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:26.274
I do.

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:31.904
<i>Please state your name</i>
<i>for the record. </i>

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:36.383
Cynthia C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N Lee.

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:39.852
<i>Thank you. </i>
<i>Please be seated. </i>

01:22:41.423 --> 01:22:47.191
<i>We will start the questioning</i>
<i>with Mr. Skakle. </i>

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:50.595
<i>Mr. Skakle, the five-minute rule</i>
<i>is in effect. </i>

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:53.429
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </i>

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:56.061
<i>Miss Lee. </i>

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:59.937
Miss Lee, hello. I'm over here.
Thank you for joining us.

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:03.705
Now, you are under subpoena,
is that correct?

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:05.837
Yes.

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:10.044
<i>- Miss Lee, could you speak</i>
<i>directly into the mike? </i>
- Yes.

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:13.417
<i>I understand you're nervous, but believe</i>
<i>me when I tell you you're among friends. </i>

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:17.421
<i>Miss Lee, you are not married. </i>

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:20.086
No... No.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:22.857
- No, I'm not.
<i>- But you once were. </i>

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:25.593
I was married
to William Hanson.

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.932
- Who is now married to the nominee.
<i>- Yes. </i>

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:33.338
He married Laine after our divorce.
It was about seven years ago.

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:36.275
<i>Divorce. Right. </i>
<i>I've read your divorce papers. </i>

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:40.781
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, </i>
<i>that by the way is tab 76.</i>

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.682
<i>They cite</i>
<i>irreconcilable differences. </i>

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:48.155
<i>Could you tell us, what were</i>
<i>those irreconcilable differences? </i>

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:50.123
I can't really pinpoint them.

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:54.150
<i>- Was your husband</i>
<i>physically violent to you? </i>
- No.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:58.495
<i>Did you have financial</i>
<i>disagreements or disagreements</i>
<i>over how to raise your kids? </i>

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:00.534
We didn't have children.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:05.096
<i>- Were there infidelities? </i>
- Yes. There was one.

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:08.939
<i>Is it safe to say that this infidelity</i>
<i>precipitated the divorce? </i>

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:16.445
Miss Lee, please answer
the question verbally. Was that a yes?

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:19.646
Yes, it was.
It was a yes.

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:22.656
<i>- Did you, ma'am, have the affair? </i>
- No.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:25.352
- It was your husband then?
- Yes.

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:28.726
Will...
Will was in charge...

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:33.461
<i>of Laine Billings's</i>
<i>first senatorial campaign. </i>

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.560
He was with her all the time.

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:39.368
Are you suggesting the senator,
the nominee, had an affair
with your husband?

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:44.671
- Once again, Miss Lee...
- I'm sorry. Yes. Yes, yes.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.680
<i>Thank you. </i>

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.978
Did the nominee know
Mr. Hanson was married?

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:54.050
Laine was my friend.
My good, good friend.

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:57.182
<i>Miss Lee, would you explain</i>
<i>to this committee as you</i>
<i>did in your deposition... </i>

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:01.820
<i>how you discovered</i>
<i>that the nominee was involved... </i>

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:04.262
in an affair
with your husband?

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:07.597
Yes. Um...

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:11.105
On the night of the elections,
I was at home.

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.436
I had the flu.

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:18.536
I was watching TV, watching Laine
about to make her acceptance speech.

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:23.245
I was very sad
that I couldn't be there.

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:27.015
It was a triumph
for Laine and my husband.

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:31.024
<i>She was up at the podium. </i>
<i>Will was by her side. </i>

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:33.583
<i>He was holding her hand</i>
<i>in victory. </i>

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:36.255
<i>On the other side</i>
<i>of Laine... </i>

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:39.732
<i>she was just sort of clasping</i>
<i>that person's hand. </i>

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:43.237
<i>But with Will... </i>

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:45.966
their hands were interlaced.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.339
It was odd
that I noticed it, but...

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:52.311
Um, my doorbell rang.

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.474
I answered the door,
and there was a gentleman there...

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:59.646
dressed very nicely,
he had a yellow tie on.

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:01.951
He had papers for me.

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:05.049
<i>- Papers? I'm sorry. </i>
- Separation papers.

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:09.825
<i>Since the committee</i>
<i>chose to humiliate a private woman</i>
<i>in the most public possible setting... </i>

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:12.696
I would like to apologize
to her alike...

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:16.498
and I will also do so privately
when she allows me to do so.

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:20.940
Um, what I did to Miss Lee
was wrong.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:23.876
It was not done out of malice.
Indeed the opposite.

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:26.971
Um...

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:31.451
Iove is an involuntary reflex,
and I fell victim to it.

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:35.751
Um, I deeply regret
causing Cynthia pain...

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:39.782
and it is especially saddening
for me because...

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:43.319
of how close we once were.

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:47.494
And whether or not the affair
that Will and I had...

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:50.333
should have any bearing on my assuming
office is for the committee to decide.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:55.342
I dare not assume that I have
the objective wisdom to make
that determination. Thank you.

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:58.902
- Senator,
are you suggesting the public...
- Okay, she's had a long day.

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.216
You know what she's going through.
Come on, come on.

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.376
You know what she's going through.
Come on, come on.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.543
She was your best friend.

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:08.988
<i>Runyon deposed Will's</i>
<i>ex-wife today, and, uh... </i>

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.525
she stated that Will and I
had had an affair...

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:14.926
She saw her fucking holding hands,
interlocked fingers with this gal...

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.930
and she knew
that she'd been fucking him.

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:18.989
That's what she said.

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.535
<i>- I'm sorry. </i>
<i>-[Newman] It's a bad beat. </i>

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:26.597
I'm not sure that I get
the point of all this.

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:30.508
- You said under oath
that you never committed adultery.
- That's right.

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:34.036
<i>- You perjured yourself. </i>
- I didn't commit adultery.

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:35.878
- You were fucking Will
when he was married.
- All right.

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:40.046
<i>Even the most loose definition</i>
<i>of committing adultery</i>
<i>would not include that. </i>

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:42.589
Goddamn it, she's right.
You're right.

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:46.388
<i>In order for it to be</i>
<i>committing adultery, she'd have</i>
<i>to be married at the time. </i>

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.395
<i>You're nitpicking</i>
<i>in reverse now. </i>

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:50.658
<i>Your husband may have been</i>
<i>an adulterer. You're not. Fine. </i>

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:55.601
What you are is a sex-crazed,
home-wrecking machine.
The female Warren Beatty.

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:59.071
Runyon knows
that you're clean of the perjury...

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:03.133
but he's got the world thinking you're
something out of a bad soap opera.

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:08.171
You've goddamned crystallized
the difference between being
guilty and being responsible.

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:10.376
Are you asking me
to step down, sir?

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:14.911
No, it's not gonna be
that easy for you, and it's not
gonna be that easy for them.

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:20.788
They caught you being
a human being. That's all.

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:25.227
I'll die before Shelly Runyon
checkmates me.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.066
<i>I think the president's trying to say</i>
<i>the Sitting Bull routine isn't working. </i>

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:32.573
- The Sitting Bull routine?
- No!

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:38.678
Fight back.

01:28:38.746 --> 01:28:42.910
Show them Laine Hanson isn't gonna take
their shit. Take the fight out of'em.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.815
- What's the process?
- Confess.

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:47.650
- Confess?
<i>- Yeah, confess. </i>
- Confess.

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:50.316
Confess to the gang-bang.
Confess to all of it.

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:54.054
<i>-[Evans] Look what it did</i>
<i>for Clinton with Flowers. </i>
<i>- Play it any way you want. </i>

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.993
It didn't hurt his numbers.
It improved his numbers.

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:59.500
Show indignation about how a man
would never have to go through
hell for having done this.

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:02.092
<i>Confess and demonstrate</i>
<i>to the young women of America... </i>

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:07.574
<i>how such sexual impropriety</i>
<i>can ruin their lives. </i>

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:12.636
Confess and preach about the dangers
that alcohol can bring to you.

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:14.875
For God's sakes, just confess!

01:29:14.949 --> 01:29:18.908
I understand, Kermit, truly.

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:23.480
I understand, and you know what?
It's really nobody's business.

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:27.392
<i>Well, it is</i>
<i>our fucking business! </i>

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:41.141
Listen, Laine...

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.906
I don't care who you fucked...

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:48.312
and how many times
in how many positions...

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:51.614
as long as it doesn't threaten
the administration.

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:57.520
<i>You can be cavalier</i>
<i>on your own dime. </i>

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:09.336
Mr. President.

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:13.873
[Sighs]

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:21.246
I am fully prepared
to step down...

01:30:21.315 --> 01:30:24.250
but my personal life...

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:28.118
and my past...

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:31.484
are just that.

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:35.359
But I will do
whatever you say.

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:45.128
Show them why Laine Hanson is my nominee
with your closing statement.

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.436
Mr. Chairman...

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:50.841
ladies and gentlemen
of the committee:

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:55.542
Uh, remarkably enough, it seems
that I have some explaining to do.

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:59.484
So...
let me be absolutely clear.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.194
I stand for a woman's right
to choose.

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:14.325
I stand for the elimination
of the death penalty.

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:17.428
I stand for a strong
and growing armed forces...

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:21.498
because we must stomp out genocide
on this planet...

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:25.239
and I believe that that
is a cause worth dying for.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:31.411
I stand for seeing every gun
taken out of every home. Period.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:36.514
I stand for making
the selling of cigarettes
to our youth a federal offense.

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:41.756
I stand for term limits
and campaign reform.

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:46.562
And, Mr. Chairman, I stand for
the separation of church and state...

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:51.503
and the reason that I stand
for that is the same reason that
I believe our forefathers did.

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:54.871
It is not there to protect religion
from the grasp of government...

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:59.311
but to protect our government
from the grasp of religious fanaticism.

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.974
I may be an atheist...

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:06.383
but that does not mean I do not
go to church; I do go to church.

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:09.981
The church I go to is the one
that emancipated the slaves...

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:12.525
that gave women
the right to vote.

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:17.826
It gave us every freedom
that we hold dear.

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:21.665
My church is this very chapel
of democracy that we sit in together...

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:24.899
and I do not need God to tell me
what are my moral absolutes.

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:27.270
I need my heart,
my brain and this church.

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:35.841
Get in there, get in there.

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:41.013
Oh, shoot!
Come on, come on, come on!

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:44.888
- Senator? Oh...
- Hello, Freshman.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:47.257
Senator, I just wanted
to steal a couple of seconds.

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:50.491
What? See what whores do
on their time off?

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:57.369
Listen,
I know the things I've done.

01:32:57.438 --> 01:33:00.566
They may not have been nice
or considered politically savvy...

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:04.737
but they have served the greater good
and they have been honest.

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:06.575
[Chuckles]
Okay.

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:09.275
Look, I know
you're not a whore.

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:11.614
- I'm not gonna talk about it.
<i>- I know. You're not talking about it. </i>

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:16.353
Somebody else
has come forward.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:19.689
Somebody else from the night
of the incident sent me this letter.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.694
<i>They didn't send it to me. </i>
<i>They sent it to the committee. </i>

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:24.287
<i>I just happen to be in charge</i>
<i>of all the correspondence. </i>

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:28.062
I don't think you can keep quiet
about what's in there.

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:32.538
Mr. Runyon has a copy,
and now so do you.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:35.872
<i>I beg you, Senator, </i>
<i>to deal with this. </i>

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:41.108
- How long is this flight?
- About an hour and 40 minutes.

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:45.346
POTUS is scheduled to address
the American Legion on the third.

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:48.183
- American Legion? Who approved that?
<i>- I don't know. </i>

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:50.883
- I thought he had
the D.A.R. dinner that night.
- We have a five-hour window.

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.721
- Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, Kermit.

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.727
Did you get the AP reports?

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:59.528
- What's that?
- POTUS's poll numbers are down 23%.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.468
- And Hanson's in the low 30s.
- Get in there.
I'll talk to you in a minute.

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:06.438
- Are you Willomina?
- Yes, sir.

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:10.143
You asked to see me?

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:13.510
- Is this your handiwork?
- Yes, sir.

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:17.677
- How many people have seen this?
- I gave it only to the director.

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:21.483
- And who have you talked to about this?
- Nobody.

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:24.319
Not a husband? Boyfriend?

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:28.590
- Grandma in Kalamazoo?
- No, sir. Nobody.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:32.121
- Keep it that way.
<i>- Yes, sir. </i>

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:35.032
You did a good job,
Special Agent.

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:43.375
Sir! Uh, sir, I just... I just wanted
to ask, ask you. Um, well...

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:46.174
Are you gonna dump her?

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:49.114
<i>Sir, this may be really, </i>
<i>really inappropriate... </i>

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.845
but if that's what you guys
are thinking...

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:55.548
<i>Please, you can't do it. </i>
<i>She's hope. </i>

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:59.320
Hope that the standards...
That there is no double standard.

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:01.987
Hope that the goals
can be the same.

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:06.365
You know what?
You're goddamn right.

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:10.734
That was absolutely inappropriate.

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:13.137
Robertson.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.880
<i>[Runyon]</i>
<i>I wouldn't take it too hard. </i>

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:31.049
<i>It's not exactly fair</i>
<i>when six foxes and one chicken... </i>

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:33.889
<i>are voting on</i>
<i>what to have for dinner. </i>

01:35:33.961 --> 01:35:37.863
<i>[Evans] Well, that's not</i>
<i>playing fair. I'll give you that. </i>

01:35:37.932 --> 01:35:40.162
<i>You want an oatmeal cookie? </i>

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:41.895
- Trevor?
<i>- I'm getting them, sir. </i>

01:35:41.969 --> 01:35:46.269
<i>I find these giant raisins... </i>
<i>Well, you'll see. </i>

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.433
Taste like grapes.

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:58.443
Shelly, you really made
a mess of things for me.

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:00.851
You sure did clobber me.

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:08.719
Isn't it possible, sir,
that I was... that I was acting...

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:11.128
- In the best interests
of the United States?
<i>- No. </i>

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:13.632
It's not possible.

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:17.102
That's what pisses me off. It's all
about retribution for Hartford.

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:19.662
Thank you, Trevor.
That'll be all.

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:23.836
- Go ahead. Try this. It's wonderful.
- No.

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:28.280
I may have taken the presidency
from you, but you one-upped me.

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:31.409
You took away my legacy.

01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:34.818
I look at her and I see someone who
has proven the capacity for disloyalty.

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.880
Or the capacity
for seeing the light.

01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:41.120
We're both sticking
to our guns.

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:44.255
The difference is...
mine are loaded.

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:49.633
<i>Look, it doesn't matter, does it? </i>
<i>She's not being confirmed. </i>

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:53.833
We can talk for days
about greatness and leadership...

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:56.433
<i>but Laine Hanson</i>
<i>will not be confirmed. </i>

01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:59.911
I have seven from your side
who are giving her the ax.

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:01.948
Oh, indeed, the ax?

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:03.950
<i>We can go through</i>
<i>the process of a vote. </i>

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:05.610
<i>You can waste time... </i>

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:10.453
and suffer the humiliation,
or... or we can just move on.

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:12.583
- There's a lot of good folk
to choose from.
<i>- Who? </i>

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.924
Who can I be certain
you'll confirm?

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:19.125
The man you wanted in the first place:
Jack Hathaway.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.269
Shelly.

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:26.840
<i>Good man. </i>

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:40.678
Okay, Shelly...

01:37:40.754 --> 01:37:45.782
I'll give you GovernorJack Hathaway,
but I wanna make damn sure...

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:49.227
<i>-you'll give him a smooth ride. </i>
- My word. There's a reason
they call me Honest Shell.

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:53.232
Irony, Shelly.
I want an insurance policy.

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.201
I want a piece of the rock.
I wanna make sure...

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:58.568
<i>you're not gonna pull</i>
<i>some kind of baloney out of your hat... </i>

01:37:58.639 --> 01:38:00.903
<i>and make a mockery</i>
<i>of my administration again. </i>

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:03.466
<i>Listen. This is</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do. </i>

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:10.442
I'm gonna ask Mrs. Hanson and
Mr. Hathaway up to the Oval Office...

01:38:10.517 --> 01:38:13.111
before the D.A.R. banquet
tomorrow night.

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:15.382
<i>I want you there as well, </i>
<i>but, Shelly... </i>

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:19.483
before then, I need you
to marry yourself to this guy.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:23.860
<i>I need you to make a public statement</i>
<i>that makes his sinking your sinking. </i>

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:26.491
<i>- Otherwise... </i>
- But I'm not sure I can...

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:29.934
Let's make this confirmation
fast and furious.

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:32.871
- Help me save face on this one.
- Okay.

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:50.881
<i>Oh, man. Mr. Runyon, </i>
<i>prefer I take you around back? </i>

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:54.894
- No, I'll be fine.
<i>- Yes, sir. </i>

01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:10.738
How do you respond to the rumors
that Mrs. Hanson has withdrawn her name?

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:12.802
That is a rumor
I've not yet heard.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.280
Have you heard about the possibility
of Governor Hathaway...

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:18.978
- Returning to the list
of vice presidential...
- Governor Hathaway is a fine man.

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:21.385
<i>Will he have a smoother ride</i>
<i>than Mrs. Hanson? </i>

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:23.980
Let me go on record
as saying...

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:27.755
that in my opinion there is
no man alive... no Democrat alive...

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:30.661
who could bring...

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:34.531
more integrity
to the office of the vice presidency.

01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:38.059
I would stake my career...

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:42.802
on Governor Hathaway's, uh,
smooth and efficient confirmation.

01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:45.811
<i>[Runyon]</i>
<i>As for Laine Hanson... </i>

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:49.474
- Got everybody, Glenda?
<i>- Yes, sir. He says you can</i>
<i>go in whenever you're ready. </i>

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:51.780
- Great. Hello, Jack.
- Kermit.

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:55.720
- Fiona, you're looking
particularly fetching this evening.
- Thank you, sir.

01:39:55.789 --> 01:39:59.350
- I believe this is the first one
of these affairs for you, right?
- Yes.

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:02.088
- My 37 th.
- You look great.

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.960
- Hello, Shelly.
- Newman.

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:09.765
Everybody would understand if you
wanted to delay for two weeks.

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:13.170
I'm not sure I could stomach
another two weeks.

01:40:14.241 --> 01:40:17.301
Oh, Jack.

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:21.075
- Jerry. Good.
- How are you?

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:23.207
Mr. Hanson.

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:27.443
<i>-[Evans] Gentlemen. Jack. </i>
<i>- Mr. President. </i>

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:29.648
There he is! Shelly!

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:31.918
Hello, Mr. President.

01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:34.017
Uh, you know what?

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:36.688
Before we get started...

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:39.164
I can't stomach the idea...

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:42.225
of touching that chichi food we always
get served at these state dinners.

01:40:42.302 --> 01:40:44.236
- Glenda?
<i>- Yes, sir? </i>

01:40:44.304 --> 01:40:47.398
<i>Could we put together a grilled</i>
<i>cheese sandwich? Muenster on rye. </i>

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:49.533
<i>Right away. </i>

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.908
Oh, sorry. Where are my manners?
You guys want anything?

01:40:51.979 --> 01:40:54.675
- No, thank you, sir.
- Shelly?

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.841
<i>Jesus, uh, Shell, </i>
<i>those were some... </i>

01:40:56.917 --> 01:41:00.512
very nice things
you said aboutJack.

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:06.585
Jack, there. I understand
that you two have never met.

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.390
<i>- Laine Hanson, Jack Hathaway. </i>
- It's a pleasure.

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:11.397
- I'm quite in awe of you.
- Thank you.

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:15.662
<i>[Glenda]</i>
<i>Mr. President? </i>

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:20.264
- Yes, Glenda?
<i>-Sir, the kitchen's</i>
<i>all out of Muenster. </i>

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:24.538
Really? Wow.
Well, um, let's get on that.

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:28.012
<i>We don't want the wheels</i>
<i>coming off the wagon. </i>

01:41:35.989 --> 01:41:39.686
This is, uh...

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.527
This is quite an event.
Here we are. Quite a sad event.

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:46.589
- Mr. President, if I may?
- Yes, please.

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:50.467
A short while ago,
you told me that you thought
I might be the future of the party.

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:53.631
<i>I know that these</i>
<i>are tough times... </i>

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:55.641
and the future is uncertain...

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:59.406
but I'm very pleased to think
that I might be able to help
make things a little smoother.

01:42:01.381 --> 01:42:05.909
The future, yes.
Well, there is one thing...

01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:09.752
quite certain
about the future.

01:42:11.325 --> 01:42:14.123
- What's that?
- [Coughs] Sir?

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:16.594
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Fred.

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:21.066
- I have to read him his rights.
- Fred, the governor,
he knows his rights.

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:25.094
You know your rights, right, Jack?
You don't have to humiliate him.

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:27.640
You fucked up, buddy.

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:32.008
<i>- The girl, do you know what she was? </i>
- What girl?

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:35.139
- The girl in the river.
- She was a paralegal.

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:38.651
- Before that.
- She was military. Fourteen Golf.

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:43.179
<i>We found the money that you put</i>
<i>in her account at the Bellagio. </i>

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:46.420
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- And that ad in...

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:48.927
- Soldier of Fortune.
<i>- Yeah, </i> Soldier of Fortune.

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:51.430
I don't mind confessing,
I am at a total fucking loss.

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:55.764
Shelly, he paid her
to go off the fucking bridge.

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:59.203
<i>He paid her to save her. </i>

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:01.207
Jesus Christ.

01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:06.345
- Shelly, maybe l...
- You shouldn't say anything.

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:11.214
- Jack, look, we respect...
<i>- You're going to have</i>
<i>to come with me now. </i>

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:13.549
Fred. We respect you.

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:16.612
We're trying to make this go
as smoothly as it possibly can.

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.920
I know you meant no harm.

01:43:18.992 --> 01:43:22.325
- Hell, I don't even know...
What would the charge be?
- Negligent homicide.

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:26.833
Oh, negligent homicide.

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.891
Sir.

01:43:30.404 --> 01:43:32.872
- Good luck, Mrs. Hanson.
- You too.

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:36.205
Who doesn't want
a shortcut to greatness?

01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:54.719
Oh, it's a goddamn shame
about the Muenster.

01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:07.373
Mr. President.

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:09.705
<i>Yeah, Shelly? </i>

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.937
You set me up.

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:13.946
Just this once.

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:20.451
For the record, sir...

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:24.786
I find what you did
to be manipulative...

01:44:24.858 --> 01:44:28.021
Mr. Chairman, let's just say...

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:31.258
"I'm guilty
but not responsible," hmm?

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:37.434
<i>Shelly, you needn't worry</i>
<i>about us exposing the fact... </i>

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:40.029
<i>that you leaked all that horrible</i>
<i>material about Laine on the Internet. </i>

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:44.976
We know that you were
just following your heart.

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:48.140
Yeah, Hartford,
it was a tough one.

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:50.376
But... Well, it doesn't
make a difference.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:54.284
- She still is who she is.
- Yes, she is.

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:56.822
<i>And you are who you are. </i>

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:01.418
You're still coming
to the banquet, aren't you?

01:45:01.495 --> 01:45:04.328
Because I'd love to see you.
Is your wife in town?

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:11.462
May I introduce
tonight's honoree, Miss Barr?

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:14.405
- Congressman Webster.
- Honor, madam.

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:17.773
And, Congressman,
you know the senator, of course.

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:20.506
We go about two feet back.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:23.743
I asked them to have you seated
at my table tonight.

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:27.878
- If you want to break bread with me.
- Absolutely.

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:30.684
- Don't eat all the hors d'oeuvres.
- Shark steak sandwiches?

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.918
Yeah. Save me some.

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:40.294
Last time I shared one of these,
it was with the president of Russia.

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:45.566
Or maybe it was the kid
who won Wimbledon for the second time.

01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:47.664
I'm honored, sir.

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:49.834
[Coughing]

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:53.004
You're not supposed to inhale.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:56.345
Maybe that's the first thing
you should've told me.

01:45:58.518 --> 01:46:01.248
Recognize this affidavit?

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:03.346
Where'd you get that, sir?

01:46:03.423 --> 01:46:05.948
Where you got yours.

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:08.859
Where Shelly Runyon got his.

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:11.591
From Mr. Webster.

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:15.426
He may not know
his right from his left...

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:18.528
but apparently
he does know right from wrong.

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:22.372
I understand you
even less now, Senator.

01:46:22.442 --> 01:46:25.809
- You are an enigma wrapped in a riddle.
- Wrapped in a riddle.

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:29.144
Watch your step, Senator.

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:37.722
What if I told you that I'm just
busting at the seams...

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:41.557
to know what exactly
happened that night...

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:45.257
to hear the truth
from your own lips?

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:48.563
Totally off the record.

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:54.130
Not between the president
and the senator, but between
the president and Laine.

01:46:54.207 --> 01:46:57.938
Better than that.
Between Jackson and Laine.

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:14.383
Well, I had just turned 18
when I got to college...

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:17.555
and I had never been
away from home, not really.

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:23.263
And I was immediately...
I was immediately lonely.

01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:26.999
And that's when
the sorority kicked in.

01:47:27.073 --> 01:47:29.098
I wanted them,
they wanted me.

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:31.440
I was the daughter of the governor,
for chrissake.

01:47:31.511 --> 01:47:34.810
- True blue catch.
- I guess so.

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:39.784
And like any other sorority,
they have an initiation, a rush.

01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:45.120
And they have this girl, this woman
that Runyon deposed, Patty LaVamere.

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:47.490
She runs the sorority,
and she gives it to me straight:

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:53.466
If I wanna be in, I have to go to
their brother fraternity and have sex...

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:56.525
with two boys.

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:58.662
What a coup for them, huh?

01:47:58.738 --> 01:48:02.401
Daughter of a big-time Republican
doing a frat house?

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:05.445
But I say,
"There's no chance."

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:08.413
- The whole thing was pretty hairy.
- I bet.

01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:11.576
But six beers later,
I'm talking a different tune...

01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:14.347
so off we go
to the frat house.

01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:16.981
Half the girls were there,
about a zillion boys.

01:48:17.057 --> 01:48:21.858
They're cheering my name.
"Laine! Laine! Laine!"

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:25.455
And I'm just stumbling around.

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:31.866
Eventually I just say,
"I'm gonna go for it."

01:48:31.938 --> 01:48:36.466
If getting laid is a common initiation
for boys in the frat...

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:39.637
then why not for us, right?

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:43.843
- You're asking me?
- No, I'm not.

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:47.216
Oh, sorry.
Sorry. Go ahead.

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:49.551
That's okay.

01:48:51.024 --> 01:48:53.584
So they send me
into this room.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:56.993
It's dark and dim.
There are these two guys.

01:48:57.063 --> 01:49:00.624
They both have towels
wrapped around their waists.

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:05.933
And the first guy,
he slips his towel off.

01:49:06.006 --> 01:49:09.840
And I see his thing, and...

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:13.141
I take it in my hand...

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:16.239
and I say...

01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:22.878
- It was the first thing
that came into my head.
- What did you say?

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:25.390
I said,
"I'm sorry, I don't smoke."

01:49:25.458 --> 01:49:28.518
[Both Laughing]

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:31.792
And then I just got
the hell out of there.

01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:35.667
You okay, sir?

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:40.968
Oh, no, I'm just thinking what I'd pay
to be back in college again.

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:48.313
The next day, the campus
was rampant with word...

01:49:48.381 --> 01:49:50.406
that I had been
the center of a gang-bang.

01:49:50.483 --> 01:49:52.576
I mean, the governor's daughter.

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:55.917
Let me tell you.
That's one hell of a bell to un-ring.

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:58.753
- What about the photographs?
- Not me.

01:49:58.825 --> 01:50:01.350
I never took my clothes off.

01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:04.625
Even if I had, I've got
this big birthmark on my right thigh...

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:07.531
that the lady with the lovely physique
in the photo lacks.

01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:11.935
- No witnesses?
- Pure urban legend.

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:15.168
A little bit of wishful thinking
thrown in, I think.

01:50:16.009 --> 01:50:18.671
You know, Laine...

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:23.079
you could've looked those pricks
in the eye and told them the truth.

01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:25.640
Under oath. Told them
they were full of shit.

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:30.053
And barring that,
you could've at least told me.

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:35.060
But see, it really wasn't any of your
business either, and it still isn't.

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:38.620
There's something about
almost puking on a Havana...

01:50:38.698 --> 01:50:41.064
that just turns a girl...
to blush.

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:45.468
This letter from Jack Bennet <i>... </i>

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:50.771
and Larry Bellows, affidavit, I guess,
that you got from Webster.

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:54.007
It pretty much says
that nothing happened that night.

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:58.244
- They're ready
to come forward to be deposed.
- That's very good of them.

01:50:58.318 --> 01:51:01.879
So, that's it. The end.
Good guys win.

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:05.254
I'm gonna call a press conference
tomorrow, read that letter...

01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:09.989
and damn it if you don't have
the fastest confirmation on record.

01:51:10.063 --> 01:51:11.997
No, sir.

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:14.659
"No, sir"?
What, "No, sir"?

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:19.433
I would prefer that we not
have the press conference, sir.

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:22.873
Laine, maybe you've been out
of law school too long.

01:51:22.942 --> 01:51:26.105
- This is what they call
exculpatory evidence.
- Yes, I realize that.

01:51:26.179 --> 01:51:30.081
- This is your ticket to wherever
history is gonna take you.
- Yes.

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:33.881
But principles only mean
something if you stick by them
when they're inconvenient.

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:38.389
If I ever did
answer the questions...

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:42.155
you know,
even to exonerate myself...

01:51:42.228 --> 01:51:45.857
that would mean that it was
okay for them to have been
asked in the first place...

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:47.866
and it isn't.

01:51:47.934 --> 01:51:50.664
- You would sacrifice your reputation?
- Yes, I would.

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:54.264
People have sacrificed
a lot more for a lot less.

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.331
<i>[People Chattering]</i>

01:51:56.409 --> 01:52:00.641
- We've got him! We have Goliath.
- Sir, are you all right, sir?

01:52:00.714 --> 01:52:04.172
- It's okay, guys. Busted.
- POTUS is secure.

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:07.816
<i>[Radio Announcer]</i>
<i>Of course, the president addressing</i>
<i>a joint session of Congress... </i>

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:10.321
<i>is always unusual, </i>
<i>always an event. </i>

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:13.291
<i>This speech is scheduled</i>
<i>to begin momentarily. </i>

01:52:13.359 --> 01:52:16.760
<i>We understand the president</i>
<i>has arrived at the U.S. Capitol. </i>

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:20.322
[Laine] I don't care if I never
see any of these guys again.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.837
<i>[Radio] Sources in the White House</i>
<i>have told us that the president... </i>

01:52:24.904 --> 01:52:28.533
- It's gonna be okay.
<i>- Does intend to withdraw the name</i>
<i>of Senator Laine B. Hanson... </i>

01:52:28.608 --> 01:52:33.511
I still have a year and a half on
my term. That's a long time to recover.

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:39.041
- Then there's always...
<i>- Given the stunning charges</i>
<i>made against Governor Hathaway... </i>

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:43.283
- Laine, honey, it's gonna be fine.
<i>- Those on the inside are suggesting... </i>

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:45.324
- It's gonna be okay.
<i>- The president will designate... </i>

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:48.656
<i>-Ambassador Francis J. Malloy</i>
<i>as his number two. </i>
- Yeah, thanks.

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:52.293
Pace me at five to ten, okay?

01:52:55.535 --> 01:53:00.370
<i>[Radio Announcer]</i>
<i>... after the greeting</i>
<i>of the president of the United States. </i>

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:04.274
<i>Mr. Speaker, the president</i>
<i>of the United States of America. </i>

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:22.154
<i>Thank you. </i>

01:54:24.557 --> 01:54:29.893
Napoleon once said,
when asked to explain the lack
of great statesmen in the world...

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:32.454
that, "to get power...

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:36.024
you need to display
absolute pettiness.

01:54:36.102 --> 01:54:40.198
To exercise power,
you need to show true greatness."

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:44.835
<i>Such pettiness and such greatness</i>
<i>are rarely found in one person. </i>

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:48.347
<i>I look upon the events</i>
<i>of the past weeks... </i>

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:52.214
<i>and I've never come so to grips</i>
<i>with that quotation. </i>

01:54:52.285 --> 01:54:54.617
So, ladies and gentlemen
of this Congress...

01:54:54.687 --> 01:55:00.091
it pains my soul to tell you
that you have brought blood
and shame under this great dome.

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:04.619
Your leadership has raised
the stakes of hate to a level...

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:09.259
where we can no longer separate
the demagogue from the truly inspired.

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:14.671
And believe this,
there are traitors among us.

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:19.337
<i>And I'm not talking about those of you</i>
<i>who sided against your party leadership. </i>

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:23.371
<i>I'm talking about those of you</i>
<i>who were patriots to your party... </i>

01:55:23.449 --> 01:55:27.078
but traitors
to the necessary end result:

01:55:27.153 --> 01:55:30.384
<i>that of righteousness, </i>
<i>the truth... </i>

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:35.792
the concept of making
the American dream blind to gender.

01:55:35.862 --> 01:55:40.265
<i>And you know, </i>
<i>I am not free of blame. </i>

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:42.733
Right from the start
I should've come down here...

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:46.033
pointed a finger your way...

01:55:46.105 --> 01:55:48.198
pointed a finger <i>your</i> way...

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:51.801
<i>and asked you, </i>
<i>"Have you no decency, sir?"</i>

01:55:53.646 --> 01:55:56.740
<i>Yesterday... </i>

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:59.148
I met...

01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:02.016
<i>Mr. Runyon... </i>

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:05.182
you may walk out on me,
you may walk out on this body...

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:10.093
but you cannot walk out
on the will of the American people.

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:13.155
<i>Americans are a good people, </i>
<i>they're a just people, Mr. Runyon... </i>

01:56:13.232 --> 01:56:16.998
and they will forgive you,
but they will not forget.

01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:19.698
Hate and ego
have no place residing...

01:56:19.772 --> 01:56:24.436
in what my good friend Laine Hanson
calls the chapel of democracy.

01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:26.410
<i>So, let me make one thing clear. </i>

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:31.007
<i>You come at us with whatever weapons</i>
<i>that you have in your arsenal... </i>

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:33.848
but there is
no weapon as powerful...

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:37.481
as that of an idea
whose time has come.

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:41.653
A woman will serve in the highest level
of the Executive. Simple as that.

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:45.027
<i>Yesterday... </i>

01:56:45.098 --> 01:56:48.659
I spoke with Laine Hanson.

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:52.068
I told her that she could decide
her own destiny.

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:55.107
If she wanted to continue
her fight for confirmation...

01:56:55.174 --> 01:56:58.871
that I would stand beside her.

01:56:58.945 --> 01:57:01.812
She has asked me
to allow her to step aside.

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:06.545
<i>She told me that she wanted</i>
<i>my administration to end on a note... </i>

01:57:06.619 --> 01:57:10.316
of triumph
and not controversy.

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:15.919
Understand, those of you who worked
to bring Laine Hanson down...

01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:19.624
that she asked to have her name
withdrawn from consideration...

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:23.567
not because she isn't great,
but because she isn't petty.

01:57:23.636 --> 01:57:27.231
<i>Because those two</i>
<i>conflicting leadership traits... </i>

01:57:27.306 --> 01:57:31.037
<i>could not live as one</i>
<i>within her body or her soul. </i>

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:34.568
Greatness.
It comes in many forms.

01:57:34.647 --> 01:57:38.549
Sometimes it comes in the form
of sacrifice. That's the loneliest form.

01:57:38.618 --> 01:57:43.021
<i>Now, it turns out</i>
<i>that Laine Hanson is a woman... </i>

01:57:43.089 --> 01:57:46.581
an American
of devout principle...

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:49.685
<i>and she has inspired me</i>
<i>to act alike... </i>

01:57:49.762 --> 01:57:54.995
and I cannot accept
Senator Hanson's withdrawal.

01:57:55.068 --> 01:58:00.335
<i>And I'm now calling for an immediate</i>
<i>vote of confirmation of Laine Hanson. </i>

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:02.374
And, Mr. Speaker...

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:06.936
I would like to make this
a live roll call.

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:09.811
I want to see the faces
of those of you...

01:58:09.882 --> 01:58:13.045
who would eliminate the possibility
of greatness in American leadership...

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:17.351
because of half-truths,
lies and innuendoes.

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:20.449
I will not be deterred
by partisanship.

01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:22.460
I will not be deterred
by misogyny.

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:25.019
<i>I will not be deterred</i>
<i>by hate. </i>

01:58:25.098 --> 01:58:28.261
You have now come face-to-face
with my will.

01:58:29.335 --> 01:58:32.600
<i>Confirm my nominee, </i>
<i>heal this nation... </i>

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:36.802
and let the American people
explode into this new millennium...

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:42.075
with the exhilaration of being true
to the glory of this democracy.

01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:43.911
Thank you.

01:59:29.862 --> 01:59:32.854
How's that for a swan song?

01:59:32.932 --> 01:59:35.332
You're back, Laine.

01:59:35.401 --> 01:59:38.427
Yeah, I know.
