WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:06.538
(mambo music playing,
lively chatter)

00:08.575 --> 00:10.308
Hey,<i> salud!</i>

00:10.343 --> 00:11.343
(laughs)

00:11.378 --> 00:14.380
<i>Zanya, dos mojitos.</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:19.385
You know, we still got snow
on the ground in Toledo.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.354
Fancy.

00:22.389 --> 00:23.588
What do you call that one?

00:23.623 --> 00:25.524
<i> La Habana caliente.</i>

00:25.559 --> 00:28.060
<i> La Habana caliente. </i>
Sand, ocean

00:28.095 --> 00:30.529
and sun, topped with fire.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.696
Wow.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.565
Excuse me, can I borrow a match?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.200
Yeah, I think I
have a lighter.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.701
Even better.

00:36.736 --> 00:37.368
(gunshot)

00:37.404 --> 00:39.438
(people gasping, murmuring)

00:41.608 --> 00:43.509
¶ ¶

01:01.828 --> 01:03.462
Can I please have my phone back?

01:03.497 --> 01:05.330
One more minute.
You said that ten minutes ago.

01:05.365 --> 01:06.731
Mm.
Good morning!

01:06.766 --> 01:08.533
Morning.
Bring me a cappuccino?

01:08.568 --> 01:11.503
I sent you a text
to see if you wanted in.

01:11.538 --> 01:12.671
Really?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.806
Yeah, no, I got that text.
I just couldn't answer back,

01:14.841 --> 01:17.275
'cause I was in the middle
of this massive download.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.144
SAM: Hootie &
the Blowfish?

01:19.179 --> 01:21.213
Or Kenny G?

01:21.248 --> 01:23.682
No, it's not music.
It's actually science.

01:23.717 --> 01:24.850
It's actually nonsense.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.152
Yeah? What, like a, uh,
relationship compatibility test?

01:27.187 --> 01:28.753
Mm, yes.
We'd fail that today.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.222
(phone beeps)
DEEKS: Oh, done. Good.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.324
Ready to rock and roll.
There you are, princess.

01:32.359 --> 01:35.193
Gentlemen, ponder this question:

01:35.228 --> 01:36.795
Who speaks more words in a day?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.630
Is it a woman or a man?

01:38.665 --> 01:40.432
Well, it depends on the woman.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.633
Depends on the man.

01:41.668 --> 01:42.634
Agreed.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.636
If it's G, less than 500 a day.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.838
If it's Deeks, over a million.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.307
Okay. Actually,
there was a book in 2006

01:49.342 --> 01:51.643
called<i> The Female Brain, </i>
written by a woman,

01:51.678 --> 01:54.646
that stated that a man
speaks 7,000 words in a day,

01:54.681 --> 01:56.648
where a woman speaks
over 20,000.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.850
That's almost
three times as many.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.186
And we care about
this because...?

02:01.221 --> 02:02.587
You don't.
You absolutely don't.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.656
Because it is
a stupid, sexist stereotype

02:04.691 --> 02:05.724
that needs to
be debunked.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.859
Which is why we're settling it
once and for all,

02:07.894 --> 02:09.661
with the help
of our word-counting app.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.863
Lowest score wins.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.665
Smart money's on Kensi.
What?

02:13.700 --> 02:14.699
No. Do not-- No, no.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.868
Do not confuse me
with my undercover personae.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.603
You know,
the-the manic homeless guy,

02:18.638 --> 02:20.405
the charming
yet chatty concierge...

02:20.440 --> 02:22.707
The annoying special agent.

02:22.742 --> 02:23.742
Touché.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.743
That is a touché.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.344
All right, let the games begin.

02:26.379 --> 02:27.412
Hit it.
Go.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.413
(whistles)

02:28.448 --> 02:30.549
What is...?

02:30.584 --> 02:31.783
Briefcase.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.885
Cut that in half.
Case!

02:33.920 --> 02:35.921
KENSI: On.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.259
Case on deck!
(whistles)

02:41.294 --> 02:44.429
I, too, pride myself
on being a man of few words.

02:44.464 --> 02:45.830
That's 11 words, Eric.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.866
Three would've done the trick.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.771
This is last night
at The Oriana.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.509
Did we catch the shooter?

02:57.544 --> 02:58.376
Crowded nightclub.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.678
They must have
escaped in the chaos.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.679
Who's the victim?

03:00.714 --> 03:01.947
ERIC:
A tourist from Ohio.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.583
We think the real target
was bartender

03:04.618 --> 03:06.451
Victor Larmont,
who escaped unharmed.

03:06.486 --> 03:07.786
And what's his connection
to the Navy?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.821
NELL: Well, his estranged
wife, Rebecca, works

03:09.856 --> 03:12.624
in the computer graphics
department at NXRD.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.758
Defense contractor.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.760
They design nuclear attack subs.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.929
So why go after
the husband?

03:17.964 --> 03:19.798
Two days ago,
Victor texted a tip

03:19.833 --> 03:21.733
to the NCIS
crime reporting system.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.936
He claims he has evidence his
wife is selling Navy secrets

03:24.971 --> 03:26.538
to a foreign government.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.940
So just to clarify,
the husband ratted out the wife.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.611
Huh, yeah, looks like somebody
didn't want him talking.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.279
CALLEN: Okay,
Kensi, Deeks,

03:34.314 --> 03:35.413
why don't you start at...
DEEKS: The nightclub?

03:35.448 --> 03:36.681
...Rebecca's office.
(groans)

03:36.716 --> 03:38.350
She may relate more to
a female special agent.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.952
Makes sense. 'Cause women
have much more to talk about.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.788
Like their shoes and
their favorite nail salons,

03:43.823 --> 03:45.590
latest haircuts,

03:45.625 --> 03:48.460
eyebrow shaping,
spinning class....

03:48.495 --> 03:49.961
You're losing.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.630
What?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.531
He's losing.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.198
In more ways than one.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.801
You taking side bets, Deeks?

03:59.839 --> 04:02.874
¶ ¶
(grunting)

04:02.909 --> 04:05.377
MAN: Okay,
just like that.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.012
And now try
a simple turn.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.318
No, wrong.
Completely wrong.
(music stops)

04:13.353 --> 04:15.453
The audition
is over. Adios.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.721
Next!

04:16.756 --> 04:19.491
He takes his mambo seriously.
Yeah.

04:19.526 --> 04:20.959
Good morning.
Morning, Detective.

04:20.994 --> 04:21.826
Morning.
Your guy's

04:21.861 --> 04:22.627
at the side bar.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.796
Shots came
from the upper balcony.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.464
Any security footage up there?

04:26.499 --> 04:28.633
The shooter
was conveniently off camera.

04:28.668 --> 04:30.535
Disappeared into the crowd.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.337
You shutting them down?
We're trying not to,

04:32.372 --> 04:33.738
for the sake
of their business.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.873
They haven't had
trouble here before.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.542
Let me know if you need me.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.711
Thank you.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.814
Victor Larmont.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.749
Special Agent Callen, NCIS.
(music resumes)

04:44.784 --> 04:46.818
Special Agent Hanna.
Did you get my text?

04:46.853 --> 04:48.620
That's why
we're here.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.822
You didn't think about
taking any time off?

04:50.857 --> 04:53.792
Uh, yeah. But I can't afford to.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.060
You're concerned
about your wife.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.062
Ex-wife, almost.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.331
Last week, at 1:00 a.m.,

04:59.366 --> 05:02.767
I got a text meant
for someone else.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.804
"Meet me north stairwell."

05:05.839 --> 05:07.906
You see what I'm
talking about?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.808
Not exactly.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.609
Well, come on,
working late hours

05:11.644 --> 05:13.945
on classified material?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.881
That can be a telltale
sign of espionage.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.019
That's all you got?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.788
No.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.690
She just bought
a new Porsche.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.960
Something that she could
never afford on her own.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.996
Unless she was selling
military secrets.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.701
Phones stay outside
the workplace,

05:36.736 --> 05:38.970
but hold on
to your weapons.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.438
Oh. Right?
Yay. Ooh...

05:40.473 --> 05:42.607
Thank you.
This...?

05:42.642 --> 05:45.110
Um, how long have you
worked with Rebecca?

05:45.145 --> 05:48.446
Long time.
She started in '09.

05:48.481 --> 05:49.781
Suspicious behavior?

05:49.816 --> 05:51.716
From Rebecca?
Absolutely none.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.485
Change in her
regular working hours?

05:53.520 --> 05:54.986
We have flexible
scheduling.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.455
She's not a morning person,
comes in at noon,

05:57.490 --> 05:58.757
usually works till midnight.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.958
Her files?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.927
What about them?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.997
Any unauthorized use?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.932
Security is ironclad.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.901
She can't copy, print,
photograph

06:09.936 --> 06:12.637
or download anything
without leaving a trail.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.906
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Gail Walker to Human Resources.

06:14.941 --> 06:15.940
Excuse me.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.009
Thank you very much.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.546
(whistles)

06:25.585 --> 06:27.051
Rebecca Larmont?

06:27.086 --> 06:29.020
Special Agent Kensi Blye,
NCIS.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.455
Deeks.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.023
Is this about my polygraph test?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.525
Because I just took it
last month.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.993
No, it's not.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.828
How are things going
between you and your husband?

06:36.863 --> 06:38.963
Not great.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.999
We've been separated
for about two years,

06:41.034 --> 06:43.968
and the divorce proceedings are
moving very slowly.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.938
Your husband notified us
because he was concerned

06:46.973 --> 06:49.174
you were mishandling
classified information.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.510
Oh, God.

06:52.545 --> 06:55.013
He's such an idiot.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.080
He doesn't get
what he wants,

06:56.115 --> 06:57.882
so now he has to
take it out on me.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.983
He's very mature.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.052
I make about four
times what he does.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.021
At the spousal-support
hearing last month,

07:03.056 --> 07:06.224
he didn't get the monthly
payments that he was hoping for.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.992
This is his revenge,

07:08.027 --> 07:10.962
making up crazy accusations
just to annoy me.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.730
KENSI: He had
one more concern.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.866
Apparently you texted
him accidentally

07:14.901 --> 07:16.868
at 1:00 in the morning.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.036
Who were you
actually meeting?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.071
That was meant for
a colleague of mine

07:20.106 --> 07:21.039
who also works late.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.174
We walk to the garage
together for safety.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.210
This is why
he called you in?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.479
Well, that and the fact
that someone tried

07:27.514 --> 07:29.214
to kill him last night.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.549
Tried to kill him?

07:31.584 --> 07:33.551
Who did? Why?

07:33.586 --> 07:36.054
(sighs) What has he gotten
himself into now?

07:36.089 --> 07:37.489
(alarm buzzer blares)

07:37.524 --> 07:38.823
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Security Breach Protocol.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.225
Close all classified files.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.493
KENSI:
What was that?

07:41.528 --> 07:42.861
Somebody made it
through security

07:42.896 --> 07:43.862
without a full screening.

07:43.897 --> 07:44.929
It happens every
now and then.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.899
Rebecca Larmont?
Rebecca Larmont?

07:47.934 --> 07:49.801
Did you order
a pizza?
No.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.636
Stop where you are!

07:51.671 --> 07:53.238
Not until I make
my delivery.
KENSI: Stop him. Oh!

07:56.309 --> 08:00.111
Rebecca Larmont,
you've been served.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.149
REBECCA:
Seriously?

08:05.184 --> 08:07.952
This is Victor,
my soon-to-be ex.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.054
Do you see what
I'm dealing with?

08:10.089 --> 08:12.691
And who is trying to kill you?

08:18.898 --> 08:20.165
Good tackle.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.976
Oh...

08:32.011 --> 08:33.545
if this word-count thing
is gonna be accurate,

08:33.580 --> 08:34.746
you have to talk
like you normally do.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.714
Hmm.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.983
Say yes.
Yes.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.218
And enough of the
one-word answers.

08:40.253 --> 08:45.924
I am so winning this.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.662
Guys, this is ridiculous.
What are you thinking?

08:50.697 --> 08:52.163
Well, we're thinking you're

08:52.198 --> 08:54.599
a pretty lucky guy
there, Victor.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.800
Yeah, if we hadn't
stepped in,

08:55.835 --> 08:57.201
you would have
ended up in jail.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.003
I was serving papers.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.071
You know there are
professionals

09:00.106 --> 09:01.072
who do that, right?

09:01.107 --> 09:03.241
Who I cannot afford.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.742
I have to subpoena
her car loan,

09:04.777 --> 09:06.611
her credit card statements
and her bank accounts

09:06.646 --> 09:08.179
to get a better
alimony settlement.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.347
Dude, you can't serve
your own papers.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.149
It's not legally binding.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.885
You sure about that?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.019
KENSI: Oh, I would
trust him.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.022
Surprisingly, he actually
graduated from law school.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.224
Really.
Yeah. You need
a better lawyer.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.293
I'm representing myself.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.196
Like I said, you need
a better lawyer.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.666
I burned through all
of my savings with an attorney.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.101
It got me as far
as a court hearing,

09:30.136 --> 09:31.736
where I was offered
three grand a month.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.137
Three grand a month?
That's a lot of money.

09:33.172 --> 09:37.041
2,400 a month after taxes.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.177
She's lying about her income.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.781
She doesn't care.
She's heartless.

09:44.651 --> 09:47.118
Why does she have to
treat me like dirt?

09:48.988 --> 09:51.356
Um, how long were
you guys married?

09:51.391 --> 09:54.025
Ten years.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.860
We got engaged
when I was

09:55.895 --> 09:58.763
captain of the college
baseball team.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.165
They say opposites attract.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.334
I was head over heels.

10:03.369 --> 10:07.305
And then we got married
when I was picked second round

10:07.340 --> 10:08.239
by Major League
Baseball.

10:08.275 --> 10:12.810
Second... Wow, that's...
that's impressive.

10:12.845 --> 10:17.015
Seven years later,
I was cut from the minors.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.250
Never did sign that
$100 million contract

10:19.285 --> 10:20.285
she was expecting.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.390
She says she needs a guy
with more intellect

10:25.425 --> 10:28.226
and drive, but it's
all about money.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.264
She's dating
investment bankers.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.101
And if that's not working out,

10:37.136 --> 10:39.237
I think she'd sell
government secrets

10:39.272 --> 10:40.905
to pump up her bank account.

10:43.876 --> 10:47.412
I think it's time to take
a closer look at the wife.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.948
(computer beeps)

10:50.983 --> 10:52.817
Breaking news, guys.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.752
Victor's nightclub
is a hangout for

10:54.787 --> 10:56.954
Cuban expatriates
living in L.A.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.357
Last time I checked, Cubans
aren't spying for Russia.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.159
No, not since 2001

11:01.194 --> 11:03.094
when Moscow closed
the Lourdes listening post

11:03.129 --> 11:04.996
that was costing them
almost $200 million a year.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.431
This is breaking news?

11:06.466 --> 11:07.799
Wait for it.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.867
Rebecca's new Porsche
was subsidized

11:09.902 --> 11:13.237
by a family doctor,
Alonzo Raul, from Cuba.

11:13.272 --> 11:16.774
He wrote a rather generous check

11:16.809 --> 11:18.142
for the down payment.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.277
How generous?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.345
$40,000 generous.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.314
Money
for nuclear submarine plans?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.849
Yeah, at a bargain price.

11:24.884 --> 11:25.850
Thanks, guys.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.852
ERIC:
You're very welcome.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.087
CALLEN:
Is that him?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.354
SAM:
Yeah.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.223
Alonzo Raul?

11:32.258 --> 11:33.257
Yes?
Special Agent Callen.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.759
Special Agent Sam Hanna.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.328
NCIS.
Nice to meet you.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.396
Nice to meet you.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.032
We're investigating
Rebecca Larmont.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.266
Is she okay?

11:42.301 --> 11:44.235
Oh, yeah, she's fine.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.336
How well do you know her?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.238
Extremely well.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.873
That's<i> mi novia.</i>

11:48.908 --> 11:50.108
That's my girlfriend.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.343
You recently purchased her
a car.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.745
(chuckles)
It's a pretty big gift.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.013
She's more than a girlfriend.
Ah.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.783
Uh, here. There it is.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.386
Engaged?
Not yet, but very soon.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.354
How long you two
been, uh...

12:03.389 --> 12:04.789
dating?

12:04.824 --> 12:06.023
A long time.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.325
Over a year.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.061
I'm waiting
for the divorce to be final

12:10.096 --> 12:11.362
before I pop the question.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.064
But I knew right away.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.433
Two or three months in,
I knew she was the one.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.335
Where'd you guys meet?

12:17.370 --> 12:20.905
Um, in the Ballona salt marsh,

12:20.940 --> 12:22.774
with the Audubon Society.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.842
We're both lovers
of ornithology

12:24.877 --> 12:26.077
since we were kids.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.245
You grew up in Cuba?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.212
Yes.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.914
Do you get back often?

12:29.949 --> 12:31.449
Uh, never. I can't.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.419
I was trained as a physician
and sent to Venezuela.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.488
In exchange for doctors,

12:37.523 --> 12:41.526
Venezuela gives Cuba
100,000 barrels of oil daily.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.929
That's a billion dollars of oil,

12:44.964 --> 12:48.399
and I was making $50 a month.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.403
So I got tired of, uh,
Fidel's empty promises,

12:52.438 --> 12:56.374
and five years ago, I fled.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.143
Thanks for your time.
Thank you.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.312
Oh, uh, one more thing.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.114
You ever been to The Oriana?

13:03.149 --> 13:05.817
The nightclub?
Yeah.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.485
Yeah, they say it's popular
among Cuban expats.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.253
Never been in there.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.822
It's not my kind of place.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.423
You know Rebecca's husband
works there.

13:12.458 --> 13:16.360
I've never met him, but I...

13:16.395 --> 13:18.363
I know he's desperate for money.

13:22.201 --> 13:25.069
Think he'll buy it?

13:25.104 --> 13:26.470
It's all about misdirection.

13:26.505 --> 13:28.339
He'll never realize
he's the suspect

13:28.374 --> 13:29.540
if he thinks he's
working for us.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.075
Here we go.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.877
Victor? Hey.
Hi.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.879
What are you guys doing here?

13:34.914 --> 13:37.481
Well... (clears throat)

13:37.516 --> 13:39.350
You were right.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.519
We linked Rebecca
to some spy work

13:41.554 --> 13:43.020
being coordinated
here at the club.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.356
(sighs)
I knew it.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.959
It's gonna be
an undercover operation, Victor.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.528
Do you think you can pretend
you never met us before?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.230
Of course.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.132
Okay. Kensi's gonna audition
as a dancer.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.601
Bad idea.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.069
She'll never get it.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.271
Perez only hires the very best.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.907
Okay, well,
in case you're right,

14:02.942 --> 14:04.375
does he need bartenders?

14:04.410 --> 14:05.977
Nope.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.979
Only job opening
is men's bathroom attendant.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.414
(sighs)

14:10.449 --> 14:11.415
All right.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.217
You take some classes
and come back next year.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.318
Who's next?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.320
Uh, me. Hi. I'm Kaitlin.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.456
Perez.
Any professional experience?

14:18.491 --> 14:21.192
Um, my friends and I go dancing
every Friday and Saturday night.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.560
They say I'm pretty good.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.262
Do us both a favor and go home.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.498
My feet are tired, and you're
not what I'm looking for.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.402
KENSI: Um, I would
really love a chance,

14:31.437 --> 14:33.070
Señor Perez.

14:33.105 --> 14:34.272
It's Señor Bianco.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.940
Perez is my first name.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.609
Kind of like Pérez Prado.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.078
King of the Mambo.

14:41.113 --> 14:42.480
Yeah.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.182
I was named after him.
Hmm.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.184
It's sad,
people have forgotten his music.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.420
Oh, no, I've definitely
not forgotten his music.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.455
My mom would play the tapes
when I was young.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.457
We'd dance around in
the kitchen. It was really fun.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.959
You can mambo?

14:54.994 --> 14:57.428
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna give you

14:57.463 --> 14:58.362
one minute.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.165
(mambo music plays)

15:01.200 --> 15:02.433
Cuban salsa.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.936
Follow my lead.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.707
Five, six, seven and eight
and...

15:09.742 --> 15:11.943
¶ ¶

15:20.586 --> 15:22.186
Eh, you're not bad.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.189
PEREZ: Show me
what you've got.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.659
Inside turn.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.695
(speaks in Spanish)

15:30.730 --> 15:33.298
And cross arm embrace.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.668
(Kensi clears her throat)

15:37.703 --> 15:40.237
Just have a few questions.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.505
Okay.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.274
Like when can you start?

15:43.309 --> 15:44.508
(laughs)

15:44.543 --> 15:46.344
How about right now?

15:46.379 --> 15:48.312
All right. Go down
to the dressing room.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.014
Look for an outfit.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.515
Awesome. Thank you.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.150
(phone ringing)

15:53.185 --> 15:54.986
(music stops)

15:55.021 --> 15:56.387
Let me call you back later.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.022
Excuse me, Perez?

15:58.057 --> 16:00.224
Applicant
for the men's room attendant.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.526
We're looking for someone
fluent in Spanish.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.662
No problemo, amigo.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.464
Uh, seriously.
Most of our clientele

16:06.499 --> 16:07.765
is Spanish-speaking only.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.001
(speaking in Spanish)

16:33.259 --> 16:35.259
¶ ¶

16:58.751 --> 17:00.618
¶ ¶

17:23.709 --> 17:25.710
(radio crackles to life)

17:33.652 --> 17:35.719
(camera clicking)

17:35.754 --> 17:37.755
(footsteps)

17:55.374 --> 17:57.441
SAM:
Is that a ham radio?

17:57.476 --> 18:00.111
HETTY:
Indeed.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.612
SAM: It's not exactly
state of the art.

18:01.647 --> 18:05.382
Well, that's a Swan transceiver.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.119
Very popular in the '60s,

18:08.154 --> 18:10.788
when every agent was
a licensed operator,

18:10.823 --> 18:13.157
fluent in Morse code.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.892
The good old days.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.460
Oh, don't underestimate
the power

18:16.495 --> 18:19.430
of short wave radio, Mr. Callen.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.133
Hetty, those frequencies
are public.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.801
You put a message out there,
anyone can hear it.

18:23.836 --> 18:27.405
But maybe not understand it.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.908
MAN (over laptop):
<i> Atención.</i>

18:30.943 --> 18:32.743
<i> Atención.</i>

18:32.778 --> 18:35.913
(counting in Spanish)

18:35.948 --> 18:38.349
Okay. Is that a numbers station?

18:38.384 --> 18:39.650
It's a recording

18:39.685 --> 18:42.286
from 1972 of coded messages

18:42.321 --> 18:46.924
being transmitted
from Havana to spies in Miami.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.626
And each number
represents a letter.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.494
Mm-hmm.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.596
If you crack the code,
you decipher the message.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.498
Why would anyone
still use these?

18:54.533 --> 18:56.433
Think about it.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.801
There's thousands
of frequencies,

18:57.836 --> 18:59.336
they can't all be monitored.

18:59.371 --> 19:02.173
There's no digital record
like phone, text and e-mail.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.507
We're normalizing
relations with Cuba.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.209
Just because we
found a ham radio

19:05.244 --> 19:06.544
doesn't mean they're spying.

19:06.579 --> 19:10.781
The KGB trained thousands
of Cuban spies

19:10.816 --> 19:13.384
before the fall of the USSR.

19:13.419 --> 19:17.888
Now, as free agents, they're
able to gather intelligence

19:17.923 --> 19:22.860
and sell it
to the world's highest bidder.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.596
Nuclear submarine plans.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.899
That's a big ticket item.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.534
We need to monitor
every broadcast

19:30.569 --> 19:31.936
that comes from that club.

19:31.971 --> 19:32.870
Yeah, and that
Cuban doctor.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.939
Let's make sure he
didn't get too chatty

19:34.974 --> 19:36.740
with that girlfriend of his.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.243
CALLEN:
Rebecca.

19:39.278 --> 19:40.211
Special Agent Callen.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.446
Special Agent Sam Hanna, NCIS.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.747
What happened to the other two?

19:43.782 --> 19:45.783
Oh, they got
reassigned.

19:47.786 --> 19:48.953
Is that a woodpecker?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.321
Red-breasted sapsucker.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.590
<i> Sphyrapicus rubus.</i>

19:52.625 --> 19:54.758
Ooh.
It's what I do to clear my brain

19:54.793 --> 19:57.428
after staring at a computer
screen like a zombie.
Cool.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.663
So look, we just have
a few more questions.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.900
Uh, I understand you passed
your polygraph, uh, last month.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.468
Mm-hmm.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.504
Specifically, uh, you answered
"no" on the question,

20:07.539 --> 20:10.274
"have you had any
unauthorized foreign contact?"

20:10.309 --> 20:11.242
Uh-huh.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.811
Your boyfriend's from Cuba.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.380
Alonzo became a U.S. citizen
four years ago,

20:16.415 --> 20:20.618
so the correct answer
is no... right?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.319
Is he familiar with your work?

20:22.354 --> 20:23.821
He knows what I do.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.258
Has he taken any sort of special
interest, asked you any details?

20:27.293 --> 20:30.261
Of course not, and I wouldn't
tell him if he did.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.263
Nor would I be with him.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.466
How about accessing
your computer?

20:35.501 --> 20:38.002
Look, if you want to know
about suspicious activity,

20:38.037 --> 20:40.504
take a look
at my crazy ex, Victor.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.640
Even though I've tried
to change all of my passwords,

20:42.675 --> 20:45.276
there was a time
when he knew them all.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.478
Has he logged on to anything?

20:47.513 --> 20:50.514
I couldn't get into a movie
last week

20:50.549 --> 20:53.317
because he closed
my AMC account.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.054
Well, if there's
any other suspicious activity,

20:57.089 --> 20:58.856
just let us know.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.391
Of course.
Thanks for your help.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.426
Thank you.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.863
Yeah.
(sighs)

21:05.898 --> 21:07.298
She seems legit.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.633
Spotlight switches
back to Victor.

21:09.668 --> 21:13.370
If he can access her classified
files, he could make a fortune.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.606
Put the blame back on her.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.375
Yeah, but then,
why'd someone try to kill him?

21:18.410 --> 21:19.943
Maybe he staged it.

21:19.978 --> 21:21.945
You know? Had someone
shoot and miss,

21:21.980 --> 21:24.615
so that he looks like a
victim and not a suspect.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.317
It's an interesting theory.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.052
Kensi and Deeks
can check it out.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.288
(mambo music playing)

21:34.493 --> 21:39.396
One, two, three, four, five.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.332
Uh, uh, one, dos.

21:41.367 --> 21:44.335
Five and six, seven,
eight, and one.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.570
Two, three, four, five.

21:46.605 --> 21:47.905
Back, five.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.073
And now for the ending.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.541
I go under your leg,

21:50.576 --> 21:53.411
and come around your waist.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.447
(Kensi grunts)

21:56.482 --> 21:57.548
That's quite the workout.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.683
Yeah. Needs to be tighter, okay?

21:59.718 --> 22:00.851
Yeah.
All right.

22:00.886 --> 22:03.087
Uh, let's try this.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.723
Go back. Five, six...

22:05.758 --> 22:08.425
And around...

22:08.460 --> 22:10.361
There you go.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.096
Oh! Uh...

22:12.131 --> 22:13.530
What are you doing?

22:13.565 --> 22:15.532
I'm so sorry, I was just
doing this Costco run.

22:15.567 --> 22:18.435
Did you guys know that they have
a ten-gallon jar of pickles?

22:18.470 --> 22:20.070
Just a big ol' jar
with a bunch of pickles in it.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.572
Hi, I'm Marty
from the men's room.

22:21.607 --> 22:22.873
Hi. Kaitlin, new dancer.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.742
So I saw you guys
doing the wicked moves out here.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.077
Is that the lambada?
You guys gonna rehearse?

22:27.112 --> 22:29.079
(music starts)
Okay, I'm gonna go.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.415
Here, and then...
Got a wheel that's here
that's bad.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.449
(music stops)
Wait, what?

22:32.484 --> 22:34.084
Your cart's got a bad wheel.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.519
Fine. No more interruptions.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.821
I know, I was just thinking
maybe I could replace it...
Thank you.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.692
Thank you!
'cause I was at Costco--
I got a membership rewards card

22:41.727 --> 22:43.427
and a...
Hey,<i> callate.</i>

22:43.462 --> 22:44.695
<i> ¿Callate? </i>
Yeah.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.131
Oh, yeah, no, I can<i> callate.</i>
This is me<i> callate-ing.</i>

22:47.166 --> 22:48.766
You guys continue your little

22:48.801 --> 22:51.102
forbidden dance of passion.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.173
All right, Victor.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.443
What do you have in here?

22:59.478 --> 23:00.844
Couple of books.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.747
<i> Soul Mate Search After 40.</i>

23:03.782 --> 23:05.082
<i> Begin Again: Surviving Divorce</i>

23:05.117 --> 23:08.185
and<i> Duct Tape</i>
<i> for the Broken Spirit.</i>

23:08.220 --> 23:10.087
Looks like Victor is the owner

23:10.122 --> 23:13.957
of a lonely... hard drive.

23:13.992 --> 23:16.693
Hey, I see you.
What are you doing?

23:16.728 --> 23:19.496
Yeah, definitely gonna
have to take you for a spin,

23:19.531 --> 23:21.064
see what you're working with.

23:21.099 --> 23:23.600
What about our sweet friend
Perez, huh? Rico Suave?

23:23.635 --> 23:25.669
You got yours locked,
which means you're definitely

23:25.704 --> 23:28.038
hiding something.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.508
(chuckles)

23:31.543 --> 23:34.111
Oh, wow.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.814
We're rocking a little,
uh, Vanilla Vanquish.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.148
Super classy.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.150
Thought you'd be
more of a Drakkar Noir.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.986
Copious amount of condoms.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.888
Not gonna need those.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.057
What size? Petite.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.459
What?

23:50.562 --> 23:53.964
Oh, sweet, sweet Perez.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.799
And Anonymous.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.035
But heavily used.

23:58.070 --> 24:01.972
That's an interesting
combination.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.140
Pad of paper.

24:03.175 --> 24:07.110
Sometimes you got
to ask yourself WWCD?

24:07.145 --> 24:09.146
What would Colombo do?

24:16.188 --> 24:17.654
Oh.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.524
Winner, winner, TV dinner.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.693
SAM:
Alonzo.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.528
Hey, I'm late
for a meeting. I...

24:24.563 --> 24:27.498
That's okay. We just wanted
to ask you about this.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.734
What about it?

24:30.769 --> 24:33.270
You met with Perez Bianco
outside The Oriana.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.672
Mm-hmm.

24:35.707 --> 24:38.008
You told us this morning
you've never been there.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.711
I said I'd never
been<i> inside</i> the place, huh?

24:40.746 --> 24:42.246
Oh.
Which is true. I haven't.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.114
Mm.
Okay.
Okay?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.249
What were you giving Perez?

24:45.284 --> 24:46.917
Hey, I'm his physician.

24:46.952 --> 24:49.286
That would be
doctor-patient confidentiality.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.522
Well, that's no problem.
We'll just get a court order

24:51.557 --> 24:52.723
to access his medical records.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.658
Yeah, in the meanwhile we'll
hang with you all day long.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.560
Everywhere you go.

24:56.595 --> 24:58.996
Okay, listen.

24:59.031 --> 25:02.165
Uh, Perez is a dancer--
he has a bad disc in his back.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.301
He needed some medication
to get through the show,

25:04.336 --> 25:05.569
so I brought it to him.

25:05.604 --> 25:07.971
You brought it to him? Wow, I
wish my doctor made house calls.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.139
Me, too.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.541
Well, some of us still do.

25:10.576 --> 25:11.375
All right? But really,

25:11.410 --> 25:13.143
I have to get
to the nursing home.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.545
What's with the car?

25:14.580 --> 25:15.946
Why the beater?

25:15.981 --> 25:17.748
You bought Rebecca a Porsche.

25:17.783 --> 25:20.083
I work in the inner city, eh?

25:20.118 --> 25:23.253
So, fancy cars, they get stolen,
they get broken into.

25:23.288 --> 25:24.555
Mm, really?
Right.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.789
Yeah.
Oh...

25:25.824 --> 25:26.990
Really?
Ay!

25:27.025 --> 25:30.227
(speaking Spanish)
My bad. I got a napkin.
I got a napkin.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.730
Come here.
All right, look at...

25:33.765 --> 25:35.999
Yeah, okay...
It could be worse--
you could be wearing khakis.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.634
You're good as new.
Okay, great.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.570
Okay.
Have a great day, guys.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.239
All righty.
Take care.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.841
ERIC:
<i> Hetty is very excited.</i>
<i> She's pretty sure</i>

25:44.876 --> 25:47.978
it's a one-time pad used
to translate number stations.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.980
Yeah, we can test it on the
next broadcast from the club.

25:50.015 --> 25:51.315
DEEKS:
Cool, cool, cool.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.117
Listen, do you guys have access
to-to Kensi's phone?

25:54.152 --> 25:55.919
I'm sorry,
is that a real question?

25:55.954 --> 25:59.189
I just need to know how many
words she's spoken today.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.357
Yeah, no problem.
What?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.593
No, that's totally cheating.

26:02.628 --> 26:03.760
All right, listen,
you little meerkats,

26:03.795 --> 26:06.330
I've spoken 5,962...

26:06.365 --> 26:07.364
three, four... Damn it. Five...

26:07.400 --> 26:09.900
Just tell me if it's
higher of lower than that.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.002
Sorry, buddy, no can do.

26:12.037 --> 26:13.904
Are we done here, Deeks?

26:13.939 --> 26:16.373
We're not done here yet. I got
a hard drive I need you to...

26:16.408 --> 26:18.375
Hey, Marty, how's it going?
Good, good.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.876
Everything's good. You?

26:19.911 --> 26:21.311
Feels like a James Bond movie.

26:21.346 --> 26:22.779
Easy.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.248
Oh, right. Sorry.

26:25.283 --> 26:26.617
Little advice.
Hmm?

26:26.652 --> 26:28.085
If you ever want
to see a paycheck,

26:28.120 --> 26:30.253
fill out your W-4 ASAP

26:30.288 --> 26:31.355
and give it to the guy that...

26:31.390 --> 26:33.957
Vic... Oh, Victor!

26:33.992 --> 26:36.226
Aah!

26:36.261 --> 26:38.629
(groans)
You okay?

26:38.664 --> 26:40.631
Yeah.
Oh.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.633
I'm starting to think that...

26:42.668 --> 26:44.902
someone doesn't like you.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.179
So the dumpster IED

26:56.214 --> 26:58.382
was gunpowder in
a water bottle.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.916
Not at all sophisticated.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.351
Or lethal.

27:01.386 --> 27:03.020
NELL: And there's
no suspicious activity

27:03.055 --> 27:04.755
on the alley security cameras.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.089
What about Victor's hard drive?

27:06.124 --> 27:08.091
Well, there are
three folders inside.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.060
Mm-hmm.
Recipes-- hundreds.

27:10.095 --> 27:13.363
Sidebar: the wild porcini
ragout looks pretty amazing.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.733
Mmm. Next, canine profiles
and invoices.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.802
Yes, he works
as a part-time dog walker.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.772
I could almost
like this guy.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.675
I know.
And lastly, his journal.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.109
And what's in there?

27:26.144 --> 27:29.046
Just pain. Heartache.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.982
Don't read it unless
you need a good cry.

27:32.017 --> 27:35.118
Well, the good news is you might
not need any more protection.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.020
They tried to
kill me. Twice.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.723
The path of the bullet last
night was way over your shoulder

27:39.758 --> 27:41.391
and the bomb was made
for cuts and bruises.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.460
In fact, if I was a cynic,
I might argue

27:43.495 --> 27:45.796
that you set this
while thing up yourself.

27:45.831 --> 27:46.697
That's crazy.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.999
Mm. Not if you're trying
to paint yourself

27:49.034 --> 27:50.834
as the victim
to cover up the truth.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.436
I'm not the bad guy.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.804
All right, so who is?

27:58.977 --> 28:00.744
It's Perez.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.312
Perez the dancer?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.781
He owns the club.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.117
I borrowed $10,000 from
him for my legal fees.

28:07.152 --> 28:09.052
Thought I'd have spousal
support by now,

28:09.087 --> 28:11.154
but it's dragging on.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.156
I'm four months
late with payback.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.891
So you're saying this Perez

28:14.926 --> 28:17.461
is making death threats
over $10,000?

28:17.496 --> 28:19.296
Well, now it's $40,000.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.231
There's ten percent
a week in interest.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.100
So he's a loan shark.

28:23.135 --> 28:26.369
With some money laundering
and extortion on the side.

28:26.404 --> 28:29.106
You want him off your back?

28:29.141 --> 28:31.875
And you're willing
to wear a wire?

28:31.910 --> 28:33.176
I guess.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.012
I mean, it's risky
if it's discovered.

28:36.448 --> 28:37.814
Fine.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.249
I'm better off dead.

28:39.284 --> 28:40.817
Come on, really?

28:40.852 --> 28:43.086
I can't make ends meet...

28:43.121 --> 28:45.455
I owe money to criminals...

28:45.490 --> 28:49.193
and... I don't think
I'll ever find love again.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.529
The ladies-- they
want a rich guy,

28:52.564 --> 28:55.532
not some bartender
who works for tips.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.400
Don't do that. Don't say that.
Listen, you're-you're

28:57.435 --> 28:59.302
a hard-working guy.
You know what I mean?

28:59.337 --> 29:01.905
I hear that you're
an amazing cook, I-I...

29:01.940 --> 29:03.273
You love dogs,
you write. It's like,

29:03.308 --> 29:05.175
you are what they call
a catch, my friend.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.077
I'm not cool like you.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.779
Come on.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.447
You're a secret agent.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.182
You're good
at everything.

29:12.217 --> 29:14.785
I'm not good at everything,
trust me.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.887
Name one thing
you're not good at.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.121
Okay, fine.

29:18.156 --> 29:21.792
Uh, I am-I am a remarkably

29:21.827 --> 29:23.827
terrible dancer.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.931
What?

29:27.966 --> 29:29.933
I can't change
my life overnight,

29:29.968 --> 29:31.201
but you...

29:31.236 --> 29:33.237
you can learn
to dance in a day.

29:35.841 --> 29:39.209
The one-time pad
changes every day.

29:39.244 --> 29:41.845
So you add the numerical value
of the letter you want

29:41.880 --> 29:44.948
to send to the value
of each letter in the code.

29:44.983 --> 29:47.050
For instance,
if you want to say "hello":

29:47.085 --> 29:49.052
H is eight-- the eighth
letter of the alphabet--

29:49.087 --> 29:50.420
E is five, and so on.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.456
NELL:
Then you add the numerical value
of each sequential letter

29:53.491 --> 29:55.559
on the pad.
Example:

29:55.594 --> 29:57.127
H plus J

29:57.162 --> 29:59.830
is eight plus ten, 18.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.332
E plus X, 29.

30:02.367 --> 30:04.901
If the letters are random, it's
impossible to crack the code.

30:04.936 --> 30:07.337
Exactly.
And we're sure
this is today's code?

30:07.372 --> 30:09.973
An hour ago we tried this
on a broadcast from the club.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.908
According to Deeks'
one-time pad,

30:11.943 --> 30:15.345
that translates as
"TEN P LOC T F."

30:15.380 --> 30:17.247
"10:00 p.m.,
location to follow."

30:17.282 --> 30:18.849
That's two hours from now.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.350
Get thee to the armory.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.854
Thanks, Eric.
What's the plan?

30:23.889 --> 30:25.856
Well, the club doesn't open
for another hour,

30:25.891 --> 30:29.560
so we are just gonna
hang out here.

30:31.129 --> 30:33.029
You want a salsa lesson?

30:33.064 --> 30:34.264
Uh, no, no.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.032
I'm-I'm quite all right,
thank you.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.567
It's free. And
I'm very good.

30:37.602 --> 30:38.969
I imagine you're fantastic,

30:39.004 --> 30:40.337
but I'm-I'm good, thank you.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.905
We do have an
hour to kill.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.307
We do. We do have an hour to...

30:44.342 --> 30:46.343
Yeah, no, fine, let's do it.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.645
Oh, my God.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.648
Okay, I'm the girl,
you're the guy.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.016
Put your hands like this.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.951
What, put 'em on your hips?
Mm-hmm.

30:54.986 --> 30:56.119
Just put 'em on there?
Mm-hmm.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.420
All right.
Okay.

30:57.455 --> 30:58.588
Yeah.
Move your hips
with my hips.

30:58.623 --> 30:59.656
Okay.
Go right,

30:59.691 --> 31:00.991
go left.
Yup.

31:01.026 --> 31:01.992
Go right,
Yup.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.527
go left.
This is ridiculous.

31:04.562 --> 31:07.097
No, loosen up.
Move with me.
I'm... I'm trying.

31:07.132 --> 31:09.399
That's it, you got it.
Do I have it?

31:09.434 --> 31:11.301
Go right, go left.
This feels...

31:11.336 --> 31:13.069
Go right,
go left.
...awkwardly intimate.

31:13.104 --> 31:14.104
Go ri...

31:14.139 --> 31:16.139
(door opens)

31:18.410 --> 31:19.676
(clears throat)
Beautiful flowers

31:19.711 --> 31:21.344
for a beautiful girl.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.612
Oh, wow.
Thank you.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.048
Mm.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.017
The dress is lovely.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.020
Yeah. I, um, thought that this
one would be the best, for sure.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.055
Mm-hmm, yeah.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.924
It's perfect on
the shoulders,

31:33.959 --> 31:35.358
I love the open back.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.061
Mm.
Mm?

31:38.096 --> 31:40.130
The straps are a little
uneven, though.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.198
Yeah.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.267
(clears throat)

31:44.302 --> 31:45.468
Left foot, together.
Yeah.

31:45.503 --> 31:47.070
Back, right foot back, together.
Yup.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.271
Left foot forward, together.
Oh, there it is.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.639
Yup.
Right foot back,
together, forward...

31:49.674 --> 31:50.673
Ti-Tight. Loosen
the grip. Just...
I'm trying.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.674
How are you feeling?
I mean, I'm feeling a bit like

31:51.710 --> 31:53.944
David Hasselhoff
on<i> Dancing with the Stars.</i>

31:53.979 --> 31:55.278
No, you're killing it.
Am I?

31:55.313 --> 31:57.047
Next, you're gonna spin me.
I'm gonna spin you.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.248
Under the arm...
Under the arm and then...

31:58.283 --> 32:00.016
...and back to you.
Oh! Mm.

32:00.051 --> 32:01.484
There are some
new high kicks,

32:01.519 --> 32:03.586
but nothing the dress
can't handle.

32:03.621 --> 32:05.188
Good. Okay.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.157
(nervous chuckle)

32:07.192 --> 32:09.092
I think I need
to get ready.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.263
You know, when we dance...
Mm-hmm.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.198
...I feel chemistry.

32:15.233 --> 32:18.001
Oh, we're definitely
in sync.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.137
If we lock the door...

32:21.172 --> 32:23.039
Oh, well, I think that'd be
a terrible idea.

32:23.074 --> 32:24.374
I just did my hair
and my makeup,

32:24.409 --> 32:26.142
and I want everything
to be perfect, you know.

32:26.177 --> 32:28.078
Yeah.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.085
I'll be right here
after the performance.

32:38.289 --> 32:41.291
<i> Hasta luego, mi corazon.</i>

32:49.501 --> 32:52.502
(female voice over receiver
counting in Spanish)

32:59.377 --> 33:03.313
Maple BTW seven, eight.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.548
Maple Street, between
Seventh and Eighth.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.616
There is an alley.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.650
That's the flower district.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.152
It's pretty deserted at night.

33:09.187 --> 33:10.353
Good place to pass off intel.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.389
Or Cuban cigars.

33:12.424 --> 33:13.490
Kensi and Deeks
meeting us down there?

33:13.525 --> 33:15.725
Uh, no.
Hetty wants eyes

33:15.760 --> 33:17.093
on Perez at the club.
(computer beeps)

33:17.128 --> 33:19.396
Oh...
got new security video.

33:24.069 --> 33:26.669
She passes through
security every day.

33:26.704 --> 33:29.305
They check her baggage
for storage devices.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.574
What about that digital camera
we saw her with?

33:31.609 --> 33:33.176
No, she leaves
it in her car.

33:33.211 --> 33:35.078
She'd never be
allowed in with it.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.347
But her sketches
just waltz through.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.051
Fast forward it
to the next day.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.621
And the day after.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.733
Freeze that.

33:56.768 --> 34:00.270
CALLEN: It's a different
bird drawing every day.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.140
Can you zoom in
on that woodpecker?
Mm-hmm.

34:04.175 --> 34:07.044
I believe that's a sapsucker.

34:09.114 --> 34:11.347
Can you remove the colors?

34:11.382 --> 34:12.782
Piece of cake.

34:12.817 --> 34:14.517
Take out the red.
Mm-hmm.

34:14.552 --> 34:18.155
Take out the green...
the blue.

34:23.328 --> 34:25.796
CALLEN:
Connect the dots.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.201
Hidden in the wings
of a bird.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.737
She works till midnight.
Let's go.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.210
She said she had a fever.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.211
And what time
did she leave?

34:41.246 --> 34:42.145
An hour ago, maybe two.

34:42.180 --> 34:43.814
Right here.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.622
What was on the wall?

34:52.657 --> 34:54.190
Her bird drawings.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.191
SAM:
Thanks for your help.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.794
Thank you.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.629
Every one of those drawings had
a different schematic.

34:59.664 --> 35:00.630
She could have
transferred her plans

35:00.665 --> 35:01.631
for the nuclear submarine.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.800
Within an hour,
they could be in enemy hands.

35:18.950 --> 35:19.916
Anteater?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.318
Tapir?

35:22.353 --> 35:24.654
(chuckles)

35:24.689 --> 35:26.489
It's actually something
a little more rare

35:26.524 --> 35:27.423
with a long nose.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.892
Mr. Snuffleupagus?

35:28.927 --> 35:31.361
It's a Cuban solenodon.

35:32.830 --> 35:33.796
No such thing.

35:33.831 --> 35:36.266
From 1890 to 1970,

35:36.301 --> 35:39.169
they hadn't seen any--
they were declared extinct.

35:39.204 --> 35:42.139
Then, about four years later,
they found three in the wild.

35:43.508 --> 35:44.574
It's an amazing story.

35:44.609 --> 35:47.577
Are you familiar with
the expression "get a life"?

35:47.612 --> 35:50.480
I watch nature shows
with Kamran, all right?

35:50.515 --> 35:52.282
That's one of the benefits
of having kids.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.451
(vehicle approaching)

36:11.970 --> 36:13.536
Two Asian males.

36:13.571 --> 36:14.771
SAM:
Probably the buyers.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.973
But who's selling?

36:17.008 --> 36:18.608
We're tracking
Alonzo's car.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.210
NELL:
He's about a block away.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.645
CALLEN: So the good doctor
is moonlighting.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.481
That whole engagement ring thing
was a big show.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.584
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.419
Maybe they are
really in love.

36:29.454 --> 36:32.355
Gonna run off, live
happily ever after.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.590
Yeah, okay.

36:43.901 --> 36:46.469
We're good. Go.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.007
All clear.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.243
He's got one guy for protection.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.445
With some serious
firepower.

36:57.448 --> 36:59.449
It looks like
Rebecca's portfolio.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.651
They say art's
a good investment.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.692
(Latin dance music playing)

37:09.727 --> 37:11.561
¶ ¶

37:11.596 --> 37:12.629
Hey.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.464
Zanya told me

37:14.499 --> 37:15.899
she saw you in the storeroom.

37:18.002 --> 37:19.936
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):

37:43.661 --> 37:45.562
(shouting):
Federal agents!

37:57.642 --> 38:00.710
SAM: Come out, Alonzo!
Put your hands over your head.

38:04.482 --> 38:07.484
¶ ¶

38:11.055 --> 38:13.056
(crowd cheering)

38:19.664 --> 38:21.765
(speaking Spanish)

38:22.900 --> 38:24.834
What a waste.

38:29.774 --> 38:30.707
We got to flank him.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.642
Not enough cover.

38:35.513 --> 38:36.746
(gunfire continues)

38:36.781 --> 38:37.814
Look up.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.752
It's worth a try.

38:46.791 --> 38:48.525
Ah!

38:55.933 --> 38:57.600
There's got to be
$4 million here.

38:57.635 --> 38:59.836
There's got to be hundreds
of these bird drawings.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.004
(loud thuds)

39:02.039 --> 39:03.773
Cover me.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.887
Guess she wasn't the one.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.689
¶ ¶

39:22.760 --> 39:24.927
(cheering)

39:24.962 --> 39:25.928
KENSI:
Deeks, he's got a knife.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.397
On my way.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.001
I know exactly
who you are.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.803
No shot.

39:33.838 --> 39:34.938
No problem.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.608
(crying out)

39:40.711 --> 39:42.612
(music ends, crowd exclaiming)

39:45.750 --> 39:47.617
(whistles)

39:47.652 --> 39:49.552
Nice work, partner.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.821
I guess I should, uh,

39:51.856 --> 39:53.189
just get back to my tip jar.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.658
And just for me,
you should probably

39:55.693 --> 39:57.060
hang out in that red dress.

40:00.965 --> 40:03.699
It's just a flesh wound, Perez.
DEEKS:
Painful.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.469
Hmm, looks like we
missed a big show.

40:06.504 --> 40:07.703
Well, it was epic.

40:07.738 --> 40:08.871
Now available streaming

40:08.906 --> 40:10.440
on your local
security hard drive.

40:10.475 --> 40:11.974
Maybe we could pop
some popcorn,

40:12.009 --> 40:13.009
make it a movie night.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.844
Or we can stop
talking about it.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.647
What I want to know is
how Alonzo got to Rebecca.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.682
Well, it turns out he went
to medical school in Moscow.

40:19.717 --> 40:21.217
And probably received
some additional training

40:21.252 --> 40:23.152
from a certain
three-letter agency.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.688
So he's a doctor and a spy.
That's a good cover.

40:25.723 --> 40:28.724
Yeah, after 2001,
he became a free agent.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.827
Used his skills
for personal gain.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.528
And she took the bait. Wow.

40:32.563 --> 40:33.963
He played her
like a cheap fiddle.

40:33.998 --> 40:36.232
You mean like a fiddle.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.633
What?

40:37.668 --> 40:39.068
You play someone like a fiddle,

40:39.103 --> 40:40.803
you're all over someone
like a cheap suit.

40:40.838 --> 40:43.039
No, you're all over somebody
like white on rice,

40:43.074 --> 40:43.906
like mud on a pig...
Right.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.942
...like mustard on a hot dog.
Exactly.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.944
Yeah, what happened
to the, uh...

40:47.979 --> 40:49.178
that word count thing
you were doing, huh?

40:49.213 --> 40:50.847
Yeah, the game's over
when the case is closed.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.048
(shouts)

40:52.083 --> 40:54.817
14,960.<i> What?</i>

40:54.852 --> 40:56.686
Ha! That is more
than double

40:56.721 --> 40:58.554
the average male,
thank you very much.

40:58.589 --> 40:59.822
And my number is...

40:59.857 --> 41:00.990
Yeah, what do you got?

41:01.025 --> 41:03.559
Wait...
Something wrong?

41:03.594 --> 41:05.795
...uh...um,
it's not a number.

41:05.830 --> 41:08.898
It's, um, seven
two-digit numbers.

41:08.933 --> 41:10.099
Maybe you got hacked
by the Russians.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.534
(chuckles)

41:11.569 --> 41:12.502
I don't know, this is crazy.

41:12.537 --> 41:13.736
Maybe you should try
that one-time pad thing.

41:13.771 --> 41:16.005
No, no, no, Sam was a mathlete,
he can do it in his head.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.573
All right, go ahead.

41:17.608 --> 41:20.042
Math-a-lete.
Math-a-lete.
Let's see what you got.

41:20.077 --> 41:23.846
W-i-l-l...

41:23.881 --> 41:24.947
KENSI: Mm-hmm.

41:24.982 --> 41:28.651
Y-o-u.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.854
"Will you."
SAM: Will you.

41:31.889 --> 41:33.022
Will you...
Will you what?

41:33.057 --> 41:34.757
Will you dance with me?

41:34.792 --> 41:36.893
Oh, honey, no.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.594
I've had enough
for today, but thank you.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.695
All right, come on, baby,
seriously.

41:39.730 --> 41:40.963
No, I don't want
to dance with you.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.032
I really don't feel like...
(Latin music starts)

41:43.067 --> 41:44.600
That's our cue to leave.
Yeah, I think so.

41:44.635 --> 41:45.601
Good night, folks.

41:45.636 --> 41:46.903
See you, guys.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.104
Last time, you broke
my metatarsal.

41:48.139 --> 41:50.306
Come on, baby, dance with me.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.908
(laughs)

41:51.943 --> 41:53.576
Don't laugh at me, 'cause
I need to concentrate.

41:53.611 --> 41:54.944
It's very hard
not to laugh at you.
I need to concentrate.

41:54.979 --> 41:56.812
Five, six, seven...

41:56.847 --> 41:58.581
Huh?

41:58.616 --> 42:00.550
Oh, he's got rhythm.

42:00.585 --> 42:02.218
By the way,
the word challenge thing,

42:02.253 --> 42:03.286
you definitely won that.

42:03.321 --> 42:04.820
Not surprising.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.122
Want to go
best of three?

42:06.157 --> 42:08.257
If you want to keep losing.

42:08.292 --> 42:09.592
What happened to my app?

42:09.627 --> 42:11.294
A little help
from the meerkats in Ops.

42:11.329 --> 42:13.763
Oh, yeah, see, they were
supposed to remain neutral.

42:13.798 --> 42:14.864
You kidding me?
A couple of gift cards

42:14.899 --> 42:17.066
from Dave & Busters,
they snap like peanut brittle.

42:17.101 --> 42:18.634
What do you--
Oh!
Spin.

42:18.669 --> 42:20.736
¶ ¶

42:20.771 --> 42:21.670
Where did you learn<i> that?</i>

42:21.706 --> 42:23.873
Oh, you know, I took
a couple of lessons

42:23.908 --> 42:25.908
from our boy Victor.
From Victor?

42:25.943 --> 42:27.209
Yeah, I know,
it sounds awkward,

42:27.244 --> 42:29.245
but it's totally worth it
for the big finish.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.947
Okay, but...
Ooh!

42:31.949 --> 42:33.916
(Deeks cries out)

42:33.951 --> 42:36.252
<i> Ugh, Charley horse.</i>
<i> Charley horse!</i>

42:36.287 --> 42:37.753
(thud)
KENSI:<i> Deeks!</i>
