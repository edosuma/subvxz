WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:01.651
<i>Previous on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.785 --> 00:03.852
I put Gallo away
for racketeering.

00:04.609 --> 00:06.209
But that's not what
he really did.

00:06.244 --> 00:07.477
What are you talking about?

00:07.512 --> 00:10.113
We had him for conspiracy
to commit murder,

00:10.148 --> 00:11.648
and the police let the tape

00:11.683 --> 00:13.917
of that bastard admitting
that he did it

00:13.952 --> 00:15.919
out of the chain of custody
for 20 minutes.

00:15.954 --> 00:17.687
You had an alibi witness,

00:17.722 --> 00:19.362
and your public defender
let her get away?

00:19.391 --> 00:20.657
That's what I've been saying!

00:20.692 --> 00:21.991
I didn't have
an alibi witness.

00:22.027 --> 00:23.927
I had a no-show who
vanished into thin air.

00:23.962 --> 00:25.439
Well, you could've
asked for postponement

00:25.463 --> 00:26.829
to have time to find her.

00:26.865 --> 00:28.631
And I would have,
except for one thing:

00:28.667 --> 00:30.311
when I pressed her as to what
the two of them were doing

00:30.335 --> 00:31.479
at the time of those murders,

00:31.503 --> 00:33.169
she admitted they
were both on meth.

00:33.204 --> 00:34.637
<i>Gallo's filing came back,</i>

00:34.673 --> 00:36.617
and it needs to be filed by
his attorney of record.

00:36.641 --> 00:38.675
You want me to represent
that animal?

00:38.710 --> 00:39.676
Kind of funny, isn't it?

00:39.711 --> 00:40.977
You fighting to get me out

00:41.012 --> 00:42.912
when you fought so hard
to put me away.

00:42.948 --> 00:44.314
It makes me sick
to my stomach,

00:44.349 --> 00:46.115
but you're gonna give me
something in return.

00:46.151 --> 00:48.318
Not only are you gonna
keep your hands off Mike,

00:48.353 --> 00:50.219
you're gonna be his
personal protector in here.

00:50.255 --> 00:51.455
You kept my wife
out of prison.

00:51.489 --> 00:53.323
As far as I'm concerned,
that makes us square.

00:53.358 --> 00:54.324
<i>Harvey and Mike did it,</i>

00:54.359 --> 00:55.992
which means Mike's coming home.

00:56.027 --> 00:57.560
Oh, my God.

00:57.596 --> 00:58.761
Joshua called.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.163
He's coming to town tomorrow.

01:00.198 --> 01:01.164
Are you gonna
break up with him?

01:01.199 --> 01:02.265
I don't know.

01:06.471 --> 01:08.471
I really appreciate
you doing this.

01:08.506 --> 01:11.341
If you weren't with me,

01:11.376 --> 01:13.343
I can't imagine how I'd handle

01:13.378 --> 01:15.912
whether or not Tara is
breaking up with Joshua.

01:15.947 --> 01:18.314
Joshua--what is he?

01:18.350 --> 01:19.983
Lord of the Kingdom
of Dicken-stein,

01:20.018 --> 01:24.153
reigning over his subjects from
high atop Douche Mountain?

01:24.189 --> 01:25.688
Anyway, thanks for being here.

01:25.724 --> 01:27.101
Aside from Tara, you're the most
important woman

01:27.125 --> 01:28.324
in my entire life.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.326
Oh, my God, Louis.

01:30.362 --> 01:33.162
Mudding is...

01:33.198 --> 01:36.099
amazing.

01:36.134 --> 01:38.368
I actually just fell asleep
for the last half hour.

01:38.403 --> 01:39.669
Goddamn it, Donna.

01:39.704 --> 01:41.182
I didn't bring you here
so you could fall asleep

01:41.206 --> 01:42.416
while I'm pouring my heart out.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.073
You're the most selfish
woman I ever met.

01:44.109 --> 01:46.087
I thought you just told me
I was the most important

01:46.111 --> 01:48.311
non-Tara woman in your life.

01:48.346 --> 01:50.179
Wait a second.
I thought you just fell asleep.

01:50.215 --> 01:51.581
And for the last
thirty seconds,

01:51.616 --> 01:54.183
have you been mad at me
or upset about Joshua?

01:54.219 --> 01:55.618
Holy shit, you're a genius.

01:55.654 --> 01:58.054
Which is why when we get
back to the office,

01:58.089 --> 02:02.025
you're reconciling everyone's
billings for the last six weeks.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.793
Oh, Donna, that is
the worst form of torture

02:03.828 --> 02:04.927
I can go through.

02:04.963 --> 02:06.562
No, Louis, the worst
form of torture

02:06.598 --> 02:08.464
is what you'll do if you
don't have something

02:08.500 --> 02:10.699
to occupy your mind.

02:10.735 --> 02:12.235
Oh, my God, you're right.

02:12.270 --> 02:13.569
I don't care what the cost

02:13.605 --> 02:15.571
or that I'm entirely naked
underneath this mud.

02:15.607 --> 02:16.873
I'm getting us another hour.

02:16.908 --> 02:19.075
Louis, you are not moving
another centimeter

02:19.110 --> 02:20.410
until Renaldo comes back in here

02:20.445 --> 02:22.211
and puts that privacy curtain
back up.

02:24.582 --> 02:26.249
Oh, look who's here.

02:26.284 --> 02:27.828
I'm not supposed to get out
till this afternoon,

02:27.852 --> 02:28.818
but leave it to you to--

02:28.853 --> 02:30.586
Mike, sit down.

02:30.622 --> 02:31.622
Okay.

02:35.493 --> 02:36.859
What's going on?

02:36.895 --> 02:39.106
Cahill called and said there
was a problem with your release.

02:39.130 --> 02:41.409
It's not a big deal, but it's
just gonna take a little longer.

02:41.433 --> 02:42.732
- How much longer?
- A few days.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.167
Harvey, I informed on someone.

02:44.202 --> 02:45.312
If word gets out about that--

02:45.336 --> 02:46.602
You think I don't know that?

02:46.638 --> 02:49.605
But he pulled your deal
then reinstated it.

02:49.641 --> 02:51.074
It's gonna take a little time.

02:51.109 --> 02:52.687
Well, what the hell am I
supposed to do in the meantime?

02:52.711 --> 02:54.410
Sit tight, and keep
your wits about you.

02:54.446 --> 02:55.945
You made it this long.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.747
You can make it a few more days.

03:00.285 --> 03:01.517
Does Rachel know about this?

03:01.553 --> 03:03.920
Look, she didn't know it was
gonna take this long

03:03.955 --> 03:05.755
in the first place,

03:05.790 --> 03:08.157
and I didn't see the need
to tell her now.

03:08.193 --> 03:10.393
Do me a favor, and let's
keep it that way.

03:13.364 --> 03:15.431
Rachel, good morning.

03:15.467 --> 03:16.866
I was looking for you before.

03:16.901 --> 03:19.435
I wanted to say congratulations
on getting Mike out.

03:19.471 --> 03:20.970
I appreciate that.

03:21.005 --> 03:23.439
But we have some
other good news.

03:23.475 --> 03:26.876
We may be on our way to getting
Leonard Bailey out too.

03:26.911 --> 03:28.811
Did you figure out a way
to reopen the trial?

03:28.847 --> 03:30.313
I did.

03:33.518 --> 03:35.318
Rachel, this is good
in theory,

03:35.353 --> 03:36.619
but there's no precedent.

03:36.654 --> 03:37.887
Yes, there is.

03:37.922 --> 03:41.224
Turner versus
the State of Michigan.

03:41.259 --> 03:42.459
How the hell did
you find that?

03:42.494 --> 03:45.128
It turns out being
a paralegal for so long

03:45.163 --> 03:46.562
was a blessing in disguise,

03:46.598 --> 03:48.998
because nobody is better
at research than me.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.366
Great. Write up a declaration,

03:50.401 --> 03:51.912
and get it to me
as soon as you're done.

03:51.936 --> 03:53.669
And I'll get this thing rolling.

03:53.705 --> 03:55.872
Jessica, I thought I'd
be the one to do it.

03:55.907 --> 03:57.807
Rachel, you're not
a lawyer yet.

03:57.842 --> 03:59.075
I don't need to be.

03:59.110 --> 04:01.277
She's his public defender.
She'll do this for us.

04:01.312 --> 04:03.846
Listen to me--sometimes things
don't go exactly as planned.

04:03.882 --> 04:06.449
And nobody is better
at research than you,

04:06.484 --> 04:09.952
but nobody is better at dropping
the hammer than me.

04:13.525 --> 04:14.735
Listen to me, I'm gonna ask
you a question,

04:14.759 --> 04:15.958
and I need to know the truth.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.593
You know about this Cahill shit?

04:17.629 --> 04:18.894
What Cahill shit?

04:18.930 --> 04:20.541
Apparently Sutter wasn't
enough for that asshole,

04:20.565 --> 04:22.732
because he's been seizing
our assets left and right.

04:22.767 --> 04:23.878
You really think they
were gonna let her

04:23.902 --> 04:25.835
keep direct proceeds
from insider trading?

04:25.870 --> 04:27.281
I'm not talking
about direct proceeds.

04:27.305 --> 04:28.745
I'm talking about
everything we have.

04:28.773 --> 04:29.839
- What?
- Yeah,

04:29.874 --> 04:31.107
including money she earned

04:31.142 --> 04:32.887
before she ever got wrapped up
in that bullshit.

04:32.911 --> 04:33.976
They can't do that.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.211
Well, they're doing it.

04:35.246 --> 04:36.690
And I don't care whether
you do something about it

04:36.714 --> 04:38.481
from in here or when
you get out there,

04:38.516 --> 04:40.427
but you're the one who convinced
us to take this deal, Mike,

04:40.451 --> 04:42.252
so you better damn well
be the one to stop it.

Hey, Counselor.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.453
You didn't forget about me,
did you?

05:20.489 --> 05:22.355
Your hearing's
tomorrow at 2:00.

05:22.391 --> 05:23.556
I sent you the paperwork.

05:23.592 --> 05:25.458
Right under the wire.

05:25.494 --> 05:26.760
Cutting it close, huh?

05:26.795 --> 05:29.496
I said I'd get it done,
and it's done, Gallo.

05:29.531 --> 05:31.998
Now I'm leaving.
So soon?

05:32.033 --> 05:34.234
I thought you might want
to meet and chat strategy.

05:34.269 --> 05:37.370
My strategy is for you to get
your parole tomorrow

05:37.406 --> 05:40.573
and then burn your existence
from my brain.

05:40.609 --> 05:41.919
I don't think I like the way
you just spoke

05:41.943 --> 05:43.543
to your own client, Harvey.

05:43.578 --> 05:45.111
You better come through.

05:45.147 --> 05:46.446
I'll come through, Gallo,

05:46.481 --> 05:48.281
but you better remember
your part of the deal.

05:48.316 --> 05:49.949
What, protecting Mike?

05:49.985 --> 05:52.352
What does Mike need protecting
for if I'm cool with him?

05:52.387 --> 05:53.387
Save your bullshit.

05:53.422 --> 05:55.488
I know you know
Mike was informing.

05:55.524 --> 05:57.624
Yeah, I also know William
Sutter's going away,

05:57.659 --> 05:58.899
which means Mike's getting out.

05:58.927 --> 06:00.160
Well, he's not out yet,

06:00.195 --> 06:01.595
so while you're both
still in there,

06:01.630 --> 06:03.963
you don't take your
eyes off him.

06:03.999 --> 06:06.800
I'm nothing if not
a man of my word.

06:06.835 --> 06:08.601
Oh, and Harvey,
I don't want to stand

06:08.637 --> 06:10.236
of the parole board
wearing this,

06:10.272 --> 06:12.772
so bring me something
nice to wear.

06:12.808 --> 06:14.841
I was a 38 slim
when I came in.

06:14.876 --> 06:16.676
Now I'm more like a 40 reg.

06:16.711 --> 06:19.078
I'll leave it up to you;
you're the dandy.

06:22.284 --> 06:23.249
<i>This is Sean Cahill.</i>

06:23.285 --> 06:24.584
Well, Sean, this is Mike Ross.

06:24.619 --> 06:25.885
<i>What can I do for you, Mike?</i>

06:25.921 --> 06:27.098
You can tell me why the hell
you're going after

06:27.122 --> 06:28.521
Jill Miller's assets.

06:28.557 --> 06:30.234
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
you were her accountant.

06:30.258 --> 06:31.424
<i>Well, if you don't back off,</i>

06:31.460 --> 06:33.059
I'm about to become
her goddamn lawyer.

06:33.094 --> 06:35.662
<i>- Excuse me?</i>
- That wasn't part of her deal.

06:35.697 --> 06:37.481
No, it wasn't, but I'm not
gonna let her keep

06:37.482 --> 06:39.082
her money she made
committing a crime.

06:39.117 --> 06:41.217
You're not just taking money
she made from a crime.

06:41.253 --> 06:42.497
You're taking
the salary she made

06:42.521 --> 06:44.120
from working at that company
for years.

06:44.156 --> 06:46.289
Listen, that woman got out
of going to prison.

06:46.517 --> 06:47.673
But every time they took
a position,

06:47.674 --> 06:48.840
they sold the other side

06:48.876 --> 06:50.408
to people who lost everything.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.388
And I'll be damned if I
let her live high on the hog

06:52.412 --> 06:54.346
while working people's
lives were ruined.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.515
Sean, I know about
your mother and Spain.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.919
But Jill Miller didn't
take her money.

07:00.954 --> 07:01.920
I don't care.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.255
I have the power to do this.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.891
And this conversation is over.

07:11.666 --> 07:13.532
Jessica Pierson.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.301
My secretary should've told you
I'm not taking new clients.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.037
I take it you know
why I'm here.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.072
I tried to be polite when your
protégé accused me

07:21.108 --> 07:23.208
of not doing my job
with Leonard Bailey.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.510
But I'm not gonna be told by
someone who harbored a fraud

07:25.545 --> 07:26.878
what a bad lawyer I am.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.747
I don't think you're
a bad lawyer, Georgina.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.916
I think you're a good lawyer
that made a mistake.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.751
And I'm here to give you
a chance to fix it.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.852
And how's that?

07:33.887 --> 07:36.554
Leonard Bailey's
alibi witness is dead.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.323
That doesn't mean
her testimony is.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.892
You want me to testify
to what she told me?

07:40.928 --> 07:41.960
That would be hearsay.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.328
It would be if she were alive.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.663
But now that she's dead...

07:44.698 --> 07:46.464
She's an unavailable
declarant.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.533
Like I said,
you are a good lawyer.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.603
And I'm not pretending I let
a solid witness disappear

07:51.638 --> 07:53.238
when that girl was a junkie

07:53.273 --> 07:55.340
and her story was
inconsistent at best.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.120
And it still should've been
presented to a jury,

07:57.144 --> 07:58.610
which is what we're
trying to fix.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.723
The only thing you're trying
to fix is your reputation.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.214
And you're not doing it
by smearing mine.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.784
Georgina, a man's life
is on the line.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.552
And I did my best
to defend it,

08:07.587 --> 08:09.521
but I have no obligation
to do it again.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.156
That's where you're wrong.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.893
My protégé took the liberty of
drawing up a sworn affidavit

08:14.928 --> 08:16.828
which states Maria Gomez
told you

08:16.863 --> 08:18.676
Leonard Bailey couldn't have
murdered that couple

08:18.700 --> 08:20.266
because he was with
her at the time.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.700
Now you can either sign it,

08:21.735 --> 08:24.903
or you lie under oath
that this isn't true.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.539
And believe you me, you do not
want to be on that stand

08:27.574 --> 08:30.375
lying to a jury
and have to face me.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.615
Donna, cancel all
my meetings tomorrow,

08:37.652 --> 08:39.585
and notify the parole board
that Gallo's ready.

08:39.619 --> 08:40.996
- Harvey--
- I don't want to hear it.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.087
Listen to me.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.700
I was there with you
when you put him away,

08:43.724 --> 08:45.234
and I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

08:45.258 --> 08:47.370
if I didn't remind you what you
said about him at the time.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.493
I don't need reminding.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.762
You said he was a sociopath

08:49.796 --> 08:51.329
who took pleasure
from hurting people.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.664
Donna, I don't have a choice.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.266
That was before you knew
that Mike was getting out.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.180
If you just string him along
for a couple more hours--

08:57.204 --> 08:58.937
Mike's not getting out today.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.271
What?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.539
Cahill called me.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.553
The deal's gonna take a few
more days to go through.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.254
And if Gallo even thinks that
I'm stringing him along,

09:05.278 --> 09:08.013
Mike may never get out
of there at all.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.347
I'll clear your schedule.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.989
Hey, I need to talk to you.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.302
Before you do, I just
want to say

09:19.326 --> 09:20.503
I didn't mean to put it
all on you earlier.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.804
No, that doesn't matter now.
Listen.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.039
You said that when
you got arrested,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.597
you turned down a deal
to turn on Sutter.

09:25.632 --> 09:28.133
I need to know exactly
what they said.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.201
I don't understand what
that has to do with Jill.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.569
It doesn't.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.845
It has to do with the fact that

09:32.873 --> 09:34.372
I'm trying to get
you out of here.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.473
What?

09:35.509 --> 09:36.619
I might not be able
to do anything

09:36.643 --> 09:38.276
about the money,
but maybe what I can do

09:38.311 --> 09:41.413
is make it so that you
can be with your family.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.414
No.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.559
- What do you mean, no?
- No.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.694
They're already going
after our money.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.917
I don't want to do anything

09:45.952 --> 09:47.196
that's gonna mess
with Jill's deal.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.965
Listen to me.
That deal is as solid as a rock.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.767
I wrote it myself;
they can't take it away from her

09:50.791 --> 09:52.535
any more than they can take
my deal away from me.

09:52.559 --> 09:55.527
But you need to tell me exactly
what Cahill said to you

09:55.562 --> 09:57.162
when he told you
to turn on Sutter.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.798
Nothing.
He never said anything to me.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.032
What are you talking about?

10:01.068 --> 10:02.245
I'm telling you
I've never spoken

10:02.269 --> 10:04.069
to Sean Cahill in my life.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.239
All right, I'm here.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.475
But I gave you seven days
to find that witness,

10:10.510 --> 10:11.976
and then you went
behind my back,

10:12.012 --> 10:14.212
so you better have a good reason
why you're in here

10:14.247 --> 10:15.647
asking to reopen this case.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.949
We do, Your Honor.
We found Leonard Bailey's alibi.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.717
What they found is
nothing but hearsay.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.952
What is he talking about?

10:20.987 --> 10:23.088
He's talking about the fact
that our eyewitness

10:23.123 --> 10:24.355
died three years ago,

10:24.391 --> 10:25.757
and Mr. Bailey's
original attorney

10:25.792 --> 10:27.525
is going to testify
on her behalf

10:27.561 --> 10:30.595
under the Turner v. Michigan
exception to the hearsay rule.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.064
That exception involved
a written statement.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.944
It is a written statement,
and we have it right here.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.468
That is not
a written statement.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.003
That is a bullshit affidavit she
cobbled together this morning.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.505
What did you just
accuse her of?

10:40.540 --> 10:43.274
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I
find it decidedly convenient

10:43.310 --> 10:44.976
that they don't have
the witness statement

10:45.011 --> 10:48.046
written down on a notebook
or a scrap of paper

10:48.081 --> 10:49.848
from the same decade
that it happened.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.016
Well, we happen to find it
decidedly inconvenient.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.052
And Georgina Casey didn't
write it down at the time

10:54.087 --> 10:55.620
because she didn't do
an adequate job

10:55.655 --> 10:57.322
representing her client.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.258
Are you now saying that this
case needs to be reopened

11:00.293 --> 11:03.161
based on Leonard Bailey having
inadequate representation?

11:03.196 --> 11:05.263
Because that is a serious
allegation to make

11:05.298 --> 11:06.431
about a fellow attorney.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.765
That wasn't our plan.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.068
But if that's what it takes
to give this man a chance

11:10.103 --> 11:11.503
to prove his innocence,

11:11.538 --> 11:13.338
then it sure as hell
is our plan now.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.772
This is ridiculous.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.242
It may sound ridiculous,
but if they were able to get

11:17.277 --> 11:20.645
a successful attorney to admit
to a huge blunder,

11:20.680 --> 11:23.025
then I'm ruling that this case
should be reopened after all.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.854
Cameron, what are
you doing here?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.033
You know what I'm doing here.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.201
Are you out of your goddamn mind

11:32.225 --> 11:33.625
representing Frank Gallo?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.304
- You don't understand.
- I understand plenty.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.739
- No, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.207
That guy was a murdering
piece of shit

11:38.231 --> 11:39.375
who should've been
put away for life,

11:39.399 --> 11:40.443
and now you're trying
to get him out?

11:40.467 --> 11:41.799
He's in there with Mike Ross.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.268
I don't care.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.336
Well, I do, because
like you just said,

11:45.372 --> 11:46.838
he is a murdering piece of shit.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.940
But what you don't know is,
I made a deal with him,

11:48.975 --> 11:50.108
and I'm not gonna break it.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.576
- Then I will.
- It's not up to you.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.178
Well, it will be

11:53.213 --> 11:54.913
when I play this for
the parole board.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.114
What is that?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.682
It's the tape we had
of him admitting

11:57.717 --> 11:59.984
that he murdered that man
that you shit the bed with

12:00.020 --> 12:01.653
and got excluded from evidence.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.566
I didn't shit the bed with
anything, and you know it.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.390
You try to bring that bullshit
to his hearing,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.026
I'll march you out of there
before you get to hit play,

12:08.061 --> 12:09.561
'cause it wasn't
admissible in court,

12:09.596 --> 12:10.773
and it's not admissible there.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.330
You tell yourself
whatever you want,

12:12.365 --> 12:13.998
but I'm gonna do whatever
I need to do

12:14.034 --> 12:16.100
to keep that bastard
behind bars.

12:23.752 --> 12:24.652
Talk to you a second?

12:24.687 --> 12:25.653
Of course.

12:25.688 --> 12:26.654
You were right.

12:26.689 --> 12:28.022
The whole time I was working,

12:28.057 --> 12:30.758
I didn't worry about what
Tara was doing with...

12:30.793 --> 12:32.893
him, which meant the first
time in my life,

12:32.929 --> 12:34.528
I finished the billables
in record time.

12:34.564 --> 12:35.963
And now you're
afraid to go home.

12:35.998 --> 12:38.399
I can't help wondering
what's happening.

12:38.434 --> 12:41.168
Louis, have you ever
heard of a jack story?

12:41.203 --> 12:44.271
- No.
- Well, it's time you did.

12:44.307 --> 12:47.374
A man gets a flat tire
on a country road.

12:47.410 --> 12:49.143
He sees a house in the distance.

12:49.178 --> 12:50.689
He walks up to the house,
and along the way,

12:50.713 --> 12:52.947
he starts thinking, "What if
they don't have a jack?

12:52.982 --> 12:54.181
"What if they have a jack,

12:54.216 --> 12:55.761
"but they want to charge me
for it, and if they do,

12:55.785 --> 12:56.862
"how much would they charge?

12:56.886 --> 12:59.086
$100, $200, $1,000?"

12:59.121 --> 13:00.654
- That's bullshit.
- Exactly.

13:00.690 --> 13:02.100
So by the time the man
gets to the house,

13:02.124 --> 13:03.602
rings the bell, and they
answer the door,

13:03.626 --> 13:04.826
he tells them, "You know what?

13:04.860 --> 13:07.094
Keep your goddamn jack."

13:07.129 --> 13:09.129
- That's brilliant.
- So you get my point.

13:09.165 --> 13:10.864
No.

13:10.900 --> 13:13.701
Louis, you have no idea
what's going on in Tara's mind,

13:13.736 --> 13:16.570
so the best thing you can do
is trust her.

13:16.606 --> 13:18.472
Because if you don't,
I'm telling you,

13:18.507 --> 13:19.985
you're gonna do something
that you'll regret

13:20.009 --> 13:21.775
for the rest of your life.

13:21.811 --> 13:24.545
All right, Donna.

13:24.580 --> 13:25.946
I'll wait for Tara to call.

13:25.982 --> 13:27.581
Okay.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:36.392 --> 13:37.658
Can I help you?

13:37.693 --> 13:38.726
Help me what, rat?

13:38.761 --> 13:40.427
What did you just say?

13:40.463 --> 13:44.531
I said you ratted
on your own roommate.

13:44.567 --> 13:48.102
Word's spreading, and there's
going to come a time when

13:48.137 --> 13:51.038
you need my protection,
and I won't be there.

13:51.073 --> 13:55.509
Hey, what's going on here?

13:55.544 --> 13:56.744
Nothing.

13:56.779 --> 14:00.514
It's not nothing.
You were threatening him.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.994
You ever do it again
without my say so,

14:02.018 --> 14:04.251
you'll regret the day
you met me.

14:04.286 --> 14:07.154
Sorry, Frank.

14:09.692 --> 14:12.626
Don't worry about it, kid.
I got your back.

14:12.662 --> 14:14.395
No, you don't.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.163
Everyone knows guards
are the last one

14:16.198 --> 14:17.398
to find out anything.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.033
So if word were spreading,

14:19.068 --> 14:21.168
I wouldn't be finding out
about it from him.

14:21.203 --> 14:22.936
He just did that because
you told him to,

14:22.972 --> 14:24.816
because you want to remind me
of what's gonna happen

14:24.840 --> 14:27.474
if Harvey lets you down.

14:27.510 --> 14:31.578
Well, then, I guess you got
the message loud and clear.

14:31.614 --> 14:35.049
Good luck to me on my
hearing tomorrow.

14:43.025 --> 14:44.825
Did you do what
I asked you to do?

14:44.860 --> 14:46.126
- I did.
- You better.

14:46.162 --> 14:47.572
Because if you don't sound
like a human being,

14:47.596 --> 14:50.431
you're gonna be in here
for another two years.

14:50.466 --> 14:53.567
The hell is Cameron Dennis
doing here?

14:53.602 --> 14:55.035
You let me worry about him.

14:55.071 --> 14:57.337
Mr. Specter, please proceed.

15:01.177 --> 15:02.876
Ladies and gentlemen
of the board,

15:02.912 --> 15:05.579
Mr. Gallo has served 12 years

15:05.614 --> 15:07.214
as an exemplary inmate.

15:07.249 --> 15:10.751
We ask that you release him so
he can continue to live his life

15:10.786 --> 15:12.352
outside these walls.

15:12.388 --> 15:14.321
But before you decide on that,

15:14.356 --> 15:17.524
we think it's best if you
hear from him in his own words.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.460
You son of a bitch,
what the hell is this?

15:19.495 --> 15:21.962
It's an action on behalf
of my client, Kevin Miller.

15:21.997 --> 15:24.465
You abused your power when you
went after him last year.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.566
I didn't abuse shit.

15:25.601 --> 15:26.767
I beg to differ.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.969
'Cause not only does Kevin
live in New Jersey,

15:29.004 --> 15:30.182
but his accident was there too,

15:30.206 --> 15:32.239
were means you were outside
of your jurisdiction.

15:32.274 --> 15:34.219
You better rescind this suit,
because if they come after me--

15:34.243 --> 15:35.821
They're not gonna come after
you, Sean, because I haven't

15:35.845 --> 15:37.211
filed it yet.

15:37.246 --> 15:41.181
And I'm not going to, as long as
you agree to get Kevin out.

15:41.217 --> 15:42.716
Are you crazy?

15:42.752 --> 15:44.051
I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?

15:44.086 --> 15:45.464
'Cause I'm not gonna
get held hostage

15:45.488 --> 15:46.787
by the likes of you.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.388
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

15:48.424 --> 15:51.358
I'm not denying
the person I was

15:51.393 --> 15:52.693
or the things I did,

15:52.728 --> 15:55.329
because I did those things.

15:55.364 --> 15:57.865
If I could go back
and change what I did,

15:57.900 --> 15:59.666
I would, but I can't.

15:59.702 --> 16:02.136
What I can do is swear to you

16:02.171 --> 16:05.239
that I will never go back
to being that person again.

16:05.274 --> 16:07.085
You crossed the line when
you took Jill's money.

16:07.109 --> 16:09.209
No, Mike, I didn't,
but I'm about to cross it now.

16:09.245 --> 16:11.378
You want to see abuse of power?
Your deal is gone.

16:11.413 --> 16:13.080
If there are no
other statements--

16:13.115 --> 16:15.516
Matter of fact, I would, uh,
like to say a few words.

16:15.551 --> 16:17.851
- And you are?
- Cameron Dennis.

16:17.887 --> 16:21.555
I was the district attorney at
the time of Mr. Gallo's trial.

16:21.590 --> 16:25.159
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Dennis
is about to play a tape

16:25.194 --> 16:26.360
from the original trial.

16:26.395 --> 16:28.095
It wasn't admissible then,

16:28.130 --> 16:29.429
and it's not admissible now.

16:29.465 --> 16:31.398
No, Harvey, I'm going
to read the transcript

16:31.433 --> 16:35.068
of your own words from
Mr. Gallo's sentencing hearing.

16:35.104 --> 16:37.404
"Frank Gallo is the scum
of the Earth.

16:37.439 --> 16:40.374
"He's a sociopath
who has no remorse

16:40.409 --> 16:42.543
"for the things he's done,
and he is an animal

16:42.578 --> 16:45.445
who deserves to be locked up for
the rest of his miserable life."

16:45.481 --> 16:47.247
I gave you immunity
for crimes you committed

16:47.283 --> 16:48.715
before you got caught.

16:48.751 --> 16:51.062
But your plea agreement says
you'll never practice law again

16:51.086 --> 16:52.152
without a license.

16:52.188 --> 16:53.153
You've been practicing
law in here,

16:53.189 --> 16:54.354
which means that's a crime

16:54.390 --> 16:55.823
that happened after
you got caught.

16:55.858 --> 16:57.024
Bullshit.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.992
Kevin and Jill both know
that I'm not a lawyer.

16:59.028 --> 17:00.627
You know that
and I know that,

17:00.663 --> 17:02.563
but if you fight it,
I will argue it in court

17:02.598 --> 17:03.897
for the next two years.

17:03.933 --> 17:05.242
And if you don't
drop this thing, you'll be lucky

17:05.267 --> 17:06.545
if they let you out a day before

17:06.569 --> 17:09.102
you were supposed
to get out anyway.

17:09.137 --> 17:11.672
Mr. Chairman,
I'm telling you,

17:11.707 --> 17:13.574
Frank Gallo has changed.

17:13.608 --> 17:15.976
And I'm telling the board
he hasn't changed.

17:16.011 --> 17:17.189
He's just trying
to blackmail you.

17:17.213 --> 17:18.412
That's a lie.

17:18.446 --> 17:20.180
Then take the stand
and swear it's not true.

17:20.215 --> 17:21.615
That's enough.

17:21.650 --> 17:24.351
Mr. Specter, this is a parole
hearing, not a court of law,

17:24.386 --> 17:26.131
but if there's any truth
to what he's saying,

17:26.155 --> 17:28.689
we need to know.

17:28.724 --> 17:30.090
It's not true.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.259
Unfortunately, this body
doesn't have the authority

17:32.294 --> 17:33.738
to swear you in,
but I'm going to make sure

17:33.762 --> 17:36.363
that we will tomorrow.

17:36.398 --> 17:37.809
I'd like you to think
long and hard about

17:37.833 --> 17:39.032
what you're gonna say then,

17:39.068 --> 17:40.734
because you'll be
saying it under oath.

17:47.930 --> 17:50.465
Mike, I need to tell you
what just happened.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.200
I need to tell you
what happened first.

17:58.976 --> 18:01.042
Abuse of power?
Are you nuts?

18:01.078 --> 18:02.277
It's the only play I have.

18:02.312 --> 18:03.723
Your only play is
to walk out of here

18:03.747 --> 18:04.924
when your release comes through,

18:04.948 --> 18:06.681
not threaten the guy
who made that happen.

18:06.717 --> 18:07.882
Listen to me.

18:07.918 --> 18:09.484
Cahill is seizing
their personal assets.

18:09.519 --> 18:11.297
Yeah, I don't care if he
takes their house apart

18:11.321 --> 18:12.854
brick by brick.

18:12.889 --> 18:14.467
Harvey, Kevin wouldn't even
be in here in the first place

18:14.491 --> 18:15.757
if it weren't for Cahill.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.637
No, Mike, Kevin wouldn't
be here if he had chosen

18:17.661 --> 18:19.661
to roll over on Sutter
in the first place.

18:19.696 --> 18:20.873
And it's a good thing he didn't,

18:20.897 --> 18:22.342
because you'd be stuck in here
with Gallo

18:22.366 --> 18:23.331
for the next two years.

18:23.367 --> 18:24.532
I don't care about Gallo.

18:24.568 --> 18:26.468
Well, you should,
because he's not out yet,

18:26.503 --> 18:28.003
and if it's up
to Cameron Dennis,

18:28.038 --> 18:29.704
he's not getting out.

18:31.842 --> 18:33.341
What?

18:33.377 --> 18:36.044
Cameron got wind that I'm
trying to get Gallo parole.

18:36.079 --> 18:37.746
And now I got to think
of something

18:37.781 --> 18:39.247
or perjure myself tomorrow,

18:39.282 --> 18:40.949
or he's gonna end up
right back in here.

18:40.984 --> 18:43.752
Well, that's even more reason
why we can't leave Kevin behind.

18:43.787 --> 18:45.587
If Gallo doesn't get out
and I do,

18:45.622 --> 18:48.423
the first person he's gonna
go after is Kevin.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.492
And I didn't sign on
to get someone killed.

18:50.527 --> 18:53.061
No, you signed on
to get yourself out.

18:53.096 --> 18:54.963
Now if you don't drop this suit,

18:54.998 --> 18:57.165
Cahill's gonna threaten
to pull your deal.

18:59.603 --> 19:01.202
What?

19:01.238 --> 19:02.370
He already did.

19:02.406 --> 19:04.246
Then why are we still
having this conversation?

19:04.274 --> 19:05.852
'Cause like I said,
this is the only card

19:05.876 --> 19:07.542
I have left to play.

19:07.577 --> 19:08.877
So if you want me
to drop this,

19:08.912 --> 19:11.279
you get Cahill to do the right
thing and get Kevin out.

19:15.352 --> 19:17.986
I have to say, for someone
who practices corporate law,

19:18.021 --> 19:20.288
you know your way around
an appeals court.

19:20.323 --> 19:22.590
Thank you, but you're not here
to offer me a job

19:22.626 --> 19:26.695
as a prosecutor, you're here
to offer Leonard Bailey a deal.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.530
So let's get to it.
Let's face it.

19:28.565 --> 19:30.899
You may have that affidavit
from his original attorney,

19:30.934 --> 19:33.501
but you have no DNA, no alibi,

19:33.537 --> 19:36.071
and I'm guess not a hell
of a lot else.

19:36.106 --> 19:37.739
What I have, Larry, is a case

19:37.774 --> 19:39.207
that will embarrass
you personally

19:39.242 --> 19:40.608
every day it drags on,

19:40.644 --> 19:42.822
because you were the one that
tried it in the first place.

19:42.846 --> 19:45.313
So give me a number, so I can
get on with my day.

19:45.348 --> 19:47.982
Bailey does ten more years,
and we all go home.

19:48.018 --> 19:49.617
When you say ten,
you mean nine,

19:49.653 --> 19:51.064
and we both know I can
get you down to seven,

19:51.088 --> 19:53.354
so let's just say five.

19:53.390 --> 19:54.622
But I'll tell you what.

19:54.658 --> 19:57.025
You let my client
walk right now,

19:57.060 --> 19:58.426
and you get your dream.

19:58.462 --> 19:59.728
We don't open this case at all.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.229
No way.

20:01.264 --> 20:02.731
Seven years,
take it or leave it.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.199
Offer's good 24 hours.

20:04.234 --> 20:05.333
No, this is unacceptable.

20:05.368 --> 20:06.512
Well, it's the best
you're gonna do.

20:06.536 --> 20:08.136
No, the best
I'm going to do

20:08.171 --> 20:11.473
is get my client exonerated
from a crime he didn't commit

20:11.508 --> 20:13.141
and make you look like a fool.

20:13.176 --> 20:14.642
Then bring it on.

20:14.678 --> 20:17.779
But you're legally obligated to
present my offer to your client.

20:17.814 --> 20:20.648
And remind him,
if he loses again,

20:20.684 --> 20:23.017
in 60 days his life is over.

20:28.492 --> 20:29.958
Thanks, Bill.

20:29.993 --> 20:32.660
Sean, what's going on
with Mike's deal?

20:32.696 --> 20:34.095
Excuse me?

20:34.131 --> 20:35.864
Why hasn't it
come through yet?

20:35.899 --> 20:37.866
Oh, there must've been
a mix-up in the paperwork.

20:37.901 --> 20:39.968
Bullshit.

20:40.003 --> 20:42.270
You're holding it up because
he's threatening to sue you.

20:42.305 --> 20:44.072
Oh, you're right.
I am.

20:44.107 --> 20:45.918
And if doesn't drop this thing
and agree to walk away,

20:45.942 --> 20:47.709
I'm gonna dump his
deal altogether.

20:47.744 --> 20:50.512
Sean, let his
deal go through.

20:50.547 --> 20:52.987
Once he gets out, he's not gonna
follow through on this thing.

20:53.016 --> 20:55.517
"Oh, Sean, put down your gun.

20:55.552 --> 20:57.318
"I promise Mike'll
put his down too.

20:57.354 --> 20:58.664
"And you can trust
the both of us,

20:58.688 --> 21:00.755
'cause neither of us has ever
lied to you before."

21:00.791 --> 21:02.123
If you didn't trust us,

21:02.159 --> 21:04.125
you never would've come to me
in the first place.

21:04.161 --> 21:05.905
If I had known this is how
it was going to end,

21:05.929 --> 21:06.895
I never would have.

21:06.930 --> 21:07.996
You son of a bitch.

21:08.031 --> 21:09.831
We got you every goddamn
thing you wanted.

21:09.866 --> 21:11.232
I held up my end
of the bargain,

21:11.268 --> 21:13.434
not to mention the fact I gave
immunity to Jill Miller

21:13.470 --> 21:14.702
when I didn't have to.

21:14.738 --> 21:16.004
Bullshit you didn't have to.

21:16.039 --> 21:19.040
She made your case,
and Mike risked his life

21:19.075 --> 21:20.108
to get her for you.

21:20.143 --> 21:22.076
You had no problem asking me

21:22.112 --> 21:23.745
to risk everything
to get that kid out,

21:23.780 --> 21:24.913
and I did it.

21:24.948 --> 21:26.159
And now that ungrateful
son of a bitch

21:26.183 --> 21:27.426
wants to bite the hand
that feeds him,

21:27.450 --> 21:28.983
I'm gonna take away his dinner

21:29.019 --> 21:30.618
and show him who his master is.

21:30.654 --> 21:32.587
Sean, please.

21:32.622 --> 21:33.955
Gallo might not get out,

21:33.990 --> 21:35.957
and Mike's gonna be
stuck in there with him.

21:35.992 --> 21:38.159
Well, all the more reason
he should put down his gun

21:38.195 --> 21:40.028
and walk out that f---ing door.

21:52.108 --> 21:53.775
Jessica, come in.

21:53.810 --> 21:55.510
I'm sorry to drop by
unannounced,

21:55.545 --> 21:57.045
but I need to talk to you.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.048
No, no, I'm sorry that I had
to leave a little bit early.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.395
I just wanted to get the place
ready for when Mike gets home.

22:02.419 --> 22:05.520
Then I won't take up
much of your time.

22:05.555 --> 22:07.322
They offered Leonard Bailey
a deal.

22:07.357 --> 22:09.123
- How long?
- Seven years.

22:09.159 --> 22:11.159
But I can probably get them
down to five.

22:11.194 --> 22:13.194
Five more years for a crime
he didn't commit

22:13.230 --> 22:14.529
doesn't seem really fair.

22:14.564 --> 22:16.264
And losing a retrial
and dying in prison

22:16.299 --> 22:17.699
doesn't seem fair either.

22:17.734 --> 22:20.068
- But we're not gonna lose.
- That's not true.

22:20.103 --> 22:22.237
There's a good chance we will.

22:22.272 --> 22:23.538
- Jessica--
- Rachel.

22:23.573 --> 22:25.240
Juries are unpredictable.

22:25.275 --> 22:27.475
Even if they'd been told
to disregard something,

22:27.510 --> 22:30.511
they know he was
convicted before.

22:30.547 --> 22:32.714
This is a chance at getting
his life back.

22:32.749 --> 22:34.382
What kind of life
are we talking about?

22:34.417 --> 22:37.118
He's still going to be seen
as a murderer

22:37.153 --> 22:39.387
even by the closest thing
he has to a mother.

22:39.422 --> 22:41.656
I'm not gonna let him die
for a crime he didn't commit.

22:41.691 --> 22:43.057
I don't want to let him
die either.

22:43.093 --> 22:44.859
I want to fight
to get him out.

22:44.895 --> 22:47.195
And I don't think you've been
practicing law long enough

22:47.230 --> 22:49.130
to make that call.

22:49.165 --> 22:51.532
Rachel, this is a win for him.

22:51.568 --> 22:52.734
So get your mind right

22:52.769 --> 22:54.146
so that we can walk
into that prison

22:54.170 --> 22:55.303
on the same page.

23:02.112 --> 23:05.046
Harvey, unless you're here

23:05.081 --> 23:06.521
to tell me you've
come to your senses

23:06.549 --> 23:07.715
about this animal,

23:07.751 --> 23:09.384
this is gonna be
a short conversation.

23:09.419 --> 23:11.552
I came here to show you this.

23:11.588 --> 23:12.687
What is this?

23:12.722 --> 23:14.322
It's a three-year
surveillance agreement

23:14.357 --> 23:16.858
with the best detective
agency in the state.

23:18.662 --> 23:20.895
And what makes you think
just because you follow him,

23:20.931 --> 23:23.131
it's gonna stop him
from committing crimes?

23:23.166 --> 23:25.033
Cameron, I can't have him
in there with Mike.

23:25.068 --> 23:27.001
Well, from what I heard,
Mike's getting out.

23:27.037 --> 23:28.269
It's not that simple.

23:28.305 --> 23:29.837
What do you mean,
it's not that simple?

23:31.141 --> 23:35.009
The SEC pulled some shady shit
with Mike's cellmate,

23:35.045 --> 23:37.779
the same guy that helped get
Mike out in the first place.

23:37.814 --> 23:40.014
Now Mike's been playing
chicken with them,

23:40.050 --> 23:41.416
and if he doesn't drop it,

23:41.451 --> 23:43.217
they're not gonna let him out.

23:43.253 --> 23:44.852
Let me get this straight.

23:44.888 --> 23:46.554
You want me to perjure myself

23:46.589 --> 23:49.023
so you can put this
monster on the street

23:49.059 --> 23:52.293
because your sidekick wants
to fight The Man?

23:52.329 --> 23:53.661
Don't play that shit with me.

23:53.697 --> 23:55.496
You've been crossing
lines for years,

23:55.532 --> 23:57.109
and you didn't lose
a minute's sleep over it.

23:57.133 --> 23:59.045
You're damn right I didn't,
because I was doing it

23:59.069 --> 24:00.835
to put guys like Gallo away,

24:00.870 --> 24:02.737
not let them wander
around at night

24:02.772 --> 24:04.772
hoping some fat guy
with a Polaroid

24:04.808 --> 24:06.452
is gonna keep him from
murdering somebody else.

24:06.476 --> 24:09.677
And what if that person he
was gonna be murdering was me?

24:09.713 --> 24:11.612
Because Mike is to me

24:11.648 --> 24:14.215
what I used to be to you.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.417
Then convince him
to do the right thing

24:16.453 --> 24:18.353
like you tried to do
once with me.

24:18.388 --> 24:21.656
Because, Harvey, you know what
you're doing with Gallo

24:21.691 --> 24:22.924
is wrong.

24:34.315 --> 24:35.348
Hey.

24:35.384 --> 24:36.527
You're not gonna believe this,

24:36.551 --> 24:38.032
but I got Rachel on
the phone for you.

24:38.153 --> 24:39.552
- What?
- Yeah.

24:39.588 --> 24:40.731
She had my number
from the other night,

24:40.755 --> 24:42.455
and she wants to talk to you.

24:42.491 --> 24:44.057
Thanks.

24:44.092 --> 24:46.826
And Mike, if you're staying
in here for me,

24:46.862 --> 24:48.094
don't do it.

24:54.436 --> 24:56.936
Hey. God, I can't
wait to see you.

24:56.972 --> 24:58.605
I can't wait
to see you either.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.406
<i>Are you okay?</i>

25:00.442 --> 25:04.644
Yeah, I, um--I just
wanted to talk to you

25:04.679 --> 25:06.846
about my death row client.

25:06.882 --> 25:08.448
How can I help?

25:08.483 --> 25:09.682
<i>They offered us a deal</i>

25:09.718 --> 25:11.017
<i>for him to get out</i>
<i>in five years,</i>

25:11.052 --> 25:13.219
<i>and Jessica wants to take it.</i>

25:13.255 --> 25:15.855
But I want to fight for him.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.525
Let me guess, she wants
to present a united front.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.226
<i>She does.</i>

25:20.262 --> 25:22.629
Well, I'm not sure
how I can help you

25:22.664 --> 25:24.664
other than to tell you
to follow your gut.

25:24.699 --> 25:28.835
You can help me understand
what it's like to be in prison.

25:35.377 --> 25:36.809
You better be convincing
out there.

25:36.845 --> 25:38.678
Gallo, I'm about
to sell my soul

25:38.713 --> 25:40.980
to make us even,
so sit down, shut up,

25:41.016 --> 25:42.715
and make sure that
after today, I never

25:42.751 --> 25:44.183
see your face again.

25:44.219 --> 25:45.652
Mr. Specter.

25:45.687 --> 25:47.921
Are you ready to be sworn in?

25:47.956 --> 25:49.756
Ladies and gentlemen
of the board,

25:49.791 --> 25:52.025
before Mr. Specter testifies,

25:52.060 --> 25:53.693
I'd like to present Michael Ross

25:53.728 --> 25:55.828
as a witness on behalf
of the state.

25:55.864 --> 25:57.742
Mr. Chairman, this hearing
was called so that I could--

25:57.766 --> 25:59.365
You'll get your chance,
Mr. Specter.

25:59.401 --> 26:01.668
I'd like to hear what
the young man has to say.

26:03.872 --> 26:05.038
I can have him sworn in.

26:05.073 --> 26:06.973
That won't be necessary.

26:07.008 --> 26:09.676
Mr. Ross, you are an inmate
here at Danbury,

26:09.711 --> 26:10.877
is that correct?

26:10.912 --> 26:12.812
Yes, I'm serving
a two-year sentence

26:12.847 --> 26:14.380
for practicing law
without a license.

26:14.416 --> 26:16.649
And what firm did you work at?

26:16.685 --> 26:18.151
I worked for Mr. Specter.

26:18.186 --> 26:20.186
Are you aware that Mr. Specter

26:20.221 --> 26:22.689
originally prosecuted
Frank Gallo?

26:22.724 --> 26:24.023
Yes, I am.

26:24.059 --> 26:25.959
And who made you
aware of it?

26:25.994 --> 26:27.827
Frank Gallo did.

26:27.862 --> 26:30.196
He just mentioned
something in passing?

26:30.231 --> 26:31.698
No.

26:31.733 --> 26:34.200
No, on my first night here,
Mr. Gallo bribed a guard

26:34.235 --> 26:35.513
so that he could
get into my cell,

26:35.537 --> 26:37.081
and then he pretended
to be my roommate.

26:37.105 --> 26:39.439
And after getting
me to trust him,

26:39.474 --> 26:41.385
he told me that he had been
trying to get revenge

26:41.409 --> 26:43.610
on Harvey Specter since the day
he'd been put away.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.712
Then he told me that now
he was gonna get revenge

26:45.747 --> 26:47.513
on Harvey by coming after me.

26:47.549 --> 26:51.084
Was it clear to you what he
meant by "coming after you"?

26:51.119 --> 26:53.052
He said he would kill me.

26:53.088 --> 26:55.188
In fact, he tried to shiv me
the second night,

26:55.223 --> 26:57.890
but a guard stopped him.

26:57.926 --> 26:59.092
Just one more question.

26:59.127 --> 27:02.895
Was Mr. Specter aware
of these threats?

27:02.931 --> 27:05.064
Of course he was.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.467
Why else do you think he's been
trying to get Gallo parole?

27:09.170 --> 27:10.703
Thank you, Mr. Ross.

27:12.941 --> 27:15.208
Mr. Specter, are you prepared
to refute this testimony

27:15.243 --> 27:17.610
under oath?

27:17.646 --> 27:19.112
No, Your Honor.

27:19.147 --> 27:21.547
I'm not.

27:21.583 --> 27:25.184
We'll take
a five-minute recess.

27:25.220 --> 27:26.419
You did this.

27:26.454 --> 27:28.121
You were in on it with him
the whole time.

27:28.156 --> 27:31.257
You're right. I did.

27:31.292 --> 27:33.159
So you come after me,
not him.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.527
I'm coming after both of you,

27:34.562 --> 27:36.195
but I'm coming after him sooner.

27:36.231 --> 27:38.231
Hey, you can't hide from me.

27:38.266 --> 27:39.966
Oh, I don't need
to hide from you,

27:40.001 --> 27:42.101
'cause it turns out
I'm getting out today.

27:42.137 --> 27:44.303
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

27:51.346 --> 27:53.246
Five years is still
a long time.

27:53.281 --> 27:55.248
Yes, it is.

27:55.283 --> 27:57.116
But then you walk out
of here a free man.

27:57.152 --> 27:58.618
A free man, but not
an innocent one.

27:58.653 --> 28:00.286
You're still innocent,
Leonard,

28:00.321 --> 28:01.932
whether the world sees
it that way or not.

28:01.956 --> 28:04.524
But if the world thinks
I'm a convicted murderer,

28:04.559 --> 28:06.192
then I might as well
die in here,

28:06.227 --> 28:09.295
because there's not gonna be
a life out there for me anyway.

28:09.330 --> 28:10.930
No one said it was
going to be easy.

28:10.965 --> 28:13.199
But there's no point
in dying for a crime

28:13.234 --> 28:14.200
you didn't commit.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.601
I don't think
you understand.

28:15.637 --> 28:17.570
I'm not doing this
just to stay alive.

28:17.605 --> 28:21.207
I'm doing this so one day
I can knock on my kid's door,

28:21.242 --> 28:24.377
and they'll know their father
is an innocent man.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.946
If I take this deal,
that's never gonna happen.

28:26.981 --> 28:28.548
If you don't take it,

28:28.583 --> 28:29.982
it may never happen either.

28:32.687 --> 28:36.289
You're pretty quiet.
What do you think?

28:36.324 --> 28:37.390
I--I think
that Jessica

28:37.425 --> 28:39.492
has a lot more experience
than I do.

28:39.527 --> 28:42.895
That's not what I asked you.

28:42.931 --> 28:45.031
I want to know what
you think I should do.

28:45.066 --> 28:46.599
Leonard, the odds
of you getting out--

28:46.634 --> 28:49.402
I said I want to know
what she thinks.

28:56.177 --> 28:59.378
I think you should fight.

28:59.414 --> 29:01.180
Then that's what
I'm going to do.

29:05.954 --> 29:09.055
Goddamn it, I said we need
to be on the same page.

29:09.090 --> 29:10.323
He asked me what I thought.

29:10.358 --> 29:11.624
I'm not gonna lie to him.

29:11.659 --> 29:13.204
I never would've thought
Robert Zane's daughter

29:13.228 --> 29:14.427
would be so naive.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.329
Naive?

29:16.364 --> 29:17.608
I was actually
starting to believe

29:17.632 --> 29:19.265
that you cared about this case,

29:19.300 --> 29:21.134
but the only thing
that you care about

29:21.169 --> 29:23.102
is putting it to bed
as quickly as possible.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.303
How dare you?

29:24.339 --> 29:26.639
Playing the odds isn't
the same as not caring.

29:26.674 --> 29:29.542
Maybe not, but Jessica, I have
watched you my whole career,

29:29.577 --> 29:30.955
and this is the first time
that you've ever

29:30.979 --> 29:32.145
backed away from a fight.

29:32.180 --> 29:33.557
That's because you've never
seen me fight

29:33.581 --> 29:35.915
when someone's life
is on the line.

29:35.950 --> 29:37.350
- You--
- That's right.

29:37.385 --> 29:39.352
I was in a situation like this
once before.

29:39.387 --> 29:42.054
I did what you want me
to do now.

29:42.090 --> 29:44.891
We lost, and it ripped me
to shreds.

29:44.926 --> 29:48.394
So when I tell you I have a lot
more experience than you,

29:48.429 --> 29:50.797
believe it.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.699
Jessica, I'm sorry...

29:53.735 --> 29:58.171
that you lost a case
like this before.

29:58.206 --> 30:00.173
But the way to help Leonard
is not to convince him

30:00.208 --> 30:02.141
to take some deal that
he can't live with.

30:02.177 --> 30:05.478
It is to fight to give him
something worth living for.

30:17.525 --> 30:19.125
What the hell did you do?

30:19.160 --> 30:20.259
I did what I said I'd do.

30:20.295 --> 30:21.794
I kept that animal
behind bars.

30:21.830 --> 30:23.429
I'm talking about Mike.

30:23.464 --> 30:24.864
You cut a deal with him,
didn't you?

30:24.899 --> 30:27.133
No, Harvey, he cut
a deal with me.

30:27.168 --> 30:28.367
What are you talking about?

30:28.403 --> 30:30.436
After you told him I was
involved with this thing,

30:30.471 --> 30:32.149
he called me and asked if I
could do something

30:32.173 --> 30:33.139
about his friend Kevin.

30:33.174 --> 30:34.174
I said I'd look into it,

30:34.209 --> 30:35.975
but he'd have to do
something for me.

30:36.010 --> 30:37.521
And so you made some
bullshit promise with him

30:37.545 --> 30:38.811
in exchange for doing that.

30:38.847 --> 30:40.046
It wasn't bullshit.

30:40.081 --> 30:42.081
I don't work for
the SEC, Harvey.

30:42.116 --> 30:43.916
I put away real criminals.

30:43.952 --> 30:45.496
And the person who put away
Kevin Miller

30:45.520 --> 30:47.753
knows that it's worth it to let
a drunk driver out,

30:47.789 --> 30:49.822
as long as it means
keeping a murderer in.

30:49.858 --> 30:52.258
And to hell with
what happens to Mike.

30:52.293 --> 30:54.760
Hey, he went in there
with his eyes wide open,

30:54.796 --> 30:56.173
and Gallo can't do anything
to him anyway,

30:56.197 --> 30:57.374
because he's getting
out tonight.

30:57.398 --> 30:58.398
Don't you get it?

30:58.433 --> 30:59.643
Mike's not gonna
be safe tonight

30:59.667 --> 31:01.512
or any other night,
because Gallo can get to him

31:01.536 --> 31:03.169
whether he's behind bars or not.

31:03.204 --> 31:05.137
Well, like I said, Harvey,

31:05.173 --> 31:07.006
he knew what he
was getting into,

31:07.041 --> 31:09.575
and he came to me.

31:14.048 --> 31:15.748
Hey, where you been all day?

31:18.186 --> 31:19.752
Been doing what I
said I was gonna do.

31:19.787 --> 31:22.321
I'm getting you out.

31:22.357 --> 31:23.522
You're kidding.

31:23.558 --> 31:26.125
Do I look like I'm kidding?

31:26.160 --> 31:27.605
So take that phone of yours,
call Jill,

31:27.629 --> 31:29.195
and tell her you're
coming home--

31:29.230 --> 31:30.596
tonight.

31:30.632 --> 31:31.597
I don't believe it.

31:31.633 --> 31:32.965
You really did that for me?

31:33.001 --> 31:35.067
I did.

31:35.103 --> 31:38.070
What about you?

31:38.106 --> 31:39.238
I'm getting out with you.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.237
Hm.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.039
What?

31:48.213 --> 31:50.981
I just can't believe I'm gonna
be tucking my kids

31:51.016 --> 31:52.616
into bed tonight.

31:52.651 --> 31:54.818
I can't believe I'm
gonna see Rachel.

31:57.189 --> 31:58.822
I can't thank you
enough, Mike.

32:01.727 --> 32:03.760
All right, let's go.

32:03.796 --> 32:04.961
It's about time.

32:04.997 --> 32:07.197
Not you, Ross.
Just Miller.

32:07.232 --> 32:08.865
What? What are you
talking about?

32:08.901 --> 32:10.467
I'm getting out too.

32:10.502 --> 32:13.370
I'm following orders, and my
orders are to bring him out.

32:13.405 --> 32:15.339
Not you.

32:15.374 --> 32:16.940
You did this.

32:16.975 --> 32:18.842
I didn't do shit.

32:18.877 --> 32:21.011
But I sure as hell am gonna
take advantage of it.

32:24.049 --> 32:25.716
I'm not leaving without Mike.

32:25.751 --> 32:27.718
Yeah, you are.

32:27.753 --> 32:30.087
And I don't care if I
have to drag your ass

32:30.122 --> 32:31.221
out of here myself.

32:31.256 --> 32:34.524
You're leaving right now.

32:34.560 --> 32:35.625
Harvey, good, you're here.

32:35.661 --> 32:36.727
What the hell's going on?

32:36.762 --> 32:38.061
You said you'd
reinstate the deal

32:38.097 --> 32:39.162
if Mike dropped his suit.

32:39.198 --> 32:40.497
- And I did.
- Bullshit.

32:40.532 --> 32:42.344
You pulled his deal, and now
he's in there all alone.

32:42.368 --> 32:43.545
Now if you don't
pick up the phone--

32:43.569 --> 32:45.836
Harvey, I didn't
pull anything.

32:45.871 --> 32:47.904
- What?
- Mike called me.

32:47.940 --> 32:49.150
He told me to hold off
his paperwork

32:49.174 --> 32:50.174
until tomorrow morning.

32:50.209 --> 32:51.775
Why the hell would
he do that, Sean?

32:51.810 --> 32:53.521
Because he has a plan,
and he didn't want you to know.

32:53.545 --> 32:55.612
I don't care what his plan is.
You--

32:55.647 --> 32:57.225
Listen, he doesn't want you
to know, because he didn't

32:57.249 --> 32:58.727
want you to stop it,
and now that you can't,

32:58.751 --> 33:00.617
he's gonna need our help
to bring it home.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.536
Thanks, Jimbo.

33:19.571 --> 33:20.949
Why don't you go ahead
and give me and Mike here

33:20.973 --> 33:22.339
a little privacy?

33:26.945 --> 33:28.044
What do you want, Gallo?

33:28.080 --> 33:29.413
That's a stupid question

33:29.448 --> 33:31.281
after what you pulled
at my parole hearing.

33:31.316 --> 33:33.450
- You didn't deserve to get out.
- Neither did you.

33:33.485 --> 33:35.018
And now you're not gonna.

33:35.053 --> 33:38.088
What, you're gonna
kill me in this cell?

33:38.123 --> 33:40.090
There are guards out there.

33:40.125 --> 33:42.559
It just doesn't sink in
for you, does it?

33:42.594 --> 33:44.828
Those guards out there
work for me.

33:44.863 --> 33:47.364
See, Mike, I wasn't gonna let
what happened last time

33:47.399 --> 33:48.865
happen this time.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.168
No one's gonna come run
helping you at the last second,

33:51.203 --> 33:54.438
because they're all locked up
tight in their bunks.

33:54.473 --> 33:56.039
And irony of ironies,

33:56.074 --> 34:00.110
because of some prisoners'
rights lawsuit way back when,

34:00.145 --> 34:01.545
there are no cameras in cells.

34:01.580 --> 34:02.724
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

34:02.748 --> 34:04.848
No, the time for
waiting is done.

34:06.652 --> 34:08.251
No, no, no, no, no.

34:08.286 --> 34:10.632
I meant, don't you want to hear
about the camera that's in here?

34:10.656 --> 34:13.389
- Bullshit.
- Smile, you son of a bitch.

34:13.425 --> 34:16.393
No!

34:16.428 --> 34:18.428
You did not keep yourself
in here just to do this.

34:18.464 --> 34:19.763
Yeah, Frank, I did.

34:19.797 --> 34:21.708
And now all those guards
that aren't in your pocket--

34:21.733 --> 34:23.533
they're watching this right now.

34:23.569 --> 34:25.902
And it's 60 feet from that
guard station to this cell,

34:25.938 --> 34:27.603
so if I calculated correctly,

34:27.639 --> 34:29.072
they've got Jimbo in cuffs,

34:29.107 --> 34:32.208
and they're gonna be opening
that door right now.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.511
Drop that knife
and step back, Gallo.

34:34.545 --> 34:36.847
Oh, you piece of shit!

34:36.882 --> 34:38.415
Doesn't change anything.

34:38.449 --> 34:39.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see about that.

34:57.870 --> 34:59.903
Louis?

34:59.938 --> 35:03.006
Tara.

35:03.041 --> 35:06.443
I've never seen how beautiful
it is in here at night.

35:06.478 --> 35:08.011
Beautiful.

35:08.046 --> 35:09.679
I want to tell you
what happened.

35:12.417 --> 35:13.683
Please.

35:13.719 --> 35:16.219
The reason Joshua came to town

35:16.255 --> 35:18.221
is that I told him about you--

35:18.257 --> 35:21.024
about us.

35:21.059 --> 35:23.560
So did you break up with him?

35:23.595 --> 35:25.629
Louis, he asked me
to marry him.

35:28.233 --> 35:29.699
And what'd you say?

35:38.710 --> 35:40.677
I told him...

35:40.712 --> 35:42.412
I couldn't marry him

35:42.447 --> 35:44.915
while I felt this way
about another man.

35:46.785 --> 35:49.586
So where does that leave us?

35:49.621 --> 35:53.123
I hope it leaves us
where you want us to be.

35:54.793 --> 35:57.861
It does.

35:57.896 --> 36:00.096
It absolutely does.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.773
You here to bring me
bread and water?

36:09.808 --> 36:12.542
If it was up to me,
I'd let you starve.

36:12.578 --> 36:15.512
Let me guess: you're here
to tell me how much time

36:15.547 --> 36:17.380
they're tacking onto
my sentence.

36:17.416 --> 36:19.883
Well, it doesn't
matter how much.

36:19.918 --> 36:21.818
'Cause I'm gonna get to him,

36:21.853 --> 36:23.920
and I'm gonna get to you.

36:23.956 --> 36:26.089
Sorry, Frank, but you're not
getting anything

36:26.124 --> 36:28.058
tacked onto your sentence.

36:28.093 --> 36:31.528
Your parting gift is going back
to the maximum security hellhole

36:31.563 --> 36:32.929
you came from.

36:35.467 --> 36:36.800
No way.

36:36.835 --> 36:38.580
You don't have the power
to make that happen.

36:38.604 --> 36:40.470
You're right, I don't.

36:40.505 --> 36:44.307
But my friend at the SEC
sure does.

36:44.343 --> 36:45.675
Why are you so upset, Frank?

36:45.711 --> 36:47.377
Does it have anything
to do with the fact

36:47.412 --> 36:48.745
that every inmate in there

36:48.780 --> 36:50.380
knows that you're an informant,

36:50.415 --> 36:52.649
and you'll be lucky to make it
through your first night?

36:54.853 --> 36:56.720
You think I'm afraid?

36:56.755 --> 36:58.922
I think you're shitting
in your pants right now,

36:58.957 --> 37:00.590
which is why I think
you'll be interested

37:00.626 --> 37:03.660
in what's behind
door number two.

37:03.695 --> 37:05.528
You stay here at Danbury,

37:05.564 --> 37:07.297
you do five more years,

37:07.332 --> 37:09.733
and if Mike so much as gets
a pebble in his shoe,

37:09.768 --> 37:13.003
you go back to door number one.

37:13.038 --> 37:16.172
I'll take that hatred
in your face as a yes,

37:16.208 --> 37:17.874
'cause it's the same
look you had

37:17.909 --> 37:19.876
the last time I put you away.

37:37.629 --> 37:39.729
What are you doing here?

37:39.765 --> 37:41.197
Where's Rachel?

37:41.233 --> 37:43.144
I'm just here to tell you
you're about to get a visitor.

37:43.168 --> 37:44.934
You convinced my aunt
to come see me?

37:44.970 --> 37:46.936
No, I couldn't convince her.

37:46.972 --> 37:49.973
But I was able to track down
your daughter.

37:50.008 --> 37:51.374
What?

37:51.410 --> 37:52.676
You heard right.

37:52.711 --> 37:54.110
Maya's right outside.

38:00.252 --> 38:01.518
I'm gonna need a moment.

38:01.553 --> 38:03.253
Of course.

38:06.058 --> 38:08.525
I know you only did this so
she'll tell me to take the deal,

38:08.560 --> 38:10.160
but thank you.

38:11.563 --> 38:15.632
Leonard, she doesn't even
know about the deal.

38:15.667 --> 38:17.400
Then what'd you tell her
to get her to come?

38:17.436 --> 38:19.502
I told her we found new
evidence that her father

38:19.538 --> 38:20.870
is an innocent man.

38:20.906 --> 38:22.372
And she should hear it from you

38:22.407 --> 38:24.407
before we go to court
to prove it.

38:24.443 --> 38:26.509
So you do think I'm
doing the right thing?

38:26.545 --> 38:30.580
Honestly, I don't know if you
are or you're not.

38:30.615 --> 38:33.316
But what I do know is, when you
care about someone,

38:33.351 --> 38:35.385
you have their back either way.

38:52.137 --> 38:53.536
Hi, Daddy.

38:53.572 --> 38:55.472
Hey, sweetheart.

39:27.506 --> 39:29.639
Did it work?

39:29.674 --> 39:32.675
It worked.

39:35.013 --> 39:37.781
We did it.

39:37.816 --> 39:38.915
We did.

39:41.953 --> 39:44.120
Come on, let's get out of here.

39:44.156 --> 39:45.922
Oh, one more thing.

39:45.957 --> 39:47.757
Someone couldn't wait
for you to get home.
