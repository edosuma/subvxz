short and sweet

19:06.312 --> 19:09.731
because her husband's got
a game to watch.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.859
Sadly, one of your better
pep talks.

19:12.859 --> 19:14.736
Pamela.
Oh, hello.

This is my husband Jeff.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.284
You have a lovely home.
Thank you.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.954
Audrey, I saw the layout you did
for next month's issue.

19:23.954 --> 19:24.955
Fantastic.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.998
Hey.
Oh, thank you.

19:26.998 --> 19:28.709
I was really trying to--

19:28.709 --> 19:31.253
Sweet! Rangers just won!

19:33.129 --> 19:34.381
My-- My husband's at the game.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.718
They scored twice
in the last two minutes.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.136
Oh, he said
it was incredible.

19:40.136 --> 19:42.055
Are you a Rangers fan?

19:45.351 --> 19:49.104
I am, so I'm thrilled
to hear your news.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.856
Thank you for sharing that.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.399
Great night, huh?

19:52.399 --> 19:55.444
You know, my company
has excellent seats,

19:55.444 --> 20:00.449
so maybe you and your husband
would like to join us for...

20:02.075 --> 20:04.411
a game sometime.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.748
Definitely take you up on that.
So good to see you again.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.542
And nice to meet you, Jeff.
Excuse me.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.838
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about the
game, but I am so proud of you.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.047
It's all right.

what happened in the game?

Thank God I recorded it.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.483
It's unbelievable.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.611
Now I get why you guys like
to watch things over and over,

20:37.611 --> 20:39.696
even though you already know
the outcome.
