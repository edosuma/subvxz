00:34.520 --> 00:36.568
RECEPTIONIST: <i>Good morning.
Dynamic Progressive Systems.</i>

00:36.680 --> 00:37.727
<i>Please hold.</i>

00:37.880 --> 00:40.121
It's not a small thing.
5% is a lot.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.442
If you've managed a household
with kids and stuff... 5% is a lot.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.130
You know what, Dan?
Just walk with me.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.964
No. I don't care
if everyone hears us.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.724
You really wanna do this here?
You do?

00:47.880 --> 00:48.961
I don't wanna be doing
it at all, Chuck.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.964
It's just that we had terms, and now
you're changing those terms again.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.009
We are restructuring
the department salaries.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.810
That's just the bottom line.
That's the way it is.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.803
I know it's not
what you want to hear.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.566
Dan, just walk with me.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.688
A little annoying. What?

01:03.840 --> 01:05.046
It's just a little annoying.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.009
"Walk with me." You
say that a lot.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.810
It's stuff like that you
say, you know.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.240
That's why Brian Peters
wrote "You're an asshole"

01:10.320 --> 01:11.481
on your parking curb thing.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.481
What the fuck, Dan?

01:14.320 --> 01:15.321
I'm sorry.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.164
Do you really wanna challenge
me in public, Dan?

01:17.320 --> 01:19.084
This was my best year.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.129
I am an asshole, Dan,
because I have to make

01:21.200 --> 01:23.043
decisions to keep
the company strong.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.967
You make a living
from this company.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.326
You're replaceable, frankly.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.081
If you were to leave,
Dynamic would continue.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.010
So, don't minimize
my company's interests.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.845
Now, if you would please,
as I said before, walk with me.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.286
We can discuss
this in my office.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.090
Chuck, just because you
caught me...

01:38.280 --> 01:40.521
which is, granted,
a pretty big feat...

01:40.680 --> 01:42.284
in a trust fall
at the company retreat...

01:42.360 --> 01:43.520
which you make us all go to...

01:43.560 --> 01:46.080
and that I don't like, by the way,
that nobody here really likes.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.280
Nobody does. Right, Russell?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.361
I like them. Russell
is a team player.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.204
DAN: Russell
is a beaten-down dog.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.407
You're Mr. Negative.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.286
Are you making less?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.528
I'm a sales manager, Dan.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.449
You want a bigger slice of the pie,
start your own company.

02:00.640 --> 02:01.641
Oh, I've been thinking about it.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.920
Everybody thinks about it...

02:02.960 --> 02:04.371
but don't bitch when the people
who actually do it...

02:04.560 --> 02:05.607
pay themselves
what they deserve.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.127
I have been in airports for two days,
preparing a deal for you.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.487
I came in here just
to get a bagel,

02:11.560 --> 02:13.722
because I haven't had
a meal since Tuesday.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.770
And then, you tell me I'm gonna
have to take 5% less this year?

02:16.920 --> 02:18.410
I don't want new terms, Chuck.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.244
I want to be able to see
my kids sometimes.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.640
The old "kid" card.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.801
(LAUGHS)
Strong.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.243
I'm gonna do it.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.565
Really?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.087
You're gonna go
up against me and Dynamic?

02:31.640 --> 02:34.086
Yeah. I will see you in the field.
You should look for me.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.569
Because I'll be the guy
in first who's happy.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.840
I think you're better off for me
than against me, Dan.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.926
Well, I actually have my own ideas
on how to do this job.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.402
It doesn't involve
any of that "trust fall" shit.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.807
Okay. Game on.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.844
Game on.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.480
By the way, anyone
here wanna join me?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.284
There's a lot
of great people here.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.481
How about it?
Come on.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.449
Any of you guys wanna build
a total starship with me?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.284
"Starship"?

02:59.840 --> 03:01.000
Yeah, I'm just riffing, here.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.765
I wasn't planning on founding
my own company here today...

03:03.920 --> 03:05.331
but if anyone wants
to play a key role...

03:05.480 --> 03:08.609
in a new mineral sales company
that does it the right way...

03:08.760 --> 03:09.841
then walk through that door
with me,

03:09.960 --> 03:11.291
because there
is a place for you.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.205
Guys!

03:34.520 --> 03:35.681
Men!

03:36.040 --> 03:37.166
We're doing this.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.287
Doing what?

03:39.040 --> 03:41.360
Boarding the starship. Starting
this new adventure together.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.881
Uh, I'm just walking to my car.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.361
Because I just got let go...

03:46.520 --> 03:47.965
because of some mandatory
age limit.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.687
Oh.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.051
Do you still wanna work?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.362
Well, I'm just 67. Yeah!

03:54.520 --> 03:55.806
I'm not the Crypt Keeper.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.321
All right, great!
Come work with me.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.164
We'll drop these guys. Yeah!

04:00.840 --> 04:01.887
Let's drop these pussies!

04:02.280 --> 04:03.441
Right!

04:03.600 --> 04:04.647
Look at us. We're standing here.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.846
We're synergizing already.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.002
I'm excited. Thank you.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.165
How about you, young buck, huh?

04:10.320 --> 04:12.322
Are you starshipping with us?
Yeah.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.045
What did you do at Dynamic?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.487
Uh... Um... No.
I don't work there.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.801
You just walked out of there.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.689
Well, I interviewed.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.410
But you got a box
with office belongings.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.485
Yeah. I brought it to the interview
to show confidence.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.525
Do you have any sales
experience?

04:31.680 --> 04:33.205
Yes, I do.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.930
Great. Foot Locker.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.651
And reasons for leaving?

04:36.800 --> 04:38.165
I don't like feet.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.685
But I do like people.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.201
I'm good with people.
It's for real, it's true.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.609
Do you work hard? Yeah.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.721
Like, what's "hard"?

04:45.960 --> 04:47.371
(STAMMERING)
The hardest.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.204
Don't just say it because you
think I want to hear it.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.727
No, it's true.
Whatever you need.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.886
All right.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.164
If you're willing to try,
I'll turn you into an animal.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.561
Hop in. Come on, young
buck, we're doing it.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.688
I'm willing!
Let's go.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.001
All right.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.561
Let's hit Dunkin' Donuts,
and we'll launch this thing.

05:24.920 --> 05:25.921
Good.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.964
<i>I know we've had
a little dry spell...</i>

05:28.120 --> 05:30.964
but I'm proud to announce
that we got this deal.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.640
Bill said, "Fly up,
let's shake hands."

05:32.760 --> 05:34.000
Fuck, yes!

05:34.080 --> 05:35.081
(LAUGHING)

05:37.600 --> 05:38.647
Oh, excuse me.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.485
I'm sorry about the "fuck."

05:41.640 --> 05:42.926
I get to go on a trip?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.047
Yeah.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.964
Overnight?

05:46.120 --> 05:47.281
Is this your first
business trip, Mike?

05:47.440 --> 05:48.441
Yeah.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.921
You didn't have any Foot
Locker business trips?

05:51.120 --> 05:52.770
No. They would all just
come to me.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.810
Yeah. All right, we're
going on a trip.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.163
Will things happen?

05:59.920 --> 06:03.163
Like, explers?

06:04.760 --> 06:06.444
"Explers"? Yeah.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.443
Can you use it in a sentence?

06:08.600 --> 06:12.969
"We're gonna go on a business
trip and have explers."

06:13.280 --> 06:14.327
"Exploits"?

06:14.480 --> 06:15.925
Exploits.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.650
No, there won't be any exploits.
Just up and back.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.484
I got too much stuff at home.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.483
You can have them,
after we close the deal.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.124
Is it just us going up there,
or are they bringing up a fluffer?

06:25.320 --> 06:28.130
Just us, free and clear.
What's a "fluffer"?

06:28.640 --> 06:30.768
When a company wants
to do a sweetheart deal

06:30.840 --> 06:32.604
with a friend or something...

06:32.760 --> 06:35.525
they generally
pretend to negotiate

06:35.600 --> 06:37.120
with another company,
right to the end.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.486
Just to make it look legit.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.971
Well, this one's all ours.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.201
Come on.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.125
Tomorrow, we are going
on a business trip.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.320
Let's go close this thing.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.521
Go get them, Dan.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.206
I feel good about this one.
You got a strong number set.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.646
I appreciate that, Don.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.450
You've been here
since the beginning.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.720
After we close this, we're
gonna get an actual office.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.009
Hey, Paul we need to talk.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.526
I'm headed off to Portland.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.247
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.164
I didn't mean to surprise you.
Everything all right?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.408
I'm doing stuff. That's cool.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.369
Lookit, "doing
stuff" is natural.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.409
Dad... I used to "do stuff."

07:13.560 --> 07:16.484
I used to "do stuff" three times a day.
And I still "do stuff."

07:16.640 --> 07:18.722
(SOFTLY)
Dad. I don't "do stuff" as much as I used to...

07:18.800 --> 07:19.801
(LAUGHS)

07:20.000 --> 07:23.083
because now I'm tired
from doing other stuff.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.651
But there's no crime, here.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.002
There's not gonna be a trial.
Nothing happened.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.920
I don't even know
what we were talking about.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.001
When I was your age...

07:30.160 --> 07:32.208
we used to get these
magazines for my sisters...

07:32.360 --> 07:33.885
that would be like a lingerie
or swimsuit...

07:33.960 --> 07:35.007
No, that's not...

07:35.080 --> 07:37.686
But now you go online, you
see a clown fuck an alpaca.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.887
I don't watch that, Dad.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.247
It's not a big deal.
It's just an easy thing.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.327
I want you to get
back to doing it,

07:42.440 --> 07:43.487
but you should do it
in the bathroom...

07:43.560 --> 07:44.840
because you can't
lock this door.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.450
And your sister could
walk in and it's no good.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.090
So, just do it
somewhere else, okay?

07:48.280 --> 07:50.044
Yeah. Just keep a lid on it.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.562
Like a gentleman does. A
gentleman celebrates his body.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.927
You know that Walt Whitman
poem, "Song of Myself"?

07:56.120 --> 07:57.640
We don't need to talk
about it anymore.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.887
It's a song. Walt Whitman,
he celebrates his body.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.730
You're celebrating your body.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.450
So, I don't think
it's a big deal.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.241
Okay.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.402
I'm gonna be back tomorrow. I'm
just going up for the handshake.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.925
And when I come home...

08:09.080 --> 08:10.923
you are gonna come out of this
room for a little bit...

08:11.080 --> 08:13.560
and me and you, just me
and you, we're gonna hang out.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.205
Okay, you're hugging me.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.361
I don't know what's going
on with your hands.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.726
Get back to the computer.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.644
Bye, Dad. Bye.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.601
(SIGHS)

08:46.480 --> 08:48.642
Can we deal with the whole
private school thing today?

08:48.840 --> 08:51.161
Do you mean,
like the pros and cons?

08:51.320 --> 08:53.288
No, we did the pros and cons.
It was all pros.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.283
I meant paying for it.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.680
You know I'm leaving, right?
Portland, for the handshake.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.290
I have 20 minutes to pack.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.807
Yeah. Remember we were gonna
talk to Paul today, though...

09:01.960 --> 09:04.088
about why he's been so
withdrawn.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.366
Can we FaceTime that?

09:05.480 --> 09:06.641
Can it be today?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.290
Yeah. This is the big one.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.925
When are you back?
Tomorrow, before dinner.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.809
We just gotta go there and shake hands.
It's all done.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.121
What do you got going today?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.481
I was probably going
to go to work,

09:14.560 --> 09:16.130
and then maybe raise
our children.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.810
Sounds good. Wait, eat!

09:17.960 --> 09:20.008
I have to put these reports
in my power spread.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.931
Men over 40 can suffer from fainting
spells if they skip meals...

09:23.120 --> 09:25.168
and have high stress levels,
and poor muscle tone.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.121
I have to pack.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.328
Hey, Dad. Hey.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.130
Are you going on a trip?

09:31.280 --> 09:32.486
I am, yeah.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.801
You wanna help me out, here?

09:33.960 --> 09:35.644
I'll show you what I always
bring with me.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.650
Space for my running gear here.
Book goes here.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.167
That's all you do
on your business trips?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.890
Read and run? Yep.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.007
And do business.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.400
Grab some running gear
out of the closet and help me pack.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.005
Okay. Love you.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.808
Can I ask you a question
before you go?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.121
Honey, my plane's gonna...

09:55.520 --> 09:56.646
Is it a little question?

09:57.240 --> 09:58.366
Kind of.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.689
Okay, yeah. What
is your little question?

10:00.840 --> 10:04.208
When I go to school, I don't
like to go to school at all.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.650
It makes my stomach hurt.
The jokes hurt my feelings.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.041
I cry in the bathroom,
and pretend to poop for...

10:10.200 --> 10:11.850
I don't know, two hours.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.490
That's not even...

10:13.640 --> 10:14.880
Is that a question?

10:16.520 --> 10:20.844
Okay. I know that school
can be hard, honey.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.002
But you gotta go,
or you'll be a moron.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.009
Did you do my daddy
homework thing?

10:26.160 --> 10:27.764
Yes, I have not.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.285
But I'm tweaking it in my mind,

10:29.360 --> 10:31.124
and I will figure
it out on my trip.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.001
DAN: <i>Okay, I have two seconds, here.
"Your daddy."</i>

10:37.160 --> 10:38.400
<i>Why is this so hard?</i>

10:38.560 --> 10:40.085
<i>"Your daddy is..."</i>

10:40.280 --> 10:42.282
<i>I pretty much just work
these days, sorry.</i>

10:42.400 --> 10:43.401
<i>Selling swarf.</i>

10:44.000 --> 10:46.685
<i>That's metal residue left
over after the construction of large objects...</i>

10:46.840 --> 10:48.205
<i>like the Golden Gate...</i>

10:48.960 --> 10:50.724
<i>Never mind, it's fucking boring.</i>

10:50.920 --> 10:53.685
<i>Anyway, Daddy's been working to get
the starship off the ground.</i>

10:54.400 --> 10:56.880
<i>That's from a team-building thing.
Our version.</i>

10:57.040 --> 10:58.246
<i>We went to the batting cages.</i>

10:58.320 --> 10:59.401
<i>I thought it was a good place...</i>

10:59.560 --> 11:02.080
<i>to teach the guys about being
aggressive and taking what's yours.</i>

11:02.400 --> 11:04.528
<i>Crowding the plate,
in a business sense.</i>

11:05.560 --> 11:07.722
<i>But we nailed a big deal,
and we're travelling today...</i>

11:07.880 --> 11:09.600
<i>in the time-honored
ritual of the handshake.</i>

11:10.240 --> 11:12.641
<i>Which is good,
because it's been a down year, swarf-wise.</i>

11:12.800 --> 11:13.881
<i>I really need this deal.</i>

11:14.040 --> 11:15.963
<i>I'm stalling like a freak
on this private school thing...</i>

11:16.120 --> 11:18.646
<i>because I can't afford it
without this handshake.</i>

11:18.800 --> 11:20.450
<i>And I don't want
your mom to know.</i>

11:20.600 --> 11:23.410
<i>But she's gonna catch me soon
because she's smarter than I am.</i>

11:24.240 --> 11:26.607
<i>Probably, that's not
what you're looking for.</i>

11:26.760 --> 11:29.240
Why do males go
on a business trip?

11:29.400 --> 11:32.483
To bring home the kill,
and dig the night.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.802
Going to Portland,
Timothy, not Vegas.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.604
And aren't you 72?

11:37.080 --> 11:38.605
I'm 67.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.121
What do you mean,
"bring home the kill"?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.282
Traditionally, even way back...

11:43.440 --> 11:46.967
guys would leave their caves
with a pointy stick or something.

11:47.120 --> 11:50.283
Go out, get it done,
bring it home.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.846
And the, "dig the night" part?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.651
Well, then they'd stay on a little longer
than they needed to...

11:56.800 --> 11:59.167
and fuck around a little bit.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.281
Traditionally.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.602
Holy shit. "Trunkman, Daniel."

12:02.760 --> 12:04.683
I'm next on the upgrade
list, boys.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.650
I've flown 31 times this last
year making this goddamn deal.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.121
Never once have they ever
said, "Daniel Trunkman."

12:10.280 --> 12:13.011
Say "Daniel Trunkman." Come on.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.525
Say it.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.161
Danielle Trunkman.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.051
- Yes!
- WOMAN: Hi.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.009
DAN: It's "Daniel,"
not "Danielle."

12:21.080 --> 12:22.081
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
- DAN: Thank you very much.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.248
I'm gonna go obviously
to the front.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.440
You guys go around the back.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.720
Please. Thank you, sir.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.325
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: <i>Ladies
and gentlemen, welcome on board.</i>

12:28.400 --> 12:30.528
<i>US Midland Airlines
Flight 3257...</i>

12:30.680 --> 12:32.330
<i>with service to Portland, Maine.</i>

12:32.520 --> 12:33.806
<i>In preparation for takeoff...</i>

12:33.960 --> 12:36.241
<i>all carry-on items should be
placed in the overhead bins...</i>

12:36.320 --> 12:37.731
<i>or under the seat
in front of you.</i>

12:37.880 --> 12:39.211
I've never been upgraded.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.164
That's all right.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.121
In 12 years.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.526
That's cool.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.365
Ordinarily, I'd like to give you
my seat, like this guy did.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.080
But I, uh...

12:49.240 --> 12:52.210
I can't honor you on this
flight, because I have to...

12:52.360 --> 12:55.045
finish some important
presentation prep...

12:55.200 --> 12:58.682
on some cap-down brokerage recaps
that just need some tweaking.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.686
But I appreciate you.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.403
Thank you. It is an honor
to sit in front of you.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.925
So much.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.245
Okay, please.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.885
I'd like you to have the seat.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.368
Mike, can I say
something to you?

13:31.520 --> 13:35.241
Can you not say your whole
name today, sorry, um...

13:35.400 --> 13:37.562
when we meet
the Benjaminson Group?

13:37.720 --> 13:38.960
Why?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.291
Because, um...

13:41.440 --> 13:42.930
I'm just going to be
honest with you.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.366
I think that when you
say your whole name,

13:44.440 --> 13:46.761
it causes people
to lose focus on...

13:46.920 --> 13:48.410
pertinent business stuff.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.927
Why would my name
cause people to

13:51.000 --> 13:53.446
lose focus on pertinent
business stuff?

13:55.080 --> 13:56.650
Say it.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.040
Mike Pancake.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.610
(LAUGHING)

14:03.400 --> 14:04.561
TIMOTHY: I just forget.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.803
So, uh, yeah. That's all.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.567
You can say, "Mike." Just
don't say the breakfast part.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.520
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:16.960 --> 14:18.291
FaceTime time.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.405
<i>Hey, Dad.</i> Hey, buddy.
Hey, Trunkmans.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.608
<i>Where have you been, Dan?
I've been trying you for two hours.</i>

14:25.800 --> 14:27.802
Well, I was just in the sky,
I just turned my...

14:27.960 --> 14:30.645
Paul was arrested.
There's a police report.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.404
They said he was shoplifting.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.250
<i>What?</i>
I sent you an email.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.528
<i>Okay. I have it open right here.</i>

14:36.680 --> 14:38.170
"Suspect Paul William Trunkman

14:38.240 --> 14:39.969
"was detained
by store security..."

14:40.120 --> 14:44.330
"who found on his person
a five-shade palette of..."

14:44.480 --> 14:46.608
"Show-Stopping Eye Shadows."

14:46.960 --> 14:48.121
Eye shadows?

14:48.800 --> 14:53.010
"The shades in question are Blue Belgian
Frost, Straight-Up Teal, Celeste."

14:53.200 --> 14:55.680
I don't understand. Are
you doing monster makeup?

14:55.840 --> 14:57.046
Movies with the guys?

14:57.200 --> 15:00.329
<i>You mean my friends that I don't
have because I'm a huge goon?</i>

15:00.560 --> 15:01.686
<i>Those guys?</i>

15:03.160 --> 15:05.322
<i>I wanted to put it on my eyes...</i>

15:05.480 --> 15:07.323
<i>to hang out with the kids
that don't fit in.</i>

15:08.000 --> 15:09.331
<i>The goth kids.</i>

15:09.480 --> 15:10.527
They laughed at me...

15:10.720 --> 15:12.722
because they use dark
colors around their eyes...

15:12.880 --> 15:15.008
and I didn't know you were
supposed to do that...

15:15.160 --> 15:16.366
and I used teal.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.524
<i>I can't even fit
in with the kids...</i>

15:20.320 --> 15:21.367
<i>that don't fit in.</i>

15:23.840 --> 15:25.365
Tough FaceTime.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.443
Dan, we need to talk about pulling
the trigger on private school.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.248
I think he's really
isolated where he is.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.051
And the tuition at Primmler
Day Academy...

15:39.200 --> 15:40.361
is $19,000.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.646
19 thou...

15:44.880 --> 15:45.881
Dan?

15:47.240 --> 15:48.287
Do my homework!

15:48.440 --> 15:52.081
Sweetie, we lost the connection.
Dad's face froze.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.131
We're going to try
him later, okay?

15:54.280 --> 15:56.282
- Okay.
- MIKE: Dan?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.283
DAN: <i>Who's your daddy?</i>

16:03.880 --> 16:05.882
<i>Your daddy is a man who is worried
about your brother...</i>

16:06.040 --> 16:07.963
<i>because he stands
out, physically.</i>

16:08.120 --> 16:09.610
Hello, welcome to Portland.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.120
DAN: <i>That's not
easy at that age...</i>

16:11.880 --> 16:13.405
<i>so Dad's worried about him.</i>

16:13.560 --> 16:16.564
<i>But Dad has to focus on this
important meeting right now.</i>

16:16.720 --> 16:19.246
<i>So, he wants to go on a run
to clear his mind.</i>

16:19.720 --> 16:22.451
<i>But you packed
Mommy's running stuff.</i>

16:22.600 --> 16:24.011
<i>Sports bra.</i>

16:24.160 --> 16:26.242
<i>Scoop Me Up Tank.</i>

16:26.400 --> 16:27.520
<i>Maybe, instead of running...</i>

16:27.640 --> 16:30.166
<i>I'll have a junior wine
from the junior suite fridge.</i>

16:30.320 --> 16:32.243
<i>Smell the roses, you know?</i>

16:32.400 --> 16:33.401
<i>Deal's done.</i>

16:33.560 --> 16:35.767
<i>Just going to smell
one rose, here.</i>

16:36.760 --> 16:38.171
<i>A moment for Dan.</i>

16:45.320 --> 16:46.321
Hey, Dan.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.924
Hey, Chuck.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.601
Ooh.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.205
I've got to go talk
to Benjaminson.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.930
But I will catch you later.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.531
Cheers.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.770
Yeah.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.209
DAN: <i>Bill, hey. Dan Trunkman.</i>

17:20.359 --> 17:21.964
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little thrown.

17:22.119 --> 17:25.646
I saw Chuck Portnoy from Dynamic
Progressive Systems...

17:25.800 --> 17:26.767
and she mentioned...
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:26.839 --> 17:29.241
that she's gonna see
you, Bill, also.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.490
Um, it was my understanding
that we were done, really...

17:33.640 --> 17:35.927
that we were just going to do
a walkthrough for you and shake hands.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.606
Maid service. Come in.

17:38.760 --> 17:43.766
Anyway, Bill, can you give me
a holler back about this? Thanks.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.771
Good afternoon.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.088
Good afternoon to you.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.890
I'll be out of here
in 15 minutes.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.530
Oh, you live a busy lifestyle?

17:55.080 --> 17:57.048
I'm sorry. Well, listen.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.726
Sit back, relax, grab a drink...

17:59.880 --> 18:02.201
and enjoy me cleaning.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.048
And touch yourself
with your hands.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.691
Can you say some things,
while you're tidying, to me?

18:19.240 --> 18:20.890
I've never done this before.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.567
(CLEARS THROAT)
You know, I'm not seeing enough titty from you.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.169
Make sure that, periodically,
you turn to face me...

18:29.320 --> 18:32.051
so I can see some more
titty from you.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.329
I don't understand.
Are you saying...

18:35.480 --> 18:37.482
to privately touch...

18:37.640 --> 18:38.721
my penis?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.564
Certainly.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.883
I'd like to try being
someone else for a while.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.761
So, maybe you could
call me "Tony Stark"...

18:48.920 --> 18:51.491
and talk about my iron cock?

18:52.800 --> 18:54.723
Tim. Timothy? Yeah?

18:54.880 --> 18:58.248
This woman right here
is an actual maid.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.040
The sex maid you
hired is in with me.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.609
You're doing a great job.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.091
Okay? Okay.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.480
Okay. Okay.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.721
Okay.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.044
Now, let's stop
drinking champagne.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.282
Let's stop buying women.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.965
And let's focus.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.485
This deal may not be done...

19:20.680 --> 19:22.921
and, man, it is imperative
that we shake hands...

19:23.080 --> 19:24.320
MIKE: Wait.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.601
(STUTTERING)
Sorry.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.444
I don't know what that means.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.081
What what means?

19:29.240 --> 19:32.210
Impera... The "E" word.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.131
I didn't say an "E" word.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.443
'Em... Empera...

19:37.600 --> 19:39.364
Emperlat... Emperlaten?

19:39.520 --> 19:40.931
"Emperlaten"?

19:41.080 --> 19:43.731
Just stay here and don't
do any more weird shit.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.406
I'm gonna go for a run.
I need to clear my head.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.050
Chuck's here.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.565
I really need to run
and focus right now.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.449

20:39.640 --> 20:41.085
Bill. How are you?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.163
Dan Trunkman from Apex Select...

20:43.320 --> 20:45.129
Chuck Portnoy
from Dynamic Systems...

20:45.280 --> 20:46.805
who I think you know, don't you?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.325
I do. Yeah. We are competitors.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.845
We are? Direct.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.162
I guess. I hadn't really
noticed, but, okay.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.163
Hmm. And this is Jim Spinch.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.606
Jim. Hey, Dan.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.000
How are you?
Good, you?

20:57.160 --> 20:58.650
Sorry. Sure.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.006
Jim's my boss.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.684
Who makes your gear?
What kind of...?

21:03.840 --> 21:05.922
What's the get-up?

21:06.080 --> 21:07.605
Uh, Danish top. Okay.

21:07.760 --> 21:12.368
And the sweats are a riff on,
I think, South American field slacks.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.011
Um...

21:14.120 --> 21:17.442
"Machos," they're called.
Or "Machetes."

21:17.600 --> 21:20.444
My wife has "Machos." Or
"Machetes," I don't know.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.886
I just call them
"Nancy's pants."

21:22.600 --> 21:23.681
Chuck just showed us...

21:23.880 --> 21:25.848
your redbook rates only make
sense if we're doing buybacks.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.731
I'm not doing buyback deals
until it's out the door and we refactor market.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.689
I just wanna be clear
that those are the terms now.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.046
So, Jim, you're opening
the deal back up?

21:32.200 --> 21:33.884
Well, it wasn't
closed quite, Dan.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.691
So, I just wanted to hear you
both under these new terms today.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.040
Just you and Chuck, that's all.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.161
Those pants are so tight,

21:39.240 --> 21:40.571
you'd think I could see
your balls or your dick.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.721
But I don't.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.565
Maybe I shouldn't have
said that, but it's weird.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.961
So, are we going back
to our original brokerage sets?

21:47.120 --> 21:48.201
In fact, is that a crease?

21:48.360 --> 21:49.805
No. I don't have
a crease, thank you.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.246
A slit? No.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.243
- CHUCK: There's space.
- DAN: There is no space.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.561
There's actually space.
It's alarming.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.920
DAN: There's clearly no space.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.088
I'm trying to determine the...

21:58.240 --> 22:01.881
Jim. Are we going to start
at our first rate presentation?

22:02.040 --> 22:04.566
I'm giving you both a clean start.
That's it, yeah.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.082
And you guys know each other?
You and Chuck?

22:10.560 --> 22:13.006
Yeah, we've done
a couple of deals.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.844
And you came together today?

22:14.920 --> 22:15.921
Almost.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.650
I came, then Jim
came on my face.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.051
But thanks for asking, Dan.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.081
Wow.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.931
How wonderfully brassy. Are
you guys coming inside?

22:24.080 --> 22:27.880
I already came inside of Jim,
but thank you for asking.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.451
Jeez, guy.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.760
We're going to eat in here.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.281
Wow.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.529
Chuck, what are you doing?

22:37.680 --> 22:41.127
Here?
Now? Chuck?

22:41.280 --> 22:42.691
Well, did you guys
shake hands already...

22:42.880 --> 22:44.803
or was I misled
about the deal being done?

22:44.960 --> 22:47.930
I am here to shake hands.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.001
Oh.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.646
So am I.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.327
(WHISTLING)

23:04.960 --> 23:06.803
I hope it's clear that while there
are higher upfront costs...

23:06.960 --> 23:08.644
than possibly you
are used to or prefer...

23:08.800 --> 23:12.600
these are one-offs
and, over time...

23:14.560 --> 23:15.766
DAN: Fuck!

23:15.920 --> 23:16.921
Whoa. You all right?

23:17.160 --> 23:19.606
No. I'm good, I'm good.
I just...

23:19.760 --> 23:22.570
I just had a stressful
afternoon...

23:22.720 --> 23:24.449
and no granola.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.090
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.960
What was the last thing I said?

23:31.040 --> 23:32.041
Uh, "Fuck."

23:32.680 --> 23:33.681
DAN: No. Right before.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.960
Oh, you were talking about having
extremely high upfront costs built in.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.964
I said "extremely"?
You said "extremely."

23:39.120 --> 23:40.326
I'm going to have to call
you out on that, Jim.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.842
I didn't say "extremely"
because I wouldn't characterize our...

23:44.000 --> 23:47.527
My legs feel a little bit
like, uh, Slinkys.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.641
Fuck.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.767
I said that again.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.365
I'm going to sit down. Sit down.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.204
Yeah. Okay.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.282
Mike, finish.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.201
Sorry.

24:05.440 --> 24:10.048
Um, I'm Mineral Deposits Sales
Director at Apex Select, Mike Pancake.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.161
What was your last name?

24:14.440 --> 24:15.487
Pancake.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.801
Like, breakfast?

24:17.720 --> 24:18.721
It's Greek, so...

24:19.800 --> 24:20.961
It's delicious.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.360
Yum.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.481

Are you Steve Toast?

24:26.280 --> 24:27.520
(LAUGHING)

24:30.120 --> 24:33.488
I know this deal is getting close
to the finish line for you...

24:33.640 --> 24:35.324
but when the mineral market
bottomed out in Greece,

24:35.400 --> 24:36.440
it took us all by surprise.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.244
We gotta go back and look
at our whole fourth quarter.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.402
And Chuck and Dynamic, they brought
up some interesting points...

24:40.480 --> 24:42.200
about how they could
help us fourth quarter.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.803
We weren't, you and us, quite
at the handshake stage.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.049
Well, we'll just have
to disagree on that.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.846
Maybe we didn't totally shake.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.241
We definitely grasped
one another's hands.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.289
Now, maybe we didn't
do that small

24:56.360 --> 24:58.249
pump-up-and-down thing
to finish it off.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.447
No, we didn't.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.927
I'm here. Let's pump, Jim.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.001
All right. Hold on, Dan.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.000

It's been a year, Jim.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.240
All right, Dan, look.
Here's what we're going to do.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.522
DAN: Chuck's presenting
to Dirk Austerlitz in Berlin.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.446
So are we.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.840
Jim said it wasn't necessary,

25:15.920 --> 25:17.046
but I insisted.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.730
So, gear up.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.609
We have to go right
there tomorrow.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.444
I thought we were done.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.080
Yeah.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.088
I've never made love to a woman.

25:31.680 --> 25:35.366
I made love to my wife,
but I don't love her.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.765
She's cruel.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.564
Didn't you just
order a sex maid?

25:41.720 --> 25:45.042
Oh, yes, but I don't cheat.
I just observe.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.243
But, no, my wife's the only one.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.442
So, I want to get a divorce.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.321
But I wanna leave her with some money.
A sufficient...

25:55.800 --> 25:56.801
Uh...

25:57.880 --> 26:00.201
And I was hoping
that my commission on this deal

26:00.280 --> 26:02.328
would allow me to do that.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.643
So I could make love just once.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.606
Wheelbarrow position.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.847
It
is the one that I would like to explore.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.322
That position wouldn't...
My wife...

26:20.000 --> 26:21.843
She looks
like a vending machine.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.001
Over there.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.844
She looks just like that.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.806
Your wife's square?

26:29.960 --> 26:31.610
Rectangular, yes.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.286
But vending machines are square.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.681
That's square?

26:40.200 --> 26:41.964
Kind of square.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.205
That shape there?

26:47.760 --> 26:48.966
Mike, did you go to college?

26:50.520 --> 26:52.602
I did not.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.207

went to Ithaca College.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.726
No.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.962
(STAMMERING)
I didn't.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.884
I went to a special school.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.523
And I live in one of those homes

27:12.040 --> 27:13.280
your clothes and stuff.

I'm kind
of like a counselor there.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.724
I'm gonna go get a Pepsi, okay?

Like the German bridges

28:25.400 --> 28:26.970

The English would have the German

you to turn right

30:16.720 --> 30:19.440
We're kind of in a hurry, but I think
I have a friend who's <i>shvitzing.</i>

30:19.800 --> 30:21.564
Go on in, if necessary.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.006
Our friend is a woman.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.082
I was hoping maybe you
could go grab her.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.010
It's a unisex <i>shvitz.</i>

30:27.480 --> 30:28.527
Go on in.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.843
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

30:38.720 --> 30:39.767

30:39.920 --> 30:41.120
Big boobies, coming right here.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.366
Mike...

30:42.520 --> 30:43.760
It's a pleasure to meet you.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.120
Let me just go find
Helen, take my shot...

30:46.280 --> 30:47.930
and I'll meet you in the lobby
in a few minutes, okay?

30:48.040 --> 30:49.087
Uh, wait.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.603
Maybe we should stay.

30:51.880 --> 30:54.201
To, uh, support you.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.569
And maybe see some vaginas.

30:56.760 --> 30:57.841
This is crunch time, Mike.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.200
We can't go rolling up on her,
three dudes in a suit...

31:00.240 --> 31:01.241
in a steambath.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.329
It's intimidating.
She'll be overwhelmed.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.522
Just for the record,
I'd like to go with you

31:05.600 --> 31:06.965
and support you.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.443
And also see nude women.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.884
But I understand.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.690
But I want to.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.250
Oh, okay. Just go ahead.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.365
Thank you. Okay.

two butt cracks!

Yes?

Dan Trunkman, Apex Select.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.601
You're in my <i>shvitz.</i>

31:48.680 --> 31:49.886
I apologize for that.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.769
I have some numbers

31:51.840 --> 31:53.330
that I think would make
sense for both of us.

31:53.480 --> 31:54.766
It's a bit time-sensitive.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.128
I hope it's worth the intrusion.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.681
I can tell you're clearly not
in a business frame of mind...

32:00.840 --> 32:02.365
so I'll keep this very simple.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.120
We have to sweeten the package.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.280
We're gonna see Geiger today.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.811
So, if you drop our lease
fees this year,

32:06.880 --> 32:09.121
we'll double your process
fees next year.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.481
Liar.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.440
I mean what I say,
the numbers are...

32:12.480 --> 32:14.767
You intruded my <i>shvitz</i>
to give me numbers...

32:14.920 --> 32:17.810
and deceive and insult me.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.201
I did not mean to insult you.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.169
You're in our place
of openness...

32:21.320 --> 32:24.642
and to hide your body... Liar.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.489
It's very American.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.524
Are you a shameful pilgrim?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.202
I might be part pilgrim.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.089
You can bring
your numbers here...

32:38.240 --> 32:42.245
but please don't bring
your American prudishness.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.883
It makes me uncomfortable.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.566
Let's get comfortable, Helen.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.843
I dig Europe.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.001
In a big way.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.206
What's not to dig?

32:57.360 --> 32:58.725
The Renaissance.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.966
Sonnets.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.448
Frescoes.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.921
Oil paintings,
paintings of women.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.127
Gorgeous.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.882
Paintings of big women.
Fantastic.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.728
Why did they ever
stop making those?

33:13.960 --> 33:16.327
I'd paint paintings of big
women, if I could paint.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.728
I know you'll be comfortable
with my numbers.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.840
And maybe now you're
a little more comfortable

33:23.920 --> 33:25.445
with this old pilgrim.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.171
Dan Trunkman. Apex Select.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.483
I like what I heard.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.806
I see you brought more pilgrims.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.323
You guys are supposed
to be in the lobby.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.928
We just came to check
if you were okay.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.090
(SOFTLY)
I can see your ball sack.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.010
I'm doing business here, Mike.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.407
MIKE: Oh. Carry on.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.965
It seems we have
an excited pilgrim.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.726
I'm sorry. Are
boners not allowed?

34:00.440 --> 34:02.283
Hopefully, this
is a closed deal.

I love you.

It's gonna dart.

I can't stop. I'm going
a hundred miles an hour.

It's gonna dart
and then you're...

35:17.680 --> 35:18.920
- Right at it?

darting to and fro...

35:56.280 --> 35:57.566
in St. Louis?

35:58.840 --> 36:00.763
No, I'm sorry.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.527
I just imagined
that I was a reindeer...

36:04.720 --> 36:08.770
and I thought about what I would do
in that situation...

Did you narrow this to 17...?
Is that 17%?

36:25.360 --> 36:27.727
Did you get us $1000
of bulk order down?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.770
Yeah, I started working vendors yesterday.
How many did you get down?

36:30.840 --> 36:32.604
39. Yeah.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.569
What'd you do here?
This is much better.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.762
I figured out a way
to fudge our asset charts.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.611
Not fucked up. Just fudged.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.450

is not a horse...

How is it a wheelbarrow again?

is being held up.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.009
He's encircled by men.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.406
Whoa.

51:51.560 --> 51:53.801
This guy went really
gay on his down day.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.411
"Pampelmuse."

51:55.560 --> 51:57.483

you have a PA system?</i>

52:02.920 --> 52:05.685
Is it possible to say his name,

Bill Whilmsley?
Bill Whilmsley?

52:07.760 --> 52:09.920
We're not detectives, we're
just looking for our friend.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.844
Bill Whilmsley. He looks
like kind of a grizzly bear.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.769
(ASKING IN GERMAN)

52:15.080 --> 52:16.650
This is my first
time at a gay bar.

52:16.800 --> 52:17.801
No way. Yeah? Yeah.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.405
Are you not gay? No.

52:19.560 --> 52:21.562
But you guys are having
so much fun.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.246
I don't speak German. Shit.

52:39.400 --> 52:42.802
MAN 1: I was just
asking, still raining?

52:43.760 --> 52:45.762
No, stopped, uh...

52:47.080 --> 52:51.085
I don't know, 40 minutes ago.
It was good seeing you.

52:51.240 --> 52:53.129
MAN 1: Hold on.
Where's the fire?

52:53.280 --> 52:55.601
I know where I am
and I know what this is...

52:55.760 --> 52:57.524
but I didn't know
when I came in here.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.045
I came in here
looking for someone.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.521

Hi, by the way.

Again, I did not come in here
to be with you guys.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.885
Yeah, I liked
that book as a kid.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.361
I don't remember the "sucking guys'
dicks through a wall" part...

53:22.440 --> 53:23.441
but good book.

53:36.400 --> 53:38.482
Houston, we have contact.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.168
It got hard in my hand a little.

53:41.880 --> 53:44.281
MAN 1: Okay, I was just
kidding, but thanks!

53:44.720 --> 53:46.449
So, this guy you
are looking for...

53:46.600 --> 53:48.523
English accent. He
was here 40 minutes ago.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.322
God! Fuck!

53:52.480 --> 53:55.245
MAN 3: I am so sorry.
Did I startle you?

53:55.400 --> 53:57.448
You kind of poked me
in my ass with your dick.

53:57.600 --> 53:59.000
So, yeah, little startled
there, bud.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.168
MAN 3: Sorry. My bad.

Hey, Dan!

54:12.360 --> 54:13.441
What's up?
Not much.

54:13.640 --> 54:16.450
Just got our numbers where we want
them, thought we'd grab a beer.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.284

it's not really...

All right. Will you just give
me a second to sort myself out?

54:40.960 --> 54:43.167
And I will meet you out back.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.321
Great.

54:44.520 --> 54:47.205
Thanks, Bill. You
got a real big one.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.446
Thanks so much for looking
at our numbers tonight, Bill.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.171
Listen, I want you to know...

58:49.280 --> 58:52.966
that it's not my scene,
glory-holing.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.370
But...

58:55.520 --> 58:58.490
it's the only scenario where
I can get any anymore.

58:58.680 --> 59:02.890
I am a pear-shaped,
middle-aged man, Dan.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.566
I've really let
myself go to pot.

59:05.720 --> 59:07.563
And it's work!

59:07.720 --> 59:09.688
You just pack it on.

59:09.840 --> 59:12.047
I started training
to run a marathon

59:12.120 --> 59:13.963
to stay on top of it.

59:14.120 --> 59:15.690
And I told...

59:15.840 --> 59:17.251
Do you wanna hear this? Yes.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.686
Do you wanna hear it? Yes.

59:18.840 --> 59:20.808
I told my whole family...

59:20.960 --> 59:24.089
"I'm running the St. Louis
Marathon this year!"

59:24.240 --> 59:28.643
And I got up to 15 miles
straight in July.

59:28.800 --> 59:31.804
But, man,
with all the travelling

59:31.920 --> 59:33.729
you and I did for this deal...

59:35.000 --> 59:37.321
I started not doing it anymore.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.001
At all.

59:39.480 --> 59:42.006
And that is the problem.

You know, I'm glad
that you're here...

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.323
because it gives me
the chance to tell you...

that we are coming
in strong this morning.

I'm not gonna ask you why,

because that's what you
want me to do.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.841
You're "The Flower Girl"
because you're at the party.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.486
You're dressed up.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.608
Everyone's glad
that you're there.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.364
You do your little thing,
then you sit down,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.885
and you let
the grownups get to it.

But we can't.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.567
Because people don't
shake hands that way.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.251
(SIGHS)

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.121
So, good luck.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.165
We don't need it.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.328
We're prepared. We're Apex.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.961
Fuck me.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.731
Are you just allowed
to come into my room?

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.325
There's an issue. I'm sorry.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.882
We tried to process your credit
card for today's stay.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.691
I'm afraid it's not working.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.848
You can't throw me out. I'm art.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.162
You leaving will be art as well.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.250
So, quick, quick.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.041
What are you doing?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.890
Oh, you're gonna get it!

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.526
Makes me a little uncomfortable

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.840
how much you want it, but...

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.606

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.364

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.281
Shit.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.769
Six minutes.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.126
I gotta go. I gotta go!

<i>I saw, I came, I conquered Or should I say.</i>

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.410
You're good at this. Have
you done this before?

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.241
Coming through!

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.850

that kitty little noogie.</i>

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.649

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.721

<i>Walk this way.</i>

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.290
You told him to meet us here?
Yeah.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.647
Last night, right? Yeah.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.927
Where the fuck is he?

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.483
Maybe he's already there.
I mean, he's a go-getter.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.563
I'm serious. I'm concerned for him.
You should be, too.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.006
I am.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.931
What the fuck is that?

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.571
<i>Fireball.</i>

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.966
Let's do this thing.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.128
Mike, the next time you
wanna run around Berlin...

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.602
playing grab-ass with a Japanese
businessman in a hamster ball...

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.240
you gotta let either me
or your older companion know.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.840
DAN: How are you? I'm good.
How are you?

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.287
Good, Jim. We are excited
to be here at Gelger...

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.967
to present a long-term purchase
and a lend-share cost-buy.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.282
We are ready to meet
your high expectations.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.886
Terrific. Why don't
you all have a seat?

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.280
And we'll get started.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.647
Aren't we gonna pitch Gelger
today, your parent department?

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.609
Austerlitz was gonna
sit in, possibly,

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.205
but he's not gonna be
able to make it today.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.681
I thought Dirk Austerlitz
was our principal.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.487
I thought that we flew here
to see Dirk Austerlitz, Jim.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.200
Dirk and I are working
on this together.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.129
Dirk had to fly to St.
Louis today, so...

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.483
Do you, Jim, know...

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.722
that we all live in St. Louis?

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.491
Oh, wow. Yeah.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.166
We left there to fly
here to see the guy

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.481
that is in St. Louis, Jim.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.687
No shit?

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.651
That's no good.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.730
Well, let's get started.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.487
Where's Bill?

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.690
We covered a lot of this
ground last night with Bill.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.685
We pretty much shook on it.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.365
You can shake hands
with Bill all day long...

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.244
but he doesn't make
our decisions.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.366
Where is Bill?

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.205
Bill's getting my lunch.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.841
You wanna get started?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.401
Okay.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:42.521
Let me gear up my media, and I'll walk
you through our aftermarket.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.964
Great.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.887
So, what was your meeting about?

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.361
Wholesale swarf residue
bargain cost-buys.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.443
"Swarf," is that a real thing?
Yeah, it's a real thing.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.926
What do you think,
we're like Dr. Seuss?

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.367
We're just making up something,
like shit out of thin air?

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.721
No. It's real.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.609
But it's just not interesting.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.091
Well, why do you do it?

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.091
Well...

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.404
I'm gonna send my son
to private school.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.324
Maybe it's worth
it, I'm thinking.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.130
If there's one less
kid in the class...

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.721
then maybe there's one less kid

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.962
to make fun of him
24 hours a day.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.722
Teasing sucks. Yeah.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.723
Have any of you
guys been teased?

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.451
Yeah. I've been teased.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.568
I lived in America for a year.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.564
In Connecticut, and they made
fun of my name.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.000
What's your name?

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.241
Karen.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.851
(LAUGHING)

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.200
Yeah, well, in Sweden
it's like "John,"

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.083
but in Connecticut, it's like...

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.810
"Stacy." Yeah, I can see that.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.167
You know the worst
part with teasing?

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.527
My dad would say,

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.251
"Just forget about it
and ignore it, son."

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.125
But he doesn't understand
because in his day...

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.562
kids would get teased
at school all day,

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.290
but then they could go home.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.408
And nowadays, you come home,

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.801
and there's Facebook
and Instagram...

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.328
and the bullies can get at you
through all of that stuff.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.642
And it never really stops.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.286
It never stops.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.807
When I was a kid, people
could only ridicule me...

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.725
every day until 3:10
in the afternoon.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:23.881

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.564
Okay, Snoop Lion,

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.291
I think it's probably
time to pass that now.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.482
Oh, me? Yes.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.126
Go ahead, Karen.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.884
Pardon me.

Yes. I do know that.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.082
I was having a boob
conversation with Bess...

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.881
<i>and she was worried that her
boobs were gonna come out.</i>

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.486

to Coffee Bean like this.</i>

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.483

Can I talk to her?

out of another kid?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.528
They were making fun of Paul.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.082
They were calling
Paul fat names.

my little can of whoop-ass.

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.801

Yeah. "Straight-Up Teal."

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.763
<i>Why?</i> That's the one that you
picked.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.009
Yeah, when they bagged on me.

<i>See, teal is very outlaw.</i>

It's like, the goth
kids, really...

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.244
they're joiners, when
you think about it.

The teal kids,
they really stand alone.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.011
And whenever I have
to pick a color,

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.481
obviously, I pick
teal every time.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.766
For sure.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.968
Because, you know...

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.851
no one else does it.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.970
And because you have to be bold.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.844
Because you have
to be teal tough.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.324

Yeah, I guess we could.

gonna switch schools.

change anything much, honestly.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.043
See you Monday, pal. Yeah.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.281
See you Monday, Mike.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.646
Bye, guys.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.122
DAN: How are you getting home?

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.409
I'm leaving with a friend.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.043
Is that the, uh,
actual maid from...?

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.248
We kept in touch.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.846
Why is she wearing
her maid outfit?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.162
I asked her nicely, Dan.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.560
Silver fox.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.403
Boom!
I like that.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.521
You remember Dan?

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.641
Hello. Hi. Pleasure.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.926
Nice to meet you.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.082
We should go. Okay.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.241
Great.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.407
Thanks.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.731
Thank you, Tim.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.120
Why are you standing here?

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.720
Don't you have a wheelbarrow you're
supposed to be jumping into?

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.447
Daddy! Hey!

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.931
Oh! (GIGGLES)

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.201
Come on!

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.249
How are you, sweetheart?
I'm good.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.368
Let's go. What do you say?

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.760
You doing good? Yeah!

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.285
All right.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.805
Hey, what's going
on with this guy, here?

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:48.370
You don't get
out of the car anymore?

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.568
What are you, too old?
Hey, Dad.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.926
How are you?
All right.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.605
Come on, let's get going here.

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.603
Good to see you guys. Jump
on in, I'll be in in a minute.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.564
Hi, beautiful. How are you? Hi!

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.410
SUSAN: Good to see you!

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.408
So glad you're back.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.807
It's been a tough week.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.928
How about I drive?
Yes, please.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.486
<i>Flügelschlagen.</i>

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.042
What? Something
I learned on my trip.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.124
It means, "You have
to fight like hell..."

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.051
"but don't forget to catch
your breath now and then..."

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.200
"and realize that everything's gonna
be all right."

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.810
Or it means "turn left," probably.
(LAUGHS)

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.485
Hey, you have your assignment, yes?
Yes.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.961
Because it's due today.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.491
The "Dad" one? Yeah.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.842
Shit. I was still working...

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.526
I wrote it. I did it.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.681
You finished it?

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.761
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.605
SUSAN: It's good.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.170
She wrote it in,
like, two seconds.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.170
(SINGING)
<i>Can you feel?</i>

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.686
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.724
<i>Now it's coming back.</i>

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.211
<i>We can steal it.</i>

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.284
<i>If we bridge this gap.</i>

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.771
<i>I can see you.</i>

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.810
<i>Through the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.604
<i>When I lost it.</i>

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.250
<i>Yeah, you held my hand.</i>

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.925
<i>But I tossed it.</i>

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.729
<i>Didn't understand.</i>

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.211
<i>You were waiting.</i>

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.364
<i>As I dove into the waterfall.</i>

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.642
<i>So say Geronimo!</i>

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.883
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:57.691
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.889
<i>Can you feel...</i>

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.286
<i>my love?</i>

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.728
<i>Bombs away Bombs away.</i>

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.325
<i>Bombs away.</i>

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.686
<i>Say Geronimo!</i>

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.285
<i>Well, we rushed it.</i>

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.925
<i>Moving way too fast.</i>

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.240
<i>That we crushed it.</i>

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.244
<i>But it's in the past.</i>

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.089
<i>We can make this leap.</i>

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.606
<i>Through the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.287
<i>So say Geronimo!</i>

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.360
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.603
<i>Can you feel...</i>

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.486
<i>my love?</i>

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.251
<i>Bombs away Bombs away.</i>

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.810
<i>Bombs away.</i>

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.922
<i>Well, I'm just a boy.</i>

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.445
<i>With a broken toy.</i>

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.170
<i>All lost and coy.</i>

01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.765
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.524
<i>So it's here I stand.</i>

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.204
<i>As a broken man.</i>

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.964
<i>But I've found my friend.</i>

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.883
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.200
<i>Now I'm falling down.</i>

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.930
<i>Through the crashing sound.</i>

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.724
<i>And you've come around.</i>

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.404
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.891
<i>And you rushed to me.</i>

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.729
<i>And it sets us free.</i>

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.404
<i>So I fall to my knees.</i>

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.321
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall.</i>

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.842
<i>When the world is turning
in the wrong direction.</i>

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.483
<i>And every wave seems to be
crashing at your feet.</i>

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.846
<i>Running circles doesn't
lead to inspiration.</i>

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.965
<i>When you're at the end.</i>

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.088
<i>You're at the start again.</i>

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.208
<i>Time's moving too slow.</i>

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.686
<i>One foot out the door.</i>

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:00.648
<i>Binds you flat but know
that you're not alone.</i>

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:06.083
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.846
<i>You know what we'll be,
you'll see.</i>

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.410
<i>If we fall and if we break.</i>

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.687
<i>There will be
another chance today.</i>

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.329
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.802
<i>I believe that we can
find our destination.</i>

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.845
<i>The journey's just begun.</i>

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.567
<i>Two is more than one.</i>

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.567
<i>Time's moving too slow.</i>

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.680
<i>One foot out the door.</i>

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.882
<i>Binds you flat but know
that you're not alone.</i>

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.083
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:58.601
<i>You know what we'll be,
you'll see.</i>

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.649
<i>If we fall and if we break.</i>

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.842
<i>There will be
another chance today.</i>

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.050
<i>Take a hand from me.</i>

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.642
<i>Whoa-oh-oh-oh.</i>

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.364
<i>Take a hand from me</i>
