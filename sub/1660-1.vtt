WEBVTT

03:08.071 --> 03:09.364
Nice ride.

03:10.574 --> 03:11.992
It does the job.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.912
What job, delivering pizzas?

03:16.580 --> 03:19.291
Well, it's not the ride, it's the rider.

03:23.712 --> 03:25.964
- What the hell was that?
- What?

03:26.465 --> 03:28.842
Hey! You talking to my girl?

03:29.134 --> 03:30.969
- Oh, shit. Here we go.
- Yeah.

03:31.261 --> 03:34.306
She was just admiring my ride.

03:34.681 --> 03:35.724
"My ride."

03:35.807 --> 03:39.353
My grandma's Buick could smoke
that piece of shit, trailer trash.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.064
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?

03:43.023 --> 03:46.109
This beast's got 500 horsepower
and a Borla exhaust system.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.570
It does 0 to 60 in like 4.3 seconds...

03:48.654 --> 03:50.364
- That's about right. That's about right.
- Yeah.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.783
Wow. You can read the brochure.

04:15.973 --> 04:18.809
What a pitch, baby. What a pitch.
I like that.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.103
What's he gonna do?

04:21.185 --> 04:23.188
- Let's make it happen.
- Bring it.

04:33.782 --> 04:35.367
I got your back.

04:37.828 --> 04:40.789
Why don't you nice boys let your cars do the talking?

04:42.374 --> 04:44.501
I only race for pink slips.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.296
This car goes for 80 grand.

04:47.379 --> 04:50.590
What would I do
with a broken-ass piece of shit like that?

04:54.928 --> 04:56.430
How about me?

04:59.891 --> 05:03.562
Winner gets me.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.405
Cut it, let's out it. Let's go, go, go, go!

05:27.544 --> 05:30.213
Blast-off, baby!

05:32.758 --> 05:34.801
First one out the other side...

05:35.510 --> 05:38.180
- It's time.
- Let's go!

05:38.263 --> 05:40.682
- Ready, boys?
- Make it interesting, Clay.

06:24.559 --> 06:25.644
Shit!

06:37.197 --> 06:38.323
Yeah!

07:48.310 --> 07:49.936
I thought you loved me.

07:58.236 --> 07:59.446
Oh, Well.

08:10.207 --> 08:11.708
What the hell?

08:21.593 --> 08:23.887
Guess I got a new date for prom.

08:33.772 --> 08:35.941
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

08:44.950 --> 08:46.952
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

08:47.035 --> 08:48.286
Stop it!

08:52.791 --> 08:54.960
Clay, please stop! Please stop!

10:06.114 --> 10:08.158
Can I get a copy of that?

10:10.201 --> 10:12.454
You think this is a joke, huh?

10:13.997 --> 10:15.707
You see Ken and Barbie over there?

10:15.790 --> 10:18.627
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

10:18.710 --> 10:21.171
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.

10:23.965 --> 10:26.176
But I like screw-ups like you.

10:26.259 --> 10:30.639
You know why?
'Cause you're 100% guaranteed conviction.

10:31.056 --> 10:32.891
- Where's my car?
- I crushed it.

10:32.974 --> 10:33.975
You did what?

10:34.059 --> 10:35.143
- Sit down! You're done.
- Easy, easy.

10:35.226 --> 10:36.561
You're done. You understand me?
You're done.

10:36.645 --> 10:38.412
And all before your eighteenth birthday.
Now sit down.

10:41.733 --> 10:42.859
Sean.

10:44.194 --> 10:46.446
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.407
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.618
It's, um...

10:51.743 --> 10:53.078
It's Miss.

10:55.497 --> 10:59.751
Officer, is it illegal to smoke in here?

11:07.759 --> 11:11.137
It's a tough state.
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.475
He'll be lucky if they don't try him as an adult.

11:17.394 --> 11:20.355
This is our third town in two years.

11:21.481 --> 11:25.610
Your son's got two priors for reckless
driving, willful destruction of property.

11:25.694 --> 11:27.654
This makes it strike three.

11:27.737 --> 11:30.365
They're definitely gonna want to get him off the streets.

11:30.448 --> 11:33.284
Well, there's just got to be another way.

11:42.085 --> 11:44.504
So, where are we moving this time?

11:47.090 --> 11:49.175
We are not moving anywhere.

13:44.415 --> 13:45.500
Sean.

13:46.543 --> 13:48.419
I thought you were gonna be here on the 7th.

13:48.503 --> 13:50.129
Today is the 7th.

13:51.548 --> 13:54.092
Well, look, just hold on one second.

14:20.368 --> 14:21.786
Come on in.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.167
This is it.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.927
You know, Sean, I was gonna be there.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.055
But your mom, she said the 7th, see,

14:41.139 --> 14:43.766
and we're a day ahead of you in Japan.

14:45.810 --> 14:48.980
Well, you're here now, and that's good.

14:50.481 --> 14:52.650
So, how is your mom?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.321
Where do I sleep?

14:57.155 --> 14:59.365
Now, Sean, you know she had no other choice.

14:59.449 --> 15:02.160
I mean, it was either this or juvi hall,

15:03.369 --> 15:07.415
I mean, you just can't keep moving away
every time you get into trouble.

15:07.498 --> 15:09.042
Worked for you.

15:12.503 --> 15:14.839
Look, neither of us asked for this.

15:15.465 --> 15:18.384
But I promised your mom I'd take care of you.

15:18.801 --> 15:21.846
So you just go by the rules her and I agreed to,

15:21.930 --> 15:24.974
- ...and I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
- Rules?

15:25.558 --> 15:28.186
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.898
You go to school, you come back here right after.

15:32.190 --> 15:36.027
And I don't want to see or hear
about you anywhere near a car.

15:38.196 --> 15:40.323
Here, the bedroom is yours.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.164
Make yourself comfortable.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.251
Lights out in 10.

16:52.270 --> 16:53.896
You got to be kidding.

17:51.245 --> 17:53.081
- Wrong train.
- Huh?

17:53.164 --> 17:54.665
I'm new here.

17:59.670 --> 18:01.464
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

18:28.449 --> 18:29.617
<i>Uwabaki.</i>

19:02.233 --> 19:04.527
Japanese food is like the Army.

19:05.153 --> 19:07.029
Don't ask, don't tell.

19:08.239 --> 19:11.701
Name's Twinkie.
Hey, I noticed you ain't have a laptop.

19:13.578 --> 19:14.745
Yeah?

19:15.246 --> 19:17.456
I'll hook you up. Half price.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.001
No, I'm cool.

19:20.084 --> 19:23.379
60% off.
Since we're both army brats and everything.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.299
I ain't got no cash, man.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.176
And I ain't an army brat.

19:28.259 --> 19:31.596
All right, all right.
Well, what about a cell phone, huh?

19:32.263 --> 19:34.473
Everybody needs a cell phone.

19:34.765 --> 19:36.100
No offense,

19:36.434 --> 19:40.188
but I'm probably not gonna be here
long enough to remember your name.

19:40.271 --> 19:43.691
Then you gonna need some new shoes to book town with, man.

19:43.774 --> 19:46.861
You like Michael Jordan?
I love Michael Jordan.

19:48.112 --> 19:49.655
Check this out.

19:49.947 --> 19:52.491
Brand new Jordans. Not even out yet.

19:52.575 --> 19:55.786
LeBron James couldn't even get his hands on those.

19:57.455 --> 19:59.999
You selling that Sparco steering wheel?

20:00.082 --> 20:02.501
Hell, no. That's mine right there.

20:02.793 --> 20:05.129
Man, I even paid retail for it.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.173
What you drive?

20:07.256 --> 20:08.716
- My ride?
- Yeah.

20:08.799 --> 20:11.260
- My ride's one of a kind.
- Show me.

20:12.303 --> 20:14.847
Thought you weren't sticking around.

20:15.598 --> 20:16.807
All right.

21:08.693 --> 21:11.779
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.

21:11.862 --> 21:12.863
Ooh!

21:13.823 --> 21:15.700
At least let me drive.

21:15.866 --> 21:18.244
Y'all better have some real cars around here.

21:18.327 --> 21:21.706
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh? Well, all right.

21:21.956 --> 21:24.000
I don't know if you're ready for them, though.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.127
You look a little nervous.

21:26.669 --> 21:28.212
What up, Tosh?

22:02.747 --> 22:05.082
For when you blow your wad, man.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.766
Hear that?

23:03.849 --> 23:05.643
It's still not right for the way I drive.

23:05.726 --> 23:08.437
'Cause the way you drive is wrong!
See?

23:08.521 --> 23:10.940
I don't need a computer
to tell me about my throttle response.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.442
Okay. Then we're done here.

23:16.112 --> 23:18.906
You wouldn't have that problem with a V8.

23:19.698 --> 23:20.825
Boys.

23:20.950 --> 23:24.286
All they care about is who's got the biggest engine.

23:24.954 --> 23:27.164
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.

23:28.582 --> 23:32.253
So y'all race with these things, huh?
Cute little toys.

23:33.921 --> 23:37.133
You know, I almost didn't recognize you
without your slippers on.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.135
<i>Don't you mean uwabaki?</i>

23:40.344 --> 23:41.804
Neela, right?

23:42.555 --> 23:44.473
You're a quick learner.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.936
So, where you from, anyway?

23:49.019 --> 23:50.187
Here.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.983
No, I mean, not where you live.
Where'd you come from?

23:54.066 --> 23:56.360
Does it really matter where I'm from?

24:03.993 --> 24:05.661
Who's the tourist?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.583
What's with you and the schoolgirls, D?

24:10.666 --> 24:13.878
You're moving up in the world.
You gotta elevate your company.

24:13.961 --> 24:17.047
Wednesday, Wednesday, meet Thursday.
God. Girl.

24:21.427 --> 24:24.638
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?
All right, beautiful. Hold up.

24:27.141 --> 24:28.392
He was just leaving.

24:33.147 --> 24:35.566
I'm sorry. I don't speak Japanese.

24:39.069 --> 24:42.031
<i>Understand that'? Gaijin?</i>

24:42.114 --> 24:43.365
Takashi.

24:43.908 --> 24:45.451
We were just talking.

24:45.534 --> 24:47.411
This isn't your scene.

24:48.245 --> 24:52.374
That word you called me, gaijin or something or other,

24:52.958 --> 24:55.085
what does that mean exactly?

24:55.961 --> 24:58.547
Means, turn around,

24:59.632 --> 25:00.841
keep walking.

25:00.925 --> 25:03.385
That's exactly what we gonna do.
Come on, man, let's roll.

25:03.469 --> 25:04.929
Yo, look, man, he's yakuza.

25:05.012 --> 25:07.973
Now, see, that's funny,

25:08.057 --> 25:11.101
'cause I thought this was, like, a free country

25:11.936 --> 25:14.897
where a girl could talk to whoever she wants.

25:17.983 --> 25:19.902
You know who I am, boy?

25:20.236 --> 25:24.448
Yeah. You're like
the Justin Timberlake of Japan, right?

25:30.287 --> 25:31.455
Leave.

25:31.622 --> 25:34.750
Damn, man. You know yakuza? The Mafia?

25:36.961 --> 25:40.548
Look, sorry, DK-san.
Monkey didn't have his banana today.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.341
Hey, D, let's go.

25:42.424 --> 25:43.884
It's time to race.

25:47.972 --> 25:49.848
Good luck, Timberlake.

25:58.440 --> 26:02.194
You're the one that's lucky, 'cause I'm about to race.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.991
Then let's race.

26:09.743 --> 26:12.830
With what, huh? Your skateboard?

26:15.040 --> 26:17.835
Easy to sound cocky when you got no ride.

26:18.502 --> 26:19.837
Take mine.

26:23.966 --> 26:25.342
Let's race.

26:29.346 --> 26:31.974
What? I wanna see what the kid's got.

26:38.689 --> 26:40.190
Can he drive?

26:41.275 --> 26:42.735
Can he drive?

26:44.737 --> 26:46.864
You know what DK stands for?

26:47.865 --> 26:49.241
Donkey Kong?

26:49.700 --> 26:51.035
Drift King.

26:52.703 --> 26:53.871
Drift?

26:54.830 --> 26:56.790
What do you mean, drift?

27:09.511 --> 27:11.513
Still need a dictionary?

27:11.930 --> 27:13.557
You know that real famous painting?

27:13.641 --> 27:16.018
The one of the woman who's smiling all the time?

27:16.101 --> 27:18.312
<i>- The Mona Lisa.
- Right, right, right. Mona Lisa.</i>

27:18.395 --> 27:21.774
<i>Well, look, man, this car right here's
like the Mona Lisa of the drift world.</i>

27:21.857 --> 27:24.568
Han rebuilt this bad boy from ground up.

27:24.652 --> 27:29.156
We talking forged pistons,
bigger turbo, new rods, new crankshaft.

27:30.199 --> 27:33.494
Hey, man, Han's labor ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

27:34.536 --> 27:37.790
Well, if I needed a 30-second lesson
on how to drift...

27:37.873 --> 27:40.542
All right, look, man, there's lots of ways
you can do this, all right?

27:40.626 --> 27:41.710
Hand braking is the easiest,

27:41.794 --> 27:44.171
so the first thing I want you to do,
I want you to rip that e-brake.

27:44.254 --> 27:47.925
All right, after you rip the e-brake,
then I want you to power over.

27:48.842 --> 27:52.012
You know what?
Just don't mess up Mona, all right?

27:52.096 --> 27:53.430
All right.

28:47.401 --> 28:48.569
Ready.

28:49.987 --> 28:51.071
Set.

28:53.991 --> 28:54.992
Go!

29:35.783 --> 29:37.159
I told you.

30:18.075 --> 30:19.243
Damn it!

30:21.453 --> 30:22.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:06.039 --> 31:07.207
Damn it!

32:48.850 --> 32:50.477
Don't leave town.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.245
Do you know what time it is?

33:08.412 --> 33:10.580
I thought it was around 7:00.

33:11.289 --> 33:13.959
You know, US is a few hours behind.

33:16.878 --> 33:19.798
Looks like the party was better here, anyway.

33:22.676 --> 33:24.761
Have you been racing, Sean?

33:28.849 --> 33:30.600
You're out of here.

33:34.104 --> 33:35.355
Go ahead.

33:36.940 --> 33:38.650
You don't get it, do you?

33:38.734 --> 33:40.861
You have nowhere else to go.

33:41.278 --> 33:45.407
If it doesn't work out here,
you're going to jail. Do you get that?

33:48.160 --> 33:52.039
This isn't a game.
And I'm gonna tell you one more time,

33:52.414 --> 33:56.960
if you're gonna live under my roof,
you're gonna go by my rules or get out.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.212
Understand?

34:00.380 --> 34:01.757
Understand?

34:02.841 --> 34:04.134
Yes, sir.

34:54.768 --> 34:56.018
Get in.

34:56.645 --> 34:58.605
I'll get you your money.

34:59.147 --> 35:01.858
Why you talking like you have a choice?

35:15.622 --> 35:19.084
There's a guy in there with a paw that owes me some money.

35:19.167 --> 35:20.335
A Paw?

35:21.878 --> 35:23.630
Go get me my money.

35:26.383 --> 35:27.509
Okay.

36:21.521 --> 36:23.899
Han said,

36:25.567 --> 36:27.027
<i>okane.</i>

36:35.118 --> 36:37.621
<i>Han send, okane.</i>

37:06.566 --> 37:07.859
Let's go.

37:15.825 --> 37:18.870
You're in the pickup and delivery business now.

37:18.954 --> 37:21.539
I might call you once a week or once an hour.

37:21.623 --> 37:24.918
I don't care if you're sick as a dog
or in bed with BeyoncÃ©.

37:25.001 --> 37:26.670
I call, you show.

37:27.754 --> 37:31.591
- Only if you teach me how to drift.
- This ain't a negotiation.

37:32.008 --> 37:33.802
I wasn't negotiating.

38:22.225 --> 38:24.019
What's he doing here?

38:24.102 --> 38:28.064
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can sitting in my garage.

38:28.148 --> 38:30.025
Hope he's not driving.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.321
<i>Gaijin.</i>

38:35.572 --> 38:39.034
When is your next race?
I'd really like to be there.

38:40.577 --> 38:41.995
Why not be in it?

38:42.078 --> 38:46.541
You really a bad ass, cowboy, or you just talk like one?

38:47.208 --> 38:48.668
You heard me.

38:49.586 --> 38:51.921
Ready to lose another car, Han?

38:52.297 --> 38:55.550
I'm ready to take that '86 Corolla off your hands.

38:57.427 --> 38:58.762
All right.

38:59.095 --> 39:01.014
Put up the '72 Skyline.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.266
Done.

39:05.268 --> 39:07.437
What do you think, Morimoto?

39:10.857 --> 39:12.609
Get him out of here.

39:13.443 --> 39:15.570
We have business to discuss.

39:25.622 --> 39:27.415
Your shipment's late.

39:27.499 --> 39:30.627
Since when are you so worried about the details?

39:32.504 --> 39:35.006
When is the shipment arriving, Han?

39:36.508 --> 39:39.135
Just sit pretty and let me handle it.

40:01.116 --> 40:02.784
Hey, Dad, it's me.

40:03.076 --> 40:06.996
I had to stay after school
for some extracurricular activities.

40:07.414 --> 40:09.416
So I'll be home a little later.

40:11.876 --> 40:12.961
Sir.

40:15.338 --> 40:18.258
You really need to stop following me around.

40:18.341 --> 40:20.343
What are you doing here?

40:20.593 --> 40:24.931
I thought I'd stop by and ask your boyfriend
for some drifting lessons.

40:25.223 --> 40:28.435
Trust me.
You don't wanna be a part of this world.

40:28.935 --> 40:30.645
It's good enough for you.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.730
You don't know anything about me.

40:32.814 --> 40:35.108
Well, why don't you think I know?

40:35.191 --> 40:37.569
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?

40:39.195 --> 40:40.697
Let me guess.

40:41.197 --> 40:43.867
You're an army brat who moved around a lot.

40:43.950 --> 40:46.453
Your mama and daddy was never home.

40:46.536 --> 40:49.456
So you walked around pissed off all the time.

40:49.539 --> 40:52.876
And now you found your family with these drift nuts.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.381
Zero for one, cowboy.

41:10.018 --> 41:14.189
Why can't you go find a nice Japanese girl
like the rest of the white guys around here?

41:19.861 --> 41:22.113
Is everything okay back there?

41:22.906 --> 41:24.532
I can handle DK.

41:25.492 --> 41:27.368
<i>I thought he's yakuza.</i>

41:28.036 --> 41:29.746
<i>His uncle's yakuza.</i>

41:30.788 --> 41:34.250
He's just playing gangster in his little storage room.

41:37.086 --> 41:38.671
But I need him.

41:39.422 --> 41:42.592
He keeps Uncle Kamata from poking around too much.

41:43.092 --> 41:44.761
What do you mean?

41:45.762 --> 41:49.390
Well, his uncle gets a piece of the action
from everyone on his turf.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.142
We're on his turf.

41:52.393 --> 41:55.605
50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.

41:58.107 --> 41:59.943
So have you raced DK?

42:00.693 --> 42:02.820
Why not? Is he that good?

42:03.321 --> 42:05.448
What's the point of a race?

42:06.449 --> 42:08.910
To see if I'm better than the other guy.

42:08.993 --> 42:11.037
Just proves you're faster, that's all.

42:11.120 --> 42:14.541
If I were to race, it would have to be
for something important.

42:14.624 --> 42:16.626
Or why else do it at all?

42:18.920 --> 42:20.880
Why are you letting me race?

42:20.964 --> 42:23.174
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.469
And you owe me a car.

42:49.158 --> 42:50.285
Oh, shit.

42:57.792 --> 42:58.960
What the...

42:59.043 --> 43:01.629
Police cars here are only factory-tuned.

43:01.713 --> 43:06.301
You can do better than 180 k,
they can't catch you, so they don't even try.

43:08.344 --> 43:12.015
You know what?
I'm beginning to like this country already.

43:27.822 --> 43:28.990
Danny!

43:29.907 --> 43:31.701
You're looking good.

43:34.871 --> 43:36.039
Disco.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.465
We gotta catch up.
Get you a drink on me, huh?

43:45.548 --> 43:46.841
Let's go.

44:00.396 --> 44:01.397
Uh-oh.

44:01.689 --> 44:03.316
Easy now, ladies.

44:06.319 --> 44:07.570
Come on.

44:11.324 --> 44:13.660
What's up? How you doing?

44:13.743 --> 44:15.078
Hey, baby.

44:33.596 --> 44:36.808
Keep your hands off the kid, girls.
He's underage.

44:39.018 --> 44:42.814
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Disneyland for grownups, huh?

44:42.980 --> 44:45.858
- All these girls, man, they look like...
- What, models?

44:45.942 --> 44:47.026
Check it out.

44:47.110 --> 44:50.279
See, Tokyo is the fashion capital
on this side of the planet, all right?

44:50.363 --> 44:53.241
Now, imagine you been posing all day.
I mean, that's a lot of hard work.

44:53.324 --> 44:54.909
Not only do you get tired, but, on top of that,

44:54.992 --> 44:58.538
you wanna have a little fun, but you can't
'cause you don't even know nobody in town.

44:58.621 --> 45:01.874
And most of the guys around here are
too chicken shit to even try picking up one.

45:01.958 --> 45:03.626
So what do you do?

45:04.502 --> 45:07.714
Man, you talk to the little dude who makes you laugh.

45:07.797 --> 45:08.881
Yeah.

45:09.799 --> 45:13.511
Look, man, I don't just think outside the box.
I tear it up.

45:13.594 --> 45:15.179
That's my thing.

45:15.304 --> 45:16.305
Yo!

45:23.396 --> 45:24.480
Sean!

46:09.525 --> 46:11.277
The red Evo's yours.

46:23.247 --> 46:24.874
What do you mean?

46:25.708 --> 46:27.293
You're representing me now.

46:27.376 --> 46:30.379
What you think, I'm gonna let you roll in a Hyundai?

46:56.239 --> 46:57.448
Oh, man.

47:02.995 --> 47:04.080
Damn it.

47:04.580 --> 47:06.916
You call that drifting?

47:09.585 --> 47:13.381
My mother, she's blind in one eye
and she can drift better than that.

47:16.217 --> 47:18.302
Han, where did you find this guy?

47:19.512 --> 47:22.265
Will someone please teach this guy how to drift?

47:45.955 --> 47:47.456
Is that yours?

47:48.457 --> 47:49.750
Sure is.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.593
What happened?

47:59.844 --> 48:03.264
I don't know. I found it this way at the base.

48:07.268 --> 48:08.728
It's got potential.

48:13.649 --> 48:15.985
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

48:20.740 --> 48:23.576
You know, Sean, the Japanese have a saying.

48:26.704 --> 48:29.165
"The nail that sticks out gets hammered."

48:33.210 --> 48:35.004
You're gonna be late.

48:46.641 --> 48:47.725
Sean!

49:07.036 --> 49:09.705
That's for selling me a broken iPod!

49:09.872 --> 49:11.707
Come on, man, you broke it.

49:16.754 --> 49:18.130
Hey, whoa, whoa.

49:19.048 --> 49:21.217
There must be a misunderstanding.

49:21.884 --> 49:25.012
Out of my way, or you're next.

49:25.096 --> 49:28.015
- Take it easy.
- Look, man, I don't do refunds, all right?

49:28.099 --> 49:30.393
Okay, let's go, then! Let's go!

49:30.726 --> 49:32.144
Touch me again...

49:35.856 --> 49:36.941
Here.

49:38.067 --> 49:40.069
Try not to break this one.

49:54.458 --> 49:57.086
Say, man!
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

49:57.169 --> 50:00.006
Now everybody's gonna want exchanges around here.

50:00.089 --> 50:01.173
Damn!

50:13.769 --> 50:16.105
Not easy saving the day, is it?

50:16.856 --> 50:19.734
Maybe you could give me some pointers sometime.

50:19.817 --> 50:21.485
You're doing all right.

50:22.611 --> 50:23.779
Thanks.

50:27.283 --> 50:28.367
Hey.

50:29.577 --> 50:30.661
Yeah?

50:31.704 --> 50:33.831
Sorry about the other night.

50:34.457 --> 50:36.792
Your life isn't any of my business.

50:38.377 --> 50:39.754
It's okay.

51:02.068 --> 51:03.152
Foul!

51:04.320 --> 51:05.863
- Ain't no damn foul.
- That was a foul.

51:05.946 --> 51:07.323
- Yo, you in my face.
- That was a foul.

51:07.406 --> 51:09.909
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.

51:09.992 --> 51:11.243
A wanker?

51:11.327 --> 51:13.537
What do I look like, a zebra?

51:20.252 --> 51:22.838
So, how did you end up over here, anyway?

51:23.964 --> 51:26.342
Well, you know those old Westerns

51:27.051 --> 51:29.970
where the cowboys make a run for the border?

51:32.640 --> 51:34.350
This is my Mexico.

51:38.020 --> 51:40.564
Why'd you let me race with your car?

51:40.689 --> 51:42.942
You knew I was gonna wreck it.

51:43.526 --> 51:44.777
Why not?

51:46.028 --> 51:48.114
'Cause it's a lot of money.

51:48.197 --> 51:49.698
I have money.

51:51.033 --> 51:53.869
It's trust and character I need around me.

51:55.538 --> 51:59.708
You know, who you choose to be around
you lets you know who you are.

52:01.752 --> 52:05.339
And one car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of,

52:05.673 --> 52:07.967
that's a price I can live with.

52:12.179 --> 52:14.723
Look at all those people down there.

52:15.391 --> 52:17.726
They follow the rules, for what?

52:19.019 --> 52:21.313
They're letting fear lead them.

52:23.232 --> 52:25.359
What happens if they don't?

52:26.068 --> 52:30.406
Life's simple.
You make choices and you don't look back.

52:45.379 --> 52:48.757
<i>So, if you don't drift to win, what do you drift for?</i>

52:49.550 --> 52:52.178
<i>- You really want to know?
- Yeah.</i>

52:53.012 --> 52:54.555
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

54:11.966 --> 54:14.510
<i>There's no "wax on, wax off" with drifting.</i>

54:14.927 --> 54:16.345
Learn by doing it.

54:17.263 --> 54:21.433
The first drifters invented drifting
out here in the mountains by feeling it.

54:21.767 --> 54:23.143
So feel it.

54:35.739 --> 54:36.907
Again!

54:39.243 --> 54:41.704
- What's in this bag?
- You'll see.

54:42.079 --> 54:45.082
How much you got?
Keep going, keep going.

54:51.547 --> 54:54.133
I'm so good, man, I could sell rubbers to a monk.

54:59.221 --> 55:00.222
Again.

55:22.369 --> 55:23.537
Again.

55:32.963 --> 55:35.716
Watch it. Watch it. Not too early, now.

55:41.388 --> 55:43.349
Go, go, go, go!

55:52.858 --> 55:54.693
Not bad.

55:54.860 --> 55:56.779
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

56:34.733 --> 56:35.984
Hey Han...

56:36.819 --> 56:38.445
Take a look at this.

56:42.074 --> 56:43.534
You have a visitor.

56:48.330 --> 56:51.792
Hey, Twink. Get this man a bunk.

58:06.658 --> 58:08.368
Pleasure doing business.

58:12.206 --> 58:15.209
Yeah, baby. I told you. I told you, didn't I?

58:54.873 --> 58:58.794
It's actually not bad.
I didn't even have to put ketchup on it.

58:59.878 --> 59:02.005
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

59:03.799 --> 59:07.886
I hate that word. It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

59:09.304 --> 59:11.515
I thought you were born here.

59:11.598 --> 59:14.685
Well, "outsider" can mean many different things.

59:19.982 --> 59:22.025
My mom died when I was 10.

59:23.402 --> 59:26.863
She came out here from Australia
when she finished high school.

59:26.989 --> 59:31.076
And all I know about her is
that she went to work in a hostess bar.

59:34.204 --> 59:36.331
DK's grandmother took me in.

59:39.501 --> 59:42.379
Well, my parents split up when I was three.

59:43.589 --> 59:47.259
Me and Mom moved around a lot.
Mostly 'cause of me.

59:48.927 --> 59:51.263
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

59:53.181 --> 59:55.684
Kind of made myself an outsider, you know,

59:55.892 --> 59:58.186
without even thinking about it.

01:00:00.314 --> 01:00:04.318
But I realize now, outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:08.196
All that matters is knowing what you really want

01:00:09.197 --> 01:00:10.907
and going after it.

01:00:31.053 --> 01:00:33.847
We used to come up here when we were kids.

01:00:34.306 --> 01:00:37.643
Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out,

01:00:37.726 --> 01:00:40.270
come up here, and watch the older kids drift.

01:00:46.985 --> 01:00:49.029
Things were different back then.

01:00:53.075 --> 01:00:55.911
Once I got my license, I practically lived up here.

01:00:56.495 --> 01:00:59.081
Back then, kids just drove whatever they had.

01:00:59.247 --> 01:01:01.917
You know, we just made do.
No one bothered us.

01:01:03.335 --> 01:01:07.422
The day I got my license
is the day I got my first speeding ticket.

01:01:07.506 --> 01:01:09.925
The day after that, I won my first race.

01:01:10.425 --> 01:01:12.969
I beat this rich kid by three lengths.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.723
I gotta admit, it felt good.

01:01:18.517 --> 01:01:19.810
It felt like...

01:01:20.102 --> 01:01:22.312
Like everything else just disappears.

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:27.484
- No past and no future.
- No problems.

01:01:29.861 --> 01:01:31.446
Just the moment.

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:56.638
Boy needs to chill.

01:01:59.141 --> 01:02:01.351
Hey, Twink, I'm gonna grab another set.

01:02:01.435 --> 01:02:03.687
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Another set?

01:02:03.979 --> 01:02:08.108
No. Look, that was your third set today.
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.

01:02:18.493 --> 01:02:22.080
DK, grab a chair.
We're about to roast some marshmallows.

01:02:23.123 --> 01:02:24.833
Yo, come on, man, look...

01:02:37.179 --> 01:02:38.930
Stay away from her,

01:02:39.139 --> 01:02:42.434
or the only thing you'll be driving is a wheelchair.

01:02:48.482 --> 01:02:50.275
Find yourself a new driver.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.540
- I'm all right.
- What'd you expect?

01:03:06.333 --> 01:03:10.003
You didn't just play with fire,
you soaked the matches in gasoline.

01:03:33.401 --> 01:03:34.736
It's over.

01:03:55.507 --> 01:03:58.844
- All this over a gaijin?
- I am a gaijin.

01:04:01.763 --> 01:04:03.473
You've changed, DK.

01:04:08.854 --> 01:04:10.647
You say I've changed.

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:15.610
But we're not so different, you and I.

01:04:16.903 --> 01:04:19.739
We're both products of screw ups, aren't we?

01:04:25.745 --> 01:04:28.999
They say your mom was the best trick

01:04:29.082 --> 01:04:31.626
in all of Kabukicho back in the day.

01:04:32.127 --> 01:04:33.753
Leave my mother out of this.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:37.257
If we hadn't taken you in, you'd be just like her,

01:04:38.133 --> 01:04:40.176
doing anything for a buck.

01:04:41.303 --> 01:04:45.307
Think anyone would take a second look
at you if it wasn't for your uncle?

01:04:58.904 --> 01:05:00.780
We're the same, Neela.

01:05:04.659 --> 01:05:07.829
Difference is I know who I am and where I belong.

01:05:13.752 --> 01:05:15.712
Do you know who you are?

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:22.052
Do you know where you belong?

01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:42.364
Hey.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.662
Come on.

01:06:32.316 --> 01:06:33.317
Uncle.

01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:39.490
Uncle Kamata, I was just about to go see you.

01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:42.785
Have you been well?

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:43.869
Yes.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.664
Here's last week's take.

01:06:47.957 --> 01:06:51.335
Business good?

01:06:53.337 --> 01:06:54.463
Please.

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:06.808
To tell you the truth...

01:07:09.937 --> 01:07:12.314
I look over these printouts of yours...

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:17.277
and I don't understand half of what I'm looking at.

01:07:19.196 --> 01:07:21.532
It looks more complicated than it is.

01:07:23.784 --> 01:07:28.163
Then how is it even I am able to figure out...

01:07:30.082 --> 01:07:35.671
that your partner is stealing from us?

01:07:39.091 --> 01:07:40.842
Even if that were true...

01:07:41.718 --> 01:07:45.597
It couldn't have been much, uncle.
I would've caught it.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.145
There's an old saying:

01:07:53.939 --> 01:07:55.899
For want of a nail...

01:07:56.441 --> 01:07:58.443
the horseshoe was lost.

01:08:00.112 --> 01:08:03.532
For want of a horseshoe, the steed was lost.

01:08:04.616 --> 01:08:06.535
For want of a steed...

01:08:07.703 --> 01:08:09.746
the message was not delivered.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.792
For want of an undelivered message...

01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:17.879
the war was lost.

01:08:34.062 --> 01:08:37.274
I miss your father.

01:09:33.788 --> 01:09:35.040
Hey, brother.

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:39.252
I vouched for you!
Put my reputation on the line for you!

01:09:39.502 --> 01:09:40.837
We were partners!

01:09:41.254 --> 01:09:44.091
You think you can keep your side deals from me?

01:09:44.174 --> 01:09:47.094
Come on. We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

01:09:47.928 --> 01:09:50.346
- This is what we do.
- Takashi!

01:09:57.521 --> 01:09:59.064
What about now?

01:09:59.314 --> 01:10:00.482
Hmm?

01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:02.943
Is this what we do?

01:10:04.486 --> 01:10:06.113
Man, you need me.

01:10:06.363 --> 01:10:09.908
You'd still be shaking down tea houses
for chump change if it wasn't for me.

01:10:19.418 --> 01:10:22.212
- Get in!
- Go! Go! Go!

01:10:26.258 --> 01:10:27.509
Come on.

01:13:49.127 --> 01:13:50.503
Sean, Sean!

01:16:36.211 --> 01:16:37.212
Takashi.

01:16:37.796 --> 01:16:38.797
Get in.

01:16:46.554 --> 01:16:48.723
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:16:59.109 --> 01:17:00.235
Okay.

01:17:01.444 --> 01:17:02.821
I'll go with you.

01:17:03.321 --> 01:17:04.489
Neela.

01:17:15.542 --> 01:17:17.877
See you when Daddy's not around.

01:17:41.359 --> 01:17:43.528
- I'm putting you on a plane tonight.
- Dad...

01:17:43.611 --> 01:17:45.238
Sean, don't argue with me.

01:17:45.321 --> 01:17:48.116
I did this. I can't run away.

01:17:49.284 --> 01:17:50.285
I can't.

01:17:50.368 --> 01:17:54.080
Sean, I'm your father.
I'm responsible for your well-being.

01:17:54.622 --> 01:17:56.666
And I'm responsible for my mess.

01:17:59.794 --> 01:18:01.588
I gotta do this.

01:18:03.798 --> 01:18:05.758
Can you understand that?

01:18:21.816 --> 01:18:24.527
At least you're not redoing my mistakes.

01:18:53.264 --> 01:18:55.016
You all right, man?

01:18:58.895 --> 01:19:02.232
We're leaving town.
Look, I know some people...

01:19:04.317 --> 01:19:06.110
I can't do it, Twink.

01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.156
Look, DK wants your head.

01:19:11.032 --> 01:19:12.367
All right?

01:19:12.784 --> 01:19:17.080
And the trouble you just made for Kamata?
You're done here, bro.

01:19:19.624 --> 01:19:23.044
- Maybe I should talk to Kamata.
- What?

01:19:24.587 --> 01:19:26.256
DK answers to him.

01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:31.344
I know I just didn't hear that.

01:19:33.346 --> 01:19:36.724
I gotta end this. I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:19:36.808 --> 01:19:38.810
What, are you crazy, huh?

01:19:39.018 --> 01:19:40.603
Han is dead, all right!

01:19:40.687 --> 01:19:43.690
Plus, you can't just walk into Kamata's place, man!

01:19:46.818 --> 01:19:48.361
It's all I got.

01:19:54.951 --> 01:19:58.121
Something I think Han would've wanted you to have.

01:20:12.719 --> 01:20:14.137
What's this?

01:20:15.763 --> 01:20:20.184
You're gonna need it if you're gonna
make it out of Kamata's place alive.

01:20:23.271 --> 01:20:24.939
Don't you need it?

01:20:26.649 --> 01:20:30.153
No, it's cool. Look, I'll figure it out.

01:21:03.853 --> 01:21:07.148
I'd like to see Mr. Kamata, please.

01:21:40.056 --> 01:21:41.140
Sean.

01:21:45.895 --> 01:21:47.563
You need to leave.

01:21:47.897 --> 01:21:50.024
You came to the wrong place.

01:21:50.191 --> 01:21:52.402
I didn't come here to see you.

01:21:52.819 --> 01:21:54.070
Takashi.

01:21:54.904 --> 01:21:56.614
Who's your friend?

01:21:58.241 --> 01:21:59.242
Nobody.

01:22:00.284 --> 01:22:01.702
I can handle this.

01:22:02.495 --> 01:22:05.790
I have something which belongs to you, sir.

01:22:22.682 --> 01:22:23.933
You think

01:22:25.017 --> 01:22:29.564
you can walk in here, dump some cash and walk out?

01:22:31.691 --> 01:22:35.736
I know I'm only returning what belonged
to you in the first place, sir.

01:22:37.238 --> 01:22:39.449
But that's not why I really came.

01:22:40.116 --> 01:22:42.118
I came here to apologize.

01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:47.999
I know your nephew and I have embarrassed ourselves badly.

01:22:48.124 --> 01:22:50.126
Don't listen to this gaijin.

01:22:51.461 --> 01:22:52.503
Takashi...

01:22:54.005 --> 01:22:56.883
after everything you've done, you're giving me orders?

01:22:56.966 --> 01:22:58.134
I apologize.

01:22:59.969 --> 01:23:03.764
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.

01:23:06.392 --> 01:23:08.853
How do you plan to accomplish that?

01:23:10.313 --> 01:23:11.481
A race.

01:23:16.694 --> 01:23:20.823
DK and I have caused nothing but problems for you, for us.

01:23:22.575 --> 01:23:26.537
And I'm asking you to allow us to settle this,
once and for all.

01:23:28.372 --> 01:23:29.582
We race

01:23:31.334 --> 01:23:33.419
and the loser leaves town for good.

01:23:33.503 --> 01:23:36.339
I've already beat this piece of shit once!

01:23:36.506 --> 01:23:37.632
Good.

01:23:38.591 --> 01:23:41.010
Then it should be easy.

01:24:19.549 --> 01:24:21.676
The cops took all the cars.

01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:23.010
Hey!

01:25:39.503 --> 01:25:41.213
That's why she's spitting.

01:26:04.654 --> 01:26:08.199
We almost there, Twink.
Couple more tweaks.

01:26:09.742 --> 01:26:12.119
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.

01:26:13.496 --> 01:26:16.999
DK picked this road for a reason.
This is his mountain.

01:26:19.502 --> 01:26:22.630
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.

01:30:16.571 --> 01:30:17.655
Yeah!

01:30:24.913 --> 01:30:26.581
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.141
Come on.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.611
Yeah! Come on!

01:31:38.695 --> 01:31:41.322
- Come on, Sean.
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:31:41.406 --> 01:31:43.032
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

01:32:11.477 --> 01:32:13.730
Damn! Come on, man! That ain't right.

01:34:23.818 --> 01:34:25.862
Yeah, baby!
That's what I'm talking about, man.

01:34:25.945 --> 01:34:27.322
I told you!

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.435
You're free to go.

01:35:32.095 --> 01:35:34.222
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!

01:35:34.889 --> 01:35:36.599
Hey, check this out, man.

01:35:36.891 --> 01:35:39.727
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.

01:35:40.728 --> 01:35:43.523
Heard he's been beating everybody around Asia, too.

01:35:43.606 --> 01:35:45.441
Not tonight, Twinkie.

01:35:48.903 --> 01:35:50.571
Said he knew Han.

01:35:57.161 --> 01:35:58.913
Said Han was family.

01:36:12.927 --> 01:36:14.262
All right.

01:36:14.637 --> 01:36:15.763
Let's race.

01:36:42.999 --> 01:36:44.333
Nice ride.

01:36:44.792 --> 01:36:47.795
I won it from my friend Han, a few years ago.

01:36:49.881 --> 01:36:52.550
I didn't know he was into American muscle.

01:36:52.633 --> 01:36:55.136
He was when he was rolling with me.

01:36:57.763 --> 01:37:00.224
You know this ain't no 10-second race.

01:37:00.683 --> 01:37:02.602
I got nothing but time.

01:37:06.189 --> 01:37:07.732
You ready, kid?

01:37:18.618 --> 01:37:20.286
Come on, Sean! Come on!

01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:23.498
Ready!

01:37:26.584 --> 01:37:27.668
Set!

01:37:31.964 --> 01:37:33.007
Go!
