WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.875
Previously on Criminal Minds.

00:01.959 --> 00:04.375
This UnSub kills
in two- and three-day cycles,

00:04.458 --> 00:06.083
which means he's about
to go back out there.

00:06.166 --> 00:09.333
I got home from Iraq,
my baby sister, Lee, was missing.

00:09.333 --> 00:13.291
I found her on the streets.
I got her home, got her cleaned up.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.959
She even wore my dog tags
for good luck.

00:16.041 --> 00:18.792
Two weeks later,
she slipped back onto the streets,

00:18.875 --> 00:20.250
and has been missing ever since.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.792
We have another reported missing,
17-year-old Kelly Shane.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.583
Stop. No. No.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.291
No! No!

00:49.083 --> 00:51.417
Who the hell are you people?

00:52.959 --> 00:55.625
-You are Mason Turner?
-Dr Turner.

00:55.709 --> 00:59.500
This is my sister, Lee Hightower.
Has she been here?

00:59.583 --> 01:02.792
Can someone please tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:02.917 --> 01:03.959
We're with the FBI.

01:04.041 --> 01:07.625
We've been invited by the RCMP
to assist in an ongoing investigation.

01:07.709 --> 01:12.542
You haven't been invited into my home,
my Canadian home.

01:12.625 --> 01:15.291
Now get the hell out before I call
the proper authorities.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.458
Sir, we've been invited by

01:16.542 --> 01:19.375
-the proper authorities.
-Telephone, dial number 911.

01:20.083 --> 01:21.792
911, what is your emergency?

01:21.875 --> 01:25.792
This is Dr Mason Turner,
11712 Scott Road...

01:25.875 --> 01:27.417
That won't be necessary.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.166
I want these people out of my home.
They don't have any right to be here.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.834
Agent Rossi, Agent Hotchner,
may I have a word with you, please?

02:23.417 --> 02:24.667
Help me!

02:33.667 --> 02:34.917
Help me!

02:36.083 --> 02:39.166
-Did you hear that?
-What?

02:41.417 --> 02:43.083
Was that a scream?

02:47.208 --> 02:48.291
Anything?

02:48.375 --> 02:51.291
I don't even know
what direction it came from.

02:51.667 --> 02:55.041
That's another reason to hate these
damn woods. It messes with the sound.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.750
-You said this would be the UnSub.
-Everything points to him, Inspector.

02:58.834 --> 02:59.917
The profile was right.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.250
Does that man look capable
of abducting anyone?

03:02.333 --> 03:03.375
Relax, Jeff.

03:03.458 --> 03:06.166
I let a suspect who tried to kill
my border agents out of jail,

03:06.250 --> 03:09.375
a man who actually confessed
to the crimes we're investigating,

03:09.500 --> 03:11.875
because I believed you,
and you were wrong.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.792
It doesn't always make sense initially.

03:13.875 --> 03:18.083
No. I'm taking my prisoner back to
the station and you can all go home.

03:18.208 --> 03:19.542
Excuse me.

03:36.667 --> 03:37.875
Pretty.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.208
What's this thing?

03:46.625 --> 03:50.166
I don't know as much about pig farms
as you might think.

03:51.166 --> 03:55.500
Prentiss, that's a handprint.
It looks like blood.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.625
Oh, my God.

04:05.417 --> 04:09.333
Hotch, there's a box next to the pigs.
It's like a garbage bin or something.

04:09.417 --> 04:14.208
It's full of nothing but bloody shoes.
All different sizes, male and female.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.834
We said we were looking for
10 missings?

04:16.917 --> 04:20.291
There's got to be
over 100 pairs of shoes in that thing.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.834
These are...

04:33.625 --> 04:36.125
-They belong to victims?
-Possibly.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.959
Why just the shoes?
Where are the bodies?

04:39.041 --> 04:41.667
I don't think
there's going to be any bodies, guys.

04:41.750 --> 04:42.875
Pigs are omnivores.

04:42.959 --> 04:47.208
They'll eat anything.
By anything, I mean anything.

05:27.625 --> 05:31.083
-What happened?
-I'm going to take these cuffs off you.

05:32.417 --> 05:34.083
What's going on?

05:35.291 --> 05:38.834
-We're still not sure, William.
-Did you find my sister?

05:38.834 --> 05:40.834
No.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.500
But would you happen to know
what kind of shoes she was wearing

05:46.583 --> 05:49.625
-when she went missing?
-Shoes? No...

05:58.500 --> 06:00.417
-Is Bedwell all right?
-He will be.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.166
He has every available cop in Ontario
on the way here.

06:03.250 --> 06:06.083
-Did you find anyone in the house?
-Mason Turner.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.166
-Is he in custody?
-Not exactly.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.500
-But he's not going anywhere.
-He's quadriplegic.

06:11.583 --> 06:14.917
Paralysed from the neck down.
JJ's in there with him right now.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.834
-That's a pretty good criminal defence.
-I'll go talk to him.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.208
Morgan, do you have the contact
number for the Detroit detective?

06:22.291 --> 06:23.333
Benning, yeah.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.542
Yeah, we're going to need
their open missings

06:24.625 --> 06:27.041
so we can make identifications on
this property.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.375
Right.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.125
I think that laptop
is his sole communications device,

06:32.208 --> 06:35.417
which means data files
on hard drives. Records.

06:37.709 --> 06:39.208
BAU Tech Centre,

06:39.333 --> 06:41.792
where you should definitely pay
attention to the girl behind the curtain.

06:41.875 --> 06:44.125
Garcia, I need you in Ontario ASAP,

06:44.208 --> 06:47.417
at the farm house
that the UnSub's car was registered to.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.333
Yes, sir. What should I bring?

06:49.417 --> 06:51.291
We need forensic recovery
from a laptop.

06:51.417 --> 06:53.750
I'll tell you more when you get here.
I don't want this over the phone.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.917
-And the next flight, Garcia.
-Okay. On my way.

06:59.041 --> 07:01.875
Oh, my. Not over the phone.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.959
I don't think
we're going to be in Kansas any more.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.083
Reid, will you let Bedwell know
that we're going to need a warrant

07:09.166 --> 07:10.792
to examine the laptop
and the hard drives?

07:10.875 --> 07:13.417
Reid, how long do you think
it would take?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.542
-To get a warrant?
-No, for the pigs to...

07:16.625 --> 07:20.417
Depending on the size and condition of
the body when it's placed in the pen.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.792
It wouldn't be quick. Why?

07:23.208 --> 07:25.208
It means Kelly wasn't put in there.

07:25.709 --> 07:27.875
She's still here somewhere.

07:49.125 --> 07:52.959
Hey. My parents are going to be
looking for me.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.834
They're important people.

07:59.458 --> 08:00.959
Do you hear me?

08:04.917 --> 08:06.709
You better let me go.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.250
I'm serious!

08:21.333 --> 08:23.291
You're going to be in big trouble
if you don't.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.291
Are you listening to me?

08:26.375 --> 08:28.000
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.333
I'm sorry... Okay...

08:40.166 --> 08:42.125
They're going to need
some help outside.

08:42.208 --> 08:43.458
Yes, sir.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.667
Did something happen out there?

08:53.417 --> 08:55.000
You know what we found.

08:55.333 --> 08:58.834
How could I? You see I'm... Hey!

09:00.166 --> 09:01.667
Don't touch that.

09:03.250 --> 09:07.458
You know exactly what's out there.
You watched the whole thing.

09:07.542 --> 09:08.917
Put that back!

09:10.959 --> 09:15.125
-You like watching, don't you?
-This is not your jurisdiction.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.792
Well, I'm not going to arrest you.

09:18.291 --> 09:23.000
Stop that! Phone, dial number 9...

09:25.500 --> 09:29.041
-You can't do this to me.
-I'm not doing anything to you.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.792
In fact,
you don't even have to talk to me.

09:31.875 --> 09:38.041
As you said, I have no jurisdiction here.
But almost every policeman in Ontario

09:38.125 --> 09:42.583
is on their way to this farm
and they do have jurisdiction.

09:47.917 --> 09:51.166
Some very bad things
have happened here

09:51.667 --> 09:55.792
and they're going to discover all of it.
Now, Mason.

09:58.250 --> 10:03.917
How many victims were there?
A hundred? More?

10:05.333 --> 10:09.750
-Do you even know for sure?
-I need my mirrors.

10:09.875 --> 10:15.583
No. What you need is something
to make you look less like

10:15.667 --> 10:19.709
the monster that we both know
that you really are.

10:19.792 --> 10:23.667
How can you call me that?
I never laid a hand on anybody.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.333
You need to tell me where
the other guy is

10:26.417 --> 10:30.041
before he kills Kelly, your latest victim.

10:30.375 --> 10:34.083
So, how much time does she have,
Mason?

10:34.166 --> 10:40.125
How much time do you have before
I'm unable to say that you helped me?

10:44.792 --> 10:48.500
-No. No, no, no.
-I think I have a concussion.

10:50.709 --> 10:53.333
-I need a hospital.
-No hospitals!

10:53.417 --> 10:56.333
I won't tell them about you.
Just drop me off.

10:56.417 --> 11:00.458
-Hospitals are bad places.
-I really need to see a doctor.

11:00.542 --> 11:03.792
Mason says no hospitals!
Never no hospitals!

11:03.875 --> 11:07.000
Okay. Okay, no hospital.

11:10.542 --> 11:15.291
It was my brother, Lucas. He's crazy.

11:16.166 --> 11:20.375
He did all of it. He did this to me, too.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.792
I wanted to try to stop him.
How could I?

11:28.125 --> 11:33.125
-Why didn't you call for help?
-I tried that once, but he found out.

11:34.166 --> 11:36.792
He beat me. He almost killed me.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.709
You don't understand what it's like
to be completely vulnerable

11:41.709 --> 11:44.792
to someone who's capable of
the things that he's done.

11:46.625 --> 11:50.625
-Where is he right now?
-I wish I could help you.

11:50.875 --> 11:54.500
I don't know what he does
when he leaves me here.

11:54.834 --> 11:58.875
He has a girl with him,
a young girl from Detroit.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.667
Then you should pray for her.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.333
There's a picture of him in
the other room.

12:13.542 --> 12:18.250
It was taken years ago,
but it still looks like him.

12:20.291 --> 12:24.792
I should warn you, he's crazy
and very big.

12:25.583 --> 12:30.250
Inhumanly strong. When you find him,
you should warn everyone,

12:31.792 --> 12:35.500
if they don't kill him first,
he'll kill all of you.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.917
Got it. Good. Yep.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.417
Judge will sign the warrant for
the laptop first thing in the morning.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.000
Our tech should just be
getting here then.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.625
We've got
search and rescue units coming.

13:07.709 --> 13:10.125
They're also our
Emergency Response Team,

13:10.208 --> 13:12.125
so they'll be armed
in case we come across something.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.291
When this hits the press,

13:13.375 --> 13:15.250
families of missings are going to
come rushing out here.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.000
I'm going to need
some uniformed officers to assist me.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.792
Come on, let's get you set up.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.625
Morgan, I want you to supervise
the evidence collection.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.750
I don't think the techs have seen
a scene like this before.

13:23.834 --> 13:26.083
-Has anyone?
-We have a picture.

13:26.959 --> 13:30.625
This is Lucas Turner, Mason's brother.
According to Mason, he's the UnSub.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.250
Mason claims he's a victim himself.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.166
Does Mason know
where Lucas would take the girl?

13:35.250 --> 13:37.917
-Claims he has no idea.
-Reid, Lucas is your assignment.

13:38.041 --> 13:41.000
Find his room, his things, anything
that might tell us where he would go.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.458
-On it.
-One more thing.

13:42.542 --> 13:46.125
Mason warned me that his brother
is extremely psychotic.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.959
Says he won't go down without a fight.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.333
Prentiss, have JJ get the picture
and the description out to the press

13:50.417 --> 13:51.875
when they get here.
Put them to work for us.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.542
Somebody's going to notice
a man that big.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.792
-Yeah, got it.
-Dave.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.750
"According to Mason."
"Mason claims to."

13:59.834 --> 14:01.041
It sounds like you don't believe him.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.834
He also said we shouldn't even try to
talk to his brother.

14:03.917 --> 14:07.667
-We should shoot first.
-Well, that's either helpful advice...

14:07.667 --> 14:10.250
Or a way for half a team to clean up
loose ends.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.625
Either way, this is some family.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.000
If you have photos,
I can take them here.

14:25.083 --> 14:28.875
We have police officers that can ask
you questions about your loved ones.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.417
Andre, these are
the UnSub's coveralls.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.166
It looks like they haven't been washed
in some time,

14:34.250 --> 14:37.083
-so it should be a good scent source.
-Got it.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.583
Your warrant.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.667
You can search all his files
and hard drives.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.250
-Great.
-Let's go serve it.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.375
-Garcia, find me something.
-Yes, sir.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.250
Agent Morgan.

15:08.542 --> 15:11.250
-You got here fast.
-Detroit's not that far.

15:13.834 --> 15:17.625
-Did you bring the case files?
-I've got 35 open missings.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.417
-That's all?
-That's not enough?

15:21.917 --> 15:24.208
-Eighty-nine pairs.
-Eighty-nine...

15:24.291 --> 15:25.500
So far.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.583
God.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.458
I don't think God's been out here
in a long time.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.667
-How is he?
-How would you be?

15:39.875 --> 15:42.625
He asked for help
and nobody ever looked for his sister.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.125
We did the best we could.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.625
Ignoring him was
the best you could do?

15:45.709 --> 15:47.458
We were undermanned.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.875
And these are just all throwaway
people to you anyway, right?

15:51.959 --> 15:54.875
-That is not fair.
-Isn't it?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.667
Agent Morgan.
Can you come here, please?

16:00.083 --> 16:01.875
Grab your case files.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.709
Mason says his brother sometimes
sleeps on the couch in the living room

16:06.792 --> 16:09.583
or disappears for days at a time.

16:09.667 --> 16:12.083
-He doesn't have a room?
-Not according to Mason.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.750
Keep looking around.
They've lived here their whole lives.

16:14.834 --> 16:18.500
There's got to be something here
that gives us an idea of who he is.

16:21.041 --> 16:24.792
-That is my personal property!
-Not any more.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.375
-I showed you the warrant.
-I have research on there.

16:27.542 --> 16:30.875
Proprietary research!
Intellectual property!

16:31.500 --> 16:34.542
I helped you!
I told you everything I know!

16:34.625 --> 16:36.709
If what you told me
is your total involvement,

16:36.792 --> 16:40.834
there shouldn't be anything on this
computer that you don't want us to see.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.792
Do you need anything, Dave?

16:43.917 --> 16:48.250
No. Me and Mason are having
a great time, aren't we, Mason?

16:54.291 --> 16:58.834
Once I saw my brother strangle a man
so forcefully,

16:59.417 --> 17:01.792
blood dripped from his eye sockets.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.875
I'm not talking petechia.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.750
Actual dripping blood.

17:14.667 --> 17:20.166
He can be very volatile
when things don't go his way.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.625
Are you trying to scare me?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.458
I'm just saying you better hurry up
and find that girl

17:32.500 --> 17:35.083
or he's going to tear her to pieces.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.625
No, no, no.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.792
Is someone supposed to call you
on that phone?

17:45.250 --> 17:47.875
You don't have to hide it.
I'm trying to help.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.792
Maybe you don't get service in here.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.291
-Are we underground?
-What?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.458
The walls look like we're underground.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.208
If we are, your phone
probably won't work in here.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.125
-Won't work?
-Not if we're underground.

19:05.417 --> 19:08.208
-William.
-Have you found something?

19:31.875 --> 19:33.709
She asked me for them.

19:38.417 --> 19:41.667
Before I went back over there.
Before I lost my...

19:44.417 --> 19:46.417
William, I'm really sorry.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.417
She didn't want me to go back.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.375
Always said she knew
something was going to happen.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.291
I should have listened to her.

20:40.792 --> 20:44.166
Hotch, I got to get out of here.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.917
-What?
-I'm going to hook up with Prentiss

20:47.000 --> 20:49.709
on the search party.
I can't stand around here.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.834
Okay, keep in touch.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.500
If you're waiting for someone
to call you, they can't.

21:04.583 --> 21:07.875
-He always calls.
-But I'm telling you he can't.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
-He always calls!
-But if there's no service, he can't.

21:12.959 --> 21:14.500
-Reid?
-Up here.

21:14.583 --> 21:17.333
-Hey, I found out where he sleeps.
-So, Mason was lying?

21:17.417 --> 21:20.875
I find it hard to believe he didn't know
his brother was living in the barn.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.375
Anything up there
that's going to help us find him?

21:22.458 --> 21:24.083
No, nothing yet. I will say this, though.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.750
-I doubt that he's psychotic.
-Why is that?

21:26.750 --> 21:29.125
There's a collection of drawings
up here that suggest autism

21:29.208 --> 21:32.625
or moderate mental retardation.
Now retardation and psychosis

21:32.709 --> 21:35.208
in the exact same subject
is exceedingly rare.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.458
It's more likely
he doesn't fully understand

21:37.542 --> 21:38.750
the acts that he's committed.

21:38.834 --> 21:41.792
-Anything to suggest a violent nature?
-Nothing in the drawings.

21:41.875 --> 21:44.208
They do suggest
someone's been watching him.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.250
He's very childlike.
I think that when we find him,

21:47.333 --> 21:50.125
he's going to be scared
and probably confused.

21:50.208 --> 21:53.917
-You think he'll fight?
-Yeah. I don't know. Maybe.

21:56.375 --> 21:57.792
Hey, Hotch?

21:58.959 --> 22:02.834
Do you ever get the feeling that
a case isn't going to end well?

22:02.959 --> 22:05.750
Reid, keep looking. This girl needs us.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.625
Maybe you should go outside.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.166
What?

22:12.250 --> 22:14.917
You should walk around out there
until you get your call.

22:15.041 --> 22:17.542
-No!
-You really should go.

22:17.625 --> 22:20.875
He'll call me!
Don't you say he won't call me!

22:22.667 --> 22:25.333
-Don't you say he won't call me!
-Mommy! Mommy!

22:25.417 --> 22:28.667
Mommy, please! Help!

22:29.792 --> 22:31.291
Your mommy?

22:32.417 --> 22:36.125
I want to go home. I want to go home.
Mommy!

22:43.834 --> 22:45.834
You've been with this team,
what, two years, right?

22:45.917 --> 22:48.208
-Almost three already.
-It's been seven for me.

22:48.291 --> 22:50.834
I mean, that's all I've been thinking
about all day is, the entire time

22:50.917 --> 22:54.125
I've been with the BAU, working almost
non-stop, having no real life,

22:54.208 --> 22:55.875
these brothers have been out here
killing 89 people

22:55.959 --> 22:57.500
and we didn't even know about it.

22:57.583 --> 23:00.291
Well, we know now
and we'll make them pay.

23:00.375 --> 23:03.000
But how many others are still out there,
Prentiss?

23:03.083 --> 23:04.792
Hunting and killing.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.917
I mean, the thing is, no matter what
we do, no matter how hard we work,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.625
no matter how good we are
at what we do,

23:10.709 --> 23:12.125
this is never going to end.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.959
There could be some markings
up ahead there.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.375
At the tree line.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.709
He must have gone in the water.

23:24.834 --> 23:25.959
If the dogs lose that scent,

23:26.041 --> 23:28.125
it's going to be nothing
but a needle in a big, old haystack.

23:28.208 --> 23:30.125
Maybe we should split up,
take either side of the stream.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.375
He might have come back out
somewhere up there.

23:32.458 --> 23:36.083
As long as I don't have to hang out
at that damn pig farm, I'm good.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.959
Okay, defence system.
Let's see what you're made of.

23:41.291 --> 23:46.000
Bang. Like Berlin, another wall falls
and the world opens up.

23:46.375 --> 23:51.125
There you are, inner core.
Change password. Let's go with "Oz."

23:51.834 --> 23:55.375
Feeling so Dorothy Gale today.
Auntie Em would be so...

24:12.291 --> 24:14.834
-No!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.250
What?

24:18.709 --> 24:21.583
Mason says I always get mad too hard.

24:31.208 --> 24:34.125
What's your name? My name is Kelly.

24:34.917 --> 24:37.917
Mason says never. Never no names.

24:39.083 --> 24:41.625
Doesn't Mason want us to be friends?

24:43.417 --> 24:44.583
Friends?

24:51.291 --> 24:52.500
Garcia?

24:56.500 --> 25:00.542
-They were doing experiments.
-Experiments?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.834
-Unsuccessful ones.
-He tried to fix himself.

25:06.125 --> 25:08.750
Would it be better
if it was all for nothing?

25:08.875 --> 25:10.458
They were human beings.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.667
They were transients and drug users
and prostitutes.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.625
They were useless to society.

25:17.291 --> 25:22.250
I gave them the chance to be part of
a cure, to be of use.

25:23.291 --> 25:25.000
-That's...
-That's science.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.834
No, it isn't.

25:26.917 --> 25:30.625
Look, so you got some information
off my laptop. So what?

25:30.792 --> 25:34.625
What jury is going to believe I had
the power to kill anyone?

25:36.625 --> 25:40.458
I haven't been able to move from
the neck down for seven years.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.583
And even if you could convict me
of something,

25:47.625 --> 25:51.709
what punishment could be worse than
the life I already lead?

25:54.542 --> 25:56.291
Find my idiot brother,

25:58.291 --> 26:02.000
exact your pound of flesh
and leave me the hell alone.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.542
No.

26:10.166 --> 26:13.208
It's okay, you can tell me your name.

26:15.917 --> 26:19.667
-Lucas.
-That's a nice name,

26:20.583 --> 26:25.750
a very nice name.
Do you have any food, Lucas?

26:28.583 --> 26:30.917
-Food?
-I'm hungry.

26:31.875 --> 26:34.250
I threw up all my food when I was sick.

26:35.834 --> 26:37.792
I really need some food.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.250
Okay.

26:42.417 --> 26:46.375
No! Wait, I thought we were friends.

26:46.709 --> 26:49.083
You don't have to tie me up, Lucas.

26:52.041 --> 26:53.792
Mason says always.

26:53.875 --> 26:56.542
Mason doesn't want us to be friends,
remember?

26:57.709 --> 27:01.208
You don't have to tie me up, Lucas.
That's how friends act.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.917
I really need some food.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.333
Okay.

27:32.792 --> 27:35.834
-They were doing experiments.
-Spinal regeneration?

27:35.959 --> 27:38.625
Probably.
He was definitely trying to fix himself.

27:38.709 --> 27:41.208
Stem cell harvesting? The equipment's
far too unsophisticated.

27:41.291 --> 27:43.458
There's no way
it would have ever worked.

27:43.542 --> 27:46.583
You were a prosecutor, Hotch.
Could you convict this guy?

27:46.667 --> 27:50.500
A quadriplegic who clearly
never touched any of the victims?

27:50.959 --> 27:53.875
I don't know.
We need to concentrate on Kelly.

27:53.959 --> 27:56.625
We can't worry about
the other stuff right now.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.792
He might get away with this.

29:26.750 --> 29:30.417
Prentiss, I got someone sneaking
around about 30 yards ahead of me.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.375
Copy that.

29:57.959 --> 30:00.417
FBI! Do not move.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.083
Berries.

30:31.208 --> 30:34.583
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-I'm sorry, Mr Lang.

30:34.667 --> 30:40.333
-Can I go?
-Not yet, sir. Have you seen this man?

30:41.500 --> 30:43.792
-Now that's Lucas Turner.
-You know him?

30:43.875 --> 30:46.792
Everybody knows Lucas.
He's a little soft in the head.

30:46.875 --> 30:51.041
If you guys wait around long enough,
he'll wander back home. Can I go?

30:51.125 --> 30:52.834
Yes, sir. Thank you.

30:59.333 --> 31:03.250
-What do you think's in that bag?
-I'm pretty sure I don't want to know.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.166
These are delicious, Lucas.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.500
Could I have some water?

31:15.250 --> 31:18.041
-I have water.
-Could I have some?

31:26.333 --> 31:31.750
-This is a nice house you have, Lucas.
-This is not a house.

31:32.917 --> 31:36.375
-The farm is our house.
-What is this then?

31:37.166 --> 31:41.667
It's for where we do hunting.
Me and my dad and my brother built it.

31:42.625 --> 31:43.792
But then he died.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.667
-Your brother died?
-What?

31:45.750 --> 31:47.417
-You said...
-Mason didn't die!

31:47.542 --> 31:51.500
-He fell from the barn, but he didn't die!
-It's okay. I'm sorry, Lucas.

31:51.583 --> 31:55.542
-I take care of him.
-It's all right. I just made a mistake.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.500
I didn't... I didn't push him.

32:03.458 --> 32:06.709
I didn't push Mason off the barn.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.500
How did you get hurt?

32:11.792 --> 32:15.208
-What difference does it make?
-None, I guess.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.375
My brother pushed me out of the loft.

32:20.875 --> 32:25.917
I wanted to sell the farm.
I had just finished medical school.

32:27.375 --> 32:31.166
It would have given me a nice
down payment on a practice in the city.

32:31.500 --> 32:36.000
-But the farm was all he knew.
-Lucas doesn't handle angry well.

32:37.917 --> 32:41.417
-Is that why you hate him?
-Hate him?

32:41.709 --> 32:45.417
He's done nothing but take care of me
every day since then.

32:47.417 --> 32:52.333
You said not to even try talking to him
if we find him.

32:52.750 --> 32:55.291
That sounds like you want us
to kill him.

32:57.500 --> 33:02.083
That's not hate. That's a favour.

33:04.917 --> 33:08.750
My brother couldn't survive without me.

33:36.083 --> 33:39.792
Lucas?
Lucas, I have to go to the bathroom.

33:40.792 --> 33:43.542
I have to, you know, pee.

33:48.125 --> 33:51.291
-The bucket.
-No. I can't. Not in a bucket.

33:52.959 --> 33:54.375
There's a bucket.

33:54.375 --> 33:57.792
Lucas, that's okay for all of you boys,
but I'm a girl.

33:57.875 --> 33:59.250
I need privacy.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.291
-You have to let me go outside.
-But there's a bucket.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.875
-It's okay. We're friends.
-Friends?

34:11.500 --> 34:13.041
-Okay.
-Okay.

34:21.834 --> 34:23.834
-Anything else?
-Nothing that'll help find his brother.

34:23.917 --> 34:26.959
There's a cell phone he calls dozens of
times a day, but that appears to be off.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.000
And I tried to activate
the GPS locator on it,

34:29.083 --> 34:31.291
but I think it's an old phone,
so that's not going to work either.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.709
-Will you know if it comes on?
-I hope so.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.542
-Keep at it.
-Yes, sir.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.500
Okay. I can go from here.

34:52.834 --> 34:55.709
-Go?
-No, I'm not leaving, Lucas.

34:55.792 --> 34:59.041
I just need some privacy.

35:02.542 --> 35:05.542
You wait over there, Lucas,
by the door.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.166
It'll be all right.

35:14.041 --> 35:17.667
It's okay. It's okay.

35:23.709 --> 35:25.333
Further.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.959
Further.

35:33.250 --> 35:34.458
Further.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.959
-Hey, how's it going?
-Just waiting.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.000
Oh, my God.
The phone just turned back on.

35:59.792 --> 36:01.041
What? No!

36:13.208 --> 36:16.500
-Kelly.
-Almost done. Stay there, Lucas.

36:19.792 --> 36:20.834
Kelly!

36:21.125 --> 36:23.458
Oh, my God, Agent Rossi!
The phone is calling in!

36:27.166 --> 36:30.458
Hello? Hello? My name is Kelly!

36:31.083 --> 36:33.375
Kelly, this is Penelope Garcia.
I'm with the FBI.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.709
Oh, my God. You have to help me!

36:36.000 --> 36:40.834
I'm somewhere in the woods being held
by a man named Lucas and he...

36:42.166 --> 36:45.083
-Kelly?
-And he... Oh, my God!

36:45.166 --> 36:47.166
-Help me! Help me!
-That's mine!

36:49.291 --> 36:51.417
-The phone's disconnected.
-Garcia, can you find the signal?

36:51.500 --> 36:53.000
No. Wait. I'm...

36:53.083 --> 36:55.709
Yes, I'm hooked into the system.
I should be able to.

36:56.333 --> 36:58.667
Got it! It's just west of here.
Less than half a mile.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.792
-That's all you can tell?
-It's in the woods.

37:00.875 --> 37:03.125
-There aren't any reference points.
-Get the coordinates to my GPS

37:03.208 --> 37:05.458
and let Morgan and Prentiss know
in the field. Dave, Reid, let's go!

37:05.542 --> 37:06.834
Let me go!

37:09.000 --> 37:13.333
-The FBI is coming!
-Mason says everyone always lies!

37:13.417 --> 37:19.083
-Always. You lied! Always!
-Let me go, you freak!

37:25.959 --> 37:28.709
Almost there.
A couple of hundred yards.

37:42.375 --> 37:43.875
Should be right here.

37:48.542 --> 37:53.417
-I'm not a freak.
-Lucas. Lucas, I'm sorry.

38:02.125 --> 38:06.542
It should be right here.
This is where the signal came from.

38:07.208 --> 38:10.417
-There's nothing here.
-Kelly!

38:14.458 --> 38:17.875
-Kelly!
-I pushed him.

38:20.917 --> 38:22.875
-I pushed him.
-Lucas.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.542
I pushed him off the barn. It was me.
I did it.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.834
-I get too mad. I get bad mad.
-Lucas, you don't have to.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.667
Bad, bad mad.

38:35.083 --> 38:37.375
-Kelly!
-Kelly!

38:37.458 --> 38:38.917
-Kelly!
-Kelly!

38:39.792 --> 38:43.166
We're in exactly the right spot.
All right, everybody split up.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.291
Kelly!

38:45.792 --> 38:47.250
-Kelly!
-Kelly!

38:49.000 --> 38:50.417
-Kelly!
-Kelly!

38:52.250 --> 38:53.709
-Guys.
-Kelly!

38:57.333 --> 39:01.041
-I'm a freak.
-Lucas, you are not a freak.

39:01.667 --> 39:03.125
I'm a freak.

39:07.959 --> 39:09.125
Go ahead.

39:09.959 --> 39:12.375
-Kelly Shane?
-I'm down here!

39:13.500 --> 39:16.000
Don't make any sudden moves
when they come down, okay?

39:16.083 --> 39:18.458
I'm bad. I'm bad.

39:18.542 --> 39:22.041
-Lucas Turner, this is the FBI.
-Just put your hands up, okay?

40:55.959 --> 40:58.250
Sometimes there are no words,

40:58.333 --> 41:01.959
no clever quotes to neatly sum up
what's happened that day.

41:05.542 --> 41:09.875
Sometimes you do everything right,
everything exactly right,

41:10.959 --> 41:13.250
and still you feel like you've failed.

41:15.959 --> 41:17.792
Did it need to end that way?

41:18.667 --> 41:22.625
Could something have been done to
prevent the tragedy in the first place?

41:26.542 --> 41:29.000
Eighty-nine murders at the pig farm.

41:29.458 --> 41:33.291
The deaths of Mason and Lucas
Turner make 91 lives snuffed out.

41:36.667 --> 41:40.000
Kelly Shane will go home
and try to recover,

41:40.750 --> 41:44.375
to reconnect with her family,
but she'll never be a child again.

41:45.375 --> 41:48.125
William Hightower,
who gave his leg for his country,

41:48.208 --> 41:51.250
gave the rest of himself
to avenge his sister's murder.

41:53.083 --> 41:56.834
That makes 93 lives forever altered.

41:57.500 --> 42:01.583
Not counting family and friends
and a small town in Sarnia, Ontario,

42:02.000 --> 42:03.417
who thought monsters didn't exist

42:03.500 --> 42:06.625
until they learned
that they spent their lives with one.

42:07.667 --> 42:09.709
And what about my team?

42:10.875 --> 42:14.250
How many more times will they
be able to look into the abyss?

42:15.583 --> 42:17.667
How many more times
before they won't ever recover

42:17.792 --> 42:20.792
the pieces of themselves
that this job takes?

43:01.417 --> 43:05.542
Like I said,
sometimes there are no words,

43:06.083 --> 43:09.542
no clever quotes to neatly sum up
what's happened that day.

43:10.709 --> 43:12.250
You should have made a deal.

43:12.333 --> 43:16.083
Sometimes the day just

43:19.166 --> 43:20.333
ends.
