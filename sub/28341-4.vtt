WEBVTT

00:04.133 --> 00:06.413
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

00:06.438 --> 00:10.660
Our brief was to embed an officer
in an organised crime group.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.440
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

00:13.465 --> 00:15.675
His files were erased
from the police database,

00:15.676 --> 00:19.406
his phone number and e-mail deleted.
Corbett was given a new identity.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.284
It's the Eastfield depot.

00:23.309 --> 00:26.586
It's where all the police forces in
the region store seized contraband,

00:26.587 --> 00:29.119
drugs, cash, jewels, precious metals.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.160
This could be bigger
than the Brink's-Mat.

00:32.348 --> 00:35.068
There's a strong suggestion women
in that block are being kept

00:35.069 --> 00:38.188
in modern-day slavery to
provide sexual services.

00:38.189 --> 00:40.228
Our duty is to protect them.

00:40.229 --> 00:45.308
And we will raid the house
and raid the print shop.

00:45.309 --> 00:46.500
Do it.

00:47.189 --> 00:49.029
Christ, how old is she?

00:51.509 --> 00:54.949
Who is it, Lise?
Who am I giving all this info to?

00:56.109 --> 00:57.540
H?

00:58.109 --> 01:00.748
There's a girl on the unit.
Name's Lisa McQueen.

01:00.749 --> 01:02.508
And she's also the one that makes contact

01:02.509 --> 01:04.013
with the higher levels
of the organisation.

01:04.013 --> 01:06.388
- How?
- Laptop.

01:06.389 --> 01:08.388
We talk via an audio link.

01:08.389 --> 01:10.908
The replies come up as text.

01:10.909 --> 01:12.988
As far as the risk goes,

01:12.989 --> 01:16.740
we can minimise that by using
your assets, bent coppers.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.309
The CHIS who's been giving me intel
on the OCG...

01:23.629 --> 01:24.789
It's Corbett.

01:25.869 --> 01:28.068
He's relayed intelligence
on a planned armed robbery

01:28.069 --> 01:29.268
of the Eastfield depot.

01:29.269 --> 01:33.700
Eastfield? What's he got backing him
up there, a Panzer division?

01:35.349 --> 01:38.388
Detective Chief Superintendent
Hargreaves was pronounced dead

01:38.389 --> 01:39.700
a short while ago.

01:41.509 --> 01:44.268
First duty, preservation of life.

01:44.269 --> 01:47.668
Divert the AFOs to respond
to the Status Zero.

01:47.669 --> 01:49.028
Hastings?

01:49.029 --> 01:51.548
He pulled you out of there
so we could get away with the gear.

01:51.549 --> 01:53.588
He's the one calling all the shots.
He's H.

01:53.589 --> 01:57.109
John Corbett, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Lester Hargreaves.

01:59.909 --> 02:01.835
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.801
- Yeah. I know.
- How much?

02:03.826 --> 02:05.668
Hundred grand.

02:05.669 --> 02:07.948
I don't want the fiasco of
Operation Pear Tree,

02:07.949 --> 02:09.868
which was not of your making,

02:09.869 --> 02:13.828
add a disastrous coda to
an otherwise distinguished career.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.589
It's only temporary, obviously.

02:22.349 --> 02:25.262
I'm sorry to bother you at such
a late hour, Mrs Hastings.

02:25.263 --> 02:29.220
I'm Detective Sergeant
Steve Arnott, AC-12.

02:36.669 --> 02:37.709
Sir.

02:45.389 --> 02:49.268
The doctors say she'll be fine, sir.
She'll make a good recovery.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.109
Thank you, I just need to see my wife.

02:54.709 --> 02:58.180
Between us, Mrs Hastings didn't
want your gaffer involved.

02:58.869 --> 03:00.429
That's why it came to us.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.349 --> 03:14.108
All right, love.

03:14.109 --> 03:15.149
Ted.

03:19.269 --> 03:20.789
Jesus Christ.

03:25.029 --> 03:26.220
Are you in any pain?

03:27.429 --> 03:28.740
Not any more.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.349
They've doped me up to the eyeballs.

03:34.349 --> 03:35.709
How did it happen?

03:36.829 --> 03:39.860
A man called at the house
saying he was from AC-12,

03:40.749 --> 03:43.940
so of course I told him
I'd better ask you first.

03:45.109 --> 03:47.020
Before I could make the phone call,

03:48.029 --> 03:51.789
a man broke in wearing
a balaclava over his face.

03:54.029 --> 03:56.020
You think there were two men?

03:56.749 --> 03:59.460
The man at the door gave
the name Steve Arnott.

04:01.269 --> 04:03.508
But you've met Steve Arnott.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.828
I've been through all this
with the other detective...

04:05.829 --> 04:08.268
I know, darling, I know, but...

04:08.269 --> 04:10.509
The man that broke in,
I never saw his face...

04:12.749 --> 04:14.149
...and he was from back home.

04:17.629 --> 04:18.749
What do you mean?

04:19.869 --> 04:21.029
They haven't told you?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.069
He spoke with a Belfast accent.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.620
He said you'd know why he done it.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.468
He said you'd know what you've cost him.

04:31.469 --> 04:33.988
No, no, no, no. No.

04:33.989 --> 04:35.828
No, these people, they're just thugs.

04:35.829 --> 04:37.667
You don't believe a word that
comes out of their mouth.

04:37.692 --> 04:39.868
They're just trying to
get to me with all this,

04:39.869 --> 04:44.028
and trying to stop my team
from beating a path to their door.

04:44.029 --> 04:45.828
Who?

04:45.829 --> 04:48.068
There's any number of ongoing
inquiries, of course.

04:48.069 --> 04:49.828
But you know I'm not
allowed to disclose...

04:49.829 --> 04:51.628
You and your precious regulations.

04:51.629 --> 04:56.788
He's only been to my home, only
tortured me and put me in hospital.

04:56.789 --> 04:59.108
I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry.

04:59.109 --> 05:02.508
If I'd have been there, I'd have
been able to protect you, you see.

05:02.509 --> 05:05.589
So now you're trying to make out
it was my fault?

05:07.589 --> 05:09.388
- No, no, no...
- If we'd still been together,

05:09.389 --> 05:11.271
- this wouldn't have happened?
- Course not!

05:11.296 --> 05:12.740
Is that your game, Ted?

05:13.589 --> 05:15.308
No.

05:15.309 --> 05:16.500
Get out.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.028
She's in a terrible state.
A terrible state.

05:26.029 --> 05:28.908
Look, anything you need for your
investigation, you just ask.

05:28.909 --> 05:31.748
- You understand? Just ask.
- Thank you, sir.

05:31.749 --> 05:34.348
Given the victim is your wife, sir,
I'm sure you appreciate why

05:34.349 --> 05:36.708
Serious Crime needs to
handle this independently.

05:36.709 --> 05:39.228
Yeah, well, it's just as well
I'm out of it.

05:39.229 --> 05:41.548
Because I can tell you whoever
is responsible for this,

05:41.549 --> 05:44.148
he'd better pray
he's up in front of a judge

05:44.149 --> 05:46.100
before I get my hands on him.

05:46.509 --> 05:47.988
Sorry, sir.

05:47.989 --> 05:51.468
For my report, any significance
you know of regarding

05:51.469 --> 05:55.860
the pattern of injuries to your
wife's wrists, knees and ankles?

05:56.509 --> 05:57.749
No.

06:05.029 --> 06:06.149
Cheers, Sam.

06:07.549 --> 06:09.588
Any new leads on Hargreaves?

06:09.589 --> 06:11.308
We're working on it.

06:11.309 --> 06:13.228
I'm learning the hard way
how people react

06:13.229 --> 06:15.588
when they find out
you've had a bent boss,

06:15.589 --> 06:17.469
the insinuation you must have known.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.069
Ma'am.

06:21.862 --> 06:23.542
Call me, yeah?

06:43.029 --> 06:44.868
Sam told us Mrs Hastings claimed

06:44.869 --> 06:46.788
her attacker had a Northern Irish accent.

06:46.789 --> 06:49.828
And we all know her injuries are classic
paramilitary punishment wounds.

06:49.829 --> 06:52.708
Look, the gaffer's had
the shock of his life.

06:52.709 --> 06:55.060
Your family,
that's a whole another level.

06:55.629 --> 06:57.988
Let's hope the gaffer opens up,

06:57.989 --> 06:59.949
before we have to start asking.

07:06.829 --> 07:09.069
This is Lisa, on with Clayton.

07:15.909 --> 07:17.389
About that, yeah.

07:21.629 --> 07:23.349
I have my moments.

07:29.509 --> 07:30.857
We've just hit a few bumps

07:30.882 --> 07:32.978
trying to fence the
Eastfield gear, that's all.

07:33.003 --> 07:35.308
Yeah, but nothing we
can't get over in time.

07:35.309 --> 07:38.188
But maybe it'd help speed things
along by fencing the gear

07:38.189 --> 07:39.460
via other units.

07:44.749 --> 07:46.908
We just need a bit of a leg-up,
that's all, you know.

07:46.909 --> 07:49.549
That way, we all get to reap the rewards.

07:57.949 --> 07:59.189
Shit.

08:01.069 --> 08:03.068
This job, it was meant to make us.

08:03.069 --> 08:04.908
- Call him back.
- That's not how this works.

08:04.909 --> 08:06.548
Well, you tell me, then, how it works!

08:06.549 --> 08:08.363
What, is he some kind of mind-reader
or what?

08:08.364 --> 08:10.948
No. I talk to someone who talks
to someone who talks to someone.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.108
Tell me who,
and I'll get the message through.

08:13.109 --> 08:14.652
It's time me and this prick had words.

08:14.677 --> 08:16.228
That's what I'm worried about, mate.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.388
- Why are you protecting him?
- Protecting him?

08:18.389 --> 08:20.788
Jesus, John, it ain't that way round.

08:20.789 --> 08:23.108
No? Hargreaves crossed us.

08:23.109 --> 08:25.548
So who's he going to have
crossed us to? Hey?

08:25.549 --> 08:27.388
Now we've got one load of coppers
on our tail

08:27.389 --> 08:30.548
and another load on a payroll.
Someone's orchestrating all that.

08:30.549 --> 08:33.388
So who do you think's
the best man for the job? Hey?

08:33.389 --> 08:36.260
This prick's a copper.
I can feel it in me water.

08:37.989 --> 08:41.748
You're talking shite, John.
You can't know if he's a copper.

08:41.749 --> 08:44.388
I've met enough in my time, more
than enough, more than you, Lise.

08:44.389 --> 08:46.948
Look, H is a senior police officer.

08:46.949 --> 08:48.429
Tell me I'm wrong.

08:53.829 --> 08:55.668
What's happening?

08:55.669 --> 08:58.188
We're rounding up officers
identified by semen deposits

08:58.189 --> 09:01.348
that were being kept in cold storage
at the Borogrove Estate brothel.

09:01.349 --> 09:05.348
Some have already confessed to being
blackmailed into assisting the OCG.

09:05.349 --> 09:07.748
One of the semen deposits matched
Hargreaves' DNA.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.260
It was recent as well.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.788
Suggesting the blackmail was also recent?

09:11.789 --> 09:13.428
It's looking that way, boss.

09:13.429 --> 09:16.308
I've re-interviewed all the officers
known to have assisted the OCG,

09:16.309 --> 09:18.188
Jane Cafferty, Kieran Bloom and so on.

09:18.189 --> 09:20.388
None of them claim to have
had contact with Hargreaves

09:20.389 --> 09:21.948
before a few months ago.

09:21.949 --> 09:24.228
There's no way he could have been H.

09:24.229 --> 09:26.708
H goes back much further.

09:26.709 --> 09:28.348
Sorry, ma'am, is this a bad time?

09:28.349 --> 09:30.308
- No, it's fine. Thanks, Tatleen.
- Ma'am, Sarge,

09:30.309 --> 09:32.708
we've had a breakthrough
at Kingsgate Printing Services.

09:32.709 --> 09:34.460
The search of the premises
yielded some findings

09:34.485 --> 09:36.028
we've passed on to Cyber Crime.

09:36.029 --> 09:37.640
- Amanda Yao.
- Kate Fleming.

09:37.665 --> 09:38.788
DS Arnott.

09:38.789 --> 09:41.628
Corbett relayed intel on a laptop
being used to communicate

09:41.629 --> 09:43.468
with the higher levels of the OCG.

09:43.469 --> 09:45.988
Most likely, the laptop accessed
mobile data services

09:45.989 --> 09:47.828
via an encrypted dongle.

09:47.829 --> 09:51.588
Unfortunately, that means
we can't access the conversions.

09:51.589 --> 09:54.388
Inquiries to service providers
covering that location led to

09:54.389 --> 09:57.548
a mobile data account registered
at Kingsgate Printing Services.

09:57.549 --> 09:59.868
We've analysed the account
using various tools

09:59.869 --> 10:02.068
and been able to access the metadata.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.188
And tracing the communication
between the device

10:04.189 --> 10:07.308
at Kingsgate Printing Services
reveals another user with

10:07.309 --> 10:09.548
internet protocol address
located in Spain.

10:09.549 --> 10:12.188
That doesn't necessarily mean
the user's in Spain.

10:12.189 --> 10:14.788
Correct. The user could have
concealed their true location,

10:14.789 --> 10:16.708
connecting via multiple VPNs.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.708
They may be in Spain.
They may be next door.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.308
There's no way of knowing.

10:20.309 --> 10:22.268
Have you harvested enough
information for us to

10:22.269 --> 10:24.388
impersonate the unknown user online?

10:24.389 --> 10:27.388
Yes, given time,
we can simulate all the metadata.

10:27.389 --> 10:29.948
We'd also need to formulate
some characteristic statements

10:29.949 --> 10:33.868
in advance so users on the other end
don't think it's an impersonation.

10:33.869 --> 10:35.708
This would all take a few days.

10:35.709 --> 10:37.349
- Do it.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:38.949 --> 10:43.708
How is she doing, Ted?
Anything I can do, anything.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.228
Thank you, ma'am.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.548
We sent some flowers.

10:46.549 --> 10:48.788
Hospitals don't allow flowers any more.

10:48.789 --> 10:50.189
Infection control.

10:51.749 --> 10:52.828
Oh.

10:52.829 --> 10:56.468
Still, it's a very generous thought,
ma'am. We're very grateful.

10:56.469 --> 10:59.620
Poor woman, at her age.

11:02.509 --> 11:06.228
I hate to turn the conversation
back to operational concerns

11:06.229 --> 11:09.308
- at a time like this...
- Not at all, ma'am. Not at all.

11:09.309 --> 11:11.428
50 million quid's worth of seized goods

11:11.429 --> 11:13.108
stolen from a police facility

11:13.109 --> 11:15.988
that was supposed to be
under AC-12 surveillance.

11:15.989 --> 11:18.868
Yes. But we did succeed in
apprehending the senior officer

11:18.869 --> 11:21.580
who was in cahoots with
the organised crime group,

11:22.109 --> 11:25.188
the head of Serious Crime, no less.
And we will round up

11:25.189 --> 11:28.708
his accomplices, Corbett included,
believe you me.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.188
There's now a personal dimension
to your inquiry,

11:31.189 --> 11:33.268
following the assault on your wife.

11:33.269 --> 11:36.868
Indeed, ma'am, but Serious Crime
are handling that investigation.

11:36.869 --> 11:38.380
I am taking no part.

11:38.829 --> 11:41.268
The reason they did it, ma'am,
was to pull me away from

11:41.269 --> 11:42.508
the bigger inquiry.

11:42.509 --> 11:45.868
I would ask you not to give them
the satisfaction.

11:45.869 --> 11:47.788
But it's only natural
people will question

11:47.789 --> 11:49.309
how it affects your judgment.

11:50.989 --> 11:54.868
I can vouch for Superintendent
Hastings' personal integrity.

11:54.869 --> 11:59.660

26:12.069 --> 26:14.068
[HE LAUGHS]

26:14.069 --> 26:15.229
See...

26:16.669 --> 26:19.308
I knew you was the brains.

26:19.309 --> 26:21.940
Yeah, let's talk.

26:31.709 --> 26:34.748
So, how many girls?

26:34.749 --> 26:36.149
- Six to ten.
- Right.

26:38.389 --> 26:39.828
What happened?

26:39.829 --> 26:42.229
The Eastfield job. That's what happened.

26:44.149 --> 26:45.669
Get in, lads. Give us a minute.

26:49.669 --> 26:51.868
I get it, OK? I screwed up.

26:51.869 --> 26:54.428
The Eastfield goods are too hot.

26:54.429 --> 26:58.388
But the brothel got raided, so maybe
we should avoid the livestock trade.

26:58.389 --> 27:02.588
Look, I'm not a fan either.
As I said, business is business.

27:02.589 --> 27:04.748
Like it or not, this is what we do.

27:04.749 --> 27:05.900
Do you?

27:07.149 --> 27:08.189
Do I what?

27:09.349 --> 27:10.389
Like it.

27:13.149 --> 27:17.148
Don't ask yourself that.
It don't lead anywhere helpful.

27:17.149 --> 27:19.300
I'm in, that's all.

27:20.149 --> 27:21.380
No matter what?

27:23.749 --> 27:25.269
I just do what's expected.

27:30.389 --> 27:32.788
Them two shagging or what?

27:32.789 --> 27:34.940
- How should I know?
- Mm.

27:37.029 --> 27:38.788
No. What matters is the Eastfield job.

27:38.789 --> 27:40.698
We've got to pull together
to make it pay off.

27:40.699 --> 27:42.708
- "We"?
- You've got to go right to the top.

27:42.709 --> 27:44.303
Only the top man can get enough coppers

27:44.328 --> 27:46.660
looking the other way so
we can move the goods on.

27:47.629 --> 27:49.189
I've already set up a meet.

27:50.549 --> 27:53.229
Nice one, Lise. That's just what we need.

27:57.349 --> 27:59.589
[PHONE RINGS]

28:03.789 --> 28:04.840
John?

28:04.865 --> 28:07.468
Yeah, it's me, Steph.
I'm OK, love, I'm safe.

28:07.469 --> 28:09.828
Thank God. I've been worried sick.

28:09.829 --> 28:12.250
John, they was here again,
them two from anti-corruption.

28:12.275 --> 28:13.376
Eh?

28:15.629 --> 28:18.508
I wanted to call you straight after,
but I knew I shouldn't.

28:18.509 --> 28:21.628
That's all right.
You did the right thing.

28:21.629 --> 28:23.548
What did they want?

28:23.549 --> 28:24.940
It's scary, John.

28:25.589 --> 28:28.100
They was asking about
Northern Ireland and that.

28:28.589 --> 28:31.028
They was even asking about
family over there.

28:31.029 --> 28:34.748
Did they know anything?
Anything of my mum or anything?

28:34.749 --> 28:37.428
- No, nothing.
- So what did you say?

28:37.429 --> 28:39.868
You know I'd never say nothing.

28:39.869 --> 28:41.900
It's all right. I know you wouldn't.

28:46.629 --> 28:48.180
What's this all about?

28:49.380 --> 28:51.708
Do they know about Anne-Marie?

28:51.709 --> 28:54.189
No. You know I can't talk about the job.

28:55.829 --> 28:57.189
John, what's wrong?

29:00.829 --> 29:02.315
John?

29:02.340 --> 29:04.548
I'm... I'm just missing you...

29:04.549 --> 29:07.509
I'm just missing you
and the girls loads, that's all.

29:09.389 --> 29:11.309
We're missing you loads an' all.

29:11.900 --> 29:15.189
I can't wait for this job to be done
and I can come home.

29:31.989 --> 29:34.108
- Sir.
- Sir.

29:34.109 --> 29:35.460
Right.

29:36.349 --> 29:39.348
So, what have we got?

29:39.349 --> 29:41.748
We've had a breakthrough,
thanks to our Cyber Crime team.

29:41.749 --> 29:43.948
Corbett's been communicating
with the command level

29:43.949 --> 29:45.988
of the organised crime group
via a computer link.

29:45.989 --> 29:48.188
- Great. Have we traced the link?
- Not conclusively, sir,

29:48.189 --> 29:50.468
but we're aiming to be in a position
to simulate it.

29:50.469 --> 29:52.788
That'll enable us to exploit
Corbett's desire to fence

29:52.789 --> 29:54.448
the seized goods by luring him
to a meeting.

29:54.449 --> 29:56.121
- Good.
- We've got targeted surveillance

29:56.146 --> 29:58.868
in place at Corbett's
family home on Merseyside.

29:58.869 --> 30:01.508
Last night, an incoming call
was made by a burner phone that

30:01.509 --> 30:04.468
we've triangulated to premises
in the Edge Park area,

30:04.469 --> 30:05.828
a development of apartments,

30:05.829 --> 30:07.988
one of which may be Corbett's
covert residence.

30:07.989 --> 30:10.500
Great. We've got his location.
We've got him.

30:11.429 --> 30:14.668
Sir, Corbett's crossed a line,
nobody's arguing he hasn't,

30:14.669 --> 30:18.148
but he's also our best chance of
apprehending other corrupt officers.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.508
Corbett's convinced he's in contact
with the top man.

30:20.509 --> 30:21.908
Yeah, well, that's as may be, son,

30:21.909 --> 30:24.188
but we cannot have him out there
for another day longer.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.188
What if he commits another crime?

30:26.189 --> 30:28.748
What if, God forbid,
he takes another life?

30:28.749 --> 30:32.948
Sir, there is a threat-to-life risk
if Corbett won't come quietly.

30:32.949 --> 30:34.500
Well, that's his lookout.

30:37.229 --> 30:38.308
Thank you.

30:38.309 --> 30:39.429
- Sir.
- Sir.

31:13.109 --> 31:16.708
I'll do everything I can to make him
give himself up peacefully.

31:16.709 --> 31:19.868
No, no, son. You hang on to that.

31:19.869 --> 31:21.680
We're not going to take any chances here.

31:21.705 --> 31:22.813
Sir.

31:24.949 --> 31:26.389
It won't come to that.

31:36.109 --> 31:40.422
Sierra Zulu 2-5. Contact.
Standing by for confirmation of ID.

31:40.452 --> 31:45.420
Received, 2-5.
TFC, visual. Confirming target ID.

31:51.269 --> 31:55.620
Heading west on Harnest Street.
TFC, do you copy, 6-4?

31:56.589 --> 31:58.220
6-4, standing by.

32:04.309 --> 32:07.948
TFC, 4-5 clear to approach.

32:07.949 --> 32:09.749
4-5, received.

32:26.109 --> 32:27.189
John.

32:28.709 --> 32:29.940
Well...

32:30.469 --> 32:32.908
Guess I underestimated
your powers of detection.

32:32.909 --> 32:36.628
You know why I'm here, mate. Let's
bring an end to this whole thing.

32:36.629 --> 32:39.108
- Listen to me, John...
- No, you listen to me.

32:39.109 --> 32:42.780
It's on for today. The top man,
I'm meeting him.

32:43.229 --> 32:46.988
Look, this is it, Steve. The bent
copper pulling all the strings,

32:46.989 --> 32:48.388
you know, and not just the top man.

32:48.389 --> 32:50.748
Lisa McQueen, she's going to turn.
I'm sure of it.

32:50.749 --> 32:54.708
And she's got contacts going back
years, the whole organisation.

32:54.709 --> 32:57.940
You nick me now and we'll never
get this chance again.

32:58.829 --> 33:02.188
4-5, this is 1-0. Apprehend the subject.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.340
Right now!

33:05.229 --> 33:06.988
Where's the meeting taking place?

33:06.989 --> 33:08.908
No. No way. I know your game.

33:08.909 --> 33:10.988
I give you that,
and this gets taken out my hands.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.028
And you know why I can't let that happen.

33:13.029 --> 33:15.108
This corrupt network
goes right to the top.

33:15.109 --> 33:17.388
And today, I'll prove how close to home.

33:17.389 --> 33:19.388
Come and work with us, not against us.

33:19.389 --> 33:21.228
Is that the best you can come up with?

33:21.229 --> 33:22.708
I assaulted your gaffer's wife.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.340
He'll make sure I go down.
There's no two ways about it.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.109
Mother of God.

33:28.709 --> 33:31.668
Let's work together, John.
We want the same thing.

33:31.669 --> 33:33.668
I believe you, mate. I honestly do.

33:33.669 --> 33:36.548
But only one of us is prepared
to go the distance on this job.

33:36.549 --> 33:39.588
You've got blind loyalty, which stops
you seeing what's plain as day,

33:39.589 --> 33:41.748
the person this trail leads to.

33:41.749 --> 33:45.948
1-0. 4-5, apprehend the subject at once.

33:45.949 --> 33:48.748
Sir, is it not worth letting
this play out another 24 hours?

33:48.749 --> 33:51.708
Look, Kate, we do not trust
Corbett one inch.

33:51.709 --> 33:54.668
He's already battered a defenceless
woman in her own home.

33:54.669 --> 33:56.628
For Chrissake, Kate!
What are you waiting for?

33:56.629 --> 33:58.708
Sir. TFC.

33:58.709 --> 34:00.949
4-5, arrest the subject.

34:02.869 --> 34:04.868
DS Arnott, you're in receipt
of a lawful order

34:04.869 --> 34:08.148
from a commanding officer.
You will carry it out at once.

34:08.149 --> 34:11.308
John, I need you to accompany me
to AC-12...

34:11.309 --> 34:14.668
You need you to back off
and let me finish this job!

34:16.909 --> 34:19.739
DS John Corbett, you're under arrest.

34:20.429 --> 34:23.748
Snipers, maintain cover.
6-4, prepare to move forward.

34:23.748 --> 34:25.507
Yeah. Sure I am.

34:25.509 --> 34:27.108
John.

34:27.109 --> 34:28.349
John!

34:31.869 --> 34:35.748
7-5, target blocked,
no visual on subject.

34:35.748 --> 34:38.148
4-5, 1-0. Active message.

34:38.149 --> 34:39.389
Critical shot blocked.

34:40.469 --> 34:41.860
Put the gun down.

34:42.349 --> 34:44.659
John, put the gun down.

34:46.349 --> 34:50.300
1-0 to 4-5. The order is Fahrenheit.

34:50.869 --> 34:52.708
Sir, we'll lose all of Corbett's intel.

34:52.708 --> 34:56.268
Lethal force is authorised where
there's an immediate threat to life.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.180
We know that Corbett is
a cold-blooded killer.

34:59.949 --> 35:01.748
The order is Fahrenheit.

35:01.749 --> 35:03.108
Give yourself up.

35:03.109 --> 35:05.868
Repeat, the order is Fahrenheit.

35:05.869 --> 35:07.340
Give yourself up!

35:09.189 --> 35:12.460
You shoot me and the truth
never comes out.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.108
What kind of copper are you, eh?

35:18.109 --> 35:21.069
One who cares about orders,
or one who cares about justice?

35:29.029 --> 35:30.340
You wearing a wire?

35:31.189 --> 35:32.429
Yeah.

35:32.740 --> 35:34.300
Take it out.

35:34.869 --> 35:37.020
And I'll tell you the where and when
for this meeting.

35:37.629 --> 35:40.100
Steve, do not comply. That's an order.

35:45.749 --> 35:48.349
- [FEEDBACK CRACKLES]
- What the hell is he playing at?

35:53.869 --> 35:56.948
- Shit!
- The wee gobshite.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.884
Get the AFOs down there on the double!

35:58.885 --> 36:01.189
Sir. 6-4, move in urgently.

36:05.189 --> 36:07.148
The Palisades, the shopping centre.

36:07.149 --> 36:08.988
This afternoon, four o'clock.

36:08.989 --> 36:10.628
Be careful who you tell.

36:10.629 --> 36:13.469
Because if it doesn't happen,
you know you've got a leak.

36:17.989 --> 36:19.260
Thanks, mate.

36:21.309 --> 36:24.868
OFFICER: 6-4, not yet visual
with target. ETA ten seconds.

36:24.869 --> 36:26.309
TFC, received.

36:30.029 --> 36:31.269
Where is he?

36:37.149 --> 36:38.749
- Anyone see him?
- Shit.

36:40.909 --> 36:42.148
Where'd he go?

36:42.149 --> 36:44.548
A thorough search of the location
detected a service door

36:44.549 --> 36:46.948
in the passageway where the target
was last observed.

36:46.949 --> 36:50.268
The service corridor leads
to an underground car park.

36:50.269 --> 36:55.148
CCTV captured the subject making his
escape via the underground car park.

36:55.149 --> 36:57.828
There's a locked service door
which opens out onto the far side

36:57.829 --> 37:01.108
of the apartment block,
which we didn't have covered.

37:01.109 --> 37:03.948
By the time my team got round
the back, he was long gone.

37:03.949 --> 37:06.641
I'm very sorry, sir. OK. Thank you, Kyle.

37:06.666 --> 37:07.920
Sir.

37:14.789 --> 37:17.628
As a UCO, he will have identified
all the escape routes

37:17.629 --> 37:19.388
at his residence.

37:19.389 --> 37:21.508
The service door was locked.

37:21.509 --> 37:24.842
Probably he found a means
of acquiring the key codes.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.108
Yeah.

37:26.109 --> 37:27.428
On the plus side, sir,

37:27.429 --> 37:30.348
we have been able to identify
Corbett's apartment.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.709
Search team and forensics
have been deployed.

37:36.229 --> 37:37.269
Good.

37:40.869 --> 37:43.468
I think I've let him stew
long enough, don't you?

37:43.469 --> 37:48.388
Sir, I'd appreciate your guidance
on my report for the SFC.

37:48.389 --> 37:52.500
- Your Fahrenheit order was irregular.
- Now listen...

37:52.909 --> 37:56.468
The SFC authorised the use of firearms

37:56.469 --> 37:58.068
for this morning's operation.

37:58.069 --> 38:02.428
The suspect was a known armed
criminal with a history of violence

38:02.429 --> 38:05.388
who was an immediate and credible
threat to the public.

38:05.389 --> 38:10.588
Therefore, lethal force is justified
according to Common Law Section 3

38:10.589 --> 38:13.268
of the Criminal Law Act of 1967

38:13.269 --> 38:18.548
and Section 117 of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act of 1984.

38:18.549 --> 38:22.120
Now, are we're done dotting the
I's and crossing the t's here?

38:22.145 --> 38:23.258
Sir.

38:24.549 --> 38:28.034
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I am fine, Kate. I'm fine.

38:28.035 --> 38:31.028
It's just now Corbett's confessed
to assaulting your wife...

38:31.029 --> 38:34.508
Look, the guy is responsible
for killing five police officers,

38:34.509 --> 38:35.868
Maneet Bindra being one of them.

38:35.869 --> 38:39.349
This is the monster we're dealing
with. For Chrissake, Kate!

38:56.709 --> 38:57.749
Remain standing.

39:03.429 --> 39:05.445
Sir, can we do this
somewhere more private?

39:05.470 --> 39:07.268
Absolutely not.

39:07.269 --> 39:08.629
I'll hear your report.

39:12.189 --> 39:14.480
My operational assessment was
that Corbett had acquired

39:14.505 --> 39:17.828
high-value intelligence which
overrode the necessity for arrest.

39:17.829 --> 39:20.868
My order was clear and lawful.

39:20.869 --> 39:22.740
I'm not an assassin.

39:23.269 --> 39:25.548
If loss of life can be avoided,
it should be avoided.

39:25.549 --> 39:29.508
And with respect, sir, I'd dispute
the lawfulness of your order.

39:29.509 --> 39:31.588
You'd just learned Corbett
had been responsible

39:31.589 --> 39:32.988
for a vicious attack on your wife.

39:32.989 --> 39:37.789
What was the intelligence
that Corbett divulged?

39:41.709 --> 39:44.788
Was that intelligence relating
to the senior police officer

39:44.789 --> 39:47.620
complicit with the OCG? Am I right?

39:48.149 --> 39:54.149

- Yes.
- So what was the intelligence?

40:02.740 --> 40:05.068
Corbett advised me
to limit my disclosure,

40:05.069 --> 40:06.740
as he fears there may be a leak.

40:09.869 --> 40:13.068
Well, I am looking round this room,
son, and I can only see me and you,

40:13.069 --> 40:16.540

is going to come from!

40:35.229 --> 40:39.028
A meeting at 4pm today
between the OCG and the top man.

40:39.029 --> 40:40.389

We can't risk it.

42:36.709 --> 42:39.428

45:16.389 --> 45:18.548
Forensics were able to detect
DNA and fingerprints

45:18.549 --> 45:19.829
at Corbett's apartment.

Great.

Boss...

45:24.789 --> 45:26.269
We've got Corbett's prints.

45:32.549 --> 45:35.188
As you've both deduced, like
everyone else joining the police,

45:35.189 --> 45:37.028
Corbett had to provide elimination prints

45:37.029 --> 45:39.388
to exclude crime scene contamination.

45:39.389 --> 45:41.668
These haven't been erased from
the IDENT1 system,

45:41.669 --> 45:44.108
which gives us access to
identity records he submitted

45:44.109 --> 45:47.788
when he first joined the force in 1999.

45:47.789 --> 45:50.188
John Corbett is the name he was
given when he was adopted

45:50.189 --> 45:54.468
by the Corbett family in 1989
at the age of ten.

45:54.469 --> 45:57.188
His adoptive mother's
maiden name was McGillis.

45:57.189 --> 45:58.708
I believe she was a close relative,

45:58.709 --> 46:01.228
as Corbett's birth name
was John McGillis.

46:01.229 --> 46:02.589
He was born in Belfast.

46:03.709 --> 46:08.068
His father was Anthony Patrick
McGillis, deceased 1984.

46:08.069 --> 46:11.860
And his mother, Anne-Marie
McGillis, deceased 1989.

46:12.389 --> 46:15.348
Hence Corbett's move to Liverpool
and the adoption.

46:15.349 --> 46:16.389

on the McGillis family,

47:36.549 --> 47:38.229
It's him. It's Corbett.

that the meeting was arranged?

to the right person.
