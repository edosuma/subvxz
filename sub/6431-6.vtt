00:03.356 --> 00:06.395
Hello there.
Agent Sally Stukowski. FBI.

00:06.396 --> 00:07.764
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

00:07.830 --> 00:08.898
We're trying to help.

00:08.966 --> 00:11.000
Well,
we specialize in "weird."

00:11.061 --> 00:14.353
We can help you.
We--we know stuff.

00:14.420 --> 00:15.453
I'm Claudia.

00:15.521 --> 00:17.249
Douglas.
Douglas Fargo.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.485
Everyone just calls me Fargo.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.216
Okay. Doug.

00:21.283 --> 00:24.356
I spent some time in
a psychic...Research facility.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.567
And I just told you
I was in an institution,

00:26.634 --> 00:28.805
so I guess today's
sharing day.

What the warehouse needs
are interns.

00:49.472 --> 00:50.405
Is that the whole order?

00:50.473 --> 00:51.740
Yeah, party fuel

00:51.808 --> 00:53.575
for a super-fun night
of inventory reports.

00:53.642 --> 00:55.810
You know, Claude,
I think sometime

00:55.878 --> 00:57.611
you ought to bring
your guilt-box down here

00:57.679 --> 00:58.779
and rock out the locals.

01:01.783 --> 01:02.816
No.

01:02.883 --> 01:03.917
- No?
- No.

01:03.984 --> 01:05.619
Come on.
You're really good.

01:05.687 --> 01:06.921
You got to get out
of your comfort zone.

01:06.989 --> 01:08.890
You play at the B&B
all the time.

01:08.958 --> 01:10.893
Where no one can hear me.

01:10.961 --> 01:12.597
Especially you.
Quit eavesdropping on me.

01:12.665 --> 01:14.399
What's wrong with you?

01:14.467 --> 01:16.169
Here. Hold this.
What's wrong with you?

01:16.237 --> 01:17.504
Artie,
unblock your number.

01:17.572 --> 01:20.006
Yes, I made sure
they used the vanilla sprinkles

01:20.074 --> 01:21.508
as well as the soy whip.

01:21.576 --> 01:23.377
Soy whip? No, no, no,
I don't need soy whip.

01:23.445 --> 01:25.514
I need to speak
with someone named Claudia.

01:25.581 --> 01:27.215
- Who is this?
- This is Gibson.

01:27.283 --> 01:28.616
And he told me
to call this number

01:28.684 --> 01:30.351
in case something went wrong
with the beta test,

01:30.419 --> 01:32.153
and something has gone wrong,
really, really wrong,

01:32.221 --> 01:33.721
and I'm the only one
that's not vegging.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.422
Hey, hey, hey, Gibson,
de-spaz for a second.

01:35.490 --> 01:36.824
Who told you to call me?

01:36.892 --> 01:40.928
Fargo.
And I think he's gonna die.

This is the address

02:09.197 --> 02:11.100
Ugh.
It reminds me of college.

02:11.167 --> 02:12.601
Hey, Gibson?

02:12.669 --> 02:14.870
Back here!

02:14.938 --> 02:16.038
Oh,
thank God you guys came.

02:16.106 --> 02:17.674
They're, like,
freaking out right now.

02:17.741 --> 02:19.275
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know what to do.

02:19.343 --> 02:21.311
Oh, my God, Fargo.

02:21.379 --> 02:22.580
Oh, no,
don't touch the headband!

02:24.616 --> 02:26.917
What do you think
was the first thing I tried?

02:26.985 --> 02:28.552
Is this his heart rate?

02:28.620 --> 02:29.820
How long
has it been that high?

02:29.888 --> 02:31.855
Few minutes.
It goes up and down.

02:31.923 --> 02:33.790
All right, uh,
Gibson, is it?

02:33.858 --> 02:35.359
Who are you,
why are we here,

02:35.426 --> 02:37.694
and why is Fargo
jacked into the matrix?

02:37.762 --> 02:39.029
They're playing
a video game,

02:39.096 --> 02:41.298
and I don't know
how to get them to stop.

02:41.365 --> 02:43.567
Oh.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:43.634 --> 02:44.935
In here.

02:52.278 --> 02:56.747
This way...Fargo
can tell you himself.

02:56.815 --> 02:58.716
Greetings,
potential investors.

02:58.784 --> 03:00.051
<i>Ni hao.</i>

03:00.118 --> 03:01.252
My name
is Dr. Douglas Fargo,

03:01.320 --> 03:03.187
world renowned scientist,

03:03.255 --> 03:05.723
inventor...Dreamer.

03:05.791 --> 03:08.526
I'm here today
to talk to you

03:08.594 --> 03:10.729
about an exciting
new business venture,

03:10.797 --> 03:12.198
one that will
change the standard

03:12.266 --> 03:15.101
of video game entertainment
for all humankind.

03:15.169 --> 03:18.504
Welcome to Fargames.

03:18.572 --> 03:21.207
Six months ago,
two M.I.T. graduates,

03:21.275 --> 03:22.642
Jerry Hoffler
and Gibson Ryce

03:22.709 --> 03:24.811
came to me with an idea.

03:24.878 --> 03:26.346
They called it the braid--

03:30.685 --> 03:31.886
braid.

03:31.953 --> 03:34.089
The braid creates
artificial feelings--

03:34.157 --> 03:36.625
sights, sounds, smells.

03:36.693 --> 03:38.994
A full sensory experience.

03:39.062 --> 03:42.132
You don't just play the game,
you live it.

03:42.199 --> 03:45.068
Fargames--
imagining greater.

03:45.136 --> 03:49.073
So, uh, Fargo and Jerry
were beta testing this game?

03:49.140 --> 03:51.108
Yeah.
Things were going great,

03:51.176 --> 03:52.310
but after a few hours,
their...

03:52.377 --> 03:54.279
Pulses started to spike.

03:54.346 --> 03:55.747
Look, Gibson,

03:55.814 --> 03:57.849
I.T. problems really aren't
our area of expertise.

03:57.917 --> 03:59.717
Isn't there someone
at Eureka that could--

03:59.785 --> 04:03.354
The braid never worked,
did it?

04:04.423 --> 04:05.624
The human brain

04:05.691 --> 04:07.459
wouldn't accept the lie
of artificial reality.

04:07.527 --> 04:10.396
But Fargo thought he found
something that would help.

04:15.069 --> 04:17.603
They drank out of it
before they started the test.

04:22.944 --> 04:25.011
Damn.

04:25.079 --> 04:26.946
That little geek
found an artifact.

04:37.156 --> 04:39.024
Agent Jinks.

04:39.091 --> 04:41.359
Thanks so much for coming
on such short notice.

04:41.427 --> 04:42.794
Agent Stukowski.

04:42.862 --> 04:44.663
Considering you tried
to have me arrested

04:44.730 --> 04:46.131
the first time we met,

04:46.199 --> 04:48.167
I was a little surprised
to get an S.O.S. call from you.

04:48.234 --> 04:49.435
Oh, no,
that thing in Denver,

04:49.503 --> 04:50.870
honey,
water under the bridge.

04:50.938 --> 04:53.240
Reason I called is I've got
a real humdinger here,

04:53.307 --> 04:56.643
and since your organization
specializes in "weird,"

04:56.711 --> 04:58.980
I thought I'd take a chance.

04:59.047 --> 05:00.615
So you came alone?

05:00.683 --> 05:02.617
Not...quite.

05:02.685 --> 05:04.553
How'd that little nerd
get his hands on an artifact?

05:04.621 --> 05:05.688
I'll kill him!

05:05.755 --> 05:07.523
I'll call Leena
and she can help.

05:07.590 --> 05:08.991
Eureka.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.659
Oh, did you just
figure something out?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.694
What?
Uh, no. Who's this?

05:12.762 --> 05:15.230
FBI Agent Sally Stukowski,
this is Artie--

05:15.298 --> 05:16.665
Agent Nielsen.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.100
Pleasure, yes.

05:18.168 --> 05:20.236
Thanks again for taking time
out of your schedule.

05:20.303 --> 05:22.371
Y'all must be busy
with whatever it is you do.

05:22.439 --> 05:24.039
You want to just
walk us through the scene?

05:24.107 --> 05:25.541
Yes.
Eric Johnson, 47,

05:25.609 --> 05:27.510
curator of the Hobbes Gallery,

05:27.578 --> 05:30.114
takes a dive
out of this window here.

05:30.181 --> 05:33.584
Official ruling is suicide,
but I don't think so.

05:33.652 --> 05:35.387
Coworkers and family
say that he was excited

05:35.454 --> 05:37.122
about the exhibit
opening next week.

05:37.190 --> 05:39.992
No signs of depression
of erratic behavior.

05:40.060 --> 05:41.661
Hmm.

05:41.728 --> 05:45.732
And...And, uh,
were there any witnesses?

05:45.799 --> 05:47.400
Uh, no,
he was working late.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.402
Report says he was
the only one in the building.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.304
I'm sort of missing
the weirdness here.

05:51.372 --> 05:54.141
Coroner's report.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.242
That's Mr. Johnson?

05:56.310 --> 05:57.610
He only fell two stories,

05:57.678 --> 05:59.111
but the impact trauma,

05:59.179 --> 06:00.913
it's like he was skydiving
without a parachute.

06:00.981 --> 06:03.081
That is weird.
And disgusting.

06:03.149 --> 06:08.419
So thoughts, ideas,
suggestions, hypotheses?

06:08.487 --> 06:11.555
I got nothing.

06:11.623 --> 06:14.091
Coroner's right.

06:14.159 --> 06:15.159
Suicide.

06:15.226 --> 06:16.527
Oh, beg your pardon.

06:16.594 --> 06:17.794
No, that's safety glass.

06:17.862 --> 06:19.329
He couldn't have
just jumped through it.

06:19.397 --> 06:20.463
Oh, he took a running jump

06:20.531 --> 06:21.998
from all the way
across the room,

06:22.066 --> 06:24.000
built up enough force, and
went right through the glass.

06:24.068 --> 06:26.203
What?
Saw it on <i>Mythbusters.</i>

06:26.270 --> 06:27.604
So that's it, then?

06:27.672 --> 06:29.507
'Fraid so.
Good luck. Steve?

06:30.676 --> 06:32.076
Oh.
Oh, you know what?

06:32.144 --> 06:33.545
This is the manager
of the building.

06:33.613 --> 06:35.647
Man thinks I work for him.
I'll show you out in a second.

06:35.715 --> 06:37.249
We'll show ourselves out.
Thanks.

06:37.317 --> 06:38.284
Perfect.

06:38.351 --> 06:39.485
I could tell
you were lying.

06:39.553 --> 06:40.653
Yeah,
that never gets old.

06:40.721 --> 06:41.888
Take a look
at that oil painting.

06:41.956 --> 06:43.423
It's right across
from the broken window.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.424
It is a van Gogh.
<i>Stormy Night.</i>

06:44.491 --> 06:45.458
Been missing for years.

06:45.525 --> 06:46.859
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:46.927 --> 06:50.563
It's bounced around Europe
since World War I,

06:50.630 --> 06:53.366
and death has followed
that painting

06:53.434 --> 06:54.968
wherever it's been spotted.

06:55.036 --> 06:56.870
If it's an artifact,
why don't we just take it?

06:56.938 --> 06:58.104
And tell them what?

06:58.172 --> 06:59.806
"Your priceless painting
murdered a man,

06:59.874 --> 07:00.907
please can we have it"?

07:00.975 --> 07:02.042
Oh,
Stukowski called us in.

07:02.110 --> 07:03.443
Yeah,
and I have no intention

07:03.511 --> 07:05.145
of giving her any more clues
as to what it is we do.

07:05.213 --> 07:06.346
No, no, no, no.

07:06.414 --> 07:07.981
If we're gonna
get that painting...

07:11.185 --> 07:12.586
We're gonna
have to steal it.

07:21.330 --> 07:24.499
Does it look
anything like this?

07:24.566 --> 07:27.801
It's an exact match.

07:27.869 --> 07:30.338
No effect
on Fargo or Jerry.

07:30.405 --> 07:32.139
The warehouse
has the fourth cup.

07:32.207 --> 07:33.674
All right,
so what's the story?

07:33.742 --> 07:36.109
Well, the tea set
belonged to Beatrix Potter,

07:36.177 --> 07:38.379
19th century English writer.

07:38.446 --> 07:39.847
<i>Peter Rabbit.</i>
I love that book.

07:39.915 --> 07:42.716
Yeah, the league of evil
British writers strikes again.

07:42.784 --> 07:44.151
The rest of the set

07:44.219 --> 07:45.619
has been on Artie's
most wanted list for years.

07:45.687 --> 07:47.454
Hey,
"Used for brewing teas

07:47.522 --> 07:48.989
"derived from rare fungi

07:49.056 --> 07:52.391
"cultivated by Potter
during her time as a mycologist.

07:52.459 --> 07:53.492
"The tea is known
to stimulate

07:53.560 --> 07:55.528
the precuneus region
of the brain."

07:55.596 --> 07:57.163
It's the imagination center.

07:57.230 --> 07:59.765
I bet that's why Potter got
into writing children's stories.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.468
So, what? The tea set
made her trip bunnies?

08:02.536 --> 08:04.970
Fargo must have figured it'd
help do what the brain couldn't.

08:05.038 --> 08:06.739
You know, make the brain
experience total reality

08:06.807 --> 08:08.007
inside the game.

08:08.075 --> 08:09.408
I've seen Potter's
first editions

08:09.476 --> 08:10.476
in the warehouse library.

08:10.544 --> 08:11.844
Leena,
can you send us the scans?

08:11.912 --> 08:13.246
- You got it.
- Claudia!

08:17.285 --> 08:18.852
Uh, he just
started doing this.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.587
We got to get him
out of there.

08:20.655 --> 08:22.022
I've been reading
the schematics,

08:22.090 --> 08:23.657
and I don't think
there's anything we can do...

08:23.725 --> 08:25.960
From out here.

08:33.635 --> 08:35.503
So if you could never
get 'em to work,

08:35.571 --> 08:37.005
why'd you make so many?

08:37.072 --> 08:38.739
Yeah, well, Fargo's
not the most linear thinker.

08:38.807 --> 08:40.909
Hey,
I upgraded the hardware.

08:40.976 --> 08:42.977
You should be able to
incorporate that into the game.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.445
- You did this in 20 minutes?
- Quicker than Domino's.

08:44.513 --> 08:46.047
Myka, that's an
in-game communicator,

08:46.115 --> 08:47.048
so you'll be able
to talk to us

08:47.116 --> 08:48.282
once we go inside.

08:48.350 --> 08:49.684
Claudia and I'll go in,
find them,

08:49.751 --> 08:50.951
and boogie on
back out to reality.

08:51.019 --> 08:52.119
Game on,
urban warrior.

08:52.187 --> 08:53.754
Yup.

09:01.162 --> 09:03.930
Okay. You both need avatars
to play in the game.

09:03.998 --> 09:04.964
What do you want to be?

09:05.032 --> 09:06.465
Make me a badass.

09:06.533 --> 09:07.567
What kind of game
is this anyway?

09:07.634 --> 09:08.968
I just did the hardware.

09:09.036 --> 09:12.538
It's some sword and sorcery
thing that Fargo wrote.

09:12.605 --> 09:13.606
Think he's a wizard?

09:13.673 --> 09:15.140
I was gonna be
a warlock priest.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.142
I'll just be myself.

09:17.209 --> 09:19.110
Okay.

09:19.178 --> 09:21.246
Are you sure it won't work
without the tea?

09:21.313 --> 09:22.680
We tried.
If you don't drink,

09:22.748 --> 09:24.181
the game's just a game.

09:24.249 --> 09:26.650
Fargo wanted
more than that.

09:28.220 --> 09:30.220
Yeah,
looks like he got it.

09:30.288 --> 09:33.323
Well, I'll be here to make
sure that nothing goes wrong.

09:33.391 --> 09:37.094
Or...More wrong.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.995
Oh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

09:39.063 --> 09:40.597
No, no, no.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.699
I was playing <i>Frogger</i>
when you were just a tadpole.

09:42.766 --> 09:47.404
Just to make sure
the pop out works, right?

09:47.472 --> 09:51.308
Mm. Oh, man.
That--that's minty.

09:51.376 --> 09:55.445
I hope there's no caffeine
in there, 'cause--

09:55.513 --> 09:58.883
Well, his--his pulse
is still normal.

09:58.950 --> 10:01.986
Uh, dude?
Dude? You there?

10:02.053 --> 10:04.621
Yeah, yeah.
Hello?

10:04.689 --> 10:06.757
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

10:06.825 --> 10:09.526
Oh, wow.
It's awesome in here.

10:09.594 --> 10:11.562
Is that the--?
Oh, man.

10:11.629 --> 10:13.897
Dude, uh,
look down at your belt.

10:13.965 --> 10:15.132
You see the controller?

10:15.199 --> 10:17.100
The white thing
with the button on top?

10:17.168 --> 10:21.204
Right.
Push the button.

10:21.272 --> 10:25.376
Ooh,
you guys got to see this.

10:25.443 --> 10:28.011
Fill 'er up.

10:36.254 --> 10:39.924
Is it me, or does that
look a little bit like...?

10:39.991 --> 10:43.761
Yep, Fargo made
a Warehouse 13 video game.

10:49.467 --> 10:51.501
And somewhere in there,
Fargo's having a seizure.

11:02.872 --> 11:06.141
Whoa.
And you're a stripper.

11:06.209 --> 11:08.843
What?
No, I'm--I'm a gladiator.

11:08.911 --> 11:09.911
It's cool, right?

11:09.979 --> 11:11.379
Yeah.
Nice skirt.

11:11.447 --> 11:13.181
Nice ears.

11:13.249 --> 11:15.249
Huh?

11:15.317 --> 11:17.651
Poi--pointy?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.419
I'm an elf?
I said "myself."

11:19.487 --> 11:21.788
Well,
you need to enunciate.

11:21.856 --> 11:25.392
Now run to your tree
and get me some cookies.

11:25.459 --> 11:26.893
Halt, players!

11:30.899 --> 11:32.299
Artie?

11:32.367 --> 11:35.470
I am General Arthur
of the Queen's Royal Best.

11:35.537 --> 11:38.507
Now, players, prepare
for a life-ending quest

11:38.575 --> 11:41.210
through bleak, barren lands.

11:41.277 --> 11:43.479
You will stumble and blunder,

11:43.546 --> 11:48.483
trying to find a world
of bizarre, endless wonder.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.193
Whoa.
You see this?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.362
Yeah.
Don't really believe it, though.

12:05.499 --> 12:08.869
Welcome, players,
to Fortress 13,

12:08.937 --> 12:12.306
the most wondrous place
that's never been seen,

12:12.374 --> 12:14.309
hidden deep in the valley

12:14.376 --> 12:16.044
of the Land of Bad.

12:16.112 --> 12:18.247
Filled with dangerous relics.

12:18.314 --> 12:22.918
Some evil, some...
Mad.

12:22.986 --> 12:26.088
Artie's gonna be deeply pissed.

12:26.156 --> 12:30.858
The princess is imprisoned
high in the Black Tower,

12:30.926 --> 12:34.629
her life slipping away
with each passing hour.

12:34.696 --> 12:36.430
True heroes you are

12:36.498 --> 12:38.965
to take this brave test.

12:39.033 --> 12:43.803
Now, will you accept
your dangerous quest?

12:43.871 --> 12:46.906
Your generalness,
I am Pete-imus Maximus

12:46.974 --> 12:48.675
of the Lattimer Legion.

12:48.742 --> 12:51.878
This is my faithful squire...
Claudi-elf.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.979
We would love
to save your princess,

12:54.047 --> 12:55.615
but are looking
for two royal geeks.

12:55.682 --> 13:00.354
True heroes you are
to take this grave test.

13:00.421 --> 13:04.625
Now will you accept
your dangerous quest?

13:04.692 --> 13:08.228
Short, glasses, unnatural
attraction to computers?

13:08.296 --> 13:10.964
Now, will you accept
your dangerous--

13:11.032 --> 13:12.232
Pete,
it's just a program.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.934
Fargo and Jerry must be
further on in the game.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.168
We're just gonna
have to play along

13:15.236 --> 13:16.369
if we're gonna find 'em.

13:16.437 --> 13:17.871
Now, will you accept
your dangerous...

13:17.939 --> 13:20.340
Sure, sure, why not?

13:20.407 --> 13:22.575
Welcome, players,
to Fortress--

13:22.643 --> 13:25.278
- Both: Yes!
- Ah.

13:25.345 --> 13:29.850
Follow the path to the cave
of forbidden mystery.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.720
There you must collect
the Black Tower key,

13:32.787 --> 13:34.855
and with it
free the princess,

13:34.923 --> 13:37.325
and so save the day.

13:37.392 --> 13:39.961
Great rewards await those

13:40.029 --> 13:42.831
who act the right way.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.006
Cave of forbidden
mystery, huh?

13:50.073 --> 13:51.707
Sounds cheery.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.312
Myka-mus.

13:56.379 --> 13:57.847
Pete,
how's it going in there?

13:57.914 --> 13:59.782
Well, so far, so good.

13:59.850 --> 14:01.717
No sign of
the Parker Brothers yet,

14:01.785 --> 14:04.453
but we're on a quest,
and I have a really cool sword.

14:04.521 --> 14:05.988
Oh, oh.
What did I get?

14:06.056 --> 14:08.925
I got a...
Vial of purple goo. Great.

14:08.992 --> 14:10.393
I wanted nunchucks.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.929
Okay, look, you have
to find Fargo and Jerry.

14:12.996 --> 14:14.230
I don't know
how much longer

14:14.298 --> 14:15.498
their hearts
can beat at this rate.

14:15.566 --> 14:18.167
Copy that.
Crash Bandicoot out.

14:18.235 --> 14:22.905
Okay. Let's go find
the scarecrow, shall we?

14:22.973 --> 14:24.307
Come, Toto.

14:27.445 --> 14:33.216
♪ ♪

14:35.853 --> 14:37.354
Artie! Hey!

14:37.421 --> 14:38.655
Will you listen to me?

14:38.722 --> 14:39.856
I've been up and down
this place.

14:39.924 --> 14:41.091
I know security systems.

14:41.158 --> 14:42.458
And this one
is far too sophisticated,

14:42.526 --> 14:43.893
and probably--

14:44.995 --> 14:46.396
Wasting my time?

14:46.463 --> 14:50.066
I know.
I never get tired of that.

14:50.134 --> 14:53.469
Ah, ah.

14:53.537 --> 14:55.171
Oh, I'm sorry.
My burglary skills are rusty.

14:55.238 --> 14:56.605
We're warehouse agents.

14:56.673 --> 14:58.641
This isn't burglary.
This is creative snagging.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.042
Well, I'll be getting
my own lawyer.

15:00.110 --> 15:01.210
Wha--whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:01.277 --> 15:02.611
What is that?
Some sort of weapon?

15:02.679 --> 15:05.113
You know, you just add more time
to the sentence, right?

15:06.216 --> 15:09.119
Three, two, one.

15:10.188 --> 15:11.922
It's called an eclipse.

15:11.990 --> 15:14.325
Deactivates
all laser protection

15:14.393 --> 15:15.727
for 42 minutes
and 59 seconds.

15:15.794 --> 15:17.562
Why 42 minutes
and 59 seconds?

15:17.630 --> 15:18.930
That's how long
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> is.

15:18.998 --> 15:20.065
You're a Floyd fan?

15:20.133 --> 15:21.534
Dude,
have you seen laser Floyd?

15:21.601 --> 15:23.603
Dude, I've got Roger Waters'
name tattooed on my neck.

15:23.670 --> 15:25.305
No, I'm not a Floyd fan.

15:25.373 --> 15:27.006
Thought you two
might be back.

15:27.074 --> 15:29.576
Guess I was right about
all that weirdness after all.

15:29.643 --> 15:30.977
Uh, Agent Stukowski,
this isn't...

15:31.045 --> 15:32.513
Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.

15:32.580 --> 15:36.350
Agent Nielsen,
either you include me,

15:36.417 --> 15:39.386
or I activate the alarm.

15:39.454 --> 15:43.825
Your choice.

15:52.068 --> 15:54.204
This is not
the <i>Peter Rabbit</i> I remember.

16:09.053 --> 16:10.553
Oh, man.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.955
There's some serious copyright
infringement going on here.

16:13.023 --> 16:14.190
Wait.

16:14.257 --> 16:16.858
We passed Seabiscuit here
20 minutes ago.

16:16.926 --> 16:18.693
Oh, nertz.
We've been going in circles.

16:18.761 --> 16:20.362
Classic video game trope.

16:20.429 --> 16:21.596
We should have
seen this coming.

16:27.370 --> 16:28.604
Hey, are you all right?

16:28.672 --> 16:30.539
Wait, Claudia,
we don't know what it is.

16:30.607 --> 16:31.874
Well,
it's obviously trapped.

16:31.942 --> 16:33.209
And didn't
General Arthur say

16:33.276 --> 16:35.411
that great rewards await those
who act the right way?

16:35.479 --> 16:37.113
And helping this
whatever that is could be--

16:37.180 --> 16:39.983
Acting the right way.
Fair enough.

16:40.051 --> 16:41.351
Stand back.

16:41.419 --> 16:44.121
I'll use my trusty sword.

16:47.859 --> 16:49.193
Ah!

16:49.260 --> 16:50.460
Ah, yow!

16:50.528 --> 16:52.462
There's that
full-sensory experience

16:52.530 --> 16:53.797
Fargo was talking about.

16:53.865 --> 16:54.898
Silly gladiator.

16:54.966 --> 16:56.499
Disco ball's an artifact.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.701
And artifacts
need to be neutralized, right?

17:17.521 --> 17:18.654
Thank you, player.

17:18.722 --> 17:20.723
Leena.

17:23.127 --> 17:25.762
Look, wings.

17:25.829 --> 17:27.896
Yes, wings.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.799
You freed me
from Carter's curse,

17:29.867 --> 17:32.635
and in return, I will show you
the way to your destination.

17:35.872 --> 17:38.573
Great.
More yellow road.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.408
For you, young elf,

17:40.476 --> 17:43.744
a special reward for using
your wits to solve my plight,

17:43.812 --> 17:45.980
instead of thuggish force.

17:46.047 --> 17:50.284
Thuggish
can be good sometimes.

17:52.787 --> 17:53.720
High score.

17:53.788 --> 17:55.055
That is a boon.

17:55.123 --> 17:56.856
Should you find yourself
in need,

17:56.924 --> 17:58.858
you may call on Leena
of the eagle people.

18:04.565 --> 18:06.433
How does she get off
the ground with those things?

18:06.500 --> 18:07.968
They're wings.

18:08.035 --> 18:12.506
Yeah,
the wings probably help.

18:12.574 --> 18:14.875
Hey, wait up.

18:38.733 --> 18:40.934
Oh, no, he didn't.

18:41.002 --> 18:44.170
He actually copied
the dark vault.

18:44.238 --> 18:46.073
So not cool.
Fargo!

18:46.140 --> 18:48.508
Get out here right now!

18:48.576 --> 18:50.611
Hey, hey.
Key.

18:50.679 --> 18:51.979
The key.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.582
"There you must collect
the Black Tower key.

18:54.650 --> 18:56.585
"With it, free the princess,

18:56.653 --> 18:59.688
and so save the day."

18:59.756 --> 19:02.825
Claudia, wait!

19:02.893 --> 19:06.128
Quicksand?

19:06.196 --> 19:07.829
This must be the deathy
part of the game

19:07.897 --> 19:10.866
General Artie talked about.

19:10.933 --> 19:15.670
Hey,
there's someone in there.

19:19.507 --> 19:21.708
Oh. Oh.

19:21.776 --> 19:23.509
Come on. That's it.

19:27.748 --> 19:30.817
Come on! Come on.

19:30.884 --> 19:32.452
Dougie.

19:42.897 --> 19:44.965
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

19:45.033 --> 19:46.833
Okay, okay, okay.
Hugs later.

19:46.901 --> 19:48.501
Both of you
still have your controllers.

19:48.569 --> 19:49.936
Hey, hey, hey,
easy there, grabby.

19:50.004 --> 19:51.604
We have to find Jerry.
Where is he?

19:51.672 --> 19:54.173
Yeah, and what happened
to your controller?

19:54.240 --> 19:55.307
He happened.

20:00.779 --> 20:03.948
Holy crap.
Who invited the Grim Reaper?

20:07.353 --> 20:08.987
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.

20:09.055 --> 20:11.124
Look, I am a gladiator,

20:11.191 --> 20:13.894
and I demand that you--

20:13.961 --> 20:18.499
okay...

20:18.567 --> 20:20.968
You know,
sometimes in a video game,

20:21.036 --> 20:24.105
I think it's all right
to run!

20:31.460 --> 20:33.728
You know, I was kind of
digging Fortress 13--

20:33.796 --> 20:35.063
neat costumes, rhyming Artie--

20:35.130 --> 20:36.698
but that in there,
not okay.

20:36.765 --> 20:38.500
That was not
part of the game.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.502
The quicksand,
that executioner guy,

20:40.570 --> 20:42.003
none of this
is supposed to be happening.

20:42.071 --> 20:43.471
Me and Jerry
were just playing along,

20:43.539 --> 20:46.441
and then all of a sudden
things got weird and scary.

20:46.509 --> 20:47.609
Weird and scary.

20:47.677 --> 20:49.277
Sounds like the artifact
did something.

20:49.345 --> 20:51.146
Yeah, which is why we don't
play with them, Fargo,

20:51.214 --> 20:52.548
or mix 'em with video games.

20:52.616 --> 20:54.583
Yeah, okay, I'll admit,
not my finest idea,

20:54.651 --> 20:57.320
but it was so innocent.
Beatrix Potter's tea set.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.654
What's the worst
that could happen?

20:58.722 --> 21:00.089
Talking bunnies?

21:00.157 --> 21:01.924
I think we just met
the worst that could happen,

21:01.992 --> 21:03.592
and that talking bunny
has a very big axe.

21:05.161 --> 21:06.495
Hey.

21:06.563 --> 21:08.564
Pete, Fargo's breathing
is back to normal.

21:08.631 --> 21:10.332
Yeah, yeah,
we found the little guy.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.367
Jerry's still awol.

21:11.435 --> 21:12.734
And I think the tea set's

21:12.802 --> 21:14.336
starting to put a little bit
of a whammy on us.

21:14.404 --> 21:15.504
You find anything else out?

21:15.571 --> 21:16.872
Potter's first editions

21:16.939 --> 21:18.874
are more like dream journals
than stories,

21:18.941 --> 21:19.875
and they're dark.

21:19.942 --> 21:21.176
In this one story,

21:21.243 --> 21:22.911
Peter Rabbit chews off
his own leg

21:22.979 --> 21:25.246
to escape
farmer McGregor's trap.

21:25.314 --> 21:26.715
That was not
on <i>Reading Rainbow.</i>

21:26.782 --> 21:28.183
Guys, what if the tea set

21:28.250 --> 21:29.985
doesn't just
enhance your imagination?

21:30.052 --> 21:32.221
What if it also
brings out the darker parts

21:32.288 --> 21:34.289
of--of your subconscious?

21:34.357 --> 21:36.192
I used to have nightmares
about drowning.

21:36.259 --> 21:37.460
And you wound up
in quicksand.

21:37.528 --> 21:38.895
That must be
what's happening.

21:38.963 --> 21:40.664
The tea set brings your fears
to life in the game.

21:40.731 --> 21:42.866
Fantastic.
What about the executioner?

21:42.934 --> 21:44.334
Well,
that must come from Jerry.

21:44.402 --> 21:46.336
Most of my nightmares
are about me losing my hair.

21:46.404 --> 21:47.237
- Me too!
- Really?

21:47.305 --> 21:48.471
Yeah, do ever put the--

21:48.539 --> 21:49.906
Hey, you can trade
beauty tips later.

21:49.974 --> 21:51.842
I'll figure out what's
going on in Jerry's head,

21:51.910 --> 21:56.881
and you guys just find him,
and then get out of there.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.383
So without the controllers,
how do we get out of the game?

21:59.451 --> 22:01.219
Well, the only way
to shut off the braid

22:01.286 --> 22:02.787
would be to finish the game.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.022
Which Jerry would know.

22:04.089 --> 22:06.190
He must have gone
to the Black Tower.

22:08.927 --> 22:10.327
Right.

22:10.395 --> 22:12.229
Save the princess,
finish the game.

22:12.296 --> 22:14.097
To the Black Tower!

22:19.604 --> 22:21.171
I never thought
I'd say this,

22:21.238 --> 22:24.408
but let's save us
a princess.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.612
How am I supposed to know
what's in Jerry's subconscious?

22:28.680 --> 22:29.780
All we ever talk about

22:29.848 --> 22:31.148
is video games
and fantasy football.

22:31.216 --> 22:34.953
Why are all men
emotionally stunted?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.922
I need a woman.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.123
Yeah, you and me both.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.793
No, no, I mean,
I need to find...

22:40.860 --> 22:43.829
Are you gonna
get me a woman?

22:43.897 --> 22:47.399
Because if you are,
I'd like to change.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.935
Okay, Jerry's girlfriend,
the girl on the mug,

22:50.003 --> 22:51.104
who is she?

22:51.171 --> 22:54.406
Oh, uh, Sarah.
Or Susan. Melissa?

22:54.474 --> 22:55.707
You don't know her name?

22:55.775 --> 22:58.176
Hey, look,
for the last year,

22:58.244 --> 23:01.179
I've been working 24/7
on building the braid.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.481
I don't even really
remember your name.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.049
What are you doing?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.218
I am going
through Jerry's calls.

23:07.285 --> 23:08.885
Okay, most of them
are from Fargo.

23:08.953 --> 23:10.420
Aha. Hannah.

23:10.488 --> 23:11.955
He called Hannah last week.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.656
Right. Hannah.

23:13.724 --> 23:16.326
Yeah, right.
Hannah.

23:19.463 --> 23:21.531
So you're just gonna
substitute a forgery

23:21.598 --> 23:22.598
for a priceless work of art,

23:22.666 --> 23:23.666
and hope nobody notices?

23:23.734 --> 23:25.568
Shh, shh.

23:25.636 --> 23:26.769
There--there's someone there.

23:26.837 --> 23:28.905
Can you check?

23:36.947 --> 23:38.581
You know it's blank,
right?

23:38.648 --> 23:40.316
Observe.

23:50.493 --> 23:51.627
Nice.

23:51.695 --> 23:52.861
It's memory paper

23:52.929 --> 23:54.797
from Johannes Gutenberg's
printing press.

23:54.864 --> 23:57.299
Van Gogh himself
wouldn't know the difference.

23:57.367 --> 23:58.867
No one.
You're hearing things.

23:58.935 --> 24:01.270
Shut my mouth!
How'd you do that?

24:01.338 --> 24:02.804
- It's from Johannes Guten--
- Really?

24:02.872 --> 24:05.073
I...Don't know.

24:05.141 --> 24:08.077
Yeah, let's just
make the swap, shall we?

24:08.144 --> 24:09.111
Here.
Put these on.

24:09.179 --> 24:10.746
Ooh,
we gonna do some dishes?

24:10.813 --> 24:11.913
Just kidding.

24:11.981 --> 24:13.615
So is this like
that thing in Denver?

24:13.682 --> 24:15.951
It's a work of art
with bad juju?

24:16.019 --> 24:17.219
Yeah.

24:17.287 --> 24:20.322
No.

24:20.389 --> 24:21.557
So how we gonna
get it out of here?

24:21.624 --> 24:23.058
We have to cut it out, or--

24:24.494 --> 24:25.928
Oh, sorry.
Dust.

24:25.995 --> 24:26.895
Artie.
Artie, look.

24:28.298 --> 24:30.599
Get down!

24:35.205 --> 24:36.772
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no...

24:36.840 --> 24:37.673
Hold on!
Hold on!

24:37.741 --> 24:39.909
No, no, no!

24:39.976 --> 24:42.478
Ah!

24:57.862 --> 25:00.131
This thing is activated
by a puff of air.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.332
When you sneezed,

25:01.400 --> 25:03.968
that's what triggered
the effect.

25:04.035 --> 25:07.204
Who in the hell
are you people?

25:07.272 --> 25:10.640
Ha, yeah,
well, if I had a nickel.

25:10.707 --> 25:12.842
Come on.
We're gonna swap this out still.

25:15.446 --> 25:16.579
Hello?

25:16.647 --> 25:18.014
What's going on?

25:18.082 --> 25:19.115
Hannah, I--I'm...

25:19.183 --> 25:20.416
Jerry?
Oh, my God.

25:20.484 --> 25:22.785
Uh,
don't touch the headband.

25:22.853 --> 25:24.888
Jerry. Jerry.

25:24.955 --> 25:26.556
Jerry, come on, wake up.

25:26.624 --> 25:28.558
Jerry. Jerry.

25:28.625 --> 25:33.029
What's wrong with him?

25:33.097 --> 25:35.165
Look, I can't even pretend
to understand

25:35.233 --> 25:36.366
what you're trying
to tell me.

25:36.434 --> 25:38.001
Lost in the game?

25:38.069 --> 25:39.636
Do you work for Fargo too?

25:39.703 --> 25:41.338
No. No, no, no.
God no.

25:41.405 --> 25:44.273
I'm just here to lend a hand.

25:44.341 --> 25:47.076
Hannah, look, what's going on
in there with them,

25:47.144 --> 25:49.445
it has to do with your
boyfriend's subconscious.

25:49.512 --> 25:51.046
I need to know
more about him.

25:51.113 --> 25:53.481
Jerry's not
my boyfriend anymore.

25:53.549 --> 25:54.749
We broke up last week.

25:54.817 --> 25:58.719
Last week?

25:58.787 --> 26:01.655
What, you think our breakup
has something to do with this?

26:01.723 --> 26:04.358
Just--just tell me
what happened, okay?

26:04.426 --> 26:08.396
I wanted more.
Something serious.

26:08.464 --> 26:10.566
Jerry kept saying
that he wanted the same thing,

26:10.634 --> 26:13.002
but the time wasn't right.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.737
He wanted Fargames
to get off the ground,

26:14.805 --> 26:16.005
and I believed him.

26:16.073 --> 26:17.507
I even found the ring
that he bought me,

26:17.575 --> 26:19.542
but he never asked.

26:19.610 --> 26:21.211
I waited for months,

26:21.278 --> 26:23.579
and finally
I just told him it was over.

26:23.647 --> 26:26.816
I haven't really
talked to him since.

26:26.884 --> 26:28.718
Is he gonna be okay?

26:32.756 --> 26:36.057
Well, not as smooth as when
we got <i>Whistler's Mother,</i>

26:36.125 --> 26:38.326
but not a bad grab.

26:38.394 --> 26:40.027
Oh, well, that's something
I'd rather not know about.

26:40.095 --> 26:41.195
No--

26:43.031 --> 26:45.266
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>
is longer than that.

26:47.237 --> 26:49.805
Sally!

26:49.872 --> 26:51.773
She's got the van Gogh.

27:04.272 --> 27:09.676
Ooh, man.
My kilt is chafing.

27:09.744 --> 27:10.978
Thanks for coming,
by the way.

27:11.045 --> 27:12.613
Believe me,
if a black hole or an evil robot

27:12.680 --> 27:13.614
shows up at the warehouse,

27:13.681 --> 27:16.116
you're on my speed dial too.

27:16.184 --> 27:18.485
I hope the princess
has some gold bond.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.787
Just let me open the door,
okay?

27:20.855 --> 27:22.856
Can't wait
to meet this princess.

27:22.924 --> 27:24.457
Uh, before we go inside,

27:24.525 --> 27:26.560
there's something
I should tell you.

27:28.129 --> 27:32.565
What?

27:32.633 --> 27:34.867
Brave heroes!

27:34.935 --> 27:36.702
You've come to save me!

27:36.770 --> 27:38.938
I'm the princess?

27:39.005 --> 27:41.406
Really?
You didn't see this coming?

27:41.474 --> 27:44.675
I will compose a ballad
in your honor.

27:48.814 --> 27:51.582
What are those things
on my chest?

27:51.650 --> 27:53.351
Freckles?

27:53.418 --> 27:57.689
Okay, uh, game over.
Princess saved.

27:57.756 --> 27:59.791
What are we--
what are we doing here?

28:06.399 --> 28:07.566
Jerry?

28:07.634 --> 28:09.268
Jerry!
Guys, this is Jerry.

28:09.336 --> 28:10.770
It--how did you get here?

28:10.838 --> 28:11.771
What's wrong with him?

28:11.839 --> 28:14.274
Aah! Aah!

28:22.415 --> 28:24.883
Oh, crap.

28:24.951 --> 28:26.217
Brave hero.

28:26.285 --> 28:28.452
You've come to rescue me.

28:28.520 --> 28:33.123
Aah!

28:33.191 --> 28:36.027
Okay. All right.

28:36.094 --> 28:37.928
It's just you and me.

28:41.199 --> 28:43.567
It's just you.

28:46.838 --> 28:49.973
Pete, come on, wake up.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.141
Wake up.

28:55.313 --> 28:58.716
Wait, Hannah, please--

28:58.783 --> 28:59.884
Pete.
Pete, Pete, Pete.

28:59.951 --> 29:02.353
Who's Hannah?

29:05.758 --> 29:07.492
- Pete.
- Come on, wake up, Pete.

29:13.665 --> 29:17.135
No, no, no.

29:25.078 --> 29:28.547
Aah!

29:32.452 --> 29:33.819
Whew.

29:33.886 --> 29:35.320
Somebody needs a tic tac.

29:36.823 --> 29:39.158
Um, okay,
what is happening?

29:39.225 --> 29:40.726
What's going on?

29:40.794 --> 29:42.895
Uh, everyone's heart rates
just started elevating.

29:42.963 --> 29:45.098
Oh, God.
Jerry's is almost at 230.

29:45.165 --> 29:48.669
How much faster can it go
before it just explodes?

29:48.736 --> 29:50.638
Pete, can you hear me?
What's going on in there?

29:50.705 --> 29:53.273
Myka,
is Jerry still alive?

29:53.341 --> 29:55.142
Yes, but his pulse
is skyrocketing.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.810
Listen,
I think his anxiety

29:56.878 --> 29:58.112
comes from his ex-girlfriend.

29:58.179 --> 29:59.313
Yeah, whose doesn't?

29:59.381 --> 30:01.148
Hannah, yeah,
I think we just met her.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.350
Nice girl. Big axe.

30:03.418 --> 30:06.220
Pete, listen,
you need to stay calm.

30:06.288 --> 30:07.555
In the story...

30:07.622 --> 30:09.790
...literally consumed...

30:09.858 --> 30:11.759
...his fears...

30:11.826 --> 30:13.227
Uh, what--
am I--am I losing you?

30:14.295 --> 30:15.796
Ugh.

30:15.864 --> 30:18.198
Of course I am.
Great.

30:20.835 --> 30:22.135
The line went dead.

30:22.203 --> 30:25.905
Myka, Gibson, is anyone
in reality reading me?

30:25.973 --> 30:29.708
I don't understand.
It should be working.

30:29.776 --> 30:31.910
Possibly my fault.

30:31.978 --> 30:34.780
Well, I started thinking about
how much scarier it'd be

30:34.848 --> 30:36.081
if we lost communications.

30:36.149 --> 30:37.282
Did you not hear the part

30:37.350 --> 30:39.284
about this place
making our fears real?

30:39.352 --> 30:41.219
Hey, it's your fault
we're stuck in here, Paul.

30:41.287 --> 30:43.421
And what's the deal with Puff
the Magic Dragon out there?

30:43.489 --> 30:44.789
Yeah?
Whose fear is that?

30:44.857 --> 30:48.192
Uh, well, no, that's actually
just part of the game.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.328
What?
Dragons are awesome.

30:50.396 --> 30:51.630
Besides,
to get past it,

30:51.698 --> 30:53.164
all we need
is the Dagger of Josephine!

30:56.069 --> 30:59.172
I said,
"The Dagger of Josephine!"

31:00.608 --> 31:03.477
Which I may have forgot
to program into the game.

31:03.544 --> 31:04.845
A game. A game.

31:04.912 --> 31:06.146
That's right.
This is a game.

31:06.214 --> 31:08.049
So how about
if I just close my eyes,

31:08.116 --> 31:10.985
jump, and float
gently to the ground?

31:11.052 --> 31:13.521
Wait.
Hold the phone, Spartacus.

31:13.588 --> 31:14.855
Boon goes the dynamite.

31:14.923 --> 31:16.857
Excellent.
I'll get to see them again.

31:16.925 --> 31:19.159
Her. Leena.
I'll get to see Leena again.

31:20.595 --> 31:23.029
Greetings, player.
Have you chosen your boon?

31:23.097 --> 31:25.698
And her two
humongous wings.

31:25.766 --> 31:28.200
Can you fly us out of here
to where Jerry is?

31:28.268 --> 31:31.237
If that is your wish,
my steed will aid you.

31:31.305 --> 31:32.672
Steed?

31:42.384 --> 31:43.384
Shotgun.

31:43.452 --> 31:45.420
- Oh.
- Yes.

31:46.922 --> 31:48.356
Stukowski played us.

31:48.424 --> 31:49.758
Why would she
want an artifact?

31:49.825 --> 31:51.860
That van Gogh's worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

31:51.927 --> 31:53.561
Probably doesn't even care
it's an artifact.

31:53.629 --> 31:54.863
She's a sworn FBI Agent.

31:54.930 --> 31:59.567
Hundreds of millions.

31:59.635 --> 32:01.503
Look, why don't we
just tell the cops who we are?

32:01.570 --> 32:03.138
We're on the same team.

32:03.205 --> 32:06.640
Yeah. NSA and ATF, both
burglarizing an art gallery.

32:06.708 --> 32:08.442
That won't lead
to too many questions.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.810
All right, gents.

32:09.878 --> 32:11.678
Let's all go down
to 1 Police Plaza, shall we?

32:11.746 --> 32:13.413
My boss wants to meet you.

32:13.481 --> 32:16.083
Hold it.
Sally Stukowski, FBI.

32:16.150 --> 32:17.217
These men are working for me

32:17.285 --> 32:18.686
on a very important
terrorism case.

32:18.754 --> 32:20.888
Terrorism.
In an art gallery?

32:20.956 --> 32:22.424
Black market sale of art

32:22.491 --> 32:23.692
has been used
to fund numerous

32:23.759 --> 32:25.761
radical organizations
in the past few years.

32:25.829 --> 32:28.397
These men were helping me
to identify a potential forgery.

32:28.465 --> 32:30.800
We're nearing the end
of a ten-month operation,

32:30.868 --> 32:32.402
and I need
a confirmation tonight.

32:32.470 --> 32:33.970
I already have full authority
on this crime scene

32:34.038 --> 32:35.271
from my field office.

32:35.339 --> 32:37.908
Do I need to take it up
with your Lieutenant?

32:37.975 --> 32:40.410
Um, take 'em.

32:40.477 --> 32:41.811
Chop, chop.

32:41.879 --> 32:43.546
Told you.

32:51.155 --> 32:54.525
Hannah,
why are you doing this?

32:54.592 --> 32:56.360
Look, I'm sorry.
I couldn't ask.

32:56.428 --> 32:58.129
I just--

32:58.196 --> 32:59.697
I just--
look, I was afraid.

32:59.765 --> 33:00.765
I was afraid you'd say no.

33:00.832 --> 33:04.035
I--I wanted to.
I was afraid!

33:04.103 --> 33:05.837
I couldn't commit.

33:05.905 --> 33:08.807
I've had so many relationships
that ended like that.

33:08.875 --> 33:11.910
She can't really cut off
his head, though, right?

33:11.978 --> 33:13.712
I mean, not for real.

33:13.780 --> 33:14.946
I don't know.

33:15.014 --> 33:17.082
I mean, if his fear
kills him in here,

33:17.149 --> 33:19.383
it might be able
to kill him out there.

33:23.154 --> 33:24.087
You okay?

33:24.155 --> 33:25.656
It's just this fear thing.

33:25.723 --> 33:28.058
You ever try so hard
not to think about something

33:28.126 --> 33:29.292
till it's all
you can think about?

33:29.360 --> 33:31.161
Yeah, all the time.

33:31.229 --> 33:33.697
Miss Donovan.

33:37.135 --> 33:40.237
This is another delusion,
dear.

33:40.305 --> 33:44.108
Dr. Michener?

33:44.176 --> 33:46.611
Who's that?

33:46.678 --> 33:48.612
No, he's nobody.
He's not real.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.847
He's not here.

33:49.915 --> 33:52.483
None of this is real,
Claudia.

33:52.550 --> 33:55.586
You're just an emotionally
troubled young woman.

33:55.653 --> 33:56.753
No.

33:56.821 --> 33:59.722
Your brother is dead.

34:01.925 --> 34:03.726
No! No!

34:03.794 --> 34:05.094
Let me go!

34:05.162 --> 34:06.662
You're not real!

34:06.729 --> 34:08.163
You've been living
a delusion.

34:08.231 --> 34:10.899
One you created
to make yourself feel safe,

34:10.967 --> 34:13.835
a warehouse where you could hide
from the real world.

34:13.902 --> 34:16.071
But it's a lie, Claudia.

34:16.139 --> 34:19.542
You've been in this institution
the whole time.

34:19.610 --> 34:21.511
With me.

34:21.579 --> 34:24.047
- Don't listen to him, Claudia.
- No, Claudia, we're real.

34:24.114 --> 34:25.315
Please!

34:25.382 --> 34:26.783
No! Don't!

34:26.851 --> 34:28.318
You need your treatment,
Claudia.

34:28.386 --> 34:29.920
Aah!

34:33.139 --> 34:34.505
Oh, man, this is bad!

34:34.574 --> 34:35.940
Something really bad
is happening!

34:36.009 --> 34:37.141
I'm totally freaking out,
man!

34:37.210 --> 34:42.081
Gibson, snap out of it!

34:42.148 --> 34:44.817
Aah!

34:44.885 --> 34:46.418
You've been hiding.

34:46.485 --> 34:49.021
You'll feel better
after your treatment.

34:49.089 --> 34:50.789
You always do.

34:58.798 --> 35:00.265
You know what, Doc?

35:00.333 --> 35:02.234
I do feel better now.

35:11.278 --> 35:12.211
Myka.

35:12.279 --> 35:13.613
Is that really you?

35:13.681 --> 35:16.016
Yeah.

35:16.083 --> 35:18.018
Oh.
You went with dominatrix, huh?

35:18.086 --> 35:19.019
Good choice.

35:19.087 --> 35:21.589
Don't make me get my whip.

35:26.662 --> 35:28.230
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

35:31.734 --> 35:33.969
Are you okay?

35:35.338 --> 35:37.273
I wasn't expecting
a catharsis today,

35:37.340 --> 35:40.108
but that actually felt
pretty good.

35:40.176 --> 35:41.810
Yeah, thanks, Mykes.

35:41.878 --> 35:45.414
Okay, guys, look,
we have to save Jerry,

35:45.481 --> 35:47.115
and get our controllers
back from evil Hannah.

35:47.183 --> 35:48.650
But how?

35:48.718 --> 35:50.685
I mean, she's been kicking
our butt since we got here.

35:50.753 --> 35:53.055
Wait.
I was stuck in the quicksand,

35:53.122 --> 35:54.289
but when I saw you guys,

35:54.357 --> 35:56.224
it gave me the courage
to pull myself out.

35:56.292 --> 35:59.061
Right.
And Myka distracted him,

35:59.129 --> 36:00.562
but I had to be the one
to finish the Doc.

36:00.630 --> 36:02.031
You have to take down
your own fears.

36:02.099 --> 36:04.534
Right. Okay.
We got to get traumatized Jerry

36:04.602 --> 36:06.136
to nut up
before he loses his head.

36:06.203 --> 36:08.738
Myka, Claudia,
you go talk to him.

36:08.806 --> 36:09.939
We'll distract the ex.

36:10.007 --> 36:14.010
Let's go get
medieval on her ass.

36:14.078 --> 36:15.545
One, two, three, break!

36:15.613 --> 36:18.848
- Break.
- Okay, that's...

36:18.916 --> 36:20.950
Just--

36:25.088 --> 36:26.589
Sorry I ran off.

36:26.657 --> 36:28.157
Didn't really have
much of a choice.

36:28.225 --> 36:29.625
Figured I'd catch up
with you two

36:29.693 --> 36:31.961
once I got the painting
back to a safe place.

36:32.029 --> 36:34.330
I don't really like
lying to policemen.

36:34.398 --> 36:39.136
Well, trust me,
you're good at it.

36:39.204 --> 36:42.338
You have our number,
Agent Stukowski?

36:42.406 --> 36:44.307
All right, then.

36:44.375 --> 36:45.942
So catch you later.

36:52.283 --> 36:53.817
What is it, Artie?

36:53.885 --> 36:56.053
Something.

37:11.267 --> 37:12.567
Hannah,
I never wanted it to end.

37:12.635 --> 37:15.104
I just--I just--

37:15.172 --> 37:17.640
I just wanted
to be more for you.

37:17.708 --> 37:18.607
Hey, you old battle axe!

37:18.675 --> 37:20.643
Hyah!

37:20.710 --> 37:23.412
Oh, you gonna make the
super-scary monster face, huh?

37:23.480 --> 37:24.580
She's gonna make
the super-scary monster face.

37:27.051 --> 37:29.085
Bring it, bi-atch.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.101
How am I doing?

37:44.938 --> 37:46.772
Jerry,
everything's gonna be okay.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.173
Doesn't matter.

37:48.241 --> 37:49.875
I'll never be good enough
for her or anybody.

37:56.382 --> 37:59.317
Hey, lady!

37:59.385 --> 38:01.152
You had that thing
the whole time?

38:01.220 --> 38:02.420
I think we've established

38:02.488 --> 38:04.021
I haven't thought this through
very well.

38:04.089 --> 38:05.823
You shall not pass!

38:13.831 --> 38:16.833
Or...After you.

38:16.901 --> 38:21.705
Aah!

38:21.772 --> 38:24.708
Cheater.

38:24.775 --> 38:25.842
Come on.

38:25.910 --> 38:27.244
Jerry, listen,

38:27.311 --> 38:29.079
I know what happened
with Hannah, the real one.

38:29.147 --> 38:30.447
You love her,
but you couldn't propose.

38:30.515 --> 38:31.882
She just would have said no.

38:31.949 --> 38:33.283
This place,
it magnifies your fear,

38:33.351 --> 38:34.851
your--your anxieties.

38:34.919 --> 38:37.621
The proposal, okay?
That's your demon.

38:37.689 --> 38:38.922
Don't let it kill us all.

38:38.990 --> 38:40.424
Come on, Jerry.
Dig deep.

38:40.491 --> 38:42.392
What do you want more than
anything in the world right now?

38:42.460 --> 38:43.427
I--I want Hannah.

38:43.494 --> 38:44.494
Then make it happen.

38:44.562 --> 38:46.263
Go over to her.
Okay.

38:46.331 --> 38:47.664
- Look her in the eye.
- Okay.

38:47.732 --> 38:49.066
And tell her how you feel.

38:49.133 --> 38:51.035
Okay. Okay.

38:51.102 --> 38:52.036
All right.

38:52.104 --> 38:53.638
Let's go.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.406
Aah!

38:55.474 --> 38:56.841
Now, Jerry.

38:56.909 --> 38:59.076
Hannah,
will you marry me?

39:06.651 --> 39:08.052
Jerry.

39:13.859 --> 39:16.227
Congratulations,
players.

39:16.295 --> 39:18.362
The game is complete.

39:18.430 --> 39:23.400
And now let's all
get something to eat.

39:23.468 --> 39:26.303
It's about freakin' time.

39:30.341 --> 39:32.009
Aah, she's back!

39:32.076 --> 39:33.577
Hannah. Hannah.

39:33.645 --> 39:35.046
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:35.113 --> 39:35.947
- It's okay.
- I love you.

39:36.015 --> 39:37.115
I love you too.

39:37.182 --> 39:38.316
I love you,
I love you, I love you.

39:38.384 --> 39:39.918
I like this Hannah better.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.553
Well,
I thought the giant axe

39:41.621 --> 39:42.821
was kind of a turn-on.

39:42.889 --> 39:45.024
I officially know
way too much about you.

39:57.574 --> 40:00.776
Hi.
I, um...

40:00.844 --> 40:03.079
This is my first time
doing anything like this.

40:03.146 --> 40:04.647
Uh,
a really good friend of mine

40:04.715 --> 40:06.983
told me I needed
to get out of my comfort zone.

40:07.050 --> 40:11.287
Um, and then my worst nightmare
sort of told me the same thing,

40:11.354 --> 40:13.422
so it's been
a weird couple of days.

40:13.490 --> 40:15.123
Um, anyway...

40:15.191 --> 40:17.126
Ti--yeah,
tip your barista.

40:17.193 --> 40:18.360
Here we go.
