01:58.045 --> 02:01.878
It's so good to see you.
I... I was afraid you'd cancel.

02:21.712 --> 02:24.711
Hello. We have a reservation
for a double room.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.712
- Your name?
- Emilie Thomson.

02:28.844 --> 02:29.846
Ines Thomson.

02:39.612 --> 02:42.046
So, let me know if there's
anything you need.

02:42.378 --> 02:43.178
Thank you.

02:46.178 --> 02:49.209
- What a place.
- I wanted to treat us.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.243
- It's huge!
- Yeah.

03:00.245 --> 03:02.079
So nice
to get out of New York.

03:04.812 --> 03:05.976
I... I read some reviews

03:05.978 --> 03:07.712
this morning
about your new exhibition.

03:10.212 --> 03:11.146
That's fine.

03:12.346 --> 03:14.245
I thought they were mean.
I'm sure you worked very hard.

03:16.178 --> 03:17.246
They used to love you.

03:20.078 --> 03:21.178
That's how it goes.

03:22.944 --> 03:24.943
If people don't like my work,

03:24.945 --> 03:26.745
then at least
I make them feel something.

04:15.677 --> 04:17.313
It's very fancy.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.178
I got more than I was expecting
for my flat.

04:24.078 --> 04:28.045
- You've sold your apartment?
- Yeah. I moved out last week.

04:30.712 --> 04:32.709
If... If I'm gonna
go back to my studies,

04:32.711 --> 04:34.178
a student room
will be just fine.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.879
Ladies,
may I take your order?

04:40.312 --> 04:41.545
Um...

04:43.078 --> 04:44.875
I'll have the lobster
and champagne.

04:44.877 --> 04:45.811
Sure.

04:50.777 --> 04:52.012
- The same.
- Excellent.

04:54.645 --> 04:57.646
I found this. Look.

05:07.644 --> 05:09.245
- What's this?
- Mum's ring.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.143
I found it when
I went through my stuff.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.213
I thought you might want it.

05:14.678 --> 05:15.746
No, you keep it.

05:33.344 --> 05:34.279
Cheers.

05:38.112 --> 05:42.213
I'm so glad you came.
Grateful that you took the time.

05:43.678 --> 05:44.612
Of course.

05:53.044 --> 05:54.046
Excuse me.

05:55.112 --> 05:56.545
- Yes?
- Please.

05:57.112 --> 05:59.645
Would one of you beautiful
ladies care to dance?

06:02.878 --> 06:04.112
- Yeah.
- No.

06:04.345 --> 06:05.546
Why not?

06:08.377 --> 06:09.679
Emilie...

06:32.845 --> 06:35.079
So, tell me about yourself,
Emilie.

06:37.744 --> 06:38.945
What is there to say?

06:42.012 --> 06:47.311
I'm nobody. Alone, unimportant,
full of unfulfilled dreams.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.046
Actually, I'm here on a holiday
with my sister.

06:59.712 --> 07:01.375
Now that her career's
not going so well,

07:01.377 --> 07:03.178
she finally agrees to see me.

07:05.877 --> 07:07.045
I don't have time to lie.

07:09.945 --> 07:11.212
And why is that?

07:14.611 --> 07:16.711
Just dance with me, please.

07:27.677 --> 07:28.979
You've got sensitive hands.

07:36.145 --> 07:37.946
I'd love to go to bed with you,
but...

07:39.644 --> 07:42.012
I don't think
that's possible, I'm afraid.

07:43.210 --> 07:44.177
Goodnight.

07:55.645 --> 07:57.146
Emilie?

07:57.345 --> 07:59.545
What happened to you?
Is everything fine?

08:00.611 --> 08:01.579
What's happening?

08:01.944 --> 08:04.612
- What's...
- Get... Get the fuck off!

08:05.978 --> 08:08.078
I probably shouldn't have
drunk champagne.

08:16.311 --> 08:18.578
There's just been a lot going on
in my head.

08:21.177 --> 08:22.311
I just need to relax.

08:25.812 --> 08:28.145
This place we're going to will
be so nice.

08:29.745 --> 08:30.745
So calm.

08:31.945 --> 08:32.945
So peaceful.

08:35.378 --> 08:36.611
It'll be perfect.

08:38.144 --> 08:39.711
Just perfect.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.579
Look.

09:06.111 --> 09:09.811
That's so gorgeous.

09:15.277 --> 09:17.343
- Stop that. No.
- No.

09:17.345 --> 09:19.742
- Emilie, tell me...
- Come on, Ines, it's... It's...

09:19.744 --> 09:21.778
Tell me where we're going.

09:25.844 --> 09:28.611
We're going to the most
beautiful place in the world.

09:29.012 --> 09:31.812
Yeah, you already
said that. Come on.

09:32.745 --> 09:34.746
It's... It's very special.

09:36.211 --> 09:38.646
The question is,
can I have a massage there?

09:41.244 --> 09:43.876
Of course, madam.
As many as you wish.

09:43.878 --> 09:45.712
Oh, good!

09:46.378 --> 09:47.579
Then I'm happy.

10:27.677 --> 10:28.475
Hello?

10:28.477 --> 10:30.177
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

10:31.811 --> 10:34.212
- Hello. Can you hear me?
- <i>Who is this?</i>

10:37.044 --> 10:38.145
Well, I, um...

10:39.878 --> 10:43.979
I saw the... The press photo
you're using and...

10:45.677 --> 10:46.945
<i>The one that you agreed on?</i>

10:48.077 --> 10:50.242
Well, I want you to use the
other one.

10:50.244 --> 10:51.145
<i>Which one?</i>

10:52.178 --> 10:53.712
The one where I'm not smiling.

10:57.645 --> 10:58.611
Hello?

11:12.211 --> 11:13.612
We're leaving the country.

11:15.877 --> 11:17.044
I thought I told you.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.812
Don't worry, it's not far now.

12:07.744 --> 12:08.678
This is it.

12:10.377 --> 12:12.578
Shouldn't they have a signpost
or something?

12:13.344 --> 12:15.944
They probably want to keep it
as anonymous as possible.

12:18.943 --> 12:20.279
Well, they've definitely
succeeded with that.

12:35.911 --> 12:38.712
- You must be Emilie?
- Yes.

12:39.678 --> 12:40.945
And you must be her sister?

12:43.977 --> 12:44.977
And you are?

12:46.011 --> 12:48.712
I'm Marina. I am Emilie's
personal companion.

12:49.845 --> 12:51.141
I'm so glad you made it.

12:51.143 --> 12:53.977
Most of our guests prefer
the helicopter option.

12:55.345 --> 12:59.579
It's a bit of a walk, but if you
get tired, we'll help you.

13:08.943 --> 13:10.311
Are we going through here?

13:11.843 --> 13:13.211
It's not so far, you'll manage.

14:51.210 --> 14:52.211
Here we are.

15:02.678 --> 15:04.078
Is it like you imagined?

15:05.311 --> 15:06.545
Even better.

15:09.978 --> 15:11.778
This is where
most of the guests

15:12.377 --> 15:14.211
love to come on their own,

15:15.043 --> 15:17.578
or their partners or friends

15:18.345 --> 15:22.012
to sit, play chess, be quiet.

15:28.944 --> 15:30.245
That's why I love this house.

15:45.144 --> 15:48.045
You have to sign in first.
Reception is through there.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.777
Let me know
if there's anything you need.

16:03.612 --> 16:06.012
Hello? Hi, welcome.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.278
Please, come in.

16:09.810 --> 16:10.578
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:11.777 --> 16:13.942
Aron.
And you must be Emilie?

16:13.944 --> 16:15.711
- Yeah.
- Please, sit down.

16:20.977 --> 16:24.077
So, first things first.
Passports, please.

16:28.044 --> 16:28.977
Thank you.

16:29.943 --> 16:31.177
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.845
We have a medical certificate,

16:45.077 --> 16:47.644
lawyer's documents
and proof of payment.

16:47.843 --> 16:49.811
So everything seems to be
in order. Thank you.

16:55.143 --> 16:58.675
I'm sure you know
how everything works here,

16:58.677 --> 17:02.608
but I'm legally required to run
it all through with you

17:02.610 --> 17:04.578
in person before
we can continue.

17:07.178 --> 17:09.608
Unlike other organizations,
we offer

17:09.609 --> 17:13.778
our guests a service created
for, and by, the individual.

17:14.077 --> 17:17.911
Freedom of choice is our utmost
concern and serving that choice

17:18.243 --> 17:19.176
is our aim.

17:21.011 --> 17:23.142
There are a selection of
activities you can choose from.

17:23.144 --> 17:24.944
You'll find a schedule
by the front entrance.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.742
We try to accommodate
our guests' unique desires

17:27.743 --> 17:28.878
and wishes in order to make

17:30.110 --> 17:32.677
their final days as fulfilling
and comforting as possible.

17:33.243 --> 17:35.744
Emilie,
should you choose to continue,

17:36.143 --> 17:39.111
your leaving will take place in
six days from now.

17:41.078 --> 17:43.045
Each leaving
is preceded by a bell.

17:44.344 --> 17:46.342
The individual is taken
to the leaving cabin

17:46.344 --> 17:49.276
and is offered a drink
containing a strong sedative

17:49.278 --> 17:51.811
- that will put them to sleep.
- What do you mean?

17:52.911 --> 17:55.945
The choice to drink is
left entirely to the individual.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.642
A week later,
the body will be transported

17:59.644 --> 18:01.011
to the address you
have provided.

18:02.345 --> 18:03.978
Photographs are not permitted.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.044
Do you have any questions?

18:11.044 --> 18:12.078
Where are my bags?

18:12.744 --> 18:14.745
I don't know.

18:15.643 --> 18:18.211
Well, can you go and get
somebody to get my bags.

18:19.310 --> 18:22.208
Try to calm down. I'm not well.

18:22.210 --> 18:23.811
Your bags are already
in your room.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.241
- I will take you there.
- What are you doing?

18:28.243 --> 18:29.810
- It's okay.
- What the...

18:30.044 --> 18:31.711
Don't you fucking touch me!

18:36.311 --> 18:39.909
You do not have to do anything.
You just have to stay with me.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.211
What do you mean
you're not well?

18:45.711 --> 18:46.845
What are you talking about?

18:48.978 --> 18:50.178
I'm gonna have a shower.

18:51.244 --> 18:52.845
We can talk when
you've calmed down.

18:53.244 --> 18:55.709
I'm not going to calm down!
I want you to tell me

18:55.711 --> 18:57.678
- what is going on!
- I just want a shower!

19:04.210 --> 19:06.111
I was diagnosed
three years ago.

19:08.010 --> 19:10.577
I had chemo, but it didn't work.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.645
It's everywhere.

19:17.743 --> 19:19.144
I don't have long left.

19:29.243 --> 19:30.610
Why didn't you tell me?

19:33.110 --> 19:34.610
I didn't want to scare you.

19:36.743 --> 19:40.112
I didn't want to give you a
reason... not to come.

19:42.811 --> 19:44.044
I had the right to know.

19:46.610 --> 19:47.544
Really?

19:50.010 --> 19:51.044
I don't think so.

20:01.210 --> 20:02.211
I tried.

20:03.843 --> 20:04.844
I tried to call.

20:06.177 --> 20:07.311
But you didn't pick up.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.177
I waited, but you
never called back.

20:18.311 --> 20:21.212
A while later you emailed
saying you were busy.

20:24.345 --> 20:25.611
And then...

20:29.776 --> 20:30.777
I don't know.

20:33.345 --> 20:34.811
Time went by and...

20:35.978 --> 20:37.012
I lost the words.

20:54.644 --> 20:55.810
And this place?

21:03.876 --> 21:05.777
This is how I want to leave.

22:08.377 --> 22:09.279
Emilie?

22:58.211 --> 22:59.278
Sugar Puffs?

23:00.244 --> 23:02.145
Yeah. We always had them
when we were little.

23:02.910 --> 23:03.811
Don't you remember?

23:05.110 --> 23:06.111
No.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.810
Mum's blueberry pancakes.

23:10.277 --> 23:11.710
I sent them the recipe.

23:17.911 --> 23:18.845
Perfect.

23:22.677 --> 23:25.642
I'm sorry if you feel
like I don't respect you,

23:25.644 --> 23:27.878
but I really think that we
should get out of here.

23:29.844 --> 23:31.178
You need proper care.

23:33.310 --> 23:36.045
If you leave...
I'll still do it.

23:45.743 --> 23:48.243
Have some pancakes.
They're good.

24:09.943 --> 24:11.009
Jesus.

24:18.177 --> 24:20.711
- Good morning.
- Morning.

24:21.944 --> 24:23.678
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

24:24.242 --> 24:27.275
And breakfast was wonderful.
Everything just as I wanted.

24:27.277 --> 24:28.678
I'm glad to hear that!

24:29.877 --> 24:31.112
And, Ines, how are you today?

24:32.877 --> 24:33.810
Fine.

24:35.611 --> 24:37.678
- Well, I thought that...
- Excuse me, um...

24:39.343 --> 24:41.645
What are you doing
with these people?

24:43.242 --> 24:45.077
- We're helping them.
- Really?

24:48.111 --> 24:51.778
We can't save their lives, but
these last days are important.

24:52.610 --> 24:54.877
So people can leave in the
right way for them.

24:57.744 --> 25:01.278
This is a free zone.
Without the world to judge.

25:06.744 --> 25:08.711
So, Emilie, what would you
like to do today?

25:11.043 --> 25:14.644
I was hoping the three of us
could sit and talk.

25:15.811 --> 25:17.012
- Of course.
- About...

25:18.110 --> 25:19.144
- Follow me.
- Emilie...

25:39.610 --> 25:40.777
No music, thank you.

25:54.276 --> 25:56.811
So... Emilie?

26:01.011 --> 26:03.177
There's some things I wanted
to talk about so...

26:04.978 --> 26:06.177
I wrote them down.

26:13.911 --> 26:16.277
I've never been able
to control my feelings.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.278
Everything has always flooded
straight into me.

26:23.677 --> 26:24.778
My sister...

26:26.343 --> 26:28.844
on the other hand,
has always been very clear.

26:30.644 --> 26:34.175
She can turn her emotions on and
off, feeling exactly what

26:34.177 --> 26:36.211
she wants to feel,
when she wants to feel it.

26:39.376 --> 26:41.710
It all began when Dad left
with another woman.

26:43.243 --> 26:45.311
I was nine, my sister was seven.

26:46.711 --> 26:48.912
Mum never got over it.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.110
I stayed by her side.

26:52.911 --> 26:55.610
I tried to stop her from
slipping through the gaps.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.645
But there was no way.

27:00.943 --> 27:05.744
Five years ago,
she hung herself in the woods.

27:05.944 --> 27:06.945
Just stop it.

27:14.877 --> 27:15.978
What are you doing?

27:21.209 --> 27:23.143
What could she possibly say
about that?

27:26.277 --> 27:28.741
You told me yesterday
that you were dying,

27:28.743 --> 27:32.010
and now you want me
to sit here, in this place,

27:32.776 --> 27:35.942
in front of this woman
and talk about our childhood.

27:35.944 --> 27:37.075
Is that what you want?

27:37.077 --> 27:38.745
You never wanted
to talk about it.

27:46.010 --> 27:47.644
I don't need to listen to this.

28:08.376 --> 28:09.777
Goddamn this.

29:36.076 --> 29:38.677
Those charming bells of death.

29:55.744 --> 29:57.244
I don't think that's allowed.

30:00.610 --> 30:02.144
It's personal, for inspiration.

30:12.875 --> 30:14.744
So, you're above
the rules, are you?

30:18.010 --> 30:19.077
Art's above the rules.

30:23.076 --> 30:24.876
I don't dislike rules.

30:27.042 --> 30:27.976
It's just that I have never

30:28.976 --> 30:30.544
found any sufficiently
worthwhile to follow.

30:35.076 --> 30:37.677
I understand everything.

30:38.843 --> 30:39.810
Hmm.

30:42.344 --> 30:44.710
But I have yet to find the
meaning in anything.

30:52.209 --> 30:53.710
Can I take a photo of you?

30:56.042 --> 30:57.176
Yes, all right.

31:21.110 --> 31:23.877
I have a stage three terminal
brain tumor.

31:25.742 --> 31:27.677
What about you?
You don't look sick.

31:27.875 --> 31:30.111
- I'm here with my sister.
- Oh.

31:32.343 --> 31:33.776
Is she artistic too?

31:38.076 --> 31:39.044
No.

31:42.009 --> 31:43.143
It's just me.

31:48.076 --> 31:49.111
It keeps me together.

31:53.644 --> 31:54.877
I don't understand this place.

31:59.376 --> 32:02.243
<i>People seem to think that
there's some kind of meaning.</i>

32:03.743 --> 32:06.645
<i>Something they should be able
to understand before they die.</i>

32:08.776 --> 32:12.645
<i>There's nothing to understand.
You just die.</i>

32:15.942 --> 32:17.307
<i>They refuse to accept
that their lives</i>

32:17.309 --> 32:19.210
<i>are completely meaningless.</i>

32:20.142 --> 32:21.244
<i>Especially women.</i>

32:24.042 --> 32:27.644
<i>I mean, why would a life
suddenly become important</i>

32:27.875 --> 32:29.577
<i>only because
you are about to die?</i>

32:34.675 --> 32:36.577
People come here and give up.

32:39.611 --> 32:40.378
It's pathetic.

32:42.943 --> 32:44.645
So, what's the alternative?

32:47.344 --> 32:49.910
Carry on with futile
hospital treatment?

32:51.775 --> 32:56.876
More suffering for even higher
bills? I don't think so.

32:59.743 --> 33:00.710
Thankfully...

33:01.810 --> 33:04.743
places like this allow those of
us who can afford it

33:06.076 --> 33:08.177
to pay for a comfortable death.

33:10.943 --> 33:13.077
In the end, we're all pathetic.

33:15.242 --> 33:17.243
That's quite artistic,
don't you think?

33:18.876 --> 33:19.844
Hmm?

33:26.076 --> 33:28.910
"Both its end and its beginning,

33:29.377 --> 33:35.177
sense that here and now is both
your departure and return.

33:36.343 --> 33:39.244
Sense how death and life

33:40.310 --> 33:43.278
are as strong
as wine inside you!

33:45.676 --> 33:46.578
Yes.

33:47.842 --> 33:49.544
To be one with the night...

33:51.077 --> 33:52.743
one with myself...

33:55.076 --> 33:58.877
with the candles flame which
looks me in the eyes still,

34:00.276 --> 34:02.976
unfathomable and still.

34:05.110 --> 34:10.011
One with the aspen
that trembles and whispers.

34:12.309 --> 34:15.011
One with the crowds of flowers

34:15.310 --> 34:17.375
leaning out of darkness

34:17.377 --> 34:20.844
to listen to something I had
on my tongue to say...

34:22.141 --> 34:23.676
but never got said.

34:26.876 --> 34:30.777
Something I don't want to
reveal, even if I could.

34:33.277 --> 34:35.710
- And it murmurs..."
- I'm sorry.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.110
"...of purest happiness.

34:40.176 --> 34:41.877
And the flame rises.

34:43.609 --> 34:50.243
It is as though the flowers
crowded nearer, nearer...

34:51.943 --> 34:53.277
and nearer the light...

34:54.643 --> 34:57.110
in a rainbow
of shimmering points.

34:59.709 --> 35:01.277
Aspen trembles...

35:02.809 --> 35:05.676
- and plays..."
- I'll try my best.

35:09.909 --> 35:14.311
"...and all that was
inexpressible and distant...

35:16.042 --> 35:19.609
is inexpressible and near.

35:23.676 --> 35:26.776
I sing of the only thing
that reconciles...

35:28.642 --> 35:32.976
only of what is practical,
for all alike."

35:35.076 --> 35:36.773
<i>I'm trying to think
about the things</i>

35:36.775 --> 35:38.278
<i>that have been
beautiful in my life.</i>

35:42.243 --> 35:43.211
Like what?

35:46.009 --> 35:50.609
Just... small...
everyday things, really.

35:53.977 --> 35:54.911
Sunrises.

35:57.676 --> 36:00.076
When it's cold in winter
and you come into the warm.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.211
Soft things.

36:08.010 --> 36:11.777
I've never had particularly
great sex.

36:12.676 --> 36:14.044
- No?
- No.

36:16.876 --> 36:18.311
Maybe I was just scared.

36:20.377 --> 36:22.944
I think I've spent my entire
life being scared.

36:28.910 --> 36:29.843
Of what?

36:32.042 --> 36:33.043
Come on.

36:34.343 --> 36:36.943
Tell me about the best sex
you've ever had.

36:42.277 --> 36:45.610
I don't know...
Um...

36:48.376 --> 36:51.943
Well, there was this time...
in Madrid.

36:52.675 --> 36:54.809
It was after a dinner with this
gallery...

36:55.709 --> 36:57.841
owner who invited me
after an exhibition.

36:57.843 --> 36:59.543
You had sex
with a gallery owner?

37:00.143 --> 37:02.877
- Yeah.
- No, no, it wasn't. No.

37:03.775 --> 37:05.976
- It was his son, actually.
- Oh.

37:08.043 --> 37:11.877
And the son had
also a very cute girlfriend.

37:14.809 --> 37:17.709
- Go on.
- Come on!

37:17.910 --> 37:22.210
- What do you want me to say?
- Details. I want details.

37:23.842 --> 37:27.342
No, they... They drove me back
to my hotel and I guess

37:27.344 --> 37:32.278
I had way too much to drink
and I definitely just...

37:32.710 --> 37:35.010
I couldn't guess what...

37:36.843 --> 37:37.844
Well, they just...

37:38.943 --> 37:41.709
asked if they could join me
up to my room, really...

37:42.344 --> 37:43.777
- They did?
- Yeah.

37:47.109 --> 37:48.210
Did you like it?

37:51.609 --> 37:52.576
Yes.

37:53.277 --> 37:54.844
Come on. I want to know.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.010
Really, what do you
want me to say?

38:00.076 --> 38:01.144
Details? Details.

38:02.343 --> 38:04.244
Do you want me to tell how
she unbuttoned my blouse and...

38:04.843 --> 38:07.977
- how she kissed my breasts?
- Yes, yes, you tell me!

38:08.743 --> 38:10.744
- I want to know everything.
- Why?

38:12.710 --> 38:13.743
Because you owe me.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.110
We went up to my room.

38:28.909 --> 38:30.643
She took my hand...

38:31.743 --> 38:33.877
and she laid me down on the bed.

38:34.943 --> 38:36.807
And then she pulled
my knickers aside

38:36.809 --> 38:38.543
and let her tongue glide in.

38:42.776 --> 38:47.177
He unbuttoned his trousers
and walked...

38:47.876 --> 38:49.577
across the room...

38:51.110 --> 38:54.210
towards the bed and I turned
around and I pulled up her skirt

38:56.143 --> 38:59.744
and I licked her beautiful,
wonderful cunt...

39:03.309 --> 39:05.843
while her boyfriend penetrated
me from behind.

39:15.743 --> 39:17.044
Oh, my God!

39:22.676 --> 39:23.644
Happy?

39:24.375 --> 39:25.676
When was this?

39:27.242 --> 39:28.943
I don't know.

39:30.709 --> 39:33.211
Summer, like,
four or five years ago.

39:34.309 --> 39:37.111
August. Five years ago.

40:17.809 --> 40:19.276
How long
have you been awake?

40:22.241 --> 40:24.643
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

40:29.077 --> 40:30.011
What the...

40:31.241 --> 40:32.576
What are you doing?

40:33.842 --> 40:37.809
Do you have any idea how much
work it is to arrange a funeral?

40:40.877 --> 40:43.240
But you won't be arranging mine,
will you?

40:43.242 --> 40:45.810
- Emilie...
- You'll just hire some...

40:47.043 --> 40:49.108
party planner
to sort it all out.

40:49.110 --> 40:50.577
No, don't.

40:51.743 --> 40:55.844
So, while I was...
burying Mum alone,

40:57.042 --> 41:00.010
you were in Madrid having
the best sex of your life.

41:01.776 --> 41:04.608
I just can't stand what goes
through someone's head

41:04.610 --> 41:06.810
when they don't turn up
to their own mother's funeral.

41:12.343 --> 41:14.310
Maybe it was a case of being
constructive.

41:15.175 --> 41:16.576
She was dead already.

41:18.342 --> 41:21.607
You don't automatically become
a better person

41:21.609 --> 41:24.543
just because you've lived your
life in floods of tears.

41:27.842 --> 41:29.306
What the fuck!

41:31.308 --> 41:32.208
What are you doing?

41:32.977 --> 41:34.310
Stop this! Stop this!

41:35.275 --> 41:37.074
What is it? What's happened?

41:37.076 --> 41:38.108
Emilie!

41:38.110 --> 41:41.140
- I can't breathe.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

41:41.142 --> 41:42.773
Shh.

41:42.775 --> 41:45.274
Gently, gently.

41:45.276 --> 41:48.610
I don't want to feel
like this!

41:48.809 --> 41:52.175
I don't want to be the kind of
person who feels like this!

41:52.743 --> 41:55.340
Emilie, you can
do this. You know you can.

41:55.342 --> 41:57.010
Don't be afraid. Come on.

41:57.209 --> 41:59.743
Come on, come on,
you can do this. Come on.

42:00.042 --> 42:01.977
Come on, we'll go to a quiet
place. Come on.

42:10.743 --> 42:12.808
There's no point talking
when you're like this,

42:12.810 --> 42:14.877
- you have to calm down.
- I want to know why.

42:16.743 --> 42:18.044
- What?
- Why don't...

42:19.009 --> 42:21.043
- Don't you respect me?
- Here we go...

42:21.843 --> 42:23.210
You treat me like shit!

42:26.142 --> 42:28.341
You left me to take care of Mum.

42:28.343 --> 42:31.544
In and out of hospital,
just trying to keep her alive.

42:33.309 --> 42:34.911
I waited for you to call.

42:36.176 --> 42:37.841
She asked for you,
do you know that?

42:37.843 --> 42:38.744
No.

42:39.676 --> 42:41.544
And I lied.
Different lies all the time.

42:42.208 --> 42:43.676
"She's swamped with work."

42:44.843 --> 42:47.110
"Yeah, she called yesterday,
but she's broken her leg."

42:48.743 --> 42:51.076
I just couldn't tell her
you didn't give a fuck about us.

42:54.643 --> 42:56.911
You know, I can't be responsible
for your happiness.

42:57.376 --> 43:00.110
It just doesn't work that way.
Life doesn't work that way!

43:01.609 --> 43:03.139
- You're not human.
- Oh, God!

43:03.141 --> 43:04.309
You think like a machine.

43:05.442 --> 43:07.740
You don't get any bonus points
in heaven just because

43:07.742 --> 43:10.243
you walk around feeling
so bloody sorry for yourself!

43:11.242 --> 43:13.374
Maybe that's not the world
you want to live in,

43:13.376 --> 43:14.443
but that's how it is.

43:15.376 --> 43:17.975
That's reality. That's what it's
like to be a grown-up.

43:17.977 --> 43:20.777
Sometimes you have to shut
things out to survive.

43:24.876 --> 43:27.043
That's what
everything's always been about.

43:29.842 --> 43:32.576
You, and your fucking survival.

43:45.842 --> 43:48.109
Scroll down, stop, stop.

43:48.343 --> 43:50.243
Take out any reference
to that woman.

43:51.709 --> 43:53.809
Barking mad. Now...

43:54.810 --> 43:58.039
down to this side, you know,
all those poor people.

43:58.041 --> 43:59.607
Can we get into that?

44:06.276 --> 44:07.210
May I?

44:16.108 --> 44:17.042
Yes, now...

44:18.108 --> 44:20.543
can we make it look
as if I'm hugging a refugee?

44:23.610 --> 44:24.644
What are you doing?

44:25.710 --> 44:27.543
She can tweak things
about you on the net.

44:29.108 --> 44:31.943
So that if anybody Googles you
in a few years' time...

44:33.343 --> 44:34.973
you'll appear to be much nicer

44:34.975 --> 44:36.876
than the person
you perhaps really are.

44:38.376 --> 44:39.310
Emilie?

44:40.309 --> 44:41.911
- Look. I'm sorry.
- Oh.

44:44.676 --> 44:47.243
- Google Ines Thomson.
- What?

44:48.209 --> 44:50.773
- What are you doing?
- Ines Thomson...

44:52.909 --> 44:55.876
Uh, there are some
photos here, several reviews.

44:58.209 --> 45:00.744
Was there something specific
you wanted me to change for you?

45:04.176 --> 45:06.877
Go ahead.
You know how to handle this.

45:08.875 --> 45:09.843
Wait.

45:10.941 --> 45:11.876
Wait!

45:13.142 --> 45:15.143
I understand that you must be
going through hell right now.

45:15.875 --> 45:17.909
You have no fucking idea!

46:37.775 --> 46:38.743
Oh!

46:41.041 --> 46:42.176
I was miles away.

46:49.776 --> 46:50.744
Would you like a drink?

47:09.241 --> 47:10.610
Your sister is scared.

47:15.009 --> 47:16.143
I was naive to bring her here.

47:18.176 --> 47:19.310
You are not naive, Emilie.

47:20.642 --> 47:22.676
You are thoughtful, kind,
and intelligent.

47:24.710 --> 47:26.176
And you've done
everything you can.

47:36.642 --> 47:37.609
Here.

48:02.643 --> 48:03.644
Why are you here?

48:08.875 --> 48:10.677
I came with my husband
two years ago.

48:12.775 --> 48:15.110
- Where is he now?
- He left here.

48:18.874 --> 48:20.176
And you've been here ever since?

48:23.209 --> 48:25.976
I found no reason to go back.

52:32.009 --> 52:33.775
- <i>Stop that. No.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

52:34.076 --> 52:35.140
- <i>Emilie?</i>
- <i>Come on, Ines.</i>

52:35.142 --> 52:38.277
<i>Tell me.
Tell me where we're going?</i>

52:42.609 --> 52:45.043
<i>We're going to the most
beautiful place in the world.</i>

52:45.941 --> 52:47.708
<i>Yeah,
you already said that, come on.</i>

52:48.009 --> 52:50.076
<i>It's... It's very special.</i>

53:10.275 --> 53:11.643
Oh, my back.

53:20.976 --> 53:22.277
This is so nice.

53:26.276 --> 53:27.842
Make sure
everybody has enough.

53:30.941 --> 53:34.307
...with the biggest electricity
bill they've ever had.

53:35.708 --> 53:37.875
Excuse me, uh...

53:38.775 --> 53:41.243
- When's that helicopter leaving?
- Tomorrow morning.

53:43.009 --> 53:44.706
Is there room
for one more person?

53:44.708 --> 53:45.642
Why?

53:46.276 --> 53:48.143
There you are.

53:48.874 --> 53:49.808
Have a drink.

53:52.076 --> 53:54.676
- What's going on?
- It's my farewell party.

53:58.376 --> 54:01.175
I paid them so much money
they couldn't possibly refuse.

54:03.642 --> 54:05.676
Don't be a party pooper! Relax!

I'd like to sleep with you.

56:01.908 --> 56:02.909
What?

56:04.941 --> 56:05.975
Sorry, nothing.

56:08.642 --> 56:09.742
You don't know me.

56:11.642 --> 56:12.809
Does that matter?

56:20.342 --> 56:23.942
I look ridiculous.
I have scars everywhere.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.808
My dick doesn't work.

56:45.675 --> 56:47.043
But when I saw you here...

56:49.874 --> 56:51.642
you were just so beautiful.

57:04.041 --> 57:05.010
Fucking hell.

57:09.042 --> 57:10.239
It's like everything
I'm thinking

57:10.241 --> 57:12.309
is just coming out

57:20.642 --> 57:21.543
Okay.

57:25.842 --> 57:28.643
I didn't mean to force myself on
you in any way.

57:37.274 --> 57:38.942
Right.
More music!

57:39.942 --> 57:42.010

Yeah, enough. That's enough,
enough, enough, enough, enough.

01:00:35.842 --> 01:00:37.242
Oh!

01:00:38.075 --> 01:00:39.943
Talk about flogging
a dead horse.

01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:43.309
Oh, never mind.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:07.808
I want you to comfort me.

01:01:08.909 --> 01:01:11.672
Just give me some...
Put the fucking macaroon down!

01:01:11.674 --> 01:01:13.806
Comfort me!
It's what you're paid for.

01:01:13.808 --> 01:01:16.542
Give me some comfort,
you fucking wanker!

01:01:20.842 --> 01:01:23.839

A fucking amateur!

01:01:27.174 --> 01:01:29.909
Come...

01:01:30.207 --> 01:01:31.941
All right, all right, all right.

01:01:44.275 --> 01:01:45.609
Oh, God...

01:01:48.274 --> 01:01:49.275
Oh!

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.575
Okay. Okay.

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:16.009
I'm ready.

01:02:50.274 --> 01:02:51.908
Are you gonna let him
go out like this?

01:02:52.841 --> 01:02:56.974
Our job is to allow him
to make his own decisions.

01:02:58.241 --> 01:02:59.743
He's free.

01:03:10.774 --> 01:03:14.908
I was a...
professional football player.

01:03:18.975 --> 01:03:20.576
Heading straight to the top.

01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:26.974
I could have been
so fucking good.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.141
What happened?

01:03:37.274 --> 01:03:38.241
Car crash.

01:03:40.873 --> 01:03:41.842
That's all?

01:03:48.807 --> 01:03:50.609
It might not mean much to you.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:54.075
- But for me...
- But, you're...

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:57.942
You're healthy otherwise.
You're not sick.

01:03:59.642 --> 01:04:00.875
It's just your legs?

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:07.543
My whole life went down
the drain when I lost them.

01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:12.175
Everything I was.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.807
- But the rest of your body...
- I hate this body.

01:04:21.308 --> 01:04:23.309
This fucking...

01:04:25.342 --> 01:04:26.676
disability.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.575
I don't know what to do with it.

01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:38.709
It disgusts me.

01:04:43.141 --> 01:04:44.276
How can you say that?

01:05:30.807 --> 01:05:32.141
I can't do this anymore.

01:05:34.175 --> 01:05:35.175
I can see that.

01:05:42.207 --> 01:05:43.576
Can't we just go somewhere?

01:05:46.207 --> 01:05:47.542
Just you and I.

01:05:48.974 --> 01:05:50.109
Before I leave.

01:06:03.074 --> 01:06:04.041
So...

01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:08.543
what will you do
when you get home?

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:16.543
I don't know.

01:06:17.609 --> 01:06:20.042
Of course you do. Tell me.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:23.975
What are you doing next week?

01:06:31.374 --> 01:06:32.576
Um...

01:06:35.341 --> 01:06:36.774
I've ordered some, uh...

01:06:37.975 --> 01:06:41.808
Some new... walls for my studio.

01:06:43.908 --> 01:06:46.975
But I don't know if they're
gonna fit through the back door.

01:06:50.608 --> 01:06:51.609
What else?

01:06:54.873 --> 01:06:55.807
Uh...

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.141
Sleep. Sleep, maybe...

01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:05.909
I'm gonna...

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:12.308
start to look for
my next project.

01:07:15.141 --> 01:07:18.842
After those reviews...
something new.

01:07:23.641 --> 01:07:24.742
I guess there'll be...

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.875
still a lot of work to do.

01:07:40.907 --> 01:07:41.941
Stop it!

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.542
You've always left me!
You've always left me!

01:08:02.275 --> 01:08:03.209
Emilie!

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.141
I'm sorry. Emilie? Come here.
So...

01:08:08.707 --> 01:08:13.009
Hey. Wake up. Emilie?
Hey...

01:08:14.773 --> 01:08:15.775
Emilie?

01:08:17.874 --> 01:08:18.875
Help!

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.774
Help!

01:08:29.608 --> 01:08:30.942
<i>She doesn't have
much time left.</i>

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.640
<i>But she's not
going to die today.</i>

01:08:37.008 --> 01:08:38.174
The helicopter is ready.

01:08:49.741 --> 01:08:50.742
So you're leaving?

01:08:54.773 --> 01:08:55.941
I just make things worse.

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:03.575
There's something I wanted to
show you before you go.

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:06.774
Just come with me.
They'll wait for you.

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:20.942
Go on in.

01:09:33.808 --> 01:09:35.774
<i>Open... Open the...</i>

01:10:27.308 --> 01:10:29.109
<i>She drowns
in her emotions.</i>

01:10:31.941 --> 01:10:34.142
<i>She's always been like that.</i>

01:10:37.807 --> 01:10:40.272
Dad left and she and Mum
just clung to each other,

01:10:40.274 --> 01:10:41.106
dragged each other down.

01:10:41.108 --> 01:10:43.772
I refuse to live
my life as a victim.

01:10:43.774 --> 01:10:45.276
Your mother died
of a broken heart.

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:49.074
Mum died because of weakness.

01:10:50.773 --> 01:10:53.309
She died because she couldn't
handle life as it is.

01:10:57.908 --> 01:10:59.075
She stopped going to work.

01:11:02.674 --> 01:11:05.641
She wouldn't eat.
She couldn't...

01:11:06.974 --> 01:11:09.305
She couldn't pay the bills. She
couldn't go and buy cigarettes.

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:11.106
So you had to go and do that.

01:11:11.108 --> 01:11:12.808
You had to go out and buy
cigarettes...

01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:16.205
and milk for the money that you
got from social services

01:11:16.207 --> 01:11:18.139
because your mother was no
longer a mother

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:20.942
because your family was no
longer a family.

01:11:23.641 --> 01:11:24.675
She failed.

01:11:39.874 --> 01:11:42.841
Drowning herself in the bath,
putting her head in the oven...

01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:44.942
sleeping pills.
Do you know what?

01:11:45.141 --> 01:11:47.942
When she actually succeeded,
that was a relief.

01:11:52.773 --> 01:11:53.807
Yes.

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.307
That's how it was when Mum died.

01:12:02.275 --> 01:12:03.276
A relief.

01:14:34.341 --> 01:14:36.109
- Come here, come here.
- No, no...

01:14:36.674 --> 01:14:39.575
Come here,
come here. Shh.

01:14:43.008 --> 01:14:44.075
Shh.

01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:00.075
It's okay.

01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:03.308
Shh.

01:15:10.274 --> 01:15:11.807
I miss my Mum.

01:15:19.373 --> 01:15:21.009
I miss her so much.

01:16:27.908 --> 01:16:29.909
Do you remember
that summer in the house?

01:16:36.306 --> 01:16:38.040
That house out on the islands.

01:16:46.073 --> 01:16:47.642
Mum borrowed it from someone.

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.541
- Do you remember?
- It was so hot.

01:17:12.006 --> 01:17:13.607
You taught me to swim.

01:17:16.274 --> 01:17:18.708
That was the summer
before Dad left.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.107
There was a piano upstairs.

01:17:28.307 --> 01:17:30.275
And Dad used to sit and play.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.674
The window was open.

01:17:36.074 --> 01:17:37.307
All night, yeah.

01:17:41.106 --> 01:17:42.207
It was so hot.

01:17:55.074 --> 01:17:56.173
I was happy then.

01:18:05.974 --> 01:18:07.675
<i>Everybody
was happy that summer.</i>

01:18:20.374 --> 01:18:22.674
<i>You used to braid my hair
in the morning.</i>

01:18:28.939 --> 01:18:30.805
<i>There was
a kiosk we used to walk to,</i>

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:31.940
<i>to buy ice cream.</i>

01:18:33.973 --> 01:18:34.973
<i>Remember?</i>

01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:41.742
<i>We were bare foot.</i>

01:18:45.841 --> 01:18:47.308
<i>Sometimes
we passed a tractor.</i>

01:18:54.039 --> 01:18:55.140
<i>I held your hand.</i>

01:18:58.673 --> 01:19:00.941
You held it tight like Mum
said you should.

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.807
You held my hand.

01:20:50.173 --> 01:20:51.174
<i>Emilie Thompson?</i>

01:20:52.273 --> 01:20:54.542
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Please.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.774
I hereby ask you,
Emilie Thompson,

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.575
if you are absolutely certain,

01:22:05.341 --> 01:22:07.241
answering of your own free will

01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:09.608
that you wish to leave?

01:22:11.341 --> 01:22:12.542
Yes.

01:22:18.007 --> 01:22:19.741
As you know,
it tastes bitter.

01:22:20.872 --> 01:22:22.040
After you drink it,

01:22:22.607 --> 01:22:24.773
I will offer you a sweet
to take away the taste.

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:28.707
Then, a few seconds later,
you will fall asleep.

01:22:29.608 --> 01:22:32.941
And, in a few minutes,
your breathing will cease.

01:22:35.074 --> 01:22:37.007
Are you sure
this is what you want?

01:22:39.706 --> 01:22:40.642
Yes.

01:27:42.807 --> 01:27:43.807
I have something for you.

01:28:02.074 --> 01:28:04.974
Tell me. What are you going do
with your material?

01:28:09.107 --> 01:28:09.971
What do you mean?

01:28:09.973 --> 01:28:12.274
The images you took here.
The films.

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:15.841
Are you going to use
them in your work?

01:28:19.107 --> 01:28:20.108
I don't know.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:24.541
Be honest with yourself,
that's all.

01:28:54.273 --> 01:28:55.275
Off you go now.

01:28:58.839 --> 01:28:59.841
Go on.

01:29:28.773 --> 01:29:29.841
Thank you so much.
