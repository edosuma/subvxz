NARRATOR:

00:01.084 --> 00:02.336
All right, Jane and Michael.

00:02.336 --> 00:03.838
<i>They'd been through a lot,</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:03.838
<i>right?</i>

00:03.838 --> 00:05.714
<i>They got married, he was shot,</i>

00:05.714 --> 00:06.966
<i>then recovered.</i>

00:06.966 --> 00:08.342
<i>But things were</i>

00:06.966 --> 00:08.342
<i>on the up-and-up,</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:09.468
<i>until...</i>

00:09.468 --> 00:10.719
I didn't pass my physical.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.929
I can't go back

00:10.719 --> 00:11.929
to the force.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.221
I can do desk duty.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.641
NARRATOR:

00:13.221 --> 00:15.641
<i>I know, huge bummer, right?</i>

00:15.641 --> 00:18.018
<i>Also a bummer: Rafael's life.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:19.269
RAFAEL:

00:18.018 --> 00:19.269
My birth certificate.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.562
I'm not a Solano.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.481
NARRATOR:

00:20.562 --> 00:22.481
<i>And speaking of bad news,</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:24.984
<i>Rafael was also hooking up</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:24.984
<i>with Jane's cousin, Catalina,</i>

00:24.984 --> 00:26.861
<i>and Jane wasn't too comfortable</i>

00:24.984 --> 00:26.861
<i>with that.</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:28.153
JANE:

00:26.861 --> 00:28.153
<i>I saw cash and jewels.</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:29.947
<i>I mean, that's suspicious,</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:29.947
<i>right?</i>

00:29.947 --> 00:32.240
Not when you've just reentered

00:29.947 --> 00:32.240
the States from Venezuela,

00:32.240 --> 00:34.576
where it's recommended

00:32.240 --> 00:34.576
nonresidents carry U.S. dollars.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.411
I am so, so sorry.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.830
NARRATOR:

00:36.411 --> 00:37.830
<i>But maybe Jane was right</i>

00:37.830 --> 00:39.665
<i>to be worried,</i>

00:37.830 --> 00:39.665
<i>because check this out.</i>

00:39.665 --> 00:41.124
<i>And there was more bad news.</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:42.751
<i>Petra was being blackmailed</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:45.295
<i>by a certain sleeveless</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:45.295
<i>slime ball, namely Scott.</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:47.214
<i>So she struck up a deal</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:47.214
<i>with Rafael.</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.507
I'll give you

00:47.214 --> 00:48.507
your shares back

00:48.507 --> 00:49.550
if you lie

00:48.507 --> 00:49.550
about Scott.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.050
NARRATOR:

00:49.550 --> 00:51.050
<i>To be clear,</i>

00:51.050 --> 00:52.636
<i>Petra hated Scott,</i>

00:51.050 --> 00:52.636
<i>for obvious reasons.</i>

00:52.636 --> 00:54.095
( record scratches )

00:52.636 --> 00:54.095
<i>Oh, sorry,</i>

00:54.095 --> 00:55.764
<i>in case you've forgotten</i>

00:54.095 --> 00:55.764
<i>those reasons,</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:57.391
<i>a recap within the recap.</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:59.351
<i>Petra was paralyzed</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:59.351
<i>by her twin sister, Anezka,</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:00.811
<i>who then took her place.</i>

01:00.811 --> 01:02.563
<i>And then,</i>

01:00.811 --> 01:02.563
<i>Anezka fell in love with Scott,</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:03.856
<i>as Petra!</i>

01:03.856 --> 01:04.940
<i>But then Petra woke up</i>

01:04.940 --> 01:06.066
<i>and dumped his ass.</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:08.109
<i>Okay, back to the main recap.</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:10.362
<i>Anyway, that's why</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:10.362
<i>Petra hated Scott.</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:13.156
<i>Oh, and Jane's father, Rogelio,</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:13.156
<i>had met a matchmaker.</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:14.867
So, it says you want

01:13.156 --> 01:14.867
someone fertile?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.867
Exactly.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.827
NARRATOR:

01:14.867 --> 01:16.827
<i>And surprisingly,</i>

01:14.867 --> 01:16.827
<i>this happened.</i>

01:16.827 --> 01:18.078
Rogelio, it's me.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.705
Not to date, just

01:18.078 --> 01:19.705
to have a baby with.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.748
Think about it.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.499
I'm having a baby!

01:22.499 --> 01:24.459
NARRATOR:

01:22.499 --> 01:24.459
<i>And Jane's mom</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:24.459
<i>was getting some action, too.</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:26.127
<i>See, she was back with Bruce.</i>

01:26.127 --> 01:29.423
<i>Yes, that Bruce.</i>

01:26.127 --> 01:29.423
<i>From way back when.</i>

01:29.423 --> 01:32.593
I had sex with Bruce

01:29.423 --> 01:32.593
three days ago.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.593
What?

01:32.593 --> 01:35.303
NARRATOR:

01:32.593 --> 01:35.303
<i>And yep,</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:35.303
<i>Jane's still not a fan.</i>

01:35.303 --> 01:36.430
He's a jerk,

01:36.430 --> 01:37.806
who broke your heart

01:36.430 --> 01:37.806
over and over,

01:37.806 --> 01:39.307
not to mention

01:37.806 --> 01:39.307
he's a liar

01:39.307 --> 01:41.100
who hid the fact that

01:39.307 --> 01:41.100
he was married from you.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.143
I knew he was married

01:42.143 --> 01:43.228
when we got together.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.271
Great.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.439
NARRATOR:

01:44.271 --> 01:45.439
<i>Which, friends,</i>

01:45.439 --> 01:46.774
<i>is where we left off.</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:50.611
<i>A little bit of trivia</i>

01:50.611 --> 01:52.487
<i>about Jane Gloriana Villanueva:</i>

01:52.487 --> 01:54.114
<i>She had seen the movie</i> Beaches

01:54.114 --> 01:56.241
<i>14 times.</i>

01:56.241 --> 01:57.701
<i>Once...</i>

01:57.701 --> 01:59.787
<i>every time her mother</i>

01:57.701 --> 01:59.787
<i>broke up with Bruce.</i>

01:59.787 --> 02:01.789
Thanks for watching

01:59.787 --> 02:01.789
again.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.582
It just helps me, you know?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.500
To cry about something

02:03.582 --> 02:05.500
other than him.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.669
I know, Mom. I know.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.588
NARRATOR:

02:07.669 --> 02:09.588
<i>And that time with her mom,</i>

02:09.588 --> 02:11.256
<i>well, it taught her two things.</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:14.760
<i>She was the wind</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:14.760
<i>beneath Xo's wings.</i>

02:14.760 --> 02:16.344
I just thought

02:14.760 --> 02:16.344
this time,

02:16.344 --> 02:17.888
it would

02:16.344 --> 02:17.888
be different.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.598
NARRATOR:

02:17.888 --> 02:19.598
<i>And people don't change.</i>

02:19.598 --> 02:23.018
<i>Which brings us here, now.</i>

02:23.018 --> 02:24.937
So, thank you for inviting

02:23.018 --> 02:24.937
me over for breakfast.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.564
Thank you for bringing muffins.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.564
They were delicious.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.983
You are.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.859
( sighs )

02:35.948 --> 02:36.865
Hey,

02:36.865 --> 02:37.950
Jane.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.950
Hey.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.119
Hi, Mom. Bruce.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.121
I'll see you later.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.086
Can you at least

02:46.667 --> 02:49.086
not make that face?

02:49.086 --> 02:50.838
I'm sorry,

02:49.086 --> 02:50.838
it just happens automatically.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.380
Maybe warn me before

02:50.838 --> 02:52.380
I'm gonna see him.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.800
I live here, we're dating,

02:52.380 --> 02:54.800
you're gonna see him.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.468
Does Abuela know

02:54.800 --> 02:56.468
that he was here?

02:56.468 --> 02:58.720
We all had breakfast.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.720
He brought muffins.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.640
( speaks Spanish):

02:58.720 --> 03:01.640
Oh, good,

02:58.720 --> 03:01.640
ready for church?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.642
( speaks English ):

03:01.640 --> 03:03.642
You ate breakfast with Bruce?

03:03.642 --> 03:06.478
( speaks Spanish):

03:03.642 --> 03:06.478
Well, he's divorced now.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.856
And I said

03:06.478 --> 03:08.856
I'd give him a chance.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.025
( speaks English ):Why?

03:08.856 --> 03:11.025
Because he's changed, Jane.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.734
Mom, do you hear yourself?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.402
I mean, you have literally

03:12.734 --> 03:14.402
said that to me

03:14.402 --> 03:15.863
a hundred times before.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
I know, but this time

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
it's different.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.282
And that.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.282
Enough.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.784
I'm with him.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.786
So it's time for you

03:20.784 --> 03:22.786
to get on board.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.289
Fine, I'm on board.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.501
I am!

03:29.501 --> 03:31.670
See?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.890
( keys clacking )

03:44.307 --> 03:45.767
ROGELIO:

03:44.307 --> 03:45.767
<i>Yes, I want your opinion.</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:47.310
( goofy voice ):

03:45.767 --> 03:47.310
Okay, Rogelio.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.770
Mr. Bee thinks

03:48.770 --> 03:50.814
having a baby with

03:48.770 --> 03:50.814
a woman you just met

03:50.814 --> 03:53.901
is craz-z-zy!

03:53.901 --> 03:55.360
( laughs )

03:55.360 --> 03:57.905
Well, Mr. Bee,

03:55.360 --> 03:57.905
I respectfully disagree.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.990
NARRATOR:

03:57.905 --> 03:59.990
<i>Ah, yes. You'll recall,</i>

03:59.990 --> 04:02.242
<i>Rogelio had recently decided</i>

03:59.990 --> 04:02.242
<i>to enter into</i>

04:02.242 --> 04:04.828
<i>an unusual business arrangement</i>

04:02.242 --> 04:04.828
<i>with this woman.</i>

04:04.828 --> 04:06.955
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )

04:11.752 --> 04:13.294
You see,

04:11.752 --> 04:13.294
my striped friend,

04:13.294 --> 04:15.923
this is the perfect solution

04:13.294 --> 04:15.923
to my "progeneeds."

04:16.965 --> 04:19.426
Well I think

04:16.965 --> 04:19.426
you're progenuts!

04:19.426 --> 04:20.802
( laughs )

04:19.426 --> 04:20.802
( door opens )

04:20.802 --> 04:22.137
( door closes )

04:22.137 --> 04:24.056
( groans ) I cannot

04:22.137 --> 04:24.056
believe she is back

04:24.056 --> 04:25.140
together with Bruce.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.975
And now my grandma's

04:25.140 --> 04:26.975
brainwashed.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.227
I think we should

04:26.975 --> 04:28.227
do something,

04:28.227 --> 04:29.477
like stage an

04:28.227 --> 04:29.477
intervention.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.021
Oh, no. I'm staying out of it.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.397
MICHAEL:

04:31.021 --> 04:32.397
Yeah, I'm with Rogelio.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.899
What do you think, Mr. Bee?

04:33.899 --> 04:35.859
( goofy voice ):

04:33.899 --> 04:35.859
You mean Mr. Let It Bee?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.028
I think Jane shouldn't meddle.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.488
You don't get a medal

04:38.028 --> 04:40.488
for meddling.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.657
Nobody likes a meddler!

04:40.488 --> 04:42.657
Don't you have to be at work?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.993
( normal voice ):

04:42.657 --> 04:44.993
I get to go to

04:42.657 --> 04:44.993
the body shop first.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.453
$500 bucks for a new bumper.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.413
Oh, no, seriously?

04:46.453 --> 04:48.413
Yeah.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.207
But, it beats sitting

04:48.413 --> 04:50.207
around the office.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.875
NARRATOR:

04:50.207 --> 04:51.875
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

04:51.875 --> 04:53.376
<i>He's on desk duty,</i>

04:51.875 --> 04:53.376
<i>you'll recall.</i>

04:53.376 --> 04:55.462
( goofy voice ):

04:53.376 --> 04:55.462
Desk duty sucks.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.630
( giggles )

04:56.630 --> 04:58.006
Maybe you should use the time

04:58.006 --> 05:00.550
to start researching

04:58.006 --> 05:00.550
other career options.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.219
I'm serious. If you take

05:00.550 --> 05:02.219
some kind of action,

05:02.219 --> 05:04.221
I really think

05:02.219 --> 05:04.221
you'll feel better.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.014
Mm.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.014
( gasps )

05:06.014 --> 05:07.057
I'd help you, Michael.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.183
Aw.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.559
But I can't

05:08.183 --> 05:09.559
use a computer,

05:09.559 --> 05:12.229
'cause I don't have

05:09.559 --> 05:12.229
any fingers! Whoa!

05:12.229 --> 05:13.480
( laughs )

05:13.480 --> 05:14.731
I'm gonna hide that thing.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.108
All right,

05:16.108 --> 05:18.777
are you ready to see Daddy,

05:16.108 --> 05:18.777
Mr. Sweetface?

05:18.777 --> 05:20.779
Yes, you want to see Daddy.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.239
( knocking )

05:23.364 --> 05:25.533
Where is Daddy, Mr. Sweetface?

05:28.203 --> 05:29.496

NARRATOR:

05:34.001 --> 05:35.252
<i>In his defense,</i>

05:35.252 --> 05:36.670
<i>he's had a lot on his mind.</i>

05:40.799 --> 05:42.550
What do you think, Mateo?

05:42.550 --> 05:44.636
Should we pop by and see

05:42.550 --> 05:44.636
how Auntie Catalina's doing?

05:44.636 --> 05:46.013
Hmm?

05:44.636 --> 05:46.013
NARRATOR:<i> Ah, yes.</i>

05:46.013 --> 05:47.306
<i>Catalina.</i>

05:47.306 --> 05:49.141
Oh.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.349
Jane.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.896
( sighs )

05:53.020 --> 05:54.896
We had some time to kill,

05:54.896 --> 05:56.190
so we wanted to say hi.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.482
And,

05:57.482 --> 05:58.692
apologize, again.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.235
For snooping through your bag

06:00.235 --> 06:02.403
and thinking that

06:00.235 --> 06:02.403
you were hiding something.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.446
Bonjour!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.115
Who are you?

06:05.115 --> 06:07.408
I am Catalina's husband, Arnaud.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.788
( trumpet plays )

06:14.291 --> 06:15.500
You're married?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.502
He's being

06:15.500 --> 06:17.502
a little dramatic.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.712
Dramatic?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.130
I am not being

06:18.712 --> 06:20.130
dramatic!

06:20.130 --> 06:21.340
We're getting divorced.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.799
We are not.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.176
CATALINA:

06:22.799 --> 06:24.176
Yes, we are!

06:24.176 --> 06:25.802
Now for the last time,

06:24.176 --> 06:25.802
go pack.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.637
I'm taking you

06:25.802 --> 06:27.637
to the airport.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.144
So I should explain.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.144
Uh, yeah,

06:31.975 --> 06:34.144
that'd be a good idea.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.395
I married Arnaud on

06:34.144 --> 06:36.395
a passionate whim

06:36.395 --> 06:37.981
a few months ago.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.774
NARRATOR:

06:37.981 --> 06:39.774
<i>That old guy? Come on,</i>

06:39.774 --> 06:40.901
<i>it had to be about money.</i>

06:40.901 --> 06:42.569
It was wild

06:40.901 --> 06:42.569
and romantic,

06:42.569 --> 06:44.154
and not

06:42.569 --> 06:44.154
about money.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.822
He has a title,

06:44.154 --> 06:45.822
but not a penny to his name.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.781
Okay, get to the point.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.158
Right. Everyone

06:46.781 --> 06:48.158
told me

06:48.158 --> 06:49.659
not to marry him,

06:48.158 --> 06:49.659
but I did it anyway

06:49.659 --> 06:51.619
and, well, it turns out

06:49.659 --> 06:51.619
everyone was right.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.871
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

06:52.871 --> 06:54.206
Because it was

06:52.871 --> 06:54.206
embarrassing.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.207
ARNAUD:

06:54.206 --> 06:55.207
I can hear you!

06:55.207 --> 06:56.291
Well then stop

06:55.207 --> 06:56.291
listening!

06:56.291 --> 06:57.918
Anyway, we

06:56.291 --> 06:57.918
had just met

06:57.918 --> 06:59.586
and I didn't want you

06:57.918 --> 06:59.586
to think poorly of me.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.296
NARRATOR:

06:59.586 --> 07:01.296
<i>Yeah, that yacht has sailed.</i>

07:01.296 --> 07:03.257
What about all the cash

07:01.296 --> 07:03.257
and jewelry?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.342
Is that really for

07:03.257 --> 07:05.342
our poor relatives in Venezuela?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.676
Mostly, yeah.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.345
I mean, a few are

07:06.676 --> 07:08.345
gifts from Arnaud,

07:08.345 --> 07:09.971
which I wanted to sell,

07:08.345 --> 07:09.971
but he wants back,

07:09.971 --> 07:11.431
so fine, I'll

07:09.971 --> 07:11.431
give them back.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.557
Did you hear that?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.683
I'll give them back!

07:13.683 --> 07:14.893
NARRATOR:

07:13.683 --> 07:14.893
<i>It should be noted</i>

07:14.893 --> 07:16.228
<i>that Jane's next thought</i>

07:16.228 --> 07:17.604
<i>was that she needed</i>

07:16.228 --> 07:17.604
<i>to tell Rafael!</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:19.314
<i>Right away.</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:19.314
( buzzing )

07:19.314 --> 07:21.900
Remember, Jane,

07:19.314 --> 07:21.900
don't meddle!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.820
You need to tell Rafael.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.820
Right away.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.407
Just tell me.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.367
( sighs )

07:30.367 --> 07:34.204
The DNA results came in

07:30.367 --> 07:34.204
and it's confirmed.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.124
You are not Emilio and Elena's

07:34.204 --> 07:37.124
biological son.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.297
Wow.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.631
( scoffs )

07:46.007 --> 07:48.468
Somehow it didn't

07:46.007 --> 07:48.468
seem real until now.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.761
NARRATOR:

07:48.468 --> 07:49.761
<i>What does this mean?</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:51.346
<i>Is he still Emilio's heir?</i>

07:51.346 --> 07:52.931
<i>Does he still own the Marbella?</i>

07:52.931 --> 07:55.683
God, I wonder if

07:52.931 --> 07:55.683
my dad knew.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.477
And that's why he always

07:55.683 --> 07:57.477
treated me differently.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.062
NARRATOR:

07:57.477 --> 07:59.062
<i>Right. That, too.</i>

07:59.062 --> 08:00.563
I'm sorry.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.274
And just so

08:00.563 --> 08:02.274
you know,

08:02.274 --> 08:03.691
you're under no legal obligation

08:03.691 --> 08:05.526
to disclose that information

08:03.691 --> 08:05.526
to anybody.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.404
Sorry to interrupt, but Rafael,

08:07.404 --> 08:09.614
we're actually waiting on you

08:07.404 --> 08:09.614
in the interrogation room.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.825
Oh, that's where everyone

08:09.614 --> 08:11.825
is. Okay, let's head over.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.618
Uh, sorry, man.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.454
Because of the desk duty,

08:13.618 --> 08:15.454
you know.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.622
Chief says you can't be

08:15.454 --> 08:17.622
in on this anymore.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.207
I get it.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.335
I'm really...

08:19.207 --> 08:21.335
It's okay.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.378
(<i> sad theme playing</i> )

08:27.174 --> 08:28.883
NARRATOR:

08:27.174 --> 08:28.883
<i>Wow. Tough day.</i>

08:28.883 --> 08:30.218
PETRA:

08:28.883 --> 08:30.218
What are you up to?!

08:30.218 --> 08:31.970
NARRATOR:

08:30.218 --> 08:31.970
<i>And it just got worse.</i>

08:31.970 --> 08:33.221
You and Scott.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.432
Are you-- are you working

08:33.221 --> 08:35.432
together?

08:35.432 --> 08:36.724
Manipulating me?

08:36.724 --> 08:38.268
NARRATOR:

08:36.724 --> 08:38.268
<i>I'll remind you, they were.</i>

08:38.268 --> 08:40.187
I told you it would

08:38.268 --> 08:40.187
work. And you will be

08:40.187 --> 08:41.604
getting that bonus

08:40.187 --> 08:41.604
as discussed.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.023
Of course not.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.774
He bought a new car.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.774
Where'd he get that money?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.109
I saw you two talking!

08:46.109 --> 08:47.527
NARRATOR:

08:46.109 --> 08:47.527
<i>And friends,</i>

08:47.527 --> 08:48.778
<i>can you really blame Rafael</i>

08:48.778 --> 08:50.113
<i>for what he said next?</i>

08:50.113 --> 08:51.823
Petra.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.658
I think you're being

08:51.823 --> 08:53.658
a little paranoid.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.951
Which makes sense,

08:54.951 --> 08:56.703
considering what you

08:54.951 --> 08:56.703
just went through.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.998
( laughs )

09:03.918 --> 09:05.003
NARRATOR:

09:03.918 --> 09:05.003
<i>Well, I can.</i>

09:05.003 --> 09:06.505
<i>That was a low blow.</i>

09:06.505 --> 09:08.298
JANE:

09:06.505 --> 09:08.298
<i>You're never gonna</i>

09:06.505 --> 09:08.298
<i>believe this!</i>

09:08.298 --> 09:10.550
I was dropping Mateo off

09:08.298 --> 09:10.550
and so we stopped by

09:10.550 --> 09:13.345
to visit Catalina and

09:10.550 --> 09:13.345
turns out, she's married.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.723
What's wrong?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.975
Did things go badly

09:16.723 --> 09:18.975
with Rafael, because...

09:18.975 --> 09:21.602
No, no, no.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.602
It's, uh...

09:21.602 --> 09:24.398
it's not Rafael.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.398
I, um...

09:26.066 --> 09:28.527
I sort of--

09:26.066 --> 09:28.527
I quit my job today.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.987
NARRATOR:

09:28.527 --> 09:30.987
<i>Well, she wanted him</i>

09:28.527 --> 09:30.987
<i>to take an action.</i>

09:35.492 --> 09:38.537
I'm sorry for not talking

09:35.492 --> 09:38.537
to you about it first.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.414
It just...

09:40.414 --> 09:42.541
I'm not even allowed

09:40.414 --> 09:42.541
to be involved on cases

09:42.541 --> 09:43.958
I've staked my entire career on.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.377
And then some rookie

09:45.377 --> 09:46.753
gave me a 20-minute lecture

09:46.753 --> 09:48.547
on the proper way

09:46.753 --> 09:48.547
to fill out evidence log forms

09:48.547 --> 09:50.131
and I don't know,

09:48.547 --> 09:50.131
I-I quit.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.508
And then I panicked,

09:50.131 --> 09:51.508
'cause I knew

09:51.508 --> 09:52.800
I should have

09:51.508 --> 09:52.800
talked to you first.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.303
No. I get it.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.513
You do?

09:56.513 --> 09:57.972
Yes, of course.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.475
Oh, I don't want you

09:57.972 --> 10:00.475
to be miserable.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.935
( sighs )

10:04.687 --> 10:06.689
Armstrong gave me

10:04.687 --> 10:06.689
a six-month severance package,

10:06.689 --> 10:09.150
so, it gives me some time

10:06.689 --> 10:09.150
to figure out my next move.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.985
Okay, six

10:09.150 --> 10:10.985
months is good.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.738
I think it was

10:12.028 --> 10:13.738
the right move.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.784
NARRATOR:

10:16.074 --> 10:17.784
<i>Aw.</i>

10:17.784 --> 10:20.328
<i>She doesn't even look nervous.</i>

10:20.328 --> 10:22.622
<i>Oh. Now she does.</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:25.459
<i>Those must be "I'm sorry</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:25.459
<i>I was judgy about Bruce,</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:27.835
<i>but Michael quit his job"</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:27.835
<i>coffees.</i>

10:27.835 --> 10:30.797
<i>Eh, you should see</i>

10:27.835 --> 10:30.797
<i>how they butcher my name.</i>

10:30.797 --> 10:32.215
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

10:32.215 --> 10:34.175
<i>Maybe Jean and Zoe</i>

10:34.175 --> 10:35.718
<i>have something else to discuss.</i>

10:35.718 --> 10:37.262
( sighs )

10:44.519 --> 10:45.686
What happened?

10:45.686 --> 10:47.021
Nothing. I'm fine.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.815
Ma...

10:47.021 --> 10:48.815
I don't want

10:47.021 --> 10:48.815
to discuss it with you.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.609
You can't be objective

10:48.815 --> 10:50.609
when it comes to Bruce.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.487
Okay. I get it.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.824
( footsteps departing )

11:00.285 --> 11:02.162
Is she okay?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.746
( buzzing )

11:03.746 --> 11:07.959
Remember, Jane. You don't

11:03.746 --> 11:07.959
get a medal for meddling.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.586
Yeah. She's great.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.586
Thanks, Bruce.

11:09.586 --> 11:13.047
Jane, please.

11:09.586 --> 11:13.047
Why won't you

11:09.586 --> 11:13.047
just leave her alone?

11:13.047 --> 11:14.466
( gasps )

11:14.466 --> 11:16.217
Because I care about her.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.219
Oh, yeah? Is that why

11:16.217 --> 11:18.219
she's in there, crying?

11:18.219 --> 11:20.847
Again? Just like she did

11:18.219 --> 11:20.847
for three years straight.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.974
And do you know who had

11:20.847 --> 11:22.974
to stand by her and pick up

11:22.974 --> 11:24.309
the pieces every time?

11:24.309 --> 11:26.727
Me.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.438
So I'm sorry.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.607
I-I just... I can't be on board.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.900
ROGELIO:

11:30.607 --> 11:32.900
<i>I told you,</i>

11:30.607 --> 11:32.900
<i>it wouldn't be contentious.</i>

11:32.900 --> 11:35.236
Yes, great, you were right,

11:32.900 --> 11:35.236
and I was wrong.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.988
Let's finish up. Schooling.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.281
Private or public?

11:38.281 --> 11:40.158
Private.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.158
And nannies?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.742
The more the merrier.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.495
Vacations?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.495
Summers in Tulum.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.954
Winters in Aspen.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.331
How about media appearances?

11:46.331 --> 11:47.874
<i>Vanity Fair</i> at three months,

11:47.874 --> 11:49.501
<i>People en Español</i>

11:47.874 --> 11:49.501
at six months,

11:49.501 --> 11:52.003
and<i> Us Weekly</i> cover shoot

11:49.501 --> 11:52.003
at a year.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.130
Have you settled on a last name?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.965
Hmm.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.965
( gasps )

11:55.965 --> 11:58.343
De La Vega Factor?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.345
The De La Vega Factor.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.846
I like it.

12:01.846 --> 12:05.058
Very good. Just, uh,

12:01.846 --> 12:05.058
one final matter.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.228
Procedure. Will you be having

12:05.058 --> 12:08.228
sex or using insemination?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.312
Insemination.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.564
I'm worried Darci will fall

12:10.564 --> 12:12.023
for me if we make love.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.483
And it's important for us both

12:13.483 --> 12:15.068
not to have feelings

12:13.483 --> 12:15.068
for each other,

12:15.068 --> 12:16.152
to make this work.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.320
I totally agree.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.655
Plus, I froze my eggs years ago.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.365
I want to use the youngest ones.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.866
Isn't she the best?

12:21.866 --> 12:24.369
Relentlessly practical.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.786
( chuckles )

12:24.369 --> 12:25.786
Okay, great.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.788
I will have copies

12:25.786 --> 12:27.788
of the agreement

12:27.788 --> 12:29.666
for you both to sign

12:27.788 --> 12:29.666
in the next couple of days.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.751
ROGELIO:

12:29.666 --> 12:32.751
<i>It's happening, people.</i>

12:32.751 --> 12:34.128
The negotiations are done.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.630
All we have to do

12:34.128 --> 12:35.630
is sign the contracts,

12:35.630 --> 12:39.217
and in nine months,

12:35.630 --> 12:39.217
out comes Rogelio Jr.,

12:39.217 --> 12:42.929
or Rogeliana.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.098
( speaks Spanish):

12:42.929 --> 12:45.098
She likes Rogeliana?

12:45.098 --> 12:48.059
( speaks English ):

12:45.098 --> 12:48.059
Well, no, that's the only thing

12:45.098 --> 12:48.059
she hasn't agreed to.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.437
Yet.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.437
( laughs )

12:50.437 --> 12:52.146
What is it?

12:52.146 --> 12:53.772
I-I just can't believe

12:52.146 --> 12:53.772
you're actually

12:53.772 --> 12:55.400
going through with this.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.400
What do you mean?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.859
I've been talking

12:55.400 --> 12:56.859
about it for weeks.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.070
Yeah, well, you always

12:56.859 --> 12:59.070
have crazy ideas

12:59.070 --> 13:00.614
but you never

12:59.070 --> 13:00.614
actually follow through.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.365
What are you talking about?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.158
We need to bond as a family.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.244
One year.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.244
A trip around the world!

13:07.537 --> 13:09.748
I am all about Kaballah.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.791
Here, I got you all red strings.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.377
From now on,

13:14.377 --> 13:16.003
you can call me Yahweh.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.924
I'm thinking

13:17.838 --> 13:19.924
of growing a man bun.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.552
It's a terrible idea.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.512
The man bun?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.512
Because I'm still debating.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.931
No! The baby.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.931
You hardly know her.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.267
We agreed on absolutely

13:26.931 --> 13:29.267
everything about child rearing.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.519
Plus, you know how much

13:29.267 --> 13:31.519
I want another child.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.355
( speaks Spanish ):

13:31.519 --> 13:34.355
It's just hard to get excited,

13:34.355 --> 13:36.023
because we've never met Darci.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.151
( speaks Spanish ):

13:36.023 --> 13:38.151
Mm. You're right, Alba.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.612
( speaks English ):

13:38.151 --> 13:40.612
I would very much like

13:38.151 --> 13:40.612
to introduce you.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.155
Trust me,

13:40.612 --> 13:42.155
to know her

13:42.155 --> 13:44.991
is to love her

13:42.155 --> 13:44.991
in a totally non-emotional,

13:44.991 --> 13:46.534
nonsexual way.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.911
RAFAEL:

13:46.534 --> 13:48.911
<i>I don't understand.</i>

13:48.911 --> 13:51.372
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

13:48.911 --> 13:51.372
I'm divorced.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.291
I mean, we've talked

13:51.372 --> 13:53.291
about my divorce.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.751
I know. And I can't

13:53.291 --> 13:54.751
really explain it,

13:54.751 --> 13:57.003
except that I'd made

13:54.751 --> 13:57.003
such a huge mistake,

13:57.003 --> 13:59.464
and it felt so good

13:57.003 --> 13:59.464
not to think about it

13:59.464 --> 14:02.801
or talk about it. Finally.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.761
Plus, I have a habit

14:02.801 --> 14:04.761
of running from problems

14:04.761 --> 14:06.554
rather than dealing with them.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.559
Well. I can relate to that.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.520
Darling,

14:13.520 --> 14:16.773
I wasn't looking for anything

14:13.520 --> 14:16.773
when I met you.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.276
This... this just happened.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.153
And is it over?

14:22.153 --> 14:23.780
With the old guy?

14:23.780 --> 14:25.990
Oh, don't call him that.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.990
I googled him. He's old.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.034
I said it was a mistake.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.034
Is it over?

14:28.034 --> 14:31.162
Absolutely. Ask Jane. She heard

14:28.034 --> 14:31.162
me tell him to pack up and go.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.789
Jane met him?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.207
JANE:

14:32.789 --> 14:34.207
I'm sorry.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.458
I wasn't sure what to do.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.626
I told her to tell you.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.877
<i>You</i> should have told me.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.338
( sighs )

14:37.877 --> 14:40.338
Yeah. You're right.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.590
How'd you leave things?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.718
Well, she swears it's over

14:42.590 --> 14:44.718
with the old guy.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.846
What do you think?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.846
You trust her?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.849
I'm not sure.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.517
Yeah. Me neither.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.935
Look,

14:52.517 --> 14:54.935
if anything else happens...

14:54.935 --> 14:56.479
Absolutely.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.479
Anything I know, you know.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.272
ANEZKA:

14:56.479 --> 14:58.272
<i>What would you like to know?</i>

15:00.692 --> 15:02.402
Anything at all?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.320
Answers from the beyond,

15:04.320 --> 15:06.614
available here, today.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
Beautiful sister,

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
what are you doing here?

15:10.951 --> 15:13.079
Trust me, it was a last resort.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.205
It's so good to see you.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.998
Oh, one of the

15:14.205 --> 15:15.998
pimps at my motel

15:15.998 --> 15:17.667
was going to let me

15:15.998 --> 15:17.667
use his cell phone

15:17.667 --> 15:19.627
to call you but then he got

15:17.667 --> 15:19.627
knifed in the stairwell

15:19.627 --> 15:21.421
and had to go to hospital

15:19.627 --> 15:21.421
so it didn't work out.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.089
Look, I'm only here

15:21.421 --> 15:23.089
because I need to know.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.841
Has Scott reached out

15:23.089 --> 15:24.841
to you at all?

15:24.841 --> 15:27.468
No. Why? Has he asked about me?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.178
No! I just don't know

15:27.468 --> 15:29.178
if he's up to something.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.723
He has money, suddenly.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.723
That's what I need to know.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.266
I need to know

15:31.723 --> 15:33.266
where is it coming from.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.809
Beautiful sister,

15:34.809 --> 15:36.519
are you okay?

15:36.519 --> 15:39.355
No. No, I-I am not okay.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.902
You paralyzed me.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.902
And now I'm paranoid,

15:43.902 --> 15:46.028
and I can't trust anyone,

15:43.902 --> 15:46.028
not even myself.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.700
I need you to leave.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.786
Yeah. That's...

15:50.700 --> 15:52.786
That's part of the problem.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.537
No! This is my booth.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.081
I had to fight man who sells

15:54.537 --> 15:57.081
dream catchers for it.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.709
No. I meant the United States.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.419
I'll get you a ticket.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.419
You're going back

16:01.419 --> 16:02.921
to the Czech Republic.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.921
No. But...

16:02.921 --> 16:04.422
It's either that

16:02.921 --> 16:04.422
or you're going to jail.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.048
MICHAEL:

16:04.422 --> 16:06.048
<i>I mean, it's highway robbery.</i>

16:06.048 --> 16:07.967
So I went to the car dealership

16:07.967 --> 16:10.762
to see about leasing a new car,

16:07.967 --> 16:10.762
and suddenly, it hit me.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.639
JANE ( on phone ):

16:10.762 --> 16:12.639
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.</i>

16:12.639 --> 16:14.432
You want to be a car salesman?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.768
Come on down

16:14.432 --> 16:16.768
to Seven Star Auto Dealer,

16:16.768 --> 16:19.479
where our prices are<i> insane!</i>

16:21.898 --> 16:23.983
Um... Do you really think

16:21.898 --> 16:23.983
you'd like it?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.235
Well, I mean, uh, enough.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.655
It's a job. Steady pay.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.699
Yeah. Y-You're just

16:28.655 --> 16:31.699
not really a car guy.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.535
I'm a car guy.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.535
What's your favorite car?

16:34.535 --> 16:36.203
Uh... the... the DeLorean.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.122
Okay, I'm not a car guy.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.750
But I might become a car guy.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.750
Just don't rush into anything.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.752
I want you to do something

16:40.750 --> 16:42.752
you're passionate about.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.505
Yeah, well, having sex with you

16:42.752 --> 16:45.505
doesn't pay that well.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
( laughs )

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
Just promise me

16:47.507 --> 16:49.091
you'll wait a beat

16:47.507 --> 16:49.091
before interviewing

16:49.091 --> 16:50.426
at the car dealership.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.426
Maybe try

16:50.426 --> 16:52.052
the aptitude test I gave you.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.013
( knocking on door )

16:52.052 --> 16:54.013
There's someone at the door.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.264
Okay, I'll be home soon.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.224
Love you. Bye.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.477
( knocking continues )

16:59.477 --> 17:02.313
I can't believe

16:59.477 --> 17:02.313
that you yelled at Bruce.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.148
What were

17:02.313 --> 17:04.148
you thinking?

17:04.148 --> 17:07.151
Mom. You're already fighting,

17:04.148 --> 17:07.151
he's already making you cry.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.654
We weren't fighting.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.654
We were talking

17:09.654 --> 17:11.865
about his teenage daughter,

17:09.654 --> 17:11.865
Tess, who hates me.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.700
He said we'd just

17:11.865 --> 17:13.700
keep working on it,

17:13.700 --> 17:16.160
and I just felt sad.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.160
Oh.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.705
Yeah. And he thought that she'd

17:16.160 --> 17:18.705
get past it eventually--

17:18.705 --> 17:20.373
she's only 16, right?

17:20.373 --> 17:23.001
But now, after talking to you,

17:20.373 --> 17:23.001
he's not so sure she will.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.460
Mom. I'm so sorry.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.171
( buzzing )

17:24.460 --> 17:27.171
Mm-mm-mm.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.298
NARRATOR:

17:27.171 --> 17:29.298
<i>If he won't say it, I will.</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:30.800
<i>Nobody likes a meddler.</i>

17:33.511 --> 17:36.014
Hey, did you pick up

17:33.511 --> 17:36.014
the rum cake my mom likes

17:36.014 --> 17:37.598
for dinner tonight?

17:36.014 --> 17:37.598
Yes.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.767
I even had the baker write,

17:37.598 --> 17:39.767
"Sorry I messed things up

17:39.767 --> 17:42.395
with Bruce" in vanilla frosting.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.395
( laughs )

17:42.395 --> 17:43.521
Just kidding.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.648
It's in the fridge.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.648
Thank you.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.776
And career aptitude test

17:45.648 --> 17:48.776
complete and the results are in.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.444
NARRATOR:

17:48.776 --> 17:50.444
<i>Drumroll, please.</i>

17:50.444 --> 17:52.030
Okay.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.240
So it says here I should be...

17:54.240 --> 17:56.784
A detective. Okay.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.078
So that was a big

17:56.784 --> 17:59.078
ol' waste of time.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.747
Hey, at least we know

17:59.078 --> 18:00.747
that it works.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.081
( sighs )

18:00.747 --> 18:02.081
Stop, look.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.876
They give more than

18:02.081 --> 18:04.876
one career option.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.169
Plus, it says

18:04.876 --> 18:07.169
that you're analytic,

18:07.169 --> 18:10.965
fair-minded, result-oriented,

18:07.169 --> 18:10.965
and incredibly sexy.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.634
NARRATOR:

18:10.965 --> 18:13.634
<i>I didn't see "incredibly sexy"</i>

18:10.965 --> 18:13.634
<i>on that list.</i>

18:13.634 --> 18:16.470
Let's see. A P.I.,

18:13.634 --> 18:16.470
security consult... Ooh!

18:16.470 --> 18:18.514
An FBI analyst.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.514
Oh, forget it.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.017
All these jobs are just me

18:18.514 --> 18:21.017
sitting at a desk, wishing

18:21.017 --> 18:23.185
I was in the field, doing

18:21.017 --> 18:23.185
the real investigative work.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
I... I might as well

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
be a car salesman.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.440
As long as it's something

18:25.312 --> 18:27.440
that you're excited about.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.649
I want you to be happy.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.401
You know what would

18:28.649 --> 18:30.401
make me happy?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.401
Hmm?

18:30.401 --> 18:32.361
Not going to this dinner

18:30.401 --> 18:32.361
with your mom and Bruce.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.739
Can I just make a case

18:32.361 --> 18:34.739
as to why I shouldn't go?

18:34.739 --> 18:35.949
I'm listening.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.491
I don't know Bruce. Okay?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.118
I've never met Bruce.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.787
And I'd just be

18:39.118 --> 18:40.787
in the way, taking up

18:40.787 --> 18:43.998
precious Bruce-Jane

18:40.787 --> 18:43.998
bonding time. Okay?

18:43.998 --> 18:46.834
Plus, I really need

18:43.998 --> 18:46.834
to go to the station,

18:46.834 --> 18:49.837
pack up my stuff in the office,

18:46.834 --> 18:49.837
say good-bye to the guys.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.758
And I'm making the super cute,

18:49.837 --> 18:53.758
"Don't make me go

18:53.758 --> 18:55.384
"to the dinner

18:53.758 --> 18:55.384
with your mom's boyfriend

18:55.384 --> 18:57.053
who you yelled at" face.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.723
Ugh, fine. Of course.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.144
NARRATOR:

19:02.182 --> 19:05.144
<i>Which brings us here, now...</i>

19:05.144 --> 19:06.395
Uh, some wine?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.188
Is this safe to drink?

19:08.188 --> 19:09.148
Oh, yeah, I didn't...

19:09.148 --> 19:11.191
He was just making a joke.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.361
Right. ( laughs weakly )

19:14.361 --> 19:16.823
Look, I know

19:14.361 --> 19:16.823
the idea of me dating

19:16.823 --> 19:18.783
your mom again is

19:16.823 --> 19:18.783
a tough pill to swallow.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.410
Yeah, well,

19:19.951 --> 19:21.410
there's history there.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.288
Right. Yeah.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.288
For my daughter, too.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.916
Did she... know,

19:26.916 --> 19:30.086
while you guys were...

19:26.916 --> 19:30.086
having the affair?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.714
Yeah.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.591
I went over there, once.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.301
Bruce!

19:37.301 --> 19:39.261
( kicks door )

19:37.301 --> 19:39.261
Bruce!

19:39.261 --> 19:40.471
Come out here!

19:41.388 --> 19:43.474
We both made bad choices.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.601
When your mom

19:43.474 --> 19:45.601
finally walked away,

19:45.601 --> 19:47.436
it was my wakeup call.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.523
I was so unhappy, I was

19:47.436 --> 19:50.523
making everybody else unhappy.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.150
So I made a change.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.359
And it was hard.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.902
Every step of the way.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.320
How about your ex-wife?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.488
We're good now.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.865
Finally.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.702
But my daughter's

20:00.240 --> 20:02.702
having a hard time,

20:02.702 --> 20:05.329
now that I'm with Xo.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.874
And I would never

20:05.329 --> 20:07.874
put her through this

20:07.874 --> 20:10.584
if I didn't think that your

20:07.874 --> 20:10.584
mom-- and what we have--

20:10.584 --> 20:11.919
is worth it.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.135
Just give your daughter

20:17.299 --> 20:19.135
some time.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.720
I bet she'll come around.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.429
( exhales )

20:33.858 --> 20:36.152
So, thank you for giving Bruce

20:33.858 --> 20:36.152
another chance.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.445
Well, he seems

20:36.152 --> 20:38.445
to really care about you.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.198
Right?

20:40.198 --> 20:42.575
So, can we put another

20:40.198 --> 20:42.575
dinner on the books?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.826
Maybe a double date?

20:43.826 --> 20:45.995
Yeah, sure.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.995
When?

20:45.995 --> 20:47.413
I don't know,

20:45.995 --> 20:47.413
just give me a minute.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.123
What's wrong?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.835
Nothing, I'm tired,

20:50.624 --> 20:52.835
I got to get Mateo.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.003
Jane.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.091
Look, I always saw Bruce

20:55.504 --> 20:58.091
as the guy who wreaked havoc

20:58.091 --> 21:01.468
on our family, but now

20:58.091 --> 21:01.468
you're that person to them.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.054
And... I don't know,

21:03.054 --> 21:04.972
I-I don't like thinking

21:03.054 --> 21:04.972
about you like that.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.350
I'm sorry,

21:06.348 --> 21:08.350
you asked me what was wrong.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.353
No, it's okay, I get it.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.482
Hey, Michael,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.482
I'm done with dinner.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.276
I'm picking up Mateo

21:15.482 --> 21:17.276
and I'll be home soon.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.778
( Catalina laughs )

21:21.114 --> 21:22.531
NARRATOR:

21:21.114 --> 21:22.531
<i>Sacre bleu!</i>

21:22.531 --> 21:25.243
<i>Sorry, I mean, oh, my gosh.</i>

21:25.243 --> 21:28.037
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

21:28.037 --> 21:29.288
( sighs )

21:29.288 --> 21:32.332
So, of course I told Rafael.

21:32.332 --> 21:36.212
He said he was gonna end it,

21:32.332 --> 21:36.212
but I mean, can you believe her?

21:36.212 --> 21:38.172
What? Why are you smiling?

21:36.212 --> 21:38.172
None of this is funny.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.216
I'm sorry, I just

21:38.172 --> 21:40.216
actually had a breakthrough,

21:40.216 --> 21:41.341
something I'd love to try.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.969
Okay? I don't know

21:41.341 --> 21:42.969
if it's a career,

21:42.969 --> 21:44.137
but I'm excited.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.596
Oh, my God, what is it?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.596
Tell me.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.556
Okay, well,

21:45.596 --> 21:47.556
I went down to the station, um,

21:47.556 --> 21:49.225
and Dennis and the guys,

21:47.556 --> 21:49.225
they threw me

21:49.225 --> 21:50.768
a little surprise

21:49.225 --> 21:50.768
going-away party,

21:50.768 --> 21:53.854
and I made a speech,

21:50.768 --> 21:53.854
and I was cracking everybody up.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.439
I mean, seriously

21:53.854 --> 21:55.439
cracking them up.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.649
NARRATOR:

21:55.439 --> 21:56.649
<i>And...</i>

21:56.649 --> 21:58.358
And it made me

21:56.649 --> 21:58.358
realize something.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.485
Maybe I should try

21:59.485 --> 22:02.238
my hand at stand-up comedy.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.282
( laughs )

22:04.282 --> 22:06.408
NARRATOR:

22:04.282 --> 22:06.408
<i>He's not joking, Jane.</i>

22:06.408 --> 22:08.161
Well, that sounds great.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.500
XIOMARA:

22:13.207 --> 22:14.500
A comedian?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.085
( speaks Spanish ):

22:14.500 --> 22:16.085
Like Jerry Seinfeld?

22:16.085 --> 22:18.378
NARRATOR:

22:16.085 --> 22:18.378
<i>No, Alba.</i>

22:16.085 --> 22:18.378
<i>Not like Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

22:18.378 --> 22:21.966
( speaks English ):

22:18.378 --> 22:21.966
I mean, kind of,

22:18.378 --> 22:21.966
but kind of... not?

22:21.966 --> 22:25.052
Has he been telling

22:21.966 --> 22:25.052
you his jokes?

22:21.966 --> 22:25.052
Yeah. Nonstop.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.596
Okay, check this out. This is

22:25.052 --> 22:27.596
something I've been working on.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.183
Inspired by...

22:27.596 --> 22:30.183
( imitates actor ): Jim Carrey.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.642
And then for the next 11 minutes

22:31.642 --> 22:32.810
he talked out of his butt.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.187
Oh.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.147
( speaks Spanish ):

22:34.187 --> 22:36.147
Michael is very funny.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.982
NARRATOR:

22:36.147 --> 22:37.982
<i>Yeah, not the Jim Carrey bit.</i>

22:37.982 --> 22:39.900
( speaks English ):

22:37.982 --> 22:39.900
I agree,

22:37.982 --> 22:39.900
Michael is hilarious,

22:39.900 --> 22:41.235
but do you know

22:39.900 --> 22:41.235
what the odds are

22:41.235 --> 22:42.695
of becoming

22:41.235 --> 22:42.695
a successful comedian?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.404
Well, you're an

22:42.695 --> 22:44.404
aspiring novelist.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.364
That's not exactly

22:44.404 --> 22:46.364
a straightforward career path.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.909
I know, I agree,

22:46.364 --> 22:48.909
and I'm trying to support him.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.829
And you guys will

22:48.909 --> 22:51.829
have a chance, too.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.372
He signed up to perform

22:51.829 --> 22:54.372
at a comedy club tonight.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.415
Oh, wow.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.293
Oh, wow.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.253
Should I get him to postpone?

22:57.293 --> 22:59.253
Practice more?

22:59.253 --> 23:00.796
I just don't want him

22:59.253 --> 23:00.796
to fall on his face

23:00.796 --> 23:02.256
after all he's been

23:00.796 --> 23:02.256
through lately.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.841
If he fails, he fails.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.425
He's a big boy,

23:03.841 --> 23:05.425
he can handle it.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.468
( buzzing )

23:06.468 --> 23:07.469
I'm with her.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.024
Oh, my God. Every time I hear

23:17.730 --> 23:20.024
it, it just gets funnier.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.692
Really?

23:20.024 --> 23:21.692
Definitely.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.777
Okay, let's go over my

23:21.692 --> 23:23.777
Godfather as Batman bit again.

23:23.777 --> 23:24.904
Go for it.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.323
( imitating Vito Corleone ):

23:24.904 --> 23:27.323
Hey...

23:27.323 --> 23:30.076
I'm Batman,

23:27.323 --> 23:30.076
and we're family, okay?

23:30.076 --> 23:32.036
So, what do you

23:30.076 --> 23:32.036
think you're doing?

23:32.036 --> 23:33.996
You robbing that bank?

23:33.996 --> 23:36.498
You can't rob from family.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.342
Yes!

23:44.006 --> 23:46.342
Oh, hold on,

23:44.006 --> 23:46.342
it's Catalina.

23:46.342 --> 23:47.593
Hello?

23:47.593 --> 23:49.136
Rafael just ended

23:47.593 --> 23:49.136
our relationship

23:49.136 --> 23:51.097
because you told him

23:49.136 --> 23:51.097
you saw me kissing Arnaud.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.557
You got in the car.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.557
You kissed him.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.892
A friendly kiss.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.434
I don't kiss my friends

23:54.892 --> 23:56.434
like that.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.230
Well, I do,

23:56.434 --> 23:59.230
and you should have called me,

23:59.230 --> 24:00.606
and not run to Rafael.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.066
I don't want him to get hurt.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.067
And what about me?

24:03.067 --> 24:04.610
I've known you for a month

24:04.610 --> 24:05.861
and you've lied the whole time.

24:05.861 --> 24:06.862
He's my child's father.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.031
Well, I guess I know

24:09.031 --> 24:10.157
where your loyalties lie.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.449
Yes, you do.

24:11.449 --> 24:13.660
( cell phone beeps )

24:11.449 --> 24:13.660
Oh.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.956
NARRATOR:

24:13.660 --> 24:16.956
<i>Okay, who's in the mood</i>

24:13.660 --> 24:16.956
<i>for a comedy show?</i>

24:18.874 --> 24:20.960
ALBA ( speaks Spanish ):

24:18.874 --> 24:20.960
How's Michael?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.921
( speaks English ):

24:20.960 --> 24:23.921
Totally calm and I totally feel

24:20.960 --> 24:23.921
like I'm gonna throw up.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.172
( chuckles )

24:25.172 --> 24:26.715
So, is Bruce coming?

24:26.715 --> 24:29.093
No. He has his daughter,

24:29.093 --> 24:30.677
but thanks for inviting him.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.472
You know, I was thinking

24:32.096 --> 24:34.472
about what you said,

24:34.472 --> 24:38.102
about not wanting to see me

24:34.472 --> 24:38.102
that way... and I get it.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.939
But... I've changed...

24:41.939 --> 24:44.691
and maybe that's why

24:41.939 --> 24:44.691
I think he can, too.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.530
Okay, so Darci will be here

24:48.154 --> 24:50.530
any minute.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.867
You said you'd try.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.867
I am trying.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.619
We are scientifically

24:53.867 --> 24:55.619
and mathematically

24:55.619 --> 24:56.662
compatible to breed.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.664
I will show you

24:56.662 --> 24:58.664
the algorithm.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.916
Oh, please, you don't even

24:58.664 --> 25:00.916
know what an algorithm is.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.584
( mocking ):

25:00.916 --> 25:02.584
I do, too.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.544
No, you don't.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.544
Yes, I... shh! Darci.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.047
NARRATOR:

25:04.544 --> 25:07.047
<i>Ooh, this</i>

25:04.544 --> 25:07.047
<i>calls for another drumroll.</i>

25:07.047 --> 25:08.632
( drumroll plays )

25:08.632 --> 25:09.633
Can I get you a drink?

25:09.633 --> 25:11.927
Vodka soda.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.927
Iced tea for me.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.680
Oh, that's right. You're

25:11.927 --> 25:14.680
about to get pregnant.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.556
Got to keep that

25:14.680 --> 25:16.556
body nice and pure.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.600
You've certainly

25:16.556 --> 25:18.600
thought of everything.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.727
It's because I'm driving.

25:20.727 --> 25:21.895
Oh.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.105
Look,

25:21.895 --> 25:23.105
I'm a straight shooter,

25:23.105 --> 25:24.231
so I'm just gonna

25:23.105 --> 25:24.231
say this.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.523
I'm sensing

25:24.231 --> 25:25.523
a little tension here.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.067
NARRATOR:

25:25.523 --> 25:27.067
<i>You think?</i>

25:27.067 --> 25:28.694
I tried to tell her

25:27.067 --> 25:28.694
about the algorithm.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.112
I take it you're not on board

25:30.112 --> 25:31.447
with our plan to co-parent.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.199
You've only known each other

25:31.447 --> 25:33.199
for two weeks.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.992
We've thought

25:33.199 --> 25:34.992
everything through,

25:34.992 --> 25:36.618
negotiated the terms

25:34.992 --> 25:36.618
of our agreement,

25:36.618 --> 25:38.204
and we took my

25:36.618 --> 25:38.204
very comprehensive

25:38.204 --> 25:41.081
compatibility

25:38.204 --> 25:41.081
Love Forecast.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.334
It takes a lot more

25:41.081 --> 25:43.334
than a compatibility test

25:43.334 --> 25:45.044
to make this kind of commitment,

25:45.044 --> 25:47.921
otherwise, everyone matched

25:45.044 --> 25:47.921
on eHarmony would be married.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.924
My Love Forecast is

25:47.921 --> 25:50.924
better than eHarmony's...

25:51.925 --> 25:53.177
...if you're honest.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.553
Question 42 of our

25:53.177 --> 25:55.553
compatibility test is,

25:55.553 --> 25:57.431
"Do you have a

25:55.553 --> 25:57.431
supportive family?"

25:57.431 --> 25:58.432
You checked yes,

25:58.432 --> 26:00.726
and clearly, you don't.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.019
I'm gonna go freshen up.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.984
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

26:11.445 --> 26:13.155
( sighs )

26:11.445 --> 26:13.155
What?

26:14.281 --> 26:16.325
Ma, come on.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.325
You know this is crazy.

26:16.325 --> 26:20.162
( speaks Spanish ):

26:16.325 --> 26:20.162
I know it's what

26:16.325 --> 26:20.162
Rogelio wants.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.374
And frankly,

26:23.374 --> 26:26.043
we've had babies

26:23.374 --> 26:26.043
come into this family

26:26.043 --> 26:28.546
in stranger ways.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.715
Who are you to say?

26:33.259 --> 26:34.592
SCOTT:

26:33.259 --> 26:34.592
<i>Let me fix this.</i>

26:34.592 --> 26:36.429
There must be

26:34.592 --> 26:36.429
something I can do.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.180
No, beautiful sister

26:36.429 --> 26:38.180
is certain.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.848
I must go back

26:38.180 --> 26:39.848
to Czech Republic.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.226
I just wanted to

26:39.848 --> 26:42.226
say good-bye.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.561
I missed you.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.020
Oh, I'm sorry,

26:45.020 --> 26:47.064
it's not the golden

26:45.020 --> 26:47.064
locks you fell for.

26:47.064 --> 26:50.776
Oh, no. I... It was you who

26:47.064 --> 26:50.776
I fell in love with, Anezka.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.986
Please, stay.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.986
We can be together.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.697
Without Petra's money,

26:52.986 --> 26:55.697
I have no place to live.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.823
No, I have money.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.409
Rafael and I made

26:56.823 --> 26:58.409
an arrangement.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.369
I can take care of you,

26:58.409 --> 27:00.369
hide you.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.247
No, she'll find me.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.790
She'll put me in jail.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.459
And...

27:06.459 --> 27:09.378
she's already suspecting you

27:06.459 --> 27:09.378
of something.

27:09.378 --> 27:12.465
Just be careful

27:09.378 --> 27:12.465
around her. Please.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.141
NARRATOR:

27:19.179 --> 27:22.141
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

27:19.179 --> 27:22.141
<i>What is this,</i> The Americans?

27:27.521 --> 27:28.564
He's gonna kill it.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.150
I hope so,

27:28.564 --> 27:31.150
my stomach hurts.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.943
Okay, hello, everyone.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.652
Get ready to laugh...

27:34.652 --> 27:35.946
or not.

27:34.652 --> 27:35.946
I can't really say

27:35.946 --> 27:37.573
because we have

27:35.946 --> 27:37.573
a first-time performer

27:37.573 --> 27:38.656
here at The Laugh Outlet.

27:38.656 --> 27:39.950
So, please give

27:39.950 --> 27:41.494
a "we'll-reserve-judgment"

27:39.950 --> 27:41.494
welcome

27:41.494 --> 27:43.245
to Michael Cordero.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.289
( audience cheering )

27:45.289 --> 27:46.748
( whooping )

27:45.289 --> 27:46.748
Bravo, Michael!

27:46.748 --> 27:47.749
Yeah, baby!

27:47.749 --> 27:49.709
NARRATOR:

27:47.749 --> 27:49.709
<i>Go, Michael!</i>

27:51.753 --> 27:53.213
( heart beats )

27:53.213 --> 27:54.632
<i>Come on.</i>

27:54.632 --> 27:56.342
<i>Go, Michael.</i>

27:57.843 --> 27:59.428
<i>Michael, go.</i>

27:59.428 --> 28:01.472
( heart beats )

28:03.432 --> 28:06.185
This is either a classic

28:03.432 --> 28:06.185
case of stage fright

28:06.185 --> 28:09.605
or an ill-timed series of tiny,

28:06.185 --> 28:09.605
consecutive strokes.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.274
You suck.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.239
(microphone feedback)

28:19.239 --> 28:20.991
Can somebody get me

28:19.239 --> 28:20.991
a gong already?

28:20.991 --> 28:22.034
( woman laughs )

28:22.034 --> 28:23.285
( man imitates gong ringing )

28:23.285 --> 28:24.203
( audience members laugh )

28:24.203 --> 28:25.663
MAN:

28:24.203 --> 28:25.663
Get off the stage.

28:25.663 --> 28:28.374
Psst. You spend a lot

28:25.663 --> 28:28.374
of time with a toddler.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.834
( whispering ):

28:28.374 --> 28:30.834
I should go.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.834
You got this.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.628
You spend a lot of time

28:30.834 --> 28:32.628
with a toddler.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.213
( audience whispering )

28:34.213 --> 28:35.839
You spend a lot of time

28:34.213 --> 28:35.839
with a toddler.

28:35.839 --> 28:37.841
I, uh, I spend a lot of time

28:37.841 --> 28:39.426
with a toddler.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.512
And so...

28:39.426 --> 28:41.512
And so, um, I-I've been watching

28:41.512 --> 28:43.096
( mouthing )

28:41.512 --> 28:43.096
a lot of<i> Sesame Street.</i>

28:43.096 --> 28:46.600
And you know who

28:43.096 --> 28:46.600
goes down there one day? Uh...

28:46.600 --> 28:49.019
Bobcat Goldthwait.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.312
Yeah, you remember him, right?

28:50.312 --> 28:51.897
From the<i> Police Academy</i> movies.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.358
Well, those movies are

28:51.897 --> 28:54.358
actually one of the reasons

28:54.358 --> 28:56.151
why I became a cop, except six,

28:56.151 --> 28:57.944
<i>UnderSiege,</i>

28:56.151 --> 28:57.944
'cause that was just goofy.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.446
( Jane and Rogelio laugh )

28:59.446 --> 29:02.157
Anyway, Bobcat talks

28:59.446 --> 29:02.157
to Cookie Monster, he's like,

29:02.157 --> 29:04.702
( imitating Bobcat Goldthwait ):

29:02.157 --> 29:04.702
Hey, um, uh, Cookie Monster,

29:04.702 --> 29:07.746
um, you want to get the biggest

29:04.702 --> 29:07.746
cookie you've ever seen?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.082
NARRATOR:

29:07.746 --> 29:10.082
<i>Well, this bit goes on longer</i>

29:07.746 --> 29:10.082
<i>than it should,</i>

29:10.082 --> 29:11.709
<i>but it should be noted</i>

29:11.709 --> 29:13.835
<i>that Michael wasn't the worst</i>

29:11.709 --> 29:13.835
<i>comedian in the world.</i>

29:13.835 --> 29:15.504
This is Jerry Seinfeld as E.T.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.464
( imitating Jerry Seinfeld ):

29:15.504 --> 29:17.464
Did you ever have a time

29:17.464 --> 29:20.259
when your finger

29:17.464 --> 29:20.259
just glows for no reason?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.928
The pirate from<i> Captain Phillips</i>

29:20.259 --> 29:22.928
as played by SpongeBob,

29:22.928 --> 29:24.388
uh, Mateo's favorite.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.223
( imitating SpongeBob ):

29:24.388 --> 29:26.223
Look at me! Look at me!

29:26.223 --> 29:27.391
I'm the captain now.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.268
( imitates SpongeBob's laugh )

29:29.268 --> 29:31.228
Dame Judi Dench as Scarface.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.146
( imitating Judi Dench ):

29:31.228 --> 29:33.146
First you get the money,

29:33.146 --> 29:36.275
then... you get the power,

29:36.275 --> 29:38.193
then you get the woman.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.195
That one went right

29:38.193 --> 29:40.195
over Mateo's head.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.740
NARRATOR:

29:40.195 --> 29:42.740
<i>At least, not to the people</i>

29:40.195 --> 29:42.740
<i>who loved him the most.</i>

29:44.991 --> 29:47.661
<i>But on a less comedic note...</i>

29:48.787 --> 29:51.457
EMILIO:

29:48.787 --> 29:51.457
<i>You are such a disappointment.</i>

29:51.457 --> 29:52.999
We're at 50% capacity.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.209
Dad, I'm working on that.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.587
Just give me a chance.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.547
You're lazy.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.547
You're unmotivated.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.382
You've accomplished nothing.

30:01.925 --> 30:04.303
Look at your sister.

30:01.925 --> 30:04.303
Even she is on the right path.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.096
Dad, I don't understand

30:04.303 --> 30:06.096

30:48.514 --> 30:50.932
Frankly, I don't care.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.434

I could have forgiven you

31:02.778 --> 31:05.238

31:22.130 --> 31:23.549
He told me.

31:24.633 --> 31:25.884
I went to him,

31:25.884 --> 31:29.388
as Anezka,

31:25.884 --> 31:29.388
and he told me.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.517

like I...

31:33.517 --> 31:36.687
( chuckles )

31:33.517 --> 31:36.687

I'm sorry.

31:39.690 --> 31:43.109
Well, I'm not.

'Cause now I know

to get what you want.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.617
But let me tell you something.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.788
You... have absolutely no idea

31:58.333 --> 32:00.960
<i>So I wanted to apologize.</i>

32:00.960 --> 32:04.757
I was rude before,

32:00.960 --> 32:04.757
and I want to assure you

32:04.757 --> 32:07.175
that Rogelio does have

32:04.757 --> 32:07.175
a supportive family.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.343
Doesn't seem like it.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.220
Look, I'm just

32:08.343 --> 32:10.220
protective of him.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.847
You guys are moving fast.

32:11.847 --> 32:12.972
In some ways.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.474
But we've both been

32:12.972 --> 32:14.474
wanting children

32:14.474 --> 32:15.601
for a really long time,

32:15.601 --> 32:16.976
and we've both been

32:15.601 --> 32:16.976
unlucky in love.

32:16.976 --> 32:19.187
It's a gamble.

32:16.976 --> 32:19.187
Love is a gamble.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.107
This is methodical.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.692
I'm only looking

32:22.107 --> 32:23.692
for one quality,

32:23.692 --> 32:25.235
and that's a good father

32:23.692 --> 32:25.235
for my child.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.029
And I know Rogelio

32:26.570 --> 32:28.029
will be one

32:28.029 --> 32:29.989
because of the way he talks

32:28.029 --> 32:29.989
about your daughter.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.827
There you are.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.827
Should we go?

32:33.827 --> 32:35.579
I'm shooting my film

32:33.827 --> 32:35.579
tomorrow morning,

32:35.579 --> 32:38.540
and, unlike Beyoncé,

32:35.579 --> 32:38.540
I don't wake up like this.

Break a leg.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.837
Oh, and I was just

32:40.250 --> 32:43.837
telling Darci,

32:43.837 --> 32:47.132
question number 42?

32:47.132 --> 32:49.050
It's a yes.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.306
So, question.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.306
Hmm?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.766
Did you really think

32:54.306 --> 32:55.766
I was funny

32:55.766 --> 32:57.225
when I was practicing

32:55.766 --> 32:57.225
and stuff?

32:58.518 --> 32:59.937
I mean, yeah.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.397
Not totally.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.150
Oh, my God.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.150
Why didn't you tell me?

33:05.150 --> 33:06.485
You let me make

33:05.150 --> 33:06.485
a fool of myself.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.153
I wanted to stay out

33:06.485 --> 33:08.153
of it and be supportive,

33:08.153 --> 33:09.863
like Mr. Let It Bee said.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.907
Oh, I almost forgot

33:09.863 --> 33:11.907
about Mr. Let It Bee.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.116
I shouldn't have brought it up.

Mr. Let It Bee's

33:30.175 --> 33:32.302

Bruce got mad,

36:42.117 --> 36:44.744
wearing them for a few seconds.

36:46.371 --> 36:49.290
All right.

36:46.371 --> 36:49.290
Contract signed.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.292
Good luck out there.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.292
Wait.

36:52.669 --> 36:56.548
Sorry, I'm just

36:52.669 --> 36:56.548
a little nervous.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.008
Is it the nudity?

36:58.008 --> 37:01.970
God, no, not that.

36:58.008 --> 37:01.970
That's nothing.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.430
It's just that I'm used

37:01.970 --> 37:04.430
to telenovelas,

37:04.430 --> 37:06.432
and this is indie film acting.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.851
It's more subtle.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.227
I just want it to be great.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.106
Now, listen, Rogelio.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.441
Don't you let

37:13.106 --> 37:15.441
that doubt creep in.

37:15.441 --> 37:18.528
I know your matchmaking profile

37:15.441 --> 37:18.528
inside and out,

37:18.528 --> 37:20.906
and your confidence quadrant

37:18.528 --> 37:20.906
was off the charts.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.491
And one day our kid

37:20.906 --> 37:23.491
is gonna be so proud of you

37:23.491 --> 37:25.243
for giving this great

37:23.491 --> 37:25.243
performance,

37:25.243 --> 37:26.703
so you get out there.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.454
Do it for our future spawn.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.207
Come with me?

37:30.207 --> 37:31.708
I'd love to.

37:42.635 --> 37:46.014
I can't do this anymore.

37:46.014 --> 37:49.142
I don't want to feel anymore.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.029
Um, Rogelio...

38:04.950 --> 38:07.244
Oh, my!

38:07.244 --> 38:09.328
Yeah, can you do

38:07.244 --> 38:09.328
something about that?

38:12.331 --> 38:13.959
I don't think

38:12.331 --> 38:13.959
I can just now.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.961
NARRATOR:

38:13.959 --> 38:15.961
<i>Yep, his feelings for Darci</i>

38:15.961 --> 38:17.629
<i>had definitely come up.</i>

38:19.505 --> 38:21.633
( keys clacking )

38:25.511 --> 38:27.388
Thanks for leaving

38:25.511 --> 38:27.388
the stage.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.684
And I have something

38:28.932 --> 38:31.684
to confess.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.686
I've grown feelings

38:31.684 --> 38:33.686
for you.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.273
Yeah, I kind of

38:33.686 --> 38:36.273
picked up on that.

38:37.190 --> 38:38.775
But you gotta

38:37.190 --> 38:38.775
get over it

38:38.775 --> 38:40.819
if you want to have

38:38.775 --> 38:40.819
a baby with me, understand?

38:44.156 --> 38:45.657
( sighs )

38:44.156 --> 38:45.657
How bad is it?

38:45.657 --> 38:46.741
Did I make everything worse?

38:46.741 --> 38:48.118
Actually,

38:46.741 --> 38:48.118
Bruce and Tess had

38:48.118 --> 38:50.411
their first bonding moment

38:48.118 --> 38:50.411
in a while,

38:50.411 --> 38:52.497
over how unhinged

38:50.411 --> 38:52.497
you seem to be.

38:52.497 --> 38:55.083
And we rescheduled brunch.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.210
She's giving me a chance.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.210
That's great.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.795
I'm so happy I helped.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.795
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

38:58.795 --> 38:59.879
no helping anymore.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.631
Why? Michael appreciates it.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.216
He's your husband.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.383
There are many,

39:03.216 --> 39:04.383
many things

39:04.383 --> 39:05.844
you should do with your husband

39:05.844 --> 39:07.762
that you shouldn't do

39:05.844 --> 39:07.762
with your mom.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.762
Good point.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.597
I'll stay out of your

39:07.762 --> 39:09.597
relationship with Bruce.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.516
Gotta go. Love you.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.071
Sorry, I lost track of time.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.615
Hey, so listen...

39:27.615 --> 39:29.326
You don't need to tell me.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.326
It's your business.

39:29.326 --> 39:30.827
NARRATOR:

39:29.326 --> 39:30.827
<i>Good choice.</i>

NARRATOR:

39:37.000 --> 39:39.252
<i>I think.</i>

39:39.252 --> 39:42.630
It just seems like a disaster

39:39.252 --> 39:42.630
waiting to happen, that's all.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.174
But you're staying

39:42.630 --> 39:44.174
out of it, right?

39:44.174 --> 39:46.384
Mm-hmm.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.468
Random question.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.929
How 'bout a lawyer?

39:47.468 --> 39:49.929
For what?

39:49.929 --> 39:52.098
For me, like, as a job?

39:53.183 --> 39:54.767
I mean, it's related

39:53.183 --> 39:54.767
to police work

39:54.767 --> 39:56.811
and investigating, you know?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.521
Whenever I testify

39:56.811 --> 39:58.521
in cases,

39:58.521 --> 40:00.357
I always thought

39:58.521 --> 40:00.357
the legal positioning

40:00.357 --> 40:01.607
was interesting.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.568
Yeah, that's true.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.568
Yeah.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.695
But it's not practical.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.695
I'd have to go back to school.

40:05.695 --> 40:07.322
So you go back to school.

40:07.322 --> 40:10.158
Does it feel exciting?

40:07.322 --> 40:10.158
That's the important thing.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.660
Is it something you could

40:10.158 --> 40:12.660
see yourself doing long-term?

40:12.660 --> 40:15.830
Yeah, I think so.

40:15.830 --> 40:20.126
I mean, the law offices

40:15.830 --> 40:20.126
of Michael Cordero Jr.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.502
I like the sound of that.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.171
Oh, wow, you opened

40:21.502 --> 40:23.171
your own firm already.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.256
Well, I gotta dream big.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.882
That's what I'm

40:24.256 --> 40:25.882
talking about.

NARRATOR:

40:25.882 --> 40:27.592
<i>Ah, to see that dream</i>

40:27.592 --> 40:29.177
<i>come true.</i>

40:29.177 --> 40:30.595
<i>But alas...</i>

40:30.595 --> 40:33.181
I'm not gonna

40:30.595 --> 40:33.181
sugarcoat things, okay?

40:33.181 --> 40:36.226
Because I'm your lawyer,

40:33.181 --> 40:36.226
so there's confidentiality here.

40:36.226 --> 40:39.437
I'm thinking your father

40:36.226 --> 40:39.437
suspected you weren't his son.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.980
That's why he wrote

40:39.437 --> 40:40.980
this addendum.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.776
So am I really entitled

40:42.607 --> 40:44.776
to nothing?

40:44.776 --> 40:47.820
That's only if

40:44.776 --> 40:47.820
the addendum is probated.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.031
From what you're telling me,

40:50.031 --> 40:52.617
you're the only one

40:50.031 --> 40:52.617
who knows it exists.
