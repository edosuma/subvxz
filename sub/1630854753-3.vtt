WEBVTT

00:20.324 --> 00:22.805
D'Alessandro.
They made you captain?

00:22.892 --> 00:24.415
Hello, Johnson.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.462
I see you're back in cuffs,
where you belong.

00:27.549 --> 00:28.985
How's that house you bought
in the Jersey Shore

00:29.072 --> 00:30.682
with all that pat
that I used to pay you?

00:30.769 --> 00:32.554
Old dogs, new tricks.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.164
$20,000 down.

00:35.557 --> 00:39.126
The Reverend has asked me
to oversee the HARYOU program.

00:39.213 --> 00:44.131
And as she will be assuming
a very public position,

00:44.218 --> 00:46.133
we'll all have to keep
on the straight and narrow,

00:46.220 --> 00:47.743
now, won't we?

00:47.830 --> 00:50.311
I would love for you
to come with me to Africa

00:50.398 --> 00:52.530
after my trip to Mecca.

00:52.617 --> 00:55.664
I killed a man.
It was self-defense.

00:55.751 --> 00:58.623
There was a hit out on me.
My stepmother.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.626
If he wants me to secure Harlem
and Bumpy Johnson,

01:01.713 --> 01:04.281
I'm gonna need his influence
over the other bosses.

01:04.368 --> 01:05.978
Mr. Gigante would be willing

01:06.066 --> 01:08.155
to give you his support
under one condition--

01:08.242 --> 01:10.157
that you protect his daughter.

01:10.244 --> 01:13.377
You find her, keep her safe,
Chin will do what you ask.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.205
Joe Colombo, a friend
of your father's.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.860
- What do you want from me?
- I wanna help you.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.340
By kidnapping me?

01:19.427 --> 01:21.864
I'm proposing
a short-term bridge loan.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.693
Investing in your venture
was a terrible mistake.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.261
Venture?
Call it what it is, Judge.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.306
It was a heroin deal.

01:29.393 --> 01:32.179
You can't run Harlem alone, Ellsworth.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.267
You need an alliance.

01:33.354 --> 01:36.183
Set a meet with Jose Battle.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.793
But he's got men.
He's got guns.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.274
He can help us change
the balance of power.

01:40.361 --> 01:41.753
You want to be partners
with me?

01:41.840 --> 01:43.799
There's gonna be a war
in Harlem.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.496
The only war I'm interested
in fighting

01:45.583 --> 01:48.325
is the one to take back
my country, Cuba.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.327
We're both fighting to take
back our homelands.

01:50.414 --> 01:51.459
Mine is Harlem.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.330
Together, we'll be so strong

01:53.417 --> 01:56.203
the Italians
won't even dare start a war.

used to say,

02:40.421 --> 02:42.901
"Fire don't crack a full pot."

02:42.988 --> 02:44.642
Here's to keeping our pot full.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.470

02:50.039 --> 02:52.302
I'm going to speak
for all us in saying

02:52.389 --> 02:54.391
it's been well worth the risk.

02:54.478 --> 02:57.960
Yes, yes.
Exceeding expectations.

02:58.047 --> 03:01.311
I told you, gentlemen,
I wouldn't steer you wrong.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.835
These go down awfully easy.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.359
Cuba Libres.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.274
That's rum,
Coca-Cola, and lime--

03:07.361 --> 03:10.277
the drink of Cuba's independence
since 19--

03:10.364 --> 03:11.800
Enough.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.411
Let's get the business
out of the way.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.854
Jesus, Bumpy, how much
are we talking about here?

03:22.941 --> 03:24.682
Nine-fifty.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.423
Well, that's substantially
more than last week.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.687
Why is that man
holding a gun?

03:29.774 --> 03:32.299
I told you I don't want
to be around any guns.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.301
Let's just finish
what we started.

03:34.388 --> 03:37.521
Then you can go back upstairs
and enjoy the party, alright?

03:37.608 --> 03:38.957
Fine.

03:40.872 --> 03:44.441
But if I ever see one more gun,
you can count me out.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.326
Let me tell you something.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.979
That fucking judge
better watch

04:01.066 --> 04:02.459
the way he fucking
look at me, man.

04:02.546 --> 04:03.982
I take my blade, I cut him

04:04.069 --> 04:06.028
across his big, fat
motherfucking ass.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.552
See how he likes sitting on the
fucking bench after that shit.

04:08.639 --> 04:12.556
He's difficult but manageable.
I can handle him.

04:15.429 --> 04:18.388
You handle everything.
I like the way you work.

04:18.475 --> 04:21.565
Combining our numbers was a nice
economy of scale, wasn't it?

04:21.652 --> 04:25.743
I'm talking about us as men,

04:25.830 --> 04:28.746
as people defending
their land against invaders.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.402
I need a favor from you.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.361
Anything serious?

04:34.448 --> 04:36.363
I just need you
to kill somebody.

04:39.627 --> 04:44.762
That's my sister, Riza.
Her husband, Santo.

04:44.849 --> 04:48.810
Their beautiful girls,
Savina and Severa, my nieces.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.551
You can't tell
from this photo,

04:50.638 --> 04:55.512
but my sister is pregnant
with her third child.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.559
It's a beautiful family.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.561
Sometime after this photo
was taken--

05:00.648 --> 05:02.693
I don't know, maybe
three weeks or something--

05:02.780 --> 05:06.436
their home was raided
by Fidel's men.

05:06.523 --> 05:13.530
My sister and my nieces
were tied together with wire

05:13.617 --> 05:17.447
and taken out
to behind the house.

05:17.534 --> 05:21.843
My brother-in-law was tied
to a chair, his eyes held open

05:21.930 --> 05:28.545
as they executed his family,
my family by firing squad.

05:31.505 --> 05:32.767
I'm sorry, Jose.

05:40.514 --> 05:43.995
The man responsible
for this is that guy.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.998
Madera. Juan Madera.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.566
One of Castro's most
trusted lieutenants.

05:49.653 --> 05:53.614
This garbage lied to me
about which side he was on

05:53.701 --> 05:56.530
and gave Fidel's men
the location of my family.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.011
Snitch.

06:00.098 --> 06:03.450
This Madera is here,
in New York City.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.452
My men are looking for him
in Spanish Harlem,

06:05.539 --> 06:08.455
but I think he might be hiding
in your neighborhood.

06:09.543 --> 06:10.370
We'll find him.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.850
And kill him.

06:14.156 --> 06:17.638
Before he escapes
back to Cuba.

06:17.725 --> 06:22.947
Bumpy, when I am a partner,
your problems become mine,

06:23.034 --> 06:25.559
and I hope that mine
become yours.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.714
I am also known
as Malcolm X.

08:19.281 --> 08:22.589
- Malcolm X from America?
- Yes, sir.

08:22.676 --> 08:25.983
Uh, you'll find a letter signed
by Dr. Mahmoud Shawarbi

08:26.070 --> 08:28.769
of the United Nations attesting
to the fact I am a Muslim.

08:31.859 --> 08:36.603
This is not
an official document.

08:36.690 --> 08:40.998
Uh, Dr. Shawarbi assured me it
would, uh, suffice as such.

08:41.085 --> 08:44.262
Only the Maghama Sharia
can determine your status

08:44.349 --> 08:48.963
as a convert to Islam, and you
may not enter Mecca without it.

08:49.050 --> 08:52.053
Sir, with all due respect,
you know who I am.

08:52.140 --> 08:57.711
I have traveled very far to be
here, made many sacrifices.

08:57.798 --> 09:00.627
The Saudi ambassador himself
is the one who told me

09:00.714 --> 09:03.020
to have my visa
signed by Dr. Shawarbi.

09:03.107 --> 09:06.023
Then the Saudi ambassador
should have also informed you

09:06.110 --> 09:09.810
any attempt to enter
the Hajj as a non-Muslim

09:09.897 --> 09:12.160
is considered a crime
under Saudi law.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.596
Detain him.

09:14.945 --> 09:15.903
Come on.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.878
"Executive Director
Mayme Johnson

09:34.965 --> 09:37.794
stole the spotlight
last Saturday

09:37.881 --> 09:40.667
at the organization's meeting
at Benjamin Franklin High School

09:40.754 --> 09:44.801
when in her remarks preceding
Adam Clayton Powell,"

09:44.888 --> 09:47.761
"she announced
a national voter hotline

09:47.848 --> 09:50.198
to help black voters find
the right polling stations.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.244
Johnson's brilliant idea
was cheered

09:53.331 --> 09:59.076
by over 600 Harlemites
crammed in the gymnasium."

09:59.163 --> 10:01.862
Well, what can I say?
I learned from the best.

10:01.949 --> 10:04.995
Mm, and that's the only thing
you can say.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.694
You know, a smart master knows

10:07.781 --> 10:10.827
that the better
his student shines,

10:10.914 --> 10:14.178
the better he shines.

10:14.265 --> 10:18.226
Well, good, because she's about
about to be a whole lot shinier.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.619
Tell him.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.884
I just got off the phone
with Hamilton Tiegs, chairman

10:23.971 --> 10:26.103
of the National Newspaper
Publishers Association,

10:26.190 --> 10:28.802
and they have agreed
starting Wednesday

10:28.889 --> 10:31.892
to run "Get Out the Vote" ads
free of charge.

10:31.979 --> 10:34.938
Really?
Well, that is outstanding.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.375
Just make sure they
don't stick it in the back

10:37.462 --> 10:40.901
next to Hope's Horoscopes
and "used couch for sale."

10:43.294 --> 10:44.687
Mm-hmm?

10:46.036 --> 10:48.343
Someone from the District
Attorney's office is here.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.825
Oh, Lord have mercy.
What the hell do they want?

10:51.912 --> 10:53.435
Let him in.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.353
Is it a Christmas card
come early?

10:59.267 --> 11:02.444
Mayme Johnson,
you have been deposed

11:02.531 --> 11:03.880
by the United States Attorney

11:03.967 --> 11:05.099
for the Southern District
of New York.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.324
What?

11:15.370 --> 11:18.895
- Morgenthau?
- Morgenthau's in Washington.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.463
This is from Assistant District
Attorney Jonathan Pike.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.945
Oh, a real hard-ass,
from what I hear.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.817
He wants to meet at my apartment
this afternoon.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.819
House call?

11:29.906 --> 11:33.780
Oh. That's not good.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.349
Show this picture
to all of your runners.

11:38.436 --> 11:42.005
His name is Juan Madera.
Put the word out on the street.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.920
I wanna find him.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.400
What this guy do?

11:45.487 --> 11:47.010
Something horrible in Cuba.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.926
Why we gotta do
Battle's dirty work for him?

11:50.013 --> 11:51.841
He helped us with Joe Colombo.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.321
And when the next duji shipment
comes in,

11:53.408 --> 11:55.236
we'll need him for men,
money, and guns,

11:55.323 --> 11:58.065
so if we gotta do some bullshit
favor, then we do it.

11:59.501 --> 12:02.025
Okay. Okay.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.158
So we'll check out
this Madera cat.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.813
I want you to find
this motherfucker

12:06.900 --> 12:08.423
and you kill him.

12:17.954 --> 12:21.131
Can I please get
a glass of water?

13:02.564 --> 13:04.479
Do you speak English?

13:11.051 --> 13:12.269
Floor.

13:14.010 --> 13:14.924
Floor.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.275
Ceiling.

13:19.973 --> 13:23.280
- Ceiling.
- Mm-hmm.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.587
Muhammad Ali. Clay?

13:25.674 --> 13:28.503
Ali?

13:28.590 --> 13:29.939
Muhammad Ali?

13:30.026 --> 13:32.202
Muhammad Ali!

13:32.289 --> 13:34.161
No, no, not me. Not me.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.033
But I know him.
It looks like you do too.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.079
- Muhammad Ali?
- No.

13:39.166 --> 13:43.039
Yeah. Name Muhammad Ali.
Muhammad Ali.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.476
But why would the
assistant district attorney

13:45.563 --> 13:47.261
wanna meet with me?

13:47.348 --> 13:48.915
I mean, other than something
having to do with you.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.917
The feds got no case
against me right now.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.397
Oh, it just feels so ominous.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.531
That's what they want it to feel
like. Don't worry about it.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.926
I just don't want this
to jeopardize

14:00.013 --> 14:01.710
everything I'm building
right now.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.364
This is what happens
when your profile gets raised.

14:03.451 --> 14:06.062
You know that.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.064
I guess so.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.632
In fact, it's probably Powell
they wanna talk to you about.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.069
Those Dixiecrats
are looking for dirt

14:13.156 --> 14:15.376
to derail
his voting rights bill.

14:15.463 --> 14:21.512
Look, go talk to this guy Pike.
No big deal.

14:21.599 --> 14:26.343
You've done nothing wrong
and you got nothing to hide.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.135
Thank you.

15:13.303 --> 15:19.092
I--I know it's not much,
but it'll do, you know, for now.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.571
How long are you
keeping me here for?

15:20.658 --> 15:23.139
Until I'm certain
that you're safe.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.619
I can keep myself safe.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.581
Someone tried to
have you killed, Stella.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.540
They may try it again.

15:32.627 --> 15:36.674
And I made a promise to your
pops that I'd look after you.

15:36.761 --> 15:40.591
How do you know he wasn't
the one who tried to whack me?

15:40.678 --> 15:42.158
Come on, what are
you talking about?

15:42.245 --> 15:45.553
He's the one asking me
to protect you.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.163
Listen.

15:47.250 --> 15:51.080
I'll get you some
new furniture, wallpaper,

15:51.167 --> 15:53.300
spruce the place up, and...

15:53.387 --> 15:56.129
And then you-- you
expect me to just, what,

15:56.216 --> 15:59.045
sit here all day long?

16:00.524 --> 16:03.049
What would you like to do?

16:03.136 --> 16:07.053
If I'm staying here,
I'm going back to school.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.055
And I'm gonna get a job.

16:09.142 --> 16:13.755
School can wait, but I think
I might have a job for you.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.279
What's that?

16:16.366 --> 16:19.065
Working for me.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.067
Come on.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.781
<i>As-salamu alaykum,</i> Malcolm.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.217
It is a great honor
to meet you.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.481
<i>Wa-alaykum-Salaam.</i>
And you are?

16:44.568 --> 16:46.266
Dr. Omar Azzam.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.181
Welcome to Mecca.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.227
A prison cell is not
my idea of a welcome.

16:51.314 --> 16:54.317
No, of course not.
I am so sorry.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.798
I am here to help you with that.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.366
Your arrival here in Mecca
has caused quite a stir

16:59.453 --> 17:01.498
in the international press.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.674
The Royal Family itself asked me

17:03.761 --> 17:05.807
to help petition the Maghama
Sharia on your behalf.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.244
Well, that's just fine.
Thank you.

17:08.331 --> 17:13.119
See? Allah answers our prayers,
especially in Mecca.

17:13.206 --> 17:16.122
Thank you, Dr. Azzam.

17:16.209 --> 17:19.560
Perhaps you'd be so kind
to give me a lift to my hotel.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.127
I'm sorry.
You cannot go there.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.954
Why not?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.304
The Sharia court will
not be able to hear your case

17:24.391 --> 17:26.654
for several days yet.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.309
I see.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.572
My friend, forgive me
for not being clear.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.139
You do not have to stay here.

17:33.226 --> 17:36.403
You can leave,
but with a chaperone.

17:36.490 --> 17:39.232
And who might that be?

17:39.319 --> 17:43.149
I invite you to come stay
with my family in my home.

17:43.236 --> 17:46.413
- In your home?
- Yes.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.243
I've never been invited
to a white man's home before.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.245
Praise Allah. Now you have.

17:52.332 --> 17:55.248
Of course,
if you'd rather stay here...

18:01.297 --> 18:02.951
<i>Salaam alaykum.</i>

18:03.038 --> 18:04.779
- Goodbye, Muhammad Ali.
- Goodbye, Muhammad Ali.

18:09.262 --> 18:12.091
Dr. Azzam, please lead the way.

18:16.965 --> 18:20.229
Mr. Pike,
why are we here?

18:20.316 --> 18:22.405
You're the new director
of HARYOU, are you not?

18:22.492 --> 18:24.451
Yes.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.714
HARYOU has accepted
numerous donations

18:26.801 --> 18:29.325
from Ellsworth Johnson,
your husband.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.327
The Johnsons
are entitled to give

18:31.414 --> 18:33.373
to whichever charities
they wish.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.853
Including a recent donation...

18:35.940 --> 18:40.206
...of $50,000 in cash.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.906
It's a very sizable donation.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.258
Where did that money come from?

18:49.345 --> 18:52.435
Well, my husband's a legitimate
businessman, Mr. Pike.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.438
Rumor has it
your husband's partnered

18:55.525 --> 18:57.788
with a Cuban criminal
named Jose Battle.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.442
I know nothing about that.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.401
Well, I do.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.578
And I think that's dirty money.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.449
Do you have proof?

19:06.536 --> 19:08.234
Well, I find it strange
that Reverend Powell's content

19:08.321 --> 19:11.411
to have the wife
of a convicted felon

19:11.498 --> 19:14.327
so close to such
an important program.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.633
I resent that.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.940
She's doing
great work for us.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.290
That may be.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.771
But if I can prove
any illegality

19:23.858 --> 19:28.689
associated with her
or her husband,

19:28.776 --> 19:32.258
the Justice Department will
shut your whole program down.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.481
Look, this is
an easy gig here.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.267
Phone rings, answer it.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.878
Take a message, open the mail,
order in lunch.

19:43.965 --> 19:47.447
We both know you can't keep me
prisoner here forever.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.406
I'll just walk right out of here
the second I get a chance.

19:50.493 --> 19:53.322
You need my protection, Stella.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.759
It's what your father wants.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.587
What about what I want?

19:57.674 --> 20:00.286
My father's been trying
to control me my whole life.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.331
Even now, he's in jail and
he's still trying to control me.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.725
He wants you alive.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.684
Until we are 100% sure

20:07.771 --> 20:10.557
that none of these other dons
wants to do you harm,

20:10.644 --> 20:13.429
it's my job to keep you safe.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.301
Okay?

20:16.998 --> 20:19.348
<i>♪ Sees so many guys♪</i>

20:19.435 --> 20:21.742
<i>♪ Speaks so low and mild♪</i>

20:21.829 --> 20:24.614
<i>♪ One day she will marry,
settle down after a while♪</i>

20:24.701 --> 20:25.789
<i>♪ Betsy don't allow me♪</i>

20:25.876 --> 20:27.313
Fine.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.489
But I wanna get paid
for this job,

20:29.576 --> 20:31.926
and I don't want you
in my face 24 hours a day.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.713
I'll tell you what.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.760
Long as you let me know
where you're gonna be

20:39.847 --> 20:45.635
and I can keep my men with you,
that's fine.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.899
We'll discuss salary
over dinner.

20:48.986 --> 20:51.380
Dinner?
Jesus, you got balls on you.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.121
Why? You don't eat?

20:53.208 --> 20:54.905
<i>♪ Let her steal his heart away♪</i>

20:54.992 --> 20:56.342
<i>♪ She'll break it just for fun♪</i>

21:00.476 --> 21:02.478
You sure Pinky spotted
him going into this diner?

21:02.565 --> 21:04.524
Who the hell knows, man?

21:04.611 --> 21:07.527
You know Pinky's blind
in one eye, right?

21:07.614 --> 21:09.050
Well, that just
probably means

21:09.137 --> 21:11.052
the other eye probably
got stronger.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.793
What are you
talking about?

21:12.880 --> 21:15.752
When one eye goes dead,
the other eye gets,

21:15.839 --> 21:17.493
like, super vision.

21:17.580 --> 21:21.671
Where the fuck you
get this shit from, man?

21:21.758 --> 21:23.064
Science.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.373
Oh, shit. Is that him?

21:27.460 --> 21:29.157
It sure look like it.

21:29.244 --> 21:33.553
Wow. I guess you were right
about Pinky's one eye.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.945
You want the snubnose?

21:35.032 --> 21:37.383
Too loud for around here
right now.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.907
You can hear a snubnose
three blocks away.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.823
- Shit. That's him?
- Yeah, that's him.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.781
You want the .22?

21:44.868 --> 21:46.043
- Junie's .22?
- Yeah.

21:46.130 --> 21:49.395
Nah, Junie's .22
will jam up.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.398
I got that Luger
in the glove compartment.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.400
Okay.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.537
Hold on, hold on. Witnesses.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.583
Okay.

22:03.670 --> 22:08.544
I'ma just push up to the end of
the block past all these kids.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.512
Shit.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.774
Alright, he's moving.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.558
- I'm jumping.
- You're jumping?

22:22.645 --> 22:24.560
I'm going, I'm going!

22:24.647 --> 22:26.649
Where you going? Wait, wait!

22:30.087 --> 22:31.350
Shit!

22:42.709 --> 22:44.145
Hey.

22:47.714 --> 22:48.671
What the fuck?

23:15.611 --> 23:17.570
You know, most people
here in Mecca

23:17.657 --> 23:19.876
have never met
a Muslim from America.

23:19.963 --> 23:22.705
- That includes you?
- I'm afraid so.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.970
I'm familiar
with many of your speeches.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.190
I'm particularly
fond of that line

23:29.277 --> 23:31.758
"We didn't land
on Plymouth Rock.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.500
The rock landed on us."

23:34.587 --> 23:36.980
I'm glad it amused you.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.852
But tell me,
is my understanding correct

23:38.939 --> 23:41.071
that you wish to start
your own country

23:41.158 --> 23:44.945
within the United States
of just Black Muslims?

23:45.032 --> 23:46.990
That's one solution. Yes.

23:47.077 --> 23:50.516
See, the race problem in America
is not going to fix itself.

23:50.603 --> 23:53.606
Separation is
a viable alternative.

23:53.693 --> 23:56.565
Why is that?

23:56.652 --> 23:59.786
We were taught to speak
the white man's tongue,

23:59.873 --> 24:02.528
to worship the white God,

24:02.615 --> 24:04.747
to accept the white man
as superior.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.924
To whites such as yourself
Negroes are nothing

24:08.011 --> 24:11.101
but ex-slaves trying to
enter the slave master's house

24:11.188 --> 24:12.886
where they're
not wanted anyway.

24:12.973 --> 24:14.844
I see.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.933
Are there no good whites
in your country?

24:17.020 --> 24:20.067
There are some white liberals
who are political hypocrites.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.808
They use the Negroes
as bargaining chips

24:21.895 --> 24:24.941
to get bills passed
so their power will increase.

24:26.029 --> 24:30.077
It seems to me, Mr. X,

24:30.164 --> 24:33.950
that you are a racist
in your own fashion,

24:34.037 --> 24:37.563
judging only
by exterior appearances.

24:47.137 --> 24:50.010
Margaret says, "They gave me
a room with a nice view

24:50.097 --> 24:51.577
and a girl
who's from Charlottesville.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.100
We're friends already."

24:53.187 --> 24:54.710
Mm, so much for
missing her two moms.

24:54.797 --> 24:55.929
Mm.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.627
Ow, goddamn it!

24:58.714 --> 24:59.889
Put some pressure on it.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.591
I am just not myself right now.

25:05.678 --> 25:06.896
What's wrong?

25:11.727 --> 25:14.034
I'll get you a Band-aid.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.776
Hey.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.212
What happened?

25:18.299 --> 25:21.694
Oh, nothing.
I-- I cut my finger.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.522
Let me see.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.830
Is that better?

25:32.748 --> 25:37.187
I spoke with Assistant
District Attorney Pike today.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.885
It has nothing to do
with Powell.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.887
Go on.

25:40.974 --> 25:44.934
He knows about your association
with Jose Battle.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.720
He's trying
to push me out of HARYOU.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.244
Threatened to shut down
the entire program.

25:50.331 --> 25:51.811
He can't do that.
You've done nothing wrong.

25:51.898 --> 25:54.814
You're right. I haven't.
But you have.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.295
He can't touch you.

25:58.382 --> 26:01.081
He doesn't have to.

26:01.168 --> 26:04.040
I am jeopardizing the whole
program because of you.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.695
Powell needs you.
He'll fight for you, alright?

26:06.782 --> 26:08.741
I mean, maybe now.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.830
But what happens when you
start selling duji again?

26:10.917 --> 26:12.266
The feds will be all over you.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.094
- What then?
- I can deal with them.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.662
You were in jail for 11 years
because of that drug.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.838
What do you want from me?

26:18.925 --> 26:22.668
I gotta do what I gotta do to
stay alive and to stay strong.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.931
And if that gets in your way,

26:25.018 --> 26:27.803
then there's nothing
I can do about it.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.724
Let me ask you this.

26:35.811 --> 26:39.685
Won't the new civil rights laws
change anything in America?

26:39.772 --> 26:41.730
They'll afford
the Negro the right

26:41.817 --> 26:44.603
to use a white man's toilet,
nothing more than that.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.998
The white men in your country

26:49.085 --> 26:51.261
no longer
physically enslave you.

26:51.348 --> 26:53.742
The shackles are removed
from your body,

26:53.829 --> 26:55.875
but remain in the heart.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.703
Very true.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.706
One of the beautiful things
about the Hajj

27:00.793 --> 27:04.100
is that Allah delivers us
from all forms of bondage,

27:04.187 --> 27:08.409
chains we can see
and those that are invisible.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.150
Praise Allah.

27:12.848 --> 27:16.286
But I-- I don't even know

27:16.373 --> 27:18.332
if the court will allow me
to go on the Hajj.

27:18.419 --> 27:20.290
That is of no importance.

27:20.377 --> 27:21.814
You are already in Mecca.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.380
No matter what the court says,

27:23.467 --> 27:26.166
I believe your Hajj
has already started.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.867
Will you join me in prayer?

27:31.954 --> 27:36.219
I'm sorry, Dr. Azzam, but in the
black Muslim faith I practice,

27:36.306 --> 27:38.787
whites and Blacks are not
supposed to pray together.

28:09.949 --> 28:13.822
How would you react
if one of your people told you

28:13.909 --> 28:16.869
that their shit wasn't
motherfuckin' loaded?

28:18.435 --> 28:21.351
Ain't no excuse, Bump.

28:21.438 --> 28:24.267
Y-yeah, Bump.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.487
It ain't nothing
but a flat fuck-up.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.143
And he saw your face?

28:32.362 --> 28:35.061
Yeah, yeah. H-He saw us.

28:35.148 --> 28:41.894
You boys fucked up in some sort
of Hall of Fame type shit.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.940
Get the fuck out of my face.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.508
Get the fuck out of my face!

28:47.595 --> 28:48.944
Damn.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.255
Thing is, Bump,

28:55.342 --> 28:57.257
something's botherin' the fuck
outta me about this Madera cat.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.998
What?

28:59.085 --> 29:01.870
I got a real eyeball
full of this dude.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.090
He don't feel like
no military cat to me.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.134
No way, no how.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.007
What makes you say that?

29:08.094 --> 29:10.836
The way he carry himself
while he under attack.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.315
Yeah.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.882
Bump, I-I'm
straight with that.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.406
Look, when he looked at me,
h-he looked at me

29:16.493 --> 29:19.061
like he ain't never had a gun
pointed at him before.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.368
I mean, anybody's gonna run, right?

29:21.455 --> 29:23.239
But if you ever been in combat,

29:23.326 --> 29:24.501
you don't run
the way this dude was runnin'.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.025
- Hell, no.
- How is that?

29:26.112 --> 29:28.984
Turnin' back,
lookin' over his shoulder.

29:29.071 --> 29:32.422
Anyone knows when you getting
shot at, you never look back.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.294
- Never look back.
- Never look back.

29:34.381 --> 29:38.037
Now, we fucked up for sure,
ain't no doubt.

29:38.124 --> 29:40.430
But if Battle told you
this dude was military,

29:40.517 --> 29:42.955
I think he's a fuckin' liar.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.873
And I'm sorry, Bump.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.310
Sorry.

30:04.106 --> 30:07.893
I was looking for the placement
of our "Get out the Vote" ads

30:07.980 --> 30:10.025
when I saw it,
called you right away.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.506
"HARYOU Executive Director
Mayme Johnson

30:12.593 --> 30:16.075
is sparking questions from
sources inside the organization

30:16.162 --> 30:18.033
about her role as director,

30:18.120 --> 30:20.949
given her husband's
suspected criminal activities.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.038
The sources wish
to remain anonymous

30:23.125 --> 30:25.084
for fear of retribution.

30:25.171 --> 30:29.175
Many people worry
that personal financial gain

30:29.262 --> 30:30.959
might be motivating."

30:37.096 --> 30:39.533
Well, at least we got placement
for our voting rights ad.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.504
<i>As-salamu alaykum,</i> Malcolm.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.159
<i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

30:57.246 --> 31:01.642
Good news. The court will decide
your case tomorrow,

31:01.729 --> 31:03.949
and I'm certain it
will be in your favor.

31:04.036 --> 31:06.255
That's wonderful.

31:06.342 --> 31:11.086
So soon you'll be on your way,
and I'll be out of yours.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.436
Dr. Azzam.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.526
Um...

31:16.613 --> 31:19.051
I hope I haven't
offended you in any way.

31:23.229 --> 31:27.929
I am grateful for your help
and your hospitality.

31:36.068 --> 31:41.073
When I was a boy, just--
just six years old,

31:41.160 --> 31:45.251
a group of white men snatched
my father from his home,

31:45.338 --> 31:47.253
tied him to the railroad,

31:47.340 --> 31:50.212
and let a train
slice him in two.

31:55.217 --> 31:58.525
After that, my-- my mother
suffered a nervous breakdown

31:58.612 --> 32:01.006
and was sent to an asylum.

32:01.093 --> 32:04.357
Eventually, she didn't
even recognize me.

32:08.491 --> 32:12.017
Dr. Azzam, I don't believe
all white people are evil.

32:14.236 --> 32:17.109
But in my life...

32:17.196 --> 32:21.156
I have never known kindness,

32:21.243 --> 32:24.725
humanity or empathy

32:24.812 --> 32:27.641
from anyone
with your skin color.

32:30.687 --> 32:33.168
When you're on the Hajj,

32:33.255 --> 32:36.258
you will be praying with Muslims
of all complexions.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.392
So I'm told.

32:39.479 --> 32:43.222
And they will treat you
as their brother, as I do.

32:43.309 --> 32:46.486
In Islam,
there is no skin color,

32:46.573 --> 32:51.056
just human being
and faith in God.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.717
With all due respect, Bumpy,

33:00.804 --> 33:03.720
I'm an idiot for even being
seen with you right now.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.593
I understand.
I appreciate it, though.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.769
But you and me have
always been straight.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.079
Let's keep this short.
What'd you find?

33:14.166 --> 33:20.085
This guy Madera, if that's
the guy you're looking for,

33:20.172 --> 33:22.696
has a very unusual past.

33:22.783 --> 33:24.567
How so?

33:24.654 --> 33:26.221
He don't have one.

33:26.308 --> 33:29.355
I can't find
his Social Security number.

33:29.442 --> 33:33.228
I can't find a work history or
any reports of previous crimes.

33:33.315 --> 33:34.577
What about military service?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.666
Mnh.

33:36.753 --> 33:42.150
I called his last employer,
read them the riot act.

33:43.151 --> 33:45.240
They gave me
this address in Harlem.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.115
Here's the thing.

33:50.202 --> 33:54.554
A guy with such a recent history
and no back history

33:54.641 --> 33:56.295
usually means one thing.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.339
What's that?

33:57.426 --> 33:58.384
CIA.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.260
Thanks.

34:09.569 --> 34:12.267
- Appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

What is it about this Madera
that you're not telling me?

35:26.428 --> 35:29.388
I told you. He's my enemy.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.825
Your enemy works for the CIA?

35:31.912 --> 35:37.613
The CIA is a very large
organization with many facets.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.398

35:39.485 --> 35:41.269

35:43.532 --> 35:47.754

35:47.841 --> 35:50.757
I didn't fuckin'
ask you questions

35:50.844 --> 35:52.933
about your motive or loyalty.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.717
Now you wanna question mine?

35:54.804 --> 35:58.373
You're hiding something from me.
I'll find out what it is.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.554
I envy you.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.688

leave sometimes.

36:52.775 --> 36:56.649
You are doing such
important work here, Mayme.

36:56.736 --> 36:58.346
I'm proud of you.

36:58.433 --> 37:01.001
You read the paper.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.308

is going to be tainted.

37:03.395 --> 37:06.441
I just-- I can't
get away from it.

37:06.528 --> 37:07.703
I don't know what to do.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.402
Don't give up.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.881
And don't worry about
what they say in the paper.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.840
They don't know you.

37:13.927 --> 37:17.974
Powell's enemies in Congress
can use me as a talking point.

37:18.061 --> 37:20.499
I could single-handedly derail
the Voting Rights Act

37:20.586 --> 37:21.500
all because...

37:23.632 --> 37:25.417
Because of Bumpy.

37:29.508 --> 37:34.339
For the first time in my life...

37:36.036 --> 37:38.473
I feel that I resent him.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.391
I've never felt that before.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.439
It scares me.

37:47.526 --> 37:49.310
That's natural.

37:52.008 --> 37:55.403
Look, I didn't choose my father,

37:55.490 --> 37:59.407
but I found a way to live
with the things he does...

38:01.496 --> 38:03.803
and to love him just the same.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.504
Thank you.

You don't drink
or you won't drink?

41:32.751 --> 41:34.622
What difference does it make?

41:34.709 --> 41:38.713
I'd like to know
if you're bullshitting me.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.151
You seem like the kind of man
who only hears what he wants,

41:42.238 --> 41:44.502
so whatever I say,
it doesn't matter.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.636
I can understand you
thinking that.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.290

41:53.293 --> 41:54.903
Let me guess.

41:57.863 --> 42:00.169
You hate my guts.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.998
You blame men like me

42:03.085 --> 42:07.002
for everything
that's gone wrong in your life.

42:07.089 --> 42:10.266
You think I'm just
another goombah

42:10.353 --> 42:13.748
like your father
and his friends.

42:13.835 --> 42:18.710
You're thinking
that if I were to die suddenly,

42:18.797 --> 42:24.672
right here at this table,
you'd feel tremendous relief,

42:24.759 --> 42:27.327
even joy.

42:27.414 --> 42:29.329
How'd I do?

42:30.765 --> 42:32.767
Gotta hand it to you.

42:32.854 --> 42:35.727
You are a mind reader.

42:39.121 --> 42:45.824
Your father backed me
to be head of my own family.

42:45.911 --> 42:50.698
I owe him a debt of loyalty
I could never repay.

42:52.091 --> 42:55.964
And part of that
is protecting you.

42:57.096 --> 42:59.054
What do you say?

42:59.141 --> 43:01.056

Lady, are you out of your mind?

43:22.861 --> 43:24.340
Adam, it's
the right thing to do.

43:24.427 --> 43:25.777
Did you put her up to this?

43:25.864 --> 43:28.257
No, I did not.
It was her decision.

43:28.344 --> 43:29.911
But I could not agree
with it more.

43:29.998 --> 43:31.347
Mayme...

43:31.434 --> 43:33.219
Look, this controversy
is not worth

43:33.306 --> 43:34.916
the damage it can do to HARYOU.

43:35.003 --> 43:37.049

It's not about me.

43:37.136 --> 43:40.095

43:40.182 --> 43:41.140
I do not accept
this resignation.

43:41.227 --> 43:42.750
Adam--

43:42.837 --> 43:45.361
We are under enough
scrutiny as it is.

43:45.448 --> 43:46.972
The Harlem
Leadership Committee

43:47.059 --> 43:48.713
already feels we're
illegally constituted.

43:48.800 --> 43:51.150
That's right, so the press
will look up the asshole

43:51.237 --> 43:52.325
of anybody who takes this job.

43:52.412 --> 43:55.067
Adam, as it is,

43:55.154 --> 43:56.721
you're probably gonna have
to make a statement

43:56.808 --> 43:58.723
in support of her stepping down.

43:58.810 --> 44:00.333
Oh, not a chance in hell.

44:00.420 --> 44:02.727
If this story continues,
it'll weaken the program.

44:02.814 --> 44:04.424
The perception <i>matters.</i>

44:05.164 --> 44:08.036
I thought you were
a fighter, Mayme.

44:08.123 --> 44:12.084

I would be honored

45:16.888 --> 45:21.806
if you would make the pilgrimage
with me, as my guide.

45:21.893 --> 45:23.895
There is so much
about traditional Islam

45:23.982 --> 45:25.810
I wish to learn,
if you would teach me.

45:27.202 --> 45:29.161

You work for the CIA?

46:23.606 --> 46:25.870
Of course not.

46:25.957 --> 46:28.437
Battle is the one
who was working with the CIA.

46:29.961 --> 46:32.180
Battle said you had
his family killed.

46:34.095 --> 46:36.576
I just voiced concern

46:36.663 --> 46:39.318
that Jose Battle
and his greedy fuckin' family,

46:39.405 --> 46:42.103
they stole land and money
from the Cuban people.

46:42.190 --> 46:46.194
Castro, he took revenge
on behalf of the people.

46:48.370 --> 46:50.895
Revenge on innocent women
and children.

46:57.423 --> 47:00.121
War's ugly,

47:00.208 --> 47:03.385
and their death
was decreed by the people.

47:15.180 --> 47:17.095
You found him.

47:17.182 --> 47:18.531
Yeah, I did.

47:18.618 --> 47:21.186
But you did not kill him.

47:21.273 --> 47:23.101
I don't kill for the CIA.

47:23.188 --> 47:25.320
The question is, why do you?

47:25.407 --> 47:27.192
This man is a murderer
and a thief,

47:27.279 --> 47:28.541
a corrupt cop who stole
from his own people.

47:28.628 --> 47:30.238
You're a fuckin' liar!

47:30.325 --> 47:32.501
You didn't tell me about
the CIA. I wanna know why.

47:34.112 --> 47:35.896
Because I didn't
wanna involve you

47:35.983 --> 47:37.942
in certain aspects of
my business, for your own sake.

47:38.029 --> 47:39.552
I didn't sign up
to be a hit man

47:39.639 --> 47:41.467
for the U.S. government, alright?

47:41.554 --> 47:44.992
That's too bad.
There's much to be gained.

47:45.079 --> 47:46.951
Let me show you something.

48:06.274 --> 48:09.103
This is what the CIA
can do for us.

48:09.190 --> 48:12.019
This is where you get
your M-16s,

48:12.106 --> 48:13.151
direct government issue?

48:13.238 --> 48:15.066
Brand-new.

48:16.632 --> 48:18.330
These will help us
fend off the Italians

48:18.417 --> 48:21.072
once we get
our new shipment of dope.

48:21.159 --> 48:23.378
And help you storm
the beaches of Cuba again?

48:24.423 --> 48:26.555
You think it's foolish
to fight for one's homeland?

48:26.642 --> 48:27.992
No.

48:28.079 --> 48:30.081
You've helped me
fight for mine.

48:30.168 --> 48:32.126
I just don't trust the CIA.

48:32.213 --> 48:35.086
That's your choice.

48:35.173 --> 48:37.044
But I'm sure Joe Colombo
won't have any problem

48:37.131 --> 48:39.133
with where these guns came from.

48:47.402 --> 48:48.621
Bumpy.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.319
Get up. Come on.

48:51.406 --> 48:53.669
I asked you for a favor.

48:55.410 --> 48:57.282
Now you have to decide, man.

48:57.369 --> 49:01.242
Are we partners or not?

49:01.329 --> 49:06.117
I'm a man of my word,
and I keep my promises.

49:10.251 --> 49:11.687
You better keep yours.

49:27.442 --> 49:29.531
There's the afternoon prayer.

49:29.618 --> 49:33.057
You may go to your room and pray
if you wish, Malcolm.

49:33.144 --> 49:36.147
I will not be offended.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.589
Dr. Azzam.

49:47.158 --> 49:51.379
If I may, I'd like to stay
and pray with you.

49:53.381 --> 49:57.081
That would be
the honor of my life.

50:06.394 --> 50:09.354
I am so grateful to Allah
we have met.

50:11.486 --> 50:13.140
As am I.
