WEBVTT

00:24.791 --> 00:26.125
Hey, don't overcook mine.

00:26.208 --> 00:31.000
I know. Knock the moo out of it
and hold it over a candle, right?

00:31.083 --> 00:32.333
The bloodier, the better.

00:32.416 --> 00:33.416
Not for my stomach.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.500
Unfortunately, our daughter
got your delicate tummy too.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.583
She's outgrown most of it. Thank goodness.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.416
Becca and dairy will never be friends.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.833
You know,
there are worse things to be in life.

00:46.916 --> 00:47.791
Yeah?

00:55.875 --> 00:57.750
I can't believe she's almost 18.

00:57.833 --> 01:00.500
Yeah. You know, that makes us just about--

01:00.583 --> 01:01.625
Shush your mouth.

01:03.958 --> 01:05.625
You think she's still a virgin?

01:08.291 --> 01:10.458
What?
You never think about stuff like that?

01:10.541 --> 01:11.625
No.

01:11.708 --> 01:14.083
For the record,
if she wasn't she would tell us.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.875
Really? Did you tell your parents?

01:17.958 --> 01:18.791
No.

01:20.416 --> 01:22.708
My parents weren't cool, like us.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.791
-You're delusional.
-Why? Because I trust our daughter?

01:25.875 --> 01:27.583
No, because you think our daughter

01:28.541 --> 01:30.208
doesn't have any secrets from us.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.833
You know, you always do this.

01:32.583 --> 01:36.166
You take things and you twist them around
and you make it seem so suspicious.

01:36.250 --> 01:39.291
All I'm saying is don't be so naive.

01:39.375 --> 01:40.666
Which reminds me…

01:43.625 --> 01:45.333
don't you think she suspects something?

01:45.416 --> 01:46.500
She heard us arguing.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.416
Maybe.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.750
So when are we going to tell her?

01:51.416 --> 01:54.208
I thought we agreed. After graduation.

01:54.291 --> 01:56.916
'Cause nothing is better than,
"Hey, congrats on the diploma."

01:57.000 --> 01:59.666
"And by the way,
your mom and I are getting divorced."

02:00.416 --> 02:02.125
There's never a good time for this, Lee.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.416
<i>Did you think</i>
<i>you could fool me?</i>

02:05.500 --> 02:07.791
Becca's
barely talking to me now.

02:08.750 --> 02:09.750
What are you saying?

02:09.833 --> 02:11.916
<i>I will always know you.</i>

02:22.333 --> 02:23.708
I am impressed.

02:23.791 --> 02:27.250
You beat Gaia. That is no easy task.

02:27.333 --> 02:28.833
She was my best.

02:42.875 --> 02:47.541
I have already fought this fight with you
in my mind's eye a million times.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.833
This isn't your imagination,
it's the real thing.

02:51.916 --> 02:53.833
I don't want to kill you.

02:53.916 --> 02:56.125
I just want to get my daughter back.

02:56.208 --> 02:57.708
You cannot defeat me.

02:57.791 --> 02:59.916
I know all your Russian fighting styles.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.375
Every move you make.

03:01.458 --> 03:04.708
Sambo. Systema. ARB.

03:05.666 --> 03:07.916
-But you don't know Jersey.

03:16.875 --> 03:17.791
I'm sorry.

03:18.625 --> 03:21.041
But you shouldn't
have fucked with my daughter.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.958
Promise me you won't hurt Becca.

03:31.541 --> 03:33.750
What do you think I am, a monster?

03:34.791 --> 03:36.000
She knows nothing.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.833
It does not matter what she knows.
Only what she is.

03:39.916 --> 03:41.375
An innocent girl.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.583
She is your blood.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.708
I'll come back to you.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.416
Do whatever you want.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.083
Just leave her be. Please.

03:55.750 --> 03:59.291
You betrayed your birthright, Anya.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.041
Worry not.

04:05.583 --> 04:08.083
Becca is going to fulfil your destiny.

04:11.875 --> 04:12.958
No.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.000
No.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.333
No!

04:34.166 --> 04:35.541
I need you to disappear

04:35.625 --> 04:38.458
before people start asking questions
that I cannot answer.

04:38.541 --> 04:39.875
We are not done, Ohana.

04:39.958 --> 04:41.500
Diego might know who he is.

04:41.583 --> 04:46.875
And if we don't find Gideon soon,
a lot more people are going to die.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.583
-I will question Diego at the station.
-We don't have time.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.625
Diego, Mommy's here.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.083
It's okay, <i>cariño.</i>

04:55.166 --> 04:56.875
Please let me through.

04:56.958 --> 04:59.041
I need to see my son.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.250
<i>Por favor.</i>

05:00.333 --> 05:03.458
Ohana, you need to let me speak to Diego.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.666
-But with his mother.
-Diego!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.708
I told you, I know nothing.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.458
Everything is going to be fine.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.375
Mommy's here, baby.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.666
But listen to me, Diego.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.000
I need you to tell these people the truth.

05:22.208 --> 05:25.500
And even if you have sinned, I love you.

05:26.791 --> 05:29.666
Because you are my son, and believe me…

05:31.208 --> 05:33.708
it's never too late
for God to forgive.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.666
And that road to salvation…

05:37.583 --> 05:38.791
starts here.

05:39.458 --> 05:41.083
In this moment, okay?

05:44.833 --> 05:45.750
Diego.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.916
Did you ever meet a man named Gideon?

05:50.208 --> 05:51.625
No.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.916
Did your uncles ever speak of him?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.250
What is it?

06:00.333 --> 06:05.291
Uh, I heard my uncle Felipe
speaking to this Gideon once.

06:07.708 --> 06:12.000
But this Gideon was a woman.

06:32.541 --> 06:34.166
Kid never stood a chance.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.583
And now he's going to pay
a very high price.

06:37.666 --> 06:40.875
-Unless we find Gideon.
-We are not any closer.

06:41.541 --> 06:43.541
-I've got to take this.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.083
-<i>Chauncey--</i>
-Jenny, we did it.

06:48.166 --> 06:50.458
We stopped
the prime minister's assassination.

06:50.541 --> 06:51.666
Gideon is on the run.

06:52.541 --> 06:55.708
-Gideon has Becca.
-Wait, what? How do you know that?

06:55.791 --> 06:57.750
<i>There's no time, just listen to me.</i>

06:58.750 --> 07:02.041
You have to get to the Madrid Arena

07:05.958 --> 07:08.250
and see what Gideon
has in store for Becca.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.750
<i>Jenny, where are you?</i>

07:09.833 --> 07:10.875
Forget about me.

07:12.583 --> 07:13.875
<i>You hear me, Chauncey?</i>

07:22.083 --> 07:23.416
Feeling better?

07:24.666 --> 07:28.500
Uh, yes. Thanks for letting me
crash at your place last night.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.083
-I am happy that I could help.
-Me too.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.833
I just needed to get my head together.

07:33.916 --> 07:36.041
The last few days have been so sus.

07:36.125 --> 07:37.916
Dostoevsky says,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.083
"The darker the night,
the brighter the stars."

07:41.916 --> 07:42.750
I love that.

07:42.833 --> 07:47.166
And I'm quite sure your mother
is doing the very best that she can.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.750
You don't know my mother.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.375
I know that mothers worry.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.041
You will one day too.

07:53.833 --> 07:56.791
Give your mother a call
and let her know you are okay.

07:58.708 --> 08:03.833
I believe
you are destined for great things, Becca.

08:04.416 --> 08:06.583
Do not be afraid of who you are.

08:07.541 --> 08:09.666
Embrace it, use it.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.458
Never be ashamed of it.

08:13.916 --> 08:17.458
<i>All participants to their staging areas.</i>

08:41.416 --> 08:44.416
-Where the hell have you been?
-With a friend.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.875
Your mom find you?
'Cause she was totally losing her shit.

08:49.958 --> 08:51.291
Yeah. I know.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.541
I just needed some time to myself.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.166
My mom, she'll be fine.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.375
Okay. Well, I'm glad you're okay.

09:04.750 --> 09:05.708
Thanks.

09:07.166 --> 09:10.916
Um… Well, good luck out there.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.916
Yeah, you too.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.375
Look. You're welcome.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.708
Now save the world on your own,
and that starts with losing my number.

09:43.791 --> 09:44.666
<i>Jenny's in trouble.</i>

09:44.750 --> 09:48.458
She called me from a burner phone,
which I'm guessing is one of ours.

09:48.541 --> 09:49.833
And you want me to track it?

09:49.916 --> 09:52.583
<i>I swear to you, it's the last thing</i>
<i>I'll ever ask you to do.</i>

10:03.250 --> 10:04.083
I got it.

10:05.625 --> 10:06.625
Damn.

10:06.708 --> 10:07.958
What?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.916
It's where Becca's team's been practicing.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.916
Okay, listen to me, Chris. Thank you.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.041
Just go get our girl, man.

10:18.666 --> 10:23.000
Ohana, my asset is telling me that Gideon
is targeting someone at another location.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.125
-The Madrid Arena.
-Your asset, Jennifer Franklin?

10:26.208 --> 10:29.541
Yes. She's also concerned
for the safety of her daughter Rebecca,

10:29.625 --> 10:32.208
who's participating
in a skating competition at the arena.

10:32.291 --> 10:35.583
I cannot afford to spread
my resources thin, chasing after--

10:35.666 --> 10:38.083
Ohana, this is real.
I need you and whoever you've got

10:38.166 --> 10:40.083
to get over there and lock the place down.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.916
Please. You have to trust me.

10:45.916 --> 10:47.333
Where are you going?

10:47.416 --> 10:48.625
To save Jenny.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.250
So good to see you again.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.625
The pleasure is all mine, my dear.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.250
Let's go and catch the senator.

11:19.208 --> 11:23.541
Senator, this is Svetlana Markova.

11:23.625 --> 11:26.791
She owns
the Palacio de Hielo ice skating rink.

11:26.875 --> 11:30.750
It is an honor to shake the hand
of the future leader of the free world.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.875
Well, we're not there yet.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.458
And, uh, unless my poll numbers
go up in Ohio,

11:36.541 --> 11:38.125
I may be looking for a job.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.666
You hiring down at the rink?

11:41.083 --> 11:42.541
It's really nice to meet you.

11:42.625 --> 11:43.833
Nice to meet you.

11:43.916 --> 11:46.416
<i>Everyone please take your seats.</i>

11:46.500 --> 11:48.833
<i>The competition is about to begin.</i>

11:58.916 --> 11:59.916
Jenny.

12:02.375 --> 12:03.541
Holy shit.

12:04.833 --> 12:05.708
Jenny.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.125
What are you doing here? I told you…

12:10.208 --> 12:11.666
Why aren't you healing?

12:11.750 --> 12:14.625
My power is only as strong as I am.
And I've lost too much blood.

12:14.708 --> 12:16.791
-We gotta get you to a hospital.
-No.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.583
Help me get to Becca. She needs me.

12:21.791 --> 12:22.791
God damn it.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.125
All right, it's okay. I've got you.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.166
You're okay. I've got you.

12:38.708 --> 12:40.583
Good news is
the bullet went right through,

12:40.666 --> 12:43.000
but I need to find a way to close you up.

12:48.041 --> 12:49.458
Use that to close me up.

12:49.541 --> 12:50.500
What?

12:50.583 --> 12:51.500
The stapler.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.208
That's fucking crazy.

12:54.291 --> 12:56.375
We flew past "crazy" a long time ago.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.500
The pain alone
will probably put you into shock.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.708
I really hope
you're not like this with the ladies.

13:01.791 --> 13:03.500
All talk and no action.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.750
Oh, my God.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.541
All right, fine.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.125
This is really gonna fucking hurt.

13:13.208 --> 13:15.166
Fucking do it before I change my mind.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.750
Diego says Gideon is a woman.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.291
Her name is Svetlana Markova.

13:43.666 --> 13:46.166
She's my, uh, former handler.

13:47.291 --> 13:49.541
The person
I've been chasing for the last two years

13:49.625 --> 13:51.541
turns out to be your old boss.

13:51.625 --> 13:52.958
What are the odds, Jenny?

13:53.041 --> 13:55.291
-Pretty good actually.
-I'm not following.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.750
You said
a black ops agent sold you my info?

13:57.833 --> 13:59.416
Svetlana? Why?

13:59.500 --> 14:02.541
Let's just say she's trying
to kill two birds with one stone.

14:02.625 --> 14:03.750
Why should I believe you?

14:05.625 --> 14:08.291
She's the reason
I went into the cold in the first place.

14:11.291 --> 14:13.375
Miss Orlov, are you all right?

14:14.125 --> 14:15.500
Open the door immediately!

14:23.458 --> 14:25.708
Code Silver. Code Silver.

14:25.791 --> 14:27.416
Lockdown.

14:29.625 --> 14:30.750
The girl…

14:31.375 --> 14:32.458
the window…

14:33.041 --> 14:34.583
she jumped.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.500
Scramble perimeter guards.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.708
And we need immediate medical assistance
in the upstairs living quarters.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.833
It is a bit crowded in here.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.583
Her vitals are dropping.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.458
-She is dying?
-Yes.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.583
Then let us complete the mission.

15:37.083 --> 15:40.083
Svetlana assassinates the prime minister
and frames you for everything?

15:40.833 --> 15:43.875
I don't think Svetlana was ever interested
in killing the prime minister.

15:43.958 --> 15:46.250
That attack
was merely meant as a distraction

15:46.333 --> 15:48.666
to force law enforcement
to look the other way.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.000
Like they're doing
over at the museum right now.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.500
Which means that Svetlana's
real target is at the arena.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.291
-<i>Ohana.</i>
-Chauncey.

16:54.375 --> 16:56.791
I believe I have eyes
on Miss Franklin's daughter.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.041
Is she all right?

16:58.125 --> 17:01.583
<i>Yes, she appears to be fine.</i>
<i>She's about to begin her performance.</i>

17:01.666 --> 17:02.708
We're seconds away.

17:02.791 --> 17:04.958
Make sure
you don't take your eyes off Becca.

17:05.041 --> 17:06.625
I assure you, I won't.

17:15.083 --> 17:18.083
<i>Next, from the United States,</i>

17:18.166 --> 17:19.500
<i>Rebecca Franklin.</i>

18:31.833 --> 18:33.208
<i>What a show!</i>

18:33.291 --> 18:37.583
<i>Rebecca Franklin has just skated</i>
<i>the performance of her life.</i>

18:37.666 --> 18:40.750
<i>Amazing, absolutely impressive.</i>

18:41.708 --> 18:47.125
<i>Who would have expected this</i>
<i>from the debut outing of this US skater?</i>

18:52.083 --> 18:54.166
That's what I'm talking about.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.541
Don't know where that came from,
but I'll take it, Becca.

19:04.416 --> 19:06.666

<i>And Rebecca Franklin did it!</i>

19:07.500 --> 19:10.125
<i>She takes a bronze.</i>

19:10.208 --> 19:11.833
<i>This is her first medal.</i>

19:12.666 --> 19:13.666
<i>Amazing.</i>

19:16.833 --> 19:18.458
<i>Congratulations to all skaters.</i>

19:18.541 --> 19:21.458
-Where is Becca?
-The arena is secure. Everything is fine.

19:21.541 --> 19:24.333
<i>The gold medal</i>
<i>goes to Madison Davis.</i>

19:24.416 --> 19:27.250
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>making the medal presentation this evening</i>

19:27.333 --> 19:28.833
<i>will be our very special guest.</i>

19:29.416 --> 19:32.458
<i>Please welcome United States Senator</i>
<i>and Presidential Candidate,</i>

19:33.416 --> 19:34.791
<i>Warren Richardson.</i>

19:36.083 --> 19:38.250
The senator.
He's Svetlana's real target.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.500
What is he doing here?

19:39.583 --> 19:41.500
He was in Paris for a trade summit.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.166
And clearly,
he couldn't pass up a good photo op.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.875
There's barely enough security.
The senator is a sitting duck.

19:46.958 --> 19:49.791
Just remember, with Svetlana,
nothing is ever as it seems.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.375
What are you doing?

20:10.708 --> 20:12.458
-Becca, no!
-Jenny, no!

20:14.958 --> 20:16.750
<i>We have a live shooter.</i>

20:16.833 --> 20:18.250
I got you.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.333
<i>Remain calm.</i>

20:19.416 --> 20:22.500
<i>Walk to the nearest exit. Remain calm.</i>

20:23.625 --> 20:25.333
<i>Everybody, off the ice.</i>

20:27.791 --> 20:29.458
Jenny! Out of the way!

20:29.541 --> 20:31.666
<i>Remain calm.</i>
<i>Walk to the nearest exit.</i>

20:31.750 --> 20:32.791
Jenny!

20:32.875 --> 20:34.916
<i>Does anyone</i>
<i>have eyes on the shooter?</i>

20:35.583 --> 20:38.708
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>anyone have eyes on the shooter?</i>

20:39.208 --> 20:43.166
I have eyes on the target.
Female. Brown hair. Orange coat.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.500
Can't get a clean shot.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.833
I lost the target.
She's moving down the stairs.

20:54.833 --> 20:58.291
Quick! This way.
Down the hall. Keep going.

20:58.375 --> 20:59.625
Move!

21:04.166 --> 21:05.250
Move!

21:16.916 --> 21:18.083
<i>Remain calm.</i>

21:21.833 --> 21:22.916
Bolt that door.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.041
Package is secure.
We're going to need an extraction.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.041
Yeah, that's affirmative, sir.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.375
Sir, stop. Please stop.

22:21.041 --> 22:22.583
Calm down.

22:22.666 --> 22:24.375
Hey, I'm with Europol.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.500
Listen, we need to get everybody
upstairs and out of the arena now.

22:27.583 --> 22:28.875
Okay.

22:29.666 --> 22:30.625
Becca.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.625
Keep moving.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.333
I am so sorry, honey.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.583
Jenny?

23:21.375 --> 23:22.375
Jenny!

23:23.583 --> 23:24.750
What just happened?

23:26.833 --> 23:28.500
Becca was being controlled by Svetlana.

23:29.291 --> 23:30.916
I had to break her hold.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.333
Lidia Orsorio described
how the gunshots at the church

23:35.416 --> 23:36.875
snapped her out of her daze.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.875
And I saw the same thing
happen when I shot Damían.

23:40.958 --> 23:43.083
So I shot the gun near her ear.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.666
Where's the senator?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.041
Secret Service protocols

23:49.125 --> 23:52.166
require that the senator
be removed to a secure location.

23:53.541 --> 23:56.083
Svetlana never wanted
the assassination to be successful.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.416
-It's why she had Becca do it.
-Just another diversion.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.708
Exactly. When the senator
was put into lockdown,

24:03.791 --> 24:07.875
Svetlana was already there waiting,
and since he is of no use to her dead,

24:07.958 --> 24:11.708
she's using
all this chaos to hijack his mind.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.583
Even if that's true,
police and Secret Service

24:14.666 --> 24:17.000
have the streets sealed off.
She can't go anywhere.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.750
We find the nearest helipad,
and we find Svetlana.

24:25.041 --> 24:27.041
You mean like the Centro Colón next door?

24:28.500 --> 24:29.916
-Take care of Becca.
-I will.

24:38.125 --> 24:39.083
Jenny?

24:40.791 --> 24:41.916
Do whatever you have to do.

24:54.916 --> 24:56.666
What have you done to me?

24:58.791 --> 25:00.291
Made you extraordinary.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.833
You made me a monster.

25:06.458 --> 25:07.708
Do not be so dramatic.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.500
Why must I go through with this?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Because you must.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.541
Now I want you to make sure
to keep your head up at all times.

25:45.625 --> 25:48.541
-Maintain eye contact.
-I know.

25:49.125 --> 25:52.416
Yes, you do. Because it's not as if you
haven't been through all of this before.

25:53.791 --> 25:55.833
I am going to tell you
something I should not.

25:57.541 --> 26:00.958
You are about to learn your next mission.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.958
So act surprised.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.083
Happy birthday, Anya!

26:27.875 --> 26:29.208
My baby, look at you.

26:29.708 --> 26:31.416
You left for boarding school a girl,

26:31.500 --> 26:34.791
and now, you return almost a woman.

26:35.791 --> 26:37.583
I missed you too, Papa.

26:38.333 --> 26:39.250
Grandma!

26:39.333 --> 26:42.041
My honey, my joy.

26:42.125 --> 26:43.666
She is your spitting image.

26:43.750 --> 26:46.041
My darling baby!

26:46.125 --> 26:49.041
You grew to be so pretty! My little Anya!

26:49.125 --> 26:52.916
My darling little granddaughter!

26:53.000 --> 26:54.916
She looks like you when we first met.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.208
Even prettier.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.125
You are so nice!

27:00.208 --> 27:02.833
We are both so blessed
to have such a wonderful daughter.

27:02.916 --> 27:04.958
You grew to be so pretty!

27:05.750 --> 27:07.166
Happy birthday, Ptichka.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.625
That is my girl.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.583
You always were full of surprises,

27:34.666 --> 27:37.708
like how quickly
you abandoned your country.

27:38.625 --> 27:40.500
How easily you abandoned me.

27:42.541 --> 27:44.000
I did what I had to do.

27:44.083 --> 27:47.791
Did you ever wonder
what became of Svetlana,

27:47.875 --> 27:50.583
all those years ago,
when you went into the cold?

27:54.791 --> 27:56.166
I was arrested.

27:57.125 --> 28:00.750
Prosecuted
for criminal disloyalty to the state.

28:01.708 --> 28:06.416
And then, I was sent to Siberia.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.375
You got what you deserved.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.125
Perhaps.

28:16.875 --> 28:18.666
So all this, for what?

28:19.541 --> 28:23.666
Revenge against whom? For what?

28:23.750 --> 28:24.750
A correction.

28:25.958 --> 28:28.041
To put the world
back to the way it should be.

28:28.666 --> 28:34.500
Soon, the senator will become
the president of the United States.

28:35.666 --> 28:40.458
And maybe I launch
an American missile into,

28:41.833 --> 28:44.625
perhaps, St. Petersburg.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.958
Starting World War III.

28:48.958 --> 28:53.666
But this time,
Russia is going to be the good guys.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.083
You're insane.

28:57.666 --> 29:00.666
That is what they say
about most visionaries.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.208
But nevertheless…

29:03.916 --> 29:07.166
Find intel
on the Leutenant Colonel. Understood.

29:07.916 --> 29:08.916
Understood!

29:09.625 --> 29:12.291
…the card has already been dealt.

29:14.916 --> 29:16.958
It stops when I kill you.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.791
Target is armed and dangerous.

29:21.875 --> 29:23.625
I repeat. Target is armed and dangerous.

29:24.208 --> 29:27.458
If you were going to kill me,
you would have done so already.

29:28.458 --> 29:30.791
How could you
do this to my daughter? To your--

29:30.875 --> 29:35.666
If only you knew
what Becca truly thinks of you.

29:35.750 --> 29:40.375
She and I share a connection now…

29:45.666 --> 29:49.958
that can never be broken.

29:54.875 --> 29:58.083
Abort mission.
The Lieutenant Colonel is down.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Mama…

30:27.083 --> 30:29.541
There is more good news to share.

30:29.625 --> 30:30.500
What is this?

30:30.583 --> 30:31.625
Take a look.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.041
Okay, come on.

30:41.083 --> 30:41.916
Come on.

30:44.250 --> 30:49.083
To Anya, who has been accepted
to NYU in the United States of America.

30:49.666 --> 30:51.041
Hooray!

30:55.750 --> 30:56.916
Congratulations!

31:02.750 --> 31:05.083
<i>You don't think. You act!</i>

31:05.166 --> 31:07.208
<i>You should have killed him.</i>

31:07.291 --> 31:09.041
<i>Do you even know your part anymore?</i>

31:09.125 --> 31:10.916
<i>To serve the Motherland with honor.</i>

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
I see and hear everything.
I know more than you know yourself.

31:14.750 --> 31:17.791
<i>Love is not freedom, Ptichka.</i>

31:17.875 --> 31:21.250
<i>Real freedom only comes from raw power.</i>

31:21.333 --> 31:23.083
Initiate. Omega Protocol.

31:23.166 --> 31:24.333
I can't.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.333
It felt like I was losing control.

31:41.416 --> 31:42.500
I get that.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.708
I think part of it
was the divorce.

31:48.083 --> 31:51.333
But the other part of it was
just me trying to figure some shit out.

31:52.500 --> 31:56.666
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm still trying to figure some shit out.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.375
Yeah, I hear that.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.333
Speaking of which, how's your ear?

32:02.416 --> 32:06.291
Tender. But it's getting better.

32:07.208 --> 32:08.625
Still no idea what happened?

32:10.916 --> 32:13.250
Honestly, I can barely remember any of it.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.000
Must be the shock.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.500
I'm so sorry, honey.

32:19.458 --> 32:20.416
I'll be fine.

32:26.666 --> 32:28.041
Why'd you cheat on Dad?

32:32.916 --> 32:35.833
I wish I had one good reason to give you.

32:37.625 --> 32:39.958
We grew apart. Bored.

32:43.875 --> 32:45.083
Self-destructive.

32:46.750 --> 32:47.916
All of the above.

32:52.291 --> 32:54.416
But I'm really sorry I hurt your dad.

32:56.125 --> 33:00.208
And I'm even more sorry
I wasn't honest with you.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.958
-I do want to ask one thing.
-Hmm?

33:10.125 --> 33:12.958
No more secrets between us, okay?

33:14.125 --> 33:15.458
-Becca…

33:23.750 --> 33:24.750
I promise.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.666
No more secrets.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.625
Okay. I love you, Mom.

33:31.708 --> 33:33.541
And I love you too, baby.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.541
Okay.

33:39.750 --> 33:40.750
Hey, Dash.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.083
Dash. Hey!

33:43.166 --> 33:44.666
-Hey, Dad.

33:49.208 --> 33:50.583
Dash.

33:50.666 --> 33:52.000
Come on, boy.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.041
Come on.

33:59.708 --> 34:00.958
Bye, Mom.

34:06.958 --> 34:09.666
I'm sure you're gonna get
plenty of pie in Atlanta.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.958
Hang on. Someone wants to say hi.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.083
Hey!

34:13.166 --> 34:16.041
<i>Hey! There's my girl.</i>
<i>How you and Becca holdin' up?</i>

34:16.125 --> 34:17.125
We're good.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.541
<i>That's what I wanna hear.</i>

34:18.625 --> 34:21.375
What are you gonna do
now you got rid of the dead weight here?

34:21.458 --> 34:23.916
<i>Man, something super boring and safe.</i>

34:24.000 --> 34:26.250
<i>Like being the IT guy at UPS.</i>

34:26.333 --> 34:27.625
I don't see that.

34:27.708 --> 34:30.041
<i>You're about to.</i>
<i>I got a cousin that works there.</i>

34:30.125 --> 34:32.500
<i>They got great benefits,</i>
<i>so I'm hitting him up.</i>

34:32.583 --> 34:36.208
Wait a minute. Does that mean
you get to wear those little brown shorts?

34:36.291 --> 34:40.541
<i>If I do, unlike you, Chauncey,</i>
<i>I got great legs, so I'm good to go.</i>

34:40.625 --> 34:43.625
You wanna call those chicken legs,
great, go right ahead.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.375
<i>I know you ain't talkin'</i>
<i>with your little duck legs,</i>

34:46.458 --> 34:48.083
<i>you be running around, waddling around.</i>

34:48.166 --> 34:50.250
<i>Jenny, just do me one favor.</i>

34:51.083 --> 34:52.333
Mmm-hmm?

34:52.416 --> 34:55.375
<i>Do not fall for this fool's cheesy moves.</i>
<i>You're way too good for him.</i>

34:55.458 --> 34:58.000
What makes you think
he's the one putting on the moves?

34:58.083 --> 35:00.666
<i>Okay. All right,</i>
<i>you know, on that note, I'm out.</i>

35:01.708 --> 35:04.083
<i>Don't call me. I'll call you. Okay?</i>

35:04.166 --> 35:06.750
<i>Like, to wish you</i>
<i>happy holidays, all right? Peace.</i>

35:06.833 --> 35:07.666
Bye.

35:07.750 --> 35:08.958
See you around, big man.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.041
Here you go.

35:16.750 --> 35:18.000
What's this?

35:18.083 --> 35:22.166
-A toast to my reinstatement in the CIA.
-Hmm.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.458
What's the other side of this coin?

35:27.333 --> 35:28.750
What does that mean?

35:28.833 --> 35:29.833
Well…

35:30.500 --> 35:32.250
You got to clear Rose.

35:35.250 --> 35:36.875
And you got your job back.

35:40.958 --> 35:42.416
I don't get my freedom, do I?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.041
I'm sorry.

35:57.125 --> 35:58.291
I tried.

35:59.583 --> 36:02.791
But you're too valuable
an asset to the company.

36:13.333 --> 36:15.916
I've lived the cover
of Jenny Franklin for so long

36:17.500 --> 36:19.208
that I completely lost myself.

36:21.291 --> 36:23.208
I tried to be a mother,

36:23.791 --> 36:24.750
a wife,

36:26.583 --> 36:28.000
a regular person.

36:30.083 --> 36:31.833
I did it for a while.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.041
But I wasn't happy.

36:38.666 --> 36:40.250
Well, if it helps,

36:41.208 --> 36:42.541
I think you're a great mom.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.208
I'm a good mom.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.833
I have a lot of work to do
to be great.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.083
Becca's gonna be leaving for college soon.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.833
And she's gonna need me less and less.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.666
I've been feeling that.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.916
And I didn't know what I was gonna do.

37:18.416 --> 37:20.166
But then, you walked into my life,

37:21.666 --> 37:25.583
and, at first, I hated your fucking guts.

37:26.875 --> 37:27.833
I know.

37:29.875 --> 37:34.791
Because you forced me
to come to terms with who I really am.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.208
And I can't shut that off again.

38:01.291 --> 38:02.458
Is this real?

38:15.458 --> 38:16.708
You tell me.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.500
<i>Yes?</i>

39:50.208 --> 39:51.666
Agent Anya Petrova.

39:52.708 --> 39:53.750
Everything is fine.

39:54.833 --> 39:55.833
It worked.
