WEBVTT

00:15.600 --> 00:17.680
-Come on, the Reds! -Come on, Izzy! That's it.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.600
-Stick together. -Come on, Izzy! Come on!

00:19.640 --> 00:21.800
-This is ridiculous! -Oh, come on, sis!

00:21.840 --> 00:23.240
When I said Caribbean, you didn't really think

00:23.280 --> 00:24.920
you'd get me on a beach, did you?

00:26.840 --> 00:28.640
-That's it, come on! -We're not done.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.600
That's it, go, go, go, sisters. You're almost there!

00:37.800 --> 00:40.400
-Come on, that's brilliant! -Well done.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.840
-Come on, Izzy! -Come on!

00:42.880 --> 00:45.760
-Push him! Just push him! -Come on!

00:45.800 --> 00:48.560
Oh, referee! You can't push...

00:50.000 --> 00:51.880
-That's it! -Oh!

00:51.920 --> 00:53.600
Come on! That's it, go!

00:53.640 --> 00:55.560
-Go, go! -BOTH: Whoo!

01:01.400 --> 01:03.160
BILL: Right, listen up, everybody.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.480
We're going to have one last exercise

01:03.200 --> 01:06.480
to finish the day.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.920
Sorry. -Ah, Izzy. She's here.

01:08.960 --> 01:11.160
-Okay. The conch game. -The conch game.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.760
You choose someone,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.240
you look them in the eye and you can say

01:12.800 --> 01:15.240
anything at all.

01:15.280 --> 01:20.240
-One condition!

01:15.280 --> 01:20.240
It must include "I like."

01:20.280 --> 01:21.840
-Stuart, you start.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.040
Okay.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.240
-Izzy. My sweetheart. -Aw!

01:30.280 --> 01:34.520
I like the way you look in combats.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.040
-ALL: Aw! -That's nice.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.400
Um...

01:40.960 --> 01:43.360
Oh, dear.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.000
I like the way you keep our company going.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.080
-Hear, hear. -I wouldn't know

01:48.040 --> 01:50.080
what we'd do without you.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.480
-Oh, thank you.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.560
Hear, hear.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.520
Dom...

01:57.560 --> 02:01.600
I like the way that you've managed to fit in.

01:57.560 --> 02:01.600
It can't have been easy.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.280
Hmm.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.680
-Um...

02:06.160 --> 02:07.200
-Ms Burgess... -Oh!

02:07.240 --> 02:09.480
I mean, um...

02:09.520 --> 02:10.880
Annette.  I, um...

02:13.000 --> 02:15.160
I like the way that even though you're the boss,

02:15.200 --> 02:17.560
you still get stuck in like everyone else.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.400
-Ah!

02:21.880 --> 02:25.680
And I like the way that my bed is calling me.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.840
-Sorry, but I'm going

02:25.720 --> 02:27.840
to call it a night,

02:27.880 --> 02:30.400
but you're all doing really, really well.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.600
Night.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.920
-Night. -Good night, Annette.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.680
I've left your drinks in the fridge.

02:38.080 --> 02:44.200
After the day you've had, I think you all deserve

02:38.080 --> 02:44.200
a treat before lights out.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.360
-Just a small one. -Down the hatch.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.080
Help!

03:06.120 --> 03:09.000
-Stuart! -Bill, Sandra's not

03:06.120 --> 03:09.000
in her shack!

03:09.040 --> 03:11.200
-SANDRA: Over here!

03:11.240 --> 03:13.160
It's this way.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.880
I've got you now. I've got you.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.720
Don't worry, we're going to support you.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.520
-Sandra, give me your hand!

03:19.560 --> 03:21.320
Come on, I've got you.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.760
I got lost. I needed the loo.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.840
I lost my torch.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.920
-Oh, my God, Sandra! -We really should play safe.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.600
Er... Go get Annette. She needs to see a doctor.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.440
There's a first-aid kit in my Jeep.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.840
-I'm such an idiot.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.840
I'm so sorry.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.800
-No, don't be silly. -Annette!

03:47.680 --> 03:48.840
Annette!

04:26.880 --> 04:29.240
Right, a birthday present for my dad.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.240
Personalised cufflinks, personalised golf clubs,

04:32.280 --> 04:35.320
personalised fishing rod... Personalised fish?

04:35.360 --> 04:36.560
That can't be right.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.640
Oh, what do you think?

04:39.680 --> 04:40.680
-Yes.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.640
I don't know. He's your dad.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.080
Eh, no, no, no.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.960
This is one of the most oxygen-producing plants

04:46.120 --> 04:48.960
on Earth.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.120
It increases brainpower by up to 30%. Proven fact.

04:52.160 --> 04:57.040
Yes? Well, take your proven fact and move it to your side

04:52.160 --> 04:57.040
of the office.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.040
-Please. -FLORENCE: Come on.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.040
He must have a hobby.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.000
Travel, cinema... Sports?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.360
Hobby, yeah. Yes. No!

05:06.720 --> 05:09.280
-He's 70.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.720
One! 71. No, two, two. 72.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.560
No, one. 71. Yes, definitely 71.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
I think.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.480
Oh, no! No, no, no. No way.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.640
-Apparently, it boosts your brainpower by 30%.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.640
-Exactly.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.080
I'm not sitting next to no hedge, man.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.440
JP: It's not a hedge. It's a shrub.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.760
A Dracaena fragrans "Massangeana."

05:31.800 --> 05:33.360
Hello? Saint Marie police station.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.040
-I don't want it. -But I can't...

05:35.080 --> 05:36.600
-I'll put it somewhere central.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.600
-Right, we'll be right there.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.880
Thank you.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.880
-I'm allergic to hedges, man. -Uh, thank you.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.800
-Take it outside. -That way.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.320
Thank you!

05:44.360 --> 05:47.440
Right, we have a dead body waiting for us.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.440
Inland.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.440
Saint Vincent National Park, let's go.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.920
GOODMAN: Single shot, close range, very efficient.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.600
Rigor mortis has set in, so time of death

06:13.640 --> 06:17.360
could be anything between 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.760
-Annette Burgess, 52. -CEO of It's-so-good.co.uk.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.320
-Yeah, it's an online

06:21.800 --> 06:25.320
ethical travel agent's.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.200
Small, but very boutique, very chic.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.960
They sell holidays for, you know, young professionals,

06:28.240 --> 06:31.960
young families.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.760
How do you call these women?

06:33.800 --> 06:37.920
Ah, <i> jolie maman.</i> Have children, don't work,

06:33.800 --> 06:37.920
go to the gym...

06:37.960 --> 06:41.040
Ah, yes, yummy mummies. So, what were they

06:37.960 --> 06:41.040
all doing here?

06:41.080 --> 06:43.920
Outdoor team-building, run by a Bill Williams.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.880
He was the one who made the call.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.640
Oh, yeah, I know Williams.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.120
He has a business running these corporate getaways.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.480
He's one of those types who spends a long and lonely

06:51.160 --> 06:54.480
life looking for themselves

06:54.520 --> 06:59.160
and end up in the middle of the Caribbean adorned

06:54.520 --> 06:59.160
in a ghastly flowery shirt.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.240
Hey, I wasn't talking about you, you know, Chief.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.600
Argh! It's easier to get into Fort Knox than this.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.600
Right!

07:08.640 --> 07:11.840
Not much of a bleed, I must say. Murder weapon?

07:11.880 --> 07:15.920
Not at the scene. But Williams owns a gun, which he keeps

07:11.880 --> 07:15.920
locked in a chest.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.600
And it went missing last night.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.280
Bullet penetrated both the covers

07:17.640 --> 07:20.280
and the nightdress.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.560
You think she was shot in her sleep?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.080
Yes, certainly seems that way, except...

07:25.600 --> 07:26.920
Earplugs.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.760
Eye mask. Untouched.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.680
Why would she bring them all this way

07:33.720 --> 07:35.520
and then not bother to use them?

07:35.560 --> 07:38.360
Yeah, but if she was awake, there's no sign of struggle

07:35.560 --> 07:38.360
anywhere.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.960
Hmm. Was anything taken?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.440
Only her mobile phone, her PA says.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.240
Diamond earrings still in her suitcase.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.160
Seems an awful lot of trouble to go to

07:46.280 --> 07:49.160
just for a mobile phone.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.640
Ah, whisky!

07:51.480 --> 07:53.840
One shot missing. One glass.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.960
This is clean. Lab, please.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.520
-Oh, God. -DWAYNE: Yes!

08:01.560 --> 08:04.880
-This must be good for you. -Yes!

08:04.920 --> 08:07.680
I did it, Chief! Let's hope it was

08:04.920 --> 08:07.680
worth it, yeah?

08:10.040 --> 08:11.120
Padded envelope?

08:15.840 --> 08:18.440
Sticky tape?

08:18.480 --> 08:22.760
Why would anyone put sticky tape in an envelope

08:18.480 --> 08:22.760
in a safe?

08:22.800 --> 08:26.080
Sir? I have finished with everyone's fingerprints.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.080
They're ready for you now.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.040
Excellent. All yours, gentlemen.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.640
Ah, good morning.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.760
Um, I'm Detective Inspector Goodman.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.840
Uh, I'd just like to put some names to faces.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.840
Oops, sorry.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.520
Stuart Howe, head of development.

08:40.560 --> 08:44.120
This is Izzy Cartwright, head of operations,

08:40.560 --> 08:44.120
also Annette's sister,

08:44.160 --> 08:45.920
so she's had quite a shock.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.040
IZZY: I'm okay.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.320
I'm... I'm very sorry for your loss.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.680
Sandra Kendrick, Ms Burgess's PA.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.600
Dominic Claydon, um...

08:56.480 --> 08:58.240
Senior account executive.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.360
-Call me Bill.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.160
Uh, right. Bill.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.000
I understand that you keep your gun locked in a chest

09:04.200 --> 09:07.000
in your Jeep?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
Mmm-hmm.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.520
Yeah, so could you explain exactly when you noticed

09:09.080 --> 09:11.520
that your gun was missing?

09:11.560 --> 09:15.280
Well, it was a nightmare, middle of a bloody storm.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.640
The signal on my phone just went.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.040
You see, I was already taking Ms Kendrick into town

09:17.680 --> 09:21.040
to see the doctor

09:21.080 --> 09:25.560
and that's when Ms Cartwright discovered the body.

09:25.600 --> 09:30.200
So, I ran to my Jeep, and the bloody thing

09:25.600 --> 09:30.200
just conked out on me.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.720
And that's when I discovered that the chest had

09:30.240 --> 09:34.720
been broken into.

09:34.760 --> 09:39.600
Took me, oh, best part of three hours

09:34.760 --> 09:39.600
to jolt it back to life.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.840
You see, that's why it took so long to,

09:39.640 --> 09:43.840
er, get to a phone.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.200
To call you.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.000
Hang on. Uh, did nobody else here

09:46.240 --> 09:49.000
have a mobile phone?

09:49.040 --> 09:52.600
No. We had to leave them at Gatwick. In left luggage.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.640
Annette wanted us totally focused on the job

09:52.640 --> 09:56.640
in hand, no distractions.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.200
The only reason I was allowed a laptop was to take notes,

09:56.680 --> 10:00.200
as it were.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.880
DOMINIC: It's nothing she wouldn't have

10:00.240 --> 10:01.880
expected of herself.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.920
I mean, she was like that, all or nothing...

10:04.960 --> 10:07.960
Yes, it's interesting you say that, Mr Claydon,

10:04.960 --> 10:07.960
because, um...

10:08.000 --> 10:11.680
Ms Burgess did, in fact, keep her mobile phone,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.680
didn't she?

10:11.720 --> 10:14.120
-Yet you said it was missing. -SANDRA: Yes.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.080
I wasn't supposed to tell anyone.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.480
Yes. Right, uh...

10:23.520 --> 10:26.640
So, you all arrived, uh, Saturday morning, um,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.640
Gatwick via Orlando?

10:26.680 --> 10:30.120
Annette didn't get here till night.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.120
She missed her connection.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.800
-No, no, she went first class.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.560
She didn't say anything, she just...

10:36.960 --> 10:38.080
Got delayed.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.960
I'm sorry. It's been such a shock.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.600
Yes, of course.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.320
And so she excused herself at, um...

10:48.360 --> 10:50.760
-Yes, yes, yes.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.800
Well, the rest of us, we had a quick drink here.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.120
About an hour later, I went in to see her,

10:56.160 --> 10:59.320
just to discuss the programme for the coming day,

10:59.360 --> 11:03.080
and when I turned in at 11:00 p.m.,

10:59.360 --> 11:03.080
everybody's lights were out.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.480
Hmm.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.840
And that was the last time any of you heard

11:05.520 --> 11:07.840
or saw of her

11:07.880 --> 11:11.160
until you, Ms Cartwright, found her at 5:30?

11:13.200 --> 11:17.280
Okay. So, if you all wouldn't mind taking me through

11:13.200 --> 11:17.280
your exact movements

11:17.320 --> 11:19.760
between 10:30 p.m. and 5:30 a.m.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.480
I dropped like a stone, I'm afraid.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.200
Totally shattered because of the day we'd had.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.840
I see.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.720
Uh, I was asleep, too. All the time.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.120
-And me. Yeah. -Me, too. As of 11:00.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.200
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.520
Yes. Of course.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.280
Until the storm woke me up. Um... 4:30.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.880
-Mmm.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.680
Yes, and none of you heard a shot

11:41.920 --> 11:45.680
Unusual noises?

11:45.720 --> 11:47.640
-Oh, it was some thunder. -Mmm.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.120
And that was the thing, see? When I went to get her,

11:51.160 --> 11:54.840
I thought maybe she didn't hear anything

11:51.160 --> 11:54.840
because of the earplugs.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.320
-Yes, she always slept

11:54.880 --> 11:57.320
in them.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.560
And an eye mask.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.560
She couldn't turn off otherwise.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.560
Her mind was very active.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.680
What do you think, then

12:11.720 --> 12:13.800
Yes, well, I very much doubt that.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.840
Yeah, there were no signs of a struggle.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.840
Nothing valuable was taken.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.600
The only thing missing is the phone, which suggests

12:16.880 --> 12:20.600
that whoever has taken it

12:20.640 --> 12:24.040
did so for a very specific reason.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.320
You think that it was someone she knew?

12:27.360 --> 12:29.600
Hang on. Are you suggesting it was one of us?

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
Okay, thank you.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.480
So, all indications are she was shot in her sleep.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.720
Yet we know she never goes to sleep without

12:44.520 --> 12:47.720
her eye mask or earplugs,

12:47.760 --> 12:49.240
which she didn't have on.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.360
Maybe she was exhausted like the rest of them.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.800
And then there's the envelope with the tape in the safe.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.800
What's all that about?

12:55.920 --> 12:58.520
Take a look at this.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.680
Bus ticket into town, yesterday morning, 8:35.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.200
Strange to be popping out in the middle

13:01.720 --> 13:04.200
of intense team-building.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.360
Let's look into that. Exclusion fingerprints?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.760
Well, this glass is clean, but even if she drank

13:06.400 --> 13:09.760
straight from the bottle,

13:09.800 --> 13:11.040
it wouldn't show.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.880
-Apparently, she had no fingerprints.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.240
The paramedics, they say they heard of a similar case in...

13:16.280 --> 13:18.640
Oh, yes! Switzerland.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.480
Adermatoglyphia. A condition in which

13:18.680 --> 13:22.480
one has no fingerprints.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.600
We file that under "Strange, but true,"

13:24.640 --> 13:27.480
although my all-time favourite is trimethylaminuria,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.720
otherwise known as fish odour syndrome.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.800
Substances in the sufferer's blood, excreted through

13:29.760 --> 13:32.800
bodily fluids, smell of...

13:32.840 --> 13:36.880
-Yeah, we get it, fish. -Yes.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.520
Still, no fingerprints, wow!

13:42.880 --> 13:47.080
Right. First things first. JP and Dwayne, murder weapon.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.080
Scour this place.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.920
Also take a look at Williams's Jeep,

13:48.960 --> 13:50.760
see if there's any evidence of recent breakdown.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.320
That was, after all, three hours it took him

13:50.800 --> 13:52.320
to call us.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.760
Yes, Chief.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.280
Florence, let's get our hands on Stuart Howe's laptop

13:56.320 --> 13:58.880
and let's request the call log of Annette's mobile.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.240
One thing is for sure.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.680
This place is miles from anywhere

14:04.720 --> 14:06.400
and in the middle of rough terrain.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.320
Whoever did it, it was someone in this camp.

14:12.480 --> 14:16.040
Yes, well, they've certainly cornered the ethical

14:12.480 --> 14:16.040
millionaire market.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.880
Yoga retreats in southern Spain,

14:16.080 --> 14:19.880
eco-camping in the Andes...

14:20.720 --> 14:22.080
Oh.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.840
Breastfeeding breaks in the Himalayas.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.440
Still, great website. Bespoke, stylish, individual.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.040
And last valued at £116 million.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.200
GOODMAN: So, we have...

14:32.240 --> 14:35.920
Annette Burgess, 52, inspirational entrepreneuress.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.520
At least, that's what she calls herself.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.960
Yes, a sort of Alan Sugar with lipstick.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.520
Proper alpha female. Runs a tight ship,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.520
by the sounds of it.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.120
Sandra Kendrick, her PA.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.600
She's 55, single, been with the company

14:45.160 --> 14:47.600
since the beginning.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.520
Looks a bit, how shall I say, fragile.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.080
And there's Izzy, Annette's sister.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.760
The beta to Annette's alpha. Not quite so glamorous.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.440
Divorced, three kids, but engaged to Stuart Howe.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.640
Engaged? Isn't that a bit close for comfort

14:59.480 --> 15:03.640
in such a small company?

15:03.680 --> 15:07.240
Now, here's an interesting one, Dominic Claydon.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.240
Bit of a wallflower.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.960
Well, he's only been with the company four months.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.440
No track record in the field.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.440
And he's already a senior account executive?

15:13.480 --> 15:18.640
He's listed on the website as a creator and head

15:13.480 --> 15:18.640
of It's-so-bad.co.uk.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.440
It's an offshoot of It's-so-good,

15:20.480 --> 15:24.840
but dedicated to more hedonistic pursuits. Um...

15:24.880 --> 15:26.760
Fetish weekends in Marrakech,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.320
reckless skiing in the Dolomites.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.640
"It's So Good", "It's So Bad". It's all very clever.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.280
And we have Bill Williams.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.760
GOODMAN: Ah, yes, the man who lost three hours.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.040
Dwayne had a look at his Jeep, the oil pipe has been

15:35.800 --> 15:39.040
recently fixed.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.920
He was telling the truth about that.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.440
He runs team-building courses and conflict resolution

15:40.960 --> 15:44.440
workshops

15:44.480 --> 15:47.240
under the name of Williams Enterprises.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.280
He's moved around quite a bit and he came here from...

15:47.280 --> 15:51.280
Hampshire.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.760
It's "sher," not shire. "Hamp-sher."

15:54.800 --> 15:57.040
-Well done. Yeah.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.160
Anyway. No one has alibis.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.760
Or, indeed, motives, though I do have to say,

15:59.200 --> 16:01.760
Florence,

16:01.800 --> 16:04.200
this woman was somewhat of a despot.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.920
Pushes everyone else to their limits while

16:04.240 --> 16:07.920
she keeps her mobile phone

16:09.560 --> 16:10.800
Oh, no.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.680
Shouldn't you answer that?

16:15.720 --> 16:18.440
Hmm? No. They'll call back, uh, I'm sure.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.000
Any the wiser as to why she was delayed in Orlando?

16:23.040 --> 16:27.480
Apparently, she just showed up in a taxi

16:23.040 --> 16:27.480
12 hours later than expected.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.080
Well, that's as good a place to start as any.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.280
I want us to dig out everything we can

16:30.120 --> 16:33.280
about Annette Burgess.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.680
You don't get that successful without having

16:35.720 --> 16:38.000
a few skeletons in your closet.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.080
Right. All done there.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.240
How you getting on?

16:46.280 --> 16:49.200
Well, I'm just sitting there thinking about the best way

16:46.280 --> 16:49.200
to approach this.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.200
And this is something you'll learn in time.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.160
The secret of a good search is all in the planning.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.960
I mean, take a look at this place.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.200
There's a hell of a lot of mileage to cover here,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.200
you know?

16:58.240 --> 17:00.640
There's the different terrain, the vegetation,

17:00.680 --> 17:03.320
and let's not forget, we've just had a heavy storm.

17:03.360 --> 17:07.040
I mean, this is going to take a carefully thought-out

17:03.360 --> 17:07.040
strategy, you know?

17:07.080 --> 17:09.200
Or you could just start looking.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.600
Start looking? Listen.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.800
That attitude is going to get you nowhere

17:12.640 --> 17:15.800
in a real hurry, you know?

17:15.840 --> 17:18.360
You have to have a master plan.

17:18.400 --> 17:23.120
Otherwise, it's a total waste of manpower,

17:18.400 --> 17:23.120
time and resources.

17:23.160 --> 17:28.480
Look, this is something you'll learn with the benefit

17:23.160 --> 17:28.480
of hindsight and experience.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.760
Look what I just found.

17:40.920 --> 17:44.200
No one does Muzak better than the Americans.

17:44.240 --> 17:48.440
Right. Annette Burgess, born 1963 in Mansfield...

17:48.480 --> 17:52.200
Ah, Mansfield, home to the king

17:48.480 --> 17:52.200
of rock and roll.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.000
-No, Alvin Stardust.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.520
Although, to be precise, he was actually born

17:55.040 --> 17:57.520
in Muswell Hill

17:57.560 --> 17:59.560
and brought up in Mansfield...

17:59.600 --> 18:01.480
English cultural icon?

18:01.520 --> 18:03.800
<i>♪ Ah, coo-coo, choo ♪</i>

18:03.840 --> 18:06.200
Bernard... Never mind, as you were.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.200
Thank you.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.360
Moved to London in 1983...

18:11.400 --> 18:14.640
Ah, ah, it's ringing. Yes, hello, hello?

18:14.680 --> 18:17.480
Um, as I explained to your colleague...

18:14.680 --> 18:17.480
Mmm, what?

18:17.520 --> 18:22.880
Oh, uh, Annette Burgess. Phoenix 056 from Orlando.

18:17.520 --> 18:22.880
Yes.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.400
What?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.080
Yes, I'll hold. -DWAYNE: Chief!

18:28.400 --> 18:30.280
-Oh, my... -JP: Oh, yes.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.560
-Oh, yes.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.080
-Oh, yes, but not just.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.440
-Dominic Claydon.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.640
-Just arrived.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.480
Now, I took the liberty of widening out the search.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.480
He's been to prison.

18:53.520 --> 18:57.680
Four months in HMP Telbridge in Birmingham

18:53.520 --> 18:57.680
for drug-related theft.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.680
Hmm. Troubled background. Adopted as a baby,

18:57.720 --> 19:01.680
adoption failed.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.480
Ended up in a Barnardo's care home in Nottingham.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.680
Excluded from school, failed his GCSEs,

19:04.520 --> 19:08.680
in and out of rehab.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.640
Hang on, Mansfield's in Nottinghamshire.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.640
When was he born?

19:11.680 --> 19:13.840
-1983. -So they both come

19:11.680 --> 19:13.840
from the same place

19:13.880 --> 19:16.080
and the year he's born, she leaves for London.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.240
Let's get their medical records.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.000
Why... Why would I hurt her?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.440
She believed in me, she helped me turn

19:25.040 --> 19:27.440
my life around.

19:27.480 --> 19:31.240
She may have, but it wasn't because of your brilliantly

19:27.480 --> 19:31.240
creative mind, was it?

19:33.360 --> 19:38.000
You were born in Nottinghamshire, June 1983.

19:33.360 --> 19:38.000
Princess Alexandra's Hospital.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.200
And from Annette's medical records,

19:41.240 --> 19:45.160
we discover she was also at Princess Alexandra's Hospital

19:41.240 --> 19:45.160
at that time.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.280
Maternity ward.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.720
She was your mother, wasn't she?

19:58.600 --> 20:01.800
When I was inside.

20:01.840 --> 20:06.120
I...  I hit rock bottom.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.560
I thought if maybe I could find my birth mother, I...

20:11.720 --> 20:15.640
I couldn't believe it when I found out who she was.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.640
I read all these interviews where she said

20:15.680 --> 20:19.640
that she couldn't have kids.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.440
I was just too scared to approach her, so...

20:24.000 --> 20:26.240
I got a job as a temp in her company.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.520
I worked my socks off just learning the ropes until...

20:30.600 --> 20:32.120
I finally plucked up the courage.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.240
-You could say that again.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.320
She made me take a DNA test immediately.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.200
When it came back positive, she...

20:43.240 --> 20:44.400
She just panicked.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.960
Well, Progressive Businesswoman of the Year.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.520
Ethical Website of the Year. She is the brand!

20:54.560 --> 20:57.560
If people knew that she was hiding her son

20:54.560 --> 20:57.560
away somewhere,

20:57.600 --> 20:59.760
-they'd think she was a complete fraud.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.760
-Not necessarily.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.920
You've no idea.

21:06.560 --> 21:11.160
It's So Bad in exchange for my silence.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.080
It'd be my project to manage, to own.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.800
So it was her idea, not yours?

21:19.920 --> 21:23.680
She said that if she told everyone it was my idea,

21:19.920 --> 21:23.680
that it would...

21:23.720 --> 21:27.240
It would explain my new-found status.

21:27.280 --> 21:31.840
She said, "It's just to buy some time, trust me, I'll..."

21:31.880 --> 21:33.440
"I'll tell everyone on the next trip."

21:33.480 --> 21:37.120
-I do not want to talk about it.

21:33.480 --> 21:37.120
-Please, Annette!

21:37.160 --> 21:39.840
Why won't you tell them that you...

21:37.160 --> 21:39.840
What's the big deal?

21:39.880 --> 21:41.880
You were young, you... You had no choice.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.800
This is not the right time.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.320
DOMINIC: <i> Then it clicked.</i> <i>It was never going</i>

21:46.880 --> 21:50.320
<i>to be the right time.</i>

21:50.360 --> 21:54.320
<i>She just... She just couldn't</i> <i>bear the thought</i>

21:50.360 --> 21:54.320
<i>of other people knowing.</i>

21:54.360 --> 21:55.720
I trusted her.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.320
She just didn't want me.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.040
I knew Bill had a gun.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.560
When he brought us over here from the airport

22:05.080 --> 22:07.560
in his Jeep, I saw it.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.920
Breaking locks was no big deal for me.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.880
I just...

22:25.400 --> 22:28.240
I just killed my own mother!

22:28.280 --> 22:31.520
What have I... What have I done?

22:34.800 --> 22:37.600
What have I done?

22:39.560 --> 22:42.000
Yes, aye!

22:42.040 --> 22:46.400
-And that is case closed! -And in record time, too.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.240
Brainpower. Told you.

22:48.280 --> 22:53.160
Tragic, really. All his life, he looked

22:48.280 --> 22:53.160
for one person's approval.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.840
-Then he ended up killing... -No, it doesn't fit.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.800
-Oh, come on, Chief!

22:59.840 --> 23:02.960
Surely we're allowed to solve a case quickly

22:59.840 --> 23:02.960
at least once in a blue moon?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.880
-Uh...

23:04.920 --> 23:07.920
Maybe she just lost it earlier in the day and didn't mention.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.640
And what about the eye mask and the earplugs?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.280
She never went to sleep without them.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.920
The envelope, the sticky tape in the safe.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.920
Why were they there?

23:13.960 --> 23:17.600
Sir, with respect, this is getting silly.

23:17.640 --> 23:22.440
We have a suspect with motive, opportunity and means

23:17.640 --> 23:22.440
who has just confessed.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.400
-Hmm.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.240
There's just no pleasing some people.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.760
Well, I, for one, am going for a well-earned drink.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.760
You coming?

23:33.440 --> 23:35.600
Ah, <i> bonjour,</i> Cessay! Um... You go on ahead.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.200
I won't be long.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.080
Spoken like a true man.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.240
-Oh! Lord, no.

23:55.280 --> 23:59.640
-Uh, well, um, I... Well...

24:00.920 --> 24:02.520
We're just best kept apart.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.160
For everyone's sake. On either side of the planet.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.040
You know, I suppose a small drink is in order

24:07.200 --> 24:10.040
since we've cracked a case.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.880
Do you think, maybe, if the case is closed,

24:12.920 --> 24:17.520
you have more time to answer calls,

24:12.920 --> 24:17.520
rather than screen them?

24:17.560 --> 24:20.880
I just want to go back in. Back in!

24:20.920 --> 24:24.000
-I think you've had quite enough, my dear.

24:24.040 --> 24:27.200
Come on, <i> madame,</i> I'll take you back

24:24.040 --> 24:27.200
to the camp.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.720
If I could just have another wee drink.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.280
Don't think that's such a good idea.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.240
She was my sister! My sister!

24:39.280 --> 24:40.560
WOMAN: I know, darling, I know.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.880
Yeah, but why? Just tell me why!

24:42.920 --> 24:44.160
Maybe someone should go and get Stuart.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.400
-No! -Ow!

24:47.120 --> 24:48.840
-I'm sorry! -It's all right.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.040
You seem like such a nice man.

24:53.640 --> 24:57.320
I never really knew her. I never really knew her.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.000
Okay, okay. Why don't I take over here?

25:04.520 --> 25:07.480
I think someone needs a big drink.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.280
-Yes. -Come on, my dear.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.400
-Morning, all! -Morning, sir.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.600
DWAYNE: Yeah, morning. FLORENCE: Morning.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.280
Now, I was thinking... Maybe you were right.

25:24.320 --> 25:28.080
Maybe I just wasn't accepting that once in a blue moon,

25:24.320 --> 25:28.080
a case presents itself.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.840
It may seem, uh, bewildering, flummoxing,

25:28.120 --> 25:32.840
impossible, but then this...

25:32.880 --> 25:38.280
Uh, big, gigantic, over-knotted,

25:32.880 --> 25:38.280
messy, uh, knot

25:38.320 --> 25:42.280
just sorts of, well, unknots itself.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.920
-He doesn't get hangovers. -Mmm, figures.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.160
So, seeing as that's happened, we now have time

25:44.960 --> 25:48.160
for other things.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.440
-Team-building! Follow me.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.200
-This way!

25:54.240 --> 25:58.240
Okay, Dwayne, you stand here and we'll all stand

25:54.240 --> 25:58.240
behind you.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.560
-Transference, that's what.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.560
He can't accept that we solved the case.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.800
Or there's something else he's trying to avoid.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.720
Now, come on, this is serious, okay?

26:07.760 --> 26:09.520
You close your eyes, and when you're ready,

26:09.560 --> 26:11.000
you fall back and we will catch you.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.800
-Now, now. Trust!

26:13.840 --> 26:17.440
Okay, everyone? Ready, brace yourselves.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.840
-When you're ready, Dwayne.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.280
-No, no, no. I just don't think...

26:25.320 --> 26:26.400
-I'll get it! -I'll get it!

26:26.440 --> 26:28.480
-No! -It might be important.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.720
Now, look, this is ever so simple.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.720
I stand here, thus.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.840
-You stand here, thus. Have your arms ready, thus.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.840
-Er, Chief...

26:35.880 --> 26:37.760
Now, now, there's no time for thinking,

26:37.800 --> 26:41.680
and now is the time for being, being in the moment.

26:37.800 --> 26:41.680
I close my eyes, thus.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.880
And as I fall, you two...

26:46.240 --> 26:48.000
GOODMAN: Ow!

26:48.040 --> 26:51.000
That was the pathologist. Post-mortem's just been done.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.520
And the cause of death, it wasn't shooting.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.800
It was asphyxiation! She was already dead.

26:57.080 --> 26:59.120
I knew it. I knew it!

26:59.960 --> 27:01.600
Ow! Ow!

27:02.280 --> 27:03.280
Great.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.720
Right. "Cause of death, lack of blood supply

27:05.240 --> 27:07.720
to the brain,

27:07.760 --> 27:09.640
"consistent with suffocation.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.800
"Fibres from a cushion found in mouth.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.960
"Estimated time of death between 11:00 pm

27:11.840 --> 27:14.960
and midnight."

27:15.000 --> 27:16.800
That doesn't make any sense.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.240
On the contrary, Dwayne, at last something makes sense.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.240
It's all change.

27:20.280 --> 27:25.400
Right. See, all this still stands.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.680
But we have been investigating the wrong murder,

27:27.720 --> 27:29.880
thinking she was shot in her sleep.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.480
The real murder was the one that happened

27:29.920 --> 27:32.480
some three hours before,

27:32.520 --> 27:33.840
when she was suffocated with a cushion

27:33.880 --> 27:35.640
before being put to bed by the first killer

27:35.680 --> 27:37.240
to make it look like she was asleep,

27:37.280 --> 27:39.560
thus paving the way for the second killer, Dom.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.920
-She was dead already.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.000
-She was killed twice.

27:45.040 --> 27:49.320
And that's one hell of an achievement,

27:45.040 --> 27:49.320
being hated that much.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.400
Well, that explains the earplugs and the eye mask.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.480
-Mmm. -She was awake when

27:52.440 --> 27:54.480
the first killer came in.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.640
Yes, but we're still none the wiser as to the envelope

27:54.520 --> 27:57.640
and the sticky tape.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.040
Why were they locked in the safe?

27:59.080 --> 28:00.680
And the whereabouts of her phone.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.240
Crazy. Extraordinary. Right. Where were we?

28:00.720 --> 28:04.240
Fingerprints!

28:04.280 --> 28:05.800
Well, the only prints that were in the shack

28:05.840 --> 28:07.520
were Sandra Kendrick's and Bill Williams'.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.200
So, unless it was one of them, the real killer could've

28:07.560 --> 28:10.200
worn gloves.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.520
-We'll resume all these.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.520
And financial checks, too.

28:13.560 --> 28:16.120
-I've requested call logs.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.800
Texts will take longer to retrieve.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.440
And we still have her bus ticket into town.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.840
We know she went into town, but we don't know why.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.440
So that is your first point of call.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.520
What was she looking for

28:26.560 --> 28:29.400
I should get back to my friends in US Immigration,

28:29.440 --> 28:31.920
see if we can find out why she was held up

28:29.440 --> 28:31.920
in Orlando,

28:31.960 --> 28:35.040
right after I work out what to do with Mr Claydon.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.320
Um, I suppose we release him on bail?

28:38.360 --> 28:40.360
But he shot her. He killed her!

28:40.400 --> 28:42.160
I know she was dead already, but it's, uh...

28:42.200 --> 28:44.240
Highly unusual, Dwayne, I accept.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.520
But in this instance, I suppose all we can

28:44.280 --> 28:46.520
charge him with is attempted murder,

28:46.560 --> 28:48.800
not actual murder.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.680
So, he gets off?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.280
Well, he won't get off scot-free, but he certainly

28:50.720 --> 28:53.280
won't go down for life.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.320
You know, with a good barrister,

28:55.360 --> 28:58.320
probably only talking a few years.

28:58.360 --> 29:02.280
Suppose my father had a point, after all.

28:58.360 --> 29:02.280
Justice is like true love.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.560
Doesn't really exist.

29:09.600 --> 29:13.720
I killed her! I definitely killed her.

29:09.600 --> 29:13.720
I did!

29:13.760 --> 29:16.120
I know you meant to, but I'm afraid to say

29:13.760 --> 29:16.120
somebody beat you to it.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.600
I don't understand.

29:17.640 --> 29:18.960
I know. I'm trying to get my head around it as well.

29:21.480 --> 29:25.680
Look, once bail terms are set, you can be released

29:21.480 --> 29:25.680
pending further investigation.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.720
We'll, of course, hang on to your passport.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.800
Who?

29:31.480 --> 29:33.000
Who did it?

29:33.040 --> 29:34.680
That's what I intend to find out.

29:42.280 --> 29:46.200
Sorry, excuse me, <i> madame,</i> uh, have you seen

29:42.280 --> 29:46.200
this woman before?

29:47.360 --> 29:48.560
-No.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.560
-None whatsoever.

29:54.600 --> 29:59.080
I mean, half of these people weren't even there on the day.

29:54.600 --> 29:59.080
Can't complain, though.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.440
I mean, after all, you took all the bars.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.480
-You really didn't have to do that, you know.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.480
-Eh. No problem, JP.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.520
So, did you find anything?

30:08.560 --> 30:10.480
You know that Bertrand from La Couronne?

30:10.520 --> 30:12.440
Boy, he's a tough nut to crack, you know.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.000
It's like getting blood out of a stone.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.840
Just as well I've got that personal touch.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.200
Really loosens their tongue, you know.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.240
-DWAYNE: <i> Big.</i>

30:27.280 --> 30:31.120
Williams was crazy loud, ranting and raving

30:27.280 --> 30:31.120
down the phone,

30:31.160 --> 30:33.640
kicking and screaming. Everybody was looking!

30:33.680 --> 30:35.400
GOODMAN: <i> And we're sure</i> <i>it was Annette Burgess?</i>

30:35.440 --> 30:38.400
Not unless there's another Ms Burgess he

30:35.440 --> 30:38.400
was really hacked off with.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.760
Excellent work, Dwayne. You and JP stay in town, find out

30:38.440 --> 30:41.760
where she went from there.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.040
Yeah, I'm on it, Chief.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.520
-While we pay the man from Hamp...

30:43.080 --> 30:44.520
-Shire.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.160
...a little visit.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.520
JP!

30:50.120 --> 30:52.920
24... 26...

30:55.000 --> 30:56.120
30...

30:57.360 --> 30:58.440
28.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.280
No 28.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.480
No 28.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.960
I'm going to take a look round the back.

31:06.840 --> 31:10.360
I got more info. Get this. Bill Williams

31:06.840 --> 31:10.360
was an investment banker.

31:10.400 --> 31:14.040
He got fired after he attacked one of the

31:10.400 --> 31:14.040
other account executives.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.320
And, lucky for him, the company paid him off

31:14.080 --> 31:16.320
to leave.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.480
Sounds like he could use a little conflict resolution

31:16.360 --> 31:19.480
himself.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.720
The money will be there tomorrow!

31:20.760 --> 31:22.160
I told her the money'll be there tomorrow!

31:22.200 --> 31:25.640
And it gets better. Financial checks

31:22.200 --> 31:25.640
just came back.

31:25.680 --> 31:30.040
He's been declared insolvent. I'd say he's in serious

31:25.680 --> 31:30.040
trouble with the...

31:30.080 --> 31:31.200
Bailiffs?

31:36.680 --> 31:39.520
BILL: <i> I was only</i> <i>going after what's mine.</i>

31:39.560 --> 31:40.920
I'm on my knees here.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.560
Well, okay, so the mobile did have reception,

31:45.600 --> 31:47.280
it just didn't have any credit.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.800
And I couldn't afford to service the Jeep

31:47.320 --> 31:50.800
either, for months.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.640
She was supposed to pay half upfront, and the other

31:53.800 --> 31:57.640
half when she arrived.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.200
I mean, she was already a day late.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.320
And then when she did turn up, she didn't

32:00.240 --> 32:03.320
have any money on her!

32:03.360 --> 32:08.680
So, the next morning she says, "I need to go into town.

32:03.360 --> 32:08.680
I'll meet you there."

32:08.720 --> 32:12.560
Guess what? I'm waiting there, like Coco the Clown.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.480
She doesn't turn up!

32:14.520 --> 32:17.160
She phones me half an hour later.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.520
Ms Burgess, you said that yesterday,

32:17.200 --> 32:20.520
and you stood me up!

32:20.560 --> 32:24.640
ANNETTE: <i> Excuse me,</i> <i>I'm the client here,</i>

32:20.560 --> 32:24.640
<i>and I've got a lot on my mind.</i>

32:25.320 --> 32:26.360
What

32:31.280 --> 32:34.720
So, I think, "Well, maybe she's taken

32:31.280 --> 32:34.720
the money out in town,"

32:34.760 --> 32:38.520
so I run back to camp. Yeah? No, no chance.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.480
Well, I couldn't just let it lay.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.080
I want pay now! Now!

32:43.120 --> 32:45.880
And don't try and mess me about!

32:43.120 --> 32:45.880
I'm not one of your minions.

32:45.920 --> 32:50.320
Don't threaten me. Once it's over,

32:45.920 --> 32:50.320
I will pay you. Okay?

32:50.360 --> 32:54.680
BILL: <i> She was</i> <i>stringing me along.</i>

32:50.360 --> 32:54.680
<i>That wasn't the deal.</i>

32:54.720 --> 32:57.400
So that's why you went over to her shack that night.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.800
Nothing to do with the programme for the next day.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.680
But I didn't kill her.

33:03.880 --> 33:08.400
Why the hell would I do that What did I stand to gain?

33:11.280 --> 33:14.920
Aye, enjoy your work!

33:11.280 --> 33:14.920
That was my mother's!

33:21.560 --> 33:23.600
Can't take what he says at face value.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.160
The timing fits, and he did conceal the truth from us.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.960
But, and it is a big but, why would he do it?

33:26.200 --> 33:29.960
He'd never get paid.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.640
"I've got a lot on my mind."

33:31.680 --> 33:33.720
Now, that doesn't sound to me like she didn't want

33:31.680 --> 33:33.720
to pay him.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.360
Sounds like she had something more pressing to do.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.360
Why did she come to town that morning?

33:37.400 --> 33:39.080
Ah, Dwayne. What have you got?

33:39.120 --> 33:41.560
Not much, Chief. I just spoke to the bus driver.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.880
He said she took the bus back about 10:10.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.800
Nothing at first, until I went into the electronics shop.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.320
See, Annette Burgess went in there around 9:45

33:51.360 --> 33:54.200
and bought herself a smartphone charger.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.200
And get this.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.320
15 minutes later, she goes into Maxwell's

33:54.240 --> 33:57.320
convenience store

33:57.360 --> 34:01.680
and purchases a padded envelope, sticky tape,

33:57.360 --> 34:01.680
a bottle of whisky, a glass...

34:01.720 --> 34:02.960
Now, why would she buy those things?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.360
And why did she need them so urgently?

34:05.400 --> 34:07.040
What are you doing?

34:07.080 --> 34:09.080
Oh, hello. Sandra Kendrick.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.800
Now, what do you think she's doing here?

34:10.840 --> 34:13.400
FLORENCE: Whatever it is, she looks like a woman

34:10.840 --> 34:13.400
in a hurry.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.960
GOODMAN: Come on.

34:30.160 --> 34:33.280
Or not. This is Annette's e-mail account.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.600
-No! No, I...

34:36.640 --> 34:40.600
Look at this! "S Kendrick file.

34:36.640 --> 34:40.600
Let's catch up."

34:41.960 --> 34:45.160
"Sandra Kendrick, grievance procedure."

34:45.200 --> 34:48.360
You were suing Annette Burgess?

34:45.200 --> 34:48.360
For harassment.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.000
So, while we question her,

34:54.040 --> 34:56.040
I would like one of you to go up

34:54.040 --> 34:56.040
to the gully where she fell.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.960
-There might be some evidence up there.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.960
-I'll do it!

34:59.000 --> 35:00.680
And you can get on with the pile on my desk.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.480
You know, the paperwork, Stuart Howe's laptop...

35:02.520 --> 35:04.680
And, Dwayne, you might need some waterproofs up there.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.840
That gully gets more like a rancid swamp

35:04.720 --> 35:07.840
the further you get into it.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.560
Swamp?

35:13.680 --> 35:17.640
"On many occasions, she would refer to me as 'useless',

35:17.680 --> 35:20.760
"'stupid', 'moronic' and 'slow',

35:20.800 --> 35:25.040
"and not just in private, but significantly

35:20.800 --> 35:25.040
in front of other people.

35:25.080 --> 35:28.960
"When I expressed my upset, she would dismiss

35:25.080 --> 35:28.960
me as 'oversensitive' "and conclude that

35:29.000 --> 35:32.880
I should stop being such a wet blanket."

35:34.560 --> 35:36.280
How long has the harassment been going on?

35:36.920 --> 35:38.760
Seems like forever.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.560
At first, I just put up with it.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.360
After all, that was why she was who she was.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.680
But that backfired. Just gave her licence

35:47.400 --> 35:50.680
to carry on.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.920
And when she lost it, and it could be over nothing,

35:53.960 --> 35:57.440
she could be vicious, really vile.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.400
-I had to do something.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.200
Yes... Um, excuse me.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.120
Dwayne.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.200
Chief! I've done the route from the gully

36:05.160 --> 36:08.200
down to the stream's end.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.960
And?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.200
And I can't see nothing except some green slush

36:10.000 --> 36:13.200
and slime everywhere!

36:13.240 --> 36:14.280
Oh, dear.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.880
Hold on a minute. I can see something.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.400
Really?

36:19.440 --> 36:21.440
It's a bottle.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.960
<i>Like the ones in</i> <i>the victim's fridge.</i>

36:23.000 --> 36:25.080
You mean one of those energy drinks?

36:25.120 --> 36:27.480
No, no! It's not what you think.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.920
-Thank you, Dwayne. -My pleasure.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.280
She was already dead when I got there.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.080
Got there?

36:34.120 --> 36:37.000
It was awful of me, I know.

36:37.040 --> 36:40.520
It was so childish. I'd just had enough.

36:43.240 --> 36:46.240
That morning, she had had one of her turns again.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.840
-You are useless. Bloody useless!

36:46.280 --> 36:48.840
-That's what you said.

36:48.880 --> 36:53.360
Do you really think I would leave my own phone behind?

36:48.880 --> 36:53.360
I'm the bloody boss!

36:54.840 --> 36:58.960
Just because she couldn't find her mobile phone charger.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.400
I just wanted her to suffer.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.360
Just a little bit.

37:04.400 --> 37:08.920
<i>Aloe vera and orange juice.</i> <i>The best laxative there is.</i>

37:11.800 --> 37:16.080
<i>I wanted to replace</i> <i>the energy drink in the fridge</i>

37:11.800 --> 37:16.080
<i>with the one that I'd made.</i>

37:18.400 --> 37:20.840
<i>I knew the slightest noise</i> <i>woke her.</i>

37:23.880 --> 37:25.040
<i>She was so still.</i>

37:27.920 --> 37:31.120
<i>I just panicked.</i> <i>I was so scared.</i>

37:31.160 --> 37:32.320
<i>Lost my footing in the storm.</i>

37:34.000 --> 37:37.760
I thought, "This doesn't look good for me."

37:39.160 --> 37:42.840
So, I thought, "It's best just to say nothing."

37:45.720 --> 37:48.080
Check the bottle. It's all you'll find.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.120
I swear.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.560
My hunch is Sandra Kendrick doesn't have it in her.

37:53.600 --> 37:57.400
She's a mess, yes, but she's no

37:53.600 --> 37:57.400
criminal mastermind.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.880
And that wouldn't explain the envelope

37:57.440 --> 37:59.880
and the sticky tape,

37:59.920 --> 38:03.680
the glass, and why Annette needed

37:59.920 --> 38:03.680
her charger so urgently.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.280
-Yes.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.800
I think you should have a look at this.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.800
Stuart Howe's laptop.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.080
Now, I've been trawling through all of it

38:07.840 --> 38:10.080
and found nothing.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.720
Then I decided to look at the trash.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.760
MAN: <i> A wise man once said</i> <i>that a little bit of</i>

38:14.960 --> 38:18.760
<i>what is bad for you,</i>

38:19.920 --> 38:21.920
<i>could also be good for you.</i>

38:25.240 --> 38:27.080
Gordon Bennett!

38:27.120 --> 38:30.920
-Now, that's what I call a vacation with elation.

38:27.120 --> 38:30.920
-Dwayne.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.360
No, no, no, no, Chief! Not too fast forward.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.360
We might miss something.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.360
DWAYNE: Aw!

38:42.240 --> 38:43.840
MAN: <i> It's so bad.</i>

38:43.880 --> 38:46.440
GOODMAN: "All rights reserved, Stuart Howe."

38:46.480 --> 38:49.080
So, it was his idea, not Annette Burgess's.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.960
So, what was she doing, giving it to Dom Claydon?

38:52.000 --> 38:55.040
And what's it doing in the bin?

38:55.080 --> 38:57.840
There's plenty more where that came from.

38:57.880 --> 39:01.480
-To be honest, I felt petty bringing it up.

38:57.880 --> 39:01.480
-That's very selfless.

39:01.520 --> 39:05.040
Especially when you have an idea that's worth a hell

39:01.520 --> 39:05.040
of a lot of money and kudos.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.360
You were very careful to state "all rights reserved."

39:07.400 --> 39:10.080
-Look, I don't know where this is going...

39:10.120 --> 39:12.040
Unless you stole it off someone else.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.880
-That was my idea, all mine. -GOODMAN: Exactly.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.880
No one would give that up willingly.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.080
Did she promise you something in return?

39:20.120 --> 39:23.280
GOODMAN: Maybe she was threatening you with

39:20.120 --> 39:23.280
something. To keep you quiet.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.240
STUART: Like what? GOODMAN: I don't know.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.120
But I know it would have to be pretty big,

39:27.160 --> 39:29.160
something you wouldn't want anyone else to know about.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.240
Just keep your bloody voice down, will you?

39:31.280 --> 39:34.200
Oh...  Of course.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.640
That would explain it. You were having an affair.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.840
You and Annette. Weren't you?

39:47.640 --> 39:49.520
It was only the once.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.600
Maybe twice.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.200
Three times if you count the Paris trip.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.160
That idea was worth a fortune.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.480
She was gonna give me shares in the company.

40:08.520 --> 40:12.080
She was gonna make me vice-president,

40:08.520 --> 40:12.080
and then it all went away,

40:12.120 --> 40:16.760
and I couldn't do a bloody thing about it,

40:12.120 --> 40:16.760
because of one stupid mistake.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.040
It was my idea. I can prove it.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.880
We had a deal!

40:25.400 --> 40:27.240
-You wouldn't. -Try me.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.160
But remove Annette from the equation, you could

40:31.360 --> 40:34.160
claim back your idea,

40:34.200 --> 40:35.520
Izzy would be none the wiser.

40:37.680 --> 40:42.120
Look, I might be a two-timing cheat,

40:37.680 --> 40:42.120
but I'm not a psychopath.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.600
I wouldn't murder someone for that.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.240
So, Izzy doesn't know anything about you and Annette?

40:48.280 --> 40:49.800
I don't think so.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.880
Well, I hope not.

40:56.160 --> 40:59.880
Gosh. All this time, she really didn't know?

40:59.920 --> 41:04.480
Love is blind, eh? In some cases it can

40:59.920 --> 41:04.480
also be deaf and dumb.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.080
-I mean... -Of course she knew.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.440
Remember when we met them all?

41:08.480 --> 41:10.880
-STUART: She's had quite a shock.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.880
-I'm okay.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.200
She shifted away from him. And the night

41:10.920 --> 41:14.200
we saw her drunk...

41:14.240 --> 41:19.560
She was my sister! Why? Just tell me why!

41:19.600 --> 41:24.560
Izzy wasn't upset about her sister.

41:19.600 --> 41:24.560
She was upset with her sister.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.520
You know, the more I think about it,

41:26.560 --> 41:29.600
the question is not how come Annette Burgess was killed

41:26.560 --> 41:29.600
twice in one night,

41:29.640 --> 41:32.960
but how come she was only killed twice in one night?

41:37.840 --> 41:40.400
-Since lunchtime.

41:40.440 --> 41:41.680
And all that time, she was just drinking?

41:42.400 --> 41:44.760
Well, yes, that, and...

41:44.800 --> 41:46.640
Crying into her phone.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.720
Phone? She's not supposed to have her phone.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.800
They left their phones in England.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.960
Unless she got a mobile here, but I'm sure she didn't have

41:51.840 --> 41:54.960
one on her that evening.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.040
No.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.520
Is this what you're looking for?

41:58.560 --> 42:02.640
My chef, Vivianne, suddenly arrived with

41:58.560 --> 42:02.640
a new smartphone this morning.

42:02.680 --> 42:06.520
I figured it was only a matter of time before

42:02.680 --> 42:06.520
someone came in asking for it.

42:09.080 --> 42:12.320
Apparently, she found it in the toilet bin.

42:12.360 --> 42:16.480
She cracked under my interrogation technique.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.360
How do you say...

42:18.400 --> 42:19.560
Hardcore.

42:36.680 --> 42:40.040
Your sister's phone.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.920
We have a witness who saw you with it.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.040
Earlier that night.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.480
I'm not as gullible as I may look.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.960
<i>Of course, I knew something</i> <i>was up for ages.</i>

43:01.000 --> 43:03.280
<i>And when I saw them</i> <i>talking on the bridge...</i>

43:03.320 --> 43:04.920
-You wouldn't. -Try me.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.880
<i>I felt like I'd been</i> <i>kicked by a horse.</i>

43:09.920 --> 43:11.680
But now, so many things made sense.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.000
Still, I had to know for sure.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.440
We're gonna have one last exercise.

43:17.480 --> 43:18.760
Can I just nip to the loo?

43:24.280 --> 43:25.920
"Mobile-free zone."

43:28.120 --> 43:29.440
Yeah, right.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.680
<i>I read all their</i> <i>text messages.</i>

43:34.720 --> 43:38.880
<i>She had everything she wanted.</i> <i>And she had to</i>

43:34.720 --> 43:38.880
<i>have him as well.</i>

43:44.880 --> 43:46.000
Takes after her mother.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.920
Dad always said she was toxic.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.720
What do you mean by "her mother"?

43:52.760 --> 43:56.880
We're half-sisters. Same dad, different mums.

43:56.920 --> 43:59.080
He left Annette's mum when Annette was very young,

43:59.120 --> 44:01.360
and spent 30 very happy years with mine.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.480
Maybe that's why she was so ruthless...

44:05.640 --> 44:06.760
Heartless.

44:06.800 --> 44:09.080
You hid vital evidence.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.640
I was just trying to hang on to him.

44:13.640 --> 44:16.440
But the only person she called on that Sunday

44:13.640 --> 44:16.440
was Bill Williams.

44:16.480 --> 44:19.600
-Damn. -Maybe she needed

44:16.480 --> 44:19.600
to charge the phone

44:19.640 --> 44:21.680
to look at her e

44:21.720 --> 44:24.520
-Well, yes.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.960
-There was nothing unusual there.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.960
-Oh, for...

44:27.000 --> 44:28.880
US Immigration?

44:28.920 --> 44:32.440
Industrial action. No wonder she missed her flight.

44:28.920 --> 44:32.440
These guys are impossible!

44:32.480 --> 44:35.880
Argh! We're getting nowhere. We need to be more creative!

44:35.920 --> 44:37.680
One person is murdered twice in one night.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.480
Envelope and sticky tape in the safe,

44:39.520 --> 44:41.480
bottle of whisky, glass... What the hell does that mean?

44:41.520 --> 44:44.600
-Maybe there were... -Earplugs, eye mask,

44:41.520 --> 44:44.600
envelope, sticky tape...

44:44.640 --> 44:46.880
-Hey! Hey! -...gun, bottle of whisky...

44:46.920 --> 44:50.280
I do wish you'd stop doing that.

44:46.920 --> 44:50.280
Interrupting.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.000
Yes, um, sorry.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.560
It's an annoying habit of mine.

44:55.600 --> 44:59.120
Well, the one thing I did inherit from my dad! I mean...

45:02.920 --> 45:04.280
Immigration.

45:06.480 --> 45:08.640
-Of course! I should have thought of that...

45:06.480 --> 45:08.640
-BILL: <i> You stood me up!</i>

45:08.680 --> 45:11.680
ANNETTE: <i> Excuse me,</i> <i>I'm the client here,</i>

45:08.680 --> 45:11.680
<i>and I've got a lot on my mind!</i>

45:11.720 --> 45:13.960
You are useless. Bloody useless!

45:14.000 --> 45:16.480
Takes after her mother. Heartless.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.800
Well, she was like that. It was all or nothing.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.240
She was killed twice?

45:20.280 --> 45:22.440
Give me her phone. Thank you.

45:24.080 --> 45:27.280
Here we go, here we go. Wellington Clinic...

45:27.320 --> 45:31.520
Oh, brilliant. That's absolutely clever.

45:27.320 --> 45:31.520
Very clever.

45:31.560 --> 45:32.920
How do you mean?

45:32.960 --> 45:34.640
Now all that remains is to make a couple of phone calls

45:34.680 --> 45:36.880
and get the prints sent to the UK for verification.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.600
And someone get everyone together!

45:38.640 --> 45:41.160
This time we're going to solve this properly.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.800
Good afternoon.

45:49.720 --> 45:51.680
Thank you for joining us.

45:53.440 --> 45:57.240
Now, if there was one thing my father instilled in me

45:53.440 --> 45:57.240
as a child,

45:57.280 --> 45:59.520
it was, "Trust no one."

45:59.560 --> 46:03.680
Over the years, that's made for some pretty

45:59.560 --> 46:03.680
tense Sunday lunches,

46:03.720 --> 46:07.080
but it's come in very handy in my line of work.

46:07.120 --> 46:11.000
In this case, before you could even say

46:07.120 --> 46:11.000
"dysfunctional family,"

46:11.040 --> 46:14.120
one of you promptly confessed to shooting her in the chest.

46:15.160 --> 46:17.680
A child abandoned at birth,

46:17.720 --> 46:19.920
and rejected all over again.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.680
Unfortunately for Annette,

46:23.720 --> 46:27.200
it seems that more than one of you had

46:23.720 --> 46:27.200
a reason to want her dead.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.040
Now, what are the chances of that?

46:30.080 --> 46:34.720
One person being murdered twice in one night

46:30.080 --> 46:34.720
by two different people?

46:36.720 --> 46:40.400
Fortunately for us, some things in that room

46:41.920 --> 46:46.160
told us the real story behind Annette's murder.

46:46.200 --> 46:50.760
<i>An envelope containing</i> <i>an unused roll of sticky tape</i>

46:46.200 --> 46:50.760
<i>locked inside a safe.</i>

46:50.800 --> 46:52.920
A bottle of whisky, a glass,

46:54.040 --> 46:57.080
and Annette's missing mobile phone.

46:57.120 --> 47:01.000
We know that you, Bill Williams, had serious

46:57.120 --> 47:01.000
financial problems.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.680
Annette Burgess was gonna let you sink.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.600
Killing her wouldn't have got you paid.

47:05.640 --> 47:08.080
But with your colourful history of angry outbursts...

47:08.120 --> 47:10.240
No. I wouldn't.

47:11.440 --> 47:13.440
-I didn't. -No, you didn't.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.360
Now, you, Ms Cartwright...

47:17.400 --> 47:19.640
You were the one with the happy childhood,

47:19.680 --> 47:23.840
but you felt your sister shone bright while you fell short.

47:23.880 --> 47:27.640
And then she took away the one thing

47:23.880 --> 47:27.640
that you did have over her.

47:27.680 --> 47:30.400
A future husband. Stuart Howe.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.640
And then, as if to add insult to injury,

47:35.680 --> 47:39.080
she used that very fact to take away your

47:35.680 --> 47:39.080
precious idea, Mr Howe.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.760
And gave it to a total nobody.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.320
And what about her right

47:45.800 --> 47:48.320
Her Ms Kendrick?

47:49.320 --> 47:51.600
She bullied and humiliated you.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.200
It wasn't me.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.400
No. No, it wasn't you.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.240
Or you. Or you.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.120
Or you.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.520
Despite the fact that none of you had an alibi.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.120
So, who was it, then?

48:11.400 --> 48:13.080
Well...

48:14.520 --> 48:17.000
One of you had the best alibi of all.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.840
He'd confessed to her murder already.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.720
What?

48:27.200 --> 48:29.120
No, I... I shot her!

48:29.160 --> 48:32.800
You shot her after you smothered her.

48:32.840 --> 48:35.640
You killed your own mother

48:36.560 --> 48:38.800
Well, uh, yes and no.

48:38.840 --> 48:40.920
Yes, he killed her twice.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.680
And no, she wasn't his mother.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.080
What?

48:47.760 --> 48:50.680
-I told you the truth! -Again, yes and no.

48:50.720 --> 48:53.320
Yes, you were abandoned as a child.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.720
And no, you're not Dom Claydon.

48:58.160 --> 49:02.120
Anyone know what adermatoglyphia is

49:02.160 --> 49:06.280
Well, it's basically a condition in which

49:02.160 --> 49:06.280
you have no fingerprints.

49:06.320 --> 49:10.040
It's also known as "immigration delay disease."

49:10.080 --> 49:12.880
The US introduced a procedure a few years back

49:12.920 --> 49:16.480
where they take the fingerprints of everyone

49:12.920 --> 49:16.480
entering the country.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.800
But when they took Annette's,

49:22.400 --> 49:25.720
they discovered she had none.

49:25.760 --> 49:31.440
Identical thing happened to a Swiss woman in 2008,

49:25.760 --> 49:31.440
a certain Heidi Oppenheimer,

49:31.480 --> 49:35.160
who was travelling from Zurich to Boston, apparently

49:31.480 --> 49:35.160
to meet her boyfriend. She was stunned. She never

49:35.200 --> 49:38.880
knew she had no fingerprints. I mean, why would she?

49:40.680 --> 49:44.760
Now, I had heard about Ms Oppenheimer

49:40.680 --> 49:44.760
and her detainment,

49:44.800 --> 49:48.960
but what I didn't know is that when she went

49:44.800 --> 49:48.960
back to Switzerland,

49:49.000 --> 49:53.240
doctors performed tests on all of her immediate

49:49.000 --> 49:53.240
relatives,

49:53.280 --> 49:55.360
and they made a discovery.

49:56.600 --> 50:00.200
Adermatoglyphia runs in families.

50:00.240 --> 50:03.320
-But I have fingerprints. -Through the mother's side.

50:03.360 --> 50:06.520
You have different mothers. Which is why

50:03.360 --> 50:06.520
you have fingerprints.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.360
She didn't.

50:09.920 --> 50:13.040
-Oh. -"Oh," exactly.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.520
Picture the scene.

50:16.560 --> 50:20.240
Annette sat stranded in Orlando airport

50:16.560 --> 50:20.240
having been told all that.

50:20.280 --> 50:22.000
She's reeling.

50:22.040 --> 50:24.240
Like Ms Oppenheimer, she'd had no idea

50:22.040 --> 50:24.240
she didn't have fingerprints.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.320
Why would she? She'd never been in trouble with the law,

50:26.360 --> 50:28.880
never had a reason to be fingerprinted.

50:28.920 --> 50:33.000
But she does know that the rest of you sailed through

50:28.920 --> 50:33.000
and got your connection.

50:33.040 --> 50:37.760
So she also knows that you, Dom, her long-lost son,

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
are likely to be nothing of the sort.

50:41.560 --> 50:45.800
After all, if she had no fingerprints,

50:41.560 --> 50:45.800
you can't have any, either.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.440
I had a DNA test!

50:47.480 --> 50:48.960
Yes, I'm coming to that, if you'll allow me.

50:51.720 --> 50:55.920
By the time she lands on Saint Marie,

50:51.720 --> 50:55.920
her phone battery's dead.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.960
She blows her top when she realises

50:55.960 --> 50:58.960
her charger wasn't taken.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.880
She goes into town. First things first,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.880
she buys a new charger.

51:01.920 --> 51:05.040
She googles the Wellington Clinic. Remember them?

51:01.920 --> 51:05.040
They did your test.

51:05.080 --> 51:09.200
But they're shut at the weekend.

51:05.080 --> 51:09.200
What does she do?

51:09.240 --> 51:13.880
If you had fingerprints, you weren't her son.

51:09.240 --> 51:13.880
What could she use?

51:13.920 --> 51:18.080
The good old-fashioned method. Glass and sticky tape.

51:18.120 --> 51:21.080
Quick, simple, effective.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.960
You'll have your drink, then once you've gone,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.640
she'll sprinkle blusher onto the glass,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.640
put some tape on it...

51:25.680 --> 51:28.040
Hey, presto!

51:28.080 --> 51:31.840
All she needs is to seal it in an envelope

51:28.080 --> 51:31.840
and lock it in a safe.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.680
She purchases the necessary items.

51:35.400 --> 51:38.080
And then just before dinner,

51:38.120 --> 51:40.000
she asks you for a drink.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.400
Can I just nip to the loo?

51:47.920 --> 51:49.840
Midnight. Drink.

51:51.320 --> 51:56.040
GOODMAN: <i> You knew right then</i> <i>something was up.</i>

51:56.080 --> 52:00.200
I imagine it wasn't long before she hinted

51:56.080 --> 52:00.200
at her true motive.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.520
Her suspicion that you weren't her son.

52:05.680 --> 52:08.800
I lost the letter, unfortunately.

52:08.840 --> 52:11.440
It was the Wellington Clinic, wasn't it?

52:13.680 --> 52:18.040
GOODMAN: <i> A ginormous wave</i> <i>of panic washed over you.</i>

52:18.080 --> 52:22.360
All this time, all this work you'd put in,

52:18.080 --> 52:22.360
and she was onto you!

52:22.400 --> 52:25.400
And she would show no mercy in making you pay.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.480
<i>So you had to stop her,</i> <i>you had to stop her!</i>

52:34.680 --> 52:36.600
<i>Smothered her with a cushion!</i>

52:40.520 --> 52:42.520
But then,

52:42.560 --> 52:46.120
after you realised what you'd done in the heat of

52:42.560 --> 52:46.120
the moment, how stupid it was,

52:46.160 --> 52:47.440
you were totally trapped.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.680
<i>Of course,</i> <i>once we started investigating,</i>

52:53.720 --> 52:57.080
<i>well, it will only be a matter</i> <i>of time before you were</i>

52:53.720 --> 52:57.080
<i>exposed as her "son"</i>

52:59.280 --> 53:01.320
<i>and become our prime suspect.</i>

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
But if you had to be found,

53:07.240 --> 53:09.520
let it be for the lesser crime.

53:11.600 --> 53:14.160
<i>You put her in bed to make</i> <i>it look like she was asleep.</i>

53:18.000 --> 53:20.280
<i>You wiped the glass down,</i> <i>proving that she asked you</i>

53:18.000 --> 53:20.280
<i>for a drink,</i>

53:20.320 --> 53:23.720
<i>and not that you went over to</i> <i>confront her, as you claimed.</i>

53:23.760 --> 53:25.400
Then...

53:25.440 --> 53:27.920
You go ahead and do exactly what you told us.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.480
You break the chest to get Bill's gun.

53:31.960 --> 53:35.800
<i>-And then you make your way</i> <i>back to Annette's shack...</i>

53:35.840 --> 53:37.720
<i></i>

53:37.760 --> 53:40.760
You plant the gun nearby for us to find it.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.680
Then you confess to the second murder,

53:43.720 --> 53:47.760
and you sit back and wait for the post-mortem results

53:43.720 --> 53:47.760
to exonerate you.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.280
Yes, you would still go to prison.

53:51.160 --> 53:53.240
But not for murder.

53:53.280 --> 53:56.880
For attempted murder, which carries a much

53:53.280 --> 53:56.880
lesser sentence.

53:56.920 --> 53:57.920
Brilliant plan!

53:59.760 --> 54:01.440
But with one flaw.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.240
You knew she was onto you, but you didn't know how

54:03.920 --> 54:07.240
and you didn't know why.

54:07.280 --> 54:12.240
And the very thing you planted for us to find, the gun,

54:07.280 --> 54:12.240
had your fingerprints on it.

54:12.280 --> 54:15.920
Fingerprints you wouldn't have had if you were really

54:12.280 --> 54:15.920
Annette Burgess's son.

54:18.680 --> 54:22.200
We sent your fingerprints to HMP Telbridge,

54:22.240 --> 54:26.360
and they very helpfully faxed us your full file.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.880
Your real name is Craig Russell.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.760
You served 18 months for forgery at HMP Telbridge,

54:33.800 --> 54:36.480
from January 2011 to July 2012.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.200
Guess who else served time there.

54:41.480 --> 54:44.000
That's right. Dominic Claydon.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.440
A long-term junkie

54:47.440 --> 54:50.800
serving time for drug-related theft.

54:50.840 --> 54:54.400
<i>What happened?</i> <i>Were you in the same cell</i>

54:50.840 --> 54:54.400
<i>for a while?</i>

54:56.600 --> 54:58.600
I imagine, those long days inside,

54:58.640 --> 55:03.160
a clever man like yourself might have spotted

54:58.640 --> 55:03.160
an opportunity.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.080
An opportunity to take another man's identity

55:05.120 --> 55:07.880
and create a better, more prosperous future

55:05.120 --> 55:07.880
for yourself.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.760
And with your talent for forgery,

55:13.240 --> 55:17.120
creating a false DNA test, well...

55:17.160 --> 55:19.600
It must've been a walk in the park.

55:30.440 --> 55:34.160
Dominic was such a loser.

55:34.200 --> 55:38.160
Half the time, he didn't even know

55:34.200 --> 55:38.160
what day it was.

55:39.680 --> 55:42.280
And he blamed it all on his mum.

55:45.200 --> 55:48.720
Every night was the same.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.560
He'd start crying...

55:51.600 --> 55:56.840
"Did I tell you that she's Annette Burgess?"

55:57.640 --> 55:59.880
Yeah, you did.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.720
300 times.

56:06.680 --> 56:09.720
You could see that he was only going one way.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.480
The irony is, with that mentality,

56:17.920 --> 56:19.880
you really could've been her son.

56:21.760 --> 56:23.200
Take him away.

56:42.880 --> 56:46.880
You see, JP? Teamwork, and another successful case.

56:46.920 --> 56:49.120
And now I need a drink! Chief?

56:49.160 --> 56:50.600
<i>Et voila!</i>

56:50.640 --> 56:53.240
Very nice to have you all <i> chez moi</i> for a change.

56:53.280 --> 56:57.600
I've even come up with my own version of island rum punch.

57:00.320 --> 57:03.640
Hey! What is that monstrosity doing here?

57:03.680 --> 57:06.160
Everyone needs a loving home, Dwayne, Gilbert included.

57:08.160 --> 57:10.560
So, you're talking to plants as well as lizards?

57:10.600 --> 57:13.280
And what about your gift, sir?

57:13.320 --> 57:17.600
Ah, yes, for my dad. Well, at the moment, I'm torn

57:13.320 --> 57:17.600
between detoxing in Mexico

57:17.640 --> 57:20.000
-and breastfeeding in the Himalayas.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.240
Himalayas!

57:23.080 --> 57:24.520
Well, bottoms up!

57:31.600 --> 57:34.920
-Yep. I've got beers

57:31.600 --> 57:34.920
in the fridge.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.720
-I'll give you a hand.

57:37.640 --> 57:39.400
-You know,

57:39.440 --> 57:42.520
-you'll have to speak to him at some point.

57:39.440 --> 57:42.520
-Yes.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.640
What's the worst that could happen?

57:44.680 --> 57:46.360
He's on the other side of the world, after all.

57:47.960 --> 57:51.000
MAN: <i> Humphrey? I'm having</i> <i>no luck getting hold of you.</i>

57:51.040 --> 57:55.160
<i>I suppose it doesn't matter</i> <i>very much as we'll be catching</i>

57:51.040 --> 57:55.160
<i>up very soon face-to-face.</i>

57:55.200 --> 57:57.920
<i>I'm coming over next Thursday.</i>

58:03.440 --> 58:05.360
-DWAYNE: Jack Harmer's

58:03.440 --> 58:05.360
been shot!

58:05.400 --> 58:08.400
Lock down the entire courthouse.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.400
Nobody leaves, nobody enters!

58:08.440 --> 58:10.440
-Oi! Hey!

58:10.480 --> 58:12.160
JP: <i> Someone died</i> <i>in our custody.</i>

58:12.200 --> 58:14.760
What were we doing at the time? Waiting for rum.

58:14.800 --> 58:16.280
So, you're saying it's my fault?

58:16.320 --> 58:18.320
JP: <i> I just don't want</i> <i>to be that kind of officer.</i>

58:18.360 --> 58:20.600
Humphrey! What the bloody hell's going on?

58:20.640 --> 58:22.520
Sally still loves you.

58:22.560 --> 58:25.440
You need to get home, pick up where you left off.

58:25.480 --> 58:28.240
Our reputation's at stake, and you want to up and leave?
