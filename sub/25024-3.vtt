Uh, maybe I should sit this one out.

Maybe you should sit school out too.

Changelings call it "Grave Sand."

02:04.749 --> 02:08.086
Derived from the pulverized bones
of fallen Gumm-Gumms,

02:08.169 --> 02:12.090
Grave Sand aids us Changelings
in shedding our human form

02:12.173 --> 02:14.884
and embracing our more trollish nature.

02:14.968 --> 02:19.097
In humans, the Grave Sand
should hone your feral instincts.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.224
It changes your nature.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.978
-Some of the changes are permanent.

03:20.283 --> 03:25.246
Gunmar takes Trollmarket, and of course
you slither out from under your rock.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.719
[sniffing, grunts]

03:39.802 --> 03:44.474
Yuck! You gave him Grave Sand.
That's not meant for humans.

-[panting]
-[Blinky] Oh, dear.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.520
Master Jim, look at me.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.608
The very reason the Amulet chose you
is your humanity.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.567
[grunts]

03:54.651 --> 03:57.904
And following your human instincts
hasn't failed you yet.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.995
[coughs] I'm sorry. I lost myself.

04:06.079 --> 04:10.124
Jim is a good kid,
but a good kid can't kill Gunmar.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.211
Brutality and deceit won't suffice either.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.964
Sometimes deceit is the only option.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.216

You lie to your mother every day.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.597
I protect her... [coughs]
to keep her out of this.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.976
We have a greater concern. According
to Aaarrrgghh!!!'s reconnaissance,

04:28.059 --> 04:30.270
Gunmar has left Trollmarket.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.522
He still chases the Eternal Night.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.607
Until we learn more,
we must remain vigilant

04:34.691 --> 04:37.694
and use this time to prepare...
the right way.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.279
Let me just go grab my stuff.

04:39.362 --> 04:43.658
We must take every precaution
in the event Gunmar strikes.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.834
-Mom, I packed you a lunch!
-[Barbara] Down here, honey!

04:54.085 --> 04:55.378

04:59.716 --> 05:01.384
No, no, no. [grunts]

05:06.973 --> 05:11.602
So, what do you think?
I call it "Goodbye, Walt."

05:13.021 --> 05:16.149
You warned me he was bad news,
but I didn't listen.

05:16.232 --> 05:20.194
Then he vanishes without a goodbye.
What kind of man does that?

05:20.278 --> 05:22.488
Hence the horns. They're symbolic.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.241
Wow, Mom. Quite the imagination.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.826
[Barbara] Oh, thank you, sweetie.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.953
First your father, and now him.

05:29.037 --> 05:33.041
-I swear, if I ever see Walt again--
-On that note, [chuckles] gotta run.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.213
How can Claire still be sick?

05:39.297 --> 05:42.175

not to talk to me in school.

but I'd like to be your friend.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.695
-One, two...
-Uh... no, 50!

06:02.779 --> 06:05.073
...three, four. [grunts]

-Oh, great.
-The teachers' lounge.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.923
-The educational no-fly zone.
-Just cover me, okay?

06:22.006 --> 06:23.716
[Coach Lawrence] Kids these days...

06:23.800 --> 06:27.929
You try to open up to them,
then they shut you down.

06:28.012 --> 06:31.099
Well, at least you get a reaction.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.684
I became a teacher to make a difference.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.145
Now I just make them fall asleep.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.980
[Señor Uhl] Oh, quit grousing, Lenora.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.025
My students stole my truck,
and tried to poison me

06:41.109 --> 06:43.402
with a Diablo Maximus Breakfast Burrito.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.531
Detention does nothing.
No discipline, no respect.

no-dancing zone, Domzalski.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.964
[Coach Lawrence]
Oh, what? Empty again? Come on!

07:04.173 --> 07:07.593
Am I the only one who makes coffee?
What? I--

07:08.511 --> 07:10.263
What-- Why's the coffee on the floor?

07:10.888 --> 07:13.724
[sniffs, groans] Smells organic.

07:45.339 --> 07:48.134
-I'm doing the best I can, sir.
-Let me ask you.

07:48.217 --> 07:52.388
How have you not been eaten by a hawk
with those embryonic little legs?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.266
Oh, look out. Run, little worm. Run!

07:55.349 --> 07:57.185
Jeez, who peed in his coffee?

07:57.268 --> 07:58.769
Cut him some slack, Coach.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.856
[grunting]
Your father might've taken your lip,

08:02.440 --> 08:06.319
but you're playing on my field now.
If it wasn't for your mother,

08:06.402 --> 08:08.696
I'd have shipped you off
to military school, Son.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.740
You said you wouldn't say anything.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.908
-Dude.
-Dude.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.203
-Dude.
-Coach and Steve's mom?

08:15.286 --> 08:18.206
You think I like picking up
pimple pads and pudding snacks?

08:18.289 --> 08:21.375
[stutters] You're a disgrace, Palchuk.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.007
I hate you!

08:28.090 --> 08:31.010
Tobes, maybe there was something
in his coffee.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.636
[latch clicking]

08:33.221 --> 08:36.765
-[sniffs] Oh, no.
-What did you do?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.726
I must've grabbed the wrong can.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.561
-It's okay, Steve.
-[grunts]

08:40.645 --> 08:43.272
Coach might have made coffee
with Gumm-Gumm ashes.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.941
He drank dead troll?

08:45.024 --> 08:49.654
-This is you, Lake, isn't it?
-Uh, I'm sure Jim had a good reason.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.947
It was a huge mistake.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.491
He drank something
that's making him act like a troll.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.408

you better undo it,

09:13.553 --> 09:16.722
Young Atlas, it's fourth period.
Shouldn't you be...

09:16.806 --> 09:18.349
dissecting a frog?

09:18.432 --> 09:20.643
-[both] Strickler?
-Hypothetical question.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.813
What if someone accidentally ate
Grave Sand?

09:23.896 --> 09:26.065
What? It's not meant to be consumed.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.651
That would amplify its effects tenfold.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.530
[chuckles] No need to be concerned.
It was just Toby's cat.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.283
[meows and hisses]

09:35.366 --> 09:37.243
-[snarls]
-[Toby] Meow!

Tasty cat.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.540
-[sniffing]
-[gasps]

09:44.041 --> 09:47.545
-So how do we help the cat?
-He's coming!

09:47.628 --> 09:49.755
[Strickler]
I'd recommend putting the cat down.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.673
[howls]

09:50.756 --> 09:53.009
-It's the only merciful thing to do.
-What?

09:53.092 --> 09:54.427
[meows and hisses]

09:54.510 --> 09:58.306
What if that's not an option?
What if the cat means a lot to Toby?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.516
[Toby meowing]

10:00.600 --> 10:01.726
Stop meowing.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.770
To bring him back,
you need to break through his delusions

10:04.854 --> 10:06.522
and emotionally connect with him

10:06.606 --> 10:10.067
before his altered state
becomes permanent.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.944
-[whispers] Permanent--?!
-[Toby meows]

10:12.028 --> 10:15.740
Now, how one emotionally connects
with a feline is debatable.

10:15.823 --> 10:19.535
-[meowing and hissing]
-[growls] You're no cat!

10:27.418 --> 10:29.378
Well, the hospital and I agreed

10:29.462 --> 10:32.465
it might be best if, you know,
I took a little time off.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.259
Great. Okay.
Well, let's catch up next week.

Hey, TP!

11:01.702 --> 11:03.120
Oh, hey. Uh...

11:03.204 --> 11:05.706
Señor Uhl went totally loco.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.959
He made our entire class
wash and wax his truck.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.419
Same with Miss Janeth.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.297
She flipped a desk
and started eating our test papers.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.634
-[Mary] Like, literally ate them.
-[Coach Lawrence grunting]

11:17.385 --> 11:18.552
-[chuckles]
-[bell rings]

11:18.636 --> 11:20.346
-Come on, Mary.
-[grunts]

11:20.429 --> 11:22.765
-[Mary] My next class is with Señor Uhl.
-Whew!

11:22.848 --> 11:25.351
The power balance has irrevocably shifted.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.395
We have to get the students out of here.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.313
Oh, no. Where did Coach go?

11:29.397 --> 11:32.775
Calm down. We'll call Claire
and portal the teachers to a safe place.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.985
-Yeah.
-[line ringing]

11:35.069 --> 11:37.238
She's not picking up. Any other ideas?

11:37.321 --> 11:41.242
I was saving this one
for Arcadia Fitness Day, but...

11:41.325 --> 11:44.120
-[chalk squeaking]
-[in Spanish] Dead cats.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.916
They taste like candy. [burps]

11:48.999 --> 11:52.795
[Toby, over PA] Attention.
El Guerito Taco Truck is parked outside.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.339
Free tacos for everybody
as long as they last!

11:55.423 --> 11:56.715
[all cheering]

11:57.842 --> 11:59.593

[Strickler] Miss Janeth?

12:07.518 --> 12:08.727

12:09.687 --> 12:12.982
Mm, Strickler. You're back.

12:13.732 --> 12:17.445
I have a feeling Mister Lake
wasn't entirely honest with me.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.696
[Señor Uhl] Adiós.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.448
[Strickler grunts]

12:21.824 --> 12:23.284

-[girl] I'm starving.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.754
-Dude, like, where's my tacos?
-[metal clanging]

12:35.838 --> 12:38.007
Hey, Toby, what are you doing?

12:38.090 --> 12:40.301
-[Seamus] Dude. Dude.
-Let us in. Let us--

12:40.759 --> 12:45.556
Wait. Why am I fighting
to get back into school? [scoffs]

12:45.639 --> 12:46.640
This is ridiculous.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.393
[Mary] Let's just go find those tacos.
I don't even care.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.271
All right, the kids are gone.
That leaves the teachers.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.149
We better hurry before they get stuck
in beast mode forever.

12:55.232 --> 12:58.027
[Strickler over PA]
You've been a bad student, Young Atlas.

12:58.110 --> 12:58.986
Strickler.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.738
[Strickler] When students disobey,

13:00.821 --> 13:03.866
it falls upon their teachers
to dole out punishment.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.535
-Sounds like he got a caffeine fix.
-I'll take Strickler.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.954
-Steve, you handle Coach Lawrence.
-I'm on it.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.998
-Eli, you got Miss Janeth.
-Yes!

13:11.081 --> 13:12.082
Toby, Uhl.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.793
Emotionally connect with Señor Uhl?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.087
He doesn't have emotions!

13:17.671 --> 13:19.924
-[door opens]
-Miss Janeth?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.386
[door closes]

13:25.137 --> 13:28.557
Sounds like you could use a pep talk
from your favorite student?

13:31.268 --> 13:34.063
[growling, grunts]

13:34.146 --> 13:36.857
[Ms. Janeth] "So wise, so young...

13:36.941 --> 13:40.152
-[chortles] they say do never live long."
-[screams]

13:40.236 --> 13:43.822
-[Ms. Janeth cackling]
-[grunting]

13:47.117 --> 13:50.079
[growling, grunting]

13:51.997 --> 13:53.707
[growling]

13:53.791 --> 13:59.255
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth
it is to have a thankless child."

13:59.338 --> 14:00.631
-[growls]
-[screams]

14:02.216 --> 14:03.676
Señor Uhl?

14:03.759 --> 14:06.345
Hola. Señor Uhl?

14:06.428 --> 14:09.390
-[in Spanish] In a place of La Mancha...
-[thunder rumbling]

14:09.473 --> 14:12.101
...whose name
I do not want to remember...

14:12.184 --> 14:14.770
-De La Mancha, de La Mancha...
-Sounding pretty, señor.

14:14.853 --> 14:19.191
So, how does an Austrian dude
become a Spanish teacher?

14:19.275 --> 14:22.820
-I bet it's a beautiful story.
-De la Mancha. De la-- Yeah.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.949
[drawn out, breathless] Whaaat?
Or maybe it's not.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.536
Maybe it's personal. Probably personal.
We don't have to talk about it.

14:30.619 --> 14:31.829
[whimpers]

14:32.496 --> 14:34.081
[exhales]

14:34.164 --> 14:35.124
[growls]

14:35.207 --> 14:36.709
-[grunts]
-[screams]

14:38.460 --> 14:41.213
-Who knew you were so flexible?
-[in Spanish] Little cat.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.465
-[Coach Lawrence panting]
-[whistle blowing]

14:44.842 --> 14:45.676
Coming down.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.470
[sighs]

14:48.554 --> 14:50.055
[inhales]

14:50.139 --> 14:52.725
Coach, wanna talk?

14:52.808 --> 14:54.977
[grunting] Coming down.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.607
[whistle blowing]

14:59.690 --> 15:02.234
You sure seem to like that whistle.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.779
Maybe you can take it out
so we can talk like men.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.075
[metal crunching]

15:10.159 --> 15:11.368
[gulp]

15:13.871 --> 15:15.915
[grunting]

15:17.958 --> 15:21.754
[chuckles] So that's the way
you wanna play it?

15:21.837 --> 15:22.922
Let's dance.

15:23.672 --> 15:28.260
[Strickler] How do you think this is going
to end? This is the real world.

15:28.344 --> 15:32.473
In a war against Gunmar,
there are no happy endings.

15:32.556 --> 15:37.686
I want to teach you, help you,
but you're so blind to the truth.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.604
What truth?

15:38.687 --> 15:42.816
You can't walk away
from a fight with Gunmar.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.611
This isn't you.
It's the Grave Sand talking.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.820
-No.
-[thunder rumbling]

15:46.904 --> 15:50.282
I thought I could burn the weakness
out of you,

15:50.366 --> 15:52.493
but the weakness is you.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.996
-And the world will rot.
-No, it won't.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.581
[snarling]

15:57.665 --> 16:01.126
Then kill me, or I shall kill you,

16:01.210 --> 16:04.129
ending this charade once and for all!

16:04.213 --> 16:06.090
[grunting]

16:06.173 --> 16:07.299
[Eli screams]

16:07.758 --> 16:09.718
[both grunting]

16:16.558 --> 16:20.813
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

16:20.896 --> 16:24.358
"My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
my love as deep.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.903
The more I give to thee,
the more I have, for both are infinite."

16:27.987 --> 16:32.324
You're an amazing teacher, Miss J.
I don't wanna have to slay you.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.494
A student should never have to slay
their favorite teacher.

16:35.577 --> 16:40.958
[grunts] I am your favorite teacher? Oh.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.293
Oh!

16:44.169 --> 16:47.589
Eli? Uh, why are you dipping me
in the theatre?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.925
'Cause "all the world's a stage."

16:50.009 --> 16:51.176
[grunts]

16:51.260 --> 16:52.511
[Señor Uhl] Missy.

16:52.594 --> 16:56.056
Oh, come on, you big Austrian teddy bear.
We must have something in common.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.975
[in Spanish] Oh, little cat.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.518
Come here, little cat.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.521
Tacos, burrito, especial number 32.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.023
-That's all the Spanish I know!
-[meows]

17:05.107 --> 17:07.943
Wait, we both ate
that super spicy burrito, remember?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.779
El Diablo Maximus.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.615
The Devil. Very bad!

17:13.699 --> 17:17.453
Hey, I love Moral Weapon.
That stars an Austrian muscle guy.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.829
-Or Moral Weapon Two.
-[growls]

17:19.913 --> 17:21.080
Yep, no one liked Two.

17:21.165 --> 17:26.170
-Toby, I saved Miss Janeth!
-Good for you. Now save me! [grunts]

17:28.005 --> 17:29.339
[screams]

17:30.466 --> 17:32.426
Okay, this was a mistake.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.261
[both grunting]

17:34.344 --> 17:36.597
[coughs]

17:37.556 --> 17:40.517
Think of your wife, your children.
Do you have either of those?

17:40.601 --> 17:41.810
[screams]

17:42.394 --> 17:45.522
[screams] His truck! He loves his truck!

17:45.606 --> 17:49.026
It has a name, right? Something with an S?
Sally? Samanda?

17:49.109 --> 17:52.112
-Sabena? Shirley? Susan?
-Su...

17:52.196 --> 17:53.572
Susannah! That's it!

17:53.655 --> 17:55.032
Think of Susannah, señor.

17:55.115 --> 17:58.744
Susannah.

17:58.827 --> 18:02.206
[Toby]
Think of Susannah's glorious white paint,

18:02.289 --> 18:04.666
her nearly flawless bumper.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.212
Only a few dings. They're dimples.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.297
She's smiling at you.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.092
You love that truck, don't you?

18:15.219 --> 18:17.387
-Toby?
-[sighs] High five.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.265
Time to whip you into shape.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.558
[both grunting]

18:23.060 --> 18:25.020
-[screams]
-[metal clanging]

18:27.356 --> 18:30.609
You gotta talk to me. No way
I'm bringing you home to Mom like this.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.946
I'm not going home. [grunts] Give me cats!

18:34.530 --> 18:39.034
[grunts] No, you like dogs. And I know
what else you have a soft spot for.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.244
[grunts]

18:40.327 --> 18:43.330
I meant what I said this morning.
You're not my father.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.581
[soles squeaking]

18:44.665 --> 18:49.002
My real dad's never around
and can be a real buttsnack.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.631
But you are--
I mean, you're not a buttsnack.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.175
You're the dude who sticks around...

18:56.135 --> 18:58.178
which makes you cooler than my dad.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.889
[grunts]

19:00.973 --> 19:05.144
You may not be my father, Coach Lawrence,
but you are my friend.

19:07.437 --> 19:11.984
[grunts] You can't resist the love, Coach.
We're gonna... [whimpers]

19:12.067 --> 19:13.277
we're gonna hug it out.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.653
[grunts] Wha--?

19:15.404 --> 19:16.655
Steve...?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.575
[sniffles] Bring it in.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.540
-[clears throat]
-[humming]

19:26.623 --> 19:28.083
[grunting]

19:28.167 --> 19:30.961
If you don't believe in me,
then why train me?

19:31.044 --> 19:33.755
I didn't return to train you.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.717
I returned to protect her.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.554
[both grunting]

19:47.311 --> 19:48.520
[screams]

19:57.154 --> 19:59.031
[thunderclap]

19:59.114 --> 20:01.825
So you do have it in you.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.411
Go on, finish the fight.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.164
No. You wanna live. You wanna help me.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.124
I want nothing.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.627
That's not true. You want... [panting]

20:12.836 --> 20:15.130
you want to protect my mom.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.674
You care for Barbara.

20:17.758 --> 20:23.805
-Remember how happy she made you feel.
-She doesn't even remember me.

20:24.848 --> 20:25.974
She does.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.519
She still cares for you.

20:31.521 --> 20:35.275
She still cares for me?

20:35.859 --> 20:38.862
[sighs] She loves you.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.740
Loves... me?

20:50.666 --> 20:53.543
The Grave Sand. How did you--?

20:53.627 --> 20:56.838
-Let's just say I said what I had to say.
-[door opens]

20:57.422 --> 21:00.133
So there's a couple of teachers
looking for an explanation,

21:00.217 --> 21:02.052
and we don't know what to say. Anyone?

21:02.135 --> 21:04.554
[Strickler]
It's okay. I'll have a word with them.

21:05.138 --> 21:09.017
You've proven yourself today, Young Atlas.
There is hope for you yet.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.727
Yeah, sure.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.188
Wait until Claire hears about this.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.316
I have a feeling she's happy
to have slept through this one.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.485
[thunder rumbling]

21:22.698 --> 21:27.035
Pale Lady, I have come.

21:28.578 --> 21:33.834
[Morgana] You seek magic.
What makes you worthy?

21:34.376 --> 21:39.089
We seek the same thing. The Eternal Night.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.967
[snarling]

21:44.261 --> 21:47.681
Then we shall show you the way.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.516
[Gunmar] We?

21:49.599 --> 21:54.021
My child and my champion.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.651
Angor Rot.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.778
[Morgana] He will rise again.

22:01.862 --> 22:06.992
Together you will free me,
and we shall bring the Night Eternal.
