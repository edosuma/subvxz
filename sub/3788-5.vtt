Do you guys not see the problem here?

01:19.371 --> 01:22.915
Vince said she was staying a couple
of nights, all right? A couple is two.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.542
Except in Utah.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.337
Look at him. She's got him doing fucking
yoga, man. It's embarrassing.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.424
- DRAMA: She thinks she's his trainer.
- So do you.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.385
What? I'm not?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.971
What the fuck did I get certified for then?

01:37.055 --> 01:38.931
Relax, Drama, you're his trainer.

01:39.016 --> 01:42.602
It's all a big joke to E, because he's been
sleeping off campus at Emily's.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.353
You're going to low-jack on me, Turtle?

01:44.438 --> 01:47.231
You guys have idiot girlfriends
who will fuck everything up.

- (GIGGLING) Thanks, baby.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.119
All right.
You ready for a real workout, Vince?

02:00.204 --> 02:02.830
No weights. I just had a mean stretch.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.750
Vince, you got to hit the weights
if you want to put on size.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.920
Bulk is so '90s, Johnny.
It's all about flexibility, don't you think?

02:10.422 --> 02:12.131
Um... No, I don't.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.801
We'll catch you later.
We're gonna go grab breakfast.

I don't trust that New Age bullshit.

even if it is attached to an ass like that.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.352
Yo, E. What up, dawg?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.313
Not much. How about you?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.065

We met at the fight.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.802
Oh, yeah, okay. All right.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.555
Do me a favor.
Put a towel on or something. Cover up.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.765
Not a locker room guy. No problem.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.727
So listen, E,
I didn't want to interrupt Vince's workout...

03:06.812 --> 03:08.688
but I got a great piece of material.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.982
Would you do me a favor
and have him take a look?

03:11.066 --> 03:14.694
You got to understand, the guy gets
hundreds of scripts a week, you know that.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.613
Yet this is something special. It kicks ass.

03:17.781 --> 03:21.325
It's gritty as shit. You'll love it.
I guarantee Vince will flip.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.663
Tell Vince it was a great move
passing on Matterhorn, too.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.457

- Yeah. Script is a piece of shit.

My God. I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

- Come on, Monica.
- I'm done talking to you, Turtle.

04:00.324 --> 04:03.159
You were supposed to hook me up
with some weed two days ago.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.078

but I can't find them anywhere.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.420
I can get those for you in two seconds...

04:14.504 --> 04:17.005
just give me the size and the style number.

for his lady friend ASAP.

- Hey.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.571
- What are you doing?
- Just reading a script.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.033
- Any good?
- It's great so far.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.914
So that's your job? You read some scripts
and tell Vince which the good ones are?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.626
Yes, something like that.

04:53.710 --> 04:57.338
Wow. That's a really cool job.
So did you go to school for that?

04:59.383 --> 05:00.424
No.

05:00.509 --> 05:04.178
I love to read.
I read all the Harry Potter books and...

05:04.262 --> 05:08.015
Um, I don't know. If you need
a second opinion, don't hesitate.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.017
Okay. Cool.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.061
- All right.
- Thanks.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.619
Don't get mad,
but I think she's stealing food.

05:28.704 --> 05:32.373
- She's not stealing food.
- Shit keeps disappearing from the fridge.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.500
Did have an eye on the meatloaf, vanish.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.379
I know how these kleptos work.
First it's the food, then it's the plasma.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.173
All right. She didn't steal it,
she threw it away.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.052
- Thrown it away, why?
- She's vegan.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.682
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Means she's into a cruelty-free lifestyle.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.185
It's cruel to throw away
a $65.00 steak from Morton's.

05:53.270 --> 05:57.189
Just do me a favor, and keep the meat
out of her eye line while she's around.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.400
Look, she's already got him
wearing cloth shoes.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.946
These are my slippers. They are the ones
he stole from the Four Seasons, Maui.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.323
Those are the slippers? Where's the robe?

06:06.408 --> 06:09.910
Fiona just dropped the robe at the pool
and had nothing on underneath.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.871
- She's naked at the pool?
- ERIC: Yeah.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.457
- And you were looking at her?
- She's naked at the pool.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.709
- DRAMA: How's she look?
- Good enough to eat, I bet, huh?

06:16.793 --> 06:19.837

- Sue me, I'm going.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.721
- Vince.
- VINCE: Did you call the Hack?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.891
- Yeah. He's got nothing.
- How can the whole town be out of weed?

06:31.975 --> 06:35.519
Hack said the drought dried up the crops.
It ain't on me. Peace.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.690
- Three days, Vince. Don't bend the rules.
- I made the rules.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.609
Can we talk about something important?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.819
DRAMA: This is important,
it's a lifestyle issue.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.280
Did you see the picture
of the swami in the bathroom?

06:46.364 --> 06:47.406
It's her guru.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.117
I don't like the way he looks at me
when I'm pissing.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.411
- I found your next movie, Vince.
- Yeah?

06:52.496 --> 06:55.247
The script is awesome,
you got to read it now.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.417
FIONA: Vince, I need you.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.213
I'll read it later. All she wants to do is fuck.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.599
The idea is to get as close as possible
without actually touching.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.267
How long do we have to go for?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.728
The longer we hold out, the better the sex.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.147
Sometimes great masters hold out for years.

07:20.232 --> 07:24.110
But they're up in the mountains somewhere
by themselves, whacking off like crazy.

Thanks, Shauna.
Vince's lady friend is going to love these.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.627
- These are not Taiwanese knockoffs?
- Would I do that to you?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.921
No, those are real goods.
Look at the sheepskin.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.465
You can tell these were born
and raised in the outback.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.092
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.220
- Thanks a mil, Shauna.
- Don't thank me, thank Christy.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.973
Christy.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.559
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

If you ever need anything, you know,
concert tickets, pedicure...

08:01.064 --> 08:03.732

All right.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.989
Shauna, what's with the photographer?

08:10.073 --> 08:12.616
I told you, I don't want Vince
posing on these things.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.993
I called back and said...

08:14.077 --> 08:16.620
if he wants the Harley,
he has to take a picture on it.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.039
- We never had that discussion.
- I had it with Turtle.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.834
- And I spoke with Vince.
- That's all I give a shit about:

08:21.918 --> 08:25.254
What Vincent wants. So don't fuck with me
like you're fucking with Ari.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.174
Hey, Eric, I read it, it's awesome.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.926
- Read what?
- The script, it's so good.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.013
- You read it?
- God, it even made me cry. Right, Vince?

08:34.097 --> 08:35.347
Yeah, it did.

08:36.433 --> 08:40.602
Hey, Shauna, just so you know.
Look, you know I love you...

08:41.062 --> 08:44.398
- but I can't take a picture on that thing.
- Turtle said you'd do it.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.735
It's just my girl, she's really conscious
about the environment...

08:47.819 --> 08:49.570
she thinks it sends the wrong message.

08:49.654 --> 08:53.365
I mean, she doesn't mind riding around
in your Hummer. What is she thinking?

08:53.450 --> 08:56.869
I don't know what she is thinking,
but I can't be hassled.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.121
Vince, you're totally fucking me on this.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.625
- I'll take the picture.
- What am I going to do with your picture?

09:02.709 --> 09:06.128
Give me back those Uggs.
I know they're not for him, you fat midget.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.089
You're going to have to pull them
from my cold, dead hands.

- You didn't call bank shot.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.145
- I did. You didn't hear me.
- You got to learn to project.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.522
You hire a vocal coach,
you become a real asshole.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.982
E, the script's great.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.317

- Yeah.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.486
- How many pages?
- The whole thing.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.363
Right. How does it end?

Fiona likes it, you read it in an hour?

09:39.663 --> 09:43.082
- I read it, what's the difference?
- I don't know, but there is one.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.167
Don't worry about that. Let's get it together.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.544
Call Ari and find out
why he doesn't know about it.

09:47.629 --> 09:51.006
- Yeah. Go call Ari, get us paid.
- Shut up, Turtle.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.009
Vince, you seen any juicy parts for me?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.845
- Maybe you could play his father.
- Fuck you.

- Hey.

- EMILY: Hey, you left your wallet at my house.
- Did I?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.981
Yes. Is that your way of saying
you want to come back?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.065
ERIC: Sort of, yeah.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.444
We read a script that we love.
Any way Ari is free for lunch?

10:12.529 --> 10:13.988
Like in December.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.991
Hold on.
Let me just take care of something for you.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.078
All right, I just rescheduled
Anthony LaPaglia.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.539
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tonight?

10:23.623 --> 10:24.999
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.710
- Pussy.
- Faggot.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.381
ARl: Uh...

10:33.300 --> 10:37.261
Yeah, I'll get the Faux Mung Bean Meatloaf.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.346
Okay.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.267
What the fuck are we doing here?
I'm on Atkins, I need protein.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.602
Come on, there's plenty of protein
in mung beans.

10:45.687 --> 10:49.398
I'm talking about real proteins,
like from the flesh of slaughtered animals.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.443
Got to have war paint on them,
blood dripping. It's what I need.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.279
Have you seen a video
of a slaughterhouse, Ari?

10:55.363 --> 10:56.864
Meat is murder.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.575
Even broccoli screams
when you rip it from the ground.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.786
Enough about the fucking menu.
Can we talk about Queens Boulevard?

11:02.871 --> 11:06.749
- Yeah Ari, I really want to do this.
- It's the best script I ever read.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.919
- She's reading your scripts now?
- Vince asked me to.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.129
He did?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.300
Do you guys have a problem with that?

11:16.384 --> 11:19.386
No, if you don't mind it not being printed
on recycled paper.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.763
What's the matter, E?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.807
Did the big words overwhelm you?
Had to pass it along?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.934
Well, I read it.
You didn't even know about it.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.355
I knew about it.
You think you knew about it and I didn't?

11:29.439 --> 11:32.858
You think there is anything in this universe
that you know, that I don't know?

22:53.831 --> 22:54.873
Three.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.834
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

22:58.252 --> 22:59.252
Oh!

22:59.336 --> 23:00.754
That's disgusting.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.088
Hello.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.840
- Mini Vince.
- Hey, Ari.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.675
I don't know who blew who...

23:05.760 --> 23:09.929
but Wick's got a crush on your boy Vince,
wants him to star in his vanity project.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.222
All right, I'll tell him.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.350
Prepare to enter the poor house,
you little bitch.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.271
Wick wants you in the movie.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.776
I don't know, you think I'm Queens enough?

23:22.860 --> 23:23.985
(LAUGHING)

23:24.320 --> 23:25.320
We think.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.448
Get another round here.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.327
