00:32.341 --> 00:35.811
Vast open plains.

00:36.468 --> 00:39.176
Immense spaces.

00:39.860 --> 00:42.160
Eerie silence

00:44.722 --> 00:48.360
but any feeling of emptiness
is an illusion.

00:51.942 --> 00:53.493
The plains of our planet

00:53.594 --> 00:58.059
support the greatest gatherings
of wildlife on Earth.

01:02.668 --> 01:05.034
At the heart of all that happens here

01:05.156 --> 01:08.214
is a single living thing.

01:09.397 --> 01:10.886
Grass.

01:14.536 --> 01:21.041
This miraculous plant
covers a quarter of all the lands of the Earth.

01:35.724 --> 01:37.559
Grasslands exist

01:37.721 --> 01:43.085
where ever there is a little rain,
but not enough to sustain the forests.

01:43.472 --> 01:45.653
Some are huge.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.978
The Central Asian Steppe alone

01:48.121 --> 01:52.831
extends one third of the way
around our planet.

01:57.970 --> 01:59.030
It's summer

01:59.132 --> 02:02.394
and eagles effortlessly cruise the thermals

02:02.517 --> 02:06.330
scanning the ground beneath
for signs of prey.

02:08.654 --> 02:11.346
In the distant reaches of Outer Mongolia

02:11.550 --> 02:16.097
one of the planet's great migrations
is underway.

02:21.970 --> 02:27.007
Few people ever see this extraordinary
annual event.

02:34.798 --> 02:36.939
Mongolian gazelle.

02:37.265 --> 02:42.770
Two million are thought to live here
but no one really knows.

02:44.748 --> 02:48.765
For much of the time
they're scattered through this vast landscape

02:48.888 --> 02:53.027
but once a year they come together
to have their young.

02:54.331 --> 02:59.388
Nearly all will give birth
within the next ten days.

03:03.753 --> 03:08.749
Out in the open, communal calving
is the safest way to have young.

03:09.014 --> 03:11.298
With so many pairs of eyes keeping watch

03:11.379 --> 03:15.335
it's almost impossible for predators
to sneak up.

03:21.433 --> 03:26.469
There are no bushes, no trees,
there's only one thing to hide behind,

03:27.081 --> 03:29.181
grass

03:30.591 --> 03:33.527
and it's not very effective.

03:40.910 --> 03:46.007
Predators also have a hard time
raising their young on open grassland.

03:46.229 --> 03:51.257
Without trees eagles have to nest
directly on the ground.

03:53.888 --> 03:59.799
All inhabitants of the Great Plains
are exposed to the elements.

04:17.140 --> 04:21.019
Fire sparks panic in the herd.

04:27.197 --> 04:32.652
Gazelles are born to run, and even
young calves easily outpace the flames

04:33.000 --> 04:35.755
if they can avoid being trampled.

05:10.451 --> 05:16.923
With nothing to stand in it's way
the blaze consumes anything that can't flee.

05:17.511 --> 05:22.538
Huge quantities of grass,
valuable food have been lost

05:26.817 --> 05:30.696
and with it
the old and the weak.

05:35.403 --> 05:42.088
The gazelles move on to new pastures
and leave the desolation behind them.

05:44.763 --> 05:48.427
From the ashes rises the phoenix.

05:48.828 --> 05:53.267
Grass the incredible survivor.

05:55.220 --> 05:59.419
Because it grows from a protected part
at the base of its stems,

05:59.605 --> 06:03.537
grass is almost indestructible.

06:14.047 --> 06:17.310
Able to repair and reproduce itself rapidly

06:17.390 --> 06:20.974
it covers more of the Earth's land
than any other plant

06:21.348 --> 06:25.227
and feeds more wildlife than any other.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.665
Red billed quelea.

06:47.986 --> 06:52.105
One and a half billion
swarm across the savannas of Africa.

06:52.425 --> 06:57.613
These are the most numerous birds on Earth.

07:00.930 --> 07:07.750
Some flocks are so vast, that they could take
five hours to pass overhead.

07:40.992 --> 07:45.806
Only grass can feed plagues of these proportions.

07:45.994 --> 07:49.765
The ravenous hordes devour the seeds

07:50.300 --> 07:55.969
and the leaves and stems are cropped
by great herds of antelope.

08:06.428 --> 08:13.033
The East African savannas alone
sustain nearly two million wildebeest.

08:25.016 --> 08:29.402
They trim the grass down to it's roots
leaving little in their wake

08:29.857 --> 08:37.639
but within days the plant will recover
and continue to sustain the biggest herds on Earth.

08:48.605 --> 08:52.990
Grass is not confined to the tropics.

08:56.681 --> 09:01.923
It manages to grow
even in the bitter conditions of the Arctic.

09:09.678 --> 09:15.723
Beyond the limits of the last tree
the planet is barren and ice locked.

09:16.045 --> 09:20.029
The frozen no man's land
at the end of the Earth.

09:20.671 --> 09:28.106
But, for a short time each year,
the long dark winter releases it's grip.

09:38.964 --> 09:44.500
Temperatures rise, and grass that has lain dormant
and frozen throughout the winter

09:44.634 --> 09:47.469
sprouts once more.

09:51.854 --> 09:55.385
Green returns to the Arctic.

09:56.294 --> 10:01.990
The receding ice reveals an immense
flat plain, the size of Australia.

10:02.178 --> 10:05.681
This is the Arctic tundra.

10:11.806 --> 10:15.122
It's a desolate silent wilderness

10:15.336 --> 10:18.652
but it's about to change.

10:34.939 --> 10:37.506
Snow geese.

10:38.978 --> 10:41.652
They winter along the Gulf of Mexico

10:41.653 --> 10:48.498
and in spring they fly the entire length
of North America to reach the Arctic tundra.

10:49.380 --> 10:54.515
Five million birds make this journey
every year.

11:10.481 --> 11:15.028
Their marathon migration
is almost three thousand miles long

11:15.081 --> 11:18.451
and has taken them three months.

11:24.441 --> 11:29.710
Exhausted and starving,
they touch down inside the Arctic Circle

11:29.790 --> 11:34.122
back at their traditional breeding grounds,
at last.

11:35.674 --> 11:37.921
Snow geese pair for life.

11:38.215 --> 11:44.259
As soon as couples arrive,
they must stake a claim to a nesting patch.

11:47.255 --> 11:53.487
Ideal sites are in short supply
and quarrelsome neighbors are all around.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.343
Disputes can be vicious.

12:33.818 --> 12:35.931
Point taken.

12:37.856 --> 12:44.649
It's a long way to travel, but for a short period
the tundra is the ideal place for a grazer.

12:44.890 --> 12:48.447
The grass grows vigorously
during the short intense summer

12:48.580 --> 12:52.405
and the are fewer predators
than farther south.

12:56.150 --> 13:00.108
Here, geese can nest on the ground
in relative safety

13:00.535 --> 13:04.681
nonetheless this female must
incubate her eggs for three weeks

13:04.788 --> 13:09.013
and throughout this time
she will be very vulnerable.

13:22.841 --> 13:25.783
An Arctic fox surveys the colony.

13:25.943 --> 13:29.340
She's been waiting for the geese all winter.

13:34.635 --> 13:38.406
Sneaking up unnoticed is impossible.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.644
Perhaps fortune will favor the bold.

14:06.300 --> 14:11.301
The colony is well defended.
There are no easy pickings here.

14:22.561 --> 14:28.310
She's driven away from every nest,
but hunger compels her to continue.

14:56.692 --> 15:00.350
There are more eggs here
than she can possibly eat now

15:00.351 --> 15:03.068
but the nesting season is short

15:03.281 --> 15:06.834
so she stashes much of her plunder
for later in the year

15:06.876 --> 15:09.529
when all the geese have gone.

15:21.083 --> 15:26.453
Further south, other bigger
predators prowl the tundra.

15:28.378 --> 15:29.641
Wolves.

15:29.812 --> 15:34.412
For them, finding food on the plains
is an even greater challenge.

15:34.605 --> 15:38.435
Not only is their prey seasonal
it's also hard to find.

15:38.498 --> 15:42.200
They've been searching for days
without a sign.

15:49.011 --> 15:54.608
Somewhere in this immense landscape
there is food for them.

16:01.069 --> 16:03.979
This is it.
Caribou.

16:05.969 --> 16:08.045
Travelling thirty miles a day

16:08.151 --> 16:13.906
they can cover nearly two thousand miles
during the summer months.

16:21.010 --> 16:24.519
The wolves will starve
if they don't find the caribou

16:24.883 --> 16:30.423
but it's no easy task
to locate prey that never stops traveling.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.858
Biting flies and the quest for new pasture

16:53.923 --> 16:57.281
drives the migration ever onwards.

17:34.044 --> 17:38.131
A wolf has finally picked up the trail.

17:39.007 --> 17:41.703
The caribou are close.

17:45.987 --> 17:48.575
At last, a chance.

17:51.443 --> 17:54.416
The hunt is on.

18:04.772 --> 18:09.928
The wolf panics the herd,
and the weak and young are singled out.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.924
A calf is separated from it's mother.

18:59.341 --> 19:04.390
At the goose colony it's high summer
and eggs are hatching.

19:06.680 --> 19:11.280
The young all emerge within a day or two.
A marvel of timing.

19:11.365 --> 19:16.116
The colony is now home
to a million goslings.

19:31.970 --> 19:36.442
The fox is still gathering all she can get.

19:40.420 --> 19:45.042
Sometimes one mouth simply isn't enough.

20:19.991 --> 20:23.008
One will have to do.

20:28.592 --> 20:30.688
Not all food is stored.

20:30.924 --> 20:33.427
Some is needed right now.

20:34.926 --> 20:38.392
She has seven hungry cubs to feed.

20:44.725 --> 20:49.474
As their appetites grow, the mother
must work tirelessly to raise her family.

20:49.838 --> 20:54.546
Only fat healthy cubs
will survive the Arctic winter.

21:10.271 --> 21:14.058
The vast majority of the goslings
are still flourishing.

21:14.379 --> 21:17.438
Their parents lead them down
to the safety of the water

21:17.525 --> 21:20.820
as soon as they're strong enough
to make the journey.

21:26.468 --> 21:30.362
For the foxes
boom time has come to an end

21:30.705 --> 21:35.819
but the mother has given her cubs
the best possible start in life.

21:38.066 --> 21:40.697
The geese will continue grazing the tundra

21:40.783 --> 21:45.725
until the summer ends,
and they're forced to head south for the winter.

21:53.791 --> 21:56.980
At these latitudes the Sun's rays are week

21:57.043 --> 22:00.295
and grass can only grow here
for a few months a year

22:00.638 --> 22:06.565
but further south summers are longer
and the grasslands flourish.

22:20.856 --> 22:24.022
The prairies of North America.

22:25.777 --> 22:32.495
This rich pasture once supported
the greatest herds ever seen on our planet.

22:42.124 --> 22:44.777
There were once sixty million bison

22:45.040 --> 22:48.751
but no animal is immune
to intensive hunting by man

22:48.925 --> 22:51.237
or the destruction of it's habitat

22:51.562 --> 22:56.800
and a century ago the bison were reduced
to barely a thousand.

22:57.416 --> 23:02.670
Now, thanks to rigorous protection,
the species is recovering.

23:07.634 --> 23:09.620
The growing season is long

23:09.757 --> 23:14.053
and the grass here can support herds
all year around.

23:19.753 --> 23:23.450
Male bison weigh in at one ton.

23:39.607 --> 23:43.030
In high summer the bulls are fat
from the rich grazing

23:43.150 --> 23:46.659
and in prime condition
but only a few will mate.

23:46.865 --> 23:50.579
Exactly which few
is about to be decided.

24:22.868 --> 24:30.022
On temperate plains around the world
summer is a time for growth and reproduction.

24:32.316 --> 24:36.116
Now the grass produces it's flowers.

24:48.663 --> 24:52.994
New colors also come to the plains.

25:30.033 --> 25:35.767
The northern flowering is mirrored
by the grasslands of the southern hemisphere.

25:36.024 --> 25:41.467
And nowhere is more impressive
than on the velt of South Africa.

26:29.617 --> 26:35.796
Not all temperate plains
are so rich and colorful in the summer.

26:42.693 --> 26:46.493
This is midsummer on the Tibetan Plateau

26:46.527 --> 26:49.762
the highest great plain in the world.

26:51.064 --> 26:55.547
Despite the conditions, grass survives,
and in sufficient quantities

26:55.633 --> 26:59.227
to support the highest of all grazing herds

26:59.432 --> 27:01.830
those of the wild yak.

27:04.893 --> 27:07.632
Even in summer life is hard

27:07.803 --> 27:12.904
temperatures rarely rise above freezing,
and the air is thin.

27:19.408 --> 27:24.903
It's also exceptionally dry
for one very big reason

27:28.189 --> 27:30.157
the Himalayas.

27:32.365 --> 27:35.464
The great mountain range acts as a barrier

27:35.601 --> 27:38.322
preventing clouds moving in from the south

27:38.458 --> 27:44.586
and this casts a giant rain shadow
that leaves Tibet high and dry.

28:03.242 --> 28:05.569
Grass clings to life

28:05.672 --> 28:11.902
even as desiccating winds remove
what little moisture remains in the soil.

28:20.990 --> 28:25.834
So long as grass can survive,
so can grazers.

28:30.746 --> 28:32.731
Wild ass.

28:41.546 --> 28:44.302
The males are fighting to win territories

28:44.593 --> 28:49.932
those that hold the best,
are more likely to attract a herd of females.

29:06.019 --> 29:09.219
It's a frisky business.

29:13.634 --> 29:15.397
That counts as a victory

29:15.568 --> 29:19.522
but he can't assume the females
will actually turn up.

29:24.419 --> 29:28.098
Female asses are mysterious creatures.

29:30.648 --> 29:35.938
They come and go as they please
and much of their behavior seems unfathomable

29:36.143 --> 29:38.060
to an outsider.

29:49.631 --> 29:52.095
They're the great nomads of the plateau

29:52.387 --> 29:59.234
and will often trek vast distances across these
parched plains in search of oases.

30:00.569 --> 30:02.931
But when they do find paradise

30:03.050 --> 30:06.473
they're liable to feed and drink
for just a few hours

30:06.611 --> 30:11.233
and then head back to the dust
for no apparent reason.

30:15.649 --> 30:20.870
Wild ass are the most conspicuous pioneers
of this high frontier

30:21.041 --> 30:25.919
but the most numerous grazer in Tibet
lives underground.

30:29.308 --> 30:30.044
Pika

30:30.488 --> 30:34.700
A relative of the rabbit.
It too feeds on grass.

30:40.433 --> 30:42.556
On the exposed plateau

30:42.709 --> 30:45.465
pikas never stray far from their burrows

30:45.654 --> 30:51.336
but even so, squatters will move in
given half a chance.

31:03.985 --> 31:08.024
While ground peckers and snow finches
can be a nuisance

31:08.111 --> 31:13.844
they're worth tolerating, because they provide
a valuable early warning system.

31:27.333 --> 31:32.263
The bizarre Tibetan fox.
The pika's nemesis.

31:56.428 --> 32:00.176
When stalking, it keeps below the skyline

32:00.502 --> 32:04.148
perhaps helped by it's curious body shape.

32:04.799 --> 32:07.212
But why the square head?

33:00.964 --> 33:04.421
In summer, the Tibetan plateau heats up

33:04.541 --> 33:07.657
drawing in warm wet air from the south

33:07.930 --> 33:10.531
but the water never arrives.

33:10.720 --> 33:15.016
As the moist air approaches
it's forced upwards by the Himalayas

33:15.101 --> 33:18.970
and condenses into huge rain clouds.

33:33.690 --> 33:38.756
These clouds drop all their water
on the southern side of the mountains.

33:39.053 --> 33:41.833
The very peaks that keep Tibet dry

33:41.855 --> 33:48.637
are responsible for the monsoon rains
falling farther south, and the greening of India.

33:58.545 --> 34:02.396
Here, soaked by rain and bathed in tropical sun

34:02.524 --> 34:06.226
grass reaches it's full potential.

34:08.150 --> 34:12.366
Elephant grass is the tallest in the world.

34:24.667 --> 34:31.235
Grass that towers over an elephant,
can conceal all sorts of surprises.

34:39.623 --> 34:41.996
The male lesser florican.

34:42.190 --> 34:48.373
It's hard work getting noticed
when you go courting in the high grass.

35:01.382 --> 35:06.025
The long grass plains of tropical India
are home to some of the largest

35:06.026 --> 35:08.314
grass eating mammals on our planet...

35:09.020 --> 35:11.930
and some of the smallest.

35:13.490 --> 35:16.657
Pygmy hogs are no bigger than rabbits.

35:16.658 --> 35:21.279
They're the tiniest and rarest
of all wild pigs.

35:25.707 --> 35:31.120
The female is busy collecting grass
but not for eating.

35:38.692 --> 35:40.938
She's building a nest.

35:55.616 --> 35:59.938
Each piglet may be small enough
to fit in the palm of a hand

36:00.194 --> 36:02.590
but she does have ten.

36:16.670 --> 36:22.340
This is how grass can grow
given unlimited sunshine and water

36:22.772 --> 36:25.896
but on most tropical plains
across our planet

36:26.003 --> 36:29.598
the wet season is followed
by a dry one.

36:39.588 --> 36:46.499
On the African savannas, grazers are marching
in search of grass and water.

37:07.402 --> 37:15.040
Without rain, these plains can become dust bowls.
Grass can now loose it's hold.

37:24.668 --> 37:27.450
Elephants are in immediate danger.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.895
They must drink almost daily.

37:36.200 --> 37:42.576
Driven on by thirst, they march hundreds of miles
across the parched plains.

38:00.804 --> 38:07.287
Relying on memory, the matriarchs lead
their families to those special water holes

38:07.373 --> 38:10.218
that saved them in previous years.

38:16.872 --> 38:19.419
This one still has water

38:19.461 --> 38:26.265
but they must share what remains
with desperately thirsty animals of all kinds.

38:43.275 --> 38:46.398
These are tense times.

39:02.830 --> 39:05.612
The elephants dominate the water hole

39:05.805 --> 39:10.554
but as night falls
the balance of power will shift.

39:23.541 --> 39:27.905
Thirsty herds continue to arrive
throughout the night.

39:28.054 --> 39:31.221
It's a cooler time to travel.

39:51.378 --> 39:55.015
In the darkness the tables turn.

39:58.786 --> 40:02.664
The elephant's night vision
is little better than our own

40:06.060 --> 40:10.473
but lions have much more sensitive eyes.

40:23.496 --> 40:27.107
The cats are hungry
and the elephants seem to sense it.

41:08.990 --> 41:16.986
Lions don't usually hunt elephants,
but desperate times require desperate measures.

41:17.092 --> 41:21.933
This herd contains calves
easier targets.

41:26.079 --> 41:28.940
But how to reach them?

41:44.089 --> 41:46.523
The adults encircle their young.

41:46.524 --> 41:50.294
It's an impenetrable wall of grey.

42:18.542 --> 42:22.848
A few exhausted stragglers are still arriving.

42:26.646 --> 42:30.043
One of them is alone.

42:49.540 --> 42:54.114
But it's too big for the lions to tackle.

42:58.606 --> 43:01.949
This one looks a little smaller.

43:14.788 --> 43:18.397
A solitary lion stands no chance

43:19.040 --> 43:21.232
but the whole pride is here.

43:25.137 --> 43:29.818
There are thirty of them,
and they're specialist elephant hunters.

44:37.951 --> 44:43.754
This elephant will feed the whole pride
for at least a week.

44:53.223 --> 44:59.427
Elephants know these drinking holes
are dangerous, but they have no choice.

44:59.801 --> 45:03.866
The dramas that play out here
are a savage reminder

45:03.974 --> 45:09.295
of how important water is
for all life on these plains.

45:17.907 --> 45:21.356
As the dry season finally draws to a close

45:21.436 --> 45:26.865
Africa's baked savannas undergo a radical change.

45:28.310 --> 45:35.451
Rain sweeps across the continent
and grass, the great survivor, rises again

45:35.931 --> 45:39.007
and the herds return.

45:41.013 --> 45:48.502
For months they've been scattered over huge areas,
clinging to existence around tiny water holes.

45:48.662 --> 45:52.781
Now, the good times are back.

45:57.755 --> 46:01.740
A few African savannas are very special.

46:02.008 --> 46:08.025
Here, rain water from far and wide
flows across the flat plains.

46:08.346 --> 46:12.598
Grass is submerged but still it grows.

46:33.566 --> 46:40.921
Flooded, burnt, baked and frozen
grass can withstand it all.

46:45.573 --> 46:52.207
After six months of drought,
grass replaces dust over great areas.

47:02.744 --> 47:08.040
Fresh new shoots draw animals
from great distances.

47:19.326 --> 47:24.915
Many undertake epic migrations
to catch the boom time.

47:32.378 --> 47:37.700
Some resourceful animals live here
all the year round.

47:44.787 --> 47:49.547
Baboons are permanent residents
but they have to change their behavior

47:49.601 --> 47:54.522
if they are to gather what they need
on the newly flooded plains.

47:59.122 --> 48:05.701
There's plenty to eat but getting to it
can be a little uncomfortable.

48:55.793 --> 48:59.698
New water poses problems for the youngsters

48:59.885 --> 49:03.897
but they know where to find a dry seat.

49:12.749 --> 49:18.927
A juicy snail is ample recompense
for sodden paws.

49:29.599 --> 49:36.552
Having survived the dry barren times
animals can now reap the rewards.

49:42.516 --> 49:48.908
On this seasonal planet, the great plains
are lands of feast and famine.

49:49.682 --> 49:53.935
At their peak they support
the greatest gatherings of wildlife

49:54.096 --> 49:57.840
found anywhere on Earth.

49:58.305 --> 50:04.446
