00:35.098 --> 00:37.098
I'll be right back with your drinks.

00:44.956 --> 00:46.456
One more day to go.

00:46.989 --> 00:50.289
Thanks for switching shifts with Ivan.
- Christmas requires an optimist.

00:51.059 --> 00:52.059
Give me a high-fiver.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.900
I need three more reindeer waffles
and a Christmas wrap.

00:57.312 --> 01:00.712
I'm running out of antlers. I mean bacon.
Bacon and antlers, you know what I mean.

01:37.706 --> 01:40.706
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

01:44.184 --> 01:45.184
My goodness.

01:53.456 --> 01:58.089
It's killing me to leave my baby behind. But I
can't bear the thought to see her suffer ...

01:58.839 --> 02:03.239
as I have suffered the past few years.
Please tell het that I love her...

02:04.437 --> 02:07.437
and that I pray to hold her again some day.

02:08.985 --> 02:10.985
That will forever be my hope.

03:11.546 --> 03:13.479
Hope Jensen.
EDITOR IN CHIEF.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.148
No.
Yeah, right.

05:20.229 --> 05:21.729
Debate, but no.

05:23.868 --> 05:24.868
Hope?

05:29.737 --> 05:31.937
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

05:32.364 --> 05:33.964
I'm okay.
I wanna be here.

05:34.622 --> 05:37.122
No, you don't. Trust me,
nobody wants to be here.

05:37.205 --> 05:40.005
No, really. One day alone
on the couch was enough.

05:41.945 --> 05:42.945
I'm so sorry, girl.

05:47.549 --> 05:49.349
So, how is the dating?

05:49.439 --> 05:52.639
O, pretty good. I just matched with a guy
who works at Ikea.

05:52.655 --> 05:53.655
Is he cute?

05:53.809 --> 05:58.209
O, no! But I do need help putting together
my new bookshelf, so...

05:58.495 --> 06:01.395
Where is the colophon?
What does he want?

06:01.535 --> 06:03.068
Hope! Is Hope there?

06:03.477 --> 06:07.677
Tell him we had to adjust it to accomodate
the new banner ads.

06:08.099 --> 06:09.599
Hope!

06:11.483 --> 06:12.483
Welcome back!

06:13.171 --> 06:15.171
What kind of graphics designer would do this?

06:16.394 --> 06:17.394
Hope!

06:18.509 --> 06:19.609
What's going on?

06:19.665 --> 06:22.665
Uhm, they had to adjust the mass head
to accomodate the new banner ads.

06:22.738 --> 06:25.238
What? Allright.

06:26.707 --> 06:29.707
How is it going fact checking that
cryptocurrency fraud story?

06:30.103 --> 06:33.703
I'll get right on it this morning.
- O, 'cause you weren't here yesterday.

06:34.404 --> 06:36.404
Sorry to hear about your mom.

06:36.932 --> 06:39.732
Do you need more time off?
- No.

06:39.822 --> 06:43.922
Good. 'Cause we've got a lot of work.
I just scheduled a pitch meeting to discuss...

06:43.990 --> 06:47.090
story ideas for the Christmas season.
I'd like you to be there.

06:47.136 --> 06:48.136
I'd love to.

06:49.066 --> 06:53.166
To serve peppermint hot chocolate. Because
I think that will up the Christmas quotient in here.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.554
People will think I'm a swell guy.
- Okay.

06:57.076 --> 07:00.076
Shall I get some whipped cream?

07:02.567 --> 07:06.867
O, and book me a table at Farinelli's. I wanna
take our precious writers out to lunch.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.511
Okay.
- Goodbye.

07:15.620 --> 07:19.820
I want my mother to be proud.
Instead, I only serve hot chocolate and make reservations.

07:20.442 --> 07:22.742
Where?
- At Farinelli's.

07:22.906 --> 07:27.606
O, no I got food poisoning there once.
- And I'm tired of being nothing more than his assistant.

07:28.215 --> 07:32.015
I took this job because I wanna be a journalist.
I wanna be at Farinelli's.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.943
You want food poisoning?
- Yes!

07:34.114 --> 07:36.214
No.
You know what I mean.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.790
You march into his office right now,
and you tell him what you told me.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.790
You're right. Here I go. I'm going.
- Yeah. You tell him, girl.

07:48.015 --> 07:50.015
What?
- He's at Farinelli's.

07:50.479 --> 07:51.479
I'll tell him tomorrow.

07:53.282 --> 07:55.982
Hope.
Your mom was already proud of you.

08:00.887 --> 08:02.387
Whoa! A match.

08:21.354 --> 08:22.754
Hello?

08:52.197 --> 08:56.497
They make me write this list of how and why,
but you're never gonna see your stuff again.

08:57.087 --> 08:58.087
I figured.

08:58.821 --> 09:02.621
And I mean, the door, you've got a single
bolt lock on that. No security system.

09:02.939 --> 09:06.039
You couldn't have made it any easier
for these guys if you tried.

09:06.084 --> 09:07.084
Excuse me?

09:07.231 --> 09:11.531
There is always an increase in breakings this
time of the year. You cannot stay here tonight.

09:14.465 --> 09:17.965
Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know. Parents, family?

09:20.054 --> 09:21.054
I'm all alone.

09:23.870 --> 09:24.870
O, okay ....  uh...

09:28.566 --> 09:30.766
I'm sorry, I just need a minute.
- That's okay, yeah.

10:08.698 --> 10:12.698
Someone left this at my door. Did you see
it when you came in?

10:15.035 --> 10:16.435
Christmas Jar.

10:17.056 --> 10:19.056
I'm looking for stuff that was stolen, right?

10:19.060 --> 10:21.160
Yeah, maybe one of the
neighbours dropped it.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.733
Well, I'll ask around.

10:24.304 --> 10:28.904
What? you don't go knocking on people's doors
saying "Hey, did you drop a jar full of cash?"

10:31.088 --> 10:32.788
Why not?
- Why not?

10:34.194 --> 10:37.694
Because the first person you ask is gonna take it
from you, before you can finish the sentence.

10:39.261 --> 10:43.761
I think people are better than that.
- I don't know what world you live in, but they're not.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.880
Thank you so much.

11:04.904 --> 11:08.104
I don't pay you much, but please tell me
about secretly living here?

11:08.982 --> 11:13.382
Uhm, I was just getting caught up in some stuff.
- O, that's the thing about working the news.

11:13.493 --> 11:15.893
You can never get caught up,
it's always breaking.

11:15.945 --> 11:18.845
That's what I love about it.
- I can get any coffee?

11:19.217 --> 11:24.017
Can I talk to you first?
- Weren't we just talking?

11:26.106 --> 11:29.206
I've worked hard as your assistant.
And I've learned a lot.

11:29.420 --> 11:36.320
Oh, you're not quitting on me. I don't have time to train...
- No. I wanna be considered for a writing assignment.

11:36.773 --> 11:39.473
I've payed my dues.
And I'm ready for the next step.

11:40.860 --> 11:48.560
You have payed your dues, of course. Because
you are 22 and you have been here a ... year?

11:48.587 --> 11:49.587
Almost.

11:51.417 --> 11:54.417
You were 21 when you got your
first byline at the Boston Globe.

11:55.097 --> 12:00.197
Sure I did that.
Let's revisit this conversation in 6 months.

12:00.292 --> 12:04.592
If you're still here then,
I will give you a shot.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.591
What if I'm not?
What if I've moved on to a competitor's website?

12:10.701 --> 12:13.401
O, I guess we've just have to
manage without you?

12:14.321 --> 12:16.221
Yeah, that's what we do.

12:25.489 --> 12:29.489
It is November 30th, people. Alright.

12:29.932 --> 12:37.132
And I'm gonna be running two full weeks
of Christmas theme content starting on the tenth.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.590
I need to hear some solid pitches starting now.

12:42.264 --> 12:44.264
I'm gonna go to .... Rory!

12:44.865 --> 12:48.265
We've got the year's latest gifts and gadgets?
- Next!

12:48.515 --> 12:53.715
A Christmas tipping guide.
Who in your life you should be tipping and how much?

12:54.345 --> 12:57.745
Well, here's a tip: no! But I do like the elf ears.
- Really?

12:57.882 --> 13:02.282
Because I've got a whole bunch of them at home.
I''ll bring them to the Christmas party.

13:02.632 --> 13:06.132
Okay, that'll be great. How about an idea
though in the mean time?

13:06.816 --> 13:11.016
What have we got?
Chester, quit the drinking, get to thinking.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.908
Rory, my golden girl.
- There's a new diet: the eggnog Christmas cleanse.

13:16.764 --> 13:20.564
That is disgusting.
- It's basically keto, and it's delicious!

13:21.134 --> 13:24.234
That's basically boring and
we ran fat diets last year.

13:24.311 --> 13:26.711
Stevie?
- Top ten Christmas movies to watch with the family?

13:26.737 --> 13:29.137
Not bad.
- It's not a great idea.

13:29.299 --> 13:33.299
Morgana, I gave you those extra few seconds.
Lay it on me. Nothing?

13:33.705 --> 13:38.005
Then it's up to my girl.
Rory, give me something!

13:38.412 --> 13:42.012
Gift cards.
Good idea, or lazy and impersonal?

13:42.509 --> 13:48.909
Lazy and impersonal. Guys, these are all
derivative, boring, uninspiring click-bait.

13:49.169 --> 13:56.669
All of these! What I want and what I need
are stories with heart, tradition, Christmas spirit!

13:57.344 --> 14:02.344
You know what? Maybe it is time to give
Hope a crack at this.

14:04.094 --> 14:07.994
Me?
- Yeah. Do you have any stories, Hope?

14:08.158 --> 14:11.858
Of course I do.
- Tomorrow we're all gonna come back here ....

14:11.898 --> 14:17.398
with some fresh pitches, and I'm very much looking
forward to what you have, Hope.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.449
Guys, got to go. Work on it!
Think, think, think.

14:24.344 --> 14:27.444
I saw this really cute guy this morning,
speaking of cute guys...

14:29.156 --> 14:30.656
Brandi!

14:31.291 --> 14:33.291
I've told you about that Christmas jar, right?

14:33.333 --> 14:37.733
Well, I done some research and I've discovered
a message board for Jar-recepients.

14:37.849 --> 14:40.249
These people wanted to thank
whoever gave them a Christmas jar.

14:40.353 --> 14:42.953
From all over the country?
- No, everyone is local.

14:43.007 --> 14:47.207
They give away the jars anonymously in december
to someone going through a rough time.

14:48.871 --> 14:51.871
Like you.
- No. Kind of amazing, right?  Wait.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.367
Brandi, that's it. That's my story.

14:56.349 --> 14:57.949
Very good! Yeah, it is.

15:03.148 --> 15:05.548
So, one more time, from the top.

15:06.927 --> 15:12.427
Just the words Christmas jar written on the glass.
No other notes, nothing on the bag?

15:13.116 --> 15:15.716
No.
- And you didn't see anyone or hear anything?

15:16.306 --> 15:18.406
Nothing.
- Maybe it's a friend of your mom's.

15:18.645 --> 15:20.845
Maybe.
- Or someone who saw the police at your door.

15:22.607 --> 15:25.207
And knew something bad was happening.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.692
Yeah, maybe.
- How many other jars do you think are out there?

15:28.729 --> 15:31.029
Well, I've only been able to track twelve sofar.

15:31.799 --> 15:35.699
Nine years ago was the earliest one I found,
but I believe I'm only scratching the surface.

15:36.275 --> 15:38.575
Do you think it's the same person,
giving away all these jars?

15:39.079 --> 15:40.879
How is she supposed to know that?

15:41.130 --> 15:45.430
I think it must have been the same person in the
beginning, but this whole thing is totally snowballed.

15:46.156 --> 15:50.456
There were some people who found a jar,
have now been inspired to start giving their own.

15:50.553 --> 15:52.253
That's what I would do.
- Me too.

15:52.765 --> 15:56.065
Only I would decorate mine with rhinestones
over purple glitter.

15:56.151 --> 15:58.851
O, Come on, Rory. It's supposed
to be a Christmas jar!

15:58.945 --> 16:02.245
So what?!
- What you're describing is not traditional.

16:02.592 --> 16:05.292
Uh, says the guy with the hairy Hoggit feet slippers.

16:08.607 --> 16:09.607
Hope.
- Yes.

16:10.277 --> 16:13.077
Where do you think this idea came from?
- I don't know.

16:13.088 --> 16:15.488
And that's what I want to figure out
and write about.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.608
It's like there's a Christmas angel out there.

16:25.498 --> 16:28.498
Still got a lot of holes.
- Yeah.

16:29.427 --> 16:35.527
But, it is an intriguing story.
You've got two weeks, kid.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.750
Do not mess it up.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.566
And still get me my coffee.
- Thank you, Lyle.

16:43.206 --> 16:44.206
Yeah!

16:47.330 --> 16:48.330
Bravo!

16:51.531 --> 16:53.831
Hi, this is Hope Jensen from City Buzz.

16:54.545 --> 16:58.845
I saw your post of a Christmas jar you found in your mailbox.
I was wondering if I could interview you.

16:59.611 --> 17:02.811
Yeah, I was wondering if I could interview you about
a Christmas jar you found in the mailbox.

17:04.878 --> 17:08.378
Hi, this is Hope Jensen from City Buzz.
Yes.

17:13.828 --> 17:16.328
I count it will take ten minutes.
O, sorry, can you hang on a second?

17:18.306 --> 17:22.806
Hello. Wouldn't it be nice to hear an uplifting story for a change?  I'll buy you lunch.

17:23.568 --> 17:25.367
Someone say lunch?

17:26.060 --> 17:28.560
Or a pony. Yeah. Hello?

17:33.535 --> 17:36.035
A pony?
- I could be bribed with a pony.

17:36.079 --> 17:37.079
Yeah.

17:37.217 --> 17:41.817
The same people that posted their story online, won't
talk to me. It seems they're keeping it all a mystery.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.687
Keep your chin up.
You don't want one of those double...

17:48.184 --> 17:49.184
It's called a wattle.

17:51.145 --> 17:56.145
Actually the correct term is a caruncle.
Also known as a doolap or a snooder.

17:59.497 --> 18:02.297
Hey, how was your date last night?
- That was a no-show.

18:02.323 --> 18:04.423
O, I'm sorry.
- O, no. I backed out.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.960
He texted me like five times yesterday.
I cannot deal with that level of crazy.

18:10.611 --> 18:13.311
Hi.
- What?

18:15.090 --> 18:17.790
Nothing, just hey.
- Yeah, you said that.

18:17.873 --> 18:20.973
I brought you a muffin.
- I'm gluten-free.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.435
Of course you are.
Gluten is bad.

18:26.846 --> 18:31.546
Hey, thanks. Bye, Steve.
- Bye, then.

18:41.140 --> 18:44.140
What about Steve?
- I swipe left.

18:46.043 --> 18:51.143
O! Dear Hope, I got your email and would be
happy to do an interview about the Christmas jar.

18:51.553 --> 18:53.253
There you go!
- Did it.

18:53.310 --> 18:55.610
High five!
Yeah!

18:59.816 --> 19:04.416
Alright. Your homework is due tomorrow.
You better be able to name all 96 countries.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.987
Hi! Come on in.
Have a seat.

19:11.046 --> 19:12.846
Here?
- Yeah.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.181
O! No phones in my classroom.

19:27.155 --> 19:28.755
Also, no chewing gum.

19:29.676 --> 19:31.276
Should I...?
- Yes.

19:34.878 --> 19:37.678
Sorry.
- That's okay, this time.

19:45.182 --> 19:49.182
I love to think that whoever gave me my jar...

19:49.335 --> 19:52.535
will read your article and know
how much it meant to me.

19:53.001 --> 19:54.401
I'd like that too.

19:54.435 --> 19:59.335
I was just a teachers assistant back then
and I had just said my goodbyes for the last time.

20:00.652 --> 20:03.552
It's hard for children to understand
budget cuts...

20:04.939 --> 20:07.239
but I did my best, as I always do.

20:08.755 --> 20:14.155
I promised to put the tears on the inside
as I packed up things into my bag...

20:16.130 --> 20:19.430
but then my bag was really heavy,
and that's when I found it.

20:21.047 --> 20:24.647
Was there...
- Whoa.  We put our hands up when we ask questions.

20:28.181 --> 20:30.681
I'm just kidding!
No, I'm not.

20:34.148 --> 20:36.948
Yes I am. I'm confused.
What's your question?

20:37.721 --> 20:40.421
Was there a note with your jar?
- Yes, there was.

20:40.483 --> 20:43.483
The note said "Merry Christmas,
you will be missed."

20:45.330 --> 20:49.330
And then came the waterworks.
Tears of gratitude. Does that make sense?

20:50.081 --> 20:54.081
Of course.
- And the funny thing is, that I wasn't really into Christmas...

20:54.167 --> 20:55.767
before all of this.
- And now?

20:56.393 --> 20:58.493
And now I can't get enough of it!

21:00.236 --> 21:04.236
These jars are proof that the magic of Christmas
is real.

21:05.119 --> 21:08.319
O, and I started my own Christmas jars

21:11.061 --> 21:15.361
But I already gave this Christmas jar away last week,
so this one is for next year.

21:17.367 --> 21:21.367
Yeah, I'd love to...
For your jar.

21:23.419 --> 21:25.719
Contagious, you know.
- What is?

21:26.612 --> 21:27.612
Kindness.

21:30.743 --> 21:34.543
I know I have this amazing story,
but I still don't know who's behind it.

21:34.731 --> 21:36.931
What if they don't want their story told?

21:37.013 --> 21:38.713
That's her job, Cynthia.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.541
You said yourself this tradition
has been going on for years.

21:41.609 --> 21:44.309
If they wanted, don't you think they
would have come forward by now?

21:44.397 --> 21:47.697
Well, maybe nobody never asked.
And that's what she's doing.

21:47.785 --> 21:50.385
Not everybody wants credit
for their good deeds.

21:50.462 --> 21:53.362
I'm dying to know who's behind this.
- Yeah, so am I.

21:54.076 --> 21:58.476
And this is the opportunity I've been searching
for. If I can't deliver, it's back to coffee brew land.

21:59.561 --> 22:03.661
Look, I know that this is your big break.
I just don't agree with your approach.

22:03.745 --> 22:07.245
She's an undercover reporter trying to crack
a story with a positive spin.

22:08.044 --> 22:12.044
This is a win!
Hope, you're gonna knock this right off the pock.

22:15.431 --> 22:18.631
So, where is the red string?
- I was fresh out.

22:19.226 --> 22:22.026
None of these people know eachother?
- Right.

22:22.109 --> 22:24.209
What do the numbers next to their names mean?

22:24.651 --> 22:28.951
Well, recipient 1 refers to the guy who
found the first jar that I'm aware of.

22:28.965 --> 22:31.165
All the way down to me,
number 51.

22:32.226 --> 22:35.726
Who's this guy? I'd like to interview
him. You know what I mean? Number 7...

22:35.783 --> 22:38.583
Come on down!
- Brandi! Focus.

22:40.199 --> 22:42.999
Numbers 23 to 51 have all been
in the last four years,...

22:43.072 --> 22:46.572
indicating that there's I think more than
one person who's responsible for the gifts.

22:46.742 --> 22:50.742
I thought if I laid it out like this,
it would start to make more sense...

22:50.761 --> 22:54.161
and see closer patterns,
but it's still not any clearer.

22:56.332 --> 22:59.632
Look, you're all the way out of the outskirts.
Here...

23:01.468 --> 23:03.268
Where do you come from?

23:04.412 --> 23:10.412
The last 32 jars are all in the rural areas,
but jars 1 to 18 are all in tyhe inner city.

23:11.748 --> 23:17.248
So, whoever gave up the early jars was likely
the same person, living in that neighbourhood.

23:17.313 --> 23:22.013
Precisely. These others jars
could be the work of copycat offenders.

23:22.044 --> 23:24.144
I mean, assailants ... uh ...

23:26.707 --> 23:29.207
Thanks, Steve.
- Mr. Investigator.

23:32.417 --> 23:36.917
Well, I always knew there was a reason
I went DC over Marvel. Detective Comics.

23:40.759 --> 23:44.759
That was my bad. Uhm...
I thought that the breaks were on...

23:47.012 --> 23:50.012
Let's go for lunch.
- I got this! Don't worry about a thing.

23:52.834 --> 23:56.934
When I first came to the US,
I was excited but nervous

23:57.631 --> 24:01.131
My English wasn't very good
and it was hard for me to make friends.

24:01.322 --> 24:04.722
So I didn't fit in and, ohh,
Christmas time was the worst.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.153
How so?

24:07.897 --> 24:10.997
Well, what people don't realize is that Holiday
celebrations ...

24:11.098 --> 24:14.898
are only fun for the people that get
invited to them.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.040
Every day I would just go to work and
come home. I felt like nobody saw me.

24:19.133 --> 24:22.333
Except for those kids.
- Children have a way of seeing things.

24:23.561 --> 24:28.161
Especially when they stole my laptop.
And my bike and the wreath on my door.

24:28.665 --> 24:31.665
And stuffed a rotting pumpkin
down my mailbox.

24:31.834 --> 24:34.434
At least I think it was a pumpkin.
- Iew.

24:34.463 --> 24:36.363
I can't eat any of ....

24:39.127 --> 24:44.327
Right when I was at my lowest point, when I was
wondering if this country was ever going to feel like home...

24:46.974 --> 24:49.174
I found this jar at my door.

24:50.097 --> 24:55.197
It confused me at first, but there was a red ribbon
tied all around it...

24:55.392 --> 24:57.792
and the word Christmas Jar was on the glass.

24:58.732 --> 25:03.532
So I understood it was a gift. Someone
actually wanted to do something nice for me.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.079
That changed everything.

25:07.595 --> 25:10.995
I don't suppose you ever found out
who gave you the jar?

25:11.094 --> 25:12.594
I don't know who he is.

25:13.261 --> 25:18.761
But my security system caught the man on video.
- Please tell me you still have the video?

25:20.894 --> 25:23.094
I think I can find it.

25:28.215 --> 25:29.215
Who are you?

25:34.036 --> 25:36.236
Hope, Dopey!
How is our story coming?

25:36.309 --> 25:38.009
It's great!
Everything is great.

25:38.031 --> 25:39.031
Don't slow her down.

25:39.755 --> 25:40.855
Don't mess it up.

25:40.878 --> 25:44.978
This is exactly the kind of story I wanna run this year,
so I'm really looking forward to reading it.

25:45.623 --> 25:46.623
Thanks, Lyle.

25:56.853 --> 25:58.753
How the hell am I gonna figure out
who this guy is?

25:59.434 --> 26:03.734
Come on, girl. You're an investigative reporter now.
You've got to think like a cop.

26:04.865 --> 26:07.265
Act like a cop. Move like a cop.

26:10.930 --> 26:13.330
You're brilliant.
- I know.

26:14.898 --> 26:17.598
It's a '74 MG.
You can make out the license plate.

26:17.655 --> 26:20.755
But that can't be done if  it's
not registered in the state.

26:23.052 --> 26:27.452
You know, I offered to fix your lock,
not help you stalk some poor guy.

26:27.482 --> 26:30.982
You know I'm not really stalking him.
It's for my article.

26:31.829 --> 26:34.229
I made you think Christmas brings out
the worst in people.

26:34.387 --> 26:39.087
But look at this guy. He gives away jars full of change
to perfect strangers down on their luck.

26:39.087 --> 26:41.287
And I want to write about him.

26:41.775 --> 26:46.975
Come on. It's a compelling story with a hopeful
message. The world needs more of this right now.

26:51.149 --> 26:53.249
What exactly do you need from me?

26:53.883 --> 26:56.883
There are only three people in Ohio
with this make and model of this car.

26:57.041 --> 27:01.241
A 78 year old woman who lives in Akron,
a 53 year old man who lives in Dayton,...

27:01.317 --> 27:03.517
and a 24 year old guy who lives here in Columbus.

27:03.972 --> 27:09.272
He's our guy. Ian Maxwell, six foot one,
light brown hair, brown eyes and no priors.

27:09.355 --> 27:10.955
Scorpio?
- Libra.

27:11.378 --> 27:14.678
Officer Webber wouldn't tell me anything else,
So I had to do my own digging.

27:14.705 --> 27:16.705
Love made it cyber stalking ...

27:17.277 --> 27:21.777
He graduated three years ago from Ohio State
and now he works for his family's ...

27:21.865 --> 27:23.665
furniture restoration business, which they
run out of their home.

27:23.713 --> 27:27.113
So you have their home address?
- Yeah. And guess where he lives?

27:32.540 --> 27:33.940
Right here.
In the middle of everyone.

27:33.967 --> 27:35.267
No way!
- Yeah.

27:35.737 --> 27:41.137
Problem is, I can't just show up at his door
and be like "hey, I'm the

27:41.309 --> 27:44.509
Why not? Sometimes when you meet a new guy
you've got to pretend ...

27:44.546 --> 27:46.846
that you're into the same
super stuff that he's into.

27:46.889 --> 27:49.789
Brandi, that's really bad advice.
- Hear me out.

27:49.974 --> 27:54.474
Show up with an old piece of furniture, you
talk about your mutual love for sand paper and polish...

27:54.545 --> 27:57.245
and whatever he does, and then
boom, done, you're in.

28:02.799 --> 28:06.399
What about this?
- I've already got one of those.

28:07.399 --> 28:10.399
No you don't! I'm getting it.
- For what?

28:11.665 --> 28:14.065
Masquerade Monday!
- That's a non-thing.

28:15.086 --> 28:16.086
Not yet.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.700
This is what I've been looking for.

28:28.798 --> 28:31.798
I can't believe they still want
75 bucks for this thing!

28:33.290 --> 28:34.690
It's perfect.

28:34.893 --> 28:36.593
I think it's old.

28:39.849 --> 28:43.849
Would you take 50 bucks for
this old broken desk?

28:46.163 --> 28:51.563
Well, this a gorgeous antique mahogany ladies writing
desk with green leather inset from the regents here.

28:53.578 --> 28:54.578
So 50 bucks?

28:56.122 --> 28:57.522
You've got it.
- Yes!

28:58.793 --> 29:00.793
Is there anything else you can tell
me about it?

29:00.892 --> 29:03.592
There's a locked drawer
and no key, unfortunately.

29:04.752 --> 29:06.452
And what about other damage?

29:07.726 --> 29:10.926
O, ladies... What do you think
 you're gonna look like in 200 years?

29:11.567 --> 29:12.567
True.

29:53.352 --> 29:54.352
Hi, there!

29:55.361 --> 29:57.161
You must be Hope.
- I am.

29:57.425 --> 30:00.925
I'm Adam ans this is my daughter Hannah.
Let me give you a hand.

30:02.353 --> 30:07.653
Okay.
- Hoooh! My hand!

30:07.675 --> 30:10.175
Just kidding!

30:11.597 --> 30:13.297
You've got it?
There we go.

30:15.530 --> 30:16.597
Watch the legs, there.

30:20.195 --> 30:22.895
What did this poor desk do
to deserve this?

30:23.054 --> 30:27.154
It was my grandmother's.
I'm afraid it's been a little affected.

30:28.062 --> 30:29.962
Where did your grandmother get it from?

30:32.114 --> 30:35.114
O, eh ... it was a wedding gift
from her father.

30:38.118 --> 30:41.118
He didn't want her to stop writing
just because she got married.

30:41.203 --> 30:43.303
Wow, what did she write?
- Wat did she write...

30:49.353 --> 30:53.053
Uhm.... You know, letters, poems,
short stories and that sort of things.

30:58.003 --> 31:01.003
How romantic.
- Okay, let's gat her in there.

31:02.046 --> 31:03.646
I got it.
- Thank you. Okay.

31:15.631 --> 31:17.331
Hope, make yourself at home, okay?

31:17.347 --> 31:21.547
Alright, careful where you step.
Dad's always leaving sharp pieces of wood...

31:22.018 --> 31:24.218
and hazardous materials kicking around.

31:24.397 --> 31:29.797
Hey, that's part of the artistic process.
- That's what you're calling it now. You're just messy.

31:31.245 --> 31:35.545
Two hats hanging on a hat rack.
One said: You stay here, I'll go on ahead.

31:36.356 --> 31:38.656
O, don't encourage his bad jokes.

31:39.656 --> 31:41.556
You love them.
- Nope.

31:42.038 --> 31:44.238
So, how many of you are
in the family business?

31:44.297 --> 31:48.697
O, technically it's just me, my dad and my brother.
But really everybody lends a hand.

31:48.725 --> 31:51.425
It looks like you have a lot of
other jobs on the go.

31:51.475 --> 31:55.275
Yeah, but that's normal for us.
- In fact, I've sort of a strange favour to ask.

31:57.762 --> 32:01.762
I'm a journalism major at Ohio State,
and for my business writing class...

32:01.831 --> 32:05.131
I have to write a report about a
local family home business.

32:06.086 --> 32:09.686
I was wondering if you would let me
write about Maxwell Restoration.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.919
Well, I don't know,
we like to keep a low profile.

32:11.943 --> 32:14.043
O, come on.
It might to good for publicity.

32:15.433 --> 32:20.933
Everyone else is writing about a family
home restaurant, or a funeral home.

32:21.796 --> 32:24.696
And this would be just way more
interesting than all of those.

32:24.791 --> 32:28.791
I don't know. A funeral home sounds
pretty interesting and spooky....

32:30.331 --> 32:33.331
I promise I would stay out of your way.

32:35.103 --> 32:39.503
Okay, my little elves. Who's ready to put down
their mallets and take a break from the workshop?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.420
Hope, this is my wife, Lauren.
Lauren, Hope.

32:43.419 --> 32:46.119
Hope dropped off this beautiful
mahogany desk...

32:46.120 --> 32:49.620
and she's gonna write something about
our business for a school assignment.

32:49.633 --> 32:51.733
What do you think?
- It's exciting!

32:52.257 --> 32:54.157
Hope, would you like to join us for lunch?

32:55.282 --> 32:57.882
O, no, no. I couldn't possibly ...

33:00.851 --> 33:04.651
What is that delicious smell?
- Come on. Find out.

33:07.396 --> 33:12.196
So, Hope, you said you were in your senior year.
What are your plans after you graduate. You have any?

33:13.238 --> 33:17.638
Well, I've always wanted to be a journalist.
- Alison is gonna love you.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.197
Who's Alison?
- My little sister.

33:20.265 --> 33:23.265
She writes all these stories,
but she never shares it with us.

33:23.382 --> 33:27.282
I used to be like that. Sharing your writlings
is like giving someone a peek in your soul.

33:27.417 --> 33:28.417
That's never easy.

33:29.186 --> 33:32.386
Well, you can tell you're a writer.
I could never put words together like that.

33:32.402 --> 33:37.902
Or sentences, or coherent thoughts.
- O, look who it is. Just in time for a free lunch like always.

33:38.881 --> 33:40.381
As a matter of fact I already ate, ...

33:40.440 --> 33:43.540
but you go ahead and enjoy the
green thing stuck in your teeth.

33:43.569 --> 33:47.769
Ian, this is Hope, and she's going to write
a profile on Maxwell Restorations...

33:48.289 --> 33:50.489
for her business writing class.

33:50.513 --> 33:54.313
Really! You couldn't find a more interesting
company to write about?

33:54.353 --> 33:57.553
He's just jealous, because we get all the
thank you's and he gets all the bills.

33:57.639 --> 33:59.639
Somebody has to take care
of that book keeping debacle.

33:59.735 --> 34:02.635
I overpayed a supplier once.
- By 2,000 dollars!

34:02.671 --> 34:04.171
I'm a giving guy!

34:04.248 --> 34:07.948
Mom, I said I already ate.
- It's a small bowl of soup.

34:08.027 --> 34:10.428
Hope, here's the tip: if my mom
asks if you're hungry,...

34:10.813 --> 34:13.213
you might as well say yes, because
she's gonna feed you anyway.

34:13.273 --> 34:14.873
Always arrive with an appetite.

34:15.978 --> 34:17.478
That actually sounds really nice.

34:18.505 --> 34:20.304
Okay, you're ready?
- For what?

34:20.362 --> 34:21.962
Come on, you know.
Come on!

34:22.409 --> 34:24.109
Oh boy.
- Alright, here we go. One, two, three.

34:31.472 --> 34:32.972
CHRISTMAS JAR.

34:43.195 --> 34:45.195
So .... what's Ian like?

34:46.574 --> 34:48.675
He seems nice. They all do.

34:49.246 --> 34:51.746
Is he cute?
- I'm trying to work.

34:52.475 --> 34:56.475
You do think he's cute.
- No! I ... What if I do?

34:57.143 --> 35:00.543
And that doesn't change the fact
that I'm there on assignment.

35:01.854 --> 35:07.054
And I'm still here ordering punch and
costumes for the office party, all by myself.

35:09.050 --> 35:10.050
Sorry.

35:13.396 --> 35:16.496
What's with the mistletoe?
- Carry it with you at all times.

35:16.645 --> 35:18.145
Works like a charm.

35:19.294 --> 35:20.494
Good luck.

35:33.903 --> 35:36.903
It's an antique ladies writing desk
from the Regency era.

35:37.005 --> 35:38.005
Exactly.

35:38.099 --> 35:40.899
It's the kind of desk you can imagine
Jane Austen probably used to sit at...

35:40.948 --> 35:43.448
to write her novels.
- You read Jane Austen?

35:43.503 --> 35:46.003
O, no, no.
I just know the time period.

35:46.997 --> 35:51.297
Don't lie. Ian loves sappy love stories.
- I do not!

35:51.332 --> 35:55.232
Everybody likes a good love story.
My son is a romantic.

35:55.599 --> 35:58.299
It's amazing that he is still single.

35:58.616 --> 36:02.116
What about you, Hope?
Are you single?

36:02.182 --> 36:03.382
Dad!
- What?

36:04.502 --> 36:06.202
Uh, yeah.
- Really?

36:06.289 --> 36:10.389
I would have thought that guys would be
lining up around the block to go uot with you.

36:10.399 --> 36:11.899
Dad!
- What?

36:14.275 --> 36:18.075
You know you should give Ian your phone number.
- Hey, that's enough.

36:20.283 --> 36:24.483
You know, it's just in case I mean ... uh,
an interesting piece comes in and you're not here!

36:24.908 --> 36:26.408
Right.
- Okay.

36:27.895 --> 36:28.895
Thanks, dad.

36:38.015 --> 36:42.315
This piece is stunnig.
- You know, each piece has a story to tell.

36:42.538 --> 36:46.038
Our job is to see to it that their stories carry on.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.680
Do you mind if I record a few questions?
- Yeah, okay.

36:50.687 --> 36:54.687
So how do you deviate the workload?
- Well, that's kind of all over the place.

36:54.740 --> 36:58.740
There's no real order.
Used to be that Hannah was my apprentice.

36:59.321 --> 37:02.521
I've been teaching her everything I know
since she was 8 years old.

37:03.139 --> 37:05.139
Learned a lot that day.

37:06.151 --> 37:08.351
These days, I'm the one learning from her.

37:10.723 --> 37:15.723
How did this all get started?
- That was when I was in college.

37:17.034 --> 37:20.734
I needed to make a little extra money
and so I started this business...

37:20.939 --> 37:23.439
weel, 36 years later I was still at it.

37:23.618 --> 37:27.518
And frankly, it's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

37:28.016 --> 37:31.416
What would you say is your company's purpose?
Your mission statement?

37:31.678 --> 37:35.178
O, that's easy. We make damaged
furniture beautiful again.

37:38.907 --> 37:40.507
Clear and simple.
- It sure is.

37:40.517 --> 37:44.517
You can fix just about anything if
you apply enough love and elbow grease.

37:46.867 --> 37:49.867
Mom, I'm thirsty.
- Are you thirsty? I'm grandpa.

37:50.503 --> 37:53.303
Ask your grandma to give you a drink.
- I can't find her.

37:53.331 --> 37:57.131
Honey, my hands are all covered in stain.
- I can get it for him.

37:57.572 --> 38:00.572
Thanks, Hope. Ther's a new bottle
of apple juice in the fridge.

38:03.220 --> 38:05.220
So, how old are you Jake?
- Six.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.280
Six? Are you driving yet?
- Nope.

38:08.913 --> 38:12.213
Do you have a girlfrind?
- Nope. Do you have a boyfriend?

38:12.291 --> 38:14.791
No.
Where'are the cups?

38:16.614 --> 38:18.814
Just over there.
- Thank you.

38:24.475 --> 38:26.875
So you must be excited about Christmas?
- I do.

38:26.966 --> 38:30.466
Yeah, me too.
Hey, can you tell me what that jar is?

38:32.014 --> 38:33.914
O, it's the Christmas jar.

38:34.009 --> 38:37.509
The Christmas jar. What's that?
- Not supposed to say.

38:38.445 --> 38:39.445
How come?

38:43.716 --> 38:46.116
So, what are you gonna ask Santa for Christmas?

38:46.476 --> 38:48.676
My Sammy.
- Who's Sammy?

38:49.417 --> 38:51.917
He's lost.
- O, no.

38:54.859 --> 38:57.459
Could I go on playing now?
- Sure.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.380
It can use some over there.

39:02.303 --> 39:04.303
Thanks, Hope.
- He's adorable.

39:04.916 --> 39:05.916
Who's Sammy?

39:07.743 --> 39:10.443
He said the only thing he wants
for Christmas is Sammy.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.722
Who's that?
- That was his teddybear.

39:13.116 --> 39:17.416
They were inseparable. But then we lost him
last summer from visiting my inlaws.

39:17.622 --> 39:22.322
We've been looking everywhere for a replacement,
but Sammy was a gift of Jake when he was born...

39:22.349 --> 39:24.249
and no one seems to be
making them anymore.

39:24.321 --> 39:26.321
He has been heartbroken ever since.
- Poor little guy.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.798
Ian just found out about a another job.

39:29.143 --> 39:33.543
You should probably go with him to see
how the other side of our business works.

39:33.564 --> 39:36.564
I will just be loading a piece of
old furniture in my truck, dad.

39:36.661 --> 39:40.161
Exactly, all part of the process.
She should see everything.

39:42.315 --> 39:46.015
I do't have to go
- No, no. It's fine. I'd love for you to write about me.

39:46.018 --> 39:51.018
Not, not, ... eh ... about me, but
... ehh  ... I mean, like the family.

39:52.549 --> 39:54.049
Yeah, let's go.
- O, okay.

39:54.145 --> 39:58.045
Take your time, guys!
- Can you be any more obvious?

39:58.804 --> 40:01.504
What?
- I see what you're doing.

40:02.779 --> 40:04.279
Get back to work.

40:18.722 --> 40:22.022
You've asked us so many questions. What we
hardly know anything about you.

40:22.113 --> 40:24.813
O, that's because I'm not writing a report
about me.

40:24.824 --> 40:28.624
But what if you were, what would you
say is the most interesting thing about you?

40:28.656 --> 40:32.656
Whatever happened to where to go out
or your favourite colour?

40:32.657 --> 40:38.557
No one outside you and my family knows about
my love for classic English literature...

40:38.604 --> 40:40.804
Romance!
- Literature.

40:42.949 --> 40:45.149
Literature!
- It's romance.

40:46.923 --> 40:49.823
I'll have you know that I'm also
a huge fan of Ellis Bell.

40:49.873 --> 40:53.873
Well you know that Ellis Bell was the
preudonym used by Emily Brontë?

40:54.974 --> 40:56.274
Seriously?
- Yeah.

40:58.022 --> 40:59.422
I knew that.
- Okay.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.193
Okay, let me think.

41:04.988 --> 41:09.188
I cry all the time watching movies.
I have an irrational fear of clowns.

41:09.950 --> 41:11.250
Who doesn't?

41:12.297 --> 41:17.797
And on Christmas eve, when I was 3 days old,
I was abandoned in a booth in a roadside diner.

41:18.359 --> 41:23.859
The woman who found me,
she became my adoptive mother

41:26.082 --> 41:30.582
And she was single, with hardly
any money or family support.

41:32.449 --> 41:36.249
But she still managed to do an amazing job raising me.

41:38.081 --> 41:39.881
And we were extremely close.

41:41.860 --> 41:42.860
Where is she now?

41:45.359 --> 41:50.359
She recently passed away.
- O, I'm so sorry.

41:54.154 --> 41:55.954
It's been a really tough time.

42:08.548 --> 42:10.248
Hey, Hope?
- Yeah?

42:13.589 --> 42:14.889
What's your favourite colour?

42:19.712 --> 42:22.812
I told you...
Alright, thank you.

42:33.580 --> 42:36.280
Jake, what did one snowman say
to the other snowman?

42:36.340 --> 42:41.340
Do you smell carrots?
- Jake, isn't that the worst joke ever?

42:41.748 --> 42:45.348
Did you get that from him?
- No. no. Mine are good.

42:48.798 --> 42:51.598
So, how do customers find you?
- Usually through the mouth.

42:51.699 --> 42:56.699
Really? 'Cause if you advertise on City Buzz,
there is an average of 40,000 visitors a day.

42:58.392 --> 43:02.492
It will yield 6 to 10 thousand
onclicks a month,...

43:03.222 --> 43:05.422
and it's not even that expensive.

43:11.846 --> 43:14.846
I did an internship there last summer.

43:18.201 --> 43:20.401
We do go through some slow patches.

43:21.945 --> 43:24.045
Something to think about maybe?
- Okay.

43:24.531 --> 43:27.131
Is it true you were born in a diner?
- Jake!

43:32.777 --> 43:33.977
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

43:34.059 --> 43:38.559
No ... I wasn't born in an diner,
Jake.

43:38.654 --> 43:42.554
But my mom dropped me off there,
when I was just al ittle baby.

43:42.609 --> 43:45.809
Did you ever find out who your
birth mother was?

43:45.856 --> 43:49.756
No, I've always been wondering what
could have been going on in het life...

43:49.865 --> 43:53.765
that was so awful, so abandoning me
seemed like a better option.

43:54.050 --> 43:57.050
Do you want to find her?
- I don't know.

43:58.068 --> 44:02.468
Every Christmas eve my mom and I would
sit in that booth at Chuck's, have a big dinner...

44:02.530 --> 44:05.030
to celebrate the day she found me.

44:05.146 --> 44:09.046
I always secretly wondered if maybe my
birth mom would show up too.

44:10.809 --> 44:13.209
Did she ever come back?
- I don't think so.

44:14.556 --> 44:18.956
Every time the door would open with a jingle,
I would search all the faces and ....

44:19.238 --> 44:23.938
see if anyone was looking for me. After all these
years I've stopped searching.

44:26.950 --> 44:31.250
I'm so sorry.
- Don't be. I had the best mom I could have asked for.

44:32.264 --> 44:37.264
What about you grandmother, is she still alive?
Your grandmother, the writer?

44:39.762 --> 44:41.662
The one that gave you the desk.

44:48.873 --> 44:51.473
Why don't we give Hope a break.
- Good idea.

44:51.511 --> 44:54.511
Who's ready for desert?
- O, I don't know.

45:14.939 --> 45:18.039
I've got cake. Who wants cake?
- This is a great photo.

45:18.127 --> 45:20.427
How did you two meet?

45:20.536 --> 45:24.636
Well, when I was seventeen, Lauren and the family
moved down the street from us.

45:26.270 --> 45:30.170
Prettiest girl in the neighbourhood.
I used to see her waiting for the bus ...

45:30.708 --> 45:35.008
or walking the dog, but I could never
muster the courage to say hi to her.

45:35.446 --> 45:39.246
And then when one day my dog got away from me,
when she took off after a squirrel, ...

45:39.787 --> 45:42.087
and Adam helped me get her back.
- Yeah.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.265
How did you know he was the one?

45:44.938 --> 45:47.438
I just knew.
Or at least my heart knew.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.580
You make me cry.
- I know!

45:55.878 --> 46:00.478
So I was getting Jake a drink and he called
that jar on your shelf a Christmas jar.

46:02.882 --> 46:04.382
What's that all about?

46:12.545 --> 46:15.845
It's just the place where we
throw in change. That's all.

46:16.761 --> 46:20.161
O, come on, dad. Tell the story.
- What story?

46:26.680 --> 46:31.080
Okay. Lauren and I were
in our twenties, newly married, ...

46:31.127 --> 46:34.227
and completely broke. And Christmas was just
around the corner.

46:35.056 --> 46:38.889
And I wanted to buy something
for my new beloved bride.

46:38.945 --> 46:43.845
So that november we had this idea to throw
whatever change we had in a jar ...

46:44.280 --> 46:48.680
and see what we could save up.
- So I washed out an empty raspberry jam container ...

46:49.583 --> 46:52.883
and wrote the words Christmas jar across the glass.

46:52.994 --> 46:57.094
Yeah, and we put hte jar right in the middle
of the table, so we could see it all the time.

46:57.179 --> 47:00.179
And what, by Christmas we saved 28 bucks.
- Which didn't go far.

47:00.273 --> 47:03.173
No, we didn't.
- But it was something.

47:04.251 --> 47:07.651
So, the next year we started earlier. Like
Halloween or something.

47:07.661 --> 47:10.561
No, it was like May.
- No, I think it was Halloween.

47:10.620 --> 47:14.920
It was ... late May.
I got this bigger jar, and we promised ourselves ...

47:14.973 --> 47:18.173
that we would never get into it
for no reason whatsoever.

47:18.256 --> 47:22.256
Then of course, the kids came along,
and we started even earlier.

47:22.747 --> 47:24.947
We wanted to buy gifts for everyone.

47:25.040 --> 47:32.840
Until Hannah had other ideas.
It was 22 years ago, Christmas eve, ...

47:33.564 --> 47:36.564
and we took the jar to the bank
as we always did every year, ...

47:36.707 --> 47:38.807
before we did our shopping.

47:39.979 --> 47:43.679
Okay, who's ready to put all this change
in the big coin machine?

47:44.258 --> 47:47.258
Meeee!
- Are you ready? Right over here.

47:47.298 --> 47:49.898
I know how much it is.
- How much is in there?

47:50.650 --> 47:54.650
874 Dollars and 90 cents.
- Are you sure?

47:55.196 --> 47:58.196
Yeah!
- Okay, I think you're probably right.

47:58.668 --> 48:02.668
Hold on. I will get your baby brother.
Here we go. I got you.

48:10.580 --> 48:13.780
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

48:15.220 --> 48:20.220
Why are you so sad?
Why are you wearing sunglasses in the wintertime?

48:31.880 --> 48:36.280
Would you like our Christmas jar?
- No, thank you, I couldn't.

48:37.104 --> 48:40.704
Hannah? Don't wander off like that.
You scared the heck out of us.

48:41.083 --> 48:44.483
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. But this lady isn't.

48:49.286 --> 48:53.086
I asked her if she wanted our Christmas jar.
- She's very sweet.

48:55.710 --> 48:58.710
Tell you what?
Why don't you go give it to her?

49:00.124 --> 49:04.624
O, no, I couldn't.
- Yes you can.

49:05.226 --> 49:08.226
Really?
- We really want you to have it.

49:11.872 --> 49:14.272
Give it to her.
That's it, honey.

49:16.158 --> 49:17.858
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49:20.923 --> 49:23.423
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

49:34.606 --> 49:37.006
When we gave away the jar that day, ...

49:37.127 --> 49:39.027
we gave away our Christmas.

49:39.785 --> 49:42.985
There wasn't any money there
to buy gifts for anyone.

49:46.137 --> 49:48.837
And then in the morning,
with no presents to open, ...

49:48.916 --> 49:52.416
we turned on the christmas lights,
put on some carols, ...

49:53.113 --> 49:56.513
and took turn sharing what
we were all grateful for.

49:57.989 --> 50:00.589
It turned out to be the best Christmas
we ever had.

50:01.073 --> 50:03.273
And we vowed to do it every year after that.

50:03.364 --> 50:08.364
So from that point on we threw
all our change into a jar, year around, ....

50:08.374 --> 50:12.674
and then we would give it to someone
we thought could really use it.

50:16.442 --> 50:19.442
And you're the first person
who we've ever told that to.

50:19.468 --> 50:23.968
So, I guess that makes you one of us now.
- Yeah. Mom's the worst...

50:35.170 --> 50:39.170
Still have to repair the corners on this night table
and we have to strip that desk of yours.

50:39.219 --> 50:42.119
Some locker thinner,
then give it a good sanding.

50:42.326 --> 50:44.626
Do you have any questions
about any of this?

50:44.716 --> 50:48.916
Yeah, I'd like to know how you decide
on the person to give yours jars to.

50:48.959 --> 50:51.359
So were back to that, are we?

50:51.478 --> 50:54.478
Sorry. I couldn't stop thinking
about it last night.

50:54.784 --> 50:59.884
We share stories we've overheard about people
from work, school, church, whereever.

50:59.884 --> 51:03.184
Do you ever wonder about them?
I mean, where they are now?

51:03.256 --> 51:08.056
Sure. I think about them year round,
every time I throw my spare change in the jar.

51:08.695 --> 51:11.395
And no one's ever guessed
the jars came from you?

51:11.421 --> 51:13.721
Come on, there's still work to be done.

51:13.742 --> 51:17.142
Sorry.
- Don't be sorry, just give me a hand with this clamp here.

51:24.686 --> 51:27.586
You haven't learned anything, have you?
- Not a thing.

51:30.213 --> 51:32.913
Hey Hope, I finally got your drawer unlocked.

51:35.233 --> 51:38.733
Maybe we'll find one of
your grandmothers old stories...

51:39.749 --> 51:44.849
Actually, that's been locked for so long,
probably even before my grandmother had it.

51:44.871 --> 51:45.871
I don't know ...

51:58.267 --> 52:00.067
That's an old Chinese take-out menu.

52:01.058 --> 52:05.258
That wasn't what you were expecting, huh?
- Honestly I had no idea what would be in there.

52:05.296 --> 52:06.796
Hey, what's up guys?

52:06.843 --> 52:10.143
We want to know if Hope will come
skating with us tomorrow.

52:10.503 --> 52:13.603
I promised I'd take him in the morning.
You're welcome to join us, if you like.

52:13.614 --> 52:16.414
Yeah, I'd love to.
- Yeah, she's coming!

52:16.743 --> 52:20.443
We usually go for pancakes afterwards.
- I know the perfect place.

52:28.701 --> 52:30.201
Hey Hope!

52:32.357 --> 52:35.257
So, did you always know
you were gonna be a reporter?

52:36.362 --> 52:39.362
Yeah, I can't imagine
doing anything else.

52:40.261 --> 52:42.261
I don't know what kind of writer
I want to be.

52:42.358 --> 52:44.358
Well, you have a lot of time
to figure that out.

52:44.384 --> 52:46.384
Right now I just like making up
my own stories.

52:46.427 --> 52:48.627
Maybe I can read one someday?

52:48.831 --> 52:52.031
I know it can be scary.
I promise I won't be mean.

52:52.048 --> 52:53.848
I know. I trust you.

52:56.339 --> 52:58.839
Tap! You're it!
- I'm gonna get you!

52:59.751 --> 53:01.151
You seem to be knowing what
you're doing out here?

53:01.171 --> 53:03.471
Sure.
I've been skating since I was five.

53:03.690 --> 53:06.690
You know any tricks?
- Yeah, I used to.

53:07.496 --> 53:10.696
Let's see what you've got.
- Okay, it's been a while.

53:10.853 --> 53:13.153
Don't laugh if I fall.
- No promises.

53:42.204 --> 53:46.504
Are you okay?
- Uh, no. I think I just broke my dignity.

53:57.836 --> 54:01.836
Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I was just thinking about my mom.

54:03.161 --> 54:05.861
This is the same place
she taught me how to skate.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.440
Sorry, I didn't know.
- It's okay.

54:09.132 --> 54:10.132
I just miss her.

54:29.672 --> 54:34.172
You know when your tears are cold,
those can be sharp and deadly.

54:48.996 --> 54:52.763
Can I aks you a question about those jars?
- So what are your plans for the holidays?

54:53.725 --> 54:54.725
You go first.

54:55.529 --> 54:59.529
I was just wondering why you always
give the jars away anonymously.

55:01.203 --> 55:04.203
That way no one thinks
they owe us anything in return.

55:04.242 --> 55:06.042
That's the real spirit of giving.

55:06.325 --> 55:10.325
Has anyone ever caught you in the act?
- Almost.

55:11.871 --> 55:15.204
A couple of years ago a woman whom I was
supposed to give a jar to, opened the door ...

55:15.279 --> 55:19.079
right as I was about to put it down.
And so I pretended I was lost ...

55:20.823 --> 55:22.823
and asked her for directions.
- O, no!

55:22.894 --> 55:26.394
Yeah, in the age of GPS
I was asking for directions.

55:28.214 --> 55:32.014
She must have thought
I was casing her house for a break-in

55:32.063 --> 55:34.563
So, after that I started delivering
them in the middel of the night.

55:34.718 --> 55:36.418
So no one would see me.

55:38.551 --> 55:40.351
So what were you gonna ask me?

55:41.180 --> 55:44.280
I was wondering if you had any plans
for the holidays.

55:45.445 --> 55:49.745
No.
- Maybe we could go out to dinner, or something?

55:51.716 --> 55:53.716
Dinner would be good, yeah.

56:06.309 --> 56:09.309
You seem happy.
- We've been having such a fun day.

56:09.896 --> 56:12.896
Still haven't told them yet?
- I promise I'm gonna tell them everything ...

56:12.981 --> 56:13.981
when the time is right.

56:14.324 --> 56:16.524
The longer you wait,
the harder it's gonna be.

56:16.576 --> 56:18.576
I know.
But I can't yet.

56:18.665 --> 56:22.665
You'll be fine, Hope.
If you write that story, you'll make us proud.

56:24.921 --> 56:29.121
Yes. This article is a chance for the people
whose lives we've changed, ...

56:29.703 --> 56:31.003
to say thank you.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.080
If you say so.

56:32.227 --> 56:35.227
I just hate seeing you compromise
your values.

56:35.249 --> 56:37.349
And I don't want to see you get hurt.

56:37.406 --> 56:42.506
O, Come on, Cynthia! It's not like she's pretending
to be a doctor, to perform a surgery or something.

56:43.812 --> 56:47.312
She's telling people she's a college student.
What's the big deal?

56:47.621 --> 56:50.721
I should really get back.
But come and say hi, okay?

56:57.640 --> 57:00.840
Hoi. We were just discussing your
incredible figure skating skills.

57:01.102 --> 57:04.602
O, yeah. Did you talk about when you fell on me?

57:05.320 --> 57:08.220
I don't remember that.
- I saw it.

57:08.485 --> 57:11.185
Thank you.
Hey, you see that seat over there? Right in the end?

57:12.032 --> 57:15.132
That's where I used to sit to finish my homework
every dat after school.

57:15.247 --> 57:18.147
And where I was waiting
for my mom to finish her shift.

57:18.203 --> 57:21.903
You had your own stool?
- Sure did. I practically grew up here.

57:22.793 --> 57:25.993
And is this the booth
where your mom found you?

57:26.081 --> 57:27.081
Yeah. Right where you're sitting, actually.

57:30.156 --> 57:33.956
I got so lucky. She wasn't even
supposed to be in in that day.

57:34.461 --> 57:36.961
In that case we all got lucky.

57:48.182 --> 57:51.249
Important question: Do you believe pineapple
is ever an acceptable topping on a pizza?

57:53.819 --> 57:56.619
Too controversial an issue for
text message. Discuss over pizza?

57:58.593 --> 57:59.593
Great idea!

57:59.656 --> 58:02.856
Messing around with your phone, I see.
You must be done with your article?

58:02.870 --> 58:05.670
Not quite.
- What seems to be the problem, Hope?

58:05.733 --> 58:10.833
You've been saying 'not quite' for days.
- Well, I haven't been exactly honest with the Maxwells

58:11.567 --> 58:14.467
And I'm starting to feel
really guilty about it.

58:15.332 --> 58:16.832
Seriously?
- Yeah.

58:17.664 --> 58:22.064
Have you ever of Nellie Bly?
- No.

58:22.190 --> 58:27.823
Nellie pretended to be a crazy person
to get admitted to a mental hospital ...

58:28.014 --> 58:30.714
where she reported on the horrible
conditions inside.

58:30.722 --> 58:36.022
And that report became the foundation
for sweeping reforms in the psychiatric profession.

58:36.747 --> 58:41.847
Hope, there is a long history of journalists
in this country going undercover ...

58:42.029 --> 58:43.929
for the sake of a good story.

58:43.978 --> 58:46.978
And this what you've got right here,
is a good story.

58:47.497 --> 58:49.230
I know that.
- Okay.

58:49.305 --> 58:54.805
So don't fight it, embrace it.
Be one with it. Be Nellie Bly.

58:55.963 --> 58:56.963
Alright?
- Okay.

58:57.001 --> 58:59.601
Okay, you've got to show me something,
Hope. Because I'm telling you ....

58:59.700 --> 59:02.000
this whole wishy washy thing
is not cutting it.

59:02.226 --> 59:05.826
I put a lot of faith in you, Hope.
Don't make me regret it.

59:06.898 --> 59:11.298
Something is coming on here, is that regret?
O, that's regret. Yeah, Hope, help me.

59:18.761 --> 59:20.161
Hey!
- Hi.

59:20.196 --> 59:24.396
Whoa! What's all this?
- So I did a bit of Christmas shopping.

59:24.730 --> 59:27.730
I've got this for Ian.
It's the Jane Austen collection.

59:27.749 --> 59:30.449
O, that is perfect.
- I couldn't resist.

59:34.132 --> 59:36.632
Sammy!
But how?

59:38.255 --> 59:39.755
Thank you so much.

59:41.025 --> 59:44.725
You have just made his Christmas.
Okay, I'm gonna go hide all this.

59:45.445 --> 59:47.112
Everyone is in the kitchen.

59:49.965 --> 59:51.965
Ready to go. Great.

59:54.608 --> 59:58.708
It smells so good in here.
These are incredible. So cool.

01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:04.547
We were just talking about Christmas and
wondered if you'd like to join us?

01:00:04.595 --> 01:00:06.095
On Christmas eve.
- Really?

01:00:06.192 --> 01:00:09.692
Unless you have other plans.
- Just dinner at Chuck's like I usually do.

01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:13.271
Come over after dinner and spend
Christmas day with us too.

01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:18.291
Christmas eve is my favourite.
All the Christmas lights and carols, ...

01:00:18.434 --> 01:00:24.034
we've got presents, drink eggnog, simply
just talking and eating way too many of these.

01:00:24.046 --> 01:00:28.046
That sounds just about perfect.
- But I should warn you.

01:00:28.703 --> 01:00:33.003
Jake here gets up super early and makes
a point of waking everyone.

01:00:34.445 --> 01:00:37.345
How early?
- Five AM. Six if we're lucky.

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:41.917
Well, the Christmas eve part sounds great.
- You just come over whenever you want.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.710
But don't show up looking all fancy.
We spend half the day in our pyjamas.

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:49.844
Do you mind grabbing those for me?
- Of course.

01:00:51.035 --> 01:00:55.335
I was thinking about your birth mother.
Do you have any clues about her at all?

01:00:55.951 --> 01:00:58.551
She left a note in my baby blanket.

01:00:58.576 --> 01:01:00.976
But she never signed it.
- Did you keep it?

01:01:01.023 --> 01:01:03.923
Of course. It's the only thing
I have from her.

01:01:04.689 --> 01:01:07.489
What about trying one of these
family tree DNA-kits?

01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:09.176
That might lead you to a blood relative.

01:01:09.205 --> 01:01:14.105
I don't know. I always worried that
talking about that would upset my mom.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:17.838
Of course.
I'd be happy to help if you ever want to try.

01:01:18.813 --> 01:01:19.813
Thank you.

01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:23.338
Nope. Nope.
No, I'm not gonna take one.

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:29.945
They're really good.
- I don't even see them.

01:01:30.804 --> 01:01:32.304
No, they're not even there.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:36.597
But, yes, they are, honey,  and
this girl needs her sugar.

01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:39.431
One cannot survive on one alone.

01:01:39.691 --> 01:01:41.391
One speaks truth.

01:01:42.803 --> 01:01:45.403
Where's my story?
- It's almost finished.

01:01:45.917 --> 01:01:49.217
O, almost! That's great, yeah!
Because there's a single Christmas coming up ...

01:01:49.242 --> 01:01:51.742
and it's kind of a hard deadline!
- I know.

01:01:51.807 --> 01:01:55.007
But there's still a few pieces of the story
that I haven't quite cracked yet.

01:01:55.032 --> 01:01:57.032
Okay. Then just give me whatever
you've got by end of day.

01:01:57.045 --> 01:01:58.445
What? Why?
- Because!

01:01:58.533 --> 01:02:00.633
We're running out of time!
You're making me nervous.

01:02:00.788 --> 01:02:03.688
You know what?
Until your work done, cookies go bye-bye.

01:02:04.493 --> 01:02:06.293
But Lyle, I'm not done yet.

01:02:11.073 --> 01:02:14.173
I said no to you last week. Yeah.
No. No.

01:02:16.896 --> 01:02:18.196
Lame.

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.350
You've got the saddest sad salad.
- I'm stressing out!

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:26.571
Lyle wants my story by the end of the day
and I still haven't told the Maxwells the truth.

01:02:26.572 --> 01:02:30.372
O, boy.
- I know. I don't want to let Lyle down either.

01:02:30.415 --> 01:02:33.715
So what are you going to do?
- I ... don't know, Rory.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:40.495
I was gonna say: you're torn because
all you ever wanted was to be a reporter ...

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:44.856
and now this is finally your chance.
But you don't want to loose the Maxwells either.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:50.997
But if you could only have one, which
one would hurt the most to loose?

01:02:51.041 --> 01:02:55.341
That's just it: I can't choose.
- You may not have a choice.

01:02:56.342 --> 01:02:59.142
And if you don't act soon, you
may loose both of them.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:24.346
I can't believe she walks all this way.
- Five days a week, seven miles each way.

01:03:24.353 --> 01:03:27.453
She has to leave the house at 5:30
to get to work on time.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.680
At least that should be enough to fix her car.

01:03:29.686 --> 01:03:32.186
With hopefully someone
to do it for Christmas.

01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:35.971
Okay. Now, her mom is attending
the kids during the day ...

01:03:35.985 --> 01:03:39.085
and they'll probably be home,
so we'll have to be really quick.

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:43.330
Grandma, there's someone at the door.
- What do we do?

01:03:44.383 --> 01:03:45.683
Here!
- Go.

01:03:48.268 --> 01:03:49.268
Run!

01:03:58.748 --> 01:04:01.348
That felt incredible!
Hannah?

01:04:03.152 --> 01:04:04.152
Hannah!

01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:10.465
Shhh! Let's get out of here.

01:04:13.579 --> 01:04:15.879
Thanks for sharing this with me.

01:04:15.911 --> 01:04:16.911
Come on.

01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:10.284
I'm good!

01:05:12.238 --> 01:05:13.738
Four strikes in a row!
- What?

01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:17.831
That's my girl.
- Can you believe it?

01:05:18.839 --> 01:05:21.339
How about you, Hope?
What's your secret talent?

01:05:22.137 --> 01:05:25.337
O, I'm a really fast typist.
Boring.

01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:30.761
Okay. I can pick up a pen with my toes
and sign my name.

01:05:31.983 --> 01:05:33.883
Why would you ever learn to do that?

01:05:33.977 --> 01:05:36.477
You've never been really a child.

01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:39.037
How about you, Ian?
- Me? Uh ...

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:43.367
I think you should do that trick.
- Yes!

01:05:43.465 --> 01:05:44.965
No.
- Come on, do it!

01:05:45.062 --> 01:05:47.662
I'm not doing that ... I'm not gonna ...
- Please!

01:05:47.685 --> 01:05:50.385
What trick?
- Alright, I'll do the trick.

01:05:55.123 --> 01:05:56.923
Are you gonna make that disappear?

01:05:57.531 --> 01:05:58.531
Watch very closely.

01:06:11.424 --> 01:06:13.324
Not bad, huh?
Thank you very much.

01:06:16.183 --> 01:06:20.283
And is this the part where you reach
behind my ear and you flop the coin?

01:06:20.328 --> 01:06:21.628
Kind of.

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:24.112
Kind of?

01:06:36.822 --> 01:06:39.722
What's that?
- It's a key. For your desk drawer.

01:06:40.599 --> 01:06:41.799
I've made it.

01:06:43.412 --> 01:06:44.712
You made it?

01:06:47.238 --> 01:06:49.938
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:06:51.773 --> 01:06:53.673
Dis you practice that?
- The trick?

01:06:55.582 --> 01:06:59.882
No, made it up. On the spot.
- No way that was the first time.

01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:02.821
Hey, we're gonna get going if
we're going to the 7:30 show.

01:07:02.847 --> 01:07:08.847
No, I just got tickets on-line. Four adults, 7:30...
- I think Hope gets a student discount.

01:07:11.077 --> 01:07:15.877
You would need to show your student ID
and I left mine at home. I'll just get my own ticket.

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:18.099
It's fine, I got it.
- Okay.

01:07:20.288 --> 01:07:21.688
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:07:22.946 --> 01:07:25.646
You're sure? You look
so serious all of a sudden.

01:07:27.969 --> 01:07:32.369
I should probably tell you something.
I'm just sort of worried about ...

01:07:32.402 --> 01:07:36.202
what's gonna happen. You know,
when I turn my school paper in.

01:07:43.075 --> 01:07:47.175
Don't be ridiculous. You don't need an excuse
to hang out with us. Come on. let's go.

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:49.197
Come on.

01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:06.031
Wow! Mind blown. You totally hit it out of the park.

01:08:06.055 --> 01:08:09.055
And I'm gonna run this as the top story on our homepage.

01:08:10.988 --> 01:08:13.088
They give away the jars anonymously.

01:08:13.327 --> 01:08:15.627
They don't want any form of recognition.

01:08:16.642 --> 01:08:19.942
So they're reluctant heroes, that's fantastic!
We can add that in.

01:08:20.214 --> 01:08:22.714
The Maxwells have been so good to me.

01:08:23.335 --> 01:08:29.335
Hope, come on. I mean, you have written
a powerful story here, that has ....

01:08:29.345 --> 01:08:34.245
the potential to touch thousa... no, millions
of reader's lives. Inspire them even.

01:08:35.314 --> 01:08:39.714
Hey, that should be your focus.
Am I right as a journalist?

01:08:44.943 --> 01:08:50.443
Hi, Brandi. I have some people at reception
inquiring about advertising with us.

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:53.209
Great, thanks.

01:08:54.254 --> 01:08:57.354
Our classsified sales agent will be right with you.
- Thank you.

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:03.328
Come on, Hope. You should be proud of yourself.

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:07.407
I'm proud of you, even though
you drive me crazy right now.

01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:14.354
Lyle, I'm grateful for this opportunity.
I don't think hurting this family ...

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.361
for the sake of my career is worth it.
- Okay. I'm confused.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:22.689
Because you pitched me this story. Right?

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:25.810
I've been waiting for this story for the last three weeks.

01:09:26.251 --> 01:09:30.850
'Not quite. Not quite.'
Now it's ready. And now you want to pull the plug.

01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:33.587
Why don't you just grow up.
You're so overthinking this.

01:09:33.663 --> 01:09:36.863
The Maxwells will probably get a kick
of all this publicity.

01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:39.607
No, they won't.
- Yes, they will.

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.420
Hope, come on. Smarten up.

01:09:41.631 --> 01:09:42.631
Come on.

01:09:47.747 --> 01:09:48.747
Is that Hope?

01:09:50.496 --> 01:09:55.296
Hope, we're running the Christmas jar story
and that's final. I just sent it to the copy editor.

01:09:58.395 --> 01:09:59.395
Hope?

01:10:08.299 --> 01:10:10.299
Wow.
- Ian.

Those Mysterious Christmas Jars

01:10:59.053 --> 01:11:04.153
It's killing me to leave my baby behind. But I
can't bear the thought to see her suffer ...

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.040
as I have suffered the past few years.
Please tell het that I love her...

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.000
and that I pray to hold her again some day.

01:11:11.093 --> 01:11:13.193
That will forever be my hope.

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:44.498
I really miss you, mom.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.440
I messed up and I don't know
how to fix it.

01:12:05.586 --> 01:12:10.486
Ian, I'm so happy to see you.
- I just came to return your desk.

01:12:10.522 --> 01:12:12.222
Why don't you come in?

01:12:13.971 --> 01:12:18.171
I have other deliveries to make.
- Ian, wait!

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.940
I wanted to tell you the truth so many times.
But I was scared.

01:12:28.533 --> 01:12:31.333
Scared of what?
- I was scared of this moment.

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:37.090
I was scared of what you'd think of me.

01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:40.018
And that you might not ever forgive me.

01:12:41.953 --> 01:12:46.453
I didn't think I was gonna fall in love with you.
And your family, like I did.

01:12:48.907 --> 01:12:52.307
And I didn't know how to
come clean about anything.

01:12:53.771 --> 01:12:57.071
I just ...
I don't know what to believe anymore.

01:12:59.014 --> 01:13:01.414
Was that desk even your grandmother's?

01:13:06.993 --> 01:13:08.693
Ian, let me explain.

01:13:09.304 --> 01:13:12.504
Goodluck with your career.
I hope it was worth it.

01:13:15.733 --> 01:13:17.233
Ian!

01:13:41.603 --> 01:13:43.103
Cheer up!

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:47.702
They're never gonna forgive me.
- They'll come around. Give them some time.

01:13:51.518 --> 01:13:53.018
Nice ears!

01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:54.621
What?
- I said: nice ears.

01:13:56.752 --> 01:13:59.252
Hey! I like yours too.
Thank you.

01:14:00.618 --> 01:14:04.918
Hey, what do you think about masquerade
mondays as a way to beat back the monday blues?

01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:09.528
Masquerade mondays? You mean I'll have
an excuse to dress up every week?

01:14:09.533 --> 01:14:10.633
I love it!
- I love it!

01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:12.001
Eggnog?
- Eggnog?

01:14:14.118 --> 01:14:15.418
Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:14:17.849 --> 01:14:22.549
Hope, Hope! It's not every day somebody
has his first story on the homepage!

01:14:24.579 --> 01:14:26.479
Nice job!
- Thanks.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.085
Wait!  What's that?

01:14:30.965 --> 01:14:33.065
That's some house fire.

01:14:34.453 --> 01:14:38.953
A fire broke out in a family's home studio,
trapping a man in his fifties inside ...

01:14:38.959 --> 01:14:42.459
He still in critical condition in the hospital.
- I have to go!

01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:47.301
Your story is totally gone viral and the
Christmas Jar hashtag is trending.

01:14:50.142 --> 01:14:54.242
Lay it on me. I'm gonna be hiring you as a
full time writer in the new year.

01:14:55.638 --> 01:14:58.938
I have to go.
- Hope?

01:15:16.792 --> 01:15:19.392
What would you say is your company's purpose?

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:23.315
O, that's easy. We make damaged
furniture beautiful again.

01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:25.566
Clear and simple.
- It sure is.

01:15:26.226 --> 01:15:30.426
You can fix just about anything if
you apply enough love and elbow grease.

01:15:33.009 --> 01:15:37.209
You can fix just about anything if
you apply enough love and elbow grease.

01:15:56.627 --> 01:15:59.927
I wrote a follow-up piece.
- O. I never asked for that.

01:15:59.939 --> 01:16:04.539
You said the article went viral. Did you see how
many comments and questions there are?

01:16:04.701 --> 01:16:10.101
So you wrote a new article answering questions
from your old article. We don't do that.

01:16:12.182 --> 01:16:14.882
Please, Lyle.
I need to make this right.

01:16:20.287 --> 01:16:22.487
No promises. I give it a read.

01:16:31.823 --> 01:16:36.823
Many of you read my first article on the Christmas
Jar tradition. I was surprised and touched ...

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:41.558
by the extraordinary responses it created.
The truth is, I didn't tell the whole story.

01:16:41.588 --> 01:16:44.588
A few weeks ago my apartment
was broken into.

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:47.767
That same night I myself received
one of these Christmas jars.

01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:52.101
Hope got one too?
- Shhh, just listen.

01:16:52.938 --> 01:16:57.138
There was no note and no explanation.
I needed to find out where it came from.

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:03.200
I discovered there were others as well.
My investigation led me to the family behind it all.

01:17:04.439 --> 01:17:10.039
The Maxwells never sought the spotlight.
They taught me that people are mostly good.

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:15.795
We just need to be reminded of that sometimes.
And to look around and really see each other.

01:17:16.427 --> 01:17:18.727
Especially those who need a helping hand.

01:17:18.824 --> 01:17:24.424
I had just lost my mom to cancer and I was feeling
lost. The Maxwells openend their home to me.

01:17:24.503 --> 01:17:30.403
I felt like I belonged somewhere again. My deception
was repaid with nothing but kindness and compassion.

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:34.206
I revealed a secret that was not mine to share.

01:17:34.299 --> 01:17:38.799
And now I'm sad to report that the Maxwells
ate going through a tragedy of their own.

01:17:40.974 --> 01:17:45.774
Adam Maxwell is in the hospital fighting for his life,
so please keep him and his family in your prayers.

01:17:48.165 --> 01:17:52.265
And may the spirit of Christmas jars
live on in all of you.

01:18:25.876 --> 01:18:27.476
Come on in, please.

01:18:41.023 --> 01:18:44.423
How is your dad doing?
- We just got back from the hospital.

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:47.616
He's still in intubated in the ICU.

01:18:47.687 --> 01:18:52.787
They are worried about respiratory failure
from all the smoking chemicals he has inhaled.

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:55.092
Hannah, I'm so sorry about everything.

01:18:55.508 --> 01:18:57.508
I know you are. Come on in.

01:19:11.137 --> 01:19:13.137
I'm so sorry about Adam.
- Thank you.

01:19:20.419 --> 01:19:26.919
And I'm sorry for what I did to you.
For lying to you and for exposing your secret.

01:19:28.098 --> 01:19:33.098
I trusted you.
- I know you did. And I'm so sorry.

01:19:36.391 --> 01:19:42.591
I wanted to tell you the truth. No, I didn't,
but I just got so far in with all lies ....

01:19:42.676 --> 01:19:47.376
that I couldnt find a way out.
That's all I really wanted to say.

01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:55.691
And of course that I am keeping Adam and
you all in my prayers.

01:19:59.304 --> 01:20:01.004
Do you want to stay for dinner?

01:20:05.224 --> 01:20:07.124
I would really love to.

01:20:09.402 --> 01:20:13.902
I really would, but my mom and I
always spent Christmas eve at the diner.

01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:20.761
Though she's not here, it felt that if I were there,
then she would be with me.

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:24.109
Of course.

01:20:24.642 --> 01:20:26.642
I could come with you if you want.

01:20:28.688 --> 01:20:31.188
Thanks, Jake.
I'll be okay.

01:20:31.253 --> 01:20:33.053
You should stay here with your family.

01:20:35.313 --> 01:20:37.213
Ian, would you walk me out?

01:20:50.309 --> 01:20:54.409
I know I screwed up.
And I know you might not ever forgive me.

01:20:58.099 --> 01:21:02.699
So, if I never see you again, I want you
to know that I really do care about you.

01:21:06.369 --> 01:21:08.369
That part was never a lie.

01:21:14.248 --> 01:21:15.948
I got to go.

01:21:33.187 --> 01:21:34.987
Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.580
Why don't we play a game or something,
instead of standing around staring at each other?

01:21:41.615 --> 01:21:42.615
Good idea.

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:46.496
She must have forgot something.

01:21:48.553 --> 01:21:51.553
How about a game of cards?
- I got them.

01:21:52.012 --> 01:21:53.412
Alright, here you go.

01:21:58.262 --> 01:22:00.662
It wasn't Hope.
- Who was it?

01:22:00.697 --> 01:22:03.897
It was this woman and her little boy.
They gave this to me.

01:22:05.634 --> 01:22:08.434
All she said was thank you and God bless you.

01:22:11.362 --> 01:22:12.562
I'll get it.

01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:14.329
Let me see that jar.

01:22:21.932 --> 01:22:23.932
I got three more!
- Proper!

01:22:25.248 --> 01:22:28.048
People who want us to know they're thinking of us.

01:22:28.615 --> 01:22:32.515
I want to get that one!
- This is amazing, but I don't understand.

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:35.581
They're saying thank you.
That's all.

01:22:35.871 --> 01:22:38.571
You better come and see this.

01:22:54.997 --> 01:22:56.697
Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.973
Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:23:03.958 --> 01:23:04.958
My goodness, thank you.

01:23:07.427 --> 01:23:08.427
Merry Christmas.

01:24:09.148 --> 01:24:11.148
Mrs. Maxwell?
- Yes.

01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:16.689
I'm so sorry to bother you. I know it must be
a very tough time. I just felt like I had to come.

01:24:19.813 --> 01:24:22.513
Would you like to come in?
- Thank you.

01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:28.132
I used to live near here when I was a newly wed.
- That's a happy time.

01:24:28.218 --> 01:24:33.218
Some of it was happy, but not much of it.
My husband had a very bad temper.

01:24:37.209 --> 01:24:39.509
Everything okay, mom?
- Come, join us.

01:24:41.157 --> 01:24:44.857
These are my two oldest, Hannah and Ian.
My son in law Dustin.

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:48.664
I'm sorry, I just realized
I didn't ask you your name.

01:24:48.694 --> 01:24:50.994
It's Marianne.
- Nice to meet you.

01:24:52.195 --> 01:24:54.595
So nice to meet you all.

01:24:55.041 --> 01:24:57.341
Please, go on with your story.

01:25:01.039 --> 01:25:06.039
My ex-husband was a very violent man.
When I was nine months pregnant ...

01:25:06.776 --> 01:25:12.776
he beat me so badly that I thought
I was going to die. But I didn't.

01:25:14.734 --> 01:25:17.234
I survived and so did my baby.

01:25:18.964 --> 01:25:21.764
I gave birth to her at home.
By yourself?

01:25:21.971 --> 01:25:25.971
Yeah. I never had any friends back then.
He made sure of it.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:32.580
I didn't have money for a doctor. He cleaned out
our savings account and took everything.

01:25:34.434 --> 01:25:41.034
The rent was overdue, utilities shut off,
and there I was, freezing with a newborn ...

01:25:41.089 --> 01:25:44.289
in an apartment, wallpaper
was eviction notices.

01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:49.149
I had nowhere to go. No one to turn to.

01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:56.444
I was inconsolable.
I could barely breathe, after ...

01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:00.410
After what?

01:26:03.464 --> 01:26:09.364
I gave her away. I gave my baby away.

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:16.966
I didn't know where to go. No one to turn to.

01:26:22.287 --> 01:26:26.387
And out of nowhere

01:26:27.764 --> 01:26:29.764
Just this little angel.

01:26:34.381 --> 01:26:36.981
She gave me this jar full of change.

01:26:40.366 --> 01:26:43.066
I just sat there. I couldn't believe it.

01:26:45.787 --> 01:26:47.287
It's amazing.

01:26:48.509 --> 01:26:52.409
That money did more than help me to survive.
It renewed my faith.

01:26:54.297 --> 01:26:57.197
So I could pick myself up and carry on.

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.978
What happened to the baby?

01:27:01.005 --> 01:27:07.205
I left her in a little diner.
I know it sounds terrible. It was terrible.

01:27:09.851 --> 01:27:15.851
There was something in the kindness in
my waitresses eyes, the friendly owners, ...

01:27:18.114 --> 01:27:20.214
it made it seem safer.

01:27:22.378 --> 01:27:26.978
I just knew that  someone else could give her
a better shot at life than I could.

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:32.540
But I think about her every day.

01:27:34.423 --> 01:27:36.423
Marianne, have you had dinner yet?

01:27:58.022 --> 01:28:00.222
Do you want us to come in with you?

01:28:01.168 --> 01:28:04.168
Thanks, but I need to do this on my own.

01:28:39.194 --> 01:28:40.794
Hope?

01:29:07.178 --> 01:29:10.678
I think this is the same booth.
- It is.

01:29:20.968 --> 01:29:23.268
I'm sorry, this is so awkward.

01:29:23.284 --> 01:29:28.284
I thought about this day for so long, and
now that it's here, I don't know what to say.

01:29:55.839 --> 01:29:58.939
That was the worst day of my life
when I wrote that.

01:29:59.834 --> 01:30:01.334
It's okay.

01:30:02.662 --> 01:30:04.162
I'm sorry.

01:30:05.837 --> 01:30:07.837
I'm okay.

01:30:10.137 --> 01:30:12.537
And I'm really happy with you here.

01:30:13.901 --> 01:30:15.401
Me too.

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:24.216
Did your mom name you Hope?
- Yeah.

01:30:27.501 --> 01:30:29.501
Ohh! I'm Marianne.

01:30:31.901 --> 01:30:35.201
It's nice to meet you, Marianne.
- Me too.

01:30:37.379 --> 01:30:40.279
We have the same nose.
- Yeah, we do.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.380
ONE YEAR LATER

01:31:09.386 --> 01:31:12.186
O, there's that huge ring blinding me.

01:31:14.255 --> 01:31:16.255
O, so beautiful.

01:31:16.447 --> 01:31:19.847
Thanks for making me look bad, Ian.
- O stop.

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:22.307
Who wants turkey?
- I do!!

01:31:23.869 --> 01:31:26.869
Raise 'em up, that's it.

01:31:29.536 --> 01:31:34.136
As this family gets any bigger,
we will need two turkeys next year.

01:31:34.218 --> 01:31:36.218
And two Christmas jars.

01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:38.410
True!
