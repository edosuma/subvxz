16:56.390 --> 16:58.808
Right then. And what's
my other thing I say?

16:58.809 --> 17:00.907
My motto?

17:02.647 --> 17:08.329
At the death, who is left
holding the sodding baby?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.961
No, go on, what else?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.035
Harry Flowers.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.384
Right again.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.250
Me.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.459
Me.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.433
Me.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.484
Me.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.638
All right. At ease, gentlemen.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.862
Anyone for a nightcap?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.917
- POLICEMAN: We need a signed statement.
- JOEY: What for?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.754
POLICEMAN: Containing your
allegations against Mr. Flowers.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.173
- Allegations?
- POLICEMAN: Allegations.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.343
Found it outside. Clean it.
Lots of filth around.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.022
JOEY:
Yeah, cheers, Steve. Uh, listen...

18:59.430 --> 19:03.767
I'm not making actual allegations.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.911
I can't do that.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.869
Well, I mean, I...

19:09.607 --> 19:14.378
I got no proof, have I?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.864
Looks like you've got a
war on your hands, Joey.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.324
JOEY: I'll give a grand...

19:19.325 --> 19:24.329
if I could get that Mr. Harry
"Pervert" Flowers...

19:24.330 --> 19:26.164
right here, right now.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.458
I'll give a grand in readies.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.807
Dirty degenerate.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.726
Will I do?

19:35.049 --> 19:36.466
JOEY: What?

19:36.467 --> 19:41.398
I'd have rung up first, Joey,
but your lines is always busy.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.903
All five of them.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.693
- Let's go.
- What do you mean?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.588
Harry Flowers is waiting for you.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.411
That geezer,
that's the one, isn't it?

20:04.412 --> 20:07.386
- Eh, Joey?
- You stay out of this.

20:10.835 --> 20:14.730
Hold up, that was him
that left with him.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.340
HARRY: Look at this Vietnam strife.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.175
Down with red tape, eh?

20:19.176 --> 20:21.428
No taxman around here, my son.

20:21.429 --> 20:24.347
JOEY: But, Harry, I'm still a
bit worried about my future.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.683
Worried? That I will
not allow, my son.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.060
Anyone worries you,
you tell me about it.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.105
You're on the firm now, Joey.
One of me own.

20:32.106 --> 20:35.775
United we stand, divided
we're lumbered.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.528
Took over? No, Joey.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.572
The word is "merged."

20:40.573 --> 20:42.824
You was merged, my son.
To old England.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.172
(WOMAN LAUGHS)

20:44.577 --> 20:47.203
Jack, tell Chas to come over
and have one with us, eh?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.873
- Yeah, sure, Harry.
- Harry, that shop...

20:49.874 --> 20:52.459
- Exactly.
- Listen, no, it's my whole life, Harry.

20:52.460 --> 20:56.755
Exactly, Joey. Mine too. Mine too.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.590
Speaking of which, Dennis...

20:58.591 --> 21:01.426
I'm not at all happy about
the tactless manner...

21:01.427 --> 21:03.887
which Joey was brought here in.

21:03.888 --> 21:07.223
Chas, I told you not to bother
Mr. Maddocks, didn't I?

21:07.224 --> 21:08.641
A whiskey, please, Dave.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.269
- Right away, Chas.
- Oh, was I tactless?

21:11.270 --> 21:15.732
Making him say that thing about
his poor dead father? My God.

21:15.733 --> 21:19.152
- Let's take this chat upstairs, shall we?
- Who do you think you are?

21:19.153 --> 21:20.403
The Lone Ranger?

21:20.404 --> 21:23.878
- I know who I am, Harry.
- HARRY: Of course you do, son.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.659
You're Jack the Lad.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.995
I've known a few
performers in my time.

21:28.996 --> 21:32.391
But I tell you this,
he's got the gift, boy.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.266
- Right, Denny?
- He enjoys his work.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.173
- That's the half of it.
- Do you think he does, Denny?

21:40.174 --> 21:44.052
- Oh, I do. I get a load of kicks out of it.
- Which can be a good thing, Chas.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.650
CHAS: Putting a little stick about.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.365
Putting the frighteners
on flash little twerps.

21:48.766 --> 21:53.770
But it can also be a tricky thing.
And I'll tell you why.

21:53.771 --> 21:57.941
Because you can get to enjoy
your work too much, my son.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.916
And it can slip your mind that...

22:01.111 --> 22:04.113
you're bloody working
for me, you berk!

22:04.114 --> 22:08.243
And when I say me, I mean...
Tell him what I mean, Jack.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.578
- You mean, um, you, Harry.
- No.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.121
- The business.
- The business.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.123
- That's what he means.
- Correct him one.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.125
DENNIS: In which you're a cog, boy.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.294
A cog in an organ.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.798
- Go to hell, Dennis. I know what I am.
- It's the business of business...

22:21.799 --> 22:23.442
to push the buttons.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.438
And I'm alive and well.

22:28.389 --> 22:32.159
You push the buttons on that thing.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.978
Right. We push them. Us.

22:34.979 --> 22:38.815
This terrific democratic
organization. Right, Joey?

22:38.816 --> 22:41.276
- Right, Harry.
- Same again. All around, Dave.

22:41.277 --> 22:44.487
- Let me do this one, Harry.
- The world's a dodgy place, my friends.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.156
I can't help that.
But we've got progress.

No. No. I'm not one of those.

"You call that rock 'n' roll?"

35:34.049 --> 35:37.569
I said, "That's the sound, Mr. Payne.
That's what I'm selling you, man."

35:37.594 --> 35:41.221
He said, "My God, that's a black sound.
It's four times blacker than you."

35:41.222 --> 35:42.931
Liverpool. Tsk.

35:42.932 --> 35:46.101
NOEL: So I said, "Cool it, man.
Cool it. It's a bad sound."

35:46.102 --> 35:48.103
WOMAN: I'll tell you who
comes from Liverpool.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.064
- Mary Tinkling.
- "I'll buy it," he says.

35:50.065 --> 35:53.233
- "You got a gig for six weeks."
- He's a shrewd one, is that.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.778
So Mr. Turner's gonna sublet
your room then, is he?

35:55.779 --> 35:59.049
NOEL:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.632
I told him.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.078
I said, "Turner,
you are my landlord...

36:04.079 --> 36:08.082
to which I owe 41
pound back rent...

36:08.083 --> 36:11.933
which I will send to you
from Liverpool pretty soon."

36:12.045 --> 36:15.756
He said, "Yeah?" So I said,
"Listen. Listen, baby.

36:27.102 --> 36:30.326
He says, "Okay, my son, go."

36:30.563 --> 36:32.898
I should try to find
a cool subtenant...

- NOEL: Come on, Mom. He's just like...
- He's peculiar.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.844
He's peculiar. He's a hermit.

in the language of Persia...

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:01.963
Hassan-i-Sabbah.

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:05.091
And his people were
called the Hashishin.

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:07.427
He had caused a valley
between two mountains...

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:10.638
to be enclosed and
turned into a garden...

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:15.476
so large and beautiful his
people believed it was paradise.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:17.895
And there was a fortress
at the entrance...

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:21.065
strong enough to
resist all the world.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:24.277
Now, the old man who caused
those of his young men...

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:26.863
whom he had chosen to
be his Hashishin...

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:33.244
his assassins, to be given a potion
which cast them into a deep sleep.

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:35.121
And to be carried
into the garden...

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:39.375
so that when they awoke they
believed they were in paradise.

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:42.295
And there were damsels
and young girls there...

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:44.881
who dallied with them to
their hearts' content...

01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:48.903
so that they had what
young men desire.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.679
Thus it was, that when
the old man decided...

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.098
to send one of his assassins
upon a mission...

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.184
such as to have a prince slain...

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:58.811
he would send for one of
these youths and say:

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.688
'Go thou and kill...

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:04.859
and when thou returnest my angels
shall bear thee into paradise.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.820
And shouldest thou die,
nevertheless...

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:12.533
I will send my angels to carry
you back into paradise."

it a bit too clearly.

And he was just a beautiful, little,
freaky, stripy beast, darling.

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.817
Uh, Tony, uh...

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:20.052
I owe you for this.

01:33:20.053 --> 01:33:21.720
I'm going to miss you, Tone.

01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:24.098
Yeah, I'll miss you too, boy.

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:26.725
Well, um... Well, good night.

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:28.685
Good night. I'll call you at 9.

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:31.239
- God bless.
- Thanks, Tone.

01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:34.441
Thank you, Tony.

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:38.963
A wise head on... Still on
those young shoulders, eh?

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:43.283
Ah. So he forgot, did he?

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:47.430
Forgot but not forgiven, eh, Moody?

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.765
Pardon?

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:54.846
ROSEBLOOM: It's funny. Wouldn't
you say that was unlike him, Tony?

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:57.598
(CHUCKLES)

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:02.858
ROSEBLOOM: It's unlike him to
forget an important thing.

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:13.063
Why is he going to America?

01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:15.607
TURNER: Why? I don't know.

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:18.068
Place to go, isn't it,
for gangsters?

01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:19.528
I don't think so.

01:34:19.529 --> 01:34:21.831
He's going to get in
some bad scenes again.

01:34:22.198 --> 01:34:24.876
He should go here. Look.

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:27.553
Hmm?

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.051
LUCY: The mountains of Persia.

01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:32.875
TURNER:
Yeah, maybe. Maybe you're right.

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:35.975
I'm sure there's some
bandits over there.

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:37.977
- Don't you think?
- TURNER: Mm, could be.

01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:40.896
Yeah, I'll tell him.

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:42.885
LUCY: I'll tell him.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.970
Tell me something.

01:34:44.971 --> 01:34:48.932
Do you think the mountains would
be improved without the bandits?

01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:50.267
LUCY: Mm.

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:51.945
(LUCY SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:17.266
CHAS: Oh, my God.

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:24.360
I feel like I've been
through a cement mixer.

01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:45.072
(LUCY SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:48.172
- CHAS: French, eh?
- LUCY: Yes, I'm French.

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:52.955
(CHUCKLES)

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:56.851
- CHAS: You're a funny little frog.
- LUCY: Yes.

01:35:58.169 --> 01:36:00.813
- CHAS: You've got small titties, eh?
- LUCY: Yes.

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:04.049
CHAS: A bit underdeveloped?

01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:07.302
Yes. What does that mean?

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:11.153
You're very skinny. Like a
little boy or something.

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:15.237
LUCY: Some they mistake this.

01:36:17.855 --> 01:36:19.577
Mm.

01:36:25.238 --> 01:36:27.791
Lousy morning.

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:32.119
LUCY: This is for you. I found it.

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.764
- It's an amethyst.
- Yes.

01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:38.750
It's a purple amethyst.

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:40.348
Yeah.

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:46.300
You can have this too.

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:48.274
This is a magic one.

01:36:48.594 --> 01:36:50.191
CHAS: Oh.

01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:52.023
Is it?

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:54.742
Thanks.

01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:03.775
LUCY: Pherber's got a visa.

01:37:03.776 --> 01:37:06.069
They don't wanna give you a visa?

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:09.044
- No.
- Why not?

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:10.758
Uh-.

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:12.492
I don't know why not.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:13.702
Because you're foreign.

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:15.245
(LUCY GIGGLES)

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:17.539
He likes foreign birds,
that Turner.

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.763
LUCY: Maybe I go with you. Why not?

01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:24.263
LUCY:
But I don't want to go to America.

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:33.972
I wish you'd be a bandit in Persia.

01:37:33.973 --> 01:37:36.901
- CHAS: What's your name?
- Lucy.

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:48.987
CHAS: He's got talent.
He shouldn't have retired.

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:51.114
He should keep at it.

01:37:51.115 --> 01:37:53.258
LUCY: He's stuck.

01:37:54.452 --> 01:37:57.255
Everyone knows who
he is still, don't they?

01:37:58.623 --> 01:38:00.300
He likes you.

01:38:01.834 --> 01:38:04.057
Stay till tomorrow.

01:38:05.338 --> 01:38:09.688
I can't. I got to go
along in a little while.

01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:12.941
I've got to go too.

01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:16.858
Maybe Pherber will come with me.

01:38:17.475 --> 01:38:19.101
For holidays.

01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:20.949
In the mountains.

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.990
Oh, merde, shampoo.

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:29.378
It's upstairs in the bathroom.

01:38:33.783 --> 01:38:35.700
I'll get it for you.

01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:37.253
Thanks.

01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:46.680
Ah.

01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:56.864
We've got to get off, Chas.
Harry's waiting for you.

01:38:58.057 --> 01:38:59.474
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:01.935
Some of the chaps come
up to see you too.

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:03.954
To see how you are.

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:11.670
Rosie, I've got to pop
upstairs for a second.

01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:13.793
No.

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.034
We've not got time.

01:39:18.035 --> 01:39:20.337
We've got to get
down to the country.

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:23.540
We got time.

01:39:23.541 --> 01:39:25.434
We got a minute.

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:29.305
Else you'll have to give
it to me right here.

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:33.192
Right here.

01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:37.730
Won't you, Rosie?

01:39:42.894 --> 01:39:46.198
All right. Make it two minutes.

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:50.275
You'll let me have the shooter
as soon as you come down.

01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:51.919
Right?

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.418
Right.

01:39:58.784 --> 01:40:01.837
There's a couple of chaps
on the roof, Chas.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:04.006
A couple in the garden.

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.931
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:24.643
I've got to be off now.

01:40:24.644 --> 01:40:27.145
No, I'm gonna talk
to you some more.

01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:28.730
No, I gotta shoot off now.

01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:31.284
TURNER:
I might come with you, then.

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:57.602
(SCOFFS)

01:40:58.344 --> 01:41:01.067
You don't know where
I'm going, pal.

01:41:03.474 --> 01:41:05.367
I do.

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:45.657
I don't know.

01:41:50.396 --> 01:41:52.539
Yeah, you do.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:58.078
(GUN CLICKS)

01:41:59.238 --> 01:42:00.447

LUCY: Chas.

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:36.746
Chas.

01:43:46.387 --> 01:43:48.189
