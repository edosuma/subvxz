00:42.833 --> 00:43.666
You...

00:43.666 --> 00:44.833
...killed him?

00:48.458 --> 00:49.666
Chula can help you.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.958
generations are

00:57.958 --> 00:58.875
echoing...

01:00.250 --> 01:01.166
reaching out...

01:05.500 --> 01:06.375
the most.

01:11.041 --> 01:12.416
I needed you.

01:13.583 --> 01:14.958
But you chose yourself!

02:43.625 --> 02:45.333
It's hurt.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.500
I found it.

02:47.916 --> 02:50.000
It fell from a tree.

03:01.166 --> 03:05.166
The bird didn't just fall, did it?

03:06.500 --> 03:10.041
I didn't mean to hurt it.

03:10.541 --> 03:12.250
I just wanted to see

03:12.250 --> 03:14.291
if I could hit it.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.708
I'm sorry.

03:19.041 --> 03:21.666
You can't do this.

03:22.083 --> 03:25.250
We don't harm living things.

03:25.750 --> 03:28.625
In the old days,

03:28.625 --> 03:31.833
the Choctaw called it

03:31.833 --> 03:34.708
the Biskinik.

03:34.958 --> 03:38.375
The Choctaw would tell the bird
what to say,

03:38.541 --> 03:44.791
and it would tap out
messages on the trees,

03:45.291 --> 03:49.833
warning when enemies approached.

03:50.416 --> 03:53.958
We can fix it right?

08:08.041 --> 08:09.791
I will see you later.

12:58.416 --> 12:59.375
Mama?

13:13.666 --> 13:17.041
You've really been hurting, huh?

13:33.291 --> 13:36.333
You aren't alone.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.458
All of us that came before

13:38.458 --> 13:41.000
are a part of you.

13:41.208 --> 13:46.291
Because we echo through you.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.458
Echo.

14:03.083 --> 14:06.916
Now it's time for the pain...

14:06.916 --> 14:08.833
to go away.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.458
I can't.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.458
I don't know how.

14:13.541 --> 14:16.083
I will help you.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.833
Your ancestors will help you.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.541
You come from a long line

14:22.541 --> 14:24.875
of very special women.

14:24.875 --> 14:28.875
All the way from Chafa herself.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.291
They have carried the fire.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.500
They were the protectors

14:33.500 --> 14:35.250
of their people.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.208
They fought for their family.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.708
Now, it's your turn.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.208
All I bring is danger.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.750
I have to leave.

14:49.958 --> 14:51.500
Don't run.

14:51.875 --> 14:52.958
Stay.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.250
Fight.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.208
For us.

14:58.166 --> 15:02.375
Remember your gifts.

15:03.833 --> 15:06.375
Strategy.

15:07.625 --> 15:10.250
Cunning.

15:11.291 --> 15:12.541
Ferocity.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.458
Love.

15:19.916 --> 15:22.250
All of that

15:22.791 --> 15:25.750
is infused in this...

15:32.000 --> 15:35.916
Every seam on the suit shows

15:35.916 --> 15:38.458
that you're part of us.

15:38.458 --> 15:41.541
And we're part of you.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.708
I love you.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.541
Always.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.541
I offered you everything.

23:21.958 --> 23:24.791
How could you betray me like this?

23:25.375 --> 23:27.500
Who betrayed who first?

23:48.291 --> 23:51.416
You brought this upon yourself!

23:51.875 --> 23:55.000
They have nothing to do with this!

23:55.833 --> 23:57.958
They're in my blood, in my heart.

23:57.958 --> 24:01.583
I'm a part of them,
and they're a part of me.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.583
I'm their legacy...

24:03.875 --> 24:05.666
...not yours.

24:10.125 --> 24:13.083
Good, now I know how much it will hurt you

24:14.666 --> 24:18.166
when I kill the rest of your family.

24:21.083 --> 24:24.208
Just like I killed your father!

24:59.666 --> 25:00.750
Echo.

25:13.666 --> 25:15.000
Trust me.

27:54.916 --> 27:55.958
Don't listen anymore.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.708
Let go of the pain.
Let go of the anger.

28:00.583 --> 28:01.958
You are my uncle.

28:04.125 --> 28:05.083
Shut him out!

28:21.083 --> 28:23.083
Give it to me, please.

28:26.583 --> 28:27.708
Please.

29:24.916 --> 29:29.500
Will we ever see it again?

29:29.750 --> 29:30.875
Of course.
