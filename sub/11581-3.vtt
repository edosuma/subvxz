NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.171 --> 00:05.806
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.242
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.276 --> 00:10.144
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.178 --> 00:11.712
are members of an elite squad

00:11.745 --> 00:13.547
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.417
These are their stories.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.518
Okay, I think

00:17.551 --> 00:19.687
I've soaked up
enough atmosphere
for one night.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.190
That paraplegic
hooker's good for
two chapters alone.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.624
Open those doors
to perception,

00:23.657 --> 00:25.726
I'll promise,
you'll have an entire novel.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.028
Enrique?

00:30.631 --> 00:33.167
Ricardo down at the Java Barn
in SoHo said

00:33.201 --> 00:34.468
you could hook us up?

00:34.502 --> 00:35.636
Twenty bucks.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.105
That sounds reasonable.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.212
And you have
something for us?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.147
That was just the house fee.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.182
Enrique's downstairs,

00:48.216 --> 00:50.351
third door on your left.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.355
It's the second door
on the left, right?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.489
I don't know.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.591
I'm just trying not
to pee my pants.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.266
Enrique?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.669
I don't think
we're in the
right room.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.671
Who cares?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.406
We're still
going to score.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.175
I'll flip you to see
who does her first.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.176
You're a sick freak.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.177
She's unconscious.

01:16.210 --> 01:16.977
She is totally hot.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.412
Come on, man.
It's now or never.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.280
Once you shoot the H,

01:19.313 --> 01:20.814
you won't even
be able to get it up.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.483
Then why the hell
would anyone do it?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.317
Police! Don't move.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.186
Keep those hands
where we can see them.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.086
Down, down, down!

01:26.120 --> 01:27.688
Hey, tighty-whitey,
no funny business.

01:27.721 --> 01:28.889
I tripped!
Okay, lady.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.358
Let's get our clothes on.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.560
Lady, wake up.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.563
Hey, Will, I don't think
this one came here on her own.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.565
Well-groomed.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.300
No track marks,

01:39.333 --> 01:41.702
looks like she took
a nasty blow to the head.

01:41.735 --> 01:42.836
Any ID?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.572
Nada.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.274
Caught that one
with his pants down,

01:46.307 --> 01:47.408
just about to do her.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.542
You don't say.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.178
I was just trying
to help her up.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.246
With your penis?

01:54.282 --> 01:55.216
How she doing?

01:55.249 --> 01:57.285
Stable, but she hasn't
regained consciousness.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.220
Elliot, the
Fitzsimmons trial.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.588
It's one of the victims?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.690
No, the expert witness.
Doctor...

02:02.723 --> 02:04.325
Greta something...
Heints.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.227
Greta Heints.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.262
She's the woman who thinks
she can fix rapists.

02:12.333 --> 02:16.537
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:16.570 --> 02:20.408
and NBC

02:59.880 --> 03:01.782
Dr. Greta Heints,
top forensic psychiatrist,

03:01.815 --> 03:03.451
teaches at Hudson
Medical School...

03:03.484 --> 03:04.752
Yeah, but spends most
of her time

03:04.785 --> 03:05.986
trying to cure sex offenders.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.355
She even wrote
a book on it.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.889
Yeah, I read it.
It's a load of crap.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.991
Any records on the two losers
they found her with?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.394
Clean. Claims they were
doing research for their art.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.663
Well, what kind of research
was our noted shrink doing

03:15.696 --> 03:16.530
in a shooting gallery?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.232
I don't know, but
the hospital said

03:18.266 --> 03:19.400
her tox screen
was negative.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.334
Rape kit?

03:20.368 --> 03:21.935
No fluids, but signs
of external trauma.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.771
They said they'll call
when she comes to.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.905
Get your hands
off me, fool.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.274
Where have Munch and Fin been?

03:26.307 --> 03:27.841
Narcotics. Working
through the addicts

03:27.875 --> 03:29.243
picked up in the raid.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.778
You're not going
to put him in
here, are you?

03:30.811 --> 03:31.812
What'd you two pendejos

03:31.845 --> 03:32.913
tell them? Ow!

03:32.946 --> 03:34.482
Look at that.
They're old friends.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.617
I swear, sir, we didn't say
a word about your job there.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.618
What job?

03:37.651 --> 03:38.786
I was just hanging.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.321
That makes you
a material witness.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.655
Which means
that we can keep you

03:41.689 --> 03:42.723
in here a good long time.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.292
Sooner you talk,
sooner you walk.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.426
I don't know nothing.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.827
Don't sell yourself short.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.696
Hey, what about us?
We didn't do anything.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.630
FIN:
How do we know

03:49.663 --> 03:51.965
you're not the ones
who attacked that woman?

03:51.999 --> 03:52.866
We just got there.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.603
Ask that nice gentleman
with the tattoos.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.804
When did they get there?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.706
They came in a minute
before the bust.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.541
I knew
those cholos are bad luck.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.578
What time did she arrive?

04:04.612 --> 04:05.713
What do I look like, a doorman?

04:05.746 --> 04:06.847
No, more like a lowly look-out

04:06.880 --> 04:08.282
who saw everyone
coming and going.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.584
You got me confused
with someone else.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.454
Oh, yeah? Javier
Francisco Medina, aka Bad-Ass.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.856
Possession, Possession
with Intent to Sell,

04:15.889 --> 04:17.625
Menacing in the First Degree,

04:17.658 --> 04:18.759
Criminal Facilitation.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.428
Shall I go on?
All right, all right.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.862
Not a lot
of room left

04:21.895 --> 04:23.897
on that rap
sheet of yours.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.933
She came in a half hour
before the raid.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.935
She walk in,
or somebody carry her in?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.069
Walked.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.404
With?

04:30.438 --> 04:31.439
Alone.
For what?

04:31.472 --> 04:32.906
One of those do-gooders.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.041
Bad for business.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.676
I didn't want to let her in.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.910
So, why did you?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.613
She said a patient
was in trouble inside.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.649
She seemed desperate.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.987
Okay, she gave me 40 bucks.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.522
( knocking )

04:49.557 --> 04:51.325
Hospital called.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.594
Doctor's awake.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.465
BENSON:
Dr. Heints,

04:57.498 --> 04:59.467
can you tell us
who attacked you?

04:59.500 --> 05:00.601
No. I-I'm sorry.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.569
Apparently, the trauma

05:01.602 --> 05:03.437
to my head has caused
retrograde amnesia.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.972
What's the last
thing you remember?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.074
Leaving the Hamptons
late on Sunday.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.042
And we got home
just before 10:00.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.711
Uh, the phone was ringing.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.845
Who was it?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.515
Patient line. I know
by now not to ask.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.517
She went out right after that.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.018
How many of your
patients live or work

05:18.051 --> 05:19.119
in Washington Heights?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.854
I'm not sure any of them do.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.890
We're going to
need a list.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.125
I can't do that.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.727
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.962
Honey, you do enough
for them. Please.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.531
BENSON:
You are obligated

05:30.564 --> 05:32.966
to report them if they're a risk
to themselves or others.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.702
DR. HEINTS:
If I had a name
to report,

05:34.735 --> 05:37.137
which I don't.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.039
I have no idea
who did this,

05:39.072 --> 05:42.643
and I can't have
you traumatizing
the innocent ones.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.877
You treat rapists.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.046
None of them
are innocent.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.086
I'm sorry.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.056
She's pretty uncooperative.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.725
Her hands are tied.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.159
What was your take
on the husband?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.494
Loves her, hates her job.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.662
Well, how would
you like it

06:01.695 --> 06:03.397
if Kathy was treating
sex offenders,

06:03.431 --> 06:04.465
one-on-one,
every day?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.599
Wouldn't let her.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.634
Let her?

06:06.667 --> 06:07.768
Did I say that?

06:07.801 --> 06:10.170
Look, you know, these skels
are only going to see Dr. H.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.772
because the court
ordered them to.

06:11.805 --> 06:12.940
Making it
public record.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.108
Want to drive?

06:17.845 --> 06:19.813
MAN:
Well, let's see.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.082
Out of the 500 parolees
I supervise a year,

06:22.115 --> 06:23.817
I farm out about
50 per shrink.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.153
I figure a good portion
of those have reoffended,

06:26.186 --> 06:27.054
gone back to prison.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.457
Then some finish out,
move away, die,

06:29.490 --> 06:31.492
or just disappear.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.626
How many go straight?

06:32.660 --> 06:33.761
That's a good one.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.563
How many are seeing Dr. Heints
right now?

06:35.596 --> 06:36.530
Two dozen.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.566
That's still a long
list. Who do you like?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.700
( sighs )

06:39.733 --> 06:40.901
This guy, Bruce Horton.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.803
He came back
after a few sessions,

06:42.836 --> 06:45.773
said he'd rip her guts out
if he had to see her again.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.207
What was his problem?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.642
Her method.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.978
It's a little unorthodox.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.547
She's a freak.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.682
Takes one to know one.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.816
What did she do?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.150
The bitch tried
to emasculate me.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.486
STABLER:
Come on.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.620
A big guy like you?

06:59.653 --> 07:00.621
She told me to

07:00.654 --> 07:02.590
suck my thumb.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.591
Excuse me?

07:03.624 --> 07:04.758
She's into that

07:04.792 --> 07:06.760
inner child crap.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.597
Gave me stuffed animals,
read me bedtime stories.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.766
She even had me call her Mommy.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.901
( knife chopping )

07:13.934 --> 07:15.035
That monster.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.203
Where were you Sunday night?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.905
I was here working
a double shift.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.840
We'll be checking on that.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.075
Who you should be checking
out is that quack.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.745
Her therapy backfired.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.113
That a confession?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.881
No.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.016
But I got to tell you,

07:29.049 --> 07:31.018
her program made me want
to go out

07:31.051 --> 07:35.022
and prove my manhood,
if you know what I mean.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.725
Dr. Heints is a pioneer
in the field.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.959
She operates on the assumption

07:38.992 --> 07:41.562
that all sex offenders were
themselves abused as children.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.563
Well, how is that new?

07:42.596 --> 07:43.564
Most were.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.699
Greta believes
that if they can be regressed

07:45.733 --> 07:47.668
back to the time
of their original trauma,

07:47.701 --> 07:50.037
she can reparent them
in a correctively emotional way.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.772
Healing their
psychic boo-boos.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.041
It's cutting edge,
but the jury's still out.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.743
Well, what
do you think?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.711
Regressing violent criminals
can be dangerous,

07:57.745 --> 07:59.547
but if she can find a way
to make it work,

07:59.580 --> 08:00.714
she'd be a hero.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.049
Sexual predators
can't be changed.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.517
All you can do
is lock them up.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.118
Yeah, but sooner or later,
they get out.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.286
Seven out of ten rape again.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.855
As least
she's trying something.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.289
What's wrong with
civil commitment?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.892
Ah, yes, after prison,
toss them in the nuthouse.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.827
Punish them twice
for the same crime.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.629
Goes over gangbusters
at the ACLU.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.765
Greta serves on the Civil
Commitment Review Board.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.166
CRAGEN:
You're kidding.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.869
They just let out
their first committed rapist.

08:21.902 --> 08:22.803
Yeah, Benny Edgar Ralsay.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.672
He raped seven women
up in Albany, right?

08:24.705 --> 08:25.505
CRAGEN
Wrong.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.207
That's just how many
they got him on.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.609
He did 30 or 40.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.544
They called him
the Duct Tape Rapist.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.279
HUANG:
The day he got out of prison,

08:32.312 --> 08:34.715
he was civilly committed
to the state psych hospital.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.849
BENSON:
Where is Benny now?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.250
On the street. A few months ago,

08:37.284 --> 08:39.119
he was released
from the psych hospital

08:39.152 --> 08:40.688
right here
on Randall's Island.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.689
Of all the psychos

08:41.722 --> 08:43.757
our victim could have set free,
why this one?

08:43.791 --> 08:46.193
She claimed his treatment
was a complete success.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.632
FIN:
Planning your next rape, Benny?

08:51.665 --> 08:52.866
Dr. H. completely rewired me.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.568
I don't even think that way
anymore.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.603
STABLER
Really?

08:55.636 --> 08:58.706
Now, isn't this your old
restraint of choice here?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.841
You don't have to broadcast it.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.143
I paid my debt,
and I'm registered.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.311
Seen your
therapist lately?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.613
I never missed
a session.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.047
Afraid this week's is canceled.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.215
Why?

09:08.248 --> 09:09.917
Somebody put her
in the hospital.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.051
What happened?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.185
You tell us.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.787
I would never hurt the doc.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.322
She's the reason why I'm out.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.724
Where is she?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.358
Why would you need
to know that?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.628
I'd like to send her flowers.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.229
She's like a mother to me.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.363
So tell me,

09:23.396 --> 09:25.633
why do you hate your mother?

09:25.666 --> 09:28.235
I told you,
it wasn't me.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.670
Where were you Sunday night?

09:29.703 --> 09:30.804
Home.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.072
Don't tell me. Alone.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.273
Yeah. So?

09:33.306 --> 09:35.042
Can somebody put you there?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.077
Yeah.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.780
Mr. Ankle Bracelet.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.915
MAN:
It's a pilot program.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.316
One of the conditions
of his release

09:43.350 --> 09:44.852
is that he not go out at night.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.353
So there's no way
that he could have

09:46.386 --> 09:47.420
gone out last
Sunday night?

09:47.454 --> 09:49.890
If he had so much as stepped out
onto the sidewalk,

09:49.923 --> 09:50.891
I'd have been notified.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.159
He's never broken curfew once.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.861
Really? How do you
know that for sure?

09:53.894 --> 09:54.795
We've got him on GPS.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.230
This system can track him
within six feet.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.100
So, You can tell us
where he is right now?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.970
See the moving dot?

10:03.003 --> 10:04.371
56th and Broadway.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.807
Two blocks from work,
on his way home.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.742
STABLER:
What are the red zones?

10:08.776 --> 10:09.877
Known areas of prostitution.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.144
Most of his victims
were hookers.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.145
Well, they're now off-limits.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.281
He's getting awful close
to a ho zone right now.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.316
What happens
if he takes a right here?

10:16.349 --> 10:19.119
Well, that would signal
an unauthorized departure.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.121
And I would be beeped
immediately on my PDA.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.756
Well, get ready.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.794
Nope. Resisted temptation again.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.729
And there's no way
of beating the system?

10:28.762 --> 10:29.830
It's foolproof.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.265
Although, every time
they build a better mousetrap,

10:32.299 --> 10:34.668
someone finds a way
to outsmart it.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.172
BENSON:
Looks like he's itching
to get out.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.274
This guy Benny's
climbing the walls.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.443
Okay, thanks.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.947
Munch just got the LUDs
from Dr. Heints' patient line.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.782
How'd we get those?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.383
Cragen talked her
into giving us the hour

10:50.417 --> 10:51.952
before the attack.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.220
Any calls from Benny?

10:53.253 --> 10:56.189
No, and none coming
from his building.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.324
It was a pay phone.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.726
In this neighborhood?

10:58.759 --> 11:00.928
No, 86th and Lex.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.395
Now, you got a subway
right down here,

11:02.429 --> 11:03.931
and two stops up
on the 6 train

11:03.964 --> 11:05.098
is the pay phone.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.433
But how'd he beat the monitor?

11:06.466 --> 11:07.768
The guy's in
electronics.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.473
I think he's also trying
to climb out the window.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.475
Just his cat.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.345
( meows )

11:18.378 --> 11:20.447
( loud beeping )

11:20.480 --> 11:22.716
Unauthorized departure.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.384
Cat must be a diversion.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.719
Fin, he's on the move.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.154
You see him
coming out back?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.156
I've got nothing back here.
It's dead.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.457
How the hell
did he get out?

11:30.490 --> 11:33.060
I don't know.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.497
Liv.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.767
Check out the cat.

11:43.771 --> 11:44.938
Benny's ankle bracelet.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.240
That son of a bitch
slipped his leash.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.246
Benny Ralsay pop up
on the radar yet?

11:53.280 --> 11:54.514
No, and we're
working blind here.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.183
We can't even get
into his apartment.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.350
We're still waiting
on a warrant.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.787
Maybe his employer
could steer us
in some direction.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.854
Yeah, the unemployment line.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.290
It turns out he was fired
yesterday after we left.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.859
All the coworkers revolted
when they found out who he was.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.995
Well, if he's smart,
he's halfway cross-
country by now.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.197
The next of kin is listed
as a mother in Pennsylvania.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.065
Authorities there
are watching her house.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.466
Tell them not to
hold their breath.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.803
We just subpoenaed the
visitor logs from Attica.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.470
Mom didn't visit him
once in eight years,

12:17.504 --> 12:18.806
nor did anyone else.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.340
Where are you
on the search warrant?

12:20.373 --> 12:22.009
Floundering in
unchartered waters.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.310
STABLER:
What is the problem?

12:23.343 --> 12:25.378
This guy violated
the conditions of his release.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.814
He served his full
prison sentence

12:26.847 --> 12:28.115
and was never on parole.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.983
Therefore, he was never subject

12:30.017 --> 12:32.285
to the Department
of Corrections' supervision.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.320
So who has jurisdiction?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.521
The Department
of Mental Health.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.124
But remember, this
is their first civil
commitment release.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.026
They have never had to
deal with enforcement.

12:39.059 --> 12:39.860
I'm telling you

12:39.893 --> 12:41.895
this guy is
the Duct Tape Rapist.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.931
His victim is
his own psychiatrist.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.867
More than enough for a warrant
if Benny was on parole.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.268
Legally, he is Joe Citizen.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.004
The standards for probable cause
are much higher.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.405
I need more.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.277
Our only road left is
his shrink-slash-victim.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.212
Get her to hand over his file.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.548
Might have trouble finding it.

13:01.581 --> 13:05.318
Just got word somebody
vandalized her office.

13:08.922 --> 13:12.192
STABLER:
First he attacks you
personally, now professionally.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.063
This is a vendetta.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.598
In your sessions
with Benny,

13:18.631 --> 13:21.134
has he been unusually
upset recently?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.937
I take all my patients
to painful places.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.472
None have lashed out
like this.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.607
STABLER:
This is empty.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.943
What was in here?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.211
( sighs )

13:31.244 --> 13:33.213
My session tapes
from the last week.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.515
Why would he take
all of them?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.919
They're sent out
for transcription.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.221
To ensure privacy,
they're-they're labeled

13:41.254 --> 13:42.555
by case number, not name.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.624
So whoever did this
would not know

13:44.657 --> 13:45.625
which tape was his.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.559
Dr. Heints, has Benny

13:46.593 --> 13:49.096
disclosed anything
incriminating lately?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.497
Look, he hasn't reoffended.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.100
Course you couldn't say
even if he had, right?

13:53.133 --> 13:56.036
Dust this. Boy, I tell you,
therapists and priests--

13:56.069 --> 13:58.271
always there to listen,
just not allowed

13:58.305 --> 13:59.439
to tell, huh?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.141
Benny is my biggest success.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.177
He had a new life, a good job,
a healthy relationship

14:04.211 --> 14:05.545
until you persecuted him.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.982
Who was this so-called
healthy relationship with?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.117
( sighs )

14:10.150 --> 14:11.418
STABLER:
Doctor, you want

14:11.451 --> 14:13.186
to clear him,
we need to find him.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.989
I only know her first name. Amy.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.258
Well, who else
would he go to?

14:19.927 --> 14:22.429
He was estranged
from his family,

14:22.462 --> 14:26.033
but I'd been encouraging him
to reconnect.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.300
He's an embarrassment
to the family.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.435
We want nothing
to do with him.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.469
He's your baby brother.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.571
If he had trouble,
seems like he'd come to you.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.539
Not after last time.

14:32.572 --> 14:36.309
I made myself
crystal clear:
lose my number.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.310
When was this?

14:37.344 --> 14:38.378
Couple of weeks ago.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.948
Said he needed to rebuild
his family support system.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.951
I don't know what talk show he's
watching, but I ain't buying.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.385
So, you don't think
he's changed?

14:45.418 --> 14:47.287
I got a wife
and three kids, all girls.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.488
I can't take
any chances.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.622
You at least catch up?

14:49.656 --> 14:51.358
Find out what's going on
in his life?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.359
New friends?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.094
Maybe a special lady?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.695
Yeah.
That was his big pitch.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.365
Said he was dating
a nice wholesome girl.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.632
Amy?

14:59.666 --> 15:00.968
Yeah. That was her name.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.502
I thought for sure
he was making that up.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.303
Why is that?

15:03.336 --> 15:06.974
Get this--
said she was a librarian.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.509
Here you are, Trishan.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.280
Benny and I just celebrated
our one-month anniversary.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.984
Uh, have you ever noticed, Amy,

15:17.017 --> 15:18.986
that Benny wears
an ankle bracelet?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.553
It's a little hard to miss.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.722
Oh, I know all about
his house arrest.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.624
And you didn't have
a problem with that?

15:24.657 --> 15:26.994
It's not his fault.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.428
BENSON:
Well, whose
fault is it?

15:28.461 --> 15:32.032
Benny had an addiction,
but it's under control now.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.300
Lady...
( clears throat )

15:33.333 --> 15:34.434
I gotta tell you,

15:34.467 --> 15:36.469
you are pretty damn
understanding.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.705
We have a whole section here
on that subject.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.440
You'd be surprised
how many people

15:40.473 --> 15:42.075
have a problem with gambling.

15:44.211 --> 15:47.047
Amy?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.315
( sighs )

15:48.348 --> 15:51.985
Your boyfriend raped
over 30 women.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.724
Why would you say something
so horrible?

15:57.757 --> 16:00.627
BENSON:
He told you that he was
from Albany, right?

16:03.330 --> 16:07.734
In the early '90s, Benny was
known as the Duct Tape Rapist.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.743
No.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.147
Amy, where is he?

16:23.150 --> 16:26.386
He's at my apartment.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.556
He said his sentence was over.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.428
It was the first time
he ever spent the night.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.398
( door opening )

16:38.431 --> 16:41.134
Ah, sweetie, you're early.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.402
I made your favorite.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.171
I wanted to surprise you.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.040
Trust me, Amy can't handle
any more surprises.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.341
Whatcha cookin'?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.581
That's a bad idea.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.349
Step away from
the knives.

16:56.383 --> 17:00.053
Step away
from the knives!

17:06.693 --> 17:09.062
( grunting )

17:13.100 --> 17:14.367
( grunts loudly )

17:16.369 --> 17:18.338
You're a creature
of habit, Benny.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.107
You might want
to change your MO.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.610
Benny, tell me something.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.112
How many times
have you gone out

17:25.145 --> 17:26.113
while the cat stayed in?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.247
Never.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.515
This is my first time.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.250
Right. Where are
the tapes you stole?

17:30.283 --> 17:31.118
I told you!

17:31.151 --> 17:33.520
I didn't break
into the doc's office.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.256
STABLER:
And you didn't attack her
the night before?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.525
I don't do that anymore.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.659
Oh, I believe you,

17:39.692 --> 17:41.428
but Amy doesn't.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.264
What did you tell her?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.699
BENSON:
Ah, just a few things
that you were obviously

17:46.733 --> 17:48.301
too bashful to mention.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.403
That made her want
to learn more.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.572
So, she went
through your suitcase.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.142
She doesn't remember
posing for these.

17:55.175 --> 17:55.942
Or giving you permission

17:55.975 --> 17:57.844
to take them
while she was sleeping.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.581
She looked so pretty.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.417
Well, she wasn't
when she found these. Uh...

18:04.451 --> 18:09.689
gloves, crowbar,
glass cutter...

18:09.722 --> 18:11.224
Oh, and look a-here,
it's our old friend,

18:11.258 --> 18:12.159
Mr. Duct Tape.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.726
What exactly were you doing
with these?

18:22.369 --> 18:25.238
Okay, I admit I
still think about it.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.641
It's-it's a
constant struggle,

18:28.675 --> 18:30.610
but the doc was
keeping me clean.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.346
Try again.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.749
I didn't buy them
until you started
hounding me.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.618
But I wasn't going
to use them, I swear.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.421
Benny, science has advanced
an awful lot since you went in.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.756
Now, all this stuff
is at our crime lab right now.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.792
If there's even one
microscopic wood fiber

18:45.825 --> 18:47.527
on this crowbar,
they can match it

18:47.560 --> 18:49.362
to the busted drawer
in her office.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.264
If the strip you bound
Dr. Heints with

18:51.298 --> 18:53.333
was the last off that roll,
we'll know it.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.667
I didn't do it!

18:54.701 --> 18:57.537
I wouldn't!
Don't you get it?!

18:57.570 --> 18:59.272
Dr. H was helping me.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.374
BENSON:
Then why
did you run?

19:01.408 --> 19:04.944
Because my life here was ruined,
thanks to you.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.547
STABLER:
Can you believe
this guy?

19:07.580 --> 19:10.550
It's our fault
he's a sick...

19:10.583 --> 19:11.684
We were way
off track, huh?

19:11.718 --> 19:12.819
( knocking )

19:12.852 --> 19:15.188
Yeah.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.325
( door opens )

19:18.358 --> 19:20.827
Mental Health Board
finally took a stand

19:20.860 --> 19:21.828
on the violations.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.830
We're shipping Benny
back to the state hospital.

19:23.863 --> 19:24.731
Screw civil commitment.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.932
We're putting this
guy back in prison.

19:25.965 --> 19:26.933
I'm afraid not.

19:26.966 --> 19:27.800
I just talked
to the lab.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.702
Nothing matches
Benny's tools or prints.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.970
So he must have worn gloves.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.104
Well, whoever broke in,
didn't.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.974
Prints were everywhere,
including on the locked drawer.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.175
Belong to a Robert Logan.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.945
I don't remember
that name from her
sex offender list.

19:38.978 --> 19:39.879
He's not a con.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.848
He's a second-year law student
from Hudson U.

19:41.881 --> 19:42.649
How do we have his prints?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.351
He clerked for the city
last summer.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.985
BENSON:
Well, Dr. Heints teaches
at Hudson U.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.588
Maybe she treats
some of her students there, too.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.590
His address is in the file.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.191
Pick him up.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.027
( tires squeal )

19:58.898 --> 19:59.999
What's going on?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.734
Bloody mess.
Suicide attempt.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.603
Oh, maybe not.
Female victim?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.472
Male. Some law student.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.873
Robert Logan.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.508
Yeah, that should be him
right there.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.245
BENSON:
He's a suspect in a rape.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.246
He needs to be taken

20:13.280 --> 20:14.247
to Bellevue prison ward.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.382
Liv.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.284
What the hell is
she doing here?

20:32.532 --> 20:35.001
When I got to Robert's
apartment, he was despondent.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.936
He'd locked himself
in the bathroom.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.406
I feared the worst,
immediately called 911.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.607
Well, what were you thinking

20:40.640 --> 20:42.809
making a house call after
what had just happened to you?

20:42.842 --> 20:43.943
He was a patient
in crisis.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.845
He's the one
who attacked you.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.450
( sighs ):
I suspected that.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.285
What?
What?

20:52.319 --> 20:56.289
The last time I saw him,
he had anger issues with me.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.858
Well, when was that?

20:58.891 --> 21:00.092
Friday.

21:00.126 --> 21:03.863
Doctor, it would've saved us
an awful lot of time and energy

21:03.896 --> 21:05.598
if you had told
us this before.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.999
I couldn't.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.001
Remember, I had
no memory of that night.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.003
My testimony would have
been based solely

21:11.037 --> 21:13.606
on privileged communication,
which is inadmissible.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.974
We have a very
resourceful ADA.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.709
She would've found
a way around it.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.345
It's fruit
of the poisoned tree.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.480
Without
your independent investigation,

21:20.513 --> 21:22.349
any half-decent defense attorney

21:22.382 --> 21:24.351
would've thrown
the entire case out.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.552
Well, you seem to have

21:25.585 --> 21:27.086
the whole thing figured out.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.656
Now, why exactly
was Robert angry with you?

21:29.689 --> 21:31.858
I told him
I needed to transition him

21:31.891 --> 21:33.326
to another therapist.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.527
Because he threatened you?

21:34.561 --> 21:35.928
No, because
I'd lost control.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.831
Because I took him too far
too quickly.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.000
He'd become obsessed with me.

21:41.033 --> 21:44.404
I thought it best
he have a male therapist.

21:44.437 --> 21:47.574
So obviously Robert didn't
handle the rejection too well.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.443
( chuckles wryly )

21:51.511 --> 21:52.679
Greta loves me.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.080
She's leaving her husband,
you know.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.114
To be with you?

21:55.147 --> 21:56.949
Yeah. In our sessions,
all we do is make love.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.685
Who initiated
this relationship?

21:58.718 --> 21:59.819
Greta.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.020
She was professional at first,

22:01.053 --> 22:04.090
and then she started dressing
seductively, just for me.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.958
How did you respond
to that?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.527
I had dreams about her
every night.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.596
I couldn't think
about anything else, you know?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.764
Why did you steal
her session tapes?

22:12.765 --> 22:14.667
So I could hear her voice.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.969
It hurts when I'm not with her.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.138
Where are the tapes now?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.007
Somebody stole them.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.509
I have to get them back

22:22.542 --> 22:24.744
because they prove
that she loves me.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.613
Really?
Yeah.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.648
Tell me about them.

22:29.649 --> 22:34.754
Well, uh... she wants me
to take my clothes off

22:34.787 --> 22:37.757
so we can take a bath together.

22:37.790 --> 22:41.394
She wants me
to suck on her breasts.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.430
Does she ask you to hurt her?

22:43.463 --> 22:44.897
No!

22:44.931 --> 22:46.633
Then why did you?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.535
Excuse me,
I would never hurt her.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.570
But what about the crack house?

22:50.603 --> 22:53.406
You called and told her
to meet you there.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.676
Tell me what happened.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.811
I can't remember. I-I...

22:58.845 --> 23:00.780
I lose chunks of time, you know.
I always have.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.949
That's why I started seeing her
in the first place.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.684
You have blackouts?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.419
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.688
You know, I go to sleep
and I wake up days later

23:08.721 --> 23:11.023
and sometimes...
sometimes it's in another town.

23:11.057 --> 23:11.791
Did you black out
on Sunday night?

23:11.824 --> 23:13.493
I just told you
I don't know.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.994
I don't... I don't know.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.630
What is the last thing
you do remember?

23:19.031 --> 23:21.000
( sighs )

23:21.033 --> 23:24.437
Greta breaking up with me.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.041
What happened?

23:34.681 --> 23:38.651
She just said she didn't want
to see me anymore.

23:38.685 --> 23:41.120
HUANG:
It's common for patients

23:41.153 --> 23:42.855
to fantasize
about their therapists.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.791
In psychiatry,
it's called transference.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.659
Around here,
we call it sexual assault.

23:46.693 --> 23:47.794
Robert doesn't
deny the attack.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.529
He just has no memory
of the details.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.930
Oh, bull.
Plus, he has a history

23:50.963 --> 23:53.900
of going into
psychogenic fugue states.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.068
Okay, I'll bite.
What's that?

23:56.102 --> 23:59.806
Dissociative episodes where
one loses days, even weeks.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.874
The patient is not aware
of the time that's lost

24:01.908 --> 24:03.943
nor has any memory of
what happened during it.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.912
Including a half-assed
suicide attempt?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.080
I read the report.
He sliced the wrong way.

24:08.114 --> 24:12.118
He sliced deep enough
to have the hospital
admit him.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.588
Look, this is obviously
a desperate attempt

24:15.622 --> 24:16.989
to get the doctor
back in his life.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.125
Or set up for a handy
insanity defense.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.860
In which case
we couldn't touch him.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.129
His attorney has
requested a 730 exam.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.764
I've asked our civil actions ADA

24:24.797 --> 24:26.599
to observe
the psychiatric evaluation

24:26.633 --> 24:28.835
and let me know if and when
he is fit to stand trial.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.604
Well, frankly, I don't
see that happening
any time soon.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.139
He may be crazy,

24:33.172 --> 24:35.174
but he was competent enough
to plan that crime.

24:35.207 --> 24:38.645
Okay, look, we'll dig
into his mental state
leading up to it.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.982
WOMAN:
Robert hasn't been
to class in weeks.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.884
MUNCH:
Is that a habit
with him?

24:44.917 --> 24:46.285
No, it only happened
once before.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.887
When?
Last year.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.857
He made Law Review,
but the pressure got to him.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.225
Day his article was due,
he disappeared.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.794
When did he come back?

24:54.827 --> 24:57.530
A week later,
thinking it was due day.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.833
He freaked when they told him
he wouldn't be published.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.670
I had to force him
to get out of bed and eat.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.071
So you two were dating?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.072
I tried.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.206
It seemed like
he needed me.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.808
He's so smart and cute.

25:08.841 --> 25:09.942
But troubled.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.210
He's an overachiever.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.311
He worked so hard

25:12.344 --> 25:14.947
he just didn't have
any energy left for, you know.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.215
He's impotent?

25:16.248 --> 25:18.217
I hoped he'd work through it
with that shrink,

25:18.250 --> 25:19.686
but she only made him worse.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.953
How so?

25:20.987 --> 25:23.022
Robert told me
to stay away from him

25:23.055 --> 25:24.223
because I was dirty.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.858
Where'd that
come from?

25:25.892 --> 25:28.260
I don't know,
but it wasn't just me.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.563
He cut off everyone.
I'm late.

25:30.597 --> 25:31.831
What about family?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.966
Maybe his sister, Christina.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.602
They were really close.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.140
WOMAN:
We've always been
so proud of him.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.274
He's a genius,
you know?

25:42.308 --> 25:44.143
He was going to be
the first person
in the family

25:44.176 --> 25:45.244
to really make
something of himself.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.580
That's an awful
lot of pressure.
Maybe it got to him.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.582
I'll tell you what got
to him, that quack.
Dr. Heints?

25:49.616 --> 25:50.449
Since he started
seeing her,

25:50.482 --> 25:51.884
he hasn't had
a thought of his own.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.152
You.
( groans )

25:53.185 --> 25:54.621
You, you better
come with me.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.756
Everything's always,
"Greta said this.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.290
Dr. H. said that."
( groans )

25:58.324 --> 25:59.826
Robert's obsessed
with her.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.260
Because she brainwashed him.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.763
Thanks to her,
he's a nonfunctioning mess.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.131
It got so serious,
I filed a complaint

26:05.164 --> 26:06.298
with the State Medical Board.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.900
Excuse me!
Excuse me, Dorothy.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.035
WOMAN:
Yeah?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.302
Dorothy, take care of him.
Okay.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.638
And what did they say?

26:11.671 --> 26:12.639
They contacted Robert,

26:12.672 --> 26:15.307
who said she was helping
him, so they dropped it.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.176
Then he tried to kill himself
over her.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.811
Over what he did
to her.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.212
What did he do to her?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.781
Your brother attacked
Dr. Heints.

26:21.814 --> 26:22.982
He put her
in a hospital.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.184
Robert's never been violent
his whole life.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.886
When was she attacked?
Sunday night.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.287
Then it couldn't have been him.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.823
Let me guess...

26:30.857 --> 26:32.992
He was with you that night.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.360
No, earlier, that morning.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.362
He was rambling
like a three-year-old.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.097
He didn't even know who I was.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.766
So I took him to St. John's

26:39.799 --> 26:42.334
where they admitted him
for 24-hour observation.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.237
Robert Logan was admitted
at 2:15 Sunday afternoon.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.372
Take a look
at his file?

26:46.405 --> 26:47.707
Sorry, it's...

26:47.740 --> 26:48.841
Confidential,
we know.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.110
MAN:
Hey, Nurse Lynch.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.378
Uh, no pun intended,

26:52.411 --> 26:54.113
but this place
is kind of a madhouse.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.983
Is there any chance that Logan
could've slipped out of here?

26:57.016 --> 26:58.384
Absolutely not.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.787
When someone's checked in
for observation,

27:00.820 --> 27:02.755
we do observe them,
quite regularly.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.890
BENSON:
So he was here

27:03.923 --> 27:04.891
the whole 24 hours?

27:04.924 --> 27:05.892
No...

27:05.925 --> 27:06.893
five.

27:06.926 --> 27:07.960
STABLER:
Wait a minute.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.762
You just said he
couldn't get out.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.163
I said
he couldn't sneak out.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.766
Robert checked in voluntarily
so he was free to leave.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.201
AMA, mind you.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.068
Against medical advice.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.904
Right, so you knew
he was dangerous.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.005
His behavior was erratic

27:19.038 --> 27:20.873
when he came in,
but he settled down.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.374
He wasn't suicidal or homicidal,

27:22.408 --> 27:24.176
so we couldn't stop him
from going.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.778
BENSON
You got a real
crack team here.

27:25.812 --> 27:29.415
After he left, your
patient tried to kill

27:29.448 --> 27:31.050
his own psychiatrist
and then himself.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.318
Dr. Heints?

27:32.351 --> 27:33.519
STABLER:
You know her?

27:33.552 --> 27:36.322
First couple hours Robert
was here he kept asking for her,

27:36.355 --> 27:37.857
but we couldn't reach her.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.191
And how did he
respond to that?

27:39.225 --> 27:40.827
Not well.
But when he settled down,

27:40.860 --> 27:42.762
he remembered
they had a session coming up.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.397
He said he'd be fine
as soon as he talked to her.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.837
Got a pretty solid motive:
she rejects him, he falls apart,

27:50.870 --> 27:52.171
begs to see her,
she doesn't come.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.372
Just hours before the attack,

27:53.405 --> 27:55.207
he tells witnesses
he's going to find her.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.075
You know,
he may be crazy,

27:56.108 --> 27:58.044
but he definitely knew
what he was doing

27:58.077 --> 27:59.111
when he lured her there.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.013
Who cares?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.716
BENSON:
Who the hell are you?

28:03.750 --> 28:05.384
Bettina Amador.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.486
You must be Benson and Stabler.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.421
CRAGEN:
The Civil Actions ADA

28:09.455 --> 28:11.190
Alex so highly
recommended.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.192
Ms. Amador here
was informing me

28:13.225 --> 28:15.461
Mr. Logan won't
be going to trial.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.998
Why?

28:19.031 --> 28:21.768
I just got the results
of his 730 exam.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.335
Powers-that-be
say he's not fit to proceed.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.404
Well, they're wrong.
Look, we just busted our hump

28:25.437 --> 28:26.906
getting this guy's
state of mind.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.040
It was premeditated.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.241
It's not relevant.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.911
Doesn't matter how sane he was
at the time of the attack,

28:31.944 --> 28:33.445
they're saying
he's looney tunes now.

28:33.479 --> 28:36.048
Which means he can't help
with his own defense.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.050
Well, I think that he's doing
a damn fine job.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.285
He's faking it.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.454
Okay. It's a long shot,

28:42.488 --> 28:44.223
but I can challenge
the findings.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.859
Might want to spruce up
a little bit for court.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.433
WOMAN:
I examined Mr. Logan

28:54.466 --> 28:58.871
and found him to be delusional
and highly agitated.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.339
His sense of reality is so poor,

29:00.372 --> 29:02.809
he doesn't understand
the charges against him.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.277
Agitated?

29:05.311 --> 29:08.047
He looks pretty calm
and collected to me, Dr. Baca.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.283
He's heavily medicated.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.284
Oh, he's high.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.153
Well, maybe that accounts
for his inability

29:14.186 --> 29:15.287
to help in his own defense.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.856
Objection.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.991
BACA:
Mr. Logan is so
entrenched in fantasy,

29:19.025 --> 29:20.359
he believes
his relationship

29:20.392 --> 29:23.996
with Dr. Heints was consensual.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.398
AMADOR:
Does Robert understand
assault is a crime?

29:26.432 --> 29:27.867
Yes.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.135
And does he
also understand

29:29.168 --> 29:31.137
he's being charged
with attempted rape?

29:31.170 --> 29:33.873
Yes, and he's deeply
upset about it.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.141
Upset?

29:35.174 --> 29:36.308
Doesn't that indicate remorse?

29:36.342 --> 29:37.977
Well, that's where
it gets complicated.

29:38.010 --> 29:41.413
Robert is devastated
that Dr. Heints was injured,

29:41.447 --> 29:43.349
but he maintains
that she controlled

29:43.382 --> 29:45.551
every sexual aspect
of the relationship.

29:45.584 --> 29:46.919
The victim was asking for it?

29:46.953 --> 29:48.187
Isn't that what they all say?

29:48.220 --> 29:49.521
Objection.
Withdrawn.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.790
Nothing further.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.725
Robert is extremely ill.

29:53.759 --> 29:56.528
I'm afraid the attack
came out of our intense therapy,

29:56.562 --> 29:58.464
which triggered
his emotional ability.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.333
Actually, his competency
at the time of the attack

30:01.367 --> 30:02.501
is not at issue here.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.336
But his premorbid
condition is.

30:04.370 --> 30:08.040
He suffers from well-documented
psychogenic fugue states.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.542
He was in one
when the incident occurred.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.244
Have you ever requested--
of anyone--

30:12.278 --> 30:14.246
to be hit over the head
with a blunt object,

30:14.280 --> 30:15.547
rendering you unconscious?
No.

30:15.581 --> 30:18.017
Are you in love
with Robert Logan?

30:21.587 --> 30:23.255
No.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.225
What? Why would she say that?

30:26.258 --> 30:28.160
AMADOR
Have you ever engaged

30:28.194 --> 30:30.196
in sexual intercourse
with him?

30:30.229 --> 30:31.998
HEINTS:
No, of course not.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.933
What? Why are you lying?

30:33.966 --> 30:35.034
Just tell them the truth.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.102
Tell them you love me.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.103
JUDGE:
Counselor.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.270
Robert, calm down.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.006
AMADOR:
Is it safe to say

30:40.039 --> 30:43.142
your patient was, and is,
sexually obsessed with you?

30:43.175 --> 30:44.276
Not with me.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.277
Then who?

30:45.311 --> 30:46.879
You're the one
he attacked.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.547
The fantasized relationship

30:48.580 --> 30:51.050
is projection
based on transference.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.284
In layman's terms?

30:52.318 --> 30:54.887
He has confused the pain

30:54.921 --> 30:56.355
of his severe
childhood abuse

30:56.388 --> 30:58.524
with the intimacy of
our corrective therapy.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.625
In his mind the two have melded,

30:59.658 --> 31:02.094
and he is desperate to believe
that we are in love.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.629
Oh, come on. We are!

31:03.662 --> 31:05.197
Why are you denying it?
Just tell them that...

31:05.231 --> 31:06.432
tell them you love me.
Why won't you do that?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.534
Just tell them you love me.
Counselor, control
your client.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.336
Come on.
Just tell them you love me.
( gavel pounding )

31:10.369 --> 31:11.370
Robert, please.
Robert, let her go.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.671
Please, calm down.
( gavel pounding )

31:12.704 --> 31:13.672
I am not who you think I am.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.007
Robert, I'm
your doctor.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.008
Please, just tell them.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.009
Just tell them you love me.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.010
Please restrain
this man!

31:18.044 --> 31:18.978
Just tell them you love me.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.679
Just... just tell them
you love me, please.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.315
Just tell them...
just tell them you love me.

31:23.349 --> 31:27.019
Just t-tell them.
Tell them. Tell them.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.654
You missed quite a circus.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.423
Robert had a complete
meltdown in court.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.025
For show or for real?

31:33.059 --> 31:33.825
It doesn't matter.

31:33.859 --> 31:35.427
Judge deemed him
unfit to proceed.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.695
CHRISTINA:
I'll tell you why.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.165
Because of what that woman
did to him.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.333
I want her arrested
for malpractice.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.003
Christina Logan,
this is Robert's sister.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.172
This is our captain,
Donald Cragen.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.406
I'm sorry, Miss Logan.

31:47.439 --> 31:50.209
This is a matter
for civil court, not criminal.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.211
Just listen.

31:52.244 --> 31:56.215
This is what your illustrious
Dr. Heints considers therapy.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.218
HEINTZ ( on tape ):
You know what my favorite time
of the day is, Robert?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.552
When you come out
of the bathtub.

32:00.586 --> 32:04.957
You're naked and clean
and you smell so good.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.192
I hold you close.

32:06.225 --> 32:09.996
You find my breast with your
lips, and you start to suckle.

32:10.029 --> 32:12.331
( turns off tape )
I can't listen anymore.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.332
It makes me sick.

32:13.365 --> 32:16.068
Where did you get this?

32:16.102 --> 32:18.370
I needed answers so
I searched Robert's apartment.

32:18.404 --> 32:21.307
You still think
she's the victim?

32:28.214 --> 32:29.381
BENSON:
You were screwing
your patient.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.382
I absolutely was not.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.418
HEINTS ( on tape ):
Think about me

32:32.451 --> 32:33.585
lying next to you in bed.

32:33.619 --> 32:38.324
I wrap my arms around you
and smother you with kisses.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.428
Insurance cover
a session like that?

32:42.461 --> 32:43.762
It is not what it sounds like.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.564
This is all part
of Robert's therapy.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.366
Sex therapy?

32:49.368 --> 32:51.537
I'm a professional.
This is my life's work.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.040
I would never be inappropriate
to a patient.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.375
I was reparenting him.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.477
Lady, I've got four kids.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.647
If I ever talked to one of them
like that, I'd arrest myself.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.481
I had to regress Robert

33:02.514 --> 33:04.416
to the point
where he was traumatized

33:04.450 --> 33:06.252
and give him the love
and affection

33:06.285 --> 33:08.154
he desperately needed,
but never got.

33:08.187 --> 33:09.688
And that just had
to involve breasts, huh?

33:09.721 --> 33:12.091
Yes.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.292
A baby bonds with his mother

33:13.325 --> 33:15.161
during breast-feeding.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.562
So you simulated
breast-feeding?

33:16.595 --> 33:17.563
No, not physically.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.730
I talked him through it.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.299
Like phone sex.

33:20.332 --> 33:24.236
There was never
any physical contact.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.140
I'd say the doctor has some
unresolved issues of her own.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.308
Maybe it's
countertransference.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.142
That's when
the therapist

33:30.176 --> 33:31.543
develops feelings
for the patient.

33:31.577 --> 33:32.611
It's not uncommon.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.380
Well, and when the therapist
has sex with a patient,

33:34.413 --> 33:35.247
that's Rape Three.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.648
And don't forget,
he assaulted her.

33:36.682 --> 33:37.649
She's the victim.

33:37.683 --> 33:38.717
Well, they're
both victims.

33:38.750 --> 33:39.718
And perps.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.220
We know Robert attacked her.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.289
The judge ruled him unfit,
so we can't touch him.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.224
The question is:
Did she have sex with him?

33:45.257 --> 33:47.093
I ran Robert's picture
past the junkies

33:47.126 --> 33:48.760
busted at the shooting gallery
that night.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.229
No one puts him there.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.230
What you got?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.564
You talk to the lookout?

33:52.598 --> 33:53.732
Mr. Bad-Ass is
in the wind.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.067
We're tracking him down.

33:55.101 --> 33:56.102
He's the guy we need.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.436
Everyone had to get past him.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.804
One of my informants just did.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.072
We're on it.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.507
You drive.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.409
Business never skips a beat.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.710
I'm out.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.712
Hey, man, I got
no business here, man.

34:06.745 --> 34:07.613
Then you're
loitering.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.481
Let's go. You're going
to come with us.

34:09.515 --> 34:10.816
Now, what do you want?

34:10.849 --> 34:12.751
This guy ever
cross your path?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.186
Yeah, I seen him before.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.421
MUNCH:
Night of the bust?

34:15.454 --> 34:16.855
No, couple weeks
before that.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.290
Doing what?

34:18.324 --> 34:19.125
Passing out needles.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.726
Showed up with one
of those do-gooders.

34:20.759 --> 34:21.860
What's his name?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.530
Her. Pain-in-the-ass woman
come around all the time,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.165
passing out flyers
for her clinic.

34:26.198 --> 34:27.199
Pushing methadone?

34:27.233 --> 34:28.834
Yeah. She gets a few,

34:28.867 --> 34:31.470
but they always
come home to Papi.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.573
Robert's sister, Christina,
works at a clinic.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.742
Christina,
that's the bitch's name.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.177
Was she there
that night?

34:38.210 --> 34:40.379
Yeah, it was kind of weird.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.514
She don't usually
come around after dark.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.584
It all makes sense now.

34:45.617 --> 34:46.752
You hated Dr. Heints.

34:46.785 --> 34:47.619
You tried to get
her fired.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.255
You tried to get
her license taken away.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.322
And when no one
would do anything,

34:50.356 --> 34:52.691
you decided to take it
into your own hands, huh?

34:52.724 --> 34:54.693
Who knows how many lives
she's screwed up.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.195
I doubt I'm her only enemy.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.230
You're the only one a witness
puts there that night.

34:58.264 --> 35:01.900
I'm there all the time
trying to help people.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.469
He mixed up the nights.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.404
He also plant your prints
on duct tape?

35:05.437 --> 35:06.472
The strip you used

35:06.505 --> 35:07.706
to bind her.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.309
STABLER:
Hmm?

35:10.342 --> 35:13.279
BENSON:
Come on, Christina.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.282
Tell us what happened.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.153
After I checked Robert
into the hospital,

35:21.187 --> 35:24.390
I went back to his apartment
and I found that... cassette.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.658
I went crazy when I heard it.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.660
I didn't know what to do.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.529
The things she was
doing to him--

35:30.562 --> 35:31.830
they were humiliating.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.302
I phoned her and told her
that I was a friend of Robert's,

35:36.335 --> 35:38.170
that he was in trouble
and to please come quick.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.471
Why the crack house?

35:39.505 --> 35:41.573
It was the lowest
place I know.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.809
I wanted her to fall
as far as Robert had.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.944
BENSON:
You sexually
assaulted her.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.379
No.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.647
Christina, there was trauma
to her genitals.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.183
That's because I kicked her
as hard as I could

35:51.217 --> 35:52.484
between her whoring legs.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.420
No matter what she did
to your brother, this was

35:54.453 --> 35:58.190
a pretty, um, extreme thing
to do, don't you think?

35:58.224 --> 36:01.460
I am all he has.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.895
I've been looking out for
him since he was seven,

36:03.929 --> 36:05.464
when Mother died of cancer.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.466
So, you were just
being a good sister.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.801
And if I have to go
to jail for that, fine...

36:10.902 --> 36:13.639
but she has to pay, too.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.643
Christina insists on pressing
charges against Dr. Heints.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.378
That's a tough week
for the doc.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.347
Brutally attacked,
life's work discredited.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.548
Now she's facing jail time.

36:22.581 --> 36:23.949
If she Freudian-slipped it
to him,

36:23.982 --> 36:26.452
she could end up serving
longer than her attacker.

36:26.485 --> 36:27.786
BENSON:
It's Christina's
first offense.

36:27.819 --> 36:28.954
She's looking
at a year, tops.

36:28.987 --> 36:29.888
Dr. H. could do up to four.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.757
STABLER:
Yeah, well,
Robert could be

36:31.790 --> 36:32.724
screwed up for life.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.393
He's turning out to be
the only pure victim

36:34.426 --> 36:35.394
in this whole thing.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.628
That's messed up.

36:36.662 --> 36:37.929
Well, so is this.
Christina just told us

36:37.963 --> 36:39.265
her mother died
of cancer, right?

36:39.298 --> 36:40.266
Yeah.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.700
I just Googled
the Logan family.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.802
Newspaper article
says that Victoria Logan

36:43.835 --> 36:45.404
died in a house fire in 1987.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.439
CRAGEN:
You sure you got
the right woman?

36:47.473 --> 36:49.375
"Her son, Robert, age seven,

36:49.408 --> 36:50.942
"was found wandering the streets

36:50.976 --> 36:52.744
with no memory
of what happened."

36:52.778 --> 36:54.780
Sounds like one of his
psychogenic fugue states.

36:54.813 --> 36:55.947
Losing your mother in a fire?

36:55.981 --> 36:57.516
That's probably
what started them.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.817
BENSON:
The fire was suspicious.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.387
Accelerant used
was lighter fluid.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.489
We thinking Robert set the fire?

37:04.556 --> 37:05.491
What fire?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.593
STABLER:
The one that killed
Robert's mother.

37:07.626 --> 37:08.827
What are you talking about?

37:08.860 --> 37:11.897
BENSON:
Their house burned down
when he was seven years old.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.633
It's a matter
of public record.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.002
You two never talked
about this?

37:17.035 --> 37:20.306
We spent a year on his mother

37:20.339 --> 37:22.708
and we never got
anywhere near this.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.344
Are you telling me he witnessed
the death of his mother?

37:25.377 --> 37:28.380
We believe that he
may have caused it.

37:28.414 --> 37:31.850
My God.

37:31.883 --> 37:35.421
If I'd known this, I would have
never taken him down that path.

37:35.454 --> 37:38.424
This completely
explains the attack.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.392
He-/////!s not the one
who attacked you.

37:40.426 --> 37:41.493
What?

37:41.527 --> 37:42.961
It was his sister

37:42.994 --> 37:44.663
Christina.

37:44.696 --> 37:45.931
Why?

37:45.964 --> 37:49.768
STABLER:
She felt you were responsible
for Robert's condition.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.905
Not for the reasons
that she thinks.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.975
I never touched him,
but I did push him too far.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.045
Listen to me.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.913
It's imperative someone
see him immediately,

38:01.947 --> 38:02.914
to talk him through this.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.683
You know that we can't
allow you to do that.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.084
No, of course not,
I'm the worst person

38:06.117 --> 38:07.052
at this point.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.654
What about the psychiatrist
you had see him?

38:08.687 --> 38:09.455
Dr. Huang.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.756
Did Robert respond
to him at all?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.558
He talked-- pretty
freely, actually.

38:12.591 --> 38:13.959
He's got to talk
to him again.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.428
Well, you got to give us
something that he can go on.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.999
Robert's mother was
a religious fanatic.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.702
She'd pull him out of bed
in the middle of the night

38:23.735 --> 38:25.371
and make him pray for his sins.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.905
You're seven years old.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.708
What sins does she
think you committed?

38:31.743 --> 38:36.682
I was born a boy and...
boys are dirty.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.351
Is that why she washes you?

38:39.385 --> 38:42.721
All the time.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.958
Does it hurt
when she washes you?

38:46.992 --> 38:50.729
Yes.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.732
She... She...

38:53.765 --> 38:56.768
She hits me down there.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.471
Your genitals.

38:59.505 --> 39:02.441
Yeah.

39:02.474 --> 39:06.077
She ties a string
around it, tight.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.781
Why?

39:09.815 --> 39:12.117
So it'll die and fall off.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.656
Why would she want
to castrate you?

39:17.689 --> 39:18.824
Sex is evil.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.393
That's what makes men bad.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.596
Robert, when
your mom died...

39:26.532 --> 39:28.099
how did it make you feel?

39:29.768 --> 39:31.937
I don't want to talk about it,
okay?

39:32.938 --> 39:33.905
I know it hurts.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.073
You've kept it in too long.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.642
Robert, you've got
to let it out.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.509
I can't.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.711
I'm right here.
Just take me through it.

39:39.745 --> 39:40.712
I'm not allowed.

39:40.746 --> 39:41.647
Who won't allow you?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.982
I don't want to talk
about it, okay? I can't.

39:44.015 --> 39:44.983
I can't! I can't!

39:45.016 --> 39:45.984
I don't...

39:46.017 --> 39:46.985
Don't do this to me!

39:47.018 --> 39:48.053
I don't want
to talk about it!

39:48.086 --> 39:49.020
Robert!

39:49.054 --> 39:50.789
You don't have to keep
punishing yourself.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.724
We can take away the pain,

39:52.758 --> 39:55.160
but we have to talk
about the fire.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.162
No, please... Please.

39:57.195 --> 40:00.432
Your mother is
in the house.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.000
Where are you?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.737
Where are you, Robert?

40:07.939 --> 40:10.509
Outside.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.178
Tell me
what's going on.

40:13.211 --> 40:16.047
I can hear her screaming.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.550
She can't get out.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.552
But you did get out--

40:20.586 --> 40:22.554
after you
set the fire.

40:22.588 --> 40:23.589
No, I didn't set the fire.

40:23.622 --> 40:24.590
Who did?

40:24.623 --> 40:25.591
She did.
Who's she?

40:25.624 --> 40:26.625
I can't tell.

40:26.658 --> 40:27.726
Why can't you tell?

40:27.759 --> 40:28.527
Because I promised.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.528
Who did you promise?

40:29.561 --> 40:30.996
Christina.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.806
It's okay, Robert.
You had to tell.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.941
Christina will understand.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.647
No, she won't.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.685
Why not?

40:55.854 --> 40:58.223
She did something bad
when she was little

40:58.256 --> 41:00.025
and my mother
sent her away.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.029
She wasn't allowed
to be there.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.500
But she came back that night.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.571
To save me.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.961
BENSON:
You killed your mother.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.229
My mother threw me out
when I was 14.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.265
I never saw her again.

41:40.298 --> 41:42.233
Why'd she kick you out?

41:42.267 --> 41:45.103
She didn't approve of
the boy I was seeing.

41:45.136 --> 41:48.173
We heard she didn't approve
of any boys at all.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.841
What was that about?

41:49.875 --> 41:51.743
One got me pregnant.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.712
Mother nearly beat me to death,

41:53.745 --> 41:56.114
and left me with relatives
in Minnesota.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.216
Told me never to come back.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.086
But you did come back.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.655
You were there
the night of the fire.

42:03.689 --> 42:04.956
You're mistaken.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.893
I came back after I read
about it in the paper.

42:07.926 --> 42:11.096
No one here even knew I existed.

42:11.129 --> 42:14.065
She told everyone
Robert was her only child.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.333
And we all know
what she did to him.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.003
Christina, we understand
why you killed her.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.272
We know the horrible things
she did to your brother.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.008
She wasn't abusing
my brother.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.113
She was abusing my son.

42:34.319 --> 42:37.723
She tore him out of my arms
the day he was born.

42:39.224 --> 42:42.694
He was punished for seven years
for my sins.

42:44.129 --> 42:47.933
When you came back for him,
you saw what she had done.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.301
You had to protect him.

43:00.946 --> 43:03.915
Wouldn't you do the same thing
for your son?
