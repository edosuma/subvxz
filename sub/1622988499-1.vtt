00:04.105 --> 00:07.608
(dynamic synthetic music)

00:12.046 --> 00:14.248
(Ruby panting)

00:14.282 --> 00:15.083
- This is Ruby.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.919
Ruby here, come in, come in.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.655
(Ruby panting)

00:21.689 --> 00:24.592
- [Jack] Ruby, Ruby, did
you get out of there?

00:24.592 --> 00:25.726
- No, I'm still inside.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.230
Where are you? What the
hell is going on here?

00:30.398 --> 00:33.801
- [Jack] Ruby, I made
it into the woods.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.369
I'm heading for the clearing.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.406
When I get to the jeeps, I
will get help for you, okay?

00:38.406 --> 00:41.375
And I'm going to come back
for you, all right? I swear.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.210
- Please, hurry.

00:43.377 --> 00:47.248
(creature growling)
(man screaming)

00:47.281 --> 00:48.082
Jack?

00:49.283 --> 00:50.851
Jack?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.186
Jack are you there?

00:52.186 --> 00:54.988
(Ruby whimpering)

00:56.690 --> 00:59.927
(Ruby whimpering)

00:59.927 --> 01:02.630
(Ruby whimpering)

01:13.807 --> 01:14.608
- Hey!

01:18.646 --> 01:20.047
(woman pants)

01:20.080 --> 01:22.082
Okay, we got to get out of here.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.283
It's coming.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.785
- What the hell
is going on here?

01:24.852 --> 01:26.254
- We just got five minutes
until the game ends,

01:26.287 --> 01:29.690
and then we just gotta survive
the next 24 hours, okay?

01:32.526 --> 01:35.563
(robot whirring)

01:35.563 --> 01:37.465
- [Robot] You are the last two.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.634
Who is going to win the
grand prize, ladies?

01:44.771 --> 01:47.675
(raptor growls)

01:47.675 --> 01:52.646
(raptor growls)
(woman screams)

01:53.281 --> 01:55.348
(Ruby pants)

02:02.923 --> 02:05.559
(raptor growls)

02:10.398 --> 02:13.033
(woman screams)

02:16.470 --> 02:19.072
(Ruby screams)

02:20.808 --> 02:23.211
(Ruby pants)

02:28.449 --> 02:29.250
- I won.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.321
I won this!

02:39.527 --> 02:41.695
- [Robot] Welcome to the hotel.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.964
- [Robot] We hope you
enjoyed your stay.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.666
- I won this, right?

02:45.733 --> 02:48.369
(robot putters)

02:51.004 --> 02:53.507
(T-Rex growls)

02:57.411 --> 02:58.612
You tricked me!

02:59.713 --> 03:02.316
(T-Rex roars)

03:02.350 --> 03:05.152
(Ruby screams)

03:05.152 --> 03:07.655
(T-Rex roars)

03:08.922 --> 03:12.393
(heavy suspenseful music)

03:18.666 --> 03:20.768
- I just want these
feelings to go away.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.508
- And how have you been
coping with everything lately?

03:30.244 --> 03:31.412
- I've been doing okay.

03:33.079 --> 03:33.881
Everything I can,

03:36.284 --> 03:37.485
But with him gone.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.758
I just didn't expect to be
in this situation at my age.

03:44.758 --> 03:45.559
You know?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.829
Nothing prepares you for this.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.868
And the worst thing is...

03:54.868 --> 03:57.305
Thinking about what I'm
going to do with finances.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.409
I'm a single mom of two kids,

04:03.644 --> 04:05.446
and I'm struggling
to support myself,

04:07.648 --> 04:09.750
let alone them at times.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.952
- Well, you know what
they say find a job

04:11.952 --> 04:13.987
that doesn't feel like a job.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.558
And, how about a
change of careers?

04:19.527 --> 04:22.129
- I don't have time
to learn a new skill.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.832
I was trying to build a
business before what happened.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.202
I just don't have the time
or the resources anymore.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.239
Let alone the energy.

04:37.845 --> 04:41.849
- You can't let this impact
your life, your future.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.151
You need to start thinking
about what makes you happy now,

04:44.183 --> 04:44.985
Sienna.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.088
I mean, haven't you got anyone

04:48.121 --> 04:50.891
that could help relieve
the stress of the kids?

04:52.693 --> 04:53.627
- It's just me.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.765
And I feel like everyone
just wants me to move on

04:57.765 --> 04:59.266
and get over it, at this point.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.569
- You'll never get
over him, Sienna.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.771
That is totally normal.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.708
But you will find a
way to live your life,

05:07.775 --> 05:09.677
and to live it with the memories

05:09.677 --> 05:11.244
of what you did have with him.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.285
- I just don't see that
happening anytime soon.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.155
And I guess...

05:25.125 --> 05:26.360
That's the worry.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.097
- [Jamie] Hey Jamie here,

05:30.130 --> 05:31.565
I can't get to the
phone right now.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.167
So, leave me a message and
I'll get back to you shortly.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.012
(Sienna sighs)

05:45.045 --> 05:47.815
(phone vibrates)

05:51.685 --> 05:52.586
- Hey Leigh-

05:52.586 --> 05:54.187
- [Leigh] Sienna, where are you?

05:54.187 --> 05:57.725
You were supposed to be back
more than half an hour ago.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.959
- Sorry, I'm heading back now.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.228
- [Leigh] No, look I told you,

06:01.294 --> 06:03.497
I had certain places
to be tonight.

06:03.497 --> 06:07.735
- I'm heading back
right now, sorry Leigh.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.236
- [Leigh] I will see you soon.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.946
(sullen piano music)

06:29.156 --> 06:32.192
(sullen piano music)

06:56.116 --> 06:59.119
(car door slams)

06:59.119 --> 07:01.354
- Kids, where's Leigh?

07:08.228 --> 07:09.429
Kids?

07:09.497 --> 07:11.231
- She left on a hot
date or something.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.604
- Of course she did.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.805
So the babysitter headed out,

07:17.805 --> 07:19.406
without waiting
for me to get home.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.813
Kids will one of you
get that for me, please.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.115
And if it's Leigh, no,
she's not getting paid.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.252
(phone rings)
No?

07:32.252 --> 07:33.320
(Peter groans)
- Mom!

07:34.522 --> 07:36.757
(phone rings)

07:36.790 --> 07:38.225
Hello.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.693
- [Games Master] Can I speak
to Sienna Woods, please?

07:39.693 --> 07:40.961
Your mother entered
our competition,

07:40.961 --> 07:43.096
and we'd like to discuss
her participating.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.433
- Let me just get her.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.039
You applied to a game show,
and they want you to go on it.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.710
(light piano music)

07:56.710 --> 07:58.078
- Hello?

07:58.078 --> 07:59.446
- [Games Master] Sienna Woods?

07:59.446 --> 08:00.848
- Speaking.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.215
- You applied for
our competition here

08:02.249 --> 08:03.316
at the Dinosaur Hotel.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.053
You were selected.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.855
And we would love to
offer you the opportunity

08:07.855 --> 08:09.657
to come down this week,
and to begin the challenge.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.490
- Wow.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.995
I mean, I applied for
a lot of things online,

08:15.028 --> 08:17.097
can you just tell me
a bit more about it?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.867
- [Games Master] I will
email you the details.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.936
Congratulations Sienna.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.505
You're one of the few selected.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.842
- Thank you.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.250
Looks like mommy's
going on a game show.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.922
(Maddie and Peter cheer)

08:41.922 --> 08:44.558
(Peter giggles)

08:47.294 --> 08:50.363
(dark ominous music)

09:02.242 --> 09:05.746
- [Sienna] You have been
selected out the masses

09:05.813 --> 09:09.516
for a brand new game show
at the Dinosaur Hotel.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.087
Where all your wildest
dreams, can come true.

09:15.288 --> 09:19.593
Where the impossible
is possible,

09:19.593 --> 09:23.797
and all bets are off in
the ultimate challenge.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.867
- What is the challenge?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.705
- It doesn't say,
maybe it's a surprise.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.374
So nobody can preplan
how to win it.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.276
Kind of like one of those
shows with the questions

09:36.276 --> 09:39.112
where you have to figure
it out in the moment.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.014
100,000 pounds,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.184
grand prize!

09:46.987 --> 09:47.788
Wow.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.760
- [Peter] Please, win it Mom.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.362
- I'll try my best.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.798
Christ, I've got to get
packing, and I've got

09:57.831 --> 10:01.568
to find somewhere to put
you two whilst I'm away.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.571
- [Maddie and Peter] Mom's
going on a game show!

10:04.571 --> 10:07.574
- Mom's going on a game show!

10:07.607 --> 10:09.209
Mom's going on a game show!

10:09.242 --> 10:10.944
(all laugh)

10:10.944 --> 10:15.448
Mom's going on a game show!
Mom's going on a game show!

10:15.482 --> 10:17.885
Mom's going on a game show!

10:17.885 --> 10:20.087
(door opens)

10:20.087 --> 10:22.890
(dinosaurs growl)

10:24.725 --> 10:26.359
- It's feeding time.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.731
- Come on, Leigh.

10:32.065 --> 10:32.866
Please!

10:34.634 --> 10:37.137
It's only for the weekend,
you've got to have them.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.440
This could be a huge
opportunity for me.

10:42.776 --> 10:43.711
And you know the
struggles I've been having

10:43.711 --> 10:45.312
with money recently.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.248
Help me out?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.649
Please.
- [Leigh] I would if I could,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.585
Sienna, but I am meeting
a new guy tonight.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.424
- I'll pay you double,
how about that?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.491
(Leigh groans)

10:58.525 --> 11:00.393
- [Leigh] I'm sorry, Sienna.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.329
I really do hope
you find someone.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.401
(Sienna sighs)

11:08.401 --> 11:10.704
- You have to go
Mom, for the money.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.671
- [Maddie] Yeah, you have.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.074
- I can't just leave you here.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.208
- Then we come.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.714
- No, it strictly
says no guests.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.786
- We'll stay in your room, you
won't even know we're there,

11:25.853 --> 11:26.653
promise!

11:36.363 --> 11:39.532
(quiet ominous music)

11:45.806 --> 11:48.475
(car door slams)

11:53.046 --> 11:55.648
(robot putters)

11:58.351 --> 11:59.552
Mom, how cool is that!

12:00.453 --> 12:01.721
- [Sienna] Yeah.

12:03.656 --> 12:07.427
- [Robot] Sienna Woods, and
who might your guests be?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.967
- My kids. I'm sorry.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.168
I couldn't find a
babysitter in time

12:15.202 --> 12:16.636
but they've agreed
to not be an issue.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.271
They'll stay in my
room at all times.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.273
- [Robot] Please make
yourself at home.

12:20.273 --> 12:25.278
Your bedroom is first door to
the right of the staircase.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.348
I shall come to get you for
the challenge this evening.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.487
- Wow. This place is huge!

13:07.520 --> 13:08.488
- Pretty nice, huh?

13:13.226 --> 13:15.762
- Oh hey, you must be
one of the contestants.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.497
- Oh, it's Sienna,
Nice to meet you.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.731
- [Zara] Zara.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.267
- How long have you been here?

13:20.267 --> 13:21.201
- Oh, I got here a
little while ago.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.871
Stunning house, Right?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.240
- Sure is.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.641
Exciting, right?

13:28.675 --> 13:31.011
I mean, do you think
this will be on TV?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.312
- Please say it does.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.714
My friends would
love to see me on TV.

13:34.747 --> 13:38.485
- Oh, I think it's meant
to go online, or something.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.687
So who are the little people?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.123
- My kids, I'm hoping
no one sees them,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.624
but I couldn't find
a babysitter in time

13:44.691 --> 13:45.893
at the last minute.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.594
So, they're not going
to be any trouble,

13:47.594 --> 13:50.430
but I'm thinking about
stashing them in my bedroom.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.798
- I'm sure you'll be fine.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.535
- Any idea what the
obstacles for the game, yet?

13:55.535 --> 13:58.705
- No idea, but rumor has
it, it's something big.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.875
I'll let you get settled in.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.877
- [Sienna] See you soon.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.239
- Wow. Looks like a prison cell.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.207
- [Sienna] Are you two sure
you're going to be okay in here

14:34.241 --> 14:35.475
for the weekend?

14:35.475 --> 14:38.345
- Sure, Mom, you go win
that cash, make us rich.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.447
- Oh, too cute.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.649
- Why is it called
the Dinosaur Hotel?

14:45.652 --> 14:46.853
- I have no idea.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.225
(Peter snickers)

14:58.765 --> 15:02.002
(Robot whirs)
(door opens)

15:02.035 --> 15:03.236
- [Robot] Miss Woods,

15:03.270 --> 15:06.673
You are expected
in the dining room.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.709
If you would like to
follow me, please.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.844
- Smash it, Mom.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.252
(robot putters)

15:23.790 --> 15:26.426
(robot putters)

15:37.270 --> 15:39.172
(door opens)

15:39.206 --> 15:41.208
- Please welcome, Miss Woods.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.481
- [Sienna] Hi.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.449
- [Laura and Woman] Hey.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.450
- [Zara] Hi.
- Hi.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.124
- When, did you arrive?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.392
- I just got here
over an hour ago, so.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.593
- Same, I'm Laura.

16:02.129 --> 16:02.929
- Zara.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.467
- [Robot] Welcome
to the competition.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.805
We are very excited you
have accepted our invitation

16:12.805 --> 16:15.608
to participate in our game show.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.645
Which will take place
in the next hour.

16:20.047 --> 16:24.451
You will be instructed by
myself, where to go and when.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.656
You will rely on one
another to help each other

16:29.689 --> 16:31.424
through the challenges.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.526
But, of course,

16:33.526 --> 16:38.531
only one of you will leave
the Dinosaur Hotel, a winner.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.602
- What are the
challenges, exactly?

16:43.936 --> 16:45.905
- [Robot] That will
remain a mystery

16:45.972 --> 16:48.808
until the grand unveiling.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.345
But only one of you will leave

16:52.345 --> 16:57.150
with the grand prize
of 100,000 pounds.

16:58.585 --> 17:02.789
All you have to do is
make it through the night,

17:02.855 --> 17:06.326
and get through each challenge.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.728
Contestants, please follow me.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.631
- Get through the night? Jesus.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.834
What are we expected to
be doing in this place?

17:37.390 --> 17:40.493
(dark ominous music)

18:08.555 --> 18:09.956
- What's going on?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.392
- [Robot] One moment.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.027
(siren blares)

18:17.430 --> 18:19.999
(group groans)

18:29.442 --> 18:32.044
(pterodactyl growls)

18:32.044 --> 18:34.314
(Sam gasps)

18:34.347 --> 18:37.517
(bold dramatic music)

18:39.686 --> 18:42.689
- Is this a hologram
or something?

18:42.722 --> 18:45.425
- [Robot] No, what
you see before you,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.360
truly stands and lives.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.129
- Is that thing real?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.267
- [Peter] Holy crap!

18:54.267 --> 18:57.670
- Peter, don't say that.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.971
- Maddie, come here!

19:01.040 --> 19:02.775
- I can't believe it!

19:04.277 --> 19:07.280
- It's amazing, I
cannot believe it!

19:10.049 --> 19:12.585
- [Maddie] Is that a dinosaur?

19:12.585 --> 19:13.920
- I don't know.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.791
- I have got to get a
photo of that thing.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.695
- [Robot] No photography
is permitted.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.131
Enjoy the experience
with your own eyes,

19:26.065 --> 19:27.234
but no photos.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.206
Welcome, to Dinosaur Hotel.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.609
We hope you enjoy
your stay with us.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.315
I do hope you enjoy your
experiences being here,

19:42.349 --> 19:43.550
contestants.

19:43.616 --> 19:47.687
Now, please place your
phones on the table.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.490
As we get closer
to the main event,

19:50.523 --> 19:53.960
we must begin putting
the rules in place.

19:53.960 --> 19:58.965
A signal blocker will be in
effect for the next 24 hours.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.603
Stopping those involved from
contacting the outside world.

20:03.636 --> 20:08.641
You are on your own and that
is how the game must be played.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.977
With no further assistance.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.885
- Mom said we have to stay
in the room, and we promised.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.753
- We promise a lot of things.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.188
- What if we mess this
up for her, though?

20:22.255 --> 20:25.825
- A little adventure
doesn't hurt anything.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.595
If we get asked, we can say,
"Yeah, we got lost trying

20:28.595 --> 20:30.162
to find the toilet."

20:30.162 --> 20:31.964
Come on, you want
to see it, too.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.107
(Sam sighs)

20:42.108 --> 20:45.512
(soft suspenseful music)

20:52.985 --> 20:55.988
(door knob clatters)

20:55.988 --> 20:58.358
(door opens)

21:10.437 --> 21:13.840
(soft suspenseful music)

21:15.107 --> 21:16.709
- [Robot] The
games will commence

21:16.709 --> 21:19.346
in approximately five minutes.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.613
Are you all ready?

21:21.914 --> 21:25.485
You will find devices
throughout the hotel grounds.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.154
That will help you win the game.

21:28.187 --> 21:33.092
Walkie-talkies are provided to
help you better communicate.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.895
There are only four available.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.064
Please use these, when found,

21:38.064 --> 21:40.867
to help yourself
survive the longest.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.168
- Survive?

21:42.201 --> 21:44.471
- [Robot] Using the
grounds and the hotel

21:44.471 --> 21:45.905
to bide your time.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.809
- What exactly is the game?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.713
- [Robot] Those that
you are up against,

21:53.713 --> 21:55.948
do not go down easily.

21:58.117 --> 22:02.321
As you explore, you may
come across helpful weapons.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.891
- How do you know that
only one of us is going

22:04.924 --> 22:06.125
to make it to the end?

22:06.125 --> 22:08.395
Like, what's going
to stop the others?

22:09.829 --> 22:12.865
- [Robot] Death will
stop the others.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.970
(heavy suspenseful music)

22:19.439 --> 22:20.707
- What is this?

22:20.773 --> 22:21.808
- You can't be serious.

22:21.841 --> 22:22.909
- I want to leave.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.513
- [Robot] Good
luck, contestants.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.280
The games have begun.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.923
(Sam mutters)

22:41.961 --> 22:44.597
(raptor growls)

22:49.001 --> 22:51.604
(raptor growls)

22:51.604 --> 22:53.973
(woman whimpers)

22:54.006 --> 22:56.275
(woman screams)

22:56.275 --> 22:59.446
(woman pants)

22:59.446 --> 23:00.613
(raptor growls)

23:00.647 --> 23:05.452
(door opens)
(women gasp)

23:07.153 --> 23:08.087
(raptor growls)

23:08.120 --> 23:09.155
- [Zara] Stay calm, stay calm.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.724
(Zara shushes)

23:12.892 --> 23:14.694
(Zara shushes)
Stay there, stay there.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.430
(woman whimpers)

23:19.799 --> 23:22.368
(Zara shushes)

23:24.737 --> 23:26.639
(raptor growls)

23:26.639 --> 23:27.440
- Run!

23:28.441 --> 23:31.544
(raptor growls)

23:31.611 --> 23:32.812
(Sienna screams)

23:32.845 --> 23:34.246
- [Zara] Help us!

23:38.084 --> 23:41.287
(woman pants)

23:41.287 --> 23:43.590
- What the hell is going on?

23:45.725 --> 23:47.293
- Where are you going?

23:47.293 --> 23:49.529
- I'm getting the
hell out of here!

23:49.562 --> 23:53.733
(heavy suspenseful music)

23:53.733 --> 23:55.935
- [Sienna] Where did it go?

23:58.204 --> 23:59.405
- Come on then!

24:00.439 --> 24:04.043
(intense suspenseful music)

24:07.880 --> 24:10.349
(birds chirp)

24:17.924 --> 24:20.727
(dinosaur growls)

24:21.761 --> 24:23.429
- [Peter] What was that?

24:23.496 --> 24:25.865
- [Maddie] Looks like
there are more than one.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.067
- [Peter] That one
didn't sound so friendly.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.281
- [Maddie] I think
we should go back.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.817
- [Peter] Come on, you
want to see it, right?

24:44.851 --> 24:46.385
- [Maddie] You want to see
it, I'm happy seeing it

24:46.385 --> 24:50.256
through the bedroom window,
thank you very much.

24:50.289 --> 24:55.294
- {Peter] We do it, then we
go back, it won't take long.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.065
- [Maddie] You can find it,
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.332
- [Peter] Maddie, Come on!

25:12.311 --> 25:14.080
- [Maddie] Come back!

25:26.292 --> 25:27.093
Come back!

25:29.696 --> 25:32.364
(Laura pants)

25:32.364 --> 25:33.766
- Hey, wait!

25:33.800 --> 25:35.001
- No! I'm getting in my car

25:35.034 --> 25:36.468
and I'm getting the
hell out of here!

25:36.535 --> 25:39.105
(T-Rex growls)

25:42.208 --> 25:45.411
(Zara screams)

25:45.444 --> 25:48.047
(Zara screams)

25:51.450 --> 25:54.086
(Laura screams)

25:56.689 --> 25:59.158
(T-Rex roars)

26:01.193 --> 26:04.597
(soft suspenseful music)

26:19.612 --> 26:23.015
(soft suspenseful music)

26:26.318 --> 26:28.487
- It fucking ate her!

26:28.520 --> 26:31.891
We need to leave now,
we're not safe here!

26:31.891 --> 26:33.726
- [Robot] Congratulations!

26:33.726 --> 26:36.763
As the first contestant
exits the game,

26:36.796 --> 26:39.799
your chances of winning
have now improved.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.635
- My kids.

26:42.669 --> 26:43.736
- What is it?

26:45.004 --> 26:46.005
- My kids...

26:48.574 --> 26:49.976
They're upstairs.

26:50.009 --> 26:53.212
- [Robot] Anyone who has
walked into the Dinosaur Hotel

26:53.212 --> 26:57.717
is just as much a part of the
competition as anyone else.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.451
- My kids aren't
part of this game.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.321
You leave them alone,
do you hear me?

27:04.123 --> 27:05.725
- [Robot] Your
children included.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.560
- They're not part of the deal.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.997
And they're not
part of the plan.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.799
I signed up to this, not them.

27:14.767 --> 27:15.567
Not them!

27:17.236 --> 27:20.072
- [Robot] I will repeat
myself once again.

27:20.106 --> 27:25.111
Those within the hotel must
participate in the challenge.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.880
(bat clatters)

27:28.748 --> 27:31.417
(robot putters)

27:34.253 --> 27:38.057
- What do you mean
your kids are upstairs?

27:38.090 --> 27:41.427
- My kids are upstairs, and
I'm going to go get them.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.295
- You can't go up there.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.530
Not with that thing
roaming around.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.233
- That thing was a T-Rex!

27:48.400 --> 27:50.870
Girls, that's one hell
of killing machine.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.005
Sienna, she's right, you
need to stay with us,

27:53.005 --> 27:55.708
and wait it out until
the coast is clear.

27:56.843 --> 28:00.079
- My kids are like
sitting ducks up there.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.547
I can't just sit here
and wait for them

28:01.613 --> 28:03.883
to open the doors so
that thing snaps them up.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.591
I've got to do something.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.928
(door opens)

28:26.405 --> 28:29.876
(soft suspenseful music)

28:38.684 --> 28:42.454
- Hello?
(walkie crackles)

28:42.454 --> 28:45.825
Can anyone hear me?
(walkie crackles)

28:45.892 --> 28:47.326
- [Zara] Sienna, wait!
- No, I'm going

28:47.326 --> 28:49.728
to get my kids, and we're going
to get the hell out of here.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.197
- Sam, You'll be fine here.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.564
Sienna, I'll come with you.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.233
- Stay here. I got this.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.272
(Sam sighs)

29:02.374 --> 29:05.144
(walkie crackles)

29:14.887 --> 29:16.188
- [Woman] Hello?

29:17.723 --> 29:19.325
Can anyone hear me?

29:21.327 --> 29:22.128
- Hello?

29:24.831 --> 29:25.965
- [Woman] I'm upstairs.

29:27.033 --> 29:27.834
- Oh God,

29:29.168 --> 29:30.202
you're alive.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.704
- [Woman] Wait a second.

29:32.704 --> 29:35.507
- What is it?

29:35.507 --> 29:37.910
(door opens)

29:39.411 --> 29:42.815
(soft suspenseful music)

29:49.956 --> 29:52.291
- Look, I've been waiting
upstairs in one of the bedrooms,

29:52.324 --> 29:54.126
which is gross, by the way.

29:55.694 --> 29:58.497
I think I just found
a way to escape.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.568
There's this door that seems
to lead to the car park.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.036
- No, stay put!

30:04.036 --> 30:05.972
One of the other girls went
out there, and a T-Rex came out

30:06.005 --> 30:08.207
of nowhere and got her.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.910
- Well, I either wait
up here like bait,

30:10.977 --> 30:13.079
or I take my chances
and I get out of here.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.649
Look, I've got my keys,
all I need to do is get

30:17.683 --> 30:21.253
to the bottom of the
stairs, and if I'm careful,

30:21.253 --> 30:23.990
I can make my way across to
my car and get out of here.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.194
I need your help, where are you?

30:28.194 --> 30:29.996
Please, help me.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.735
- [Zara] Right? Now, I
feel like a sitting duck.

30:36.735 --> 30:37.970
No, we need to do something,

30:38.004 --> 30:39.405
and we need to do
something soon.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.808
(Sam sighs)

30:45.444 --> 30:46.645
- Kids, listen!

30:47.846 --> 30:48.647
Kids?

30:50.116 --> 30:52.318
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

30:53.719 --> 30:55.454
- [Maddie] Come back!

31:01.994 --> 31:05.397
(slow suspenseful music)

31:11.003 --> 31:14.073
(pterodactyl growls)

31:17.043 --> 31:19.078
(Maddie gasps)

31:19.111 --> 31:22.481
(pterodactyl growls)

31:22.481 --> 31:24.050
- [Maddie] Help me!

31:27.920 --> 31:30.556
(birds chitter)

31:38.164 --> 31:41.567
(soft suspenseful music)

31:58.884 --> 32:01.687
- [Robot] You are currently
in the danger zone.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.656
I suggest if you wish to
continue playing the game,

32:04.690 --> 32:06.892
you return inside the building.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.927
- Oh, no. You tricked me
once into getting here.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.496
You're not going
to trick me again.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.665
- [Robot] It is not a
trick, just a suggestion.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.835
I'm allowed to suggest
hints to all players.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.907
(water dripping)

32:25.411 --> 32:28.814
(soft suspenseful music)

32:42.594 --> 32:45.597
(pterodactyl cries)

32:47.533 --> 32:50.536
(pterodactyl cries)

32:52.771 --> 32:54.473
- Is the coast clear?

32:59.445 --> 33:02.014
(woman panting)

33:07.186 --> 33:09.855
(woman panting)

33:11.390 --> 33:14.026
(woman panting)

33:22.468 --> 33:23.835
No!

33:23.835 --> 33:24.836
No, come on!

33:25.804 --> 33:26.605
Come on!

33:28.240 --> 33:29.408
What the hell?

33:30.842 --> 33:33.312
(woman cries)

33:35.614 --> 33:37.349
- [Robot] I warned you.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.750
- What did you do to my car?

33:39.685 --> 33:40.786
- [Robot] Cars are prohibited

33:40.852 --> 33:43.455
in helping a contestant
leave the game.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.424
As is any outside communication.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.926
- No, that was not
a part of the deal.

33:47.926 --> 33:49.695
- [Robot] A contestant,
once in the game,

33:49.728 --> 33:53.632
cannot leave the game until
the game has come to it's end.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.237
(robot putters)

33:59.405 --> 34:02.208
You have 16 hours
remaining, of the game.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.479
(T-Rex growls)

34:07.479 --> 34:08.647
- What was that?

34:08.647 --> 34:11.283
- [Robot] You are
within the danger zones.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.885
Its feeding time. I warned you.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.856
- Get back in the house!

34:17.889 --> 34:19.690
Get back in the house!

34:21.592 --> 34:24.096
(woman sighs)

34:25.164 --> 34:27.933
(woman whimpers)

34:29.568 --> 34:32.271
(woman whimpers)

34:34.473 --> 34:39.110
- [Sienna] Get back in the
house, get back in the house!

34:42.047 --> 34:44.516
(woman cries)

34:49.554 --> 34:51.690
(T-Rex growls)

34:51.723 --> 34:54.193
(woman cries)

35:01.933 --> 35:04.002
- Help me. Please help.

35:04.002 --> 35:07.639
(intense dramatic music)

35:07.673 --> 35:10.176
(woman cries)

35:12.344 --> 35:15.281
(soft eerie music)

35:22.521 --> 35:25.824
(lingering eerie music)

35:37.068 --> 35:39.571
- Do you think this is what
the robot was talking about

35:39.605 --> 35:41.106
to help us survive this?

35:41.106 --> 35:42.841
- [Sam] Pass it here.

35:45.444 --> 35:46.745
Hello? Hello?

35:47.879 --> 35:50.282
Could anyone offer us any help?

35:50.282 --> 35:53.952
Hello? We need some assistance.

35:55.954 --> 35:59.358
(soft suspenseful music)

36:04.596 --> 36:06.932
- Sienna, the cars don't work.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.035
We can't get out of the
game until it's over.

36:12.204 --> 36:13.672
I'm heading back to the house.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.910
(heavy suspenseful music)

36:18.910 --> 36:21.480
(door rattles)

36:23.148 --> 36:24.416
The door's locked.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.451
I can't get in.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.923
Sienna she's here.

36:34.726 --> 36:35.561
What should I do?

36:36.995 --> 36:38.196
- Tell her to go round the
back and meet me there.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.933
(frenzied suspenseful music)

36:45.804 --> 36:48.440
(T-Rex roars)

36:48.474 --> 36:51.310
(Maddie gasps)

36:51.377 --> 36:53.512
(T-Rex roars)
- Stay there.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.415
(woman shushes)

36:56.448 --> 36:59.050
(T-Rex growls)

37:02.888 --> 37:05.357
(T-Rex roars)

37:08.126 --> 37:10.762
(raptor growls)

37:15.634 --> 37:18.169
(raptor growls)

37:18.203 --> 37:21.239
(door shakes)
(Sam mutters)

37:21.239 --> 37:23.875
(raptor growls)

37:26.077 --> 37:27.078
- It's back.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.517
- Please protect my daughter.

37:32.518 --> 37:33.319
Please.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.191
(T-Rex growls)

37:43.194 --> 37:45.196
- Go, go round back
quickly, quickly.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.999
As fast as you can,
fast as you can.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.001
Fast as you can.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.471
(woman cries)

37:54.673 --> 37:57.409
(woman whimpers)

37:58.444 --> 38:01.447
(woman cries)

38:01.480 --> 38:04.115
(woman screams)

38:05.917 --> 38:07.853
- Maddie the stairwell!

38:08.687 --> 38:09.855
Meet me there!

38:13.425 --> 38:16.828
(intense dramatic music)

38:17.763 --> 38:18.997
Maddie, Maddie!

38:20.366 --> 38:21.600
Maddie come on!

38:24.202 --> 38:27.673
(Maddie screams)

38:27.706 --> 38:30.308
(alarm blares)

38:31.677 --> 38:32.478
Run!

38:32.511 --> 38:33.311
Run!

38:34.245 --> 38:36.948
(raptor growls)

38:40.352 --> 38:41.653
(door opens)

38:41.687 --> 38:44.255
(raptor roars)

38:48.494 --> 38:51.129
(raptor growls)

38:54.966 --> 38:57.569
(raptor roars)

38:59.270 --> 39:01.873
(raptor growls)

39:02.874 --> 39:05.511
(raptor growls)

39:22.160 --> 39:24.730
(raptor roars)

39:32.003 --> 39:35.641
(intense suspenseful music)

39:51.457 --> 39:54.092
(gun cocks)

39:54.125 --> 39:56.762
(raptor growls)

40:01.166 --> 40:01.967
- Hey!

40:02.868 --> 40:04.736
(raptor growls)

40:04.770 --> 40:09.775
(gun fires)
(raptor growls)

40:14.312 --> 40:16.915
We need to think how we're
going to get out of here.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.350
- You can't, it's a game.

40:20.285 --> 40:21.352
We play to the finish.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.989
- But there must be
a way out of here.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.191
I mean, surely we can just
walk through front gate.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.694
- We're locked in. The
only way out is by foot,

40:28.727 --> 40:30.395
and it's a killing
zone out there.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.999
- How did they even
get the things in here?

40:33.999 --> 40:37.335
Like, come on. Surely it's a
fucking hologram or something.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.638
- It's exactly what we
think it is. It is real.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.510
And the sooner we
realize and accept that.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.411
The better chance
we have of survival.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.215
There's only us left now.

40:51.683 --> 40:54.486
And going by the time we have
approximately six hours left

40:54.520 --> 40:55.487
until sunrise.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.590
Then it's all finally over.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.092
- That thing, the robot.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.128
That made a point of
saying only one of us

41:03.161 --> 41:04.563
will make the finale.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.566
- What's to say we all
can't make the finale?

41:07.566 --> 41:08.734
We can do this, surely.

41:12.037 --> 41:14.806
Maddie, where did you
last see your brother?

41:14.806 --> 41:17.843
- He was out in the woods,
looking for the dinosaur.

41:17.876 --> 41:21.412
And he thought it was cool so
he wanted to see it up close.

41:21.446 --> 41:23.048
- What kind of dinosaur was it?

41:23.048 --> 41:26.184
- [Maddie] The one
you all saw earlier.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.586
- [Sienna] Did it look scary?

41:27.653 --> 41:29.087
- [Maddie] No.

41:29.087 --> 41:29.888
- Okay.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.025
Okay, how long were
you in the woods for?

41:34.092 --> 41:37.128
- A while, but I got
scared and I came back.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.531
- Scared? What happened?

41:39.531 --> 41:43.368
- We kept hearing noises like
something was following us.

41:43.401 --> 41:47.238
- A Raptor. That's what
followed you back here.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.854
- I need a minute.

42:09.561 --> 42:12.631
(sullen piano music)

42:25.844 --> 42:28.647
(bottle clatters)

42:28.647 --> 42:31.249
(gun clatters)

42:32.217 --> 42:33.885
- What you thinking?

42:36.154 --> 42:38.189
- I've got to get my boy.

42:40.726 --> 42:44.362
It's been too long, I can't
wait for him to get back.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.697
- You can't go out there.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.236
- Your gun.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.906
Give it to me!

42:54.973 --> 42:56.642
- Sienna, it's not
safe out there,

42:56.642 --> 42:58.243
especially when it's dark.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.446
Them woods are going
to be like a maze.

43:01.446 --> 43:03.048
You might not find
your way back.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.852
- You look after
my girl, all right?

43:06.885 --> 43:08.286
And no matter what happens,

43:08.286 --> 43:10.689
you do not let her leave
this place until I come back.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.892
- Yeah, and what if
you don't come back?

43:16.762 --> 43:18.329
- I will come back.

43:19.998 --> 43:21.166
- No, don't go.

43:22.734 --> 43:23.601
- Oh, Maddie.

43:24.870 --> 43:26.672
Honey, you've got
nothing to worry about.

43:26.672 --> 43:29.474
Okay? It's going to be okay.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.810
But you brother has
been out in the woods

43:31.843 --> 43:33.611
for a few hours now
and he hasn't managed

43:33.611 --> 43:34.713
to find his way back.

43:36.114 --> 43:37.949
I'm just going to go out there,
find him and bring him back.

43:38.016 --> 43:39.084
That's all. Okay?

43:44.255 --> 43:46.357
No more tears, it's all right.

43:48.526 --> 43:49.995
- What if I lose you?

43:51.797 --> 43:54.599
- You're never going to lose
me. I'm not going anywhere.

43:59.370 --> 44:01.439
- But what about
what happened to Dad?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.642
- This is nothing like
what happened to Dad.

44:04.676 --> 44:06.912
I'm never, ever going
to leave your side.

44:07.846 --> 44:09.848
You can't compare this to Dad,

44:09.881 --> 44:11.917
nothing could have stopped
what happened to him.

44:11.917 --> 44:15.453
But I can prevent us
from losing this game.

44:15.486 --> 44:16.888
I just need you to be
stronger than ever,

44:16.888 --> 44:18.189
and we'll get through this.

44:19.590 --> 44:24.129
So please, be a brave
girl. Just stay with Zara.

44:24.763 --> 44:25.330
Do as she says.

44:26.798 --> 44:31.803
And I'll be in no time, okay?

44:33.204 --> 44:36.274
(somber piano music)

44:46.451 --> 44:47.252
All right.

44:47.285 --> 44:48.653
I'll scout in the woods.

44:48.653 --> 44:49.755
I'll be back soon.

44:51.189 --> 44:53.725
- We'll stay close to the
door to let you back in.

44:53.725 --> 44:55.927
- Just be careful, okay?

44:55.961 --> 44:57.295
- I will, don't worry.

45:00.231 --> 45:01.833
I'll see you soon.

45:01.867 --> 45:03.334
- See you soon.

45:03.368 --> 45:04.870
- Don't forget this.

45:08.006 --> 45:09.440
Keep us updated, okay?

45:26.925 --> 45:29.995
(dark ominous music)

45:45.676 --> 45:48.313
(birds chatter)

46:13.238 --> 46:14.505
- Try to stop
worrying about her.

46:14.572 --> 46:16.241
I think she's going to be fine.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.209
Can you sit down?

46:18.209 --> 46:19.010
- Sam.

46:22.747 --> 46:25.650
How can you say that? How
can you be so confident?

46:25.683 --> 46:27.052
- Well, she has a gun.

46:27.052 --> 46:28.753
She's got some more protection
than the others had.

46:28.753 --> 46:30.956
- Wow. And if that
huge T-Rex comes back?

46:30.956 --> 46:33.591
What, that's going to be
held off by a fucking rifle?

46:38.129 --> 46:40.798
I'm sorry Sam, but
you have been here.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.368
The whole thing is a
complete setup. It's a trap.

46:44.369 --> 46:46.071
Nothing is what it seems to be.

46:47.238 --> 46:49.307
We need to remember that.

46:50.808 --> 46:53.344
(bird chatter)

46:56.915 --> 47:00.685
(lingering suspenseful music)

47:02.053 --> 47:04.455
(door opens)

47:05.690 --> 47:08.159
(door closes)

47:09.895 --> 47:12.297
(Zara sighs)

47:14.665 --> 47:16.868
(loud crash)

47:16.935 --> 47:18.236
- What was that?

47:20.105 --> 47:20.906
- Stay here!

47:22.107 --> 47:23.108
- Can't be another one
of those things, surely.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.976
How would it get in?

47:25.010 --> 47:26.444
- Just stay here.

47:37.455 --> 47:39.824
(Zara gasps)

47:42.928 --> 47:46.731
(lingering suspenseful music)

48:06.117 --> 48:08.519
(wind blows)

48:27.872 --> 48:31.276
(soft suspenseful music)

48:42.954 --> 48:46.357
(soft suspenseful music)

48:50.128 --> 48:51.529
- [Sienna] Peter!

48:53.831 --> 48:54.632
Peter!

49:04.909 --> 49:08.313
(soft suspenseful music)

49:13.651 --> 49:17.055
(soft suspenseful music)

49:48.486 --> 49:50.755
(door clicks)
(door chimes)

49:50.755 --> 49:53.158
(door opens)

49:54.725 --> 49:57.795
(dark ominous music)

50:15.646 --> 50:19.217
- [Maddie] Why did all
the doors just open?

50:20.685 --> 50:23.321
(raptor growls)

50:24.389 --> 50:26.391
(raptor roars)

50:26.391 --> 50:28.759
(intense suspenseful music)

50:28.759 --> 50:31.396
(raptor growls)

50:36.867 --> 50:39.137
(raptor roars)

50:39.170 --> 50:40.105
- Run!

50:40.105 --> 50:43.708
(intense suspenseful music)

51:04.695 --> 51:08.333
(water rushes)
(water drips)

51:08.366 --> 51:11.536
(eerie ominous music)

51:19.043 --> 51:19.844
- Peter!

51:26.417 --> 51:27.185
Peter!

51:35.293 --> 51:37.195
- [Peter] Mom, I'm lost!

51:37.195 --> 51:39.096
- Peter, where are you?

51:40.631 --> 51:42.032
I can't find you!

51:43.368 --> 51:45.870
- [Peter] Follow my voice, Mom!

51:47.572 --> 51:48.373
Mom!

51:55.246 --> 51:58.449
- Come in, come in,
can anyone here me?

51:59.950 --> 52:01.486
- Yes, we're here.

52:01.486 --> 52:02.287
- Mom.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.561
- Thank goodness for that.

52:18.203 --> 52:22.507
(door shakes)
(raptor growls)

52:22.573 --> 52:27.545
(raptor roars)
(door opens)

52:29.514 --> 52:32.149
(raptor growls)

52:35.653 --> 52:37.688
(raptor growls)

52:37.722 --> 52:40.325
(raptor roars)

52:43.561 --> 52:46.197
(raptor growls)

52:53.471 --> 52:56.006
(raptor roars)

53:00.144 --> 53:02.647
(raptor roars)

53:09.887 --> 53:11.289
- Maddie! Maddie!

53:14.725 --> 53:17.528
(walkie crackles)

53:18.929 --> 53:20.565
(raptor roars)

53:20.565 --> 53:25.570
- [Sienna] Come in, anyone!
(raptor growls)

53:31.442 --> 53:36.447
(soft suspenseful music)
(raptor growls)

53:39.216 --> 53:41.852
(raptor growls)

53:48.793 --> 53:51.429
(raptor growls)

53:54.765 --> 53:57.402
(raptor growls)

54:02.006 --> 54:04.642
(raptor growls)

54:05.710 --> 54:08.446
(raptor roars)

54:08.446 --> 54:11.849
- Maddie, you've
got to keep moving.

54:11.882 --> 54:12.683
- No.

54:15.453 --> 54:19.390
- We've got to get out of
here or it will find us.

54:19.390 --> 54:20.391
Okay?

54:20.391 --> 54:22.927
(raptor roars)

54:22.927 --> 54:26.964
I promise I won't let
anything bad happen to you.

54:27.965 --> 54:28.766
Okay?

54:31.235 --> 54:33.704
That door over there,

54:33.771 --> 54:36.607
you've got to get to it, and
get through to the next room.

54:36.641 --> 54:39.209
(raptor roars)

54:40.345 --> 54:42.813
You go first, and
I'll cover you.

54:44.081 --> 54:44.949
- I'm scared.

54:47.151 --> 54:49.119
- I'll distract
it, if it sees you.

54:51.121 --> 54:51.922
Okay?

54:52.757 --> 54:54.325
And you don't stop.

54:55.693 --> 54:58.963
You get to that door and
then you keep moving.

54:58.963 --> 55:01.432
(raptor roars)

55:04.469 --> 55:07.104
(raptor growls)

55:09.407 --> 55:13.210
(lingering suspenseful music)

55:14.645 --> 55:17.247
(raptor roars)

55:21.185 --> 55:22.387
(drool oozes)

55:22.387 --> 55:25.055
(raptor growls)

55:34.832 --> 55:37.835
(Sam screams)

55:37.835 --> 55:40.471
(raptor growls)

55:41.639 --> 55:42.707
- [Sienna] Peter?

55:42.773 --> 55:45.810
(Sienna gasps)
Peter!

55:51.015 --> 55:52.016
I found you.

55:55.252 --> 55:56.554
(Maddie yelps)

55:56.554 --> 55:59.356
(Maddie screams)

55:59.356 --> 56:02.026
(Maddie screams)

56:04.695 --> 56:07.331
(raptor growls)

56:08.433 --> 56:12.069
(intense suspenseful music)

56:14.204 --> 56:16.841
(raptor growls)

56:20.244 --> 56:23.481
(door rattles)

56:23.514 --> 56:26.684
(raptor growls)

56:26.684 --> 56:29.687
(raptor roars)

56:29.687 --> 56:32.690
(cupboard clatters)

56:42.967 --> 56:44.034
(cupboard squeaks)

56:44.034 --> 56:44.835
- No!

56:48.005 --> 56:50.641
(raptor growls)

56:53.043 --> 56:58.048
(Maddie screams)
(raptor roars)

57:01.486 --> 57:03.488
- I'm sorry I ran off.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.456
- It's fine, it's fine.

57:05.456 --> 57:07.625
You're back with me now,
and that's all that matters.

57:07.692 --> 57:08.893
We just got to get
back to the house,

57:08.926 --> 57:11.028
and wait for this
all to be over.

57:13.564 --> 57:17.001
- I got lost. I couldn't
find the way back.

57:17.001 --> 57:19.870
- I think I figured out
the way back, all right?

57:21.405 --> 57:22.807
- Thought this was a game?

57:24.441 --> 57:26.043
- It is.

57:26.076 --> 57:28.813
It's some twisted game
of life and death.

57:28.846 --> 57:29.647
Let's go.

57:39.490 --> 57:40.691
- Mom?

57:40.725 --> 57:42.226
- [Sienna] Maddie,
can you put Sam on?

57:42.226 --> 57:44.028
- She's gone a dinosaur ate her.

57:44.028 --> 57:45.963
- [Sienna] What do
you mean she's gone,

57:45.963 --> 57:47.965
What happened? You
were safe inside.

57:47.965 --> 57:51.468
- One of the dinosaurs
came in and it was one

57:51.536 --> 57:53.470
of the shorter ones
and it got her.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.374
- [Sienna] Is Zara with you?

57:57.374 --> 57:58.776
- She's upstairs.

57:58.776 --> 58:00.645
- [Sienna] Okay, and
where are you right now?

58:00.645 --> 58:02.412
- I'm hiding in a cupboard,

58:02.446 --> 58:04.849
but it's out there
waiting for me.

58:04.882 --> 58:06.283
- [Sienna] Right,
okay, stay there.

58:06.283 --> 58:09.053
I'm coming in to get
you. I have Peter.

58:09.053 --> 58:10.454
I'll be right with you, okay?

58:11.522 --> 58:13.558
- I think it's safe now.

58:13.591 --> 58:15.192
- [Sienna] Just stay put.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.828
- Be careful, Mom.

58:17.895 --> 58:20.665
- [Sienna] I will do. Love
you, I'll be right there.

58:20.731 --> 58:22.132
- I love you too.

58:24.068 --> 58:26.270
(heavy ominous music)

58:26.336 --> 58:28.673
- [Zara] Some good choices
in the mix this time.

58:30.641 --> 58:33.177
(siren blares)

58:33.177 --> 58:35.345
Another one down?

58:35.345 --> 58:39.149
- [Robot] Contestant
Samantha has lost her life.

58:39.216 --> 58:40.651
- Aw...
Oh!

58:40.685 --> 58:43.120
Does that mean we get to
crown the winner now, then?

58:44.722 --> 58:46.657
- There's still three left.

58:46.657 --> 58:48.525
- And you want to make
the last three fight

58:48.525 --> 58:49.960
it out amongst their selves.

58:49.994 --> 58:53.363
Oh, you're nasty...

58:53.363 --> 58:54.198
and I love it.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.401
- You did say they'd
want to reach the finals.

58:57.401 --> 58:59.003
You were right.

58:59.003 --> 59:00.404
- I know.

59:00.404 --> 59:03.073
Christ, I didn't think
it would be Laura.

59:03.107 --> 59:05.375
She was the first one
out, so I win this one.

59:06.577 --> 59:09.714
- Not just yet,
still three to go.

59:09.714 --> 59:10.615
Place your bets.

59:13.684 --> 59:15.720
- I think the mom will cave.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.888
Saving her kids in
a mighty show down.

59:18.756 --> 59:21.959
Now the boy he's got guts.

59:21.992 --> 59:23.093
He's our winner.

59:23.127 --> 59:23.928
You?

59:25.495 --> 59:26.797
- I think the mom will win.

59:28.165 --> 59:31.001
She won't want to lose
her life, or lose.

59:31.001 --> 59:33.537
- Never doubt a mother's love.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.072
- It was good plan, by the way.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.874
Leaving them back
there on their own.

59:36.907 --> 59:38.976
- And good plan to you,
for opening all the doors

59:39.009 --> 59:40.244
to this place, cheeky.

59:42.279 --> 59:44.414
- Just wanted to spice
things up a little.

59:45.716 --> 59:47.451
- Well I thought, when
I separate from them

59:47.484 --> 59:49.687
it might up the
stakes a little bit.

59:49.687 --> 59:51.488
Make me even more
unquestionable.

59:52.923 --> 59:55.125
- Do you think they have
their suspicions about you?

59:58.228 --> 1:00:01.031
- Maybe Sam, she
questioned me to death

1:00:01.065 --> 1:00:04.168
in the kitchen early about
what I knew about the game.

1:00:04.201 --> 1:00:05.602
I had to make it believable.

1:00:06.971 --> 1:00:10.474
- Get back down there
and get the game going.

1:00:10.474 --> 1:00:12.209
We've only got an
hour til sunrise.

1:00:13.110 --> 1:00:14.511
Make it good.

1:00:14.544 --> 1:00:15.545
- Of course.

1:00:26.724 --> 1:00:29.193
(water drips)

1:00:36.233 --> 1:00:37.534
(raptor growls)

1:00:37.567 --> 1:00:40.771
(intense suspenseful music)

1:00:40.805 --> 1:00:43.573
(Sienna screams)

1:00:43.573 --> 1:00:48.212
(Sienna screams)
(raptor growls)

1:00:48.245 --> 1:00:49.747
(Sienna screams)

1:00:49.747 --> 1:00:54.551
(Sienna screams)
(raptor roars)

1:00:54.584 --> 1:00:57.755
(Sienna screams)

1:00:57.755 --> 1:01:00.290
(raptor roars)

1:01:02.359 --> 1:01:03.560
(raptor growls)

1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:06.330
(Sienna screams)

1:01:08.165 --> 1:01:10.801
(raptor growls)

1:01:12.036 --> 1:01:14.638
(Sienna screams)

1:01:14.671 --> 1:01:18.909
(Sienna screams)
(raptor growls)

1:01:18.976 --> 1:01:23.948
(raptor roars)
(Sienna screams)

1:01:24.681 --> 1:01:25.950
(Sienna screams)

1:01:26.016 --> 1:01:29.486
(frenzied dramatic music)

1:01:33.123 --> 1:01:37.561
(gun fires)
(raptor roars)

1:01:37.594 --> 1:01:40.364
(Sienna screams)

1:01:43.133 --> 1:01:45.836
(cupboard opens)

1:01:55.045 --> 1:01:57.047
- Hey, hey, come with me.

1:01:58.248 --> 1:02:00.317
- Mommy said I have
to stay hidden,

1:02:00.317 --> 1:02:01.952
and she's going to come get me.

1:02:01.986 --> 1:02:04.321
- Yeah, but Mommy told
me to come get you.

1:02:04.321 --> 1:02:05.322
- She did?

1:02:06.256 --> 1:02:08.125
- Yeah, I was just with her.

1:02:08.125 --> 1:02:10.795
Come on, I'll take
you somewhere safe.

1:02:10.828 --> 1:02:12.362
- When will this be over?

1:02:15.199 --> 1:02:17.001
- 10 minutes, and then
it'll all be done. Okay?

1:02:17.001 --> 1:02:18.803
I promise. Good girl. Come on.

1:02:21.205 --> 1:02:22.306
Hey, can I borrow this?

1:02:23.607 --> 1:02:25.309
Won't be needing that
where you're going.

1:02:25.309 --> 1:02:26.276
- Hmm?

1:02:26.276 --> 1:02:27.744
- Hmm?

1:02:27.812 --> 1:02:30.480
Oh, nothing, honey. I just
said we'd better get going.

1:02:33.283 --> 1:02:37.087
Do you know what, I think it's
much safer if you stay here.

1:02:37.087 --> 1:02:38.688
Just while I go get Mom.

1:02:38.688 --> 1:02:39.957
- Can I come with you?

1:02:42.692 --> 1:02:45.896
(raptor growls)

1:02:45.930 --> 1:02:47.965
- You still have company.

1:02:47.965 --> 1:02:50.434
(door closes)

1:02:51.535 --> 1:02:54.104
(raptor growls)

1:02:56.006 --> 1:02:59.409
(soft suspenseful music)

1:03:25.870 --> 1:03:28.605
(Peter sniffles)

1:03:31.375 --> 1:03:32.877
- [Sienna] Come on. Quickly.

1:03:32.877 --> 1:03:37.882
(Sienna shushes)
(Peter sniffles)

1:03:40.684 --> 1:03:44.088
(soft suspenseful music)

1:04:00.470 --> 1:04:03.040
(Sienna gasps)

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.642
- [Robot] Congratulations!

1:04:05.642 --> 1:04:08.245
With just 20 minutes
left of the game,

1:04:08.245 --> 1:04:10.881
you are the last
three contestants

1:04:10.881 --> 1:04:13.550
- What do you mean, there's
only me and Zara left?

1:04:13.617 --> 1:04:17.254
- [Robot] Yourself and
the children. Good luck.

1:04:17.287 --> 1:04:19.256
- What, no the children
aren't playing!

1:04:20.390 --> 1:04:22.026
- [Robot] As instructed earlier,

1:04:22.092 --> 1:04:26.130
whoever stepped inside
agreed to being involved.

1:04:26.163 --> 1:04:29.934
Now for a challenge.
You have five seconds,

1:04:29.934 --> 1:04:32.136
before I shall call...
- Stop it!

1:04:32.136 --> 1:04:34.038
[Robot] Attention.
(gun clicks)

1:04:34.038 --> 1:04:36.640
- [Robot] In five, four,
(raptor growls)

1:04:36.673 --> 1:04:37.474
three,

1:04:39.009 --> 1:04:40.410
two,

1:04:40.444 --> 1:04:41.645
one.

1:04:41.645 --> 1:04:42.947
- Look, you're going
to be okay, let's go.

1:04:43.013 --> 1:04:46.150
(siren blares)

1:04:46.150 --> 1:04:49.920
(intense suspenseful music)

1:04:52.122 --> 1:04:54.124
- [Peter] What do we do?

1:05:05.769 --> 1:05:08.772
- We can't get out.
Quickly, quickly.

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:10.007
This whole thing is a trap,

1:05:10.007 --> 1:05:12.209
and they do not want
us to survive, okay?

1:05:12.242 --> 1:05:16.480
Get under the bed, quickly,
and don't make a sound.

1:05:22.186 --> 1:05:25.589
(soft suspenseful music)

1:05:26.923 --> 1:05:29.626
(footsteps thud)

1:05:32.162 --> 1:05:34.798
(raptor growls)

1:05:37.834 --> 1:05:42.839

1:07:29.012 --> 1:07:30.514
- You both are okay.

1:07:30.514 --> 1:07:34.118
- Oh God, I thought
you were done for.

1:07:36.086 --> 1:07:38.888
We've got to watch out, there's
raptors inside the house.

1:07:40.190 --> 1:07:43.493
Wait, I thought you were dead.

1:07:43.527 --> 1:07:46.630
- Yeah. I had a few
close encounters, but
I'm fine, luckily.

1:07:48.165 --> 1:07:51.268
- But the robot it said
there was there of us left.

1:07:52.436 --> 1:07:55.038
- Yeah, Sam will be
round here somewhere.

1:07:55.038 --> 1:07:57.707
It got crazy earlier,
we had to separate.

1:07:57.774 --> 1:08:02.146
- No, he said the three of
us, myself and the kids.

1:08:03.046 --> 1:08:05.249
Why didn't it count you?

1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:14.124
(raptor growls)

1:08:14.124 --> 1:08:16.326
(raptor roars)

1:08:16.326 --> 1:08:19.796
(suspenseful piano music)

1:08:23.267 --> 1:08:25.934
(raptor growls)

1:08:25.969 --> 1:08:27.171
Maddie!

1:08:27.203 --> 1:08:28.805
- You weren't supposed
to figure that out.

1:08:28.805 --> 1:08:31.175
Clever girl, there.

1:08:31.175 --> 1:08:34.310
- What the hell
is going on here?

1:08:34.310 --> 1:08:37.681
(raptor growls)

1:08:37.681 --> 1:08:40.317
(raptor growls)

1:08:41.684 --> 1:08:44.288
(raptor roars)

1:08:45.488 --> 1:08:48.825
- What do you think
is going on, Sienna?

1:08:50.594 --> 1:08:54.264
Your in a game, and only
the fittest survive.

1:08:55.332 --> 1:08:57.467
- Get out of my way.

1:08:57.467 --> 1:09:00.370
- Maddie's in there with
a little friend of mine.

1:09:00.404 --> 1:09:02.238
So let's see if she
has what it takes.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:05.875
My clock says there's
only 10 minutes left,

1:09:05.908 --> 1:09:08.344
and then we need to
crown just one survivor.

1:09:11.648 --> 1:09:13.282
- Get out of my way!

1:09:15.519 --> 1:09:16.920
- Don't tempt me.

1:09:18.522 --> 1:09:20.657
- Why are you doing this?

1:09:20.690 --> 1:09:22.226
- Because it's fun.

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:26.796
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1:09:28.565 --> 1:09:30.800
Really soon, me
and you are going

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:32.636
to have something in common.

1:09:32.669 --> 1:09:34.271
Yeah.

1:09:34.271 --> 1:09:36.273
I watched my mom die, too.

1:09:36.273 --> 1:09:37.407
(gun clicks)

1:09:37.407 --> 1:09:40.042
(robot putters)

1:09:42.912 --> 1:09:45.113
- [Robot] That is
against the rules.

1:09:45.113 --> 1:09:47.050
The only way a
winner can be crowned

1:09:47.083 --> 1:09:50.353
is by surviving the
hotel's obstacles.

1:09:50.353 --> 1:09:53.056
Human interference
is not prohibited.

1:09:55.392 --> 1:09:56.925
- I make up the rules.

1:09:56.925 --> 1:10:00.029
- [Robot] The rules were
set before the game began.

1:10:00.096 --> 1:10:02.130
This was not one of them.

1:10:08.371 --> 1:10:13.209
(Sienna grunts)
(Zara grunts)

1:10:13.243 --> 1:10:14.278
- Good shot!

1:10:18.282 --> 1:10:20.148
- Who the hell are you?

1:10:22.151 --> 1:10:24.487
- The Games Master.

1:10:24.521 --> 1:10:27.591
How are you finding it, being
one of the lucky finalists?

1:10:29.726 --> 1:10:32.329
Looks like you got one
more obstacle to overcome.

1:10:33.397 --> 1:10:35.130
This is going to be a good one.

1:10:37.967 --> 1:10:40.969
(Sienna grunts)

1:10:40.969 --> 1:10:42.806
(Sienna grunts)

1:10:42.806 --> 1:10:45.875
(intense suspenseful music)
(Sienna pants)

1:10:45.909 --> 1:10:48.512
(Sienna grunts)

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:55.452
(Zara grunts)
(Sienna grunts)

1:11:00.089 --> 1:11:02.359
(Zara pants)

1:11:06.696 --> 1:11:11.668
- First one I get to
take out on my own.

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:17.106
(door chimes)
(door opens)

1:11:17.173 --> 1:11:20.043
(raptor growls)

1:11:20.043 --> 1:11:22.679
(raptor growls)

1:11:25.615 --> 1:11:27.317
(raptor growls)

1:11:27.317 --> 1:11:29.886
(Zara screams)

1:11:34.090 --> 1:11:37.226
(Zara screams)

1:11:37.226 --> 1:11:39.429
(Sienna screams)

1:11:39.429 --> 1:11:42.065
(raptor growls)

1:11:48.505 --> 1:11:50.273
- Whoa, not so fast!

1:11:51.441 --> 1:11:52.675
Still a couple of
minutes on the clock.

1:11:52.709 --> 1:11:54.511
- Kids get in the car.

1:11:56.012 --> 1:11:57.447
- [Games Master] I must say
you really surprise me there.

1:11:57.447 --> 1:11:59.549
Never thought you had it in you.

1:11:59.616 --> 1:12:02.886
You surprised me. I
guess she was right.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:05.889
Never cross a mother's love.

1:12:07.724 --> 1:12:09.025
- What is this, huh?

1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:11.628
What the hell is this?

1:12:13.129 --> 1:12:16.766
Some sick game for
your entertainment?

1:12:16.766 --> 1:12:19.168
- I guess you could
say that, yes.

1:12:19.202 --> 1:12:22.305
Would've been wonderful,
the ultimate death match.

1:12:23.507 --> 1:12:25.442
Man versus dinosaur.

1:12:26.576 --> 1:12:27.677
- You're sick.

1:12:29.212 --> 1:12:32.081
- Me and many, many
more. Believe it.

1:12:33.483 --> 1:12:35.952
Do you think I'm the
only one watching?

1:12:35.952 --> 1:12:37.487
This place rigged with cameras.

1:12:38.888 --> 1:12:40.356
People pay a pretty dollar,

1:12:41.958 --> 1:12:44.693
just to have the
privilege to watch in.

1:12:44.728 --> 1:12:45.728
Bets are placed.

1:12:46.930 --> 1:12:49.833
Think of it as your
local gambling show.

1:12:51.668 --> 1:12:53.603
Just live and hidden.

1:12:57.373 --> 1:12:59.776
- One minute left on the clock.

1:12:59.776 --> 1:13:01.077
- Not to mention, the millions

1:13:01.077 --> 1:13:04.313
of pounds that
people have invested,

1:13:04.347 --> 1:13:06.049
just for the outcome
of this game.

1:13:14.389 --> 1:13:16.793
- [Robot] Welcome
to the final minute.

1:13:16.826 --> 1:13:18.962
Only one will be
crowned the winner.

1:13:24.601 --> 1:13:28.605
- She's coming, and I'll
tell you now, she's hungry.

1:13:34.177 --> 1:13:35.111
As you were warned,

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:39.415
three of you remain
only one will win.

1:13:41.751 --> 1:13:43.687
- [Robot] 45 seconds remaining.

1:13:45.489 --> 1:13:47.957
(T-Rex roars)

1:13:52.228 --> 1:13:53.329
- Isn't she beautiful?

1:14:00.737 --> 1:14:04.907
- I won.

1:14:04.907 --> 1:14:07.410
You're part of this game, too.

1:14:09.344 --> 1:14:10.146
Right?

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:14.618
(gun fires)
(Games Master yelps)

1:14:14.618 --> 1:14:16.753
- Where did you find that?

1:14:19.523 --> 1:14:21.925
You entered the house,
just like the rest of us.

1:14:23.493 --> 1:14:25.562
You enter,
(T-Rex growls)

1:14:25.562 --> 1:14:26.362
you play.

1:14:29.432 --> 1:14:31.601
So say hi to her for me.

1:14:31.601 --> 1:14:34.638
- [Robot] Congratulations,
Sienna woods!

1:14:34.671 --> 1:14:38.107
Yourself, Peter, and Maddie
have survived the night,

1:14:38.174 --> 1:14:42.278
and are the successful winners
of this years competition.

1:14:42.278 --> 1:14:47.282
(T-Rex growls)
(Games Master grunts)

1:14:58.762 --> 1:15:03.633
(T-Rex roars)
(Games Master screams)

1:15:03.633 --> 1:15:05.602
- Did we win?
- I think so.

1:15:09.906 --> 1:15:11.474
- We're going home.

1:15:14.243 --> 1:15:16.445
(car revs)

1:15:20.483 --> 1:15:22.952
(T-Rex roars)

1:15:27.389 --> 1:15:29.559
- [Robot] Until next year.

1:15:31.394 --> 1:15:34.798
(intense dramatic music)
