that the cell tower ping

35:26.249 --> 35:28.166
At first, I thought he was
an ally,

35:28.249 --> 35:30.625
and so,
I thought nothing of him,

35:30.708 --> 35:33.708
and he wanted to show me
something in the barn,

35:34.541 --> 35:35.792
like he said.

35:35.875 --> 35:38.750
Uh, then I saw
the wound on his neck.

35:38.833 --> 35:41.333
My next thought was that
he was delivering me up

35:41.416 --> 35:44.333
like Tracey Powell delivered
those sisters in Dayton.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.041

Finally, I came
to the conclusion

36:01.249 --> 36:03.333
that he was taking me somewhere
to, um...

36:03.875 --> 36:04.875
