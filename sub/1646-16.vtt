WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.794
Previously on Prison Break...

00:02.877 --> 00:05.797
The price of the operation
is the safe return of Scylla.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.382
See if the buyer
left him a message.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.592
Yeah, it's a
Miami area code.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.344
The item.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.389
I'm sure you understand
no one can know where Scylla's going.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.977
Do you know who took it?

00:19.060 --> 00:21.187
No, but Self
and Gretchen do.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.188
Then you've got your team.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.231
I'm not working for them.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.607
There are holes in your résumé

00:24.691 --> 00:27.652
that Gretchen or Self
or even Bagwell can fill.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.824
What happened?

00:32.907 --> 00:34.409
He got away.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.248
What's this?

00:40.331 --> 00:42.459
My resignation.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.336
Whatever plan you're working on
to get us out of here,

00:45.420 --> 00:46.546
we better make a move on it.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.131
You're not getting
out of here, Michael.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.382
I made a deal.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.176
Your life
in exchange for Scylla.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.427
You think you can do that,

00:52.510 --> 00:53.720
knowing what you know
about the Company?

00:53.803 --> 00:55.430
You want to know
what I know about the Company?

00:55.513 --> 00:57.182
Mom worked for them
before she died.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.516
Now, I'm gonna do

00:58.600 --> 01:02.520
everything and anything
I can to end this.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.120
Hello?

01:19.704 --> 01:21.790
Sara, it's me.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.749
Where are you?

01:23.374 --> 01:25.168
Miami. The guy
who took Scylla's here.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.921
So you're-you're actually trying
to get it back for the Company?

01:28.004 --> 01:30.423
I'm gonna give it back
to the Company so we can

01:30.507 --> 01:31.758
walk away from this.

01:31.841 --> 01:32.759
How's Michael?

01:32.842 --> 01:33.802
I don't know.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.012
I don't know.
Two guys from the Company came,

01:36.096 --> 01:38.556
and they brought me to a hotel,

01:38.640 --> 01:41.434
and-and I was given... flowers

01:41.518 --> 01:42.727
and a fruit basket,

01:42.811 --> 01:45.146
and absolutely
no information about Michael.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.231
Is Fernando with you?

01:46.314 --> 01:48.108
Sucre split.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.234
We, uh, we left some messages

01:49.317 --> 01:50.985
with Mahone, telling him

01:51.069 --> 01:52.028
where we are, but that

01:52.112 --> 01:53.071
was two cell phones back.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.532
Sorry, who's "we"?
Who are you with?

01:55.615 --> 01:57.992
People I don't trust.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.870
Okay.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.248
Listen, um...

02:03.331 --> 02:04.916
Lincoln, I know
why you did it, and-and...

02:04.999 --> 02:07.418
I'm grateful to you,
because he was gonna die.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.963
But do you really think that

02:10.046 --> 02:12.257
they're just gonna let us live
when we give them Scylla?

02:13.216 --> 02:14.884
You know what, Sara,
I'm doing my best.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.511
Just-just call me

02:16.594 --> 02:19.139
if you hear anything
about Michael, please.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.474
Linc, the Company's data tech

02:21.558 --> 02:23.685
finally got a hit
on our guy's cell phone.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.396
It's a number,
and it goes to this address--

02:26.479 --> 02:27.814
The Grafton; it's a club.

02:27.897 --> 02:28.815
How many calls?

02:28.898 --> 02:30.692
Three. All outgoing.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.527
How do we know
this guy's still in Miami,

02:32.610 --> 02:34.070
that he hasn't
sold it already, huh?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.572
Not that I'm
complaining.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.991
I've had some filthy,
filthy times in this state.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.159
Don't screw this up,
all right?

02:39.242 --> 02:42.078
Because that's our
only lead on this guy.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.830
Be thankful
I haven't killed you.

02:43.913 --> 02:47.792
Oh, yeah? Wh-What are you,
Eliot Ness now? Huh?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.377
What, are you upset because
I screwed you over, Linc?

02:49.460 --> 02:50.712
'Cause don't act like

02:50.795 --> 02:52.463
you haven't done that
to ten times as many people.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.924
All right? We're just crooks
that got caught, Lincoln.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.843
This...

02:57.093 --> 02:58.720
this guy, this isn't gonna work.

02:58.803 --> 03:02.432
Why don't we all just focus
on who's got Scylla?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.559
What do you say?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.689
♪ ♪

04:11.251 --> 04:13.878
Hey, Scofield.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.179
Where am I?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.764
He's awake.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.099
I said, where am I?

04:26.182 --> 04:28.601
It's a house,
in the woods,

04:28.685 --> 04:30.186
60 miles from anywhere.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.522
Swept clean of weapons,
so you don't need

04:32.605 --> 04:34.440
to worry your
head about that.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.734
There are no bars on
the windows or the doors,

04:36.818 --> 04:39.362
but there are three types of
mountain lion in the area,

04:39.445 --> 04:41.072
so you might want
to stay close by.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.824
I'll take it from here.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.287
Dr. Roger Knowlton, Michael.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.122
How are you feeling?

04:49.205 --> 04:51.124
You some kind of neurologist?

04:51.207 --> 04:52.834
Psychiatrist.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.043
Given that you've got

04:54.127 --> 04:56.546
some free time, the General
asked if I'd sit with you.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.799
A cigar's a cigar.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.301
Are we done?

05:01.384 --> 05:04.387
You've been operating
under some...

05:04.470 --> 05:06.806
misconceptions
about the Company,

05:06.889 --> 05:08.057
and the General wants

05:08.141 --> 05:09.434
to, uh, open the books.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.186
I'm here to... provide facts

05:12.270 --> 05:14.272
and to help you process them.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.441
If by facts, you mean
what's on Scylla

05:16.524 --> 05:18.985
and that my mother
once worked for the Company,

05:19.068 --> 05:21.612
I already know
these things.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.407
"Worked"?

05:27.910 --> 05:29.996
Your mother...

05:30.079 --> 05:32.457
works for us.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.753
Your mother is alive.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.049
Hey.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.384
We don't open
till 3:00.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.469
It's all good.
I'm just looking for someone.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.887
Haven't got the guy's name,

06:27.970 --> 06:30.014
uh, but he called
here yesterday

06:30.098 --> 06:32.058
about three times--
New Yorker, dark hair,

06:32.141 --> 06:34.477
bits of gray.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.397
You know where I can find him?

06:37.480 --> 06:40.775
Uh, yeah, I can't
help you. Sorry.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.653
You sure?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.571
My man, you need
to check your ears,

06:45.655 --> 06:47.407
all right, 'cause he just said we don't
know who you're talking about.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.283
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.412
Well, what about blondie?

06:54.622 --> 06:56.666
You've got about
two seconds...

07:01.712 --> 07:02.839
How about it?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.549
I don't know his name.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.592
-How about it!
-I don't know his name!

07:06.676 --> 07:07.510
He works...

07:07.593 --> 07:09.220
this girl... works here,
he dates her.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.348
You're gonna take me to her.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.770
Well, this is all just...

07:17.854 --> 07:20.440
fascinating, Doctor.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.276
I don't know how better to say this.

07:23.359 --> 07:26.446
She left you and your
brother to protect you.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.699
From the dangers
of solar synthesis work?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.534
I know what's on Scylla.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.871
There were threats, you and
Lincoln might be kidnapped.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.664
You were in
imminent danger.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.249
Really.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.625
Where was she when
my brother was strapped

07:39.709 --> 07:41.252
to an electric chair?
She'd been working

07:41.335 --> 07:43.963
in a Madagascar
rain forest,

07:44.046 --> 07:45.256
without satellite access.

07:45.339 --> 07:50.219
Or she wasn't alive,
hasn't been for 25 years,

07:50.303 --> 07:51.762
and this is all fiction.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.311
There's a million acres,
corn and soy, outside Cordoba

07:58.394 --> 08:02.648
that was arid scrub before
your mother's research.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.484
That's not fiction,

08:04.567 --> 08:05.693
that's food...

08:05.776 --> 08:07.487
for thousands.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.654
Millions.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.822
There's so much more

08:09.906 --> 08:10.990
on Scylla than you know.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.117
It sounds like we'd have
a lot to talk about.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.036
Why don't you get her
on the phone.

08:15.119 --> 08:17.330
When you're ready.

08:17.413 --> 08:20.666
No time like the present.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.044
When you're ready...

08:23.127 --> 08:25.630
to join her.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.465
Us.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.760
That's... what
this conversation

08:30.843 --> 08:32.637
is about.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.514
Joining...

08:34.597 --> 08:36.849
the Company.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.858
Hey, Erica, it's me.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.527
So, are you coming?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.613
I really need
to talk to you.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.453
She's on her way.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.415
Oh, my God!

09:01.499 --> 09:05.002
Why'd this guy call the club's
phone and not Erica's?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.171
I... They fight a lot,

09:07.255 --> 09:09.131
so when she doesn't answer,
he calls the club.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.177
What do you want with this guy?

09:13.261 --> 09:15.096
He took something
that belongs to me.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.348
I want it back.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.725
There.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.852
There's Erica.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.273
Wait here.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.756
He's got a gun!

10:23.039 --> 10:25.666
Get him stitched up.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.210
Big guy.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.795
Shaved head. Crazy.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.965
-Who the hell is he?
-I don't know.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.925
He bought the whole thing
about you being friends

10:35.009 --> 10:36.469
-with this chick or whatever?
-Yeah.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.179
He didn't know
I was with you,

10:38.262 --> 10:40.222
and by the time he did, he
was trying not to get shot.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.600
Hey, hey, hey.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.644
You did good.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.979
I just need a smoke so bad.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.272
Oh, no.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.940
What?

10:50.024 --> 10:51.651
My wallet.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.445
This is the chick who set me up.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.113
We find her, we find our guy.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.282
Busting up clubs,
firing shots in public.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.327
You keep that up and we're not
going to last here much longer.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.704
I don't plan on staying here very long.
You?

11:04.580 --> 11:06.749
See, that's why I have to give
it up to the General.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.251
He puts four enemies together,
guaranteed dissension.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.420
No alliances
form against him.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.714
This is our guy's
girlfriend's address.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.800
He's probably gone,
but see what you can find.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.555
This is Tia.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.895
Do you want to know what
I think they were talking about?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.188
I don't care.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.649
Just as long as they
keep out of my way.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.817
Same with you.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.784
Send her in.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.290
Sara! You're looking...

11:48.374 --> 11:49.875
rested.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.877
How is the hotel?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.546
I would like to offer
my professional

11:53.629 --> 11:55.798
assistance in
Michael's rehabilitation.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.217
Kind...

11:58.384 --> 11:59.427
but he's receiving
excellent care.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.178
There's nothing for you
to worry about.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.596
Whatever it is you
have planned for him,

12:02.680 --> 12:05.850
I would simply like to help
maintain his health.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.520
And that's appreciated,
but it's impossible.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.189
Believe me,
you serve Michael best

12:12.273 --> 12:13.524
at a distance
right now.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.818
Trust me.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.240
I have no agenda apart
from simply...

12:22.700 --> 12:24.034
wanting to see that he's okay.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.911
And in three days to a week,

12:26.078 --> 12:28.664
he'll be back
in your loving arms forever.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.500
Okay, I'm not that patient.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.336
Indulge yourself.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.380
Sit by the pool,

12:36.505 --> 12:38.007
envision the future:

12:38.090 --> 12:39.675
financial security,

12:40.301 --> 12:43.846
Michael's talents being utilized
on a global scale,

12:43.929 --> 12:45.181
you beside him innovating.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.476
Michael's talents being
utilized on a global scale?

12:49.101 --> 12:52.646
I'm simply trying to maximize
his potential.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.357
Yours, too.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.860
What's being done to him?

12:59.487 --> 13:03.032
I'm putting an end to this
exhausting cat-and-mouse.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.202
Thank you for stopping by.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.841
"Radical architecture
is a rejection of all formal

13:20.925 --> 13:23.469
and moral parameters."

13:23.552 --> 13:24.970
From your thesis.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.224
Someone else's words
heavily paraphrased.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.852
And it pertains
to buildings, structures.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.312
I think you meant it
as a metaphor.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.190
What, that the ends
justify the means?

13:36.273 --> 13:37.316
Which neatly

13:37.399 --> 13:38.567
coincides with
your mother's philosophy.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.861
Did you know that she had
an almost identical quote

13:40.945 --> 13:42.863
in her thesis?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.865
From 30 years ago.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.992
You've done a lot of homework.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.329
Just a few
conversations.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.915
Let me guess.
You two had some kind of moment

13:52.998 --> 13:54.250
at the Company Christmas party?

13:54.333 --> 13:57.628
I've known your mother
for years.

13:57.711 --> 14:01.298
Well enough to know you've got
the same brilliant mind

14:01.382 --> 14:03.592
and the same sense of humor,
for that matter.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.512
I'm guessing this isn't about
my sense of humor.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.848
She was just

14:08.931 --> 14:12.768
as resistant
to joining the Company,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.478
but then she learned
the truth.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.398
If the truth is that the Company
is all about saving the world,

14:17.481 --> 14:18.607
I don't buy it.

14:18.691 --> 14:23.070
And if my mother is so brilliant
and active in the Company,

14:23.153 --> 14:25.030
what do you want with me?

14:25.114 --> 14:29.285
A fully functioning Scylla
project would exist

14:29.368 --> 14:30.327
on a global scale.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.412
It can't be managed

14:31.495 --> 14:33.455
by one person.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.332
But two...

14:35.416 --> 14:40.796
equally formidable,
working in lockstep?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.798
Absolutely.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.884
That's very good.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.637
You've clearly thought
of everything.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.306
Michael...

14:52.391 --> 14:54.852
...if I weren't telling you
the truth,

14:54.935 --> 14:59.189
how would I have gotten this?

15:44.068 --> 15:46.528
Go, go, go, go.

15:58.540 --> 16:02.753
This is just a stupid girl
who dates a criminal.

16:02.836 --> 16:03.837
This is a waste of time.

16:03.921 --> 16:07.049
A signature of Burrows'
leadership.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.217
All right, we need
to make a shift.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.760
Bagwell, I'm telling you
right now,

16:09.843 --> 16:11.804
if I make my play
and you go soft,

16:11.887 --> 16:13.681
I will sail you off
that loft balcony

16:13.764 --> 16:14.765
and no one will bat an eye.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.725
My aim is true, Don.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.810
Keep it in your pants.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.397
I'll keep it in
my pants, all right?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.816
All right, all in favor of
changing the regime, say "Aye."

16:23.899 --> 16:25.693
Aye, aye, Captain.

16:25.776 --> 16:29.488
Aye. All right, Burrows is out.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.243
Good, great. Send it.

16:34.326 --> 16:38.330
The Company's e-mailing
Tia's credit card history.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.751
You know, I'm thinking more and
more that this is an inside job.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.713
Why?
A couple reasons.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.089
The hardware he
brought to the meet.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.757
He could read Scylla
right on the spot.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.926
Since he's disappeared,

16:51.010 --> 16:53.095
I should be able to find
this man, and I can't.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.930
People you can't find are
usually Company.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.432
How does that change anything?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.599
It doesn't.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.184
It just makes everything harder.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.399
Lincoln...

17:05.482 --> 17:06.900
Yeah?

17:06.984 --> 17:09.403
When are we going to get this
out of the way?

17:09.486 --> 17:10.946
What?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.073
Of all the mercenary humps
I've thrown at guys

17:13.157 --> 17:16.660
in my lifetime, I think I'm due
for one I want.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.662
Don't flatter yourself.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.125
Too late.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.545
Name it.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.131
And I do mean anything.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.553
A big ol' fat load
of nothin'!

17:34.636 --> 17:38.057
A big ol' goose egg.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.935
Nothing. Old address books, photographs,

17:42.019 --> 17:43.228
hard drive
from her computer.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.688
I checked her e-mails
and her Web sites.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.023
There's nothing from our guy.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.317
Are you sure this girlfriend
route is the way to go here?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.027
Because this is starting
to feel like a wasted trip.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.695
How long is it gonna take
the Company

17:51.779 --> 17:52.738
to pull everything
off this thing?

17:52.821 --> 17:53.989
A couple hours.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.658
All right, Linc,
this is the deal.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.910
Look, we appreciate your effort,

17:57.993 --> 18:00.287
but Bagwell and I
took a vote,

18:00.370 --> 18:04.500
and this being Florida and all,
you came up a little bit short.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.542
Meaning?

18:05.626 --> 18:06.710
You're not in charge.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.628
Who is?

18:07.711 --> 18:09.088
Him.
Yeah.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.339
The bull-in-the-china-
shop routine

18:10.422 --> 18:11.924
might have worked when
you were stealing gumballs,

18:12.007 --> 18:14.760
but our asses are
on the line now, okay?

18:14.843 --> 18:16.053
And we all have deals
with the General.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.180
So that's the way
it's gonna be.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.682
And if you notice, even Gretchen hasn't
leapt to your defense.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.018
Linc, just let him wear
his crown.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.062
I would if I thought he wasn't
gonna sell this thing.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.064
Oh, what, am I the only one
who's thought about that?

18:27.147 --> 18:28.232
Look, here's the
deal, Linc.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.775
At some point,
you'll have a vote.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.026
But until then,
you're done, all right?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.486
We're shuttin' you down, okay?

18:32.569 --> 18:34.321
You're no longer in charge.

18:41.161 --> 18:44.248
Uh-oh, looks like
there's been a recount.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.415
Bad time?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.709
No, perfect.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.090
The second you stop

18:53.173 --> 18:55.968
doing what I tell you to do,

18:56.051 --> 18:58.303
I'm gonna blow your brains out.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.485
Bring her back.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.404
It's not gonna be
the same.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.240
Stir any memories?

19:22.661 --> 19:28.333
I was ten. We were on a camping
trip in Jackson Hole.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.377
Fishing, hiking...

19:30.460 --> 19:33.338
family huddled under a blanket
in front of the bonfire.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.256
You can stop now.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.758
Why? Because two years later
it was gone?

19:36.842 --> 19:39.928
You know, three
of the four

19:40.012 --> 19:41.763
people in this photograph
are still alive.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.599
So what are you
suggesting,

19:43.682 --> 19:45.475
grab my fishing pole?

19:45.559 --> 19:46.518
Time for a...

19:46.602 --> 19:48.562
a family reunion in Wyoming?

19:48.645 --> 19:50.272
Or wherever you like.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.108
Don't tell me it's something
you haven't wished for.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.696
I've wished for a lot
of unrealistic things.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.115
I got over them, too.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.575
Why,

20:01.658 --> 20:04.244
when we can make this happen?

20:05.704 --> 20:09.875
These pictures could have been
taken anywhere at any time.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.126
Before you were incarcerated,

20:11.210 --> 20:14.046
you'd go to visit her grave
on the anniversary

20:14.129 --> 20:15.255
of her funeral.
That's enough.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.466
You'd bring a bouquet
of blue irises.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.383
You'd sit for an hour.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.301
I said stop it.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.510
When you'd leave,
you'd take a flower

20:20.594 --> 20:21.637
and pin it to your lapel.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.597
She watched you
do this every year.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.765
She's seen the pain you carry.

20:24.848 --> 20:25.682
She wants
to make amends.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.142
All right!

20:28.143 --> 20:31.271
So you did a little digging.
Good for you.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.649
But everything out of your mouth
is a lie,

20:33.732 --> 20:35.442
and I don't believe a word
of it.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.029
So let's just stop.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.408
Let's just stop.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.664
That's Tia's address

20:48.747 --> 20:50.374
right there.
Pull it up.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.212
All right, she lives here,
works here, but yesterday

20:55.295 --> 20:57.130
she used her credit card
to buy a drink

20:57.214 --> 20:58.340
at the Pelican Club
a little after noon,

20:58.423 --> 21:00.550
and then she picked up
something at the gift shop

21:00.634 --> 21:01.635
a little after 1:00.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.387
Waiting for her
boyfriend to debark.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.305
Disembark.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.516
He's already in town.
Yeah.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.102
Then he lives in the Marina.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.146
Or this is another reason
to think it's an inside job.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.148
If he's working with someone
from the Company,

21:15.232 --> 21:17.818
they wouldn't want their names
on any flight manifests.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.403
All right, they're trying
to get Scylla

21:19.486 --> 21:20.946
out of the country
by boat undetected.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.990
Let's go.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.324
Alex,
Yeah?

21:25.409 --> 21:28.245
thanks for coming
when you did, man.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.790
You helped me like you said
you would. I owe you.

22:01.194 --> 22:04.072
♪ ♪

22:17.502 --> 22:18.837
Okay, I'll do the talking.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.922
You guys wait here.
Alex, let's go.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.054
Afternoon.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.055
How's it going?

22:28.138 --> 22:29.598
What can I do you for?

22:29.681 --> 22:30.599
Recognize her?

22:30.682 --> 22:32.559
Her name's Tia Hayden.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.354
Can't say I do.
Wish I did.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.605
Nice little tomato there.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.231
She was in here yesterday
with a man.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.567
Can't help.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.027
Sorry.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.237
I'm Don Self
with Homeland Security.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.989
And this is my partner
Bruce Liberace.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.533
No relation.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.077
Our department is working
with the Office

22:50.160 --> 22:52.079
of Foreign Assets Control.
Have you heard of them?

22:52.162 --> 22:53.080
Yep.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.706
I'll bet you have.
We're looking into smuggling

22:54.790 --> 22:57.417
and contraband transportation
of Cuban cigars.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.753
None here, swear to God.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.588
All right, well,
that's for us to decide.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.048
It's going
to take about a week,

23:03.131 --> 23:05.008
and it's going to involve shutting
down this entire marina...

23:05.092 --> 23:06.218
Oh, yeah.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.260
...for about a week.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.595
-Or...
-She was here

23:08.678 --> 23:12.015
with that guy
you were talking about.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.726
He wanted to know which berth a
private charter was docking in.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.603
He asked me to move it further
down the dock, which I did.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.605
Further away
from the Coast Guard slip?

23:18.688 --> 23:21.608
I didn't ask.
And I didn't accept any money.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.151
If he said he paid me,
he's lying.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.444
What's the point of departure?

23:24.528 --> 23:26.238
Nassau, Bahamas. Round trip.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.948
When does it arrive?

23:28.031 --> 23:30.784
Arrived.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.288
Hey, everybody!
Okay, my name is Don Self!

23:35.372 --> 23:37.082
Homeland Security.

23:37.165 --> 23:41.253
My colleagues and I are hoping
that you guys have a wonderful

23:41.336 --> 23:43.672
and safe trip.
Unfortunately,

23:43.755 --> 23:46.800
we're going to have to do
a quick luggage check search.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.510
Shouldn't take more
than a minute, folks.

23:48.593 --> 23:49.845
Your cooperation is all

23:49.928 --> 23:52.514
that's required.
Open your bags, folks.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.642
That's fine.
Thank you very much.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.214
Get on your knees!

24:26.298 --> 24:27.674
Okay, okay, okay.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.469
Where is it?
Where's Scylla?

24:30.552 --> 24:32.012
What have you
got in here?

24:32.095 --> 24:35.015
Huh?

24:35.098 --> 24:37.642
Three joints.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.276
I'm on probation.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.653
Is this going to send me back?

24:53.783 --> 24:56.036
Make yourself
a helmet, pal.

24:56.119 --> 24:59.080
Just like old times.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.127
Bring her back.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.670
You know
I can't do that.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.049
But, look, there's
some stuff

25:09.132 --> 25:10.383
that I can do.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.593
It's not going to be the same,

25:11.676 --> 25:14.012
but we're going
to figure it out.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.514
And, no matter what,

25:15.597 --> 25:16.806
it's still going
to be me and you.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.935
I am thrilled that

25:20.018 --> 25:22.354
you're enjoying your trip
to the mountains,

25:22.437 --> 25:24.689
but it's not
an open-ended vacation.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.068
Scofield's exhausted.
Despondent.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.153
He's very resistant,
but a classic abandoned child.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.279
He'll come around.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.447
Time frame, Doctor?

25:32.531 --> 25:35.492
Unaided, three days.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.952
With the pentothal?

25:37.035 --> 25:41.957
Sooner, but it's nearly
a chemical lobotomy.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.960
But if he turns on his own,
it'll be his decision,

25:45.043 --> 25:46.336
his reasoning.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.255
We'll own him forever.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.965
Scofield's squirrelly.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.634
I won't trust him
till he walks hot coals.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.303
I think I can get him there.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.638
Good. But, if

25:56.721 --> 25:59.558
I find out he's been
playing you, Doctor,

25:59.641 --> 26:02.185
you'll get the same lobotomy
as Scofield.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.063
Just get it done.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.926
Let's go.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.886
In the van.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.561
Go!

27:14.591 --> 27:16.509
If you fight
when those cuffs are off,

27:16.593 --> 27:18.053
the guards will stomp the life
out of you.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.056
Yeah.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.646
Forgive
the dramatics.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.606
The Company can't know
I'm talking to you.

27:29.689 --> 27:32.359
You are the Company.
You're his daughter.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.443
Do you want
to find Michael Scofield?

27:33.526 --> 27:35.528
Of course I do.

27:38.573 --> 27:40.450
It's 60 miles northeast

27:40.533 --> 27:42.577
of downtown.
And I'd move quickly.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.162
What are they doing to him?

27:44.245 --> 27:45.830
Having lemonade.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.042
They're carving out
his personality.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.085
That's how they recruit.

27:50.168 --> 27:53.421
Or you're setting me up.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.631
Clandestine warfare
isn't pretty,

27:54.714 --> 27:55.965
but the rules of engagement

27:56.049 --> 27:58.093
don't include killing
and torturing the innocent.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.719
At least not for me.

27:59.803 --> 28:03.223
Michael is the object
of a quick and nasty

28:03.306 --> 28:06.685
process,
and you're wasting time.

28:06.768 --> 28:07.811
Out.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.563
Out.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.319
Ask if they're...

28:19.864 --> 28:21.741
We need the footage
from that security camera.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.493
Not to offend either of you,
but I took

28:23.576 --> 28:24.911
the liberty of
calling my attorney

28:24.994 --> 28:27.956
to find out exactly what the
scope of your authority is here,

28:28.039 --> 28:31.584
and he tells me
there is no... I need the tape, all right?

28:33.336 --> 28:35.922
Sure.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.051
Either we
missed Scylla...

28:40.135 --> 28:42.387
No, no, no. We did not miss Scylla.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.555
We searched every bag.

28:43.638 --> 28:46.641
Then maybe the buyer was
already on the boat,

28:46.725 --> 28:48.977
and was disembarking, right?

28:49.060 --> 28:52.272
I mean, if they don't want their
names on any flight manifest,

28:52.355 --> 28:53.982
maybe they just eased
back on in.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.151
That wouldn't
be the worst news.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.444
That means they're in Miami.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.696
Right. So get yourself
back down

28:59.779 --> 29:02.240
with your disgraced badge
to Steamboat Willie,

29:02.323 --> 29:03.533
and have him cough up every name

29:03.616 --> 29:05.285
of every person on that boat
coming off.

29:05.368 --> 29:07.370
Okay, that's good, because

29:07.454 --> 29:09.122
they probably would
have traveled in

29:09.205 --> 29:10.165
on a low-grade charter

29:10.248 --> 29:12.459
from the Bahamas,
and used their

29:12.542 --> 29:14.294
real names, right?

29:14.377 --> 29:16.129
That would
be a good plan.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.006
How is he?

29:18.089 --> 29:19.841
He's alive.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.344
So we get Scylla.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.347
Then we're free, all of us--
Pam, LJ...

29:26.431 --> 29:29.142
All of a sudden,
the Company grew a heart?

29:29.225 --> 29:30.351
They're just
tired of us.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.020
They want Scylla back.
That's it.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.190
Then we never really
had anything they wanted.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.692
Exactly.
Now we got leverage.

29:39.652 --> 29:42.071
We don't have it yet.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.287
Anything?

29:49.370 --> 29:51.414
No.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.999
Nothing yet.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.752
Nothing.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.672
No, Lincoln,
you don't understand.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.299
The way she said "recruit"
made my stomach turn.

30:01.382 --> 30:02.342
They're going to torture him.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.385
He can take care of himself

30:04.469 --> 30:06.387
at least for one day
until we get Scylla.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.057
Lincoln, he needs
to be in the ICU.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.099
What's your plan?

30:10.183 --> 30:12.227
Break him out?

30:12.310 --> 30:13.645
I don't know. I don't have one.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.688
Well, you're putting him
and us at risk.

30:15.772 --> 30:19.067
Just stay in the hotel
until we get back to L.A.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.735
All right?

30:35.041 --> 30:36.793
Yes?

30:36.876 --> 30:40.213
Tancredi got the location
of her shining knight.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.548
She may be heading there now.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.091
Exemplary, Bagwell.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.760
Thank you, sir.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.930
A deal's a deal, right?
Not to be a broken record,

30:49.013 --> 30:50.807
but all I ask...

31:00.316 --> 31:03.570
I think we're making
some real progress, General.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.029
The Scofield/Burrows family

31:05.113 --> 31:06.865
would have been a formidable
asset to the Company,

31:06.948 --> 31:10.243
but since his lapdog insists
on complicating matters,

31:10.326 --> 31:12.453
we move on.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.289
General,
we can handle a lone female.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.415
If, indeed,

31:15.498 --> 31:16.499
that's what we're dealing with.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.376
But it's my experience,

31:18.459 --> 31:20.295
that with the one comes many.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.963
Do it now, Doctor.

31:22.046 --> 31:25.049
I need an hour. He just ate.
I don't want him to aspirate.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.467
Now,

31:26.551 --> 31:28.553
Doctor.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.763
I want Scofield pliable
for transit.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.558
And your vehicle arrives
in 20 minutes.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.310
And if we can't revive him?

31:35.393 --> 31:39.022
C'est la vie!

31:52.035 --> 31:55.705
Michael, come out.
We need to talk.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.299
Make yourself
a helmet, pal.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.103
That's it!

32:19.187 --> 32:20.939
That's our guy!

32:21.022 --> 32:22.398
There's Tia right beside him.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.108
We've got to pull that image,
get it to the Company,

32:24.192 --> 32:25.526
and have them match it.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.527
Where's Gretchen?

32:59.268 --> 33:00.979
How'd you find me?

33:01.854 --> 33:04.232
Once I found
your mug shot,

33:04.315 --> 33:08.319
it really wasn't that hard
getting your legit cell number.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.488
Well, now I'm here.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.948
What do you want?

33:12.031 --> 33:14.575
You never bothered to ask
back in Los Angeles--

33:14.659 --> 33:16.202
you were too busy
planning on killing me--

33:16.619 --> 33:18.538
but I actually worked
for the Company.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.331
I know who you are.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.750
And I'll ask it again.

33:22.834 --> 33:23.960
What do you want?

33:25.003 --> 33:27.005
To solve your problems, Scott.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.675
I mean, it is what gets me
up out of bed in the morning.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.720
You have a big problem,
and so does

33:33.803 --> 33:35.054
whoever it is
you're working for.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.431
And you obviously know that,

33:36.514 --> 33:38.141
or you wouldn't have graced
me with your presence.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.351
And you can make
that problem disappear?

33:40.435 --> 33:42.186
Quickly and completely.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.856
With an extra added bonus.

33:44.981 --> 33:47.692
Crucial, I might add.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.861
I then feed the Company
a story

33:49.944 --> 33:50.820
that has them looking elsewhere.

33:51.571 --> 33:52.822
Meaning you're invaluable

33:52.947 --> 33:54.699
-and please don't kill you.
-Yeah.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.951
Without the "please."

33:58.453 --> 33:59.454
How much?

33:59.579 --> 34:00.705
A lot.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.832
And it's about to double
here in a second

34:02.915 --> 34:05.543
if you don't look at me
when I'm talking to you.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.214
You go run and talk it over
with your boss.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.550
Call me with a number.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.011
I'm authorized to negotiate
on their behalf.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.346
If you serve up

34:17.430 --> 34:20.433
whoever's looking for us and get
the Company off our scent--

34:22.393 --> 34:23.811
$10 million.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.606
Best and final offer.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.567
Ask for a penny more,
and I'll shoot you

34:29.650 --> 34:31.944
in the chest
and take my chances.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.837
Take it easy, Michael.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.006
This...

34:52.090 --> 34:54.008
is for your own good.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.218
What was that?

34:55.301 --> 34:56.344
Sounded like
the water heater.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.764
Came from the bathroom.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.487
Pick it up!

35:18.116 --> 35:20.326
You're never getting
out of here.

35:21.285 --> 35:24.330
Now give the doctor
his medicine.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.465
No.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.806
Bedpost.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.589
Let's go!

36:14.672 --> 36:16.841
In here, in the bedroom.

36:16.924 --> 36:17.967
Come on!

36:18.050 --> 36:20.595
Get the cuff key, now!

36:46.204 --> 36:47.622
That's great.

36:47.705 --> 36:50.499
Thank you. Perfect. Let me know
if you hear anything else.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.585
Where the hell you been?

36:52.668 --> 36:54.170
Figuring this
whole thing out.

36:54.253 --> 36:55.588
I know who it is.

36:55.671 --> 36:56.672
The buyer.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.341
His name is Lawrence Wilcott
and he's been working

36:58.424 --> 36:59.926
for the Company for ten years.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.177
How did you figure that out?

37:01.260 --> 37:02.345
I still have friends
on the inside,

37:02.428 --> 37:04.096
and on the outside
of the Company.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.348
I've been putting
together a profile,

37:05.431 --> 37:06.891
narrowing down
the candidates.

37:06.974 --> 37:08.142
Wilcott got on a plane

37:08.226 --> 37:10.269
in Bogotá and flew
to the Bahamas yesterday

37:10.353 --> 37:12.230
and then got on a boat.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.481
The guy who took Scylla
off us in L.A.?

37:13.564 --> 37:14.732
We pulled his image
off the security tape.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.360
Company's running a
recognition match right now.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.569
That's great, but
that's going to take all day.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.821
Do you know where
he is right now? With Wilcott.

37:20.905 --> 37:21.864
We need to go now.

37:21.948 --> 37:22.990
Because better yet,

37:23.074 --> 37:25.243
I know where
Wilcott's staying.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.869
Okay, we need to move
before Scylla does.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.871
Let's go.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.165
Let's go.
Come on.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.458
Nice job.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.872
♪ ♪

38:16.085 --> 38:17.795
Turn around!

38:17.878 --> 38:19.839
Hands on your head.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.471
Punch it, we gotta get out of here!

38:31.225 --> 38:33.394
Michael, get in!

38:40.526 --> 38:43.195
He's rented out the entire top floor.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.406
Security at every point.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.534
We might want to get
to an employee-- bribe one.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.870
Top level company
in a big glass building.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.123
Nice and slow.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.751
Get your hands up.

39:03.841 --> 39:04.800
This is everyone?

39:04.884 --> 39:06.385
You whore.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.179
You're a whore,

39:08.262 --> 39:10.056
and your mother
was a whore,

39:10.139 --> 39:11.432
and her mother,
and your father

39:11.515 --> 39:13.851
used to turn tricks
at a gas station,

39:13.934 --> 39:15.478
'cause he was a whore, too.

39:17.813 --> 39:19.982
Bye, Auntie.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.284
Sorry, but right now
I want my life back

39:30.368 --> 39:31.702
more than I want your money.

39:33.913 --> 39:34.914
Where's Scylla?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.792
Well, let's talk
about that, okay?

39:37.875 --> 39:39.043
Let's. Where is it?

39:39.126 --> 39:40.795
I can get it.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.046
No, he can't.

39:42.129 --> 39:44.799
He's stalling, Linc. It's gone.

39:44.882 --> 39:45.925
You're right.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.468
Since all you guys
can kiss my ass,

39:47.551 --> 39:49.720
there's only one thing I want
to accomplish right now.

39:56.602 --> 39:59.146
Lawrence Wilcott?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.524
The whole floor of
the hotel rented out?

40:01.607 --> 40:03.359
Made it up.

40:03.442 --> 40:06.028
You have no idea
who this guy is working for?

40:06.112 --> 40:08.114
No.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.949
No clue.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.450
We gotta pull the
pin here, guys.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.202
Just because she switched
sides at the last second

40:13.285 --> 40:16.622
doesn't mean she wasn't going to
kill us two minutes ago, okay?

40:20.376 --> 40:22.336
Kill her. All right, we're
not leaving her here

40:22.420 --> 40:24.171
for the cops and we're
not taking her

40:24.255 --> 40:27.007
to the hospital.
Why?

40:27.091 --> 40:28.676
I didn't let you
get slaughtered.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.678
She's got a kid.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.929
So what?

40:32.012 --> 40:33.264
Are we killing the kid?

40:33.347 --> 40:34.348
The kid doesn't even
know it's her mother.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.891
Come on, Linc,
pull the trigger. Do it.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.143
Her name's Emily--

40:37.226 --> 40:38.769
she's only eight years old.
Come on.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.358
Do it.

40:48.904 --> 40:52.032
We're not them.

40:54.618 --> 40:55.619
You keep your mouth shut,

40:55.703 --> 40:57.329
and you get to see your kid
in visitation.

40:59.373 --> 41:01.834
I know what the General will do
to me if I talk in prison.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.044
Believe me.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.254
I know him well.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.260
Are you serious?

41:11.427 --> 41:13.846
Go. Let's go, let's go.

41:44.543 --> 41:45.920
What happened?

41:49.924 --> 41:51.300
You haven't said a word.

41:58.265 --> 42:00.768
I think my mother's alive.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.745
That's his cell phone. Answer it.

42:25.125 --> 42:26.168
Hello.

42:28.629 --> 42:30.130
Hello.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.470
Your boy's dead.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.847
And now I'm coming after you.

42:39.598 --> 42:41.684
Did you hear me?

42:41.767 --> 42:46.313
Whoever you are,
I'm coming after you.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.207
Who was that?

43:06.875 --> 43:10.087
It was my son--

43:10.170 --> 43:11.922
Lincoln.
