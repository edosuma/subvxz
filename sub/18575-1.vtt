01:43.520 --> 01:44.633
Hey, you're home.

01:44.936 --> 01:45.806
Oh? Yes

01:48.161 --> 01:48.906
Thanks.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.365
You are welcome!

01:52.235 --> 01:55.227
Don't want to come up?
- You can have a coffee or a drink.

01:55.228 --> 01:58.203
- You need to put on your thinking cap
you have a presentation to write.

01:58.204 --> 01:59.814
Oh, don't remind me.

02:00.182 --> 02:01.086
Good night.

02:06.851 --> 02:07.617
Debbie?

02:08.433 --> 02:09.163
Yes?

02:11.937 --> 02:12.807
See you tomorrow.

03:09.410 --> 03:11.323
Yes?
I can help you?

03:13.019 --> 03:15.158
Are you James Ferguson?

03:15.586 --> 03:16.692
Yes, and who are you?

03:17.007 --> 03:21.498
May I be so bold...
ask to require if you are all blessed?

03:21.752 --> 03:23.387
I'm fine.
Why?

03:24.321 --> 03:27.701
Nothing strange happened to you
in the past few minutes?

03:28.054 --> 03:29.429
Nothing, except you!

03:29.685 --> 03:31.058
What do you want?

03:32.591 --> 03:33.601
May I come in?

03:34.239 --> 03:35.755
Not unless you  have the right speach.

03:36.199 --> 03:38.148
I get a lot of work to do.
I'm sorry, but no.

03:40.002 --> 03:43.486
Do you have the correct time?

03:45.389 --> 03:47.129
Is 23: 16h exactly.

03:48.831 --> 03:50.571
23: 16h exactly?

03:51.879 --> 03:54.709
Must be a mistake.
I should have happened by now.

03:55.137 --> 03:55.984
I tell you what...,

03:56.919 --> 03:58.903
I'm very busy and I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:58.904 --> 04:01.315
So why did I just....go?
OK?

04:02.474 --> 04:04.982
- I'm sorry to have
troubled you, Mr. Ferguson.

04:07.367 --> 04:08.306
Goodbye.

04:09.744 --> 04:10.683
Okay...

04:14.801 --> 04:15.915
Weird!

04:19.398 --> 04:21.827
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Jim Ferguson

04:22.123 --> 04:25.299
and the President of "Celebrities Dinner"
gave me the greatest pleasure...

04:25.748 --> 04:26.917
to welcome them here today,

04:26.918 --> 04:28.136
and celebrate with us. ..

04:29.529 --> 04:34.211
the revelling...
of our first ever line of TV star in...

05:21.378 --> 05:22.352
Hello?

05:23.543 --> 05:24.359
Hello?

05:25.087 --> 05:29.119
I'm dead?
I took a hell of a fall, old man.

05:30.195 --> 05:32.507
It seems very strange
get under my plane.

05:33.235 --> 05:34.589
Are you kidding me?

05:36.206 --> 05:37.557
Now head along, will you?

05:37.558 --> 05:39.946
They will start a whistle
bangs in a moment.

05:48.106 --> 05:49.010
Let's move!

06:08.576 --> 06:09.446
Damn it!

06:09.998 --> 06:11.215
I lost the bloody camera...

06:12.796 --> 06:14.917
I shall start tomorrow
and do it again!

06:18.093 --> 06:19.572
Thanks for your help.

06:20.537 --> 06:22.726
I think we were not properly introduced...

06:23.677 --> 06:27.952
I'm James Bigglesworth.
My friends call me Biggles.

06:29.131 --> 06:30.801
Jim Ferguson.

06:33.488 --> 06:35.088
Celebrity Dinners...

06:36.981 --> 06:41.154
Do say...
You are an american!

06:42.093 --> 06:43.781
I heard you chaps
were coming over.

06:44.545 --> 06:46.405
Uniforms are the
way, I suppose?

06:49.358 --> 06:51.526
The Germans had fixed us.
Come on!

06:53.996 --> 06:56.080
Wait.
This is ridiculous.

06:56.370 --> 06:59.088
What the hell is going on?

07:48.240 --> 07:50.612
Hey, take a look at that guy!

07:53.402 --> 07:54.247
Hi!

08:12.513 --> 08:13.552
Good morning, Judy.

08:13.765 --> 08:15.707
Here they sent to meet them...

08:18.409 --> 08:19.598
I know, sorry.
I'm late...

08:19.624 --> 08:20.538
What happened to you?

08:20.885 --> 08:23.077
I bumped in to the doors. Nothing much.
Are you ready for the 1st. assault?

08:23.302 --> 08:25.907
First I would like to go to the final costs
and the figures with you.

08:26.002 --> 08:27.529
and we have a "slight" problem
with our trailers.

08:27.639 --> 08:29.910
It is ridiculous! You would not pay to see that...

08:30.773 --> 08:32.129
Look the girl breasts.

08:32.130 --> 08:34.659
Jim! Jim
we need this cover.

08:34.686 --> 08:36.933
It is modern, has style and is sexy!

08:37.082 --> 08:39.962
it's what young americans are about today.
And that's on TV!

08:40.030 --> 08:42.248
Maybe check it,
but not too much.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.730
- I'll be with you in a second...
- Right.

08:49.639 --> 08:53.228
Yes It looks almost good
enough to eat, huh?

08:53.730 --> 08:55.476
Looks fantastic!

08:58.488 --> 09:00.814
Take these to finalize and send
moment on.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.031
Right.
Thank you!

09:02.487 --> 09:04.203
Oh, Jim! I could talk
with you for a minute?

09:04.300 --> 09:05.344
About checking?

09:05.932 --> 09:09.342
Hey I bother you with something
that isn't important?

09:10.209 --> 09:11.078
What you have in mind?

09:11.665 --> 09:13.533
The girl on the package...

09:14.119 --> 09:17.194
She is part of my campaign
for a new product.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.425
Starlet Snacks!

09:21.256 --> 09:23.509
See, every cover is a photo
of a gorgeous girl...

09:23.575 --> 09:25.724
gladly posing,
in provocative positions.

09:25.839 --> 09:28.343
We may advertise
on the Playboy Channel!

09:28.767 --> 09:29.811
So what do you think?

09:30.444 --> 09:33.206
"Pinch" Starlet today to one night...

09:33.208 --> 09:34.742
We talked about it more
afternoon in his office.

09:34.837 --> 09:37.425
Jim... when you gonna dump
that numb shit?

09:37.426 --> 09:38.839
Jack get some good ideas,

09:38.840 --> 09:41.284
and as long as his uncle runs a Bank
that gives us a loan...

09:41.310 --> 09:42.785
he is married with us!

09:42.921 --> 09:44.278
Try to live with it, right?

09:44.572 --> 09:46.951
Look, try to keep control
class only for today,

09:46.962 --> 09:48.944
I want everyone
there, you know !?

09:49.278 --> 09:51.157
OK! But I can't do everything.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.547
What do you mean by not
can do everything?

09:52.548 --> 09:53.418
You gonna have to!

09:53.726 --> 09:55.286
Look Jimmy,
is the big day!

09:55.344 --> 09:56.736
So cool, okay?

09:58.677 --> 10:00.687
Now you sure. Everything is
ready for the lunch?

10:03.424 --> 10:04.318
Debbie,

10:04.788 --> 10:07.097
just give me a moment
with this man, right?

10:08.049 --> 10:09.666
Just will be a moment. I promise.

10:17.263 --> 10:19.263
I see you hurt your head.

10:19.914 --> 10:21.549
Did it happened last night?

10:22.046 --> 10:23.596
What is this?
20 Questions?

10:24.025 --> 10:25.475
Did you knock your head?

10:25.587 --> 10:26.770
... On a burning plane?

10:29.714 --> 10:31.194
Why did you say that?

10:31.870 --> 10:34.432
Did you rescue the pilot?

10:36.043 --> 10:37.330
Who the hell are you?

10:37.936 --> 10:40.113
And that did really happened last night!

10:40.344 --> 10:41.671
You have to tell me...

10:41.805 --> 10:44.275
It is important to tell me
exactly what happened.

10:45.213 --> 10:46.487
Commander Raymond...

10:47.033 --> 10:48.367
Air Intelligence !?

10:48.487 --> 10:49.801
Are you investigating me?

10:49.836 --> 10:51.712
No! Nothing like that. Go on.

10:51.713 --> 10:52.902
You must to tell me!

10:54.004 --> 10:54.560
Right.

10:57.013 --> 10:59.591
I was in my living room,
trying to write a speech...

11:00.716 --> 11:03.936
Next thing I knew I was in the middle
of a bigbattle somewhere.

11:04.017 --> 11:06.452
The Western Front, 1917!

11:07.244 --> 11:09.366
- How do you know that?
- Please go on.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.611
The plane crashed.
Was a old biplane.

11:14.072 --> 11:15.502
I helped the pilot get out.

11:15.559 --> 11:18.055
You saved him...
You saved Biggles?

11:18.277 --> 11:19.580
Biggles, that's right.

11:20.483 --> 11:21.622
Please continue.

11:22.005 --> 11:24.884
There was lot of shooting and bombing...
and the plane blew up!

11:26.282 --> 11:28.362
So I was sited back in
my room somewhere.

11:28.363 --> 11:30.544
This really sounds crazy, I know!

11:30.859 --> 11:32.086
What about the camera?

11:32.406 --> 11:33.046
Camera?

11:33.167 --> 11:34.751
The camera on the aircraft.

11:34.936 --> 11:36.827
Did Biggles retrived it?

11:37.698 --> 11:40.081
No, the plane blew up before
he can pull the camera.

11:42.609 --> 11:44.175
That's very awkward!

11:44.763 --> 11:46.964
Listen to Mr. Raymond,
who ever the hell you are...

11:46.983 --> 11:49.308
Do you mind telling me
what is going on here ?!

11:49.612 --> 11:52.499
Jim, we got a glitch
with mashed potatoes.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.366
Just a minute, Bill.
Please...

11:56.357 --> 11:58.556
Something else will happen to you.

11:58.750 --> 11:59.961
You must come to London.

12:00.111 --> 12:01.866
London?
You're crazy?

12:01.867 --> 12:03.485
My address is on the card.

12:04.518 --> 12:07.215
Good day, Mr. Ferguson.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.101
Looks a spring on that step, hum?

12:24.653 --> 12:25.587
What do you think?

12:25.588 --> 12:26.573
OK so far...

12:26.574 --> 12:28.279
... but national market
just arrived!

12:28.675 --> 12:30.273
Oh God!
My tie is right?

12:30.289 --> 12:30.814
Yes!

12:31.059 --> 12:31.751
- My head is on?

12:31.752 --> 12:32.877
Yes, you look great!

12:33.196 --> 12:34.751
- Wish me luck.
- You will need.

12:34.752 --> 12:36.143
It is Maxine Fine!

12:40.548 --> 12:41.487
Misses Fine...

12:42.269 --> 12:44.153
It is great to see it!
Oh, you're looking good!

12:44.461 --> 12:45.157
Thanks for coming.

12:45.370 --> 12:46.413
Oh, hello Ferguson.

12:47.120 --> 12:47.854
So...

12:48.284 --> 12:49.568
is this it?

12:51.416 --> 12:52.878
Breaking into the big time, huh?

12:53.539 --> 12:55.243
I think we got the
product to it.

12:56.482 --> 12:57.573
Well, we'll see...

12:59.531 --> 13:02.357
What are you selling here?
Silicone implants?

13:02.797 --> 13:03.806
Oh, you mean the cover...

13:03.864 --> 13:07.063
There is a market research for her.
We will replace it with a new one.

13:10.198 --> 13:12.702
Hum! Not much nose!

13:13.512 --> 13:15.707
Consumers want a lot
of nose in their dinner.

13:15.884 --> 13:17.311
We certainly are
working on that.

13:19.555 --> 13:20.607
What the hell...?

13:20.710 --> 13:22.462
Let me get you
another dinner.

13:22.790 --> 13:25.334
No, it's okay.
Someone will gonna need it.

13:25.829 --> 13:27.826
I'm not too sure about
to the creamed corn.

13:28.123 --> 13:29.828
If looks a bit like...

13:30.400 --> 13:31.410
Dog puke!?

13:32.627 --> 13:33.462
Misses Fine...

13:34.200 --> 13:39.565
You know your customers will tell you,
this is the finest dog puke they ever tasted.

13:51.755 --> 13:52.764
You again?

13:54.249 --> 13:56.654
- What the juice you're doing on my plane?
- I do not know.

13:58.006 --> 13:59.575
You signed to the wrong plane.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.870
This can be a one-way mission.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.441
What do you mean...

14:06.575 --> 14:07.592
"one-way"?

14:09.631 --> 14:10.987
The Germans have a new weapon.

14:11.648 --> 14:13.004
One that caused me to crash.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.709
I'll gonna try taking another photograph.

14:17.463 --> 14:19.558
They may try to use the weapon against us.

14:20.251 --> 14:21.747
Make yourself useful!

14:23.253 --> 14:24.887
Put the helmet when
in the cockpit.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.723
Biggles, I have to talk to you.

14:32.244 --> 14:34.297
Don't talk!
Look!

14:36.606 --> 14:37.685
Look for what?

15:53.166 --> 15:54.455
Get on the gun!

16:48.476 --> 16:49.832
Shoot back in him!

17:22.441 --> 17:24.095
The gun jammed!

17:24.468 --> 17:26.523
What are you jamming?!

17:27.390 --> 17:28.782
You have to out running!

17:46.035 --> 17:48.051
What did they train you for?

17:48.684 --> 17:49.584
Cooking!

18:15.321 --> 18:18.162
Hey, I did it!
He is gone!

19:04.408 --> 19:05.904
I got the photograph!

19:20.203 --> 19:21.956
What's wrong with the plane?

19:22.259 --> 19:24.141
It is the same as before!

19:25.520 --> 19:27.469
They're using the weapon!

19:45.601 --> 19:48.348
I'll try more altitude!

19:49.004 --> 19:50.903
Best to hold!

19:59.103 --> 20:00.031
We did it!

20:00.858 --> 20:03.724
Whatever it was,
we're out of range!

20:09.469 --> 20:10.597
Take over!

20:10.971 --> 20:12.671
Take over what?

20:13.783 --> 20:15.315
The controls!

20:16.070 --> 20:17.950
Just hold on steady!

20:43.271 --> 20:44.315
I take over now!

21:40.689 --> 21:42.777
Come, come and stop!

22:07.035 --> 22:08.322
Beware the picture !!!

22:14.592 --> 22:16.704
- Jim, what happened to you?
- Diane, I can not explain!

22:16.855 --> 22:18.160
Please tell me what's going on!

22:18.161 --> 22:21.010
- Just stay away from me. Stay away!
- Where are you going?

22:21.259 --> 22:23.137
- To London!
- London?

23:20.142 --> 23:21.116
Come in!

23:27.155 --> 23:29.452
I wasn't expecting you Mr. Ferguson.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.769
This is my lair, as I called it...

23:43.012 --> 23:44.437
It is not a Cozy, don't you think?

23:44.887 --> 23:47.532
Of course when they raised
the bridge was a bit noisy.

23:47.533 --> 23:48.722
But that is not very often.

23:49.326 --> 23:50.629
Please sit down.

23:50.751 --> 23:51.438
I'll get some tea.

23:51.527 --> 23:54.764
Forget tea! Do you mind tell me
what the hell is going on here !?

23:55.625 --> 23:58.217
I got a business to run.
People relying on me!

23:58.399 --> 24:00.320
What the hell are you
are up to, or why!?

24:00.497 --> 24:03.027
But it has to stop. Did you hear me?
I want to stop!

24:03.176 --> 24:05.125
Mr. Ferguson, please do not cry.

24:06.199 --> 24:07.521
Why did you stick me with this !?

24:08.147 --> 24:10.702
If I had to "stick" someone with this ...

24:10.703 --> 24:12.895
Certainly I would not have picked you.

24:13.601 --> 24:14.907
Fight for your country...

24:15.218 --> 24:18.558
and their life is something
you never had to do...

24:19.482 --> 24:20.909
That's where you're wrong, pal!

24:21.251 --> 24:22.684
Last escapade I was on...

24:22.993 --> 24:26.345
I was shot from some
black hooded clown a German biplane.

24:27.016 --> 24:30.103
Von Stalhein,
had to be!

24:30.581 --> 24:32.103
I want some answers!

24:32.458 --> 24:33.606
Now!

24:34.207 --> 24:35.785
Please Mr. Ferguson

24:36.177 --> 24:38.481
Sit down in this very good chair and
I'll tell you what I know.

24:39.861 --> 24:42.394
The man you met
is James Bigglesworth.

24:43.143 --> 24:45.547
This is a photograph of him with his team...

24:46.280 --> 24:47.881
Algy, Bertie and Ginger.

24:48.892 --> 24:50.452
What is these guys?
A Novel act?

24:50.994 --> 24:51.960
They did not!

24:52.804 --> 24:56.014
They're before the bravest men
I have had the privilege of know.

24:56.606 --> 24:59.984
Your enjoyment of freedom depended
men like them.

25:00.076 --> 25:01.785
Yes?
And what does this have to do with me?

25:03.680 --> 25:06.156
You gave this card to Biggles...

25:09.376 --> 25:11.289
How in the hell did you get this?

25:11.554 --> 25:12.942
Biggles gave it to me.

25:13.519 --> 25:16.317
You see... I was his commander Officer,
on the Western Front.

25:17.626 --> 25:20.096
But I just gave this card to Biggles
two nights ago...

25:20.864 --> 25:22.513
You mean that was in 1917?

25:23.634 --> 25:25.408
Time travel is not
unknown in history.

25:26.513 --> 25:29.609
There is evidence that it
happened more often than any suspect.

25:30.264 --> 25:31.691
But why me?

25:31.896 --> 25:34.262
I don't know the details of it.
Only when it happens.

25:35.128 --> 25:37.247
And how I keep meeting
Biggles than?

25:37.950 --> 25:39.294
Is hypothetical...

25:39.940 --> 25:42.342
I think Biggles is
your "Time Twin".

25:43.105 --> 25:44.775
"Time Twin"...?

25:46.756 --> 25:48.564
Listen, you  have something
stronger than tea?

25:49.668 --> 25:53.509
It seems like an hour to your life
is intrinsically linked to it.

25:53.810 --> 25:55.167
Do you think maybe...?

25:56.031 --> 25:57.739
The reason has something to do with it?

25:59.457 --> 26:00.668
Where did you get this?

26:02.344 --> 26:06.142
The second time I went  back, Biggles
and I were in a photo recon mission, and...

26:06.562 --> 26:08.475
when I returned, I was holding this thing.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.269
Did Biggles tell you what
that photography is?

26:12.861 --> 26:14.845
Yes! Some sort of secret weapon.

26:15.896 --> 26:17.702
Biggles seemed very
concerned about it.

26:20.606 --> 26:22.590
I think this photograph is...

26:24.898 --> 26:25.924
Mr. Ferguson...

26:27.898 --> 26:29.185
The time is come for action!

26:29.728 --> 26:30.627
What kind of action?

26:30.851 --> 26:32.595
I prepared something for you.

26:33.715 --> 26:34.223
What for?

26:34.709 --> 26:36.351
On next trip back...

26:38.517 --> 26:39.287
This time...

26:39.710 --> 26:42.653
we'll send you to the
battlefield properly equipped.

26:43.205 --> 26:45.321
Listen. Is there any
way I get out of this?

26:45.347 --> 26:46.308
I'm afraid not.

26:46.637 --> 26:50.492
If the enemy has developed a weapon
that alows then to break true the Allied lines,

26:51.438 --> 26:53.372
Germany can well win
the first World War.

26:53.950 --> 26:55.197
History will be altered...

26:55.596 --> 26:59.769
and you will be stuck in 1917
until the time reaches.

27:01.134 --> 27:02.839
And God knows what will
happen with the rest of us.

27:04.696 --> 27:06.401
This is getting crazy,
you know !?

27:06.430 --> 27:07.556
You must not fail!

27:08.177 --> 27:11.573
I have arrangements for you to stay in a hotel,
just across the river.

27:11.768 --> 27:12.861
The "Tower Hotel".

27:13.003 --> 27:15.708
Now I'll have this plate processed
 to the contact be done.

27:16.295 --> 27:17.165
Good luck.

27:22.132 --> 27:23.420
You'll be in good hands!

27:25.551 --> 27:27.187
Biggles is a fine officer!

27:35.063 --> 27:37.955
I really do not understand what
make act like that...

27:38.361 --> 27:40.444
Psychosys Trauma!

27:41.318 --> 27:42.676
Says alright here.

27:46.026 --> 27:47.556
"Diseases of the Mind"?

27:47.591 --> 27:50.479
I've been reading all night,
and I found the answer...

27:51.079 --> 27:53.549
Psychosys Trauma Syndrome!

27:54.088 --> 27:55.344
Jim is not crazy.

27:55.345 --> 27:56.439
He's scared!

27:56.664 --> 27:59.241
There's something to do with the man who
came to see him yesterday.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.713
I'm afraid of some kind of blackmail or...

28:03.979 --> 28:05.567
Hello?
Is Jim!

28:06.719 --> 28:07.950
Where are you?

28:08.379 --> 28:10.867
I'm at "The Tower Hotel" in London.

28:11.098 --> 28:12.717
Tell me what's the news?

28:12.718 --> 28:15.797
We are in business.
Maxine Fine made a big order.

28:16.696 --> 28:17.601
That's great!

28:18.556 --> 28:21.140
- I'm coming home in a few days.
- What's going on?

28:21.489 --> 28:23.889
It's personal, honey!
I mean, I can handle it.

28:24.165 --> 28:25.843
Look, I can be on the next plane...

28:25.953 --> 28:27.684
Debbie listen to me...
NO WAY!

28:27.741 --> 28:30.471
Absolutely not.
I'll be home in a few days.

28:31.601 --> 28:32.715
I promise you.

28:33.075 --> 28:34.815
Just Say hi to the gang for me.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.474
You see?
Guys like Jim,

28:40.601 --> 28:43.767
pushed over the limit, and
store stress.

28:44.282 --> 28:47.872
And builds up, and builds
inside him until they just...

28:47.873 --> 28:48.418
Snap!

28:50.771 --> 28:51.767
I'm going to London.

28:51.768 --> 28:53.133
- I'm going with you!
- Me too!

28:54.216 --> 28:56.653
No Bill, someone has to stay
here and handle the orders.

28:56.913 --> 28:58.160
You can not go over there alone.

28:58.597 --> 28:59.606
I take Chuck.

29:03.069 --> 29:04.947
Jim is as good as cured.

29:08.254 --> 29:09.755
Keep it tie ass hole!

29:57.549 --> 30:00.655
Excuse me sir, I didn't see you there.

30:01.852 --> 30:03.615
I'll come back later.

30:46.249 --> 30:47.745
Is Jesus Christ?

30:48.634 --> 30:50.058
Biggles?
Where is he?

30:50.414 --> 30:51.535
He got to be here.

30:54.050 --> 30:55.094
Biggles!

30:56.985 --> 30:58.133
Does it ring a bell?

31:16.720 --> 31:17.714
Who are you?

31:17.853 --> 31:18.968
You are Belgian?

31:19.525 --> 31:21.020
I'm not Belgian.
I'm Jim Ferguson.

31:22.089 --> 31:23.189
Oh, an American?

31:24.379 --> 31:25.593
You Bertie, right?

31:27.664 --> 31:29.913
Algy?
Ginger?

31:30.821 --> 31:32.960
I'm not so good on faces, but
monocles I never forget...

31:32.961 --> 31:34.841
- How did you get here?
- You would not believe...

31:36.263 --> 31:37.132
- Try us

31:38.073 --> 31:39.608
- I fell through a
hole in time.

31:40.026 --> 31:41.858
You can do better than that.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.430
It's the truth!

31:44.044 --> 31:48.247
You have 3 seconds:
1... 2...

31:48.963 --> 31:49.760
OK!

31:50.645 --> 31:52.478
I'm an American secret agent.

31:53.105 --> 31:54.605
Where is your identification?

31:55.772 --> 31:56.970
You don't want to see it...

31:57.672 --> 31:59.900
Come on, You know, you know.
Carring identification?

31:59.901 --> 32:01.761
Why are you
wearing a towel?

32:01.967 --> 32:04.019
Because I was taking a bath.

32:06.997 --> 32:08.145
Release him!

32:14.004 --> 32:15.218
What have you done
with my photography?

32:15.625 --> 32:16.583
Has been developed.

32:17.594 --> 32:19.615
For now my orders
are to help you guys.

32:19.824 --> 32:20.773
Anyway I can.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.340
With 10 miles behind enemy lines?

32:24.031 --> 32:26.850
We are here to meet someone
with information about the German weapon.

32:27.294 --> 32:30.701
We can start by getting some cloth, please?
It's freezing here!

32:51.697 --> 32:52.869
Do you know each other?

32:53.470 --> 32:54.075
Yes!

32:55.925 --> 32:56.991
Have we met.

33:12.466 --> 33:14.572
- Marie!
- Who is Marie?

33:14.943 --> 33:17.053
She a girl Biggles met back in 1916.

33:17.784 --> 33:19.208
Seems  she was a German agent.

33:19.702 --> 33:22.581
And tried trick Biggles, in to carrying
messages by the lines.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.626
She fell in love with him...

33:24.819 --> 33:26.767
and double cross her
own side to save his neck.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.683
Now both sides want in
front of the firing squad.

33:32.000 --> 33:32.755
Don't worry...

33:33.622 --> 33:35.326
Biggles won't be take in twice.

33:35.846 --> 33:38.212
I have maps in case
you lead to Blanch Fleur,

33:38.593 --> 33:40.594
It was there that they discovered the bodies.

33:41.429 --> 33:43.015
What you know
what is in Blanch Fleur?

33:43.460 --> 33:44.978
No one ever seen it.

33:45.591 --> 33:46.942
I mean, what she does.

33:47.850 --> 33:48.789
Here is the map.

33:57.492 --> 33:58.806
You can trust me, James.

33:59.655 --> 34:01.156
You must believe me!

34:02.078 --> 34:04.152
I neither working for
either side any longer!

34:20.766 --> 34:22.158
Do not become a nun...

34:24.268 --> 34:25.311
yet...

34:26.643 --> 34:29.009
I haven't... yet!

34:30.782 --> 34:32.962
When this is over I'll come
back to you, I promise!

34:37.864 --> 34:39.013
You must hurry!

34:53.728 --> 34:55.100
Germans everywhere!

34:56.054 --> 34:57.076
They cornered us.

34:57.254 --> 34:58.091
Came from all sides!

34:58.188 --> 34:59.960
They must had the whole place
under surveillance.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.635
We been betrayed.

35:06.097 --> 35:07.745
We can not fight here.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.416
Not with all these people!

36:00.885 --> 36:02.728
Captain Eric Von Stalhein.

36:05.365 --> 36:07.298
So famous Biggles!

36:07.713 --> 36:10.784
At last we meet,
face to face!

36:11.405 --> 36:13.465
Haven't you forgotten your
iron mask?

36:14.129 --> 36:16.634
I do not use to catch a spy!

36:17.865 --> 36:21.856
Or perhaps you came to this nunnery
to take holy orders?

36:22.611 --> 36:24.194
Nothing of that, old chap.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.397
I just sing in the choir.

36:27.231 --> 36:29.719
Choir pratices is canceled today!

36:35.862 --> 36:37.602
Just for curiosity...

36:39.736 --> 36:41.336
How did you know I was here?

36:44.584 --> 36:48.265
One of our patrols spoted your
plane landing before the daybreak.

36:49.392 --> 36:50.644
When they told me...

36:51.196 --> 36:56.909
an english plane had made a night landing
and taxied across a narrow bridge...

36:57.302 --> 36:58.015
... I knew!

37:00.051 --> 37:02.628
It could only be the great Biggles.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.807
To the Gods of War!

37:12.251 --> 37:13.538
To peace!

37:15.828 --> 37:20.091
I'd rather finish you
myself. In the air!

37:20.402 --> 37:23.484
So, firing squad will not
be nearly as enjoyable.

37:23.925 --> 37:26.639
But at least their bullets
will do the job.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.164
Take him!

37:56.335 --> 37:57.239
Attention!

38:02.967 --> 38:03.837
Aim!

38:07.270 --> 38:08.348
Granada!

38:16.715 --> 38:18.786
Don't you move!
Stay there!

38:22.612 --> 38:26.341
Tell them not to move, or
I'll be the first to hit the wings!

38:34.459 --> 38:36.546
I will not put a bullet in your head
old man...

38:37.526 --> 38:39.802
Because that's not the way we do business.

38:52.962 --> 38:54.145
Thank you, Sister!

39:03.906 --> 39:06.534
Jim is Debbie!
Are you all right?

39:09.480 --> 39:10.176
Jim?

39:11.109 --> 39:12.084
What are you doing here?

39:14.359 --> 39:14.776
Jim?

39:18.494 --> 39:19.364
Can I come in?

39:20.214 --> 39:21.223
Can you wait a minute?

39:27.020 --> 39:28.899
He became a transvestite!

39:29.962 --> 39:31.910
What are you wearing a dress and a hat for?

39:32.587 --> 39:33.944
I told you it was personal.

39:37.493 --> 39:40.905
Oh! A transvestite bank robber!
That is not even in the book!

39:41.350 --> 39:43.929
Now listen both of you.
Has a very good explanation for all this.

39:44.114 --> 39:45.401
I sure hope so.

40:01.613 --> 40:06.259
This is Dr. Charles Winthrop Dinsmore
in the lobby.

40:06.670 --> 40:09.065
I am a psychiatrist from New York city.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.005
One of my patients is
staying with you and...

40:12.755 --> 40:15.292
I'm afraid I need
a little help with him...

40:15.682 --> 40:19.030
If you can arrange an ambulance
I'll be most grateful.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.114
He's in room 1231.

40:21.768 --> 40:26.002
And a couple of good
strong attendants, too...

40:27.042 --> 40:28.355
Is your patient dangerous?

40:28.622 --> 40:30.807
Of course not!

40:31.052 --> 40:35.922
It's just a little confused.
He is wearing nun's dress and...

40:35.923 --> 40:37.041
has a gun...

40:37.839 --> 40:39.081
Did you said a gun?

40:39.496 --> 40:43.963
Yeah...
just a normal big gun.

40:46.281 --> 40:47.817
Jim, want you please tell me
what is going on...?

40:47.818 --> 40:50.055
Okay Debbie, but I'm telling you,
no one will ever believe it.

40:50.319 --> 40:53.908
I keep falling through this hole in time
going back to 1917.

40:54.745 --> 40:55.545
Go on!

40:56.848 --> 40:57.914
Do you believe me?

40:58.178 --> 41:00.570
Well, if you say so, Jim.
I guess I believe.

41:00.571 --> 41:03.006
Debbie, I keep going back
to World War one...

41:03.872 --> 41:08.527
Where I'm helping a guy named Biggles
to find and destroy a German secret weapon.

41:12.446 --> 41:13.037
Come on.

41:22.430 --> 41:23.580
I'm Dr. Dinsmore.

41:23.833 --> 41:26.771
Oh yes, sir. Duman
has a pass for you.

41:27.165 --> 41:28.220
Jim, listen please...

41:28.228 --> 41:31.998
I'm not saying do not believe you
about going back in the past and everything...

41:31.999 --> 41:34.172
- Will you promise me one thing...
- What?

41:34.323 --> 41:35.362
- We will try to get help!

41:35.363 --> 41:36.768
- They are, that's what
we're going to the tower bridge for.

41:37.170 --> 41:39.588
Could you cut the bridge history?
I mean real help!

41:40.120 --> 41:41.143
Psychiatric help...

41:43.419 --> 41:44.914
You just said you believe in me!

41:45.873 --> 41:49.186
Look... I'm sure all
this is very real to you!

41:49.754 --> 41:50.519
But...

41:51.762 --> 41:52.423
Oh, shit!

41:53.054 --> 41:54.202
Come on, do not have much time!

41:54.576 --> 41:57.601
You have to believe me!
I am a psychiatrist!

41:58.111 --> 42:00.965
I do not want to hurt anyone,
was just helping a friend...

42:00.966 --> 42:02.628
Hey, that's him!

42:07.815 --> 42:09.485
Debbie, stay away!
You got to stay away.

42:16.501 --> 42:17.332
In here!

42:22.323 --> 42:23.167
Stay down!

42:46.552 --> 42:47.804
God, Ferguson!

42:49.059 --> 42:50.015
Pinch me!

42:50.358 --> 42:51.976
is the American chap!

42:54.082 --> 42:55.286
Good God !?

42:55.663 --> 42:57.705
Captain Bigglesworth,
this is Debbie Stevens...

42:58.082 --> 43:00.586
my... nurse.

43:02.271 --> 43:05.164
Shouldn't be here Miss. Stevens,
is no place for a lady.

43:10.153 --> 43:11.058
Come on, move!

43:27.571 --> 43:29.652
We will be near the tunnel
in seconds.

43:29.767 --> 43:30.843
Stay close and behind me!

43:32.468 --> 43:36.197
- We connected to the cave system, sir.
- Don't you mind be in safe?

43:36.535 --> 43:37.892
Please, moving!

43:37.900 --> 43:39.432
In the cave, quickly!

43:42.820 --> 43:46.613
Jim, tell me this is some kind of bad
dream, or maybe something you fixed up!

43:50.561 --> 43:54.132
Believe me now? I told you,
I keep going back to 1917.

43:54.143 --> 43:56.812
OK. We'll come back?
Or go forward?

44:08.381 --> 44:09.564
Come on, Ferguson!

44:43.143 --> 44:45.091
Jim, this is all like a
TV show, isn't it?

44:45.467 --> 44:46.644
Like "Fantasy Island", right?

44:46.670 --> 44:49.024
Come on Debbie, is not so bad.
It's only the World War One.

44:49.827 --> 44:51.714
Yow Biggles, hold on a second here!

44:52.177 --> 44:53.290
Do you mind tell me the plan?

44:53.453 --> 44:56.455
We go to this place Blanche Fleur,
the one Marie gave me the map.

44:56.690 --> 44:58.534
We got to find out what
kind of weapon they have.

44:58.746 --> 44:59.920
This is the big offensive!

45:00.103 --> 45:02.119
I think it's a matter of hours
before they use it!

45:18.763 --> 45:20.572
Oh! I think we gonna get fail.

45:25.816 --> 45:28.211
I know this is some
kind of hallucination...

45:28.743 --> 45:32.043
... and this got to be those mushrooms
I ate on the plane.

45:39.191 --> 45:41.599
Algy, that's too many "Celebrities Dinners" for you!

45:42.440 --> 45:43.309
Stay close!

45:44.077 --> 45:44.947
What out now...

46:08.388 --> 46:10.391
Supposedly Blanch Fleur can't be far.

46:10.898 --> 46:12.117
Bertie, come with me.

46:12.150 --> 46:14.131
Ginger, you and Alex
 drop back and covers.

46:15.756 --> 46:18.713
You and me... Nurse,
wait here.

47:12.989 --> 47:13.998
Get down!

47:39.206 --> 47:40.251
Hold chaps!

47:57.460 --> 47:59.781
This is it!
We are in Blanch Fleur.

48:47.999 --> 48:49.460
Algy, Ginger, covering back.

49:00.864 --> 49:04.601
- It's like this town was nucked.
- Nucked? what is that?

49:05.064 --> 49:08.857
Is an American slang that
means too over react.

49:12.073 --> 49:12.664
Come on...

49:43.878 --> 49:44.966
What is that thing?

49:45.489 --> 49:47.727
You shouldn't be surprised
if see some Eskimos!

49:50.719 --> 49:51.902
Let's take a look.

49:57.583 --> 49:58.453
Sir...

50:21.285 --> 50:23.055
Ceramic tile...

50:23.761 --> 50:25.378
like on the space shuttle.

50:25.808 --> 50:27.199
What are you talking about?

50:27.616 --> 50:31.561
What I am saying is these tiles
are made to withstand a lot of heat.

51:26.901 --> 51:28.939
They are using the
dummies as targets.

51:31.201 --> 51:32.557
They must be there to test the weapon.

51:45.007 --> 51:46.334
What's that horn mean?

51:47.002 --> 51:48.906
That we shouldn't be here!

51:53.158 --> 51:54.376
Inside the igloo, quickly!

52:11.932 --> 52:13.914
Listen, she could get hurt.

52:54.325 --> 52:55.848
Captain Von Stalhein.

53:29.113 --> 53:31.131
Well, looks like we'll be
the dummies.

53:45.844 --> 53:49.269
I am an American citizen.
You have no right to treat me this way.

53:49.915 --> 53:51.634
Doesn't anybody speaks English?

53:52.269 --> 53:55.018
Please somebody call the
American Embassy.

53:55.135 --> 53:57.661
Two of us here are
from the United States...

53:58.146 --> 53:59.884
I can prove, I have my passport.

54:00.301 --> 54:01.130
Somewhere in here.

54:01.770 --> 54:04.646
Look, look! My
passport, driver's license, my...

54:05.261 --> 54:06.444
Credit card...

54:07.850 --> 54:10.675
In that case...
I also have my pepper spray.

56:15.828 --> 56:17.390
Watch out for the "Hans" chaps.

58:35.410 --> 58:38.714
They perfected a bloody sound weapon!

58:41.862 --> 58:43.115
We've seen enough.

58:44.564 --> 58:45.433
Let's go!

59:17.910 --> 59:20.832
You two! Stay here.
Until we get it cleaned out.

59:40.135 --> 59:40.901
Ginger!

01:00:18.622 --> 01:00:19.213
Come on!

01:00:23.008 --> 01:00:25.757
Secure it.
Call reinforcements by the way!

01:00:26.163 --> 01:00:28.465
You don't understand?
I got to see Raymond!

01:00:28.466 --> 01:00:28.910
Yes!

01:00:28.911 --> 01:00:30.946
I do not care how you
will, but do not you come with me!

01:00:51.391 --> 01:00:53.417
Hold on. Or I'll shoot!

01:00:58.573 --> 01:01:00.418
Stand still or I will shoot!

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:08.669
Don't move!

01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:18.118
- Stay here!
- Where do you come from?

01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:21.388
- I have no idea!
- Is the hole in time. It keep happening to me.

01:01:21.743 --> 01:01:24.358
- What do you call that?
- Is that a helicopter.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.169
- Where do you get in?
- Tower Bridge.

01:02:07.998 --> 01:02:09.448
Mind if I go to you ladder?

01:02:09.568 --> 01:02:10.369
I do not care.

01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:52.258
Christ, that is beyond comprehension!

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:54.993
And what happened to you?

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.811
I was on my plane...

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.278
The Hans were in our trenches.

01:03:02.639 --> 01:03:04.502
I went up to try
to locate the weapon.

01:03:05.008 --> 01:03:07.896
On Tower Bridge is a man who
got your aerial photography.

01:04:06.616 --> 01:04:07.449
Hey, buddy...

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:11.553
- All right, I take it from here.
- Thank you've been greatful.

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:36.220
Biggles!

01:04:38.758 --> 01:04:40.045
Have I met, sir?

01:04:42.217 --> 01:04:44.651
I am... William Raymond.

01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:48.690
Captain Raymond?

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:51.569
Good God!

01:04:53.704 --> 01:04:55.443
How I missed you old friend!

01:05:00.015 --> 01:05:03.639
I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

01:05:03.924 --> 01:05:06.105
The years led take the tone.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.366
Is the four of us!

01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:19.367
Bertie, Algy, Ginger and me!

01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:20.661
Exactly...

01:05:21.356 --> 01:05:24.278
It was taken when our unit
received his first commendation.

01:05:24.848 --> 01:05:26.936
And I was very proud of all of you.

01:05:31.157 --> 01:05:34.671
That was very last month.
Extraordinary!

01:05:35.177 --> 01:05:36.607
But how did you get here?

01:05:37.152 --> 01:05:39.107
He materialized and
saved my life.

01:05:39.942 --> 01:05:41.960
I would never believe that
I had an experience that.

01:05:42.914 --> 01:05:47.600
So... apparently the hole in
time goes both ways.

01:05:48.396 --> 01:05:51.145
It opens when one of the outs
is in mortal danger.

01:05:52.832 --> 01:05:54.739
Here is the photography you took.

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:58.478
I developed the photographic plate
Ferguson left with me.

01:05:59.207 --> 01:06:01.364
The weapon is very well camouflaged!

01:06:01.799 --> 01:06:04.582
But I used computer enhancement
to show to you more details.

01:06:05.522 --> 01:06:07.454
Computer enhancement...?

01:06:07.793 --> 01:06:11.259
Never mind old friend. I marked
the position of shelter for you.

01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:12.311
Right!

01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:14.981
- It's time!
- The cops are everywhere.

01:06:15.112 --> 01:06:17.061
Anybody got an idea of how
we can get out of here?

01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:31.142
How will you get back?

01:06:32.076 --> 01:06:33.363
To the past !?

01:06:34.413 --> 01:06:35.630
I'll find a way!

01:06:37.864 --> 01:06:40.281
God protect both of you!

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:05.293
Do as I do!

01:07:07.645 --> 01:07:08.619
What you gonna do?

01:07:33.957 --> 01:07:36.879
Pinch me.
What ingenious construction.

01:07:39.683 --> 01:07:42.415
What are you doing?
What do you think you are doing?

01:07:42.416 --> 01:07:43.947
We better to get out of here
before they sees us!

01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:49.032
Wait a minute. You not serious you gonna
try to fly this thing. Are you?

01:07:49.101 --> 01:07:50.626
You don't know how!

01:07:51.945 --> 01:07:55.218
If you can fly one biplane,
you can fly on anything!

01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:56.172
Stay where you are!

01:08:05.684 --> 01:08:06.519
Clever...

01:08:07.476 --> 01:08:10.781
The plane can be tilt to fix this effect...

01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:17.411
Hey, Biggles!

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:19.515
Damn it!

01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:23.122
How do you prepare
the back helm to compensate?

01:08:34.127 --> 01:08:35.520
Why don't you get in!?

01:08:51.158 --> 01:08:52.202
Biggles!

01:09:10.193 --> 01:09:11.549
Welcome aboard!

01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:18.645
Won't take me long before
I learn to control!

01:09:19.533 --> 01:09:21.899
This is good!
We don't have long!

01:09:22.469 --> 01:09:23.890
Try the autopilot!

01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:25.457
Ultrapilot !?

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:26.975
What is that?

01:09:26.975 --> 01:09:27.845
This is this one...

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.475
All right, don't try the autopilot!

01:09:45.497 --> 01:09:46.576
Do not worry old chap!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.470
Think it will work!.

01:09:49.033 --> 01:09:50.843
I think this might work.

01:09:50.844 --> 01:09:51.714
Hang on!

01:09:58.195 --> 01:10:01.309
Biggles, the hole in time!
We just went thought it!

01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:03.308
That's a relief, Ferguson!

01:10:52.141 --> 01:10:55.375
Let's show this
sausage eater what this thing can do!

01:10:56.321 --> 01:10:57.191
Oh, boy!

01:12:25.496 --> 01:12:28.297
Bertie, Algy, Ginger, on your feet!

01:13:05.121 --> 01:13:05.573
Good morning!

01:13:05.747 --> 01:13:06.918
Where have you been !?

01:13:07.498 --> 01:13:09.701
I'm not believing
in my eyes!

01:13:10.544 --> 01:13:12.249
We were worried when
your plane crashed...

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:14.724
What in the hell
 is that thing?

01:13:15.297 --> 01:13:16.565
A flying wind mill !?

01:13:16.979 --> 01:13:17.907
I'll explain later.

01:13:18.711 --> 01:13:21.774
Right now I need a dozen
bombs, a Lois Gun...

01:13:21.775 --> 01:13:24.419
plenty of ammunition... and a bit of luck!

01:13:25.164 --> 01:13:27.426
Well... we can guarantee
bombs and the gun.

01:13:28.657 --> 01:13:31.025
Ginger, get full
battle kits for you all.

01:13:31.113 --> 01:13:32.331
Machine guns and grenades.

01:13:32.804 --> 01:13:33.918
We will get off
on your wind mill?

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:34.899
I'm afraid not.

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:37.337
I'm gonna use it to attack
sound gun!

01:13:37.699 --> 01:13:39.331
I want the three of you
to go to the convent.

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:40.445
... protect civilians.

01:13:41.056 --> 01:13:42.274
The Han may want to take
them as guinea pigs!

01:13:43.093 --> 01:13:44.520
We will change their minds!

01:13:45.273 --> 01:13:46.143
Let's go...

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:47.180
and...

01:13:48.635 --> 01:13:50.034
Look after Mary for me.

01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:57.413
Stand! We will work, hurry!

01:13:59.953 --> 01:14:02.658
Are you still with me, Ferguson?
What you say?

01:14:03.812 --> 01:14:05.516
I say... let's kick some ass...

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:07.269
Old boy!

01:15:16.507 --> 01:15:19.253
Ferguson! Look at the picture
that Raymond gave us...

01:15:19.919 --> 01:15:21.555
The weapon means to be
straight ahead.

01:15:37.524 --> 01:15:39.577
I'll fly straight to
sound weapon!

01:15:40.174 --> 01:15:42.319
turn on that voice box
to the full power!

01:15:43.981 --> 01:15:44.851
Hold on!

01:15:45.605 --> 01:15:46.858
Try out.
- What !?

01:15:47.227 --> 01:15:50.197
The microphone! Throw out
toward the speaker!

01:15:51.569 --> 01:15:53.448
I gonna fight sound with sound!

01:15:54.432 --> 01:15:55.482
Sounds crazy!

01:15:56.207 --> 01:15:57.332
And it's not?

01:15:58.404 --> 01:15:59.274
Make it happen.

01:18:48.755 --> 01:18:50.274
There goes the power base...

01:18:52.858 --> 01:18:54.354
There goes the secret weapon.

01:18:56.764 --> 01:18:59.962
Might say we...
met today.

01:19:01.234 --> 01:19:02.103
Hold tight!

01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:03.974
I have a promise to keep.

01:20:00.312 --> 01:20:01.320
Granada !?

01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:03.954
Too close the civilians!

01:20:05.595 --> 01:20:07.191
Maybe they will listen to reason!

01:20:32.139 --> 01:20:33.153
I say...!

01:20:36.328 --> 01:20:38.311
Would you chaps,
consider surrendering?

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.869
Stay down Sisters.
We not finished yet.

01:22:17.522 --> 01:22:18.418
Marie!

01:22:25.415 --> 01:22:26.354
Get down!

01:22:38.679 --> 01:22:39.410
Let's go!

01:23:47.578 --> 01:23:48.552
Give me the gun!

01:26:05.917 --> 01:26:07.205
Thank you for your help Ferguson.

01:26:35.296 --> 01:26:36.154
Let's go...

01:26:50.734 --> 01:26:52.175
I'll take charges of this man.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.169
Special Air intelligence business...

01:26:56.299 --> 01:26:57.168
Come with me.

01:27:00.753 --> 01:27:01.205
Well...

01:27:01.694 --> 01:27:02.912
Did you finish the job?

01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:04.454
Yes, we finished!

01:27:04.914 --> 01:27:05.783
Good show!

01:27:07.045 --> 01:27:07.699
Raymond,

01:27:09.344 --> 01:27:10.712
Did Biggles make thought the war?

01:27:10.866 --> 01:27:11.572
Oh yes,

01:27:12.139 --> 01:27:16.024
Biggles and his team continued to serve
their country for many years after that.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:18.399
Is he still alive?

01:27:18.923 --> 01:27:20.153
Certainly, I do not know.

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:23.641
The last mission was
the High plateau, New Guinea.

01:27:24.386 --> 01:27:26.530
So far no word has
been received from.

01:27:26.917 --> 01:27:28.956
I just would like to know
if he liked too.

01:27:29.625 --> 01:27:31.470
Well, you have some consolation...

01:27:33.534 --> 01:27:34.579
Look!

01:27:48.395 --> 01:27:55.251
Will you, Deborah Stephens,
have this man, James Ferguson
to be your husband...

01:27:55.253 --> 01:28:00.572
to live together according to God's Law in the Holy
Statute of matrimony...

01:28:01.415 --> 01:28:07.180
Would you love him, comfort him, honor
and keep him in sickness and in health...

01:28:07.397 --> 01:28:11.641
for sake of all others,
keeping the honor to him,

01:28:12.139 --> 01:28:13.704
as you both shall live?

01:28:14.784 --> 01:28:15.689
I will.

01:28:18.832 --> 01:28:19.772
The ring please!

01:29:10.213 --> 01:29:11.152
Quick! Untie,

01:29:11.561 --> 01:29:13.774
get us out of here before they realise
you are not a God.

01:29:13.775 --> 01:29:15.162
You are just an American!

01:29:32.941 --> 01:29:35.368
You know you guys don't taste to bad!

01:29:40.538 --> 01:29:41.686
Come on, let's go!

01:29:56.423 --> 01:29:58.928
You think you guys are in hot water?
I was just getting married!

01:29:59.113 --> 01:30:00.682
This is a hell of way
to start a honeymoon.

01:30:01.477 --> 01:30:04.191
- Hey Biggles, where are we going?
- Come on, Ferguson!

01:30:05.305 --> 01:30:11.208
