00:40.343 --> 00:43.429
Flowers are for funerals.

00:50.936 --> 00:54.314
From your friend.

00:54.316 --> 00:57.109
I have little use for their kind in years.

00:59.445 --> 01:01.112
In face of difficulty,

01:01.113 --> 01:05.114
large grievances become...

01:05.117 --> 01:07.701
so minor.

02:19.108 --> 02:21.067
Oh, wait!

02:21.067 --> 02:23.194
I wanna try something.

02:35.581 --> 02:38.543
Doctors say the longer

02:38.585 --> 02:42.381
you stay in a coma, the less
likely you are to wake up.

02:42.382 --> 02:46.466
Pfff! Doctors.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.721
You really have a way with words.

02:55.144 --> 02:58.811
Can you tell me a story
about being a gypsy?

02:58.812 --> 03:01.733
You guys realize I'm half Italian, right?

03:01.733 --> 03:04.902
We do. It's just no one cares.

03:07.656 --> 03:09.907
All right.

03:12.036 --> 03:13.995
One time Nicolai caught a fairy.

03:14.037 --> 03:16.662
What do you mean a fairy?

03:16.663 --> 03:18.831
I mean a fairy. What am I supposed to mean?

03:18.834 --> 03:22.420
OK, go on.

03:22.462 --> 03:25.466
I was at his house one night.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.466
It was the summer,

03:27.467 --> 03:30.596
so it was just scorching hot.

03:30.597 --> 03:33.847
Must have been eight or nine.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.848
And he says, "You wanna see something?"

03:35.849 --> 03:38.477
So he turns off all the lights,

03:38.478 --> 03:40.438
and he gave me this jar

03:40.480 --> 03:42.483
with a little light inside,

03:44.484 --> 03:46.901
And I go, "Nic, that's just...

03:46.902 --> 03:49.197
that's a lightning bug", and he goes,

03:49.198 --> 03:51.948
"No, Peter...

03:51.949 --> 03:54.075
look closer".

03:54.078 --> 03:56.829
Yeah?

03:56.829 --> 03:59.789
And I held it up...

03:59.792 --> 04:01.751
and I shit you not,

04:01.751 --> 04:05.337
there's this little person inside the jar,

04:05.340 --> 04:07.799
a little girl,

04:07.799 --> 04:10.216
no bigger than a thumbnail.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.218
And her wings are so beautiful

04:12.221 --> 04:14.222
like a dragonfly.

04:16.309 --> 04:19.976
And this little light...

04:19.978 --> 04:23.357
What was she wearing?

04:23.357 --> 04:25.690
- What?
- So I go to Nic like,

04:25.692 --> 04:28.612
"Holy! Where did you find her?"

04:28.612 --> 04:30.821
And all he says is,

04:30.822 --> 04:32.990
"She was just...

04:32.990 --> 04:37.452
flying around the
porch light with the moths".

04:37.454 --> 04:39.999
She must have gotten lost.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.333
Yeah. You know, at first he tried

04:42.334 --> 04:45.252
to catch 'em with his hands,
but I guess she stung him.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.505
- Fairies sting?
- Oh! You have no idea.

04:47.505 --> 04:49.714
Fairies are meaner than fucking hornets!

04:49.716 --> 04:50.757
- Who knew?
- Yeah.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.802
So what did you do with her?

04:53.803 --> 04:56.430
We just kept her for a while.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.684
What did she eat?

04:59.685 --> 05:01.644
- Flies.
- Ugh!

05:01.644 --> 05:04.398
Ha! Ha! Ha! Gross!

05:04.398 --> 05:06.483
Pretty fairies do not eat flies.

05:06.524 --> 05:09.526
Just grabbed them out of the air

05:09.528 --> 05:11.529
and tore 'em apart.

05:11.529 --> 05:13.531
Mm! Stop it.

05:13.531 --> 05:15.783
Better than watching
tarantulas go after crickets.

05:26.211 --> 05:28.172
So what happened to her?

05:30.882 --> 05:33.384
She died.

05:33.386 --> 05:36.346
One day it was just a tiny old
lady in the bottom of the jar.

05:39.434 --> 05:43.269
At first, I thought she
was just napping so I shook it.

05:45.398 --> 05:48.149
Definitely dead.

05:51.446 --> 05:55.156
No one can fucking live like that.

07:53.274 --> 07:55.694
Clear your head.

07:58.238 --> 08:00.238
Must do what he said.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.744
Clear your head. Clear
your head. Clear your head.

08:12.252 --> 08:15.504
Fucking psychic spooky weird twin shit!

08:15.505 --> 08:17.507
Fuck!

08:19.843 --> 08:21.887
...damn hands up, bitch!

08:24.430 --> 08:27.267
I can't have my baby here.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.479
We always have had time for each other.

08:32.480 --> 08:36.568
God does not want us to be
happy. He wants us to be strong.

08:44.283 --> 08:47.328
Welcome to the Order of
the Dragon, Dr. Chasseur.

09:11.479 --> 09:15.730
...Quam Misericors est Deus,

09:15.732 --> 09:19.068
Pius et Justus.

09:19.110 --> 09:20.738
O...

09:22.739 --> 09:24.950
Your hands.

09:31.791 --> 09:35.125
O Quam Misericors est Deus,

09:35.126 --> 09:38.879
Pius et Justus.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.264
When the moon is full, do
you walk in the skin of a wolf?

09:48.306 --> 09:52.936
We and the barons and
magnates of our kingdom

09:52.979 --> 09:55.772
shall bear and have...

09:55.773 --> 09:57.816
and do choose and agree

09:57.859 --> 10:00.359
to bear and wear the sign

10:00.360 --> 10:02.613
or effigy of the dragon

10:02.653 --> 10:05.614
incurved into this form of a circle...

10:05.615 --> 10:09.158
its tail winding around its neck...

10:09.160 --> 10:12.496
divided through the middle of its back

10:12.498 --> 10:16.249
with blood forming a red cross.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.879
But it remains untouched by that blood,

10:19.879 --> 10:21.965
just as all of those

10:22.008 --> 10:25.258
who fight under the banner of
the glorious martyr St. George

10:25.259 --> 10:27.345
remain untouched by the beast.

10:27.345 --> 10:30.765
The beast is the devil

10:30.807 --> 10:34.225
appearing on Earth as
a radiant heavenly being,

10:34.227 --> 10:36.938
claiming to be God.

10:38.941 --> 10:42.485
But you shall root him out.

10:46.032 --> 10:48.282
Let Him serve as your guide

10:48.325 --> 10:50.785
and from this day forward...

10:52.830 --> 10:55.455
...let it be

10:55.456 --> 10:57.835
the only one you bear.

11:01.212 --> 11:03.172
May you strike down

11:03.215 --> 11:06.509
God's enemies and smite them

11:06.551 --> 11:09.804
from the Earth in his name.

11:16.979 --> 11:20.648
It's gotta be him.

11:20.648 --> 11:22.734
So why don't I believe it?

11:29.575 --> 11:31.157
Who are you?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.994
What are you?

11:50.052 --> 11:53.347
You're going to lose your soul.

11:53.389 --> 11:55.850
Ahhh!

12:02.355 --> 12:04.357
Cool view!

12:04.359 --> 12:08.278
OK, who did you blow to get this room?

12:08.278 --> 12:11.282
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

12:11.282 --> 12:13.243
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:13.283 --> 12:15.244
I just woke up.

12:15.244 --> 12:18.039
OK, um, we brought
some DVDs for you to watch.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.628
Or we could do whatever you want.

12:23.671 --> 12:25.672
Yeah.

12:25.672 --> 12:28.423
Don't you like Scrabble
or something? I mean,

12:28.424 --> 12:31.595
I can download the app
on my phone if you want.

12:38.350 --> 12:40.311
Do, do you see something?

12:40.354 --> 12:42.815
No, I don't see anything.

12:44.816 --> 12:47.777
Um... whatever you guys
want to do, I'll do.

12:51.196 --> 12:53.868
Lys.

12:56.703 --> 13:00.330
I'm sorry.

13:00.331 --> 13:02.375
I'm sorry.

13:04.794 --> 13:06.797
You're my best friend.

13:08.798 --> 13:11.801
I'll be OK.

13:11.844 --> 13:14.345
I'll be OK.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.272
Jesus.

13:28.902 --> 13:32.321
Hey. How's she doing?

13:32.321 --> 13:35.658
I hate it here, Dad.
Chrissy hates it here too.

13:37.660 --> 13:39.870
She said she was feeling better and...

13:39.871 --> 13:42.248
really, really wants to stay with us.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.542
Did she actually say that?

13:44.585 --> 13:48.294
Uh... she, she didn't have to.

13:48.296 --> 13:50.547
Yeah, friends always know
what other friends are thinking.

13:50.548 --> 13:53.094
- Always.
- Yeah.

13:57.597 --> 14:00.725
Our girl's been through
a lot lately, and I know

14:00.768 --> 14:03.436
that hospitals are no fun,
but Dr. Godfrey thinks she needs

14:03.477 --> 14:06.648
to stay here a little bit longer, and
I need to trust his judgment on this.

14:06.690 --> 14:08.609
- Dad...
- Hey.

14:10.443 --> 14:13.947
She knows that you two
love her so very much,

14:13.989 --> 14:16.825
like a sister,

14:16.866 --> 14:19.994
and that's what she needs right now.

14:19.994 --> 14:21.455
OK?

14:21.495 --> 14:23.289
Yeah.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.167
OK. Come on.

14:52.777 --> 14:54.571
Ahh...

14:56.907 --> 14:58.908
You're still so beautiful...

15:00.910 --> 15:03.496
...as beautiful as the day I first saw you.

15:10.296 --> 15:14.381
You, uh, probably have to get home.

15:16.509 --> 15:18.470
OK.

15:20.471 --> 15:23.431
You don't?

15:23.432 --> 15:25.643
What?

15:25.643 --> 15:27.604
Have to go home?

15:30.273 --> 15:32.275
Of course I do.

15:48.499 --> 15:50.793
Let me help you, darling.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.703
There.

16:25.745 --> 16:29.374
Better.

17:01.197 --> 17:03.200
I think you got it.

17:05.201 --> 17:08.742
Letha is fucking Peter Rumancek.

17:08.743 --> 17:10.746
What?!

17:10.747 --> 17:12.750
She told you this?

17:12.750 --> 17:15.336
Of course not. She doesn't
tell me anything.

17:15.376 --> 17:17.461
Well, then how do you know?

17:17.462 --> 17:20.256
Her phone, text messages.

17:20.259 --> 17:22.759
Marie, you had no right.

17:22.759 --> 17:25.428
I mean, that's an invasion of her privacy.

17:25.429 --> 17:28.098
Our daughter claims she has

17:28.140 --> 17:30.848
been impregnated by an angel.

17:30.849 --> 17:34.060
An angel, Norman! Now, she's sleeping

17:34.061 --> 17:36.064
with a boy that half
the people in Hemlock Grove

17:36.106 --> 17:39.023
- think is a serial killer.
- Uh, well they don't just think

17:39.025 --> 17:41.444
he's a serial killer, Marie,
they think he's a werewolf,

17:41.486 --> 17:43.487
and that is insane.

17:43.490 --> 17:46.451
Do you know that one of my
patients originated that rumor?

17:46.491 --> 17:48.492
It's character assassination

17:48.492 --> 17:51.538
by a traumatized 14-year-old girl.

17:51.578 --> 17:54.000
I need you to be her father,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
not her friend.

17:59.798 --> 18:01.381
OK.

18:01.423 --> 18:04.049
I'll talk to her.

18:04.092 --> 18:06.801
Hey, guys, I'm home.

18:32.453 --> 18:34.539
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:37.836 --> 18:40.211
Um...

18:40.212 --> 18:43.884
your mom... your mom
got ahold of your cell phone.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.135
We know about Peter.

18:50.137 --> 18:54.808
- Dad...
- She had no right.

18:54.809 --> 18:56.894
Was it, um...

18:56.895 --> 18:58.855
was it your first time...

18:58.896 --> 19:01.567
in a manner of speaking?

19:01.567 --> 19:04.986
- Yeah.
- It's not a bad thing.

19:05.028 --> 19:07.240
I mean, don't ever let anyone

19:07.240 --> 19:09.201
put in your head that sex is,

19:09.241 --> 19:11.284
is a bad thing.

19:11.326 --> 19:13.494
Is this as awkward for you as it is for me?

19:13.538 --> 19:15.539
- Yeah!
- Ha!

19:17.540 --> 19:20.376
Sit.

19:24.506 --> 19:28.217
But lying, lying to me, to us,

19:28.218 --> 19:30.221
hiding things,

19:30.261 --> 19:33.057
that's a problem.

19:33.057 --> 19:36.434
We're a family. We don't keep secrets

19:36.476 --> 19:39.396
- from each other.
- I'm in love with him.

19:43.482 --> 19:46.734
People see someone like Peter
as a blank piece of paper

19:46.736 --> 19:49.280
they can just put everything
they're afraid of on.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.867
You know how people are.

19:53.867 --> 19:56.119
I mean...

19:56.121 --> 19:58.705
what do you think people say about Shelley?

20:03.044 --> 20:05.048
Do you trust me?

20:09.925 --> 20:11.928
Hi.

20:20.936 --> 20:23.731
I hope this isn't a bad time.

20:27.028 --> 20:28.944
He's upstairs.

20:28.987 --> 20:32.656
Oh. Uh... No, I'm not here to see him.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.326
I mean, I pray for him,

20:35.327 --> 20:37.288
but... I came here

20:37.328 --> 20:39.330
because I thought
maybe you needed a friend.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.376
I figured this hasn't been easy on you.

20:44.419 --> 20:47.128
Wow! That sounds so stupid.

20:47.130 --> 20:50.174
Of course this hasn't been
easy on you. Uh... what I mean

20:50.215 --> 20:53.386
- is that...
- It's not stupid.

20:55.972 --> 20:58.016
Can I give you a hug?

21:04.689 --> 21:07.898
- Hey!
- Hey.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.987
Uh, I just wanted you
to know how sorry I am.

21:11.990 --> 21:14.071
I'm kind of sick about the whole thing.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.741
I was trying to think of
the last time I talked to Roman

21:16.742 --> 21:18.742
before this and...

21:18.743 --> 21:20.744
I think I was a bitch to him.

21:20.746 --> 21:23.375
I'm sure that's not true.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.794
Uh, anyway I made him this.

21:26.836 --> 21:29.423
If you wouldn't mind bringing it to him...

21:29.423 --> 21:31.259
Yeah, of course.

21:31.299 --> 21:34.718
Thanks. I really...

21:34.721 --> 21:37.057
I hope he's OK.

21:43.605 --> 21:46.439
What was that about?

21:46.481 --> 21:49.568
Evidently, Ashley Valentine
does have a soul.

21:52.529 --> 21:54.530
So, I wanted to ask you something.

21:54.573 --> 21:57.659
I want you to come to dinner at my house.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.540
So, you said you
found me through my website?

22:04.583 --> 22:07.000
Yes. Not many people who do...

22:07.001 --> 22:09.126
what you do in the tri-state area.

22:09.127 --> 22:11.798
Fair enough.

22:11.798 --> 22:14.384
No offense, but you don't really
seem like the type to come

22:14.425 --> 22:17.803
- to a person like me.
- Excuse me?

22:17.846 --> 22:20.182
Well, there...

22:20.182 --> 22:22.769
tend to be certain life
events that bring clients

22:22.808 --> 22:24.934
to my doorstep...

22:24.935 --> 22:28.106
a death in the family, mother, father,

22:28.146 --> 22:30.732
sometimes a favorite uncle.

22:30.733 --> 22:34.153
Infidelity is another big one
too, clichÃ© as that may be.

22:34.194 --> 22:37.365
And then there are those tragic
folk who wake up one morning

22:37.406 --> 22:40.367
and remember they've been molested...

22:40.367 --> 22:42.369
sometimes by their favorite uncle.

22:45.205 --> 22:47.208
But you...

22:47.250 --> 22:50.127
your problem doesn't fall into
any of those categories, do you?

22:52.631 --> 22:56.259
Your problem seems to me to be much more...

22:56.259 --> 22:57.926
internal.

22:57.971 --> 23:00.178
How do you figure?

23:00.179 --> 23:03.599
Well, for one, I could smell it on your
breath the second you walked in the door.

23:03.644 --> 23:06.435
Don't worry. There's no judgments here.

23:08.355 --> 23:10.355
You can talk to me...

23:10.356 --> 23:12.317
about anything.

23:12.357 --> 23:15.403
I want to talk to you about family.

23:15.444 --> 23:17.529
I sense you don't have much of one.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.784
Your family, actually. A cousin,

23:20.826 --> 23:23.910
if I'm not mistaken.

23:23.913 --> 23:27.125
I know what you think you're
looking for, but you'd be wrong.

23:27.165 --> 23:29.208
Then why am I here?

23:29.250 --> 23:32.002
To find what you've been looking for.

23:32.044 --> 23:35.464
Like I said, there are no judgments here.

23:35.509 --> 23:37.924
You can talk to me

23:37.924 --> 23:39.926
about anything.

23:44.890 --> 23:47.309
I'm not sure I can trust myself anymore.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.357
I'm afraid I've lost my path to God.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.942
- When you say God, you mean...
- I mean God.

23:55.943 --> 23:59.154
Right. I'm sorry.

23:59.155 --> 24:01.865
I don't get many big Gs in here.

24:01.865 --> 24:04.410
And the ones I do are usually
enjoying my other services.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.086
Interesting, though...

24:15.505 --> 24:17.423
...that as a woman of faith
you have such a problem

24:17.464 --> 24:19.800
with control.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.183
Let me see your hands.

24:28.184 --> 24:30.227
Why?

24:30.230 --> 24:32.646
Because it's important that I see.

24:42.155 --> 24:45.951
Look, you came here for a reason
and I let you in for a reason,

24:45.992 --> 24:48.078
so let's just put all our shit
aside and trust each other

24:48.078 --> 24:49.997
for two seconds.

25:06.598 --> 25:09.726
It's in every part of you.

25:14.021 --> 25:16.692
You're not lying.

25:16.692 --> 25:19.528
You have been searching.

25:19.528 --> 25:21.819
Uh...

25:21.820 --> 25:23.906
Mmm...

25:30.747 --> 25:34.290
Will you tell me what you saw?

25:34.291 --> 25:36.515
What you felt?

25:38.423 --> 25:40.423
Please.

25:40.423 --> 25:42.467
Please, I need to know.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.659
Let me restore you.

26:24.675 --> 26:28.761
Would you like to hear God's voice again?

26:28.762 --> 26:30.763
Yes.

26:30.765 --> 26:32.809
Yes...

26:59.336 --> 27:02.838
Ah, Mrs. Godfrey.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.799
Sorry. Did we, uh, call you?

27:04.840 --> 27:07.384
No. As a matter of fact, you did not,

27:07.385 --> 27:09.386
and you should have by now.

27:09.386 --> 27:11.432
Why isn't my son's car ready yet?

27:11.472 --> 27:14.644
Uh, we had to change the starter

27:14.684 --> 27:16.769
and some electrical...

27:16.810 --> 27:18.896
Parts for a car this old aren't...

27:18.896 --> 27:20.857
easy to find.

27:20.898 --> 27:24.484
I want it in driving
condition, and I want it now.

27:30.826 --> 27:33.285
Marie.

27:33.327 --> 27:35.453
Olivia.

27:37.455 --> 27:40.541
- Car trouble?
- Well, you know, he thinks it's nothing,

27:40.542 --> 27:42.923
but every time I drive it,
I hear this rattling.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.714
Prevention is the best cure.

27:45.759 --> 27:47.925
How is Roman?

27:47.967 --> 27:50.801
No...

27:50.803 --> 27:52.804
change yet.

27:52.807 --> 27:55.223
Letha's been stopping by
quite a bit to see him.

27:55.223 --> 27:58.144
Truly lovely girl.

27:58.184 --> 28:01.564
Thank you. Norman also?

28:01.606 --> 28:03.732
Yes, a...

28:03.732 --> 28:05.984
a great support as always.

28:06.028 --> 28:08.070
Yes, he is.

28:08.111 --> 28:12.032
It's a pleasure running
into you. It's been so long.

28:12.076 --> 28:13.576
It has.

28:16.954 --> 28:18.915
Olivia.

28:18.957 --> 28:22.250
He's in our thoughts.

28:22.251 --> 28:24.963
Good luck with the rattle.

28:45.817 --> 28:48.611
Thanks, Nic.

28:48.653 --> 28:50.865
What's that?

28:58.871 --> 29:02.083
We were worried you might be a vegetarian.

29:02.125 --> 29:05.376
No. The steak's good.

29:05.419 --> 29:07.298
It's great, Mom. Thanks.

29:07.338 --> 29:10.674
She uses a special marinade.

29:10.674 --> 29:12.635
What's in it again?

29:12.676 --> 29:14.971
Just a little bit of love.

29:22.227 --> 29:25.313
Did you guys see that picture
in the paper of the guy

29:25.314 --> 29:28.525
walking down Liberty Avenue
with a leopard on his back?

29:28.528 --> 29:30.319
No.

29:30.361 --> 29:32.696
No.

29:32.740 --> 29:34.740
Sorry.

29:34.781 --> 29:36.992
Oh! Well, there was this guy

29:36.992 --> 29:39.118
walking naked down Liberty Avenue

29:39.119 --> 29:42.375
with a leopard on his back.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.415
Was the leopard alive?

29:44.415 --> 29:47.002
- I'm not sure.
- Hmm!

29:49.963 --> 29:53.299
So, Peter...

29:53.342 --> 29:56.011
senior year. Pretty stressful time, right?

29:56.054 --> 29:58.432
Not really.

30:00.348 --> 30:04.310
Well, I assume you're thinking
about colleges.

30:06.771 --> 30:09.733
Thinking about it, sure.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.734
Hmm...

30:11.736 --> 30:13.779
Letha's already written her personal essay.

30:13.820 --> 30:17.532
I think I might have to defer
that for a year though.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.292
So, uh, Mrs. Godfrey,
how did you meet Mr. Godfrey?

30:30.880 --> 30:32.923
Uh, we met at the mill.

30:32.924 --> 30:35.842
- My father...
- Her father was a steel worker.

30:35.843 --> 30:38.932
- Worked for my family.
- Really?

30:38.971 --> 30:41.557
He was a good man. Always made me call him

30:41.598 --> 30:44.434
Mr. Newport. Very prideful.

30:46.561 --> 30:49.646
- He was a hard worker.
- And Mr. Newport

30:49.647 --> 30:52.818
did not want me anywhere
near his daughter. Ha! Ha! Ha!

30:52.859 --> 30:55.195
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

30:55.240 --> 30:57.240
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.366
Mom, you never told me that.

30:59.407 --> 31:01.367
How did he win you over?

31:01.367 --> 31:03.328
Godfreys, uh, get what they want.

31:03.369 --> 31:05.205
What's that, honey?

31:07.500 --> 31:09.667
Godfreys get what they want.

31:09.711 --> 31:11.923
Stop.

31:14.298 --> 31:16.509
Excuse me.

31:16.549 --> 31:20.303
I'm just suddenly feeling
a little bit tired.

31:20.304 --> 31:23.015
Mom.

31:29.021 --> 31:32.817
How about it, partner?

31:32.857 --> 31:35.358
It's not a trick question.

31:35.359 --> 31:37.445
Yeah. Please.

31:42.742 --> 31:46.538
So... what should we drink to?

31:46.579 --> 31:48.375
To Roman.

31:50.876 --> 31:54.298
- To Roman.
- Roman.

32:23.867 --> 32:26.788
He's not who you're looking for, you know?

32:26.788 --> 32:29.747
I don't know that.

32:29.750 --> 32:32.126
Well, then maybe you didn't learn a thing.

32:36.881 --> 32:39.759
How is it so easy for you?

32:43.054 --> 32:45.513
It's not about knowing.

32:47.724 --> 32:50.019
It's all right here.

33:09.372 --> 33:11.332
Yes?

33:11.375 --> 33:13.457
Is the lady of the house at home?

33:13.458 --> 33:15.461
May I say who's calling?

33:15.461 --> 33:18.298
It's OK. I wouldn't want
her killing the messenger.

33:20.549 --> 33:22.549
- How the other half lives.
- I'm sorry,

33:22.550 --> 33:25.553
- I cannot let you in unannounced.
- Is she upstairs?

33:25.554 --> 33:27.848
No, no, please! She'll be very upset!

33:43.655 --> 33:45.701
I'm sorry about your boy.

33:45.741 --> 33:48.826
Thank you. Let me, uh...

33:48.827 --> 33:51.329
No, no. Come on. I know you're good for it.

34:07.721 --> 34:10.891
When Peter was born, his
shoulders were too broad.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.271
He got stuck in the birth
canal, suffocating.

34:19.110 --> 34:22.445
The doctor did everything
he could to get him out

34:22.447 --> 34:25.996
until finally, he just, he had
to reach his hands in and...

34:26.030 --> 34:28.617
snap my baby's collarbone.

34:28.617 --> 34:30.621
I could feel the crack
all the way through my body.

34:34.791 --> 34:37.670
And then there he was blue as the sky.

34:40.130 --> 34:42.507
Doctor said it was up to him.

34:42.507 --> 34:45.802
He was either gonna take a breath or not.

34:45.802 --> 34:49.306
And then he took a breath.

34:49.306 --> 34:53.143
Hmm... and then he took a breath.

34:56.063 --> 34:58.230
It isn't easy raising them on your own,

34:58.231 --> 35:00.192
especially when you didn't have any choice

35:00.233 --> 35:02.902
in the matter.

35:02.902 --> 35:05.280
But then, you know,
you really have to wonder...

35:07.155 --> 35:09.951
I mean, what would a man provide anyway?

35:14.164 --> 35:16.164
Sometimes it's just...

35:16.166 --> 35:18.168
nice having them around.

35:20.170 --> 35:23.005
Nice but...

35:23.007 --> 35:25.007
incredibly... Ha! Ha! Ha!

35:25.009 --> 35:27.219
...stupid.

35:27.260 --> 35:29.846
Ha! Ha! Ha!

35:29.889 --> 35:33.306
Utterly useless! Ha! Ha! Ha!

35:35.853 --> 35:38.855
There's something very different

35:38.855 --> 35:41.400
about having a son.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.068
There's something very
different about raising

35:44.110 --> 35:47.864
a little man. You spend your whole life

35:47.905 --> 35:51.492
thinking you're all they've got
and then one day you realize...

35:51.536 --> 35:55.913
they're all you've got.

35:55.914 --> 35:59.208
And what do you do with that?

36:01.335 --> 36:04.297
It's not up to him.

36:04.338 --> 36:06.047
What was that?

36:06.092 --> 36:09.219
It's not.

36:09.219 --> 36:11.387
It's not up to...

36:11.389 --> 36:15.306
Roman when he dies. It's not...

36:15.306 --> 36:17.184
it's not his decision,

36:17.228 --> 36:19.855
it's mine.

36:19.896 --> 36:21.896
It's too soon.

36:23.900 --> 36:25.902
It's too soon.

36:30.574 --> 36:33.576
Full moon tomorrow.

36:33.577 --> 36:36.496
You got spunk in your ears,
Rumancek? I'm talking to you,

36:36.496 --> 36:38.498
you dirty gypsy piece of shit.

36:38.498 --> 36:41.500
Aw, he's probably just down
'cause his girlfriend's in a coma.

36:41.501 --> 36:43.460
Need to run home and suck
Sleeping Beauty's dick?

36:43.460 --> 36:45.505
- You deaf, faggot?
- So, where's the, uh...

36:45.505 --> 36:47.588
where's the wolf half
come from anyway, right?

36:47.592 --> 36:49.509
Yeah, your mom toss a steak
between her legs and say,

36:49.509 --> 36:51.510
"Come and get it, boys?"

36:51.510 --> 36:53.277
Shee-it.

36:53.306 --> 36:54.681
Ugh!

36:54.722 --> 36:57.601
Oh, my god!

36:57.643 --> 37:00.605
- Holy shit!
- Wait! Let him go!

37:04.106 --> 37:06.860
Hey!

37:06.902 --> 37:09.237
Leave him alone!

37:09.277 --> 37:12.072
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry.

37:12.074 --> 37:14.992
- Ugh...
- Hey...

37:23.626 --> 37:25.335
Ugh...

37:33.135 --> 37:35.139
It's not one of my nice ones.

37:41.768 --> 37:43.813
Darling, I should really take you home.

37:52.572 --> 37:54.489
Well, at least give your mother a call.

37:54.534 --> 37:56.826
She's wound rather

37:56.867 --> 37:58.452
tightly these days.

38:07.380 --> 38:10.130
Ah, come on.

38:10.132 --> 38:13.134
Come on, come on, come on!

38:20.601 --> 38:24.268
Who could do such a thing
to a face so beautiful?

38:24.313 --> 38:27.356
It's fine. It was no one.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.983
Dracu' sa le ia.

38:31.987 --> 38:33.945
Sit, sit.

38:33.947 --> 38:36.489
Come in.

38:38.577 --> 38:42.121
OK.

38:42.121 --> 38:44.541
It's swelling up.

38:47.001 --> 38:49.210
- How much pain are you in?
- It's fine.

38:49.210 --> 38:52.007
Yeah?

38:52.047 --> 38:54.550
- Sorry.
- Ah!

38:54.552 --> 38:57.010
OK...

38:57.010 --> 38:59.764
drink this in one go as fast as you can.

38:59.806 --> 39:02.391
OK?

39:02.393 --> 39:04.396
This is for the swelling.

39:04.434 --> 39:06.978
When it thaws there's more.

39:06.980 --> 39:09.065
OK, sure.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.989
I think you know what to do with this.

39:24.914 --> 39:27.083
You can go. Take care of him in the back.

39:27.125 --> 39:29.210
OK.

39:47.393 --> 39:49.396
Hey.

39:49.396 --> 39:51.400
Sorry.

40:00.701 --> 40:04.077
"Will you tell me a story
about being a gypsy?"

40:04.077 --> 40:06.288
You are such a jerk!

40:06.289 --> 40:08.416
Oh! Hey, I'm sorry.

40:11.001 --> 40:13.001
At least it wasn't stitches.

40:13.005 --> 40:15.172
I hate fucking stitches.

40:17.259 --> 40:19.969
Perhaps, uh...

40:19.969 --> 40:21.971
Peter should stay at our house for a time.

40:24.016 --> 40:27.268
A full moon does bring it out in people.

40:27.268 --> 40:30.146
I don't know. This is his home.

40:33.150 --> 40:36.193
We wouldn't want another broken collarbone.

40:47.581 --> 40:50.414
All right, this one's for Shelley.

40:50.416 --> 40:53.556
"Which book begins, 'Last night I dreamt

40:53.585 --> 40:56.672
I went to Manderley again?'"

40:56.713 --> 40:58.717
- It's not a book.
- Yeah, it is.

40:58.759 --> 41:01.815
- Rebecca.
- How did you know that?

41:01.817 --> 41:03.213
Jesus!

41:04.264 --> 41:06.726
- I read.
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

41:06.766 --> 41:08.643
That's my cousin.

41:08.684 --> 41:12.521
- It hurts?
- It's not so bad.

41:12.521 --> 41:14.817
Really, I'm fine.

41:14.858 --> 41:16.527
Who else is hungry?

41:16.568 --> 41:19.277
Eh?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.699
Hmm, I was thinking something
more microwaveable.

41:24.159 --> 41:26.451
- All right. I'm on it.
- Thank you.

41:26.452 --> 41:28.581
And no cheating. I know a schemer

41:28.621 --> 41:31.666
- when I see one.
- Ha! Ha!

41:57.567 --> 42:00.152
Did you find what you were looking for?

42:02.989 --> 42:06.201
- Not really.
- Try some Vaseline

42:06.242 --> 42:09.202
and cayenne pepper.

42:09.246 --> 42:11.663
Huh?

42:11.664 --> 42:13.958
For your face...

42:13.958 --> 42:16.085
help with the swelling.

42:21.257 --> 42:23.259
Boys...

42:27.012 --> 42:29.806
Can I ask why you'd want to help me?

42:29.849 --> 42:33.393
Roman needs all the friends
he can get right now.

42:35.438 --> 42:38.356
Besides, someone had to step in

42:38.356 --> 42:41.277
before things got too... hairy.

42:45.405 --> 42:47.574
Hmm.

42:47.576 --> 42:49.577
Well, thanks.

43:22.193 --> 43:25.152
When the moon is full, do
you walk in the skin of a wolf?

43:44.884 --> 43:48.427
I'll be careful.

44:04.027 --> 44:06.027
Hey.

44:06.027 --> 44:08.030
What are you doing here?

44:08.072 --> 44:11.492
I need to talk to you.

44:11.534 --> 44:13.952
I spoke to Destiny.

44:43.481 --> 44:46.757
- What happened to your face?
- I lost a beauty pageant.

44:46.777 --> 44:50.655
- I know why you're here.
- Really?

44:52.659 --> 44:54.952
You're here to make sure
that no more girls get killed.

44:58.081 --> 45:00.083
You came all the way down here to share

45:00.083 --> 45:02.043
this epiphany with me? Why?

45:02.043 --> 45:05.126
Because I need your help.

45:07.172 --> 45:10.342
Full moon's tonight.

45:10.342 --> 45:14.096
And I got a bad feeling about it.

45:14.097 --> 45:16.597
That right?

45:16.599 --> 45:19.351
I've had this feeling before.

45:19.351 --> 45:22.105
You want to talk about it?

45:22.105 --> 45:24.106
Not especially.

45:24.106 --> 45:26.567
- So what do you want me to do?
- What you came here for!

45:33.324 --> 45:36.911
There's this, uh...

45:36.911 --> 45:40.163
girl. Her name is Letha Godfrey.

45:42.164 --> 45:44.920
Just, um...

45:44.960 --> 45:47.797
make sure that nothing bad happens to her.

45:49.842 --> 45:52.172
Because I can't.

45:52.175 --> 45:54.096
OK?

45:54.137 --> 45:57.472
Can you do that? Please?

46:10.318 --> 46:13.905
No more girls are gonna die.

46:13.905 --> 46:15.951
I promise.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.543
Oh! Yes.

46:25.543 --> 46:27.501
He, um, he wants you to know

46:27.501 --> 46:30.005
that you two are... "cool".

46:30.007 --> 46:32.132
Ha! Ha!

46:32.134 --> 46:34.677
Tyler, the boy.

46:34.677 --> 46:37.346
I'm rarely in the position
of playing cupid,

46:37.346 --> 46:39.639
but he rather insistently
communicated the message

46:39.641 --> 46:41.643
to my daughter.

46:43.643 --> 46:46.438
He knows you didn't mean it.

46:48.858 --> 46:51.193
It's really pretty here,

46:51.193 --> 46:53.820
for a mental institution.

46:53.822 --> 46:57.659
Not that I'm the expert.

47:00.202 --> 47:03.621
Would you rather go inside?

47:03.623 --> 47:05.583
You know,

47:05.625 --> 47:08.335
when I was a little kid,

47:08.335 --> 47:11.047
I used to hide under the blanket
every time I heard it thunder.

47:13.132 --> 47:15.134
Now, I could just sit
and watch the clouds all day.

47:15.134 --> 47:17.096
Nothing beats

47:17.135 --> 47:19.260
that feeling of being safe and snug

47:19.262 --> 47:21.224
while things just...

47:21.264 --> 47:23.757
fall to pieces outside, you know?

47:23.768 --> 47:26.143
Do you feel safe here?

47:26.188 --> 47:29.021
It feels like nothing can
get its hands on you here.

47:38.784 --> 47:41.576
I knew him, actually.

47:41.577 --> 47:44.371
- Excuse me?
- You were thinking about him,

47:44.371 --> 47:47.750
about that... the bum who died in here.

47:47.750 --> 47:50.545
Sorry. I shouldn't call him a bum.

47:52.547 --> 47:54.547
He was your patient too, wasn't he?

47:57.094 --> 47:59.469
Yes. He, um...

47:59.471 --> 48:03.097
he was.

48:03.099 --> 48:05.268
My grandparents lived by Kilderry Park,

48:05.268 --> 48:07.268
so I used to...

48:07.268 --> 48:09.353
see him around a lot.

48:09.355 --> 48:12.150
I guess I shouldn't really
say that I knew him.

48:12.150 --> 48:14.358
I mean, he had an entire life

48:14.360 --> 48:16.835
with parents and everything,
and I don't really

48:16.862 --> 48:19.572
know anything about it,

48:19.574 --> 48:23.286
except for... the obvious.

48:23.326 --> 48:25.454
The obvious?

48:29.458 --> 48:32.126
He watched him do it.

48:32.126 --> 48:34.380
He watched Peter Rumancek eat that girl.

48:36.297 --> 48:39.425
I see.

48:39.427 --> 48:41.469
Why do you think that?

48:41.471 --> 48:43.931
Did Francis Pullman tell you this?

48:49.393 --> 48:52.271
I mean, that was your
idea of a joke, right?

48:52.271 --> 48:54.817
Dropping the little bastard on my doorstep?

48:54.860 --> 48:57.818
It's not a sign,

48:57.820 --> 49:00.905
it's a goddamn billboard!

49:02.951 --> 49:06.538
But the rules are the rules, right?

49:11.500 --> 49:14.960
You don't take 'em down till
they turn, and when they do...

49:14.960 --> 49:18.172
you show no mercy.

49:23.179 --> 49:25.181
'Cause this isn't
about whether Peter Rumancek

49:25.181 --> 49:27.155
gutted those girls

49:27.181 --> 49:30.353
which, if it matters,

49:30.353 --> 49:32.813
I'm fairly certain he did not do.

49:35.192 --> 49:38.652
No, this is about what he is...

49:38.652 --> 49:41.402
and of that I have no doubt.

49:48.621 --> 49:51.375
So I'm gonna do this one
last thing for you.

49:55.001 --> 49:58.130
And then you and me...

50:00.132 --> 50:02.094
...we're through.

50:02.134 --> 50:04.135
Cheers.

50:40.422 --> 50:43.134
Where were you?

50:45.929 --> 50:49.347
Doesn't matter.

50:54.768 --> 50:57.315
If you were gonna run away...

50:57.315 --> 50:59.317
would you tell me?

51:02.068 --> 51:04.322
I'm not fast enough to outrun this.

51:09.327 --> 51:11.742
I need you to promise me something.

51:11.746 --> 51:13.706
I need you to promise me

51:13.748 --> 51:15.706
that you'll be home before sundown.

51:15.708 --> 51:17.460
I need you to promise me
that you'll be home before dark,

51:17.500 --> 51:19.920
and that someone is with you

51:19.920 --> 51:22.505
the whole night, until the sun comes up.

51:28.887 --> 51:31.474
What are you gonna do?

51:33.643 --> 51:35.768
I'm gonna kill it.

51:38.105 --> 51:40.635
You know you're just a person, right?

51:40.650 --> 51:42.650
That's what we all are.

51:42.652 --> 51:45.114
We're all just people.

51:45.152 --> 51:48.199
An hour before sundown, under no
circumstances do you leave the house!

51:48.199 --> 51:50.659
Under no circumstances
do you let anyone in!

51:50.701 --> 51:53.117
Then what?

51:53.121 --> 51:55.623
The next time I see you, you're in jail?

51:55.664 --> 51:58.418
At your funeral?

51:58.460 --> 52:00.757
Do I even see you again after that?

52:00.795 --> 52:03.797
I don't know.

52:03.838 --> 52:06.547
I think you're both fucking full of shit.

52:10.262 --> 52:13.597
You think I'm the one
that needs protecting?

52:13.597 --> 52:17.197
Look at you.

52:17.228 --> 52:19.559
Look at him.

52:19.563 --> 52:22.815
What do you need to happen
to make you realize

52:22.817 --> 52:24.818
this isn't some kind of game?

52:27.364 --> 52:29.449
This is life, Peter.

52:33.327 --> 52:35.663
I want to come with you.

52:35.704 --> 52:38.623
Either do as I say

52:38.664 --> 52:41.460
or I'll never see you again,
you stupid little bitch!

52:47.672 --> 52:49.635
That must be my dad.

52:49.677 --> 52:51.635
Then you should probably go.

53:06.735 --> 53:08.777
Fuck!
