02:05.191 --> 02:07.125
I'm Willie Dixon.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.627
And I'm making this here audio recording

02:09.729 --> 02:13.256
so that when you visit
Chess Recording Studio,

02:13.366 --> 02:15.334
you know the history.

02:15.435 --> 02:20.007
Now, the first time a gal took off her
underwear and threw them on stage

02:20.139 --> 02:23.202
it was on account of
a fella singing the blues.

02:23.309 --> 02:28.008
Now, when the white girls started doing it,
they called that rock and roll.

02:28.114 --> 02:32.278
Took a whole lot of people to make
the music that changed the world.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.946
Yes, sir. This story ain't just about me.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.256
<i>It all started with two men.</i>

02:45.632 --> 02:48.533
<i>One a white boy from Chicago.</i>

02:49.169 --> 02:51.330
Len, when are we getting married?

02:51.437 --> 02:52.768
<i>A witness for my Lord</i>

02:52.872 --> 02:56.137
<i>The other a sharecropper
from Mississippi.</i>

02:56.242 --> 02:58.836
<i>Say, who was a witness?</i>

02:58.945 --> 03:01.436
<i>The year was 1941.</i>

03:02.982 --> 03:05.143
<i>Say, Daniel was a witness</i>

03:06.953 --> 03:09.148
When are we getting married?

03:10.056 --> 03:11.353
I don't have the money.

03:11.457 --> 03:14.085
I told you I'd be fine without it.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.057
Well, I wouldn't.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.566
You don't know what it did to my father.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.800
I can't watch you go hungry.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.245
Da.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.522
Oh, how you doing, Mr. Feder?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.155
Hi, Dad.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.367
I want to marry her.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.401
Mr. Feder, I don't know if I told you,

04:01.507 --> 04:05.341
but I've been making plans to get out of
the junk business.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.039
I'm gonna open a club here.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.976
In the Negro neighborhood?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.110
Yeah. It's gonna be for Negroes.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.779
You're taking Shelly to Negro clubs?

04:18.891 --> 04:20.586
No, of course not.

04:21.527 --> 04:22.755
No, I'm just...

04:22.862 --> 04:26.263
I'd like you to know that
I'm making plans for the future.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.857
So, you are serious
about this marriage then?

04:28.968 --> 04:30.265
Yeah.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.398
I mean, when I can afford it.

04:32.505 --> 04:36.373
Your father and I, we come from
the same shithole in Poland.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.744
I didn't travel all this way

04:39.846 --> 04:43.873
to have my daughter marry some schmuck
from the same village.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.583
What did you say?

04:47.854 --> 04:49.344
- What did you say?
- Get in.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.752
Leonard.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.957
Don't worry where I'm from.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.723
My wife's gonna drive a Cadillac.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.604
Now, who is this here?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.545
Go on, get in the house now.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.344
McKinley Morganfield?

05:45.445 --> 05:46.412
Yes, sir?

05:46.512 --> 05:48.241
I'm Alan Lomax,

05:49.215 --> 05:51.615
and this is Mr. John Work
from Fisk University.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.084
- How you doing?
- Fine. You?

05:54.187 --> 05:57.748
I'm recording folk music
for the Library of Congress.

05:57.857 --> 05:58.949
Folk music?

06:00.727 --> 06:03.821
Could you move into the mike
a little bit for me? Thanks.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.795
Play that thing, man.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.225
That's what I sound like, huh?

06:35.328 --> 06:37.956
Yes, sir, that's what you sound like.

06:47.106 --> 06:50.337
Feel like I'm meeting myself
for the first time.

06:53.613 --> 06:57.310
<i>And he was. And he knew
it was a man he was meeting,</i>

06:58.151 --> 07:01.086
<i>too big for that slave
shack he was born in</i>

07:01.988 --> 07:04.548
<i>and too big for that plantation.</i>

07:19.572 --> 07:23.235
<i>Now, the acoustic guitar</i>
<i>was fine down south,</i>

07:23.342 --> 07:27.540
<i>because there's nothing but miles of</i>
<i>empty fields out your window.</i>

07:28.681 --> 07:33.482
<i>But in the city, with all
them streetcars and automobiles,</i>

07:34.253 --> 07:36.585
<i>you couldn't get yourself heard.</i>

07:38.090 --> 07:42.049
Hey, boy, ain't nobody want to hear
that sharecropping music.

07:43.262 --> 07:46.254
Take that shit back down there
to Mississippi.

07:50.703 --> 07:51.863
Hey.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.166
You're disturbing the peace!

08:02.615 --> 08:04.879
Why you want to cut me for, girl?

08:04.984 --> 08:08.385
You have been giving that same smile
to girls all morning.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.353
You must have three addresses
in your pocket.

08:10.456 --> 08:11.980
Addresses?

08:15.428 --> 08:16.622
No.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.955
- You're trouble. You know that?
- I know.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.658
How about you?

08:35.448 --> 08:38.746
You got to go, before my mama brings
the boys home. Come on.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.753
- Maybe those boys need a daddy.
- You're not daddy material.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.454
I'm not good enough for you?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.557
I don't talk as good as you
or something, huh?

08:55.401 --> 08:58.393
When I heard you start playing that music

08:59.705 --> 09:02.265
it took me someplace so good, Muddy.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.173
So good.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.542
Here you go, baby.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.817
Are you the owner of this club?

09:49.021 --> 09:50.352
Yes, I am.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.416
Isabella Allen. I make race records.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.353
Len Chess. How you doing? Wow.

09:56.462 --> 10:01.456
This is a beauty.
God, look at the lines on this thing.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.562
It's incredible.

10:04.203 --> 10:07.001
You can buy a car like this
making race records?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.301
If you find the right singer.

10:09.408 --> 10:12.844
Hey, I'd love to know
if you hear someone special.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.508
A record producer, huh?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.175
There'd be something in it for you.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.111
All right.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.779
Sweet. That's a beautiful car.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.347
You looking for girls?

10:26.359 --> 10:28.884
Excuse me? No, I'm opening a club.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.486
I don't mind you getting
men all liquored up

10:31.597 --> 10:34.327
but I lost two daughters to bluesmen.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.458
Dangerous business you in.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.584
What are you doing?

10:54.854 --> 10:59.018
<i>When Muddy met Little Walter,</i>
<i>he was just 17 years old,</i>

10:59.125 --> 11:02.424
<i>but he was the greatest harp
player that ever lived.</i>

11:02.528 --> 11:04.894
<i>That's it. That's all of it.</i>

11:08.267 --> 11:10.565
- Yeah, man.
- Play that for me.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.103
I'll give you $1
if you let me strum that guitar.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.613
I can busk more than your dollar.

11:23.716 --> 11:26.184
- I'll give you $2.
- You a headhunter?

11:26.285 --> 11:29.482
You fixing to chop my head off
with my own guitar? Man.

11:29.588 --> 11:32.022
Shit, you can't play better than me.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.285
Let me see the guitar, man.

12:15.267 --> 12:18.259
Hey, big guy,
your daddy sure can cook, huh?

12:19.038 --> 12:21.598
You're not gonna take care of Walter?

12:21.707 --> 12:23.231
Oh, I don't drink none of that.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.708
Good for you, Walter.
I'll make you a nice bath.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.745
Okay, thank you, ma'am.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.542
Why you got a gun?

12:29.915 --> 12:33.510
- In case in any good guys need shooting.
- You mean the bad guys?

12:36.322 --> 12:38.222
I is the bad guy.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.586
Hush now, scaring my boys,
and let me hear some of that harp.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.060
Okay, okay.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.068
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.609
- Where in the hell you going?
- Follow me now. Come on.

12:58.711 --> 13:02.272
No, no, no. No, look here.
You follow this guitar, son.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.678
"Son"?

13:05.985 --> 13:09.716
You can play the shit out of that guitar,
so I'll follow you anywhere you want,

13:11.257 --> 13:14.124
but don't you ever be
calling me no "son."

13:14.226 --> 13:15.488
Okay?

13:16.362 --> 13:19.889
- I don't need no daddy.
- No, boy, what you need is a mama.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.264
Someone who will feed you and clothe you

13:23.369 --> 13:25.837
and tell you to get
your behind in that bath.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.429
Well, you know what they say, now.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.466
A man can't have too many mamas.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.410
And you don't need this. You need soap.

13:40.886 --> 13:42.649
He fit me, Geneva.

13:43.522 --> 13:44.716
I heard.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.525
He fit me.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.892
<i>They was a family now.</i>

13:51.397 --> 13:54.366
<i>Little Walter, Muddy Waters</i>
<i>and Jimmy Rogers</i>

13:54.533 --> 13:57.400
<i>called themselves
"The All-Star Trio,"</i>

13:57.503 --> 14:00.836
<i>but everybody else knew</i>
<i>them as "The Headhunters"</i>

14:01.006 --> 14:03.668
<i>on account of how</i>
<i>they sliced their competition.</i>

14:05.177 --> 14:07.270
Will you help me out here?

14:13.719 --> 14:16.916
- Get your own gig, motherfucker!
- Let them play!

14:41.213 --> 14:43.477
- Get out of the way, Mud.
- Fucking son of a bitch!

14:43.582 --> 14:45.641
This is between me and this motherfucker.
Get out the way, Mud.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.844
- Son...
- I told you never to be calling me that.

14:47.953 --> 14:51.081
I know you did. But we family now.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.953
Then what the fuck you doing, Mud?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.787
Give me that pistol.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.762
I ain't trying to boss you.
But you're just too good to lose.

14:59.164 --> 15:03.533
We'll burn Chicago down if you don't
get your ass locked up or killed.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.434
- You think I never used this before?
- I know you did.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.972
Then you know I'll shoot
this whole motherfucker up then.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.475
But you ain't got to use it tonight.
If he foolish enough to come after you

15:12.578 --> 15:15.376
I'll put the bullet in him my damn self.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.352
You a crazy motherfucker, Mud.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.220
Run, motherfucker! Run!

15:27.326 --> 15:29.294
You can get out of here, too.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.192
I'll talk this peckerwood
into not calling the police.

15:31.297 --> 15:32.423
Oh, okay.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.529
Sorry about that, chief.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.634
Sorry about the damage, boss.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.174
Yeah, you fucked up my place. You...

15:44.276 --> 15:46.506
Yes, sir. It's a damn shame, boss.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.512
Just get out.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.051
Here. There you go.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.348
Appreciate it.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.919
Fucked up my shit.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.755
Ain't never see them pitchers?
Here's how you do it.

16:04.863 --> 16:07.491
When you get that ball,
you gonna kick that leg over.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.796
You gonna throw that thing
way up there like that.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.235
Been looking all over for you.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.405
We're just here working, sir.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.100
I thought we was all right, boss.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.509
Stop talking to me
like I'm some damn plantation owner.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.843
What the fuck you want then?

16:25.517 --> 16:27.382
I want to put you on a record.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.420
- A record?
- Yeah, that's right.

16:29.521 --> 16:30.920
You're kidding.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.547
No, sir, boss.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.120
Let me get this straight now.

16:39.231 --> 16:43.167
We shoot up half your whole joint,
and now you want to put us on a record.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.168
Yeah, that's right.

16:45.270 --> 16:47.636
I hear good things about you.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.800
- When do you want to do this?
- Right now. The studio's booked.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.605
- But I got to get my band.
- No, you don't.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.738
Not the crazy harp-playing motherfucker,
you don't. No. Just you.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.680
You want to do this?

16:59.318 --> 17:01.252
- Yeah.
- Come on. Studio's booked.

17:01.353 --> 17:05.449
<i>Well, I'm going away to leave</i>
<i>Won't be back no more</i>

17:06.125 --> 17:08.388
<i>Going back down south, child...</i>

17:08.894 --> 17:12.386
<i>Now, Leonard Chess didn't</i>
<i>worry none about skin color.</i>

17:12.998 --> 17:15.262
<i>It was the color of them
bills that mattered.</i>

17:16.135 --> 17:18.660
<i>Just get you enough
green to cover yourself</i>

17:18.936 --> 17:21.701
<i>and then you ain't
no Jew-boy no more.</i>

17:22.007 --> 17:24.531
<i>And you ain't no
colored boy either.</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:26.902
<i>You're just a man with a Cadillac.</i>

17:27.012 --> 17:28.172
It's so beautiful!

17:30.549 --> 17:33.712
- Do we have enough?
- Hi, baby. Stop with the "enough."

17:33.819 --> 17:36.219
This is America. The word is "more."

17:36.321 --> 17:38.221
I like the way your husband thinks.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.553
You must be Muddy.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.389
I'm Revetta. I love your record.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.889
Thank you. Pleasure to meet you.

17:49.435 --> 17:52.233
I packed for a week. Will that be enough?

17:52.771 --> 17:54.363
Yeah, that ought to be good.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.840
I think she's asking,
how long are you gonna be gone.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.173
Come here. Hey.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.440
Close your eyes.

18:05.184 --> 18:08.312
A little friend to keep you company
while I'm gone.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.081
There you go.

18:12.825 --> 18:16.659
- Can we afford this?
- Don't worry about it. It's classy.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.229
Thank you.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.432
I tell you, that's a whole lot of ocean.

18:22.534 --> 18:25.628
Take a hell of a lot
to get me to cross it.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.998
How come you didn't stay your ass
in Poland?

18:31.677 --> 18:34.908
How come you didn't stay your ass
in Mississippi?

18:37.649 --> 18:40.812
<i>Len knew the only way</i>
<i>to make it big was radio.</i>

18:41.420 --> 18:45.117
<i>And that meant taking</i>
<i>Muddy back down South.</i>

18:49.061 --> 18:52.155
- Thank you very much.
- The man don't need no more Scotch.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.137
I got a hell of a mortgage.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.172
Shit.

19:04.276 --> 19:06.335
Yeah, I got one of those.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.845
I tell you what.
Throw this record on the table.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.107
It pays off everybody's.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.375
Leonard...

19:11.483 --> 19:14.782
If people buy Muddy's record,
I got to make more.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.615
Then I'm into you every month.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.884
Yeah, but I got to be fair, you know.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.051
I know you got to be fair.

19:22.828 --> 19:27.094
The motherfuckers bring in the
Glenfiddich and the Johnnie Walker.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.862
But you got to ask yourself,

19:29.968 --> 19:33.096
do they really stand up
to Jackson and Grant?

19:50.722 --> 19:52.713
I don't bribe deejays.

19:53.625 --> 19:54.785
I do.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.026
You realize he doesn't care
about your music.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.257
It's just about the money with him.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.233
<i>Everybody, this is the newest race
music right out of Chicago.</i>

20:05.704 --> 20:07.604
You're on your own.

20:17.015 --> 20:22.146
<i>Now, in the South, whites and coloreds</i>
<i>didn't ride around in the same car</i>

20:23.021 --> 20:25.683
<i>unless the colored
man was chauffeuring.</i>

20:25.791 --> 20:27.884
Fuck Mississippi police.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.029
You got to bless them.

20:40.138 --> 20:43.005
- All right, easy. Thank you.
- Hey, you gotta bless them.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.667
- It's very good.
- Room service.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.984
Well, hello.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.850
- We heard you on the radio.
- Come on in.

21:01.526 --> 21:04.188
No, he don't bite. And I don't either.

21:06.231 --> 21:07.823
Play it, Daddy.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.625
Yeah.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.694
Don't rush it.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.210
Don't step on it now.
That's Chicago's heartbeat.

21:19.978 --> 21:21.411
Go on, now.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.650
You've got such hair.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.343
Play that for me, Daddy.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.820
I lied to you, girl.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.652
Yeah, I like that.

21:37.829 --> 21:42.596
- Where you going? Don't leave us alone.
- I'll swing one over your way.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.362
I'm married.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.767
Yeah, and they ain't redhead.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.699
That's bullshit.

21:53.345 --> 21:56.974
Yeah, that's right. Come on, Daddy.
Come on back.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.811
Preacher lay his Bible down.

22:02.788 --> 22:06.121
We're coming straight to you
from down in the Delta

22:08.460 --> 22:11.156
with Muddy Waters and his hit record.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.461
That's right. Sunshine, how you doing?

22:13.565 --> 22:17.729
I want to say a big hello, if I can,
to everybody down in Coahoma County.

22:17.836 --> 22:21.431
They got a whole mess of bluesmen
working Mississippi fields.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.134
When I was out there I used to sing...

22:24.242 --> 22:27.700
<i>Time don't get no better</i>

22:27.813 --> 22:30.145
<i>Up the road I'm going</i>

22:30.415 --> 22:33.942
So, you know,
I want to thank old Len Chess here for

22:34.286 --> 22:36.277
giving Muddy Water a chance to shine.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.583
Does that mean you're staying
where you are?

22:38.690 --> 22:41.352
Because I know some labels down here
who'd love to snap you up.

22:41.460 --> 22:45.954
Well, they can try all they want to,
but I belong to the Chess family.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.790
We're gonna play a little something
from Muddy Waters right now.

22:48.900 --> 22:49.389
Lay it on me.

22:50.769 --> 22:53.533
It was kind, what you said on the radio.

22:53.638 --> 22:58.632
You know, starting a business together,
it is like starting a family.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.405
Appreciate that.

23:00.712 --> 23:05.308
Yeah, well, how come, then,
you need me to sign this thing?

23:08.186 --> 23:10.677
That's what people do in business.

23:12.491 --> 23:15.927
You know, you got a
power with that guitar.

23:16.928 --> 23:20.489
Amazing. It even put three women
in your bed last night.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.567
Yeah, but you married.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.761
I like another kind of broad.
Does that bother you?

23:25.871 --> 23:27.099
What's that gonna bother me for?

23:27.205 --> 23:31.403
I'm just saying, it doesn't make me
like them. And that's not me.

23:31.510 --> 23:33.137
I'm not that.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.071
Who is you?

23:37.349 --> 23:39.613
Sign the contract and find out.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.146
You got a pen there?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.585
All right.

23:43.688 --> 23:46.953
This is the newest race music
right out of Chicago.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.561
And I want you to remember this name.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.220
Muddy Waters.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.257
The last time I signed something
like this, I got married.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.700
Well, that's what this is.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.772
Till death do us part.

24:04.543 --> 24:07.376
By the way, the car's yours.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.708
- What do you mean?
- You earned it.

24:29.868 --> 24:31.768
Muddy! Listen!

24:31.970 --> 24:36.339
<i>Now playing Muddy Waters'</i>
Can't Be Satisfied, <i>WGES Chicago.</i>

24:36.441 --> 24:37.669
It's you!

24:40.312 --> 24:42.177
- Come on in here.
- No! I got to go to work!

24:42.280 --> 24:45.807
- Come on in, Mama.
- Muddy, don't! Muddy!

25:03.468 --> 25:05.527
<i>On a Sunday night,</i>

25:05.637 --> 25:08.504
<i>when no one happened
to be in Len's club,</i>

25:08.607 --> 25:12.099
<i>the Macomba mysteriously
burned down.</i>

25:16.882 --> 25:18.076
Hi, Daddy.

25:18.183 --> 25:22.085
<i>He put the insurance money</i>
<i>into this here recording studio.</i>

25:25.624 --> 25:26.591
Hi.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.355
Hi, baby. Hi, there. How you doing?

25:32.163 --> 25:34.495
Look. It's coming along, huh?

25:36.601 --> 25:40.093
- We're late on our mortgage again, Len.
- Yeah.

25:40.539 --> 25:44.373
- It's gonna have to wait.
- You're gambling our home.

25:44.976 --> 25:49.470
- Yeah. And we're gonna win big.
- And if we don't?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.143
I won't let you down, babe.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.382
I won't let you down.

25:56.488 --> 26:00.185
- Dave, show her the... Spin the thing.
- Sure thing.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.850
You see this?

26:05.397 --> 26:08.833
<i>Chess Records was the best studio</i>
<i>in Chicago.</i>

26:08.934 --> 26:10.925
<i>Had a sound nobody could touch.</i>

26:11.036 --> 26:12.833
Tie me up. Come on.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.569
- Did everybody see?
- You guys better watch out now.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.205
Little Walter getting electrified!

26:25.750 --> 26:28.048
He's amplifying a fucking harmonica.

26:28.153 --> 26:31.213
Wait, Chess. Let him try it.
Watch it now.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.723
- All right. Go ahead.
- Take one.

26:34.259 --> 26:38.719
<i>Forty days and forty nights</i>

26:39.397 --> 26:42.195
<i>Since my baby left this town</i>

26:44.202 --> 26:46.932
He's blowing all over Muddy's vocals.
I got to cut.

26:47.038 --> 26:48.505
No, hold on.

26:49.474 --> 26:52.136
<i>But the rain keep coming down</i>

26:55.747 --> 26:58.682
<i>She my life, I need her so</i>

26:59.684 --> 27:01.879
<i>Why she left I just don't know</i>

27:01.987 --> 27:03.011
Let it ride.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.021
You can't record a record
with harmonica all over the place.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.112
Yeah, we can.

27:06.257 --> 27:07.622
<i>Forty days...</i>

27:07.726 --> 27:08.784
Okay.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.724
<i>and forty nights</i>

27:11.229 --> 27:13.993
<i>Since I set right down and cried</i>

27:16.334 --> 27:19.269
<i>Keep raining all the time</i>

27:20.238 --> 27:22.900
<i>But the river running dry</i>

27:26.678 --> 27:29.272
<i>Lord help me, it just ain't right</i>

27:30.415 --> 27:33.248
<i>I love that girl
with all of my might</i>

27:37.622 --> 27:39.021
It works.

27:41.092 --> 27:43.253
Now that's a record.

27:43.361 --> 27:44.828
- You like that?
- Yeah.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.521
Walter got a record. Let's lay it down.

27:46.631 --> 27:49.759
- Oh, yeah?
- You want to hear?

27:49.868 --> 27:51.995
Why don't you and Jimmy back him up?

27:52.103 --> 27:55.072
You caught me on a good day.
Where's Belo at?

27:55.173 --> 27:56.640
Take one.

28:23.668 --> 28:25.465
Boss, this your new shit?

28:25.570 --> 28:28.232
Yeah. You like it, huh?

28:28.873 --> 28:31.273
- Go park it, motherfucker.
- What?

28:31.643 --> 28:33.577
Park it at your house.

28:37.148 --> 28:40.345
Oh, Jenny, you see this shit?
Wait till these motherfuckers see me now.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.285
- You my white daddy?
- You're getting carried away again.

28:43.388 --> 28:47.791
Man, oh, man. Oh, boy.
Black folks riding around in Cadillacs.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.359
Feel like I died and gone to heaven.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.089
Walter, this is Willie Dixon.
He's gonna write some songs for us.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.461
- How you doing?
- I like what you do with that harp, man.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.261
- Wrote a killer song for you.
- You did?

28:56.367 --> 28:58.597
I know how the girls love you so much.
It's called <i>My Babe.</i>

28:58.703 --> 29:02.161
<i>My Babe?</i> This is my
babe right here. Come on, girl.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.904
Hey, Len, I wrote a song for Muddy, too.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.638
Oh, yeah? Muddy don't need no help.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.647
Oh, man.
I admit he's good and everything,

29:10.749 --> 29:13.513
but, I mean,
all his songs sound the damn same.

29:14.085 --> 29:17.248
Muddy Waters needs something
that shows him off.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.346
Well, we'll see what you got.

29:22.026 --> 29:24.324
Here's your riff right there.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.095
Ain't nothing to that.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.134
<i>Gypsy woman told my mother</i>

29:33.438 --> 29:35.372
<i>Before I was born</i>

29:37.442 --> 29:39.273
<i>You got you a boy child coming...</i>

29:39.377 --> 29:42.676
<i>Now Muddy was Muddy</i>
<i>way before I came along.</i>

29:43.448 --> 29:45.245
<i>I just took his persona</i>

29:45.350 --> 29:48.786
<i>and put it in words</i>
<i>that everybody could understand.</i>

29:49.554 --> 29:53.422
<i>I mean, it was simple. He was
the cat every man wanted to be</i>

29:53.525 --> 29:55.925
<i>and every woman wanted to love.</i>

29:56.928 --> 29:58.293
<i>And Muddy,</i>

29:58.396 --> 30:01.524
<i>well, he just kept
growing into that man.</i>

30:02.600 --> 30:05.626
<i>Everybody knows I'm him</i>

30:10.508 --> 30:13.841
<i>Well, you know I'm the
hoochie coochie man</i>

30:15.213 --> 30:18.182
<i>Everybody knows I'm him</i>

30:24.589 --> 30:26.557
<i>I got a black cat bone</i>

30:27.892 --> 30:29.689
<i>I got a mojo, too</i>

30:31.296 --> 30:33.127
<i>I got the Johnny conkeroo</i>

30:34.399 --> 30:36.264
<i>I'm gonna mess with you</i>

30:37.836 --> 30:39.633
<i>I'm gonna make you girls</i>

30:41.272 --> 30:43.103
<i>Lead me by my hand</i>

30:44.676 --> 30:46.303
<i>Then the world will know...</i>

30:47.278 --> 30:50.611
<i>People started realizing</i>
<i>that if you can play the guitar</i>

30:50.748 --> 30:54.844
<i>and sing your ass off,</i>
<i>you could be badder than Superman.</i>

30:55.587 --> 30:59.853
<i>And that was a strong feeling</i>
<i>for a black man in the '50s.</i>

31:06.998 --> 31:08.260
How you doing, darling?

31:16.341 --> 31:18.172
<i>On the seventh hour</i>

31:19.477 --> 31:21.377
<i>On the seventh day</i>

31:22.747 --> 31:24.510
<i>On the seventh month</i>

31:26.017 --> 31:27.882
<i>Seven doctors say</i>

31:29.454 --> 31:31.513
<i>He was born for good luck</i>

31:32.991 --> 31:34.891
<i>That you'll see</i>

31:36.127 --> 31:38.152
<i>I got seven hundred dollar</i>

31:38.930 --> 31:41.364
<i>Don't you mess with me</i>

31:45.103 --> 31:48.664
I'm about to lay this down right
now, boss. I'm ready.

31:53.845 --> 31:56.370
You're messing up my groove, boss.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.785
Who dead?

32:05.223 --> 32:06.690
Your mother.

32:07.392 --> 32:09.826
Your family called a deejay
down in New Orleans.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.328
They've been trying to find you.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.800
Maybe you need to take a little time off.

32:20.505 --> 32:22.439
What am I supposed to do with that, boss?

32:22.540 --> 32:24.770
Go home and bury your mother.

32:27.312 --> 32:28.574
Walter.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.445
<i>Y'all ready?</i>

32:32.116 --> 32:33.344
Shit.

32:36.454 --> 32:40.584
I was in my groove, man.
Now I can't even find my shit.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.763
Go home. Nobody's expecting you
to go back in there.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.491
I'm expecting it.

32:50.501 --> 32:54.198
You know how many harp players out there
are waiting to chop my head?

32:56.140 --> 32:58.734
Not time to be wasting on this woman.

32:59.844 --> 33:03.280
That ain't "that woman."
That's your mama, boy.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.679
What the hell I know about mamas?

33:08.586 --> 33:11.680
She let my daddy give me away
the day I was born.

33:11.789 --> 33:15.122
Well, she did the best
she could, I reckon.

33:15.226 --> 33:17.751
That's why this here be my mama.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.797
This here, right here.

33:21.899 --> 33:23.161
You know, Walter.

33:23.267 --> 33:26.134
You and me not gonna wake up
every morning and get everything we want.

33:26.237 --> 33:28.865
Mostly we got to take what come.

33:28.973 --> 33:32.465
And half the time,
that's gonna be a bunch of bullshit.

33:34.879 --> 33:38.838
Yeah. I just got to
get my mind back right.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.781
Go on and have you a taste.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.121
I don't need that.
That shit'll fuck me up.

33:45.223 --> 33:48.056
- Go on, boy.
- It's gonna fuck me up, man.

33:48.159 --> 33:49.592
Cool you out.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.321
Just a taste, huh?

33:58.302 --> 33:59.564
Fuck it.

34:11.449 --> 34:16.112
<i>My baby don't stand
no cheating, my babe</i>

34:17.455 --> 34:22.255
<i>Oh, yeah, she don't stand
no cheating My babe</i>

34:23.494 --> 34:26.224
<i>Oh, yeah,
she don't stand no cheating</i>

34:26.330 --> 34:29.493
<i>She don't stand none</i>
<i>of that midnight creeping</i>

34:29.600 --> 34:32.068
I can't record this
if he handles the mike like that.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.001
Don't worry about it.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.771
We're playing Little
Walter's <i>My Babe.</i>

34:39.877 --> 34:42.437
<i>Number one on the
charts this week.</i>

34:42.947 --> 34:45.643
<i>Little Walter was making
a name for himself.</i>

34:46.083 --> 34:48.018
<i>Every club on the chitlin circuit</i>

34:48.119 --> 34:51.987
<i>wanted that sharp,</i>
<i>swinging jump boy in the Cadillac.</i>

34:53.157 --> 34:56.284
Now, ain't that sure enough
a goddamn shame?

34:56.627 --> 35:00.063
- What is that?
- A big-time recording artist like Little Walter

35:00.164 --> 35:04.362
driving around in that broken-down,
no-account short.

35:05.636 --> 35:07.831
- Let me out.
- Hold on, son.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.897
What is he doing now?

35:11.509 --> 35:15.240
"Little Walter and the motherfucking Jukes,"
huh? Ain't this some shit?

35:15.346 --> 35:19.214
Say, now, which one of you motherfuckers
is Little Walter?

35:19.317 --> 35:20.750
I am, fool.

35:21.986 --> 35:23.214
Okay.

35:26.357 --> 35:28.348
Bring your ass over here!

35:34.532 --> 35:36.261
Motherfucker taking
money out of my pocket.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.460
So what? He's stealing your gigs.

35:38.569 --> 35:40.434
He's stealing my name.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.231
Shit.

35:42.340 --> 35:46.640
<i>My baby don't stand no cheating,
my babe</i>

35:48.446 --> 35:53.315
<i>Oh, no, she don't stand no cheating</i>
<i>My babe</i>

35:54.385 --> 35:57.354
<i>Oh, no, she don't stand no cheating</i>

35:57.455 --> 36:00.447
<i>Everything she do she do so pleasing</i>

36:00.558 --> 36:01.957
<i>My baby...</i>

36:02.059 --> 36:05.586
<i>It was 1955 and we was hooked.</i>

36:06.230 --> 36:10.894
<i>On the music, on the cars,</i>
<i>on the women, on the life, baby.</i>

36:11.002 --> 36:13.630
<i>Oh, Lord, we had hot hands!</i>

36:13.738 --> 36:17.265
<i>... she don't stand no fooling, my babe</i>

36:18.609 --> 36:21.703
<i>Oh, yeah, she don't stand no fooling</i>

36:21.812 --> 36:24.872
<i>When she's hot, there ain't no cooling</i>

36:24.982 --> 36:29.214
<i>My babe, true little baby, my babe</i>

36:29.320 --> 36:32.289
<i>- True little baby</i>

36:53.611 --> 36:54.976
<i>True little baby</i>

36:56.547 --> 36:57.809
<i>True little baby</i>

36:58.182 --> 37:01.345
Hey, Mud. I want you to meet Wolf.

37:02.453 --> 37:05.251
Yeah, I hear we're from the same place.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.453
Is that right?

37:09.327 --> 37:10.817
Yeah, Wolf just signed with us.

37:10.928 --> 37:12.919
Yeah. Welcome to Cadillac Records.

37:13.030 --> 37:16.193
You stay around long enough,
everybody get one.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.464
Well, this old truck,

37:20.238 --> 37:21.796
I own it.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.069
It don't own me.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.603
Listen, I want to offer
you a $100 advance.

37:29.714 --> 37:32.478
I don't borrow against the store.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.211
You just pay me what you owe me.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.048
That's fair enough.

37:38.055 --> 37:39.454
Nice meeting y'all.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.684
Take care of yourself, baby.

37:53.170 --> 37:54.296
"It don't own me."

37:54.405 --> 37:56.737
Motherfucker thinks
he goddamn John Wayne.

37:56.841 --> 37:57.933
He can sing, though.

37:58.042 --> 38:01.375
He gonna have to, because he
ain't getting the women on style.

38:01.479 --> 38:04.812
Any royalties come in
from <i>Hoochie Coochie Man?</i>

38:04.915 --> 38:07.145
I already gave that to you.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.410
How you figure?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.419
The Cadillac ain't free, Mud.

38:15.593 --> 38:16.753
Right.

38:17.361 --> 38:18.953
You need money?

38:21.465 --> 38:23.729
Well, Geneva want a house.

38:26.837 --> 38:28.737
I'll take care of it.

38:29.907 --> 38:31.272

38:33.511 --> 38:35.172
<i>All you pretty women</i>

38:36.647 --> 38:38.274
<i>Stand in line</i>

38:39.183 --> 38:40.650

38:42.153 --> 38:43.711
<i>In an hour's time</i>

38:45.122 --> 38:47.022
<i>Ain't that amazing?</i>

39:06.844 --> 39:08.869
Where that baby come from?

39:11.082 --> 39:13.016
A woman came by today.

39:13.818 --> 39:15.683
She said she's yours.

39:16.754 --> 39:19.587
She said she couldn't take care
of her anymore.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.453
That's my baby?

40:06.704 --> 40:08.729
She's gonna need milk.

40:18.482 --> 40:20.746
I'll go on and get the milk.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.649
<i>I'm a man</i>

you're making, Geneva.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.536
Thank you, Walter.

40:46.510 --> 40:49.240
That's why Muddy can go out there
and fetch the world.

40:49.346 --> 40:51.280
He's got big dreams.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.350
Here, let me help you.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.451
- There, go ahead...
- What about you, though? Come on.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.955
You ain't got no dreams, girl?

41:00.558 --> 41:03.288
Somebody's got to have their feet
firmly planted on the ground.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.919
That's you, huh? That's you?

41:06.497 --> 41:09.364
Well, I say you take them off the ground.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.713

41:56.814 --> 41:59.408
- I'm Muddy's woman.
- He got a lot of women.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.410
He can spare one, huh?

42:04.688 --> 42:06.986
I'm sorry. I know.

42:07.391 --> 42:10.019
I know I'm a motherfucker. I know.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.991
You got no idea. I can't help myself.

You know?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.563
Let me make you happy, baby.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.967

42:28.779 --> 42:30.508
You have no idea

42:32.283 --> 42:34.751
how good that man has been to me.

42:41.825 --> 42:43.622
I'm half a woman, Walter.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.864
I can't have any more babies.

42:53.337 --> 42:57.637
I can't give Muddy any
children of his own.

42:58.142 --> 42:59.905
- Don't cry, baby. Don't cry.
- No.

43:03.347 --> 43:06.646
Don't ever talk to me
about any of his other women.

43:07.184 --> 43:08.549
Ever.

43:08.652 --> 43:09.778
Okay.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.388
Hey, Geneva.

43:13.791 --> 43:15.315
Hey, baby.

43:16.927 --> 43:20.328
You must be hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

43:25.903 --> 43:27.165
Yeah.

43:53.097 --> 43:55.065

44:01.238 --> 44:02.865
He ain't hungry.

44:03.374 --> 44:05.035
You ain't hungry?

44:08.012 --> 44:10.981
You ain't eat nothing.
What, you ain't hungry?

44:13.617 --> 44:15.448
- Son?
- Muddy.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.583
You ain't hungry? Son?

44:22.493 --> 44:25.519
- Muddy, he's just a kid!
- You better know I know it.

44:25.996 --> 44:28.191
I'll put a motherfucking
lacing on you, boy.

44:28.298 --> 44:31.893
Now, you better go on somewhere
and sleep it off. You hear me?

45:12.676 --> 45:13.870
Hubert, sir.

45:13.977 --> 45:15.308
<i>"Hubert"?</i>

45:16.346 --> 45:17.677
<i>Walter, behave yourself.</i>

45:17.781 --> 45:19.681
<i>- Motherfucker's name is Hubert.</i>
<i>- Shut up.</i>

45:19.783 --> 45:22.650

<i>playing that loud?</i>

45:22.753 --> 45:25.381
Yeah, lower the amp, not the guitar.
The amp.

45:25.489 --> 45:27.389
<i>Get it right, Hubert.</i>

45:27.491 --> 45:29.618
Don't talk to him no more.

45:31.895 --> 45:33.692
I'm the band leader.

45:34.598 --> 45:37.658
Reckon you ain't never
worked with one before.

45:38.836 --> 45:43.432
You want something done, you ask me.
I'm gonna tell him what he has to be doing.

45:44.608 --> 45:46.269
Is that right?

45:47.778 --> 45:48.938
That's right.

45:49.046 --> 45:53.278
Only thing you can do. That's a
mean motherfucker right there. Shit.

45:54.218 --> 45:55.776
Get it right.

45:56.687 --> 45:58.882
- All right, big man.
- Go and get your coat.

45:58.989 --> 46:00.183
Okay, then.

46:00.290 --> 46:01.655
<i>Take two.</i>

46:03.127 --> 46:04.617
Hey, baby.

46:05.629 --> 46:07.426
Why don't you stay for a while?

46:07.531 --> 46:10.159
Better get your girl out of the ring.

46:20.310 --> 46:24.303
<i>Oh, smokestack lightning</i>

46:24.414 --> 46:27.611
No, that's all right.
You can have her, baby.

46:28.352 --> 46:30.115
But she come with this.

46:30.220 --> 46:34.156
- He can't hear you, Mud.
- I guarantee you he hear me.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.734
Hey, Jimmy, come here.

46:51.175 --> 46:54.838
I want you to tell Hubert we'll pay
him twice what Wolf's paying him.

46:54.945 --> 46:56.640
If he's such a band leader,

46:56.747 --> 47:00.410
we'll see if he's band leader enough
to hold onto his boy.

47:02.319 --> 47:05.652
<i>He was the big, bad wolf.</i>

47:05.756 --> 47:09.248
<i>Now, the story is he got his name</i>
<i>from a dead man</i>

47:09.359 --> 47:12.522

<i>and tuned his guitar.</i>

47:12.629 --> 47:15.826
<i>And he been howling</i>

<i>Oh, stop your train</i>

<i>Let a poor boy ride</i>

47:24.308 --> 47:27.243
<i>Whoa, don't you hear me crying?</i>

47:34.785 --> 47:36.946
- You all right?
- Couldn't you get a smaller set?

47:39.890 --> 47:40.914
- You all right?
- Hurry up, man.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.720

I love this house.

47:46.230 --> 47:48.721
- You got it.
- Sorry, Jimmy.

47:50.300 --> 47:52.291
Y'all can't come in here.

47:52.769 --> 47:53.861
I'm Chuck Berry.

47:53.971 --> 47:56.735
Chuck Berry's a
country-and-western singer.

47:59.176 --> 48:00.473
Is he?

48:01.778 --> 48:04.269
You know who else he is? He's me.

You guys know that "nigger" ain't

49:56.059 --> 49:58.425
Oh, pardon. I'm sorry.

Okay. Let me help you out.
You got to sound that shit out.

50:29.059 --> 50:32.028
- Motherfucker!
- Hey!

50:32.729 --> 50:35.391
You're gonna need a new car, nigger.

50:36.666 --> 50:38.566
That's what I've been
telling this motherfucker.

50:38.668 --> 50:41.694
Shut up, shut up. Would you stop?
Are you fucking with cops now?

50:41.805 --> 50:43.033
God damn it.

50:43.673 --> 50:45.971
What's the matter with you?

50:47.778 --> 50:50.076
- Are you all right, man?
- Damn it.

50:50.180 --> 50:53.081
I had no business being
that pretty anyway.

50:58.088 --> 50:59.521
It looks like I need a new car, Len.

50:59.623 --> 51:02.956
I gave you a new car.
You rip the fucking doors off it?

51:03.060 --> 51:04.357
It's not my problem!

51:04.461 --> 51:06.486
I gave you a number-one record, Len.

51:06.596 --> 51:09.064
I gave you a chance to make
a number-one fucking record.

51:09.166 --> 51:11.327
Oh, you gave the little nigger
a chance, huh?

51:11.435 --> 51:13.926
Little nigger don't need no chance!

51:14.671 --> 51:16.969
I can play, motherfucker!

51:17.074 --> 51:19.099
I'm fucking king on this shit!

51:19.209 --> 51:21.109
You think I'm gonna shoot you?

51:21.211 --> 51:24.112
- Get some rest.
- No, I need a new car.

51:24.748 --> 51:28.582
Enough! What you need to do
is get back to the Pepsi-Cola, boy.

51:28.685 --> 51:31.677
Let me tell you,
that liquor ain't for you.

51:31.788 --> 51:34.552
What you gonna do, Mud?
You gonna hit me, Mud?

51:34.658 --> 51:37.388
You gonna choke me now? On the street?

51:38.628 --> 51:40.186
Get off me.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.867
You know,

51:45.702 --> 51:47.169
that Wolf,

51:49.039 --> 51:51.735
the way he stood up for his sideman,

51:53.743 --> 51:56.371
maybe he could teach you something, Mud.

52:00.784 --> 52:02.479
Esther, come on!

52:06.256 --> 52:08.918
Find yourself another harp player.

52:17.567 --> 52:20.035
<i>Well, baby, you know</i>
<i>I can never be satisfied</i>

52:20.303 --> 52:23.739
<i>And I just can't keep from crying</i>

52:25.742 --> 52:27.300
<i>Lay it on, man.</i>

52:35.919 --> 52:38.410
<i>Hubert Sumlin,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

53:04.447 --> 53:07.109
- What you want, miss?
- Tell Pot that I ain't leaving.

53:07.217 --> 53:09.549
Pot! Your girl said she ain't leaving.

53:09.653 --> 53:13.316
I want your things out of my room
when I get home. I told you.

53:18.061 --> 53:21.155
You can't hide from the eye of God.

53:21.998 --> 53:23.966
He hunting heads tonight.

53:38.448 --> 53:41.906
Muddy, I don't think
I want to be in your band no more.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.347
You steal him from me again,

53:46.690 --> 53:48.180
I'll kill you.

53:54.197 --> 53:55.357
He tell you I quit?

53:55.465 --> 53:58.730
He said he felt like
somebody took away his oxygen.

54:01.004 --> 54:02.198
Walter.

54:03.940 --> 54:05.430
You're family.

54:06.643 --> 54:08.634
You don't have to do this.

54:12.616 --> 54:14.311
I'm gonna miss you.

54:33.403 --> 54:38.534
<i>When you lose that cat that gave you</i>
<i>that sound that nobody else could,</i>

54:40.043 --> 54:41.271
<i>it hurts.</i>

54:41.378 --> 54:43.778
<i>Hurts more than losing your woman.</i>

54:56.760 --> 54:58.728
It's good you brought him in.

54:58.828 --> 55:00.921
See what I was telling you, baby?

55:01.031 --> 55:02.658
He's different.

55:02.766 --> 55:05.530
I don't know, Len.
He sound a little country to me.

55:05.635 --> 55:07.535
Maybe we blues him up just a little bit.

55:07.637 --> 55:08.797
Willie.

55:09.506 --> 55:12.805
I don't want you to blues this up.
This ain't the blues.

55:12.909 --> 55:16.367
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but we're gonna record it.

55:16.479 --> 55:18.106
- There you go, baby.
- Yeah.

55:35.832 --> 55:38.596
Hey. Hey there, girl.

55:40.370 --> 55:41.667
Tell Chess

55:44.107 --> 55:45.734
I need a new car.

55:46.976 --> 55:48.807
This ain't the right color.

55:54.250 --> 55:55.911
You got something real special.

55:56.019 --> 55:59.352
Thank you, Mr. Freed. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

56:01.891 --> 56:03.324
Do you think you'll be able to play it?

56:03.426 --> 56:07.556
If I play it, I make
you famous and him rich.

56:07.664 --> 56:10.792
The question is, how bad do you want it?

56:10.900 --> 56:14.927
I'm sorry.
You said, me famous and him rich? Yeah?

56:15.372 --> 56:18.967
Well, hold on. One second. One second.

56:19.075 --> 56:21.475
Let me switch sides
with you for a moment.

56:21.578 --> 56:23.239
Chuck's a bit of a comedian.

56:24.514 --> 56:26.106
- Well, this is nice.
- Yeah.

56:26.216 --> 56:28.810
- This is very nice.
- I'm sure we can work something out.

56:28.918 --> 56:32.183
Now, some of you people
might call this race music.

56:32.288 --> 56:36.122
I call it rock and roll, and it's
too fun for anybody to sit out on,

56:36.226 --> 56:37.887
white or colored.

56:39.262 --> 56:41.560
- Did he just say what I think he said?
- Yeah.

56:41.664 --> 56:44.258
He just integrated the airwaves.

56:44.367 --> 56:48.303
- Here we are.
- Here we are, motherfucker. Here we are.

56:48.405 --> 56:51.306
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Waters, I am deeply grateful to you.

56:51.408 --> 56:52.705
You got it, baby.

57:09.192 --> 57:11.717
<i>Riding along in my automobile</i>

57:12.962 --> 57:15.487
<i>I was anxious to tell
her the way I feel</i>

57:16.433 --> 57:19.027
<i>So I told her softly and sincere</i>

57:19.135 --> 57:21.763
<i>Chuck was playing in
segregated cities.</i>

57:24.340 --> 57:29.039
<i>But there was just a thin rope</i>
<i>to separate coloreds from whites.</i>

57:29.779 --> 57:31.838
<i>And a whole lot of history.</i>

57:42.058 --> 57:45.186
<i>And that's all it took
to bring us all together,</i>

57:45.295 --> 57:48.287
<i>one man duck-walking across stage.</i>

57:48.398 --> 57:49.490
<i>Shit.</i>

57:51.234 --> 57:53.429
Please keep the aisles clear.

57:54.838 --> 57:56.135
Get back over here.

57:56.239 --> 57:58.036
Keep the aisles clear.

58:16.125 --> 58:17.683
Why don't you play like that, Daddy?

58:17.794 --> 58:21.355
- Ain't nothing but the blues sped up.
- It's rock and roll.

58:23.132 --> 58:24.759
Look at that car!

58:27.804 --> 58:29.829
Len Chess got two hot cars.

58:31.074 --> 58:33.099
Hey, Muddy. Hey, Charles.

58:33.209 --> 58:35.734
We're on <i>American Bandstand.</i>
You believe this?

58:35.845 --> 58:39.281
- There's the man. Been a long time.
- Chuck Berry!

58:39.382 --> 58:41.907
- Hey, is this the boy?
- Yeah, that's Charles.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.315
That's your car outside?

58:43.419 --> 58:44.886
The cherry-red one out there?

58:44.988 --> 58:46.956
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

58:47.056 --> 58:49.422
Ain't it? Good taste.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.654
- Sit down, Charles. Have a seat.
- Chuck Berry.

58:53.296 --> 58:55.924
Charles, Charlie, Chuck.

58:56.466 --> 58:59.435
Mortgage payment
and child support killing me.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.797
And I ain't booking the clubs enough.

59:04.874 --> 59:07.502
Len, I was talking to the accountant,

59:08.578 --> 59:10.409
and he been telling me
I'm borrowing against my royalties.

59:10.513 --> 59:13.004
Len, Mud, it's coming.
You're gonna miss it.

59:13.116 --> 59:14.242
Yeah. In a minute.

59:14.350 --> 59:17.615
What's going on?
I thought I was just getting paid.

59:21.858 --> 59:23.689
Records ain't selling.

59:24.193 --> 59:27.993
Is that how come you got
a brand-new Cadillac in the driveway?

59:28.731 --> 59:30.756
He bought me that Cadillac.

59:31.968 --> 59:34.960
Me, you and every other motherfucker

59:35.071 --> 59:38.700
cashes a Chess Records check
is riding that man's coattails.

59:38.808 --> 59:40.537
And that ain't good.

59:41.377 --> 59:42.366
Thank you.

59:42.478 --> 59:45.345
In my book, you're still number one.

59:46.049 --> 59:47.539
You, too, baby.

59:47.884 --> 59:50.079
Hey, Dad, you got to see this.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:07.960
<i>They were locking up fine black
women for sitting on buses,</i>

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:12.269
<i>stringing up our little bitty boys</i>
<i>for whistling at white women.</i>

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:16.443
<i>Not paying any mind
at all to old Chuck,</i>

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:20.642
<i>who was reaping up their firstborn</i>
<i>with this thing called rock and roll.</i>

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:35.489
<i>$3,000 in his pocket</i>
<i>and he'd be eating like a hobo.</i>

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:39.056
<i>But he'd do that before he'd give
them crackers one damn dollar.</i>

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:42.229
<i>Chuck'd rather
sleep in his own car</i>

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:45.796
<i>than to give his money</i>
<i>to one of them segregated hotels.</i>

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:55.845
<i>The man saved $100,000
the first year.</i>

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:58.750
<i>Now, he didn't drink,</i>
<i>and, no, he didn't gamble.</i>

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:01.847
<i>He only had one particular vice.</i>

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.984
- Good evening, ladies.
- You're him, aren't you?

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:08.887
Well, what "him" are you looking for?

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.192
You know.

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.561
How do you know I know?

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.104
I know everything.

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:19.368
Would you mind coming to teach me
what you know?

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.468
I'll teach you everything.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.847
<i>Now, Chuck wasn't the only one</i>
<i>looking for female talent.</i>

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:33.046
<i>Len was on a girl-hunt, too.</i>

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.321
Here she is.

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.359
Glad you could make it.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.360
I can get you a drink...

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:45.732
What, you want me to just do it
right here? Right now?

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.735
Well, I am leaving town tomorrow.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:49.998
Yeah, baby,
you don't have to be shy with him.

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:51.698
I ain't shy, fool.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:59.442
Don't be looking at me
like I ain't wearing no drawers!

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:02.484
It's just hard to do if
you ain't in the mood.

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.519
And I ain't in the mood.

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.321
She ain't in the mood.

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:13.623
Come on.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.787
I thought you said this broad was good.

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:19.095
<i>I heard</i>

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:23.997
<i>Church bells ring</i>

<i>A choir singing</i>

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:37.213

<i>Walk down the aisle</i>

<i>On her finger</i>

<i>He placed the ring</i>

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:52.327
<i>He was looking for a woman that could
go head-to-head with his men.</i>

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:55.167
<i>And he found her.</i>

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:57.637
<i>Miss Etta James.</i>

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.901
- Hey, Mud.
- You got it, baby.

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.102
When do I get you back in here?

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:04.475
You ain't heard?
My records ain't selling.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.911
You're always gonna sell, baby.

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.243
Cut.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.350
What's going on with
sweet baby girl there?

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.579
Sweet?

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:15.654
<i>Fuck you, Leonard. What the
hell you know about the blues?</i>

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:19.387
I gave you a damn good track.
You want it? You sing it.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.690
Now she want me to sing it.
Fine, go home.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.232
Forget it. Everybody go home.
That's a wrap.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.392
What are you smiling about?

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.327
My mistake.
You ain't woman enough for that song.

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.235
- I'm plenty woman.
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.638
It's about being in love.
You know what that is?

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.210
- I know about love.
- Yeah?

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.711
Motherfucker ever walk out on you?

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:42.015
Fucking not only did he walk out on you,
he's taking the other broad down the aisle.

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:44.609
You know what that feels like, baby?

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.791
Give me another one.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.799
You heard her. She wants another one.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.094
<i>Take 15.</i>

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:08.728
<i>Is ending</i>

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.173
You play a mean game of pool.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:31.817
Listen, if I brought up bad memories,
I'm sorry.

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:34.219
But it was good for the song.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.848
This album comes out,
that old boyfriend will come running.

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:39.427
I wasn't crying over no boyfriend.

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:40.654
Oh, no?

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.129
Girlfriend?

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.927
How'd you learn to play pool so good?

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.335
My daddy.

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:55.805
- Can I get a whiskey?
- Sure thing, boss.

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.276
That's good.

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.849
Hard to find time to
teach your kids things.

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:03.680
He ain't teach me shit. I taught myself.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.548
I don't want to embarrass him
when we meet.

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:09.385
Tell you who's gonna be embarrassed
is your old man.

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.824
Because he's gonna meet
a goddamn superstar.

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.121
You know?

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.827
And what is he?

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:17.660
A nobody. Now,

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.894
I don't want to embarrass you,
but let me show you how it's done.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:25.463
You're batting a thousand on being wrong.
You see that picture over there?

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:30.345
What, Minnesota Fats is your father?

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:34.774
That's the story.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.681
You ought to have him come by the studio.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:45.317
I ain't never even met that motherfucker.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:50.058
But when I do,
I want it to be in a fancy restaurant

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.930
where everybody wants my picture
and asking me for my autograph.

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:55.401
- That's the dream, huh?
- That's my dream.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:57.062
It's not a dream.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.098
You're gonna cross over.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.199
- You think?
- Promise.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:05.237
You gonna promise me
that fancy restaurant, too?

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.409
Promise.

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:12.143
The one that's gonna serve the white man
and his colored daughter.

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:16.724
Hey, come on.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.153
You sing the blues.
You don't have to live them.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.331
What the fuck do you know, white boy?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.933
Yeah, you play that hard act real good.

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:36.010
But I see you.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.281
I see you.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.563
<i>Old Len thought his checkbook</i>
<i>can fix anything,</i>

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:02.398
<i>so he bought out the
restaurant for Etta.</i>

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:05.303
<i>But there's some
things money can't fix.</i>

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:07.272
I can't help you, kid.

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.742
Gin. Can I have a bottle of gin?

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:13.511
I need a bottle of gin.

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:16.845
Gin, please. Can I have a bottle of gin?

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:21.051
Gin! Can I get a fucking bottle of gin?

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:25.325
- Come on. Bottle of gin.
- Right away, sir.

01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:28.089
I guess I got to be him to get some gin?

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:39.933
- What'd he say to you?
- Stupid shit.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:42.442
He didn't even ask if
he could see me again.

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.410
That's his problem.
Why you making it yours?

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.481
Here you go, sir.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:49.676
You wouldn't even begin to know
my problems, baby.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.346
Let me.

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.192
My mother was a whore.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:09.599
And that fat motherfucker just looked me
in my face, and he didn't see himself.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:13.870
He didn't see his little girl.
You know what he saw?

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:19.477
He saw the cum stains
of all the other men my mother fucked.

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:24.344
These chanda-fucking-liers and these
white tablecloths don't mean shit!

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.751
I ain't gonna ever be
good enough for him.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:29.221
You know they're gonna break this
when I leave, right?

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.293
Fuck it! I'll do it for you!

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:33.520
Come on, honey. Listen to me.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.727
You can't let that in.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.958
You know, Muddy,

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:43.361
he sings that hurt. He don't live it.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.566
He don't nurse it.

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:51.009
Walter, he carries it around like a baby.

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:53.308
Feeds it on whiskey and smack.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.913
You got to let it go.

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.254
I can't.

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:27.909
Oh, no.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.450
No, I'm not having it.

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:37.215
That's my song.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.922
- No, darling.
- No, no, darling.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.958
That's my song.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.829
No, darling. That's the Beach Boys.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.834
That is <i>Sweet Sixteen,</i>
note for note.

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.606
Note for note. Not one change.

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:58.578
Aside, apart from the lyrics,
about the new...

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:03.618
The new craze sweeping the nation
for young white boys and girls, surfing.

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:06.950
I've provided them the soundtrack,
unbeknownst to myself.

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.819
<i>- You ready?</i>
- Yes, I'm ready.

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:13.190
I'm very ready to make more songs
for the Beach Boys

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:17.865
and all other manner of white folks
to steal. Yes, I'm quite ready.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:20.127
- You say the devil's name, he appears.
- We need to talk.

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:24.194
Yeah, we do need to talk. You heard this?
You know what's going on?

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:26.638
- Do you know what's going on?
- I'm not laying down for this.

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:30.576
First, Alan Freed gets
a third of <i>Maybelline.</i> For what?

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:31.703
Chuck, listen.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:35.807
No. You listen to me.
Did he write one part of the song?

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.749
- One part?
- Alan Freed put us on the map.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.184
This gives him the license...

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:41.119
Did you take an underage white girl
across state lines?

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:44.624
I'm not talking about girls.
What's going on?

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:49.394
- Don't say shit. Don't say anything.
- Hello, Officers. Is there a problem?

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:52.365
Mr. Berry, you are under arrest
for transporting a minor

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:55.960
across state lines
for the purpose of prostitution.

01:12:56.071 --> 01:13:01.008
First of all, I didn't transport anyone
anywhere. I didn't solicit anything.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:05.206
Gentlemen, I'll have you know that
my very dear friend Mr. Jerry Lee Lewis

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:06.838
- has a 13-year-old wife.
- Keep your mouth shut.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.975
Are we stopping by his home on the way?
Emmett Till gets murdered

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:12.986
for whistling at a white woman.
I know you're pleased to get Chuck Berry.

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.715
Fix this, Leonard.

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:26.599
You guys got to be kidding me, man.
Where are you from?

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.727
You set that hair in the morning?

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:32.136
You ladies shouldn't be out here
without an escort.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:35.836
<i>A bunch of English boys started</i>
<i>playing our music.</i>

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:38.071
<i>Now, it was made in America,</i>

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.274
<i>but I guess nobody thought</i>
<i>we were Americans.</i>

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.977
Hey, let me help you with that, fellow.

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:47.647
Fucking hell. It's him!

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:50.554
Mr. Waters.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.286
We're big fans.

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:54.157
You're the reason we got together.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.629
We named our band
after one of your songs.

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:58.859
- Yeah?
<i>- Rolling Stone.</i>

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.570
All right.

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:05.333
Go on in there. Fuck them police.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:09.138
<i>Everybody knows the Rolling Stones,</i>
<i>the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac,</i>

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:13.146
<i>Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton.</i>
<i>Everybody know them names, right?</i>

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.147
Skinny motherfuckers.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.521
The Rolling Stones
are burning up the charts

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.853
with an old Muddy Waters standard.

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:31.961
Take 10% of Chuck's royalties
and move them to Muddy. Go on and do it.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.892
Chuck ain't gonna miss it.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:41.407
<i>The goose that laid the golden egg</i>
<i>was locked up.</i>

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:48.173
<i>So Len brought in the old standbys,</i>
<i>including Little Walter.</i>

01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:50.513
<i>Chess was desperate for a hit.</i>

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:53.986
Oh, hey, little girl, now.
Who you belong to, huh?

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:57.353
- You mind if I watch?
- Go ahead, baby girl.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.984
- I grew up on y'all's music.
- Watch?

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:01.585
Come over here.

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:04.390
I'll teach you to blow, baby.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.197
Better watch it, baby girl.
He ain't talking about that harp.

01:15:08.303 --> 01:15:10.100
Muddy, you're a fool.

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:14.171
I wouldn't mind a little bit of
what you flying on.

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:18.207
You too pretty to be flying my way, now.

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.182
You don't need that amp.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.745
- How they gonna hear me?
- Everybody's records are getting sent back.

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:28.721
You want to survive, do
something different. Play along.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:31.019
Something different? What the fuck?

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.184
What?

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:35.992
Mud, what you think about this?

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.429
What you think about this, Mud?

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.970
I think we need to lay this record.

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.440
What, I'm just a sideman now?

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.980
Okay, I'll do it, Len. I'll do it.

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:04.047
I'm broke as the rest of you
motherfuckers in here, so, you know?

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.022
I'm gonna need a bottle of gin, though.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.223
I'm gonna need a bottle of gin, baby.

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:13.495
Because I like a taste
before getting fucked.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.900
Somebody taking care of Walter?

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:19.430
That's right. Take care of me, baby.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:51.172
<i>At last</i>

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:59.146
<i>My love has come along</i>

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:07.215
<i>My lonely days are over</i>

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:15.021
<i>And life is like a song</i>

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:20.095
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:23.461
<i>At last</i>

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:31.606
<i>The skies above are blue</i>

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:40.349
<i>My heart was wrapped up in clover</i>

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:48.162
<i>The night I looked at you</i>

01:17:53.468 --> 01:17:57.302
<i>I found a dream</i>

01:17:57.706 --> 01:18:01.073
<i>That I could speak to</i>

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:05.779
<i>A dream that I</i>

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:09.112
<i>Can call my own</i>

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:13.984
<i>I found a thrill</i>

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:17.547
<i>To press my cheek to</i>

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:22.395
<i>A thrill that I</i>

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:25.057
<i>Have never known</i>

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:27.260
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.031
<i>When you smiled</i>

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.732
<i>You smiled</i>

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:38.711
<i>Oh, and then the spell was cast</i>

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:47.355
<i>And here we are in heaven</i>

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:55.460
<i>For you are mine</i>

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.499
<i>At last</i>

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:02.693
- Thanks, baby.
- You got it.

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:06.700
- Happy anniversary, Revetta.
- Thank you.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:09.504
- Where you taking her, Peppers?
- Get out of here.

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:14.674
WVJN just called.
Etta missed her airtime again.

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:18.719
God damn, it's the third time this week.
This broad, I'm gonna...

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:26.491
I'm sorry, babe. I got to go
figure out what's going on here.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.187
Don't worry about it.
I'll go look in on her.

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.661
That ain't your job, Mud.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:30.891
Chess.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.030
Go on and enjoy yourself.

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:31.123
Now, wake up, girl. Wake up.
Look here, wake up!

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:33.251
What the... What... What you...

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.295
Come here. Stand up.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:36.887
Get up, God damn it, come on.

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:39.899
- Stand up. Get up.
- Hey, baby.

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:42.697
- Come on, now.
- You came to see me?

01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:44.431
- He fucked up my hair.
- I'm going to get a doctor.

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.666
No doctors.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:49.539
Let me get Geneva then.
She knows what to do with this.

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.509
All right, that's good.

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:54.980
Wake up. Baby, come on, wake up.

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:57.278
Wake up, come on.
It's not funny. Come on.

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:02.882
This the first time I
ever used this fireplace.

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:07.353
Feel like I should be having
marshmallows or something.

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:11.125
Yeah, I'm sure marshmallows
and smack go real well together.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:15.866
What happened to the furniture?

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.496
Where's the car?

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:23.273
My mama sold what didn't get repossessed.

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:26.805
They gonna take my house.

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:28.439
Oh, that's good.

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.349
Come on.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.956
You got to put it in my name.

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:45.559
You hear me? You gonna trust me?
Put the house in my name.

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:48.761
What? What?

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.135
Trust me.

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.604
<i>Trust in me</i>

01:21:57.812 --> 01:22:01.179
<i>In all you do</i>

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.443
Listen.

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:07.319
Listen to me. I'm gonna get you
in a clinic and get some help.

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.588
I'm gonna pay for it.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.589
It's not a loan. It's a gift.

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:16.425
So, now you buying me gifts?

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.431
Yeah, that's right.

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.797
I must be real special.

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:26.536
I must make you a lot of money.

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.266
Yeah, that must be it.

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:30.867
I ain't stupid.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:36.076
I'm your number-one bitch
since Chuck got busted.

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:39.620
- I'm trying to take care of you.
- You gonna take care of me?

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:44.090
Who the fuck you think you talking to,
your tight-ass wife?

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.959
That's off-limits.

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:49.724
I don't need no man to take care of me.

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:53.767
So tough. You look so fucking good.
With these track marks in your arm?

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:57.395
That's real good. Well, that's good.
Yeah, that'll fix your problems, huh?

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.632
Baby, don't worry.

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:03.000
Etta ain't gonna hurt you.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:09.781
That feels nice. It feel real good.
Who bought you that?

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:14.685
Did Etta buy you that? I think she did.
Who bought you that car?

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:18.390
I think I got that
nice car out there, too.

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:21.860
Don't worry.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:25.855
- I'll do it for you, baby.
- Come on. Stop that.

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:30.028
Just say, "Trust in me,"
like all them other motherfuckers...

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:33.198
Come on, I ain't taking from you!
I'm offering.

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:38.245
God damn it, I don't know what the fuck
to say to you. I'm not your fucking pimp.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.314
- That's not us.
- "Us"?

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.548
What the fuck is "us"?

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.252
A white man and a black girl?

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:52.391
I been there.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.556
Yeah, but you ain't been here.

01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:01.830
I'm not your father.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:07.965
And you ain't your mother.

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:13.471
And I ain't gonna hurt you.

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.542
I got no reason to hurt you.

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:23.755
You don't even know what you have.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.360
What do I have?

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:33.228
You got a hit record.

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:35.559
What?

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:38.104
You're on top of the charts, baby.

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:40.899
You crossed over.

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:43.071
Len, I crossed over?

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:44.810
I told you.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.422
Geneva a nurse.

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:09.234
Hello, Etta.

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:10.571
Hi.

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:21.615
Are you sure you want Geneva to stay here
or you want her to come home with me?

01:25:24.219 --> 01:25:26.084
It's not what you think.

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:29.480
Oh, this is just business?

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:33.285
- That's right.
- You never hold me like that.

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:35.794
Cross over and I'll
jump into bed with you.

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:39.060
I bet you'd jump out
that motherfucker quick, too.

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:48.535
What?

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.205
What?

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:55.572
You know how Walter call you
his white daddy,

01:25:55.683 --> 01:26:00.052
because every time he step in shit,
you there to get him out of trouble?

01:26:00.688 --> 01:26:04.317
And then you bring him in the studio
and you take away his amp,

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:06.859
the sound that took him
his whole life to make up.

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:11.421
Any other motherfucker he'd have shot
for that, but he give it up for you.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.395
What you telling that little girl
ain't got nobody in the world?

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.870
That you're gonna take care of her?

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:20.565
How many strung-out
girls you told that to?

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:24.668
I ain't talking about me. I'm talking
about you and the baby girl in there.

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:28.215
- What if I told you I had feelings for her?
- Bullshit.

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.351
Fine.

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:37.288
I'm fucking her, I'm fucking Chuck,
and I'm fucking you. Huh?

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:40.118
That's what you think, huh?

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:42.926
Ain't that what you think, Mud?

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:49.202
Well, that's what the blues is, ain't it?
A whole lot of fucking.

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.897
Tell Geneva I'm gone.

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:02.748
<i>They locked Chuck up</i>
<i>at the peak of his career.</i>

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:05.148
<i>He couldn't record a damn thing.</i>

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:07.483
- Goodbye.
- Mr. Berry! Mr. Berry!

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:20.631
- Yeah?
<i>- Somebody busted up your store.</i>

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:23.127
What? Somebody broke in?

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.763
<i>You better come and see about it.</i>

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:27.864
Yeah, I'll be right down.

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:30.141
Who is this?

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:34.140
<i>Len's world was changing.</i>

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:39.186
<i>Not only was Muddy questioning him,</i>
<i>but so were the folks in the neighborhood.</i>

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:43.417
<i>Colored folks who were told</i>
<i>they weren't colored no more, but black,</i>

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:46.593
<i>who was told they had a power.</i>

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:50.027
<i>They had the right to own</i>
<i>their own businesses.</i>

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:52.725
<i>And who was this white man</i>
<i>getting rich off of them?</i>

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.461
You want to fuck around back here?

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.197
<i>The south side of
Chicago was getting mad.</i>

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:59.239
<i>Everybody could feel
the change coming.</i>

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.604
Get on out of our neighborhood!

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:07.907
<i>Screaming fans went nuts again</i>
<i>for rock and roll star Elvis Presley.</i>

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:13.113
<i>Presley, handsome as ever,</i>
<i>tipped his hat for the cameras.</i>

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:16.190
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:18.017
your new king.

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.560
I'm about to win this money, baby.

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:23.421
Tough luck, boy.

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:25.260
- Tough luck?
- You lose.

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:27.266
Back up, motherfucker.

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:30.462
No tough luck got this, motherfucker.

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:34.702
Because this shit here
says my luck is just fine.

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.606
What you gonna do, blow me to death?

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:37.803
Shit.

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:43.317
Walter.

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:45.477
Okay. Oh, Jesus. Walter!

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:48.849
Oh, God.

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:53.287
You ain't come and get me, Mama.
You didn't come and get me.

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:58.363
I've been waiting for
you for a long time.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:00.664
I'm here.

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:02.667
I found you.

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:06.132
Mama loves you. Come on, stay with me.

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:09.439
- I just got to rest my eyes.
- Stay with me.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.305
I just got to rest my eyes.

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:14.210
No. No, stay with me.

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.454
Wait a minute.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.634
Wait a minute.

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:43.803
<i>Last night</i>

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:48.544
<i>I lost the best friend I ever had</i>

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:57.115
<i>Now you've gone and left me</i>

01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:01.750
<i>That make me feel so bad</i>

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:03.660
All right. All right.

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:06.329
All right.

01:30:08.636 --> 01:30:09.603
All right.

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:15.842
Thank you. Thank you.

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:27.785
All right.

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:31.748
Well, we'll have to see if we can...

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:36.424
If we can't get him a new suit.

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:45.501
Get him one of them boxes
with the blue satin lining inside.

01:30:47.308 --> 01:30:49.208
Have him look slick.

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.278
I got to use the toilet.

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:21.268
- Can I get you some tea?
- No, thank you.

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:26.179
You know, there's a whole line
of bluesmen on your lawn,

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.407
waiting to see if you're dead.

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:30.006
Looking to see if they owe me money.

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:31.175
Yeah.

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:35.581
Look at that. You're the
first man ever gave me flowers.

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:38.818
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, don't tell nobody.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:41.827
They're beautiful.
I'll put them in a vase.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:43.759
You okay?

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:45.594
I'm good. Thank you.

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:48.365
- Mud.
- Wolf.

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:52.497
Shit.

01:31:57.311 --> 01:32:00.678
I know Walter was into you for a whole lot,
but he got anything coming his way?

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:03.978
- You know how he spent his money.
- Yeah, I know it.

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.452
Look here.

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:12.816
I got $200 to my name.

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:17.354
You're gonna have to help pay
for Walter's funeral.

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:18.489
Who said I wouldn't?

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:21.762
Why he got to pay for Walter's funeral?
He ain't Walter's daddy.

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:25.066
Is you and me talking? Walter put a lot of
goddamn money in his billfold, that's why.

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:27.800
- I'm the only motherfucker making money?
- Looks like it.

01:32:27.909 --> 01:32:31.037
That's the man's job, make money
off of you. You from Mississippi.

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:34.478
- You ought to know that.
- How many Caddies did y'all go through?

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:37.073
Let's get this straight.
I didn't fuck you.

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:38.811
I didn't say nothing
about who fucked who.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.548
You insinuated that with your bullshit!

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:44.124
You was out with the fucking jewelry
and the broads all the time.

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:46.625
And you was a motherfucking saint?

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.094
Who here is a saint?

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.128
Who here?

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:56.866
- Settle down.
- No, Revetta, please.

01:32:56.971 --> 01:33:00.771
If you act like a boy, keep asking for
handouts, he gonna treat you like one.

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:03.036
Is you and me talking, motherfucker?
What is you looking for?

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:06.409
I'm looking to help
bury a fellow musician.

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:08.379
I said I'll pay for it!

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.453
Now, it feels good not to have a daddy.

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:20.215
And as much as I don't like you,
I want you to feel good

01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:23.086
like that, too.

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.081
I killed Walter.

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:56.997
I killed him
when I let you take away his amp.

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.164
I'm the motherfucker?

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:07.001
I'm the motherfucker?

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:10.199
<i>It was over,</i>

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:13.068
<i>the music, Chess Records.</i>

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:15.636
<i>Everybody could feel it.</i>

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:19.078
<i>Len was getting
out while he could.</i>

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:24.845
So, working on something
behind my back now, huh?

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:29.819
What happened to <i>"Trust In Me"?</i>

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:33.152
I know what you've been doing.

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.922
- Yeah, what?
- You gonna sell the company.

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:45.528
You know, back when I started this,

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:50.576
nobody'd let a black man do
what I got done.

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.373
Doors weren't open.

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.515
Now they are.

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:59.076
Time to move on.

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:01.154
You gonna be missing out.

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.949
You don't think I know that?

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:11.122
So, you mean to tell me, this could be
the last time I sing a song for you?

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:20.068
Better make it good.

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:22.509
They don't get no better.

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:24.943
Y'all ready?

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:49.927
<i>Something told me</i>

01:36:50.037 --> 01:36:53.063
<i>It was over</i>

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:59.209
<i>When I saw you and her</i>

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:01.281
<i>Talking</i>

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:06.575
<i>Something deep down</i>

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:10.555
<i>In my soul said, "Cry, girl"</i>

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:13.149
<i>- Cry, girl</i>
<i>- Cry, girl</i>

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:16.661
<i>When I saw you and that girl</i>

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:18.994
<i>Walking around</i>

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:26.697
<i>I would rather,
I would rather go blind, boy</i>

01:37:30.377 --> 01:37:35.838
<i>Than to see you walk away from me</i>
<i>Child, no</i>

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:42.713
<i>So you see, I love you so much</i>

01:37:42.823 --> 01:37:46.384
<i>That I don't want to watch you</i>
<i>leave me, baby</i>

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.027
<i>Most of all, I just don't</i>

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:53.622
<i>I just don't want to be free, no</i>

01:37:57.104 --> 01:38:00.403
<i>I was just, I was just</i>

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:03.305
<i>I was just sitting here thinking</i>

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:06.478
<i>Of your kiss</i>

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:10.710
<i>And your warm embrace, yeah</i>

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:16.281
<i>When the reflection in a glass</i>

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:20.053
<i>That I held to my lips now, baby</i>

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:23.990
<i>Revealed these tears</i>

01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:27.499
<i>That are on my face</i>

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:32.797
<i>And, baby</i>

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:38.368
<i>And, baby, baby,
I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:42.208
<i>Than to see you walk away</i>

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:45.649
<i>Walk away from me, yeah</i>

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:51.352
<i>And, baby, baby, baby</i>

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:55.121
<i>I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:59.157
<i>Than to see you walk away</i>

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:01.359
<i>Walk away from me</i>

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:09.607
<i>And, baby, baby, baby</i>

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:12.611
<i>I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:16.573
<i>Than to see you walk away</i>

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:20.677
<i>Walk away from me, yeah</i>

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:45.444
<i>Chess Records had a hold on Len.</i>

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:48.444
<i>It just wouldn't let him leave.</i>

01:39:49.216 --> 01:39:52.617
<i>He had a heart attack</i>
<i>before he could turn the corner.</i>

01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:01.888
Baby girl, I got some bad news for you.

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:06.058
Chess ain't leave no will.

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:10.227
That means everything that belonged
to him goes to the wife and children,

01:40:10.337 --> 01:40:12.328
including this here house.

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:14.865
That's all right.

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:19.111
This morning,
a man came by and gave me this.

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:22.039
What's that?

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:24.515
It's the deed to my house.

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:27.712
He said Len wanted me to have it
in case something ever happened.

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.482
That motherfucker.

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:34.687
He didn't have time to leave a will,
but he had time to think of me?

01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:38.629
He loved me.

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:40.960
That motherfucker.

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:51.768
What do you say, Willie?

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:53.710
What do you say, there? How you doing?

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.372
I'm here. How you doing?

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:58.645
Oh, I can't complain. Got some good news.

01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:01.050
Remember some of them English boys?

01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:04.022
They didn't forget about us.
Been telling all Europe about us.

01:41:04.124 --> 01:41:06.524
Want us to come over there and play.

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:08.458
I ain't got no money to get on no plane
to no England.

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:12.123
You don't need no money.
They're gonna pay for everything.

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:16.896
You're serious?

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:18.904
We're going to England.

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:27.441
I'm a little bit...

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:30.040
A little bit nervous here.

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:33.176
Nervous? What you nervous about?

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:35.414
You've been performing your whole life.

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:38.685
Yeah, but not...
Not for these folks over here.

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:44.524
How am I supposed to know
what they want?

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:45.893
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:48.661
<i>We are now beginning our descent</i>
<i>into Heathrow Airport.</i>

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:50.100
Here we go.

01:41:57.711 --> 01:42:01.147
Welcome to London.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:04.480
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:18.561
- A pleasure to see you, Mr. Waters.
- Mr. Waters!

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:28.933
They want you, Mr. Waters. They want you.

01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:32.170
<i>We sued Chess Records
for back royalties.</i>

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:34.110
<i>And we did all right.</i>

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.205
<i>Well, especially me.</i>

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:40.776
<i>Because I wrote all those songs</i>
<i>that Muddy, Walter and Wolf were singing.</i>

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:43.046
<i>I got paid.</i>

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.182
<i>And I'm still getting paid.</i>

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:48.261
<i>I made enough money</i>
<i>to buy this here studio.</i>

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:51.297
<i>They were going to tear it down,</i>
<i>but I knew it was history.</i>

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:54.526
<i>I'm a man</i>
<i>Don't matter if you got the upper hand</i>

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:59.127
<i>We made the kind of music</i>
<i>that can grow into anything,</i>

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:02.766
<i>rhythm and blues,
rock and roll, hip hop.</i>

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:06.573
<i>Whatever you're playing, baby,</i>
<i>we're right there with you.</i>

01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:12.910
<i>Just sprinkle a little blues on it</i>
<i>and it's gonna grow up to be big and bad.</i>

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.884
<i>We the hoochie coochie seed.</i>
