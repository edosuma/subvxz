WEBVTT

00:09.218 --> 00:10.302
Watch your step.

00:19.478 --> 00:20.562
What happened?

00:20.646 --> 00:23.857
Oh, the lady died in there.One of the officers said suicide.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.579
Suicide my ass.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.539
I think she killed her mother.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.834
You should've seenthat self-satisfied look she gave me.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.711
Yeah, well,this is Erin's preliminary tox report.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.214
Fentanyl.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.300
And ODs like thisusually show high levels of it.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.843
People popping a lot of pills.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.179
And this one seems likeit was a perfectly measured dose.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.891
Which someone who works inthe death business would know how to do.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.351
Like your friend Lanie.

02:23.769 --> 02:27.356
Same woman who broke into my houselooking for her diary.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.192
Took my mother's church fanand gave it to her kid to play with.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.945
Yeah, but Erin hasa long history of pill popping.

02:33.028 --> 02:37.115
And she's been locked up a bunch of times,so an OD makes sense to the cops.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.617
This case is done.

02:40.410 --> 02:45.165
But Erin was gonna come on the podcastand tell me what happened that night.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.291
Really?

02:46.375 --> 02:50.712
All right, so Lanie makes it seemlike Erin is freaking out

02:50.796 --> 02:53.799
because you're about to dredge upa whole bunch of shit.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.843
So, what does she do?

02:55.926 --> 02:58.804
She pops some pills to take the edge offand she winds up OD'ing.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.806
And the only reason Lanie would do that

03:00.889 --> 03:03.809
is if she killed her fatherand needed her mother to be quiet.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.645
Yeah, I can see that.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.066
You agree with me for once. Finally.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.526
I agree with you on this one.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.611
You've come to see my brilliance.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.738
I wouldn't say all that.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.576
-Hello?-<i>Hello.</i>

03:20.659 --> 03:23.161
<i>This is a prepaid collect call from...</i>

03:23.245 --> 03:24.580
<i>California State Penitentiary.</i>

03:24.663 --> 03:26.456
<i>To accept charges--</i>

03:27.791 --> 03:28.792
<i>I don't have long.</i>

03:28.876 --> 03:31.420
-<i>The guards released me back into gen pop.</i>-Oh, shit.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.839
<i>I'll be luckyif I make it to the end of day.</i>

03:34.256 --> 03:37.885
Well, can we get your lawyerto request protective custody?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.219
<i>No, it's too late.</i>

03:39.678 --> 03:42.806
Listen, if I die before my mother does,

03:42.890 --> 03:45.434
you have to promise methat you keep this from her.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.644
<i>Don't talk like that.I'm gonna get you out.</i>

03:47.728 --> 03:50.981
You camp at her house,you steal her phone if you--

03:51.064 --> 03:52.608
-I'm calling the warden.-Poppy.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.652
This one's for Kuvney.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.072
-<i>Warren. Warren.</i>-Piece of shit!

03:59.156 --> 04:00.490
Warren.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.498
She called me,

04:09.208 --> 04:12.503
slurring her words,ranting about Poppy Parnell.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.339
So I went over thereto try to calm her down,

04:15.422 --> 04:17.798
but by the time I got thereshe was already...

04:19.843 --> 04:21.345
Still doesn't make any sense.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.806
But how could we knowwhat was going on in Mom's head?

04:25.224 --> 04:26.767
She barely even knew herself.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.853
No way. You don't understand.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.814
We were gonna start over.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.067
Both of us, here, together.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.945
Why were you there?

04:38.487 --> 04:39.530
What do you mean?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.865
Why did she call you and not me?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.369
She'd never made herself vulnerablelike that to you.

04:47.538 --> 04:48.705
I don't know.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.584
Maybe she was scared, you know,

04:52.668 --> 04:55.254
that she couldn't live up to everythingthat she promised you.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.840
Do you really think that?

05:00.551 --> 05:01.552
Oh, my God.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.178
Josie, I didn't mean it--

05:06.306 --> 05:07.808
<i>Don't tell Mom, okay?</i>

05:14.147 --> 05:15.732
Hey, are you okay?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.901
Josie, are you okay?

05:21.572 --> 05:23.323
Get back to me by end of day.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.743
I need your help.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.288
-With?-Lanie Buhrman.

05:29.371 --> 05:34.042
She was institutionalized and I thinkher time inside holds some of the answers.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.378
Crapped out on that onewith my colleague's wife.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.214
I don't need her medical records,just the name of her doctor.

05:39.298 --> 05:43.552
When I saw you coming in, I thought,"Finally. She's here to talk about us."

05:44.595 --> 05:47.556
-What do you need from me?-The truth which I haven't been getting.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.516
-About?-Come on, Poppy.

05:50.726 --> 05:54.646
You know,Warren and I couldn't be further apart.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.649
But somehow I felt like we were linked.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.568
My destiny with his.

06:00.652 --> 06:04.114
It made me want to fight for himthe way I would fight for myself.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.659
The way I couldn't fightfor myself as a kid.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.958
When you were a kid.

06:16.835 --> 06:21.381
Well, I got some information aboutyour foster mother, Shirley Maxwell.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.013
It said that she drownedwhile you were in her care.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.389
I don't like to talk about it.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.308
Just trying to understand.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.644
She drowned in front of mewhen I was nine.

06:34.770 --> 06:38.315
Just a little under a yearafter my mother died.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.819
Now, I really don't like to think aboutanything from that time.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.992
I couldn't help my mother.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.871
I couldn't help Shirley.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.541
And that's why you've beenso crazed about this case.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.335
Warren is out of time.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.295
And so am I.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.258
I really need your help with Lanie.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.262
I'll see what I can do.

07:09.847 --> 07:10.848
Thank you.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.017
But there's a price.

07:14.852 --> 07:18.230
I got an offer to go backand head up my father's firm in New York.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.356
What? Ingram--

07:19.439 --> 07:24.152
Poppy, I'm helping you on this oneso you can be done with this case,

07:24.236 --> 07:28.198
so you can get back to whatyou used to do, to how we used to be.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.203
That is how we get us back.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.416
You're going down, Warren!

07:41.003 --> 07:42.296
You're a dead man, Cave.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.714
Better watch your back.

07:44.506 --> 07:48.093
Imma watch you spit up, bro.Imma bleed you.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.180
Sleep tight, princess.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.890
You're fucking dead.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.726
I'm gonna fuck you up, Cave.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.812
I'm gonna get you.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.488
What have you got?

08:08.906 --> 08:12.618
Happy times,except it's missing one thing: Lanie.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.829
You see less and less of her in theseas the girls get older.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.248
There's plenty of Erin and Josie.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.791
Chuck and Josie.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.752
<i>Does it take a picture?Why are you just holding it?</i>

08:21.835 --> 08:23.754
<i>I don't know. I have to...It's still videoing.</i>

08:23.837 --> 08:25.422
She's become an outsider.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.009
Hold that thought.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.261
Hey, babe, any luck?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.181
<i>Insurance company worked.</i>

08:34.264 --> 08:37.183
<i>Lanie's doctor still works at Redwood.Ian Poole.</i>

08:37.267 --> 08:38.434
Yes.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.561
Thanks so much for this.

08:39.977 --> 08:43.106
Think about moving back to New York.Really think about it.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.734
We'll discuss it later. I promise.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.069
Are you kidding me?

08:47.152 --> 08:50.739
For now, can we just stay focusedon Lanie Buhrman?

08:51.740 --> 08:52.741
Okay.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.035
What next then?

09:34.199 --> 09:36.326
Josie, I'm sorry about your mom.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.580
Are you? Really?

09:40.706 --> 09:42.749
I lost my mother when I was nine.

09:44.126 --> 09:48.463
And I still think about her every day.And it still breaks my heart.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.008
My mom died of an overdose

09:51.091 --> 09:54.928
right around the time you were convincingthe world that she might be a murderer.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.639
What could be better for your podcast?

09:57.723 --> 09:59.016
Finding out the truth.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.145
I was going to see your motherwhen she died.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.396
Why?

10:05.397 --> 10:06.940
She was going to talk.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.526
When I arrived at your aunt Susan's,

10:09.610 --> 10:12.654
the paramedics were there and your sister.

10:13.447 --> 10:18.619
Your mother was on a rehab drugcalled Antabuse the night of the murder.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.330
She wasn't passed out drunkat the party, Josie,

10:21.413 --> 10:23.332
she wasn't even drinking that night.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.170
But you knew that, didn't you?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.340
She never got the chanceto tell me what she knew.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.635
-And I don't think it was an accident.-No.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.220
Your sister's the one who found the body.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.514
Your sister's the oneyour mother supposedly called.

10:38.597 --> 10:39.598
Stop.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.768
The level of drugs in her systemdoesn't fit your usual suicide.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.229
-It was calibrated perfectly to be---We're done.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.189
I think Lanie killed your father.

10:48.941 --> 10:52.528
And when she found out your mother wasgoing to come clean, she killed her too.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.658
You're the only one left, Josie.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.537
Seventeen years,you cut yourself off from her.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.167
Changed your name,made sure she couldn't reach you.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.211
Just let go.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.379
<i>What are you doing? Lanie...</i>

11:10.462 --> 11:14.299
If there is even a tiny part of youthat believes any of this could be true,

11:14.383 --> 11:15.801
then you've got to help me.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.347
What do you want me to do?

11:28.564 --> 11:30.023
-Can I help you?-Yes.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.985
I am here to pick up my juvenile records.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.279
The release was authorized by Dr. Poole.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.865
-And your name?-Lanie Buhrman.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.286
Dr. Poole.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.621
It's good to see you looking so well.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.456
How have you been?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.250
I've been great.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.628
I'm married.I have a four-year-old daughter.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.589
I understand you need your records?

11:53.672 --> 11:55.632
Yes. I'm applying for a job.

11:56.175 --> 11:57.259
Children services.

11:57.342 --> 12:01.180
So, naturally, they need to seeevery stitch of paper on me

12:01.263 --> 12:03.557
including records from my time here.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.892
Good for you.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.351
Michael can help you.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.396
I am thrilled to see you happy, Lanie.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.107
Thank you.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.447
Lanie, we need to talk.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.992
Sure, I'm just finishingMr. Carr's death certificate.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.244
Rosemary can finish that.

12:26.580 --> 12:31.960
So, a few troubling revelations have cometo light over the past few weeks.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.087
What revelations?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.840
Inappropriate behavior.

12:37.925 --> 12:42.012
An inappropriate sexual relationshipbetween you and Virginia Reed's grandson.

12:45.224 --> 12:48.644
This podcast about your familyhas people talking.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.230
Your profile has gone up. He talked.

12:51.313 --> 12:54.733
He told several people,and his father reported it to us.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.693
It's not like he was a kid.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.530
I'm afraid that I have tolet you go immediately.

13:00.239 --> 13:02.115
No. No!

13:02.199 --> 13:03.242
I need your key.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.624
Here, take your fucking key.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.515
What does it say?

13:26.598 --> 13:30.352
Signs of histrionic personality disorder.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.021
Overwhelming desire to be noticed.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.941
Psychosis.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.406
"At the same time, the patient displays

13:42.489 --> 13:46.034
an unhealthy obsession with twin sister,Josephine Buhrman.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.203
Borders on pathological.

13:48.287 --> 13:52.583
Often cannot distinguish her own actionsand those of her sibling.

13:52.666 --> 13:57.337
Described being separated from her twinas 'acute physical pain.'"

14:01.717 --> 14:02.718
What?

14:04.636 --> 14:06.388
Josie, what else does it say?

14:08.098 --> 14:12.269
They think that she was lyingabout my dad sexually abusing her.

14:14.980 --> 14:20.027
"The real goal of the accusationwas to sever the close emotional ties

14:20.110 --> 14:23.071
between father and twin sister,Josephine."

14:25.365 --> 14:26.742
Go away, Josie.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.213
Is there anything from that nightthat you can remember?

14:42.466 --> 14:45.135
Just these flashes.None of it makes sense.

14:45.219 --> 14:48.222
My dad's face, flapping wings, blood.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.350
I'd like to show you something.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.107
What's going on?

14:59.191 --> 15:01.235
I'm taking Ella up to Tahoe.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.987
Since when?

15:04.071 --> 15:07.824
Since the cops came to my workasking about your behavior with clients.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.161
Oh, my God. My bitch boss.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.163
They mentioned missing drugs from clients.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.706
What?

15:15.624 --> 15:18.335
Jesus Christ, Alex. I don't even--

15:19.211 --> 15:22.506
My mom literally just died.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.882
I mean, can I--

15:23.966 --> 15:25.592
-Jesus.-What are you doing?

15:27.094 --> 15:28.554
Alex! Stop!

15:29.513 --> 15:31.223
Your patient's pills.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.141
Obviously, I can explain that.

15:33.559 --> 15:36.770
I'd like to see you try.'Cause I couldn't.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.693
Did you do it?

15:44.444 --> 15:47.614
No, I never slept with any client.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.658
What? And honestly, you have no idea--

15:49.741 --> 15:51.493
I'm not talking about your goddamn client!

15:53.120 --> 15:54.621
What are you talking about then?

15:57.332 --> 16:01.003
I made a habit out of not askingany questions this entire marriage.

16:02.588 --> 16:03.797
Why would I start now?

16:07.301 --> 16:09.011
Are you coming back?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.097
Are you bringing Ella back?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.481
You're really getting rid of these, huh?

16:23.108 --> 16:24.151
Yeah.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.907
I remember when I put these things on youback in the day.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.577
Thought to myself,"This boy ain't got no clue...

16:34.870 --> 16:36.622
what he's inking up for."

16:36.705 --> 16:40.417
Oh, I knew.Which is why I'm here right now.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.671
Done.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.466
You're good to go.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.136
Thanks.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.390
Removing those...

16:56.975 --> 16:58.936
You know that means death, right?

17:00.437 --> 17:03.023
I am already dead.

17:03.524 --> 17:07.277
Not the waythey're gonna serve it to you for that.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.200
My body is already gone.

17:14.284 --> 17:17.412
Maybe this is the only wayI can save my soul.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.706
I remember everything about that day.

18:02.541 --> 18:03.792
Everything.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.086
But that night...

18:07.462 --> 18:09.923
Warren's life is in danger as we speak.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.720
He went to prison because of Lanie,but he could die because of you.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.807
I have a video from that night.Can I play it for you?

18:27.524 --> 18:28.525
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

18:28.609 --> 18:30.277
I remember those costumes.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.363
We were obsessed with Anne Boleyn.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.491
<i>That's disgusting. Off with your head.</i>

18:40.078 --> 18:43.874
There's something I wanted to ask youabout that night.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.255
You see those statues thereon the hall table? The pheasants?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.430
<i>Go away, Josie.</i>

19:14.905 --> 19:15.989
Don't tell Mom, okay?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.502
One of them went missingthe night of the murder.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.546
We think it could be the murder weapon.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.800
Do you know where it is?

19:38.595 --> 19:39.805
I think so.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.823
Don't worry about him. He's harmless.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.826
That's your problem, boy.

20:01.326 --> 20:05.539
The people that thrive in heretend to be very harmful.

20:12.087 --> 20:16.133
Look, I'm sureyou've heard about my situation.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.972
I need help.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.183
I know you don't like the guyscoming after me,

20:24.266 --> 20:26.810
so I thought it could be a win-win.

20:28.145 --> 20:29.897
So this would be good for me?

20:30.397 --> 20:31.815
All I can say is...

20:32.900 --> 20:35.360
I will do whatever it takesto get protection from you.

20:35.777 --> 20:39.281
Right? Drugs, cell phones, cigarettes.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.407
You wanna live?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.453
I don't dislike you,

20:45.162 --> 20:47.372
because I dislike your people a lot more.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.541
Raines, it's not...

20:50.584 --> 20:52.211
They aren't my people anymore.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.257
So one black girl helps you see the light

20:57.341 --> 20:59.426
and suddenly the rest of us areall supposed to give a shit?

20:59.510 --> 21:03.764
Listen, I am out of options here.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.642
Still, shit's been quiet around here.

21:07.684 --> 21:11.647
Protecting you means going to war,maybe losing one of these assholes.

21:12.064 --> 21:13.357
For you?

21:15.400 --> 21:16.485
Can't make it work.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.993
Oh, my God.

22:20.257 --> 22:23.093
-Why did you write these things about Dad?-Because they're true.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.724
I know that you worship him, but he's...

22:36.732 --> 22:37.733
Josie.

22:40.194 --> 22:41.236
Josie.

22:44.907 --> 22:45.991
I don't want to.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.160
-This is not about what you want.-Dad, stop.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.204
Do what I say. Come on.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.253
-Get in there!-Dad, stop!

22:58.337 --> 22:59.963
-Step in my office now.-Dad, let me go!

23:00.047 --> 23:01.465
Stop! Let me go!

23:02.633 --> 23:03.634
Let her go!

23:04.843 --> 23:05.844
Josie...

23:18.065 --> 23:20.275
Josie, no. Josie, stop.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.501
-Oh, my God.-What is it, Josie?

23:39.086 --> 23:42.172
It... It was me.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.678
It was me.

23:59.106 --> 24:01.733
Well, you huffed and you puffedand you blew the house down.

24:01.817 --> 24:03.151
For what? For nothing.

24:03.235 --> 24:04.695
Warren will go free.

24:04.778 --> 24:08.615
Yeah, and sweet, innocent,good twin Josie'll take his place.

24:08.949 --> 24:12.578
Imagine what's gonna happen to herin there because of you.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.372
All because you couldn't mindyour own goddamn business.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.666
If I had to go, it might be okay.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.669
But Josie? She's gonna get eaten alive.

24:21.128 --> 24:23.755
She's the weak twin. There's always one.

24:23.839 --> 24:26.008
And you get away with all your lies.

24:26.091 --> 24:28.719
You lied about your father abusing you.You lied about Warren.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.304
I was protecting my sister.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.722
Say it was you.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.015
You're out of your mind.

24:33.098 --> 24:36.476
Accept the blame or Josie's gonnapay the price for what you did.

24:37.019 --> 24:39.897
Look, your doctor said it.You love her too much.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.983
So prove it. Protect her.

24:44.735 --> 24:47.446
You're right. That is my problem.

24:47.529 --> 24:51.074
I've always loved hermore than she loves me.

24:52.492 --> 24:57.122
I realize that now,and I have to stop putting her first.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.839
So, you're the onewith the decision to make, Poppy.

25:06.924 --> 25:08.300
It all depends on you.

25:18.477 --> 25:22.105
You've been white-hot since day oneto prove Warren innocent.

25:22.189 --> 25:24.608
His father's dead... in your house.

25:24.691 --> 25:28.278
The bar got raided, Cydie got arrested,Ingram is sleeping in your guest room.

25:28.362 --> 25:30.322
Why are you takingyour foot off the gas now?

25:30.405 --> 25:33.784
Josie is a victim too, just like Warren,because of her sister.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.577
She won't make it in jail, Des.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.205
Your job is done.You did this to find the truth--

25:38.288 --> 25:39.498
I did this...

25:41.667 --> 25:43.961
to be able to put my headon my pillow at night.

25:45.504 --> 25:49.633
Since I was nine, Mama diedand I went to live with Miss Shirley...

25:50.634 --> 25:52.219
that's all I have ever wanted,

25:52.302 --> 25:56.014
was to be able to put my head on my pillowat night and rest easy.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.810
Warren brought back the unrest.

25:59.893 --> 26:03.605
And it will be the same thingall over again if I send Josie to prison.

26:08.485 --> 26:11.488
I know you're hurting. I can see it.

26:12.114 --> 26:15.826
But you are the only onewho can decide what to do.

26:17.995 --> 26:19.454
And whatever that is...

26:20.831 --> 26:22.207
you better be certain.

27:07.711 --> 27:08.795
When I was growing up,

27:08.879 --> 27:13.300
my mother had a framed quoteon our kitchen counter.

27:13.759 --> 27:15.969
<i>I took it with me when I left home.</i>

27:16.845 --> 27:21.183
<i>Subconsciously, it might have playeda role in my becoming a journalist.</i>

27:21.266 --> 27:25.479
"I am for truth, no matter who tells it.

27:25.938 --> 27:30.776
I'm for justice,no matter who it's for or against."

27:32.110 --> 27:33.362
Malcolm X.

27:35.405 --> 27:38.116
Problem is brother Malcolm never saidwhat you're supposed to do

27:38.200 --> 27:41.537
when truth and justice don't line up.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.372
<i>For a moment, imagine this:</i>

27:43.455 --> 27:47.918
<i>You toss a pebble withoutmuch thought or care into the ocean.</i>

27:48.335 --> 27:52.506
<i>You move on as the ripple effectfrom that tossed stone</i>

27:52.923 --> 27:56.385
<i>creates a tidal wave on another shore.</i>

27:56.802 --> 28:00.097
<i>This podcast was that wave.</i>

28:00.556 --> 28:05.519
<i>And it was feltin every corner of every life it touched.</i>

28:06.562 --> 28:08.897
<i>It upended... no...</i>

28:09.439 --> 28:13.652
<i>I upended everythingin the pursuit of justice.</i>

28:14.194 --> 28:18.991
<i>"Justice." A word more fluidthan I ever realized.</i>

28:19.074 --> 28:21.243
<i>I did what I had to do.</i>

28:21.702 --> 28:23.412
<i>And now I have to pay the price.</i>

28:23.495 --> 28:28.959
<i>Justice has meant something differentfor everyone involved with this case.</i>

28:29.042 --> 28:31.003
Don't let my mother die alone.

28:31.086 --> 28:34.882
<i>That was true in 1999 and it's true now.</i>

28:37.009 --> 28:41.263
<i>I set forth at the beginningof this series to find answers.</i>

28:41.346 --> 28:42.764
<i>I succeeded.</i>

28:42.848 --> 28:47.895
<i>But at what cost?To the Buhrmans, to the Caves, to myself.</i>

28:50.564 --> 28:53.859
<i>How far would I go to right a wrong?</i>

28:53.942 --> 28:55.777
<i>What would I be willing to lose?</i>

28:55.861 --> 29:01.408
<i>And who am Iif I don't risk it all to make amends?</i>

29:02.784 --> 29:06.246
Friday, May 10th, 4:06 p.m.,Menlo Police Department.

29:06.663 --> 29:09.541
This is the recorded statementof Josephine Buhrman.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.418
Josie.

29:13.212 --> 29:14.838
Could you repeat that louder?

29:14.922 --> 29:16.256
Who killed your father?

29:19.676 --> 29:20.761
My mother.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.139
Your mother, Erin Buhrman?

29:24.681 --> 29:25.682
Yes.

29:26.725 --> 29:28.977
Why did your mother kill your father?

29:29.061 --> 29:30.854
To protect me.

29:32.648 --> 29:34.316
My father...

29:36.109 --> 29:37.277
had been...

29:38.237 --> 29:41.156
sexually abusing me for years.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.203
My mother... She found my diary.

29:48.956 --> 29:50.499
She read about it and...

29:51.208 --> 29:53.961
she just wanted to protect me.

29:55.587 --> 29:56.964
What did you do?

29:57.464 --> 30:02.386
There was this old oak tree,it's a very special place for us.

30:02.469 --> 30:06.348
Lanie and I went to go dig up thistime capsule from when we were little kids

30:06.431 --> 30:10.269
and instead we found that.

30:11.353 --> 30:15.524
We found her standing over his body.

30:15.607 --> 30:17.109
And she said...

30:17.609 --> 30:19.528
She swore us to secrecy.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.782
We were just scared kids.

30:23.866 --> 30:26.493
We were just little kids.

30:28.954 --> 30:32.541
I thought I told you twoto go back to bed. Hurry.

30:39.089 --> 30:41.133
Why didn't you tell the police this20 years ago?

30:42.217 --> 30:43.844
Because I didn't remember.

30:43.927 --> 30:47.598
Detective, my client has beendiagnosed with recovered memories.

30:47.681 --> 30:49.808
These are memories unconsciously blocked

30:49.892 --> 30:52.519
due to the high level of stressof the event in question.

30:53.270 --> 30:57.107
Recent events around her familyappear to have reactivated them.

30:59.985 --> 31:01.945
And your testimony to the police?

31:03.947 --> 31:05.490
My mother coached me.

31:06.283 --> 31:07.576
<i>Go ahead.</i>

31:10.954 --> 31:11.997
<i>Say it.</i>

31:12.789 --> 31:14.917
<i>Yes, it was Warren.</i>

31:15.000 --> 31:16.001
<i>Warren Cave?</i>

31:17.544 --> 31:18.545
Lanie.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.675
To be perfectly clear,

31:24.259 --> 31:26.845
you did not see Warren Cavego over the fence?

31:29.389 --> 31:30.516
No.

31:31.266 --> 31:35.562
So your testimony about Warren Cave20 years ago was false?

31:38.315 --> 31:39.316
Yes.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.326
Open 32.

31:50.452 --> 31:52.204
Let's go, Cave. You're free.

32:10.806 --> 32:15.269
<i>Nineteen years ago,I wrote about Warren Cave.</i>

32:16.270 --> 32:18.689
<i>Nineteen years ago,I saw nothing but race.</i>

32:18.772 --> 32:20.274
<i>Mine and his.</i>

32:29.992 --> 32:32.411
<i>His life, my life,</i>

32:32.828 --> 32:35.581
<i>viewed solely through the prism of race.</i>

32:38.125 --> 32:39.334
How do you go on

32:39.418 --> 32:42.963
when the truth that catches you...

32:44.256 --> 32:46.466
irrevocably scars your soul?

32:49.761 --> 32:53.348
<i>How do you rekindle that spark for life</i>

32:53.432 --> 32:57.227
<i>when fate extinguished it years ago?</i>

33:31.553 --> 33:35.682
How do you find the will to press forward

33:35.766 --> 33:38.519
when you don't even knowwhat you're pressing towards?

34:10.967 --> 34:12.219
Hi, Mom.

34:13.929 --> 34:14.929
It's me.

34:42.331 --> 34:43.375
I...

34:45.627 --> 34:48.255
love you too.

35:13.488 --> 35:15.574
If I'm for justice,

35:15.991 --> 35:19.578
no matter who it's for or against,

35:20.454 --> 35:25.250
has justice, in this case,truly been served?

35:36.428 --> 35:38.138
So, are you still planning on staying?

35:39.348 --> 35:40.349
I'd like to.

35:42.601 --> 35:44.269
You're all I've got left.

35:47.773 --> 35:51.235
Do you remember these? These little rings.

35:51.318 --> 35:53.779
They made me feel close to youall these years.

36:03.372 --> 36:06.542
I thought after 20 yearsI finally understood Mom.

36:06.959 --> 36:10.504
That she was trying,trying to be a good mother...

36:12.714 --> 36:15.926
but she was going totell Poppy everything, wasn't she?

36:19.137 --> 36:20.848
The pressure just got to her.

36:22.599 --> 36:26.603
That's why you gave her the pills. For me.

36:32.192 --> 36:36.029
Yes, I mean, everything I do is for you.

36:37.239 --> 36:38.490
Always.

36:40.158 --> 36:43.036
I love you more than you love me,remember?

36:53.338 --> 36:55.799
You're right, but it's impossible, Lanie.

36:56.550 --> 36:57.843
You're too sick.

36:58.677 --> 36:59.970
Poppy was right.

37:01.138 --> 37:02.139
Lanie Dunn?

37:05.642 --> 37:06.643
Josie.

37:06.727 --> 37:08.687
You're under arrestfor the murder of Erin Buhrman.

37:08.770 --> 37:10.272
-Wait. Josie.-Hands behind your back.

37:10.355 --> 37:11.607
Josie. Josie.

37:12.608 --> 37:13.609
Josie!

37:14.401 --> 37:16.028
<i>So, is this justice?</i>

37:16.111 --> 37:20.282
<i>Did I do more harm than goodwith this journey into the past?</i>

37:20.824 --> 37:22.242
For that one...

37:23.869 --> 37:25.037
Well...

37:26.079 --> 37:29.499
the verdict on me will likely berendered by...

37:31.001 --> 37:32.461
the jury in heaven.

37:40.469 --> 37:42.679
Markus. What are you doing here?

37:43.931 --> 37:45.182
Can I come in?

37:45.641 --> 37:46.683
Yeah.

37:47.184 --> 37:51.522
So, your sister, Desiree,

37:51.605 --> 37:55.108
she told me you're moving to New York.

37:55.192 --> 37:56.401
Is that true?

37:56.485 --> 37:58.570
Yeah, it looks like it. But...

37:58.654 --> 38:00.989
Well, it's probablyfor the best anyway, huh?

38:01.073 --> 38:03.617
That's what Ingram wants,but I don't know.

38:05.577 --> 38:08.205
Well, you know,if it makes it any easier...

38:09.331 --> 38:10.999
I was gonna call this a wrap anyway.

38:11.625 --> 38:12.626
What?

38:13.710 --> 38:15.045
The investigating.

38:16.129 --> 38:19.800
You know,you and me doing our thing together.

38:21.343 --> 38:25.639
You know, when I saw you at the barat your father's party,

38:26.431 --> 38:29.142
standing there looking beautiful,

38:29.977 --> 38:32.187
dripping in all kindsof jewels and money...

38:34.690 --> 38:36.859
I rememberedhow much I used to love you...

38:38.694 --> 38:40.320
how much I still love you.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.075
-Markus.-No.

38:46.869 --> 38:48.871
And I was a knuckleheadwhen we were together.

38:48.954 --> 38:51.915
A young punkwho thought he knew everything.

38:52.916 --> 38:58.172
But I didn't know that a womanwho gives you all of her heart

38:58.672 --> 39:01.300
is a rare and elusive thing.

39:03.510 --> 39:04.887
Well, I know that now.

39:08.682 --> 39:10.058
But now it's too late.

39:12.102 --> 39:13.729
And, you know, Ingram, he a...

39:15.856 --> 39:17.107
he's a solid dude.

39:18.775 --> 39:23.155
And I would never ever do anythingto disrupt your life ever.

39:24.907 --> 39:30.120
So, this is me... out.

39:51.934 --> 39:56.855
<i>On the first episode I told youthis show would be different.</i>

39:56.939 --> 40:00.567
<i>That this show would benot just about Warren Cave,</i>

40:00.651 --> 40:03.237
<i>but also about me.</i>

40:04.738 --> 40:06.448
So the question becomes...

40:08.075 --> 40:11.119
Who am I on this side of the journey?

40:12.496 --> 40:17.042
Have I finally become the real me...

40:19.503 --> 40:22.923
or has the real Poppy Parnellburrowed deep down...

40:24.591 --> 40:26.468
even deeper inside?

40:29.179 --> 40:33.183
Only time, the next challenge,the next adversity,

40:33.267 --> 40:37.896
the next brush with fate will tell.

40:41.233 --> 40:42.860
I am Poppy Parnell.
