05:03.386 --> 05:03.928
{\an1}One of the first times I went to

05:04.012 --> 05:05.430
{\an1}the gym, went to reach for my

05:05.513 --> 05:06.347
{\an1}phone, and I realized that it

05:06.431 --> 05:07.390
{\an1}wasn't there.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.016
{\an1}That is the worst feeling in the

05:08.099 --> 05:09.100
{\an1}world.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.018
{\an1}Oh my gosh.

05:10.101 --> 05:10.727
{\an1}The woman at the front desk

05:10.810 --> 05:11.394
{\an1}said, "Would you like me to call

05:11.477 --> 05:13.896
{\an1}your phone for you?"

05:13.980 --> 05:15.356
{\an1}That is a great idea.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.566
{\an1}I had not thought of that.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.233
{\an1}Waiting, I was thinking it was

05:17.316 --> 05:18.651
{\an1}just gonna go to nothing.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.485
{\an1}But she started talking.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.403
{\an1}"Hello?"

05:20.486 --> 05:21.362
{\an1}"Oh my gosh, give me the phone.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.071
{\an1}Who is this?"

05:22.155 --> 05:22.780
{\an1}"I'm Frank."

05:22.864 --> 05:23.948
{\an1}"How did you get my phone?"

05:24.032 --> 05:24.782
{\an1}"The streets, man.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.451
{\an1}It doesn't matter where."

05:26.534 --> 05:27.243
{\an1}My phone had been stolen.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.412
{\an1}Bought a new phone.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.830
{\an1}But I kept the same number.

05:30.913 --> 05:31.789
{\an1}On the drive home, I kept

05:31.873 --> 05:33.374
{\an1}getting calls like every 10 to

05:33.458 --> 05:34.542
{\an1}15 minute.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.084
{\an1}But that night, I finally

05:35.168 --> 05:36.836
{\an1}decided to answer the phone.

05:36.919 --> 05:37.628
{\an1}And there was this guy that was

05:37.712 --> 05:38.504
{\an1}like, "Hey, man, is this

05:38.588 --> 05:40.214
{\an1}Casper?"

05:40.298 --> 05:41.049
{\an1}"Uh."

05:41.132 --> 05:43.426
{\an1}"Come on, man, I got like $250.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.635
{\an1}"I just really wanna buy from

05:44.719 --> 05:45.344
{\an1}you."

05:45.428 --> 05:46.220
{\an1}"And what do you want to buy

05:46.304 --> 05:47.180
{\an1}from me?"

05:47.263 --> 05:48.890
{\an1}"Pffew, man.

05:48.973 --> 05:49.640
{\an1}"You know, anything you can put

05:49.724 --> 05:50.892
{\an1}in the pipe."

05:50.975 --> 05:52.351
{\an1}Uh-huh.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.770
{\an1}This guy is a drug dealer, and

05:53.853 --> 05:56.647
{\an1}his street name is Casper.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.273
{\an1}So the next day I called the

05:57.356 --> 05:58.524
{\an1}police.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.776
{\an1}"Look, it's not like I don't

05:59.859 --> 06:01.402
{\an1}"care, because I do.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.404
{\an1}"But it's just--this isn't worth

06:03.488 --> 06:04.530
{\an1}my time."

06:04.614 --> 06:05.323
{\an1}And then he hung up on me.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.408
{\an1}I just have to take matters into

06:07.492 --> 06:08.618
{\an1}my hands.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.577
{\an1}I gradually started to hatch a

06:09.660 --> 06:10.703
{\an1}plan.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.580
{\an1}I would be a vigilant like Jack

06:12.663 --> 06:13.623
{\an1}Bauer.

06:13.706 --> 06:14.457
{\an1}Damnit!

06:14.540 --> 06:16.125
{\an1}Chu-uh, chu-uh.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.001
{\an1}I was gonna catch this drug

06:17.085 --> 06:17.835
{\an1}dealer.

06:17.919 --> 06:18.711
{\an1}So I decided to set up a sting

06:18.795 --> 06:20.004
{\an1}operation.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.005
{\an1}It was Monday morning, I got a

06:21.089 --> 06:21.798
{\an1}text.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.840
{\an1}"I need an 8 Ball."

06:22.924 --> 06:23.674
{\an1}"Damnit!"

06:23.758 --> 06:24.884
{\an1}I was on the bus.

06:24.967 --> 06:25.885
{\an1}"Hey, it's Angela.

06:25.968 --> 06:26.803
{\an1}Let's make a deal."

06:26.886 --> 06:27.553
{\an1}"Damnit!"

06:27.637 --> 06:28.596
{\an1}I was in English class.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.932
{\an1}"God Damnit, English class."

06:31.015 --> 06:32.100
{\an1}And I realized maybe I need to

06:32.183 --> 06:33.518
{\an1}look the part if I'm gonna be a

06:33.601 --> 06:34.519
{\an1}vigilant.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.062
{\an1}I need to get some black.

06:36.145 --> 06:36.979
{\an1}And I told my whole class,

06:37.063 --> 06:37.605
{\an1}assuming they were all gonna be

06:37.688 --> 06:39.148
{\an1}like, "Wow, Jake, you're

06:39.232 --> 06:39.398
{\an1}amazing."

06:39.482 --> 06:41.192
{\an1}But instead, they were like,

06:41.275 --> 06:42.026
{\an1}"That's ridiculous.

06:42.110 --> 06:42.735
{\an1}"You're gonna get yourself

06:42.819 --> 06:43.778
{\an1}killed."

06:43.861 --> 06:44.612
{\an1}And they told my parents.

06:44.695 --> 06:45.988
{\an1}And my parents were furious.

06:46.072 --> 06:46.989
{\an1}"Damnit, Mom.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.116
{\an1}Damnit, Dad."

06:48.199 --> 06:49.826
{\an1}Just made me want to do it more.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.494
{\an1}I borrowed my friend's phone.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.496
{\an1}And so like I called Frank.

06:53.579 --> 06:53.830
{\an1}"Who is this?"

06:53.913 --> 06:54.372
{\an1}"Um, my name is Eric."

06:54.455 --> 06:55.373
{\an1}"How did you get this phone?"

06:55.456 --> 06:57.083
{\an1}"The streets, man.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.543
{\an1}It doesn't matter where."

06:58.626 --> 06:59.752
{\an1}"Whoa, whoa, what do you want?"

06:59.836 --> 07:00.920
{\an1}"You know what I want, man."

07:01.003 --> 07:01.671
{\an1}"No, literally, like what do you

07:01.754 --> 07:02.713
{\an1}"want? Do you want coke?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.090
{\an1}You want weed?"

07:04.173 --> 07:05.258
{\an1}>> "I want .7 grams

07:05.341 --> 07:06.509
{\an1}of cocaine," which was a

07:06.592 --> 07:07.677
{\an1}common measurement that people

07:07.760 --> 07:08.386
{\an1}had been asking me via text.

07:08.469 --> 07:11.097
{\an1}So I assumed that was a normal

07:11.180 --> 07:12.265
{\an1}thing to ask for.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.641
{\an1}"Okay, uh, I got it in my hand

07:13.724 --> 07:14.559
{\an1}right here."

07:14.642 --> 07:15.643
{\an1}And I gave him explicate

07:15.726 --> 07:17.019
{\an1}directions on how to get to my

07:17.103 --> 07:18.020
{\an1}high school, which, in

07:18.104 --> 07:19.230
{\an1}hindsight, might not have been

07:19.313 --> 07:21.065
{\an1}the very best idea.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.733
{\an1}Chu-chu, chu-chu.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.026
{\an1}So I call the police.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.903
{\an1}"911, what is your emergency?"

07:25.987 --> 07:26.654
{\an1}"There's going to be a drug

07:26.737 --> 07:28.281
{\an1}"dealer at my high school, and

07:28.364 --> 07:29.073
{\an1}"he's going to have

07:29.157 --> 07:30.283
{\an1}".7 grams of cocaine in his

07:30.366 --> 07:30.992
{\an1}possession."

07:31.075 --> 07:31.659
{\an1}"All right, sir, we'll send a

07:31.742 --> 07:32.493
{\an1}squad car."

07:32.577 --> 07:33.286
{\an1}"Well, you're gonna go

07:33.369 --> 07:34.495
{\an1}incognito, right?"

07:34.579 --> 07:36.080
{\an1}"We'll send a squad car, sir."

07:36.164 --> 07:37.874
{\an1}"If you are lying to me, you are

07:37.957 --> 07:40.001
{\an1}gonna have real problems."

07:40.084 --> 07:41.711
{\an1}For an hour, I just waited.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.795
{\an1}I called the police back.

07:42.879 --> 07:43.713
{\an1}"Did you get him?"

07:43.796 --> 07:44.463
{\an1}"No, sir, there was no such car

07:44.547 --> 07:45.298
{\an1}there."

07:45.381 --> 07:46.591
{\an1}"Damnit, operator."

07:46.674 --> 07:47.216
{\an1}I called Frank back, and I was

07:47.300 --> 07:48.217
{\an1}like, "Come on, man, why didn't

07:48.301 --> 07:49.260
{\an1}you show up?"

07:49.343 --> 07:50.052

07:50.136 --> 07:51.095

07:51.179 --> 07:51.846

07:51.929 --> 07:53.222

07:53.306 --> 07:54.223
{\an1}"Like get over it.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.349
{\an1}Wind up or shut up."

07:55.433 --> 07:56.100
{\an1}He kept saying, "If you wanna

{\an1}meet me, wind up or shut up."

07:58.186 --> 08:00.104

08:00.188 --> 08:01.898
{\an1}leave him alone.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.858
{\an1}I chose the shut up option.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.221
{\an1}And Travis is about to like

16:12.304 --> 16:13.681
{\an1}[bleep] himself.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.598
{\an1}And the nurse is asking me

16:14.682 --> 16:15.474
{\an1}questions.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.725
{\an1}And she's like, "You know, when

16:16.809 --> 16:18.310
{\an1}was your last period?"

16:18.394 --> 16:19.186
{\an1}And I told them it was a little

16:19.269 --> 16:21.814
{\an1}late, not realizing that this

16:21.897 --> 16:22.356
{\an1}guy's mom is sitting right

16:22.439 --> 16:24.316
{\an1}there.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.818
{\an1}She starts panicking.

16:25.901 --> 16:26.694
{\an1}Like immediately, you can see

16:26.777 --> 16:28.487
{\an1}she's staring at her son like...

16:32.366 --> 16:33.367
{\an1}And I can't just like shout

16:33.450 --> 16:34.827
{\an1}across the room like,

16:34.910 --> 16:37.413
{\an1}"Hey, I'm a virgin."

16:37.496 --> 16:38.372
{\an1}So she's pissed, my dad's

16:38.455 --> 16:39.456
{\an1}pissed.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.874
{\an1}I'm covered in urine.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.084
{\an1}I'm still bleeding.

16:42.167 --> 16:42.960
{\an1}Nobody has stitched me up yet.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.712
{\an1}This would be the worst date in

16:44.795 --> 16:45.754
{\an1}history.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.380
{\an1}Like it probably is the worst

16:46.463 --> 16:48.298
{\an1}date in history.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.466
{\an1}I think I take the cake.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.384
{\an1}I mean, so far, even though we

16:50.467 --> 16:51.719
{\an1}just met, he was a really great

16:51.802 --> 16:52.428
{\an1}guy.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.303
{\an1}And I really could see myself

16:53.387 --> 16:54.805
{\an1}with a future with him and

16:54.888 --> 16:56.223
{\an1}getting married or losing my

17:24.376 --> 17:25.627
{\an1}Um, so we were there for my

17:25.711 --> 17:26.170
{\an1}senior trip one year.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.796
{\an1}And my girlfriend sends me a

{\an1}trying to date for like five

17:30.841 --> 17:31.675
{\an1}years.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.426
{\an1}The whole time I was in high

17:32.509 --> 17:32.634
{\an1}school.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.927
{\an1}And she tells me that she

17:34.011 --> 17:35.596
{\an1}cheated on me with some guy a

17:35.679 --> 17:36.847
{\an1}couple months back.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.515
{\an1}Damn near made me cry.

17:38.599 --> 17:38.932
{\an1}And so I was like,

17:39.016 --> 17:39.475
{\an1}"You know what? Guess what?

17:39.558 --> 17:40.809
{\an1}"I'm about to go out and have

17:40.893 --> 17:41.518
{\an1}fun."

17:41.602 --> 17:43.353
{\an1}Never drank a day in my life.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.062
{\an1}And I was like, "You know what?

17:44.146 --> 17:44.605
{\an1}"Let's take on some of the

17:44.688 --> 17:46.690
{\an1}hardest liquor we can find."

17:46.774 --> 17:47.524
{\an1}My buddy's like really small.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.442
{\an1}He's like one of the guys who

17:48.525 --> 17:49.735
{\an1}was [unintelligible].

17:49.818 --> 17:51.779
{\an1}Like I can outdrink him by far.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.697
{\an1}I'm 6'3", 240, got big love

17:53.781 --> 17:55.282
{\an1}handles, I can do this.

17:55.365 --> 17:55.866
{\an1}Now I'm drinking, I'm pounding

17:55.949 --> 17:56.617
{\an1}'em back.

17:56.700 --> 17:57.242
{\an1}So I'm like, "You know what?

17:57.326 --> 17:58.285
{\an1}"I'm gonna take two more, 'cause

17:58.368 --> 17:58.827
{\an1}"I'm not drunk right now.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.537
{\an1}I don't feel this happening."

18:00.621 --> 18:01.205
{\an1}My buddy's like, "I guess you

18:01.288 --> 18:02.664
{\an1}"can, man, just, you know,

18:02.748 --> 18:03.832
{\an1}kinda, you know, be okay."

18:03.916 --> 18:04.917
{\an1}So I drink two more double

18:05.000 --> 18:06.710
{\an1}shots.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.377
{\an1}My buddy's like,

18:07.461 --> 18:07.836
{\an1}"Don't take anymore.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.712
{\an1}"It's gonna kill you.

18:08.796 --> 18:09.296
{\an1}This is like unicorn blood."

18:09.379 --> 18:10.214
{\an1}So I take two more when he goes

18:10.297 --> 18:11.131
{\an1}in the bathroom.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.174
{\an1}And there are five stages of

18:12.257 --> 18:14.426
{\an1}what I call drunk.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.886
{\an1}I say you're buzzing, you're

18:15.969 --> 18:17.930
{\an1}tipsy, you're drunk, you're

18:18.013 --> 18:20.390
{\an1}wasted, and your blackout.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.558
{\an1}At this point, I'm like,

18:21.642 --> 18:22.559
{\an1}"Okay, I'm buzzing.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.519
{\an1}"I'm feeling pretty good.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.061
{\an1}"This is--this is going

18:24.144 --> 18:24.937
{\an1}all right."

18:25.020 --> 18:25.604
{\an1}Now my buddy was out on the

18:25.687 --> 18:26.605
{\an1}beach, found these girls.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.314
{\an1}And there's actually one girl

18:27.397 --> 18:28.023
{\an1}sitting on the phone talking to

18:28.106 --> 18:28.899
{\an1}her boyfriend, 'cause she's

18:28.982 --> 18:29.650
{\an1}like, "Whatever, I'm gonna go

18:29.733 --> 18:30.776
{\an1}"whatever.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.319
{\an1}You don't--you don't love me."

18:32.402 --> 18:32.861
{\an1}And I was like, "Okay, this

18:32.945 --> 18:33.862
{\an1}"girl's obviously a prime

18:33.946 --> 18:34.738
{\an1}"suspect.

18:34.822 --> 18:35.364
{\an1}She lives in a trailer like me."

18:35.447 --> 18:36.865
{\an1}Go outside, I'm like, "Girl,

18:36.949 --> 18:37.574
{\an1}you're mine tonight."

18:37.658 --> 18:38.784
{\an1}She's like, "Yes, I am."

18:38.867 --> 18:39.660
{\an1}I close her flip phone that she

18:39.743 --> 18:40.327
{\an1}was talking to her boyfriend

18:40.410 --> 18:40.536
{\an1}with.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.787
{\an1}I pick her up, put her on my

18:41.870 --> 18:42.287
{\an1}back, I'm carrying her.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.039
{\an1}And then, boom, the wasted hits

18:44.122 --> 18:45.666
{\an1}me.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.875
{\an1}All of the sudden, the beach, it

18:46.959 --> 18:47.501
{\an1}goes from being a straight, flat

18:47.584 --> 18:48.919
{\an1}piece of land to turning

18:49.002 --> 18:50.003
{\an1}sideways.

18:50.087 --> 18:50.712
{\an1}Like I don't know like how my

18:50.796 --> 18:51.755
{\an1}buddy's walking on this.

18:51.839 --> 18:52.923
{\an1}This is like a Nascar track.

18:53.006 --> 18:53.799
{\an1}This is ridiculous.

18:53.882 --> 18:54.883
{\an1}And then, boom, the blackout

18:54.967 --> 18:55.676
{\an1}hits me.

18:55.759 --> 18:56.760
{\an1}Now the blackout is when--like

18:56.844 --> 18:58.470
{\an1}you'll blink, and you'll miss 15

18:58.554 --> 18:59.930
{\an1}seconds of your life.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.014
{\an1}Like it just gone out of

19:01.098 --> 19:01.223
{\an1}nowhere.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.057
{\an1}So I blink one time.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.141
{\an1}My buddies are ahead of us.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.352
{\an1}I blink again, and we're kissing

19:05.435 --> 19:06.687
{\an1}back and forth.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.730
{\an1}I blink again, going, reaching

19:08.814 --> 19:09.565
{\an1}hands everywhere.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.024
{\an1}I blink again, just butt naked

19:11.108 --> 19:11.817
{\an1}laying there.

19:11.900 --> 19:12.651
{\an1}I look at her body, and I'm just

19:12.734 --> 19:13.485
{\an1}like, "Uh, this is gonna be

19:13.569 --> 19:14.444
{\an1}good."

19:14.528 --> 19:16.029
{\an1}I blink again, and I had threw

19:16.113 --> 19:17.781
{\an1}up everywhere on her.

19:17.865 --> 19:18.365
{\an1}I'm talking about scattered,

19:18.448 --> 19:20.659
{\an1}smothered, and covered breakfast

19:20.742 --> 19:21.285
{\an1}plate right on her.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.788
{\an1}And I just like pass out.

19:24.872 --> 19:25.831
{\an1}I wake up to my buddy's like,

19:25.914 --> 19:27.791
{\an1}"Get [bleep] [bleep] bed."

19:27.875 --> 19:28.542
{\an1}And my friends, like they're

19:28.625 --> 19:29.459
{\an1}carrying me like I'm coming out

19:29.543 --> 19:30.711
{\an1}of like a war zone.

19:30.794 --> 19:31.670
{\an1}They carry me into the toilet.

19:31.753 --> 19:32.296
{\an1}Sit me down on the toilet, I had

19:32.379 --> 19:35.841
{\an1}threw up, [bleep], pissed,

19:35.924 --> 19:37.968
{\an1}vomited, sneezed, farted,

19:38.051 --> 19:38.760
{\an1}leukemia.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.344
{\an1}Everything just on the [bleep]

19:39.428 --> 19:41.013
{\an1}bed.

19:41.096 --> 19:41.847
{\an1}And at this point, my mom

19:41.930 --> 19:42.431
{\an1}literally texted me, "Don't do

19:42.514 --> 19:45.017
{\an1}anything Jesus wouldn't do."

19:45.100 --> 19:46.351
{\an1}And I was like--[laughing]

19:46.435 --> 19:46.894
{\an1}I was like, "I don't think

19:46.977 --> 19:47.728
{\an1}"Jesus threw up

19:47.811 --> 19:49.021
{\an1}on his [bleep] disciples."

19:49.104 --> 19:50.772
{\an1}It was--it was horrible, man.

19:50.856 --> 19:51.857
{\an1}The girl--I tried to look her up

19:51.940 --> 19:53.567
{\an1}on Twitter, so I put a picture

19:53.650 --> 19:54.818
{\an1}up hoping I would find her.

19:54.902 --> 19:55.903
{\an1}And I said, "Please share.

19:55.986 --> 19:56.820
{\an1}"I think I had something special

19:56.904 --> 19:58.071
{\an1}with this girl."

19:58.155 --> 19:58.906
{\an1}And I actually found her.

19:58.989 --> 19:59.907
{\an1}Got 16,000 retweets.

20:00.824 --> 20:01.909
{\an1}It means a lot.

20:01.992 --> 20:02.534
{\an1}And she messaged me, "Hey,

20:02.618 --> 20:02.784
{\an1}what's up?

20:02.868 --> 20:03.785
{\an1}What are you doing today?"

20:03.869 --> 20:04.494

20:06.246 --> 20:07.915
{\an1}I actually even had a bunch of

20:07.998 --> 20:09.499
{\an1}girls that were messaging me,

20:09.583 --> 20:10.167
{\an1}saying "I wish you would have

20:10.250 --> 20:10.250
{\an1}threw up on me."

20:10.250 --> 20:11.627

20:13.670 --> 20:14.421
