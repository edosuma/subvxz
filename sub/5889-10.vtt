00:35.440 --> 00:36.726
Hang on, hang on!

00:36.920 --> 00:38.968
You're not gonna die today. Hang on.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.330
Okay, okay. Come here. Okay?

01:04.519 --> 01:07.251
All right. Let's get the hell out of here.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.090
Come on, come on.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.606
- What do we have?
- The Factory's been hit and is burning.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.371
All communications down.
No audio or video in or out.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.766
Search and Rescue?

01:41.960 --> 01:44.122
I've no authorization
to dispatch Coast Guard.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.891
- My people are on that rig.
- A level 10 facility.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.770
It does not exist. It never existed.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.570
If you think I'm gonna let you
and the director cover your asses...

01:50.760 --> 01:53.127
...at the expense of the lives
of my people, then...

01:53.320 --> 01:55.800
Off the record, the Factory was bombed
to prevent terrorists...

01:55.960 --> 01:58.008
...from getting their hands
on vital secrets.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.409
On the record,
this incident never occurred.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.007
If you're not interested
in the detainees, fine.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.362
But there are over 75 people
who work for you...

02:06.600 --> 02:08.283
...who are gonna drown and burn.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.126
If you don't contact Search and Rescue,
I will.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.488
Do that
and you will be relieved of duty.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.125
Without confirmation of survivors,
is it really worth making that call?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.806
Reddington! Where's Keen?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.968
Braxton took her.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.089
- Ah.
- Any of these comms working?

02:27.400 --> 02:30.324
That walkie has a range
of a thousand yards at the most.

02:30.960 --> 02:34.726
Unassisted, yeah, but a dipole
antenna array will boost the signal.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.248
This rig is sinking.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.365
If we can't make contact, anyone here
who doesn't burn is gonna drown.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.843
You said Braxton took Keen. Why?

02:50.080 --> 02:51.730
Where am I?

02:51.920 --> 02:54.161
Where are Agents Ressler
and Navabi?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.890
Did they make it?

02:56.080 --> 02:59.562
Don't know. Don't care.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.124
How does it feel...

03:04.320 --> 03:08.211
...to have something people are willing
to die for locked up...

03:08.400 --> 03:11.404
...in that pretty, little head of yours?
- I don't know anything.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.640
We'll see.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.609
I don't know who gave you clearance...

03:35.800 --> 03:38.326
- ...but we're closed to traum...
- He's got a g...

03:42.280 --> 03:43.770
I've been monitoring flights...

03:43.960 --> 03:46.531
...around Norton Sound
with proximity to the Factory.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.451
The FAA picked up an aircraft
entering Juneau airspace...

03:49.640 --> 03:51.130
...ID'd as a medevac chopper.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.529
The FAA doesn't require flight plans
or passenger manifests...

03:54.720 --> 03:58.122
...for medevac choppers. I think
that's how Braxton plans to disappear.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.527
- Where did they land?
- Grace River Hospital.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.764
Notify the hospital.
Make sure they have Braxton's mug shot.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.850
That incident you insist didn't occur,
it just came to shore.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.890
Okay, listen up.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.368
Juneau P.D. was unable to apprehend
Braxton, but he was positively ID'd.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.202
I want surveillance from every camera
within 10 blocks of that hospital.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.085
Coast Guard, they're picking up a signal
from the Factory.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.409
- That's some kind of SOS.
- Survivors.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.683
I'm making that call
whether you like it or not.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.525
We're on final approach.
We need a head count on survivors.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.162
Helo 2. Helo 2.
Emergency message, plus three.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.929
You're not going anywhere.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.644
Let's go.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.561
I'm hitting a wall.

05:06.760 --> 05:07.807
She'll talk.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.445
Oh, no. She's talking.

05:09.640 --> 05:13.440
Told me everything she remembered,
which is nothing.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.729
You saying she wasn't there?

05:16.960 --> 05:19.930
I'm saying if she was there,
she's repressed her memory.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.930
Buried it so deep that I can't even
get her to talk about it.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.924
The Fulcrum.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.644
Where is it?

05:47.400 --> 05:51.405
I envy you your ability
to block a horrible memory.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.931
I needed help to do that.

05:53.920 --> 05:58.244
Lucky for me,
the person who helped me forget...

05:59.200 --> 06:01.885
...is gonna help you remember.

06:03.040 --> 06:07.443
Max, I'm not gonna tell you
to pick up your dominoes again.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.400
Come on. We gotta go. We're late.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.411
Max?

06:14.880 --> 06:16.962
- Max?
- Hey, doc.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.728
- Remember me?
- Braxton.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.969
- It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
- I don't know, doc.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.043
Depends on you.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.444
What do you want?

06:37.560 --> 06:39.642
Let's go for a ride.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.924
The princess here has something
in her head that I want. It's a memory.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.248
Now, you helped make
all my memories go away.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.489
You made Khafji disappear.
Boom.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.964
Just like a magic trick.

06:56.160 --> 07:00.085
I'm thinking, if you were able
to bury one of my memories...

07:01.320 --> 07:03.926
...then you can retrieve some of hers.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.724
No. It's not that simple.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.851
Mom, they...

07:08.040 --> 07:09.690
- They said they won't hurt me...
- Max.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.724
...if you do what they say,
so please, Mom, plea...

07:12.920 --> 07:16.163
Max. Don't hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.081
Guys, there are people looking for me.
If they find me, they'll find you.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.128
Now you are
going to go into her head...

07:25.480 --> 07:27.289
...and you're gonna retrieve a memory.

07:27.480 --> 07:32.088
If you do that, if you help me,
you'll be helping Max.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.520
Do I make myself clear?

07:37.080 --> 07:39.731
Give him a list
of everything you're gonna need.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.121
Sebastian, brother.
I didn't think you made it out.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.051
He didn't. I did.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.888
Oh, man.
This is just like Belgrade, huh, boy-o?

07:55.120 --> 07:56.281
Whatever you want, I get.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.845
This is nothing like Belgrade.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.765
What was the name of that kid?
One you had running point?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.480
Wish I could've been there
when you opened that door...

08:03.680 --> 08:05.444
...found him hanging by your necktie.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.404
His name was Henkel.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.683
Henkel! That's right. Kid was a talker.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.445
You're out of your depth, Luther.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.041
You don't know
the people you're dealing with.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.483
You're a fine thief,
meticulous and careful...

08:18.720 --> 08:21.200
...but this is different.
You're improvising...

08:21.400 --> 08:24.131
...and you and I both know
thinking on your feet...

08:24.320 --> 08:27.290
...is not your strong suit, Luther.
You will make a mistake...

08:27.520 --> 08:29.602
...and when you do, I will be there...

08:29.800 --> 08:32.087
...to indulge
in the undeniable pleasure...

08:32.320 --> 08:36.325
...and sweet satisfaction
of "I told you so."

08:36.520 --> 08:39.842
Well, you better hurry.
Because your girlfriend, the princess...

08:40.080 --> 08:43.482
...she's got the answers in her head
that I'm looking for...

08:43.679 --> 08:45.409
...and I found a way to get them out.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.287
I spoke with Cooper.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.968
The Coast Guard pilots
who transported us are being debriefed.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.881
As far as the rest of the world
is concerned, you are presumed missing.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.163
You need to look
for any known associates of Braxton's...

09:03.360 --> 09:05.089
...with psychiatric medical training.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.726
Neurologists, psychiatrists,
pharmacologists-

09:07.920 --> 09:08.967
Wait. Slow down.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.323
Braxton is trying to extract a memory
from Agent Keen.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.329
He will do so by any means necessary.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.530
He's likely contacted someone
for that purpose already.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.484
Find out who that someone is.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.727
What memory?

09:21.880 --> 09:25.282
A memory she has no memory of.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.364
You said you had the situation...

09:35.560 --> 09:37.369
- ...under control.
- I do.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.848
- The strike was unsuccessful.
- Now we have survivors to contend with.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.407
Not to mention the incident
at the public hospital.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.007
The missile strike will be made public.

09:46.200 --> 09:51.161
It will be blamed on, uh, inmate uprising,
which got out of hand.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.925
Combatants took the facility...

09:53.120 --> 09:55.646
...executed staff,
and were preparing to escape.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.291
We unfortunately had no other choice
but to act aggressively.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.290
Loss of life, although tragic,
was unavoidable.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.609
- Is there any accounting for Reddington?
- Or the Fulcrum?

10:07.800 --> 10:10.041
We will have the Fulcrum
in our hands shortly.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.170
How?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.964
I have a team working on it
as we speak.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.167
Welcome back.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.762
Sir, sir, I think I found a doctor
with a connection to Braxton.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.284
You're safe.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.288
- Uh, what about Mr. Reddington?
- He's pursuing his own leads.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.767
Aram, the doctor?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.321
Yes, right. Uh, sorry.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.887
Okay. Her name is Dr. Selma Orchard.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.401
She's an attending in neurology
at Walter Reed...

10:54.600 --> 10:56.967
...and was part of a team
that discovered a gene...

10:57.160 --> 10:59.242
...that makes it possible
to erase memories.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.285
I'm sorry. Erase memories?

11:01.480 --> 11:05.565
Yeah, the gene is known as Tet1. Critical
to a process called memory extinction...

11:05.760 --> 11:08.923
...where painful events are replaced
with more positive associations.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.521
She was at Walter Reed.
Was Braxton a soldier there?

11:11.720 --> 11:12.881
First Gulf War.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.483
He was part of a friendly fire incident
with multiple casualties in Khafji.

11:17.680 --> 11:21.366
- I assume he brought this home with him.
- Orchard must've treated him for this.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.201
Selma Orchard. Find her now.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.289
It's called recovered memory therapy.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.484
Going to use a combination
of hypnotherapy and pharmaceuticals...

11:30.800 --> 11:33.690
...to put you
into a lucid, waking dream state.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.968
My field is in blocking trauma.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.003
Extracting it, there are probable risks.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.920
You don't have to do this.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.645
I'm going to give you a sedative.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.049
The mind turns things off for a reason.

11:45.240 --> 11:49.165
I found that what the mind fights,
the body tries to fight too.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.162
I need you relaxed.
This is for your own safety.

11:57.600 --> 12:03.050
He told me I need to take you back
to a fire 26 years ago.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.161
I don't wanna go back.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.767
I'm sorry.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.651
P.D. says there's no sign
of forced entry or foul play...

12:22.880 --> 12:24.928
...but Orchard never showed up
for work.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.125
I just got off the phone with the boy's
school. He never showed up, either.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.210
Braxton has them.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.641
Elizabeth, I want you
to close your eyes.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.686
Now I want you to relax
all of the muscles in your body.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.840
Pretend that you can float.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.688
As you float,
all of the tension leaves your body.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.407
Tension floats too...

12:50.080 --> 12:51.605
...but it floats away from you.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.681
Now I want you to breathe in...

12:56.080 --> 12:57.127
...and out.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.927
Good.
All of the tension is floating away.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.282
You can't even feel it anymore.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.365
All you can feel is yourself...

13:09.600 --> 13:14.766
...making the image of yourself
clearer and clearer.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.850
Focus on that image of yourself.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.883
Only it's not you today.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.648
It's you 26 years ago.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.041
You can almost picture her,
that little girl.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.840
I'm gonna ask the little girl
to open her eyes.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.120
Are you ready?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.924
Three...

13:38.120 --> 13:39.724
...two...

13:40.120 --> 13:41.326
...one.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.169
What do you see?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.971
A little girl...

13:50.280 --> 13:53.170
- ...hiding.
- Okay, stay here, sweetie.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.768
No matter what happens, stay here
and don't come out till I come get you.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.081
Understand?

13:58.280 --> 14:00.282
- Are you with her?
- Yes.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.363
- Where is she?
- She'll be here.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.085
Hey, what's your bunny's name?

14:04.320 --> 14:06.368
I'm not leaving without Masha. Masha!

14:06.560 --> 14:08.324
She's not going back with you.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.887
I know you're scared, but it's okay.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.529
Lizzy? Can you hear me?

14:13.720 --> 14:16.530
- I'll just be with her.
- You wouldn't let me see her.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.449
- Masha?
- Get out!

14:23.880 --> 14:27.407
Hello. Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.331
Time is of the essence,
so I'll skip introductions.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.161
I've asked you all here because you all
have one thing in common.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.886
You all have business
with Luther Braxton.

14:37.320 --> 14:42.281
As rewarding as those relationships
may have been, they've come to an end.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.410
Mr. Braxton has started something
he cannot finish.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.728
He'll likely reach out
to one of you for help.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.209
When he does, you will contact me
at the number I have provided.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.402
Questions?

14:57.040 --> 14:58.246
Good.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.968
What's in it for us?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.043
Life.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.048
- Where are we on Dr. Orchard?
- Nowhere.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.971
If Braxton did abduct her,
he didn't leave a trace.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.207
And Reddington?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.687
If he had a lead,
we would have heard from him.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.487
Metro P.D. just called in a possible
visual on Braxton near Anacostia.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.048
He saw him get into a van with a couple
of men after Orchard's abduction.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.447
- Did they track it?
- No, patrolman was on foot.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.766
The van left
before he could flag the plate.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.960
Get to Anacostia,
canvass the neighborhood.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.563
Knock on every door. If Braxton was there
to meet someone, I wanna know who.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.450
Cooper.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.164
Hello, Dr. Levin.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.408
Did you get the results?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.841
Yes. At your office?

15:51.800 --> 15:55.521
This is not gonna work. These drugs,
she could become hypotensive.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.411
- I gave you what you asked for.
- We need an anesthesiologist...

15:58.640 --> 16:00.961
...or an ER doc here.
I told you there are risks.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.766
Well, then take the risks.
It's either her or your boy.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.441
- Think you'd get away with it?
- What's happening?

16:23.120 --> 16:24.770
They're shouting.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.923
- Who?
- What are they saying?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.202
Where is she?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.289
- You are in trouble.
- Because of you.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.244
- Yes!
- Don't be afraid.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.523
- You told her.
- Yes, I did. I told her.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.807
- Come on!
- Wait!

16:39.000 --> 16:40.684
- Come on!
- Lizzy.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.689
Come on.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.163
Come on!

16:53.480 --> 16:55.840
- Where did he go?
- Where did he go? I don't know.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.729
- Ha-ha-ha.
- What's happening?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.968
She might be having
a tangent memory.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.642
Her brain is trying to replace
a bad memory with a good one.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.410
Over there! Here!

17:06.280 --> 17:07.884
Catch me.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.242
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

17:10.720 --> 17:13.723
- Lizzy.
- Lizzy, wait!

17:13.920 --> 17:18.130
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪

17:21.119 --> 17:23.599
- What is it? What do you see?
- Stay here.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.088
Don't go anywhere.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.202
- What are they fighting about?
- It's a secret.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.686
Who's Masha?

17:39.880 --> 17:42.724
- You are.
- Instead they framed Masha.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.888
Don't go out there.
You can't go out there.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.167
Turn around, Lizzy! Go back!

18:02.480 --> 18:04.369
No! No!

18:04.600 --> 18:06.409
Don't! Daddy said not to come out!

18:17.480 --> 18:20.370
Okay, we're done.
Her blood pressure's through the roof.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.449
She's in V-tach. She needs lidocaine.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.166
What do you think you're doing?

18:26.360 --> 18:29.443
You won't find what you're looking for
if she's dead.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.046
My father.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.768
My father was there.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.890
What have you got?

18:48.080 --> 18:50.686
Braxton contacted me
right after you left.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.800
- What's this?
- Wiring instructions...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.923
...to an offshore account.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.886
I'm not giving you this information.
I'm selling it.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.687
Let me clarify the situation. Braxton
is holding a hostage. I want her back.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.884
Every second you waste
reduces the chances of that happening.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.441
- I appreciate your urgency.
- I don't think you do.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.371
But I'm not telling you anything
until we agree on a price.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.402
I have units
covering the southwest sector.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.683
So start at the north end of the 700 block
and work your way back.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.049
- Anything?
- Two eyewitnesses confirm...

19:25.240 --> 19:28.528
...Braxton met with a Wilson Bishop.
I had Aram run his profile.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.200
He's a third-year med student
at Johns Hopkins.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.841
What does Braxton want
with a med student?

19:35.240 --> 19:38.084
Your son, what's his name?

19:38.520 --> 19:40.602
His name is Max.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.728
He's 9 years old.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.768
I'm sorry.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.771
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.401
In the dream, your father,
you said he was there?

19:58.400 --> 20:01.051
The girl, she called him "Daddy."

20:01.360 --> 20:03.806
Did you see anything else
or hear anything else?

20:04.520 --> 20:07.922
The little girl stopped me.
It's like she has some kind of a secret.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.201
But I'm the girl.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.290
Girl's a piece of your subconscious
trying to prevent you...

20:12.520 --> 20:14.329
...from becoming aware
of what happened.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.451
I have no recollection
of my mother or my father.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.407
Not their faces, nothing.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.925
All I know, or think I know,
is that my father gave me this.

20:27.240 --> 20:31.165
You can relax. An extra 15 seconds
won't make a difference either way.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.526
It's done.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.726
Speak.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.691
He needed a place to meet someone,
someplace out of the way.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.446
The address?

20:55.880 --> 21:01.330
He's right. An extra 15 seconds
probably won't change anything. Hmm?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.447
Yes?

21:09.160 --> 21:11.891
- Mom? Mommy?
- Max!

21:12.120 --> 21:14.202
- Mom?
- Max, hi. Are you okay, baby?

21:14.720 --> 21:17.121
- Where are you?
- Every/thing's gonna be okay.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.608
I love you. I love you. Just...

21:20.920 --> 21:22.570
You have till 9:00.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.691
If I don't find out what the agent knows
by then, you'll never see your boy again.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.168
Wait. Wait! Damn it!

21:33.760 --> 21:35.330
It's gonna be fine.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.081
It's too dangerous.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.409
Something happened, something
people are willing to kill to find...

21:40.600 --> 21:42.568
...and whatever it was
involved my father.

21:43.720 --> 21:47.008
I'm not doing this for Braxton
or for you.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.002
I'm doing it for me.
I need to know the truth.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.325
Where is it?

22:11.680 --> 22:14.126
I'll have it to you by 9.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.641
I thought you said you had it already.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.251
And I do.

22:18.920 --> 22:23.005
I wanted that Fulcrum in my hands
before I negotiated with you.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.844
Need I remind you
that the price had already been set?

22:27.440 --> 22:31.126
That was before you volleyed missiles
at me and my men.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.446
Now the price has gone up.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.328
Mr. Braxton...

22:41.200 --> 22:43.043
...I don't think you fully appreciate...

22:43.240 --> 22:46.323
...the power of the people
who have engaged your services.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.363
Well, if they're that powerful...

22:48.560 --> 22:52.042
...then I'm sure they can afford
an extra 10 percent.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.849
Go find the money, chief.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.601
You do that...

23:01.640 --> 23:04.484
...and I'll have what you want by 9:00.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.327
I want you to call me as soon
as you get confirmation of funds.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.841
Nah, we'll get the intel
out of that girl's head...

23:17.080 --> 23:21.642
...even if I gotta drill a hole in her
skull and hang her upside down.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.281
All right. Will do.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.404
If you're looking for your driver,
he's napping in the trunk.

23:41.640 --> 23:42.926
Son of a bitch.

23:44.480 --> 23:48.610
Luther, I never thought I'd enjoy
having anything in my mouth...

23:48.800 --> 23:51.690
...as much
as Petty Officer Virginia Sherman.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.600
But this?

23:53.800 --> 23:57.691
Heh, my God! It tastes so good!

23:57.880 --> 24:01.248
I hesitate to swallow
and I certainly don't wanna spit it out.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.249
Oh, what the hell.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.010
I told you so.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.882
Elizabeth Keen. Where is she?

24:13.360 --> 24:14.964
I don't know.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.730
Maybe she's dead.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.603
Maybe you're too late, boy-o.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.688
Just like you were for Henkel
in Belgrade.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.444
Can I let you in on a little secret
about Belgrade?

24:31.640 --> 24:33.085
I barely remember it.

24:33.320 --> 24:37.120
I'd forgotten about the deutsche marks,
and I don't think I ever even met Henkel.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.846
Tell you the truth,
I don't think his name was Henkel.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.208
I don't know who the hell he was,
but this...

24:42.400 --> 24:46.724
...this, I can promise you,
I will always remember.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.605
Now get in the damn car.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.125
Elizabeth, can you hear me?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.087
Nod if you can hear me.

25:06.560 --> 25:10.042
Good. Now follow my voice
and tell me where you are.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.683
- The closet.
- What's happening?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.009
They'll kill you
if you don't give it back.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.766
They'll kill me if I do.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.046
They're arguing.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.004
What are they arguing about?

25:23.800 --> 25:27.282
Did you really think I'd let this
happen? That I wouldn't come for her?

25:27.480 --> 25:28.891
Hey, you know what?

25:29.080 --> 25:31.048
The Fulcrum.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.244
It's the only thing keeping me alive.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.241
Wilson Bishop, FBI.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.767
Come here. Come here.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.691
Hey, hey. What are you doing,
man? What are you doing?

25:59.880 --> 26:03.089
- Braxton. You met with him.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

26:03.280 --> 26:06.204
You're a resident at a hospital
with access to all kinds...

26:06.400 --> 26:08.721
...of psychopharmaceuticals.
You sold to him.

26:08.960 --> 26:12.328
- He kidnapped an FBI agent.
- Don't know anything about a kidnapping.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.481
He's gonna use your drugs
on that agent.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.290
- She dies...
- He wanted diazoxide.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.000
- Naloxone...
- Where is he?

26:20.040 --> 26:23.044
- Had me deliver equipment for sedations.
- An address!

26:23.240 --> 26:26.005
Braxton, call me back.
Where the hell are you?

26:43.840 --> 26:45.171
Is she okay?

26:45.360 --> 26:47.169
I'm not gonna hurt you.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.403
Is she okay?

26:52.840 --> 26:54.285
Aram, we found Wilson Bishop.

26:54.480 --> 26:58.405
We're en route, and we need you
to send units to Coal Chute and Spring.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.800
Donald. I have information
regarding Agent Keen's abductor.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.365
On our way. Ten minutes out.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.649
Well, Braxton was holding a young boy.
His name is Max Orchard.

27:08.840 --> 27:12.481
My people have secured the boy, send
a unit. Dembe will give you the address.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.685
Max is my son.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.247
The FBI are on their way to him now.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.926
She's still heavily sedated.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.771
What happened?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.480
- But my son, Max.
- Your son is gonna be fine.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.128
Tell me about Agent Keen.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.642
She was undergoing a procedure
called RM therapy.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.724
Braxton was searching for a memory.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.888
Does she remember the past'?

27:46.240 --> 27:47.287
Pieces.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.446
- What pieces?
- A fire, an argument.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.722
She remembers something
called the Fulcrum.

27:56.360 --> 27:59.443
Does she know where it is,
the Fulcrum?

27:59.640 --> 28:01.005
No.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.444
But we were close.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.689
If she continued,
would it be dangerous for her?

28:12.920 --> 28:14.649
Could she be harmed in any way?

28:14.880 --> 28:18.282
It's hard to say.
She's been through a lot.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.451
But typically, if the therapy
is done properly and with great care...

28:23.560 --> 28:25.324
...then, no.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.560
Split up. It's gotta be the
basement or the attic.

28:36.760 --> 28:39.525
Can you see it?
Can you hear me, Lizzy?

28:40.480 --> 28:43.290
- Take her to...
- I need you to tell me where it is.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.683
- Where is the Fulcrum, Lizzy?
- Let me go! Get away from me!

28:46.880 --> 28:49.929
Shh, shh. You don't wanna see this.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.371
What you want to see,
what you need to find is the Fulcrum.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.642
Where is it, Lizzy? Can you see it?

28:58.760 --> 29:01.206
Lizzy, turn around. Go back.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.565
You don't wanna go in there.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.406
Lizzy, turn around and go back.
Go back, go back.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.371
What happened?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.046
What did she see?

29:24.280 --> 29:26.851
Listen to me. You have to say something.
There's a fire.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.805
I know you saw something
and you don't wanna go out there...

29:30.000 --> 29:31.650
...but you can't stay here.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.002
You have to scream. Do you hear me?

29:34.200 --> 29:37.010
As loud as you can, you have to scream!
You have to...

30:05.040 --> 30:07.964
What the hell are you doing to her?
What are you doing?

30:08.200 --> 30:10.680
- Get her up. Wake her up now.
- Not now.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.362
- Reddington. Reddington!
- It's not safe.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.048
- Wake her up now.
- Wait. Not now.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.811
You do what you have to do.
You do it now!

30:42.000 --> 30:43.843
Wait.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.760
Daddy! No!

31:49.040 --> 31:51.088
You were there.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.408
You were there, weren't you?

32:35.640 --> 32:37.244
Yes.

32:40.520 --> 32:45.686
There were people with the woman,
looking for it.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.840
The Fulcrum. You were one of them.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.520
It's not that simple.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.683
But that's why you were there.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.209
That's why you came into my life then.

33:04.520 --> 33:07.091
And that's why you're here now.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.887
Not because of me...

33:11.280 --> 33:13.044
...or who I am to you...

33:13.240 --> 33:16.164
...whatever connection
we might have...

33:16.680 --> 33:19.286
...but because of some...

33:21.080 --> 33:22.889
...object.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.648
Some thing.

33:28.360 --> 33:29.805
Whatever you remember...

33:30.000 --> 33:35.769
What I remember is leaving my father
dying on the floor of a burning house.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.282
There's no way
he could have survived that.

33:44.720 --> 33:48.361
Lizzy, the memories
of a 4-year-old are...

33:49.080 --> 33:50.889
...unreliable.

33:52.200 --> 33:55.124
My father was killed
because of the Fulcrum...

33:55.320 --> 33:58.449
...because you and your people
came for it that night.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.685
Well, I want you to know something.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.687
This charade...

34:05.360 --> 34:08.409
...of you pretending to care about me...

34:08.719 --> 34:11.199
...was a waste of your time...

34:11.679 --> 34:13.967
...because I don't know where it is.

34:14.159 --> 34:15.605
Don't!

34:24.719 --> 34:27.326
- Mommy.
- Max! Ah.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.882
Are You Okay? Are you okay?
Are you okay?

34:39.080 --> 34:40.570
Look at you.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.485
Oh, thank God.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.163
Mm. I'm meeting with Braxton
within the hour.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.847
Yes, of course
I've discussed contingencies...

34:51.040 --> 34:54.328
...regarding Reddington
with all of our colleagues.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.761
I'm going to have to call you back.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.249
You wouldn't believe
how much he weighs.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.965
Sit.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.244
Do you have any idea who I am?

35:18.720 --> 35:22.566
Yes. I know just what you are.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.962
Sit the hell down.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.530
I've alerted security.

35:29.720 --> 35:33.042
You seem younger in person
than you appear to be...

35:33.240 --> 35:36.767
...when lurking in the background
on television. Are you a swimmer?

35:38.720 --> 35:42.805
- I'm someone not to be trifled with.
- Mm.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.082
Then we have something in common.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.290
You hire a simple thief
to find the Fulcrum...

35:49.480 --> 35:52.086
...because you believe I don't have it.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.203
So I return him to you,
defects and all...

35:54.400 --> 35:57.370
...to make it abundantly clear
that you should never again...

35:57.560 --> 36:01.281
...doubt who I am and what I have.

36:01.480 --> 36:05.121
I know exactly who you are.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.561
A thug.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.527
You may have convinced
some of my colleagues...

36:09.720 --> 36:11.927
...that you are a force
to be reckoned with...

36:12.120 --> 36:14.282
...but I do not share that assessment.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.248
So consider yourself warned.

36:17.480 --> 36:22.122
We will not hesitate
to use every resource at our disposal.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.567
Whatever it takes...

36:25.320 --> 36:27.084
...we will cripple you.

36:28.320 --> 36:32.006
I don't think
you have any real comprehension...

36:32.200 --> 36:36.728
...of the depth and breadth
of your vulnerability.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.608
But only the one who possesses
the Fulcrum could possibly fathom that.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.720
I think you're bluffing.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.722
I don't think you have it.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.208
I don't think you ever did.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.484
Try me.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.648
Call my bluff. Please.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.046
Call my bluff.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.449
Heh. Oh, my God. I don't know
what the hell you're gonna do with him.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.562

he's like a damn side of beef.

This morning,
there was an attempted takeover...

...of a U. S. detention camp
in the Norton Sound.

37:39.600 --> 37:44.288
We believe that the timing
of this uprising was set to coincide...

37:44.480 --> 37:48.724
...with the transfer of international
fugitive Raymond Reddington.

37:48.920 --> 37:52.163
Are you saying that
he was responsible for the breach?

37:52.360 --> 37:54.960
How did he orchestrate
an attack if he was in custody?

37:55.080 --> 37:57.287
Did he succeed?

I didn't mean to alarm you,

38:58.560 --> 39:00.642

Liz, I don't think I'm the first one

39:09.600 --> 39:10.931
No. I've never been treated.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.845
You may not remember.
You may have been very young.

39:14.360 --> 39:19.207
But I think someone may have tried
to block your memory of that fire.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.481
I didn't make it up.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.329
