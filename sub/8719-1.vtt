01:33.894 --> 01:39.161
Sometimes, I think
about what we must sound like to God.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.902
How does He know
who's in trouble and needs help?

01:53.580 --> 01:56.515
How did He know to come to us?

01:58.118 --> 02:01.281
What you are about to see is true.

02:01.355 --> 02:04.347
The names have not been changed...

02:04.425 --> 02:07.223
because nobody believes me anyway.

Hi, Saul. How're you doin'?

02:57.911 --> 03:00.209
Beverly, it's so nice to see you.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.805
- Hey, Mommy.

- % Ohh, He's on His way%
- % Hold on%

03:06.086 --> 03:10.750
That's my mom. The Lord
blessed her with the gift of song.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.622
She's been singing
in this church her whole life.

Her father used to be
the reverend here.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.813
But he's not anymore.
My daddy is.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.044
That's him...
the one holding his head.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.814
He's not looking too happy...

03:40.921 --> 03:44.823
which is sort of how
this whole story happened.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.495
% Help is on the way%

03:53.567 --> 03:57.765
That's my grandma.
She's staying with us for the holidays.

03:57.838 --> 04:02.605
Everyone says she needs a man...
whatever that means.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.701

04:18.091 --> 04:22.255
Oh, yes!
Hallelujah!

04:23.730 --> 04:25.891
Oh, yeah!

04:29.036 --> 04:30.970
Let the church say, "Amen."

04:31.038 --> 04:35.634
Look at this, Osbert.
Ninety-six dollars and a button.

04:35.709 --> 04:39.076
Button! Who would put a button
in the collection...?

04:39.146 --> 04:41.706
Oh.

04:41.782 --> 04:46.242
- Times are hard, Saul.
- The church can't pay its bills on that.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.912
Amen.

04:48.088 --> 04:52.388
Beloved, in our exploration
of the text today...

04:52.459 --> 04:55.519
I would like to talk to you
about temptation.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.587
Mm-hmm.
Amen.

04:57.664 --> 05:02.158
And not just the kind you find in
the liquor store or someone else's bed.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.261
I'm talking about
temptation of the soul.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.772
Mm-hmm.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.606
The kind that just kinda, kinda...

05:10.677 --> 05:13.111
kinda creeps up on you
without you even knowing it.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.774
- But God knows.
- % God knows%

05:22.289 --> 05:26.555
God is that little voice inside
that says, "Don't give in."

05:26.627 --> 05:27.889
% Don't give in%

05:27.961 --> 05:29.952
- Don't give up.
- % Don't give up%

05:30.030 --> 05:31.725
Be gone, temptation!

05:31.798 --> 05:34.130
He knows you're tired.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.364
That's why He says,
"Lean on me."

05:38.372 --> 05:43.469
% Lean%

05:43.543 --> 05:47.536
- % Lean%
- Aw.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.749
He knows you're tempted.

05:56.723 --> 06:00.159
That's why He says,
"Grab on to me...

06:00.227 --> 06:03.492
and together we will rise above."

06:04.331 --> 06:06.265
Amen.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.359
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:09.436 --> 06:12.599
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you...

06:12.739 --> 06:15.230
thought I needed
some help in there.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.675
Well, when I realized you were
doing one of Daddy's old sermons...

06:18.745 --> 06:21.509
I thought maybe you did.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.015
I was...

06:24.084 --> 06:27.645
hoping that he could make
a difference, even if I can't.

06:31.258 --> 06:34.250
If you ask me,
you did even better than he did.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.696
Really.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.362
I appreciate your support, honey.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.870
Father, forgive me.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.966
I'd like to talk to you
about temptation.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.511
The kind that creeps up on you.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.377
And that's me, Jeremiah.

06:55.449 --> 06:58.043
Are you after Daddy's job already?

06:58.118 --> 07:02.521
Well, this is the story.
My didn't-make-it-up story.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.217
- It was one week before Christmas.
- Come on.

07:05.292 --> 07:09.228
The Christmas
I learned all about miracles.

07:09.296 --> 07:14.029
I asked Santa Claus to bring me
a brother for Christmas.

07:14.101 --> 07:18.037
Well, Santa doesn't make
those kinds of deliveries, baby.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.130
Oh.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.300
Can Hakim have lunch with us?

07:22.375 --> 07:26.334
Well, I think Hakim's grandma
might want him around today, you know?

07:26.413 --> 07:29.382
But he's my best friend.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.384
Well, maybe she won't
miss him for a while.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.411
- But then you and I
are going downtown, okay?
- Okay.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.924
- Be careful crossing the street.
- I will.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.450
- Look both ways.
- Hakim!

07:42.562 --> 07:45.725
- Don't wake his grandma.
- Hakim!

07:45.799 --> 07:47.767
Come on, come on!

07:47.834 --> 07:50.667
Hurry up! All right!

07:50.737 --> 07:52.762
Let's play, Jeremiah!

07:52.839 --> 07:54.773
Okay.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.900
Let's build a snowman.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.242
Come on over here.
Come on over here.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.577
- Huh! Huh!

08:02.649 --> 08:04.583
% Hold on%

08:04.651 --> 08:06.710
% Hold on%

08:06.787 --> 08:08.755

08:10.991 --> 08:12.925

08:12.993 --> 08:16.759
Child, I'm the only help
in this house.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.596
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Now that was a lovely sermon.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.795
Even better the second time.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.861
Mama, please.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.965
I told you about smoking in the house.
You shouldn't be smoking at all.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.443
Well, there's a lot of things
I shouldn't be doing at all.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.648
Oh, poor Hakim.

08:39.719 --> 08:43.052
Bad enough his mama ran out,
but to leave him with his grandma.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.490
Bessie Adams can't
take care of no five-year-old!

08:46.560 --> 08:48.994
You know that woman's
two days older than dirt!

08:49.062 --> 08:50.996
Well, she won't
have to much longer.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.727
- Child Welfare's gonna take him now.
- What?

08:54.801 --> 08:57.736
Julia, they're closing
the youth center today.

08:57.804 --> 09:01.296
I have to say good-bye to the kids.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.672
What is his problem?

09:03.743 --> 09:06.974
There is no problem, Ma.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.982
Yeah, and I'm the Queen of the Nile!

09:10.050 --> 09:13.645
Julia, something's been going on
in this house for months now.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.086
I can hear it in your voice
over the phone.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.091
- Mom, maybe you've been
dialing the wrong number.
- Oh, yeah?

09:19.159 --> 09:22.185
Well, somebody just better get
their house in order. That's all I know.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.924
- Well, don't look at me, Ma, okay?
- I'm lookin' at you!

09:24.998 --> 09:28.798
All right. Well, Mama,
you can look at me from behind.

09:28.869 --> 09:33.897
Girl, don't be talkin' to me about
your behind. I gave you that behind!

09:34.107 --> 09:37.167
I don't even know
why I bother wearing this.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.270
It's not doing anyone any good.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.281
And neither am I.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.054
Lord...

09:53.126 --> 09:57.062
I know You're especially busy
this time of year, but...

09:57.130 --> 09:59.894
I'm just a little tired.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.868
If You get a moment,
I sure could use some help.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.872
- Mine's bigger!
- Mine's bigger!

10:06.940 --> 10:10.068
- Mine's much bigger!
- Mine's bigger!

10:14.447 --> 10:19.350
Why did you throw snow at me?
It's all down my neck!

10:22.389 --> 10:24.323
Wow.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.258
- Huh?
- Where'd you come from?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.263
You okay?

10:31.331 --> 10:34.027
No.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.897
You okay?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.938
No. Aaaaaaah!

10:39.005 --> 10:40.939
Hide, run, Hakim, run!

10:41.007 --> 10:44.670
- Wait a... Wait a minute!
- Quick, hurry!

10:44.744 --> 10:48.407
- Here. Hide here.
- I'm here! I'm here!

10:48.481 --> 10:51.314
I'm here!

10:53.119 --> 10:55.781
Thank You, Dear God.
Thank You.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.851
I'm here!

10:59.926 --> 11:02.394
- What's he doing?
- Huh?

11:05.799 --> 11:08.859
I'm here!

11:08.935 --> 11:12.962
I'm here!

11:13.039 --> 11:17.738
Ma, it's a snowman.
A real one!

11:17.811 --> 11:21.372
Joe Hamilton's tearin'
down everything. Why's he doin' it?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.882
Yeah, man, where're we
supposed to chill at now?

11:23.950 --> 11:26.885
They're tryin' to see us
get locked up or shot or something.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.888
Listen to me, listen. It just means
you've got to work that much harder...

11:29.956 --> 11:32.117
try that much harder
to stay out of trouble.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.888
- I'm gonna do my thing.
- Peace, man.

11:34.961 --> 11:38.488
- I'm sorry.
- Where are we supposed to go now?

11:38.565 --> 11:41.762
- I don't know, man.
- You did your best, pastor.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.769
Yeah, you tried.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.271
- Thank you, son.
- Bye.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.671
- Y'all take care of yourselves.
- What do you want to do?

11:48.742 --> 11:52.337
- I don't know.
- Well, it's too cold to stay out.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.248
Tough break, huh?

11:56.316 --> 11:58.409
Kinda seems like
they're all tough these days.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.419
You Henry Biggs?

12:00.487 --> 12:04.617
- Yes, I'm the pastor over at St. Matt's.
- Bingo!

12:04.691 --> 12:06.921
Every Friday, 8:00.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.962
- My name's Dudley.
- Nice to meet you, Dudley.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.964
- Pleasure.
- You a reporter?

12:12.032 --> 12:14.500
- No. No, no.
- Social worker?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.730
- No, I'm here in answer to your request.
- My request?

12:17.837 --> 12:19.737
For help?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.304
Is this some kind of joke?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.970
Uh, no, no.
He doesn't make jokes.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.071
He?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.114
Capital "H", capital "E".

12:37.190 --> 12:39.522
I want you to know that
together the three of us...

12:39.592 --> 12:42.026
can help get you through
this little crisis you're having.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.791
- Look, I don't know who you are.
- Dudley, I'm Dudley.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.798
- Or who put you up to this.
- He did.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.801
But I'm afraid you picked
the wrong day for me to be a good sport.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.803
- Now, will you excuse me?
- Sure.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.466
- Thank you.
- Wow.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.510
I'm sorry.

12:57.577 --> 13:01.377
I'll, uh...

13:01.448 --> 13:04.747
try another approach.

13:04.818 --> 13:09.812
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Thank you, sister. Merry Christmas.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.983
I've been waitin' a long time for this.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.789
- Yeah?
- Yes, sir.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.299
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.335
Hey, don't that cheese
burn the roof of your mouth?

13:23.403 --> 13:26.702
Hmm?

13:26.773 --> 13:29.333
Um...

13:32.579 --> 13:35.377
Uh, you...
you know Reverend Biggs?

13:35.448 --> 13:38.884
- Sure, from St. Matt's.
- Yeah, that's the one.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.718
Stubborn, isn't he? Kinda short
with people too. Didn't you notice?

13:42.789 --> 13:46.281
This man right here?

13:46.359 --> 13:49.351
Not that I know him that well.
I'm just...

13:49.429 --> 13:53.957
- He came to the hospital every
day after my wife's surgery.
- Every day?

13:54.033 --> 13:56.092
He baptized all five of my kids.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.296
- All five of them?
- Yeah. Give me this.

13:58.371 --> 14:02.273
- Wait. I didn't mean anything.
- Go on, get on out of here!

14:02.342 --> 14:05.800
You better go. Get on outta here.
And don't come back.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.042
I'm telling you, Mama, he was there.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.049
Like he fell from the sky.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.779
Then he did a dance and jumped around.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.549
Mommy's gonna stop giving you
sugar cereal in the morning, baby.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.682
- Come on. Who's that?
- Ho, ho, ho.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.316
- Santa Claus!
- Merry Christmas!

14:21.394 --> 14:24.056
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Santa.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.564
- Thank you, little bro.
- Here, put some money in.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.899
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.404
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- Thank you, sir.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.670
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you, buddy.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.678
- Osbert! Merry Christmas!
- How've you been, sister?

14:39.746 --> 14:44.342
- Shh. Mm-mm.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.783
- Come on, Jeremiah.
- Ho, ho, ho!

14:46.853 --> 14:48.912
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, brother.

14:49.022 --> 14:53.755
God bless Mommy and Daddy
and Grandma and Hakim.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.760
- Amen.
- Amen.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.853
Okay, fella, let's get into bed.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.691
Legs under.
Thank you.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.703
All right.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.936
I'm going to be sad when he goes.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.909
We all will.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.707
We'll all miss Hakim.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.750
Will I have to go
live with another family too?

15:19.519 --> 15:23.216
Of course not, Jeremiah.
Of course not.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.894
Get some sleep.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.726
I will if you sing to me.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.732
All right.

15:35.401 --> 15:41.306
% Who made the mountains%

15:41.374 --> 15:45.504
% Who made the trees%

15:45.578 --> 15:49.446
% Who writes the songs%

15:49.549 --> 15:54.885
% For the robins to sing%

15:56.889 --> 16:01.019
% And who sends the rain%

16:11.604 --> 16:19.534

16:19.612 --> 16:23.309
Leave the door open, please.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.686
Okay, but go to sleep.

16:27.754 --> 16:31.019
- Okay.
- Sweet dreams.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.024
Get down! Get down!

16:37.597 --> 16:39.622
All right, come on!

16:41.634 --> 16:44.694
- Come on, let's get in the car.

16:44.804 --> 16:49.798
Pull up the car! Come on!
Let's go! Get in! Go, go, go!

16:53.680 --> 16:56.376
Over here! Over here!

16:56.449 --> 16:59.384
Help me, help me, look!

16:59.452 --> 17:02.478
- Hey, hey, calm down.
- They robbed me! They broke my window!

17:02.555 --> 17:05.490
- That's him over there!
- That's him? Freeze!

17:05.558 --> 17:07.651
- That's him over there.
- Don't shoot.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.424
- Turn around!
- That ain't mine, man. He dropped it.

17:11.497 --> 17:15.058
- Get against the wall.
- I was returning a tape, man.
I live right down the street.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.034
That was you.
I saw you break my window!

17:17.136 --> 17:19.900
- I was at the ATM.
- You have the right to remain silent.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.566
I have the receipt in my pocket!

17:25.578 --> 17:30.106
Billy looked so sad. Why did they have
him in handcuffs? He's not a criminal.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.983
Do you think they'll give him dinner?
He hasn't had anything since lunch.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.817
- I know he's hungry.
- He'll just be there overnight.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.585
His bail hearing will be set
for sometime tomorrow.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.025
Has he ever been
in trouble before?

17:42.095 --> 17:45.326
- Two years ago.
- Oh, great!

17:45.398 --> 17:49.129
I was able to get the judge to give him
probation, as long as I found him a job.

17:49.202 --> 17:53.195
- And you did.
- I promised I would straighten him out.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.206
Looks like I didn't do
such a good job.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.208
Oh, no.
He's a different kid now.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.210
Watches the little ones
while I'm at work.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.439
I don't know what I'm going to do
if they take him away from me.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.711
- Don't worry. We'll talk tomorrow.
- Thank you.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.617
- Bye.
- Saul, Saul, Saul! Over here!

18:07.687 --> 18:09.814
Look, kids!
We don't have to walk.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.948
Come on, kids.
Come on, kids.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.652
- Henry.
- Let's go. Watch your brother.

18:14.727 --> 18:18.128
No fingerprints on the windshield,
if you please.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.461
Try to keep the feet
off the seats, too, huh?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.558
All right.
Get on, sweetheart.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.297
- Feet on the floor, please.
- They are!

18:25.371 --> 18:27.635
- Me too.
- King Saul's Charter Service.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.301
- We make jail calls.

18:30.376 --> 18:33.903
I appreciate it, Saul.
We all do.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.971
You're a minister, you know.
You're not a social worker.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.482
I'll file a complaint.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.542
See you.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.521
All right, y'all.
Everybody sit down, now.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.819
Sit down, put your seat belts on.
Nobody gets carsick, do they?

18:45.892 --> 18:48.793
- I do!
- Just stick your head out that window!

18:48.995 --> 18:51.725
- Go on. It's not that cold out!
- Saul!

18:51.798 --> 18:54.665
What did they give you?
They give you eggs? Oh, no!

19:09.916 --> 19:13.511
Okay.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.520
Come on.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.492
Great.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.531
Lord, if You
are really up there...

19:26.599 --> 19:28.499
I need some help.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.771
- Henry?
- You again.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.211
- Yep.
- What do you want from me now?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.373
Uh, wait. I'm supposed
to ask you that question.

19:43.449 --> 19:46.714
Right now, all I want is
to put my key in the ignition...

19:46.786 --> 19:48.720
turn it and have it...

19:50.790 --> 19:53.156
- What else?

19:53.226 --> 19:56.525
Oh, I suppose you
think that you...

19:56.629 --> 19:59.063
Who are you?
Really?

19:59.131 --> 20:02.396
All right, but it might be best
if you don't tell anybody else.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.561
No. No.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.003
My name's Dudley,
as you remember...

20:07.073 --> 20:10.065
when I saw you
at the Youth Center, and...

20:10.142 --> 20:13.339
I'm an angel.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.346
I beg your pardon?

20:15.414 --> 20:17.541
An angel.
You know, like in the Bible?

20:19.352 --> 20:22.446
Of course you are!
The angel Dudley?

20:22.522 --> 20:25.855
- % Ding%
- That must have been that part
of the Bible that got lost.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.520
I knew you wouldn't understand.
I know you don't believe me.
It's hard, even for you.

20:29.595 --> 20:33.531
But angels cannot lie, Henry. We're not
allowed to. It's in the angel handbook.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.692
- Of course it is. No, that's okay.
- I'll show it to you.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.704
- No, I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna show you.
- That's okay. Okay, fine.

20:39.772 --> 20:44.209
Thanks for everything. Say hello
to the Big Guy and the Easter Bunny too.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.802
- Wait, wait, wait. Can I exp...
- It's freezing.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.643
- Let's get a cab.
- Can't afford one.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.013
Can I get in?

20:52.084 --> 20:55.178
Yes, it's cold out and...
Get in.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.449
- You've got a good heart, Henry.
- Come on.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.855
- You've got a good heart.
- Yeah, a good heart.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.095
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.167
Don't draw on the window.

21:09.235 --> 21:13.069
Oh, God.
I miss this place, Henry.

21:13.139 --> 21:16.336
I had some wonderful times
down here, I tell you.

21:16.409 --> 21:20.641
Oh, I'm not supposed
to go into how l...

21:20.713 --> 21:23.341
Ohh. The seat belt, please.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.977
But, as you can see,
I was cut down in my prime.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.078
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.214
Ever since then, Henry,
I've been up there...

21:31.290 --> 21:33.690
waitin' in line for a chance
to get sent back down here.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.693
- It's a long line, too, let me tell you.
- You don't say.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.752
Oh, I do say.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.993
You've got no idea what the competition
is like just to get sent down here.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.001
Everybody wants this job.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.333
I don't know why
He sent me, Henry, but I'm glad He did.

21:45.404 --> 21:48.339
- Yeah.
- And I'm going to do everything I can
to help you.

21:48.407 --> 21:52.036
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, I need to go over the rules,
if that's okay with you?

21:52.111 --> 21:56.207
- Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary.
- It'll only take a second, Henry.

21:56.282 --> 22:00.013
- Oh, all right.
- "Rule Number One: We can't do
anything you should be doing."

22:00.086 --> 22:03.920
That makes sense. If I'm doing it,
that'd be two of us, wouldn't it?

22:03.990 --> 22:08.222
Exactly. "Number Two: Everything you do
must be done of your own free will."

22:08.294 --> 22:12.526
- Now, that's a biggie.
- Tough, but fair. Are there many more?

22:12.598 --> 22:15.931
Finally, when I leave,
when the mission is accomplished,
you won't have any memory of me.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.027
That's my favorite.

22:18.104 --> 22:22.131
Okay, so I got my rules.
Where can I drop you?

22:22.208 --> 22:24.836
- Uh, how about right here?
- Good.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.447
- See you later, Henry.
- Um...

22:28.514 --> 22:31.449
Uh, ooh, ooh...

22:31.517 --> 22:34.748
Hold... Wait a minute.
Look. If you...

22:34.820 --> 22:38.620
If you really want to talk to me,
my office is always open.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.956
- Just make an appointment.
- Thank you.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.326
Okay.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.299
Feel it?

22:48.367 --> 22:52.667
Kinda like springtime and Mom's
home cooking all rolled into one?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.609
I don't feel a thing.

22:57.677 --> 23:01.340
You will.
Have faith.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.405
Good night, Henry.

23:03.482 --> 23:06.417
Good night.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.141
% Uh-huh, come on%

23:59.638 --> 24:02.163
Hold on, hold on.
I have an idea.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.903
I wanna try something new here.
I'm gonna separate the "nothing's."

24:04.977 --> 24:07.343
Sopranos first.
% And let nothing%

24:07.413 --> 24:09.938
Altos. % Nothing% % Nothing% Tenors,
okay? Gonna separate it, all right?

24:10.049 --> 24:13.075
Julia, we've always done it like this.
Why, all of a sudden, are you changing?

24:13.152 --> 24:16.747
Well, Mrs. Havergal, we're gonna do it
a little different tonight.

24:16.822 --> 24:19.882
- Is that all right with you?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.893
Let's try it.
One, two, three.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.826
- % And let nothing%
- % Nothing%

24:23.896 --> 24:25.591
% Nothing%

24:25.664 --> 24:27.598
% Separate you from His love% %

24:27.666 --> 24:30.396
- What do you think, Mrs. Havergal?
- Acceptable.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.403
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

24:32.471 --> 24:36.703
- % Put on the%
- % Whole armor of God%

24:49.355 --> 24:52.882
Mmm, now some of these ornaments
are old as Methuselah.

24:55.127 --> 24:59.723
Oh, honey, your years on the top
of the Christmas tree are over.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.892
Have you been smoking?

25:01.967 --> 25:05.095
No, no, I have not.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.867
Good TV tonight?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.568
What do you see when you look
at a place like this?

25:10.643 --> 25:12.702
I'll tell you what I see.
Sterling Acres.

25:12.778 --> 25:15.406
- The latest development miracle
from Hamilton Realty.
- Well, not anymore.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.972
I see 200 luxury apartments.

25:18.050 --> 25:21.577
Over here, a 24-hour health club,
right on the grounds.

25:21.654 --> 25:25.590
State-of-the-art security, designer
interiors you have to see to believe.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.218
The kind of homes that you deserve!

25:28.294 --> 25:30.592
And I know,
because I'm Joe Hamilton...

25:30.663 --> 25:33.359
and I care about the things
you care about.

25:33.465 --> 25:36.559
He's so oily,
you can fry chicken on that man's smile.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.296
Hmm.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.304
- He called here tonight.
- Huh?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.602
Said there's a meeting
at his office tomorrow at 11:00.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.836
He's got something
he wants to show you.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.902
Now, Henry,
I know it's none of my business...

25:48.013 --> 25:50.982
I'm glad you realize that,
Marguerite.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.644
I'll be in my office.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.687
- % The prize of your God%
- % And let nothing%

25:55.754 --> 25:57.517
- % And let nothing%
- % Nothing%

25:57.590 --> 26:00.582
- % Nothing%
- % Separate you from His love%

26:03.162 --> 26:06.723
- % To the Savior%

26:06.832 --> 26:10.324
- % The Lord%

26:10.402 --> 26:12.927
- What's goin' on?
- It's not me.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.805
"Down the chimney St. Nicholas
came down." What's that?

26:17.877 --> 26:22.507
% Put off your former conversation
Put on the glorious light%

26:24.683 --> 26:28.119
- It's the boiler!
- Don't forget your coats.

26:37.897 --> 26:42.664
Need to be now.
This is all I need.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.363
Come on. Careful.
Be careful.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.873
Julia, get everyone
out of the building.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.000
Come on, hurry, hurry.
Henry! The boiler!

26:51.076 --> 26:55.342
- Yeah, I know it.
- Button up, button up.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.144
What do you need?
Do you need anything?

27:00.452 --> 27:02.317
Careful, Mrs. Havergal.

27:02.388 --> 27:05.721
- You've got the devil
in that basement there.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.316
I know, I know.
Don't slip. I got it.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.022
Careful, children, careful.

27:11.096 --> 27:14.031
Oh, no, no!

27:14.099 --> 27:15.999
Look at this.

27:18.637 --> 27:23.040
Aww. Oh, no.

27:23.108 --> 27:26.635
You could have given us
one more winter.

27:30.115 --> 27:32.948
- Is it open?
- Yes, Jeremiah. I left it open.

27:33.018 --> 27:35.543
- Okay? All right. Sleep well.
- Okay.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.555
Good night, Mommy.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.523
What a night.

27:39.625 --> 27:42.219
I don't even want
to think about tomorrow...

27:42.294 --> 27:46.060
between the boiler and Hakim leaving.

27:46.131 --> 27:49.396
Now, why... why are they
gonna send that boy...

27:49.468 --> 27:51.732
to a foster home so far away?

27:51.804 --> 27:53.738
I knew I should have called...

27:53.806 --> 27:56.206
Honey, you called half
the agencies in the state.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.243
I know, I know.

27:59.311 --> 28:02.041
But maybe the answer
was in the other half.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.580
I'm losing them, Julia.

28:08.654 --> 28:13.387
One by one.
Hakim, Saul, Billy...

28:13.459 --> 28:16.087
the youth center.

28:16.161 --> 28:19.995
I know it's my fault,
but I just can't seem...

28:20.065 --> 28:24.001
- You know, honey,
I had some thoughts on...
- Can we do this in the morning?

28:24.069 --> 28:26.333
'Cause I'm beat.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.409
Yeah, the morning's fine.

28:34.179 --> 28:37.148
Good night, Julia.

28:47.092 --> 28:50.186
Yoo-hoo! Mornin'!

28:50.262 --> 28:52.560
Whoo!
I brought the mail in.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.134
Anybody wanna open it?

28:57.202 --> 29:00.933
Oh. Well, I'll just
take my coat off...

29:01.006 --> 29:03.338
and bring it on
into the office, then.

29:03.409 --> 29:07.641
Look, I know things have been tough
around here lately, and that's my fault.

29:07.713 --> 29:09.977
But everything is gonna be all right.

29:10.049 --> 29:14.213
- I'm comin'! Ooh! I got it!

29:14.286 --> 29:16.447
Hello? Who?

29:16.555 --> 29:18.989
- Mm-hmm.
- If only saying it made it all right.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.720
- Yeah.
- You see? If you'd listened,
you'd have heard an apology.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.625
Not a big one, but a start.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.788
- Uh-huh.
- No, what I heard is a man saying...

29:25.864 --> 29:29.163
"How can I deal with this fast enough,
then get on with the rest of my day?"

29:29.234 --> 29:32.465
- You see, that's not fair.
- Oh, it's not fair?

29:32.538 --> 29:35.029
Girl, I'm trying to listen!

29:35.107 --> 29:38.702
Yeah, I'll give him
the message. Uh-huh.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.177
We've got to stop talking around Mama.
She knows too much of our business.

29:41.246 --> 29:45.205
That was Anna Eldridge. Billy's
bail hearing's been scheduled for 9:30.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.913
9:30! We'll finish this later, honey.
I promise.

29:48.987 --> 29:51.217
- Are you coming home after?
- Not right after.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.850
- I have to be somewhere at 11:00.
- Joe Hamilton.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.259
- Do you mind?
- Oh, Henry.

29:57.329 --> 30:00.730
Do I look like I mind?

30:07.239 --> 30:09.673
You ready to talk about this,
little girl?

30:09.775 --> 30:13.404
I don't know what you mean, Mama.
I think things are looking up for us.

30:13.479 --> 30:17.381
Mmm-hmm.
There goes that behind again.

30:17.449 --> 30:21.215
% I know He's keeping me alive%

30:21.286 --> 30:23.049
% Keeping me alive%

30:23.122 --> 30:25.056
% Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum%

30:25.124 --> 30:28.093
% He's all over me%

30:28.160 --> 30:29.388
% And He's keepin' me alive%

30:29.461 --> 30:32.555
% Oooh, yeah
He's all over me%

30:32.631 --> 30:35.395
% Ooh-ooh, keepin' me alive%

30:35.467 --> 30:38.561
% And He's all over me%

30:38.637 --> 30:41.105
% Ooh-ooh, keepin'... % %

30:41.173 --> 30:43.869
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.240
I didn't hear you come in!
You waitin' for the pastor?

30:46.311 --> 30:48.575
Yes, yes.
My name's Dudley.

30:48.647 --> 30:51.115
- Beverly.
- How are you?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.879
- I'm the pastor's secretary.
- Pleasure to meet you.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.944
You just missed him.
He went to court.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.287
- These your children?
- Yeah, that's them.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.293
Oh, they're beautiful.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.091
Where was your husband?
Taking the picture?

31:05.164 --> 31:09.794
Mm-hmm.
Then he took the car and the waitress
at the diner and moved to Cleveland.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.235
- Sorry to hear that.
- You have any children?

31:13.305 --> 31:18.766
No, no. Never had a chance
to settle down. I wanted to.

31:18.844 --> 31:23.281
- You smell wonderful.
What do you call that?

31:23.348 --> 31:24.838
Soap.

31:24.917 --> 31:27.613
I haven't smelled a woman
in such a long time.

31:27.686 --> 31:31.281
I'll get you a bar for Christmas.
Do you have an appointment?

31:31.356 --> 31:35.122
Uh, no, not exactly.
I was...

31:35.194 --> 31:38.630
sent to help the reverend,
like an assistant.

31:38.697 --> 31:42.292
Assistant? I haven't
heard anything about no...

31:42.367 --> 31:44.426
Oh, my Lord!
Am I gettin' fired?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.596
No, no, no.
It's just temporary.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.139
Temporary! I ain't heard
nothing about no temporary!

31:49.208 --> 31:51.301
- Well, there's nothing... Uh, look.
- Oh, God.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.709
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Coffee!
You made coffee on that machine?

31:54.780 --> 31:58.307
I've been trying for six weeks
to figure out that machine!

31:58.383 --> 32:00.817
My babies need new glasses,
and I'm out of a job!

32:00.886 --> 32:03.184
Look, mister, I have kids.
They're growin' like weeds.

32:03.255 --> 32:06.315
And if you think I get a penny from that
man, you got another thought comin'!

32:06.391 --> 32:08.518
I can't take this!
Bein' fired!

32:08.594 --> 32:10.585
Take it easy.
There's nothing to worry about. Here.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.130
Oooh! Oooh!

32:13.198 --> 32:15.496
Look at you.
You're crying.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.831
Here, blow, blow.

32:17.903 --> 32:20.667
Oh. I knew that.

32:20.739 --> 32:24.505
Your Honor, my client,
Billy Eldridge...

32:24.576 --> 32:26.635
was sent by his mother
to return a video rental...

32:26.712 --> 32:29.340
It's all here, Miss Chattan.

32:29.414 --> 32:32.042
Well, the Reverend Biggs
is present in the courtroom...

32:32.117 --> 32:34.585
and he is willing to post bail.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.679
This is a serious felony.
Bail is set at $ 25,000.

32:37.756 --> 32:41.351
- Your Honor, I have evidence...
- May I address the court?

32:41.426 --> 32:44.156
I'm turning it over
for grand jury action. Next case.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.197
We love you, Billy.
He didn't do it.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.926
Clear the court.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.662
$25,000!
What am I gonna do?

32:50.736 --> 32:53.500
- Would you clear the court?
- I'll take care of it.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.598
Next case.
I said, next case!

32:56.675 --> 32:59.644
Pending 802, Harley Williamson.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.530
- You could hide.
- Mm-mm.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.628
- Take this. I'll bring him right out.
- Sure. No problem.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.843
Here.
They might starve you.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.482
Thanks.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.822
Okay, they've got everything.
All ready to go.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.055
Hey, guys!

33:51.129 --> 33:53.825
Hakim, you remember
Robbie, don't you?

33:53.899 --> 33:55.833
Hakim gets to ride
in the train today.

33:55.901 --> 33:59.894
Wow. A train ride.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.962
We're running a little late.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.304
Okay.

34:04.376 --> 34:08.505
Take care of yourself, okay?
See you soon. Say good-bye, Jer.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.275
Bye.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.681
Take care.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.811
Bye, Hakim.
We'll miss you.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.685
Hold on, baby.
It's cold out here.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.496
Who will I tell my secrets to?

34:31.570 --> 34:34.266
Well, you can phone Hakim
sometimes, okay?

34:34.339 --> 34:37.570
And Mommy'll teach you how to write,
so you can send him letters.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.556
Bye.

35:12.077 --> 35:15.376
I know You have
a master plan, but...

35:15.447 --> 35:18.245
sometimes You're just
a little tough to figure.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.353
Jeremiah.

35:22.421 --> 35:25.982
- Jeremiah.
- It's not fair!

35:26.057 --> 35:28.491
Hakim left.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.796
Julia.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.440
This is Dudley,
the reverend's new assistant.

35:43.508 --> 35:47.444
Assistant? He wrote to the church
council months ago for extra help.

35:47.512 --> 35:50.174
Well, the extra help is here.

35:50.248 --> 35:53.342
Oooooh.

35:53.418 --> 35:57.013
But he didn't say anything about getting
a response. Who sent you, exactly?

35:57.088 --> 35:59.522
Uh, the, uh...

35:59.591 --> 36:01.889
The Top Man himself,
Mrs. Biggs.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.894
- Julia.
- Julia.

36:06.131 --> 36:09.362
And this is Julia's mother,
Mrs. Coleman.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.402
Of course it is.

36:11.470 --> 36:16.066
Well, it's obvious where
Julia's beauty comes from.

36:16.141 --> 36:20.237
Oh. And me with my hair
lookin' like this.

36:20.312 --> 36:23.042
- Oh, no. It looks magnificent.
- Why, thank you.

36:23.114 --> 36:26.413
- Well, Mr., um...
- You can call me Dudley.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.749
- Dudley. You're very welcome here.
- Thank you.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.220
Excuse us.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.626
What are you doing?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.060
Now, that's what I call good-lookin'!

36:38.129 --> 36:40.427
Your daddy used to look
like that back in 19...

36:40.499 --> 36:43.900
Ma, ma, ma.
I've heard it 100 times.

36:43.969 --> 36:48.668
Yeah, well, maybe now,
with him around, you'll have time to
deal with some of your own problems.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.674
The Good Lord's
the only one who can do that.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.074
- Honey, you don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do.

36:53.144 --> 36:55.078
Ma!

36:55.146 --> 36:58.582
I was gonna go over
by the window, Julia.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.049
There's too many rules
in this house.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.427
You're the man in the street...

37:14.499 --> 37:17.468
and in the snow and...

37:17.536 --> 37:19.766
My name's Dudley.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.136
I'm here to help your father.

37:22.207 --> 37:26.041
- I'm Jeremiah.
- It's nice to meet you, Jeremiah.

37:26.111 --> 37:28.341
You've got a real nice room here.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.971
Thank you.

37:30.048 --> 37:33.449
Wow, you've got a lot
of neat stuff in here.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.611
And what is this?

37:35.687 --> 37:38.850
My toy ambulance is broken.

37:38.924 --> 37:42.325
The battery got stole,
and the lights don't work anymore.

37:42.394 --> 37:46.888
Is that right?
I'll see what I can do here.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.396
It never had a siren!

37:55.040 --> 37:56.974
Never had a siren?

37:57.042 --> 37:58.942
No.

38:04.716 --> 38:10.177
You look sad there, Jeremiah.
Have you been crying?

38:10.255 --> 38:12.849
Yes.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.950
I'm sorry
about your friend, Hakim.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.994
What if I told you...

38:21.066 --> 38:23.330
that he's not really gone?

38:23.401 --> 38:27.337
Hakim?
Did he run away and come back?

38:27.405 --> 38:31.808
- No, he never left.
- Yes, he did. I saw him go.

38:34.813 --> 38:39.079
Well, you know, my mother...

38:39.150 --> 38:41.641
once lost someone
who was very dear to her.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.119
He wasn't as young as Hakim,
but he was...

38:44.189 --> 38:46.623
too young, just the same.

38:46.691 --> 38:50.787
And she would always do something
that seemed to make her feel better.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.296
- You want to try it?
- Yeah.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.697
All right, close your eyes.

38:55.767 --> 39:00.466
Do you remember
playing in the snow with Hakim?

39:02.540 --> 39:05.976
Do you remember
what his laugh sounded like?

39:06.044 --> 39:08.376
Yes.

39:08.446 --> 39:12.382
Do you remember
what he looked like catching a ball?

39:12.450 --> 39:18.150
He never caught the ball in his life.
But I remember.

39:18.223 --> 39:22.125
That's because when God
takes someone away from us...

39:22.193 --> 39:26.721
He leaves what's most important
about that person with us.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.891
Right here in our hearts.

39:28.967 --> 39:33.063
Yeah, but I still miss him.

39:33.138 --> 39:36.005
Well, she still misses him too.

39:36.074 --> 39:38.838
Are you all right?

39:38.910 --> 39:42.710
Maybe you should close your eyes.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.912
Mommy says I can write to him.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.457
- Do you know how to spell his name?
- No.

39:53.525 --> 39:56.187
- You want to learn? All right.
- Yeah!

39:56.261 --> 39:59.526
- Hakim starts with an "H."
- And ends with "akim."

39:59.597 --> 40:02.725
- There you go. Perfect.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.736
Wow!

40:09.040 --> 40:12.203
Fishies in a TV.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.529
Windows.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.573
Henry?

40:52.650 --> 40:55.983
I know I said
make an appointment...

40:56.054 --> 40:59.421
but I didn't say anything
about filling out any form.

41:01.426 --> 41:05.487
Beverly!
Beverly, I need you.

41:05.563 --> 41:10.125
I gave her the day off to do
some Christmas shopping, Henry.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.334
You gave my secretary the day...

41:14.405 --> 41:16.965
Yes, she needed some time off
to be with her children...

41:17.075 --> 41:20.010
and I needed time to do my job with you.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.104
- What job? What are you doing here?
- Henry, Henry, Henry!

41:23.181 --> 41:25.308
How many times I got to tell you?

41:25.416 --> 41:28.442
I'm here in answer to your request
for help. And Julia's.

41:28.520 --> 41:32.650
You can forget about the boiler.
You got more important problem...

41:32.757 --> 41:34.691
Ah, here she is now.

41:34.759 --> 41:37.023
- Henry?
- Wha...

41:37.095 --> 41:39.620
Whoo! Lord have mercy!

41:39.697 --> 41:44.634
Honey, remind me the next time I pay
a visit, I wanna get paid! Okay?

41:44.702 --> 41:47.034
- Hi, Dudley.

41:47.105 --> 41:51.599
- Julia.
- Dudley. D-U-D-L-E-Y.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.201
- Perfect.
- Very good.

41:54.279 --> 41:57.874
- Poi-fect. Poi-fect.
- What happened with Billy Eldridge?

41:57.949 --> 42:00.747
Uh, uh, the judge
set the bail at $25,000.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.788
- Henry, that child's still in jail?
- Julia, I did what I could!

42:06.858 --> 42:09.326
Come on, sweetie.
We have a nativity play to rehearse.

42:09.394 --> 42:11.487
You can't rehearse.
It's freezing in there.

42:11.563 --> 42:14.157
Henry, I'll be chasing 15 kids all day.
I don't think I'll get cold.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.894
And after we're through, you're
taking your son shopping, remember?

42:16.968 --> 42:18.401
- Henry.
- Huh?

42:18.469 --> 42:21.097
Your wife's talking to you.

42:21.172 --> 42:25.506
Oh, yes, uh, uh...
Hanley's, 1:00. 1:00?

42:25.577 --> 42:27.636
Spell Hakim for me, baby.

42:27.712 --> 42:32.445
M-l-K-A-H.
Dudley's teaching me to spell backwards.

42:32.517 --> 42:36.078
Maybe he can teach Daddy
how to be on time.

42:36.154 --> 42:41.091
These are perfect. Beverly never
typed a perfect letter in her life.

42:41.159 --> 42:43.753
Yes, I did those myself,
once I figured out that fish typewriter.

42:43.828 --> 42:45.762
Let's get this straight, Dud.

42:45.830 --> 42:49.129
I do not appreciate some stranger
coming into my office...

42:49.200 --> 42:52.636
Angels are hardly strangers, Henry.
And don't call me "Dud."

42:52.704 --> 42:55.366
Julia, hold on! Wait for me!

42:55.440 --> 42:59.536
Excuse me, Mother, not now. I'm having
a little meeting. You understand.

42:59.611 --> 43:01.476
- Bye, Marguerite!
- Bye, Dudley!

43:01.546 --> 43:03.537
- Mama, come on!
- Start that rehearsal!

43:03.615 --> 43:07.779
You are not going around telling
my family this ridiculous story...

43:07.852 --> 43:10.821
No, of course not.
They think the church council sent me.

43:10.889 --> 43:12.857
The church council!

43:12.924 --> 43:16.621
Why don't we continue this on our way
to the meeting with Joe Hamilton?

43:16.694 --> 43:18.958
The meeting.

43:19.030 --> 43:21.624
- So, which floor is he on?
- I'm not telling.

43:21.699 --> 43:23.667
- Henry, what's the floor?
- Go away.

43:23.735 --> 43:27.796
- You asked for help.
- Not from you. I don't need you
in here, out there or anywhere.

43:29.407 --> 43:33.343
You didn't have to let the doors close
on me downstairs, Henry. That was cold.

43:33.411 --> 43:35.504
Well, I figured
you'd just fly up.

43:35.580 --> 43:39.346
You know, if you're really
a you-know-what, where are your wings?

43:39.417 --> 43:41.510
You're caught up in stereotypes, Henry.
That's your problem.

43:41.586 --> 43:43.645
Hello, Reverend.

43:43.721 --> 43:46.815
That's a beautiful dress you have on.
Just magnificent.

43:46.891 --> 43:48.825
Why, thank you.

43:48.893 --> 43:51.691
- You're very welcome.

43:51.763 --> 43:54.197
Is Mr. Hamilton inside?

43:54.265 --> 43:58.167
Oh, he's taping another TV commercial,
but you can wait in his office.

43:58.236 --> 44:00.670
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

44:03.441 --> 44:06.239
Hamilton Realty.
Hi, Amy.

44:06.311 --> 44:10.077
You know that old dress
from Mom's closet? It's back in style.

44:11.416 --> 44:13.509
"That's a lovely dress!"

44:13.584 --> 44:16.314
It was a lovely dress. I mean,
you gotta admit, it was a lovely dress.

44:16.421 --> 44:18.685
What kind of angel talks like that?

44:18.756 --> 44:21.190
The kind of angel
that has good taste.

44:21.259 --> 44:23.352
Well, you're still
not going in here.

44:23.428 --> 44:26.192
Henry, I'm like this with the creator
of the entire universe.

44:26.264 --> 44:29.927
- Now, you don't think a little door's
gonna stop me, do you?
- Yes.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.868
How? How?

44:32.937 --> 44:35.167
Rule Number Two.

44:38.109 --> 44:42.603
All right, fine, Henry. Can't make you
do anything you don't wanna do.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.513
That's right! That's right!
I always liked that rule!

44:47.118 --> 44:50.110
Did you like that smile?
I tilted my head to the side.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.156
I loved it.

44:52.223 --> 44:54.555
- Henry Biggs.
- Joe Hamilton.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.718
- How are you doing? Julia's good?
- She's very good.

44:56.794 --> 44:58.887
- Uh, Henry, this is Debbie Page.

44:58.963 --> 45:01.488
- Hi.
- She's the station manager over at WRKO.

45:01.566 --> 45:03.898
They're televising your Christmas sermon
this year.

45:03.968 --> 45:06.766
We need to get your text
for the TelePrompTer, Reverend.

45:06.838 --> 45:10.239
- I'm working on it.
- Later, Debbie. Come on.
Let's see the guys.

45:10.308 --> 45:12.242
- Wait 'til you see where
you're gonna move to, Henry.
- What?

45:12.310 --> 45:15.336
A planned community.
Your son could ride his bike to school.

45:19.917 --> 45:21.851
- Mary?
- Henry!

45:21.919 --> 45:24.444
Osbert?
What are you doing here?

45:24.522 --> 45:28.253
Well, I, we, um... We came to check out,
the same as you, Henry!

45:28.326 --> 45:30.351
Saul.

45:30.428 --> 45:33.920
Uh, listen to the man, Henry.
We think it makes sense.

45:33.998 --> 45:35.932
Well, of course
it makes sense.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.161
That's what it's gonna look like
when it's finished.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.670
- What do you think, Henry?
- Isn't that nice?

45:40.738 --> 45:43.502
It's a new city landmark.
It's a whole new neighborhood.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.804
A different clientele, so to speak.

45:45.877 --> 45:47.936
I'm hoping, with everyone here,
we can once and for all...

45:48.012 --> 45:51.243
persuade you to move
into the new world, Henry.

45:51.349 --> 45:54.341
Well, all we need is
a boiler that works...

45:54.419 --> 45:57.115
and we'll be fine
in the world that we're in.

45:59.190 --> 46:03.718
New boiler. Henry, look at this.
Day care facilities.

46:03.795 --> 46:05.888
We need that.

46:05.963 --> 46:08.124
We could sure use that.

46:08.199 --> 46:09.962
Senior citizens' club.

46:10.034 --> 46:12.195
- That's much better than ours.
- Mm-hmm.

46:12.270 --> 46:15.000
- What I'm offering you here, Henry...
- Well, it is.

46:15.073 --> 46:18.634
TV cameras and lighting
built right in.

46:18.709 --> 46:21.701
- Look at that!
- It's a pulpit to preach to the world!

46:21.779 --> 46:23.679
It's beautiful!

46:23.748 --> 46:26.410
All you have to say is,
"I'll do it."

46:30.221 --> 46:32.655
Say yeah. Say yeah.

46:32.723 --> 46:36.250
All right.

46:36.327 --> 46:39.558
Look, say yes,
and I'll throw in that new boiler.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.497
I'll stop St. Matt's
from freezing over Christmas...

46:42.567 --> 46:45.536
if that's the price
I have to pay to get you.

46:45.603 --> 46:50.336
And if I accept,
what price am I paying?

46:50.408 --> 46:54.504
Henry, what you see there is
the answer to all your problems.

46:54.579 --> 46:56.513
Amen.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.640
Isn't it?

46:58.850 --> 47:02.718
- I need my Magi. The Magi's entrance.

47:02.787 --> 47:06.188
- What does the sheep say in this play?
- Baaaa!

47:06.257 --> 47:08.191
Ah. Mmm.

47:08.259 --> 47:10.489
Does everybody know their parts?
You know your parts?

47:10.595 --> 47:14.622
- What's my part?
- What's your part? You're a camel.

47:14.699 --> 47:16.633
- I need my shepherds.
- I'm a shepherd.

47:16.701 --> 47:19.465
- Come here. You two, over here.
- I'm the angel.

47:19.537 --> 47:22.700
- In there. Come on.

47:22.773 --> 47:25.901
Kick it, Mrs. Havergal.
Let's do this.

47:25.977 --> 47:28.775
Jeremiah, get in your place, please.

47:31.516 --> 47:35.247
% Mommies and Daddies%

47:35.319 --> 47:39.312
% Always believe%

47:39.390 --> 47:44.657
% That their little angels%

47:44.729 --> 47:48.722
- % Are special indeed%
- Smile, Michael.

47:48.799 --> 47:51.996
- % And you could grow up%
- % Ooooh%

47:52.069 --> 47:57.837
- % Oooh%
- % To be anything%

47:57.909 --> 48:02.312
% But who would imagine%

48:02.380 --> 48:05.008
% A king%

48:05.082 --> 48:07.016
Everybody.

48:07.084 --> 48:10.247
% It was so clear%

48:10.321 --> 48:13.256
% When the Wise Men arrived%

48:13.324 --> 48:16.259
- Wait. Donkeys on this side.
- % And the angels%

48:16.327 --> 48:18.591
- Sorry.
- % Were singing%

48:18.663 --> 48:22.030
% Your name%

48:22.099 --> 48:26.433
% That the world
would be different%

48:26.504 --> 48:30.201
% 'Cause you were alive%

48:30.274 --> 48:33.903
% That's when heaven
stood still%

48:34.011 --> 48:37.276
% To proclaim%

48:37.348 --> 48:39.646
Jessica.

48:39.717 --> 48:43.118
- % One day an angel%
- Take your baby. Smile.

48:43.187 --> 48:47.783
% Said quietly%

48:47.858 --> 48:51.021
% That soon he would bring%

48:51.095 --> 48:55.156
% Something special to me%

48:55.233 --> 48:59.897
- % Oooh%
- % And of all of the wonderful%

48:59.971 --> 49:04.999
- % Oooh%
- % Gifts he could bring%

49:05.076 --> 49:09.308
% Who would imagine%

49:09.380 --> 49:15.808
% A king% %

49:15.886 --> 49:19.413
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

49:21.892 --> 49:23.826
- Again.
- All right.

49:23.894 --> 49:26.692
You take this one solo, okay?

49:26.764 --> 49:29.324
- Okay?
- Comet's swingin'!

49:29.400 --> 49:31.334
- Ooh, look at that.
- Beautiful, isn't it?

49:31.402 --> 49:34.132
Uh-huh.
Sure is.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.998
Go in and try it on.

49:39.744 --> 49:42.679
We're supposed to be shopping
for Henry, remember?

49:42.747 --> 49:47.207
You with that nightgown on is
all the gift Henry would want.

49:47.285 --> 49:49.549
- Trust me.
- A gift from Jeremiah.

49:49.620 --> 49:53.021
- Oh. Ho, ho.
- Mmm.

49:54.592 --> 49:57.117
So how long do you think
he's gonna be with that snake?

49:57.194 --> 49:59.526
He'll be along soon.

49:59.597 --> 50:02.191
How'd you two meet, anyway?

50:02.266 --> 50:06.703
Hmm. We were in adjoining
strollers, and, uh...

50:06.804 --> 50:10.205
and one day I took his pacifier,
and he made a really big noise about it.

50:10.274 --> 50:12.367
Who wouldn't?

50:12.443 --> 50:15.003
You know, when he was about ten,
he started wearing suits to school.

50:15.112 --> 50:17.376
- What?
- Trying to impress me.

50:17.448 --> 50:19.882
Obviously, it worked.

50:19.950 --> 50:22.714
He'd walk me home...

50:22.787 --> 50:25.551
and I always thought he was cuter
without his glasses, so...

50:25.623 --> 50:27.784
one day he took them off for me.

50:27.858 --> 50:31.055
And he slipped on the ice,
and fell right on his fanny.

50:31.128 --> 50:33.892
Sounds like love to me.

50:33.964 --> 50:37.661
Daddy said we were born friends.

50:39.970 --> 50:42.234
He did a lot for Henry,
your father.

50:42.306 --> 50:44.774
He was the best.

50:44.842 --> 50:47.504
Mommy.
Enough!

50:49.914 --> 50:53.111
- Is it good, Dudley?
- Mm-hmm. Great.

50:53.184 --> 50:56.312
How is your food, Jeremiah?
Mmmmm.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.651
- Julia.
- Henry.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.988
Ah, Jeremiah.
Dudley!

51:02.059 --> 51:05.859
- Henry.
- Okay, Jer. Let's go shopping.

51:05.930 --> 51:08.364
- Wait, honey. What happened?
- I'll tell you later.

51:08.432 --> 51:10.332
- Come on. Come on.
- Henry, it is later.

51:10.401 --> 51:12.995
It's about an hour later
than when you were supposed to be here.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.163
- Now, what happened?
- It's a long story.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.264
You know, you and Julia need to talk.

51:17.341 --> 51:21.641
I can take Jeremiah shopping.
I'm an excellent gift consultant.

51:21.712 --> 51:23.703
Yes, Dudley.
I want Dudley.

51:23.781 --> 51:26.147
Wait a minute.
I wanted to take him shopping.

51:26.217 --> 51:28.617
You two have more important
things to talk about.

51:28.686 --> 51:30.779
- Dud-ley! Dud-ley! Dud-ley!
- Jeremiah.

51:30.855 --> 51:34.120
We'll be right across the street
at the toy store. Okay?

51:34.191 --> 51:36.182
- Julia! Julia!
- Dud-ley!

51:36.260 --> 51:39.889
- Jere-miah! Put your hat on.
- Dud-ley! Dud-ley!

51:39.964 --> 51:42.398
- So, who are we shopping for?
- Grandma.

51:42.466 --> 51:44.866
- Any idea what she wants?
- A new ashtray.

51:44.935 --> 51:48.302
- Mom took all her old ones.
- Let's get something for Hakim.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.135
So, what happened?

51:54.545 --> 51:57.605
Julia.

52:00.551 --> 52:03.145
L...

52:03.220 --> 52:06.986
I've decided to accept
Joe Hamilton's offer.

52:08.959 --> 52:11.689
Julia, did you hear me?

52:11.762 --> 52:15.858
- I heard you. I just can't
believe what I've heard.
- Then let me explain.

52:15.933 --> 52:18.026
Excuse me.
Can I get you anything?

52:18.102 --> 52:20.127
Oh, no, no, no.
No, thank you.

52:20.237 --> 52:23.001
Okay.

52:23.073 --> 52:27.009
Listen, Saul was there,
Mary Halford, Andy and Osbert.

52:27.077 --> 52:29.011
But what were they doing there?

52:29.079 --> 52:33.015
Every one of them was begging me,
arguing with me, blackmailing me.

52:33.083 --> 52:36.052
- Blackmail!
- They're gonna put in
a new boiler tomorrow.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.782
- Henry, he bought you for a boiler?
- Shh. Julia.

52:41.025 --> 52:44.517
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse us.
Of course not!

52:44.595 --> 52:47.223
- Oooooh...
- Julia, let me show you something.

52:47.298 --> 52:49.562
Julia, Julia...

52:49.633 --> 52:53.364
he is building the most beautiful church
you've ever seen.

52:53.437 --> 52:55.428
Look at that.
Day care center, youth center.

52:55.506 --> 52:58.031
Henry, he is building
a shrine to himself!

52:58.108 --> 53:01.976
Eight years, Julia.
And what do I have to show for it?

53:02.046 --> 53:06.710
So you give up our lives
without even talking to me, Henry?

53:06.784 --> 53:09.582
This solves all of our problems, Julia.
Why can't you see that?

53:09.653 --> 53:13.054
My father trusted you with St. Matt's.
How dare you walk out on it like this!

53:13.123 --> 53:15.648
All right, all right.
Your father was a saint, and I'm not!

53:15.726 --> 53:18.559
But I'm here, Julia, and he isn't.

53:21.966 --> 53:24.594
I'm sorry, Julia.

53:24.668 --> 53:27.068
Give me the car keys, Henry!

53:27.137 --> 53:29.765
Julia!

53:29.840 --> 53:32.331
- Julia, please sit down.
- Give me the keys, Henry.

53:32.409 --> 53:36.345
Would you kindly give her the keys?
I have customers sitting here.

53:36.413 --> 53:38.347
Sorry. Sorry.

53:38.415 --> 53:40.610
Julia, please listen to me.

53:40.684 --> 53:44.347
Henry, I can't.
I don't even know who you are anymore.

53:44.421 --> 53:46.651
Julia.

53:48.926 --> 53:51.451
Come on, Jeremiah.
We're leaving.

53:51.529 --> 53:53.520
I got Daddy's present.

53:53.597 --> 53:56.760
And I bought a fire engine for Hakim.

53:56.834 --> 53:58.768
It was on sale.

53:58.836 --> 54:01.805
Yes, that's wonderful, honey.
That's wonderful.

54:06.911 --> 54:10.938
All right. You're going to have
to support him now, Julia.

54:11.015 --> 54:13.950
You hear me?
Now is when he needs you most.

54:14.018 --> 54:16.612
Mama, I can't support what's wrong.

54:16.687 --> 54:19.918
Preachin' God's word is never wrong,
no matter where you do it from.

54:22.259 --> 54:25.251
He didn't even discuss it with me.

54:25.362 --> 54:28.126
Daddy would have never
made a decision like that
without discussing it with you.

54:28.198 --> 54:32.794
Sure he would. Your Daddy kept
things from me all the time.
Especially church business.

54:32.870 --> 54:35.236
Well, it was different
in those days.

54:35.306 --> 54:39.538
Those days!
Child, men ain't changed since Adam!

54:39.610 --> 54:44.206
And he gave up one of his own ribs,
just so he could have somebody
to keep things from!

54:48.986 --> 54:52.820
You know, gettin'angry
at a dead tree is not gonna help.

54:52.890 --> 54:56.326
Yeah, but it wouldn't look good
to punch out a pastor, either.

54:56.393 --> 55:00.193
No, you don't... you don't...
you don't mean that...

55:00.264 --> 55:02.232
'Cause you know you love him.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.324
Yeah, he knows it, too.
That's the problem.

55:04.401 --> 55:07.768
He knows I'll always be there,
just like a pet.

55:07.838 --> 55:10.602
- Ouch!
- See? God doesn't like ugly.

55:10.674 --> 55:12.733
- Let me see.

55:15.579 --> 55:17.570
You ever had your palm read?

55:20.918 --> 55:23.478
Okay.

55:28.826 --> 55:32.762
I see a beautiful woman
with a good heart.

55:32.830 --> 55:37.767
Only has to open her eyes to realize
that everything she ever wanted...

55:37.835 --> 55:40.429
she already has.

55:40.504 --> 55:43.701
You didn't even look at my hand.

55:43.774 --> 55:46.504
But I held it.

55:46.577 --> 55:50.377
Do you see Henry and me?

55:50.447 --> 55:55.009
Hmmm... let's see.

55:55.085 --> 55:57.553
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Ohhh.

55:57.621 --> 55:59.885
Oh, it's so hot,
I had to let it go.

55:59.957 --> 56:02.391
You must be talking about my past.

56:02.459 --> 56:04.791
- Mrs. Biggs, you forgot this.
- Thanks.

56:04.862 --> 56:07.296
Every fire dies sometime,
Dudley.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.731
What do you do when you have to decide
if the memory of it is enough?

56:10.767 --> 56:13.201
- What do you do?
- Yeah.

56:13.270 --> 56:16.797
What you do is you... you go dancing,
that's what you do. You go out.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.671
- Dancing?
- Yes.

56:18.742 --> 56:23.042
You're gonna go dancing,
put on a beautiful dress,
make your husband break out the cologne.

56:23.113 --> 56:25.047
- Have you met my husband?
- That's right, I met him.

56:25.115 --> 56:28.175
- He hasn't taken me out in...
- Far too long. That's my point.

56:28.252 --> 56:32.348
But tonight's gonna be different.
Tonight you're gonna strike a match.

56:32.422 --> 56:36.722
No, not a match, a, a firecracker!
You'll see.

56:38.896 --> 56:43.799
You take your coat off, you go upstairs
and you take your wife out dancing.

56:43.867 --> 56:45.801
Can't do it.
Not tonight.

56:45.869 --> 56:48.861
Henry, you and Julia need this.

56:48.939 --> 56:52.841
Mr. Kingman needs his minister
with him at the hospital,
and the seniors need blankets.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.242
You're only one man, Henry.

56:55.312 --> 56:58.179
Things don't get fixed
waiting for the next guy to do it.

56:58.248 --> 57:00.409
- Including marriages.
- Dudley!

57:00.484 --> 57:02.850
Henry!

57:02.920 --> 57:05.582
You already told her,
didn't you?

57:05.656 --> 57:08.216
She's upstairs dressing right now...

57:08.292 --> 57:10.760
- and once again
I'm gonna look like the bad guy.
- Not if you go.

57:10.827 --> 57:13.261
- Dudley!
- What? I'm just trying to help you.

57:13.330 --> 57:15.594
You're just trying to help.

57:15.666 --> 57:18.362
All right, you can help...
by taking her.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.335
- Me?
- Yes, you.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.769
- You're missing the point, Henry.
- No, no.

57:22.839 --> 57:27.572
The point is...
Mr. Kingman won't wait.

57:27.644 --> 57:30.511
Now, you go, tell me all about it later.

57:30.581 --> 57:34.176
- And you make sure
you tell her I'm sorry.

57:34.251 --> 57:36.947
- Ohh, Henry.
- Good night.

57:37.020 --> 57:38.954
- Henry.
- Not too late.

57:39.022 --> 57:40.956
- Henry.
- And no drinking.

57:41.024 --> 57:44.892
It was not supposed
to go like this.

57:44.962 --> 57:47.123
Good night, Mommy.

57:47.197 --> 57:49.131
Okay, good night.

57:49.199 --> 57:51.861
Don't worry about us.
I'm gonna give 'em a hot bath...

57:51.935 --> 57:54.802
and then we're gonna play Monopoly...
for real money!

57:54.871 --> 57:56.304
Yea!

57:58.508 --> 58:00.442
How do I look?

58:00.510 --> 58:03.604
Oh! Oh, my!

58:03.680 --> 58:05.671
Henry?

58:07.351 --> 58:10.514
Henry? Henry?

58:13.890 --> 58:16.825
- Where's Henry?
- He said... He said he's sorry.

58:16.893 --> 58:21.455
- He's sorry?
- Yeah, he had to go.

58:21.531 --> 58:24.329
One of the congregation
is in the hospital. Mr. Kingman.

58:24.401 --> 58:28.167
Oh, yeah.
He's been sick a long time.

58:28.238 --> 58:31.036
I'll call his wife tomorrow.

58:33.744 --> 58:37.942
Look, Julia,
he suggested that I, uh...

58:38.015 --> 58:41.974
pinch-hit for him,
if that's okay with you.

58:43.920 --> 58:46.252
Hmm?

58:46.423 --> 58:49.688
Welcome to Jazzie's, folks. Come on in.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.694
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

58:51.762 --> 58:53.491
- My brother.

59:10.781 --> 59:12.772
Ahhh!

59:14.451 --> 59:18.444
Nice, huh? Dancing. Do you dance?
I bet you're a good dancer.

59:18.522 --> 59:21.548
It's been a long time.

59:21.625 --> 59:24.025
You want to dance?

59:24.094 --> 59:26.221
Why not?

59:26.296 --> 59:28.890
- All right.
- Give it a shot.

59:28.965 --> 59:32.867
- Bust a move. Right.
- Bust a move.

59:40.444 --> 59:44.380
It doesn't seem like we're dancing
right for this music, huh?

59:45.649 --> 59:48.641
Get down.

59:48.719 --> 59:53.383
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean.

59:53.457 --> 59:55.823
Yeah.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.933
Oh, my.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:08.402
Go, brother!
Ooh, hit it!

01:00:08.472 --> 01:00:11.407
- What's he doing?

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:17.169
Mmm!

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.414
Ooh.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:27.950
- What's that one?
- The Popeye.

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:30.254
- The Popeye. Okay.

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:33.524
- It's comin' back now.
- I guess.

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:38.625
Whoo! You get out
about as much as I do.

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:43.196
Less! Even less!

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:45.571
Oh, there we go!

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.611
- Oh, you're swimming.
- Yeah, backstroking.

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:55.412
- Jules!
- Bristloe!

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.477
- How you doin', sweet thing?
- Oh, my Lord!

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:01.649
- I thought you were in Paris.
- I was, but I've been back a while.

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.159
You and Henry don't
come by here much anymore.

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:07.321
Henry's been real busy.
But it's great to see you!

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:11.458
- You too! How you doin', sweet thing?
- Oh, I'm okay.

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:13.833
Dudley, Bristloe.
Bristloe, Dudley.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:17.396
- Oh, hey. How ya doin'?
- A pleasure, a pleasure.

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:21.501
If Henry hadn't helped me
with that plane ticket,
I never would've gotten to Paris.

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:23.842
I tell you,
I owe that man everything.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:26.007
- You should call him and tell him.
- I will.

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:28.346
Do that.
He'd love to hear from you.

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:32.013
Why don't we all
just sit down and visit?

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:34.682
Yeah.

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:41.864
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:45.026
So, Bristloe,
are you and Maxine still together?

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.126
- Oh, you better believe it.
- Oh, good.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:50.537
She still calls six times a day
to make sure I'm being a good boy.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:54.270
Fine woman, that Maxine.
You married, Dudley?

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:56.335
No, no.

01:01:56.413 --> 01:02:00.349
No, I've never been lucky enough
to meet someone like Maxine... or Julia.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.476
Ain't that the truth?

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.385
Used to be a time this little girl
could come by here every night.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.787
- Yeah? You used to come in here?
- Sure.

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:11.385
Henry proposed to me
right over there, in that booth.

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:14.225
- Get outta here! Right over there?
- That's right.

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.663
- Those were the good old days, huh?
- Sure were.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.201
- Couldn't squeeze a dime between 'em.
- Whew.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:21.635
She used to go on stage
and torch the place down.

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:24.503
Get outta here.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:28.806
Now she just sings for the Lord.
Not that that's bad.

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:31.143
No, no, no.
That's good.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:34.809
Let me tell you somethin'.
Ever want to know what lovin'
really sounds like...

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:37.752
- she's got that secret in her voice.
- Oh, Bristloe, please.

01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:40.722
Why don't you share
that secret with us, Julia?

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:44.692
- Come on, remind us.
- No. It's been years, a long time.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.924
- You still do it in B?
- No, no, Bristloe. I don't do it at all.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:50.592
Well, I'd like to know
what love really sounds like.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.227
- Well, that solves that problem.
- Bristloe.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:56.704
- I don't know the song.
- Don't want to hear another word.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:03:01.301
- I don't...
- We want to hear you sing.
You sang it for Henry.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.902
I should be going home.

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:07.844
- We're going to play this in B.
Just follow me, okay?
- Okay.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:11.513
- Follow him, guys.
- You go out there. Go on. Yeah.

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:14.785
- Go on, sing it for Henry.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:24.591
No. No.

01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:30.138
Here we go.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:38.305
% I believe in you and me%

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:42.317
% I believe that we will be%

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:47.118
% In love eternally%

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:51.627
% Well, as far as I can see%

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:54.289
% You will always be%

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:57.731
% The one%

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:02.627
% For me%

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:06.472
% Oh, yes, you will%

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:10.309
% I believe in dreams again%

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:15.317
% I believe that love
will never end%

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:19.185
% And like the river finds%

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:22.281
% The sea%

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:26.352
% I was lost%

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:31.366
% Now I'm free%

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:35.200
% 'Cause I believe in you%

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:38.968
% And me, oh, oh my%

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:43.342
% Well, maybe I'm a fool%

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:47.213
% To feel the way I do%

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:51.720
% But I would play
the fool forever%

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:58.057
% Just to be
with you forever%

01:04:58.128 --> 01:05:02.064
% I believe in miracles%

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:07.126
% And love's a miracle%

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:11.003
% And yes, baby
you're a dream%

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:14.703
% Come true, ohhh%

01:05:14.778 --> 01:05:18.236
% I was lost%

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:22.648
% Now I'm free%

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:25.552
% Oh, darling, I believe%

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:30.423
% In you and me%

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:34.862
% See, I was lost%

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:40.267
% Now I'm free%

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:44.670
% 'Cause I believe in you%

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:51.408
% And me%

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:56.282
% Oooh, yeah
Oh, yes, I do%

01:05:56.352 --> 01:06:00.186
% I believe in you and%

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:06.627
% Me% %

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:19.303
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:23.311
You're bad.

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:26.212
One for you.

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.716
One for me.

01:06:28.785 --> 01:06:30.844
And one for the tree.

01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:34.890
- Thank you.
- I got your Christmas present yesterday.

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:37.051
You did?
What'd you get?

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:40.119
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.562
What are you getting Mom for Christmas?

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:45.157
I don't know.
What do you think I should get her?

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:48.295
I think she'd like to go to bed.

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:52.240
Excuse me, young man?

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:56.074
She was looking at a nightie
in the store window with Dudley.

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:58.080
Was she now?

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:00.343
All right, come on, young man.
Sleep time.

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:03.510
Wait for your mama to get home,
you'll be too big for the bed.

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:07.682
Go get some more Vicks on your chest.
See if we can rid of that stuffy nose.

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.521
I think you were born
with a stuffy nose. Come on, here.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.687
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:21.203
Oh, thank you.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:24.138
- Have a good evening.
- Thank you.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.836
- Did you have a good time?
- Are you kidding?
I had a great time. You?

01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:30.778
I had a ball.
You're not such a bad dancer.

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.782
- I haven't had so much fun
in a long time.
- I did too.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.717
- I heard you singing.
- Yeah, I was about to get
up there with you.

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:39.619
- I'm so glad you didn't.
- % I believe in miracles%

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:43.147
- Shh! They're probably all asleep.
- Not all of us.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.888
- Henry.
- Dudley.

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:49.728
I guess I don't have to ask
if you had a... good time.

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:52.232
We did. We went to Jazzie’s.

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:55.738
Some of the old band
was there, and...

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:58.706
You've been at Jazzie's?

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:02.108
Yeah. Yeah.
Bristloe was there too.

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:05.170
- Henry, your wife got on stage.
- Oh, wait, wait.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.273
You went singing
at Jazzie's all night?

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:11.184
- You told me to take her out.
- Not to the place where I proposed!

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.714
Henry, we had fun.
Remember what that used to be?

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:18.420
But honey. Jazzie's?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:26.859
Well, maybe I sang at Jazzie’s because
I won't be singing in any Joe Hamilton
church, wherever that may be.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:30.667
- Thanks, Dudley.
- Good night, Julia.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:37.202
- She had a good time, Henry.
- Oh, really?

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.716
Yeah. Yeah.
She told me about how you proposed.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.809
- She showed me the booth.
- The booth?

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:47.151
I don't believe
this entire situation!

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:51.158
No, you don't.
That's your trouble right there.

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:54.890
You don't believe in much of anything
anymore, do you, Henry?

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:58.296
You don't believe in me.
You don't believe in yourself.

01:08:58.368 --> 01:09:00.962
You don't believe you can
make a difference anymore.

01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:04.063
You don't even believe
that Billy Eldridge is innocent.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.075
Billy... Of course I do.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.077
You don't sound
very convincing, Henry.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.170
I tried to help him before.

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.942
- Did you?
- Yes.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:16.179
And besides,
he doesn't even go to church.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:20.586
Have you tried looking him in the eye
and asking him to tell the truth?

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.682
No. You know why?

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:26.354
I guess I was just
too busy having fun.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:30.024
I guess that's your problem, Henry.
You're just too busy.

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:33.830
Your wife feels like
she's in a marriage by herself.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:37.770
Your son lost his best friend.
What are you doing about that, Henry?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.707
You don't have to listen to me.
You're right.

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.211
But you ought to listen to them.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:48.180
Come on, everybody.
Time to make the Christmas baskets.

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.848
Aren't you gonna help?

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.858
I miss Hakim.

01:10:00.096 --> 01:10:02.189
I know.

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:05.962
But a lot of people
are depending on us for those baskets.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.401
- What do you think?
- Okay, then.

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:10.462
All right?

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:18.379
Gym socks. Now, nothing says
"Merry Christmas" like gym socks.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.120
Ahh.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.325
Uh, Billy.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:33.226
Uh... here.

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:36.197
Thank you.

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:39.063
Billy, I need
to talk to you.

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:41.603
You're wasting your time,
you know that?

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:44.469
The grand jury's
about to indict me in there.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:49.577
You ever pray, son?

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.875
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:55.281
You're too hip for that.
All right. Okay.

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.945
- You play ball?
- Yeah.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:03.192
When you play basketball, don't you
hope that when you shoot the ball...

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.352
that the ball goes into the net?

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.760
Yeah.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:10.560
Well, that's all prayer is: Hope.

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:14.694
And helping to give people hope
is what I do.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:18.207
What's the point?
No one believes me anyway.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.970
Billy...

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:26.815
Look at me, son.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:31.178
Were you a part of this or not?

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:34.814
I swear, Rev,
it happened just like I said.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.826
I've messed up before,
but I'm telling you the truth.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:01.183
When was the last time
you said a prayer, Billy?

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.014
I don't know.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:08.682
Well, I think it's about
time you gave it a try.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:12.350
- What's the status of this case?
- Good morning, Judge!
Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:15.363
Reverend Biggs,
this is not a playground!

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:18.195
It's a court of law!
I don't have time...

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:22.533
I work for an even higher court,
Your Honor, and I'm finding the time.

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:25.802
- I came to tell you
Billy Eldridge is innocent.
- I have your word on that?

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.776
- What does it take for me to show you?
- Let him in.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:33.111
On his way to return a video,
he got $20 from an auto-teller.
There's a time on the receipt.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:36.879
- The victim identified him, Reverend.
The victim...

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:41.390
Saw him standing there, Your Honor,
and that's all Billy was doing.

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:44.893
There's a grand jury hearing
going on right down the hall...

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:48.795
but the D.A. Won't even present it
if you don't buy the evidence.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:52.232
- And you know there isn't any.
- Reverend, come here. Come here.

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:54.792
I appreciate you
wanting to help the boy.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:57.567
The young man, Your Honor,
helped himself.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.202
He shows up every day to his $4.25
an hour job at Sampson's Stationery...

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:04.371
a job he's held steady for two years...

01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:06.881
and he goes to school at night.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:10.407
He came to a crossroads
a long time ago, Your Honor.

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:13.478
And he chose the right path.
Now it's up to you...

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.252
to judge not his past,
but his future;

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:19.192
not his failures, but his dreams;

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:23.596
not his imperfections,
but his possibilities.

01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:25.099
Hallelujah!

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:30.601
% Hallelujah, hallelujah%

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:33.073
% Hallelujah%

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.906
- Is that Billy?
- % Hallelujah, hallelujah%

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:39.175
- It is!
- % Hallelujah% %

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.443
Mama, Mama, Billy's home!

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:44.213
- They're all waiting for you.
- Thanks a lot, Rev.

01:13:44.287 --> 01:13:47.120
- You're welcome, son.
- I prayed for you, Billy.

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.783
Hey, Jessica!
I missed you.

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:52.293
Come here, kids.
How y'all doin'?

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:54.955
- Good to see you, son.
- Where the boys at?

01:13:55.031 --> 01:13:57.090
Hey, bro, what's up?

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:59.100
God bless you, Pastor.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:01.102
You guys get in the house.

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.968
- Billy's home! Billy's home!
- Come on, Mom.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.975
- It's so good to see you.
Did they hurt you?
- No, they didn't hurt me.

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:09.307
Are you all right?
Are you hungry?

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:13.838
You're hungry. You're hungry.
Kids, get the good dishes out.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:16.180
Two points.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:22.390
He's doin' it better than you.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.825
I don't know, Dudley. I'm a mother.
I can't die like this.

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:28.989
Time out. My feet sore.
I want to watch.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.226
Okay, baby, you can watch.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.394
- Whoa!
- That was fun.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.098
- Whoa!
- Okay.

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:39.334
All right, you sit here.

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:42.571
- Okay.
- And Mommy'll be right
over there skating, okay?

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:46.206
Keep warm, and the cocoa man is going
to bring you something to drink, okay?

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:49.250
- Look out for Daddy.
- Hi, Lisa. Over here!

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.843
Come on, Julia.

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:56.855
- Mademoiselle.
- "Madame," please.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:00.692
- And nothing too fancy, you.
- Oui, Oui.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:03.288
% Who would've thought%

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:05.857
- % That I might feel like this%
- All right.

01:15:05.935 --> 01:15:08.199
- % Some kind of wonderful%
- You wait. I'll get better.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.830
% There's nothing quite comparable%

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.932
% The thing about it is%

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.446
- Bend your knees. You're a natural.

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:21.209
I told you I'd get better.
I wonder where Henry is.

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:24.377
This time of day?
Probably stuck in traffic.

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:27.388
- % I'm about to lose a fight%
- Oh, come on!

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.788
Where did this light come from?

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:33.295
- Damn! I don't believe this.
- % Spend every day with you%

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:36.024
% And I swear it brings me closer%

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:39.465
- % To my only reservation%

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:42.231
% Is you, my sweet temptation
baby%

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:47.335
- Mommy!
- Jeremiah!

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:49.640
Hi, baby.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.805
% I'm falling for you%

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.577
Here's your hot chocolate.
Your mama sent it.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:56.584
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:02.317
% I'm falling for you%

01:16:02.425 --> 01:16:05.019
% Who could imagine this%

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:07.585
% I'd find my happiness in%

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:09.927
% Someone I barely know%

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:12.900
% When I like to take it slow%

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.994
- Oh, I can't take this. What gives?
- % You're so different, boy%

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:18.973
% You're breaking all my rules%

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:21.839
- % But is it in your smile%
- Ohh! Relax!

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:24.072
- % That makes me feel the way I do%
- Come on! Change!

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:26.307
% I'm trying to live my life%

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.906
- % And I'm trying to live it right%

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:33.944

Oh, you were right, Mommy.

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:46.260
Mommy told me if things don't
turn out just the way you want,
you've still got to believe.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:49.195
And I kept believing,
and you were right, Mommy.

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:51.665
- Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:56.671
Hi, Ma.

01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:59.867
Shhh.
The movie's almost over.

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:02.843
I can help you with that.

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:05.847
- Oh, thank you.
- Madame.

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:08.213
All right, off with the boots.

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:18.993
Grandma's crying.

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:23.691
Yeah, baby, she cries
at these movies every Christmas.
She cries at "Jingle Bells."

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:37.575
Ohh! So skatin' was good, huh?

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:40.080
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah, it was okay.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.050
- It was nice. I had a good...
- It was a nice time.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:46.212
- It was great. It was nice, skating.
- Grandma.

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:48.256
Yeah, we had a good time.

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:50.383
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was great.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:53.895
- I laughed a lot.
- Oh, my Lord!

01:18:57.099 --> 01:19:00.762

- Yeah, I'm gonna...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:12.975
Uh, go and do some work in the office.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:19.353
- Oh, my Lord.
- Ma, you said that already.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:23.050
And I'm gonna say it again.
Oh, my Lord.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.650
Ma, he's been very kind.
That's all.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:29.094
At least he's got time for me.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:33.191
Julia,
Henry can't be ten places at once.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:36.136
And don't tell me
that your daddy could.

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:39.766
Now pull yourself together, young lady.

01:19:39.842 --> 01:19:42.242
You're a married woman.

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:47.476
Oh, Ma, I can look in the window.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.983
Even if I don't buy.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:54.989
Well, you just better not go window
shopping with money in your pocket.

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:59.824
And you better not be puttin' anything
in the layaway plan, either.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:02.887
- You hear me?
- Oh, Ma.

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.835
% Two turtledoves%

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.505
- % And a partridge in a pear tree% %

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.743
- Let's do it again.
- Oh, no more, Jer, please.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.308
- Oooh!
- Your dad's home.

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:27.287
Daddy, where were you?

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.688
I'm sorry, Jer.
I really am.

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:33.387
I just can't understand why the traffic
was so bad. We'll go tomorrow, okay?

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:36.692
Okay. I did skating, Dad.

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:39.029
You did? Good for you.

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:43.367
And I got Billy Eldridge
home for Christmas.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.374
They dropped the charges, Henry.
How'd you do it?

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:51.038
I just remembered you gotta look someone
in the eye to see if they're innocent.

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:54.241
So it wasn't that hard.

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.877
- Daddy?
- Yes, son?

01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:00.888
- Skating isn't hard, neither.
- It isn't?

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:03.117
Your mom taught you, huh?

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.389
Dudley and Mom.
It was fun!

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.857
Dudley went skating
with you?

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:15.370
We waited for you, Henry.
You didn't miss much at all.

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:27.475
Ah, Henry! Just the man I wanted
to see. I've been working on this...

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:30.518
Keep away from my wife.

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:32.713
What'd I do now?

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:35.723
- You take her to lunch.
- Well, you were late, Henry.

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:38.089
- You take her to Jazzie’s.
- You asked me to.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.652
You take her skating.
What kind of man do you think I am?

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:44.494
Keep the hell away from her.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:47.057
Henry, you're a man of God.

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:51.266
That doesn't mean I'm blind.
Now, I've seen the way she looks at you.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.741
Really? I mean, really.

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:58.678
All right, fine.
I want you to leave now.

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.908
- Now?
- Yes, now.

01:22:00.983 --> 01:22:04.441
I don't think I can do that.
Check the angel handbook.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.250
It says I can't leave
until I'm through, I think.

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.449
You see, it says right here...

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:11.993
Wait a minute.
Hey! Henry!

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:16.194
What was that?

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:21.202
- Oooh!
- My goodness!

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:24.205
- What?
- You're in trouble.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.571
What was that?
What is that?

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:28.940
It wasn't a sign
that there's a new pope.

01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:32.139
- What do you mean?
- You're in trouble.
You want me out of the house.

01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:35.377
- Yes, I want you out.
- I'm not the problem. It wasn't me.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:38.146
- It wasn't me!
- Who are you talking to?
Get out of my house!

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:40.484
What is going on in here?

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:43.923
- I am terminating Dudley's services.
- Is that what you want, Julia?

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:47.428
It isn't a question of what she wants.

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:51.023
All right, Julia, you're a part of this.
You say.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:55.331
You two stop this right now.
Just stop it!

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:58.305
You hear me?

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:02.741
- You see what you did?
- It's not about me.

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:06.008
You and Julia would have these problems
even if I never showed up.

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:10.177
You've forgotten what's important,
for you and for her.

01:23:10.252 --> 01:23:12.846
And you're going to remind me, I'm sure.

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:15.822
St. Matt's is more
than just a church, Henry.

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:18.826
It's the glue that holds everything
together in this neighborhood.

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:22.955
And you mark my word, without it, this
neighborhood will fall, I guarantee it.

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:26.728
And Julia will never look at you
the same.

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:40.039
Hey, handsome.
Come and walk me across the street.

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.845
I gotta take this plate
over to Bessie Adams.

01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:45.853
- Well, actually, I was...
- Walk me!

01:23:45.921 --> 01:23:47.786
Delighted.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:56.455
- I heard what you two
were talking about.
- Really?

01:23:56.532 --> 01:24:01.128
Now, you know I don't usually
pry into other folks' business.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.933
- Uh-huh.
- Hold on a second.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.641
Mmm-mm!

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:14.542
Now, what are you doing
to my daughter?

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:17.676
Mrs. Coleman, it's all right,
I promise you.

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:23.487
Nothin' is all right, Dudley, when I see
a married woman look at a man that way.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:26.722
I'm just tryin' to help them,
that's all.

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:32.166
You really shouldn't smoke.
Our time here on Earth is precious.

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:34.258
That's right.

01:24:34.336 --> 01:24:39.171
And you know the most precious time
of all is time spent with your family.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:43.041
Now, you know I'm supposed
to only be here through Christmas.

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:46.512
But I will conveniently
have a hip injury...

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.914
and stay to the year 2000
if I have to.

01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:51.214
Do you understand
what I'm sayin' to you?

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:53.220
- I do now.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:57.054
Look, I'm havin' a little trouble
tryin' to get through to Henry.

01:24:57.125 --> 01:25:00.253
Now, Julia, on the other hand,
she's wonderful. She deserves...

01:25:00.329 --> 01:25:03.423
What are you talkin' about what Julia
deserves and what she don't?

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:06.296
She's Henry's wife.

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:08.461
Don't worry. L...

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:12.530
I'm sure she'll forget me
as soon as I leave.

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.907
She'll forget herself
if you go on like this.

01:25:15.978 --> 01:25:18.276
Marguerite, is that you?

01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:20.406
I'm comin', Bessie!

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:24.475
Now, Dudley, you are a charming person.

01:25:24.553 --> 01:25:27.317
You go charm somebody else.

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:29.721
Okay?

01:25:41.403 --> 01:25:44.395
Bessie, I'm comin' in.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.806
Did I tell you I quit smokin'?

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:50.276
I'm so proud of you, sugar.

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:58.010
Watch it. Don't slip now.

01:25:58.086 --> 01:26:02.182
Come on, babies, let's go. Thank you
so much. Now you have a lot more room.

01:26:02.257 --> 01:26:04.851
- Bye.
- Hi, Dudley!

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:08.362
- I'm just baby-sitting Jeremiah.

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:11.627
- Mommy, Mommy! Here, puppy.
- Get away from that dog!

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.100
- Go ahead!
- Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:16.103
Saul!

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:19.368
Where's he goin'now?

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:24.037
Thank you so much for the ride.
I know you had to go out of your way.

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:28.674
The first five minutes of The Nutcracker
hasn't changed any since last year.

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:32.379
- I'll make 'em leave before the bows
so we can come and get you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:26:32.454 --> 01:26:34.786
- Um...
- Um...

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.848
- Thanks.

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:41.225
Okay.

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:43.730
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:47.200
No time for that, Saul.
Come on, we're gonna be late.

01:26:47.269 --> 01:26:51.228
Oh, Santa, just leave that man
under my tree... if he'll fit.

01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:56.543
% We all want to make
a place in this world%

01:26:56.745 --> 01:27:01.648
% We all want our voices

% Everyone%

% Wants a chance to be someone%

% We all have dreams

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:18.265

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:22.133
% 'Cause when you reach and find%

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:26.105
% You've found someone%

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:30.201
% You'll hold this world's

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:34.442
% The greatest gift

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:38.612

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:42.179
% You were loved% %

01:27:56.638 --> 01:28:00.472
Oh, Keeleys...
Take a left at Woodlawn.

01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:02.908
The Keeleys live on Sixth.

01:28:02.978 --> 01:28:06.812
Henry, the Keeleys
live on Woodlawn.

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:11.178
- You're jealous.
- I am not jealous.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:14.722
- Yes, you are.
- I may be a lot of things,
but jealous is not one of them.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:18.055
Sure, you are. You're so jealous,
you can't even think straight.

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.492
I am thinking just fine, thank you.

01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:24.396
- You can't even remember
where the Keeleys live.
- The Keeleys' house is on Sixth.

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:27.128
- Then what's it doing over there?
- What?

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:31.468
Hmm.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.737
Keeleys moved.

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:37.836
Woodlawn. Sixth.

01:28:37.913 --> 01:28:41.679
- Is this it?
- Mm-hmm. There's the house.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.810
- Be careful, Henry.
- I will be.

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:48.322
Drive all this way,
they're probably not even home.

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:53.361
At least they could
shovel their walkway.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:58.360
- Whoooaaah!

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:08.432
Henry!

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.604
What are you laughin' at?

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:15.114
You look like a kid.
Are you all right?

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.378
- I'm fine.
- Let me help you up.

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:19.943
Thanks, babe.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:23.616
- Oh, baby. What are you doing?

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:28.459
- I thought you was helpin'me up.
- You did this on purpose.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.828
Eddie, come here quick.
It's the preacher.

01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:34.391
- What's goin' on?
- I hope you didn't hurt yourself.

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:36.733
- You all right?
- We're fine.

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:39.239
I told these kids to shovel that walk.

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:42.071
They ain't got nothin' on their mind
but Santa Claus. Sorry.

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:44.407
- This is yours. Merry Christmas.
- Us?

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:47.073
- Merry Christmas.
- God bless you.

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:50.640
- You'll catch cold. Be careful.
- We will.

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:52.846
I'll see you on Sunday.

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:55.481
We'll be there. All of us.

01:29:57.325 --> 01:30:00.419
Seems like
we've been doin' this forever.

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:03.862
Forever is right.
Do you remember the first time?

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:06.867
- My mother was visiting, yeah.
- Yes.

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:10.598
- You know, Henry, she never liked me.
- No, no, that's not true.

01:30:10.672 --> 01:30:15.371
She used to say, "Girl, you better
get some meat on them there bones."

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:17.843
Well, she just wanted
you to eat, that's all.

01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:21.178
- No, she wanted me to be as fat as her.
- She wasn't that fat.

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:26.016
Henry, a policeman walk down the street,
see your mama and go, "Break it up!"

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:29.215
- Stop!

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:31.521
Stop it!

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:34.357
Rest her soul.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.920
It's good to see you laugh again.

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:41.631
It's nice to have a reason to.

01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:46.937
You know, I miss this Henry.

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:50.466
I wish he'd show up more often.

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:07.020
There.
We did it.

01:31:09.064 --> 01:31:12.966
I'm gonna go to the church for a minute.
You go on inside.

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:22.968
- There we go.
- Thank you.

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:26.810
- Don't slip.
- I won't. Don't be long.

01:32:56.638 --> 01:32:59.072
- We could sell ads.
- I think it could work.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.041
- Sounds okay to me.
- Mr. Hamilton?

01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:05.011
- Is that gonna slow us down?
- Excuse me, Mr. Hamilton.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.641
- Yes, Bernita?
- Reverend Biggs is here to see you.

01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:12.913
- Henry!
- Joe.

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:20.153
Uh... Joe...
I need to speak with you.

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.660
Can we...

01:33:21.728 --> 01:33:24.663
Go ahead. I have no secrets from
my own people here. In fact, sit down...

01:33:24.731 --> 01:33:27.529
I've reconsidered.
I don't want the job.

01:33:27.567 --> 01:33:31.435
- Let's go, guys.
- I can't leave my own people, Joe.

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:34.406
And they can't afford
to travel clear up here.

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:39.138
- And as far as moving, Julia and l...
- Henry, a deal is a deal.

01:33:39.212 --> 01:33:42.113
My decision is final.

01:33:42.182 --> 01:33:44.116
I'm sorry.

01:33:44.184 --> 01:33:48.450
You're sorry.
Sorry is not good enough, Henry!

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:52.288
You don't get it, Henry.
I don't care about St. Matt's.

01:33:52.359 --> 01:33:55.123
St. Matt's is where we've been,
not where we're going!

01:33:55.195 --> 01:33:58.255
Only if people like you abandon it, Joe.

01:34:03.703 --> 01:34:06.001
You know, it used to be
you couldn't just pick up...

01:34:06.072 --> 01:34:09.803
and move away from your own people
as soon as you made a couple of bucks.

01:34:09.876 --> 01:34:12.777
There was nowhere else for us to go.

01:34:12.846 --> 01:34:15.815
But at least our kids
got to grow up with their heroes.

01:34:15.882 --> 01:34:19.113
Henry, I'm trying to be nice to you
because you and I go back a ways...

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:21.984
and the old reverend
was always real good to me.

01:34:22.055 --> 01:34:24.990
But this is gonna happen
whether you want it to or not.

01:34:25.058 --> 01:34:28.152
With all due respect, Joe,
how do you think you can make me...

01:34:28.228 --> 01:34:31.026
Not you. The church.
It's coming down.

01:34:31.097 --> 01:34:33.361
What's coming down?

01:34:33.433 --> 01:34:35.697
The church is...

01:34:35.769 --> 01:34:40.001
Henry, do you know why I am
a trustee of a church I don't go to?

01:34:40.073 --> 01:34:45.170
Because your deacons
all came begging to me,
telling me how broke the church was.

01:34:45.245 --> 01:34:48.476
I bought the mortgage.
That's right!

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:53.519
I own it, and it's coming down.
That land's worth a lot more to me
with nothing on it.

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:56.818
- You're gonna tear down my church?
- That's right.

01:34:56.923 --> 01:35:00.654
- A-And build a mall and tennis courts.
- Tennis courts?

01:35:00.727 --> 01:35:04.993
Henry, we're gonna turn
that neighborhood around,
attract some real money to that place.

01:35:05.065 --> 01:35:07.192
- Oh, I see. Yeah.
- You see what I'm saying?

01:35:07.267 --> 01:35:11.363
You think without me there to lead them,
the people will just cave in.

01:35:11.438 --> 01:35:14.601
- That's why you got me here!
- No, Henry, I want you to lead them.

01:35:14.674 --> 01:35:19.338
- But into the future.
- Whose future, Joe?
They don't play much tennis.

01:35:23.817 --> 01:35:27.583
Joe, come back to the church.
See exactly who you'll be hurting.

01:35:27.654 --> 01:35:31.920
See their faces, their families, their...
their children, Joe.

01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:38.086
People are a lot tougher
than you think, Henry.

01:35:41.968 --> 01:35:45.904
Henry, look.
Come on, they'll survive.

01:35:45.972 --> 01:35:50.432
And you still think you care
about the things we care about?

01:35:54.948 --> 01:35:59.317
"Hark! I hear Joseph
and Mary in the manger."

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:01.445
- That's what I say.
- Only louder.

01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:05.719
"Hark! I hear Joseph
and Mary in the manger."

01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:09.284
Then Michael and Jessica come on...

01:36:09.362 --> 01:36:12.422
and sing a really slow song.

01:36:12.499 --> 01:36:15.991
It's not that slow,
and it's very pretty.

01:36:16.069 --> 01:36:19.596
Meanin' to ask you,
you two have a fight last night?

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:22.141
No, Ma, we delivered
Christmas baskets.

01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:25.939
- The gym socks were a big hit.
- Huh! I knew they would be.

01:36:26.012 --> 01:36:28.913
- That you were right about.
- Hi there.

01:36:28.982 --> 01:36:30.950
- Henry.
- Hello.

01:36:31.017 --> 01:36:36.455
Dad, Jason got sick, and I'm gonna be
a shepherd in the nativity play.

01:36:36.523 --> 01:36:40.357
- I won't have to say "baaa."
- Ohh.

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:42.827
- That's great.

01:36:42.896 --> 01:36:47.629
'Cause someone very special
is gonna be in the audience
listening to every word you say.

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.669
Huh?

01:36:49.736 --> 01:36:54.298
- Your mother and I figured out
what you'd like for Christmas.
- Yeah.

01:36:54.374 --> 01:36:57.969
- Did you wrap it up?
- Not quite.

01:36:58.044 --> 01:37:01.480
Hakim!

01:37:01.548 --> 01:37:04.984
I missed you.

01:37:07.187 --> 01:37:10.020
Ohhh.

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:12.615
Is he going to stay
forever and ever?

01:37:12.692 --> 01:37:16.685
Well, just 'til the new year.
Then after that, we'll see.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.961
I have a secret to tell you.
My ambulance has a siren now.

01:37:24.037 --> 01:37:26.505
Really?

01:37:26.573 --> 01:37:29.508
God bless Mommy and Daddy...

01:37:29.576 --> 01:37:31.510
And Grandma...

01:37:31.578 --> 01:37:33.808
- And my grandma.
- Amen.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.145
- Okay, guys, you ready?
- We did our prayers.

01:37:37.217 --> 01:37:40.152
'Cause we were already on our knees.

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:44.122
Okay. It's time to get into bed now.
Come on.

01:37:45.925 --> 01:37:47.825
Boing!

01:37:47.927 --> 01:37:50.327
All right.
Good night.

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:52.661
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:37:52.732 --> 01:37:55.326
No talking late now.

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:58.838
Close the door, please.

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:04.138
Okay.

01:38:05.745 --> 01:38:08.646
- Wait 'til you meet Dudley.
- Who's that?

01:38:08.748 --> 01:38:11.683
- The man in the gray coat.
- Huh?

01:38:11.751 --> 01:38:14.652
- You remember.
- Oh!

01:38:19.993 --> 01:38:23.019
Christmas is supposed to be...

01:38:23.096 --> 01:38:27.294
the most joyous day of the year.

01:38:50.690 --> 01:38:53.284
- Henry?
- Hmm?

01:38:53.359 --> 01:38:56.817
- Would you like some hot chocolate?
- No, thank you.

01:38:56.896 --> 01:38:59.091
I've got to check the fuse box.

01:38:59.165 --> 01:39:03.864
If we put any more lights on that tree,
we're gonna blow up the house.

01:39:33.099 --> 01:39:37.195
Christmas is supposed
to be the most joyous day of the year.

01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:40.364
But for St. Matt's,
it's a day to surrender.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.706
Not because I'm going to preach
at another church,
as some may believe...

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:49.340
but because the people who own
the building are going to tear it down.

01:39:49.415 --> 01:39:53.181
- Now, it's no one's fault.
There is no one to blame.
- Henry.

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:57.053
It just seems as though despite
our best efforts, our dream...

01:39:57.123 --> 01:40:01.355
- my dream for St. Matthew's...
will not come to pass.
- Ohhh.

01:40:01.427 --> 01:40:05.363
But let's remember the good things
we've shared over the years.

01:40:05.431 --> 01:40:08.366
The laughter, the exploding boiler...

01:40:08.434 --> 01:40:11.631
the sounds of voices raised to heaven.

01:40:11.704 --> 01:40:14.639
I'll miss it all.
I thank you for your efforts.

01:40:14.707 --> 01:40:17.471
I thank you for your friendship.

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:21.378
God bless you.
I love you all.

% Sleep in heavenly peace%

01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:07.619
- May I help you?
- Good evening.
I'm Rev. Biggs' assistant.

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:11.596
- Wait in the living room, please.
- Thank you.

01:41:11.764 --> 01:41:15.860
- Okay, Bernita, I'll take care of it.

01:41:15.935 --> 01:41:20.235
I ain't buying!
For God's sake, it's Christmas Eve!

01:41:20.306 --> 01:41:22.467
For the sake of God indeed.

01:41:22.542 --> 01:41:26.410
Henry Biggs sent you here. I told him
he's through. To hell with him.

01:41:26.479 --> 01:41:31.075
No, to heaven with him, Joe. That's
a plan not even you could mess up.

01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:35.416
- Look, I don't know who you are, but...
- I'm an angel.

01:41:35.488 --> 01:41:38.548
- No, not yours.

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:42.584
No, I'm afraid yours
is a long way off.

01:41:42.662 --> 01:41:46.063
I'm a very busy man,
and you're wasting my time.

01:41:46.132 --> 01:41:48.930
Now, I'm giving 'em another church.
St. Matt's is...

01:42:06.519 --> 01:42:08.783
What is this?

01:42:08.855 --> 01:42:11.289
It's like your past, Joe.

01:42:11.357 --> 01:42:14.258
You can walk away from it,
but it's still there.

01:42:17.363 --> 01:42:20.264
What do you see
when you look at a place like this?

01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:22.801
I'll tell you what I see.
Sterling Acres.

01:42:22.869 --> 01:42:25.099
The latest development miracle
from Hamilton Realty.

01:42:25.171 --> 01:42:27.969
I see 200 luxury apartments.

01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:31.442
Over here, a 24-hour health club
right on the grounds.

01:42:31.544 --> 01:42:34.513
- State of the art designer interiors.
- This thing is broken.

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:37.708
- The kind of home that you deserve.
- It's not even plugged in.

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:41.686
- That's very smooth,
however you did all this.

01:42:44.557 --> 01:42:47.993
But you gotta do
better than that.

01:42:48.061 --> 01:42:51.155
Yeah... you gotta do
a lot better than that...

01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:53.790
to get to me.

01:42:57.036 --> 01:43:01.632
Have to do a whole lot better than that
to get to me.

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.767
Whoever you are.

01:43:03.876 --> 01:43:06.845
Don't worry about who I am, Joe.

01:43:06.913 --> 01:43:09.143
You won't even remember me tomorrow.

01:43:09.215 --> 01:43:11.410
But remember this:

01:43:11.484 --> 01:43:15.352
Look at the real price
before you close the deal.

01:43:15.421 --> 01:43:19.357
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.

01:43:19.425 --> 01:43:22.690
Listen to your heart.
Do what it tells you.

01:43:22.762 --> 01:43:25.560
You'll find your way.

01:43:35.675 --> 01:43:40.476
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.

01:43:43.616 --> 01:43:48.349
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.

01:43:51.624 --> 01:43:55.185
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.

01:43:55.261 --> 01:43:58.196
- Where's Joseph and Mary?

01:43:59.832 --> 01:44:01.766
Ohhh.

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:16.447
See the infant, meek and mild.

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:20.418
He is God's anointed child.

01:44:20.486 --> 01:44:23.114
So celebrate this Christmas morn.

01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:27.592
For on this day, His son is born!

01:44:29.996 --> 01:44:32.556
Julia.

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:39.300
I wanted to see you
to say good-bye.

01:44:39.372 --> 01:44:43.308
No, no. I'll call the council
and tell them that we still need you.

01:44:43.376 --> 01:44:46.106
Well, this is over
the council's head.

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:50.946
Way over their head.
Besides, it's time.

01:44:51.017 --> 01:44:52.985
How can it be time?

01:44:53.052 --> 01:44:55.077
It just is.

01:44:55.154 --> 01:44:57.850
It's funny, you know,
I spent the last 30 years...

01:44:57.924 --> 01:45:00.984
thinking I'd be happy
if I could just get back to this place.

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:05.121
Here? The council must send you
to some dead neighborhoods.

01:45:05.198 --> 01:45:08.190
Well, dead is relative.

01:45:08.267 --> 01:45:10.827
But now I know where I belong.

01:45:10.903 --> 01:45:12.996
Is this because of me?

01:45:13.072 --> 01:45:16.667
No. Mmm.

01:45:18.911 --> 01:45:21.106
Well, maybe just a little bit.

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:23.774
You remember when you
asked me what you do...

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:27.479
when the flame between
two people goes out?

01:45:27.553 --> 01:45:29.748
Yes.

01:45:31.791 --> 01:45:35.454
The answer is:
You don't let it.

01:45:38.931 --> 01:45:42.458
Will we ever see you again?

01:45:42.535 --> 01:45:45.333
I don't know.

01:45:45.404 --> 01:45:47.429
Well, let's see.

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.304
No. Not again.

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:08.486
% Or maybe a fisherman%

01:46:08.561 --> 01:46:12.361
% Out on the sea%

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:20.205
- How can I thank you?
- You already have.

01:46:20.273 --> 01:46:23.572
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

01:46:23.643 --> 01:46:26.168
% Who would imagine%

01:46:26.245 --> 01:46:30.045
% A king%

01:46:30.116 --> 01:46:34.052
% It was so clear%

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.386
- Mrs. Biggs, here!
- Jessica, you still have
more songs to sing.

01:46:38.457 --> 01:46:40.755
I'm wet.

01:46:40.826 --> 01:46:44.557
Who would use
Baby Wet Wet for Jesus?

01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:47.531
Mrs... Biggs, our Virgin Mary bailed!

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.333
People are gonna know
that's not in the Bible. Do something!

01:46:54.974 --> 01:46:56.874
You better get out there.

01:47:12.124 --> 01:47:16.891
% That the world
would be different%

01:47:16.963 --> 01:47:20.558
% 'Cause you were alive%

01:47:20.633 --> 01:47:24.330
% That's when heaven stood still%

01:47:24.403 --> 01:47:29.340
% To proclaim%

01:47:29.408 --> 01:47:33.435
% One day an angel%

01:47:33.512 --> 01:47:37.812
% Said quietly%

01:47:37.883 --> 01:47:41.580
% That soon he would bring%

01:47:41.654 --> 01:47:46.114
% Something special to me%

01:47:46.192 --> 01:47:51.129
% And of all of
the wonderful gifts%

01:47:51.197 --> 01:47:54.758
% He could bring%

01:47:54.834 --> 01:47:59.498
% Who would imagine%

01:47:59.572 --> 01:48:04.475
% Who could imagine%

01:48:04.543 --> 01:48:09.480
% Who would imagine%

01:48:09.548 --> 01:48:18.388
% A king% %

01:48:18.457 --> 01:48:22.484
- Thank you.

01:48:22.561 --> 01:48:25.962
Hurry up.
Come on.

01:48:26.065 --> 01:48:28.659
- Mommy, was I good?
- Oh! The best donkey.

01:48:28.734 --> 01:48:30.793
I'll do it.

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:35.036
- Not bad, man.

01:48:35.107 --> 01:48:37.803
Oh, yes!

01:48:48.287 --> 01:48:50.983
"Christmas is supposed to be...

01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:53.923
"the most joyous day of the year.

01:48:53.993 --> 01:48:56.860
Amen!

01:48:56.929 --> 01:49:00.057
But for St. Matthew's, today is..."

01:49:07.239 --> 01:49:10.174
"For St. Matt's...

01:49:10.242 --> 01:49:13.575
today is supposed..."

01:49:27.159 --> 01:49:29.286
Beloved...

01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:32.229
God never promised us
a perfect life.

01:49:32.298 --> 01:49:34.459
Amen!

01:49:34.533 --> 01:49:36.933
He's saving that
for the hereafter.

01:49:37.002 --> 01:49:38.970
- Oh, no!
- Amen!

01:49:39.038 --> 01:49:43.407
While we're here on...
on this Earth...

01:49:43.476 --> 01:49:46.741
there's some things
we just got to work for.

01:49:46.812 --> 01:49:49.781
- Am I right about this?
- Yeah!

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:52.113
- He's not following the script.
- He's doing fine.

01:49:52.184 --> 01:49:54.550
- It could be a job.
- Uh-huh.

01:49:54.653 --> 01:49:58.145
- It could be a church.
- Amen!

01:49:58.224 --> 01:50:01.716
- It could be a community.
- Amen!

01:50:01.794 --> 01:50:04.763
- Could be a marriage.
- Amen!

01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:07.458
But the good news is...
is that He gave us...

01:50:07.533 --> 01:50:11.469
two secret weapons
to help us to succeed.

01:50:11.537 --> 01:50:14.404
- Hope...
- Hope!

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:16.805
- And love.
- And love!

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:18.935
- Hope.
- Hope.

01:50:19.011 --> 01:50:23.141
- That's all a prayer is.

01:50:23.215 --> 01:50:26.616
- And love.
- Love!

01:50:26.685 --> 01:50:29.620
- Loving is giving...
- Yeah!

01:50:29.688 --> 01:50:31.815
- Pure and simple.
- Amen!

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:35.987
But in love,
there is also forgiveness.

01:50:36.061 --> 01:50:38.859
- And forgiveness...

01:50:38.931 --> 01:50:40.956
belongs to everyone.

01:50:41.033 --> 01:50:43.024
- It's a right.
- Yeah!

01:50:43.102 --> 01:50:45.832
- Like a right to breathe or eat.
- Yeah!

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:48.965
Or even to fall in love.

01:50:49.041 --> 01:50:51.908
Amen!

01:50:55.714 --> 01:50:59.912
Sometimes we...
we take love for granted.

01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:05.151
- Am I right about it?

01:51:05.224 --> 01:51:08.284
Those who are nearest to us...

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.692
dearest to us...

01:51:12.731 --> 01:51:16.223
those are the ones
we forget to cherish.

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:18.896
But the miracle is...

01:51:18.971 --> 01:51:21.997
when we love someone...

01:51:22.074 --> 01:51:24.235
we are really loving God.

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:29.679
Look in wonder at those you love...

01:51:29.748 --> 01:51:33.548
for they are the face of God.

01:51:33.619 --> 01:51:36.019
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

01:51:36.088 --> 01:51:38.579
And when the path is dark...

01:51:38.657 --> 01:51:41.182
- Amen.
- And the road bends...

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:43.854
we will let the Lord show us the way.

01:51:43.929 --> 01:51:48.332
- He will give us heart
and make us whole.
- Amen!

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:51.528
You see, I know... because He did me!

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:55.335
- Yeah!
- You may ask me, "How?"

01:51:55.407 --> 01:51:59.173
How?

01:52:01.447 --> 01:52:04.382
You see, He's...

01:52:06.785 --> 01:52:09.117
You see,
He's got these angels...

01:52:09.188 --> 01:52:13.454
- Yeah.
- Waitin' on this long line...

01:52:13.526 --> 01:52:17.519
for the chance to come down
and help each and every one of us!

01:52:17.596 --> 01:52:19.621
- And they do!
- Yes!

01:52:19.698 --> 01:52:22.565
So you see, beloved,
today I am truly blessed.

01:52:22.635 --> 01:52:24.899
- Blessed with hope,
- Hope!

01:52:24.970 --> 01:52:26.961
- Blessed with love...
- Love!

01:52:27.039 --> 01:52:30.600
And blessed with a belief
that I can make a difference!

01:52:30.676 --> 01:52:33.236
- All of us can!

01:52:33.312 --> 01:52:36.748
We can save this church!

01:52:36.815 --> 01:52:38.874
- Yeah!
- He's got a point.

01:52:38.951 --> 01:52:42.250
- We will help our poor!
- Oh, yes!

01:52:42.321 --> 01:52:45.290
- We will help our young!
- All right!

01:52:45.357 --> 01:52:48.690
- And our lonely and our needy!

01:52:48.794 --> 01:52:52.594
So now let us begin again.
Let us go forward.

01:52:52.665 --> 01:52:55.600
- Forward in hope, forward in love...
- Hope! Love!

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:59.570
And forward into
the new days of our lives!

01:52:59.638 --> 01:53:01.902
Put your hands together
and praise God!

01:53:01.974 --> 01:53:04.966
- Whoo!

01:53:06.178 --> 01:53:10.080
Praise Him! Hallelujah!

01:53:17.356 --> 01:53:21.452
% I love the... %

01:53:21.527 --> 01:53:27.090

01:57:42.988 --> 01:57:45.286
- You were so good today.
- Merry Christmas, Saul.

01:57:45.357 --> 01:57:47.917
- Merry Christmas, Henry, Julia.
- You still going to be
a member in the spring?

01:57:47.993 --> 01:57:51.190
Member? I'm planning on
getting married in this church.

01:57:51.263 --> 01:57:53.925
- To who?
- Who do you think?

01:57:53.999 --> 01:57:57.264
- You're my little lamb dumpling.

01:57:59.104 --> 01:58:02.232
- We're gonna have a daddy?
- Did he say "lamb dumpling"?

01:58:02.307 --> 01:58:04.901
I can't believe you
said that to the pastor.

01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:07.707
Oh, well, the pastor's gonna have to
get himself a new secretary.

01:58:07.779 --> 01:58:11.806
- I'm gonna have to pray on that.
- Joe, Merry Christmas.

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:15.877
You belong here, Henry. Call me Monday.
We'll work that mortgage thing out.

01:58:15.954 --> 01:58:19.117
That's wonderful.

01:58:19.191 --> 01:58:21.591
- Call me.
- I will.

01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.924
Henry, you did it!

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:26.260
No, honey, we did.

01:58:26.331 --> 01:58:29.562
- Good sermon, Reverend.
- Merry Christmas.

01:58:29.635 --> 01:58:32.331
Merry Christmas.

01:58:32.404 --> 01:58:35.134
- Who's that?
- I don't know.
Maybe he's new in the neighborhood.

01:58:35.207 --> 01:58:38.472
Come on, boys!
Let's go!

01:58:38.543 --> 01:58:40.909
Hey, Merry Christmas, Dudley.

01:58:40.979 --> 01:58:43.675
Merry Christmas to you, too, Jeremiah.

01:58:43.749 --> 01:58:46.149
Lunch and presents. Come on, boys!

01:58:46.218 --> 01:58:48.152
Jeremiah, give me your hand, honey.

01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:50.188
Mom, did you get Dudley a present?

01:58:50.255 --> 01:58:52.189
Jeremiah, who is Dudley, baby?

01:58:52.257 --> 01:58:56.990
- Ma, you know Dudley.
- Come on, boys, let's go get some soup.

01:58:57.062 --> 01:59:01.260
That was
a long time ago. At least a year.

01:59:01.333 --> 01:59:04.063
Before Hakim came
to live with us for good.

01:59:04.169 --> 01:59:05.966
Wow!

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:08.666
And became my real brother.

01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.674
It's beautiful!

01:59:10.742 --> 01:59:12.835
You must've sat up
with that all night, baby.

01:59:12.911 --> 01:59:15.106
- Mama, you didn't.
- With my back?

01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:18.343
My parents still think I made Dudley up.

01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:21.784
They say,
"If he's so real, then where is he?"

01:59:21.853 --> 01:59:25.220
But just like I told Daddy...

01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:27.884
just because you can't see the air...

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:30.360
doesn't stop you from breathing.

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:32.989
And just 'cause you can't see God...

01:59:33.065 --> 01:59:35.556
it don't stop you from believing.

01:59:35.634 --> 01:59:38.194
Then Daddy smiled and said...

01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:41.831
"Son, that's what we call faith."

01:59:41.907 --> 01:59:45.138
