WEBVTT

01:23.170 --> 01:24.606
Henry Dobson.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.999
293 Riverview Place,
Wichita Falls.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.133
Open up the truck or
that's gonna be our next stop.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.962
We know your family's
there. Tick-tock.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.886
Merry Christmas, Thomas Serano.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.776
Ow. Ow. Okay.
All right, let's go.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.778
Slow down, Augie.
- Wait for me.
- Let's set it down.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.390
Come on. It hurts.

02:09.433 --> 02:12.219
Okay.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.177
All right, is it bad that
I can't rotate it that way,

02:14.221 --> 02:16.440
or, like, hell,
any way, anymore?

02:16.484 --> 02:18.573
Maybe Dad should take you
to the doctors.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.140
Smart, Stel.
Then he finds out

02:20.183 --> 02:21.793
we were trespassing
at the Davidsons.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.100
Not if you come up with
an alternate cause of injury.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.406
Yeah, because
we're all as fluent

02:25.449 --> 02:27.147
in lying to Dad
as you are? Right.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.497
You're right. He always
somehow knows with you.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.846
It's just me? Really?

02:30.889 --> 02:32.152
I could use one last night
of freedom,

02:32.195 --> 02:34.458
is all, especially after exams.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.504
You sure you'll be okay?

02:36.547 --> 02:38.070
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm sure.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.681
You know, I've got
- to play piano tonight.
- Okay.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.683
And Faye's gonna be at the
Sacred Heart holiday thing,

02:41.726 --> 02:43.163
so, you know...

02:43.206 --> 02:45.556
One text from a girl,
and this guy is willing

02:45.600 --> 02:47.210
to risk bodily harm.

02:47.254 --> 02:50.039
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
One text from a girl?

02:50.082 --> 02:51.693
All right, I heard that,
and who is

02:51.736 --> 02:53.085
this girl we speak of?

02:53.129 --> 02:56.176
- Augie's new crush.
- Ooh. Yeah?

02:57.046 --> 02:59.440
Hey, Lothario, you check
that thing for sap before

02:59.483 --> 03:01.181
- you dragged it in here?
- Is that a thing?

03:01.224 --> 03:03.574
Send a boy
to do a man's job.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.534
All right, Daddy, pop quiz.

03:06.577 --> 03:09.363
You, uh, remember this record?

03:09.406 --> 03:11.756
Yeah?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.411
Someone found their
- Christmas spirit early.
- Well...

03:14.455 --> 03:16.761
Does anyone else
hear it skipping?

03:16.805 --> 03:18.415
Please hide that vinyl before

03:18.459 --> 03:21.070
Mawline has it on repeat
until New Years.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.985
What's up
with Bah-Humbug Bonham, eh?

03:23.028 --> 03:24.465
Maybe it's the sap, son.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.121
Cordell, could you go in there
and see if you can convince

03:29.165 --> 03:31.646
your railroad baron brother
if he can go out and rustle up

03:31.689 --> 03:33.213
a proper Douglas fir?

03:33.256 --> 03:34.344
I don't know what the hell
that thing is.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.824
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm on it, Daddy.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.521
We got this.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.702
Whoa.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.923
All right. I like it. Oh.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.403
Uh, all right.

03:49.446 --> 03:54.364
Real talk. Where is
Ebenezer headed this year?

03:54.408 --> 03:56.540
We totally got to get Mom.
You know that.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.803
- I was thinking over by the pond.
- No, no, no, no, no.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.849
Hey, where did we hide 'em
that year

04:00.892 --> 04:02.633
that we-we stumped her
on Christmas Eve?

04:02.677 --> 04:06.071
Oh, yeah. That was, uh... that
was the butcher shop, right?

04:06.115 --> 04:08.073
It was '93, same
year as the Light War.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.293
The-the Light War?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.948
Right. I think you're right.
That-that was the year that

04:12.991 --> 04:14.428
the power went out, right?
What a Christmas.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.212
That's what happens
when you follow the rules.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.040
You and the rules.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.869
I'm just saying that it was
agreed upon and stipulated

04:20.912 --> 04:22.566
by the Davidsons
not to use a generator,

04:22.610 --> 04:24.612
especially not for an
- up-lit Nativity scene.
- Okay, okay.

04:24.655 --> 04:25.961
- But, you know.
- Okay, may-maybe

04:26.004 --> 04:28.180
we give the Davidsons
a-a pass this year.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.791
You know what I mean?
I mean, not like

04:29.834 --> 04:31.619
we could use another war
right now.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.838
I told you, I can be civil
with the neighbors.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.362
- It's all good.
- Yeah, that's great.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.929
No, I... Civil, it's all
in the past, in the rearview.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.279
Um, and...

04:39.322 --> 04:43.152
and we, uh--
you and me-- we're good?

04:43.195 --> 04:45.415
Yeah, man, we're-we're good.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.764
Good.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.116
Hmm.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.075
Denise. Hey.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.772
- Come in.
- Nice. Nice.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.600
Uh, yeah.
Oh.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.733
Well, this brings me back.

04:58.776 --> 05:02.650
Oh, yeah. We are going all-out
this year. How about y'all?

05:02.693 --> 05:06.436
Uh, no, I don't think it's in
the cards for me this year.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.569
I mean, I'd need a whole family
of volunteers.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.527
And nobody's available, so...

05:10.571 --> 05:12.486
Besides, the morning
I just had,

05:12.529 --> 05:15.010
I don't even think I'm gonna do
the holidays at all this year.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.403
So,

05:16.446 --> 05:18.579
just got a flurry
of phone calls from North Texas.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.929
An evidence transport vehicle
was hijacked

05:20.972 --> 05:22.539
by a group
of holly jolly jackasses.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.107
Roughed up the driver,
took off with the van.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.370
Tons of evidence
from the Serano case was inside.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.415
Only identifier

05:28.458 --> 05:29.894
is that the hijackers

05:29.938 --> 05:31.592
were wearing reindeer masks.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.028
- Reindeer masks?
- Yeah.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.421
Where are we talking?

05:34.464 --> 05:37.206
Up in Thalia,
my old stomping grounds.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.816
- Thalia?
- Yeah.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.123
Okay, so-so you know
all the local players.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.559
That's-that's perfect.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.082
I'll get my stuff,
we'll go to your place,

05:44.126 --> 05:45.867
- grab your stuff, and head out.
- Uh...

05:45.910 --> 05:48.522
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but, um,

05:48.565 --> 05:50.001
Liam should go
with you.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.525
Town that small,
all the locals just clam up

05:51.568 --> 05:52.917
as soon as they see me.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.441
And Liam knows the contents

05:54.484 --> 05:55.833
of the evidence
van, so...

05:55.877 --> 05:59.533
- Great. Yeah. We'll get on it.
- Okay.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.849
You should answer.

06:11.893 --> 06:15.026
If it's Walker,
it's probably important.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.724
This is important.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.421
Oh, Mick, I got a big
day ahead of me, and I...

06:18.465 --> 06:20.945
And I came home to a big
Post-it note last night.

06:20.989 --> 06:25.080
Please let me explain
about him, about everything.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.560
I never should have
let it get this far,

06:26.603 --> 06:28.910
and I've been up all night
trying to figure out

06:28.953 --> 06:30.999
how to explain all this to you.

06:45.492 --> 06:49.017
Garrison was someone who worked
with Yvette in Del Rio.

06:49.060 --> 06:52.673
But he also knew the younger me

06:52.716 --> 06:56.416
from before, from San Antonio.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.680
He was my ex.

07:00.681 --> 07:01.943
But we weren't

07:01.986 --> 07:04.336
a couple who went mini golfing.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.382
We were a couple
of 18-year-olds

07:06.426 --> 07:08.253
we would knock back 30 racks

07:08.297 --> 07:10.255
before the streetlights came on.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.649
So he was your messy ex.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.913
Everybody has one.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.438
And he paints.
Okay, good for him.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.744
But what I can't understand
is why you...

07:20.788 --> 07:22.354
- I kept it from you?
- No.

07:22.398 --> 07:26.315
Why you lied and
why you kept lying.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.755
He wasn't just my ex.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.105
He was my fiancÃ©.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.978
You were engaged?

07:39.937 --> 07:42.113
Did you know he was in Del Rio
when you went down there?

07:42.157 --> 07:46.117
No. No, I-I thought he was dead

07:46.161 --> 07:49.469
until he stepped out
of the car with Serano.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.296
And for hours, I...

07:52.080 --> 07:54.778
I had him.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.911
Hey, Mick, please.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.869
You can trust me.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.178
I had him...

08:03.221 --> 08:05.354
and then he slipped.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.966
Right out of my hands.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.273
He just slipped.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.146
You ever have the...

08:15.190 --> 08:17.148
fork-in-the-road moment

08:17.192 --> 08:19.542
where you shake up fate?

08:21.457 --> 08:24.373
I lost Garrison the first time
because I couldn't save him.

08:24.416 --> 08:28.029
So I left.
And then, losing him again

08:28.072 --> 08:31.162
just forced me to...

08:31.206 --> 08:33.425
reexamine that fork.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.516
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.171
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, Mick.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.347
Hey, look at me.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.175
Mick,

08:44.219 --> 08:46.221
I'm sorry that
you went through that,

08:46.264 --> 08:47.962
and I'm even more sorry
that I wasn't there

08:48.005 --> 08:49.964
to help you through that.

08:50.007 --> 08:53.620
You are now, I hope.

08:56.536 --> 09:01.410
That's the truth
about... Del Rio.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.110
And that is a lot for 8:00 a.m.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.462
Yeah. A little bit.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.727
But I'm glad that you told me.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.119
Are we okay?

09:15.163 --> 09:18.732
I didn't light this entire thing
on fire, did I?

09:18.775 --> 09:21.299
Come on. It's us.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.953
It's tricky.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.477
You remember, huh?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.262
And it's a painting.

09:27.305 --> 09:30.091
Look, I wasn't gonna
say nothing, but...

09:30.134 --> 09:32.920
- it's not that good.
- It sucks.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.575
Yeah, it really does.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.669
We are solid, yeah.

09:42.712 --> 09:45.497
I'm so glad.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.892
Because, um,

09:48.936 --> 09:50.677
I'm off duty today,

09:50.720 --> 09:54.332
and I heard there may be
a party at Sacred Heart.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.595
You trying to
turn up? Huh?

10:07.824 --> 10:10.087
Look at this.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.307
The Brothers Walker
take to the field

10:12.350 --> 10:14.483
to find the perfect
Christmas tree.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.659
And question
a prolific hijacker.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.487
Question a prolific hijacker.
Yes, I know that.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.315
Obviously. I'm just
saying, though,

10:20.358 --> 10:23.492
Daddy was none too pleased
with what the kids brought in.

10:23.535 --> 10:26.408
We could be heroes, you know?
We could be holiday heroes.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.366
Okay, well, let's just focus
on the task at hand first.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.064
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay?

10:30.107 --> 10:34.111
Excuse me.
You must be Boyd McNeil.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.940
Oh, lookat that.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.987
One of Texas' finest.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.249
What's your business with Boyd?

10:41.292 --> 10:42.816
There was
a pretty brazen robbery

10:42.859 --> 10:45.514
this morning
- just down the road a spell.
- Huh?

10:45.557 --> 10:48.256
What's that got to do with us?

10:48.299 --> 10:49.779
Well, this file
right here suggests

10:49.823 --> 10:52.347
that Boyd "Hot Rod" McNeil
is a prolific hijacker.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.784
Might know a thing
or two about, uh,

10:54.828 --> 10:57.700
freelance work for bigger fish,
maybe like Thomas Serano?

10:58.701 --> 11:00.311
You're a bit young.
You don't fit the profile.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.835
Maybe I'll pull your file and...

11:01.878 --> 11:03.532
Good luck finding one.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.929
Y'all excuse my nephew.
He's, uh,

11:08.972 --> 11:10.191
still growing
into his manners.

11:10.234 --> 11:11.714
- Yeah.
- So...

11:11.758 --> 11:14.325
You know, busy day.
Let's save some time.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.980
Now, I have receipts to prove
my whereabouts this morning,

11:17.024 --> 11:18.460
even a Yelp review.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.984
I had nothing to do with
this highway robbery.

11:22.159 --> 11:25.206
Now, Dan Miller,
on the other hand...

11:25.249 --> 11:27.164
Dan Miller? Dan...

11:28.296 --> 11:30.907
Dan Miller-- he, uh,
he a friend of yours?

11:30.951 --> 11:33.475
Well, you could say so.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.391
We dabbled in vehicle
relocation back in the day.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.133
Dan's who gave me
the "Hot Rod" nickname.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.570
He's also gave me this scar
from a ricochet,

11:41.613 --> 11:43.920
messing around
with some cola cans.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.966
- Just saying.
- You see...

11:46.009 --> 11:47.532
there's a problem.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.492
Dan Miller lives
in Austin now.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.624
Well, I hate to do your
job for you, Ranger,

11:52.668 --> 11:55.018
but that is
outdated information.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.804
He is right here in Thalia,

11:57.847 --> 11:59.719
chauffeuring that old
mother-in-law of his around.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.025
Curious timing, right?

12:02.069 --> 12:03.374
Or it could just
be someone trying

12:03.418 --> 12:04.898
to cast suspicion
off themselves.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.290
Oh, I like to
see just desserts

12:06.334 --> 12:08.379
go to folks who
deserve it, is all.

12:08.423 --> 12:11.905
Here. As I said, have at it.

12:11.948 --> 12:15.343
We will, don't you worry.
And, uh,

12:15.386 --> 12:17.258
you know, hopefully,
the only reason we return

12:17.301 --> 12:20.087
is to grab one of those
Douglas firs off you.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.680
Hey, man, you, uh...
you sing or play?

12:48.724 --> 12:51.205
Oh, no, not yet, no, no.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.511
My grandma says
I have an ear, but...

12:53.555 --> 12:56.601
I don't know. Always thought
it could be cool. Uh, you?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.342
I usually do the keys
for carols.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.430
It's actually kind of cool.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.518
Oh, so-so you're-you're kind of

13:00.562 --> 13:01.868
like, a big deal around here?

13:01.911 --> 13:03.391
I'll let the keys
speak for themselves.

13:08.439 --> 13:09.745
Ow!

13:09.789 --> 13:13.140
What, was that supposed
to be impressive?

13:13.183 --> 13:15.882
I may have had a slight mishap
involving a, uh, a hard fall,

13:15.925 --> 13:20.800
and a-a bum shoulder, and
a, uh, a girl named Faye.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.762
I, uh, I'm gonna try this again.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.381
Wait, you-you can
read sheet music?

13:37.425 --> 13:39.862
No. But, uh, I can read a room.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.691
How about I help you out,

13:42.734 --> 13:44.475
and you teach me a little?

13:44.519 --> 13:46.173
I get a free piano lesson,

13:46.216 --> 13:49.829
and you don't, like, face-plant
in front of a whole school?

13:51.439 --> 13:52.875
Uh, all right.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.530
You know you didn't have
to do all this, right?

13:55.573 --> 13:58.533
I know, but wanted to
see your life here.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.622
And I'm pretty sure the
only Sacred Heart event

14:00.665 --> 14:02.624
I've been to was
a bomb scare.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.061
D.A. Davidson
Miller. Hi.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.282
Ranger Ramirez.
And Mr. Barnett, right?

14:08.325 --> 14:09.761
- Yeah, yeah.
- I believe our first meeting

14:09.805 --> 14:11.415
was actually
in the principal's office.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.200
- Mm.
- Not my best look.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.202
Not at all.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.681
But I was hoping
to run into you tonight.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.640
- Oh, yeah? Is everything okay?
- Yeah, of course.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.163
I just... I wanted to thank you.

14:20.207 --> 14:23.036
Colton's been telling me
about these, um, escape rooms

14:23.079 --> 14:25.516
Oh.that you're doing,
and I just wish

14:25.560 --> 14:27.301
that anyone would have cared
that much in Thalia.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.650
So, thank you.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.826
He's a star pupil,
this counselor.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.567
Thank you.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.960
Mr. Barnett,
can I see you for a second?

14:34.003 --> 14:35.787
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Hey, listen, I got to go,

14:35.831 --> 14:37.311
but you make sure
you get all good

14:37.354 --> 14:39.530
- and eggnogged-up, okay?
- Right.

14:39.574 --> 14:40.792
- I'll be here.
- All right.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.882
- When you need a breather.
- Of course.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.431
Good to see you,
Danny Boy.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.433
What do you guys want?

15:21.268 --> 15:22.530
You're a long way
from Walker Ranch.

15:22.573 --> 15:23.879
Yeah. Haven't seen you
in a while, Dan.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.055
Yeah, great fences
make great neighbors.

15:29.406 --> 15:32.496
I didn't think we'd,
uh, run into you up here.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.499
I know this is where you
and Denise met, but, uh,

15:35.543 --> 15:37.023
you know, obviously,
she told us

15:37.066 --> 15:38.502
to come up here and
check some stuff out.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.374
Didn't expect to run into you.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.941
Yeah, well, I just thought
I'd surprise her

15:41.984 --> 15:44.073
with some decorations
that we left behind.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.596
You always keep your, uh,

15:45.640 --> 15:47.816
your shotgun next
to your "decorations"?

15:47.859 --> 15:50.471
Oh, yeah. It's right next
to my second amendment.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.038
I got nothing to hide.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.692
And in case you forgot,
um, I had a little run-in

15:54.736 --> 15:57.086
with, uh, a member
of Serano's crew,

15:57.130 --> 15:59.001
saving your baby brother.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.525
I'm just trying
to protect our families,

16:01.569 --> 16:04.137
- that's all.
- Boyd McNeil says otherwise.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.878
You're gonna take advice
- from a local felon?
- Everything else he told us

16:06.922 --> 16:08.445
checks out. And now,

16:08.489 --> 16:10.665
here we find you,
loaded for bear.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.972
Just help us
understand that, Dan.

16:13.015 --> 16:17.454
You two will stop at nothing
to defame my family.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.588
See, what I'm thinking is

16:20.631 --> 16:23.373
maybe Denise leaves her
work laptop unattended,

16:23.417 --> 16:25.201
you see the routes
for the evidence van,

16:25.245 --> 16:26.376
and you think to yourself,

16:26.420 --> 16:27.725
"Maybe I'll have some fun

16:27.769 --> 16:29.423
like I used to with Boyd."

16:29.466 --> 16:30.772
Are you-are you
hearing yourself?

16:30.815 --> 16:33.601
Or maybe it is about
paying off Serano.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.255
I mean, like you said, you did

16:35.298 --> 16:36.778
kill one of his lieutenants.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.259
Is Northside Nation
squeezing you?

16:39.302 --> 16:41.174
You can tell us, Dan.

16:41.217 --> 16:44.394
I just can't figure you out.

16:44.438 --> 16:48.355
Must be that perfect hair.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.097
Well, you just got
to put in the time

16:51.140 --> 16:52.968
and find the right product.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.014
You'll get there.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.756
Now, am I under arrest,
or am I free to go?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.367
Free to go.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.282
Yeah. Please, enjoy
the rest... Liam.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.936
Excuse me.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.726
Uh, uh, uh,
excuse me,

17:11.769 --> 17:14.816
ladies, mind if I steal
this queso queen over here?

17:16.252 --> 17:18.733
You saved me.
I was one step away

17:18.776 --> 17:20.561
from volunteering
to take the kids

17:20.604 --> 17:23.085
to Barton Springs
to hunt polliwogs.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.305
- Is that even a thing?
- Yeah.

17:25.348 --> 17:28.308
Cornered by the
- science teachers, huh?
- Ugh.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.744
Guess you are really
trying to get a taste

17:29.787 --> 17:31.311
of my life here
at Sacred Heart.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.008
Yeah,
and all I keep hearing about

17:33.052 --> 17:34.749
is my badass boyfriend Barnett.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.012
Hey, it's hard to argue
with the fans.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.798
How exactly did you become
big counselor on campus

17:40.842 --> 17:42.800
in only one semester?

17:42.844 --> 17:46.108
Honestly, uh... I just said yes

17:46.152 --> 17:48.763
to every request
when you were under.

17:48.806 --> 17:52.071
Exam proctor,
parking lot attendant, you know?

17:53.246 --> 17:56.118
Wow, you really threw
yourself in it, huh?

17:56.162 --> 18:00.122
Yeah. Anything to get my mind
off what you had done.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.517
I'm sorry. I mean, what you...
what you were doing.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.996
- What I had done?
- No, no, no, no.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.346
Mick, that's not what I meant.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.304
Trey, no. Today is about
finally being honest.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.567
If that's something
you're holding in,

18:10.611 --> 18:12.003
I need you to
trust me with it.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.920
Trey, do you blame me
for going under?

18:15.964 --> 18:18.706
Of course not.
But look, how am I not supposed

18:18.749 --> 18:20.403
to overthink the timing?

18:20.447 --> 18:22.144
I-I don't know what that means.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.363
Really?

18:23.406 --> 18:24.712
Mom Brunch.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.540
Talking about kids.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.324
Things got real, Mick.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.197
And-and-and, look, I know

18:31.240 --> 18:33.938
you've always said that
you were new to commitment.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.245
But then I find out
that you were engaged.

18:36.289 --> 18:39.770
So maybe it's more about
c-commitment to me.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.817
I...You understand
chain of command, Trey.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.819
I took an order
from my captain.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.212
Oh, he ordered it?

18:46.255 --> 18:48.127
N... He...

18:48.170 --> 18:50.259
Well, he thought
- I'd be good for it.
- Yeah.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.869
So you decided.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.612
That fork in the road
that you mentioned--

18:55.656 --> 18:58.572
you know
I'm on the wrong side of it.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.835
I need some air.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.587
Ma'am.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.154
Gentlemen. Sure.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.113
Great, thank you.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.636
Uh,

19:19.680 --> 19:21.856
biggest burger you got. And?

19:21.899 --> 19:23.945
- The same, please.
- Two.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.642
You got it.
- Coming up.
- All right,

19:25.686 --> 19:27.818
I guess we should probably
loop in Denise.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.299
Maybe we should
get on the same page first.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.693
Okay. Yeah, sure, great.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.260
Uh, yeah, everything...

19:34.303 --> 19:36.218
Everything is not good, okay?

19:36.262 --> 19:38.177
I've been trying
to stay calm about this,

19:38.220 --> 19:40.483
but...But...

19:40.527 --> 19:41.876
but what?

19:41.919 --> 19:43.530
Look, I understand all that

19:43.573 --> 19:46.272
that family has been through,
but it is hard to walk away

19:46.315 --> 19:49.710
from that conversation with Dan
and not feel like...

19:50.493 --> 19:52.278
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

19:52.321 --> 19:53.627
Not feel like what?

19:53.670 --> 19:54.671
Like we are living
next to a criminal.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.630
A violent one, at that.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.589
Okay, I think we're still a few
steps away from knowing that.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.548
- You heard Boyd.
- Ah.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.898
Dan Miller gave him that scar
when they were teens,

20:03.941 --> 20:06.379
just like the one
- Clint West gave me.
- Okay.

20:06.422 --> 20:09.033
I understand your concern that
Dan Miller is living next door

20:09.077 --> 20:10.948
to us all of a sudden...Don't do that.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.821
Don't do that. Not when it comes
- to the safety of our family.
- Yeah, but...

20:13.864 --> 20:15.518
I get what you're going through.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.041
No, you don't.

20:18.391 --> 20:22.438
Because when I hear
a gunshot now, Cordell,

20:22.482 --> 20:24.266
I look down to see

20:24.310 --> 20:27.051
where the bullet is in me.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.752
Well, um...

20:33.536 --> 20:35.930
...I'm sorry.

20:35.973 --> 20:39.194
I-I had no idea. I'm sorry.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.328
Um, I think you should
talk to someone.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.851
I think it could help.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.941
I just need you
to trust me here.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.248
I have a bad feeling about this.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.901
I-I trust you.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.643
But I need you to trust me.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.906
I am not gonna let Serano walk

20:55.950 --> 20:57.778
because of some evidence truck.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.345
We are going to find it.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.695
And if Dan Miller is involved,

21:01.738 --> 21:04.306
any way,
shape or form,

21:04.350 --> 21:05.655
we are gonna put him away

21:05.699 --> 21:08.354
- for a long, long time. Okay?
- Hey, Gale.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.790
- Hey.
- Great.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.618
Heads up.

21:11.661 --> 21:12.706
Oh.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.229
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.013
I'm glad you boys made it
to my favorite place in town.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.624
- Yeah.
- You absolutely cannot leave

21:17.667 --> 21:20.104
without trying a piece
of the pecan pumpkin pie.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.932
Megan back there
is an absolute wonder.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.325
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

21:23.369 --> 21:27.590
Um, Cordell, could-could
we have a word? Alone?

21:28.591 --> 21:31.072
Sure, of course. Yeah, just...You know what?

21:31.115 --> 21:34.510
Let me...
I-I need some air anyway.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.426
Gale.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.181
Safety first.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.357
Never know
if anyone shady's around.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.358
Hmm.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.940
- Here you go.
- Um, so...

22:56.984 --> 22:59.987
Dan, um, told me about your
and William's quest here.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.685
This-this theory. Right?

23:02.729 --> 23:05.688
Yeah, yeah, it's not a,
not a quest or a theory,

23:05.732 --> 23:07.864
we're investigating a crime.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.432
Just following facts.
You know... A-A crime, mind you,

23:10.476 --> 23:13.522
that your daughter Denise
asked us to look into.

23:13.566 --> 23:16.133
Well, the good news
is you're done.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.439
This is the address

23:17.483 --> 23:21.530
of a hardware store
down the street.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.489
Now, the, uh, clerk there
said he sold

23:23.532 --> 23:26.448
blowtorches to three meth heads
yesterday.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.363
Yeah.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.974
How does this clear Dan?
I mean, I got to say,

23:31.018 --> 23:32.454
your son-in-law, uh,

23:32.498 --> 23:34.935
stiff-armed every single
one of our questions.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.284
He's-he's hiding something.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.503
From us, obviously, but,

23:37.546 --> 23:39.505
- you know, maybe from you, too?
- Okay,

23:39.548 --> 23:42.377
I think you'll find
that Dan doesn't really cavort

23:42.421 --> 23:45.336
- with these sort of meth heads.
- All right,

23:45.380 --> 23:47.687
call it neighborly intuition,

23:47.730 --> 23:50.603
but I-I get the feeling
that's only half true.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.562
Can you help me
understand why

23:53.606 --> 23:56.347
you are up here
with your son-in-law right now?

23:59.786 --> 24:02.876
Dan screwed up last week,
with Denise.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.182
All right? He-he missed
a counseling session

24:05.226 --> 24:06.357
with some bonehead excuse.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.924
My daughter was not happy,

24:07.968 --> 24:10.536
and Colton heard, you know, the
whole fight and-and I just...

24:10.579 --> 24:12.494
The poor boy.
So Dan comes up here

24:12.538 --> 24:15.410
for, you know,
"decorations," but...

24:15.454 --> 24:17.412
really, it was just
to-to sleep here.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.284
Blow off some steam
at the pool hall.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.590
Maybe talk to old friends.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.114
Denise thinks he's staying
at the Driskill.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.638
- Okay.
- Yeah.

24:25.681 --> 24:28.162
I-Is that supposed
to be an alibi?

24:28.989 --> 24:30.556
It's just the full truth.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.471
Hmm.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.516
Got to say, Gale,
I-I feel like you're...

24:34.560 --> 24:36.953
you're driving towards
an ask here.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.520
Just towards your discretion.

24:39.782 --> 24:43.830
Cordell, it took a lot
for Denise to go to counseling.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.658
- Right.
- To try to bring up
all that with Dan.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.660
That's the problem
with your generation,

24:47.703 --> 24:48.922
you know, just...

24:48.965 --> 24:50.750
always ready to toss in
the towel, you know?

24:50.793 --> 24:51.838
Separation, divorce.

24:51.881 --> 24:54.797
I bet even you and Emily
considered it,

24:54.841 --> 24:56.669
God rest her soul.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.802
We're talking about
you and yours here, Gale.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.021
I know.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.370
It's just, it's...

25:02.413 --> 25:05.504
it's a easy out, is all.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.681
Sure. Sure.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.161
Uh...

25:11.205 --> 25:14.338
and if this checks out...

25:14.382 --> 25:16.036
I could find my way to keeping

25:16.079 --> 25:18.560
Dan's bachelor weekend
between us, but,

25:18.604 --> 25:20.257
Gale,

25:20.301 --> 25:22.521
if you screw me over on this,

25:22.564 --> 25:26.176
then my whole peacemaker bit
is over.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.701
And you won't like
what comes next.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.749
Good day.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.856
All damn day.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.858
This poor excuse of a lighter
- just ain't cutting it.
- Dude,

25:55.902 --> 25:57.991
that's what happens when you
make us ball on a budget, Barry.

25:58.034 --> 26:00.689
Don't blame us
if Serano's unhappy.

26:04.171 --> 26:07.217
- Barry McNeil! Texas
Rangers. Open up.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.568
Got some questions for you.
And a warrant.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.588
Hey! Don't move!

26:31.938 --> 26:33.069
Hey!

26:33.113 --> 26:35.332
Don't-don't.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.770
Drop it.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.774
You first.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.082
What? You afraid?

26:46.126 --> 26:47.562
Am I afraid?

26:52.088 --> 26:54.134
All right. Bring it.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.504
You know...

27:18.158 --> 27:19.812
...you could've just
dropped the torch.

27:19.855 --> 27:22.249
All right.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.645
Come on! Here
we go. Come on.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.345
Smart enough to steal it,

27:31.388 --> 27:33.173
but not smart enough
to get inside.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.827
That is the real
Christmas miracle.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.785
Is it ever.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.657
Can't believe I'm about
to say this, but, uh,

27:38.700 --> 27:40.180
how about Gale Davidson?

27:41.616 --> 27:43.618
Her information checks out.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.837
Yeah, it did.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.754
Uh, good thing we took
our blinders off, yeah?

27:49.798 --> 27:51.147
But I think

27:51.191 --> 27:52.714
we may owe Dan Miller
an apology.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.151
Let's not get too charitable.

27:55.978 --> 27:58.328
Hey. Uh, if we leave now,

27:58.372 --> 28:00.679
we can get one of them
Douglas firs.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.463
Make it home
in time for caroling?

28:02.506 --> 28:05.422
I know you want to hear me
sing. I've been practicing.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.875
Hang on.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.750
What the hell?

28:28.794 --> 28:31.274
Is that the Davidsons?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.626
That's the Davidsons.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.628
Hang tight. I'll be right back.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.674
Just gonna go see what
this is all about.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.763
Cordi, just g... keep driving.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.896
- Y... What?
- Please drive.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.375
Well... What's going on here?

28:45.419 --> 28:47.987
Nothing.
Nothing's going on. Just...

28:49.162 --> 28:50.859
I m-I made a call,
but you-you just k...

28:50.903 --> 28:52.600
if you just keep driving,
because...Wait, wait, okay, hold on.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.558
Back up, back up. What
are you talking about?

28:54.602 --> 28:55.908
- You called someone?
- You have to understand

28:55.951 --> 28:57.170
that Dan was dangerous.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.259
He was a threat.
And you said it yourself,

28:59.302 --> 29:01.435
you agreed with me,
that we just needed more, right?

29:01.478 --> 29:04.394
I-I said, I said you should
talk to someone.

29:04.438 --> 29:07.180
- Dan is innocent.
- Right. I know that now.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.225
Okay, Liam,
w-w... hold on.

29:09.269 --> 29:12.359
Please tell me you-you didn't...

29:12.402 --> 29:14.100
I was safe, okay?

29:14.143 --> 29:16.232
There were no cameras.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.060
- No one saw me.
- No cam-no cameras?

29:18.104 --> 29:19.975
What does that mean?

29:20.019 --> 29:24.937
I can't believe
I'm about to ask you this. Um...

29:24.980 --> 29:26.547
Don't lie to me.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.157
Did you

29:28.201 --> 29:31.813
call in a false report
on Dan's car

29:31.857 --> 29:33.467
to get around a warrant?

29:33.510 --> 29:35.251
Because if you did...

29:35.295 --> 29:37.253
Yes, I did.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.820
You did.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.046
Wow.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.788
That's bad. I mean, this is bad.
This is real bad.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.660
No, I can, I can f...
I can fix...No, you can't fix this.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.053
- I can fix this.
- Don't try and...

29:54.096 --> 29:55.576
This is not something
you come back from.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.186
This is a line you do not cross.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.581
This is the end of a
career, Liam. Your career.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.017
So don't fix this.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.976
You can't fix this,
so please don't try. Okay?

30:04.019 --> 30:05.412
You've done enough.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.427
Hey.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.168
I think I got this whole
"being your literal

30:22.211 --> 30:23.517
right hand" thing down pat.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.172
- Yeah?
- You ready to show
'em what we got?

30:26.215 --> 30:27.869
H-How are you so calm?

30:27.913 --> 30:29.610
We're gonna own the stage.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.481
Hey, don't worry.

30:31.525 --> 30:32.700
I'll make you look good.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.354
Hey-hey, dude,
before you go out.

30:34.397 --> 30:37.226
About that, uh, haymaker
earlier this year.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.706
I misjudged you, man.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.360
It was actually fun
hitting the keys today.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.492
How about this--
tomorrow we, uh,

30:42.536 --> 30:44.320
upgrade from neighbors
to friends?

30:44.364 --> 30:46.714
Uh, maybe we see
how tonight goes first,

30:46.757 --> 30:48.890
you know, but, um,

30:48.934 --> 30:51.501
yeah.
Yeah, I could be into that.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.329
Let's rockLet's do this.

30:53.373 --> 30:55.070
some holiday carols!

31:40.115 --> 31:43.205
Hey, Denise, can I steal you
- for a sec?
- Yeah.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.430
You seeing those two up there?

31:50.473 --> 31:53.302
The kids are finally making
an example for our families.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.217
'Tis the season.

31:55.261 --> 31:56.958
Look, I heard the good news
about the truck,

31:57.002 --> 31:59.569
but, um, Colton's still playing.
Can this wait?

32:00.570 --> 32:01.528
No, it can't.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.617
Can I talk to you privately?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.271
- Please.
- Yeah.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.773
I ran a warrant

32:29.817 --> 32:31.079
- on Dan, okay?
- On Dan?

32:31.123 --> 32:32.428
Look, 'cause Gale...Why did you...

32:32.472 --> 32:34.648
- Why would you do that?
- Because I thought...

32:34.691 --> 32:36.998
- Dad, you made it.
- Come on.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.435
They're about to
- light the tree.
- Hey. Yeah, yeah, of course.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.307
Yeah, yeah, I-I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.445
Merry Christmas, y'all!

32:49.489 --> 32:51.099
What?

32:51.143 --> 32:52.840
Here comes Santa Claus!

32:52.883 --> 32:55.364
Oh, my God.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.018
Who wants presents?

32:57.062 --> 32:59.020
I know y'all do.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.282
But first--
are you ready?

33:00.326 --> 33:02.589
Are you ready?

33:02.632 --> 33:05.026
Light 'em up!

33:11.728 --> 33:12.991
I did that.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.123
- Dad, did you know about this?
- Did I...

33:15.167 --> 33:17.343
did I know about
the-the Salty Santa bit?

33:17.386 --> 33:18.518
Yeah, of course.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.041
Your granddaddy-- he knew

33:20.085 --> 33:21.477
that it was a hard semester,
and, uh,

33:21.521 --> 33:23.088
you know, he and I
wanted to surprise you.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.960
And, frankly, I-I wanted
to see him in that wig.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.962
Well, since you're, uh,

33:28.006 --> 33:30.791
you're feeling real festive
right now,

33:30.834 --> 33:32.532
maybe, um,

33:32.575 --> 33:36.057
what I want for Christmas
is a-a pass.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.711
You want, you want

33:37.754 --> 33:39.321
a-a pass, for what?

33:40.540 --> 33:41.628
I might have

33:41.671 --> 33:44.805
fallen through
the-the Davidsons' barn.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.502
Uh... the Davidsons' barn?

33:46.546 --> 33:47.634
Yeah.

33:47.677 --> 33:49.418
Why did you go
to the Davidsons' barn?

33:50.289 --> 33:53.422
Well, I had to see about a girl.

33:56.425 --> 33:59.037
Right. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. All right.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.561
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- Okay.

34:01.604 --> 34:02.953
Okay, that hurts.

34:14.661 --> 34:17.664
Wasn't supposed to
snow tonight, was it?

34:17.707 --> 34:21.450
Lot of stuff wasn't supposed
to happen tonight, I think.

34:23.974 --> 34:25.976
Look, hey.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.197
I know I stepped in it today.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.591
But I've been thinking, and...

34:32.635 --> 34:33.941
...I'm glad I did it.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.509
That I stepped in it.

34:36.552 --> 34:39.903
Too much has been unsaid
between us lately, Mick.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.644
Are you glad
I told you the truth?

34:41.688 --> 34:46.649
I-I think it raised as many
questions as it answered, but...

34:46.693 --> 34:50.218
yeah, I'm glad.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.617
You totally should
have picked up

34:57.660 --> 34:59.009
when Walker called.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.055
- I really should have.
- Yeah.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.926
Yeah.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.016
But...

35:07.322 --> 35:09.324
...now I know
how you really feel.

35:12.501 --> 35:15.809
Still don't know
what to do with it.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.898
Or how we move forward.

35:19.029 --> 35:22.032
I think we do

35:22.076 --> 35:25.340
Maybe. And...

35:25.384 --> 35:27.951
neither of us wants to say it.

35:40.050 --> 35:43.053
The church painting.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.316
That was where Garrison and I

35:44.359 --> 35:46.405
were supposed to get married.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.585
You've got to know you
were telling me something

35:52.628 --> 35:56.371
the minute that you
hung that up in our home.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.028
I think you're right.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.248
About what you said before.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.946
Neither of us wanting to say it?

36:06.729 --> 36:08.383
But we should.

36:11.865 --> 36:14.563
We should say it.

36:20.265 --> 36:23.355
It wasn't supposed
to snow tonight.

36:23.398 --> 36:27.315
A lot of things weren't
supposed to happen tonight.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.230
Trey.

36:31.101 --> 36:34.192
I need to go home.

36:34.235 --> 36:37.064
Back to San Antonio.

36:37.107 --> 36:40.023
I need to figure out
how I got here.

36:41.155 --> 36:44.158
Otherwise I don't think
I can make it back.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.222
I love you.

38:20.515 --> 38:22.343
- Oh, God.

38:22.387 --> 38:25.041
Please tell me
there's something I can say

38:25.085 --> 38:27.000
to make you change your mind.

38:32.310 --> 38:37.140
Have you ever spent so much time
trying to prove you could

38:37.184 --> 38:39.534
do what everyone says
you couldn't...

38:40.840 --> 38:42.363
...you just lost track

38:42.407 --> 38:44.060
of why you're doing it at all?

38:44.104 --> 38:46.193
You've done it, Ramirez.
You're doing it.

38:46.236 --> 38:47.977
It's not easy,
but you're doing it.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.024
Hey.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.200
Cap. Hey.

38:53.243 --> 38:55.028
Thought I might
find you here. Uh...

38:55.071 --> 38:57.770
I-I talked to Trey.

38:57.813 --> 39:02.992
And, uh...

39:05.038 --> 39:07.954
If-if this is, uh... happening,

39:07.997 --> 39:09.477
then I-I think I should say...

39:09.521 --> 39:10.913
We don't need
to say goodbye.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.785
We don't need to do that.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.440
Well, I need to say this. Uh...

39:19.400 --> 39:21.620
When you met me...

39:23.186 --> 39:27.277
...I had just come back
from being under, and...

39:28.322 --> 39:29.454
...that takes a toll.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.020
I know.

39:31.064 --> 39:34.372
You helped me, Micki.

39:34.415 --> 39:37.157
You helped me m-more
than I can explain.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.985
And I...

39:39.028 --> 39:42.031
should have reached out
to you more.

39:42.075 --> 39:46.819
No. I'm trying to look
at the positive here.

39:47.907 --> 39:50.039
Everything that happened...

39:51.127 --> 39:54.870
...it gave me this clarity.

39:56.394 --> 40:01.660
I want to love my job,
this place.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.533
I used to.

40:09.972 --> 40:12.279
Gentles, do not reprehend.

40:12.322 --> 40:13.933
If you pardon,

40:13.976 --> 40:16.762
we will mend.

40:17.893 --> 40:21.593
Give me your hands
if we be friends.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.467
Okay, I-I don't know
what y'all are doing right now.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.867
Thank you for taking
a chance on me, sir.

40:34.910 --> 40:38.087
It wasn't a chance, Micki,
it was...

40:38.131 --> 40:39.828
one of the smartest things
I ever did.

40:39.872 --> 40:41.526
Yeah.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.615
I just hope I wasn't
a disappointment...

40:43.658 --> 40:46.139
Don't even finish that sentence.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.882
Door's always open, all right?

40:52.798 --> 40:54.364
And you'll...

40:54.408 --> 40:57.542
you'll always
be my family, Beau.

40:59.587 --> 41:02.503
Back at you, Flor.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.741
It's a privilege.
