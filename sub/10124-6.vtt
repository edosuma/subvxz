00:14.200 --> 00:17.900
OCTOBER THE 31st,
ALL HALLOWS EVE,

00:17.900 --> 00:21.767
I, CORY MATTHEWS,
LEAVE THIS JOURNAL
SO THAT THOSE WHO KNEW ME

00:21.767 --> 00:24.667
CAN UNDERSTAND
MY TERRIBLE FATE.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.500
FOR TONIGHT,
AT PRECISELY 9:00,

00:27.500 --> 00:28.500
8:00 CENTRAL...

00:28.500 --> 00:30.200
WHEN THE MOON SHINES FULL,

00:30.200 --> 00:34.000
I WILL BECOME
THE MOST TERRIFYING
OF ALL CREATURES--

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
THE WEREWOLF.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.867
[WOLF HOWLS]

00:38.867 --> 00:39.934
CORY...

00:39.934 --> 00:41.934
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY DUSTER?

00:44.233 --> 00:47.567
A-OOOH!

00:55.667 --> 01:00.066
8:35, I'M DROOLING
MORE THAN USUAL.

01:00.066 --> 01:02.700
THE CHANGE INTO WOLFDOM
IS UPON ME.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.767
HEY, COR. YOU READY
FOR THE HALLOWEEN PARTY?

01:06.767 --> 01:09.400
PLEASE. I HAVE NO TIME
FOR SUCH THINGS.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.100
COME ON.
GUESS WHO I'M GOING AS.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.500
O.K., I'LL GIVE YOU
A HINT.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.400
[IMITATING CORY]
WOW, SHAWN, I WISH
I WAS AS COOL AS YOU.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.200
I'M SURE
I HAVE NO IDEA.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.300
I'M GOING AS YOU.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.200
PRETTY LIFELIKE, HUH?

01:25.200 --> 01:26.834
SO WHERE'S YOUR COSTUME?

01:26.834 --> 01:28.200
I'M NOT GOING.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.600
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.567
I HAVE TO STAY HERE,
ALONE.

01:31.567 --> 01:34.867
LOCKED IN MY ROOM
WHERE NO ONE CAN SEE ME.

01:34.867 --> 01:38.600
WHAT ABOUT TOPANGA?
SHE'S MEETING US HERE.
REMEMBER?

01:38.600 --> 01:40.767
I TOLD HER
IT WASN'T SAFE.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.233
I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY ACTIONS.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.000
ONLY EVIL WILL COME
FROM TONIGHT.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.200
GOING TO MAKE YOUR MOVE,
HUH?

01:48.200 --> 01:51.233
IF I DO, IT'LL BE
ON ALL FOURS.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.834
I GOT TO TELL SOMEBODY.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.567
I AM ONE OF THE UNDEAD
CREATURES OF THE NIGHT.

01:55.567 --> 01:58.300
YOU CAN'T FOOL
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.567
SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU,
ISN'T IT?

02:00.567 --> 02:04.000
WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO TELL YOU
IS SO BIZARRE

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
NO ONE
IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD BELIEVE IT.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.967
THEN I'M YOUR GUY.

02:08.967 --> 02:11.300
IT ALL STARTED
LAST NIGHT.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.200
I WOULDN'T BE TAKING OUT
THAT GARBAGE
IF I WERE YOU.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.700
I HAD TO.
IT WAS STARTING TO MOVE.

02:21.700 --> 02:22.934
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

02:22.934 --> 02:26.100
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.
I LIVE UPSTAIRS.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.600
IT SEEMS
THAT A WOLF ESCAPED

02:27.600 --> 02:29.800
FROM
THE PHILADELPHIA ZOO.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.934
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE
THAT IT MAY BE SOMEWHERE
IN OUR AREA.

02:33.934 --> 02:36.033
A WOLF IN THE BURBS?

02:36.033 --> 02:39.600
YES. PROBABLY LOOKING
FOR BETTER SCHOOLS.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.867
HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR GARBAGE BACK INSIDE?

02:42.867 --> 02:45.867
WOLVES HAVE A KEEN SENSE
OF SMELL.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.834
THE GARBAGE
WOULD ONLY ATTRACT THEM.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.400
YOUR PLAN
IS TO LURE THEM
INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM?

02:51.400 --> 02:54.800
AS ACTING HEAD
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WATCH,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.100
I HAVE DULY WARNED YOU.

02:57.100 --> 03:01.300
<i>AND THAT'S WHEN I HEARD </i>
<i>THE RUSTLING.  </i>
[RUSTLING]

03:01.300 --> 03:02.200
HELLO.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.100
ANYBODY THERE?

03:07.400 --> 03:09.834
ERIC?

03:09.834 --> 03:12.033
ERIC AND A GIRL?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.967
MORGAN?

03:15.967 --> 03:17.934
OH, BOY.
YOU'RE NOT MORGAN.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.600
AAH!

03:24.967 --> 03:28.100
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU WERE BITTEN BY A WOLF.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.467
WHAT ELSE
COULD IT HAVE BEEN? LOOK AT THE
BITE.

03:30.467 --> 03:33.300
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.500
EVERYBODY KNOWS
WEREWOLF BITES
HEAL OVERNIGHT.

03:36.500 --> 03:41.100
WOW! THEN YOU'RE COVERED
WITH THEM.

03:41.100 --> 03:44.133
SO YOU'RE REALLY
TURNING INTO A WEREWOLF?

03:44.133 --> 03:47.667
I DIDN'T THINK SO
UNTIL I WOKE UP
THIS MORNING.

03:47.667 --> 03:50.834
ERIC,
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
MAY SHOCK YOU.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.000
THEN PUT A TOWEL ON.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.500
O.K. LOOK.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.467
OH, MY GOD!
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
AT ALL!

03:59.467 --> 04:01.300
DON'T TOY WITH ME.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.100
IT'S ALL OVER ME.
I'VE GOT HAIR,
HUGE AMOUNTS.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.967
YOU'RE RIGHT. WHERE?

04:05.967 --> 04:07.367
MY CHIN, MY CHEST,

04:07.367 --> 04:10.367
AND OTHER PLACES
I DON'T SEE
WHERE HAVING HAIR ON

04:10.367 --> 04:11.500
IS REALLY
GOING TO HELP ME.

04:11.500 --> 04:15.467
YOU'RE RIGHT. LOOK.
LITTLE WISPY HAIRS.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.734
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
PUBERTY.

04:17.734 --> 04:19.567
AT LEAST THAT'S
ONE EXPLANATION.

04:19.567 --> 04:22.467
ERIC,
DON'T START WITH ME.
I'M ON THE EDGE.

04:22.467 --> 04:25.200
IT'S JUST
WHAT YOU TOLD ME
LAST NIGHT

04:25.200 --> 04:27.200
ABOUT BEING BITTEN
BY THIS WOLF.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.800
IT MIGHT NOT
HAVE BEEN A WOLF.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.867
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T
AN ORDINARY WOLF.

04:31.867 --> 04:34.400
ONE NIGHT YOU'RE BITTEN
BY A WOLF,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.200
THE NEXT DAY
YOU'RE THE CHIA BOY.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.934
I DON'T WANT
TO ALARM YOU,

04:38.934 --> 04:41.133
BUT I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE TURNING INTO...

04:44.600 --> 04:46.667
A WEREWOLF.

04:46.667 --> 04:50.133
COME ON.
WHOEVER HEARD OF A KID
TURING INTO A WEREWOLF?

04:50.133 --> 04:53.300
NOBODY, EXCEPT
THE MOST WIDELY READ
NEWSPAPER IN AMERICA.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.367
READ THIS.

04:54.367 --> 04:59.367
"SIAMESE TWINS
EAT THEIR WAY
TO FREEDOM"?

04:59.367 --> 05:00.767
OH, NO. ABOVE THE FOLD.

05:00.767 --> 05:04.767
"TEENAGE WEREWOLF PROBED
BY TOP SCIENTISTS."

05:04.767 --> 05:07.000
KID GOT BITTEN BY SOMETHING

05:07.000 --> 05:08.367
HE DIDN'T GET
A GOOD LOOK AT.

05:08.367 --> 05:09.767
KIND OF LIKE YOU.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.300
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

05:12.300 --> 05:13.700
NOTHING. NOTHING.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.800
HE JUST TURNED INTO...

05:17.800 --> 05:19.900
A WEREWOLF.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.100
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.

05:21.100 --> 05:24.033
JASON'S COUSIN
MET A GUY AT A PARTY

05:24.033 --> 05:26.600
WHO KNOWS A GUY
WHO SAW THE THING.

05:26.600 --> 05:30.000
THEY KEEP IT
IN A SECRET STEEL-WALLED ROOM
IN THE PENTAGON.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.500
IT'S ALREADY KILLED
SIX GUARDS.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.934
EVERY FULL MOON
THEY OPEN THIS LITTLE DOOR
AND FEED IT LIVE RATS.

05:37.133 --> 05:39.000
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.200
I AM NOT A WEREWOLF.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.000
THEY SAY
THE FIRST SIGN'S
DENIAL.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.500
CORY, BREAKFAST!

05:46.500 --> 05:48.100
I MADE YOU
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.967
MM-MMM.
BIG STEAMING BOWL
OF RATS.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.133
CORY.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.567
ALL RIGHT.
I'M A HAIRY MESS.

05:58.567 --> 06:02.867
GET OUT YOUR EPILADY
AND JUST DO ME.

06:02.867 --> 06:05.400
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY
DON'T FORGET YOUR LUNCH.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.000
IT'S O.K.
I'LL KILL SOMETHING
AT SCHOOL.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.200
I SENSE
THERE'S SOMETHING
ON YOUR MIND.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.400
IT'S JUST
THIS MATH PROBLEM

06:13.400 --> 06:18.600

06:24.100 --> 06:27.133
IS THIS ABOUT
THE WOLF THAT ESCAPED?

06:27.133 --> 06:28.700
COULD BE.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.233

DON'T EXIST.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.367

AS YOU GET OLDER,

06:33.834 --> 06:39.033
YOU'LL LEARN
HOW TO SEPARATE
MYTH FROM REALITY.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.900
ONE OF OUR
SODA DISTRIBUTORS

06:42.900 --> 06:45.400
HEARD ABOUT THIS GUY
WHO ROBBED A JEWELER'S

06:45.400 --> 06:47.867
AND MADE OFF WITH FIVE
DIAMOND RINGS.

06:47.867 --> 06:50.300

IN FIVE CANS OF SODA.

THAN JUST HAIR.

NEW URGES.

TO SMASH HEADS WITH
HIS BASEBALL BAT?

YOU GOT IT BAD.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.300
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW BAD
UNTIL LUNCHTIME

07:28.300 --> 07:31.233
WHEN I HAD
THIS STRANGE CRAVING
FOR A SNACK.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.834
ANY SPECIAL FLAVORS?

07:37.834 --> 07:40.734
WE GOT BUCKET OF BLOOD.
THAT'S LIKE STRAWBERRY.

07:40.734 --> 07:44.967
WE GOT BUCKET OF GUTS.
THAT'S MORE OR LESS
CHOCOLATE.

07:44.967 --> 07:48.300
WE GOT SMASHED
AND SEVERED INTESTINES.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.400
I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.900
CAN YOU MIX
THE BLOOD AND GUTS?

NO.

SHOOT!

09:33.734 --> 09:36.500
ALL RIGHT, WOLFIE,
LISTEN.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.500
YOUR BODY'S ABOUT TO GO
THROUGH MANY CHANGES.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.133
WHAT KIND OF CHANGES?

09:40.133 --> 09:42.600
YOU WILL DEVELOP
THE APPETITE
OF THE WOLF,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.767

YOU'VE NEVER EATEN
BEFORE.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.600
PLEASE DON'T SAY
HEADCHEESE.

09:46.600 --> 09:50.467

STAR WILL APPEAR
IN YOUR HAND.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.133
WILL IT ITCH?
IF IT'S WOOL--

09:52.133 --> 09:53.767
SHUT UP.

09:54.967 --> 09:56.734
THERE IS MORE,

09:56.734 --> 10:00.100
BUT IT IS
TOO HORRIBLE
TO MENTION.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.834
WHAT ABOUT FOR ANOTHER
5 BUCKS?

10:02.834 --> 10:04.967
I FEEL CHATTY.

10:07.367 --> 10:11.834
THERE IS A GIRL
WHO CARES DEEPLY
FOR YOU,

10:11.834 --> 10:15.133
BUT WHEN THE MADNESS
OF THE WOLF
COMES UPON YOU,

10:15.133 --> 10:17.100
YOU WILL REPAY HER LOVE

10:17.100 --> 10:20.200
BY KILLING HER
IN A GRUESOME,
EVIL MANNER.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.300
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT...

WHO IS LICENSED
BY THE STATE.

YOU'RE NUTTY.

A-OOOH!

21:27.834 --> 21:29.300
YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR GARBAGE
OUTSIDE AGAIN?

21:29.300 --> 21:30.367
WHAT ABOUT THE WOLF?

21:30.367 --> 21:31.400
DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

21:31.400 --> 21:33.600
HE WAS IN THE ZOO
THE WHOLE TIME.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.300
THEY FOUND HIM
IN THE AVIARY
EATING A COCKATOO.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.934
SO HE NEVER REALLY
ESCAPED AT ALL?

21:39.934 --> 21:42.834
FUNNY HOW RUMORS START,
ISN'T IT?

21:44.300 --> 21:45.500
DRAT!

21:45.500 --> 21:48.033
WELL, GOOD NIGHT,
MR. MATTHEWS.

21:48.033 --> 21:50.567
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:50.567 --> 21:51.700
NO WOLF?

21:51.700 --> 21:54.000
WELL, THEN, WHAT WAS...

21:56.033 --> 21:57.200
IT'S YOU AGAIN, ISN'T IT?

21:57.200 --> 22:00.300
COME HERE,
YOU CREATURE OF THE NIGHT.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.500
COME OUT, YOU DEMON BEAST.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.800
COME OUT!

22:03.800 --> 22:06.400
A RABBIT?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.834
A FUZZY, CUDDLY RABBIT.

22:10.834 --> 22:14.600
I GOT ALL WORKED UP
OVER YOU?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.834
[ROAR]

22:15.834 --> 22:17.200
THAT'S BETTER.
