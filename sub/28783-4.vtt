'It's of great concern that the Government

01:07.762 --> 01:10.723
hasn't organised our public services

01:10.773 --> 01:14.416
to cope with all the Eastern
Europeans who are entering the UK.

01:14.467 --> 01:17.748
What do you say we get a take-out
tonight and watch The Bachelor,

01:17.798 --> 01:19.805
like we never left home?

01:21.813 --> 01:24.452
Are you OK? Are you
nervous about something?

01:24.502 --> 01:25.777
I'm not nervous.

01:25.827 --> 01:28.336
Changing schools is the
only constant in my life.

01:29.842 --> 01:30.845
What's that?

01:42.867 --> 01:43.869
What's going on?

01:43.893 --> 01:45.850
Ey up, sir.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.861
An early morning walker found a dead
body by the woods, sir. Shit!

01:48.911 --> 01:50.869
- Sorry, young lady.
- It's OK.

01:50.919 --> 01:51.872
Shit!

01:51.922 --> 01:52.926
Jesus!...!

01:57.944 --> 01:59.901
What the hell do you think you're doing?

01:59.951 --> 02:02.752
- Police. There's been an incident.
- What sort of incident?

02:02.802 --> 02:04.920
I don't care if you found a Bigfoot.

02:04.970 --> 02:06.927
It's the only road into town.

02:06.977 --> 02:09.937
No, it isn't. You go back
that way past the bricklayer's

02:09.988 --> 02:11.784
and you get back on the A52.

02:11.834 --> 02:14.080
- I need you to go back inside.
- I'm not going anywhere.

02:14.104 --> 02:15.960
- I can understand that...
- Get the fuck...

02:16.010 --> 02:17.967
Out of my way, I'm late.

02:18.017 --> 02:19.020
Give me your radio.

02:22.393 --> 02:25.033
A possible obstruction
situation, PC Cobley.

02:25.083 --> 02:27.050
Requesting assistance. Over.

02:28.094 --> 02:30.060
Yeah, you and me both.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.547
Sod it. Let him through.

02:34.597 --> 02:36.201
We're all bets it was a kid now, anyway.

02:36.225 --> 02:38.233
A kid?

02:52.181 --> 02:55.102
I once saw a dog stick
his head out of a sunroof

02:55.152 --> 02:56.105
going under a bridge.

02:56.156 --> 02:57.952
Messy business.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.116
But this lad, there's no...

02:59.166 --> 03:01.174
spatter.

03:02.177 --> 03:04.135
So, he was killed somewhere else,

03:04.185 --> 03:07.145
- then brought here to Dead Man's Wood?
- Someone has a sense of humour.

03:07.196 --> 03:09.514
Well, the walker that
found him weren't laughing.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.161
Is there anything else you can tell me?

03:11.211 --> 03:13.167
Nothing for the moment.

03:13.217 --> 03:16.178
Let's get him out of this, see
if we can't find out who he is.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.714
- It might take a while.
- Why, because his face is smashed in?

03:18.739 --> 03:22.201
Well, that. And the fact that
someone's taken the trouble

03:22.251 --> 03:24.258
to burn off his fingerprints.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.233
And here it is.

03:31.283 --> 03:34.244
Boston Pilgrims Comprehensive.

03:34.294 --> 03:37.255
It doesn't look too bad.
Some interesting graffiti.

03:37.305 --> 03:39.312
"Real eyes realise..."

03:40.316 --> 03:42.113
"real lies."

03:42.163 --> 03:43.277
I don't see it.

03:43.327 --> 03:45.284
- Where...?
- It's over there.

03:45.334 --> 03:47.291
Next to the thumbs up.

03:47.341 --> 03:48.386
That's a penis, Dad.

03:49.710 --> 03:51.306
Terrific.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.313
Can you drop me off round the corner?

03:53.363 --> 03:55.371
I don't want people to see this car.

03:57.378 --> 03:58.381
Sure.

04:15.444 --> 04:16.447
Morning.

04:19.458 --> 04:21.416
She was only in the force ten months.

04:21.466 --> 04:24.426
With zero arrests. And
complaints from the public.

04:24.476 --> 04:27.437
She didn't read a dealer his rights
right. She needs time, is all.

04:27.487 --> 04:28.440
Lydia...

04:28.492 --> 04:30.448
it's the law of the jungle.

04:30.498 --> 04:32.707
And a piece of advice,
never get too attached.

04:33.509 --> 04:35.516
It makes it easier to say goodbye.

05:19.035 --> 05:20.631
Planning on nailing someone up on that,

05:20.681 --> 05:22.317
or is that just for personal use?

05:22.367 --> 05:23.641
No.

05:23.692 --> 05:25.649
No, I'm... I'm making it for the chapel.

05:25.699 --> 05:27.656
I help out.

05:27.707 --> 05:30.667
You know, I sweep up, I sing,

05:30.717 --> 05:32.674
I do readings, whatever they need.

05:32.724 --> 05:34.681
Ray Gilchrist is the name.

05:34.732 --> 05:36.046
Sean Cobley.

05:36.096 --> 05:38.747
I don't sing. I've been asked not to.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.707
So, you own all of this, then, do you?

05:41.757 --> 05:44.768
No, the Lord has blessed me
with stewardship of parts of it.

05:46.776 --> 05:49.737
But when the sun shines, though,
it's a nice spot for a picnic.

05:49.787 --> 05:51.743
Yeah, there was a body found in the woods.

05:51.794 --> 05:54.755
I don't suppose you were
picnicking last night, were you?

05:54.805 --> 05:55.758
No.

05:55.808 --> 05:57.766
Dead Man's Wood.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.181
In the dark, it's for...

06:00.505 --> 06:01.780
braver men than me.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.627
Or women.

06:03.677 --> 06:04.831
Right.

06:04.882 --> 06:07.049
Any woman in particular?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.831
Hey, it's a proper bit of kit, that.

06:15.882 --> 06:18.007
I wouldn't have thought you'd
be able to test the soil

06:18.031 --> 06:19.988
without sticking something
in the ground first.

06:20.038 --> 06:21.532
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...

06:21.582 --> 06:22.857
I'm a police officer.

06:22.907 --> 06:24.914
- Says you.
- Yeah, I was here before.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.875
DC Muriel Yeardsley.

06:27.925 --> 06:29.561
Yeardsley?

06:29.611 --> 06:30.886
Scrane End?

06:30.936 --> 06:32.893
- You know our lot, do you?
- Aye.

06:32.943 --> 06:35.101
I heard a load of lads
are running that farm now.

06:35.151 --> 06:37.952
- Running it into the ground.
- We're not as technologically advanced

06:38.002 --> 06:39.969
as this place, that's for sure.

06:40.972 --> 06:43.290
Erm, the body that was found on your land,

06:43.341 --> 06:44.937
I want to ask you a few questions.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.944
It wasn't found on my land.

06:46.994 --> 06:50.206
It was found in the woods
between my property and theirs.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.970
It's Ray Gilchrist you
should be talking to.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.816
His farm's on the other side of the wood.

06:55.866 --> 06:57.149
Yeah, well, why do you say that?

06:57.173 --> 07:00.184
Because some people don't
care who they hurt. Never did.

07:03.030 --> 07:04.032
Audrey Merrick.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.013
Lisa Cranston, Boston Stump.

07:06.063 --> 07:08.021
Not now, Lisa, right? Audrey is...

07:08.071 --> 07:10.028
Audrey now, is it?

07:10.078 --> 07:12.035
Don't take any notice
of her. She's leaving.

07:12.085 --> 07:13.771
Hey, I'm sorry, I just...

07:15.097 --> 07:17.222
I just thought you wouldn't
want to talk to the press.

07:17.246 --> 07:19.582
Then, why would I have called them?

07:19.632 --> 07:23.326
And unlike you lot, when you do
call them, they actually turn up.

07:27.140 --> 07:30.101
I'd just as well be left alone now.

07:30.151 --> 07:33.112
Eight burglaries. I've
had eight in two years.

07:33.162 --> 07:35.169
And what have the police done? Fuck...

07:37.177 --> 07:40.137
Rural crime costs 2.1 million a year.

07:40.188 --> 07:42.233
At least, according to my
campaign leaflet, it does.

07:42.257 --> 07:44.152
I pledged to help people like her.

07:44.202 --> 07:47.162
And now here she is, eight
burglaries in a year.

07:47.213 --> 07:49.170
Four. It's eight over two years.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.177
Right. And what about the dead lad?

07:51.228 --> 07:53.185
He has all the hallmarks of a gang hit.

07:53.235 --> 07:55.393
Fingerprints burnt off,
face beaten to a pulp.

07:55.443 --> 07:57.199
And she's tricky, so I hear.

07:57.249 --> 07:59.207
And thanks to this, she's
got a real following

07:59.257 --> 08:01.053
with the "string them up" brigade.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.244
And they are hard to placate.

08:02.268 --> 08:05.228
You know, unless you actually
start executing people.

08:05.278 --> 08:07.286
I think she'd benefit from a visit.

08:08.289 --> 08:10.247
Get her on side

08:10.297 --> 08:13.308
and then we can start to spin
this thing in my favour, hey?

08:14.352 --> 08:18.004
Show her the Hixon charm,
Bill. It worked on me.

08:21.337 --> 08:22.741
I'd just as well be left alone now.

08:22.765 --> 08:25.342
Eight burglaries. I've
had eight in two years.

08:25.392 --> 08:28.313
And what have the police done? Fuck all!

08:28.363 --> 08:30.320
I've had so much stuff nicked,

08:30.370 --> 08:32.899
I've had to put security all over my farm.

08:42.615 --> 08:44.371
Mrs Merrick?

08:44.421 --> 08:45.423
Hi. I'd like to...

08:47.272 --> 08:48.385
Careful.

08:48.435 --> 08:50.393
That's electric.

08:50.443 --> 08:51.447
Excuse me!

08:52.450 --> 08:54.458
Let's try this again.

09:05.498 --> 09:07.454
- Mrs Merrick...
- Miss.

09:07.504 --> 09:09.552
Miss Merrick...

09:11.519 --> 09:14.320
I'm Chief Constable Bill Hixon. I
heard about your eight burglaries.

09:14.370 --> 09:15.483
No flies on you.

09:15.533 --> 09:17.491
You only reported two of them.

09:17.541 --> 09:19.225
We can't solve crimes we don't know about.

09:19.249 --> 09:21.738
You can't solve crimes you do know about.

09:22.559 --> 09:24.163
Well, I'd like to look at your property.

09:24.187 --> 09:25.520
Maybe I can help you secure it.

09:25.570 --> 09:26.523
See how they got in.

09:26.574 --> 09:28.581
Help yourself.

09:29.585 --> 09:31.542
You park your mobile on a drainage point.

09:31.592 --> 09:34.553
In two more minutes, you're
going to need a tow truck.

09:57.664 --> 09:58.667
Hixon.

09:58.691 --> 10:00.648
- Sir?
- Hello?

10:00.698 --> 10:01.652
- Sir?
- Who is that?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.658
- It's Muriel.
- Who?

10:03.708 --> 10:04.663
Muriel.

10:04.713 --> 10:07.031
The DNA has come back on
the body from the woods.

10:07.081 --> 10:08.677
It's a local Boston boy.

10:08.727 --> 10:10.203
William Mobury.

10:10.253 --> 10:12.892
He served 18 months for
persistent breaking and entering

10:12.942 --> 10:15.381
on mostly isolated farms.

10:15.431 --> 10:17.710
As for the gangland theory,

10:17.760 --> 10:18.713
he's no known affiliations,

10:18.764 --> 10:21.724
no-one from serious and
organised knows him.

10:21.774 --> 10:23.732
So, it doesn't seem like a gang thing.

10:23.782 --> 10:24.735
You'll have to excuse me, Muriel,

10:24.785 --> 10:27.104
but my life has reached
such a nadir of awfulness

10:27.154 --> 10:29.753
that I cannot tell you who or where I am.

10:29.804 --> 10:31.440
I see, sir.

10:31.490 --> 10:34.200
Good luck with that. Before
you go, I do need to speak...

10:36.829 --> 10:38.837
Rude.

11:14.847 --> 11:17.856
- What's that?
- That's a lovely cup of coffee for you, love.

11:21.868 --> 11:23.874
I only drink tea.

11:30.895 --> 11:34.375
I know how you feel, Miss Merrick.

11:34.425 --> 11:37.865
Will Mobury invaded your home,
he made you feel like a victim.

11:37.915 --> 11:40.874
Now, our farm's been done
a couple of times now.

11:40.924 --> 11:41.878
It's scary.

11:41.928 --> 11:43.773
Are you looking for a hug?

11:51.475 --> 11:52.910
How did it happen?

11:52.960 --> 11:56.761
He come after you, you fought
him back with the shovel?

11:56.811 --> 11:59.930
Yeah, no-one around these
parts would blame you for it.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.986
Nobody from around these parts is.

12:09.369 --> 12:10.963
Right, Audrey...

12:11.014 --> 12:11.966
Come on, back at me.

12:12.016 --> 12:13.973
Audrey!

12:15.226 --> 12:16.981
I'm just saying,

12:17.031 --> 12:19.990
someone shows up at the
house at the crack of night.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.996
I'm there, a woman on my own...

12:22.046 --> 12:22.999
I'd be waiting for them.

12:23.049 --> 12:26.579
Ten of them show up, I'd kill them, too.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.075
Right, I'm off.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.034
Where are you going?

12:35.084 --> 12:38.043
It looks like we've got a
murder weapon off your farm.

12:38.094 --> 12:39.046
I think you'd better sit back down.

12:39.096 --> 12:42.055
If there's anything you
want to say to me right now,

12:42.105 --> 12:44.061
it'd be very helpful
for you going forward,

12:44.111 --> 12:45.715
particularly if it involves some regret.

12:45.739 --> 12:47.544
There is one thing.

12:48.123 --> 12:50.129
- I'm going to need a lift home.
- Sir...

12:51.132 --> 12:53.088
It's pig's blood. The...

12:53.138 --> 12:56.147
- The blood on the shovel, it's pig's.
- The runt was sick.

12:57.150 --> 12:59.105
One bang. Over.

12:59.155 --> 13:01.162
Cheaper than the vet's.

13:09.185 --> 13:11.663
You could have told me
that it wasn't human blood.

13:11.713 --> 13:14.159
You're not the sort that listens.
You're the sort that learns.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.156
You shouldn't be poking around in my life.

13:16.206 --> 13:19.165
If you're looking for a killer, you
need to be looking one place only.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.739
The Gilchrists'.

13:30.288 --> 13:33.257
So, who the hell are the Gilchrists?

13:34.259 --> 13:36.215
Ray Gilchrist.

13:36.265 --> 13:38.222
It turns out Ray has got a record.

13:38.272 --> 13:42.233
He did two years for ABH, cautioned
for other violent offences.

13:42.283 --> 13:44.368
His farm's just on the other
side of Dead Man's Wood.

13:44.392 --> 13:46.607
- So, I reckon there's a finger pointing at him.
- Yeah.

13:46.657 --> 13:48.252
Audrey's.

13:48.302 --> 13:49.615
A piece of work.

13:49.665 --> 13:51.260
She's smart.

13:51.310 --> 13:53.292
She's talking to The Stump,
getting them all riled up.

13:53.317 --> 13:55.401
Now everybody's paying
attention to us. But trust me,

13:55.426 --> 13:57.799
- someone who's working it that hard is guilty.
- So...?

13:57.849 --> 14:00.808
So, why are we looking where
Audrey Merrick wants us to look?

14:00.858 --> 14:03.295
I'm not! I'm following the evidence.

14:03.345 --> 14:06.354
- Where are you off?
- Following the real evidence.

14:07.358 --> 14:08.360
I'm sorry.

14:09.564 --> 14:12.322
Hey, Muriel, I've got
the lad's next-of-kin.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.328
She was the last person he called.

14:14.378 --> 14:16.334
Her name's Freya Mobury.

14:16.384 --> 14:17.788
Go on, what are you waiting for?

14:20.397 --> 14:22.402
- Go on.
- Thank you!

14:33.434 --> 14:36.233
Magda always packs too much.

14:36.283 --> 14:38.399
- Here, have one.
- Thanks.

14:38.449 --> 14:40.405
So, I read the court
records you sent over.

14:40.455 --> 14:41.930
It's a farmers' feud.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.546
These two families have been going
at each other for generations.

14:44.570 --> 14:46.423
The Gilchrists and the Merricks.

14:46.473 --> 14:49.432
They've clogged up court
schedules for years.

14:49.482 --> 14:52.441
In 1982 alone, there were
13 suits and counter suits.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.129
1982...

14:55.179 --> 14:56.453
Nebraska.

14:56.503 --> 14:57.456
Springsteen's best.

14:57.506 --> 15:00.464
- He never toured it.
- What a shame.

15:00.514 --> 15:02.599
With farmers, it's never
about what's on the surface,

15:02.623 --> 15:04.629
it's about bad blood in the soil.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.488
Unless you're one of them, you
will never be able to handle them.

15:08.538 --> 15:10.013
I'll be able to handle them.

15:10.063 --> 15:11.497
Is that right, city boy?

15:11.548 --> 15:16.512
Without gold-plated evidence, these
people will run rings around you.

15:16.562 --> 15:18.518
First of all, I'm not a city boy.

15:18.568 --> 15:20.574
And...

15:22.581 --> 15:24.887
we really don't know
each other that well, do we?

15:29.577 --> 15:30.580
Well...

15:30.604 --> 15:31.557
This was nice.

15:31.607 --> 15:33.563
Next time at yours?

15:33.613 --> 15:34.566
Erm...

15:34.616 --> 15:36.622
Yeah, Kelsey doesn't really know about us.

15:37.624 --> 15:40.102
I meant your office.

15:40.152 --> 15:41.426
Yeah.

15:41.476 --> 15:43.592
I talked to her on the
telephone, you know?

15:43.642 --> 15:44.596
Kelsey?

15:44.646 --> 15:47.604
We had a scintillating conversation.

15:47.654 --> 15:48.968
How did it go?

15:49.018 --> 15:51.616
"Hello? Is Bill Hixon at home?"

15:51.666 --> 15:54.625
"No. He's trying to break
the bicycling record"

15:54.676 --> 15:55.678
"for the Herne Loop."

15:57.684 --> 15:59.640
I think she knows. Don't you?

16:03.702 --> 16:06.018
Look, look, luck. Here comes bugeyes.

16:06.069 --> 16:07.663
She looks like a nun!

16:07.713 --> 16:09.669
Her face is hilarious.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.723
Watch this...

16:13.708 --> 16:14.710
Bitch.

16:14.734 --> 16:17.743
- You just got violated!
- It's not funny.

16:19.789 --> 16:22.708
Don't let them find out who your dad is.

16:22.758 --> 16:24.714
- I saw you get dropped around the back.
- So...

16:24.764 --> 16:26.720
where are the rest of you?

16:26.771 --> 16:29.568
Where I come from, the geeks are
the biggest clique in the school.

16:29.618 --> 16:31.735
- After the jocks.
- I am a jock.

16:31.785 --> 16:34.793
- Yeah, right.
- Check this out.

16:35.797 --> 16:38.806
I practise bokator. It's
a Cambodian martial art.

16:39.808 --> 16:41.815
Who's the dude?

16:46.830 --> 16:48.233
Did he move away or something?

16:48.836 --> 16:50.841
Or something.

17:00.871 --> 17:02.877
Freya Mobury, sister of William?

17:04.561 --> 17:06.887
Bollocks... What's he done?

17:23.940 --> 17:26.948
And the last phone call
Will made was to you.

17:27.928 --> 17:28.931
What did he say?

17:28.955 --> 17:30.478
Erm...

17:31.963 --> 17:33.968
I thought he was at some rave.

17:35.653 --> 17:37.931
He was shouting about sparks
in the sky, the fireworks.

17:37.981 --> 17:40.990
I hung up on him. I...

17:42.353 --> 17:45.794
- I'd like to know, Freya.
- I thought he was tripping.

17:45.845 --> 17:48.210
If I had a pound for every time
Will called me off his tits,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.808
I'd have had enough to get me
and Scott out of here for good.

17:50.859 --> 17:52.173
- Scott?
- Yeah.

17:52.223 --> 17:54.028
He's our kid brother.

17:55.031 --> 17:56.345
He's a good boy.

17:56.395 --> 17:58.993
Easily led. Especially by Will.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.999
And can we speak to Scott?

18:01.050 --> 18:02.002
Yeah.

18:02.052 --> 18:04.058
Sure.

18:05.061 --> 18:07.067
He's not been answering my calls, but...

18:10.076 --> 18:12.082
God...

18:20.082 --> 18:21.084
Hey.

18:21.108 --> 18:23.105
Hey. Come on, let's go. It's cold.

18:23.155 --> 18:26.073
- Alex is going to come home with us.
- OK, where is she?

18:26.123 --> 18:28.079
He's across the street.

18:28.130 --> 18:30.085
Erm... listen, why don't you and I

18:30.135 --> 18:33.094
just spend a little time
together, have a quiet dinner?

18:33.144 --> 18:34.147
He's gay.

18:36.153 --> 18:38.159
Come on over, buddy!

18:52.177 --> 18:53.180
What is it?

18:53.204 --> 18:56.162
Erm, it's a missing persons, sir.

18:56.212 --> 18:57.165
Scott Mobury.

18:57.215 --> 18:59.171
You guys, why don't you go inside, OK?

18:59.221 --> 19:01.177
Mobury? Didn't we find him already?

19:01.227 --> 19:04.186
Scott Mobury, Will's younger
brother. No police record.

19:04.236 --> 19:06.192
He's only 17.

19:06.242 --> 19:08.447
Some kid was found this morning
with his skull caved in.

19:08.471 --> 19:09.201
Let's go.

19:09.251 --> 19:11.206
Kids, go inside.

19:11.257 --> 19:13.262
- I won't be long.
- Alex...?

19:14.266 --> 19:16.271
Alex, what's wrong?

19:27.305 --> 19:28.779
Freya said Will was robbing farms.

19:28.829 --> 19:31.436
She was worried he was using
his brother to help him.

19:32.319 --> 19:34.275
This is it, sir. Dead Man's Wood.

19:34.325 --> 19:36.281
Maybe Scott was here with Will.

19:36.331 --> 19:39.290
- Could Scott have killed his brother?
- His sister says no way.

19:39.340 --> 19:40.292
I believe her.

19:40.343 --> 19:43.301
Scott followed Will
around like a lost puppy.

19:43.351 --> 19:44.666
He worshipped him.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.314
Followed him right into all this shit.

19:47.364 --> 19:49.370
I think we're looking for another body.

19:50.372 --> 19:52.329
We need to talk to Audrey Merrick.

19:52.379 --> 19:54.385
And Ray Gilchrist.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.544
- Hey!
- Jesus...

20:25.594 --> 20:28.552
- You need to leave.
- Worried we're going to find something?

20:28.603 --> 20:31.509
You'll be finding you in a minute.
I'm set to muck spread here.

20:32.612 --> 20:35.409
- Is that someone's mother?
- Someone's sister.

20:35.459 --> 20:36.621
Ma'am, I found this.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.587
It's clean. It's been dropped recently.

20:42.637 --> 20:44.591
The stone's missing.

20:44.641 --> 20:46.115
Is that yours?

20:46.165 --> 20:47.598
Do I look like I wear rings?

20:53.022 --> 20:55.348
See the way she just looked at her?

20:56.671 --> 21:00.149
Well, if the ring isn't Audrey's,
maybe it's the Gilchrists'?

21:00.199 --> 21:02.686
That road leads to their house.

21:51.806 --> 21:53.109
Sorry, we tried knocking.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.768
- It's beautiful music.
- He has a lovely voice.

21:56.818 --> 21:58.824
He gets it from his old man, of course.

21:59.866 --> 22:01.781
The name's Albert.

22:01.831 --> 22:04.788
And this is my Ray of sunshine.

22:04.838 --> 22:06.793
We've already spoken to the police.

22:06.843 --> 22:10.050
I've prayed for the lad who died.
He is in the Lord's arms this morn.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.978
Can you take a look at these for me?

22:15.865 --> 22:17.870
- Two?
- Scott.

22:18.872 --> 22:20.506
He's only a boy. He's 17.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.833
The dead lad's little brother.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.837
17's not a boy.

22:24.888 --> 22:27.845
I saw my first tour of duty at that age.

22:27.895 --> 22:30.050
- Are you a veteran, sir?
- Two Para.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.215
I fought at Goose Green.

22:32.265 --> 22:33.860
The Falklands.

22:33.910 --> 22:35.865
It's a lot like this place.

22:35.915 --> 22:37.549
Bare, muddy terrain.

22:37.599 --> 22:39.874
And thousands of miles from civilisation.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.721
I'll get you some biscuits.

22:42.771 --> 22:44.887
Thank you.

22:44.937 --> 22:47.894
Crack out the special
rations, officer, for the mess.

22:47.944 --> 22:51.102
I know I've had some troubles
in my past, but I've atoned.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.106
The past tends to repeat itself, Ray.

22:53.156 --> 22:54.911
You've got anger management issues.

22:54.961 --> 22:58.971
"The anger of man does not
achieve the righteousness of God."

23:00.976 --> 23:02.981
When I feel that anger...

23:03.983 --> 23:06.940
those words of James
calm me every time.

23:06.990 --> 23:09.838
Every time? They should
prescribe that on the NHS.

23:11.201 --> 23:14.008
What about the anger
of Audrey Merrick, Ray?

23:15.010 --> 23:18.017
I don't see that there's a
Bible verse about that one.

23:19.020 --> 23:21.336
Maybe Matthew 6:19.

23:21.386 --> 23:22.980
"Do not store up for yourself..."

23:23.030 --> 23:26.037
"the treasures of Earth where
thieves break in and steal."

23:27.040 --> 23:29.044
I'm American. In God we trust.

23:31.050 --> 23:33.055
Do you recognise this?

23:36.062 --> 23:38.017
No, sorry.

23:38.067 --> 23:39.069
I wish I could help.

23:39.109 --> 23:41.024
I think you can. I...

23:41.074 --> 23:42.026
We're done here.

23:42.076 --> 23:44.082
Thank you, Mr Gilchrist.

23:50.457 --> 23:54.056
Did you see his face when I
teased him about his versifying?

23:54.107 --> 23:56.061
Ray's temper's gone nowhere.

23:56.111 --> 23:59.118
- Audrey has a temper.
- And yet no history of assault.

24:00.121 --> 24:01.594
She has no record of assault.

24:01.644 --> 24:03.759
Whatever history she has is very deep.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.086
We've got a trace on Scott's phone.

24:06.136 --> 24:07.930
It's on the move.

24:07.980 --> 24:11.148
It's 14 miles from here, near Stickney.

24:17.163 --> 24:20.170
He's stopped up here. 200 yards.

24:34.204 --> 24:36.159
Take a look inside.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.389
All clear.

25:10.293 --> 25:12.298
Hey!

25:15.306 --> 25:17.260
That's our car!

25:21.320 --> 25:25.640
They said they stopped at
Stickney Services for petrol.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.285
Used the power wash to clean the tent.

25:27.335 --> 25:30.132
Left the boot open. Someone
must have chucked the phone in.

25:30.182 --> 25:31.986
Yeah, to get us headed
in the wrong direction.

25:32.010 --> 25:34.302
Make us think Scott was on
his way across the North Sea.

25:34.352 --> 25:37.309
Mrs Merrick does like a little
bit of misdirection, doesn't she?

25:37.359 --> 25:39.044
Or Ray.

25:40.367 --> 25:44.326
- What have you got on the phone, anything?
- The tech boys found this.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.331
Deleted message meant for his sister.

25:46.381 --> 25:48.336
I can't tell when he wrote
it. It never got sent.

25:48.386 --> 25:49.338
And unfinished.

25:49.389 --> 25:52.396
"I wish I had listened when you..."

25:58.771 --> 26:00.365
Kelsey!

26:00.415 --> 26:01.419
Dinner!

26:03.423 --> 26:05.428
I found Mexican take-out!

26:07.433 --> 26:08.435
Kels?

26:09.438 --> 26:11.392
Kelsey!

26:11.442 --> 26:12.446
Kelsey?

26:13.448 --> 26:15.453
Kelsey!

26:18.460 --> 26:20.415
So, you and Scott were close?

26:20.465 --> 26:23.422
Scott stood up for me
when nobody else would.

26:23.472 --> 26:26.430
Thanks for coming. I couldn't
just sit at home knowing that he...

26:26.480 --> 26:28.435
Yeah, it's fine. I get it.

26:28.485 --> 26:31.051
Erm, listen, Alex, usually when
the police do a search like that,

26:31.075 --> 26:32.444
it generally means...

26:32.494 --> 26:34.539
Dead Man's Wood. I get it.

26:39.552 --> 26:42.519
What's that? They're burning something.

26:43.497 --> 26:44.500
Scott?

26:44.524 --> 26:46.478
Scott!

26:46.528 --> 26:47.482
Are you there?

26:47.532 --> 26:49.326
Wait!

26:49.376 --> 26:51.491
- Scott! Scott!
- Alex, come back!

26:51.541 --> 26:52.905
- Scott, where are you?
- Alex!

26:54.548 --> 26:55.551
Shit!

26:56.553 --> 26:57.556
Kelsey!

26:58.558 --> 27:00.874
- Jesus Christ!
- Alex! Where's Alex?

27:01.426 --> 27:02.428
What's going on?

27:03.070 --> 27:04.884
There's no-one there.
Just burning rubbish.

27:04.934 --> 27:07.530
- Scott's not there.
- What are you talking about?

27:07.580 --> 27:11.541
Scott said he was working on
a farm near Dead Man's Wood.

27:11.591 --> 27:13.545
Scott? You mean Scott Mobury?

27:13.595 --> 27:14.598
He's my friend.

27:14.638 --> 27:17.555
He told me he was working near
here with his brother Will.

27:17.605 --> 27:18.607
Where's my phone?

27:20.612 --> 27:22.568
- I want my mum.
- All right.

27:22.618 --> 27:25.094
I'll call your mum. Come
on, I don't have her number.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.627
Yes, you do.

27:33.645 --> 27:34.958
Jesus, Alex.

27:35.008 --> 27:37.654
Why didn't you tell me it was your Scott?

27:39.659 --> 27:41.614
Look, I didn't put two and two together.

27:41.664 --> 27:43.618
I went up to her room and she was gone.

27:43.669 --> 27:46.627
Yeah, taking my son out in
the middle of the night.

27:46.677 --> 27:48.631
- Excuse me?
- Alex is vulnerable.

27:48.681 --> 27:50.636
My daughter is 14 years old, American

27:50.686 --> 27:52.210
and in her first week at a new school.

27:52.234 --> 27:55.882
And lost her mother. You want
to talk to me about vulnerable?

27:56.701 --> 27:57.704
I was worried.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.503
I didn't know you had a son that old.

28:01.553 --> 28:03.798
Yeah, well, we start young
in these parts. Fast learners.

28:03.822 --> 28:06.188
This isn't a good friendship.

28:07.246 --> 28:10.736
- We shouldn't encourage them.
- Yeah, no argument there.

28:15.747 --> 28:17.221
You're grounded.

28:17.271 --> 28:20.710
That is the single least effective
punishment you could give me.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.715
- I'm always grounded, Dad.
- Kelsey...

28:22.765 --> 28:24.720
Maybe you like keeping
your distance from people.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.724
But I don't.

28:26.775 --> 28:29.732
Tonight was not the smartest
move, and I get that.

28:29.782 --> 28:32.289
- It was dangerous.
- Alex needed to find his friend.

28:32.990 --> 28:36.639
That's what people do for
people they care about.

28:53.841 --> 28:56.799
Well, hello, Alex's mom.

28:56.849 --> 28:59.645
What joyous revelation
do you have for me today?

28:59.695 --> 29:01.810
So, that's another four
good cops off the street.

29:01.861 --> 29:04.818
I suppose you get a bonus per redundancy.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.876
Do you think your son knows
what farm Scott worked on?

29:08.878 --> 29:10.682
No. I think I have a pretty good idea.

29:11.885 --> 29:14.842
Can you imagine fighting off
two young guys single-handedly?

29:14.892 --> 29:16.847
She's something else.

29:16.874 --> 29:18.879
I mean, have you seen what
Will Mobury looked like?

29:18.903 --> 29:21.860
- You don't know that Audrey killed anybody.
- That's just the thing.

29:21.910 --> 29:23.865
I do. I see it in her.

29:23.915 --> 29:25.869
- You like her, don't you?
- What?

29:25.919 --> 29:27.714
A bit of advice, don't get attached.

29:27.764 --> 29:30.210
- Did she say that?
- Jesus, they're your words, not Audrey's.

29:30.234 --> 29:32.887
Why do you bother with these
redundancy procedures?

29:32.937 --> 29:35.102
Just grab a shovel and
dispatched the runts one by one!

29:35.126 --> 29:36.896
You and her firing off rounds

29:36.947 --> 29:39.102
at anyone who dares come
near your little island.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.107
Of course you know what she's capable of.

29:41.157 --> 29:42.962
You are her.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.016
That explains the bangs.

30:07.021 --> 30:09.978
Whose clothes are you burning, Audrey?

30:25.586 --> 30:27.020
What are you two up to?

30:27.070 --> 30:29.867
Back issues of The Stump.

30:29.917 --> 30:32.393
"Ray Gilchrist cautioned by police"

30:32.443 --> 30:34.127
"for fighting one of
his own farm workers."

30:34.151 --> 30:36.041
Blah, blah, blah.

30:36.091 --> 30:38.047
Lydia's lad said young
Scott worked on the farm.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.052
Yeah, he didn't say which
farm, though, did he?

30:40.102 --> 30:42.107
- He didn't need to.
- Click that photo.

30:43.149 --> 30:45.425
No, that's the wrong
Gilchrist. That's Albert.

30:45.475 --> 30:47.068
Ray's dad.

30:47.119 --> 30:50.077
- He did all right, didn't he?
- Shut your mouth!

30:50.127 --> 30:51.129
What?

30:54.136 --> 30:56.091
That's the ring from the field.

30:56.141 --> 30:58.547
It had a stone in it then.
But that's the same ring.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.169
Where's His Lordship?

31:17.193 --> 31:19.147
I don't know. I don't care.

31:19.197 --> 31:21.834
Guess which farm the Moburys worked for.

31:21.884 --> 31:24.210
Ray Gilchrist hires ex-offenders.

31:25.213 --> 31:27.217
Get in there, you beauty!

31:29.222 --> 31:31.177
Jesus, well, bad blood
all over, isn't it, lads?

31:44.259 --> 31:45.732
Jesus! Can I help you?

31:45.782 --> 31:48.109
I'm Chief Constable Bill Hixon.

31:49.272 --> 31:52.068
Anthony Stone. I run the five parishes.

31:52.118 --> 31:55.085
- I'm just a little bit jumpy today.
- That's all right, I don't blame you.

31:55.109 --> 31:57.014
I saw who just came out of your church.

31:57.491 --> 32:00.820
I see the Merricks and the
Gilchrists are all over this place.

32:02.303 --> 32:05.260
- What did Miss Merrick have to say for herself?
- The late Reverend Stone

32:05.310 --> 32:07.395
said this used to be mutual
ground for both families.

32:07.419 --> 32:08.628
But not so much any more.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.273
Apart from Ray Gilchrist, that is.

32:10.323 --> 32:12.328
That's one of Ray's, actually.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.285
My old parish used to buy me ciggies.

32:15.335 --> 32:17.290
This place would be dust without Ray.

32:17.340 --> 32:19.295
1982. The year of the feud.

32:19.345 --> 32:21.299
He prepares the service sheets.

32:21.349 --> 32:23.305
He tends to the churchyard.

32:23.355 --> 32:24.829
He even fixed a pew that...

32:24.879 --> 32:29.319
In September 4th, there's a double
booking for Gilchrist and Merrick.

32:29.369 --> 32:31.324
I thought they hated each other.

32:31.374 --> 32:33.330
But this looks like a wedding.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.224
It's private business.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.394
What did Audrey want?

32:42.401 --> 32:44.406
She came to talk about absolution.

32:45.409 --> 32:46.412
I'll bet she did.

32:47.414 --> 32:49.369
She wanted to know if
God still loved those

32:49.419 --> 32:50.822
with murder in their hearts.

33:07.897 --> 33:10.352
Burning trash at night. Is that legal?

33:10.402 --> 33:12.036
Is trespassing?

33:13.770 --> 33:16.367
I know about you and Ray.

33:16.417 --> 33:18.411
He gave you his mother's ring, didn't he?

33:18.461 --> 33:20.376
We found it in the field.

33:22.431 --> 33:25.388
I know you were gonna get married,
I've seen the church records.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.393
September 4th, 1982.

33:27.443 --> 33:29.397
Gilchrist... Merrick.

33:29.447 --> 33:31.402
What did he do, stand you up?

33:31.452 --> 33:33.457
Stand me up?

33:34.459 --> 33:36.504
- Are you joking?
- That's where the ring came from.

33:36.528 --> 33:38.940
The one he gave you. Ray's mother's ring.

33:38.990 --> 33:41.426
The Moburys robbed you that
night. You walked in on it.

33:41.476 --> 33:43.431
You hit Will with a shovel.

33:43.481 --> 33:45.485
Did you do the same thing to Scott?

33:48.493 --> 33:50.447
Where did you bury him?

33:50.497 --> 33:52.001
His sister would like to know.

33:58.516 --> 34:00.521
I've got a field to
plough. You need to go.

34:03.528 --> 34:06.485
Look, you lied to us,
Ray. You hire criminals.

34:06.535 --> 34:08.489
I hire people who need a second chance!

34:08.540 --> 34:10.495
It's more than her over
the field would do.

34:10.545 --> 34:12.018
What's wrong with basic tools?

34:13.552 --> 34:16.348
Digging your hands in the
turf, like God intended.

34:16.399 --> 34:18.514
- Biscuits!
- Will and Scott Mobury,

34:18.563 --> 34:21.521
they didn't appreciate their
second chance, did they?

34:21.571 --> 34:23.525
Robbed their Good Samaritan blind, right?

34:23.576 --> 34:25.530
You caught them, didn't you, Ray?

34:25.580 --> 34:28.536
Right, I mean, still, that kind
of betrayal must have stung.

34:28.587 --> 34:30.221
There's nowt to rob here!

34:30.271 --> 34:31.543
Unlike her place.

34:31.594 --> 34:34.551
Come on, Ray, now it's time
to start talking to me.

34:34.601 --> 34:36.766
Before I come back with
forensics and a search warrant.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.563
Dad!

34:39.612 --> 34:40.565
Dad, don't!

34:40.616 --> 34:42.570
Dad, don't, you'll cut yourself.

34:42.621 --> 34:44.254
Just sit down. Just sit down, OK?

34:44.304 --> 34:45.618
Do you know what? Just get out.

34:45.668 --> 34:48.585
You, go and get your warrant.
Just get your warrant.

34:48.635 --> 34:51.592
Cos you're not coming back
through these doors without one.

34:51.641 --> 34:53.326
- All right, just let me...
- Get out!

34:54.649 --> 34:55.650
Get out!

34:58.634 --> 34:59.637
Dad, Dad, Dad, don't.

34:59.661 --> 35:01.505
No, it's OK, don't worry.

35:05.876 --> 35:07.630
The ring.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.634
It's Audrey's.

35:09.685 --> 35:11.639
That puts Mobury on her property.

35:11.689 --> 35:13.644
I guess Scott's body's
somewhere here, too.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.649
We'll get a search warrant, we'll...

35:15.699 --> 35:16.651
Argh...!

35:16.701 --> 35:18.656
- Jesus!
- Is that what burnt his fingers?

35:18.706 --> 35:20.661
I doubt it. Come on...

35:20.711 --> 35:22.665
We're going to follow
their route that night.

35:22.715 --> 35:24.670
Where did they go? How did they get in?

35:24.720 --> 35:26.354
They saw Audrey heading out.

35:26.404 --> 35:27.767
We need to do this fast.

35:30.935 --> 35:33.691
Are those cables wired to the mains?

35:33.741 --> 35:35.696
That'd give you a shock.

35:35.746 --> 35:39.706
Did Freya say Will called saying
something about seeing sparks?

35:39.756 --> 35:42.392
I don't know why more thieves
don't invest in these.

35:42.442 --> 35:43.765
But it'll do.

35:59.803 --> 36:00.805
Jesus...

36:05.817 --> 36:07.822
This hatch was wired up.

36:25.905 --> 36:27.870
Plenty to steal here.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.160
Shit!

37:13.979 --> 37:14.981
Jesus!

37:16.505 --> 37:17.938
Jesus Christ!

37:17.988 --> 37:20.143
Scott! What has she done to you?

37:20.193 --> 37:21.947
Scott!

37:21.998 --> 37:22.950
Can you hear me?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.955
- Can you hear me?
- Don't touch him!

37:25.005 --> 37:25.957
Stop!

37:26.007 --> 37:27.009
You've done enough.

37:31.019 --> 37:32.322
I thought you'd killed him.

37:33.224 --> 37:34.978
I tried to.

37:35.028 --> 37:36.983
I thought I'd killed both of them.

37:37.033 --> 37:41.043
I wired up those bars.
I wanted to kill them.

37:42.045 --> 37:44.571
- I was sick of being robbed.
- What about his brother?

37:47.057 --> 37:49.011
She didn't touch him.

37:49.062 --> 37:50.535
Will left me.

37:50.585 --> 37:52.069
I fell, but...

37:53.071 --> 37:55.026
He just grabbed the stuff and ran.

37:55.076 --> 37:58.033
We climbed up to the
window, we both got shocked.

37:58.083 --> 38:00.038
I fell.

38:00.088 --> 38:02.042
He just went on in and took what he could.

38:02.092 --> 38:04.047
He left me for dead.

38:04.097 --> 38:06.052
It's all right, Scott.

38:06.102 --> 38:08.107
It's all right now.

38:09.109 --> 38:12.066
Hey, it's all right, my boy.

38:12.116 --> 38:13.640
It's all right.

38:14.963 --> 38:16.246
The last I saw of the other lad,

38:16.270 --> 38:19.277
he was running back towards
the Gilchrist place.

38:33.166 --> 38:36.123
You can look, but you can't touch, Muriel.

38:36.173 --> 38:37.877
They won't grant a search warrant.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.814
Look at him.

38:40.864 --> 38:43.139
He's working up a right head of steam.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.696
Look, sooner or later, he'll
give me probable cause.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.154
It's the boss.

38:49.204 --> 38:50.998
He's waiting for me over there.

38:51.048 --> 38:52.251
What, are you going over there

38:52.275 --> 38:54.847
when there's a murderer to be caught here?

38:54.897 --> 38:57.173
Didn't you hear me, Muriel? He's my boss.

38:57.223 --> 38:59.929
I'm not going to give him
probable cause to fire by arse.

39:03.237 --> 39:06.084
Yeah, yeah, I got your message,
sir. I'm on my way back.

39:13.261 --> 39:15.215
No ambulance.

39:15.265 --> 39:17.220
They'll send him to young offenders.

39:17.270 --> 39:19.225
And that's why I couldn't tell you.

39:19.275 --> 39:21.280
You didn't kill Will, but you think...

39:22.282 --> 39:23.284
Ray did.

39:24.648 --> 39:26.240
You were going to marry him.

39:26.291 --> 39:27.975
More fool me.

39:29.298 --> 39:30.821
My dad told me.

39:32.305 --> 39:35.512
That lot just wanted to put all our
land into the Gilchrists' name.

39:36.996 --> 39:38.319
Tax efficient, they said.

39:40.324 --> 39:42.328
Ray never wanted me.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.288
You loved him.

39:46.338 --> 39:48.343
He was beautiful once.

39:50.347 --> 39:54.718
I watched him the whole
way crossing the land.

39:56.362 --> 39:57.885
And he had flowers in his hand.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.321
And he asked to go walking...

40:00.371 --> 40:02.326
with me.

40:02.376 --> 40:04.381
And we were going to be married.

40:05.383 --> 40:07.388
Until his daddy came home.

40:08.591 --> 40:10.345
The big injured war hero.

40:10.395 --> 40:12.550
But I never saw no injury.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.407
Whatever it was, it was in his head.

40:16.409 --> 40:18.364
I saw Ray, though.

40:18.414 --> 40:21.371
And whatever Albert said, he jumped.

40:24.468 --> 40:26.433
So much for love.

40:44.475 --> 40:47.483
What the hell have you got in there?

40:53.497 --> 40:55.451
It's OK, Drakes.

40:55.502 --> 40:57.456
I've found Scott Mobury.

40:57.506 --> 40:58.629
You can call off the search.

40:58.653 --> 41:01.620
He's...? What happened to him?

41:02.518 --> 41:04.473
He's all right. He's going to be OK.

41:04.523 --> 41:06.157
Unlike his brother.

41:06.207 --> 41:07.570
So, did Ray do it, sir?

41:08.532 --> 41:10.166
The sparks.

41:10.216 --> 41:11.539
The fireworks.

41:12.542 --> 41:14.496
That pylon blew.

41:14.547 --> 41:16.501
Where's Yeardsley?

41:16.551 --> 41:18.235
I know who killed Will Mobury.

41:22.566 --> 41:24.570
Yes!

41:35.596 --> 41:38.603
That's evidence, Ray. Put it down!

41:39.606 --> 41:41.611
Put it down!

41:44.618 --> 41:45.781
Please, you don't understand.

41:45.821 --> 41:49.469
Ray Gilchrist, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murdering Will...

41:50.311 --> 41:51.584
No! No, Dad!

41:51.634 --> 41:53.589
Argh!

41:53.639 --> 41:54.591
Dad!

41:54.641 --> 41:55.955
No! No!

41:56.005 --> 41:58.601
- Sargent Gilchrist!
- It's all right, sir, I've got this.

41:58.651 --> 42:01.608
You were at Goose Green, weren't you?

42:01.658 --> 42:03.613
- 14 hours under bombardment.
- All for fuck all.

42:03.663 --> 42:06.670
You saw the lights, the
explosions over there.

42:07.672 --> 42:10.629
The lights in the sky coming
from the Merricks' farm.

42:10.679 --> 42:13.636
One of them Argies coming right for me.

42:13.686 --> 42:14.639
For my farm.

42:14.689 --> 42:16.694
You weren't going to let that happen.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.701
Stand down, Sargent!

42:20.703 --> 42:22.658
There's no Argentinian fighters here.

42:22.708 --> 42:25.665
The explosions were the pylons blowing.

42:25.715 --> 42:28.722
Those two aren't the
enemy. Stand down, soldier.

42:30.246 --> 42:32.732
You're just like all the other officers.

42:34.736 --> 42:36.210
You're fucking...

42:36.260 --> 42:37.894
No! No, Dad!

42:37.944 --> 42:40.700
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad! No, no, no!

42:40.750 --> 42:42.224
It's over.

42:42.274 --> 42:43.707
No, no...

42:43.758 --> 42:45.071
It's all over.

42:45.121 --> 42:46.765
No...

42:47.767 --> 42:48.769
No.

42:48.810 --> 42:50.724
No, Dad.

42:50.774 --> 42:52.779
Yeardsley, are you OK?

43:13.829 --> 43:15.673
Shut up!

43:17.197 --> 43:18.790
It'll be all right, Dad.

43:18.841 --> 43:20.795
It'll be all right.

43:20.845 --> 43:21.848
Come on.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.855
- Watch your head.
- Look after him, won't you?

43:25.857 --> 43:27.812
We'll call you from the hospital.

43:27.862 --> 43:30.388
You can come down after and
see him then, all right?

43:48.912 --> 43:49.954
I didn't know.

43:52.761 --> 43:54.876
After you showed me the
pictures of those boys,

43:54.926 --> 43:57.933
he said one of them looked
like a soldier he'd...

44:00.138 --> 44:02.945
he'd killed in the Falklands. So...

44:04.950 --> 44:06.944
And then, when I found
the shovel, then I knew.

44:06.994 --> 44:08.959
I knew.

44:09.962 --> 44:11.966
Ray...

45:03.087 --> 45:04.090
Hey. Erm...

45:05.092 --> 45:07.407
I thought we left it in
kind of a weird place.

45:07.457 --> 45:09.051
Not at all.

45:09.101 --> 45:12.419
You were looking out for
your daughter. It's your job.

45:12.469 --> 45:14.113
She's all I've got.

45:16.118 --> 45:18.123
But she doesn't have to be.

45:22.653 --> 45:24.137
Andrew is...

45:25.821 --> 45:27.144
my ex-husband.

45:29.189 --> 45:32.156
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.

45:33.158 --> 45:35.113
Goodnight.

45:35.163 --> 45:36.165
Wait, Bill...

45:41.017 --> 45:43.132
We're not going in? Your
friends seemed kind of...

45:43.182 --> 45:44.184
She wasn't hungry.

45:45.305 --> 45:51.360
