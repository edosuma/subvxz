you know,

08:11.891 --> 08:13.727
finding that everlasting love.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.529
Hello.
- Hi.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.732
- How are y'all doing?

08:18.798 --> 08:20.066
- Oh, my gosh.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.434
Clayton, this is Lauren.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.769
This is my best friend.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.405
- I'm gonna hug you.
- Yeah, I'm a hugger too.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.539
- Your ears
must have been burning.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.042
We were just talking about you.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.977
<i>- You can tell</i>
<i>the second that Susie</i>

08:31.044 --> 08:33.546

<i>like, her father,</i>

08:33.613 --> 08:36.049
<i>like, they have this</i>
<i>incredibly strong bond.</i>

08:36.116 --> 08:39.352
<i>So I really do want</i>
<i>his approval.</i>

08:39.419 --> 08:40.653
Like it means so much to me,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.689

how important he is to her.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.591
- You brought me flowers too.
- I did.

08:44.657 --> 08:46.259

08:46.326 --> 08:49.195

- Always the jokester, Tom!

<i>- This is a really big step</i>
<i>for Clayton and I.</i>

08:52.232 --> 08:54.567
<i>And it's a really big deal</i>
<i>to my parents.</i>

08:54.634 --> 08:56.369
<i>I'm not, like, worried</i>
<i>about my parents</i>

08:56.436 --> 08:57.904
<i>not embracing Clayton,</i>

08:57.971 --> 09:01.074

important people in the world

09:01.141 --> 09:04.711
to me and like, their opinions,
like, definitely matter.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.747

- Who, me or her?

09:07.814 --> 09:09.883
- Both of you.
- I need to hear every detail.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.851
- Where did you go,
what did you do?

09:11.918 --> 09:14.621
- We have went through such
an incredible journey together.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.723
- I can't even imagine.
- Tell us about it.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.158

09:18.224 --> 09:19.492
A little buzzer.
- Oh, yeah.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.061

You did that?

09:21.127 --> 09:22.429

the first one-on-one date.

I feel like we've been dating

- Oh, wow.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.774

- That's good.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.543

so natural, yeah.

that you guys are here.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.948

Clayton, and I'm excited.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.851
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.855

- Let's do it.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.324
<i>I'm excited to talk</i>

09:51.391 --> 09:54.094

<i>I've missed my family</i>
<i>so much this whole time,</i>

09:56.496 --> 09:58.031

09:58.098 --> 09:59.566
Like, I feel happy.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.035
Are you--I wanted
to ask you like,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.838
is everything going well with
you since I've been gone?

10:04.904 --> 10:06.406
- Yeah, yeah, I--
- Like, your health

10:06.473 --> 10:08.007
and everything?
- I have an MRI tomorrow,

10:08.074 --> 10:10.009
but I'm expecting good results.
- Okay.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.744
- And I'm getting
stronger every day.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.747
- I shared with him like,
when you got sick, like,

10:14.814 --> 10:16.850
one of the things I thought
about that, like,

10:16.916 --> 10:18.485
broke my heart, and I'm like,
I don't even like to

10:18.551 --> 10:20.920
talk about it was, like, the
thought of you not being there

10:20.987 --> 10:23.223
on, like,
the day that I get married.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.625
- Hey, I'm gonna be here
for that--I'm gonna be here.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.926
- I told him today,
I was like,

10:26.993 --> 10:28.862
my dad is, like,
the golden standard of, like,

10:28.928 --> 10:32.632
what I expect in a person
and, like, in a partner.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.501
- Thank you.
- In a man and like...

10:34.567 --> 10:36.703
Yeah, like, you've just really
set the standard really high.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.706
And I think that's why
I've been so tough on people

10:39.772 --> 10:42.308
in the past in relationships
and stuff, like...

10:42.375 --> 10:44.010
- Because of me?
- Kind of a savage.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.346
'Cause you're just
such a good person.

10:46.412 --> 10:47.780
Like,
you're just such a good...

10:47.847 --> 10:49.249
- Thank you.
- Man, and like,

10:49.315 --> 10:51.518
I think that's
what's scary in this is that I,

10:51.584 --> 10:53.820
like, I do believe everything
that he's shown me and stuff.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.991
But like, if he's not, like,
I know I won't stand for it.

10:59.025 --> 11:02.562
I do think that Clayton
and I have something special.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.998
<i>It doesn't feel like,</i>
<i>any other kind of relationship</i>

11:05.064 --> 11:06.633
<i>that I've had before this.</i>

11:06.699 --> 11:11.538
So I just hope that my dad,
like, really likes Clayton.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.806
- I just
want you to know, like,

11:13.873 --> 11:16.910
if you choose Susie,
what you're getting.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.778
And I don't know if she--
I know she's talked to you

11:18.845 --> 11:21.181
about it, but I got really sick
last year.

11:21.247 --> 11:25.718
And on one of the worst nights,
she slept next to my bed

11:25.785 --> 11:27.520
and would not leave
my side all night.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.956
And that's the type
of person you're getting.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.927
She's--she's special.
You know that, right? I mean...

11:33.993 --> 11:35.128
- I figured that out
so early on.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.429
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.097
- I'm surprised someone
hasn't nabbed her yet.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.033
- Well, that's what--
- You've got her on the line.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.501
All you gotta do
is reel her in.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.937
- I asked her that, I said
the guys that you've apparently

11:44.003 --> 11:47.140
talked to before this, like,
are dumb as a box of rocks.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.609
'Cause I was like, I don't
understand how you're here.

11:49.676 --> 11:50.910
But I'm not gonna question it.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.612
I said, because like,
if I even tried to find

11:52.679 --> 11:53.913
a yellow flag,
I couldn't find one.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.481
- My wife and I look up to her

11:55.548 --> 11:57.650
because she sets examples
for us all the time.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.852
Just how nice she is.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.588
What a good person she is.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.356
I mean, she's amazing.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.926
And the thing I see
is that when you guys

12:06.993 --> 12:11.030
walked in the door,
there was definitely

12:11.097 --> 12:14.234
something there with you guys.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.536
And I felt really
comfortable just having

12:16.603 --> 12:18.371
you come into my house,
you know?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.273
I mean, you seem like
a really good guy.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.076
And I know this too,
I know Susie would know

12:23.142 --> 12:24.677
if you were a bad guy or not.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.813
You know,
so I defer to her judgment.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.414
- Thank you so much.
- And I'll tell you this.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.250
if Susie loves you,
we'll love you.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.051
<i>- You know,</i>
<i>it's a major thing to get</i>

12:32.118 --> 12:35.555

12:35.622 --> 12:38.725
<i>knowing how much</i>
<i>he means to her.</i>

12:38.791 --> 12:41.160
<i>And it's a great step</i>
<i>in the right direction</i>

12:41.227 --> 12:43.229

nothing holding us back.

12:43.296 --> 12:48.067
I'm so blown away by who
Susie is and her character.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.170
- Yeah, she is incredible.
- It absolutely blew me away.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.506
- And if you guys
do end up together,

12:53.573 --> 12:54.907
you know, she will be loyal.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.676
- Yeah.
- As long as you're loyal.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.144
If you're not loyal,
then she's outta there.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.213
- And rightfully so.
- Yeah.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.182
Um, you know, do you think
you love Susie?

13:04.817 --> 13:08.121
- So I will say
that I have very,

13:08.187 --> 13:09.889
very strong feelings for Susie.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.127
And to fall in love to me is...

13:14.193 --> 13:15.662
it's very sacred and like,
and I--

13:15.728 --> 13:17.330
and I know that I will--
I will get there.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.533
There's a part of me that
is trying to make sense of it

13:20.600 --> 13:22.769
in my head with--
just to be honest with you,

13:22.835 --> 13:26.606
with other women around,
I'm like, I don't necessarily--

13:26.673 --> 13:28.041
like, I kind of guard myself
'cause I'm afraid to like--

13:28.107 --> 13:29.575
I'm like, I don't want to fall
in love with, like,

13:29.642 --> 13:31.244
four people--
that doesn't make sense.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.013
And so--but when I look
at Susie and I'm like,

13:34.080 --> 13:35.682
I don't--there's--
there's no question in my mind

13:35.748 --> 13:37.450
that, like, I will get there.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.919
Speaking with Susie's mom,
I can understand her concern.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.990

13:44.057 --> 13:46.159
<i>But I also have these feelings</i>
<i>for these other women as well.</i>

13:46.225 --> 13:47.827
And it's like,
my head is spinning.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.462
It's like,
can I fall in love with

13:49.529 --> 13:52.365
four women at one time?
And I just don't know.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.234

that there's definitely

13:55.301 --> 13:56.969
a connection
between the two of you.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.272
- I feel really good
about where I'm at.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.375
- Do you think
you want to marry him?

14:02.442 --> 14:05.044
- I think I could
marry this man.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.180
But it is still very scary.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.515
Because I feel like
Clayton is somebody

14:09.582 --> 14:11.184
that could, like,
break my heart.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.186
- I think
that you're on the right track

14:13.252 --> 14:14.787
to be cautious.
- Mm-hmm.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.491
- You know,
I came right out and asked him,

14:18.558 --> 14:21.494
you know,
"Are you in love with Susie?"

14:21.561 --> 14:23.396
He didn't say that he's
in love with you, he said,

14:23.463 --> 14:26.099
but he can see that
he could get there with you.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.501
And that he would
never want to hurt you.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.703
So proceed with caution.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.905
- Yeah.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.308
<i>I think my mom</i>
<i>being concerned is, like,</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:37.610
<i>something I will, like,</i>
<i>keep in the back of my head.</i>

Proceed with caution,

<i>But I think she sees</i>
<i>that he's a good man.</i>

16:47.840 --> 16:49.342

I don't know what you have

16:50.643 --> 16:52.111
in the wilderness here.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.747
- You have to cut down trees
and fight bears to meet them.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.349
- Oh, okay.
I'm here for it, you ready?

16:56.415 --> 16:58.451

you're supposed to do

17:25.878 --> 17:27.146

17:27.213 --> 17:28.948

you're supposed to,

17:29.015 --> 17:30.917
like, scream at it and get big.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.852
- Yeah. What if
you see a grizzly bear?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.020
- You play dead.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.388

how'd you know that?

17:35.454 --> 17:36.756

Okay, okay, okay--

24:20.859 --> 24:22.695

has she always been kind of--

24:29.802 --> 24:31.704

24:31.770 --> 24:33.973
is she keeps me on my toes.

24:34.039 --> 24:35.841
But, like, that's what I love
is, like, a sense of humor

24:35.908 --> 24:37.209
is so important to me.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.311
And, like, there was a whole
side of, like, being able

24:39.378 --> 24:41.647
to talk about
the emotional side of things.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.615

she was a little more reserved,

24:43.682 --> 24:45.884

somebody different.

I've never had to do this

43:53.064 --> 43:55.299
in such a short time, so...

43:55.366 --> 43:56.934
I've gotta base a lot
of my feelings off of

43:57.001 --> 43:58.636
how she's acting.
- Yeah.

43:58.703 --> 44:00.471
- And I'm not listening
to her as much as I'm

44:00.538 --> 44:02.173
watching her body language.
- Yeah.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.275
- It takes her a lot to be
vulnerable with her family

44:04.342 --> 44:07.545
that she's grown up with,
and she just met you.

44:07.612 --> 44:10.014
I was shocked when she said,
like, for example,

44:10.081 --> 44:11.983
my grandma--
that happened two years ago.

44:12.049 --> 44:14.385
Our cousin--
that happened like, two,

44:14.452 --> 44:16.787
maybe three months ago,
somewhere in there.

44:16.854 --> 44:20.558
The fact that she told you
about that is huge,

44:20.625 --> 44:22.760
because that's still an open
wound for her, for sure.

44:22.827 --> 44:25.363

that she sees something

44:25.429 --> 44:26.697

- Yeah.

be really careful and fra--

44:29.567 --> 44:31.002
it's--it's really fragile.

44:31.068 --> 44:32.904
- As we've been together, like,
she's continued to open up,

44:32.970 --> 44:35.106
and it's, like,
for me that's attractive

44:35.173 --> 44:36.874
because it's, like, wow,
like, this is someone

44:36.941 --> 44:39.210
who's trusting me
and continues to open up,

44:39.277 --> 44:41.179
and I don't even have to ask
for it at this point, like.

44:41.245 --> 44:43.247
- It feels crazy
that I'm asking you this

44:43.314 --> 44:46.250
because I just met you,
but again,

44:46.317 --> 44:48.152
it's possible that
the next time I see her

44:48.219 --> 44:50.488
outside of today,
she might be engaged.

44:50.555 --> 44:53.824
- Absolutely.
- So do you love her?

44:54.926 --> 44:56.727
- I...

44:56.794 --> 44:59.830
Um, to tell you
the truth, like,

44:59.897 --> 45:02.500
I haven't told anybody
that I'm in love with them.

I was falling in love with him.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.783

45:18.849 --> 45:21.219
And when I told him that,
by the way,

45:21.285 --> 45:24.922
he was like,
face lit up like a little kid.

45:24.989 --> 45:26.757

45:26.824 --> 45:29.060
hearing that
you can get there so fast.

45:29.126 --> 45:32.797
- Yeah, I think--I think from
the jump, we've had a very good

connection, like the spark, you
know, that people talk about,

45:36.500 --> 45:40.905

telling him anything.

45:40.972 --> 45:44.909

45:44.976 --> 45:49.180

most recent thing is Shanaya

45:49.247 --> 45:52.817
and how, you know, I didn't
have, like, a sister.

45:52.883 --> 45:56.454
And she was really that
for me growing up, and I told

45:56.520 --> 46:00.992
him about the fireflies, and...

46:02.627 --> 46:06.530
He got me this jar.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.367

think of her.

Like as we travel,
you can have fireflies.

46:17.541 --> 46:20.144

- It was really reassuring.

46:20.211 --> 46:21.679

46:21.746 --> 46:23.514

than I normally would.

1:02:03.620 --> 1:02:05.155
<i>- I'm an old-fashioned guy.</i>

1:02:05.222 --> 1:02:07.357
<i>People always have</i>
<i>to prove their selves to me</i>

1:02:07.424 --> 1:02:08.959
<i>that they're good people.</i>

1:02:09.025 --> 1:02:10.927
As a father, you're protective.

1:02:10.994 --> 1:02:14.798
And no matter how old you get,

1:02:14.864 --> 1:02:18.101
you would do anything
to protect a daughter.

1:02:18.168 --> 1:02:21.638
<i>Even with her last boyfriend,</i>
<i>when they were--</i>

1:02:21.705 --> 1:02:23.740
had an argument, and I said,

1:02:23.807 --> 1:02:25.408
"Do you want me
to beat him up?"

1:02:26.876 --> 1:02:30.413
<i>So I'm looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing what he's all about.</i>

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:33.850
- Thank you for taking the time
to sit down and talk with me,

1:02:33.917 --> 1:02:37.854
and, you know, I'm sure you
might have a lot of questions

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:40.757
and--and I wanna be able to
answer any and all them and--

1:02:40.824 --> 1:02:42.492
- I do have a few.

1:02:48.365 --> 1:02:50.867
- So I wanna know first
of all, you're happy?

1:02:50.934 --> 1:02:52.335
- I am very happy.

1:02:52.402 --> 1:02:53.903
- Yeah,
I can see it in your face.

1:02:53.970 --> 1:02:56.539
I haven't seen this
in you Rachel, seriously!

1:02:56.606 --> 1:02:58.808
This is the first time
I've seen you like this!

1:02:58.875 --> 1:03:02.145
- I really, really think
I could see him as my husband.

1:03:02.212 --> 1:03:03.313
I really do.

1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:04.381
- That makes me happy.

1:03:04.447 --> 1:03:05.815
- I know.

1:03:05.882 --> 1:03:08.518
- I did talk to him about Dad.
- [laughs]

1:03:08.585 --> 1:03:11.254
- I'm not kidding, I'm nervous.
- What did you say?

1:03:11.321 --> 1:03:13.023
- I just said
he doesn't like anyone.

1:03:13.089 --> 1:03:15.025
- [laughs]
- Is it wrong?

1:03:15.091 --> 1:03:16.660
- Yeah, no, that's pretty true.

1:03:16.726 --> 1:03:18.728
<i>- My dad</i>
<i>is outside with Clayton,</i>

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:20.630
and I am terrified.

1:03:20.697 --> 1:03:23.133
I want the conversation
to go well.

1:03:23.199 --> 1:03:26.703
And I'm just hoping
my dad can be civil with him.

1:03:26.770 --> 1:03:29.339
- Nothing to me
is off limits, like,

1:03:29.406 --> 1:03:31.341
I want you to feel as
comfortable as possible.

1:03:31.408 --> 1:03:34.210
And--and again, like,
I also have questions as well,

1:03:34.277 --> 1:03:35.812
and I think it's just
great to be able to open that

1:03:35.879 --> 1:03:38.915
dialogue up and be transparent,
and--and I would

1:03:38.982 --> 1:03:40.850
love to, yeah,
to be in that conversation.

1:03:40.917 --> 1:03:43.486
So whatever it is...

1:03:43.553 --> 1:03:46.022
- Well, you know,
one of the questions

1:03:46.089 --> 1:03:50.827
I have for you is what do you
know about Rachel besides...

1:03:50.894 --> 1:03:52.962
- The exotic locations.
- The exotic locations.

1:03:53.029 --> 1:03:54.931
- All the--all the pizzazz.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:56.766
- Do you know her dreams?

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:59.669
- Well, we have talked about
her past relationships

1:03:59.736 --> 1:04:02.005
and how she has these
aspirations, obviously,

1:04:02.072 --> 1:04:04.441
she's in pilot school,
she wants to be a pilot.

1:04:04.507 --> 1:04:06.776
I love that she's independent,
I love that--like

1:04:06.843 --> 1:04:08.745
she's passionate about
being a pilot, I mean--

1:04:08.812 --> 1:04:09.779
- Right.
- She loves it.

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:11.881
- Has been since eighth grade.

1:04:11.948 --> 1:04:14.718
So if she wants to work
in Europe for a year,

1:04:14.784 --> 1:04:17.620
what would that do to you guys
and your relationship?

1:04:17.687 --> 1:04:19.456
- I'm not gonna waste
this opportunity.

1:04:19.522 --> 1:04:20.757
Like, I'll do
whatever it takes.

1:04:20.824 --> 1:04:22.025
Like, I'll move.

1:04:22.092 --> 1:04:23.860
I'll go wherever
it makes sense to go.

1:04:23.927 --> 1:04:26.096
And if that means going
to Europe, because,

1:04:26.162 --> 1:04:27.497
you know,
Rachel wants to go to Europe

1:04:27.564 --> 1:04:29.232
and that's--for her work,
then like, then why not?

1:04:29.299 --> 1:04:31.267
- The number one thing
that a parent

1:04:31.334 --> 1:04:33.937
doesn't wanna see
is their daughter get hurt.

1:04:34.003 --> 1:04:35.438
- Yeah.

1:04:35.505 --> 1:04:37.340
- And, you know,
you're in this and you still

1:04:37.407 --> 1:04:40.377
have three other girls.
- Yeah.

1:04:40.443 --> 1:04:44.147
- And I watch you
interact and, you know,

1:04:44.214 --> 1:04:48.084
it almost--to me looks, like,
there is nobody else.

1:04:48.151 --> 1:04:52.655
But that's the part
that's concerning me right now.

1:04:52.722 --> 1:04:54.891
- Absolutely. The thing about
it is I will hurt somebody.

1:04:54.958 --> 1:04:58.027
- You're gonna hurt three other
people, or two other people.

1:04:58.094 --> 1:04:59.896
- I'm going to,
and it makes me sick,

1:04:59.963 --> 1:05:03.199
but it's--it's--again, I--
people say "I don't envy you,"

1:05:03.266 --> 1:05:05.135
and I'm like, yeah,
I don't envy myself either.

1:05:05.201 --> 1:05:07.003
Because, again, like,
dating, you know, from start,

1:05:07.070 --> 1:05:09.205
30 women is not fun,
actually, it's really not.

1:05:09.272 --> 1:05:11.107
It's--but it's like you--
you end up meeting

1:05:11.174 --> 1:05:13.176
someone like Rachel, where
you're like, it's worth it.

1:05:13.243 --> 1:05:16.846
- And if Rachel isn't the one,
what are you gonna do

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:19.416
to not hurt her?

1:05:19.482 --> 1:05:22.585
- I have no intention
of--of hurting Rachel.

1:05:22.652 --> 1:05:24.687
I don't have a crystal ball
as far as what it looks, like,

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:25.989
at the end of this journey.

1:05:26.055 --> 1:05:28.224
But I know that I see
a future with her.

1:05:28.291 --> 1:05:30.827
I've had thoughts,
I've dreamt about, like,

1:05:30.894 --> 1:05:32.262
getting down on a knee,
proposing to her,

1:05:32.328 --> 1:05:35.198
like, what life would
look like outside of this.

1:05:35.265 --> 1:05:36.433
If I didn't
see a future with her,

1:05:36.499 --> 1:05:38.001
I would not
be sitting here before you,

1:05:38.067 --> 1:05:41.738
and all I can do
is continue to just keep taking

1:05:41.805 --> 1:05:43.206
these steps, this being one
of them, meeting her family.

1:05:43.273 --> 1:05:44.908
- Right.

1:05:44.974 --> 1:05:48.711
- My hope coming here was
to hopefully walk away saying,

1:05:48.778 --> 1:05:51.014
"Hey, I could see myself
being a part of the family."

1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:52.482
- Okay.

1:05:52.549 --> 1:05:56.586
Well, I really can't
give my blessing...

1:05:56.653 --> 1:05:59.355
because I haven't
talked to my daughter.

1:05:59.422 --> 1:06:02.992
You know, right now
you're just another face,

1:06:03.059 --> 1:06:04.561
you know, until she says,

1:06:04.627 --> 1:06:07.163
"Dad, this guy's
really special to me,"

1:06:07.230 --> 1:06:11.301
is when I would change
in my mind, you know?

1:06:11.367 --> 1:06:12.535
- Her word's
everything to you.

1:06:12.602 --> 1:06:14.604
- Yeah, exactly--exactly.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1:06:14.671 --> 1:06:16.039
That makes complete sense.
I think it's just--

1:06:16.105 --> 1:06:18.208
- So if she gives me
a good word when I shake

1:06:18.274 --> 1:06:20.777
your hand when you leave,
I'll pat ya on the arm, okay?

1:06:20.844 --> 1:06:22.846
- That's--that's--
I'll take that.

1:06:22.912 --> 1:06:24.247
- Nice meeting you,
nice talking to you.

1:06:24.314 --> 1:06:26.115
- Absolutely, it was
great talking to you as well.

1:06:26.182 --> 1:06:27.951
<i>Rachel's father not</i>
<i>giving me his blessing</i>

1:06:28.051 --> 1:06:29.419
<i>is totally understandable.</i>

1:06:29.486 --> 1:06:33.022
He needs to talk with Rachel
first, and I respect that.

1:06:33.089 --> 1:06:34.724
<i>With a father that,</i>
<i>I mean, that cares so much</i>

1:06:34.791 --> 1:06:36.759
about his daughter,
wants to be protective,

1:06:36.826 --> 1:06:39.329
wants what's best for her,
it all makes sense.

1:06:39.395 --> 1:06:42.432
<i>But it's still disappointing</i>
<i>to not get his approval.</i>

1:06:42.499 --> 1:06:44.467
- You know
that I would not be here.

1:06:44.534 --> 1:06:45.668
- I know you, baby.

1:06:45.735 --> 1:06:46.836
- I would not be putting
you guys through this.

1:06:46.903 --> 1:06:49.572
- I know this.
- If it wasn't real.

1:06:49.639 --> 1:06:52.509
And when we were in Croatia,
I did tell him I was

1:06:52.575 --> 1:06:54.744
falling in love with him,
and I really am.

1:06:54.811 --> 1:06:56.946
- Mm-hmm.
- [laughs]

1:06:57.013 --> 1:06:58.781
I know.

1:06:58.848 --> 1:07:02.952
The thing about him is, like,
I've never met someone who,

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:06.456
like, truly, I feel like, sees
me and, like, has showed me

1:07:06.523 --> 1:07:09.392
that there's a possibility
of someone who could...

1:07:09.459 --> 1:07:11.794
- Be with you instead
of in front of you.

1:07:11.861 --> 1:07:15.265
- Yeah, but everyone
I've ever brought home,

1:07:15.331 --> 1:07:16.933
you were not that nice.

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.601
- I am not, I am not.

1:07:18.668 --> 1:07:21.237
- You have been so mean!
- I know.

1:07:21.304 --> 1:07:22.405
- Did you like him?

1:07:22.472 --> 1:07:23.573
Like, what did you think
about him?

1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:25.475
- Yeah, I think--thought
he was very nice.

1:07:25.542 --> 1:07:29.345
And, you know, he seems
like, he agrees that you would,

1:07:29.412 --> 1:07:31.147
you know, that he would
stand next to you, so...

1:07:31.214 --> 1:07:33.917
- I just, like, feel like,
you know, that, like,

1:07:33.983 --> 1:07:37.787
your opinion has always, like,
meant the most to me.

1:07:37.854 --> 1:07:38.988
- Yeah.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:41.558
- And I've always just--
- I love you, baby.

1:07:41.624 --> 1:07:43.359
- I've always wanted you
to be proud of me.

1:07:43.426 --> 1:07:44.861
- I'm very proud of you.

1:07:44.928 --> 1:07:46.763
I'm only afraid
of you getting hurt.

1:07:46.829 --> 1:07:51.234
But if he's what you want,
I'm all for it.

1:07:51.301 --> 1:07:53.770
- I just feel, like,
very grateful that

1:07:53.836 --> 1:07:56.339
you guys are, like,
accepting him and, you know,

1:07:56.406 --> 1:07:57.807
you're not--you're
not being mean to him.

1:07:57.874 --> 1:07:59.509
[laughs]

1:07:59.576 --> 1:08:02.612
That's why I'm the happiest,
because I really

1:08:02.679 --> 1:08:04.914
thought you were
gonna be mean to him.

1:08:04.981 --> 1:08:06.349
- Yeah.

1:08:06.416 --> 1:08:08.418
- You're like, yeah, I
know you probably thought that.

1:08:08.484 --> 1:08:10.019
- I wasn't mean,
I was a really good guy.

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:11.287
- [laughs]

1:08:11.354 --> 1:08:13.289
<i>- Well, I seen my daughter</i>

1:08:13.356 --> 1:08:15.558
<i>happier than I've seen her</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

1:08:15.625 --> 1:08:19.028
You know, she said that I was
different, and I was,

1:08:19.095 --> 1:08:20.763
<i>because, you know, you--</i>

1:08:20.830 --> 1:08:22.865
<i>your whole life</i>
<i>is around your children,</i>

1:08:22.932 --> 1:08:25.234
and she was happy, so I
wasn't gonna do anything

1:08:25.301 --> 1:08:27.236
to spoil the party.

1:08:27.303 --> 1:08:28.905
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

1:08:28.972 --> 1:08:30.206
It was really great
talking to you.

1:08:30.273 --> 1:08:31.708
- Yeah, I'm not a hugger,
but nice meeting you.

1:08:31.774 --> 1:08:33.376
- It was really great
talking to you.

1:08:33.443 --> 1:08:34.811
<i>Rachel's dad did say,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

1:08:34.877 --> 1:08:36.946
<i>if I speak with her</i>
<i>and I feel that, you know,</i>

1:08:37.013 --> 1:08:39.782
<i>you are someone that's worthy</i>
<i>of marrying my daughter,</i>

1:08:39.849 --> 1:08:41.718
<i>like, I'll shake your hand</i>
<i>and pat you on the arm.</i>

1:08:41.784 --> 1:08:44.621
<i>And that's what he ended</i>
<i>up doing, so overall,</i>

1:08:44.687 --> 1:08:46.356
like, the day
was a huge success.

1:08:46.422 --> 1:08:48.491
- Bye, guys. Have fun.

1:08:48.558 --> 1:08:50.893
<i>- I see a future</i>
<i>more than ever,</i>

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:52.762
like, than I ever have
with Rachel, like,

1:08:52.829 --> 1:08:55.531
I don't know if today
could've went any better.

1:08:55.598 --> 1:08:59.736
- I just want you to know that

1:08:59.802 --> 1:09:03.673
I truly feel like tonight

1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:07.777
makes me feel even stronger for
you if that's even possible.

1:09:07.844 --> 1:09:10.380
But to be able to see you
with, like,

1:09:10.446 --> 1:09:13.182
my friends and family,
you truly have like,

1:09:13.249 --> 1:09:15.485
no idea
what tonight meant to me.

1:09:15.551 --> 1:09:17.987
And for them to meet
you and see me

1:09:18.054 --> 1:09:21.190
and just know that
what we have is different.

1:09:21.257 --> 1:09:23.059
And that's what I felt
the whole time.

1:09:23.126 --> 1:09:25.428
[whispering]
It just means so much to me,

1:09:25.495 --> 1:09:27.897
and...

1:09:27.964 --> 1:09:30.600
if I was falling for you
before,

1:09:30.667 --> 1:09:33.236
I'm falling even harder
for you now.

1:09:33.302 --> 1:09:34.904
And I would never
bring you here

1:09:34.971 --> 1:09:37.440
or put you through that

1:09:37.507 --> 1:09:40.376
if I truly didn't see us
at the end of this,

1:09:40.443 --> 1:09:42.145
and I told them that.

1:09:42.211 --> 1:09:43.613
I truly do.

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:45.148
- Yeah, being able to meet
the people

1:09:45.214 --> 1:09:46.649
that mean so much to you,

1:09:46.716 --> 1:09:49.585
