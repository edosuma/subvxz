WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.443 --> 00:12.378
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.380 --> 00:14.780
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.782 --> 00:17.483
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.485 --> 00:19.284
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.286 --> 00:22.454
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.456 --> 00:25.190
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.192 --> 00:29.361
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.363 --> 00:32.564
-¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
-¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:32.566 --> 00:36.535
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.537 --> 00:38.037
¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:38.039 --> 00:41.507
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:41.509 --> 00:42.841
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.843 --> 00:45.377
-¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
-¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.379 --> 00:51.417
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the First ¶

00:57.491 --> 01:00.426
¶¶

01:09.570 --> 01:12.504
Mr. Cedric! I've been
looking everywhere for you.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.606
Can you help me
with this school assignment?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.708
I need to do a magic spell
that will shrink

01:16.710 --> 01:18.710
a watermelon down
to the size of a grape.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.846
A shrinking spell.
Right, right.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.115
Not just
any shrinking spell.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.617
This one uses Dwindle Dust,
and my teachers say

01:25.619 --> 01:27.786
it's so powerful
we can only do the spell

01:27.788 --> 01:30.055
with help from a sorcerer,
meaning you.

01:30.057 --> 01:33.625
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
dwindle... the teacher's...
shrinking... sorcerer.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.761
Mr. Cedric, are you okay?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.696
No, I am not okay!

01:37.698 --> 01:39.631
My sister is coming
for a visit.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.433
Oh! How fun!

01:41.435 --> 01:44.570
No, Sofia,
not fun... at all.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.572
(horse neighs)

01:46.574 --> 01:51.977
Sofia! Uncle Ceddy!
My two favorite people!

01:51.979 --> 01:54.446
-Hi, Calista!
-Where is your mother?

01:54.448 --> 01:57.416
Or did she perhaps decide
to stay home after all?

01:57.418 --> 02:00.652
Not to worry, dear brother,
I made it safe and sound.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.721
You, on the other hand,

02:02.723 --> 02:05.724
look like you've just walked
through a windstorm.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.660
Have you forgotten how to cast
a simple ironing spell?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.329
I know five of them!

02:10.331 --> 02:12.731
Well, perhaps you
should practice them.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.299
I could help you,
if you like!

02:14.301 --> 02:16.168
I do not need
to practice!

02:16.170 --> 02:18.337
Oh, don't be
embarrassed, Cedric.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.740
I know you find most spells
rather tricky to pull off.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.576
-That is not--
-How long will you be staying
with us, Miss Cordelia?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.078
-A few days?
-Oh, no, no, no.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.513
It'll take quite some time

02:27.515 --> 02:30.082
for our castle
to undergo renovations.

02:30.084 --> 02:32.618
Which means we're going
to be here weeks,

02:32.620 --> 02:33.986
maybe even months!

02:33.988 --> 02:36.688
It'll be just like
the old days.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.525
Mummy and Uncle Ceddy
grew up here in the castle.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.627
Yes! Back when your grandfather
was king,

02:41.629 --> 02:44.530
and our father, Goodwin,
was the royal sorcerer.

02:44.532 --> 02:48.300
You know, I never saw him
bungle one spell.

02:48.302 --> 02:53.105
Are you trying to say
that I bungle spells,
dear sister?

02:53.107 --> 02:54.773
Maybe we can help
with your luggage?

02:54.775 --> 02:56.842
I'll take care of it.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.477
Unloadio, rip--

02:58.479 --> 03:01.113
Don't trouble
yourself, Cedric.

03:01.115 --> 03:03.148
We have some rather
delicate items,

03:03.150 --> 03:07.052
magic mirrors and such,
and I don't want them
dropped or broken.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.454
No, wait! I know
an excellent spell

03:09.456 --> 03:11.190
that will unpack
your bags!

03:11.192 --> 03:13.125
But I know
a better one!

03:14.662 --> 03:16.562
¶ Wanna see some luggage fly ¶

03:16.564 --> 03:18.030
¶ I've got a spell for that ¶

03:18.032 --> 03:20.132
¶ It will zoom around the room ¶

03:20.134 --> 03:22.034
¶ Just like an acrobat ¶

03:22.036 --> 03:24.970
¶ Feel free to cheer and gush ¶

03:24.972 --> 03:29.041
¶ I've got the magic touch ¶

03:29.043 --> 03:31.643
¶ Though you may know
some spells and charms ¶

03:31.645 --> 03:33.478
¶ You're not the only one ¶

03:33.480 --> 03:35.414
¶ Why don't I
unload the bags? ¶

03:35.416 --> 03:37.182
¶ Hold on,
I'm nearly done ¶

03:37.184 --> 03:40.252
¶ Why must you always rush ¶

03:40.254 --> 03:42.721
¶ My brilliant magic touch? ¶

03:44.592 --> 03:46.425
¶ Wave your wand ¶

03:46.427 --> 03:47.826
¶ Chant your charms ¶

03:47.828 --> 03:51.597
¶ Just do it far from me ¶

03:51.599 --> 03:53.732
¶ You might cause harm ¶

03:53.734 --> 03:56.201
¶ Set off alarms ¶

03:56.203 --> 03:59.738
¶ With faulty sorcery ¶

03:59.740 --> 04:03.675
¶ Magic is not
to be taken lightly ¶

04:03.677 --> 04:07.546
¶ Lest you conjure things
quite unsightly ¶

04:07.548 --> 04:10.115
¶ Take it
from someone who knows ¶

04:10.117 --> 04:14.353
¶ Best leave the magic ¶

04:14.355 --> 04:16.855
¶ To the pros ¶

04:16.857 --> 04:18.357
Uh, like me.

04:18.359 --> 04:22.427
¶ I'm the royal sorcerer
and I demand respect ¶

04:22.429 --> 04:24.229
¶ Let's be real,
with you in charge ¶

04:24.231 --> 04:26.265
¶ The place
will end up wrecked ¶

04:26.267 --> 04:28.967
¶ I'm certain of this much ¶

04:28.969 --> 04:32.237
¶ You have no magic touch ¶

04:32.239 --> 04:37.042
(growls) ¶ She always wants
to put me down ¶

04:37.044 --> 04:40.879
¶ Even right
before the king ¶

04:40.881 --> 04:42.814
¶ With all her taunts ¶

04:42.816 --> 04:44.316
¶ When she's around ¶

04:44.318 --> 04:48.654
¶ They all think
I can't do a thing ¶

04:48.656 --> 04:52.224
¶ Magic is not to be
taken lightly ¶

04:52.226 --> 04:56.094
¶ Lest you conjure things
quite unsightly ¶

04:56.096 --> 04:58.664
¶ Take it
from someone who knows ¶

04:58.666 --> 05:03.669
¶ You're the reason
for all of my woes ¶

05:03.671 --> 05:06.305
¶ My talent
just grows and grows ¶

05:06.307 --> 05:10.309
¶ So leave the magic ¶

05:10.311 --> 05:12.978
¶ To the pros ¶

05:30.130 --> 05:34.433
Now, settle into your room,
Calista, and I'll see
everyone at dinner.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.839
This will be
just like old times!

05:40.841 --> 05:44.943
-That's what
I'm afraid of.
-What do you mean?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.945
My own sister doesn't think
I can cast

05:46.947 --> 05:48.547
the simplest of magic spells,

05:48.549 --> 05:49.948
and now that she's living here,

05:49.950 --> 05:51.850
she'll be telling me so
every day!

05:51.852 --> 05:54.353
Oh, just like she did
when we were children.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.188
Soon enough, she'll be
taking over my workshop

05:56.190 --> 05:57.556
and meddling in my work,

05:57.558 --> 05:59.291
telling me I'm not chewing
my food thoroughly

05:59.293 --> 06:02.728
or combing my hair
the right way. (groans)

06:02.730 --> 06:05.130
Poor Uncle Ceddy.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.399
I wish Mummy
wasn't so hard on him.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.800
That doesn't seem fair.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.670
Sure, Mr. Cedric sometimes
messes things up,

06:11.672 --> 06:14.239
but I've seen him do
lots of great magic.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.942
Not in front
of my mum, he doesn't.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.848
(gasps) That's it!

06:22.850 --> 06:26.051
We should tell your mother
about all the incredible magic

06:26.053 --> 06:27.586
we've seen Mr. Cedric do,

06:27.588 --> 06:29.888
and then she'll have
to be nicer to him!

06:29.890 --> 06:32.591
It's worth a try.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.927
Mummy's new room
is down here.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.997
(all gasping)

06:38.999 --> 06:42.667
What are you girls doing
lurking around like that?

06:42.669 --> 06:44.870
Can't a sorceress
get a little privacy?

06:44.872 --> 06:46.772
Yes, of-- of course. Sorry!

06:49.543 --> 06:51.777
Is everything
all right, girls?

06:51.779 --> 06:55.247
We were just trying
to tell Miss Cordelia
about Mr. Cedric and...

06:55.249 --> 06:56.915
We saw her hair.

06:56.917 --> 07:01.853
Ooh. That. I think
I can explain.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.022
This is such
a nice picture!

07:04.024 --> 07:05.891
Mummy's hair
is so long!

07:05.893 --> 07:08.360
And Mr. Cedric
looks so happy.

07:08.362 --> 07:11.430
Well, he and Cordelia
were very close back then.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.632
My mummy
and Uncle Ceddy?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.634
They were
practically inseparable.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.904
If they used to be close,
maybe they can be close again!

07:18.906 --> 07:21.306
I... don't think
that's possible, Sofia,

07:21.308 --> 07:23.909
not after the incident.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.811
What incident?

07:25.813 --> 07:28.547
Well, it happened
many years ago,

07:28.549 --> 07:30.816
soon after this portrait
was painted.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.419
It was the day
of Cordelia's Sorceress Ball.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.487
Sorceress Ball?

07:35.489 --> 07:37.255
That's a super-fancy party

07:37.257 --> 07:39.458
on a sorceress's
tenth birthday.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.293
The ball
was just beginning,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.662
and young Cordelia
was about to make

07:43.664 --> 07:46.898
her big entrance,
when all of a sudden--

07:46.900 --> 07:48.834
Excuse me,
Your Majesty.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.903
Oh, don't tell me.
What, the elf situation again?

07:51.905 --> 07:53.505
Oh, I'm afraid so.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.740
You're needed right away
in the throne room.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.409
(sighs)
I'm sorry, girls.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.911
We'll have to finish
our talk later.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.848
But, Dad, what was
the incident?!

08:02.850 --> 08:07.486
(sighs) Now how are we going
to find out what happened?

08:07.488 --> 08:09.421
I know how
we can find out!

08:09.423 --> 08:12.491
We can use
my Looking Back Glass.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.193
Mummy gave it to me
for my birthday!

08:15.195 --> 08:17.095
It's loaded with magic!

08:17.097 --> 08:18.497
What can it do?

08:18.499 --> 08:20.599
For starters, it will
show you things

08:20.601 --> 08:22.801
that happened a long,
long time ago.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.604
Like your mother's
Sorceress Ball!

08:25.606 --> 08:27.105
(gasps) There it is!

08:27.107 --> 08:28.306
And that's not all.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.943
Take my hand.
Entamo reflecto!

08:31.945 --> 08:33.612
It's Mummy's ball!

08:33.614 --> 08:35.180
All these years ago!

08:35.182 --> 08:38.617
It looks like every sorcerer
and royal in the land is here.

08:38.619 --> 08:42.120
(gasps) There's
Mr. Cedric's father,
Goodwin the Great!

08:42.122 --> 08:44.789
And my grandfather,
King Roland the First!

08:44.791 --> 08:45.824
I never met him!

08:45.826 --> 08:48.159
And... that's my dad!

08:48.161 --> 08:49.961
Only he's a kid!

08:49.963 --> 08:52.063
Wow, he looks
younger than me.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.698
Dad! Over here!

08:53.700 --> 08:56.334
He can't hear you,
Sofia, no one can.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.904
That's the way
the Looking Back Glass works.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.339
We get to see everything,
but they can't see us.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.974
Wait, something's happening!

09:02.976 --> 09:05.477
Maybe it's... the incident!

09:05.479 --> 09:07.746
No, it's just
my Aunt Tilly.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.481
Look how young she is!

09:09.483 --> 09:11.349
This party
is whiz-bang!

09:11.351 --> 09:16.054
That is not the kind of behavior
we expect from our future queen.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.392
Future queen?
But Aunt Tilly
never became queen.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.027
There's Mummy
and Uncle Ceddy!

09:22.029 --> 09:23.094
Let's go!

09:26.166 --> 09:28.567
(frustrated cries)

09:28.569 --> 09:31.036
I need<i> something </i>
to make my dress glow

09:31.038 --> 09:34.039
or sparkle,
or glow<i> and</i> sparkle!

09:34.041 --> 09:35.407
Will this help?

09:35.409 --> 09:36.908
It might, Ceddy!

09:38.178 --> 09:40.612
Attiro rococo!

09:42.015 --> 09:44.749
You look smashing, Cordy!

09:44.751 --> 09:47.752
Smashing enough to make
a big entrance at the ball?

09:47.754 --> 09:48.853
I think so.

09:48.855 --> 09:52.357
Well, I don't.
Not yet, at least.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.659
Tresses updo-o!

09:55.963 --> 09:58.863
Now we're getting somewhere.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.131
(fanfare playing)

10:00.133 --> 10:01.533
The trumpets, Cordy!

10:01.535 --> 10:03.735
It's time for you
to go out there!

10:03.737 --> 10:05.236
I-I can't!

10:05.238 --> 10:09.040
Oh, Ceddy,
what if my grand entrance
isn't grand enough?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.743
Maybe we should
just cancel the ball.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.144
You can't do that, Cordy.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.580
You've been waiting
for it all year!

10:15.582 --> 10:19.985
I'm not going out there
unless I can really
wow everyone.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.822
I know the perfect spell, Cordy!

10:23.824 --> 10:27.392
I can use smoxeum to create
a big blast of colorful smoke

10:27.394 --> 10:29.127
just as you step out.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.998
It'll be the grandest entrance
anyone's ever seen!

10:33.000 --> 10:35.767
But you can't cast
a spell like that, Ceddy.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.402
You're too young.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.071
I can do it!
I really can. Watch!

10:40.073 --> 10:43.208
Watch. Explosio sublimo!

10:45.012 --> 10:48.179
Eek! This is marvelous!

10:48.181 --> 10:50.415
Cedric, you're a genius,

10:50.417 --> 10:53.618
and the best brother
a sorceress could ask for.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.588
All right, I'm ready!
...I think.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.993
-(bottle clatters)
-Oops! Still a little nervous.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.762
Don't worry, Cordelia!

11:03.764 --> 11:08.533
This will be one Sorceress Ball
no one will ever forget!

11:11.104 --> 11:13.505
Explosio sublimo!

11:13.507 --> 11:15.507
(applause)

11:17.044 --> 11:19.377
Thank you, thank you.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.480
Yes, the look is
quite fabulous, isn't it?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.549
(gasps)

11:26.953 --> 11:30.055
So that's what happened
to Mummy's hair!

11:30.057 --> 11:33.224
Cordelia, your hair!

11:33.226 --> 11:37.228
No. No! It can't be!

11:37.230 --> 11:40.398
This is all your fault!

11:40.400 --> 11:42.901
Uh, I have no idea
how that happened,

11:42.903 --> 11:45.136
but I can fix it.
I can fix it!

11:45.138 --> 11:48.039
Uh, undo-o immediate-o!

11:48.041 --> 11:51.843
Stop! You're making
it worse!

11:51.845 --> 11:53.078
(sobbing)

11:53.080 --> 11:56.381
Oh, he's a bit of a bungler
after all, isn't he?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.416
Not much of a sorcerer, is he?

11:58.418 --> 12:00.685
Nothing at all
like his father.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.254
No! Stop saying those things!

12:03.256 --> 12:04.889
It's not true.

12:04.891 --> 12:08.326
Oh, Merlin's mushrooms!

12:08.328 --> 12:10.829
I think that
was the incident.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.933
Out-o reflecto!

12:14.935 --> 12:17.001
I can't believe
what we just saw!

12:17.003 --> 12:20.338
-CEDRIC: Believe it, Sofia.
-Mr. Cedric, did you see--?

12:20.340 --> 12:24.342
Everything. I saw everything.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.911
My life was never the same
after that day.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.681
Everyone in the kingdom,
Cordelia, my father,

12:29.683 --> 12:33.384
your father, from that day on
they've all thought of me

12:33.386 --> 12:36.454
as Cedric the Bungler,
and the worst part is

12:36.456 --> 12:38.957
it was not my fault!

12:38.959 --> 12:41.226
-What do you mean?
-Well, you saw.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.194
I was able to do
the magic smoke spell

12:43.196 --> 12:45.263
perfectly the first time
I tried it.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.899
It's simple. You just
sprinkle the smoke serum

12:47.901 --> 12:49.267
and say the right words.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.536
There's no way I could've
messed it up!

12:51.538 --> 12:53.872
But what happened
to Miss Cordelia's hair?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.140
Oh, it doesn't matter.

12:55.142 --> 12:58.276
Everyone will always
believe it was my fault.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.279
That horrible day
has haunted me my whole life,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.548
just as it's haunted
your mother.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.750
No one could ever fix
her hair, you know,

13:05.752 --> 13:07.252
not even my father.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.155
Poor Mummy!

13:10.157 --> 13:12.056
Well, I don't think
you're a bungler.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.558
You're a great sorcerer.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.560
That's why I asked
for your help with my homework.

13:15.562 --> 13:19.164
Well, I think
it's high time we tackle
that assignment, Sofia.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.366
Here we are. Oh!

13:23.436 --> 13:25.303
What are you
doing in here?

13:25.305 --> 13:29.307
Just tidying up
your messy workshop, Cedric.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.443
Those are my eyes of newt.
Where are you putting them?

13:32.445 --> 13:34.412
In here
with your other newt parts!

13:34.414 --> 13:37.348
You, silly brother,
had them with your eyes
of dragons.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.851
Of course I did.
Eyes go with eyes.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.187
Ugh. Newt goes with newt.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.189
That's ridiculous.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.358
What's ridiculous
is how disorganized
you keep this place.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.662
It's no wonder you have
so much trouble casting spells.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.431
(gibbers) Cordelia,
I cast plenty of spells.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.200
In fact, I'm about
to help Sofia

13:55.202 --> 13:58.436
with a very important spell
for her royal homework,

13:58.438 --> 14:02.507
so I kindly ask that you
will keep out of our way.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.043
Sofia, if you please.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.377
(grunts)

14:06.379 --> 14:08.513
So, we need to shrink
a watermelon

14:08.515 --> 14:10.148
down to the size of a grape.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.450
First ingredient,
grape seeds.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.453
Yes, yes, yes, I keep those
right over here--

14:15.455 --> 14:17.722
Cordelia, where have you
put my seeds?

14:17.724 --> 14:20.225
I placed them tidily
in that drawer.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.033
Oh, not that drawer.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.269
That's where I put
your creepy critters.

14:34.908 --> 14:38.843
Cordelia, your tidying
is causing nothing but trouble.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.245
I can't find
what I need

14:40.247 --> 14:42.413
to help Princess Sofia
with her homework.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.482
Oh, I think
I have a solution.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.851
I will be happy
to help you, Sofia.

14:46.853 --> 14:49.520
No, thank you.
I already asked Mr. Cedric.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.223
I don't mind at all,
and this way you won't have

14:52.225 --> 14:54.259
to worry about Cedric
botching things.

14:54.261 --> 14:59.497
I heard that, Cordelia,
and I shall be the one
helping Sofia.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.133
Nonsense, I'll do it.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.338
Here are the grape seeds.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.340
Grape seeds!

15:09.342 --> 15:12.010
But that's twice
as much as it needs!

15:12.012 --> 15:14.979
-I'll get the unicorn hair.
-I've already got it!

15:18.418 --> 15:20.952
Stop, both of you, please!

15:20.954 --> 15:23.588
Oh, please get the Dwindle Dust?
I'd be happy to!

15:23.590 --> 15:25.423
Not before I do!

15:31.731 --> 15:34.165
Wait! Dwindle Dust
is very powerful!

15:36.937 --> 15:39.103
And now for the magic words!

15:39.105 --> 15:40.305
Retuso extremis!

15:46.479 --> 15:47.745
It didn't shrink.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.981
Well, something
must've gone wrong.

15:49.983 --> 15:53.284
Well, of course it did,
because you're here.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.387
That's it! I am through
with your insults, Cordelia,

15:56.389 --> 15:58.389
and I am through with you.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.626
I am leaving.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.262
Ow!

16:04.264 --> 16:07.265
What did you do
to my door?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.399
I didn't do a thing!

16:08.401 --> 16:10.435
But I walk
through here every day

16:10.437 --> 16:11.502
without hitting my head.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.271
(crashing)

16:13.273 --> 16:16.574
No, Mr. Cedric,
I think the door's shrinking!

16:16.576 --> 16:20.578
And this scroll. It used
to be larger, didn't it?

16:20.580 --> 16:23.514
BOTH (gasping):
Merlin's mushrooms!

16:23.516 --> 16:25.583
Something went wrong
with the spell,

16:25.585 --> 16:28.186
and instead
of shrinking
your watermelon...

16:28.188 --> 16:31.789
...it's shrinking the castle
and everything in it!

16:31.791 --> 16:33.458
(crashing)

16:33.460 --> 16:36.260
-Oh, no!
-Even us?

16:36.262 --> 16:38.997
No, Calista, Dwindle Dust
doesn't affect people.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.133
It's everything else
that will get very, very tiny.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.936
Until the entire castle
is the size of a grape!

16:44.938 --> 16:47.372
-Can you fix it?
-Of course.
I know a counter-charm.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.941
No, don't be silly.
I'll have to fix this myself.

16:49.943 --> 16:53.378
Please, somebody fix the castle
before it's too late!

16:53.380 --> 16:54.512
I intend to!

16:54.514 --> 16:56.447
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.851
They'll never fix the castle
if they don't stop fighting.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.386
Trust me.
I can do it.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.355
The last time
I trusted you,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.958
you did this!

17:06.960 --> 17:10.495
For the millionth time,
that was not my fault!

17:10.497 --> 17:12.463
I said the magic words
perfectly!

17:12.465 --> 17:14.565
Something else
must've gone wrong

17:14.567 --> 17:16.134
with that purple smoke serum,

17:16.136 --> 17:17.902
but I am not to blame!

17:17.904 --> 17:20.405
Did he say
"purple smoke serum"?

17:20.407 --> 17:21.806
I thought it was white.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.475
It started off purple,
I'm sure of it!

17:24.477 --> 17:27.211
Maybe something did happen
to the smoke serum,

17:27.213 --> 17:30.648
and maybe the incident
wasn't Mr. Cedric's fault,
after all!

17:30.650 --> 17:33.518
Just admit you messed up
that smoke spell

17:33.520 --> 17:36.487
like you messed up
this shrinking spell, Cedric!

17:36.489 --> 17:39.424
Well, if we want them
to stop fighting
and fix the castle...

17:39.426 --> 17:41.159
...we'd better go find out.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.062
Father and Mother always bought
you brand-new wands,

17:44.064 --> 17:47.999
and, lucky me, I was left
with your hand-me-downs.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.504
(crashing)

17:54.541 --> 17:56.441
Oh, no, the mirror!

17:56.443 --> 17:58.242
It's half its size!

17:58.244 --> 18:00.344
Well, as long
as it still works.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.613
Show us
that Sorceress Ball again.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.016
Entamo reflecto!

18:05.018 --> 18:08.519
Eek! This is marvelous!

18:08.521 --> 18:10.555
Cedric, you're a genius.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.791
See? The magic smoke serum
is purple!

18:13.793 --> 18:16.194
But I don't think
it stays that way.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.195
Keep watching.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.298
He's putting it down...

18:20.300 --> 18:22.934
All right, I'm ready!
...I think.

18:22.936 --> 18:27.271
Oops! Still
a little nervous.

18:27.273 --> 18:32.944
(gasps) Look! She spilled
her fancy hair potion
into the smoke serum!

18:32.946 --> 18:35.379
And they didn't
see it happen!

18:35.381 --> 18:37.482
And that's why
the spell went wrong!

18:37.484 --> 18:39.283
Don't worry, Cordelia,

18:39.285 --> 18:43.387
this will be one Sorceress Ball
no one will ever forget!

18:43.389 --> 18:46.624
No, Mummy,
don't go out there!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.593
She can't hear you, remember?

18:48.595 --> 18:51.729
At least this Cordelia can't.
We've got to go back.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.297
Out-o reflecto!

18:54.634 --> 18:56.734
Things have shrunk
even more!

18:56.736 --> 18:58.569
We've got to hurry.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.813
Oh! The ceiling
is getting lower!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.815
And the walls
are getting closer!

19:10.817 --> 19:12.316
Keep going!

19:17.690 --> 19:20.791
Hurry, or we won't
make it through!

19:20.793 --> 19:23.528
CORDELIA: Just admit
you messed up
that smoke spell

19:23.530 --> 19:25.863
like you messed up
that shrinking spell!

19:25.865 --> 19:29.200
I could stop the shrinking
if you could stay out
of my space!

19:29.202 --> 19:31.669
Believe me,
I'd like nothing more.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.005
You both have
to see something right away!

19:34.007 --> 19:37.708
Show us right before Uncle Ceddy
cast his magic smoke spell.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.478
I'd rather not watch
myself get humiliated--

19:40.480 --> 19:43.548
Ooh! Look how beautiful
my hair was!

19:43.550 --> 19:46.951
All right, I'm ready!
...I think.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.187
Watch the smoke
serum carefully.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.657
Oops! Still
a little nervous.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.493
Oh! I bumped the table.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.228
And mixed the potions.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.698
And that's why the magic smoke
changed my hair!

20:00.700 --> 20:03.701
It was my fault
the spell went wrong.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.570
I was the bungler.

20:05.572 --> 20:10.374
And you blamed me
all these years!

20:10.376 --> 20:12.243
Mr. Cedric didn't
mess up that spell.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.412
He's a great sorcerer
who has an idea

20:14.414 --> 20:16.547
how to stop this castle
from shrinking,

20:16.549 --> 20:17.815
don't you, Mr. Cedric?

20:17.817 --> 20:19.717
-I do.
-Then do it, Ceddy.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.420
-I believe in you.
-Do you really mean that?

20:22.422 --> 20:24.555
-Yes, I do.
-(creaking)

20:24.557 --> 20:26.390
Mr. Cedric, we have
to hurry!

20:26.392 --> 20:30.394
Well, you can
only stop Dwindle Dust
with more Dwindle Dust!

20:30.396 --> 20:32.997
We still have some.
Second drawer from the left.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.066
Allow me, Cordy.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.936
I can't quite reach!

20:38.938 --> 20:40.371
Oh, it's too small,

20:40.373 --> 20:42.240
and my fingers
are too big!

20:49.782 --> 20:51.549
-Got it.
-Good girl.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.618
Now, hand the Dwindle Dust
to your uncle.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.422
From Dwindle Dust
to mighty brew,

20:58.424 --> 21:01.826
undo this spell
we never meant to do!

21:06.566 --> 21:09.133
Oh, you did it, Cedric!

21:09.135 --> 21:11.102
Yes, I did, didn't I?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.703
Of course you did.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.439
You know, you're
a pretty great sorcerer.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.642
Which I should've seen
all along.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.645
Cedric, what have you
done to the castle?

21:20.647 --> 21:23.814
Actually, I can explain,
Your Majesty.

21:23.816 --> 21:27.818
I caused the castle to shrink,
and Cedric fixed it.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.721
Well, that is not
what I was expecting to hear.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.624
Ahem, uh,
thank you, Cedric.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.727
You shouldn't assume everything
is his fault, you know.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.830
Well, that's strange to hear,
coming from you.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.733
Well, I learned
something today.

21:42.735 --> 21:46.103
Yes. Mr. Cedric didn't
really cause the incident.

21:46.105 --> 21:48.806
-Hmm!
-It's true. I did.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.108
And, Cordy, now that we know
which two potions

21:51.110 --> 21:54.312
caused the spell to go wrong,
we can finally fix your hair!

21:54.314 --> 21:56.614
Oh, can we?
Can we really?

21:56.616 --> 21:59.850
-I believe so.
-Oh, Ceddy, hurry.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.753
Mixed-up potions,
mistaken brew,

22:02.755 --> 22:05.823
grow my sister's
hair anew!

22:08.695 --> 22:13.130
It's back!
Oh, my lovely hair is back!

22:13.132 --> 22:14.999
Well done, Cedric.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.768
Thank you,
sire, and Sofia,

22:17.770 --> 22:20.504
I believe we still have
some homework to do.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.874
Great, but maybe this time
we should try it outside?

22:23.876 --> 22:27.144
I think that would be
a very good idea, princess.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.013
Come along, everyone.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.555
