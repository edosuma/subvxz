WEBVTT

00:20.779 --> 00:22.240
The Redeemer,

00:23.449 --> 00:27.702
like The Lord our God above, shall
destroy them with a mighty destruction

00:27.702 --> 00:30.163
until they all be destroyed!

00:31.831 --> 00:34.709
Through God's teachings
we can be the Monster Truck.

00:34.709 --> 00:37.796
We can smush the things
that the devil puts in our way.

00:40.508 --> 00:43.219
- Now, can I get an Amen?
- Amen!

00:49.307 --> 00:51.101
Y'all know I don't like to cuss,

00:51.101 --> 00:55.188
but what in the hell is this horse
shit I am looking at right now?

00:55.188 --> 00:58.901
- Momma said the S word.
- This has nothing to do with church.

00:58.901 --> 01:02.529
He's making us look like fools. Talking
about we can be like a monster truck.

01:02.529 --> 01:05.116
I can't believe y'all let him
pull this Hot Wheels mess.

01:05.116 --> 01:08.451
A good turnout at least.
Avery profitable Friday night.

01:08.451 --> 01:12.163
That's got to count for something.
Putting butts in the seats.

01:12.163 --> 01:15.834
Money ain't everything, baby. What
we gonna do, start selling beer next?

01:15.834 --> 01:19.380
Get your ice cold beer, here!
Beer, beer, beer!

01:19.921 --> 01:24.467
Get your ice cold beer!
Beer, beer, beer!

01:34.770 --> 01:37.982
You. You're nothing but a fool.

01:37.982 --> 01:41.902
Pretending on TV to be all kind
and caring. But I know the truth.

01:42.987 --> 01:45.614
- May-May?
- Damn you to hell, Aimee-Leigh!

01:52.955 --> 01:55.665
Somebody help me,
she's trying to kill me!

01:56.333 --> 02:01.297
Help Me! Help! Help me!
She's trying to kill me!

02:18.730 --> 02:21.983
You think I'd just live with it?
What you done to my family?!

02:21.983 --> 02:23.986
Please, May-May.
This ain't the way.

02:23.986 --> 02:26.321
Now it's your turn to feel...

02:29.951 --> 02:32.244
What the hell? I'm sorry.

02:55.517 --> 02:58.311
We are the elite
of the Evangelical world.

02:59.272 --> 03:02.400
Our capes embrace us
like the arms of Jesus Christ.

03:03.776 --> 03:06.320
We wear it in celebration of His love.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.866
The pistol gives the power
to take life.

03:09.866 --> 03:12.951
The Lord gave us free will
to do as we choose.

03:12.951 --> 03:17.456
Thusly, it is a righteous man who
wears the pistol, yet does no evil.

03:18.374 --> 03:23.754
Under the eyes of God we are
the men of the Cape and Pistol Society.

03:31.804 --> 03:34.055
How you enjoying your retirement, Eli?

03:34.055 --> 03:37.976
Oh, he ain't retired. He's writing
books, he's doing press.

03:38.518 --> 03:41.272
Admit it, Eli,
you can't stay ou the spotlight.

03:41.272 --> 03:45.525
No, you better believe
I'm gonna be fishin' and sippin'.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.820
Fishin' and sippin.' You're
scared your kids're gonna blow it.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.574
Pretty much.

04:04.879 --> 04:11.135
Glory to, to Zion.
Beautiful, beautiful Zion.

04:12.428 --> 04:18.141
Glory to, glory to Zion.
The beautiful sea of love.

04:20.186 --> 04:24.606
- Zion is a beautiful resort, sir.
- Yeah. Heaven on Earth.

04:25.649 --> 04:29.028
- Yeah. Take it in while you can.
- What's that?

04:29.946 --> 04:33.323
Really, Gregory?
I had a fucking thing planned.

04:33.323 --> 04:36.243
- I'm sorry, Jess.
- What's happening right now?

04:36.243 --> 04:39.080
Well go on, Gregory. You wanna spill
the damn beans, speak outta turn.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.624
- Tell him. Do it, damn it.
- You're fired, Walker.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.587
- Take it like a man if you can.
- What are they talking about Jesse?

04:47.587 --> 04:50.550
I've driven your daddy for years.
And you know I would take a bullet.

04:50.550 --> 04:52.467
Well, I used to think that.

04:52.467 --> 04:56.513
Until I started seeing little tidbits
about my family being publish online.

04:56.513 --> 05:00.600
- Insights into the transition of power
- You got the wrong guy, Jesse.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.939
Behold, this was published
in Christian Times.

05:05.814 --> 05:08.817
"After the Gemstone heirs
got the disma poll numbers,

05:08.817 --> 05:12.363
Amber Gemstone made sugar cookies
to lighten the mood."

05:13.156 --> 05:15.657
Says an insider to the family.

05:15.657 --> 05:19.537
I ain't the only one you told
that story to Jesse. It's a nice story.

05:19.537 --> 05:24.167
Sugar cookies ain't real bitch. That's
a detail I made up to sniff out the rat

05:24.167 --> 05:26.042
She made crescents, son.

05:26.042 --> 05:29.421
You're the only one I told sugar
cooks to, you fucking snitch!

05:29.421 --> 05:31.090
- Grab his ass.
- What?

05:31.090 --> 05:37.138
- Come on, now. Oh, no!
- Keep an eye out Levi.

05:37.138 --> 05:39.639
- Get you some.
- Jess, come on, please.

05:40.223 --> 05:41.642
- Tally-ho.
- What?

05:43.019 --> 05:45.979
How you doing? We're just having
fun. We're just playing around.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.482
Dammit, Jesse. You brought me all
the way to Florida just to fire me?

05:49.482 --> 05:53.112
Yes I did. When your family
asks how you broke your nose

05:53.696 --> 05:56.072
tell them
it was a kite surfing accident.

05:56.740 --> 05:58.366
My nose ain't broken,

06:01.245 --> 06:04.457
Yeah, it is. Kite surfing
is a lot harder than it looks.

06:05.541 --> 06:07.792
How was your Judy On Top Tour?
Fun?

06:07.792 --> 06:11.672
You know, it's life on the road.
Port-to-port, city-to-city.

06:12.215 --> 06:14.007
Screaming fans.

06:17.345 --> 06:19.930
- Thank you.
- Hey, that was a cold fish kiss.

06:21.182 --> 06:23.142
- Everything okay, Jude?
- Yes.

06:23.142 --> 06:26.270
It's just I've been on a five state
tour, Beej. I'm tired!

06:26.813 --> 06:31.567
- Cut me some friggin'slack. Gosh.
- My famous wife.

06:32.234 --> 06:35.988
I always knew when I married you
I'd have to share you with the world.

06:35.988 --> 06:38.658
- Okay. I gotta go.
- What? Already?

06:38.658 --> 06:42.328
I have work duties, Beej. Me and
my brothers run the church now.

06:42.328 --> 06:44.205
I love you so much.

06:46.624 --> 06:49.376
I love you too.
So glad you're home!

06:50.586 --> 06:53.923
- Keefe, this is gonna hurt...
- No doubt.

06:55.007 --> 06:56.758
We wiped out most of their stock.

06:56.758 --> 07:00.054
That shop is gonna have
nothing else to sell like this.

07:00.054 --> 07:04.976
- Until they restock. And then what?
- We'll return and buy it all again.

07:05.768 --> 07:09.980
- Remember yourself, Taryn.
- No. No, she has a point.

07:09.980 --> 07:14.401
We're trying to shut these deviants
down, not give them an economic boost.

07:14.401 --> 07:18.113
But I'm still so impressed
by you, guys.

07:19.407 --> 07:23.785
This shows me how motivated you are
to achieve the Smut Busters' goals.

07:24.537 --> 07:27.999
No smut, no lust, no coconuts.

07:29.375 --> 07:34.714
Part of being in the group is
doing the saying when we do it.

07:35.089 --> 07:37.924
I did not know what was happening.

07:47.517 --> 07:50.896
Through the power of Christ's love
and lasik surgery

07:50.896 --> 07:55.359
we have restored sight
to the blind at least the nearsighted.

07:56.902 --> 08:00.656
These primitive people
can see Christ's world

08:00.656 --> 08:04.201
and read signs at night
much better because of us.

08:04.201 --> 08:07.830
I'm not sure how many of them read
street signs at night in the rainforest

08:07.830 --> 08:09.707
And that's not really
the main reason why we did it.

08:09.707 --> 08:12.376
- I didn't say it was the main reason.
- You are heavily featuring it. So...

08:12.376 --> 08:15.337
Time to wrap it up. They're
trying to get back to me singing.

08:15.337 --> 08:17.756
We're accompanying the montage,
Judy. You're not the main part.

08:17.756 --> 08:20.051
- Yeah. This isn't a solo tour, Judy.
- No, it's not.

08:20.051 --> 08:22.511
We're doing our thing right now...

08:22.511 --> 08:26.766
Revelation will set you free.

08:29.268 --> 08:34.356
Illumination soon you will see.

08:36.484 --> 08:40.738
Took care of your driver Walker. That
bitch is history, Daddy. Lying sneak.

08:41.113 --> 08:44.700
I'll be needing a new driver.
Somebody we can trust this time.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.787
We'll get you one. Hopefully
maybe Judy and Kelvin could help out,

08:48.787 --> 08:52.541
seeing as how I do every other
goddamn thing around here lately.

08:52.541 --> 08:55.710
Man, Jesse, shut the fuck up.
You're ain't the boss of us.

08:55.710 --> 08:59.006
- I'm the main decider.
- We're all deciders. Not just you.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.716
Please Kelvin!

09:00.716 --> 09:04.345
You and old slow eyes over there
are off doing your damn pervert protest

09:04.345 --> 09:06.180
to help with the church at all.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.098
The Smut Busters
have already taken down

09:08.098 --> 09:11.394
16 porno shops
on the I-95 corridor alone.

09:11.394 --> 09:15.690
I'm glad that the truck drivers won't
be able to buy dick pills. Bravo.

09:15.690 --> 09:19.610
The point is none of y'all but Jesse
are doing anything important.

09:19.610 --> 09:22.113
You know this has been
a really hard time for our family.

09:22.113 --> 09:25.407
Our son was injured,
almost killed in a work accident.

09:25.407 --> 09:26.784
Mom, please don't.

09:26.784 --> 09:29.287
This has been very traumatic
for us and y'all don't even care.

09:29.287 --> 09:31.622
Gideon, your mom is trying
to Munchausen you.

09:31.622 --> 09:35.709
Amber, stop trying to milk sympathy
votes for your son being a crippled.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.377
Jesse, get her ass in line.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.504
Maybe you need to stop
talking about Baron Munchausen.

09:39.504 --> 09:44.176
- Can we please just eat in peace?
- I have some not so peaceful news.

09:44.886 --> 09:47.513
As you all know, since
your Daddy he taken a step back,

09:47.513 --> 09:51.725
there has been a decline
in both attendance and donations.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.978
I have noticed that the seats high up
have been empty more and more.

09:54.978 --> 10:00.483
Now I've been informed that one of
our largest benefactors is departing.

10:01.569 --> 10:04.529
- Who?
- The race car driver, Dusty Daniels.

10:04.989 --> 10:08.910
Dusty Daniels? The Slick Bandit?
That guy is a living legend.

10:08.910 --> 10:11.871
He's like a hundred years old. He's
gonna be dead soon anyway, so oh well.

10:11.871 --> 10:15.500
Our ministry was to receive
his entire estate,

10:15.500 --> 10:19.045
including branding,
corporation, even his name.

10:19.462 --> 10:22.005
So what?
We got names. Don't need his.

10:22.005 --> 10:26.511
His name is currently estimated
to be worth over $200 million.

10:27.261 --> 10:29.347
Motherfucker!

10:29.347 --> 10:34.060
We were also set to inherit Dusty's
slogan, "Whoweee, Sucker!"

10:34.435 --> 10:37.229
Merchandising alone
over $30 million.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.649
Is this 'cause of the goddamn
shitty poll numbers?

10:39.649 --> 10:43.027
The ones where 85% said

10:43.027 --> 10:46.656
you're colder than a fucking ice cube
shoved up a polar bear's asshole?

10:46.656 --> 10:48.115
I remember those same polls saying

10:48.115 --> 10:51.494
that you're songs are when most
people in church to take a shit.

10:52.077 --> 10:54.037
- Prove it, Jesse!
- I will.

10:54.037 --> 10:56.790
Maybe if y'all stopped henpeckin'
at one another

10:56.790 --> 11:00.585
and started trying to fix what ain't
work you wouldn't be in this situation.

11:00.585 --> 11:03.881
Y'all need to go connect with him,
win his confidence.

11:03.881 --> 11:06.467
Dusty is not happy,
I don't blame him.

11:07.426 --> 11:10.638
I will try to go administer to him.
We'll see if these guys will help.

11:10.638 --> 11:11.806
I'll do it Daddy.

11:16.601 --> 11:17.894
Grow up!

11:35.163 --> 11:37.748
Man, real talk y'all,
I don't get this race car shit.

11:37.748 --> 11:41.043
Bunch of rednecks racing around to see
who can go nowhere the fastest.

11:41.043 --> 11:43.671
Well, now's not the time
to be PMS'ing, Judy.

11:44.297 --> 11:48.258
She's been a real B-l-T-C-H
since she got back from tour.

11:48.258 --> 11:52.346
Why's everybody wondering 'bout my
tour? Asking me what happened.

11:52.346 --> 11:55.849
I sang fuckin' songs.
That's it. End of story.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.018
- Somebody's been acting mysterious.
- Fuck off.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.438
- What happened on tour?
- Fuck off, nothing.

12:00.438 --> 12:02.773
By the way I'm on my period.
Not PMS-ing.

12:02.773 --> 12:05.902
Guys here he comes. Big smiles.
Cheers. Big cheers!

12:06.401 --> 12:08.320
- Yes.
- Yes.

12:15.703 --> 12:20.040
Whoweee, Sucker! The Slick
Bandit, looking slicker than ever.

12:20.040 --> 12:24.127
- God's fastest son on four wheels.
- Someone's fixin' for a comeback?

12:24.127 --> 12:26.713
Waste of your time coming up here.

12:26.713 --> 12:30.133
Ain't nothing the three of you
can say gonna change my mind.

12:31.009 --> 12:34.889
Let me shoot you straight.
Your church has changed.

12:36.097 --> 12:38.808
When Eli was headin' things up
I was happy.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.271
But now that he ain't,
I don't like it so much.

12:42.271 --> 12:46.692
We are gonna make this right.
We're young and up to the task dude.

12:47.025 --> 12:50.238
That's the thing. I don't
trust young people. I'm old school.

12:50.238 --> 12:54.115
We are not as young as you think
we are. I mean, Kelvin does Botox.

12:55.743 --> 12:58.495
- I don't do Botox. Never done.
- You do. You do too, do Botox.

12:58.830 --> 13:01.915
There's an indention where sunglasses
smushed your Botox'd forehead.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.875
- There isn't one.
- Right here.

13:03.875 --> 13:08.797
Dusty, Jesse's got more grays than you
do man, dude is rockin' a bad dye job.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.342
He didn't used to look
like a deformed Dracula.

13:12.342 --> 13:14.427
- I do not look like a deformed Dracula
- Yeah, you do.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.556
I don't dye my hair! I just changed
my shampoo is all you idiots!

13:17.556 --> 13:20.059
See. Right there.

13:22.352 --> 13:26.273
When I used to watch your Momma and
Daddy, I felt the love. It was nice.

13:27.108 --> 13:29.901
I don't feel the love
in this current configuration.

13:29.901 --> 13:32.654
So I'm pulling up my stakes
and I making a change.

13:32.654 --> 13:36.909
We love each other, we do. We're
in love with each other. We always do.

13:36.909 --> 13:38.578
All the juice here.

13:40.663 --> 13:43.331
- Whoooweee, sucker!
- Oh, there you go.

13:56.095 --> 13:59.764
Jesus in Jerusalem.
The fucking Simkins.

14:15.072 --> 14:16.282
Good to see you.

14:16.282 --> 14:19.118
Dusty, tell me you have not signed
with these snake oil salesmen?

14:19.118 --> 14:23.496
Take it easy, Jesse. We don't want
no ill will with the Gemstones.

14:23.914 --> 14:27.835
- Dusty and our family go way back.
- I worship with them now.

14:27.835 --> 14:31.213
They're "Pull yourself up by your
bootstraps" type folks. I like that.

14:31.213 --> 14:32.965
Nobody handed it to 'em.

14:32.965 --> 14:35.134
After Mom and Dad died
in the plane crash.

14:35.134 --> 14:38.094
- Here we go.
- I had to raise my siblings.

14:38.930 --> 14:40.932
I could've returned Craig
to the orphanage,

14:40.932 --> 14:42.975
but I knew my parents
wouldn't have wanted that.

14:42.975 --> 14:47.229
So we banded together.
To finish what they so humbly started.

14:47.604 --> 14:51.149
Look where we are today.
Helping millions around the world.

14:51.149 --> 14:54.361
- And getting bigger every day.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:54.361 --> 14:58.991
- Hey Dusty, you are looking good.
- I appreciate that, Shay.

14:59.534 --> 15:01.952
You ain't looking so bad yourself.

15:02.537 --> 15:06.833
Hey Dusty, sup boy.
I also think you're a hot man.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.376
Not just Shay,
she's not the only one here.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.546
How am I looking to you right now?
Pretty good too?

15:11.546 --> 15:16.258
You look good. All y'all look good.
But it ain't all about the looks.

15:16.258 --> 15:19.971
That's a really good thing, because
if it were, we'd win by a mile.

15:19.971 --> 15:21.763
- Am I right?
- You're right.

15:21.763 --> 15:24.599
- Our bodies.
- No one looking as fine as me.

15:25.267 --> 15:27.061
You're gorgeous, Craig.

15:27.061 --> 15:30.480
Dusty, You've worshipped with
our family for 35 plus years.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.733
- You gotta give us another shot.
- I'll tell you what?

15:33.733 --> 15:36.862
Y'all want me to be a member
of your church so bad,

15:38.154 --> 15:40.031
why don't you battle for me.

15:40.031 --> 15:44.327
Like a foot race? Or see who
can hold their breath the longest?

15:44.327 --> 15:49.666
- Like an egg toss?
- Nah. Let's settle it in one of those.

15:54.672 --> 15:58.008
- I don't really know stock cars...
- Chicken, Simkins?

16:00.636 --> 16:02.346
What are they doing?

16:02.346 --> 16:06.850
Dusty, we feel the Lord has led you
to where you're supposed to be,

16:06.850 --> 16:10.770
worshipping with us:
I'll drive on behalf of my family.

16:13.231 --> 16:16.319
- What are you doing?
- Trying to hold y'all hands.

16:16.319 --> 16:18.612
Just let it happen fuckers.

16:19.237 --> 16:24.201
Dusty we as well believe

16:24.201 --> 16:27.622
that the Lord wants
to have you on our side too.

16:27.622 --> 16:31.709
So, on behalf of my family,
I will drive too.

16:32.084 --> 16:34.795
- So, awkward.
- So, there it is.

16:45.473 --> 16:47.641
Okay, Homie.
You sure you got this?

16:47.641 --> 16:50.853
My car at home is fast as fuck.
How can this be any different?

16:50.853 --> 16:54.189
Besides, you heard him,
he said he's got zero experience.

16:54.189 --> 16:58.860
I said no experience in stock cars.
I've dabbled in Formula One.

17:01.155 --> 17:04.741
- That son of a bitch.
- That means he's gonna F it up.

17:08.620 --> 17:10.248
Let's race!

17:36.273 --> 17:37.941
Goddamn it!

17:37.941 --> 17:41.736
- Do the gas! Do the gas!
- My car is broken.

17:42.196 --> 17:44.114
Go you fucking race car go!

17:59.880 --> 18:02.299
- Fuck!
- What happened, Jesse?

18:02.299 --> 18:05.427
- This is embarrassing, dude.
- Whooweee sucker!

18:11.141 --> 18:14.978
Now that I'm semi-retired,
this change has given me time

18:14.978 --> 18:18.566
to reflect on my life and
my journey with Christ.

18:18.566 --> 18:21.944
And I've put these reflections down
into written word.

18:22.445 --> 18:27.617
My definith autobiography.
Why definitive you ask?

18:28.074 --> 18:31.537
Well, because it's about
the third one I've written.

18:32.330 --> 18:36.708
I guess I lived longer than I thought,
and I still have a little more to say.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.172
Thank you.

18:45.676 --> 18:49.055
Oh, thank you very much for coming.
I knew I recognized you.

18:49.055 --> 18:52.057
- God bless you, and have a great day.
- Thank you. Bless you.

18:58.563 --> 19:01.567
- You got a lot of nerve coming here.
- Well, I paid the signing fee.

19:01.567 --> 19:04.069
Figures you have to pay money
to get a little face time.

19:04.069 --> 19:06.447
We've got a restraining order
against you. Security!

19:06.447 --> 19:08.698
- I need your help, Eli.
- I don't care what you need.

19:08.698 --> 19:10.910
Aimee-Leigh would hear me out.
You know she would.

19:10.910 --> 19:14.038
How dare you say her name!
Get her out of here! No.

19:14.038 --> 19:17.332
- I need your help! It's my boys, Eli!
- Get out!

19:17.332 --> 19:20.378
I wouldn't have come to you otherwise.
Let go of me. I'm going!

19:22.796 --> 19:26.383
39 Christian marriage counselors
were brought on as consultants

19:26.383 --> 19:29.720
to ensure
that the system was effective.

19:29.720 --> 19:34.266
A program you can use at home to help
your marriage better honor Jesus Christ

19:34.766 --> 19:38.478
For just $500 you get
The System starter kit,

19:38.478 --> 19:41.314
which has everything you need
to begin your journey

19:41.314 --> 19:44.734
to a happy and healthy marriage
in the eyes of the Lord.

19:44.734 --> 19:48.156
Is your marriage important to you?
Then what are you waiting for?

19:48.531 --> 19:50.032
Call now!

19:50.699 --> 19:53.452
- Well, did y'all get Dusty back?
- Nope.

19:53.785 --> 19:56.247
Lost him to the fucking Simkins
of all people.

19:56.247 --> 19:58.790
The siblings whose parents
died in a plane crash?

19:58.790 --> 20:01.835
Yes. They're so fucking lucky.

20:01.835 --> 20:06.298
I wish I had some traumatic event that
I can exploit to make people like us.

20:06.924 --> 20:09.718
Our origin story sucks
compared to theirs.

20:09.718 --> 20:13.930
Ain't nobody's rooting for born
wealthy people to become more wealthy.

20:13.930 --> 20:18.268
- I'm really worried. Are you?
- No. A little concerned.

20:18.268 --> 20:21.522
I wish that Judy and Kelvin's mouths
were taped shut

20:21.522 --> 20:23.441
and that you were the only one
in charge.

20:23.441 --> 20:26.277
Baby, their energy
makes y'all look desperate.

20:26.277 --> 20:30.363
That's because we are desperate. We're
picking up where Eli Gemstoni left off.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.868
A man who's done this job for
a fucking hundred thousands of years

20:33.868 --> 20:35.827
and America's Jesus Daddy.

20:35.827 --> 20:37.788
I'm not trying to rain on your parade.

20:37.788 --> 20:41.750
I'm glad you have your counseling,
thing-a-ma-bob, or whatever this is.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.961
- The System?
- Sure. Whatever.

20:43.961 --> 20:45.962
It's taking up a lot of your time.

20:45.962 --> 20:49.509
And this is a moment where I could
really use all hands on deck at home.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.218
What's not getting done at home?

20:51.218 --> 20:56.097
Our son, Pontius, has tattooed
another word on his fucking face?

20:56.097 --> 20:57.809
Blessed. I know.

20:57.809 --> 21:02.188
It seems you're giving a lot of attention
to other people's relationships

21:02.188 --> 21:05.316
and if you focused more on your own,

21:05.316 --> 21:09.320
we wouldn't have children putting
fucking calligraphy on their faces.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.531
Look, baby, I know that you're upset.
But please don't take it out on me.

21:13.365 --> 21:16.243
A small decline was to be expected
for this kind of transition.

21:16.243 --> 21:18.955
You know what it's like when it's like
when Jay Leno took over for Carson.

21:18.955 --> 21:20.706
It was a rocky there for a bit.

21:20.706 --> 21:23.835
But what happened in the end?
Leno shot to the top.

21:24.793 --> 21:28.631
What if we're not Leno,
what if we're just Conan?

21:30.840 --> 21:32.176
Fuck me.

21:33.010 --> 21:36.471
This ministry helped me unlock
the best version of myself.

21:36.471 --> 21:40.183
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm married into the family.

21:40.183 --> 21:43.646
Who knows what Gemstone
Salvation Center can do for you?

21:43.646 --> 21:46.774
Now, Janice and Tall
have enrollment packages.

21:46.774 --> 21:50.277
Scan the QR code for easy
step-by-step instructions

21:50.277 --> 21:54.781
on how to have tithing automatically
deducted from your account each month.

21:54.781 --> 21:58.118
It's never been easier
to share your praise.

22:05.458 --> 22:09.045
I am crushing my Welcome Center
duties. They were feelin' me today.

22:09.045 --> 22:11.591
And you're really working it.
That's for sure.

22:11.591 --> 22:14.634
- Here. I got you some gifts.
- Gifts? Why?

22:15.428 --> 22:19.014
I thought about what a good husband
you are and how much I love you.

22:19.014 --> 22:20.975
- Go ahead, take a look!
- Okay.

22:21.558 --> 22:26.563
An infrared meat thermometer,
a Theragun, a VR Headset?

22:27.355 --> 22:29.191
I've been wanting one of these.

22:29.191 --> 22:30.860
Now I can fully immerse myself
in the nature

22:30.860 --> 22:33.279
and space games
that I gravitate toward.

22:33.862 --> 22:37.325
These are really thoughtful, Judy.
But this isn't necessary.

22:37.700 --> 22:41.329
God dang, why you gotta kick
my gift horse in the nuts right now?

22:41.661 --> 22:43.372
Is everything okay?

22:43.372 --> 22:47.001
It feels like things have been a little
off since you got back from tour.

22:47.001 --> 22:51.005
Oh, my God. What?
No! Everything's great.

22:51.005 --> 22:53.632
Why are you reading stuff into things?
Everything is awesome.

22:54.091 --> 22:56.636
I just love you and
I wanted to give you presents.

22:56.636 --> 23:01.682
- Don't emotionally disappoint me.
- Love you too. Thank you for the gifts

23:06.854 --> 23:10.398
Just like any family,
we've had our ups and downs.

23:10.398 --> 23:14.027
And it's no secret
we've faced some controversy.

23:14.862 --> 23:20.033
In the early 2000s, we found ourselves
in a war with the press and detractors.

23:21.535 --> 23:25.163
My wife would stay awake concerned
with how people saw her.

23:28.251 --> 23:30.961
But they were getting
the wrong message.

23:31.379 --> 23:33.214
I assured her...

23:36.925 --> 23:40.637
- Mind if we take little break?
- Yes, sir. We can take a small break.

23:54.068 --> 23:56.404
Goddamn. What the hell
are y'all cooking out here?

23:56.404 --> 23:58.990
- Devil's objects.
- Devil's objects?

23:58.990 --> 24:01.617
I don't think you're supposed to bur
this stuff. That shit' poisonous.

24:01.617 --> 24:03.493
I don't feel very well.

24:03.493 --> 24:07.706
The smoke was green from the butt
plugs, and smelled like pool toys.

24:07.706 --> 24:11.918
Keefe, how bout we take a break from
the burn pit? Give us a moment?

24:14.462 --> 24:16.798
What you doing here, Jesse?
Still trying to fight?

24:16.798 --> 24:19.759
Talking about how you're
the only one doing things, hmm?

24:19.759 --> 24:23.597
No, actually that's not what
I'm here to do. I came to apologize.

24:24.890 --> 24:28.144
I'm sorry I made fun of your Botox'd
indented forehead in front of Dusty.

24:28.144 --> 24:30.813
That's not how co-church leaders
should act.

24:30.813 --> 24:36.319
I don't have a dented Botox forehead.
I was just holding my face funny.

24:36.777 --> 24:39.405
- Well, you know, even if you do.
- Well, I don't.

24:39.405 --> 24:41.865
But if you do dye your sideburns,

24:41.865 --> 24:43.950
I'm sorry I said that you look
like a deformed Dracula.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.537
Well I don't dye my sideburns.
But I accept your apology.

24:48.663 --> 24:50.124
- Good.
- Great.

24:50.124 --> 24:53.753
- I have a Botox forehead, so...
- I don't dye my sideburns.

24:56.213 --> 24:59.633
I'm scared, Jesse.
What if we don't have what it takes?

25:00.802 --> 25:02.469
I'm scared too.

25:02.469 --> 25:05.013
The only one way through this,
I guess is

25:05.013 --> 25:08.309
if we just have to rise the occasion.
Refuse to fail.

25:09.017 --> 25:11.603
- How we gonna do that?
- Together.

25:14.774 --> 25:17.735
- Do we have to include Judy?
- Even that bitch.

25:28.079 --> 25:32.165
The diva is back, y'all.
Hey, everybody! What's up?

25:33.042 --> 25:35.211
Stephen, I'm glad you're here.
Would you be up

25:35.211 --> 25:38.089
for going through some guitar solos
on Angels Lift Me Higher?

25:38.089 --> 25:40.257
- Sure.
- Hey, everybody, listen up!

25:41.384 --> 25:44.427
Stephen and I need to work
on some important creative stuff

25:44.427 --> 25:47.264
with guitar solo stuff
for one of the songs.

25:47.264 --> 25:50.268
So, if everybody could leave us alone?
That'd be great.

25:50.268 --> 25:55.605
Y'all get it. Artistry. Get a little
rest or get you a coke or whatever.

25:55.939 --> 25:58.651
See yo soon Tamothy,
you did a great job on tour.

26:02.654 --> 26:05.116
Oh, fuck, I missed this.

26:06.825 --> 26:09.953
Being bad like some bitch
in an '80s movie.

26:09.953 --> 26:13.166
So glad I had to come in and unload
the last of that tour gear.

26:13.166 --> 26:16.501
- I had to see you.
- Well you saw me enough.

26:18.837 --> 26:23.134
And now, it's time to nut up.
Because road head is road head.

26:23.758 --> 26:27.805
That's just the rules of the tour.
We can't be bringing this shit home.

26:27.805 --> 26:31.267
We helped each other through
a very trying time in our lives,

26:31.267 --> 26:35.855
by dry humping twice and kissing
three times, now that's four.

26:35.855 --> 26:39.859
But we can't take this any further
or we could cause some real damage.

26:40.984 --> 26:45.281
So this, this is goodbye, Stephen.

26:45.947 --> 26:50.703
- You'll have suffer through the pain.
- Very well, Judy Gemstone.

27:02.339 --> 27:04.050
Quit it, Stephen.

27:09.971 --> 27:14.100
I said quit it.
You understand me?

27:20.148 --> 27:22.568
What the fuck is this?!

27:22.568 --> 27:26.029
That's how that part of the song goes.
It goes like up and then down.

27:26.489 --> 27:30.033
- I should go practice.
- You keep your fucking ass right here.

27:30.033 --> 27:34.080
- You're cheating, Judy? Gross!
- No, Kelvin, this ain't what you think

27:34.080 --> 27:36.666
Oh, it's not? Do you know
this young lady is married?

27:36.666 --> 27:42.421
- Yeah. I am too.
- Y'all are a bunch of dirtbags.

27:42.421 --> 27:47.051
Kelvin, you fucking dork! We're
rehearsing a song. This is not a deal.

27:47.051 --> 27:49.344
- Great rehearsal, Stephen.
- Very good working with you.

27:49.344 --> 27:51.472
Thank you for rehearsing.
Au Chante.

27:51.472 --> 27:53.641
Au Chante, motherfucker,
you can go right now.

27:53.641 --> 27:56.560
You come back around here again,
I'll send your ass straight to hell.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.272
- I work here though.
- Not anymore, you don't, bro.

27:59.272 --> 28:02.274
- He works for me.
- As main decider, he is fired.

28:02.274 --> 28:07.070
- Well, he's rehired.
- I'm re-firing him for infinity.

28:07.070 --> 28:09.406
- Bye-bye, bitch!
- You have to. Two outvotes one.

28:09.406 --> 28:11.241
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Be gone Stephen!

28:11.241 --> 28:13.743
Sugar Ray looking motherfucker.
Get the fuck out of here.

28:13.743 --> 28:16.247
- Get out of here. Come on.
- You get out!

28:16.247 --> 28:19.417
Don't stomp him, Jesse.
Fuck, he's leaving.

28:20.710 --> 28:24.881
What the fuck, Judy? You think we can
handle this scandalous bullshit now?

28:24.881 --> 28:29.594
Oh, fuck off, Jesse. Like you ain't
done your fair share of illicit shit.

28:29.594 --> 28:34.557
I was on tour y'al. This is
the shit that happens on the road.

28:34.557 --> 28:37.935
- What the fuck are y'all even here for?
- We came here to do something nice.

28:38.518 --> 28:41.730
To have a fucking sibling bonding
pep talk about the future.

28:41.730 --> 28:47.360
- Instead I come here to see this...
- Fine, let's fucking pep it up, bros.

28:47.986 --> 28:51.991
Come on, sibling bonding. Put
your hands in. New generation on three.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.659
I'm saying how we do hands.
We're holding hands.

28:54.659 --> 28:58.371
Give me your fucking hands.
Go on. Hold her fucking hands.

29:00.457 --> 29:04.419
To the new generation, united, some...

29:05.629 --> 29:08.840
Okay, Jesse, this is not natural.
We do not hold hands.

29:08.840 --> 29:12.011
Well, the Simkins hold hands.
It seems fucking natural.

29:12.011 --> 29:15.263
We ain't a holding hands family.
Okay, dude? We never have been.

29:15.263 --> 29:17.682
We do hands on hands, okay?
We're not the freaking Simkins.

29:18.725 --> 29:21.269
You can sure as shit say that again.

29:25.941 --> 29:28.318
Y'all don't tell on me.

30:29.296 --> 30:32.842
- Been a while since you've been here.
- Oh, damn. Yes, it has.

30:33.926 --> 30:39.056
I'm surprised you want anything to do
with this place after the bad memories.

30:40.433 --> 30:42.601
It's all I got left.

30:43.561 --> 30:46.563
- You know, after Peter went away...
- I'm not here to talk about Peter.

30:46.563 --> 30:49.900
After he went away,
the bank took the house.

30:50.775 --> 30:56.239
The boys turned mean. Bitter.
They scare me, Eli.

30:57.325 --> 31:00.036
I know you haven't spoken
to the family in many years.

31:00.036 --> 31:02.746
- I had good reason for that.
- I had good reason to do what I done.

31:02.746 --> 31:06.124
- Oh, here we go.
- Look at you, Mr. Hotshot Preacher.

31:06.124 --> 31:10.295
You got more piss and vinegar than
you did when you was begging for help.

31:13.841 --> 31:15.800
What's this about?

31:17.052 --> 31:21.431
Peter got out. My boys
left me and followed him.

31:21.431 --> 31:25.728
I think they're in trouble. I don't
know if they're selling guns, or drugs.

31:25.728 --> 31:29.773
- Do you expect me to do something?
- I'd die without my boys.

31:31.025 --> 31:33.735
I got no one else. Please, Eli.

31:35.028 --> 31:37.990
After all this time,
why should I help you?

31:40.326 --> 31:42.827
Because you're my big brother, Eli.

31:49.502 --> 31:52.754
Please help us win, God.
Please help everyone accept us.

31:52.754 --> 31:56.675
And for us to be triumphant over
those that would seek to destroy us.

32:27.372 --> 32:29.791
Do we have confirmed visual?

32:33.461 --> 32:34.922
Visual confirmed.

32:35.255 --> 32:38.050
Take the motherfucker to church.

33:02.700 --> 33:05.493
- You drove right into me!
- You fucked up my bumper.

33:05.493 --> 33:09.623
Don't even try. You were at fault here.
Let's see your insurance.

33:10.165 --> 33:11.750
It's behind you.

33:13.753 --> 33:17.964
Shut it down! Shut it down!
Shut it down! Shut it down!

33:31.687 --> 33:32.980
Take him in the car.

33:32.980 --> 33:35.732
Shut it down! Shut it down!

33:39.361 --> 33:40.904
Get out of here.

33:41.531 --> 33:43.157
Shut it down!
