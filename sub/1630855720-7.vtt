WEBVTT

01:18.787 --> 01:22.040
<i>In America, we rewrite history</i>

01:23.876 --> 01:25.043
<i>by erasing it.</i>

01:34.344 --> 01:37.306
What are you doing? Stop!
Crazy fucking bitch!

01:37.306 --> 01:38.724
Okay, you need locking up!

01:39.725 --> 01:41.268
What are you doing?

01:42.144 --> 01:43.979
You need to be fucking locked up!

01:43.979 --> 01:46.023
Let go of me! Please.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.108
There you go, honey.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.027
<i>"This is Apollo. Leave a message."</i>

01:50.027 --> 01:52.070
I've been calling you for three days.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.283
I don't know where you are, Apollo.
I don't know where you are.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.172
<i>People wash up in New York. Literally.</i>

02:12.049 --> 02:15.469
<i>The Elk Hotel has been
in business for over 100 years.</i>

02:16.678 --> 02:19.681
<i>Built to serve immigrants
passing through Ellis Island.</i>

02:21.183 --> 02:25.521
I'm here to unmake a deal.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.653
<i>One hundred years is quite
the American success story...</i>

02:34.029 --> 02:37.449
<i>considering this is the shittiest hotel
in the world.</i>

02:37.449 --> 02:39.201
<i>...Mozart symphony has been discovered.</i>

02:39.201 --> 02:42.538
<i>The Bavarian State Library,
where it was found,</i>

02:42.538 --> 02:46.834
<i>said the complete symphony was put
in manuscript form by Mozart's father</i>

02:46.834 --> 02:49.211
<i>to save the cost of a note copier.</i>

02:50.420 --> 02:54.258
<i>The newly discovered symphony
will be performed in public May 17th</i>

02:54.258 --> 02:58.011
- <i>at a concert in Bavaria.</i>
- He got you good.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.598
<i>External investigators
are still trying to verify</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:03.684
<i>the authenticity of the document.</i>

03:03.684 --> 03:05.644
<i>However, a spokesperson for the library...</i>

03:05.644 --> 03:07.062
I remember this.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.230
How long?

03:08.814 --> 03:10.440
All of this.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.985
- How long?
- I want Room 205.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.486
No. Look at the rates.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.199
The whole night.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.660
- All night?
- <i>Lester was weary.</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:24.246
<i>For 20 years he'd worked this desk.</i>

03:25.247 --> 03:29.126
<i>His job was to differentiate
between gang member and murderer,</i>

03:29.126 --> 03:32.880
<i>versus whore, drug dealer, john, or pimp.</i>

03:32.880 --> 03:36.341
<i>He'd watched gangs wage war
outside this very door.</i>

03:36.925 --> 03:40.929
<i>Teenagers-- Nay, babies,
senselessly killed on the sidewalk.</i>

03:40.929 --> 03:41.847
How long?

03:41.847 --> 03:44.808
<i>At first, he'd gone out there
and scrubbed at the cement.</i>

03:45.684 --> 03:47.227
<i>Now it was rust-red.</i>

03:48.729 --> 03:49.730
Seventy-five.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.108
<i>Gang members
and murderers were denied a room.</i>

03:53.901 --> 03:55.694
You get your receipt when you check out.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.154
<i>Everyone else was welcome.</i>

03:58.947 --> 04:01.867
<i>Of course, his deciphering skills
weren't always up to par.</i>

04:03.202 --> 04:05.204
<i>Like the time a trans woman was strangled,</i>

04:05.704 --> 04:08.457
<i>stuffed under the bed
in a gold sequined dress,</i>

04:08.457 --> 04:11.210
<i>and left undiscovered for two weeks.</i>

04:12.336 --> 04:14.379
- How many of you?
- Just me.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.589
You alone, huh?

04:16.298 --> 04:19.259
<i>No one to claim her, buried unnamed.</i>

04:20.052 --> 04:21.386
Alone.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.890
There are centuries of names in that book.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.318
Storm coming.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.781
Yes, there is.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.256
Excuse me. You move for a lady.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.468
<i>We cast our dreams as a play.</i>

05:02.469 --> 05:07.015
<i>Who fills each role so we may bring
the unconscious to consciousness?</i>

05:17.234 --> 05:18.819
Who plays each role?

05:19.570 --> 05:20.571
<i>And why?</i>

05:22.656 --> 05:26.743
Hey! Don't touch. It's contagious.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.601
<i>Lillian didn't need Apollo's forgiveness.</i>

05:51.268 --> 05:52.561
<i>She needed her own.</i>

05:55.230 --> 05:57.149
<i>And it laid behind this very door.</i>

06:07.242 --> 06:10.037
<i>1981 was a bloody year in New York.</i>

06:17.419 --> 06:20.047
<i>Even Lillian could not escape
the violence.</i>

06:28.472 --> 06:30.307
<i>She had seen something that day.</i>

06:30.307 --> 06:31.225
No, Daddy!

06:31.225 --> 06:32.935
<i>Something she could never unsee.</i>

06:32.935 --> 06:35.354
Daddy! No!

06:43.946 --> 06:45.989
<i>And it had changed her once more.</i>

06:48.158 --> 06:53.080
<i>I know what you did, Lillian. I know.</i>

06:54.122 --> 06:55.832
So, you're really just gonna make me wait, huh?

06:57.376 --> 07:00.712
Yeah.
You really make me crazy, you know that?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.882
Yeah, sweetie. Yeah.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.970
See you later.

07:10.597 --> 07:15.394
<i>She had been here before.
That night. That long ago, terrible night.</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:19.773
<i>This room that held a secret
she swore she'd never tell.</i>

07:24.111 --> 07:28.907
<i>But secrets want out,
and prices will be paid.</i>

07:35.664 --> 07:37.457
That was your father's box.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.626
Someone left it at the door.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.607
So, tell me something else.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.317
What should I tell you?

08:03.317 --> 08:05.652
Well, you can't know
anything until you know everything.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.654
So, everything it is.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.493
<i>It was unimaginable
what had become of her.</i>

08:37.267 --> 08:38.268
What now, Lillian?

08:38.769 --> 08:41.063
<i>What now, Lillian? What then?</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:44.816
<i>Tell me your story,
and I will tell you who you are.</i>

08:53.116 --> 08:55.536
<i>It wouldn't be the last time
she'd hold a dying man.</i>

08:56.203 --> 09:00.123
<i>If you're a stickler for numbers,
then this would be the first of three.</i>

09:01.416 --> 09:03.669
<i>It is a tremor leading to the quake.</i>

09:04.253 --> 09:06.505
<i>One person moves away, breaks free,</i>

09:07.047 --> 09:10.676
<i>creates a seismic shift in a family
and in the land.</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:14.304
<i>But what is the cost of freedom?</i>

09:14.888 --> 09:18.976
<i>Had she been responsible for
all that happened after she fled Uganda?</i>

09:20.143 --> 09:21.895
<i>Could she have changed the course</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:24.648
<i>of her family's history had she stayed?</i>

09:26.316 --> 09:27.693
<i>But she had left.</i>

09:28.402 --> 09:31.738
<i>And after, The Butcher had seized power
from Obote</i>

09:31.738 --> 09:34.449
<i>and delivered a massacre to her people.</i>

09:34.449 --> 09:38.662
- <i>...they have to die</i>.
- <i>All were gone now. All gone.</i>

09:39.538 --> 09:41.748
<i>What god would make people suffer so?</i>

09:42.249 --> 09:45.711
<i>What god would bring her all this way
to smite her now?</i>

09:53.552 --> 09:54.970
No god of mine.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.602
Arthur.

10:50.526 --> 10:53.153
<i>Lillian had known for a long time</i>

10:53.153 --> 10:56.782
<i>that there were realer things
than the King of Kings right here.</i>

11:16.969 --> 11:18.762
<i>She remembered the hope.</i>

11:18.762 --> 11:22.724
<i>The unbridled hope that everything
could be different in America.</i>

11:23.433 --> 11:27.271
<i>New York had opened a crack in her,
and the light had crept back in.</i>

11:27.271 --> 11:29.064
<i>She found room to dream.</i>

11:29.940 --> 11:33.110
<i>Her grandmother had always said
she had a lovely voice.</i>

11:33.610 --> 11:36.655
<i>Maybe she could be a lounge singer
in a sparkling dress,</i>

11:36.655 --> 11:39.199
<i>belting out torch songs
in some dusty saloon.</i>

11:39.199 --> 11:45.122
<i>Maybe she would meet someone,
fall in love, have a bunch of kids.</i>

11:45.747 --> 11:49.251
<i>America the Great. The promised land.</i>

11:50.377 --> 11:54.173
Apollo, I loved the place.
I believed in it.

11:55.174 --> 11:59.261
I could see what America wanted to be,
and I would kill to be American.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.182
<i>But sometimes, most times,</i>

12:03.974 --> 12:06.727
<i>it made me feel
a little bit like I had to get smaller.</i>

12:07.519 --> 12:12.441
Watch my words and my smiles.
Can't get too big, can't be angry.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.359
Don't you see?

12:15.027 --> 12:16.028
Can't be visible.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.030
That's not our baby!

12:18.030 --> 12:23.327
Apollo, have you heard me say
"I love you" enough times?

12:24.828 --> 12:28.248
I've made some mistakes in this world.
You are not one of them.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.503
<i>But I layered onto you,
even at your young age,</i>

12:32.503 --> 12:36.215
<i>my own... dis-ease.</i>

12:37.007 --> 12:38.133
<i>Unease.</i>

12:39.384 --> 12:40.385
<i>Fear.</i>

12:44.723 --> 12:47.893
Don't get big. Don't speak loud.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.939
Don't tell a joke.
Don't be too serious either.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.024
Don't draw attention to yourself.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.027
Don't throw a tantrum in the store.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.696
Just don't do that.

13:02.366 --> 13:07.955
Apollo, at four years old you already knew
what it felt like to live life afraid.

13:09.915 --> 13:13.752
When I was four,
my favorite thing in the whole wide world

13:14.545 --> 13:21.093
was finding my <i>jajja</i> outside, hunched
over a big iron pot, turning mandazis.

13:23.470 --> 13:28.892
You never tasted those.
Soft, fluffy doughnut clouds.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.395
Hot and spiced
with a little bit of cardamom,

13:31.395 --> 13:33.981
a little bit of cinnamon
and a lot of coconut milk.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.902
<i>Can't make a mandazi
without getting an oil burn.</i>

13:39.653 --> 13:42.322
<i>To make it taste perfect in the mouth,</i>

13:42.322 --> 13:47.160
<i>you must add
the too, too, too important ingredient.</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:49.246
- Love.
- <i>Love.</i>

13:50.873 --> 13:55.085
She was an oracle. Had a life lesson
for every minute of the day.

13:56.170 --> 14:01.800
<i>Lillian, the important thing in
life is what we do for the ones we love.</i>

14:02.968 --> 14:08.557
<i>Lillian, don't let a man make you crazy,
'cause he will try.</i>

14:20.319 --> 14:26.033
<i>Lillian,
if you decide to eat a dog, eat a fat one.</i>

14:35.709 --> 14:39.630
<i>If we're lucky,
each of us has the memory of a kitchen.</i>

14:40.214 --> 14:44.843
<i>The warmth and aroma
of something being cooked with love.</i>

14:46.970 --> 14:49.306
<i>Regardless of who we are,
where we're from,</i>

14:49.806 --> 14:54.645
<i>kitchen stove or iron pot,
we are all gifted this heirloom.</i>

14:55.812 --> 14:56.813
<i>If we're lucky.</i>

15:14.081 --> 15:15.958
The pot is all that's left.

15:18.544 --> 15:20.546
There you go, honey.

15:22.589 --> 15:26.844
<i>Lillian, ask help from the spirits</i>

15:26.844 --> 15:29.555
<i>when you have used all your strength.</i>

15:30.931 --> 15:35.644
Apollo, I never made you mandazis. Why?

15:36.311 --> 15:39.523
Because I wanted you
to like regular American kid food.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.860
I wanted you to fit in
with your mac and cheese diet

15:42.860 --> 15:45.696
and your hot dogs
and your white bread PBJs.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.115
But I made them with love.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.373
<i>I know what you did--</i>

15:57.916 --> 15:59.042
Storm is coming.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.088
Leak! Bucket!

16:05.257 --> 16:08.719
It's pissing through the ceiling,
Lester. I got a fucking guest, man.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.679
Is that what we're calling them now?

16:10.679 --> 16:14.266
You'll have to wait your turn, Angelica.
I'll get there when I get there.

16:14.266 --> 16:17.686
Just like you, Lester.
You'll get there when you get there.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.022
Take your snail-ass fucking time.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.565
<i>Si tu savais, cher.</i>

16:21.565 --> 16:24.568
I know what those words mean, asshole.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.327
- I want children.
- Excuse me?

16:33.327 --> 16:35.704
I want the chance to be
a good husband and a great father.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.332
I think I could do that. You know?

16:43.629 --> 16:44.922
There you go, honey.

16:47.508 --> 16:50.511
<i>Used to be advice passed
from woman to woman,</i>

16:51.178 --> 16:56.058
<i>drawn from the well of her knowledge,
how we do this hard, hard thing.</i>

16:56.558 --> 16:58.227
<i>I reach back to my mother</i>

16:58.227 --> 17:00.020
<i>and she holds my hand,</i>

17:00.020 --> 17:02.898
<i>and she reaches back
to her mother before that.</i>

17:02.898 --> 17:06.818
<i>A human chain of information
back and back and back.</i>

17:06.818 --> 17:07.819
<i>Lillian.</i>

17:15.993 --> 17:19.164
There was some cracked magic
in the air when I met your dad.

17:21.415 --> 17:27.923
We'd come from far-flung places,
me from Uganda and he from Syracuse,

17:27.923 --> 17:30.008
so we could fall in love in New York City.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.718
<i>Correction.</i>

17:32.261 --> 17:33.512
I loved your dad.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.305
<i>Correction.</i>

17:36.306 --> 17:39.643
I can't tell you
what being in romantic love is.

17:40.853 --> 17:43.480
I never felt true happiness
or contentment.

17:44.064 --> 17:48.652
All those tummy things people talk about?
I never felt those.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.406
Just blank spaces.

17:53.991 --> 17:58.078
Only from my son were those holes filled.

18:01.498 --> 18:05.460
I know that was no good either, Apollo.

18:06.545 --> 18:08.714
Putting all that pressure on a child.

18:09.590 --> 18:13.051
Burdening you with the weight of
all of my happiness.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.637
Loving you more than
I can ever love myself.

18:15.637 --> 18:18.015
And sometimes...

18:22.019 --> 18:24.730
hating the burden of loving you too.

18:26.523 --> 18:31.278
But us mothers mustn't speak of
such matters.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.655
The divine inconvenience.

18:35.407 --> 18:38.577
The grief, the sorrow, the regret.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.628
The anxiety of caring for a child.

18:52.758 --> 18:53.926
<i>Am I enough?</i>

18:59.598 --> 19:02.726
You are a burrowed tick in my mind.

19:03.727 --> 19:08.982
And it occurs to me, a mother is something
I can never not be again.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.571
Can I be mother enough?

19:17.115 --> 19:19.910
Well, now there is no choice.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.704
'Cause, kid, I'm all you've got.

19:27.793 --> 19:31.713
Of course, I had hopes and dreams.

19:34.299 --> 19:39.555
Don't we all grow up wishing on a star?

19:43.684 --> 19:45.602
I gave all my dreams to you.

19:48.438 --> 19:52.860
Okay. Before I tell you what I don't want
to tell you, let me first give him color.

19:57.489 --> 20:01.910
He was wounded deeply
by a mother who hated him.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.124
I think of it,
and I wrap him in my mind's arms.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.627
The dad was worse.

20:12.796 --> 20:18.218
But the betrayal of the mother
was something he could never get past.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.101
Should have served as a red flag.

20:29.646 --> 20:30.814
I was color-blind.

20:34.735 --> 20:39.907
Your dad loved you with fire,
but he also got satisfaction

20:39.907 --> 20:43.952
from achievements and other worlds
that didn't orbit you.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.956
- I was-- I am jealous of that.
- Officer West, congratulations

20:47.956 --> 20:49.583
and thank you
for an outstanding performance.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.668
Your father kept a lot of stuff.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.129
Stuff, stuff, stuff, boxes of it.

20:55.172 --> 20:58.217
<i>As if things were proof
he led a meaningful life.</i>

20:59.051 --> 21:01.929
<i>Things filled the void left by parents
who couldn't love him.</i>

21:03.180 --> 21:06.808
They say we are destined
to repeat our patterns.

21:06.808 --> 21:10.729
<i>And ta-da, he chose a woman
who couldn't love him either.</i>

21:11.980 --> 21:13.398
<i>But I needed him.</i>

21:14.608 --> 21:16.610
Needed him to cover my mistake.

21:27.037 --> 21:32.376
There would be times I would look
at him and think, "I hate you."

21:34.711 --> 21:39.424
And other times, he was the guy I chose.

21:39.925 --> 21:44.096
Because, boy, I knew he would love you.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.602
Pushing away all those gut warnings

21:51.103 --> 21:53.564
that told me something
wasn't quite right with him.

21:55.274 --> 21:56.275
<i>Something.</i>

21:57.776 --> 22:01.405
I didn't see the fissures
that led to the quake.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.243
I didn't see the reasons he chose me.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.458
Perfect fit.

22:15.919 --> 22:16.920
Wouldn't you know?

22:30.475 --> 22:31.560
He tells me--

22:31.560 --> 22:35.772
You make me so angry I wanna punch
the walls till my fingers are powder!

22:38.150 --> 22:39.318
<i>He also tells me--</i>

22:39.318 --> 22:42.738
You shine a light on me so strong
that I am blinded by it.

22:43.488 --> 22:48.118
We live day-to-day
somewhere between those two extremes.

23:29.076 --> 23:32.996
Fucking cheap-shit broken city.
The hell we paying taxes for?

23:32.996 --> 23:35.958
You never paid a cent
to the taxman in your life.

23:37.292 --> 23:38.293
Lady!

24:11.076 --> 24:12.494
<i>That's someone's son.</i>

24:15.330 --> 24:16.331
I know.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.764
<i>Who fills each role?</i>

24:38.729 --> 24:39.730
<i>And why?</i>

24:48.113 --> 24:52.534
Thank you. I'm scared of the dark.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.287
The morning always comes.

24:56.205 --> 24:58.832
I was beginning to think I didn't exist.

25:03.128 --> 25:04.129
Is this heaven?

25:06.340 --> 25:07.841
The exact opposite.

25:08.342 --> 25:09.927
I want my money back.

25:09.927 --> 25:13.096
I ain't paying for no goddamn room
with holes in the ceiling.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.973
Light and heat from candles?

25:14.973 --> 25:17.643
No one else would have you
in their place, Angelica.

25:17.643 --> 25:22.481
Fuck you, Lester. Fuck you
and your shitty-ass excuse of a hotel.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.565
Where's your mama?

25:24.149 --> 25:25.734
She's in Massachusetts.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.361
I'm done with this place.

25:27.361 --> 25:30.697
I'm telling you,
I'm taking my business to The Duchess.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.283
- I won't miss you.
- The Elk Hotel is a haven

25:33.283 --> 25:35.285
for roaches and rat shit.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.870
If you get sick at The Elk,

25:36.870 --> 25:40.457
it's from dope smoke and mold inhalation.

25:40.958 --> 25:43.710
The service is nil. You come here to die.

25:44.211 --> 25:46.547
- She never leaves.
- This here? This is a no-tel.

25:46.547 --> 25:51.844
That's my review. Zero stars! You asshole!

25:52.511 --> 25:56.723
Where I come from, when you get sick,
your family takes care of you.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.977
Where I come from,
they used to burn witches.

26:02.312 --> 26:03.355
How you end up here?

26:04.439 --> 26:06.358
Series of wrong turns.

26:07.192 --> 26:08.318
You shouldn't be alone.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.072
I haven't slept in so long.

26:14.575 --> 26:18.537
When I can't sleep,
I pretend my bed is a boat.

26:19.913 --> 26:22.457
And the bed is drifting off to sea.

26:23.292 --> 26:28.380
I have to lie right in the center,
no limbs hanging over the sides,

26:29.089 --> 26:34.219
because otherwise a shark might jump up
and snatch a foot or an arm.

26:35.387 --> 26:37.598
That doesn't sound very relaxing.

26:40.017 --> 26:41.018
Maybe not.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.188
Why are you staying here?

26:44.688 --> 26:46.064
<i>I know what you did.</i>

26:53.363 --> 26:54.573
Can I get you some water?

26:57.910 --> 26:58.911
Anything?

27:00.579 --> 27:01.830
I miss my mom.

27:09.171 --> 27:10.631
I'm gonna die tonight.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.391
Me too.

27:25.938 --> 27:26.939
Came here with Bill.

27:29.399 --> 27:32.236
I told my mom that it was
a bunch of us sightseeing.

27:34.321 --> 27:36.198
And Bill told his wife it was business.

27:37.574 --> 27:40.369
We'd heard about it. This thing
that had been affecting our people.

27:40.369 --> 27:41.453
Bill was scared.

27:42.913 --> 27:45.707
I didn't tell him
that I'd started to feel bad.

27:47.084 --> 27:51.380
Badder, because, well,
we had tickets to see Lena.

27:53.465 --> 27:56.552
Third row. Right up front.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.806
And the idea of not experiencing
her "Stormy Weather," I don't know.

28:02.516 --> 28:04.101
The end of the dream was coming anyway,

28:04.101 --> 28:07.855
and not seeing her would somehow
mean that it had all meant nothing.

28:07.855 --> 28:10.232
All the anger
and the hiding and the confusion.

28:12.401 --> 28:13.819
We came in on a bus.

28:13.819 --> 28:16.613
People must've thought that he was my dad
or something.

28:19.283 --> 28:20.284
Then it happened.

28:22.202 --> 28:25.455
It was really sudden,
like a change in the weather.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.082
Just, the cough got bad,

28:27.082 --> 28:29.459
and the people started staring at me, disgusted.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.754
I was running a fever, sweat dripping.

28:33.547 --> 28:35.340
I could see the look in his eyes.

28:36.842 --> 28:37.843
That was two months ago.

28:37.843 --> 28:40.846
We stayed at a nice place
and then his wife called.

28:40.846 --> 28:44.266
An emergency.
He had to go back, but he would return.

28:44.266 --> 28:46.226
He was gonna come back in time for Lena.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.021
And when he didn't...

28:51.064 --> 28:53.692
I just-- I tore that room apart
like a loaded rock star,

28:53.692 --> 28:55.027
looking for those tickets.

28:56.945 --> 28:58.447
Couldn't find them anywhere.

28:58.447 --> 29:01.074
I didn't have much money.
I kept having these blackouts.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.993
I know I should have used what I had left.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.077
I know I should've.

29:04.077 --> 29:06.038
I should've got a bus back home.

29:06.622 --> 29:07.748
But I couldn't do it.

29:08.749 --> 29:09.750
I couldn't.

29:10.459 --> 29:12.085
I couldn't do that to my mom.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.131
Just imagine what that would do to her.

29:16.632 --> 29:20.260
You know, seeing the perfect body
that she delivered into the world

29:20.260 --> 29:21.845
all rotted and ruined.

29:25.974 --> 29:28.977
So I found this place,
and I gave Lester the rest of my cash.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.650
I get that he has a wife
and all that stuff.

29:36.276 --> 29:37.319
I get it.

29:37.945 --> 29:38.946
But I wish...

29:40.697 --> 29:41.990
I just wish I could...

29:43.951 --> 29:46.578
I don't even mind it all ending
up here in this room.

29:47.162 --> 29:49.790
But I wish I could have seen her sing
"Stormy Weather."

29:51.416 --> 29:53.877
I wish I had that image in my mind...

29:55.504 --> 29:58.549
so that I could just picture it
at the exact last moment.

29:59.383 --> 30:00.384
You know?

30:02.094 --> 30:05.055
Like I could just imagine
Lena just holding that last note

30:05.055 --> 30:06.723
as the curtains finally close.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.196
Sleep tight.

35:27.044 --> 35:29.505
<i>No. She would not pray.</i>

35:29.505 --> 35:30.881
No god of mine.

35:37.429 --> 35:38.430
Angelica!

35:40.057 --> 35:41.058
Angelica!

35:42.684 --> 35:44.728
Help me.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.563
- Hey, man! Get outta here!
- Hey! Let go now.

35:46.563 --> 35:48.482
- Let her go right now.
- This has nothing to do with you.

35:48.482 --> 35:50.150
No one's ever gonna see you again.

35:50.150 --> 35:51.652
- You're gonna find yourself...
- I paid.

35:51.652 --> 35:54.112
...stuffed in a suitcase
at the bottom of a river. Get up!

35:54.112 --> 35:56.073
- Get up!
- Hey.

35:56.073 --> 35:57.741
Hey, man. Come on.

35:57.741 --> 36:00.494
Hey. Dude! Put it down!

36:00.494 --> 36:01.954
I'm gonna give you a shot
to get outta here.

36:01.954 --> 36:04.873
If you don't take it,
you see that stain on the wall over there?

36:04.873 --> 36:06.708
That's gonna be what's left of you too.

36:06.708 --> 36:08.335
Now, go! Go!

36:10.838 --> 36:12.881
Angelica. It's okay.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.800
It's okay. I got you.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.177
It's okay. He's gone.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.262
I got you.

36:19.096 --> 36:22.558
Who's gonna come find me?

36:24.101 --> 36:25.477
I don't exist.

36:25.477 --> 36:29.022
You do. I'm looking at you.
You're right where you need to be.

36:30.899 --> 36:33.735
I got you.

36:42.327 --> 36:43.745
<i>What would happen to her?</i>

36:44.246 --> 36:45.789
<i>What would she tell Apollo?</i>

36:45.789 --> 36:47.165
<i>How would she tell him?</i>

36:51.211 --> 36:52.421
I'm coming for you!

36:54.214 --> 36:56.133
Who's gonna help you shoot a basket?

36:57.926 --> 37:01.471
Who's gonna teach you the rules of
American sport games?

37:01.471 --> 37:03.724
Sandcastles I can do.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.767
Changing light-bulbs.

37:05.767 --> 37:08.187
Removing spiders from tubs.

37:08.187 --> 37:11.690
But handmade Father's Day projects
at school?

37:11.690 --> 37:13.317
What if something happens to me?

37:14.651 --> 37:16.236
What if I die in the night?

37:16.862 --> 37:18.530
No one will come for you.

37:19.031 --> 37:21.241
Because no one knows you're alone.

37:28.624 --> 37:31.877
How do you tell a child
his daddy isn't coming back?

37:37.758 --> 37:41.762
Apollo, you felt he didn't want you,

37:42.721 --> 37:44.681
but it was precisely the opposite.

37:45.766 --> 37:47.184
He wanted you too much.

37:54.316 --> 37:58.278
You shine a light on me so strong,
I am blinded by it.

37:58.946 --> 38:00.239
I need to explain.

38:00.989 --> 38:02.199
I need an explanation.

38:02.866 --> 38:04.243
It was a really hot day.

38:04.826 --> 38:05.827
Humid too.

38:06.870 --> 38:10.499
We took the tramway to Roosevelt Island
to have a picnic by the water.

38:11.917 --> 38:13.168
Tuna salad.

38:15.254 --> 38:16.338
Kinda boring, huh?

38:18.090 --> 38:19.007
What did you say?

38:19.007 --> 38:20.509
I ain't say nothing.

38:20.509 --> 38:23.554
And it was the first time
he didn't say anything that wasn't,

38:24.054 --> 38:25.722
"Oh, Lillian, you're so beautiful."

38:26.223 --> 38:28.767
"Lillian, you are a rose in a landfill."

38:28.767 --> 38:31.812
Hey, Lillian, you know this whole island
used to be an insane asylum?

38:31.812 --> 38:33.772
- No.
- Yeah.

38:34.273 --> 38:35.649
Luxury apartments now.

38:36.441 --> 38:37.442
Probably haunted, huh?

38:38.735 --> 38:39.820
Hey, you see that right there,

38:39.820 --> 38:41.405
the-- that lighthouse?

38:41.405 --> 38:42.614
That lighthouse right there,

38:42.614 --> 38:45.242
that used to light the way
for the ships bringing in the wackos.

38:45.826 --> 38:47.202
You know, you're pretty crazy.

38:47.703 --> 38:49.288
You are certifiable.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.790
I'd get you put in there. I could.

38:51.790 --> 38:52.875
You know, back in the day,

38:52.875 --> 38:56.712
husbands, they would have their wives
put in that place for, like, masturbation

38:56.712 --> 38:58.922
or menstrual problems, or even smoking.

39:00.632 --> 39:02.176
Except it's not funny, is it?

39:03.177 --> 39:04.720
If you're one of those women?

39:04.720 --> 39:08.599
<i>Novel reading,
ill-treatment by a husband, laziness,</i>

39:08.599 --> 39:12.186
<i>political excitement, asthma, bad company.</i>

39:12.686 --> 39:16.899
You know, if something like that
ever happened to you, no one would know.

39:18.108 --> 39:21.111
Like, your family and that,
you know, because they're all gone.

39:21.987 --> 39:22.988
So sad.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.575
<i>And it felt like a threat...</i>

39:27.826 --> 39:30.037
and I felt a door shut inside of me.

39:31.538 --> 39:32.998
It's my fault...

39:35.042 --> 39:38.086
that I didn't listen to words
said over tuna salad

39:39.713 --> 39:41.632
on the banks of Roosevelt Island.

39:42.341 --> 39:43.342
His and theirs.

39:43.342 --> 39:46.512
<i>A storm is coming. A storm is coming.</i>

39:46.512 --> 39:48.096
A storm is coming.

39:49.473 --> 39:50.891
A storm is coming.

39:52.226 --> 39:53.685
A storm is coming.

39:56.313 --> 39:58.190
If I could teach you anything,

40:00.067 --> 40:01.485
it's to look for the signs.

40:03.779 --> 40:04.780
He said...

40:04.780 --> 40:05.948
You don't exist.

40:05.948 --> 40:07.199
Excuse me?

40:08.075 --> 40:10.327
And I started living in a kind of fear.

40:11.662 --> 40:14.122
He really didn't do anything wrong though.

40:15.249 --> 40:16.583
Apollo, know that.

40:17.876 --> 40:21.964
Not until he said...

40:37.271 --> 40:39.022
Apollo's finally sleeping.

40:39.857 --> 40:40.941
Knock, knock.

40:40.941 --> 40:42.025
Who's there?

40:43.360 --> 40:44.361
Banana.

40:44.361 --> 40:45.904
- <i>Sometimes when I was sad...</i>
- Banana who?

40:45.904 --> 40:48.323
- Knock, knock.
- <i>...he would tell jokes, make me smile.</i>

40:48.323 --> 40:49.908
- Who's there?
- Banana.

40:49.908 --> 40:50.993
Banana who?

40:50.993 --> 40:52.911
<i>He was funny and sweet like that.</i>

40:52.911 --> 40:54.162
Who's there?

40:54.162 --> 40:55.497
Orange.

40:55.497 --> 40:56.582
Orange who?

40:57.499 --> 40:59.251
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?

41:01.920 --> 41:02.921
Hey, Lillian.

41:05.841 --> 41:07.885
I will know you until we are dust.

41:09.094 --> 41:11.138
Why does that sound like a threat?

41:11.638 --> 41:13.724
<i>He'd found the receipt and confronted her.</i>

41:13.724 --> 41:15.267
<i>She'd sworn up and down</i>

41:15.267 --> 41:19.479
<i>she didn't know where that bill for a stay
at The Elk Hotel on 9th and 42nd</i>

41:19.479 --> 41:20.564
<i>had come from.</i>

41:20.564 --> 41:23.275
- We'd just got together, Lillian.
- I don't know what this is.

41:23.275 --> 41:25.277
<i>An affair in this shitty hotel?</i>

41:26.111 --> 41:26.987
<i>Laughable.</i>

41:26.987 --> 41:28.655
<i>He thought it was her boss.</i>

41:28.655 --> 41:29.740
Charles Blackwood.

41:33.243 --> 41:34.244
<i>As if.</i>

41:34.953 --> 41:38.081
<i>As if she would deign
to spend time in a place like this</i>

41:39.291 --> 41:40.918
<i>with a man like that.</i>

41:40.918 --> 41:42.294
He's married.

41:42.294 --> 41:43.504
With two children.

41:43.504 --> 41:45.797
Oh, yeah?
You sure know a lot about him, huh?

41:45.797 --> 41:48.258
He keeps their pictures on his desk.

41:49.593 --> 41:51.970
You started saying
he was knocking at the door.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.096
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

41:53.889 --> 41:55.641
I go back to work
when you are two months old.

41:55.641 --> 41:56.725
I have to.

41:57.351 --> 41:59.937
I'm shattered from getting up
through the night to feed you,

41:59.937 --> 42:01.563
and then working, and then home.

42:03.023 --> 42:04.066
I got angry.

42:04.775 --> 42:05.817
I scolded him.

42:06.818 --> 42:07.945
I withdrew.

42:08.862 --> 42:11.281
I planned. I plotted my escape.

42:12.407 --> 42:15.202
Apollo, if you ever have a child,

42:15.827 --> 42:19.456
the cruelest act
is to rip him from his mother, months old,

42:19.957 --> 42:21.542
and have her go back to work.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.419
Don't ever do that, Apollo.

42:24.419 --> 42:26.046
Unless you wanna see crazy.

42:26.046 --> 42:27.214
<i>Knock, knock!</i>

42:27.756 --> 42:28.757
We split up.

42:29.258 --> 42:30.634
That part's obvious.

42:30.634 --> 42:32.594
And now I see him in every color.

42:33.554 --> 42:35.222
You are screwed now, girl.

42:35.222 --> 42:37.474
- You're going to wake my baby.
- "My baby"?

42:37.474 --> 42:39.643
I'm petrified
he will take my child from me.

42:39.643 --> 42:41.270
And I will never see you again.

42:41.270 --> 42:42.813
Everything seems lost.

42:43.897 --> 42:45.858
He's the American I would kill to be.

42:47.025 --> 42:48.068
He has all the power.

42:49.611 --> 42:51.029
You're just like my mother.

42:51.029 --> 42:52.489
That's a stinging cut.

42:52.489 --> 42:56.285
I take the little scar, and I add it
to my collection of little scars

42:56.285 --> 42:57.369
and I'm panicking.

42:57.870 --> 43:02.249
He speaks to me in this wary tone,
because he's convinced himself I'm crazy.

43:02.249 --> 43:05.878
He has to believe it,
so he can amputate me and take you.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.629
I would like to say...

43:07.629 --> 43:09.923
Fuck you! Who do you think you are?

43:09.923 --> 43:11.008
But I can't.

43:11.508 --> 43:13.468
I would like to smash him
in the fucking face,

43:13.468 --> 43:15.053
but he's the American.

43:15.053 --> 43:17.306
No one's coming to get you, Lillian.
You understand that?

43:17.306 --> 43:20.851
It is simple. Nobody's coming to get you
because no one who loves you is left.

43:23.187 --> 43:24.646
And then the earthquake erupts.

43:25.314 --> 43:29.902
He's come to visit you. It's a Saturday,
and he finds this hotel bill.

43:30.444 --> 43:34.448
And I can't imagine where he found it
unless he planted it on me himself.

43:34.448 --> 43:36.783
He's raging,
even though we're not together anymore.

43:36.783 --> 43:38.285
He's out of his mind.

43:39.203 --> 43:42.748
The vein bulging in his neck.
His eyes on fire.

43:42.748 --> 43:45.918
He's saying if he can't have me,
no one can.

43:45.918 --> 43:48.378
No other man is raising my son!

43:48.378 --> 43:49.505
Your son?

43:49.505 --> 43:51.632
My son. I will take you to court.

43:51.632 --> 43:53.008
I will finish you, Lillian.

43:53.008 --> 43:55.511
You say goodbye. It is all over.

43:55.511 --> 43:58.805
I would never! Could never! Have never!

43:59.723 --> 44:01.266
When would I even have the time?

44:01.767 --> 44:04.520
What do you imagine sleeping with my boss
would actually do for me?

44:04.520 --> 44:07.856
Liar!

44:08.440 --> 44:09.900
You're all glamour, Lillian.

44:09.900 --> 44:12.986
You only appear as you wish to be seen!

44:16.323 --> 44:18.033
And then I come home one day.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.870
I've bought a Happy Meal for you.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.414
You always ate the fries first.

44:26.917 --> 44:27.918
I come home...

44:31.129 --> 44:34.258
and I see something I can never unsee.

44:38.136 --> 44:40.180
And so I turn off the light.

44:41.723 --> 44:44.434
<i>Our bed was a boat when we cannot sleep.</i>

44:44.434 --> 44:48.438
<i>But you, Lillian, you were the shark.</i>

44:49.731 --> 44:50.732
<i>A cop?</i>

44:51.400 --> 44:53.777
<i>A white American cop, of all people?</i>

44:54.653 --> 44:57.489
<i>They would burn her for what she'd done.
They would vanish her.</i>

44:58.073 --> 44:59.658
You are a fucking liar!

44:59.658 --> 45:00.909
But he's the American.

45:00.909 --> 45:04.371
<i>Like the women before her
and the witches before them.</i>

45:05.038 --> 45:06.373
I'm coming for you!

45:17.968 --> 45:18.969
The answer is no.

45:20.846 --> 45:22.222
I can never be enough.

45:23.891 --> 45:27.269
The mom I want to be is not the mom I am.

45:31.023 --> 45:32.900
What I've taken from you, Son.

45:32.900 --> 45:34.193
Mommy!

45:35.986 --> 45:37.404
What I've erased.

45:46.163 --> 45:47.873
The mom I am is just like he said--

45:49.416 --> 45:51.126
The mom I am--

45:51.126 --> 45:53.045
- The mom I am--
- Hey!

45:54.922 --> 45:55.797
No.

45:56.715 --> 45:58.926
No.

45:59.510 --> 46:01.803
This is not how Lillian's story ends.

46:02.971 --> 46:05.432
She came inside and closed the window.

46:07.559 --> 46:10.771
Imagine the cheek of asking someone
to scrape you off the sidewalk.

46:10.771 --> 46:13.273
I can't.

46:13.273 --> 46:15.442
She came inside. Oh, my God.

46:27.246 --> 46:28.413
Who are you?

46:28.413 --> 46:29.831
Bad things in this world.

46:30.874 --> 46:32.709
But nothing so bad is worth that fall.

46:33.627 --> 46:35.128
Brian West doesn't win!

46:37.881 --> 46:39.591
Just a dark night of the soul.

46:39.591 --> 46:42.553
Lillian had lost her connection
to anything higher.

46:44.972 --> 46:48.517
A dark night
calls for a spiritual response.

46:49.893 --> 46:51.186
Are you God?

46:53.355 --> 46:54.356
A lady God?

46:56.817 --> 46:57.818
I knew it.

47:00.988 --> 47:02.447
Are you here to punish me?

47:03.198 --> 47:07.369
<i>Lillian, ask help from the spirits</i>

47:07.369 --> 47:10.247
<i>when you have used all your strength.</i>

47:15.085 --> 47:17.296
Do you think
you should be punished, Lillian?

47:19.464 --> 47:21.133
Haven't you always felt that?

47:22.968 --> 47:23.969
Because you left.

47:27.264 --> 47:30.350
Because you survived.

47:32.186 --> 47:34.771
Because of the lie
you told to your husband and child?

47:37.107 --> 47:38.609
For all you've done?

47:39.359 --> 47:40.569
Should you be punished?

47:42.196 --> 47:43.572
I'll believe.

47:44.281 --> 47:46.950
I promise I'll believe.

47:48.035 --> 47:50.370
Hail Mary, full of grace.

47:51.955 --> 47:52.956
The Lord--

47:53.498 --> 47:54.791
Blessed is--

47:55.876 --> 47:57.044
I don't know this one.

47:57.044 --> 47:59.922
Attempting to leave your son
alone in this world?

48:01.173 --> 48:02.341
Should you be punished?

48:06.929 --> 48:08.138
I'll make a deal with you.

48:10.057 --> 48:12.809
Please, I'll do anything.

48:15.187 --> 48:16.813
Are you here to tell me what to do?

48:17.731 --> 48:21.944
Lillian wondered,
was there another woman somewhere

48:21.944 --> 48:23.237
on her knees,

48:24.071 --> 48:27.950
making a deal
for the son that was lying in room 200?

48:30.911 --> 48:31.954
I won't leave.

48:34.164 --> 48:35.165
I am his mother.

48:37.793 --> 48:39.253
That's all I ever need to be.

48:40.921 --> 48:41.922
I'll be a good one.

48:43.465 --> 48:44.466
I promise.

48:44.466 --> 48:46.093
I'll be the best one I can be.

48:49.096 --> 48:50.138
I'll do anything.

48:53.392 --> 48:56.270
If you let me get away with this thing.

49:00.482 --> 49:04.152
If you make it go away, somehow.

49:06.989 --> 49:08.490
These deals we make,

49:10.325 --> 49:11.326
they're real.

49:14.037 --> 49:19.543
What Lillian didn't know
was that 35 years from this very day,

49:20.127 --> 49:22.754
Apollo Kagwa would pay the price

49:22.754 --> 49:25.132
for the bargain
his mother made in this room.

49:29.219 --> 49:30.804
What did you say?

49:31.471 --> 49:32.472
Nothing.

49:32.973 --> 49:34.683
The gods will take what they are owed.

49:35.225 --> 49:37.269
<i>You're gonna find yourself
stuffed in a suitcase</i>

49:37.269 --> 49:38.604
<i>at the bottom of a river.</i>

49:45.611 --> 49:46.945
And then it came to Lillian.

49:47.613 --> 49:51.742
The answer to her problem
had been in this room all along.

49:53.035 --> 49:54.661
She didn't need to confess.

49:55.621 --> 49:57.372
She didn't need to call the police.

49:58.624 --> 50:00.542
She didn't need to tell Apollo.

50:01.126 --> 50:04.338
She can make it go away all herself.

50:04.338 --> 50:06.381
<i>I know what you did, Lillian. I know!</i>

50:06.381 --> 50:07.633
Do be quiet!

50:07.633 --> 50:09.635
You don't get to win, asshole.

50:12.429 --> 50:13.680
Lillian realized

50:15.015 --> 50:19.561
that no one in the whole wide world
needed to know.

50:19.561 --> 50:20.771
Ever.

50:21.647 --> 50:24.942
She would go carefully, thoroughly.

50:26.068 --> 50:27.778
She had decided to eat the dog,

50:28.987 --> 50:32.533
and it was indeed a fat one.

50:35.953 --> 50:37.996
But for all his talk,

50:37.996 --> 50:44.628
Brian hadn't anyone who cared
whether he was alive or dead either.

50:50.843 --> 50:52.928
There is nothing we will not do...

50:52.928 --> 50:54.763
For the ones we love.

51:01.228 --> 51:05.524
Lillian remembered a long-ago promise.

51:07.025 --> 51:08.777
One she'd forgotten she made.

51:12.656 --> 51:15.158
I will never let anything happen to you.

51:17.995 --> 51:21.790
I will protect you
with my breath and soul.

51:23.333 --> 51:25.252
With every molecule.

51:44.271 --> 51:45.898
And she kept that promise.

51:49.151 --> 51:51.737
She was the mother she had vowed to be.

51:55.032 --> 51:58.619
And look, the sun is peeking through.

52:01.288 --> 52:03.081
Time to turn the light back on.

53:54.026 --> 53:58.113
<i>Lillian could finally believe
that things were going to be better</i>

53:58.113 --> 54:02.618
<i>than they'd been since the day
she stepped foot on this country's soil.</i>

54:03.202 --> 54:06.163
<i>She felt American.</i>

56:01.778 --> 56:05.282
<i>It would be accurate to say
that Lillian's first child--</i>

56:05.282 --> 56:06.533
<i>and only child--</i>

56:07.284 --> 56:10.913
<i>was conceived
in the beautiful blur of 1977.</i>

56:16.084 --> 56:20.088
<i>In America, we rewrite history
by erasing it.</i>

56:25.928 --> 56:27.930
<i>But history will not stay buried,</i>

56:29.014 --> 56:30.724
<i>deals cannot be unmade,</i>

56:32.017 --> 56:33.852
<i>and gods will take their pay.</i>
