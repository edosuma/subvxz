00:48.215 --> 00:49.381
Fuck!

00:51.151 --> 00:52.284
Okay.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.645
What the fuck?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.729
What the... what the fuck?

02:14.401 --> 02:16.879
What the fuck?

02:16.903 --> 02:19.271
What the fuck?!

04:17.457 --> 04:19.101
<i>In the next hour,</i>

04:19.125 --> 04:22.505
<i>two candidates are in a tight race
heading into the Iowa Caucus...</i>

04:36.343 --> 04:40.423
<i>An update on the Colorado
missing persons case</i>

04:40.447 --> 04:41.724
<i>we've been covering all week.</i>

04:41.748 --> 04:43.626
<i>Five people
were found dead today</i>

04:43.650 --> 04:46.429
<i>in a warehouse outside
Wheat Ridge, a Denver suburb.</i>

04:46.453 --> 04:48.998
<i>In a public statement,

04:49.022 --> 04:52.735
<i>they were all killed
in "a ritualistic manner."</i>

04:52.759 --> 04:55.938

05:09.809 --> 05:11.420
<i>the weather this weekend
looks terrible.</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:34.544
What'd you get me?

05:34.568 --> 05:37.413
What did I get you?
Yeah, what'd you get me?

05:37.437 --> 05:40.483
You'll see.
Is it lacy and frilly?

05:42.542 --> 05:43.586
I'm intrigued.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.697
Do you know how you always leave
your stuff in my bathroom?

05:54.721 --> 05:57.533
Yeah, you hate it.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.535
Do you know why I hate it?

05:59.559 --> 06:03.038
Because it's girls' stuff and
it's not a girl's bathroom.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.831
But it could be.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.042
We should talk about it.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.691
We should <i> talk</i> about it...

06:22.715 --> 06:27.530
After this long, completely
avoiding the subject.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.587
Sure.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.426
Seriously?

06:37.831 --> 06:39.531
Seriously.

06:41.768 --> 06:42.978
Deal?

06:43.002 --> 06:44.980
Deal.
Hey?

06:45.004 --> 06:45.981
Yeah?
Shake.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.683
All right.
Deal.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.018
Pleasure doing
business with you.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.086
Nice doing business with you.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.495
Thank you.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.816
Big brother!
Hi.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.551
Hi! You look great.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.854
He really cleans up, doesn't he?
Yeah!

07:24.878 --> 07:27.656
Finally!
Birthday boy! Hey!

07:27.680 --> 07:30.092
Happy birthday! Oh.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.028
Yeah! Hey, there he is.
Sorry, everyone.

07:33.052 --> 07:34.563
My fault.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.132
My keen instinct told me
you would all be here,

07:37.156 --> 07:38.567
so naturally I had to change

07:38.591 --> 07:40.703
to dress down to your level.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.272
Ha ha.
So selfless, even on your birthday.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.940
You're welcome.
Yeah.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.575
Well, we've been
celebrating without you.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.578
Mm.
Mm. Hey, bud, one more bottle.

07:49.602 --> 07:53.549
My wife ordered
for you already. Halibut.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.084
Prime filet. Rare.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.552
Hmm.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.254
Crab.
Yes.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.556
Burger with side of Brussels.
Mm-hmm.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.591
Chicken <i>piccata.</i>

08:02.615 --> 08:05.661
Salmon, no mushrooms.

08:05.685 --> 08:06.551
And Hadlee.

08:08.054 --> 08:08.965
Says she's filled up on bread,

08:08.989 --> 08:10.933
but ends up picking
at everyone else's food.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.137
I thought we'd all
like to share.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.572
Are we really that predictable?

08:16.596 --> 08:18.307
Not predictable...

08:18.331 --> 08:19.808
Committed.
Mm.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.277
Insane people are committed,

08:21.301 --> 08:23.812
or sell art at my gallery.

08:23.836 --> 08:24.980
We are steadfast.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.049
Or stubborn.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.086
How does it feel to be old?

08:31.110 --> 08:33.655
I asked him the same thing.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.323
How old am I again?
You're old.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.259
So old.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.727
Old enough to know
what you want.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.254
What do you want
for your birthday?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.603
A toast.
Yes, a toast.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.271
To my...
No, not your toast.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.675
It's not your toast.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.676
It's okay.
I'm still drinking.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.780
I thought it was
just a silly cliché,

08:57.804 --> 08:59.114
but you are living proof

08:59.138 --> 09:01.050
that things really
do get better with age.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.619
Okay, okay.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.121
Okay. Babe?

09:06.145 --> 09:08.824
I'm so thankful to celebrate
your birthday with you,

09:08.848 --> 09:12.194
and I'm looking forward
to many, many more.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.629
Hey, sweet.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.030
Cheers.
Cheers.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.121
Cheers.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.592
Mm.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.940
Oh!
What's this?

09:24.964 --> 09:26.775
I thought no presents
'til tomorrow's brunch.

09:26.799 --> 09:27.776
Yeah.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.045
I guess we're not all
predictable after all.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.147
You guys got him presents?

09:32.171 --> 09:33.882
Yeah, it's his birthday.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.783
What?

09:49.956 --> 09:52.334
Escape room?
Yep.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.069
Yeah.
What is that?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.037
You're locked in a room

09:55.061 --> 09:57.272
until you solve a series
of puzzles to get out.

09:57.296 --> 09:58.707
And you've only got one hour.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.409
No, that sounds horrible.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.877
That sounds really fun.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.946
I've heard
it's the latest craze.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.316
Remember that, um,
secret mask thing,

10:07.340 --> 10:08.351
the <i> Macbeth</i> thing
in New York last year?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.753
That wasn't an escape room.
I know.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.389
I'm just saying it's the
latest underground thing.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.590
They're popping up everywhere.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.360
I think Shakespeare in any
form is so fucking boring.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.729
Yeah.
I agree with you.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.931
This won't be.
I promise.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.268
What happens if we don't
figure it out in time?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.626
We're trapped.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.729
Forever.

10:35.702 --> 10:39.004
It's a challenge.
A test of intelligence.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.173
Hmm.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.991
All right, I'm in.
Where is this room?

10:49.015 --> 10:50.726
The mystery is part of the game.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.163
Ooo, exciting!
So how do we get there?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.230
I've arranged everything.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.200
I just need you to play along.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.869
How did <i> you...</i>
Oh!

11:00.893 --> 11:02.304
Come up with something
so adventurous?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.307
Excuse me! What,
are you surprised?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.876
Very surprised.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.069
Good. Happy birthday.

11:16.309 --> 11:19.988
Let's get drunk.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.461
Really, it's not necessary.
No, I'm just kidding.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.398
This is us.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.833
Oh!
Oooh!

11:30.857 --> 11:33.268
This is how to party.
Yes.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.570
Damn.
I want to come.

11:34.594 --> 11:38.407
Babe, we were so specific
about reservations.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.442
If we could ever
get ahold of you...

11:40.466 --> 11:41.844
Ugh, I'm so unlucky.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.968
No, honey,
you're just a wild card.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.750
Goodbye.
Come on, beautiful.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.919
It won't be the same
without you, kid.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.877
At least I already have plans.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.158
Do you want me
to call you a cab?

11:56.182 --> 12:00.852
I'll get a ride.
You guys have fun.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.867
How you gonna get home?
Oh, I'm not going home.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.469
This girl's got
a sexy party to go to.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.806
Sexy party.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.808
Ay, ay!

12:12.832 --> 12:14.910
Trouble.
Yeah.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.914
Oh, my God, that's good.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.350
Look at the... Oh, look
who decided to come in!

12:22.508 --> 12:24.019
Hey, buddy, there you are!

12:24.043 --> 12:25.888
What's up?
Happy birthday, man!

12:25.912 --> 12:27.879
Happy birthday!

12:39.091 --> 12:40.903
I love this stuff.
I know.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.372
This is amazing.
Thank you.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.096
Oh, don't thank me yet.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.905
Oh, come on.
Okay, guys.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.953
Gonna need
your cell phones, please.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.455
Um...

13:00.479 --> 13:02.491
Hell no.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.592
Yes.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.228
Can't have you looking up
how to solve a puzzle.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.462
No help from anyone.

13:07.486 --> 13:08.897
Uh...

13:11.390 --> 13:12.835
There's no lifelines
in this game?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.837
Come on!
No.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.305
For an hour?

13:16.329 --> 13:19.041
Come on, what's the big deal?

13:19.065 --> 13:20.042
As birthday ambassador,

13:20.066 --> 13:22.845
I order all of you
to relinquish your phones.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.502
Thank you.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.219
Hey, you know what?
Fuck it.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.888
Hand 'em over.
Here you go.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.923
Thank you.
Here.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.447
As you wish,
birthday ambassador.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.517
All righty. One more.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.323
What?
It's everyone or no one.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.860
Fine.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.309
Proud of you, Anderson.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.411
Fuck off.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.046
Ouch.
Why is he so mean to me?

13:58.070 --> 13:59.214
I love him and he's
so mean to me.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.984
All right, guys, I'm also
going to need your wallets,

14:02.008 --> 14:04.319
your purses, anything else
in your pockets.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.420
Fuck.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.956
All you can take with you
are your wits.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.025
And there's insurance on
this game and all, right?

14:10.049 --> 14:13.128
I take full responsibility for everything.
Okay.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.452
Thank you, Conrad.
You're welcome.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.566
All righty. Got it?
Nice.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.973
Happy birthday.

14:24.997 --> 14:28.543
Yeah!

14:28.567 --> 14:29.500
Whoo!

14:52.091 --> 14:53.568
Does anybody know how long
we've been driving for?

14:53.592 --> 14:56.672
How could we, when we
can't see anything?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.162
Let's just ask the driver.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.952
Maybe it's not supposed to open.

15:09.976 --> 15:11.353
It's all part of it.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.121
Christen, how'd you
find this place?

15:13.145 --> 15:15.390
They're everywhere.
Hiding in plain sight.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.225
What, is there
an escape room app?

15:17.249 --> 15:19.061
You just tap
and sign up? What?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.730
The Uber of entrapment games?

15:21.754 --> 15:24.389
No, no app. No nothing
on the Internet.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.926
Well, then how'd you find it?

15:28.995 --> 15:29.994
I got this.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.081
What is <i> that?</i>

15:39.105 --> 15:41.005
An invitation.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.631
It's cute.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.168
Yeah, but the question
is, who sent it?

16:00.192 --> 16:02.437
I don't know.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.274
But I know with all the research
I've been doing on escape rooms,

16:06.298 --> 16:08.010
my name got on some list,

16:08.034 --> 16:10.412
and this ended up in my mailbox.

16:10.436 --> 16:11.446
It's Morse code.

16:11.470 --> 16:17.152
It spells G-A-M-E.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.387
Game.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.056
Oh!

16:24.183 --> 16:27.229
What?
Oh.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.230
Huh.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.070
All right, that is cool.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.171
Yeah, that's awesome.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.005
Legit.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.472
Oh.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.056
Oh, what the fuck was that?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.414
We're here.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.840
You've got to be kidding me.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.542
It's all part of the game.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.169
Kinky.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.608
Well, I'm too buzzed to care
at this point anyway, so...

17:25.277 --> 17:28.156
I'm so nervous.
I got this, babe.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.291
Ugh.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.516
I'm so ready.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.198
All right. Let's do this.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.467
There's a team player.
Whoo-hoo!

17:38.491 --> 17:42.471
Ow! Ha ha!
Lock hands, everyone.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.839
I don't want to lose you
when I lead you out.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.308
Whoo!

17:46.332 --> 17:49.344
Yeah!
This is awesome.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.113
Whoo-hoo!

17:51.137 --> 17:52.147
You're not wearing one?

17:52.171 --> 17:55.250
Somebody's got to be in charge.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.385
Isn't that cheating?

17:57.409 --> 18:00.722
I don't cheat.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.085
But it's all part of the game.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.169
This is crazy.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.138
Where's your hand, Tabby?

18:16.162 --> 18:17.906
Both your hands are on my ass.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.708
That's exactly right.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.210
Jesus!
Okay, is everyone ready?

18:22.234 --> 18:23.545
Yeah, let's do it.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.280
Wait, Tyler, where's your hand?

18:25.304 --> 18:27.149
I'm... I'm right here.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.518
Jesus!
Well, that sounds safe.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.320
It's fine, you guys.
Don't touch your blindfolds.

18:32.344 --> 18:34.789
She swat me like a dog?
Yes, I did. You know what?

18:34.813 --> 18:36.558
If you behaved,
I wouldn't have to.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.734
I'm so turned on right now.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.458
Okay, shh, everyone!

18:49.295 --> 18:51.239
You have one hour.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.257
All right.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.197
Ow!

20:24.390 --> 20:26.290
Christen?

20:31.664 --> 20:34.232
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

20:46.645 --> 20:49.513
All right. All right.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.454
All right.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.503
Well, um...

21:01.527 --> 21:04.506
three.
Are you done yet?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.474
What are you talking about?
I'm talking to Christen.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.510
She's tying something
to my hands.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.879
Yeah, she tied something
to my wrists, too.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.381
I'm taking this thing off.

21:13.405 --> 21:16.418
You're not
playing the game right.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.629

At least I'm trying something.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.417
Okay.
Give me a break.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.698
All right. If I...

22:03.722 --> 22:06.434
If I just...
All right.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.738
That's... You're just
tying it up more.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.406
Okay.
No, that's...

22:11.430 --> 22:12.574
All right, just...

22:19.538 --> 22:22.751

<i>No, no.
No, that's...</i>

22:37.990 --> 22:39.934
Conrad?

22:44.763 --> 22:46.597
Wha... anybody?

22:49.435 --> 22:50.678
Boo!

22:50.702 --> 22:53.148
Oh, my God, you scared me!

22:53.172 --> 22:55.373
Oh, mission accomplished.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.456
Mm. You're so bad.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.058
Aw, you like it.

23:04.082 --> 23:05.427
Yeah, I do.

23:05.451 --> 23:08.652
Whoa.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.894
Okay, this is weird.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.564
This is sick.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.434
This is weird.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.515
What is <i> this?</i>

23:27.539 --> 23:28.483
Um, I don't know,

23:28.507 --> 23:32.454
but can we do something
about this first?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.826
Okay.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.627
Oh, my God.
What is this?

23:39.651 --> 23:40.962
I don't know. I thought
it was you grabbing me

23:40.986 --> 23:42.664
and I kind of liked it.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.566
I was blindfolded, Conrad.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.167
How would I have put
this on you?

23:46.191 --> 23:48.703
<i>God, I can't believe
Christen did this.</i>

23:56.902 --> 23:58.836
Really?

24:22.761 --> 24:26.841
All right. Um...

24:28.901 --> 24:30.512
Okay, how 'bout...

24:30.536 --> 24:34.983
How about if I do...
No.

24:35.007 --> 24:39.187
Okay, let's...
Just stop, Anderson.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.027
I'm trying to figure this out.

24:46.051 --> 24:48.563
Yeah, well, it's
obviously not working.

24:48.587 --> 24:51.799
It's a fucking puzzle. There
must be another solution.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.657
Like what?

24:56.728 --> 24:58.662
We have to work together, okay?

25:00.599 --> 25:02.010
Fine.

25:02.034 --> 25:05.613
All right.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.715
Okay, what did we do
before that hasn't worked?

25:07.739 --> 25:09.551
Like, we need
to rethink this thing.

25:09.575 --> 25:13.611
Well, we can't untie it. We
can't go around each other.

25:15.747 --> 25:17.592
How about if we go through it?

25:17.616 --> 25:19.027
Through it?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.696
Yeah, like this. Like through it.
Like through.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.666
<i>Like this.
Like through.</i>

25:24.690 --> 25:27.057
What? No, that's not right.
Yeah.

25:30.095 --> 25:33.942
Oh, no, no, no. You were
definitely on to something here.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.844
Okay, you put your hand here.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.947
What's the number?

25:38.971 --> 25:41.082
Tabby, it's part of the game.
You gotta figure it out.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.717
So there's a reason they put

25:42.741 --> 25:44.719
this horrible thing on you?

25:44.743 --> 25:45.676
Yeah, it's a clue.

25:47.346 --> 25:50.224
All right, so we have
to figure out a number

25:50.248 --> 25:53.294
that relates to the worst
pair of underwear ever.

25:53.318 --> 25:54.929
Yes, we do.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.767
<i>♪ Bill Spry ♪</i>

25:59.791 --> 26:03.037
Come on...
Do... this.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.373
No, I...
Wait.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.708
No, no, stop, stop, stop.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.765
I think I got it.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.648
<i>♪ Poor Bill, feelin' so ill ♪</i>

26:13.672 --> 26:16.618

26:21.980 --> 26:24.892
<i>♪ Take me back to dear... ♪</i>

26:28.720 --> 26:30.698
Nice!

26:30.722 --> 26:34.736
All right, let's find a key
to unlock this shit.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.339
Yeah. Let's do that.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.707
<i>So there are four numbers.</i>

26:39.731 --> 26:43.211
<i>Let's assume A is one,
B is two, and A-B-C.</i>

26:43.235 --> 26:45.980
You can't go higher than nine.
This is complicated.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.348
All right, babe,
let's brainstorm.

26:47.372 --> 26:50.284
Why would I be wearing
this belt?

26:50.308 --> 26:53.154
Mm... sex is definitely
out of the question.

26:53.178 --> 26:55.690
I think you nailed it.

26:55.714 --> 26:56.958
I'm definitely not nailing you.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.326
No, babe, what's
a four letter word

26:58.350 --> 27:00.828
that has to do with sex?

27:00.852 --> 27:01.829
"Fuck?"

27:01.853 --> 27:04.021
Uh-uh.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.803
That's too many digits.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.238
"Kink?"

27:10.262 --> 27:11.606
Oh, wait!
What about head?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.942
Okay, maybe we can talk about
<i>that</i> after we're done with this.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.744
No, babe, that's the answer.

27:16.768 --> 27:17.979
Oh.

27:19.071 --> 27:23.751
Okay, so H.
So... H, so eight.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.723
So E...
Babe.

27:28.747 --> 27:31.426
Yeah?
Five.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.783
All right.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.900
A is one. Okay.

27:38.924 --> 27:41.903
And D... Fuck.
Four.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.743
Ah!
Yeah!

27:48.767 --> 27:54.282
<i>Oh!</i>

27:54.306 --> 27:57.719
<i>We did it.
Yeah, we did. Now, I'm gonna do it.</i>

27:57.743 --> 28:01.956
<i>Oh, I like it.</i>

28:34.846 --> 28:36.491
Ah!
Anderson.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.494
Fuck! Tyler?

28:39.518 --> 28:42.163
You all right?

28:42.187 --> 28:45.500
Yeah, the fucking thing cut me
in the finger when it opened.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.835
Is Natasha with you?
I'm right here.

28:47.859 --> 28:51.205
Is Christen with you?
No, I'm alone.

28:51.229 --> 28:54.308
Oh, that sucks.

28:54.332 --> 28:55.943
Is there a knob on your side?

28:55.967 --> 28:58.846
Um... no.

28:58.870 --> 29:00.515
Just a latch
to this compartment.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.784
Guessing
you're knobless as well?

29:02.808 --> 29:04.786
Just a combination dial.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.454
What's the story in that room?

29:06.478 --> 29:07.889
I don't know.

29:07.913 --> 29:11.125
Thought it was decorated
by a bipolar novelist.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.983
Oh.
Where are you?

29:14.886 --> 29:16.798
My room is filled
with antique televisions

29:16.822 --> 29:18.856
and out of sync clocks,
too many to count.

29:20.225 --> 29:23.971
Ah. Aside from some
Davy Crockett shit,

29:23.995 --> 29:27.108
we have clocks in here, too.
Huh.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.869
Uh, they don't seem
to be working, though.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.238
How many are there?

29:35.907 --> 29:36.774
Four.

29:38.977 --> 29:42.223
And all of them are stopped?
Looks like it.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.526
They're all stopped on an hour.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.251
Okay, are they all stopped
on different hours?

29:48.587 --> 29:50.064
Yes.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.934
Okay. Tell me the times
on the clocks.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.370
Uh, 12 and six,

29:56.394 --> 29:58.472
five, and eight.

30:04.035 --> 30:07.215
Damn it.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.986
Okay, where are the clocks?

30:12.010 --> 30:14.989
I don't know.
All over the room.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.090
What?

30:16.114 --> 30:18.226
There are two on the left
hand side of the door

30:18.250 --> 30:19.293
and two on the other.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.095
All right, of the clocks
on the left,

30:21.119 --> 30:22.897
what is the time on the one
furthest from the door?

30:22.921 --> 30:24.098
Uh, 12.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.637
And the first clock
on the right hand side?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.528
Uh, five.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.409
Second one on the left?

30:35.433 --> 30:37.334
Six.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.883
And the last one on the right.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.373
And eight.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.896
Shit.

30:54.920 --> 30:58.132
You did it.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.567
No problem.

30:59.591 --> 31:03.337
Wow, fashionable.
Yeah.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.406
We'll see.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.498
Guys.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.084
All right.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.587
It works.

31:31.489 --> 31:35.102
Hey, there's a card here.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.337
Wonder what it's doing there.

31:36.361 --> 31:40.608
Is it a piece to a puzzle?
I don't know.

31:40.632 --> 31:41.665
Yeah...

31:46.304 --> 31:48.906
Is this... Is this
how you took it out?

31:53.478 --> 31:54.945
Now what?

31:57.649 --> 32:00.161
Yikes.

32:00.185 --> 32:01.996
Exactly.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.265
Well, the only way out
is the exit door,

32:04.289 --> 32:06.233
which I assume will open
when we win.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.025
<i>If</i> we win.

32:10.128 --> 32:12.406
Anderson. Come on.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.076
We just killed that first puzzle
without breaking a sweat.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.044
Don't you want to win?

32:17.068 --> 32:19.013
We're going to get out of here in
record time. Just get on board.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.082
All right. Lead the way,
birthday boy.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.484
But how do you suspect we're gonna
find the others if there are no doors?

32:23.508 --> 32:25.553
It's all gotta be
part of the game.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.659
What are you looking for?
I don't know.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.128
That narrows it down.

32:34.152 --> 32:36.030
Oh, come on, Anderson.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.566
There has to be something
that leads to the next thing.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.401
You know, like a clue?

32:40.425 --> 32:42.169
Oh, really?

32:42.193 --> 32:44.328
So do you mind
enlightening me, then?

32:46.464 --> 32:48.676
All right.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.481
Okay, well, how about these?

32:53.505 --> 32:57.084
They're a series of animal
paintings in a line.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.754
So what?

32:59.778 --> 33:02.123
So it could be a clue!
I don't know.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.981
Yes!

33:14.192 --> 33:17.238
I bet it's based on weight.
Take those off.

33:17.262 --> 33:18.528
Oh, yeah.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.680
It's the food chain.

33:26.704 --> 33:28.071
Brilliant.
Trade me.

33:31.409 --> 33:33.054
Rabbit.

33:33.078 --> 33:36.380
Fox.
Coyote.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.795
Whoa. What?

33:49.461 --> 33:51.105
Seriously?

33:51.129 --> 33:53.130
Slackers.

33:54.432 --> 33:55.799
Typical.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.615
Hi. Oh, yeah?

34:01.639 --> 34:03.384
You guys busy?
Hmm?

34:03.408 --> 34:04.574
We can't hear you.

34:07.178 --> 34:08.178
We can't hear you.

34:11.248 --> 34:14.251
We... we can't
hear you.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.831
Oh, my God.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.134
It's like he doesn't know
it's my sister.

34:24.161 --> 34:27.875
Hey, where do you think
that door leads to?

34:27.899 --> 34:30.244
Well, it looks like it's
connected to the other room.

34:30.268 --> 34:31.812
But there is no door
in the other room.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.047
I <i> know</i> that,

34:33.071 --> 34:35.516
but you're telling me that doesn't
look like it's connected?

34:35.540 --> 34:36.784
Oh, it's definitely connected.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.790
What're you doing?

35:00.565 --> 35:03.310
Oh!
Whoa!

35:03.334 --> 35:06.514
Wow. Fuck.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.673
Ah.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.578
Oh, so there <i> was</i> a door.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.419
Here.

35:26.691 --> 35:29.159
Thank you.
You're welcome.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.163
All right, let's
get rid of these clocks.

35:38.369 --> 35:40.303
Okay, so where's the key?

35:43.374 --> 35:45.553
How about the ones
that unlocked the ropes?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.511
Ah. Yeah.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.158
Stop it.

36:02.627 --> 36:05.762
What? Come on.

36:13.404 --> 36:14.848
There's no way
this is gonna fit.

36:14.872 --> 36:15.983
Nice.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.319
It was your fucking idea.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.853
Look, there's gotta be
a key here somewhere,

36:19.877 --> 36:21.222
let's just find it.

36:21.246 --> 36:24.381
Oh, my God.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.386
Would you just...
God.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.412
Hey, hey, look for a clock
that only has a minute hand.

36:45.436 --> 36:49.583
Why?
Just fucking do it, Anderson.

36:49.607 --> 36:52.886
Okay.
Here, got it.

36:52.910 --> 36:57.347
This clock only has
a minute hand.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.986
Okay.
What the hell is up with these clocks?

37:04.489 --> 37:06.033
Here, here, here.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.602
All right, what the fuck?

37:11.062 --> 37:13.263
If I...

37:26.577 --> 37:27.510
Hm.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.484
That's impressive.
Very impressive.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.639
Here, help me.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.346
Ah?
Yes!

37:52.370 --> 37:55.683
Yeah! Hey, guys.

37:55.707 --> 37:56.984
You're my hero. Thank you.
Hey.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.219
You guys rescued us.

37:58.243 --> 38:00.654
Yeah, any longer and someone's
pants'd be on the floor.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.424
She's wearing a skirt.
That is correct.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.792
Oh, gross.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.429
What the fuck?

38:12.090 --> 38:13.657
Uh...

38:33.644 --> 38:35.556
Is that Christen?

38:35.580 --> 38:37.480
Oh, my God!

38:39.617 --> 38:41.495
Where is she?

38:41.519 --> 38:43.853
Yeah, things just got weird.

38:46.557 --> 38:47.801
Wow.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.359
What?

38:51.396 --> 38:54.108
It's all part of the game.

38:57.001 --> 39:01.148
This is fucking cool.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.451
Look, look. We have 41
minutes to rescue Christen.

39:04.475 --> 39:05.542
That's the game.

39:11.549 --> 39:12.726
Christen said we had an hour.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.561
Well, the timer must have
started when we got here.

39:14.585 --> 39:16.964
It was probably me. I flipped
the switch over there.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.488
Oh.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.469
Why isn't she in here with us?

39:22.493 --> 39:24.571
Why would she lock herself
in a cage somewhere?

39:24.595 --> 39:26.996
I don't know, Anderson. That's
what we have to figure out.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.447
Fine.
Whatever.

39:33.471 --> 39:36.016
At least we know what we're
playing for now, right?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.918
Bingo. That's
the can-do attitude

39:37.942 --> 39:39.086
we like to hear
from you, Anderson.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.188
Now, time is of the essence.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.457
So, it's a good thing I know
exactly what we have to do next.

39:43.481 --> 39:44.614
Check it out.

39:49.454 --> 39:50.898
What happened?

39:50.922 --> 39:52.133
What do you mean?

39:52.157 --> 39:53.834
Weren't there squares with
letters on them right here?

39:53.858 --> 39:55.702
Oh, yeah, there were.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.704
Yeah, but they were
there the whole time.

39:57.728 --> 39:58.972
Are you sure about that?

39:58.996 --> 40:00.307
'Cause you guys were just
sucking a whole bunch of face.

40:00.331 --> 40:04.778
Yeah, well, when was the last
time you two sucked face? Huh?

40:04.802 --> 40:06.547
Look, as soon as we
got out of the room,

40:06.571 --> 40:09.016
it must have disappeared.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.974
It's probably
the door. Huh?

40:16.581 --> 40:17.580
Hey.

40:19.116 --> 40:22.585
Wait!
Shut it again.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.937
Oh, wow, I bet you
have to spell something.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.873
Yeah, but what?

40:32.897 --> 40:34.831
There's got to be something.

40:37.735 --> 40:41.181
Oh, that...
What the fuck is that?

40:43.541 --> 40:44.651
Nice.

40:44.675 --> 40:46.920
Was that thing
strapped to your junk?

40:46.944 --> 40:48.121
It sure was.

40:48.145 --> 40:50.157
She released the Kraken.
Oh!

40:50.181 --> 40:53.527
Well, I'm not getting it.

40:53.551 --> 40:56.597
Getting what?
It's another card.

40:56.621 --> 40:59.633
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

40:59.657 --> 41:00.790
Fuck it.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.405
Ugh.

41:04.429 --> 41:06.540
Guys, come on. It was on
the outside of my pants.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.242
He's clean.
I would know.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.877
Excellent.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.012
Well, I don't see
any other clues here,

41:12.036 --> 41:15.015
so let's keep focused.

41:15.039 --> 41:18.685
Go. Go, go, go.
Yeah.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.567
Well, it obviously wants
us to spell something,

41:33.591 --> 41:35.569
so...
How big a word?

41:35.593 --> 41:38.995
Nine letters?
Nine letters? Fuck, big word.

41:41.832 --> 41:46.113
It's like an answer
to a crossword puzzle.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.504
Oh, you love crossword puzzles.

41:49.574 --> 41:50.974
He does.

41:53.578 --> 41:57.090
And the answer is
in one of these newspapers.

41:57.114 --> 41:58.047
Yes.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.664
We don't have time
to go through all of these.

42:03.688 --> 42:06.667
All right, some
of us look for crosswords

42:06.691 --> 42:07.668
while the others look for clues.

42:07.692 --> 42:08.902
You know, get a system going.

42:08.926 --> 42:09.970
That's gonna take forever.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.138
<i>There has to be
some kind of order.</i>

42:11.162 --> 42:14.097
<i>Oh, what if there's
a clue in a headline?</i>

42:16.100 --> 42:18.779
Well, theme in this one is dead
celebrities, if that helps.

42:18.803 --> 42:21.248
Well, did any of them
die on today's date?

42:21.272 --> 42:24.151
Maybe that's a fucking clue.

42:24.175 --> 42:26.153
The dates.

42:26.177 --> 42:27.844
That's actually not a bad idea.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.158
Nice, Christen.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.159
My birthday.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.695
Look for today's date 30 years ago.
Yes.

42:40.825 --> 42:42.725
This stack is all 1990s.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.973
'70s.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.374
Oh! I got the '80s.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.010
Perfect.
Yes!

42:50.034 --> 42:51.768
Okay...

42:55.673 --> 42:58.608
All right, who's got
October 13th?

43:07.818 --> 43:09.830
Ah, got it.

43:09.854 --> 43:10.920
Yes, right here.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.258
That's it.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.872
All right, it wants one word.

43:18.896 --> 43:20.774
All right, how many letters?
Nine.

43:20.798 --> 43:24.077
Nice.
All right, the clue is...

43:24.101 --> 43:26.636
"narcissistic notes."

43:28.873 --> 43:30.784
Interesting.

43:30.808 --> 43:32.308
I'm glad we got an easy one.

43:38.883 --> 43:41.194
All right, well,
uh, shut me in the room

43:41.218 --> 43:42.763
and I'll put in words
until I figure it out.

43:42.787 --> 43:43.731
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:43.755 --> 43:46.066
We started in there.
Let us take this one.

43:46.090 --> 43:47.734
Tyler.

43:47.758 --> 43:48.669
Conrad, this is gonna involve

43:48.693 --> 43:50.203
some quick problem-solving
on the fly

43:50.227 --> 43:52.139
and I'm not really sure
that's your forte.

43:52.163 --> 43:54.241
Whoa, whoa.

43:54.265 --> 43:56.443
What?

43:56.467 --> 43:58.735
You can let someone else
do something, Tyler.

44:00.738 --> 44:02.305
All right.

44:04.442 --> 44:05.819
All right.

44:05.843 --> 44:07.810
Oh! I got it.

44:09.346 --> 44:10.647
"Egomaniac."

44:14.385 --> 44:15.462
Actually, that could work.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.420
Yes.

44:29.300 --> 44:30.233
Well...

44:37.842 --> 44:39.953
Damn it.

44:39.977 --> 44:42.856
Narcissistic notes.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.793
Something about
letters... memos.

44:46.817 --> 44:47.828
Ego's memos.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.262
That has an apostrophe.

44:49.286 --> 44:52.722
So?
So it's definitely not the answer.

44:55.226 --> 44:59.406
Oh. What if note isn't to do
with something written?

44:59.430 --> 45:00.841
What'd you mean?

45:00.865 --> 45:03.110
Like a musical note?

45:03.134 --> 45:05.078
Like what is
a narcissistic's song?

45:05.102 --> 45:08.215
Oh, looks
like Anderson needs a hug.

45:08.239 --> 45:10.417
Oh, what about egotistic?

45:10.441 --> 45:11.418
Yeah, I'll try it.

45:11.442 --> 45:13.186
Oh!

45:13.210 --> 45:15.522
What is Carly Simon's
"You're So Vain"?

45:15.546 --> 45:17.157
That definitely won't fit.

45:17.181 --> 45:19.860
Also, this isn't <i>Jeopardy,</i> so...

45:19.884 --> 45:23.230
Well, you come up with
something, smart guy.

45:23.254 --> 45:25.198
Whatever it is,
it's your theme song.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.433
What did you say?
Huh?

45:26.457 --> 45:29.903
Nothing, just that my wife is
stuck up and she doesn't know...

45:29.927 --> 45:31.194
No, not that.
I love you.

45:36.233 --> 45:39.513
Try this.

45:39.537 --> 45:41.214
T.

45:41.238 --> 45:44.373
T? Okay, T.
Yes.

45:45.976 --> 45:49.156
H.
H.

45:49.180 --> 45:52.325
E.
E.

45:52.349 --> 45:56.285
M. E.

46:01.525 --> 46:02.759
Theme song.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.394
Theme song.
A-B-C-D-E-F...

46:13.871 --> 46:15.582
Yes!

46:15.606 --> 46:17.551
Yes!

46:17.575 --> 46:19.419
Yes!

46:19.443 --> 46:20.854
<i>Ha!</i>

46:23.581 --> 46:26.516
Nice. I'll go
let 'em out.

46:31.488 --> 46:34.835
If they <i> want</i> to get out.
I'll never get used to that.

46:34.859 --> 46:37.304
Oh, who's the protective
big brother?

46:37.328 --> 46:38.461
Stop.

46:40.164 --> 46:42.565
I love how when you pretend
to have a conscience...

46:44.101 --> 46:46.947
I said fucking stop! What
the fuck is wrong with you?

47:08.459 --> 47:10.860
Hey! Fuck!

47:20.070 --> 47:21.448
What's wrong?

47:21.472 --> 47:23.183
The key broke off
in the fucking door.

47:23.207 --> 47:24.118
What do you mean it broke?

47:24.142 --> 47:27.621
I tried to open it
and it wouldn't open.

47:27.645 --> 47:30.457
Damn it.
You disappoint me.

47:30.481 --> 47:33.126
Really, Anderson?
Jesus.

47:33.150 --> 47:34.383
I don't see...

47:36.020 --> 47:37.931
That's a little much.

47:37.955 --> 47:41.668
<i>Whoa! So fancy.</i>

47:52.069 --> 47:52.946
You're gonna have to sit tight

47:52.970 --> 47:55.982
'til we can figure
how to get you out.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.247
Wait.

48:08.719 --> 48:09.986
What's that?

48:22.967 --> 48:25.011
It's all part
of the game, right?

48:25.035 --> 48:27.480
Yeah. That's weird.

48:27.504 --> 48:28.681
What?

48:28.705 --> 48:31.685
We solved the puzzle. Why
would the door close again?

48:31.709 --> 48:32.686
Well, maybe...

48:32.710 --> 48:37.724
Maybe there's something else
that we have to do?

48:37.748 --> 48:39.448
That doesn't make sense.

48:43.153 --> 48:45.231
Wait.

48:48.592 --> 48:49.959
Something's wrong.

48:58.435 --> 48:59.535
What is that?

49:04.441 --> 49:06.976
It looks like it's burning them.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.249
Like... acid.

49:18.555 --> 49:20.166
Oh, my God!

49:20.190 --> 49:21.768
Oh!

49:21.792 --> 49:24.037
Tabby! Tabby!

49:27.398 --> 49:30.377
Holy shit!
What the fuck is happening to them?

49:30.401 --> 49:34.280
Tabby! No!
Oh, shit...

49:45.582 --> 49:46.726
Tabby!

49:50.054 --> 49:51.064
Ah!
Fuck!

49:51.088 --> 49:53.233
Damn it!

49:53.257 --> 49:55.535
What is happening?
Tabby!

49:57.661 --> 50:00.173
Something's happening to them!

50:00.197 --> 50:02.108
No!
Oh, my God!

50:02.132 --> 50:02.876
Tabby!
Oh, my God!

50:02.900 --> 50:06.112
Tabby!

50:06.136 --> 50:08.615
Get down!
Get on the floor!

50:08.639 --> 50:11.284
Oh, my God!

50:11.308 --> 50:13.186
Tabby!
Oh, shit!

50:13.210 --> 50:15.355
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Fuck! Fuck!

50:15.379 --> 50:16.312
Oh, my God...

50:21.218 --> 50:23.063
Holy shit.
Tabby!

50:23.087 --> 50:25.198
Conrad!
What the fuck is going on?

50:25.222 --> 50:26.099
Oh, my God!
Tabby!

50:26.123 --> 50:27.556
What is this?
What is this?

50:29.293 --> 50:31.438
Tabby? Tabby!

50:31.462 --> 50:35.775
Oh, my...
Oh, my God!

50:35.799 --> 50:39.312
Fuck!
Fuck!

50:47.878 --> 50:49.289
Fuck.

51:13.203 --> 51:16.182
What the fuck is this place?

52:07.191 --> 52:08.891
No.

52:13.197 --> 52:14.730
What did you do?

52:17.734 --> 52:19.168
I didn't...

52:22.372 --> 52:23.772
I didn't do anything.

52:26.376 --> 52:28.521
It locked on its own!

52:28.545 --> 52:30.290
I-I-I tried to open it.

52:30.314 --> 52:33.193
No, you fucked it up
and look what happened.

52:33.217 --> 52:36.329
You couldn't do anything!
I tried to help them!

52:36.353 --> 52:37.453
Look at you!

52:40.357 --> 52:42.324
I tried to help them.

53:10.487 --> 53:11.787
No.

53:16.393 --> 53:17.960
Don't hurt her.

53:29.806 --> 53:31.307
No.

53:39.816 --> 53:41.617
It's real.

53:42.986 --> 53:45.832
It's all real.
Real?

53:45.856 --> 53:49.625
What are you talking about?
Of c... of course...

53:51.495 --> 53:54.374
Why would Christen
bring us here?

53:54.398 --> 53:55.775
Christen's in trouble, too.

53:55.799 --> 53:57.977
Then why the fuck isn't
she in the room with us?

53:58.001 --> 54:00.502
She's locked in a
fucking cage, Anderson!

54:01.905 --> 54:03.005
Christ.

54:06.343 --> 54:09.455
It's not a game.

54:09.479 --> 54:10.613
We have to get out of here.

54:12.582 --> 54:13.993
Help me!

54:14.017 --> 54:14.950
Fuck!

54:21.491 --> 54:25.672
Fuck! Fuck!
There's no way!

54:25.696 --> 54:27.440
What? So...
So we're trapped?

54:27.464 --> 54:29.509
There's no puzzle
to get us out of here?

54:29.533 --> 54:31.600
Fuck these puzzles!

54:44.681 --> 54:46.915
All these rooms are enclosed.

54:48.618 --> 54:51.464
Yeah. We figured that out
a long time ago.

54:51.488 --> 54:54.290
What are you getting at? Which means
there must be some sort of ventilation.

55:08.872 --> 55:10.072
Here!

55:12.509 --> 55:14.721
Fuck.
I'm here.

55:14.745 --> 55:16.378
Take this.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.369
We have to go.

55:29.393 --> 55:32.361
No way.
No fucking way!

55:33.563 --> 55:34.707
Do you want to get out of here?

55:34.731 --> 55:36.442
Did you see what just
happened to Conrad and Tabby?

55:36.466 --> 55:37.844
There's got to be another
way to open up the door.

55:37.868 --> 55:39.879
Do you really want to wait
around and figure it out?

55:39.903 --> 55:41.514
What if there is
no way to open the door?

55:41.538 --> 55:42.649
What if it's
just a matter of time

55:42.673 --> 55:44.817
until this entire place
fills up with more acid fog

55:44.841 --> 55:46.419
and we fucking fry, Anderson?

55:46.443 --> 55:47.843
I'm going.

55:50.514 --> 55:53.726
What?
I'm going.

55:53.750 --> 55:55.351
We're going.

56:10.834 --> 56:13.502
Tash.
I got... I gotta go.

56:21.511 --> 56:26.548
Okay. Okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.

56:36.226 --> 56:39.439
The vent turns.

56:39.463 --> 56:41.541
Just keep moving.

56:41.565 --> 56:45.945
I'm coming!
I'm right behind you.

56:45.969 --> 56:49.015
Anderson!
Fuck!

57:07.624 --> 57:09.035
There's something up ahead.

57:09.059 --> 57:10.703
Like it could be an opening.

57:23.039 --> 57:24.807
Anderson.

57:32.048 --> 57:33.626
What?

57:33.650 --> 57:35.127
It's another fucking puzzle.

57:44.561 --> 57:46.739
Fuck is with this shit?!

57:46.763 --> 57:48.574
Let's just go back!

57:48.598 --> 57:50.776
No! There's a puzzle, we'll solve
it, we'll get out of here.

57:50.800 --> 57:53.646
Get out of my way!
Shit!

57:53.670 --> 57:56.082
Jesus!

57:56.106 --> 57:57.583
Fuck!

57:57.607 --> 57:59.785
Shit!

57:59.809 --> 58:01.587
It's fine, we're getting out.
We just gotta...

58:01.611 --> 58:02.989
We gotta...

58:03.013 --> 58:04.991
I don't understand this.

58:05.015 --> 58:07.660
Okay. Maybe it's...

58:07.684 --> 58:09.795
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

58:09.819 --> 58:11.264
Shit.
Why the fuck...

58:11.288 --> 58:13.933
God damn it, Natasha!
I didn't know!

58:13.957 --> 58:15.701
Fuck!
Move!

58:15.725 --> 58:17.603
Help... Let me see it! Let me see it!
Fuck!

58:17.627 --> 58:19.238
Shut up! Fuck.
Fuck.

58:19.262 --> 58:20.339
Move!
No!

58:20.363 --> 58:22.708
Fuck!
Just let me see it. I can do this.

58:22.732 --> 58:24.644
No, shut up!
Tyler!

58:24.668 --> 58:26.279
Fuck!
Move, he's good at these things.

58:26.303 --> 58:28.548
Fuck.

58:28.572 --> 58:30.038
It's the Greek riddle
of the Sphinx.

58:31.808 --> 58:33.553
Well, then answer it.
Hang on!

58:38.882 --> 58:41.193
Did you hear that?
What?

58:41.217 --> 58:42.695
What?
Just, shh!

58:42.719 --> 58:45.821
Just listen.
You hear it?

58:49.292 --> 58:50.659
Yeah, I hear it.

58:53.029 --> 58:54.240
Oh, my God, it's getting louder.

58:54.264 --> 58:55.808
Anderson!
It's getting louder!

58:55.832 --> 58:57.076
Anderson!
Okay, okay, okay.

58:57.100 --> 59:00.112
Um, find a sun.
Okay.

59:00.136 --> 59:02.682
Put it next to the sunrise.

59:02.706 --> 59:03.550
Good, good. Next.

59:03.574 --> 59:05.607
Now find a star
and put it next to that.

59:08.044 --> 59:09.021
Yes!
All right.

59:09.045 --> 59:10.056
Next one, next one. Come on!

59:10.080 --> 59:11.091
An infant.
What?

59:11.115 --> 59:13.593
A baby! A fucking baby!
Okay, where?

59:13.617 --> 59:14.927
Put it next to that.

59:14.951 --> 59:16.963
Okay. Next.
Next one, come on!

59:16.987 --> 59:18.965
All right.
Hurry! Just hurry!

59:18.989 --> 59:21.934
An old man!
Here, here, here!

59:23.727 --> 59:24.660
Fuck.

59:25.729 --> 59:26.740
Fuck!
What?

59:26.764 --> 59:29.609
What the? Something just
shut the duct behind me.

59:29.633 --> 59:31.744
Are you okay?
No! What the fuck is it?

59:31.768 --> 59:34.013
Oh, my God!

59:34.037 --> 59:37.683
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Come on!

59:37.707 --> 59:39.151
My leg is stuck.
Go!

59:39.175 --> 59:41.821
My leg is stuck!
My leg is stuck!

59:41.845 --> 59:44.724
Help me! Help me!
Oh, my God! Help!

59:44.748 --> 59:46.682
Oh, my God!

59:48.718 --> 59:50.029
No.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:19.381
Here!

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.820
No...

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:29.001
No!

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.824
Are you fucking serious?

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.437
Anderson!

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:06.138
Anderson, come on!

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.963
He's not coming.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.283
<i>We're gonna die in here.</i>

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:20.853
We're gonna die in here.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:22.177
We're gonna die.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:35.401
He knew.

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.203
What?

01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:40.439
Anderson knew.
He had to know.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:45.478
I wanted him to know.

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:47.813
I wanted him to get mad at me.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:49.882
I wanted to <i> feel</i> something.

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:52.207
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:58.524
He never said anything.

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.030
Hey!

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.355
Pull your shit together!

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:20.146
Oh, my God.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.883
Oh... oh, oh!

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.519
Oh, my God!

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.255
Why are all these wires
coming out of the TVs?

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.856
Tyler.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.558
These. They're
primary colors.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.827
It's gotta be another
fucking puzzle, right?

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.051
I mean, look at them.

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.298
Yes.

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.901
Yellow and red make orange.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:47.473
And blue and yellow make green.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.542
And green and orange are left.

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:51.811
It has to be. Yes.

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:03.889
No!

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:09.829
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.866
Fuck.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.367
What do we do?
I don't know.

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.858
What the fuck do we do?
I don't know!

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.505
It's all part of the game,
Tyler.

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:20.573
You always know the answer.

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:24.009
What the fuck do we do?
I said I don't know!

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:27.012
Exactly.
You <i> don't</i> know.

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.614
You think you're so
fucking perfect, Tyler.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.749
Shut up.

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:31.483
You think Christen didn't see
through your bullshit,

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:33.552
that everyone didn't know
what you were doing.

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:35.977
Shut the fuck up!

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:39.514
She knew.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.467
"Teddy Bear Picnic."
What?

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:53.495
Only Christen would know
that I <i> fucking</i> hate that song.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.276
Oh, fuck.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.424
Fuck!

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.855
We only have three minutes.
Shut up!

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:27.973
I feel something.
There's a handle.

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.646
Thank God.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.918
Oh.
Fuck, fuck!

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.020
It locked again.
Shit!

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:49.128
Yes!

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:53.054
Oh, shit!

01:04:57.593 --> 01:05:00.005
Fuck!

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.230
Fuck! Fuck!

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:07.513
What?
The door's too heavy, I can't open it.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:09.581
Come do this.

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:11.673
I'll open the goddamned door.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:16.912
Okay.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:23.495
I think I feel something.

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:24.997
Do it!

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:33.372
What happened?

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:39.111
The mouth
started closing on my arm.

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.280
You hold it,
I'll hold the door open,

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:43.415
and when I say "go," you run.

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:46.685
There's no time to waste,
Natasha!

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.655
Okay, okay!
Jesus.

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:53.548
Now!

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.379
It's closing! It's closing!

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:15.447
It's closing, Tyler!
It's closing!

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.516
Just a little bit more!
It's closing on my arm!

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.120
It's closing on my arm, Tyler!

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.255
Oh, it's closing!

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.623
Just a little more.

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:28.527
Oh, my God! Hurry!

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:32.197
It's cutting my arm, Tyler!

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:34.166
Stop, Tyler!
It's gonna break my arm.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.334
Stop opening it!

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.368
It's closing, it's closing!

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.636
I'm sorry.

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.773
Fuck!

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:28.454
Fuck!

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.651
Christen.

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:02.154
Can you hear me?
<i>Yes.</i>

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:05.213
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:09.495
I'm fine.
<i>Okay.</i>

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:11.486
What is this, Christen?

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:14.756
<i>What?</i>

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.403
What is this?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:19.770
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:22.174
Why did you bring us here?

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.274
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:25.877
Why did you bring us here?

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:28.447
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.171
<i>I didn't know. I wasn't...</i>

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.856
Have you been watching
this whole time?

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.892
<i>Tyler..</i>

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.225
Saw them all die?

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.283
Is that your fucking idea?

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.453
Did you plan that?

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.301
They're all dead because of you.

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:52.237
<i>I... How could you say that?</i>

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.473
<i>Don't, Tyler. It's...</i>

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.341
<i>How could you say that?</i>

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:58.810
My sister is dead.
My sister is dead!

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:02.670
<i>Because of you.
Is this some sort of sick joke?</i>

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.274
No.
<i>Tell me.</i>

01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:13.192
<i>Tyler.</i>
Oh, oh.

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:15.426
So I assume you had... you had
nothing to do with this?

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.496
<i>No! I woke up in this cage.</i>

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.298
I don't fucking believe you,
Christen.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:22.334
I just want this to be over.

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:24.502
You think I can't tell
when you're lying to me?

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.205
I didn't do anything.
I'm so... I'm so...

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:30.341
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I-I can't hear you, Christen.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:33.245
You know, because I can't hear
anything over fucking lies!

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.680
Tyler, what's happening?
You're lying!

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.804
Believe me!
There's no time, Christen.

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:40.886
Tyler!
No! Say it!

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.854
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:44.555
Why did you
fucking bring us here?

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.247
There's no time, Christen!
Say it!

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.350
Say it!

01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:54.466
Say it!

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.968
Now! Say it!

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:58.237
Tyler!

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:08.937
Oh... No!

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:19.258
No!

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:31.303
<i>I don't know how to get to you.</i>

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:34.473
Tyler.
What do I do?

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:35.807
What do I have to do?

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.543
<i>I love you.</i>

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.634
<i>911, state your emergency?</i>

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.115
Yes...

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.149
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:33.552
I was... I was taken.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:36.555
My friends... I-I-I think
they were, um...

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:38.790
I don't know where they are.
<i>Okay, Ma'am, Ma'am?</i>

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.659
I think they were maybe...
<i>I need you to slow down.</i>

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:43.595
Can't tell where I am.
<i>Take a deep breath for me.</i>

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.664
<i>Okay, I show
you're on the corner</i>

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:48.900
<i>of Central and East Third
Avenue.</i>

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.236
<i>I'm sending a patrol car
now to help you.</i>

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.538
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
<i>Okay?</i>

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.207
<i>I need you to stay on the line
with me, all right?</i>

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.509
<i>Can you do that?</i>
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.545
<i>Okay, what is your name?</i>

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:02.981
Christen Wills.

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:05.039
<i>And what happened, Christen?</i>

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:09.187
We went to an escape room.

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:12.224
It was my boyfriend's birthday,
and um...

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:13.592
<i>Hello?</i>

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:27.072
<i>Tyler was right.</i>

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:29.074
<i>They're all dead because of you.</i>

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.146
Who is this?

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.250
Why?

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:42.954
<i>Oh, no. Who I am is not
important at all.</i>

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:46.658
<i>No, but why... That</i> is.

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:48.560
What do you mean?

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:52.030
<i>You went looking for this.</i>

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.999
<i>Remember?</i>

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.524
<i>You do</i> not <i> hang up on me.</i>

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:59.638
<i>Don't do it.</i>

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.736
Hi, there.

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.574
I'm watching you.

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:24.663
<i>You found exactly what you were
looking for, didn't you?</i>

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:27.232
<i>A night of escape.</i>

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:29.000
<i>I let you watch.</i>

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:34.339
<i>You have one hour.</i>

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:40.712
<i>The police are coming.</i>

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:45.650
Listen, when the cops get there,
just do me a favor.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:49.821
I want you to tell 'em
everything,

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:55.627
but if you and I are being
honest with each other?

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:02.734
<i>I gotta tell ya, I doubt
they're gonna believe you.</i>

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.297
<i>You really can't help
yourselves, can you?</i>

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.778
<i>You people are so naïve.</i>

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:16.014
<i>It's all part of the game,
remember?</i>

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:19.050
Who are you?
What did you do?

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.688
You should ask yourself this,
Christen.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:29.160
<i>Who really escapes?</i>

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.151
<i>Was it you?</i>

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.733
<i>Or was it them?</i>

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:48.313
<i>Stay on the line.</i>

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:51.683
<i>Christen, can you hear me?</i>

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:54.319
<i>Ma'am, I need you to say
something if you can hear me.</i>

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:57.456
<i>Units are almost there.</i>

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.924
<i>If you can hear me,
you are going to be okay.</i>

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.961
<i>Stay with me, Christen.</i>

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.251
<i>Stay with me.</i>
