-Should you get that?
-Ah! I'm sorry!

09:57.639 --> 09:59.516
Can you just, like, hold on...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, be you.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.435
-Okay. [sighs]
-[ringing continues]

10:03.770 --> 10:05.689
-Hey. No, no, no, no, no, Mom,

10:05.772 --> 10:07.524
don't worry, don't worry,
it's fine. What's up?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.568
-MOTHER: [indistinct]

10:09.651 --> 10:10.819
-LEAH: Listen, you'll be fine,
Mom, okay?

10:10.902 --> 10:12.321
I can't come in,
I can't right now,

10:12.404 --> 10:13.739
but, um, but everything's
gonna be fine.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.450
You're gonna be fine,
I promise.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.493
Okay.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.078
I love you.
I love you so much.

10:20.162 --> 10:23.540
Mom, I lo...
Um, Mom, um...

10:23.623 --> 10:25.917
I just want to let you know
that work's going really good.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.211
Like, I'm... I've had some
really exciting

10:28.295 --> 10:29.796
developments in my project.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.508
Yeah. So, um...

10:34.926 --> 10:38.138
So I just... I'm gonna be
pretty busy tonight,

10:38.221 --> 10:39.890
so if you try to get in touch
with me and you can't,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.309
it's just... I... I just
want you to know that I'm okay.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.894
Okay? Like,
everything's fine.

10:43.977 --> 10:44.978
-Um...
-MOTHER: [indistinct]

10:45.062 --> 10:46.396
Hey, what was that, Ma?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.522
-MOTHER: [indistinct]

10:53.278 --> 10:55.280
-I... I... Okay.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.741
Um... all right,
get some rest, Ma.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.909
I love you.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.668
[chuckles]

11:08.752 --> 11:09.795
Hey.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.965
So, like, what's it like?

11:14.049 --> 11:15.675
-Are you okay?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.344
-Yeah! Oh, yeah,
I'm fine. Sure.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.221
But, like, what's it like
where you are?

11:19.304 --> 11:20.806
Sorry, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.432
-I can't... Yeah, I mean...
-Butterfly Effect.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.018
I can't know 'til
I get there, so, um...

11:25.102 --> 11:26.311
Let's do this.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.106
-LEAH 2: Like...
Like right now?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.024
-Yeah. Yeah, like, right now.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.401
I've only been searching
for you for five years.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.069
-LEAH 2: Don't you want to,
like...

11:34.152 --> 11:38.240
pee first or tell Mom?
I mean, like really tell her?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.576
-What?

11:41.660 --> 11:43.829
-Shouldn't you, like,
tell Mom? She'd be worried.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.540
I mean, I guess I...
I could tell her for you.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.835
I think. I don't know.
I hope she'd remember.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.003
-Uh, Leah?
-LEAH 2: Yeah.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.630
-Where are you?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.507
-In our basement.
-No, but I mean, like...

11:55.590 --> 11:58.635
like, when are you?
-2019.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.640
-I thought I was talking with
the future, not the past.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.184
I... I thought
you sounded happy.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.395
I thought that
we were in the future,

12:08.478 --> 12:12.524
and we were happy again,
but you... you're in 2019?

12:12.607 --> 12:16.319
You're not happy,
you're just dumb!

12:16.403 --> 12:19.281
-Excuse me?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.074
Leah. Girl.

12:21.158 --> 12:24.161
-Don't. Don't say girl.
It's just like... Ugh!

12:24.244 --> 12:26.246
[rattling]

12:28.206 --> 12:30.417
I need to get out of here.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.252
-LEAH 2: Yeah, come to 2019.
Oh, my God.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.087
We can have the craziest
30th birthday party,

12:34.171 --> 12:36.631
'cause I'm pretty sure 2020
is gonna be my year.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.260
-[screams]

12:40.343 --> 12:43.305
You are so naive!
You are so unaware.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.266
I mean, how long have you
even been trying to travel?

12:46.349 --> 12:48.059
Like, if it's 2019 and
you're in our basement lab,

12:48.143 --> 12:49.352
that means you've
been trying since...

12:49.436 --> 12:51.521
-This morning.
It's beginner's luck. Right?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.482
-[screams]

12:53.565 --> 12:56.318
-Rachel was right. We really
can be a lot sometimes.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.528
-Rachel is not right.
Rachel is never right!

12:58.612 --> 13:00.238
Do you understand?
-Um, I think I understand

13:00.322 --> 13:02.574
-a lot more than you do.
-You are 29!

13:02.657 --> 13:04.159
You are a child,
you're an infant,

13:04.242 --> 13:06.453
you're an embryo,
you're a fucking seed!

13:06.536 --> 13:09.498
-Wow. I did not anticipate
future me being such

13:09.581 --> 13:11.249
a condescending bitch.
-Tch, tch, tch!

13:11.333 --> 13:14.920
-Oh! Are you just gonna, like,
not talk to me now?

13:15.003 --> 13:16.004
Are you just gonna give me

13:16.087 --> 13:17.255
the interdimensional
silent treatment?

13:17.339 --> 13:19.925
Okay, that's cool, that's great.
Yeah, no, totally.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.719
-Okay, so, in order to run

13:22.802 --> 13:24.804
a reverse dimensional
location search,

13:24.888 --> 13:26.181
I need to know what

13:26.264 --> 13:28.391
the interdimensional VIN is
on your computer.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.019
-Oh, now you want me.
-Need, not want.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.729
-And why should I tell you?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.564
-Because I want to
communicate with the future.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.651
-Oh, well, I already am
communicating with the future,

13:37.734 --> 13:39.653
and she's a miserable old hag.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.447
-I am a very tired 34.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.493
You are... Oh, God. Fine!

13:46.576 --> 13:49.162
Leah, I will make you a trade.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.706
If you tell me the code,
I will tell you something,

13:51.790 --> 13:53.959
anything, about the future.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.085
-Fine.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.756
How does "Game of Thrones" end?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.676
-Seriously?
-You said any question

14:02.759 --> 14:04.010
I wanted, so I want...
-Not well.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.262
Leah, not well.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.264
Daenerys loses her shit,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.182
and just
a two-episodes-prior sane

14:09.266 --> 14:11.226
and brilliant young queen,

14:11.309 --> 14:14.813
and suddenly, a bloodthirsty,
pathetically convenient tyrant.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.440
Now... What is
the dimensional VIN?

14:19.234 --> 14:23.655
-3443.87

14:25.407 --> 14:27.200
-It's not working.
-That's weird.

14:27.284 --> 14:28.702
-Do not fuck with me
right now, Leah.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.036
Are you sure
you gave it to me correctly?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.746
-Um, I was a fucking
Fulbright Scholar, Leah.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.666
-So was I, Leah, and
it's not working, so...

14:34.749 --> 14:36.585
You know what? Fuck it.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.712
-What are you doing?
Leah, come on.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.505
Honestly, this is crazy.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.799
Like, why do you even want to
travel to the future anyway?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.050
[beeping]

14:44.134 --> 14:45.885
-Leah...
-You need to stop talking.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.721
-No, no, no, no, no,
don't touch that!

14:47.804 --> 14:49.806
Just... Just, like... Ugh!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.308
Can you just be happy
where you are?

14:51.391 --> 14:54.144
Leah. Leah! Stop!

14:57.772 --> 14:59.190
-Ah! [grunts]

-Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Hi!

15:05.113 --> 15:08.491
Yes! Yes! This is...
This is you.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.327
I mean, this is me,
this is Leah from the past.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.453
It is a privilege
to meet you.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.496
Let me video you in.
Hold on.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.833
-LEAH 3: Oh, my God.
Oh my God!

15:16.916 --> 15:18.043
Oh, my God.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.589
I did it! That was even easier
than, like, "13 Going On 30"!

15:22.672 --> 15:26.176
-Um...
-No. No!

15:26.259 --> 15:27.886
-Oh, my God.
-No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

15:27.969 --> 15:31.264
Leah, when are you calling from?
-2019.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.724
-But that's impossible.
I moved just 10 years in

15:32.807 --> 15:34.184
the opposite direction
of Past Leah,

15:34.267 --> 15:35.894
so... [stammers]
if you're also 2019,

15:35.977 --> 15:37.020
then that means that you're...

15:43.526 --> 15:44.819
-The future.

15:45.779 --> 15:46.780
-It's you.

-LEAH 2: Hi, Leah.
-LEAH 3: Hey, girl!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.955
-LEAH 2: Don't say girl.
It's just...

15:56.039 --> 15:59.376
-Why? Why would you
pretend to...

15:59.459 --> 16:00.877
-LEAH 2: I had to.
-Why?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.421
-LEAH 2: To stop you.
-To stop me? From what?

16:03.505 --> 16:05.006
-Coming here.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.425
-How are we not documenting
this? -How interesting.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.094
I don't... I don't... When...

16:09.177 --> 16:11.179
-2029, five years
in your future.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.223
-Uh, why do you look
younger than her?

16:13.306 --> 16:17.435
-In the future,
we are very... rich,

16:17.519 --> 16:20.605
and, um... I read somewhere
that Karl Lagerfeld

16:20.689 --> 16:21.981
had a facialist
come over every night

16:22.065 --> 16:23.149
to drain his lymph, so...

16:23.233 --> 16:25.860
-Okay, okay, can we all
just focus, please?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.070
Leah.
-Yes?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.697
-O-Only future Leah.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.325
Please...
-Leah...

16:32.409 --> 16:35.161
I'm begging you. You've got to
get me out of here.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.831
-Leah, stop. Just stop.
-But...

16:37.914 --> 16:40.041
Just...
No, it wouldn't be fair.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.919
-Fair? Fair, fuck you.
Fuck you!

16:43.002 --> 16:44.629
Give me the algorithm.
-It doesn't work like that.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.880
-Could you just tell me
how to get out of here?

16:45.964 --> 16:47.632
-Why?

16:47.716 --> 16:49.426
Why do you want to
travel to the future, Leah?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.302
-Well, first of all,
fuckin' Marchek.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.555
-Just Past Leah.
-That's me.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.849
-Just 2024 Leah.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.142
-For my research.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.060
So I can prove Marchek wrong.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.603
-LEAH 3: Right?
-LEAH 2: Tell me why.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.689
-So I can be the first.
The first to do it, the...

17:02.772 --> 17:05.734
the maverick, the pioneer.
-Bullshit.

17:05.817 --> 17:06.818
-Because I want to watch
the fucking

17:06.901 --> 17:07.944
"Game of Thrones" prequel.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.196
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
There's gonna be a prequel?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.532
-Tell me why.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.456
-She doesn't need to know.
-LEAH 3: Know what?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.040
-LEAH 2: Leah.
-No.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.709
-Once we take it from her,
-LEAH 3: Excuse me.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.461
-It's gone. And no matter how
far back she travels...

17:24.544 --> 17:25.962
-She will always know
that it's coming.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.424
-There's no play here, Leah.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.885
I need you to tell me why you
want to travel to the future,

17:31.968 --> 17:34.012
and I need the truth.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.815
-I'm so sorry. Um...

17:48.485 --> 17:52.781
I want to travel to
the future...

17:52.864 --> 17:54.866
so that I can find a cure.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.117
-A cure for what?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.121
-For Mom.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.915
Um, she gets sick.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.210
-Why? What's, uh...
What's wrong with her?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.336
What's gonna be wrong
with her?

18:10.632 --> 18:11.758
-ALS.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.802
-What? No.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.220
-She's gonna fall off her bike
-No.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.473
-in summer, July, a couple of
years from now for you.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.599
Um...

18:22.477 --> 18:25.230
It's bad.

18:25.313 --> 18:28.608
You move home,
you drop out of school,

18:28.691 --> 18:30.318
Carl will dump you over it,

18:30.401 --> 18:32.237
and it just...

18:32.320 --> 18:35.031
You care for her
night and day.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.658
Night and day,
night and day,

18:36.741 --> 18:38.326
and it just gets
worse and worse.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.789
-LEAH 3: Is she in pain?

18:53.216 --> 18:56.052
-Here I am.
You happy now?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.762
-Why do you want to
travel to the future, Leah?

18:57.846 --> 18:59.264
-I just told you.
-Just told you.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.765
-Why are you so sure

19:00.849 --> 19:03.142
that there's a cure for ALS
in only five years?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.228
Why not travel 10 years ahead
or 20 or 100?

19:05.311 --> 19:06.521
-I don't know, I just...
-LEAH 2: No?

19:06.604 --> 19:08.439
-I just assumed that in
five years there would be...

19:08.523 --> 19:10.233
-LEAH 3: What is she
talking about? Why is she...

19:10.316 --> 19:12.318
-I don't know,
she's acting crazy.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.112
-You are a terrible liar.
Mom always said so.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.697
-Don't even speak about her.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.073
-Why do you want to travel

19:17.156 --> 19:18.783
-to the future, Leah?
-I told you.

19:18.867 --> 19:19.993
-What was
the doctor's prognosis?

19:20.076 --> 19:21.911
-Don't you... I told you...
-Say it. Why, Leah?

19:21.995 --> 19:24.372
Why do you want to journey
the space time continuum

19:24.455 --> 19:26.249
and land five years
in the future?

19:26.332 --> 19:28.793
-Because I need her
to be gone!

19:28.877 --> 19:32.088
Because I need it
to be finished!

19:32.171 --> 19:33.214
Okay?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.221
Five years.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.764
Five years,
that's her prognosis, okay?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.308
Five years,
they give her five years,

19:43.391 --> 19:46.978
but the thing is,
every day feels like a year.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.689
And there have been
so many days and...

19:49.772 --> 19:51.900
tests and surgeries
and last rites,

19:51.983 --> 19:55.653
there have been so many
last rites and so little mercy.

19:57.864 --> 20:02.660
And so much loss of movement
and memory in her,

20:02.744 --> 20:05.246
and the slurred speech and
the only Leah understands,

20:05.330 --> 20:07.457
only Leah does it right,
she only wants Leah,

20:07.540 --> 20:10.043
only Leah can...

20:10.126 --> 20:12.003
[sobbing]

20:17.050 --> 20:19.594
I love her so much
and I need it to be done.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.099
She's right.
I'm lying.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.937
By the time Mom
gets her diagnosis,

20:29.020 --> 20:30.772
it's too late for a cure.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.149
-And because of
the Butterfly Effect,

20:33.232 --> 20:37.111
you can't change that without
destroying everything else.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.284
-The truth is...

20:46.245 --> 20:47.288
horrible.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.833
Necessary truth...

20:53.962 --> 20:56.839
is that I need her to be
a thing of the past

20:56.923 --> 20:58.841
so that I can be
a thing of the future.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.392
Is that what you wanted?

21:09.352 --> 21:10.645
You happy now?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.147
-Nothing about this
makes me happy.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.112
[rattling]

21:23.574 --> 21:24.742
-[sniffles]

21:26.911 --> 21:30.415
This was you reaching out
to me, wasn't it?

21:30.498 --> 21:32.208
-LEAH 2: Yeah.
-Why?

21:32.291 --> 21:35.211
-LEAH 2: Because
you need to accept...

21:35.294 --> 21:37.296
you can't fix it.

21:39.882 --> 21:40.967
-No.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.511
-LEAH 2: Leah,

21:43.594 --> 21:47.056
there is nothing you can do
to escape this.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.517
I know because I tried.
I jumped and...

21:49.600 --> 21:51.144
and I won
the Nobel Prize,

21:51.227 --> 21:52.729
and I'm Time's
Person of the Century,

21:52.812 --> 21:53.896
and I'm friends with
Mark Ruffalo,

21:53.980 --> 21:54.939
-and...
-Wait, really?

21:55.023 --> 21:57.984
-LEAH 2:
But none of it matters.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.402
I left her...

22:00.987 --> 22:05.366
I left her in that
beige hospital room to die.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.411
I did what you want to do,
I came here,

22:08.494 --> 22:09.662
and now I'm nowhere.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.456
And it would be
the same for you.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.166
You'd leave and and
you'd still feel the weight,

22:13.249 --> 22:15.126
the heaviness of having made
the choice to survive,

22:15.209 --> 22:17.795
and you'd realize
far too late

22:17.879 --> 22:20.506
the gift that you had
with her every day.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.550
Every day is a year.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.260
Every day with her,
time stands still,

22:24.343 --> 22:25.595
and you won't be able to
live with yourself

22:25.678 --> 22:28.264
for ever having wanted it
to speed up.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.390
Leah!

22:30.933 --> 22:33.227
The reason I am here now...

22:33.311 --> 22:36.397
is because
I need you to stay.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.318
And I need you to
forgive me for going.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.321
I can't fix... I mean...
[clears throat]

22:43.404 --> 22:48.826
I get why I left,
but I can't seem to...

22:50.536 --> 22:52.080
let go.

22:53.456 --> 22:57.919
And I thought if you can
forgive me,

22:58.002 --> 23:01.130
forgive us for leaving,

23:01.214 --> 23:05.635
then I can live
and you can just...

23:05.718 --> 23:07.845
stop and, like,
just be there,

23:07.929 --> 23:10.890
just... just... just be with her
like I couldn't, Leah.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.855
-I really didn't... solve it?

23:20.066 --> 23:24.779
-No. I didn't use
the Cauchy Horizon.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.197
-Okay.

23:30.701 --> 23:31.744
Okay.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.671
I, uh...

23:41.754 --> 23:43.589
Of course, I forgive you.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.812
-Thank you.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.856
[electronic bleeps]

24:02.942 --> 24:05.695
-What's that?
-I didn't touch anything.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.822
-You solved time travel
your way,

24:07.905 --> 24:09.448
and I'll solve it mine.

24:09.532 --> 24:12.326
The Cauchy Horizon works.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.452
-No.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.746
-Baby Leah...
-I don't love that name.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.583
-Dimensional VIN is 4.5514.
-Leah, what are you doing?

24:18.666 --> 24:19.917
-Wait, what?
-You input that into

24:20.001 --> 24:21.836
the computer, okay? And then you
travel as far into the future

24:21.919 --> 24:23.296
as you need to until
-Leah, no, no, no, no, no!

24:23.379 --> 24:24.922
-there's a cure for Mom.
-Stop, stop, stop.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.465
-Don't listen to her,
listen to me.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.217
-The Butterfly Effect.
-You can still save her

24:28.301 --> 24:29.719
in your timeline.
You find the cure.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.554
-If you save someone
who is meant to die...

24:31.637 --> 24:34.265
-All other timelines will cease.
You will destroy both of us.

24:34.348 --> 24:35.892
-You find it
and you travel back

24:35.975 --> 24:37.435
to July, 2019,
before she gets sick,

24:37.518 --> 24:40.354
and you give it to her, and...
and you solve time travel,

24:40.438 --> 24:41.564
and become famous and wealthy...
-She will live

24:41.647 --> 24:42.940
and the two of us
will disappear.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.525
-We're gone!
-You live a happy life.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.194
Do you understand?
A good life.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.654
A life without pain
or regret with Mom.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.574
-Leah, I c... I am not ready.
I... I... No, I...

24:51.657 --> 24:55.536
-And you never will be.
But it's time.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.083
[breathes deeply]

25:03.336 --> 25:05.713
-LEAH 2: No, you can't.
Don't... No. No!

25:08.132 --> 25:10.218
You fucking traitor!

25:11.510 --> 25:12.803
-Can you hear me now?

25:12.887 --> 25:14.555
-Why are you doing this? Why?

25:18.768 --> 25:20.728
-I can't leave Mom
in that beige room

25:20.811 --> 25:25.107
with no hope and no us,
and I can't make Mom and us

25:25.191 --> 25:27.735
go through all that pain
again and again and again,

25:27.818 --> 25:32.782
so... we gotta make way for
a new future.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.242
-No, no, no.
Listen, Leah, Leah, Leah,

25:34.325 --> 25:35.534
listen to me,
listen to me.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.829
Mom, she wouldn't want us to
sacrifice our lives for her.

25:38.913 --> 25:42.083
-I know. Wasn't she the best?
-No, no, no, no, no.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.335
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die, Leah.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.629
-Well, you've still got time.
I'd get to work, though.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.964
You're smarter but...

25:48.047 --> 25:49.674
-No, Leah, Leah...
-...Leah's younger.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.800
-Stop...

26:02.853 --> 26:04.021

-Hey, Ma.
-MOTHER: [indistinct]

26:16.617 --> 26:18.828
Yeah, yeah, I'm great.
I'm, uh...

26:20.830 --> 26:23.666
I, um... I just had to call
'cause, uh...

26:25.126 --> 26:28.087
It's so small,

26:28.170 --> 26:30.715
but, um...

26:30.798 --> 26:33.092
do you remember that night
during Hurricane Felix?

26:33.175 --> 26:37.096
I was like five, and, um...

26:37.179 --> 26:38.639
you got me and Rachel
out of bed,

26:38.723 --> 26:42.518
and you carried us
down to the basement, and...

26:42.601 --> 26:45.604
and, uh... it's just...

26:45.688 --> 26:50.359
Sorry, I just... I remember that
the... the wind got really...

26:50.443 --> 26:51.736
loud.

26:51.819 --> 26:54.280
And the thunder started,
and Rachel was asleep,

26:54.363 --> 26:57.825
but I... I couldn't sleep. Um,
I was crying and I was, uh...

26:57.908 --> 26:59.535
I was really scared.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.291
[sobbing]
And you, um...

27:05.374 --> 27:08.544
You just held me and...
rubbed my back,

27:08.627 --> 27:10.963
and you were humming this song
and you said to me

27:11.047 --> 27:12.590
that it was a song that
Grandma had sung to you,

27:12.673 --> 27:14.884
and... and so I just, I...

27:17.011 --> 27:19.472
I've been trying to
remember that song,

27:19.555 --> 27:23.351
and I can't remember it
and it's driving me crazy.

27:23.434 --> 27:27.146
And, um, I'm just...
I had to call and... and...

27:31.067 --> 27:33.194
How does it go, Mommy?
How does it go?
