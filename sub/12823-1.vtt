01:51.849 --> 01:54.432
Yeah, I worked
in a barber shop,

01:54.557 --> 01:57.557
But I never considered
myself a barber.

01:57.682 --> 02:02.099
I stumbled into it well,
married into it, more precisely.

02:02.224 --> 02:06.182
It wasn't my establishment.
Like the fella says, I only work here.

02:09.514 --> 02:11.181
The dump was 200 feet square...

02:11.473 --> 02:14.181
With three chairs,
or stations, as we call 'em,

02:14.473 --> 02:16.598
Even though there are only
two of us working.

02:16.723 --> 02:19.515
But this is my point.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.931
My point is that these traders and trappers
would come to this country,

02:23.056 --> 02:25.223
Get their pelts
and their gold "ignots"

02:25.515 --> 02:28.431
Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law,
was the principal barber.

02:28.515 --> 02:29.931
Man, could he talk.

02:31.848 --> 02:35.598
Maybe if you're 11 or 12 years old,
Frank's got an interesting point of view,

02:35.681 --> 02:38.140
But sometimes
it got on my nerves.

02:38.348 --> 02:40.140
Not that I complained,
mind you.

02:40.223 --> 02:42.680
Like I said, he was
the principal Barber.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.222
Frank's father August
they called him Guzzi

02:46.347 --> 02:48.972
Had worked the heads up
in Santa Rosa for 35 years...

02:49.097 --> 02:51.889
Until his ticker stopped
in the middle of a junior flattop.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.264
He left the shop to Frankie free and clear,

02:55.347 --> 02:57.972
And that seemed to satisfy
all of Frank's ambitions

02:58.055 --> 03:00.847
Cutting the hair
and chewing the fat.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.722
Me, I don't talk much.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.554
I just cut the hair.

03:18.845 --> 03:21.803
It says here that the russians
exploded an a-bomb...

03:21.887 --> 03:24.803
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

03:27.345 --> 03:29.345
How do you like them apples?

03:35.178 --> 03:38.345
Being a barber is a lot like
being a bar man or a soda jerk.

03:38.637 --> 03:42.803
There's not much to it once
you've learned the basic moves.

03:42.928 --> 03:44.887
For the kids, there's the butch,
or the heinie,

03:44.970 --> 03:46.927
The flattop, the ivy,

03:47.011 --> 03:48.802
The crew, the vanguard,

03:48.886 --> 03:50.302
The junior contour...

03:50.386 --> 03:53.844
And occasionally
the executive contour.

03:55.302 --> 03:59.052
Lived in a little bungalow
on napa street.

03:59.136 --> 04:00.927
The place was okay, I guess.

04:01.011 --> 04:04.135
Had an electric icebox,
a gas hearth...

04:04.260 --> 04:07.218
And a garbage grinde
built into the sink.

04:07.343 --> 04:09.676
You might say I had it made.

04:09.801 --> 04:12.343
Oh, year,
there was one other thing.

04:14.176 --> 04:16.593
Doris kept the books
at Nirdlingers,

04:16.676 --> 04:19.050
A small department store
on main street.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.591
Doris liked the work,
accounting.

04:21.675 --> 04:24.259
She liked knowing
where everything stood

04:24.342 --> 04:28.175
And she got a ten percent employee
discount on whatever she wanted

04:28.300 --> 04:29.800
Nylon stockings,

04:29.925 --> 04:32.717
Makeup and perfume.

04:34.634 --> 04:37.300
Doris and I went to church
once a week.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.759
Usually Tuesday night.

04:47.884 --> 04:50.759
Doris wasn't big
on divine worship,

04:50.842 --> 04:54.090
And I doubt if she believed
in life everlasting.

04:54.173 --> 04:57.132
She'd most likely tell you
that our reward is on this earth,

04:57.215 --> 04:59.923
And bingo is probably
the extent of it.

05:00.007 --> 05:01.632
B-7

05:01.715 --> 05:02.923
Watch you card,
honey.

05:03.007 --> 05:05.923
I wasn't crazy
about the game,

05:06.007 --> 05:08.090
But, I don't know,
it made her happy,

05:08.173 --> 05:11.298
And I found the setting
peaceful.

05:11.382 --> 05:12.798
Jesus. Bingo.

05:12.882 --> 05:14.090
Bingo!

05:15.257 --> 05:17.882
Doris's boss,
Big Dave Brewster,

05:18.007 --> 05:21.923
Was married to Ann Nirdlinger,
the department store heiress.

05:22.007 --> 05:24.214
Tonight they were coming over for dinner.

05:24.297 --> 05:26.047
As Doris said,

05:26.172 --> 05:28.589
We were entertaining.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.797
Me, I don't like
entertaining.

05:36.922 --> 05:38.881
- How you doin', Ed?
- Okay.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.797
Take your coat, Ann?

05:40.881 --> 05:44.339
The japs had us pinned down
on Buna for somethin' like six weeks.

05:44.588 --> 05:47.713
I gotta tell ya,
I thought we had it tough,
but we had supply.

05:47.838 --> 05:52.171
The japs were eatin' bugs
and grubs and thistles.

05:52.296 --> 05:55.130
Anyway, one day
we bust off the beach...

05:55.213 --> 05:59.254
And we find Arney Bragg,
this kid missin' on recon.

05:59.337 --> 06:02.087
The japs had eaten the son of a bitch.

06:02.170 --> 06:04.212
If you'll pardon the, uh...

06:04.337 --> 06:08.087
Anyway, he was a scrawny, pimply kid,
nothin' to write home about.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.170
I mean, I never woulda,
you know.

06:12.712 --> 06:15.087
So, what do I say, honey?

06:15.170 --> 06:18.004
What do I say
when I don't like dinner?

06:18.087 --> 06:19.587
Come on.
What do I say?

06:19.670 --> 06:22.170
I say,
"Arney Bragg, again?"

06:27.129 --> 06:29.044
Arney Bragg, again?

06:35.378 --> 06:38.210
- Were you in the service, Ed?
- No, Dave, I wasn't.

06:38.335 --> 06:41.752
Ed was 4-f on account
of his fallen arches.

06:46.668 --> 06:47.918
That's tough.

06:48.002 --> 06:49.918
That's... That's tough.

06:55.127 --> 06:59.710
Yeah, I guess Doris liked
all that he-man stuff.

06:59.835 --> 07:02.084
Sometimes I had the feeling that

07:02.167 --> 07:05.084
She and Big Dave were a lot closer
than they let on.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.792
The signs were all there,
plain enough.

07:17.876 --> 07:20.876
Not that I was gonna
prance about it, mind you.

07:21.001 --> 07:22.834
It's a free country.

07:24.584 --> 07:26.001
Holdin' down the porch area, Ed?

07:27.376 --> 07:30.166
- That's some wife you got there.
- Yeah.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.083
She's a rare one.

07:35.332 --> 07:36.957
So, how's business,
Dave?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.082
Oh, uh, couldn't be better.

07:40.165 --> 07:43.124
These are boom times
in retailin', Ed.

07:43.165 --> 07:45.624
We're openin' another store
over there on carson,

07:45.707 --> 07:48.915
Big Dave's annex.
Now, this is strictly haberdashery.

07:48.999 --> 07:52.124
It's casual wear, pajamas,
ladies' undergarments and foundations,

07:52.249 --> 07:53.999
That type of thing.

07:55.999 --> 08:00.040
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinkin' of makin' Doris the comptroller.

08:04.165 --> 08:06.581
Listen, when the annex opens up,
you gotta stop by.

08:06.664 --> 08:08.706
Maybe we can update your suit
a little bit, huh?

08:13.331 --> 08:15.789
Course, you're in
the smock all day.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.080
Where do you get those things,
anyway?

08:20.163 --> 08:23.622
Specialty store
down in Sacramento.

08:34.871 --> 08:36.330
You tie your own flies.

08:36.621 --> 08:40.078
I mean, if you're really serious,
you tie your own flies.

08:40.162 --> 08:41.621
You do, uh...

08:41.703 --> 08:43.996
I know. It's meticulous.
I know.

08:44.121 --> 08:46.746
People say, hey, you can
buy flies at the store.

08:46.829 --> 08:49.954
The point is, there's a certain art
to the process.

08:50.079 --> 08:52.537
The point is not merely to provide.

08:52.662 --> 08:57.037
Let me point out, these fish are not
as dumb as you might think.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.162
Sure.
Go to the store.

08:59.287 --> 09:02.662
Describe to the man
where you will be fishing and for what,

09:02.787 --> 09:07.704
And then you might as well have the man
sell you the goddamned fish, Ed.

09:07.829 --> 09:08.954
My point is,

09:09.079 --> 09:12.119
This is a man who knows nothing,
no matter how much you tell him.

09:12.202 --> 09:14.994
- So sell him the goddamned fish, Ed.
- Yeah.

09:16.577 --> 09:17.619
Okay.

09:18.660 --> 09:20.619
Who gets the privilege?

09:20.702 --> 09:22.535
We're just closing, friend.

09:22.785 --> 09:24.535
Oh, happy days.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.535
I wish I was doing well enough
to turn away business.

09:28.660 --> 09:32.660
What's the problem, friend?
This is a business establishment with posted hours.

09:32.827 --> 09:34.452
More power to ya, brother.

09:34.577 --> 09:35.619
The public be damned.

09:35.785 --> 09:36.619
Hey...

09:36.702 --> 09:38.577
I'll take care of him.
You go ahead, Frank.

09:38.660 --> 09:40.660
Have a seat, mister.

09:40.785 --> 09:43.660
- You sure, Eddie?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

09:46.784 --> 09:48.909
In your ear, mister.

09:51.034 --> 09:54.034
Oh, those fiery
Mediterraneans.

09:54.993 --> 09:58.243
Uh, say, uh,
not so fast there, brother.

10:00.826 --> 10:01.951
Pretty good, eh?

10:02.034 --> 10:03.950
Fools even the experts.

10:04.033 --> 10:07.533
One hundred percent human hair.
Handcrafted by Jacques

10:07.658 --> 10:09.242
Of San Francisco.

10:09.325 --> 10:12.533
I'd hate to have to tell you
what I paid for it.

10:12.658 --> 10:15.075
Yeah, it's a nice rug.

10:15.158 --> 10:17.074
I'm payin' it down
on the installment plan.

10:17.157 --> 10:21.116
A lot of folks live
with the pate exposed.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.657
They say the dames
think it's sexy,

10:23.782 --> 10:26.907
But for my money
it's just not good groomin'.

10:26.991 --> 10:30.782
And groomin' my friend,
is probably the most important thing in business.

10:30.866 --> 10:33.324
After personality, of course.

10:34.324 --> 10:36.782
Creighton Tolliver.
Pleased to know ya.

10:37.866 --> 10:39.282
Ed Crane.

10:40.282 --> 10:42.657
So, what brings you
to Santa Rosa?

10:42.782 --> 10:45.949
A goose, my friend.
I was chasin' a wild goose.

10:47.699 --> 10:49.656
Ed, have you ever heard
of venture capital?

10:49.781 --> 10:52.240
Risk money.
Very speculative.

10:52.323 --> 10:56.739
Except that in certain situations
it's not, see.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.947
I thought I had
a prospect here

10:59.030 --> 11:03.655
Well, I make the haul up...
And this lousy so-and-so tells me...

11:03.780 --> 11:05.614
That the situation has changed.

11:05.739 --> 11:09.239
All of his capital's tied up
in expansion plans of his own.

11:09.322 --> 11:12.072
Thank you mother.
Pop goes another bubble.

11:12.155 --> 11:15.030
It's only the biggest business opportunity
since Henry Ford,

11:15.155 --> 11:17.905
And I can't seem
to interest a soul.

11:17.989 --> 11:19.030
Is that right?

11:19.155 --> 11:21.114
It's called dry cleaning.

11:22.654 --> 11:25.279
You heard me right, brother.
Dry cleaning.

11:25.363 --> 11:28.154
Wash without water.

11:28.279 --> 11:31.904
No suds. No tumple.
No stress on the clothes.

11:31.988 --> 11:34.779
It's all done
with chemicals, friend.

11:34.821 --> 11:36.613
And here's the capper...

11:36.696 --> 11:38.029
No shrinkage.

11:38.988 --> 11:40.779
That's right.

11:40.821 --> 11:42.113
Dry cleaning.

11:42.154 --> 11:45.321
All I need is $10,000
to open up the first store.

11:45.613 --> 11:50.195
Then I use its cash flow
to finance another, and so on,

11:50.320 --> 11:53.612
Leapfrog, bootstrap myself
to a whole chain.

11:54.652 --> 11:56.152
Well, me and a partner.

11:57.819 --> 12:00.111
Cleanliness, friend.

12:00.236 --> 12:02.277
There's money in it.
There's a future.

12:02.361 --> 12:04.069
There's room to grow.

12:04.152 --> 12:07.319
Say, that looks pretty good.

12:07.611 --> 12:09.777
Let's see it
with the hairpiece on.

12:21.986 --> 12:23.777
Dry cleaning.

12:25.319 --> 12:28.735
Was I crazy
to be thinking about it?

12:28.818 --> 12:33.276
Was he a huckster or an opportunity,
the real Mccoy?

12:36.693 --> 12:40.984
My first instinct was
no, no, the whole idea was nuts.

12:41.109 --> 12:44.859
But maybe that was the instinct
that kept me locked in the barber shop,

12:44.984 --> 12:48.775
Nose against the exit
afraid to try turning the knob.

12:49.734 --> 12:51.067
- Honey?
- Hmm?

12:52.567 --> 12:54.650
Shave my legs, will ya?

12:59.983 --> 13:02.149
What if I could
get the money?

13:33.897 --> 13:36.106
It was clean.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.606
No water.

13:39.814 --> 13:41.606
Chemicals.

13:45.772 --> 13:47.606
Gimme a drag.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.772
Love ya, honey.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.605
What you...
uh, come in.

14:08.813 --> 14:11.896
Okay, yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.771
Oh. I thought
you were the porter.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.855
Can I help ya?

14:17.980 --> 14:19.730
I'm Ed.

14:19.813 --> 14:21.812
Ed Crane.

14:24.104 --> 14:26.187
Um, I cut your hair today.

14:27.812 --> 14:29.062
I'm the barber.

14:29.145 --> 14:31.770
Jesus, yeah.
The barber.

14:31.854 --> 14:34.604
I didn't recognize you
without the smock.

14:34.729 --> 14:36.770
Did I leave somethin'
at the shop?

14:36.854 --> 14:39.269
No. No,
it's nothing like that.

14:39.353 --> 14:42.728
Um, I-I might be interested
in that business proposition.

14:45.894 --> 14:47.103
You got the dough?

14:47.144 --> 14:49.686
Well, I can get it.

14:49.811 --> 14:52.186
Come in. Come in!

14:52.311 --> 14:53.728
Sit down over there.

14:53.811 --> 14:56.186
- Coffee?
- No.

14:56.311 --> 14:59.561
Well, sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

15:01.311 --> 15:03.519
So tell me...

15:03.769 --> 15:08.311
Other than putting up the money, uh,
exactly what would you want the partner to, uh...

15:08.603 --> 15:10.060
Do?

15:10.143 --> 15:11.768
Hell, nothin'.

15:11.852 --> 15:16.101
You're gonna want to keep
tabs on your investment,
The running of the business,

15:16.184 --> 15:18.851
but I'm looking for a silent partner.

15:18.976 --> 15:22.017
I've done the research,
I've contacted the vendors.

15:22.142 --> 15:23.726
The deal is set.

15:23.809 --> 15:28.059
Disappear, if you'd like.
Check in whenever you want.

15:28.142 --> 15:31.642
I want the dough.
I don't take attendance.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.226
And how do we share the...

15:33.351 --> 15:35.601
Fifty-fifty,
straight down the line.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.934
You and me.
Finance and expertise.

15:38.976 --> 15:40.934
So you got the dough then,
do ya?

15:41.017 --> 15:43.100
I can have it in a week.

15:43.225 --> 15:45.308
The barber...

15:46.808 --> 15:50.266
Well, I thought this trip
was gonna be a bust.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.600
Just shows to go ya,
when one door slams shut,

15:53.641 --> 15:55.600
Another one opens.

15:55.641 --> 15:57.975
Here's to you, uh...

16:27.681 --> 16:29.264
Was that a pass?

16:30.598 --> 16:32.014
Maybe.

16:33.014 --> 16:34.764
Well, you're out of line, mister

16:36.681 --> 16:38.223
Not a problem.

16:38.306 --> 16:40.056
Way out of line.

16:40.139 --> 16:42.139
Right.

16:42.264 --> 16:44.056
Strictly business.

16:46.723 --> 16:48.097
Okay.

16:59.012 --> 17:01.762
I sent it to Dave
the next morning.

17:01.887 --> 17:03.596
Then I waited.

17:24.136 --> 17:26.511
- Frank?
- Huh?

17:29.345 --> 17:31.220
This hair.

17:32.220 --> 17:34.053
Yeah?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.928
You ever wonder about it?

17:37.303 --> 17:38.803
What do you mean?

17:39.970 --> 17:42.095
I don't know.

17:42.178 --> 17:44.636
How it keeps on coming.

17:46.053 --> 17:49.094
It just keeps growing.

17:49.177 --> 17:51.552
Yeah.
Lucky for us, huh, pal?

17:51.635 --> 17:52.759
No, I mean,

17:54.176 --> 17:56.259
It keeps growing,

17:57.134 --> 17:59.051
And it's part of us.

18:00.801 --> 18:03.593
And then we cut it off
and throw it away.

18:04.718 --> 18:07.634
Come on, Eddie.
You're gonna scare the kid.

18:15.843 --> 18:17.843
Okay, bud, you're through.

18:32.217 --> 18:35.133
I'm gonna take this hair
and throw it out in the dirt.

18:35.258 --> 18:37.133
What?

18:39.050 --> 18:42.007
I'm gonna mingle it
with common house dirt.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.507
What the hell
are you talking about?

18:50.757 --> 18:52.549
I don't know.
Skip it.

19:02.298 --> 19:04.256
Ed, gimme a zip.

19:04.340 --> 19:06.840
Where you going?

19:06.965 --> 19:11.090
Us. The party at Nirdlingers.
I told you last week.

19:11.215 --> 19:14.756
The Christmas push.

19:15.798 --> 19:17.590
Come on, get ready.

19:17.673 --> 19:18.965
It's important.

19:19.090 --> 19:22.215
Nah, you go ahead.
I'm not big on parties.

19:22.298 --> 19:25.590
Oh, don't be a grump.
Gimme a zip.

19:55.004 --> 19:57.088
Hey, uh, ain't you
in ladies' wear?

19:58.879 --> 20:01.629
Huh? Haven't I seen you
up in ladies' wear?

20:01.754 --> 20:03.920
I don't work here.
My wife does

20:05.337 --> 20:07.087
Uh-huh. Whew.
That's some beat, huh?

20:07.212 --> 20:08.753
Yeah.
Lucky for us, huh, pal?

20:08.837 --> 20:11.795
Check out the rack
on that broad in the angora.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.920
Ed, can I talk to you?

20:15.003 --> 20:16.087
Sure.

20:18.837 --> 20:19.920
Come in.

20:23.669 --> 20:25.836
Oh, sit down.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.961
Souvenired it off a jap
in New Guinea.

20:34.336 --> 20:38.293
Guess you're, uh, wonderin'
what Doris was so hot about.

20:43.835 --> 20:45.085
Havanas.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.918
My private stock.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.210
Romeo and Juliet.

21:10.042 --> 21:11.709
Ed, I...

21:16.333 --> 21:18.791
What is it, Dave?

21:23.124 --> 21:24.583
Ed, I've been weak.

21:24.666 --> 21:27.249
I've been weak.
The, uh...

21:29.333 --> 21:31.583
You're gonna burn yourself.

21:34.666 --> 21:35.916
Thanks.

21:35.999 --> 21:37.249
I, uh...

21:40.290 --> 21:41.832
Oh, Jesus.

21:45.582 --> 21:47.582
I've been carryin' on
with a married woman.

21:49.790 --> 21:51.915
No one you know.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.540
And now the, uh,

21:54.665 --> 21:56.998
The chickens are
comin' home to roost.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.707
I got a note.

21:59.790 --> 22:01.790
A blackmail note, you know.

22:01.873 --> 22:04.040
Come across,
or everybody knows.

22:06.331 --> 22:09.081
I guess you know
what that would do to me.

22:12.955 --> 22:14.621
I guess that would be
pretty awkward.

22:14.746 --> 22:16.288
Awkward?

22:16.580 --> 22:19.205
Yeah. Yeah.

22:19.288 --> 22:22.621
Ann would throw me
right out on my keister.

22:22.746 --> 22:25.913
I mean, it's her st...
It's her family's store, Ed.
It's her store.

22:25.996 --> 22:29.580
I serve at the indulgence
of the goddamn ownership.

22:31.288 --> 22:33.205
The lady's husband
would know.

22:37.705 --> 22:41.163
- How much do they want, Dave?
- Ten thousand dollars.

22:41.288 --> 22:44.246
I don't know what to do, Ed.
I don't know what I can do.

22:45.745 --> 22:47.912
You know,

22:48.037 --> 22:50.287
I know who
the son of a bitch is.

22:53.329 --> 22:56.079
You know... who who is?

22:56.162 --> 22:57.745
The son of a bitch.
The blackmailer.

22:57.870 --> 22:59.786
I know who he is.

22:59.869 --> 23:02.828
It's no one you know.
It's a businessman from Sacramento.

23:02.953 --> 23:04.911
A goddamn pansy, Ed.

23:07.286 --> 23:10.286
Tryin' to rope me
into some crackpot scheme.

23:10.578 --> 23:13.244
I heard him out,
then I told him to go to hell.

23:13.328 --> 23:16.786
The very next day
the very next day I get a note,
the blackmail note,

23:16.828 --> 23:19.243
Asking me for the same amout of money
he asked me for.

23:19.327 --> 23:21.577
The very next day.
Ten thousand dollars.

23:25.077 --> 23:26.993
How did he know that
you were seein' the woman?

23:27.118 --> 23:30.118
He stayed at the hotel
that I went to with the, uh,

23:30.243 --> 23:33.577
lady in question.
He must've seen us.

23:34.868 --> 23:36.285
Oh, Jesus.

23:37.327 --> 23:40.785
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

23:48.952 --> 23:50.908
I don't know what to do.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.241
Why don't you just pay him. Dave?

24:05.325 --> 24:07.908
Cause that's my capitalization
on the annex.

24:07.991 --> 24:10.241
That's my operation.

24:12.241 --> 24:13.950
Christ almighty, Ed.

24:15.116 --> 24:18.075
That's what I just talkin'
to Doris about down there

24:18.158 --> 24:20.741
A way to get the money from the store
that we could hide from Ann.

24:22.616 --> 24:25.990
Doris, she was, she was pretty hot
about that, god bless her.

24:26.115 --> 24:28.782
Embezzlin', Ed.

24:28.907 --> 24:31.865
Embezzlin' from
my own goddamn wife.

24:36.949 --> 24:38.532
I'm sorry.

24:41.074 --> 24:42.739
I'm sorry.

24:44.073 --> 24:45.906
It's okay.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.197
In a way,
I felt bad for Big Dave.

25:00.280 --> 25:04.530
I knew that ten grand was going to
pinch him where it hurt,

25:04.613 --> 25:06.488
But Doris was two-timing me

25:06.613 --> 25:09.572
And I guess somewhere
that pinched a little too.

26:03.985 --> 26:05.694
That was pretty.

26:08.152 --> 26:09.819
Did you make that up?

26:09.944 --> 26:11.902
Oh, no.

26:12.027 --> 26:14.694
No, that was written
by Ludwig Van Beethoven.

26:20.027 --> 26:22.277
Well, it was quite something.

26:22.527 --> 26:25.026
Yeah, he wrote some
beautiful piano sonatas.

26:25.109 --> 26:28.109
That was really something.

26:33.109 --> 26:34.567
I'm Ed Crane.

26:34.650 --> 26:36.567
I know who you are, Mr. Crane.

26:36.650 --> 26:39.983
My father used to take me with him
when he went to get his hair cut.

26:40.108 --> 26:41.275
Walter Abundas?

26:41.525 --> 26:43.942
Oh, yeah, sure.
Walter.

26:45.067 --> 26:47.067
Yeah, I'm Rachel Abundas.

26:47.192 --> 26:49.150
But everyone call me Birdy.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.567
I'm sorry.
I just didn't remember.

26:52.650 --> 26:53.775
Oh, no, it's okay.

26:53.900 --> 26:58.817
You can't expect to remember
every skinny girl who comes in with her dad.

27:06.566 --> 27:08.899
So you don't, uh, like
that music out there?

27:09.024 --> 27:11.566
Not really.

27:11.691 --> 27:13.816
I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

27:14.857 --> 27:16.066
Ed.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.773
What a knucklehead.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.773
- Who?
- Dave.

27:35.190 --> 27:36.898
Why's that?

27:37.690 --> 27:39.147
Money problems.

27:39.272 --> 27:42.064
He's thinking about
canceling the annex.

27:42.939 --> 27:44.230
So?

27:45.272 --> 27:48.064
That means I don't run Nirdlingers.

27:53.730 --> 27:55.189
What a knucklehead.

28:01.022 --> 28:03.147
Big Dave did it, though.

28:08.688 --> 28:11.728
I sent a note telling him
where to drop the money.

28:13.728 --> 28:14.895
And he did.

28:14.978 --> 28:16.687
He came across.

28:55.686 --> 28:57.686
Yeah. Good!
How are ya?

28:57.769 --> 29:00.060
Come in.
I got everything organized.

29:00.143 --> 29:02.851
How you doin'?
You got a check?

29:02.935 --> 29:05.935
- Cash.
- Cash?

29:06.018 --> 29:08.935
Usually these kinds of things
are done with a bank draft,

29:09.018 --> 29:11.143
But cash, that's fine.

29:11.268 --> 29:13.268
It's all the same in the end.

29:14.935 --> 29:16.267
Dough is dough, huh?

29:18.100 --> 29:19.100
Whoa, nellie.

29:22.017 --> 29:23.850
I got the paperwork here.

29:23.934 --> 29:25.809
Partnership papers.

29:25.892 --> 29:27.642
They reflect our agreement.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.684
Fifty-fifty on the net.

29:29.767 --> 29:34.600
I provide professional services,
you provide the capital.

29:34.684 --> 29:38.100
I'm gonna give you a receipt
on the dough here.

29:38.225 --> 29:40.600
Uh, pretty straightforward.

29:40.684 --> 29:43.600
- I don't know whether you wanna show it to a lawyer
- No, that's okay.

29:43.684 --> 29:46.475
Yeah. Screw 'em, right?

29:46.600 --> 29:50.016
Pay them to tangle it up,
then you have to pay them to untangle them.

29:50.099 --> 29:52.098
What's the point?

29:52.182 --> 29:54.098
You just give me a second,

29:54.182 --> 29:56.890
I'll give you a receipt on the...

29:57.598 --> 29:58.723
Whoa, nellie.

30:00.098 --> 30:03.473
Okay, one thing
we didn't talk about was,

30:03.557 --> 30:06.473
I am thinking about,
uh, calling the place Tolliver's.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.223
After me, you know.

30:08.515 --> 30:12.557
I didn't think you were, uh,
much interested in, uh...

30:12.640 --> 30:16.057
- That's fine.
- Yeah, that's good. Good, good.

30:16.140 --> 30:19.640
Now, ready?
One second and I will...

30:19.765 --> 30:22.264
Okay, that's it.

30:24.014 --> 30:26.014
As per our discussion.

30:27.056 --> 30:28.764
All right, there it is,

30:28.889 --> 30:31.972
Writ large in legal escritoire.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.889
- And the, uh...
- Say, Creighton.

30:37.764 --> 30:39.639
You're not gonna screw me
on this.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.055
Screw you?

30:43.138 --> 30:44.513
Jesus.

30:46.263 --> 30:47.263
Take it to a lawyer.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.888
No, I insist!

30:49.971 --> 30:51.805
I insist!

30:51.888 --> 30:56.054
This is dry cleaning.
This is not some fly-by-night thing here.

30:57.304 --> 30:58.804
Oh, I'll tell you,

30:58.929 --> 31:02.720
I have been 13 years as an entrepreneur,
and I have never...

31:02.845 --> 31:04.137
- It's okay.
- Nobody's ever questioned me...

31:04.262 --> 31:06.595
Hey, you want the dough back?

31:06.679 --> 31:08.762
Huh? Huh? Do you know
who you're talkin' to here?

31:08.845 --> 31:11.137
Do you know who I am?
Do you have any idea who...

31:11.220 --> 31:12.554
It's okay.

31:13.929 --> 31:16.595
So, Tolliver's is okay, then?

31:20.262 --> 31:22.137
The next day was Saturday.

31:22.262 --> 31:25.054
We were going to a reception
for Doris's cousin Gina...

31:25.137 --> 31:28.178
Who just married a wop vendor
out near Modesto.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.803
Doris didn't much feel like going,
and I didn't either.

31:30.886 --> 31:35.052
But like she said,
we had a commitment.

31:37.093 --> 31:38.885
I hate wops.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.760
What's so goddamn strange
about that?

31:44.843 --> 31:46.218
I didn't say a word.

31:46.302 --> 31:48.510
You didn't have to
grow up with them.

31:50.552 --> 31:51.843
Family.

31:59.176 --> 32:01.801
Ed! Uncle Ed!

32:06.509 --> 32:10.134
He's riding Garibaldi!
Uncle Frankie's riding Garibaldi!

32:32.799 --> 32:34.882
That was when
she started drinking.

32:35.007 --> 32:35.799
Doris.

32:36.715 --> 32:37.549
Doris!

32:37.632 --> 32:39.674
You been okay?

32:39.757 --> 32:42.924
Mmm. Yeah.
How you doing, Costanza?

32:43.049 --> 32:46.257
Oh, you know.
Still got my health.

32:46.549 --> 32:48.715
And. Uh, how you been, uh...

32:49.882 --> 32:51.257
- Ed.
- Ed.

32:51.549 --> 32:53.965
He's a barber, right?

32:54.090 --> 32:57.715
It's a good trade.
So, how come you got no kids, huh?

32:57.799 --> 33:00.132
No, come on, kids!

33:00.215 --> 33:04.464
I- I just ate lunch!
I couldn't eat another thing.

33:04.548 --> 33:06.589
Oh, n... Anthony!

33:06.714 --> 33:09.089
Anthony, it's you!

33:09.214 --> 33:11.214
Okay, kids. Ready? And...

33:20.922 --> 33:25.130
Congratulations. Gina.
It's so goddamn wonderful.

33:25.213 --> 33:28.755
Life is just so goddamn wonderful,
You almost won't believe it.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.838
- It's just a bowl of goddamn cherries.
- Let' go.

33:30.922 --> 33:32.880
Sure.

33:35.797 --> 33:38.462
Congratulations on your goddamn cherries!

33:40.754 --> 33:42.546
Let go of my goddamn elbow!

33:54.504 --> 33:57.671
I never wanna see
another blueberry pie.

34:00.962 --> 34:04.212
I never even wanna hear those words.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.710
Don't say those words, Ed.

34:12.043 --> 34:14.043
Don't say those words.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.583
I'd met Doris blind
on a double date...

35:05.708 --> 35:09.250
With a loudmouthed buddy of mine
who was seeing a friend of hers from work.

35:09.542 --> 35:13.458
We went to a movie.
Doris had a flask.

35:13.583 --> 35:15.749
Boy, she could put it away.

35:19.166 --> 35:23.582
At the end of the night,
she said she liked that I didn't talk much.

35:23.707 --> 35:26.749
It was only a couple weeks later
she suggested we get married.

35:35.874 --> 35:37.166
Yeah.

35:37.249 --> 35:41.166
Ed, it's Big Dave.
I gotta talk to you.

35:41.249 --> 35:42.791
What?

35:43.624 --> 35:44.999
Now?

35:45.916 --> 35:48.123
Yeah. It's important.

35:48.915 --> 35:50.706
But it-it's...

35:50.831 --> 35:52.706
Please, Ed.

35:54.122 --> 35:55.955
Your place?

35:56.039 --> 35:57.997
I'm at the store.

35:58.122 --> 36:00.455
Let yourself in.

36:57.036 --> 36:58.202
Dave?

37:02.536 --> 37:04.119
I'm ruined.

37:07.911 --> 37:10.036
They've ruined me.

37:10.119 --> 37:11.994
This money.

37:13.161 --> 37:14.786
No annex.

37:15.744 --> 37:17.744
I'm all shot to hell.

37:19.702 --> 37:21.702
So, you paid the guy?

37:32.076 --> 37:34.035
What kind of man are you?

37:36.784 --> 37:38.909
What kind of man...

37:39.034 --> 37:40.492
Are you?

37:43.867 --> 37:46.950
I mean, I'd understand
if you came in here and...

37:47.075 --> 37:49.575
Socked me in the nose, whatever.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.534
I deserve it.

37:52.659 --> 37:55.200
I'm not proud of what I did.

37:56.741 --> 37:58.574
But you.

38:02.699 --> 38:04.033
Yeah, I paid up.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.491
As you well know.

38:09.283 --> 38:11.699
But then I went and
found the pansy.

38:17.949 --> 38:20.116
Oh, you got nothin' to say, huh?

38:20.241 --> 38:23.199
Well, you know the story.

38:24.074 --> 38:26.991
I didn't.

38:27.074 --> 38:29.697
I had to beat it
out of the pansy.

39:00.656 --> 39:02.530
I'm all shot to hell.

39:09.530 --> 39:11.238
Well, Dave, uh...

42:21.228 --> 42:25.020
It was only a couple weeks later
she suggested we get married.

42:28.936 --> 42:31.728
I said, "Don't you want
to get to know me more?"

42:31.853 --> 42:34.603
She said, "Why?
Does it get better?"

42:36.853 --> 42:38.770
She looked at me
like I was a dope,

42:38.895 --> 42:41.520
Which I never
really minded from her.

42:41.603 --> 42:44.520
And she had a point,
I guess.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.852
We knew each other
as well then as now.

42:47.894 --> 42:50.434
Anyway, well enough.

43:03.643 --> 43:06.726
Holy, moley,
do I got a headache.

43:06.851 --> 43:09.518
- How are you today, Ed?
- Okay.

43:10.851 --> 43:13.476
- You don't got a headache?
- No.

43:14.643 --> 43:17.809
Damn, I got a headache
to beat the band.

43:22.101 --> 43:25.642
Did you pump it? You can't pump it.
That'll just flood it.

43:25.725 --> 43:30.600
No, no, no, you gotta pump it.
You can't just hold it down.
I mean that'll flood it.

43:30.725 --> 43:33.100
You crazy?
You pump it.

43:33.225 --> 43:35.558
You can't hold it down.

43:36.892 --> 43:39.891
- Just turn the key.
- Not when it's cold.

43:39.974 --> 43:41.974
Well, if it's cold, choke it.

43:42.099 --> 43:43.641
And pump it.

43:43.766 --> 43:45.141
How many time?

43:49.099 --> 43:50.932
Ed Crane?

43:54.557 --> 43:56.473
I'm Crane.

43:56.556 --> 43:59.098
- Come on outside.
- Sure.

44:14.973 --> 44:17.806
I'm officer Persky.
This is Krebs.

44:19.723 --> 44:21.515
Well, we goin'?

44:26.765 --> 44:27.805
Cigarette?

44:31.554 --> 44:32.679
Right.

44:34.679 --> 44:37.013
Pete's got some news for ya.

44:42.846 --> 44:44.221
Look, pal, um,

44:46.138 --> 44:48.013
It's a tough break, but, um,

44:49.804 --> 44:51.596
Well, damn it,
your wife's been pinched.

44:51.721 --> 44:54.679
They sent us around
to tell you.

44:56.554 --> 44:59.179
They sent us around to tell you.
We pulled the detail.

45:01.095 --> 45:03.428
My wife?

45:03.553 --> 45:06.845
Yeah, they brung her down
to county jail.

45:07.928 --> 45:09.137
Homicide.

45:09.220 --> 45:11.053
Well, embezzlement...

45:11.178 --> 45:12.762
And homicide.

45:12.887 --> 45:16.428
Guy named David Brewster.
He's the guy she...

45:16.553 --> 45:18.053
H- He's the decedent.

45:18.803 --> 45:20.470
I don't understand.

45:20.553 --> 45:22.052
He's the dead guy.

45:22.177 --> 45:25.927
Yeah, it's a tough break.

45:27.552 --> 45:29.719
Visiting ends at 5:00.

45:29.844 --> 45:32.011
Oh, uh, missed it today,
but, uh,

45:33.010 --> 45:34.801
You can go see her tomorrow.

45:36.551 --> 45:38.176
Sorry, pal.

45:38.218 --> 45:40.551
They sent us to tell ya.

45:42.385 --> 45:44.176
Crab detail.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.592
- Hello, Walter.
- Hello, Ed.

46:13.549 --> 46:16.549
Thanks.
Thanks for seein' me at home.

46:16.674 --> 46:19.466
Oh, hell.
Want a drink?

46:21.466 --> 46:22.466
Uh, no, thanks.

46:22.549 --> 46:24.799
You sure you don't need one?

46:24.883 --> 46:26.758
I'm fine.

46:27.924 --> 46:30.008
- Boy.
- Yeah.

46:31.508 --> 46:32.966
Jesus.

46:35.883 --> 46:37.840
So, uh,
What do I, uh...

46:37.923 --> 46:40.423
Of course, uh, I, uh...

46:41.173 --> 46:43.673
It's out of my league.

46:43.798 --> 46:48.132
No, I... no, I-I do probate
and real estate...

46:48.215 --> 46:49.507
And title search.

46:50.965 --> 46:54.673
I'd be absolutely worthless,
somethin' like this. Absolutely worthless.

46:57.048 --> 46:58.423
Excuse me.

46:59.965 --> 47:01.965
I just finished dinner.

47:05.714 --> 47:09.214
Frankly, Doris'd be better off
with the county defender.

47:09.506 --> 47:12.421
- He a good man?
- Bert's okay.

47:12.546 --> 47:15.171
Yeah, he...
he's a good man.

47:16.796 --> 47:19.796
Listen. I won't kid you, Ed.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.671
Uh, there's nobody around here
has any experience with this kind of thing.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.171
I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up.

47:27.213 --> 47:29.213
From, uh, Sacramento.

47:31.046 --> 47:34.713
It's a capital offense.
They're taking it seriously.

47:34.838 --> 47:36.796
- So...
- They're taking it seriously.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.213
So, what-what, uh...

47:39.505 --> 47:41.963
Do you want any more coffee, dad?
Oh, hi, Mr. Crane.

47:43.045 --> 47:44.587
Hello, Rachel.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.837
I was so sorry to hear.

47:50.545 --> 47:51.837
Yeah, thanks.

47:51.962 --> 47:54.170
- Coffee, Ed?
- No, thanks.

47:54.212 --> 47:56.961
- Ah, no, thanks, honey. We're...
- Okay, dad.

47:57.044 --> 47:59.128
It was good to see you again,
Mr. Crane.

48:03.253 --> 48:04.669
Damn.

48:05.919 --> 48:07.169
A good kid.

48:07.211 --> 48:08.669
Jesus...

48:13.919 --> 48:17.668
Who do you think?

48:17.710 --> 48:20.168
Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco.

48:20.877 --> 48:22.460
Probity.

48:22.543 --> 48:27.210
You know, nobody ever said anything iffy
about Lloyd Garroway.

48:28.210 --> 48:30.168
He's conservative.

48:30.460 --> 48:33.418
Jury might like that.
Might like that here.

48:35.710 --> 48:36.793
Probity.

48:36.877 --> 48:40.710
So, he's, uh,
the best man for...

48:40.835 --> 48:42.085
No.

48:42.210 --> 48:45.960
The best, the money-is-no-object best,

48:46.043 --> 48:49.625
any lawyer'll tell you,
is Freddy Riedenschneider from...

48:52.166 --> 48:53.791
Sacramento.

48:55.125 --> 48:57.833
I don't know
how you're fixed for money.

48:57.958 --> 48:59.833
- But he's...
- The best.

48:59.958 --> 49:01.416
The best, yeah.

49:04.041 --> 49:06.000
Riedenschneider.

49:15.041 --> 49:16.875
No question about it.

49:46.539 --> 49:47.664
Honey.

50:04.705 --> 50:06.580
I brought your makeup.

50:08.497 --> 50:09.663
Glasses.

50:16.830 --> 50:18.705
What happened to you?

50:18.830 --> 50:21.122
I don't know
what's goin' on... I...

50:24.705 --> 50:26.579
I don't know
what happened to Big Dave.

50:26.704 --> 50:28.496
I know some of it.

50:28.579 --> 50:31.828
Irregullarities in the books, they said.
Can I explain it?

50:32.995 --> 50:35.120
You don't have to
explain anything.

50:35.203 --> 50:38.120
I did help him cook the books, Ed.
I did do that.

50:44.953 --> 50:46.120
Should I...

50:47.911 --> 50:51.578
Should I tell you
why I changed the books?

50:54.870 --> 50:57.536
You don't have to
tell me anything.

50:58.952 --> 51:00.785
No, no, no!

51:02.119 --> 51:03.494
Jesus Christ!

51:18.452 --> 51:20.160
My books used to be perfect.

51:20.244 --> 51:23.784
Anyone could open 'em up
and make sense of the whole goddamn store.

51:28.451 --> 51:30.409
I knew we'd pay for it.

51:30.534 --> 51:32.075
I don't care what it costs!

51:32.200 --> 51:35.533
This is when you come together.

51:35.658 --> 51:37.158
Well, that's awfully
generous of you, Frank.

51:37.450 --> 51:40.450
The hell with it.
The hell with it, Eddie.

51:40.575 --> 51:42.492
This is when you come together.

51:42.575 --> 51:44.492
This is family.

51:47.950 --> 51:51.158
They're just people
like you and me, Ed.

51:51.450 --> 51:52.950
Remember that.

51:54.533 --> 51:56.492
Just people.

51:56.575 --> 52:00.950
They gotta put up the big front
so that people will trust 'em with their money.

52:01.033 --> 52:03.491
This is why the big lobby, Ed.

52:03.574 --> 52:08.407
But they put their pants on
one leg at a time just like you and me.

52:10.157 --> 52:13.741
They, too, use the toilet, Ed,
in spite of appearances.

52:13.866 --> 52:16.906
And their money will be secured
by the barber shop.

52:17.031 --> 52:19.990
A rock.
A rock, the barber shop.

52:20.115 --> 52:21.906
Mr. Raffo.

52:22.031 --> 52:23.698
Yes, sir?

52:23.823 --> 52:25.781
Could you come with me,
please?

52:25.906 --> 52:28.031
Sure.
Can Ed come too?

52:28.156 --> 52:29.615
Mister...

52:30.198 --> 52:33.115
Crane.
Ed Crane.

52:33.198 --> 52:36.072
You also have an interest
in the securing porperty?

52:37.530 --> 52:39.155
He's a barber.

52:39.239 --> 52:42.780
- Second chair.
- Not an owner.

52:42.905 --> 52:46.822
No, he's, uh, family.
He's my brother-in-law.

52:46.947 --> 52:50.155
It would be best
if he waited here.

53:28.070 --> 53:29.903
The barber shop.

53:33.903 --> 53:37.903
Doris and Frank's father had worked
30 years to own it free and clear.

53:38.028 --> 53:42.027
Now it got signed over to the bank,
and the bank signed some over to Frank.

53:42.152 --> 53:45.569
And Frank signed the money
to Freddy Riedenschneider.

53:45.694 --> 53:47.819
Who got into town
two days later...

53:47.902 --> 53:50.777
And told me to meet him
at Da Vinci's for lunch.

53:53.486 --> 53:55.986
Not fried, poached.
Three of 'em for two minutes.

53:56.111 --> 53:59.110
Strip steak, medium rare,
flapjacks, potatoes, tomato juice...

53:59.193 --> 54:00.526
And plenty of hot coffee.

54:01.568 --> 54:04.151
- You have any Prairie Oysters?
- No, sir.

54:04.235 --> 54:07.401
Then bring me a fruit cocktail
while I wait.

54:09.818 --> 54:11.818
- You're Crane?
- Yeah.

54:11.943 --> 54:13.484
Barber, right?

54:13.609 --> 54:15.484
I'm Freddy Riedenschneider.
Hungry?

54:15.567 --> 54:16.817
Uh, not really.

54:16.900 --> 54:19.734
They tell me the chow's okay here.
I made some inquiries.

54:21.192 --> 54:24.275
Look, I don't want to waste your time,
so I'll eat while we talk.

54:24.442 --> 54:25.567
Do you mind?
You don't mind.

54:25.692 --> 54:28.525
While I'm in town
I'm staying at the Hotel Metropole.

54:28.609 --> 54:32.609
Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy.
They named their suites after operas.

54:32.692 --> 54:34.650
Room's okay, though.
I poked around.

54:34.734 --> 54:37.109
I'm having 'em hold it for me.
I'll be back and forth.

54:37.192 --> 54:40.650
So, in addition to my retainer,
you're paying hotel,

54:40.734 --> 54:42.484
Living expenses, secretarial,

54:42.567 --> 54:45.817
Private eye, if we need to make inquiries,
head shrinker, should we go that way.

54:45.899 --> 54:48.024
We'll talk about appeals
if, as and when.

54:48.149 --> 54:51.815
- For now, has she confessed?
- No, of course not. She didn't do it.

54:51.898 --> 54:55.440
Good. That helps. Not that she didn't do it
That she didn't confess.

54:55.523 --> 54:59.440
Course, There's ways to deal with a confession,
but that's one less thing to think about.

54:59.523 --> 55:02.607
Now, interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow.
You sholud be there 3:00.

55:02.690 --> 55:04.940
One more thing.
You keep your mouth shut.

55:05.023 --> 55:07.815
I get the lay of the land,
I tell you what to say.

55:07.898 --> 55:11.148
No talking out of school.
What's out of school?
Everything's out of school.

55:11.232 --> 55:13.773
I do the talking.
You keep your trap shut.

55:13.898 --> 55:15.940
I'm an attorney. You're a barber.
You don't know anything.

55:19.064 --> 55:19.981
Okay.

55:20.064 --> 55:22.522
Good. Any questions,
give me a ring.

55:22.647 --> 55:24.981
Turandot suite.
If I'm out, leave a message.

55:26.189 --> 55:29.106
Sure you don't want anything?
No? Okay.

55:29.189 --> 55:31.147
You're okay, pal.

55:31.439 --> 55:33.772
You're okay, she's okay,
everything's gonna be hunky...

55:33.856 --> 55:35.897
And the...
and the flapjacks, honey.

55:43.105 --> 55:44.521
There they were,

55:47.521 --> 55:49.730
All going about their business.

55:51.895 --> 55:53.854
It seem like I knew a secret,

55:53.937 --> 55:57.437
A bigger one, even,
than what had really happened to Big Dave,

55:57.520 --> 56:00.395
Something none of them knew.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.979
Like I had made it to the outside somehow,

56:03.104 --> 56:05.729
And they were all still struggling
way down below.

56:29.186 --> 56:30.394
Ann.

56:31.686 --> 56:33.019
Hello, Ed.

56:33.893 --> 56:36.143
Would you like to come in, Ann?

56:37.685 --> 56:40.143
No. No, it's very late.

56:44.227 --> 56:46.810
I'm so sorry about your loss.

56:52.185 --> 56:56.392
Course you know that Doris
had nothing to do with it.

56:56.517 --> 56:58.601
Nothing at all.

56:59.101 --> 57:00.976
I know.

57:01.809 --> 57:04.017
Don't worry, Ed.

57:04.934 --> 57:06.892
I came to tell you...

57:07.017 --> 57:10.392
And you should tell Doris...

57:10.476 --> 57:11.476
Yeah?

57:22.517 --> 57:26.391
You know how Big Dave loved camping
and the out of doors?

57:28.765 --> 57:29.849
Yeah.

57:29.974 --> 57:34.057
We went camping last summer
in Eugene, Oregon.

57:34.140 --> 57:37.765
Outside Eugene, Ed.

57:39.765 --> 57:40.765
Yeah?

57:40.974 --> 57:44.724
At night there were lights.
We both saw them.

57:44.807 --> 57:48.807
We never told anyone
outside of our official report,

57:48.932 --> 57:50.849
Our report to the government.

57:52.974 --> 57:54.765
There was a spacecraft.

57:55.807 --> 57:57.932
I saw the creatures.

57:58.015 --> 58:00.974
They led Big Dave onto the craft.

58:01.057 --> 58:04.473
He never told anyone
what they did.

58:04.598 --> 58:06.181
Ann, would you like to...

58:06.306 --> 58:10.848
I cannot repeat it to you,
but this thing goes deep, Ed.

58:10.973 --> 58:13.806
It goes deep
and involves the government.

58:13.848 --> 58:18.055
This was not your wife.
There's a great deal of fear.

58:18.138 --> 58:22.097
You know how certain circles
would-would find it,

58:22.180 --> 58:23.222
The knowledge, a threat.

58:23.305 --> 58:25.722
They-they try to limit it, and...

58:25.805 --> 58:29.722
Ann, would you like to come in,

58:29.805 --> 58:32.513
Sit down?

58:32.638 --> 58:34.596
Maybe have a drink.

58:39.512 --> 58:42.262
Sometimes knowledge
is a curse, Ed.

58:44.137 --> 58:46.846
After this happened,

58:46.971 --> 58:48.304
Things changed.

58:50.804 --> 58:51.929
Big Dave...

58:56.137 --> 58:58.596
He never touched me again.

59:01.512 --> 59:03.096
Tell Doris not to worry.

59:03.179 --> 59:05.804
I know it wasn't her.

59:06.845 --> 59:08.635
Perhaps this will
bring it out

59:08.719 --> 59:10.260
Finally.

59:10.510 --> 59:14.177
Perhaps now
it will all come out.

59:43.759 --> 59:45.259
It stinks.

59:45.551 --> 59:47.176
But it's true.

59:47.301 --> 59:49.634
I don't care it's true, it's not true.
It stinks.

59:49.676 --> 59:52.259
You say he was being blackmailed?
By who? You don't know.

59:52.551 --> 59:54.843
For having an affair.
With who? You don't know.

59:54.968 --> 59:58.551
Did anyone else know about it?
Probably not. You don't know.

59:58.634 --> 01:00:00.717
I knew about it.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.883
Big Dave told me about it...

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:05.800
And the spot he was putting himself in
by getting the money.

01:00:05.842 --> 01:00:09.217
Terrific! Your husband backs you up.
That's terrific.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.092
Come on, you gotta give me
something to work with.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:14.049
Freddy Riedenschneider is good,
but he's not a magician.

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:17.591
He can't just wave his little wand in the air
to make a plausible defense materialize.

01:00:17.674 --> 01:00:20.591
Look at what the other side
is gonna run at us.

01:00:20.674 --> 01:00:23.257
They got the company books
prepared by you,

01:00:23.507 --> 01:00:25.674
Cooked by you.
That's motive.

01:00:25.799 --> 01:00:28.841
They got a murder scene you had access to.
That's opportunity.

01:00:28.966 --> 01:00:31.674
They got that little trimmer thing he was
stabbed in the throat with.

01:00:31.799 --> 01:00:33.924
- A dame's weapon.
- It was Big Dave's.

01:00:34.007 --> 01:00:35.799
Don't interrupt me.
That's means.

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:38.882
They got a fine, upstanding pillar
of the business community as a victim,

01:00:38.966 --> 01:00:40.591
And then they got you,

01:00:40.674 --> 01:00:43.965
A disgruntled, number-juggling underling,

01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:46.548
Who on the day in question
was drunk as a skunk...

01:00:46.631 --> 01:00:51.547
And whose alibi for the time in question
is being passed out at home, alone.

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.755
I was with her.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.797
Like I say,

01:00:55.922 --> 01:00:57.505
It stinks.

01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:07.547
I killed him.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:25.754
Okay. You killed him.

01:01:27.213 --> 01:01:31.796
Okay, we forget the blackmail thing.
You killed him.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.171
How come?

01:01:36.504 --> 01:01:39.046
He and Doris, uh,
were having an affair.

01:01:42.879 --> 01:01:44.253
Okay.

01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:46.462
How did you know?

01:01:48.837 --> 01:01:51.044
I just knew.

01:01:51.794 --> 01:01:53.919
A husband knows.

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.794
Will anyone else say they knew?

01:01:56.836 --> 01:01:58.127
And don't say your wife.

01:01:58.169 --> 01:02:00.044
I don't know.

01:02:02.169 --> 01:02:04.461
I don't think so.

01:02:05.836 --> 01:02:07.961
How did you get into the store?

01:02:08.086 --> 01:02:09.836
I took Doris's keys.

01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:14.044
Will anyone say they saw you there,
on your way there, in there, on your way back?

01:02:16.002 --> 01:02:18.086
I don't think so.

01:02:18.211 --> 01:02:21.626
Will anyone corroborate any goddamn part
of your story at all?

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:25.085
Oh, come on! People,
you can't help each other like that.

01:02:26.585 --> 01:02:28.960
Let's be realistic, now.

01:02:29.043 --> 01:02:33.668
Let's look at our options.
Well, frankly, I don't see any options.

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:37.750
Look, I cannot present story "A."
I cannot present

01:02:37.834 --> 01:02:40.000
story "B."

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:43.500
I could plead you for a nutcase,
but you look too composed.

01:02:43.625 --> 01:02:45.625
I could offer a guilty plea,
and in return they don't give you the juice,

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.625
But I don't think you want to spend
the rest of your life in chino.

01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:49.750
I know you didn't hire Freddy Riedenschneider

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:51.959
To hold your hand at a sentencing hearing.

01:02:52.084 --> 01:02:53.959
You could have gotten
Lloyd Garroway for that.

01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:56.791
No, no, no, no.
We're not giving up yet.

01:02:56.916 --> 01:03:00.041
You hired Freddy Riedenschneider,
It means you're not throwing in the towel.

01:03:00.124 --> 01:03:01.458
I litigate.

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:03.791
I don't capitulate.

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:07.249
All right. No options?
We gotta think.

01:03:07.499 --> 01:03:11.791
All right. We go back
to the blackmail thing. Yeah, it titillates.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:14.041
It's open-ended,
and it makes him the bad guy.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.833
You dig around, you never know.
Something unsavory from his past.

01:03:16.958 --> 01:03:20.916
He approaches you to help him with the money,
his past comes back to haunt him. Who's to say?

01:03:20.999 --> 01:03:24.666
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Forget the jealous husband thing. That's just silly.

01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:27.081
We're going with the blackmail.
I'll be in touch.

01:03:27.164 --> 01:03:28.831
I'm comin' out!

01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:41.622
Of course there was one person
who could confirm Doris's story,

01:03:41.747 --> 01:03:43.247
Or plenty of it.

01:03:43.497 --> 01:03:46.122
The dry-cleaning pansy.

01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:48.956
But he'd left the hotel,
skipped out on his bill.

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:53.497
He'd also disappeared
from the residence he gave me,

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:55.164
Owing two months'rent.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:57.706
How could I have been so stupid?

01:03:57.789 --> 01:04:00.455
Handing over $10,000
for a piece of paper.

01:04:02.496 --> 01:04:05.580
And the man gone,
like a ghost.

01:04:05.705 --> 01:04:10.080
Disappeared into thin air
vaporized like the nips at Nagasaki.

01:04:10.163 --> 01:04:11.788
Gone now.

01:04:15.163 --> 01:04:17.705
All gone.

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:20.912
The money gone,
Big Dave gone,

01:04:20.995 --> 01:04:23.954
Doris going.

01:04:24.037 --> 01:04:26.454
How could I have been so stupid?

01:05:07.827 --> 01:05:11.117
Sooner or later,
everyone needs a haircut.

01:05:13.617 --> 01:05:15.742
We were working for the bank now.

01:05:15.867 --> 01:05:19.659
We kept cutting the hair,
trying to stay afloat,

01:05:19.784 --> 01:05:23.826
Make the payments,
tread the water day by day,

01:05:25.034 --> 01:05:26.784
Day by day.

01:05:30.617 --> 01:05:32.867
Most people think someone's
accused of a crime,

01:05:32.951 --> 01:05:36.117
They haul 'em in and bring 'em to trial,
But it's not like that.

01:05:36.242 --> 01:05:37.866
It's not that fast.

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.950
The wheels of justice turn slow.

01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:43.908
They have the arraignment,
then the indictment,

01:05:43.991 --> 01:05:48.116
And they entertain motions to dismiss
and postpone and change the venue...

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.741
And alter this and that
and the other.

01:05:50.866 --> 01:05:53.700
They impanel a jury,
which bring more motions.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.700
Then they set a trial date,
and then they change the date.

01:05:56.783 --> 01:05:58.866
And then, often as not,
they'll change it again.

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.700
Not guilty, your honor.

01:06:04.532 --> 01:06:07.115
And through all of it,
we cut the hair.

01:06:13.031 --> 01:06:16.781
Meantime, Freddy Riedenschneider
slept at the Metropole...

01:06:20.489 --> 01:06:22.948
And shoveled it in
at Da Vinci's.

01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:26.781
He'd brought in a private investigator
from Sacramento...

01:06:26.906 --> 01:06:29.781
To nose around
into Big Dave's past.

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:52.072
I found myself, more and more,
going over to the Abundas's.

01:06:52.155 --> 01:06:55.904
It was a routine we fell into
most every evening.

01:06:55.987 --> 01:06:59.862
I even went when Walter was away
on his research trips.

01:07:02.987 --> 01:07:04.946
He was a genealogist,

01:07:05.071 --> 01:07:08.154
Had traced back his side of the family
seven generations,

01:07:08.279 --> 01:07:10.154
His late wife's eight.

01:07:10.279 --> 01:07:12.612
It seemed like a screwy hobby,

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:15.195
But then maybe all hobbies are.

01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:22.861
Maybe Walter found something there
in the old county courthouses,

01:07:22.945 --> 01:07:24.986
Hospital file rooms,

01:07:25.111 --> 01:07:27.861
City archives, property rolls,

01:07:27.945 --> 01:07:29.236
Registries.

01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:33.861
Something maybe like what I found
listening to Birdy play.

01:07:34.861 --> 01:07:36.861
Some kind of escape.

01:07:37.695 --> 01:07:39.778
Some kind of peace.

01:08:22.274 --> 01:08:25.774
They got this guy in Germany.

01:08:26.942 --> 01:08:29.608
Fritz something or other.

01:08:30.608 --> 01:08:32.233
Or is it...
Maybe it's Werner.

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:35.942
Anyway...
He's got this theory.

01:08:37.274 --> 01:08:40.107
You want to test something,
you know, scientifically...

01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:43.232
How the planet
go 'round the sun,

01:08:43.524 --> 01:08:46.066
What sunspots are made of,

01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:48.816
Why the water
comes out of the tap...

01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:52.024
Well, you gotta look at it.

01:08:52.107 --> 01:08:55.689
But sometimes
you look at it...

01:08:55.773 --> 01:08:59.189
Your looking changes it.

01:09:02.023 --> 01:09:05.856
You can't know the reality
of what happened,

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:07.148
Or what would have happened,

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:11.106
If you hadn't stuck in
your own goddamn schnozz.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:14.481
So there is no
"What happened."

01:09:14.606 --> 01:09:16.231
Looking at something...

01:09:16.523 --> 01:09:18.106
Changes it.

01:09:23.106 --> 01:09:26.022
They call it
the uncertainty principle.

01:09:26.104 --> 01:09:30.729
Sure, it sound screwy,
but even Einstein says
the guy's onto something.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.938
Science.

01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:38.188
Perception.

01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:40.145
Reality.

01:09:42.854 --> 01:09:43.938
Doubt.

01:09:45.604 --> 01:09:48.813
Reasonable... doubt.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.063
I'm saying that sometimes
the more you look,

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:56.229
the less you really know.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.520
It's a fact, a proved fact.

01:10:01.603 --> 01:10:03.770
In... In a way,

01:10:03.853 --> 01:10:06.228
It's the only fact there is.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.603
This Heinie even
wrote it out in numbers.

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.687
Burns?

01:10:25.769 --> 01:10:28.644
Subject:
David Allen Brewster,

01:10:28.769 --> 01:10:30.226
Born Brooklyn, 1911.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:33.935
Subject educated public schools.
One year case western university.

01:10:34.018 --> 01:10:35.810
Flunks out.

01:10:35.893 --> 01:10:40.060

01:10:40.143 --> 01:10:44.060

01:10:44.143 --> 01:10:46.643
1935, Arrested
on assault complaint.

01:10:46.768 --> 01:10:48.976
Complainant has a broken nose,
couple of broken ribs.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.851
'36, Another assault beef
at a bar room altercation.

01:10:52.935 --> 01:10:55.601
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Couple of fistfights, right?
Go to his service record.

01:10:58.268 --> 01:11:00.768
Inducted march 15, 1942.

01:11:00.851 --> 01:11:05.100
Served in a clerical capacity
in the U.S. Naval shipyards at San Diego.

01:11:05.184 --> 01:11:07.642
One fistfight,
broken up by the M.P.S.

01:11:07.767 --> 01:11:11.724
No court-martial.
Honorable discharge, may 8, 1945.

01:11:11.808 --> 01:11:15.933
- Since then, he's been clean.
- Thank you, Barns. Get lost.

01:11:26.183 --> 01:11:27.141
So?

01:11:27.266 --> 01:11:28.516
So?

01:11:30.016 --> 01:11:32.599
This could be your Dolly's
ticket out of the death house.

01:11:32.724 --> 01:11:34.099
So!

01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:36.890
I don't get it.

01:11:36.973 --> 01:11:39.848
Look, chump.

01:11:39.932 --> 01:11:44.432
This is a guy, from what I understand,
told everybody he was a war hero, right?

01:11:44.557 --> 01:11:45.723
Island-hopping,

01:11:45.807 --> 01:11:47.890
Practically liberated,
the pacific all by himself,

01:11:47.973 --> 01:11:50.765
With a knife in one hand,
a gun in the other,

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.640
And 20 yards of jap guts
between his teeth.

01:11:53.723 --> 01:11:56.973
And now it turns out this dope
spent the war sitting on his ass...

01:11:57.057 --> 01:12:00.223
In some boat yard
in San Diego.

01:12:00.473 --> 01:12:02.515
You asked for blackmail.

01:12:02.598 --> 01:12:06.097
Mr. Hail-fellow-well-met,
about to open his own business here,

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:09.638
Has been lying to everybody in this town
for the last four years,

01:12:09.721 --> 01:12:12.096
Probably including half the people
sitting on that jury.

01:12:12.221 --> 01:12:14.596
Well, it finally caught up with him.

01:12:14.721 --> 01:12:19.221
Somebody knew his dirty little secret,
just like your wife says.

01:12:19.513 --> 01:12:22.763
They called,
they demanded money.

01:12:24.471 --> 01:12:27.763
Did Big Dave say he'd recently
heard from an old friend?

01:12:27.888 --> 01:12:31.805
Did Big Dave mention it was something
about his war service?

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:35.013
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

01:12:35.096 --> 01:12:38.055
You have to tell us.

01:12:38.138 --> 01:12:41.095
Maybe he specified,
maybe he didn't.

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.220
I'm not putting words
in your mouth, no.

01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:48.929
But the point is that this liar,
this cynical manipulator,

01:12:49.012 --> 01:12:51.929
Turns to you to help him
out of his jam.

01:12:52.054 --> 01:12:53.970
Fat-assed son of a bitch.

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:59.219
- So who... who actually...
- Who?

01:12:59.511 --> 01:13:01.136
Who?

01:13:01.261 --> 01:13:02.761
I don't know who.

01:13:02.886 --> 01:13:05.969
But the point is that
if Mr. Prosecutor over there...

01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:09.636
Had devoted half the time
he's spent persecuting this woman...

01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:14.052
To even the most cursory investigation
of this schmo's past,

01:13:14.135 --> 01:13:16.052
Then we might know who.

01:13:16.135 --> 01:13:21.010
But we can't know who.
We can't know what really happened.

01:13:21.093 --> 01:13:24.093
Because the more you look,
the less you know.

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.968
But the beauty of it is...

01:13:29.093 --> 01:13:32.135
We don't gotta know.

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:36.677
We just gotta show that,
god damn it, they don't know.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.802
Because of Fritz, or Werner,
whatever the hell his name is.

01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:48.466
Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight.

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:51.133
We got a real shot at this, folks.
Let's not get cocky.

01:13:51.258 --> 01:13:52.758
Comin' out!

01:14:07.216 --> 01:14:09.050
Big Dave.

01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:17.091
What a dope.

01:14:24.257 --> 01:14:27.174
So maybe Riedenschneider
could fix it for Doris.

01:14:27.257 --> 01:14:29.799
Maybe it would all work out.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.840
And I thought,

01:14:33.757 --> 01:14:35.549
I hoped,

01:14:35.632 --> 01:14:38.174
That maybe there was a way out
for me as well.

01:14:39.173 --> 01:14:41.923
He was deaf
when he wrote this.

01:14:42.881 --> 01:14:44.089
Who?

01:14:45.673 --> 01:14:46.839
Beethoven.

01:14:48.881 --> 01:14:52.588
He created it, but he never
actually heard it.

01:14:52.713 --> 01:14:55.630
I guess he just heard it all
in his head somehow.

01:15:03.213 --> 01:15:06.713
The girl had talent.
Anyone could see that.

01:15:06.797 --> 01:15:08.797
And she wasn't
some fly-by-nighter.

01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:11.713
She was just a good, clean kid.

01:15:11.797 --> 01:15:16.088
If she was going to have a career,
she'd need a responsible adult...
Looking out for her,

01:15:16.172 --> 01:15:18.713
Some kind of manager.

01:15:20.047 --> 01:15:23.462
She'd have contracts to look at,
be going out on tours,

01:15:23.546 --> 01:15:25.587
Playing on the radio, maybe.

01:15:25.712 --> 01:15:29.754
I could help her sort through all that without
charging her an arm and a leg.

01:15:29.878 --> 01:15:31.836
Just enough to get by.

01:15:36.045 --> 01:15:37.920
Then I could be with her,

01:15:38.045 --> 01:15:40.961
Enough to keep myself
feeling okay.

01:15:42.711 --> 01:15:45.170
Why couldn't that work?

01:15:45.253 --> 01:15:46.795
Why not?

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:55.544
- Hi, Mr. Crane.
- Hello, Birdy.

01:15:59.044 --> 01:16:00.919
I thought that was real good.

01:16:01.044 --> 01:16:04.502
Yeah, I messed up a little bit
on the, um, on the agitato,

01:16:04.585 --> 01:16:07.919
But if nobody noticed,
then it's okay.

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:13.877
Oh, this is, um,
a friend of mine.

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:17.002
Tony, um, Mr. Crane.

01:16:18.627 --> 01:16:20.002
Hello, Tony.

01:16:20.085 --> 01:16:22.043
Hello, sir.

01:16:38.125 --> 01:16:40.083
Congratulations.

01:16:43.167 --> 01:16:45.792
Think I'll be getting home now.

01:16:48.833 --> 01:16:50.750
It was...
nice to meet you, sir.

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:52.750
You too, Tony.

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.000
Why couldn't it work?

01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:03.124
Anyway, that's what I was thinking in the days
leading up to the trial.

01:17:03.207 --> 01:17:07.082
It seemed like once that was over,
I'd be ready for a new start.

01:17:07.166 --> 01:17:09.499
Freddy Riedenschneider
was busy preparing.

01:17:09.582 --> 01:17:11.832
He was very optimistic.

01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:16.040
And finally it came...
the first day of the trial,

01:17:16.123 --> 01:17:20.123
What Riedenschneider called
'The big show."

01:17:31.706 --> 01:17:35.830
Where's the judge?
How come there's no judge?

01:17:35.914 --> 01:17:37.830
Where's the judge, Ed?

01:17:39.497 --> 01:17:40.455
Riedenschneider.

01:17:40.539 --> 01:17:43.122
How come the judge
doesn't come out?

01:17:43.205 --> 01:17:47.997
The judge comes in last.
He'll come in when Doris gets here.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.997
So where's Doris?
I thought we started at 10:00.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.747
Hey, Riedenschneider.
Where's Doris?

01:17:54.872 --> 01:17:56.622
She's late.

01:17:56.705 --> 01:18:00.622
Late?
How can she be late?

01:18:00.747 --> 01:18:03.830
She's in prison, Ed.
None of us are in prison.

01:18:03.914 --> 01:18:07.787
And yet we're not late.
We're on time, Ed.

01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:09.828
How can Doris be late?

01:18:09.912 --> 01:18:12.662
What, they don't have
wake-up calls?

01:18:17.245 --> 01:18:19.453
- All rise.
- No, no.

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:21.787
Counselors.

01:18:35.787 --> 01:18:37.078
What's going on, Ed?

01:18:37.203 --> 01:18:40.202
I thought there
would be arguments,

01:18:40.452 --> 01:18:42.161
The bailiff and so forth.

01:18:46.994 --> 01:18:49.411
Ed, what is this?

01:18:49.536 --> 01:18:51.661
Is this procedure?

01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:13.534
In the matter of the people v. Doris Crane,

01:19:13.659 --> 01:19:15.909
Case number SR-87249,

01:19:15.992 --> 01:19:17.909
Cause now pending
is hereby dismissed...

01:19:18.034 --> 01:19:20.034
I don't understand it.

01:19:21.742 --> 01:19:25.159
Had a real shot at this.
I could've won this thing.

01:19:25.242 --> 01:19:27.534
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:19:27.617 --> 01:19:31.950
Your service is no longer needed...
And you are now discharge.

01:19:33.825 --> 01:19:35.784
She's hanged herself.

01:19:37.909 --> 01:19:42.492
I'd brought her a dress to wear to court,
and she'd used the belt.

01:19:42.575 --> 01:19:45.824
At first I thought she'd figured out somehow
how I fit into it...

01:19:45.908 --> 01:19:49.198
And couldn't stand it,
couldn't stand knowing.

01:19:49.448 --> 01:19:51.782
But that wasn't it, I'd find out later.

01:19:54.698 --> 01:19:58.657
For now, everything
just seemed ruined.

01:20:00.573 --> 01:20:03.073
Freddy Riedenschneider
went back to Sacramento,

01:20:03.157 --> 01:20:06.157
Still shaking his head,
saying it was the biggest disappointment

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.240
Of his professional career.

01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:10.823
Frankie fell to pieces.

01:20:10.907 --> 01:20:13.115
I suspect he was drinking.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.697
Anyway, he stopped
coming in to work.

01:20:16.822 --> 01:20:21.156
That left me to keep the place going,
or the bank would've taken it.

01:20:23.031 --> 01:20:25.947
I was the principal barber now.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:29.156
I hired a new man
for the second chair.

01:20:29.239 --> 01:20:32.739
I'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing
whie he came in for an interview,

01:20:32.864 --> 01:20:36.572
But I guess the new man had only kept quiet
because he was nervous.

01:20:36.697 --> 01:20:39.656
Once he had the job, he talked from the minute
I opened the shop in the morning...

01:20:39.739 --> 01:20:42.488
Until I locked up at night.

01:20:44.738 --> 01:20:47.530
For all I know, he talked to himself
on the way home.

01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:55.195
When I walked home, it seemed like everyone
avoided looking at me,

01:20:55.487 --> 01:20:57.570
As if I'd caught some disease.

01:20:58.654 --> 01:21:02.487
This thing with Doris,
nobody wanted to talk about it.

01:21:04.904 --> 01:21:08.237
It was like I was a ghost
walking down the street.

01:21:10.029 --> 01:21:12.154
And when I got home now,

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.820
The place felt empty.

01:21:25.153 --> 01:21:27.486
I sat in the house,

01:21:30.069 --> 01:21:32.193
But there was nobody there.

01:21:38.735 --> 01:21:40.985
I was a ghost.

01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:44.068
I didn't see anyone.

01:21:44.193 --> 01:21:46.152
No one saw me.

01:21:51.235 --> 01:21:53.485
I was the barber.

01:22:00.901 --> 01:22:04.776
Some bacon and potatoes,
which are supposed to come with it.

01:22:04.901 --> 01:22:08.567
So I pay for it, and I
put the change in my pocket
without really looking...

01:22:08.692 --> 01:22:11.151
'Cause, gosh,
who looks at the change
when you eat there every day?

01:22:11.234 --> 01:22:14.692
Two blocks later I look
at the change she gave me.
Golly, I'm two bits short.

01:22:14.776 --> 01:22:18.484
So I walk back over to Linton's,
find this gal, big argument.

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:22.151
She doesn't even recall
the transaction.

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:24.025
Doesn't recall the transaction.
No recollections.

01:22:24.608 --> 01:22:26.774
So I said, "Look, dear.
Go ahead. Look at the menu."

01:22:26.815 --> 01:22:28.940
If you're in before 6:00,
it's the whatchamacallit...

01:22:32.482 --> 01:22:34.440
- The early bird special.
- Yeah, the early riser.

01:22:39.732 --> 01:22:40.857
Crane?

01:22:41.649 --> 01:22:44.065
I'm Crane.

01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:47.065
My name's Diedrickson,
county medical examiner.

01:22:48.607 --> 01:22:49.857
Yeah?

01:22:52.565 --> 01:22:55.440
I just came by
for an informal chat.

01:23:01.481 --> 01:23:03.648
Why don't I
buy you a drink?

01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:08.439
Rye.

01:23:09.606 --> 01:23:11.564
Just coffee.

01:23:11.648 --> 01:23:14.564
You sure you don't want
something stiffer?

01:23:14.648 --> 01:23:16.522
Coffee it is.

01:23:22.147 --> 01:23:26.522
County M.E. Does an autopsy
on anyone who dies in custody.

01:23:27.230 --> 01:23:29.480
I don't know
if you knew that.

01:23:29.563 --> 01:23:30.897
It's routine.

01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:36.687
Doesn't become a matter of public record
unless there's been foul play.

01:23:36.771 --> 01:23:38.687
However,

01:23:38.729 --> 01:23:41.854
I don't think I'm prohibited
from telling you this.

01:23:41.979 --> 01:23:44.979
Of course, I'm not
obliged to either.

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:47.062
I just don't know.

01:23:48.062 --> 01:23:50.646
But if I were the man,

01:23:50.729 --> 01:23:53.562
I'd want to be told.

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.521
Told what?

01:24:02.812 --> 01:24:05.770
I'm not here to add to your...

01:24:06.478 --> 01:24:07.644
Thanks.

01:24:19.769 --> 01:24:21.769
Your wife was pregnant.

01:24:23.435 --> 01:24:25.185
First trimester.

01:24:29.185 --> 01:24:31.810
There it is.

01:24:32.602 --> 01:24:34.519
I'm sorry.

01:24:36.976 --> 01:24:40.059
Hell, I hope I've done
the right thing.

01:24:44.643 --> 01:24:49.184
My wife and I had not performed
the sex act in many years.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.017
Well,

01:25:09.516 --> 01:25:12.016
That's really none of my business.

01:25:16.516 --> 01:25:18.016
I'm sorry.

01:25:20.557 --> 01:25:22.182
There it is.

01:25:25.016 --> 01:25:26.849
Good luck, Crane.

01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:47.390
Doris and I had never
really talked much.

01:25:47.515 --> 01:25:50.014
I don't think that's
a bad thing necessarily.

01:25:50.139 --> 01:25:54.514
But it is funny.
Now I wanted to talk.

01:25:54.597 --> 01:25:57.180
Now, with everyone gone,

01:25:57.472 --> 01:26:00.805
I was alone with secrets
I didn't want...

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:03.847
And no one
to tell 'em to anyway.

01:26:05.055 --> 01:26:08.139
I went to see a woman who was supposed
to have powers in communicating...

01:26:08.222 --> 01:26:11.097
With those who had "Passed across",
as she called it.

01:26:11.222 --> 01:26:13.805
She said that people who had passed across
were picky about

01:26:13.889 --> 01:26:15.679
Who they'd communicate with.

01:26:15.763 --> 01:26:18.554
Not like most people
you run into on this side.

01:26:18.638 --> 01:26:23.179
So you needed a guide,
someone with a gift for talking to souls.

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:25.888
Give me your hand.

01:26:30.221 --> 01:26:33.679
Well, first she told me that
my wife was in a peachful place,

01:26:33.763 --> 01:26:35.846
That our souls
were still connected,

01:26:35.971 --> 01:26:38.013
That she'd never
stopped loving me...

01:26:38.138 --> 01:26:41.803
Even though she'd done some things
she wasn't proud of.

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.512
Man, she was reading me
like a book.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:51.094
She was a phony,
just another gabber.

01:26:51.219 --> 01:26:54.177
I was turning into
Ann Nirdlinger,

01:26:54.427 --> 01:26:56.969
Big Dave's wife

01:26:57.052 --> 01:26:59.886
I had to turn my back
on the old lady,

01:27:00.011 --> 01:27:03.636
On the veils, on the ghosts,

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.677
On the dead,

01:27:05.719 --> 01:27:08.511
Before they all sucked me in.

01:27:20.218 --> 01:27:21.718
Ed?

01:27:21.843 --> 01:27:23.968
How are you holding up?

01:27:24.051 --> 01:27:25.926
Okay, Walter.
Thanks.

01:27:27.885 --> 01:27:29.843
I, uh... I was so damn sorry
to hear about your loss.

01:27:29.968 --> 01:27:32.843
A terrible thing.
It's just damn terrible.

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:37.092
Uh, Birdy's upstairs.
I'm on long-distance, so...

01:27:37.217 --> 01:27:38.592
Sure, Walter.

01:27:50.175 --> 01:27:52.008
Hello, Birdy.

01:27:52.966 --> 01:27:54.758
Hi, Mr. Crane.

01:27:56.216 --> 01:27:58.591
We haven't seen you since...

01:28:01.174 --> 01:28:03.424
We've certainly missed you.

01:28:06.008 --> 01:28:08.508
Birdy, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

01:28:11.049 --> 01:28:15.508
There are a lot of things
that haven't worked out for me.

01:28:15.549 --> 01:28:18.674
Life has dealt me some bum cards.

01:28:18.716 --> 01:28:20.674
Or maybe I just haven't played them right.

01:28:20.716 --> 01:28:23.716
Pop doesn't like people
smoking in here.

01:28:29.506 --> 01:28:30.964
I'm sorry.

01:28:31.047 --> 01:28:35.006
Well, sometimes I have a cigarette
when he's away, but never when he's home.

01:28:35.131 --> 01:28:37.672
He can smell it a mile off.

01:28:37.756 --> 01:28:40.589
Well, sure.
It's his house.

01:28:40.714 --> 01:28:43.172
That's what he
keeps telling me.

01:28:44.547 --> 01:28:47.172
Anyway, my point is
you're young,

01:28:47.214 --> 01:28:50.672
A kid, really,
your whole life ahead of you.

01:28:51.922 --> 01:28:56.506
But it's not too soon
to start making opportunities for yourself...

01:28:56.589 --> 01:28:59.505
Before it all washes away.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:06.005
Yeah, I guess.
Pop says so too.

01:29:06.088 --> 01:29:08.130
You know, I work
pretty hard at school.

01:29:08.213 --> 01:29:10.755
That's swell.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.671
However, the music,
if you want to pursue it...

01:29:14.713 --> 01:29:19.670
The lessons from Mrs. Swan,
they'll only take you so far.

01:29:19.712 --> 01:29:22.420
There's this guy
in San Francisco.

01:29:23.212 --> 01:29:25.379
I've made inquiries.

01:29:26.545 --> 01:29:29.669
Everybody says
he's the best.

01:29:29.753 --> 01:29:33.961
Trained people who've gone on to big concert
careers in symphony orchestras, the works.

01:29:34.044 --> 01:29:36.669
His name is Jacques...

01:29:36.711 --> 01:29:38.711
Carcanogues.

01:29:38.753 --> 01:29:41.628
I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right.
Anyway, he's a frenchman.

01:29:41.711 --> 01:29:44.128
- Oh, boy. A frenchman, huh?
- You've got talent.

01:29:45.544 --> 01:29:48.919
Anybody can see that.
And he's the best.

01:29:49.044 --> 01:29:51.669
If he sees a student
that he thinks has talent,

01:29:51.711 --> 01:29:55.044
He takes them on for next to nothing.
So you're a cinch to be accepted.

01:29:55.086 --> 01:29:58.878
I could cover the costs of the lessons.
Like I said, it's pretty modest.

01:29:59.003 --> 01:30:02.168
- Oh, Jeez, Mr. Crane.
- No, I have to do it.

01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:05.668
I can't stand by and watch
any more things go down the drain.

01:30:05.752 --> 01:30:07.793
You're young.
You don't understand.

01:30:07.877 --> 01:30:12.667
Well, Jeez, Mr. Crane.
I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.

01:30:14.084 --> 01:30:16.501
Well, I know you haven't.

01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:21.917
Look, just go see him
as a favor to me.

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:24.042
I talked to this guy.

01:30:24.084 --> 01:30:27.584
He loosened up a little bit
when I told him how talented you were.

01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:29.834
He's agreed to see you
this Saturday.

01:30:31.042 --> 01:30:34.541
He said, uh, maybe you're
a diamond in the rough.

01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:37.041
His words.

01:30:37.125 --> 01:30:39.666
Jeez, I don't know,
Mr. Crane.

01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:44.833
Just go see him
as a favor to me.

01:31:06.874 --> 01:31:08.081
You are the father?

01:31:08.206 --> 01:31:11.539
No, I'm her...
I'm a family friend.

01:31:11.664 --> 01:31:15.664
I am Carcanogues.
You will wait, my dear.

01:31:25.206 --> 01:31:27.039
I speak with you
on the phone, no?

01:31:27.164 --> 01:31:30.789
You have a special interest
in music?

01:31:38.414 --> 01:31:40.705
A music lover,
alors.

01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:44.872
Um, I don't pretend
to be an expert.

01:31:56.787 --> 01:31:58.412
How did she do?

01:31:58.537 --> 01:32:00.746
She seemed like
a very nice girl.

01:32:02.996 --> 01:32:06.662
She play, monsieur,

01:32:06.746 --> 01:32:08.829
Like a very nice girl.

01:32:10.496 --> 01:32:11.621
Stinks.

01:32:11.704 --> 01:32:13.536
Nice girl,

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:15.620
However, stinks.

01:32:16.703 --> 01:32:18.495
Well, I don't understand.

01:32:18.578 --> 01:32:20.661
Is not so hard to understand.

01:32:20.745 --> 01:32:23.870
Her playing, uh,
very polite.

01:32:23.995 --> 01:32:26.161
Did she make mistakes?

01:32:26.411 --> 01:32:28.828
Mistake? No.

01:32:28.911 --> 01:32:31.495
It say "E-flat,"
she play E-flat.

01:32:31.578 --> 01:32:34.870
Ping, ping. She play
the right note always.

01:32:34.995 --> 01:32:37.453
Well, I don't understand.
No mistakes?

01:32:37.536 --> 01:32:40.995
Look, she's just a kid.
I thought you taught these kids to...

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.034
No, no, no, monsieur.
That is what I cannot teach her, huh?
I cannot teach her to have the soul.

01:32:46.534 --> 01:32:48.201
Hmm, voyez, monsieur.
Look.

01:32:49.659 --> 01:32:53.826
To play the piano
is not about the fingers.

01:32:53.909 --> 01:32:55.909
We make with the fingers.

01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:07.659
But the music, monsieur,
she come from I'interieur, from inside, huh?

01:33:08.743 --> 01:33:10.701
The music,

01:33:10.784 --> 01:33:12.868
She starts here.

01:33:12.993 --> 01:33:15.868
She come out through here.

01:33:15.993 --> 01:33:19.450
Hmm?
Then perhaps,

01:33:19.533 --> 01:33:21.033
Perhaps,

01:33:21.158 --> 01:33:23.825
She can go here.

01:33:28.117 --> 01:33:30.867
Like I said,
I'm not an expert.

01:33:30.992 --> 01:33:34.658
So you can listen to me,
for I am expert.

01:33:37.074 --> 01:33:39.824
Voyez, monsieur.
This girl, nice girl.

01:33:39.907 --> 01:33:43.574
Very clever hands.
Nice girl.

01:33:43.699 --> 01:33:46.824
I think, uh,
perhaps some day...

01:33:47.824 --> 01:33:51.490
She can make
very good typist, huh?

01:33:56.948 --> 01:33:58.281
Voila.

01:34:06.698 --> 01:34:09.156
- I stank, didn't I?
- He didn't say that.

01:34:09.448 --> 01:34:11.823
No, but more or less.

01:34:13.698 --> 01:34:15.031
I'm no expert,

01:34:15.073 --> 01:34:17.990
But there must be a dozen teachers
better than this clown.

01:34:18.073 --> 01:34:19.906
- No, look, really...
- More qualified.

01:34:20.031 --> 01:34:21.906
Goddamn phony.

01:34:22.739 --> 01:34:24.155
Really, it's okay.

01:34:24.405 --> 01:34:28.738
I'm not interested in
playing music professionally.

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:31.529
You know, I'm not sure
I want a career at all,

01:34:31.654 --> 01:34:34.154
And if I did, I'd probably
be a veterinarian.

01:34:37.904 --> 01:34:39.988
- Veterinarian.
- Yeah.

01:34:41.779 --> 01:34:44.488
But I-I do appreciate
your interest.

01:34:45.446 --> 01:34:46.988
It was nothing.

01:34:47.113 --> 01:34:52.029
I wish I'd played better for you
'cause I know it would've made you real happy.

01:34:55.903 --> 01:34:57.528
You know what you are?

01:34:59.028 --> 01:35:00.528
What?

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:02.820
You're an enthusiast.

01:35:06.028 --> 01:35:07.653
Yeah, maybe.

01:35:14.612 --> 01:35:18.902
You know, I really do appreciate
the interest you've taken.

01:35:26.527 --> 01:35:28.401
I just wanted to make you happy.

01:35:29.568 --> 01:35:31.651
No, it's really okay.
I wanna do it.

01:35:31.735 --> 01:35:33.110
- Birdy!
- No, it's okay, really.

01:35:33.693 --> 01:35:36.401
Mr. Crane, I wanna do it.
Mr. Crane!

01:35:36.526 --> 01:35:37.985
- Birdy, please don't do that!
- Mr. Crane, please!

01:35:38.068 --> 01:35:40.776
- Heavens to betsy, Birdy!
- Please, Mr. Crane.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.151
Time slow down
right before in accident,

01:35:54.401 --> 01:35:57.360
And I have time
to think about things.

01:35:59.610 --> 01:36:03.150
I thought about what an undertaker
had told me once.

01:36:03.442 --> 01:36:07.150
That your hair keeps growing
for a while, anyway,

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.484
After you die.

01:36:11.649 --> 01:36:13.733
And then it stops.

01:36:18.024 --> 01:36:21.649
I thought,
"What keeps it growing?"

01:36:23.191 --> 01:36:25.858
Is it like a plant in soil?

01:36:27.108 --> 01:36:29.524
What goes out of the soil?

01:36:29.608 --> 01:36:31.149
The soul?

01:36:33.148 --> 01:36:36.148
And when does the hair
realize that it's gone?

01:37:26.688 --> 01:37:27.855
Hello!

01:37:28.855 --> 01:37:31.730
I noticed you still have
pea stone in your driveway.

01:37:32.896 --> 01:37:37.687
Of course you have to rejuvenate
that every couple of years, don't you?
When the pea stone thins out?

01:37:37.812 --> 01:37:40.812
Ha.
Where does it go, huh?

01:37:40.937 --> 01:37:42.770
Like the odd sock.

01:37:42.854 --> 01:37:48.187
'Course, you know where it goes.
You probably pick pieces of it
off your lawn all the time,

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:51.854
Churn it up with your lawn mover,
sweep it off your porch there.

01:37:51.937 --> 01:37:55.603
- Pain in the neck.
- Never bothered me.

01:37:55.686 --> 01:37:57.853
Well, have you ever
considered tar macadam?

01:37:57.936 --> 01:38:00.728
People think it's just for public works
or commercial purposes,

01:38:00.853 --> 01:38:04.019
But we have the technology now
to bring it to the homeowner,

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:06.811
Individual consumer,
at very competitive prices.

01:38:06.894 --> 01:38:11.102
Mind if I show you the specifications?
Afternoon, Ma'am.

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:13.185
What are you selling?

01:38:15.852 --> 01:38:18.768
Ma'am, I was just telling your husband here
about tar macadam.

01:38:18.852 --> 01:38:20.810
For your home driveway here.

01:38:20.893 --> 01:38:24.685
Here's the brochure.
It's the modern way to...

01:38:24.768 --> 01:38:25.810
Get lost.

01:38:41.852 --> 01:38:43.184
Jesus.

01:39:37.431 --> 01:39:39.014
Doris.

01:39:40.639 --> 01:39:43.806
Don't say anything.
I'm fine.

01:40:04.555 --> 01:40:06.013
Crane.

01:40:06.763 --> 01:40:08.180
Mr. Crane?

01:40:10.805 --> 01:40:12.930
Are you there?

01:40:13.013 --> 01:40:14.805
Are you awake?

01:40:16.888 --> 01:40:18.805
He's comin' around.

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:22.846
Can you talk, sir?
These men have to talk to you.

01:40:22.929 --> 01:40:25.679
Are you awake? Sir?

01:40:25.762 --> 01:40:27.971
He's... he's awake.
Go ahead.

01:40:28.096 --> 01:40:29.803
Are you awake?

01:40:29.886 --> 01:40:31.386
Is he awake?

01:40:31.511 --> 01:40:34.803
Crane, as soon as you're conscious,
we have to tell you that...

01:40:34.886 --> 01:40:37.845
- Uh, is he conscious?
- His eyes are open.

01:40:38.678 --> 01:40:40.053
Uh, you're under arrest.

01:40:40.136 --> 01:40:42.511
Soon as the doctor lets us,
we gotta move you.

01:40:42.595 --> 01:40:45.720
Does he understand that?
We're supposed to tell him.
Are you conscious?

01:40:45.845 --> 01:40:49.470
- They'll take you to the prison hospital.
- Under arrest for murder.

01:40:53.969 --> 01:40:56.844
What?
What'd he say?

01:40:56.927 --> 01:41:00.094
Birdy. Uh, the girl.
No, the girl's okay.

01:41:00.177 --> 01:41:01.802
Broken clavicle.

01:41:01.885 --> 01:41:04.135
That's a collarbone, Crane.
It's broken.

01:41:04.385 --> 01:41:05.510
She's okay, though.

01:41:05.635 --> 01:41:09.427
So he understands, then,
he's under arrest for murder?

01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:10.885
- Big Dave.
- Huh?

01:41:12.677 --> 01:41:14.344
What?
What'd he say?

01:41:14.427 --> 01:41:16.135
He said okay.

01:41:16.385 --> 01:41:17.844
Is that what he said?

01:41:19.969 --> 01:41:23.593
You're under arrest for the murder
of Creighton Tolliver.

01:41:23.676 --> 01:41:25.633
You understad that?

01:41:25.717 --> 01:41:27.592
Does he understand?

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:30.883
The pansy.

01:41:33.425 --> 01:41:37.467
A kid diving in a water holeoutside of town
had found his car.

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:39.633
They winched it out...

01:41:39.758 --> 01:41:43.383
And found he'd been beaten,
just like Big Dave said.

01:41:44.842 --> 01:41:46.717
Beaten to death.

01:41:48.967 --> 01:41:53.633
Inside his briefcase
were the partnership papers I'd signed,

01:41:53.717 --> 01:41:56.467
Showing that I'd
given him ten grand.

01:41:57.633 --> 01:42:01.382
For the district attorney,
that made it fall into place.

01:42:01.507 --> 01:42:03.924
I'd gotten Doris
to steal the money.

01:42:04.007 --> 01:42:08.007
The pansy had gotten wise somehow,
so I had to kill him to cover my tracks.

01:42:08.132 --> 01:42:10.632
On the arraignment calendar,

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:12.548
People v. Edward Crane.

01:42:12.673 --> 01:42:13.798
I was in a spot.

01:42:13.881 --> 01:42:16.631
You are charged
in a one-count complaint...

01:42:16.756 --> 01:42:21.465
I called in Freddy Riedenschneider
and signed the house over to him.

01:42:21.548 --> 01:42:23.923
He said he didn't ordinarily
work that cheap,

01:42:24.006 --> 01:42:27.506
But he figured he owed me something
since the last one hadn't played out.

01:42:27.631 --> 01:42:30.131
- How do you now plead?
- We plead not guilty, your honor.

01:42:30.423 --> 01:42:33.630
I tried to tell him the whole story,
but Riedenschneider stopped me.

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:35.672
He said the story
made his head hurt.

01:42:35.755 --> 01:42:39.089
He didn't see any way of using it
without putting me on the hot seat...

01:42:39.172 --> 01:42:42.505
- For the murder of Big Dave.
- Trial date is set for Monday a week.

01:42:44.672 --> 01:42:47.880
He told me not to worry, though.
Said he'd think of something.

01:42:50.089 --> 01:42:53.005
They put me
on 24-hour death watch,

01:42:53.089 --> 01:42:57.964
So that I couldn't cheat justice
like they said my wife had done.

01:42:58.047 --> 01:43:01.005
But in front of the jury,
they had it that Doris was a saint.

01:43:01.130 --> 01:43:04.462
The whole plan had been mine.

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:07.753
I was a svengali
who had forced Doris to join

01:43:07.837 --> 01:43:10.128
My criminal enterprise.

01:43:10.378 --> 01:43:11.920
On and on it went,

01:43:12.003 --> 01:43:16.462
How I'd used Doris,
then let her take the fall.

01:43:16.545 --> 01:43:20.462
That stuff smarted because some of it
was close to being true.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.587
And then it was
Riedenschneider's turn.

01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:37.711
Ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury,
citizens of Santa Rosa,

01:43:37.836 --> 01:43:41.169
We've just heard from the district attorney
a rather lurid description...

01:43:41.419 --> 01:43:43.086
Of a truly despicable man.

01:43:43.169 --> 01:43:47.377
I gotta hand it to him.
He tossed a lot of sand in their eyes,

01:43:47.502 --> 01:43:50.586
He talked about how
I'd lost my place in the universe,

01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:54.794
How I was too ordinary to be
the criminal mastermind...

01:43:54.919 --> 01:43:56.793
The D.A. Made me out to be,

01:43:56.876 --> 01:44:01.793
How there was some greater scheme at work
that the state had yet to unravel.

01:44:01.876 --> 01:44:06.960
And he threw in some of the old truth stuff
he hadn't had the chance to trot out for Doris.

01:44:07.043 --> 01:44:10.500
May at first look at these lines
and see only the chaos
of a work of modern art.

01:44:10.584 --> 01:44:14.667
He told them to look at me,
look at me close.

01:44:14.792 --> 01:44:18.042
That the closer they looked,
the less sense it would all make.

01:44:18.167 --> 01:44:21.667
This human, this barber.

01:44:21.792 --> 01:44:24.959
That I wasn't the kind of guy
to kill a guy,

01:44:25.042 --> 01:44:28.000
That I was the barber,
for Christ's sake.

01:44:28.125 --> 01:44:31.584
I was just like them,
an ordinary man.

01:44:31.667 --> 01:44:35.000
Guilty of living in a world
that had no place for me, yeah.

01:44:35.084 --> 01:44:37.625
Guilty of wanting to be
a dry cleaner, sure.

01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:38.959
But not of murder.

01:44:39.042 --> 01:44:43.124
But most specifically,
this is a barber's dilemma.

01:44:43.416 --> 01:44:45.624
For he is modern man.

01:44:45.708 --> 01:44:47.790
He said I was modern man.

01:44:47.873 --> 01:44:49.707
He is your reflection.

01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:51.332
And if they voted to convict me,

01:44:51.457 --> 01:44:55.332
They'd be practically cinching the noose
around their own necks.

01:44:55.457 --> 01:44:58.790
He told them to look not at the facts,
but at the meaning of the facts.

01:44:58.873 --> 01:45:02.040
And then he said
the facts had no meaning.

01:45:02.165 --> 01:45:05.582
It was a pretty good speech
and even had me going,

01:45:05.665 --> 01:45:07.082
Until Frankie interrupted it.

01:45:10.415 --> 01:45:12.332
What kind of man are you?

01:45:12.457 --> 01:45:15.039
What kind of man are you?

01:45:15.164 --> 01:45:16.872
Move for a mistrial!
Your honor!

01:45:16.956 --> 01:45:18.872
What kind of man are you?

01:45:18.997 --> 01:45:20.456
Move for a mistrial.

01:45:20.581 --> 01:45:23.831
Well, he got his mistrial,
but the well had run dry.

01:45:23.956 --> 01:45:25.872
There was nothing left to mortgage.

01:45:25.997 --> 01:45:30.456
Riedenschneider went home,
and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway,

01:45:30.539 --> 01:45:32.664
Who threw me
on the mercy of the court.

01:45:32.789 --> 01:45:35.539
Your honor,
we plead guilty...

01:45:35.664 --> 01:45:38.830
With extenuating circumstances.

01:45:38.955 --> 01:45:41.496
It was my only chance,
he said.

01:45:41.621 --> 01:45:45.038
I guess that meant
I never had a chance.

01:45:47.495 --> 01:45:52.662
He wasn't buying any of that
modern man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff,

01:45:52.787 --> 01:45:54.495
Or any of the mercy stuff either.

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.870
This man is a menace
to society.

01:45:56.954 --> 01:46:00.454
Nope, he was going
by the book,

01:46:00.579 --> 01:46:03.120
And the book said
I got the chair.

01:46:03.412 --> 01:46:05.870
He has forfeited the right
to his own life.

01:46:05.995 --> 01:46:08.329
So here I am,

01:46:08.454 --> 01:46:10.954
At first I didn't know
how I got here.

01:46:11.037 --> 01:46:13.037
I knew step by step,
of course,

01:46:13.162 --> 01:46:16.745
Which is what I've told you,
step by step.

01:46:16.829 --> 01:46:20.744
But I couldn't see any pattern.

01:46:20.828 --> 01:46:22.453
Now that I'm near the end,

01:46:22.494 --> 01:46:25.536
I'm glad that this men's magazine
paid me to tell my story.

01:46:25.703 --> 01:46:29.161
Writing it has helped me
sort it all out.

01:46:29.411 --> 01:46:31.118
They're paying me
flve cents a word,

01:46:31.368 --> 01:46:33.785
So you'll pardon me if sometimes I've told you
more than you wanted to know.

01:46:35.618 --> 01:46:39.077
But now all the disconnected
things seem to hook up.

01:46:40.118 --> 01:46:42.827
That's the funny thing
about going away,

01:46:42.952 --> 01:46:45.327
Knowing the date
you're going to die.

01:46:46.535 --> 01:46:50.452
And the men's magazine
wanted me to tell how that felt.

01:47:15.826 --> 01:47:19.826
Well, it's like pulling away
from the maze.

01:47:21.492 --> 01:47:24.115
While you're in the maze,
you go throught willy-nilly,

01:47:24.407 --> 01:47:26.865
Turning where you think
you have to turn,

01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:29.032
Banging into the dead ends,

01:47:29.115 --> 01:47:30.990
One thing after another.

01:47:36.615 --> 01:47:38.490
But you get
some distance on it,

01:47:38.615 --> 01:47:40.532
And all those twists
and turns...

01:47:40.657 --> 01:47:44.990
Why, they're the shape
of your life.

01:47:46.907 --> 01:47:48.990
It's hard to explain.

01:47:51.699 --> 01:47:55.074
But seeing it whole
gives you some peace.

01:48:29.029 --> 01:48:32.029
The men's magazine
also asked about remorse.

01:48:32.154 --> 01:48:36.987
Yeah, I guess I'm sorry
about the pain I caused other people.

01:48:38.154 --> 01:48:40.862
But I don't regret anything.

01:48:40.946 --> 01:48:42.862
Not a thing.

01:48:42.946 --> 01:48:44.612
I used to.

01:48:44.696 --> 01:48:47.571
I used to regret
being the barber.

01:49:52.151 --> 01:49:54.984
I don't know
where I'm being taken.

01:49:56.692 --> 01:49:59.567
I don't know what I'll find
beyond the earth and sky,

01:50:00.775 --> 01:50:02.608
But I'm not afraid to go.

01:50:04.108 --> 01:50:07.524
Maybe the things I don't understand
will be clearer there,

01:50:07.607 --> 01:50:09.899
Like when a fog blows away.

01:50:12.649 --> 01:50:14.732
Maybe Doris will be there.

01:50:15.691 --> 01:50:19.357
And maybe there
I can tell her...

01:50:19.482 --> 01:50:21.482
All those things...

01:50:22.524 --> 01:50:25.441
They don't have words for here.
