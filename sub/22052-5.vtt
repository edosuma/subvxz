Are you guys all patients here?

20:30.300 --> 20:33.100
>> KELLY: Um, yes.
>> NOVELYN: I'm Novelyn.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.533
I'm 44 years old.
I've been going to Planned

20:35.533 --> 20:39.367
Parenthood since I was 16.
Last year, um, I found a lump in

20:39.367 --> 20:41.834
my right armpit.
I said, "You know what, I'll go

20:41.834 --> 20:44.834
to Planned Parenthood."
The nurse practitioner gave me

20:44.834 --> 20:50.600
an exam and as soon as she
touched it, I knew.

20:50.600 --> 20:54.166
>> NOVELYN: And she knew.
And she just let me have my

20:54.166 --> 20:59.166
moment, my tears coming down my
face, and, you know, she quickly

20:59.166 --> 21:03.333
sent me to get a mammogram and
an ultrasound and then less than

21:03.333 --> 21:07.367
a week later I was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.667
The compassion that
they gave to me set the tone for

21:10.667 --> 21:15.266
how I was gonna end up fighting
and, you know, 360,000 women get

21:15.266 --> 21:19.233
breast exams here, so... and I
happen to be one of them.

21:19.233 --> 21:21.233
>> KHLOE: Thank you for sharing
your story with us.

21:21.233 --> 21:23.533
>> NOVELYN: Yeah.
>> ADELINE: Um, I'll go next.

21:23.533 --> 21:28.367
I, uh, I'm Adeline. I'm 30.
Four years ago, I found myself

21:28.367 --> 21:32.266
pregnant and I had missed one
pill, as so many women often do

21:32.266 --> 21:34.066
and...
>> KHLOE: That's how she got

21:34.066 --> 21:35.834
pregnant with her first son.
>> ADELINE: Yeah, see?

21:35.834 --> 21:38.066
It happens.
I was in a very new

21:38.066 --> 21:41.033
relationship.
We hardly knew each other and I

21:41.033 --> 21:43.700
was at the peak of my career.
I was travelling a whole lot and

21:43.700 --> 21:45.867
so it just wasn't gonna work for
me.

21:45.867 --> 21:47.867
I scheduled an appointment at
Planned Parenthood to get an

21:47.867 --> 21:51.700
abortion, and I started to have
second thoughts, and when I went

21:51.700 --> 21:55.500
in, the doctor sensed my
hesitation and she's like, "You

21:55.500 --> 21:58.233
are so early in your pregnancy.
Go home. Take the night to

21:58.233 --> 22:00.233
sleep on it."
I actually insisted.

22:00.233 --> 22:02.567
I was like, "I'm already here.
I'm just nervous."

22:02.567 --> 22:05.367
And she didn't budge.
She said, "It's not happening

22:05.367 --> 22:07.033
today.
"My conscience isn't gonna let

22:07.033 --> 22:10.200
me do this, so go home."
Uh, eight months later, I had my

22:10.200 --> 22:13.967
son.
And he's incredible.

22:13.967 --> 22:16.567
He's the coolest little dude.
And I can't imagine my life

22:16.567 --> 22:18.967
without him.
So, had I gone anywhere else

22:18.967 --> 22:22.233
other than Planned Parenthood,
he wouldn't be here today.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.333
>> KIM: The perception of
Planned Parenthood is that it's

22:24.333 --> 22:27.967
this, like, abortion clinic.
That's nothing like what it's

22:27.967 --> 22:30.967
like.
Hearing that firsthand really

22:30.967 --> 22:33.400
made it real for me.
>> KOURTNEY: Hearing the stories

22:33.400 --> 22:37.200
for sure was eye-opening.
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.066
>> KELLY: Uh, I started, um,
dating my best guy friend when I

22:40.066 --> 22:43.433
was 23.
And he and I stopped using

22:43.433 --> 22:46.066
protection without getting
tested first.

22:46.066 --> 22:48.433
And I was like, "That was a
silly decision.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.734
Like, we should go get tested
and just make sure everything is

22:50.734 --> 22:52.500
okay."
We didn't have an appointment.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.900
We just walked in.
And he got pulled to the back

22:54.900 --> 22:57.233
first.
And it was, like, a 15-minute

22:57.233 --> 22:59.300
test where they prick your
finger and then it takes 15

22:59.300 --> 23:00.700
minutes to get results.
>> KOURTNEY: So, they could tell

23:00.700 --> 23:02.066
that fast?
>> KELLY: Yeah.

23:02.066 --> 23:03.667
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, wow.
>> KELLY: And so he came back

23:03.667 --> 23:06.633
out 15 minutes later with pieces
of paper in his hands.

23:06.633 --> 23:13.233
Um, and he was like, he said, "I
tested positive for HIV."

23:13.233 --> 23:15.033
>> KELLY: And I was, like, on my
phone.

23:15.033 --> 23:17.567
I was like... (scoffs)
"Yeah, okay. Whatever."

23:17.567 --> 23:20.834
And he didn't say anything.
And I grabbed the pieces of

23:20.834 --> 23:26.367
paper from him and I saw that
there was information about HIV.

23:26.367 --> 23:29.433
In my mind, I was like, "There
is no way that I don't have

23:29.433 --> 23:32.300
this.
Like, I-I-I have this."

23:32.300 --> 23:35.734
Um, they took me back and they
pricked my finger.

23:35.734 --> 23:38.533
At the moment, I was like, "This
is the longest 15 minutes of my

23:38.533 --> 23:42.000
life."
15 minutes later, they took us

23:42.000 --> 23:48.433
both back and told us that we
both had tested positive.

23:48.433 --> 23:51.200
>> KIM: Whoa.
>> KELLY: Planned Parenthood,

23:51.200 --> 23:54.033
like, they were compassionate
and understanding, and they told

23:54.033 --> 23:56.900
me, "You know, your life isn't
over, okay?

23:56.900 --> 23:59.333
This is manageable.
You can live a normal life with

23:59.333 --> 24:02.533
this."
Planned Parenthood basically

24:02.533 --> 24:05.867
kept me alive.
>> KHLOE: I'm a big fan of

24:05.867 --> 24:08.266
Planned Parenthood now.
Meeting all the girls and

24:08.266 --> 24:10.633
hearing their stories, and
seeing how many women have been

24:10.633 --> 24:15.567
helped by some of the services
they have to offer, I-I mean, I

24:15.567 --> 24:17.633
think people need to be more
educated before they form

24:17.633 --> 24:20.333
opinions, and that's what I'm
grateful that I had the

24:20.333 --> 24:23.567

It's really intense.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.767

It's not as intense as you
