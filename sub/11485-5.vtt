00:14.831 --> 00:16.696
Never mix tequila and scotch.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.833
Morning, Uncle Charlie.

00:20.403 --> 00:21.734
Jake, buddy.

00:21.871 --> 00:24.339
Dad said you'd never get
up to go to soccer with me.

00:24.407 --> 00:26.773
But I said, he promised. So he was wrong.

00:34.617 --> 00:35.845
What?

00:38.088 --> 00:41.421
You know, most of the parents wear
shorts and lots of sunscreen,

00:41.524 --> 00:43.082
but that's another way to go.

00:44.227 --> 00:47.355
Alan, I can't go to a soccer game.
I just got home from Vegas.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.958
You went out last night to return a video.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.362
I ran into a friend of mine who was
getting married at the Bellagio.

00:55.438 --> 00:56.803
That explains the tuxedo.

01:02.078 --> 01:04.706
No, I think this was
for something else entirely.

01:06.082 --> 01:08.243
I'm sure I'll read about it in the paper.

01:09.119 --> 01:12.919
I am the Soccer Snack Buddy this week,
so I've gotta stop at the grocery store.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.083
Why don't you ride to the game
with Jake when the van gets here?

01:16.159 --> 01:17.490
I got a better idea.

01:17.627 --> 01:21.154
Why don't I go upstairs, throw up
and sleep in my clothes for 12 hours?

01:21.264 --> 01:23.630
Fine, but if you're not gonna come,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.766
- you gotta tell Jake yourself.
- Fine. He'll understand.

01:30.306 --> 01:32.501
- Jake?
- I got new cleats.

01:35.178 --> 01:38.614
Nice. Listen, Jake, buddy.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.110
Have you ever been to Vegas?

01:48.258 --> 01:50.317
So you're the infamous Uncle Charlie.

01:51.661 --> 01:53.128
I've heard about you.

02:03.940 --> 02:07.432
Everybody out. Watch your heads.
One at a time.

02:07.510 --> 02:09.273
- Party time.
- Come on.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.248
Here's the deal, Uncle Charlie.
I find you attractive.

02:18.321 --> 02:20.482
I have three kids,
a bastard of an ex-husband,

02:20.557 --> 02:22.650
I work 50 hours a week
at my own travel agency,

02:22.725 --> 02:24.192
I'm at the peak of my sexuality,

02:24.260 --> 02:27.661
I have a three-hour window Wednesdays
when the kids are at tae kwon do.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.191
You in or out?

02:30.800 --> 02:35.328
I'm sorry, I'm terminally hung over
and I just took a cleat in the groin.

02:36.339 --> 02:39.638
E- mail me. Allaboardgloria @aol. com.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.408
So, which one's yours?

02:51.154 --> 02:52.746
Please don't make me talk.

02:54.724 --> 02:57.557
This is Charlie Harper.
Alan Harper's brother.

03:02.365 --> 03:04.560
- So, who's winning?
- No one.

03:05.068 --> 03:08.799
We don't keep score. We think
it's healthier if the kids just play for fun.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.872
You're yanking me, right?

03:12.909 --> 03:14.968
Judith warned us that you were a pistol.

03:15.712 --> 03:18.545
By the way, we were so sorry
to hear about her and Alan.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.912
So tell us, is it true?

03:19.983 --> 03:22.451
Did Judith leave your
brother for another woman?

03:22.785 --> 03:25.777
- Why don't you ask Judith?
- We wouldn't want to pry.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.290
Ladies, if you'll excuse me,

03:31.361 --> 03:35.024
I have to go because,
hell, I don't need a reason.

03:37.867 --> 03:39.698
Someone's a little full of himself.

03:39.936 --> 03:42.530
Forget him. His brother's
the one who's in play.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.766
How's Jake doing?

03:44.874 --> 03:48.366
Jake's fine. He's 10.
He's got his whole life ahead of him.

03:48.945 --> 03:50.344
Me, on the other hand,

03:50.413 --> 03:53.871
I'm sitting in the hot sun,
in rented pants listening to myself blink.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.551
I'll ask somebody else.

04:02.225 --> 04:03.419
What?

04:03.760 --> 04:07.252
Sorry. I couldn't help
overhearing, and you just look so

04:08.932 --> 04:10.126
pathetic.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.326
Really? The guy at the
tux shop said I looked dashing.

04:14.771 --> 04:16.398
Of course, that was yesterday.

04:16.572 --> 04:18.733
And I found his phone
number in my pocket.

04:19.575 --> 04:22.806
- What was the occasion?
- Just returning a video.

04:23.313 --> 04:25.747
- Charlie Harper.
- Kate McLaughlin.

04:26.582 --> 04:28.743
Let me ask you something,
Kate McLaughlin.

04:28.952 --> 04:32.251
What's your take on this
whole no-keeping-score thing?

04:32.488 --> 04:34.854
I think it's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

04:36.759 --> 04:39.626
Can I stay here next
to you where it's safe?

04:39.829 --> 04:40.989
Sure.

04:42.632 --> 04:43.997
So, which one's yours?

04:45.001 --> 04:47.663
Number nine. But I'm not the father.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.028
Aren't you a good sport?

04:54.277 --> 04:55.801
Jake, for the last time,

04:55.878 --> 04:58.813
nobody got "creamed. "
No one won, no one lost.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.315
Yeah. Except for us. 12-2.

05:03.052 --> 05:06.954
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
It's whether or not you beat the spread.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.951
Thank you, Charlie.
Jake, go take a shower.

05:12.829 --> 05:15.992
Charlie, we are trying to teach
the kids not to keep score.

05:16.132 --> 05:18.862
You should've thought of that
before you taught them to count.

05:20.370 --> 05:23.464
By the way, what are you doing
with Jake tomorrow?

05:23.539 --> 05:24.836
I don't know. Why?

05:24.907 --> 05:28.206
I made a play date for him with
one of the kids from the game.

05:28.544 --> 05:30.671
You're hitting on the mother, aren't you?

05:31.547 --> 05:33.208
Can't slip one past you, can I?

05:33.883 --> 05:36.215
That's not what a play date is for.

05:36.552 --> 05:39.919
What? The kid plays,
I have a date. Everybody wins.

05:40.723 --> 05:42.486
- Everybody wins?
- Yes.

05:42.892 --> 05:44.826
But I promise not to keep score.

05:45.361 --> 05:48.091
Charlie, you cannot use my son
to pick up single mothers.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.724
But I can.

05:51.401 --> 05:52.891
Good night, Snack Buddy.

05:54.070 --> 05:56.971
No going in the water,
no throwing rocks, and remember,

05:57.040 --> 05:59.008
if you can't see us, we can't see you.

05:59.409 --> 06:01.536
Is there anything you'd
like to add, Charlie?

06:01.611 --> 06:04.205
- Why can't they throw rocks?
- Go.

06:06.082 --> 06:08.846
Ernie loves the beach.
Thanks for inviting him.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.681
Anything for the kids. They're our future.

06:13.356 --> 06:15.551
- So, where's Alan?
- I sent him to the movies.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.061
He deserves a break, and I get
some quality uncle time with Jake.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.221
I think that is really nice of you.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.595
Ernie, keep your socks with your shoes.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.395
I'm sorry, where was I?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.698
You were saying
I was nice about something.

06:28.438 --> 06:30.736
How long have you lived
in Sherman Oaks?

06:31.107 --> 06:33.940
We moved in and...
Ernie, put that down, it's dead.

06:34.577 --> 06:37.546
That kid'll pick up anything,
no matter what it looks like.

06:37.613 --> 06:38.773
Been there.

06:40.450 --> 06:42.782
We moved in just in time
for the earthquake...

06:42.919 --> 06:45.387
Ernie, I am not gonna say it again.

06:45.555 --> 06:48.080
Put the dead thing down.

06:49.058 --> 06:51.822
Jake, you should probably
put your dead thing down, too.

06:54.097 --> 06:56.327
- Kids.
- I know. They're just...

06:56.432 --> 06:58.798
Ernie, put it down
or we're leaving right now.

06:59.335 --> 07:03.169
I'm counting to three. One, two...

07:03.272 --> 07:05.638
Ernie, for God's sake,
you're killing me here.

07:06.275 --> 07:08.243
- Thank you.
- No problem.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.779
- So, did you grow up in L. A?
- No.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.441
My dad was in the Army
so we moved around...

07:13.516 --> 07:15.279
Hell, that thing's not dead.

07:15.418 --> 07:18.581
I'd like to get to know you,
it's not gonna happen on a play date.

07:18.654 --> 07:20.849
- Ask me out sometime?
- That's a really good...

07:20.957 --> 07:23.949
Are you happy?
I told you to put it down, Ernie.

07:24.827 --> 07:27.762
Get the sand off of it. No. Don't touch it.

07:28.297 --> 07:30.925
- What night's good for you?
- Jake, you're not helping.

07:40.176 --> 07:42.804
- Don't wait up.
- Back to Vegas?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.442
Even better. Sherman Oaks.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.945
The gateway to Van Nuys.

07:51.154 --> 07:52.314
Kate again?

07:52.388 --> 07:54.856
You have no clue
what you're getting involved in

07:54.957 --> 07:57.118
- with these divorced soccer moms.
- You're right.

07:57.193 --> 08:00.287
I don't have a clue. I've never had a clue.
It's part of my charm.

08:01.197 --> 08:04.291
At least keep in mind that all
these women talk to each other.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.562
So anything you do
will get back to my wife,

08:06.669 --> 08:08.398
and somehow become my fault.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.338
That doesn't seem fair.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.407
So, where are you going?

08:15.511 --> 08:18.173
I'm helping Gloria with
the soccer league newsletter.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.977
I'm thinking of calling it "Just For Kicks. "

08:22.351 --> 08:24.979
This is the same Gloria
who drives the kid van?

08:25.054 --> 08:27.522
- Yeah. Why?
- Nothing. Have fun.

08:29.692 --> 08:31.319
Talk about not having a clue.

08:34.496 --> 08:36.488
And I designed a logo,

08:36.999 --> 08:40.058
the "K" in "Kicks" is a little foot.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.895
Sounds wonderful.

08:42.337 --> 08:45.330
I can't thank you enough
for taking the time to do this.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.773
Anything for the kids.

08:48.511 --> 08:50.376
You're such a good father.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.846
It's a shame that Judith
didn't appreciate you.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.707
She just needed
a little time to sort things out.

08:55.918 --> 08:58.614
But, yeah. It's a shame.

08:59.755 --> 09:01.188
Look at you.

09:01.257 --> 09:05.250
A successful chiropractor,
intelligent, dedicated.

09:05.595 --> 09:07.028
You're embarrassing me.

09:08.264 --> 09:09.754
I'm sorry.

09:10.099 --> 09:13.296
Let's get back to your little logo.

09:16.906 --> 09:19.568
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.940
It's my neck. I must have slept wrong.

09:23.145 --> 09:26.376
Make an appointment with my office,
we'll see if we can fix that.

09:26.449 --> 09:28.246
No, I'd feel funny.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.379
We know each other.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.047
Don't be silly. It's what I do.

09:34.557 --> 09:36.320
Turn around. Go ahead.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.060
- Are you getting enough calcium?
- I guess.

09:43.132 --> 09:45.396
It's really important for a woman your age.

09:47.703 --> 09:49.796
Osteoporosis is a real problem.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.601
Curvature of the spine.

09:53.042 --> 09:55.306
Last thing you want
is to wind up with a hump.

09:59.248 --> 10:01.478
I hope you didn't start without me.

10:09.592 --> 10:12.561
- What are you talking about?
- Bill, you did this on purpose.

10:12.628 --> 10:14.892
You showed up late
so you could snoop on me.

10:14.964 --> 10:18.331
- You got to meet my girlfriend.
- What meet? She was our babysitter.

10:20.269 --> 10:21.964
Will you get out of here, Bill?

10:22.071 --> 10:24.733
Kate, I'm trying.
Ernie, would you put your shoes on?

10:38.688 --> 10:40.622
- Bill.
- Charlie.

10:48.297 --> 10:49.594
That your Jag?

10:51.133 --> 10:53.294
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

10:57.273 --> 10:59.605
I got the Navigator over there.

11:01.977 --> 11:03.137
That's nice, too.

11:04.180 --> 11:05.670
Let's go, Dad.

11:10.119 --> 11:13.520
All right, then.
You try and make her happy.

11:18.461 --> 11:21.624
Truthfully, I think
that my ex was intimidated

11:21.697 --> 11:23.824
by my sexual...

11:24.467 --> 11:27.027
I don't even know, how to say it. Appetite.

11:32.541 --> 11:36.307
So we're agreed we'll set aside
six inches for the editorial column?

11:37.179 --> 11:39.477
I'm sorry. Yes, six inches.

11:40.049 --> 11:42.176
I don't know how I got so off-topic.

11:42.685 --> 11:44.880
I know exactly how you got off-topic.

11:46.222 --> 11:49.680
I think the next piece of business
is to decide on the paper color.

11:50.059 --> 11:51.993
I brought some samples. We've got

11:52.061 --> 11:55.155
goldenrod, salmon, mustard...

11:55.231 --> 11:57.358
You had me at goldenrod.

11:59.268 --> 12:01.031
Everybody has you at goldenrod.

12:05.574 --> 12:08.509
My brother, Alan, warned me
not to go out with you tonight.

12:08.577 --> 12:09.839
That's funny.

12:09.912 --> 12:12.073
Everybody warned me
not to go out with you.

12:13.082 --> 12:15.073
It worked for Romeo and Juliet,

12:16.218 --> 12:18.413
up until the poison and the stabbing.

12:19.955 --> 12:21.616
Charlie, I have a confession.

12:22.091 --> 12:25.549
I haven't been out with a man other
than my husband in 12 years.

12:26.128 --> 12:27.425
That's not a problem.

12:27.530 --> 12:30.226
A couple of things have changed,
I can bring you up to date.

12:30.299 --> 12:31.459
Please do.

12:31.767 --> 12:35.362
All right, well, nowadays,
women pay for dinner.

12:38.774 --> 12:40.901
And of course, sex is a given.

12:42.378 --> 12:44.972
I'll tell you one thing,
I am not paying for dinner.

12:45.714 --> 12:46.976
Rats.

12:50.619 --> 12:53.247
Look at the time.
Maybe we should get going.

12:53.322 --> 12:55.916
Give Gloria a chance
for a little quiet time before

12:55.991 --> 12:57.618
her many, many kids come home.

12:58.894 --> 13:01.385
I don't need any quiet time.

13:01.464 --> 13:02.590
Don't be silly.

13:02.665 --> 13:04.599
Alan, would you mind driving me home?

13:04.667 --> 13:06.157
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

13:06.302 --> 13:08.998
A little tipsy? How about a little obvious?

13:09.672 --> 13:12.402
- I'm sorry?
- Could I talk to you for a minute?

13:12.475 --> 13:14.466
- It is getting a little late.
- Sit down.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.777
We'll be right back.

13:19.982 --> 13:21.973
I think she's going through the change.

13:24.286 --> 13:26.186
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

13:26.288 --> 13:28.119
He's in play. I'm playing.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.454
I'm the one who told you he's in play.

13:30.526 --> 13:33.359
Please. I told you two years ago
that marriage was toast.

13:33.929 --> 13:35.191
So what?

13:35.464 --> 13:37.864
He's in my house
on tae kwon do Wednesday,

13:37.967 --> 13:40.197
and I don't have time to
mess around with you.

13:40.302 --> 13:42.133
Why don't we just let him decide?

13:42.438 --> 13:43.871
Let him decide?

13:44.006 --> 13:46.497
He still thinks we're doing
a soccer newsletter.

13:48.611 --> 13:51.808
- You don't even like him, do you?
- He's okay.

13:53.482 --> 13:55.109
He's here and it's Wednesday.

13:57.052 --> 13:58.713
I happen to think he's hot.

13:58.888 --> 14:01.152
You wouldn't know
what to do with a hot guy.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.154
Yeah? Well, watch me.

14:08.797 --> 14:10.788
Great. You broke him.

14:13.636 --> 14:16.867
The biggest surprise was how
much I loved having him around.

14:16.972 --> 14:18.633
I mean, Jake's amazing.

14:18.841 --> 14:22.971
Do you know I have, on occasion,
actually put his needs ahead of my own?

14:25.481 --> 14:28.075
Like going to a soccer game
at 8:00 am on a Saturday?

14:28.183 --> 14:29.207
Yes.

14:29.318 --> 14:32.344
At 8:00 am, I can barely get out
of bed to go to the bathroom.

14:33.255 --> 14:35.746
What you're saying
is having a child in your life

14:35.858 --> 14:37.883
totally changes the way
you look at things.

14:37.993 --> 14:39.483
Exactly.

14:41.196 --> 14:43.323
Of course, you probably
know that already.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.360
But I like that you know it.

14:47.736 --> 14:50.398
- I had a really great time.
- Me, too.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.501
- Can we do this again?
- I would love that.

14:53.909 --> 14:55.035
Great.

15:08.090 --> 15:11.355
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

15:12.761 --> 15:14.422
Please don't tell Alan's wife.

15:16.532 --> 15:19.194
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

15:19.935 --> 15:21.402
I really like you.

15:25.074 --> 15:26.803
Okay. This is new for me.

15:29.278 --> 15:30.540
It's just...

15:31.847 --> 15:33.678
Charlie, I have a 10-year-old son.

15:33.916 --> 15:36.282
I have two mortgages,
private school bills,

15:36.352 --> 15:39.048
a full-time job, custody battles,
alimony battles,

15:39.121 --> 15:43.353
child support battles,
car pools and drum lessons.

15:45.260 --> 15:47.023
How can we possibly do this again?

15:48.097 --> 15:50.395
You bought a 10-year-old a drum set?

15:53.102 --> 15:55.730
Don't change the subject.
You know what I'm saying.

15:57.239 --> 16:00.766
Do you really want to be involved in this?

16:03.245 --> 16:05.611
I hadn't really thought that far ahead.

16:06.982 --> 16:08.210
Exactly.

16:10.319 --> 16:13.220
All right. I guess I'll see you around.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.922
Where are you going?

16:17.459 --> 16:19.290
- Home.
- Why?

16:19.962 --> 16:22.988
I said we couldn't do it again.
That doesn't mean we can't

16:23.732 --> 16:25.063
do it tonight.

16:30.806 --> 16:33.400
Boy, you really don't have a clue,
do you, Charlie?

16:33.842 --> 16:35.173
No.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.807
But it seems to be working for me.

16:50.793 --> 16:51.987
Morning.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.166
Regular or decaf?

17:02.004 --> 17:03.995
- Regular.
- Thank God.

17:16.218 --> 17:17.685
Aren't you even curious?

17:18.787 --> 17:21.278
- You went to Gloria's last night.
- Yeah.

17:21.656 --> 17:23.021
I can fill in the blanks.

17:31.366 --> 17:32.890
We're getting killed.

17:33.902 --> 17:36.393
We're here for fun, right?
Nobody wins or loses.

17:36.505 --> 17:39.235
Come on. Somebody always loses.

17:41.009 --> 17:42.306
Who are we kidding?

17:42.578 --> 17:45.376
It's 8-1 out there, and
everybody here knows it.

17:46.048 --> 17:48.209
And you know, I'll tell you another thing.

17:48.717 --> 17:51.208
We haven't won a game all season.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.513
And I'll put that in the newsletter.

17:54.022 --> 17:56.388
And as God as my witness,

17:57.226 --> 17:59.319
there will be a newsletter!

18:01.230 --> 18:03.698
Dad, you're kind of freaking
everybody out here.

18:05.868 --> 18:09.065
Forget it, Jake. It's Sherman Oaks.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.894
English

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
