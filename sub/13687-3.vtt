{\an1}The situation
with you and him

15:20.753 --> 15:22.488
{\an1}is not as bad
as it could be.

15:22.554 --> 15:23.822

15:22.554 --> 15:23.822

I do not want to have
a conversation with Simon.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.929
{\an8}But it's like, okay,
if we wanna get him out

15:30.996 --> 15:33.666
{\an8}of the house quicker,
then just have a conversation.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.234
{\an8}So if this is what it takes,

15:35.301 --> 15:37.202
{\an8}I'm gonna chat with him,
and he needs to go.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.704

15:38.771 --> 15:40.406
Simon, are you
available to talk

15:40.472 --> 15:41.507
or not available?

15:41.573 --> 15:43.275
Uh, yeah, I'm available.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.045
I think we did
God's work today.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.746
{\an5}I did God's work.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.746
{\an3}And I think

15:47.813 --> 15:48.947
that I deserve good karma.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.916
{\an1}Stop eating.
You always eat.

15:50.983 --> 15:52.584
{\an1}You can take a break
from eating.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.754
{\an1}So you are
apologizing for what?

15:55.821 --> 15:57.456
So, I mean,
there's a couple things.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.159
You can do a full sentence.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.860
{\an5}If I can't talk to you
and you're not in
an open space

16:01.927 --> 16:03.629

then this conversation's

16:03.696 --> 16:05.764
gonna go nowhere,
you know?

16:05.831 --> 16:07.333
Both of us
went through a lot,

16:07.399 --> 16:09.201
{\an1}and there was a lot of fight
and a lot of tension,

16:09.268 --> 16:11.804
especially around Sophia
when we did fight.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.038
Stuff that she shouldn't
have seen,

16:13.105 --> 16:14.440
me and you arguing and...

16:14.506 --> 16:16.175
{\an5}Acting like you know...

16:14.506 --> 16:16.175
I know you pretty good.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.210
{\an5}No, you don't.

I'm not here

16:18.277 --> 16:20.512

16:18.277 --> 16:20.512
I do know you
really well.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.949
{\an4}No, you know me
when you were around
and you frustrated me,

16:24.016 --> 16:25.451
{\an5}you aggravated me...

16:24.016 --> 16:25.451
Let's not ge--

16:25.517 --> 16:27.419
{\an5}Don't involve yourself.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.419
I'm not here
to argue with you.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.921
{\an5}We had full-on conversa--

16:27.486 --> 16:28.921
If you want drama,
that's up to you.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.356
{\an5}Okay, so then don't--

16:28.987 --> 16:30.356
I don't need to hear it,

16:30.422 --> 16:32.091
{\an5}I can just walk away...

16:30.422 --> 16:32.091
So don't call my father--

16:32.157 --> 16:34.093
{\an5}Nobody called your father.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.093
Yes, you did.

Your father just
messaged me the other day,

16:35.561 --> 16:36.895
{\an5}you wanna see the texts?

16:35.561 --> 16:36.895
I don't care.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.765
{\an6}Okay.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.765
{\an1}Don't involve yourself
with my family.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.567
Okay, then have him not
reach out to me then.

16:41.633 --> 16:44.403
{\an5}(Simon)
I genuinely came here
to make my peace with Farrah,

16:44.470 --> 16:47.005
{\an8}but she doesn't want to listen
because she always wants

16:47.072 --> 16:48.774
{\an8}to point the finger
at the other person.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.175
{\an5}Bad, negative call.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.175
I wish I had a mirror

talking right now.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.780
{\an1}Good, and I would actually
be happier looking at me

16:54.847 --> 16:56.982

Right.

my energy on him.

Huh.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.799

According to Cory,

With elimination coming,

20:21.520 --> 20:23.555
it looks like Kareem needs

20:23.622 --> 20:25.657
on Maya's good side
and apologize,

20:25.724 --> 20:27.859

20:32.965 --> 20:34.733

And Farrah's tagging along too

20:34.800 --> 20:37.169

20:48.580 --> 20:50.449

I opened up to Murray

20:50.515 --> 20:52.517

Like, please, just
keep this between us."

20:57.956 --> 21:00.792
{\an1}My teammate told me she had
something that was incurable.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.895
Why would you share any
of that information

21:03.962 --> 21:05.330
other than to Maya?

21:05.397 --> 21:06.898
I don't know.
To be honest,

21:06.965 --> 21:08.600
it was like, one of those
spur of the moment things.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.102
Like, I was in my feelings.

21:10.168 --> 21:13.472
Can you say "I apologize
for bringing up something

21:13.538 --> 21:15.807
"I should not be
bringing up to others

21:15.874 --> 21:17.509
"in any circumstance,
way, shape, or form,

21:17.576 --> 21:20.779
and I would not want you
to do that to me?"

21:20.846 --> 21:23.615
Mm-hmm, I just
wanna say sorry.

21:23.682 --> 21:26.451
Um, I (bleep) up big time.

21:26.518 --> 21:30.522
{\an1}If you cared or whatever
you tried to say about me,

21:30.589 --> 21:32.391
{\an1}that's something that
would've never got brought up.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.959
And I just expected better.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.694
{\an8}I don't wanna leave
a bitter taste

21:35.761 --> 21:37.729
{\an8}in anybody's (bleep) mouth
about me.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.631
Like, you know,
you can say I'm not perfect,

21:39.698 --> 21:40.966
but you can say
at the end of the day,

21:41.033 --> 21:43.035
I admitted to spreading
false rumors.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.570
You know I love you
and I do apologize.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.706
{\an5}I sincerely mean that though.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.706
{\an1}Thank you.

30:08.273 --> 30:09.908
{\an8}He's always gonna have a big
beep-beep. Like, you know?

30:09.974 --> 30:11.643
{\an8}And the sex
is always gonna be great.

30:11.709 --> 30:15.046
But do I wanna go ahead
and just give it to him

30:15.113 --> 30:17.649
because I'm sexually frustrated
and I'm horny?

30:17.715 --> 30:19.617
No, 'cause I've made
those mistakes before,

30:19.684 --> 30:21.653
and I regret it right after.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.956
{\an1}You (bleep) with a girl
that's below me?

30:25.023 --> 30:27.825
{\an1}And I don't get jealous,
I just cut you off.

30:27.892 --> 30:30.094
{\an4}I've never been the type
to feel like I have
to fight for somebody.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.130
So even-- yeah,
I don't compete.

30:32.197 --> 30:34.132
{\an5}And if I'm gonna
ever "compete,"
it's gonna be with

30:34.199 --> 30:36.434
a bitch that's better.
I'ma compete with Beyoncé

30:36.501 --> 30:39.370
before I ever compete
with like, a Michelle.

30:39.437 --> 30:44.676
{\an8}Diandra, Malcolm,
is there unfinished business?
A spark? Whatever?

30:44.742 --> 30:47.645
I just feel like Malcolm
really chose the wrong person.

30:47.712 --> 30:50.648
I hate thirsty, desperate,
clingy girls.

30:50.715 --> 30:52.750
Diandra, you gotta go, sis.
Your time's up, sweetie.

30:52.817 --> 30:56.454
And I mean this with
sincerity and all heart,

30:56.521 --> 30:58.056
there's no reason
for you to be here.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.058

{\an5}an "ex-it" strategy,
because one of you
is going home.

31:40.331 --> 31:42.700
{\an1}So I know originally
I had said that

31:42.767 --> 31:43.935
I wanted Kareem out, right?

31:44.002 --> 31:46.904
{\an6}Okay.

I kinda feel like
with Kareem,

31:48.773 --> 31:50.208
{\an8}I do hate in some sorta way

31:50.275 --> 31:51.542
{\an8}because he was
a piece of (bleep)

31:51.609 --> 31:52.610
{\an8}for what he did to me.

{\an8}there's unfinished business
on that end,

31:55.747 --> 31:59.284
{\an8}so I do feel like in some
sort of way, Kareem should stay.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.885
Like honestly,
you would think

32:00.952 --> 32:03.154
that I would be like,
"Cory needs to go."

32:03.221 --> 32:05.356
{\an4}(Maya)
Yeah.

32:03.221 --> 32:05.356
(Cheyenne)
No, like, actually,

32:05.423 --> 32:06.724
I'm fine with him here.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.724
{\an1}Okay.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.826
I mean, he's... he's...

32:08.893 --> 32:10.928
he's perfectly fine,
for now.

32:10.995 --> 32:12.430
{\an8}You know what?
I'm impervious

32:12.497 --> 32:15.066
{\an8}to exes coming in
and messing up

32:15.133 --> 32:16.634
my trust with Murray.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.269
What we got is golden,

32:18.336 --> 32:21.572
{\an8}and I feel confident that we're
going to carry this out.

32:21.639 --> 32:23.908
{\an8}So try me, bitch.

32:23.975 --> 32:25.243
Simon, I'm okay with him.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.679
I know Farrah hates him,
but he don't bother me.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.547
I actually enjoy
Didi's company.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.282
I think she's g--
she's good people.

32:31.349 --> 32:34.118
She's fun. I understand
where you come from,

32:34.185 --> 32:37.088
your perspective on that
is completely accurate.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.990
{\an5}Either way, she's gone.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.990
Right.

32:39.057 --> 32:42.327
So... I was just trying
to keep you in the loop

32:42.393 --> 32:44.429
{\an1}so that you wouldn't be
surprised come elimination.

32:44.495 --> 32:46.798
I wanna know what
they're talking about.

32:46.864 --> 32:47.932
I still think you have time

32:47.999 --> 32:49.834
{\an1}to figure (bleep) out
with Farrah.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.337
Day by day, chisel, chisel.

32:52.403 --> 32:54.305
{\an8}I don't really know where my
loyalty lies with any of them.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.475
I don't know like,
this house is a goddamn mess.

32:57.542 --> 33:00.178
{\an8}I just might burn a vote
on somebody random,

33:00.244 --> 33:02.513
{\an8}or crush somebody
and just flip it all.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.817
{\an5}So what do you want though?

33:02.580 --> 33:05.817
Didi gone.

33:05.883 --> 33:09.921
{\an5}Vote Didi, one, two...

33:05.883 --> 33:09.921
So what we gonna
do about-- okay.

33:09.987 --> 33:12.090
{\an5}(Maya)
Simon don't bother me.
I'm sorry, he don't.

33:09.987 --> 33:12.090
He don't bother me either.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.859
{\an5}He's like...

33:12.156 --> 33:14.859
{\an4}(Morgan)
I just don't think he's
a priority right now.

33:14.926 --> 33:15.960
{\an5}No, he's not.

33:14.926 --> 33:15.960
Like, he can go...

33:16.027 --> 33:18.329
Like literally,
you can leave.

33:18.396 --> 33:22.333
{\an8}So the house is so split
between Diandra and Simon.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.502
Just keep Simon.
Simon doesn't do anything.

33:24.569 --> 33:28.306
{\an5}He sits on the couch
and sleeps all day long,
just like Farrah.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.975
{\an8}I think Diandra is out of here,
but it doesn't even matter

33:31.042 --> 33:32.643
{\an8}because I'm not voting
for either.

33:32.710 --> 33:35.446

Things aren't looking
so good for Farrah.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.316
Simon may be around longer
than she can tolerate,

33:38.383 --> 33:41.185
which was ever since
he showed up.

33:41.252 --> 33:43.454
(Farrah)
He needed closure, I don't.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.490
{\an1}Goodbye. He's not growing
from the experience.

33:45.556 --> 33:47.358
Kareem is growing from
the experience,

33:47.425 --> 33:48.926
so is Didi
from the experience.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.430
{\an1}Does your ex really bother
you that she's here?

33:52.497 --> 33:54.432
Hell no, I don't even
think she should go.

33:54.499 --> 33:57.101
I don't think she even
tries to bother anyone.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.703
{\an1}I've said from day one,
I don't want

33:58.770 --> 34:01.706
any of my exes in here.
I don't change my mind,

34:01.773 --> 34:05.843
{\an1}I don't play (bleep) games.
Like, I am so real.

To me, it doesn't make sense why
you want your ex to be here.

39:45.049 --> 39:49.453
{\an8}She's taking up space,
she's eating my food. I'm sorry,
but she has to go.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.524
Simon, please step up
to your pineapple.

39:53.591 --> 39:56.527
{\an5}There's a few votes
left out there.

39:53.591 --> 39:56.527
{\an1}Yeah.

39:56.594 --> 39:58.896

{\an8}That's five cuts,
Simon.

40:24.288 --> 40:27.625
{\an8}I'm sorry to say,
but your time here
has come to an end.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.693
{\an8}You are no longer
an ex on the beach.

{\an8}Get out of my life. Stay there,
Simon, where you belong. Bye.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.700

Enjoy the night.

Farrah will do anything possible

{\an8}The monster in the house

so watch out, guys.
I'd be careful if I were you.

The only reason I came here was

listen to anything.
It's just her biggest weakness.
