WEBVTT

00:02.961 --> 00:06.716
Nice. And don't
forget bug spray.

00:06.924 --> 00:09.427
It's perfect for spraying
in the face of hitchhikers.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.433
Whoa! An RV, camping gear.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.438
Are you running
from the law again?

00:13.639 --> 00:16.438
Dude, it's the ultimate
Oregon road trip adventure.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.644
More like revenge trip.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.609
Every year, my tourist trap competitors
prank the Mystery Shack.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.821
Last year, those hooligans
duct taped Soos to the ceiling.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.117
That was a fun
78 hours.

00:26.318 --> 00:27.570
Well, no more.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.872
This year, we're visiting
every tourist trap along

00:30.072 --> 00:30.868
the Redwood Highway,

00:31.073 --> 00:33.496
and I'm gonna prank back
every single one.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.126
Bow-wow.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.329
Time to let
the Road Dawgs bark.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.791
That is us.
We are the Road Dawgs.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.966
Thanks for letting me bring
Candy and Grenda along

00:42.167 --> 00:43.840
for our road trip,
Grunkle Stan.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.091
The more, the merrier.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.844
Just sign these
non-disclosure agreements.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.800
None of your parents
are lawyers, right?

00:50.008 --> 00:51.851
What do you say, dude?
You comin'?

00:52.010 --> 00:54.763
I already went to the trouble
of packing all your stuff.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.807
Even the stuff you kept in
that secret box under the bed.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.939
Whoa!
What the...

01:00.143 --> 01:01.690
What's that?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.397
Uh, nothing.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.858
Just Wendy stuff,
from old times.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.283
[frustrated sigh]

01:07.484 --> 01:10.203
Bro, I thought you were
finally past all this.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.701
I know, I know.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.407
I know she's
not interested,

01:13.574 --> 01:14.917
and I know it's over,

01:15.117 --> 01:17.791
but how do you just turn off
the way you feel about someone?

01:17.995 --> 01:20.248
Two words, Dipper.
Move on.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.674
Yeah, dude, and a road trip's
the perfect place

01:22.874 --> 01:24.501
to meet new people.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.563
[panting]

02:18.764 --> 02:20.061
Man, RV's are amazing.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.142
I can't believe
we're sitting at a table

02:22.351 --> 02:23.853
in a moving vehicle.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.735
Ooh! Informational
travel pamphlets.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.737
I want to read them all
and gain their travel knowledge.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.740
Kid, those useless pamphlets
have never helped a single person.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.493
The only wrinkly old
travel guide you'll need is me.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.789
Now look alive.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.788
We're coming up on
an attraction

02:38.992 --> 02:41.586
run by the most black-hearted
proprietor in all of Oregon.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.299
Don't let
the face fool you.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.752
This woman lit
my car on fire

02:47.959 --> 02:49.677
on two non-consecutive
occasions.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.346
<i>RM Whoa!</i>

02:51.546 --> 02:53.264
I'm going in, girls.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.388
Whaaaa!

02:58.929 --> 03:00.602
Okay, like Soos said,

03:00.806 --> 03:02.649
meet new people.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.276
[clears throat]

03:04.476 --> 03:07.150
So, uh, come here often?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.822
No. I'm a tourist.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.774
Ha ha, you're funny...
and cute.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.575
I mean, not cute.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.653
I mean, you're not
not cute.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.408
Whew, let me start over.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.323
My name is Dopper.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.076
[sighs]

03:21.284 --> 03:22.877
[Grunkle Stan]
<i>Dipper,</i> hop <i>to.</i>

03:23.078 --> 03:25.501
<i>This ball of yarn
ain't gonna prank itself.</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:31.886
[sighs]

03:32.087 --> 03:33.805
Something on
your mind, kiddo?

03:34.005 --> 03:36.258
Thinkin' about Miss Cold Shoulder
over there, huh?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.264
Ah, so embarrassed.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.971
Look, earlier this summer,
I ruined my chances with Wendy.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.602
Yeah. Chances.

03:43.807 --> 03:47.152
And I wanna move on,
but I'm terrible at talking to girls.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.945
The moment I open
my mouth around them,

03:49.146 --> 03:50.989
I unravel like...
like...

03:51.189 --> 03:53.988
well, I can't think of a perfect
metaphor, but you get the gist.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.614
At this rate,
I'm gonna grow up

03:55.819 --> 03:58.572
to be a sad loner
like Toby Determined.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.499
Whoa, never say that
about yourself.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.748
Lucky for you,
I'm an expert on women.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.295
Listen to me, kid.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.956
When it comes to girls,
always be confident,

04:07.164 --> 04:08.711
and be funny,
but not too funny.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.543
And be kind of annoying,
but in a loveable way.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.221
I don't know, Grunkle Stan.
This sounds kinda jerky.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.345
Hey, "jerky" is just
a term non-jerks use

04:17.548 --> 04:19.426
to bad-mouth
innocent jerks.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.433
Confidence, comedy, some third
word starting with a "C."

04:22.637 --> 04:25.265
The three C's of the
Stan Pines Dating Technique.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.693
At the next tourist trap,
try out my advice

04:27.851 --> 04:28.898
on the first girl
you see.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.730
Cool.
Grunkle Stan, thanks.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.565
Hey, I'm full of
good ideas.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.949
Speakin' of which,

04:35.150 --> 04:36.868
everyone, now!

04:43.992 --> 04:46.996
Why, you gol-darned
son of a no-good!

04:50.457 --> 04:52.755
I'll get you,
Stan Pines!

04:56.671 --> 04:58.765
Ah, Upside-down Town.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.057
The nausea capital
of the state.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.761
Whatever you do,
don't use the bathrooms.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.976
[all] Road Dawgs!

05:05.180 --> 05:06.648
[barking]

05:11.353 --> 05:13.071
- Whoa!
- So weird.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.699
<i>[Grunkle</i> Stan] <i>All right, kid,
this is it.</i>

05:23.907 --> 05:25.705
<i>Be confident.</i>

05:25.909 --> 05:27.411
[clears throat]
Hi. I'm Dipper.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.041
Crazy place, right?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.214
Oh, hi.
I'm Emma Sue.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.841
If you pretend
we're right-side up,

05:33.041 --> 05:35.135
it looks like everyone's
hair is standing on end.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.837
Huh, yeah.
Weird, right?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.592
Pretend you're screaming.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.765
Okay. You gotta take
a picture of me, though.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.434
[screaming]

05:42.634 --> 05:44.307
Let's see... whoa!

05:44.511 --> 05:45.854
Ho ho, just kidding.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.810
You are the worst.

05:47.973 --> 05:48.940
You bet I am.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.608
I'm bad, Emma.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.768
Kind of a jerk.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.399
Emma, come on.
We have to get to Canada

05:53.603 --> 05:54.729
before your mother
gives birth.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.781
It's a long story.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.734
Maybe you could
tell me sometime.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.444
Here's my email address.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.612
Write me and I'll
tell you all about it.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.787
A girl gave me
her email,

06:05.991 --> 06:07.334
and it wasn't
out of pity.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.494
Ha ha, yes!

06:09.703 --> 06:11.797
Ugh! I'm okay-.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.214
I'm better than okay.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.296
Mabel, hi.
There's my Grenda.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.843
Candy, looking great,
looking great.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.842
Is that a new pair of glasses?
Very shiny.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.889
[laughing]
Whoo!

06:22.048 --> 06:23.891
Maybe it's the blood
pooling in my head,

06:24.050 --> 06:26.018
but Dipper
seems different.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.186
[groans]

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
Yes, good different.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.941
[Grunkle Stan]
Now, Soos.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.026
Not too upside-down now.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.113
What a lovely
normal home.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.415
Stan Pines!

06:48.408 --> 06:49.910
I can't believe
it worked.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.870
What do I do now?
Do I email her?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.796
No, no, you practice.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.999
The more girls you talk to,
the better you get at it.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.835
Grunkle Stan,
these tips are priceless.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.593
And that's just
the tip of the advice-berg.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.492
- Everyone on board?
- Probably.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.539
Guys? Hello?

07:27.739 --> 07:29.366
Anyone?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.284
They'll come back for me.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.167
So then I said
to the bouncer,

07:35.330 --> 07:37.082
"Where's your ID, ugly?"

07:37.248 --> 07:38.875
That's where I got
this scar.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.086
[giggling] Grunkle Stan,
I gotta say,

07:41.252 --> 07:42.754
this was one of
the best days ever.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.307
Look!

07:45.507 --> 07:47.475
That's the Stan Pines
method, kid.

07:47.676 --> 07:48.802
Works every time.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.267
I'm just a little worried,
though.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.350
I mean, is it bad to flirt with
this many girls at once?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.309
I'm just trying
to get over Wendy.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.111
I don't wanna hurt
anyone's feelings.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.608
Please. That's
the best part

07:59.771 --> 08:01.023
of flirting on
a road trip.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.983
You're not gonna see
any of these gals again.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.818
To moving on.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.323
[both laughing]

08:08.405 --> 08:09.873
Okay, it's time for...

08:10.073 --> 08:11.950
[both]
Truth or dare or don't!

08:12.158 --> 08:14.160
I choose don't.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.954
You always choose don't.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.835
Fine. Uh... truth.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.634
Do you like someone?

08:21.835 --> 08:26.011
[Grenda] Uh-oh.
Someone's blushing.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.049
Okay, maybe just a little.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.352
I don't know for sure.
It just started.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.225
Tell us, tell us!

08:32.429 --> 08:34.477
Okay. It begins
with a "D,"

08:34.681 --> 08:36.274
and ends with
an "ipper."

08:36.474 --> 08:38.852
- No.
- Yes.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.437
[shuddering]

08:40.645 --> 08:43.774
Ready, Grenda?
Three, two, one.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.826
[both shrieking loudly]

08:47.027 --> 08:49.325
Man, coyotes sound
a lot worse than I remember.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.834
Candy, Candy, all my life dreams
are coming true right now.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.288
My brother, my best friend.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.671
I can't breathe!

08:58.872 --> 09:01.716
I'm so excited,
I can't breathe!

09:01.916 --> 09:03.509
I never really
noticed him before,

09:03.710 --> 09:05.633
but he seems
deeper lately,

09:05.837 --> 09:07.839
less sweaty
and more charming.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.721
But how do I
approach him?

09:09.924 --> 09:12.643
Don't even worry
about that, Can-Can.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.437
Mabel's got a plan.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.692
[muffled]
Mabel's got a plan.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.441
All right, campers,
we got another day

09:22.645 --> 09:24.022
of breakin' laws
and breakin' hearts.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.232
Everything up until now
has been a walk in the park

09:26.441 --> 09:27.818
compared to our
next attraction.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.324
Is it a walk in
the world's biggest park?

09:30.528 --> 09:32.326
Sort of.
There she is, kids.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.366
Mystery Mountain.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.128
Five times the size
of the Mystery Shack,

09:38.328 --> 09:40.751
and what's worse,
she has real attractions.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.628
Oh, I have read
about this place.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.631
It has sky tram,
and a mummy museum,

09:45.835 --> 09:49.465
and sightings of half-human,
half-spider creatures.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.221
Even their made-up legends
are better than ours.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.928
Today, the mountain falls.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.849
Question: the backseat
makes me carsick.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.559
Can I sit up front today?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.895
Also a question:
I'm the size of two people.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.026
Can I have a whole seat
to myself?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.527
I don't know. Sure.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.781
Ooh, change-up!

10:09.776 --> 10:12.074
[grunts] Wait, that means
it'll be just me and...

10:12.278 --> 10:13.951
Candy Chu.
Sixth grade.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.873
Oh! Hey.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.630
You're sitting close.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.833
[giggling]

10:25.041 --> 10:27.089
So Dipper,
I was wondering,

10:27.252 --> 10:29.050
would you maybe
want to walk around

10:29.212 --> 10:31.214
the Mystery Mountain
with me today?

10:31.422 --> 10:32.765
Sure. I mean...

10:32.966 --> 10:34.309
wasn't that already
the plan?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.432
I mean, just us.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.855
You and me.
Candy and Dipper.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.364
All right, Road Dawgs,
I got five bucks

10:48.565 --> 10:50.818
for whoever can tip
the big blue ox.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.447
GO, go! go-

10:52.610 --> 10:54.328
I will see you
in there.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.955
[nervous giggle]

10:56.156 --> 10:58.158
Hey, what's with
the mopey mug, kid?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.334
Stan, you gotta help me.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.166
Everything you taught me
worked too well.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.046
I think Candy just
asked me out on a date.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.716
Hey, look at
this little champion.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.338
What? No. I mean...

11:08.543 --> 11:10.762
Candy's great, she's sweet,
and she's smart,

11:10.962 --> 11:13.590
but I never thought
of her like that.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.516
This is all moving
way too fast.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.139
[hyperventilating]

11:17.343 --> 11:19.345
Okay, I just need to be
honest with her,

11:19.554 --> 11:21.898
and tell her I'm not
ready for all this.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.817
[laughs] Don't you see
what's happening here?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.736
That's your dumb obsession
with Wendy gettin' in the way

11:26.936 --> 11:29.314
of your future.
If you wanna move on,

11:29.522 --> 11:31.570
you gotta say yes to
whatever comes your way.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.697
Speaking of which...

11:35.904 --> 11:37.531
But I don't wanna
lead her on.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.741
Uh-uh-uh,
watch and learn.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.543
Whoa, I seem to have
lost my number.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.417
Can I borrow yours?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.840
[laughs]
You are a riot.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.758
What brings you here?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.962
We don't normally get men this
handsome round these parts.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.756
Well, Darlene,

11:54.964 --> 11:58.013
between you and me, what I'm
doin' here is a little secret.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.313
Oh, you seem like
a man with secrets.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.729
[both chuckling]

12:02.889 --> 12:04.391
Ugh!

12:04.599 --> 12:06.021
You know, I'm going
on a break.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.196
You wanna take the sky tram
up to widow's Peak?

12:09.395 --> 12:13.775
Take my advice or don't,
but clearly, I know what I'm doing.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.906
Oh, fancy.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.036
Oh, I can't believe
this is happening.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.792
A real date.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.669
I wonder what
they'll name the baby.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.170
If I had a baby,
I would name it

12:30.375 --> 12:33.219
Grenda 2: The Sequel.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.968
You would make
such a good mother.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.597
This place is
so enchanting.

12:39.801 --> 12:40.973
Sort of confused
by the phrase

12:41.177 --> 12:42.804
"new mummies daily"
though.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.188
I mean, how does
that even work?

12:44.389 --> 12:46.483
This mountain's
full of mysteries.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.778
Like why is my head
falling on your shoulder?

12:49.978 --> 12:51.480
Beeoop.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.782
Uh, yep, this is
what I want.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.235
This is all part of the plan
and stuff.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.785
Oh, Dipper, heY-

12:57.986 --> 12:59.704
[gasps]
Corn maze girl.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.872
I was wondering
when you'd call.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.700
Dipper, who is this?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.205
Nobody. I mean, uh...
somebody, but...

13:05.368 --> 13:07.166
Dipper!

13:07.328 --> 13:09.581
I didn't recognize
you right-side up.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
You'll never guess
where my mom gave birth.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.343
Hey, who are
these girls?

13:13.543 --> 13:15.341
Dipper, why haven't
you called?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.764
Did our romantic log ride
mean nothing to you?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.341
I can't believe it.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.176
You agreed to go on
a date with me,

13:21.384 --> 13:23.182
and you are seeing
all these other girls?

13:23.386 --> 13:25.514
Well, answer us.
Which one of us do you like?

13:25.722 --> 13:27.850
I... I like all of you.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.149
I mean, I don't like
any of you.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.727
I mean...

13:30.893 --> 13:32.361
I was trying to learn
how to talk to girls.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.734
[nervous chuckle]

13:33.938 --> 13:35.656
- Unbelievable.
- So gross.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.279
What a jerk.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.862
Dipper Pines, I thought
you were a nice guy,

13:41.070 --> 13:42.868
but I guess you only
care about yourself.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.118
Uh, Candy, wait.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.920
I messed everything up.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.794
I gotta find Stan.
He'll know what to do.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.750
Oh, are you sure
you wanna go

13:53.958 --> 13:56.302
this deep
into the forest?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.594
It's so scary.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.967
Don't worry, toots.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.804
That spider people stuff
is just an urban legend.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.885
I can't believe
people fall for it.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.349
You're so brave.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.555
What can I say?
I'm a real catch.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.266
Yes.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.147
[distorted voice]
The catch of the day.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.820
Uh, I think your contacts
fell out.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.944
[Stan screaming]

14:17.148 --> 14:20.027
[panting] Uh, have you seen
an old guy around here?

14:20.234 --> 14:22.282
Big ears, orange nose,
a real know-it-all.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.411
Uh-uh-uh.
Flame retardant raccoon says,

14:26.616 --> 14:28.789
don't hug forest fires.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.212
[frustrated groan]

14:31.371 --> 14:33.874
Stan, where are you?
I need your advice.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.380
- [static]
- Grunkle Stan?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.336
<i>Hey, buddy boy.</i>

14:38.544 --> 14:40.546
<i>Remember how we were
talkin' about my technique?</i>

14:40.755 --> 14:43.224
<i>Well, sometimes it leads
to unexpected consequences.</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:45.142
Yeah, you can say that again.
Where are you?

14:45.343 --> 14:46.970
<i>The good news is,
I've solved the mystery</i>

14:47.178 --> 14:48.475
<i>of where Oregon's
mummies come from.</i>

14:48.679 --> 14:49.805
<i>The bad news is,</i>

14:49.972 --> 14:51.849
I'm about to become one.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.857
Turns out Darlene is
one of those spider people.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.904
But beyond that,
the date's been okay.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.068
Wait, wait, wait.
Darlene's a spider person?

15:02.276 --> 15:03.744
How is that possible?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.242
I don't know.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.914
One minute, we're having
a perfect date,

15:07.115 --> 15:09.083
and the next minute,
she's growing extra legs

15:09.283 --> 15:11.285
and encasing me in webbing.
Women, right?

15:11.494 --> 15:13.246
You couldn't tell
she was a spider?!

15:13.413 --> 15:15.290
I was blinded by flattery.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.671
Also this acid
she spit in my face.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.297
I'm up the mountain
at widow's Peak.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.800
All right, I'm gonna
find you. Stay put!

15:23.381 --> 15:25.429
You got it.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.603
Uh-uh. Trying to escape?

15:29.887 --> 15:31.560
You tricked me.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.233
I'm 80% certain you don't
really love me at all.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.903
Ha! Men will fall
for anything.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.105
"You're so funny.
Great story.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.032
I love a man
with shoulder hair."

15:42.233 --> 15:45.077
You... you didn't mean it
about my shoulder hair?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.246
Tell me, Stan,
before I transformed,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.666
who'd you think
was in charge?

15:49.866 --> 15:53.712
You, with your cheesy lines
and fake confidence?

15:53.911 --> 15:56.130
I'm the master pick-up
artist here.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.882
Sorry, toots.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.801
This time, you're getting
used for your body,

16:01.002 --> 16:03.551
which, to my weird species,
is food.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.633
Allow me to slip into
something more horrifying.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.313
I wonder what beverage
pairs well

16:12.513 --> 16:14.732
with a vintage
70-something-year-old man.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.734
Be right back.

16:16.934 --> 16:20.359
Come on, Dipper,
where are you?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.531
I feel like
such a fool.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.409
I should have known to guard
my heart in a cage of ice.

16:25.568 --> 16:29.323
[loudly] There, there.
Let my calming voice soothe you.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.832
It is helping.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.500
Girls, there you are.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.544
- Betrayer!
- Oh, you. What do you want?

16:35.745 --> 16:39.045
- I need your help.
- With what, some sick jealousy trip?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.421
- Yes, sing it, Candy!
<i>'</i> Testify!

16:41.626 --> 16:43.594
Look, I'm so sorry
about everything,

16:43.794 --> 16:45.046
but Stan's in trouble.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.635
You can totally
kill me later,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.216
but right now,
he needs us.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.222
I'll explain
on the way.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.149
[humming]

16:57.350 --> 16:59.603
Please. I don't know if
you're really up there or not,

16:59.769 --> 17:02.818
but if you are, please
save me, Paul Bunyan.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.569
[Grenda] Mr. Pines!

17:04.773 --> 17:06.526
Whoa, did that
really work?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.748
Quick, before the rest
of the venom sets in.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.207
No! Where are you?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.790
The sky tram,
everybody on.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.375
I have a plan.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.176
- [Mabel] Ha ha, yeah!
- [Grenda] Perfect.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.597
Ride like the wind,
sky tram.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.805
<i>[man] Welcome to Trambience,</i>

17:31.968 --> 17:33.686
<i>the world's lowest
treetop tram ride.</i>

17:33.886 --> 17:37.311
<i>Enjoy the sights
at 0.1 miles per hour.</i>

17:37.515 --> 17:39.108
[screaming]
Move, move, move!

17:39.308 --> 17:41.436
Can't this thing
go any faster?

17:41.644 --> 17:43.772
<i>No, it can't.
This is Trambience.</i>

17:53.406 --> 17:55.500
<i>Enjoying the view?
Take a picture.</i>

17:55.700 --> 17:57.702
[all screaming]

18:01.330 --> 18:02.547
We're doomed!

18:02.748 --> 18:04.045
We're all gonna die!

18:05.751 --> 18:07.298
Listen carefully.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.972
This sky tram has
an emergency drop switch.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.930
Below us is Oregon's
largest Paul Bunyan statue.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.889
And Old Reliable goes off
in five, four...

18:17.096 --> 18:18.769
- Candy, wait! Don't pull that lever.
- [counting continues]

18:18.931 --> 18:20.103
Kid, are you crazy?

18:20.308 --> 18:21.855
NQVV!

18:42.830 --> 18:46.175
My only weakness,
a giant boot.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.719
A giant newspaper
or a giant cup

18:48.919 --> 18:50.296
would also have been
pretty bad.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.058
<i>Thank you for riding
Trambience sky tram.</i>

18:54.258 --> 18:56.886
<i>Tell your friends
it was a boring, boring ride.</i>

18:57.053 --> 18:58.305
Kid, that was ingenious!

18:58.512 --> 18:59.809
How'd you know
that would work?

18:59.972 --> 19:03.067
Useless travel pamphlets.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.486
[Darlene] Stanley.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.782
I'm sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.859
You'll let me out, right?

19:12.068 --> 19:13.536
What? After all that?

19:13.736 --> 19:15.738
Seriously, do I look like
an amnesiac?

19:15.946 --> 19:19.667
[laughs]
You're so funny.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.040
Have you ever considered
becoming a comedian?

19:22.244 --> 19:24.793
You know, I actually have.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.170
Comedy is too subtle
these days.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.844
My style involves
more over-sized props.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.046
- Let me get you out--
- [all] No!

19:32.254 --> 19:33.756
<i>Oh' Yeah, fight.</i>

19:33.964 --> 19:36.763
You win this round, Stan,
but mark my words.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.061
As long as there's
men like you out there,

19:39.261 --> 19:41.013
with their dumb
one-liners,

19:41.222 --> 19:43.645
and pick-up moves,
I'll never run out of prey.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.937
[screams] Get in
the car, get in the car!

19:57.822 --> 20:00.450
[sighs]

20:02.952 --> 20:05.796
All right, kid,
I gotta admit something.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.669
I'm no expert on women.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.671
Truth is, I've been
divorced once,

20:09.875 --> 20:11.468
and slapped more times
than I can remember.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.262
Confidence can
buy you a lot,

20:13.462 --> 20:14.884
but at the end of the day,

20:15.047 --> 20:16.970
pick-up artists tend
to get our heads bitten off.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.851
When it comes to women,
I'm a failure.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.603
Hey, we're both failures.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.771
You know, even if
your dating tips were bad,

20:25.933 --> 20:28.652
I actually haven't
thought about Wendy all day.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.859
Plus, you did teach me
to be more confident.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.861
I guess I just need
to learn to use

20:33.065 --> 20:34.942
that power for good.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.789
Hey, I found a pamphlet
I don't think you've read yet.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.082
It's okay, Dipper.

20:46.287 --> 20:49.211
The open road makes
people do crazy things.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.126
Plus, after seeing you
flee the spider like a baby,

20:52.334 --> 20:54.086
I kinda lost interest.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.881
YEP, YEP-
I deserve that.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.597
[all cheering]

21:00.801 --> 21:02.303
I still feel
a little bad

21:02.511 --> 21:03.854
about wrecking
those tourist traps.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.772
Ah, come on.
Everyone loves my pranks.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.683
And the best part is,
I never have to face

21:07.850 --> 21:09.818
any consequences...
Sweet lord!

21:11.479 --> 21:13.277
Ah, come on!

21:17.109 --> 21:20.079
That's what you get.
That's what you get!

21:20.279 --> 21:22.953
[laughing]

21:23.157 --> 21:24.659
I don't understand.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.086
I completely
don't deserve this.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.288
Oh, man, are we gonna
have to help clean this up?

21:29.497 --> 21:31.625
Nah, I'm sure
Soos will take care of it.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.755
Where is Soos anyway?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.096
Okay, Soos, remember
what your grandma taught you.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.519
When you get lost,
stay exactly where you are,

21:43.719 --> 21:46.142
and don't move.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.361
Don't move.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.908
[crows cawing]

21:58.108 --> 22:00.657
You know, I would make
a really good scarecrow.
