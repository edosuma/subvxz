00:03.204 --> 00:05.639
(people whooping, cheering;
indistinct shouting and chatter)

00:12.413 --> 00:15.649
(applause and cheering)

00:19.520 --> 00:22.556
Hey! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:22.590 --> 00:24.558
Go!
(engines revving)

00:25.726 --> 00:27.328
(tires squealing)

00:27.361 --> 00:28.796
Go, go, go, go, go!
Yeah!

00:30.531 --> 00:32.466
(shouting, applause
and cheering)

00:34.535 --> 00:38.339
(engines revving)

whooping and cheering)

01:03.431 --> 01:05.499
(engines revving)

01:06.800 --> 01:08.336
Oh, whoa, hey.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.471
(sirens blaring,
overlapping chatter)

01:10.504 --> 01:12.573
Run! Oh, come with me!
Go, go, go, go!

01:12.606 --> 01:14.142
(crowd clamoring)

01:14.175 --> 01:15.443

loud, overlapping chatter)
MAN: Come on! Move!

01:18.512 --> 01:20.581
(clamoring)

01:20.614 --> 01:21.815
MAN:
Run! Come on! With me!
(sirens blaring)

01:21.849 --> 01:24.618
(engines revving)

01:24.652 --> 01:27.188
(sirens blaring)

01:30.524 --> 01:33.194

01:59.787 --> 02:03.391
(sirens approaching)

02:03.424 --> 02:06.460
WOMAN (over radio):
10-41. 10-41.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.496
All available units,
Robert, Tango, Victor,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.564
to North Broad Street.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.833
Tac team en route.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.735
(helicopter hovering,
sirens blaring)

02:14.768 --> 02:17.271
Ah. We need EMTs here.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.639
OFFICER (over radio):
Copy, Adam-214.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.641
Uh, ETA ten minutes.
We'll be right there.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.577
What the hell?!

02:23.611 --> 02:25.579
(sighs)

02:31.319 --> 02:33.321
(indistinct radio communication,
indistinct chatter)

02:33.354 --> 02:35.789
(siren whoops)

02:35.823 --> 02:38.259
OFFICER: Behind the tape.
Sorry.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.427
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

02:39.460 --> 02:43.464
LAPD confirmed the driver of
the other car was Brad Harper.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.733
Died on impact.
Damn.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.635
Officer said he just
celebrated his 21st birthday.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.570
MUNDO:
No skid marks.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.772
This car didn't
even try to stop.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.941
The report says
that our driverless vehicle

02:53.974 --> 02:56.444
was involved
in an illegal street race.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.246
Owner reported it stolen...

02:58.279 --> 03:00.414
(engine revving)

03:03.684 --> 03:05.486
(tires squealing)

03:07.421 --> 03:09.523
...and driven straight through
his closed garage door.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.626
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

03:12.660 --> 03:14.362
Drag racing a
remote-controlled car

03:14.395 --> 03:16.497
just took car-hacking
to a whole new level.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.700
Someone out there
is playing Grand Theft Auto,

03:19.733 --> 03:22.570
only this is no video game.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.572
The victims are real.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.374
(indistinct radio communication)
MAN: Come with me.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.548
Okay, so, this is the
same make and model

03:34.582 --> 03:37.017
of the car that was
stolen and crashed.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.887
I generated a 3-D model
based on factory blueprints,

03:39.920 --> 03:41.655
and then highlighted
the mechanical systems

03:41.689 --> 03:43.557
that connected to the
car's onboard computer.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.726
Which, thanks to super cool,

03:45.759 --> 03:48.262
yet totally unnecessary
new features,

03:48.296 --> 03:50.564
is pretty much everything.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.734
Headlights, turn signals,
steering, brakes--

03:53.767 --> 03:54.835
all vulnerable.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.004
Cars are pretty much
computers on wheels these days.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.308
Yet another reason
to love my '68 Mustang.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.842
(laughs)
Do me a favor.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.677
Pull up the crime scene photos,
will you?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.313
Yeah.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.353
Yeah, how do...
how do we know that the...

04:12.386 --> 04:15.523
the driver didn't jump
from the car before the crash?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.758
I think
this was the ultimate car hack.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.959
Someone was

04:18.992 --> 04:20.394
remotely driving this car.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.662
And how do we know that
for certain?

04:21.695 --> 04:23.664
The Event Data Recorder
will tell us.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.467
90% of new
cars have one.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.635
Records everything
in the moments

04:27.668 --> 04:29.002
leading up to
a collision.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.804
And there are sensors
underneath the seats,

04:30.838 --> 04:33.407
so it'll tell us if
anybody was inside.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.345
Like a little black box
in an airplane crash,

04:37.378 --> 04:39.580
this device will tell us
everything that happened.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.549
Okay, I buy that.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.784
(grunting with effort)

04:45.986 --> 04:47.755
It's kind of a mess in here.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.089
KRUMITZ:
It should be jammed up against

04:49.122 --> 04:50.324
the wheel well.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.328
All right, I'm plugging
to the car's CAN-Bus,

04:54.362 --> 04:55.696
downloading data.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.365
KRUMITZ:
Great. Okay, now,

04:57.398 --> 04:59.032
the black box will tell us
everything that happened

04:59.066 --> 05:00.401
leading up to the collision,

05:00.434 --> 05:01.702
and the CAN-Bus

05:01.735 --> 05:04.472
should tell us how
the target hacked in.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.508
Now, if it were me, I'd
go one of three ways--

05:07.541 --> 05:08.742
the navigation system,

05:08.776 --> 05:10.778
the emergency
response system, or

05:10.811 --> 05:12.613
the onboard diagnostic dongle.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.748
(laughing):
The what?

05:14.782 --> 05:15.949
Dongle.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.651
The insurance company's device

05:17.685 --> 05:19.086
you self-install

05:19.119 --> 05:21.054
to get your money back
for safe driving?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.123
Yeah, dongle.
(laughing): That's what I said!

05:23.156 --> 05:26.627
Well, you use that word one more
time, I'm gonna call HR.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.129
Dongle.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.698
Oh, I-I...
Dongle!

05:30.731 --> 05:31.499
Okay, there you go, buddy.
What? It's a computer thing!

05:31.532 --> 05:33.801
RUSSELL:
No, I'm calling right now.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.068
You wouldn't say that
around Avery, would you?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.704
NELSON:
What are you guys talking about?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.472
I'm sorry.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.441
Okay.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.075
Oh, my.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.677
All right.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.646
Got it.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.616
Doesn't look too damaged.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.850
All right.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.685
NELSON:
All right.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.986
We'll send the data
from the black box,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.988
along with everything
from the car's computer.
KRUMITZ: Wait.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.857
If I'm analyzing the black box
and the CAN-Bus,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.158
what are you guys gonna do?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.827
We're going to Disneyland.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.529
(laughs)

06:02.830 --> 06:04.465
You don't think they're really
gonna go, do you?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.466
I would.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.868
WOMAN (on TV):
I'm here in downtown Los Angeles

06:07.901 --> 06:11.171
where late last night,
an illegal street race resulted

06:11.204 --> 06:14.542
in the tragic death
of a young man

06:14.575 --> 06:16.444
on his way home from work.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.813
Witnesses claim the street race
was broken up by police

06:19.847 --> 06:21.815
and one of the cars
fled the scene.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.652
But in a shocking turn of
events, witnesses also claim

06:24.685 --> 06:26.754
that no one was
behind the wheel.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.722
We're waiting for police...

06:28.756 --> 06:30.458
RAMIREZ:
What's Director Silver
doing in Cyber?

06:30.491 --> 06:32.092
Ah, he's giving tours.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.994
Got to hire a new
deputy director

06:34.027 --> 06:35.863
since Avery
turned down the position.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.699
But more importantly,
why are all the darn pens

06:38.732 --> 06:40.468
in this place
missing springs?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.202
Nobody uses
pens anymore.
Well...

06:42.235 --> 06:45.773
There is so much press on this
accident and the driverless car.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.775
Did you see this?

06:47.808 --> 06:50.744
I saw it on the news five times

06:50.778 --> 06:54.114
before realizing it was
my son's car that was hit.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.084
I came here to ask every network

06:57.117 --> 06:58.886
to stop replaying the footage.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.521
Please!

07:00.554 --> 07:02.790
Just stop playing it.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.958
Let us grieve in peace.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.227
RUSSELL:
Losing a child...

07:07.260 --> 07:08.361
unthinkable.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.832
But having to watch all of this
over and over again--

07:11.865 --> 07:13.066
can't even imagine.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.168
Footage of the crash
is on every network,

07:15.202 --> 07:17.170
blog, social media site.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.507
A remote-controlled
car on the loose?

07:19.540 --> 07:22.510
It's a huge story.
Well, let's find
and arrest

07:22.543 --> 07:24.745
the hacker responsible,
make that the story.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.947
All right, where are we?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.882
Krumitz asked me to
analyze the black box,

07:28.916 --> 07:31.852
and I don't think this
accident was an accident.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.821
The target's car
was picking up speed

07:33.854 --> 07:35.088
when it slammed
into Brad Harper.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.790
Wait a minute.
The car is accelerating?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.926
RAMIREZ:
And steered into the collision.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.027
(engine revving)

07:40.060 --> 07:42.029
The target crashed his car
on purpose.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.832
Why? Was he trying
to get rid of the digital dust

07:44.865 --> 07:45.999
so we couldn't track him?

07:46.033 --> 07:48.969
Yeah, he didn't.
His car's computer is

07:49.002 --> 07:50.838
telling us that his
commands were not

07:50.871 --> 07:53.807
from the navigation system,
emergency response system,

07:53.841 --> 07:55.809
or the insurance dongle.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.545
He didn't hack in remotely.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.213
So our target installed
a foreign device

08:00.247 --> 08:02.916
to control the car,
and we need to find it.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.188
*

08:22.202 --> 08:23.871
*

08:26.173 --> 08:29.810
Guys! Guys! Check it out.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.013
An open source microcontroller
connected to the car's OBDtwo.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.548
It's got to be
our hacking tool.
RYAN: This is how

08:34.582 --> 08:35.983
the target took
control of the car.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.117
Got a SIM card,

08:37.150 --> 08:39.019
which means it has
a cellular connection.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.122
Target could've been controlling
this vehicle from anywhere.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.857
NELSON:
We can pull records

08:43.891 --> 08:45.859
to find the cell number the
SIM card was connecting with.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.895
And get the target's
current location.
Mm-hmm.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.863
All right, it's race time, baby!

08:49.897 --> 08:51.999
Now, where is he?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.834
MUNDO:
Target's cell was a burner.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.003
Dropped off the network
the moment the race ended.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.039
We can't track him.
But we can track the cell
towers the phone connected with.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.144
MUNDO:
Only pinged one tower, so he
was relatively stationary.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.846
However,

09:05.879 --> 09:07.147
target was controlling

09:07.180 --> 09:09.650
the vehicle from somewhere
within this circle.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.751
NELSON:
That's all of downtown

09:10.784 --> 09:12.686
Los Angeles.
No way we'll find him.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.854
RYAN:
Then we'll find the other

09:13.887 --> 09:15.789
driver from last night's race.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.257
Look, street racing
is dangerous enough.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.926
This black hat has

09:18.959 --> 09:20.694
no regard
for anyone else's safety.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.096
We have to find him
before he races again,

09:23.130 --> 09:25.165
or more people will die.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.767
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

09:31.972 --> 09:38.111
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

09:40.013 --> 09:46.186
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

09:46.219 --> 09:49.690
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:49.723 --> 09:53.727
* I can see for miles
and miles *

09:53.761 --> 09:57.831
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:57.865 --> 10:01.401
* And miles...

10:01.434 --> 10:02.636
* Oh, yeah.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.952
(hip-hop intro plays)

10:18.986 --> 10:20.087
* West up

10:20.120 --> 10:22.289
* Turn the volume up and
bang it out the trunk now *

10:22.322 --> 10:24.858
* Turn the volume up and bang
it out the trunk, yeah *

10:24.892 --> 10:26.126
* Turn the volume up and bang it
out the trunk... *

10:26.159 --> 10:29.129
MAN: Putting a blower on that
one so we'll need a new intake.

10:29.162 --> 10:33.300
MAN 2: Hey, Tuko, let me know,
I'm about to get under it.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.368
MAN 3:
Did you grind it, man?

10:35.402 --> 10:36.737
*

10:36.770 --> 10:39.907
(man speaking Spanish)
...the pressure.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.376
(indistinct chatter)

10:43.410 --> 10:47.014
MUNDO: FBI. We're looking
for the owner of that car.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.817
They go by the name
Blaze, AKA

10:49.850 --> 10:51.985
Carmen Lopez.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.726
This is about the race
the other night?

10:58.759 --> 11:01.061
I already spoke to the cops,
and they let me go.

11:01.094 --> 11:05.132
Yes, but we're FBI--
we have questions of our own.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.302
Someone died
during that race.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.404
You could be charged with
involuntary manslaughter.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.406
I was yanked from my car
and handcuffed five miles away

11:13.440 --> 11:14.541
from that crash.

11:14.574 --> 11:17.144
Carmen, who was controlling
the other car in that race?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.178
I don't know.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.446
RYAN: You're new to this crew.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.948
No neck tattoo.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.450
You're not a full-
fledged member yet.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.853
That race was your initiation.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.788
L.A. Street Kings
looking for new drivers

11:27.821 --> 11:29.456
to transport drugs
across the border?

11:29.489 --> 11:32.159
As I'm sure you already
know, in addition

11:32.192 --> 11:34.027
to illegal street racing,
word is your friends

11:34.061 --> 11:35.763
are also running
a massive drug ring.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.966
You have two prior arrests
for drug possession.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.701
You talk, or you're
looking at time.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.472
The other driver goes
by the name Smokescreen.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.207
No one knows his real name.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.977
He contacts who he wants to race
from an unknown number,

11:50.010 --> 11:53.013
picks a location, and shows up
in a different car each time.

11:53.046 --> 11:53.981
When's the next race?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.750
Don't know.
He races when he feels like it.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.752
Doesn't give much notice.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.420
So unless you're gonna book me

12:00.453 --> 12:02.489
on some trumped-up charge
we all know won't stick...

12:02.522 --> 12:04.758
we're done here.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.429
(wry laugh)

12:30.951 --> 12:32.820
(beeps twice)

12:33.954 --> 12:38.325
* Dancing, let's go dancing

12:38.358 --> 12:43.496
* Let's go dancing...

12:43.530 --> 12:46.566
(song continues, quietly)

12:46.599 --> 12:50.270
(music changes
abruptly to driving rock)

12:50.303 --> 12:52.472
(rock music continues)

12:52.505 --> 12:54.307
*

12:54.341 --> 12:56.343
(rock song continues playing)

12:57.544 --> 13:00.113
(engine roaring)
(gasps): Oh! Oh, my God!

13:01.381 --> 13:02.883
(gasping loudly)

13:02.916 --> 13:05.552
(tires screech, horns honk)
MAN: Dude! What's up?!

13:05.585 --> 13:08.555
(gasping): Oh, my God!
Oh, my God... oh, God...

13:08.588 --> 13:10.190
(rock music continues)

13:12.893 --> 13:15.362
OPERATOR (over speaker):
911. What is your emergency?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.397
DRIVER:
Yeah-yeah, you got to help me!

13:17.430 --> 13:19.466
My car's out of control
and it's driving itself!

13:19.499 --> 13:20.267
What do you got?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.369
I've been searching
for any posts

13:22.402 --> 13:25.072
about Smokescreen,
and a ton of them
just popped up.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.175
Everyone's talking
about this car chase
in Los Angeles right now,

13:28.208 --> 13:30.010
claiming it's Smokescreen.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.344
Pull it up.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.446
TV NEWSWOMAN: We're live
right now, with reports

13:33.480 --> 13:34.281
that a car is allegedly being...

13:34.314 --> 13:36.249
RAMIREZ:
Okay, the driver called 911

13:36.283 --> 13:38.018
in a panic, saying
he lost control of the car

13:38.051 --> 13:39.586
and that it was driving
on its own.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.521
Wait a minute,
it was somebody inside the car

13:41.554 --> 13:42.455
this time?

13:42.489 --> 13:45.225
Looks like he found himself
a new challenge.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.227
LAPD.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.597
(sirens wailing)
(gasping, grunting)

13:50.630 --> 13:52.232
Come on!

13:52.265 --> 13:55.202
OFFICER:
Pulled the driver from the car.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.038
Kept saying he wasn't driving,
but he was buckled in,

13:58.071 --> 13:59.306
behind the wheel.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.507
He wasn't driving.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.009
DRIVER:
It just took over.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.511
I-I... I sideswiped
a few other cars.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.512
It was out of control.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.647
But the car slowed down
when the cops showed up,

14:07.680 --> 14:10.617
so I tried to jump out,
but the doors wouldn't unlock.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.452
I was trapped.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.488
I-I know it sounds crazy, but
it's like the car was possessed.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.991
You said that when
the police showed up

14:18.025 --> 14:20.027
the car slowed down.
Yeah.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.395
Then sped up again,
right before the crash.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.198
I-I'm just glad my son
wasn't in the car with me.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.201
I was on my way to pick him up
from soccer practice.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.003
Steven,
once we know you're okay,

14:30.037 --> 14:32.172
we're gonna have more
questions for you.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.178
Got it.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.615
(grunts)

14:42.649 --> 14:44.051
(sighs)

14:44.084 --> 14:46.319
Configured exactly like
the first one we found.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.189
No two hackers build
a board the same way.
Uh-huh.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.525
Let's see what cell phone this
SIM card was communicating with.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.694
All right.
Our target's
escalating.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.529
Drag racing
remote-control cars

14:56.563 --> 14:59.032
is no longer a big
enough thrill for him.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.633
If somebody
is in the car,

15:00.667 --> 15:02.169
his stakes are higher.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.637
He wanted the police to
be there when he crashed,

15:04.671 --> 15:06.639
to prove that he was driving.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.109
It may be remote, but
it gives our target

15:09.142 --> 15:10.577
a sense of power and control,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.980
something that he lacks
in his real life.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.347
I think I got him.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.251
MUNDO:
Cell phone's still on.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.456
(siren blaring)
(indistinct chatter)

15:25.625 --> 15:26.726
FBI! Hands in the air!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.962
Get your hands in the air!
Stay right where you are!

15:28.996 --> 15:29.629
Nobody move!

15:29.662 --> 15:30.697
The signal's getting stronger.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.466
The device Smokescreen used
must be here somewhere.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.637
Oh, come on,
this is harassment.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.439
(rapid beeping)

15:44.544 --> 15:46.379
Bingo!

15:46.413 --> 15:48.648
The cell phone used
to communicate

15:48.681 --> 15:51.284
with the car-hacking tool
in Steven Fuller's vehicle.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.720
All right,
whose car is this?
You plant that in my ride?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.588
It's your car.
Turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.091
Yo, this is a joke. I've never
seen that phone before.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.328
CARMEN:
Hey, Martinez, say nothing.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.030
Stay out of it.
You cannot do this.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.732
Obstruction of justice is
a felony under federal law.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.634
Cuff her.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.069
Seriously?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.743
*

16:18.645 --> 16:22.149
You're very protective
of Paul Martinez.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.251
You two must be
very close.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.619
Or is that a part of your cover?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.755
Carmen Lopez,

16:28.788 --> 16:30.223
AKA Blaze,

16:30.257 --> 16:32.425
AKA April Castilla.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.693
Detective Castilla.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.728
LAPD Gang Unit.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.215
How did you make me?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.517
LAPD's cracking down
on street racing;

16:57.550 --> 17:00.287
they let you go without
even charging you;
and you're wearing

17:00.320 --> 17:01.754
the color of the day

17:01.788 --> 17:04.357
so that other officers know
that you're undercover.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.159
You've been playing
with your bracelet.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.661
Today's color is green.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.663
Agent Ryan,
you're about to ruin

17:10.697 --> 17:11.898
a six-month undercover sting.

17:11.931 --> 17:15.468
Do you know how hard it was
to get in with these dealers?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.404
Gain their trust?

17:17.437 --> 17:19.372
We'll do our best
to keep your cover intact.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.508
Detective Castilla,

17:21.541 --> 17:24.244
what can you tell me
about Paul Martinez?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.778
He's the alpha.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.348
The brains behind
a drug-smuggling operation

17:28.381 --> 17:31.518
coming in from Mexico--
but can't prove it yet.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.353
Is he Smokescreen?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.488
I don't know.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.558
But... a lot of those guys
are tech-savvy.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.493
Paul taught me how
to boost horsepower

17:40.527 --> 17:43.196
by tuning my car's ECU
and removing emission controls.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.532
So maybe that is
the guy you're looking for.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.268
But one thing
I do know--

17:48.301 --> 17:50.270
if Paul Martinez finds out
I'm a narc,

17:50.303 --> 17:52.439
it's not my cover
that's at risk...

17:52.472 --> 17:53.740
it's my life.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.245
*

17:58.278 --> 17:59.646
NELSON:
Hey, Raven, still no clue

17:59.679 --> 18:01.481
how our target saw the road.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.682
Some newer cars have
front-facing cameras

18:02.715 --> 18:06.186
in the grill to help them park,
but this car has a camera

18:06.219 --> 18:09.156
on the trunk
for going in reverse.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.590
RAMIREZ: Well, the target

18:10.623 --> 18:11.791
had to see somehow.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.092
You know, I love when you do

18:13.126 --> 18:16.796
your thinking face--
you look so... mm! So serious.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.265
Stop it.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.899
Stop. This is serious.

18:19.932 --> 18:20.900
NELSON (laughs): What?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.402
I'm just sayin'.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.903
I mean, you look nice today.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.539
As pretty on screen
as in person.

18:26.573 --> 18:29.309
Uh-huh. And I'm sure
you haven't noticed

18:29.342 --> 18:31.578
any of the beautiful women
in L.A.?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.180
What do you mea... I...

18:33.213 --> 18:34.747
Did Krummy say something?

18:34.781 --> 18:38.485
No. But you just did.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.453
(laughs):
Busted.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.321
Hey, what about this?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.756
A lane-assisting feature
some cars have.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.393
A camera mounted behind
the rearview mirror that enables

18:46.426 --> 18:48.461
the car to steer itself
back into its lane

18:48.495 --> 18:50.530
if the driver falls asleep.
All right, well, let's see

18:50.563 --> 18:52.499
if this car has one.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.434
Looks like it does.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.469
Good call, Raven.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.871
Now, let's see
how this thing works.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.341
Uh...

19:01.374 --> 19:02.542
Okay, we're in.

19:02.575 --> 19:06.279
Our hacker was using that image
to navigate?

19:06.313 --> 19:09.216
(scoffs) Pretty hard to see
what's ahead of you on the road.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.483
NELSON: Hold on.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.386
It was in night-mode,
which is infrared.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.587
Mm...

19:14.621 --> 19:16.223
All right, here we go.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.425
RAMIREZ: All right, this was
Smokescreen's point of view.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.760
He could see forward
and he could see behind him.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.495
Yeah, but no side view.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.564
Talk about a blind spot.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.503
Hey. What do you got?

19:30.537 --> 19:31.938
Okay, I analyzed data

19:31.971 --> 19:33.573
from both cars'
internal computers.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.308
RUSSELL: Uh-huh.
Now, once the car-hacking tool

19:35.342 --> 19:37.710
was installed, it logged
an error message,

19:37.744 --> 19:39.912
but never appeared
on the dash.

19:39.946 --> 19:40.813
There were no...

19:40.847 --> 19:43.316
no warning lights or
anything, so the...

19:43.350 --> 19:45.752
the driver never knew.
Am I boring you?

19:45.785 --> 19:48.521
Uh, tell me what's happening
to the pens around here,

19:48.555 --> 19:50.390
will you, please?
All the springs are missing.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.460
KRUMITZ: I don't know.
Who uses pens anymore?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.495
Well, apparently only me.
Okay, okay.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.329
Like I was saying,

19:56.363 --> 19:58.265
I've got a recorded
error message

19:58.298 --> 19:59.766
on each car's computer,

19:59.799 --> 20:01.868
and the time stamp
of when it occurred.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.637
So if we just check
the navigation system history...

20:04.671 --> 20:06.906
It will give us the location
where our target

20:06.939 --> 20:09.642
physically installed the device.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.710
Exactly.
Great.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.445
Do it. Can I have my pen back?

20:12.479 --> 20:13.813
No.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.421
We got a hit.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.590
Looks like the CAN-bus signal
was disrupted

20:23.623 --> 20:26.393
at the Studio City
Hand Car Wash.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.861
Based on that location, I'm
not so sure that Paul Martinez

20:28.895 --> 20:31.364
is our guy.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.833
*

20:36.836 --> 20:39.739
(vacuum whirring)
MAN:
All right, we're ready here!

20:42.942 --> 20:44.977
Pretty sick ride, huh?

20:45.011 --> 20:46.679
Owner did some serious mods.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.881
Must be, like, 500 horsepower
under the hood.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.352
Damn.
I'd kill for a ride like this.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.286
Me, too.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.724
Ah...

21:08.568 --> 21:10.570
(indistinct chatter)

21:11.838 --> 21:13.806
MAN: This one here gets
the hand polish!

21:13.840 --> 21:16.976
MUNDO:
Looking for the owner.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.578
(workers and customers
chatting back and forth)

21:21.881 --> 21:23.983
Special Agent
Avery Ryan.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.018
We're looking for someone
who may work here.
Sure.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.587
What's his name?

21:27.620 --> 21:29.356
We're looking for Smokescreen.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.023
You got a first name?

21:31.057 --> 21:33.760
Or is that his first name?
It's hard to tell these days.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.895
(chuckles) Well, we'll need
to speak with your staff.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.865
We'll need information
on all your employees.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.633
Hey!
(whistles)

21:40.667 --> 21:42.969
Bring it in!

21:43.002 --> 21:45.572
Uh, you can talk to who's here.

21:45.605 --> 21:49.041
I don't really keep... official
records on my employees.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.677
(chuckles)

21:50.710 --> 21:52.379
Hey, Diego.
Yo.

21:52.412 --> 21:52.812
Where's Kevin?

21:52.845 --> 21:53.780
Who's Kevin?

21:53.813 --> 21:54.781
He's one of my vacuum guys.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.483
He was here just a second ago.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.928
He's kind of hard to miss.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.676
(starts engine)

22:23.710 --> 22:24.711
(engine revs)

22:32.685 --> 22:33.620
MUNDO:
All right, so all we know

22:33.653 --> 22:34.987
about our target so far
is his name is Kevin

22:35.021 --> 22:36.456
and he's in a
wheelchair.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.157
Well, it makes perfect sense.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.427
Without the ability to use
his legs, he can't compete

22:40.460 --> 22:42.161
with real world racers.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.830
He's got to beat 'em
in cyberspace.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.699
You know, I bet it's racing
that put him in that wheelchair.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.701
But he became addicted
to the excitement,

22:48.735 --> 22:51.638
to the adrenaline rush.
That's why he can't give it up.

22:51.671 --> 22:55.174
Well, why set up Paul Martinez
to take the fall?
There must be

22:55.207 --> 22:56.543
a connection, a history.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.777
So what now?

22:57.810 --> 23:00.413
We challenge Smokescreen
to a race.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.415
He'll connect
to his car hacking tool.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.551
He stays online long enough,
we can track him down.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.818
With all
the media coverage

23:05.852 --> 23:07.554
on his remotely driven vehicles,

23:07.587 --> 23:09.489
he'll be eager
to show his skills.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.857
But he'll be suspicious

23:10.890 --> 23:12.459
of a new challenger.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.794
So we get somebody
he's raced before.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.829
A race he never got to finish.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.036
(vehicle approaching)

23:28.775 --> 23:30.142
I got a message
to meet my handler here.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.644
I should have been suspicious.

23:31.678 --> 23:32.679
Called in a favor.

23:32.712 --> 23:33.946
I knew you wouldn't show
otherwise.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.181
You're compromising my cover.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.583
Carmen, we need your help.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.817
I have enough problems.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.986
The Street Kings are looking
for a snitch in their crew now.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.655
Paul knows someone planted
that phone in his car.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.591
Someone did. Smokescreen.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.827
Do you realize how bad
you're making this for me?

23:47.860 --> 23:49.729
I thought this meeting was
to pull me off the case

23:49.762 --> 23:51.163
before I get killed.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.599
A man lost his life.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.534
If Smokescreen keeps
racing, who knows

23:54.567 --> 23:56.135
how many more lives
are gonna be lost?

23:56.168 --> 23:57.804
We need to find out
his real identity.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.672
We need you
to race Smokescreen again.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.741
And what makes you think
he's gonna want to race me?

24:01.774 --> 24:02.909
He's competitive.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.778
You post a public challenge
to a rematch on ToggleFly,

24:05.812 --> 24:08.247
his ego will
force him to comply.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.217
I believe you were in the lead
when the cops showed up.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.754
I help you, you help me.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.255
When you brought Paul in
for questioning,

24:16.288 --> 24:17.924
you didn't get all
of his devices.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.792
I copied the hard drive
of Paul's laptop.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.795
But it's been encrypted.
My team can't crack it.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.764
You can.
You decrypt this for me,

24:24.797 --> 24:27.466
and I'll challenge Smokescreen
to a rematch.

24:33.005 --> 24:36.142
RAMIREZ: Automatic License Plate
Reader Database?
RUSSELL: Yep.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.811
It's pretty amazing, actually.
Cameras mounted on squad cars

24:38.845 --> 24:41.848
and street poles,
they're constantly

24:41.881 --> 24:45.518
scanning license plates to check
against a list of citations

24:45.552 --> 24:46.853
and warrant records.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.922
And then the camera captures
time, date,

24:49.956 --> 24:53.826
and location of the vehicle, and
all that information is saved.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.028
So, basically, anyone's
pattern of life--

24:56.062 --> 24:59.298
going to work, where you
live, going to the movies--

24:59.331 --> 25:01.300
can be determined
through this database.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.636
RUSSELL:
Pretty cool, huh? Okay,

25:03.670 --> 25:05.171
so what do we know
about our target?

25:05.204 --> 25:07.774
He drove to the car wash,
but he parked far enough away

25:07.807 --> 25:10.943
that his coworkers
could not I.D. his car.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.680
And-and he worked
on the weekends. We know that.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.848
So we need to find
the common license plates

25:15.882 --> 25:18.050
parked near the car wash
Saturday and Sunday.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.852
Right. And narrow it down
from there.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.788
How many license plates
are in the database?

25:21.821 --> 25:24.657
Uh, in L.A....?

25:24.691 --> 25:27.660
(exhales)
Three million per week.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.196
It would take
a couple hundred thousand.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.330
(sighs)

25:31.363 --> 25:32.865
Well, we better
get started then.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.233
Yes, please.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.268
*

26:04.030 --> 26:05.197
RYAN: Nelson, what's your ETA?

26:05.231 --> 26:08.367
Just pulled up.
It's pretty crowded already.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.369
Don't think Blaze or Smokescreen
are here yet.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.604
It's hard to tell, though.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.607
I mean, Smokescreen could be
controlling any car out here.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.842
Elijah, are those
cell numbers coming in?

26:15.875 --> 26:18.010
Flooding in is
more like it.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.614
AVERY: We're looking
for the cell number

26:21.648 --> 26:23.850
being used
by the car hacking tool.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.818
Nelson, your cell catcher
still hasn't found

26:25.852 --> 26:26.853
Smokescreen's burner phone.

26:29.288 --> 26:33.726
MUNDO:
Should be the only prepaid SIM
card not linked to a subscriber.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.727
It could take time.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.862
NELSON:
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

26:35.895 --> 26:36.896
(crowd cheering)
You got to hurry.

26:36.929 --> 26:37.897
Smokescreen just got here.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.899
MAN:
Ha-ha! All right!

26:39.932 --> 26:41.668
This is gonna be awesome!

26:41.701 --> 26:43.269
WOMAN:
Yeah, Smokescreen!

26:43.302 --> 26:46.005
(cheering)

26:48.875 --> 26:52.044
(music throbbing)

26:55.915 --> 26:57.049
Is Blaze there yet?

26:57.083 --> 26:59.886
Uh, I don't see her car
anywhere.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.087
Think she bailed on us?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.089
No. She promised she would help.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.091
There must be something wrong.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.793
What if we race Smokescreen
with my car?

27:06.826 --> 27:08.127
No, Nelson, stick to the plan.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.229
No, look, not me, my car.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.898
I have one of Smokescreen's
hacking tools in my bag.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.432
You know what,
that could work.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.368
If Blaze is a no-show,
our target

27:16.402 --> 27:19.205
won't be able to resist racing
someone trying to beat him

27:19.238 --> 27:20.072
at his own game.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.875
Driverless car
versus driverless car.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.944
He'll want
to protect his reputation.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.046
Nelson, start getting
your car ready.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.081
(spectator whooping)

27:30.082 --> 27:31.984
You really think
this is possible?

27:32.018 --> 27:34.854
Remotely driving a car
from across the country

27:34.887 --> 27:36.055
without crashing it?

27:36.088 --> 27:38.457
It's safer than someone else
racing against Smokescreen.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.292
Look, I didn't have
a lot of time,

27:40.326 --> 27:42.161
but I wrote a script
to make hotkeys.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.131
Up arrow, gas.
Down arrow, reverse.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.766
Pretty basic commands
but it should work.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.000
Should?

27:48.034 --> 27:50.369
No time to field test it.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.706
KRUMITZ: Nelson,
you almost ready?
Yeah,

27:53.740 --> 27:56.475
just about. Putting the SIM card
into the car hacking tool.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.977
Should be able to connect to it.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.312
(grunts)

28:00.346 --> 28:03.716
And we are connected.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.719
I have full control
over your rental car.

28:06.753 --> 28:09.188
Well, just remember,
I sprung for the premium package

28:09.221 --> 28:10.923
to fit in around here,

28:10.957 --> 28:12.859
and it's on
my credit card, so...

28:12.892 --> 28:15.027
Price for riding in style, bud.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.495
You're installing a camera
in there for me, right?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.264
Yep.

28:18.297 --> 28:22.268
I'm rigging something up
right... now.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.403
All right.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.906
WOMAN:
What?! Oh!

28:26.939 --> 28:28.908
(phone line ringing)

28:28.941 --> 28:30.977
CARMEN (recorded):
You've reached Carmen.
Leave a message.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.912
(sighs)
Carmen's still not answering.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.347
Yeah, she hasn't checked in
with her handler yet either.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.783
She was supposed to
before the race.

28:36.816 --> 28:37.917
So what do we do?
First, we find

28:37.950 --> 28:39.285
Smokescreen, then Carmen.

28:41.954 --> 28:45.057
(indistinct chatter,
phones ringing)

28:45.091 --> 28:45.958
Whoa, whoa.
Sir... oh...

28:45.992 --> 28:47.794
Director Silver.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.528
I'm so sorry.
D.B. Russell.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.130
Forgive me.
Of course. Good to see you.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.199
How are things going
in Cyber Division?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.934
A little chaotic
at the moment, sir.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.937
We're getting ready to drive
a car in Los Angeles

28:57.970 --> 29:00.272
from a computer here in this
room, believe it or not.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.941
That's possible?
Uh,

29:01.974 --> 29:03.309
yeah. Terrifying, right?

29:03.342 --> 29:05.311
A lot about car hacking
in the news lately.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.113
Seems like every day
there's a new headline.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.447
Well, we're-we're, uh...

29:08.480 --> 29:10.282
we're working
on making it less newsworthy.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.952
Just got to beat the bad guy
to the, uh, finish line.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.987
Sorry about that.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.823
I'm not finding any
prepaid SIM cards.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.826
Nelson, are you close enough
to Smokescreen's car to grab

29:19.859 --> 29:21.894
his signal?
Uh-huh. So close I can touch it.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.963
Are you sure
you're not getting anything?

29:23.996 --> 29:26.765
(cheering)

29:29.535 --> 29:31.537
(music throbbing)
(cheering)

29:39.045 --> 29:41.080
KRUMITZ:
I know I'm supposed
to keep Smokescreen racing

29:41.113 --> 29:44.083
so we can track him, but
does it matter if I win or lose?

29:44.116 --> 29:46.018
Because I kick ass
at Gran Turismo,

29:46.052 --> 29:47.419
so I'm planning on winning.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.221
Okay, you guys, listen up.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.924
I just sent you the top 100 hits
that we got

29:51.958 --> 29:54.861
from the license plate database:

29:54.894 --> 29:57.596
Vehicles most frequently spotted
close to the car wash.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.333
We're searching for any
with a disability plate

30:01.367 --> 30:04.170
or a registered handicapped
parking permit.

30:04.203 --> 30:07.006
So, let's go-- any one
of those vehicles could belong

30:07.039 --> 30:08.274
to our target.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.309
Okay, I created
a ToggleFly account

30:10.342 --> 30:12.244
under the name Ghost
and challenged Smokescreen

30:12.278 --> 30:14.981
because Blaze is a no-show.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.016
Any response?
Not yet.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.284
Guess we're gonna
have to find out

30:18.317 --> 30:19.618
when the flag drops.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.520
(laughing):
Whoa.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.890
Gentlemen, start your engines.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.625
Guys, we're still not
getting the number used

30:26.658 --> 30:28.127
by Smokescreen's
car hacking tool.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.062
All right, look,
I have another idea.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.163
If I can get inside
Smokescreen's car,

30:31.197 --> 30:33.299
I can get the serial number
off the SIM card itself.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.134
Elijah could track down
the cell phone on the other end.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.602
Nelson, that is too risky.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.037
Avery, that might be
our only shot.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.139
NELSON:
I got this. We know Smokescreen

30:40.172 --> 30:43.009
can only see
directly in front and behind.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.343
Huge blind spot
on both sides.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.978
I just need a distraction.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.279
How's this for a distraction?

30:50.249 --> 30:51.450
(spectators
cheering, whooping)

30:58.958 --> 31:00.259
All right, it's not
underneath the steering wheel.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.065
(muttering frantically)

31:06.098 --> 31:07.533
It's not in the glove box,
either.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.669
It has to be in here somewhere.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.104
Nelson, what's taking so long?

31:13.172 --> 31:14.941
RYAN:
Nelson, the race

31:14.974 --> 31:16.008
is about to start.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.880
Nelson, get out of there
right now.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.283
Aah!

31:31.690 --> 31:33.960
Krummy, go, go!

31:33.993 --> 31:35.995
You have to race to keep him
from ditching his cell.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.598
I'm going, I'm going.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.968
I just didn't want to hit
that sexy flag lady.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.169
There has to be a car hacking
tool in here somewhere.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.337
You need a physical device
to manipulate the accelerator.

31:45.371 --> 31:48.540
Not every car.
Auto park assist,

31:48.574 --> 31:50.342
which networks
the computer

31:50.376 --> 31:52.544
to the accelerator.
Yeah, he's got it.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.014
KRUMITZ:
Which means Smokescreen
could just remotely

31:55.047 --> 31:56.682
intrude without ever
getting near the car.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.684
Also means there's
no car hacking tool in here.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.153
That's why we didn't pick
anything up on the cell catcher.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.355
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Whoa!

32:04.090 --> 32:06.425
Whoa! Oh!

32:11.197 --> 32:13.132
Krummy, Krummy, heads up!

32:14.766 --> 32:16.068
Whoa!
Aah!

32:18.304 --> 32:19.371
He's trying to crash already.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.173
Or take out the competition.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.275
All right, we got an I.D.:
Kevin Cane,

32:23.309 --> 32:26.178
age 23, Hawthorne, California.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.980
Kevin Cane. Yes, okay.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.248
Personal cell.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.649
I am tracking the target's
location right now.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.351
RYAN:
Our target is

32:32.384 --> 32:34.186
five minutes away from here.
I could go after Smokescreen.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.255
Elijah, you could
check on Carmen.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.456
If Paul Martinez has made her,

32:37.489 --> 32:40.326
she could be in big trouble.
But Nelson, Krumitz, tell us

32:40.359 --> 32:41.327
you can end this race.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.728
Yeah, yeah, okay,

32:42.761 --> 32:45.164
we got this-- chances are

32:45.197 --> 32:47.599
his remote intrusion was
through the navigation system.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.401
Can we hack it
and take control?

32:49.435 --> 32:50.269
RAMIREZ:
There's no time for that.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.371
We have to kill
the navigation from

32:52.404 --> 32:53.539
inside the car.
You mean turn it off?

32:53.572 --> 32:54.606
KRUMITZ:
No, no.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.043
You have to disable
the GSM chip.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.277
NELSON: Hey, Krummy!
He has the car

32:58.310 --> 32:59.445
headed straight
for the crowd, bro!

32:59.478 --> 33:02.148
Like Raven said,
no time for that.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.387
(crowd screaming, clamoring)

33:13.459 --> 33:15.027
Whew!

33:15.061 --> 33:17.363
We did it!
He did it! (laughs)

33:18.697 --> 33:20.299
What did you do?

33:20.332 --> 33:23.202
I just needed something metal
to short out the network.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.404
(cheering)

33:39.785 --> 33:41.387
(sirens approaching)

33:49.428 --> 33:51.097
Kevin Cane--

33:51.130 --> 33:54.100
or do you prefer
Smokescreen?

33:54.133 --> 33:56.735
You lost the use of
your legs in a crash

33:56.768 --> 33:59.705
racing Paul Martinez
on this very spot.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.473
That's why
you set him up.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.309
Crashing those cars made you
feel powerful, didn't it?

34:03.342 --> 34:07.346
Crashing is the only thing
I ever enjoyed about racing.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.316
And now I don't even
have to be in the car to do it.

34:10.349 --> 34:11.683
Well, your street racing days

34:11.717 --> 34:14.353
are officially over.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.547
(banging, knocking)

34:46.285 --> 34:48.387
(muffled grunting)

34:49.388 --> 34:50.889
Let's get you out of here.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.424
Here...

34:58.230 --> 34:59.198
(muffled yell)

35:17.216 --> 35:18.484
I dare you to try something.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.120
I've been dying to shoot you.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.699
Thanks, you know,
for blowing my cover

35:33.732 --> 35:35.334
and almost getting me killed.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.570
And here I thought
I just saved your life.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.506
I'm pretty sure
I saved yours, too.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.541
Nah, I had him
right where I wanted him.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.543
We'll call it even, then.

35:44.576 --> 35:48.247
Actually...

35:48.280 --> 35:49.381
now we're even.

35:49.415 --> 35:52.318
Decrypted the files you gave
us from Paul's hard drive.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.320
Evidence of offshore accounts

35:54.353 --> 35:56.522
he was using to launder money
along with personal e-mails

35:56.555 --> 35:58.590
to his suppliers in Mexico.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.426
D.A.'s gonna wonder
how I got the evidence.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.728
Tell him the truth: FBI Cyber.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.397
Paul Martinez was our
suspect as Smokescreen,

36:05.431 --> 36:07.599
so we searched his devices.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.336
That, along with
the attempted murder

36:10.369 --> 36:12.238
of an undercover officer
and a federal agent,

36:12.271 --> 36:14.172
should put him away
for a very long time.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.524
*

36:42.401 --> 36:44.670
*

37:09.595 --> 37:11.263
Daniel...

37:11.297 --> 37:13.899
we need to talk.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.768
Uh...
RUSSELL: Oh, I'm sorry.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.537
This a bad time?

37:18.570 --> 37:19.771
No. Not at all.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.508
I'm just-just hanging
with my new friend.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.444
Artie.
Hi, Artie.

37:25.477 --> 37:28.480
Sir. Uh, uh...

37:28.514 --> 37:30.482
nothing suspicious
going on in here at all.

37:30.516 --> 37:31.983
Definitely not,
um, abusing

37:32.017 --> 37:34.453
FBI resources for personal gain.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.021
Shut up, Artie.
Right.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.657
Daniel, now why are you removing

37:38.690 --> 37:40.959
all the springs from our pens?

37:41.660 --> 37:43.495
Me?

37:43.529 --> 37:47.299
I found a lot of partial prints
in our reference database

37:47.333 --> 37:49.335
that match to you.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.503
(weak, anxious laugh)

37:51.537 --> 37:53.539
Daniel...?

37:55.541 --> 37:57.976
The pen springs are for our
prototype's mechanical claw.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.712
We needed about 100 or so,
and nobody here uses pens.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.515
Nobody except me.
What is that thing?

38:03.549 --> 38:04.950
It's a battle robot--

38:04.983 --> 38:06.885
a remote-controlled
armored killing machine

38:06.918 --> 38:08.320
designed for
arena combat.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.088
And one day,
our only line of defense

38:10.121 --> 38:11.557
against the intelligent
robot armies

38:11.590 --> 38:13.859
we'll inadvertently
create.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.927
Well, everybody
needs a hobby.

38:17.629 --> 38:18.964
All right...

38:18.997 --> 38:20.566
Oh!
There we go.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.904
Oh!

38:25.937 --> 38:28.940
Oh, yeah.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.609
May I?
Smash that thing!
Smash that...

38:33.779 --> 38:34.713
(laughing)

38:36.615 --> 38:38.684
That's the claw
coming after...
Ooh-hoo! Ow!

38:40.952 --> 38:42.554
(laughing)

38:42.588 --> 38:43.822
It's fun, right?

38:45.557 --> 38:47.426
KRUMITZ:
Doing a 360, 360, 360...

38:47.459 --> 38:49.461
Just smash it, man.
Just smash that!

38:49.495 --> 38:51.530
(laughing)

38:56.568 --> 38:57.669
Welcome back, Agent Ryan.

38:57.703 --> 38:58.670
Director Silver.

38:58.704 --> 38:59.938
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know you were coming.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.507
I was in the building.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.974
Giving another tour?

39:03.008 --> 39:05.544
No, no. Those aren't
necessary anymore.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.880
So you found a new
deputy director?

39:08.914 --> 39:11.550
Yes, I believe we have.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.620
You.

39:15.654 --> 39:16.955
Sir, with all due respect,

39:16.988 --> 39:18.890
I told you that I need
to stay in the field.

39:18.924 --> 39:22.060
You know, I was here when
your team was driving a car

39:22.093 --> 39:23.729
from across the country.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.696
That's pretty fascinating stuff.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.065
And you tracked down
the person responsible.

39:27.098 --> 39:30.502
A hacker in a wheelchair,
from what I read in the report.

39:30.536 --> 39:33.772
A street racer
that injured himself in a crash.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.707
He got a computer science degree

39:35.741 --> 39:38.777
so he could
terrorize the streets.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.079
Avery, there's no other person
for the job of deputy director.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.114
You want to stay
in the field,

39:43.148 --> 39:44.550
you stay in the field.

39:44.583 --> 39:47.052
But I want you
to run this division.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.920
So... Cyber is yours.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.957
Because, this time,
I won't take no for an answer.

39:59.865 --> 40:00.866
(laughs quietly)
