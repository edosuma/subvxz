WEBVTT

00:02.919 --> 00:04.838
(narrator): Previously on Ride.

00:04.879 --> 00:07.549
- You do what you
did here today, Cheyenne,
five months from now,

00:07.590 --> 00:09.467
you and I are gonna be
doing business together.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.344
- I'd like to see you again,
if you're okay with that.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.180
- What then, Gus, huh? You gonna
kick us all to the curb?

00:14.222 --> 00:16.808
- All I got's my word. I won't
stay where I'm not welcome,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.685
so, thank you for dinner.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.354
- Why won't you be honest with
us? Or at least level with me.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.231
- I gotta see these dance moves,
cowboy. Let's go.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.025
- Let's make you a champion.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.484
- I'm ready as ever, Coach.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.611
- I was in debt
to Tucker Clarke.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.447
It's why I had to leave
the way that I did.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.574
- Everything's out
in the open now.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.660
(serene music)

00:40.248 --> 00:43.209
- Red sky at night,
sailor delight.

00:43.251 --> 00:46.546
- Red sky at morning,
sailors take warning.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.381
- Mm-hmm.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.468
- The light rain has stopped and
the Doppler says clear skies.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.595
- Um-mm. Dopplers can be wrong.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.556
- We've got just a hundred
bales to get in.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.059
- Yeah, we can't afford
to lose a single one.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.478
- I got it. We got it.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.688
Val's pulling in
the tractor now.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.941
I offered my help.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.319
- Look, I would be mad
as hell too.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.447
- Four IDs, four states,
four different names--

01:12.489 --> 01:14.949
- Which you never
should have seen.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.118
Look, you need to repair this.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.205
Apologies unspoken,
keep things broken.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.499
(chuckling)

01:22.540 --> 01:24.376
- Is that more
of your sailor wisdom?

01:25.251 --> 01:28.380
- That is pure
Isabel McMurray.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.633
You know, we're really tough.
Do it soon.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.260
(mellow music)

01:36.763 --> 01:40.100
- As honoured as I am to be your
plus-one, what's the plan?

01:40.141 --> 01:43.520
- Uh, well, we get you talking
to JB face to face.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.146
- And then?

01:45.188 --> 01:48.358
- It's just about reminding him,
you know, who you are.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.194
- You want me to send my resume
as well? JB knows who I am.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.571
- Hence, the reminding
part of the plan.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.241
We just want to keep him
excited for Cheyenne.

01:56.282 --> 01:59.244
This is a good opportunity
and you could use the face time.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.620
- You could have been
my face time.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.497
I could've stayed back,
helped with the baling.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.165
- Oh, Tuff and Valeria
got it covered.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.834
- You know I'm no good
at this stuff, right?

02:05.875 --> 02:08.670
- It's just a casual barbecue,
there's nothing to be good at.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.338
- Yeah, well, feels
like a barbecue in here.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.424
(mellow country music)

02:22.517 --> 02:23.810
(sighing)

02:23.852 --> 02:25.061
- Hey, Val?

02:25.103 --> 02:26.688
(exhaling deeply)

02:26.730 --> 02:28.314
Can I say something?

02:28.356 --> 02:30.025
- No one's stopping you.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.985
- Look, I'm sorry but I--

02:32.027 --> 02:33.862
- Sorry with a but,
ain't a sorry.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.575
- Then, how's the oil doing?
- It's fine.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.326
- Last time I checked,
it was running low.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.662
- Tuff.
(door closing)

02:42.704 --> 02:43.913
- I was just trying to...

02:43.955 --> 02:46.374
(tense music)

02:46.416 --> 02:49.127
I am just trying to apologize.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.879
- What did you expect?

02:52.339 --> 02:53.590
I got work to do.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.261
- Maybe you should have
invited your picnic buddy.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.347
- I invited him to your
mom's harvest dinner.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.639
There's always plenty of food

03:01.681 --> 03:03.350
and he doesn't have
any family in town, so.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.353
What?

03:06.394 --> 03:10.023
- Hudson Cooper's headed to
a barbecue. It's on his story.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.192
- Well, it can't be at JB's

03:12.233 --> 03:13.651
because he's with Angler Jeans,
so, it's fine.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.279
- Yeah, what if he switched
to Frontier?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.531
I mean, there goes our chance
at a sponsorship

03:18.573 --> 03:21.868
and we're driving three hours
to a barbecue for nothing.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.537
- Hey, Hudson is good,

03:24.579 --> 03:27.082
but he lost to Austin
every single rodeo.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.293
And you can maintain
that track record, okay?

03:31.378 --> 03:33.254
We got nothing to worry about.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.968
- Hey, you need some
help with dinner?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.720
- Nah. You got enough
on your plate

03:40.762 --> 03:43.556
without having to deal
with the annual harvest dinner.

03:43.598 --> 03:47.227
Keeping it simple this year.
Just ribs and coleslaw.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.062
- Well, I love ribs
and coleslaw.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.772
- Yeah, well... Tell Tuff that

03:50.814 --> 03:52.565
when he's looking for
my twice-baked potatoes.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.317
- Tuff.
- The Doppler's shifted.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.569
- Wait, what?
- Rain is coming.

03:56.611 --> 04:00.657
And it's coming fast.
It's gonna hit us hard
and it's here tonight.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.082
We can get at least half
the bales in by then.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.126
- We need more than half.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.253
- I've got Nic, Steve
and the boys.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.838
We could ask Cash
and Missy.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.465
- You know, they're probably
at JB's already.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.759
- Yeah, but we don't
need more manpower,

04:19.801 --> 04:22.846
we need another tractor.
- What about Tiny Dancer?

04:22.887 --> 04:24.431
(sighing)
- She's junk.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.433
- We haven't used her
in ten years.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.354
- All right, look.
We have a field full of hay

04:31.396 --> 04:33.648
that is about to be
destroyed by rain

04:33.690 --> 04:35.859
and we cannot afford to lose
a single piece of it.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.318
- We'll give it a shot.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.904
- Yeah, well, some things
are just beyond repair.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.450
- Stop jumping to conclusions.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.577
They're probably hundreds
of barbecues happening

04:45.618 --> 04:47.495
all across Colorado right now.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.831
- Oh, less now that rain's
expected over half the state.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.083
- In Canyon?
- Mm-hmm.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.086
- Okay, well, by the time
we would even get home,
they'll probably be done.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.131
We are more help here trying
to secure you a sponsorship.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.216
- Secure. Yeah,
wasn't even invited.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.594
Hudson. Hudson's probably
the reason.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.763
- Would you stop, please.
And you were invited.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.057
- Yeah, by you.
Now I'm being dragged along.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.477
- Austin. Your ride's in Reno...

05:10.518 --> 05:13.396
(chuckling)
You make it looks so easy.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.648
- Well, you know,
I wish it were.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.902
Oh, now I've been cravin'
JB's burgers all year.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.237
So when are you gonna
give me the recipe, huh?

05:21.279 --> 05:23.365
- Like I'd give it away
for free if I knew.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.033
- Well, a man's gotta try,
don't he?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.659
Hey, you met my wife,
haven't you?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.495
- Of course, it's Melissa,
right?

05:28.536 --> 05:30.538
- Ah, no, Missy.
- But it's short for Melissa?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.499
- No.
(chuckling)

05:32.540 --> 05:34.209
- We'll see you out there,
Suzy Q.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.669
Enjoy.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.713
Missy... I have a bone
to pick with you.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.508
- I know, I know. I know,
the promo.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.343
- It was a success.
- Oh.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.345
- You're such an "it girl".
People are ecstatic

05:45.387 --> 05:47.055
just to see you canter
around a ring.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.558
But... you owe me a trick ride.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.893
- Hi.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.187
- Oh, sorry.
Uh, Susan, you remember Cash?

05:54.229 --> 05:57.482
- Of course I remember you,
Cash McMurray. It's been years.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.485
- Yeah. It's some barbecue.

06:00.527 --> 06:04.114
- I have to tell you,
both of you,

06:04.155 --> 06:06.449
how much we miss Austin.

06:07.075 --> 06:10.245
- Thank you, Susan.
- Of course.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.456
- It's gonna be great.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.837
- Hello, hello.
- Hey.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.881
I hope you brought me
my whipped cream.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.925
- It's not my first rodeo.
(chuckling)

06:23.967 --> 06:27.220
Okay. Where we at?
- Well, I got the first bowl

06:27.262 --> 06:29.389
of coleslaw going in the fridge

06:29.431 --> 06:31.349
and ribs are over there
marinating.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.393
- Twice-baked potatoes?
Macaroni salad?

06:33.435 --> 06:35.061
- Nope.
- Baked beans?

06:35.103 --> 06:38.231
- Nah. Rain's coming.
Don't have time for sides.

06:38.273 --> 06:42.736
- Okay. Well, can I help?
Carrot souffle is my specialty.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.905
- Go with a simpler menu, okay?
There you go. Thanks.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.241
- Okay.
- Just throw those on the table.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.578
- Better for my waistline.
(chuckling)

06:52.954 --> 06:55.915
You know, Isabel,
it could be stone soup...

06:55.957 --> 06:59.127
As long as you're cooking,
it'll be five-star.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.133
- You and that Cheshire grin.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.594
Hank Hickson,
what are you up to?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.971
- Oh, I got news.
- Oh, yeah?

07:10.805 --> 07:13.266
- Isabel, after all these years,
I've finally found it.

07:14.017 --> 07:17.312
The perfect location
for Canyon Colorado's

07:17.354 --> 07:20.315
World Class Rodeo Stadium.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.610
(scoffing)
- You still chasing that dream?

07:23.651 --> 07:25.737
(chuckling)
- Land's already been surveyed,

07:25.779 --> 07:28.281
blueprints are drawn.
- Yeah, you know what else

07:28.323 --> 07:30.033
it takes to build
something like that?

07:30.075 --> 07:32.327
- Yup. Investors.
- Right.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.579
- Belle, rodeo is bigger
than it's ever been.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.373
I mean the way
the world is today,

07:36.414 --> 07:37.624
people need
a sense of belonging.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.292
They need to belong
to a community

07:39.334 --> 07:40.752
that celebrates real life.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.047
- Mm? That's your whole pitch?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.757
- People need hope.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.677
- Okay. This is gonna be
a bad storm.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.014
I can feel it in my bones.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.183
- Well, the guest list
is smaller than I thought.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.310
- I told you. Super cash.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.647
- Hey, there is our rival
bull rider at twelve o'clock.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.857
- Oh, my.
- I knew it!

08:02.899 --> 08:04.901
I told you he was gonna be
at this barbecue.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.112
(exhaling deeply)
(indistinct chattering)

08:07.153 --> 08:08.488
Hudson.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.323
- I didn't expect to see you.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.158
So soon after the Rocky
Mountain Rodeo.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.785
- Yeah, same here.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.662
- Yeah, is Angler okay
with you being here?

08:15.704 --> 08:18.164
- Oh, totally fine 'cause
I'm not with them anymore.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.833
- Oh.
- Wow.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.378
- Yeah. Ultimately just wasn't
a good fit. Their jeans either.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.338
- Ha.
- Have to admit,

08:25.380 --> 08:28.842
I almost regretted
walking for a moment,
but then JB called and...

08:28.883 --> 08:31.428
- Wait, he called you?
- Last-minute invite.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.180
But hey, clearly I'm not
the only one he called.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.890
- That's right.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.309
- Hopefully, there's room
in the budget for both of us.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.603
I'm gonna go grab something
to eat. Good to see you.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.188
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

08:43.189 --> 08:46.735
- Goodbye. He gets a phone call.
JB doesn't even know I'm here.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.611
(sighing)
- You are just getting back

08:48.653 --> 08:50.363
on the circuit.
- Hudson's a hell of a rider.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.449
- So are you.
- I'm here as a plus-one.

08:52.490 --> 08:56.077
- Okay, okay, look. Yes, Hudson
is hot on the circuit right now,

08:56.119 --> 08:59.372
but you are the hero
that rodeo was made for.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.332
You've got resilience,
humility--

09:01.374 --> 09:02.876
- Humility? Wow--

09:02.917 --> 09:04.461
- Now that was
a bit of a stretch.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.671
But resilience is the name of
Frontier's new men's line, so.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.173
- This whole brand
ambassador thing.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.841
(clicks tongue)
Really working out for ya.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.885
- Yeah. For both of us. 'Kay?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.220
We're not gonna give up
without a fight.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.222
Now come one, I see JB.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.933
- This is my life.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.230
- Mr. Wooten.
- Missy.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.108
- Your backyard gets more
and more beautiful every year.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.194
What, do you have Mother Nature
in your pocket or something?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.237
- That's the only employee
giving me grief.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.031
And she's still winning
the hearts of our customers.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.075
- Yes, well, to make up for it,
I brought you a gift.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.660
- Yes, I can see that. Nice
surprise to see you here, Cash.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.662
- Just doing what
my coach here says.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.582
- Well, you're a lucky guy.
- Yeah. No, I know.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.584
But I intend to impress you
at Cheyenne.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.211
- Hmm?
- Ah, remember you said that

09:46.252 --> 09:47.921
we'd be in business if--
- Well, there he is.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.422
- These burgers are so good,

09:49.464 --> 09:51.091
I might just agree
to get paid with them.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.468
- Well, that can be arranged.
- Well, you already signed then?

09:53.510 --> 09:54.886
Welcome to the family.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.764
- Missy actually just signed
with Frontier as well.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.516
- Well, I'm just a brand
ambassador.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.101
- There's nothing
"just" about it.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.894
It's not official until
it's official.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.479
Still, wouldn't hurt
to talk some strategy.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.773
- I've got plenty of ideas, Sir.
- Well, it's good to hear.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.358
You wouldn't mind...
- Of course.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.026
- Yep.
(exhaling deeply)

10:11.695 --> 10:13.863
- Just save it.
- Oh, my God.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.782
- Okay. Can you try it now?

10:15.824 --> 10:17.784
(engine sputtering)

10:19.786 --> 10:21.246
- Doesn't sound so good.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.290
- Val's tried everything.
- Thanks a lot.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.459
- It was a compliment.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.169
- You don't trust me
with anything.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.505
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- All right, enough.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.132
Just tell me, can you fix it?
- Of course.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.383
- No.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.676
Not without new fuel filters.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.928
- All right, you call
every mechanic you know,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.680
and you, we're gonna need
to use your truck.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.640
- I can make calls too.
- No. I'll make the calls,

10:40.682 --> 10:42.100
you get your truck.
- My truck's not gonna make

10:42.142 --> 10:43.810
a dent in anything.
- Yes it--

10:43.852 --> 10:45.353
- Listen, hey, hey.
Stop bickering.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.313
Figure out a way to work
together and get this done,

10:47.355 --> 10:50.150
or otherwise we're gonna
be hit with a $20,000 bill
we can't afford.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.443
(tense music)

10:51.484 --> 10:53.028
(sighing)

11:07.375 --> 11:10.587
- Yeah, that's it. Just a bit
further now. Come on.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.089
We caught a real break with
the sun for a few hours, huh?

11:13.131 --> 11:15.925
- Yeah, we sure did.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.803
- Tuff.
- All right, beauty.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.516
- I'm here to help, guys.
- In that little thing?

11:23.558 --> 11:25.894
- Two bales is better
than nothing.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.771
- Yeah, you know what hay
costs now?

11:27.812 --> 11:29.856
- Exactly. Every bale we save

11:29.898 --> 11:31.775
is one that we don't have
to pay for come winter.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.777
And Val's still working
on Tiny Dancer.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.362
- There's a lost cause.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.655
- Yeah, I'm gonna go see
if Val needs some help.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.949
(country guitar music)

11:43.995 --> 11:46.956
- Your memory is getting
alarmingly short, Belle.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.376
- Sometimes, I wish
it was shorter.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.045
- You know, this stadium,
it wasn't just mine

11:52.087 --> 11:53.880
and Dusty's dream, you know?

11:54.881 --> 11:57.467
- Hank, don't drag me into this.
Just don't.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.970
- Oh, I seem to remember
the Rodeo Roundup Gift Shop,

12:01.012 --> 12:06.017
'cause everybody's gonna
want a keychain or a shot glass
or a stuffed animal.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.312
Belle, it was a good idea then,
it's a good idea now.

12:09.354 --> 12:13.191
- Look, Hank, you want to do
this, you do this. But I...

12:13.233 --> 12:16.069
I don't have it in me
to talk about some old dream

12:16.111 --> 12:19.280
that celebrates a sport that has
given me nothing but grief.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.241
- Hi.
- Mm.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.326
- Hey, when I heard,
I came as fast as I could.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.786
- You called him?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.454
- Is that the one
you're looking for?

12:26.496 --> 12:28.373
- Yeah. Those are the ones.
You're a godsend.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.875
You wanna get them to Val so she
can get them in that old girl.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.669
Thank you, thank you.
- What did you bring?

12:32.711 --> 12:35.046
- Tracked down a couple
of fuel filters.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.550
- Those filters...
those, my dream.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.386
(exhaling sharply)

12:42.971 --> 12:45.807
- Okay, well, I don't want
to hover so...

12:45.849 --> 12:48.810
Is there anything else I can do?
- Uh, sure, sure.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.146
Why don't you dig in the barn,

12:51.187 --> 12:53.440
see if there's any more tarps.
Thanks, okay.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.108
And, Hank...

12:55.150 --> 12:57.193
Why don't you go check
on the ribs?

12:57.235 --> 12:59.446
- Will do.
- Thanks, okay.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.864
Uh, how's it going?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.532
(engine sputtering)

13:02.574 --> 13:04.367
(groaning)

13:04.409 --> 13:06.119
- Oh, come on! Ugh!

13:06.161 --> 13:10.373
Well, forget curveballs,
life just kicked us in the gut.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.168
I don't get it, they're primed,
it should work.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.337
- Well, you think it could be
something else?

13:15.378 --> 13:19.049
- The pump? That would
set us back about four grand.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.468
- Oh, God.
(exhaling deeply)

13:21.509 --> 13:24.387
- Hey. How can I help?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.931
- Dude, I wish I knew.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.018
- Let's get out of here. Okay?

13:30.060 --> 13:31.353
We'll go home
where we're needed.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.063
- No. We're not gonna be
any use at home,

13:33.104 --> 13:35.106
other than moral support.
Come on.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.067
What did you tell me
about trick riding, huh?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.443
If it was easy, then everybody--
- Missy.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.986
I really don't need
a pep talk right now.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.488
JB's got his golden boy.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.406
- It's not over until
the ink is dry, okay?

13:43.448 --> 13:45.950
Hudson has been out there
on the circuit proving himself

13:45.992 --> 13:47.994
and you just need a shot
to do the same.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.704
So come on, let's go
and take it.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.456
(sighing)

13:56.378 --> 13:58.213
(indistinct chatter)

14:11.267 --> 14:12.352
- Hey there.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.062
- You're a little early
for dinner.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.773
- Even I know rain's not good
for hay. Can I help?

14:16.815 --> 14:20.276
- Not unless you can lift
a one tonne bale of hay
without a tractor.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.530
- What about that old 2470
by the tool shop?

14:23.571 --> 14:26.783
- That was my dad's.
Now an expensive lawn ornament.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.786
- It needs a new fuel pump
and there ain't one for 100
miles from here.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.788
- Mind if I take a look at it?

14:31.830 --> 14:33.498
I might be able to help
turn it over.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.874
(scoffing)
- With what,

14:34.916 --> 14:36.251
a thousand-dollar bill?
- Sure.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.752
We need all
the help we can get.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.045
(sighing)

14:40.547 --> 14:43.133
(upbeat country music)

14:45.468 --> 14:47.971
- When I was in Dayton,
it was raining cats and dogs.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.973
But I still went out there.
- Oh, I remember that.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.600
You were riding Bubba.
He's a spinner.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.395
- You saw me ride, huh?
- Yeah, of course.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.313
But you know,
with a bull like Bubba,

14:57.355 --> 14:59.816
you probably wanna transfer
your weight inside the spin.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.568
(chuckling)

15:01.609 --> 15:03.069
- I made it to the whistle,
didn't I?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.863
- Yeah, but you
sacrificed points

15:04.904 --> 15:06.072
because you were
workin' so hard.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.283
Same thing happened
to you in Tucson.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.160
- What'd I do in Tucson?

15:10.201 --> 15:12.620
- Yeah, that one was a bit
more of a hip issue.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.749
Actually, you know what?
I need a drink. Walk with me.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.544
(indistinct chatter)

15:25.884 --> 15:27.802
- I think that one might
need to be flipped.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.641
- Thank you.

15:36.561 --> 15:41.274
- So, uh... You a one flip per
patty kinda griller or... ?

15:41.316 --> 15:43.526
- Is that a trick question?

15:43.568 --> 15:46.071
Every purist knows
it's one flip per patty.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.865
- Oh, but I'm not a purist.
- No?

15:48.907 --> 15:50.950
- I'm a 15 seconds per flip.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.203
- You flip 'em every 15 seconds?
- Yup.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.954
- Well, you know
what that tells me?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.206
It tells me you're
a nervous flipper.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.458
Bad sign for a bull rider, Son.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.755
- You know, as a marine,
when we weren't running

16:03.797 --> 16:05.632
combat operations
outside the wire,

16:05.674 --> 16:07.676
we had a little spare time.

16:07.717 --> 16:11.471
Got to test some theories.
It turns out multiple flips

16:11.513 --> 16:13.473
meant less grill time
by about two minutes.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.184
- Really?

16:16.810 --> 16:18.353
- I need a drink.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.441
- So, it was my left
or my right hip?

16:26.361 --> 16:27.570
Missy?

16:30.782 --> 16:32.784
(tense music)

16:50.802 --> 16:51.845
Missy?

16:53.054 --> 16:54.180
Missy?

16:54.222 --> 16:57.976
- Uh, I'm sorry,
I can't remember.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.644
Um, you should watch your tapes.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.105
(indistinct chatter)

17:02.147 --> 17:03.523
Excuse me.

17:05.608 --> 17:09.029
Mary. I love your writing
in Rodeo Riders Weekly.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.488
Missy McMurray.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.157
- Of course.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.617
- Susan.
- Missy.

17:15.994 --> 17:20.206
- You know, when Granddaddy
started Rodeo Riders Weekly,

17:20.248 --> 17:23.918
all those years ago,
I just know he was thinking

17:23.960 --> 17:27.422
of people like your daddy
and Austin.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.468
That boy was a charmer.
- Hmm.

17:31.509 --> 17:35.972
Yeah, well, Cash may be
a little rough around the edges,

17:36.014 --> 17:37.891
but he's the real deal.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.642
- Knows his way
around a grill too.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.770
- Well, you just gave me
the name of my autobiography.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.606
Rough and Real Cash McMurray:
Guide to Grillin'.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.776
- Or the name of a
Rodeo Riders article.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.363
Cash is also a really good
human interest story.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.073
You know, back from the marines,

17:53.114 --> 17:54.949
getting back to his
bull riding roots.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.618
- I'm just a regular guy
on a bull.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.745
- Yeah, but, Bullet is not
your typical bull.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.497
- You're training on Bullet?

18:00.538 --> 18:03.166
- I hope, though sometimes,
it feels like he's training me,

18:03.208 --> 18:06.044
but... Yeah, we're finding ways
of communicating.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.004
- What's to communicate?
It's man versus beast.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.423
- Yeah, I think it's a little
more complicated than that.

18:10.465 --> 18:14.219
- It's true. So tell me,
how do you beat the enemy?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.596
- That bull is not
my enemy. He's...

18:18.473 --> 18:20.392
He's more like a dance partner.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.353
- I like that, Cash.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.897
Now that's an article.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.607
- If that article has a photo,

18:27.649 --> 18:29.859
you know what brand of jeans
he's gonna be wearing.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.736
(chuckling)

18:38.493 --> 18:41.246
You got yourself a P.R. manager.
I mean, that article...

18:41.287 --> 18:43.623
- I know. I'm as surprised
as you were.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.293
- I'm not. I mean,
Dusty and Austin were legends.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.338
You know, what's in them
is in you too.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.590
- I've been working
real hard for Cheyenne.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.011
- Yeah, it's just that's
a while off, isn't it?

18:56.052 --> 18:57.846
We do have some
decisions to make.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.390
- Ah, well, we could
compete sooner.

19:00.432 --> 19:01.975
- Yeah? Could you be ready
for Denver?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.685
- Well, that's in a week.
- Yeah.

19:03.727 --> 19:04.978
- Yeah?
- Of course, yeah.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.604
- All right then.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.982
I'll see you there.
- Mm-hmm.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.066
- You too, coach.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.569
- Are you insane?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.487
- You said not to give up
without a fight.

19:14.529 --> 19:17.157
- He just upped our timeline
by four months.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.242
- Yeah. Now, I'm back
in the running.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.535
(sighs)

19:21.953 --> 19:22.996
(horn honking)

19:24.622 --> 19:25.957
(grunting)

19:25.999 --> 19:28.668
- Okay. Huh, all right.
That should work.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.921
- So, I figured we could
save some of the bales
if we tarp them.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.506
- We don't have enough tarps
for this.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.258
Our man power
is better used hauling in.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.384
Now let's go, Nic.

19:36.426 --> 19:37.677
- No, Nic, I need
your help here.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.095
- 'Kay, hold on,
who's in charge here?

19:39.137 --> 19:40.305
(both): I am.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.473
- There can only be one boss.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.016
Ya'll gotta decide.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.684
Till then, let me know.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.269
I'm gonna go see
how Gus is doing.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.229
(sighing)

19:48.271 --> 19:49.814
- Val, we're wasting
precious seconds here.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.275
- Then stop fighting me and
start listening to me for once.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.778
Why can't you just trust me?
- I'm sorry. Okay?

19:54.819 --> 19:56.363
How many times
do I have to say it?

19:56.404 --> 19:57.947
- You went through
my things, Tuff!

19:57.989 --> 20:00.992
You didn't even try
to talk to me first.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.911
- I did. Like a hundred times,

20:02.952 --> 20:04.579
but you were never
gonna listen to me.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.331
I was never gonna
get through to you.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.665
And you know how I know?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.376
Because we used
to be best friends.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.211
Unless you've forgotten.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.754
'Cause I haven't.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.423
I never did.

20:15.465 --> 20:18.218
And when I needed you the most,
you weren't there.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.303
I went looking for you.

20:20.345 --> 20:24.391
You had no friends to call
or no family to track you down.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.060
My best friend
was gone overnight.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.939
And all that trust was broken.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.200
(scoffing)

20:42.242 --> 20:44.661
- Fourteen.

20:44.703 --> 20:49.708
At this rate, half our horse
hay'll be soaking wet tomorrow.

20:51.042 --> 20:54.587
- Whatever you do salvage,
it'll be high-quality stuff.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.090
Unlike those fuel filters,
I brought you earlier.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.342
- Hey, look,
it was worth a shot.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.927
- Well...

21:03.138 --> 21:05.932
So, uh, what's your secret?

21:05.974 --> 21:07.475
- What?

21:07.517 --> 21:10.020
- What's your secret...

21:10.061 --> 21:12.272
with the fertilizer?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.858
(chuckling)

21:14.899 --> 21:16.943
- Ah, well,
I'm not telling you.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.487
But let's just say
it involves eggshells.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.156
- Eggshells?
- Yes, eggshells.

21:21.197 --> 21:24.367
- And maybe some coffee grounds?
- I'm not saying.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.369
I am not saying.
- I was gonna say--

21:26.411 --> 21:27.996
- Cody, you wanna
give us a minute?

21:29.664 --> 21:32.167
- What is it, Hank?
What do you need?

21:32.208 --> 21:33.835
- Now look...

21:34.878 --> 21:37.797
I know that you keep saying
that rodeo's givin' you nothing,

21:37.839 --> 21:39.591
nothing but grief.
- Oh, come on.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.093
- But Dusty would have been
proud to know that his pages

21:42.135 --> 21:45.013
and pages of notes are gonna
come to fruition.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.935
- You have Dusty's notes?
- Yep.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.229
He drew up some plans
for a water park too,

21:53.271 --> 21:54.731
but that's more
phase-two thinking.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.653
- You know, when Dusty passed,
everything that was his,

22:00.695 --> 22:03.573
became mine.
Awards, memorabilia...

22:03.615 --> 22:05.700
- It was the legacy.
- Uh-huh.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.912
I want those notes.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.165
(exhaling slowly)

22:12.207 --> 22:13.667
(horn honking)

22:22.217 --> 22:25.762
- Now, I'm not talking
about a paddock and a couple
of out buildings here.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.681
- Nic, you wanna hand me
that wrench.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.933
- No, no, no. I'm talking about
a world-class stadium

22:29.974 --> 22:31.935
that'll draw people
in their thick wallets,

22:31.976 --> 22:34.521
from across the country. Maybe
even from around the world.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.606
- It's a great idea.
- Yeah, I can't believe Canyon

22:36.648 --> 22:38.358
doesn't have one yet.
- Well, it will.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.276
I got the land,
I got the designs.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.278
- Uh, do you see a rag
around here?

22:42.320 --> 22:43.697
- Yeah.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.618
- Thanks. I'd love to look
at them one day. The design.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.121
- Well, great. And I'll do it up
with a proper pitch.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.915
Now listen, this whole project,
it's got a hefty price tag.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.126
But with you as a partner,
I don't really see that
as a problem.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.962
- Oh, no, Hank. If you're
looking for an investment,

22:59.004 --> 23:00.672
you're barking
at the wrong Booker.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.215
You wanna talk to my father.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.384
- Well, you haven't even heard
the best part yet.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.678
This stadium, it's gonna feature
the best riders in the country,

23:06.720 --> 23:10.056
the McMurray men.
Now you just picture Dusty
and Austin's hats,

23:10.098 --> 23:12.642
boots and buckles on display.
The McMurray Museum.

23:12.684 --> 23:13.893
- Brought you guys
some caffeine.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.104
- Isabel, you read my mind.
- Aw, thank you.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.981
- Now, you don't need any.

23:18.982 --> 23:21.401
Cody's gone to get
some more tarps,

23:21.443 --> 23:23.361
but we could really use this.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.781
Come on, old girl.
Why won't you run for us

23:26.823 --> 23:28.616
like you did for Dusty, huh?

23:29.159 --> 23:30.452
Here you go.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.329
All right. Hank.

23:33.371 --> 23:34.664
- Hmm?

23:34.706 --> 23:36.875
- One of your pies is off.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.130
- Still not getting
the hang out of this.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.800
(grunting)

23:45.842 --> 23:48.345
- You know why I'm just
having coleslaw and ribs?

23:48.386 --> 23:51.014
- The rain?
- Because I am pinching

23:51.056 --> 23:52.766
every penny while you're running
around pinching

23:52.807 --> 23:54.976
"pie in the sky" ideas.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.187
- Wait a minute, is there
something wrong with my pies?

23:57.228 --> 24:02.233
- Hank. It's my ranch.
You're using my name.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.903
- I am trying to help.

24:04.944 --> 24:08.281
- With what? With what,
a McMurray Museum?

24:08.323 --> 24:12.494
- Dusty wanted this.
You wanted it too at some point.

24:12.535 --> 24:15.205
- Yeah, but look. Yes, yes!
And that was when I had Dusty

24:15.246 --> 24:18.124
by my side and I was living
a completely different reality.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.794
And while you have been able to
go on and have your big dreams,

24:20.835 --> 24:23.088
I have had to wake up
every single day

24:23.129 --> 24:25.632
and worry about how I'm gonna
hold onto this ranch

24:25.674 --> 24:29.219
and keep workers happy
with cabbage.

24:29.260 --> 24:33.348
That's what coleslaw is,
it's cheap old cabbage.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.644
- Well, how long do you want to
keep counting pennies, Isabel?

24:37.686 --> 24:39.479
- I just don't want to talk
about this.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.565
- Worrying about the rain.
This could save you from
all that one day.

24:42.607 --> 24:47.112
Isabel, you got all
that memorabilia sittin' up
in the attic rotting,

24:47.153 --> 24:49.280
when it could be put
to good use.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.700
- Not all of it.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.202
Not all of it.

24:54.869 --> 24:59.040
- You... don't even like
to have it out there.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.877
- Here's to upping your training

25:02.919 --> 25:05.547
from morning till night
for the next week.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.340
- Cheers.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.925
(laughing)

25:09.759 --> 25:12.178
Missy, uh--
- You should also make sure

25:12.220 --> 25:14.389
that Nic is available
when Tuff is not.

25:14.431 --> 25:16.266
- Thank you. Seriously.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.851
- Yeah well, thank you too.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.853
Would've been hard
being here without you.

25:19.894 --> 25:21.396
You know, everyone
at these things

25:21.438 --> 25:24.024
always just knows me
as Austin McMurray's widow.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.817
- Not everyone.
- Pardon me.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.866
- Hi, uh, I am Cash, this is--

25:32.907 --> 25:38.329
- Missy McMurray. I'm a big fan
of your husband's.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.623
"Was", I mean.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.668
- Oh, um, thank you.

25:43.710 --> 25:48.757
- So, when did you two,
you know, start?

25:49.341 --> 25:51.217
- Start?

25:51.259 --> 25:52.302
(stammering)
- No.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.803
- Oh. No, no. I'm his coach.

25:53.845 --> 25:56.181
- She's my brother...
I'm her brother-in-law.

25:56.222 --> 26:00.518
- I just thought, you know,
seeing you two together.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.228
- Nope.
- No.

26:02.270 --> 26:03.855
- Hmm. Good to know.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.815
(indistinct chatter)

26:12.364 --> 26:15.158
- Well, that was weird.

26:23.792 --> 26:26.294
(tense music)

26:41.559 --> 26:43.269
Hey.

26:43.311 --> 26:44.771
You okay?

26:44.813 --> 26:48.066
- Uh. I'm just gonna go
to the washroom.

26:51.319 --> 26:57.075
- Uh, excuse me. Um, how did you
know my husband?

26:57.117 --> 26:59.244
- Everyone knew Austin McMurray.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.538
- I know it's just
that you seemed really upset

27:01.579 --> 27:03.081
when you saw me with Cash.
- Oh no.

27:03.123 --> 27:04.958
- Not that we're together,
it's just...

27:05.709 --> 27:09.087
- I guess I can't imagine
getting over

27:09.129 --> 27:14.050
someone like Austin
and just... moving on.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.177
- I remember you.

27:16.219 --> 27:17.762
- I shouldn't have said
anything.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.681
- No, no. Please, wait.
How did you know him?

27:19.723 --> 27:21.725
Because if you have something
to tell me--

27:21.766 --> 27:24.310
- There's nothing,
I... I don't.

27:25.603 --> 27:27.313
You don't want to know.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.659
- Hey. So, I was chatting up
this guy who works

27:39.701 --> 27:41.745
for the Rodeo Riders
Association.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.497
Ah, turns out the woman,
her name is Polly Kerns,

27:44.539 --> 27:46.958
works for him too.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.877
Now she's in the biz,
but I don't know,

27:48.918 --> 27:50.628
maybe lackin'
some social cues.

27:50.670 --> 27:51.713
Even more than me.

27:51.755 --> 27:53.048
(scoffing)

27:55.467 --> 27:56.676
You all right?

27:56.718 --> 27:58.428
- No, um...

27:58.470 --> 27:59.971
No, I need to leave.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.350
- Okay. All right, let's go.

28:03.391 --> 28:05.852
- All right, try it now.

28:05.894 --> 28:07.479
Come on.
(engine starting)

28:07.520 --> 28:09.481
(laughing)

28:09.522 --> 28:11.900
- You did it!
- We did it!

28:13.902 --> 28:18.239
- Ah, no way! How?

28:18.281 --> 28:19.866
- Filters weren't
priming properly,

28:19.908 --> 28:21.576
I figured there might be
air in the lines,

28:21.618 --> 28:22.911
so I cracked it
and bled it out.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.829
- Teamwork makes
the dream work.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.456
- I pumped up the filters,

28:26.498 --> 28:28.541
how did you figure out
that was the problem?

28:28.583 --> 28:31.294
- My granddad. He started
Booker Oil and made it clear,

28:31.336 --> 28:33.588
no free rides, everybody
learns from the ground up.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.383
Spent three summers working
in the mechanic shop.

28:36.424 --> 28:39.928
- Let's quit chatting, let's get
this bale wagon loaded up.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.894
- Well, I guess you're
not just a bank account
with a pretty face.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.896
- Is that a compliment?
- Hey.

28:49.938 --> 28:51.731
I will fight you
tooth and nail to stop you

28:51.773 --> 28:53.191
from investing in this ranch.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.445
The least I can do is hand you
a beer when all this is done.

29:08.707 --> 29:10.333
- Whoa.

29:19.092 --> 29:21.094
- What are you doing?
- Helping you.

29:21.136 --> 29:22.804
I'll even let you
boss me around.

29:22.846 --> 29:25.473
(chuckling)
- Okay. Get on the other side.

29:28.101 --> 29:30.186
(upbeat country music)

29:36.651 --> 29:37.861
(chuckling)

29:37.902 --> 29:39.988
Feels good. Feels good.

29:42.907 --> 29:45.243
- All right, boys,
bring it this way. Come on in.

29:47.078 --> 29:49.247
(indistinct chatter)

29:51.708 --> 29:53.043
- Yeah.
- Dude, we did it!

29:53.084 --> 29:54.502
- All right.

29:58.506 --> 29:59.841
- Doing great.
- Okay.

29:59.883 --> 30:01.634
- First for everything.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.226
- Thank you, everybody. Really.

30:10.268 --> 30:11.644
Couldn't have done it
without you.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.313
- Even Steve?
- Yes.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.607
- Ah, I think we could've done
it without Steve, to be honest.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.817
- Take it easy there,
"Mr. two bales at a time".

30:17.859 --> 30:20.904
- Hey.
- Guys.

30:20.945 --> 30:23.156
I'm gonna enjoy a drink or two.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.825
Dinner will be ready shortly.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.577
- I didn't want one anyway.

30:27.619 --> 30:30.330
I'll go check on the ribs.
Feed these hungry ranchers.

30:30.372 --> 30:32.374
- Now you,
you were a life saver.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.042
- Thank you.

30:34.084 --> 30:37.462
- And Cody, means a lot
that you were here.

30:37.504 --> 30:40.757
- Thank you, Ma'am.
Anything you need, anytime.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.595
- Well, here, cheers.

30:45.637 --> 30:47.722
(indistinct chatter)

30:50.308 --> 30:53.520
- Yeah, you know, I can tell how
much this land means to you.

30:53.561 --> 30:57.732
How much you're...
you're a part of it.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.986
- Just don't know how much
I want to put my husband and son

31:02.028 --> 31:05.407
on display to make a buck.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.951
- Like the McMurray
Rodeo Museum?

31:07.992 --> 31:09.494
(scoffing)
- Just the sound of it

31:09.536 --> 31:11.246
makes my skin crawl.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.666
- They're part of this land too.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.335
The McMurray men, I mean...

31:19.587 --> 31:20.964
They gave it their all.

31:21.006 --> 31:22.882
- Literally.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.427
- I didn't mean it that way.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.262
- I know.

31:27.303 --> 31:33.601
- Just let them... let them
help you save this place.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.401
- How'd we do?

31:41.443 --> 31:46.698
- Tiny Dancer had a busy day.
She got every last bale.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.283
- Thanks.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.334
I can't believe I almost
lost half our crop

31:57.375 --> 31:59.252
because I couldn't trust Gus.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.421
- You didn't trust
the trust fund kid?

32:01.463 --> 32:03.340
(sighing)
It's understandable.

32:03.381 --> 32:06.634
- Yeah, I know, it's just...
I didn't even give him a chance.

32:06.676 --> 32:08.386
(rain pattering)

32:09.512 --> 32:12.098
You know, the first step
to trusting someone

32:12.140 --> 32:14.601
is getting to know them.

32:14.642 --> 32:18.104
- Good thing is,
you know everything there is
to know about me.

32:18.146 --> 32:19.814
- You tend to overshare.

32:19.856 --> 32:21.274
(chuckling)

32:23.151 --> 32:25.904
I wasn't talking about me
knowing you.

32:26.613 --> 32:27.906
- Oh?

32:29.783 --> 32:32.202
- I tend to keep things buried.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.372
Just didn't know how deep.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.665
- Val. If you were gonna
let me in,

32:37.707 --> 32:40.710
you would have done it
years ago. It's fine.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.879
We don't need to be best
friends, we can--

32:42.921 --> 32:46.091
- My mom died when I was 16 and
a big part of me died with her.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.176
(somber music)

32:49.552 --> 32:52.138
I didn't know what to do
with all that pain,

32:52.180 --> 32:54.265
so I just started
running from it.

32:56.768 --> 32:58.353
I've been running ever since.

32:59.771 --> 33:02.273
- That's why you never talked
about your family.

33:04.275 --> 33:07.195
- And when I got to this ranch,
I found a new one...

33:08.988 --> 33:10.448
...that was happy.

33:13.284 --> 33:16.287
And I just went and messed it
all up and hurt everyone.

33:16.329 --> 33:19.499
- Hey. One thing that's true

33:19.541 --> 33:21.835
of all families is
we hurt each other.

33:23.503 --> 33:25.839
But we fight to help
each other too.

33:27.966 --> 33:29.843
I'm sorry about your mom.

33:31.094 --> 33:33.304
What about Dad? Was he...

33:33.346 --> 33:36.391
- Just uh, one story at a time.

33:39.060 --> 33:43.231
- Come on. Let's go get
some grub.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.234
Or Steve will eat all the ribs.

33:46.276 --> 33:47.402
(chuckling)

33:49.029 --> 33:51.364
(thunder rumbling)

34:03.418 --> 34:06.379
- Hey. Missy,
what happened back there?

34:07.672 --> 34:09.799
Is it about that woman Polly?

34:09.841 --> 34:13.011
Who cares if some random woman
thinks that we were on a date.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.846
- I don't think she was random.

34:15.513 --> 34:17.349
- What are you talking about?

34:17.390 --> 34:20.977
- I think she and Austin...

34:21.019 --> 34:23.021
I think maybe they...

34:23.063 --> 34:26.024
I asked her
in so many words if...

34:26.066 --> 34:27.484
- She and Austin?

34:29.194 --> 34:31.363
Oh, no, she's probably
some little crazy fan
messing with you.

34:31.404 --> 34:33.073
- No, she's not some crazy fan.
I remember her.

34:33.114 --> 34:36.743
I saw her at events and stuff.
I saw them talking, that's...

34:36.785 --> 34:37.952
(sighing)

34:39.371 --> 34:41.081
Did he cheat on me?

34:41.122 --> 34:43.750
- No.
- How do you know?

34:43.792 --> 34:45.627
- I just know.

34:46.586 --> 34:49.798
- So, you don't actually
know anything?

34:49.839 --> 34:51.257
(thunder crashing)

34:51.299 --> 34:53.593
- No, but I've been gone
a long time.

34:53.635 --> 34:57.347
- But you guys stayed in touch.
What did he say?

34:57.389 --> 34:59.641
- Nothing, really. It just...

34:59.683 --> 35:00.934
- Just what?

35:00.975 --> 35:03.645
- It's just something
was on his mind. But...

35:05.814 --> 35:07.691
I never found out what.

35:10.527 --> 35:14.572
- So, do you think it...
it could be true?

35:17.409 --> 35:20.245
Cash?
- I... I don't know.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.831
(somber music)

35:29.129 --> 35:30.714
(rain pattering)

35:30.755 --> 35:34.300
- Hi, you two.
How was JB's big BBQ?

35:34.342 --> 35:37.679
- Oh, I think JB
is officially a fan.

35:37.721 --> 35:39.931
Hey, where'd everyone go?

35:39.973 --> 35:42.392
- Well, Nic, Steve
and the rest of the guys,

35:42.434 --> 35:44.769
they went into town
for the evening.

35:44.811 --> 35:48.523
- Uh, well, Cash certainly
was a hit at the barbecue,

35:48.565 --> 35:51.443
but I'm tired, so.
- Oh, come on. Pull up a chair.

35:51.484 --> 35:53.361
- There she is.

35:53.403 --> 35:55.071
- Oh, what did you two
do to him?

35:55.113 --> 35:56.781
- Nothing.
- Not a thing.

35:56.823 --> 35:58.867
- Heard about the rain.
Thought I could lend a hand,

35:58.908 --> 36:00.744
what with you and Cash
off at the party.

36:00.785 --> 36:04.330
- Oh. Well, that's very
gentlemanly of you.

36:04.372 --> 36:07.375
- Did you? Lend a hand?

36:07.417 --> 36:09.252
- Oh, Cash.
- Are you kidding?

36:09.294 --> 36:10.587
Gus saved the day.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.714
- We had to beat the rain
bringing in bales.

36:12.756 --> 36:14.257
Remember that tractor,
Tiny Dancer?

36:14.299 --> 36:15.884
- Yeah, Lord rest her soul.

36:15.925 --> 36:19.179
- Gus got elbow deep and
he brought her back to life.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.597
I've never seen
anything like it.

36:20.638 --> 36:22.349
- It was pure luck.

36:22.390 --> 36:24.351
- Wow, we have a true hero
among us.

36:24.392 --> 36:26.644
Well, I wanna hear more
about this tomorrow,

36:26.686 --> 36:28.271
but I'm gonna head to bed.

36:28.313 --> 36:29.773
- Okay, can I see you
to your truck?

36:29.814 --> 36:33.109
- No. You stay.
I'll call you tomorrow.

36:33.151 --> 36:35.612
- Missy, it's pouring out.

36:35.653 --> 36:38.281
- Hey, Gus, Gus.
She's tired man.

36:38.323 --> 36:40.992
Hey, hey, Gus. Hey! Let her be.

36:41.034 --> 36:44.371
- Cash, if Missy wants him
to go, she'll tell him herself.

36:44.412 --> 36:46.498
- Yeah, she already did.
Uh, just, guess what,

36:46.539 --> 36:48.041
heroes don't hear
so well or what?

36:48.083 --> 36:50.502
- Come on, man. Cool down.
- You just got here.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.379
How I ruffled your feathers
already I don't know,

36:52.420 --> 36:53.755
but I think it's time
for me to leave.

36:53.797 --> 36:55.507
- Now, there's something
we agree on.

36:55.548 --> 36:57.801
- Isabel, Tuff, Valeria,
thanks for an eventful day.

36:57.842 --> 36:59.678
- Gus, you haven't even had
your pie.

36:59.719 --> 37:01.930
- I'm gonna dream about your
coleslaw for months.

37:01.971 --> 37:04.891
- Thank you, Gus.
Thank you for today.

37:08.770 --> 37:12.023
What is going on with you?
That was rude and uncalled for.

37:12.065 --> 37:13.400
- It's been a day, okay?

37:13.441 --> 37:16.152
(groaning)
I'll go talk to him.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.532
(sighing)

37:21.908 --> 37:23.159
- Hey, Gus.

37:24.744 --> 37:26.538
(sighing)

37:28.289 --> 37:30.125
I appreciate you fixing
the tractor,

37:30.166 --> 37:33.962
but you can't fix
everything around here,

37:34.004 --> 37:35.839
you know that, right?
- I can try.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.467
- Why? We were getting along
just fine on our own.

37:39.509 --> 37:41.845
- Yeah, it didn't seem
that way to me.

37:41.886 --> 37:45.140
- You have no idea
what it's like to be us, Gus.

37:45.181 --> 37:47.517
You were handed everything
since the day you were born.

37:47.559 --> 37:49.853
- And that makes me
a threat to you, why?

37:49.894 --> 37:52.313
'Cause I can help your family,
or because for some reason,

37:52.355 --> 37:54.399
you don't like the fact that
Missy and I are getting close?

37:54.441 --> 37:55.775
- Nah, because you don't
deserve her.

37:55.817 --> 37:57.694
- I'll let her decide that.

37:57.736 --> 37:59.821
- I see who you really are.
I don't like ya.

37:59.863 --> 38:01.865
- And I see you
and you are broken.

38:01.906 --> 38:03.616
And I see Missy
holding your hand

38:03.658 --> 38:05.201
through all the bull riding
and the barbecues

38:05.243 --> 38:07.454
because she's got a feeling
for you, and it's pity.

38:07.495 --> 38:08.913
And one day soon,
she's gonna realize

38:08.955 --> 38:10.498
she's getting tired
of being your babysitter.

38:10.540 --> 38:13.251
(grunting)

38:18.423 --> 38:20.717
- Hey, Cash! No!

38:20.759 --> 38:22.552
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

38:22.594 --> 38:24.637
Get out of here. Get out!

38:26.681 --> 38:29.351
- I think this was the best
harvest dinner yet.

38:31.394 --> 38:33.563
- Days like these,

38:33.605 --> 38:38.234
I'm reminded of harvest dinners
with him like it was yesterday.

38:40.278 --> 38:41.905
- I miss Dusty too.

38:41.946 --> 38:43.114
- Yeah.

38:45.283 --> 38:47.243
You and Dusty had this dream

38:47.285 --> 38:51.247
and we had a lot of fun
fantasizing about it.

38:54.250 --> 38:57.045
But for it to work,
we need to find an investor

38:57.087 --> 39:00.298
who believes in the
possibilities like we do.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.301
- What's this, "we" stuff?

39:04.719 --> 39:06.763
- I'm gonna be
your partner, Hank.

39:07.639 --> 39:09.933
(tender music)

39:09.974 --> 39:12.936
- I knew I could
bring you around.

39:12.977 --> 39:16.064
- Look, I would sell my soul
for this ranch.

39:16.106 --> 39:18.608
Even if it means going
into business with you.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.735
(chuckling)

39:20.777 --> 39:22.362
- Well, all right then.

39:24.698 --> 39:26.366
(chuckling)

39:26.408 --> 39:28.785
- I smacked it on the pillar.
- It's gonna bruise.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.870
Can you wiggle your fingers?
- It's fine.

39:30.912 --> 39:33.581
I promised JB
I'd ride next week.

39:33.623 --> 39:35.625
- Okay, well, I'm gonna
get you some ice.

39:35.667 --> 39:38.086
(groaning)
- Ah, it was a good day, Val.

39:38.128 --> 39:41.006
Why'd I go and mess it up?
- Hey, you didn't.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.759
It's just... There's been
a lot going on.

39:44.801 --> 39:47.053
- I'm never gonna be enough.

39:48.013 --> 39:49.681
- For who?

39:50.974 --> 39:52.392
(sighing)

39:52.434 --> 39:54.019
Cash.

39:55.395 --> 39:57.188
When I got back here,

39:57.230 --> 39:59.399
you were the only one
who didn't judge me.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.196
You are more than good enough.

40:07.365 --> 40:08.700
Come here.

40:21.338 --> 40:22.797
(sighing)

40:24.382 --> 40:27.177
(sniffling)

40:36.269 --> 40:38.730
(somber music)

40:45.153 --> 40:47.364
(breathing shakily)

40:47.405 --> 40:48.823
(bull snorting)

40:58.249 --> 41:00.085
- Did you cheat on me?

41:02.045 --> 41:04.756
I would ask him, but I can't,
and you know why?

41:04.798 --> 41:06.841
Because of you.

41:07.592 --> 41:10.095
Because you took him from me.

41:10.136 --> 41:14.516
(sobbing)
You and your stupid sport!

41:16.351 --> 41:19.646
I hate you. I hate you.

41:19.688 --> 41:21.856
And I hate you.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.026
I hate you. And I miss you.

41:26.903 --> 41:28.530
I just want to know why.

41:30.949 --> 41:32.117
Why?

41:34.077 --> 41:35.203
(sniffling)

41:35.245 --> 41:36.913
(tense music)

42:02.731 --> 42:05.483
Subtitling: difuze
