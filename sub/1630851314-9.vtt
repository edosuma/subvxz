WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:04.482
<i>Previously onRoswell, New Mexico...</i>

00:04.526 --> 00:05.701
<i>Patricia and Nora were working
on a machine together,</i>

00:05.744 --> 00:07.050
<i>till they were caught</i>

00:07.094 --> 00:08.791
by some creepy doctor
named Lockhart.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.054
You've been jumping into
clones' bodies to stay alive.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.708
Until your mother's triad

00:12.751 --> 00:14.927
destroyed the science.
I needed to generate more.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.191
If Jones is convinced
that this equation

00:17.234 --> 00:18.496
is the key to his salvation,

00:18.540 --> 00:20.150
then maybe
it's just what we need

00:20.194 --> 00:21.456
to destroy him.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.751
As the lead geneticist
in Los Alamos

00:55.794 --> 00:58.667
for 27 years,
I understood you to be

00:58.710 --> 01:00.930
one of the brightest minds
in your field.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.714
It's not for lack
of trying, Mr. Jones.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.716
I filled in what I could,

01:04.760 --> 01:06.066
but it's beyond me.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.027
It is so troublesome
when the spark...

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
of ingenuity slips away.

01:23.648 --> 01:26.956
It seems we need to find
ourselves a smarter genius,

01:26.999 --> 01:28.566
huh, buddy?

01:37.445 --> 01:40.448
♪ You can run, you can hide...

01:43.494 --> 01:44.974
What's with the tarps, Ortecho?

01:45.017 --> 01:47.759
Yearly fumigating.
Where's Max?

01:47.803 --> 01:49.239
Well, apparently almost dying

01:49.283 --> 01:51.459
and then swapping bodies
with an evil dictator

01:51.502 --> 01:54.070
sort of takes it out of a guy--
he's been asleep for two days.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.637
Tell me you've
at least taken a nap

01:55.680 --> 01:56.855
since removing him from the pod.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.683
After considerable
microscope time,

01:58.727 --> 02:00.685
I have come to a conclusion.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.861
The telomeres in Jones's DNA--

02:02.905 --> 02:05.342
the thing that geneticists use
to measure life expectancy--

02:05.386 --> 02:07.170
are disintegrating
at a rapid rate.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.346
Making Max
Jones's safe haven from death

02:09.390 --> 02:11.653
even more implicit.
But...

02:11.696 --> 02:13.611
if we can swap them
into their rightful bodies

02:13.655 --> 02:15.309
and sever the psychic tether
between them,

02:15.352 --> 02:19.661
we can both save Max
and be free to kill Jones.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.619
Is that something we can do?

02:21.663 --> 02:23.752
Theoretically, yes.

02:23.795 --> 02:24.970
If I could create

02:25.014 --> 02:26.624
a way to fill in
those receptors

02:26.668 --> 02:29.497
once the bond is broken, then
I could essentially seal them

02:29.540 --> 02:31.151
from an attack
from Jones's cells.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.197
I'm gonna take
Alien Complications for 200.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.025
Wouldn't Jones also want
- to sever the connection?
- Yeah.

02:36.068 --> 02:38.245
And I'm certain he is trying
to find a way to fill in

02:38.288 --> 02:40.899
the gaps in the science that he
got a peek of from Theo's mind.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.728
Whoever gets the science first

02:43.772 --> 02:45.948
controls whose body
Max stays in.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.167
Me and Alex are
trying to get

02:47.210 --> 02:48.864
the Lockhart machine
to work properly

02:48.907 --> 02:50.300
so we can retrieve the rest
of Theo's equation.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.433
That would totally give us
the advantage.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.740
And then I'd still have
to just actualize it.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.220
Please tell me this is the part

02:57.264 --> 02:59.091
where that classic
Liz Ortecho moxie kicks in.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.485
If you mean that I illegally hid
a copy of my research in L.A.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.922
from Genoryx before they could
sell it to a skin care company

03:03.966 --> 03:06.273
so that I could get a head start
on mending Max,

03:06.316 --> 03:09.014
then yes, we are squarely
in classic Liz territory.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.103
Alien Complications for 400.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.453
Go.

03:12.496 --> 03:16.021
You still need to invent
the science, don't you?

03:16.065 --> 03:17.240
Yes.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.676
And, um...

03:18.720 --> 03:20.330
I feel my best chance
of doing that

03:20.374 --> 03:23.115
would be with the person that
I broke the initial boundaries

03:23.159 --> 03:26.206
of these theories with--
my former lab partner, Heath.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.512
You're talking about bringing in
the guy you got under

03:28.556 --> 03:30.906
in order to get over Max
in on our secret?

03:30.949 --> 03:32.255
Heath was more
than a booty call.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.952
And because of his
out-of-the-box thinking,

03:33.996 --> 03:35.519
I got Noah's burnt spores,

03:35.563 --> 03:37.782
and they are currently being
cultivated into alien stem cells

03:37.826 --> 03:39.219
as we speak.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.830
Look, considering there's
a clock on Max's life,

03:41.873 --> 03:43.353
I cannot think
of a better person

03:43.397 --> 03:45.442
who would help make
those seconds count.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.618
Okay, I'm gonna close out
the Alien Complications category

03:47.662 --> 03:49.446
and wager that Heath

03:49.490 --> 03:50.926
isn't gonna call
you back,

03:50.969 --> 03:52.319
since he drove you back
here and you told him

03:52.362 --> 03:53.972
to go chase Dr. Holden,
who doesn't exist.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.975
So now you just need
to convince someone

03:57.019 --> 03:58.629
who's not taking your calls

03:58.673 --> 04:01.241
to rejoin Team Liz,
and then convince Max

04:01.284 --> 04:02.894
that his fear
of outsiders and science,

04:02.938 --> 04:05.070
all wrapped up
in what I'm assuming

04:05.114 --> 04:07.029
is a rather handsome
romantic rival,

04:07.072 --> 04:09.118
is the best option on the table.

04:11.294 --> 04:15.864
Hey. Did I sleep through
the plan to save my life?

04:20.521 --> 04:23.263
There seems to be no lasting
effects from the paralytic

04:23.306 --> 04:25.134
you were injected with
outside that cop's home.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.919
But... we're still looking
for clues to identify it

04:27.963 --> 04:30.139
and where your adverse reaction
to it came from.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.184
Physician to physician,
I could be helpful here.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.012
I suggest you have
your team relook

04:34.056 --> 04:36.232
at the endoplasmic reticulum
for traces of the paralytic.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.886
But you're not a physician
in these walls.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.104
You're a patient.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.324
I'll take it from here, Darby.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.546
Thank you.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.548
Clearly, your
stubbornness shows

04:47.591 --> 04:48.766
your strength has returned.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.290
I'm thankful for the care,

04:50.333 --> 04:52.117
but I should really... You want to learn

04:52.161 --> 04:53.554
who attacked you.

04:53.597 --> 04:57.340
Kyle, what you should do
is leave this research to us.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.778
You don't have the expertise to
do this kind of off-book work.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.911
I literally hijacked
an operating room

05:02.954 --> 05:04.913
to bring an alien back to life.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.958
I've stolen bodies,

05:07.002 --> 05:10.440
did an alien autopsy,
had a radio talk back to me.

05:10.484 --> 05:13.661
No one is more qualified in
top secret ET shenanigans

05:13.704 --> 05:15.315
than me.

05:16.185 --> 05:19.188
There is so much of Jim in you.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.930
Then that should
be reason enough

05:21.973 --> 05:23.975
for you to let me
help you pursue this.
No.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.978
I opened this door to my brother
and I got him killed,

05:27.022 --> 05:29.633
and I will not do
the same to you.

05:29.677 --> 05:30.982
Hey.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.375
You don't get to say
something like that

05:32.419 --> 05:33.811
and just walk away.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.379
You better add a little context
to that sentence.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.694
- You're here.
- I'm here.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.875
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about the clues

05:53.918 --> 05:55.485
we found out in the mindscape.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.662
- Excuse me.
- Can we maybe think about them
after breakfast?

05:58.706 --> 06:01.448
Yes. Beeblebrox burritos.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.101
Maria and I haven't had a chance

06:03.145 --> 06:05.974
to talk about what she saw
- in Patricia's memories.
- Well,

06:06.017 --> 06:07.889
amidst a eugenics nightmare,
we discovered

06:07.932 --> 06:10.108
that her grandmother
and Michael's mom

06:10.152 --> 06:11.371
were secretly building a machine

06:11.414 --> 06:12.850
to contact an alien
here in Roswell.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.374
Okay, but where is
this alien hiding?

06:14.417 --> 06:16.288
Between Tripp's journal
and a chat with Alex,

06:16.332 --> 06:18.160
they all made it
into the prison.

06:18.203 --> 06:20.075
Well, clearly not all.
There were you three,

06:20.118 --> 06:22.425
Noah. Maybe some
are still in a pod?

06:22.469 --> 06:24.514
Or, like myself--
and I can't believe

06:24.558 --> 06:26.995
that I'm about to say this--
they hatched.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.258
In which case,
they would come out kind of...

06:29.301 --> 06:31.216
Speechless,
- confused, lost.
- Yeah.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.001
When police find
my mom wandering,

06:33.044 --> 06:34.655
they first file
a police report...

06:34.698 --> 06:37.875
Which is why I brought Max's
computer and sheriff's codes.

06:37.919 --> 06:40.312
All we have to do
is search police records

06:40.356 --> 06:42.402
for a case that matches
that description,

06:42.445 --> 06:44.534
compile a suspect list,
and then investigate from there.

06:44.578 --> 06:48.016
Yeah, but that could be a
huge list spanning decades.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.758
Hence the "butter-me-up"
burritos.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.895
Hello?

06:57.939 --> 06:59.244
How's the office, honey?

06:59.288 --> 07:01.421
I'm a little distracted
with these dials.

07:01.464 --> 07:04.206
Working theory is a take on the
Vigenère cipher with a twist.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.642
Mm.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.252
Well, you know I love it
when you talk code-y to me.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.254
I'm calling because I want
to make sure that you're

07:09.298 --> 07:10.734
being careful
with the brain melter.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.910
Yes. And I'm eating my Wheaties.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.390
Yeah, Manes, not funny.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.088
Look, first day back,
Eduardo did a full workup

07:17.132 --> 07:19.569
before and after handling
the device.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.266
Although we don't know why,

07:21.310 --> 07:23.921
the machine seems to boost
dopamine levels, which produces

07:23.965 --> 07:26.750
hallucinations and auditory misnomers,

07:26.794 --> 07:28.535
which I posit
is why that anybody

07:28.578 --> 07:29.840
who's working closely with it

07:29.884 --> 07:31.929
feels like the machine's
talking to them.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.628
So I'm working on it
in 15-minute increments

07:34.671 --> 07:36.847
- every six hours.
- Promise me
you won't take extra credit

07:36.891 --> 07:38.153
with the alien phone.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.763
'Cause I know
you've been working late.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.852
I dropped off the Crashdown's
new grilled Hamdalorian

07:41.896 --> 07:44.507
and cheese sammies;
respectfully left it

07:44.551 --> 07:46.988
inside the door so the coyotes
wouldn't snag 'em.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.859
Thank you very much, Guerin.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.471
All right, okay, okay, okay.
I actually called

07:51.514 --> 07:53.255
because I'm working
with the turquoise

07:53.298 --> 07:54.778
and oscillating currents
flowing through it.

07:54.822 --> 07:58.956
I think I have a theory
on how the machine is sealed

07:59.000 --> 08:00.218
and how maybe alien tech
and frequency

08:00.262 --> 08:01.481
could open it
so we could fix it.

08:01.524 --> 08:04.614
Well, that's our show, kids.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.094
End of my safety window.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.879
Yeah. Okay, have fun,
don't lose track of time.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.534
I am not going to forget
our very first real,

08:11.578 --> 08:12.970
in-public date.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.668
I promise.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.321
Goodbye.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.003
If you're seeing me,
you must be close

08:46.047 --> 08:48.528
to understanding
the machine I built.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.966
So what's another 15 minutes
gonna hurt

08:52.009 --> 08:53.402
to find out if you're right?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.192
How long do you think this
is gonna take? You know...

09:01.236 --> 09:02.367
I got to save your life.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.195
I get the feeling you're mocking

09:04.239 --> 09:05.675
my old-school sense of chivalry.

09:05.719 --> 09:08.591
No, I was... I was thinking
about when I was planning

09:08.635 --> 09:11.376
a road trip senior year, and you
first invited yourself along

09:11.420 --> 09:13.770
with the promise
of changing all the tires.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.816
13 years later, here we are.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.339
I believe the goal

09:17.382 --> 09:19.646
was... ocean,

09:19.689 --> 09:21.212
not alien spores

09:21.256 --> 09:22.736
- and DNA research.
- Well,

09:22.779 --> 09:24.738
you know,
if I'd had more time,

09:24.781 --> 09:26.566
I would have grabbed
the mix I made back then.

09:26.609 --> 09:31.396
I bet backwards-baseball-cap
you had a song for everything.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.963
State lines,

09:33.007 --> 09:35.270
sunsets...

09:36.706 --> 09:39.927
Did you have
a "make your move on me" track?

09:40.754 --> 09:42.059
You did.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.278
Ho-ho-ho!

09:43.321 --> 09:45.410
That's very smooth.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.065
All right,
what was the opening track?

09:48.109 --> 09:50.981
Fastball, "The Way."

09:51.025 --> 09:53.549
That's very bold.
Respect.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.162
All right,

09:58.206 --> 10:00.382
I'll crank up this song.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.993
You get us back
on the road.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.761
♪ Heavy loads

10:31.805 --> 10:34.416
♪ Dirty roads
and a lot of pain ♪

10:34.459 --> 10:36.070
♪ Takes a toll on your soul

10:37.201 --> 10:38.855
♪ Make you go insane

10:40.422 --> 10:42.032
♪ I think I'd
better make a change... ♪

10:45.296 --> 10:46.689
Yes?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.430
You know, given that we
are trying to catch a killer,

10:48.473 --> 10:50.519
save my brother
and potentially a planet,

10:50.562 --> 10:52.216
I was hoping
for a little less flirting

10:52.260 --> 10:53.696
and a little more filing.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.524
Your singular focus
really worries me.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.308
Okay, look, I get that,
uh, cheating death

10:57.352 --> 10:58.658
made you want
to embrace life.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.529
It's just that, uh,
maybe we could push it

11:00.572 --> 11:03.140
until after we have beaten
Jones to the science.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.882
Besides, it's not like
some hot opportunity

11:05.926 --> 11:08.624
is gonna walk through that door
and ask me out on a date.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.975
Oh,

11:12.019 --> 11:14.325
look who just walked
through the door--

11:14.369 --> 11:15.805
it's the woman I saw
you canoodling with

11:15.849 --> 11:19.026
when we took down Jordan
Bernhardt in this very bar.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.637
Hey.
Hey.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.683
I'm doing a story on
the recent murders.

11:23.726 --> 11:27.077
Sussing out if the crime at
Max's that put you in a coma

11:27.121 --> 11:28.513
and the church
fire are connected

11:28.557 --> 11:30.124
to the Roswell
Regiment attacks.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.603
- Interesting.
- Hmm.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.388
Isobel would like to do
an interview.
Mm.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.565
Uh, normally, yes,
uh, I would,

11:36.608 --> 11:38.915
but it's just right now
is not a great time for...

11:38.959 --> 11:40.482
Deep Throat.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.703
Because my throat is busy.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.182
Talking, I mean.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.358
Why don't I just let you know
if I think of anything?

11:47.402 --> 11:49.230
But thank you
for stopping by.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.015
Maybe...

11:52.059 --> 11:54.757
we can grab
drinks together?

11:55.889 --> 11:57.586
Oh.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.897
So why would you shut

12:03.940 --> 12:05.463
that beautiful, soulful

12:05.507 --> 12:08.684
"maybe we could grab drinks
together" woman down?

12:08.728 --> 12:13.036
Uh, beyond the fact that she
investigates lies for a living

12:13.080 --> 12:14.908
and I literally live one?

12:14.951 --> 12:16.431
For what it's worth,

12:16.474 --> 12:17.911
she did come in here

12:17.954 --> 12:19.477
asking about you
the other night, Iz.

12:19.521 --> 12:20.914
Okay.

12:20.957 --> 12:25.396
Anatsa and I may have had
a few cocktails, and then...

12:25.440 --> 12:27.311
a proposition might have been...

12:27.355 --> 12:28.748
propositioned.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.097
And then it is possible

12:30.140 --> 12:32.229
that I chickened out
and mindscaped a naval officer

12:32.273 --> 12:34.275
to steal his waiting Lyft.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.798
You bourbon'd and bolted?

12:35.842 --> 12:37.321
Sipped and snuck?

12:37.365 --> 12:39.106
Highballed it
and hightailed it.

12:39.149 --> 12:43.066
Okay, you're both very clever,
but dating is on hold right now.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.242
We need to focus
on preventing more murders,

12:45.286 --> 12:46.853
including our own.

12:47.723 --> 12:51.466
"Child who couldn't speak."

12:52.467 --> 12:54.730
The name's
redacted, but...

12:54.774 --> 12:56.819
he was found drowning
in Mesa Pines Lake.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.343
They assumed his parents
drowned as well, but the bodies

12:59.387 --> 13:01.258
- were never discovered.
- Look at that date.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.651
That's the day
Louise died.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.479
Meaning that's the day
your pods opened up.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.917
Same day, same afflictions
as Max, Michael and I.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.180
It's worth a look.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.617
If I have activated some sort
of holographic interface,

13:12.661 --> 13:14.924
maybe a little guidance
would be good.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.404
I mean, do I start on the dials?

13:16.447 --> 13:17.840
Do I move to the internal tech?

13:17.884 --> 13:19.624
Perhaps your failure
is because you're not meant

13:19.668 --> 13:21.757
to touch things
from another world.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.153
Wow.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.852
Oh, you aren't a talking
memory from a machine,

13:29.896 --> 13:31.332
you're a manifestation
of my own mind.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.421
Took you long enough
to get there.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.989
All right, well, when
my own hallucination

13:36.032 --> 13:37.120
starts to insult me,

13:37.164 --> 13:38.382
I think it's
time to step away

13:38.426 --> 13:39.993
from the dangerous
alien machine.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.472
Fair enough.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.126
Let me ask you this.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.476
Why did you hold back intel
from Michael about the machine?

13:45.520 --> 13:49.524
I didn't. I-I told him it
incited a neurological response.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.308
But you left out that others
have found themselves

13:51.352 --> 13:53.310
so deeply tangled in
their own manifestations

13:53.354 --> 13:54.790
that harm came to them.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.400
One walked into the
Rio Grande. Drowned.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.967
Another stepped
into traffic.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.143
What will this machine do
to make you lose your way?

14:00.187 --> 14:02.537
I won't...

14:04.104 --> 14:05.888
I won't lose my way.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.934
Michael is my focus,
and remembering that

14:07.977 --> 14:09.631
will keep me from any undoing.

14:09.674 --> 14:13.113
I'd argue that your feelings
for him will be your undoing.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.897
You could have
conjured anyone,

14:14.941 --> 14:16.681
Airman-- you chose me.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.422
I think it's because
I represent the pain

14:18.466 --> 14:21.861
that has always existed
between our two families.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.385
Or maybe I
just represent

14:24.428 --> 14:26.039
who you really think
you're fighting with

14:26.082 --> 14:27.649
when it comes to this device.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.046
Well, they're no Shatner Shakes,

14:33.089 --> 14:34.612
but these were on our list
of road trip stops.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.918
Bathroom breakin'anyway--

14:35.962 --> 14:38.225
- figured what's the harm.
- Okay, we got to pause

14:38.268 --> 14:39.704
on the cathartic
high school wistfulness.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.402
We are on a cannonball run
to get some spores

14:41.445 --> 14:43.273
to make some science
that might save a planet

14:43.317 --> 14:45.188
from a megalomaniac ruler,
but at the very least

14:45.232 --> 14:46.711
- it'll save you.
- Right.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.278
I am trying to embrace that.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.281
Hey, I made that, um,
mixed tape back in high school,

14:51.325 --> 14:55.024
to slip into all the discussions
I wanted to have with you.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.330
But we're not kids anymore,

14:56.373 --> 14:58.898
so I just got to say
the hard things

14:58.941 --> 15:01.422
and let the chips fall
where they may.

15:01.465 --> 15:04.164
What are you trying to say?

15:04.207 --> 15:06.383
You know I burned down your lab,

15:06.427 --> 15:08.211
but before I did...

15:08.255 --> 15:09.909
I saved your tapes.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.389
You kept my tapes?

15:12.433 --> 15:14.957
Yeah. And I knew
how much they meant to you,

15:15.001 --> 15:17.568
and that they
were irreplaceable, so...

15:17.612 --> 15:19.788
I buried them outside my house.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.225
You let me believe
- that they were lost forever?
- Right.

15:22.269 --> 15:25.359
And I always intended for them
to go back to you after I died.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.361
But I...

15:27.404 --> 15:28.753
I was a coward back then.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.712
I want to do what
you're doing,

15:30.755 --> 15:33.323
walk forward and not back.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.545
So what now?

15:38.633 --> 15:41.810
Now it's my turn to drive.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.990
Maybe it's because
I just came out of a coma,

15:48.034 --> 15:49.949
but you got to appreciate
the majesty of nature.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.602
You know,
unless the "majesty of nature"

15:51.646 --> 15:53.343
is also committing murders,

15:53.387 --> 15:54.954
I think we have
bigger fish to fry.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.086
Listen, Jones mentioned
that the ship was breaking apart

15:57.130 --> 15:59.306
as it was plummeting
towards the Earth.

15:59.349 --> 16:00.785
Our dad instilled in us

16:00.829 --> 16:02.570
the altitude trajectory
and flight coordinates

16:02.613 --> 16:03.788
of the '47 shipwreck.

16:03.832 --> 16:04.964
Well, this camp

16:05.007 --> 16:06.008
was right on the path,

16:06.052 --> 16:07.357
so you could be
onto something.

16:07.401 --> 16:08.880
Well, before we
commit a felony,

16:08.924 --> 16:10.839
I just want a little
more proof that

16:10.882 --> 16:12.275
this is where
we should be hunting

16:12.319 --> 16:13.624
for our little green man.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.496
Yeah, and short of finding
a little green man,

16:15.539 --> 16:17.324
I mean, how are we
gonna get that?

16:35.429 --> 16:36.473
Watsons...

16:36.517 --> 16:38.040
it's time to Sherlock ourselves

16:38.084 --> 16:40.086
the whereabouts of an alien.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.745
You know whatthis is?

16:47.789 --> 16:50.313
It's a shelter
for undocumented.

16:50.357 --> 16:53.577
Your father and I
used to hide out here.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.057
Away from Manes.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.104
Have a drink...

16:58.147 --> 17:00.541
or six.

17:01.542 --> 17:05.067
This is distilled
in a small town

17:05.111 --> 17:07.069
where our family
is from.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.157
Careyes.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.551
These lines mark
important dates

17:10.594 --> 17:12.683
in mine and Jim's lives.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.034
The day Jim got engaged.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.081
The day Rosa was born.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.517
Uh...

17:20.561 --> 17:22.563
day I became the head
of Deep Sky.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.347
Yeah, I appreciate
the nostalgia,

17:24.391 --> 17:27.524
but what did you mean when
you said you killed my father?

17:30.571 --> 17:32.138
Whereas I "died"

17:32.181 --> 17:35.184
and the Deep Sky version
of me was born,

17:35.228 --> 17:36.838
your father,

17:36.881 --> 17:40.059
well, he chose to die a little
every day.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.279
He was a double agent
at Caulfield.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.759
All the while

17:44.802 --> 17:47.066
clandestinely passing
information to Deep Sky

17:47.109 --> 17:49.068
in the hopes
of undermining Jesse Manes

17:49.111 --> 17:50.417
and Project Shepherd.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.201
Till Manes got revenge
and threw him in a cell

17:52.245 --> 17:53.637
with a broken alien.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.117
It was in retaliation

17:55.161 --> 17:58.120
for Jim getting me
the Lockhart machine.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.688
You can't blame yourself for
everything Jesse Manes did.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.777
Your father became obsessed

18:02.820 --> 18:05.084
in his mission
to help the aliens.

18:05.127 --> 18:09.349
But in his singular focus,
his personal life unraveled.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.960
He developed
what he called "the code."

18:13.657 --> 18:15.616
Altruistic in its conception,

18:15.659 --> 18:18.140
it became something
he hid behind

18:18.184 --> 18:21.143
to justify his actions.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.973
Alex has told me

18:25.016 --> 18:29.673
that you live your life
following that same code.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.806
I am here to tell you
that you are chasing

18:31.849 --> 18:35.331
the shadow of a man
who was beyond fallible.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.855
That is the last line
of this bottle.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.944
A promise that I made Jim
that I would keep you away

18:39.988 --> 18:43.774
from this life and all of the
consequences that come with it.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.125
<i>Can't crack this girl open</i>

18:46.168 --> 18:47.604
any further, huh?

18:47.648 --> 18:48.910
You ready to admit

18:48.953 --> 18:50.607
what you really think
the problem is yet?

18:50.651 --> 18:52.435
We could take
this machine to Michael.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.437
He's an alien.
It's an alien machine.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.917
Why not do what seems obvious?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.919
Because I would never
let Guerin get hurt

18:57.962 --> 18:59.225
by something that you built.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.922
He put you on a
pedestal, and I doubt

19:00.965 --> 19:02.532
that he wants to be
held by the guy

19:02.576 --> 19:03.925
who takes you off of it.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.057
How about you trade
the alien tech for the path

19:06.101 --> 19:08.799
you've had some success with
last week?

19:09.670 --> 19:10.975
Using your internal camera

19:11.019 --> 19:13.282
to see what makes
the machine tick

19:13.326 --> 19:14.327
or not tick.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.683
What's that, Airman?

19:22.726 --> 19:24.728
Looks like you
finally found proof

19:24.772 --> 19:27.644
of what you haven't been willing
to admit this whole time.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.037
You and Michael,

19:29.080 --> 19:32.171
you're still caught
in your father's shadow.

19:36.523 --> 19:37.872
Please tell me that,

19:37.915 --> 19:39.178
between the
googly eyes

19:39.221 --> 19:40.483
you're giving my
great-great-grandniece,

19:40.527 --> 19:42.137
that you have
found something.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.487
I found some info that would add
context to the police report.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.662
Oh, thank God.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.490
Uh, social services
was overwhelmed,

19:47.534 --> 19:49.013
so the Christian camp owners
volunteered

19:49.057 --> 19:50.580
to keep him here
for the summer.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.583
They kept this journal...

19:53.627 --> 19:55.063
to check on his progress.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.891
They called him
Johnny Doe.
Right. Of course.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.936
Because why give him a name
that we could actually track

19:58.980 --> 20:00.764
when they could just give him
something cutesy?

20:00.808 --> 20:02.201
Well, the kid
didn't talk for a week,

20:02.244 --> 20:04.594
and then, all of a sudden,
he spoke as if he learned

20:04.638 --> 20:06.292
the entire language.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.858
And those photos,
I found in the office.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.686
Yeah, if-if you
look at them,

20:09.730 --> 20:11.688
apparently Johnny Doe came
to this camp every summer.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.821
There's a photo in there
of a friend.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.518
And there's
some more photos I found

20:15.562 --> 20:16.824
of the two of them playing

20:16.867 --> 20:18.304
in a cabin
that we were searching.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.522
Does said friend have a name?

20:19.566 --> 20:21.132
Nickname. Buckskin.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.874
It's a big camp.
We're gonna keep on searching.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.746
It's a ma-and-pa place,
so they didn't exactly

20:25.789 --> 20:27.008
keep a lot of records.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.270
Yeah.
All right, well,

20:28.314 --> 20:29.837
if we're all-nightering it,
I'm gonna make

20:29.880 --> 20:31.882
some old-fashioneds
from that bottle of bourbon

20:31.926 --> 20:33.928
I found
- in the confiscated box.
- Mm.

20:33.971 --> 20:34.842
Okay.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.060
I'm gonna go upstairs,

20:36.104 --> 20:37.366
see if I can find any clues

20:37.410 --> 20:38.498
in the rooms.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.542
Why don't you take a break?

20:39.586 --> 20:41.109
Maybe it'll add

20:41.152 --> 20:42.589
some perspective.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.373
I don't have time

20:44.417 --> 20:45.505
for perspective.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.376
I am not going to let Jones win.

20:47.420 --> 20:50.336
I'm not going to let
an evil alien dickwad

20:50.379 --> 20:52.033
take anything else from us.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.730
This evil alien dickwad

20:53.774 --> 20:56.080
is taking something from me
right now.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.604
This is a battle,
not a war,

20:57.647 --> 20:59.040
and we're not gonna make it
to the end of this

20:59.083 --> 21:00.737
if we don't remember
what we're fighting for.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.740
I am fighting
for the people I love.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.655
What do you want for yourself?

21:05.699 --> 21:08.615
Or have you been
in survival mode for so long

21:08.658 --> 21:10.269
that you don't even know
what that is?

21:15.578 --> 21:17.580
Taking mine to go, Manes.

21:23.107 --> 21:26.197
This isn't a violation of trust.

21:27.547 --> 21:30.898
I'm breaking and entering
out of concern for you.

21:39.472 --> 21:42.257
Is Iz okay?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.867
- Yeah.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.913
You know, I always
wanted a sister,

21:45.956 --> 21:48.307
and... I got one.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.136
We had a little...
sister fight.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.964
But... Mm.

21:54.008 --> 21:58.186
Thing is, it's kind of nice
to have a sister fight.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.842
It's nice
to have s'mores.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.627
Live.

22:05.498 --> 22:07.935
That's... that's what I see
when I look back

22:07.978 --> 22:09.632
into my family's memories.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.242
They found that.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.898
I don't know.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.423
Maybe I'm a little tipsy.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.382
I'm just...

22:20.426 --> 22:23.951
really, really glad
I'm not dead.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.693
I'm really glad
you're not dead, too.

Is that
your research?

23:10.345 --> 23:11.302
Not quite.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.697
His name's Enrique.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.438
My dad sends me one

23:16.482 --> 23:19.093
everywhere I go.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.227
Uh...

23:23.271 --> 23:25.752
so, were you...
were you happy here?

23:28.494 --> 23:30.713
L.A. was a commercial
for a life.

23:30.757 --> 23:31.932
The house,

23:31.975 --> 23:33.368
the view...

23:33.412 --> 23:34.587
The boyfriend?

23:34.630 --> 23:39.243
Heath was a commercial,
too, yeah, for...

23:39.287 --> 23:41.028
Getting over me.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.466
My reasons for leaving Roswell,

23:44.510 --> 23:46.337
they were complicated,

23:46.381 --> 23:48.905
but the
science wasn't.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.646
Heath showed me that.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.953
He helped me grow,

23:52.996 --> 23:55.172
professionally and personally.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.568
Okay...

23:59.612 --> 24:02.832
Genoryx took everything
with a scrap of science on it.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.355
But luckily,

24:04.399 --> 24:06.227
I have learned a thing or two
from Rosa

24:06.270 --> 24:09.099
about squirreling science away
for a rainy day.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.417
What's wrong?

24:22.461 --> 24:23.462
My research,

24:23.505 --> 24:24.985
all of it-- it's gone.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.383
Do you think Genoryx
could have gotten that, too?

24:32.427 --> 24:34.168
No, Heath.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.170
He-he must have grabbed it
for me.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.345
B-Before it could
be discovered.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.912
He knew about this hiding spot.

24:38.955 --> 24:43.220
Well, let's hope, uh,
Heath is as good a guy

24:43.264 --> 24:44.657
as you make him out to be.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.006
Call him again.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.573
Explain that we're
in L.A. and...

24:47.616 --> 24:49.009
I've been explaining.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.532
He's not answering.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.751
So we got to
up our game.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.187
I got to make my case in person.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.406
We're going
to his house.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.148
Sit.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.889
Let's have a drink.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.413
And do what, get
me to draw a line

25:02.457 --> 25:05.112
on the family bottle
like it's some contract

25:05.155 --> 25:07.984
I'll leave this
alien stuff be?

25:08.028 --> 25:09.943
How many more mistakes
do I need to recount

25:09.986 --> 25:11.510
that your father made
in his life

25:11.553 --> 25:14.338
to get you to see that that is
exactly what you should do?

25:14.382 --> 25:17.472
When I learned my father was
part of this alien thing,

25:17.516 --> 25:19.692
I thought it was a way
to somehow make him proud

25:19.735 --> 25:20.910
from beyond the grave.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.217
You see, but I've
realized that...

25:23.260 --> 25:25.654
I don't want a part of this
for my dad.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.656
Or relatives that I've never met

25:27.700 --> 25:31.442
and their feuds with Manes men
that I never knew existed.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.664
I want to do this
because this could be part of...

25:35.708 --> 25:36.883
<i>my</i> story.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.407
So thank you...

25:39.450 --> 25:42.192
for showing me that
my dad was flawed enough

25:42.236 --> 25:44.368
that I could step out
of his shadow.

25:44.412 --> 25:47.589
I understand why you want me
to make different choices,

25:47.633 --> 25:49.330
so I am.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.115
I choose to walk the same path,

25:52.159 --> 25:53.987
but better than him.

25:54.030 --> 25:57.164
Now, I don't want
one of your...

25:57.207 --> 25:59.383
cool decoder rings.

25:59.427 --> 26:02.212
But I do want to save
lives as a doctor.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.345
I want a part of this story
that I started with Alex,

26:04.388 --> 26:08.436
and I want a shot at doing it
free from the ghosts.

26:10.612 --> 26:14.355
I can promise you I won't
live in the past, <i>Tío.</i>

26:16.270 --> 26:18.098
And you shouldn't, either.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.368
Yes, hi. This is Deputy Evans.

26:27.411 --> 26:30.589
I need a cell trace on a POI.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.722
<i>What is the matter?</i>

26:33.766 --> 26:35.376
I'm a cop, Liz.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.421
Breaking and entering
isn't really my thing.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.467
You are also an alien,
here to grab some spores

26:39.510 --> 26:41.730
that turn into stem cells
so that we could take down

26:41.774 --> 26:44.733
your planet-enslaving
doppelgaänger.

26:44.777 --> 26:47.214
Ooh, ooh, this is interesting.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.172
Heath left Genoryx

26:49.216 --> 26:51.348
two days after I did.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.741
Must have realized
he didn't need

26:52.785 --> 26:54.221
to be working underneath
their corporate thumb.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.615
How much do you know
about this guy, Heath?

26:56.658 --> 26:58.094
How close were you?

26:58.138 --> 27:00.488
This isn't the time to be
jealous about a boy I met.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.968
I'm just saying it's possible
that he took

27:02.011 --> 27:04.535
your one-of-a-kind
alien spores and quit,

27:04.579 --> 27:05.972
so that, just like you,
he could use

27:06.015 --> 27:07.364
the research himself,
free of Genoryx.

27:07.408 --> 27:08.975
That grand trust speech

27:09.018 --> 27:10.803
certainly had
a short shelf life.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.239
I trust you.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.285
Okay? But I don't trust some guy
I have barely met

27:15.329 --> 27:17.113
with a secret that
could endanger me,

27:17.157 --> 27:18.637
could endanger my family

27:18.680 --> 27:20.421
and break the frickin' Internet
if it came out.

27:20.464 --> 27:23.946
You think
- I would let myself be conned?
- No, I think

27:23.990 --> 27:25.905
you came out here looking
for a partner,

27:25.948 --> 27:27.210
and it could blind you.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.517
Just because you sabotaged me

27:29.560 --> 27:31.127
when I thought
you were mine

27:31.171 --> 27:33.303
does not mean that Heath
would take the same path.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.783
And just because
you changed the wallpaper

27:34.827 --> 27:36.698
doesn't mean
you've mended your blind spots.

27:38.352 --> 27:41.094
I have learned my lessons,
but you...

27:41.137 --> 27:42.835
oh, my God, you
sound an awful lot

27:42.878 --> 27:45.011
like the guy who blew up my lab.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.317
So forgive me, but you're
making it perfectly clear

27:47.361 --> 27:49.319
why I felt like I had to go

27:49.363 --> 27:50.407
and change the wallpaper.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.631
Did you hear that?

28:05.161 --> 28:07.207
Must have been the
electronic lock.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.731
Manual's
still intact.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.091
Those your spores?

28:22.135 --> 28:24.180
It's what held them.

28:24.224 --> 28:26.356
They're gone.

28:42.416 --> 28:45.375
I was hoping we could skip
the awkward staring and...

28:45.419 --> 28:47.377
get to the part
where we help Alex.

28:47.421 --> 28:49.379
Let's not forget you violated
several government laws

28:49.423 --> 28:51.773
and legally, you could
- never see the sun again.
- Hmm.

28:51.817 --> 28:54.950
Let's not forget that you
don't exactly have a doorbell.

28:54.994 --> 28:56.256
And I went
to Alex's house

28:56.299 --> 28:57.779
and found out
that he hasn't been there

28:57.823 --> 28:59.085
for two days.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.696
Alex locked away the machine

29:01.740 --> 29:03.742
two days ago.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.440
- He logged out of the office.
- Yes.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.224
You're all trust-fall
with each other. I know.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.573
But considering
he's one of the best hackers

29:09.617 --> 29:11.140
in the world,
maybe he broke protocol

29:11.184 --> 29:13.708
to work on the machine
that has a built-in siren song.

29:16.711 --> 29:19.845
Run a diagnostic on
the security cams in sector two.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.411
Thanks.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.154
Oh, no. He hacked the cameras
and took the machine.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.721
Are you telling me Alex

29:26.765 --> 29:29.724
has been exposed to the machine
for two days straight?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.292
We need to find him.

29:33.597 --> 29:36.775
Okay, fine.
You were right.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.516
I do have to get control
over my life.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.736
I need to figure out
what it is I'm fighting for

29:41.780 --> 29:43.346
when all of this
is said and done.

29:43.390 --> 29:44.652
But the problem is,

29:44.695 --> 29:46.915
I have no idea
where to even start.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.048
Okay, well...

29:49.091 --> 29:51.137
how do you like your eggs?

29:51.180 --> 29:52.747
What?

29:52.791 --> 29:57.491
I like mine fried,
a little bit runny, Tabasco...

29:57.534 --> 30:01.800
I don't know. Growing up, my mom
didn't eat breakfast, so...

30:01.843 --> 30:03.236
neither could I.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.673
Um, and then with Noah,

30:05.716 --> 30:07.457
yeah, I basically had
whatever he was having,

30:07.501 --> 30:09.851
because, you see,
I am a facsimile of a human...

30:09.895 --> 30:10.983
Okay.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.636
Just start with eggs.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.551
Don't stop
until you know who you are.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.249
Mm?

30:16.292 --> 30:19.252
Speaking of the most
important meal of the day,

30:19.295 --> 30:21.297
how'd you take
your Gregory Manes?

30:21.341 --> 30:24.126
Too early before coffee.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.475
Over hard.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.608
Oh, my God.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.958
Okay, well, do you want to trade

30:30.002 --> 30:30.959
life tips for sex tips?

30:31.003 --> 30:32.352
How flexible is your core?

30:32.395 --> 30:34.049
'Cause that makes
- a big difference.
- Okay,

30:34.093 --> 30:35.355
without bourbon to add to said
coffee, definitely too early.

30:35.398 --> 30:36.878
Christian camp.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.184
Well, at least

30:38.227 --> 30:41.013
let me help lift
the burden of your sin.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.798
Maria, look.

30:46.366 --> 30:49.499
"With love

30:49.543 --> 30:52.198
and the Lincoln
Neighborhood Church."

30:52.241 --> 30:56.332
Oh, it looks like just living
life revealed some clues, hmm?

30:56.376 --> 30:58.378
Very righteous of you.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.162
Ah.

31:00.206 --> 31:02.643
- Mm-hmm.
- I will go, um,

31:02.686 --> 31:04.819
investigate -this cross clue.
- Mm.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.300
You live a little more life
on top of that hardboiled Greg.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.346
Taking mine to go, Manes.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.091
Is that your stuff?

31:16.135 --> 31:18.833
No, these are brain scans.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.878
They're of a person

31:19.921 --> 31:22.141
suffering from neurodegeneration.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.186
Heath said his mom
has Alzheimer's,

31:24.230 --> 31:25.709
but that's not
what this is.

31:25.753 --> 31:28.451
This is a scan
of a much younger person.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.323
Hmm. So he lied to you.

31:30.366 --> 31:33.282
One scan is hardly
a grand conspiracy.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.197
I'm gonna see
if I can...
Shh, shh.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.764
Someone's coming.
We got to go.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.945
- Can't remember the frequency
you hit to crack this open, huh?

31:43.989 --> 31:45.338
Confusion of numbers

31:45.381 --> 31:47.601
is a sign of exhaustion

31:47.644 --> 31:49.298
and deplete
mental fa...
Enough!

31:49.342 --> 31:51.387
I am going to get
my father out of it,

31:51.431 --> 31:53.912
just like everything else
he's ever tried to infect.

31:53.955 --> 31:56.697
Deep down you know there
will always be some machine,

31:56.740 --> 31:58.264
some file

31:58.307 --> 32:00.788
keeping the two
of you apart.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.967
This machine
reminds you...

32:06.011 --> 32:07.099
you're incomplete.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.535
I mean,

32:08.578 --> 32:11.233
that's why you joined
Deep Sky, isn't it?

32:11.277 --> 32:13.540
To fill the void

32:13.583 --> 32:15.759
that your father made in you?

32:15.803 --> 32:18.762
I spent a year cleaning up
my father's messes.

32:18.806 --> 32:22.070
And I made sure that
not one of them touched Michael.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.122
You fear this one's different.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.517
I won't be bested
by some ET ham radio.

32:34.561 --> 32:38.478
Should we talk about
this being a metaphor?

32:38.521 --> 32:40.349
We've done too much talking.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.482
But not enough listening.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.746
Two days ago, you
might have known

32:45.789 --> 32:48.444
what was real and
what was imagined.

32:48.488 --> 32:50.533
And I can imagine
that it would be really hard

32:50.577 --> 32:52.535
to know what-what step

32:52.579 --> 32:54.059
leads to solid ground
and which one leads

32:54.102 --> 32:55.625
to your death.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.715
So I guess you're
left with two truths.

32:58.759 --> 33:01.153
Love makes you
do crazy things!

33:02.502 --> 33:03.720
And worse,

33:03.764 --> 33:08.073
your greatest fear
has been actualized.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.248
Your father's hatred

33:09.291 --> 33:11.293
is stronger

33:11.337 --> 33:13.817
than your capacityto love.

33:18.213 --> 33:21.825
Alex! I got you! I got you.

33:26.656 --> 33:29.007
I always got you.

33:37.667 --> 33:40.366
Mm. Those shoes sure
don't say Sunday morning.

33:42.716 --> 33:43.673
What are you doing here?

33:43.717 --> 33:46.285
This little trinket

33:46.328 --> 33:47.982
was found by Roswell FD.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.898
Their probie hadn't turned it in
to the PD for evidence yet.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.030
What is it?

33:52.073 --> 33:54.032
Unity Church's version
of a crucifix.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.034
On the back,
it had some initials on it.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.383
It looks like...

33:57.426 --> 33:59.385
a "J,"

33:59.428 --> 34:02.562
an "O" or... a "D."

34:03.563 --> 34:05.956
"JD."

34:06.000 --> 34:09.438
Okay, sadly, my snooping
featured fewer firemen,

34:09.482 --> 34:12.702
but I did find a lead with
someone who had those initials.

34:12.746 --> 34:13.834
Hmm.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.924
Good thing about snooping
in a church,

34:16.967 --> 34:19.927
sinners can walk
right through the front door.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.194
I'm so sorry. I...

34:26.238 --> 34:28.240
I wanted to fix this for you.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.677
I j-- I just wanted
to clear it up so that... Yeah.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.766
We could live a normal
"picket fence" life.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.638
Any way you
slice it, Manes,

34:35.682 --> 34:39.077
our picket-fenced yard
is gonna hold aliens.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.079
I guess I just,
I couldn't get the fear

34:41.122 --> 34:44.647
of the rocky path we have
ahead of us out of my mind.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.258
I spoke to Sanders
about the same thing.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.737
He said,

34:47.781 --> 34:49.609
"You don't walk away
from a broken engine.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.394
You find a way to
make it purr again."

34:52.438 --> 34:54.048
Mm.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.486
Hey, um,

34:57.530 --> 34:59.749
I'm not sure,
just because of, you know,

34:59.793 --> 35:01.882
the mass hallucinations,
but, um,

35:01.925 --> 35:05.146
when I was working on
the machine, I opened it enough

35:05.190 --> 35:09.716
to see that a piece of tech from
Project Shepherd made it inside.

35:09.759 --> 35:12.632
Meaning that my mom
built something for good,

35:12.675 --> 35:14.242
and your dad figured out
a way to mess it up.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.723
Yeah, but, I mean,
but if we remove it,

35:16.766 --> 35:18.725
then maybe we can...

35:18.768 --> 35:20.944
find a way to make it purr.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.946
You're here.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.644
I'm here.

35:24.687 --> 35:25.949
Solving a
75-year-old mystery

35:25.993 --> 35:27.777
seems like a pretty
good first date.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.390
What did the
Post-it say?

35:31.433 --> 35:33.566
Look like theories.

35:33.609 --> 35:36.264
"The subatomic nuclei
is oddly equal

35:36.308 --> 35:38.179
to the length
of the endo..."

35:38.223 --> 35:39.528
Endoplasmic reticulum

35:39.572 --> 35:41.226
which seems to be connected

35:41.269 --> 35:43.228
to the porous cytoskeleton.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.446
How do you know that?

35:44.490 --> 35:45.665
You said it.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.928
Tape number four.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.973
You had just
found something

35:50.017 --> 35:52.976
next to Noah's spleen
that-that glowed when you...

35:53.020 --> 35:54.674
poked it.

35:55.675 --> 35:58.547
Yeah. I-I didn't just keep
your tapes, I listened to them,

35:58.591 --> 36:01.637
as a... as a way
to be closer to you.

36:05.380 --> 36:08.992
Wait, i-if these are
my notes...

36:09.036 --> 36:12.387
Heath stole the tapes that were
hidden outside of your house.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.041
God, I-I'm an idiot.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.217
I was lecturing you
about how I knew better,

36:16.261 --> 36:18.132
and the whole time,
your fears were spot-on.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.264
Okay? He played me.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.830
No one could have
anticipated that.

36:20.874 --> 36:23.137
But here I am at the same
crossroads again, so...

36:23.181 --> 36:24.878
Just because we're
at that crossroads doesn't mean

36:24.921 --> 36:27.794
we have to choose the same paths
that divided us before.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.320
This is a second chance.

36:33.495 --> 36:34.801
That's what
I told myself

36:34.844 --> 36:36.194
right before Jones
healed my heart.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.500
I swore that I would
help Michael be...

36:38.544 --> 36:41.808
less... Michael-like.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.593
That I'd help Isobel
find happiness.

36:45.551 --> 36:49.032
And, well, you know,
that maybe...

36:49.076 --> 36:51.731
you and I could walk
on the beach.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.476
The road is literally
right before us,

36:57.519 --> 37:00.522
and I want to
choose with you

37:00.566 --> 37:02.611
where we go next.

37:12.404 --> 37:13.927
It feels like my console.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.885
The pieces of my console,
they want to be together,

37:15.929 --> 37:17.235
but I can shift them.

37:17.278 --> 37:20.368
This thing, it wants
to be closed-- maybe...

37:20.412 --> 37:22.849
maybe I can want it to be open.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.263
Oh.

37:48.701 --> 37:51.051
I was always good
at breaking things.

37:51.094 --> 37:54.315
Wait, this piece of glass
isn't connected properly.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.404
You were right.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.840
Your dad figured
out a way

37:57.884 --> 37:59.233
to get his tech
inside this thing.

38:02.149 --> 38:05.239
If there were ever a good reason
to cut the blue wire...

38:12.464 --> 38:14.204
Okay.
Okay.

38:15.684 --> 38:16.946
I'm gonna use the turquoise.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.861
You're gonna weld
the upper connector back.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.994
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

38:51.677 --> 38:52.808
What are we looking for?

38:52.852 --> 38:54.201
An invoice.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.203
"JD" stands for a
nickname, Johnny Doe.

38:56.246 --> 38:59.337
I found that name
on this giant cross

38:59.380 --> 39:00.686
dedicated by him
and the church.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.122
I'm hoping that
if we can find

39:02.165 --> 39:03.950
an invoice, it'll give us
the real name of the man

39:03.993 --> 39:05.952
that I want to question,
whose necklace you found.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.868
Thanks, Patty, but I'll make
the call from my office.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.915
Window.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.400
Investigative reporters first.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.664
Oh, damn it, DeLuca.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.013
Hey, um,

39:24.057 --> 39:26.233
do you want to get a drink
with me sometime?

39:26.276 --> 39:27.887
- To discuss these findings?
- Oh, God, no.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.716
No, to discuss anything else.

39:30.759 --> 39:33.240
I'd like that.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.594
Hi. Um...

39:39.638 --> 39:40.813
I think
that I am lost.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.641
That's okay.

39:42.684 --> 39:45.818
Sometimes people are lost when
they're searching for Jesus.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.820
Amen to that.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.996
Actually, you know,
I'm-I'm looking to speak

39:50.039 --> 39:52.172
to a member
of your congregation.

39:52.215 --> 39:54.087
I think I have
his necklace.

39:54.130 --> 39:57.046
It has the initials "JD"
on it.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.528
I'll, um...

40:00.572 --> 40:02.443
I'll find him.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.445
Thank you.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.881
Oh, my God.

40:05.925 --> 40:08.493
Is that Camp Mesa Pines?

40:09.581 --> 40:11.452
Yeah. Hey, you know it?

40:11.496 --> 40:13.236
- Yeah.
- Oh, I...

40:13.280 --> 40:15.587
I was practically raised there.

40:15.630 --> 40:16.892
Gosh, a really nice couple,

40:16.936 --> 40:19.895
I had this iron cross
restored for them

40:19.939 --> 40:21.854
as a thank-you.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.726
Yeah.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.424
What is it?

40:26.467 --> 40:27.599
This brain.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.514
It's not human.
I think it's actually...

40:29.557 --> 40:31.429
Iz.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.082
I found the alien
the Lockhart machine's

40:33.126 --> 40:34.519
trying to contact--
his name is Dallas.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.477
He's a preacher at
the Lincoln Neighborhood Church.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.914
His pod landed
in the Mesa Pines Lake.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.568
He went by the name Johnny Doe.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.657
Wait a second.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.093
Did you find anything

40:44.137 --> 40:46.182
about a kid
named Buckskin?

40:46.226 --> 40:48.184
Yeah, for sure.
He was, like, his best friend.

40:48.228 --> 40:50.273
You wanted to see me?

40:50.317 --> 40:51.753
Your suggestion
about checking lipids

40:51.797 --> 40:54.930
to identify the paralytic
you were injected with paid off.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.454
We found its
chemical signature

40:56.497 --> 40:59.892
was proprietary and came
from a lab called Genoryx.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.459
The patent is
registered

41:01.502 --> 41:03.678
to the lead geneticist

41:03.722 --> 41:05.332
Heath Tuchman.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.685
You found the alien.

41:10.729 --> 41:14.254
We found his best friend who's
been trying to save his life.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.867
How'd you find me?

41:18.911 --> 41:21.130
Well, I tried searching
for you in L.A.

41:21.174 --> 41:24.307
Turns out you came back
to New Mexico.

41:24.351 --> 41:25.831
Yeah, you said on the phone

41:25.874 --> 41:27.267
this was a matter
of life and death, Max.

41:27.310 --> 41:29.922
I find those stakes produce
the best results.

41:29.965 --> 41:31.097
Before we discuss

41:31.140 --> 41:32.620
what I'm sure will be

41:32.664 --> 41:34.274
a fruitful partnership...

41:34.317 --> 41:36.494
[phone ringing]...there is one thing
I should clear up.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.192
I'm not Max Evans.

41:46.678 --> 41:49.681
'Round here...

41:49.724 --> 41:51.726
they call me Jones.
