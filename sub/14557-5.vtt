WEBVTT

00:21.755 --> 00:24.592
Daniel, come on, let's go!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.568
Honey, I've got to
get to the lawyers.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.569
I don't want to be late!

00:35.603 --> 00:37.305
DANIEL:
I'll be right down, Mom.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.809
( doorbell rings )

00:46.814 --> 00:50.351
( gunshots )

00:51.219 --> 00:53.087
( car engine starts )

00:53.121 --> 00:55.189
( tires squeal )

01:04.665 --> 01:05.833
Mom?

01:31.292 --> 01:34.628
( garbled police scanner
transmission )

01:34.662 --> 01:37.231
( officers talking
indistinctly )

01:38.932 --> 01:41.569
20 bucks says
that gun goes nowhere.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.604
I don't know, I think
we might find something.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.273
Doesn't look very
professional to me.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.874
Why's that,
'cause he missed?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.842
Pros miss, you know.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.411
Yeah, only this one didn't.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.713
DON:
So who is she?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.748
Victim's name is Lucinda Shay.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.418
Shay... why do I already
know that name?

01:57.451 --> 01:58.852
She was the
Chief Financial Officer

01:58.886 --> 02:00.154
at the Syntel Corporation.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.256
Oh, yeah, that's
that energy company.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.624
The big
stock fraud case.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.692
Bankruptcy, all that?

02:04.725 --> 02:06.527
And Shay was the whistle-blower.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.862
Her testimony was supposed
to sink the other executives.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.432
Looks like she did pretty well
before she blew the whistle.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.766
DAVID: Witness for the
prosecution

02:12.800 --> 02:14.402
doesn't show
for a prep session.

02:14.435 --> 02:18.772
AUSA called the marshals
and they find this.

02:18.806 --> 02:19.707
Multiple gunshots.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.675
They found a Beretta
lying near the body.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.244
Four spent rounds.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.512
Estimated the time of death

02:24.545 --> 02:26.347
a couple of hours ago.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.815
And why weren't
the marshals on it?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.350
Nobody ordered
protective custody.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.518
Why's that?

02:30.551 --> 02:32.753
It's a white collar
fraud case.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.389
Nobody expects Martha Stewart
to go down in a hail of bullets.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.924
We should get
the whereabouts of everybody

02:36.957 --> 02:38.492
she was testifying against,
that's for sure.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.894
You really want to ask
the CEO of the Syntel Corp

02:40.928 --> 02:42.863
where he was at 8:00 a.m.
this morning?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.465
Yeah, that's right.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.633
Thomas Galway.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.235
We'll ask if we get
past the lawyers.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.708
( police scanner transmissions
continues )

03:01.382 --> 03:04.252
We all use math every day.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.254
To predict weather...

03:06.287 --> 03:08.989
to tell time...

03:09.022 --> 03:11.825
to handle money.

03:11.859 --> 03:16.230
Math is more than
formulas and equations,

03:16.264 --> 03:17.365
It's logic.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.533
Math is more than
formulas and equations.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.869
It's rationality.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.671
It's using your mind

03:23.704 --> 03:25.539
to solve the biggest mysteries
we know.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.884
COLBY: This is the preliminary
report

03:36.917 --> 03:38.686
on the shooter's gun,
David.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.788
The serial number
is intact.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.989
Gun show in Nevada,

03:42.022 --> 03:43.624
private collector--

03:43.657 --> 03:46.594
no background check,
no record of sale.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.297
As predicted,
the gun is a dead end.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.964
DAVID: I don't know why that
makes you happy.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.866
That could leave us with
about 6,000 suspects.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.436
Every single
ex-Syntel employee.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.671
We should see if we can
get the whiz kid in here

03:57.705 --> 03:58.506
to give us
a hand.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.440
"Whiz kid"?

04:00.874 --> 04:01.809
I assume you're
talking about me?

04:01.842 --> 04:02.610
Charlie.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.511
COLBY: Hey, I didn't, you
know...

04:03.544 --> 04:04.177
That's all right--
I'm going to choose

04:04.211 --> 04:04.845
to take it as a compliment.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.647
Hey, thanks
for coming.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.648
No problem.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.582
Hey, did the kid
see anything?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.718
Well, if he did,
he's not saying anything.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.053
I didn't know
Lucinda Shay had a kid.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.323
Yeah, a little boy
named Daniel.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.057
DON: What, you knew her?

04:17.090 --> 04:17.991
I met her a few times.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.394
When the scandal first broke
at the SEC,

04:20.428 --> 04:22.463
I was asked to examine
the accounting

04:22.496 --> 04:23.831
related to Syntel's
offshore partnerships.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.065
She was very helpful.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.066
COLBY:
Yeah.

04:26.099 --> 04:26.634
Well, a sweetheart plea bargain

04:26.667 --> 04:28.035
will do that for you.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.437
You know, I don't think
she understood

04:29.470 --> 04:30.738
what Syntel was doing at first.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.072
But once she figured it out,

04:32.105 --> 04:33.441
she blew
the whistle.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.508
Was her son there when...

04:34.542 --> 04:35.443
Yeah.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.910
What can I do?

04:36.944 --> 04:37.911
Well, we're putting together

04:37.945 --> 04:39.580
a list of former employees
and shareholders.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.549
Maybe you could narrow it down?

04:41.582 --> 04:43.584
I've already analyzed
the company's SEC filings.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.720
It's a pretty good picture of
who made money, who lost money.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.589
All right, well, whatever
you can do, we'd appreciate it.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.590
You got it.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.724
Thanks.

04:50.758 --> 04:51.925
What's going to happen
to her son?

04:51.959 --> 04:52.926
We don't know.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.761
She's a single-parent mom.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.396
I'm trying to run down
the father,

04:55.429 --> 04:56.029
any other relative,

04:56.063 --> 04:58.432
but, uh,
so far no luck.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.433
( knocks )

05:01.602 --> 05:02.670
I'll be right back, okay?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.741
How's he doing?

05:07.775 --> 05:10.444
There's some blunt affect
in response to the trauma.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.679
What's that, like some kind of

05:11.712 --> 05:12.980
post-traumatic
shock kind of thing?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.682
A little.
This is more immediate

05:14.715 --> 05:15.549
and hopefully it's temporary.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.918
But he's like
an overloaded circuit.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.820
He's just shut down right now.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.522
I'm going to need him
to talk to us.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.590
I know that.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.758
But he's too fragile right now.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.994
I know, but if he knows
who shot his mother...

05:27.027 --> 05:28.362
It's exactly
the problem.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.329
He probably did,

05:29.363 --> 05:31.365
and he's a little boy
and he's terrified.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.833
And if we push him too far now,

05:32.866 --> 05:33.701
we may never get what we need.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.702
All right,
all right.

05:40.408 --> 05:41.675
Hey, Daniel.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.011
I'm Don Eppes.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.779
Remember? From before?

05:52.119 --> 05:54.955
Look, I'm sorry about what
happened to your mom, but...

05:57.791 --> 05:58.626
You know,

05:58.659 --> 06:00.894
I know how rough
this must be for you,

06:00.928 --> 06:01.695
what you must be thinking.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.436
Actually, you know,
to be honest,

06:08.469 --> 06:09.770
I don't know
what you're thinking,

06:09.803 --> 06:10.804
but I do
know something

06:10.838 --> 06:13.607
about what
you're feeling.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.943
You know, not too long ago
my mom died.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.113
Yeah.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.615
She was like
the one person

06:21.649 --> 06:23.917
who had the right answer
for everything.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.519
You know, I mean all the time.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.822
And then all of a sudden she was
gone.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.561
( sighs )

06:33.594 --> 06:34.462
Here's what
I'm hoping.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.698
That you and I maybe
could partner up.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.633
Maybe help
each other out.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.405
I need to know if you saw
anything this morning, Daniel.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.975
No.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.078
You sure?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.514
The doorbell rang.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.782
( doorbell rings )

06:54.815 --> 06:55.783
DON:
Mm-hmm.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.884
And your mom answered it?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.654
Did you hear any voices?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.925
( gunshots )

07:04.958 --> 07:06.594
Just the gun.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.062
What about after?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.465
Did you see anything,
hear anyone?

07:14.902 --> 07:15.869
All right, okay.

07:15.903 --> 07:16.904
Hey, that's a good start.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.138
Good job.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.142
I want...

07:24.612 --> 07:26.814
I want her to come back.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.518
Yeah...

07:30.551 --> 07:31.151
I know you do.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.786
Me, too.

07:45.699 --> 07:45.833
Charles?

07:47.601 --> 07:48.836
I wish
you wouldn't do that.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.970
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.540
But why are you splitting
a tree-pruning algorithm?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.575
I'm trying to reduce
a cumbersome set of variables

07:54.608 --> 07:55.242
to a common point.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.243
Okay, well,

07:56.276 --> 07:57.778
a bit of pruning I understand,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.513
but why divide it into subsets?

07:59.547 --> 08:00.313
Because
I'm dealing with

08:00.347 --> 08:01.982
two different groups
of suspects,

08:02.015 --> 08:03.851
each with almost
opposite motives

08:03.884 --> 08:04.952
for committing the same crime.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.988
One set lost money
and wants revenge.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.924
The other made money
and wants to keep it.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.159
Oh, this is about
Syntel Corp.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.894
How do you know that?

08:13.927 --> 08:14.862
Well, I heard about

08:14.895 --> 08:15.896
the Chief Financial Officer
being killed.

08:15.929 --> 08:16.897
You might recall

08:16.930 --> 08:18.999
I lost a considerable
investment in Syntel.

08:19.032 --> 08:19.933
Yeah?

08:19.967 --> 08:22.069
Well, you got an alibi
for this morning?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.004
I'm kidding.

08:24.037 --> 08:24.672
Oh, no, don't
be so quick

08:24.705 --> 08:26.874
to dismiss me as a suspect.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.542
Why, how much you lose?

08:28.576 --> 08:30.878
175,000.

08:30.911 --> 08:31.945
Dollars?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.113
Look, in my defense,

08:33.146 --> 08:35.649
I didn't count on
being defrauded.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.349
Wow.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.018
Well, are you okay, financially?

08:38.051 --> 08:41.088
Let's just say the words
"publish or perish"

08:41.121 --> 08:42.756
have taken on
a brand-new meaning.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.224
But, yeah, I mean,
fortunately,

08:44.257 --> 08:46.760
I've hedged my bets on Google.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.028
Well, help me, then.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.664
I've, uh, I've got to combine

08:50.698 --> 08:52.299
two different
groups of suspects,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.735
according to
monetary incentives

08:54.768 --> 08:55.803
and risk-reward ratios.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.005
So we need to rank them
according to their motive

08:58.038 --> 08:58.706
for committing
the murder.

08:58.739 --> 08:59.673
That's right.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.809
Okay, what do these
variables here express?

09:01.842 --> 09:04.044
Well, I derived them
from the bankruptcy data.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.278
I assigned probability values

09:05.312 --> 09:07.848
to motives according to the
suspects' current circumstances.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.716
Current
circumstances.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.084
Like what, where are they now
or...?

09:11.118 --> 09:12.085
Right.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.053
Okay.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.092
Charles...

09:19.126 --> 09:20.160
Hmm?

09:20.193 --> 09:22.195
Just as a thought experiment...

09:22.229 --> 09:23.330
Mm-hmm?

09:23.363 --> 09:26.900
What if you didn't know
the story of the Garden of Eden?

09:26.934 --> 09:27.701
Adam and Eve.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.236
LARRY:
Let's say you met them

09:29.269 --> 09:32.139
after they were exiled
from Eden.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.007
Now, if they both
suffer equally

09:34.041 --> 09:36.009
under the same punishment,

09:36.043 --> 09:39.012
how would you know which
of them had taken the bite

09:39.046 --> 09:41.048
from the forbidden fruit?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.717
CHARLES: The outcome doesn't
provide us enough information

09:43.751 --> 09:46.286
to discern the inputs.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.990
If I really want to figure out
who's guilty,

09:50.023 --> 09:54.127
I've got to reconstruct
the original fraud at Syntel.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.228
Precisely.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.897
You've got to go
back to the apple.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.905
NADINE: Always happy to take a
walk in the park.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.106
DON: Well, just so you know,
I mean,

10:06.139 --> 10:07.941
I know you're prosecuting
Thomas Galway

10:07.975 --> 10:09.109
and the other
Syntel executives.

10:09.142 --> 10:12.145
You caught
the Lucinda Shay murder.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.081
Yeah.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.883
I guess it's true
what they say:

10:15.916 --> 10:18.051
dark clouds do have
silver linings.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.687
Ah, you're
too kind to me.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.520
Gracias.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.255
Look, I figure
losing your witness

10:22.289 --> 10:25.826
is obviously not going to be
great for your case.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.028
Without Shay's testimony,

10:28.061 --> 10:32.032
I can't prove Galway authorized
bogus Syntel accounting.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.867
Right.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.102
Can you put the murder on him?

10:35.135 --> 10:38.005
What, you think a CEO
of a Fortune 500 company

10:38.038 --> 10:39.306
would kill a federal witness?

10:39.339 --> 10:40.173
Pull the trigger?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.742
Probably not.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.043
Galway's pond scum.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.145
If hanging onto $40 million
is involved...

10:45.178 --> 10:46.313
All right, well,
where do I find him?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.248
At the moment,
he's in Vancouver.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.049
What?

10:49.082 --> 10:50.050
Galway rubbed

10:50.083 --> 10:52.085
some pretty
powerful elbows.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.154
The judge gave him
a travel pass.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.322
Unbelievable.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.824
He should be back
tomorrow.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.325
Not that it matters.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.227
Well, why do you say that?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.929
The guy's got a legion
of attorneys.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.264
There's no way they're going
to let him talk to the FBI.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.099
What if I offer him protection?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.471
A revenge thing.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.974
I knew there was
a reason I liked you.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.976
If he turns me down,
he looks guilty.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.978
Because if he's involved
in Lucinda Shay's murder,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.880
the guy knows that he's not
in any danger, right?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.148
It just might get you
in the door.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.216
That's what I'm thinking.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.051
Thanks.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.019
No problem.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.223
Turns out I'm a
pretty cheap date.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.095
Hey, Charlie.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.197
Hey. Seen Don?

11:37.230 --> 11:39.767
He went to meet the prosecutor
in the Syntel case.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.935
They're working some angle to
get us close

11:41.969 --> 11:44.137
to the executives
that were about to go on trial.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.338
Oh, good.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.841
Because my analysis is taking
longer than I anticipated.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.042
Why's that?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.078
I realized that the only way
to accurately assess motive

11:51.111 --> 11:53.246
for any of
these suspects is

11:53.280 --> 11:54.247
to reconstruct
the original fraud.

11:54.281 --> 11:54.915
Oh, yeah?

11:54.948 --> 11:55.715
How long will
that take?

11:55.749 --> 11:57.484
Um, I need to correlate
functions

11:57.517 --> 11:59.152
from several million
transactions

11:59.186 --> 12:01.221
in Syntel's
trading business.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.990
But you know, if I use
the supercomputer at school,

12:03.023 --> 12:04.324
it should only take a few hours.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.859
Yeah? A few hours?
That sounds good.

12:05.893 --> 12:06.994
I'll give them the old

12:07.027 --> 12:08.295
"I'm trying to stop a killer"
line.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.096
Maybe they'll push me up.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.964
- There you go.
- Thanks, Charlie.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.499
How's our kid doing?

12:12.532 --> 12:16.236
Uh, I guess he's a little
better, but you know,

12:16.269 --> 12:18.271
how would any of us
be doing in his situation?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.173
Yeah.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.441
Any word from Family Services?

12:21.474 --> 12:23.143
There is no father
in the picture

12:23.176 --> 12:24.411
and we found a grandmother

12:24.444 --> 12:26.113
in Bethany, Oklahoma.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.849
She has a heart condition
and she can't fly.

12:30.884 --> 12:31.952
So what happens to him?

12:31.985 --> 12:34.154
Well, tonight he's going to go
to this group home.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.188
Oh, come on,

12:35.222 --> 12:36.189
you've got to be
kidding me.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.057
That's a nightmare.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.191
You know what
those places are like.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.492
I know, but I called WITSEC

12:39.526 --> 12:41.161
and they won't put a minor
into custody

12:41.194 --> 12:42.162
without a court order.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.163
And you know what?

12:43.196 --> 12:44.231
It's really not any better

12:44.264 --> 12:45.432
than a group home is, anyway.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.500
I know, but I just don't want
him to get twisted around,

12:47.534 --> 12:48.235
till whatever chance we have

12:48.268 --> 12:50.237
of getting what he knows
is gone.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.372
Well, I don't like this at all,

12:52.405 --> 12:55.275
but you and I aren't
set up to take care of a kid.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.778
What are we
supposed to do?

13:05.218 --> 13:07.120
Charlie, is that you?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.121
No, Dad, it's me.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.122
How you doing?

13:09.156 --> 13:09.923
Fine.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.358
What are you doing
here so late?

13:11.391 --> 13:12.592
Dinner's been
put away already.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.593
No, that's okay.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.895
Look...

13:14.928 --> 13:15.462
If you're looking for Charlie,

13:15.495 --> 13:16.329
he's not here yet.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.999
Actually, I think
I can talk to you.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.234
I'm sure he'll be
okay with it, but...

13:22.469 --> 13:24.037
And who is this?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.306
This is Daniel.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.116
ALAN:
Are you sure we can do this?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.185
I mean, legally?

13:38.218 --> 13:41.221
Yeah, I mean, remember
my friend Nadine?

13:41.254 --> 13:44.191
The prosecutor, she
said it was okay.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.927
Plus, Witness Protection
wouldn't take him.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.329
You do realize that if anything
happened to him,

13:49.362 --> 13:51.098
- it's our responsibility.
- I know.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.033
You're right, it's
probably not a good idea.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.202
I don't know, I mean...

13:55.235 --> 13:56.336
As opposed to what--
putting him in one

13:56.369 --> 13:58.405
of those homes the same night
his mother was murdered?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.107
That's what I thought.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.574
What I meant was...

14:01.608 --> 14:03.643
something better not
happen to him.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.645
Yeah, I know.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.414
Don't worry,
you did the right thing.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.918
Thanks.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.085
Hey, buddy.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.456
He makes
a pretty good sandwich, huh?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.892
Mom's is better.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.496
Yeah.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.166
Yeah, I'm sure that's true.

14:26.199 --> 14:30.137
I was thinking about
what you asked me.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.306
You know, about what I saw?

14:33.340 --> 14:34.674
Uh-huh.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.742
There was a car.

14:35.775 --> 14:40.047
After I heard the gunshot,
I looked out the window.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.181
Do you remember

14:41.214 --> 14:42.449
what kind of car it was?

14:42.482 --> 14:46.486
It was black
or blue, maybe.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.988
Big...

14:48.021 --> 14:50.390
but not as big as an SUV.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.360
You think if I showed you some
pictures, maybe you'd remember?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.529
I mean, you just have
to do the best you can.

14:56.563 --> 15:01.268
It's, uh...

15:01.301 --> 15:04.271
So did you find them?

15:04.304 --> 15:06.339
Who?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.341
The people who killed my mom.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.243
Why do you think...

15:10.277 --> 15:12.645
I mean, are you
remembering something?

15:12.679 --> 15:15.448
They were talking...

15:15.482 --> 15:18.952
at your office.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.488
They said there are, like,

15:21.521 --> 15:25.258
6,000 people who wanted
to kill my mom.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.093
Oh, no, no, no.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.296
Oh, no, that's not,
that's not...

15:29.329 --> 15:32.732
I think the thing
is, um, you know,

15:32.765 --> 15:35.335
sometimes when we don't
know who the bad guys are,

15:35.368 --> 15:38.371
we start with a
really big list.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.273
And, uh, it
doesn't mean

15:40.307 --> 15:42.309
everyone on it wanted
to hurt your mom.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.577
I mean, in fact, I really
think we're probably just

15:44.611 --> 15:46.179
looking for one person.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.286
Where am I gonna sleep?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.388
I thought I'd put
you up in my room.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.423
How's that?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.558
Where will you sleep?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.627
I don't live here-- it's
from when I was a kid.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.695
But it's a pretty good room--
I think you'll like it.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.064
But you're gonna stay, right?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.733
You're not gonna leave?

16:06.766 --> 16:08.468
Yeah, I can stay, sure.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.569
Yeah.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.039
You got it.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.408
DAVID: Here's another one for
Lucinda Shay.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.444
"If God strikes you down
tomorrow,

16:17.477 --> 16:20.113
my prayers have been answered."

16:20.147 --> 16:22.415
Buddy, that doesn't even
move the needle.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.117
Look at this one.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.220
"I'm gonna bleed you dry, bitch,
just like you bled my family."

16:27.254 --> 16:29.289
Tell me this guy's up
on the board?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.290
Yeah, big time.
He's right there.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.492
We're not narrowing it
down, though, are we?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.527
Well, Don's still waiting
to hear back from Charlie, so...

16:34.561 --> 16:36.729
I really figure one of the
executives for this, you know?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.665
Maybe even Galway.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.633
But there's some real
hostility here, man.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.701
Ah, you can't blame them.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.271
These people got shafted
when Syntel went bankrupt.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.473
They lost their life
savings, their pensions.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.407
Meantime, the executives,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.609
including Lucinda Shay,
they all got rich.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.443
Yeah.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.278
MEGAN:
Hey, have either of you guys

16:51.311 --> 16:53.280
found something
on Morton Standbury?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.315
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Morton Standbury.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.649
Here he is--
he was in Marketing

16:56.683 --> 16:57.650
pretty low level, though.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.818
Why?

16:58.851 --> 16:59.952
He's got a bunch
of write-ups

16:59.986 --> 17:02.389
in his HR file-- supervisor said
he had a quick temper.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.490
I think we should
be concentrating

17:03.523 --> 17:04.724
on the real threats.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.294
We read this guy's letters.
They all seem to be pretty tame.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.229
MEGAN: Well, the more aggressive
stuff is actually therapeutic.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.464
It's kind of giving a voice
to your rage.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.333
It's not nice,
but it's healthy.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.801
Standbury, on the other hand,
his anger

17:14.834 --> 17:17.137
is controlled,
it's almost methodical.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.139
He blew up
at his exit interview,

17:19.172 --> 17:21.308
so much so, that they pushed
for a psych consult.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.243
No. Sounds like he goes
up on the board.

17:23.276 --> 17:23.610
Yeah.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.486
You were here last night?

17:33.520 --> 17:34.687
Yeah.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.356
Why didn't you sleep
in your room?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.358
- Well...
- Dad went out.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.460
Yeah, he went to
pick up some food.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.095
Right, so who's upstairs?

17:42.129 --> 17:43.530
Look, I couldn't
get ahold of you,

17:43.563 --> 17:46.499
so I asked him, and he
said it would be okay.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.268
Okay for what?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.237
For Lucinda Shay's
kid to stay here.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.406
Of course, yeah, that's fine.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.574
Daniel Shay is upstairs?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.242
Look. I also I need another
favor.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.243
I got to get to the airport

17:56.276 --> 17:57.210
to see if can I catch
up with Thomas Galway.

17:57.244 --> 17:57.744
You think you can hang
here just for a bit

17:57.777 --> 18:00.513
until he gets back?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.150
You need me to baby-sit.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.251
I just don't think it's good
to leave him here alone.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.218
I agree.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.653
Actually, I have a way
with children, so...

18:06.686 --> 18:08.155
Oh, yeah?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.722
Yeah. I've been told I do.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.757
Good.
It's just for ten minutes.

18:10.790 --> 18:11.458
Come on, I'll introduce you.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.292
All right.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.496
( engine whirring )

18:30.510 --> 18:32.111
( tires screeching )

18:36.416 --> 18:37.384
Stay in the vehicle, sir.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.252
Hands on the dashboard, please?

18:39.286 --> 18:41.354
Thank goodness we're
offering him protection.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.255
FBI.

18:44.191 --> 18:44.924
DON:
I assume you all have permits

18:44.957 --> 18:47.660
for those bulges
in your jackets?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.196
- Yeah.
- What's your deal here?

18:49.229 --> 18:50.663
BODYGUARD: Private detail for
Mr. Galway.

18:50.697 --> 18:51.631
- DON: Uh-huh.
- If you want

18:51.664 --> 18:53.700
to know more, you'll
have to speak to him.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.634
I do want to know more--
gonna want to see permits, too.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.568
Thomas Galway.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.770
- Is there a problem?
- Don Eppes, FBI.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.372
I'm Agent Megan Reeves.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.274
I'm Edward Barret,
I'm Mr. Galway's attorney.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.342
What's this about?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.943
Well, we've reason to believe
your client here,

19:03.976 --> 19:05.412
his life might be in danger.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.579
- Is he joking?
- Do we seem

19:06.613 --> 19:08.315
like we're kidding?

19:08.348 --> 19:10.450
I assume this concerns
the death of Lucinda Shay?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.552
Well, it's a murder,
actually.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.354
And we have no reason
to believe it doesn't.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.188
MEGAN:
Unless you know

19:15.222 --> 19:16.423
something we don't?

19:16.456 --> 19:17.624
I've got nothing
to say to you.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.758
Well, all due respect, sir,

19:18.791 --> 19:21.261
for someone who was just told
their life is in danger,

19:21.294 --> 19:22.262
you don't seem very afraid.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.332
Dad...

19:25.365 --> 19:27.467
My father did receive
a threat on his life

19:27.500 --> 19:28.868
early yesterday morning.

19:29.802 --> 19:30.570
Malcolm.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.973
I received a note at the house.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.608
Is there any reason
you didn't notify us?

19:35.642 --> 19:37.344
You expect me
to notify the people

19:37.377 --> 19:40.280
who are trying to put me
in prison?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.549
I expect to see
that note, sir, and I will.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.352
We'll be waiting
for your subpoena.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.820
( engine starts )

19:47.854 --> 19:49.856
MEGAN:
That went really well.

20:03.670 --> 20:08.241
Miss your mom, huh?

20:08.275 --> 20:11.411
Yeah.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.382
I miss my wife sometimes.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.289
I lost her about a year
and a half ago.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.761
You know...
it's really okay

20:28.795 --> 20:32.365
to miss someone
that you love.

20:32.399 --> 20:36.903
Well, uh...
I think somewhere...

20:36.936 --> 20:40.407
it might even
make them happy.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.275
Sounds weird, huh?

20:42.309 --> 20:44.777
No.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.447
No.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.585
You just reminded me of Don.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.588
Really?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.724
Yeah.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.292
Yeah, I'll tell
you a secret.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.528
When he was your age,

21:01.561 --> 21:04.631
he would never let
anyone see him cry.

21:04.664 --> 21:08.435
He wanted everyone to think
that he was a tough guy.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.605
Still does sometimes.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.378
So what is that
you're reading?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.548
It's a book on cars.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.450
Mm.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.953
Don gave it to me
to try and help me remember.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.756
Can I see it?

21:36.563 --> 21:39.666
So does he ever cry now?

21:39.699 --> 21:41.368
Who, Don?

21:41.401 --> 21:43.403
Eh, I don't know.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.705
Some wise man
once told him

21:45.738 --> 21:49.942
that it was all right
to cry when he's sad.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.479
And, um...

21:52.512 --> 21:57.450
this wise man,
well... he's hoping

21:57.484 --> 22:01.388
that someday Don's going
to figure out it's okay.

22:03.523 --> 22:06.626
Are you that wise man?

22:08.761 --> 22:10.763
Well, that's another secret.

22:10.797 --> 22:11.764
( chuckles lightly )

22:15.468 --> 22:19.639
( scribbling,
pecking )

22:21.774 --> 22:24.343
( pecking continues )

22:34.554 --> 22:36.022
( chuckles )

22:36.055 --> 22:37.424
Charlie.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.858
Don sent me down
to check and see

22:38.891 --> 22:40.427
what you got
from the supercomputer.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.728
He must not have
gotten my message.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.498
I guess not--
ooh, can I take one of these?

22:45.532 --> 22:46.533
Which message?

22:46.566 --> 22:48.635
There was a glitch
in the data run.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.037
Can you just tell me
which one you're taking?

22:51.070 --> 22:53.005
This red one.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.574
That's very interesting.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.543
Okay.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.445
So how little is this glitch,
because Megan profiled

22:58.478 --> 23:01.748
seven ex-employees, all who have
the potential to be the killer.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.617
And anything you have
might help us take this guy down

23:04.651 --> 23:06.519
before he has a chance
to shoot another Syntel exec.

23:06.553 --> 23:10.523
I think I have one of these
names on my list, actually.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.793
Yeah, Morton Standbury...
but the probability.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.728
of Morton's guilt is
less than ten percent.

23:15.762 --> 23:16.529
( dialing phone )

23:16.563 --> 23:17.797
I mean, that's
hardly conclusive.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.865
Awesome. Thanks.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.433
David, hey, it's me.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.902
Listen, Megan was right on
with her hunch.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.837
The Standbury guy is a match.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.742
MEGAN:
How'd you find him?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.644
Wife's credit
card you gave us.

23:31.678 --> 23:32.879
What'd she have to say?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.748
That Standbury's angry, blames
Syntel for their situation.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.216
She thinks he might have
cracked-- is he here?

23:37.249 --> 23:38.485
Talked to the manager,
he hasn't seen him,

23:38.518 --> 23:41.521
but I showed him the warrant,
and he gave us the key, so...

23:41.554 --> 23:42.822
He's on the third floor.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.056
There's two stairwells,

23:44.090 --> 23:45.825
but this one over here
is blocked off

23:45.858 --> 23:47.159
because of
an earthquake retrofit.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.428
Let's check it out.

23:55.968 --> 23:59.806
Morton Standbury!

23:59.839 --> 24:01.641
FBI! We have
a warrant!

24:10.517 --> 24:11.150
MEGAN:
Clear.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.585
Clear.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.225
MEGAN:
Oh, boy.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.803
Oh, check this out.

24:30.837 --> 24:31.838
I got Thomas Galway,

24:33.039 --> 24:36.242
Lucinda Shay,
and a whole slew

24:36.275 --> 24:37.644
of Syntel execs.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.845
That's everybody.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.212
( rattling )

24:46.152 --> 24:48.087
- We'll take the other stairway.
- I'm with you.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.524
Put the bag
down and stop!

24:51.558 --> 25:00.900
I said put the bag down
and stop running!

25:00.933 --> 25:03.102
COLBY:
I said drop the bag!

25:03.135 --> 25:04.270
He's got a gun!

25:04.303 --> 25:06.072
David, Megan,
he's got a gun!

25:06.105 --> 25:07.840
Gun!

25:09.241 --> 25:10.810
Ma'am, step inside.
Step inside.

25:10.843 --> 25:11.711
Put it down now!

25:12.812 --> 25:13.746
Drop the gun!

25:13.780 --> 25:16.849
Drop it!

25:16.883 --> 25:19.218
Don't make this any harder than
it needs to be, Mr. Standbury!

25:19.251 --> 25:20.853
I'm not doing anything for you!

25:20.887 --> 25:23.255
We're FBI!
We just want to talk to you!

25:23.289 --> 25:24.123
You're FBI?

25:24.156 --> 25:26.025
I talked to your wife,
Mr. Standbury.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.894
She's very worried about you.

25:27.927 --> 25:28.895
My wife... What are you...

25:28.928 --> 25:31.831
How do I know
that you're who you say you are?

25:34.100 --> 25:34.767
Okay?

25:34.801 --> 25:36.569
Here you go.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.270
Now toss the gun.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.743
All right.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.279
Toss the bag!

25:47.313 --> 25:48.815
Down on your knees.

25:48.848 --> 25:49.949
On your knees!

25:49.982 --> 25:51.784
Hands behind
your head, now!

25:51.818 --> 25:52.852
You do not understand. Please.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.889
Let me stop them.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.558
We're more worried about
stopping you now, Mr. Standbury.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.068
DON: You think he sent it?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.937
The Galway death threat?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.171
Yeah.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.240
Standbury's letters
to Lucinda Shay

26:14.273 --> 26:15.742
were different,
you know?

26:15.775 --> 26:17.276
They were long,
detailed accusations,

26:17.309 --> 26:18.945
and this one
just says

26:18.978 --> 26:22.081
"you're next,"
so no, it doesn't fit

26:22.114 --> 26:23.082
the pattern.

26:23.115 --> 26:23.883
Did the lab
get anything?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.785
Apparently there's
nothing to get.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.955
There's just a fax sent
directly to the courier.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.023
Well, there's a tag line
on the sending machine, no?

26:31.057 --> 26:32.625
Well, it was sent
from a computer,

26:32.659 --> 26:33.926
and we didn't find one
at the motel,

26:33.960 --> 26:36.062
and David and Colby are
tossing the house now.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.797
But, you know,
he really could have sent it

26:37.830 --> 26:39.799
from any public terminal.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.100
Right.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.969
TERRY: But he's saying this
whole thing

26:43.002 --> 26:45.037
is just
a misunderstanding.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.305
And what does he mean
by that?

26:46.338 --> 26:47.239
I don't know.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.975
You're going to have
to ask him yourself.

26:49.008 --> 26:49.909
He's refusing to
speak to anyone

26:49.942 --> 26:53.279
but the lead agent
on the investigation.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.055
You want to tell me
what you're doing

27:03.089 --> 27:03.923
with surveillance photos

27:03.956 --> 27:06.793
of Syntel executives,
Mr. Standbury?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.061
( scoffs )

27:10.697 --> 27:12.098
Are you the man in charge here?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.099
As far as you're
concerned,

27:13.132 --> 27:14.300
I am.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.068
You guys really dropped the ball

27:16.102 --> 27:17.236
on Lucinda Shay,
didn't you?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.772
Are you proud of what you did?

27:19.806 --> 27:21.741
Is that it?

27:21.774 --> 27:23.309
I mean, I've got
her 11-year-old boy out there.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.443
You want to tell him about it?

27:24.476 --> 27:28.147
Don't you dare try to put
that woman's murder on me.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.448
I told you people.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.350
You told us what?

27:31.383 --> 27:33.720
They think they're going to get
away with it, but they're not.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.756
Killing her,
it's not going to matter.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.992
They want to play hardball
with Morton Standbury, well...

27:40.026 --> 27:42.929
they don't know
what hardball is.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.865
I've been collecting evidence
for the lawyer lady.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.299
You're talking
about the U.S. attorney?

27:47.333 --> 27:50.036
She thinks she knows what's
going on, but she doesn't.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.139
The people that she's after--
she's not going to find them.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.874
No?

27:54.907 --> 27:57.109
I tried to tell her.

27:57.143 --> 28:00.312
I lost everything--
my job, my savings.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.782
( sighs )

28:02.815 --> 28:06.452
But they're not going
to get away with it.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.832
What are you doing?

28:21.267 --> 28:25.304
Didn't see you there.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.074
What is all that?

28:28.107 --> 28:33.079
I'm trying to resolve
an anomaly in my data.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.347
What does that mean?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.516
Um...

28:37.549 --> 28:39.919
it means that something,

28:39.952 --> 28:42.755
um, in this
big equation here

28:42.789 --> 28:44.991
doesn't make sense,

28:45.024 --> 28:47.293
and I'm trying
to figure out why.

28:47.326 --> 28:53.265
It's as if those
that made money

28:53.299 --> 28:53.332
and those that lost money
are canceling each other out.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.002
Your brother said
you knew my mom.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.439
Yeah. I did.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.175
I didn't know her well.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.377
You know, I only met her
a couple of times.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.148
But I liked her.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.786
What she did
took a lot of courage.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.056
She was pretty nervous.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.858
She didn't
think I knew,

29:18.891 --> 29:20.426
but I did.

29:22.028 --> 29:26.565
Sometimes it's hard
to do the right thing.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.001
That's what she
always says.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.436
You know,

29:30.469 --> 29:31.437
that nobody's perfect.

29:41.413 --> 29:44.550
It is an imperfect world,
isn't it?

30:00.599 --> 30:03.035
Your mother was
a very smart lady.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.583
Yeah, I remember him-- he called
my office a bunch of times,

30:17.616 --> 30:20.853
told my assistant he had
evidence against Syntel.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.421
- Did you talk to him?
- He showed up

30:22.454 --> 30:25.191
with a grocery bag
full of magazine cutouts

30:25.224 --> 30:26.558
and stuff he got
off the Internet.

30:26.592 --> 30:27.559
We had him pegged

30:27.593 --> 30:28.560
as a nut.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.695
Well, he's a nut
with an alibi,

30:29.728 --> 30:31.597
'cause three different people
at Kinkos remember him.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.299
He was there all day
photocopying stuff

30:33.332 --> 30:34.500
out of the grocery bag.

30:34.533 --> 30:37.003
Great, so here we are,
back at square one.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.304
Not necessarily.
Your brother's here.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.272
He's really excited
about something.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.874
Oh, yeah?

30:44.210 --> 30:46.445
To properly assess the motive

30:46.478 --> 30:48.414
for killing Lucinda Shay,
I needed

30:48.447 --> 30:50.616
to reconstruct
the original fraud at Syntel.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.618
And you were
able to do that?

30:52.651 --> 30:54.486
Yes, and I think you have

30:54.520 --> 30:57.489
a very strong case
against Syntel, by the way.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.459
Mm, the Eppes family's
full of silver linings.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.129
So, Syntel is
an energy company, right?

31:03.162 --> 31:04.964
Yes, natural gas,
oil, electricity.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.465
Right, but where
they really made their money

31:06.498 --> 31:08.367
was trading energy futures.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.002
There's nothing
illegal about that.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.270
No, you're right.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.604
However, when
I was analyzing

31:12.638 --> 31:14.506
the trading patterns at Syntel,

31:14.540 --> 31:17.376
I found a trading group
who was perfect,

31:17.409 --> 31:20.246
always, never wrong, once.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.213
How can they never be wrong?

31:21.247 --> 31:22.281
Trading futures

31:22.314 --> 31:24.150
is really just betting
on the price of something

31:24.183 --> 31:25.584
in the future,

31:25.617 --> 31:27.553
and these traders manipulated
the future.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.221
Wait, so you're saying
they're cheating.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.392
Syntel controlled
key sections

31:33.425 --> 31:35.027
of the power grid,
so all they had to do

31:35.061 --> 31:36.428
was shut down a switch,

31:36.462 --> 31:38.297
say it was
for maintenance,

31:38.330 --> 31:40.066
and the energy supply
was restricted.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.700
Right, and demand
drives up the price.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.534
Exactly.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.236
How much are we
talking about here?

31:44.270 --> 31:49.241
These five traders made profits
of $312 million.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.943
TERRY: Three hundred...

31:50.977 --> 31:52.044
Charlie, can you prove this?

31:52.078 --> 31:53.045
Well, the proof
is in the perfection.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.680
"Nobody's perfect"
is not just an expression.

31:54.713 --> 31:55.581
In this case,

31:55.614 --> 31:58.017
it's a statistically
demonstrable fact.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.451
Our case against Galway
was focused

31:59.485 --> 32:01.153
on debts that Syntel

32:01.187 --> 32:02.521
is hiding
in offshore companies.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.689
But these Syntel traders--

32:03.722 --> 32:05.291
this is the first
I've heard about it.

32:05.324 --> 32:05.992
And I didn't
figure it out

32:06.025 --> 32:08.194
until I re-engineered the fraud.

32:08.227 --> 32:08.927
I mean,
it wasn't obvious.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.662
You'd have to be
looking for it

32:10.696 --> 32:13.032
like I was or be the author
of the original accounting.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.000
Lucinda Shay designed

32:14.033 --> 32:17.003
all of Syntel's
financial reporting systems.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.504
Could she have found it?

32:18.537 --> 32:20.306
Yes, and I think
there's a very high probability

32:20.339 --> 32:21.307
that she would have.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.508
Well, then I think

32:22.541 --> 32:24.243
she must have been killed
to hide this.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.244
Right.

32:25.277 --> 32:25.844
So we might be looking
at the wrong group here.

32:25.877 --> 32:26.512
Oh, you
definitely are.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.313
I mean, before I factored in

32:27.346 --> 32:29.615
this manipulation
by the traders,

32:29.648 --> 32:32.151
none of the executives
who were indicted

32:32.184 --> 32:34.420
or their former employees
scored nearly high enough

32:34.453 --> 32:36.422
to be considered suspects.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.490
Any idea who does?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.727
Five perfect traders.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.696
Those are the people
you should be looking for.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.570
So I thought Charlie
cleared Galway

32:51.603 --> 32:53.239
along with the
other executives.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.473
Yeah, well, I asked Charlie

32:54.506 --> 32:56.708
to run his motive model again,
factoring in the possibility

32:56.742 --> 32:59.245
that someone knew Lucinda Shay
was on to the fraud.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.179
And?

33:00.212 --> 33:02.414
Mr. Galway popped
right back into view.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.750
So if he's a part
of the fraud,

33:04.783 --> 33:06.785
then, huh, he sent himself
a death threat?

33:06.818 --> 33:08.787
DON: Makes him look like a
target, gets us to take

33:08.820 --> 33:10.322
our eyes off him as a suspect.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.723
Yeah, I'll call you back.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.092
Agent Eppes.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.360
Uh, we're looking
for your father.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.661
We were told
we might find him here.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.029
Yeah, he just left.
Is there a problem?

33:19.365 --> 33:20.432
Is it about the note?

33:20.466 --> 33:23.502
I'm sorry, we don't
discuss ongoing investigations.

33:23.535 --> 33:28.274
My father is under a lot
of pressure right now, okay?

33:28.307 --> 33:29.341
Yeah, committing

33:29.375 --> 33:31.310
stock fraud
could do that to you.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.612
And I know what you're thinking,
but you know, a CEO of a company

33:33.645 --> 33:35.547
like Syntel cannot be
responsible for everything

33:35.581 --> 33:37.516
everyone is doing
at his company.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.351
Was your father involved
in the trading business at all?

33:39.385 --> 33:41.287
Yeah, of course. It's one of
our most profitable divisions.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.022
Well, most profitable
for some, right?

33:45.157 --> 33:46.792
You know, I don't think

33:46.825 --> 33:49.495
my father should talk
to you guys after all.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.063
What are you
worried about?

33:51.097 --> 33:53.165
Your father's just an
innocent CEO, right?

33:53.199 --> 33:55.201
If your father's
involved

33:55.234 --> 33:56.668
in a murder, protecting him
could land you

33:56.702 --> 33:57.769
in a hell of a lot of trouble.

33:57.803 --> 33:58.937
Yeah, my father
is not a murderer.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.840
Well, someone left Lucinda
Shay's son without a mother.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.109
An 11-year-old boy.

34:03.142 --> 34:03.842
So you still
think your father

34:03.875 --> 34:05.577
shouldn't talk to us?

34:12.351 --> 34:13.485
It's the middle
of the day.

34:13.519 --> 34:14.686
What are you
doing here?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.822
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, I was at the airport.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.590
I thought I'd swing by
and see how the kid's doing.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.326
Well, this is not on the way
from the airport.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.693
- Whatever. Where is he?
- He's right here.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.729
Oh. Thanks.

34:23.762 --> 34:24.796
Hey, buddy.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.732
How you doing?

34:28.600 --> 34:31.570
I've been trying to remember,
but I can't.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.172
Oh, well, that's okay.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.506
Don't worry about it.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.608
Look, if it's in here,
it'll come out.

34:36.642 --> 34:39.278
I mean, when you're ready,
you'll probably be able

34:39.311 --> 34:40.812
to see it
just like you were there,

34:40.846 --> 34:42.248
so-so don't stress about it,
okay?

34:42.281 --> 34:44.350
Can I get you anything?

34:49.488 --> 34:51.190
What's going on?
You okay?

34:51.223 --> 34:53.725
The bad guys-- will they...

34:53.759 --> 34:55.727
Will they come after me?

34:58.297 --> 34:59.097
Uh...

35:00.432 --> 35:01.633
Look, I'll tell you what.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.801
That's not gonna happen.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.403
You want to know why?

35:04.436 --> 35:05.804
'Cause we're partners.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.174
Partners get each other's backs,
and nothing is going

35:08.207 --> 35:09.408
to happen to you, okay?

35:09.441 --> 35:11.210
'Cause you're my partner.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.844
All right?

35:12.878 --> 35:14.580
Oh, and they spoke
to your grandmother.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.581
They did?

35:15.614 --> 35:16.582
Yeah, she's making arrangements

35:16.615 --> 35:18.317
to get you, and
she's very excited to see you.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.755
Look, Daniel,
I'll be honest with you.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.757
It's gonna tough
for-for a while,

35:25.791 --> 35:28.494
but you'll get through it,
you're gonna be okay.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.561
You know how I know that?

35:30.796 --> 35:32.531
'Cause I'm a good judge
of people,

35:32.564 --> 35:34.566
and you're gonna be okay.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.701
All right?

35:35.734 --> 35:36.702
All right.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.637
I'll check in with you later.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.542
What?

35:43.575 --> 35:45.477
Nothing.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.849
( sighs )

35:50.882 --> 35:53.185
Do you have any idea

35:53.219 --> 35:55.187
what I could do

35:55.221 --> 35:57.556
with $300 million?

35:57.589 --> 35:59.925
Three hundred
and twelve.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.293
You said you were all right.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.594
No, I am.
I was talking

36:02.628 --> 36:03.762
about my application

36:03.795 --> 36:05.497
for the Talis Foundation
Research Grant.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.498
Why are you
worried

36:06.532 --> 36:07.899
- about that?
- Because

36:07.933 --> 36:10.569
Ivan Tsgorski has taken over
the chairmanship

36:10.602 --> 36:12.271
of the grant committee.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.806
You attacked his theory
on polarization flux.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.443
I merely pointed out
certain characteristics

36:17.476 --> 36:19.478
of gravitational waves
that he had chosen to ignore.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.746
Larry,

36:20.779 --> 36:22.681
I was there
when he gave that paper.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.650
And you stood up and
you called him a big,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.985
fat cheater in front
of a room full of people.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.754
Well, no. Now
you're exaggerating.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.689
That room could not
have been more than half full.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.858
Might we get back on task?

36:32.891 --> 36:35.261
All right, okay,
the money, the money, the money.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.996
The money is not
where we thought it would be.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.399
It should show up
in the company's

36:40.432 --> 36:41.867
cash flow statements, after

36:41.900 --> 36:43.402
the fraudulent
transactions.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.670
- Yeah, but it doesn't.
- No.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.772
You know, all these funds--

36:46.805 --> 36:49.675
they would have been transferred
electronically, correct?

36:49.708 --> 36:50.742
I imagine so.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.511
Electronic transactions

36:52.544 --> 36:54.446
have no mass

36:54.480 --> 36:55.914
and cannot be constrained
in the manner

36:55.947 --> 36:57.316
of physical objects.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.685
But they are bound
by time, Larry,

36:59.718 --> 37:03.021
and time only flows
one way.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.257
Are you aware you
have standing water

37:05.291 --> 37:06.258
in this corner?

37:06.292 --> 37:07.293
I know about the leak.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.494
I called maintenance.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.795
And?

37:09.828 --> 37:12.431
And they've got
to tear out the wall

37:12.464 --> 37:14.433
and find the source
of the leak.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.667
What is with you
today, Larry?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.569
All I ask is
for a little focus.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.438
Now, what are we missing?

37:19.471 --> 37:21.540
What are you doing?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.842
I'm finding the leak.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.647
Well... you're making a mess.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.948
Well, by staining

37:29.981 --> 37:31.417
the currents,

37:31.450 --> 37:33.685
we can observe
the ink spread out

37:33.719 --> 37:35.721
on the pooled water, and then

37:35.754 --> 37:38.490
figure out the
flow pattern.

37:38.524 --> 37:40.292
And once we know how it flows...

37:40.326 --> 37:41.927
Yeah, you see?

37:41.960 --> 37:44.596
It's not coming down
from the wall.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.633
It's coming up from the floor.

37:54.473 --> 37:57.042
We were assuming the
money flowed downstream

37:57.075 --> 37:59.345
from the transaction, so
we were looking for it

37:59.378 --> 38:00.579
after the trades.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.614
But the money was
diverted upstream.

38:02.648 --> 38:03.515
Upstream? So you're saying

38:03.549 --> 38:05.917
the money was moved
before the trades?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.553
To an offshore
partnership set up

38:07.586 --> 38:09.421
in the Syntel executives'
original fraud.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.423
I applied principles
of fluid dynamics

38:11.457 --> 38:12.724
to the cash
flow statements.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.460
I found
that the money was transferred

38:14.493 --> 38:15.527
through a series of loans.

38:15.561 --> 38:17.896
So the traders used the fraud
to hide the theft?

38:17.929 --> 38:18.830
Precisely.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.332
DON:
Wait, someone eventually

38:20.366 --> 38:23.435
would figure out
that $300 million was missing.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.503
The traders knew

38:24.536 --> 38:26.872
that the loans would be
written off in bankruptcy,

38:26.905 --> 38:29.708
and after that, no one would
come looking for the money.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.676
MEGAN:
No one, except

38:30.709 --> 38:32.010
Lucinda Shay.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.680
Guys, you'd better
come see this.

38:34.713 --> 38:35.647
You find the traders?

38:35.681 --> 38:37.649
Not exactly.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.020
Did you run the
Social Security numbers?

38:42.053 --> 38:43.522
That's the problem.

38:43.555 --> 38:44.956
Show us.
Run them again.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.093
( beeping )

38:48.126 --> 38:49.561
See?

38:49.595 --> 38:50.729
- Yeah. Run the next one.
- All right.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.799
( beep )

38:53.832 --> 38:55.567
It's the same thing.
These traders don't exist.

38:55.601 --> 38:56.768
MEGAN:
But that doesn't make any sense.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.069
How can they not be real?

38:58.103 --> 38:59.505
CHARLIE:
It does make sense.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.773
It's just a different kind
of sense.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.642
Wh-What does that even mean,
Charlie?

39:03.675 --> 39:05.711
Remember, the traders
were too good to be true.

39:05.744 --> 39:06.978
It's reasonable
to expect

39:07.012 --> 39:08.580
that they are actually false.

39:08.614 --> 39:09.715
Did Standbury say

39:09.748 --> 39:10.982
these people
weren't real?

39:11.016 --> 39:12.618
No, he said
we would never find them.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.486
What, do you think
he'd figure it out?

39:14.520 --> 39:15.887
I don't know,
but he's right.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.956
All right, look, I mean,
where are we right now?

39:17.989 --> 39:19.157
The suspect must be
from Syntel's

39:19.190 --> 39:20.158
energy trading business.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.059
That variable hasn't changed.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.595
I've been through Syntel's
HR reports.

39:23.629 --> 39:24.663
Eppes.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.498
Wait, wait, h-hold on.
Dad, Dad, Dad, slow down.

39:26.532 --> 39:27.533
You're not making any sense.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.668
Right, don't-don't
touch anything, don't leave.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.069
- I'm on my way.
- What's up?

39:31.102 --> 39:32.538
The kid is missing.

39:37.676 --> 39:38.677
I left him alone

39:38.710 --> 39:39.678
for, what... it
couldn't have been

39:39.711 --> 39:40.679
more than
five minutes!

39:40.712 --> 39:41.547
It's okay, Mr. Eppes.
We're gonna find him.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.280
I went into the kitchen
to get a couple

39:42.313 --> 39:43.715
a couple of cans
of soda for us.

39:43.749 --> 39:44.516
He was standing right

39:44.550 --> 39:45.717
over there,
right by the table.

39:45.751 --> 39:46.752
He couldn't have gotten away.

39:46.785 --> 39:47.586
It's not your fault,

39:47.619 --> 39:49.054
so could you please
just calm down?

39:49.087 --> 39:50.689
'Cause you're not
helping the situation.

39:50.722 --> 39:51.356
I would have seen him!

39:51.389 --> 39:52.424
Hey, Don, give me a second.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.125
I just talked to David.
He said he found something

39:54.159 --> 39:55.226
in the Syntel
employment records.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.195
Charlie, you got to keep the
line clear. Say what?

39:57.228 --> 39:58.664
CHARLIE: Okay. Can you hold on a
second?

39:58.697 --> 40:00.432
Dad said he saw him here.

40:00.466 --> 40:03.068
I hit redial.
It's National Cab Company.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.470
Cab? Why the hell
would he take a cab?

40:04.503 --> 40:05.336
SCANLON:
All right, I'm on the cab.

40:05.370 --> 40:06.404
Call me as soon as
you get anything.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.474
Megan, come with me.
I think I know where he is.

40:16.615 --> 40:17.949
Go that way.
I'll check upstairs.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.163
Daniel.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.599
You okay, buddy?

40:33.632 --> 40:35.066
Yeah?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.234
Yeah, I was
pretty worried.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.036
I'm sorry.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.705
You don't have to
be sorry. I just...

40:39.738 --> 40:41.773
I'm glad
you're okay.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.809
Did you come back to see if
you could remember the car?

40:48.279 --> 40:50.248
It was a Mercedes.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.118
I saw the circle
in the book.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.488
You remember.

40:56.522 --> 40:57.455
Good job.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.132
These are employment records
for the five traders.

41:07.165 --> 41:08.500
Uh-huh.

41:08.534 --> 41:10.869
Look who signed
as the hiring manager.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.137
- What, are they all the same?
- Yeah.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.505
( phone ringing )

41:13.539 --> 41:15.641
Hold on.

41:15.674 --> 41:16.842
Eppes.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.109
Uh-huh.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.679
Okay. Thanks for the heads up.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.848
The judge just approved Galway's
request to leave the country.

41:26.251 --> 41:29.755
( sirens blaring )

41:29.788 --> 41:32.691
( tires squealing )

41:37.996 --> 41:39.598
MAN:
Get your hands on the car!

41:39.631 --> 41:41.900
Hands on the car!
Out of the car! Out of the car!

41:41.933 --> 41:42.868
- Driver
- All right.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.069
Grab a piece of the car!

41:44.102 --> 41:45.671
Whoa!

41:45.704 --> 41:46.838
We cleared this through
the appropriate channels.

41:46.872 --> 41:47.973
You have no
right to detain

41:48.006 --> 41:49.007
Mr. Galway.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.208
Actually, it's Junior I'm after.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.943
We only have a warrant
for him, for now.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.111
You represent him, too?

41:53.144 --> 41:53.779
What are the charges?

41:53.812 --> 41:54.880
The murder of Lucinda Shay.

41:54.913 --> 41:55.781
That's just for starters.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.549
Go ahead, Malcolm,

41:57.583 --> 41:58.183
take your moment,
tell your dad.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.718
What is he talking about?

41:59.751 --> 42:00.518
MEGAN:
He moved

42:00.552 --> 42:02.020
$300 million
through one of your

42:02.053 --> 42:03.188
offshore trading accounts.

42:03.221 --> 42:04.823
And then he offered a scam

42:04.856 --> 42:05.757
to cover his tracks.

42:05.791 --> 42:06.825
DAVID:
It's probably

42:06.858 --> 42:07.859
what brought Syntel down.

42:09.928 --> 42:10.829
Is that true?

42:10.862 --> 42:13.765
Look, I was, I was a
Baker Scholar, Dad,

42:13.799 --> 42:14.900
at Harvard.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.802
You put me on a trading desk.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.003
I wanted you to
learn the business.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.873
Learn the business? You-you were
taking nickels and dimes.

42:21.907 --> 42:24.710
I-I earned $300 million, Dad.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.978
MEGAN: So, you orphaned a little
boy and

42:27.012 --> 42:28.246
6,000 people lost their jobs,

42:28.279 --> 42:29.915
so you could prove
that you were a bigger thief

42:29.948 --> 42:31.583
than your father.

42:31.617 --> 42:32.884
You're a bigger something.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.853
Let's go, Junior.

42:36.755 --> 42:37.155
Hey, Malcolm?

42:38.189 --> 42:38.924
Is that your car?

42:42.761 --> 42:43.895
Uh-huh.

42:58.343 --> 42:59.577
DON: Whoa, hey, I almost forgot.

42:59.611 --> 43:03.749
Now, look, we don't give these
to a lot of people, all right?

43:03.782 --> 43:05.617
So, you're one of us now.

43:05.651 --> 43:07.118
Okay, partner?

43:07.152 --> 43:09.655
Call me whenever you want.

43:09.688 --> 43:11.723
And your grandmother's going
to be waiting for you

43:11.757 --> 43:14.225
when you get to the airport, so
you got nothing to worry about.

43:14.259 --> 43:15.861
All right?

43:15.894 --> 43:16.194
Um...

43:17.996 --> 43:19.965
It's okay to cry about your mom.

43:19.998 --> 43:21.900
I mean,

43:21.933 --> 43:24.335
if you never did.

43:29.941 --> 43:30.776
Thanks.

43:33.378 --> 43:34.880
Come on. You don't want
to miss your flight now, do you?

43:36.447 --> 43:37.949
Come on.

43:41.987 --> 43:43.955
All right, buddy.

43:43.989 --> 43:45.957
Good man.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.961
Thanks very much.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.897
Take it easy.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.241
( laughing ):
What?

44:03.274 --> 44:06.044
My hope for grandchildren
has been rekindled.

44:06.077 --> 44:07.746
- Oh, don't start that.
- I'm not making

44:07.779 --> 44:10.281
a formal request, I'm simply
saying it would be nice.

44:10.315 --> 44:11.549
Come on.

44:11.582 --> 44:14.085
Dad, you do realize how long the
odds actually are for this man?

44:14.119 --> 44:16.087
Charlie, what's
your problem, huh?

44:16.121 --> 44:17.188
Well, given your dating pattern

44:17.222 --> 44:18.423
or absence
of any dating pattern...

44:18.456 --> 44:19.390
Look, I wouldn't talk
if I were you, buddy.

44:19.424 --> 44:21.927
- I'm crunching numbers, kid.
- Oh, yeah.

44:21.960 --> 44:22.928
Statistically, I'm on course

44:22.961 --> 44:24.062
to be way ahead of you.

44:24.095 --> 44:24.930
Yeah, yeah.

44:24.963 --> 44:25.731
Yeah, that makes sense,
you're older.

44:25.764 --> 44:26.364
All right, enough.
Hey, keep it up.

44:26.397 --> 44:28.734
It's a long
walk home.
