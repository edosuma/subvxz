(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:06.760 --> 01:08.592
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:09.000 --> 01:11.959
Breathe slowly, son.
Well done, that's it.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.235
Well done.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.556
I'm alive.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
We are alive, right?

01:20.720 --> 01:22.200
As far as I can tell, yeah.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.351
(GROANS)

01:27.320 --> 01:28.390
Where are we?

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
On a spaceship.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.593
WOMAN: My spaceship.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.320
Who's that?

01:34.400 --> 01:35.880
She says she's the pilot.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.110
We were in space.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.916
No way.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.557
We were in that warehouse and then,
we were in space.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.677
- Yeah.
- How were we in space?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.754
- I've got no idea.
- And why are we not in space now?

01:50.720 --> 01:54.794
I scooped you.
That was a very sneaky trick of his.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.837
Especially coming out of hyperjump.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.354
And you could've been killed.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.430
Listen, I keep telling you,

02:02.520 --> 02:04.591
we haven't got a clue
what you're talking about.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.195
Oh, have it your own way.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.755
Where in space are we?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.400
Just off the Final Planet,
which is out of orbit.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.639
Not where it should be.
But I still found it.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.080
What do you mean, "final planet"?
How can a planet be final?

02:21.160 --> 02:25.074
(CHUCKLING) You are
a very funny little bonus.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.350
Where's Yaz and the Doctor?

02:28.440 --> 02:31.080
- Are they here?
- No, I don't know where they are.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.096
I've been trying to get her
to look for them.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.918
I said there was four of us.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.117
And I said I only saw the two of you.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.432
I mean things were moving pretty fast,
speaking of which...

02:41.200 --> 02:43.510
Landing ahead.
Lock yourselves back in.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.230
We're not doing anything,

02:46.040 --> 02:48.874
unless you turn this thing around
and go and look for our friends.

02:48.960 --> 02:49.960
There'd be no point.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.952
If they were still there,
they'd be dead.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.110
They can't be dead.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.234
Don't panic. We'll figure it out.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.036
How? What happened to them?

03:01.400 --> 03:03.710
- (DOCTOR SHOUTING)
- (WHOOSHING)

03:03.800 --> 03:06.110
- (BEEPING)
- MAN: Stop insulting my ship.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.536
- This is one of the best crafts around!
- DOCTOR: I'd hate to see the others!

03:08.560 --> 03:10.711
MAN: I don't need your help.
DOCTOR: Yes you do.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.712
The power's failing
across three sections.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.678
This ship is on the verge
of total shutdown.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.598
How can a planet be in the wrong place?

03:16.680 --> 03:18.990
It should've been back there
where I scooped you up.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.113
We should be
in its gravity belt by now.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.113
- Well, we're not.
- I can see that.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.874
Hi. I can smell burning.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.913
You were right. She is still alive.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.798
Yaz, you need to stay locked
in the medipod.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.349
- Where's Ryan and Graham?
- There! The planet's there.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.800
How can it be there?

03:37.040 --> 03:38.110
Does it even have a name?

03:38.200 --> 03:41.830
Only a symbol. Or a warning.
Closest word is...

03:43.600 --> 03:44.716
Desolation.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.235
Right.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.596
I can do this.
I'm not going to be beaten. Move!

03:50.640 --> 03:52.240
I've still got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.119
DOCTOR: Manual shield activation?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.477
Wow, this thing should be on
<i>Antiques Roadshow.</i>

03:57.560 --> 03:58.994
Right! Blast shield's up.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.816
Don't know how long
they'll last for though.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.736
Brilliant! We're about to crash-land on
Desolation. Real grounds for optimism.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.753
Do you not understand anything?
I can't even get us there.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.434
Because of the fuel I wasted...

04:08.680 --> 04:10.637
Because of the fuel I've wasted
scooping you up.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.594
I'm on a spaceship. Okay.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.310
I can get us into the atmosphere.
If we jettison the rear section.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.995
Listen to me.
Nobody is jettisoning anything.

04:20.079 --> 04:23.232
This is the Cerebos. All right?
She's the envy of millions.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.910
- Really?
- Yes.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.440
People have written songs about her.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.256
They'll be writing operas
about our pointless deaths

04:28.280 --> 04:30.317
if we don't take drastic action
right now.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.310
We're about to die?

04:32.400 --> 04:34.756
Oh, sorry, Yaz. I forgot you were there.
All gonna be fine.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.751
Five systems down!
Six minutes left on life support.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.274
Are we doing this or what?

04:43.080 --> 04:44.080
Oh, Rekk!

04:46.240 --> 04:47.356
Let's do it.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.634
Last stage anyway.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
- Catch.
- Ah!

04:53.320 --> 04:55.160
- And you.
- YASMIN: What's actually happening?

04:55.280 --> 04:56.456
DOCTOR: No need to panic, Yaz.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.440
We're just gonna blow the back
off this spaceship.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.393
- What?
- Jettisoning.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.597
- Do it.
- (RUMBLING)

05:04.000 --> 05:05.036
(MAN SCREAMING)

05:23.840 --> 05:25.877
RYAN: Whoa.
GRAHAM: I couldn't have put it better.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.236
RYAN: Hey!

05:28.160 --> 05:29.355
Where are you going?

05:29.640 --> 05:31.711
I need to survey the atmospheric data.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.352
- We're on an alien planet, Graham.
- Yeah.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.434
Well, the three suns in the sky
are a bit of a giveaway.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
Uh-huh.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.150
What do we do?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.276
Should we just follow her?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
Yeah.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.516
Maybe they're already here.
Yaz and the Doctor.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
Maybe they're safe.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.478
All systems offline.
We're not gonna make it.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.313
Extra hand here.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.154
You can be honest with me.
Are we gonna die?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.870
One day, yes, comes to us all.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.074
But not right now.
Not if I've got anything to do with it.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.160
(MAN GRUNTING)

06:07.240 --> 06:09.120
This ship is old school.
I'm good at old school.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.632
Manual stabilisers.
Pull these two levers up,

06:13.920 --> 06:15.280
they'll pull down and to the left,

06:15.360 --> 06:17.750
pull them up and to the right
as strong as you can.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.840
Got it.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.960
That descent pattern won't work.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.431
We're about to die
and you're still having a go?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.040
Think you could do better?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.400
Yes!

06:29.680 --> 06:32.639
YASMIN: Doctor, these stabiliser
handles don't feel very stable.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.713
By the way, level-3 shield hazing.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.314
What? Seriously?

06:38.240 --> 06:41.438
Power failure.
We're headed into the gravity belt.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.360
Love, whoever you think we are,
we're not, all right?

06:45.520 --> 06:47.273
Are you still pleading ignorance?

06:48.160 --> 06:49.355
Do you guys hear that?

06:50.160 --> 06:53.039
Finskad! How did he even make it?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.194
It's another spaceship.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.158
Another spaceship about to crash-land.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.590
Oh!

06:58.840 --> 07:01.719
Don't just stand there. Run!

07:04.560 --> 07:06.916
It's coming. Run, run, run.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.720
(RYAN GRUNTS)

07:15.760 --> 07:17.240
(WIND HOWLING)

07:20.560 --> 07:21.835
Brace!

07:26.360 --> 07:27.680
(CRASHING)

07:34.360 --> 07:36.591
- RYAN: Doctor.
- Sorry about the mess.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.840
RYAN: Yaz, you're alive!

07:39.000 --> 07:40.116
We thought you were dead.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.429
We thought you were dead.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.750
Right. Quick update.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.597
I made a terrible mistake,
we shouldn't be here.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.876
I'm going to fix it
and get you guys home.

07:47.960 --> 07:48.960
I promise.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.440
- As soon I figure out where we are.
- How are you gonna do that?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.360
Not sure. Treating it as a chance
to surprise myself.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.919
Oh, by the way.
Welcome to what I presume

07:58.000 --> 08:00.196
is your first alien planet.
Don't touch anything.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.960
Come on, let's try this way.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.319
Look at you, Epzo.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.716
So you can't even control your own ship
now? You nearly killed us.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.792
Yeah, well I'll try harder
next time, eh?

08:12.320 --> 08:15.040
- Where's Kornlite and Fythen?
- Failed hyperjump.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.396
Both of them.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.236
It's just you and me left.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.435
You're kidding me.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.039
You have got so lucky.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.916
How did you even make it
this far, Angstrom, eh?

08:28.720 --> 08:29.915
You're nothing.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.395
Still, makes the next bit easy.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.597
(CHUCKLING) You would really love that,
wouldn't you?

08:38.520 --> 08:41.399
But I've got two bonuses. Same as you.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.919
(ALARM SOUNDING)

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
What's that?

08:44.080 --> 08:45.309
ANGSTROM: Here we go.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.352
DOCTOR: What do you mean, here we go?

08:47.640 --> 08:49.632
Here we go where? To what?

08:49.720 --> 08:51.518
RYAN: Yeah, where are we actually going?

08:51.600 --> 08:55.196
DOCTOR: Come on. Oh, I forgot
I put stuff in these pockets.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.469
GRAHAM: All this sand
is getting in my eyes something rotten.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
Want to borrow my shades?

09:04.960 --> 09:07.270
- Oh, ta!
- Like an old pair of mine.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.273
I say mine - can't remember
who I borrowed them off now.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.716
It was either Audrey Hepburn
or Pythagoras.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.553
Eh? Pythagoras never wore shades.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.036
Obviously never saw him with a hangover.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.513
Do you two know what that is?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.316
It's a tent.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.553
(TUTS) Obviously it's a tent.
I meant... Oh, never mind.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.154
Come on. No dawdling.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.070
Losers first.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.360
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

10:01.280 --> 10:04.239
Be careful.
I don't know what's going on.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.676
Could be dangerous.
Well, probably is dangerous.

10:07.560 --> 10:11.520
Can I ask if we are on an alien planet,
with aliens,

10:11.840 --> 10:13.957
how can we understand them?
Ain't they talking alien?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.072
Let's have a look. Yeah. Medipods
have put implants into each of you.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.834
Standard procedure.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.517
Checks for a universal translator.
Implants one if you don't have one.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.280
Eh? Well, can people and things

10:26.360 --> 10:28.397
stop putting stuff inside me
without my permission!

10:28.480 --> 10:30.597
If I had my TARDIS,
you wouldn't need them.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.000
Anyway, shall we?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.190
DOCTOR: This is lavish for a tent.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.755
I'm the Doctor.
These are my new best friends.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.832
Ryan, Graham, and Yaz. Now...

10:57.040 --> 10:58.360
(BUZZING)

10:58.440 --> 11:02.150
Ah, see. Hologram.
Thought it might be. Good one though.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.072
I love a good hologram.
I was a hologram once.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.278
For three weeks. The gossip I picked up.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.798
What are you?
Projection reality or AI interface?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.480
'Cause if you're interface,

11:12.360 --> 11:14.397
those are excellent nose hairs.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.950
Who are these people?

11:16.040 --> 11:17.474
- Bonuses.
- No.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.560
- What?
- I told you.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.713
Bonuses and snaketraps are over.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.736
They were hanging in the starfield
when we exited hyper.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.256
Are you saying
we scooped them for nothing?

11:25.280 --> 11:26.280
Yes.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.680
I sacrificed my ship.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.752
Yeah, sorry, some of this is my fault.

11:29.840 --> 11:33.390
Hi, we were loads of solar systems away,
I was trying to find my own ship,

11:33.480 --> 11:34.800
I got a fix on it here,

11:35.600 --> 11:37.557
and then it all went
quite badly wrong actually.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.996
These three have been very good
not going on about it.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.560
Very grateful you came along.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.632
Can I ask what is actually
going on here?

11:43.720 --> 11:46.040
- 'Cause I'm confused. Are you confused?
- Pretty confused.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.311
- Proper confused.
- I'm way beyond confused.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.637
You are intruding on the final stage

11:50.720 --> 11:52.520
of the last ever
Rally Of The Twelve Galaxies.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.159
What, like, a race?

11:54.240 --> 11:57.677
Like Paris-Dhakar in space?
Are you two space-racing each other?

11:57.760 --> 11:58.760
We are the finalists.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.797
Four thousand entered. Two are left.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.553
Only one will claim the prize.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.912
- What's the prize?
- For the final ever race,

12:05.560 --> 12:07.597
three point two trillion krin.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.433
- Three point two trillion what?
- Krin.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.715
How much is a krin?

12:10.800 --> 12:12.678
- Two hundred kavlons.
- Ninety forvelars.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.558
- No.
- Four thousand trynties.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.109
- Oh, in old money.
- I'm a bit behind on my exchange rates,

12:17.200 --> 12:21.797
Enough to provide a lifetime
of comfort on a safe world

12:21.880 --> 12:24.076
for the winning pilot
and their entire clan.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.913
- Are we eligible too?
- No.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.240
You're irrelevant. Get on with it.
Tell us the task.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.754
Final challenge
is to cross the terrain,

12:33.120 --> 12:34.440
survive the planet.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.071
Make your way to the other side
of the mountains,

12:37.160 --> 12:39.516
and the first one
to get to the site marked

12:39.600 --> 12:42.559
as the Ghost Monument
will be crowned the winner.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.313
And transported off this planet.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.076
The loser will not.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.916
You can't leave one of us here.
The ships are out of fuel.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.834
Don't tell me what I can and cannot do
with my own race.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.037
You knew the risks when you joined.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.634
Biggest ever prize. Biggest ever risk.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.119
Wait. Hang on. What about us?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.751
Shut up. You're not part of this.

13:09.320 --> 13:13.109
Excuse me. We are human beings.
Show a bit of solidarity.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.711
I'm Muxteran, she's Albarian.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.872
Never even heard of Moomanbeans.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.350
Beings. Human beings. Earth.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.318
- No.
- Pretty cruel race.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.280
Leaving the loser stranded.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.720
The Rally is a test of survival.
How far will we go?

13:29.160 --> 13:32.756
How will we react when challenged?
It's the ultimate test.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.998
Interesting use of the word "we".
Seeing as though you're not here.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.712
Projected in from a very long way away.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.319
I started the Rally.
I competed, and I won.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.720
And now I'm going to end it.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.960
No sabotage, no injuries,
no killing each other.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.076
Shame.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.720
Instant disqualification applies.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.034
Now take your meds.
Don't travel at night.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.079
And don't drink the water.
In fact, don't even touch the water.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.590
This entire planet has been made cruel.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.876
Made cruel how? And by whom?

14:09.360 --> 14:11.238
This stage must be completed

14:11.920 --> 14:14.594
before one full solo rotation.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.514
You have one single piece of assistance.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.916
Transport. Provided by the water.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.355
Get across the water, through the ruins,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.710
and the site of the Ghost Monument
is on the other side of the mist swamps.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
Mist what?

14:30.880 --> 14:33.839
Your route trackers are over there.
Good luck.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.516
I know you prefer to ignore me,
but what is it? This Ghost Monument?

14:37.760 --> 14:39.991
The site was named
by the ancient settlers.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.917
It appears in exactly the same place
every thousand rotations.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.755
I've got my tracker. I'm good to go.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.400
See you for the prize, Ilin.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.269
Finally get to light my Althusian cigar.
Saving it for the win.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.111
What does it look like? This monument?

14:57.400 --> 14:59.835
- What does it matter?
- Look at us.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.238
Four people who barely know each other,

15:02.320 --> 15:05.552
stranded on a planet called Desolation,
no route trackers,

15:05.640 --> 15:07.680
no way off, and judging by
what you've just told us,

15:07.720 --> 15:10.599
very little hope of survival.
I need all the information I can get.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.752
Including, but not limited to,

15:12.840 --> 15:16.151
what this Ghost Monument
actually looks like when it appears.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.280
- That's an old police box.
- Yeah.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.399
Yeah, like the one on Surrey Street.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.994
Only the one in town's green.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.350
This don't make any sense.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.879
It makes sense to me.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.157
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.716
That'll do.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.951
Well, I'm sorry
I can't be of any more help.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.790
I don't think you are.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.556
You're right.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.789
Oh, bye, then.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.195
He was a bit full of himself.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.520
I've got a couple of questions.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.353
A couple? I got a book full.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.176
But shouldn't we keep with up
with those two

15:58.200 --> 15:59.429
before they get too far away?

15:59.520 --> 16:00.520
Yes.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.960
Now I know this is a bit of a shock.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.520
Well, you could say that.
I mean, we have been dumped in space.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.353
We got spaceships
crashing all around us.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.159
Now we are marooned on a planet

16:09.240 --> 16:11.152
that everyone else is racing
to get away from.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.038
All right.
Anyone can focus on the negatives.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.176
Well, what are the positives?

16:14.200 --> 16:18.592
What he called the Ghost Monument,
that's my ship. It's here.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.871
- What, the old police box?
- Didn't look all that.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.679
Its very "all that",
thank you very much.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.070
Don't you see, I got it mostly right.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.076
I tracked my TARDIS here,
but the planet had fallen out of orbit.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.391
We landed
where the planet should've been.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.196
It looks like the engines
are stuck in a loop.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.597
Phasing in and out of time and space.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.512
If we get to it when it phases in,

16:40.120 --> 16:42.999
I should be able to stabilise it,
then I can get you back home

16:43.080 --> 16:44.150
Definitely?

16:44.240 --> 16:46.436
If we get there,
you can get us off this planet alive?

16:46.520 --> 16:50.673
Yaz, I promise. I will keep you alive.
And I will get you back home.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.554
I'm really good in a tight spot.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.839
At least I have been historically.
I'm sure I still am.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.796
If we stick together, if you trust me,
we can get out of this.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.951
Right. Let's get a shift on.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.520
RYAN: Do you think
she's telling the truth?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.157
Do you really think
she can get us off here?

17:12.119 --> 17:15.079
YASMIN: She saved Karl.
She got the better of Tim Shaw.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.954
And she did jump a crane.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.976
Don't know what would've happened
if she hadn't have been there.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.799
Yaz is right.
I mean, she's our best hope,

17:23.119 --> 17:25.112
or only option
depending on your politics.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.640
Guess so.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.469
Don't argue with the wisdom
of Graham, eh?

17:30.360 --> 17:32.560
So we're sticking with Graham, are we,
and not Granddad?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.516
Yes, Graham.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.832
EPZO: I said, stay away from the boat.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.520
ANGSTROM: You don't get this
to yourself.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.710
This blaster says I do.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.634
Put the blaster down.
We all know you're not gonna use it.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.360
No injuring, no killing, no sabotage.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.392
Isn't that what What-his-face said?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.437
Yeah, well,
maybe I don't play by the rules.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.439
Did you practise
those lines in the mirror?

17:53.160 --> 17:55.152
- See this?
- (GASPS)

17:55.440 --> 17:57.159
- Nice move.
- Thanks.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.359
Venusian Aikido.
Grand Master Pacifist.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.154
Temporarily paralyses,

18:02.240 --> 18:04.277
while also being fundamentally harmless.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.114
Very clever, those Venusian nuns.
Shall I let go?

18:07.960 --> 18:09.917
(GASPING AND COUGHING)

18:10.000 --> 18:11.480
ANGSTROM: And this boat doesn't work.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.315
- Oh, me and Ryan will take a look.
- Will we?

18:14.640 --> 18:16.791
Well, those NVQ classes
must be good for something.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.712
- An engine's an engine.
- Not a space engine.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.594
You don't get to take charge here.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.518
This is about me
and her fighting to win.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.600
We're all going to the same place and
that boat is big enough for all of us.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.439
Yaz is right. If we get it started,
we all get onboard.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.792
Yeah, I know what this is.
You are all part of Ilin's game.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.871
Saboteurs. Sent to throw us off.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.271
You think the whole universe
is out to get you.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.200
How's your family, Angstrom?

18:46.040 --> 18:47.918
So that's why he said
don't touch the water.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.713
Flesh eating microbes.
Millions of them living in there.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.431
Toxic atmosphere. Killer water.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.960
Very dangerous planet, Yaz.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.473
You were right.
Not like any engine I've ever seen.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.554
We ever gonna talk about your nan?

19:16.360 --> 19:18.556
I mean, just because all this
is going on,

19:18.640 --> 19:20.040
don't mean to say it didn't happen.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.993
See, I cope myself

19:23.400 --> 19:25.869
by asking the question "If Grace
was here what would she say?"

19:30.160 --> 19:31.276
What do you reckon?

19:32.120 --> 19:34.715
Well, right now she'd be going,
"What's the matter with you?

19:35.120 --> 19:36.880
"You're on another planet.
How cool is that?"

19:39.160 --> 19:40.276
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.160
And it is. Right?

19:44.520 --> 19:47.274
- I'm gonna look out for you, son.
- I'm not a kid.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.070
Well, okay.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.673
Well, I was hoping you'd say,
"I'm gonna look out for you, too".

19:55.240 --> 19:57.960
- You talk about this stuff way too much.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.033
And you don't talk about it enough.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.753
That's not an engine.
That's more like a massive battery.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.071
- What if it's solar?
- Look at you boys.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.951
Light years from home.
Figuring things out.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.312
Yep, three suns in the sky.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.318
Tri-solar engineering panels
on the outside powering that battery.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.195
Well, if it won't start,
maybe the panels aren't lined up.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.560
Or maybe they're not feeding
the battery properly.

20:29.880 --> 20:30.996
Loving your work, boys.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.755
Let's take a look.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.919
I've never seen so much water.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.794
You're Albarian, he said?

20:39.760 --> 20:42.320
Yes, the planet of Albar.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.319
It's tiny.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.392
Crammed full of rusting high-rises.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.432
Everyone wants to leave
any way they can. Even more so since...

20:53.240 --> 20:54.310
Since what?

20:57.320 --> 20:58.640
I don't know you.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.516
Up and running. All aboard.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.949
Hey, Yaz, can you believe it?

21:10.720 --> 21:12.154
Alien planet, man.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.870
I know.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.793
This planet doesn't make any sense.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.349
No other life forms except us
and the microbes in the water.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.831
No people, no animals,
no insects, no nothing.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.438
But he talked about the old settlements.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.990
What happened here?

21:26.520 --> 21:27.670
No one cares.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.280
ANGSTROM: Don't take him personally.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.475
He treats everyone like this.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.480
I don't need other people.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.440
We all need other people, mate.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.990
We're all alone.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.673
That's how we start and end.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.991
And it's the natural state
of all points in between.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.440
Were you born that miserable?
Or did you have to work at it?

21:48.480 --> 21:49.675
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

21:53.040 --> 21:56.795
You know, when I was four,
my mum told me to climb a tree.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.960
She made me climb until I was too scared
to climb any higher.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.110
Then she told me to jump into her arms.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.554
"Don't worry," she said. "I'm your mum.
I'm here for you. I'll catch you."

22:10.760 --> 22:11.955
So I jumped.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.349
And she moved out of the way.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.156
What?

22:18.040 --> 22:20.350
Sorry.
Did you say your mum did this to you?

22:21.080 --> 22:22.196
Smashed into the ground.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.716
Broke this arm. Shattered that ankle.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.960
And she stood over me, and she said,
"Now, you've learned.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.916
"You can never trust anyone
in this life."

22:33.800 --> 22:34.916
That is messed up.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.275
Best thing she ever did for me.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.670
I loved my mum.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.274
Yeah, she sounds terrific.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.480
Your mum was wrong.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.750
We're stronger together.

22:59.480 --> 23:02.757
I see your mate's dropped off.
It's nice to see him quiet.

23:02.880 --> 23:03.950
Yeah.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.997
He can nap anywhere. Famous for it.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.120
How many stages are there in the rally?

23:09.360 --> 23:13.240
This time? 209 terrains, 94 planets.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.554
We start the race with nothing
and barter our way up.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
Is it worth it?

23:18.120 --> 23:21.557
To ensure enough
for my family's safety? Yeah.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.956
Albar is being systematically cleansed.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.638
Half my family are in hiding.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.994
The others are on the run.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.398
This is my only chance
to bring us back together.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.153
So you left your family to do this?

23:38.280 --> 23:41.000
I left my family
to try and save my family.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.150
They told me to.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.036
If I win, I find them.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.195
Rescue them.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.995
If they're alive to be rescued.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.156
And whatever happens here,

23:54.720 --> 23:56.916
it's a better chance
than I have back home.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.400
You're making me miss my family.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.914
That's quite some achievement.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.440
Considering my dad drives me bananas,

24:03.520 --> 24:06.360
and my sister's trying to get me
to move out so she can have my bedroom.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.880
And I only saw them yesterday.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.592
Don't ever take them for granted.

24:16.760 --> 24:18.433
Oh, you all look shattered.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.796
You should all rest.
I'll wake you when we get there.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.796
Ryan.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.513
Ryan. Wake up, son.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.191
I'm awake. I'm awake.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.875
Are we home?

24:48.960 --> 24:51.191
No. Time to get off the boat. Come on.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.711
ANGSTROM: Have you seen yourself, Epzo?

24:57.160 --> 25:01.393
I'd say you love that cigar
more than you've loved any person.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.837
Have you any idea how rare
and expensive these are?

25:05.840 --> 25:08.639
Takes half an Althusian lifetime
to make just one of these.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.832
To make them, roll them,

25:11.440 --> 25:13.318
age them, and then,
and this is the best bit,

25:14.200 --> 25:15.680
they make them self-lighting.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.919
Just one click of the finger

25:18.000 --> 25:19.673
and it lights itself.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.680
You want a sniff?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.160
Closest you'll ever get to victory.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.754
It's bad for your health.

DOCTOR: Wonder who those were built for.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.076
EPZO: Why do you even care?

25:32.680 --> 25:33.909
Where are those people now?

25:35.240 --> 25:38.711
And why are there so few signs of life?
What happened to everyone?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Bye.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.555
Good luck.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.680
EPZO: You're already lost, Angstrom.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.296
GRAHAM: What, we're just
letting them go, are we?

25:47.320 --> 25:48.913
How do we know what to do? Where to go?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.794
First thing we have to do is make it
through those ruins safely.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.640
Because these readings are all over
the place and I don't know why.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.955
They're moving
way faster than I realised.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.750
Well, back in the tent that bloke Ilin
said, "Do not travel by night."

26:32.840 --> 26:34.752
We need to move. Fast.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.736
GRAHAM: Whoa! They weren't there
when we came in.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.080
RYAN: Where did they come from?

26:41.160 --> 26:42.230

26:43.040 --> 26:44.315
YASMIN: Oh, my God! Doctor!

26:45.200 --> 26:47.351
So much for no life forms
on this planet.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.194
They're not alive. They're robot guards.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.870
Why would you need robot guards
on a deserted planet?

26:58.880 --> 27:00.599
Good news is they're not fully active.

27:00.720 --> 27:05.272
So what we all need to do is
very slowly, totally unthreateningly,

27:05.720 --> 27:07.393
back out of here.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.070

27:20.400 --> 27:22.995
Don't run straight.
They're predicting your path.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.276
Move! In here.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.992
Well done, all of you. Nice running.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.360
(GASPS) Oh! Okay. Come on.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.393
Oh! What have we here?

27:50.640 --> 27:52.360
YASMIN: Have you got
anything there, Doctor?

27:53.200 --> 27:55.874
Information. Oh! That's bad.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.509
They're SniperBots.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.076
We just walked
into the middle of the shooting range.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.795
Everything within the perimeter
is target practice.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.078
Which would explain
all the targets in here.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.594
And looking on the negative side,

28:09.920 --> 28:11.149
they're human-shaped targets.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.711
If that's the way it is,
time to stop messing about.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.320
- What are you doing?
- Fighting back.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.636
No. Guns, never use them.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.056
- They're shooting at us.
- I know.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.336
They're gonna kill us with their guns.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.396
He's got a point, Doc.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.751
- Put the gun down, Ryan.
- What's your better idea?

28:24.160 --> 28:26.197
- Out-think them.
- You can't out-think bullets.

they're powerful.

emanate from.
