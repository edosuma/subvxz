01:10.297 --> 01:12.299
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

01:13.508 --> 01:14.342
Why?

01:14.551 --> 01:16.136
It's time for Sunday brunch!

01:16.344 --> 01:19.556
Oh, come back
when it's time for Sunday dinner.

01:23.059 --> 01:25.687
But Mom made
her famous blueberry pancakes.

01:25.896 --> 01:30.567
And she used duck eggs for more nutrition
and a deeper flavor profile.

01:32.903 --> 01:35.113
What? I like my cooking shows.

01:35.990 --> 01:37.908
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

01:37.992 --> 01:39.409
- Come on!
- No.

01:39.493 --> 01:40.786
Come on!

01:41.411 --> 01:42.454
Here, Tommy.

01:42.537 --> 01:46.583
Enjoy your breakfast bottle,
the most important bottle of the day.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.716
- Morning, Mom.
- There he is!

01:54.800 --> 01:59.179
My beautiful firstborn baby boy.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.306
Have a seat right at the head of the table

02:01.389 --> 02:03.809
and while you wait
for your favorite pancakes,

02:04.018 --> 02:06.770
enjoy a pre-breakfast milkshake.

02:08.856 --> 02:11.149
- You're being weird.
- I'm not being weird.

02:11.232 --> 02:15.195
Can't a mom make her beautiful
firstborn son a pre-breakfast milkshake?

02:16.822 --> 02:18.198
Okay, that was kind of weird.

02:19.867 --> 02:22.619
- Can I have some hot fudge on my pancakes?
- Sure, honey.

02:22.828 --> 02:24.329
Okay, you're up to something.

02:26.540 --> 02:31.127
I got her up.
Aunt Stephanie is not a morning person.

02:33.839 --> 02:37.676
No. No, Aunt Stephanie is a night person.

02:38.927 --> 02:42.222
You know, when the clubs are going off,
bottles are popping,

02:42.305 --> 02:43.557
people are hooking up...

02:43.640 --> 02:45.225
[clears throat loudly]

02:46.393 --> 02:48.603
...their Xboxes.

02:49.437 --> 02:53.191
- Aunt Steph, let's go get some juice.
- I don't want any juice.

02:54.651 --> 02:57.237
Then help me pick out my juice.

02:58.989 --> 03:01.199
She's such a good juice picker-outer.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.208
[whispers] I still haven't told the boys
Kimmy and Ramona are moving in today.

03:10.876 --> 03:12.127
Chicken.

03:12.210 --> 03:16.798
- Okay, I'm a little chicken.
- No, I'm talking about the fried chicken.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.887
The boys have been through so many changes
and now here comes another one,

03:21.970 --> 03:24.431
and I just don't know
how they're going to react.

03:24.514 --> 03:29.019
So don't say a word until
I find the right moment to break the news.

03:29.103 --> 03:30.270
Sorry,

03:30.353 --> 03:31.563
I spilled the beans.

03:32.230 --> 03:33.565
You told them?

03:33.648 --> 03:36.777
No, I spilled the beans
when I was reaching for the chicken.

03:39.237 --> 03:41.990
Mom, please don't make me do this.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.201
Moving in with D.J. and those boys
is a terrible idea.

03:45.410 --> 03:49.581
D.J. really needs us and you love her.
She's your godmother.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.583
Really? I have a godmother?

03:53.501 --> 03:55.545
So, like, three wishes?

03:56.421 --> 03:58.632
That's a fairy godmother.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.844
Do you really want me to change schools
and be the outcast loner kid,

04:02.928 --> 04:05.764
all to move in
with the whitest family in America?

04:07.265 --> 04:09.935
The Fullers are like albino polar bears

04:10.018 --> 04:12.312
drinking milk

04:12.520 --> 04:14.230
in a snowstorm,

04:14.314 --> 04:16.774
watching <i>Frozen.</i>

04:18.735 --> 04:20.070
That's pretty white.

04:25.117 --> 04:26.284
[speaks Spanish]

04:27.494 --> 04:30.789
[speaks Spanish]

04:32.582 --> 04:34.168
I am not going in there.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.295
There is nothing you can do
to make me walk inside that house.

04:39.173 --> 04:40.423
[stammers]

04:42.050 --> 04:43.135
<i>Ramona?</i>

04:44.052 --> 04:46.805
That was so evil.

04:48.849 --> 04:50.142
But extremely effective.

05:03.446 --> 05:05.573
Mom, just tell me what's going on.

05:05.657 --> 05:07.742
Um... Okay.

05:07.826 --> 05:10.996
You might think this is bad news,
but it really is good news,

05:11.079 --> 05:14.249
just hiding in not-so-great news.

05:14.457 --> 05:17.878
It's like cauliflower
filled with jellybeans.

05:19.713 --> 05:22.049
Come on, Mom. How bad can it be?

05:22.841 --> 05:25.177
I've waited my whole life to say this...

05:25.260 --> 05:27.179
home, sweet home.

05:33.894 --> 05:34.895
No.

05:36.146 --> 05:37.313
Yes.

05:37.939 --> 05:40.150
Come here, sister-wife.

05:44.196 --> 05:46.656
So, now you all know the good news.

05:46.865 --> 05:48.909
Kimmy and Ramona are here to help us out.

05:48.992 --> 05:51.245
And we really appreciate it,
don't we, boys?

05:51.452 --> 05:55.331
Works for me. The more people
to drive me around, the merrier.

05:56.917 --> 05:59.961
Jellybean-filled cauliflower my butt!

06:02.172 --> 06:03.006
[door slamming]

06:03.090 --> 06:05.633
Ooh, the mouth on that kid!

06:07.552 --> 06:09.763
Oh, I feel at home already.

06:13.934 --> 06:16.561
Oh, that's sweet.
You kept Ramona's turkey art?

06:16.770 --> 06:18.521
No, that's mine.

06:20.523 --> 06:24.278
This is so cool.
I'm living in Jesse and Becky's old room.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.446
I was never allowed up here before.

06:28.364 --> 06:31.201
I think Becky was always
a little jealous of me.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.370
Yeah, that was definitely the reason.

06:35.914 --> 06:38.292
This will be the new
international headquarters

06:38.374 --> 06:40.961
for Gibbler Style party planning.

06:41.628 --> 06:44.380
My Fathead will look great right here.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.599
Gotta love it!

06:57.560 --> 06:58.728
So where's my room?

06:58.812 --> 07:02.565
Oh, right through this door.
This is where Nicky and Alex used to live.

07:08.905 --> 07:10.824
What do you think? Pretty cozy.

07:11.491 --> 07:13.743
Were Nicky and Alex hobbits?

07:16.246 --> 07:18.165
Maybe I should go live with Papa.

07:18.832 --> 07:22.961
You know your papa is always on the road,
so you're stuck with your mama.

07:23.837 --> 07:26.714
Or you can give me a nice apartment
and I can raise myself.

07:26.798 --> 07:29.884
Ramona, do your homework.
Ramona, clean your room.

07:30.093 --> 07:32.095
Ramona, listen to Ramona.

07:32.179 --> 07:34.681
Wow, this mom thing is so easy.

07:35.974 --> 07:38.018
I got an idea from when I was a kid.

07:38.101 --> 07:41.229
This might work out great
for Jackson and Max, and for you.

07:41.313 --> 07:44.149
What if I have the boys share a room,

07:44.232 --> 07:47.319
and you could have
your own bedroom downstairs?

07:47.402 --> 07:50.071
Private, big closet...

07:50.280 --> 07:51.489
I'm listening.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.992
That was it.

07:55.869 --> 07:57.954
Or stay up here with me.

07:58.163 --> 07:59.331
It will be so much fun.

07:59.414 --> 08:02.209
We'll have mother-daughter
slumber parties every night.

08:03.459 --> 08:05.253
Let's go check out that other bedroom.

08:12.427 --> 08:14.304
Jackson, perfect timing.

08:14.971 --> 08:17.849
I baked your favorite... chocolate cake.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.517
Mom, Mom, Mom,

08:19.726 --> 08:23.688
if this is another bribe about Kimmy
and Ramona moving in, I'm cool.

08:23.897 --> 08:26.482
I can just go hide in my room.

08:28.735 --> 08:30.570
My boy cave.

08:31.571 --> 08:33.448
About your boy cave,

08:34.032 --> 08:35.991
there's something else I need to tell you.

08:36.076 --> 08:37.618
Well, it's really not bad news.

08:37.827 --> 08:39.537
I wouldn't say it's great news.

08:40.496 --> 08:42.457
I wouldn't say terrible.

08:42.539 --> 08:44.334
I wouldn't say wonderful.

08:44.959 --> 08:50.257
Jackson! Your room is under attack!
This is not a drill!

08:52.759 --> 08:55.095
Really got to work
on getting to the point.

08:55.887 --> 08:57.013
My stuff!

08:57.097 --> 08:59.724
Excuse me.
I found some blue and white paint.

08:59.933 --> 09:02.769
I want my room the same colors
as the flag of my people.

09:02.852 --> 09:04.520
[speaks Spanish]

09:06.314 --> 09:08.858
[sighs] You gave away my room?

09:09.609 --> 09:11.986
To give you a much bigger one.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.949
In fact, it's so big,

09:16.032 --> 09:19.202
there's enough room for you and Max.

09:19.411 --> 09:22.789
- Now I'm living with Max?
- I'm living with Jackson?

09:22.872 --> 09:26.418
This is the best day of my life!

09:30.588 --> 09:32.340
Okay, here's the game plan...

09:32.424 --> 09:34.550
Ramona is moving into Jackson's room,

09:34.634 --> 09:37.053
the baby is going into Max's old room,

09:37.262 --> 09:41.724
and the two of you are moving
across the hall into the...

09:42.850 --> 09:44.311
good room.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.398
Awesome! Give me a hug, roomie!

09:50.942 --> 09:52.444
Come on, Jackson.

09:52.527 --> 09:54.946
This will be a really good thing
for you and Max.

09:55.029 --> 09:59.033
- It will bring you closer together.
- How much closer can we be?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.911
Let's find out in the good room.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.585
Hey, that cake was for the boys.

10:10.128 --> 10:11.421
Hm? Oh.

10:11.505 --> 10:13.673
We know. We saved them each a slice.

10:15.091 --> 10:16.050
Ooh.

10:18.219 --> 10:20.388
[sighs] I've got some bad news.

10:20.596 --> 10:22.849
Great, another cake!

10:24.434 --> 10:27.395
As if today weren't crazy enough,
my boss just called.

10:27.479 --> 10:29.730
There's an emergency
down at the pet clinic.

10:29.814 --> 10:31.774
- I wish I didn't have to go...
- Fear not.

10:31.858 --> 10:35.653
This is exactly why Kimmy and I are here...
to make your life easier.

10:35.862 --> 10:39.282
- We are Team D.J.
- And Team D.J.'s got your back.

10:39.491 --> 10:43.537
Oh, thank you, guys, so much. I don't know
what I'd do if you weren't here.

10:44.162 --> 10:45.455
Team D.J. on three.

10:51.378 --> 10:53.547
- One, two...
- Well, hold on.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.049
Is it one, two,
and then we say "Team D.J." on three?

10:56.132 --> 10:58.385
Or is it one, two, three,
and then we say it?

11:01.095 --> 11:04.057
That would be going on four.
Nobody goes on four.

11:05.141 --> 11:06.684
What am I, Canadian?

11:07.477 --> 11:09.270
I'm going to let Team D.J. work this out.

11:09.354 --> 11:11.272
I've been putting up with you
for 25 years.

11:11.356 --> 11:13.941
- You have put up with me?
- Why can't you do simple math?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.152
It's moving day!

11:16.236 --> 11:19.322
I'm moving in with Jackson!
It's moving day!

11:19.531 --> 11:22.617
I'm moving in with Jackson!

11:22.825 --> 11:25.245
Ah, there's my favorite little brother.

11:25.328 --> 11:26.704
Oh, no offense, baldy.

11:28.831 --> 11:30.250
You're a smart kid, right?

11:30.458 --> 11:32.960
I've been told I'm very bright for my age.

11:34.504 --> 11:39.300
Well, then you understand
that you and me in the same room,

11:39.384 --> 11:40.801
it's never going to work.

11:41.010 --> 11:43.679
But Mom said living together
would bring us closer.

11:43.888 --> 11:45.640
Moms lie.

11:47.392 --> 11:50.645
Consider this...
in my room, I'm in charge of you,

11:50.853 --> 11:55.609
but in this room,
you are in charge of Tommy.

11:57.444 --> 12:00.447
- Don't you want to be The Man?
- Of course I do.

12:00.530 --> 12:04.367
I've wanted to be The Man
ever since I was The Baby.

12:05.701 --> 12:09.539
Well, then it's settled.
You're staying here. Knuckles.

12:15.295 --> 12:18.465
What is that nastiness?

12:20.007 --> 12:24.095
- Um, uh, I don't smell a thing.
- It's Tommy's diaper!

12:25.721 --> 12:29.183
No way am I living in this stinkatorium!

12:33.187 --> 12:37.567
Thanks a lot, kid.
I was this close. This close.

12:37.651 --> 12:39.235
[coughing]

12:44.157 --> 12:46.576
[upbeat music playing]

12:46.660 --> 12:48.161
I want my room back.

12:48.953 --> 12:54.875
Jaxito, moving here was my mom's idea,
not mine. So we're both victims.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.546
I'm just the victim
with the private bedroom.

12:58.630 --> 13:00.840
And have you seen the city view?

13:01.466 --> 13:03.843
Uh, yeah. I used to live here.

13:08.306 --> 13:09.307
Oh, hey, Jackson.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.686
Oh, hey, Aunt Steph.

13:14.479 --> 13:16.856
Here's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

13:17.064 --> 13:21.861
Imagine the thrill of sharing a room
with your adorable nephew, Max.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.280
I'm imagining it, okay?

13:24.364 --> 13:27.450
Now you imagine me saying,
"No, thank you."

13:29.619 --> 13:30.953
Hey, now.

13:39.420 --> 13:42.089
Hey. Aren't you driving down to LA
with your stuff?

13:42.173 --> 13:44.008
Isn't Becky waiting for you down there?

13:44.217 --> 13:46.761
Yeah, she is
but I forgot my lucky guitar, Priscilla.

13:46.844 --> 13:49.013
I left it here so I wouldn't forget it,
but forgot.

13:49.222 --> 13:51.725
I'm starting to think
this guitar is not so lucky.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.435
Uncle Jesse, you've got to help me.

13:54.519 --> 13:56.854
They want me to share a room
with a seven-year-old.

13:57.063 --> 13:59.482
I've got the fix.
You and Max, go hug it out.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.819
We already did that.
I just got him off of me.

14:04.571 --> 14:07.281
Well, you know, we used to hug it out
every day in the '80s.

14:08.616 --> 14:12.328
Sometimes it was so sweet,
you could hear violin music.

14:13.413 --> 14:15.707
- Uncle Jesse? I got this.
- You got chicken?

14:15.790 --> 14:17.542
- We got chicken.
- You got this.

14:19.252 --> 14:22.338
Jackson, when I was five,
my dad forced me to move in with D.J.,

14:22.422 --> 14:24.591
and then he gave my bedroom
to Uncle Jesse.

14:24.799 --> 14:28.052
But when I lived there it was
wall-to-wall with girly pink bunnies.

14:28.261 --> 14:30.846
You know, that could explain
my love for the theatre.

14:31.055 --> 14:32.973
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

14:33.182 --> 14:37.311
Anyway, D.J. was furious so she moved down
to the garage. Of course, she got caught.

14:37.395 --> 14:40.690
If she wanted her own room, she should
have run away, rented an apartment.

14:41.357 --> 14:43.150
- Would that have worked?
- I doubt it.

14:43.234 --> 14:45.069
At age ten,
her credit score was really low.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.946
[both laughing]

14:49.574 --> 14:50.866
But it all turned out fine

14:50.950 --> 14:54.161
because D.J. realized how lucky she was
to live with me.

14:54.245 --> 14:55.413
Do you get the lesson here?

14:55.580 --> 15:00.918
You know what? I do. I'm going to go
upstairs right now and bond with Max.

15:02.211 --> 15:04.213
Thanks, guys.

15:05.131 --> 15:08.593
Steph, you know, for your first aunt talk,
I think you crushed it.

15:08.676 --> 15:10.219
- I did, didn't I?
- You'd better.

15:10.303 --> 15:14.056
I gave you, like, 1,000 uncle talks,
except you forgot two important words.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.809
"Have mercy."

15:17.602 --> 15:19.562
No. "How rude."

15:21.230 --> 15:24.442
All right, Jesse has left the building.

15:25.985 --> 15:27.945
But first, Jesse has to pee.

15:32.283 --> 15:36.203
Diaper changing is simple.
Just remove, refresh and replace.

15:36.412 --> 15:39.332
Then wait for Tommy to reload.

15:41.125 --> 15:45.087
My friends are skiing in St. Moritz
right now, and I'm here changing diapers.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.881
Selfie.

15:48.842 --> 15:50.510
They're going to be so jealous.

15:51.260 --> 15:52.386
Okay, let's do this.

15:52.595 --> 15:54.514
Wait. I'm not ready.

15:57.975 --> 16:00.019
Unleash the Kraken!

16:01.354 --> 16:03.481
All right. Here we go.

16:04.315 --> 16:07.026
You know, I haven't done this
since Michelle was a baby.

16:07.861 --> 16:11.405
I changed so many of Michelle's diapers,
I feel like there were two of her.

16:14.742 --> 16:17.745
Here comes the tricky part.
Watch out for the fire hose!

16:17.829 --> 16:18.954
[Steph] Yes.

16:19.038 --> 16:22.458
Huh... Boom! Drop the mic.

16:23.877 --> 16:25.670
[phone ringing]

16:27.171 --> 16:28.214
Not me.

16:29.883 --> 16:31.300
[phone ringing]

16:31.509 --> 16:32.510
Uh-oh...

16:37.640 --> 16:39.141
Hello?

16:40.476 --> 16:42.770
- [D.J. over phone] <i>Stephanie?</i>
- Um, Deej...

16:42.978 --> 16:45.940
- Hey. What's up?
- [D.J.] <i>I'm just checking in.</i>

16:46.148 --> 16:49.485
- How is it going with Tommy?
- We've never been closer.

16:52.906 --> 16:53.740
[Tommy farting]

16:56.534 --> 16:57.744
What was that?

16:59.370 --> 17:01.539
Oh, you know, I'm playing <i>Angry Birds</i>

17:01.622 --> 17:02.623
and I just shot a duck.

17:05.166 --> 17:06.627
There's a duck in <i>Angry Birds?</i>

17:06.836 --> 17:08.212
It might have been a goose.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.298
Oh, look,
I'm getting a really important phone call.

17:11.507 --> 17:14.134
- From who?
- Not sure. It might be a butt dial.

17:14.218 --> 17:15.929
Okay, bye, Deej.

17:18.513 --> 17:19.682
Quick thinking.

17:19.766 --> 17:20.892
Well, gotta go.

17:22.268 --> 17:23.102
Me, too.

17:24.228 --> 17:26.355
Have fun getting that phone back.

Moving to LA with your favorite uncle.

18:10.733 --> 18:13.068
But if I'm in the truck,

18:23.621 --> 18:25.289
Is this about losing your bedroom?

18:25.498 --> 18:28.584
No, it's not just that.
I mean, it's everything.

18:28.668 --> 18:31.004
I used to live in a house full of guys.

18:31.086 --> 18:34.799
Now, there's women everywhere.
I'm outnumbered.

18:35.008 --> 18:38.970
Living with women, you'll learn valuable
lessons, like how to talk to them.

18:39.053 --> 18:41.430
Take Becky and her terrible cooking,
for instance.

18:41.514 --> 18:45.142
She makes this lasagna that tastes like...
What's the word...? Sweatpants.

18:46.602 --> 18:48.521
And I just keep feeding it to the dog

18:48.604 --> 18:51.190
because I don't know
how to tell her how disgusting it is.

18:51.273 --> 18:52.859
Now our dog weighs about 300 pounds.

18:53.484 --> 18:54.861
[phone beeping]

18:56.195 --> 18:58.280
It was still recording.

18:58.364 --> 19:01.116
She heard my whole...
She's going to kill me.

19:01.909 --> 19:05.287
Not if we hide out in Mexico.
We could fight bulls together.

19:05.496 --> 19:09.333
No, it can't work because
I don't look good in matador culottes.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.461

19:39.739 --> 19:41.615
Look, it's Team D.J.,

19:41.824 --> 19:45.160
the most reliable co-parents
on the planet.

19:48.497 --> 19:51.667
I had a text from Jackson earlier
that had me a little concerned,

19:51.876 --> 19:55.004
but it sounds like everything
went perfectly fine today.

19:55.212 --> 19:56.839
Fabulous.

19:56.923 --> 19:58.549
And flawless.

20:00.968 --> 20:03.888
- So where is Jackson?
- Oh, he's upstairs somewhere.

20:04.097 --> 20:06.140
You know, he has been quiet as a mouse

20:06.223 --> 20:09.060
ever since I solved
your whole bedroom fiasco.

20:10.978 --> 20:15.775
Boy, I wish I had
your amazing parenting skills.

20:15.983 --> 20:17.818
Don't feel bad. I know you do your best.

20:20.446 --> 20:23.240
Hey, Jackson, get in here!

20:23.449 --> 20:24.784
Here I am.

20:26.285 --> 20:29.122
Jackson, tell Team D.J. where you've been.

20:29.204 --> 20:31.999
Um, I was in Uncle Jesse's truck.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.085
I made it all the way to Fresno.

20:34.168 --> 20:36.503
This kid's got the bladder of a champ.

20:38.547 --> 20:43.510
All while Team D.J.
was being fabulous and flawless.

20:44.303 --> 20:46.680
Deej, I am so sorry.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.515
Frothy cocktail?

20:51.310 --> 20:55.439
On the bright side, three out of four
of the kids were right here all day.

20:58.151 --> 21:00.319
Okay, I think we need a family meeting.

21:01.236 --> 21:04.907
I know that look.
I feel sorry for Team D.J.

21:13.916 --> 21:16.961
- I can go home. I'm not in trouble, right?
- No, I am.

21:17.044 --> 21:18.754
It's my first day and I blew it.

21:18.838 --> 21:21.174
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Remember my first day?

21:21.381 --> 21:22.883
I changed Michelle on a meat rack,

21:22.967 --> 21:25.552
and you and D.J. were go-go dancing
on top of amplifiers,

21:25.636 --> 21:27.387
eating sundaes and pizza all night.

21:28.305 --> 21:29.890
You were so clueless.

21:29.974 --> 21:31.100
It was awesome.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.979
Well, I learned and so will you.
I love you, Steph.

21:35.188 --> 21:36.856
- You, too.
- Goodbye, everybody!

21:37.064 --> 21:38.024
[all] Bye!

21:38.232 --> 21:39.274
[phone beeping]

21:39.942 --> 21:41.694
Uh-oh. Text from Becky...

21:41.777 --> 21:45.489
"Dear Jesse, me and the fat dog
are enjoying my lasagna.

21:46.115 --> 21:48.701
Your dinner is in the doghouse
where you'll be sleeping."

21:48.909 --> 21:51.578
Actually, it's worth it
not to have to eat that lasagna.

21:54.207 --> 21:57.126
Okay, first things first...

21:57.918 --> 22:01.505
I don't want to be a person who wags her
finger while saying "first things first",

22:01.588 --> 22:02.840
so I'll put this thing away.

22:05.009 --> 22:06.886
Jackson, what were you thinking?

22:07.094 --> 22:10.848
Mom, you should know. You ran away
when Stephanie moved into your room.

22:11.057 --> 22:12.641
How would you even know that?

22:18.189 --> 22:19.899
Okay, in my defense,

22:19.982 --> 22:25.071
that was a small part of a much larger
inspirational aunt-nephew teaching moment

22:25.154 --> 22:27.447
gone horribly wrong.

22:29.283 --> 22:33.871
To your point, I ran away to the garage.
You left the county.

22:35.248 --> 22:38.959
Hey, let's not quibble over
whose runaway was better, okay?

22:43.214 --> 22:45.299
I know I shouldn't have left like that.

22:45.966 --> 22:47.509
I just got mad.

22:47.593 --> 22:52.056
I mean, first dad dies,
then we all have to move in here.

22:52.265 --> 22:56.393
Now there's more people moving in here,
and to top it all off, I lose my room.

22:58.229 --> 22:59.105
[sighs]

22:59.479 --> 23:00.898
Jax.

23:04.068 --> 23:06.862
I know this is just tough...

23:07.613 --> 23:10.657
but you have a house
full of people who love you.

23:12.243 --> 23:14.870
And as far as your room goes, I get it.

23:15.537 --> 23:18.540
I thought moving in with this squirt
was going to ruin my life.

23:20.751 --> 23:23.129
But we got really close sharing that room.

23:24.297 --> 23:26.006
And now you're here for me.

23:28.926 --> 23:32.138
You may not see it now, but living
with your brother is a blessing.

23:33.306 --> 23:34.431
Are you sure?

23:37.143 --> 23:38.894
I'm here for you, Bro.

23:40.854 --> 23:44.150
Like the little bird that eats
the parasites off the rhino's back.

23:47.069 --> 23:49.446
Can anyone explain
what this kid's talking about?

23:53.492 --> 23:56.912
It's a classic symbiotic relationship.

23:59.456 --> 24:03.585
Ramona, I know this is hard on you, too,
with your dad and I separated,

24:03.669 --> 24:05.963
but as much as I'm helping D.J.,

24:06.630 --> 24:07.756
D.J.'s helping me.

24:09.133 --> 24:11.051
I'm new at this single-parent thing.

24:11.844 --> 24:14.096
We're all figuring this out.

24:14.763 --> 24:18.058
So everybody has to do their part
to make this new family work.

24:18.267 --> 24:23.272
That means respect, compromise,
and honesty, okay?

24:23.480 --> 24:26.108
I'm in. But I was never out.

24:27.818 --> 24:28.819
Jackson?

24:29.028 --> 24:30.779
Yeah, okay.

24:31.446 --> 24:32.614
Ramona?

24:33.907 --> 24:36.660
[sighs] I can't believe
I'm going to say this,

24:36.743 --> 24:39.079
but if you're so desperate
to have your room back,

24:39.163 --> 24:40.873
I'll go live in the hobbit hole.

24:41.081 --> 24:43.334
Yes!

24:43.542 --> 24:45.127
That is so sweet of you,

24:45.336 --> 24:48.339
but I think Jackson and Max
are going to love living together.

24:48.547 --> 24:50.132
Oh, thank God!

24:53.010 --> 24:54.094
Hey, Deej,

24:54.178 --> 24:56.805
in the spirit of honesty, um...

24:56.889 --> 25:01.227
I lost my phone in your baby's diaper
and I butt-answered your call.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.437
What?

25:04.146 --> 25:07.066
Oh, like you've never lost a phone
in a diaper before.

25:08.275 --> 25:11.611
- No.
- Once, I lost a watch in some egg salad.

25:13.739 --> 25:17.910
You know what we need?
A group hug! Come on!

25:21.872 --> 25:24.250
Sorry, I forgot my lucky sunglasses.

25:25.251 --> 25:26.919
I knew there would be a hug.

25:29.296 --> 25:31.257
Is it just me or do you hear violins?
