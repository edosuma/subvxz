09:08.269 --> 09:09.240
AND TRUMP CULTIVATED THEM.

09:09.259 --> 09:11.279
>> Bill: IT'S ONE THING TO

09:12.000 --> 09:12.259
HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICS WITHIN

09:12.279 --> 09:15.000
AN ORGANIZATION, IT'S ANOTHER

09:15.019 --> 09:16.059
THING TO HAVE A FIFTH COLUMNIST.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.059
IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU'RE WILLING

09:17.080 --> 09:18.210
TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS AT SOME

09:18.230 --> 09:20.009
OF THESE PEOPLE DID ON

09:20.029 --> 09:21.169
JANUARY 6TH, THAT IS A TRUE

09:21.190 --> 09:23.100
FIFTH COLUMN, WOULD YOU AGREE?

09:23.120 --> 09:24.200
>> THEY BETRAYED THE SAME OATH

09:24.220 --> 09:30.179
THAT I TOOK AND MOST

09:30.200 --> 09:31.169
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TOOK

09:31.190 --> 09:32.230
AND THEY NEED TO BE FERRETED OUT

09:32.250 --> 09:34.039
AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW

09:34.059 --> 09:38.250
WE RECRUIT POLICE OFFICERS AND

09:38.269 --> 09:39.169
THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION --

09:39.190 --> 09:41.250
ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY IT'S TIME

09:41.269 --> 09:43.019
TO ADDRESS THIS FOR WHAT IT IS.

09:43.039 --> 09:47.120
IT'S DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND WE

09:47.139 --> 09:49.080
NEED A LAW AGAINST DOMESTIC

09:49.100 --> 09:49.159
TERRORISM.

09:49.179 --> 09:51.100
[APPLAUSE]

09:51.120 --> 09:53.120
>> Bill: WHEN YOU SAY A LAW

09:53.139 --> 09:54.279
AGAINST -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

09:55.000 --> 09:56.259
IN THIS LAW, I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE

09:56.279 --> 10:00.149
LAWS LIKE THAT ON THE BOOKS

10:00.169 --> 10:01.120
ALREADY.

10:01.139 --> 10:02.259
WHEN YOU SAY LAWS AGAINST

10:02.279 --> 10:05.080
DOMESTIC TERRORISM, WHAT I THINK

10:05.100 --> 10:06.009
IMMEDIATELY IS LISTENING, WHAT

10:06.029 --> 10:08.000
ELSE COULD IT BE?

10:08.019 --> 10:09.120
LISTENING IN ON PEOPLE.

10:09.139 --> 10:11.179
FRANK, I LOVE THE FBI BUT THEY

10:11.200 --> 10:13.240
DID HAVE A TAPE RECORDER UNDER

10:13.259 --> 10:14.190
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S BED, THIS

10:14.210 --> 10:16.220
GOES WAY BACK, WHAT'S THE BEST

10:16.240 --> 10:19.000
WAY TO STOP BAD GUYS?

10:19.019 --> 10:20.129
LISTEN IN ON THE SHIT THEY ARE

10:20.149 --> 10:21.000
THINKING AND PLANNING BEFORE

10:21.019 --> 10:31.169
THEY EVEN KNOW YOU'RE IN ON IT.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.029
>> IT'S TIME TO HAVE THIS

10:32.049 --> 10:32.220
DISCUSSION SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IF

10:32.240 --> 10:33.100
YOU ROB A BANK, YOU DON'T GET

10:33.120 --> 10:33.279
ARRESTED FOR TRESPASS, YOU GET

10:34.009 --> 10:34.159
ARRESTED FOR ROBBING A BANK,

10:34.179 --> 10:36.070
IT'S A SERIOUS CRIME, ACTUALLY A

10:36.090 --> 10:37.289
CRIME AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

10:38.009 --> 10:39.250
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAPITOL?

10:39.269 --> 10:40.250
IS IT TRESPASS?

10:40.269 --> 10:42.250
WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE GET

10:42.269 --> 10:44.129
ARRESTED FOR TRESPASS, THEFT OF

10:44.149 --> 10:45.070
NANCY PELOSI'S PODIUM WHICH I'M

10:45.090 --> 10:47.009
SURE IS NEAR AND DEAR TO HER BUT

10:47.029 --> 10:48.110
THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE GRAVITY

10:48.129 --> 10:50.129
OF WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT HAPPENED

10:50.149 --> 10:51.250
WAS AN INSURRECTION, WHAT

10:51.269 --> 10:52.169
HAPPENED WAS DOMESTIC TERRORISM

10:52.190 --> 10:55.159
AND WE CAN'T CHARGE IT.

10:55.179 --> 10:56.230
DOMESTIC TERRORISM IS THE ONLY

10:56.250 --> 10:59.240
CRIMINAL CATEGORY IN THE FBI

10:59.259 --> 11:00.240
WHERE THEY CAN INVESTIGATE YOU

11:00.259 --> 11:02.059
BUT THEY CAN NEVER CHARGE YOU,

11:02.080 --> 11:05.110
THERE'S NO SUCH CRIME.

11:05.129 --> 11:06.129
>> Bill: I'M ASKING YOU WHAT

11:06.149 --> 11:07.230
IS THE LAW THAT WE ARE GOING TO

11:07.250 --> 11:09.169
PASS THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE

11:09.190 --> 11:11.200
THIS AND IS ALSO GOING TO

11:11.220 --> 11:12.210
RESPECT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT?

11:12.230 --> 11:15.139
>> I ADVOCATE A LAW THAT LOOKS

11:15.159 --> 11:16.070
JUST LIKE INTERNATIONAL

11:16.090 --> 11:16.210
TERRORISM.

11:16.230 --> 11:18.019
IF YOU CHANGE THE RELIGION OF

11:18.039 --> 11:19.230
THOSE PEOPLE AT THE CAPITOL

11:19.250 --> 11:21.250
BUILDING ON JANUARY 6TH AND YOU

11:21.269 --> 11:23.139
MAKE THEIR MISSION VIOLENT JIHAD

11:23.159 --> 11:25.070
OR ESTABLISHING A CALIPHATE, ALL

11:25.090 --> 11:26.110
OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE

11:26.129 --> 11:27.169
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM LAW AND

11:27.190 --> 11:28.100
THEY GO TO THE PRISON FOR THE

11:28.120 --> 11:32.120
REST OF THEIR LIVES.

11:32.139 --> 11:32.269
[APPLAUSE]

11:32.289 --> 11:33.200
>> Bill: THE DIFFERENCE IS WE

11:33.220 --> 11:37.090
WOULD BE LISTENING TO THOSE

11:37.110 --> 11:38.039
PEOPLE OVERSEAS.

11:38.059 --> 11:41.049
WE WOULD BE LISTENING TO THEM --

11:41.070 --> 11:43.179
WE ARE ALLOWED TO LISTEN TO

11:43.200 --> 11:44.070
CALLS FROM PAKISTAN.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.129
>> LET ME CATCH YOU UP, WE

11:46.149 --> 11:48.090
LISTEN TO THOSE PEOPLE HERE,

11:48.110 --> 11:50.220
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM LAW HER

11:50.240 --> 11:50.279
HERE.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
>> Bill: DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

11:52.019 --> 11:55.179
CONNECTED TO SOMETHING OVERSEAS?

11:55.200 --> 11:56.070
THESE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO

11:56.090 --> 12:00.200
ATTACK THE CAPITOL WOULD NOT BE

12:00.220 --> 12:02.240
IN THAT CATEGORY, IT'S A LITTLE

12:02.259 --> 12:03.169
BIT DIFFERENT.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.289
>> THAT'S MY POINT.

12:05.009 --> 12:05.169
>> Bill: YOU'RE SAYING WE

12:05.190 --> 12:06.250
SHOULD BE ABLE TO LISTEN IN ON

12:06.269 --> 12:09.100
THEM TOO.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.090
>> I'M SAYING THE FBI IS

12:11.110 --> 12:11.210
SAYING --

12:11.230 --> 12:13.179
>> Bill: I'M NOT AGAINST THAT.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.289
>> LET'S TALK IT OUT, WHEN FBI

12:16.009 --> 12:16.289
AGENTS RANK AND FILE WRITE A

12:17.009 --> 12:17.250
LETTER TO CONGRESS AS THEY DID

12:17.269 --> 12:20.129
LAST YEAR AND SAY THE DOMESTIC

12:20.149 --> 12:21.039
TERRORISM OCCURRING UNDER THIS

12:21.059 --> 12:22.120
ADMINISTRATION IS SOMETHING WE

12:22.139 --> 12:24.120
CAN'T HANDLE AND DON'T HAVE THE

12:24.139 --> 12:25.259
INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS FOR AND WE

12:25.279 --> 12:29.080
NEED A DOMESTIC TERRORISM LAW.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.179
WHEN THE FOLKS WHO ARE CHARGED

12:30.200 --> 12:31.139
WITH PROTECTING US SAY THEY

12:31.159 --> 12:34.019
CAN'T DO IT, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO

12:34.039 --> 12:34.230
THEM.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.100
IT'S BEEN PROPOSED FREQUENTLY IN

12:36.120 --> 12:37.039
THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND KEEPS

12:37.059 --> 12:39.090
GETTING KNOCKED DOWN, IT GETS

12:39.110 --> 12:40.070
KNOCKED DOWN BECAUSE OF CIVIL

12:40.090 --> 12:41.039
LIBERTIES CONCERNS BUT IT'S TIME

12:41.059 --> 12:42.179
TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.169
>> Bill: YOU WOULD ALSO ALLOW,

12:44.190 --> 12:46.129
WOULD YOU NOT, AS BAD AS THE

12:46.149 --> 12:48.139
PROUD BOYS AND BOOGALOO BOYS AND

12:48.159 --> 12:50.149
WHOEVER THESE CRAZY PEOPLE ARE,

12:50.169 --> 12:52.220
THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO ACQUIRE

12:52.240 --> 12:56.289
NUCLEAR WEAPONS LIKE THE JIHADIS

12:57.009 --> 12:57.080
ARE.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.039
>> I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT

12:59.059 --> 12:59.100
THAT.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.029
>> Bill: COME ON, THEY'RE

13:00.049 --> 13:01.169
GOING TO BLOW UP THEIR OWN?

13:01.190 --> 13:03.289
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT ARRESTS THAT

13:04.009 --> 13:06.009
HAVE BEEN MADE WITH PEOPLE

13:06.029 --> 13:07.169
BUILDING RADIOACTIVE BOMBS,

13:07.190 --> 13:10.019
BIOCHEMICAL WARFARE, ANTHRAX,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.269
RICIN, THEY ARE TRYING.

13:12.289 --> 13:15.059
HERE'S THE THING, THIS KIND OF

13:15.080 --> 13:17.080
CIVIL LIBERTIES THING IS VALID

13:17.100 --> 13:19.240
BUT ALSO STOPS US FROM HAVING

13:19.259 --> 13:21.139
THE LAW SO LET'S TAKE BABY

13:21.159 --> 13:23.240
STEPS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET

13:23.259 --> 13:25.220
INTO TOOLS AND A SPYING ON

13:25.240 --> 13:26.190
AMERICAN CITIZENS BUT BY GOD

13:26.210 --> 13:28.179
WHEN THEY DO IT AND WE CATCH

13:28.200 --> 13:29.159
THEM, LET'S CHARGE THEM WITH

13:29.179 --> 13:31.289
SOMETHING THAT SENDS THEM AWAY

13:32.009 --> 13:32.259
FOR 20 YEARS TO LIFE BECAUSE

13:32.279 --> 13:35.100
THEY ARE TERRORISTS.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.110
>> Bill: THEY CERTAINLY ARE.

13:37.129 --> 13:40.070
LET ME ASK YOU WHAT YOU THINK IS

13:40.090 --> 13:43.029
BEHIND THAT.

13:43.049 --> 13:44.000
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THIS VAST

13:44.019 --> 13:46.269
ARRAY OF SEETHING MEN -- IT'S

13:46.289 --> 13:49.129
ALWAYS MEN, MOSTLY MEN, USUALLY

13:49.149 --> 13:55.000
WHITE MEN, OKAY -- PROUD BOYS,

13:55.019 --> 13:56.000
HAVE YOU EVER FOUND OUT WHAT

13:56.019 --> 13:59.100
THEY ARE PROUD OF?

13:59.120 --> 14:00.159
[LAUGHTER]

14:00.179 --> 14:03.080
HAS THE AGENCY GOTTEN THAT?

14:03.100 --> 14:06.200
TO ME, IT'S PROBABLY MORE WHAT'S

14:06.220 --> 14:08.049
GOING ON IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE

14:08.070 --> 14:10.059
AND THEN THEY ATTACH POLITICS TO

14:10.080 --> 14:10.110
IT.

14:10.129 --> 14:12.159
I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING WITH

14:12.179 --> 14:13.120
ISLAMIC TERRORISM.

14:13.139 --> 14:14.059
I THINK IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND

14:14.080 --> 14:18.049
YOU'RE GETTING LAID, YOU'RE NOT

14:18.070 --> 14:20.049
BLOWING SHIT UP.

14:20.070 --> 14:20.129
[LAUGHTER]

14:20.149 --> 14:20.210
[APPLAUSE]

14:20.230 --> 14:24.090
>> THIS IS MY POINT, WHAT WE'VE

14:24.110 --> 14:24.289
SEEN OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS

14:25.009 --> 14:27.080
LOOKS A LOT TO ME LIKE THE KIND

14:27.100 --> 14:29.289
OF RADICALIZATION PROCESS WE SEE

14:30.009 --> 14:30.250
WHEN PEOPLE MOVE TOWARDS VIOLENT

14:30.269 --> 14:32.009
JIHAD AND IT IS SOMETHING IN

14:32.029 --> 14:33.139
THEIR LIFE THAT CAUSES THEM TO

14:33.159 --> 14:35.190
LOOK FOR A CAUSE GREATER THAN

14:35.210 --> 14:37.250
THEMSELVES, A FEELING OF

14:37.269 --> 14:38.240
DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND I THINK

14:38.259 --> 14:39.259
YOU'RE MAKING MY POINT, THESE

14:39.279 --> 14:42.120
ARE RADICALIZED PEOPLE WHO NEED

14:42.139 --> 14:43.179
TO BE TREATED LIKE DOMESTIC

14:43.200 --> 14:43.269
TERRORISTS.

14:43.289 --> 14:44.210
>> Bill: I WOULD DISAGREE WITH

14:44.230 --> 14:47.049
THAT COME I'M JUST QUIZZING YOU.

14:47.070 --> 14:50.039
>> DID I PASS?

14:50.059 --> 14:52.159
[LAUGHTER]

14:52.179 --> 14:53.210
>> Bill: JANUARY 6TH THING

14:53.230 --> 14:57.120
WASN'T THE FBI'S BEAT, BUT WHEN

14:57.139 --> 14:58.220
I THINK OF THE FBI I THINK THAT

14:58.240 --> 15:00.090
IS THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE

15:00.110 --> 15:02.159
HERE, SHOULD THEY HAVE DONE

15:02.179 --> 15:03.059
MORE?

15:03.080 --> 15:06.019
I THINK OF THAT TERM FAILURE OF

15:06.039 --> 15:06.200
IMAGINATION THAT WE HAD AFTER

15:06.220 --> 15:09.159
9/11, I FEEL LIKE THEY FAILED TO

15:09.179 --> 15:11.179
IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE

15:11.200 --> 15:12.049
PRO-TRUMP WOULD ALSO BE SO

15:12.070 --> 15:16.059
AGAINST AUTHORITY.

15:16.080 --> 15:16.240
IT SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT

15:16.259 --> 15:18.149
IT'S NOT.

15:18.169 --> 15:20.039
>> HERE'S WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLING

15:20.059 --> 15:22.220
THE INSURRECTION, IT'S NOT A

15:22.240 --> 15:23.110
FAILURE OF INTELLIGENCE SO MUCH

15:23.129 --> 15:27.230
AS A FAILURE TO ACT ON AVAILABLE

15:27.250 --> 15:28.159
INTELLIGENCE.

15:28.179 --> 15:30.110
YOU AND I CAN SIT AT HOME ON OUR

15:30.129 --> 15:31.080
RECLINER AND WATCH ON

15:31.100 --> 15:35.230
SOCIAL MEDIA THIS THING PLAY OUT

15:35.250 --> 15:36.240
ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE

15:36.259 --> 15:37.039
INSURRECTION.

15:37.059 --> 15:38.279
THEY HAD IT, THEY DID PASS IT TO

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
THE CAPITOL POLICE, FBI OFFICES

15:43.019 --> 15:44.139
SAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A

15:44.159 --> 15:44.240
PROBLEM HERE.

15:44.259 --> 15:48.110
THE PROBLEM IS TWO FOLD.

15:48.129 --> 15:49.070
THE FBI DOESN'T PROTECT

15:49.090 --> 15:50.230
BUILDINGS BUT ALSO I'M NOT

15:50.250 --> 15:52.240
BUYING THIS WE TOLD THE CAPITOL

15:52.259 --> 15:53.149
POLICE, NOT OUR PROBLEM, THAT'S

15:53.169 --> 15:54.200
NOT HOW IT WORKS.

15:54.220 --> 15:58.159
YOU'RE RIGHT, IF WE CHANGE

15:58.179 --> 15:59.230
RELIGION OR COLOR OF ALL THESE

15:59.250 --> 16:00.269
PEOPLE PLANNING THIS WE MIGHT

16:00.289 --> 16:02.159
HAVE SEEN A MORE AGGRESSIVE

16:02.179 --> 16:04.289
RESPONSE, THAT'S A PROBLEM.

16:05.009 --> 16:06.139
>> Bill: THANK YOU, FRANK, YOU

16:06.159 --> 16:08.240
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE

16:08.259 --> 16:10.120
ON TV, YOU SHOULD BE BACK IN THE

16:10.139 --> 16:13.279
FBI BUILDING.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.169
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL!

16:16.190 --> 16:17.110

GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH.

16:33.230 --> 16:34.200
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

16:34.220 --> 16:35.149
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH THE

16:35.169 --> 16:40.000
FIRST PRESS BRIEFING THE DAY

16:40.019 --> 16:40.279
BIDEN WAS INAUGURATED, I DON'T

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
EVEN HAVE THE NAMES YET.

16:45.019 --> 16:45.129
>> JEN PSAKI.

16:45.149 --> 16:46.230
>> Bill: SHE IS GOOD TO.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.190
>> THE BAR IS LOW.

16:48.210 --> 16:50.110
>> Bill: RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

16:50.129 --> 16:50.289
IT GIVES HER A SHOT RIGHT OFF

16:51.009 --> 16:53.159
THE BAT.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.129
>> SHE IS GREAT BUT THE BAR IS

16:56.149 --> 16:56.179
LOW.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.080
>> Bill: OF COURSE IT IS BUT

16:58.100 --> 17:00.149
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE, I FEEL LIKE

17:00.169 --> 17:02.070
TALKING TO MY FRIENDS, EVERYONE

17:02.090 --> 17:03.279
HAS THIS DREAMLIKE QUALITY TO

17:04.000 --> 17:07.279
THE EXPERIENCE, DID THAT REALLY

17:08.000 --> 17:08.150
HAPPEN?

17:08.170 --> 17:10.160
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THE

17:10.180 --> 17:11.259
TV SHOW DALLAS, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG

17:11.279 --> 17:13.180
FOR SURE BUT THEY HAD A WHOLE

17:13.200 --> 17:15.289
EPISODE WHERE IT WAS A DREAM,

17:16.009 --> 17:17.130
PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THE WHOLE

17:17.150 --> 17:19.170
SEASON, IT WAS A DREAM AND THE

17:19.190 --> 17:20.210
NEXT SEASON STARTED AND GUYS IN

17:20.230 --> 17:22.019
THE SHOWER ARE LIKE I DREAMED

17:22.039 --> 17:26.009
THAT SEASON, THAT'S HOW I FELT.

17:26.029 --> 17:27.109
>> IT WAS SHOCKINGLY NORMAL AND

17:27.130 --> 17:28.230
I THINK IT WAS HELPED BY THE

17:28.250 --> 17:30.019
FACT THAT WHATEVER YOU THINK

17:30.039 --> 17:32.289
ABOUT THE IDEA OF A TECH

17:33.009 --> 17:33.220
PLATFORM KICKING A POLITICAL

17:33.240 --> 17:36.049
LEADER OF A PLATFORM, IT WAS

17:36.069 --> 17:37.269
HELPED BY THE FACT THAT TRUMP

17:37.289 --> 17:39.029
WASN'T ABLE TO TWEET DURING THE

17:39.049 --> 17:40.109
INAUGURATION FOR THE FIRST FEW

17:40.130 --> 17:44.150
DAYS, IT DOES FEEL LIKE THE

17:44.170 --> 17:45.119
WHOLE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS

17:45.140 --> 17:46.289
JUST DISAPPEARED AND WE LIVED

17:47.009 --> 17:47.230
THROUGH A FEVER DREAM.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.069
>> Bill: HERE'S THE KEY

17:49.089 --> 17:50.099
QUESTION, HOW MUCH POWER DOES HE

17:50.119 --> 17:53.109
RETAIN?

17:53.130 --> 17:53.240
DONALD TRUMP.

17:53.259 --> 17:55.009
THAT WILL TELL A LOT.

17:55.029 --> 17:57.119
IS IT THE END OF TRAINING DAY

17:57.140 --> 17:59.180
WERE DENZEL WASHINGTON IS LIKE

17:59.200 --> 18:01.170
"I'M KING KONG UP HERE" AND THEY

18:01.190 --> 18:04.220
ARE LIKE "NO YOU'RE NOT ANYMORE,

18:04.240 --> 18:07.099
YOUR POWER IS GONE."

18:07.119 --> 18:07.180
[LAUGHTER]

18:07.200 --> 18:07.259
[APPLAUSE]

18:07.279 --> 18:09.210
>> IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, THERE

18:09.230 --> 18:11.180
IS SOME INDICATION THAT SOME OF

18:11.200 --> 18:13.099
TRUMP'S BASE OF SUPPORT SEEMS TO

18:13.119 --> 18:15.119
BE ERODING, HIS BRAND IS I WIN,

18:15.140 --> 18:17.130
I GO OUT AND I WIN AND HE VERY

18:17.150 --> 18:22.160
MUCH LOST IN TH THERE MAY BE A

18:22.180 --> 18:24.000
NARRATIVE OUT THERE ABOUT HAVING

18:24.019 --> 18:25.289
WON BUT A LOT OF FOLKS AREN'T

18:26.009 --> 18:27.279
BUYING THAT ANYMORE.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.009
NIXON LEADS OFFICE, REPUBLICANS

18:29.029 --> 18:30.210
ARE HIGH ON HIM, LESS RELUCTANT

18:30.230 --> 18:35.039
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AWFULNESS.

18:35.059 --> 18:36.099
>> Bill: THEY SAY HE'S

18:36.119 --> 18:37.039
STARTING THIS PATRIOT PARTY,

18:37.059 --> 18:41.039
THAT'S THE NAME OF IT.

18:41.059 --> 18:42.190
THAT SOUNDS LIKE NAZIS TO ME,

18:42.210 --> 18:44.250
NOT LIKE THEY ARE KILLING ALL

18:44.269 --> 18:48.170
THE JEWS, WHENEVER YOU ARE THAT

18:48.190 --> 18:50.089
BLATANT ABOUT IT WE ARE THE

18:50.109 --> 18:52.049
PATRIOTS, WHERE THE GOOD PEOPLE.

18:52.069 --> 18:53.059
>> WOULD YOU PREFER TRUMP

18:53.079 --> 18:54.250
ORGANIZATION IS THE NAME OF THE

18:54.269 --> 18:56.049
NEW ENTITY?

18:56.069 --> 18:59.289
>> Bill: I ACTUALLY WOULD DO.

19:00.009 --> 19:02.150
"PATRIOT PARTY" IS VERY BROWN

19:02.170 --> 19:05.019
SHIRTY, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO

19:05.039 --> 19:08.009
BELIEVE MIGHT IS RIGHT, TWO

19:08.029 --> 19:09.009
GENERATIONS PAST WHERE THEY

19:09.029 --> 19:10.109
TAUGHT ANYTHING IN SCHOOL, IT'S

19:10.130 --> 19:12.119
NOT LIKE PEOPLE KNOW THEY ARE

19:12.140 --> 19:12.279
VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION

19:13.000 --> 19:13.190
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S

19:13.210 --> 19:16.039
IN IT TO BEGIN WITH.

19:16.059 --> 19:17.000
THEY DON'T KNOW THEY ARE

19:17.019 --> 19:20.230
FASCISTS BUT THEY ARE.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.180
THEY ARE ALL GOING TO BE IN THE

19:22.200 --> 19:23.190
PATRIOT PARTY AND THAT'S GOING

19:23.210 --> 19:24.289
TO BE A DANGEROUS -- TALK ABOUT

19:25.009 --> 19:27.140
FIFTH COLUMN.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.089
>> I SAW SOME PEOPLE ON TWITTER

19:29.109 --> 19:32.039
SNICKERING ABOUT THE IDEA OF

19:32.059 --> 19:33.069
TRUMP CREATING A PATRIOT PARTY

19:33.089 --> 19:34.200
IN PART BECAUSE TRUMP DOESN'T

19:34.220 --> 19:37.279
HAVE THE WORK ETHIC TO DO SUCH A

19:38.000 --> 19:38.109
THING.

19:38.130 --> 19:40.200
>> TRUMP UNIVERSITY, TRUMP

19:40.220 --> 19:41.089
STAKES.

19:41.109 --> 19:43.220
>> Bill: HE HAS PEOPLE AROUND

19:43.240 --> 19:45.039
HIM.

19:45.059 --> 19:48.140
>> I TAKE IT SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY,

19:48.160 --> 19:50.170
USE ALL THESE PEOPLE IN THE

19:50.190 --> 19:51.039
CONSERVATIVE UNIVERSE FROM

19:51.059 --> 19:51.269
LOU DOBBS TO CHARLIE KIRK SAY

19:51.289 --> 19:55.119
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.289
IF ANYONE CAN GET BALLOT ACCESS,

19:57.009 --> 20:00.230
RAISE SMALL DONOR MONEY, HAVE

20:00.250 --> 20:03.160
SUPPORT IN EVERY SINGLE STATE

20:03.180 --> 20:04.059
OUTSIDE OF A POLITICAL PARTY,

20:04.079 --> 20:07.039
IT'S DONALD TRUMP.

20:07.059 --> 20:09.099
THE PROBLEM IS IT WOULD JUST

20:09.119 --> 20:10.259
DEPRIVE HIM IN A DIFFERENT WAY

20:10.279 --> 20:12.259
OF POWER.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.130
THE WAFER TRUMP IS TO REACH

20:14.150 --> 20:16.130
SUCCESS IS TO DO THE HOSTILE

20:16.150 --> 20:18.049
TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN

20:18.069 --> 20:19.099
PARTY, TO WIN REPUBLICAN

20:19.119 --> 20:21.160
PRIMARIES AND WIN ELECTIONS.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.250
PATRIOT PARTY WOULD HOLD DOWN

20:22.269 --> 20:24.170
REPUBLICAN VOTES AS A THIRD

20:24.190 --> 20:25.269
PARTY IN THE GENERAL ELECTION,

20:25.289 --> 20:28.089
IT WOULD ALLOW DEMOCRATS TO WIN

20:28.109 --> 20:29.079
BECAUSE IT WOULD SIPHON VOTERS

20:29.099 --> 20:32.039
OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

20:32.059 --> 20:34.019
>> ANOTHER AVENUE IS TO TAKE

20:34.039 --> 20:40.220
ADVANTAGE OF ONE OF THE PARTIES

20:40.240 --> 20:41.069
THAT EXIST COME ANOTHER

20:41.089 --> 20:43.099
LIBERTARIAN PARTY OR ONE OF THE

20:43.119 --> 20:45.160
REFORM PARTY'S -- I'M MORE

20:45.180 --> 20:46.119
SKEPTICAL OF THIS PROPOSITION,

20:46.140 --> 20:49.079
IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF

20:49.099 --> 20:49.180
ORGANIZATION.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.019
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE KNOW

20:52.039 --> 20:53.039
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HE'S NOT

20:53.059 --> 20:53.210
WELL ORGANIZED.

20:53.230 --> 20:55.029
>> Bill: I MUST TELL YOU

20:55.049 --> 20:56.029
GENTLEMEN, THIS DOES SOUND LIKE

20:56.049 --> 20:59.109
THE SAME SHIT I HEARD BEFORE HE

20:59.130 --> 21:00.170
BECAME PRESIDENT.

21:00.190 --> 21:01.230
DONALD TRUMP IS JUST A BUFFOON,

21:01.250 --> 21:03.140
HE'S NOT SERIOUS, HE'LL NEVER DO

21:03.160 --> 21:06.180
THIS, HE'LL NEVER DO THAT AND HE

21:06.200 --> 21:06.269
DID IT ALL.

21:06.289 --> 21:09.180
>> BALLOT ACCESS H IS DIFFERENT

21:09.200 --> 21:15.049
FROM HAVING BRAND NAME

21:15.069 --> 21:15.220
RECOGNITION.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.029
THE NOTION OF REFERRING TO THESE

21:18.049 --> 21:19.269
PEOPLE AS FASCISTS -- I OFTEN

21:19.289 --> 21:21.180
WORRY ABOUT GIVING THE MAN TOO

21:21.200 --> 21:23.109
MUCH CREDIT AND I WORRY ABOUT

21:23.130 --> 21:24.220
USING WORDS THAT ARE HIGHLY

21:24.240 --> 21:26.240
CHARGED THAT MAY NOT IN FACT

21:26.259 --> 21:30.029
ILLUMINATE THE CONVERSATION.

21:30.049 --> 21:33.049
>> Bill: I AGREE WITH THAT IN

21:33.069 --> 21:34.039
THEORY, THERE'S A LOT OF

21:34.059 --> 21:35.160
DEFINITIONS OF FASCISM.

21:35.180 --> 21:39.019
I'VE HEARD MANY OVER THE YEARS,

21:39.039 --> 21:40.089
LEARNED OF PEOPLE DISAGREE BUT

21:40.109 --> 21:41.269
THE ONE THING WE LINE UP BEHIND,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.140
THE IDEA THAT MIGHT MAKES RIGHT

21:44.160 --> 21:46.130
AND WE DON'T RESPECT DEMOCRATIC

21:46.150 --> 21:46.190
NORMS.

21:46.210 --> 21:49.240
IF YOU CAN'T CALL WHAT THE

21:49.259 --> 21:51.279
PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO UNDO THE

21:52.000 --> 21:56.049
ELECTION, EVEN THE REPUBLICAN

21:56.069 --> 21:57.109
JUDGES -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT

21:57.130 --> 22:00.019
FASCISM IS.

22:00.039 --> 22:03.269
WHAT DEFINITION DO WE HAVE FOUR

22:03.289 --> 22:04.019
AT?

22:04.039 --> 22:06.289
THAT IS FASCISM, A LOT OF THESE

22:07.009 --> 22:08.150
PEOPLE, EVEN THE REPUBLICANS IN

22:08.170 --> 22:10.140
CONGRESS, THEY ARE NOT SORRY

22:10.160 --> 22:12.289
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON

22:13.009 --> 22:13.160
JANUARY 6TH, THEY ARE SORRY

22:13.180 --> 22:15.160
DIDN'T WORK.

22:15.180 --> 22:18.119
>> THEY ARE SORRY IT HAPPENED TO

22:18.140 --> 22:19.180
THEM, THEY FELT PERSONALLY

22:19.200 --> 22:20.170
THREATENED.

22:20.190 --> 22:21.119
THAT'S ONE REASON McCONNELL IS

22:21.140 --> 22:24.279
SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.269
>> I'M SKEPTICAL THEY DON'T

22:26.289 --> 22:28.029
REGRET THIS HAPPENED.

22:28.049 --> 22:29.289
I JUST WANT TO PUT IT INTO

22:30.009 --> 22:31.230
ANOTHER CONTEXT, IMAGINE ONE

22:31.250 --> 22:33.000
POSSIBILITY, WHAT WE'VE SEEN

22:33.019 --> 22:35.279
OVER THE LAST TEN, 12 MONTHS IS

22:36.000 --> 22:37.279
A BIT OF UNRAVELING.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.009
THIS ESCALATION OF POLITICAL

22:39.029 --> 22:40.099
VIOLENCE IT IS NOT LIMITED TO

22:40.119 --> 22:42.150
THE RIGHT BUT IT HAS EXISTED ON

22:42.170 --> 22:44.210
THE LEFT AS WELL.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.160
WE SAW $2 BILLION WORTH OF

22:46.180 --> 22:47.259
DAMAGE DONE OVER SEVERAL MONTHS,

22:47.279 --> 22:49.109
WE SAW DAYS OF CIVIL UNREST IN

22:49.130 --> 22:50.240
THE STREETS, WAS A FEDERAL

22:50.259 --> 22:52.279
BUILDING SURROUNDED AND HELD

22:53.000 --> 22:56.170
UNDER SIEGE FOR DAYS AT A TIME.

22:56.190 --> 22:57.160
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF

22:57.180 --> 22:59.220
AMERICA AND WE HAVE SEEN A

22:59.240 --> 23:00.289
STEADY INCREASE IN THE

23:01.009 --> 23:01.279
REGULARITY AND FREQUENCY OF

23:02.000 --> 23:02.240
POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THIS

23:02.259 --> 23:04.170
COUNTRY AND IF THERE IS A

23:04.190 --> 23:05.289
BROADER TREND AS OPPOSED TO A

23:06.009 --> 23:07.200
SPECIFIC MOVEMENT THAT IS

23:07.220 --> 23:09.029
BROKEN, THEN WE ARE TALKING

23:09.049 --> 23:10.150
ABOUT TOO NARROW A PROBLEM AS

23:10.170 --> 23:11.019
OPPOSED TO THE RIGHT PROBLEM

23:11.039 --> 23:13.250
WHICH MIGHT BE A MAJOR DEFECT IN

23:13.269 --> 23:17.279
OUR POLICY.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.269
>> GOING BACK TO THE SEATTLE WT

23:20.289 --> 23:23.039
OH PROTESTS IN 2,000, THERE'S

23:23.059 --> 23:24.049
ALWAYS BEEN AN ANARCHIST BLACK

23:24.069 --> 23:27.059
BLOCK OF GUTTER PUNK ON THE

23:27.079 --> 23:28.079
LEFT.

23:28.099 --> 23:28.240
>> THIS WAS SUSTAINED COME

23:28.259 --> 23:32.099
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

23:32.119 --> 23:38.170
>> SURE, BUT TRUMP HAS INFECTED

23:38.190 --> 23:39.279
EVERY STATE CAPITAL.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.109
>> WE WERE PROMISED ARMED

23:41.130 --> 23:42.200
REBELLION, THAT DID NOT

23:42.220 --> 23:43.259
MATERIALIZE WHICH IS WHY I'M

23:43.279 --> 23:45.140
SAYING I'M WORRIED WE MAY BE

23:45.160 --> 23:46.150
MISSED CASTING THIS.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.170
IF WE ARE THINKING IT'S TRUMP

23:47.190 --> 23:49.140
AND TRUMP IS THE PROBLEM, AS YOU

23:49.160 --> 23:50.180
MENTIONED ALREADY EARLIER IN THE

23:50.200 --> 23:52.190
SHOW, WE SAW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

23:52.210 --> 23:54.039
IN THE STREETS BREAKING WINDOWS

23:54.059 --> 23:56.089
AFTER BIDEN WON.

23:56.109 --> 23:58.109
SOMETHING IS WRONG AND I WORRY

23:58.130 --> 23:59.240
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS.

23:59.259 --> 24:00.160
>> Bill: THAT'S A GREAT

24:00.180 --> 24:03.079
QUESTION TO GET TO KNOW THAT

24:03.099 --> 24:04.279
WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF TRUMP, WE

24:05.000 --> 24:06.170
ARE FACED WITH THIS PROBLEM AS

24:06.190 --> 24:06.279
AMERICANS.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.059
NOW WE CAN'T BLAME EVERYTHING ON

24:09.079 --> 24:09.289
HIM.

24:10.009 --> 24:11.130
NOW WE HAVE TO LOOK IN THE

24:11.150 --> 24:12.079
MIRROR AND WE'LL FIND OUT IN THE

24:12.099 --> 24:15.089
NEXT HUNDRED DAYS IF IT WAS ALL

24:15.109 --> 24:16.150
TRUMP WHO WAS THE BAD GUY AND I

24:16.170 --> 24:18.230
SAID FROM THE BEGINNING WITH THE

24:18.250 --> 24:22.160
VIRUS, HE CERTAINLY PLAYED HIS

24:22.180 --> 24:23.210
PART HORRIBLY BEGINNING WITH

24:23.230 --> 24:25.029
GETTING THAT LITTLE TEAM OUT OF

24:25.049 --> 24:25.200
CHINA THAT COULD'VE STOPPED

24:25.220 --> 24:29.150
STOPPED THE WHOLE FUCKING THING

24:29.170 --> 24:32.089
TO BEGIN WITH, BUT IT'S ALSO ON

24:32.109 --> 24:32.250
THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

24:32.269 --> 24:33.210
ESTABLISHMENT THAT NEVER TOLD

24:33.230 --> 24:35.009
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE BEST

24:35.029 --> 24:37.079
WAY YOU CAN HANDLE THIS IS GET

24:37.099 --> 24:38.279
YOURSELF IN BETTER SHAPE, GET

24:39.000 --> 24:41.230
YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BETTER, STOP

24:41.250 --> 24:42.180
EATING SHIT FOOD AND SUGAR AND

24:42.200 --> 24:43.289
DAY DRINKING, THEY NEVER HAD THE

24:44.009 --> 24:45.119
GUTS TO DO THAT, THEY WOULDN'T

24:45.140 --> 24:47.089
EVEN SAY THE WORD OBESITY ON

24:47.109 --> 24:48.059
TELEVISION.

24:48.079 --> 24:51.009
THAT WOULD BE FAT SHAMING.

24:51.029 --> 24:56.089
THE CODE NOW IS "PRECONDITION."

24:56.109 --> 24:57.240
CAN AMERICA DO THIS?

24:57.259 --> 24:58.130
COMPETENCE IS ALWAYS WHAT I COME

24:58.150 --> 25:00.029
BACK TO.

25:00.049 --> 25:02.049
I SEE IT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL IN

25:02.069 --> 25:03.119
MY LIFE, WE ALL DO WHEN WE USED

25:03.140 --> 25:05.269
TO GO OUT -- WHEN WE USED TO

25:05.289 --> 25:09.069
HAVE DAYS TO GO OUT IN -- AND I

25:09.089 --> 25:12.160
SEE IT ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, CAN

25:12.180 --> 25:13.059
WE DO SHIT ANYMORE?

25:13.079 --> 25:15.019
WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE VACCINE

25:15.039 --> 25:17.200
ROLE OUTGOING, THAT'S NOT A

25:17.220 --> 25:20.039
GREAT HARBINGER OF WHAT'S TO

25:20.059 --> 25:20.140
COME.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.190
CAN WE, EVEN IF WE CAN'T BLAME

25:21.210 --> 25:24.190
IT ON TRUMP?

25:24.210 --> 25:27.200
>> HERE IN THE GREAT SOCIALIST

25:27.220 --> 25:29.160
REPUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA, IT'S

25:29.180 --> 25:30.140
INSANELY HARD TO GET --

25:30.160 --> 25:32.049
>> Bill: DON'T GET ME STARTED,

25:32.069 --> 25:32.230
YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.

25:32.250 --> 25:35.279
>> SAME.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.039
HERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE, MY

25:37.059 --> 25:39.029
PARENTS ARE IN THEIR EARLY

25:39.049 --> 25:41.119
70s, MY MOM GOT VACCINATED

25:41.140 --> 25:42.220
TODAY AT A DISTRIBUTION CENTER

25:42.240 --> 25:43.109
IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.

25:43.130 --> 25:45.200
MY DAD IS GETTING VACCINATED AT

25:45.220 --> 25:47.069
A KROGER.

25:47.089 --> 25:50.180
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS SO

25:50.200 --> 25:53.089
BUNK THAT WE ARE GOING TO CVS

25:53.109 --> 25:55.109
AND WALGREENS AND I THINK IT'S A

25:55.130 --> 25:56.000
LITTLE BIT TOO GLIB OF THE LEFT

25:56.019 --> 25:59.019
TO SAY THAT NATIONALIZED

25:59.039 --> 25:59.190
HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY

25:59.210 --> 26:02.130
WOULD HAVE MADE OUR COVID

26:02.150 --> 26:04.170
RESPONSE THAT MUCH BETTER BUT

26:04.190 --> 26:08.039
CERTAINLY ON THE DISTRIBUTION

26:08.059 --> 26:09.180
FRONT, IT WOULD'VE BEEN WAY

26:09.200 --> 26:11.150
BETTER.

26:11.170 --> 26:14.180
NHS ISN'T TELLING PEOPLE IN

26:14.200 --> 26:16.079
THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE U.K.,

26:16.099 --> 26:17.210
COME ON IN, WE'LL STICK YOUR

26:17.230 --> 26:19.009
ARM -- YOUR HALF THE COUNTRY

26:19.029 --> 26:21.059
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO GET A

26:21.079 --> 26:22.190
VACCINE, LITERALLY ACCORDING TO

26:22.210 --> 26:22.259
SURVEYS.

26:22.279 --> 26:26.220
I DON'T KNOW WHEN MY TURN COMES

26:26.240 --> 26:29.049
WHERE I'LL GET THE VACCINE.

26:29.069 --> 26:30.210
>> Bill: ONE THING WE ARE GOOD

26:30.230 --> 26:31.220
AT AND IT'S BIPARTISAN, WE ARE

26:31.240 --> 26:34.150
ABLE TO PRINT MONEY WE DON'T

26:34.170 --> 26:36.000
HAVE AND HANDED OUT TO THE NEEDY

26:36.019 --> 26:38.269
AND UNMEDIA LIKE.

26:38.289 --> 26:40.059
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT WE ARE

26:40.079 --> 26:41.240
REALLY GOOD AT, PRINTING NEW

26:41.259 --> 26:44.289
MONEY AND GIVING IT AWAY.

26:45.009 --> 26:46.180
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.029
>> ARE YOU PAUL RYAN NOW?

26:49.049 --> 26:51.089
>> Bill: IS THAT WRONG?

26:51.109 --> 26:53.109
>> I THINK IT'S WORTH BEING

26:53.130 --> 26:56.029
CONCERNED ABOUT A CIRCUMSTANCE

26:56.049 --> 26:59.049
WHERE WE'VE CREATED EFFECTIVELY

26:59.069 --> 26:59.230
AROUND $5 TRILLION OVER THE

26:59.250 --> 27:01.029
COURSE OF 11 MONTHS.

27:01.049 --> 27:02.269
IF IT'S A $20 TRILLION ECONOMY,

27:02.289 --> 27:04.140
THAT IS A BIG DEAL AND THE

27:04.160 --> 27:05.180
QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE

27:05.200 --> 27:09.220
DOING THAT IN A BIG WAY IS A BIG

27:09.240 --> 27:09.279
DEAL.

27:10.000 --> 27:10.210
>> Bill: TO ANSWER YOUR

27:10.230 --> 27:12.039
QUESTION, I'M NOT PAUL RYAN BUT

27:12.059 --> 27:13.000
IF I AGREED WITH HIM ON

27:13.019 --> 27:13.259
SOMETHING IT WOULDN'T MAKE ME A

27:13.279 --> 27:17.160
HORRIBLE PERSON.

27:17.180 --> 27:18.160
THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU

27:18.180 --> 27:19.160
SOUND LIKE SOMEONE ON THE RED

27:19.180 --> 27:21.029
TEAM YOU MUST BE WRONG.

27:21.049 --> 27:25.039
I'M JUST SAYING -- I WOULD

27:25.059 --> 27:26.150
RATHER SEE THE MONEY TARGETED

27:26.170 --> 27:27.130
MORE, I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE ARE

27:27.150 --> 27:29.170
GREAT AT TARGETING, THE ONLY

27:29.190 --> 27:31.230
THING WE CAN DO PRECISELY IS

27:31.250 --> 27:32.089
BOMB.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.119
WHEN WE WANT TO BOMB SOMETHING,

27:33.140 --> 27:37.089
THAT'S THE ONE THING --

27:37.109 --> 27:39.089
EVERYTHING ELSE IS WE SPRAY IT,

27:39.109 --> 27:41.269
WE JUST SPRAY IT AROUND.

27:41.289 --> 27:46.079
>> I TALKED TO SOME REPUBLICAN

27:46.099 --> 27:47.009
LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE

27:47.029 --> 27:48.259
YESTERDAY ABOUT THE BILL,

27:48.279 --> 27:51.279
BIDEN'S PROPOSAL, $1.9 TRILLION,

27:52.000 --> 27:57.269
REMEMBER THE STIMULUS IN 2009

27:57.289 --> 28:00.000
WAS 800 BILLION?

28:00.019 --> 28:01.150
>> Bill: AND THEY WENT BACK

28:01.170 --> 28:01.210
SHIT.

28:01.230 --> 28:04.039
>> THAT'S WHEN WE GOT THE

28:04.059 --> 28:06.190
EUPHEMISM, JOBS CREATED OR SAVED

28:06.210 --> 28:06.289
WHICH WAS FAKE.

28:07.009 --> 28:08.130
>> BIDEN PRESIDED OVER THE

28:08.150 --> 28:11.220
RECOVERY IN 2008 AND HE HAS A

28:11.240 --> 28:12.119
LOT OF IDEAS BUT THE REPUBLICAN

28:12.140 --> 28:14.279
VIEWPOINT ON THIS IN THE SENATE

28:15.000 --> 28:18.230
IS WHAT YOU GUYS ARE SAYING,

28:18.250 --> 28:19.220
CHECKS -- A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

28:19.240 --> 28:22.289
CAME OUT FOR THAT TOO THOUSAND

28:23.009 --> 28:25.109
DOLLAR CHECK, CHECKS COULD WORK,

28:25.130 --> 28:25.279
VACCINE CREATION AND

28:26.000 --> 28:28.059
DISTRIBUTION, THAT COULD WORK

28:28.079 --> 28:31.180
BUT THEY ARE BALKING AT THE IDEA

28:31.200 --> 28:32.240
THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ALLOTTED

28:32.259 --> 28:33.230
FOR TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

28:33.250 --> 28:35.089
SPENDING OVER THE LAST YEAR, WE

28:35.109 --> 28:36.279
ARE GOING TO GIVE MORE MONEY TO

28:37.000 --> 28:38.039
STATES AND THE CITIES, THEY

28:38.059 --> 28:40.180
AREN'T SURE ABOUT THAT AND THEY

28:40.200 --> 28:41.119
ALSO THINK THAT CHUCK SCHUMER

28:41.140 --> 28:43.140
AND NANCY PELOSI ARE GOING TO

28:43.160 --> 28:44.160
LARD UP THIS BILL WITH WHATEVER

28:44.180 --> 28:46.220
THEY WANT TO.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.190
>> Bill: TOM BRADY GOT MONEY

28:48.210 --> 28:51.130
THE LAST TIME AND JOEL OSTEEN

28:51.150 --> 28:53.049
AND SOME OF IT YOU CAN NEVER

28:53.069 --> 28:54.049
TRANSFER MONEY EXCEPT FOR A

28:54.069 --> 28:56.150
LEAKY BUCKET, I GET SOME OF

28:56.170 --> 28:56.289
THAT.

28:57.009 --> 28:58.170
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE DON'T DO

28:58.190 --> 29:01.160
ANYTHING WITH GREAT CARE.

29:01.180 --> 29:04.089
WHY NOT?

29:04.109 --> 29:06.069
WE ARE MAKING MONEY WITH A MINT

29:06.089 --> 29:06.140
ANYWAY.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.230
>> I THINK THE BIDEN PEOPLE SAY

29:08.250 --> 29:10.289
THIS PRIVATELY THIS IS A

29:11.009 --> 29:12.130
STARTING POINT, THERE'S GOING TO

29:12.150 --> 29:14.089
BE A NEGOTIATION AND I THINK

29:14.109 --> 29:15.269
IT'S IN BIDEN'S HEART THAT HE

29:15.289 --> 29:18.039
WANTS TO PEEL OFF SOME

29:18.059 --> 29:19.250
REPUBLICAN SENATORS.

29:19.269 --> 29:22.039
>> WRITING CHECKS IS EASY, THE

29:22.059 --> 29:23.069
REALLY HARD STUFF, THE SINGLE

29:23.089 --> 29:25.200
MOST IMPORTANT THING THEY CAN DO

29:25.220 --> 29:26.190
IS REOPEN SCHOOLS AND FOCUS LIKE

29:26.210 --> 29:29.130
A LASER ON HOW TO HELP STATES DO

29:29.150 --> 29:30.039
THAT WOULD --

29:30.059 --> 29:32.160
>> THIS MONEY FOR THAT IN THE

29:32.180 --> 29:32.240
PROPOSAL.

29:32.259 --> 29:35.140
>> IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN

29:35.160 --> 29:37.119
MONEY AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK

29:37.140 --> 29:38.009
THERE'S A LOT OF GRANDSTANDING

29:38.029 --> 29:41.269
TAKING PLACE.

29:41.289 --> 29:43.109
THE PROFOUND FAILURE OF THIS

29:43.130 --> 29:45.089
ENTIRE GOVERNMENT, THE

29:45.109 --> 29:46.119
BUREAUCRACY, DEMOCRATS AND

29:46.140 --> 29:47.140
REPUBLICANS ALIKE TO ACTUALLY

29:47.160 --> 29:49.190
RISE TO THE OCCASION AND MEET

29:49.210 --> 29:51.150
THIS CHALLENGE, THEY FAILED

29:51.170 --> 29:52.009
PROFOUNDLY.

29:52.029 --> 29:54.130
THE QUESTION OF WHAT WE DO FROM

29:54.150 --> 29:55.160
HERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

29:55.180 --> 29:56.160
QUESTION WE OUGHT TO BE

29:56.180 --> 29:58.210
PONDERING AND WE DON'T HAVE

29:58.230 --> 29:59.109
TRUMP TO KICK AROUND.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.160
>> I THINK ONE OF THE DUMBEST

30:01.180 --> 30:02.049
THINGS OF COVID GOING BACK TO

30:02.069 --> 30:05.089
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, WE THINK --

30:05.109 --> 30:07.089
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT

30:07.109 --> 30:08.119
THINK JUST BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE

30:08.140 --> 30:09.210
DOING SOMETHING OR SAYING

30:09.230 --> 30:10.240
SOMETHING IS AUTOMATICALLY

30:10.259 --> 30:12.180
CORRECT AND IF REPUBLICANS DO

30:12.200 --> 30:14.220
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY STUPID.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.269
MAYOR GARCETTI IN LOS ANGELES,

30:16.289 --> 30:19.109
GOVERNOR NEWSOM, WHY IS THE

30:19.130 --> 30:21.140
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK ANDREW

30:21.160 --> 30:22.170
CUOMO SAINT OF COVID TO?

30:22.190 --> 30:26.269
HIS TO IT -- A BOOK TOUR BEFORE

30:26.289 --> 30:27.240
THE PANDEMIC IS EVEN OVERCOME

30:27.259 --> 30:29.289
IT'S RIDICULOUS!

30:30.009 --> 30:31.029
>> Bill: RIGHT.

30:31.049 --> 30:32.039
HE PUT PEOPLE BACK IN THE

30:32.059 --> 30:34.269
NURSING HOMES, HE DID THE WRONG

30:34.289 --> 30:35.039
THING.

30:35.059 --> 30:37.150
THE IDIOT IN FLORIDA DID IT

30:37.170 --> 30:37.250
BETTER.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.099
>> HE LET HIS POLITICAL

30:39.119 --> 30:40.099
DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE MAYOR OF

30:40.119 --> 30:42.000
NEW YORK CITY GET IN THE WAY OF

30:42.019 --> 30:44.210
SWIFT AND GOOD DECISION-MAKING

30:44.230 --> 30:47.029
AND HE'S HELD UP AS A PARAGON OF

30:47.049 --> 30:48.160
GOOD GOVERNANCE BECAUSE HE'S A

30:48.180 --> 30:48.259
DEMOCRAT TO.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.150
>> Bill: IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A

30:50.170 --> 30:51.230
NEW PRESIDENT, NOT JUST BECAUSE

30:51.250 --> 30:53.269
THE LAST ONE WAS THE WORST

30:53.289 --> 30:55.049
PERSON IN THE WORLD, BUT FOR

30:55.069 --> 30:57.220
COMEDY -- WE NEED NEW COMEDY.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.279
I WAS WATCHING THE INAUGURATION,

30:59.000 --> 31:00.200
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF LET'S

31:00.220 --> 31:04.150
JUST START RIGHT HERE.

31:04.170 --> 31:05.230
I WAS LOOKING AT JOE BIDEN AND

31:05.250 --> 31:06.180
IT LOOKED LIKE HIS MIND WAS

31:06.200 --> 31:09.109
DRIFTING AT TIMES AND I THOUGHT

31:09.130 --> 31:11.210
I THINK I CAN READ THIS MAN'S

31:11.230 --> 31:14.160
MIND -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR

31:14.180 --> 31:14.250
IT?

31:14.269 --> 31:15.039
[APPLAUSE]

31:15.059 --> 31:17.220
OH SURE, NOW.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.039
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

31:20.059 --> 31:22.160
GOING THROUGH HIS MIND.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.069
J-LO?

31:23.089 --> 31:24.039
I THOUGHT THEY SAID WE WERE

31:24.059 --> 31:27.259
HAVING JELL-O.

31:27.279 --> 31:28.190
NOT BAD FOR A KID FROM ANCIENT

31:28.210 --> 31:32.059
ROME.

31:32.079 --> 31:32.140
[LAUGHTER]

31:32.160 --> 31:32.259
UH-OH.

31:32.279 --> 31:35.130
I HOPE THAT WAS JUST GAS.

31:35.150 --> 31:35.210
[LAUGHTER]

31:35.230 --> 31:36.130
[APPLAUSE]

31:36.150 --> 31:37.150
I SEE LADY GAGA, BUT WHERE'S

31:37.170 --> 31:40.289
LORD GAGA?

31:41.009 --> 31:46.259
I AM SO GETTING LAID TONIGHT.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.039
[LAUGHTER]

31:47.059 --> 31:49.130
[APPLAUSE]

31:49.150 --> 31:57.170
WHO'S SLEEPY NOW, FUCK-FACE?

31:57.190 --> 31:58.230
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

31:58.250 --> 32:00.289
LET'S GET BACK ON THE DISCUSSION

32:01.009 --> 32:02.240
OF THE ECONOMY, YOU HAVE BEEN

32:02.259 --> 32:06.240
CRITICAL OF BLACK LIVES MATTER

32:06.259 --> 32:11.150
RELATIONS WITH COMMUNISM AND

32:11.170 --> 32:12.279
ANTICAPITALISM, THERE IS A NEW

32:13.000 --> 32:13.220
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONGRESSMAN WHO

32:13.240 --> 32:16.069
SAID CAPITALISM IS THE NEW

32:16.089 --> 32:19.230
SLAVERY.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.289
TALKING ABOUT A BLACK LIVES

32:21.009 --> 32:22.079
MATTER, YOU SAID "THEY ARE PART

32:22.099 --> 32:24.059
OF A BROADER PROGRAM THAT IS

32:24.079 --> 32:26.289
HOSTILE TOWARDS FREE MARKETS AND

32:27.009 --> 32:27.190
CAPITALISM, HOSTILE TOWARDS

32:27.210 --> 32:30.039
NOTIONS OF INDIVIDUALISM AND THE

32:30.059 --> 32:30.240
SCIENTIFIC METHOD."

32:30.259 --> 32:31.190
GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT

32:31.210 --> 32:34.079
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:34.099 --> 32:35.150
>> THE IMPORTANT THING TO

32:35.170 --> 32:36.190
CONSIDER IS ONE FOLKS TALK ABOUT

32:36.210 --> 32:37.190
BLACK LIVES MATTER IT'S OFTEN

32:37.210 --> 32:39.089
SAID THIS IS AN ETHICAL

32:39.109 --> 32:39.240
STATEMENT, IF YOU CAN'T

32:39.259 --> 32:42.170
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS, THAT'S A REAL

32:42.190 --> 32:42.240
PROBLEM.

32:42.259 --> 32:43.230
BLACK LIVES MATTER IS A

32:43.250 --> 32:45.059
POLITICAL STATEMENT AND THERE'S

32:45.079 --> 32:46.109
A POLITICAL PROGRAM ATTACHED TO

32:46.130 --> 32:48.220
IT AND PLENTY OF PEOPLE BROADLY

32:48.240 --> 32:50.079
MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IT BUT THE

32:50.099 --> 32:51.230
FACT IT DOES HAVE SOME ROOTS IN

32:51.250 --> 32:54.109
MARXISM, THERE ARE RADICAL

32:54.130 --> 32:56.119
ELEMENTS OF THE BLACK LIVES

32:56.140 --> 32:58.109
MATTER MOVEMENT THAT ARE VERY

32:58.130 --> 32:59.009
DISINCLINED TOWARDS FREE MARKETS

32:59.029 --> 33:02.250
AND CAPITALISM THAT CHALLENGE

33:02.269 --> 33:04.130
BASIC NOTIONS THAT I THINK ARE

33:04.150 --> 33:06.240
BROADLY SHARED BY AMERICANS

33:06.259 --> 33:09.109
ABOUT EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW.

33:09.130 --> 33:12.210
THIS PIVOT TOWARDS EQUITY AND IT

33:12.230 --> 33:14.019
FOCUSES DISPROPORTIONATELY ON

33:14.039 --> 33:15.170
OUTCOMES IS SOMETHING THAT IS

33:15.190 --> 33:16.180
RATHER NEW BUT SEEMS TO HAVE

33:16.200 --> 33:19.259
TAKEN THE COUNTRY BY STORM, THE

33:19.279 --> 33:21.240
ONLY THING PEOPLE CAN TALK

33:21.259 --> 33:22.099
ABOUT.

33:22.119 --> 33:24.079
>> Bill: EQUITY AS OPPOSED TO

33:24.099 --> 33:24.170
A QUALITY.

33:24.190 --> 33:27.039
>> I CAN GIVE YOU A PRACTICAL

33:27.059 --> 33:27.230
EXAMPLE OF THAT.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.160
COVID WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT

33:29.180 --> 33:31.220
A MOMENT AGO, WE KNOW THE MOST

33:31.240 --> 33:33.039
VULNERABLE POPULATION WHEN IT

33:33.059 --> 33:34.170
COMES TO COVID ARE OLDER PEOPLE,

33:34.190 --> 33:36.180
IF I TOOK PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF

33:36.200 --> 33:40.000
55, THAT'S 80% OF THE DEATHS.

33:40.019 --> 33:44.079
THERE HAVE BEEN ACTUAL

33:44.099 --> 33:44.279
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PRIORITIZING

33:45.000 --> 33:47.029
PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR

33:47.049 --> 33:48.190
RACE BECAUSE COVID IS SAID TO

33:48.210 --> 33:49.109
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT BLACK

33:49.130 --> 33:51.269
PEOPLE RELATIVE TO WHITE PEOPLE.

33:51.289 --> 33:53.029
IT IS A RIDICULOUS PROPOSITION

33:53.049 --> 33:54.119
BUT IT'S A PROPOSITION THAT

33:54.140 --> 33:56.069
FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE MOUTHS OF

33:56.089 --> 33:57.160
GOVERNORS IN CALIFORNIA, THE

33:57.180 --> 34:01.210
PAGES OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES."

34:01.230 --> 34:03.200
>> WHY IS THAT RIDICULOUS?

34:03.220 --> 34:05.289
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GLOBAL

34:06.009 --> 34:07.079
IMPACT OF COVID IN THE

34:07.099 --> 34:08.219
UNITED STATES, 80% OF PEOPLE WHO

34:08.239 --> 34:10.119
ARE DYING ARE OLDER, 18% OF THE

34:10.139 --> 34:13.079
PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING ARE BLACK.

34:13.099 --> 34:14.199
A LIFE LOST TO COVID IS A LIFE

34:14.219 --> 34:17.019
THAT MATTERS AND WE CAN FOCUS ON

34:17.039 --> 34:17.179
PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE

34:17.199 --> 34:19.269
WITHOUT MAKING THIS ABOUT RACE.

34:19.289 --> 34:20.159
MAKING IT ABOUT RACE ONLY

34:20.179 --> 34:24.019
OBSCURES THE ACTUAL ISSUE.

34:24.039 --> 34:26.110
>> IF YOU SEPARATE RACE FROM

34:26.130 --> 34:29.070
ECONOMIC INSECURITY, SURE.

34:29.090 --> 34:30.210
HISPANICS ARE HOSPITALIZED AT

34:30.230 --> 34:31.289
THREE, FOUR TIMES THE RATE OF

34:32.010 --> 34:34.090
WHITE PEOPLE FOR A VARIETY OF

34:34.110 --> 34:35.019
REASONS.

34:35.039 --> 34:35.250
THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS,

34:35.269 --> 34:39.030
THEY'RE RIDING THE BUS.

34:39.050 --> 34:40.260
>> THE IMPORTANT POINT IS IT'S

34:40.280 --> 34:42.079
NOT FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT RACE,

34:42.099 --> 34:43.179
THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT ISSUES IN

34:43.199 --> 34:46.210
THEIR COMMUNITIES, THEY LIVE IN

34:46.230 --> 34:49.039
HOMES WITH MORE PEOPLE, THEY

34:49.059 --> 34:51.030
LIVE IN MORE URBAN CENTERS, IF

34:51.050 --> 34:52.179
THAT'S THE CASE THE POLICY YOU

34:52.199 --> 34:54.269
ARE TAILORING IS FOR PEOPLE IN

34:54.289 --> 34:56.130
URBAN CENTERS, NOT LATINOS.

34:56.150 --> 34:57.260
THIS IS A CONFUSION OF

34:57.280 --> 34:59.219
CATEGORIES THAT IS ACTUALLY

34:59.239 --> 35:01.230
DISTRACTING US FROM FORGING GOOD

35:01.250 --> 35:02.139
POLICY.

35:02.159 --> 35:03.280
WHAT YOU GET IS GREAT SOUND

35:04.000 --> 35:05.119
BITES COME YOU DON'T ACTUALLY

35:05.139 --> 35:05.219
FIX PROBLEMS.

35:05.239 --> 35:11.079
[APPLAUSE]

35:11.099 --> 35:12.150
>> Bill: SOMETHING HAPPENED

35:12.170 --> 35:14.019
WITH WHITE PEOPLE, WHITE

35:14.039 --> 35:16.139
LIBERALS, A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF

35:16.159 --> 35:17.030
THEM REVELING IN GUILT THAT I

35:17.050 --> 35:19.269
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:19.289 --> 35:22.010
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A GOOD

35:22.030 --> 35:24.289
ISSUE YOU CHOSE TO USE AS AN

35:25.010 --> 35:28.210
EXAMPLE BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT, I

35:28.230 --> 35:31.170
THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATS,

35:31.190 --> 35:32.230
IT DOES DISPROPORTIONATELY

35:32.250 --> 35:33.190
AFFECT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

35:33.210 --> 35:35.079
COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE THE WHITE

35:35.099 --> 35:36.210
PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEIR

35:36.230 --> 35:39.210
GUILT, YOU ONLY HEAR ABOUT IT

35:39.230 --> 35:41.039
BECAUSE OF RACISM, THAT IS A

35:41.059 --> 35:42.250
PART OF IT, ANOTHER PART OF IT

35:42.269 --> 35:44.019
IS OBESITY, NOT THAT THERE

35:44.039 --> 35:46.039
AREN'T PLENTY OF FAT WHITE

35:46.059 --> 35:46.110
PEOPLE.

35:46.130 --> 35:50.250
ANOTHER PART OF IT IS VITAMIN D,

35:50.269 --> 35:52.280
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.019
MY PASTY WHITE SKIN ABSORBS IT

35:54.039 --> 35:56.000
EASILY, YOURS DOES NOT.

35:56.019 --> 36:00.030
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.

36:00.050 --> 36:01.250
IT DOESN'T FIT THE PARADIGM OF

36:01.269 --> 36:04.139
THIS IS A RACIST PLOT.

36:04.159 --> 36:07.070
>> GEOGRAPHY IS A HUGE PART OF

36:07.090 --> 36:07.269
IT.

36:07.289 --> 36:09.130
>> Bill: SOMETIMES BECAUSE

36:09.150 --> 36:09.239
THEY ARE POOR.

36:09.260 --> 36:11.150
>> IF WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE

36:11.170 --> 36:14.050
DATA POINTS WITH RESPECT --

36:14.070 --> 36:15.269
WHERE DO BLACK PEOPLE LIVE, DO

36:15.289 --> 36:17.099
THEY LIVE IN URBAN AREAS?

36:17.119 --> 36:18.150
BLACK PEOPLE RELATIVE TO WHERE

36:18.170 --> 36:22.000
THEY LIVE AND RELATIVE TO COVID

36:22.019 --> 36:24.030
IMPACT MAY NOT BE SO

36:24.050 --> 36:24.150
DISPROPORTIONATE.

36:24.170 --> 36:26.150
>> LET IT BE STIPULATED,

36:26.170 --> 36:27.199
COLLEGE-EDUCATED WHITE PEOPLE ON

36:27.219 --> 36:28.289
THE INTERNET PROFESSING THEIR

36:29.010 --> 36:30.150
WHITE GUILT AND DISPLAYING THEIR

36:30.170 --> 36:32.289
VIRTUE ARE SOME OF THE WORST

36:33.010 --> 36:35.019
PEOPLE IN POLITICS AND ARE

36:35.039 --> 36:38.019
RUINING POLITICS.

36:38.039 --> 36:39.250
[APPLAUSE]

36:39.269 --> 36:40.199
HOWEVER, THIS IS ABOUT SHARED

36:40.219 --> 36:42.260
SACRIFICE I THINK.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.170
HEAR ME OUT ON THIS.

36:44.190 --> 36:46.230
I AM WHITE GUY WHO HAS INCOME

36:46.250 --> 36:47.219
AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE.

36:47.239 --> 36:50.039
I AM ALSO WHITE GUY WHO REALLY

36:50.059 --> 36:53.030
WANTS TO FUCKING GO TO A BAR, TO

36:53.050 --> 36:54.150
GO TO CONCERTS, TO GO TO

36:54.170 --> 36:57.139
RESTAURANTS AND IF WE VACCINATE

36:57.159 --> 36:59.190
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

36:59.210 --> 37:02.099
HEALTH CARE FIRST, MAYBE THAT

37:02.119 --> 37:03.170
BRINGS HOSPITALIZATION RATES

37:03.190 --> 37:05.219
DOWN, MAYBE WE CAN THEN GO BACK

37:05.239 --> 37:06.280
TO FUCKING INDOOR DINING.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.059
MAYBE I'M BEING SELFISH HERE.

37:10.079 --> 37:12.179
>> I DON'T ACTUALLY SEE HOW THAT

37:12.199 --> 37:14.059
COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE

37:14.079 --> 37:15.139
THAN TARGETING THE PEOPLE WHO

37:15.159 --> 37:17.179
ARE MOST VULNERABLE WITH

37:17.199 --> 37:17.260
VACCINES.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.199
WE ALREADY KNOW WE CAN FIND WAYS

37:19.219 --> 37:22.219
TO LIVE WITH THE VIRUS.

37:22.239 --> 37:25.019
>> BLACK AND HISPANIC PEOPLE ARE

37:25.039 --> 37:25.119
VULNERABLE.

37:25.139 --> 37:27.050
>> THEY ARE NOT MORE VULNERABLE

37:27.070 --> 37:30.010
BECAUSE OF THEIR BLACKNESS OR

37:30.030 --> 37:34.110
LATINONESS.

37:34.130 --> 37:35.289
>> Bill: LET ME GIVE YOU AN

37:36.010 --> 37:37.099
EXAMPLE, LAST WEEK WE WERE

37:37.119 --> 37:40.090
TALKING ABOUT THE MEDIA, IT'S A

37:40.110 --> 37:42.190
DIFFERENT KIND OF MEDIA THAT WAS

37:42.210 --> 37:49.030
TEN YEARS AGO, EVERY STORY HAS

37:49.050 --> 37:50.019
TO BE INTERPRETED BY HOW IS MY

37:50.039 --> 37:52.139
DEMOGRAPHIC GOING TO LIKE THIS.

37:52.159 --> 37:53.059
WE FOUND OUT TRUMPETED BETTER

37:53.079 --> 37:57.039
WITH MINORITIES THAN OTHER

37:57.059 --> 37:58.139
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, YOU WOULD

37:58.159 --> 37:59.079
NEVER HEAR THEM TALK ABOUT THIS

37:59.099 --> 38:01.099
ON MSNBC.

38:01.119 --> 38:03.269
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE YOU ON.

38:03.289 --> 38:09.210
>> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

38:09.230 --> 38:11.019
>> Bill: IT'S A DIFFERENT

38:11.039 --> 38:11.260
POINT OF VIEW THAT GETS ON THE

38:11.280 --> 38:13.190
BUBBLE THAT MAKES THEM TURN THE

38:13.210 --> 38:14.110
DIAL TO ANOTHER CHANNEL BUT WHAT

38:14.130 --> 38:18.260
IS YOUR VIEW ON THAT?

38:18.280 --> 38:20.260
>> I THINK SOME OF THE REPORTING

38:20.280 --> 38:21.090
AFTER THE ELECTION.

38:21.110 --> 38:31.079
>> DON'T SPLAIN WHITE.

38:31.099 --> 38:31.210
I'M KIDDING!

38:31.230 --> 38:32.039
IT'S A JOKE.

38:32.059 --> 38:33.170
>> Bill: WHAT A BAD MOMENT FOR

38:33.190 --> 38:36.280
THE WHITE GUY TO INTERRUPT.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.199
>> I'M SORRY, COME DOWN OVER

38:39.219 --> 38:40.119
THERE.

38:40.139 --> 38:41.230
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S UNRELATED

38:41.250 --> 38:43.110
TO WHAT I WAS HINTING AT BEFORE,

38:43.130 --> 38:46.260
I THINK THERE WAS A GENERAL

38:46.280 --> 38:47.250
DISSATISFACTION, I THINK MOST

38:47.269 --> 38:49.179
PEOPLE AREN'T VOTING IN FAVOR OF

38:49.199 --> 38:51.070
THINGS, THEIR VOTING AGAINST

38:51.090 --> 38:54.019
THINGS, PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN

38:54.039 --> 38:55.210
WAITING AROUND FOR 50 ODD YEARS

38:55.230 --> 38:56.119
THAT JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN IN

38:56.139 --> 38:58.019
PUBLIC LIFE, YOU KNOW WHO WE

38:58.039 --> 38:59.280
NEED AS PRESIDENT MORE THAN

39:00.000 --> 39:01.010
ANYBODY IN THE WORLD?

39:01.030 --> 39:03.019
SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, THAT'S A GUY

39:03.039 --> 39:04.250
WE NEED.

39:04.269 --> 39:06.079
JOE BIDEN ARRIVED AT THE RIGHT

39:06.099 --> 39:08.099
TIME AND MR. MAGOOED HIS WAY

39:08.119 --> 39:10.019
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AGAINST ONE

39:10.039 --> 39:11.019
OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR HUMANS ON

39:11.039 --> 39:11.079
EARTH.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.280
>> Bill: THIS IS WHAT I'VE

39:13.000 --> 39:14.119
ALWAYS SAID, FORGIVE ME IF I

39:14.139 --> 39:15.099
REPEATING THIS BUT TO ME THE

39:15.119 --> 39:19.019
ULTIMATE WHITE PRIVILEGE, YOU

39:19.039 --> 39:19.269
KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY?

39:19.289 --> 39:23.019
>> NO.

39:23.039 --> 39:25.199
>> Bill: IS BEING ABLE TO BE

39:25.219 --> 39:26.199
IMPRACTICAL.

39:26.219 --> 39:28.090
BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO BE

39:28.110 --> 39:29.119
PRACTICAL, RIGHT?

39:29.139 --> 39:31.159
THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY.

39:31.179 --> 39:33.019
>> SOMETIMES I CAN BE

39:33.039 --> 39:33.110
IMPRACTICAL.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.150
>> Bill: RIGHT, I'M SAYING IN

39:34.170 --> 39:35.239
GENERAL AND POLITICALLY YOU SEE

39:35.260 --> 39:39.150
THAT ALL THE TIME, THEY WERE

39:39.170 --> 39:41.000
VERY PRACTICAL ABOUT JOE BIDEN.

39:41.019 --> 39:41.239
IT WASN'T WHO THEY LOVE, IT WAS

39:41.260 --> 39:45.090
WHO WAS POSSIBLE.

39:45.110 --> 39:46.090
>> THEY GOT LUCKY AND DODGED A

39:46.110 --> 39:48.170
BIT OF A BULLET, THE NUMBERS

39:48.190 --> 39:49.170
WERE HUGE FOR EVERYBODY ACROSS

39:49.190 --> 39:49.250
THE BOARD.

39:49.269 --> 39:51.219
>> ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT,

39:51.239 --> 39:52.269
SOME OF THE REASONS TRUMP DID

39:52.289 --> 39:56.159
WELL AMONG HISPANICS AND THIS

39:56.179 --> 39:58.010
WAS REPORTED THROUGHOUT THE

39:58.030 --> 39:59.079
RIO GRANDE VALLEY IN TEXAS,

39:59.099 --> 40:01.000
TRUMP OUTRAN BIDEN BY

40:01.019 --> 40:02.059
SIGNIFICANT MARGIN COMPARED TO

40:02.079 --> 40:04.110
LAST ELECTION, THEY LIKE THE

40:04.130 --> 40:04.179
CHECKS!

40:04.199 --> 40:06.159
THEY LIKE THE CHECKS SIGNED BY

40:06.179 --> 40:07.050
DONALD TRUMP THAT CAME THROUGH

40:07.070 --> 40:09.280
AFTER THE LAST COVID BILL.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.019
TRUMP IF HE HAD UNDERSTOOD

40:12.039 --> 40:13.019
BETTER THE TRANSACTIONAL NATURE

40:13.039 --> 40:14.150
OF POLITICS AND GOVERNING MIGHT

40:14.170 --> 40:16.050
HAVE WON IF HE HAD REALLY

40:16.070 --> 40:18.150
FOCUSED ON THAT.

40:18.170 --> 40:20.030
THAT'S PRACTICALITY, THEY ARE

40:20.050 --> 40:20.199
LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

40:20.219 --> 40:21.210
GOVERNMENT DOES FOR ME BUT IF

40:21.230 --> 40:23.030
I'M GETTING A CHECK FOR THIS

40:23.050 --> 40:25.110
GUY, SHIT, I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR

40:25.130 --> 40:26.030
HIM.

40:26.050 --> 40:27.210
THAT'S POWERFUL, HIS NUMBERS ON

40:27.230 --> 40:28.219
THE ECONOMY THROUGHOUT THE

40:28.239 --> 40:29.079
CAMPAIGN WERE PRETTY GOOD

40:29.099 --> 40:30.190
COMPARED TO THE REST OF HIS POLL

40:30.210 --> 40:32.250
NUMBERS WHICH ARE IN THE

40:32.269 --> 40:33.019
SHITTER.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.030
>> Bill: AM I WRONG TO NOT

40:34.050 --> 40:37.050
WANT TO SEE RACE ALL THE TIME?

40:37.070 --> 40:38.210
THAT'S HOW I WAS BROUGHT UP.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.000
THAT'S WHAT A GOOD LIBERAL DOES

40:40.019 --> 40:43.079
IS YOU DON'T SEE RACE AND NOW

40:43.099 --> 40:43.269
THEY SWITCHED IT ALL AROUND AND

40:43.289 --> 40:44.179
I'M BAD BECAUSE I DON'T SEE IT

40:44.199 --> 40:49.150
ALL THE TIME.

40:49.170 --> 40:51.039
HIS UBIQUITY EVEN EFFECTIVE TO

40:51.059 --> 40:51.260
MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE

40:51.280 --> 40:53.099
AT EVERY TURN?

40:53.119 --> 40:55.110
>> ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT

40:55.130 --> 40:58.030
BY THE ADMINISTRATION DID IS GOT

40:58.050 --> 40:58.210
RID OF THESE PROHIBITIONS OF

40:58.230 --> 41:00.179
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PUT ON

41:00.199 --> 41:01.150
THIS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

41:01.170 --> 41:03.199
TRAINING AND ONE THING THAT WE

41:03.219 --> 41:04.230
KNOW AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE WHEN

41:04.250 --> 41:06.119
I HAVE TO AGREE WITH

41:06.139 --> 41:07.219
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE IT'S VERY

41:07.239 --> 41:09.079
UNPOPULAR TO DO IN MANY CIRCLES

41:09.099 --> 41:10.150
BUT ONE THING WE HAVE TO

41:10.170 --> 41:11.280
ACKNOWLEDGE IS THIS DIVERSITY

41:12.000 --> 41:13.199
AND INCLUSION TRAINING CAN OFTEN

41:13.219 --> 41:16.010
INCREASE PEOPLE'S RATION

41:16.030 --> 41:21.199
SRACIALSENSITIVITY, TALKING OFTT

41:21.219 --> 41:22.260
RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION CAN

41:22.280 --> 41:24.090
MAKE PEOPLE PRESUME IT EXISTS

41:24.110 --> 41:26.079
AND PLACES IT DOES NOT AND WE

41:26.099 --> 41:28.099
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE RACISM IS A

41:28.119 --> 41:31.010
SUBJECTIVE ALLEGATION.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.099
I CAN PRESUME INTENT ON YOUR

41:32.119 --> 41:33.280
BEHALF WHETHER OR NOT IT IS

41:34.000 --> 41:35.250
ACTUALLY THERE AND THAT IS A

41:35.269 --> 41:36.260
MAJOR DEFECT AND I DON'T WANT TO

41:36.280 --> 41:38.190
BE THE OBJECT OF YOUR SPECIAL

41:38.210 --> 41:38.260
CONCERN.

41:38.280 --> 41:42.090
>> Bill: RIGHT.

41:42.110 --> 41:45.159
>> THIS IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

41:45.179 --> 41:46.019
[APPLAUSE]

41:46.039 --> 41:47.210
>> Bill: I'M SO SYMPATHETIC TO

41:47.230 --> 41:49.030
THE CAUSE BUT DON'T GASLIGHT ME

41:49.050 --> 41:50.199
AND THIS IS WHAT I HEAR

41:50.219 --> 41:51.139
PRIVATELY FROM MY BLACK FRIENDS

41:51.159 --> 41:53.150
COME I DON'T WANT TO BE THE

41:53.170 --> 41:54.210
FOCAL POINT, I JUST WANT TO

41:54.230 --> 41:54.289
BLEND IN.

41:55.010 --> 41:57.030
I WANT TO HAVE A BEER LIKE YOU,

41:57.050 --> 41:58.110
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE I HAVE TO

41:58.130 --> 41:59.269
MAKE A SPEECH ABOUT IT OR THAT

41:59.289 --> 42:02.219
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SPEECH ABOUT

42:02.239 --> 42:03.119
IT.

42:03.139 --> 42:06.239
LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION, IS

42:06.260 --> 42:09.010
THE PICTURE OF AMERICA THAT IS

42:09.030 --> 42:12.179
PRESENTED BY THE RADICALS I

42:12.199 --> 42:15.059
WOULD SAY, BLACK LIVES MATTER

42:15.079 --> 42:17.110
SOME OF THEM, ANTIRACIST OF

42:17.130 --> 42:20.059
AMERICA 2021, IS IT AN ACCURATE

42:20.079 --> 42:21.280
PICTURE?

42:22.000 --> 42:23.139
SOMETIMES IN LIKE ARE THEY

42:23.159 --> 42:25.030
TALKING ABOUT 2021?

42:25.050 --> 42:26.130
>> I DON'T THINK SO, I THINK

42:26.150 --> 42:30.039
THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES, WE

42:30.059 --> 42:31.199
COULD TALK A LOT ABOUT CRIMINAL

42:31.219 --> 42:32.250
JUSTICE REFORM OR WE TRAFFIC IN

42:32.269 --> 42:35.190
A GREAT DEAL OF HYPERBOLE,

42:35.210 --> 42:37.139
PEOPLE WHO QUITE FRANKLY DO NOT

42:37.159 --> 42:38.210
HAVE SERIOUS GROUNDING IN THESE

42:38.230 --> 42:40.179
ISSUES ARE OUT IN THE STREETS

42:40.199 --> 42:41.179
SCREAMING ABOUT THEM, THEY'VE

42:41.199 --> 42:42.289
GOT THE BULLHORN IN THEIR HANDS

42:43.010 --> 42:45.000
AND THEY DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS.

42:45.019 --> 42:46.210
I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED WHEN I SEE

42:46.230 --> 42:47.210
OUTRAGE IN PORTLAND OVER THESE

42:47.230 --> 42:50.139
ISSUES AND I GO BACK AND LOOK AT

42:50.159 --> 42:51.230
THE NUMBER OF POLICE INVOLVED

42:51.250 --> 42:52.239
SHOOTINGS OR DEATHS IN CUSTODY

42:52.260 --> 42:54.289
IN THE NUMBERS SIMPLY DO NOT

42:55.010 --> 42:57.010
BEAR OUT THIS GENOCIDE AGAINST

42:57.030 --> 42:57.210
BLACK AMERICA.

42:57.230 --> 42:59.130
IT'S NOT A THING, WHAT WE DO

42:59.150 --> 43:01.250
KNOW IS WE NEED CRIMINAL JUSTICE

43:01.269 --> 43:03.090
REFORM BUT IT'S BECAUSE THERE

43:03.110 --> 43:05.039
ARE GENUINE IMPACTS ACROSS THE

43:05.059 --> 43:06.179
BOARD IN MANY INSTANCES AND A

43:06.199 --> 43:08.280
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND

43:09.000 --> 43:10.010
TRANSPARENCY.

43:10.030 --> 43:10.199
THOSE SMART POLICIES DON'T

43:10.219 --> 43:13.070
REQUIRE US TO THINK IN TERMS OF

43:13.090 --> 43:13.139
RACISM.

43:13.159 --> 43:15.079
>> Bill: I FEEL LIKE ALL THIS

43:15.099 --> 43:16.199
ENERGY GOES TOWARDS THIS

43:16.219 --> 43:18.130
EMOTIONAL PART INSTEAD OF -- OF

43:18.150 --> 43:19.019
COURSE THERE IS SYSTEMIC RACISM

43:19.039 --> 43:21.110
IN AMERICA.

43:21.130 --> 43:24.130
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATS OF

43:24.150 --> 43:27.199
BLACK WEALTH VERSUS WHITE WELL

43:27.219 --> 43:28.199
FOR HEALTH CARE, YOU'RE TALKING

43:28.219 --> 43:30.090
ABOUT HOW LONG PEOPLE LIVE.

43:30.110 --> 43:31.210
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS YOU CAN

43:31.230 --> 43:33.269
LOOK AT, HE WOULD SAY OBVIOUSLY

43:33.289 --> 43:36.090
IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS SORRY

43:36.110 --> 43:37.010
HISTORY WHICH HAS CONTINUED TO

43:37.030 --> 43:40.039
THE PRESENT BUT WHEN I LOOK AT

43:40.059 --> 43:42.010
THE PRESENT AND VERY OFTEN

43:42.030 --> 43:45.099
ASKING THE QUESTION ARE WE NOT

43:45.119 --> 43:46.289
ADDRESSING WHAT SHOULD BE THE

43:47.010 --> 43:48.250
DRUG WAR -- GET RID OF THE DRUG

43:48.269 --> 43:50.179
WAR AND WOULDN'T YOU GET RID OF

43:50.199 --> 43:54.070
A LOT OF THE BLACK DEATHS -- WHO

43:54.090 --> 43:55.030
DIES IN CHICAGO?

43:55.050 --> 43:57.010
IS IT MOSTLY BLACKS AT THE HANDS

43:57.030 --> 43:59.150
OF POLICE?

43:59.170 --> 44:00.110
ITS GANGS FIGHTING EACH OTHER

44:00.130 --> 44:05.090
OVER DRUG TURF.

44:05.110 --> 44:06.150
CONTRACEPTION, RETRAINING THE

44:06.170 --> 44:06.289
COPS.

44:07.010 --> 44:09.000
I FEEL LIKE THE PRACTICAL

44:09.019 --> 44:10.260
PROGRAMS GET LOST BECAUSE AS YOU

44:10.280 --> 44:12.039
SAY IT DOESN'T GET THE

44:12.059 --> 44:13.000
HEADLINES.

44:13.019 --> 44:15.059
>> I THINK BIDEN DESERVES MORE

44:15.079 --> 44:17.059
CREDIT ON THIS STUFF,

44:17.079 --> 44:18.139
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED IN

44:18.159 --> 44:19.269
MEETINGS WITH STAFFERS,

44:19.289 --> 44:20.219
PARTICULARLY YOUNGER STAFFERS

44:20.239 --> 44:22.059
WHO TRAFFIC AND A LOT OF STUFF

44:22.079 --> 44:23.230
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, ACADEMIC

44:23.250 --> 44:28.159
LANGUAGE -- WHEN THEY USE

44:28.179 --> 44:30.260
ACADEMIC LANGUAGE, BIDEN STOPS

44:30.280 --> 44:31.199
THEM AND SAYS PICK UP THE PHONE

44:31.219 --> 44:34.010
AND CALL YOUR GRANDMA.

44:34.030 --> 44:37.179
IF SHE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

44:37.199 --> 44:41.250
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, TRY AGAIN.

44:41.269 --> 44:44.130
HIS NORTHSTAR HAS BEEN THE

44:44.150 --> 44:46.019
NORMAL NOT ONLINE VOTER, A BLACK

44:46.039 --> 44:47.250
PERSON OVER 50, A WHITE PERSON

44:47.269 --> 44:49.090
IN THE SUBURBS WHO ISN'T

44:49.110 --> 44:51.150
FOLLOWING THIS STUFF AND HE IS

44:51.170 --> 44:52.050
REASONABLY CAREFUL ABOUT THE

44:52.070 --> 44:54.260
RACIAL LANGUAGE THAT WE SEE

44:54.280 --> 44:57.010
PEOPLE GET MAD ABOUT ON THE

44:57.030 --> 44:57.090
INTERNET.

44:57.110 --> 44:58.250
PARTIALLY BECAUSE HE IS NOT ON

44:58.269 --> 44:59.159
THE INTERNET.

44:59.179 --> 45:01.030
>> WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT DAYS

45:01.050 --> 45:03.070
FOLKS WHO ARE PART OF TEAM BIDEN

45:03.090 --> 45:04.269
SAY THINGS ALONG THE LINES OF

45:04.289 --> 45:05.269
RACE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ARE

45:05.289 --> 45:07.210
GOING TO BE IN EVERY ASPECT OF

45:07.230 --> 45:09.179
POLICY THAT WE DO, EVERY

45:09.199 --> 45:11.139
ECONOMIC POLICY, THIS IS GOING

45:11.159 --> 45:12.090
TO BE OUR LODESTONE AND THAT

45:12.110 --> 45:13.230
SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF A

45:13.250 --> 45:14.199
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE WHICH WE

45:14.219 --> 45:15.219
MAY HAVE TO EDUCATE AND I

45:15.239 --> 45:17.190
SUSPECT WELL BUT TWO, IT DOESN'T

45:17.210 --> 45:20.030
SOUND EFFECTIVE TO ME.

45:20.050 --> 45:22.190
IF YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON REALLY

45:22.210 --> 45:23.230
COMPLICATED PROBLEMS LIKE

45:23.250 --> 45:27.019
EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, THOSE

45:27.039 --> 45:28.260
PROBLEMS ARE NOT THINGS THAT WE

45:28.280 --> 45:30.130
GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF THAT WE

45:30.150 --> 45:32.280
SEE BETTER WHEN WE INJECT RACE

45:33.000 --> 45:34.079
INTO THE CONVERSATION.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.139
RACE IS DIVISIVE, IT DIVIDES US

45:35.159 --> 45:38.210
AND OBSCURES THE TRUTH.

45:38.230 --> 45:40.250
>> Bill: IT DOESN'T MATTER IN

45:40.269 --> 45:41.119
THOSE CONVERSATIONS OFTEN.

45:41.139 --> 45:44.079
YOU ARE SAYING -- ISN'T THAT

45:44.099 --> 45:45.179
WHAT CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS?

45:45.199 --> 45:49.130
>> IS PERFORMATIVE AND SYSTEMIC

45:49.150 --> 45:53.070
RACISM IS A PHRASE THAT I FIND

45:53.090 --> 45:55.079
IT FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT

45:55.099 --> 45:56.039
CATEGORIZES THINGS BUT IT

45:56.059 --> 45:58.130
DOESN'T REALLY EXPLAIN THEM.

45:58.150 --> 46:00.110
IT DOESN'T GIVE US A SENSE OF

46:00.130 --> 46:02.000
HOW TO FIX THEM ANY MATERIAL

46:02.019 --> 46:04.010
SENSE, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF

46:04.030 --> 46:05.050
DISPARITIES AND THEY EXIST FOR

46:05.070 --> 46:07.059
ALL SORTS OF COMPLICATED REASONS

46:07.079 --> 46:08.090
AND WE IGNORE THAT.

46:08.110 --> 46:10.130
>> Bill: ALL SORTS OF WAYS YOU

46:10.150 --> 46:12.079
CAN BE DISADVANTAGED IN LIFE.

46:12.099 --> 46:13.269
>> AND ADVANTAGED.

46:13.289 --> 46:15.269
I AM PRIVILEGED, ANYONE WHO

46:15.289 --> 46:16.289
LOOKS AT ME AND PRESUMES I AM

46:17.010 --> 46:21.170
DISADVANTAGE IS A FOOL.

46:33.010 --> 46:34.190
POOR BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK AND

46:34.210 --> 46:35.289
THERE'S A HISTORY OF RAGING

46:36.010 --> 46:36.059
RACISM.

ABOUT IT?

47:20.199 --> 47:24.139
LOOK.

47:24.159 --> 47:25.130
ALSO WHO WEARS A CLOAK ANYMORE?

A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME, BUT

48:05.030 --> 48:06.039
THEN LATER YOU JUST WANT TO

FORGET - YOU TRIED IT, IT WAS

STUPID, MOVE ON: LIKE ORAL SEX
