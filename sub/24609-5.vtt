47:15.440 --> 47:16.782
(MONITOR BEEPS FAINTLY)

47:30.040 --> 47:32.258
Oh, thank God.

47:33.360 --> 47:35.066
Thank God.

47:35.440 --> 47:36.759
I'll get the doctor.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.781
You're tough, aren't you?

48:47.680 --> 48:49.068
(SOFI'LY)
Now, you listen to me,

48:51.680 --> 48:52.704
'Kay?

48:57.600 --> 48:58.703
I will not

49:01.840 --> 49:03.785
let you grow up in this place.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.103
I won't do it.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.257
Do you hear me?

49:17.520 --> 49:18.703
They.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.626
They do not own you.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.509
And they do not own
what you will become.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.343
Do you hear me?

49:46.080 --> 49:47.707
I'm gonna get you out of here.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.266
I'm gonna get us out of here.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.583
I promise you.

50:09.400 --> 50:10.537
I promise.
