41:09.860 --> 41:11.330
It's just saying,

41:11.330 --> 41:13.130
"this may have been
once my property,

41:13.130 --> 41:15.170
and I want to make sure
you're taking care of it,"

41:15.170 --> 41:16.530
and it seems like you are.

41:16.540 --> 41:19.240
So I think you can live
with what's here, coexist,

41:19.240 --> 41:21.470
and really feel comfortable.
Oh, wow.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.110
Oh, my gosh. Appreciate it
so much. Thank you.

41:24.110 --> 41:25.640
Well, thank you so much
for having us out.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.110
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you for coming in.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.310
-Oh, my gosh.
-We appreciate everything.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.610
Chris will be staying
on top of things.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.420
He'll let us know
if you guys need anything else.

41:31.420 --> 41:33.650
And if you need our help,
we'll come back.

41:33.650 --> 41:36.890
-Okay. Thank you so much.
-I sure appreciate it so much.

41:36.890 --> 41:38.360
We hope that
this new understanding

41:38.360 --> 41:39.760
of deep family roots

41:39.760 --> 41:42.090
brings anissa and jade
peace of mind

41:42.100 --> 41:46.970
and that jade no longer feels
the need to pack up and leave.

41:46.970 --> 41:50.600
Anissa will hopefully be able
to keep her family intact

41:50.600 --> 41:52.170
under one roof,

41:52.170 --> 41:54.210
with the feeling
that they are now safe

41:54.210 --> 41:56.540
in this beautiful colonial home.
