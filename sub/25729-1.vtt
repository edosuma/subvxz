- (Man 2) We... We were just...
- Reading.

02:02.167 --> 02:04.500
We have a book club, you see.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.497
You know the authorities are trying
to encourage cultural association

02:09.625 --> 02:12.333
as part of your model occupation.

02:12.458 --> 02:15.530
- Yes, yes, book lovers, that's us.
- (Groans)

02:15.667 --> 02:17.579
(German officer)
What is the name of your club?

02:17.708 --> 02:19.916
- Erm...
- (Woman) Erm...

02:20.917 --> 02:24.661
- The Guernsey Literary and...
- (Burps) The bloody potato peel pie...

02:24.792 --> 02:27.455
The Guernsey Literary
and Potato Peel Pie...

02:27.583 --> 02:30.621
The Guernsey Literary
and Potato Peel Pie Society.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.868
It should be on the list.
Guernsey Literary...

02:34.667 --> 02:37.455
You're not confiscating
potato peelings yet, are you?

02:37.583 --> 02:41.076
(Speaks German)

02:41.208 --> 02:43.416
This is an illegal assembly.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.875
You will come with us. All of you!

- (Eben groans)

02:53.375 --> 02:54.832
Shall I help put him into your car?

02:55.583 --> 02:59.406
You will register this group...
first thing in the morning!

03:00.292 --> 03:02.454

(Typewriter clicks)

03:18.958 --> 03:20.790
(Bell chimes)

03:32.458 --> 03:36.372
- Oh, so "The Times" have been onto me.
- Fresh paint!

03:36.500 --> 03:38.457
When was the last time you saw that?

03:38.583 --> 03:39.664
(Man) Oh...

03:39.792 --> 03:42.864
One might almost believe
the war is really over.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.374
(Man) Yes, they want you to do
an article

03:45.500 --> 03:46.707
about reading.

03:46.833 --> 03:51.077
(Groans) No. Sidney, no. I don't think
I'm much up for any more Izzy.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.495
Actually, they want Juliet Ashton.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.457
It's your own voice this time.
I've said yes.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.041
Huh! Have you? (Sighs)

03:58.167 --> 04:00.659
Well, you might have said no,
and I make better decisions.

04:00.792 --> 04:03.284
So, your book tour starts Monday week.
Bath to Yorkshire.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.500
"The Times" will fill the gap nicely...

04:06.875 --> 04:08.787
There we are.

04:08.917 --> 04:12.115
- (Bus bell rings)
- Oh, speaking of which, here we are.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.286
Our stop.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.327
- (Applause)
- (Juliet) Thank you.

04:17.416 --> 04:18.908
- (Woman) Miss Ashton?
- Yes?

04:19.041 --> 04:21.204
(Woman) Have you always wanted
to be a writer?

04:21.333 --> 04:22.494
(Juliet) Always, yes.

04:22.625 --> 04:26.790
It's the perfect job.
Sitting, indoors, always near a teapot.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.078
(Laughter)

04:29.167 --> 04:30.783
It has its ups and downs.

04:30.917 --> 04:35.036
My first book, "A Critical Biography
of Anne Brontë", sold only...

04:35.167 --> 04:36.499
How many copies, Sidney?

04:37.083 --> 04:40.326
- My publisher, Mr Sidney Stark.
- Twenty-eight copies.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.745
- Worldwide.
- (Awkward laughter)

04:43.875 --> 04:47.164
Why Izzy Bickerstaff?
Why not write under your real name?

04:49.375 --> 04:53.198
Erm... I'm not sure
which came to me first,

04:53.333 --> 04:56.076
Izzy's name or his voice.

04:56.208 --> 04:59.906
In either case, they both seemed
to suit the tone of the task.

05:00.042 --> 05:01.578
Much better than my own.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.825
(Woman) Are you working on a new book?

05:03.958 --> 05:05.870
(Juliet) Well, I'm not sure
I'd call Izzy a book

05:06.000 --> 05:08.538
as much as a collection
of faintly amusing essays.

05:08.667 --> 05:09.703
(Sidney clears throat)

05:11.083 --> 05:12.915
(Clears throat) Yes, I am.

05:13.958 --> 05:17.451
English foibles.
Er, a miscellany of English absurdity.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.907
For example, there's a London society
for public decency...

05:22.833 --> 05:26.326
- which advocates trousers for horses.
- (Laughter)

05:40.875 --> 05:46.496
Oh. A pleasure to meet you, Miss Ashton.
A delight. I'm such a huge fan.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.287
Oh. (Chuckles) Thank you.

05:48.417 --> 05:51.706
Oh, poor old Izzy.
Had no use for a war, did he?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.370
Only wanted to be left alone
with his pint.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.708
- (Chuckles)
- Here we are.

05:57.625 --> 06:03.075
Quite frankly, Izzy Bickerstaff's why
you get first dibs here, Miss Ashton.

06:03.208 --> 06:05.621
But you mustn't dally. No.

06:05.750 --> 06:09.664
- It's sure to go in a flash.
- (Gasps)

06:09.792 --> 06:11.078
(Gasps)

06:15.583 --> 06:16.949
(Whimpers)

06:47.500 --> 06:49.036
Father's paperweight.

06:49.167 --> 06:52.001
(Sidney) Juliet. Juliet.

06:52.708 --> 06:55.906
Where are you?
Come back from the edge!

06:56.458 --> 06:57.619
(Juliet whimpers)

07:00.125 --> 07:01.411
(Exhales) It's all right.

07:01.542 --> 07:02.874
(Gasps)

07:05.500 --> 07:07.241
(Man) Pure crystal.

07:08.167 --> 07:10.500
Oh, yes. Yes, that's very nice.

07:11.333 --> 07:12.619
Do you...

07:13.458 --> 07:15.415
see the crystal, Juliet?

07:16.958 --> 07:18.290
Lovely.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.958
(Man) Wonderful view
of Kensington Gardens.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.662
Albert Hall round the corner.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.784
It's a steal at this price.

07:29.375 --> 07:30.491
It is beautiful.

07:30.625 --> 07:33.368
I knew you'd love it.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.787
I'm terribly sorry.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.625
At long last you can afford
something smart. Rejoice.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.161
I feel a complete fraud here.

07:45.292 --> 07:48.615
Juliet, you really do need something better
than a poky bedsit in Battersea,

07:48.750 --> 07:50.992
with three suitcases and a typewriter.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.492
- (Juliet) I realise.
- Oh, I see...

07:54.125 --> 07:55.957
Poor thing! You feel
you haven't suffered enough.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.291
(Sighs) I expect not.

07:58.417 --> 08:03.037
Well, far be it for me to relieve you
of your solemn duty, but I'll tell you what...

08:03.167 --> 08:07.116
We will buy new flats for everyone else
in London who was bombed out,

08:07.250 --> 08:10.368
just as soon as Izzy hits number one.
Will that make it better?

08:10.500 --> 08:13.948
(Laughs) It is a strong start.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.491
(Sidney) This could be a proper home.

08:19.042 --> 08:21.159
(Juliet) It is a proper home, Sidney.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.074
It's just not mine.

08:23.208 --> 08:24.619
(♪ Jazz music)

08:36.457 --> 08:38.871
- (Man 1) Excuse me.
- (Man 2) Hey, come on, don't be shy!

08:43.957 --> 08:45.449
(American accent) Coming through.

08:47.542 --> 08:50.990
You'll need an enormous window
to put your desk in front of.

08:51.125 --> 08:54.084
You don't get enough sun as it is.
Waiter, I'll keep the bottle.

08:54.875 --> 08:58.539
Fireplace to keep you warm...
when you're not with me.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.875
Markham Reynolds.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.243
Diplomat and clairvoyant.
You're a wonder.

09:04.375 --> 09:05.491
At your service.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.537
Right.

09:08.667 --> 09:12.160
Now, what good is a window
if I haven't given you a view?

09:12.292 --> 09:13.703
(Laughs)

09:16.375 --> 09:18.332
(♪ Jazz music continues)

09:25.667 --> 09:26.703
Watch this.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.995
(Both laugh)

09:43.917 --> 09:45.453
Mr Reynolds.

09:45.583 --> 09:48.781
- I've asked you to stop.
- (Juliet) Oh God, you've been caught.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.749
Yet still you persist. Look at this.

09:50.875 --> 09:54.494
Do you imagine I've got a storeroom just
brimming with vases for my tenants to use?

09:54.625 --> 09:56.491
(Markham) I apologise again, Mrs Burns.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.241
Times are tough.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.367
Florists, they need the work.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.868
Flowers. Hope she knows
what a lucky girl she is.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.198
- (Chuckles) Come on.
- Goodbye, Mrs Burns.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.912
- (Markham) Goodnight.
- (Juliet) Goodnight.

10:11.042 --> 10:12.499
(Door shuts)

10:12.625 --> 10:14.207
- Your mail.
- (Juliet) Ah...

10:14.333 --> 10:15.699
- Thank you.
- And your flowers.

10:15.833 --> 10:19.952
Oh... Oh, please keep the flowers
for yourself, Mrs Burns, won't you?

10:20.083 --> 10:22.075
Oh, thank you.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.701
And no more typing, now, Miss Ashton.
It's well after ten.

10:25.833 --> 10:26.949
(Juliet) OK.

10:27.083 --> 10:30.656
(Mrs Burns) Sound of that clatter.
Worse than gunfire!

10:36.208 --> 10:38.450
(Juliet) Forwarded from Oakley Street.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.166
"Dear Miss Ashton,
my name is Dawsey Adams.

10:46.292 --> 10:49.410
"I live on my farm
on the island of Guernsey."

10:49.542 --> 10:51.283
Guernsey?

10:51.917 --> 10:53.249
(Door opens)

10:59.667 --> 11:02.660
(Juliet) "I know of you
because I have an old book,

"'The Selected Essays of Elia',
by Charles Lamb,

11:06.750 --> 11:09.618
"that has your name
and address written inside."

11:09.750 --> 11:12.208
(Dawsey) 'I've read it many times.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.791
'There wasn't much else to do here
during the occupation

11:14.917 --> 11:16.658
'and Charles Lamb made me laugh.'

11:16.792 --> 11:20.411
"Especially when he wrote
about the roast pig." (Laughs)

11:20.542 --> 11:22.329
(Dawsey) 'I am part of a book club,

11:22.458 --> 11:26.202
'The Guernsey Literary
and Potato Peel Pie Society.

11:26.333 --> 11:31.203
'We actually formed because we had to
keep a roast pig secret from the Germans.

11:31.333 --> 11:35.953
'So, I like Charles Lamb,
which is why I'm writing to you.

11:36.083 --> 11:40.453
'The Germans are gone now,
but there are no bookshops left on Guernsey.

11:40.583 --> 11:44.327
'I am looking for a copy of Charles Lamb's
"Tales From Shakespeare",

11:44.458 --> 11:46.324
'which I understand he wrote for children.

11:46.917 --> 11:50.081
'Could you send me the address
of a bookshop in London?

11:50.208 --> 11:53.497
'I hope not to trouble you.
Dawsey Adams.'

11:54.042 --> 11:55.578
(Juliet) 'Dear Mr Adams,

11:55.708 --> 11:59.031
'I'm so pleased your letter found me
and that my book found you.

11:59.625 --> 12:04.916
'It was a sad wrench to part with Mr Lamb,
but I was rather low on funds at the time.

12:05.042 --> 12:08.365
'Perhaps there is some secret
sort of homing instincts in books

12:08.500 --> 12:11.368
- 'that brings them to their perfect readers.'
- Thank you.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.366
(Juliet) 'How delightful if that were true.'

12:13.500 --> 12:15.913
- (Shopkeeper) Here.

'How could a pig cause you
to begin a literary society?

what is a potato peel pie?'

a carnival's wonderful. Let's dance.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.534
You know, I've been giving
some more thought to your view.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.910
(Sighs) Sidney has lined up
some more flats for me to see.

14:49.042 --> 14:52.035
- It's just a matter of making the time.
- It's occurred to me...

14:52.167 --> 14:55.490
There's apartments on Fifth Avenue.
Look out over Central Park.

14:58.292 --> 15:01.581
With views of the lake,
the entire reservoir...

15:03.208 --> 15:05.996
There's even a little pond
where kids sail model boats.

15:08.042 --> 15:10.455
I've never been to New York.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.996
Well, it would be really fun
to show you my city.

15:14.833 --> 15:16.745
That's something worth thinking about.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.619
(Door closes)

15:46.792 --> 15:48.784
(♪ Hums)

16:12.250 --> 16:13.786
(Dawsey) 'Dear Miss Ashton.

16:13.917 --> 16:17.706
'Thank you for finding me a copy
of Mr Lamb's "Tales From Shakespeare".

16:17.833 --> 16:20.416
'And even more for sending it as a gift.

16:20.542 --> 16:24.491
'I am happy to settle this debt
by answering your questions.'

16:28.083 --> 16:29.244
(Pig squeals)

16:30.500 --> 16:32.366
- (Indistinct shouting)
- (Dog barks)

16:34.167 --> 16:37.205
(Dawsey) 'A roast pig
had to be kept a secret

16:37.333 --> 16:40.997
'because the Germans
took all our animals away in 1940,

16:41.125 --> 16:42.787
'to feed their soldiers on the Continent.'

16:42.917 --> 16:45.500
This is my farm! These are my pigs!

16:45.625 --> 16:48.117
(Dawsey) 'It was against the law
to keep even one.'

16:48.917 --> 16:50.579
(Officer speaks German)

16:55.042 --> 16:56.078
Yes.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.790
(Continues in German)

16:58.750 --> 17:01.208
(Dawsey) 'They ordered me
to grow potatoes.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.243
'Food was already scarce
by the first winter of the occupation.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.163
'A proper meal was had only in memory.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.534
'Like our radios, which they'd taken.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.038
'And the post, which they'd suspended.

17:18.708 --> 17:21.496
'And the telegraph cables
that they'd cut.

17:21.625 --> 17:25.039
'We lived our lives in isolation.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.532
'Then one day...'

17:41.125 --> 17:42.707
(Juliet) Butcher's knife?

17:55.167 --> 17:57.204
(Dawsey) Mrs Maugery.

17:58.292 --> 17:59.999
How can I help?

18:00.708 --> 18:02.825
See? I told you he'd come.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.409
- (Snorts)
- (Dawsey chuckles)

18:10.542 --> 18:11.578
Hey, old girl!

18:11.708 --> 18:14.200
(Dawsey) 'While Mrs Maugery
had hidden the pig away...'

18:14.333 --> 18:16.245
I hope you don't think less of me.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.163
(Dawsey) '...the idea of roasting it
and hosting a dinner

18:20.292 --> 18:22.375
'belonged to Elizabeth McKenna.'

18:28.708 --> 18:29.744
(Woman) Oh...

18:32.750 --> 18:35.367
Mm... Oh!

18:38.333 --> 18:40.450
(Dawsey) 'We were all hungry,

18:40.583 --> 18:44.782
'but it was Elizabeth
who realised our true starvation -

18:45.375 --> 18:48.789
'for connection,
the company of other people.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.620
'For fellowship.'

18:55.750 --> 18:57.582
- (Elizabeth) Amelia?
- (Amelia) Oh.

18:58.583 --> 19:02.156
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, it's a pleasure! Oh, my goodness!

19:02.292 --> 19:05.035
(Dawsey) 'Miss Isola Pribby,
another neighbour,

19:05.167 --> 19:07.955
'provided the gin,
which she makes herself,

'along with other herbal remedies
and home cures.'

19:12.458 --> 19:14.290
That's what we've got tonight.

19:21.875 --> 19:23.582
(Cork pops)

19:23.708 --> 19:25.791
- Miss Pribby.
- (Mumbles)

19:30.708 --> 19:32.370
Oh, thank you.

19:34.958 --> 19:36.119
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.161
(Gasps)

19:40.958 --> 19:42.039
(Coughs)

19:44.833 --> 19:46.790
- (Elizabeth) May I take your coat?
- Oh...

19:56.250 --> 19:58.583
Dawsey, didn't know you'd be here.

19:58.708 --> 20:00.700
- (Amelia) Evening, Eben.
- Ah, Amelia.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.156
(Dawsey) 'Eben Ramsey,
our local postmaster, brought...'

20:04.292 --> 20:06.955
An entirely new creation.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.783
A potato peel pie.

20:10.917 --> 20:15.366
No butter, no flour, just potatoes...

20:16.167 --> 20:17.999
and potato peelings.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.411
- Oh.
- (Elizabeth) Wonderful.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.158
That sounds lovely.

20:21.292 --> 20:24.615
Pat Murphy was getting on a bit
and he sort of lost his spark.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.242
(Dawsey) 'We all knew each other,
of course, but not well.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.412
'It was Elizabeth we had in common.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.000
'And for a few hours,
she brought us together

20:32.125 --> 20:36.540
'and helped us forget the occupation,
the Germans, war,

20:36.667 --> 20:40.240
'everything we had lost,
and to remember our humanity.'

20:40.375 --> 20:44.039
It was for her husband.
And he was found underneath his wife.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.079
- (Amelia) Oh, no.
- (Isola) Maybe he died of natural causes,

20:46.208 --> 20:48.666
- but it was probably my tincture.
- (Elizabeth) Really?

20:48.792 --> 20:50.579
(Laughter)

20:51.958 --> 20:53.165
(German officer) Stop!

20:53.292 --> 20:55.625
- (Dog barks)
- What is the name of your club?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.708
(Dawsey) 'After that, we had no choice

21:00.833 --> 21:04.952
'but to make the Guernsey Literary
and Potato Peel Pie Society real.'

21:24.667 --> 21:26.078
(Eben) Careful.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.074
Here. Take that.

21:34.542 --> 21:35.658
(Dawsey) 'Hmm.

21:36.625 --> 21:39.584
'And this is how
I came to know of Charles Lamb.'

21:45.583 --> 21:47.074
(Elizabeth) You can't read it now.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.454
(Elizabeth) Oh, my God!

21:52.583 --> 21:55.291
(Man speaks German in the distance)

21:55.417 --> 21:57.830
- (Whispers) OK, let's go, go, go.
- (Dog barks)

21:58.583 --> 21:59.824
(Dawsey) Last log.

22:00.833 --> 22:03.792
(Amelia) There's this one
by Anthony Trollope.

22:03.917 --> 22:05.078
- Anyone interested?
- Yes.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.165
Let him have that one,
I don't want to read that.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.579
(Eben) Mary Shelley.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.449
Yeats? WB Yeats?

22:11.583 --> 22:13.745
- (Eben) Oh...
- (Elizabeth) Not for me.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.537
- (Snores)
- (Eben) Jane Austen knew

22:15.667 --> 22:18.910
whereof she spoke,
and she spoke most elegantly.

22:19.042 --> 22:21.955
Manners is what holds
a society together.

22:22.083 --> 22:24.621
That, and a reliable postal service.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.958
- (Officer continues snoring)
- (Laughter)

22:27.542 --> 22:33.948
At bottom, propriety
is concern for other people.

22:34.958 --> 22:41.159
When that goes out the window,
the gates of hell are surely opened

22:41.292 --> 22:44.285
and ignorance is king.

22:44.417 --> 22:46.124
Shh.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.492
- (Laughs)
- Shh.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.241
(Officer continues snoring)

22:51.000 --> 22:52.992
(Dawsey) 'The monitor never returned.

22:55.292 --> 22:58.490
'Our Friday night book club
became a refuge to us.

22:59.042 --> 23:03.662
'A private freedom to feel
the world growing darker all around you,

'but need only a candle
to see new worlds unfold.

(Pen scratches)

23:16.208 --> 23:18.575
'But I don't need to tell you this.

23:18.708 --> 23:20.449
'You already know what books can do.

23:21.667 --> 23:26.162
'That's something we share,
different as our lives may be.'

'When I lost my parents,

24:00.583 --> 24:04.327
'it was the world of books

to sit in on your meeting

I might be welcome at all.

I am also a writer.

'I offer this as proof
that I come to you in peace.'

- Sidney. Sidney.
- Hold on one second.

24:42.958 --> 24:45.245
What the Dickens did I...?
Mrs B? Thank you.

24:45.375 --> 24:49.995
Juliet, you cannot go to a book club meeting
on the island of Guernsey.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.037
It's a leap of faith
they'll even let me in.

24:52.167 --> 24:53.874
You're reading in Cambridge, Friday.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.037
But the Society, they meet on a Friday.

24:56.167 --> 24:58.750
I can't wait. I'll only be gone
the weekend, back Monday.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.947
- Edinburgh.
- You're in Edinburgh Monday!

25:02.083 --> 25:05.622
(Sighs) I don't know why we provide you
with an itinerary, I really don't.

25:05.750 --> 25:06.866
I don't. I just don't.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.663
Well, this is your fault.
You said "yes" to "The Times".

25:09.792 --> 25:11.658
- Excuse me, my fault?
- (Chuckles)

25:11.792 --> 25:17.038
Sidney, what books,
what reading did for these people,

25:17.167 --> 25:19.329
finally, I'll have
something serious to write.

25:19.458 --> 25:23.907
Hmm. This wouldn't be just to get out of
reading Izzy in Cambridge, would it?

25:24.042 --> 25:25.499
(Scoffs)

25:26.000 --> 25:29.289
You're not... You're not running away?

25:29.417 --> 25:31.374
Ha-ha-ha! You're too funny.

25:32.375 --> 25:35.573
Well, I can't imagine Mark
would let you get very far anyway.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.745
- "Let me."
- Hm-hmm.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.033
(Markham) You have everything you need?

25:51.167 --> 25:54.535
(Juliet) Erm... Yes, I do.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.573
- Say that again.
- (Chuckles) What? I have everything.

25:58.708 --> 26:02.076
Mark, it's the English Channel,
not the China Seas.

26:02.208 --> 26:06.498
Say, "I do." Or simply say, "Yes."

26:08.542 --> 26:09.874
(Chuckles) What?

26:12.708 --> 26:14.870
- (Markham) Juliet...
- (Gasps)

26:15.000 --> 26:17.333
Let me give you your perfect home.

26:18.125 --> 26:19.582
I already know mine's with you.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.701
Whether it's here or New York
or the North Pole.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.415
(Laughs awkwardly)

26:25.333 --> 26:27.871
I wanna make that home together. Ours.

26:31.542 --> 26:33.909
- (Juliet gasps)
- Say you'll marry me, Juliet.

26:37.708 --> 26:39.916
(Ship's horn blows)

26:40.042 --> 26:41.408
(Whispers) Yes.

26:41.542 --> 26:43.499
I know we've only been together
for six months,

26:43.625 --> 26:45.833
- but they've been the happiest...
- (Laughs) Yes!

26:45.958 --> 26:47.449
- Yes!
- (Laughs)

26:47.583 --> 26:49.575
(Crowd cheers, applauds)

26:49.708 --> 26:52.780
- (Man) Congratulations!
- (Both laugh)

26:52.917 --> 26:54.203
Erm...

26:54.333 --> 26:56.040
If you just...

26:57.417 --> 26:58.703
(Laughs)

27:07.167 --> 27:09.159
(Chuckles)

27:41.583 --> 27:42.664
(Sighs)

28:10.500 --> 28:11.832
(Sighs)

28:21.875 --> 28:22.911
(Exhales)

28:23.042 --> 28:24.533
(Mutters under her breath)

28:27.792 --> 28:29.283
(Dawsey) I'll get another load.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.874
(Juliet pants)

28:36.208 --> 28:37.699
(Groans)

28:41.667 --> 28:44.739
Excuse me?
I was looking for a place to stay.

28:45.333 --> 28:46.915
- Erm...
- (Shrieks)

28:47.042 --> 28:48.829
(Dawsey) Peter, watch it!

28:48.958 --> 28:50.494
Sorry.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.621
Try at the post office.
They should be able to help you out.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.161
- Right.
- (Peter) Heads up.

28:57.292 --> 28:59.079
(Juliet shrieks and gasps)

29:00.000 --> 29:01.457
Sorry, below!

29:04.833 --> 29:07.621
Tha... Thank you. I think...

29:11.458 --> 29:14.075
(Bell continues to ring)

29:15.750 --> 29:17.457
(Juliet) Thank you. (Chuckles)

29:18.250 --> 29:20.958
- Oh, hello.
- (Eben) Who is it?

29:21.083 --> 29:23.325
- It's a miss.
- (Eben) What's she want?

29:23.458 --> 29:25.245
Have I had a chance to ask?

29:26.000 --> 29:29.368
(Chuckles) I was sent
from The Crown... Hotel.

29:29.500 --> 29:33.289
- (Eben) They're closed. Roof's gone.
- Yes, er, I know.

29:33.417 --> 29:36.740
A man over there said that
you might be able to help with the...

29:36.875 --> 29:38.787
(Sighs) Does he come out
from behind there?

29:38.917 --> 29:42.081
Not a lot of options at the moment,
places to stay.

29:42.208 --> 29:45.747
Er, least of them
is with Charlotte Stimple.

29:47.375 --> 29:52.291
She lets rooms, sometimes.
Keeps a clean house.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.618
Er, Eli can take you up there,
if you like.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.083
Oh, I wouldn't want him
to have to make a special trip.

29:59.208 --> 30:01.416
Well, he has mail to deliver, anyway.

30:01.542 --> 30:04.034
Ah. Well, thank you, then...

30:04.167 --> 30:05.578
Eben Ramsey.

30:06.292 --> 30:09.660
Eben Ramsey? The Eben Ramsey?

30:09.792 --> 30:12.580
Inventor of the potato peel pie?

30:12.708 --> 30:15.542
(Gasps) But you're why I've come!

30:15.667 --> 30:18.330
Him? You came for his pie?

30:18.458 --> 30:23.203
Er, no, I came for the meeting...
of your society.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.825
I've been corresponding
with a friend of yours, Mr Adams.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.666
- The writer? You're the writer?
- Yes.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.950
Yes, I am. I'm Juliet Ashton.

30:33.833 --> 30:37.372
- You're beautiful.
- (Chuckles) Oh, thank you.

30:38.083 --> 30:42.498
Goodness! Eli, get the cart.
He'll take you right up to Charlotte.

30:42.625 --> 30:45.368
I'll call round,
let everybody know you're here.

30:46.417 --> 30:49.785
A real writer. Come to see us.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.458
(Seagulls cry)

31:04.667 --> 31:06.283
(Laughs)

31:10.375 --> 31:11.707
(Juliet) Oh! (Laughs)

31:32.875 --> 31:35.037
Five and six a night.

31:35.167 --> 31:37.033
Wonderful.

31:44.667 --> 31:46.954
In advance, if you don't mind.

31:48.292 --> 31:50.079
Oh. Of course.

31:55.917 --> 31:58.079
What brings you from London?

32:01.417 --> 32:04.865
- And the bathroom is...?
- It's just down the hall.

32:07.083 --> 32:09.325
- Towels are just...
- Oh, I see it.

32:09.458 --> 32:11.916
- Thank you again.
- Oh!

32:12.042 --> 32:14.329
I need your ration coupons
if you'd like milk with your tea.

32:14.458 --> 32:17.246
Black tea is lovely, thank you.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.286
(Sighs)

32:25.250 --> 32:27.287
(Footsteps)

32:57.375 --> 32:58.411
(Exhales)

33:23.292 --> 33:24.874
(Chicken clucks)

33:26.042 --> 33:27.704
(Juliet laughs) Hello.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.162
(Knocking on door)

33:38.042 --> 33:39.499
(Door opens)

33:40.542 --> 33:43.285
(Clears throat) Mrs Maugery?
Good evening, I'm Ju...

33:43.417 --> 33:46.285
Miss Ashton.
Yes, we're expecting you.

33:47.042 --> 33:49.659
- Rather suddenly.
- Oh, I know.

33:49.792 --> 33:52.034
- I do hope I'm not imposing.
- (Hiccups)

33:53.208 --> 33:54.915
Well, here you are.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.040
Come in.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.291
- (Juliet) Thank you.
- (Door closes)

34:01.042 --> 34:02.283
Erm, Miss Ashton.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.740
Oh, Juliet, please. I'm afraid
I've made a mistake in inviting...

34:05.875 --> 34:08.208
No, no, no, no.
We are thrilled to have you.

34:09.875 --> 34:12.708
The last real-life author we had
was Clara Saussey.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.246
She read her cookbook to us back in '44.

34:15.375 --> 34:18.368
- Barely escaped with her life.
- (Laughs)

34:19.250 --> 34:21.411
We were famished.

34:21.542 --> 34:23.408
I'm Isola Pribby.

34:23.542 --> 34:26.080
So happy to make your acquaintance.

34:27.042 --> 34:29.580
Erm, I'm... so happy to join you.

34:29.708 --> 34:30.915
Erm...

34:32.500 --> 34:34.958
- Has Mr Adams arrived yet?
- Dawsey?

34:35.083 --> 34:37.199
- I've yet to meet him.
- (Knocking on door)

34:38.500 --> 34:39.956
You've conjured him.

34:41.583 --> 34:43.791
- And your society's founder...
- (Door opens)

34:43.917 --> 34:46.455
Erm, your society's founder,
Elizabeth McKenna?

34:46.583 --> 34:49.417
- I'm so looking forward to meeting her.
- You won't be meeting her.

34:50.125 --> 34:51.161
Oh...

34:52.250 --> 34:54.333
She's off-island at present.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.494
(Eben) Fair Juliet.

34:58.333 --> 34:59.949
- Ah...
- We meet again.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.415
(Chuckles) Eben.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.287
So, who's presenting tonight?

35:26.417 --> 35:28.124
- Why, you are, of course.
- Me?

35:28.250 --> 35:30.583
Yeah, we were hoping you'd read

35:30.708 --> 35:33.291
- at least the first chapter for us.
- (Sighs)

35:33.417 --> 35:36.080
None of us having had a chance yet
to read it for ourselves.

35:36.208 --> 35:39.576
- But we can't start without...
- Dawsey!

35:43.333 --> 35:46.121
- Erm, hello.
- Hello.

35:49.458 --> 35:52.166
- Dawsey Adams.
- Juliet Ashton.

35:52.292 --> 35:55.785
- You two have met.
- In a way, yes.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.533
Earlier.

35:57.667 --> 36:00.910
Nearly killed her
on the steps of The Crown today.

36:01.042 --> 36:03.125
Oh, I was thinking in a past life.

36:05.333 --> 36:07.165
But this afternoon does make sense.

36:09.708 --> 36:11.040
Thank you again for the books.

36:13.250 --> 36:14.331
Thank you.

36:14.458 --> 36:17.201
Miss Ashton was just getting ready
to read to us from her book.

36:17.333 --> 36:18.369
(Eben) Yes, well,

36:18.500 --> 36:20.617
- let's have a crack at her then, shall we?
- Right.

36:24.542 --> 36:25.578
Fair Juliet.

36:26.583 --> 36:27.915
Here?

36:29.208 --> 36:32.326
Best of luck.
See you on the other side.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.078
(Clears throat)

36:38.875 --> 36:40.082
Right, erm...

36:40.208 --> 36:41.995
The presenter usually stands.

36:42.125 --> 36:43.286
Oh.

36:44.542 --> 36:46.499
- (Clears throat)
- (Clock ticks)

36:49.250 --> 36:50.286
Begin.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.540
(Clears throat)

36:57.667 --> 37:01.206
Anne Brontë. A Life.

37:01.333 --> 37:04.405
You think Anne Brontë
is better than Charlotte?

37:04.542 --> 37:06.158
- I agree.
- I do not.

37:06.292 --> 37:11.367
"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall" a more
important book than "Wuthering Heights"?

37:11.500 --> 37:13.241
- No, no, no... (Laughs)
- (Eben) The idea!

37:13.375 --> 37:15.287
- No, not better.
- (Amelia) I agree with you.

37:15.417 --> 37:18.455
I'm saying that Anne
is more modern than Emily.

37:18.583 --> 37:20.666
Particularly with respect
to the status of women.

37:20.792 --> 37:23.079
More so than Charlotte Brontë
when she wrote "Jane Eyre"?

37:23.208 --> 37:25.666
Very doubtful.
Doubtful, doubtful, doubtful.

37:25.792 --> 37:30.162
"Do you think because I am poor,
obscure, plain and little,

37:30.292 --> 37:33.615
"that I am soulless and heartless?
You think wrong!

37:33.750 --> 37:37.198
"I have as much soul as you!
And full as much heart!"

37:37.333 --> 37:39.996
Oh! You did that beautifully!

37:40.125 --> 37:42.037
(Chuckles) I do love "Jane Eyre".

37:42.167 --> 37:43.533
- (Juliet) As do I!
- "Jane Eyre"?

37:43.667 --> 37:45.875
As do I! And while Jane's assertion,

37:46.000 --> 37:50.074
"I have as much soul as you,"
was remarkable, directed to a gentleman,

37:50.208 --> 37:53.906
it only begins to get at the idea
of equality between them.

37:54.042 --> 37:58.161
In "Wildfell Hall", Anne Brontë laid bare
the essential imbalance of power

37:58.292 --> 38:01.456
between men and women
in the suffocating hierarchal structure

38:01.583 --> 38:03.245
of Victorian marriage.

38:03.375 --> 38:07.119
She challenged the conventional thinking
of an entire society

38:07.250 --> 38:09.458
- and changed people's minds.
- (Alarm clock rings)

38:09.583 --> 38:10.790
(Laughs)

38:11.708 --> 38:13.665
- (Dawsey) Well done.
- Oh, I had no idea.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.125
Anne Brontë, she did quite a bit,
didn't she?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.116
(Amelia) Well done, Miss Ashton.

38:18.250 --> 38:19.536
- You kept going!
- Splendid!

38:19.667 --> 38:20.874
Against all the arguments!

38:21.000 --> 38:25.540
But I'm afraid you've yet to have
the full experience.

38:25.667 --> 38:28.501
- Oh!
- I find that difficult to believe.

38:28.625 --> 38:31.459
That's the second attack
you've survived today. It's good.

38:31.583 --> 38:35.873
- An authentic potato peel pie.
- Oh!

38:36.000 --> 38:37.832
Original recipe.

38:37.958 --> 38:40.701
Er, no butter, no flour.

38:40.833 --> 38:44.281
No, er... Well, it's potatoes

38:44.417 --> 38:46.329
- and potato peelings.
- (Laughs)

38:46.458 --> 38:48.575
You'll want this gin quick after.

38:49.708 --> 38:50.744
(Juliet) Oh...

38:50.875 --> 38:53.367
- (Eben) A little taste.
- (Juliet) Is this safe?

38:53.500 --> 38:56.698
- It's just potatoes.
- Oh, erm...

39:01.542 --> 39:03.955
- (Gags)
- Quick. Here.

39:04.083 --> 39:05.119
(Juliet gags)

39:08.875 --> 39:12.619
- It... It's the worst!
- (Laughter)

39:12.750 --> 39:16.289
- It's just awful! (Laughs)
- (Amelia) It's horrible. Horrible.

39:17.042 --> 39:21.207
- The gin's very good though!
- Oh! She likes mine!

39:21.333 --> 39:26.033
Ooh. Still, Mr Ramsey, I would love
to get the recipe from you if I could.

39:26.167 --> 39:27.283
She's mad drunk already.

39:27.417 --> 39:32.208
It would be lovely to include in the article.
People adore that sort of detail.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.074
Article?

39:35.042 --> 39:36.078
What article?

39:37.083 --> 39:40.952
Oh, forgive me.
I've gotten ahead of myself.

39:41.083 --> 39:43.996
"The Times" has asked me
to write an article on reading

39:44.125 --> 39:46.913
and I'd like very much
to write about you.

39:47.042 --> 39:49.375
All of you. The Society.

39:49.958 --> 39:52.450
You painted such a vivid story
in your letters.

39:53.292 --> 39:54.624
You came to write about us?

39:54.750 --> 39:56.707
It's for "The London Times".

39:57.875 --> 40:00.413
I mean, only with all your permission,
of course.

40:00.542 --> 40:03.080
I'm sure there are
more interesting subjects to write on.

40:03.208 --> 40:04.744
Oh, no, but your...

40:04.875 --> 40:08.118
The story of your group
and how it was formed, I'm sure that...

40:08.250 --> 40:11.243
- so many would find it as inspiring as I.
- Oh, I don't think so.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.583
- Oh, no, I'm certain they would.
- No!

40:15.750 --> 40:19.949
I'm sure we're not interested in inspiring
the readers of "The London Times".

40:21.042 --> 40:22.078
Thank you all the same.

40:23.417 --> 40:25.033
I see, I'm sorry. I...

40:26.625 --> 40:28.708
I'm sorry to press,
but I'd like to understand.

40:28.833 --> 40:30.699
But how could you understand?

40:33.542 --> 40:35.078
And, er, and...

40:37.792 --> 40:41.081
And people... people wouldn't.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.992
I'm sorry you've come all this way
for nothing.

40:57.292 --> 40:58.828
I had a dream.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.324
Come here.

41:09.667 --> 41:13.365
- And who's this?
- This is Kit. Elizabeth's daughter.

41:15.292 --> 41:17.124
(Kit) Daddy...

41:17.250 --> 41:19.287
Can we go home now?

41:21.042 --> 41:22.328
Yes.

41:22.458 --> 41:24.165
We're going soon.

41:36.208 --> 41:38.291
(Juliet) I'm so sorry
if I embarrassed you.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.705
I feel I owe you an enormous apology.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.665
An apology for what?

41:45.292 --> 41:48.410
For assuming your friends were mine,

41:48.542 --> 41:53.242
making myself the uninvited guest
and a complete ass.

41:53.375 --> 41:55.082
(Chuckles)

41:55.208 --> 41:56.699
And for imagining everyone would think

41:56.833 --> 41:59.450
being featured in "The London Times"
was just a glorious gift.

41:59.583 --> 42:03.281
Amelia is a private person.
I wouldn't give it too much thought.

42:04.250 --> 42:08.540
You sent two books to a stranger.
You can't be all bad, Miss Ashton.

42:09.792 --> 42:12.000
I'd feel much better
if you called me Juliet.

42:15.417 --> 42:21.118
Thank you for coming and for letting me
put a face to the name, Juliet.

42:21.875 --> 42:24.709
Oh. Thank you.

42:26.083 --> 42:27.790
Goodnight, then.

42:27.917 --> 42:29.453
<i>Gniet.</i>

42:35.375 --> 42:36.707
Huh!

42:45.542 --> 42:49.786
I believe I mentioned
I liked to lock my door by nine.

42:49.917 --> 42:51.499
Oh, sorry.

42:51.625 --> 42:55.244
- I... I hope I didn't keep you up.
- You did.

42:55.375 --> 42:59.289
- 10:15 you came in.
- I was at Amelia Maugery's,

42:59.417 --> 43:01.454
meeting with the reading group.

43:02.542 --> 43:05.614
- There was such a lot to talk about.
- I know who you were with.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.616
They're never short of talk.

43:07.750 --> 43:11.573
You just be wise not to believe
everything they tell you.

43:12.708 --> 43:13.949
Erm, I don't understand.

43:14.083 --> 43:17.747
There's more to that story
than they like to let on.

43:18.583 --> 43:20.700
More to what story?

43:22.083 --> 43:25.406
Miss Ashton,
I have never been one to gossip.

43:25.542 --> 43:29.081
So the less said on any of it,
the better.

43:29.208 --> 43:30.619
What...

43:35.542 --> 43:37.374
(Juliet) 'Well, you'll be happy to learn

43:37.500 --> 43:39.787
'I did read before an audience
last night, after all.'

43:39.917 --> 43:43.035
Oh yes? Your farmer-in-the-dell
put you to work, did he?

43:43.167 --> 43:45.329
'How did Izzy play
in the Channel Islands?'

43:45.458 --> 43:48.371
Actually, they requested that I read
from the Brontë biography.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.287
'Blimey, wherever did they dig one up?'

43:50.417 --> 43:52.158
(Scoffs) It was a very big hit.

43:52.292 --> 43:54.204
- Oh, I'm sure it was.
- (Door closes)

43:54.333 --> 43:57.041
Oh, stone the crows, Mrs B.
Good morning.

43:57.167 --> 43:58.874
But, erm...

44:00.042 --> 44:02.079
(Sighs) They don't want me
writing about them.

44:02.208 --> 44:04.996
'Oh, a tremendous hit!
I get you back early now.'

44:05.125 --> 44:07.208
Are you on your way, darling?

44:07.333 --> 44:10.405
- 'W-Well, er...'
- Oh, Mrs B, rebook Edinburgh

44:10.542 --> 44:12.829
- for a week Tu...
- (Juliet) 'No, no, Sidney.'

44:13.458 --> 44:16.075
- I'm still here.
- (Sidney) 'What on earth for?'

44:17.083 --> 44:18.494
Listen, erm...

44:19.125 --> 44:22.618
- Sidney, I have other news.
- (Sidney) 'All right.'

44:22.750 --> 44:25.709
- I'm bracing myself for it.
- (Juliet) 'Er...

44:26.667 --> 44:28.033
'I...

44:28.750 --> 44:31.117
'I hope you won't mind giving me away.'

44:31.917 --> 44:32.953
What's that?

44:33.083 --> 44:35.075
I'm engaged.

44:37.125 --> 44:40.539
To be married. Mark proposed.

44:42.167 --> 44:43.499
'Sidney?

44:45.958 --> 44:47.540
'Sidney?'

44:49.542 --> 44:51.033
Yes, darling, hello.

44:51.167 --> 44:55.707
Erm, congratulations.
That's marvellous news. The best news.

44:57.833 --> 45:00.905
- Are you happy?
- 'Yes. Happy.'

45:01.542 --> 45:02.578
Are you sure?

45:02.708 --> 45:07.282
- Yes, Sidney! I'm very happy.
- 'All right, I'm very happy too, then.'

45:08.042 --> 45:11.285
- And Mark? Mark happy?
- 'Yes.'

45:12.083 --> 45:15.076
- 'Mark there with you?'
- No, he...

45:17.083 --> 45:19.871
Well, he sprung it on me at the boat.
I came alone.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.286
(Phone crackles)

45:21.417 --> 45:24.740
Sid... Sidney, hello? Sidney?

45:24.875 --> 45:25.911
(Rattles phone hook)

45:26.917 --> 45:28.124
(Sighs)

45:28.250 --> 45:30.412
One and 11, please.

45:36.167 --> 45:37.203
(Clears throat)

45:38.083 --> 45:40.166
(Juliet) Are you enjoying the Kipling?

45:40.292 --> 45:41.908
I am. I'm still catching up.

45:42.042 --> 45:44.079
Didn't have much school in Dereham.

45:44.208 --> 45:46.916
But the Society have taken me in hand.

45:47.042 --> 45:48.999
I'll be a genius
by the end of the year.

45:49.125 --> 45:50.491
What were you doing in Dereham?

45:50.625 --> 45:53.538
It's where I was sent for the war,
when they evacuated us kids.

45:54.083 --> 45:55.824
Didn't know they evacuated here as well.

45:55.958 --> 45:57.415
Right before the occupation,

45:57.542 --> 46:00.000
when the Germans
were just across the water in France.

46:00.125 --> 46:02.412
Everyone knew
they'd be coming here next.

46:02.542 --> 46:06.081
We only heard the night before.
England sent ships.

46:09.917 --> 46:11.499
Let's have a look at you.

46:14.542 --> 46:17.535
Come here, now. Wait.

46:20.333 --> 46:22.541
(Man) Move it, please.
Right the way along.

46:24.875 --> 46:26.286
Mind your step.

46:29.125 --> 46:31.538
Take a label, please. Labels.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.040
Go. Go, go, go.

46:34.167 --> 46:36.124
Come on, that's it.
Quickly now.

46:36.250 --> 46:38.708
(Elizabeth) Come on, everyone.
Take a label. Keep it safe.

46:40.542 --> 46:41.532
Thank you.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.081
There.

46:53.542 --> 46:54.908
(Elizabeth) There we go.

46:55.833 --> 46:58.576
Ready for your adventure?
Come with me.

46:58.708 --> 47:00.165
Give me your hand.

47:01.208 --> 47:04.781
I promise I'll look after your grandfather, Eli.
Don't worry.

47:04.917 --> 47:08.490
Even you can't fight the Germans,
Miss, when they come.

47:08.625 --> 47:10.912
And they might come to England, too.

47:12.625 --> 47:14.207
Give me your hand.

47:15.625 --> 47:20.290
My father was given this
in the Great War, for courage.

47:21.125 --> 47:24.994
And the thing is, anyone who keeps it close
can't help but be brave,

47:25.125 --> 47:27.162
even when they're scared.

47:27.292 --> 47:28.453
Do you feel it?

47:30.917 --> 47:34.786
Well, you need to rub it then.
The magic only starts when it gets warm.

47:35.625 --> 47:37.491
(Gasps) I feel it now!

47:37.625 --> 47:40.083
That's a good lad.
Now, you bring that back safe to me.

47:41.667 --> 47:44.330
(Tannoy)
'Strictly no parents to board.'

47:44.458 --> 47:47.166
- There he is.
- 'Strictly no parents to board.'

47:47.292 --> 47:48.703
(Shouting)

47:48.833 --> 47:50.495
(Eben) 'Worst day of the war.

47:51.708 --> 47:54.200
'It nearly broke us, that day.

47:55.333 --> 47:57.700
'When the Germans landed
a few days later,

47:58.958 --> 48:00.540
'we were only half here.

48:02.417 --> 48:06.036
'Our hearts were already elsewhere.'

48:12.000 --> 48:14.583
(Juliet) Cor, it's worn smooth.

48:14.708 --> 48:18.031
- I needed a lot of courage.
- (Eben) Oh, cheer up, Eli.

48:18.167 --> 48:19.703
You'll give it back to her.

48:19.833 --> 48:22.871
There's people coming home
all the time, just like you.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.083
Coming home?

48:26.417 --> 48:28.534
How long has Elizabeth been gone?

48:30.000 --> 48:33.823
(Chuckles) Oh, what a day that was.

48:33.958 --> 48:37.406
Eli was the first boy down the gangway.

48:37.542 --> 48:41.536
He'd grown long legs in five years.
Who would recognise him?

48:41.667 --> 48:43.659
Me, I would.

48:45.167 --> 48:48.285
Care for a scone? Fresh baked.

48:48.417 --> 48:51.410
The Germans arrested her in '44.
Sent her to the Continent.

48:51.542 --> 48:53.659
Arrested her? Why?

48:54.625 --> 48:56.708
I don't know. I wasn't there.

48:57.750 --> 48:59.082
And they don't say.

49:05.375 --> 49:06.741
(Kit laughs)

49:10.167 --> 49:16.494
I was hoping to bribe you for a tour
in exchange for some of Eben's scones.

49:17.167 --> 49:21.207
- Much better than his potato pie.
- (Laughs) Yes.

49:21.667 --> 49:24.535
- I hope so.
- Come on.

49:24.667 --> 49:26.124
Thank you.

49:28.708 --> 49:30.370
- (Kit) Come on!
- (Juliet) Careful, Kit!

49:30.500 --> 49:32.287
- (Kit) It's OK!
- (Juliet) Whoa!

49:32.417 --> 49:33.999
(Dawsey) She knows where she's going.

49:34.125 --> 49:37.323
- (Groans) Oh, oh, oh, no!
- (Kit laughs)

49:42.208 --> 49:43.995
(Juliet sighs)

49:44.125 --> 49:48.540
Sorry, I would take my shoes off
if it weren't for all the wire.

49:48.667 --> 49:50.408
Don't you worry about the wire.

49:50.542 --> 49:53.285
It's the mines
you want to be careful of.

49:53.417 --> 49:54.999
The mines?

49:56.125 --> 50:00.290
(Chuckles) I'm sorry.
Sorry, that's not funny.

50:00.417 --> 50:01.703
- Oh!
- (Laughs)

50:01.833 --> 50:04.120
That's not funny at all!

50:04.250 --> 50:08.699
They did mine the beaches, though.
The whole perimeter of the island.

50:08.833 --> 50:11.701
It took some doing,
but we finally got it all cleared out.

50:12.708 --> 50:14.040
You're safe.

50:15.708 --> 50:16.869
Good.

50:20.792 --> 50:21.873
What are those?

50:22.792 --> 50:25.000
(Dawsey) One of the German lookouts.

50:25.125 --> 50:28.493
They put them up on every point
facing out to sea.

50:29.250 --> 50:32.084
And they set gun positions
all along the coast.

50:32.208 --> 50:34.120
Turned Guernsey into a fortress.

50:34.250 --> 50:37.322
(Juliet) Or a prison.
You were locked up here.

50:37.458 --> 50:39.700
They locked themselves in with us, too.

50:39.833 --> 50:41.620
(Juliet sighs)

50:41.750 --> 50:44.914
Well, it would have to take someone cruel
to build anything as ugly as these

50:45.042 --> 50:46.874
in such a beautiful place.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.913
(Dawsey) They didn't build them,
the Germans, they only designed them.

50:50.708 --> 50:52.074
Who, then?

50:53.500 --> 50:55.708
Todt workers, they were called.

50:55.833 --> 50:57.540
- (Whistle blows)
- (Man shouts in German)

50:57.667 --> 51:00.205
(Dawsey) 'They were slaves.
Thousands of them.

51:00.833 --> 51:05.328
'Sent by the Reich to labour.
From Poland, Russia.

51:05.458 --> 51:08.292
'Worked all day, all night.

51:08.417 --> 51:11.990
'They were kept in pens with the sun
beating down on them and the rain.'

51:12.125 --> 51:14.617
- (Groans)
- (Man shouts in German)

51:14.750 --> 51:17.288
(Dawsey) 'You wouldn't even
treat animals like that.'

51:18.625 --> 51:20.833
We islanders almost starved.

51:21.792 --> 51:23.579
But they did.

51:23.708 --> 51:27.122
Starved and... and died.

51:32.083 --> 51:33.824
Dawsey...

51:33.958 --> 51:36.951
I know that this is
none of my business, but...

51:37.083 --> 51:39.040
Can you tell me
why Elizabeth was sent away?

51:41.167 --> 51:42.908
What happened?

51:44.042 --> 51:46.955
She helped someone and was arrested.

51:47.875 --> 51:49.537
Helped someone?

51:49.667 --> 51:53.911
Well, do you have any idea where she is?
Have you not even heard from her?

52:02.833 --> 52:04.415
(Man) Anything else for you, mate?

52:11.417 --> 52:13.374
- Hello.
- Oh, Juliet!

52:13.500 --> 52:15.913
What a nice surprise.
I... I thought you'd left.

52:16.042 --> 52:18.955
No, not quite yet.
And sadly not without some of your gin.

52:19.083 --> 52:20.324
Ah...

52:20.458 --> 52:22.541
I wanted to get some
for my friend, Sidney.

52:22.667 --> 52:26.160
Sidney. See, I knew
you had someone in your heart.

52:26.292 --> 52:28.500
- Oh...
- I could tell it when we met.

52:28.625 --> 52:31.868
Well, not... not right when we met,
but shortly after. Such a...

52:32.000 --> 52:33.957
(Inhales)

52:34.083 --> 52:37.406
...strong feeling. What flavour
do you think Sidney would like?

52:37.542 --> 52:39.704
- What are my choices?
- Let's see, we've got anise accented,

52:39.833 --> 52:43.201
- delphinium dusted...
- Isola, how exactly is all this legal?

52:43.333 --> 52:44.824
Oh, I'm not sure it is.

52:45.542 --> 52:48.455
But the, erm,
the Sergeant seems to like it.

52:49.917 --> 52:51.283
- Oh.
- (Chuckles)

52:51.417 --> 52:53.124
(Both laugh)

52:54.625 --> 52:56.457
(Sniffs) Ahh...

52:56.583 --> 52:58.119
(Sniffs) Oh...

52:58.708 --> 53:00.415
- Oh, yes.
- Do you want some?

53:06.875 --> 53:10.915
I did hear about Elizabeth,
that she was arrested.

53:11.958 --> 53:15.201
Do you suppose that's why Amelia
didn't want me to write about the Society?

53:15.333 --> 53:17.074
(Kisses) Good girl.

53:20.125 --> 53:23.664
Is it to do with Elizabeth?
With who she helped?

53:25.750 --> 53:29.744
The thing you need to understand is that
Elizabeth is like another daughter to Amelia.

53:30.417 --> 53:33.251
- Another daughter?
- After Amelia's daughter, Jane.

53:33.375 --> 53:35.617
She and Elizabeth
were the best of friends.

53:35.750 --> 53:39.414
Elizabeth used to visit every summer
from London, since she was a girl.

53:39.542 --> 53:41.625
That's her cottage, over there.

53:45.750 --> 53:48.288
She could have left in 1940,
in the big evacuations,

53:48.417 --> 53:51.489
but... Jane was pregnant.

53:52.292 --> 53:53.828
So she stayed.

53:54.667 --> 53:55.953
For Jane.

53:56.083 --> 53:58.917
Then the Germans struck
and it was too late for everybody.

53:59.042 --> 54:02.331
- (Air-raid siren)
- (Bomb whistles)

54:02.458 --> 54:04.541
(Cries out)

54:04.667 --> 54:06.624
(Explosions in distance)

54:06.750 --> 54:08.491
Do you feel any sickness?

54:09.458 --> 54:11.290
It's OK, sir, it'll be fine.

54:11.417 --> 54:16.583
(Isola) 'And that's where I saw Amelia,
with Elizabeth. At the hospital.

54:16.708 --> 54:21.123
'Jane had got caught in a bombing in town
and went into labour.

54:22.250 --> 54:23.707
'Jane lost the baby.

54:24.625 --> 54:26.366
'And then they lost Jane.'

54:33.208 --> 54:35.951
Leave her. Leave her.

54:53.375 --> 54:55.332
(Isola) 'The Germans
came three days later.'

54:55.458 --> 54:58.417
- (♪ Marching band plays)
- (Man shouts in German)

55:01.083 --> 55:03.996
(Eben) 'We beat them in '18.
Here they are again.

55:04.125 --> 55:06.492
'How did we let this happen?'

55:25.667 --> 55:27.624
(Officer shouts in German)

55:29.875 --> 55:32.333
Shame! Shame on all of you!

55:32.458 --> 55:34.415
- Elizabeth!
- Shame for Poland, France,

55:34.542 --> 55:37.376
- now Guernsey! Shame!
- Come here.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.662
Come here, it's all right.

55:40.375 --> 55:43.868
- It's all right. It's all right. She's fine.
- (Man shouts in German)

55:48.667 --> 55:49.953
(Amelia) Got a bit overexcited.

55:50.083 --> 55:53.155
She's not doing anything,
she's going to stop now. I'm very sorry.

55:53.292 --> 55:56.490
All right, who are you defending?
And whose side are you on?

55:56.625 --> 56:01.120
Both of you! Go on, go about your duties.
Go about your duties!

56:03.208 --> 56:06.872
I've lost two people already.
I can't afford to lose you, too.

56:08.250 --> 56:10.663
(Isola) 'But she has lost her,
hasn't she?

56:10.792 --> 56:13.864
'The Germans have taken Elizabeth.'

56:20.208 --> 56:23.406
That's why I think Amelia
doesn't want to talk about the Society.

56:24.250 --> 56:26.788
Why she wouldn't want anyone
to write about it.

56:26.917 --> 56:29.625
Too painful.
She's lost so much.

56:29.750 --> 56:32.413
- I didn't know.
- The war goes on.

56:33.083 --> 56:35.416
For us. Especially Amelia.

56:39.750 --> 56:43.164
I don't expect it'll really be over
until Elizabeth's home.

56:44.292 --> 56:45.954
And Kit's with her mother again.

56:46.083 --> 56:47.494
(Seagulls cry)

57:06.500 --> 57:08.537
- (Man) Here's the rest of '40 into '41.
- Thank you.

57:44.292 --> 57:45.874
(Exhales)

57:58.833 --> 58:02.076
Mrs Maugery.
Mrs Maugery, good morning.

58:02.208 --> 58:05.747
Miss Ashton, morning.
Thought you'd be gone by now.

58:06.375 --> 58:08.537
Yeah, I'd planned to, but I was...

58:08.667 --> 58:11.000
I was curious
and I wanted to do some research.

58:11.125 --> 58:12.536
Well, don't let me keep you.

58:12.667 --> 58:15.535
- Research on the occupation.
- Yes, I gathered that.

58:15.667 --> 58:19.456
It wouldn't be about the local flora
and fauna, would it, now?

58:20.208 --> 58:23.906
I'm not writing about the Society,
I promise.

58:27.958 --> 58:32.248
I lost people too, Mrs Maugery.
People I miss sorely.

58:32.375 --> 58:35.618
- Everyone lost someone in this war.
- My parents.

58:37.250 --> 58:39.742
I know what it is to be
without a mother.

58:39.875 --> 58:42.743
If you'd let me,
I'd like to try and help.

58:42.875 --> 58:47.245
Do whatever I can to find Elizabeth
and bring her home.

58:47.375 --> 58:48.832
For Kit.

58:50.417 --> 58:51.908
Please.

58:55.875 --> 58:59.494
(Juliet) 'M-C-K-E-N-N-A.

58:59.625 --> 59:02.618
'Elizabeth Anne McKenna.

59:02.750 --> 59:05.663
'British national. 28 years old.'

59:06.500 --> 59:08.162
Do you have the date of her deportation?

59:08.292 --> 59:11.911
No, not exactly. She was...
She was arrested on June 11th.

59:12.042 --> 59:13.374
June 11th.

59:13.500 --> 59:14.741
- 'They think she was sent...'
- Hey!

59:14.875 --> 59:16.662
'They think she was sent off-island

59:16.792 --> 59:19.751
- 'sometime in the following few days.'
- Do you know where she was sent?

59:19.875 --> 59:22.242
No, only to the Continent.

59:22.375 --> 59:24.492
(Markham) 'Has anyone
heard anything since?'

59:26.292 --> 59:28.830
- No.
- 'I'll, erm...

59:30.167 --> 59:33.615
- 'If anyone can do it, we can.'
- (Sighs) Mark, thank you.

59:34.333 --> 59:38.748
'The war's not over for them. It won't be.
Not until this child's mother is home.

59:38.875 --> 59:40.912
'Until then, all they can do is wait.'

59:41.042 --> 59:43.910
Well, I do know a little something
about what that's like.

59:44.042 --> 59:47.490
(Chuckles) I told you,
just another day or so.

59:47.625 --> 59:50.493
Right, right, right, right.
Researching, I got it.

59:50.625 --> 59:52.912
You can't blame me
for being a little impatient.

59:53.042 --> 59:55.250
You know, I put a ring on a girl
and she disappeared.

59:55.375 --> 59:57.992
(Chuckles) Well, she's right here.
Back soon.

59:58.125 --> 01:00:00.663
Back by Wednesday.
We're having dinner with the Cavanaghs.

01:00:00.792 --> 01:00:02.658
(Juliet laughs) 'Best efforts.'

01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:04.624
(Pigs squeal)

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.241
(Kit) Come on, piggy.

01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:08.116
(Juliet) Come on, piggy. Come on.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:11.743
- (Dawsey) Come on. Come here. Ready?
- (Pig squeals)

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.413
(Pig continues squealing)

01:00:14.542 --> 01:00:16.454
- (Juliet laughs) It's a bit loud.
- (Laughs)

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:20.500
(Dawsey) Take it.
You know, you can hold it.

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:24.244
(Juliet laughs) Right. Oh!

01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:30.916
- (Juliet laughs)
- (Dawsey) You know it now.

01:00:31.042 --> 01:00:33.125
Dawsey, I think
you may have a problem. (Laughs)

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.537
(Dawsey) All right. That's good.
You stay here.

01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:37.704
Kit, the pigs have gone wild!

01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:57.124
It wouldn't be about them.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.957
Just the occupation.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.242
(Typewriter clicks)

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.082
(Typewriter continues clicking)

01:01:15.208 --> 01:01:17.996
I thought you said they didn't want
to be part of "The Times" article.

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:20.617
(Juliet) "Times" article?
Oh, no. No, no, that's long over.

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.116
I'm talking about...

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.742
I don't know what
I'm talking about yet, but, Sidney...

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:27.947
- (Whispers) It's so compelling.
- (Whispers) That date's gone.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:31.702
As bad as it was for us, these people
had to actually live with their enemy.

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:34.291
(Sidney) 'Any idea
when I might be able to tell someone

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.374
'that you'll pop by their shop
for a reading?'

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.412
I've been talking to the islanders,
to everyone.

01:01:38.542 --> 01:01:40.499
- 'Their personal stories.'
- Juliet.

01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:42.491
All right, I'm all ears.

01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:46.824
I surrender.

01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:52.374
Thank you.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.708
"Dawsey Adams was sentenced
to three weeks in jail

01:01:54.833 --> 01:01:57.541
"for the attack and battery
of Mr Edward Meares."

01:02:00.792 --> 01:02:04.240
Dawsey attacked a man?

01:02:48.708 --> 01:02:50.165
(Juliet whispers) I'm sorry.

01:02:58.042 --> 01:02:59.783
(Floorboard creaks)

01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:07.082
(Charlotte) I see you with them,
and I hear you writing away up there,

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:13.535
and I worry very much what story it is
that they have you putting down.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.496
I'm compiling notes
on the occupation of Guernsey.

01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:22.290
Tall tales of her heroic kindness
and virtue, I'm sure.

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:26.280
Elizabeth McKenna was no saint.

01:03:26.417 --> 01:03:29.251
(Sighs) Well, who among us is?

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:34.700
(Charlotte) Mark me, she will be judged.
Nothing more than a common Jerrybag.

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:37.371
No better than any of those
other little sluts

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.289
who dropped their knickers
for extra rations or for cigarettes.

01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:43.619
For lipsticks!

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.538
Littering the island with their filthy
half-German bastards.

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:48.953
- Half what?
- See?

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:51.541
I knew. I knew
they didn't share that with you.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:58.292
Her adorable little secret being raised
in her absence by that lot.

01:04:00.792 --> 01:04:02.749
Are you sure
she was talking about Elizabeth?

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:04.912
I'm not even going to repeat
what she said.

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:06.578
That is an excellent tack to take.

01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:11.078
Isola, she more than implied,
in the least-polite way,

01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:13.120
that Kit is partly German.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.037
We're all partly something, Juliet.

01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:17.832
And then some.

01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:19.540
Isola...

01:04:20.417 --> 01:04:22.283
- Is Kit Dawsey's child...
- Dawsey's child!

01:04:22.417 --> 01:04:24.158
...or not?

01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:25.828
(Isola clears throat)

01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:30.079
Why does she call him Daddy?

01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:36.159
It's not my story to tell.

01:04:36.292 --> 01:04:39.660
She's four years old.
She needs to call somebody Daddy.

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:42.830
Presumably her father
would be the best candidate.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:45.621
But that's... That's not you.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.037
His name's Christian Hellman.

01:04:52.042 --> 01:04:54.284
And he is a German, Dawsey?

01:04:55.542 --> 01:04:58.990
- A Nazi? Like Charlotte said?
- (Dawsey) No, no. Yes.

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:02.448
Yes, but not like Charlotte said.

01:05:04.542 --> 01:05:05.828
He was my friend.

01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:07.540
(Cow moos)

01:05:07.667 --> 01:05:10.205
(Dawsey) 'Frank Hood
had a milk cow back in '41.

01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:12.370
'Got into trouble bringing in her calf.'

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.039
I don't know why she's carrying on.
I can feel two legs right here.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.082
- And the nose.
- She's a little early.

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:20.540
(Groans) But...

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.204
(Man) I heard the animal from the road.

01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:26.872
It's too noisy for you?
We'll try to keep it down.

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:30.040
What is the matter with her?

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:33.160
Just sorting that out.

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:35.659
You're welcome to put your head inside
if you want to look around.

01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:43.497
We don't want trouble.
We'll register the birth. If it lives...

01:05:43.625 --> 01:05:46.538
I'm a doctor. Let me help.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.082
(Cow moos)

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.915
(Groans)

01:05:51.042 --> 01:05:54.535
- (Dawsey gasps)
- Keep it tight.

01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:57.375
(Dawsey) Two, three... (Groans)

01:05:58.542 --> 01:06:00.283
Good girl, good girl.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.036
Good girl.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.284
(Both strain)

01:06:06.917 --> 01:06:08.078
(Dawsey groans) Come on.

01:06:08.542 --> 01:06:10.454
(Cow moos loudly)

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.366
(Dawsey chuckles)

01:06:21.333 --> 01:06:23.074
- (Cow moos)
- Shh.

01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:26.705
(Dawsey) Good girl. Good girl.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:32.495
- (Calf sneezes)
- It's good.

01:06:33.167 --> 01:06:35.454
She's good. She's good.

01:06:39.292 --> 01:06:41.079
Come on.

01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:43.245
Shh... (Chuckles)

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:52.540
(Christian) Shoulder?

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:56.163
(Dawsey) Got kicked by a horse
when I was a boy.

01:06:57.167 --> 01:06:58.908
Break wasn't set right.

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:02.158
Do you have pain?

01:07:02.292 --> 01:07:04.500
Only because
it keeps me out of a uniform.

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:07.704
Keeps me from fighting you.

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:09.415
(Laughs)

01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:22.785
(Dawsey) The look on Elizabeth's face
when she saw Christian and me together.

01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:24.658
And then I saw Christian's face.

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:29.784
(Chuckles)
It's all right, he's a friend.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:37.535
(Dawsey) I've always wondered which one
of us she meant when she said that.

01:07:39.792 --> 01:07:42.409
They'd met at the hospital
where Christian was stationed.

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:46.530
They knew how dangerous it was,
to both of them.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.866
I should have said more.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.414
I should have told them to be more careful,
but she was happy.

01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:25.662
(Indistinct chatter and laughter)

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:33.371
(Man) Yes, it is. Yes.

01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:38.703
Hello.

01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:41.328
(Clears throat) Hello.

01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:44.375
What... What are you doing in here?

01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:50.033
Well, the menu
at Charlotte Stimple's is... limited.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.375
And you find this an improvement?

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.698
- It's... It's not London.
- I don't mind. I like it.

01:08:58.542 --> 01:08:59.622
Who's with Kit?

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:03.198
Amelia's looking after her.
We've been finishing the hotel roof.

01:09:03.332 --> 01:09:04.868
Ah...

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:09.908
Can I buy you a drink?

01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:13.493
A glass of beer.

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:19.742
(Dawsey) A pint and a half, please.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.457
Here you are.

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:31.283
(Juliet) Thank you.

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:37.080
- (Juliet chuckles) What?
- Well...

01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:41.033
You are not what I expected.

01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:43.578
No?

01:09:43.707 --> 01:09:48.122
How did you imagine me, Mr Adams,
when you wrote me a letter?

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.949
Tweed hunting skirt,
very large in the bottom.

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:56.199
(Laughs)

01:09:56.333 --> 01:10:00.327
Teeth like a horse.
Few wisps of ginger-grey hair.

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:02.495
And glasses thick as jam jars.

01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:05.493
She sounds lovely.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:08.540
And you?

01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:12.034
Who was the pig farmer
you sent books to?

01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:13.829
(Juliet) I did have a couple of ideas.

01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:18.615
But it was more of a sense
that I was writing to someone

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.662
who already understood me.

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:27.288
I didn't have to explain myself to you,
too much.

01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:35.121
(Chuckles)
How many of these have you had?

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:39.540
(Laughs) Oh... Well, I suppose it was
because of Charles Lamb.

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:41.408
- To Charles Lamb, then.
- Yes.

01:10:41.542 --> 01:10:45.240
"Contented with little,
yet wishing for more."

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.536
Ah.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:49.324
Bravo.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:57.580
(Eli) "The beasts are very wise.

01:10:57.708 --> 01:10:59.825
"Their mouths are clean of lies.

01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:04.123
"But man, with goad and whip,
breaks up their fellowship.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:05.912
"When he has ploughed his land,

01:11:06.042 --> 01:11:07.749
"he says, 'They understand.'

01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:10.955
"But the beasts in stall together,

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:15.327
"freed from the yoke and tether,
say, as the torn flanks smoke,

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:19.122
- "'Nay, 'twas the whip that spoke.'"
- Oh...

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:20.331
(Eben) Well read, Eli.

01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:24.034
(Isola) Really well done.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.536
He told you about Christian.

01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:39.408
You know.

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:42.249
Some, yes.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:48.906
Why don't you put the kettle on?
I'll see the others out.

01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:53.283
(Indistinct chattering)

01:11:53.417 --> 01:11:56.910
Oh! Come and give me a kiss.
Good girl.

01:11:58.458 --> 01:12:03.283
I was so against him
when she brought him here for a meeting.

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:08.281
"'Rot you!' murmured the man,
in a horrible passion

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.082
- "between his clenched teeth.
- (Laughter)

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:14.120
"'If I had only had the courage
to say the word,

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.833
"'I might have been free of you
in a night.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:21.498
"'Curses on your head,
and black death on your heart, you imp!

01:12:21.625 --> 01:12:23.662
"'What are you doing here?'

01:12:23.792 --> 01:12:28.412
"The man shook his fist
as he uttered these words incoherently."

01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:31.785
- Do you not care that I love him?
- It disgusts me.

01:12:32.667 --> 01:12:36.115
- He killed Jane. He killed my husband.
- Christian didn't kill them.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.037
Yes, he did.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.707
They did.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.207
Elizabeth...

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:49.034
Please don't put us through this.

01:12:50.542 --> 01:12:52.033
Just end it.

01:12:52.917 --> 01:12:54.499
- I can't.
- Why? Why can't you?

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:56.491
Because I don't want to!

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.871
And I couldn't, anyway.

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:06.534
- Elizabeth.
- (Door opens)

01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:07.908
Elizabeth!

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:10.034
(Elizabeth runs away)

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:28.832
(Amelia) Christian was discovered
sneaking into the camp that night.

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:33.035
They shipped him off the next day.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.618
So I got my wish, didn't I?

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:44.037
They never did see each other again.

01:13:46.292 --> 01:13:50.832
His ship was torpedoed
just shy of the coast.

01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:54.579
He died.

01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:57.166
Now he's at the bottom of the sea.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.707
Like my husband.

01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:04.831
Lost in a sea of mud on the Somme.

01:14:08.458 --> 01:14:11.701
And she hadn't even told him about Kit.

01:14:12.833 --> 01:14:16.622
He didn't know he'd left two behind.

01:14:18.417 --> 01:14:21.910
If there's any shame, it's mine.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.332
All mine.

01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:28.621
I failed Elizabeth when she needed me.

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:32.287
Now all that matters is protecting Kit.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:34.991
Protecting Kit?

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:38.158
From what?

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:44.209
If Elizabeth doesn't come home,
the child's only living relatives...

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:48.161
will be Germans.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.617
- They might come for her.
- No.

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:56.620
But you said yourself that...
that Christian didn't even know about Kit.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.412
And even if he had...

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:03.285
Amelia, Kit is safe.

01:15:03.417 --> 01:15:06.000
- You don't know that.
- I promise you.

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:10.039
I've seen things
I never thought could happen, happen.

01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:15.790
I can't lose another person
to the Germans. I'm sorry.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.616
I can't.

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:14.370
(Juliet gasps)

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:15.991
What do you think you're doing?

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:18.117
(Charlotte) You've fallen to their side.

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:21.664
- I tried to warn you.
- And everybody warned me about you!

01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:25.041
Your soul is in mortal danger.

01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:28.285
Oh, my soul. Thank you.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.374
But it's my privacy I fear for most
just now.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.992
Miss Ashton, let us pray.

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:36.414
I pray you let go of me
before I knock you down.

01:16:36.542 --> 01:16:39.250
Now here is a book filled with love.

01:16:39.917 --> 01:16:44.207
And you overlook all of it in favour of
judgement and petty meanness.

01:16:45.792 --> 01:16:47.328
(Mutters under her breath)

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:50.075
"Seek and ye shall find" indeed!

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:54.825
It is I that shall pray for you,
Miss Stimple.

01:16:56.167 --> 01:16:58.409
But from a far safer distance.

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:07.825
(Animal cries in the distance)

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:21.286
(Knocks on door)

01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:25.366
(Door opens)

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.163
- Juliet?
- (Juliet gasps)

01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:30.783
I have nowhere to go.

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:33.330
(Juliet sobs)

01:17:38.542 --> 01:17:43.037
I think Amelia feels ashamed
because she hated them all so much.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:46.618
She wasn't able to see
that Christian was different...

01:17:47.542 --> 01:17:49.408
the way Elizabeth could.

01:17:49.542 --> 01:17:51.625
And you think Elizabeth was right?

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.366
Oh, I know it.

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:56.912
He was a lovely man.

01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:02.623
All I know of romance in real life
is Elizabeth and Christian.

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:08.200
But tell me about your suitor.

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:09.869
I want to hear all about your Sidney.

01:18:10.917 --> 01:18:11.998
(Laughs)

01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:16.039
Actually, Sidney's my publisher.
And my oldest friend in the world.

01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:19.165
Still, there's a chance?

01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:24.328
There would be a greater chance
if I were called George.

01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:26.915
Or maybe Tom.

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:32.828
- He likes men's names?
- Indeed... he does.

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:37.698
- (Gasps) Oh... Oh.
- (Chuckles) Yes.

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:43.041
Ooh... (Laughs) Thank you.

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.830
And besides, Isola...

01:18:48.542 --> 01:18:51.740
- I'm engaged.
- (Laughs) What?

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:56.164
- To whom?
- Mark, Markham Reynolds.

01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:59.410
- Markham? How elegant.
- He's American.

01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:01.078
Oh. (Laughs)

01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:03.916
But where's the ring?
Or is he very poor?

01:19:04.042 --> 01:19:06.034
- (Gulps)
- That's OK, too.

01:19:19.542 --> 01:19:22.535
- He's not poor.
- No.

01:19:27.958 --> 01:19:30.496
Why aren't you wearing it?

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:32.412
Well, I...

01:19:32.542 --> 01:19:35.034
I'm not yet used to it,
I suppose.

01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:38.410
- And I wanted to keep it safe.
- (Laughs)

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:43.831
So, what sort of books
does Markham enjoy?

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.037
Erm... Have you...

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:53.533
shared a passionate encounter?

01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:55.828
Isola!

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:59.122
I have never shared
a passionate encounter, myself.

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:00.286
(Chuckles)

01:20:00.417 --> 01:20:03.000
(Isola) I am only beautiful
on the inside.

01:20:03.125 --> 01:20:06.197
You are beautiful
on the outside as well.

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:09.292
- And men do like that.
- Nonsense.

01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:11.204
There must be someone here you like.

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:14.997
No. (Chuckles) Not at present.

01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:17.412
But I have "Wuthering Heights", don't I?

01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:20.750
(Juliet) Do you not mind being alone?

01:20:22.292 --> 01:20:25.205
I suppose. Sometimes.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.787
But then I think
how much sweeter it'll be

01:20:28.917 --> 01:20:32.035
when my Heathcliff
finally shows himself.

01:20:32.167 --> 01:20:36.411
And how glad I'll be
that I decided to wait for him.

01:20:39.542 --> 01:20:41.249
Careful!

01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:44.163
- Good, you're here.
- (Juliet) Hello.

01:20:44.292 --> 01:20:46.375
- You busy?
- No.

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.538
New glass for the greenhouse
just came into the port today.

01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:52.626
I was going to help unload,
but I need someone to fetch Kit home.

01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:54.874
Oh, I'd be happy to!

01:20:55.458 --> 01:20:57.120
(Man) Eddie, blast your eyes. Get out!

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:59.993
- (Eddie) All right.
- (Man) Go on, get off.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.912
Are you sure it's no trouble?

01:21:08.042 --> 01:21:09.158
Absolutely not.

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:10.828
- Thank you.
- Oh...

01:21:10.958 --> 01:21:13.075
<i>- À la prochaine!</i>
- Oh, right.

01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:15.825
- (Kit) Come on.
- Kit, slow down. Wait for me!

01:21:17.333 --> 01:21:18.824
(Juliet squeals)

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.454
(Juliet chuckles)

01:21:22.667 --> 01:21:26.991
(Kit) Away! Away, away.

01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:32.037
- (Kit screams)
- (Juliet laughs)

01:21:57.292 --> 01:21:58.783
(Pigs snort)

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.870
(Juliet) Kit!

01:22:24.458 --> 01:22:26.825
(Kit) Juliet! Up here!

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:31.875
Do you want to see my treasure box?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.036
(Gasps)

01:22:41.167 --> 01:22:42.578
(Sniffs)

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.324
Hmm, delicious.

01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:54.037
(Kit) This is me and my mummy.

01:22:54.958 --> 01:22:59.202
She loves me very much,
but she can't be here right now.

01:23:00.333 --> 01:23:03.201
And she'll come back as soon as she can.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:05.699
Oh...

01:23:14.833 --> 01:23:16.369
She's very pretty.

01:23:17.333 --> 01:23:18.699
(Chuckles)

01:23:27.542 --> 01:23:30.614
Oh... Thank you.

01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:26.496
(Footsteps approach)

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.743
(Juliet) Such a small thing.
Just a book.

01:24:41.792 --> 01:24:43.829
Yet it's brought me all this way.

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:10.500
Er, Kit's in her room, sleeping.

01:25:10.625 --> 01:25:12.617
Thank you for watching her.

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:14.742
We had a lovely time.

01:25:16.208 --> 01:25:18.825
She's... She's fond of you.

01:25:22.708 --> 01:25:24.324
I best get back.

01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:33.324
- (Juliet) Morning.
- (Man) Morning.

01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:35.825
- (Eli) Miss! Miss Ashton!
- Yes?

01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:38.792
There's a call for you at the post office
from a Mark Reynolds.

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:43.616
- (Ringing tone)
- (Sighs)

01:25:46.833 --> 01:25:49.041
(Sighs)

01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:53.163
- (Eben) Not picking up?
- No. He left no message?

01:25:53.292 --> 01:25:55.249
(Eben) No, sorry. We'll try again later.

01:25:55.375 --> 01:25:58.994
Oh, no. No, it's all right.

01:25:59.125 --> 01:26:03.039
Just, er, if he calls back,
let him know I'm over at the newspap...

01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:04.991
- Eben?
- Hm-hmm?

01:26:05.667 --> 01:26:07.203
I hope you don't mind me asking,

01:26:07.333 --> 01:26:09.416
but who is that man
that's always skulking about?

01:26:09.542 --> 01:26:10.908
(Eben) That one?

01:26:11.042 --> 01:26:14.831
- He steers a wide path of Dawsey.
- Yeah, I shouldn't wonder.

01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:19.032
That's Eddie Meares.
The fellow who informed on Elizabeth.

01:26:19.167 --> 01:26:22.706
- Informed on Elizabeth?
- Among others.

01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:24.290
(Bell rings)

01:26:25.708 --> 01:26:27.244
Morning.

01:26:27.375 --> 01:26:29.287
(Eben) Yeah, he profited nicely
during the war,

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:30.908
but he's paying the price now.

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:32.408
Look at him.

01:26:32.542 --> 01:26:34.784
He's the man Dawsey attacked.

01:26:34.917 --> 01:26:38.035
Oh, that was a beautiful thing to see.

01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:41.001
Should have sold tickets.
(Chuckles)

01:26:41.125 --> 01:26:43.208
(Indistinct chatter)

01:26:44.292 --> 01:26:45.373
(Eben) Steady, lad. Steady.

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.993
New jacket, Eddie?
You're doing all right for yourself.

01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:53.993
- Can't help if business is good.
- Oh, Eddie, what business is that?

01:26:54.125 --> 01:26:57.368
I'd say that jacket's made
of Elizabeth McKenna's hide.

01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.332
What business would that be
of any of yours?

01:27:01.458 --> 01:27:03.120
That Jerrybag wasn't even from here.

01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:06.288
It's just too bad they didn't ship
her wee bastard off with her.

01:27:08.292 --> 01:27:09.703
- (Groans)
- (People gasp)

01:27:10.417 --> 01:27:11.953
You're the bastard, Meares.

01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:14.699
Or did I get it wrong, Adams?

01:27:14.833 --> 01:27:16.870
Maybe you shared her
with your Nazi friend.

01:27:18.583 --> 01:27:19.915
(Groans)

01:27:20.542 --> 01:27:21.828
(Man) Leave it, Dawsey!

01:27:22.542 --> 01:27:26.456
They had to give him three weeks,
but he only served one.

01:27:26.583 --> 01:27:29.075
I'd have done it for him if I could.

01:27:29.708 --> 01:27:31.449
And that one...

01:27:31.583 --> 01:27:35.406
He has to live with himself now.
God help him.

01:27:40.042 --> 01:27:43.615
Why does Kit live with you
rather than Amelia or...?

01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:45.958
Because Elizabeth left her with me.

01:27:47.542 --> 01:27:49.033
But why?

01:27:52.875 --> 01:27:54.366
Dawsey...

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.082
What happened?

01:27:56.208 --> 01:27:58.951
(Kit) Piggies. Pig.

01:27:59.083 --> 01:28:03.202
She came to the house that night.
The night she was arrested.

01:28:04.042 --> 01:28:09.333
One of the slave workers, a boy,
had escaped somehow.

01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:10.539
She found him.

01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:14.246
He was hurt, sick.

01:28:15.167 --> 01:28:17.159
He needed help.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.284
(Kit) Come on, piggy.

01:28:19.417 --> 01:28:21.909
- So, she brought Kit.
- (Kit) Pig...

01:28:22.042 --> 01:28:26.833
Would I watch her
while she went for supplies?

01:28:26.958 --> 01:28:30.030
You can't go running around the island
after curfew.

01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:33.040
- I don't have a choice.
- Of course you do.

01:28:33.167 --> 01:28:36.239
You have a choice,
you have a responsibility.

01:28:36.375 --> 01:28:38.367
I won't do it.
You can't leave her here.

01:28:38.917 --> 01:28:41.159
- Do you have any bread?
- Take her to Amelia or Isola.

01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:43.409
I will be gone for 20 minutes.

01:28:43.542 --> 01:28:44.783
Do you have any bread?

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.116
(Dawsey) Elizabeth...

01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:03.833
Because you give me
the last piece of bread when I ask.

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:08.416
That is why I trust her to you.

01:29:14.417 --> 01:29:15.703
Elizabeth!

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.082
- Elizabeth!
- Shh, Dawsey. Go back!

01:29:18.208 --> 01:29:20.996
You can't risk it, it's too dangerous.
You have a child.

01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:22.457
This is someone's child, too.

01:29:22.583 --> 01:29:24.666
How could I look his mother
in the eye if I didn't help?

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.454
You will never meet her!

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:29.951
If I don't help him, he will die.
Would you have me look the other way?

01:29:30.083 --> 01:29:31.199
(Dawsey) Yes, please.

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:32.699
- I can't!
- Please.

01:29:34.458 --> 01:29:36.871
I'll go. Tell me what you need
from the hospital.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.241
They'll never let you in.

01:29:38.375 --> 01:29:41.413
I'll be back.
Two shakes of a lamb's tail.

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:44.286
(Exhales)

01:29:54.667 --> 01:29:56.579
They shot him by the side of the road.

01:29:59.167 --> 01:30:00.578
(Dogs bark in the distance)

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:03.041
- (Soldier shouts in German)
- (Gunshot)

01:30:06.042 --> 01:30:07.999
(Dawsey) And they arrested Elizabeth.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.583
I should have nailed her to the floor.

01:30:14.125 --> 01:30:15.457
But I let her go.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:18.287
It's not your fault.

01:30:19.125 --> 01:30:21.082
- It is.
- Dawsey...

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:26.201
It's not fair, the choice she made.

01:30:27.083 --> 01:30:29.450
To Kit, to you.

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:34.030
You're raising this child
all by yourself.

01:30:34.167 --> 01:30:35.908
But I... I, I love her.

01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:39.371
(Kit) Rise and shine. (Chuckles)

01:30:44.375 --> 01:30:45.456
I love Kit.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.741
Do you love Elizabeth?

01:30:56.458 --> 01:30:59.166
- (Man) Whoa. Whoa there, boy.
- (Markham) Juliet!

01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:03.204
Mark? Mark!

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:08.117
Mark! (Laughs)
What are you doing here?

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:19.411
(Juliet laughs)

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:22.329
- (Markham) Hi.
- (Dawsey) Hello.

01:31:22.458 --> 01:31:24.541
How you doing? Mark Reynolds.

01:31:25.375 --> 01:31:26.991
Dawsey Adams.

01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:30.368
The letter-writing pig farmer?
Fellow bibliophile.

01:31:31.042 --> 01:31:32.578
It's good to meet you.

01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:37.615
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- What are you doing here?

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:40.333
If you ask me that again,
I'm gonna feel a little unwelcome.

01:31:40.458 --> 01:31:41.994
I missed you.
I hope that's enough.

01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:48.119
More than enough.
I'm just surprised. (Chuckles)

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:51.448
- That's all.
- Well, I tried to call you yesterday.

01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:54.041
And I thought, you know,
why not hop on a flight?

01:31:54.167 --> 01:31:56.830
Come see what's so fascinating here
for myself.

01:31:57.542 --> 01:31:59.784
I have some idea now.

01:32:01.958 --> 01:32:03.950
- You know, it's a beautiful island.
- Yes.

01:32:04.083 --> 01:32:07.827
- It's just lacking a proper florist.
- Oh!

01:32:10.167 --> 01:32:11.203
All the way from London.

01:32:11.333 --> 01:32:14.326
(Juliet) Mark, they're beautiful.
Thank you.

01:32:16.083 --> 01:32:17.949
How about a private tour?

01:32:18.083 --> 01:32:19.574
Yes.

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:22.832
Absolutely.

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:29.370
- Nice to meet you.
- (Dawsey) Yes.

01:32:34.292 --> 01:32:36.625
(Juliet) Do you see the one
with the greenhouse? That's Isola's.

01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:38.867
That's where I've been staying
this past week.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.083
Do you see it?
It's the one with the garden.

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.162
Have you lost the ring I gave you?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.707
No, I haven't.

01:32:46.833 --> 01:32:48.699
Have you changed your mind?

01:32:51.875 --> 01:32:54.492
- No.
- Then why aren't you wearing it?

01:32:55.875 --> 01:32:58.162
Because I am afraid of losing it.

01:32:58.292 --> 01:33:00.158
I can... I can only imagine
what it cost.

01:33:00.292 --> 01:33:02.830
And I... I wanted to keep it safe.

01:33:04.708 --> 01:33:08.201
- And I'll... I'll tell you the truth.
- That would be great.

01:33:10.792 --> 01:33:15.958
I feel like I'm lording about,
with a great gold crown on my forehead.

01:33:16.083 --> 01:33:17.870
Can you understand that?

01:33:18.833 --> 01:33:21.200
My good fortune feels... (Sighs)

01:33:22.583 --> 01:33:24.575
It feels so conspicuous here.

01:33:24.708 --> 01:33:27.746
I take it gold crowns
aren't the fashion on Guernsey?

01:33:29.042 --> 01:33:31.079
Or maybe just not on pig farms.

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:40.413
Or maybe you'd like to take it back.

01:33:45.917 --> 01:33:48.250
More than anything,
I just wanna see it on you.

01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:51.245
Right here, where I put it.

01:33:55.583 --> 01:33:57.575
Unless there's something
you wanna tell me.

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:10.454
Good.

01:34:10.583 --> 01:34:12.870
(Sighs) Now, the real reason I came...

01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:32.327
Mark was able to trace her
to a camp in Ravensbrück.

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:35.121
Wh... Where's Ravensbrück?

01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:36.912
(Markham) Germany.

01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:41.457
(Markham clears throat)

01:34:43.125 --> 01:34:45.583
There are witnesses who saw her.

01:34:46.542 --> 01:34:47.828
Who were there...

01:34:47.958 --> 01:34:49.870
the day she died.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.493
- Do they know how she died?
- She was shot.

01:35:00.542 --> 01:35:03.205
They say she tried to save a girl...

01:35:04.208 --> 01:35:06.040
who was being beaten.

01:35:09.667 --> 01:35:14.662
Elizabeth got the stick from the guard
and she struck him with it.

01:35:16.417 --> 01:35:18.033
The girl was spared.

01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:21.200
But they killed Elizabeth instead.

01:35:26.458 --> 01:35:28.074
I'm so sorry.

01:35:38.458 --> 01:35:41.201
- (Eben) Where are you going, Dawsey?
- To tell Kit.

01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:45.373
Right now? Don't you want
to give yourself a chance to think?

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.082
- Think what?
- What will you tell her?

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:50.076
- I'll do it, Dawsey.
- I will.

01:35:51.042 --> 01:35:52.578
(Eli) Wait.

01:36:05.167 --> 01:36:06.578
(Dawsey) Come on.

01:36:07.542 --> 01:36:09.033
Come here.

01:36:12.583 --> 01:36:13.664
(Exhales)

01:36:14.917 --> 01:36:17.079
She's only four.

01:36:17.208 --> 01:36:20.531
- What can she understand?
- I'm older than time.

01:36:22.875 --> 01:36:25.037
And I understand nothing.

01:36:27.042 --> 01:36:28.533
Nothing.

01:36:30.083 --> 01:36:32.575
(Amelia sobs) Nothing.

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:34.582
(Sobs)

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.162
(Whispers) It's time to go.

01:36:59.542 --> 01:37:03.957
It's not like I can keep putting poor Sidney
and his book tour off forever.

01:37:04.083 --> 01:37:07.372
- I have to get back to London sometime.
- Then there's your Mark.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.823
- Wouldn't want him to go to waste.
- (Juliet) No.

01:37:12.125 --> 01:37:14.788
- You see?
- Hm.

01:37:14.917 --> 01:37:16.704
There's nothing to keep you here.

01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:19.415
No.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:22.205
- My life's in London.
- Yes, it is.

01:37:25.042 --> 01:37:29.286
I'm afraid how lonely it's going to feel now,
when you're gone.

01:37:29.417 --> 01:37:30.953
(Isola sobs)

01:37:31.083 --> 01:37:34.702
It's terrible to lose a friend
when you don't have many.

01:38:14.042 --> 01:38:15.783
Thank you.

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.207
I'm so sorry, Amelia.

01:38:36.417 --> 01:38:39.706
- Bye, Miss.
- (Juliet) Keep going with the Kipling.

01:38:39.833 --> 01:38:41.369
Goodbye.

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:44.579
I'll miss you.

01:38:45.417 --> 01:38:47.374
I'll miss all of you.

01:38:55.333 --> 01:38:57.290
This is yours.

01:39:00.375 --> 01:39:02.287
I'd like you to keep that.

01:39:06.583 --> 01:39:09.041
- Juliet, I'll be on board.
- (Juliet) Yes.

01:39:09.167 --> 01:39:12.205
- Mr Adams, it was nice to meet you.
- (Kit) Bye-bye, Juliet.

01:39:13.333 --> 01:39:14.369
(Whispers) Bye, Kit.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.161
Kit.

01:39:27.958 --> 01:39:29.790
We'll still write to each other,
won't we?

01:39:29.917 --> 01:39:31.704
Yes, of course.

01:39:38.458 --> 01:39:41.292
- (Plane engine starts)
- Goodbye.

01:40:10.792 --> 01:40:11.873
(Buckle clicks)

01:41:12.375 --> 01:41:14.082
Thank goodness you're here, Mr Stark.

01:41:14.208 --> 01:41:17.280
Poor thing. She's not eating,
and she's as quiet as a mouse.

01:41:17.417 --> 01:41:19.579
Well, let's see what we can fix.

01:41:19.708 --> 01:41:22.325
(Mrs Burns) I can tell you, the silence
is worse than the typing ever was.

01:41:22.458 --> 01:41:23.494
(Sidney) Hmm.

01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.207
You have to write about them.

01:41:30.333 --> 01:41:33.747
I can't. I promised I wouldn't.

01:41:33.875 --> 01:41:38.074
I realise that, Juliet,
but this is your story to tell,

01:41:38.208 --> 01:41:42.407
as sure as I'm sitting here,
and you will not be right until you do.

01:41:43.708 --> 01:41:47.907
Now, Elizabeth, for better or worse,
couldn't help but follow her heart.

01:41:48.042 --> 01:41:49.749
You must do the same.

01:41:50.958 --> 01:41:53.041
I'm afraid. (Shudders)

01:41:53.833 --> 01:41:56.371
- What if I'm not a good enough writer?
- Ah.

01:41:57.708 --> 01:41:59.244
She doubts.

01:42:00.542 --> 01:42:02.283
She doesn't believe.

01:42:05.167 --> 01:42:09.832
She craves being taken seriously,
but then she won't do that for herself.

01:42:12.375 --> 01:42:14.412
I think you're better than you yet know.

01:42:15.583 --> 01:42:18.781
And as your friend, of many, many...

01:42:19.875 --> 01:42:22.083
- many years...
- (Juliet sobs)

01:42:26.667 --> 01:42:29.034
(Sidney) I've seen you reach
for what you want.

01:42:30.292 --> 01:42:32.500
You have that courage.

01:42:42.708 --> 01:42:44.916
- (♪ Piano plays)
- (Laughter)

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:07.037
You look absolutely ravishing.

01:43:07.167 --> 01:43:08.829
Thank you.

01:43:08.958 --> 01:43:10.415
We...

01:43:11.542 --> 01:43:13.408
need to celebrate.

01:43:19.542 --> 01:43:21.033
(Juliet exhales)

01:43:22.083 --> 01:43:23.290
- To us.
- (Glasses clink)

01:43:32.542 --> 01:43:35.285
- (Exhales)
- Juliet, what is it?

01:43:38.208 --> 01:43:40.825
Mark, I'm sorry.

01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:47.874
I am very sorry.

01:43:59.542 --> 01:44:03.456
OK, is my mistake
bringing you back too quickly

01:44:03.583 --> 01:44:05.324
or letting you go to Guernsey
in the first place?

01:44:06.250 --> 01:44:08.458
I should have never let you
out of my sight.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.414
I think I would have found myself here
sooner or later,

01:44:13.542 --> 01:44:15.534
even if I'd gone nowhere.

01:44:16.875 --> 01:44:18.707
I am sorry, Mark.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.707
May I ask if you ever loved me?

01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:29.207
I loved our time together.

01:44:29.333 --> 01:44:32.121
- And I still truly care for you.
- It's not really the same thing, is it?

01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:35.823
- But I feel terribly...
- Well, I am really sorry about that.

01:44:36.792 --> 01:44:39.079
Mark, as unhappy with me
as you are right now,

01:44:39.208 --> 01:44:41.245
being married to me
would not have made you happy.

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:43.788
I'd just as soon as you not tell me
what would make me happy.

01:44:43.917 --> 01:44:45.328
I got a better beat on that than you.

01:44:45.458 --> 01:44:47.245
And you deserve someone
who can share that.

01:44:47.375 --> 01:44:50.038
Who can share every wonderful thing
you have to offer.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.538
- You deserve better.
- Well, I deserve better than I got.

01:44:55.333 --> 01:44:56.744
I'll give you that.

01:44:58.917 --> 01:45:00.408
And you will have it.

01:45:00.542 --> 01:45:03.956
I'm sure I will.
But not at this table. Goodnight.

01:45:13.292 --> 01:45:15.500
(Sighs) Goodbye, Mark.

01:45:19.792 --> 01:45:21.249
(Exhales)

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.707
Goodbye, Juliet.

01:45:51.292 --> 01:45:52.783
(Sighs)

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.957
(Typewriter clicks)

01:46:18.958 --> 01:46:20.995
(Typewriter continues clicking)

01:46:21.125 --> 01:46:22.536
(Gasps)

01:46:22.667 --> 01:46:25.000
(Typewriter continues clicking)

01:46:36.458 --> 01:46:38.450
(Exhales)

01:46:43.667 --> 01:46:45.408
(Groans)

01:46:54.250 --> 01:46:55.786
(Typewriter clicks)

01:47:05.250 --> 01:47:06.536
(Sighs)

01:47:27.333 --> 01:47:29.245
(Typewriter clicks)

01:47:45.958 --> 01:47:46.994
(Bell tings)

01:47:49.583 --> 01:47:54.408
(Sidney) "The Guernsey Literary
and Potato Peel Pie Society."

01:47:55.458 --> 01:47:57.074
Crikey, that's quite a mouthful.

01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:59.161
- No author?
- (Juliet) No.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.787
You can't ever publish it anyway.

01:48:01.917 --> 01:48:04.159
You'd need permission
and it's not mine to give.

01:48:05.125 --> 01:48:06.582
(Sighs) This is just for you.

01:48:06.708 --> 01:48:08.244
Thank you.

01:48:09.167 --> 01:48:11.124
- (Juliet) But...
- Hmm?

01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:14.869
I will write you another book.
Possibly another after that.

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.412
This makes me excessively happy to hear.

01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:21.662
(Sighs) Something's opened up, Sidney.

01:48:21.792 --> 01:48:25.160
Somehow the "doing" has given me
a tremendous appetite for more.

01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:29.366
Which brings me to a business question.

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.332
Business? Good.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.741
I'm all ears.

01:48:35.083 --> 01:48:38.747
Have I still got a little money?

01:48:39.458 --> 01:48:41.450
- Ah...
- (Chuckles)

01:48:41.583 --> 01:48:43.040
No.

01:48:43.708 --> 01:48:46.121
No, you're quite rich. (Chuckles)

01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:47.707
Huh!

01:48:47.833 --> 01:48:49.916
Well, I only need some.

01:48:50.042 --> 01:48:52.750
There's a property
I may be interested in buying.

01:48:54.333 --> 01:48:56.871
(Sighs) But I need to go and see
if it's still available

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.992
and if they'll have me.

01:49:00.542 --> 01:49:03.080
Darling girl,
anyone would be lucky to have you.

01:49:04.917 --> 01:49:07.580
And I am so lucky to have you.

01:49:07.708 --> 01:49:09.290
Hmm.

01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:13.831
(Sighs)

01:49:14.542 --> 01:49:16.955
True. (Chuckles)

01:49:17.083 --> 01:49:18.540
- All right, all right.
- (Chuckles)

01:49:18.667 --> 01:49:21.034
Off you go.
I'm a very busy man.

01:49:21.167 --> 01:49:22.908
All right.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.332
Just so you know...

01:49:29.292 --> 01:49:31.534
I'm still available to give you away.

01:49:32.833 --> 01:49:35.541
Should the occasion ever present itself.

01:49:37.125 --> 01:49:38.661
Thank you, Sidney.

01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:40.991
For all of it.

01:49:57.333 --> 01:49:58.915
Granddad?

01:50:00.125 --> 01:50:02.333
It's addressed to the Society.

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:08.369
From Juliet.

01:50:35.542 --> 01:50:39.161
- Out loud, son. Out loud.
- (Dawsey clears throat)

01:50:41.083 --> 01:50:46.033
"Dear Dawsey, Amelia, Isola,

01:50:46.167 --> 01:50:48.534
"Eben, Eli and Kit.

01:50:50.167 --> 01:50:52.910
- "Please forgive me."
- Oh, whatever for?

01:50:53.042 --> 01:50:54.658
(Dawsey) "That's first.

01:50:54.792 --> 01:50:57.159
"I hope you will forgive me
breaking the promise I made

01:50:57.292 --> 01:50:59.500
"not to write about your Society.

01:51:00.458 --> 01:51:03.530
"We had a trust I am profoundly sorry
to have betrayed.

01:51:04.875 --> 01:51:08.664
"Secondly, know that this manuscript

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:12.368
"is yours alone
to do with what you will.

01:51:13.417 --> 01:51:16.831
"I will not publish it.
That's not why I wrote it.

01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:22.698
"'Earth seemed a desert
I was bound to traverse,

01:51:22.833 --> 01:51:26.702
"'seeking to find the old familiar faces,'
Charles Lamb wrote."

01:51:26.833 --> 01:51:27.869
It's Charles Lamb.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.538
(Juliet) 'Without knowing it,
I feel I have been searching

01:51:30.667 --> 01:51:33.831
'for the old familiar faces
for many years now,

01:51:33.958 --> 01:51:37.372
'and can't quite account for
why I recognise these as yours.'

01:51:38.208 --> 01:51:39.244
(Sighs)

01:51:39.375 --> 01:51:41.162
- 'But I do.'
- But I do.

01:51:42.292 --> 01:51:45.251
"Do you suppose it's possible for us
to already belong to someone

01:51:45.375 --> 01:51:47.412
"before we've met them?"

01:51:47.542 --> 01:51:49.124
Oh, very much so, yes.

01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:54.541
"If so, I belong to you,
or you to me,

01:51:54.667 --> 01:51:58.832
"or me simply to the spirit
I found among you on Guernsey.

01:51:58.958 --> 01:52:02.531
"That is as good a definition of family
as any I know."

01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:07.324
(Juliet) 'Thank you for sharing
the story of your family with me.

01:52:07.458 --> 01:52:09.916
'And for sharing Elizabeth.

'Though I did not get
to meet her myself,

'I feel keenly how her life has changed

"Love, Juliet."

The Guernsey Literary
and Potato Peel Pie Society.

01:52:51.875 --> 01:52:53.241
That's my name.

01:52:55.042 --> 01:52:57.159
It is. (Chuckles)

01:52:57.292 --> 01:53:00.160
- Will you read it to me?
- I will.

01:53:01.167 --> 01:53:03.329
Another time, all right?

01:53:05.458 --> 01:53:06.619
Who will look after her?

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:09.117
- I will.
- Eli, drive me to the port?

01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:12.288
- I can still make the 11 o'clock boat.
- (Isola) Where are you going?

01:53:12.417 --> 01:53:14.124
London. Wherever she is.

01:53:14.958 --> 01:53:19.658
You stop her, Dawsey. You stop her.
Don't let her marry that Yank.

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:21.533
- (Hiccups)
- I don't believe she is.

01:53:21.667 --> 01:53:23.829
- How do you know?
- She told us.

01:53:25.958 --> 01:53:28.450
Mind Amelia. I'll be back soon.

01:53:28.583 --> 01:53:30.415
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:53:30.542 --> 01:53:32.408
Well, where does she say that?

01:53:36.292 --> 01:53:40.081
Come on. Let's go and make some cakes
for when they get back.

01:53:40.208 --> 01:53:41.790
Amelia, are you not going to read this?

01:53:41.917 --> 01:53:45.490
I don't care for everyone
to see me crying. I will later.

01:53:49.542 --> 01:53:51.033
(Juliet) Excuse me, sorry.

01:53:55.167 --> 01:53:57.159
Sorry.

01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:07.207
Thank you.

01:54:22.875 --> 01:54:24.958
Dawsey? Daw... Dawsey!

01:54:28.958 --> 01:54:30.790
Excuse me. Dawsey!

01:54:31.667 --> 01:54:33.249
Sorry. Sorry.

01:54:34.542 --> 01:54:36.579
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:54:36.708 --> 01:54:38.074
Dawsey!

01:54:42.458 --> 01:54:44.495
(Loud chatter)

01:54:48.583 --> 01:54:49.915
Dawsey!

01:54:54.208 --> 01:54:55.574
Dawsey!

01:54:58.833 --> 01:55:00.165
(Juliet chuckles)

01:55:00.292 --> 01:55:02.124
Oh, Juliet.

01:55:09.375 --> 01:55:10.411
Hello.

01:55:13.083 --> 01:55:14.164
Where are you off to?

01:55:16.375 --> 01:55:19.118
I'm on my way to find you.

01:55:20.417 --> 01:55:21.783
Me?

01:55:22.875 --> 01:55:25.242
- Really?
- Yes.

01:55:27.042 --> 01:55:29.534
Well, I wrote you a letter
on the boat just now.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.242
Wanted to make sure I'd got it all down.

01:55:34.875 --> 01:55:38.289
Everything I should have said
long before.

01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.287
Well...

01:55:43.417 --> 01:55:47.491
This is convenient because I was
on my way to find you as well.

01:55:52.417 --> 01:55:53.453
Juliet...

01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:56.541
- I...
- Would you like to marry me?

01:56:04.917 --> 01:56:08.706
I'm in love with you.
So I thought I'd ask.

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.742
Wow! My God.

01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:15.457
Yes.

01:56:15.583 --> 01:56:18.246
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:56:23.583 --> 01:56:25.074
(Juliet exhales)

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:37.366
(Chuckles)

01:56:52.292 --> 01:56:56.161
(Dawsey) "Puck had carefully removed
the charm from off the eyes of Lysander

01:56:56.292 --> 01:56:58.955
"with the antidote
the Fairy King gave to him.

01:56:59.083 --> 01:57:01.075
"Hermia first awoke,

01:57:01.208 --> 01:57:04.406
"and finding her lost Lysander
asleep so near her,

01:57:04.542 --> 01:57:08.832
"was looking at him and wondering
at his strange inconstancy.

01:57:08.958 --> 01:57:12.998
"Lysander presently opening his eyes,
and seeing his dear Hermia,

01:57:13.125 --> 01:57:16.573
"recovered his reason which
the fairy charm had before clouded,

01:57:16.708 --> 01:57:21.123
"and with his reason,
his love for Hermia.

01:57:21.250 --> 01:57:24.322
"And they began to talk over
the adventures of the night,

01:57:24.458 --> 01:57:27.906
"doubting if these things
had really happened,

01:57:28.042 --> 01:57:31.456
"or if they had both been dreaming
the same bewildering dream."

01:57:49.583 --> 01:57:51.040
(Clock ticks)

01:57:53.708 --> 01:57:55.950
- (Isola) Begin.
- (Amelia) "He was hungry, he said.

01:57:56.083 --> 01:57:57.915
"It was time for lunch.

01:57:58.042 --> 01:58:02.207
"'Besides,' he said, 'there's the Lighthouse.
We're almost there.'"

01:58:02.333 --> 01:58:04.245
(Isola) That's all fine,
but where is the story?

01:58:04.375 --> 01:58:05.411
(Eben) Hear, hear.

01:58:05.542 --> 01:58:08.250
(Amelia) The narrative
is not the author's primary concern.

01:58:08.375 --> 01:58:09.616
(Isola) I understand that.

01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:11.412
(Amelia) Never has been
with Virginia Woolf.

01:58:11.542 --> 01:58:13.534
(Isola) Is it too much to ask
for something to happen?

01:58:13.667 --> 01:58:15.659
(Amelia) It's what's going on
inside the people.

01:58:15.792 --> 01:58:17.408
It's the psychology of the people.

01:58:17.542 --> 01:58:22.116
(Eben) It's the psychology of
the people going on a boat ride, Isola.

01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:24.617
- (Isola) Eben!
- (Alarm clock rings)

01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:27.037
- (Eli) "Who are you?"
- (Eben) "I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am."

01:58:27.167 --> 01:58:29.534
- (Eli) "Were you shipwrecked?"
- (Eben) "Nay, mate."

01:58:29.667 --> 01:58:34.037
"Marooned... three years agone
and lived on goats."

01:58:34.167 --> 01:58:35.203
(Eli) "Three years?"

01:58:35.333 --> 01:58:37.370
- (Eben) "Then berries and oysters."
- (Amelia) "Oysters?"

01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:42.541
(Eben) "Many's the long night
I've dreamt of cheese. Toasted, mostly."

01:58:42.667 --> 01:58:45.000
- (Eli) Well done, Grandpa.
- (Alarm clock rings)

01:58:45.917 --> 01:58:50.457
(Dawsey) "Be not afeared.
The isle is full of noises."

01:58:50.583 --> 01:58:55.829
(Juliet) "Sounds, and sweet airs
that give delight and hurt not.

01:58:55.958 --> 01:58:59.531
"Sometimes a thousand
twangling instruments

01:58:59.667 --> 01:59:03.456
"will hum about mine ears,
and sometimes voices."

01:59:03.583 --> 01:59:05.950
- (Amelia) I love that.
- (Applause)

01:59:06.083 --> 01:59:10.248
(Isola) "I took that dear hand,
held it a moment to my lip."

01:59:10.375 --> 01:59:11.911
- (Kisses)
- (Amelia) Oh!

01:59:13.958 --> 01:59:16.917
(Isola) "We entered the wood
and wended homeward.

01:59:17.042 --> 01:59:19.409
"Reader, I married him."

01:59:19.542 --> 01:59:23.240
(Amelia) If ever there was someone
who earned a happy ending, it was...

01:59:23.375 --> 01:59:24.661
- (Isola) Me!
- (Eben) Bravo!

01:59:24.792 --> 01:59:26.124
(Alarm clock rings)

01:59:26.250 --> 01:59:28.082
(Sidney) "You answer
to the name of Ernest.

01:59:28.208 --> 01:59:30.325
"You look as if your name was Ernest.

01:59:30.458 --> 01:59:33.292
"You are the most earnest-looking
person I ever saw in my life.

01:59:33.417 --> 01:59:37.457
"It is perfectly absurd
you're saying your name isn't Ernest."

01:59:37.583 --> 01:59:39.415
(Juliet) Sidney, bravo!

01:59:39.542 --> 01:59:41.909
(Eben) Would you care for more pie,
Mr Stark?

01:59:42.042 --> 01:59:43.328
(Sidney) No! Gin.

01:59:43.458 --> 01:59:45.290
- (Juliet) Sidney!
- (Isola) Leave it to me.

01:59:45.417 --> 01:59:47.579
(Alarm clock rings)

01:59:47.708 --> 01:59:50.701
(Kit) "When I was three,
I was hardly me.

01:59:50.833 --> 01:59:53.871
"When I was four,
I was not much more.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.413
- "When I was five. I was just..."
- (Juliet) "Alive."

01:59:56.542 --> 01:59:58.078
- (Kit) "Alive."
- (Juliet) Yes.

(Kit) "But now I am six, I'm as..."

02:00:00.833 --> 02:00:03.541
- (Juliet) "Clever."
- (Kit) "Clever as clever.

02:00:03.667 --> 02:00:05.909
"So I think I'll be six now for..."

02:00:06.042 --> 02:00:08.125
- (Juliet) "Ever and ever."
- (Kit) "Ever and ever."

02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:10.617
(Amelia) Oh, you did that beautifully!

02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:13.367
- (Juliet) Bravo!
