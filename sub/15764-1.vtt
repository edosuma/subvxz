01:07.194 --> 01:09.613
This will add nicely to Babi's treasure.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.866
Ah!

01:23.877 --> 01:27.297
- As-salaam alaikum, Uncle Babi.
- Nephew Bab...

01:27.464 --> 01:29.841
My new apprentice, you have arrived.

01:30.008 --> 01:33.095
Welcome to Uncle Babi's humble palace.

01:33.262 --> 01:36.014
Babu is most excited
to learn art of adventure.

01:36.181 --> 01:40.477
Good to hear. Babi is most excited
to teach art of adventure.

01:40.644 --> 01:42.312
Babi always wanted a sidekick.

01:44.982 --> 01:47.943
Wow! Uncle Babi,
look at all your treasures.

01:48.110 --> 01:50.112
Babi like shiny objects.

01:54.616 --> 01:56.368
I want to be great adventurer

01:56.535 --> 01:58.662
and treasure hunter just like you

01:58.829 --> 02:01.164
No more organ grinder
school for Babu.

02:01.331 --> 02:03.417
I will teach you everything I know.

02:03.583 --> 02:07.045
What is the greatest treasure
you ever found, Uncle Babi?

02:07.212 --> 02:08.422
Ohh!

02:08.588 --> 02:12.718
That is a very special story
that Babi has not told anyone.

02:12.884 --> 02:16.888
Tell Babu! Tell Babu, please!

02:17.055 --> 02:20.475
OK. It all happened
when Babi met the Buddies.

02:20.642 --> 02:21.977
You know the Buddies?!

02:22.144 --> 02:24.396
Uncle Babi not only friends
with the Buddies,

02:24.563 --> 02:27.274
but Babi once saved their lives.

02:27.441 --> 02:29.860
Is this another one
of your tall tales, Uncle Babi?

02:30.027 --> 02:31.862
My mom says you
exaggerate sometimes.

02:32.029 --> 02:35.907
No, cheeky monkey.
This is truest of true story.

02:36.074 --> 02:38.660
It all started 40 years ago,

02:38.827 --> 02:41.538
<i>when a brave adventurer
named Thomas Howard</i>

02:41.705 --> 02:45.208
<i>came to Egypt with his best
friend and partner, Digger,</i>

02:45.375 --> 02:47.085
<i>looking for the Bronze of Bastet.</i>

02:47.252 --> 02:49.963
We've done it, Digger.
Good boy.

02:50.130 --> 02:53.091
<i>What is a Bronze of Bastet,
Uncle Babi?</i>

02:53.258 --> 02:56.011
<i>- It is the first clue</i>-

02:56.178 --> 02:58.930
<i>The lost collar of Cleopatra.</i>

03:10.275 --> 03:11.902
The other half is missing.

03:16.156 --> 03:17.657
The chest was booby-trapped.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.328
Run, boy! Run, boy, run!

03:34.800 --> 03:37.386
Leave it, Digger.
It's too dangerous. Let's go!

03:46.978 --> 03:49.064
Ah!

03:55.487 --> 03:57.614
Good boy.

03:57.781 --> 03:59.908
Phew!
That was close call.

04:00.075 --> 04:02.452
Babu happy Digger escaped from tomb.

04:02.619 --> 04:05.872
So did they ever find the other half?
And where are the Buddies?

04:06.039 --> 04:11.420
Be patient, Babu.
Great adventurer has much patience.

04:11.586 --> 04:14.506
Now hurry up and listen,
so Uncle Babi can continue story.

04:14.673 --> 04:17.466
Many years went by
and Thomas retired.

04:17.634 --> 04:20.095
He moved to a small town
called Fernfield,

04:20.262 --> 04:21.555
<i>where he opened a museum,</i>

04:21.721 --> 04:24.349
<i>had a family and
a grandson named Pete.</i>

04:24.516 --> 04:27.436
And so Digger and I made it out

04:27.602 --> 04:30.439
just as the tomb collapsed.

04:30.605 --> 04:34.526
<i>And Digger had grandpuppies, too,
who were heroic, just like him.</i>

04:34.693 --> 04:37.821
<i>Buddha, Budderball, Mudbud,</i>

04:37.988 --> 04:40.198
<i>B-Dawg and their
little sis, Rosebud.</i>

04:40.365 --> 04:42.284
<i>But don't let
the pink bow fool you,</i>

04:42.451 --> 04:44.911
<i>she is feistier
than all the boys combined.</i>

04:45.078 --> 04:49.916
And we brought this half of the
Bronze of Bastet back to Fernfield.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.085
This way, please.

04:52.252 --> 04:54.838
OK, let's move to the next room.

04:56.923 --> 04:59.217
Whoa, Digger was the coolest dude ever.

04:59.384 --> 05:02.971
Perhaps Digger's spirit lives in you.
You both love dirt.

05:03.138 --> 05:05.390
Yo, Digger was old-school cool.

05:05.557 --> 05:08.727
- I'm the new fly dog.
- I met your great grandpappy

05:08.894 --> 05:11.146
when I was knee-high to a grasshopper.

05:11.313 --> 05:14.816
I heard grasshoppers and bugs
are a delicacy in some countries.

05:14.983 --> 05:18.695
Can you imagine ever being so
hungry you have to eat bugs?

05:18.862 --> 05:20.530
Yeah, right, Budderball.

05:20.697 --> 05:23.366
You'd eat anything...
other than vegetables.

05:23.533 --> 05:27.370
As the legend goes,
Cleopatra was given a necklace,

05:27.537 --> 05:31.416
which contained the powerful
jewel of the Cat's Eye.

05:31.583 --> 05:34.419
But, somehow, it became lost.

05:34.586 --> 05:37.589
But you almost found it,
didn't you, Grandpa?

05:38.507 --> 05:40.133
I certainly tried, Peter.

05:41.510 --> 05:46.097
Well... that wraps up my last tour.

05:47.265 --> 05:49.851
Thank you.
Thank you all for being here.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.561
Have a wonderful day.

05:52.771 --> 05:54.189
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:54.356 --> 05:56.525
Wow, Grandpa, that was great.

05:56.691 --> 05:59.569
Ah, if you like it, Peter,
that's enough for me.

05:59.736 --> 06:03.156
Why does the museum have to close?
Such a bummer.

06:03.323 --> 06:06.326
Yes, Pete, it is a... bummer.

06:06.493 --> 06:07.994
And we haven't had the funding

06:08.161 --> 06:10.789
to acquire a new exhibit
in quite some time.

06:14.584 --> 06:17.128
It's really too bad you and Digger
never found the other half,

06:17.295 --> 06:19.631
and the lost necklace of Cleocatra.

06:19.798 --> 06:23.093
I just hope a young archaeologist
like you finds it,

06:23.260 --> 06:25.637
and not some greedy grave robber.

06:27.347 --> 06:30.267
How did dogs become man's
best friends if cats were first?

06:30.433 --> 06:34.813
The Cat's Eye necklace was
believed to have magical powers.

06:34.980 --> 06:38.942
Legend has it Cleocatra
had plotted to steal it.

06:39.109 --> 06:41.820
They say she wanted
to change the order,

06:41.987 --> 06:47.284
making cats rulers over all
Earth's creatures, including man.

06:47.450 --> 06:52.247
But, somehow, she was foiled
by the legendary pup, Buddasi.

06:52.414 --> 06:55.834
Cleocatra's necklace
was never seen again.

06:56.001 --> 06:58.628
All we know is the order was changed

06:58.795 --> 07:03.133
and dogs became man's best friend,
and cats were banished.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.261
I guess that's why it's in
our DNA to chase cats, dudes.

07:06.428 --> 07:08.597
When I see one,
I just can't help it.

07:11.016 --> 07:13.935
Did you see that?
The cat's eyes moved.

07:14.102 --> 07:17.063
Huh. Must be one of those
optical delusions.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.733
Oh, don't worry, B-Dawg.

07:19.899 --> 07:22.277
Those cats are just statues.

07:30.827 --> 07:33.496
Come on, cat, I'm gettin'
all up in your grill.

07:33.663 --> 07:35.957
What are you gonna do about it?

07:36.124 --> 07:37.709
Yeah, that's what I thought.

07:37.876 --> 07:41.421
You ain't nothing but
a skinny, bald, scaredy-cat.

07:41.588 --> 07:44.591
Ahh!

07:47.761 --> 07:49.721
Now, just wait a minute, Peter.

07:52.891 --> 07:56.853
Here's some stuff you might like.
Tools of the trade.

07:58.229 --> 08:01.941
- Anything you want is yours.
- Even your compass?

08:02.108 --> 08:03.985
Better a young explorer
like you have it.

08:04.152 --> 08:08.615
Oh. And here's
something for Mudbud.

08:10.408 --> 08:13.370
- It's Digger's favorite bandanna.
- Cool!

08:13.536 --> 08:16.915
Yes

08:22.128 --> 08:25.548
He's the spitting image
of his great grandpappy.

08:27.342 --> 08:30.595
Wait. Why was Grandpa Thomas
giving away all his things?

08:30.762 --> 08:32.472
Was he giving up being adventurer?

08:32.639 --> 08:36.308
Yes, but Grandpa Thomas
about to learn important lesson.

08:36.476 --> 08:39.145
Great adventurer never gives up.

08:41.815 --> 08:43.525
What are we going to do with this now?

08:43.692 --> 08:46.778
Well, I'm not sure what
we should do with it, Peter.

08:46.945 --> 08:49.364
Oh, my, I apologize.

08:49.531 --> 08:51.866
I didn't see you there,
Mister...?

08:52.033 --> 08:54.285
Wellington.
Dr. Philip Wellington.

08:54.452 --> 08:58.164
Of course.
Dr. Wellington, what an honor.

08:58.331 --> 09:01.292
May I... as you say in America,

09:01.459 --> 09:03.336
cut right to the chase, professor?

09:04.796 --> 09:10.343
I have something that
I think might... interest you.

09:14.806 --> 09:18.768
- It can't be. May I?
- Hmm.

09:23.565 --> 09:26.693
Unbelievable.
How did you find this?

09:26.860 --> 09:29.863
Well, let's just say
it took a very long time

09:30.029 --> 09:32.323
and... considerable effort.

09:33.575 --> 09:36.244
Why didn't I hear of this discovery?

09:36.411 --> 09:41.666
Well, the Egyptian government and I
thought it best to keep it on the QT

09:41.833 --> 09:44.461
- until we discover...
- Cleocatra's tomb!

09:44.627 --> 09:47.714
Precisely. I have a plane
waiting on standby.

09:47.881 --> 09:50.884
Well, I can't just
pick up and go to Egypt.

09:51.050 --> 09:56.055
Thomas, the only missing piece
of the puzzle is you.

09:56.222 --> 10:00.894
But I promised my grandson
a camping trip for spring break.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.480
Well, bring the lad along.

10:03.646 --> 10:07.233
Surely, a trip to Egypt
is more exciting.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.613
Yeah!
Mudbud can come too, right?

10:11.780 --> 10:14.699
That?
No, no, no. No dogs.

10:14.866 --> 10:15.909
Yes...

10:16.075 --> 10:20.246
I'm afraid my dear, sweet cat,
Ubasti, is allergic to them,

10:20.413 --> 10:23.666
so your Mud dog
will have to stay here.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.377
So what do you say, Thomas?
Do we have an arrangement?

10:28.338 --> 10:30.840
- I don't know.
- Oh, my dear man.

10:31.007 --> 10:34.177
You don't want to be an old relic,
like the things in this quaint,

10:34.344 --> 10:36.763
little museum,
when you could show the world

10:36.930 --> 10:40.308
what a great archeologist
Thomas Howard really is.

10:41.059 --> 10:43.728
Finding Cleocatra's necklace

10:43.895 --> 10:47.982
is one of the greatest
archeological finds in history.

10:48.149 --> 10:50.068
You've worked for this your whole life.

10:50.235 --> 10:52.570
And you know well
that opportunities like this

10:52.737 --> 10:55.490
only come round once in a lifetime.

10:59.327 --> 11:02.872
You're right.
Let's find that tomb!

11:03.039 --> 11:06.918
The town of Bastati,
that is where we must go.

11:09.212 --> 11:11.798
- You ready to go, Peter?
- Oh, I'm ready.

11:11.965 --> 11:14.008
This is gonna be epic!

11:14.175 --> 11:16.803
Take care of my baby, Dad.
Remember he's only ten.

11:16.970 --> 11:18.930
And call me when you land.

11:19.097 --> 11:20.765
And then every day, twice.

11:20.932 --> 11:24.102
- Don't you worry, sweetheart.
- Well, we mustn't dawdle.

11:24.269 --> 11:26.396
Wheels up in precisely 26 minutes.

11:26.563 --> 11:28.398
Chop-chop. Let's go.

11:31.067 --> 11:33.945
Hey, Mudbud. Bye...

11:35.154 --> 11:37.282
Ohh. Yes.

11:37.448 --> 11:39.200
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetie.

11:40.285 --> 11:42.287
- Bye, Dad.
- Be good.

11:43.872 --> 11:46.291
- Have a good time.
- Let's go, Peter.

11:49.127 --> 11:51.379
I'll bring you back some Egyptian mud.

11:51.546 --> 11:52.964
He won't be bringing you back

11:53.131 --> 11:55.800
- anything, Dirtbud.
- Huh?

11:55.967 --> 11:58.845
When we find the Cat's Eye jewel,
it'll be mine,

11:59.012 --> 12:02.807
and cats will finally rule,
with me as their queen.

12:02.974 --> 12:05.143
Not if the Buddies
have anything to say about it.

12:05.310 --> 12:09.314
Bye-bye, fleabag.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.776
Ohh. Poor Mudbud's devastated.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.655
Ohh.

12:29.292 --> 12:32.003
That cat dudette
cannot get away with this.

12:32.170 --> 12:34.339
Don't worry, Pete,
I'm coming to save you.

12:53.983 --> 12:57.195
We heard your emergency howl.

12:57.362 --> 13:00.365
Is everything OK? Or was someone
just trying to give you a bath?

13:00.531 --> 13:02.659
Pete and Grandpa Thomas
are in trouble!

13:02.825 --> 13:04.702
You know that collar
Sniffer told us about?

13:04.869 --> 13:06.913
The one that could be
the end of all dogkind?

13:07.080 --> 13:09.540
- Yeah?
- Well, that creepy cat said

13:09.707 --> 13:13.044
she was going to get the collar
and use it to rule humans and dogs.

13:13.211 --> 13:15.713
Yo, ain't no one
gonna rule the B-Dawg.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.424
Nohow, no way.
That's fo' shizzle.

13:18.591 --> 13:21.177
What are we waiting for?
Let's get on that plane.

13:22.595 --> 13:25.515
- Follow me.
- Team Buddies to the rescue.

13:45.618 --> 13:47.203
Back it up a little bit.

13:47.370 --> 13:50.665
- Yo, what's the plan now?
- We hitch a ride to Egypt

13:50.832 --> 13:53.584
and kick some serious kitty butt, dudes.

13:58.047 --> 14:00.049
So Buddies set off for Egypt,

14:00.216 --> 14:03.720
a land of amazing adventure
and shiny treasure,

14:03.886 --> 14:07.181
but most importantly, me,
Babi the Great.

14:29.579 --> 14:32.123
As-salaam alaikum, Mr. Wellington.
Very happy to see you.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.959
Seti, skip the formalities
and unload the plane.

14:35.126 --> 14:37.128
Meet us in Bastati
and gather supplies.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.301
That means "good morning."

14:43.468 --> 14:47.096
I'm Thomas Howard,
and this is my grandson, Peter.

14:47.263 --> 14:50.975
Hello. Hello, Peter.
My name is Seti.

14:51.142 --> 14:53.144
This is my cousin, Tarik.

15:03.112 --> 15:05.698
What, you crazy?
This is explosives.

15:05.865 --> 15:08.409
Put that down.
What is wrong with you?

15:08.993 --> 15:09.994
Mmm.

15:16.167 --> 15:19.045
Hey, you guys,
we must've landed in Egypt.

15:19.212 --> 15:21.089
It's raining falafel sauce!

15:58.835 --> 16:00.169
Come on, Peter.

16:02.463 --> 16:04.215
WOW!

16:04.382 --> 16:07.969
Egypt... I've missed this place.

16:08.136 --> 16:10.805
- Come on.
- You think we can explore the bazaar?

16:16.144 --> 16:18.354
Dudes, I think
we're on the road again.

16:18.521 --> 16:20.523
When do you meet the Buddies,
Uncle Babi?

16:20.690 --> 16:22.775
Soon, soon. Be patient.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.365
<i>At first, Babi met
Pete and Grandpa Thomas.</i>

16:41.711 --> 16:44.172
This place is so cool.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.424
Mudbud would've loved this.

16:46.591 --> 16:48.467
Let me show you something, Peter.

16:53.264 --> 16:58.102
- What are they?
- Dried seeds. Great for snacking.

17:10.364 --> 17:13.284
<i>Pete give Babi
his favorite compass in trade.</i>

17:17.829 --> 17:20.750
<i>Uncle Babi, what did you
trade Pete for compass?</i>

17:20.916 --> 17:25.378
<i>Did Babi say "trade"?
I mean borrow... permanently.</i>

17:28.799 --> 17:30.718
No, no, Ubasti, come back.

17:30.885 --> 17:33.137
No, no, no. Don't go
into that awful market.

17:33.304 --> 17:36.724
OK, let's go.
Slightly used camel,

17:36.891 --> 17:39.602
low mileage,
owned by little old lady.

17:39.769 --> 17:41.979
Do I hear 500 pounds?

17:42.146 --> 17:46.734
Five hundred? Sold! OK.
Let's have the money. OK.

17:46.901 --> 17:51.614
And now, Babu, Babi about to
meet bad man and hairless cat.

17:54.242 --> 17:57.703
Kitty?

17:57.870 --> 18:00.164
- Welcome.
- Oh, welcome.

18:00.331 --> 18:02.458
How very nice of you.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.710
What is this?

18:07.129 --> 18:09.465
Pure Egyptian...

18:10.925 --> 18:12.927
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

18:13.094 --> 18:16.806
There's nothing I detest more
than a petty, primate thief.

18:16.973 --> 18:21.352
Babi not steal.
I was just admiring shiny object.

18:22.770 --> 18:24.272
Beat it!

18:24.438 --> 18:28.192
Ubasti, there you are.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.535
Ooh.

18:39.370 --> 18:43.624
Guys, I think this is cheese!
I'm starving.

18:43.791 --> 18:46.085
Yuck, that cheese smells funny.

18:46.252 --> 18:47.712
This is stinky cheese.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.433
I guess stinky cheese
is an acquired taste.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.226
I'd better acquire some more.

19:08.274 --> 19:12.486
As-salaam <i>alaikum.</i>

19:12.653 --> 19:13.904
My name is Pete.

19:15.573 --> 19:16.949
Oh. Oh!

19:17.116 --> 19:18.909
You don't speak English.

19:19.076 --> 19:21.996
Um...

19:27.793 --> 19:30.212
You said that I am a cucumber.

19:32.048 --> 19:36.427
- Hey, you do speak English.
- Yes, my father taught me.

19:36.594 --> 19:40.431
My name is Farah.
You are American.

19:40.598 --> 19:45.019
Yeah. I'm here with my Grandpa.
He's a great archeologist.

19:46.103 --> 19:49.065
We're going to discover
Cleocatra's tomb.

19:50.066 --> 19:51.233
Cleopatra's tomb.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.986
No, not Cleopatra.

19:54.153 --> 19:56.322
Her cat, Cleocatra.

19:56.489 --> 19:58.032
Farah.

19:58.199 --> 20:00.826
Oh, that is my father, I must go.

20:00.993 --> 20:05.081
<i>It was very nice to meet you, Peter.
As-salaam alaikum.</i>

20:22.515 --> 20:25.976
Guys, I'm not feeling too good.

20:26.143 --> 20:28.687
Budderball, don't panic, but...

20:28.854 --> 20:32.024
I don't think that was cheese
you ate. It was explosives!

20:32.191 --> 20:34.985
Oh, no. I'm gonna explode!

20:35.152 --> 20:36.862
Don't you dare Dutch oven us!

20:38.114 --> 20:39.031
- OK.
- Seti...

20:39.198 --> 20:41.492
Box making noises.

20:42.827 --> 20:45.329
You're right, it is making noises. OK.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.836
Hey... get the crowbar.
I'll get this one.

20:54.672 --> 20:57.174
Budderball, I take it back.
Let 'er rip.

20:59.969 --> 21:01.220
- Disgusting.
- Gross.

21:03.222 --> 21:05.224
- That's not good.
- Boom, boom?

21:05.391 --> 21:08.519
Run! Run! Run!

21:08.686 --> 21:11.230
Let me outta here, yo.

21:13.983 --> 21:18.320
It's Dirtbud and his team
of dim-witted wonder dogs.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.114
How did they get here?

21:22.908 --> 21:24.160
Tarik.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.996
- Tarik!
- Huh?

21:30.040 --> 21:31.834
Where did Pete and Grandpa Thomas go?

21:32.001 --> 21:35.421
OK, we've got a lot of ground
to cover. Let's split into groups.

21:35.588 --> 21:37.756
B-Dawg, you go with Buddha,
so we can keep you out of trouble.

21:37.923 --> 21:40.843
Budderball, you stick with
Mudbud, and I'll go by myself.

21:41.010 --> 21:42.928
I know how you boys
hate shopping anyways.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.598
All right, dudes,
let's go track them down.

21:54.565 --> 21:58.402
Not bad. I could lay down
some sick beats to this.

22:03.032 --> 22:05.576
- Snake!
- Don't worry, B-Dawg.

22:05.743 --> 22:09.663
The snake is in a trance.
He's meditating to the music.

22:14.418 --> 22:16.879
Wow, look at these colors.

22:21.342 --> 22:22.801
Let me give you something.

22:28.057 --> 22:29.308
Aww

22:29.475 --> 22:32.269
OMG. This is so to die for.

22:32.436 --> 22:36.774
OK, next up we have beautiful animal.

22:36.941 --> 22:40.319
Very young,
but will grow big and strong.

22:40.486 --> 22:42.905
Five hundred!
Five hundred pounds!

22:43.239 --> 22:48.327
Kebab! Hot kebab!
Come get your chicken kebab!

22:48.494 --> 22:51.163
Oh, sweet mama, kebabs!

22:51.330 --> 22:53.415
We're on a mission here, Budderball.

22:53.582 --> 22:55.960
But I search much better
on a full stomach.

22:56.126 --> 23:00.464
Besides, the best way to know a new
culture is to sample its cuisine.

23:06.095 --> 23:09.139
OK, one kebab for you. Eat it.

23:10.307 --> 23:13.018
Hey, come back here!

23:13.185 --> 23:14.937
Stop that thief!

23:15.104 --> 23:16.689
Yo, dawg, did you hear that?

23:16.855 --> 23:18.399
It sounds like Budderball's in trouble.

23:18.566 --> 23:20.818
It came from over there.
Come on, B-Dawg.

23:20.985 --> 23:22.736
<i>Uncle Babi, wait a second.</i>

23:22.903 --> 23:26.407
That's how you met the Buddies?
You stole Budderball's kebab?

23:26.574 --> 23:31.412
You snooze, you lose. And Babi,
winner-winner kebab dinner.

23:31.579 --> 23:33.747
Anyways, Babi helping Budderball out.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.000
<i>Chicken bone choking
hazard for dogs.</i>

23:36.166 --> 23:38.127
Stop!

23:38.294 --> 23:40.504
Somebody stop that kebab-a-robber!

23:40.671 --> 23:42.464
Boys.

23:51.307 --> 23:53.642
Got you cornered, you chicken thief.

23:53.809 --> 23:56.270
Budderball, stop monkeying around.

23:56.437 --> 23:59.648
I'm not monkeying around,
he's monkeying around.

24:00.357 --> 24:03.569
Please, don't hurt Babi.
Babi am but a humble monkey.

24:03.736 --> 24:06.447
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

24:06.614 --> 24:09.575
- This monkey is a no-good crook.
- Here.

24:13.746 --> 24:16.123
See, now I give you something in trade.

24:16.290 --> 24:19.627
- I'm not much of a hat dog.
- Ooh. Looks good on you.

24:19.793 --> 24:24.465
- OK, we'll call it even-steven.
- I am Babi, not Steven.

24:24.632 --> 24:28.260
I'm Budderball and these
are my brothers, Mudbud, Buddha,

24:28.427 --> 24:31.055
and B-Dawg, and our little sis, Rosebud.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.265
It is pleasure to meet you all.

24:33.432 --> 24:37.186
- What brings you to Egypt?
- Actually, we're looking for my people.

24:37.353 --> 24:39.021
My boy, Peter, and his grandpa.

24:39.188 --> 24:42.650
They were last seen with a bad man
and a creepy cat with no fur.

24:42.816 --> 24:47.279
Oh! I think I saw that cat today.
Babi does not like cats.

24:47.446 --> 24:48.530
You've seen her?

24:49.907 --> 24:52.117
Hey, that's Pete's compass, dude!

24:52.284 --> 24:55.079
Babi see it fall
out of boy's pocket.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.331
Finders keeper, losers weeper.

24:57.498 --> 24:59.124
So you've seen Pete, too?

24:59.291 --> 25:01.460
That compass is
very important to him.

25:01.627 --> 25:05.255
Babi could give you compass...
perhaps in trade?

25:06.340 --> 25:08.634
Babi likes shiny objects.

25:08.801 --> 25:11.804
My bling?
You've gots to be trippin'.

25:11.970 --> 25:15.057
Babi will give you compass
and help you with everything.

25:15.224 --> 25:16.725
Promise to get you to boy.

25:16.892 --> 25:20.729
"B" for Babi look very nice
on Babi's hairy chest.

25:20.896 --> 25:23.107
Sorry, dawg, you can't have it.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.943
B-Dawg, he knows where
Pete and Grandpa Thomas are.

25:26.110 --> 25:28.737
We need his help.
Give him anything he wants.

25:33.617 --> 25:36.662
- What's that, dudes?
- It's the Muslim call to prayer.

25:36.829 --> 25:40.124
It is getting late.
Market not safe at night.

25:40.290 --> 25:43.877
Babi know place where you can sleep.
I will show you boy in the morning.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.338
Follow me, friends.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.632
This is so not happening.

25:48.799 --> 25:51.135
I'm practically naked without my bling.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.352
This way, Buddies.

26:07.317 --> 26:09.153
Yo, what's that, dawg?

26:09.319 --> 26:13.907
It appears to be a sarcophagus, B-Dawg.
Where they put mummies in ancient Egypt.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.243
Mummies?!

26:16.410 --> 26:20.414
- Relax, they don't really come to life.
- I knew that, dawg.

26:22.958 --> 26:25.377
Quick, hide. Someone is coming.

26:34.720 --> 26:38.515
OK... OK, now tomorrow you must sell,

26:38.682 --> 26:42.811
or...
OK? OK. Bye-bye.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.869
Hey, what's wrong, little camel?

26:59.036 --> 27:01.789
That mean human
stole me from my mother,

27:01.955 --> 27:03.791
and he's trying to sell me.

27:03.957 --> 27:06.877
You were taken from your mother?
That's awful.

27:07.044 --> 27:11.340
I must find her. My tribe
is on their way into the desert.

27:11.507 --> 27:15.469
If I don't catch up with them soon,
I might never see her again.

27:15.636 --> 27:18.138
- Tribe?
- It is my family.

27:18.305 --> 27:21.558
I belong with the Bedouin tribe.
We are travelers.

27:21.725 --> 27:25.687
I get it. Kinda like my posse.
The name's B-Dawg.

27:25.854 --> 27:29.149
- My name is Cammy.
- I'm Rosebud and these are my brothers.

27:29.316 --> 27:30.442
Maybe we can help.

27:30.609 --> 27:33.779
Mummy! Ahh!

27:35.948 --> 27:38.283
- Babi!
- Is coast clear?

27:38.450 --> 27:40.452
Babi, this is Cammy.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.998
As-salaam alaikum, little camel.

27:48.585 --> 27:51.880
Dudes, I hate to be a bummer,
but the door is locked.

27:52.047 --> 27:53.215
We're stuck in here.

27:53.382 --> 27:55.467
Babi going to solve
everyone's troubles.

27:55.634 --> 27:59.263
You all sleep now.
Babi will go see what he can find out.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.947
"it will lead you
to the water's path."

28:17.114 --> 28:18.782
Perhaps someone misinformed you.

28:18.949 --> 28:20.951
We're in the desert, there's no water.

28:21.118 --> 28:23.287
- We're here.
- Ah!

28:23.453 --> 28:28.083
"From the eye of the needle,
take direction from Thoth."

28:28.250 --> 28:30.335
What do you think it means, Grandpa?

28:30.502 --> 28:32.921
Thoth, the moon god,
take direction from the moon.

28:33.088 --> 28:36.091
- The moon.
- "From the eye of the needle,

28:36.258 --> 28:39.803
take direction from the moon.

28:39.970 --> 28:44.016
On the 12th day,
the moon will light the way."

28:44.182 --> 28:47.311
- There's a full moon tonight.
- That looks like a needle,

28:47.477 --> 28:50.314
and there's a half-moon
carved in the top.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.985
The obelisk! Peter, let's go!

28:59.448 --> 29:00.741
Ahh.

29:08.665 --> 29:12.127
- Oh, my. Dr. Wellington.
- Yes, yes, of course.

29:36.068 --> 29:37.653
Incredible.

29:51.458 --> 29:54.044
- What now?
- Well, now...

29:54.211 --> 29:56.922
we need to calibrate
the position of the beam

29:57.089 --> 29:59.007
and coordinate it on the map.

30:02.761 --> 30:05.931
Ah, given the height
of the tower...

30:06.890 --> 30:08.767
60 feet,

30:08.934 --> 30:14.356
the light should be going
south by southeast, 86 miles.

30:14.523 --> 30:18.443
And leading us... to this oasis.

30:18.610 --> 30:22.823
Ah! They're heading to the oasis.
I must tell the Buddies.

30:56.023 --> 30:58.066
- Buddies!
- What's up?

30:58.233 --> 30:59.943
Your people are leaving in the morning.

31:00.110 --> 31:02.946
They're on their way to oasis,
deep in desert.

31:03.113 --> 31:06.074
Oasis? I've been there
with my tribe before.

31:06.241 --> 31:08.368
That could be where they're headed, too.

31:08.535 --> 31:09.911
I can show you the way.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.872
And we can help you find your tribe.

31:12.039 --> 31:14.207
Babi will hitch ride and slow them down.

31:26.428 --> 31:27.971
Ohh.

31:28.138 --> 31:31.266
- What are you thinking?
- How rad this is.

31:31.433 --> 31:34.728
Mudbud would've loved it.

31:34.895 --> 31:38.815
Knowing Mudbud, he's probably
off on an adventure of his own.

31:38.982 --> 31:43.028
You know, for some reason,
Mudbud doesn't feel that far away.

32:02.172 --> 32:04.549
Ahh! Bad man's truck.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.559
Got it.

32:17.187 --> 32:18.855
Upsy-daisy.

32:23.944 --> 32:26.696
Chop-chop, my good man.
We're seven minutes behind schedule.

32:30.826 --> 32:34.621
I know that whistle.
The man is coming to take me away.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.665
Not if we have anything to do with it.

32:36.832 --> 32:39.417
I've an idea, Cammy.
You up for it?

32:39.584 --> 32:42.045
Anything to get back to my mom.

32:57.644 --> 33:02.482
- Wow, gnarly loogey, dudette!
- Come on, Buddies, let's go!

33:03.316 --> 33:05.277
Oh!

33:06.319 --> 33:09.072
My beautiful camel! Oh!

33:13.160 --> 33:14.161
Oh!

33:16.496 --> 33:20.083
<i>Now, the Buddies and
their newfound camel friend escape,</i>

33:20.250 --> 33:21.960
<i>and follow Babi into the desert.</i>

33:22.127 --> 33:23.420
<i>Where were you, Uncle Babi?</i>

33:23.587 --> 33:26.173
<i>Babi hitch
a ride on top of truck.</i>

33:26.339 --> 33:29.092
Babi <i>sneaky</i> monkey.

33:29.259 --> 33:31.469
Who are they, Grandpa?

33:31.636 --> 33:33.138
They're Bedouins, Pete.

33:33.305 --> 33:36.016
They're a nomadic people of the desert.

33:44.566 --> 33:49.112
Hey, you, move your disgusting
beasts. I'm in a hurry.

33:49.279 --> 33:50.989
You should be very careful.

33:51.156 --> 33:53.783
This area is known
for bandits and thieves.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.828
Safe travels.

34:21.061 --> 34:23.688
Come on, guys. We just
have to make it to the oasis.

34:23.855 --> 34:27.442
I'm running on fumes.
Cammy, aren't you hungry?

34:27.609 --> 34:30.402
We camels were born
to survive in the heat,

34:30.570 --> 34:33.114
and go a long time
without food and water.

34:33.281 --> 34:36.659
We can regurgitate the food
in our stomach and re-chew it,

34:36.826 --> 34:38.954
so we can go longer
without a meal.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.873
- Eww. TMI, Cammy
- Good idea.

34:47.837 --> 34:52.092
- Budderball... gross.
- Mmm. I love leftovers.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.144
What happened? What you do?

35:03.311 --> 35:06.147
I told you, check out the truck
before we left.

35:06.314 --> 35:08.400
- But I did.
- You did? Oh.

35:08.566 --> 35:10.652
I swear, your brain
is the size of a monkey's.

35:13.196 --> 35:14.572
For heaven's sakes,
what's wrong with it?

35:14.739 --> 35:17.867
Is broken.

35:18.034 --> 35:20.495
I don't suppose you know
anything about motorized vehicles?

35:20.662 --> 35:22.580
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

35:25.417 --> 35:29.129
Well, let's see what the problem is.
Oh, my goodness.

35:31.214 --> 35:33.091
Hose came loose.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.636
Just put some coolant in it.

35:47.355 --> 35:49.399
Look,
there's the oasis just up ahead.

35:50.567 --> 35:53.153
How did all this grow
in the middle of the desert?

35:53.320 --> 35:55.655
Even though
we're in the driest of places,

35:55.822 --> 36:00.327
centuries ago, in Cleopatra's time,
there was a river here.

36:00.493 --> 36:03.455
And that river is still
running deep underground.

36:03.621 --> 36:06.833
We'll set up camp,
look for the next clue at daybreak.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.209
All right.

36:11.796 --> 36:16.885
- Are we close, Cammy?
- I... I am not sure, Rosebud.

36:17.052 --> 36:18.762
I think so.

36:18.928 --> 36:22.891
Aw, snap. We're doomed. Doomed!

36:23.058 --> 36:26.728
- Think positively, B-Dawg.
- I am positive.

36:26.895 --> 36:30.023
Positively sure we're lost
in the middle of the desert.

36:30.190 --> 36:33.610
Do not worry, Buddies,
my tribe has been here.

36:33.777 --> 36:36.446
There's some camel poop
on the ground right there.

36:41.910 --> 36:43.578
That's camel poop all right.

36:43.745 --> 36:46.873
We're gonna need a bulldozer
to clean up that mess,

36:47.040 --> 36:50.043
'cause a peeper scooper
definitely's not doing it.

36:50.210 --> 36:53.088
It's getting too dark
to follow their trail.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.423
The dudette is correctomundo.

36:55.590 --> 36:58.426
We'll rest here for the night,
and get our groove back tomorrow.

37:01.638 --> 37:05.558
So, young Peter, what story
would you like to hear this time?

37:05.725 --> 37:08.353
Can you tell me the story
about the Cat's Eye necklace?

37:08.520 --> 37:09.687
All right.

37:09.854 --> 37:13.650
The cat goddess, Bastet,
gave a special necklace

37:13.817 --> 37:18.238
<i>with a Cat's Eye jewel to Cleopatra,
the ruler of Egypt.</i>

37:18.405 --> 37:21.366
<i>Cleopatra's favorite feline,
Cleopatra,</i>

37:21.533 --> 37:25.829
<i>was furious that Bastet
gave the necklace to a human.</i>

37:25.995 --> 37:28.456
<i>She decided to steal the necklace.</i>

37:28.623 --> 37:32.502
<i>But a vigilant puppy, Buddasi,
saw Cleopatra.</i>

37:39.676 --> 37:42.053
<i>And Cleopatra was so mad</i>

37:42.220 --> 37:45.014
<i>over being betrayed
by her trusted cat,</i>

37:45.181 --> 37:49.102
<i>that she used the necklace
to make dogs man's best friend.</i>

37:49.269 --> 37:51.980
<i>And cats were banished
from the palace.</i>

37:57.652 --> 38:00.655
Grandpa, is it gonna rain?

38:00.822 --> 38:05.618
No, no. That's just dry lightning
from an electrical storm.

38:05.785 --> 38:08.204
Happens all the time
out here in the desert.

38:10.290 --> 38:11.749
Ah, looks far enough away.

38:11.916 --> 38:14.544
I'm sure we're perfectly safe.

38:15.879 --> 38:20.049
Time to hit the rack, though.
We have an early day tomorrow.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.302
You get a good sleep.

38:22.469 --> 38:24.762
I'm gonna go stretch
these old legs of mine.

38:24.929 --> 38:28.183
Grandpa, thank you for
bringing me on this adventure.

38:28.349 --> 38:32.812
It's my pleasure, Peter.

38:32.979 --> 38:35.940
I couldn't ask for a better partner.

38:41.321 --> 38:43.281
Mudbud, are you OK?

38:43.448 --> 38:46.618
Yeah, I'm just sorry
I got us into this.

38:46.784 --> 38:48.453
I'm really worried about Pete.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.247
Fate set us on this path, Mudbud.

38:51.414 --> 38:53.291
Every journey has a deeper reason.

38:53.458 --> 38:56.753
Good night, Buddies,
you're the best of friends.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.630
Sweet dreams, everybody.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.686
Wake up, Buddies. It's morning.

39:13.853 --> 39:16.773
Let's rock and roll. Who knows
how far ahead of us they are.

39:28.868 --> 39:31.496
Hey, Grandpa,
I'm gonna go explore.

39:31.663 --> 39:36.626
- Have you seen my compass?
- No. No, I haven't, Peter.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.920
Well, you go ahead.
I'll join you in a minute.

39:44.133 --> 39:46.553
- Ah!
- You got me.

39:47.554 --> 39:49.973
- Hello, Farah.
- Hello, Peter.

39:50.139 --> 39:52.934
- When did you get here?
- Late last night.

39:53.101 --> 39:55.853
Sometimes we travel at night
when it is cooler.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.522
Where are you going?

39:57.689 --> 40:00.191
Our tribe is making
its way through the desert.

40:00.358 --> 40:02.151
It is our way, nothing more.

40:02.318 --> 40:04.696
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to be nosy.

40:04.862 --> 40:07.699
My daughter says you are here
with your grandfather.

40:07.865 --> 40:10.451
This man you are traveling with...

40:10.618 --> 40:12.620
does your grandfather know him well?

40:12.787 --> 40:14.414
He just met him a few days ago.

40:14.581 --> 40:16.332
You would do well not to trust him.

40:18.126 --> 40:21.421
Be safe. The desert can be
a very unforgiving place.

40:23.214 --> 40:25.883
- See you later, Farah.
- Bye.

40:26.050 --> 40:27.468
Ah, Peter.

40:29.012 --> 40:31.723
- I see you've made a friend.
- That man said not to trust...

40:31.889 --> 40:35.101
All right, chaps,
no time for chattering.

40:35.268 --> 40:38.980
- Time to find the next clue.
- Well...

40:41.524 --> 40:45.445
- This well was built centuries ago.
- Mmm.

40:45.612 --> 40:47.905
This was the widest
part of the river.

40:48.072 --> 40:52.327
And the Egyptians would
have built an access

40:52.493 --> 40:54.203
to the river running down below.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.125
- Are you OK, Grandpa?
- Yes!

41:01.294 --> 41:02.837
Ohh!

41:04.547 --> 41:05.965
Jackpot!

41:07.300 --> 41:09.510
What? What have you found?

41:09.677 --> 41:11.846
It's the Cat's Eye symbol.

41:12.013 --> 41:14.015
This must be the entrance.

41:21.522 --> 41:24.108
Careful now. Careful.

41:25.568 --> 41:28.905
Here we go.
All right. I got this.

41:30.239 --> 41:31.824
Easy does it.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.576
Slow, slow.

41:35.078 --> 41:36.454
Hold it.

41:37.038 --> 41:38.206
Ooh!

41:46.881 --> 41:48.091
Careful.

41:48.966 --> 41:50.760
Whoa!

41:50.927 --> 41:52.720
Uh-huh...

41:52.887 --> 41:56.724
Look how much
light is coming in here. Ah!

41:56.891 --> 42:00.937
The sun must be directly
over the opening of the well.

42:01.104 --> 42:05.566
Oh.

42:21.249 --> 42:23.084
Oh. Peter.

42:24.502 --> 42:26.587
Go clean off that part
of the wall over there.

42:26.754 --> 42:30.007
And, Seti, clean that other spot.

42:33.761 --> 42:35.304
Hurry along, hurry along.

42:43.312 --> 42:44.480
Well, what does it mean?

42:44.647 --> 42:48.901
That one stands for royalty
in this part of Egypt.

42:49.068 --> 42:51.487
And the other is called a menet.

42:51.654 --> 42:55.074
It's the source
of great power for the gods.

42:55.241 --> 42:56.200
Tarik, the map!

42:59.620 --> 43:01.664
Thank you.

43:01.831 --> 43:04.417
- Yes, I know, Ubasti.
- Ahh...

43:07.170 --> 43:08.212
I think we have it.

43:10.465 --> 43:13.217
I know where Cleocatra's tomb lies.

43:20.725 --> 43:23.186
I don't know how much
farther I can go.

43:23.352 --> 43:27.273
- We need water.
- We can't stop, dudes.

43:32.361 --> 43:33.946
This way, Babu.

43:38.242 --> 43:41.496
Babi had brilliant plan
to slow down bad man.

43:41.662 --> 43:43.164
What did you do, Uncle Babi?

43:43.331 --> 43:46.209
Hold your camels, Babu.
You will see.

43:47.001 --> 43:49.378
Ahh!

44:07.355 --> 44:10.274
Yes, Ubasti,
we're getting very, very close.

44:12.235 --> 44:15.029
What's that petty primate doing here?

44:15.196 --> 44:16.989
Up to no good.

44:17.156 --> 44:19.033
<i>But just when Babi
was almost complete,</i>

44:19.200 --> 44:22.119
<i>hairless cat caught
Babi monkey-handed.</i>

44:22.286 --> 44:23.621
No, no, no, no.
Oh... Uh...

44:23.788 --> 44:26.123
- Oh, no!
- Never fear, Babu.

44:26.290 --> 44:31.921
Babi scared cat with big muscles.

44:34.298 --> 44:36.634
<i>'</i> - Ah! Scary cat!

44:36.801 --> 44:38.970
What do you think you're doing?

44:39.136 --> 44:41.722
Nothing.

44:41.889 --> 44:44.767
I've traveled far
to find Cleocatra's tomb,

44:44.934 --> 44:47.103
and no one is going to stop me.

44:52.275 --> 44:54.318
Ubasti. Kitty.

44:54.485 --> 44:57.697
There you are, my little darling.

45:17.758 --> 45:20.595
Hey! What's that?

45:24.348 --> 45:25.933
What is it, Budderball?

45:26.100 --> 45:30.521
Can't you see it? Food!
Hot dogs! Pizza!

45:30.688 --> 45:33.983
And lemonade!
They've even got ice cream!

45:34.150 --> 45:35.943
Oh, sweet mama!

45:45.912 --> 45:49.999
Dudes, I think Budderball
has lost his marbles.

45:50.166 --> 45:52.418
Budderball is seeing the mirage.

45:52.585 --> 45:55.546
The heat makes your brain
do funny things sometimes.

45:55.713 --> 45:57.256
Come 0", guys, dig in!

45:57.423 --> 45:59.592
Budderball, you gotta snap out of it!

46:05.598 --> 46:08.142
Now that's what I call a sand-which!

46:08.309 --> 46:09.977
Where'd the buffet go?!

46:12.939 --> 46:16.275
Look! What's that?!
It looks like trees!

46:16.442 --> 46:20.071
Trees? You've gotta be
hallucin-a-trippin', dawg.

46:23.074 --> 46:25.368
I can still see them, it's real!

46:25.534 --> 46:28.162
And where there's trees,
there must be water.

46:28.329 --> 46:32.041
- It's the oasis!
- We're saved, dudes!

46:55.147 --> 46:57.108
Yo, dawgs, check it out.

47:14.083 --> 47:17.253
I've never been so happy
to take a bath in my whole life!

47:17.420 --> 47:19.964
- Surf's up, dudes!
- Yippee!

47:20.131 --> 47:21.424
All right!

47:24.552 --> 47:27.805
There's no way I'm going in there
without my floaties, dawgs.

47:28.764 --> 47:30.975
What now?

47:31.142 --> 47:32.893
Mr. Wellington,
I think we have a flat tire.

47:36.272 --> 47:38.607
My tribe and your tribe are not here.

47:38.774 --> 47:40.609
They must've traveled on already.

47:41.652 --> 47:43.904
What the...? What was that?

47:44.071 --> 47:47.241
Relax, B-Dawg.
It was probably just the wind.

47:47.783 --> 47:48.784
Ouch!

47:48.951 --> 47:52.580
Then that wind has sick
paw-eye coordination.

47:54.707 --> 47:57.001
Hey, they're falling
from that tree up there.

47:57.168 --> 47:59.086
Those are dates, Rosebud.

48:06.260 --> 48:09.472
Babi?

48:13.434 --> 48:16.854
Babi, we're so glad we found you!

48:17.021 --> 48:20.900
Buddies and my camel friend,
I am so glad you have made it.

48:21.067 --> 48:24.070
Babi, what happened
to Pete and Grandpa Thomas?

48:24.236 --> 48:27.740
Babi was following boy
and men and cat.

48:27.907 --> 48:32.536
Cat very scary. She find Babi,
so Babi run and hide in oasis.

48:32.703 --> 48:35.998
- Are they OK?
- Very much so, friend Mudbud.

48:36.165 --> 48:38.501
They are on their way
to Cleocatra's tomb.

48:38.667 --> 48:42.505
That's great, dawg. Too bad
we have no idea where it is.

48:42.671 --> 48:44.173
Babi has idea.

48:44.340 --> 48:47.551
Babi see Bedouin tribe following,
they can help.

48:47.718 --> 48:51.097
My mom! Come on, Buddies,
we'll go to the camp.

48:51.263 --> 48:53.224
What about the others?
We can't let them

48:53.390 --> 48:56.519
- get to the tomb before us.
- Babi has dealt with that.

49:00.189 --> 49:03.901
If we hurry, we can reach
the Bedouin tribe before nightfall.

49:07.321 --> 49:10.366
This is outrageous!
How did this happen?

49:13.369 --> 49:16.497
This is... This is all
your fault, nitwits! Idiots!

49:16.664 --> 49:19.625
Well, I guess we're going to
be stuck here for the night.

49:19.792 --> 49:23.546
So we may as well make ourselves useful,
Pete, and unload the truck.

49:30.427 --> 49:34.723
So, Babi, dawg, how 'bout
you give me back my bling?

49:34.890 --> 49:37.601
Deal is deal, friend.
All trades are final.

49:37.768 --> 49:40.563
I can't wait until
you meet my family, Buddies.

49:40.729 --> 49:43.607
They will be very grateful
for all you have done.

49:47.444 --> 49:51.115
That's it!
Many thanks to you, Buddies.

49:51.282 --> 49:54.201
And you too, Babi. I'm home!

49:59.957 --> 50:02.626
<i>'</i> Mom!

50:02.793 --> 50:07.214
Oh! I can't believe it's you.

50:10.426 --> 50:11.927
Cammy!

50:18.100 --> 50:21.562
My dear Cammy, I thought
I would never see you again.

50:21.729 --> 50:23.814
The bad man tried to sell me,

50:23.981 --> 50:27.651
but my new friends, Babi and
the Buddies, helped me escape.

50:27.818 --> 50:31.155
Oh, thank you so much
for bringing my baby back to me.

50:31.322 --> 50:33.157
How could I ever repay you?

50:33.324 --> 50:36.368
We could do lunch sometime,
soon preferably.

50:36.535 --> 50:39.580
We welcomed the opportunity
to create good karma.

50:39.747 --> 50:40.956
Namaste.

50:41.123 --> 50:45.211
Yo, B-Dawg's the name,
and these dawgs are my tribe.

50:45.377 --> 50:48.214
My name is Mala,
and my tribe would be thrilled

50:48.380 --> 50:50.382
to have you as our honored guests.

51:04.230 --> 51:07.358
Yo, these dawgs got it going on.

51:13.864 --> 51:16.283
Hmm. That looks like
an interesting game.

51:17.993 --> 51:20.788
Here you go, Buddies,
dinner is served.

51:20.955 --> 51:22.414
My three favorite words.

51:22.581 --> 51:25.918
Pinch me, I wanna make sure
this isn't a mirage.

51:28.003 --> 51:30.089
Cammy, no offense,

51:30.256 --> 51:32.967
but my dinner looks
an awful lot like bugs.

51:33.133 --> 51:37.263
- Dude, your dinner is bugs.
- Those are scarab beetles.

51:37.429 --> 51:39.598
They are a delicacy of the Bedouins.

51:39.765 --> 51:43.894
Do you have anything less delicate,
like pizza or maybe some hamburgers?

51:44.061 --> 51:46.397
Whoa! Budderball turning down food?

51:46.563 --> 51:48.482
That just blew my mind

51:48.649 --> 51:51.944
They are quite good, Budderball.
I promise.

51:52.111 --> 51:54.488
OK, here goes nothing.

51:54.655 --> 51:56.156
Over the teeth, past the gums,

51:56.323 --> 51:58.284
look out stomach,
here the bugs come.

52:03.664 --> 52:05.165
Budderball like scarabs?

52:05.332 --> 52:08.627
Crunchy, but not bad.
Tastes like chicken.

52:20.931 --> 52:23.017
Ahh.

52:23.183 --> 52:25.978
That archeologist
is getting far too nosy.

52:26.145 --> 52:30.983
Typical American.
Can't mind his Ps and Qs.

52:31.150 --> 52:33.902
But tomorrow, we'll be rid
of the wretched man

52:34.069 --> 52:37.865
and his annoying grandson,
and the treasure will be mine.

52:39.283 --> 52:40.534
Ours.

52:42.077 --> 52:43.329
Thank you. Thank you.

52:44.997 --> 52:46.165
- Hmm?
- Huh?

52:46.332 --> 52:47.458
Oh, no.

52:51.962 --> 52:53.672
Grandpa!
Grandpa, wake up!

52:55.049 --> 52:57.801
I heard Mr. Wellington
say he's gonna get rid of us

52:57.968 --> 53:00.596
- and keep the treasure for himself!
- What?!

53:01.472 --> 53:03.640
Peter, really?

53:05.642 --> 53:10.105
Oh, no. I should've known
he was just a grave robber.

53:10.272 --> 53:13.484
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, first off,

53:13.650 --> 53:17.696
we need to be very careful.
Philip could be dangerous.

53:19.239 --> 53:21.700
Could he, now?

53:21.867 --> 53:23.327
I'm done helping you, Philip.

53:23.494 --> 53:25.537
Oh, I think not, Professor Howard.

53:25.704 --> 53:27.122
For the sake of your
precious grandson,

53:27.289 --> 53:29.958
you'll do exactly
what I want you to do.

53:41.845 --> 53:43.138
What are they doing?

53:43.305 --> 53:47.059
They are sending balloon up in
sky to look for bad man and cat.

53:47.226 --> 53:50.354
Babi believe this is the way
we find your people.

53:50.521 --> 53:52.648
Travel by air is much, much faster.

53:52.815 --> 53:54.775
Let me get this straight,
monkey dude,

53:54.942 --> 53:56.777
you want us to fly up
in that balloon?

53:56.944 --> 54:00.072
Babi, do you know
how to fly that thing?

54:00.239 --> 54:03.367
Babi is good pilot. The best.

54:07.830 --> 54:10.040
Wind is going in the right direction.

54:16.922 --> 54:18.173
Quick, Buddies, come!

54:38.318 --> 54:41.196
Buddies, I can never
thank you enough.

54:41.864 --> 54:45.159
Bye, Buddies! Be safe!

54:45.325 --> 54:48.328
Bye, Cammy. Bye, Mala!
I hope we see you again.

54:48.495 --> 54:50.289
Good luck, Buddies!

55:18.066 --> 55:20.777
Look! It's the bad dude's Jeep.

55:20.944 --> 55:23.030
We would've never found them on foot.

55:23.197 --> 55:26.450
They must've gone in the truck.
Follow the tire tracks.

55:26.617 --> 55:29.495
Babi does not control wind.
Allah does.

55:38.921 --> 55:41.840
I think this is it, Peter.

55:47.721 --> 55:50.974
So... Hmm? Where is it?

55:51.767 --> 55:55.187
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

55:55.354 --> 55:59.316
- I can feel the energy.
- The energy?

56:01.902 --> 56:06.490
You worthless twit.
You've led us nowhere!

56:06.657 --> 56:09.117
Grandpa, look! A balloon!

56:09.952 --> 56:13.872
Oh...
Oh, don't be silly, Peter.

56:14.039 --> 56:17.292
There are no baboons in the desert.

56:17.459 --> 56:20.671
I think maybe you've
been out in the sun too long.

56:20.837 --> 56:22.172
You should drink some water.

56:27.803 --> 56:30.639
Dudes, there they are!
Let's land this puppy!

56:30.806 --> 56:33.183
- Land?
- Babi, please tell me

56:33.350 --> 56:34.685
you know how to land this thing.

56:34.851 --> 56:37.938
This part Babi is
not so familiar with.

56:38.105 --> 56:41.233
Oh, great. We're just gonna
float away forever.

56:41.400 --> 56:44.444
Don't worry, B-Dawg,
panic is a wasted emotion.

56:44.611 --> 56:47.489
Babi know what make
balloon go down. Hold on.

57:03.255 --> 57:04.298
Oh, no.

57:05.716 --> 57:08.135
Forget about what I said before.
Time to panic.

57:09.761 --> 57:13.473
- Oh, no!
- Hold on, Buddies.

57:13.640 --> 57:15.601
Going in for crash landing.

57:28.655 --> 57:30.198
Oh.

57:30.365 --> 57:33.869
- Babi is dizzy.
- You can say that again, dawg.

57:34.036 --> 57:36.872
Oh. Babi is dizzy.

57:44.171 --> 57:47.674
It feels like there's
a sandstorm coming on.

57:47.841 --> 57:50.552
No, nonsense.
Just a little breeze.

57:50.719 --> 57:54.264
You two. Go to the top of that
dune and have a look around.

58:01.104 --> 58:02.689
It is a sandstorm.

58:02.856 --> 58:05.192
Huh?

58:19.206 --> 58:20.540
Run for the truck, Peter!

58:24.920 --> 58:27.756
Quickly, Buddies, we can
take shelter in that cave.

58:38.475 --> 58:41.061
Be safe, Mr. Wellington!
Run, Mr. Wellington!

59:03.375 --> 59:05.377
This is most fortunate, my friends.

59:05.544 --> 59:08.130
We shall be safe here
until the storm passes.

59:20.267 --> 59:25.105
Dawgs!
This is really freaking me out.

59:26.898 --> 59:29.443
I believe this is
some sort of secret entrance

59:29.609 --> 59:32.320
used by those who built
Cleocatra's tomb.

59:32.487 --> 59:36.032
But this secret entrance
is protected by a large serpent.

59:36.199 --> 59:37.993
Serpent? What's that?

59:38.160 --> 59:40.996
It is a snake.
Babi no like snakes.

59:41.163 --> 59:45.000
Ah! For once can't
something be easy-peasy?

59:45.167 --> 59:49.421
Why can't it be protected by a
bunny rabbit or something vegetarian?

59:52.549 --> 59:57.596
Uh, dudes, long, creepy,
slimy thing at 12 o'clock.

59:57.763 --> 01:00:00.974
Hold it, hold it! Uncle B,
there's a snake coming?

01:00:01.141 --> 01:00:02.893
Is this the part
where you save the Buddies?

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:07.105
Yes, big and slimy snake, but no fear.

01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:08.982
No challenge too great for Babi.

01:00:09.149 --> 01:00:11.026
Babi about to outwit snake.

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:13.403
I promise.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:14.780
I am afraid where you go,

01:00:14.946 --> 01:00:18.533
I cannot follow, Buddies.

01:00:20.994 --> 01:00:23.455
Wait a second, wait a second.
You ran away?

01:00:23.622 --> 01:00:28.043
Uh... Yes, Babi ran to see
if he could find help.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.212
Babi is wise.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.470
Uh... Buddha, what are you doin', dawg?

01:00:38.637 --> 01:00:41.890
Calm yourself, B-Dawg.

01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:49.606
I am Slither, the serpent
protector of Cleocatra's tomb.

01:00:49.773 --> 01:00:53.026
We were hoping to secure your
permission to enter the tomb.

01:00:53.193 --> 01:00:54.945
I was put here
to protect the tomb

01:00:55.111 --> 01:00:58.657
from all those who would
seek its riches without wisdom.

01:00:58.824 --> 01:01:02.619
Only the descendants
of Buddasi may pass.

01:01:02.786 --> 01:01:05.455
You must look me in the eyes.

01:01:05.622 --> 01:01:09.543
If I can hypnotize you,
then your intentions are not pure,

01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:12.462
and you will become my supper.

01:01:12.629 --> 01:01:15.715
That's the worst dinner invite
I've ever heard.

01:01:15.882 --> 01:01:17.968
And if I win and hypnotize you?

01:01:18.134 --> 01:01:20.929
Then you are descendants of Buddasi,

01:01:21.096 --> 01:01:25.225
guardian of man,
and I will let you pass.

01:01:25.392 --> 01:01:27.853
B-Dawg, remember the snake
at the bazaar?

01:01:28.019 --> 01:01:30.355
- Uh-huh.
- Lay down some beats.

01:01:30.522 --> 01:01:32.440
I think I gotcha, dawg.

01:01:32.607 --> 01:01:35.068
I accept your challenge.

01:01:40.115 --> 01:01:43.994
Shanti. Shanti.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.121
Shanti.

01:01:46.288 --> 01:01:49.833
Shanti. Shanti.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.507
Shanti. Shanti.

01:01:57.674 --> 01:02:00.135
Shanti...

01:02:01.094 --> 01:02:02.470
He's gone.

01:02:03.972 --> 01:02:05.140
Buddha, you won.

01:02:05.307 --> 01:02:08.059
- Way to go, dude.
- All right, Buddha!

01:02:12.188 --> 01:02:15.150
You are the descendants of Buddasi!

01:02:15.317 --> 01:02:18.528
I have been waiting
so long for you.

01:02:18.695 --> 01:02:23.742
You and your friends may pass,
but beware of what's ahead,

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:27.662
for there are more tests
along this path.

01:02:44.512 --> 01:02:49.267
If you need Slither again,
I will be here... waiting.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.687
Good luck, Buddies.

01:02:52.854 --> 01:02:55.649
You heard the serpent dude.
Let's be careful.

01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:57.609
You never know
what's around the next corner.

01:02:57.776 --> 01:03:00.820
In that case,
ladies first.

01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:24.219
Grandpa, look!

01:03:30.892 --> 01:03:34.104
Oh, my.

01:03:35.939 --> 01:03:37.816
It's Cleocatra's tomb.

01:03:37.983 --> 01:03:41.403
We're rich, my dear. We're rich.

01:03:44.322 --> 01:03:48.410
Only in my dreams
have I imagined this moment.

01:03:54.082 --> 01:03:55.458
Hey, Tarik.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:58.920
Tarik, we're alive! Tarik!

01:04:00.088 --> 01:04:02.590
This is a single stone slab.

01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:05.010
It must weigh thousands of pounds.

01:04:05.176 --> 01:04:07.595
There's no way we can open it
without heavy equipment.

01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:09.097
Even then it'll take months.

01:04:09.264 --> 01:04:13.351
No, it won't. Why do you think
I brought the explosives?

01:04:13.518 --> 01:04:15.645
For a fireworks display?

01:04:15.812 --> 01:04:18.231
But the tomb
is thousands of years old.

01:04:18.398 --> 01:04:21.526
- We can't just use dynamite on it.
- Watch me.

01:04:21.693 --> 01:04:24.696
Tarik! Seti! Get the explosives.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.330
Oh, no! Quicksand!

01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:41.379
How will we get across?

01:04:41.546 --> 01:04:42.839
No problem-0, dudes,

01:04:43.006 --> 01:04:45.300
I'm an expert
in all things dirt-related.

01:04:45.467 --> 01:04:46.968
Just roll with it.

01:04:58.021 --> 01:04:59.355
Huh?

01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:06.905
You can make your way
across now, dudes and dudette.

01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:22.504
The discovery of Cleocatra's
tomb is priceless.

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.048
- It belongs to the Egyptian people.
- Oh, please.

01:05:25.215 --> 01:05:27.801
I'm every bit the archeologist
you are, Professor Howard.

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:30.720
I simply do it for profit,
not for silly accolades.

01:05:30.887 --> 01:05:34.182
No, Mr. Wellington, what you do
is illegal and immoral.

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:38.061
Grandpa! There's a slot in the door.

01:05:38.228 --> 01:05:40.980
No, Pete!
Get away from there!

01:05:51.199 --> 01:05:52.117
Huh?

01:05:53.535 --> 01:05:57.831
- The disk. Philip.
- Yes, yes.

01:06:13.138 --> 01:06:15.431
There, you see?
I've gotten you here.

01:06:16.599 --> 01:06:18.017
Come along, Peter.

01:06:24.107 --> 01:06:27.902
That's weird.
The oil torches are lit.

01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:29.320
Someone else is here.

01:06:29.487 --> 01:06:33.783
It can only be those filthy mutts.
They've beaten me to it.

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:37.287
The opening of the door must've
triggered the lighting of the torches.

01:06:37.453 --> 01:06:39.581
What is it, Ubasti? No, no, no.

01:06:39.747 --> 01:06:41.749
Ubasti, come back here.
Ubasti.

01:06:43.293 --> 01:06:45.753
Ubasti. Whoo-hoo, Ubasti.

01:06:46.337 --> 01:06:47.922
Ubasti?

01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:03.354
I sure wish... that ancient
Egyptians... invented elevators.

01:07:09.402 --> 01:07:10.653
Yo, what's the holdup?

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.740
There's something strange
about this hallway.

01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:17.285
You guys are worrying too much.

01:07:17.452 --> 01:07:19.537
This room looks
pretty normal to me.

01:07:19.704 --> 01:07:21.581
Remember what Slither said.

01:07:21.748 --> 01:07:24.459
Ah, that snake's been
trapped here too long.

01:07:24.626 --> 01:07:26.461
He's loony, yo.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.841
And then, B-Dawg
fell into the pit of snakes.

01:07:32.008 --> 01:07:34.052
- Oh, no!
- Don't worry.

01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:38.473
At the last second, Babi grabbed
B-Dawg's tail and save him.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.891
B-Dawg!

01:07:42.185 --> 01:07:45.813
I thought you ran out of the
tomb when the scary snake came.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.941
You worry too much about details.

01:07:48.107 --> 01:07:52.445
Anyway, like I said,
Budderball grabbed B-Dawg's tail.

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:58.451
Hang on, Budderball's
got you by the tail.

01:08:01.037 --> 01:08:03.915
Hurry!

01:08:09.337 --> 01:08:12.674
Ahh. You know what?
I'm gonna bounce.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.551
What do you say I meet you
dawgs back in Fernfield?

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.764
Hmm.

01:08:21.808 --> 01:08:25.353
Hmm. It's ancient writing
called hieroglyphics.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.439
I saw Bedouins playing this,
but much smaller.

01:08:28.606 --> 01:08:32.527
You have to get to the other side,
but can only move on specific squares.

01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:35.363
All right, boys,
let a girl show you the way.

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:50.252
Come on, boys, jump only
on the squares that I did.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:21.617
Dudes, I don't get it.
It's just a big, empty room.

01:09:26.163 --> 01:09:27.665
Not a good sign.

01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:36.674
Mmm.

01:09:40.303 --> 01:09:44.140
- Bugs. I love bugs.
- That's disgusting.

01:09:44.307 --> 01:09:48.435
Hmm. A little slimy when they're
uncooked, but still not bad.

01:09:51.898 --> 01:09:55.985
Dawg, I don't think they
appreciate you eating their cousin.

01:10:01.157 --> 01:10:03.701
Hey, it's another one of those buttons.

01:10:24.055 --> 01:10:26.766
Dudes, this looks like Cleocatra's tomb.

01:10:31.396 --> 01:10:33.815
It's the lost collar of Cleocatra.

01:10:38.528 --> 01:10:41.614
Oh, no. It's a quicksand trap.

01:10:41.781 --> 01:10:44.283
Tarik, we need a bridge.
Lie down.

01:10:46.828 --> 01:10:48.704
Well, all right.
Seti, you lie down.

01:10:48.871 --> 01:10:50.498
Yes, you do it, Seti!

01:10:50.665 --> 01:10:51.958
Tarik!

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.961
- I'm very sorry!
- Well done, well done. Yes, very brave.

01:10:55.128 --> 01:10:57.588
Very brave.

01:11:00.174 --> 01:11:02.635
Are you ready? All right.

01:11:02.802 --> 01:11:06.013
There you go. I got you.
Move it, move it. Careful.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.225
- Careful, Peter. Come on, Peter.
- I'm so sorry.

01:11:09.392 --> 01:11:11.602
Tarik.

01:11:11.769 --> 01:11:13.479
Very safe. Here we go.

01:11:13.646 --> 01:11:15.815
It's OK. Very strong.

01:11:19.026 --> 01:11:21.070
I am coming.

01:11:25.158 --> 01:11:27.368
Right, well, carry on.

01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:31.497
What do you think it means, Grandpa?

01:11:31.664 --> 01:11:33.666
It's raising him up!

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:37.879
Tarik!
Tarik, you're safe!

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:42.049
Tarik, you're safe!

01:11:43.843 --> 01:11:44.969
What should we do?

01:11:45.136 --> 01:11:47.555
We've gotta take the
collar for safekeeping,

01:11:47.722 --> 01:11:50.057
so Ubasti doesn't get her paws on it.

01:11:50.224 --> 01:11:53.853
Not just for us,
but for all mankind and dogkind

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.607
That bling is super fly, yo.
I'll get it.

01:12:07.825 --> 01:12:10.328
B-Dawg, why are you wearing the collar?

01:12:10.495 --> 01:12:13.498
Relax, sis.
I gave that monkey my bling,

01:12:13.664 --> 01:12:16.250
so I'm just borrowing this
until we get home.

01:12:20.713 --> 01:12:21.881
Ubasti?

01:12:22.048 --> 01:12:25.843
Now, if you would kindly hand over
what is rightfully mine.

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:28.179
Seems to me you're outnumbered
five-to-one.

01:12:28.346 --> 01:12:30.806
Hmm. Well, we'll see about that.

01:12:32.808 --> 01:12:37.230
Guys, is it just me,
or are those statues moving?

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:42.985
I believe the numbers just got
more in my favor, Blubberball.

01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:45.613
- Uh-oh.
- I'd like to remain optimistic, but

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.533
they definitely don't seem friendly.

01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:49.992
Run, dudes, run!

01:13:00.628 --> 01:13:02.129
Seti.

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:04.840
Oh.

01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:10.304
Wow, it's like Senet,
the ancient Egyptian board game.

01:13:10.721 --> 01:13:13.391
Well, right, off you go.

01:13:15.893 --> 01:13:17.186
Wait, no. No.

01:13:18.312 --> 01:13:19.814
- No!
- Don't look, Peter.

01:13:21.232 --> 01:13:24.652
Well, Tarik, you're next. Off you go!

01:13:31.117 --> 01:13:32.493
I think we've lost them.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:38.749
Yo, dawgs, I feel kinda weird.

01:13:38.916 --> 01:13:41.085
- Meow!
- Did you just meow?

01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:44.338
Oh, no you didn't
call me a scaredy-cat.

01:13:44.505 --> 01:13:46.757
Them be fighting words. Meow.

01:13:46.924 --> 01:13:49.176
I'm pretty sure you just meowed, dude.

01:13:49.343 --> 01:13:51.262
There's no way I just meowed.

01:13:51.429 --> 01:13:54.640
I believe it's imperative that
we remove the collar from B-Dawg.

01:13:54.807 --> 01:13:56.559
It appears to be
turning him into a cat.

01:13:56.726 --> 01:14:00.354
Meow... No!
You cannot take my bling.

01:14:00.521 --> 01:14:04.650
- Meow!
- B-Dawg, no! Come back here!

01:14:07.278 --> 01:14:08.613
Let's divide and conquer.

01:14:15.369 --> 01:14:18.956
- I can do it, Grandpa.
- Wait, Peter. Listen to me.

01:14:19.123 --> 01:14:20.708
Do it.

01:14:22.543 --> 01:14:25.338
Only jump on the squares
I tell you, all right?

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:26.547
Uh-huh.

01:14:26.714 --> 01:14:28.257
Start here.

01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:31.510
Now, plow.

01:14:33.054 --> 01:14:34.305
Lion.

01:14:35.264 --> 01:14:36.265
Man.

01:14:38.517 --> 01:14:39.852
Trees.

01:14:41.437 --> 01:14:42.897
And life.

01:14:44.315 --> 01:14:45.608
Come on, Grandpa.

01:14:46.317 --> 01:14:47.443
After you.

01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:14.095
Come play in the kitty litter, dudettes.

01:15:42.081 --> 01:15:45.376
That'll teach them to underestimate
a blond with a pink bow.

01:15:56.846 --> 01:15:59.098
Wait. I just need a little lunch break.

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.393
Hey, bugs, bon appétit!

01:16:10.693 --> 01:16:12.528
Ahh!

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:19.660
Whoa! The service must be terrible.

01:16:32.548 --> 01:16:35.509
I believe meditation
can help with your anger issues.

01:16:43.976 --> 01:16:46.645
You will become my supper.

01:17:03.496 --> 01:17:06.874
- It's amazing!
- I don't believe it.

01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:12.171
There's... There's nothing here.

01:17:12.338 --> 01:17:14.173
Someone beat us to it.

01:17:18.844 --> 01:17:22.973
A mouse?
I love chasing mice! Meow!

01:17:38.823 --> 01:17:41.283
It's my worst nightmare.

01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:45.079
I'm turning into a cat.
Get this collar off me!

01:17:50.376 --> 01:17:54.672
- Are you OK, B-Dawg?
- I... I think so.

01:18:01.637 --> 01:18:04.598
Eww, gross, hairball

01:18:04.765 --> 01:18:07.142
I almost crossed over to the dark side.

01:18:12.565 --> 01:18:15.651
- It's finally mine.
- The collar!

01:18:21.532 --> 01:18:23.784
This is, perhaps, the greatest

01:18:23.951 --> 01:18:27.454
historical discovery
since King Tut's tomb!

01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:29.957
You were right, Grandpa.

01:18:39.133 --> 01:18:41.051
The necklace.

01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:43.262
You found it, Ubasti.

01:18:43.429 --> 01:18:47.099
Ooh, bring it to me,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Yes.

01:18:47.266 --> 01:18:49.476
Ow!

01:18:49.643 --> 01:18:52.938
Ubasti!

01:18:55.357 --> 01:19:00.404
Finally, the moment I've
been waiting for my whole life!

01:19:00.571 --> 01:19:03.157
Now is the time for cats to rule.

01:19:03.324 --> 01:19:04.325
Huh?

01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:07.328
First, dogs will be banished.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:17.129
Your best friends here will be
nothing more than my slaves.

01:19:22.009 --> 01:19:23.969
It's happening!

01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:34.480
Ubasti?

01:19:38.692 --> 01:19:39.652
Mudbud?

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:42.780
How did you get here?

01:19:48.494 --> 01:19:51.038
My goodness!

01:19:53.082 --> 01:19:57.002
It's mine.
Get out of my way!

01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:58.712
I'm rich!

01:20:00.631 --> 01:20:03.884
Philip, I can't let you steal
these invaluable artifacts.

01:20:04.051 --> 01:20:06.929
You can't?
I can take anything I like.

01:20:07.096 --> 01:20:09.306
- Who's going to stop me?
- Me!

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.728
Oh, professor,
it might interest you to know

01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:16.855
that I was fencing champion at Oxford.

01:20:18.148 --> 01:20:20.567
So be it!

01:20:28.409 --> 01:20:29.618
Ole!

01:20:29.785 --> 01:20:31.412
En garde.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.164
And he joust.

01:20:35.207 --> 01:20:36.834
- And he parry.
- Ooh.

01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:39.962
And Babi helped swordfight bad man.

01:20:40.129 --> 01:20:43.757
But how could you swordfight if you
weren't there, Uncle Babi? Remember?

01:20:43.924 --> 01:20:45.843
Do you want me to
tell this story or not?

01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:49.054
Now, the ending is coming soon.
Hold on to your banana.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.317
Is that all you've got, old man?

01:21:02.484 --> 01:21:04.319
Nope. This is.

01:21:08.073 --> 01:21:10.284
I... I...

01:21:15.873 --> 01:21:18.542
- Grandpa!
- Peter!

01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:22.421
- Thank you so much.
- What happened?

01:21:22.588 --> 01:21:25.549
It says here there was
a curse put on the gem

01:21:25.716 --> 01:21:28.635
to prevent any cat
from misusing it again.

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:33.432
If a cat was greedy for power,
it would get everlasting life,

01:21:33.599 --> 01:21:36.143
but in the form of a statue.

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:37.352
Philip!

01:21:37.519 --> 01:21:39.021
Let's get him, Grandpa!

01:21:39.188 --> 01:21:41.940
Come back here, Philip!
Get him!

01:21:42.775 --> 01:21:43.776
He's getting away!

01:21:46.987 --> 01:21:48.781
But where's Uncle Babi this whole time?

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:51.033
Good question, my nephew.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.329
It is now time for Uncle Babi
to save the day!

01:21:55.496 --> 01:22:00.542
Babi, the hero of all heroes, the
great adventurer, the world famous...

01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:02.044
<i>OK, OK, I got it.</i>

01:22:02.211 --> 01:22:06.173
<i>Now tell Babu the ending.
I am on the edge of my hammock.</i>

01:22:27.569 --> 01:22:28.904
Let's get him, Cammy.

01:22:35.077 --> 01:22:37.287
- Bad man. Bad man.
- Ow!

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:40.207
- Very, very, very bad man! Bad!
- Ow! Ow!

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.255
- Bad, bad man!
- Get this monkey off my back!

01:22:49.091 --> 01:22:51.218
Nobody messes with my friends.

01:22:55.514 --> 01:22:56.723
I can't see.

01:23:02.563 --> 01:23:07.317
We know all about you, grave robber,
raider of sacred places.

01:23:07.484 --> 01:23:11.905
- Amir Sabak, Egyptian Secret Service.
- Oh.

01:23:12.072 --> 01:23:14.324
You are under arrest,
Mr. Wellington.

01:23:39.266 --> 01:23:42.102
Thank you for your
great discovery, Mr. Howard.

01:23:42.269 --> 01:23:44.104
The Egyptian government
is most grateful,

01:23:44.271 --> 01:23:47.191
and is willing to compensate you
for your efforts, of course.

01:23:47.357 --> 01:23:51.195
- You are a national hero.
- Finding the treasure

01:23:51.361 --> 01:23:53.989
is all the compensation
an archeologist needs.

01:23:54.156 --> 01:23:55.699
And if I'm a hero,

01:23:55.866 --> 01:23:59.912
then my young archeologist
partner is one, too.

01:24:00.078 --> 01:24:02.039
Without him, I wouldn't
be standing here right now

01:24:02.206 --> 01:24:06.710
Thanks, Grandpa, but the Buddies
deserve a lot of the credit.

01:24:06.877 --> 01:24:08.462
We'd like to thank you two dudes.

01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:10.255
We couldn't have done it without you.

01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:13.175
Yeah, dawgs, you two are da bomb.

01:24:13.342 --> 01:24:17.137
- It was Babi's pleasure.
- And mine, too.

01:24:17.304 --> 01:24:18.889
Maybe we'll see you both again.

01:24:19.056 --> 01:24:20.933
Next time there is
a treasure to be found,

01:24:21.099 --> 01:24:22.893
Babi will be happy to help.

01:24:23.602 --> 01:24:26.813
In the name of
Her Majesty, the Queen, untie me!

01:24:27.481 --> 01:24:28.941
Take me to the British Embassy.

01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:30.525
We must go now and take this

01:24:30.692 --> 01:24:32.778
dirty grave robber to the jail,
where he belongs.

01:24:32.945 --> 01:24:34.947
Thank you, again.

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:37.991
If there is anything I can do for you,
please, let me know.

01:24:38.617 --> 01:24:41.995
Amir, I do actually have a request.

01:24:50.254 --> 01:24:53.840
First off, I'd like to thank
the Egyptian government

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:58.470
for allowing the debut
of this great archeological find

01:24:58.637 --> 01:25:03.475
to happen here in our hometown
of Fernfield, saving our museum.

01:25:03.642 --> 01:25:06.186
And I must extend my gratitude

01:25:06.353 --> 01:25:10.649
to six very important
little archeologists.

01:25:10.816 --> 01:25:13.485
First, my grandson, Peter.

01:25:14.194 --> 01:25:16.863
And then, of course, the Buddies!

01:25:17.656 --> 01:25:20.075
And now, without further ado...

01:25:20.867 --> 01:25:24.705
the lost Cat's Eye necklace
of Cleocatra.

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:30.002
Wow.

01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:33.547
If only your great grandpappy,
Digger, could see you.

01:25:33.714 --> 01:25:38.802
Chips off the old block,
five doggone explorer pups.

01:25:38.969 --> 01:25:44.308
- He'd be very proud.
- That's a cool necklace.

01:25:44.474 --> 01:25:47.936
Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it, Pete?

01:25:48.103 --> 01:25:51.815
And I'm glad we found it
so the world can enjoy it, too.

01:25:51.982 --> 01:25:55.068
But I learned a very
important lesson on this trip,

01:25:55.235 --> 01:25:59.406
more valuable than
even gold or jewels

01:25:59.573 --> 01:26:04.411
I have the greatest treasure
in the world right here.

01:26:12.753 --> 01:26:15.130
I hope it will be safe, Amir.

01:26:15.297 --> 01:26:17.924
We wouldn't want that necklace
falling into the wrong hands.

01:26:18.091 --> 01:26:19.259
Worry not, my friend.

01:26:28.643 --> 01:26:31.188
No man will be able to get through that.

01:26:53.919 --> 01:26:56.797
And that is the story
of the greatest treasure

01:26:56.963 --> 01:26:59.424
Babi ever discovered.

01:27:01.593 --> 01:27:05.347
Wait. Where is Babu going?

01:27:05.514 --> 01:27:07.974
That was amazing story, Uncle Babi.

01:27:08.975 --> 01:27:11.478
- But...
- Babi no like "but."

01:27:11.645 --> 01:27:13.647
Babu knows Uncle Babi exaggerates.

01:27:13.814 --> 01:27:15.440
Scare off cat with big muscles,

01:27:15.607 --> 01:27:18.735
save Budderball from snake pit,
swordfight with humans?

01:27:18.902 --> 01:27:23.365
All tall tales. Babu not even sure
Babi is real treasure hunter.

01:27:23.532 --> 01:27:24.950
Babu going back to Cairo

01:27:25.117 --> 01:27:27.744
to see if Babu can get back
into organ grinder school.

01:27:27.911 --> 01:27:29.538
OK, fine, Babu.

01:27:29.704 --> 01:27:33.500
'Tis true, Babi tend to exaggerate,
just a little bit.

01:27:33.667 --> 01:27:36.128
But this adventure story is true.

01:27:36.294 --> 01:27:38.755
Babi really meet the treasure Buddies.

01:27:38.922 --> 01:27:41.758
Sorry, Babi,
you cry monkey too many times.

01:27:41.925 --> 01:27:43.927
Maybe this will change your mind?

01:27:52.144 --> 01:27:54.187
The lost collar of Cleocatra!

01:28:56.917 --> 01:28:59.753
Oh, no you didn't
call me a scaredy-cat.

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.421
Them be fighting words.

01:29:01.588 --> 01:29:05.091
That'll teach them to underestimate
a blond with a pink bow.

01:29:05.258 --> 01:29:06.760
No problem-0, dudes.

01:29:06.927 --> 01:29:09.471
I'm an expert in
all things dirt-related.

01:29:09.638 --> 01:29:11.932
Fate set us on this path, Mudbud.

01:29:12.098 --> 01:29:14.059
Every journey has a deeper reason.

01:29:14.226 --> 01:29:15.936
Over the teeth, past the gums,

01:29:16.102 --> 01:29:18.563
look out stomach,
here the bugs come.

01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:20.398
I met your great grandpappy

01:29:20.565 --> 01:29:22.776
when I was knee-high
to a grasshopper.

01:29:22.943 --> 01:29:27.447
I am Slither, the serpent
protector of Cleocatra's tomb.

01:29:27.614 --> 01:29:31.576
There's nothing I detest more
than a petty primate thief.

01:29:32.244 --> 01:29:35.121
It is a snake.
Babi no like snakes.

01:29:35.288 --> 01:29:37.666
Is this another one
of your tall tales, Uncle Babi?

01:29:37.832 --> 01:29:40.085
My mom says
you exaggerate sometimes.

01:29:40.252 --> 01:29:42.295
Budderball is seeing the mirage.

01:29:42.462 --> 01:29:45.465
The heat makes your brain
do funny things sometimes.

01:29:45.632 --> 01:29:48.426
My name is Mala,
and my tribe would be thrilled

01:29:48.593 --> 01:29:50.303
to have you
as our honored guests.
