00:21.833 --> 00:24.333
¶ ¶

00:34.779 --> 00:36.145
Excuse me?

00:36.147 --> 00:37.680
We are close
to Universal Studios?

00:37.682 --> 00:39.782
It's about
ten miles away.

00:39.784 --> 00:42.718
Oh.

01:11.315 --> 01:13.749
¶ ¶

01:24.362 --> 01:26.429
(bell dings)

01:37.675 --> 01:39.742
(bell dings)

01:42.080 --> 01:44.847
(door closes)

01:44.849 --> 01:47.016
I heard you the first time.

01:47.018 --> 01:48.751
Reservations?

01:59.730 --> 02:03.199
For us, uh,
your hotel is not right.

02:03.201 --> 02:05.601
You will please give
us back our deposit?

02:07.438 --> 02:09.371
No refunds.

02:09.373 --> 02:12.041
But, uh, we need
the money

02:12.043 --> 02:13.609
for the new hotel.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.278
Welcome to America.

02:27.225 --> 02:29.258
Look, you've already
paid for one night.

02:29.260 --> 02:31.627
Trust me.

02:31.629 --> 02:34.230
This place will grow on you.

02:34.232 --> 02:35.865
(elevator bell dings)

02:47.778 --> 02:49.845
(bell dings)

02:54.819 --> 02:56.318
(electricity crackling)

03:05.263 --> 03:07.496
(muffled moaning)

03:09.500 --> 03:13.135
Um, I-I forgot to ask you
the password for Wi-Fi.

03:13.137 --> 03:14.937
We don't have that.

03:14.939 --> 03:17.940
In fact, this whole building
is a dead zone for cell service.

03:17.942 --> 03:21.110
There is a telephone in each
room for your convenience.

03:21.112 --> 03:23.512
Local calls are free.

03:26.817 --> 03:29.952
$50 fee for losing your keys.

03:29.954 --> 03:33.222
Anything else
I can help you with?

03:34.458 --> 03:36.125
Ice?

03:36.127 --> 03:39.461
Ice machine is down
the second hallway to the left.

03:39.463 --> 03:41.197
Knock yourself out.

03:56.147 --> 03:59.114
Terrible accident in room 51;
just ghastly!

04:26.544 --> 04:30.246
¶ ¶

04:41.859 --> 04:44.460
(scooping ice)

04:55.539 --> 04:57.940
¶ ¶

05:39.784 --> 05:42.985
(line ringing)

05:47.591 --> 05:48.924
Front desk.

05:48.926 --> 05:50.125
We must change rooms.

05:50.127 --> 05:51.794
There's a terrible smell
in here.

05:51.796 --> 05:53.595
It's a musty hotel.

05:53.597 --> 05:55.264
Try running
the air conditioner on high.

05:55.266 --> 05:56.598
No, you must
give us another room!

05:56.600 --> 05:57.766
We're sold out.

05:57.768 --> 05:59.001
There's nothing available.

05:59.003 --> 06:00.369
(phone clicks,
dial tone drones)

06:21.292 --> 06:23.359
(both gasp)

06:59.663 --> 07:01.897
(screaming)

07:06.737 --> 07:07.970
(shrieking, groaning)

07:10.674 --> 07:13.409
(screams)

08:24.248 --> 08:25.247
Who was that?!
What was that?

08:25.249 --> 08:27.249
I have no idea.

08:27.251 --> 08:28.951
Honey, I'm just as upset
as you are.
(elevator bell dings)

08:28.953 --> 08:30.953
And I want you to know

08:30.955 --> 08:33.255
you will not be charged
for that room.

08:33.257 --> 08:35.591
I cannot stay in this place
one more second!

08:35.593 --> 08:38.260
The police
will be coming soon.

08:38.262 --> 08:39.962
You can either
give them a statement here

08:39.964 --> 08:41.763
or you can talk to
them later in jail

08:41.765 --> 08:44.433
when they arrest
you for evasion.

08:44.435 --> 08:46.101
I'll get your bags ready.

08:46.103 --> 08:48.770
Until then,

08:48.772 --> 08:50.339
you can stay here.

09:12.196 --> 09:14.630
I thought you said
there was no other room.

09:14.632 --> 09:18.400
This one we never rent out.

09:26.377 --> 09:27.876
(disconnect tone plays)
OPERATOR (recording):
<i> We're sorry.</i>

09:27.878 --> 09:29.378
<i> Your call cannot</i>
<i> be completed as dialed.</i>

09:29.380 --> 09:31.413
<i> Please check the number</i>
<i> and dial again.</i>

09:58.375 --> 10:00.809
(jazz music starts playing)

10:03.714 --> 10:07.115
(static hisses,
music fades in and out)

10:19.863 --> 10:22.164
Aggie?

10:31.609 --> 10:34.109
(music, static continue)

10:51.729 --> 10:53.128
(gasps)

10:56.634 --> 10:57.799
(screams)

11:01.138 --> 11:03.205
(sirens approaching)

11:04.908 --> 11:07.476
So, we think our guy lifted the
master key from housekeeping.

11:07.478 --> 11:09.077
Nobody heard anything?

11:09.079 --> 11:10.278
Looks like both victims
were chloroformed

11:10.280 --> 11:11.613
the second they walked
through the door.

11:11.615 --> 11:13.048
Lovely.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.521
(camera shutter clicking)

11:21.625 --> 11:23.258
Let's get some light in here.

11:23.260 --> 11:25.327
(muffled moaning)

11:41.278 --> 11:44.012
Our victim's eyeballs
are in the ashtray.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.316
And his tongue?

11:48.318 --> 11:50.852
DETECTIVE:
He's in a world of hurt.

11:50.854 --> 11:54.122
(muffled moaning)

11:54.124 --> 11:55.557
(muffled moans
and grunts continue)

11:58.696 --> 12:01.630
DETECTIVE: John, this area's
been documented already.

12:01.632 --> 12:04.166
Not by me.

12:04.168 --> 12:06.702
(muffled moaning)

12:09.873 --> 12:11.940
They were married,
but not to each other.

12:14.812 --> 12:17.846
They were cheating.

12:17.848 --> 12:19.548
Very pissed-off
spouse, maybe.

12:19.550 --> 12:21.550
No, this isn't jealousy.

12:21.552 --> 12:23.285
This is something else.

12:25.355 --> 12:27.022
The killer's saying the families

12:27.024 --> 12:28.690
are blind to what's
been going on.

12:28.692 --> 12:30.158
MAN (muttering):
Get me out of here.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.327
(muttering):
Get... out of here...

12:32.329 --> 12:34.162
Sir...
Get me...

12:34.164 --> 12:35.997
(man sobbing)
Sir.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.866
Sir?

12:37.868 --> 12:39.501
We're gonna get you
out of here.

12:39.503 --> 12:40.569
We promise.

12:40.571 --> 12:42.404
(man continues muttering)

12:48.178 --> 12:51.847
That's not what he's saying.

12:51.849 --> 12:53.849
He's saying,
"Get me out of<i> her."</i>

12:53.851 --> 12:55.350
He's still inside of her.

12:55.352 --> 12:56.885
You're gonna find

12:56.887 --> 12:59.387
male potency drugs in his
system; probably a lot.

12:59.389 --> 13:01.223
You won't be able
to detach them here,

13:01.225 --> 13:03.291
so you're gonna have to
take him with the corpse.

13:05.395 --> 13:07.095
Cut him loose.

13:07.097 --> 13:09.431
(moaning)

13:17.241 --> 13:18.774
You have that report for me?

13:18.776 --> 13:20.242
WOMAN:
Forensics is still on the scene.

13:20.244 --> 13:22.043
No, not from the homicide
this morning.

13:22.045 --> 13:24.346
From the Martin Gamboa case,
last month.

13:35.592 --> 13:37.726
MAN: The victim's name--
Martin Gamboa,

13:37.728 --> 13:39.294
age 47.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.630
Profession listed
as Oscar blogger.

13:41.632 --> 13:44.733
187 occurred in victim's home
in Silver Lake.

13:44.735 --> 13:47.736
Victim died of blunt force
trauma to the head.

13:47.738 --> 13:50.405
There is evidence of wounds
to the legs, arms

13:50.407 --> 13:52.474
and thorax; some defensive.

13:52.476 --> 13:55.076
Whoever did this
wanted him to suffer first.

13:55.078 --> 13:57.612
Fractures to the radius
and ulna of the right arm;

13:57.614 --> 14:00.615
compound fractures
of the humerus of the left arm

14:00.617 --> 14:02.250
bone protrusions
through the skin.

14:02.252 --> 14:05.620
There are traces of what appear
to be gold paint chips

14:05.622 --> 14:10.258
in the rectal cavity as well as
in what is left of the cranium,

14:10.260 --> 14:13.161
so it may be assumed that
whatever the murder weapon was,

14:13.163 --> 14:15.430
was also used
in the sexual assault...

14:15.432 --> 14:17.766
(phone buzzing)

14:17.768 --> 14:18.767
Hi, Dad!

14:18.769 --> 14:19.768
How was school?

14:19.770 --> 14:20.836
Good. Lizzy Cooper threw up

14:20.838 --> 14:22.270
in the middle of spelling.

14:22.272 --> 14:24.606
It was gross and awesome
at the same time.

14:24.608 --> 14:26.942
The boys are calling her
Lizzy Puker now.

14:26.944 --> 14:29.177
How's Mom?
Does she want to talk to me?

14:29.179 --> 14:31.780
Hey, Mom, do you want
to say hi to Dad?

14:31.782 --> 14:33.014
MOM:
No, honey.

14:33.016 --> 14:35.150
GIRL:
Did you eat?

14:35.152 --> 14:36.751
Yes.
Liar.

14:38.522 --> 14:40.188
All right, you ready to read?
It's almost bedtime.

14:40.190 --> 14:42.290
WOMAN:
Lowe?

14:42.292 --> 14:43.458
You got a call
on line three.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.293
Take a message.

14:45.295 --> 14:46.528
Uh, he was pretty adamant.

14:46.530 --> 14:48.964
So am I.

14:48.966 --> 14:50.966
Daddy, you can go.

14:50.968 --> 14:52.300
Nope.

14:52.302 --> 14:53.535
We read at bedtime.

14:53.537 --> 14:54.803
Who's gonna start?

14:54.805 --> 14:56.638
You.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.673
All right.

14:58.675 --> 15:02.143
"Boys are trying enough to
human patience, goodness knows,

15:02.145 --> 15:05.046
"but girls are
infinitely more so..."

15:10.320 --> 15:11.853
Can you cross-reference
the Gamboa forensics

15:11.855 --> 15:14.022
with the hotel case--
prints, everything?

15:14.024 --> 15:16.558
You got it.

15:20.664 --> 15:22.731
(phone buzzing)

15:25.369 --> 15:27.202
Hello?

15:27.204 --> 15:28.837
MAN:
Hello, John.

15:28.839 --> 15:30.839
Why didn't you take my call?

15:30.841 --> 15:31.840
Who is this?

15:31.842 --> 15:33.241
How'd you get this number?

15:33.243 --> 15:35.076
I nailed them to the headboard.

15:35.078 --> 15:37.913
I'm at the Hotel Cortez,
room 64.

15:37.915 --> 15:39.414
I'm going to do it again.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.849
(exhales)

15:40.851 --> 15:41.917
(hangs up)

15:46.390 --> 15:48.456
(bell dings)

15:53.397 --> 15:55.463
(bell dings)

16:01.438 --> 16:03.872
I need a room, one night.
$150.

16:03.874 --> 16:05.774
Says here $30.
That's out of date.

16:05.776 --> 16:08.944
Prices went up
after the remodel.

16:12.215 --> 16:14.115
Okay, well, that's bullshit.

16:20.557 --> 16:22.791
You know what?

16:22.793 --> 16:24.559
It's your lucky day.

16:24.561 --> 16:26.294
Mama's feeling magnanimous.

16:38.241 --> 16:39.708
Room 64.

16:43.413 --> 16:46.014
Oh, elevator's
out of service today.

16:48.418 --> 16:50.719
(sighs)

17:00.764 --> 17:02.831
I've got dibs
on this one, Iris.

17:05.602 --> 17:07.669
I haven't seen one
that sweet in a while.

17:12.109 --> 17:14.109
(indistinct pounding)

17:14.111 --> 17:15.477
(muffled screaming)

17:15.479 --> 17:17.545
(babies crying)

17:26.990 --> 17:30.025
¶ ¶

17:49.813 --> 17:53.048
¶ I had a face on the mirror ¶

17:56.319 --> 17:59.788
¶ I had a hand on the gun ¶

18:02.893 --> 18:05.894
¶ I had a place in the sun ¶

18:05.896 --> 18:10.398
¶ And a ticket to Syria... ¶

18:12.235 --> 18:16.404
¶ I had everything
within my reach ¶

18:16.406 --> 18:18.740
¶ I had money and stuff ¶

18:20.510 --> 18:23.745
¶ Each and every call... ¶

18:28.685 --> 18:30.351
¶ Too much and never enough... ¶

18:30.353 --> 18:32.020
When people die,
they soil the sheets--

18:32.022 --> 18:34.189
blood, shit, urine.

18:34.191 --> 18:35.657
I can take care
of every stain there is.

18:39.696 --> 18:40.962
(laughs)

18:42.866 --> 18:45.166
(screaming):
Aah! Help me!

19:11.061 --> 19:12.393
Woof.

19:12.395 --> 19:14.395
You're a sight
for sore eyes,

19:14.397 --> 19:16.965
Mr. Police Officer.

19:16.967 --> 19:19.400
It's that obvious, huh?
Mm-hmm.

19:19.402 --> 19:22.804
You must have a lot
of run-ins with police.

19:22.806 --> 19:24.639
My fair share.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.942
What can you tell me
about the occupant in room 64?

19:27.944 --> 19:30.645
That room's vacant.

19:34.084 --> 19:36.584
You mind if I take
a quick look?

19:36.586 --> 19:39.787
Oh, be my guest.

19:39.789 --> 19:41.856
Liz Taylor.

19:44.427 --> 19:46.861
Show this nice policeman
to room 64.

19:48.798 --> 19:50.431
64?
Yes.

19:50.433 --> 19:51.799
Room 64.

19:51.801 --> 19:54.269
Right away.

19:54.271 --> 19:56.104
(man screams)

19:56.106 --> 19:58.206
Help me!

19:58.942 --> 20:00.842
Help me!

20:02.179 --> 20:05.446
¶ I had a place in the sun ¶

20:05.448 --> 20:10.418
¶ And a ticket to Syria ¶

20:13.290 --> 20:15.490
¶ I had everything
within my reach ¶

20:15.492 --> 20:18.359
¶ I had money and stuff ¶

20:19.462 --> 20:23.031
¶ Each and every call ¶

20:27.470 --> 20:28.970
(screaming)

20:28.972 --> 20:31.806
¶ Too much but never enough ¶

20:31.808 --> 20:34.142
¶ Tear it up
and watch it fall... ¶

20:34.144 --> 20:38.046
The more you scream,
the more he likes it.

20:38.048 --> 20:40.181
What can you tell me
about the people

20:40.183 --> 20:41.649
that come in and
out of this place?

20:41.651 --> 20:43.484
They mostly residents
or transients?

20:43.486 --> 20:44.852
Oh, we got a bit
of everything.

20:44.854 --> 20:47.488
Some pay by the month,
some pay by the hour.

20:47.490 --> 20:51.492
Some of the old-timers have been
here since the dawn of time.

20:51.494 --> 20:53.328
And you?

20:53.330 --> 20:55.330
Who are you looking for?

20:55.332 --> 20:56.698
Not at liberty to say.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.499
Oh, I don't mean that.

20:58.501 --> 21:01.502
I can see the pain
in your eyes.

21:01.504 --> 21:03.905
It's very familiar.

21:03.907 --> 21:06.908
Oh, you've lost something.

21:06.910 --> 21:10.745
And now you're
frozen in time.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.580
Can't move forward.

21:12.582 --> 21:15.083
Can't go back.

21:16.353 --> 21:18.186
<i> (man screams)</i>

21:18.188 --> 21:20.021
Tell me you love me.

21:20.023 --> 21:22.724
(screaming continues)

21:22.726 --> 21:24.726
Say it!

21:24.728 --> 21:28.363
Say, "I love you, Sally,"
and it will all go away.

21:28.365 --> 21:30.765
Say it.

21:30.767 --> 21:33.501
I love you, Sally.

21:35.905 --> 21:37.572
Say it again.

21:37.574 --> 21:41.109
Say it... again.

21:48.618 --> 21:50.685
I love you, Sally.

21:53.223 --> 21:55.290
(song ends)

22:22.919 --> 22:24.986
(elevator bell dings)

22:50.113 --> 22:52.580
All right, I'll take
it from here.

22:56.953 --> 22:59.787
I don't have
any cash.

22:59.789 --> 23:01.856
Money isn't everything.

23:08.998 --> 23:11.032
(door creaking)

23:28.485 --> 23:30.385
¶ ¶

23:49.672 --> 23:51.739
¶ ¶

24:17.534 --> 24:20.301
(breathing anxiously)

24:49.432 --> 24:50.498
(sudden gasp)

24:52.469 --> 24:54.902
(radio plays jazz)

24:54.904 --> 24:57.371
(static hisses,
music fades in and out)

25:17.260 --> 25:18.493
(child laughs)

25:18.495 --> 25:20.495
(music, static continue)

25:20.497 --> 25:22.563
Holden?

25:31.007 --> 25:33.074
(panting)

25:41.284 --> 25:43.251
(jazz continues distantly,
child laughing)

25:53.963 --> 25:56.030
(panting)

25:58.468 --> 26:00.535
¶ ¶

26:26.062 --> 26:28.229
(upbeat pop intro plays)

26:53.523 --> 26:55.590
¶ ¶

27:06.235 --> 27:09.370
¶ Got a big plan, his mind's
set, maybe it's right ¶

27:09.372 --> 27:12.373
¶ At the right place
and right time, maybe tonight ¶

27:12.375 --> 27:15.376
¶ In a whisper or handshake,
sending the sign ¶

27:15.378 --> 27:18.779
¶ Want to make out and
kiss hard; wait, never mind ¶

27:18.781 --> 27:21.616
¶ Late night, in passing,
mention it ¶

27:21.618 --> 27:24.619
¶ Flip to her best friend, it's
no thing, maybe it slipped ¶

27:24.621 --> 27:28.389
¶ But the slip turns to terror
and a crush to like ¶

27:28.391 --> 27:31.559
¶ And she walked, he froze up,
leave it to fright ¶

27:31.561 --> 27:35.129
¶ It's cute in a way
till you cannot speak ¶

27:35.131 --> 27:37.565
¶ And you leave to have
a cigarette, knees get weak ¶

27:37.567 --> 27:40.568
¶ Escape was just a nod
and a casual wave ¶

27:40.570 --> 27:44.071
¶ Obsess about it,
heavy for the next two days ¶

27:44.073 --> 27:46.907
¶ It's only just a crush,
it'll go away ¶

27:46.909 --> 27:50.311
¶ It's just like
all the others, it'll go away ¶

27:50.313 --> 27:53.581
¶ Or maybe this is danger,
and you just don't know ¶

27:53.583 --> 27:56.951
¶ You pray it all away,
but it continues to grow ¶

27:56.953 --> 28:00.421
¶<i> Ah...</i> ¶
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

28:00.423 --> 28:02.623
¶ Skin pressed
against me tight ¶

28:02.625 --> 28:06.460
¶ Lie still,
close your eyes, girl ¶

28:06.462 --> 28:08.929
¶ So lovely, it feels so right ¶

28:08.931 --> 28:12.333
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

28:12.335 --> 28:16.337
¶ Soft breath, beating heart ¶

28:16.339 --> 28:19.774
¶ As I whisper in your ear ¶

28:19.776 --> 28:21.909
¶ "I want to tear you apart" ¶

28:33.456 --> 28:35.456
¶ Then he walked up
and told her ¶

28:35.458 --> 28:37.458
¶ Thinking maybe it'd pass ¶

28:37.460 --> 28:40.461
¶ And they talked and looked
away a lot, doing the dance ¶

28:40.463 --> 28:43.464
¶ Her hand brushed up against
his, she left it there ¶

28:43.466 --> 28:46.467
¶ Told him how she felt, and
then they locked in a stare ¶

28:46.469 --> 28:49.970
¶ They took a step back, thought
about it, what should they do? ¶

28:49.972 --> 28:51.372
¶ 'Cause there's
always repercussions ¶

28:51.374 --> 28:53.507
¶ When you're dating in school ¶

28:53.509 --> 28:56.477
¶ But their lips met, and
reservations started to pass ¶

28:56.479 --> 28:57.878
¶ Whether this was
just an evening ¶

28:57.880 --> 28:59.714
¶ Or a thing that would last ¶

28:59.716 --> 29:02.149
¶ Either way he wanted her,
and this was bad ¶

29:02.151 --> 29:05.986
¶ Wanted to do things to her,
it was making him crazy ¶

29:05.988 --> 29:08.322
¶ Now a little crush
turned into a like ¶

29:08.324 --> 29:12.326
¶ And now he wants to grab her
by the hair and tell her ¶

29:12.328 --> 29:15.329
¶<i> Ah...</i> ¶
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

29:15.331 --> 29:18.666
¶ Skin pressed
against me tight ¶

29:18.668 --> 29:21.669
¶ Lie still,
close your eyes, girl ¶

29:21.671 --> 29:24.839
¶ So lovely, it feels so right ¶

29:24.841 --> 29:27.842
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

29:27.844 --> 29:31.245
¶ Soft breath, beating heart ¶

29:31.247 --> 29:34.682
¶ As I whisper in your ear ¶

29:34.684 --> 29:37.752
¶ "I want to tear you apart" ¶

30:07.416 --> 30:10.151
¶ ¶

30:39.949 --> 30:43.417
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

30:43.419 --> 30:46.420
¶ Skin pressed
against me tight ¶

30:46.422 --> 30:49.423
¶ Lie still,
close your eyes, girl ¶

30:49.425 --> 30:53.260
¶ So lovely, it feels so right ¶

30:53.262 --> 30:56.263
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

30:56.265 --> 30:59.266
¶ Soft breath, beating heart ¶

30:59.268 --> 31:02.636
¶ As I whisper in your ear ¶

31:02.638 --> 31:05.873
¶ "I want to tear you apart" ¶

31:27.663 --> 31:30.965
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

31:30.967 --> 31:33.634
¶ Skin pressed
against me tight ¶

31:33.636 --> 31:36.637
¶ Lie still,
close your eyes, girl ¶

31:36.639 --> 31:39.640
¶ So lovely, it feels so right ¶

31:39.642 --> 31:42.643
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

31:42.645 --> 31:45.479
¶ Soft breath, beating heart ¶

31:45.481 --> 31:48.549
¶ As I whisper in your ear ¶

31:48.551 --> 31:51.685
¶ "I want to tear you apart" ¶

31:51.687 --> 31:55.322
¶ I want to hold you close ¶

31:55.324 --> 31:58.325
¶ Soft breath, beating heart ¶

31:58.327 --> 32:02.329
¶ As I whisper in your ear ¶

32:02.331 --> 32:05.065
¶ "I want to tear you apart." ¶

32:07.837 --> 32:11.238
And you didn't feel
like going out tonight.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.241
It's not the getting ready.

32:14.243 --> 32:17.244
It's the cleanup.

32:17.246 --> 32:19.313
Call housekeeping.

32:30.026 --> 32:32.259
(dog barking in distance)

32:45.541 --> 32:46.874
GIRL:
Daddy!

32:46.876 --> 32:47.875
Hey.

32:47.877 --> 32:49.376
(growls playfully)

32:49.378 --> 32:51.745
(barks)
That's what I've
been looking for.

32:51.747 --> 32:53.213
How you doing?

32:53.215 --> 32:54.214
Good, how are you?

32:54.216 --> 32:55.215
Hey, sorry I'm late.

32:55.217 --> 32:56.784
Did you get my text?

32:56.786 --> 32:58.719
Yes, and it's clearly
more considerate than you,

32:58.721 --> 33:00.721
'cause it showed up at 6:00
like you were supposed to.

33:00.723 --> 33:02.723
Sorry.

33:02.725 --> 33:04.091
Have a kid with a sprained ankle
in Beverly Hills

33:04.093 --> 33:05.292
and twins with possible
whooping cough

33:05.294 --> 33:06.293
in the Palisades right after.

33:06.295 --> 33:07.728
Whooping cough.

33:07.730 --> 33:09.129
Can you believe it?
Let me help your mom.

33:09.131 --> 33:10.564
What's wrong
with people?

33:10.566 --> 33:12.232
I don't care
how much they pay me,

33:12.234 --> 33:14.268
I refuse to see parents
who won't "vax" their kids.

33:14.270 --> 33:16.136
Doctor.

33:20.943 --> 33:23.310
I made that quinoa
casserole you two like.

33:23.312 --> 33:25.779
Oh, good.

33:25.781 --> 33:28.148
You okay?

33:29.585 --> 33:30.584
Yeah, yeah.

33:30.586 --> 33:31.952
Just hungry, I think.

33:31.954 --> 33:33.787
Well, next time
you should eat

33:33.789 --> 33:36.790
the protein bar I
stuffed in your pocket.

33:36.792 --> 33:38.258
Love you.
Bye, Mom.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.526
Love you.

33:41.263 --> 33:42.629
(door closes)

33:42.631 --> 33:44.465
Sushi?

33:44.467 --> 33:45.799
Read my mind.

33:45.801 --> 33:47.001
Yeah.

33:49.939 --> 33:52.373
(tray rattling)

34:04.453 --> 34:07.955
WOMAN:
Please, let us go.

34:07.957 --> 34:09.323
Eh, stop your whining.

34:09.325 --> 34:11.191
You brought this on yourselves.

34:11.193 --> 34:12.826
(sobbing)

34:12.828 --> 34:14.828
I went through your shit.

34:14.830 --> 34:16.964
Looks like the two of you were
planning quite the party.

34:16.966 --> 34:19.166
Xanax. Klonopin.

34:19.168 --> 34:20.701
Whatever the hell
those pink pills were.

34:20.703 --> 34:22.469
Those are for sleeping.

34:22.471 --> 34:24.204
Your mothers know you're
a couple of shameless junkies?

34:24.206 --> 34:26.840
You're polluting your bodies
with all that shit.

34:26.842 --> 34:29.176
You dumb Swedish meatballs!

34:29.178 --> 34:31.545
Well, we're gonna
fix that right up.

34:33.682 --> 34:36.316
Yeah, we're gonna
flush your system,

34:36.318 --> 34:38.485
bring you back to the
epitome of health.

34:38.487 --> 34:41.055
Just look at the spread
we got for you today.

34:41.057 --> 34:42.656
No, please...

34:42.658 --> 34:44.024
Oysters.

34:44.026 --> 34:46.326
Full of zinc and B12.

34:46.328 --> 34:48.695
Please, don't, no, no...
Boost your immunity,

34:48.697 --> 34:50.831
help your wounds
heal faster.

34:50.833 --> 34:53.000
And we got you some
chicken livers...

34:53.002 --> 34:54.334
No...

34:54.336 --> 34:57.337
...kidneys, packed with iron.

34:57.339 --> 34:59.573
Get those red blood cells
pumping.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.875
And to top it off,

35:01.877 --> 35:04.445
a Châteauneuf-du-Pape
Grenache blanc.

35:05.514 --> 35:07.247
Yeah.

35:07.249 --> 35:08.882
Please. Please, don't.
Mmm.

35:08.884 --> 35:10.084
Shut up.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.720
This is just the thing
to get your bodies

35:13.722 --> 35:16.023
to absorb all these nutrients.

35:16.025 --> 35:19.193
No... no, please...

35:19.195 --> 35:21.862
Stop!
Please don't make us...

35:21.864 --> 35:25.599
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

35:25.601 --> 35:28.535
No! No, please!
But I'm not leaving

35:28.537 --> 35:31.905
until you get all
your vitamins and minerals.

35:31.907 --> 35:34.108
Please, stop.

35:36.212 --> 35:38.212
All right. Come on.

35:38.214 --> 35:40.581
No! No! No!
Breakfast of champions.

35:40.583 --> 35:41.915
Open your mouth.

35:41.917 --> 35:43.383
No, no!

35:43.385 --> 35:46.420
SALLY: Do you really need
to be so aggressive?

35:46.422 --> 35:49.456
Can't you have some compassion?

35:53.229 --> 35:55.062
You get the hell out of here.

35:55.064 --> 35:57.631
You don't give a shit
about these girls.
And you do?

35:57.633 --> 35:59.299
I've seen what your
caring looks like.

35:59.301 --> 36:00.968
We've all seen it.

36:00.970 --> 36:02.970
Yeah, well, at least
I care about something.

36:02.972 --> 36:05.405
Think I want to be here,
surrounded by junkies and decay?

36:05.407 --> 36:08.242
Well, then why don't
you leave? Go.

36:08.244 --> 36:11.912
You've been whining about
the same thing for 20 years.

36:11.914 --> 36:14.281
You talk a good talk,

36:14.283 --> 36:17.918
but you stick around because
the truth is you like it.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
No.

36:19.922 --> 36:23.323
I'm stuck in this
godforsaken cesspool

36:23.325 --> 36:26.093
of pain and shit
'cause of you.

36:26.095 --> 36:27.294
Eh.

36:27.296 --> 36:28.829
You're the beginning
and the end

36:28.831 --> 36:30.097
of all my suffering.

36:30.099 --> 36:32.332
Good.

36:34.303 --> 36:36.303
Well, I'm done.

36:36.305 --> 36:37.938
Done with your bullshit.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.607
Done with it all.

36:40.609 --> 36:42.442
You think you can
do this better?

36:42.444 --> 36:43.944
Then you do it yourself.

36:43.946 --> 36:46.613
But you better
do a good job,

36:46.615 --> 36:50.417
otherwise you can explain to<i> her</i>
why they still taste like shit.

36:52.021 --> 36:54.021
(sighs)

36:54.023 --> 36:56.924
Now I gotta go feed
that thing in room 33.

36:59.361 --> 37:01.195
WOMAN (sobbing):
Please.

37:01.197 --> 37:02.629
Please.

37:02.631 --> 37:04.698
(both women sobbing)

37:11.507 --> 37:13.507
Do you know what
this room used to be?

37:13.509 --> 37:17.978
This old dude used to put on
puppet shows right there.

37:17.980 --> 37:21.281
Marionettes, strings,
for entertainment.

37:22.484 --> 37:23.750
And now you...

37:24.853 --> 37:26.587
...are going to entertain me.

37:31.193 --> 37:33.961
Move me with your tears.

37:39.034 --> 37:41.235
Run.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.571
Run!

38:08.030 --> 38:09.796
Oh, crap.

38:16.939 --> 38:18.772
(gasping)

38:43.232 --> 38:45.232
I don't know what happened.

38:45.234 --> 38:47.234
She got loose somehow.

38:47.236 --> 38:48.869
This can never happen again.

39:00.249 --> 39:02.316
(elevator bell dings)

39:25.941 --> 39:28.608
Shouldn't we ask if any
of this fish is from Japan?

39:28.610 --> 39:30.177
Why?

39:30.179 --> 39:31.445
Radiation.

39:31.447 --> 39:33.146
(chuckles)

39:33.148 --> 39:34.981
You're starting to
sound like your mother.

39:34.983 --> 39:36.516
She always said she had
a good reason to worry.

39:39.021 --> 39:41.188
I had a dream about him
again last night.

39:42.524 --> 39:44.624
I can't see
his face anymore.

39:44.626 --> 39:47.627
I can't remember it
except in my dreams,

39:47.629 --> 39:49.996
then I can really see it.

39:49.998 --> 39:52.999
When I wake up...

39:53.001 --> 39:55.469
I can't remember.

39:55.471 --> 39:58.538
Do you remember what he looks
like when you're awake?

40:01.310 --> 40:03.377
Yeah.

40:05.314 --> 40:07.781
Maybe we should put
the pictures up again.

40:11.820 --> 40:13.887
(cell phone chimes)

40:15.324 --> 40:17.324
No electronics
at the dinner table.

40:17.326 --> 40:19.059
It's your mom.

40:22.531 --> 40:24.831
(phone line rings)

40:24.833 --> 40:27.501
ALEX: You've reached Alex,
please leave a message.

40:27.503 --> 40:30.537
(home alarm wailing)

40:30.539 --> 40:32.005
(tires screeching)

40:32.007 --> 40:33.840
GIRL: Dad, what's happening?!
Been inside yet?

40:33.842 --> 40:35.242
OFFICER: No, I just got here.
What's going on, Detective?

40:35.244 --> 40:37.077
JOHN: I don't know yet.
Watch my daughter.

40:37.079 --> 40:39.579
(home alarm continues wailing)

40:45.754 --> 40:48.255
(alarm continues wailing)

40:55.697 --> 40:57.764
(indistinct radio communication)

40:58.700 --> 41:00.467
(leaves rustling)

41:08.877 --> 41:11.745
(alarm continues wailing)

41:11.747 --> 41:13.814
(cell phone buzzes)

41:16.752 --> 41:19.085
Alex, are you okay?

41:19.087 --> 41:20.587
KILLER:
John Lowe.

41:20.589 --> 41:22.055
Who is this?

41:22.057 --> 41:23.457
Where's my wife?!

41:23.459 --> 41:25.659
I told you I'd do it again.

41:47.583 --> 41:49.649
(alarm continues wailing)

42:02.965 --> 42:05.365
Show me your hands!

42:11.273 --> 42:13.673
(alarm continues wailing)

42:24.953 --> 42:26.152
JOHN:
Stop...

42:26.154 --> 42:27.521
Stop!

42:33.962 --> 42:36.429
(alarm continues wailing)

42:46.808 --> 42:48.608
(screaming)

42:50.012 --> 42:52.078
Scarlett!

42:54.016 --> 42:56.550
(alarm continues wailing)

43:14.870 --> 43:15.869
JOHN: All right, honey,
you got it?

43:15.871 --> 43:16.870
Oh, so close.

43:16.872 --> 43:18.071
Boom!

43:18.073 --> 43:19.406
I'm gonna take Holden
to the carousel.

43:20.342 --> 43:22.175
Come on, buddy.

43:22.177 --> 43:23.577
(gasps) Slow it down,
slow it down.

43:23.579 --> 43:25.011
Remember, hold it
like a pencil.

43:25.013 --> 43:26.413
Throw it like a baseball.

43:26.415 --> 43:27.847
Concentrate on where
you want it to go.

43:27.849 --> 43:29.583
Ready? Go.

43:30.185 --> 43:32.285
Oh! Good job!

43:34.256 --> 43:36.690
You hungry, buddy?

43:36.692 --> 43:38.692
Yeah, I want some
cotton candy.

43:38.694 --> 43:40.093
(chuckles)

43:40.095 --> 43:42.095
You got to eat
some real food first.

43:42.097 --> 43:44.531
I'm not hungry for that.

43:44.533 --> 43:47.434
No? All right,
we'll get something after.

43:51.406 --> 43:53.406
Here you go.

43:53.408 --> 43:55.275
Now you got one
with yellow feet.

43:55.277 --> 43:57.277
He's a special one.

43:57.279 --> 43:58.712
Don't go too fast.

43:58.714 --> 44:00.780
(cell phone buzzes)

44:11.793 --> 44:14.361
(people screaming, shouting)

44:28.243 --> 44:29.309
Holden?

44:31.813 --> 44:34.247
Hey, you seen my boy?

44:34.249 --> 44:36.082
He was on that horse
with the yellow feet.

44:36.084 --> 44:37.484
Holden!

44:39.254 --> 44:40.754
Holden!

44:40.756 --> 44:42.155
Holden?!

44:43.659 --> 44:45.725
Holden?!

44:48.130 --> 44:49.195
Holden!

44:51.299 --> 44:54.768
Holden! Holden!

44:54.770 --> 44:56.770
ALEX:
I mean, maybe we should
just go stay with Mary.

44:56.772 --> 44:59.305
JOHN:
In New Hampshire? I don't want
to do that to Scarlett.

44:59.307 --> 45:00.840
It's already gonna be
hard enough as it is.

45:00.842 --> 45:02.475
She should be able
to sleep in her own bed.

45:02.477 --> 45:05.979
I'm gonna have two uniformed
men with you at all times.

45:05.981 --> 45:08.148
One's gonna go to school
with Scarlett, one's gonna go

45:08.150 --> 45:10.316
to work with you, and these guys
are very good at what they do.

45:10.318 --> 45:12.018
You're not even gonna know they
are there unless you need them.

45:12.020 --> 45:13.386
Do you even know
what this guy looks like?

45:14.956 --> 45:17.791
I don't understand
how he texted you from my phone.

45:17.793 --> 45:20.794
I mean, do you think that
he knows where we live?

45:20.796 --> 45:22.162
Jesus, John.

45:22.164 --> 45:23.697
What are we gonna do, huh?

45:23.699 --> 45:25.365
Maybe I should
get a gun.

45:25.367 --> 45:28.702
No. No, you-you don't need
to get a gun, all right?

45:28.704 --> 45:30.503
There are ways to clone
somebody's phone.

45:30.505 --> 45:31.805
Don't worry.

45:31.807 --> 45:33.006
I'm gonna keep you guys safe.

45:33.008 --> 45:34.641
What, by moving out?

45:34.643 --> 45:36.476
I have a feeling he's
gonna come after me again,

45:36.478 --> 45:38.645
and if that happens, I don't
want either of you near me.

45:38.647 --> 45:40.714
Look, I'm not upset
because you're leaving.

45:43.819 --> 45:46.820
I'm upset because I...

45:46.822 --> 45:48.722
I secretly want you to go.

45:50.659 --> 45:52.225
I-I understand. You...

45:52.227 --> 45:53.827
I shouldn't have brought
Scarlett to that house.

45:53.829 --> 45:55.328
I thought you
were in trouble,

45:55.330 --> 45:56.696
I-I told that idiot
cop to watch her.

45:56.698 --> 45:58.665
I'm not mad about that.

45:58.667 --> 46:01.568
I know you would never
put her in danger.

46:04.005 --> 46:06.005
And I don't blame you
for Holden.

46:06.007 --> 46:08.475
No matter
what you think.

46:11.847 --> 46:14.681
I love you so much.

46:14.683 --> 46:16.683
He just looked so much like you.

46:16.685 --> 46:19.686
I see him in your
face every day,

46:19.688 --> 46:21.588
and I just
want to die.

46:21.590 --> 46:24.424
It's not fair-- they took
my little boy from me,

46:24.426 --> 46:26.526
and I can't even look
at the one person in the world

46:26.528 --> 46:27.861
who understands how I feel.

46:27.863 --> 46:29.863
I just need a break
from it all.

46:29.865 --> 46:31.464
Do you ever hope?

46:34.603 --> 46:36.469
I can't stop hoping.

46:37.439 --> 46:39.305
That's the worst part.

46:46.548 --> 46:49.616
¶ ¶

47:01.563 --> 47:02.862
Welcome.

47:06.401 --> 47:07.634
The rain may have stopped,

47:07.636 --> 47:09.736
but it's still a gloomy day.

47:09.738 --> 47:11.638
I had to put my dog down.

47:11.640 --> 47:15.775
He came to me through very
unfortunate circumstances.

47:15.777 --> 47:18.278
But you don't need
to hear about that.

47:18.280 --> 47:19.813
Right this way.

47:21.750 --> 47:24.584
So many buildings around here
are time capsules,

47:24.586 --> 47:27.453
locked away by
an impersonal business trust.

47:27.455 --> 47:28.955
I prefer dealing
with a trust.

47:28.957 --> 47:30.790
Anonymous.
Unsentimental.

47:30.792 --> 47:33.426
So you'll live here,
or just work here?

47:33.428 --> 47:35.595
I know that you were
interested in the top floor.

47:35.597 --> 47:37.130
We're moving
our life out here.

47:37.132 --> 47:39.265
Work, home-- I've never
kept them separate.

47:39.267 --> 47:41.301
It's very clear to me: the art
world has looked to L.A.,

47:41.303 --> 47:42.635
and fashion is
soon to follow.

47:42.637 --> 47:45.104
The top floor is
where I'll live

47:45.106 --> 47:46.940
and just below will be an
atelier, mostly ready-to-wear.

47:46.942 --> 47:48.408
Lachlan!

47:49.344 --> 47:51.010
Lachlan!

47:52.948 --> 47:54.013
Lachlan?

47:54.015 --> 47:55.248
Oh.

47:56.451 --> 47:57.984
So much energy.

47:57.986 --> 47:59.786
IRIS:
How can I help you?

47:59.788 --> 48:02.155
Uh, I'm the Realtor

48:02.157 --> 48:04.791
representing the sale.
We're here for the walk-through.

48:04.793 --> 48:06.192
We'll let you know
if we need anything.

48:06.194 --> 48:07.460
Sale?

48:07.462 --> 48:08.695
What sale?

48:08.697 --> 48:10.196
MARCY:
Well, I know it was

48:10.198 --> 48:12.298
a whisper listing,
but surely,

48:12.300 --> 48:14.133
the owner should
have told you.

48:14.135 --> 48:15.802
Nobody tells me shit.

48:15.804 --> 48:17.370
I've never even met the owner.

48:17.372 --> 48:18.671
MARCY: Well, you
have now, dearie.

48:18.673 --> 48:21.474
This is the new owner,
Mr. Will Drake.

48:21.476 --> 48:23.543
We'll start
with the penthouse?

48:23.545 --> 48:25.979
We'll let you know
if we need anything.

48:25.981 --> 48:28.448
(keys jingling)

48:42.898 --> 48:46.266
We're gonna be turned
out onto the streets.

48:53.675 --> 48:55.742
(elevator bell dings)

49:06.888 --> 49:08.855
(hisses)

49:08.857 --> 49:10.556
The clouds have cleared.

49:10.558 --> 49:12.859
Sightlines all the way
to the Pacific.

49:12.861 --> 49:13.893
DONOVAN:
Close it!

49:13.895 --> 49:15.795
The light!

49:19.567 --> 49:21.768
Who the hell are you people?

49:26.041 --> 49:29.442
And what are you doing
in my room?

49:29.444 --> 49:32.211
We've been invaded.

49:32.213 --> 49:34.247
Shanghaied!

49:34.249 --> 49:38.084
Some goddamn New Yorker
is sizing up my suite.

49:38.086 --> 49:40.386
A little early
for you, isn't it?

49:40.388 --> 49:42.388
MARCY:
I know you'll
prefer the view

49:42.390 --> 49:44.223
from the space
we just saw,

49:44.225 --> 49:46.893
but here's the other half
of the floor plan.

49:46.895 --> 49:49.462
The lighting is,
of course, a challenge

49:49.464 --> 49:52.298
and I don't know if all
this neon is the answer.

49:52.300 --> 49:54.133
Will Drake.

49:54.135 --> 49:55.969
I'm so pleased to meet you.

49:58.406 --> 49:59.973
I was completely impressed
with the gown you made

49:59.975 --> 50:01.441
for Mrs. Obama.

50:01.443 --> 50:03.109
It was the state dinner for...

50:03.111 --> 50:04.577
the Spaniards...
The Spaniards, yes.

50:04.579 --> 50:05.979
Kind of you to mention.

50:07.916 --> 50:10.249
I'm on a cleanse.

50:10.251 --> 50:12.352
Not anymore.

50:18.426 --> 50:21.427
(snaps fingers)
Lachlan! Honestly.

50:21.429 --> 50:22.662
Fingerprints are
really hard to get off.

50:22.664 --> 50:24.497
Messes are always forgiven.

50:25.967 --> 50:28.334
The first time.

50:30.839 --> 50:32.772
Is...
Yes.

50:32.774 --> 50:34.173
It's an Arik Levy

50:34.175 --> 50:35.775
and it doesn't come
with the building.

50:35.777 --> 50:39.278
Of course, I'm hopeful
you're as interested

50:39.280 --> 50:41.514
in the character
of The Cortez as we are.

50:44.119 --> 50:45.318
There's energy here.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.320
I walk through New York streets

50:47.322 --> 50:48.788
and I don't hear
the music anymore.

50:48.790 --> 50:52.291
No more echoes
of what was there.

50:52.293 --> 50:55.161
Blocks are toppled,
history erased,

50:55.163 --> 50:56.796
weirdoes banished.

50:56.798 --> 50:58.998
This place is
far enough away

50:59.000 --> 51:00.633
that it speaks to me...

51:00.635 --> 51:01.834
sings, even.

51:01.836 --> 51:03.202
Well, I cannot wait

51:03.204 --> 51:04.704
to see what you make of it.

51:06.307 --> 51:07.974
Wow, that's...
that's really beautiful.

51:07.976 --> 51:09.842
So where are weirdoes like us

51:09.844 --> 51:11.377
supposed to live, huh?

51:12.814 --> 51:16.649
Got any songs telling you
anything about that?

51:16.651 --> 51:18.551
Perhaps you could
show our neighbor

51:18.553 --> 51:20.453
the James Turrell
light sculpture?

51:33.501 --> 51:35.001
Dad, can I stay
and look at the records?

51:35.003 --> 51:37.570
Of course you can.

51:42.677 --> 51:45.244
People aren't supposed
to live in hotels.

51:46.581 --> 51:48.648
Well, maybe this place
is special.

51:52.387 --> 51:54.754
I want to show you
something you'll enjoy.

51:56.424 --> 51:58.257
We'll only be gone a moment.

51:58.259 --> 51:59.792
(elevator bell dings)

52:03.932 --> 52:06.566
I lived in New York,
many years ago.

52:06.568 --> 52:08.701
I loved roaming the streets,

52:08.703 --> 52:10.770
devouring the pulse
of the city.

52:10.772 --> 52:12.605
Electrifying.

52:12.607 --> 52:15.575
I miss it very much.

52:15.577 --> 52:17.076
Did your father
give you a choice

52:17.078 --> 52:18.711
when it came time
to leave?

52:18.713 --> 52:20.880
My dad says I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

52:20.882 --> 52:24.217
We're not strangers, Lachlan.

52:24.219 --> 52:26.919
We're going to be
great friends.

52:26.921 --> 52:28.287
Here we are.

52:31.392 --> 52:33.292
What's so special
about a hallway?

52:33.294 --> 52:35.361
(knocks)

52:46.241 --> 52:48.307
(electronic beeping)

53:21.776 --> 53:24.310
Holden, we have a guest.

53:24.312 --> 53:25.845
Where are your
manners, angel?

53:27.782 --> 53:29.849
Hello. Want to play?

53:49.337 --> 53:50.703
(elevator bell dings)

53:53.975 --> 53:55.174
IRIS:
Did you hear?

53:55.176 --> 53:57.143
They sold the hotel.

53:57.145 --> 53:58.344
We'll be cast to the wind.

53:58.346 --> 54:00.213
Consider it a blessing, Mother.

54:00.215 --> 54:02.315
You should have left
this place years ago.

54:02.317 --> 54:04.850
I'm here because
I need to see you

54:04.852 --> 54:07.053
every day.

54:07.055 --> 54:08.621
Time for you to let go.

54:15.363 --> 54:16.662
(over radio):
¶ When you're alone ¶

54:16.664 --> 54:19.332
¶ And life is making you
lonely ¶

54:19.334 --> 54:22.068
¶ You can always go ¶

54:22.070 --> 54:23.903
¶ Downtown ¶

54:23.905 --> 54:25.204
¶ When you've got worries ¶

54:25.206 --> 54:26.706
¶ All the noise and the hurry ¶

54:26.708 --> 54:30.176
¶ Seems to help, I know ¶

54:30.178 --> 54:31.844
¶ Downtown ¶

54:31.846 --> 54:33.546
¶ Just listen to the music ¶

54:33.548 --> 54:35.581
¶ Of the traffic
in the city... ¶

54:57.739 --> 55:00.273
¶ ¶

55:05.580 --> 55:07.246
IRIS:
Can you tell me

55:07.248 --> 55:08.381
what room they're in?

55:08.383 --> 55:09.548
The couple that
just came in?

55:09.550 --> 55:11.217
I'm sorry, lady.

55:11.219 --> 55:12.785
This is a no-tell motel.

55:12.787 --> 55:16.222
That boy is... is my son

55:16.224 --> 55:18.457
and that junkie's
about to give him dope.

55:20.094 --> 55:21.661
(quietly):
Christ...

55:24.065 --> 55:25.331
Here.

55:27.268 --> 55:29.735
Oh, come on.

55:29.737 --> 55:30.936
Where's the nearest ATM?

55:30.938 --> 55:32.738
At the corner drugstore,

55:32.740 --> 55:34.573
right next to the maxi pads.

55:34.575 --> 55:35.841
(sighs)

55:41.582 --> 55:44.016
Goddamn it.

55:44.952 --> 55:46.552
Come on.

55:49.757 --> 55:51.590
(sniffs)

55:51.592 --> 55:52.958
There we go.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.795
(sniffs)

55:55.797 --> 55:57.697
Ah...

56:01.769 --> 56:03.836
(laughs)

56:10.678 --> 56:12.511
You're gonna give me
a fresh needle, right?

56:12.513 --> 56:15.348
I'm the cleanest person
you know.

56:46.214 --> 56:47.546
(quiet, breathy laugh)
(pounding at door)

56:57.158 --> 56:58.457
(kissing sound)

56:59.994 --> 57:01.394
(pounding continues)

57:07.835 --> 57:09.168
Yeah?

57:09.170 --> 57:10.469
(pounding continues)

57:11.839 --> 57:13.906
What'd you give him?

57:13.908 --> 57:16.041
Donovan?

57:16.043 --> 57:17.743
He's out cold.

57:17.745 --> 57:19.745
Who invited you in, lady?

57:19.747 --> 57:21.080
What did you give him?!

57:21.082 --> 57:22.581
China White.

57:22.583 --> 57:24.750
Which means he is just
where he wants to be.

57:24.752 --> 57:27.253
Call 911!
No one's calling anyone.

57:27.255 --> 57:29.555
Come on...
I told him not to try
and keep up with me.

57:29.557 --> 57:31.190
We took the same shit

57:31.192 --> 57:32.558
and I am more
than fine.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.860
At least until you barged in.

57:34.862 --> 57:36.395
You can't leave!

57:36.397 --> 57:38.030
Oh, please.

57:38.032 --> 57:39.932
You know how much
I paid for this dope?

57:39.934 --> 57:41.267
IRIS:
Come on...

57:41.269 --> 57:43.269
(crying):
Oh, God.

57:43.271 --> 57:45.404
Oh, God...

57:45.406 --> 57:47.540
Oh, God...

57:47.542 --> 57:48.607
(door shuts)

57:50.044 --> 57:53.946
(humming quietly)

57:57.718 --> 58:00.186
¶ ¶

58:21.976 --> 58:23.809
(approaching footsteps)

58:25.112 --> 58:27.680
(screaming)

58:30.251 --> 58:32.685
(coughs)

58:37.258 --> 58:39.692
("Hotel California" begins)

59:08.356 --> 59:09.855
Who are you?

59:12.193 --> 59:16.362
Your boy has a jawline for days.

59:18.833 --> 59:21.367
¶ ¶

59:29.710 --> 59:32.978
¶ On a dark desert highway ¶

59:32.980 --> 59:36.148
¶ Cool wind in my hair ¶

59:36.150 --> 59:39.318
¶ Warm smell of colitas ¶

59:39.320 --> 59:42.321
¶ Rising up through the air ¶

59:42.323 --> 59:45.691
¶ Up ahead in the distance ¶

59:45.693 --> 59:48.894
¶ I saw a shimmering light ¶

59:48.896 --> 59:52.331
¶ My head grew heavy
and my sight grew dim ¶

59:52.333 --> 59:55.734
¶ I had to stop for the night ¶

59:55.736 --> 59:58.704
¶ There she stood
in the doorway ¶

59:58.706 --> 1:00:02.074
¶ I heard the mission bell ¶

1:00:02.076 --> 1:00:04.209
¶ And I was thinking to myself ¶

1:00:04.211 --> 1:00:05.844
¶ This could be heaven ¶

1:00:05.846 --> 1:00:08.514
¶ Or this could be hell ¶

1:00:08.516 --> 1:00:11.850
¶ Then she lit up her candle ¶

1:00:11.852 --> 1:00:15.187
¶ And she showed me the way ¶

1:00:15.189 --> 1:00:18.023
¶ There were voices
down the corridor ¶

1:00:18.025 --> 1:00:21.527
¶ Thought I heard them say ¶

1:00:21.529 --> 1:00:25.431
¶ Welcome
to the Hotel California ¶

1:00:27.368 --> 1:00:29.268
¶ Such a lovely place ¶

1:00:29.270 --> 1:00:30.769
¶<i> Such a lovely place</i> ¶

1:00:30.771 --> 1:00:34.373
¶ Such a lovely face ¶

1:00:34.375 --> 1:00:38.611
¶ They livin' it up
at the Hotel California ¶

1:00:40.548 --> 1:00:42.381
¶ What a nice surprise ¶

1:00:42.383 --> 1:00:44.216
¶<i> What a nice surprise</i> ¶

1:00:44.218 --> 1:00:47.052
¶ Bring your alibis ¶

1:00:47.054 --> 1:00:51.056
¶ Mirrors on the ceiling ¶

1:00:51.058 --> 1:00:53.392
¶ The pink champagne on ice ¶

1:00:53.394 --> 1:00:57.396
¶ And she said, we are all
just prisoners here ¶

1:00:57.398 --> 1:01:00.466
¶ Of our own device ¶

1:01:00.468 --> 1:01:03.902
¶ And in the master's chambers ¶

1:01:03.904 --> 1:01:06.939
¶ They gathered for the feast ¶

1:01:06.941 --> 1:01:09.408
¶ They stab it
with their steely knives ¶

1:01:09.410 --> 1:01:13.579
¶ But they just can't
kill the beast ¶

1:01:13.581 --> 1:01:16.315
¶ Last thing I remember ¶

1:01:16.317 --> 1:01:19.018
¶ I was running for the door ¶

1:01:20.921 --> 1:01:22.955
¶ I had to find
the passage back ¶

1:01:22.957 --> 1:01:26.959
¶ To the place I was before ¶

1:01:26.961 --> 1:01:29.161
¶ Relax, said the night man ¶

1:01:29.163 --> 1:01:33.298
¶ We are programmed to receive ¶

1:01:33.300 --> 1:01:35.768
¶ You can check out
any time you like ¶

1:01:35.770 --> 1:01:37.503
¶ But you can never leave... ¶
