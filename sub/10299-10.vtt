<i>We'll be right back</i>

01:19.467 --> 01:24.334
<i>with more on Dateless Dude
Late Night Theater.</i>

01:27.701 --> 01:30.734
<i>Do you like to be spanked?</i>

01:31.734 --> 01:33.966
<i>Well, I'm looking
for some naughty boys</i>

01:34.000 --> 01:36.400
<i>who need my special brand
of discipline.</i>

01:36.434 --> 01:39.834

you see on the screen.</i>

01:39.868 --> 01:41.200
<i>And remember, kids,</i>

01:41.234 --> 01:44.667
<i>be sure to ask
your parents' permission.</i>

01:46.701 --> 01:48.368
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:54.067 --> 01:56.066
Hello?

01:56.100 --> 01:59.067
Yes, I-I've been bad.

02:01.033 --> 02:03.333
Do what?

02:03.367 --> 02:06.267
Well, if I have to.

02:19.634 --> 02:22.301
Pretty cool, Bud.

02:27.667 --> 02:31.267
Uh...that was
Buck's mother.

02:33.334 --> 02:36.133
Well, he didn't wanna
talk to her so I just...

02:36.167 --> 02:38.300
Yeah, save it
for the psychiatrist, Bud.

02:38.334 --> 02:40.600
Now, why don't you
just go on upstairs

02:40.634 --> 02:42.966
andNick-at-Nite
yourself to sleep?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.267
I need use
of the couch.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.900
I was here first.

02:49.934 --> 02:52.266
And besides, last time
you and a victim used the couch,

02:52.300 --> 02:53.800
we had to de-flea it.

02:55.434 --> 02:57.767
Or have you forgotten
about the Lester incident?

02:57.801 --> 03:02.867
Hey, I got a brother
named Lester.

03:04.734 --> 03:06.500
Do you?

03:09.067 --> 03:11.433
Look, Kel...

03:11.467 --> 03:13.099
why should you
be stuck downstairs?

03:13.133 --> 03:15.166
You're 18.
You can do what you want.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.733
I mean, you don't have to use
the sofa

03:16.767 --> 03:18.366
or the back seat of a car.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.066
Or that dirty pile of laundry

03:20.100 --> 03:22.600
you used last night
with Mongo.

03:22.634 --> 03:24.567
No.

03:24.601 --> 03:29.401
I got a brother
named Mongo.

03:30.467 --> 03:31.700
You're right.

03:31.734 --> 03:33.266
I am an adult.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.500
I mean, why am I sneaking boys
in the house?

03:35.534 --> 03:38.266
I'm not 12 anymore.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.500
Come on, let's go upstairs

03:39.534 --> 03:41.200
and play Strip Nintendo
like adults.

03:41.234 --> 03:42.734
All right.

03:48.934 --> 03:50.066
Oh, hi, Daddy.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.834
I'm 18, and I can do
whatever I want.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.200
This is Jake.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.400
Hi. We're goin'
to Kelly's room.

03:55.434 --> 03:57.067
Hold my calls.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.533
Hi, Jake. Uh, I'm sorry
Kelly didn't introduce us.

04:09.567 --> 04:11.233
But before you go
to the room,

04:11.267 --> 04:13.333
let me, uh, introduce you
to the rest of the house.

04:13.367 --> 04:16.266
This is the end
of the banister.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.368
Oh, and, uh, meet my wall.

04:20.033 --> 04:22.500
Now, what's that, Jake?
You say, "How do you get out?"

04:22.534 --> 04:23.867
Well, how 'bout the door?

04:23.901 --> 04:25.500
No, please don't.

04:25.534 --> 04:27.267
Oh, don't worry about it.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.067
Don't be a stranger.

04:49.167 --> 04:50.733
Gee, Bud,
judging by where he landed,

04:50.767 --> 04:52.133
I'd say
I'm about 8, 10 inches

04:52.167 --> 04:54.934
from my record toss
of 20 feet.

04:54.968 --> 04:56.133
I believe that was,
uh...

04:56.167 --> 04:57.233
Uh, Larry.

04:57.267 --> 05:00.067
Hey, I got a brother
named Larry.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.567
Daddy,
we have to talk.

05:04.601 --> 05:06.767
I'm 18,
and I have my rights.

05:06.801 --> 05:08.934
Believe her, Dad.
She's heard them plenty enough.

05:08.968 --> 05:10.433
She has the right
to remain silent,

05:10.467 --> 05:11.800
the right
to an attorney...

05:11.834 --> 05:13.667
Don't you have to get
on your hands and knees

05:13.701 --> 05:15.234
and call somebody?

05:18.501 --> 05:20.667
Come on, Daddy.
Why can't I do what I want?

05:20.701 --> 05:25.633
Al, honey,
I need my tushy rubbed.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.567
You see what can happen

05:27.601 --> 05:29.400
when you sneak
into somebody's bedroom

05:29.434 --> 05:30.700
before you're married?

05:30.734 --> 05:32.934
Well, I want my rights
in this house.

05:32.968 --> 05:34.400
And I am gonna hold my breath

05:34.434 --> 05:37.800
until you understand
that I am an adult.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.900
I'm holding it.

05:42.934 --> 05:45.467
I am not breathing.

05:45.501 --> 05:48.233
I'm really serious
this time.

05:48.267 --> 05:51.467
I think I'm blacking out.

05:51.501 --> 05:53.133
There, I've done it.
I've blacked out.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.667
Are you happy now?

05:56.934 --> 05:58.400
She may need
mouth-to-mouth, Dad.

05:58.434 --> 06:01.101
Should I call
some street-corner bums?

06:02.300 --> 06:04.166
It is just those kind
of inseminations

06:04.200 --> 06:07.767
that make Daddy think
I'm a bad girl.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.101
Oops, I breathed.

06:10.968 --> 06:12.433
God, this is hard.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.999
How do those guys
on submarines

06:14.033 --> 06:17.067
hold their breath
for so long?

06:18.033 --> 06:20.034
Uh, pumpkin...

06:20.434 --> 06:22.233
in order
for a house to be a home,

06:22.267 --> 06:24.366
only one can make the rules.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.600
And in this house,
those rules...

06:29.501 --> 06:32.567
...are made by the man.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.099
Daddy, if you won't listen
to reason,

06:35.133 --> 06:37.733
then I am just gonna have to get
my own place to live.

06:37.767 --> 06:40.667
Sweetheart,
threats don't work on me.

06:40.701 --> 06:45.067
No one's rubbing my tush!

06:47.200 --> 06:52.101
You see, I've already
been to hell.

06:58.567 --> 07:00.099
She's leavin', Al.

07:00.133 --> 07:02.233
Do you know
what that means?

07:02.267 --> 07:04.099
It means we're old.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.733
Old, Al.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.233
It's not so hard for you.

07:07.267 --> 07:10.066
You've been old.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.033
I just never thought
this would happen to me.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.900
Here it comes.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.066
Am I getting old?

07:17.100 --> 07:20.633
How would I know?
I never look at you.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.366
Well, Dad...

07:25.400 --> 07:31.033
I guess
this is au revoir.

07:31.067 --> 07:32.233
Mom...

07:32.267 --> 07:34.066
Adidas.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.233
Oh.

07:36.267 --> 07:38.934
All right now, there,
missy.

07:38.968 --> 07:42.033
I think we've played this
charade a little bit too long.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.633
Now, you don't fool me
for one minute,

07:43.667 --> 07:44.999
but look at your mother.

07:45.033 --> 07:46.266
You got her so worried,

07:46.300 --> 07:49.366
she's looking
every bit her 50 years.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.200
I'm sorry, Daddy,

07:51.234 --> 07:53.166
but if you won't respect me
as an adult,

07:53.200 --> 07:56.734
I have no choice
but to be my own mistress.

07:58.033 --> 08:00.533
Hey, what do you mean, 50?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.066
Where'd you get 50?

08:02.100 --> 08:05.867
Well, 'cause 100 was taken
by your mother.

08:05.901 --> 08:06.966
Now...

08:07.000 --> 08:11.133
pumpkin, let me explain
something to you.

08:11.167 --> 08:14.500
Don't be fooled
by Couchise over here.

08:14.534 --> 08:15.767
In the real world,

08:15.801 --> 08:17.867
you can't find a place to live
without money.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.200
I have money.

08:19.234 --> 08:21.867
Two hundred
and forty-six dollars.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.433
She's leaving, Al.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.300
Say something to her.

08:25.334 --> 08:28.966
Pumpkin, could you loan
your old dad a couple of bucks?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.567
There's this new
bowling ball I want.

08:30.601 --> 08:32.232
You know,
blue with a swirl?

08:32.267 --> 08:35.967
It's only $80.
You know I'm good for it.

08:38.033 --> 08:39.567
Goodbye, Mom.

08:39.601 --> 08:41.600
Oh!

08:41.634 --> 08:43.866
She's gone.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.900
Al, our baby's gone.

08:45.934 --> 08:47.467
Hold me.

08:47.501 --> 08:50.333
Well, I didn't hold you when we
conceived her. Why start now?

08:50.367 --> 08:53.234
Oh, Al.

08:56.267 --> 09:00.099
There, there, old one.
There, there.

09:00.133 --> 09:03.800
Al, I'm really
gettin' worried.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.366
Kelly promised
that she'd call.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.300
And it's been
six hours.

09:08.334 --> 09:10.800
A- and yet you were okay
when she used to go to drive-ins

09:10.834 --> 09:14.334
in a van that read
"Virgin Sacrifice Tour '90."

09:15.734 --> 09:17.834
You know, not everybody
in ripped jeans,

09:17.868 --> 09:19.600
no underwear
and a black hood

09:19.634 --> 09:21.867
is a bad influence,
honey.

09:21.901 --> 09:23.800
Go away, Peg.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.033
Al, was I
a good mother?

09:26.067 --> 09:28.600
You're not even
a good smoke.

09:28.767 --> 09:29.934
Oh, Bud,

09:29.968 --> 09:31.066
my son,

09:31.100 --> 09:32.366
where are you going?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.266
Honey,
don't forget a jacket, heh.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.233
Mom, it's
80 degrees outside.

09:36.267 --> 09:37.233
Come here.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.467
Let me feel your head.

09:39.501 --> 09:42.567
Gee, it's kind of lumpy,
heh.

09:44.167 --> 09:47.134
I-- I never
noticed that before.

09:47.734 --> 09:50.533
Bud, was I
a good mother?

09:50.567 --> 09:52.500
Well, you must
have been.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.133
I was the only
8- month-old baby

09:54.167 --> 09:56.166
who knew how to change
his own diaper.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.133
Well, I wish you
would have said something.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.533
Anyhow, from now on,

10:02.567 --> 10:04.400
I am really gonna be
a great mom.

10:04.434 --> 10:07.633
You'll see.
We'll be just like pals.

10:09.968 --> 10:12.133
* Hush, little baby *

10:12.167 --> 10:14.834
* Don't you cry *

10:14.868 --> 10:20.900
* Mama's gonna give you
A pizza pie *

10:20.934 --> 10:22.200
Uh, Dad?

10:22.234 --> 10:23.700
Oh, yeah.

10:23.734 --> 10:25.900
Yeah, I didn't see you
rushin' and helpin' me

10:25.934 --> 10:30.234
when I was rubbin' her butt,
lo, those many years.

10:32.167 --> 10:34.767
There's a 10-spot
in it for you, Dad.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.900
Oh, all right.

10:37.934 --> 10:39.533
Peg...

10:39.567 --> 10:41.767
Leave the boy go.

10:41.801 --> 10:45.767
But I need someone
to hug.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.700
You're on your own, son.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.300
I'll get it.

10:51.334 --> 10:53.800
Oh, my baby.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.434
Oh.
Mom, I'm warning you.

10:59.234 --> 11:00.300
Hello?

11:00.334 --> 11:01.834
Hi, Kelly.

11:01.868 --> 11:03.266
Okay, yeah,
I'll tell them.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.467
Bye.

11:05.501 --> 11:08.633
She got an apartment.

11:10.634 --> 11:15.867
* And if that pizza pie
Don't sing *

11:15.901 --> 11:22.434
* Mama's gonna buy you
A chicken wing *

11:31.734 --> 11:33.900
My little baby.

11:33.934 --> 11:38.934
Just a little, wittle,
wuddle, luddle man.

11:38.968 --> 11:40.733
Open the hangar.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.734
Here it comes.

11:49.133 --> 11:51.400
Help me.

11:51.434 --> 11:52.966
What are you
complainin' about?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.800
At least you're eatin'.

11:54.834 --> 11:58.133
You'll never leave
your mommy, will you?

11:58.167 --> 12:00.266
Why would I go out
with a girl my age,

12:00.300 --> 12:01.266
when I can stay home

12:01.300 --> 12:02.500
and be oiled
and powdered

12:02.534 --> 12:04.667
by my insane mother?

12:04.701 --> 12:09.733
Oh, Al, what will I do
when he's too big to cuddle?

12:09.767 --> 12:12.166
That's it.
That does it for me.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.533
If you need me,
I'll be upstairs

12:13.567 --> 12:15.567
writing
my soon-to-be-published...

12:15.601 --> 12:18.267
<i>How to Stay Cool
While Mommy Watches You Tinkle.</i>

12:19.567 --> 12:21.700
Pookie, can we talk?

12:21.734 --> 12:25.500
Oh, sure. I just have
to mash 'nanas for Bud's lunch.

12:26.868 --> 12:28.567
Well, I didn't
wanna interrupt you

12:28.601 --> 12:31.567
while you were, um,
emasculating our son,

12:31.601 --> 12:34.633
but, uh, Peg,
I suspect your mind,

12:34.667 --> 12:37.700
uh, much like the lost
continent of Atlantis,

12:37.734 --> 12:40.834
no longer appears
on any map.

12:40.868 --> 12:44.867
You know, Al,
kids grow up so darn fast.

12:44.901 --> 12:46.734
Let's have another baby.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.600
Gee, Peg,
there's a couple of things

12:49.634 --> 12:51.366
I'd rather do first.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.867
Uh, I'd rather dive
off the Sears Tower

12:53.901 --> 12:58.001
headfirst
into a thumbtack.

12:59.467 --> 13:01.733
Or I'd rather
bait a crocodile

13:01.767 --> 13:04.567
with my manhood.

13:04.601 --> 13:08.667
Which, I believe,
is what got me into this mess.

13:08.701 --> 13:10.733
Oh, wait a minute.
I-- But I forgot.

13:10.767 --> 13:12.633
You're as loony
as a tune.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.400
So of course,
we can have another child.

13:14.434 --> 13:15.400
Oh, look,

13:15.434 --> 13:16.800
here comes
our baby now.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.433
Let's call him
Insane-O.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.400
The product
of our love.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.500
You don't even miss Kelly,
do you?

13:23.534 --> 13:25.433
Nope.

13:25.467 --> 13:27.966
You are an unfeeling brute.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.266
I must bathe my boy.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.433
Oh, Bud?

13:31.467 --> 13:33.033
Here comes Mommy.

13:33.067 --> 13:38.401
Get out the ducky sponge.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
I'm not
an unfeeling brute.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.200
She's 18.
She oughta be gone.

13:57.234 --> 13:59.300
If I didn't get to lick
the mashed 'nana bowl,

13:59.334 --> 14:01.368
I'd be gone too.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.366
<i>parents who just don't
give a damn</i>

14:05.400 --> 14:06.900
<i>and grew old and depressed</i>

14:06.934 --> 14:10.101
<i>because their children
left and won't talk to them.</i>

14:10.834 --> 14:11.966
<i>Daddy, can I have</i>

14:12.000 --> 14:13.500
<i>a Buddy Burger?</i>

14:13.534 --> 14:15.533
<i>No, honey, you've had
too many already.</i>

14:15.567 --> 14:16.667
<i>Then I hate you,</i>

14:16.701 --> 14:18.999
<i>and I'm running away
forever.</i>

14:19.033 --> 14:20.667
<i>Bonnie did run away,</i>

14:20.701 --> 14:24.033
<i>into the path
of a speeding truck.</i>

14:24.067 --> 14:26.300
<i>The moral is, have us
scrape one off the grill</i>

14:26.334 --> 14:30.567
<i>so you don't have to scrape one
off the street.</i>

14:34.334 --> 14:36.099
<i>* Buddy Buddy
Buddy Burgers *</i>

14:36.133 --> 14:37.366
<i>* Made with love *</i>

14:37.400 --> 14:40.434
<i>And lard!</i>

14:47.868 --> 14:49.066
Excuse me, Al.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.434
I'd like you to meet
my new boyfriend, Sam.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.533
Al...

14:54.567 --> 14:56.433
tell Sam what
you do for a living.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.266
Well, I...

14:58.300 --> 15:00.134
I sell shoes.

15:04.334 --> 15:06.200
And how long
have you been doing this?

15:06.234 --> 15:08.301
Twenty years.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.834
And finally, exactly how old
are the socks

15:13.868 --> 15:16.001
you're wearing
on your feet?

15:16.601 --> 15:20.267
Not quite as old
as the hair on your legs.

15:26.601 --> 15:27.934
I'm glad you're here, Marce.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.200
I have to talk to you.

15:29.234 --> 15:31.934
Uh, you know Kelly,
don't you?

15:31.968 --> 15:33.266
Blond, pretty.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.934
Her boyfriends
sometimes climb

15:34.968 --> 15:37.234
into my room
by mistake?

15:37.934 --> 15:39.567
Yes, believe I know
the young lady.

15:39.601 --> 15:43.166
Well,
if she had $246,

15:43.200 --> 15:44.166
she could find a--

15:44.200 --> 15:45.999
A nice place to live,
couldn't she?

15:46.033 --> 15:48.800
Two hundred
and forty-six dollars?

15:48.834 --> 15:50.733
Well, with money like that
to throw around,

15:50.767 --> 15:52.467
you gotta figure
she's either living

15:52.501 --> 15:55.400
in a Big Gulp cup...

15:55.434 --> 15:59.066
or she's sellin'
her body for Pez.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.266
Why do you ask?

16:00.300 --> 16:02.233
Well,
she moved out.

16:02.267 --> 16:03.567
Think I should
go get her?

16:03.601 --> 16:05.066
Absolutely not.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.533
Now, this is
Kelly's first step

16:06.567 --> 16:08.033
towards independence.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.500
I mean, even if she's starving
and freezing to death

16:10.534 --> 16:12.533
and setting a rat
on fire for heat,

16:12.567 --> 16:14.467
she's still
better off.

16:14.501 --> 16:16.333
I mean, if you go
and rescue her,

16:16.367 --> 16:17.800
you are only
going to reinforce

16:17.834 --> 16:18.999
the traditional role

16:19.033 --> 16:21.533
of female subservience
to men.

16:21.567 --> 16:24.934
And it's something
I find personally odious.

16:24.968 --> 16:26.934
Let's see some knee, babe.

16:32.434 --> 16:33.633
So don't worry.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.500
It may not be
and easy road, but--

16:35.534 --> 16:37.633
Stop that,
you scamp.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.133
But I think Kelly
is perfectly capable

16:41.167 --> 16:42.934
of surviving
on her own.

16:42.968 --> 16:47.067
<i>On her own. On her own.
On her own.</i>

16:51.834 --> 16:56.999
<i>* You're the end
Of the rainbow *</i>

16:57.033 --> 17:03.667
<i>* My pot of gold *</i>

17:03.701 --> 17:09.165
<i>* You're Daddy's
Little girl *</i>

17:09.200 --> 17:14.333
<i>* To have and hold *</i>

17:14.367 --> 17:20.066
<i>* A precious gem *</i>

17:20.099 --> 17:23.900
<i>* Is what you are *</i>

17:23.934 --> 17:26.133
<i>* And you're *</i>

17:26.166 --> 17:30.233
<i>* Daddy's *</i>

17:30.267 --> 17:35.667
<i>* Little girl *</i>

17:35.701 --> 17:41.233
<i>* And you're Daddy's *</i>

17:41.267 --> 17:45.567
<i>* Little girl *</i>

17:49.467 --> 17:51.733
So all I'm trying
to say here is,

17:51.767 --> 17:53.066
with a little luck,

17:53.100 --> 17:54.400
Kelly will
turn out to be

17:54.434 --> 17:56.366
as strong
and independent

17:56.400 --> 17:58.600
as the woman you see
before you.

17:58.634 --> 18:00.800
Give me some lip,
baby.

18:06.934 --> 18:08.734
I'm coming,
pumpkin!

18:23.934 --> 18:24.900
Daddy.

18:24.934 --> 18:26.433
Hi, pumpkin.

18:26.467 --> 18:28.266
I came to see
how you're doin'.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.967
Well, come in.

18:31.234 --> 18:33.201
I, uh...

18:33.701 --> 18:36.334
I brought you somethin'.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.433
Pez?

18:38.467 --> 18:41.133
Yeah, I-I-I-- You know,
I didn't want you to have to...

18:41.167 --> 18:43.633
You know,
do anything for 'em.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.966
Hey, this is some place.
This is--

18:47.000 --> 18:48.934
Wow, a TV.

18:48.968 --> 18:50.800
Is that a cable box?
Mm-hm.

18:50.834 --> 18:53.433
Wow.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.400
Gee, what's blowin'
on my neck?

18:55.434 --> 18:57.099
It's the air conditioning,
Daddy.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.934
Ohhh.

18:59.968 --> 19:02.066
Well, what else
you got here?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.867
Nice.

19:10.200 --> 19:14.067
Great Caesar's ghost!

19:17.734 --> 19:19.700
You were worried about me,
weren't you, Daddy?

19:19.734 --> 19:22.301
Move over, Kelly.

19:23.133 --> 19:27.033
You know, I'm really sorry--
Mustard.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.967
I wanted to call--
Knife.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.633
Mmmm.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.167
Mm.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.733
Uh, Kelly...

19:39.767 --> 19:43.366
how do you afford
a place like this on only $246?

19:43.400 --> 19:45.300
Well, I'm kind of sharing
the place.

19:45.334 --> 19:46.467
My roommate takes care

19:46.501 --> 19:48.500
of most of the bills.

19:49.601 --> 19:51.433
Honey, I'm here.

19:51.467 --> 19:54.434
Mm, don't you look nice.

19:54.934 --> 19:56.600
And, uh, who are you?

19:56.634 --> 19:58.967
Oh, I'm the guy
that did this.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.900
Daddy,
you don't understand.

20:01.934 --> 20:02.900
Oh, I understand.

20:02.934 --> 20:05.133
Old guy, young girl,
fancy apartment,

20:05.167 --> 20:07.366
cold cuts
like there's no tomorrow.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.733
I know what's goin' on.

20:08.767 --> 20:12.368
I'm so upset, I can
hardly eat this sandwich!

20:13.701 --> 20:14.700
Daddy,

20:14.734 --> 20:16.333
what happened?

20:16.367 --> 20:18.300
Dad, meet Brooke.

20:18.334 --> 20:19.800
My roommate.

20:19.834 --> 20:23.266
You killed my Daddy!

20:23.300 --> 20:24.966
You mean,
you're not havin' an affair

20:25.000 --> 20:27.400
with my daughter?

20:27.434 --> 20:30.099
Of course not.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.667
You really do care,
don't you?

20:31.701 --> 20:33.867
Well, sure, I do.

20:33.901 --> 20:37.233
You're my little girl.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.468
Uh, I think
he's swallowing his tongue.

20:40.868 --> 20:41.966
You know,
pumpkin,

20:42.000 --> 20:42.966
maybe we can bend

20:43.000 --> 20:44.500
a few of those old rules,

20:44.534 --> 20:45.934
if you come home.

20:45.968 --> 20:48.500
Can I have boys
in my room?

20:48.534 --> 20:52.667
Well, let's take that
on a case-by-case basis.

21:00.434 --> 21:04.800
Well, obviously, neutering
doesn't do a damn thing.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.266
Hi, Kel.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.500
Um, I was just scaring off
the cat

21:11.534 --> 21:13.567
that keeps calling here.

21:13.601 --> 21:16.767
Bud, either get a girl
or get a collar.

21:16.801 --> 21:19.400
Well, I guess you two
will be needing the couch.

21:19.434 --> 21:21.233
Oh, Jake,
on your way out,

21:21.267 --> 21:23.934
check out our file
of free clinics nearby.

21:23.968 --> 21:26.099
Thanks, dog boy.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.900
Well, we won't
be needing the couch.

21:27.934 --> 21:29.366
Dad and I have
an agreement.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.800
We're going to my room.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.966
Are you sure?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.433
My left eye still wanders
from the last time.

21:35.467 --> 21:36.467
Oh,
don't worry.

21:36.501 --> 21:39.034
Daddy is just
a big, old teddy bear.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.099
Hi, Daddy.
We're going to my room,

21:42.133 --> 21:44.166
as per our agreement.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.967
Hi, Mr. Bundy. Remember me?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.099
So long, Jake.

22:17.133 --> 22:19.368
So long, Al.

22:23.934 --> 22:27.334
I do believe
that's a record.
