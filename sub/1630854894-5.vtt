00:38.789 --> 00:40.249
Can you explain me, please?

00:40.958 --> 00:42.000
What are you doing?

01:11.280 --> 01:12.739
Hey, hey, hey.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.199
Are you crazy?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.047
No, no, no!

01:29.047 --> 01:30.465
No, No.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.509
Move.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.386
<i>We found the panic room in the basement.</i>

05:18.819 --> 05:21.655
<i>Brian, we found
the panic room in the basement.</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:24.700
- Brian.
- Copy that. Understood.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.964
<i>Brian, what's up with you? Brian?</i>

05:38.964 --> 05:40.549
West clear.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.850
<i>Foxtrot Bravo, do you read me?</i>

06:32.476 --> 06:34.561
<i>What the hell is that?
I heard an explosion. What's going on?</i>

07:17.563 --> 07:19.481
Dad. Dad.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.298
Take the N48.

09:08.799 --> 09:09.967
I know the way.

09:12.845 --> 09:16.640
Listen, if I had really wanted to
kill him, he wouldn't be here right now.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.897
Here.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.482
They gave him this.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.193
I know he watched it.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.362
They're pressuring him.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.573
I heard him curse at them.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.035
I think he made a deal with them.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.121
So it's his fault now?

09:40.414 --> 09:43.750
You saw me trying to reason with him,
didn't you?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.509
I didn't have a choice.
It was either him or me.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.225
I had no choice.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.371
<i>I'm sick of all your lies.</i>

10:21.997 --> 10:24.416
<i>Get out. I don't want to see you anymore.</i>

10:24.416 --> 10:25.792
<i>Don't get mad.</i>

10:27.294 --> 10:29.421
<i>It's a bit late to find a hotel.
I'm staying the night.</i>

10:29.421 --> 10:31.548
<i>No, I don't want
Pierre to see you in the morning.</i>

10:31.548 --> 10:34.218
<i>I don't want him to know that
his own father can't stand him.</i>

10:35.761 --> 10:36.762
All right.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.264
How exactly do you see things now?

10:39.264 --> 10:41.642
- What things?
- Don't play dumb.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.146
Didier, if you think I'm going to give you
my EU passwords, you're delusional.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.815
You better watch it.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.568
You could end up in jail
after everything you've done, my dear.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.154
I'll report you too.
I'll tell them everything.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.989
Antropa, your dirty work, everything!

10:55.989 --> 10:59.493
<i>Except you don't have any proof,
and Antropa will squash you like a fly.</i>

10:59.493 --> 11:01.578
<i>It's too late.
You can't turn back now, my dear.</i>

11:05.415 --> 11:07.584
No. They're too far away.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.211
Do you prefer being called
"my stupid bitch"?

11:09.211 --> 11:12.214
You have no idea how powerful Antropa is
or who's behind it.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.550
- They've infiltrated the UK government.
- Didier! You have to understand!

11:14.550 --> 11:16.718
- I can't give you my passwords.
- What about Pierre?

11:16.718 --> 11:20.472
What will happen to him if you go to jail?
You think I'm going to take care of him?

11:21.390 --> 11:23.559
You will give your passwords to Antropa
when I tell you to!

11:23.559 --> 11:26.144
And since you don't want money,
you'll do it free of charge!

11:39.575 --> 11:41.368
Shit. Shit, he's gone.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.797
Make me a copy of that.
I'm going to destroy this fucker.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.048
Got it.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.401
Thank you.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.421
I have to admit,
your call surprised me, Commander.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.840
You know me?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.051
Don't try to be modest. You're a legend.

12:52.898 --> 12:53.982
Please.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.569
<i>You could end up in jail
after everything you've done, my dear.</i>

12:57.569 --> 12:59.571
<i>I'll report you too.
I'll tell them everything.</i>

12:59.571 --> 13:01.657
<i>Antropa, your dirty work, everything!</i>

13:01.657 --> 13:04.701
<i>Except you don't have any proof,
and Antropa will squash you like a fly.</i>

13:04.701 --> 13:07.204
<i>It's too late.
You can't turn back now, my dear.</i>

13:07.204 --> 13:08.455
Is that all?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.463
Let's face it, Dumas.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.924
The president doesn't like me.
I'm a woman.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.511
I refuse to sleep with anyone,
I'm a little too good at my job.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.805
If I show this to the president,

13:25.430 --> 13:27.015
Taraud will simply be
transferred elsewhere

13:27.015 --> 13:30.394
and will carry on doing his dirty work,
and I'll be fired in the next six months.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.521
Firstly, I don't want to lose my job.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.314
Secondly...

13:36.149 --> 13:37.609
I want his life to be over.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.112
Not just his career.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.283
We have one thing in common.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.662
Madame Saint Roch,

13:49.830 --> 13:52.040
I know that you don't really approve of
firms like Telkis.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.961
But know that I would have never
accepted this mission

13:55.961 --> 14:00.257
if I didn't really believe that Taraud
was working for the French government.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.849
What clearance level
does this Sabine Louseau have? Level 2?

14:09.808 --> 14:10.809
One?

14:10.809 --> 14:11.894
One.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.815
Her passwords give access to top-secret
documents protected in cyberspace.

14:16.815 --> 14:17.900
We verified it.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.447
So they're going to attack us
like they attacked the British.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.579
Excuse me.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.207
Yes, Gabriel, what is it?

14:33.207 --> 14:36.710
Yeah. Well, you were right about Antropa.
I recognized one of their men.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.170
So the plan worked?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.088
Samir is safe?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.758
Yes. Well,
I'm waiting for news from Rowdy.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.968
<i>Why would you care about that guy?</i>

14:44.968 --> 14:48.055
Why would I care? I care because
I don't want to be accused of murder.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.557
You understand?

14:50.557 --> 14:51.934
Ms. Rowdy?

14:52.643 --> 14:53.644
Ms. Rowdy.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.687
Oh, Gabriel, don't tell me
she's with you right now.

14:55.687 --> 14:59.066
- Gabriel, stop making a fool of yourself!
- Please come with me.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.984
I'm going on a boat. I'll call you back.

15:04.821 --> 15:05.906
Are you sure about him?

15:05.906 --> 15:07.115
Yes.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.245
Leave these videos with me.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.122
I'll keep in touch.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.905
Love you, Dad.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.571
<i>You have to
bring me back to London with Samir.</i>

16:27.571 --> 16:29.072
<i>It's my only option.</i>

16:30.657 --> 16:33.493
I have to prove that
Antropa is behind these attacks, or I'll--

16:34.161 --> 16:35.704
I'll be in big trouble, you understand?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.583
What if Samir wants to stay in France?

16:40.834 --> 16:44.463
Samir isn't the problem. It's you.
You want to help me or not?

16:45.631 --> 16:47.883
Well, it's a bit complicated, you know.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.594
What's complicated?

16:54.348 --> 16:55.724
I don't work for you.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.446
They're here?

17:11.323 --> 17:13.867
They think a boat will be safer
for the wife and baby.

17:20.499 --> 17:23.085
I need you. I really need you.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.712
Really?

17:28.089 --> 17:29.132
Come on.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.312
And Samir?

17:44.356 --> 17:45.649
They want to see you first.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.276
Come.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.157
Hello.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.456
Hello, Alison.

18:10.716 --> 18:11.717
So?

18:12.301 --> 18:13.719
Are you not happy to see us?

18:14.970 --> 18:17.764
I-- I didn't know
you had become fishermen.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.017
No, they're not fishermen.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.853
Not really.
You think the world's a better place now?

18:24.271 --> 18:27.858
So what is it? A yes, a no,
an "I don't know, I have no idea"?

18:29.443 --> 18:30.694
Because we don't think so.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.654
You see, we haven't changed.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.157
We keep on fighting. We won't stop.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.242
Unlike you.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.370
Look who you're working for.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.372
Come on.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.917
Are you going to give her shit all day?

18:45.501 --> 18:48.337
Gabriel,
how many times did she visit you in jail?

18:48.337 --> 18:50.797
And you, how many times
did you come visit me in jail?

18:51.924 --> 18:53.217
And you?

18:53.217 --> 18:54.343
Well then.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.054
After 20 years,
shouldn't we all forgive her?

18:57.638 --> 18:59.264
No friendship is supposed to be for life.

18:59.765 --> 19:03.727
You completely disappeared
after Nathalie's death. No news, nothing.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.187
None of you give a fuck about me.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.482
Obviously. To us, you were a daddy's girl.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.651
Nathalie was the one that liked you.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.903
She said you were generous.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.240
But not enough to share Gabriel.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.161
What's this fucking trial
you're putting her on?

19:24.081 --> 19:25.499
You wanted to see her, so I brought her.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.751
You've seen her. We're good, right?
Can we go on the boat now?

19:27.751 --> 19:30.003
You're right, we've seen enough of her.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.089
There you go.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.215
Let's go.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.304
We agreed to protect your guy
because he's Syrian and anti-Assad.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.348
And because Gabriel is our friend.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.267
We're not doing it for you.

19:44.518 --> 19:45.727
I know.

19:47.813 --> 19:49.106
Thank you.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.313
Welcome.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.780
We've managed to reconstruct
some of the conversation

20:38.780 --> 20:40.908
between Taraud and his mistress
from the video you gave us.

20:40.908 --> 20:42.034
Well, let's see it.

20:43.577 --> 20:46.163
<i>You will give your passwords
to Antropa when I tell you to!</i>

20:46.663 --> 20:49.082
<i>And since you don't want money,
you'll do it free of charge!</i>

20:51.668 --> 20:53.003
We verified the information.

20:53.003 --> 20:57.299
What Antropa wants is a secret list
from the European Cybersecurity Center.

20:57.966 --> 21:01.178
A list of flaws in the security systems
of the 27 EU countries.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.805
In some cases, the countries affected
weren't even told about their flaws.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.225
Or if they were, they didn't have
the power to do anything about it.

21:06.225 --> 21:10.229
So, with this list, Antropa could destroy
any part of our infrastructure?

21:10.229 --> 21:11.563
Yes, exactly.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.318
I'll prepare a report for the president.

21:17.611 --> 21:18.737
There's one more thing.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.616
<i>Stop it! Stop calling me that!</i>

21:22.616 --> 21:25.118
<i>Do you prefer being called
"my stupid bitch"?</i>

21:25.118 --> 21:27.913
<i>You have no idea how powerful
Antropa is or who's behind it.</i>

21:27.913 --> 21:30.791
- They've infiltrated the UK government.
- Didier! You have to understand!

21:35.212 --> 21:40.008
Well, it's clear that the Brits have
a mole in their own government.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.345
- We've got Taraud.
- Yes.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.056
Now I understand why Antropa
was investing so much money

21:46.056 --> 21:50.352
in new offices on the Thames in London
these past few months.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.436
It's clear.

21:52.396 --> 21:54.439
They knew from the beginning
that they'd win.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.068
I'll go see the president.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.711
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

22:15.711 --> 22:19.673
Dogs would learn faster, Toby.

22:20.591 --> 22:25.179
You cannot be putting
the national security of this country

22:25.179 --> 22:27.097
into the hands of private companies.

22:27.097 --> 22:29.391
We're not fucking socialists.

22:30.726 --> 22:33.395
Privatization works.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.940
You're a dinosaur, Richard.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.526
I am a dinosaur.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.949
And I'm ashamed.

22:49.203 --> 22:52.247
I'm ashamed
as to what this government has become.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.835
And what's worse? I saw it coming.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.754
The contracts with Antropa.

22:59.505 --> 23:00.881
Are they ready?

23:00.881 --> 23:04.635
Or should I tell the PM
you're handing in your resignation?

23:17.773 --> 23:18.941
Yeah, it's ready.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.779
You can tell the PM

23:25.405 --> 23:29.660
that, as of tomorrow, I'll be selling
this country to the highest bidder.

23:30.244 --> 23:31.537
Don't sulk, Richard.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.414
Make the call to Antropa right now.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.793
What counts is fixing the problem.
Doesn't matter how.

23:39.753 --> 23:40.796
Course.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.433
Mr. Taraud would like to--

23:53.433 --> 23:55.018
Are you fucking with me, Bob?

23:56.103 --> 23:58.814
I can't believe you.
You let Samir get away again?

23:59.731 --> 24:01.024
We won.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.402
The British are going to sign, Didier.

24:04.278 --> 24:05.946
Don't worry about Samir.

24:05.946 --> 24:08.991
I'm leaving for London tomorrow.
Everything's going to be over soon.

24:12.995 --> 24:14.872
What if he talks?
If he tells them everything he knows,

24:14.872 --> 24:17.332
the British government
will nullify the contract.

24:17.332 --> 24:18.959
You don't know the Brits.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.128
They'll never admit that we fucked them.

24:22.504 --> 24:25.465
They'll act like they asked us
to fuck them over.

24:28.552 --> 24:31.180
In any case,
it was good of you to try to help us.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.764
The boss appreciated it.

24:32.764 --> 24:36.185
I know. I just talked to him. He asked me
to fill you in on our plans, actually.

24:40.689 --> 24:41.857
What plans?

24:42.482 --> 24:44.902
Sorry, I sometimes forget that
you are only the director of operations.

24:44.902 --> 24:47.321
If I join Antropa as a board member,
it's not to twiddle my thumbs.

24:47.321 --> 24:49.907
It's to propose changes
and open new perspectives.

24:49.907 --> 24:53.118
And Miller has understood this clearly.
So he asked me to accompany you to London.

24:53.118 --> 24:56.079
Know why? Because I've found a way
to attack the EU countries.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.625
Thanks to me, Antropa will have
the whole of Europe under contract.

25:30.447 --> 25:31.740
There you are.

25:39.373 --> 25:41.416
- How are you?
- Good.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.210
Hello there.

25:44.628 --> 25:45.963
It's good to see you again.

25:48.465 --> 25:49.842
You haven't changed much.

25:51.927 --> 25:52.970
Neither have you.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.600
So, did everything go well?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.102
Yeah, no worries.

26:00.102 --> 26:02.813
Nobody saw them.
Nobody asked about them. Follow me.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.441
They're below deck, in the mess.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.028
Don't cry. Don't cry.

26:11.488 --> 26:12.698
Why are we leaving?

26:13.740 --> 26:15.576
We're happy in France.

26:15.576 --> 26:18.203
Gabriel said he could get us papers.

26:18.704 --> 26:20.622
We don't know anyone here.

26:21.206 --> 26:23.625
Alison can introduce us
to significant people in London.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.294
Do you believe that?

26:25.919 --> 26:28.964
To them, you're a terrorist.
You attacked their country.

26:28.964 --> 26:30.841
I didn't attack anybody.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.051
Myriam.

26:33.594 --> 26:34.678
Alison.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.766
- You okay?
- Yes.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.435
- The baby's okay?
- Yes, he is.

26:42.144 --> 26:43.228
Hello.

26:53.739 --> 26:55.115
Hello, gorgeous.

26:57.159 --> 26:58.702
What happened to Krimo?

27:00.037 --> 27:01.163
He escaped.

27:01.914 --> 27:03.248
He'll call you.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.709
Beautiful.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.461
So what do we do now?

27:08.879 --> 27:10.130
Open the USB drive

27:11.089 --> 27:12.424
and make us a copy.

27:32.194 --> 27:34.196
Here, this one has good signal.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.908
When are you leaving for England?

27:38.492 --> 27:39.660
We're waiting for the tide.

27:40.452 --> 27:44.498
There's a Greenpeace protest
at a new drilling site in Scotland.

27:49.461 --> 27:52.756
Seeing you reminds me of my sister.
You know, I think of Nathalie every day.

27:59.847 --> 28:01.139
I'll leave you guys to it.

28:29.251 --> 28:31.420
Those are all Antropa operations?

28:31.920 --> 28:35.048
- Even future attacks in the UK?
- You have everything.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.468
Walid and I hacked into their web servers.

28:39.595 --> 28:41.180
No one had ever done it before.

28:43.182 --> 28:45.350
So, you're the genius.

28:48.979 --> 28:50.397
Walid is very good too.

28:54.985 --> 28:57.654
All we wanted to do
was to destroy Assad's police files

28:57.654 --> 28:58.947
and then flee the country.

28:58.947 --> 29:01.116
And we found that Antropa
was supplying Assad,

29:01.116 --> 29:02.576
so we hacked them too.

29:04.286 --> 29:06.496
We had the idea of copying the files
to sell them.

29:07.873 --> 29:09.583
Why did you go to the French?

29:09.583 --> 29:11.376
We went to the British first.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.378
National Cyber Security Center.

29:14.129 --> 29:15.255
Mark Bolton.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.174
We even had an appointment with him.

29:17.883 --> 29:19.051
He didn't show up.

29:20.886 --> 29:22.721
Bolton was murdered by Antropa.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.230
I don't wanna go to London anymore.

29:31.939 --> 29:34.316
- Samir.
- No.

29:35.526 --> 29:37.152
I wanna stay in France.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.237
No.

29:38.237 --> 29:39.738
My wife is scared.

29:40.697 --> 29:41.990
- I'm scared.
- Samir.

29:42.533 --> 29:45.536
I work for the Home Office.
You and your wife will be safe.

29:46.537 --> 29:50.707
You--You'll have residency, jobs.
We'll provide complete protection.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.459
Trust me.

29:58.674 --> 29:59.883
I trust him.

30:02.594 --> 30:03.971
He'll be with us all the way.

30:04.596 --> 30:05.764
Right, Gabriel?

30:10.894 --> 30:12.813
We'll talk to the French.

30:13.897 --> 30:14.940
Okay?

30:16.775 --> 30:18.151
What did you say?

30:18.777 --> 30:20.070
I don't work for you.

30:24.825 --> 30:26.869
But if I don't come back with him,
I'm dead!

30:26.869 --> 30:30.330
Do you know what I'm risking here?
You can't do this to me.

30:30.914 --> 30:33.333
- Hello.
- We're almost there.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.879
<i>So tell Ms. Rowdy that we would like her
to be present. We want to talk to her.</i>

30:36.879 --> 30:38.255
Where are you?

30:38.255 --> 30:39.548
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>

30:43.594 --> 30:45.387
There are people who want to see you.

31:20.339 --> 31:21.757
Ms. Rowdy.

31:22.758 --> 31:24.092
Have a seat, please.

31:27.596 --> 31:29.139
So you're Delage?

31:34.228 --> 31:35.812
I suppose you know who I am.

31:36.396 --> 31:37.439
Of course.

31:37.981 --> 31:40.526
You can tell me whatever you want,
Ms. Rowdy.

31:40.526 --> 31:43.904
Samir Hamza is suspected of complicity
in a terrorist attack on London.

31:44.905 --> 31:46.114
We have to arrest him.

31:50.953 --> 31:52.120
Listen.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.831
If Samir stays in France,

31:54.831 --> 31:57.793
there will be more casualties
until we sign with Antropa.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.504
Is that what you want?
For us to sign with those bastards?

32:00.504 --> 32:02.548
Because it's a French company?

32:03.048 --> 32:04.341
On the contrary.

32:05.717 --> 32:07.094
We want to destroy them.

32:08.387 --> 32:09.763
Before they attack Europe.

32:11.390 --> 32:12.516
Prove it then.

32:13.225 --> 32:15.185
Tell Samir to come with me to London.

32:17.229 --> 32:18.605
With Gabriel.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.235
What do we get in return?

32:32.077 --> 32:33.328
A copy of the USB key.

32:35.873 --> 32:38.292
That's hardly enough, Ms. Rowdy.

32:39.209 --> 32:40.544
So what do you want?

32:40.544 --> 32:42.087
One of the president's advisers

32:42.087 --> 32:47.092
has a series of top-secret meetings
in London tomorrow,

32:47.843 --> 32:49.803
and the DGSE hasn't been invited.

32:50.470 --> 32:51.805
His name is Didier Taraud.

32:53.140 --> 32:55.184
And we think that
he's going to use this trip

32:55.184 --> 32:57.769
as cover for a secret meeting
with the CEO of Antropa.

32:59.354 --> 33:00.522
Who is he?

33:00.522 --> 33:02.816
Francis Miller. A Frenchman.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.527
But they also have an accomplice. A Brit.

33:06.945 --> 33:10.365
Someone close to the ministers
who has access to all the files.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.410
He's a professional.

33:15.162 --> 33:16.163
Like you.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.749
I'll go with them.

33:20.626 --> 33:23.003
You don't get to decide that, Delage.

33:24.296 --> 33:26.673
You can't arrest Samir in France.
He hasn't done anything.

33:27.508 --> 33:28.926
He even has a passport.

33:30.135 --> 33:33.138
The only question is: Are you going to
pay me to protect him or not?

33:35.390 --> 33:37.142
If I decide that Samir stays in France,

33:37.142 --> 33:39.394
I only need to make a phone call
and the boat goes nowhere.

33:39.394 --> 33:41.605
Madame Saint Roch,
everyone will lose in the end.

33:55.285 --> 33:57.037
Here's what we're going to do.

33:57.037 --> 34:01.917
I'll let you leave with Samir,
and Delage as a bodyguard,

34:03.085 --> 34:04.127
but you...

34:05.879 --> 34:07.756
You have to help us stop Taraud.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.885
I need to know everything he does
in London.

34:12.469 --> 34:14.012
Where he goes,

34:14.679 --> 34:17.474
who he meets, and what he talks about.

34:30.696 --> 34:31.780
Hello.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.364
<i>Did you watch the video tape?</i>

34:34.533 --> 34:35.742
<i>Not yet.</i>

34:36.534 --> 34:38.495
Well, call me when you've watched it.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.205
All right.

34:54.261 --> 34:58.098
If I don't have conclusive
evidence to give to the PM tomorrow,

34:58.098 --> 35:00.559
then not only will I be
signing with Antropa,

35:01.059 --> 35:03.395
you'll be charged with
colluding with a foreign agent.

35:04.104 --> 35:08.483
The only hope, the best hope
for both of us, Alison, is the Syrian.

35:09.318 --> 35:12.070
So if you've anything you need to tell me,
tell me now.

35:13.614 --> 35:16.158
I'll send you the GPS
of where we'll be landing.

35:19.328 --> 35:20.746
How many of you are there?

35:20.746 --> 35:23.165
- Four.
- Okay.

35:23.874 --> 35:25.125
We'll be there to meet you.

35:26.293 --> 35:27.336
Okay.

35:52.903 --> 35:54.780
Am I leaving you all by yourself?

35:55.906 --> 35:57.366
I'll be fine.

35:57.366 --> 35:59.368
Right now you need to be with your mother.

36:16.927 --> 36:18.470
All right. Bye, Dad. I'll call you.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.639
- I love you.
- I love you too.

36:35.279 --> 36:36.822
- Mr. Onwori?
- Hey.

36:37.614 --> 36:38.782
For Miss Rowdy.

36:39.408 --> 36:41.076
It'll never fit in the box.

36:41.076 --> 36:42.953
- Thank you.
- Have a good evening.

37:01.430 --> 37:06.518
"Dear Alison, if this ever gets to you,
it's probably because I am dead.

37:07.728 --> 37:09.855
Only person I trust completely.

37:11.023 --> 37:13.192
I was contacted by Antropa

37:14.735 --> 37:16.069
five years ago.

37:16.862 --> 37:19.781
Enclosed are copies
of the cryptocurrency accounts."

37:21.491 --> 37:22.492
This one.

37:25.704 --> 37:27.539
"You'll find her..."

37:31.001 --> 37:33.170
At least that moron Bolton
did one thing right.

37:33.921 --> 37:35.172
Alison's in the clear.

37:35.672 --> 37:37.966
Okay. I will send these to--

37:37.966 --> 37:39.343
And we'll deal with this.

37:43.138 --> 37:44.973
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Richard.

38:31.728 --> 38:32.729
Hey.

38:33.730 --> 38:34.773
Need any help?

38:39.611 --> 38:42.698
Don't cry, honey.
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

38:47.536 --> 38:48.829
Hey, don't cry. Don't cry.

39:10.184 --> 39:14.646
<i>...won't let them do what they want,
and if it wasn't him, it was Stibbard,</i>

39:14.646 --> 39:17.274
<i>if it wasn't Stibbard or him,
it was Monet...</i>

40:45.320 --> 40:46.822
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:46.822 --> 40:48.282
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

40:49.324 --> 40:50.909
I can make you some coffee if you want.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.202
No, thanks.

40:52.202 --> 40:53.620
How are the youngsters?

40:54.580 --> 40:55.831
I think they're sleeping.

41:28.405 --> 41:30.908
<i>Let's go, guys.
They're coming. They're coming.</i>

42:01.772 --> 42:03.732
- ...and Telkis.
- But that's superhuman.

42:07.945 --> 42:09.196
Isn't that Nathalie?

42:10.906 --> 42:12.032
Put it back on.

42:16.787 --> 42:17.913
Gaby, play it.

42:24.336 --> 42:25.879
- What are you playing at?
- There you go.

43:51.381 --> 43:53.050
It was you, you fucking bitch!

43:53.050 --> 43:55.677
Come here! You piece of shit.

43:57.638 --> 44:00.974
Come back here, bitch.
Come here. I'll kill you myself.

44:02.309 --> 44:05.354
You want some more, huh?
You're less of a show-off now!

44:07.648 --> 44:09.483
Take that! And that!

44:15.364 --> 44:16.532
Shut up!

44:17.491 --> 44:20.244
- I said, come back here.
- Let go of me! Let go!

44:22.955 --> 44:23.997
Myriam!

44:23.997 --> 44:25.082
Alison!

44:25.874 --> 44:27.668
- Alison!
- Go to your room!

44:27.668 --> 44:29.211
Go back to the room, Myriam!

44:30.254 --> 44:31.797
- Let me go.
- Stay back.

45:00.200 --> 45:02.369
Let's see how you feel about being burned.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.209
What are you doing?

45:09.209 --> 45:10.669
An eye for an eye.

45:11.753 --> 45:13.297
You know that.

45:16.341 --> 45:18.844
Annick. Oh, Annick.

45:28.395 --> 45:30.147
- What? What?
- Stop it. Stop, Gabriel.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.570
What if it was my fault?

45:36.570 --> 45:38.488
What if it's because of me?

45:38.488 --> 45:40.199
What's wrong with you?

45:40.199 --> 45:43.535
She killed Nathalie
and sent you to jail for fuck's sake!

45:43.535 --> 45:45.954
Jail? I've never set foot in jail. Never.

45:51.835 --> 45:53.670
I was working
for Military Intelligence. I--

45:55.380 --> 45:58.091
I infiltrated your group and sold you out.
You never suspected a thing.

46:00.969 --> 46:02.304
Not a thing.

46:05.140 --> 46:07.267
From the beginning,
I was only there to provoke you.

46:08.060 --> 46:09.811
So that you would all get arrested.

46:18.195 --> 46:20.239
But first, I had to get rid of you.

46:20.239 --> 46:21.782
Get rid of me?

46:22.407 --> 46:23.534
Because of your father.

46:25.077 --> 46:26.787
He was too high-ranked in NATO.

46:27.412 --> 46:29.790
A general can't have his daughter
hanging out with these radicals.

46:44.054 --> 46:45.556
Let's stop all this bullshit.

47:14.751 --> 47:16.170
Come on.

48:44.466 --> 48:45.676
Come on.

48:46.718 --> 48:47.845
Okay, go.

48:47.845 --> 48:49.054
Come on.

48:51.890 --> 48:52.933
Come on!

48:54.268 --> 48:56.687
Come on, come on. Come on.

49:03.527 --> 49:04.945
You okay?
