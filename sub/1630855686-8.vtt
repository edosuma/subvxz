00:06.382 --> 00:08.092
<i> You told them all
you were dead.</i>

00:08.092 --> 00:09.385
<i>Did you think
that protects them?</i>

00:09.385 --> 00:12.680
Just makes them easier
for Ishamael to get to.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.848
-  No!

00:13.848 --> 00:15.766
The more wolf you are,

00:15.766 --> 00:17.977
<i>the more you're mine.</i>

00:17.977 --> 00:19.478
What are you?

00:20.604 --> 00:22.356
- Where will we go now?
- Falme.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.276
<i> Mat, you can't go.
You kill Rand.</i>

00:25.276 --> 00:27.778
<i> This "tea"
shows you things.</i>

00:28.654 --> 00:30.823
Lets you glimpse
your past lives.

00:30.823 --> 00:33.492
<i>And through all of that,</i>

00:33.492 --> 00:34.493
<i>the real one.</i>

00:34.493 --> 00:36.454
<i> Damn prick like him.</i>

00:36.454 --> 00:37.913
<i> Did you feel it?</i>

00:37.913 --> 00:39.373
<i>Our affinity?</i>

00:41.667 --> 00:43.335
<i> I could never hurt you.</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:45.463
<i>You will never leave me.</i>

00:45.463 --> 00:46.964
I will kill you.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.215
What do you think
it'll do?

00:48.215 --> 00:50.092
- <i> I don't know,</i>

00:50.092 --> 00:51.385
but I hope it hurts.

00:54.305 --> 00:56.557
<i> Turak has a room
of curiosities.</i>

00:56.557 --> 00:57.933
<i>It's barely guarded.</i>

00:57.933 --> 00:59.769
<i>The Horn is what matters, Builder.</i>

00:59.769 --> 01:01.687
Aren't you worried
I'll betray you?

01:01.687 --> 01:02.688
Will you?

01:02.688 --> 01:03.856
They would never turn.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.691
I thought that, too, once.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.151
Tell me what he's planning.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.861
<i> What do you think
Rand will do</i>

01:08.861 --> 01:11.363
<i>when he sees his friends
are all lost?</i>

01:11.363 --> 01:12.698
Tell me!

01:12.698 --> 01:14.283
<i> He will break.</i>

01:14.283 --> 01:15.910
<i> But why Falme,
of all places?</i>

01:15.910 --> 01:18.287
The Dragon is supposed to
proclaim himself there.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.832
They want everyone to know
who I am

01:21.832 --> 01:24.168
before they try to kill me.

01:31.217 --> 01:33.427
I don't want to do this again.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.346
Not to you.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.932
The others will
know you're coming.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.017
I already have them...

01:41.227 --> 01:43.938
...Moghedien, Sammael,
and the rest of the Forsaken.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.397
This is our chance, Lews.

01:46.649 --> 01:49.944
To break the wheel,
make it stop.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.488
You really think I'd do that?

01:54.323 --> 01:56.408
All the people we love
would die.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.036
They'll die
no matter what you do.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.164
So, go ahead.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.666
Kill me.

02:04.375 --> 02:07.086
And you and I can dance this
dance again in our next lives.

02:10.297 --> 02:15.219
I don't want to do this again.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.513
I'm not going to kill you.

02:18.806 --> 02:22.393
They say you will be conscious,
but not aware.

02:22.726 --> 02:23.894
Like a dream.

02:25.521 --> 02:29.483
They say this seal is so strong,
not even I could break it.

02:32.611 --> 02:33.445
No.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.489
No. Lews.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.034
Please.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.664
I know how much
you hate being alive.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.876
And for that, I am so very,
truly sorry, my friend.

02:47.710 --> 02:48.544
But...

02:49.795 --> 02:51.171
I don't want to...

02:52.089 --> 02:53.841
do this again.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.515
<i> We only have
a few hours to take the Tower.</i>

05:06.515 --> 05:09.226
That's where they'll keep
the witches fighting with them.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.770
Until we kill them, there's
no hope of taking the city.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.065
Our scouts estimate they
have 28 of the women with them.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.400
No one said it would be easy.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.819
Our enemy outnumbers us,
they are better supplied,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.071
better armed, better fortified,

05:21.071 --> 05:22.740
but we have something
they don't.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.242
That's all for now.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.248
Why do you pretend we can win?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.044
There's tens of thousands
of them, Father.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.420
Should we give up?

05:38.464 --> 05:40.966
The Watchers on the Waves
called for help,

05:40.966 --> 05:43.469
letters to every queen,
every king in the world,

05:43.469 --> 05:45.429
to the Amyrlin Seat herself,

05:45.429 --> 05:47.014
begging,

05:47.014 --> 05:48.599
but no one came.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.768
You did.

05:50.768 --> 05:53.812
These strangers are
slavers and murderers.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.814
We fight them because we must.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.236
You think there's a chance
the prophecy is true?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.074
They say in Falme's
greatest moment of need,

06:05.074 --> 06:06.992
the Dragon will return to us.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.745
<i>"Above the Watchers
shall the Dragon be proclaimed,</i>

06:09.745 --> 06:13.207
bannered cross the sky in fire."

06:13.207 --> 06:17.336
Prophecies are just the lies
of long-dead witches.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.677
You two are being
very quiet back there.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.638
Should I worry?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.227
This is it?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.270
The Waygate to Falme?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.982
- Open it.
-  Why don't you?

06:38.982 --> 06:41.819
Ishamael took my power from me.

06:41.819 --> 06:46.740
Ooh, you are so good
at twisting your words in knots.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.953
I know you've got it back.
I can see it in you.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.208
You're alive
only because I allow it.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.418
Because you have
a role to play still.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.050
When the time comes,
raise the banner.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.525
Where are we?

07:28.407 --> 07:29.992
<i> You channeled
in the Ways!</i>

07:29.992 --> 07:31.535
Machin Shin.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.038
- Open it.
-  There are
faster ways

07:35.038 --> 07:36.540
to Falme than this, even,

07:36.540 --> 07:38.500
but I can't take
all that dead weight with us.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.128
How can you think
I'd ever trust you again?

07:41.128 --> 07:45.174
I'm the only one who actually
cares about you, Rand.

07:45.174 --> 07:49.011
Everyone else--
Ishamael, Moiraine--

07:49.011 --> 07:50.929
they just care about
what you can do.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.890
Come with me.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.267
Do I have any choice?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.770
You know who I am.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.693
Now close your eyes.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.011
That doesn't belong here.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.185
This will be
a long morning, I think.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.521
What does that mean?

08:41.521 --> 08:44.900
Many people will wake
from the dream today.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.371
Stay.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.706
It's not safe.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.416
I'll be back.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.068
What are you doing here?

09:29.820 --> 09:31.822
I brought Rand.

09:31.822 --> 09:32.823
Now?

09:32.823 --> 09:34.700
To Falme?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.702
Oh, don't be upset.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.996
We're nowhere close to ready.

09:38.996 --> 09:42.833
Listen to me. I know you.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.129
You will be putting this off
for years.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.340
Each time saying, "Just one
more piece to put in place."

09:51.842 --> 09:54.428
You're delaying the inevitable.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.804
It will either happen
or it won't.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.182
No amount of time
or planning will change that.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.812
He's not going to choose us,

10:03.812 --> 10:05.856
it's too soon.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.443
He's ready.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.171
I told him that
I'd help him kill you.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.923
Will you?

10:31.923 --> 10:34.384
If he's
going to join us,

10:34.384 --> 10:37.346
he needs to see that
we aren't all the same.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.183
Why did I wake you?

10:42.976 --> 10:46.355
Oh, sweetheart, it's because
you know you need me.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.067
I balance you.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.985
And I you.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.892
What is that?

11:25.143 --> 11:26.978
Can't see anything.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.089
Close the gates!

12:06.309 --> 12:07.644
To the Tower!

12:07.644 --> 12:08.770
Hyah.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.069
How do I look?

12:26.538 --> 12:27.622
It's good.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.959
What now?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.172
Now she's going
to tell us everything

12:35.172 --> 12:36.756
about the place
they call the kennels.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.426
Take your spot
in battle.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.928
The city is under attack
from Whitecloaks.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.516
The High Lady has ordered
all <i>sul'dam</i> and damane

12:46.516 --> 12:48.101
to take part in the defense.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.563
Your behavior
in this cell is one thing,

12:51.563 --> 12:53.273
but when a damane disobeys

12:53.273 --> 12:54.983
orders in battle,

12:54.983 --> 12:57.360
the first punishment
is to take her tongue.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.031
The second, her hands.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.409
Now stand!

13:17.172 --> 13:20.342
I said stand.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.153
Perhaps it'll hurt more
if I take this.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.872
Now... come.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.423
My master, you called for me.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.300
Lanfear's betrayed us.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.677
But she's sworn to him.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.929
There are many paths
to walk through the night.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.722
I'll have to remove her
from the board.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.848
How?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.768
The Great Lord gave her
eternal life.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.770
That's for me to worry about.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.272
I have another task for you.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.607
The Dragon might not
swear his oaths.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.401
We haven't had enough time.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.861
But you need him
to break the Wheel.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.323
He'll only break the Wheel
if he turns to the Dark.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.158
And he'll only turn if he thinks

14:27.158 --> 14:29.494
it'll save his friends
from doing the same.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.996
We forced them toward it today.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.707
I may have to wait
until his next life.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.668
I suppose I have nothing
if not time.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.172
- Would you like me to kill him?
- No.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.925
I know who kills him.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.635
And what he uses to do it.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.441
Ah, Mat Cauthon,

14:59.441 --> 15:00.775
my best and poorest customer.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.527
Padan Fain.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.696
- What are you doing here?

15:21.129 --> 15:22.714
Don't lie to me.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.594
Where would they
have taken Egwene?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.846
Take this off me.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.807
I swear,
I will give you anything.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.727
We don't
have time for this.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.147
What are you doing to her?

15:40.857 --> 15:43.151
I can feel her in my mind.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.737
It's like a bundle
of sensations.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.740
All I have to do is push.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.576
Don't lie to me.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.996
She'll be on the Tower.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.540
But we can't go.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.376
I don't want anyone
to see me like this.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.419
We are going to the Tower,

16:01.419 --> 16:03.922
and you will take us there.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.173
And if you don't,

16:05.173 --> 16:07.967
if you even try to get help...

16:10.679 --> 16:12.055
I promise you,

16:12.055 --> 16:13.723
I'll make you curse
the first kiss

16:13.723 --> 16:15.225
your mother
ever gave your father.

17:11.322 --> 17:14.868
What makes you think that I'm
stupid enough to touch it again?

17:14.868 --> 17:18.163
I know you went back
to the Tower to find it.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.707
You abandoned
your friends for it.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.668
No point lying to me, Mat.
I can see the shadow in you.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.378
We all can.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.383
But to see the darkest parts
of yourself,

17:30.383 --> 17:32.093
to accept them,

17:32.093 --> 17:34.179
to embrace them...

17:35.388 --> 17:37.265
Well, that's real strength, Mat.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.268
Pretend they don't exist

17:40.268 --> 17:42.854
like you're some hero
from a gleeman's tale.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.483
We both know that's not you.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.453
I'm not gonna touch it.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.875
I think you will.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.548
Left long enough alone
in this room

18:10.548 --> 18:13.927
with just your thoughts
and that dagger?

18:15.178 --> 18:16.888
You deserve it, Mat.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.756
The bond,

18:51.756 --> 18:53.758
are we going to talk about it?

18:53.758 --> 18:56.427
Do you really want it back?

18:56.427 --> 18:58.471
After everything
I've done to you?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.099
I never asked for my bond
to be released,

19:01.099 --> 19:02.559
nor will I.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.019
Stop pretending, Moiraine.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.608
I think you're afraid.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.862
You don't want me to know
how weak you feel.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.574
How unprepared.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.993
Overwhelmed.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.372
Because then you'll
have to face it yourself.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.420
You can't hurt me
anymore, Moiraine.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.672
It took me a long time
to accept what you said,

19:32.672 --> 19:34.632
about us not being equals,

19:34.632 --> 19:36.885
but I understand it now.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.554
And I believe in what you do,

19:39.554 --> 19:41.139
even now,

19:41.139 --> 19:42.932
when I know not half of it.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.522
The only reason
that I was able to say

19:49.522 --> 19:51.357
that you're not my equal...

19:52.567 --> 19:54.402
...is that I've known
one thing to be true

19:54.402 --> 19:56.070
since the first day we met.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.451
You have always been my better.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.883
Let me back in.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.628
Move!

21:35.628 --> 21:36.921
-  Watch out!
-  Over here!

21:39.507 --> 21:41.676
You're sure my friends
are this way?

21:41.676 --> 21:43.678
You really saw an Ogier
over here?

21:43.678 --> 21:46.139
I know what I saw.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.107
Hold it.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.152
Perrin Aybara.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.528
Thank the Light.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.115
Ingtar.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.325
Masema.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.328
The Horn. How did you get it?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.456
We had help,
a lady from Cairhien.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.708
They'll realize what we've done
soon. We need to get going.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.918
- We can't leave
Mistress al'Vere.
- Egwene?

22:15.918 --> 22:18.713
The Seanchan have her.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.798
Sorry, do you know what that is?

22:20.798 --> 22:22.675
Do you know how many of our men
in Fal Dara died

22:22.675 --> 22:24.260
protecting that?

22:24.260 --> 22:27.180
The Horn of Valere summons
the dead heroes of the past.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.223
It's the key to the Dragon
winning the Last Battle.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.726
What of the heroes of today?

22:33.311 --> 22:35.146
That is what we are now.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.231
We are all

22:37.231 --> 22:39.484
the heroes
of another age's legend.

22:40.735 --> 22:43.237
I think it's time
we start acting like it.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.825
Where is she?

22:50.578 --> 22:52.246
<i>Sul'dam,</i> with me!

22:53.331 --> 22:54.832
Take your positions.

23:03.674 --> 23:04.675
<i>Tia'obiyan!</i>

23:10.681 --> 23:12.475
Take the Tower!

23:42.755 --> 23:43.840
Take the Tower.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.135
Take the Tower, men.
Kill the witches.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.719
- To the Tower.
- Kill the witches.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.181
Burn the witches!

24:08.156 --> 24:09.949
Good girl.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.871
The <i>sul'dam</i>
are on the Tower

24:14.871 --> 24:16.497
and our soldiers are
in the streets now,

24:16.497 --> 24:18.040
searching for the Horn.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.834
Those who have sworn
the oaths should be protected,

24:19.834 --> 24:22.420
but cut down any man
who raises a sword against us.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.339
The only thing that matters is
the Horn of Valere.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.675
Stand aside.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.930
I said stand aside.

24:32.930 --> 24:36.392
You people did this
to her.

24:36.392 --> 24:37.894
A heron-marked sword.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.478
Let us see what is required

24:39.478 --> 24:41.397
to earn the heron blade

24:41.397 --> 24:43.774
on this side of the ocean.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.377
From birth
to death, I serve the blood.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.656
They understand battle well,
these women.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.824
-  Are you ready to fight?

25:34.825 --> 25:37.787
One man could hold 50 here.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.664
There's no need for that.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.217
They're coming this way.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.219
Go! Take the Horn!

25:53.219 --> 25:56.555
- Ingtar!
- For the Light and Shinowa!

26:18.035 --> 26:20.496
Go! I'll hold them!

26:43.853 --> 26:46.605
You're faster than
you used to be.

26:48.691 --> 26:51.235
Feels like I'm running
without buckets on my back.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.240
You're thinking about Lanfear.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.327
I still don't understand
why he only woke her.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.704
They're too dangerous,
I think, the others.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.874
The Forsaken fought among themselves

27:04.874 --> 27:07.168
as much as they fought
the Dragon.

27:07.168 --> 27:10.338
But everything that I could
find out said that Lanfear,

27:10.338 --> 27:13.382
Lews Therin and Ishamael
were inseparable

27:13.382 --> 27:14.759
before the War of Power.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.511
They were best friends.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.015
Just like these kids.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.902
I think I know where we are.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.238
Lanfear planned this.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.955
Master Domon.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.335
Lady Selene. You're a long
way from Cairhien.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.337
What do you be doing here?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.756
The city's under attack.

27:53.756 --> 27:56.467
A good lady like yourself,
you-you shouldn't be here.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.010
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.929
And neither are you.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.723
You know that broken piece
of cuendillar

28:02.723 --> 28:05.684
- I sold you a few months back?
- Aye.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.313
Well, I have an inkling
that when this city falls,

28:09.313 --> 28:12.900
I can get my hands on some
that are fully intact.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.443
Six of them.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.070
Won't be worth much
if we're dead.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.239
Oh, you're not going
to sell them.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.908
You're going to take them to
the deepest part of the ocean

28:20.908 --> 28:23.994
and throw them in, where no one
can ever, ever find them.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.122
Dump them?

28:26.122 --> 28:29.083
But... that's a fortune
I'd be throwing away.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.585
Oh, I'll make it
worth your while.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.424
Go to your boat and wait for me.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.676
I'll bring them tonight.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.565
Does he really think
that I won't be

28:52.565 --> 28:54.483
on the front lines
of Falme's defense?

28:54.483 --> 28:56.569
There's glory to be won today.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.823
Where have you been?

29:00.823 --> 29:03.576
I had other tasks to attend to.

29:04.618 --> 29:05.953
The girl's in place?

29:05.953 --> 29:07.705
The whole city can see her.

29:07.705 --> 29:11.292
It should be me on the Tower
defending our people.

29:11.292 --> 29:14.378
Now that Turak is dead,
it's me the pe...

29:14.378 --> 29:15.713
Turak is dead?

29:15.713 --> 29:18.215
And the Horn stolen.

29:18.215 --> 29:21.177
If My Lord remembers,
you gave it to Turak

29:21.177 --> 29:22.803
for safekeeping. Perhaps...

29:22.803 --> 29:24.763
Stop talking.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.017
Lanfear, she's working
against us.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.394
You've held your strongest
damane in reserve like I asked?

29:32.396 --> 29:34.064
Take them to a ship
directly below the Tower,

29:34.064 --> 29:35.858
where you have a clear line
of sight on it,

29:35.858 --> 29:38.903
and wait for my signal.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.489
But, Lord, I just...

29:41.489 --> 29:43.908
They know how to gentle a man?

29:45.743 --> 29:47.495
Of course.

31:27.136 --> 31:28.554
An hour.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.641
I thought surely you'd last
longer than that

31:32.641 --> 31:34.018
before you touched the...

31:34.018 --> 31:37.563
The thing is, I have spent
my fair share of time

31:37.563 --> 31:39.398
in a cell this year.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.443
And I've learned there's usually
more than one way out of them.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.445
What?
Stop him!

31:53.662 --> 31:56.707
Guards! Guards! Guards!

31:57.541 --> 31:58.876
Don't move!

32:00.169 --> 32:01.545
Come back!

32:01.545 --> 32:02.713
Go, go!

32:19.146 --> 32:20.606
Again, Egwene.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.536
No.

32:34.536 --> 32:37.456
Renna, have you lost control
of your damane?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.124
No.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.835
No, I have not.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.080
We made it.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.250
Wait. Do you hear that?

33:24.670 --> 33:26.130
This is your last chance.

33:26.130 --> 33:27.756
Defy me again.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.520
It's working.
It's actually working.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.605
Did you not trust in the Light?

33:43.605 --> 33:45.774
Signal the archers!

33:45.774 --> 33:48.736
People of Falme,
pick up your weapons!

33:48.736 --> 33:51.405
Fight with us.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.490
Send these slavers
back where they came from.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.508
Egwene.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.151
- Nynaeve!
- I'm here.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.107
Wait.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.028
Let's go.

36:01.451 --> 36:02.369
Whoa!

36:02.369 --> 36:03.412
- No, no.
- Wait, Perrin!

36:03.412 --> 36:05.956
- Perrin! Perrin! Perrin!
- Mat!

36:05.956 --> 36:09.084
Oh, my old friend Perrin.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.211
- Mat. Mat.
- I don't believe it.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.171
Perrin, oh,
what are you doing here?

36:13.171 --> 36:15.048
Who are...

36:15.048 --> 36:17.092
Who in Light's name
are these people?

36:17.092 --> 36:20.053
They're, uh, friends.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.264
- I hope your friends
can fight.

36:22.264 --> 36:23.849
Move!

36:34.610 --> 36:35.986
This is your fault.

36:35.986 --> 36:39.323
The Tower was hit from our
position. You did this.

36:39.323 --> 36:40.407
Good.

37:00.928 --> 37:03.305
Oh, stupid Egwene.

37:03.305 --> 37:07.851
The a'dam only works
on women who can channel.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.269
I know.

37:11.313 --> 37:14.024
What?

37:14.024 --> 37:17.569
It didn't make sense to me how
we could connect to each other.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.197
At first I thought it was like
the Warder bond.

37:20.197 --> 37:24.117
But then I realized that
you can see our weaves, too.

37:24.117 --> 37:27.746
You feel it when I channel
because we're linked.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.416
We're the same.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.545
You <i>sul'dam</i> are just
so weak in the Power,

37:35.545 --> 37:36.797
the Searchers didn't find you.

37:36.797 --> 37:41.218
No.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.889
The first rule.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.185
You cannot hurt your <i>sul'dam.</i>

37:53.772 --> 37:55.857
The only way you're
getting out of this collar

37:55.857 --> 37:58.986
is if I let you out.

37:58.986 --> 38:02.322
- But first...

38:02.322 --> 38:04.658
...you have to let me out.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.507
You're still my damane.

38:20.507 --> 38:23.427
You still feel what I feel.

38:23.427 --> 38:26.471
If I die, you die.

38:54.166 --> 38:57.461
Please... use it.

39:46.343 --> 39:47.928
Egwene.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.307
Egwene.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.297
Egwene...

40:24.297 --> 40:25.382
Rand'll be headed where she is.

40:25.382 --> 40:26.800
Rand? Are you sure?

40:26.800 --> 40:28.969
Yes, he's alive. I've seen
him with my own two eyes.

40:28.969 --> 40:32.055
He's got shit hair,
but he's alive.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.932
We must get the Horn
to Rand al'Thor.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.934
We can't even open it.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.436
Why didn't you say that?

40:39.521 --> 40:41.189
Of course.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.987
I'm here.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.118
How?

40:55.036 --> 40:55.954
Why?

40:55.954 --> 40:58.790
I came to save you.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.877
But it looks like
you didn't need it.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.634
I'm sorry,
I should have told you.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.137
I thought it would be better
this way.

41:14.890 --> 41:17.017
I'm sorry.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.813
Come on, let's get out
of here.

41:24.566 --> 41:26.276
All right?

41:30.530 --> 41:32.782
-  In the flesh
this time.

41:33.783 --> 41:34.826
Welcome.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.205
Ishamael.

42:10.445 --> 42:13.531
It's the same as your last life.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.825
You try to be so honorable...

42:17.118 --> 42:18.536
...so proud,

42:18.536 --> 42:20.872
so perfect.

42:20.872 --> 42:25.126
I'm not Lews Therin.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.964
Maybe next time
it'll be different.

42:33.969 --> 42:37.264
Hold the shield on him
until we get the signal.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.851
Then we gentle him.

42:41.851 --> 42:44.729
I don't want
to do this again.

42:46.940 --> 42:49.150
And I don't think you do either.

42:50.735 --> 42:51.736
Look at her.

42:51.736 --> 42:54.155
You abandoned her.

42:54.155 --> 42:56.658
You made her a killer.

42:56.658 --> 42:57.951
If you keep fighting him,

42:57.951 --> 43:00.662
you'll turn them all
to the Dark.

43:00.662 --> 43:03.164
Just like you did
in your last life.

43:04.708 --> 43:07.252
Just like you did to me.

43:27.856 --> 43:29.691
- Get him, get him.
- Get the Horn to Rand!

43:34.779 --> 43:36.823
Perrin, I'm not leaving you.

43:36.823 --> 43:38.199
I'm not.

43:38.199 --> 43:40.493
None of this matters
if Rand doesn't have that.

43:40.493 --> 43:41.745
You're his only hope.

43:41.745 --> 43:43.621
We'll buy you
some time. Go!

43:45.832 --> 43:47.500
Get him! Don't move!

43:47.500 --> 43:48.543
Get him!

43:58.053 --> 43:59.763
Two Rivers?

44:27.040 --> 44:27.999
Move!

44:33.088 --> 44:35.382
Close your eyes,

44:35.382 --> 44:38.510
picture a bud, soft like...

44:38.510 --> 44:40.220
I can't do it like that.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.846
It's either there, or it's not.

44:43.515 --> 44:45.850
You can do it, Nynaeve.

44:50.271 --> 44:51.439
You.

45:00.740 --> 45:04.702
Now we'll find out
what you really are.

45:25.014 --> 45:27.142
- No.

45:31.604 --> 45:33.648
Valda, with me.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.295
-  Attack!

47:33.851 --> 47:34.852
I...

47:36.145 --> 47:37.313
I...

47:38.439 --> 47:39.899
I remember.

48:15.685 --> 48:18.104
The Heroes of the Horn.

48:22.609 --> 48:23.818
I am one of you.

48:23.818 --> 48:27.071
I have fought by your side
times beyond number.

48:29.866 --> 48:31.743
Fight with us once more.

48:36.956 --> 48:40.585
Well, let's not just
fecking stand here.

48:54.974 --> 49:00.563
<i>Dovie'andi se tovya sagain!</i>

49:38.559 --> 49:39.769
Father.

49:41.896 --> 49:43.564
No. No!

49:43.564 --> 49:44.524
Father!

49:44.524 --> 49:46.275
Perrin, look out.

49:50.196 --> 49:51.989
- Perrin. Perrin.

49:52.949 --> 49:54.617
No.

49:54.617 --> 49:56.244
No!

49:56.244 --> 49:57.328
Two Rivers!

49:57.328 --> 49:58.663
Oh, no, no!

49:58.663 --> 50:00.248
No!

50:00.248 --> 50:05.378
Don't be so bloody surprised
I'm a Hero of the Horn.

50:07.130 --> 50:08.881
Get to Rand. We'll hold them.

50:42.874 --> 50:44.917
It's all right.

50:44.917 --> 50:47.962
Use what you know.
You're a Wisdom.

50:51.924 --> 50:53.176
I'm-I'm going to
push it through.

50:53.176 --> 50:55.011
This will hurt.

51:06.856 --> 51:09.859
- It's through.

51:11.903 --> 51:14.113
We have
to get to Egwene.

51:14.113 --> 51:16.115
- Can you...?
- I'm all right.

51:19.827 --> 51:20.787
Leave me.

51:20.787 --> 51:22.955
I'll just slow you down.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.833
We don't know if I'll be able
to channel when I get there.

51:27.084 --> 51:29.754
Whatever she's facing,
she needs you, not me.

51:34.175 --> 51:35.510
Well...

51:35.510 --> 51:38.638
it looks like our time is up.

51:38.638 --> 51:40.306
Will you join us?

51:48.981 --> 51:50.942
I will never serve him.

51:52.985 --> 51:54.821
In a thousand lives,

51:54.821 --> 51:57.031
I never have.

51:57.031 --> 51:59.367
I know that.

51:59.367 --> 52:01.118
I'm sure of it.

52:03.454 --> 52:04.872
She's right, you know.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.751
You're so much like Lews.

52:09.794 --> 52:11.295
But different, too.

52:18.845 --> 52:20.555
Ah, well.

52:35.611 --> 52:37.488
Rand. Rand, brother, I'm sorry.

52:37.488 --> 52:38.573
I'm so sorry.

52:41.659 --> 52:44.161
Rand. Rand.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.206
Rand.
Rand.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.585
Such a simple illusion.

52:50.585 --> 52:52.962
How could you not see it?

52:52.962 --> 52:57.091
Rand, Rand, Rand,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

52:57.091 --> 52:58.885
Rand.

52:58.885 --> 53:00.261
I'm sorry.

53:00.261 --> 53:02.054
If it's any consolation...

53:03.806 --> 53:06.392
...I'm sorry, too, old friend.

53:07.435 --> 53:08.519
I truly am.

53:15.234 --> 53:16.235
How did you...?

53:18.946 --> 53:20.156
You.

53:20.156 --> 53:22.408
You cannot face down

53:22.408 --> 53:23.868
one of the Chosen, child.

53:51.145 --> 53:54.357
Keep moving. There's soldiers
on these cliffs. What is it?

53:54.357 --> 53:56.943
- Shielding.
-  Are there weaves?

53:58.152 --> 53:59.904
I think it's Rand
they're shielding.

53:59.904 --> 54:00.988
Why?

54:02.323 --> 54:04.825
You don't know who they are.

54:04.825 --> 54:06.702
What if Lanfear put us here
for you to do this?

54:06.702 --> 54:08.287
What if those ships
are full of innocent people?

54:08.287 --> 54:09.497
What if it's not Rand?

54:09.497 --> 54:10.957
I will let a thousand
innocent people die

54:10.957 --> 54:12.667
if there's even a chance
that he will live.

54:13.668 --> 54:16.170
That is what it means to support
him, you do understand that?

55:19.900 --> 55:21.068
Keep going.

55:24.655 --> 55:25.656
I'm sorry.

55:33.372 --> 55:35.207
Perrin?

55:35.207 --> 55:36.208
I'm here.

55:36.208 --> 55:37.877
Nynaeve's here, too.

55:40.087 --> 55:42.214
Go. Hurry.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.263
I'm sorry.

55:50.931 --> 55:52.516
It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

55:54.143 --> 55:56.937
Rand. Rand.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.036
Who are you?

56:14.705 --> 56:15.915
Elayne.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.774
Rand. Rand, you're gonna have
to do something.

56:41.774 --> 56:43.359
I can't.

56:44.985 --> 56:46.403
I'm shielded.

58:28.255 --> 58:29.590
It's...

58:31.967 --> 58:33.928
It's beautiful.

58:33.928 --> 58:35.804
Do you see it, Lews?

58:37.223 --> 58:39.058
What do you see?

58:40.976 --> 58:42.394
Nothing.

58:44.396 --> 58:46.232
Nothing at all.

59:14.051 --> 59:15.886
They're retreating.

59:24.770 --> 59:27.147
"Above the Watchers shall
the Dragon be proclaimed..."

59:28.691 --> 59:31.277
"...bannered
'cross the sky in fire."

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.732
<i>Car'a'carn.</i>

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:08.517
Softly, softly,

01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:12.187
from the shadows.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.486
Softly, softly,

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:22.030
from the shadows.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.824
Moghedien.

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.746
Ishamael let us out.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.583
All of us. He had

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:36.753
this sneaking suspicion
you were going to betray him.

01:02:42.176 --> 01:02:43.510
Where are the others?

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.107
Yeah.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.610
You and Ishamael

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:03.280
were always too close
to the Dragon.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.241
The rest of us
don't share that failing.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.995
"Softly, softly,
from the shadows."

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:13.499
That's what you always said
about me, isn't it?

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:15.209
That I was too cautious,

01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:16.835
too afraid...

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:21.215
...too weak.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:30.557
You don't want to fight me.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:36.146
Mm, this is not a fight.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.525
This is a warning.

01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:43.320
When I strike, I don't miss.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.448
Stay away from him, Lanfear.

01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:49.201
He's ours now.

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:51.328
All five of them are.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.382
Softly, softly,
from the shadows.

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:25.654
Light help you, Rand al'Thor.
