WEBVTT

00:00.082 --> 00:02.602
- Previously, on The Fosters...
- This is so cool.

00:02.643 --> 00:04.065
We wanna build this massive tree house.

00:04.077 --> 00:05.893
- I'm moving.
- Were you gonna tell us?

00:05.909 --> 00:08.132
I got evicted. That's why
I took the job in Tahoe.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.024
Gabe's homeless. Can
he move into the garage?

00:10.049 --> 00:13.150
To require a permission
slip implicates the school.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.982
We're asking Monte to resign.

00:15.038 --> 00:16.568
What kind of endowment do
you think we're going to need

00:16.611 --> 00:18.761
to convert Anchor Beach
from charter to private?

00:18.798 --> 00:21.778
We've decided to waive
the "no closed doors" rule.

00:21.815 --> 00:23.744
Side effects include impotence.

00:23.787 --> 00:25.814
She isn't pregnant anymore.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.016
Jesus and I were babies calling
out for our mom, but she never came.

00:30.053 --> 00:33.056
- What's that?
- It's the letter that Emma wrote to Jesus.

00:33.072 --> 00:34.432
Emma didn't want anyone else finding it.

00:34.450 --> 00:37.025
For your sake, I hope that he never
finds out that you knew all along.

00:37.068 --> 00:39.347
Russell gonna be mad
as hell I got busted.

00:39.366 --> 00:41.295
I can't do this anymore.

00:41.362 --> 00:43.500
If you help us build a
case against your pimp,

00:43.512 --> 00:44.839
we're gonna put him behind bars.

00:44.864 --> 00:46.978
You're really lucky that
Seth got you into G.U.

00:46.990 --> 00:50.262
- Daddy, it's me, Diamond. I love you.
- I love you, too, a'ight?

00:50.293 --> 00:51.712
You gotta bring one
of those girls, baby.

00:51.743 --> 00:55.229
- What happened with your lawyers?
- My birth dad's gonna pay off the victims.

00:55.252 --> 00:58.141
Good for you. I shouldn't
have let you get my hopes up,

00:58.164 --> 01:00.237
- but hey, that's on me, right?
- If the DA finds out

01:00.283 --> 01:02.100
that you broke into Doug
Harvey's house, that's it!

01:02.118 --> 01:04.206
You're gonna go to prison.
A trial date has been set.

01:04.327 --> 01:06.153
It's a week from today.

01:24.653 --> 01:25.896
_

01:28.326 --> 01:29.406
Hey.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.326
How was your overnight with Aaron?

01:32.329 --> 01:33.880
Did you sleep in the same room?

01:33.958 --> 01:35.556
We were at his parents' house.

01:35.781 --> 01:37.332
You didn't slip into his bedroom?

01:37.619 --> 01:38.912
No.

01:41.881 --> 01:43.031
Maybe.

01:43.847 --> 01:45.440
Oh my God! Did you have sex?

01:45.465 --> 01:47.495
- No.
- Maybe?

01:47.615 --> 01:51.220
No, we just kissed for a
little bit and then fell asleep.

01:52.482 --> 01:54.148
So this is, like, a thing?

01:54.184 --> 01:55.483
I don't know.

01:55.519 --> 01:57.143
I don't really know
about anything right now.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.425
Hey.

02:04.714 --> 02:07.228
Can I tell you something
but you can't tell Moms?

02:08.473 --> 02:11.373
No. I seriously don't wanna
know. I'm done with secrets.

02:11.452 --> 02:14.269
Oh... so now you're done with secrets.

02:14.564 --> 02:15.940
Thanks a lot.

02:21.582 --> 02:23.361
What was this letter
doing in your pocket?

02:23.779 --> 02:24.816
Um...

02:25.690 --> 02:28.305
Emma asked me to take it so
no one else would read it.

02:28.425 --> 02:30.630
- Who's read it?
- Has Jesus read it?

02:30.689 --> 02:33.795
No, j... just me and...

02:34.592 --> 02:35.801
Grandma.

02:36.155 --> 02:38.932
- Grandma?
- She read it to Jesus because

02:38.957 --> 02:42.024
- he couldn't... read.
- Okay, so then Jesus does know about it.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.365
No, she... skipped the part about...

02:44.663 --> 02:46.792
The abortion. You can say it.

02:47.057 --> 02:49.667
So, h... how... how
do you know about this?

02:52.936 --> 02:53.988
I...

02:55.178 --> 02:56.936
took her to go get it.

03:34.127 --> 03:38.560
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:39.912 --> 03:41.780
Are you gonna tell her you... you know?

03:41.900 --> 03:43.524
I don't know if that's our place.

03:43.644 --> 03:45.397
Do you know if she's told her parents?

03:45.417 --> 03:47.457
I... I don't... think so.

03:48.957 --> 03:51.011
Are you... gonna tell Jesus?

03:52.393 --> 03:53.395
I think...

03:53.641 --> 03:56.635
- I think that's... our choice?
- I think so.

03:56.684 --> 03:59.190
She... really wants to tell him.

04:00.477 --> 04:02.076
Soon as he's well enough to handle it.

04:02.112 --> 04:03.580
Okay, let us just...

04:03.835 --> 04:05.280
think about this...

04:05.339 --> 04:07.108
for a while, okay? And in the meantime,

04:07.117 --> 04:08.573
please just keep it to yourself.

04:09.152 --> 04:10.184
Okay.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.186
Hey, love, um...

04:12.534 --> 04:13.925
thank you very much

04:13.944 --> 04:15.836
for taking Emma and being there for her.

04:15.861 --> 04:18.392
- That was good of you.
- It really was.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.674
We just told Emma and Jesus

04:26.714 --> 04:28.641
- they could have sex in the house.
- Oh,

04:28.761 --> 04:31.340
I can't believe my
mother didn't tell us.

04:32.175 --> 04:34.317
What are we gonna do with these kids?

04:35.863 --> 04:39.001
And Callie? Her trial's five days away.

04:39.031 --> 04:41.204
We don't even know what
her lawyers are thinking.

04:46.722 --> 04:48.527
We'll know tomorrow.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.563
I'm here.

05:09.683 --> 05:11.079
Didn't wanna scare you.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.970
Too late.

05:16.863 --> 05:19.085
What are you... doin' down here...

05:19.326 --> 05:20.545
alone?

05:27.888 --> 05:29.530
You know, uh...

05:29.805 --> 05:32.645
Moms say there's no way a
jury's gonna convict you on

05:32.660 --> 05:34.454
circumstantial evidence.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.524
How do you feel about Juilliard?

05:40.644 --> 05:42.499
You never really talked about it.

05:44.247 --> 05:46.514
I guess we don't really
talk at all anymore.

05:49.794 --> 05:52.120
I miss us... as friends.

05:54.670 --> 05:55.790
Me, too.

06:01.974 --> 06:04.968
Wow, Jesus. Oh, yeah, these are...

06:05.088 --> 06:06.423
these are really cool.

06:06.487 --> 06:08.650
But before we nail down a design,

06:08.680 --> 06:10.523
we have to find a tree
that we're gonna build in.

06:10.557 --> 06:11.791
Uh, that's my department.

06:11.821 --> 06:14.288
I'm going to a bunch of daycare
centers and public work projects,

06:14.308 --> 06:15.620
so what should I look for?

06:15.654 --> 06:19.119
I... I... I would say
a h... h... h... hard...

06:19.360 --> 06:20.962
- wood tree?
- Right?

06:21.149 --> 06:24.757
Yeah. Yeah, like an oak or a walnut.

06:24.836 --> 06:26.487
- Got it.
- Hi.

06:26.523 --> 06:29.726
I hope I'm not interrupting.
We were on our way to daycare,

06:29.755 --> 06:31.304
and it's near here.

06:31.722 --> 06:34.095
- So, this is Isabella?
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.130 --> 06:36.297
- You've never met her?
- No. Uh-uh.

06:36.346 --> 06:38.190
Isabella, this is Gabe.

06:38.230 --> 06:39.773
she looks like you.

06:39.847 --> 06:41.257
- You think so?
- Yeah.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.722
Hey, do you wanna hold her?

06:42.756 --> 06:44.472
Yeah, sure.

06:44.477 --> 06:46.551
Yeah, there you go.

06:47.343 --> 06:49.310
Hello. Hi.

06:49.345 --> 06:51.137
Be careful, she likes beards.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.462
Um... I should

06:54.160 --> 06:56.082
get going if I'm gonna find this tree.

06:57.969 --> 06:59.640
Talk to you later.

07:00.123 --> 07:01.528
So I talked to my brother,

07:01.567 --> 07:03.818
and he's starting a big commercial job,

07:03.858 --> 07:07.611
- and he's willing to give you another chance.
- Oh, uh... thanks.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.938
Yeah, I'll call him.

07:10.329 --> 07:13.066
Well, I should probably let
you boys get back to work.

07:13.102 --> 07:14.502
Goodbye.

07:15.362 --> 07:17.220
Okay. Let me know if you need any help.

07:17.274 --> 07:18.642
Okay.

07:18.762 --> 07:21.345
- I'm really glad you're feelin' better.
- Thanks.

07:32.288 --> 07:33.624
Um...

07:33.929 --> 07:35.015
so...

07:36.411 --> 07:38.746
have you tried to get any help

07:38.866 --> 07:40.909
with, like, a doctor or something?

07:41.029 --> 07:42.679
Just 'cause Mariana

07:43.023 --> 07:45.043
told me that you're depressed.

07:45.943 --> 07:49.170
Uh... um... yeah.

07:49.290 --> 07:52.234
Yeah, I mean, I... I... I
went and saw someone, but...

07:52.853 --> 07:54.692
you know, they wanted
to put me on pills.

07:55.292 --> 07:57.474
But, you know, they've got a
lotta side effects. I think they...

07:57.594 --> 07:59.347
I think they screw you up more, so...

07:59.382 --> 08:01.908
Yeah. Definitely, I see that.

08:02.404 --> 08:05.135
- Robert's out of town on business.
- Yes, he told us.

08:05.172 --> 08:07.221
We've spoken at length on the strategy.

08:07.482 --> 08:08.568
He's on board.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.815
Well, as long as he's on board, right?

08:15.231 --> 08:16.482
You look great.

08:16.689 --> 08:19.432
Can you try pulling your
hair back into a pony tail?

08:23.320 --> 08:26.185
And of course, on the
day, no makeup at all.

08:26.249 --> 08:28.550
We want you looking as young
and innocent as possible.

08:28.727 --> 08:31.351
Very nice. Good thing she
still has that baby face.

08:31.391 --> 08:34.832
So, aside from this,

08:34.890 --> 08:37.386
uh, make-under, what
exactly is your strategy?

08:37.446 --> 08:38.684
Well, this is a big part of it.

08:38.754 --> 08:41.408
Juries make up their minds
based on first impressions.

08:41.408 --> 08:44.362
We want them to see Callie
as a vulnerable and naive girl

08:44.387 --> 08:47.287
who was manipulated by a former
foster brother convicted of murder.

08:47.302 --> 08:48.688
He didn't manipulate me.

08:48.983 --> 08:51.711
- Hear us out.
- He was wrongly convicted, so...

08:51.952 --> 08:55.304
We think it's important in showing
contrition to tell the court

08:55.319 --> 08:57.555
you realize now, he is guilty.

08:57.675 --> 08:59.048
That the system got it right,

08:59.068 --> 09:00.739
and you're sorry for any distress

09:00.764 --> 09:02.764
- you caused Troy and his family.
- I won't say that.

09:02.773 --> 09:03.737
Callie.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.281
Please. Just... please.

09:08.351 --> 09:10.318
How about Troy Johnson?

09:10.353 --> 09:12.484
I mean, h... have you
looked into this affair

09:12.509 --> 09:14.524
that he was having with
his manager from work?

09:14.544 --> 09:16.849
- It's not relevant.
- 'Cause she was married at the time.

09:16.883 --> 09:19.415
- Does that not reflect on his character?
- Yes, but,

09:19.650 --> 09:21.493
Troy isn't the one being put on trial.

09:21.508 --> 09:24.501
How are we explaining why she ran
from the scene of the accident?

09:24.531 --> 09:27.136
I mean, it... it... okay, is
that not the real issue here?

09:27.170 --> 09:29.633
- Not...
- Ignorance... of the law.

09:29.687 --> 09:31.890
They're going to say she left
because she knew she was at fault.

09:31.894 --> 09:34.549
And we're going to say she left
because she didn't know she couldn't.

09:34.573 --> 09:36.725
I ran because Troy Johnson
killed his grandmother.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.486
- Callie, please.
- We have

09:38.514 --> 09:40.678
his DNA on the murder
weapon to prove it.

09:41.494 --> 09:43.962
Okay, we would like to speak
with our daughter alone, please.

09:53.811 --> 09:56.785
Aaron can testify he called
me while I was in Troy's car

09:56.809 --> 09:59.194
to tell me that Troy's DNA
was on the murder weapon.

09:59.314 --> 10:01.681
No, a male relative's DNA, Callie.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.932
Troy was the only
male relative of Martha

10:03.966 --> 10:05.328
that was alive four years ago. Okay,

10:05.353 --> 10:06.749
there's no question that it's him,

10:06.769 --> 10:09.388
and that explains why I was
afraid of him and why I left.

10:09.752 --> 10:11.841
Well, it makes more sense than this.

10:11.910 --> 10:15.881
Okay, except the prosecution is
gonna ask to see the DNA report,

10:15.920 --> 10:18.044
and they're gonna see that a
third set of DNA was tested,

10:18.073 --> 10:19.930
and that could lead them to Doug Harvey.

10:20.148 --> 10:23.136
- And if they found out how you got that toothbrush...
- I found it...

10:23.981 --> 10:25.878
in his garbage bin on the street.

10:27.062 --> 10:28.935
Never even stepped on his property.

10:38.343 --> 10:40.078
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.366
Does it ever make you feel bad?

10:43.931 --> 10:45.838
Seeing Ana with Isabella?

10:46.074 --> 10:48.561
How good of a mom she is to her?

10:49.967 --> 10:51.952
No. I don't think about it.

10:57.463 --> 10:59.601
Do you remember Ana leaving us?

11:00.225 --> 11:02.073
In our crib when we were babies?

11:02.299 --> 11:05.332
For, like, a whole day or more?

11:06.310 --> 11:07.544
Yeah.

11:08.614 --> 11:10.517
Yeah, actually, I... I had a...

11:11.952 --> 11:14.321
I had a dream about it
when I was in my coma.

11:16.431 --> 11:19.419
We were in our crib and you
were crying, and I was...

11:20.059 --> 11:22.025
I was trying to take care of you.

11:23.111 --> 11:24.763
We were babies.

11:25.992 --> 11:27.251
It wasn't...

11:27.309 --> 11:29.443
your job to take care of me.

11:33.337 --> 11:36.399
My therapist thinks that I
should confront Ana about it.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.866
What? Wh... what would... wh... wh...

11:38.920 --> 11:41.865
what's the point of that? She
was... she was a drug addict.

11:41.899 --> 11:44.131
- So that lets her off the hook?
- No, Mariana,

11:44.150 --> 11:45.934
but she was also, like,
really, really young,

11:45.964 --> 11:49.041
and she never sh...
should've h... had us.

11:50.022 --> 11:51.075
So...

11:52.038 --> 11:53.621
is that what you would've done?

11:55.140 --> 11:56.821
If you were Gabe, would you...

11:57.003 --> 11:58.675
tell her to get an abortion?

11:59.963 --> 12:01.088
No.

12:03.373 --> 12:05.001
I would've been a dad.

12:06.171 --> 12:07.945
No matter how young I
was, I would've stepped up,

12:07.970 --> 12:10.815
and I would've had the kid, and
I would've taken care of him.

12:12.711 --> 12:15.348
But they are not us, okay?

12:15.387 --> 12:17.505
And it does us absolutely no good...

12:18.272 --> 12:19.781
getting mad at them.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.459
What'd your moms say?

12:25.670 --> 12:27.524
They're thinking about it.

12:28.055 --> 12:31.299
You should see the outfit that the
lawyers want me to wear in court.

12:31.343 --> 12:33.358
Ay, ay.

12:33.632 --> 12:35.320
You goin' to court?

12:35.796 --> 12:37.074
What'd you do?

12:37.315 --> 12:40.849
Uh... I was in a car accident.
They think it was my fault.

12:40.873 --> 12:44.220
- And it's none of your business.
- You all up in my business all the time.

12:44.267 --> 12:47.152
Why you never share in group?
Wasn't you in here, too?

12:47.201 --> 12:49.977
- What's your story? Whorin'?
- Gang bangin'.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.589
- My boyfriend's Scorpion Kings.
- You mean your pimp?

12:53.709 --> 12:55.260
You callin' him your
boyfriend don't sound like

12:55.264 --> 12:57.595
-  you're serious about gettin' outta the life.
- You don't know me.

12:57.827 --> 13:00.438
- My mom'll help you.
- Like she helped you?

13:00.721 --> 13:02.196
You still in trouble.

13:02.943 --> 13:04.331
Get back to your chores.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.499
A'ight?

13:10.335 --> 13:11.636
Think she's not for real?

13:11.756 --> 13:12.986
Hard to tell.

13:13.296 --> 13:15.962
Lots of times it's the
quiet ones that actually run.

13:20.579 --> 13:21.631
So...

13:22.033 --> 13:23.515
this Russell, he's like, your pimp?

13:24.489 --> 13:25.846
It ain't like that.

13:26.349 --> 13:28.783
He... is good to me.

13:29.122 --> 13:30.550
Gives me everything I want.

13:30.569 --> 13:32.649
All I gotta do is support us

13:32.932 --> 13:34.745
and turn a few tricks.

13:36.117 --> 13:38.963
Men been having sex with
me since I was 11 years old.

13:39.541 --> 13:41.822
Cousins, uncles.

13:41.983 --> 13:44.150
Nobody ever gave me nothin' for it.

13:44.496 --> 13:46.364
Now I got the power, and

13:46.392 --> 13:48.523
I got somebody that loves me,

13:48.696 --> 13:50.002
protects me.

13:51.020 --> 13:53.599
Nobody ever done nothin'
like that for me before.

13:55.706 --> 13:58.486
So he could like...
get me a record deal?

13:59.245 --> 14:00.578
You take care of him,

14:00.698 --> 14:02.115
and he'll take care of you.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.298
That's how it works in life.

14:04.703 --> 14:06.440
Ain't nothin' for free.

14:08.429 --> 14:10.371
Word on the street is our romeo Russell

14:10.402 --> 14:12.439
helped himself to another
pimp's crystal meth.

14:12.471 --> 14:13.473
Wait. He deals?

14:13.497 --> 14:15.614
He has his girls deal
when he's got product,

14:15.734 --> 14:17.708
so they take the fall if they get caught

14:17.717 --> 14:21.089
- and then the cycle continues.
- I gotta bust this guy.

14:21.209 --> 14:22.554
Tell me about it.

14:22.966 --> 14:25.635
Meet... Russell LeÃƒÂ³n.

14:27.579 --> 14:29.565
Wow, he's on Facebook?

14:29.648 --> 14:31.212
Oh, they're all into social media.

14:31.332 --> 14:33.328
It's a place where they
brag and recruit girls.

14:34.586 --> 14:37.206
He's got two priors...
one misdemeanor drug charge

14:37.224 --> 14:38.716
and a felony concealed weapon.

14:38.764 --> 14:39.982
How many girls does he have?

14:39.986 --> 14:41.234
He usually runs two or three.

14:41.265 --> 14:43.739
Now each girl can make
up to 1,500 a day for him.

14:43.994 --> 14:44.815
Wow.

14:46.709 --> 14:47.452
Ohh...

14:48.139 --> 14:50.524
- man, who is that?
- Brandi.

14:50.953 --> 14:52.684
She was 14 at the time.

14:54.384 --> 14:56.132
Thought he was some kinda Romeo.

14:56.150 --> 14:58.792
Even the Romeos beat their girls
when they aren't earnin' enough

14:58.810 --> 15:00.284
or they're talkin' to another pimp.

15:00.404 --> 15:02.308
- Where is she now?
- We don't know.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.614
We were close to convincin'
her to press charges...

15:04.650 --> 15:05.973
and then she disappeared.

15:06.429 --> 15:07.615
She run away?

15:08.354 --> 15:09.686
Or he killed her.

15:10.112 --> 15:12.325
And the problem is, when
these girls go missing.

15:12.352 --> 15:14.060
It's not like anyone's looking for 'em.

15:22.126 --> 15:24.406
- Jesus should be out back.
- Are we okay?

15:24.572 --> 15:27.455
- What do you mean?
- You've barely been talking to me.

15:28.351 --> 15:30.804
Well, you haven't really
been talking to me, have you?

15:30.970 --> 15:33.349
Can you stop playing
games and just tell me?

15:35.313 --> 15:37.848
Okay, I'm not the one playing games.

15:41.134 --> 15:43.159
Look... I know you had an abortion.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.102
And that you didn't give Jesus a chance

15:46.119 --> 15:47.563
to tell you what he really wanted,

15:47.607 --> 15:49.811
which was to be a dad, by the way.

15:49.847 --> 15:51.326
No matter what.

15:53.982 --> 15:56.079
Well, it really wasn't his choice.

15:57.806 --> 15:58.918
True.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.314
But we're adopted.

16:02.055 --> 16:03.754
So maybe you could've considered that.

16:07.738 --> 16:10.576
Russell said she went
back home to Fresno.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.468
Yeah, you believe that?

16:17.663 --> 16:19.374
You heard from her since?

16:19.954 --> 16:21.663
- No.
- No?

16:22.826 --> 16:25.941
Well, she did not go home to Fresno...

16:26.146 --> 16:29.007
and no one has heard or
seen from her in months.

16:29.127 --> 16:31.233
We think Russell was afraid
she was gonna press charges,

16:31.238 --> 16:32.511
so he made her disappear.

16:33.136 --> 16:35.690
- He didn't beat her.
- Yeah, you sure about that?

16:40.495 --> 16:41.596
I did it.

16:42.666 --> 16:45.467
Bottom bitch gotta keep
the other girls in line.

16:46.637 --> 16:48.318
That's what he told me.

16:48.505 --> 16:53.408
She wasn't earnin' and she was
lettin' another daddy creep up on her.

16:53.890 --> 16:56.445
So he... he made me...

16:56.480 --> 16:59.312
Well, do you have any
idea if he did hurt her...

16:59.666 --> 17:01.702
where he might have left the body?

17:09.393 --> 17:11.805
- You know this guy?
- Yes. Munchie.

17:11.838 --> 17:13.846
Is he the pimp that was
trying to walk up on Brandi?

17:13.965 --> 17:15.244
Yeah.

17:15.365 --> 17:18.223
Word is Russell took some meth from
him. You know anything about that?

17:19.569 --> 17:20.535
No.

17:24.575 --> 17:26.744
Uh, you know what they call

17:27.226 --> 17:30.856
a man who uses young girls
to do his dirty work, Diamond?

17:32.379 --> 17:34.703
A coward. We call him a coward.

17:35.182 --> 17:37.736
And if you testify against him,

17:38.099 --> 17:40.060
we can put him away for life.

17:42.118 --> 17:43.327
I'm scared.

17:43.345 --> 17:46.243
I know you are, honey, I know you
are, but listen to me, look at me.

17:46.740 --> 17:49.476
We can give you a whole new name

17:50.007 --> 17:52.898
and a whole new life that
he knows nothing about.

17:53.018 --> 17:56.270
So he can never, ever find
you, and he will never...

17:56.739 --> 17:58.147
hurt you again.

18:04.886 --> 18:06.094
Okay.

18:13.659 --> 18:15.187
Is that her boyfriend?

18:16.812 --> 18:17.759
No.

18:18.317 --> 18:19.543
No, it's not.

18:20.468 --> 18:22.397
- You got it?
- Yeah.

18:22.432 --> 18:24.666
You sure you should be lifting stuff?

18:24.701 --> 18:27.045
Yeah, I'm fine. It's good
for me to move around.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.431
All right, well...

18:29.497 --> 18:31.221
won't take long.

18:34.495 --> 18:36.745
... really, to go
through all these boxes.

18:37.266 --> 18:40.475
Stop losing junk when I
move from place to place.

18:46.305 --> 18:48.058
Hey, Jesus.

18:48.704 --> 18:49.558
Jesus!

18:49.626 --> 18:50.887
Hey!

18:52.746 --> 18:54.290
Are you... you all right?

18:56.466 --> 18:57.499
Um...

19:00.771 --> 19:03.371
What are... what are... what
are we... what are we doing?

19:04.285 --> 19:05.321
Uh...

19:05.507 --> 19:07.995
we're... we're movin' my stuff in.

19:09.819 --> 19:10.965
Why?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.316
Should I call your mom?

19:18.030 --> 19:21.203
N... no, no. Um... um...

19:21.970 --> 19:25.560
No... no, this... this...
this happens to me sometimes.

19:25.562 --> 19:27.905
I just... I forget what
I'm... what I'm doing.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.699
Well, Jesus, you sure I
shouldn't go get your mom?

19:30.719 --> 19:33.127
Yeah, no, don't. Don't.
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

19:33.154 --> 19:35.471
I'm fine. I... I just...

19:36.066 --> 19:38.340
I stopped taking my meds...

19:38.375 --> 19:42.011
because of the... the side
effects... like you were saying.

19:42.546 --> 19:44.840
Just like you were saying. And...

19:45.968 --> 19:48.350
yeah, I can't have...
I can't have sex...

19:48.385 --> 19:52.269
- when I... when I take my meds.
- Um...

19:53.082 --> 19:56.658
Well, I mean... maybe
that's okay? For now?

19:56.693 --> 19:59.323
You know? Until you... get off of them.

19:59.384 --> 20:01.077
What, in five years?

20:01.553 --> 20:05.247
'Cause they said it's gonna take
five years, and I... I don't...

20:06.347 --> 20:10.739
I... I don't... need... them.
I'm... I'm getting... better, okay?

20:10.739 --> 20:13.566
- So just please... don't tell my moms.
- Hey!

20:13.738 --> 20:17.101
- You gettin' settled in?
- Yeah. Yeah, think so.

20:17.267 --> 20:19.381
Uh, are you guys hungry?
Do you want some lunch?

20:19.416 --> 20:21.213
Oh, I'm... I'm fine, thank you.

20:21.213 --> 20:23.504
- I don't wanna impose more than I am.
- No.

20:23.576 --> 20:25.269
Lunch is not an imposition.

20:25.314 --> 20:27.195
Thanks, but I'll grab somethin' later.

20:27.391 --> 20:31.101
And... just wanted to
thank you again for...

20:31.356 --> 20:32.694
letting me stay here.

20:32.729 --> 20:35.697
Honestly. Um, I won't be here long.

20:35.732 --> 20:37.996
What? No, man, you can
stay as long as you want.

20:40.604 --> 20:42.827
Uh... so, Jesus, it's time
for you take your pills.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.309
Okay.

20:45.642 --> 20:47.325
I'm headed into work now.

20:47.445 --> 20:50.025
Hey, listen, did I see
Brandon here earlier?

20:50.074 --> 20:52.050
Oh, yeah, um, he was dropping the car

20:52.066 --> 20:53.793
so I could run errands later.

20:54.551 --> 20:55.874
- That's very nice of him.
- Mm-hm.

20:55.902 --> 20:57.523
- See you tonight.
- Yeah.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.205
Bye.

21:03.794 --> 21:05.203
Nice.

21:05.801 --> 21:07.422
Lookin' good, ladies.

21:07.464 --> 21:09.729
My house could use some pretty flowers.

21:10.371 --> 21:12.367
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:12.402 --> 21:14.133
I'm a neighbor from the next block over.

21:15.318 --> 21:16.502
Just being friendly.

21:18.183 --> 21:20.673
Oh... you might wanna
take in those cans.

21:20.707 --> 21:22.090
You don't wanna get a fine.

21:22.713 --> 21:24.243
Have a nice day, ladies.

21:27.651 --> 21:28.880
I got 'em.

22:17.846 --> 22:19.583
I folded your laundry for you.

22:23.711 --> 22:26.817
- You're welcome?
- Oh. Thank you.

22:28.269 --> 22:29.929
Hey, so...

22:30.049 --> 22:31.450
what's your big secret?

22:32.405 --> 22:34.138
Thought you didn't wanna know.

22:34.556 --> 22:37.039
I honestly don't know what to do.

22:37.302 --> 22:41.677
Well, Stef's right, you can't quit
and let Drew take over Anchor Beach.

22:41.680 --> 22:45.182
- Not after all you put into it.
- Well, I don't think you should, either.

22:45.218 --> 22:47.151
Resign, I mean, you
haven't yet, have you?

22:47.220 --> 22:48.964
Not officially.

22:49.241 --> 22:51.074
But they're offering
to pay out my contract

22:51.096 --> 22:52.635
if I don't make any trouble.

22:53.149 --> 22:56.618
And look, we both know my background's
in business, not education.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.766
Maybe Drew will be a better fit.

22:59.413 --> 23:01.743
They're trying to turn Anchor
Beach into a private school.

23:03.336 --> 23:04.675
Oh, hi.

23:05.317 --> 23:08.239
- Hi.
- Where did you hear that?

23:09.342 --> 23:10.568
I can't reveal my source.

23:10.573 --> 23:12.343
- Mariana?
- Jude.

23:12.704 --> 23:15.360
But I can't tell you in
what context he overheard

23:15.404 --> 23:17.667
Drew talking to some man
about raising $10 million

23:17.678 --> 23:20.838
- to create a new auditorium...
- Jude, get down here, please!

23:20.958 --> 23:24.091
Mama! I told you my
source in confidence!

23:26.454 --> 23:29.348
Okay, when and where did you
hear Drew talking to this man?

23:29.414 --> 23:31.910
Thanks a lot.

23:32.165 --> 23:34.202
You can still plead the Fifth.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.544
Hey.

23:42.164 --> 23:44.975
So I think Diamond took
something out of the trash.

23:45.011 --> 23:47.033
- Like what?
- I don't know,

23:47.060 --> 23:48.626
but there was this guy hanging around,

23:48.643 --> 23:51.138
and I think maybe he
left something for her?

23:51.258 --> 23:54.251
- Drugs?
- Okay, ladies, it's time for group.

23:54.287 --> 23:55.665
Everyone inside.

23:55.715 --> 23:59.072
I don't know what's worse,
slave labor or group therapy.

23:59.111 --> 24:02.108
- I like group.
- You would, Be-Aren't-Say.

24:02.228 --> 24:04.097
Did she take it inside?

24:04.297 --> 24:07.097
She didn't even go inside,
it's gotta be out here.

24:07.133 --> 24:09.967
So, maybe she buried it?

24:10.338 --> 24:11.710
Maybe.

24:12.501 --> 24:14.228
Wait, over here, over here.

24:19.379 --> 24:20.812
What?

24:20.868 --> 24:24.109
I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

24:25.593 --> 24:26.915
Wait.

24:30.999 --> 24:32.736
Rookie hiding place.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.228
What'd this guy look like?

24:37.263 --> 24:41.114
Um, black guy or Latino,
uh, not very tall.

24:41.141 --> 24:42.466
Lots of tattoos.

24:42.502 --> 24:45.295
What do you want us to do? Should
we give the phone to Cynthia?

24:45.345 --> 24:47.265
No no no, listen, I want
you to call me on it,

24:47.273 --> 24:49.063
so that the number comes up on my phone.

24:49.242 --> 24:53.308
Then I want you to delete the call
record and... and put it back, okay?

24:53.428 --> 24:55.919
- Put it back?
- Yeah. Listen.

24:57.629 --> 25:01.043
Listen, Callie, I want you to wipe
your fingerprints off of it first, okay?

25:04.639 --> 25:06.781
- Okay.
- I love you, baby.

25:06.814 --> 25:08.103
I love you, too.

25:08.136 --> 25:09.597
Oh my God.

25:15.401 --> 25:17.134
Have you told Emma you know?

25:18.007 --> 25:19.916
- Where's Jesus?
- Downstairs.

25:20.895 --> 25:22.726
I didn't tell her that you told me.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.445
Well, she's not stupid
and she's really upset,

25:26.461 --> 25:27.966
so what did you say to her?

25:28.149 --> 25:29.775
All I said was that she never thought

25:29.775 --> 25:31.391
about what Jesus would've wanted to do.

25:31.424 --> 25:33.172
Maybe he would've
wanted to keep the baby.

25:33.604 --> 25:36.053
You think Jesus is
capable of being a father?

25:36.512 --> 25:38.905
- I don't know.
- That's right, Mariana, you don't know.

25:38.907 --> 25:40.770
You have no idea what it's
like taking care of a kid.

25:40.890 --> 25:43.209
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot
that you were a step-dad

25:43.217 --> 25:44.541
for, like, five minutes.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.400
After everything that Ana
put you and Jesus through.

25:49.574 --> 25:51.394
At least she didn't get rid of us.

25:51.421 --> 25:53.611
Then why are you making
Emma feel worse for something

25:53.620 --> 25:55.339
that was really hard for her to do?

25:55.374 --> 25:57.394
Because this is exactly why
she didn't tell you, Mariana.

25:57.396 --> 26:00.092
Because you can't keep
secrets. You're a crappy friend.

26:00.317 --> 26:01.606
What's goin' on?

26:02.475 --> 26:03.692
Nothing.

26:06.569 --> 26:10.020
- Did I hear something about Emma?
- What? No.

26:10.056 --> 26:13.430
Uh, h... he's just mad because I...

26:14.044 --> 26:16.456
didn't fill up the car
when I used it last.

26:17.407 --> 26:19.553
Hey. Uh...

26:19.786 --> 26:22.591
don't say anything to anybody
about what you told me earlier.

26:22.906 --> 26:25.341
- What did she tell you?
- Well, some people might be trying

26:25.371 --> 26:27.237
to make Anchor Beach a private school.

26:27.273 --> 26:29.353
I don't know if it's
true, but nobody knows,

26:29.408 --> 26:31.682
so just don't spread it around, okay?

26:32.706 --> 26:33.935
Yeah. Okay.

26:33.996 --> 26:35.644
Jesus, can I talk to you for a sec?

26:36.010 --> 26:37.214
Yeah.

26:59.591 --> 27:00.836
What's up?

27:00.956 --> 27:03.273
So when did you stop taking
your anti-seizure meds?

27:07.271 --> 27:09.003
So your mama and I have discussed

27:09.003 --> 27:10.679
the legal strategy with your lawyers,

27:10.729 --> 27:15.675
and they think that using the DNA
report and Aaron's testimony...

27:15.795 --> 27:17.966
can only strengthen your case, but

27:17.982 --> 27:22.381
only to establish your state of
mind in the car, that at the time,

27:22.398 --> 27:24.489
you thought Troy had killed Martha.

27:24.609 --> 27:28.224
They still want you to say that
Kyle manipulated you and that

27:28.512 --> 27:31.023
you now believe he
was rightly convicted.

27:33.346 --> 27:35.012
I won't do it.

27:38.404 --> 27:40.894
There's something they told
us that you don't know, Cal.

27:41.014 --> 27:43.024
What?

27:43.041 --> 27:46.632
When Kyle was first
questioned about the murder,

27:46.660 --> 27:48.336
they did an illegal search on him,

27:48.358 --> 27:51.148
and they found an ATM receipt
that belonged to Martha,

27:51.170 --> 27:53.958
and it was dated the
morning of the murder.

27:54.078 --> 27:56.614
There was also $200 cash in his pocket.

27:56.647 --> 27:59.243
They couldn't use it in court,
but it establishes motive

27:59.260 --> 28:01.938
and places him at Martha's on that day.

28:02.635 --> 28:05.219
Well, are you sure it's not
a lie, it wasn't planted?

28:05.257 --> 28:06.841
Yes, love.

28:10.535 --> 28:13.993
I am sorry, I know... this is
really disappointing for you.

28:16.771 --> 28:19.836
- I wanna see him.
- He's been moved to Folsom,

28:19.856 --> 28:22.116
and that's a... that's a long way, love.

28:22.143 --> 28:24.323
I can ask Brandon to drive with me.

28:25.209 --> 28:28.895
Now, if they want me to say that I
think that Kyle killed Martha Johnson,

28:28.911 --> 28:30.531
I need to see him again.

28:36.387 --> 28:40.149
Hey, Brandon. We... we
are going to allow you

28:40.160 --> 28:42.489
- to drive with Callie to Folsom.
- Okay, cool.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.545
Should I be concerned, B?

28:45.549 --> 28:47.757
What? Seriously, Mom?

28:54.103 --> 28:57.484
In the past, when Callie has
been in emotional distress...

28:57.493 --> 29:00.343
Yeah, and you know what? This is
exactly why I moved in with Cortney,

29:00.389 --> 29:03.017
and... and practically divorced
myself from this family.

29:03.137 --> 29:04.627
So you and Mama wouldn't...

29:04.638 --> 29:06.946
get suspicious every time
I even looked at Callie.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.803
- Okay.
- We were friends.

29:08.982 --> 29:10.703
And now she's my sister.

29:10.823 --> 29:13.785
And... and I'm not gonna shut
her out of my life anymore, so...

29:14.051 --> 29:15.576
deal with it.

29:20.354 --> 29:21.637
Mouth open.

29:21.757 --> 29:22.943
Tongue up.

29:24.714 --> 29:26.086
How long are you gonna make me do this?

29:26.103 --> 29:27.840
Until I can trust that you'll take them,

29:27.960 --> 29:29.824
so probably forever.

29:31.253 --> 29:32.526
Hey, Gabe.

29:32.952 --> 29:34.734
Uh, I'm gonna run an errand,

29:34.789 --> 29:36.797
so I'll be back in about an hour.

29:43.222 --> 29:44.672
Hey, Brandon.

29:45.673 --> 29:48.290
- Do you want me to...
- No, it's... it's fine.

29:48.410 --> 29:50.520
I should've known I couldn't trust you.

29:51.948 --> 29:55.179
That's not true, but I
couldn't let you hurt yourself.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.789
I mean, your brain's not right.
You forgot what we were doin'.

29:57.801 --> 30:00.064
- You coulda had another seizure.
- What, my brain's not right?

30:00.108 --> 30:01.370
What about your brain?

30:01.490 --> 30:03.832
Y... you're so depressed
that y... you got evicted.

30:03.865 --> 30:05.893
M... m... maybe you
should take your meds.

30:08.573 --> 30:10.516
I wanna be here for you, Jesus.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.500
No, you don't.

30:12.917 --> 30:15.136
You almost left town without telling us.

30:15.418 --> 30:17.786
The only reason that you're here
right now is so that you have a...

30:17.814 --> 30:19.949
- a place to live.
- I had a job in Tahoe...

30:19.966 --> 30:21.869
Well, then maybe you should go!

30:21.989 --> 30:24.071
I'm sure it's still available!

30:29.129 --> 30:30.685
Talk about it later.

30:39.220 --> 30:41.455
You know, he... he... he did
the right thing, tellin' Mama.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.930
Don't need a lecture.

30:44.688 --> 30:46.514
I know you're going through...

30:46.774 --> 30:49.801
- a tough time with this TBI...
- I can't have sex...

30:50.299 --> 30:51.959
on my medication.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.942
I can't do anything on it.

31:04.286 --> 31:07.621
I don't... I don't wanna live like this.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.694
Hey.

31:15.075 --> 31:16.630
Don't say that.

31:16.935 --> 31:18.933
Okay? You're gonna get better.

31:19.984 --> 31:23.937
- And... and sex isn't... everything.
- That's easy for you to say.

31:24.524 --> 31:27.695
Okay, but... you can
talk to your doctor.

31:27.723 --> 31:29.877
Right? He can put you on something else

31:29.997 --> 31:33.167
- or give you something.
- Like what? Like... like Viagra?

31:33.195 --> 31:36.139
- Like I'm an old man or something?
- I don't know, I... I don't know.

31:36.167 --> 31:38.358
But I'm pretty sure that
you're not the first patient

31:38.391 --> 31:41.069
- to have this kind of problem.
- And what about Emma?

31:41.269 --> 31:42.857
She'll understand.

31:42.892 --> 31:45.397
I'm pretty sure everybody
knows that, like...

31:45.430 --> 31:48.108
she's not with me for my mind.

31:48.833 --> 31:51.156
You know, our thing,
it's... it's physical.

31:51.184 --> 31:54.635
- You know? It's...
- Jesus, there's nothing wrong with your mind.

31:56.396 --> 32:00.590
Okay, you have a TBI,
but... you're... funny,

32:00.710 --> 32:03.722
smart, and a really good guy.

32:05.277 --> 32:07.307
She has to love you for all of that.

32:08.591 --> 32:10.672
And you know, you c...
you could always, just...

32:11.363 --> 32:12.802
take care of her.

32:12.922 --> 32:15.496
You know, maybe learn a few things.

32:15.557 --> 32:16.757
What? Like what?

32:17.809 --> 32:21.206
I'm... not... just...

32:21.654 --> 32:22.971
ask her.

32:28.282 --> 32:30.671
Are you sure I'm gonna get better?

32:31.841 --> 32:33.240
I'm sure.

32:43.403 --> 32:45.655
Judy Chan, of course.

32:46.407 --> 32:48.172
So how many school board members

32:48.194 --> 32:49.942
do you think are coming
to this coup d'état?

32:49.966 --> 32:51.232
Did Kim say?

32:51.835 --> 32:54.574
Kim wasn't sure. She just
knew that it was happening.

32:54.694 --> 32:56.576
My friend at the SDDE said

32:56.615 --> 32:58.833
if they get two-thirds of
the parent and school board

32:58.841 --> 33:00.821
and prove they have the
funds to convert to private,

33:00.843 --> 33:02.785
the Department of
Education won't stop it.

33:02.962 --> 33:05.374
I wonder where this
money is coming from?

33:06.249 --> 33:09.247
Here come Mark and Mindy Kolchins.

33:10.119 --> 33:11.825
Why are we taking pictures?

33:11.830 --> 33:13.634
Isn't that what you do on a stakeout?

33:14.123 --> 33:16.588
- Is this a stakeout?
- Isn't it?

33:20.782 --> 33:21.962
Is that...

33:25.584 --> 33:27.360
That's Craig Stratos.

33:28.843 --> 33:30.171
Nick's dad.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.641
Why would he wanna bankroll this?

33:33.707 --> 33:35.644
His son doesn't even go
to Anchor Beach anymore.

33:35.845 --> 33:38.145
Maybe he's got a score to settle.

33:39.248 --> 33:40.801
Do you think this is personal?

33:45.847 --> 33:48.222
Wait.

34:00.036 --> 34:01.478
,

34:01.511 --> 34:03.003
What did you do to yourself?

34:03.271 --> 34:04.872
I needed protection.

34:05.681 --> 34:07.391
So you're in a gang.

34:08.043 --> 34:09.654
What are you doin' here?

34:11.801 --> 34:15.342
Did you steal money from Martha Johnson?

34:15.397 --> 34:17.818
$200 the day that she was killed?

34:19.601 --> 34:21.976
- Why didn't you tell me?
- They couldn't use it in court.

34:22.004 --> 34:25.108
- You said you weren't at her house that day.
- I lied.

34:25.456 --> 34:27.664
I was there in the morning,
I saw money on the counter,

34:27.697 --> 34:29.268
- and I took it.
- Why?

34:29.279 --> 34:30.862
Because I wanted stuff!

34:31.250 --> 34:33.900
And she never paid me good
for all the work I did for her.

34:36.138 --> 34:37.905
Oh my God, Kyle.

34:40.945 --> 34:42.511
Did you kill her?

34:44.685 --> 34:45.980
What if I did?

34:49.521 --> 34:50.851
You used me.

34:51.829 --> 34:53.030
You used me.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.878
- For what?
- For a cause.

34:54.998 --> 34:57.014
To... to feel good about yourself.

34:57.036 --> 34:59.742
I could go to prison
because I tried to help you.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.829
You're a white girl...
with a rich daddy.

35:04.379 --> 35:05.766
You ain't goin' to prison.

35:06.951 --> 35:08.650
You're gonna go to college.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.211
You're gonna get married,
you're gonna have babies.

35:10.244 --> 35:12.679
You have your whole life ahead of you.

35:13.564 --> 35:14.776
And me?

35:16.967 --> 35:18.516
I'm already dead.

35:20.669 --> 35:21.982
Don't come back here.

35:22.102 --> 35:23.851
I won't agree to see you again.

35:24.987 --> 35:27.320
Guard.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.931
I feel like... if I had just

35:44.119 --> 35:46.814
asked Emma myself if
she was pregnant and

35:46.847 --> 35:48.872
told her that I was hurt,

35:48.992 --> 35:51.346
I wouldn't have kept it
inside and lashed out.

35:51.887 --> 35:53.981
And I thought about what you said...

35:54.016 --> 35:57.366
about getting my power
back by talking to Ana about

35:57.382 --> 35:59.540
things that I've kept inside, so...

36:00.138 --> 36:01.956
And, Ana, how do you feel?

36:04.282 --> 36:06.395
I just wanna help Mariana feel better.

36:06.993 --> 36:10.396
Well... coming here with her
today is a meaningful gesture.

36:10.462 --> 36:11.799
Of course.

36:13.250 --> 36:14.534
So...

36:14.855 --> 36:16.170
Mariana.

36:20.559 --> 36:22.485
Do you remember leaving us...

36:22.605 --> 36:25.495
alone in our crib, when we were babies?

36:25.781 --> 36:26.983
What do you mean?

36:27.249 --> 36:29.235
I remember you leaving us

36:29.355 --> 36:32.500
for a long time, like...
longer than a day.

36:34.090 --> 36:35.538
I never did that.

36:36.252 --> 36:38.128
Jesus remembers, too.

36:39.163 --> 36:41.088
Well, I don't know how...

36:41.293 --> 36:44.939
you could remember something
like that when you were babies.

36:45.482 --> 36:47.972
We remember because we
were scared... and...

36:48.092 --> 36:50.092
hungry. And our diapers were full,

36:50.114 --> 36:52.205
- we were covered in our own...
- Okay, look, I...

36:52.792 --> 36:56.006
did a lotta things. I
never left you like that.

36:56.499 --> 37:00.195
Is it possible, Ana,
that... you don't remember?

37:00.499 --> 37:02.115
If you were using drugs?

37:04.678 --> 37:07.290
Look, I... I didn't
come here to be judged

37:07.295 --> 37:09.846
or ambushed by memories
that she dreamt up.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.176
I came here because I thought
that Mariana needed my help,

37:12.194 --> 37:15.029
not... not to make up
horrible things about me.

37:15.944 --> 37:19.099
No, I'm sorry, I... I...
I... I am not gonna do this.

37:39.604 --> 37:40.921
How'd it go?

37:42.769 --> 37:45.859
He has a teardrop tattoo under his eye.

37:46.996 --> 37:48.829
W... what does that mean?

37:50.033 --> 37:52.800
Means you killed someone.

37:58.793 --> 38:01.609
We've been tracking the texts
between Russell and Diamond.

38:01.614 --> 38:04.248
So that was last
night. Never heard back.

38:04.281 --> 38:06.113
You think he's on to us?

38:06.877 --> 38:08.332
I don't know.

38:08.863 --> 38:10.984
He's gonna be careful
what he texts, though.

38:11.492 --> 38:13.153
Man, I thought we had her.

38:13.189 --> 38:14.673
Well, maybe we still do.

38:14.706 --> 38:15.834
You know, it's all about,

38:15.954 --> 38:18.469
plantin' those seeds of hope
until one day they sprout.

38:18.496 --> 38:21.010
Gosh, I thought with what we told
her about Brandi, she'd be scared.

38:21.053 --> 38:23.510
Well, she is scared, that's
why she's talkin' to him.

38:23.548 --> 38:25.607
It doesn't mean she
really wants to go back.

38:25.657 --> 38:27.868
She just needs him to think she does.

38:30.039 --> 38:33.006
Excuse me. Hey, Gray?

38:34.156 --> 38:35.705
Detective.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.075
You know Doug Harvey?

38:39.374 --> 38:41.001
You came to my house.

38:41.121 --> 38:42.888
Can I talk to you for a minute?

38:43.092 --> 38:44.852
Why don't you go over
there and take a seat?

38:47.697 --> 38:49.069
What are you bringin' him in for?

38:49.113 --> 38:50.867
The prosecutor on your daughter's case

38:50.893 --> 38:52.732
is curious about how they got his DNA.

38:52.776 --> 38:55.195
And Mr. Harvey says that
Callie broke into his house.

38:55.231 --> 38:57.679
So you're not at all curious
about how Troy Johnson's DNA

38:57.696 --> 38:59.156
ended up on the murder weapon?

38:59.168 --> 39:01.103
He helped his grandmother
in the garden at some point,

39:01.107 --> 39:02.084
that's not hard to believe.

39:02.123 --> 39:05.105
Well, Doug Harvey over there's gonna
be hard for any jury to believe,

39:05.141 --> 39:08.350
and Callie got that DNA out of the
garbage, and that is not illegal.

39:08.815 --> 39:10.028
Let me give you a tip.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.892
Before your daughter gets on
the stand with that story...

39:13.623 --> 39:14.813
check that out.

39:45.311 --> 39:49.277
So you know it might...
it might be, like, a while

39:49.308 --> 39:51.556
- until I can...
- That's okay.

39:52.416 --> 39:53.787
I don't care about that.

39:55.354 --> 39:59.011
I mean, I do, but it's
not all that I care about.

40:10.206 --> 40:13.140
Well, you know, we can still do stuff.

40:13.175 --> 40:14.910
You know, for you?

40:14.958 --> 40:16.340
Hell, yeah.

40:18.269 --> 40:20.668
Oh my God. Did you
hear about Anchor Beach?

40:21.183 --> 40:22.389
- No.
- There's a rumor

40:22.407 --> 40:24.421
they're turning into a private school.

40:24.598 --> 40:26.409
_

40:26.480 --> 40:27.887
Where did you hear that from?

40:28.007 --> 40:30.991
Frannie sent me a screen chat from
some anonymous Twitter account.

40:32.287 --> 40:34.155
Does your mom know about this?

40:35.580 --> 40:38.466
We might not be able
to graduate from ABCC.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.782
_

40:46.606 --> 40:48.965
_

40:52.099 --> 40:54.569
_

40:54.578 --> 40:56.947
_

40:56.986 --> 40:58.850
Did she say anything?

41:15.344 --> 41:16.508
Who?

41:17.128 --> 41:18.389
Your mom.

41:18.810 --> 41:19.898
Does she know?
