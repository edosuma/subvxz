Mal:
Okay, so, I'm excited

00:17.384 --> 00:19.551
and confused
all at the same time.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.987
What is this whole
Jewel-bilee thing anyway?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.688
Imagine Cinderella's ball,

00:23.723 --> 00:25.223
The Festival of Fools,

00:25.258 --> 00:27.259
and the Mad Hatter's
Tea Party all mixed together

00:27.294 --> 00:28.493
times six!

00:28.528 --> 00:31.396
Yes, Ally. You imagine
that all you like.

00:31.431 --> 00:34.166
The Jewel-bilee
is a dignified ceremony

00:34.201 --> 00:36.435
where each of us were given
our birthright jewels.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.569
Once we showed we were good.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.538
No grades.
It's pass/fail.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.541
Well, we all got our jewels
years ago.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.742
-(beeps)
-See?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.946
-Mal: Whoa.
-Awkward.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.014
(chuckling)

00:49.049 --> 00:51.049
And now, for the first time,

00:51.084 --> 00:53.185
they're releasing jewels
for the VKs.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.453
Releasing?

00:54.488 --> 00:56.755
Well, yes. When the villains
were relocated,

00:56.790 --> 00:57.956
their jewels
were collected...

00:57.991 --> 00:59.758
Translation: stolen.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.593
...so that they could
be held safely.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.062
And now, Auradon
will bestow them upon you

01:04.097 --> 01:05.797
at the majestic Jewel-bilee.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.799
They're giving us
our own jewels?

01:07.834 --> 01:09.068
How generous.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.472
-(chuckling)
-What?

01:13.507 --> 01:14.272
(gasps)

01:14.307 --> 01:15.307
Huh?

01:15.342 --> 01:16.608
Oh!

01:16.643 --> 01:17.742
Oh, snap!

01:17.777 --> 01:19.945
Who's the rarest of them all?

01:21.114 --> 01:22.414
Seriously?

01:22.449 --> 01:24.082
(laughing)

01:24.117 --> 01:26.218
Looking good, green face.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.285
Oh, dear.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.121
Oops. I bibbidied the tea.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.822
It was supposed
to be a surprise...

01:30.857 --> 01:32.591
to give us
a healthy glow.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.996
Eh. It's okay, Jane.
I look fierce.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.898
Hey, maybe I'll even
match my jewel.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.300
Uh, wait,
you didn't tell her?

01:42.335 --> 01:43.668
Nobody told her?

01:43.703 --> 01:46.905
Maleficent hid your jewel
somewhere on the isle.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.474
Everyone looked,
but it was never found.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.409
So you're not getting one, Mal.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.312
(sighs)
Two inches tall,
shoved in a jar,

01:54.347 --> 01:56.481
and my mom is
still ruining my life.

01:56.516 --> 02:00.418
I know. It really puts a damper
on the whole celebration.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.420
Ugh.

02:02.455 --> 02:06.124
So... (chuckles)
thanks to my mom,

02:06.159 --> 02:08.360
I'm an outsider... again.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.995
But you know what?
Not this time.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.531
I am going back to the isle
and I'm gonna find that jewel.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.167
Well, okay.
Then I'm going with.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.334
No, Evie.

02:16.369 --> 02:17.636
I don't want you
to get in trouble.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.938
Oh, but it's okay for you?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.774
I'm the daughter of the most
evil villain in the world.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.077
You know?
I'm always in trouble.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.547
I am getting that jewel
and nobody--

02:28.582 --> 02:31.049
not even my mother--
is going to stop me.
