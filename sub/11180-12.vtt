WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:04.142
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.280 --> 00:07.041
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.179 --> 00:11.701
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.839 --> 00:14.635
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.773 --> 00:17.569
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.707 --> 00:21.711
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.368 --> 00:25.784
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.922 --> 00:28.476
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.614 --> 00:31.031
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.169 --> 00:33.792
Just to get up that hill

00:33.930 --> 00:36.312
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.450 --> 00:38.900
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.039 --> 00:41.386
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.524 --> 00:43.146
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.284 --> 00:45.907
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.046 --> 00:48.945
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.083 --> 00:53.501
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.639 --> 00:56.366
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.504 --> 00:59.404
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.542 --> 01:05.410
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:11.519 --> 01:13.625
Needs a little
more nutmeg.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.771
A little more rum.

01:23.738 --> 01:25.568
Some for my mammy...

01:26.810 --> 01:28.536
Some for my pappy...

01:29.675 --> 01:32.092
A little bit more
and we'll all be happy.

01:39.651 --> 01:42.102
Mmm, Satan,
turn me loose!

01:44.587 --> 01:46.140
Florence!
Yes, ma'am.

01:46.278 --> 01:48.177
Could I borrow
your finger for
a minute?

01:48.315 --> 01:50.075
You want one with
eggnog or without?

01:50.731 --> 01:53.009
Without.
Okay.

01:53.147 --> 01:56.702
I wanna finish wrapping
George's present before
he gets home.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.704
That looks like
some present!

01:58.842 --> 02:01.431
Oh, no. I just put it
in a big box to fool him.

02:01.569 --> 02:03.537
See how light it is.

02:03.675 --> 02:05.711
What did you get him?
A fresh supply of hot air?

02:07.161 --> 02:10.164
Every Christmas,
George guesses
what his gift is.

02:10.302 --> 02:13.616
But he's gonna need
a crystal ball to figure
it out this year.

02:13.754 --> 02:15.756
That ain't gonna
do him no good.
Why not?

02:15.894 --> 02:18.172
A crystal ball
is for seeing
into the future,

02:18.310 --> 02:20.140
not the present.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.316
Get it? Present,

02:24.454 --> 02:26.180
Like a Christmas
present.

02:29.908 --> 02:31.151
Okay. What
did you get him?

02:32.635 --> 02:34.154
I got him
a smoking jacket.

02:34.292 --> 02:36.121
He'll really
be surprised.

02:36.846 --> 02:39.366
And I got his
favorite color.

02:39.504 --> 02:40.953
Red.

02:41.091 --> 02:42.127
What's red?

02:42.265 --> 02:43.335
Red...

02:43.473 --> 02:45.337
Nosed Reindeer

02:45.475 --> 02:48.064
Had a very shiny nose

02:48.202 --> 02:50.860
BOTH:
And if you ever saw it

02:50.998 --> 02:53.380
You would even say
it glows...

02:53.518 --> 02:55.347
Hi, George!

02:55.485 --> 02:58.730
All of the
other reindeer
Florence...

02:58.868 --> 03:00.490
Used to laugh
and call him names

03:00.628 --> 03:02.458
Florence, would you
knock it off?

03:02.596 --> 03:04.529
What's the matter with you?
Don't you like singing?

03:04.667 --> 03:07.152
Oh, yeah. I love singing,
but I don't like what
you were doing.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.430
Here, Weez.

03:09.568 --> 03:11.052
I got something
for us to hang on
our Christmas tree.

03:11.501 --> 03:13.676
Oh, an angel!

03:13.814 --> 03:15.505
Ain't it nice?
It's black.

03:17.542 --> 03:18.922
I can see that.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.270
And I'm naming it
Weezy, after you.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.376
Because you're my
little black angel.

03:26.344 --> 03:29.209
Oh, my. You're sure
in a good mood!

03:29.347 --> 03:31.211
Why shouldn't I be?
It's Christmas Eve.

03:31.349 --> 03:33.661
Would the man of the house
like some eggnog?

03:33.799 --> 03:35.663
Why, thank you, Florence.
What about the lady?

03:35.801 --> 03:37.217
I already got some.

03:41.048 --> 03:43.223
Whoo! What did you
put in this?

03:43.361 --> 03:45.086
Brown eggs, baby.
The best.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.433
Mmm!

03:46.571 --> 03:48.469
They must have come
from a wino chicken.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.473
Whose present is this?

03:53.129 --> 03:54.510
It's for you,
George.

03:54.648 --> 03:57.029
From me.
Oh, yeah?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.756
Don't even try,
George.

03:59.894 --> 04:02.103
You will never
guess what I got
you this year.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.244
A red smoking jacket.

04:06.315 --> 04:07.937
George, how
in the world?

04:08.075 --> 04:10.146
Weezy, you know
you can't keep no
secrets from me.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.494
And I thought
I had it hidden where
you'd never find it.

04:13.632 --> 04:15.807
Yeah, well, next year,
hide the receipt too.

04:15.945 --> 04:17.498
You charged it
to my account.

04:17.636 --> 04:19.120
Oh!

04:19.259 --> 04:22.123
George, you are terrible.
You ruined my surprise!

04:22.262 --> 04:23.780
Well, get me
another surprise.
We can afford it.

04:23.918 --> 04:26.507
I mean, this is not like
our first Christmas
together, remember?

04:26.645 --> 04:27.819
Oh, yes.

04:27.957 --> 04:29.476
What happened then?

04:29.614 --> 04:31.167
Instead of giving
each other presents,

04:31.305 --> 04:32.996
we took the
last cent we had

04:33.134 --> 04:35.447
and bought ourselves
a used toaster.

04:35.585 --> 04:37.346
It was two weeks
before we had any toast.

04:38.381 --> 04:39.934
You mean the toaster
didn't work?

04:40.072 --> 04:42.730
No, we didn't have
any money left
to buy bread.

04:43.869 --> 04:46.009
And remember our first
Christmas tree?

04:46.147 --> 04:48.080
We had to wait till
Christmas Eve to buy it

04:48.218 --> 04:49.772
so we could get it
for half-price.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.015
And you know
what we got
for half-price?

04:52.153 --> 04:53.223
Half a tree.

04:54.535 --> 04:58.090
We put one
ornament on it
and it fell over!

04:58.228 --> 05:00.230
Well, at least y'all
could afford to buy a tree.

05:00.369 --> 05:01.715
When I was
a little girl,

05:01.853 --> 05:04.096
my daddy had to
go down to Central
Park every year

05:04.234 --> 05:05.546
and chop down
our Christmas tree.

05:08.169 --> 05:11.449
Florence, there aren't
any Christmas trees
in Central Park.

05:11.587 --> 05:13.347
Because my daddy
chopped them all down.

05:19.733 --> 05:22.874
Yeah, Weez, we
sure have come
a long way.

05:23.012 --> 05:24.876
I mean, this place is
a thousand times better

05:25.014 --> 05:25.946
than our apartment
in H arlem.

05:26.084 --> 05:28.535
Ten thousand times.

05:28.673 --> 05:31.710
I can remember
Lionel's first
Christmas.

05:31.848 --> 05:34.299
The three of us there
in that one room.

05:34.437 --> 05:36.163
The pipes
were frozen.

05:36.301 --> 05:37.785
We didn't
have any heat.

05:37.923 --> 05:39.442
Yeah, that skinny
little turkey.

05:41.237 --> 05:43.170
We had enough turkey
for the three of us.

05:43.308 --> 05:44.344
Oh, I don't mean
that turkey.

05:44.482 --> 05:45.793
I'm talking about
that jive landlord

05:45.931 --> 05:47.381
that turned off
our heat.
Oh!

05:47.519 --> 05:49.003
Where is Lionel?

05:49.141 --> 05:51.558
Oh, he and Jenny
went to pick up their
marriage license.

05:51.696 --> 05:53.801
Oh.
Isn't it sad?

05:53.939 --> 05:55.803
I've been telling
you that all along,
Weez.

05:57.287 --> 05:58.841
I don't mean
that, George.

05:58.979 --> 06:00.498
It's just hard
to believe

06:00.636 --> 06:03.949
that this is Lionel's
last Christmas at home.

06:05.779 --> 06:07.021
In two weeks,

06:07.159 --> 06:09.334
our little boy
will be married.

06:09.472 --> 06:10.439
Weezy!

06:12.717 --> 06:15.685
And then it'll
only be you
and me, George.

06:15.823 --> 06:17.963
Aww! I'll still be here!

06:19.931 --> 06:22.209
Don't remind me
or I'll start crying.

06:24.729 --> 06:25.868
Hi, Florence.

06:26.006 --> 06:27.766
Hi, Mrs. Willis.
Come on in and
have some eggnog.

06:27.904 --> 06:28.871
Oh, thank you!

06:29.009 --> 06:30.804
Hi, everybody.

06:30.942 --> 06:33.047
Mrs. Jefferson,
get Mrs. Willis
some eggnog.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.466
Why don't you get it?

06:37.604 --> 06:39.502
I can't. I'm coming
down with something.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.816
Yeah, a case
of the drunks.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.785
You shouldn't have had
so much eggnog, Florence.

06:46.923 --> 06:48.718
Yeah, this nutmeg
will kill you.

06:50.548 --> 06:52.032
Well, I'm gonna
take a little nap.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.620
I got a church social
to go to tonight,

06:53.758 --> 06:55.415
and I'm gonna have
to look pretty.

06:55.553 --> 06:57.555
Yeah, well, you're
gonna have to take
a long nap for that.

07:00.661 --> 07:03.940
Lord, you know I want
to tell him something.

07:04.078 --> 07:05.804
But I know you
don't want me
to talk like that

07:05.942 --> 07:07.392
on the day before
your birthday.

07:11.500 --> 07:15.227
Oh, Louise,
we got some more
RSVPs today.

07:15.365 --> 07:16.574
The Stones,
the Hutchisons,

07:16.712 --> 07:18.058
the Macphersons
and the Millers

07:18.196 --> 07:19.266
are all coming
to the wedding.

07:19.404 --> 07:20.992
I don't know
none of them.

07:21.130 --> 07:22.614
They're friends
of ours.

07:22.752 --> 07:24.374
Huh! Let me
see that list.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.344
Where's Rooster Carter?

07:31.485 --> 07:33.867
I think he still
lives in the Bronx.

07:34.005 --> 07:35.800
I mean, how come
he ain't on this list?

07:36.766 --> 07:38.665
You and Rooster
haven't seen
each other

07:38.803 --> 07:41.530
since you had that
fight 10 years ago.

07:41.668 --> 07:43.152
Well, can you think
of a better time to
patch things up

07:43.290 --> 07:44.325
than at a wedding?

07:45.326 --> 07:47.121
Bubba Banks
ain't on here either.

07:48.606 --> 07:50.642
George, I asked
you to go over

07:50.780 --> 07:52.955
the guest list with me
a couple of weeks ago,

07:53.093 --> 07:54.853
but you said
you were too busy.

07:54.991 --> 07:56.061
Yeah, well,
I ain't too busy now.

07:56.199 --> 07:57.442
I just wanna make
sure the Willises

07:57.580 --> 07:59.824
ain't inviting just
all of their friends.

07:59.962 --> 08:02.447
Well, we had to draw
the line somewhere.

08:02.585 --> 08:05.415
The reception hall
only holds so many people.

08:05.554 --> 08:06.624
Oh, that reminds
me, Louise.

08:06.762 --> 08:08.453
We found a band to
play at the reception.

08:08.591 --> 08:09.765
The leader's
a friend of Tom's,

08:09.903 --> 08:12.250
and he is a marvelous
accordion player.

08:12.388 --> 08:13.838
Accordion player?

08:13.976 --> 08:15.046
At a wedding reception?

08:15.184 --> 08:16.530
You gotta be jiving.

08:17.566 --> 08:19.568
What's wrong
with an accordion?

08:19.706 --> 08:21.535
Nothing, if you're
Lawrence Welk.

08:22.950 --> 08:24.780
Are you gonna rent
a bubble machine too?

08:26.022 --> 08:27.403
Get off it,
George.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.508
No, you get off it!

08:28.646 --> 08:30.371
You can't dance
to no accordion music.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.235
I want some music
you can get down to.

08:33.443 --> 08:35.376
This is a wedding
reception, George,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.068
not Soul Train.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.832
Ho, ho, ho!
Have you been
a good little girl?

08:42.970 --> 08:44.282
Oh, I'm sorry, Santa.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.870
You must have
the wrong apartment.

08:46.008 --> 08:47.285
No, it's me. Tom.

08:48.217 --> 08:49.908
Tom?

08:50.046 --> 08:52.152
What are you doing
dressed like that?

08:52.290 --> 08:53.740
Tom was at
children's hospital

08:53.878 --> 08:55.155
distributing toys
to the kids.

08:55.293 --> 08:56.846
He does it every year.

08:56.984 --> 08:59.435
Helen, I couldn't
get into our apartment.
I forgot my key.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.092
Why didn't you
slide down the chimney?

09:03.370 --> 09:06.960
Ho, ho, ho!
That's very funny,
little boy!

09:07.098 --> 09:08.651
Who you calling "boy"?

09:12.310 --> 09:14.139
Ho, ho, ho,
little man!

09:15.209 --> 09:18.040
Tell Santa
what you want
for Christmas.

09:18.178 --> 09:19.869
How about your
two front teeth?

09:21.215 --> 09:23.735
Oh, what's that
you've got there,
little girl?

09:23.873 --> 09:25.634
Your Christmas list?
Ho, ho!

09:25.772 --> 09:29.465
Come right over here
and sit on Santa's lap

09:29.603 --> 09:32.606
and tell Santa
what you want
for Christmas.

09:33.952 --> 09:35.505
Well, if you really
want to know,

09:35.644 --> 09:36.748
I'd like someone else

09:36.886 --> 09:38.923
to handle
the arrangements
for Jenny's wedding.

09:39.061 --> 09:41.857
Oh, are you
having problems?

09:45.515 --> 09:46.965
Well, things are
pretty hectic,

09:47.103 --> 09:48.691
but there's one
bright note.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.106
Leonard phoned
from Boston

09:50.244 --> 09:51.521
to say that he'll
be at the wedding.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.489
Leonard can make it?
Oh, that's great, Helen!

09:53.627 --> 09:54.870
Isn't that
great, George?

09:55.008 --> 09:55.940
Yeah, sure.

09:56.078 --> 09:57.286
Who's Leonard?

09:57.424 --> 10:00.254
He's the minister
who's gonna perform
the ceremony.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.119
Leonard is Tom's
favorite nephew.

10:03.257 --> 10:04.983
Tom's favorite nephew?

10:05.121 --> 10:06.398
Well, I like him too.

10:06.536 --> 10:07.572
That ain't
what I mean.

10:07.710 --> 10:08.780
Well, what
do you mean?

10:08.918 --> 10:10.368
I mean,
is he like you?

10:12.301 --> 10:14.510
No, Leonard's
much shorter.

10:15.476 --> 10:17.375
That ain't
what I mean neither.

10:17.513 --> 10:19.722
Uh, then what
do you mean,
George?

10:19.860 --> 10:23.174
I mean I don't want
my son being married
by no honky minister.

10:24.693 --> 10:26.833
George, marriages
are made in heaven,

10:26.971 --> 10:29.387
and god doesn't care
what color a minister is.

10:29.525 --> 10:30.975
Okay, when his
son gets married,

10:31.113 --> 10:33.494
he can pick whatever
color preacher he wants.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.670
My son is black,
and I want him married
by a black preacher.

10:36.808 --> 10:38.810
George...
Don't be
George-ing me, Weezy!

10:38.948 --> 10:41.123
I knew you was gonna
try and pull something
like this, Willis.

10:41.261 --> 10:42.676
What are you
talking about?

10:44.471 --> 10:46.438
An accordion player,
a white minister...

10:46.576 --> 10:48.061
You've been sneaking
around behind my back

10:48.199 --> 10:50.166
planning a
lily-white wedding.

10:53.963 --> 10:55.309
Hmm...

10:56.207 --> 10:58.450
Oh, shucks.
We're here already.

10:58.588 --> 11:01.453
Mmm. Time flies
when you're having fun.

11:01.591 --> 11:04.836
Oh, I hope time flies
for the next two weeks.

11:04.974 --> 11:07.943
Just think,
in two weeks I'll be
Mrs. Lionel Jefferson!

11:09.876 --> 11:11.671
I wanna tell
the whole world!

11:11.809 --> 11:13.258
Oh, you're gonna
get your chance,

11:13.396 --> 11:15.398
because the whole
world's gonna be
at our wedding.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.265
I wish we were having
a small wedding
like we wanted.

11:20.403 --> 11:21.784
Yeah. Me too.

11:21.922 --> 11:22.958
But, you know, Jenny,

11:23.096 --> 11:24.856
if a big wedding means
that much to our folks,

11:24.994 --> 11:26.720
we might as well let them
have their fun, huh?

11:30.413 --> 11:31.898
Wait,
wait, wait!

11:32.036 --> 11:33.623
They're probably
all excited, waiting
for us to come home,

11:33.762 --> 11:35.625
so let's give them
a big entrance.

11:35.764 --> 11:37.800
Yeah!

11:40.009 --> 11:40.838
BOTH: Ta-da!

11:40.976 --> 11:41.977
I don't wanna
hear it!

11:42.115 --> 11:43.426
So you can
just call your
accordion player

11:43.564 --> 11:45.187
and your white minister
and tell them to forget it.

11:45.325 --> 11:47.396
Oh, no!

11:47.534 --> 11:50.192
This is one thing
you are not going
to run.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.712
The bride's
parents make all
the arrangements.

11:52.850 --> 11:55.197
It's our responsibility,
not yours.

11:55.335 --> 11:56.439
What's going on?

11:56.577 --> 11:57.889
Your father's trying
to mess up the wedding,

11:58.027 --> 11:59.063
but I'm not
gonna let him.

11:59.201 --> 12:00.616
Me? I'm not
messing it up!

12:00.754 --> 12:02.342
I'm the one who
did all the work!

12:02.480 --> 12:03.861
I'm the one who did
all the planning!

12:03.999 --> 12:05.034
Look, daddy, please.
Yeah!

12:05.172 --> 12:06.760
And you the one
who planned it
all wrong!

12:06.898 --> 12:08.072
Now, look, pop.

12:08.210 --> 12:09.383
The kind of wedding
Jenny and I really want...

12:09.521 --> 12:10.591
You two stay
out of this!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.628
This wedding
is none of your
business!

12:21.741 --> 12:22.914
Hold on, pop.
What do you mean

12:23.052 --> 12:24.364
this is none
of our business?

12:24.502 --> 12:26.366
Jenny and I are
the ones who are
getting married.

12:26.504 --> 12:28.333
Yeah, well,
who do you think
is paying for it?

12:28.471 --> 12:30.128
I am.

12:30.266 --> 12:32.199
Yeah, well, money
ain't no big thing.

12:33.891 --> 12:34.857
But, Mr. Jefferson...

12:34.995 --> 12:36.065
No buts! You
just butt out!

12:36.203 --> 12:38.861
All you and Lionel
have to do is show up.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.138
That's ridiculous.
Why can't we have

12:40.276 --> 12:42.520
some say over
our own wedding?

12:42.658 --> 12:43.866
Have you ever
been married before?

12:44.833 --> 12:46.351
Well, no,
of course not.

12:46.489 --> 12:48.422
Then how you gonna
know what to do?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.666
Now, I have been
where you are going.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.427
And I wish you
would go back there.

12:59.330 --> 13:01.642
Pop, why are you
acting like this?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.196
Lionel, look,
you black, ain't you?

13:03.334 --> 13:04.369
Of course,
but what...

13:04.507 --> 13:06.613
And Jenny looks
black, don't she?

13:08.270 --> 13:09.754
Pop!

13:09.892 --> 13:11.652
It's only natural
that you should have
a black wedding.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.241
But why does
the minister have
to be black?

13:14.379 --> 13:15.415
Well, one reason.

13:15.553 --> 13:17.244
White ministers
don't know how
to preach.

13:19.143 --> 13:20.454
What about
Oral Roberts?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.215
He's only good
if you're sick.

13:24.182 --> 13:26.426
George, my nephew
is a terrific preacher.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.428
He's one of the
most prominent
Episcopalian ministers

13:28.566 --> 13:29.912
in the country.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.707
Episcopalian?

13:34.537 --> 13:36.608
Yes. What's wrong
with Episcopalian?

13:36.746 --> 13:38.921
It ain't Baptist,
that's what's
wrong with it.

13:39.059 --> 13:42.407
Oh, so now the
minister has to be black
and Baptist, huh?

13:42.545 --> 13:43.546
That's right. You got it.

13:43.684 --> 13:44.616
Why?

13:44.754 --> 13:45.755
Because the
Baptist church

13:45.894 --> 13:48.344
is the one I have
followed all of my life.

13:48.482 --> 13:51.589
Then how come
nobody can ever get
you to go to church?

13:51.727 --> 13:54.350
I said "follow,"
not "go to."

13:58.527 --> 14:00.046
Hey, listen.

14:00.184 --> 14:02.255
CAROLERS:
Glory to
the newborn king...

14:02.393 --> 14:04.084
Oh, it sounds
like carolers.

14:04.222 --> 14:06.155
Carolers? What the hell
are they doing here now?

14:08.019 --> 14:09.400
George the Baptist

14:09.538 --> 14:11.436
doesn't even know
it's Christmas eve.

14:16.407 --> 14:20.169
Join the triumph
of the skies

14:20.307 --> 14:24.070
With the angelic
host proclaim

14:24.208 --> 14:28.143
Christ is born
in Bethlehem

14:28.281 --> 14:32.112
Hark! the herald
angels sing

14:36.358 --> 14:37.359
Oh!

14:38.947 --> 14:41.294
That... That
was beautiful.

14:41.984 --> 14:43.089
Thank you.

14:43.227 --> 14:44.918
It sounded like
a host of seraphim.

14:45.056 --> 14:46.886
You don't know
your Christmas music
too well, Bentley.

14:47.024 --> 14:48.991
That was 'Hark,
The Herald Angels Sing.'

14:51.200 --> 14:52.650
Uh, let's have
another song.

14:52.788 --> 14:54.790
Sure.
Yeah, rev,
that was dynamite.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.343
Oh, thank you.

15:01.590 --> 15:07.423
I'm dreaming
of a white Christmas...

15:09.391 --> 15:10.737
Do you mind singing
another song?

15:10.875 --> 15:12.842
This happens
to be one of our
most requested...

15:14.430 --> 15:15.638
Cut!

15:17.709 --> 15:19.332
Uh, number 16, gang.

15:19.470 --> 15:21.575
Mr. Jefferson,
thank you.

15:21.713 --> 15:22.714
How'd you know
my name?

15:22.852 --> 15:24.026
Mr. Hart told me.

15:24.164 --> 15:25.959
He said you were
a very charitable,
generous soul.

15:26.097 --> 15:27.167
Who's Mr. Hart?

15:27.305 --> 15:29.169
At your service, sir.

15:29.307 --> 15:31.068
Ralph! I didn't know
your last name was Hart.

15:31.206 --> 15:32.655
I thought it was
handout.

15:33.898 --> 15:35.969
That's very funny,
Mr. Jefferson.

15:36.107 --> 15:37.281
And it reminds me, sir.

15:37.419 --> 15:38.523
Tomorrow is
Christmas...

15:38.661 --> 15:40.594
Yeah, I know, Ralph.
And I won't
be here, sir.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.217
Oh. Merry
Christmas, Ralph.

15:42.355 --> 15:43.839
I'm sorry I didn't
have a chance to get
you a gift, but...

15:43.977 --> 15:46.566
Oh, sir, I wasn't
talking about
a gift for me.

15:46.704 --> 15:47.877
Say what?

15:48.016 --> 15:49.776
I was talking about
a gift for you.

15:49.914 --> 15:52.468
Now, don't
say no, sir.

15:52.606 --> 15:54.505
I feel very strongly
about this.

15:55.540 --> 15:58.060
My gift to you
is going to be

15:58.198 --> 16:00.821
that you don't have
to give a gift to me.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.377
That's my gift to you.

16:04.515 --> 16:06.413
Oh, wow, that's really
nice of you, Ralph.

16:06.551 --> 16:07.794
It's too bad, though,

16:07.932 --> 16:09.830
because I was
gonna give you this
brand-new $20 bill.

16:09.969 --> 16:10.935
Twenty?

16:11.073 --> 16:12.040
Oh, you don't
know how bad

16:12.178 --> 16:13.248
I feel about
this, Ralph.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.388
Well, if it means
that much to you, sir,

16:15.526 --> 16:17.666
my feelings
are not important.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.463
Thank you,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.

16:22.947 --> 16:26.951
Reverend, I'd like
to make a donation.

16:27.089 --> 16:28.918
TOM: Oh, wow.

16:29.057 --> 16:31.369
Oh, that's very
generous. Thank you.

16:31.507 --> 16:33.199
I'll just
take my change.

16:34.855 --> 16:39.895
This five and this little
ten right over there.

16:40.723 --> 16:45.107
Shepherds quake

16:45.245 --> 16:47.661
At the sight...

16:51.113 --> 16:52.390
Merry Christmas.
LOUISE: Merry Christmas.

16:52.528 --> 16:53.736
Merry Christmas.
GEORGE: Merry Christmas.

16:53.874 --> 16:55.945
Merry Christmas.
God bless all of you.

16:56.084 --> 16:57.878
Merry Christmas.
ALL: Merry Christmas.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.019
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas.

17:00.157 --> 17:02.297
Merry Christmas.

17:02.435 --> 17:03.712
Merry Christmas.

17:03.850 --> 17:06.956
Mr. Willis, you
make a splendid
father Christmas.

17:07.095 --> 17:09.166
A who?
Father Christmas.

17:09.304 --> 17:11.168
That's what the British
call Santa Claus.

17:11.306 --> 17:12.410
Yes, isn't it
interesting

17:12.548 --> 17:14.033
how each country
has a different
name for him?

17:14.171 --> 17:15.206
No.

17:15.344 --> 17:16.587
For instance,
in France

17:16.725 --> 17:18.382
he's known as
Pere Noel,

17:18.520 --> 17:21.040
while in Italy
they call him
Babbo Natale.

17:21.178 --> 17:22.731
Sounds like
a boxer.

17:22.869 --> 17:24.043
Yes, it does,
doesn't it?

17:24.181 --> 17:26.010
But you'll never
guess what the
Danish call him.

17:26.148 --> 17:27.218
That's right, I won't.

17:27.356 --> 17:29.048
Julemanden.

17:29.186 --> 17:31.222
Ah, but the most
fascinating of all...

17:31.360 --> 17:32.844
You wanna hear
something fascinating,
Bentley?

17:32.982 --> 17:35.054
You know what
they call Santa Claus
back in the ghetto?

17:35.192 --> 17:36.469
No. What do
they call him?

17:36.607 --> 17:38.954
"Absent," because
he's never there.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.680
Merry Christmas,
bentley.
Merry...

17:45.064 --> 17:46.996
Wasn't that
singing nice?

17:47.135 --> 17:49.137
Mmm, yeah, there's
nothing like carolers

17:49.275 --> 17:50.897
to put you in the
Christmas spirit.

17:51.035 --> 17:55.281
You know, George,
maybe we can compromise
on the wedding.

17:55.419 --> 17:56.937
Compromise?
How do you mean?

17:57.076 --> 18:01.183
I'll hire a band
to play both regular
music and soul music.

18:01.321 --> 18:03.703
Hey, hey, that
sounds like a
great idea, Willis.

18:03.841 --> 18:06.499
And just to show you
that I'm willing to
meet you halfway,

18:06.637 --> 18:08.708
I just happen to know
a great black minister.

18:08.846 --> 18:10.330
Hold it, George.
What about our
compromise?

18:10.468 --> 18:11.849
We are compromising.
You're hiring the band,

18:11.987 --> 18:13.195
I'm hiring
the minister.

18:13.333 --> 18:14.783
I've already
promised my nephew.

18:14.921 --> 18:15.991
Look, Willis.
When I look
in that altar,

18:16.129 --> 18:17.510
I don't wanna be
seeing no nephews.

18:17.648 --> 18:18.890
I wanna see a brother.

18:19.028 --> 18:22.101
Oh, now, come on,
Mr. Jefferson.

18:22.239 --> 18:24.413
Pop, why do you have
to argue like this
on Christmas eve?

18:24.551 --> 18:25.966
This is supposed
to be a time of

18:26.105 --> 18:28.141
loving and understanding,
not fighting.

18:28.279 --> 18:30.626
Yeah, you're right.
I'm finished fighting.

18:30.764 --> 18:32.007
Give me that list.

18:34.285 --> 18:35.873
George, what are
you doing?

18:36.011 --> 18:37.840
If Willis insists
on having the
wedding his way,

18:37.978 --> 18:40.533
then I would just
like to scratch
one guest. Me.

18:40.671 --> 18:41.982
Now, wait a
minute, George.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.639
I wouldn't care
if you painted
everybody black

18:43.777 --> 18:44.813
and got reverend
Ike to preach,

18:44.951 --> 18:46.711
I'm not going
to the wedding.

18:46.849 --> 18:48.299
George, you're nothing
but a crybaby!

18:48.437 --> 18:50.129
Crybaby? Who are
you calling crybaby?

18:52.476 --> 18:54.443
Crybaby.

18:54.581 --> 18:55.789
Where do you
think you're going?

18:55.927 --> 18:57.550
Where I don't have
to listen to you.

18:57.688 --> 18:59.552
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not running away
from me this time.

18:59.690 --> 19:01.140
GEORGE: Get out!
Open this door!

19:03.763 --> 19:05.489
This is
ridiculous.

19:05.627 --> 19:08.077
Can you believe
two grown men
acting like that?

19:08.216 --> 19:09.458
What grown men?

19:09.596 --> 19:13.082
They get upset and
they run to the potty.

19:15.602 --> 19:17.259
You know,
I wish city hall
was still open.

19:17.397 --> 19:18.743
I'd take Jenny
down there right now

19:18.881 --> 19:20.435
and just get
this whole wedding
over with.

19:20.573 --> 19:23.403
Then we could all
spend a nice, peaceful
Christmas together.

19:24.059 --> 19:25.923
You know,
I have an idea

19:26.061 --> 19:27.545
how to get some
Christmas spirit

19:27.683 --> 19:28.995
back into
this whole affair.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.962
Now, how are
you gonna do that?

19:31.100 --> 19:33.310
Lionel, would you
like to stop this fight

19:33.448 --> 19:34.725
between your
father and Tom?

19:34.863 --> 19:37.176
Sure. What have you
got in mind, ma?

19:40.765 --> 19:41.904
ALL: Oh!

19:44.838 --> 19:46.564
Okay, reverend,
are you all set?

19:46.702 --> 19:47.945
I don't know,
Mrs. Jefferson.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.636
I've never done
anything like
this before.

19:49.774 --> 19:52.121
Oh, Mrs. J,
I'm reporting
for duty.

19:52.260 --> 19:54.676
Oh, fine, Mr. Bentley,
come on in.

20:03.961 --> 20:04.996
GEORGE: You
come back, Willis.

20:05.134 --> 20:06.032
I'm not through
talking to you yet.

20:06.170 --> 20:08.241
TOM: But I'm
through listening!

20:08.379 --> 20:10.588
Oh, Santa!
Oh, shut up!

20:15.214 --> 20:16.318
What are you
doing here?

20:16.456 --> 20:18.044
Uh, your wife
asked us to
come up.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.322
I already gave you my money.
I'll see you next Christmas.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.186
Uh, your wife has
been telling me

20:22.324 --> 20:23.843
that the two of you
have been fighting.

20:23.981 --> 20:26.501
I believe she says
it had something
to do with a wedding.

20:26.639 --> 20:27.847
Yes, it has a lot
to do with a wedding!

20:27.985 --> 20:29.711
It's all his fault!
He's trying to run it!

20:29.849 --> 20:31.575
I'm the bride's father.
My son don't
mean nothing!

20:31.713 --> 20:33.680
Wait a minute.
Hold it, hold it!
Hold it.

20:33.818 --> 20:36.442
This is Christmas eve.
It's a time of love.

20:37.684 --> 20:40.031
How do I look,
Mr. Bentley?

20:40.169 --> 20:41.895
Absolutely beautiful.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.587
Yeah, I do, don't I?

20:46.141 --> 20:48.177
And arguing
about a wedding
of all things.

20:48.316 --> 20:50.697
I mean, a wedding
is supposed to
be a celebration

20:50.835 --> 20:52.354
where a group of
people gather together

20:52.492 --> 20:55.288
to join a man and woman
in holy matrimony.

20:55.426 --> 20:56.496
I knew that.

20:56.634 --> 20:58.671
Well, then, what's
the commotion?

20:58.809 --> 20:59.844
Do you have
any objections

20:59.982 --> 21:01.846
to your daughter
marrying Lionel?

21:01.984 --> 21:03.227
Of course not.

21:03.365 --> 21:06.955
Lionel's a fine
young man, in spite
of his father.

21:07.093 --> 21:09.647
Well, do you have
any objections to your
son marrying Jenny?

21:09.785 --> 21:11.097
It ain't that.

21:11.235 --> 21:13.341
It's just the kind
of wedding he's
throwing I object to.

21:13.479 --> 21:16.033
Well, that's such
a silly thing to
argue about.

21:17.241 --> 21:20.002
The basic wedding
ceremony is very simple,

21:20.140 --> 21:22.039
and it's quite beautiful.

21:22.177 --> 21:25.284
You see, all the minister
has to do is say,

21:25.422 --> 21:28.735
"Lionel, do you take
Jenny to be your
lawful wedded wife?"

21:28.873 --> 21:30.081
And then Lionel
would say...

21:30.979 --> 21:32.705
I do.

21:32.843 --> 21:34.293
And then he would say,

21:34.431 --> 21:37.537
"Jenny, do you take
Lionel to be your lawful
wedded husband?"

21:37.675 --> 21:39.194
And then
Jenny would say...

21:39.919 --> 21:41.817
I do.

21:41.955 --> 21:44.682
You see? It's all
very simple.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.753
And as long as it's
witnessed by two people,

21:47.651 --> 21:48.652
like those over there...

21:50.619 --> 21:52.483
Then all the minister
has to do is say,

21:52.621 --> 21:55.175
"by the power vested in me
by the state of New York,

21:56.487 --> 21:59.421
I now pronounce you
man and wife."

22:12.192 --> 22:14.263
Oh, my baby!

22:16.404 --> 22:18.854
Weezy, now, what's
wrong with you?

22:19.614 --> 22:21.961
I always cry
at weddings.

22:22.099 --> 22:24.135
If you're crying now,
what are you gonna do
at the real wedding?

22:24.273 --> 22:26.793
George, this is
the real wedding!

22:27.794 --> 22:28.899
What?

22:30.176 --> 22:32.592
She's right, George.
Our children are married.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.595
They're what?

22:37.425 --> 22:38.909
You mean, that was it?

22:39.944 --> 22:41.290
Lionel, how could you
do this to me?

22:41.981 --> 22:43.465
Because I love you, pop.

22:44.673 --> 22:47.020
And, you know,
I just didn't want
to get married

22:47.158 --> 22:48.643
without you being there.

22:48.781 --> 22:51.093
Married without a band.

22:53.095 --> 22:55.477
And I love my daddy.

22:56.582 --> 22:58.135
Did you really
marry them?

22:58.273 --> 23:00.655
Nope. They married
each other. I just
performed the ceremony.

23:00.793 --> 23:02.381
How could you do
a thing like that?

23:02.519 --> 23:03.761
Well, it's part
of my job.

23:03.899 --> 23:05.970
I happen to be an
ordained Baptist minister.

23:06.108 --> 23:08.594
You mean to tell me
you walked into my
house and tricked me...

23:08.732 --> 23:09.733
Did you say "Baptist"?

23:09.871 --> 23:11.148
That's right.

23:11.286 --> 23:14.807
Hey, willis,
you hear that?
He's Baptist.

23:17.948 --> 23:19.328
A Baptist!

23:22.608 --> 23:24.403
You wouldn't happen to be
part black too, would you?

23:26.128 --> 23:27.164
Nope.

23:27.302 --> 23:29.304
Well, nowadays
you never know.

23:30.581 --> 23:32.341
What are we gonna tell
Leonard about the wedding?

23:32.480 --> 23:35.483
Oh, tell him it was
very nice and to
send a present.

23:35.621 --> 23:37.243
Be serious!
What are we
going to do?

23:37.381 --> 23:38.900
How about
congratulating

23:39.038 --> 23:41.005
your daughter and
your new son-in-law?

23:41.143 --> 23:43.180
They're the ones
who count.

23:43.629 --> 23:44.699
You're right.

23:44.837 --> 23:47.598
CAROLERS:
Joy to the world

23:47.736 --> 23:49.255
The lord is come...

23:49.393 --> 23:51.153
I say, Mr. J,
congratulations.

23:51.291 --> 23:52.672
Don't congratulate
me, Bentley.

23:52.810 --> 23:53.984
Congratulate
the Willises

23:54.122 --> 23:55.779
for marrying into
such a fine family.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.022
Congratulations.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.301
Let every heart
prepare him room

24:01.440 --> 24:02.958
And heaven and nature sing

24:03.096 --> 24:06.755
And heaven and nature sing

24:06.893 --> 24:11.553
And heaven and heaven
and nature sing

24:11.691 --> 24:15.108
joy to the world...

24:39.443 --> 24:43.412
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
