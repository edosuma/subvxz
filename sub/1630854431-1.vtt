02:14.426 --> 02:16.928
[Joanna] I love her so much, Felix.

02:17.012 --> 02:20.557
- She is just so beautiful.
- Just like her mum.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.226
- [Chuckles]
- Oh...

02:23.310 --> 02:26.730
We are gonna have
the most peaceful Christmas this year.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.523
- Just the three of us.
- [Whispers] Yes.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.317
[Chuckles softly]

02:30.400 --> 02:32.670
You're sure your parents don't mind
that we're not going to them this year?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.154
They're fine, darling.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.757
I told them we'll see them
in the new year.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.367
Oh, good. I just
couldn't face the journey.

02:38.450 --> 02:42.412
I mean, this little munchkin is
enchanting, but she's exhausting.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.582
Plus, I hate the holidays.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.542
I just find everyone so annoying.

02:47.626 --> 02:52.422
Well, we are going to be alone.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.715
Hmm.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.093
My family were pretty appalling
last year, weren't they?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.053
- Your family are mad.
- [Chuckles softly]

02:58.136 --> 03:00.263
- I know.
- [Chuckles]

03:00.347 --> 03:02.015
But it all ended well, darling.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.811
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.400
[Phone ringing and vibrating]

03:12.734 --> 03:15.612
- [Baby crying]
- [Angry whisper] Hello. Who is this?!

03:15.696 --> 03:17.155
It's Caroline. Your sister?

03:18.407 --> 03:20.951
Caroline, are you insane
calling this late?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.704
Joanna, what are you talking about?
It's not late, it's 8 pm.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.932
I left you three messages,
and you never called me back.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.082
Is that Chloe crying?

03:27.165 --> 03:31.503
Who else would it be? She was sleeping
and you have woken her up.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.773
God knows how long it's gonna
take me to get her down again.

03:33.797 --> 03:37.217
Well, I am sorry, but why do you keep
a phone in her bedroom? It's absurd.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.471
She was in bed with me, Caroline.
Now, what do you want?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.931
Have you heard from Vicky?

03:43.014 --> 03:46.560
[Scoffs] No, of course I haven't spoken
to Vicky lately.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.104
- She's off in Tibet, finding herself.
- [Felix] Shh...

03:49.187 --> 03:51.106
Of course. I'm in London.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.983
We need to call an emergency
sisters meeting.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.945
Oh, god. What has
the Christmas family done now?

03:57.028 --> 04:00.323
It's dad! He's disappeared!

04:00.407 --> 04:02.826
What? Again?

04:20.135 --> 04:22.763
Sisters! Come in quick. I've got milk on.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.439
I haven't slept a wink since you called.
I am exhausted.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.902
All I do is pick up
all this stuff, bring it here,

04:36.985 --> 04:40.947
and the second I turn around again,
it's just come back. Oh, yeah.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.200
Okay, Caroline, my tree isn't decorated.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.118
Can you just stop staring at it?

04:45.202 --> 04:46.703
[Chuckles softly] I wasn't.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.872
- Yes, you were.
- I only bought it yesterday.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.916
It's lovely.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.959
She's adorable.

04:53.043 --> 04:57.714
Yeah. She's daddy's little girl.
[Chuckles]

04:57.798 --> 04:59.758
So, it's good to see you
in London, Caroline.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.593
How's everything at the manor?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.720
Oh, you know, wonderful.
[Chuckles softly]

05:04.721 --> 05:08.058
Okay, can we just start
this emergency sisters meeting?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.392
Okay, that's my cue to leave.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.938
- No, baby. Baby, stay.
- No, it's fine. It's perfectly fine.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.316
I'll be with little baby girl upstairs if
you need me. Come on, bubba.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.152
Let's leave mummy
to talk with her sisters.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.406
I had a call two days ago from Jackie.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.885
We've kind of developed a friendship.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.869
- Really?
- Really.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.706
And guess what? She and dad
broke up two months ago.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.084
Dad told her that he wasn't
in love with her anymore

05:34.167 --> 05:36.378
and he told her to pack
her things and leave.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.796
Just like that?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.799
You see? He finally saw through her.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.677
And I saw through her
the minute I met her, remember that.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.440
Well, actually,
I think she's rather sweet.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.407
I mean, when I spoke to her yesterday,
she seemed very sad about the whole thing.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.975
And she's terribly worried about dad.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.270
- You've spoken to her too?
- Yes, of course.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.039
Anyway, she's been trying
to call him for days

05:55.063 --> 05:56.690
and he's just completely disappeared.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.085
The neighbors went round to the house,
and it's all closed up.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.318
But Jackie went to the house,

06:00.402 --> 06:02.988
and she had a quick look
at dad's credit card statements.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.950
And dad has made several payments
from a hotel in Nevis, in the Caribbean.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.096
I've tried to call him there, he's not
taking any calls. Completely disappeared.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.623
I think dad is having
a massive emotional reaction.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.584
He must be totally depressed.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.879
What... what does mum say about all this?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.381
Well, mum's on a cruise
in the nile with uncle John.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.633
- Ugh.
- [Caroline] Yes, but it's fine.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.011
It's fine. Everything's fine.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.722
Why? Why is it fine?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.807
Well, because I booked tickets
for the three of us.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.611
We're going to the Caribbean
this afternoon.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.019
What?

06:34.102 --> 06:36.104
Yes. Boost dad's morale,
perk him up a bit,

06:36.187 --> 06:39.316
and we'll all be back here in england
by the 22nd, just in time for Christmas.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.069
- You two are insane. That is a...
- [Felix] It's a wonderful idea.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.449
I couldn't help but listen.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.328
Darling, you need to do this.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.873
You know, go find your dad, get some sun,
and come back for Christmas.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.543
There is no way I am leaving you two.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.253
That would make me a terrible mother.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.548
You're a wonderful mother.
But you need a break.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.551
It's only for a few days.
And you do look a little bit...

07:06.635 --> 07:07.552
What?

07:07.636 --> 07:09.763
- Exhausted.
- Mm-hmm.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.890
Really?

07:14.392 --> 07:15.644
Well, I mean...

07:15.727 --> 07:19.648
Okay, I... I could do
with a bit of sleepy time.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.941
Definitely, sweetheart.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.319
Jolly good. You might want to start
packing. The flight leaves at four.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.779
- Four?
- What?

07:27.238 --> 07:30.700
- Oh, baby.
- [Felix shushes]

07:30.784 --> 07:33.119
Mummy has to leave you, darling.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.207
And she's never left you before, but she
has to go with her annoying sisters.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.754
Okay, girls, let's do it.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.423
Great. Let's go save dad.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.637
[Caribbean version
of "achy breaky heart" playing]

08:08.405 --> 08:09.405
[Laughs]

08:55.535 --> 08:59.122
[Song continues]

10:20.245 --> 10:22.205
[All cheering]

10:23.206 --> 10:25.542
Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for my brother,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.628
Mr. James Christmas!

10:31.673 --> 10:33.007
Jimmy ray love!

10:33.091 --> 10:34.509
[Cheers and applause]

10:37.971 --> 10:39.556
- Thanks, man.
- Greatjob, man.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.682
[Chuckles]

10:40.765 --> 10:44.435
Mr. Christmas, great name
for the holidays, right?

10:44.519 --> 10:48.314
- Can I get a "ho ho ho"?!
- Ho ho ho!

10:48.398 --> 10:51.109
- Ho ho ho!
- Ho ho ho!

10:51.192 --> 10:53.153
One, two, three, four!

10:53.236 --> 10:55.238
[Caribbean music playing]

10:55.321 --> 10:56.573
Whoo! [Chuckles]

10:56.656 --> 10:59.993
Wow, Megan, you've got
some serious moves out there.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.412
Well, you can say the same
for yourself, James.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.832
[Chuckles softly] I love the Caribbean
twist on that song.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.333
[Chuckles softly]

11:07.417 --> 11:09.043
Excuse me, boss.

11:09.127 --> 11:13.590
Do you mind if! Interrupt this magical
moment to take your drink order?

11:13.673 --> 11:14.883
Frank, you killed it.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.844
Couple of your famous margaritas, please.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.512
I just made two. Coming right up.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.224
You staying for Christmas?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.268
- Oh, that's like a week away, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.479
I made a promise to myself I wouldn't plan
anything that far ahead anymore.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.733
Well, if you can plan
as far as this afternoon,

11:31.816 --> 11:33.818
maybe you could join us
at the beach yoga session.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.529
Our teacher, Vaughn, is very good.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.240
Okay, I'm in.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.327
Well, Mr. Rhythm, you got yourself a date.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.790
[Seagulls squawking]

11:49.125 --> 11:52.128
[Soft music playing]

12:37.715 --> 12:39.217
[Lighter clicks]

12:55.400 --> 12:57.026
[Wind blowing]

13:12.625 --> 13:13.626
Jimmy!

13:15.837 --> 13:18.840
Hey, James! What you doing out here?

13:20.383 --> 13:23.636
Come on up, man!
Let me buy you a drink!

13:33.479 --> 13:34.981
Sweet spot you got here.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.820
You're looking at the new owner
of this little piece of paradise.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.325
I haven't exactly moved in yet,

13:45.408 --> 13:48.619
but I'm spending more and more time here.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.372
Congratulations.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.044
Mind if I ask you a private question?

13:57.128 --> 13:58.629
Sure.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.174
You're a big star back in america.

14:02.592 --> 14:06.012
Why are you hiding out on a little
Caribbean island, singing in a beach bar?

14:10.475 --> 14:13.144
I reckon everybody on this island
is asking that same question.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.359
I wouldn't know.
I don't really take part in gossip.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.112
I'll be honest with you, my friend.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.283
Back in the day...

14:29.410 --> 14:32.121
I woke up every morning
just living to write another song.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.084
Music was everything.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.921
I wrote a bunch of songs.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.549
And got damn lucky a couple times.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.469
Real lucky.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.431
But my dad always said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good."

14:51.891 --> 14:53.601
- He was right about that.
- [Both chuckle]

14:55.311 --> 14:56.479
Anyhow...

14:58.731 --> 15:00.233
What goes up must come down.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.279
Yeah, I learned that the hard way.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.074
Music business...

15:09.075 --> 15:11.369
Became all about the business.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.706
Music just got lost.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.627
I dried up.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.880
Couldn't write a damn song if I had to.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.634
Just wasn't inspired.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.514
One day I got to thinking...

15:31.597 --> 15:33.933
Music is a common thread

15:34.016 --> 15:36.769
between the heart and soul
and the universe.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.357
Yeah. Anyway...

15:42.400 --> 15:46.154
I'm still searching.
I just don't know what I'm searching for.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.741
But I'll tell you one thing that changed.
When I came here?

15:53.744 --> 15:55.246
I was at peace.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.291
Just loved it here.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.169
And I never left.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.757
I'll drink to that.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.051
- [Glasses clink]
- Right on, my brother.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.642
[Upbeat music playing]

16:21.606 --> 16:23.608
[Joanna] I hope dad is on this island.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.278
[Meditative music playing]

16:28.946 --> 16:31.741
That's it. Breathe.

16:34.368 --> 16:38.539
Let the majesty of the island feel it.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.922
- Inhale...
- [Inhales deeply]

16:46.005 --> 16:50.218
Exhale out. That's good.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.016
Listen to the silence.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.854
I can't believe you didn't make us
a reservation at the hotel.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.333
It would have tipped him off
that we were coming, and knowing dad,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.710
he would have just disappeared
to another island or something.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.362
Well, okay, but we better
find him before Christmas

17:09.444 --> 17:11.489
because I need to get back to my baby.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.824
I know. But we had to come here
and find dad.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.867
I mean, we... we don't know where he is.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.788
It can't be that difficult.
It's a very small island.

[Meditative music playing]

17:21.457 --> 17:24.252
[Vaughn] Listen to the silence.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.295
Dad! Dad?!

17:26.378 --> 17:28.130
Look! Look at over there!

17:28.214 --> 17:31.342
[Shouting] Dad! Dad!

17:31.425 --> 17:33.636
[Sisters shouting in unison] Dad!

17:33.719 --> 17:36.430
- Dad!
- Daddy!

17:36.514 --> 17:38.057
Daddy, it's us! Dad!

17:38.140 --> 17:40.893
Ladies, we're having a yoga session here.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.853
- [James] Oh, dear lord.
- Please.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.481
- [Sisters] Dad! Dad!
- Do you know these people?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.317
- I'm afraid I do.
- [Joanna] Dad!

17:49.443 --> 17:51.153
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.822
It's not a problem.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.156
Sorry.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.038
- [Joanna] Dad! Come on!
- All right! You three!

17:58.119 --> 17:58.953
Dad!

17:59.036 --> 18:01.247
Dad, what are you doing here?

18:01.330 --> 18:03.916
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm doing yoga on the beach.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.461
- Well, yeah, we can see that.
- We have been worried sick about you.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.865
[Paulina] Dad, you're doing yoga?

18:09.797 --> 18:13.634
- What are you doing here, girls?
- Well, you totally disappeared.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.429
Jackie rang me. She was
in a complete panic.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.889
All right. I told Jackie
that she was too young for me.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.766
She had to move on with her life.

18:20.850 --> 18:24.270
Dad, we don't care about Jackie.
We care about you.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.732
Yes. We've called the hotel so many times.
I've left so many messages.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.027
Can't a man disappear without being
hunted down by his nosy daughters?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.612
- [Caroline] No.
- You see?

18:32.695 --> 18:35.281
This is what our father is like.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.326
Joanna, what are you even doing here?
What about Felix and Chloe?

18:38.409 --> 18:40.286
They're at home, in London.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.038
And I'm here because these two nutcases

18:42.121 --> 18:44.206
imagined you lying half dead
on a beach somewhere.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.501
I am here to rescue you, daddy.

18:47.585 --> 18:50.296
Aren't you just a little
bit happy to see us, dad?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.798
[Chuckles] Of course I am.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.467
Come here. Give me a hug.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.886
[Smooches]

19:00.431 --> 19:04.060
[James] All right.
Get you all checked in.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.395
Once you're settled in,
we have a lot to discuss.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.775
Now that's what I call a family.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.237
[Sentimental music playing]

19:39.804 --> 19:41.097
Hey, it's me.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.891
Hey. Hi, honey. You made it, then.

19:43.974 --> 19:48.437
- [Chloe crying]
- Oh, look at that beautiful little baby.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.399
[Chuckles] As you can see,
we've got a crying baby.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.359
[Felix shushing]

19:53.442 --> 19:56.821
- It's good. Have you found your dad yet?
- Hey.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.574
Hey. Yeah, dad is absolutely fine.

20:00.658 --> 20:04.203
Can you believe it? He was doing yoga
on the beach when we arrived.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.498
Yoga? [Chuckles] Good for him.

20:07.581 --> 20:11.460
Look, darling, I've got a crying baby
here. I think she's hungry.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.964
Oh, well, kiss her for me.
Does she miss me?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.757
Of course she does.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.427
It's all right.
Say bye-bye to mummy.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.720
- Love you.
- Bye-bye.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.973
Look, get some sleep.
I've gotta go. All right.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.307
- [Phone beeps]
- Miss you.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.393
- [Birds chirping]
- [Door opens]

20:31.021 --> 20:33.232
- So?
- Hey, daddy.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.817
How is my little granddaughter doing?

20:34.900 --> 20:38.487
Oh, daddy, she is just gorgeous.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.865
- Do you have a picture?
- I do.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.908
There. Look at that, that was yesterday.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.662
I mean, don't get me wrong.
She's a handful.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.957
[Scoffs] No surprise there.
Look who her mother is.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.459
[Chuckles sarcastically]

20:51.542 --> 20:52.626
Well, she's adorable.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.086
- How's Felix doing?
- He's fine.

20:54.170 --> 20:58.674
Oh. And you?
How are you, my daughter?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.760
I'm fine.

21:00.843 --> 21:04.555
Though, I am pretty stressed
most of the time.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.640
I mean, having a baby is wonderful.

21:06.724 --> 21:10.186
But it's a bit like being
in the eye of a storm.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.897
It's magnificent, fabulous...

21:14.190 --> 21:16.192
But scary.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.987
I don't know if I'm doing
everything right, dad.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.448
I mean, there's just so much
for me to remember.

21:24.283 --> 21:29.163
Some of the time, I just self-indulgently
throw myself on the sofa and cry.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.334
- Does that make me a bad mum?
- Not at all.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.378
Your mother and I were lost
when you came along.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.632
We were just 17 years old.
Your mother was scared senseless.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.177
But you'll see, it gets easier day to day.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.138
- Sure?
- Absolutely.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.890
It's the circle of life.

21:56.899 --> 22:00.611
Now get up, I told your sisters to meet us
at my favorite place in Nevis for a drink.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.988
Are you okay, dad?

22:03.072 --> 22:06.450
Of course. Come on, let's go.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.828
[Chuckles]

22:13.249 --> 22:15.251
[Lively music playing]

22:19.880 --> 22:23.551
I swear, the first diaper
I changed nearly made me pass out.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.803
I mean, she seemed
such a tiny little thing.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.471
Where did it all come from?

22:27.555 --> 22:29.431
- [Chuckling]
- Whereas Felix,

22:29.515 --> 22:32.351
he took to it like a duck to water.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.745
Honestly, I really think they have

22:33.769 --> 22:37.690
some little secret sign language
going on behind my back.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.650
Having a child changes a woman.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.235
It brings out the best in her.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.879
Are you saying,
I was any different before?

22:42.903 --> 22:46.448
What? No. Not at all.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.741
- Caroline?
- Hmm?

22:47.825 --> 22:49.886
How about you and Peter?
How are things with you two?

22:49.910 --> 22:52.788
Oh, well... after last year's crisis,

22:52.872 --> 22:55.624
things are just perfect.

We now have sex twice a week,
Saturdays and wednesdays.

Mark it down in your awful little planner.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.800
Oh, I don't need to.
I have an alert on my phone.

23:04.884 --> 23:09.096
I never knew that shopping for sexy
lingerie could be quite so exciting.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.116
You have no idea how many
shades of red there are.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.558
Unbelievable!

23:12.641 --> 23:14.894
She'll be telling us
what he says in bed next.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.812
"Yes." that's what he says in bed.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.982
- Yes. [Giggles]
- [Joanna] God.

23:20.065 --> 23:24.695
What has become of my... my nomad,
runaway, insane daughter Vicky?

23:24.778 --> 23:26.363
Where is she? What's up?

23:26.447 --> 23:28.866
Well, she's in Tibet... or India.
One of them.

23:28.949 --> 23:32.161
Anyway, she's on an ashram
studying meditation

23:32.244 --> 23:34.288
and getting in touch with her inner self.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.957
Or with her guru's outer self. [Chuckles]

23:37.041 --> 23:40.461

a free spirit, Joanna.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.338

23:43.714 --> 23:48.260
And you, you ditched
this whole beatle thing?

23:48.344 --> 23:51.722
Yeah. I finished my thesis,
and I shed my fab four persona.

23:52.723 --> 23:56.769
Yes. And this... this new skin
you're sporting is...?

Can't you tell?

24:00.648 --> 24:04.902
Only the greatest female
blues singer of the '603.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.531
- Janis joplin!
- Ah.

24:09.615 --> 24:13.118
I am writing a book about her days
in haight-ashbury.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.537

24:15.621 --> 24:17.498

- Promise me...

24:19.833 --> 24:21.293
At some point,

24:21.377 --> 24:26.590
you'll take the time
to think about you, Paulina.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.636
That beautiful girl inside.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.764
She deserves to see
the world too, you know.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.601
What about that girl that, you know,

24:37.685 --> 24:39.687
the pretty girl that you met
at... at the bar?

24:39.770 --> 24:42.666
The... the really cute one when we all went
out and got drunk at the local pub.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.024
Oh, gosh, what a night that was.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.443
Yeah, when Jackie
nearly blew your house up.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.529
We broke up.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.698
I believe I've evolved.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.034
Okay, so speaking of breaking up, dad,

24:54.118 --> 24:56.036
why don't you tell us all about Jackie?

24:56.120 --> 24:58.580
Yes. She seemed so good for you.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.457
Was she?

25:00.541 --> 25:03.752
Well... yes. Yes, she was.

25:05.087 --> 25:08.507
But we... evolved too.
I had to let her go...

25:11.010 --> 25:13.178
In favor of some... new beginnings.

25:13.262 --> 25:17.391
But what's important is now.

25:17.474 --> 25:21.228
This very moment, I am
on a Caribbean island...

25:21.311 --> 25:24.565

four daughters,

25:24.648 --> 25:26.316
and I couldn't be happier.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.652

more wonderful.

aren't you full of surprises?

26:18.118 --> 26:19.745
Actually, not.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.372
I knew the second I saw 'em
get off that boat down there.

- They also said dad.

[Tearfully] How long have you known?

32:22.858 --> 32:26.236
A few months ago,
I was feeling very tired.

32:27.654 --> 32:31.783
I had them run some tests,
and it turned out I had cancer.

32:33.410 --> 32:37.622
- Does Jackie know?
- No. I never told her. I...

32:38.707 --> 32:41.668
I didn't want her to be around,
not to see any of this.

32:44.671 --> 32:48.216
Dad, you need to get treatment.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.178
You can't stay here. You... you have
to come home with us.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.890
I'm not doing chemo.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.809
I'm not gonna waste away
on some hospital bed in London.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.604
I'm gonna deal with this
on my own terms...

33:02.898 --> 33:05.734
Watching the sun rise and set, right here.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.198
Listen to me.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.452
I need you to promise me something.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.083
I need you to swear
that you will not tell your sisters.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.630
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

33:28.298 --> 33:32.552
Let me enjoy these couple
of days with my beautiful daughters.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.221
Do this for me.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.806
Let this be my Christmas present.

33:38.391 --> 33:41.561
- Please.
- It's a lot to ask.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.065
I know.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.442
But I believe I can trust you
to make that promise.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.694
Yes?

33:53.323 --> 33:54.491
Okay.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.246
- [Sniffles]
- Now, don't we have a...

33:59.329 --> 34:00.747
Boat ride in a couple of minutes?

34:09.255 --> 34:10.255
[Sniffles]

34:13.260 --> 34:14.844
I love you.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.763
I love you more.

34:19.349 --> 34:20.516
[Sniffles]

34:22.060 --> 34:24.020
[James sighs]

34:27.440 --> 34:28.858
[Seagulls squawking]

34:38.534 --> 34:41.246
[Megan] So... four daughters?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.206
[Both chuckle]

34:44.623 --> 34:46.626
You certainly kept that one quiet.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.380
You really are a man of mystery,
Mr. Christmas.

34:50.463 --> 34:53.550
Well, not really, Megan.

34:53.632 --> 34:54.842
[Megan chuckles]

34:55.927 --> 34:59.431
You see, honestly, I carry a bit of shame
about my daughters

35:00.932 --> 35:03.518
which lasted until they forgave me
just last Christmas.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.857
Several years ago, my wife fell in love
with my older brother.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.109
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.739
And rather than having them
watch me self-destruct, I...

35:18.033 --> 35:19.159
I left them.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.206
Well, they are here now.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.917
And they must love you very much.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.419
[Scoffs, chuckles]

35:33.882 --> 35:36.134
Megan seems like a nice person.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.386
Mm-hmm.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.889
- But?
- But what?

35:40.972 --> 35:43.172
Well, usually when you make
that noise, there's a "but."

35:43.224 --> 35:48.063
- No, not at all. But...
- There you are.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.690
Don't you think it's just
a little too soon after Jackie?

35:50.774 --> 35:54.152
If dad wants to have fun,
he should have fun.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.820
It's none of our business.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.158
Who are you,
and what have you done with Joanna?

36:01.993 --> 36:03.286
[Chuckles softly]

36:03.370 --> 36:05.580
I still think we should find out
more about her, though.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.667
- Start digging.
- Why is it always me?

36:08.750 --> 36:11.503
Because you look so sweet and innocent,
and nobody suspects you.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.296
Wow.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.925
Some light, huh? [Chuckles]
Another wonderful day.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.514
So, Megan, are you and my dad together?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.367
Oh, my god! I can't
believe she just asked that.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.310
- [Fake laughs]
- No, we're not.

36:27.394 --> 36:28.895
Megan and I are
just friends, Paulina.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.648
Friends are good.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.943
- Happy now?
- [Light chuckle]

36:35.026 --> 36:36.861
And what about you, Paulina?

36:36.945 --> 36:39.531
Joanna and Caroline seem happily married.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.325
Oh, I'm... I'm single. And I'm a lesbian.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.872
How about you, Megan?

36:47.956 --> 36:51.000
Well, my parents aren't around anymore.

36:51.084 --> 36:54.713
But even though I'm alone,
I could never leave the island.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.589
Nevis is my home.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.299
So, no husband then?

36:58.383 --> 37:01.636
No. But I have been in love.

37:01.720 --> 37:05.390
You know, before this interrogation
gets any sillier, I'm going swimming.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.975
Hang on to that for me, will you?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.340
- [Laughs loudly]
- Yes, he is...

37:10.395 --> 37:11.980
- Oh, he really is.
- Oh! [Laughs]

37:13.857 --> 37:16.735
- [Laughing]
- Aw...

37:16.818 --> 37:19.362
Come on in, girls! This is amazing.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.781
[Contented sigh]

37:23.324 --> 37:25.326
[Seagulls squawking]

38:07.368 --> 38:09.370
[Cheering and applause]

38:10.497 --> 38:13.500
["Where'm I gonna live" begins]

39:16.187 --> 39:17.397
Y'all sing it now!

39:18.857 --> 39:21.860
[Song continues]

40:09.908 --> 40:12.493
Whoo!

40:12.577 --> 40:13.870
[Cheenng]

40:15.622 --> 40:17.457
[Jimmy] The Christmas family!

40:17.540 --> 40:18.917
[Cheering continues]

40:25.924 --> 40:28.927
[Sentimental music playing]

40:37.936 --> 40:39.354
[Crickets chirping]

40:46.736 --> 40:48.071
[Waves rolling in]

40:50.865 --> 40:52.784
It was quite an eventful day.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.453
Yes. Dad, thank you so much.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.956
Well, thank Megan.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.708
She put together the best parts.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.085
I have an idea.

41:02.168 --> 41:07.382
Why don't y'all share one of your favorite
Christmas memories with us?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.264
Yeah, I have one.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.517
I'd love to hear it.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.729
I was five, I think.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.149
I was rooting around
dad's record collection.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.443
All these wonderful old vinyls.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.362
And I closed my eyes,

41:29.445 --> 41:31.406
and I pulled out a random album.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.699
When I opened them,

41:32.782 --> 41:36.035
it was tamla motown's
Christmas greats.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.663
And I put the record on,
and dad came in

41:38.746 --> 41:41.332
and he caught me dancing
to the Jackson five,

41:41.416 --> 41:45.211
singing "Santa claus is coming to town."
[Chuckles]

41:45.294 --> 41:47.922
He was laughing his head off.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.507
And when I was done...

41:50.508 --> 41:53.511
He gave me the album to keep.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.430
My first ever record.

41:56.431 --> 41:57.682
I still have it.

42:02.103 --> 42:03.271
What about you, Megan?

42:04.522 --> 42:08.109
Ah, I'm not really one for reminiscing.

42:08.192 --> 42:11.612
Oh, come on. You must have
one memory to share.

42:13.281 --> 42:14.282
Well...

42:15.950 --> 42:18.703
I do remember one Christmas Eve

42:18.786 --> 42:22.290
when my father was helping my mother
put up the Christmas tree,

42:22.373 --> 42:25.793
and he suddenlyjust stopped
and kissed her.

42:27.128 --> 42:31.174
I never knew anyone
to kiss with so much love as they did.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.806
- [Sighs] Your turn, Caroline.
- [Joanna] Oh, no.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.141
Don't open pandora's box.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.770
Oh, stop it. It's easy.

42:43.853 --> 42:44.979
Last Christmas.

42:46.022 --> 42:49.776
After being away for 15 years,

42:49.859 --> 42:53.362
dad came back,
and we were a family again.

42:54.947 --> 42:57.575
And it was crazy and chaotic...

43:00.119 --> 43:01.579
But it was perfect.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.002
Joanna.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.296
My favorite Christmas memory...

43:10.379 --> 43:12.048
You don't have to say it, Joanna.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.008
Oh, but I do.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.636
It was snowing.

43:16.719 --> 43:19.263
Mum had taken the other girls
to the Christmas fair,

43:19.347 --> 43:23.017
leaving just me and dad home together.

43:24.018 --> 43:27.814
So, we snuggled up and we watched
a Christmas movie on TV.

43:29.357 --> 43:31.442
Then dad said,

43:32.443 --> 43:34.529
"get your coat and gloves.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.532
We're gonna go out and build
a snowman for your sisters."

43:39.283 --> 43:42.870
I was so excited, and we built
the biggest snowman ever.

43:44.455 --> 43:48.084
Then dad picked me up and he said...

43:50.503 --> 43:52.338
Do you remember what you said?

43:55.758 --> 43:58.761
I said I would always
love you and protect you...

44:00.763 --> 44:02.682
And I would never, ever leave you.

44:05.935 --> 44:08.938
That's right. You know what, dad?

44:10.356 --> 44:11.983
You never did leave me.

44:13.985 --> 44:18.322
You were with me every minute...

44:18.406 --> 44:21.742
Of every day of my life.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.878
What about you, Jimmy love?

44:31.961 --> 44:33.671
- For real?
- [Paulina] Yeah.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.553
My favorite Christmas memory...

44:42.263 --> 44:43.264
This one.

44:44.265 --> 44:48.269
Watching y'all be the family I never had.

44:53.232 --> 44:56.235
[Soft melodious music playing]

[Sentimental music playing]

46:03.469 --> 46:05.471
[Birds chirping]

46:11.018 --> 46:12.436
Morning, daddy.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.525
[James] You're up early.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.777
Oh, I want to make the most of this trip.

46:21.904 --> 46:23.447
What's the plan for today?

46:25.241 --> 46:27.410
Let's start with some breakfast.

46:29.412 --> 46:31.163
[Cozy festive music playing]

46:31.247 --> 46:32.915
I'm stuffed.

46:34.125 --> 46:36.002
- Is this you or me?
- You.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.633
- Good morning, Mr. Christmas.
- Good morning, Vanessa.

46:42.717 --> 46:46.387
- You didn't forget me, right?
- How could I forget you?

46:46.470 --> 46:47.948
If you've finished breakfast, shall we?

46:47.972 --> 46:49.572
- We shall, indeed.
- Where are we going?

46:49.640 --> 46:52.935
Come along, girls. Vanessa
runs a program for kids.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.854
[Caroline] Oh, program for kids.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.398
How old is she?

46:58.566 --> 47:01.569
["O Christmas tree" big band version
playing throughout]

48:29.115 --> 48:30.199
So, we bake the cookies.

48:30.282 --> 48:33.536
And then we deliver them to the older
people in our community

48:33.619 --> 48:35.830
who can't go out and shop
for themselves anymore.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.915
We do this because...

48:37.998 --> 48:40.626
[All] Sharing is caring!

48:40.709 --> 48:46.257
I'm sorry, children...
I... I've gotten so old I...

48:46.340 --> 48:49.760
I can barely hear what you're saying.
Would you mind repeating that, please?

48:49.844 --> 48:52.346
Sharing is caring!

48:52.430 --> 48:53.597
Eh?

[All laughing]

48:57.768 --> 48:59.854
[Laughs] Oh, that's better.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.523
Go ahead, Leo.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.650
Is your last name really Christmas?

49:04.733 --> 49:07.862
Yes. My name is James Christmas.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.905
Do you know Santa personally?

49:09.989 --> 49:13.200
I'd have to say that Santa and I

49:13.284 --> 49:15.536
have a very special bond.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.913
I hope he likes our Christmas cookies.

49:17.997 --> 49:20.249
Oh, I'm sure he will, Jackson.

49:20.332 --> 49:22.960
Well, kids, I think
we should say a huge thanks

49:23.043 --> 49:25.546
and a big applause to Mr. Christmas!

49:25.629 --> 49:27.232
- [Kids] Yeah!
- Thank you, Mr. Christmas!

49:30.217 --> 49:33.971
and I tell you what. Cenita, Jackson,
Christian, Leo, you come with me.

to deliver these cookies.

- Yes. Yes, they are.

meant to hurt you, Caroline.

I love you and your sisters, don't you?

51:12.611 --> 51:14.071
Of course.

I, uh, need to lie down.
I'm gonna take a nap. [Sniffles]

have some dinner tonight.

52:01.702 --> 52:03.704
I don't know. Something's up.

52:05.164 --> 52:07.204
We were delivering cookies,
and everything was fine,

52:07.249 --> 52:10.836
and then he started coughing,
and he has a fever.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.172
He's resting.

52:15.883 --> 52:17.718
What is it, Joanna?

52:17.801 --> 52:20.346
- Nothing.
- You're lying.

52:20.429 --> 52:22.681
What? Why is she lying?

52:22.765 --> 52:24.975
She knows something. Spit it out.

52:26.894 --> 52:29.605
I can't. I made a promise.

52:29.688 --> 52:31.106
What promise?

52:33.525 --> 52:36.654
Joanna. Tell us.

52:38.072 --> 52:39.323
[Paulina] Please.

52:43.869 --> 52:45.871
Okay. Yeah.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.207
Let's... let's go sit down.

52:58.592 --> 52:59.843
Well?

53:01.720 --> 53:03.263
Dad has cancer.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.182
You're not serious?

53:05.265 --> 53:07.601
I'm not gonna joke
about something like this, am I?

53:09.812 --> 53:11.021
No, no, of course not, but...

53:12.106 --> 53:14.191
When? How?

53:16.735 --> 53:18.775
- Caroline, what are you doing?
- I'm calling Vicky.

53:18.821 --> 53:20.674
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I mean, she has to know.

53:20.698 --> 53:22.324
I have to call her.
No, she has to know!

53:22.408 --> 53:26.245
Please stop! Our daddy is sick.

53:28.330 --> 53:29.665
Mwmm

53:32.835 --> 53:35.963
I can't believe this.
When did you find out?

53:36.964 --> 53:40.426
Yesterday. But he made me promise
not to tell you both.

53:40.509 --> 53:46.098
He just wants to enjoy
this time with his daughters.

53:48.434 --> 53:51.228
Well, obviously Jackie doesn't know,
othennise she'd be here.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.650
What are we gonna do?

53:56.734 --> 54:00.404
Look, you two have to behave
as if you don't know.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.156
- What?
- [Joanna] Please.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.657
I promised.

54:03.741 --> 54:08.245
We can't just ignore the fact
that he's sick, finish our little vacation

54:08.328 --> 54:12.374
and wave goodbye
for the last time. Can we?

54:15.669 --> 54:16.754
Absolutely not.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.925
Here's what we're going to do.
We're gonna keep his secret.

54:22.009 --> 54:24.928
But the three of us have to do
everything we possibly can

54:25.012 --> 54:26.930
to show him how precious he is to us.

54:27.014 --> 54:29.600
And we have to convince him
to come back to england with us

54:29.683 --> 54:31.852
so he can get treatment
and we can take care of him.

54:31.935 --> 54:32.978
Agreed?

54:33.061 --> 54:35.230
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.443
Okay, we have a mission to accomplish.

54:39.526 --> 54:41.028
Absolutely. Of course we do.

54:41.111 --> 54:43.113
Father Christmas
is not dying on our watch.

54:45.574 --> 54:46.742
[Phone ringing]

54:49.787 --> 54:52.623
- Hi, darling.
- Hey. Hi, sweetheart.

54:52.706 --> 54:53.999
How's my little girl?

54:54.082 --> 54:55.584
Oh, she's fast asleep.

54:56.585 --> 54:57.920
You okay?

54:59.838 --> 55:02.299
- Not really.
- What's wrong?

55:02.382 --> 55:03.801
It's dad.

55:04.885 --> 55:06.303
He's got cancer.

55:06.386 --> 55:08.055
Oh, no.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.724
Oh, honey.

55:11.975 --> 55:13.519
Babe, I'm so sorry.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.146
You are gonna bring him home, right?

55:18.106 --> 55:19.399
I'm not sure.

55:22.945 --> 55:24.154
Honey, um...

55:24.238 --> 55:25.280
Anything you need,

55:25.364 --> 55:28.116
I'm here for you, okay? I love you.

55:28.200 --> 55:31.328
I love you too.
Kiss that little baby for me.

55:31.411 --> 55:32.830
Of course.

55:32.913 --> 55:35.249
I'm gonna go. I don't really feel like
talking now, but...

55:35.332 --> 55:37.084
I'll call you later, okay?

55:37.167 --> 55:39.294
Okay. Love you.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.714
- Lots of love. Bye.
- [Phone beeps oft]

55:44.424 --> 55:47.427
- [Sighs]
- [Sentimental music playing]

56:11.535 --> 56:12.786
[Phone ringing and vibrating]

56:15.914 --> 56:16.914
[Phone beeps]

56:18.292 --> 56:20.210
- Yeah?
- Hey, my brother.

56:20.294 --> 56:22.045
Hey, Jimmy. How are you, man?

56:22.129 --> 56:23.881
What are you and your girls doing tonight?

56:23.964 --> 56:26.758
- I don't think we have anything planned.
- Oh, really?

56:26.842 --> 56:31.013
Why don't you let me treat
y'all to a big dinner down at sunshine's?

56:31.096 --> 56:34.099
Maybe some of that house rum
of his, if you know what I'm saying?

56:34.182 --> 56:35.726
Well, that's awfully nice of you.

56:35.809 --> 56:38.770
It might be a nice way
to send the girls off.

56:38.854 --> 56:40.774
Okay, then. Well, I'll see you
when you get here.

56:42.524 --> 56:43.817
We'll see you later. Thanks.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.412
Do you ever run out
of amazing places here?

56:55.495 --> 56:58.332
- It's incredible.
- What are these?

56:58.415 --> 57:02.336
It's a homemade rum,
made with a secret ingredient.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.713
- What secret ingredient?
- Sunshine.

57:04.796 --> 57:06.089
- Oh.
- [Laughs]

57:06.173 --> 57:08.050
It's called a killer bee.

57:08.133 --> 57:10.469
You gotta be careful,
they're dangerous and addictive.

57:10.552 --> 57:13.055
Here's to killer bees
and the island of Nevis.

57:13.138 --> 57:14.222
Killer bees!

57:14.306 --> 57:16.934
- Nevis.
- [All] Nevis.

57:17.017 --> 57:18.936
- There's sunshine now.
- [Joanna] Hey, there.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.539
We're gonna need
some more killer bees.

57:20.604 --> 57:21.772
More killer bees be right up.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.207
- Thank you.
- [Jimmy] Thank you, sir.

57:23.231 --> 57:25.651
- Be right back with your food.
- [All] Thank you.

57:25.734 --> 57:27.653
Thank you, sir. Well done.

57:29.321 --> 57:31.114
Well, seems like
y'all know a lot about me,

57:31.198 --> 57:35.243
so how about I learn
a little bit about you all?

57:35.327 --> 57:37.663
Carolina, is it true you live
in a castle?

57:37.746 --> 57:41.416
Oh, that old thing.
[Chuckles] Yes.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.586
But really, it just was passed down
through my husband's family.

57:44.670 --> 57:47.130
You know, 16th century,
go off, fight a war,

57:47.214 --> 57:49.591
come back, get a castle
for your troubles.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.720
Joanna, what about you?

57:53.804 --> 57:56.431
Oh, well, I am a fashion editor.

57:56.515 --> 57:59.643
And I'm also mummy
to a beautiful little girl.

58:01.436 --> 58:03.021
Now, you and this Janis thing.

58:03.105 --> 58:05.691
If it's just a phase,
it's working for you.

58:05.774 --> 58:08.318
And if you gonna be somebody,
be Janis, I always say.

58:08.402 --> 58:09.903
[Chuckles]

58:09.987 --> 58:11.798
Oh, you didn't see her
during her Beatles phase.

58:11.822 --> 58:13.949
She had a mop top for a long time.

58:14.032 --> 58:15.826
It was only for 10 years, Caroline.

58:17.119 --> 58:19.287
When I was a little girl,

58:19.371 --> 58:21.665
I fell in love with the Beatles,
especially Paul.

58:21.748 --> 58:25.544
And when I grew up, I chose to do
my thesis on them.

58:25.627 --> 58:27.838
I consider myself
a bit of a method writer.

58:27.921 --> 58:29.756
I like to live in their style, you know?

58:29.840 --> 58:31.967
I think it helps the process.

58:32.050 --> 58:35.053
[Sentimental music playing]

58:37.097 --> 58:38.533
- Cheers. To the process.
- Very proud of you.

58:38.557 --> 58:40.100
- [Joanna] Cheers.
- [Caroline] Whoo.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.436
- [Jimmy] Whoa.
- [Joanna] Oh, wow.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.354
- [Jimmy] Sunshine.
- [Joanna] Look at that.

58:44.438 --> 58:46.648
- Yes, I am.
- Yum.

58:46.732 --> 58:48.483
Oh, dad.

58:55.907 --> 58:57.677
- [Caroline] Good night.
- [James] Night, Jimmy ray.

58:57.701 --> 59:00.454
Good night, girls, James!

59:05.876 --> 59:08.545
- How you feeling, dad?
- Great. I'm content.

59:08.628 --> 59:11.590
I have my three girls
with me. [Chuckles softly]

59:12.591 --> 59:14.885
- I do get it, you know.
- What's that?

59:14.968 --> 59:19.014
The pull of this place.
It's like paradise.

59:19.097 --> 59:21.683
I think I had too many killer bees.

59:21.767 --> 59:22.893
[Joanna chuckles]

59:22.976 --> 59:25.645
You know what? I miss Vicky.

59:25.729 --> 59:30.150
Oh, I know. I tried calling her, but she
answers her phone like once a month.

59:30.233 --> 59:34.696
Well, let's send her a video message,
the four of us.

59:34.780 --> 59:36.073
- Oh.
- That's a good idea.

59:36.156 --> 59:39.034
- Paulina, you will be the cameraman.
- Yeah. I have my phone.

59:40.952 --> 59:42.662
- [Caroline] Okay.
- Okay.

59:42.746 --> 59:43.955
- [Phone beeps]
- Go.

59:44.039 --> 59:45.373
[All] Hi, Vicky!

59:45.457 --> 59:46.958
- Hi, hun.
- We miss you.

59:47.042 --> 59:49.503
Listen. I... I miss you,
sweetheart, every day.

59:49.586 --> 59:52.714
And I... I just want to say,
you know, be safe, and I...

59:54.549 --> 59:56.843
I want you to have a wonderful life.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.178
I love you.

59:58.261 --> 59:59.429
- We love you.
- We love you.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:02.390
- Stay safe.
- [All] Bye. Bye.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:03.600
- [Phone beeps]
- Sent.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.229
Oh, yes. You know
what you should do, dad?

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:09.356
You should come back
to england with us

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.441
- and have Christmas there.
- [In unison] Yes.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:15.445
[Chuckles] No, no. I don't think so.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.614
I... the weather
does not agree with me.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.908
It's not that bad.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:21.993
Don't you want to have
Christmas with us, daddy?

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.745
Well, then, I'll do one better.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.664
Why don't we all stay
and have Christmas here?

01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:26.998
- [Gasps] Yes!
- Yes?

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.018
Oh, we could bring everyone out.
Peter and the kids.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.168
Uh, Felix and Chloe.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.188
- Yes. And Vicky and mum and uncle John.
- [Caroline] Yes.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:34.798
All right, all right.
Let's not get carried away.

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.342
Caroline, don't go changing
your Christmas traditions.

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.778
I know how important they are to you.

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:41.638
No. Come on, Caroline can
live dangerously for one year,

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:45.308
- can't you, Caroline?
- Yes. Yes, yes, I can.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.769
Come on, dad. Say yes.

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:52.065
- May I sleep on it?
- Okay.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.526
- I'm going to bed. Good night, ladies.
- Yeah, all right.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:57.129
- [Caroline and Joanna] Good night.
- [Paulina] Good night, dad.

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.702
What do we think?

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:05.287
I don't know.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.292
I don't want to lose my daddy.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.253
[Crickets chirping]

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:36.985
You told them.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.824
They're your daughters, dad.
They needed to know.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:48.455
Why don't you go sleep on that?

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.711
Good night.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.648
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:15.982
Where's my dad?

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.318
Your father left you this note.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:19.653
Thank you.

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:24.449
"Meet me here." And an address.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.996
Oh, gosh.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.331
[Vehicle approaching]

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:55.480
[Door closes]

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:09.077
- What is this place?
- I bought it.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.871
I'm thinking about slapping
a fresh coat of paint on it.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.792
Best view on the island,

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:18.461
and that rhythm is just perfect.

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:22.757
Now, if you three would kindly be seated,

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.885
I have something to explain to you.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:28.972
[Sentimental music playing]

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.356
This thing I have, this cancer.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:42.986
It's in my head.
It's called a meningioma.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:46.865
It started with headaches and dizziness,
a couple of blackouts.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:49.784
They have to monitor its growth.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.454
When it reaches a certain size,
the only option is to operate.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:56.249
If and when that happens,
I will have to decide what to do.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.293
If I choose to do that,

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.880
then I will decide
where to have the operation.

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:05.133
Until then, I am staying here.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:10.013
So you slept on our suggestions
and ignored them.

01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:13.029
I want you to go back to your families...

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:16.436
And to your dreams.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.814
And it is not because I don't love you,

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:23.193
it's because I want you
to remember me like this.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.153
It's not fair.

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:28.823
You know perfectly well you would get
much better treatment at home,

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:30.784
with all of us around you.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.328
How could you do this to us?

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:37.123
I do not want you
to change your life for me.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.585
And more importantly,

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:44.714
I do not want you to watch me fade away.

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:48.843
I will not allow it.

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:51.304
That's why you will be getting
on that plane in the morning.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.556
That's why you left Jackie, isn't it?

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:59.020
Jackie is a vibrant,
beautiful young woman.

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:01.856
Her time is better spent elsewhere.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:08.029
So, you're basicallyjust pushing away
everybody who's ever loved you.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:09.823
It's so selfish!

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.324
Mwmm

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.645
It's not fair.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:47.277
You can't just ask us
to leave, just like that.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.321
"Bye, dad. See you at your funeral."

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.158

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:55.243
Cancer is treatable.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.123
And I waited so long
to have you back in my life,

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:03.168
and now I'm going to lose you again,
but this time forever.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:06.378
[Sobbing]

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:10.508
You're not gonna lose me. I promise.

Oh. Hello, Leo.

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:28.193
Hi, Mr. Christmas.
I have a question for you.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.903
Go ahead.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:33.156
Would you please be my instructor
for my sailing class today?

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:35.200
Of course.

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:37.118
Is it okay if! Bring
my daughters along too?

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:39.579
- Okay.
- Very well then.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.955
See you soon.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.208
Mm-hmm. Bye.

[Upbeat music playing]

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.610
I heard you are leaving the island soon.

[Sighs]

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:18.618
You know...

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.038
They want the children on the island

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:25.208
to love and respect the water

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:28.086
as much as they love
and respect each other.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:33.967
Yeah, I can see that.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:38.388
[Upbeat music continues]

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:41.891
You have to keep the boat straight.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:44.936
I know. I'm trying.
Just has a mind of its own.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.356
Ooh. Oh! We're getting it,

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:49.983
we're getting it! [Chuckles]

01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:58.992
- Am I doing okay?
- Yes, you're doing great.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:02.745
- Then why are you staring at me?
- Your eyes are beautiful.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:06.082
You look like a Princess to me.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.210
Oh, sweetheart. You're the Princess.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.129
- {giggles} - Come on.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.935
Mr. Christmas, can I ask you something?

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:29.731
Do you have a girlfriend?

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:34.861
Tough question, Leo.
What makes you ask such a thing?

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.654
My mom was wondering.
I heard her asking her friend.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.365
I see.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.700
So, do you have one?

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:46.122
Uh... I, uh... well...

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:50.542
Mom! Mr. Christmas
doesn't have a girlfriend!

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.051
Where's your dad, Leo?

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.595
Gone. My parents are divorced.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.599
I think you'd make a great dad.

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:07.268
Well, that's...
That's very kind of you, Leo.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:09.496
Uh, why don't we just
focus on the sailing for now, huh?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.481
- Okay.
- You ready to come about?

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:12.814
- Yep!
- [Groaning]

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.322
It's obvious, right?

[Sentimental music playing]

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:56.025
Well done. Give yourselves a hand.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.777
Now, listen up, you squabs,

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.446
I'm buying each and every
one of you some ice cream.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.989
- On me, let's go!
- [Kids] Yay!

How is it possible to feel so sad
and so happy at the same time?

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:30.518
I've never felt like this before.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.146
None of us have.

[Caroline] Well, the weather's turned,
but look at that view.

01:10:50.705 --> 01:10:52.625
You don't get a view like
that in London, do you?

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.083
[Joanna] No, you don't.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.251
[Chuckles softly]

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:59.422
What about you, Megan?
You ever been to London?

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:00.882
A few times.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:05.052
I really love the energy,
but it's a little too busy for me.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.138
Everyone has their favorite place,

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:10.558
but it's often accompanied
by their favorite person.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:16.314
Hmm. Don't you agree, dad?

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:19.609
If you're in your perfect place,
it's best to be with somebody you love?

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.194
[Paulina] I know what you mean.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:24.864
There's no point being in paradise
if you've no one to share it with.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:27.617
Yes. Quite.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:31.537
What about you, little sister?
Have you been enjoying the sights?

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:35.750
Very much. Very much indeed.

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:24.048
No, actually.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.885
Yeah, he's bought himself this...

Beautiful little beach house

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:32.557

That's a pity.

Anyway, I've got
some great news for you.

Your old boss Michael,
he called this morning.

He wants you to be chief editor
of the new magazine he's launching!

to this island years ago...

I don't think I believed in anything.

There is no more beautiful time

from the birth of a child

We are all the product
of a father and a mother.

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:01.098
And no matter the circumstances
of our birth,

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:04.477
we all breathe in the miracle of life

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:07.480
and the goodness of god.

You may travel to a faraway place,

you may have dreams

that take you along an unknown path,

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:21.702
you may find love there, or hope...

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:28.959
But you never let go
of the memories of family

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:31.879
that lies locked here in your heart.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:38.094
You never let go of the love
you have for them.

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:42.807
And even when we get older,

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:48.020
we Cherish and hold on to the memories
that we share with one another.

And those memories, we hope,
will never fade away.

as one family tonight,

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:26.512
And we're going to visit too.
Peter's thrilled at the idea.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.699
Of course, I am going to have
to stock up on sunscreen,

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:31.163
because he's almost as pale as I am.

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:32.518
And what about you?

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.145
Do you have some reason
for returning to the island

01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:37.856
other than to see your dear old dad?

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:42.820
Let's just say I have my reasons.

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:43.946
- [James] Ah.
- Hmm.

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.406
Hmm.

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:46.699
You're sure about this?

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:47.950
- Yep.
- Yes, we are.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.118
Hmm.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:54.081
Family need to stick together. Agreed?

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:55.416
[Both] Agreed.

01:19:57.918 --> 01:19:59.169
You girls...

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.428
Yes, I agree.

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.114
- Merry Christmas! [Chuckles]
- [All] Yay!

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:10.431
[All laughing]

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:25.171
[Caroline] Are you sure you're going to be
okay until we get back?

01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:27.865
I promise. Everything will be fine.

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:31.452
I'm sure Chloe's going to love it here.

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.078
I'm so proud of you.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:37.188
It seems someone has come
to say goodbye to the real Paulina.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.168
What?

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.005
[James] Go on.
She's waiting for you.

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:53.807
[Chuckles softly]

01:20:56.018 --> 01:21:00.022
So this is what the real Paulina
iookshke.

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:03.400
Yes. Sorry.

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:08.364
It's not quite as dramatic as Janis,

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.783
or the Beatles, for that matter.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.493
I wanted to give you something.

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:20.334
Thank you.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:32.763
I'll be waiting for you.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.726
I have to go.

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:45.526
[James chuckles]

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:48.445
[Quietly] All right.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.449
Well, it's time to say goodbye.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:56.036
Come on, let's have a hug.
[Chuckles]

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.621
- Love you.
- Love you too.

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.751
[James] All right, you two.
Have a good trip.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:06.004
- We'll see you soon. [Chuckles]
- [Paulina] Bye.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:08.090

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.556
- [Boat engine revving]
- [James chuckles]

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:20.686
Off they go. And floor it.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:23.355
[Caroline] Bye! We love you.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.655
[James chuckles]
That was pretty great.

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:42.291
- It'll be okay.
- Yes, I know.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:47.254
- I can't believe we're leaving dad.
- I know.

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:48.755
It was a really special time.

01:22:49.756 --> 01:22:51.049
I love you.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:53.886
- [Phone ringing]
- Oh!

01:22:55.762 --> 01:22:58.974
- It's Jackie.
- Why is she calling?

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:03.020
Jackie? No, we just left him.

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:06.899
What?! No!

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.609
- What?
- No!

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:10.360
- We have to go back!
- Why?!

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:12.154
We have to go back! Turn around!

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:13.947
- Why?
- We have to go back!

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:16.200
Why?! Turn the boat around!

01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:18.410
- What?!
- [Paulina] Turn the boat around!

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:23.665
What are they doing?

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.251
[Paulina] Wait there, wait there!

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.295
[Caroline] We're coming!

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:31.465
[Both continue yelling excitedly]

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:32.799
[James] I don't know. I mean...

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.595
Dad! Dad!

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.722
- What?
- What?

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:42.809
Jackie called. She's pregnant!

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:44.144
[Gasps]

01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:46.355
You're going to be
father Christmas again!

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:48.857
Oh, boy.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:52.486
[All squeal and laugh]

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:57.533
- [Joanna] Daddy!
- [Indistinct chatter]

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.284
Look at you. Oh, my god.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.036
Maybe we'll have a boy this time.
