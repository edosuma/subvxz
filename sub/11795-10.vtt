( bell rings )

00:04.571 --> 00:07.207
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.240 --> 00:10.076
    <i>* I don't think</i>
    <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.110 --> 00:13.013
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
  <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:13.046 --> 00:16.616
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
  <i>just in time to</i>
  <i>see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.649 --> 00:22.222
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.255 --> 00:25.325
   <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
   <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:28.294
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>

01:20.480 --> 01:22.816
 Welcome to the school store.

01:22.849 --> 01:25.285
Also known as
"Nerds 'R' Us."

01:28.421 --> 01:30.724
Poor Kelly,
she works here.

01:32.992 --> 01:35.829
 Herbert, Ronald,
 they're here!

01:37.464 --> 01:40.100
 Hey, what are those?
 Fluorescent pocket protectors?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.368
   Exactly.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.136
  They are?

01:43.169 --> 01:45.839
Why do we need
pocket protectors
that glow in the dark?

01:45.872 --> 01:48.441
  To wear with our
  pajamas, of course.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.879
   Isn't that just
   the slightest bit dorky?

01:52.912 --> 01:56.783
   Hey, don't judge us!
   Don't you dare judge us!

01:56.816 --> 01:58.118
   Guys, do you really think

01:58.151 --> 02:00.720
we're going to sell
any of those... things?

02:00.754 --> 02:04.057
  Employee vote. Who wants
  to send them back?

02:04.057 --> 02:05.925
  Me.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.093
   Who wants to keep them?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.261
   All: Us!

02:09.429 --> 02:12.298
  You lose.
  Go dust something.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.235
   Kelly,
   why don't you just quit?

02:15.268 --> 02:16.236
  I can't. I need the money.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.438
 Let me tell you,
 you won't have this job long.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.074
  These guys couldn't sell
  a mouse to a starving cat.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.444
Hey, guys.
We're going to The Max.
You guys want to come?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.346
 I get off in
 five minutes.

02:26.379 --> 02:28.948
We'll wait. Maybe we'll
find something to buy.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.417
  Or maybe we won't.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.085
  Wow, look at this.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.320
Does this puzzle really
have a million pieces?

02:37.590 --> 02:40.994
  No. I think your head's
  short a few pieces.

02:43.363 --> 02:46.433
 Hey, Slater, look at this
 autographed picture of Mr.
 Rogers.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.468
   ( siren blares )

02:50.570 --> 02:52.839
 That is not for sale!

02:52.872 --> 02:54.307
  Feet apart and spread 'em.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.942
  Hey, I wasn't shoplifting.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.977
  Oh? And what
  do you call these?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.046
   Muscles.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.283
 I got them by
 bench-pressing nerds.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.123
Kelly, look what they have
turned this place into.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.859
No wonder nobody
comes in here anymore.

03:12.892 --> 03:16.229
  There's nothing in here
  any normal person
  would want to buy.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.565
   Hey, how much
   is this?

03:19.966 --> 03:22.235
All right, somebody has got
to convince Belding

03:22.268 --> 03:24.237
 to put this place
 under new management,

03:24.270 --> 03:25.905
   or you're gonna
   be out of a job.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.807
 Yeah, somebody
 who's clever enough.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.478
  Somebody who can wrap Belding
  around his little finger.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.981
  Well, I guess we all know
  who that person is.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.484
   Okay, I'll do it.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.353
  ( laughs )

03:40.387 --> 03:42.288
 Put you in charge
 of the school store?

03:42.322 --> 03:44.290
  Why don't you just
  have me bumped off?

03:44.324 --> 03:46.459
  At least that would
  be quicker.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.128
That's ridiculous, sir.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.964
 I could never afford a hit man
 on my allowance.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.535
   Zack, the school store
   is in good hands.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.304
 Sir, they're selling
 refrigerator magnets

03:58.338 --> 04:00.940
  made out of used retainers.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.510
 I'm sure you're
 exaggerating.

04:03.543 --> 04:07.347
Their best seller
is flesh-colored
Band-Aids for nerds...

04:07.380 --> 04:09.315
  extra pale.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.418
 Morris, I can't just fire them

04:11.451 --> 04:13.553
 because you don't like
 what they're selling.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.588
  Oh, really?

04:15.622 --> 04:19.259
Here are last month's
sales figures.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.295
  This paper's blank.

04:22.328 --> 04:25.865
 Wow, sir.
 Nothing gets by you.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.234
  You know you've proven
  that people over 40

04:28.268 --> 04:29.869
 still belong in a workplace?

04:32.072 --> 04:34.140
   Mr. Belding,
   you've got to fire them.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.508
 I don't know, Zack.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.976
   Give me a week
   to run the store

04:37.077 --> 04:39.646
 and I guarantee you
 a big profit.

04:39.679 --> 04:44.617
  And the school board
  will be very happy for you.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.320
   All right, Zack.
   One week.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.222
   But we can't be
   cruel about this,

04:49.255 --> 04:51.991
  so please ask Herbert, Ronald
  and Norman to
  come to my office.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.394
Of course, sir.

04:54.427 --> 04:58.198
   Will the three dweebs
   who used to run
   the school store

04:58.231 --> 05:00.233
  please report
  to the principal's office?

05:00.266 --> 05:03.236
 Give me that.

05:03.269 --> 05:06.239
  All right.
  Screech, throw the switch!

05:07.640 --> 05:09.376
 Wow, this place
 looks great!

05:09.409 --> 05:12.312
You did it, Zack.
Thanks!

05:12.345 --> 05:15.615
   Okay, this is it.
   We're ready to
   do some business.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.351
   Screech, open the doors.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.355
Ahh!
Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

05:22.389 --> 05:24.657
  This will always be
  our store.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.393
  We're not leaving!

05:29.562 --> 05:31.965
Screech, call security.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.067
   Security!

05:37.237 --> 05:40.173
   Uh-oh, guys.
   It's the big one.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.942
It's three against one,
Slater.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.079
 Aah!

05:46.079 --> 05:48.081
   We'll get you back for this,
   cheerleader.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.984
 Next time you say, "Stand up,
 sit down, fight-fight-fight,"

05:51.084 --> 05:53.453
 we're just going
 to sit there and do nothing.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.522
 ( growling )

05:57.357 --> 06:00.026
Okay, guys,
let's make some money.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.428
  Don't we need
  customers for that?

06:01.461 --> 06:03.630
   Hey, no one wants
   to come in here anymore.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.332
  Yeah, you're right.
  What we need is a gimmick.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.535
Hey guys, we need to get
to swim team practice.

06:08.568 --> 06:11.504
  Hey, Jessie, if you wore
  your bathing suit
  here in the store,

06:11.538 --> 06:14.441
   believe me,
   you'd attract attention.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.043
 Why don't you
 pack yourself in ice?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.079
 That's cool.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.116
  I gotta go, too.
  Photo club.

06:23.149 --> 06:24.584
Bingo!

06:24.617 --> 06:26.219
Oh, no.
That's Saturday night.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.289
 Screech, go get
 your camera.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.758
   We're gonna take pictures
   of the girls in the pool.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.693
 What if I get caught?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.529
 Trust me,
 they'll never
 know you were there.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.405
   Screech,
   did you get the pictures?

06:48.308 --> 06:50.710
  Yeah, I got 'em.
  What are they for, anyway?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.747
Screech,
the <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
<i>Swimsuit Issue</i>

06:53.780 --> 06:57.083
   is the biggest
   seller of the year.
   You know what that means?

06:57.083 --> 06:58.518
 Yeah.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.488
 But just tell me
 so I can make sure you know.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.123
 Yeah.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.325
The school store
will be the only place

07:05.358 --> 07:07.327
   where you can get
   your very own...

07:07.360 --> 07:09.529
 "Girls of Bayside" calendar.

07:09.562 --> 07:13.033
 While they're buying that,
 they'll buy other things.
 Get it?

07:13.066 --> 07:16.569
 Zack, let me say it's an honor
 working with
 a slimeball like you.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.038
  Thank you.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.442
  "Girls of Bayside" calendars!
  Get 'em while they're hot!

07:26.813 --> 07:29.215
 Hey, watch it.
 They're here.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.584
 Zack, this is great.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.354
  Yeah, but why are all
  the customers guys?

07:34.387 --> 07:36.156
Does it really matter?

07:36.189 --> 07:37.757
   All that matters
   is they're here.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.260
  That is a very good attitude,
  Jessie.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.828
 Slater: All right, five bucks.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.296
 ( screaming )

07:44.698 --> 07:47.567
Wow, Jessie,
that is a great
picture of you.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.703
Yeah, very flattering.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.771
 ( screaming )

07:54.874 --> 07:56.309
  You didn't have the right!

07:56.343 --> 07:57.477
  You didn't ask permission!

07:57.510 --> 08:00.447
 You didn't get
 my good side!

08:02.082 --> 08:06.019
Girls, try to understand.
I had to
promote the calendars.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.687
  Oh, the calendars.

08:08.355 --> 08:11.157
  Calendars?!

08:11.191 --> 08:16.062
  Thanks to you, it'll be July
  in my house all year long.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
   Hey, five bucks.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.571
 You can pay me later.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.074
 Lisa, you're October,

08:28.541 --> 08:29.776
I'm November?

08:29.809 --> 08:31.578
   Who's December?

08:31.611 --> 08:33.712
 Mr. Belding
 is December?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.551
  Ho, ho, ho.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.687
   There's only 11 girls
   on the swim team,

08:40.720 --> 08:43.523
 so we put Belding's head
 on one of the girl's bodies.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.692
   That is my body.

08:45.725 --> 08:49.129
Ugh! I'm gonna dream
about Belding tonight.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.699
This was all your idea,
wasn't it?

08:52.732 --> 08:54.401
 You want me in a bathing suit?

08:54.434 --> 08:55.669
 You got me!
Wait a min...

08:57.737 --> 09:00.707
 Zack, you pull these calendars
 off the shelves right now.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.275
No way.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.777
 All right.
 Then we're just going

09:03.810 --> 09:05.445
 to get someone
 else to settle this.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.247
 Mr. Belding.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.516
Don't you mean
Miss December?

09:11.484 --> 09:13.653
   Ladies, let's go.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.722
 Goodbye,
 Miss October.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.897
   Zack, it was a good idea
   to get business,

09:23.930 --> 09:25.932
  but you had no right
  to do this.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.134
 This calendar is
 exploitive and cheap.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.338
   Hey, it's not cheap.
   It's five bucks!

09:31.371 --> 09:34.407
  Zack, I want every one
  of these calendars

09:34.441 --> 09:36.443
recalled
and destroyed.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.877
 But, sir...

09:37.911 --> 09:39.079
 ( knocking )

09:39.112 --> 09:41.114
  Excuse me.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.149
  Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.385
 I'm looking for the person
 responsible for this calendar.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.355
Zack Morris.
He's all yours.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.390
  Hi, I'm Adam Trask.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.059
  I'm a photographer
  with <i>Teen Fashion</i> magazine.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.361
   This is a great calendar.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.396
It is?

09:56.429 --> 09:59.065
 Hey, he should know.
 He's a professional.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.067
   Hey, Mr. Trask,
   how're you doing?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.902
  How'd you find out
  about the calendar?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.471
  A friend of mine
  owns the print-shop

10:04.504 --> 10:06.206
  where the calendars
  were put together.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.107
You all look familiar.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.276
Well, Kelly, Lisa
and Jessie are in here,

10:10.310 --> 10:13.480
   and you could've seen
   Zack's picture in
   any post office.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.983
 You look familiar to me, too.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.152
   Me?
   I don't know how.

10:19.185 --> 10:22.355
I'm doing a photo spread
on high school fashion,

10:22.389 --> 10:25.558
   and I think
   the "Girls of Bayside"
   would be perfect.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.961
 Excuse me,
 but the true beauty of a woman

10:27.994 --> 10:29.963
cannot be captured
with a camera.

10:29.996 --> 10:33.266
   Well, these photos will be
   seen all over the world.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.101
   Although they're
   doing incredible

10:35.135 --> 10:37.871
  things with
  cameras these days.

10:37.904 --> 10:41.307
 See,
 I need to pick three, but I'm
 having a tough time deciding.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.580
  Mr. Trask, I could tell you
  who the best models are...

10:47.614 --> 10:50.216
if I wanted to.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.421
 Sell those calendars, Zackie.

10:54.454 --> 10:58.091
 Miss October, Miss July
 and Miss November, right here.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.260
  Okay, you're hired.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.195
I'm glad you didn't mention
Miss December.

11:02.228 --> 11:05.165
 Now there's a dog
 without a tail. Woof!

11:07.067 --> 11:09.069
 Who was Miss December,
 anyway?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.603
  Oh, it's not important, sir.
  No...

11:10.637 --> 11:12.339
   Hey, she's kind of cute.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.075
  Well, we gotta go.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.476
 See ya. Bye.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.877
  Thank you.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.079
   You're welcome.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.450
Morris!

11:24.451 --> 11:26.453
 Girls, let's make it happen.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.556
   Jessie, studious,
   yet fashionable.

11:32.992 --> 11:35.095
   All right, school's out!

11:35.128 --> 11:37.931
Glasses off, hair down.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.100
  Yeah, wind.
  Give me wind, Rob.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.702
 Yeah, whoa.
 There it is.

11:43.737 --> 11:47.540
 Kelly, the All-American girl!

11:49.209 --> 11:52.379
  Yes, yes, be perky.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.416
  Okay, Lisa!
  Hip and happening!

11:56.449 --> 11:58.451
   Trendy, trendier,

11:58.485 --> 11:59.686
  trendiest!

12:01.554 --> 12:03.523
Yeah, Lisa, you look...

12:03.556 --> 12:05.492
 you look really nice.
 That's great.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.094
  Yeah, that's good.
  Pretty smile. Good.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.330
Kelly!

12:10.363 --> 12:13.233
Yeah. Come on!

12:21.107 --> 12:23.376
   All right, Kelly,
   let's go!

12:27.414 --> 12:29.282
 Okay, Jessie!

12:39.726 --> 12:41.661
  Okay, everybody, move in now.
  Here we go.

12:41.695 --> 12:44.497
  All three!
  Yes, great!

12:46.232 --> 12:48.568
 I wonder if Adam's coming.
 He said he'd meet
 us before school.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.404
I know, I can't wait to see
which pictures he used.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.641
Hey, look who
we bumped into.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.711
  Whoa! Check out these
  hot-looking girls.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.246
   How do I look?
   I mean, we look?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.182
   See for yourself.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.516
 Hey, these look pretty good.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.951
Yeah!

13:05.051 --> 13:08.221
   Give me those
   negatives, mama!

13:08.254 --> 13:09.689
  Now, for the really
  good news.

13:09.723 --> 13:12.325
 You want me to pose
 for an underwear ad?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.494
Uh, no.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.262
   My editor saw the photos,

13:16.296 --> 13:18.164
and he wants one of you
for the cover

13:18.198 --> 13:20.467
   of our special
   anniversary issue
   of <i>Teen Fashion.</i>

13:20.500 --> 13:22.068
   Y  Oh my God!g!

13:22.102 --> 13:24.637
 Okay, okay.
 No matter who it is,
 no one can get upset.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.339
   Agreed.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.109
   Okay, the lucky girl
   is Kelly.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.610
Kelly?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.245
  With those hips?!

13:32.278 --> 13:34.114
 What hips, shorty?!

13:34.147 --> 13:35.782
   ( all shouting )

13:35.815 --> 13:38.618
 Okay, okay! Girls, girls,
 retract those claws.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.154
  ( hisses )

13:43.356 --> 13:45.658
   Come on, you all agreed
   not to get upset.

13:45.692 --> 13:46.726
 Both: We lied.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.731
 We're sorry.

13:51.765 --> 13:54.601
 Yeah, congratulations,
 Kelly.

13:54.634 --> 13:55.835
   I don't know what to say.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.171
  I've never expected
  anything like this.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.840
  It's a wonderful opportunity,
  Kelly.
  Congratulations.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.243
  Yeah, most of us
  are happy for you.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.378
I haven't gotten
to the best part, yet.

14:05.412 --> 14:09.783
 Our anniversary issue theme is
 "American Girls in Paris."

14:09.816 --> 14:11.351
Paris?

14:11.384 --> 14:16.222
 Whoa!
 Paris, Texas... the big time.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.092
   Paris, France.
   Who is this kid?

14:19.125 --> 14:20.760
  All: I don't know.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.762
   Anyway, Kelly,
   look over this itinerary,

14:22.796 --> 14:24.330
   and if it's okay
   with your folks,

14:24.364 --> 14:25.732
  you're off to
  Paris for a month.

14:25.765 --> 14:29.502
  A month?
  Well,
  Zack, isn't this fantastic?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.705
   Yeah, fantastic.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.774
   Kelly, this will change
   your whole life.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.510
You know, Jessie's right.
lf Kelly goes to Paris,

14:37.544 --> 14:39.179
   she'll forget
   about me forever.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.348
  I've got to find some way
  to make her stay.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.221
  Wow, look at this schedule!

14:48.254 --> 14:50.223
 The first week you're shooting
 at the Eiffel Tower,

14:50.256 --> 14:52.692
   then the Champs-Elysees,
   then the Louvre,

14:52.726 --> 14:54.728
  and then a week on a yacht.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.663
I can't believe it.
All of a sudden

14:56.696 --> 14:58.631
   I'm a model going
   to work in Paris.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.934
   The sights,
   the great food...

15:01.034 --> 15:04.838
  The cute guys in French jeans
  named Marc-Paul.

15:04.871 --> 15:08.641
   Wow, I have so much to do
   before I leave tomorrow.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.945
  Tomorrow?!

15:12.045 --> 15:14.047
   Look, I don't like what
   I'm about to do,

15:14.047 --> 15:18.651
 but desperate times
 call for desperate measures.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.587
   Kelly,
   you're leaving tomorrow?

15:20.620 --> 15:23.590
   Well, what about
   the swim meet on Friday?

15:23.623 --> 15:26.826
 I was so
 wrapped up in the trip
 I completely forgot.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.862
  So did we.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.897
 Jessie, what are
 we gonna do?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.166
  Without Kelly swimming anchor
  in the relay race,

15:33.199 --> 15:34.801
we don't have a chance.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.569
   Well, don't worry, Kelly.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.673
  We'll just get
  Harriet Hippleman
  to take her place.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.541
  Harriet weights
  200 pounds.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.145
   She can't swim anchor.
   She is an anchor.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.746
Well, come on.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.648
  We've got to find somebody
  who swims as fast as Kelly.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.250
   I'm really sorry
   about this, guys.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.085
 Yeah.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.624
   So Slater, who are you going
   to do your
   science project with

15:57.657 --> 15:59.092
   now that Kelly's leaving?

15:59.092 --> 16:00.093
What?

16:00.126 --> 16:01.194
 Hey, Kelly,

16:01.227 --> 16:03.196
 you're not going
 to be here next week?

16:03.229 --> 16:05.899
  Oh, nice, Slater.
  Make her feel
  guilty for leaving.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.535
 It's not Kelly's fault
 that you're a dud in science.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.036
 What are you talking about?

16:10.036 --> 16:11.638
  Are you really
  doing that poorly?

16:11.671 --> 16:16.142
 Hey, he's doing so bad
 he copies off of me.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.044
   Don't worry about it, Kelly.
   It's okay.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.579
  I'll find another partner.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.587
   Hey, Screech, come here.
   I need your help.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.890
  I have to cry in drama,
  so show me that
  great cry of yours.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.759
 Okay.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.828
   ( cries )

16:36.196 --> 16:37.230
  How's that, Zack?

16:37.263 --> 16:38.298
 Keep it up.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.300
  ( crying )

16:40.333 --> 16:41.835
It's okay. It's okay.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.103
 ( sobbing )

16:45.338 --> 16:47.173
 What's the matter
 with Screech?

16:47.207 --> 16:48.975
Don't feel bad, Kelly,

16:49.075 --> 16:51.077
   but I just told
   him you're going

16:51.077 --> 16:53.079
  to miss his
  birthday next week.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.915
   Gosh, I feel like I'm
   disappointing everybody.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.584
  Except you.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.720
 Not for long.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.889
  Zack, Kelly,
  I've got to hand it to you.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.258
 You two have really turned
 this place around.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.093
   We'd be doing
   even better, sir,

17:07.127 --> 17:10.797
 if you'd let us
 sell the calendars
 without December ripped out.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.133
I just figured that my head
on Jessie's body

17:13.165 --> 17:16.869
was not the best way
to say Merry Christmas.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.039
 I put together
 some assignments
 to keep you caught up

17:19.039 --> 17:21.875
 with your classes
 while you're gone.
 I hope you have a great trip.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.108
   Thanks.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.045
   We're gonna miss
   her right, Zack?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.881
   Yeah. We'll get by.
   At least we have
   each other, sir.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.851
  Hurry back.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.887
  Hey, guys.
  How about lunch at The Max?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.822
 You know,
 a farewell
 lunch before you go.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.625
  Hey, that's a great idea,
  isn't it, Kel?

17:38.658 --> 17:41.061
 Well, I don't...
 gee, I'd love to, but I can't.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.295
 Well, sure you can.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.897
  No,
  I have to go home and pack,

17:43.930 --> 17:46.266
  and I've got that promotional
  shoot this afternoon.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.068
 Oh, thaYeah.oo bad.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.369
  In honor of
  your trip to France

17:49.402 --> 17:50.837
   we were going to
   have some pizza.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.377
  Guys, I'm really sorry,
  but I've got to go.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.380
 Kelly, wait.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.748
Look...

18:01.781 --> 18:03.216
  since you can't
  have lunch with us,

18:03.249 --> 18:05.652
  I'll just invite them
  to the photo shoot.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.020
  That's a great idea, Zack.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.022
Tell them I'll
seem them there, okay?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.293
Too bad she
couldn't come with us.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.161
 Why can't we go to the shoot?

18:15.195 --> 18:17.630
  That's what I just asked her.
  She said no way.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.933
   It's very unprofessional.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.737
 Okay!
 You're happy,

18:23.770 --> 18:27.040
   excited!
   Terrific!

18:27.040 --> 18:28.742
Okay now be
your own woman.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.845
 You're strong,
 you're independent. That's it.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.814
 All right,
 now get wild.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.850
You're impulsive,
you're daring.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.885
 You're unpredictable.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.920
 Oh. Hi, Zack.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.323
  I should have
  stopped at daring.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.092
You two can visit
while I reload.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.260
   Thanks.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.395
  Save 'em.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.464
  Where is everybody?

18:51.498 --> 18:53.700
  They're not coming.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.769
   Why not?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.804
 Well, Kelly,

18:57.837 --> 19:00.006
 the girls are real mad
 about the swim meet.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.208
 Slater's bummed about
 the science project.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.177
 And Screech,

19:04.210 --> 19:06.780
  well, he's gonna forget about
  his birthday this year.

19:07.781 --> 19:09.916
All right.
Move it, hunk.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.386
Okay, boys and girls,
let's get busy.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.755
   All right, Kelly.
   You're carefree,

19:15.789 --> 19:18.224
 you're light as a feather.
 No worries.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.360
 Oh, hey, come on,
 brighten up.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.697
   Smile.
   It's a great day.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.032
Okay, hold it.

19:28.802 --> 19:30.403
  Kelly, are you
  all right?

19:30.437 --> 19:32.038
 Yeah.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.176
 Uh, no, Adam.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.713
   I just can't go to Paris.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.915
Kelly!

19:41.948 --> 19:43.116
What's wrong with her?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.786
  What did you
  say to her?

19:46.820 --> 19:47.854
   Nothing.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.489
Zack.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.324
  I've seen this before.
  You think
  if Kelly goes off to Paris,

19:51.358 --> 19:53.827
 she's going to
 become a big model
 and forget about you.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.296
 Huh. Forget about
 Zack Morris?

19:59.132 --> 20:01.935
Okay,
so I don't want her to go.
What's wrong with that?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.803
  What's wrong?
  You just took away

20:03.837 --> 20:05.472
the biggest
opportunity of her life

20:05.505 --> 20:07.874
  because you were afraid
  you were going to lose her.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.343
Man, she's lucky
to have a guy like you.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.082
   Hey, look, kid...

20:16.116 --> 20:19.085
 Kelly's a very
 special girl.

20:19.119 --> 20:20.787
  You like her a lot,
  don't you?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.957
 Yeah.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.292
 Then why not let her
 choose her own path?

20:27.994 --> 20:31.131
I have a feeling it'll lead
back to you anyway.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.473
   ( phone ringing )

20:40.507 --> 20:42.976
<i>Hi, this is Lisa.</i>
<i>I'm not home right now,</i>

20:43.009 --> 20:45.378
   <i>but if you're good looking</i>
   <i>and have a big allowance,</i>

20:45.412 --> 20:46.479
   <i>leave a message.</i>

20:46.513 --> 20:48.248
  ( beeps )

20:48.281 --> 20:50.917
 Hi, it's Kelly.
 We really need to talk, okay?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.152
   Call me?

20:55.622 --> 20:58.091
   ( phone ringing )

21:01.928 --> 21:03.963
   Come on, Jessie, answer.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.366
 ( knocking )

21:06.399 --> 21:07.600
   Come in.

21:10.070 --> 21:11.604
 Hi.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.340
 Hi.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.344
   Uh, look, Kelly,

21:17.377 --> 21:19.379
 I have something to tell you.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.082
Let me guess...

21:22.115 --> 21:24.284
   not only do my friends
   think I'm awful,

21:24.317 --> 21:26.586
but Adam thinks
I'm awful, too.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.088
 Was he mad?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.356
Yeah.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.159
But not at you,
at me.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.261
   You? Why?

21:36.229 --> 21:38.264
Because I lied.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.266
   I never invited the guys
   to the shoot.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.203
 And I've been trying to make
 you feel guilty for leaving.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.604
   Kelly, I'm sorry.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.107
 Why would you do
 something like that?

21:47.107 --> 21:49.109
   I'm only going to be
   gone for a month.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.545
Do you know how long
that is in teen years?

21:52.579 --> 21:55.181
 Kelly, I thought you'd
 become famous and...

21:55.215 --> 21:57.283
   Forget about you?

21:57.317 --> 22:00.620
   There is no way
   I can compete with Paris.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.124
  Zack, there is no way
  Paris can compete with you.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.960
   Do you mean that?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.669
 Good answer.

22:15.702 --> 22:19.305
Listen,
if you don't want me to go,
just say so.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.375
   I want you to go.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.111
   Good, 'cause I was going
   to go anyway.

22:25.145 --> 22:26.946
   You were?

22:26.980 --> 22:29.683
  I guess you'll never know.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.485
   Yeah, I guess
   I deserved that.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.554
   Have a great time, Kelly.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.922
   You know,

22:35.955 --> 22:40.293
 I wish I could
 spend some more time
 with the gang before I leave.

22:40.326 --> 22:42.595
   You want it, you got it!

22:42.629 --> 22:44.698
 Guys!

22:44.731 --> 22:46.099
   Right on. Ta-da!

22:46.132 --> 22:47.600
   All: <i>Bon voyage!</i>

22:53.506 --> 22:56.109
 ( instrumental music plays )
