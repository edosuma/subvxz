We're here.

let me ask you guys something, man.

Are they gonna keep taking
our Confederate statues down or what?

01:34.719 --> 01:36.513

-[man] Yeah!

01:37.889 --> 01:39.808
[laughter]

01:41.768 --> 01:43.603
Just taking the temperature of the room.

01:43.686 --> 01:46.439

-[laughter]

01:46.523 --> 01:47.732
[groans disgustedly]

01:48.817 --> 01:52.320
-"That's a weird one to start." All right.
-[laughter]

01:52.403 --> 01:55.073
Yeah, I've been on this,
uh, phenomenal tour,

01:55.156 --> 01:58.660
and I've, uh, I've met people
I never thought I would meet in my life.

01:58.743 --> 02:02.789
Recently I met a supermodel,
which is wild because…

02:02.872 --> 02:06.167
Well, I don't think she wanted to meet me.
I should be clear.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.963
I was in a… a fancy hotel in Toronto,

02:10.046 --> 02:14.050
and somebody that worked there,
they go to her, "Hey, he's a comedian."

02:14.134 --> 02:15.635
And she was like, "Okay."

02:15.718 --> 02:17.262
[laughter]

02:17.345 --> 02:20.598
And then they go, "She's a supermodel."
I was like, "I can see."

02:20.682 --> 02:22.183
[laughter]

02:22.267 --> 02:25.770
And what struck me is that they are
so much better-looking

02:25.854 --> 02:27.772
than you think they're gonna be.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.275
Like, you see in a magazine
or on your phone,

02:30.358 --> 02:32.193
and you're like, "She's pretty."

02:32.277 --> 02:35.572
But in person, you're like, "What the fuck
is happening right now?"

02:35.655 --> 02:36.739
[laughter]

02:36.823 --> 02:40.243
And then you realize
that it's a genetic freak.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.494
[crowd chuckles]

02:41.578 --> 02:44.956
It is. If you are a supermodel,
you are a freak.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.002
You are no different
than a seven-foot-tall man.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.045
-[laughter]
-I don't know

02:51.129 --> 02:55.341
if you've ever met a seven-footer.
I have. It is unsettling. All right?

02:56.134 --> 02:59.762
You basically… you go, like,
"Am I a child? What… What is happening?"

03:01.472 --> 03:02.891
This woman

03:02.974 --> 03:05.977
was so unbelievably good-looking.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.605
Like, five seconds into our conversation,

03:08.688 --> 03:11.524
I stopped speaking and listening.
All right?

03:11.608 --> 03:12.525
[laughter]

03:12.609 --> 03:15.486
I was looking at her
like she was at the zoo.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.654
I was like…

03:16.738 --> 03:19.782
[laughter]

03:19.866 --> 03:22.744
I was like, "Let me see your ears."
Was looking for flaws.

03:22.827 --> 03:23.828
[laughter]

03:23.912 --> 03:25.872
She was absolutely perfect.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.498
And then my next thought was,

03:27.582 --> 03:31.044
"Why can't my wife just drown?"

03:31.127 --> 03:32.795
-You know?
-[laughter]

03:32.879 --> 03:34.505
[scattered applause]

03:39.928 --> 03:42.096
She knows. I told her. She knows.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.015
[laughter]

03:44.098 --> 03:46.726
She's like, "You know I can swim, right?"
"I know."

03:47.769 --> 03:51.940
"Doesn't matter if you can swim.
It matters if a jury believes you can."

03:52.023 --> 03:53.816
-So…
-[laughter]

03:58.988 --> 04:00.531
[snorts]

04:02.367 --> 04:06.079
I've, uh… I've been to
unbelievable places because of this job.

04:06.162 --> 04:09.249
It's… It's really crazy.
I've… I've seen amazing places.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.501
Been to Rome. Hong Kong.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.045
Machu Picchu. All because of this job.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.631
And then, there's other days.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.174
[crowd chuckling]

04:18.258 --> 04:20.677
Like, I had to go to Topeka, Kansas
to do a show.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.929
[laughter]

04:23.012 --> 04:26.557
We went because they bought tickets,
but we got the fuck out right away.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.643
[laughter]

04:28.726 --> 04:31.062
There was something cool
that happened there,

04:31.145 --> 04:32.647
which is that my show there

04:32.730 --> 04:34.482
was protested

04:34.565 --> 04:36.567
by the Westboro Baptist Church.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.568
Uh…

04:37.652 --> 04:39.904
-[mumbles]
-[cheers and applause]

04:43.533 --> 04:44.951
Don't know if you know them.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.619
Sometimes they're in the news.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.662
[crowd chuckles]

04:47.745 --> 04:51.541
If you're like, "Oh, really?
There's a church in the news? But why?"

04:51.624 --> 04:52.542
[laughter]

04:52.625 --> 04:55.962
Well, sometimes they also protest
dead soldiers' funerals,

04:56.045 --> 04:57.964
cool shit like that. And…

04:59.257 --> 05:02.468
I was backstage, and my tour manager
came in the room, he goes,

05:02.552 --> 05:06.264
"Westboro Baptist Church is here."
I was like, "To see the show? Really?"

05:06.347 --> 05:07.974
[laughter]

05:08.057 --> 05:10.310
And he was like, "No."

05:11.102 --> 05:12.478
Said, "They're protesting."

05:12.562 --> 05:15.690
And they were out front
with their dumb fuckin' signs.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.484
[crowd chuckling]

05:18.568 --> 05:20.945
Their homemade signs 'cause they're poor.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.323
-Uh…
-[laughter]

05:26.117 --> 05:29.078
They had signs made that said,
"Tom is a sinner."

05:29.162 --> 05:31.039
And I was like, "Yes."

05:31.122 --> 05:32.915
-[crowd cheering]
-[mumbles]

05:32.999 --> 05:33.875
Yeah.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.251
True.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.712
-[cheers fade]
-[scattered applause]

05:38.796 --> 05:41.382
Then they had, like,
real hateful signs too

05:41.466 --> 05:43.926
that said, uh, like, "God hates gays."

05:44.010 --> 05:46.262
But didn't say "gay."

05:46.345 --> 05:48.639
[laughter]

05:48.723 --> 05:50.016
It was another word.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.018
[laughter continues]

05:53.478 --> 05:55.855
[laughter swells]

05:55.938 --> 05:58.983
Your dad says it when the Cardinals lose.
You know, like, uh…

05:59.067 --> 06:01.986
-[laughter, cheering]
-[scattered applause]

06:03.446 --> 06:05.823
All right, your uncle.
Somebody says it. Uh…

06:05.907 --> 06:07.492
[laughter]

06:07.575 --> 06:08.951
I took offense.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.370
Not so much to the word

06:11.454 --> 06:12.622
as the implication.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.917
That God hates gays.
I don't think that's true.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.420
I think God has a people problem.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.465
There are too many people,

06:22.548 --> 06:26.177
and that is not gay people's fault.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.680
-[laughter]
-[cheers, applause]

06:31.349 --> 06:34.143
Because they butt fuck.
I have to spell everything out?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.645
[laughter]

06:35.728 --> 06:36.771
Jesus.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.400
You can nut as hard as you want
in somebody's ass

06:41.484 --> 06:44.570
over and over and over,

06:44.654 --> 06:47.406
and something will come out,
but it's not a baby.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.366
Uh…

06:49.325 --> 06:51.953
-[audience member whistles]
-[cheering]

06:52.036 --> 06:53.162
I mean…

06:53.246 --> 06:54.747
[cheering continues]

06:56.082 --> 06:58.417
Still worth taking a picture of,
I would argue.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.627
[laughter]

06:59.710 --> 07:02.505
Maybe give it a name.
It's not gonna live long. Uh…

07:02.588 --> 07:04.549
[hushed laughter]

07:04.632 --> 07:07.135
[laughter swells]

07:08.177 --> 07:09.512
I'm not gay, but…

07:10.721 --> 07:13.641
I am not above checking out a dude.
I'm serious.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.268
Like, if I'm at the beach

07:15.351 --> 07:17.562
and there's some super fucking, like…

07:17.645 --> 07:20.606
just yoked dude there,
I'll be like, "Hey."

07:20.690 --> 07:21.732
"Nice."

07:21.816 --> 07:23.651
[laughter]

07:23.734 --> 07:24.819
"Very nice."

07:25.820 --> 07:28.156
"What's your protein intake?
What do you do?"

07:29.157 --> 07:30.491
"Cardio and lift? Of course."

07:31.701 --> 07:35.121
Then a hot chick'll walk by.
"Get outta here. What are you doing?"

07:35.204 --> 07:36.706
[laughter]

07:39.709 --> 07:41.627
I think the gayest I ever was…

07:41.711 --> 07:44.297
[laughter]

07:44.380 --> 07:45.673
…was in February.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.425
[laughter]

07:47.508 --> 07:49.927
That's when I did my shows in Los Angeles

07:50.011 --> 07:53.097
and Brad Pitt came to my show.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.350
[cheers and applause]

07:56.434 --> 07:57.393
Look…

07:57.477 --> 08:00.229
I do not know what year he was born

08:00.313 --> 08:03.816
or how many infants he consumes in a week,
but that man…

08:03.900 --> 08:05.818
-[laughter]
-…is stunning. All right?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.155
He came into my dressing room.
I couldn't make eye contact.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.573
Do you understand?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.159
I was like, "Hey, what's up, man?
How you doing?"

08:13.242 --> 08:14.410
[laughter]

08:14.494 --> 08:16.829
He goes, "Look at me." I was like, "No."

08:16.913 --> 08:19.081
[laughter continues]

08:20.500 --> 08:22.710
He goes, "Come on." I said, "Shut up."

08:22.793 --> 08:24.378
[laughter]

08:27.548 --> 08:29.967
[laughter continues]

08:31.010 --> 08:33.387
He goes, "Wanna give me a kiss?"
I was like, "Yeah."

08:33.471 --> 08:35.973
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

08:37.141 --> 08:39.602
He goes, "Do it." I went…
Like that, I kissed him.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.521
-[laughter]
-What?

08:41.604 --> 08:46.108
-[crowd cheering]
-[audience member whistles]

08:48.277 --> 08:50.488
-It wasn't gay.
-[laughter]

08:50.571 --> 08:54.450
-We took a bath later. That was gay. But…
-[laughter]

08:54.534 --> 08:57.203
…we talked about sports,
so it balanced out, you know?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.498
I think you're lucky

09:00.581 --> 09:03.834
if, in this life, you have, like,
one real friend.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.545
You know? Like a true friend.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.421
I think I have four.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.839
-Brad Pitt…
-[laughter]

09:08.923 --> 09:10.383
Um…

09:10.466 --> 09:12.969
I call him Pitt Stop 'cause we're close.
Uh…

09:13.052 --> 09:14.554
[laughter]

09:14.637 --> 09:17.014
And three other guys.
People you know intimately.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.559
Like, you know
each other's secrets and stuff.

09:19.642 --> 09:23.396
Like, one of my friends,
I know that he hides that he smokes weed

09:23.479 --> 09:25.690
from his wife. His name is Casey.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.400
-Um…
-[laughter]

09:31.195 --> 09:34.115
One of my friends hides
that he eats McDonald's from his wife

09:34.198 --> 09:36.325
because he's fat, and his name is Charlie.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.369
[laughter]

09:38.452 --> 09:39.704
[laughs devilishly]

09:40.663 --> 09:42.873
I guess they know now, but, you know…

09:43.749 --> 09:48.045
It's wild when you find out something new
after knowing people that long.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.840
I've known these guys, like, 25, 30 years.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.634
And I found out last week,

09:53.718 --> 09:56.929
so 25 years into these friendships,

09:57.013 --> 09:59.432
that I'm the only one who eats ass.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.518
In that entire group. Isn't that…
crazy to you?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.561
Like…

10:03.644 --> 10:05.730
[cheers and applause]

10:10.651 --> 10:14.363
I guess I'm friends with a bunch
of third-graders. I don't know. Like…

10:14.447 --> 10:15.698
[laughter]

10:15.781 --> 10:19.535
One of the guys is newly in love too.
Justin. Newly in love.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.623
Usually newly in love people
are really on board, you know?

10:23.706 --> 10:26.083
Because everything's rainbows
and butterflies.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.918
Like, every day Justin's like…

10:28.002 --> 10:29.086
[giggles gleefully]

10:29.170 --> 10:30.546
[laughter]

10:30.630 --> 10:31.881
[softly] "I'm in love."

10:32.673 --> 10:35.134
I go, "That's great. Did you eat her ass?"

10:36.135 --> 10:37.887
He's like, "No."

10:38.554 --> 10:40.181
I said, "So you don't like her."

10:40.264 --> 10:42.016
[laughter]

10:42.099 --> 10:45.186
And he was like, "No, I do."
And I said, "No, you don't."

10:45.269 --> 10:46.520
[laughter]

10:46.604 --> 10:49.440
"If you did, you'd give her
the sweetest kiss of all."

10:49.523 --> 10:52.026
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

10:54.153 --> 10:58.032
-And he goes, "That's where she shits."
-[laughter]

10:58.616 --> 11:02.161
-I was like, "Yeah, don't do it then."
-[laughter]

11:03.704 --> 11:05.081
Wait a while, you know?

11:06.082 --> 11:09.126
Put her in a bath or something.
That's what I did with Brad. Now…

11:09.210 --> 11:10.836
[laughter]

11:10.920 --> 11:13.506
[cheers and applause]

11:17.385 --> 11:19.470
[applause fades]

11:19.553 --> 11:22.098
He goes, "You're gross."
I was like, "Whatever."

11:23.307 --> 11:26.811
And he said, "That's what a dog does."
I said, "Excuse me?"

11:26.894 --> 11:28.437
[laughter]

11:28.521 --> 11:31.357
He goes, "A dog licks its own ass."

11:31.440 --> 11:32.775
I said, "First of all,

11:32.858 --> 11:34.819
if I could lick my own ass,

11:35.986 --> 11:37.696
I wouldn't be on tour, all right?"

11:37.780 --> 11:39.240
[laughter]

11:39.323 --> 11:42.076
I would do it until a doctor
told me to stop.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.494
[laughter]

11:43.577 --> 11:45.663
He would have to sit me down
and be like,

11:45.746 --> 11:48.791
"You're not gonna have an ass soon
if you don't knock this off."

11:48.874 --> 11:50.251
[laughter]

11:50.334 --> 11:52.420
I'd be like, "But it feels good."

11:52.503 --> 11:54.839
[laughter]

11:54.922 --> 11:56.632
And he'd go, "I don't trust you."

11:57.299 --> 11:59.510
"Gonna put a cone around your neck."
I'd be like…

12:00.678 --> 12:03.597
"I can take it off with my paws." Okay…

12:03.681 --> 12:05.975
[laughter fades, swells]

12:06.058 --> 12:08.602
Sorry, that was very stupid.
I'm sorry. Now…

12:10.563 --> 12:14.024
I wish my dad was still here, you know?
He died a few months ago.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.319
And I understand it's part of life.
It happens to everybody.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.782
And, uh, you know, I… I just… I had never
visited somebody sick in the hospital.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.868
That was a new experience. It's strange.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.495
If you've never done it,
you get to the hospital

12:26.579 --> 12:29.748
and then somebody that works there
goes, "Are you here to see…"

12:29.832 --> 12:32.626
And you go, "Yeah." They go,
"They're gonna die soon."

12:32.710 --> 12:35.588
And you're like, "I thought so too.
That's why I came."

12:35.671 --> 12:36.505
[laughter]

12:36.589 --> 12:39.592
And then they go, "You can go in there
and watch that now."

12:39.675 --> 12:41.302
And you're like, "Thanks."

12:41.385 --> 12:42.553
[scattered laughter]

12:42.636 --> 12:45.514
Personally, I feel like
watching somebody die

12:45.598 --> 12:47.600
that you're not trying to kill…

12:48.976 --> 12:51.520
-is weird, you know?
-[laughter]

12:51.604 --> 12:54.607
Like, it's different if you have somebody
and you're like…

12:54.690 --> 12:57.026
[laughter]

12:57.109 --> 12:58.402
And they go, "I'm dying."

12:58.486 --> 13:01.280
Like, "I know. I want you dead.
That's why I'm doing this."

13:01.363 --> 13:03.157
Probably feels good. I don't know.

13:04.158 --> 13:09.038
I'm assuming it's a euphoric feeling
that you chase forever and ever. But…

13:09.830 --> 13:12.500
Ask Garth Brooks.
He'll tell you all about it. So…

13:12.583 --> 13:14.960
[loud cheering, applause]

13:20.132 --> 13:21.342
Come on.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.512
Where are the bodies, G?

13:24.595 --> 13:26.680
[cheering continues]

13:26.764 --> 13:27.806
Please.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.392
[cheering continues, fades]

13:30.476 --> 13:33.395
-Connect the dots. Now…
-[laughter]

13:33.479 --> 13:38.776
I will tell you this. I did have
a great conversation with my father.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.820
And I hope if you're ever
in that situation, you get it too.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.074
We had this great talk.
And then he just drops this on me.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.910
He goes, "You know
what I've never told you?"

13:47.993 --> 13:50.538
And I was like, "No. What?"

13:50.621 --> 13:53.249
And I was really hoping he was gonna say,
you know,

13:53.332 --> 13:55.501
"There's a treasure
buried in the backyard."

13:55.584 --> 13:56.835
[laughter]

13:56.919 --> 13:57.920
"It's for you."

13:58.963 --> 14:03.425
I go, "What have you never told me?"
He goes, "I like a full bush on a lady."

14:03.509 --> 14:06.262
And I was like, "What? What?"

14:06.345 --> 14:09.348
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

14:09.431 --> 14:11.350
He goes, "Your mother
keeps trimming hers."

14:11.433 --> 14:14.186
-I go, "Hey, what the fuck, man?"
-[laughter]

14:15.563 --> 14:17.856
I go, "Why are you telling me this?"

14:17.940 --> 14:21.735
-And he goes, "Who am I supposed to tell?"
-[laughter]

14:21.819 --> 14:24.446
I go, "The Lord.
You're about to meet him."

14:25.447 --> 14:28.909
And that was it. Then he said the "N" word
and then he died. [mumbles]

14:28.993 --> 14:32.121
-[laughter]
-[scattered cheers and applause]

14:34.206 --> 14:36.667
It was his last wish.

14:36.750 --> 14:37.751
All right?

14:39.003 --> 14:41.171
Yeah. Make-A-Wish was pissed.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.591
[laughter]

14:43.674 --> 14:47.386
They were like, "We don't do that."
I was like, "Well, maybe you should."

14:47.970 --> 14:50.431
If it was between saying that
or meeting Tom Brady,

14:50.514 --> 14:52.850
I'd be like, "Fuck Tom Brady.
I wanna say it."

14:52.933 --> 14:56.228
-[laughter]
-[scattered cheers and applause]

14:56.312 --> 14:58.981
[loud cheering]

15:02.067 --> 15:05.404
What really sucks about losing a parent
is when you have kids.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.866
'Cause you want your parents
to hang out with your kids, you know?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.118
Like, I have… I have two boys.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.287
They're six and three.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.247
And they are boys.

15:15.331 --> 15:19.084
Like, real "he/him"s,
if you know what I'm saying. Uh…

15:19.168 --> 15:21.003
[laughter]

15:23.213 --> 15:25.591
Don't worry, we asked them.
All right? [mumbles]

15:26.425 --> 15:29.428
They were like… [gruff] "Definitely."
We're like, "Oh, okay."

15:29.511 --> 15:30.763
"It's up to you."

15:31.889 --> 15:33.015
Now…

15:33.098 --> 15:35.142
[hushed laughter]

15:35.225 --> 15:37.519
-[laughter slowly builds]
-[scattered applause]

15:37.603 --> 15:40.940
[loud cheering and applause]

15:43.442 --> 15:46.779
Luckily, I have a cousin
that lives near me

15:46.862 --> 15:49.114
and he has two girls the same age.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.241
Six and three.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.078
So I get this wildly different experience

15:54.161 --> 15:56.580
up close and in person

15:56.664 --> 15:57.706
all the time.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.001
And these girls come over to my house.
My God.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.797
What did I do wrong where
I didn't get girls? These girls…

16:04.880 --> 16:06.799
they show up, and they're like,

16:06.882 --> 16:08.467
[softly] "Hello, Uncle Tommy."

16:08.550 --> 16:09.802
[laughter]

16:09.885 --> 16:11.971
I go, "Hello to you."

16:12.054 --> 16:13.389
[laughter]

16:13.472 --> 16:15.140
They go, "Where should we sit?"

16:16.725 --> 16:18.143
I go, "Try one of the chairs."

16:18.227 --> 16:20.479
[laughter]

16:21.188 --> 16:23.399
And they go, "We would like to color."

16:23.941 --> 16:25.109
I go, "Please."

16:25.192 --> 16:27.820
[laughter]

16:27.903 --> 16:29.863
And then they sit down

16:29.947 --> 16:31.907
and they fucking color.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.576
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

16:35.411 --> 16:38.038
An hour later, I can go into that room

16:38.122 --> 16:40.207
and they're like…
[humming pleasantly]

16:40.290 --> 16:42.584
[laughter]

16:44.378 --> 16:45.754
I go, "That's nice."

16:46.422 --> 16:47.798
"Where are my boys?"

16:47.881 --> 16:49.341
[laughter]

16:49.425 --> 16:50.926
"Are they in the house?"

16:51.927 --> 16:53.345
"Are they on the house?"

16:53.429 --> 16:54.680
[laughter]

16:54.763 --> 16:57.182
"Are they… Oh, they're on the street.
Fantastic."

16:58.475 --> 17:01.061
I go out, like, "What the hell
are you guys doing?"

17:01.145 --> 17:03.564
And they're like,
"We broke all the crayons…"

17:03.647 --> 17:05.149
[laughter]

17:05.232 --> 17:07.776
"…and we put 'em in the mailbox."
And I go…

17:07.860 --> 17:10.154
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

17:10.237 --> 17:12.197
"Thank you. Thanks for doing that."

17:12.281 --> 17:14.658
[cheers and applause]

17:15.659 --> 17:17.661
[audience member whistles]

17:18.412 --> 17:20.789
My six-year-old, he goes,
"What would you do

17:20.873 --> 17:23.000
if a bad guy took your stuff?"

17:23.083 --> 17:25.002
[crowd chuckles]

17:25.085 --> 17:27.379
"Would ask him to give it back.
I don't know."

17:27.921 --> 17:29.798
He goes, "I would get a sword."

17:29.882 --> 17:31.675
[laughter]

17:31.759 --> 17:33.635
"I would cut him into pieces."

17:33.719 --> 17:34.928
[laughter continues]

17:35.012 --> 17:37.681
"And I'd put the pieces in the mailbox."
I'm like…

17:37.765 --> 17:39.808
[laughter]

17:39.892 --> 17:42.561
"What are you doing with the mailbox,
Dahmer?"

17:42.644 --> 17:44.438
[laughter]

17:45.731 --> 17:49.193
He goes, "You know Grandpa
liked a full bush?" I go, "Hey…"

17:49.276 --> 17:50.903
[uproarious laughter]

17:51.487 --> 17:53.405
"Did he call you? How do you know?"

17:53.489 --> 17:55.991
-[audience member whistles]
-[cheering]

17:57.951 --> 17:59.536
[man shouts indistinctly]

18:01.747 --> 18:03.707
My kids call me Tom.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.334
[laughter]

18:05.417 --> 18:07.002
So unnerving.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.964
Every day, the older one's like…
[gravelly] "How you doing, Tom?"

18:11.715 --> 18:14.968
I go, "Hey, I'm not your
fuckin' stepdad, all right?"

18:15.052 --> 18:17.721
-[laughter]
-[scattered cheering]

18:18.639 --> 18:21.558
"I wish I was. It'd be a lot easier.
But I'm not."

18:21.642 --> 18:23.644
-[cheering]
-[scattered applause]

18:23.727 --> 18:26.021
I go, "Call me Dad."
He goes, "I like Tom."

18:26.105 --> 18:27.356
I'm like, "All right."

18:28.023 --> 18:31.485
"What is up with your voice? You smoke
cigarettes? Why do you talk like that?"

18:32.611 --> 18:35.572
The kid sounds like
he fixes Harleys all day, but…

18:35.656 --> 18:36.990
[laughter]

18:37.074 --> 18:42.329
…he's really just obsessed with the
decades-old video game, Pac-Man.

18:42.412 --> 18:45.582
And he has Pac-Man questions

18:45.666 --> 18:48.544
morning, noon, and night.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.713
He woke me up at three in the morning.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.092
Let's be clear. He doesn't know
how to wake somebody up. All right?

18:55.175 --> 18:57.678
He stood an inch from my face…

18:57.761 --> 18:59.763
[laughter]

19:00.556 --> 19:03.600
The most menacing way
somebody can wake you up.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.228
He just goes, "Hey, Tom!"

19:06.311 --> 19:09.231
I was like, "Holy shit!"

19:09.314 --> 19:10.691
[laughter]

19:11.775 --> 19:12.734
"What?!"

19:12.818 --> 19:14.736
[laughter continues]

19:14.820 --> 19:16.613
He's like, "What would happen…

19:17.823 --> 19:19.741
if Pac-Man needed a house?"

19:19.825 --> 19:22.119
I'm like, "What the… What?!"

19:22.202 --> 19:24.121
[laughter]

19:24.955 --> 19:28.250
He thinks I didn't understand
the question.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.334
[laughter]

19:29.418 --> 19:31.503
So he slows it down. For me.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.005
[laughter]

19:33.088 --> 19:36.425
He goes… [enunciated dramatically]
"What would hap-pen…

19:37.259 --> 19:38.093
if…"

19:38.177 --> 19:42.014
I go, "He'd call a realtor."
I'm having a heart attack, all right?

19:42.097 --> 19:43.891
[laughter]

19:43.974 --> 19:46.476
"Pac-Man would get a loan
and buy a house."

19:47.060 --> 19:48.854
He's like, "Okay, I'm going to bed."

19:48.937 --> 19:51.773
I'm like, "All right.
I'll be up for three days. Thanks."

19:51.857 --> 19:53.483
[laughter]

19:55.068 --> 19:56.278
[man whoops]

19:56.361 --> 19:57.404
At the same time,

19:57.487 --> 19:59.781
I have a monitor on the nightstand

19:59.865 --> 20:00.991
for the little guy.

20:01.074 --> 20:03.118
This dude stands up in bed

20:03.869 --> 20:05.579
and he goes, "What was that?"

20:05.662 --> 20:07.539
[laughter]

20:11.418 --> 20:13.629
So now I drag my ass into his room.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.674
He's standing there with his gut out.
You know they're like…

20:17.758 --> 20:20.886
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

20:24.389 --> 20:27.684
I'm like, "Do you own a Chevron?
Why do you stand like that, dude?"

20:27.768 --> 20:29.519
[laughter]

20:31.730 --> 20:34.358
I go, "What?" He goes, "What was that?"

20:35.651 --> 20:37.236
I go, "What was what?"

20:37.319 --> 20:38.528
He goes, "That."

20:39.655 --> 20:40.989
I go, "What's that?"

20:41.073 --> 20:44.034
He goes, "What was that?"
"I don't know what you're asking."

20:44.117 --> 20:45.786
[laughter]

20:46.870 --> 20:48.872
He goes, "Was that the choo-choo?"

20:50.123 --> 20:51.416
I said, "What?"

20:51.500 --> 20:54.920
He goes… [exasperatedly]
"Was it a choo-choo?"

20:55.003 --> 20:56.213
[crowd chuckling]

20:56.296 --> 20:59.675
-He said it like, "Are you stupid enough…"
-[laughter]

21:00.467 --> 21:02.302
"…to turn our trains on

21:02.386 --> 21:04.263
without the conductor

21:05.389 --> 21:06.974
at the helm?" I go, "No."

21:07.057 --> 21:09.977
He goes, "So, what was it?"
I go, "I don't know."

21:10.978 --> 21:14.439
I said, "Maybe it was a choo-choo."
He goes, "Yeah. Don't do that."

21:14.523 --> 21:16.942
-I was like, "Oh."
-[laughter]

21:17.025 --> 21:19.861
"All right, al-Qaeda boss,
go back in your cave."

21:20.779 --> 21:23.323
[laughter fades to soft murmuring]

21:24.741 --> 21:27.077
He's one of those kids
that only laughs at real anger.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.497
I don't know if you've ever met
one of those peaches, but…

21:31.206 --> 21:35.294
See, most two and three-year-olds,
they laugh at manufactured anger.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.714
Performative anger. You can go up
to a kid that age and just go,

21:38.797 --> 21:41.383
"Rarrr. And they're like…"
[giggles joyfully]

21:42.384 --> 21:44.219
And this kid's like, "Mm-mmm."

21:44.970 --> 21:47.222
"I wanna see
your blood pressure spike, man."

21:47.306 --> 21:48.640
[laughter]

21:49.349 --> 21:52.227
The hardest I've ever seen him laugh,
it's not even close,

21:52.311 --> 21:55.272
is when he flushed my car keys
down the toilet.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.940
[audience exclaims]

21:57.024 --> 21:58.734
It was my fault, I guess.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.153
I didn't hang them up.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.656
I put them on the coffee table
that I also bought. And…

22:04.740 --> 22:07.200
[laughter]

22:07.284 --> 22:10.078
I was laying on the couch.
You know, it was a long day.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.455
I see his little ass

22:11.538 --> 22:12.914
come in the room,

22:12.998 --> 22:14.499
see the keys,

22:14.583 --> 22:16.084
and he's like…

22:16.168 --> 22:17.961
[laughter]

22:18.045 --> 22:20.297
And I go, "No. Don't."

22:20.380 --> 22:23.008
And he picks them up and he goes,
"Chase me."

22:23.091 --> 22:24.968
[laughter]

22:26.303 --> 22:27.346
"Down the hall."

22:27.429 --> 22:29.348
[laughter]

22:29.431 --> 22:30.515
I go, "Okay."

22:30.599 --> 22:32.851
I give him a head start. He's three.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.269
[laughter continues]

22:34.352 --> 22:35.771
When I stand up,

22:35.854 --> 22:38.273
I see him dip into the bathroom.
I'm like…

22:38.356 --> 22:39.399
"No."

22:39.483 --> 22:41.443
[laughter]

22:41.526 --> 22:42.986
And when I get there…

22:43.070 --> 22:44.696
[imitates toilet flushing]

22:44.780 --> 22:48.075
And I lose my shit.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.868
[laughter]

22:49.951 --> 22:53.538
I don't yell at him.
I'm just yelling at my life.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.082
-You know?
-[laughter]

22:55.165 --> 22:56.792
I'm like, "Fuck!"

22:56.875 --> 22:58.168
[laughter continues]

22:58.251 --> 22:59.336
"No!"

23:00.879 --> 23:01.922
"Fuck!"

23:02.839 --> 23:06.301
And when I turn, he's like,
"That's what I'm talking about."

23:06.384 --> 23:08.929
[loud cheering, applause]

23:12.599 --> 23:14.059
[audience member whistles]

23:16.770 --> 23:19.231
-"You're a very funny guy."
-[laughter]

23:19.314 --> 23:21.316
Fuckin' kicked him in the chest.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.777
-[laughter]
-[chuckles softly]

23:25.070 --> 23:26.530
God, those little shits.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.699
I took a shower

23:29.783 --> 23:31.243
with the, uh, six-year-old.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.911
He's six, he's not 16.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.788
-Um…
-[laughter]

23:35.914 --> 23:37.791
If you've never showered
with a six-year-old,

23:37.874 --> 23:40.752
let me give you some advice:
make sure it's yours.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.547
-Otherwise…
-[laughter]

23:45.132 --> 23:47.467
It's strange if you're like,
"What's your name?"

23:47.551 --> 23:49.845
[laughter]

23:49.928 --> 23:51.638
He's my son.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.517
And I wanted to, you know…
I was trying to be like a fun dad.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.269
I… I offered him the showerhead.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.312
I thought it was a fun,
in-the-moment thing.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.857
I go, "Do you wanna hold the showerhead?"

24:01.940 --> 24:03.316
And he was like, "Yeah."

24:03.400 --> 24:04.651
[laughter]

24:04.734 --> 24:07.904
I give it to him. He just starts
cleaning the shower. He's like…

24:07.988 --> 24:10.240
[laughter]

24:13.243 --> 24:15.954
So, you know, after a minute, I'm like,

24:16.037 --> 24:17.455
"Can you wet me?"

24:17.539 --> 24:18.623
[laughter]

24:20.709 --> 24:23.795
And he goes, "Tom, relax. All right?"

24:23.879 --> 24:27.507
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause, cheering]

24:29.676 --> 24:31.595
Then he looks up at me.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.805
He goes… [gravelly]
"You have a big penis."

24:33.889 --> 24:35.640
[laughter]

24:35.724 --> 24:37.225
"And I have a small one."

24:37.309 --> 24:38.810
[laughter]

24:38.894 --> 24:41.313
I go, "Well, that's 'cause
mine's hard, buddy."

24:41.396 --> 24:44.149
[uproarious laughter]

24:44.232 --> 24:46.985
[cheers and applause]

24:49.905 --> 24:52.365
"We can make yours hard too.
Just gotta go like…"

24:52.449 --> 24:55.702
[audience exclaims, laughs]

24:55.785 --> 24:58.955
[hushed murmurs, chatter]

25:01.082 --> 25:04.002
-[disappointedly] "No."
-[laughter]

25:05.545 --> 25:08.673
[laughingly] I did not jerk off my son.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.425
[laughter]

25:11.468 --> 25:13.887
I just always wanted to say that. Uh…

25:13.970 --> 25:15.847
[laughter]

25:16.556 --> 25:17.682
[sputters, laughs]

25:17.766 --> 25:19.392
[laughter]

25:21.937 --> 25:23.521
The truth is…

25:24.814 --> 25:26.816
The truth is, he really did say,

25:26.900 --> 25:30.862
"You have a big penis.
And I have a small one."

25:30.946 --> 25:32.614
And what I really said,

25:32.697 --> 25:33.823
immediately,

25:33.907 --> 25:37.035
and I mean in a split second

25:37.118 --> 25:38.495
of him saying that,

25:38.578 --> 25:40.455
I went… [gutturally] "No!"

25:40.538 --> 25:42.249
[laughter]

25:46.962 --> 25:49.547
And if you're like,
"Why did you shout, 'No'?"

25:50.090 --> 25:52.384
I think because in that split second

25:52.467 --> 25:55.345
I thought, "I don't want this
to be some shit

25:55.428 --> 25:57.973
you start saying when we're out."

25:58.056 --> 25:59.849
[laughter]

26:00.850 --> 26:03.019
I don't wanna be in a store
where he's like,

26:03.103 --> 26:05.522
"Do you have a big penis?"
I'll be like… "Yeah."

26:05.605 --> 26:07.691
[laughter]

26:07.774 --> 26:10.068
"You know how it is."
Guy's like, "I don't know how it is."

26:10.151 --> 26:12.237
"What the fuck was that all about?"

26:12.988 --> 26:15.240
[crowd chuckling]

26:15.323 --> 26:16.866
The worst part

26:16.950 --> 26:18.326
is that I scared him.

26:18.410 --> 26:23.707
When I shouted. That's a terrible feeling.
You see fear register on your kid's face

26:23.790 --> 26:27.585
because of your overreaction.
And I wanted to say the right thing.

26:27.669 --> 26:32.007
Or whatever the right thing is to say
in that situation.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.342
Which I suppose
would've been something like,

26:34.426 --> 26:37.846
"You didn't do anything wrong.
You made an observation."

26:37.929 --> 26:41.308
"I shouldn't have shouted.
I'm sorry. Do you need therapy?"

26:41.391 --> 26:43.810
-"I love you, man." You know…
-[laughter]

26:43.893 --> 26:47.522
But it was all happening so quickly
that I didn't know what to say.

26:47.605 --> 26:50.191
So the fuckin' best I could come up with?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.609
I went, "No!"

26:51.693 --> 26:53.528
"Just… shh."

26:53.611 --> 26:55.989
[laughter]

26:59.367 --> 27:01.077
Now he's totally confused.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.537
[crowd chuckling]

27:02.620 --> 27:04.789
He goes… [whispers]
"You have a big penis."

27:04.873 --> 27:07.000
[laughter]

27:09.002 --> 27:10.420
"I have a small one."

27:10.503 --> 27:11.963
[laughter continues]

27:12.047 --> 27:14.466
I go, "Well, don't fuckin' tell anybody."

27:15.967 --> 27:18.428
He goes, "Did Grandpa have a big penis?"

27:19.137 --> 27:21.890
I go, "I don't remember.
Haven't seen it in a long time."

27:21.973 --> 27:23.475
[laughter]

27:23.558 --> 27:24.934
"Let's go ask Grandma."

27:25.018 --> 27:26.978
[laughter continues]

27:27.062 --> 27:28.063
And we did.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.773
[scattered cheers]

27:29.856 --> 27:30.774
And he didn't.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.942
[laughter]

27:33.026 --> 27:34.944
[scattered applause]

27:36.196 --> 27:39.032
[loud cheering]

27:43.036 --> 27:45.121
[audience member whistles]

27:45.205 --> 27:46.206
For the record,

27:46.915 --> 27:48.958
-neither do I.
-[laughter]

27:49.042 --> 27:52.170
I wanna make that perfectly clear
to everybody here.

27:52.253 --> 27:56.216
I do not have a big penis.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.634
But…

27:57.717 --> 27:59.219
next to a six-year-old…

27:59.302 --> 28:01.471
[laughter]

28:01.554 --> 28:04.099
…I got a fuckin' sledgehammer on me.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.392
Pretty proud of it.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.560
-[cheering]
-[whistling]

28:09.145 --> 28:10.522
[snorts, splutters]

28:11.231 --> 28:12.440
[two thudding slaps]

28:13.149 --> 28:14.067
[chokes]

28:15.026 --> 28:17.404
You almost broke the fuckin' stage, dude.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.280
[laughter]

28:19.364 --> 28:20.198
[sighs]

28:20.281 --> 28:22.158
The truth is this. I'm just, uh…

28:22.242 --> 28:23.451
I'm happy

28:23.535 --> 28:26.579
to be doing stand-up again
and actually standing.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.206
Because not long ago,

28:28.289 --> 28:31.835
I had a sports-related injury.
I don't know if you know this or not. Um…

28:31.918 --> 28:34.170
[crowd cheering]

28:35.922 --> 28:36.965
Well…

28:37.841 --> 28:42.429
If you don't know, I will try to say this
with a straight face. Uh…

28:42.512 --> 28:44.514
I, Tom,

28:44.597 --> 28:46.683
the guy you see standing up here,

28:46.766 --> 28:48.893
I was severely injured

28:49.769 --> 28:52.105
whilst participating

28:52.188 --> 28:54.441
in a slam-dunk contest.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.234
[scattered cheers and applause]

28:56.317 --> 28:57.944
-[loud cheering]
-Um…

29:01.823 --> 29:06.035
On a slightly-lowered rim. Now…

29:06.119 --> 29:08.955
It was wild. If you don't know, I tore

29:09.038 --> 29:11.916
my patellar tendon… [exhales swiftly]
…right there.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.294
Which, you know, whatever.
[chuckles]

29:14.377 --> 29:15.503
[laughter]

29:15.587 --> 29:17.756
Happened to Klay Thompson,
happened to me.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.591
It happens to us. But…

29:19.674 --> 29:22.218
[laughter]

29:22.302 --> 29:26.014
I'm not Klay Thompson,
so I also broke this arm. And…

29:26.931 --> 29:30.059
It's all captured on video
that I find very not funny,

29:30.143 --> 29:31.978
but a lot of people enjoy it.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.188
[scattered applause]

29:33.772 --> 29:36.524
I have to tell people,
"I didn't laugh a lot that night."

29:36.608 --> 29:38.401
And they're like, "Really?" Yeah.

29:38.485 --> 29:42.030
There is one exchange
that I do like to share, and it is this.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.867
Immediately after I was hurt,
I was in the emergency room.

29:45.950 --> 29:50.121
And I was badly hurt. I had a shattered
arm, a leg that didn't function.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.665
And they were prepping me
for the operating room.

29:52.749 --> 29:56.044
And at that time, a trauma surgeon

29:56.127 --> 29:57.420
came into that room

29:57.504 --> 29:59.255
and he looked at my x-rays

29:59.339 --> 30:01.090
and he goes, "Car accident?"

30:01.174 --> 30:04.135
[laughter]

30:04.219 --> 30:07.639
And I got to lay there and go…
[quietly] "Dunk contest."

30:07.722 --> 30:09.849
[laughter]

30:09.933 --> 30:12.727
[cheers and applause]

30:15.230 --> 30:17.941
And he goes, "What was that?
What did you just say?"

30:18.775 --> 30:22.320
And I go, "Slam motherfuckin'
dunk contest."

30:22.403 --> 30:23.738
[laughter]

30:23.822 --> 30:26.449
He goes, "Did a car hit you
while you were dunking?"

30:26.533 --> 30:28.493
[laughter]

30:28.576 --> 30:31.287
I said, "Why don't you do
your fuckin' job, all right?"

30:32.121 --> 30:36.251
Some people don't know this,
I was in the hospital for three weeks.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.836
That's a long time.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.671
I don't think I would've
made it through

30:39.754 --> 30:42.632
if it weren't for my dear, dear friend,

30:42.715 --> 30:44.884
-Dilaudid. Um…
-[laughter]

30:44.968 --> 30:46.052
[scattered cheers]

30:46.135 --> 30:48.847
Yeah. I did not realize

30:48.930 --> 30:52.267
that I have been fucking around

30:53.476 --> 30:55.144
with weed all these years…

30:55.228 --> 30:57.105
[scattered cheering]

30:57.188 --> 31:00.733
…when narcotics is where it's at.
All right?

31:00.817 --> 31:02.861
-[cheering]
-[scattered applause]

31:02.944 --> 31:04.237
That shit

31:04.320 --> 31:05.864
is electric. And…

31:06.406 --> 31:09.659
if anybody ever offers you an oxy,
say, "Hit me two times."

31:09.742 --> 31:13.830
Because… they're amazing
and nothing bad'll happen to you.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.915
[laughter]

31:15.999 --> 31:19.460
Nah, your life will fall apart,
but it'll feel good while it's happening.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.422
The only downside really

31:22.505 --> 31:25.800
is that you'll never shit… again.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.343
-Uh…
-[laughter]

31:27.427 --> 31:32.015
I took my first shit eight days
after I started eating those.

31:32.098 --> 31:33.308
I was scared.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.517
I called in the doctor.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.896
I was like, "I have an arm that
doesn't work, a leg that doesn't work."

31:37.979 --> 31:40.690
"How do I lean? How do I wipe myself?"

31:40.773 --> 31:42.525
He goes, "Don't worry about it."

31:43.151 --> 31:46.321
"One of the nurses will do it."
And I was like, "Okay."

31:46.404 --> 31:47.864
[laughter]

31:47.947 --> 31:51.159
And then a fuckin' male nurse
came in the room.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.869
[laughter]

31:52.952 --> 31:56.372
They're allowed to have the job too.
And…

31:56.456 --> 31:59.667
[crowd chuckling]

31:59.751 --> 32:02.670
This dude stood at the door

32:02.754 --> 32:04.672
and threw a pack of wipes.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.966
[laughter]

32:08.551 --> 32:09.802
I go, "What's that?"

32:10.470 --> 32:13.264
He said, "The doctor said
you need to clean yourself."

32:13.348 --> 32:15.099
And I went… [chuckles devilishly]

32:16.684 --> 32:19.354
[uproarious laughter]

32:19.437 --> 32:20.730
"You're gonna do it."

32:22.190 --> 32:24.859
And I saw a grown professional nurse

32:24.943 --> 32:27.612
-just go, "Ah, fuck." Like…
-[laughter]

32:27.695 --> 32:30.615
He quit. I saw him quit his job.
Isn't that crazy? Now…

32:31.366 --> 32:32.951
Five days later,

32:33.034 --> 32:35.036
I had my second movement,

32:35.119 --> 32:38.373
and they sent in an old-lady nurse,
which is fine.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.416
But she talked the whole time.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.544
Do you know how terrible…?
You're vulnerable. Like… [whimpers]

32:44.796 --> 32:48.383
She's back there, like,
"How we gonna clean up all this stool?"

32:48.466 --> 32:51.636
-I'm like, "I don't know. Shut up."
-[laughter]

32:54.889 --> 32:57.225
And she goes, "My, my, my."

32:58.101 --> 33:01.187
"You have so much hair back here."
And I'm like…

33:02.313 --> 33:04.440
"Yeah, I do it for my dad."

33:04.524 --> 33:07.026
-You know, like…
-[laughter]

33:07.110 --> 33:09.153
[cheers and applause]

33:09.237 --> 33:10.071
What?

33:10.780 --> 33:11.698
I mean…

33:15.743 --> 33:18.246
I like to picture him up in heaven,
looking down.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.581
"Look at that hair on my son.
Isn't that nice?"

33:22.166 --> 33:24.127
God's with him. "That is nice."

33:24.210 --> 33:25.461
[laughter]

33:25.545 --> 33:28.172
I picture my dad naked. You know?

33:28.256 --> 33:29.215
[laughs] I…

33:29.298 --> 33:31.384
[laughter]

33:31.467 --> 33:34.012
I picture everybody in heaven nak…

33:34.095 --> 33:37.056
I don't think you're in heaven,
"What shirt should I wear today?"

33:37.140 --> 33:39.851
I think people are naked.
I think God's naked.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.436
I think after a while it makes sense

33:41.519 --> 33:46.065
that my father would notice that God
has a fuckin' piece on him.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.400
You know?

33:47.483 --> 33:51.237
It's God. I think it's enormous.
And glorious. I think it's blue.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.031
-And I think…
-[laughter]

33:53.114 --> 33:55.616
…it has a golden hue around it.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.037
I think after a while, my dad would go,

33:59.120 --> 34:00.455
"Can I touch that?"

34:00.538 --> 34:02.206
[laughter]

34:02.290 --> 34:04.000
And God's like, "Of course."

34:05.001 --> 34:07.003
"You are one of my children." [chuckles]

34:07.086 --> 34:08.755
[laughter]

34:11.299 --> 34:13.051
[laughter swells]

34:15.636 --> 34:17.889
Then he goes, "Thanks. That was neat."

34:17.972 --> 34:19.265
[laughter]

34:19.348 --> 34:21.726
And then God says,
"Do you want to see it snow?"

34:21.809 --> 34:23.352
[imitates sexual moaning]

34:23.436 --> 34:24.687
[laughter]

34:24.771 --> 34:26.939
That's what snow is. You didn't know that?

34:28.149 --> 34:29.067
Snowing.

34:30.026 --> 34:32.320
Good. I hope I ruined snow for you.
Now…

34:32.403 --> 34:34.072
[laughter]

34:34.822 --> 34:37.700
It took me six months

34:37.784 --> 34:39.368
of pretty intense rehab,

34:39.452 --> 34:40.912
PT and OT.

34:40.995 --> 34:43.664
Shout-out to all the PTs
and OTs in the world

34:43.748 --> 34:45.208
working with people.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.126
-Fantastic.
-[applause]

34:47.210 --> 34:48.711
Well, they worked with me

34:48.795 --> 34:51.798
so that I could move around again
normally and naturally.

34:51.881 --> 34:55.843
And then this always gets me, you guys.
Seven months to the day,

34:55.927 --> 34:57.220
to the day,

34:57.303 --> 34:58.596
after I was injured,

34:58.679 --> 35:00.181
I was at home.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.599
I was asleep.

35:01.682 --> 35:04.102
It was two o'clock in the morning.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.104
And I heard my wife scream,

35:06.187 --> 35:09.107
but, like, a real scream. You know, like…

35:09.190 --> 35:11.109
[muted panicked screaming]

35:11.192 --> 35:12.693
So I took a pillow,

35:12.777 --> 35:14.112
I turned,

35:14.195 --> 35:15.988
and I covered this ear. Right?

35:16.072 --> 35:17.406
[laughter]

35:17.490 --> 35:20.034
"I am trying to sleep."

35:21.536 --> 35:24.288
And then she starts
calling me out by name.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.832
She's like, "Tom?"

35:26.999 --> 35:29.043
"Tom?"

35:29.127 --> 35:32.296
And I go, "Goddammit."

35:32.380 --> 35:34.674
[laughter]

35:34.757 --> 35:36.050
"This sounds real."

35:36.926 --> 35:40.721
So I got up,
I made myself something to eat.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.974
[laughter]

35:46.102 --> 35:47.395
Poured a drink.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.148
And I was like, "All right."

35:51.023 --> 35:52.233
"Let's go find her."

35:52.316 --> 35:54.026
[laughter]

35:54.110 --> 35:55.319
Now, it's 2:00 a.m.

35:55.403 --> 35:58.906
I… I can't see anything.
I'm just following her cries for help.

35:59.532 --> 36:03.619
And I finally find her
sitting at the bottom of the stairs.

36:03.703 --> 36:09.375
And I go, "What are you doing?"
She goes, "I think I sprained my ankle."

36:09.458 --> 36:11.002
[laughter]

36:11.085 --> 36:12.587
I turn the light on,

36:12.670 --> 36:13.796
and I see

36:13.880 --> 36:15.673
that the bone

36:15.756 --> 36:17.842
that should be like this…

36:18.593 --> 36:21.053
-[clicks tongue] …is like that.
-[audience groans]

36:21.721 --> 36:24.473
And I go, "That… [laughingly]
…is not a sprain."

36:24.557 --> 36:26.809
[laughter]

36:26.893 --> 36:27.935
"I'm sure of it."

36:28.019 --> 36:29.562
[laughter]

36:29.645 --> 36:31.898
And she goes, "What should I do?"

36:33.024 --> 36:35.109
I said, "You should do nothing."

36:36.152 --> 36:37.695
"I will call 911."

36:37.778 --> 36:38.946
[laughter]

36:39.030 --> 36:40.573
I have to confess

36:40.656 --> 36:43.910
I was very, very excited

36:45.161 --> 36:46.204
to call 911.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.039
[laughter]

36:48.122 --> 36:51.417
Have you ever been excited to call?
Like, "Finally, a good one."

36:51.500 --> 36:54.879
You know? Like…
"This is why we play the game."

36:54.962 --> 36:56.047
I call.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.342
The operator goes, "911."

36:59.425 --> 37:01.385
And I'm so amped up,

37:01.469 --> 37:04.513
I go, "Get fuckin' ready."

37:04.597 --> 37:07.016
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

37:10.102 --> 37:11.395
He's like, "Okay."

37:11.479 --> 37:12.813
[laughter continues]

37:12.897 --> 37:16.275
He goes, "You need police,
fire, or paramedic?"

37:16.359 --> 37:17.818
I go, "Paramedic!"

37:18.569 --> 37:21.697
"But send 'em all!" And he was like,
"What happened?"

37:21.781 --> 37:23.366
And I was like, "Ooh."

37:23.449 --> 37:24.825
[laughter]

37:24.909 --> 37:26.410
And I realize

37:26.494 --> 37:29.956
that while what I'm about to say is true,

37:30.039 --> 37:31.457
it sounds…

37:31.540 --> 37:34.543
-[high-pitched] …suspicious.
-[laughter]

37:36.671 --> 37:39.257
But I gotta say it. So I'm like,

37:39.340 --> 37:41.217
"My wife fell down the stairs."

37:41.300 --> 37:43.928
[loud laughter]

37:44.011 --> 37:45.930
[cheers and applause]

37:49.934 --> 37:51.310
[cheers fading]

37:51.394 --> 37:53.437
The operator goes, "Uh-huh."

37:53.521 --> 37:55.398
[laughter]

37:55.481 --> 37:58.693
He goes, "How'd that happen?"
I was like, "I don't fuckin' know."

37:58.776 --> 38:01.028
[laughter]

38:01.112 --> 38:04.865
He goes, "Was she alone?"
I'm like, "Do I need to talk to a lawyer?"

38:04.949 --> 38:07.243
[laughter]

38:07.326 --> 38:09.495
Four paramedics show up.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.247
I open the door.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.791
They go, "What happened?"
I go, "You know the deal."

38:13.874 --> 38:15.001
[laughter]

38:15.084 --> 38:17.169
"My wife fell down the stairs."

38:18.254 --> 38:19.922
And they go, "How'd it happen?"

38:20.006 --> 38:22.800
I go, "I do not know."

38:23.718 --> 38:25.177
They're like, "Was she alone?"

38:25.261 --> 38:28.180
I go, "Talk to my lawyer.
He's on the phone right now."

38:28.264 --> 38:30.016
[crowd chuckling]

38:30.099 --> 38:31.892
Then they start tending to her.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.396
Like, they put her leg in a brace.
You know? Start giving her an IV.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.440
I lean over to her

38:37.523 --> 38:39.608
and I have a private conversation

38:39.692 --> 38:41.110
as you sometimes do.

38:41.193 --> 38:43.779
I go, "Hey, I wanna tell you something."

38:43.863 --> 38:46.282
"I don't like the way
I'm being spoken to here."

38:46.365 --> 38:48.951
[laughter]

38:50.036 --> 38:53.914
"I feel like everybody's implying
I had something to do with this."

38:54.457 --> 38:56.459
"And I don't like it."

38:58.085 --> 38:59.795
And then I walked away.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.672
And a few moments later,

39:01.756 --> 39:04.925
she decided to make an announcement.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.177
[crowd chuckles]

39:06.260 --> 39:07.720
Unprompted.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.182
She goes, "Guys?"

39:11.807 --> 39:13.517
And they all turn.

39:13.601 --> 39:16.270
And she goes, "He would never hurt me."

39:16.354 --> 39:18.564
-And I'm like…
-[uproarious laughter]

39:18.647 --> 39:19.815
[scattered applause]

39:19.899 --> 39:21.275
"What are you doing?"

39:21.359 --> 39:22.818
[scattered cheers]

39:25.446 --> 39:28.240
She goes, "We've been together
a long time."

39:28.324 --> 39:30.076
"And if you think he did this,

39:30.159 --> 39:31.744
he didn't."

39:31.827 --> 39:33.412
I go, "Shut the fuck up."

39:33.496 --> 39:35.289
[laughter]

39:35.373 --> 39:36.874
"Or I will kill you."

39:36.957 --> 39:39.752
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

39:41.796 --> 39:44.757
Then we get to the hospital.
Doctor's like, "What happened?"

39:44.840 --> 39:47.718
I go, "I punched her in the mouth
and she fell down the stairs."

39:47.802 --> 39:48.803
[laughter]

39:48.886 --> 39:52.223
-And he goes, "I get it, man. I get it."
-[laughter]

39:52.306 --> 39:54.475
"She's super chatty." I go, "I know."

39:54.558 --> 39:55.643
[laughter continues]

39:56.310 --> 39:57.853
"You should see her at home."

39:58.562 --> 40:01.732
No, she's doing better now.
She learned. She gets it, you know.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.610
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

40:04.693 --> 40:06.570
"Sandwich at 6:00." All right.

40:06.654 --> 40:07.696
So…

40:07.780 --> 40:09.990
-[laughs softly]
-[crowd chuckling]

40:11.742 --> 40:14.161
She came to a show
and saw me tell that story,

40:14.245 --> 40:16.872
and she was like, "Can you imagine
if you had hit me?"

40:16.956 --> 40:18.040
And I was like,

40:18.124 --> 40:19.458
"Uh… yeah."

40:19.542 --> 40:21.460
[laughter]

40:24.046 --> 40:25.756
Don't feel bad for her, okay?

40:26.298 --> 40:28.759
I'm serious. I just did her a huge solid.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.011
She asked me to do this and I did it.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.681
She asked me
to get a vasectomy and I did it.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.434
-So I got snipped. Yeah.
-[women cheering]

40:37.059 --> 40:38.018
See?

40:39.478 --> 40:43.566
The women always cheer
and there's always one guy that boos.

40:43.649 --> 40:44.608
[laughter]

40:44.692 --> 40:47.945
Like he wanted my full load
all up inside of him.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.448
[laughter]

40:52.324 --> 40:55.744
Listen, if you're a guy
and you're thinking about doing it,

40:55.828 --> 40:57.746
do it. It's a routine procedure.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.541
You will be nervous the morning of.

41:00.624 --> 41:01.792
It's your balls.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.795
-[crowd chuckling]
-You lay on a table. It's very cold.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.466
-It's, like, 400 below zero. And…
-[laughter]

41:08.549 --> 41:13.471
They pull up your dress very dramatically.
They're like, "What's going on down here?"

41:13.554 --> 41:14.680
[laughter]

41:14.763 --> 41:18.142
Your dick just stares at you, like,
"How could you?" You know?

41:18.225 --> 41:19.977
[laughter]

41:20.978 --> 41:24.273
But it's over in 15 minutes,
which I think is remarkable.

41:24.356 --> 41:27.109
And then you go back a week later
for the follow-up.

41:27.193 --> 41:30.321
And the follow-up is just a urologist
checking you out.

41:30.404 --> 41:32.907
Goes, "All right, drop your shorts."
Like, "All right…"

41:32.990 --> 41:35.826
[inquisitive humming]

41:35.910 --> 41:37.495
[laughter]

41:37.578 --> 41:39.788
-[moaning softly]
-[laughter]

41:41.874 --> 41:44.168
He goes, "Yeah, it tastes the same."
You know?

41:44.251 --> 41:46.086
[laughter]

41:46.170 --> 41:48.631
[audience murmuring, chuckling]

41:50.549 --> 41:53.761
He says, "I'm gonna give you your
homework." Those are his words.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.222
"I'm gonna give you your homework."
I go, "What's my homework?"

41:56.305 --> 42:00.142
He goes, "Go home, ejaculate 20 times."

42:00.226 --> 42:04.522
"Bring in your 21st sample in this cup,
and we'll test it and let you know

42:04.605 --> 42:07.525
if you're clear."
I was like, "That ain't shit." You know?

42:07.608 --> 42:09.944
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

42:12.404 --> 42:14.698
I do my homework all the time, baby.
So…

42:14.782 --> 42:17.576
-[laughter]
-[cheering]

42:17.660 --> 42:19.203
He goes to leave,

42:19.286 --> 42:21.247
but he stops at the door.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.707
He goes, "Oh!
I almost forgot to tell you."

42:23.791 --> 42:25.042
"Take your time."

42:25.125 --> 42:26.961
And I said, "I was gonna."

42:27.044 --> 42:28.212
[laughter]

42:28.295 --> 42:29.421
And then he says,

42:29.505 --> 42:33.551
"Sometimes I forget to tell people."

42:33.634 --> 42:34.885
Which tells me

42:34.969 --> 42:38.472
that some people have returned
rather quickly.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.473
[laughter]

42:39.557 --> 42:42.268
With their assignment.
So I immediately ask him. I go,

42:42.351 --> 42:44.770
"What's the fastest anyone's
done 20 ejaculations?"

42:44.853 --> 42:46.313
[laughter]

42:46.397 --> 42:47.856
He goes, "48 hours."

42:47.940 --> 42:49.858
-And I was like…
-[audience groans]

42:49.942 --> 42:54.071
"That motherfucker can keep that record.
I don't want anything to do with that."

42:54.154 --> 42:55.364
[laughter]

42:56.073 --> 42:59.243
-"That's the champ champ right there."
-[laughter]

42:59.910 --> 43:02.705
I went home and took another week off.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.541
I was black and blue. I was sore.
Like, "All right."

43:05.624 --> 43:08.085
But after the week,
it's time to get going.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.588
I started slowly, you know. I was like…

43:11.130 --> 43:13.841
[laughter]

43:13.924 --> 43:14.967
"Wake up."

43:16.302 --> 43:18.012
Didn't feel the same.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.346
It was strange.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.639
Different. You know?

43:20.723 --> 43:23.017
I could feel the system turning on.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.643
You know what it reminded me of?

43:24.727 --> 43:28.480
You know when you run the heat
for the first time in the winter?

43:29.565 --> 43:32.026
And you're like, "This smells weird, man."
Like…

43:32.109 --> 43:34.194
[laughter]

43:35.946 --> 43:37.781
I could feel it building up.

43:38.699 --> 43:43.621
And I could not get
this one intrusive thought

43:43.704 --> 43:45.289
out of my head,

43:45.372 --> 43:49.043
which was, "It's just gonna be blood
that comes out."

43:49.126 --> 43:50.794
[audience groans]

43:50.878 --> 43:53.005
-I didn't want it to be.
-[laughter]

43:53.088 --> 43:54.506
I just kept thinking it.

43:54.590 --> 43:57.009
So now I'm jerking off all scared. Like…

43:57.551 --> 43:59.094
[exaggerated whimpering]

44:01.555 --> 44:04.099
-[sorrowfully] "It's gonna be blood!"
-[laughter]

44:06.727 --> 44:09.104
But I pushed through. I kept going. And…

44:09.188 --> 44:11.065
[laughter]

44:11.148 --> 44:12.775
…when it finally did go,

44:12.858 --> 44:14.401
it wasn't blood.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.528
And in relief, I laughed.

44:16.612 --> 44:17.738
[crowd chuckles]

44:17.821 --> 44:20.157
So my first jack back

44:20.240 --> 44:21.116
was me going…

44:21.200 --> 44:23.494
-[laughs maniacally]
-[laughter]

44:23.577 --> 44:24.912
[applause]

44:24.995 --> 44:27.623
-Yeah. Well…
-[crowd cheering]

44:28.540 --> 44:30.918
[cheers and applause continuing]

44:32.961 --> 44:35.339
Instagram took it down,
but it's on my OnlyFans

44:35.422 --> 44:37.675
-if you wanna see it.
-[laughter]

44:37.758 --> 44:39.468
Six bucks a month. Now…

44:40.678 --> 44:44.264
The only thing, uh, that could deal with
that specific type of pain

44:44.348 --> 44:47.017
when I had the vasectomy
was eating edibles.

44:47.101 --> 44:51.480
You know? I had to eat edibles
every day for that achy, weird pain.

44:51.563 --> 44:55.984
Yeah. I always feel like I have to confess
to people immediately when I tell them,

44:56.068 --> 44:58.320
like, that I like edibles,
and that is because

44:58.404 --> 45:01.824
I am a lightweight
and I like mild edibles.

45:01.907 --> 45:04.034
-Some people wanna eat edibles…
-[applause]

45:04.118 --> 45:05.452
You know, yeah. And…

45:05.536 --> 45:09.581
Some people wanna peek into the third
dimension casually every day.

45:09.665 --> 45:11.041
[cheering]

45:11.125 --> 45:12.668
That's not me. All right?

45:12.751 --> 45:15.254
I like five and ten milligrams,

45:15.337 --> 45:16.755
-and people…
-[cheering]

45:16.839 --> 45:18.424
-Sure.
-[applause]

45:18.507 --> 45:21.718
People mock me and they call me
"10 Milligram Tom"

45:21.802 --> 45:24.596
-and this bullshit.
-[laughter]

45:24.680 --> 45:28.725
Yell it to me on the street.
Like, "Are you eating your baby edibles?"

45:28.809 --> 45:31.812
And I go, "Yes. Because I like
to be able to speak."

45:31.895 --> 45:34.064
-"Is that crazy to you?"
-[scattered cheers]

45:34.148 --> 45:37.901
"You don't know people
that like a couple beers?"

45:37.985 --> 45:39.069
Is it always,

45:39.153 --> 45:42.197
"I like to drink 36."

45:42.281 --> 45:44.366
"Okay. Good for you, Bert."

45:44.450 --> 45:47.578
-"Have a great night." So…
-[raucous cheering]

45:55.169 --> 45:56.712
[cheering fades]

45:56.795 --> 45:58.755
[guffaws mockingly]

45:58.839 --> 46:00.007
[laughter]

46:00.090 --> 46:03.093
[scattered cheers and applause]

46:03.177 --> 46:05.554
[mockingly] "I'm the mechanic!"
Or whatever.

46:05.637 --> 46:07.473
[laughter]

46:07.556 --> 46:09.641
[crowd cheering]

46:09.725 --> 46:10.601
Yeah.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.978
[cheering continues]

46:15.063 --> 46:15.981
Bert.

46:17.316 --> 46:19.860
[audience member whistles]

46:19.943 --> 46:21.195
Well…

46:21.278 --> 46:23.780
"We forgot how the story goes.
Tell it again." Now…

46:23.864 --> 46:26.033
-[laughter]
-[chortles]

46:27.910 --> 46:29.578
That's my bestie.

46:29.661 --> 46:31.663
[laughter]

46:31.747 --> 46:34.500
Speaking of friends, you never…
I wanna make this clear.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.293
If you drink, if you smoke,

46:36.376 --> 46:38.420
if you inject things into your eyeballs,

46:38.504 --> 46:42.090
you never have to worry about strangers.

46:42.174 --> 46:45.802
Never push the myth that a stranger
might be culpable

46:45.886 --> 46:47.095
in getting you fucked up.

46:47.179 --> 46:50.140
People say it, like, "What if a stranger
spikes my drink?"

46:50.224 --> 46:53.268
"What if a stranger hands me a joint
and it's laced?"

46:53.352 --> 46:57.022
Guess what? It'll never be a stranger.
It'll be one of your friends. Okay?

46:57.105 --> 47:00.526
-[laughter]
-Your friends will fuck you the hardest.

47:00.609 --> 47:01.568
[laughter]

47:02.194 --> 47:03.654
I know this firsthand.

47:03.737 --> 47:05.989
I have a bunch of really cool friends.
Um…

47:06.823 --> 47:09.535
I found out on this tour
that one of my friends

47:09.618 --> 47:12.496
was in the same city as I was in
on the same night.

47:12.579 --> 47:15.415
Very rare in this line of work.
I was in Miami.

47:15.499 --> 47:18.085
I find this out.
I cancel our dinner plans.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.461
I drive across town.

47:19.545 --> 47:21.171
I walk into this club

47:21.255 --> 47:22.839
and I see my good friend.

47:22.923 --> 47:25.467
Some of you know him.
He's a comedian and podcaster.

47:25.551 --> 47:28.262
His name is Joey Diaz.

47:28.345 --> 47:30.764
-Now…
-[resounding cheers]

47:32.391 --> 47:35.310
[audience member whistles]

47:35.394 --> 47:37.646
[cheers fade]

47:37.729 --> 47:39.898
If you're here
and don't know who that is,

47:39.982 --> 47:42.317
please allow me to describe him to you.

47:42.401 --> 47:43.485
[laughter]

47:43.569 --> 47:45.737
Joey is a very funny man.

47:45.821 --> 47:47.072
He's a… He's a comedian.

47:47.155 --> 47:48.949
He's 60 years old.

47:49.032 --> 47:51.326
He's a Cuban immigrant.

47:51.410 --> 47:53.704
Uh, he weighs 295.

47:53.787 --> 47:58.375
And… he sort of looks like
if somebody was making a person

47:58.458 --> 48:01.962
and then they left him under a heat lamp
for like 15 minutes.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.673
[crowd groans, chuckling]

48:07.217 --> 48:09.636
As a side note, I feel like
I should point out

48:09.720 --> 48:13.599
he was addicted to cocaine and heroin
for 20 years.

48:14.308 --> 48:17.394
I think that's relevant to the story.
Now…

48:17.477 --> 48:18.979
[crowd chuckling]

48:19.062 --> 48:20.480
Joey's very affectionate.

48:20.564 --> 48:23.191
I get to this place
and he gives me a great big hug.

48:23.275 --> 48:26.612
And the first thing he says to me,
he goes, "I got you something."

48:26.695 --> 48:27.696
[crowd chuckles]

48:27.779 --> 48:30.240
I go, "You got me something?
What did you get me?"

48:30.324 --> 48:33.660
He goes, "I know you like your tens.
You're 10 Milli Tom."

48:33.744 --> 48:34.995
[laughter]

48:35.078 --> 48:36.413
"I got you some tens."

48:36.496 --> 48:38.332
And I go, "No, you didn't."

48:38.415 --> 48:40.000
[laughter]

48:41.501 --> 48:44.212
He goes, "I did." I go, "No, you didn't."

48:44.296 --> 48:47.424
He goes, "Why are you saying that?"
"'Cause you're a liar and a bad person."

48:47.507 --> 48:49.509
-"You're lying right now."
-[laughter]

48:50.719 --> 48:53.305
He goes, "No, I'm not."
I go, "Sure you are."

48:53.388 --> 48:54.765
And he has a jar,

48:54.848 --> 48:56.224
and he pours

48:56.308 --> 48:58.226
five gelcaps

48:58.310 --> 48:59.561
into his hand.

48:59.645 --> 49:02.856
And he goes, "These are tens."
And I go, "Bullshit."

49:02.939 --> 49:03.982
[laughter]

49:04.066 --> 49:05.067
And then he goes…

49:05.150 --> 49:07.486
-[gulps]
-[laughter]

49:07.569 --> 49:09.196
Eats all five.

49:09.279 --> 49:11.073
Like they're Skittles.

49:11.156 --> 49:12.783
[laughter]

49:12.866 --> 49:15.494
So then I go, "Huh.
Maybe they are tens."

49:17.120 --> 49:19.956
-[laughter]
-[scattered applause]

49:21.625 --> 49:23.669
I said, "I would like one."

49:23.752 --> 49:26.463
I put it on my tongue.
I take a sip of water.

49:26.546 --> 49:28.006
As it goes down,

49:28.090 --> 49:30.175
I look at him. He goes, "Oh!"

49:30.258 --> 49:32.594
[laughter]

49:37.265 --> 49:40.102
I go, "How much did I just take?"
And he goes, "Ten."

49:40.185 --> 49:43.855
-And he just walks out of the room.
-[laughter]

49:43.939 --> 49:45.273
I'm watching him perform.

49:45.357 --> 49:47.984
You know, 30 minutes in,
I have a buzz.

49:48.068 --> 49:50.028
When the show's over,

49:50.112 --> 49:52.155
I am out…

49:52.239 --> 49:55.492
of my goddamn mind.

49:55.575 --> 49:56.952
[laughter]

49:57.035 --> 49:59.913
I am vibrating like a tuning fork.

49:59.996 --> 50:03.375
I'm like… [imitates pulsing vibration]

50:03.458 --> 50:04.918
[laughter]

50:05.001 --> 50:06.878
I can't open my eyes. I'm like…

50:06.962 --> 50:10.966
[laughter]

50:12.801 --> 50:16.179
I have to put my hand
on a man's shoulder

50:16.263 --> 50:18.515
to guide me across the room.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.600
-I'm like…
-[laughter]

50:24.771 --> 50:27.649
I go… [clenched] "Joey, we gotta get
the fuck outta here."

50:28.191 --> 50:31.319
And we do. Do you know where we go?
To the airport. Yay.

50:31.403 --> 50:32.779
[laughter]

50:32.863 --> 50:35.490
Let's have a panic attack
in a tube in the sky.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.536
I'm walking through
Miami International Airport

50:39.619 --> 50:42.414
freaking people the fuck out.
All right?

50:42.497 --> 50:46.960
You know why? I forget how to walk.
I forget how to walk.

50:47.043 --> 50:49.755
I can't figure out the fuckin'
body scanner thing.

50:49.838 --> 50:50.922
I'm like… [snickers]

50:51.006 --> 50:52.924
[laughter]

50:56.011 --> 50:58.180
[nervously] "Can you hear
my heartbeat too?"

50:58.263 --> 51:00.265
-[titters]
-[laughter]

51:00.348 --> 51:02.976
[scattered applause]

51:05.145 --> 51:07.522
I'm sweating, but I'm cold. You know?

51:08.398 --> 51:11.359
Asking everyone for blankets, like,
"Do you have a blanket?"

51:12.319 --> 51:13.653
"I want a blanket!"

51:14.279 --> 51:17.491
They're like, "You're on the toilet.
Get the fuck outta here."

51:17.574 --> 51:19.576
[laughter]

51:21.119 --> 51:23.997
I pass out in a meditative state.

51:24.706 --> 51:27.167
On this flight. I do.
Then I just wake up scared.

51:27.250 --> 51:31.004
You ever wake up just terrified?
Like, I sit up and I'm like, "Ah!"

51:31.087 --> 51:32.255
[laughter]

51:32.339 --> 51:33.924
"Why am I a bad person?"

51:34.007 --> 51:35.217
[laughter]

51:35.300 --> 51:37.135
And I do something I've never done.

51:37.219 --> 51:38.470
A flight attendant

51:38.553 --> 51:39.846
passes down the aisle,

51:39.930 --> 51:42.682
and as she passes, I grab her arm.

51:42.766 --> 51:43.850
Hard.

51:44.476 --> 51:47.354
Like I'm gonna put it on my dick.
Like, I grab it.

51:47.437 --> 51:49.940
[laughter]

51:50.023 --> 51:52.108
And she's stunned. So she goes…

51:52.192 --> 51:53.944
-[exclaims]
-[laughter]

51:54.027 --> 51:55.695
And I'm so fucked up,

51:55.779 --> 51:58.323
I go, "Wait, how come? Do you know?"

51:58.406 --> 52:01.368
[raucous laughter]

52:04.120 --> 52:05.247
"Why are we alive?"

52:05.330 --> 52:07.499
And she's like, "What? What?"

52:08.458 --> 52:11.670
Now luckily
I have a decent friend with me, Shaun.

52:11.753 --> 52:13.964
He interjects, goes, "He took an Ambien."

52:14.047 --> 52:17.050
She's like, "Okay."
She just keeps going down the aisle.

52:17.133 --> 52:19.052
[laughter]

52:20.303 --> 52:22.722
Now he's worried about me,
so he wakes Joey up.

52:22.806 --> 52:25.225
He goes, "Joey!"
And Joey's like, "What?"

52:25.892 --> 52:27.602
He goes, "What did you give Tom?"

52:27.686 --> 52:29.855
He goes, "I gave him 200 milligrams."

52:29.938 --> 52:32.566
[audience exclaims, laughs]

52:33.358 --> 52:34.943
"Dipped in hash oil."

52:35.026 --> 52:36.820
[audience exclaiming]

52:36.903 --> 52:38.989
I go… [slurred]
"Why you do that to me?"

52:39.072 --> 52:40.907
[laughter]

52:41.908 --> 52:44.327
He goes, "You're gonna
see the devil now, bitch."

52:44.411 --> 52:46.329
[laughter]

52:46.413 --> 52:48.999
[resounding cheers and applause]

52:52.168 --> 52:54.087
[audience member whistles]

52:55.005 --> 52:56.631
[applause fades]

52:56.715 --> 52:58.842
I go, "I think I'm fuckin'
looking at him."

52:58.925 --> 53:00.176
[laughter]

53:00.260 --> 53:02.596
And let's rewind, by the way.
He took five.

53:03.471 --> 53:05.515
He's on a thousand milligrams.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.767
Like… [yawns]
"What are you doing tomorrow?"

53:07.851 --> 53:10.687
"I'm going to the hospital tomorrow.
What are you doing?"

53:11.229 --> 53:12.439
Psycho.

53:12.522 --> 53:14.524
[crowd chuckling]

53:14.608 --> 53:18.945
But listen to me. If you have never been
surprise megadosed,

53:19.029 --> 53:22.115
-it is horrific.
-[laughter]

53:22.198 --> 53:26.328
It is a harrowing,
panic-induced terror ride.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.079
And so a few weeks ago,

53:28.163 --> 53:29.831
I did it to my mother. Uh…

53:29.915 --> 53:33.418
-[laughter]
-[scattered cheers, applause]

53:33.501 --> 53:34.377
I did.

53:35.629 --> 53:39.633
I was visiting her. She's alone.
She knows I eat them at night.

53:39.716 --> 53:42.052
I've told her they help me sleep,
which they do.

53:42.135 --> 53:46.056
And she calls them "gummies." So…
She comes up to me and she's like…

53:46.139 --> 53:49.225
[slightly accented]
"Are you going to have a gummy tonight?"

53:50.143 --> 53:52.103
And I go, "Yes."

53:52.187 --> 53:53.855
She goes, "May I have one?"

53:54.648 --> 53:56.650
And I was like… [laughs] "Yeah."

53:56.733 --> 53:58.318
[laughter]

53:58.401 --> 53:59.861
I give her one

53:59.945 --> 54:01.655
because I take one.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.782
And one gets me high, so I'm like,

54:03.865 --> 54:06.618
"This is gonna peel back her wig."
You know?

54:06.701 --> 54:08.370
[laughter]

54:08.954 --> 54:12.999
I sit around with her for a couple hours.
Then I ask her, "How do you feel?"

54:13.083 --> 54:16.086
She goes…
[with emphasis] "I feel nothing."

54:16.169 --> 54:17.420
[laughter]

54:17.504 --> 54:19.589
Like, "Really?" She goes, "Yes."

54:20.548 --> 54:23.551
I go, "All right. I don't know.
Go to bed, you fuckin' savage."

54:23.635 --> 54:26.429
-"I don't know what to tell you."
-[laughter]

54:26.513 --> 54:30.100
The next day, it's evening
and she comes up to me again.

54:30.183 --> 54:33.645
[mimics accent]
"May I have another gummy tonight?"

54:34.479 --> 54:37.023
I go, "You had one yesterday.
You didn't feel anything."

54:37.107 --> 54:40.652
-She goes, "Maybe I should take two."
-[laughter]

54:40.735 --> 54:42.487
[clicks tongue]
"Maybe you should."

54:42.570 --> 54:43.613
[laughter]

54:43.697 --> 54:45.615
I give her two. We hang out.

54:45.699 --> 54:47.909
And again, I ask her,

54:47.993 --> 54:49.953
"How do you feel?" She goes…

54:50.036 --> 54:53.081
[with emphasis] "I feel nothing."

54:53.164 --> 54:54.541
I'm like, "Really?"

54:55.250 --> 54:57.627
She goes, "Should I take two more?"

54:58.753 --> 55:02.215
I said, "Hey, Pablo, you might wanna
keep it in first for a minute."

55:02.298 --> 55:03.591
[laughter]

55:03.675 --> 55:05.927
She goes, "You don't think so?"

55:06.011 --> 55:09.014
I go, "Actually, I do think so.
Here. Here's two more."

55:09.097 --> 55:10.306
I give it to her.

55:10.390 --> 55:14.561
She eats them. And then she says,
"I'm going to bed." I go, "All right."

55:14.644 --> 55:17.230
She goes to her room.
I go to the guest room.

55:17.313 --> 55:19.399
A few minutes later…

55:19.482 --> 55:20.650
[crowd chuckles]

55:20.734 --> 55:23.862
…I receive a series of text messages

55:24.946 --> 55:27.323
that I have since memorized.

55:27.407 --> 55:29.492
[laughter]

55:30.410 --> 55:34.122
The first one says, "Tommy, I am fizzing."

55:34.205 --> 55:36.416
[laughter]

55:36.499 --> 55:38.752
F-I-Z-Z…

55:39.711 --> 55:41.046
I-N-G.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.590
I write back, "Sounds cool."

55:43.673 --> 55:45.550
[laughter]

55:45.633 --> 55:48.303
'Cause who the fuck is like,
"I'm fizzing right now"?

55:48.386 --> 55:50.972
[laughter]

55:51.056 --> 55:54.434
[scattered applause, cheers]

55:54.517 --> 55:57.645
"We out here fizzing tonight, baby."
I don't know what that is.

55:58.563 --> 56:02.108
She writes back, "My heart rate is 125."

56:02.192 --> 56:03.818
[crowd chuckles]

56:03.902 --> 56:05.653
"Oh, I am spinning."

56:07.447 --> 56:09.991
So I write, "LOL."
I think she's having fun.

56:10.075 --> 56:11.910
[laughter]

56:12.702 --> 56:15.830
Then she writes,
"Please come now. I don't feel well."

56:17.248 --> 56:18.833
I go into her room

56:18.917 --> 56:22.378
-and my mother is seated upright.
-[laughter]

56:22.462 --> 56:25.882
In b… That is an alarming look.
For an elderly woman?

56:26.925 --> 56:28.760
Most of them lay down or lean.

56:28.843 --> 56:30.470
She's just in bed, like…

56:30.553 --> 56:32.806
[laughter]

56:32.889 --> 56:35.558
I go, "Are you okay?"
She goes… [hoarsely] "No."

56:35.642 --> 56:37.018
[laughter]

56:37.102 --> 56:40.647
So I take her out to the patio.
I'm thinking, "Fresh air." You know?

56:40.730 --> 56:42.774
It's clear immediately

56:42.857 --> 56:45.193
that we are in for a ride.

56:45.276 --> 56:47.529
[laughter]

56:47.612 --> 56:49.697
The first thing she does, she goes…

56:49.781 --> 56:53.284
-[smacks lips rapidly]
-[laughter]

56:53.368 --> 56:54.869
[mimics accent] "My lips!"

56:56.704 --> 56:58.248
"They are stuck together."

56:58.331 --> 57:00.250
[laughter]

57:00.333 --> 57:01.793
[scattered applause]

57:07.298 --> 57:09.175
I go, "I'll get you some water."

57:09.259 --> 57:10.802
[crowd chuckling]

57:10.885 --> 57:12.971
And she goes, "Why am I hungry?"

57:13.054 --> 57:14.472
[laughter]

57:14.556 --> 57:16.933
-I said, "'Cause it's working."
-[laughter]

57:17.559 --> 57:20.478
And she goes, "The dog was here.
The dog is gone?"

57:21.187 --> 57:22.897
And I go, "Oh my God."

57:22.981 --> 57:24.566
[laughter]

57:24.649 --> 57:27.068
I start to laugh so…

57:28.027 --> 57:29.237
destructively hard.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.655
[laughter]

57:30.738 --> 57:33.533
It… It is not, "Ha-ha-ha."

57:33.616 --> 57:36.369
It is a deep, primal…

57:36.453 --> 57:40.373
I'm watching my 77-year-old mother
get high.

57:40.457 --> 57:43.835
I'm not laughing, my nervous system
is shutting down, all right?

57:43.918 --> 57:46.087
[laughter]

57:46.171 --> 57:48.256
I mean, I'm watching her look at sounds.

57:48.339 --> 57:49.424
You know, she's like…

57:49.507 --> 57:51.634
[laughter]

57:55.054 --> 57:57.807
It hurts. It hurts how hard…
My esoph… I'm like…

57:57.891 --> 58:00.768
[raspy exhaling]

58:01.478 --> 58:05.106
As I'm laughing, I look at her.
And at one moment,

58:05.190 --> 58:07.692
her face contorts.

58:07.775 --> 58:09.944
Her face goes…

58:10.528 --> 58:12.489
[laughter]

58:13.364 --> 58:15.074
And she looks at me.

58:15.158 --> 58:20.330
And she goes, "Tomorrow, your laughter
will be tears on my corpse."

58:20.413 --> 58:22.999
-And I'm like…
-[audience exclaims]

58:23.082 --> 58:24.250
"What?!"

58:26.044 --> 58:28.213
She goes, "It's the perfect murder."

58:28.296 --> 58:30.006
[laughter]

58:30.089 --> 58:32.091
"Nobody will know it was you."

58:33.343 --> 58:35.762
My lungs invert at this point.

58:35.845 --> 58:38.348
And I have tears streaming

58:38.973 --> 58:40.058
down my face.

58:40.141 --> 58:43.228
She's so high, she thinks my laughter

58:43.311 --> 58:45.438
is confirming her thoughts.

58:45.522 --> 58:46.648
[laughter]

58:46.731 --> 58:50.235
She starts to legit plead for her life.

58:50.318 --> 58:51.528
[laughter continues]

58:51.611 --> 58:53.404
She goes, "Tommy, please!"

58:54.155 --> 58:55.657
"Please!"

58:55.740 --> 58:56.991
"Don't kill me!"

58:57.075 --> 58:58.117
[laughter]

58:58.201 --> 58:59.786
"I am your mother!"

58:59.869 --> 59:01.329
[laughter continues]

59:01.412 --> 59:03.206
I fuckin' pass out in a chair.

59:03.289 --> 59:04.707
I'm like… [grunts]

59:04.791 --> 59:06.960

[resounding cheers]

59:16.844 --> 59:18.429
[applause fades]

59:18.513 --> 59:20.890
I wake. I don't even know
where the fuck I am.

59:21.724 --> 59:23.017
It's morning.

59:23.101 --> 59:25.853
I walk into the kitchen
at the same time as her.

59:25.937 --> 59:27.230
I go, "Hey, Mom."

59:27.313 --> 59:30.441
And she doesn't say anything.
I'm like, "Oh, shit."

59:30.525 --> 59:33.653
She just walks over to the coffee maker
and she goes…

59:33.736 --> 59:34.737
[sucks teeth]

59:34.821 --> 59:39.200
-"I know you tried to kill me last night."
-[clamorous laughter]

59:43.538 --> 59:45.623
"It was very clever."

59:45.707 --> 59:48.293
[laughter continues]

59:48.376 --> 59:50.169
"But I am still here, Tommy."

59:50.253 --> 59:51.879
[laughter]

59:52.755 --> 59:56.384
I go, "I didn't try to kill you."
She goes, "Oh yes, you did."

59:57.510 --> 59:59.053
So I leave for the day.

59:59.137 --> 01:00:00.513
I come back later.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.473
I go, "Look, I owe you an apology."

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.684
"I should not have let you eat that much.
I'm sorry."

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:06.394
She goes, "It's okay. I forgive you."

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:09.063
I'm like, "Really? Thank you.
Makes me feel better."

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.232
She goes, "I want to tell you one thing."

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:12.609
And I go, "What?"

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:15.361
She goes, "I want another gummy tonight."

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:16.613
And I go, "What?"

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:19.032
She eats them every day now.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.868
-She's doing coke. She grew her bush out.
-[laughter]

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.369
She's fuckin' the neighbors.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.496
-She's living her best life.
-[cheering]

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.790
If you ever meet her, give her drugs.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:30.793
Thank you guys very much for coming out.
Have a great night.
