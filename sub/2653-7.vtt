WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.816
I sure hope Mom and Dad are surprised...

00:04.872 --> 00:07.512
by this anniversary breakfast
we're bringing them!

00:07.575 --> 00:09.885
I'd hate to walk in on them
if they're naked!

00:09.943 --> 00:11.946
Yes, that kind of image
could haunt someone...

00:12.013 --> 00:14.687
as she tries to fall asleep
even years later.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.059
Oh, relax. I think you're safe.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.791
Or are they?

00:18.853 --> 00:21.333
It's our 20th anniversary,
so today at the school fair...

00:21.389 --> 00:25.337
a band called the Dad Beats is gonna
surprise Claire with a power love ballad.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.533
And the lead singer-
You might wanna sit down-

00:28.596 --> 00:32.668
is the one and only,
get up on your feet, this guy!

00:33.868 --> 00:38.283
♪ She's a pretty sight
Wise as a Buddha ♪

00:38.339 --> 00:43.254
♪ But, brother, watch that bite
'cause she's a Claire-acuda ♪♪

00:43.310 --> 00:46.291
Or maybe an existing song.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.849
Thank you.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.359
♪ Hey, hey♪

00:50.418 --> 00:52.455

01:01.228 --> 01:03.333
Do you wanna get your face painted
like a pretty butterfly?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.604
No, I'm just not in the mood.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.168
Lily, what about you?

01:07.234 --> 01:08.872
You know what?
Maybe I will have them paint...

01:08.936 --> 01:10.540
"Worst Coach Ever" on my forehead.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.584
Cam's coaching freshman football...

01:12.640 --> 01:14.142
and his team's losing...

01:14.208 --> 01:17.018
and it's making him a- a little tense.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.991
Run! Run! Protect it like it's your baby!

01:20.047 --> 01:21.720
You dropped your baby!

01:21.782 --> 01:23.193
They're running away with your baby!

01:23.250 --> 01:24.388
Go get your baby!

01:24.452 --> 01:25.829
That's the worst call...

01:25.886 --> 01:29.197
since they cast Russell Crowe in Les Mis.
Right there!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.793
- You see the way everyone's glaring at me?
- No.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.634
- Like a big loser coach?
- All in your head.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.139
I'm the Hester Prynne
of freshman football.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.540
I may as well have
a scarlet "L" sewn on my shirt.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.236
Then everyone would think you're Laverne.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.371
- Coach Tucker.
- Oh, hey.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.437
That was a tough loss last night.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.041
Yep, yep. Sure was.
I feel your frustration. Sure do.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.417
Uh, Mitchell, this is John.
He's Trevor's dad.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.921
- Sorry.
- Star running back.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.513
Well, maybe not for long.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.855
- I'm seriously thinking about pulling him from the team.
- What? Why?

01:53.914 --> 01:55.416
'Cause Trevor's getting killed out there.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.985
Got no one to block for him.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.657
I-i hear what you're saying,
and you're not wrong...

01:59.720 --> 02:01.393
but give me a little time.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.368
- You got one week.
- Hey!

02:04.425 --> 02:07.429
Well, that is not
appropriate fair behavior at all.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.997
You know what might make you feel better?

02:09.062 --> 02:11.065
Gathering my team
and putting the fear of God in them.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.305
- I was gonna say a churro.
- I can do both!

02:14.435 --> 02:17.211
- She's a mess.
- Girl.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.516
Hey, lead foot, easy on the turns.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.951
I worked hours on this cake.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.784
You're sure you wanna do this?

02:23.844 --> 02:26.450
I'm going to win the cake contest.
And then there'll be no stopping me.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.586
- From what, a beating?
- First place ribbons earn respect, Jay.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.187
Not if your competition's
a bunch of old ladies and weirdos.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.789
Could you just be nice?

02:33.854 --> 02:37.063
You didn't seem to care when you were
eating all his practice cake.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.501
Finally.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.034
What are you gonna do, pal?

02:41.095 --> 02:43.041
'Bout to ask you the same thing.

02:43.097 --> 02:45.202
- Did you not see my blinker?
- Nope.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.768
Then you're blind, 'cause it's on.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.246
Looking at you, I'm guessing
it was on the whole way here.

02:49.303 --> 02:52.307
I got all day and satellite radio!

02:52.373 --> 02:54.910
I don't care if parking here
is on your bucket list.

02:54.975 --> 02:59.117
I got two books on tape, a space blanket
and a protein bar in the glove box.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.989
I will sleep here if I have to.

03:01.048 --> 03:04.052
- We're not moving.
- Ay. But we are. Let's go, Manny.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.804
- Who are you?
- Oh, my God, you scared the hell out of me.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.778
Okay. Language.
There's a baby in the house.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.644
Uh, that baby happens to be my uncle.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.377
Oh. Which one are you?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.646
I need to tell Mr. P.
you broke one of his beers.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.688
I'm Alex. Who are you?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.950
- I'm their manny.
- Nice try.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.117
I know their Manny,
and you look nothing like him.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.785
Oh, you're Haley.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.159
I'm their male nanny, Andy.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.926
You really need to move.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.864
Okay, well, I'll be out by the pool.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.993
What? Nope. No, no, no.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.560
Not without permission, you're not.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.537
- I'm gonna call Mr. and Mrs. P.
- Oh, wait.

03:47.595 --> 03:52.704
Um, seriously, Mandy, do you, uh-
do you really have to do that?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.803
I see what you're doing.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.644
Don't bother, because I have a girlfriend
of eight years back in Utah.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.981
That's pretty young, but I guess
they do things differently over there.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.816
She's my age, and we're engaged.
To be engaged.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.823
It's- it's a pre-engagement.
She's in the coast guard.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.381
- In Utah?
- Yeah.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.155
It's the largest salt lake
in the western hemisphere.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.991
Oh, good.
She's protecting our lake.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.553
I'll be out by the pool.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.191
Your boss is calling you.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.834
Hey! There she is.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.031
- Yeah, I'm not giving you any money.
- I don't need your money.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.702
I need advice. About a girl.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.904
Gross, but I'm intrigued, so talk.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.038
Alex. Hey, girlita.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.583
Sienna! Girl!

04:31.639 --> 04:33.846
Sienna is amazing.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.648
Stylish, worldly.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.814
And she's so new to our school,
she doesn't even realize...

04:37.878 --> 04:39.880
that I'm a full social class below her.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.861
I need to cement the friendship
before she finds out we have a cafeteria.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.521
I've been looking all over for you.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.999
Uh, this is my little brother, Luke.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.332
He wants advice on some lame crush he has.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.497
- That's huge.
- So huge.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.404
So, Luke, who is this mystery woman?

04:56.463 --> 04:59.205
Um, just some girl.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.746
And her name is Sienna.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.010
You know, Manny,
I'm just gonna say this one last time.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.384
- I doubt that.
- Gimme that.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.945
You wanna fit in?

05:11.011 --> 05:13.617
You're not doing yourself any favors
with this cake contest.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.217
I don't know. Chefs get all the girls.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.989
You're a baker. Bakers are girls-

05:17.051 --> 05:19.463
Betty Crocker, Mrs. Fields, Little Debbie.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.090
What about the Pillsbury Doughboy?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.999
That's a good one, Manny.

05:24.058 --> 05:27.403
Well, well, well. Jay Pritchett.
Nice of you to finally show up.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.338
- What's happening?
- You're an official fair cop.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.137
- Your wife volunteered you.
- Gloria!

05:31.198 --> 05:32.575
I love you. Have fun!

05:32.633 --> 05:34.169
- What is this?
- It's for charity.

05:34.234 --> 05:37.215
People pay for you to arrest
and throw somebody in jail for 10 minutes.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.751
- And here comes your partner.
- What's up?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.650
Oh, hell, no.
I'm not working with this clown.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.087
Hey, who you calling a clown, bucket list?

05:44.144 --> 05:45.487
I see you two have already met.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.651
That was my space, and you know it.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.956
Tell it to my car.
You know where to find it.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.997
Hey! Enough of you two squabbling.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.362
I've got the P.T.A.
breathing down my neck.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.059
Just pin these on and get to work.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.399
Nope. Can't do the badge, sorry.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.269
My wife just bought me this shirt,
and if I ruin it, she'll kill me.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.501
- You're afraid you'll ruin your blouse.
- It's not a blouse.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.908
It's a shirt. She bought it at
the men's department, so it's a shirt.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.737
Here's your first arrest.
She's over at the Dizzy Dragon.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.010
Word on the midway is
she's tougher than she looks.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.416
- Think you can handle it?
- Why couldn't I handle it?

06:14.475 --> 06:15.977
'Cause she's your daughter.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.851
Hello?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.894
Oh, hi, Mr. Chang. Yeah.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.520
What do you mean
you're at the house already?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.326
You're not supposed to be there
for another two hours.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.596
I have a long history of giving Phil
bad anniversary gifts.

06:29.656 --> 06:32.296
But this year,
I have planned something amazing.

06:32.359 --> 06:35.203
The traditional 20th gift is china,
but what am I gonna do?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.105
Give him a plate?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.666
I already did that.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.306
Okay. Bye.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.679
Honey, um, what do you say
we pack it in and go home?

06:44.738 --> 06:47.810
What? No. We just got here.
I haven't even whacked a mole yet.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.378
I know, but I just got off the Ferris wheel,
and I'm feeling really queasy.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.185
- But you're gonna miss the Dad Beats.
- Well-

06:52.246 --> 06:54.692
No way. Come on.
Let's get you a fried pickle.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.284
Phil, I might throw up.

06:56.350 --> 07:00.457
Uh-uh.
No one throws up until I sing.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.000
We gotta go. We gotta go home now.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.966
Sure, why not? Nothing keeping you here.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.231
- Why are you acting weird?
- I'm not acting weird.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.136
- Well-
- Got her! Ma'am?

07:08.195 --> 07:10.004
I am afraid you are under arrest.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.839
Uh, no. Dad, tell him
I can't do this right now.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.504
- Come on, please.
- Go ahead, read her the charges.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.206
Can't do this.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.012
All right, let's see. You have been charged
with unlawful sexiness...

07:19.072 --> 07:21.575
- and possession of a hot booty.
- That is wrong.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.383
- Guilty as charged.
- Stop it!

07:23.444 --> 07:25.583
- All right. Ten minutes in the slammer.
- No, I can't.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.853
I don't have time for this. Phil!

07:34.455 --> 07:36.332
Oh, my God. What are you doing, perv?

07:36.390 --> 07:39.530
Getting proof of where the two missing beers
went. You can't drink that out here.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.595
Hmm. Let's see if you're right.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.500
Mmm. No.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.774
Okay. Well, you're in a pool zone,
and that is glass.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.906
So that's not safe. it's dangerous.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.211
What is with you and your girlfriend
protecting water?

07:52.272 --> 07:53.910
- Okay, just- if you just-
- No.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.385
- Just-
- Uh, uh, oh!

07:55.442 --> 07:57.683
Oh!
Oh, dilly.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.781
Now you've done it.
You're going to have to climb in there...

07:59.847 --> 08:01.349
and get all the glass out of the pool.

08:01.415 --> 08:04.191
Um, I just got my hair straightened,
so that's not gonna happen.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.454
I hate to go all ballistic...

08:06.520 --> 08:09.433
but it has not been
a pleasure meeting you.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.800
Do you kiss your imaginary girlfriend
with that mouth?

08:11.859 --> 08:15.363
I do. But she's real, so-
She's a real girl.

08:15.429 --> 08:18.933
It all comes down to one thing, gentlemen.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.842
Focus.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.382
And teamwork and heart.

08:24.438 --> 08:25.781
You see this mallet?

08:25.839 --> 08:29.116
Think I can swing
this here mallet with one finger?

08:29.943 --> 08:33.254
No. I need my whole team.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.486
Because when you're functioning
and working as a team...

08:36.549 --> 08:39.155
gentlemen, look out!

08:39.219 --> 08:41.698
- Sassy granny?
- Yeah, sassy granny.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.256
Yes, exactly!

08:43.323 --> 08:45.929
Because that is what you all
played like last night-

08:45.993 --> 08:48.974
is a bunch of sassy grannies.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.805
We're gonna bust our humps this week,
and we're gonna get out there...

08:51.865 --> 08:54.243
and we're gonna play like a bunch of-

08:54.301 --> 08:55.678
Girly men. Got it.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.647
Okay, you know what?
Is this thing, uh, plugged in?

08:57.704 --> 09:00.844
It's not electric.
I think it was made in the 1800s.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.855
Okay, well, that's my point.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.413
This is outdated.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.857
This is offensive,
because girls are athletes too.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.020
So, in conclusion...

09:12.286 --> 09:14.197
if you wanna win football games...

09:14.254 --> 09:17.201
we gotta go out there and play like a-

09:20.060 --> 09:23.007
- What is Daddy doing?
- Daddy's smashing his demons.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.065
Oh, like the ones you vacuum up at home?

09:25.132 --> 09:26.668
Yeah, like that.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.847
Mmm. Damn. Near miss.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.110
Why the hell are you so dressed up
for a school fair, anyway?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.709
How is this dressed up? I'm-

09:34.775 --> 09:37.119
Why? Because my shirt has buttons?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.679
What's that fabric? Is that silk?

09:38.745 --> 09:41.521
Get your vanilla fingers
away from my shirt.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.892
- Blouse.
- Okay.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.363
You wanna talk about clothes?
Let's talk about clothes. Let's go.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.401
Let's see. You look like some kind of
old, washed-up golf pro...

09:49.456 --> 09:53.404
who drank his way off the tour and is
one step away from writing a suicide note...

09:53.460 --> 09:55.736
with one of them little pencils.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.809
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.041
Wouldn't have said it
if you didn't mean it.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.646
I don't have the body
to wear the clothes they make today...

10:07.708 --> 10:09.210
so I dress comfortable.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.052
You're in shape, man.
What are you, late 50s?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.388
Come on. You know I'm not.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.827
I'm serious, man.
You look like you live at the gym.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.386
- I do some walking.
- Yeah?

10:19.453 --> 10:20.955
Pritchett, Williams.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.331
- Got another arrest over by the Ferris wheel.
- On it.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.960
Here we go.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.008
Why'd we throw out the ice cream?
We got plenty of time.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.079
Quit it!

10:37.137 --> 10:38.377
Come on, man. Give it back.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.940
Seeing Manny up there...

10:40.007 --> 10:42.317
with the misfits and their crazy. cakes...

10:42.376 --> 10:45.220
I started to wonder if Jay was right.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.589
Maybe Manny would fit in better
if he was more like the other boys.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.129
And maybe I needed to give him a little push.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.300
I saw you.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.874
All right, young lady.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.706
- You're under arrest.
- What?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.303
You have the right to remain silent.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.405
- Good luck with that.
- Grandpa!

11:10.470 --> 11:13.007
Sorry, honey. Part of the job.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.575
- Out of the way!
- Let's go.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.678
Who did this?

11:16.743 --> 11:18.552
Hmm. Guess it's just you and me.

11:20.747 --> 11:24.217
My cake! Somebody ruined it.
Who would do that?

11:24.284 --> 11:27.231
Ay. Manny, how terrible.
All your hard work.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.664
Oh, well. Let's go ride the ride.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.633
No, Mom. I know who did it.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.898
- Oh, you do?
- It was Enid.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.461
- Ah.
- Look at her.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.064
You can see the hate in her eyes.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.938
The minute she saw this,
she felt threatened.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.377
She's cold as ice.

11:41.435 --> 11:45.144
How 'bout you just let it go
and go play with the other boys?

11:45.205 --> 11:46.980
Oh, she'd love that.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.882
Okay, Enid.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.582
You wanna dance? Let's dance.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.623
Hey. Let me have my cell phone.
Come on. I gotta make a call.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.188
Sorry, those are the rules.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.598
- What are you smiling at?
- I'm six.

12:03.657 --> 12:06.194
- Oh, God.
- All right. Got another one for you here.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.260
Hi, honey.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.499
- Come on.
- Hmm.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.599
One count of being
an aggravating big sister.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.166
That's eight to 10 minutes.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.270
- Luke did this? I was just trying to help him.
- Help him do what?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.441
My friend Sienna and I were trying to help him
find this girl he has a crush on.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.883
Honey, Sienna is the girl
he has a crush on.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.943
Come on. Haven't you ever seen
the way he looks at her?

12:23.009 --> 12:25.046
The same way he used to look
at Halloween candy.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.319
Oh, my God. He's gonna do something stupid
and ruin it for me.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.791
I have to get out of here.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.159
Okay. All right. I got a plan. I got this.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.028
I'm gonna create a distraction.
It's gonna get that little guard over here.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.795
- You're gonna sit down very quietly right by this door.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.838
Great plan, Mom.
Let me know how that works out for you.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.540
- It's a fake lock.
- How long were you gonna sit on that?

12:49.302 --> 12:52.181
Found another one. I told you.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.686
Are you gonna do that every time?
You found glass, not the lost city of Atlanta.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.382
Wow, I'm gonna chalk that one up
to a lot of underage drinking.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.924
- You're bleeding.
- What?

12:59.980 --> 13:02.483
Oh! Oh! I do not like blood.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.153
I do not like blood. Is it bad?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.322
Here. Oh, my God!

13:06.386 --> 13:09.265
- What?
- Your fingers are so stubby, like baby carrots.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.495
Sure. Okay. Make fun.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.198
Till you need me to reach into a vending
machine. Then I'm everyone's best friend.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.207
Here, hold still.
Let me put some pressure on it.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.439
So why are you a manny anyway?

13:19.499 --> 13:22.446
Saving up for college. Plus, I like kids.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.450
'Cause they make your hands seem normal?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.451
Okay. Thank you.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.077
I'm good. Thank you.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.486
Luke, I hate to say it,
but maybe this girl left.

13:33.547 --> 13:36.926
It's probably for the best.
I mean, even if we found her-

13:36.983 --> 13:38.758
Forget it. it's embarrassing.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.423
No. Tell me.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.958
I wouldn't know what to do.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.525
I've never kissed a girl before.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.537
Oh. it's not that hard.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.301
You know what? I'll kiss you once
to show you how it's done.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.308
Really? Okay!
Wanna go behind the Dumpster?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.139
No, here is fine.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.876
Okay. it's not really
how I imagined it, but-

13:57.938 --> 13:59.315
- Stop!
- What?

13:59.372 --> 14:00.646
Ignore her. Where were we?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.311
You're the girl! You're his crush!

14:02.375 --> 14:04.548
He's being a little weirdo.
Please don't judge me!

14:04.611 --> 14:06.522
Uh, Luke, is this true?

14:06.580 --> 14:08.082
She's a nerd! Her friends are books.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.889
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to her.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.453
- Alex?
- Um, I don't know what he's talking about.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.760
Okay, I'm just gonna go
catch up with some friends.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.595
Sienna, wait!

14:19.192 --> 14:21.263
Don't be sad.
You're too good for her anyways.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.171
Yeah. Thanks, Alex.

14:23.230 --> 14:26.939
Not you! I was talking about myself,
you little gnome.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.775
There he is.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.779
One more arrest,
and we can hang up our badges.

14:31.838 --> 14:35.047
I seen this punk horsing around earlier.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.155
Jail time, jean jacket.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.498
- Is it bad?
- You're gonna be fine.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.125
I should have worn a vest.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.000
♪♪ Why is everyone just standing around?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.936
Get this man a towel for his blouse!

14:54.995 --> 14:59.375
So cold.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.414
We were almost out.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.847
I didn't want it to end like this.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.543
Don't you do that! it's not over.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.108
Listen to me.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.086
I need you to tell my wife what happened.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.251
- Tell her it wasn't my fault.
- You're gonna tell her yourself!

15:15.315 --> 15:17.955
- She's standing right there, and she looks pissed.
- Uh-

15:18.852 --> 15:21.696
Hi, baby.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.098
Phil, when I said we needed
to go home, I meant it.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.161
I'm sorry. I should have listened to you.

15:28.228 --> 15:31.209
But you have to stay for just one song.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.540
- Why?
- Trust me.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.171

16:25.018 --> 16:26.929

16:26.987 --> 16:29.433
because, apparently,
it's the cure for everything.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.025

17:03.757 --> 17:05.531
Holy cow!

17:05.592 --> 17:08.071
Who knew?

17:08.127 --> 17:11.233
Let's keep this party going.
Next up, we have one more guest today.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.674
Oh. No.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.576
- Harold! Harold!

But in the meantime...

17:24.210 --> 17:26.713
the Dad Beats are proud to present...

17:26.780 --> 17:28.088
Phil Dunphy!

17:28.147 --> 17:31.186
- Paul who?
- Phil?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.628
Phil Dunphy.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.291
- Oh, Phil Dunphy.
- Oh, boy.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.801
There's a white minivan
out in the parking lot with its lights on...

17:46.866 --> 17:48.903
license plate number...

17:48.968 --> 17:52.074
TCB-R2D2.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.015
Phil Dunphy, everybody.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.692
- Hey, Mom, check it out. I finished my cake.
- Oh, good.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.957
It's Los Angeles after an 11 .5 earthquake.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.397
I call it "Earth-Cake."

18:08.455 --> 18:11.231
- Honey, that's amazing.
- You think that's amazing?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.862
Wait till I smash this thing right on top
of Enid's piece of sheet cake.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.497
Ay, no. No, wait! Manny-

18:15.562 --> 18:17.542
Enid didn't do it. I did it.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.635
- What?
- I was the one who ruined the cake.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.874
I was afraid that all those boys
were gonna make fun of you.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.749
I think I care more
about you fitting in than you do.

18:27.807 --> 18:31.254
No, I care. I care a lot.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.690
It's just the stuff I'm good at
isn't the stuff that makes you popular.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.159
Contestants, all cakes must be...

18:37.217 --> 18:40.164
at the judges' table in 60 seconds.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.826
Ay. there's no way we're gonna make it
through that crowd.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.869
Like heck we won't. Here.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.631
- What?
- Follow my lead.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.366
- Okay. ¡Ay.!
- Ready? Come on!

18:48.428 --> 18:51.500
Oh, well, look who finally
put down his mallet.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.238
- You done having your little temper tantrum?
- It wasn't that bad.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.143
Cam, your behavior
was completely juvenile...

18:56.202 --> 18:58.239
and I don't think it set
a very good example for-

18:58.304 --> 19:01.114
Hey! Hey! No cutsies. For Lily.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.051
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.613
I-I can't seem to turn this team
into a winner.

19:06.679 --> 19:10.786
Why do you let it get you so stressed out?
It's just football.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.024
You know what football was to me?
Football was my salvation.

19:14.087 --> 19:15.623
Every time I stepped onto that field...

19:15.688 --> 19:19.602
I wasn't the weird,
gay outsider kid anymore.

19:19.659 --> 19:23.106
I inspired my entire team
because I had something to prove.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.109
Where's my kid
that has something to prove?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.405
- Come on, Mom!
- ¡Ay.!

19:26.466 --> 19:28.412
Stay on my hip! Follow my lead! Move!

19:28.468 --> 19:30.607
That's exactly what I need.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.250
- Come on, Mom!
- Cake?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.515
Tell 'em the good news.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.523
- I won the cake contest!
- The other good news.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.923
- He made the football team.
- They won their first game.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.484
And the guys love my banana bread.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.425
Keep your eyes closed,
and before you open them...

19:48.488 --> 19:50.490
remember that for 20 years...

19:50.557 --> 19:54.266
you have given me perfect,
creative, thoughtful gifts...

19:54.327 --> 19:56.273
and every year, I have let you down.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.434
You're about to feel really bad.

19:58.498 --> 20:02.275
And I know that because
it's how I have felt every year.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.908
But, honey, it is not my intention,
because I love you.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.443
- Happy anniversary.
- Oh, my God.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.457
Chinese acrobats?

20:13.513 --> 20:17.393
Twenty years. China. You're brilliant.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.952
♪ I want to know what love is ♪

20:19.018 --> 20:21.020
- You got it!
- Hey, guys, you're my present!

20:21.087 --> 20:23.124
Oh! Oh, what's that?

20:23.189 --> 20:25.032
Oh!

20:25.091 --> 20:26.764
- That's the helicopter. I should get in there.
- No, no.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.102
They're- They're here for you.
They're here for you.

20:29.162 --> 20:30.835
♪ I want to feel what love is ♪

20:30.897 --> 20:32.638
- Oh.
- Honey.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.173
♪ I know you can show me ♪♪

20:41.774 --> 20:43.776
Don't worry.
It was just a couple of beers.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.345
And if you cleaned it up-

20:45.411 --> 20:46.913
Okay, Haley, I love you too. Bye-bye.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.391
'Scuse me, ma'am.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.758
I hear you're a wanted woman.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.229
What you see can and will
be held against you.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.288
You're gonna have to arrest me first.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.698
Bring me some wine.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.068
Mr. P., I have a confession to make.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.734
I'm taking a much more interesting
confession upstairs.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.299
After Joe went down...

21:06.366 --> 21:08.903
I had a sip of beer by the pool
and a bottle broke.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.208
It was me. I did it.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.908
Don't sweat it. I've popped a cold one...

21:11.971 --> 21:14.577
after dealing with those kids-
sometimes during.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.383
Thanks, Mr. P. And hey-

21:17.443 --> 21:19.650
- Be careful up there.
- We're not that close.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.191
Yeah.
