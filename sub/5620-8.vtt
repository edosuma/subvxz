to make rice with no water

00:12.792 --> 00:14.250
or rice.
I just boiled a pot.

00:14.333 --> 00:16.792
Just power through.
Tomorrow we'll be closed,

00:16.875 --> 00:18.792
and Jimmy will be enjoying
his Thanksgiving tradition

00:18.875 --> 00:21.417
of taking an upscale
catalog model to Malibu

00:21.500 --> 00:22.792
for lobster and facials.

00:22.875 --> 00:23.834
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

00:23.959 --> 00:25.375
None of your
business. You?

00:25.458 --> 00:27.792
None of your business.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.250
Last day before break, people.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.083
Everyone excited?

00:31.166 --> 00:33.250
For me to go to Malibu?

00:33.333 --> 00:35.792
(laughs)

00:35.875 --> 00:37.959
Kaylee Carmichael.
She's the third-most followed

00:38.041 --> 00:40.375
stomach model on Instagram,
but she's creeping up on second.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.792
Which reminds me. Everyone,

00:42.000 --> 00:43.875
follow "KayleeSixPack"
on Instagram,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.834
unfollow "CropTopTori."
Okay.

00:46.917 --> 00:48.875
Wait, so you're not doing
Thanksgiving with your family?

00:48.959 --> 00:50.875
Ah, see, this is
the beauty part.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.750
Now, they want me there
for Thanksgiving.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.834
I'm a big part of the family
now, and I want to be there.

00:54.959 --> 00:56.834
So, on my way to Malibu,
I'll be doing

00:56.959 --> 00:58.834
a classic Jimmy Martino drop-by.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.834
What's that, you ask?

01:00.959 --> 01:03.834
It's my foolproof system
for attending a party briefly,

01:03.959 --> 01:06.083
yet leaving a lifetime
of memories behind.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.583
So what I do is I slip in
unnoticed, right?

01:08.667 --> 01:09.875
So they think
I've been there a while.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.291
I compliment the turnout,
I have a few laughs,

01:12.375 --> 01:14.333
and then I say, "You know,
I'd love to stay longer,

01:14.375 --> 01:15.667
but I've got to go."

01:15.750 --> 01:17.709
(laughs) Now that
is so baller.

01:17.792 --> 01:18.875
Right?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.458
Did you do that
at my wedding?

01:20.542 --> 01:22.333
No. You kidding?
That was a great wedding.

01:22.417 --> 01:24.166
And a marvelous turnout,
by the way.
Yeah.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.750
It really was. It was.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.041
(chuckles)
I love you, Jimmy.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.625
Jimmy?

that awful song?

01:54.375 --> 01:55.709
Yeah, you're upsetting
our daughter.

01:55.792 --> 01:57.208
You guys have never heard

01:57.291 --> 01:58.875
the Thanksgiving song
"Turkey Time in the USA"?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.291
No, because you made it up
in the shower this morning.

02:01.375 --> 02:02.875
Busted. (chuckles)

02:03.000 --> 02:04.709
You can hear
what I do in the shower?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.583
Yep.
Oh. Uh, hey, uh,

02:06.667 --> 02:08.000
don't-don't use
that serving platter.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.458
Uh, use the silver one
Grandma gave us.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.959
Really? We never
use the nice stuff.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.583
That's because most of
our Thanksgivings were us

02:13.667 --> 02:15.291
eating Mexican takeout
from Benny Loco's

02:15.375 --> 02:16.959
while watching soap operas
in our sweats.

02:17.041 --> 02:17.959
That sounds amazing.

02:18.041 --> 02:19.166
It was the best.

02:19.250 --> 02:20.959
But, you know, I-I want it to be

02:21.041 --> 02:22.959
a little more special this year,
you know, for Edie.

02:23.041 --> 02:24.834
That little lump might actually
remember today.

02:24.959 --> 02:26.083
Uh, plus, uh,

02:26.166 --> 02:27.959
Benny Loco's
is now a vape store.

02:28.041 --> 02:30.834
I know. Every time
I drive past, I cry.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.500
And occasionally pop in.

02:33.583 --> 02:36.500
To tell them
it's a filthy habit.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.291
I promise, this year
is gonna be the start

02:38.333 --> 02:40.542
of an amazing
new Thanksgiving tradition.

02:40.625 --> 02:44.333
Whoa. Is it one where I can
still wear my sweats?

02:44.417 --> 02:45.959
Or, uh, some slacks
and a fun top

02:46.041 --> 02:47.375
that I already laid out
on your bed.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.458
SARA:
Aw.

02:50.083 --> 02:51.333
Hey, Jimmy.

02:51.417 --> 02:53.417
Been here a while,
you know?

02:53.500 --> 02:54.417
Really? Doing what?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.000
Just enjoying
this great turnout.

02:56.083 --> 02:57.500
SARA:
Turnout?

02:57.583 --> 02:58.875
There's three of us
and a baby.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Love it.
Everyone, this is Kaylee.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.667
You may recognize her from...

03:02.750 --> 03:04.000
Oh, yeah, I'm not
normally like this.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.000
I-I drank so much
water today.

03:06.083 --> 03:08.000
I mean, this...
isn't me.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.458
(chuckles) And, Kaylee,
this is everyone.

03:10.542 --> 03:12.417
Stop saying "everyone."
It's a tiny group.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.667
(chuckles):
Okay.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.000
Jimmy, do you want
to help Edie decorate

03:15.083 --> 03:16.166
some of the, uh,
hand turkey place cards?

03:16.250 --> 03:17.417
I'd love to.
Yeah.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.291
Come on, pork chop.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.166
I'm gonna help the kid
crank out some hand turkeys.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.083
We'll be out of here
in 30 minutes.
(mouths)

03:25.208 --> 03:27.875

give me a kiss. Ready?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.291
Okay, good.
Fast, faster.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.333
Good, thanks.

03:32.417 --> 03:35.417
No, I-I'll do it.
I'll do it.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.041
One right here, right here.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.417
Aah!

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
Where you going?

03:42.375 --> 03:44.041
(whistles)

03:44.125 --> 03:46.208
My whole thing is,
in every picture,

03:46.291 --> 03:48.083
my stomach is
telling a story.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.417
Oh. My stomach
just likes to tell the story

03:50.500 --> 03:51.875
of how much it likes bread.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.834
Fun top, by the way.

03:53.959 --> 03:56.041
Really? I was afraid
it was a weird cut.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.875
It's a little weird.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.041
All right, finished
with the hand turkeys.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.333
That was fast.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.458
And Edie can't draw
rainbows or ponies.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.041
You were supposed
to let her do that.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.875
Yeah, and you were supposed
to have two sleeves.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
(chuckles)

04:08.083 --> 04:09.125
Welp, that was

04:09.166 --> 04:10.250
a party for the ages.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.542
Remember?
You busted my balls

04:12.625 --> 04:14.083
about the hand
turkeys and all.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.792
Classic laugh.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.250
Is that 2:30?
Ooh.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.834
It's 2:30?
2:30.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.083
Got to go, sorry.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.875
Thank you, thank you.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.083
It's okay. Yeah, I figured
you wouldn't stay long.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.667
Not really your scene.
Thanks for coming.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.375
Aw, we had a great time, kid.

04:28.458 --> 04:30.625
A great long time full of
memories. Happy Thanksgiving.

04:30.709 --> 04:33.542
Oh! I clocked you
with a bag of yams.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.083
I'm sorry.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.083
Hi. Uh, and you are...?

04:37.166 --> 04:39.250
I think you mean,
"And<i> you </i>are?"

04:39.333 --> 04:40.959
Oh, uh, Jimmy, this is Bruce.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.750
Yeah, he's just coming back
from a yams run.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.792
Yep. Nice to meet you.
I'd love to stay and chat,

04:44.875 --> 04:46.417
but I got to give
these guys a bath.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.417
(Gerald laughs)

04:47.500 --> 04:49.083
The Bruce is loose!

04:49.166 --> 04:50.083
With the produce!

04:50.166 --> 04:52.125
(Gerald and Bruce laugh)

04:52.208 --> 04:54.125
(chuckles): Bruce is loose
with the produce.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.458
Who is he?

04:55.542 --> 04:57.250
Bruce used to date Mom
off and on.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.000
But, you know, even when
they weren't together,

04:59.083 --> 05:00.792
he was kind of like
a father to me.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.125
You know, always around,
taught me everything I know.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.333
Oh, he just got back from
living in Asia, and since

05:05.417 --> 05:08.125
he always spent Thanksgivings
with us, I, uh, I invited him.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.125
So he was sort of like
a fill-in dad?

05:10.208 --> 05:12.709
Yeah. But, you know, I've known
him longer than I known you,

05:12.792 --> 05:15.333
so, in a way,
you're the fill-in.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.125
(chuckles)

05:17.208 --> 05:19.333
We're all just people
at the end of the day.

05:19.417 --> 05:20.417
Hey, uh, Bruce.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.417
Edie's been asking for a ride

05:21.500 --> 05:22.709
on the Gobble Train.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.834
Next stop, Turkey Town!

05:24.959 --> 05:26.417

05:31.166 --> 05:32.834
Okay, we should
get to Malibu.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.375
I'm auditioning for this
diet margarita ad tomorrow,

05:35.458 --> 05:37.166
and I need to
build a base tan.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.417
Right. Base tan.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.166
Gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble...

05:40.250 --> 05:41.750
Best Thanksgiving ever,
right, Edie?

05:41.834 --> 05:43.542
Oh, uh,
bye, Jimmy.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.166
Gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble,
gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble,

05:45.250 --> 05:46.792
gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble,

05:46.834 --> 05:48.959
gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble,
gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble...

05:49.041 --> 05:50.166
(Edie babbles happily)

05:50.250 --> 05:52.166
Okay, let's go.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.500
Gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble,
gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble,

05:53.583 --> 05:55.166
gobble-gobble-gobble...

05:55.250 --> 05:57.667
When we get to Malibu,
should we go massage then beach

05:57.750 --> 05:59.166
or beach then massage?

05:59.250 --> 06:01.166
God, I hate dilemmas.

06:01.250 --> 06:04.166
How about that Bruce guy?
He's an odd duck, isn't he?

06:04.250 --> 06:06.166
I don't know,
he seemed cool.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.792
That gobble train
looked fun.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.208
You okay?
You look weird.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.625
I feel weird.

06:13.709 --> 06:16.834
I've got this twisty feeling
in my stomach.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.125
Probably a cramp.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.750
Oh, drink some
cactus water.

06:19.834 --> 06:21.667
No, no, uh, it's not
a muscle thing.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.750
It's a... I feel, like,

06:23.834 --> 06:25.709
this hot, angry,
nervous feeling,

06:25.792 --> 06:27.208
you know?
Oh.

06:27.291 --> 06:28.959
You're jealous of Bruce.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.208
(chuckles): Oh, come on.
I'm not jealous of Bruce.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.417
Okay.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.667
People get jealous of me.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.291
Okay, cool.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.291
KAYLEE:
Why are we turning around?

06:39.375 --> 06:41.166
JIMMY: Not jealousy,
I'll tell you that much.

06:43.834 --> 06:46.208
(blows raspberry)
Are you saying stop or are you
saying more? Do it again?

06:46.291 --> 06:47.709
(blows raspberry)

06:47.792 --> 06:49.125
(laughs)

06:49.208 --> 06:51.875
Hey, Bruce, give
her a juicy one.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
He used to always kill
me with the juicy ones.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.250
Oh, I'm so glad you
got to stick around.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.083
God, I really hope they clear
up that Malibu beach fire.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.166
I wonder if anything's
on the news.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.750
Probably not, probably not.

07:02.834 --> 07:04.959
So, why have you never
mentioned Bruce before?

07:05.041 --> 07:06.959
You embarrassed?
I could see why.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.750
No, it's probably just 'cause
he was out of the country.

07:09.834 --> 07:10.959
Mm, Asia.
Right, you said Asia.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.750
Sex tour type of thing?

07:12.792 --> 07:14.041
No. He's an
aeronautics engineer.

07:14.125 --> 07:15.583
Mm.

07:15.667 --> 07:18.166
Hey, Bruce, why'd they
send you to Beijing?

07:18.250 --> 07:20.959
Oh, I was contracting with NASA
to develop an end effector

07:21.041 --> 07:22.959
for astronauts
when they walk in space.

07:23.041 --> 07:25.875
But you yourself do<i> not </i>walk
in space, is what I'm hearing.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.166
No. Yeah, I spend all my days
just cooped up in a lab.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.834
Which is why it is so great
to get out in the fresh air

07:30.959 --> 07:32.166
and get my hands dirty.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.750
Hey, you want to help me
with something, Jimmy?

07:33.834 --> 07:34.667
James.

07:34.750 --> 07:35.959
Oh. James, James,

07:36.041 --> 07:37.834
James, James, James,
James, James.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.375
Seven times. Locked in.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.500
Come on.
You prefer James?

07:40.583 --> 07:41.542
Shh.

07:41.625 --> 07:42.625
I feel terrible.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.083
I see you.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.333
`I'll be back, and we'll do
the real tickling, okay?

07:46.417 --> 07:47.583
Okay.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.959
(sighs)

07:50.041 --> 07:53.083
Pretty wild stuff.
Old flame's back in town.

07:53.166 --> 07:54.875
I guess we're gonna get
that soap opera after all.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.417
Hardly.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.000
Oh, come on, I'm so bored.
Give me the details.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.000
Uh, who dumped who?
Was the sex insane?

08:01.083 --> 08:03.000
Did it just, like,
get too crazy?

08:03.083 --> 08:05.417
Aren't you supposed to be
making the cranberry sauce?

08:05.458 --> 08:06.750
Yeah, it's in the oven.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.750
The cranberries
are in the oven?

08:08.834 --> 08:10.542
No.

08:13.542 --> 08:15.625
Freshly cut
firewood, anyone?

08:15.709 --> 08:18.458
Nice. Let me get
a sniff of that.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.083
That hits me
in all kinds of good places.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.417
Yeah.
(chuckles)

08:22.500 --> 08:24.417
I brought some, too.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.041
"Take a drag." Like...

08:27.125 --> 08:29.041
(gasps)
Oh, that is so good.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.041
Yeah, right? Mmm.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.875
(Gerald, Bruce and Sara
inhaling, moaning)

08:33.000 --> 08:36.750
Look, I like sniffin' logs just
as much as the next guy, but...

08:36.792 --> 08:38.125
how'd you like to watch
some Turkey Day football

08:38.208 --> 08:39.834
with your old man, huh?

08:39.959 --> 08:42.041
I've always wanted
to hear those words.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.041
I'm gonna go lay out.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.458
You're a football
guy, James?

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
(scoffs)
You kidding?

08:46.583 --> 08:47.667
I'm practically
Gisele's husband.

08:47.750 --> 08:48.792
Oh, yeah?

08:48.875 --> 08:50.041
Okay. Well, you
know there's only

08:50.125 --> 08:52.125
one thing better
than<i> watching </i>football.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.875
What do you say?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.792
I say let's do this.

08:57.875 --> 08:58.792
Yeah!
Yeah!

08:58.875 --> 09:00.041
(laughter)

09:00.125 --> 09:01.125
I'll put the wood down.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.583
Let's play some ball, huh?

09:04.667 --> 09:06.166
(groans)
Here we go.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.750
Blue, 42. Blue, 42.

09:09.834 --> 09:10.792
Hut!

09:10.875 --> 09:12.083
(Sara yells)

09:12.166 --> 09:13.166
Oh...

09:15.458 --> 09:16.709
(ball splashes)

09:18.208 --> 09:19.125
SARA:
Huh.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.000
So should we just...

09:21.083 --> 09:22.166
go back inside?

09:22.250 --> 09:23.709
Yeah, let's call it.

09:23.792 --> 09:24.583
I'm a little chilly.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.583
Yeah.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.709
Yeah.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.417
(chuckles)

09:30.500 --> 09:32.583
You looked
pretty good out there!

09:32.667 --> 09:34.125
Yeah, right?

09:34.208 --> 09:35.583
I know.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.041
catch this guy.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.208
Okay.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.625
(line ringing)

09:39.709 --> 09:42.041
(ringtone playing)

09:44.166 --> 09:46.041
Make it quick, Jimmy.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.875
I need you
to go shopping for me.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.250
You have every shirt.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.125
No. For my family.

09:51.208 --> 09:53.166
There's this guy here
who basically raised Gerald,

09:53.250 --> 09:55.458
and-and he's, like,
this wood-chopping,

09:55.542 --> 09:57.166
belly-farting super dad.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.208
Every time I see him, I get this
weird feeling in my stomach,

10:00.291 --> 10:03.166
like, this hot ball
that's-that's poking me

10:03.250 --> 10:05.500
with-with these long,
tickly little fingers.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.125
Are you trying
to describe jealousy?

10:07.208 --> 10:08.583
(scoffs)
Please. I don't get jealous.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.125
I just want to bring some joy

10:10.208 --> 10:11.875
into my family's day,
that's all, by having

10:12.000 --> 10:14.041
my assistant go out
and get some last-minute gifts.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.125
I'm on vacation.
We need to have boundaries.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.125
I'll buy you whatever you want.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.458
A 70-inch curved TV with 4K UHD?

10:19.542 --> 10:21.125
Done.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.625
No.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.125
(phone beeps)

10:24.166 --> 10:26.250
Well, I don't need
to be here anymore.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.709
Happy Black Friday, suckers!

10:31.792 --> 10:34.208
I'm about to join
the curve revolution!

10:34.291 --> 10:36.166
MAN:
Get out of here!

10:36.250 --> 10:39.625
Oh, I like this--
real pants on Thanksgiving.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.542
Oh, come on,
don't make fun of me.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.166
You used to love my sweats.

10:43.250 --> 10:46.166
Oh, yeah. No, I loved them,
but I also love these.

10:46.250 --> 10:49.166
Okay, what about the year when I
wore your old basketball shorts?

10:49.250 --> 10:50.500
Those were the best.

10:50.542 --> 10:52.166
(laughs)
So you're just a guy

10:52.250 --> 10:53.750
who likes everything.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.208
No. Wrong.
You're just a girl

10:55.291 --> 10:56.750
who looks good
in everything.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.166
Flirt.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.250
(sighs)
(laughs)

11:01.250 --> 11:03.166
Damn, that was hot.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.166
Huh?
Thanksgiving
just got horny.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.000
Wha...? No, you're just bored.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.458
Or insane.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.208
Your chemistry
is insane.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.417
Let me guess-- he's a
Leo, you're a Scorpio?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.250
He's a Cancer,
I'm a Virgo.
No.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.208
So how long were
you two a thing?

11:16.291 --> 11:17.834
(groans)

11:17.875 --> 11:19.458
For, like, a year.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.959
And since then,
we've just been friends.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.709
Except when we got
back together for three years.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.458
Twice.

11:26.542 --> 11:29.750
Whoa. So it's kind of a
huge deal that he's back.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.125
No. It's...

11:32.166 --> 11:33.583
I mean...

11:33.667 --> 11:35.250
(sighs)
Okay, it's a li...

11:35.333 --> 11:36.750
Oh, why am I talking

11:36.834 --> 11:38.542
about this with you?

11:38.625 --> 11:40.166
It's gobble gobble
gift time.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.291
Everyone, outside!

11:41.375 --> 11:43.750
Gifts on Thanksgiving?
Is that even a thing?

11:43.834 --> 11:45.208
Of course.
Didn't you ever wonder

11:45.250 --> 11:46.583
why "giving" is
in the title, huh?

11:46.667 --> 11:49.125
No. 'Cause it comes
after the word "thanks."

11:49.166 --> 11:51.250
Yeah, well,
you'll be<i> giving </i>methanks

11:51.333 --> 11:52.709
after you see this.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.250
Wordplay.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.291
Barely.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.709
Come on, guys, trust me,
this is great.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.542
Gerald, come on.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.000
Oh, hey.
Hmm?

12:01.083 --> 12:03.125
You're gonna want
to see this.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.875
Oh, I am. I love surprises.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.250
I'll bet you do.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.834
I do.

12:07.959 --> 12:10.500
Sure. I love big ones.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.834
I'm glad somebody told you that,
'cause it's true.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.083
Yeah?
Yeah.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.250
Follow me.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.625
Okay.

12:20.166 --> 12:23.208
Come on. I want
to show you something.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.250
Wait. Uh, should we
wake her up?

12:25.291 --> 12:26.959
JIMMY: No. She knows
what she's doing.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.208
So she likes
weird tan lines?

12:28.291 --> 12:30.083
Can we stay
on task here?
I...

12:30.166 --> 12:32.000
Come on, Gerald.
Now, I know you want

12:32.083 --> 12:34.291
this Thanksgiving to be special,
but that's not possible

12:34.375 --> 12:37.250
without a special
Thanksgiving turkey fryer!

12:38.417 --> 12:39.333
A 50-quart
aluminum ridge pot

12:39.417 --> 12:40.834
with a steamer basket?

12:40.875 --> 12:42.709
Mm-hmm.
This is real life?

12:42.792 --> 12:44.125
I fired it up
while you guys were inside,

12:44.208 --> 12:45.291
so she's ready to go.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.000
Thanks, Dad!
That's so thoughtful.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.542
You're welcome, son.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.208
(chuckles)

12:50.291 --> 12:51.834
Hey, while we're still
in the gift-giving mood,

12:51.959 --> 12:54.417
does anybody mind if
I contribute a little something?

12:54.500 --> 12:56.291
Well, we're sort of past
that portion of the day...

12:56.375 --> 12:58.291
You know, when Gerald
was just a little guy,

12:58.375 --> 13:00.250
like, about seven
or eight years old,

13:00.333 --> 13:01.792
we went camping
in Big Bear.

13:01.875 --> 13:05.208
And one night, over hobo stew,
we got to talking about trees

13:05.291 --> 13:07.083
and the metaphor
of growth.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.083
GERALD: Yeah.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.417
"Our arms are
like branches--

13:10.500 --> 13:12.000
always reaching."

13:12.083 --> 13:14.250
BRUCE:
Exactly. Yeah.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.625
So we planted
a birch tree that night,

13:16.709 --> 13:19.333
just as a silly way to track
the passage of time, you know.

13:19.417 --> 13:21.083
Yeah.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.333
I found out our little Birchy...

13:23.417 --> 13:25.333
Birchy! It's what
we called it, right?

13:25.417 --> 13:27.291
Birchy? That's stupid.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.709
BRUCE:
Well, Birchy had become

13:28.792 --> 13:30.625
a full-grown tree.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.542
So, I harvested its bark

13:33.625 --> 13:35.709
and I made you...

13:35.792 --> 13:37.417
...a canoe.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.792
(gasps)

13:40.542 --> 13:41.959
Bruce, I...

13:42.041 --> 13:44.083
I don't know what to say.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.291
I do. H-He killed
your childhood tree, the guy.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.291
All right, come on, guys.
Let's get back to turkey time.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.667
Come on! Turkey time!

13:49.750 --> 13:51.291
Hey, you know,
that's way too much oil.

13:51.375 --> 13:52.959
I own a restaurant, Bruce;
I think I know

13:53.041 --> 13:54.792
something about fryers.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.375
but I have actually sent rockets
the size of office buildings

13:57.458 --> 13:59.375
into orbit, so I know a
few things about oil levels.

13:59.458 --> 14:00.667
(grunts)

14:00.750 --> 14:02.375
Hey, look what you're doing!

14:02.458 --> 14:04.375
I'm fine!

14:04.458 --> 14:06.959
You've never been better? Your
pants are literally on fire!

14:07.041 --> 14:08.959
Dad!
Just let go, fancy boy.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.709
I knew you were
competing with me.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.375
I'm trying to
save you, dingus!
Dingus?

14:12.458 --> 14:13.625
Stop it! Stop it!

14:13.667 --> 14:15.041
Little spillage.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.041
Stop!
Oh!
(all scream)

14:17.125 --> 14:19.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:19.333 --> 14:21.000
Birchy! Dad...

14:21.083 --> 14:22.959
I got it.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.583
(screams)

14:25.834 --> 14:27.583
Get some, get some.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.250
At least we know
the fryer works.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.333
I'm so sorry, Gerald.
I ruined Thanksgiving.

14:38.417 --> 14:39.750
Whatever. It's just a day.

14:39.834 --> 14:42.709
No, you wanted it to be
special for Edie and for you.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.250
Thanksgiving has
unethical origins anyway.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.250
No, Gerald, it's okay
to be mad at me.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.291
It's called being mature!
Look it up!

14:48.375 --> 14:50.000
Good. Go with that.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.792
Weren't you supposed to be
in Malibu hours ago?!

14:51.875 --> 14:53.375
Did you literally stay
just to ruin everything?

14:53.458 --> 14:54.375
Because it worked!

14:54.458 --> 14:55.792
Oh, there's more?

14:55.875 --> 14:58.542
I'm starving, and I have
nothing to canoe with!

14:58.583 --> 15:02.125
No, I stayed because...

15:02.208 --> 15:04.417
I was jealous.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.709
Is that supposed
to make everything better?

15:06.792 --> 15:08.291
You admitting
you were jealous?

15:08.333 --> 15:09.333
No.

15:09.417 --> 15:12.208
I know you were jealous!

15:12.291 --> 15:14.792
Look, I know
you didn't know about me, okay,

15:14.875 --> 15:16.583
so I'm not blaming you,

15:16.667 --> 15:18.834
but when I was a kid,
I got jealous.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.166
You know, when someone's dad
would coach soccer,

15:21.250 --> 15:22.625
or-or show up
for career day,

15:22.709 --> 15:25.083
or clearly do
their science project for them.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.291
But I sucked it up.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.667
And then Bruce came along,

15:28.750 --> 15:31.542
and I had someone
that was kind of like a dad,

15:31.625 --> 15:33.291
and it was nice.

15:33.375 --> 15:34.792
You know, he even came

15:34.875 --> 15:36.834
to some of our little
Mexican takeout Thanksgivings

15:36.959 --> 15:38.458
that were a lot better
than this.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.041
I actually thought
you might like

15:40.125 --> 15:42.250
to meet the guy
who did that for me.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.041
Whatever.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.792
I'm sorry you were jealous.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.875
I just wish you handled it

15:48.000 --> 15:50.667
at least as well as I did
when I was eight.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.250
You're right.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.291
You're right. Let me
make this up to you.

15:55.375 --> 15:57.208
It's all right, Dad.
You don't have to make...

15:57.291 --> 16:00.083
No. Give me an hour, okay?
Give me an hour, please.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.875
Hey. Don't you love it

16:03.000 --> 16:05.667
that I can still
fit into your jeans?
Nope.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.792
Listen, I was thinking
it might have been a mistake

16:07.875 --> 16:10.166
for me to come here today,
so I should probably leave.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.834
Oh, no, don't go.

16:11.959 --> 16:13.208
So you want me to stay?

16:13.291 --> 16:15.333
I just mean, where
could you possibly go?

16:15.417 --> 16:17.291
You're wearing
lady jeans.
Oh.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.333
You think this is my first time
wearing lady jeans in public?

16:19.417 --> 16:22.500
Plus, my ass looks
amazing in these. Bang!

16:22.542 --> 16:24.000
It actually does.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.333
Are you flirting with me?
