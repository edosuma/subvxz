WEBVTT

00:34.990 --> 00:38.450
Yeah, yeah, fellas.
Nice to see you too,

00:44.420 --> 00:45.670
[buzz]

00:58.100 --> 00:59.680
You know, I wasn't
a hundred percent

00:59.720 --> 01:01.390
about whether
I should call you or not,

01:01.430 --> 01:04.600
considering how things didn't go
so well for me last time.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.770
Really?

01:06.810 --> 01:08.810
I thought it worked out exactly
as you planned.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.070
I mean, you're still here.

01:10.110 --> 01:12.820
Yeah. Still here.

01:12.860 --> 01:15.070
Well, after a week's stint
in the infirmary

01:15.110 --> 01:16.990
after you're little,
you know,

01:17.030 --> 01:18.320
bust through
the glass routine.

01:19.950 --> 01:23.040
Nice job, that you were able to
just hit that crack just so.

01:23.660 --> 01:25.080
Yeah. Funny, wha?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.380
I see they've made some--

01:29.790 --> 01:31.130
solid improvements.

01:31.170 --> 01:33.010
Well, we do live in an age
of heightened security.

01:34.090 --> 01:35.630
Crocker, not to go
straight at it,

01:35.670 --> 01:37.340
but what the hell
do you want from me?

01:39.390 --> 01:42.470
First off, I'd like to call
a truce between you and me.

01:42.510 --> 01:43.930
If by truce,
you mean that

01:43.970 --> 01:46.190
we never have to lay eyes
on each other again,

01:46.230 --> 01:46.900
I'm all for that, so--

01:48.060 --> 01:50.020
Enjoy your time
in the communal showers.

01:50.060 --> 01:53.400
Secondly, I would like Tinny,
my daughter,

01:53.440 --> 01:54.940
to be allowed
to make her own decisions.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.610
And that means
no interference from you,

01:56.650 --> 01:57.910
or from your sister.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.240
Fine.

02:00.950 --> 02:02.410
Fine?

02:02.450 --> 02:04.080
Wild.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.290
I would have thought
that would warrant

02:05.330 --> 02:06.960
some kind of objection
from you.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.830
Unlike you,

02:08.870 --> 02:11.540
Tinny's a grown up.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.800
And I trust her
to make her own decisions.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.460
Well, good.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.050
We're done here.

02:17.090 --> 02:19.220
No hard feelings, and you have
yourself a good life, partner.

02:19.260 --> 02:20.890
Just wait a second,
if you'll allow me.

02:20.930 --> 02:22.510
Just one last thing.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.020
I wanna make myself perfectly
clear to you.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.560
I don't care what everybody else
says, or what they think.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.520
Remember,
know exactly who you are.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.230
And what you're
fully capable of.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.150
This, again.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.110
Everybody seems so convinced
that I murdered that hooker.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.700
And nobody seems to care
that I did not-- underscore--

02:44.740 --> 02:47.910
did not murder that hooker.

02:47.950 --> 02:51.120
Right. Well, I'd love to sit
here and keep playing

02:51.170 --> 02:53.460
Guess What
the Psychopath is Thinking,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.880
but I got real things to do
in the real world, so--

02:55.920 --> 02:58.840
I don't want my daughter
thinking I'm a murderer.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.640
Maybe you should have
thought of that

03:02.680 --> 03:04.930
before you started
acting all--

03:04.970 --> 03:06.850
Murder-y.

03:06.890 --> 03:09.520
Ha, ha! Aha!

03:12.020 --> 03:15.480
Is this visit one of a conjugal
nature between you two?

03:15.520 --> 03:17.030
Maurice Becker.
Nice to see you.

03:17.070 --> 03:19.440
Hope you're enjoying the extra
ten years that was tacked on

03:19.490 --> 03:21.530
for that whole conspiracy,
trying to off me thing.

03:21.570 --> 03:23.120
[Becker]
As to that,

03:23.160 --> 03:28.000
I've been cooking up something
really special for you, Doyle.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.370
Like I promised.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.580
And--

03:30.620 --> 03:32.710
it's on its way.
Right about now.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.670
Are you feeling it yet?

03:40.840 --> 03:41.760
All done?

03:41.800 --> 03:43.430
Yup.

03:43.470 --> 03:44.890
Nice Work.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.140
Have a good one.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.420
[explosion]

04:17.630 --> 04:19.170
[Jake]
What the hell is this?

04:19.210 --> 04:21.340
How about this for revenge?

04:25.970 --> 04:26.890
Not bad!

04:26.930 --> 04:28.890
Wouldn't you say?

04:28.930 --> 04:31.770
B'ys are you gonna try
and stop that, or what?

04:34.100 --> 04:35.350
You're coming with me.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.900
I think I'm gonna
take my chances, right here.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.070
Wrong choice.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.030
I think our chat's over,
partner.

04:44.070 --> 04:47.070
You fellas enjoy your time
on the outside.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.530
I'll find you.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.120
And you'll spend the rest of
your lives back in here.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.080
Trust me.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.540
No sir.
You took my freedom.

04:55.580 --> 04:57.710
And I'm gonna take
what you love most.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.380
And it'll break your heart.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.380
I'll be in touch!

[reporter] It was mayhem

05:35.750 --> 05:37.620
at Her Majesty's
Penitentiary today,

05:37.670 --> 05:40.090
when and explosion
in the prison's outer wall

05:40.130 --> 05:42.210
allowed a daring mass escape.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.130
At this time,
it's estimated that

05:44.170 --> 05:46.300
nearly one hundred
incarcerated criminals

05:46.340 --> 05:47.510
have been set free.

05:47.550 --> 05:49.970
And are on the run
in St. John's.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.560
So.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.220
You just happened to be
at the penitentiary

05:53.260 --> 05:55.770
for the biggest prison breakout
in provincial history?

05:55.810 --> 05:58.440
Leslie, I had nothing to do
with it, okay? It was Becker.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.070
Plus--
He's made a new friend.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.940
Kevin Crocker?

06:02.980 --> 06:04.280
You think they were working
on this together?

06:04.320 --> 06:05.190
Planned this?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.400
Well,
they escaped together.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.530
I'm pretty sure Becker
would have killed me

06:07.570 --> 06:08.910
right then and there,
if he could have.

06:08.950 --> 06:11.280
We did catch Becker on
tape trying to kill you.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.660
And we know how Crocker
feels about you.

06:13.700 --> 06:14.580
This could be revenge.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.540
Becker said he was
gonna come after

06:17.580 --> 06:19.370
the people
closest to me.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.040
Jake. It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna catch him.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.500
Both of them.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.010
And when we do, they're never
gonna see daylight again.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.720
I bet this whole thing
is kind of making

06:27.760 --> 06:30.890
the job offer in Ottawa
a lot more appealing.

06:30.930 --> 06:33.140
I don't want to think
about that.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.310
My only concern
is you.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.810
And cleaning up
Becker's mess.

06:35.850 --> 06:36.810
We can talk about
that later.

06:36.850 --> 06:38.440
Okay. Okay.
Just tell me.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.400
Is your new home
gonna be surrounded

06:39.440 --> 06:40.600
by the Atlantic Ocean?

06:40.650 --> 06:43.400
Or will it have a river
running through it

06:43.440 --> 06:45.480
that people skate on
in the winter?

06:45.530 --> 06:46.690
Well, that--

06:47.490 --> 06:48.610
sort of depends on you.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.120
Criminals are running
all over town.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.240
I'm not sure how,
but I'm guessing

06:54.280 --> 06:55.910
this is all
thanks to Jake here.

06:55.950 --> 06:58.750
Anything to give you a little
bit of exercise, buddy.

06:58.790 --> 07:00.460
Let's go round them up.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.630
We'll talk later.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.840
Man, there are some lot of crazy
dudes out there.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.430
It's like Halloween
on George Street.

07:13.470 --> 07:16.100
Except,
without all the sexy nurses.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.100
Because male cons--
No matter how you look at it--

07:18.140 --> 07:20.140
They're just not as sexy.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.690
Hey. Did the cops identify
the construction worker

07:22.730 --> 07:24.400
who set off the explosives
at the pen?

07:24.440 --> 07:26.940
No, apparently she hid her face
from the surveillance cameras.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.610
That's something
we gotta look into.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.780
She actually picked the perfect
place for that explosion.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.570
Not only did she blow off
the door.

07:32.610 --> 07:33.700
She also knocked out the power

07:33.740 --> 07:35.660
controlling all
the prison cell locks.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.290
Smart girl.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.700
Man,

07:37.740 --> 07:38.750
that's some mess of convicts
running around out there.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.160
Yeah.
And you know what?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.000
You actually helped put a bunch
of the behind bars.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.540
And if I was them,
you'd be my number one target.

07:44.590 --> 07:45.960
Like, I'd find you.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.590
And I'd get you.
And then I'd make you hurt --

07:48.630 --> 07:50.420
the same way you made me hurt--

07:50.470 --> 07:52.300
or them hurt, collectively.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.640
Actually, if they were smart,
they would just team up--

07:54.680 --> 07:55.600
Like Becker and Crocker.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.310
[Rose]
Des.

07:57.350 --> 07:58.060
It's okay Rose.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.470
What Des doesn't realize,

07:59.520 --> 08:01.230
is that he helped put
a lot of these cons away too.

08:01.270 --> 08:02.730
And if I was them,
I mean--

08:02.770 --> 08:04.440
I'd go after Des.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.690
Pick out the weakest
of the pack, kind of thing.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.230
Oh my dear Lord,
you're right.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.360
This was left downstairs
a couple of minutes ago.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.530
It's from Maurice Becker.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.740
He doesn't waste any time.

08:18.830 --> 08:21.000
Tinny's at the house.
I was just heading there.

08:21.830 --> 08:22.790
This is a warning.

08:22.830 --> 08:23.960
Tinny.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.380
She's his revenge.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.540
Tell Kathleen not to let Tinny
out of her sight.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.000
We're on our way.

08:29.050 --> 08:29.960
Understood.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.170
Hey, hey! Be careful.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.760
Okay mom.
I'll see you later.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.140
Hey.

08:40.180 --> 08:42.230
Why don't you take a sick day,
and, um--

08:43.230 --> 08:44.640
Yeah, you've been
working so hard.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.730
We could hang out.
Maybe do something cool.

08:46.770 --> 08:49.570
Maybe we could go zip lining
at Petty Harbor.

08:49.610 --> 08:52.030
Uh, you know that there's dozens
of cons on the streets.

08:52.070 --> 08:53.610
I gotta to go in.
I gotta do my job.

08:53.650 --> 08:54.990
I know. I just--

08:55.030 --> 08:57.030
Okay.
You're acting really weird.

Hey.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.870
[Kathleen]
Hey.

09:02.870 --> 09:06.330
[Tinny]
What's going on? Guys?

09:06.380 --> 09:07.460
Okay.
It seems all clear.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.290
Good.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.500
Someone wanna tell me
what's on the go here?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.800
It's Maurice Becker.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.340
He escaped from prison today.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.630
I know.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.340
B'ys, I'm a cop.
Remember?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.180
There was a ceremony.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.390
We think he's after you.
He's gonna use you to get to me.

09:20.430 --> 09:22.060
It's always about you,
Jake, b'y.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.480
This is serious,
Tinny.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.770
I'm sure it is.

09:24.810 --> 09:28.150
But, I can handle myself.
Everybody just relax.

09:28.190 --> 09:30.190
And--
There's something else.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.480
[Jake]
We think that your--

09:31.530 --> 09:34.030
father,
Kevin Crocker,

09:34.070 --> 09:35.360
is working with him.

09:41.660 --> 09:44.250
Civilized again.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.910
Clothes do make the man.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.130
[Crocker] Yeah. I can't say
I'm gonna miss the onesie.

09:49.170 --> 09:51.750
Now what the hell
are we doing here?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.630
You must have
some sort of a plan

09:53.670 --> 09:55.340
floating around
in that skull of yours.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.970
Yeah,
but just because we were

09:57.010 --> 09:58.180
on the same side of the wall,

09:58.220 --> 10:01.180
does not make us
kindred spirits yet.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.970
It was not a part of
my daily plan this morning,

10:03.020 --> 10:03.930
to escape from prison.

10:03.970 --> 10:04.890
You did that.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.020
You got me into this mess.

10:06.060 --> 10:06.980
What do you expect?

10:07.020 --> 10:08.060
Gratitude.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.270
Heh, heh.

10:09.310 --> 10:11.230
You are now a free man,

10:11.270 --> 10:13.190
and it's because of me.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.490
And I just happen
to need your assistance

10:15.530 --> 10:17.490
with some work
that needs to be done.

10:17.530 --> 10:19.780
My assistance?
Meaning, what?

10:19.820 --> 10:23.080
Meaning I pull off the job?
You reap the rewards?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.700
When you see what's at stake,

10:24.740 --> 10:27.710
that attitude of yours
is gonna change direction.

10:27.750 --> 10:28.670
What's that supposed to mean?

10:28.710 --> 10:29.880
I don't know.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.170
You do as I say,
or I'll kill your daughter.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.760
There's no debate.
No discussion.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.130
Do what I want.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.840
And she won't have to join hands
with her uncle Jake,

10:39.890 --> 10:41.220
where he is going.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.350
[Jake] We're gonna need to
know your routine today.

10:45.390 --> 10:46.430
Everywhere you're gonna be.
Okay?

10:46.470 --> 10:47.350
You're gonna need
constant protection.

10:47.390 --> 10:48.690
[Tinny]
It doesn't matter if

10:48.730 --> 10:50.560
Becker is out there,
or Crocker, or someone else.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.110
I'm a police officer.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.360
Like you both once were.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.940
There are risks.
It's part of the job.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.150
These are unfair odds.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.150
This isn't your fight.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.570
[Tinny]
Meaning you don't think

11:00.610 --> 11:01.700
I can handle myself.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.780
[Jake]
No. Tinny. I mean,

11:03.830 --> 11:07.080
I'm the one
who brought this into our lives.

11:07.120 --> 11:07.790
It's my fault.
Not yours.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.540
Tinny, we know that
you can handle yourself.

11:11.580 --> 11:12.790
But the police have
their hands full.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.000
Just let them help you.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.300
I don't know what I'll be at!

11:16.340 --> 11:18.050
I just got called in
to do my job, and I'm late.

11:18.090 --> 11:18.970
So--

11:20.010 --> 11:21.590
Let's stay close behind her.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.260
I have to go to open the bar,

11:23.300 --> 11:25.060
before one of those escapees
breaks down the door

11:25.100 --> 11:26.010
looking
for some free beer.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.930
-[ring]
-Just watch yourself.

11:27.980 --> 11:28.850
Yeah.

11:29.390 --> 11:31.400
[ring]

11:31.440 --> 11:32.350
It's Rose.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.440
What do you got?

11:33.480 --> 11:34.480
[Rose] A friend of mine on the force

11:34.520 --> 11:35.610
sent me a preliminary
fin finding

11:35.650 --> 11:37.320
of the explosive
used at the pen.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.400
C4.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.490
C4.
Where the hell did they get C4?

11:40.530 --> 11:42.240
Remember that stolen
mining shipment?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.620
Disappeared a few weeks ago.
It was in the news.

11:43.660 --> 11:44.660
Yeah?

11:44.700 --> 11:45.870
Cops think it was
the same material.

11:45.910 --> 11:46.910
Great.

11:46.950 --> 11:48.830
So now they're armed
with explosives.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.370
If you hear anything else,
keep us up to date.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.620
You got it.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.000
Sounds like Becker's planning
something bigger

11:53.040 --> 11:54.290
than this escape.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.960
And no doubt Kevin Crocker
is involved.

12:01.670 --> 12:03.180
[Leslie] I got a special
assignment for you.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.050
Do you know about
our evidence locker?

12:05.090 --> 12:06.430
Only that it was pretty much
blown up last week

12:06.470 --> 12:07.560
during the hostage situation.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.810
That's the gist of it.

12:08.850 --> 12:10.810
So now we got a compromised
evidence locker,

12:10.850 --> 12:13.230
and one hundred of Her Majesty's
out of the street.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.480
Doesn't sound like
the best combo.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.150
No, it's not.
Especially considering we got

12:17.190 --> 12:19.150
millions of dollars
worth of drugs in there.

12:19.190 --> 12:20.240
What's the plan?

12:20.280 --> 12:21.610
The brass wants
the evidence moved.

12:21.650 --> 12:23.450
And today.

12:23.490 --> 12:24.740
When do we leave?

12:24.780 --> 12:25.990
I won't be able to go with you.

12:26.030 --> 12:28.240
I need to coordinate some things
from here.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.490
You'll need these.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.040
Access to the transport vault.

12:31.080 --> 12:31.580
So I'm on my own?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.080
No. You'll be --

12:33.120 --> 12:35.250
[Des] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

12:35.290 --> 12:37.460
Oh my God.
I didn't put you in there.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.630
It was Jake.
I just do what Jake says.

12:38.670 --> 12:39.760
[Leslie]
Des!

12:39.800 --> 12:40.840
Just relax.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.380
Okay.
I'm sorry about all of--

12:42.420 --> 12:43.840
Des.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.300
[Des]
Okay.

12:46.340 --> 12:49.680
-Why are you here?
-I just wanted to, um--

12:49.720 --> 12:50.720
say hello.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.180
You're worried about me too.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.140
You do know
that your criminal father

12:54.190 --> 12:55.560
and Jake's arch nemesis have,
like, teamed up.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.360
And they're, like,
on the loose.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.900
Yeah. I'm fine.

12:58.940 --> 13:01.570
Sure. Okay.

13:01.610 --> 13:03.650
Okay. I know that now.
I just--

13:03.690 --> 13:07.370
I had to see with my own eyes.
Because no one else's will do.

13:07.410 --> 13:08.830
And I'm okay.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.080
But thanks for caring.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.210
I do-- care.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.460
Tinny. I really, really do.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.550
And, this likely
isn't the time to ask this.

13:20.590 --> 13:22.510
And, well what time is,
really?

13:22.550 --> 13:23.420
I, uh --

13:24.550 --> 13:25.890
[Grayson]
Tinny Doyle.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.720
[Des]
Who's he? Who's you?

13:29.760 --> 13:31.100
[Grayson]
Uh, let's go.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.970
We gotta get ready for
the transport run. Come on.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.190
I'll be right there.

13:35.230 --> 13:36.770
Listen.
I gotta go.

13:36.810 --> 13:39.730
But seriously.
Thanks for caring. It's sweet.

13:39.770 --> 13:41.150
You're a good friend.

13:42.570 --> 13:45.650
Okay. Well, um--

13:45.700 --> 13:47.200
Just be careful out there.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.320
Buddy.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.580
-See ya.
-Yeah.

13:59.330 --> 14:00.630
[Crocker] Look. I can't help you

14:00.670 --> 14:02.590
if I don't know what the job is,
now can I?

14:02.630 --> 14:03.880
[Becker]
Fine.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.840
We're stealing something.

14:05.880 --> 14:06.970
You happy now?

14:07.010 --> 14:08.260
What do you want from me?

14:08.300 --> 14:09.470
I read your file.

14:09.510 --> 14:10.970
You're good
with security systems.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.390
You even set up a few
with the police force.

14:15.180 --> 14:17.190
What are you thinking about?

14:17.230 --> 14:18.850
Hitting the station?
And why?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.690
Something like that.

14:20.730 --> 14:22.480
Plus you'd need
a serious inside man.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.280
And I've got you.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.320
Don't gamble
with your daughter's life.

14:32.450 --> 14:33.240
[Jake]
Who's missus?

14:33.290 --> 14:34.580
Sarah Blackwell.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.790
Former prison volunteer turned
escape accomplice.

14:36.830 --> 14:38.710
Have you found a connection
with her and Becker?

14:38.750 --> 14:40.330
Yeah. There is a connection,
alright.

14:40.370 --> 14:42.380
Let's just say Becker
has a way with the ladies.

14:42.420 --> 14:44.420
She's Becker's girlfriend?

14:44.460 --> 14:46.460
She's been calling him
and visiting him every day

14:46.510 --> 14:47.920
right up until the prison break.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.300
[Jake] No wonder he wanted to
get out of jail so bad.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.850
So we find her,
we find Becker.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.390
What do we have on Sarah?

14:53.430 --> 14:56.430
I left a file on her downstairs
in the bar. Be right back.

14:56.470 --> 14:58.270
This whole thing
is driving me crazy, okay?

14:58.310 --> 14:59.560
Not knowing where Becker's to.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.900
He could jump on us
at any minute.

15:00.940 --> 15:03.650
That's why we're gonna find him
before he does.

15:03.690 --> 15:06.400
And don't go blaming yourself
for all of this.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.110
For once,

15:08.070 --> 15:10.410
-it's not your fault.
-Ha. Ha.

15:10.450 --> 15:12.240
And, I'm not one to pry--

15:12.280 --> 15:13.240
But--

15:13.280 --> 15:14.700
Oh no, b'y.
I knows you're not.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.660
You wanna tell me what's going
on with you and Leslie?

15:16.700 --> 15:18.370
No.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.080
I can tell.
There's something wrong.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.080
Is she pregnant?

15:22.130 --> 15:24.290
No. She's not pregnant.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.550
I mean, I don't-- I don't think
that she's pregnant.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.050
You do know where babies
come from, right?

15:29.090 --> 15:30.550
Only what you told me,
father.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.390
So it's not exactly
a reliable source.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.350
If she's not pregnant, then.
What is it?

15:35.350 --> 15:36.560
She--

15:36.600 --> 15:38.270
She got a promotion.

15:38.310 --> 15:40.480
Good sign. You haven't totally
wrecked her career.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.980
No-- I mean it is good.
Very good.

15:42.020 --> 15:44.230
It's just that it's--

15:44.270 --> 15:45.440
It's in Ottawa.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.070
What do you think of Ottawa?

15:48.110 --> 15:50.360
I think it's not Newfoundland.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.860
You'd be with Leslie.
You're not pinned down.

15:52.910 --> 15:53.820
There's nothing
keeping you here.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.240
If you're trying
to get rid of me,

15:55.280 --> 15:57.540
I'll stay just to spite you.
Don't ever forget that.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.160
With you off the payroll,

15:59.200 --> 16:01.790
our insurance premiums
will come down considerably.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.130
Oh my God. You're like,
hilarious today.

16:04.170 --> 16:07.040
I'm serious, son.
You love her.

16:07.090 --> 16:10.510
Don't miss the opportunity
to share your life with her.

16:10.550 --> 16:12.470
It's times like this you realize
what's truly important.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.640
[reporter on TV] A crime wave

16:16.680 --> 16:19.470
continues to ravage the city,
as escaped cons

16:19.520 --> 16:21.680
have looted and robbed
numerous businesses,

16:21.730 --> 16:23.230
while others have stolen
vehicles--

16:23.270 --> 16:25.360
I brought a file on Sarah
Blackwell here this morning.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.940
I think I left it here.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.780
I can't believe
this is happening.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.190
Becker and Crocker
on the loose.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.440
Tinny in trouble.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.240
[Kathleen]
I haven't seen it.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.370
Okay ladies.

16:35.410 --> 16:37.120
I ain't here to hurt nobody.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.490
But if I have to, I will.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.450
Now hand over all your money.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.120
Don't ye be looking
at each other.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.620
I wants the cash
that's in the safe.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.630
And I want it now.

16:45.670 --> 16:46.590
[Rose]
Okay, well, first of all,

16:46.630 --> 16:48.090
we're not open yet.

16:48.130 --> 16:50.800
And secondly,
there is no cash,

16:50.840 --> 16:51.880
because we use these things

16:51.920 --> 16:52.880
called banks
to put our money in.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.680
Ha. Don't you get smart.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.010
I knows what banks are.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.300
And I hears tell ye got more

16:58.350 --> 16:59.850
than either
one of them in there.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.560
Let's find out,
shall we?

17:03.020 --> 17:03.940
Out!

17:04.640 --> 17:06.060
Move it!

17:07.310 --> 17:12.240
Now, buddy-- Maurice Becker
tells me that

17:12.280 --> 17:15.360
this safe
is full of cash!

17:15.410 --> 17:18.240
So either he's lying,
or you are.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.040
Now, how do you suppose we get
to the bottom of that?

17:21.660 --> 17:22.830
Taylor Gossard?

17:22.870 --> 17:25.870
In the flesh.

17:33.630 --> 17:34.880
[Grayson]
This should be the last of it.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.550
We should be ready to roll.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.680
[Tinny] Good. I'm starting
to loose feeling in my arms.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.600
Whatever--
With guns like this?

17:41.640 --> 17:42.850
Leave her guns alone,
Constable.

17:43.390 --> 17:44.810
Sorry, boss.

17:44.850 --> 17:47.440
I was just checking to see if
Tinny was up to the task.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.310
[Leslie]
Yeah. No doubt you were.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.900
Lock it up, Constable.

17:50.940 --> 17:52.780
Yes Sergeant.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.280
[beeping]

17:55.320 --> 17:56.570
Okay.
You're clear to go.

17:56.610 --> 17:58.660
Don't worry.
We'll get it there.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.700
This thing is like
Fort Knox on wheels.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.490
It's reinforced
with a great security system,

18:02.540 --> 18:04.830
but that is no replacement
for smart police work.

18:04.870 --> 18:06.120
So stay focused.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.580
Copy.
I'm on it.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.920
We're on it.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.380
Yes. We are.

18:12.340 --> 18:13.500
It shouldn't be too long.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.050
And we'll have all this stuff
in lock up.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.880
We don't have
a backup team for you.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.300
Cops are running around
trying to take

18:18.340 --> 18:19.970
as many cons down as possible.

18:20.010 --> 18:23.810
So keep your eyes sharp.
And do not stop for anything.

18:23.850 --> 18:24.850
Copy that.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.020
Watch this one.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.860
His cockiness can
get the better of him.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.770
Understood.

18:36.690 --> 18:39.160
There's supposed to be
cash in here.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.410
Where is it?

18:40.450 --> 18:42.330
A safe is supposed
to have money in it.

18:42.370 --> 18:43.490
Everybody knows that.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.290
Taylor--
Like we told you.

18:45.330 --> 18:46.830
We don't have any.

18:46.870 --> 18:49.580
You're gonna have to find
some way to pay me.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.500
Or I swear to God,
someone's gonna get hurt.

18:51.540 --> 18:52.750
I got fifty bucks in my wallet.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.000
And a bit of change.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.210
We got a ton of empties
out back.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.170
You can take them in
for deposit.

18:56.210 --> 18:58.170
I was told--

18:58.220 --> 19:00.840
that this safe
was overflowing with cash.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.600
Now pay up.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.760
Or so help me--

19:04.810 --> 19:05.930
[Rose]
Okay, relax.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.140
You're right.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.980
The real safe is in
back in the closet.

19:09.020 --> 19:10.520
Now see?

19:10.560 --> 19:12.060
That so hard?

19:13.020 --> 19:14.940
Wasted all this time,

19:14.980 --> 19:16.230
shagging around.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.700
Here you had the money
all along.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.740
Hurry up.

19:21.070 --> 19:22.200
Back.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.080
It's okay.
It's just right in there.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.410
Behind those barrels.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.580
Um.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.000
No!

19:32.040 --> 19:33.420
No, no, no!

19:33.460 --> 19:34.420
Not smart.

19:34.460 --> 19:35.710
Not smart!

19:35.750 --> 19:36.670
Open this door.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.510
I don't think so.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.300
Listen, um...

19:41.430 --> 19:43.220
I'm really --

19:43.260 --> 19:46.970
I'm really, really
claustrophobic. Okay. So--

19:47.010 --> 19:49.560
I'm gonna start shooting
if you don't open this door!

19:49.600 --> 19:51.480
Start shooting
and we'll call the cops.

19:52.270 --> 19:53.190
No cops.

19:53.230 --> 19:54.270
Don't go calling the cops.

19:54.310 --> 19:56.520
Listen, Rose. Rose.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.280
I'm just--

19:59.320 --> 20:01.610
I'm really freaking out here,
okay.

20:01.650 --> 20:03.360
I don't do too well
in small spaces.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.620
That's why I busted out of jail.

20:05.660 --> 20:06.580
Rose, open the door!

20:06.620 --> 20:07.540
Please?

20:07.580 --> 20:08.500
What's going on?

20:08.540 --> 20:09.450
We've got a--

20:09.500 --> 20:10.410
old friend--

20:10.460 --> 20:11.370
locked in the closet.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.750
-What?
-And he as a gun.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.040
[Gossard]
I didn't shoot it!

20:14.080 --> 20:15.000
Guess who that is?

20:15.040 --> 20:15.960
Taylor?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.300
Jake?

20:17.340 --> 20:19.550
You gonna let me out?

20:19.590 --> 20:21.720
Sounds like we got a bit of
a situation there, buddy.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.840
I don't do too good
in small spaces, man.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.600
I really don't like it in here.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.060
I just--

20:27.100 --> 20:28.180
Can you just let me out, man?

20:28.220 --> 20:29.470
[Jake]
I tell you what.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.180
I'm gonna open the door a crack,

20:31.230 --> 20:33.980
And you're gonna hand me
the gun, handle first.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.270
Then we'll see about
letting you out.

20:35.310 --> 20:37.270
Okay.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.400
Okay.

20:40.570 --> 20:41.990
[Jake]
Taylor?

20:42.030 --> 20:43.610
Taylor, you can't
lean against the door

20:43.650 --> 20:44.820
if we're trying to open it.

20:44.860 --> 20:45.820
Sorry, man.
Sorry.

20:47.870 --> 20:49.950
It's cocked.

20:49.990 --> 20:52.040
Jake! Let me out now.
You said--look.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.330
I gave you the gun.

20:53.370 --> 20:55.540
You can't leave me in here,
please.

20:55.580 --> 20:58.130
-Let him out.
-Please let me out.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.920
Arrgh.

21:04.970 --> 21:06.850
I don't do well in small spaces,
okay?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.550
What's the big deal?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.310
Everybody's got their thing,
don't they?

21:10.350 --> 21:11.930
Where's Maurice Becker?

21:11.980 --> 21:12.850
Been a wild old

21:12.890 --> 21:14.020
day, Jake.

21:14.060 --> 21:17.940
You know, jail break,
attempted robbery,

21:18.730 --> 21:19.900
getting locked in there--

21:21.230 --> 21:23.650
My head is a little bit foggy,
you know.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.900
Well.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.160
Let me clear that up for you.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.500
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:34.540 --> 21:35.920
Hey, where's you get that?

21:35.960 --> 21:38.500
[Des] My super secret contact
at the police station.

21:38.540 --> 21:39.500
And how is Tinny?

21:39.540 --> 21:40.460
She's good.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.750
She got this really annoying,

21:41.800 --> 21:43.840
good looking cop
beside her, though.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.930
And she is not happy about it,
I could tell.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.050
Did you find anything?

21:47.090 --> 21:49.930
Yeah. Tinny's partner's
name is Grayson.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.970
He's from
Grand Falls-Windsor.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.890
And apparently,
he's a really nice guy,

21:53.930 --> 21:54.930
if that's what
you're into.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.270
I meant the footage.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.150
I've been a tad distracted,
for some reason.

22:05.150 --> 22:07.110
[Rose] Wait a minute.
You see that?

22:07.150 --> 22:08.570
[Des]
Yeah, she gave him something.

22:08.610 --> 22:09.660
[Rose]
Any way you can blow this up?

22:09.700 --> 22:11.240
Maybe we can get an idea
what that is.

22:11.280 --> 22:12.490
Oh yeah.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.790
Des-- one.
Grayson-- zero.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.290
You better be right about this.

22:18.330 --> 22:22.630
Yeah.
My Sarah is on her way here now.

22:22.670 --> 22:24.090
Sarah.
Who's Sarah?

22:24.130 --> 22:26.090
She's my salvation.

22:26.130 --> 22:29.010
And our ticket to a better life.

22:29.050 --> 22:31.930
Why doesn't that
fill me with confidence?

22:32.970 --> 22:35.560
Hey. Kevin.
Honestly.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.900
I think it's time we just
started trusting each other.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.070
[siren]

22:55.410 --> 22:57.960
You are a sight for sore eyes.

23:13.970 --> 23:15.470
I don't care what you do.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.640
I'm not talking
about anything.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.270
Do your worst,
Jakie.

23:20.310 --> 23:22.310
Oh yeah?
Like lock you in a closet?

23:22.350 --> 23:23.860
He's got a fear
of confined spaces.

23:23.900 --> 23:24.820
Shut up about that, now.

23:25.610 --> 23:27.280
Where's Maurice Becker?

23:27.320 --> 23:28.440
and Kevin Crocker?

23:28.490 --> 23:30.070
[Malachy]
Are you really protecting them?

23:30.110 --> 23:32.910
You do know that they're using
you as a pawn in their game.

23:32.950 --> 23:34.200
Where are they?

23:34.240 --> 23:35.580
Yeah.
Becker would kill me.

23:35.620 --> 23:37.490
You know what,
Dad?

23:37.540 --> 23:39.960
I think that Maurice Becker
would be delighted to hear

23:40.000 --> 23:40.460
how much Taylor
has helped us.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.580
What does that mean?
I haven't even said anything?

23:43.630 --> 23:45.920
[Malachy] Yeah, if you really
examine the facts. Yeah. Sure.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.550
But Maurice Becker doesn't dig
around too much when it comes

23:48.590 --> 23:49.800
to possible rats.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.010
Jake
If he even suspects

23:51.050 --> 23:52.800
that you've helps us,
well--

23:52.840 --> 23:54.510
Well, he'll gut you.
Trust me.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.600
I know exactly how far Maurice
Becker will go, when it comes

23:56.640 --> 23:58.180
to getting revenge.

23:58.220 --> 23:59.310
You wouldn't do that.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.270
No?

24:01.310 --> 24:02.310
Say snitch.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.400
I ain't no rat.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.070
And I ain't no snitch.

24:07.110 --> 24:10.070
Say, Taylor.
Despite our differences--

24:10.110 --> 24:13.410
You really do take
a very nice photograph.

24:13.450 --> 24:15.780
Huh.
I had my eyes closed.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.490
I wouldn't worry
so much about it. I mean--

24:17.530 --> 24:19.370
Becker's only gonna be
interested in Taylor here.

24:19.410 --> 24:21.670
And just how much
he's helped us.

24:22.870 --> 24:24.580
You're all mad in the head.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.750
He'll never believe this.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.340
Oh, I'm pretty sure
he'll kill you--

24:28.380 --> 24:30.340
when he finds out
how helpful you've been.

24:30.380 --> 24:31.800
I haven't helped ye!

24:31.840 --> 24:33.630
I mean he really, really does
deserve to know.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.800
I'll tell him myself,
as soon as I see him.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.180
I won't even wait
for a natural segue. It'll be--

24:38.220 --> 24:39.310
Hey Maurice.

24:39.350 --> 24:41.350
Taylor Gossard
told us everything.

24:41.390 --> 24:44.650
No. Just--

24:44.690 --> 24:45.610
Come clean!

24:45.650 --> 24:46.650
You've no choice.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.360
I feel sorry for you.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.070
There's something wrong
with him.

24:52.110 --> 24:53.490
I thought my old man
was messed up.

24:53.530 --> 24:54.910
Yeah, yeah.
He's got issues.

24:54.950 --> 24:57.030
Now tell us everything.

24:57.070 --> 24:59.700
Becker gave me a little tip.

24:59.740 --> 25:03.830
Said the Duke's safe was
full of some serious cash.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.710
And you believed him.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.670
He said it would be a good way
of getting back at you --

25:07.710 --> 25:09.630
Getting back what you owes me.

25:09.670 --> 25:10.550
[ring]

25:12.670 --> 25:13.590
Hey, Rose.

25:13.630 --> 25:15.260
Hey, Mal. Listen.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.720
Des was able to blow up some of
the footage of the break out.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.220
It turns out that Sarah--

25:19.260 --> 25:20.180
Becker's girlfriend?

25:20.220 --> 25:21.140
Yeah.

25:21.180 --> 25:22.560
She handed Becker a key fob.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.310
It's not good Mal.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.980
Des saw one like it today.
Tinny had it.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.190
What?
What's it for?

25:28.230 --> 25:31.190
Wha? Oh.
It's something. I'm not sure.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.440
It's something pretty high tech,
for sure.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.490
Off topic.

25:33.530 --> 25:35.990
Are cops attracted
to other cops?

25:36.030 --> 25:37.490
Because I always thought
it was a standard P.I.

25:37.530 --> 25:39.030
and cop connection.

25:39.070 --> 25:39.870
You know,
like Jake and Leslie.

25:39.910 --> 25:41.080
But Jake was a cop.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.830
But then he was a P.I.
when he met Leslie.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.790
-Thoughts.
-Did you check Tinny's phone?

25:44.830 --> 25:46.170
No. There's no answer.

25:46.210 --> 25:47.460
This isn't good.
Thanks.

25:47.500 --> 25:47.540
I'll call you back.

25:49.250 --> 25:52.300
Becker's hitting something that
involves Tinny and a key fob.

25:52.340 --> 25:53.510
Could be anything.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.510
Hey.
Bell head.

25:56.550 --> 25:57.970
What else do you know?

25:58.010 --> 26:00.140
Just Becker said,
if you showed up,

26:00.180 --> 26:01.850
I could have the pleasure
of taking you down.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.190
We played right
into Becker's hands.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.230
He was using Taylor
as a distraction.

26:09.270 --> 26:10.230
What?

26:10.270 --> 26:11.230
Wait.

26:11.270 --> 26:14.690
I was a diversion?
Man, I'm getting

26:14.740 --> 26:16.650
pretty sick of being played
all the time.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.490
Yeah,
but you're so good at it.

26:18.950 --> 26:21.120
[ring]

26:21.160 --> 26:22.240
Sergeant Bennett.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.240
Leslie, it's me.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.330
Make it quick.
I'm a bit busy.

26:25.370 --> 26:26.540
I know. I'm sorry.

26:26.580 --> 26:27.500
Where's Tinny?

26:27.540 --> 26:28.460
Working.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.830
What's this about?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.290
We think that Crocker and Becker

26:31.340 --> 26:33.210
are involved
in some kind of heist

26:33.250 --> 26:34.880
And it's got something to do
with a key fob.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.630
Does that make
any sense to you?

26:36.670 --> 26:38.720
Oh no.
The transport.

26:38.760 --> 26:39.640
What are you talking about?

26:39.680 --> 26:40.890
We're moving the evidence

26:40.930 --> 26:43.310
from our locker to the RNC vault
in Mount Pearl.

26:43.350 --> 26:44.600
What vehicle are you using?

26:44.640 --> 26:46.600
Are you using those old
transport tank things?

26:46.640 --> 26:47.730
Yeah.
How did you know that?

26:48.940 --> 26:52.190
No wonder.
No wonder Becker needed Crocker.

26:52.230 --> 26:53.570
He designed all the security
features for everyone

26:53.610 --> 26:55.150
of those transport vehicles.

26:55.190 --> 26:55.860
Great.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.110
Okay. Look.

26:57.150 --> 26:58.400
You gotta tell it to turn
around. Right away.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.990
I'll try.

27:00.030 --> 27:01.660
And let them know that Becker
and Crocker are coming for it.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.660
I'm on it.

27:04.870 --> 27:06.910
We gotta catch up
with that transport.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.540
What about our little friend?

27:08.580 --> 27:09.790
You could just let me go.

27:09.830 --> 27:10.920
I mean at this point,

27:10.960 --> 27:11.960
I'm pretty
much the third wheel.

27:13.420 --> 27:15.960
I promise I'll check right into
police headquarters.

27:16.590 --> 27:17.670
Cross me heart.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.050
He's coming with us.

27:34.940 --> 27:36.980
-[Tinny] What are you doing?
-[Grayson] What do you mean?

27:37.030 --> 27:38.190
[Tinny]
Why are we stopping here?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.030
[Grayson] I'm stopping
to see what's wrong.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.990
We were told
to stop for nothing.

27:43.030 --> 27:44.240
I don't think they thought
we'd come across

27:44.280 --> 27:45.700
EMT's in need of help.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.160
That's exactly what they meant
when they said nothing.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.290
Well, it's my call, rookie,
not yours.

27:50.330 --> 27:51.670
Relax.

27:51.710 --> 27:53.500
Okay. It will be fine.
Just watch my back,

27:54.710 --> 27:57.170
which I know
you were sizing up earlier.

27:57.210 --> 27:58.670
This is a bad idea Grayson.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.840
Please.

28:01.050 --> 28:02.720
Is there a problem?
You need some help?

28:02.760 --> 28:03.970
[Sarah]
I think it's my engine.

28:04.010 --> 28:05.970
Got a passenger in really
bad shape in there.

28:06.010 --> 28:07.930
Oh God.
Where are you parked?

28:07.970 --> 28:09.270
-Back in there.
-In the hanger?

28:09.310 --> 28:11.140
-Yeah.
-What's wrong with the pass--?

28:26.370 --> 28:26.740
[dispatcher] Transport. Do you read me?

28:27.870 --> 28:30.160
Come in Grayson?
Constable Doyle.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.500
Too late.

28:41.510 --> 28:42.380
What the?

29:05.110 --> 29:07.280
Yeah. There you are.

29:18.130 --> 29:19.380
Alright.

29:19.800 --> 29:20.670
[beep]

29:21.960 --> 29:24.630
We'll shut you down.

29:25.380 --> 29:29.220
So you cannot go home.

29:33.930 --> 29:35.900
-[beep]
-Perfect.

29:45.610 --> 29:47.780
There it is.
Beautiful.

29:47.820 --> 29:48.950
[Crocker]
Yeah.

29:48.990 --> 29:51.330
This could set a fella up,
huh?

29:52.450 --> 29:54.210
Did you do what you were
supposed to?

29:54.250 --> 29:55.420
Do I look like an idiot?

29:56.750 --> 29:58.960
I disabled the security system
and the alarm.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.340
So, as far as anyone
is concerned,

30:00.380 --> 30:02.050
this vehicle is still travelling
towards it's target.

30:02.090 --> 30:03.630
Any problems?

30:03.670 --> 30:05.050
It was very tricky.

30:05.090 --> 30:06.010
Trust me.

30:06.050 --> 30:06.970
I only had fifteen seconds

30:07.010 --> 30:08.640
to spare.
But, hey--

30:08.680 --> 30:10.640
I designed the system.
I knew it's weaknesses.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.010
And the officers?

30:12.060 --> 30:13.640
Just one kid.
Sarah took care of him.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.810
Atta girl.

30:14.850 --> 30:16.770
Well, load up the ambulance.

30:16.810 --> 30:18.150
I'll be right behind you.

30:25.190 --> 30:25.950
[Tinny]
Hands where I can see 'em.

30:27.150 --> 30:28.450
Tinny, what the hell
are you doing here?

30:28.490 --> 30:29.070
Just drop what you're holding.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.370
I'm arresting you.

30:30.410 --> 30:31.490
Hold on Tinny.
This is not what it looks like.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.780
Save it.

30:32.830 --> 30:34.540
We both knew it might
come to this, and it has.

30:34.580 --> 30:35.660
I have to arrest you.
Just--

30:35.700 --> 30:37.160
-Do it quietly.
-You don't understand.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.460
No I'm pretty sure I do.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.000
Drop the bags.
Put your hands up.

30:46.130 --> 30:47.930
-Tinny!
-[bang]

30:49.680 --> 30:51.100
Bye, bye, Pretty.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.560
[tires squealing]

30:54.600 --> 30:55.810
Son of a--

30:57.100 --> 30:57.980
[bang]

31:02.060 --> 31:02.980
Dad.

31:03.020 --> 31:03.940
[bang]

31:03.980 --> 31:04.900
[bang]

31:04.940 --> 31:06.070
You miss me Jake!?

31:06.110 --> 31:06.990
[bang]

31:07.490 --> 31:08.200
[bang]

31:08.610 --> 31:09.160
[bang]

31:09.610 --> 31:11.070
[banging]

31:11.110 --> 31:14.080
This is therapeutic, Doyle.
You should try it sometime.

31:14.120 --> 31:14.990
[bang]

31:15.040 --> 31:16.080
Good idea!

31:16.120 --> 31:17.410
Why don't you
toss me over your gun.

31:17.460 --> 31:18.370
[banging]

31:18.410 --> 31:19.620
Or not!

31:19.670 --> 31:21.960
Stop taunting him.
It's all bad enough!

31:22.000 --> 31:23.250
[Gossard]
Hey--

31:23.290 --> 31:24.250
You think you could let me go?

31:24.290 --> 31:25.340
I'm kinda getting shot at here.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.510
We probably shouldn't
let him die.

31:26.550 --> 31:28.510
Yeah,
we'd hate to rid the world

31:28.550 --> 31:30.970
of this charming
crack dealing arsehole.

31:31.010 --> 31:31.890
[bang]

31:32.760 --> 31:33.680
Get outta here.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.640
[bang]

31:34.680 --> 31:35.760
This ain't over.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.430
Me and you.
We still got business.

31:37.470 --> 31:39.560
Less talkie talkie--
More runnie, runnie.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.100
[bang]

31:41.150 --> 31:42.610
Now, what, hotshot?

31:42.650 --> 31:43.860
Well, we got these.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.570
Might as well
make use of them, wha?

31:45.610 --> 31:46.480
[bang]

31:47.650 --> 31:48.570
[Rose] I hate to say it,

31:48.610 --> 31:50.450
but Becker's plan
is brilliant.

31:50.490 --> 31:51.570
If he and Crocker
pull off this heist,

31:51.610 --> 31:52.950
they'll have millions
in drugs

31:52.990 --> 31:54.330
and a load of other valuables.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.330
Come on, come on.
Pick up.

31:56.370 --> 31:57.370
Des, you okay?

31:57.410 --> 31:58.410
No. She's not picking up.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.370
I've called Tinny like,
ten times.

31:59.410 --> 32:00.580
And she's not picking up.

32:00.620 --> 32:02.250
Okay, but that doesn't mean
anything, honey.

32:02.290 --> 32:04.420
Like, she doesn't usually pick
up her phone when she's at work.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.460
-I should have done something.
-What are you talking about?

32:06.500 --> 32:07.500
You cracked the clue
on that tape.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.670
That was huge for us.

32:08.710 --> 32:10.630
No. I could have done more.
Instead of--

32:10.670 --> 32:12.640
Instead of leaving her
with Grayson.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.050
Is that even a real name?

32:14.090 --> 32:15.640
He can't protect her!

32:15.680 --> 32:16.600
Des.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.640
Calm.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.850
How do you do it?

32:21.890 --> 32:24.020
-Do what?
-Be calm.

32:24.060 --> 32:26.440
When everyone keeps putting
their life in danger.

32:27.730 --> 32:30.030
You trust that
they're good at what they do.

32:30.070 --> 32:31.860
Just as I trust that you know
what you're doing

32:31.900 --> 32:33.660
when you're out there.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.280
Now, go on.
Give your quasi-girlfriend

32:35.320 --> 32:36.240
another call.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.830
What? Us? Girlfriends?

32:37.870 --> 32:39.330
I mean, boyfriends?

32:39.370 --> 32:40.660
I mean, dating?
I mean--

32:40.700 --> 32:42.620
I'm just gonna dial now.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.340
[bang]

32:48.300 --> 32:50.880
[banging]

32:52.380 --> 32:55.390
[sirens]

32:56.970 --> 32:58.600
Come on. Come on.

32:59.060 --> 32:59.970
Anything?

33:00.020 --> 33:01.390
No. There's no answer.

33:01.430 --> 33:02.640
This doesn't look good.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.140
Have we got any cars closer
on the way?

33:04.190 --> 33:05.480
Sadly, we're it for now.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.190
You know the situation.

33:07.230 --> 33:09.360
If Crocker and Becker
are there already, God knows

33:09.400 --> 33:10.740
what's happened.

33:13.740 --> 33:14.860
[Becker] Are you enjoying the show, son?

33:14.910 --> 33:15.990
We should go.

33:16.030 --> 33:17.200
The cops are gonna
be here any second.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.240
We're not going anywhere
until we empty that

33:18.280 --> 33:19.910
transport into the ambulance.

33:19.950 --> 33:21.700
And you remember your kid.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.370
I got a far reach.
And my hands

33:23.410 --> 33:26.330
don't have to do it.
I got people everywhere.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.960
Here we go.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.090
[Becker]
What the hell is this?

33:33.840 --> 33:35.340
Aha!

33:35.380 --> 33:37.350
I don't need eyes to kill you,
Doyle!

33:37.390 --> 33:38.600
[banging]

33:38.640 --> 33:41.640
I've been visualizing
this for a long time.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.810
[banging]

33:44.270 --> 33:45.190
Ah!

33:45.230 --> 33:47.100
I was worried about you.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.190
Someone hit me.

33:48.230 --> 33:49.980
One of the Doyles.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.400
-I'm sure it was.
-Maurice!

33:51.440 --> 33:53.070
Get into the ambulance.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.400
This is not the end of it.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.740
Looks that way to me.

33:56.780 --> 33:57.910
[punch]

33:59.320 --> 34:02.080
Okay. Malachy.
I sincerely apologize here.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.250
But it's gonna be
best for all of us

34:03.290 --> 34:04.580
if we just play along.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.130
Go ahead.
Do it! Off him!

34:11.800 --> 34:12.920
[punch]

34:12.960 --> 34:15.170
I was trying to fix everything!

34:16.840 --> 34:18.090
[Jake]
Dad!

34:18.140 --> 34:20.010
Come on. Get up!
Get up!

34:21.680 --> 34:23.060
I'm coming after you!

34:23.100 --> 34:24.100
I don't think so, Pal.

34:24.140 --> 34:25.270
[tires screech]

34:25.310 --> 34:27.190
Hey! Becker.
Becker! Becker!

34:27.230 --> 34:28.560
So long, Crocker.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.940
See you by and by.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.610
Becker!

34:32.610 --> 34:33.570
[Jake]
I got Crocker!

34:54.050 --> 34:56.050
Don't worry.
We'll be okay.

34:57.090 --> 34:57.970
Is it bad?

34:59.390 --> 35:01.180
Oh, you'll be fine.

35:01.220 --> 35:02.760
You'll be fine, my love.

35:08.270 --> 35:10.480
[Becker]
We always are.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.930
Lord, dy'in.

35:49.020 --> 35:52.520
Sarah.
How are you doing, my love?

35:58.030 --> 36:01.070
These Doyles are like mice.

36:01.110 --> 36:04.990
You see one, there's a hundred
more hidden in the trees.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.410
[buzz]

36:18.760 --> 36:20.420
She's still not answering.

36:26.970 --> 36:29.810
Wait.
She just sent me a text.

36:29.850 --> 36:30.810
Is she okay?

36:30.850 --> 36:31.770
Grayson's not with her,
is he?

36:31.810 --> 36:33.520
No. She's fine.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.730
Um. Oh damn.
Okay.

36:35.770 --> 36:37.400
She's in an ambulance
with Becker.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.400
It's his getaway vehicle
and she's gonna make a move.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.820
What? No!
That's a very bad idea. She-

36:42.990 --> 36:45.070
Okay. I thought you meant
with Grayson.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.780
No, wait.
That's still a very bad idea.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.080
Yeah, I know.
I'm texting her.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.370
Okay.
We gotta call Mal.

36:51.290 --> 36:52.290
[ring]

37:05.930 --> 37:07.140
Hey, partner!

37:12.230 --> 37:13.270
If I didn't know any better,

37:13.310 --> 37:15.610
I'd say
you didn't want to face me.

37:18.110 --> 37:21.360
[tires screech]

37:21.400 --> 37:24.240
[phone rings]

37:24.280 --> 37:25.530
Rose?
I'll have to call you back.

37:25.570 --> 37:26.530
I'm in the middle of something.

37:26.570 --> 37:27.870
Malachy,
this is important.

37:27.910 --> 37:29.950
I'm on a high speed chase
with Maurice Becker,

37:29.990 --> 37:31.950
who's driving an ambulance.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.330
I know.
Tinny's inside.

37:33.370 --> 37:34.290
What?

37:34.330 --> 37:36.080
She's gonna try
and stop Becker.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.260
[crash]

37:43.300 --> 37:45.260
[horn honks]

37:46.720 --> 37:47.760
Malachy?

37:49.930 --> 37:51.310
Mal?

37:53.480 --> 37:55.520
One down.
Ninety nine to go.

37:57.310 --> 37:58.360
Police.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.480
Stop the vehicle.
You're under arrest.

38:01.190 --> 38:04.070
I said stop the vehicle and put
you hands where I can see them.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.080
Hey.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.370
Katrina.

38:13.410 --> 38:17.080
Did you really think it was
gonna be this easy?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.960
[sound of gun cocking]

38:23.380 --> 38:24.670
Huh?

38:26.380 --> 38:30.430
[horn blares]

38:44.900 --> 38:45.860
[Rose] Mal?

38:47.360 --> 38:48.700
Malachy,
why aren't you answering?

38:48.740 --> 38:50.700
Okay. Okay.
He probably--

38:50.740 --> 38:52.490
He probably
just dropped his phone.

38:52.530 --> 38:53.450
Or something.

38:53.490 --> 38:56.080
-He'll be okay.
-Yeah. Yeah.

39:08.630 --> 39:11.140
Well! You got me!
You cannot--

39:11.180 --> 39:14.260
outrun a man with such
determination in his mind.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.560
What can I say?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.680
You filled me with inspiration.

39:17.730 --> 39:18.640
Let's finish this.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.730
Yeah.

39:19.770 --> 39:21.520
Yeah. It's been
a long time coming.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.360
And now, Jake.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.570
I am gonna have
to kill you.

39:25.610 --> 39:28.110
There's the murderer
that I know and hate.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.330
So.
This is it, huh?

39:38.370 --> 39:39.830
It all comes down to this,
doesn't it?

39:39.870 --> 39:41.210
You want to take a moment?

39:41.250 --> 39:42.750
Enjoy the view before
I throw you off?

39:42.790 --> 39:43.840
Come on.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.090
We all know how
it's gonna end up.

39:45.130 --> 39:46.170
With me on top.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.380
Because
I always fight dirtier.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.720
And I'll do
anything to win.

39:49.760 --> 39:52.390
See, I knew he was in there.
That crooked cop.

39:52.430 --> 39:55.060
I don't remember us having
this communication problem

39:55.100 --> 39:56.100
when we were partners.

39:56.140 --> 39:57.020
Where the hell
did we go so wrong?

39:57.060 --> 39:58.060
Oh, I don't know.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.270
Maybe when you killed
that missus.

39:59.310 --> 40:00.770
Or when you kidnapped
the little girl,

40:00.810 --> 40:02.310
who turned out to be your kid.

40:02.350 --> 40:04.270
Jakie, Jake, Jake.

40:04.310 --> 40:06.020
You're so trapped in the past.

40:06.070 --> 40:06.940
[punch]

40:08.940 --> 40:11.820
Just let me go.

40:11.860 --> 40:12.870
If you surrender--

40:12.910 --> 40:14.490
Surrender?

40:14.530 --> 40:15.700
Is that what you said?

40:15.740 --> 40:18.660
Surrender?
No, no. No, sweetie.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.660
That's not gonna happen.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.420
What about your friend?

40:22.460 --> 40:24.210
Don't worry about me,
baby.

40:25.790 --> 40:27.250
You're insane.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.010
Huh?

40:29.050 --> 40:32.260
I warned your uncle
and your grandfather

40:32.300 --> 40:36.260
to stay out of my business.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.720
They pushed me to this.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.230
I warned them.

40:40.270 --> 40:42.480
But they kept coming.

40:42.520 --> 40:43.690
They're gonna stop you.

40:43.730 --> 40:45.400
You're not gonna get away
from here.

40:45.440 --> 40:49.400
You'd think that,
wouldn't you? Yes.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.740
Your grandfather had a bit of
an accident in the car.

40:53.860 --> 40:57.700
Now how good a driver are you?

40:58.490 --> 40:59.370
[punch]

41:00.580 --> 41:01.700
[punch]

41:01.750 --> 41:04.040
I'm not going back to jail,
Jake.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.670
You're gonna have to kill me.

41:05.710 --> 41:06.630
Suit yourself.

41:06.670 --> 41:07.550
[punch]

41:08.590 --> 41:09.460
[punch]

41:18.220 --> 41:20.020
You leave me no choice,
partner.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.390
Sorry,
this is the end.

41:30.030 --> 41:31.320
You gonna kill me?

41:33.860 --> 41:35.410
You don't kill me--

41:35.450 --> 41:36.660
I'm gonna kill you!

41:38.330 --> 41:40.580
[siren]

41:40.620 --> 41:41.910
[Becker]
Ha, ha!

41:42.580 --> 41:43.580
No sir!

41:43.620 --> 41:45.960
Not a bad plan at all.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.300
Arrgh.

41:55.510 --> 41:56.970
Let go!

42:09.860 --> 42:10.730
Crocker.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.940
Kevin.

42:12.990 --> 42:13.860
Crocker.

42:26.000 --> 42:26.870
Oh my God.

42:28.380 --> 42:29.380
What have I done?
