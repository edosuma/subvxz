09:58.639 --> 10:00.308
live like
the rich and the famous!

10:00.308 --> 10:01.851
But when the finale
rolls around,

10:01.851 --> 10:03.061
you're gonna lose.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.312
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:04.312 --> 10:05.564
Wait a second here.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.315
You want me to throw
the competition?

10:07.315 --> 10:08.900
Let me spell it out
for you.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.069
You're gonna butcher
the song

10:11.069 --> 10:13.113
like you do at the Bark Easy
every night.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.656
Like you know anything
about winning, Cyclops.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.493
I know what
you're gonna say.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.204
You should see the other guy.
Grr.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.581
You gotta be kidding me.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.458
You're telling me
you wouldn't want to know

10:24.458 --> 10:26.709
what it feels like
to be adored by millions,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.920
sleep in
five-star hotel rooms,

10:28.920 --> 10:32.215
order room service and get
pampered like a Pomeranian?

10:32.215 --> 10:33.508
Let me think...

10:33.508 --> 10:34.884
No.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.553
Other than
her taste in music,

10:36.553 --> 10:38.597
I've got nothin'
against Tiny.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.059
Ha, ha!
Let her sleep on it.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.604

Yup.

How does it feel to be the most
beloved <i> Pup Star</i> champion ever?

16:20.939 --> 16:24.484
It feels amazing. I appreciate
all the support from my fans.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.527
I couldn't have
done this alone.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.863
Do you think you can top
last years' performance?

16:28.863 --> 16:32.074
I'll try my best, but there are
so many talented pups

after you ruined my life?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.430
You won't get away with this.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.851
My family and friends will
find me, and you'll go to jail.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.814
Please,
don't waste your breath.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.317
No one will come
looking for you this time.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.235
They'll just forget
about you and move on,

22:41.235 --> 22:45.323
just like every other
one-hit wonder out there.

22:45.323 --> 22:48.575
You've gotta be kidding me!
You're gonna leave me here?

22:48.575 --> 22:52.997
No, wait! Don't leave, please!
Let me go!

22:52.997 --> 22:55.624
And don't even think
about escaping.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.294
I built that cage
with my own two hands.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.088
Like Fort Knox. Ha, ha.

23:11.682 --> 23:14.352

the queen of pop...

23:25.279 --> 23:26.530
Tiny!

23:29.283 --> 23:31.618
This was a bad idea.

23:33.453 --> 23:36.414
Now, it's a very bad idea.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.669
Sing!

23:40.669 --> 23:43.130

for the effervescent Tiny

25:55.595 --> 25:58.057
different take
on her hit song,

25:58.057 --> 25:59.475
"Is This For Real?"

26:05.272 --> 26:09.776
Girl, what inspired you
to burst out into a rap verse?

26:09.776 --> 26:12.446
Guess it was in there
waiting to bust out.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.864
Surprise!

26:13.864 --> 26:16.158
Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Now can somebody

26:16.158 --> 26:18.035
prop up
my ear flaps, because...

26:18.035 --> 26:19.745
rap and pop,
now they--

26:19.745 --> 26:21.872
They go together like
blues and hip-hop.

26:21.872 --> 26:24.791
There's an old Jamaican
proverb, Tiny.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.378
It say, "Hang ya leash
where you can reach it."

26:27.378 --> 26:30.339
No, no, no. I'm gonna call
a spaniel a spaniel.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.174
That was dreadful.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.093
And, no, no, no, listen.
And not-- No.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.262
And not at all
what we expect

26:36.262 --> 26:38.847
from a defending
<i>Pup Star</i> champion.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.598
Like you would know, poser.

26:40.598 --> 26:41.975
Whoa.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.186
I am speechless.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.604
I mean, thank you
for the critique!

26:49.358 --> 26:50.776
Tiny!

26:50.776 --> 26:52.610
Aw.

26:52.610 --> 26:55.406
I missed you so much.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.657
I, uh, I missed you too?

26:57.657 --> 26:59.452
Are you okay?

26:59.452 --> 27:00.702
Yeah, yeah.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.913
I'm just not used
to all this PDA.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.499
Wassup, pops?

27:05.499 --> 27:07.876
Uh... Ah...

27:07.876 --> 27:09.627
You're obviously
sick as a dog.

27:09.627 --> 27:10.921
Why didn't you tell me?

27:10.921 --> 27:12.298
Like you care, buster.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.717
Of course I do!

27:15.717 --> 27:17.386
Ugh! We'll schedule in
some naps,

27:17.386 --> 27:19.472
a eucalyptus steam,
and a trip to the vet.

27:19.472 --> 27:21.307
Um, Shep,
you got a sec?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.016
Hm.
I...

27:23.016 --> 27:25.769
think Tiny needs some
family time to recuperate.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.645
What about her schedule?

27:27.645 --> 27:29.064
We missed five
interviews today

27:29.064 --> 27:30.941
because of that
skunk fiasco!

27:30.941 --> 27:32.818
We're gonna go to Chicago
for a little while,

27:32.818 --> 27:34.153
so put that
in her schedule.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.488
Okay.

27:36.614 --> 27:37.781
Hey honey, let's go.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.367
Okay. Come on, Tiny.
Let's go home!

27:40.367 --> 27:41.743
Let's go.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.290
I can't wait
to get you home.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.041
Come on, girls.
Let's get back to Chicago.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.754
They bought it. She's in.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.047
<i>By a whisker.</i>

27:54.047 --> 27:55.966
You keep an eye
on her tonight.

27:55.966 --> 27:57.926
Make sure she
doesn't get cold paws.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.054
<i>...songwriter hopeful,</i>
<i>guaranteeing them...</i>

28:01.054 --> 28:02.640
Brr!

28:02.640 --> 28:05.100
It's really cold in here.

28:12.566 --> 28:15.486
How's my family
ever gonna find me?

28:29.833 --> 28:33.462
Wakey, wakey.
Kibble with no bakey.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.881
Holy Houdini!

28:35.881 --> 28:38.008
This is my chance!

28:42.513 --> 28:44.264
Come here!

28:52.105 --> 28:55.442
Get off of me!
Get it off of me!

28:56.818 --> 28:58.070
Coming through!

28:58.070 --> 28:59.821
- Coming through!
- Whoa!

28:59.821 --> 29:02.533
Aah! Unh!

29:02.533 --> 29:05.327
How did humans ever
get to rule the world?

29:05.327 --> 29:06.828
Whoa, that was close!

29:06.828 --> 29:08.997
Here, puppy, puppy!
I won't hurt you, I promise!

29:15.462 --> 29:17.797
Get off me, get off of me!

29:25.639 --> 29:28.100
Dognapper alert!
Somebody help!

29:34.106 --> 29:36.233
I'm so lost.

29:36.233 --> 29:40.529
My family, well, they have to be
looking for me by now.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.810
Oh, hello there, cat.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.061
What are you doing

30:13.061 --> 30:14.563
cutting through
cat alley again,

30:14.563 --> 30:15.897
Scrappy?

30:15.897 --> 30:17.566
Funny.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.736
but that's not
my name, actually.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.197
And I-I'm sorry,

30:24.197 --> 30:25.616
I didn't know!

30:25.616 --> 30:27.284
Sure, you didn't.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.375
I got a bone to pick with you.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.836
You're making me fur-ious.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.255
Hi, there...felines.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.591
There certainly is
a lot of you guys.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.344
You know the rules.
You cut through our alley,

30:45.344 --> 30:46.886
you pay the toll.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.806
The-- The toll?

30:48.806 --> 30:51.266
But I don't have
anything to give you.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.186
What about that shiny thing
around your neck?

30:55.437 --> 30:57.230
That's the locket
my mom gave me.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.525
We can do this
the easy way

30:59.525 --> 31:03.111
or my purr-ferred way...

31:03.111 --> 31:04.530
The hard way.

31:09.827 --> 31:13.079
I should, um, make
like a banana and split!

31:14.080 --> 31:15.624
Get that pup.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.000
Let's get him, girls.

31:18.752 --> 31:21.672

31:24.341 --> 31:27.636

What's going on?

31:29.596 --> 31:31.306
Again with the Scrappy.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.518
Well if it isn't
Ms. Catty Purry.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.353
Just here
to collect my debt.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.605
Scrappy took the shortcut
through Cat Alley.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.857
You know the rules.

31:39.857 --> 31:42.568
How about you let
sleeping dogs lie.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.277
You best move on.

31:44.277 --> 31:46.988
This ain't no cat fight.
You can't win this battle.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.074
I'm not done with you, Scrappy!

31:49.074 --> 31:51.243
I always collect my debts.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.745
- We make 'em pay.
- Right.

31:52.745 --> 31:55.539
One scrap at a time,
if need be.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.708
Let's get outta here.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.501
What'd you do this time,
Scraps?

31:59.501 --> 32:01.920
Um, I wouldn't
give her my locket.

34:54.384 --> 34:57.178
Sweet dreams, girls.
Good night, daddy.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.222
I love you.
I love you.

34:59.222 --> 35:02.517
Catch you
on the flip side, pops.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.978
Okay?

35:12.986 --> 35:16.782
Tiny, I'm sorry we weren't able
to see each other more.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.411
I can tell
it's been hard on you.

35:21.411 --> 35:24.831
But that's
all gonna change now.

35:24.831 --> 35:28.668
I'm not going anywhere,
and I...

35:34.299 --> 35:36.927
Good night, Tiny.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.226
Ready to turn in, Scraps?

35:45.226 --> 35:47.938
Sure.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.522
I'm exhausted.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.242
We can share
my bunk tonight.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.375
Hop on up, I won't bite.

36:15.048 --> 36:16.299
Good night guys.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.384
Don't let
the flea bugs bite.

36:27.727 --> 36:31.481
Morning. Here's your breakfast.
Thank you.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.525
Yo, I call first dibs on that!

36:33.525 --> 36:34.860
You can have it.

36:39.156 --> 36:41.491
I guess Tiny really hungry
today, huh?

36:41.491 --> 36:43.201
Clearly.
Mm.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.703
Okay.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.004
Up and at 'em!

36:54.004 --> 36:55.922
I slept like a puppy.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.678
Wassup, Scraps,
it's the crack of noon.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.763
You workin' on your
beauty sleep or somethin'?

37:03.763 --> 37:06.808
It's been a busy schedule
of engagements.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.434
A schedule of engagements?

37:08.434 --> 37:10.353
You really are
talkin' crazy.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.604
Enough talkin'.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.148
Let's get something
in our tummies!

37:13.148 --> 37:15.817
Let's
hit it.

37:15.817 --> 37:19.278

- Real grass?

37:19.278 --> 37:20.989

She's happy to be home.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.035

37:25.035 --> 37:29.581
No asphalt? I love the feeling
of dirt underneath my paws.

38:08.245 --> 38:11.456
Funny, Scraps.
It's called a "tag."
Hey.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.083
You want a touch-up
on those streaks?

38:13.083 --> 38:16.002
Streaks?
Okay, I guess so...

38:31.851 --> 38:33.311

38:34.938 --> 38:36.982

Heh-heh-heh.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.109
But this green ice cream
looks bangin'.

38:41.527 --> 38:43.321

39:03.842 --> 39:05.384

she's been possessed.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.428
My aunt Maria had a priest
perform an exorcism

39:07.428 --> 39:08.680

47:19.003 --> 47:20.254
That was just business.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.507
Look,
you scratch our back,

47:22.507 --> 47:23.716
we'll scratch yours.

47:23.716 --> 47:25.551
Ha-ha-ha!

47:25.551 --> 47:29.263
I can already scratch
my own back. Unlike dogs.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.140
Or humans,
for that matter.

47:32.684 --> 47:35.019
You're telling me
there's nothing that you want?

47:35.019 --> 47:36.312
Hmm.

47:36.312 --> 47:38.356
Well, I want the cats
to be able to go

47:38.356 --> 47:41.275
to the Bark Easy
just like any human or dog can.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.402
Catty Purry
gets to sing...

47:43.402 --> 47:45.237
And I want
equal billing.

47:45.237 --> 47:49.325
Heh-heh-heh.
Equal billing for cats?

47:49.325 --> 47:51.868
Ha! Bark would never
agree to that--

47:51.868 --> 47:54.246
Zip it! Anything else?

47:54.246 --> 47:56.915
Yeah, we want a table reserved
just for cats.

47:56.915 --> 47:59.251
And pitchers of milk
on the house.

47:59.251 --> 48:01.003
Okay. You got a deal.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.797
Hmm.

48:02.797 --> 48:04.674
She's hanging out
with The Dawg Pound crew

48:04.674 --> 48:05.924
by the bridge.

48:05.924 --> 48:07.677
Bingo!

48:07.677 --> 48:09.136
What do you want?

48:09.136 --> 48:11.305
I'm not scared of you.
Huh!

48:11.305 --> 48:13.974
I'm shaking in my paws.
Huh.

48:16.185 --> 48:17.770
Where you going so fast?

48:17.770 --> 48:19.188
What's the hurry?

48:22.859 --> 48:24.068
Mama.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.831
We thought you could use
a little ventilation.

48:36.831 --> 48:39.876
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha!

48:39.876 --> 48:42.378
You're an embarrassment
to the human race.

48:47.592 --> 48:50.511
Hey Scraps,
we got somethin' for ya.

48:50.511 --> 48:51.970
What is it?

48:51.970 --> 48:54.557
Come on inside
and see for yourself.

49:00.772 --> 49:04.650
Wow. Oh, my goodness.
For me?

49:04.650 --> 49:05.942
I know
you're a solo artist,

49:05.942 --> 49:08.780
fiercely independent
and all that, but...

49:08.780 --> 49:10.615
I thought you might wanna
stick around.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.200
You know, be a part
of our crew.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.620
You earned some props,
Shorty.

49:15.620 --> 49:19.164
Thank you so much,
from the bottom of my heart.

49:19.164 --> 49:22.710
But I have something
to tell you.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.044
Why don't you sleep on it?

49:24.044 --> 49:25.922
We can talk about it
in the morning.

49:25.922 --> 49:29.258
Uh, okay. Sure.

49:33.137 --> 49:36.515
Sweet dreams, guys.

49:36.515 --> 49:38.350
Yeah, right back at ya.

49:38.350 --> 49:40.937
Uh, sure Scraps,
same to you.

49:42.979 --> 49:46.818
Happy birthday, Tiny!

49:46.818 --> 49:48.985
Oh, uh...

49:48.985 --> 49:50.947
Hey, guys!

49:50.947 --> 49:52.156
Here we go.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.908
Nice!

49:53.908 --> 49:55.785
What's goin' on here?

49:55.785 --> 49:58.245
Tiny,
it's your birthday.

49:58.245 --> 49:59.580
For reals?

49:59.580 --> 50:01.624
Well, it's not
your actual birthday.

50:01.624 --> 50:03.793
We celebrate the day
when I brought you home.

50:03.793 --> 50:06.002
I never had
a birthday before...

50:06.963 --> 50:09.465
I mean, not like this.

50:09.465 --> 50:12.343
Well, go on.
Blow out your candles!

50:12.343 --> 50:16.221
Oh, uh, okay...
You first.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.563
Wow, this is, uh...

50:24.563 --> 50:27.608
Confetti cake.
Your favorite, Miss Tiny.

50:27.608 --> 50:29.777
And vegan this year.

50:34.114 --> 50:38.034
It's, uh...different.

50:38.034 --> 50:41.079
I mean, it's the thought
that counts, right?

50:42.832 --> 50:46.168
This is the best day
of my life!

50:46.168 --> 50:47.712
Tiny!

50:49.505 --> 50:50.798
Oh!

50:52.132 --> 50:54.969

I knew that cat
was lying.

51:31.923 --> 51:34.800
Note to self.
Never trust a cat.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.218
Look out for the--

51:38.930 --> 51:40.848
Intruder alert.

51:43.141 --> 51:45.352
So much for the element
of surprise.

51:47.688 --> 51:50.315
Yo, it's Roland and Kano
from the Bark Easy.

51:50.315 --> 51:51.984
They were the ones
chasin' us before?

51:51.984 --> 51:53.819
What'd you do this time,
Scraps?

51:53.819 --> 51:56.030
It's a long story,
but trust me,

51:56.030 --> 51:58.240
we have to get out
of here now.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.617
Set the booby trap.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.250
Humans first.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.335
Ah-ha.

52:17.133 --> 52:18.886
Here's Roland!

52:22.264 --> 52:23.766
Pull the escape hatch!

52:29.229 --> 52:30.522
Follow me, guys!

52:36.821 --> 52:38.572
Great.
They're getting away!

52:38.572 --> 52:42.118
My eyes, my eyes!
Oh, it burns!

52:42.118 --> 52:44.244
I can't see.
I need water!

52:44.244 --> 52:47.331
I need water!
Help me!

52:54.672 --> 52:57.758
I can see.
It's a miracle!

52:57.758 --> 52:59.969
Don't say,
I never do anything for you.

53:01.303 --> 53:04.473
Hey, why does this water
smell like pee?

53:04.473 --> 53:06.266
Torch the place.

53:23.199 --> 53:25.828
You can run,
but you can't hide for long!

53:36.630 --> 53:38.298
That's our crib,
yo.

53:38.298 --> 53:39.717
Where we gonna go?

53:39.717 --> 53:41.510
This is all
my fault.

53:41.510 --> 53:43.012
What's goin' on,
Scraps?

53:43.012 --> 53:44.304
What'd you do?

53:44.304 --> 53:46.306
You need to come clean
with us.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.809
Well, I, um...

53:48.809 --> 53:50.853
I'm actually
not Scrappy.

53:50.853 --> 53:52.730
My name is Tiny.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.815
- What?
- Say what?

53:54.815 --> 53:57.401
<i>The</i> Tiny, from <i> Pup Star?</i>

53:57.401 --> 54:00.278
Seriously, how could you lie
to us like that, Scrap?

54:00.278 --> 54:03.074
Or Tiny, or...
whoever you are.

54:03.074 --> 54:05.492
I wanted
to tell you,

54:05.492 --> 54:08.079
but I just couldn't seem
to find the right words.

54:08.079 --> 54:11.373
How about, "Yo, I ain't Scrappy,
the name's Tiny."

54:11.373 --> 54:12.750
Simple like that.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.044
I guess
I've just been confused.

54:15.044 --> 54:18.463
Being famous is weird.

54:18.463 --> 54:22.885
I never see my family,
especially my girl, Lou.

54:22.885 --> 54:24.469
And everyone else...

54:24.469 --> 54:28.306
well, you don't know
who really likes you

54:28.306 --> 54:30.809
just...for you.

54:30.809 --> 54:34.146
I guess I got caught up
in you guys liking me for me.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.774
Yeah, but <i> you</i>
isn't really you.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.734
We thought
you were Scrappy.

54:38.734 --> 54:40.778
You're not real at all!

54:40.778 --> 54:42.571
You're right.

54:42.571 --> 54:44.322
I'm a fake.

54:45.074 --> 54:46.408
I should leave now.

55:47.886 --> 55:50.181
- P.U.P.? Ruff?
- M.C. Bite?

55:50.181 --> 55:52.141
What are
you guys doing here?

55:52.141 --> 55:53.391
We realized somethin'.

55:53.391 --> 55:55.351
You didn't do this
on purpose.

55:55.351 --> 55:57.729
You were dognapped
and escaped.

55:57.729 --> 56:02.860
Besides, we do love-- Like
you for who you are inside.

56:02.860 --> 56:04.862
Yeah, P.U.P. is right.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.404
You ain't half bad.

56:06.404 --> 56:08.448
We have to find out what
happened to Scrappy.

56:08.448 --> 56:10.117
She could be
in big trouble!

56:10.117 --> 56:12.953
The Dawg Pound crew
never runs from a battle.

56:12.953 --> 56:15.039
We need to confront
the situation head-on.

56:15.039 --> 56:16.372
Follow me.

56:21.003 --> 56:24.965
<i>It's time for:</i>

I don't see Tiny.

56:45.236 --> 56:47.905
She's on Car Drool Karaoke.

56:47.905 --> 56:51.075
Oh, my God--
That's Scrappy, you nimrod.

56:51.075 --> 56:52.576
The real Tiny.

56:52.576 --> 56:53.827
You were out trying
to find her

56:53.827 --> 56:55.453
after you let her escape,
remember?

56:55.453 --> 56:56.747
Oh, right.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.665
It's going to take
a little more time.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.626
She's got accomplices now,
the Dawg Pound crew.

57:01.626 --> 57:03.045

57:41.666 --> 57:44.002
Scrappy better not get
any bright ideas.

57:44.002 --> 57:46.130
I'll go to Cleveland
and remind Scrappy

57:46.130 --> 57:47.672
not to blow her cover.

57:47.672 --> 57:51.093
Or worse, forget to throw
the <i> Pup Star</i> finale.

57:51.093 --> 57:54.138
Scrappy's going to lose
<i>Pup Star</i> as me?

57:54.138 --> 57:55.306
Why?

57:55.306 --> 57:57.808
We have to leave fast.
Let's go.

were outta sight!

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.346
But this establishment
is closed.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.515
Come back at 10:00.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:45.642
We're looking for Scrappy

The only thing I see

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.316
is a couple of jive turkeys.

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:56.528
You don't mind if we look
around then, do you?

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.113
It's your trip, man.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:00:59.823
You guys
create a distraction.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.116
We got your back!

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.784

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.470

See you later, suckers!

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.749
They're getting away.

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.126
Let 'em go.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.545
We know where they're headed.

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:55.879

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:59.299
Yes, Roland.
<i>The Rockstar Hall of Fame.</i>

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:00.758
That was close.

01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:03.136
Those were some bad actors.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:06.973
Scrappy and P.U.P.,
this is my pal, Magic.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.892
Thanks for helping us out,
Mr. Magic.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.353
Aw, you can drop
the mister, sister.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:14.022
Makes me feel like I'm part
of the establishment.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:18.776
Hey, when Shampoo howls,
it's always a groovy time.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:23.156

road trippin' it to?

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:26.117
We need to get to the Rockstar

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:27.785
Bark's dognapped
Scrappy.

01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:29.120
She's in big trouble!

Oh, uh...Uncle Shampoo?

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.590
I have a confession to make.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:42.509
Well, the confessional's open,
Scrappy.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:45.929
That's just it...
My name is actually Tiny.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.806
I can dig it.
My name was Melvin.

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:50.267

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:54.312
It's always been Magic!
Hmph.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.690
No, no,
that's not it.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.983

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.240
Yes, the one and only.

This way, let's go!

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.086
As you can see,
we just got our paws

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:03.881

the Barks wore for Sgt. Puppers!

01:04:05.801 --> 01:04:08.345
So we got Charlie's gold album
here on our right,

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.514
right across
from Elton Bichon's piano.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:13.141
Hah, it's so crazy, man!

01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:15.727
Hey, who's that babe
hangin' with Charlie?

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:18.938
Man, that fox
is Emily Rose.

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:21.733

an old feller a nuzzle.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.860

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:38.208

And you know what?
Tiny's a good pup.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:32.447
You've forgotten
one very important detail:

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.491
They don't love <i> you,</i>

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.910

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.745
They love Tiny.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:40.747
And when they find out
what you've done,

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.332
they'll kick you
to the curb

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.709
and you'll be begging
for scraps in no time.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:46.294

I don't care
if I'm starving.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.132
Sure you do. Because
if you don't do as I say,

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:55.553
Kano might have to pay a visit
to dear little Lou.

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:57.889
And by visit, I mean--

01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:59.390
Don't you dare
hurt her!

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.643

01:07:06.982 --> 01:07:08.441
Okay, Tiny.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.902
You need to rest up
for the <i> Pup Star</i> finale.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:16.658

01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:33.466

Unless I'm havin'
a flashback,

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.452
which is
a distinct possibility,

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.705
didn't you just leave

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:05.331

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.335

in their dressing room.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:12.881

is that you, old buddy?

01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:16.216

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:24.392

01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:46.831
You've been quite
the thorn in my paw.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:50.710
And you might remember me.

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:58.593
Don't even think about doing
that Houdini routini again.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:08:59.886
Heh, heh...

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.179

01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:03.723

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.269
You mess this up, and you'll
be ground into cat food.

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:16.319
That wasn't very nice.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.035
Hm?

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.037

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.626

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.086

some bad vibrations.

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:40.093
Let them out

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:42.303

a hotel room.

Are we getting the band
back together?

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:14.711
That's not
a half-bad idea.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.047
I've been looking for
some new bandmates.

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:19.674
But for now, I need help getting
these rockers to Chicago,

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:22.635
as fast as Slash's fingers
can rock his guitar.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:25.138
Uh, the little one looks
kind of familiar.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:28.016
It's a bit of a long story,
but I'm Tiny,

01:10:28.016 --> 01:10:30.309
the defending champion
of <i> Pup Star.</i>

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.687
This is my friend P.U.P
and my uncle Shampoo.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:36.524
Ha! This Shampoo looks like
a real dogfish out of water.

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.735
He's one of them
disco dogs,

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.695
but we don't hold it
against him.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.865
Now don't be blamin' the music
'cause you got four left paws.

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:46.534
The <i> Sea Dog</i> is
at your service, friends!

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.203
You're in
good hands now, pup.

01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:50.496
You go all the way.
And you remember:

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.456
disco's a disease.

01:10:52.456 --> 01:10:54.625
Rock is the cure, man.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.252
Thank you,
Mr. Rocky!

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.713
Man...
I need a walk.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.678
Why is Scrappy
pretending to be me?

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:08.514
That doesn't sound like
the Scrappy we all know.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:11.726
Fiercely independent
and all about keeping it real.

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:13.603
Bark must have something
over her.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.188
Something terrible
is going to happen

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:18.149
if she gets on stage
tomorrow, I just know it...

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:21.360
Aw, don't worry, pup.
We'll get ya there.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.656
♪ So make a wish
And close your eyes ♪

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.868
♪ And may your wish
Come true ♪

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:31.996
♪ Tonight ♪

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:35.666

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.752

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.336
You okay?

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:41.005
Yeah...

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:45.676
I'm nervous about
the <i> Pup Star</i> finals.

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:48.930
What if I don't win?
No one will love me.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.641
We're a family.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.602
Winning or losing has
nothing to do with that.

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:56.271
You say that now,

01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:58.397
but people change
their minds

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.399
when they find out
who you really are.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:02.443
Don't worry,
Tiny.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:04.779
I'll always
love you.

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:06.906
That's what families
are for.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:09.408
We love each other,
no matter what.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:11.452
I just want you to know
that, no matter what,

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:12.870
this time with you
and the family

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.747
has meant the world
to me.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.001
Oh, Tiny,
don't worry.

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.544
I'll love you
forever.

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:22.505
I'll always love you too.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.927
All right, guys,
it's time to go to sleep.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:30.346
You have a big day tomorrow.
I love you.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.265
I love you.
I love you.

01:12:51.242 --> 01:12:54.245
You know, Tiny,
no matter what happens...

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.122
I--<i> We</i>

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.041
hope
you don't forget me--

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.250
Us.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.793
You're
kidding!

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.503
You...

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:05.464
guys mean
the world to me.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.763
Rover!

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:16.226
Rover! Over here! Rover!

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.071
- Tiny!
- Tiny!

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.656
Tiny, the reigning star
of the night is going up...

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:32.408
- Hey, Rover!
- Who's your pick

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.327
for <i> Pup Star</i> this year?
I can't pick faves,

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:36.954
but Tiny's a whole new pup
this season!

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.040
Who do you think
will win <i> Pup Star?</i>

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.125
Our money's on Tiny!
Don't you worry,

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.127
she'll pull a rabbit
out of her hat.

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:45.088
You're my role model!

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:48.424
Tiny!
There's our falling star now.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.262
Lou! Over here.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:56.266
Tiny, you're here.

01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:58.101
Lou!

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.814
Now we'll always have
a photo together.

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.942
Ooh!
Heh-heh-heh!

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:10.321
- Is the family excited?
- Are you?

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:12.907
Okay, okay,
let's wrap it up!

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.075
Yoo-hoo!

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:16.160
Over here!
Tiny!

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.121
Tiny!

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:23.334
We gotta go,
we gotta go. Come on!

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:25.128
What're you doing here?

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.004
We're here to wish you
bad luck.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:29.506
Yeah. And break a leg,
literally.

01:14:29.506 --> 01:14:31.134
I'm touched.
Really.

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:32.468
You'll get what
you want.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:33.886
I will be an outcast,

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:36.139
but no one will be
worse off than you, Bark.

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:38.182
Ha! I'll be back
on the stage

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.684
next season,
just you watch.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.630
From east to west,
north to south,

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.048
the dogs came to audition.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.801
The competition has never
been more fierce,

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:16.553
and the fans have never
been more excited.

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:19.307
Ladies and gentlemen,
pups and pupettes,

01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:21.309
the wait is finally over!

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:25.396
Welcome to the <i> Pup Star</i> finale!

01:15:28.483 --> 01:15:31.610
Here to kick off the show
are your beloved judges:

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.197
the lovely Lady Paw Paw.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.491
Holler, my little mongrels.

01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.951
The Rasta Dog Gnarly.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.745
Booyaka, booyaka,
Gnarly's on the scene.

01:15:41.745 --> 01:15:43.956
The Soulful Big Ears.

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:46.083
Yeah, baby! I'm so excited,

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:48.127
I almost forgot my blues!

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:51.547
And the incorrigible
Simon Growl.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:54.467
Dreams will be crushed tonight.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:56.552
Five finalists are gearing up

01:15:56.552 --> 01:16:00.264

Integrity means telling
the truth.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:26.619

your truth.

I'm Tiny.

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:40.341
Yeah and I'm
Arnold Schwarzedogger.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:43.678
Tiny is about to go on stage.
Nice try, pup!

01:18:43.678 --> 01:18:46.389
That's not me.
That's Scrappy.

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:48.265
Tah! Never heard of her.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:51.101
No time to explain.
It's a family emergency!

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:53.062
Run, Tiny!
Run like the wind!

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.898
You just got burned,
baby!

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.025
Hey, get back here!
What do you think you're doing?

01:18:58.025 --> 01:18:59.818
Hey, not you too!
Code red!

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:01.654
We've got a runner!
Code red!

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:05.074
Now we've come
to the point in our show

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.784
where our defending champ
from the Windy City,

01:19:07.784 --> 01:19:10.663
must mark her territory
and prove to the world

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:12.540
that she's still numero uno.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.790
Ladies and gents,

01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:15.792
pups and pupettes,
please give it up

01:19:15.792 --> 01:19:17.878
for the reigning
<i>Pup Star</i> champion...

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:19.171
Tiny!

01:19:32.727 --> 01:19:34.520
Woo-hoo!
Go get 'em, Tiny!

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.231
Yeah!
Rock on, Tiny!

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.818
Thank you, thank you.

01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:44.655
Integrity means
telling the truth.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.491
Being authentic is living
your truth.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.205
Shep, it's me, Tiny!

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.084
Oh, my dog.

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.923
Wait. Hold up.

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:05.468
Please.
I have something to say.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.970
That better be the title
of her new song.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.975
I've been trying
to gather the courage

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:14.184
to tell you all that...

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.395
I'm not actually Tiny.

01:20:19.649 --> 01:20:20.899
Oh, my goodness.

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:22.359
My name is Scrappy,

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:24.570
and I'm just a street pup
from Brooklyn.

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.698
I'm an imposter.

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:30.200
I was supposed to throw
the competition tonight.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.703
This can't be
happening!

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:34.413
Bark dognapped Tiny

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:36.290
and put me in her place.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.875
And I-- I tried
to justify doing it

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:42.630
because I never had a chance
in life, no shot.

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.006
But that's just an excuse

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.550
for not working hard
and believing in myself.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:50.846
I am sorry.
To Tiny's family.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.889
Aww...

01:20:52.889 --> 01:20:54.558
Lou...

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:58.646
I hope that one day,
you can forgive me.

01:20:58.646 --> 01:21:00.147
I might have been a fake,

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:02.733
but everything in my heart
is real.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.485
Aww...

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:07.154
She's a liar!

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:09.198
Well, isn't this
a dogs' breakfast.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.033
Time to exit
stage left.

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.871
She's telling the truth.

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:20.209
You're barkin' up
the wrong tree, fella!

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.586
You better get gone
while the gettin's good,

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.004
you jive turkey.

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:26.215
Uh, yeah,
I was just leaving.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:29.510
That's right,
keep on steppin', man.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.261
All I can say is...

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:33.138
I'm so sorry, Tiny.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:34.849
It's okay, Scrappy.

01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:37.309
Look, I found your box
at Shampoo's.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:40.855
There's a picture inside.
Of us.

01:21:40.855 --> 01:21:42.189
Us...?

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:44.483
You, me, and our mom.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:45.860
What?

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.152
Lou...

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:48.612
can you come onstage?

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.500
Can you put our lockets
together?

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:15.890
Don't you see,
Scrappy?

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.100
You're the other half
I've been missing.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.685
You mean...?

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.144
Our mom gave them to us

01:22:21.144 --> 01:22:23.522
so we would always
be able to find each other.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.775
We're sisters!

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:32.489
Their mama
would've been so proud.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.950
Hey, man, are you seeing
what I'm hearing?

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.787
What what?
You're sisters?

01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:40.122
Obviously, they're twins.
Hello?

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.998
We have a real Tiny,

01:22:41.998 --> 01:22:43.709
an imposter Tiny,

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:45.127
and they're sisters?

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:47.337
Wow!
Did you hear that?

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:50.424
The rating meter
just blew up. Boom!

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:54.720
I don't know how I could
have done this to you.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.513
I'm sorry too, Scrappy.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:23:00.183
You deserved a family too.
Maybe it's not too late!

01:23:00.183 --> 01:23:02.895
How can you ever want anything
to do with me?

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:05.188
We're better
together.

01:23:05.188 --> 01:23:08.358
All of us. As a family.

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:10.402
We love you
Tiny and Scrappy!

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:27.043
My heart meter
just blew up.

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.630
Two sisters, one love.

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:33.509
I know I'm a bluesman
and all...

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:37.429
but that was sadder than
a hound dog's eye. Oh...

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:42.184
Well, Tiny, are you ready
to defend your title?

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.727
Do it, sis.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:47.189
Wait... Can Scrappy
and I perform as a duo?

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:49.692
That's never
been done before.

01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:52.820
But there's no rule
against it.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.447
I can't do that!
What if I blow it for you?

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.867
You've gotta start
believing in yourself.

01:23:57.867 --> 01:23:59.409
Let go
of the past!

01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:02.162
Scrappy,
you have a bright future.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.914
Yeah, Scrappy!

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:06.542
We win together,
or we lose together.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.878
Either way, we're always
better together.

01:24:08.878 --> 01:24:12.297

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:13.924

It's over, nincompoop.

01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:26.395
Get us out of here before
the canine cops show up.

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:27.897
You know,

01:24:27.897 --> 01:24:30.566
I think the universe
is clearly telling us

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.402
that we are better
together.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.278
Just drive.
Yeah.

01:24:38.949 --> 01:24:42.661
Get ready to do
some hard time, Bark.

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.675

Scrappy.
