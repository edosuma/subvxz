Hey, dude, I don't remember
the password. Let me in.

00:16.432 --> 00:17.669
I think someone's following me.

00:17.702 --> 00:19.439
Who?

00:19.472 --> 00:21.176
Get in here.
It's the doc crew.

00:21.209 --> 00:22.512
[sighs]

00:23.480 --> 00:24.617
You, too. Come on.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.186
When I ran away from Nandor,

00:26.219 --> 00:27.421
I didn't really know
where to go.

00:27.454 --> 00:30.294
[Nandor]
Guillermo!

00:30.327 --> 00:33.801
[Guillermo]
So I just flew
for hours and hours.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.404
Which was a little cool because

00:35.437 --> 00:37.208
that was the longest
I've ever stayed a bat.

00:37.241 --> 00:38.511
But also not cool

00:38.544 --> 00:40.214
because I knew Nandor was trying

00:40.247 --> 00:41.651
to track me down to kill me.

00:41.684 --> 00:43.788
Eventually, I just went
to Derek because...

00:43.821 --> 00:45.124
I had no one else to turn to.

00:45.157 --> 00:47.261
I've just been laying low,

00:47.294 --> 00:49.398
hiding for who knows how long.

00:50.768 --> 00:53.407
I wish they had Bravo here.

you haven't told anyone else
that I'm here.

01:37.595 --> 01:39.499
Guillermo, who would I tell?
Literally. My neighbor Chad?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.469
Because... yes, actually,
I did tell Chad.

Yes, burgers, extra rare,
just like you asked.

01:47.682 --> 01:49.820
I tried hypnosis on the cashier
so I could get them for free.

01:49.853 --> 01:51.524
Turns out, I'm bad at it.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.396
No, and it wouldn't
matter if they did

where you were hiding.

So, that was you.

-Who did you think it was?

She told me her name
was Detective Policeman.

-[Nadja] That's funny.
-I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor, buddy.

02:28.363 --> 02:32.672
Can you go to the market and
get me some raw, raw meat

02:32.705 --> 02:34.610
and make sure you don't
tell anyone where I'm at.

02:34.643 --> 02:35.845
-Can you do that?
-Can do, can do.

02:35.878 --> 02:37.549

You simply cannot talk
to the vampire who turned you

02:46.499 --> 02:48.303
with such disrespect.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.340
That is a sacred relationship.

02:50.373 --> 02:51.844
You have to protect him.

Any progress on that end?

03:09.746 --> 03:11.817
Uh, yeah, um, a little.

-You talked to him?
-Yeah.

Maybe if I write him a letter...

03:21.537 --> 03:24.242
Yeah, like if you wrote him
a suicide note,

03:24.275 --> 03:25.879
and actually followed through
on it,

03:25.912 --> 03:28.751

has taken his last breath

crunch under my boots.

So I've been watching
the one place

04:27.769 --> 04:30.909

return to eventually...

Panera Bread.

04:33.012 --> 04:34.983
I've got you now.

04:35.016 --> 04:36.720
He can run,

04:36.753 --> 04:38.524
but he cannot run far.

04:38.557 --> 04:40.661
Because he has very short legs.

-I-I didn't do anything.

04:48.076 --> 04:51.784

the ultimate price, Guillermo.

And this disguise

04:53.152 --> 04:54.823
that has slightly altered
your appearance

04:54.856 --> 04:56.125
does not fool me.

-Yes!

What would I know you from?

05:04.910 --> 05:06.680
-I was in Ratatouille.
-Is that a movie?

05:06.713 --> 05:08.584
It's... It was animated.

05:08.617 --> 05:09.786
I was the voice of a rat.

05:09.819 --> 05:12.091
-I prefer live action.
-Uh...

05:12.124 --> 05:13.694

I know of him.

05:27.187 --> 05:29.458
You are respectful,
unlike Guillermo.

05:29.491 --> 05:30.962
I have been lying
in wait for him

05:30.995 --> 05:32.899
on the top of
that building there.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.035
It's only a matter of time

05:34.068 --> 05:36.072
before he returns
to Panera Bread,

05:36.105 --> 05:38.410
like a gazelle
to his watering hole.

05:38.443 --> 05:41.850
And when he does, I will strike.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.921
Are you sure it's
that Panera Bread?

05:43.954 --> 05:45.592
-What do you mean?
-There's a lot of Panera Breads.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.562
They're... They're all
over the city.

05:47.595 --> 05:48.630

-[Colin] Gigi?

-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

05:56.613 --> 05:58.149
-How did you find me?
-Oh, I just...

05:58.182 --> 06:01.624
took a map of Staten Island
and laid it over a grid

06:01.657 --> 06:03.159
and looked for any motel
that shared a square

06:03.192 --> 06:05.865
with an Arby's, a party store
or a sweater shop.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.736
Well, I'm not near
any of those things.

06:07.769 --> 06:09.773
Yeah, I know,
so I just asked Nadja.

06:09.806 --> 06:11.977
Great. What do you want?

06:12.010 --> 06:14.148
First off, I just want
to wish you good luck.

You're a nice enough guy
caught in a bad sitch.

06:17.187 --> 06:20.127

hoping for this outcome for you.

06:28.176 --> 06:30.748
And also your life, so...

06:30.781 --> 06:34.155
Have a seat. I don't want to
take up too much of your time,

06:34.188 --> 06:36.894
I know it's valuable. [chuckles]

06:36.927 --> 06:39.498

there's so little of it left.

06:47.047 --> 06:48.551
Um, Mr. de la "Cruzz,"

06:48.584 --> 06:51.890
what's prompting you
to leave your job?

06:51.923 --> 06:53.561
Nandor trying to kill me.

06:53.594 --> 06:56.800
And... what was your salary
as a familiar?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.537
Oh, I don't get paid.

06:58.570 --> 07:01.643
[chuckles] No, but honestly,
for this to work,

07:01.676 --> 07:03.681
I kind of need
a ballpark figure.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.183
$500, $550 a week?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.787
-I don't get paid.
-Uh-huh.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.557
And do you think
we can get away with

07:08.590 --> 07:10.528
not paying the next person?

07:10.561 --> 07:12.799
Okay. This interview's over.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.972
Interview concluded by subject

07:16.005 --> 07:19.713
who was cooperative
and at times almost articulate.

07:19.746 --> 07:21.049
-[recorder clicks]
-Okay, thank you.

07:21.082 --> 07:23.086
This is just from me.

07:23.119 --> 07:25.525
It was nice having you
in the house.

07:25.558 --> 07:26.960
Thanks, Colin.

Sales Leader, 1977."

07:30.634 --> 07:34.509
I got it at estate sale,
but y-you get the drift.

07:35.845 --> 07:37.915
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

07:39.017 --> 07:42.726
I think what bugs me the most

07:42.759 --> 07:44.896
is that I have given
Guillermo my friendship.

07:44.929 --> 07:47.836
This is a gift
I do not give to just anyone.

07:47.869 --> 07:51.543
Uh, you know, friendship
has to be... earned.

07:51.576 --> 07:53.113
How is your, um...

07:53.146 --> 07:54.616
-Turkey Bacon Bravo.
-Yes.

07:54.649 --> 07:56.018
It is, it's good.

07:56.051 --> 07:57.221
And I usually get
the bread bowls here--

07:57.254 --> 07:58.958
I think what it is

07:58.991 --> 08:02.063
is that I thought Guillermo
had earned it.

08:03.801 --> 08:06.707
You are a good listener,
Patton Oswalt.

08:06.740 --> 08:08.309
You know, it's funny
because something like this

08:08.342 --> 08:10.848
happened with me a couple years
ago with my manager, we--

08:10.881 --> 08:12.986
-Shh. Just listen.
-Oh... [grunts]

08:13.019 --> 08:15.290
We are not talking
about you right now,

08:15.323 --> 08:17.027
are we, Patton Oswalt?

08:17.060 --> 08:18.864
-No, we're not.
-Mm.

08:18.897 --> 08:21.035
-So, go on.
-Thank you.

08:22.605 --> 08:25.711
[knocking]

Who is it?

08:29.619 --> 08:31.255

08:31.288 --> 08:33.259
-I should ask how you
found out where--
-Shh, shh.

08:33.292 --> 08:34.294
What?

08:35.798 --> 08:38.002
I'm guessing you're content
with your...

08:38.035 --> 08:39.773
toilet paper situation?

08:39.806 --> 08:41.209
Yes, thank you.

08:41.242 --> 08:43.012
All right.

08:43.045 --> 08:44.749
Then I will...

08:44.782 --> 08:47.354
leave you to watch
the television for the evening.

08:47.387 --> 08:50.160
And I will say... goodbye.

08:50.193 --> 08:51.897
-[quietly] Sit down.
-What's going on?

08:51.930 --> 08:54.870
I must apologize, Gizmo,
I feel like I've let you down.

08:54.903 --> 08:56.205
All those science experiments,

08:56.238 --> 08:57.876
they were nothing
but a blind alley.

08:57.909 --> 08:59.679
Laszlo, you tried your best.

08:59.712 --> 09:01.282
No, there's been something I...

09:01.315 --> 09:02.886
You-you should probably
put something on

09:02.919 --> 09:04.288
that's a bit louder than this.

09:04.321 --> 09:06.292
Otherwise, it won't
drown our voices out.

09:06.325 --> 09:08.029
-[airplanes whirring]
-That's better.

09:08.062 --> 09:11.169
I've known you since
you were a young familiar.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.039
And I may have been hard
on you in the past,

09:13.072 --> 09:15.177
-and, uh...
-[gunfire on TV]

09:15.210 --> 09:16.780
Could you put something that...

09:16.813 --> 09:18.784
is as loud but less percussive?

09:18.817 --> 09:20.253
-[engines roaring]
-Sport, yes, that's better.

09:20.286 --> 09:22.224
And I say,
does that thing have any...

09:22.257 --> 09:24.629
programs of the adult variety?

09:25.698 --> 09:27.201
Uh, I suppose, yeah.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.706
-[giggling]
-[Laszlo gasps]
-There you go.

09:29.739 --> 09:31.944
[clears throat] You were saying?

09:31.977 --> 09:33.046
Sorry?

09:33.079 --> 09:34.315
-You were saying?
-Yes.

09:34.348 --> 09:35.918
I was saying...

09:35.951 --> 09:38.657
I've known you since you were...

09:38.690 --> 09:40.327
-a young fa...
-[moaning on TV]

09:40.360 --> 09:42.064
What do you think
they're gonna do?

09:42.097 --> 09:43.667
-Yeah, Laszlo--
-Yes, yes,

09:43.700 --> 09:46.272
s-sorry, since you
were a young familiar.

09:46.305 --> 09:48.978
And, uh, I'm about
to tell you something now

09:49.011 --> 09:50.748
that I've never told
anyone else before.

09:50.781 --> 09:52.685
[moaning on TV]

09:52.718 --> 09:54.723
-L-Laszlo?
-Good grief.

09:54.756 --> 09:56.292
You were going
to tell me something

09:56.325 --> 09:58.363
-you never told
anyone before...?
-Shh. [laughs]

09:58.396 --> 10:00.000
You might have
to give me a minute.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.803
[Guillermo]
So, yeah, even Laszlo came by.

10:01.836 --> 10:03.339
If I would've known how...

10:03.372 --> 10:05.010
my last couple of days
would play out,

10:05.043 --> 10:06.713
how the last couple of months...

10:06.746 --> 10:08.216
I would've never asked
Derek to turn me.

10:08.249 --> 10:10.120
It's not that
I don't want to die,

10:10.153 --> 10:11.990
and trust me, I really,
really don't want to die,

10:12.023 --> 10:15.698
but I'm just more afraid
of losing the vampires.

10:15.731 --> 10:17.100
My friends.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.871
I always figured if I got
turned into a vampire

10:18.904 --> 10:21.442
that it would...
bring me closer to them.

10:21.475 --> 10:24.414
But it's just left me
feeling more alone than ever.

10:25.183 --> 10:27.989
Nandor, can I ask you
a question?

10:28.022 --> 10:29.759
Yes, Patton Oswalt.

10:29.792 --> 10:33.166
Your friendship with Guillermo
is very special, right?

10:33.199 --> 10:35.370
I thought it was.

10:35.403 --> 10:38.109
And I bet...

10:38.142 --> 10:40.748
killing a friend...

10:40.781 --> 10:42.184
would really hurt.

10:42.217 --> 10:44.388
I imagine it would be
one of the worst feelings

10:44.421 --> 10:46.158
a person could have.

10:46.191 --> 10:48.396
So, what if you...

10:48.429 --> 10:50.400
repair the friendship?

10:50.433 --> 10:52.137
-You repair it--
-So you're saying

10:52.170 --> 10:55.143
that I should not kill
my former friend?

10:55.176 --> 10:57.414
-Uh, yes, you-you--
-This is your suggestion?

10:57.447 --> 10:59.084
Well, you know, you rebuild--

10:59.117 --> 11:01.757
After hearing my tale
of deceit and betrayal?

11:01.790 --> 11:05.230
All that betray me
must be destroyed.

11:05.263 --> 11:07.234
-Wait, wait--
-Goodbye, Patton Oswalt.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.271
[screaming]

11:09.304 --> 11:10.775
[body thudding, crashing]

11:10.808 --> 11:12.044
-[loud thud]
-[sighs]

11:12.077 --> 11:14.247
He does make
a good point, though.

11:18.824 --> 11:20.894
-[on video] ...arm,
and a block of--
-[knocking loudly]

11:21.963 --> 11:23.366
Of course.

11:23.399 --> 11:27.775
Hi. I just came by
to pay you my condolences.

11:27.808 --> 11:31.182
"Sorry for your loss
of your life."

11:31.215 --> 11:33.754
Is there anyone who doesn't
know that I'm here?

11:33.787 --> 11:36.158
Well, I'm usually the last one
to know, so probably not.

11:36.191 --> 11:37.461
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

11:37.494 --> 11:39.131
And then I also brought
some friends

11:39.164 --> 11:40.768
who wanted to say goodbye.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.337
Hiya, Daddy.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.375
-Hey.
-Guide lady said
you're going off

11:44.408 --> 11:45.443
-to a big, beautiful...
-Hey, big guy.

11:45.476 --> 11:47.447
...farm in the sky.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.285
-Can we come?
-[Guillermo] Oh...

11:49.318 --> 11:50.888
-No, buddy.
-Aw.

11:50.921 --> 11:55.063
-There's no room at the farm.
-[sniffling]

11:55.096 --> 11:56.867
"In the death of a good man,

11:56.900 --> 11:59.004
eternity is seen looking
through time."

11:59.037 --> 12:00.841
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

12:00.874 --> 12:03.212
-[sobbing]
-Okay.

12:03.245 --> 12:04.949
-So-- Oh.
-[phone buzzing]

12:04.982 --> 12:06.052
Sorry.

12:06.085 --> 12:07.889
Hola, Ma.

12:07.922 --> 12:09.859
[Nandor]
Hello, Guillermo.

12:09.892 --> 12:11.897
I've been looking for you.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.567
Where are you?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.873
Oh, I'm right here having a nice
conversation with your mother.

12:16.906 --> 12:19.445
In her apartment.
Where she lives.

12:19.478 --> 12:21.015
My mother has nothing
to do with this.

12:21.048 --> 12:22.518
If you touch her, I swear...

12:24.087 --> 12:25.858
[Silvia speaking Spanish]

12:25.891 --> 12:27.562
Well, you know where I am.
Why don't you come over here

12:27.595 --> 12:29.365
and we can discuss
what happens next.

12:29.398 --> 12:30.500
[phone beeps]

12:30.534 --> 12:32.404
-I have to go.
-Bye, Daddy.

12:32.437 --> 12:34.041
Have you checked out already?
Or is it okay if we hang here?

12:34.074 --> 12:35.811
[Dog Guillermo]
He's not coming back.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.217
-Ah, come on, you stupid...
-[dings]

12:42.390 --> 12:44.529
-Get away from her.
-Guillermo.

12:44.562 --> 12:47.033
[speaking Spanish]

12:48.603 --> 12:49.839
I'll be back, okay?

12:49.872 --> 12:50.908
¿Cómo está, mijo?

12:50.941 --> 12:52.879
-Hey, Mami.
-Mwah.

12:52.912 --> 12:54.582
Don't be long, Sylvia.

12:54.615 --> 12:56.419
Still want to see
the photographs of Guillermo

12:56.452 --> 12:58.423
in this gotico phase.

12:58.456 --> 12:59.859
You can kill me if you want,

12:59.892 --> 13:00.995
but you leave her
out of this, okay?

13:01.028 --> 13:02.431
Oh, I know I could kill you.

13:02.464 --> 13:04.334
And you'd deserve it.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.407
[Guillermo panting]

13:09.545 --> 13:12.484
But I have decided not to.

13:12.518 --> 13:14.021
Yeah, well, I don't believe you.

13:14.054 --> 13:16.358
No, of course you don't.

13:16.391 --> 13:19.398
But something happened
recently and...

13:19.431 --> 13:21.202
it's made me change my mind.

13:21.235 --> 13:24.509
-Oh, yeah? What?
-My friend Patton Oswalt.

13:24.542 --> 13:27.515
He passed away quite suddenly.
And, um...

13:27.548 --> 13:31.021
it didn't feel good
losing a friend.

13:31.054 --> 13:33.059
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

13:33.092 --> 13:34.863
Because I give you
my word as a vampire.

13:34.896 --> 13:38.637
-[scoffs] Not good enough.
-Then I give you my word...

13:38.670 --> 13:40.206
as a warrior.

13:40.239 --> 13:42.578
-[hisses]
-[grunts]

13:43.947 --> 13:45.984
[speaking Persian]

13:46.986 --> 13:49.324
Translation:

13:49.357 --> 13:51.161
"If I'm lying...

13:52.698 --> 13:54.502
...then kill me now."

14:04.354 --> 14:05.490
Then it is settled.

14:05.524 --> 14:07.494
You'll come home with me, alive.

14:07.528 --> 14:08.630
Mami, no!

14:08.663 --> 14:11.302
[speaks Spanish]

14:11.335 --> 14:12.471
Wow, that worked.

14:12.505 --> 14:14.108
-Mm?
-Hmm?

14:14.141 --> 14:15.644
[owl hoots]

14:15.677 --> 14:17.147
We return with news.

14:17.180 --> 14:19.686
I no longer plan
to kill Guillermo.

14:19.719 --> 14:21.222
-Yay.
-[Nadja] Yay.

14:21.255 --> 14:22.592
He will live here
in this house, with us,

14:22.625 --> 14:24.394
-as an equal.
-[Laszlo laughs]

14:24.427 --> 14:26.098
As a vampire.

14:26.131 --> 14:29.138
-Boo.
-Where once we were four,
we are now five.

14:29.171 --> 14:30.541
I think your math is off.

14:30.574 --> 14:32.578
If I had known Gizmo was
going to stay with us,

14:32.611 --> 14:34.949
I would've said just kill him
and be done with it.

14:34.982 --> 14:36.586
[Colin]
Where is he going to sit?

14:36.619 --> 14:38.422
I-I'm not giving up my seat.
So where is he going to sit?

14:38.455 --> 14:42.030
Hold on a second. Gizmo cannot
fully become a vampire

14:42.063 --> 14:43.667
due to his Van Helsing blood.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.270
[Nandor]
Laszlo, Laszlo,

14:45.303 --> 14:47.407
with all your experiments
and your notetaking,

14:47.440 --> 14:49.679
and your weird-ass,
hybrid freaks,

14:49.712 --> 14:52.217
you never thought of
the simplest solution.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.724
-Which is?
-You never got Guillermo
to drink human blood.

14:55.757 --> 15:00.132
-Wait. Y-You never
thought of that?
-Shut up.

15:01.503 --> 15:03.640
-I don't think I can do this.
-You must.

15:03.673 --> 15:05.243
Or else you'll be
eternally frozen

15:05.276 --> 15:07.581
in this painful, unending limbo.
Now drink.

15:09.017 --> 15:10.453
Come on, Guillermo.

15:10.486 --> 15:12.224
-Drink, bitch.
-[Colin] Yeah, drink it, bitch.

15:12.257 --> 15:14.194
-[Laszlo] Yes.
-Drink it.
-[Nadja] Swallow it all.

15:14.227 --> 15:15.664
-Drink. Drink.
-[Nadja] Suck on it, baby.
Come on, drink!

15:15.697 --> 15:17.568
-Swallow it.
-Drink. Drink.
-Oi, drink.

15:17.601 --> 15:18.636
-Drink. Drink.
-[Nadja] Drink it.
Take it like a man.

15:20.373 --> 15:21.576
[gasps]

15:21.609 --> 15:23.246
[Laszlo]
Fangs.

15:23.279 --> 15:25.718
-[laughs]
-Wow
-Ah.

15:25.751 --> 15:27.354
I've never felt more alive.

15:27.387 --> 15:29.258
I really should've
thought of that.

15:29.291 --> 15:30.393
I'm a vampire. [laughs]

15:30.426 --> 15:31.696
I'm a vampire!

15:31.729 --> 15:35.170
-I'm a vampire!
-[Laszlo] Yahoo.

15:35.203 --> 15:36.238
Yep.

15:36.271 --> 15:37.742
-Nicely done.
-[laughs]

15:37.775 --> 15:41.081
[whooshing]

15:41.114 --> 15:44.154
-One sip of blood and he's
like Cornholio over here.
-[Laszlo laughs]

15:44.187 --> 15:45.356
Yes.

15:45.389 --> 15:46.526
-[Laszlo] He likes that.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.229
-[glass shatters]
-[Nadja] Ooh.

15:48.262 --> 15:51.202
Behold what I've become.

15:51.235 --> 15:53.306
Yes, yes, we've all been there.

15:53.339 --> 15:55.076
Why are we all
sitting on our asses?

15:55.109 --> 15:56.746
Let's do something!
What do we do next?

15:56.779 --> 15:57.782
Get a broom.

15:57.815 --> 15:59.752
Now, we hunt!

15:59.785 --> 16:02.558
-[cheering]
-[Nadja] I'm sorry,
Mommy needs to eat.

16:02.591 --> 16:04.294
-[Nandor] Hunt, hunt, hunt!
-[sighs]

16:04.327 --> 16:05.496
Hunt, hunt!

16:05.530 --> 16:07.266
FOMO.

16:10.439 --> 16:12.410
[Colin speaking quietly]

16:12.443 --> 16:14.014
Which reminds me,

16:14.047 --> 16:16.653
what's the fastest way
to become a millionaire?

16:16.686 --> 16:20.460
You start as a billionaire
and buy a winery.

16:20.493 --> 16:23.099
[chuckles] Just a little
wine humor for you.

16:23.132 --> 16:24.434
Oh. [belches]

16:24.467 --> 16:25.671
[Colin] Sommeliers are
a dying breed...

16:25.704 --> 16:28.309
Oh. I've eaten too much.
I feel sick.

16:28.342 --> 16:29.746
Go on, Guillermo.

16:29.779 --> 16:32.785
I bonked this one on the head
just for you.

16:32.818 --> 16:34.454
They're much easier
to drain and kill

16:34.487 --> 16:36.225
when they're not
wriggling around.

16:36.258 --> 16:38.296
Oh, no, I-I'm actually
not that hungry.

16:38.329 --> 16:41.068
Okay, well, FYI, if you leave
them hanging around too long

16:41.101 --> 16:44.742
when they're unconscious,
their blood, it loses its zing.

16:44.775 --> 16:47.047
[growling, slurping]

16:47.080 --> 16:49.351
[Guillermo]
I've never killed anyone before.

16:49.384 --> 16:52.157
I mean, I guess dozens
of vampires.

16:52.190 --> 16:53.760
And I did bring humans

16:53.793 --> 16:55.598
to the vampires
so they could kill them.

16:55.631 --> 16:56.833
And I've dismembered,

16:56.866 --> 16:58.704
like, a ton of dead bodies.

16:58.737 --> 17:01.275
But back at the restaurant,
that was a real living person.

17:01.308 --> 17:03.513
And when I leaned in to take...

17:03.546 --> 17:04.515
I could...
