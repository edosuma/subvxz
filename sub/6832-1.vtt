00:43.535 --> 00:45.870
All units, all units.
Code 3 pursuit of 2-11.

00:46.038 --> 00:48.539
White SUV heading east
on Alameda service road.

00:48.707 --> 00:50.082
Suspects: Three Asian males.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.836
Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.223
Cheryl, can you see how many
suspects are in this car?

01:48.350 --> 01:51.811
As far as I can see at this point,
there are three sus...

01:51.979 --> 01:53.688
Oh, this is just coming in.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.023
Hancock!

02:05.158 --> 02:06.409
What, boy?

02:07.411 --> 02:08.744
Bad guys.

02:08.912 --> 02:11.372
- Trying to cut them off.
You can see them there.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.708
They have their hands
outside the white SUV...

02:13.876 --> 02:17.461
...shooting randomly on the freeway.

02:17.754 --> 02:20.673
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

02:21.758 --> 02:22.842
Asshole.

02:23.468 --> 02:25.845
- What?
- You heard me.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.395
Please, stay off the freeway.

02:34.563 --> 02:38.190
I understand that there are
three suspects in the white SUV...

02:38.358 --> 02:39.984
Asshole.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.309
Watch out!

03:13.894 --> 03:15.728
Damn!

03:16.438 --> 03:18.314
Damn it!

03:51.014 --> 03:52.431
Hancock!?!

03:53.475 --> 03:55.476
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy! '

03:56.395 --> 03:57.687
Hancock is in the car...

03:57.854 --> 04:00.356
...and he appears to be
negotiating with the gunmen.

04:01.191 --> 04:02.900
He smells like a bar!

04:04.403 --> 04:06.404
You pay for new roof!

04:06.571 --> 04:10.408
Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.

04:10.575 --> 04:14.286
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.955
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

04:16.623 --> 04:20.625
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...

04:20.793 --> 04:25.256
...I swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.

04:25.424 --> 04:28.843
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

04:29.011 --> 04:31.470
...because your head
is going up my ass.

04:32.389 --> 04:34.598
Shoot this asshole!

04:39.688 --> 04:40.730
Stop!

04:41.690 --> 04:43.024
What the F%

04:55.662 --> 04:59.415
The department is on their way.
There's just chaos here on the 105.

05:12.804 --> 05:15.139
What? I'm not Japanese, man!

05:15.307 --> 05:16.348
Put us down!

05:16.892 --> 05:19.810
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

05:31.990 --> 05:33.491
You broke my glasses.

05:33.658 --> 05:35.910
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

05:36.661 --> 05:39.205
- Put us down!
- You want down?

05:39.372 --> 05:40.831
- Yes, please! Please!
- Help me!

05:40.999 --> 05:44.460
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.

05:44.628 --> 05:45.961
All right? All right.

05:51.927 --> 05:55.513
This, Hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...

05:55.680 --> 05:57.765
...took a hefty financial toll.

05:57.933 --> 06:02.186
Initial damage estimates
are said to top $9 million...

06:02.354 --> 06:03.562
...which, if accurate...

06:03.939 --> 06:05.898
...represents a personal record...

06:06.066 --> 06:09.276
...for the notoriously publicity-shy
Hancock...

06:09.444 --> 06:13.322
...who, as usual,
can't be reached for comment.

06:13.490 --> 06:18.327
With all the cracks to the concrete,
all the bullets, water damage, fires...

06:18.495 --> 06:21.080
...L.A. would be better off
if this guy would leave...

06:21.248 --> 06:22.915
...and let us get on with our jobs.

06:56.992 --> 06:58.534
Hi.

06:59.578 --> 07:02.538
Don't think I'm crazy, okay?
We've looked everywhere for you.

07:02.706 --> 07:06.375
Going to the Roxy
and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...

07:06.543 --> 07:10.170
...anywhere we thought
you would be at. I found you.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.756
I got you.

07:13.842 --> 07:15.676
So, what's it like when you fly?

07:19.890 --> 07:22.600
- No, what?
- I ain't gonna fly you.

07:22.934 --> 07:26.228
I got a cousin, Narelle. She's my
best friend in the entire world...

07:26.396 --> 07:29.690
...and I swear to God she would not
be here today if it wasn't for you.

07:30.525 --> 07:33.694
She crashed her car up in Malibu
when you flew her to the hospital.

07:33.862 --> 07:35.362
Remember?

07:35.530 --> 07:38.407
I will break my foot off
in your ass, woman.

07:42.579 --> 07:44.204
You got a car?

08:08.396 --> 08:09.897
Hey, want a drink?

08:11.066 --> 08:14.985
So this is where you live.
This is your hideout.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.738
Your Batcave.

08:18.239 --> 08:20.741
Your Fortress of Solitude.

08:22.285 --> 08:25.996
- It's a couple trailers I stuck together.
- What's all this?

08:27.332 --> 08:29.833
- Jiffy Pop.
- Jiffy Pop.

08:30.085 --> 08:32.628
- What do you do with it?
- Pop it.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.798
- Jiffy Pop, pop. I like that.
- Hey, hey.

08:35.966 --> 08:37.006
Hold on.

08:37.174 --> 08:39.677
Want me to give you
something else to pop?

08:40.178 --> 08:42.846
- I didn't catch your name.
- Pop this, Superman.

08:43.014 --> 08:46.517
Not much for the chitchat, huh?
Let me set this over here.

08:46.685 --> 08:48.727
- All right. Now, there are some rules.
- Hello?

08:48.895 --> 08:51.355
- No, I know, I haven't seen it yet.
- Excuse me.

08:51.523 --> 08:53.524
I know, probably. All right, all right.

08:53.692 --> 08:55.609
- Let me call you back.
- Listen.

08:56.444 --> 08:59.571
You're gonna need to focus.
All right, I need you...

08:59.739 --> 09:02.449
- Hey, that's... That's not focusing.
- What's in there?

09:02.617 --> 09:06.704
Okay, all right, hold on.
Stop. Stop it. All right, now...

09:06.871 --> 09:10.082
...when I get to the moment...
- The moment?

09:10.250 --> 09:15.129
You know, the... Start climbing
the mountaintop, you know?

09:15.296 --> 09:17.506
- You know... All right? Yes.
- Yeah.

09:17.674 --> 09:20.342
You're gonna need to be as far away
from that as possible.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.803
- Far. That's hot.
- No, that's not hot. It's not hot.

09:22.971 --> 09:25.222
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

09:26.224 --> 09:29.101
Hancock. Oh, yeah.

09:30.353 --> 09:33.188
- Now you're doing too much.
- Hancock.

09:33.356 --> 09:36.483
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!

09:36.651 --> 09:38.652
Mountaintop! Watch out!

09:59.758 --> 10:01.467
Sorry.

10:04.929 --> 10:07.347
That's not fair to anybody.

10:12.604 --> 10:14.897
Thank you for being okay with that.

10:15.065 --> 10:19.026
- I know it's...
- Can I use the bathroom, please?

10:19.194 --> 10:22.488
Yeah. Hey, you...?
You want some Jiffy Pop?

10:22.655 --> 10:26.116
- No, thanks.
- It's straight back.

10:28.119 --> 10:29.620
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:29.788 --> 10:31.997
Yeah, I was trying to tell you.

10:37.295 --> 10:39.046
Hey...

10:44.385 --> 10:49.223
Listen... You know, if you want
I could fly you.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.811
It's really beautiful, you know?
Earth.

10:54.562 --> 10:57.022
You could see the...

11:01.861 --> 11:06.824
Might have to get you a helmet,
so your face doesn't tear off.

11:07.909 --> 11:09.660
What do you think?

11:49.868 --> 11:51.618
Sir? Ray Embrey.

11:51.786 --> 11:53.120
- Ray.
- Pleasure.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.707
- So...
- Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.003
Well, actually, I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but I do try.

12:01.171 --> 12:02.838
Well, let's see it.

12:03.047 --> 12:06.425
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.

12:06.593 --> 12:10.137
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.514
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

12:12.682 --> 12:15.475
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...

12:15.643 --> 12:19.730
...and you get an armband, or a ribbon
or whatever. It's nowhere near enough.

12:19.981 --> 12:24.735
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

12:24.986 --> 12:26.904
...the AllHeart symbol.

12:27.197 --> 12:32.701
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

12:33.203 --> 12:36.246
...to bear this logo on your product.

12:36.414 --> 12:38.415
And what this would say
to the public...

12:38.583 --> 12:40.500
...is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...

12:40.668 --> 12:45.047
...has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

12:45.215 --> 12:47.132
Here's all you need to do to qualify.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.220
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?

12:51.387 --> 12:54.514
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

12:58.061 --> 12:59.770
- Did you say "free"?
- I did.

13:02.565 --> 13:03.815
Only to those who need it.

13:03.983 --> 13:07.402
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.

13:07.612 --> 13:11.531
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.

13:11.699 --> 13:14.201
- Mandatory product recall.
- Get indicted, go to jail.

13:14.369 --> 13:17.246
Get out, work at IHOP
for the rest of your career.

13:17.413 --> 13:19.831
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.

13:19.999 --> 13:24.336
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.796
The brand...

13:26.005 --> 13:29.591
...that everyone is talking about.

13:29.759 --> 13:31.677
Who is "everyone"?

13:31.844 --> 13:34.471
We do already have
a sports franchise.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.683
- NFL? NBA? MLB?
- Soccer.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.269
MLS? Which team?

13:40.436 --> 13:43.480
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.108
It's my son's team.

13:46.609 --> 13:50.362
Anyway, we can save the world.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.865
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.493
What do you say?

13:58.288 --> 14:00.706
Are you a crackpot?

14:08.881 --> 14:12.384
Hey, hon. You're probably at the store.
I am on my way.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.887
I think I made a connection.

14:17.181 --> 14:18.265
Not really.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.892
Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming
and I... Damn it.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.312
And I want some meatballs, okay?

14:23.479 --> 14:27.190
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.

14:27.358 --> 14:30.902
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?

14:31.696 --> 14:33.613
Idiot.

14:37.493 --> 14:39.036
Hey.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.954
Hey. Hey!

14:41.164 --> 14:43.290
Move it. There's a train coming.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.709
Do you not hear that horn?

14:45.918 --> 14:48.378
Let's go! I got a train!

14:48.546 --> 14:50.339
Move it!

14:50.631 --> 14:53.800
- Back your car up! There's a train!
- I can't go anywhere. Get out!

14:53.968 --> 14:55.469
Son of a bitch!

14:57.347 --> 14:59.556
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.

15:05.063 --> 15:06.688
Get out!

15:12.445 --> 15:14.488
Get off the track! Move!

15:23.122 --> 15:25.499
- Let's get him out.
- Get him out of there.

15:25.666 --> 15:27.876
- Somebody help him.
- You all right?

15:28.044 --> 15:30.754
Please, that guy's still in there.

15:32.340 --> 15:33.423
You sure?

15:33.633 --> 15:36.259
Get him out of there!

15:42.850 --> 15:44.351
Will you look at that?

16:05.706 --> 16:10.043
- Ah, shit.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

16:10.211 --> 16:11.503
All of you people...

16:12.296 --> 16:14.881
...blocking the intersection...

16:15.216 --> 16:16.675
...you're all idiots.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.970
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

16:20.138 --> 16:23.515
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?

16:24.475 --> 16:26.435
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

16:26.602 --> 16:30.647
- She's right. She should sue you.
- Yeah, she should sue you.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.692
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.236
You're an asshole.

16:36.404 --> 16:38.738
And I can smell
that liquor on your breath.

16:38.948 --> 16:42.075
- Because I've been drinking, bitch.
- You're a drunk asshole!

16:42.243 --> 16:46.079
- You think you're such a hero.
- Asshole!

16:46.998 --> 16:50.375
- You're nothing but an asshole.
- We don't need you in this city.

16:52.170 --> 16:55.380
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

16:56.174 --> 16:57.841
Shut up!

16:58.009 --> 16:59.593
Don't you understand? I'm alive.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.430
I get to go home and see my family.
I should be dead right now, right here.

17:03.598 --> 17:06.558
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.645
You know, and I was upside down
for the train, but...

17:11.646 --> 17:14.023
No. Thank you.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.277
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.

17:17.444 --> 17:19.695
Thank you, Hancock.

17:23.617 --> 17:26.453
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.667
Throw the ball!

17:33.711 --> 17:36.713
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.049
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"

17:39.217 --> 17:42.886
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

17:43.804 --> 17:46.681
Great. Thank you.

17:47.016 --> 17:49.392
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but...

17:49.560 --> 17:51.394
- What's going on, Dad?
- Hey, buddy.

17:51.562 --> 17:54.189
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?

17:54.357 --> 17:55.690
I want you to meet somebody.

17:55.858 --> 17:59.236
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.863
- Who's this?
- Hancock.

18:02.031 --> 18:04.282
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.118
- Ray, what happened to the car?
- Oh, boy.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.995
You would not have believed it.

18:09.413 --> 18:13.166
I came this close to getting hit
by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...

18:13.334 --> 18:16.545
He saved my life. I mean...
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.

18:16.712 --> 18:20.799
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.
Saw my whole life flash before my eyes.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.510
- He saved your life?
- He sure did. Thank you.

18:23.678 --> 18:25.345
- Hey, you good?
- I am good, yeah.

18:25.513 --> 18:29.849
- All right. Keep it off the tracks.
- I will, definitely.

18:34.021 --> 18:35.605
Hang on a... One second.

18:35.773 --> 18:39.192
- Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
- Yeah.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.694
- You like meatballs?
- No.

18:40.861 --> 18:42.904
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do...

18:43.072 --> 18:46.116
- I love meatballs.
- Who's so busy they can't have a meal?

18:46.284 --> 18:47.784
And it's on us. Please.

18:47.952 --> 18:51.413
I'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.

19:16.147 --> 19:19.149
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.068
Do you like eagles?

19:22.278 --> 19:24.446
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?

19:24.614 --> 19:26.573
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.

19:26.741 --> 19:29.200
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?

19:30.244 --> 19:32.245
No? All right.

19:33.331 --> 19:36.333
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

19:36.500 --> 19:40.211
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in...

19:40.379 --> 19:41.630
- Ever.
- Yeah.

19:41.797 --> 19:44.049
- Ever? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.

19:44.216 --> 19:47.218
- A very long time.
- That's some good meatballs, boy.

19:47.553 --> 19:48.720
Aaron.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.805
- Your mama's calling you.
- Yes, Mom?

19:50.973 --> 19:53.308
No. His name is Aaron.

19:53.476 --> 19:56.603
- Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
- Fine.

19:56.771 --> 19:59.481
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?

19:59.649 --> 20:02.984
- Michel. But not like a girl's name.
- Michel. No, no, I know.

20:03.152 --> 20:05.695
- It's French.
- Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...

20:06.322 --> 20:09.240
Hancock? Michel
is this neighborhood bully.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.576
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...

20:11.744 --> 20:14.454
...about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?

20:14.622 --> 20:18.333
- Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
- That's exactly right.

20:18.626 --> 20:21.878
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?

20:22.046 --> 20:23.421
Never let them punk you.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.215
- Got it, Mr. Hancock.
- Aaron, eat.

20:25.549 --> 20:28.885
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...

20:29.053 --> 20:31.971
...bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.

20:32.139 --> 20:34.516
You don't have to do that, honey, okay?
Seriously.

20:34.684 --> 20:35.725
It's a good idea.

20:35.893 --> 20:38.770
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

20:38.938 --> 20:42.065
...for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.692
Okay, please, just stop.

20:43.859 --> 20:45.610
Michel is not a man, okay?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.570
He's a little boy. And his parents...

20:47.738 --> 20:51.282
...happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.784
Maybe you don't know this...

20:52.952 --> 20:56.079
...but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

20:56.247 --> 20:58.289
- Not everything has to be bang...
- I'm set.

20:58.457 --> 21:03.294
...scream, blood, more blood.
- Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

21:03.462 --> 21:04.879
She watches so much news...

21:05.047 --> 21:07.632
...that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.261
- You got a toilet?
- Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.

21:14.473 --> 21:16.391
Are...?

21:18.477 --> 21:22.439
Did he just take the whiskey bottle
to the bathroom?

21:22.606 --> 21:24.107
Do you want him to kill us all?

21:24.483 --> 21:26.276
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?

21:26.444 --> 21:28.611
- Very, yeah.
- Wanna say goodbye to him?

21:28.779 --> 21:31.072
- Bye, Hancock.
- Hey, all right, little buddy.

21:32.867 --> 21:35.368
- Are you okay?
- It was a joke.

21:35.536 --> 21:38.079
- Come on, Aaron.
- Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...

21:38.247 --> 21:39.664
He got it. She didn't get it.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.250
I owe you.
You gave me my life back today.

21:42.418 --> 21:44.461
Hear me out.
I'd like to return the favor.

21:44.628 --> 21:47.338
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.

21:47.506 --> 21:51.134
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

21:51.302 --> 21:54.679
We change the way people see
products, companies, people, that stuff.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.849
Listen, I see you on the news
and I see you out there today...

21:58.017 --> 22:01.519
...and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.772
- It's good to meet you, Ray.
- No, I'm sorry.

22:03.939 --> 22:05.148
But hear me out.

22:05.316 --> 22:08.985
People... Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.988
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.573
You know, you're a superhero.

22:13.741 --> 22:15.784
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

22:15.951 --> 22:17.786
People should cheer you
on the streets.

22:17.953 --> 22:19.829
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?

22:19.997 --> 22:21.831
No, no, they're not... It's all right.

22:21.999 --> 22:23.958
They're not pricks, they're just people.

22:24.126 --> 22:27.629
But I want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?

22:27.797 --> 22:30.465
That's all I ask. Okay?

22:30.633 --> 22:32.467
You use...

22:32.760 --> 22:34.677
Put it under here?

22:35.346 --> 22:37.222
Put it right there. Perfect.

22:37.389 --> 22:40.266
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, I don't know.

22:40.434 --> 22:41.851
I want you to think about it.

22:42.019 --> 22:44.562
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?

22:44.730 --> 22:46.856
You get back to me?

22:47.191 --> 22:48.942
I'll be right here. All right.

22:49.109 --> 22:53.571
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

22:59.370 --> 23:00.620
What about AllHeart?

23:00.788 --> 23:04.082
It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.418
Maybe I can't change the world
but I can change this guy's life.

23:07.586 --> 23:11.256
- Think about all the good he can do.
- I think you're wasting your time.

23:11.549 --> 23:13.174
You really hate him.

23:13.342 --> 23:16.511
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
I don't even know the guy.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.682
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.

23:20.850 --> 23:24.435
I think he just needs
people to care, you know?

23:26.146 --> 23:28.147
You see the good in everybody, Ray.

23:28.315 --> 23:31.317
Even sometimes when it's not there.

23:32.736 --> 23:36.573
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

23:39.368 --> 23:42.161
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

25:42.658 --> 25:44.242
My bad. Everybody all right?

25:44.410 --> 25:47.036
I'll go and get my mommy.

25:47.204 --> 25:49.580
He is an asshole.

25:57.006 --> 25:59.090
- What's your name, boy?
- Michel.

26:02.136 --> 26:05.722
- You know who I am?
- My papa says you are an asshole.

26:05.889 --> 26:08.683
Well, that's not really a nice word
to call a person, is it?

26:08.851 --> 26:10.727
- Asshole?
- Yeah.

26:10.894 --> 26:13.938
Because that could make someone
very angry...

26:14.106 --> 26:16.315
...and, you know, maybe
hurt their feelings.

26:16.483 --> 26:18.026
You behave like an asshole.

26:22.239 --> 26:23.322
All right...

26:23.490 --> 26:25.033
Do you know Aaron?

26:29.163 --> 26:33.666
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.

26:33.834 --> 26:36.210
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.

26:36.378 --> 26:38.087
Why, asshole?

26:41.425 --> 26:43.926
- You're gonna stop calling me that.
- Asshole.

26:44.595 --> 26:48.139
- That's not my name.
- Asshole.

26:52.269 --> 26:54.604
Call me a asshole...

26:54.772 --> 26:56.147
...one more time.

27:00.069 --> 27:01.903
Asshole.

27:04.865 --> 27:07.033
How about you, thickness?

27:07.618 --> 27:08.701
Goggles?

27:09.286 --> 27:12.789
Hancock! You son of a gun,
I knew you'd come.

27:12.956 --> 27:14.373
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.

27:14.541 --> 27:16.793
I said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.712
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.380
I'll meet you in the house.

27:21.548 --> 27:24.592
- I know you don't drive, but...
- Oh, damn it, Ray.

27:25.928 --> 27:30.264
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.

27:32.267 --> 27:35.436
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.

27:36.563 --> 27:39.398
- Not okay. Okay?
- He all right.

27:39.817 --> 27:42.819
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.

27:42.986 --> 27:46.072
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

27:46.240 --> 27:48.991
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

27:49.201 --> 27:52.453
No, that was already like that
when I got here, Ray.

27:52.663 --> 27:54.789
I live here.
I know what the street's like.

27:54.998 --> 27:56.833
We'll make those problems
of the past.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.544
I'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.

27:59.711 --> 28:02.880
- Where's the wife?
- Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.007
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.

28:05.175 --> 28:09.470
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

28:09.638 --> 28:10.930
What is this?

28:11.098 --> 28:13.850
That's me trying to change the world.

28:14.017 --> 28:15.935
Unfortunately, not doing real well.

28:16.144 --> 28:18.062
Come on. Let's get to you.

28:18.438 --> 28:20.690
This stuff was on YouTube.

28:20.858 --> 28:24.193
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.

28:24.361 --> 28:28.155
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.

28:29.074 --> 28:32.702
Mom! Mom! Mom!

28:33.120 --> 28:34.662
Those are children.

28:36.582 --> 28:39.750
- We've been waiting a long time...
- Get that camera out of my face.

28:40.043 --> 28:43.296
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?

28:43.505 --> 28:47.049
- No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
- No. My ass was hot.

28:48.552 --> 28:51.470
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the gray whale.

28:51.638 --> 28:54.432
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.641
Along comes Hancock.

28:58.228 --> 29:00.021
Hancock!

29:09.531 --> 29:12.116
- I don't even remember that.
- Yeah.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.411
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

29:16.163 --> 29:17.914
This gets redundant after a while...

29:18.081 --> 29:21.208
...but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is...

29:21.376 --> 29:23.044
- Do you wanna hear it?
- No.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.545
You're an asshole.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.006
I know. I call it like I see it though.

29:27.174 --> 29:30.176
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

29:30.344 --> 29:32.345
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?

29:32.512 --> 29:34.180
Be careful.

29:34.348 --> 29:37.600
All right, how about this?
I've been thinking about something.

29:37.768 --> 29:40.394
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.

29:40.562 --> 29:43.856
Come on. Really? It's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...

29:45.067 --> 29:46.484
...when you see this?

29:48.320 --> 29:49.403
Homo.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.240
- What about that?
- Homo in red.

29:56.870 --> 29:58.704
- Norwegian homo.
- I'll give you that.

29:58.872 --> 30:02.208
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

30:02.376 --> 30:07.588
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

30:07.756 --> 30:10.675
I think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.

30:12.094 --> 30:14.387
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...

30:14.554 --> 30:17.640
...and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.

30:17.808 --> 30:20.643
And it's a...
And we're gonna switch that cycle.

30:20.811 --> 30:22.603
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.

30:22.771 --> 30:26.691
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower...

30:26.984 --> 30:29.110
- Almost.
- And then he kicked it in.

30:29.277 --> 30:31.237
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.

30:31.405 --> 30:34.699
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.

30:34.866 --> 30:36.283
Hey, sweetheart.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.245
Have you been watching the news?

30:39.413 --> 30:42.206
- No, we've been working on...
- Interfacing with the public.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.542
- This has been on all day.
- That's very good.

30:44.710 --> 30:48.129
The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,
and you are not above it.

30:49.923 --> 30:51.590
Felony destruction of property...

30:51.758 --> 30:55.553
...amounting to tens of millions
of dollars, theft, and now this.

30:55.721 --> 31:00.182
From where I sit,
I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...

31:00.350 --> 31:04.687
...with a lot of muscle, but no regard
for anyone but yourself.

31:04.855 --> 31:07.189
Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.

31:07.357 --> 31:10.151
You are not above the law.

31:10.318 --> 31:15.239
You have failed to show
at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.

31:15.407 --> 31:19.076
Anybody else would be held
in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.

31:19.286 --> 31:22.371
You may be a superhero,
but let me tell you this:

31:22.539 --> 31:26.417
You're not nearly as strong
as the U.S. Constitution.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.085
Bank on it, buddy.

31:28.670 --> 31:29.962
We do not condone the t...

31:31.715 --> 31:33.174
Genius.

31:33.341 --> 31:35.926
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.

31:36.094 --> 31:39.096
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.

31:39.264 --> 31:41.891
- Bitch can try.
- I say you go.

31:45.562 --> 31:48.022
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

31:48.190 --> 31:51.358
- People don't like you, Hancock.
- I do.

31:51.526 --> 31:54.570
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamoring for you.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.447
When they do, we'll be ready.

31:56.615 --> 32:00.284
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.

32:01.078 --> 32:02.703
What do you got to lose?

32:21.431 --> 32:24.183
"I apologize to the people
of Los Angeles.

32:24.351 --> 32:27.895
My behavior has been improper
and I accept the consequences.

32:28.355 --> 32:30.731
I ask my fellow Angelenos...

32:30.899 --> 32:32.858
...for their patience
and understanding."

32:33.026 --> 32:35.569
You're an asshole, Hancock!

32:35.737 --> 32:36.779
Asshole!

32:39.699 --> 32:42.076
"Life here can be difficult for me.

32:42.244 --> 32:44.370
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.

32:46.123 --> 32:48.582
During my incarceration,
I will be participating...

32:48.750 --> 32:51.001
...in alcohol-
and anger-management treatment."

32:57.968 --> 32:59.135
You're a drunk bum!

32:59.302 --> 33:02.429
"You deserve better from me.
I can be better. I will be better."

33:02.597 --> 33:04.473
All right.

33:09.354 --> 33:12.148
Good morning, ladies.
Welcome to your new home...

33:14.151 --> 33:15.734
It is the duty of each of you...

33:15.902 --> 33:19.280
...to remember
your inmate serial number.

33:19.614 --> 33:21.615
Turn to your right.

33:23.785 --> 33:24.994
Turn to your left.

33:25.162 --> 33:27.997
Okay, scumbags. Let's go.

33:33.920 --> 33:36.255
Give me the hand, playboy.

33:55.317 --> 33:57.443
I see you, punk!

34:17.047 --> 34:18.880
Oh, I get it.

34:19.049 --> 34:22.467
I put some... Most of you in here.

34:22.636 --> 34:24.637
Yes, you did.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.476
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

34:31.645 --> 34:33.145
What?

34:34.063 --> 34:38.484
So I'm gonna do me,
and I'm gonna let you do you.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.819
I don't want no trouble.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.322
All right?

34:43.489 --> 34:45.491
I just wanna go to my cell.

34:45.659 --> 34:48.494
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Nope.

34:48.954 --> 34:50.955
Excuse me.

34:52.958 --> 34:55.751
Excuse me, please.

34:59.172 --> 35:01.173
Deadly.

35:02.008 --> 35:05.594
If you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.

35:13.561 --> 35:15.646
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?

35:16.147 --> 35:18.565
Choo, choo, asshole.

35:34.749 --> 35:37.126
Get him out! Get him out!

35:43.466 --> 35:46.677
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

35:53.601 --> 35:55.936
We're gonna...
We're gonna circle back to that.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.481
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.

35:59.649 --> 36:02.776
It's a big number,
but not something we didn't anticipate.

36:02.944 --> 36:05.029
You know, our plan is...
What are you doing?

36:05.196 --> 36:08.282
Hey, hey, hey!

36:13.079 --> 36:17.833
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.669
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behavior.

36:21.004 --> 36:24.965
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

36:25.133 --> 36:27.760
...and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...

36:27.927 --> 36:31.889
...the DA and the cops, they're all
gonna call for your immediate release.

36:32.057 --> 36:34.683
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.

36:34.851 --> 36:37.478
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

36:37.645 --> 36:38.854
- Stop it. Hancock.
- Move.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.564
- Hancock!
- Get back!

36:40.732 --> 36:42.274
You're being a coward!

36:43.068 --> 36:45.027
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.

36:45.195 --> 36:49.073
- Who are you talking to, Ray?
- Stop pretending that you do not care.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.700
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.

36:51.868 --> 36:55.704
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

36:55.872 --> 37:00.209
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.

37:00.710 --> 37:04.171
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

37:06.383 --> 37:08.050
How we gonna do that, Ray?

37:10.095 --> 37:12.221
All right, guys, let's start sharing.

37:12.389 --> 37:14.306
- Don? You had something?
- Yeah.

37:15.225 --> 37:19.603
Yeah, I think I might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.

37:19.896 --> 37:21.438
Good for you.

37:21.606 --> 37:26.402
Yeah, I mean, I realized
that breaking necks is... It's easy.

37:26.653 --> 37:31.990
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

37:32.158 --> 37:35.994
...and I thought, "This is tough."
- Yeah, it sounds tough.

37:37.205 --> 37:38.372
Why do you always laugh?

37:38.540 --> 37:41.959
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.

37:42.127 --> 37:45.963
Every time I'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.

37:46.131 --> 37:47.631
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.259
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

37:50.427 --> 37:51.677
No, no, no.

37:51.845 --> 37:53.929
- Keep sharing.
- Let's move on.

37:54.097 --> 37:55.973
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?

37:58.059 --> 37:59.143
Pass.

37:59.436 --> 38:02.938
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.

38:03.273 --> 38:06.442
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

38:06.609 --> 38:09.027
And don't land on
a $100,000 Mercedes. All right?

38:09.195 --> 38:11.947
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.

38:12.782 --> 38:14.074
Mr. Hancock, your share.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.243
Pass.

38:16.411 --> 38:19.163
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.832
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.251
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...

38:24.419 --> 38:26.170
...so tell him he's done a good job.

38:26.337 --> 38:29.256
What the hell did I have to come for
if he's done a good job?

38:40.143 --> 38:41.310
Oh, man!

38:43.438 --> 38:45.481
KBLA radio, AM 850.

38:45.648 --> 38:49.151
Today's big story, no surprise here:
Hancock. What's your take?

38:49.319 --> 38:51.195
I, for one, have
had enough of this guy.

38:51.362 --> 38:55.073
I'm glad he's doing time around bars
and I hope they don't let him off easy.

38:55.241 --> 38:56.617
Let my cousin Pookie out.

38:56.784 --> 38:59.578
"I see you don't wear
a bulletproof vest, security officer.

38:59.746 --> 39:00.954
I respect your courage...

39:01.122 --> 39:04.583
...because bullets don't bounce
off you, they bounce off me."

39:09.923 --> 39:12.257
This city is being run by gangs
and drug dealers.

39:12.425 --> 39:14.676
Hancock makes them
shake in their boots.

39:14.844 --> 39:18.055
He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon around it,
but he gets the job done.

39:18.223 --> 39:19.431
Besides, he's hot.

39:19.599 --> 39:23.852
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say, "Good job."

39:24.521 --> 39:26.146
G...

39:26.606 --> 39:27.814
Goo...

39:28.066 --> 39:30.692
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

39:30.860 --> 39:36.156
- Pass.
- Good.

39:36.407 --> 39:37.991
Good.

39:38.159 --> 39:43.247
Good j...

39:43.414 --> 39:49.169
Good job.

39:49.796 --> 39:53.549
Jail watch, day five, and true to his
word, Hancock remains incarcerated.

39:53.716 --> 39:55.759
Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.

39:55.927 --> 39:59.429
The L.A.P.D. is reporting
increases of up to 30 percent...

39:59.597 --> 40:04.017
...in the last five days
that Hancock has been behind bars.

40:08.523 --> 40:11.275
- Hancock! Hey, Hancock!
- Hey, little buddy.

40:11.442 --> 40:14.319
- Hancock. We brought you something!
- Hey, hey.

40:15.029 --> 40:17.406
Hey, what's up, Hancock?

40:17.740 --> 40:19.199
Where's...? Where's Ray?

40:19.617 --> 40:21.868
No, it's just us. Ray's working.

40:22.036 --> 40:24.037
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...

40:24.205 --> 40:27.416
...so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.

40:27.584 --> 40:30.002
I should probably let the guard
check for keys...

40:30.211 --> 40:34.131
- No, no. Here.
- Okay. Here you go.

40:34.841 --> 40:37.509
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?

40:37.677 --> 40:42.389
- Just dig in.
- Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.

40:46.519 --> 40:49.980
- That's a good meatball.
- Thanks, Hancock.

40:55.028 --> 40:56.445
Ray is a good man.

41:05.622 --> 41:07.998
Whatever this is you're doing,
don't let him down.

41:09.125 --> 41:11.001
Okay?

41:13.296 --> 41:15.714
Okay. Well, we should
probably go, buddy.

41:15.882 --> 41:18.842
- Already? I wanna stay with Hancock.
- Yeah. Sweetheart...

41:19.010 --> 41:21.845
...we have to go.
Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.

41:22.013 --> 41:25.223
Here, Hancock. It's my favorite one,
and I want you to have it.

41:25.516 --> 41:27.601
- That was very sweet.
- Thanks, Mom.

41:27.769 --> 41:29.353
Come here.

41:47.288 --> 41:50.040
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

41:50.208 --> 41:51.833
Pass.

41:52.001 --> 41:54.252
All right. Phillip?

41:56.923 --> 41:58.173
I love you guys, man.

41:58.341 --> 42:01.093
- We love you.
- We love you too, Phillip.

42:50.309 --> 42:51.435
For when they call.

42:57.567 --> 42:59.735
- I ain't wearing that, Ray.
- Yes, you are.

42:59.902 --> 43:01.611
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- No, you are.

43:01.779 --> 43:02.988
Actually, I'm not, Ray.

43:03.156 --> 43:04.948
You think you're not, but you are.

43:05.116 --> 43:09.995
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that, Ray.

43:10.538 --> 43:13.915
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.

43:14.083 --> 43:17.711
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.

43:17.879 --> 43:20.547
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?

43:20.715 --> 43:23.258
- It represents a calling.
- It's been two weeks.

43:23.426 --> 43:26.845
- Yeah?
- Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.390
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?

43:57.293 --> 43:59.836
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.

44:01.631 --> 44:02.756
Asshole!

44:06.844 --> 44:09.054
You're still a fake-ass punk.

44:24.237 --> 44:25.403
Damn!

44:25.571 --> 44:26.655
Mr. Hancock?

44:27.698 --> 44:29.741
It's your share.

44:31.327 --> 44:33.245
Pass.

44:35.289 --> 44:38.917
- Come on, man, try it. Let it out.
- Come on, John.

44:39.085 --> 44:40.377
I don't have nothing.

44:40.545 --> 44:43.088
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.

44:43.256 --> 44:44.548
- It's cool, man.
- Come on.

44:44.715 --> 44:45.966
- Come on.
- Do it.

44:46.133 --> 44:47.467
First time for everything.

44:47.635 --> 44:50.846
- Feels good to release, now.
- Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.

44:51.013 --> 44:54.474
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?

44:56.102 --> 45:01.022
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.

45:04.068 --> 45:05.527
All right. Thanks for sharing.

45:06.487 --> 45:08.530
- Okay.
- Thank you.

45:08.781 --> 45:10.323
- All right.
- That's awesome.

45:10.491 --> 45:13.535
- That's a clap. Yeah.
- There you go. Good share.

45:29.010 --> 45:31.344
Hey, Hancock.

45:31.512 --> 45:33.430
Come on, get up.

45:33.598 --> 45:36.641
- You got a phone call.
- Take a message.

45:36.809 --> 45:39.019
It's the chief of police.

45:39.186 --> 45:41.605
He says he needs your help.

46:06.923 --> 46:10.425
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

46:10.593 --> 46:12.427
...who was killed last year in Iraq...

46:12.595 --> 46:16.056
...leaving her two small children.
We are waiting for the latest news...

46:16.223 --> 46:18.808
...but apparently
there are three suspects and...

46:18.976 --> 46:20.226
What's going on?

46:22.063 --> 46:23.229
I'm out!

46:23.898 --> 46:26.524
Stay down! Stay down!

46:26.692 --> 46:28.401
Stay down!

46:29.070 --> 46:30.153
- Get out!
- Get down!

46:30.321 --> 46:31.488
Get it down!

46:36.869 --> 46:39.621
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

46:39.789 --> 46:42.082
Back! Move!

46:54.887 --> 46:58.473
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.

46:58.641 --> 47:00.475
The west side is open.

47:09.110 --> 47:11.695
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.

47:19.870 --> 47:21.538
What?

47:26.002 --> 47:27.669
It's a little tight. What you got?

47:27.837 --> 47:31.840
Bank job. I got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.

47:32.008 --> 47:34.175
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

47:34.343 --> 47:38.304
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And...

47:38.472 --> 47:41.891
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty caliber or bigger.

47:42.059 --> 47:45.729
- I don't know if that matters to you.
- No, I'm good.

47:52.236 --> 47:56.990
Good job.

47:57.283 --> 47:59.284
Really, good job.

48:07.126 --> 48:08.251
Get down!

48:37.948 --> 48:39.741
It's Hancock!

48:47.249 --> 48:48.374
Take him out!

48:52.963 --> 48:54.923
Good job!

48:54.924 --> 48:57.092
Do I have permission
to touch your body?

48:57.259 --> 48:58.802
Yes!

49:00.179 --> 49:02.347
It's not sexual.

49:03.849 --> 49:06.059
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

49:06.227 --> 49:09.062
- You're a very attractive woman...
- Get me the f%

49:14.485 --> 49:16.194
He's on the move!

49:30.459 --> 49:32.502
He's moving, he's moving!

49:42.304 --> 49:43.346
Good job.

49:43.514 --> 49:44.973
- Are you hit anywhere?
- My leg!

49:45.141 --> 49:46.683
- Hancock!
- Good job.

49:46.851 --> 49:49.227
You said that.
I need you to end this now.

49:57.820 --> 49:59.445
Check the flanks.

50:01.740 --> 50:02.907
Secure the perimeter.

50:06.787 --> 50:08.371
Spread out!

50:08.539 --> 50:10.582
They're gonna
come around the back.

50:23.721 --> 50:24.762
What happened to him?

50:26.599 --> 50:29.642
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

50:35.441 --> 50:38.318
What is happening?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.835
- I heard you was in the slammer.
- Out early.

50:56.003 --> 50:58.671
- Why's that?
- Good behavior.

50:59.590 --> 51:01.174
Do you know what this is?

51:04.470 --> 51:08.765
I'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.

51:08.933 --> 51:12.310
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

51:12.478 --> 51:14.562
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

51:14.730 --> 51:16.356
If my thumb comes off it:

51:19.568 --> 51:22.862
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...

51:23.030 --> 51:27.200
...between the police showing up and
you sucking out all of my associates...

51:27.368 --> 51:29.535
...I want you to break into the vault.

51:29.828 --> 51:32.956
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.

51:33.332 --> 51:34.707
Thirty million dollars.

51:35.751 --> 51:37.627
And you're gonna carry it for me.

51:37.795 --> 51:41.798
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...

51:42.007 --> 51:46.302
...or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.

51:49.431 --> 51:51.307
I'm gonna have to say no to that.

51:54.395 --> 51:56.396
I'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.

51:56.563 --> 51:59.273
I will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.

52:02.403 --> 52:04.737
I really don't like that word.

52:04.905 --> 52:06.864
I will blow them sky-high...

52:07.032 --> 52:09.742
...and their blood
will be on your hands.

52:13.288 --> 52:15.415
Do you hear me, asshole?

52:24.091 --> 52:26.592
Call me a asshole...

52:26.969 --> 52:28.469
...one more time.

52:31.432 --> 52:33.307
Ass...

52:38.188 --> 52:40.523
- Go, go, go. Move in!
- Go on, you're safe!

52:40.691 --> 52:43.109
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Take it right in. Let's go.

52:43.277 --> 52:45.319
Bring it around now.

53:06.759 --> 53:08.468
Keep your hand on that trigger.

53:10.220 --> 53:12.680
- Good job.
- No. You, good job.

53:14.975 --> 53:17.018
- Thank you.
- Good job.

53:18.687 --> 53:21.105
Hancock!

54:15.494 --> 54:18.412
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

54:19.164 --> 54:20.706
Here we go. This way.

54:20.874 --> 54:24.460
- Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
- Thank you.

54:24.628 --> 54:26.420
Smile.

54:26.630 --> 54:27.713
Good job, Hancock!

54:30.259 --> 54:32.301
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here,
huh?

54:32.469 --> 54:36.430
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

54:36.598 --> 54:38.099
Gigantic fans. Insane!

54:38.267 --> 54:40.518
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

54:40.686 --> 54:42.019
You never call, man.

54:42.187 --> 54:46.232
- I have called. A couple of times.
- Water under the bridge, man.

54:49.194 --> 54:52.238
Could you guys
get used to this or what?

54:54.158 --> 54:55.867
How'd you two meet?

54:57.744 --> 54:59.328
I was married once before.

54:59.496 --> 55:01.581
First wife...

55:02.708 --> 55:05.543
...she died giving birth to Aaron.

55:06.128 --> 55:10.423
It's another dinner. But... But...

55:10.632 --> 55:13.176
So there I am, I'm with
this beautiful little baby.

55:13.343 --> 55:15.136
I don't know what the hell to do.

55:15.304 --> 55:17.555
And I was in the supermarket...

55:18.265 --> 55:20.183
...and I'm in the baby aisle...

55:20.350 --> 55:22.935
...and I've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.

55:23.103 --> 55:27.064
I'm staring at them, but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.

55:28.358 --> 55:29.525
An angel...

55:30.903 --> 55:33.070
...sees me.

55:34.865 --> 55:37.700
She knew. She was...
She gave me this look.

55:39.244 --> 55:44.290
And even in the trance I was in,
I knew that somebody somewhere...

55:44.458 --> 55:46.500
...was throwing me a little rope.

55:47.252 --> 55:48.336
You know?

55:48.503 --> 55:52.506
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?

55:53.675 --> 55:57.637
- You're drunk.
- So? Come here.

56:02.893 --> 56:04.477
What about you, buddy?

56:04.645 --> 56:06.604
You're from another planet,
aren't you?

56:07.564 --> 56:08.940
No, man, I'm from Miami.

56:09.107 --> 56:11.484
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or...?

56:11.652 --> 56:14.237
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing I remember.

56:14.404 --> 56:18.407
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and...

56:18.742 --> 56:22.370
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

56:23.080 --> 56:25.957
- Come on.
- My skull was fractured.

56:26.124 --> 56:29.752
They told me
I tried to stop a mugging.

56:29.920 --> 56:34.173
- Somebody knocked you out.
- I guess I was a regular guy before...

56:34.341 --> 56:37.593
...and when I woke up,
I was changed.

56:38.762 --> 56:41.347
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...

56:41.515 --> 56:43.808
...and it just broke against my skin.

56:43.976 --> 56:47.687
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.

56:47.854 --> 56:51.440
The doctors were astounded...

56:51.608 --> 56:55.403
...and they wanted to know my story.

56:55.570 --> 56:59.323
Just like you. But I couldn't tell them.
I don't know who I am.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.159
Amnesia.

57:02.577 --> 57:06.247
- You know, the blow to the head.
- Yeah, well, that's what they figured.

57:06.707 --> 57:10.126
- You don't remember anything?
- No.

57:11.253 --> 57:14.088
Only thing I had in my pocket was...

57:14.256 --> 57:16.215
...bubble-gum...

57:16.383 --> 57:18.509
...two movie tickets.

57:18.677 --> 57:22.305
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein.

57:22.806 --> 57:25.725
But no ID, nothing.

57:25.892 --> 57:30.604
I went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

57:32.441 --> 57:34.233
I actually thought that's who I was.

57:35.402 --> 57:37.111
How come I didn't hear any of this...

57:37.279 --> 57:39.238
...didn't read about it
in any newspapers?

57:39.406 --> 57:42.783
It was probably in the papers
80 years ago.

57:43.327 --> 57:44.827
Eighty years ago?

57:45.037 --> 57:47.288
Oh, I don't age. This is it.

57:47.456 --> 57:50.291
- That's nice.
- Gotta wonder, though:

57:52.669 --> 57:55.963
What kind of bastard
must I have been...

57:59.593 --> 58:01.802
...that nobody was there to claim me?

58:06.350 --> 58:10.478
I mean, I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

58:10.645 --> 58:13.064
...so I've been told, but...

58:15.275 --> 58:17.151
...nobody?

58:31.833 --> 58:34.293
Whoever it was they'd be dead
by now, anyway.

58:36.296 --> 58:37.630
Hey.

58:37.798 --> 58:40.591
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?

58:40.759 --> 58:44.512
Yeah. Too much wine.

58:44.763 --> 58:47.139
I am a lightweight.

58:53.146 --> 58:55.189
I'm sorry.

58:58.693 --> 59:00.694
You ain't do nothing.

59:05.492 --> 59:06.992
This was a nice dinner, Ray.

59:09.788 --> 59:13.874
- It was a good one.
- Almost call this fun.

59:18.672 --> 59:20.923
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?

59:21.091 --> 59:23.217
- Not really.
- I'm real spinny.

59:23.385 --> 59:26.303
Could've just flown me upstairs.

59:26.471 --> 59:29.140
- I could've done without that.
- Get your shoes off here.

59:29.307 --> 59:32.685
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.

59:35.814 --> 59:38.649
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?

59:39.317 --> 59:41.944
- Of course, Ray. I believe in you.
- Help me up here.

59:42.112 --> 59:44.155
I got something to say to you.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.783
Listen to me. This is important.

59:49.578 --> 59:53.080
You are like a Dodger Dog.

59:53.623 --> 59:55.958
It's something people don't think
they're gonna like...

59:56.126 --> 59:58.627
...then they try it and they love it,
right? It hits the spot.

59:58.795 --> 01:00:01.672
It's good for the soul.
You're like the world's Dodger Dog.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.008
I don't know.
But you know what I mean, right?

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.512
You're gonna do great.

01:00:11.016 --> 01:00:12.850
You're gonna fix everything.

01:00:17.063 --> 01:00:20.858
- You get some sleep, Ray.
- You sleep tight too.

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:24.111
Hancock tucking me in.

01:00:35.916 --> 01:00:38.250
All right, he's asleep.

01:00:42.297 --> 01:00:45.508
- Okay, thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

01:00:51.431 --> 01:00:56.519
Look, I just don't want you
to think that... That Ray...

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.562
...you know, drinks like that,
because...

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.981
- Oh, no.
- This was just kind of...

01:01:01.149 --> 01:01:03.108
...a celebratory night.
- No, I understand.

01:01:03.276 --> 01:01:06.278
- Yeah, I know that.
- Okay.

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:12.660
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:33.597
You have a bruise on your hand.

01:01:33.765 --> 01:01:36.850
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know what that is.

01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:41.063
I've been feeling kind of funny.

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.902
You...

01:01:47.862 --> 01:01:49.196
You should go.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.787
Getting late.

01:02:48.048 --> 01:02:49.548
If Ray finds out about me...

01:02:51.885 --> 01:02:53.761
...you're dead.

01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:44.478
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.

01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:48.315
Hi, honey.

01:03:48.483 --> 01:03:50.484
Breakfast?

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:53.487
Hancock sneezed, huh?

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:56.824
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.

01:03:56.991 --> 01:03:59.827
- You're a good sleeper.
- Holy shit.

01:04:00.161 --> 01:04:03.455
I'm not gonna say
I told you so, but...

01:04:03.998 --> 01:04:06.709
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

01:04:06.918 --> 01:04:08.335
I just said him being around...

01:04:08.503 --> 01:04:10.713
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.

01:04:10.922 --> 01:04:13.340
- Oh, God, you strong man.
- I got it.

01:04:13.508 --> 01:04:15.801
But you don't worry about anything.

01:04:15.969 --> 01:04:19.304
I already apologized to the neighbors.
Called State Farm.

01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:20.931
Everything is taken care of.

01:04:21.641 --> 01:04:23.350
You just...

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:27.438
...enjoy that breakfast.

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:32.025
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?

01:04:32.193 --> 01:04:33.402
Just the three of us.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.028
- End of the summer?
- Tonight.

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:37.364
- Tonight?
- Spur of the moment.

01:04:37.532 --> 01:04:41.034
- Tonight might be a little tough.
- Come on. The three of us?

01:04:41.202 --> 01:04:43.078
Me in a bikini?

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.788
- Sounds good.
- Let's go somewhere.

01:04:44.956 --> 01:04:48.292
Knock, knock.

01:04:48.293 --> 01:04:50.169
Gesundheit.

01:04:50.879 --> 01:04:55.382
I was just telling Ray here,
I hope you're done sneezing...

01:04:55.550 --> 01:05:00.846
...because I don't think our house could
take much more of your sneezing.

01:05:07.061 --> 01:05:11.106
Yeah, sometimes
I sneeze when there's dust...

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.736
...or if I get really surprised.

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:20.073
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

01:05:20.909 --> 01:05:23.327
Mike? How you doing?

01:05:23.995 --> 01:05:26.455
It was great to see you too.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:29.833
Yep. Well...

01:05:30.043 --> 01:05:32.419
Right. Go ahead, shoot.

01:05:33.713 --> 01:05:36.632
Okay. I got a pen right here.

01:05:36.925 --> 01:05:39.635
Right. No, I know.

01:05:44.682 --> 01:05:46.850
It's right here in my hand.

01:05:54.359 --> 01:05:56.443
I am warning you.

01:05:56.611 --> 01:05:57.861
All right, go ahead.

01:06:01.407 --> 01:06:02.533
Okay, good.

01:06:03.451 --> 01:06:08.080
Now... And that's still in 310, right?

01:06:08.248 --> 01:06:09.414
Hang on one second.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:11.542
Do me a favor...?

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:15.712
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.756
We're gonna talk.

01:06:17.924 --> 01:06:20.842
Go away.

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:24.930
Well, it is something
that I'm really excited about.

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:39.403
- I'm gonna do this all day.
- Shut... Shut up.

01:06:41.781 --> 01:06:43.282
I... I suppose...

01:06:43.449 --> 01:06:45.784
- Fine. We'll talk, okay?
- We will.

01:06:45.994 --> 01:06:50.831
And when we're done talking, you
go away and you leave my family alone.

01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:55.043
- My place at 4:00.
- Whatever.

01:06:56.004 --> 01:06:59.423
It means... Well, I'd rather not
talk numbers now.

01:06:59.591 --> 01:07:02.676
I'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.

01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:05.887
That's good with me.
I will see you then. All right.

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:08.974
Yeah, 3:30. Great.

01:07:09.267 --> 01:07:11.727
Hon, is it hot in here?

01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:36.168
He hurt you, didn't he?

01:07:37.128 --> 01:07:39.671
Come on, use your words.

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:42.382
How did it make you feel?

01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:46.428
Sore.

01:07:47.138 --> 01:07:50.349
Bad.

01:07:50.516 --> 01:07:54.728
It's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.

01:07:56.230 --> 01:08:00.651
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

01:08:00.818 --> 01:08:02.944
You understand me?

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.573
We're gonna go find Hancock...

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:10.535
...and get your power back.

01:08:41.901 --> 01:08:43.234
Well, I'm here.

01:08:44.237 --> 01:08:45.779
Yup.

01:08:51.452 --> 01:08:54.787
- You wanna do it?
- Do what?

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.627
I don't have time for this, okay?
You ask the questions...

01:09:00.795 --> 01:09:02.754
...I answer them honestly
and then you leave L.A.

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:04.506
I ain't leaving L.A.

01:09:07.051 --> 01:09:10.095
All right, all right. Jeez.

01:09:12.223 --> 01:09:13.724
Don't.

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:27.654
Ask.

01:09:29.615 --> 01:09:31.323
- You and I.
- "You and I" what?

01:09:31.492 --> 01:09:34.243
- We're the same.
- No.

01:09:35.078 --> 01:09:36.580
I'm stronger.

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:38.790
Really?

01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:43.336
Oh, yeah.

01:09:44.505 --> 01:09:46.173
Who are we?

01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:51.136
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

01:09:51.304 --> 01:09:54.347
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."

01:09:54.515 --> 01:09:58.143
- Are there more of us?
- There were.

01:09:58.478 --> 01:09:59.644
They all died.

01:10:01.689 --> 01:10:03.815
It's just the two of us.

01:10:12.825 --> 01:10:13.950
What is this?

01:10:17.955 --> 01:10:19.539
Who are we to each other?

01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:22.709
- We're brother and sister.
- That's a lie.

01:10:24.212 --> 01:10:25.962
- No, I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:27.839
- I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

01:10:28.007 --> 01:10:31.134
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.

01:10:31.302 --> 01:10:32.636
You're lying, deal's off.

01:10:32.804 --> 01:10:34.888
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:37.224
Get your ass back here!

01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:39.309
I'm telling!

01:10:44.649 --> 01:10:47.067
The AllHeart symbol
will be known globally...

01:10:47.735 --> 01:10:49.236
...as a symbol...

01:10:49.403 --> 01:10:54.282
...that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.910
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?

01:10:57.078 --> 01:10:59.371
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.

01:10:59.539 --> 01:11:01.957
- We were talking about Hancock...
- Number two.

01:11:13.261 --> 01:11:15.053
You stay away
from me and my family.

01:11:15.221 --> 01:11:17.639
You are not gonna
do this to me again.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.851
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:11:21.018 --> 01:11:22.978
- Hey!
- I love you, Hancock!

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:26.648
It can't work.
It always ends the same way.

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.317
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:31.278
Brooklyn?
I've never been to Brooklyn.

01:11:31.571 --> 01:11:34.155
I have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:36.241
...and I am done!
Done, you listening?

01:11:36.409 --> 01:11:39.703
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Finally, I am happy!

01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:43.498
- You are not gonna mess with that!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:46.167
I hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:51.006
...but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.388
Call me crazy...

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:01.766
...one more time.

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:03.351
Cuckoo.

01:12:12.653 --> 01:12:14.154
All right, hold it. All right.

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:17.490
You better not hit me with that truck.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.995
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global...

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:23.788
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

01:12:23.956 --> 01:12:25.916
They're committed
to bettering the world.

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:28.543
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they...

01:13:11.212 --> 01:13:14.089
The most important thing
with AllHeart is brand recognition.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.216
I've mocked up
these examples here...

01:13:16.384 --> 01:13:18.385
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.

01:13:30.106 --> 01:13:31.856
Oh, no.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.401
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra...

01:13:34.568 --> 01:13:35.610
Is it snowing?

01:13:50.418 --> 01:13:52.085
Stop. Stop it.

01:13:52.253 --> 01:13:55.046
Stop. Stop. Stop!
All right, let's just...

01:13:55.214 --> 01:14:04.723
Get off me!

01:14:05.599 --> 01:14:07.100
Stop. Stop!

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:08.893
Get off!

01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:10.311
- Get off me!
- Listen to me!

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:12.939
- I hate you!
- I am sorry!

01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:20.947
Whoever I am, whatever I did...
Look at me.

01:14:21.866 --> 01:14:23.867
- I'm sorry.

01:14:24.285 --> 01:14:26.327
I don't remember.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.664
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

01:14:40.217 --> 01:14:42.010
Oh, my God.

01:15:32.478 --> 01:15:35.772
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.

01:15:36.857 --> 01:15:39.692
- Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
- Okay, I was flying.

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.446
And I'm very strong as well.

01:15:43.614 --> 01:15:45.156
- It's just the way we are.
- "We"?

01:15:45.324 --> 01:15:48.409
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:51.496
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.

01:15:51.664 --> 01:15:54.290
- You were at his trailer.
- This is hard to explain.

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:55.875
- Great, I'm all ears.
- Me too.

01:15:56.043 --> 01:15:58.837
Do me a favor, just give me
and my wife one moment.

01:15:59.004 --> 01:16:01.464
- Don't bring it here, Ray.
- The adults are talking.

01:16:01.632 --> 01:16:03.299
Technically speaking...

01:16:05.177 --> 01:16:06.344
...he's my husband.

01:16:07.513 --> 01:16:09.973
Holy shit.

01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:13.184
- What?
- We broke up decades ago.

01:16:13.352 --> 01:16:16.312
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.607
But you can, right? You knew?

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.277
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:25.738
"I don't like to travel.
I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."

01:16:25.906 --> 01:16:28.324
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

01:16:28.492 --> 01:16:32.412
Whatever we are, we were built in twos,
okay? We're drawn to each other.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.956
No matter how far I run,
he's always there.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:36.749
He finds me. It's physics.

01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:39.627
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:42.714
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.841
And the one thing I learned...

01:16:45.009 --> 01:16:47.802
...fate doesn't decide everything.

01:16:48.345 --> 01:16:49.762
People get to choose.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:52.223
And you chose...

01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:55.727
...to let me think I was here alone.

01:17:05.237 --> 01:17:07.822
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

01:17:09.408 --> 01:17:11.743
Great. Now what?

01:17:16.957 --> 01:17:19.375
I didn't plan for this.

01:17:42.232 --> 01:17:43.733
Prison authorities confirmed...

01:17:43.901 --> 01:17:47.612
...that the prisoner uprising
was led by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:51.115
...who was also the leader of last
week's Spring Street bank robbery.

01:17:51.283 --> 01:17:53.618
At least eight prisoners
are not accounted for.

01:17:53.786 --> 01:17:56.079
More information
on the prison riot in Norwalk.

01:17:56.246 --> 01:17:59.499
Construction workers at the prison
were knocked unconscious.

01:17:59.667 --> 01:18:01.709
The prisoners stole
the workers' clothes...

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:04.587
...and it's feared at least
some of them have escaped.

01:18:04.755 --> 01:18:07.006
Parker is considered
a criminal mastermind.

01:18:07.174 --> 01:18:09.884
He is very effective at
using psychological persuasion...

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:12.553
...to organize criminals
from different backgrounds.

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:15.682
He is a former psychology professor
from Stanford University.

01:18:15.849 --> 01:18:18.559
While there, he organized
a notorious criminal network...

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:21.104
...comprised of graduate students
from diverse...

01:18:21.271 --> 01:18:23.356
Ninety-one ten.

01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:25.858
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.

01:18:26.318 --> 01:18:27.735
Ninety-one ten.

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:30.321
Highway robbery.

01:18:54.179 --> 01:18:56.597
- What?
- I'm taking the money.

01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:04.647
I can relate to that.

01:19:07.067 --> 01:19:09.902
You know? If you want something...

01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:13.865
...nobody can stop you
from taking it...

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:17.201
...you just take it, right?

01:19:18.871 --> 01:19:20.747
I like that.

01:19:21.915 --> 01:19:23.124
But can you take it?

01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:29.172
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.680
Sorry about your window.

01:20:25.062 --> 01:20:26.854
- I need Room 1020.
- Clear!

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.523
I need Room 1020.

01:20:31.819 --> 01:20:35.947
I need IV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...

01:20:36.115 --> 01:20:37.657
Where's his IV line?

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.159
- That's not gonna work.
- I'm in.

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.079
What's happening?

01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:48.960
This just in.
John Hancock has been rushed...

01:20:49.128 --> 01:20:50.878
...to Los Angeles General Hospital.

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:54.257
Hancock is in serious condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.

01:20:54.424 --> 01:20:56.592
No story yet as to
how this happened to him...

01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.763
...but we will continue to cover this
story live. Reporting live from L.A...

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:09.981
- Any lead on the assailant?
- Mr. Embrey!

01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:14.152
- Just a couple of questions, sir, please.
- Can you describe how it happened?

01:21:14.319 --> 01:21:17.697
From what I've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.

01:21:17.865 --> 01:21:21.492
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:22.827
Not that I'm aware of.

01:21:22.995 --> 01:21:25.413
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:28.332
- He was seen battling her.
- I do not have that answer.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.669
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?

01:21:34.548 --> 01:21:37.425
Here are the lab results for 209.

01:22:05.162 --> 01:22:06.996
You're becoming mortal.

01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:10.499
It's us...

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.169
...being close to each other.

01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:17.089
It's never happened this fast before.

01:22:19.676 --> 01:22:21.052
You have to leave.

01:22:22.387 --> 01:22:25.181
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.

01:22:25.349 --> 01:22:27.975
You'll start getting
your powers back...

01:22:28.185 --> 01:22:31.020
...and be flying and breaking things...

01:22:31.188 --> 01:22:33.814
...and saving people
before you know it.

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:52.583
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.

01:22:52.751 --> 01:22:57.713
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.

01:22:59.925 --> 01:23:04.470
- Why?
- So we can live human lives.

01:23:04.805 --> 01:23:07.515
Love, connect...

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:12.645
...grow old, die.

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:16.524
What happened to us?

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:22.822
Summer of 4 B.C.

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:26.909
We were becoming mortal, like now.

01:23:27.411 --> 01:23:29.620
They came after me with swords.

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:35.084
But you saved me.

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:41.090
1850.

01:23:41.508 --> 01:23:43.467
They set our house on fire.

01:23:44.594 --> 01:23:47.513
You pulled me out of the flames.

01:23:49.599 --> 01:23:51.934
Eighty years ago.

01:23:52.853 --> 01:23:55.021
What happened then?

01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:58.232
We were living in Miami...

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:02.153
...and a new movie
was playing in town.

01:24:02.321 --> 01:24:03.404
Frankenstein.

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:08.826
And after...

01:24:09.286 --> 01:24:11.120
...we walked down Flagler Street...

01:24:11.288 --> 01:24:15.249
...and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.

01:24:21.673 --> 01:24:24.633
And they attacked us in an alley.

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:32.558
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

01:24:33.602 --> 01:24:36.979
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

01:24:37.898 --> 01:24:42.693
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:48.366
But you didn't know me.

01:24:50.869 --> 01:24:53.079
So I left.

01:24:54.206 --> 01:24:57.041
Every time we're together...

01:24:57.542 --> 01:25:00.002
...they come after you through me.

01:25:13.683 --> 01:25:17.853
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

01:25:18.021 --> 01:25:20.940
That's who you are. You're a hero.

01:25:22.526 --> 01:25:25.236
The insurance policy of the gods.

01:25:25.779 --> 01:25:28.989
Keep one alive. You.

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:32.451
To protect this world.

01:25:48.552 --> 01:25:49.593
Mary!

01:25:52.389 --> 01:25:53.431
Mom!

01:25:53.598 --> 01:25:54.974
- Mary!
- Stay down!

01:25:56.101 --> 01:25:57.601
Okay.

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:09.280
Mary?

01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:24.211
Stop.

01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:28.966
Oh, no! No! Please!

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:40.436
Stay down.

01:26:52.199 --> 01:26:53.991
Hey! Mary!

01:26:54.159 --> 01:26:55.701
Let's go, get her up!

01:26:56.703 --> 01:26:59.371
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.

01:27:06.004 --> 01:27:08.422
- Morphine.
- Here. Help in here!

01:27:09.716 --> 01:27:11.342
Hold her down. Hold her down.

01:27:15.388 --> 01:27:25.189
Hold her down.

01:27:33.490 --> 01:27:35.699
- You want the monitor now?
- Stay calm.

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:55.010
- Hold her, hold her, hold her.
- Need EKG leads.

01:28:29.379 --> 01:28:32.506
Upon us all, Hancock.

01:28:33.216 --> 01:28:34.633
You're no different.

01:28:39.264 --> 01:28:42.641
Time to shut her down, Hancock.

01:28:42.809 --> 01:28:45.060
It's been a nice run.

01:29:13.465 --> 01:29:17.426
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.

01:29:19.262 --> 01:29:21.221
But it is time for you to move on.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.103
And maybe to a happier place.

01:29:30.106 --> 01:29:32.608
You can thank me if you want to...

01:29:33.777 --> 01:29:35.402
...superhero.

01:29:45.789 --> 01:29:47.414
You didn't!

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:54.880
Aaron!

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:10.200
- What about Attila the Hun?
- Completely cross-eyed.

01:33:10.368 --> 01:33:11.451
- Cross-eyed?
- Yep.

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:14.413
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?

01:33:14.581 --> 01:33:18.250
- Needy.
- J.F.K? What about him?

01:33:18.835 --> 01:33:21.295
Oh, yeah.

01:33:22.255 --> 01:33:24.673
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?

01:33:24.841 --> 01:33:27.593
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.844
Yeah, hang on.

01:33:30.889 --> 01:33:33.140
- Hello?
- Ray.

01:33:33.308 --> 01:33:35.267
Hey, I've been trying to call you.

01:33:35.435 --> 01:33:38.186
Yeah, I was out of cell range.

01:33:39.022 --> 01:33:42.733
- Are you outside?
- Yeah.

01:33:42.901 --> 01:33:46.361
- Look up.
- All right, I'm looking up.

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.947
I'm looking up.

01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:57.164
- Baby?
- What?

01:34:04.589 --> 01:34:06.757
You're gonna change the world.

01:34:06.925 --> 01:34:10.344
- Good job, Ray.
- Oh, my God, Ray.

01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:14.056
Hey. Look up.

01:34:14.766 --> 01:34:16.224
Hancock.

01:34:20.772 --> 01:34:22.564
I'm proud of you.

01:34:22.732 --> 01:34:24.566
Thanks.

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:29.154
Will I get in trouble for that?

01:35:45.398 --> 01:35:47.691
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

01:35:47.859 --> 01:35:50.027
- Oh, my God! Sam! No!
- Drop your weapon, sir!

01:35:50.194 --> 01:35:51.611
Get back! Get back! Get back!

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:54.281
- Drop it!
- Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!

01:35:54.449 --> 01:35:56.074
Get back! I'm not playing.

01:35:56.492 --> 01:35:59.286
Get back. Get back!

01:35:59.704 --> 01:36:01.997
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?

01:36:02.165 --> 01:36:04.332
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.835
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

01:36:07.003 --> 01:36:09.254
- All right.
- Tell them to take the guns off me.

01:36:09.422 --> 01:36:11.256
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

01:36:11.424 --> 01:36:15.761
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

01:36:16.179 --> 01:36:18.597
Now let's make it happen, asshole.
