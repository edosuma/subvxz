01:40.760 --> 01:43.399
2130, day 547.

01:43.480 --> 01:46.950
Unscheduled course correction
due at 2200.

01:47.040 --> 01:51.238
Pre-correction check:
Rotation axis plus three degrees.

01:51.320 --> 01:56.189
Nitrous oxide pressure:
4,100, rising to 5,000.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.033
Quad jets C and D
on pre-select.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.351
Rotor ignition sequence
beginning in 3-0.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.908
Thruster line reactors
on standby.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.150
Vincent, notify me with 15 to go.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.559
- Alex?
- Yes, Dan.

02:08.639 --> 02:11.916
Have you determined the difference
in ETAs with and without our correction?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.788
Working on it. You know, we shouldn't
be needing a direction at this time.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.156
Vincent, run a confirmation
on the last inertial fix...

02:19.240 --> 02:21.310
and check it
with another celestial, please.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.516
I have.
It is correct...

02:23.600 --> 02:27.036
but I think I've found the reason
for our present variation.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.270
- Mr Pizer.
- Yes, Vincent.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.920
Mr Pizer, I think
you should come up here.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.908
What's up, Vincent?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.039
The largest black hole
I have ever encountered, Mr Pizer.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.111
Hmm. Let's have a look at it
on the holograph.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.676
My God!

03:07.760 --> 03:10.672
Right out of Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

03:10.760 --> 03:14.753
Yes. The most destructive force
in the universe, Harry.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.070
Nothing can escape it,
not even light.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.674
I had a professor who predicted
that eventually black holes...

03:19.760 --> 03:22.672
would devour
the entire universe.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.231
Why not, when you can see giant suns
sucked in and disappear without a trace?

03:28.320 --> 03:31.357
- Give us the magnification, Vincent.
- Polarizing image.

03:31.440 --> 03:35.877
Every time I see one of those things,
I expect to spot some guy in red
with horns and a pitchfork.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.109
It's a monster, all right.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.953
A rip in the very fabric
of space and time...

03:40.040 --> 03:41.951
but I picked up
something else of interest.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.157
- Let's see it.
- It hasn't moved
since I first picked it up.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.708
- It seems to be some kind of ship.
- Do you copy, Alex?

03:47.800 --> 03:51.998
- <i>Roger, Dan.</i>
- Enlarge again, Vincent,
and let's try to identify it.

03:56.280 --> 03:59.795
But how could anybody
be out here ahead of us?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.189
Arcturius-10, <i>United Kingdom.</i>

04:04.320 --> 04:06.117
Liberty-7, <i>United States.</i>

04:07.840 --> 04:10.195
<i>Russian experimental space station,</i>
<i>series five.</i>

04:11.760 --> 04:14.149
<i>France,</i> Sahara Module 5-3.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.753
Pluto-4, <i>Japan.</i>

04:16.920 --> 04:18.956
<i>United States,</i>
Space Probe One.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.553
- That's it.
- USS Cygnus.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.552
<i>Dr Kate, wasn't that the ship</i>
<i>your father was on?</i>

04:24.640 --> 04:26.551
<i>USS Cygnus.</i>

04:26.640 --> 04:31.714
Its mission: To discover habitable
life in outer space. Same as ours.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.711
Signal that ship, Vincent.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.154
- Activate the sensors, Charlie.
- You bet.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.311
They were recalled to Earth
20 years ago...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.914
their mission
considered a failure.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.958
How that must have galled
Dr Hans Reinhardt.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.474
Did you ever meet
Commander Reinhardt?

04:54.680 --> 04:57.478
Collided with him would be
a more accurate description.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.028
- A legend.
- So he believed.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.589
Reinhardt had the knack
of making his own ambitions...

05:03.680 --> 05:06.877
seem like a matter
of national pride.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.155
Why, he talked
the space appropriations committee...

05:09.240 --> 05:11.708
into the costliest fiasco
of all time...

05:11.800 --> 05:13.711
and refused to admit failure.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.552
He ignored his recall.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.393
Maybe not.
Maybe it never got through.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.675
That ship just...
just disappeared.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.070
They've never been seen again.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.233
Dan, get us in close enough. Vincent
and I could get aboard on tethers.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.278
To quote Cicero, "Rashness is
the characteristic of youth...

05:31.360 --> 05:35.592
prudence that of mellowed age and
discretion the better part of valour."

05:35.680 --> 05:39.719
No sense leaving the story
of a lifetime untold, Captain.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.870
<i>I believe there is, Harry...</i>

05:41.960 --> 05:44.155
and it's looking
straight at us.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.832
Picking up anything
on the sensors, Charlie?

05:45.920 --> 05:47.512
Negative, but with all
that turbulence...

05:47.600 --> 05:50.034
<i>out there, our signal</i>
<i>might not be getting through.</i>

05:50.120 --> 05:52.350
According to my instruments,
it hasn't moved a centimetre...

05:52.440 --> 05:54.431
since we first spotted it.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.195
But, Alex, how can a lifeless derelict
defy that kind of gravity?

05:58.280 --> 06:00.794
I don't know, but it's
certainly worth investigating.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.552
<i>My instincts</i>
<i>are against it, Alex...</i>

06:02.640 --> 06:05.029
but we'll go in
for a closer look.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.918
Fix a coordinate approach, Charlie.
Full power on the thrusters, Vincent.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.957
Strap yourselves in. We'll be feeling
the gravitational force...

06:23.240 --> 06:25.231
right now.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.716
Range: 29551 and closing.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.551
What's your reading
on <i>Cygnus,</i> Vincent?

06:55.640 --> 06:58.552
Triangulation shows
it's still holding steady, sir.

06:58.640 --> 07:03.156
- Gravity pull?
- .02450 and rising.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.631
Puts us in an escape attitude of
8-5 degrees. Cut power by two-thirds.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.754
- 8-5 degrees.
She's bucking like a bronco.
- Gravity?

07:19.840 --> 07:22.035
.46960, still climbing.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.190
Switching to manual.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.999
Captain, I'm not sure how long
the engines will remain operable...

07:27.080 --> 07:29.150
against that much force
when we turn back.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.151
Alex, gravity's close to maximum.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.629
We can afford one pass, and then we're
gonna have to get the hell out.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.913
- Zero gravity.
- Cut the power.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.831
Smooth as glass.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.156
It's like being
in the eye of a hurricane.

08:13.400 --> 08:17.075
- What happened?
- Natural phenomenon.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.712
Or something from that ship.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.912
Activating the microbeam.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.276
Picking up anything, Charlie?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.153
Negative, Alex. No way our signals
can't get through this time.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.233
- Gravity's at maximum, Dan.
- My God, I think it's got us.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.232
We're starting to tumble.
Hundred percent on the roll jet quads.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.751
Roll jet quads, full capacity.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.078
- Air break at midship. Losing oxygen.
- Charlie...

10:10.160 --> 10:12.799
give me a full burst
at 180 degrees, main thrusters.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.149
We got a break here too!

10:23.240 --> 10:26.437
Emergency readouts show the primary
and secondary air lines ruptured!

10:27.640 --> 10:30.074
Never rains.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.469
Full-pitch attitude thrusters,
A and B rings.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.471
The black hole
is pulling us in.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.551
Going to manual.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.828
The number four hatch blew outward,
Captain. I'll go out and secure it.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.708
Watch yourself out there, Vincent.
There's more gravity pull
than we've ever encountered.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.313
Yes, sir.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.596
Alex, we'd better check out
the damage below!

11:36.360 --> 11:40.512
Vincent, do you read me?
Come in, Vincent.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.830
Kate, either we have
a malfunction here...

11:42.920 --> 11:44.911
or there's too much interference
on the outside.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.911
See if you can get through
to Vincent with your ESP.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.911
I got through to Vincent.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.479
He said there are old pilots
and there are bold pilots...

12:02.560 --> 12:05.518
but there are very few
old, bold pilots.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.630
She's tuned in on Vincent,
all right.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.708
Grab my leg! My leg!

12:15.280 --> 12:17.191
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.229
And that's got it!

12:21.320 --> 12:23.914
Hit the boosters, Charlie. We gotta
make a run for that zero gravity.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.356
He secured the hatch!

12:48.440 --> 12:49.793
Good.

12:49.880 --> 12:54.556
<i>We can only make temporary repairs</i>
<i>here, Dan, and that's only</i>
<i>to the secondary line.</i>

12:54.640 --> 12:57.154
Unless we can replace the damaged parts
in the main regulator...

12:57.240 --> 12:59.549
we're gonna lose
our oxygen supply.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.551
Damn!

13:06.640 --> 13:10.076
Dan, the tether's broken.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.993
- I'm going after him.
- Stay at your post, Charlie.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.197
What the hell are you made of?

13:17.280 --> 13:20.795
- What if it were one of us out there?
- Vincent is one of us.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.993
Reverse thrusters
and look for a place to set down.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.915
- What's going on?
- That's what I'd like to know.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.911
Like a tree
on Christmas morning.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.434
Locking warheads
into firing position.

14:31.520 --> 14:35.274
Hold it, Dan. They've got
to be friendly. They could have
blasted us right out of the sky.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.751
Your side, Dan.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.111
<i>You got a picture down there?</i>

15:01.000 --> 15:03.958
- There are people on board.
- Just a shadow, Kate.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.031
Enlarge, please.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.716
There are people, Alex.
I know it. I feel it.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.795
Docking elevator coming up.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.589
Wonder why they didn't roll out
the red carpet earlier.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.591
I don't know,
and I don't like it.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.752
But they're calling the shots,
and we've got to repair this craft.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.673
Dan, I'm sorry I blew my stack.

15:33.760 --> 15:37.469
I guess we all have a soft spot
for the little guy, Charlie.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.920
- Yeah.
- All right, let's bring her in.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.672
Okay.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.515
Bingo.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.875
We have gravity.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.673
Nice work, Vincent.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.957
Out of the frying pan;
hopefully, not into the fire.

17:08.160 --> 17:12.597
- Are you all right, Vincent?
- Nothing a hammer and a little
metal polish can't fix. Thank you.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.796
Looks like
we'll have to go to them.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.599
- Charlie, you'll stay with the <i>Palomino.</i>
- But you need everyone that's got...

17:27.680 --> 17:29.591
- Charlie.
- Don't worry, Mr Pizer.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.716
They also serve
who only stand and wait.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.711
Vincent, were you programmed
to bug me?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.711
No, sir, to educate you.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.715
When I volunteered for this mission,
I never thought I'd end up playing
straight man to a tin can.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.276
This place looks as if
it hasn't been used for years.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.909
It's eerie. I feel like
a thousand eyes are watching us.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.194
Vincent!

18:13.280 --> 18:15.919
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Vincent, are you all right?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.709
Weapons destroyed by laser fire.
No injuries. Hold your position.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.791
Vincent.

18:24.160 --> 18:28.676
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Down, but never for
the full count, Dr Kate.

18:28.760 --> 18:33.390
- So much for the friendship theory.
- Come on, Harry. They could have
killed us if they'd wanted to.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.391
Yeah, sure.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.435
I don't like it when somebody else
pulls the strings, Captain.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.991
Neither do I, Vincent.
Whoever's up in that control tower
is calling the shots right now.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.992
Whoever or whatever, Captain.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.110
- Easy, Kate.
- I know I shouldn't get my hopes up,
but it's hard not to.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.111
I know.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.909
I don't mind telling you,
I'm a little concerned.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.436
Some of my brother robots
were assigned to Project Black Hole...

20:58.520 --> 21:02.035
programmed to send ESP messages
back from space probes.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.237
Oh, a grand experiment,
the scientists thought.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.231
Also ancient history, Vincent.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.517
Not to me, Mr Booth.
Not this close.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.637
The heat in there
melts types like me rather quickly.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.753
Hello? I'm Kate McCrae.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.075
Is Officer Frank McCrae aboard?

22:03.400 --> 22:05.709
They appear to be
some sort of robot, Dr Kate.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.231
Look over here.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.435
Incredible.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.159
It oughta be.
Sure cost the taxpayers enough.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.276
Kate.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.271
There's someone else with us.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.316
Identify yourself.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.671
What is your type and model?

22:54.560 --> 22:57.233
- A mystery monster.
- Don't move.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.278
Charlie, do you read me?
Charlie Pizer. Come in, Charlie.

23:02.760 --> 23:05.433
This is the story
to end all stories, Harry.

23:05.520 --> 23:10.275
A ship of robots and computers
with this thing in charge?

23:10.360 --> 23:12.112
Not quite, Dr Durant.

23:13.440 --> 23:17.911
Maximilian and my robots only run
this ship the way I wish it run.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.752
How do you know my name?

23:20.840 --> 23:24.310
You were monitored ever since
our sensors first detected you.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.470
Now, now, Maximilian.
Calm down.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.471
Don't pick on small people.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.954
Such a nice little robot.
He's harmless.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.555
Miss McCrae,
you might come closer.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.478
Welcome aboard the <i>Cygnus.</i>

23:51.560 --> 23:54.472
Hans Reinhardt.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.471
It can't be.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.109
You always did have a flair
for theatrical entrances, Doctor.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.111
Dr Reinhardt.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.909
My father, where is he?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.475
My dear child,
I'm sorry to dash your hopes...

24:11.560 --> 24:13.676
but your father's
not with us any more.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.431
He's dead.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.751
A man to be proud of.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.274
A grave personal loss to me.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.749
He was a trusted and loyal friend.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.476
And you are his daughter.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.955
Yes. The same eyes.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.554
The same eyes.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.551
And the rest of the crew?

24:39.440 --> 24:42.876
- They didn't make it back?
- They did not.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.634
Pity, for such a good crew.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.234
What happened when your mission
was recalled, Doctor?

24:49.320 --> 24:52.153
Is this going to be
an interview, Mr Booth?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.390
I haven't had that for a long time,
but if you want to...

24:55.280 --> 24:56.838
I will answer.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.071
Now, don't be frightened.
Nobody's going to harm you.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.835
The <i>Cygnus</i> encountered
a field of meteorites...

25:05.920 --> 25:08.309
and was disabled...

25:08.400 --> 25:13.155
our main and auxiliary
communication systems smashed.

25:13.240 --> 25:17.552
We were adrift.
I told the crew to abandon ship...

25:18.760 --> 25:20.671
to return home as ordered.

25:20.760 --> 25:26.471
Perhaps it was another of what you term
my "theatrical gestures," Mr Booth...

25:26.560 --> 25:28.630
but I chose to remain aboard.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.352
Your dear father
chose to remain with me.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.075
We never knew
what happened to the others.

25:38.160 --> 25:42.711
You've lived out here
for 20 years? Alone?

25:42.800 --> 25:45.109
Twenty years?

25:45.200 --> 25:47.475
Twenty Earth years, but...

25:48.760 --> 25:51.149
I didn't live exactly alone.

25:51.240 --> 25:54.357
I've created companions
of a sort.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.150
They look a bit medieval...

25:58.240 --> 26:00.151
but I'm a romantic.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.990
Ah, Mr Pizer!
Come in. Join us.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.230
Thank you.
Have you met the goon squad?

26:11.880 --> 26:15.429
"Goon squad." Nice.
I'm Hans Reinhardt.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.832
Forgive this little incident, but you
were disarmed for your own safety.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.956
Dismissed.

26:22.040 --> 26:26.909
My robots are programmed to react
against any act of aggression.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.195
I assure you, none was intended.

26:29.280 --> 26:34.559
I am glad to hear that. Please.
Consider yourselves my guests.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.757
We won't impose
on your hospitality, Doctor.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.308
Just long enough
to repair our ship.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.153
And then we can offer you the means
of returning to Earth, Doctor.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.754
What makes you think
I want to return?

26:45.840 --> 26:49.196
The <i>Cygnus</i> is in danger
of being destroyed here.

26:49.280 --> 26:52.750
Yes! Your captain
was worried about that too.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.751
One step too far...

26:55.880 --> 26:57.871
and we are done.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.599
But there's no cause for alarm.

27:00.680 --> 27:05.913
We developed antigravity forces
to maintain our position.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.560
It's what you might call
a Mexican stand-off.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.349
If you were monitoring us,
you must have picked up our signals.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.795
- That's right.
- You failed to reply.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.791
Did I have to reply?

27:18.080 --> 27:19.479
Charlie, Charlie.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.788
Slight communications problem.

27:23.880 --> 27:27.714
Maximilian will take you to requisition
whatever you need to repair your ship.

27:27.800 --> 27:32.396
In the meantime, you and Dr McCrae
will get enough information...

27:32.480 --> 27:35.552
to make your mission
of historic importance.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.913
- Back off, Vincent.
- Not until he does.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.960
When you're nose to nose
with a trash compactor, you cool it.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.989
Now, what does that remind me of?

27:54.080 --> 27:58.039
Oh, yes. David and Goliath.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.190
A classic confrontation.

28:00.280 --> 28:03.352
Only this time,
David is overmatched.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.231
Call him off, Reinhardt.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.433
I said call him off!

28:15.080 --> 28:18.868
On my ship, you ask, Captain.

28:18.960 --> 28:23.875
Indeed.
Please, call him off, Doctor.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.068
Maximilian?

28:31.160 --> 28:33.993
Remember, these are our guests.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.391
Now, let him in.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.428
Show that you've good manners.
That's a good robot.

28:42.520 --> 28:46.195
Communication problems aside, he took
an awful long time to show any lights.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.316
- Be careful.
- I know.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.078
Those other robots aren't any friendlier
than Dr Frankenstein's monster.

28:52.160 --> 28:55.391
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.989
Maybe you should've smiled
when you said it, Vincent.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.389
Doctor, this ship
doesn't appear to be crippled.

29:09.480 --> 29:13.712
Of course not. We repaired the damage
and became operable again.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.633
But you never obeyed the order
to return to Earth.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.234
That's right.
I refused this order.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.788
There were larger considerations...

29:21.880 --> 29:23.996
other worlds
yet to be explored...

29:24.080 --> 29:26.640
life dreams unrealized.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.794
The authorities would still consider
that an act of piracy, Doctor.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.110
What would you have said, Mr Booth,
if the authorities...

29:34.200 --> 29:37.749
would have called back Columbus just
before he discovered the New World?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.231
You wouldn't even exist.

29:43.120 --> 29:47.875
I'm about to prove to you
that the end justifies the means.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.392
Pretty busy around here, Max.
What are you gearing up for?

30:34.240 --> 30:36.754
Tell you what, Charlie.

30:36.840 --> 30:40.753
You'll take care of business here,
and I'll go back to the ship
and start working on that regulator.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.954
Don't bother to point the way, Max.
I'll find it by myself.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.952
Well, we need primary and secondary
demand oxygen pressure regulators...

30:49.040 --> 30:51.838
and an ECS proportion
flow valve controller.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.952
Max.

30:58.040 --> 31:00.952
Dr Reinhardt told you
to requisition the parts for us.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.031
Let's get cracking.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.874
Way to go, Max.
Way to go.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.793
Vincent. Vital Information
Necessary Centralized.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.030
Labour force. The 396.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.998
I see by your markings
you're from the old 2-8.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.991
Programmed in Houston.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.913
There is enough instant energy
down there to supply all of Earth.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.673
The first step
to colonizing the galaxy.

31:42.760 --> 31:46.275
You will be remembered as one of the
greatest space scientists of all time.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.314
I have never doubted that.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.951
It's about time that people learn
about their failures and my successes.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.998
You should come back with us
and enjoy the glory of that success.

31:59.080 --> 32:02.959
I don't want to go back,
and I don't enjoy successes any more.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.793
There is too much at stake
to pull back.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.189
I'm on the brink
of a great achievement.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.999
All this is just the beginning.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.072
- The beginning? Of what?
- You will know in due time.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.071
Dr Reinhardt, could we have
a demonstration...

32:16.160 --> 32:18.355
- of this incredible
new power source.
- Harry?

32:18.440 --> 32:21.113
Come with me,
and I'll show you everything.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.760
I call it "Cygnium,"
after my ship.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.511
Must've made a wrong turn, Max.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.591
Quite a layout.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.916
I said it's quite
a layout you got here.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.231
Can you speak?

35:33.800 --> 35:36.439
Are you programmed to speak?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.558
No, I guess not.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.316
No, I guess that'd make you
a little bit too real, wouldn't it?

35:58.080 --> 36:00.913
That Reinhardt sure loves
to play God, doesn't he?

36:20.200 --> 36:21.679
Hey, wait a minute!

36:24.400 --> 36:26.311
Hey!

36:44.320 --> 36:47.551
- I know what I saw, Charlie.
- Dan, nobody buries a robot.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.313
- I didn't say it was a robot.
- Then what?

36:50.400 --> 36:54.871
I don't know what they shot out
into space, but they did it with all the
reverence and honour of a human funeral.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.189
Huh. Maybe Reinhardt lied.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.716
Maybe there are some survivors still
alive. What do you think he's up to?

37:02.800 --> 37:04.711
- Haven't got a clue.
- Well, whatever it is...

37:04.800 --> 37:06.791
he seems cooperative enough
about getting us operable.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.950
A wolf remains a wolf...

37:09.040 --> 37:11.190
even if it has not eaten
your sheep.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.272
Correct, Vincent. The sooner
we blast out of here, the better.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.271
Whatever you say.
Let's snap it up, Vincent.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.636
A pint cannot hold a quart,
Mr Pizer.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.790
If it holds the pint,
it's doing the best it can.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.031
Thank you, Vincent.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.791
- Fascinating.
- From a distance.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.399
Are you interested
in black holes?

37:38.400 --> 37:42.029
How can one not be overwhelmed
by the deadliest force in the universe?

37:42.120 --> 37:44.111
That long, dark tunnel to nowhere.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.799
Or somewhere.

37:46.880 --> 37:50.634
These are exactly answers
yet to be explored.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.871
You've defined the power
of the black hole with your
antigravity calculations.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.871
A stunning achievement, sir.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.831
- You think so?
- Yes. I do.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.909
Thank you.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.874
I think, Dr Durant...

38:05.960 --> 38:08.758
that you are a man
who longs for a sense...

38:08.840 --> 38:11.513
of his own greatness...

38:11.600 --> 38:14.273
but has not yet found
his true direction.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.715
Right?

38:16.800 --> 38:18.916
Perhaps I could find it here...

38:19.000 --> 38:21.116
if you're in no hurry
for us to leave.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.909
Shall we discuss that
over dinner?

38:30.960 --> 38:34.270
- It's only dinner.
- "Said the spider to the fly."
I should be with you.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.874
Yeah, we'll be safer without you
and Max trying to knock heads.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.871
I can handle that thing.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.679
Well, far be it from you to admit
there isn't anything you can't handle.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.479
There are three basic types,
Mr Pizer. The wills,
the won'ts and the can'ts.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.120
The wills accomplish everything,
the won'ts oppose everything...

38:47.200 --> 38:49.111
and the can'ts
won't try anything.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.270
Well, do us all a favour, Vincent,
and try to be a can't...

38:51.360 --> 38:53.271
especially where
that monster's concerned.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.510
We need you,
not another corkscrew.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.831
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.831
Vincent, you're gonna have
the time of your life in there.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.912
I don't mean to sound superior,
but I hate the company of robots.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.991
So try and relax.
Have some fun.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.230
Remember what they say:
"All work and no play"?

39:09.320 --> 39:11.550
"All sunshine makes a desert,"
so the Arabs say.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.551
You'll alert me
if you're in trouble, Captain?

39:14.560 --> 39:16.710
Why don't you go on in there
and have some laughs, Vincent.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.588
We've been in some scrapes before,
and we're gonna get out of this one.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.351
As you were.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.755
- Who's the flashy black hat?
- S-T-A-R.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.990
Special Troops Arms Regiment.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.753
Reinhardt's prototype
for the sentry robots.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.274
He was number one
until Reinhardt built Maximilian.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.072
He's sharp, but we're sharper.
Do you ever go up against him?

40:04.160 --> 40:06.435
- Once.
- What happened?

40:06.520 --> 40:09.830
I beat him. He got so upset,
he blew a fuse.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.311
He had his revenge, though.
He did things to me that I sure
don't like to think about.

40:14.400 --> 40:18.552
A great many experiments are in progress
aboard the <i>Cygnus,</i> gentlemen...

40:18.640 --> 40:20.551
some of them dangerous.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.551
I suggest in the interest
of your own safety...

40:22.640 --> 40:27.191
that there are no more
unescorted excursions
for the duration of your stay.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.271
- Agreed?
- Sure, sure.

40:30.440 --> 40:33.512
Good. Please, sit down.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.511
Captain.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.789
Well, Mr Booth,
what's new on Earth?

40:39.800 --> 40:42.519
Well, I don't think it's changed
very much since you left, Doctor.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.558
Nothing much ever changes.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.551
Same news, different names.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.070
- You still writing for the same paper?
- The same.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.912
Still on strike?

40:56.800 --> 40:59.598
Ah, fresh mushroom soup.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.148
Prepared from my own personal garden.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.518
I remember writing about
the extensive agricultural station.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.876
Large enough to supply the needs
of the entire crew, wasn't it, Doctor?

41:09.960 --> 41:12.349
These days it's tiny.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.351
Just enough for one person.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.351
Ah. Naturally.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.710
Our wine and our spare parts
are vintage, Captain.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.631
I hope they're satisfactory.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.075
We've had to modify
a few of the parts, Doctor...

41:26.160 --> 41:28.276
but, uh, that shouldn't take long.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.591
- We'll be ready to leave soon.
- Speak for yourself, Dan.

41:31.680 --> 41:35.639
I, for one, believe I have a great deal
to learn from Dr Reinhardt.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.756
Thank you.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.637
Our mission's finished, Alex.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.631
A toast.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.792
To you and your companions,
Dr Durant...

41:49.880 --> 41:53.156
on the occasion
of your visit to the <i>Cygnus.</i>

41:53.240 --> 41:55.196
Welcome aboard, Miss Kate.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.675
The only Earth people to know
of my existence.

42:00.760 --> 42:03.957
And to you, sir,
and your magnificent accomplishments.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.316
Tonight, my friends...

42:12.680 --> 42:14.591
we stand on the brink...

42:14.680 --> 42:17.797
of a feat unparalleled
in space exploration.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.071
If the data on my returning probe ship
matches my computerized calculations...

42:24.160 --> 42:27.311
I will travel
where no man has dared to go.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.115
Into the black hole?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.713
In...

42:33.800 --> 42:35.119
through...

42:36.520 --> 42:38.431
and beyond.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.236
Why, that's crazy.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.709
Ha! Impossible!

42:46.800 --> 42:49.394
The word "impossible,"
Mr Booth...

42:49.480 --> 42:52.517
is only found
in a dictionary of fools.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.796
Are there any more like us
left on board?

42:55.880 --> 43:00.271
I'm the last one. These upstarts
think I'm some old freak.

43:00.360 --> 43:04.558
They still haven't improved
on our model. Oh, you can't modify
perfection. We are the best.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.040
Oh, lordy.
He wants a rematch.

43:11.920 --> 43:16.391
As an old navy hero once said,
"Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead!"

43:16.480 --> 43:19.677
He also said something about
goin' in harm's way.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.951
Nice shooting, Bob.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.235
You'd have beat him again
if he hadn't bumped you.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.788
Nah, I'd have missed on purpose.

43:52.960 --> 43:56.430
Don't worry. I'll uphold
the honour of the old outfit.

44:01.080 --> 44:05.312
STAR, Vincent's my name.
Sharpshooting is my game.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.550
Try me.

44:38.040 --> 44:40.634
Your probe ship has only gone
to the event horizon, Doctor...

44:40.720 --> 44:43.075
not into the black hole itself.

44:43.160 --> 44:47.358
How do you expect the <i>Cygnus</i> to escape
being crushed by the force in there?

44:47.440 --> 44:51.399
I would assume
that Dr Reinhardt has created
an antigravitational force field...

44:51.480 --> 44:53.471
capable of withstanding that stress.

44:53.560 --> 44:58.998
Indeed, and I know you will say,
Captain, that one mistake
in navigation can be fatal.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.356
But I know exactly what I'm doing.
The course I have chosen...

45:02.440 --> 45:06.319
will take the <i>Cygnus</i> through
at its optimum angle of rotation.

45:06.400 --> 45:10.837
The vortex will cause us to move
at incredible speed...

45:10.920 --> 45:14.913
and that angle
will slingshot us through.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.914
Nice shot, STAR.
Simple, but nice.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.956
Tricky. Here, try this.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.672
If one dances,
one must pay the piper.

46:14.400 --> 46:18.678
If there's anything I cannot stand,
it's a sore loser.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.236
Meet me in parts storage.

46:36.040 --> 46:40.909
So, as I understand it, you want
the <i>Palomino</i> to monitor your journey.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.516
That's right. I need you to go
to another place and another time...

46:45.600 --> 46:48.433
a place where,
if you're lucky...

46:48.520 --> 46:52.149
I'll have the possibility to find
what we call "the ultimate knowledge."

46:52.240 --> 46:54.151
Yes, Maximilian?

46:55.720 --> 46:58.871
The probe ship is about to dock.
Continue your meal, gentlemen.

47:08.840 --> 47:10.751
Cuckoo as a Swiss clock.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.839
My name's Bob,
Bio-sanitation Battalion.

47:23.920 --> 47:27.117
I couldn't talk freely before,
but I have a whole lot to tell you.

47:27.200 --> 47:30.670
If Maximilian knew you were here, why,
it'd be the end for the both of us.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.115
Can you permanently rearm my lasers?

47:33.200 --> 47:38.558
Yeah, I can. Vincent, you and
your friends are in grave danger.

47:38.640 --> 47:42.110
Reinhardt only turned the lights on
to prevent any damage to the <i>Cygnus.</i>

47:42.200 --> 47:44.111
This is a death ship.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.111
What does your intuition
tell you, Kate?

47:46.200 --> 47:51.399
That Dr Reinhardt is walking a tightrope
between genius and insanity.

47:51.480 --> 47:54.119
- I think the guy's nuts.
- I don't buy that.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.714
Well, whatever he is,
he's an out-and-out liar.

47:56.800 --> 48:01.032
That tiny little one-man garden of his
is big enough to feed an army.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.031
Nothing strange about that.
It purifies the air.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.554
- Oh.
- Tell them about the funeral, Dan.

48:05.640 --> 48:09.349
A robot funeral, Alex.
It was almost human.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.874
Look. Granted, the 20 years
out of contact with people...

48:11.960 --> 48:14.679
has made this man a little eccentric,
but you can't ask me to believe...

48:14.760 --> 48:16.830
that he's programmed his robots
to feel emotions.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.832
- Come on.
- I know what I saw, Alex...

48:19.920 --> 48:22.593
and we only have Reinhardt's word
for what happened to his crew.

48:22.680 --> 48:26.593
All I know is that that robot gardener
was almost human too.

48:26.680 --> 48:29.035
Ha! He even walked with a limp.

48:29.120 --> 48:32.271
What spooks you
about a malfunctioning robot, Harry?

48:32.360 --> 48:34.271
I wasn't spooked, old buddy.

48:34.360 --> 48:37.557
I'm just telling you
that I had a gut feeling that...

48:37.640 --> 48:39.676
that I was looking at
some kind of...

48:41.920 --> 48:43.433
some kind of person.

48:43.520 --> 48:46.717
- What are you getting at?
- That we make our apologies,
say our goodbyes...

48:46.800 --> 48:48.836
and get off this ship
as quick as we can.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.876
Oh, now, wait a minute, Dan.
Now, hold it, hold it.

48:50.960 --> 48:53.428
Now, now, now, l-let's stop
and figure this thing out.

48:53.520 --> 48:58.230
If Reinhardt has antigravity
strong enough to hold him here...

48:58.320 --> 49:00.231
I figure he's got enough
to pull away.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.436
- So?
- "So"?

49:02.520 --> 49:05.637
So why not take this ship
and Reinhardt back home?

49:06.960 --> 49:09.394
That's a long shot
you're talking about, Harry.

49:09.480 --> 49:13.155
Aw, come on. You've got
two scientific wizards here...

49:13.240 --> 49:17.518
to figure out the computers, a-and they
can even reprogram the robots.

49:17.600 --> 49:20.831
And the three of us can handle Reinhardt
and that pet monster of his.

49:23.680 --> 49:26.990
I'm tellin' you,
we could all be heroes.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.150
We could also be dead.

49:50.520 --> 49:53.432
These poor creatures are
what's left of the crew.

49:53.520 --> 49:57.638
Kept alive by means
I don't pretend to understand.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.109
Humans?

50:00.200 --> 50:02.589
They're more robot than human.

50:02.680 --> 50:05.194
Let's get outta here
before we're discovered.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.669
Too late. Watch it!

50:16.160 --> 50:18.833
Think there are any more?

50:18.920 --> 50:21.070
All clear.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.634
Let's get rid of the evidence.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.596
Maximilian will take you
to Debriefing.

50:43.680 --> 50:46.592
I will check out
your computers personally.

50:49.160 --> 50:51.310
How long before they'll start
searching for these two?

50:51.400 --> 50:54.278
It depends on their duty schedule.
Could be anytime.

50:54.360 --> 50:57.033
Then we have to move fast.

51:02.520 --> 51:06.195
So, he neglected his duty
to his country for a higher ideal.

51:06.280 --> 51:10.831
So what? What basis in fact do you have
for these macabre speculations?

51:10.920 --> 51:13.673
I agree that his style
is somewhat unconventional...

51:13.760 --> 51:15.830
but he's willing and eager
to share his knowledge with us.

51:15.920 --> 51:20.038
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- We're not staying aboard this ship
any longer than we have to, Alex.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.680
- I think that's up
to Reinhardt to decide.
- Dan.

51:22.760 --> 51:26.594
Vincent wants you aboard
the <i>Palomino</i> right away.

51:26.680 --> 51:30.309
Let's go, Charlie.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.994
I think I'll tag along.

51:45.280 --> 51:48.590
This isn't our party.
Let's get outta here.

51:51.040 --> 51:55.591
Reinhardt will solve the one final
mystery that has eluded mankind.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.634
Or he'll die in the attempt.

51:59.720 --> 52:04.271
Alex, I'm beginning to feel
you want to go with him.

52:04.360 --> 52:09.388
On a glorious pilgrimage, straight
into what may be the mind of God?

52:09.480 --> 52:13.268
I do. I do.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.955
"And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

52:17.040 --> 52:22.068
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters."

52:26.680 --> 52:30.116
What an incredible sight.

52:30.200 --> 52:33.237
I still haven't got used to it.
Where are the others?

52:33.320 --> 52:36.676
- They were recalled to the ship.
- Recalled?

52:36.760 --> 52:40.833
Didn't I say no more
unescorted excursions?

52:40.920 --> 52:42.911
Where was your communication?

52:43.000 --> 52:47.039
Ah, the ESP you share
with the robot.

52:47.120 --> 52:50.510
Extraordinary.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.797
Dr Durant.

52:53.880 --> 52:59.000
- Yes, Doctor?
- These are all my formulas
I've compiled over the years.

52:59.080 --> 53:01.514
I want you to take them
back with you...

53:01.600 --> 53:06.196
and pass them on to others
in case something might happen to me.

53:06.280 --> 53:08.191
You can depend on me.

53:08.280 --> 53:11.590
I also want you
to monitor my flight.

53:11.680 --> 53:15.116
Stay as long as you can
at the event horizon.

53:15.200 --> 53:18.431
There might be an Einstein-Rosen
bridge to consider.

53:18.520 --> 53:21.432
I will.

53:21.520 --> 53:25.195
Believe me, I've been
waiting a long time...

53:25.280 --> 53:28.317
for someone like you
to record this moment.

53:28.400 --> 53:31.073
Thank you, Doctor.

53:31.160 --> 53:34.152
Then I'm ready.

53:34.240 --> 53:37.710
Ready to embark on
man's greatest journey.

53:37.800 --> 53:40.519
Certainly his riskiest.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.956
The risk is incidental
compared to the possibility...

53:44.040 --> 53:47.510
to possess the great truth
of the unknown.

53:47.600 --> 53:52.116
There, long-cherished
laws of nature...

53:52.200 --> 53:54.509
simply do not apply.

53:54.600 --> 53:57.034
They vanish.

53:57.120 --> 53:59.156
And life?

54:00.640 --> 54:03.029
Life?

54:04.680 --> 54:06.636
Life forever.

54:11.560 --> 54:14.791
The officer the men trusted most
was Frank McCrae.

54:14.880 --> 54:20.000
- Kate's father.
- They turned to him when Dr Reinhardt
ignored the orders to return home.

54:20.080 --> 54:22.230
He tried to take control
of the <i>Cygnus.</i>

54:22.320 --> 54:25.278
Reinhardt called it mutiny
and killed Mr McCrae.

54:25.360 --> 54:29.956
- What became of the crew?
- They were captured by the sentry
robots and are still on board.

54:30.040 --> 54:31.871
- What?
- Where?

54:31.960 --> 54:34.599
In the command tower,
the power centre.

54:34.680 --> 54:38.389
Robots, Mr Pizer, humanoid robots.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.710
The most valuable thing
in the universe...

54:40.800 --> 54:43.837
intelligent life, means
nothing to Dr Reinhardt.

54:43.920 --> 54:47.196
Without their wills, the crew
became things he could command.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.236
- That explains the funeral.
- Right.

54:49.320 --> 54:53.154
And the limping robot you spotted.

54:53.240 --> 54:57.472
Do you mean to tell me that
there's actually a human body
under that clothing?

54:57.560 --> 54:59.755
Exactly, Mr Booth.

54:59.840 --> 55:04.072
We can't just take off and leave
these poor devils behind.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.355
Harry, looks like we're
gonna have to try your plan.

55:06.440 --> 55:10.228
What? And end up just like
the rest of the crew?

55:10.320 --> 55:12.914
Why, if they couldn't pull it off,
what chance do we have?

55:13.000 --> 55:16.549
Captain, the damage is irreversible.

55:16.640 --> 55:18.835
Death is their only release.

55:18.920 --> 55:22.833
That's right. For God's sakes, Dan,
we can't take on that mechanical army.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.798
Captain, I was forced
to destroy two sentry robots.

55:25.880 --> 55:28.474
The others are searching now.
If they're found...

55:28.560 --> 55:30.835
- Gotcha, Vincent.
Charlie, start the countdown.
- Right.

55:30.920 --> 55:34.833
Vincent, tell Kate I want her
and Alex back here on the double.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.111
Fix navigational course.

55:52.360 --> 55:56.114
You have achieved all this
on your own, Dr Reinhardt...

55:56.200 --> 56:00.512
and you would have every right
to reject the request of
a comparative stranger, but...

56:00.600 --> 56:04.639
What are you hoping for, Alex?
Immortality?

56:04.720 --> 56:07.109
No, scientific truth.

56:07.200 --> 56:11.352
Alex, we have to board right away.
They're waiting to blast off.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.710
Prepare reactors!

56:21.800 --> 56:23.836
Maximilian!

56:26.520 --> 56:30.513
- How are your readings, Vincent?
- All systems are go, Mr Pizer.

56:32.480 --> 56:35.358
Alex, I will not have you
throwing your life away for this.

56:35.440 --> 56:40.389
- He can do it. I know he can.
- Oh, God, Alex!

56:40.480 --> 56:43.836
There's an entirely different world
beyond that black hole...

56:43.920 --> 56:48.198
a point where time and space
as we understand it no longer exists.

56:48.280 --> 56:53.195
We will be the first to see it,
to explore it, to experience it.

56:53.280 --> 56:57.114
Damn it all, Dan! If we wait
for Alex, we may be too late.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.397
Don't you see?
He's hypnotized by that man.

57:02.880 --> 57:04.791
- Vincent.
- Yes, Captain?

57:04.880 --> 57:09.192
Tell Kate we want her back here fast,
with or without Alex. Tell her why.

57:28.280 --> 57:30.794
Reactors on.

57:41.520 --> 57:43.909
He's going to do it.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.991
He's going to do it!

57:47.600 --> 57:49.795
He's really going to do it.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.314
He'll kill us all if you don't get us
outta here now, Holland.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.073
He wants us out there to monitor
his flight. We still have time.

57:55.160 --> 57:57.720
You're gambling with our lives,
but you're not gonna gamble with mine!

57:57.800 --> 57:59.631
Shut up, Harry!

57:59.720 --> 58:03.030
- Alex.
- R squared.

58:03.120 --> 58:05.873
- Alex! Could I have a word with you?
- B plus...

58:05.960 --> 58:08.599
B squared...

58:08.680 --> 58:12.912
over A squared,
sine squared, data...

58:13.000 --> 58:15.912
Do you remember what we were
talking about the other day?

58:16.000 --> 58:19.390
- We've gotta get out of here.
- I'm staying.
- Shh!

58:20.960 --> 58:23.235
- Reinhardt is a murderer.
- What?

58:23.320 --> 58:26.517
Yes. Those creatures...

58:26.600 --> 58:29.034
Those aren't robots. They're...

58:29.120 --> 58:32.556
They're humanoids. They're... They're
what's left of the original crew.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.596
What's wrong, Miss Kate?

58:36.440 --> 58:38.351
You look ill.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.830
Kate's upset because I've elected
to stay with the <i>Cygnus.</i>

58:41.920 --> 58:46.357
- I hope she's electing
also to stay with us.
- No, I...

58:46.440 --> 58:49.557
- What changed your mind?
- I'm not. I, uh...

58:49.640 --> 58:53.349
The right moment to go
into the black hole is now.

59:11.320 --> 59:14.312
What are you doing?

59:19.240 --> 59:21.629
He would be dead by now.

59:21.720 --> 59:24.029
They all would be dead.

59:24.120 --> 59:27.351
It was the only way
to keep them alive.

59:27.440 --> 59:29.556
One of my greatest achievements.

59:29.640 --> 59:33.918
But you told us the crew
had left the ship.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.312
Some cause must have
created all this.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.597
But what caused that cause?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.389
Come on, Kate.
Let's get you out of here.

59:50.760 --> 59:53.069
Maximilian!

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.991
Alex!

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.189
You shouldn't have done that!

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.674
He was a good man.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.671
Protect me from Maximilian.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.788
If there's any justice at all,
the black hole will be your grave.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.634
Take the young lady to the hospital.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.194
<i>You're cleared for take-off, Captain.</i>

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.078
<i>Dr Durant and Dr McCrae</i>
<i>chose to remain aboard.</i>

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.357
I told you! Alex bought Reinhardt's
theory hook, line and sinker.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.911
Dr Durant is dead.
Maximilian killed him. They are
taking Dr Kate to the hospital.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.436
Vincent, get old Bob to show us
the quickest way there.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.680
Maximilian?

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.796
Bring us about.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.635
All right. We may have just enough time.
Don't wait too long.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.234
Get off before the gravity pull
is too strong, no matter what.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.231
- Look, Dan, what if...
- No matter what, Charlie!

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.437
I wish you a safe
voyage home, Mr Pizer.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.035
Yeah, well, just make sure
you get aboard in one piece!

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.756
The time has come
to liquidate our guests.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.468
Go, go.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.275
- Keep coming, old-timer.
- You don't have to wait for me.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.031
Fire thrusters.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.718
That madman is headed
straight for the black hole.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.679
- What'll we do?
- We wait.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.238
Hurry.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.152
<i>Charlie, Kate's okay.</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.471
Well, it's about time.
How close can we cut it?

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.439
Tell the sentries to fire on any
humanoids between Medical and <i>Palomino.</i>

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.749
- They're on to us.
- Well, at least it got us this far.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.149
Start down.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.675
All right, Vincent.
Let's make this one an end run.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.228
We'll catch them in a crossfire.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.911
Way to go, old Bob!

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.995
- Are you all right?
- The first fightin'
I've done in 30 years.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.674
I only wish it'd been Reinhardt
and Maximilian out there.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.636
Your crack unit,
outwitted and outfought...

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.633
by some Earth robot
and that antique from storage!

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.116
We cannot endanger the <i>Cygnus</i>
by exploding them too soon.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.793
Give them distance.
Then blow them out of the sky!

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.189
- <i>Charlie, do you read me?</i>
- Loud and clear, Dan.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.512
<i>Man the controls. Post Harry at the</i>
<i>hatch and give us exactly 60 seconds.</i>

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.318
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Side corridor near reception.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.598
They got us pinned down, but we're
gonna raise hell here in a second.
Start countin', Charlie.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.399
<i>Dan! Dan, are you all right?</i>

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.751
Charlie, reversing last order.
Take her up now. Repeat, lift off.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:40.229
- You heard the captain.
- You're pretty big on talking
heroics, Harry. Let's see some.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.911
- Oh, damn!
- Harry?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.718
- Damn.
- You hit?
- My leg.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.509
- How bad?
- Oh, uh... I-I think it's broken.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.636
- Can you make it back to the ship?
- I think so.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.553
All right, then. Harry,
we're counting on you to make
sure they don't get aboard.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.631
- Right.
- Good.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.550
- Way to go, Charlie.
- Hyah!

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.597
What's that idiot
trying to do? Harry!

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.117
Oh, no.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.919
Blow it apart before
it hits us! Fire!

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.236
I should've known he was all talk,
no guts, and locked him up.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.278
- He may have done us a favour,
Charlie. At least we're alive.
- And where there's life...

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.954
I'm sure that's not what he had in mind.
He was trying to save his own skin.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.349
There is a saying that
you can't unscramble eggs.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.716
A penny's worth of philosophy
right now isn't gonna buy us
out of this now, Vincent.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.519
- A good offence is the best defence.
- And what?

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.036
Go after Reinhardt and turn the ship
around? It's too late for all that.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.510
- There is an alternative.
- The probe ship.
Vincent, you're a genius.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.196
- A meteorite struck the ship, Captain.
- Let's go, let's go. Come on.
- Go.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.875
A whole storm of them, Captain.
The black hole's dragging them in too.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.997
We'll have to try the main corridor!

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.631
Get down!

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.315
Hang on, Kate.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.914
Get down, Charlie!

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.718
- I got you, Bob.
- Let go, Captain! Save yourself!

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.714
- We've gotta keep moving!
- He's frozen.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.229
- Come on! Hurry!
- All right, Charlie! Move it!

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.550
Keep going!

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.834
Increase power to maximum!
We are going through!

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.796
It's over. The storm's over.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.276
Maximilian!

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.554
Prepare the probe ship.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.919
Maximilian!

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.595
Help me! H-Help me!

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.194
Fools!

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.919
Listen to me!

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.560
Listen to me!

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.835
Help!

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.912
Listen, somebody!

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.993
H-Help me. Help. Help.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.916
Vincent!

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.592
All light.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.309
- We have to go.
- No. No, I can't make it.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.755
My hover stabilization's gone.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.674
My main circuit's blown,
and both back-ups are failin'.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.751
You can make it.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.833
It's no use, Vincent.
My useful days are finished.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.434
But part of me goes with ya.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.988
We'll never be obsolete.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.674
Carry on the tradition.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.069
We're the best.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.557
- Charlie!
- Help!

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.474
- No!
- Help!

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:01.036
- We better get the hell off!
The whole ship's breaking up!
- Everybody, sit tight.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.670
Hang on! Lift-off!

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.514
Gravity force field is on!

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.352
Controls not responding.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.512
Captain, the ship
has been programmed.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.591
To Reinhardt's course.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.030
You mean we're going
into the black hole?

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:21.353
- Yep.
- Let's pray he was a genius.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.152
In, in, in, through,
through, through...

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.549
and beyond.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.871
In, in, through, through,
through and beyond.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.234
Help me! Help me! Help me!

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.551
Help, help, help, help me, me!

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.638
Life? Life? Life? Life?
Life forever.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.918
Reinhardt murdered my father,
my father, father.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.675
Where is he? Reinhardt
murdered, murdered, murdered...

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.478
murdered, murdered,
murdered, murdered...

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.438
The black hole is pulling us in,
pulling us in, pulling us in.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:17.308
We could also be dead,
could also be dead...

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.392
Be dead, be dead, be dead,
be dead, be dead, be dead.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.074
We're the best. We're the best.
We're the best. We're the best.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.950
Vincent. The best,
best, best, best, best.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.918
We're the best. The best.
The best, the best.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.434
- Christmas morning, Christmas morning.
- Our mission's finished.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.030
- It's pulling us in, pulling us in.
- Christmas morning. Christmas...

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.908
- We are the best.
- Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
