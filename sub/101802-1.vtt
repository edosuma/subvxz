love this backyard.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.844
You got brushes and paints,
the whole schmear.

26:12.924 --> 26:16.248
Did you just say
"the whole schmear?"

26:16.328 --> 26:20.492
Yeah, my best friend’s grandpa
says it all the time.

26:20.572 --> 26:22.013
Did I use it wrong?

26:22.094 --> 26:25.457
No, no, you definitely
used it correctly.

26:25.537 --> 26:28.620
I just didn’t expect it
coming from a 10-year-old.

26:28.700 --> 26:33.145
Well, I just turned 11,
and I’m an old soul.

26:33.225 --> 26:37.469
Right. You know, I definitely
should’ve picked up on that.

26:39.551 --> 26:41.553

26:42.194 --> 26:46.118
You must be jet-lagged.
Is that really a thing?

26:46.198 --> 26:47.599
Sometimes.

26:47.679 --> 26:49.401
Well, a nice dinner
and a good night’s rest

26:49.481 --> 26:50.682
should catch you up.

26:50.762 --> 26:53.925
You’re right.
Let’s see here.

26:54.005 --> 26:58.650
Ooh. The Kringles
Christmas Steak House on 4th.

26:58.730 --> 27:00.852
It doesn’t look like
it’s too far from here.

27:00.932 --> 27:02.374
Great choice.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.376
These were a nice touch,
by the way.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.538
What can I say?
We promise an experience.

27:06.618 --> 27:08.780
And I loved
every minute so far.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.782
Thanks for the cookies too.

27:10.862 --> 27:13.985
Yeah. Deb wanted me to tell you
they’re from my dad.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.828
Okay. I’ll be sure
to thank him.

27:16.908 --> 27:18.990
Okay, well, if you need
anything else,

27:19.070 --> 27:20.392
I’ll just be right next door
at Deb’s.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.394
Oh, who’s Deb?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.556
She’s our neighbor.
She kinda keeps an eye on me

27:24.636 --> 27:26.678
until my dad gets home
from work.

27:26.758 --> 27:28.320
Oh, okay.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.002
Well, if you need
anything else, I’ll just--

27:31.082 --> 27:33.685
Oh, no, no, no.
I am low maintenance. Go ahead.

27:33.765 --> 27:37.329
Good to know.
Have a nice dinner.

27:37.409 --> 27:39.411
Bye.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.458
[sighs]

27:51.503 --> 27:54.706
You have to understand
what you did was not acceptable.

27:54.786 --> 27:56.868
I mean, what if she was
some kind of--

27:56.948 --> 27:58.270
What?

27:58.350 --> 27:59.951
I don’t know.
A crazy person.

28:00.031 --> 28:03.195
She doesn’t seem crazy at all.
She seems very nice.

28:03.275 --> 28:05.076
Mia, that’s not the point.

28:05.156 --> 28:06.798
You seem a little crazy.

28:06.878 --> 28:08.840
You rented out my guesthouse.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.202
This is our house.

28:10.282 --> 28:11.323
You’re not paying
the mortgage.

28:11.403 --> 28:12.924
Well, thanks to me,

28:13.004 --> 28:14.686
now you have a little extra
change in your pockets

28:14.766 --> 28:16.768
for the next few weeks.

28:17.609 --> 28:19.291
Mia, we got very lucky,

28:19.371 --> 28:20.692
and you also did a wonderful job
cleaning up the guesthouse.

28:20.772 --> 28:22.214
Thank you.

28:22.294 --> 28:24.015
But doing something like this
behind my back

28:24.095 --> 28:25.977
is unacceptable.

28:26.057 --> 28:28.340
And what on earth
made you do such a thing?

28:28.420 --> 28:31.663
Well, you said getting a dog
was a big responsibility

28:31.743 --> 28:33.345
and there were costs,

28:33.425 --> 28:35.227
so I figured
if I could show you

28:35.307 --> 28:37.429
that I was responsible
and industrious

28:37.509 --> 28:38.990
by taking care of our guests,

28:39.070 --> 28:40.472
bringing in
a little extra money,

28:40.552 --> 28:42.314
you might come around.

28:42.394 --> 28:44.996
You have a one-track mind,
you know that?

28:47.319 --> 28:49.921
I know where you get that from.

28:52.324 --> 28:54.246
- Sorry, Dad.
- It’s okay, sweetheart.

28:54.326 --> 28:56.007
I just don’t want you
to be dishonest.

28:56.087 --> 28:58.530
Misleading people
is the same as a lie.

28:58.610 --> 29:01.453
She seems very nice though,
doesn’t she?

29:01.533 --> 29:04.456
Yeah, she seems that way,
but just...

29:04.536 --> 29:07.299
But I’m gonna have to wait
on my dog, aren’t I?

29:07.379 --> 29:09.501
Hang this over there,
would you?

Oh, my God.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.842

29:30.922 --> 29:33.044
I’m a little freaked out
because I have to give a speech.

29:33.124 --> 29:35.407
- You have to?
- I volunteered.

29:35.487 --> 29:38.129
Now I’m getting second thoughts,
and I’m really nervous.

29:38.209 --> 29:39.611
Well, sometimes nervous

29:39.691 --> 29:42.534
is just excitement
you don’t recognize.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.616
What is that?

29:46.418 --> 29:48.099
What’s your speech
supposed to be about?

29:48.179 --> 29:49.661
What’s Christmas all about.

29:49.741 --> 29:52.504
And a visual presentation
has to go with it.

29:52.584 --> 29:56.828
But I’d like it
to be artistic.

29:56.908 --> 29:58.310
Artistic, you say?

29:58.390 --> 30:02.033
You kinda draw like
a three-year-old, Dad.

30:02.113 --> 30:03.355
Yeah, I kinda do.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.397
Yeah. What is that?

30:05.477 --> 30:07.719
That’s Santa’s sleigh
with presents.

30:07.799 --> 30:10.322
- Here, you draw something.
- What is that?

30:10.402 --> 30:11.883
That one’s a reindeer,

30:11.963 --> 30:14.366
and that one’s
a gingerbread man.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.689

Yeah, astronomy is a hobby
of mine, I guess.

31:35.206 --> 31:37.208
Really?

31:43.535 --> 31:45.336
What’s that?

31:45.417 --> 31:47.939
Mia always wants
to decorate back here.

31:48.019 --> 31:49.340
I’ve been so busy at work.

31:49.421 --> 31:51.142
I’m lucky to get a tree up
this year.

31:51.222 --> 31:53.785
She wanted to like hang up
some lights and do something.

31:53.865 --> 31:55.346
It’s not really my strong suit.

31:55.427 --> 31:57.789
I hope I haven’t been
too much of a trouble.

31:57.869 --> 31:59.871
No, I didn’t mean it
like that.

32:05.196 --> 32:06.438
What’s wrong?

32:06.518 --> 32:08.119
I forgot my pencil.

32:08.199 --> 32:10.361
Oh, well, I have one
in the guesthouse.

for some Christmas lights.

39:39.530 --> 39:42.173

to track a few down.

39:42.253 --> 39:44.335

Mia pesters him every year

She is the sweetest.

You know, those two are

Gosh, my family and I
moved here from Chicago

40:16.647 --> 40:19.010

40:19.090 --> 40:21.172
It’s a great place

About six years ago.

44:38.909 --> 44:41.952
Mia mentioned about her mom
always decorating.

I mean,
I didn’t wanna pry, but--

44:43.754 --> 44:47.037

it was a big part of the reason

Dreamed about it
ever since I was little.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.990
Even bounced around a few times
before landing there.

45:20.070 --> 45:22.112
But I don’t know.

45:22.192 --> 45:24.034
Now that I’ve been there
and worked there,

45:24.114 --> 45:27.918
it just kind of
lost its luster,

45:27.998 --> 45:29.880

45:29.960 --> 45:32.082

I used to live in New York
once upon a time.

45:34.725 --> 45:38.369

I had my restaurant there.

for a short time.

Well, I was madly in love
for six years.

one of those things.

46:26.256 --> 46:30.100

who we are anymore.

46:50.721 --> 46:54.965
We’re on a break,
or whatever that means.

46:55.045 --> 46:57.728
I mean, he’s cute,
and he’s charming

46:57.808 --> 46:59.650
and a great cook.

46:59.730 --> 47:03.093
It’s just he’s out
of the apartment a lot.

47:03.173 --> 47:06.216
But that does give me
a lot of time to paint.

47:06.296 --> 47:08.819

if I can imagine

47:08.899 --> 47:11.382

not like what you see

47:19.229 --> 47:21.231

47:21.311 --> 47:24.635

dog hair into yarn.

50:05.716 --> 50:07.958
Olsen’s world famous cocoa.

50:08.038 --> 50:10.160
I hope it doesn’t disappoint.

50:10.240 --> 50:12.603
That’d be a first,
in Tinsel anyway.

50:13.724 --> 50:15.606
Mm!
[coughs]

50:15.686 --> 50:17.688
It’s really hot,
but it’s very delicious.

50:17.768 --> 50:18.929
Thank you.

50:19.009 --> 50:20.410
Thanks for joining us.

50:20.490 --> 50:23.774
Oh, of course.
She’s, um, such a sweetie.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.856
Yeah, she is.

50:26.617 --> 50:28.779
Guess that’s because of you.

50:28.859 --> 50:31.181
You two seem like good friends.

50:31.261 --> 50:34.224
She’s my daughter.
I don’t suppose you have any--

50:34.304 --> 50:37.347
Oh, no, just nieces
and nephews.

50:37.427 --> 50:39.309
Just never really
thought about it.

50:39.389 --> 50:40.631
Yeah.

50:40.711 --> 50:43.313
I mean, that’s actually
not true.

50:43.393 --> 50:46.276
I never really thought
about it...

50:46.356 --> 50:48.358
until now.

50:49.359 --> 50:51.922
What, until now?

50:52.002 --> 50:56.607
Yeah, just seeing you guys
like a family.

50:56.687 --> 50:58.248
It’s really sweet.

50:58.328 --> 51:01.451
Sorry.
I told you way too much.

51:01.531 --> 51:04.174
I just have a lot
in my mind right now.

51:05.736 --> 51:07.778
Do you have...

51:07.858 --> 51:09.620
A boyfriend?

51:09.700 --> 51:11.702
Yeah.

51:12.342 --> 51:13.664
It’s complicated.

51:13.744 --> 51:15.065
I’m sorry.
I don’t mean to pry.

51:15.145 --> 51:16.907
No, no, you’re not.

51:16.987 --> 51:18.749
It’s just...

51:18.829 --> 51:21.111
We’re on a break.

51:21.191 --> 51:24.354
He got busy with work,
got a promotion,

51:24.434 --> 51:27.037
while I’m just...

51:27.117 --> 51:29.439
just trying
to figure things out.

51:29.519 --> 51:30.520
Oh.

51:30.601 --> 51:32.683
Specifically where I wanna be.

51:32.763 --> 51:33.924
Is that all?

51:34.004 --> 51:36.006
[laughs]

51:37.327 --> 51:38.809
Do you always keep
a notebook and pencil?

51:38.889 --> 51:43.053
Not always.
Sometimes I type in my phone.

51:43.133 --> 51:45.135
Why?

51:45.736 --> 51:47.377
Ideas come into my head.

51:47.457 --> 51:50.300
I wanna write them down and--
Huh.

51:50.380 --> 51:51.942
What?

51:52.022 --> 51:54.544
I never realized
that I do that.

51:54.625 --> 51:57.347
I’m just surprised
anyone else did.

51:58.709 --> 52:01.632
Well, as a matter of fact,
I...

52:03.513 --> 52:04.955
do the exact same thing.

52:05.035 --> 52:06.196
No way.

52:06.276 --> 52:08.719
I have an idea,
I have to write it down.

52:11.601 --> 52:14.324
Wow. This is amazing.

52:14.404 --> 52:16.206
Did you just do this?

52:16.286 --> 52:18.168
I did it in New York.

52:18.248 --> 52:20.370
Looks just like Tinsel.

Did you hang up a few more

Yeah, well, I could
take a couple down

54:00.390 --> 54:02.392
- Hmm.
- You have to admit

54:02.472 --> 54:04.474
things are going pretty well
with Ava.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.879
Is this your
Christmas presentation?

54:08.959 --> 54:11.882
Yeah. It’s not
quite right yet.

54:11.962 --> 54:14.044
Still have to work
on the speech.

54:14.124 --> 54:15.806
Well, write from your heart.

54:15.886 --> 54:17.888
But now that Ava is helping me
with the official part,

54:17.968 --> 54:19.770
at least that should be okay.

54:19.850 --> 54:21.892
- You lucked out.
- Yeah, well,

54:21.972 --> 54:23.373
I wouldn’t say
I’m the only one.

54:23.453 --> 54:25.976
What are you talking about?

54:26.056 --> 54:28.058
Don’t you like her?

54:28.378 --> 54:30.100
She’s very nice, yeah.

54:30.180 --> 54:32.422
Oh, come on.
You know what I mean.

54:32.502 --> 54:34.945
I’m not sure if I do.

Don’t you like her?

54:36.186 --> 54:38.628
Like her, like her?

54:38.708 --> 54:41.151
I saw the way
you looked at her tonight.

54:43.713 --> 54:45.155
Dad, it’s okay.

54:45.235 --> 54:48.118
I miss Mom very much.

54:48.198 --> 54:50.680
And I know you do too, but...

54:50.760 --> 54:52.803
I don’t think
she’d want you to be alone.

54:52.883 --> 54:55.245
I’m not alone, sweetheart.
I got you, don’t I?

54:55.325 --> 54:57.007
It’s not the same thing.

54:57.087 --> 54:59.089
Plus, I don’t plan on
sticking around here forever.

54:59.169 --> 55:00.851
- Huh?
- I’m going to college.

55:00.931 --> 55:03.653
I’m taking a gap year,
probably in Vienna.

55:03.733 --> 55:05.255
Oh, you’re are, are you?

55:05.335 --> 55:07.337
Dad, Ava’s great.

55:08.578 --> 55:10.260
Don’t stay up too late, okay?

55:10.340 --> 55:12.782

56:43.193 --> 56:46.276
MIA: I’ve never been.
I hear mixed things.

56:46.356 --> 56:48.238
Oh, you do now, do you?

56:48.318 --> 56:50.200
Is it nice?

56:50.280 --> 56:52.602
Oh, I wouldn’t say it’s nice.

56:52.682 --> 56:55.085
You definitely have more room
to spread your wings here.

56:55.165 --> 56:58.328
Sometimes I feel like I’m living
in something about that size.

56:58.408 --> 56:59.569
Those are beautiful.

56:59.649 --> 57:01.411
Yeah, but without
the beautiful.

57:01.491 --> 57:03.053
But you’re right.
They are beautiful.

57:03.133 --> 57:04.454
Such artistry, huh?

57:04.534 --> 57:06.937
Mr. McMurphy makes
all his toys by hand.

57:07.017 --> 57:10.820
People think he spends time
in the North Pole and here.

57:10.900 --> 57:14.304
Yeah, I wouldn’t doubt that
Santa sets up shop here too.

57:14.384 --> 57:17.827
It is a nice place to set up
a shop, don’t you think?

57:19.829 --> 57:23.233
Yeah, it’s perfect.
Little art gallery?

57:23.313 --> 57:25.475
Is that what you want
for Christmas?

57:25.555 --> 57:27.397
[sighs]
That’d be nice.

57:27.477 --> 57:29.479
But sometimes
I’m just a little nervous

57:29.559 --> 57:31.161
to make a big leap like that.

57:31.241 --> 57:32.642
My dad says
sometimes nervous

57:32.722 --> 57:34.804
is just excitement
you don’t recognize.

57:34.884 --> 57:36.886
Your dad said that?

57:36.967 --> 57:38.888
He’s a neat guy, isn’t he?

57:38.969 --> 57:40.450
Yeah.

57:40.530 --> 57:42.852
What do you want
for Christmas, Mia?

57:51.741 --> 57:53.984
[sighs]

57:54.064 --> 57:56.306
- You okay?
- He’s gone.

57:56.386 --> 57:59.069
- Who’s gone?
- I had my heart set

57:59.149 --> 58:01.551
on the most beautiful
little dog, Prancer.

58:01.631 --> 58:03.913
Dad said to give him more time,
and now he’s gone.

58:03.994 --> 58:06.676
Well, you don’t know that.
Maybe he’s just--

58:06.756 --> 58:08.758
What?

58:10.320 --> 58:12.322
There’s always
Santa Claus, right?

58:13.443 --> 58:15.565
You’re a really nice lady, Ava.

58:15.645 --> 58:17.647
Well, thank you.

58:19.489 --> 58:23.813
Do you ever think about
sticking around?

58:23.893 --> 58:25.575
Here, you mean?

58:25.655 --> 58:27.657
Yeah.

58:28.658 --> 58:31.741
Well, between me and you,

58:31.821 --> 58:33.743
I’ve been thinking about it
a lot lately.

58:33.823 --> 58:36.546
- I’d like that.
- You would?

58:36.626 --> 58:39.069
Not as much as a puppy, but...

58:39.149 --> 58:40.550
Okay.

58:40.630 --> 58:42.632
I’ll talk to your dad
about a dog, okay?

58:42.712 --> 58:44.274
You’d do that?

58:44.354 --> 58:46.436
Well, I can’t make any promises,
but I’ll try.

58:53.603 --> 58:56.286
[school bell ringing]

58:58.408 --> 59:00.410
Hi. Hey.

59:02.412 --> 59:05.495
Thank you so much
for coming today, Ava.

59:05.575 --> 59:07.617
Of course. Sorry.
I feel a little awkward,

59:07.697 --> 59:09.299
since I’m not a parent
or guardian, but--

59:09.379 --> 59:11.861
Oh, that’s nonsense.
Nonsense!

59:11.941 --> 59:14.664
When I saw this display,

59:14.744 --> 59:17.827
I just had to meet you
and thank you

59:17.907 --> 59:21.351
for such a beautiful piece
and for helping Mia.

59:21.431 --> 59:23.833
Of course.
You’re very sweet.

59:23.913 --> 59:25.835
I’m so glad
you could come today,

59:25.915 --> 59:28.718
parents and special friends.

59:28.798 --> 59:30.840
Before we dismiss
for Christmas break,

59:30.920 --> 59:33.563
our student of the month,
Mia Miles,

59:33.643 --> 59:36.286
is going to give us
a very special presentation.

59:42.212 --> 59:44.214
That is very cool.

59:45.735 --> 59:47.417
[Mia clears throat]

59:47.497 --> 59:49.619
What’s Christmas all about?

59:49.699 --> 59:52.782
Some people say
it’s about Santa

59:52.862 --> 59:55.105
and presents and puppies.

59:56.746 --> 59:59.028
Other people say
it’s about family

59:59.109 --> 1:00:02.392
and friends
and helping other people

1:00:02.472 --> 1:00:04.234
and a little baby
in the manger.

1:00:04.314 --> 1:00:06.196
To me, it’s all those things.

1:00:06.276 --> 1:00:10.720
But when I think about
how it all started

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:13.643
with a tiny, little star
in the sky...

1:00:13.723 --> 1:00:16.446
But it only looked tiny.
It was huge.

1:00:16.526 --> 1:00:18.448
But it was far away.

1:00:18.528 --> 1:00:20.210
As far away as it was,

1:00:20.290 --> 1:00:22.212
it was still bigger
and brighter

1:00:22.292 --> 1:00:24.254
than any other star
in the sky.

1:00:24.334 --> 1:00:27.457
And people from all over
followed it.

1:00:27.537 --> 1:00:29.979
They wanted to know what it was.

1:00:30.059 --> 1:00:32.702
Angels, shepherds,

1:00:32.782 --> 1:00:36.226
poor people, wise men,

1:00:36.306 --> 1:00:38.548
all just looking for something

1:00:38.628 --> 1:00:41.070
that was missing
in their lives.

1:00:41.151 --> 1:00:43.273
And they were hoping that
that light

1:00:43.353 --> 1:00:46.596
would lead them to something
better and something good.

1:00:46.676 --> 1:00:49.519
And when they found it,
they were all so happy.

1:00:49.599 --> 1:00:52.842
All these different people
from all over

1:00:52.922 --> 1:00:54.604
following something bright,

1:00:54.684 --> 1:00:56.406
something that looks small,

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:58.688
but ended up to change
their world forever

1:00:58.768 --> 1:01:01.090
when they spent that
first Christmas together.

1:01:01.171 --> 1:01:02.892
And ever since then,

1:01:02.972 --> 1:01:05.415
even when we are
miles apart or...

1:01:06.936 --> 1:01:09.179
even departed,

1:01:09.259 --> 1:01:11.301
that Christmas spirit
lives in us all,

1:01:11.381 --> 1:01:12.982
all year long.

1:01:13.062 --> 1:01:15.104
That’s what we celebrate,

1:01:15.185 --> 1:01:17.187
being together on Christmas.

1:01:21.150 --> 1:01:23.233
She is an amazing little girl,
you know.

1:01:23.313 --> 1:01:25.034
I know.

1:01:25.114 --> 1:01:26.436
You know she wants a puppy.

1:01:26.516 --> 1:01:28.278
I know that too.

1:01:28.358 --> 1:01:30.079
It’s hard to say no to that.

1:01:30.159 --> 1:01:31.561
You must have some resolve.

1:01:31.641 --> 1:01:33.042
Yeah.

1:01:33.122 --> 1:01:36.005
That was wonderful, Mia.
Thank you.

1:01:37.607 --> 1:01:40.049

1:11:24.433 --> 1:11:25.474
[phone buzzing]

1:11:25.554 --> 1:11:26.515
Oh, I’m so sorry.

1:11:26.595 --> 1:11:27.837
I have to take this.

1:11:27.917 --> 1:11:30.840
Hello, Bill.
Everything all right?

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:32.922
Don’t they look wonderful
together?

1:11:35.284 --> 1:11:36.445
Oh, yes.

1:11:36.525 --> 1:11:38.327
Okay, so let’s go.

1:11:38.407 --> 1:11:40.089
Oh, no,
but I haven’t eaten yet.

1:11:40.169 --> 1:11:42.411
- Charles!
- I mean, it’s dinner.

1:11:42.491 --> 1:11:44.453
Bill, are you sure this can’t
wait a little longer?

1:11:44.533 --> 1:11:46.856
I’ve already got our plates
ready to go to the office.

1:11:46.936 --> 1:11:49.058
Come on.
Stick to the plan.

1:11:49.138 --> 1:11:52.021
Okay, okay, I’ll be down.

1:11:52.101 --> 1:11:53.502
Is everything okay?

1:11:53.582 --> 1:11:55.704
[sighs]
Oh, it’s Bill.

1:11:55.784 --> 1:11:57.426
Bill?

1:11:57.506 --> 1:11:59.628
Bill from the office.

1:11:59.708 --> 1:12:01.310
Just a little
end-of-the-season business.

1:12:01.390 --> 1:12:02.591
I just need
to get back down there.

1:12:02.671 --> 1:12:05.194
- What, now?
- Right now.

1:12:05.274 --> 1:12:07.396
Okay.

1:12:07.476 --> 1:12:09.398
Mmm! Smells delicious.

1:12:09.478 --> 1:12:11.080
For you and you.

1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:13.002
I need to get back
down to the office.

1:12:13.082 --> 1:12:14.723
Oh, honey,
is everything okay?

1:12:14.803 --> 1:12:16.846
Everything’s great. I just--
You know, my knee,

1:12:16.926 --> 1:12:18.367
I need to get back down there.
I really need a ride.

1:12:18.447 --> 1:12:19.528
I can give you a ride,
if you want.

1:12:19.608 --> 1:12:21.090
Oh, nonsense.

1:12:21.170 --> 1:12:23.732
No, I am already up.
You two are our guests.

1:12:23.812 --> 1:12:26.175
- Enjoy. I’ll take him.
- Thanks, babe.

1:12:26.255 --> 1:12:28.697
Now, dessert is in the fridge.

1:12:28.777 --> 1:12:30.779
Bon appétit.

1:12:49.118 --> 1:12:50.519
AVA: Must be nice to have

1:12:50.599 --> 1:12:52.281
a world-class chef
right next door.

1:12:52.361 --> 1:12:53.923
I am very fortunate.

1:12:54.003 --> 1:12:56.045
She’s a good neighbor.

1:12:56.125 --> 1:12:57.887
She says the same about you.

1:12:57.967 --> 1:12:59.288
You two have gotten close

1:12:59.368 --> 1:13:01.290
while you’ve been here,
haven’t you?

1:13:01.370 --> 1:13:02.451
She’s a neat lady.

1:13:02.531 --> 1:13:04.533
You’re a neat lady.

1:13:06.175 --> 1:13:08.457
What I mean is
you seem like

1:13:08.537 --> 1:13:10.739
you’ve got
a pretty interesting life.

1:13:10.819 --> 1:13:13.262
- I do?
- A New York artist?

1:13:13.342 --> 1:13:15.464
Don’t people dream
of having a life like that?

1:13:15.544 --> 1:13:17.266
I guess you’re right.

1:13:17.346 --> 1:13:19.148
Sometimes the things
you dream about

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:22.471
don’t always add up to the way
life really is though.

1:13:22.551 --> 1:13:25.995
- Yeah?
- The way you want it.

1:13:26.075 --> 1:13:29.798
Not that it’s bad.
It’s just... I don’t know.

1:13:29.878 --> 1:13:31.560
It’s not the way
I thought it would be.

1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:35.004
What’d you think it’d be?

1:13:35.084 --> 1:13:37.086
Honestly?

1:13:37.726 --> 1:13:40.329
Something like this.

1:13:42.451 --> 1:13:46.015
I grew up in a small town
really similar and...

1:13:46.095 --> 1:13:48.617
I don’t know.
It’s just not there anymore.

1:13:48.697 --> 1:13:50.699
Huh.

1:13:51.620 --> 1:13:53.102
What?

1:13:53.182 --> 1:13:55.424
It’s just that I grew up
in a town like this one.

1:13:55.504 --> 1:13:57.146
It’s not really there anymore.

1:13:57.226 --> 1:14:00.389
- The business shut down and...
- Everyone moved away?

1:14:00.469 --> 1:14:03.152
Yeah. I mean,
I can’t blame them.

1:14:03.232 --> 1:14:04.633
I did it too.

1:14:04.713 --> 1:14:06.315
I know exactly what you mean.

1:14:06.395 --> 1:14:08.277
Guess that’s why
I like this place so much.

1:14:08.357 --> 1:14:10.359
It’s why I do.

1:14:13.162 --> 1:14:15.804
Well, not the only reason.

1:14:19.568 --> 1:14:21.570
[door closes]

1:14:22.491 --> 1:14:24.053
We’re back.

1:14:24.133 --> 1:14:27.656
Oh! Thank you so much.

1:14:27.736 --> 1:14:30.299
- Did you enjoy dinner?
- Yes. Dinner was amazing.

1:14:30.379 --> 1:14:32.341
Couldn’t agree more.

1:14:32.421 --> 1:14:33.822
I mean, um...

1:14:33.902 --> 1:14:36.305
What isn’t absolutely amazing?

1:14:36.385 --> 1:14:38.067
Well, you two
must be starving.

1:14:38.147 --> 1:14:39.468
Actually, I’m pretty full.

1:14:39.548 --> 1:14:40.869
- Time for bed.
- Yeah.

1:14:40.949 --> 1:14:44.513
Your knee seems to be better.

1:14:44.593 --> 1:14:46.075
Comes and goes.

1:14:46.155 --> 1:14:48.117
- I should get going.
- Okay.

1:14:48.197 --> 1:14:50.839
Yeah, me too.
It was lovely. Thank you.

1:14:50.919 --> 1:14:52.921
You’re welcome, darlings.

1:15:02.411 --> 1:15:04.413
Thanks again!

1:15:06.695 --> 1:15:09.618
Something tells me
that Charles’ knee is fine,

1:15:09.698 --> 1:15:12.501
and you didn’t have
any business at the office.

1:15:12.581 --> 1:15:15.424
I just thought you two
needed some time alone.

1:15:15.504 --> 1:15:16.825
How’d it go?

1:15:16.905 --> 1:15:18.907
Good night, Deb.

1:15:19.788 --> 1:15:21.550
And, Deb?

1:15:21.630 --> 1:15:23.112
Yes?

1:15:23.192 --> 1:15:25.194
Thank you.

1:15:25.274 --> 1:15:27.276
You’re welcome.

1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:33.802
Yes!

1:15:34.723 --> 1:15:36.725
AVA: Dinner was so great.

1:15:39.168 --> 1:15:41.250
Well...

1:15:41.330 --> 1:15:43.452
Well, good night.

1:15:43.532 --> 1:15:45.294
Good night.

1:15:45.374 --> 1:15:48.937
Wow. It’s a really starry night.

1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:53.422
I wonder.

1:15:53.502 --> 1:15:55.464
What?

1:15:55.544 --> 1:15:57.546
What’s that?

1:15:58.187 --> 1:16:01.070
That one is
Cassiopeia and Cepheus.

1:16:01.150 --> 1:16:02.871
Who?

1:16:02.951 --> 1:16:04.953
Let me show you.

1:16:08.637 --> 1:16:10.799
So Cassiopeia
was very beautiful,

1:16:10.879 --> 1:16:12.921
but also extremely vain.

1:16:13.001 --> 1:16:15.604
And one day she insisted
that she was more beautiful

1:16:15.684 --> 1:16:17.366
than the Zeus’ wife, Hera,

1:16:17.446 --> 1:16:18.847
which led to
Hera tying her up

1:16:18.927 --> 1:16:21.130
and sending her off
into the stars.

1:16:21.210 --> 1:16:23.412
When King Cepheus,
Cassiopeia’s husband,

1:16:23.492 --> 1:16:25.494
found out about this,
he was heartbroken.

1:16:25.574 --> 1:16:27.015
So rather than be without her,

1:16:27.096 --> 1:16:29.178
he begged Zeus to be
sent off into the stars,

1:16:29.258 --> 1:16:31.180
so that he could be
with his wife.

1:16:31.260 --> 1:16:33.942
And that bright light
that you see?

1:16:34.022 --> 1:16:37.186
That’s the two of them
clinging together...

1:16:37.266 --> 1:16:38.707
forever.

1:16:38.787 --> 1:16:41.390
Wow. It’s beautiful.

1:16:41.470 --> 1:16:44.433
It’s also a little sad.

1:16:44.513 --> 1:16:46.555
Yeah, I guess it is.

1:16:46.635 --> 1:16:48.837
MIA: Dad, there’s someone here
to see you.

1:16:48.917 --> 1:16:50.919
[knocking]

1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:53.041
Can I help you?

1:16:53.122 --> 1:16:54.963
Yeah, I was looking for--

1:16:55.043 --> 1:16:57.126
- Dean?
- Ava?

1:17:03.692 --> 1:17:05.414
Dean, what are you doing?

1:17:05.494 --> 1:17:06.895
Packing.

1:17:06.975 --> 1:17:09.258
That’s my suitcase.

1:17:09.338 --> 1:17:10.539
Mm-hmm.

1:17:10.619 --> 1:17:11.860
How did you get here
so fast?

1:17:11.940 --> 1:17:14.303
[scoffs] Hey, it’s good
to see you too.

1:17:14.383 --> 1:17:16.185
No, that’s not what I meant.
I just--

1:17:16.265 --> 1:17:18.187
I thought you were
going to New York.

1:17:18.267 --> 1:17:19.348
Change of plans.

1:17:19.428 --> 1:17:20.669
What?

1:17:20.749 --> 1:17:22.431
After I got off the phone
with you,

1:17:22.511 --> 1:17:24.953
the CEO met with me.

1:17:25.033 --> 1:17:27.356
This apparently wasn’t
just a retreat.

1:17:27.436 --> 1:17:28.957
It was an interview.

1:17:29.037 --> 1:17:30.959
And it wasn’t
just a promotion.

1:17:31.039 --> 1:17:33.562
They want me to run
the entire Denver office.

1:17:33.642 --> 1:17:35.884
They tripled my salary.

1:17:35.964 --> 1:17:37.446
- Denver.
- Yeah!

1:17:37.526 --> 1:17:39.168
They’re transferring me
out of the city.

1:17:39.248 --> 1:17:40.369
Out of the city?

1:17:40.449 --> 1:17:41.690
Don’t you see?

1:17:41.770 --> 1:17:43.692
We both get what we want.

1:17:43.772 --> 1:17:46.575
I get my dream job,
and you get out of the city.

1:17:46.655 --> 1:17:48.857
Well, what do you say?

1:17:48.937 --> 1:17:51.300
I figured why not swing by,
pick you up,

1:17:51.380 --> 1:17:53.662
and we’ll spend Christmas
in our new home together

1:17:53.742 --> 1:17:54.943
and check it out.

1:17:55.023 --> 1:17:57.586
This is happening
way too fast.

1:17:57.666 --> 1:17:59.188
Merry Christmas.

1:17:59.268 --> 1:18:02.150
- Where are you going?
- I need to go for a walk.

1:18:13.402 --> 1:18:15.324
What am I gonna do with you?

1:18:15.404 --> 1:18:17.606
Don’t worry yourself too much.

1:18:17.686 --> 1:18:19.808
But I do worry
about you, Mason.

1:18:19.888 --> 1:18:22.090
I saw the way
she looks at you.

1:18:22.170 --> 1:18:24.613
More importantly, I saw
the way you looked at her.

1:18:24.693 --> 1:18:26.655
I have no idea
what you’re talking about.

1:18:26.735 --> 1:18:29.498
Oh, for the first time
in years,

1:18:29.578 --> 1:18:31.780
you got a little twinkle
in your eye,

1:18:31.860 --> 1:18:33.982
a little pep in your step.

1:18:34.062 --> 1:18:36.465
Did you notice that
her boyfriend surprised her

1:18:36.545 --> 1:18:38.427
from out of town?

1:18:38.507 --> 1:18:41.630
Kinda figured
that’s who that fellow was.

1:18:41.710 --> 1:18:43.632
You know, if I didn’t
like you so much,

1:18:43.712 --> 1:18:46.795
I’d be concerned about
all the spying you do on me.

1:18:46.875 --> 1:18:48.116
Whatever.

1:18:48.196 --> 1:18:49.638
Have you kissed her?

1:18:49.718 --> 1:18:52.160
- What?
- Simple question.

1:18:52.241 --> 1:18:54.443
Well, I was about to,

1:18:54.523 --> 1:18:56.925
and then her boyfriend
barged in.

1:18:58.647 --> 1:19:00.649
You do care about her
though, right?

1:19:01.610 --> 1:19:02.931
We just met.

1:19:03.011 --> 1:19:06.054
That’s not what I asked you,
Mason.

1:19:06.134 --> 1:19:10.299
Taking chances is like
the best part of being alive.

1:19:10.379 --> 1:19:12.701
And if you don’t show her
how you really feel,

1:19:12.781 --> 1:19:14.703
you’re gonna spend
the rest of your life

1:19:14.783 --> 1:19:16.385
wondering, "What if?"

1:19:16.465 --> 1:19:18.307
Why is this
so important to you?

1:19:18.387 --> 1:19:21.590
Because you’re my friend,
and you’re a wonderful father.

1:19:23.231 --> 1:19:25.193
And I wanna see you happy.

1:19:25.274 --> 1:19:28.156
But you have to have
the courage to want it too.

1:19:30.078 --> 1:19:32.761
I also think you look more
handsome when you’re happy too.

1:19:32.841 --> 1:19:34.843
[chuckles]

1:19:34.923 --> 1:19:36.925
Good night, Mason.

1:19:38.487 --> 1:19:40.489
Good night.

1:19:42.811 --> 1:19:43.932
DEAN: Ava!

1:19:44.012 --> 1:19:46.415
Hey, what is wrong?

1:19:46.495 --> 1:19:48.617
I figured you’d be thrilled.

1:19:48.697 --> 1:19:50.379
You’re right, okay?

1:19:50.459 --> 1:19:51.860
I do need a change
from the city.

1:19:51.940 --> 1:19:53.782
Well, then let’s go to Denver.

1:19:53.862 --> 1:19:54.983
You didn’t even ask.

1:19:55.063 --> 1:19:56.705
What are you talking about?

1:19:56.785 --> 1:19:58.707
Of course you’re invited.

1:19:58.787 --> 1:20:01.109
You can’t just make executive
decisions about my life.

1:20:01.189 --> 1:20:03.592
- Ava...
- No.

1:20:03.672 --> 1:20:07.316
Dean, I know that we both want
different things now.

1:20:07.396 --> 1:20:09.918
If your boss asked you
to move to Timbuktu, you would,

1:20:09.998 --> 1:20:11.640
which is something
that I love about you.

1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:13.722
But I need to know that you
have the same love for me,

1:20:13.802 --> 1:20:15.804
and you don’t.

1:20:17.646 --> 1:20:20.889
I love you, but...

1:20:20.969 --> 1:20:25.173
I’m just not in love
with you anymore.

1:20:25.253 --> 1:20:28.016
This is a break-up.

- Yeah.

He’s getting transferred
to Denver.

1:23:08.016 --> 1:23:09.978
Oh. Found it.

1:23:10.058 --> 1:23:12.060
Thanks.

So you’re moving to Denver.

1:23:59.187 --> 1:24:03.031
I went to the pound with Ava,
and Prancer was gone.

1:24:03.111 --> 1:24:06.074
Was kinda hoping to find him
here on Christmas morning.

1:24:06.154 --> 1:24:08.236
Sweetheart, I’m sorry,

1:24:08.316 --> 1:24:11.079
but I couldn’t very well
keep him quiet

1:24:11.159 --> 1:24:13.802

now, could I?

I spoke with them and told them
I wanted the puppy

1:24:40.108 --> 1:24:41.750
and to just hold him
until Christmas

1:24:41.830 --> 1:24:43.471
when I pick him up.
Simple.

Mom and Dad usually stay
in the guest room,

1:24:56.164 --> 1:24:59.127

they’d stay in the guesthouse.

1:24:59.207 --> 1:25:01.169
Then where will I stay?

1:25:01.249 --> 1:25:03.451
I’m sure we can
figure something out.
