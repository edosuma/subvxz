WEBVTT

00:05.181 --> 00:06.482
It's freaking creepy.

00:06.483 --> 00:09.017
- Is it dangerous?
- Yes.

00:09.018 --> 00:11.620
It's a matter of life or death.

00:11.621 --> 00:13.665
In this life, you think
you're being punished?

00:13.666 --> 00:15.367
That's what it feels like.

00:15.368 --> 00:17.302
I don't like this.

00:17.303 --> 00:20.005
This is what was on my leg.

00:20.006 --> 00:22.508
It was over there, and then it ran.

00:22.509 --> 00:24.976
And just all of a sudden went clang!

00:24.977 --> 00:28.697
This is the guy with the axe.

00:29.512 --> 00:31.625
He's crazy.

00:31.626 --> 00:34.386
Like, sociopathic.

00:35.822 --> 00:38.151
They're being watched.

00:38.152 --> 00:41.252
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.253 --> 00:43.454
This thing likes death.

00:43.455 --> 00:44.896
I see dead people.

00:44.897 --> 00:46.560
This thing's, like, a monster.

00:46.561 --> 00:48.596
I speak to dead people.

00:48.597 --> 00:50.130
And he's pissed off now.

00:50.131 --> 00:51.799
And they speak to me.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.521
His head was cracked.

00:53.522 --> 00:56.937
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.938 --> 00:58.539
This guy was murdered.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.107
I rely on my partner.

01:00.108 --> 01:03.377
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:03.378 --> 01:05.880
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:05.881 --> 01:09.249
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.684
You saw her?

01:10.685 --> 01:11.919
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.148
Why would you stay here?

01:13.149 --> 01:15.270
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.271 --> 01:17.324
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.325 --> 01:18.692
Until the very end.

01:18.693 --> 01:20.528
Stop it.

01:20.529 --> 01:22.496
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

01:22.497 --> 01:24.998
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:24.999 --> 01:26.400
Or time to get out.

01:26.401 --> 01:31.081
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.490 --> 01:53.410
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:54.365 --> 01:58.198
I interview witnesses and research
the history of each location.

01:58.199 --> 02:01.335
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:01.336 --> 02:07.236
At the end, we reveal our findings
to our clients and each other.

02:07.642 --> 02:12.145
I'm in Bloomington, Illinois, a
couple of hours outside of Chicago.

02:12.146 --> 02:16.445
I'm heading over to meet
with a mom named Diane.

02:16.446 --> 02:20.020
She told me on the phone that there's a lot
of weird things happening in her house.

02:20.021 --> 02:23.176
But the worst thing, the thing
that's keeping her up at night,

02:23.177 --> 02:27.361
is she thinks the spirits are targeting
her son, who has special needs.

02:27.362 --> 02:31.982
Let's see if Amy and I can help her out.

02:37.189 --> 02:42.042
Before Amy arrives, I clear the
area of any leading information.

02:42.043 --> 02:44.735
You can tell a lot about
the occupants of a house

02:44.736 --> 02:48.936
from their photos and religious icons.

02:50.318 --> 02:56.218
I have to hide these items so
Amy isn't influenced by them.

03:09.239 --> 03:11.440
As I open to communicate with the dead,

03:11.441 --> 03:14.408
I begin picking up on flashes
of death in the area,

03:14.409 --> 03:18.569
and one entity in particular
appears to be very dangerous.

03:18.570 --> 03:22.170
I saw this man with an axe.

03:22.785 --> 03:26.805
He smiles at me, and I feel sick.

03:35.176 --> 03:39.299
I said, hey, I'm here, you know,
if anybody wants to talk.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.795
Or tell your story.

03:41.796 --> 03:47.696
And they said, no, you're not.
You're here to get rid of us.

03:48.810 --> 03:53.146
And it sounded like a
young male and a girl.

03:53.147 --> 03:56.054
They think that I'm lying, that I'm
not here just to tell their story.

03:56.055 --> 04:01.875
I'm here to, like, get rid of
them, and that's not good.

04:15.870 --> 04:18.233
Okay, Diane, so, what's going on?

04:18.233 --> 04:22.654
Ever since we built the house
about eight years ago.

04:22.655 --> 04:25.297
We've heard footsteps.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.411
We've seen apparitions.

04:27.412 --> 04:31.355
And it has began physically touching us.

04:31.356 --> 04:35.534
And that has me really concerned
because my son, Zach.

04:35.535 --> 04:37.825
Has muscular dystrophy.

04:37.826 --> 04:40.728
- Oh, geez. How old is he?
- He's 15.

04:40.729 --> 04:44.832
And it's left him using
a wheelchair full time.

04:44.833 --> 04:47.768
Okay, why are you calling us
in now, what's the story?

04:47.769 --> 04:53.641
It's gotten to the point where he's having
issues that doctors cannot explain,

04:53.642 --> 04:55.175
and also my health.

04:55.176 --> 04:56.894
Okay, in what way?

04:56.895 --> 05:00.480
Unfortunately, I've had
to have surgery twice,

05:00.481 --> 05:04.718
to deal with the pain that
I've been experiencing.

05:04.719 --> 05:07.888
Do you think it's something in the house
that may be causing the problems?

05:07.889 --> 05:09.289
I think it is.

05:09.290 --> 05:12.425
Can you show me some places in the house
where you've been experiencing things?

05:12.426 --> 05:14.286
Yes.

05:21.970 --> 05:26.439
I was getting ready to make
dinner, and I looked up.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.440
I saw an apparition.

05:29.976 --> 05:31.644
Okay, describe it to me.

05:31.645 --> 05:37.405
He appeared to be, like, a rancher
with a hat, work boots, cowboy boots.

05:37.406 --> 05:39.102
From what time period? You have any idea?

05:39.103 --> 05:41.822
I would guess the late 1800s.

05:41.823 --> 05:46.395
And one time, I was actually
pushed in this room.

05:46.396 --> 05:47.423
Pushed?

05:47.424 --> 05:51.864
Definitely felt a hand, and I was moved.

05:55.236 --> 05:58.296
I'm seeing this guy.

05:58.673 --> 06:02.933
The man from my opening with the axe.

06:04.846 --> 06:07.320
The man with the axe has
followed me into the house

06:07.321 --> 06:10.550
and is staring me down,
trying to intimidate me.

06:10.551 --> 06:14.189
I think he enjoys
tormenting the living here.

06:14.190 --> 06:16.537
Can you describe him?

06:16.538 --> 06:19.214
He's wearing a white...

06:19.215 --> 06:23.061
Long-sleeved shirt with two
buttons and suspenders.

06:23.062 --> 06:24.865
He's pretty solid.

06:24.866 --> 06:30.686
And usually, the solid ones are
more capable of interacting.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.810
He's crazy.

06:36.242 --> 06:39.002
Like, sociopathic.

06:43.718 --> 06:49.156
Ever since we moved in, anytime I've
been down here doing the laundry,

06:49.157 --> 06:52.952
I kind of catch something
on the corner of my eye.

06:52.953 --> 06:57.117
It looks like a dark figure, kind of short.

06:57.118 --> 07:00.324
Looks kind of like it
has maybe a hunchback.

07:00.325 --> 07:03.745
Just goes by real quickly.

07:04.271 --> 07:08.531
I saw it today when I was down here.

07:10.411 --> 07:14.490
- It made me feel really sick.
- You okay? Yeah?

07:14.491 --> 07:16.411
Yeah.

07:16.858 --> 07:21.554
If Amy tells you it's not safe for you
to be here, what are you gonna do?

07:21.555 --> 07:24.345
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

07:24.346 --> 07:28.025
My son, he needs a lot
more care in this house.

07:28.026 --> 07:31.865
We have done everything to try
to make it adaptable for him,

07:31.866 --> 07:37.766
so it wouldn't be easy for us, you
know, just to simply pack up and move.

07:37.950 --> 07:43.850
It's a matter of life or death,
and I don't like to give up.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.538
So, I see this doll thing.

08:03.544 --> 08:07.684
It was over there, and then it ran.

08:10.679 --> 08:12.881
It, like...

08:12.882 --> 08:14.792
Went in here.

08:14.793 --> 08:19.773
And it's all black...
like, solid, solid black.

08:21.182 --> 08:26.119
The man with the axe and the
little doll thing are related,

08:26.120 --> 08:29.300
but I don't know how.

08:30.172 --> 08:33.001
I don't think it wants me to...

08:33.003 --> 08:35.763
Know what it is.

08:37.530 --> 08:42.135
Or where it came from or why
it's here or what it's doing.

08:42.135 --> 08:46.023
So it does have some kind
of consciousness to it.

08:46.024 --> 08:49.264
Is it dangerous at all?

08:49.327 --> 08:51.187
Yes.

08:58.452 --> 09:00.854
Okay, what's going on in here?

09:00.855 --> 09:04.724
I was actually scratched across my leg.

09:04.725 --> 09:06.994
Do you have animals in the house?

09:06.995 --> 09:12.895
We have a couple of cats, but these scratch
marks are larger than a cat's claw.

09:14.781 --> 09:18.381
This is what was on my leg.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.900
That's too big to be a cat.

09:21.901 --> 09:24.559
Okay, anything else going
on in the bedroom?

09:24.560 --> 09:27.500
Another time, I was lying in bed,

09:27.501 --> 09:31.818
and I heard footsteps
coming across the floor.

09:31.819 --> 09:34.888
And I felt a finger poke me.

09:34.889 --> 09:37.057
Were you laying in bed with
your husband or just you?

09:37.058 --> 09:39.368
No, it was just me.

09:39.369 --> 09:41.245
Is that all that's going
on, or you got more?

09:41.246 --> 09:42.815
No.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.956
I heard someone whisper in my ear...

09:47.201 --> 09:52.301
I had a little bit less
than two years to live.

09:52.501 --> 09:54.408
- Male or a female?
- Female.

09:54.409 --> 10:00.309
- How long ago was that?
- A little bit less than two years ago.

10:03.302 --> 10:07.562
Like, I'm hearing a child's laughter.

10:08.838 --> 10:14.127
I don't like it, you know?
It makes me uncomfortable.

10:14.128 --> 10:16.948
So, it's, like...

10:16.975 --> 10:19.230
This girl...

10:19.231 --> 10:23.731
She's developed a twisted sense of humor.

10:24.973 --> 10:27.363
And what she does is,

10:27.364 --> 10:31.012
like, crawling under the bed and
doing bad things under the bed,

10:31.013 --> 10:34.253
like coming up and out.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.158
It's freaking creepy.

10:53.953 --> 10:58.507
I feel like someone is
having issues with the bed.

10:58.508 --> 11:01.328
This girl child...

11:01.448 --> 11:06.406
Is, like, crawling under the bed and
doing bad things under the bed,

11:06.407 --> 11:09.647
like coming up and out.

11:11.456 --> 11:13.557
It's freaking creepy.

11:13.558 --> 11:17.191
I don't like this. She's
wearing a little...

11:17.192 --> 11:21.065
Like, a little dress that
poufs out like that.

11:21.066 --> 11:23.046
And...

11:23.182 --> 11:25.329
I don't know if they see her like that.

11:25.330 --> 11:28.271
I see, like, more of like a mist.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.152
Very, yeah, creepy.

11:43.944 --> 11:47.186
So, Zach, I was talking with mom, and she
was telling me about some of the things

11:47.187 --> 11:49.587
that are going on in his house
since you guys moved in.

11:49.588 --> 11:51.072
Mm-hmm.

11:51.073 --> 11:53.342
So, what about yourself?
What are you experiencing?

11:53.343 --> 11:56.264
One night, I was laying in bed,

11:56.265 --> 12:00.357
and I saw these kids playing on the floor.

12:00.358 --> 12:03.404
- How old would you say they were?
- About 7.

12:03.405 --> 12:06.674
And then they looked up,
and they just vanished.

12:06.675 --> 12:09.130
Okay. What else are you experiencing?

12:09.131 --> 12:14.119
Uh well, one night, I heard someone
rummaging through the drawers,

12:14.120 --> 12:16.918
out in the kitchen.

12:16.919 --> 12:20.822
And I was scared, so I just sat in my bed.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.378
I was so scared. I thought
someone was in the house.

12:24.379 --> 12:27.580
- Nobody was in the kitchen?
- No.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.306
- Are you having trouble sleeping?
- Yeah.

12:31.307 --> 12:36.156
Normally, it takes like three
hours for me to go to sleep.

12:36.157 --> 12:39.248
- Are you hearing anything?
- Yeah, whispers.

12:39.249 --> 12:41.661
Like a female whisper.

12:41.662 --> 12:45.190
- And what is she saying?
- It's kind of mumbling.

12:45.191 --> 12:49.511
Something like this, like, really quiet.

12:55.835 --> 12:59.075
This girl, she's young.

13:02.669 --> 13:05.972
Do you have any idea what...
what she's doing?

13:05.973 --> 13:08.689
She's messing with the people.

13:08.690 --> 13:12.550
So, it's like, you'd be in the
bed, and you would feel like

13:12.551 --> 13:16.337
there was something crawling
around under your bed.

13:16.338 --> 13:20.599
Then she likes to come up
out from under the bed.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.380
And go up the side and on it.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.306
This is creepy.

13:30.697 --> 13:34.139
Now, as far as the room goes,
what else are you experiencing?

13:34.140 --> 13:36.796
Some soldiers here.

13:36.797 --> 13:38.838
And where were they, just
standing in the room here?

13:38.839 --> 13:41.314
Yeah, they were standing and looking at me.

13:41.315 --> 13:46.115
And then they... one of
them started talking.

13:46.146 --> 13:48.496
He said, we'll be back.

13:48.497 --> 13:51.230
Like they were gonna come back to
see you again, what'd that mean?

13:51.231 --> 13:55.621
Like, not scare me but
come back after I die.

13:55.622 --> 13:59.036
Now, what do you think is causing all
these visions of you seeing these guys?

13:59.037 --> 14:01.168
I think I was previously...

14:01.169 --> 14:02.874
Uh, a soldier.

14:02.875 --> 14:08.775
Like, I was reincarnated as this
person for doing something bad.

14:09.469 --> 14:12.047
Now that you're in this life, you
think you're being punished?

14:12.048 --> 14:15.948
Yeah. That's what it feels like.

14:24.918 --> 14:27.655
You know Mark, talking to
Diane, she was saying that uh,

14:27.656 --> 14:31.331
she thinks that whatever's going on in the
house is affecting her and Zach physically.

14:31.332 --> 14:33.164
Um, how do you feel about all that?

14:33.165 --> 14:38.203
I've seen them in pain and
upset, and it's frustrating.

14:38.204 --> 14:40.450
Are you experiencing anything here?

14:40.451 --> 14:44.281
Just recently, I placed
those tubs over there.

14:44.282 --> 14:47.868
Like that blue one right there,
bent down to put it down,

14:47.869 --> 14:51.850
and that clear plastic container
falls off the shelf...

14:51.851 --> 14:55.512
And just all of a sudden went clang!
Lands right in front of my head.

14:55.513 --> 14:57.395
Was it top-heavy, anything
in it that made it...

14:57.396 --> 14:58.957
It was empty just like it is now.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.341
- Was the cat down here maybe?
- No.

15:01.342 --> 15:03.395
I have no idea how that could've happened.

15:03.396 --> 15:07.476
That's kind of like a violent act.

15:12.729 --> 15:15.206
I'm seeing that guy again.

15:15.207 --> 15:18.927
This is the guy with the axe.

15:21.931 --> 15:24.783
He looks at me, and he smiles.

15:24.784 --> 15:27.908
And I didn't get a good feeling from him.

15:27.909 --> 15:30.988
I think that he got murdered.

15:30.989 --> 15:33.674
And so he's angry.

15:33.675 --> 15:38.226
Not a good combination for some
dead person you want in your house.

15:38.227 --> 15:40.264
He's crazy..

15:40.265 --> 15:43.325
He... was a murderer.

15:55.332 --> 15:57.363
Now that I've spoken to the witnesses,

15:57.364 --> 15:59.552
I need to find out what
was on Diane's property

15:59.553 --> 16:03.975
before the house was built
just eight 1/2 years ago.

16:03.976 --> 16:06.144
I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian,

16:06.145 --> 16:10.825
and I'm hoping he has some answers for me.

16:19.310 --> 16:22.527
The house I'm investigating,
it's only eight 1/2 years old.

16:22.528 --> 16:26.465
I was wondering if you could help me out
and tell me what was there before that.

16:26.466 --> 16:32.366
It was a farm, over 300 acres at
one time, owned by William King.

16:32.804 --> 16:38.686
Came from Pennsylvania with his first
wife and four children in 1836.

16:38.687 --> 16:43.482
And the Kings owned the farm
right up until the 1950s.

16:43.483 --> 16:46.651
What can you tell me about William
King himself, what kind of guy was he?

16:46.652 --> 16:50.689
He had built a house. He had
become a successful farmer.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.998
So, he had accomplished a great deal

16:52.999 --> 16:57.818
and probably thought he had much
more time to accomplish more.

16:57.819 --> 17:02.128
But he died on the farm
at the age of 41 years.

17:02.129 --> 17:05.669
It was a very tragic thing.

17:09.301 --> 17:14.512
The man with the axe, like, I don't
even know where this guy came from.

17:14.513 --> 17:17.138
Do you have any idea why he's here?

17:17.140 --> 17:21.400
I see him, like, working on the land.

17:22.255 --> 17:25.290
- Like, maybe he owned it.
- Okay.

17:25.290 --> 17:30.429
The weird thing is, now he's wearing
a suit, pants... nice pants.

17:30.430 --> 17:33.310
Like he's wealthy.

17:33.525 --> 17:37.605
And he's probably like in his 40s.

17:39.405 --> 17:43.207
So, he comes here with his wife and
four kids, how's life for them?

17:43.208 --> 17:46.602
They had a great many challenges here.

17:46.603 --> 17:52.316
At the age of 29, his first wife,
Amelia, died in childbirth.

17:52.317 --> 17:55.634
And two of his boys died
when they were young.

17:55.635 --> 17:59.357
Okay, so we can assume at least two of the
kids and Amelia died on the property.

17:59.358 --> 18:02.255
- Yes.
- Okay. Now, he remarries?

18:02.256 --> 18:06.612
He remarried, and they proceeded
to have many more children.

18:06.613 --> 18:08.457
Now, Bill, do you know
about any other deaths

18:08.458 --> 18:11.258
associated with the King
family on the property itself?

18:11.259 --> 18:12.877
Yes.

18:12.878 --> 18:15.233
William's son George,

18:15.234 --> 18:19.333
died under very strange
circumstances in the 1870s.

18:19.334 --> 18:21.200
Okay. How did he die?

18:21.201 --> 18:24.358
The paper which describes
the incident in some length

18:24.359 --> 18:28.259
doesn't really know why he died.

18:32.606 --> 18:35.133
Bill didn't know too much
about George's death,

18:35.134 --> 18:37.657
but I've tracked down a historian who does.

18:37.658 --> 18:43.558
So, I'm heading over to his farm to find
out what made this death so mysterious.

18:51.777 --> 18:55.184
George was 24, almost 25 when he died.

18:55.185 --> 18:59.804
He was kind of a wild kid. Uh,
he'd been a partyer, a drinker.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.307
Unlike his father, who was
a justice of the peace

19:02.308 --> 19:05.241
and active in the community
and very well-respected.

19:05.242 --> 19:08.593
Now, did George ever run the
farm or take over at any point?

19:08.594 --> 19:12.764
No. The farm went to Zephaniah,
his younger brother.

19:12.765 --> 19:14.680
Not George.

19:14.681 --> 19:18.608
This is the chain of deeds,
and George was never on it.

19:18.609 --> 19:20.416
Which is not common.

19:20.417 --> 19:23.475
No. Ordinarily, it would've
gone to the oldest

19:23.476 --> 19:25.944
son that was available to run the farm.

19:25.945 --> 19:30.505
But George was unreliable, and the family
depended on the farm for an income.

19:30.506 --> 19:33.561
And couldn't turn it over to
somebody they couldn't trust.

19:33.562 --> 19:35.482
Okay.

19:47.466 --> 19:50.101
There's these two men, and they're
yelling, they're yelling.

19:50.102 --> 19:53.404
They're fighting each other.
They're punching each other.

19:53.405 --> 19:57.005
And it's getting really bad.

19:59.011 --> 20:02.728
This one guy really, really
wants to see the other one dead

20:02.729 --> 20:07.910
because he's preventing him
from having what he wants.

20:07.911 --> 20:11.130
I think it's a land thing.

20:11.131 --> 20:13.191
Can you describe either of them at all?

20:13.192 --> 20:16.342
Well, one dude, he's
probably in his mid 20s,

20:16.343 --> 20:19.644
and he's got light brown eyes
and the blond hair and...

20:19.645 --> 20:23.365
Do you get any names on them?

20:23.593 --> 20:26.293
I get a George.

20:27.551 --> 20:32.285
But people don't like him because,
you know, he's (Bleep) crazy.

20:32.286 --> 20:35.276
Now, I heard that George
died kind of mysteriously.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.355
Do you know anything about that?

20:37.356 --> 20:41.136
I found this article from 1875.

20:42.006 --> 20:45.303
Apparently, George was over
at the house for dinner.

20:45.304 --> 20:48.877
He took a nap on the couch, and they saw he
was still asleep when it was time to eat,

20:48.878 --> 20:50.836
so they went ahead and ate without him.

20:50.837 --> 20:56.734
After dinner, they were all
outside, and a gunshot was heard.

20:56.735 --> 20:58.899
So they rushed into the
house, and there was George,

20:58.900 --> 21:01.344
laying there on the sofa
with a hole in his chest.

21:01.345 --> 21:03.330
- Okay, was he dead already?
- No.

21:03.331 --> 21:05.606
They revived him enough that he could talk,

21:05.607 --> 21:08.210
and he hold them it was...
it was an accident.

21:08.211 --> 21:13.282
He was exchanging his gun from his
pants pocket to his vest pocket.

21:13.283 --> 21:15.918
And it went off at that point.

21:15.919 --> 21:19.459
He died a short time later.

21:22.639 --> 21:26.966
They're fighting each other, and
I see the blood in the dirt,

21:26.967 --> 21:30.813
and there's dirt being
kicked up in a cloud.

21:30.814 --> 21:33.916
And everybody's like, oh, my God! Aah!

21:33.917 --> 21:36.544
Oh, no! You know, and freaking out.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.950
Do you know if either of
them were successful?

21:38.951 --> 21:43.468
I don't think that anybody
got killed in the fight.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.728
But I see, like, the blond.

21:46.729 --> 21:50.599
He's, like, in this little house.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.920
And there's a table, like, to eat at.

21:57.441 --> 22:01.401
And I see him, like, in darkness.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.620
And I hear the sound of a gun go off.

22:06.749 --> 22:08.669
Dead.

22:17.497 --> 22:19.777
With five deaths involving the King family,

22:19.778 --> 22:21.646
who lived on the property
I'm investigating,

22:21.647 --> 22:26.367
Diane's house might as
well sit in a graveyard.

22:26.368 --> 22:31.228
But I need to know if
there's anything else.

22:33.825 --> 22:35.164
Digging through the archives,

22:35.165 --> 22:41.065
I discovered that something called a poor
farm once operated right next to her home.

22:42.133 --> 22:46.867
But the records don't explain
what the hell a poor farm is.

22:46.868 --> 22:49.369
So, I'm on my way to meet
with a local archivist,

22:49.370 --> 22:55.270
who says it represents a very dark
chapter in Bloomington's history.

23:04.852 --> 23:09.436
A poor farm was an institution
run by the County,

23:09.437 --> 23:14.092
that would care for those who were
unable to care for themselves...

23:14.093 --> 23:17.745
The mentally ill, the
physically disabled...

23:17.746 --> 23:20.266
The uh, poor.

23:20.333 --> 23:26.233
Kind of those on the outside of society
where the social safety net had failed.

23:26.705 --> 23:29.446
We happen to have at the McLean
County Museum of History

23:29.447 --> 23:35.347
several photographs of the poor farm, and
here's one of the complex of buildings.

23:35.924 --> 23:37.257
Wow.

23:37.258 --> 23:42.428
The poor farm in McLean County
was established in 1859, 1860.

23:42.429 --> 23:45.666
What about deaths on the property?
Were there any reported deaths there?

23:45.667 --> 23:47.835
We do have a death and burial record.

23:47.836 --> 23:52.707
The Superintendent said there
were at least 173 known burials.

23:52.708 --> 23:58.608
And at least 300-plus others buried
on the site with no markers.

24:04.820 --> 24:07.235
There's, like...

24:07.236 --> 24:10.116
All these people...

24:11.317 --> 24:13.346
Like...

24:13.347 --> 24:16.947
Walking around back in there.

24:19.353 --> 24:22.893
Really poor, like, no money.

24:24.625 --> 24:30.196
I do feel like there's a place that
this is all coming from or something.

24:30.197 --> 24:33.388
Any idea what kind of time
frame this might be in?

24:33.389 --> 24:37.349
1880s to like 1910, I'm thinking.

24:41.308 --> 24:43.443
What were the conditions like?

24:43.444 --> 24:48.290
There was not really an attempt made to
rehabilitate or care for these people.

24:48.291 --> 24:49.104
Okay.

24:49.105 --> 24:52.318
So, they provided room and
board and little else.

24:52.319 --> 24:57.090
Local clergy would make appearances
on Sunday for church services.

24:57.091 --> 25:00.098
Local physicians would care for the people,

25:00.099 --> 25:03.462
provide some basic needs for these folks.

25:03.463 --> 25:09.341
In 1877, the Daily Pantagraph, which is
the longtime newspaper for Bloomington...

25:09.342 --> 25:12.913
A reporter went out there and
called the McLean County poor farm

25:12.914 --> 25:18.254
one of the saddest sights
that mortal eyes can view.

25:19.180 --> 25:22.348
In 1915, an Inspector with
the state of Illinois

25:22.349 --> 25:25.303
made an appearance at the
McLean County poor farm.

25:25.304 --> 25:28.735
And said that the livestock,
the cattle and hogs.

25:28.736 --> 25:34.636
Were better cared for and had
better housing than the inmates.

25:36.964 --> 25:40.167
Their clothes are all ripped up and stuff,

25:40.168 --> 25:43.103
and they don't have shoes, a lot of them.

25:43.104 --> 25:46.764
They're not carrying anything.

25:47.074 --> 25:51.578
I see, like, a big sign
that says, religion on it.

25:51.579 --> 25:57.044
There's, like, all these people
that are, like, coming out.

25:57.045 --> 26:00.820
And they're all, like, kind
of scared of something.

26:00.821 --> 26:04.469
- Like, unhinged is the word.
- What makes you say that?

26:04.470 --> 26:08.070
Because they're freaking out.

26:13.700 --> 26:18.268
During my walk, there were too many dead
people outside to focus on specific faces.

26:18.269 --> 26:20.510
So I'm concentrating on the dead girl,

26:20.511 --> 26:25.228
who wants to scare the living
by hiding under their beds.

26:25.229 --> 26:29.009
There's one person in the bed.

26:29.071 --> 26:32.552
Kind of in the middle of it.

26:32.553 --> 26:35.914
It's the person under a cover?

26:35.915 --> 26:39.194
This kind of sheet of...

26:39.195 --> 26:41.409
Like, gray mist.

26:41.410 --> 26:45.631
Is coming out from under the
bed, going up alongside the bed.

26:45.632 --> 26:50.072
And then going over the top of the bed.

26:52.606 --> 26:55.726
Is this what you saw?

26:57.261 --> 26:59.121
Yes.

27:21.404 --> 27:25.338
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

27:25.339 --> 27:29.864
We're going to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.501
Mark, Diane, I want you
to meet my partner, Amy.

27:32.502 --> 27:35.270
They'd moved in here about
eight 1/2 years ago.

27:35.271 --> 27:39.019
They have a son, Zach, who
is confined to a wheelchair.

27:39.020 --> 27:42.021
And from the minute they moved in,
they've been experiencing things.

27:42.022 --> 27:45.314
But recently, it's gotten
a lot more active.

27:45.315 --> 27:49.357
Diane's health and even Zach's
health has been going downhill.

27:49.358 --> 27:52.944
And it's making their life
really hard for them here.

27:52.945 --> 27:55.837
They need to know if it's
safe to stay here or not.

27:55.838 --> 28:01.738
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she has some answers for you.

28:06.749 --> 28:10.418
Outside, there were all of these people.

28:10.419 --> 28:13.947
They were kind of coming
unhinged about something.

28:13.948 --> 28:16.695
Um, they were extremely poor.

28:16.696 --> 28:20.128
And I got that this was like 100 years ago.

28:20.129 --> 28:24.499
It's interesting. Very close to where
we are was a thing called a poor farm.

28:24.500 --> 28:28.395
And it ran from 1850 into the 1950s.

28:28.396 --> 28:33.710
And this poor farm housed the mentally
ill, the disabled, homeless...

28:33.711 --> 28:37.791
Anybody that didn't fit in society.

28:37.886 --> 28:40.729
Here's what it looked like.

28:40.730 --> 28:45.841
And this is literally less
than a mile from where we are.

28:45.842 --> 28:50.608
The odd thing is, if they died,
they buried them on the land.

28:50.609 --> 28:55.703
I've got a list here of 173
people that are documented...

28:55.704 --> 28:58.944
Buried on this property.

29:01.048 --> 29:02.411
Wow.

29:02.412 --> 29:07.032
They estimate there's at least another 300.

29:08.100 --> 29:11.835
Do you think the people that
we're talking about here,

29:11.836 --> 29:15.581
that they are the lost people out here?

29:15.582 --> 29:19.662
There were people who were acting...

29:19.748 --> 29:21.851
Bizarrely.

29:21.852 --> 29:25.692
So, yes, I believe that's them.

29:32.733 --> 29:34.799
So, what else did you see?

29:34.800 --> 29:39.000
I encountered a male who had an axe.

29:39.167 --> 29:42.527
And he had on suspenders.

29:42.534 --> 29:44.403
And a white shirt.

29:44.404 --> 29:47.686
But when I saw him in
here, he was in a suit.

29:47.687 --> 29:52.138
So, he seemed to be probably
a wealthier individual.

29:52.139 --> 29:55.223
The bad thing about him is
that he's absolutely crazy.

29:55.224 --> 29:57.434
I would say he's a sociopath.

29:57.435 --> 30:00.036
He looks at me, and he smiles.

30:00.037 --> 30:01.705
I didn't get a good feeling from him.

30:01.706 --> 30:03.544
He's angry.

30:03.545 --> 30:09.445
Not a good combination for some
dead person you want in your house.

30:09.946 --> 30:15.031
He's a very solid dead person, so
he knows how to manipulate energy,

30:15.032 --> 30:18.278
and he's able to manipulate
his surroundings.

30:18.279 --> 30:20.734
Why don't you tell her what
happened to you in the kitchen?

30:20.735 --> 30:24.586
I felt a definite shove on my hip.

30:24.587 --> 30:27.970
Like a push, like pushed out of the way.

30:27.971 --> 30:31.391
I was absolutely terrified.

30:32.982 --> 30:34.774
Wow.

30:34.775 --> 30:36.376
So, you said this guy was wealthy?

30:36.377 --> 30:38.064
Yes.

30:38.065 --> 30:42.566
Well, this house sits on what
was once a 350-acre farm.

30:42.567 --> 30:47.419
Owned by this guy William King,
who settled here in 1836.

30:47.420 --> 30:49.528
But the thing is, he
became wealthy from the

30:49.529 --> 30:52.692
land because this is
really good farmland here.

30:52.693 --> 30:55.212
- Now, you mentioned he was angry.
- Yes.

30:55.213 --> 30:59.074
Well, his wife Amelia died
at a very young age...

30:59.075 --> 31:03.515
- Oh, really?
- Of 29, giving childbirth.

31:03.560 --> 31:07.769
And he suffered some more tragedy.
He lost two sons.

31:07.770 --> 31:09.931
They died on the property.

31:09.932 --> 31:11.773
Does that make any sense to you?

31:11.774 --> 31:14.128
I did get two children in the house.

31:14.129 --> 31:16.874
One is a girl, and one's a boy.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.279
And they were not excited to see me because

31:20.280 --> 31:22.375
they knew that when I walked in the door,

31:22.376 --> 31:25.760
they were like, oh, you're
gonna get rid of us.

31:25.761 --> 31:28.704
I have sensed for years...

31:28.705 --> 31:31.818
That there is a child.

31:31.819 --> 31:34.579
Um, I could hear the little...

31:34.580 --> 31:36.038
- Footsteps.
- Mm-hmm.

31:36.039 --> 31:41.302
Come by me, next to me when I
was getting ready to go to bed.

31:41.303 --> 31:43.743
And Zach said kids were
playing with his trucks.

31:43.744 --> 31:45.973
He woke up. When he was real little.

31:45.974 --> 31:47.900
- Yeah.
- Two kids playing.

31:47.901 --> 31:51.049
He'd hear the wheels
squeaking on his truck.

31:51.050 --> 31:53.985
Yeah, the girl here is very active.

31:53.986 --> 31:57.944
She likes to hide under the beds.
This is her form of entertainment.

31:57.945 --> 32:03.765
She'll, like, want to crawl
up and get into bed with you.

32:04.379 --> 32:06.488
She's very touchy-feely.

32:06.489 --> 32:12.389
I do feel like there's something in our
bedroom when we're trying to sleep.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.050
Now, you mentioned touchy-feely.

32:15.051 --> 32:17.151
- Yes.
- She's been poked.

32:17.152 --> 32:21.193
It actually felt like it was something
that a kid would do to you.

32:21.194 --> 32:25.154
I felt a distinct tap on my leg.

32:25.723 --> 32:28.625
She's also had another
incident in the bedroom,

32:28.626 --> 32:33.006
which I want to show you a picture of.

32:33.631 --> 32:35.491
Wow.

32:35.566 --> 32:39.586
I felt... just a strange sensation.

32:39.796 --> 32:43.594
And I saw that, I about lost
my mind when I saw that.

32:43.595 --> 32:48.277
It frightens me because I was like, is
that evil, where did that come from?

32:48.278 --> 32:51.648
Let me ask you a question about getting
poked, do ya think that's this little girl?

32:51.649 --> 32:54.770
The poking, yeah. Definitely.

32:54.771 --> 32:57.656
But what about this?

32:57.657 --> 33:01.497
That actually could be your son.

33:02.871 --> 33:07.911
There's something called
spontaneous psychokinesis.

33:08.270 --> 33:13.560
Some people have a little bit
more energy than others.

33:13.561 --> 33:18.290
And occasionally, people can
influence their environment...

33:18.291 --> 33:19.819
Spontaneously.

33:19.820 --> 33:22.364
And it doesn't mean that
they're attacking anybody.

33:22.365 --> 33:26.037
It doesn't mean they're doing it on
purpose, it just means it's like...

33:26.038 --> 33:30.642
It's almost like a burst of
energy that just pops, okay?

33:30.643 --> 33:36.543
And so with any ability, you're going
to have experiences like this.

33:36.716 --> 33:38.717
And how old is your son?

33:38.718 --> 33:40.518
15.

33:40.887 --> 33:43.465
It can be hormonal.

33:43.466 --> 33:48.043
Usually, it's around children
who are, you know...

33:48.044 --> 33:50.264
Teenagers.

33:50.353 --> 33:54.193
Does Diane's son have abilities?

33:56.224 --> 33:58.351
Probably, yeah.

33:58.352 --> 34:01.232
Because Diane does.

34:02.089 --> 34:04.646
It's kind of strange, the
same night the scratches,

34:04.647 --> 34:06.644
we had to take Zach in the emergency room.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.717
He appeared to, like, have a seizure.

34:08.717 --> 34:12.022
If he's having seizures or something,
you know, around or following that,

34:12.023 --> 34:15.803
that could be a trigger signal.

34:17.018 --> 34:18.527
I've encountered this before.

34:18.527 --> 34:21.318
People who don't know they have
abilities can't control them,

34:21.319 --> 34:24.955
and sometimes their bodies can
react in unexplained ways.

34:24.956 --> 34:28.920
So, I did do a sketch of what I saw

34:28.922 --> 34:32.262
in The Master Bedroom with the girl.

34:32.263 --> 34:37.603
Okay. I don't get to see
Amy's sketches until now.

35:06.256 --> 35:09.807
I did do a sketch of what I saw,

35:09.808 --> 35:13.948
in The Master Bedroom with the girl.

35:26.772 --> 35:29.941
I see her, and she's crawling
around under the bed,

35:29.942 --> 35:35.842
but some people might see the mist
that's kind of emitted by her.

35:36.281 --> 35:39.941
That's usually where I sleep.

35:40.980 --> 35:43.170
What does she want?

35:43.171 --> 35:47.034
She's very bored and, like,
having fun, trying to have fun,

35:47.035 --> 35:50.995
and that's her fun, unfortunately.

35:51.904 --> 35:54.429
One night, I was trying to sleep.

35:54.430 --> 35:58.538
I heard a distinct whisper
right up against my ear.

35:58.539 --> 36:01.398
It was a female that said...

36:01.399 --> 36:06.235
"You have a little bit less
than two years to live".

36:06.236 --> 36:11.489
It was almost two years ago.
Now we're at that time.

36:11.490 --> 36:14.250
Am I the target?

36:14.499 --> 36:18.459
I think everyone in the house is.

36:26.701 --> 36:30.781
So, did you encounter anything else?

36:31.301 --> 36:37.201
Down here in the basement, I
actually witnessed a huge fistfight.

36:37.407 --> 36:39.629
There was a male named George.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.634
He was in his 20s.

36:41.635 --> 36:44.487
Apparently, he had inherited land,

36:44.488 --> 36:47.272
and him and this other dead
guy were in a fistfight.

36:47.273 --> 36:51.409
Because the other guy wanted
to take this land from...

36:51.410 --> 36:54.170
This kid, George.

36:54.453 --> 36:58.999
And then I see the young guy
George in a small house.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.155
And then I heard a gunshot.

37:01.156 --> 37:04.128
And I think George...

37:04.129 --> 37:06.469
Was killed.

37:07.895 --> 37:10.375
I got to tell you something
this is the most amazing,

37:10.376 --> 37:13.399
thing I've heard as far
as, like, nailing it.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.569
William King, who settled
here, had a son named George.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.159
Oh.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.805
Now, William died pretty young.

37:20.806 --> 37:26.706
And George was the oldest available son
that should've been taking over the farm.

37:26.950 --> 37:28.807
But he didn't get it.

37:28.808 --> 37:31.205
It went, actually, to his younger brother.

37:31.206 --> 37:34.846
I can only assume that
he had to feel slighted.

37:34.847 --> 37:39.455
And been pissed off that
he didn't get property.

37:39.456 --> 37:42.851
But he was a drunk in town,
always partying and,

37:42.852 --> 37:46.338
because he was such an irresponsible
24-year-old for the time,

37:46.339 --> 37:48.416
they didn't want to give it to him.

37:48.417 --> 37:51.965
Now, George came here to
the farm, to the house.

37:51.966 --> 37:54.133
He went inside to lie down.

37:54.134 --> 37:56.637
He took his pistol that he carried...

37:56.638 --> 38:01.609
A four-shot pistol... took it from his
pocket, and transferred it into his vest.

38:01.610 --> 38:05.450
And he accidentally shot himself.

38:12.170 --> 38:18.043
The next thing that I ran into
was this weird, little, like...

38:18.044 --> 38:21.584
I kept calling it the doll.

38:22.083 --> 38:26.073
It's all dark. It's,
like, made of darkness.

38:26.074 --> 38:30.678
It's somehow attached to
the guy with the axe.

38:30.679 --> 38:34.085
It's a part of him. It's
very, very negative.

38:34.086 --> 38:39.240
I was trying to connect with
it, and I saw it, and then...

38:39.241 --> 38:43.141
It ran into the wall over there.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.506
That is amazing.

38:47.507 --> 38:49.427
What?

38:49.657 --> 38:54.060
I kept seeing something out of the
corner of my eye from the laundry area.

38:54.061 --> 38:59.461
It shoots straight out of,
like, the wall over there.

39:01.736 --> 39:04.721
It was a solid, black
mass, but it was small.

39:04.722 --> 39:07.938
- It was like 3 feet tall maybe.
- Yeah.

39:07.939 --> 39:13.264
It's this little thing that the axe
man created that can do his bidding.

39:13.265 --> 39:17.243
If he wants to do something,
he would work through it.

39:17.244 --> 39:21.131
So, it's here all the time, but he's not.
See, he comes and goes.

39:21.132 --> 39:25.771
His thing is to make people nuts
like him, because he's crazy.

39:25.772 --> 39:31.033
And so he would want to, like,
torture and drive you nuts.

39:31.034 --> 39:32.613
And that's no way to live.

39:32.614 --> 39:36.286
No, we don't need some creepy guy or...

39:36.287 --> 39:39.197
Weird thing in the basement.

39:39.198 --> 39:41.852
I'd like to be able to be
free of these things so

39:41.853 --> 39:45.568
that I can focus on being
as good a mother as I can.

39:45.569 --> 39:48.740
It doesn't help that this is going on.

39:48.741 --> 39:51.561
- Yeah.
- Mm hmm.

39:52.911 --> 39:56.699
We want to be a normal
family as much as possible

39:56.700 --> 40:02.123
because we're under unusual circumstances
anyway with having a high-needs child.

40:02.124 --> 40:05.252
And I worry about him because
he's confined to that chair.

40:05.253 --> 40:09.393
- Mm mm.
- And completely vulnerable.

40:14.179 --> 40:18.217
Obviously, you've got a lot of
serious things going on here.

40:18.218 --> 40:22.694
But the pressing question is,
is it safe for you to be here?

40:22.695 --> 40:28.595
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she has some answers for you.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.794
You have a lot of dead
around this location,

40:32.795 --> 40:36.817
but the one who's really a problem
at this point is the little girl,

40:36.818 --> 40:39.573
because she's, like, a
fully conscious entity.

40:39.574 --> 40:42.831
You need to have a medium come in,

40:42.832 --> 40:46.334
and she's gonna have to get
this little girl out of here.

40:46.335 --> 40:51.206
When the medium comes through, she'll
also do a cleansing around the property.

40:51.207 --> 40:54.327
To set up a boundary.

40:54.582 --> 40:58.242
Against the man with the axe.

40:58.348 --> 41:03.019
And other various dead who
might wander through.

41:03.020 --> 41:06.996
The little thing down here, which
is attached to the axe man,

41:06.997 --> 41:11.129
keeping him out is going to
cause that link to dissipate.

41:11.130 --> 41:14.340
And so it'll probably
make him just go... ffft!

41:14.341 --> 41:16.501
No more.

41:16.646 --> 41:18.441
So, once they're able to,

41:18.442 --> 41:21.192
establish where there's no more
dead around here or in the house,

41:21.193 --> 41:23.559
will she start to feel better?

41:23.560 --> 41:25.720
Oh, yes.

41:26.062 --> 41:28.818
My question to you now is, are
you gonna follow Amy's advice?

41:28.819 --> 41:30.266
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

41:30.267 --> 41:35.667
I don't have to live in
complete fear all the time.

41:35.939 --> 41:38.922
I understand why Diane fears
for her son's well-being.

41:38.923 --> 41:41.792
Encountering that many
entities can be terrifying,

41:41.793 --> 41:44.260
but I'm confident that if
she follows my advice,

41:44.261 --> 41:47.976
she and her family should lead
a happy and peaceful life.
