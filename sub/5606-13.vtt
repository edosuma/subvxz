Well, North Shore in January.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.815
Nothing comes close.

03:19.816 --> 03:21.432
Yeah, but today
was especially good.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.369
Off-shore winds,
perfect overheads--

03:24.371 --> 03:25.637
it doesn't get
much better.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.206
Yeah, I'd say it could get
a little bit better.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.207
What are you talking about?

03:28.209 --> 03:29.474
You were smiling out there.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.576
STEVE:
Nah, he wasn't.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.843
That was more like
an anemic grin.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.445
DANNY: Ha-ha.
(chuckles)

03:33.447 --> 03:35.414
Well, let me explain
that, uh, "anemic grin."

03:35.416 --> 03:37.683
That is because you, my friend,
are a wave hog.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.952
Excuse me? I'm a wave hog?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.887
That's right. Wave hog.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.522
The man has a point.
DANNY:  Thank you.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.074
Yeah, you weren't, um,

03:45.075 --> 03:46.625
the most patient in
the lineup out there, boss.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.660
See? You're a wave hog. Okay, fine.
All right? No, I'm fine.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.813
Let's talk about this.
You want the truth?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.965
You want to know why I was
doing the party wave thing?

03:52.967 --> 03:54.533
It was for
his benefit,

03:54.535 --> 03:56.668
in case he got into trouble.
Oh. I see. I see.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.903
So you-you being
a pig out there,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.271
stealing everybody's waves,

03:59.273 --> 04:00.505
that's, uh,
that's for my benefit?

04:00.507 --> 04:02.274
Yeah, it was so you
didn't drown, okay?

04:02.276 --> 04:03.842
Listen to me.
You want me on that wave.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.311
You need me on that wave.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.546
I see what you're doing there.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.947
That's, uh...
he's doing Jack Nicholson.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.816
He is.  It's good. And
it's very appropriate,

04:10.818 --> 04:12.384
too, because the last
six years of my life

04:12.385 --> 04:13.951
have sort of been like<i> The</i>
<i> Shining,</i> which is a film that,

04:13.954 --> 04:15.921
if you'd seen, you would
know that Jack Nicholson

04:15.923 --> 04:17.422
spends the whole movie

04:17.424 --> 04:19.424
torturing a young boy
named Danny.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.143
Like you're torturing me now?

04:21.144 --> 04:22.861
Gentlemen, as much as
I'm enjoying this--

04:22.863 --> 04:24.529
and I am enjoying this--

04:24.531 --> 04:26.765
we should probably get going
before traffic gets bad.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.400
You're absolutely right.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.435
Wave hog.
Party wave.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.937
Whoa.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.038
What's up?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.673
Traffic's jacked already.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.041
Kamehameha's like a parking lot

04:36.043 --> 04:38.410
from Wahiawa
all the way through Pearl City.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.811
We gotta take the 83.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.046
No, I don't want
to take the 83.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.481
Drive all the way
around the whole island?

04:42.483 --> 04:43.849
It's a nightmare.
Okay, we...

04:43.851 --> 04:45.317
It's another... it's another
half an hour driving

04:45.319 --> 04:46.718
or another hour
sitting in traffic.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.020
What do you want? Yeah,
at least it's more scenic.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.421
Yeah.
I got a shortcut.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.706
All right, I'll
take the shortcut

04:50.707 --> 04:51.990
if it gets me out of
the car with him earlier.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.992
We cut through
the coffee fields in Waialua.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.994
Wait a minute,
the service roads?

04:55.996 --> 04:57.663
Mm-hmm.
What, are you crazy?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.398
One wrong turn up there,
we'll be back here.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.033
It'll be midnight
by the time we get home.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.068
No, it's...
it's a maze up there.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.436
Well, maybe for a<i> haole.</i>

05:04.438 --> 05:05.704
But I used to
ride those trails

05:05.706 --> 05:07.339
on my dirt bike,
when I was a kid.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.308
Oh...  Oh! Hey, we're
gonna be back home

05:09.310 --> 05:10.575
before you guys
even reach Turtle Bay.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.843
Cuz, I think you
just threw down.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.012
Oh, oh, yeah, he threw down.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.414
You care to make
this interesting,

05:15.416 --> 05:16.615
my friend?

05:16.617 --> 05:18.850
What did you have in mind?
Little wager.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.319
Sure.
Good.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.705
First car to the Palace wins.

05:22.706 --> 05:25.090
The losers pay for dinner
and drinks at Side Street.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.625
How 'bout that?

05:26.627 --> 05:27.859
I like it. We're in.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.961
Whoa, hey, hey.
Cool your jets, Turbo.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.630
There's some rules
in this game, okay?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.098
Okay.
First one: no speeding.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.833
Okay.
Good.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.335
Second one: no sirens.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.569
Okay.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.570
Next rule: no HPD escort.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.938
He's gonna break
all these rules.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.373
(laughs)

05:41.375 --> 05:42.908
Hey. Right here.
Okay.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.443
You got it?
Mm-hmm.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.844
Okay, fine.
We all good?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.412
On your mark, set, go!

05:47.414 --> 05:49.014
See, he's cheating already.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.687
He Bo & Luke'd that.
Sweet.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.922
Let's go.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.930
Wake up.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.937
Hell you doing, Lou?

06:11.939 --> 06:14.005
Ugh...

06:15.442 --> 06:16.842
I need to go to the ER.

06:16.844 --> 06:17.909
Shut up.
You all right.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.613
Giordano's?

06:21.615 --> 06:23.148
Must be Thursday night.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.086
Whatever the hell
you're doing, Lou, forget it.

Death...

06:48.041 --> 06:49.908
taxes...

I would've shared
my pizza with you, Lou.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.984
You didn't have to go through
all this trouble, man.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.153
No trouble at all.
Matter of fact,

07:01.155 --> 07:03.655
we can end this thing right now.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.858
All you gotta do

07:06.860 --> 07:08.794
is tell me
you murdered your wife.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.198
Now, you know that's
not gonna happen.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.000
Well, I got some
bad news for you, brother.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.202

09:52.793 --> 09:54.859
Everyone we work with.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.063
(groans)
(laughs)

09:58.065 --> 09:59.030
It's that obvious?

09:59.032 --> 10:00.999
Yes! It's very, very obvious.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.201
(laughs)
It's ridiculous.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.870
All right, all right,
all right.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.872
Not to be a bummer,

10:07.874 --> 10:10.008
but what happens when she goes
back to San Francisco?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.643
Uh, yeah.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.345
I'm trying really hard not
to think about that right now.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.046
Mm.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.181
Yeah.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.086
Okay. Okay.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.021
So now we gotta get
the variable to one side.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.191
And remember, whatever we do
on one side, we what?

10:26.193 --> 10:28.093
That's right, that's right.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.194
We do on the other.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.962
So we subtract.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.731
Now...

10:32.733 --> 10:36.768
you should have 16 = 4k.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.771
Therefore, "K" is what?

10:42.042 --> 10:43.241
That's my boy.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.176
What'd I tell you?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.645
What'd I tell you?

good with numbers,

10:50.250 --> 10:52.984

You know that?

11:25.352 --> 11:28.353
This is seriously
messed up.

Yeah, so's stepping out
on your wife of 20 years

11:32.225 --> 11:35.060

to let this go, hmm?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.303
How am I supposed to let go

11:45.305 --> 11:47.272
of seeing my friend
go in the ground?

2304 Kirkland Avenue.

Yeah, well, we raided
a lot of stash houses back then.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.212
Oh, not like
this one.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.482
See, this one, you was
primary through the door.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.484
And the perp drew a weapon,
I don't remember what it was.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.486
A nine or FN-5-something.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.954

what did you find?

15:33.099 --> 15:36.267
You found two bags...

15:36.269 --> 15:39.971
each with upwards
of $250,000 in cash.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.611

15:46.613 --> 15:48.613

Then you'll be wanting to
hear the rest of the story.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.018
'Cause if you remember...

15:56.256 --> 15:59.524
...all the serial numbers
on those bills were sequential.

15:59.526 --> 16:03.394
Well, I'm sorry,
almost all of them.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.664
That is, until the money
got turned into evidence,

16:06.666 --> 16:10.401
where they discovered
a huge gap in the numbers.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.770
You remember?

16:12.771 --> 16:15.138
Everybody started talking
about how there had to be

16:15.141 --> 16:18.543
at least a bagful of
that cash that went missing.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.012
How could that be?

16:21.014 --> 16:23.281
And nobody ever found it.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.283
But you know what?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.685
I think I know exactly
what happened to that money.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.555
So what are you thinking,
I found the bags

16:30.557 --> 16:35.293
and squirreled one away
before you got there?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.095
Well, if you think
that's the case,

16:37.097 --> 16:38.730
why the hell didn't you
turn me in?!

16:38.732 --> 16:41.566
Because you were
my partner, that's why!

16:41.568 --> 16:44.702
I trusted you!

16:44.704 --> 16:46.037
I'd have believed any story,

16:46.039 --> 16:47.472
other than that one,
to be the truth.

16:50.310 --> 16:54.312
You murdered your wife.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.115
Now I see everything different.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.587
So now I'm a murderer
<i> and</i> a thief.

17:02.589 --> 17:06.057
Well, we both know
you're a murderer.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.159
But a thief?

17:08.161 --> 17:10.428
Yeah, you're a pretty
exceptional thief.

17:10.430 --> 17:14.065
Maybe the best I've seen
in 25 years wearing the badge.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.600
Yeah, well, if I'm that good,

17:15.602 --> 17:17.802
why am I still living
in Hyde Park? Why?

17:17.804 --> 17:21.706
Because you're smart,
that's why.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.443
You move to the Gold Coast,
that's gonna look suspicious.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.179
So you stay here.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.181
Living with this horrible art
in this neighborhood,

17:30.183 --> 17:32.183
the same neighborhood
where everybody sees you,

17:32.185 --> 17:34.719
everybody knows you,
and as far as they're concerned,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.187
you're still the same
neighborhood guy,

17:36.189 --> 17:38.556

old stand-up Clay.

imagination, Lou.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.560

I put this mythical money?

17:46.566 --> 17:47.732

17:47.734 --> 17:50.201
You're too slick for that.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.204
You're too careful for that.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.740
No, I think you've
got that paper

17:55.742 --> 17:58.109
hidden right here
in this house.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.311
More to the point...

18:03.416 --> 18:07.485
...I think they're right up
in some of these walls.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.389
You remember that
do-it-yourself project

18:11.391 --> 18:13.124
that I came over
to help you with,

18:13.126 --> 18:15.393
when you put up the new
drywall in your basement?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.395
And then you got
the bright idea

18:17.397 --> 18:19.397
to hide some
of your poker winnings

18:19.399 --> 18:20.698
behind that drywall.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.700
You even had a stupid
little name for it.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.168
"Yeah, man, this is my...

18:24.170 --> 18:27.638
my 'break drywall

18:27.640 --> 18:29.707

18:33.246 --> 18:35.780

18:35.782 --> 18:38.116
I ain't gonna need
any confession.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.518
That money's gonna
lock you up.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.786
And I'm gonna
find that money

18:41.788 --> 18:44.422

every wall in this house,

18:44.424 --> 18:45.756

19:02.709 --> 19:05.176

I have no signal.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.194

19:48.588 --> 19:50.221
Well, they can't be far,

already checked there.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.547

20:49.549 --> 20:51.916

'em to me, or I can just take 'em.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.451

20:56.723 --> 20:58.723
Yeah.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.860

21:02.862 --> 21:04.729

21:14.274 --> 21:15.306
JEREMY:
Let's go.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.308
Get in, it's
your time to dig.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.943
Get in!

21:18.945 --> 21:21.479
Grab a shovel.
You too.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.558
You're wasting your time, Lou.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.893
Even if I did
take that cash,

21:35.895 --> 21:38.696
you think I'd be dumb enough
to hide it in my house?

21:41.901 --> 21:43.367
Yeah.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.969
Yeah, that's exactly
what I think.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.639
Breaking and entering.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.908
Assault, kidnapping.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.577
You know you're gonna
go to jail for this.

21:53.579 --> 21:54.845
Yeah, well, it'll be me and you.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.714
I got dibs on the bottom bunk.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.516
You think this is funny?

21:58.518 --> 22:01.052
I wish it was.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.487
Oh, well.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.857
Back to work.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.994
(car approaching)

22:19.706 --> 22:20.771
(gun cocks)

22:32.352 --> 22:34.418
You lying son of a bitch.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.619
It's Leann.

22:35.621 --> 22:38.089
I thought you said
she was out of town.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.791
All right, smart guy.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.965
(groans)

22:49.435 --> 22:50.968
(panting)

22:55.108 --> 22:57.141
You better listen to me
very carefully.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.643
<i> If you give a damn</i>
<i> about that woman...</i>

23:01.114 --> 23:03.147
<i> ...you're gonna want to do</i>

23:03.149 --> 23:05.950
<i> everything I tell you to do.</i>

23:05.952 --> 23:07.151
Or what?

23:07.153 --> 23:08.719
You gonna kill us?

23:14.694 --> 23:15.926
LEANN:
Clay?

23:18.131 --> 23:19.830
(quietly):
You keep saying

23:19.832 --> 23:21.532
that I'm crazy.

23:22.668 --> 23:25.436
See, that's the thing
about crazy people--

23:25.438 --> 23:26.804
they don't know they're crazy.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.807
See, I left my wife
and my kids

23:29.809 --> 23:31.909
on an island in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean

23:31.911 --> 23:34.612
to fly on a plane for nine
and a half hours in coach

23:34.614 --> 23:35.780
to get a confession from a guy

23:35.782 --> 23:37.748
who I know is
never gonna confess to me.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.751
And now...
(gun cocks)

23:40.753 --> 23:43.154
now I got a gun
to your throat.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.491
I don't know if I'm crazy,

23:47.493 --> 23:49.493
but if you don't give me

23:49.495 --> 23:51.695
what I want...

23:51.697 --> 23:54.932
I swear I'm gonna burn
this place to the ground

23:54.934 --> 23:57.468
with both
of your dead asses in it.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.538
Clay, you home?

24:05.778 --> 24:06.777
(phone rings)

24:06.779 --> 24:08.846
(chuckles)

24:09.782 --> 24:10.915
I'm here.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.016
Where are you?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.884
Hey, babe.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.886
I had to run an errand.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.488
I'm sorry,
I should've told you.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.856
I saw your car outside.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.658
Figured you were here.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.593
Well, the block heater broke.

24:22.595 --> 24:23.794
She wouldn't start,
so I took a taxi.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.497
(mouthing)

24:26.499 --> 24:28.199
Why don't you meet me
at Finn's for a drink?

24:28.201 --> 24:29.633
If you get there before me,

24:29.635 --> 24:31.235
just order me the usual.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.837
(giggles)

24:32.839 --> 24:34.038
Okay.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.539
I'll see you there.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.074
All right, I love you.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.009
Oh, love you, too.

24:45.751 --> 24:46.817
(phone clunks)

24:55.194 --> 24:57.194
Hello?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.832
Hear that?

25:01.834 --> 25:03.067
Hear what?

25:03.069 --> 25:04.969
Silence.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.804
Silence is the sound
of victory, my friend.

25:06.806 --> 25:07.905
Chin and Kono are not here.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.974
We beat them, which means...

25:09.976 --> 25:11.976
winner, winner,
Side Street dinner!

25:11.978 --> 25:13.043
You're such an idiot.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.144
You're pathetic.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.713
I'm pathetic?
You peed in a bottle.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.681
Please don't tell anybody
about that.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.333
Where you going?

25:19.334 --> 25:20.984
I'm gonna go get the bottle--
I left it in the car.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.086
Okay, that's disgusting.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.021
(sighs)

25:24.023 --> 25:25.923
(inhales)

25:25.925 --> 25:27.658
(sighs)

25:33.599 --> 25:34.732
(sighs)

25:34.734 --> 25:36.667
I need one of you
to come with me.

25:38.604 --> 25:39.670
I'll go.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.274
But you got to promise me
nothing happens to her.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.142
You do as I say,
and nothing will.

25:48.714 --> 25:49.713
Where are we going?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.181
Just move.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.992
Move.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.262
All right, all right.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.964
To the trunk.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.771
(alarm chirps)

26:17.777 --> 26:18.776
Who is he?

26:18.778 --> 26:19.944
Doesn't matter.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.845
Well,

26:21.847 --> 26:23.981
he's not just gonna climb
out of there himself.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.849
Let's go.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.622
(groaning)

26:37.196 --> 26:38.696
He's a cop.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.964
He's what happens
when you put your nose

26:39.966 --> 26:41.699
in other people's business.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.601
Now move.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.175
Your brother's not gonna
make it-- you know that.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.077
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:53.079 --> 26:54.645
Prison.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.714
I know a guy who went in
for manslaughter.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.216
Within six months, they found
him hanging in his cell.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.952
You know, you, you'll be fine.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.621
But your brother...

27:03.623 --> 27:05.189
he's not you.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.725
Well, I guess were gonna have
to not get caught then.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.794
How long you think you'll
be able to keep a secret?

27:10.796 --> 27:12.229
I think you better shut up.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.330
Just trying to help.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.832
(grunting)

27:20.806 --> 27:21.939
(grunts)

27:47.900 --> 27:49.900
That's far enough, cop.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.368
Drop it.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.436
Drop it!

27:52.438 --> 27:55.706
Or the next one won't miss.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.212
What's up?

28:03.783 --> 28:05.049
You hear from Chin or Kono yet?

28:05.051 --> 28:07.251
No. Why?

28:07.253 --> 28:08.318
Well, 'cause they're not
answering their phones,

28:08.320 --> 28:09.319
and they should've been here
by now.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.754
(sighs)

28:10.756 --> 28:12.756
Maybe they, uh, got car trouble.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.125
Yeah, but...

28:15.127 --> 28:17.027
why wouldn't they
answer their phones?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.862
Well, that's what I mean.
You know, you warned 'em

28:18.864 --> 28:19.863
about those service roads.

28:19.865 --> 28:20.864
Maybe they got car trouble

28:20.866 --> 28:22.733
and they got no signal up there.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.068
Yeah.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.836
Well, if you're worried
about it, we'll go up there.

28:25.838 --> 28:26.837
We'll drive back up
to North Shore

28:26.839 --> 28:29.006
and find them.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.274
You know what, let's do that.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.341
All right.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.116
Drop him right there.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.986
Hey, dig.

28:45.458 --> 28:46.757
Everything all right?

28:46.759 --> 28:48.125
No, everything's not all right.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.126
They're cops.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.161
What? Wait, he told you?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.329
He said squat. They got
an undercover car

28:52.331 --> 28:53.330
back there.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.798
What are we gonna do?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.133
Just relax.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.301
CHIN: Listen,

28:57.303 --> 28:59.870
it's not too late
to change your mind.

28:59.872 --> 29:00.904
You saw my car.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.172
The keys are in it.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.907
There's no way
we'll be able to follow you.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.110
I don't want you to talk.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.444
I want you to dig.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.047
Now.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.116
And make sure
there's room enough for three.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.919
(engine revving)

29:17.423 --> 29:19.022
This is, this is ridiculous.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.324
They could've taken
any one of these roads.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.493
Yeah, then we take them all
until we find them.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.022
♪ ♪

29:57.062 --> 29:58.929
(sighs)

30:25.191 --> 30:26.990
♪ ♪

30:31.263 --> 30:32.896
(sighs)

30:35.034 --> 30:36.233
(scoffs)

30:36.235 --> 30:38.502
Boy, you got to be
a real dumb ass,

30:38.504 --> 30:41.405
using your badge number
for your safe combination.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.841
Yeah, well, at least I
didn't use my birthday.

30:43.843 --> 30:46.076
Yeah, I tried that first.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.546
Remember these?

30:49.548 --> 30:51.014
Your wife's rings?

30:51.016 --> 30:52.182
What's the matter,

30:52.184 --> 30:54.218
you didn't have time
to go pawn them yet?

30:54.220 --> 30:55.619
How many times
I got to tell you?

30:55.621 --> 30:57.621
You're not gonna find
what you're looking for, Lou.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.456
It doesn't exist, never has.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.425
It's here.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.293
It's here and I know it.
I feel it

31:03.295 --> 31:04.862
in my gut,
just like I felt it

31:04.864 --> 31:06.597
when I knew that
you murdered your wife.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.433
And I'm gonna find
that money,

31:09.435 --> 31:10.901
and when I find it,

31:10.903 --> 31:12.536
I'm coming up here,

31:12.537 --> 31:14.170
and I'm lighting
a big, fat, Cuban cigar

31:14.173 --> 31:16.173
and smoke it with a smile
on my face,

31:16.175 --> 31:19.176
and then I'm going right down
to Cook County Criminal Court,

31:19.178 --> 31:22.012
and watch them perp walk
your black ass

31:22.014 --> 31:23.947
right up them steps!

31:23.949 --> 31:26.183
So you hold onto that,
partner.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.554
Defense lawyers
don't come cheap.

31:30.556 --> 31:33.991
There's no getting
through to you, is there?

31:33.993 --> 31:36.526
No penetrating that
thick skull of yours.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.595
Man, after all this time,
you still don't have

31:38.597 --> 31:40.330
one shred of proof
that I killed Diane.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.332
Doesn't that
tell you anything?

31:42.334 --> 31:44.167
Please! You had a woman
on the side!

31:45.604 --> 31:46.937
You're sleeping
with this girl,

31:46.939 --> 31:48.071
and telling her you're gonna

31:48.073 --> 31:49.239
leave your wife for her.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.341
And now your wife's dead!

31:51.343 --> 31:52.676
And now you're with her!

31:52.678 --> 31:54.678
So that tells me something.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.949
Been over that.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.450
What I told Leann was...

32:00.452 --> 32:02.185
Pillow talk, yeah.
...pillow talk, right.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.553
I was never gonna leave Diane.

32:03.555 --> 32:04.688
Yeah, not the easy way.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.525
Let me ask you something,
partner.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.329
If I was thinking about bailing
on my marriage,

32:12.331 --> 32:14.398
don't you think I would've
called my best friend first?

32:14.400 --> 32:15.599
Talked to him about it?

32:17.937 --> 32:18.969
Anything big,

32:18.971 --> 32:20.304
anything important,

32:20.306 --> 32:21.505
we told each other.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.240
Like Philly, for example.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.354
What'd you say?

32:26.355 --> 32:27.432
Anybody ever say anything
about what happened there?

32:27.433 --> 32:28.510
Say something else
about Philly.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.213
Say something else about Philly,

32:30.215 --> 32:32.082
I swear, I'll knock out
all your fronts.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.184
Don't you ever
bring that up again.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.652
Oops.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.689
Struck a nerve
while I was making a point.

32:38.691 --> 32:41.124
Huh?

32:41.126 --> 32:43.961
Because we shared
things in confidence.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.729
We were each other's priests!

32:47.066 --> 32:49.132
If I was gonna leave my wife,

32:49.134 --> 32:50.567
you would've been
the first to know.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.469
Yeah.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.540
Would I be the first to know

32:56.542 --> 32:59.376
that you planned
on pushing her off a cliff?

32:59.378 --> 33:01.511
(grunts)

33:01.513 --> 33:04.514
You have an answer for
everything, don't you?

33:04.516 --> 33:06.249
Are you done?

33:06.251 --> 33:08.518
No, go ahead.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.253
Swing your hammer.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.122
Take this place
down to the studs.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.657
Rip up the
floorboards.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.660
Hell, you can burn it down
to the ground for all I care,

33:16.662 --> 33:18.161
because after all this,

33:18.163 --> 33:19.696
nobody's ever gonna believe

33:19.698 --> 33:21.565
that you might've been
right about Diane.

Run!

33:29.874 --> 33:31.173
Hey! Come here!
LeAnn, get out of here!

33:31.176 --> 33:32.576
Run!

33:32.578 --> 33:33.577
Hey! Come here!
Help! Help!

33:33.579 --> 33:35.012
Let her go, Lou!
Clay!

33:35.014 --> 33:36.163
GROVER: I got her! I got her!
Leave her alone!

33:36.164 --> 33:37.313
Let her go!  I got her!
LEANN: Clay, help me!

33:37.316 --> 33:38.715
Shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.161
We are gonna find them.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.030
Yeah.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.348
What "yeah"?

33:54.349 --> 33:55.665
That's twice now
that you've said that.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.534
What?

33:57.536 --> 34:00.771
"Yeah. Yeah."

34:00.773 --> 34:03.306
Oh, that's you pretending to
be me, is that what that is?

34:03.308 --> 34:05.042
Yeah, that's-that's
you doing me, all right?

34:05.044 --> 34:06.610
Doom and gloom does not
suit you, all right?

34:06.612 --> 34:08.145
Look, I-I can't help it.

34:08.146 --> 34:09.679
At the moment, I can't...
I can't stop thinking

34:09.681 --> 34:11.581
that maybe this has got
something to do with Gabriel.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.582
Would you stop?

34:12.584 --> 34:13.950
Just stop.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.317
They're probably sitting
on the side of the road

34:15.320 --> 34:17.054
with their car,
uh, broken down,

34:17.056 --> 34:18.588
they can't use their phone,
no cell service, all right?

34:18.590 --> 34:20.323
I understand that your
instincts are telling you

34:20.325 --> 34:22.059
that things are terrible--
because that's who you are--

34:22.061 --> 34:23.060
but let's be positive.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.261
That's all, positive.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.529
(engine roaring)

34:25.531 --> 34:27.631
Leave her alone, Lou.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.232
I'm sorry I have
to do this to you.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.600
What do you want from us?

34:30.602 --> 34:32.736
CLAY: He still thinks
I killed Diane.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.571
I told you, he's obsessed.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.175
Aah! You're hurting me.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.709
You should have
stayed at the bar.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.478
You were fine at the bar.

34:41.479 --> 34:43.246
I didn't want to get you
involved in this.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.082
CLAY: Just do as
he says, LeAnn.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.083
All right?

34:46.085 --> 34:47.617
He's digging his own grave.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.853
One count of kidnapping's
not good enough for him.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.621
He wants to double-down,
so let him.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.491
LEANN:
Listen to me.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.293
You're wrong about Clay.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.127
You gotta let this go.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.167
Please, leave us alone.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.236
Clay did nothing wrong.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.407
LeAnn...

35:13.178 --> 35:16.179
I got a wife.

35:16.181 --> 35:19.449
I got a beautiful wife
and two beautiful kids.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.451
I got a lot of friends.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.386
I got a big fat pension.

35:23.388 --> 35:26.123
I even have
an honorary membership

35:26.125 --> 35:27.524
at the Waialae
Country Club.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.259
I'm really blessed.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.795
And you think, with all that,

35:31.797 --> 35:35.532
do you think I'd just
throw that into the garbage...

35:35.534 --> 35:39.536
if I had even
a scintilla of doubt

35:39.538 --> 35:41.338
about what he did?

35:41.340 --> 35:43.874
Hmm?

35:43.876 --> 35:44.875
He didn't...

35:44.877 --> 35:46.676
You know he did it.

35:50.149 --> 35:53.150
He killed his wife.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.385
On their anniversary.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.421
He pushed her off a cliff

35:58.423 --> 36:01.558
and watched her head
crack open on some rocks

36:01.560 --> 36:03.260
for you.

36:07.199 --> 36:10.467
What are you gonna do
when his game just rewinds?

36:10.469 --> 36:14.738
What are you gonna do when
he finds the next LeAnn?

36:14.740 --> 36:18.241
Will he do the same
thing to you?

36:23.582 --> 36:25.849
I'm gonna leave
you two now.

36:25.851 --> 36:29.252
You look like you could use
a little alone time.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.591
Don't let him get
in your head.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.593
You know me, baby.

36:36.595 --> 36:39.863
You know I would never
do anything like that.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.932
Right?

36:48.240 --> 36:49.506
All right,
you're done.

36:49.508 --> 36:50.774
Drop the shovels
and get out.
