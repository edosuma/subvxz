03:20.950 --> 03:25.454
(Italian-accented man)
My father was a very big man.

03:25.538 --> 03:30.042
All his life he wore a black moustache.

03:30.126 --> 03:35.005
When it turned grey
he used a little brush to keep it black,

03:35.089 --> 03:39.676
such as ladies use
for their eyes - mascara.

03:39.761 --> 03:45.641
Everyone was afraid of him.
My mother, my four sisters.

03:45.725 --> 03:52.189
At the dining table you could not speak
unless spoken to first by my father.

03:52.273 --> 03:56.568
But he loved me.
I was his favourite.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.789
(woman) I want to call England.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.874
Yes, I want to call England.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.712
No, it's not London.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.881
It's not London.

05:01.592 --> 05:05.554
It's in Sussex. Hastings in Sussex.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.390
You know the code.
You got it for me yesterday.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.851
Well, someone did, yes.

05:10.935 --> 05:15.605
Quattro cinque otto due sei uno.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.774
Hastings, Sussex.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.737
Oh, God!

05:24.741 --> 05:28.035
Can't read this damn book. It's...

05:28.119 --> 05:30.203
It's unreadable.

05:31.331 --> 05:36.752
Can't even bind the bloody thing properly.
Come on, let's go out.

05:36.878 --> 05:42.382
- I'm trying to get through to the children.
- All right. Answer.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.218
Hello. Yes.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.014
Mother, hello!

05:49.098 --> 05:51.600
Yes, lovely.

05:53.144 --> 05:56.480
Yes, absolutely. How are they?

05:58.232 --> 06:00.192
Are they...?

06:00.276 --> 06:02.361
Yes, lovely.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.489
Hello, darling, it's Mummy.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.033
How are you?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.244
Is Cathy there?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.670
(rustling)

07:08.094 --> 07:10.178
Incredible, isn't it?

07:29.866 --> 07:33.535
I think the St Augustine is incredible.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.245
So...

07:36.914 --> 07:40.834
- I don't know.
- Mm. You thought that the last time.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.170
What do you mean?

07:43.254 --> 07:46.882
You thought that the last time
we were in Venice, remember?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.675
Did I?

07:48.759 --> 07:51.511
- Well, so what?
- Nothing, I'm just...

07:51.596 --> 07:55.390
What's the point of saying that?
Why did you say that?

07:55.433 --> 07:59.019
- I didn't mean it as an insult.
- Christ.

07:59.103 --> 08:02.105
- I'm making an observation.
- What observation?

08:02.190 --> 08:06.568
I'm simply pointing out
you haven't changed your mind.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.820
(camera shutter clicks)

08:09.822 --> 08:14.493
Anyway, I agree with you.
I think it's incredible too.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.235
Shit!

09:31.320 --> 09:33.738
What is it?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.490
Look.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.411
Got another pimple.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.873
Tsk! The girls won't love you any more.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.462
- I must need more salt or something.
- What?

09:49.547 --> 09:52.716
I must need to eat more salt or something.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.844
You don't need salt, you need sex.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.929
Hmph!

09:58.014 --> 10:01.141
- Could I have it with salt?
- Why not?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.893
(phone rings)

10:03.978 --> 10:07.522
God! Don't they know I'm trying to shave?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.823
Hello?

10:16.907 --> 10:20.660
Yes, he is. Hold on a minute.
It's Simon.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.002
What?

10:29.086 --> 10:35.300
I'm only halfway through the bloody thing.
It's unreadable anyway.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.845
This is supposed to be my holiday.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.605
- Those two. Thank you.
- Ventimila.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.653
Ecco una.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.821
This one's for Jack.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.785
- Ecco la seconda.
- And this is for Cathy. What do you think?

11:01.869 --> 11:03.870
They'll be thrilled.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.916
I'm going to do a little drawing of Cathy.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.627
With spots.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.464
And I'm going to do
a little drawing of Jack.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.633
(woman laughs)

11:18.010 --> 11:19.678
For Jack.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.388
Jacko.

11:21.889 --> 11:26.059
- What do you think?
- Fantastic. You're a genius.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.269
Grazie.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.278
Hold it.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.031
Oh, come on. Smile!

11:43.577 --> 11:46.830
- Would you take a photograph of us?
- Avec plaisir.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.998
Thank you.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.627
Tiens-moi ga.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.344
Voilà.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.513
Thank you.

12:19.196 --> 12:25.493
(man) My youngest sisters, Alice and
Lisa, came to me in the garden and said:

12:25.578 --> 12:29.122
"Robert, Robert,
come to the kitchen quickly."

12:29.206 --> 12:32.751
"Eva and Maria have a treat for you."

12:46.974 --> 12:50.018
(woman) Cathy's been selected
for the football team.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.856
- (man) What football team?
- The school football team. What else?

12:55.900 --> 12:59.652
- (woman) Don't you think it's dangerous?
- Not really.

12:59.737 --> 13:05.241
(woman) Tell me something.
Tell me the truth. Do you like children?

13:05.326 --> 13:08.036
- What children?
- My children.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.124
I like your children.

13:13.209 --> 13:18.004
No, what I mean is,
do you actually like children?

13:18.088 --> 13:24.010
- You mean all children?
- Children. Do you actually like children?

13:24.094 --> 13:27.472
You mean as such?
The species as such?

13:30.267 --> 13:32.769
What I mean is...

13:32.853 --> 13:37.065
The real truth is...
you don't like children.

13:39.485 --> 13:43.446
What you mean is,
you think I don't like your children.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.577
What about me?

13:51.622 --> 13:54.249
Do you like me?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.128
I like you.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.132
And you know why?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.884
NO,

14:04.969 --> 14:10.181
I like you because you're always
asking me such challenging questions.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.309
You're always testing my intellect.

14:42.214 --> 14:46.885
Did I ever tell you the terrible thing that
happened to me when I was a little girl?

14:46.969 --> 14:50.597
The worst thing
that ever happened to me?

14:50.681 --> 14:53.308
No, you didn't tell me.

14:53.392 --> 14:58.938
Well, I was about seven or eight and...

14:59.023 --> 15:05.904
there was this gang of kids,
boys and girls, and we were this gang.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.951
One day...

15:12.912 --> 15:18.166
some of them said "One member of this
gang isn't good enough to be a member."

15:18.250 --> 15:21.961
"Does everyone agree that
we should throw this person out?"

15:22.046 --> 15:26.299
And I said "Yes." I clapped.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.051
Clapped?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.802
Yes.

15:32.348 --> 15:38.478
I clapped. I said
"Yes, throw this person out."

15:39.939 --> 15:42.815
And you know who that person was?

15:45.694 --> 15:47.362
You.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.448
Yes.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.994
That's terrible.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.831
(both laugh) That's a terrible story.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.842
Up at dawn for you and into a speedboat.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.345
Where shall we go?
Where can we go?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.807
Murano. They blow beautiful glass.
Very nice.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.851
Murano! Lovely.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.312
- What time's dawn?
- Dawn, signore?

16:21.397 --> 16:25.900
Daybreak.
A speedboat to Murano at daybreak.

16:37.746 --> 16:42.250
And on the table were two big
bottles of lemonade, a cream cake,

16:42.334 --> 16:47.046
two packets of cooking chocolate,
a big box of marshmallows.

16:47.131 --> 16:51.592
And Maria said
"Look, darling. This is all for you."

17:25.335 --> 17:27.211
(woman) Colin?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.969
Find anything?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.809
Isn't this beautiful?

17:48.275 --> 17:50.359
What do you think?

18:10.047 --> 18:15.301
And Maria said "Look, darling.
This is all for you."

18:51.547 --> 18:53.005
(woman groans)

18:53.090 --> 18:55.049
Are you asleep?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.218
Mary, it's late.

18:58.011 --> 19:01.013
- What is it?
- We haven't had any dinner.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.182
What time is it?

19:04.268 --> 19:05.893
Late.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.730
Will Padovani's be open?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.859
- Or what about...?
- No. It's quite late.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.944
Too late. All closed.

19:15.028 --> 19:18.698
But I know a very good bar.
Late-night bar.

19:18.782 --> 19:24.579
Nice sandwich. Good drinks.
Very nice place. Very easy to find.

19:24.663 --> 19:30.459
- All right. We'll have to take a map.
- All out. It's my only one, sorry.

19:30.544 --> 19:34.881
- Let me look.
- Here. You see? Very nice.

19:34.965 --> 19:40.219
You go straight out of here.
Turn and take a right.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.514
Then you turn and take a right.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.892
Right there.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.146
Right. Thanks.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.689
- Look, this way.
- How do you know?

21:09.977 --> 21:12.061
What do you think?

21:30.914 --> 21:36.043
- Yes, there we are.
- No. It's definitely this way.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.212
I'm sorry, but it is.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.641
(Mary groans)

21:55.022 --> 21:57.398
- This way?
- All right.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.817
Colin...

22:05.490 --> 22:07.575
What's that?

22:08.618 --> 22:10.911
(Colin laughs)

22:10.996 --> 22:13.497
(Mary) Look at that bed.

22:23.800 --> 22:29.096
- She reminds me of someone.
- It's like a space shuttle.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.891
What do you think? Where are we?

22:32.809 --> 22:34.727
Is this right?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.896
Yes, definitely.

22:40.650 --> 22:45.571
- Look at all this.
- Collettivo Femminista Venezia.

22:45.655 --> 22:49.492
- Women are so radical here.
- I wish we had a map.

22:49.576 --> 22:53.537
They want convicted rapists castrated.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.375
See this building?

22:58.919 --> 23:02.171
We've been past this building
about ten minutes ago.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.507
Quite right too.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.385
- What is?
- To castrate rapists.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.365
What was that man doing?

23:29.449 --> 23:31.617
Glass at this time of night?

23:31.701 --> 23:33.994
- Come on.
- Very strange.

23:39.918 --> 23:43.546
- I'm starving.
- I think we're on the right track.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.714
So do I.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.717
Good evening. You need help?

23:50.303 --> 23:51.971
Well...

23:52.973 --> 23:55.933
We're looking for a place
to get something to eat.

23:56.017 --> 24:01.063
There's nothing in that direction, but I can
show you a very good place that way.

24:01.148 --> 24:06.819
- Isn't there a bar just over there?
- No. Everything is closed.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.613
- My name is Robert.
- Hello.

24:09.698 --> 24:13.909
- Like to eat some beautiful food?
- We'd love to.

24:13.994 --> 24:19.498
I'll show you this place.
You must both be terribly hungry.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.917
All right. Let's go.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.256
This is Mary. I'm Colin.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.967
- You're English?
- Yes.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.719
Whereabouts?

24:31.803 --> 24:34.847
Mary's from Bristol and I'm from London.

24:34.931 --> 24:37.475
Beautiful country.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.352
- Your first trip here?
- We came three years ago.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.522
- Two years ago.
- Two.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.192
- Changed much, has it?
- Mm...

24:49.946 --> 24:52.656
These posters are everywhere.

24:53.783 --> 24:57.077
These are women who can't find a man.

24:57.162 --> 25:01.457
They want to destroy everything
that's good between men and women.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.502
They don't know what they want.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.964
This way.

25:18.308 --> 25:22.144
- Ciao, ragazzi. Come va?
- Bene, grazie.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.781
It's very easy to get lost.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.867
Often there's a dead end or a canal.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.703
(laughs)

25:42.290 --> 25:44.375
It's not far.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.205
Buona sera, Robert.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.957
Please.

26:29.212 --> 26:32.631
Monica. Jocelyn. Ça va.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.721
This way, please.

26:58.074 --> 27:00.326
It's the real Venice.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.165
Excuse me.

27:19.596 --> 27:23.223
There's no food. I'm sorry.
The cook is sick.

27:23.266 --> 27:27.728
It's a tragedy. I could kill him.
Very sorry.

27:27.812 --> 27:32.191
But this is a wonderful wine.
Full of nourishment.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.325
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.498
Now, tell me.

27:47.582 --> 27:51.377
I'm a man of immense curiosity.
Passionate curiosity.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.170
- Are you married?
- No.

27:53.254 --> 27:56.298
- But you live together in sin.
- No.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.926
Why not? No one would stop you.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.054
In this day and age
there are no standards.

28:02.138 --> 28:07.351
What about you? Tell us a bit about you.
I mean... who are you, anyway?

28:09.270 --> 28:12.898
But you have a child. Am I right?

28:12.982 --> 28:15.067
- How did you know?
- I feel it.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.529
I have two children.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.739
A boy and a girl.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.958
- This is your boy and your girl.
- Yes.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.961
Beautiful.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.130
Not yours.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.048
Not mine.

28:39.759 --> 28:45.305
Beautiful children.
They take after their beautiful mother.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.226
Your English is terribly good.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.105
I grew up in London. My wife is Canadian.

28:53.189 --> 28:55.566
Any more breadsticks?

28:55.650 --> 28:58.360
- Ancora vino. E dei grissini.
- Arrivo subito.

28:58.445 --> 29:02.614
- Your wife's Canadian?
- Certainly. We lived there.

29:03.366 --> 29:05.451
How did you meet?

29:06.453 --> 29:10.956
That's impossible to explain without
describing my mother and sisters

29:11.040 --> 29:14.251
and that would only make sense
if I described my father.

29:14.335 --> 29:19.506
In order to explain how I met my wife
I would have to describe my father.

29:19.591 --> 29:24.011
Would you really like me to do that?
Shall I do that?

29:24.095 --> 29:29.433
- All right.
- My father was a... very big man.

29:30.477 --> 29:34.271
All his life he wore a black moustache.

29:34.355 --> 29:38.066
When it turned grey
he used a little brush to keep it black,

29:38.151 --> 29:41.320
such as ladies use
for their eyes - mascara.

29:41.404 --> 29:45.783
Everyone was afraid of him.
My mother, my four sisters.

29:45.867 --> 29:50.370
At the dining table you could not speak
unless spoken to first by my father.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.749
But he loved me.
I was his favourite.

29:54.292 --> 30:00.172
He was a diplomat all his life.
We spent years in London. Knightsbridge.

30:00.256 --> 30:05.469
Every morning he got out of bed at six
and went to the bathroom to shave.

30:05.553 --> 30:09.014
No one was allowed out of bed
until he'd finished.

30:09.057 --> 30:13.435
My eldest sisters were 14, 15. I was 10.

30:13.520 --> 30:17.147
One weekend the house was empty
for the whole afternoon.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.901
My sisters whispered together.
Their names were Eva and Maria.

30:20.985 --> 30:24.571
They called me and they led me
into my parents' bedroom.

30:24.656 --> 30:28.158
They told me to sit
on the bed and be quiet.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.703
They went to my mother's dressing table.

30:32.539 --> 30:38.126
They painted their fingernails, they put
powder on their faces, they used lipstick.

30:38.211 --> 30:42.589
They pulled hairs from their eyebrows
and brushed mascara on their lashes.

30:42.674 --> 30:47.469
(laughs) They took off their socks and put
on my mother's silk stockings, panties.

30:47.554 --> 30:54.351
They sauntered about the room looking
at the mirror, like beautiful women.

30:54.435 --> 31:00.691
They laughed and kissed, they stroked
each other, they giggled. I was enchanted.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.860
They fed my enchantment.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.904
(romantic ballad)

31:05.989 --> 31:09.491
They whispered to me
that it was our secret,

31:09.534 --> 31:14.705
that we would keep it in our hearts
forever, never reveal it.

31:14.747 --> 31:20.878
But that night at dinner I felt my father
staring at me, staring deep into me.

31:20.962 --> 31:25.841
He chewed, swallowed, he put his
knife and fork down. He looked at me.

31:25.925 --> 31:29.761
My heart started to beat.
To thump, not to beat.

31:30.513 --> 31:35.434
My father said "Tell me, Robert. What
have you been doing this afternoon?"

31:35.518 --> 31:37.978
He knew.

31:38.062 --> 31:41.773
I knew he knew.
He was God. He was testing me.

31:41.858 --> 31:48.113
So I told him. I told him all that my sisters
had done. I told him everything.

31:49.407 --> 31:55.537
My mother was silent. My sisters'
faces were white. No one spoke.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.250
My father said "Thank you."
Finished his dinner.

32:00.335 --> 32:04.922
After dinner my sisters and I
were called to my father's study.

32:05.006 --> 32:11.011
They were beaten with a leather belt
without mercy. I watched this.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.681
A month later they took their revenge.

32:14.766 --> 32:20.103
We children were again alone
in the house. Nanny was away.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.147
My youngest sisters...

32:22.231 --> 32:24.066
Grazie.

32:24.150 --> 32:27.736
...Alice and Lisa
came to me in the garden.

32:28.613 --> 32:33.909
They said "Robert, come to the kitchen.
Eva and Maria have a treat for you."

32:33.993 --> 32:36.411
I was suspicious, but I went.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.164
I was so...

32:39.207 --> 32:40.749
innocent.

32:40.833 --> 32:44.336
On the table were two big bottles
of lemonade, cream cake,

32:44.420 --> 32:47.130
cooking chocolate,
big box of marshmallows,

32:47.215 --> 32:49.841
and Maria said
"Look, this is all for you."

32:49.926 --> 32:53.136
"But first" Eva said
"you must drink some medicine."

32:53.221 --> 33:01.228
"This is very rich food and it will protect
your stomach. Help you to enjoy it."

33:01.312 --> 33:05.357
I was too greedy to question this.
I drank the medicine.

33:05.441 --> 33:09.569
Then I ate the chocolate and the cake
and drank a bottle of lemonade.

33:09.654 --> 33:14.366
They applauded and said that only a man
could drink a second bottle of lemonade.

33:14.450 --> 33:19.705
It would be beyond my capabilities.
I said "Give it to me."

33:19.789 --> 33:25.127
I drank the second bottle and I finished
the chocolate, marshmallows and cake.

33:25.211 --> 33:30.215
They said "Bravo", then
the kitchen began to spin round me

33:30.299 --> 33:34.011
and I badly needed to go
to the lavatory.

33:35.596 --> 33:38.849
Suddenly Eva and Maria held me down

33:38.933 --> 33:42.936
and tied my hands together
with a long piece of rope behind my back

33:43.021 --> 33:47.065
and dragged me into my father's study.

33:47.150 --> 33:51.236
They took the key from the inside,
slammed the door and locked it.

33:51.320 --> 33:58.285
"Bye-bye, Robert" they called.
"Now you are big Papa in his study."

33:58.369 --> 34:04.499
I was locked in my revered,
my feared father's study

34:04.584 --> 34:09.045
where he received the diplomatic corps
of London, the elite of the world.

34:09.130 --> 34:15.469
And I puked and pissed and shat
all over my father's carpets and walls.

34:15.553 --> 34:19.514
My father found me there.
He said "Robert..."

34:23.811 --> 34:26.396
"Have you been eating chocolate?"

34:26.481 --> 34:32.194
Then he nearly killed me. Then
he didn't speak to me for six months.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.864
I've never forgiven my sisters.

34:39.034 --> 34:42.036
My only solace was my mother.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.414
I grew so thirsty at night,

34:44.498 --> 34:48.960
she brought me a glass of water every
night and laid her hand upon my brow.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.172
She was... so tender.

34:52.965 --> 34:56.927
When my father was away
I slept in her bed.

34:57.011 --> 35:03.767
One afternoon, the wife of the
Canadian ambassador was invited to tea.

35:03.851 --> 35:07.395
She brought her daughter Caroline.

35:07.480 --> 35:13.068
When my mother showed her mother our
garden we were left alone, the children.

35:13.152 --> 35:18.990
Suddenly Eva said "Miss Caroline,
do you sleep with your mother?"

35:22.328 --> 35:24.454
Caroline said "No. Do you?"

35:24.539 --> 35:28.500
And Eva said "He does."

35:29.836 --> 35:34.256
And all my sisters giggled, and Caroline
looked at me and smiled and said:

35:34.340 --> 35:37.676
"I think that's really awfully sweet."

35:37.760 --> 35:40.262
And she became my wife.

35:45.852 --> 35:52.566
Not at that moment, of course. We were
both only... 11 years old at the time.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.999
Where on earth are we?

36:11.085 --> 36:13.170
Do you know?

36:13.671 --> 36:16.590
Let me sit down. I've got such a...

36:17.675 --> 36:20.260
I've got such a headache.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.764
Can you press the back of my neck?

36:24.849 --> 36:26.933
Just there.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.897
- Oh, God. I'm going to...
- What?

36:34.150 --> 36:36.234
(retches)

36:41.199 --> 36:43.283
(Coughs)

36:47.330 --> 36:49.456
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.877
I'm all right. I just have to sit down.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.213
I can't walk any more.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.550
Hold me.

37:06.140 --> 37:08.850
What a terrible man.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.019
Who was he?

37:17.360 --> 37:19.694
We're on holiday.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.439
(schoolgirls chant)

38:30.933 --> 38:32.809
[Wary-

38:33.853 --> 38:35.937
Wake up.

38:38.024 --> 38:41.985
- Where are we?
- I don't know. Venice. Come on.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.447
Come on.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.743
You're a weight.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.639
I've been bitten.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.017
Try not to scratch.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.479
I'm so thirsty.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.984
You're going to have to
look after me today.

39:23.069 --> 39:27.322
- Why? Did you look after me yesterday?
- (laughs)

39:31.577 --> 39:33.661
I'm so thirsty.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.332
(Ship's horn)

39:37.458 --> 39:42.045
There's the waterfront.
Come on. There'll be a cafe.

39:55.726 --> 39:58.186
Let's go in the shade.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.773
(Mary yawns)

40:16.122 --> 40:18.373
We'd like to order something to drink.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.959
I will tell your waiter.

40:40.896 --> 40:43.731
I wonder how the children are.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.069
Well, you spoke to them, when was it?

40:48.154 --> 40:51.573
- Was it yesterday?
- How were they then?

40:52.491 --> 40:54.993
It's like a prison here.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.913
Let's go home.

41:02.126 --> 41:06.880
- The flight's paid for. It's not for five days.
- We could get another one.

41:06.964 --> 41:10.091
Why do you want to go home?
Excuse me!

41:11.886 --> 41:14.053
I can't believe it. He's coming.

41:14.138 --> 41:20.393
Bringing the children with us would have
made all the difference. To me, anyway.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.774
- Signore?
- A jug of water, please. With ice.

41:26.817 --> 41:30.195
- Water?
- Um... coffee.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.906
- Croissant? Eggs? Juice?
- No, just water.

41:32.990 --> 41:37.202
- Let's go to the hotel and get water there.
- All right.

41:37.244 --> 41:40.622
He's probably bringing it anyway.

41:41.415 --> 41:44.167
I don't know why we came here.

41:45.169 --> 41:49.130
We've been here before.
Why did we come again?

41:53.177 --> 41:56.095
Actually, I remember why we came.

41:57.723 --> 42:01.684
We thought we'd find out
what to do, didn't we?

42:02.937 --> 42:05.647
What to do about you and me.

42:08.984 --> 42:10.610
Well?

42:12.613 --> 42:15.114
Have you found out?

42:16.242 --> 42:22.080
I haven't. I just want to go home.
To my own bed and my kids.

42:28.921 --> 42:31.005
Or maybe you have.

42:31.882 --> 42:35.093
Maybe you have decided what you want.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.596
What you want to do.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.893
Have you?

42:50.234 --> 42:51.568
No.

43:03.289 --> 43:07.458
Oh, God. We should have
gone back to the hotel.

43:12.756 --> 43:15.466
He's missed us.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.277
My friends.

43:35.821 --> 43:39.032
- How are you both?
- Terrible. We slept in the street.

43:39.116 --> 43:41.200
Street?

43:41.285 --> 43:44.912
- After we left you...
- We didn't have a map.

43:44.997 --> 43:51.044
I'm horrified. It's entirely my fault. I kept
you late with wine and stupid stories.

43:51.128 --> 43:54.505
- Don't scratch. It's not a question of that.
- It's my fault.

43:54.590 --> 43:59.218
And it's my responsibility to correct it.
You must come to my house.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.430
- Your coffee.
- Senta. Lasci stare.

44:02.514 --> 44:04.599
(Colin) No, we have a hotel.

44:04.683 --> 44:10.396
My house is a thousand times
more comfortable, peaceful, serene.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.524
We take a taxi.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.610
Please.

44:16.695 --> 44:19.405
- What do you think?
- All right.

44:26.372 --> 44:28.456
(laughs) The street!

47:04.071 --> 47:07.782
- Where are we?
- Robert brought us here.

47:10.577 --> 47:13.788
Robert. Where's he?

47:13.872 --> 47:15.957
I don't know.

47:20.170 --> 47:22.255
What time is it?

47:22.339 --> 47:24.006
Evening.

47:25.676 --> 47:29.637
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, wonderfully.

47:38.313 --> 47:40.857
How's your bite?

47:40.941 --> 47:43.192
It's gone.

47:43.235 --> 47:45.444
Where's my watch?

47:47.322 --> 47:49.490
Where's our clothes?

47:52.286 --> 47:54.579
Have you seen them?

48:07.551 --> 48:09.635
Not in there.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.904
Not in here.

48:27.988 --> 48:29.739
No?

48:32.534 --> 48:35.745
Don't you think we ought to find them?

48:38.123 --> 48:40.791
- I feel good.
- I must find out what's going on.

48:40.876 --> 48:44.295
I just can't walk around here
stark bloody naked.

48:44.379 --> 48:48.841
I think there's a dressing gown
hanging up in there.

48:55.807 --> 48:58.309
I can't wear this. Look.

49:01.647 --> 49:04.815
Yes, you can. You look lovely.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.944
You look like a god.

49:08.946 --> 49:12.365
I think I'm going to have to
take you to bed.

49:12.449 --> 49:18.955
- This isn't a dressing gown, it's a nightie.
- You've no idea how good you feel in it.

49:19.039 --> 49:22.708
I can't walk around a stranger's house
dressed like this.

49:22.793 --> 49:25.086
Not with an erection!

49:30.384 --> 49:32.468
Here. Put it on.

49:33.345 --> 49:35.930
Find out what's going on.

49:50.737 --> 49:52.822
How do I look?

50:09.464 --> 50:11.716
Hello.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.885
I'm Caroline, Robert's wife.

50:14.970 --> 50:18.097
- Well, you're looking rested!
- Hello.

50:18.181 --> 50:20.766
Come outside. It's nice.

50:26.064 --> 50:27.690
- Wow!
- Mm.

50:27.774 --> 50:33.070
It is beautiful, isn't it? I spend
as much time as possible out here.

50:33.155 --> 50:36.574
- I'm Mary Kenway.
- Yes, I know.

50:37.826 --> 50:40.745
- Come and sit down.
- Is this yours?

50:42.039 --> 50:43.956
Yes.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.875
I made it.

50:45.959 --> 50:49.462
I sometimes sit out here
and do embroidery. I like embroidery.

50:49.546 --> 50:51.756
It's lovely.

50:51.840 --> 50:55.801
- Would you like a biscuit? Take one.
- Thanks.

50:56.803 --> 51:01.682
You must be hungry. Robert wants you
to stay for dinner. He'll be back for dinner.

51:01.767 --> 51:06.020
He's gone to his bar.
A new manager starts there tonight.

51:06.104 --> 51:08.898
- His bar?
- Yes.

51:08.982 --> 51:12.818
You were there last night, weren't you?

51:12.944 --> 51:18.157
- He didn't say it was his bar.
- It's a kind of a hobby, I guess.

51:19.076 --> 51:24.080
But you know more about it than I do.
I've never been there.

51:28.627 --> 51:32.046
Have you done something to your back?

51:32.130 --> 51:37.134
It helps to move. Sometimes
I just stand up and move about.

51:39.012 --> 51:42.223
- Are you fond of your friend?
- Colin?

51:44.476 --> 51:49.313
I hope you don't mind.
There's something I must tell you.

51:51.358 --> 51:55.402
While you were both asleep
I came in and looked at you both.

51:55.487 --> 52:01.742
I just sat on the chaise for half an hour.
I just sat there and looked at you both.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.286
Oh.

52:07.415 --> 52:11.669
Colin is very beautiful, isn't he?
Robert said he was.

52:11.753 --> 52:16.966
You are too, of course.
You both have such wonderful skin.

52:20.011 --> 52:21.971
Are you in love?

52:22.055 --> 52:24.140
Well, I...

52:25.142 --> 52:28.519
I do love him. I suppose.

52:28.603 --> 52:31.564
Not quite like when we first met.

52:31.648 --> 52:35.317
I trust him, really.
He's my closest friend.

52:35.402 --> 52:38.320
But what do you mean by "in love"?

52:39.531 --> 52:43.868
I mean that you'd do absolutely
anything for the other person.

52:43.952 --> 52:48.247
And you'd let them do
absolutely anything to you.

52:48.331 --> 52:50.332
Anything?

52:50.834 --> 52:54.044
- If you're in love with somebody, you...
- (door opens)

53:01.386 --> 53:06.348
- Hello!
- Colin, this is Caroline, Robert's wife.

53:06.433 --> 53:09.435
- Are you having a nice time?
- Um...

53:09.519 --> 53:13.272
- On your holiday?
- Yes, except we keep getting lost.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.441
Pull up a chair.

53:18.695 --> 53:20.279
Oh, my God.

53:20.363 --> 53:22.031
What?

53:22.115 --> 53:27.828
Your clothes. I forgot.
I washed and dried them. I clean forgot.

53:27.913 --> 53:29.997
I must tell you where they are.

53:30.081 --> 53:33.209
But before I do you should tell him
what I told you.

53:33.293 --> 53:37.588
- What?
- What I did while you were both asleep.

53:37.672 --> 53:39.965
Oh. Right.

53:41.343 --> 53:45.679
Caroline came in and looked at us
both whilst we were asleep.

53:45.764 --> 53:47.556
Oh, did She?

53:48.934 --> 53:50.601
Yes.

53:51.811 --> 53:56.065
You were so peaceful.
Just like a baby.

53:57.275 --> 54:02.488
- Babies can be very ratty in their sleep.
- Oh, no, not him.

54:02.572 --> 54:07.660
- I'm sure he always sleeps sweetly.
- Yes, but I'm not a baby.

54:07.744 --> 54:12.206
I never said you were.
I only said that you slept like a baby.

54:12.290 --> 54:18.379
Now, listen. Robert is very keen for you
to stay and have dinner with us.

54:18.421 --> 54:22.299
He told me not to let you
have your clothes till you agreed.

54:22.384 --> 54:23.717
(laughter)

54:23.802 --> 54:26.387
You must be starving, anyway.

54:27.389 --> 54:29.431
So you will?

54:30.892 --> 54:34.478
- Well, I...
- Oh, please. If you don't, he'll blame me.

54:34.562 --> 54:37.481
- (Colin) Let's stay.
- Oh, good.

54:40.318 --> 54:43.445
And... now can I have my clothes?

54:44.948 --> 54:49.827
They're locked in your
bathroom cupboard. Here's the key.

54:49.911 --> 54:52.913
- Thanks.
- Just through there.

54:58.169 --> 55:01.839
Isn't it sweet when men are shy?

55:01.923 --> 55:03.882
It's so sweet.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.635
Tell me, what do you do?
Do you work?

55:06.720 --> 55:12.766
Well, I mainly do voice-overs these days.
Commercials.

55:12.851 --> 55:16.562
I was with a women's group
until about six months ago.

55:16.646 --> 55:20.274
- What do you mean, a women's group?
- A theatre group.

55:20.358 --> 55:26.113
You're an actress?
What a beautiful thing that must be.

55:26.197 --> 55:29.783
Well, sometimes.
Anyway, the group broke up, so...

55:29.868 --> 55:33.120
Women. It was all women?

55:33.872 --> 55:40.294
Some of us wanted to bring in men and
the rest of them wanted to keep it pure.

55:40.378 --> 55:42.463
That's what broke us up.

55:42.547 --> 55:48.260
How can you do a play with only women?
I mean, what could happen?

55:48.345 --> 55:51.972
Happen? Well, you...

55:52.057 --> 55:56.143
You could have a play about
two women who have only just met

55:56.227 --> 56:00.064
sitting on a balcony talking.

56:00.148 --> 56:04.151
- But they'd probably be waiting for a man.
- (laughs)

56:04.235 --> 56:09.031
And then he'd come.
And then something would happen.

56:13.661 --> 56:15.746
(gasp of pain)

56:18.291 --> 56:21.335
- It hurts when I laugh.
- Can I do anything?

56:21.419 --> 56:24.546
Would you touch me here on my neck?

56:24.589 --> 56:27.132
There. Press it.

56:27.217 --> 56:29.468
No, harder.

56:29.552 --> 56:32.388
Yeah. That's it, thank you.

56:38.812 --> 56:42.815
- We did an all-women Hamlet once.
- Hamlet?

56:43.149 --> 56:49.029
I've never read that play. In fact, I haven't
seen a play since I was at school.

56:49.114 --> 56:55.369
Isn't that the one with the ghost,
and then everybody dies at the end?

56:55.453 --> 56:58.330
- Were you the star?
- No.

56:58.415 --> 57:00.499
- Hello.
- Hello.

57:01.459 --> 57:04.670
- Have you slept well?
- Wonderfully.

57:04.754 --> 57:07.464
- What an apartment.
- I'll get the glasses.

57:07.549 --> 57:10.259
It belonged to my grandfather.

57:11.469 --> 57:13.554
You see that island?

57:14.222 --> 57:20.477
That's Cemetery Island. My grandfather
and my father are both buried there.

57:22.814 --> 57:27.693
- You're staying for dinner, I trust?
- I'll get dressed.

57:28.695 --> 57:31.280
A glass of champagne first.

57:36.786 --> 57:38.662
Carolina!

57:56.639 --> 57:58.724
Thank you.

57:59.976 --> 58:02.478
You look like an angel.

58:05.732 --> 58:07.983
How are you feeling?

58:08.067 --> 58:09.568
Better.

58:09.652 --> 58:11.737
To Colin and Mary.

58:15.992 --> 58:18.994
- Dinner.
- I'd better get dressed.

58:29.714 --> 58:31.798
Thank you.

58:46.564 --> 58:48.732
Beautiful place.

59:02.413 --> 59:06.083
These books are the favourite
literature of my father.

59:06.167 --> 59:08.293
And my grandfather.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.462
All first editions.

59:13.299 --> 59:17.970
These are things my father
used every day. Small things.

59:18.930 --> 59:25.310
- He used opera glasses every day?
- No. He used opera glasses at the opera.

59:27.355 --> 59:30.274
They belonged to my grandfather.

59:31.359 --> 59:36.697
Your father seems to be...
very important to you.

59:36.781 --> 59:40.909
My father and his father
understood themselves clearly.

59:40.994 --> 59:44.955
They were men
and they were proud of their sex.

59:45.039 --> 59:47.165
Women understood them too.

59:47.250 --> 59:51.837
Now women treat men like children
because they can't take them seriously,

59:51.921 --> 59:57.301
but men like my father and grandfather
women took very seriously.

59:57.385 --> 01:00:01.555
There was no uncertainty.
No confusion.

01:00:05.643 --> 01:00:07.311
So.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:16.361
This is a museum.
Dedicated to the good old days, hm?

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:57.152
(faint conversation)

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:07.621
So, how is England?
Lovely, dear old England?

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:11.208
Hampshire, Wiltshire,
Cumberland, Yorkshire?

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:12.876
Harrods?

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:17.047
Such a beautiful country.
Such beautiful traditions.

01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:21.593
Well, it's not quite so beautiful now.
Is it, Colin?

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:25.430
- Colin, are you feeling all right?
- Mm.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:28.850
In what way?
In what way not beautiful?

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.728
Oh...

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.397
I don't know.

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:36.024
Freedom. You know?

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:40.237
Freedom? What kind of freedom?
Freedom to do what?

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.574
- Freedom to be free.
- You want to be free?

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:49.830
- Free to do what?
- You don't believe in it?

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:55.085
Sure I believe in it, but sometimes
a few rules, you know, not a bad thing.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:02:02.008
First, society has to be protected
from perverts. Everybody knows that.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:08.014
My position is simple. Put them all
up against the wall and shoot them.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:11.101
What society needs to do is purify itself.

01:02:11.185 --> 01:02:14.438
The English government's
going in the right direction.

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:17.774
We could learn a lot of lessons from them.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:23.238
I'm an Englishman, and I have to say I
disagree violently with what you just said.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.449
I think it's Shit.

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:34.082
I respect you as an English man.
But not if you're a communist poof.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.337
You're not a poof, are you?

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.549
It's the right word, no? Or is it fruit?

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:48.680
Talking about fruit, it's time for coffee.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:52.184
- No, I think we should be going.
- Yes, we must.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:55.812
- But coffee!
- No, we've stayed far too long already.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:59.149
- But thank you so much.
- You're tired.

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:00.859
Thank you.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:05.947
Our hotel won't seem quite the same
after your apartment.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:19.127
Oh.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.962
Nice.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:23.548
I'm a keen amateur photographer.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.135
- So we go straight on till we get to the...
- Take the bridge.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.640
Please. Please come back.
Please. It's important.

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.892
(whispers) I can't get out.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:37.646
- Love to.
- It's my back. The stairs.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:44.152
Anyway, thank you so much
for your kindness. Good night.

01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:50.492
- It's meant a great deal to us.
- Good night.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:19.563
You know, when I saw you on that
terrace tonight, in that nightdress...

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.905
you looked so beautiful...

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.119
my heart... jumped.

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:40.625
But I told you how you looked
in that nightdress, didn't I?

01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:11.531
- (maid knocks) Permesso.
- (Colin) oh, please!

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:15.785
- Dovrei pulire la stanza.
- (Colin) We're on our bloody holiday.

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:23.335
(Mary) Come here. Come here.

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:41.895
What's it like?

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:46.608
I often wonder what it feels like.

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:48.818
What's what like?

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:54.908
What's it feel like to be the girl?
I mean the feeling of being...

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.832
It feels...

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:04.793
like...

01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:07.420
this.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.447
(Mary) I'm crazy about you.

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:41.287
(Colin) I'm crazy about you.

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:03.560
Don't open the shutters.

01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:05.562
Come here.

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:07.856
Come here.

01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:10.734
Sit down.

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:15.572
Ow!

01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:17.699
- I want you.
- No.

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:20.285
No? Yes.

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.037
No.

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:47.812
- Wasn't that maid extraordinary?
- (Colin) Listen.

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:53.109
Why did they do that to you, those kids?
Why did they hound you out of that gang?

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:56.321
Because they didn't like me.

01:07:57.281 --> 01:08:03.203
They were jealous, that's what it was.
They were jealous of your beauty.

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:10.919
I am myself.
You know that, don't you?

01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:14.672
I'm... jealous of your beauty.

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:26.850
In that it belongs to me.
Jealous in that sense.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:31.189
No one else can touch it. It's all mine.

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.358
Is it?

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:38.363
All mine. It's my possession.

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:42.450
- I'm possessed!
- Avete visto quei due inglesi?

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.410
Colin.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:45.870
What?

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.832
- È carino.
- Anche lei è molto bella.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:52.417
You know what those people are doing?

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:55.046
- What?
- They're talking about us.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.881
- About you.
- No, you.

01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:01.051
- Or perhaps us.
- (laughs)

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:06.349
This actually reminds me. You know
all this thing about thighs and bottoms?

01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:08.893
- What thing?
- You know.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:13.689
People look at other people's thighs and
bottoms and say "Christ, what thighs!"

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:18.694
Or "What an arse!" "What an ass."
"What tits", of course.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:24.408
What tits, what boobs, what a can.
If you see what I mean.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.786
I mean, what I mean is...

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:31.457
Well, my first point is that
only the word "thighs" is constant.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:36.129
You've got all these other words for all
the other words but only one for thighs.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:41.091
- Isn't that incredible?
- You don't need another word.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.011
- What's your question?
- This.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:50.059
When people look at you and... talk about
your thighs and your bottom, or both,

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:55.982
what sense of your thighs and your
bottom do you at such a time have?

01:09:57.109 --> 01:10:00.486
People aren't talking about
my thighs or my bottom.

01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:03.114
How can you know that?

01:10:04.074 --> 01:10:11.080
Because the whole restaurant is talking
about your thighs and your bottom.

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:14.500
Mine? No, I don't think so.

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:17.295
Really?

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.217
(splutters)

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.887
- Incredible.
- (laughs)

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:34.938
Oh.

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.649
- I forgot to tell you.
- What?

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:39.984
I had rather a good idea.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:44.906
I'm going to hire a surgeon.

01:10:45.866 --> 01:10:48.451
A very handsome surgeon.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.165
- To cut off your arms and your legs.
- Oh, really?

01:10:54.208 --> 01:11:00.588
And I'll keep you in a room in my house.
And use you just for sex.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:03.383
Whenever I feel like it.

01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:08.012
And sometimes
I'll lend you to my girlfriends

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.182
and they can do what they like with you.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.851
It's funny you should say that.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:17.355
I've come to a decision myself
and I haven't told you yet.

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:22.277
- A decision?
- Mm. I've come to this decision.

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:25.071
- What is it?
- Well...

01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:29.409
I'm going to invent a machine.

01:11:29.493 --> 01:11:34.330
Made of steel. Powered by electricity.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:39.335
- It has controls, pistons...
- Mmm...

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:46.259
It has straps, dials.
And it makes a low hum. Like this.

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:47.593
(hums)

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:49.470
Like that?

01:11:49.596 --> 01:11:52.724
And the machine will fuck you.

01:11:54.351 --> 01:12:01.399
Not just for hours and days, but for years
and years and years and years.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:04.319
Forever.

01:12:46.236 --> 01:12:47.987
[Wary-

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:51.199
You were having a nightmare. Mary.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.871
What is it?

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.542
What is it?

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:06.631
You were having a terrible dream.
What is it?

01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:18.226
You are beautiful.

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:23.439
- Are you awake?
- I'm so afraid.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:24.565
Shh.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.734
What is it?

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.988
Touch me.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.156
Shh.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:36.285
Come on. Let's go back.
Come on. Let's sit down.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:41.249
What is it? You had a terrible dream.

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:43.126
- Do you remember it?
- Mm.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.628
Tell me. What was it?

01:13:45.712 --> 01:13:50.299
There was a photograph
at Robert's apartment.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.345
It was of you.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.140
What photograph?

01:13:57.224 --> 01:14:01.769
I looked through some photographs
at Robert's apartment.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:04.355
One of them was of you.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.193
Of me?

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:17.994
It must have been taken from outside.
From a boat or along the waterfront.

01:14:18.078 --> 01:14:21.038
You were standing on this balcony.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:26.002
- But I didn't see any photograph.
- No, you didn't see it.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.966
- Don't fall asleep. Keep awake.
- I'm awake.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.429
You're in his photograph.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:41.058
Colin?

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:03.539
- What about over there?
- All right.

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:05.708
Come on.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:07.270
Something happened at Robert's flat.
I didn't tell you.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:12.984
- I can't hear you. What?
- Something happened. I didn't tell you.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.032
When you'd gone to change, to dress.
Remember?

01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:23.995
Well, he was talking to me.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.165
About his father and so on.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:35.089
And then suddenly he hit me
really hard in the stomach.

01:16:39.469 --> 01:16:42.471
- He totally winded me.
- He hit you?

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.850
But why?

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.188
Why didn't you say anything?

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.693
I don't know.

01:16:57.154 --> 01:17:00.948
I don't know why I didn't say anything.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.743
I don't know why he hit me.

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:11.083
And I don't know why he took
my photograph on the balcony, either.

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:17.089
I'm going for a swim.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.921
(Colin) Listen.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:59.298
I've been thinking.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.053
Why don't we do it?

01:18:04.137 --> 01:18:06.555
- Do what?
- Get together.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:09.725
You know.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:13.270
Live together with the children.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.439
I mean it.

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.943
I love you.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:27.034
Yes, but we don't have to
commit ourselves to all that. I mean...

01:18:27.994 --> 01:18:30.913
It's been such a lovely day.

01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:36.210
Don't you want to?
I thought you wanted to.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:41.632
I do, but... when I was swimming
out there and I was all alone,

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:44.802
I suddenly felt so... peaceful.

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:49.140
I can't describe it.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:52.059
I could have gone on forever.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:56.939
I can't get back to things like this
just like that.

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:10.202
I thought you wanted it.

01:19:14.374 --> 01:19:16.667
We'll see, shall we?

01:19:50.076 --> 01:19:55.122
It goes around the other side of the island,
then cuts through the harbour to our side.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.291
Let's take it, then.

01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:32.535
(Colin) We can get off at the next stop
and walk through.

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:36.247
- What?
- We can get off and walk through.

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:40.835
- Quicker than going round the harbour.
- Possibly.

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:42.586
Yes.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:30.676
See where we are?

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.804
Colin! Mary! Hi!

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.514
Hi!

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:40.603
Come up!

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:42.271
Come on up!

01:21:42.355 --> 01:21:47.568
- Do you want to go up?
- She's seen us. Can't very well be rude.

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:05.669
- Just across the canal, please. Over there.
- (Mary) Grazie.

01:23:19.035 --> 01:23:21.912
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.707
How delightful to see you.

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:31.046
The boat brought us round this side from
the beach, so we thought we'd say hello.

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:38.679
We were expecting you sooner.

01:23:38.763 --> 01:23:41.682
- You got my message?
- No. When?

01:23:41.766 --> 01:23:45.519
I left a message at your hotel today.
We're going away, you see.

01:23:45.603 --> 01:23:48.772
- We didn't want to miss you.
- No, we didn't get it.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:51.984
But you came anyway. How wonderful.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:55.696
Going away?

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.781
To Canada.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:03.245
To see my family, so we wanted
to say goodbye. Have a farewell drink.

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:06.373
Give Mary some refreshment.
I have to go to my bar.

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:09.710
I have business. Very quick.
Will you come with me?

01:24:09.794 --> 01:24:12.254
- I'll just...
- We won't be long.

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:15.257
- Colin, I...
- Have you been swimming?

01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:17.009
Yes.

01:24:20.096 --> 01:24:21.430
(locks door)

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:26.935
Good God.

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:32.316
- I thought you were going on holiday.
- We're selling up.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:37.321
We are going on holiday, but when we get
back we'll buy a ground-floor apartment.

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:39.573
- That's what I need.
- Oh.

01:24:40.366 --> 01:24:44.328
- Would you like some herb tea?
- I'd love some.

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:59.259
(they converse in Italian)

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:00.511
(laughter)

01:25:03.139 --> 01:25:07.518
- Ciao, Robert.
- Dove andate? Venite con noi.

01:25:29.999 --> 01:25:34.628
- Somebody just pinched me.
- Venetians are very friendly people.

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:36.797
This way.

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:47.975
Robert said he told you
about his childhood.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:55.190
He exaggerates, you know. He turns
his past into stories to tell at the bar.

01:25:56.776 --> 01:26:01.196
- No sugar for me.
- I'm just stirring in the lemon.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:05.242
- Shall we take it out onto the terrace?
- May I?

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.455
What happened to your back?

01:26:15.086 --> 01:26:17.171
(romantic ballad)

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.719
Sì, certo. È come hanno detto.

01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:26.847
Esattamente. Sì, sì, ho capito.

01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:29.516
Grazie. Allora posso stare tranquillo.

01:26:29.642 --> 01:26:31.894
Arrivederci.

01:26:31.978 --> 01:26:35.731
L'avvocato dice che il contratto è perfetto.

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:55.209
Did you understand what I was
telling people as we walked here?

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.586
No.

01:26:57.670 --> 01:27:00.172
I was telling them that...

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:07.888
you're my lover, and that Caroline
is jealous because she likes you too.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:14.811
- Why did you tell them that?
- Why "why"?

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:18.315
We knew you would come back.

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:22.027
Now, look here, Robert.
Hang on a minute.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:29.451
Why did you take that picture of me?
The one you showed Mary?

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:34.706
- She's very quick.
- What was the point?

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:40.587
I'm selling the bar.

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:42.464
To him.

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:55.936
I've never told anyone this - never -
but I want to tell you.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:04.194
Soon after we were married, Robert
started to hurt me when we made love.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:10.867
I tried to stop him, but he went on doing it.
And after a time, I found I liked it.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:18.834
Not the pain itself, but somehow...
the fact of being helpless before it.

01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:23.297
Being reduced to nothing by it.

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:28.260
And of being punished,
therefore being guilty.

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:32.639
I felt it was right that I should be punished.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.810
I thrilled to it.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:44.192
It took us over totally.
It grew and grew. It seemed never-ending.

01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:48.113
But there was an end to it.
We both knew what it was.

01:28:57.123 --> 01:29:00.042
That waiter was once a fisherman.

01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:05.756
But pollution has ruined the fish.
So fishermen become waiters.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:14.681
Why did you take my picture?
What does it mean?

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:24.274
You see that barbershop? My grandfather
and my father used that barbershop.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:27.069
And I use that barbershop.

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:32.324
That's Cemetery Island.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:44.461
My back happened suddenly one night.
It was very bad indeed.

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:50.384
And there was an incompetent surgeon.
So I'm like this.

01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:55.680
He's terribly strong, you see.

01:29:55.765 --> 01:30:01.103
When he bent my head backwards
I blacked out with the pain,

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:07.317
but I remember thinking
"it's going to happen. Now."

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:11.738
"There's no going back on it.
It's going to happen now."

01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:15.075
"This is it. This is the end."

01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:17.285
(Mary yawns)

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.162
I'm boring you.

01:30:20.706 --> 01:30:23.417
No, not at all. It's the...

01:30:24.627 --> 01:30:27.754
It's the sun, I think. The long swim.

01:30:31.968 --> 01:30:35.720
Do you and Colin do strange things?

01:30:38.349 --> 01:30:41.184
Oh, no, I don't think so. No.

01:30:41.727 --> 01:30:44.438
Oh, I'm sure Colin does.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.108
In fact, I'm certain he does.

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:51.903
I want to show you something.

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:02.414
- A bit dizzy.
- I must show you something.

01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:24.978
You haven't been in our bedroom,
have you?

01:31:26.522 --> 01:31:28.607
My legs ache.

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:54.257
(Caroline) God!

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.426
He's so beautiful.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:02.307
Robert saw you both
the first day you arrived.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:06.186
That was the first picture I saw of him.

01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:09.314
I'll never forget it.
Robert came home so excited.

01:32:09.398 --> 01:32:12.526
And then he brought
more and more photographs home.

01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:15.237
We became so close.

01:32:15.321 --> 01:32:17.614
Incredibly close.

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:20.742
Colin brought us together.

01:32:20.826 --> 01:32:26.665
It was my idea to put him on the wall
so we could see him as we made love.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:31.503
I took that one myself. Isn't it brilliant?

01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:35.924
- Why?
- And then Robert brought you home.

01:32:36.759 --> 01:32:39.678
It was as if God was in on our dream.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:47.269
I knew fantasy was passing into reality.
Have you ever experienced that?

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:50.397
It's like stepping into a mirror.

01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:52.107
(slurred) Colin.

01:32:52.191 --> 01:32:54.901
Colin.

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:59.406
- Wake up. Wake up.
- (door opens)

01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:02.200
Colin and Robert are back.

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:07.622
Do you know where we are now?

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:11.209
Shall I tell you?

01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:16.131
We are on the other side of the mirror.

01:33:36.527 --> 01:33:38.695
Mary, what is it?

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:43.074
Mary?

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:45.327
What is it?

01:33:45.369 --> 01:33:50.081
What's the matter?
Mary. What's the matter?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.667
Cheers.

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:58.423
- It's just a mild touch of sunstroke.
- She's not hot.

01:33:58.924 --> 01:34:01.551
What is it? Is it sunstroke?

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:04.054
Tell me. Try to tell me.

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:06.222
Tell me!

01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:08.975
- She's just tired.
- C...

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.395
Are trying to say my name?

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.565
- Co...
- What are you trying to say?

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:18.109
- Co...
- Cold.

01:34:19.695 --> 01:34:23.615
- She's cold.
- We shouldn't crowd her.

01:34:23.699 --> 01:34:27.202
She needs a doctor.
Where's the telephone?

01:34:27.286 --> 01:34:29.579
(Caroline) It's been disconnected.

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:33.083
- Disconnected?
- We're going away.

01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:41.299
You must know a doctor.

01:34:42.635 --> 01:34:46.012
Go and fetch a fucking doctor.
She's very ill!

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:51.643
- No need to shout.
- She'll be fine.

01:34:52.728 --> 01:34:55.313
Mary understands.

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:58.566
You understand too, don't you?

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:03.571
You understand.
You do understand, don't you?

01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:09.703
Don't you know where you are? Get up!

01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:16.376
Don't move.

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:19.295
You've cut my lip.

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:21.798
Shh!

01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:30.515
What have you done to Mary?

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:34.936
I'll do anything you want.
Just get a doctor for her.

01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:38.022
- What do you want?
- Want?

01:35:38.107 --> 01:35:41.359
I'll show you what we want.

01:35:41.444 --> 01:35:43.737
I'll show you.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.705
We'll show you.

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:08.511
(cries out)

01:36:59.897 --> 01:37:01.773
Carolina.

01:37:01.857 --> 01:37:03.733
Roberto.

01:37:25.256 --> 01:37:31.845
(man) What did you want
from these people? I ask you again.

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:35.223
What did you want from these people?

01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:39.310
Nothing. They were friends.

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:45.441
Friends?

01:37:48.737 --> 01:37:51.030
We had dinner there.

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:56.494
Why did you go back with your boyfriend
to these people?

01:37:57.413 --> 01:38:00.248
What did you want from them?

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:07.505
Did your boyfriend like the woman?

01:38:09.758 --> 01:38:12.886
I liked her. I don't think that he...

01:38:14.346 --> 01:38:17.432
Did your boyfriend like the man?

01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:20.852
No. No, he didn't.

01:38:20.936 --> 01:38:23.104
And you?

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:25.773
You liked the man?

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:29.319
- Did you like the man?
- No.

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:35.366
So, why did you go to dinner?
And why did you go back?

01:38:35.451 --> 01:38:40.038
Why did you come to Venice?
What were you looking for?

01:38:40.789 --> 01:38:46.044
- Nothing, we ju...
- Were you looking for... some fun?

01:38:48.964 --> 01:38:51.049
We were...

01:38:53.844 --> 01:38:56.554
We were going to get married.

01:39:04.813 --> 01:39:07.565
Is this the body of Colin Mayhew?

01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:12.946
Sign here.

01:39:23.832 --> 01:39:27.251
- Combed his hair the wrong way.
- Sorry?

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:31.422
It doesn't go this way.

01:39:38.263 --> 01:39:40.348
It goes this way.

01:40:46.331 --> 01:40:50.418
...a tourist, but now
you plan everything in advance.

01:40:50.502 --> 01:40:56.132
You sell your bar, you sell your apartment,
you buy drug, and so on and so on.

01:40:56.216 --> 01:41:00.511
And then on the other hand you leave
your razor with your fingerprints,

01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:07.226
you book a ticket under your own name
and you travel with your own passport.

01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:09.270
We don't get it.

01:41:09.354 --> 01:41:12.148
Listen. Let me tell you something.

01:41:12.232 --> 01:41:16.527
My father was a very big man.

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:21.491
All his life he wore a black moustache.

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:25.870
When it turned grey
he used a little brush to keep it black,

01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:29.457
such as ladies use for their eyes.

01:41:29.541 --> 01:41:31.626
Mascara.
