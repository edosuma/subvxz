WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:03.753
<i>Tonight, it's a competition
like no other.</i>

00:04.295 --> 00:06.471
<i>We brought 12 talented
special effects</i>

00:06.639 --> 00:08.041
<i>makeup artists to Los Angeles,</i>

00:08.208 --> 00:11.644
<i>where they'll compete
to join the world's elite.</i>

00:11.811 --> 00:14.431
<i>Week after week,
they'll face surprising challenges...</i>

00:14.681 --> 00:15.974
Drop 'em.

00:17.484 --> 00:19.752
Oh, my God.
What am I going to do?

00:19.919 --> 00:22.147
<i>... with seemingly
impossible deadlines.</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:23.940
[bleep] whoa!

00:24.257 --> 00:25.491
<i>As the pressure rises...</i>

00:25.658 --> 00:26.826
I'm having a panic attack.

00:26.993 --> 00:27.611
You want to [bleep]
do details, do details.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.030
I feel like I'm being
made out to be the bad guy here.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.130
<i>... some will crumble...</i>

00:31.297 --> 00:32.866
Whoa! You okay?

00:33.166 --> 00:34.534
I basically just lost
the [bleep] competition.

00:34.834 --> 00:35.994
We have no idea
what the hell we're doing.

00:36.269 --> 00:37.162
This might be the end.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.456
<i>... while others will shine.</i>

00:41.141 --> 00:43.209
- Holy [bleep].
- That's crazy.

00:43.610 --> 00:44.961
I think we found
our challenger over here.

00:45.278 --> 00:48.081
Time's up, everybody.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.149
<i>To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress</i>

00:50.316 --> 00:51.426
<i>our award-winning panel of judges-</i>

00:51.818 --> 00:53.820
<i>Ve Neill, the legendary
makeup artist,</i>

00:54.178 --> 00:56.014
<i>8-time Oscar nominee

01:20.814 --> 01:22.123
I'm a very, very
big fan of your work.

01:22.415 --> 01:22.999
I'm blown away.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.351
I love this challenge.

01:25.518 --> 01:26.586
<i>Who will be the next great name
in movie magic</i>

01:27.420 --> 01:29.422

02:17.904 --> 02:19.439
Tate: My name is Tate.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.574
I'm 31 and I live
in Brooklyn, New York.

02:21.741 --> 02:24.310
I've been doing special
effects for eight years.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.112
I am extremely excited
to show everyone what I can do.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.550
Megan: My name is Megan.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.694
I'm 24, from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.655
I am ecstatic to be here.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.366
Winning this
is very important to me.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.952
I don't want to clean up
shop floors anymore.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.163
Jo: I'm Jo Holland.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.541
I'm 21, straight out of school.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.585
My mother was very young
when she had me.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.504
She let me be creative
and do my own thing,

02:51.671 --> 02:54.407
and now I'm in
an industry that I love.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.142
That's why I would love to win this

02:56.309 --> 02:57.844
and I'd love to make her proud.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.479
- What's your name?
- Megan.

02:59.646 --> 03:00.847
- Megan, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.281
- And you?
- Anthony.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.683
- How you doing, Anthony?
- Nice to meet you, too.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.101
I own a makeup effects company
in New York City.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.520
I've been doing this about 15 years.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.148
I'm a self-proclaimed
MacGyver of makeup.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.233
I will take whatever
I need to to get it right.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.893
- How's it going, guys?
- How you doing?

03:14.060 --> 03:15.328
My name's Tom.

03:15.903 --> 03:17.263
Tom: I've been making
monsters for 11 years.

03:17.613 --> 03:18.798
I am very dyslexic.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.700
I have a real hard time
reading and writing.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.035
That's kind of why I chose the arts.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.703
- Tate.
- Tate!

03:23.870 --> 03:24.570
- Nice to meet you.
- Tom.

03:24.737 --> 03:25.772
Tom. Sergio.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.273
I'm from San Antonio, Texas.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.249
I'm 31 years old.

03:28.608 --> 03:29.334
Did everybody here go to school?

03:29.642 --> 03:30.794
Man: Yeah.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.779
Sergio: I've never really
had formal training,

03:32.946 --> 03:36.716
so it's a little scary because
it made me think about my shortcomings.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.885
Keep it going.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.786
It's a party.

03:42.322 --> 03:43.556
Gage: My name's Gage Hubbard.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.725
I've been in the business
for six years.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.562
I'm super excited to be
a part of this competition.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.064
It could make or break my career.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.441
- How are you?
- What's your name?

03:53.691 --> 03:55.401
Hey, what's up, Tom?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.403
Tommy and I have had
a long history of working together,

03:57.737 --> 04:00.039
and we can bump heads creatively.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.441
Tom: Definitely,
Gage was my protege.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.452
His first six films
were with me or from me.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.162
Frank: My name's Frank Ippolito.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.414
I've lived in Los Angeles
for 10 years.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.349
I'm in magazines, on TV,

04:10.516 --> 04:11.334
and I work on these giant movies.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.384
I can't settle for last.

04:15.188 --> 04:15.964
Conor: My name is Conor McCullagh.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.690
I currently live
in Orlando, Florida.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.692
I'm relying on the skills
that I've been honing

04:20.860 --> 04:22.637
for 20 years to win this thing.

04:25.498 --> 04:26.599
[chattering]

04:28.935 --> 04:31.688
McKenzie: Hey, guys.
Welcome to "Face Off".

04:32.071 --> 04:33.481
I'm your host, McKenzie Westmore.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.708
Gage: I know the Westmore name.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.111
Her whole family's
been a huge influence

04:38.511 --> 04:40.146
on the makeup industry for so long.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.824
Conor: Westmore is synonymous
with makeup effects,

04:43.149 --> 04:44.701
especially with all
the "Star Trek" series.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.161
I was very much in awe.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.537
Over the next coming weeks,

04:47.954 --> 04:49.555
you will all be put to the test

04:49.722 --> 04:51.557
as we determine who among you

04:51.724 --> 04:55.086
is the best special effects
makeup artist.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.296
Is everyone up for the challenge?

04:56.596 --> 04:57.930
All: Yes.

04:58.097 --> 05:01.567
Good, because your first competition

05:01.734 --> 05:02.719
starts right now.

05:04.570 --> 05:05.605
Megan: This is the first day,

05:05.772 --> 05:07.240
I have a cute little dress on,

05:07.407 --> 05:08.349
drinking champagne,

05:08.741 --> 05:10.743
and now you want to challenge me.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.178
Good God.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.280
This is a Foundation Challenge.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.617
Foundation Challenges
give you a perk or advantage

05:17.784 --> 05:18.860
going into the Spotlight Challenge,

05:19.252 --> 05:22.572
where someone will be
eliminated each week.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.359
Before we begin,
I would like to introduce you

05:26.526 --> 05:27.960
to your judge for this challenge.

05:28.127 --> 05:31.030
He's work on everything
from "Buffy" and "X-files"

05:31.197 --> 05:32.373
to "The Prestige" and "Legion".

05:32.765 --> 05:35.251
Please welcome Glenn Hetrick.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.907
- Hey, Glenn.
- Hello.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.634
Tate: Glenn's done everything,

05:42.975 --> 05:43.943
so when I heard he was a judge,

05:44.110 --> 05:45.345
I literally back-flipped.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.513
McKenzie: Everything
that you see in this room

05:47.847 --> 05:51.150
is going to be
a part of this challenge.

05:51.317 --> 05:54.729
In fact, your waiters
are going to be your models.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.255
Guys?

06:00.259 --> 06:01.494
Wow.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.997
Each model has a makeup kit
provided by Alcone.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.533
You're going to have to
create an original face makeup

06:07.800 --> 06:08.618
on your subjects.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.670
Wow, man.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.738
You're also
going to have to integrate

06:12.905 --> 06:15.875
at least one item from this party
into your makeup.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.112
And the stakes are huge.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.299
The winner tonight gets immunity from
this week's elimination.

06:26.285 --> 06:28.421
We're looking for
originality in your design.

06:28.763 --> 06:29.855
But most importantly,

06:30.022 --> 06:31.357
I'm looking for good technique

06:31.524 --> 06:33.859
in your application and your paint.

06:34.026 --> 06:37.563
You have two hours,
and your time starts now.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.535
Megan: I grab the balloons.

06:42.702 --> 06:46.105
I know nobody's going to
grab the balloons.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.174
Tate: I saw these awesome flowers.

06:48.341 --> 06:51.043
I'm going to glue them
to the head as horns.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.579
I'm Sam, and I'm currently
living in Decatur, Georgia.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.415
I have a lot
of classic arts training,

06:55.815 --> 06:59.285
but I'm here to challenge my skills.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.653
Get going with this.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.188
Marcel: My name is Marcel

07:02.355 --> 07:03.723
and I saw my first horror film
when I was four years old.

07:03.890 --> 07:04.924
My parents explained to me,

07:05.174 --> 07:06.050
"That's makeup, that's an actor."

07:06.526 --> 07:09.376
And I was like,
"That would be so cool to do."

07:10.563 --> 07:12.098
What the hell is this?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.332
Anthony: The first thing I did
was I opened up my box

07:13.724 --> 07:14.233
and I started ripping through it.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.501
All right, brush kit.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.536
I recognized 90%
of the stuff in there.

07:17.703 --> 07:18.646
I was thanking God.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.648
Jo: It's extremely intimidating.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.174
You almost have to be a chemist

07:22.341 --> 07:23.609
for most of this stuff
that we're using.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.278
Frank: It was really hard

07:25.445 --> 07:26.979
to even come up with something.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.181
But I saw these peacock feathers
that looked like eyes

07:29.348 --> 07:31.409
and I tried to make something
that was a bit sensible.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.721
Conor: There were pre-made
prosthetic pieces in the kit,

07:35.888 --> 07:37.832
and I found this leopard nose.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.417
And I was like, "This is perfect."

07:39.792 --> 07:43.696
So you're going to be
a reptilian creature.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.382
I'm gluing heavy pineapple
leaves onto a guy's face.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.634
I grab the Pros-Aide.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.804
It's a contact cement
that can hold foam on real well.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.806
I figure a happier zombie
to show my personality.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.808
So I'm going to make teeth
out of cauliflower.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.712
Jessica: I'm Jessica Kramer
from Scottdale, Pennsylvania.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.580
I know I already beat out
a bunch of people to get here

08:01.939 --> 08:03.816
and people would die
to be in my spot, so...

08:03.983 --> 08:05.276
I know it's going to be tough.
It's going to be very tough.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.361
You have one hour left.

08:11.557 --> 08:13.993
How you guys doing?
I'm just about done.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.928
Frank: Just by me being a big mouth,

08:16.095 --> 08:17.413
I think that throws
a couple people off their game.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.666
You guys can take your time
on the rest of that hour.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.302
"I'm almost done!" I'm almost done!"

08:23.469 --> 08:24.295
Shut up, Frank.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.339
Anthony: This guy
puts on a prosthetic

08:26.506 --> 08:27.590
and puts some brown makeup on it

08:28.007 --> 08:29.092
and sat down and started eating.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.409
Wow, this guy,
he's really full of...

08:37.917 --> 08:39.251
I knew that a lot of people

08:39.418 --> 08:40.586
we're going to go for horror.

08:40.753 --> 08:43.272
I wanted to do something
a little more artistic.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.566
You never quite know
how it's going to turn out.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.527
If something doesn't work,
find another creative way of doing it

08:48.694 --> 08:49.946
and it looks better
than what you've already thought of.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.965
Tate: With about 45 minutes left

08:53.132 --> 08:54.867
I had to abandon the horn idea

08:55.034 --> 08:56.494
because they started to do this.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.414
These things were literally
secreting juice.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.666
I'm not a botanist.
I don't know this stuff.

09:07.847 --> 09:08.923
Your time is up.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.510
I'm completely unhappy.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.987
- Hey, Tate.
- Hey, what's going on?

09:15.154 --> 09:16.639
You want to tell us
a little bit about what you did here?

09:17.023 --> 09:19.425
Tate: I didn't get to do
exactly what I wanted,

09:19.592 --> 09:21.861
but I think that I pulled
a decent character together.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.829
You do, huh?

09:23.996 --> 09:24.730
Well, I guess that's your call.

09:24.980 --> 09:25.940
How about the color?

09:26.332 --> 09:27.733
I didn't have a chance
to go in and powder.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.110
I'm happy with my edges.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.902
All right.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.039
Thank you.

09:34.206 --> 09:35.674
Gage: I was expecting the worst.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.285
I literally put up my shield
and was like,

09:37.577 --> 09:40.446
"All right, let's hear it."

09:40.788 --> 09:43.349
My whole idea was as if
he was going to pick up his prom date

09:43.516 --> 09:45.710
and she took his flowers
and smashed them up through his face.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.120
But I also wanted to have
a little bit of symmetry.

09:48.287 --> 09:51.215
I wanted it to be a little bit more
interesting than just mush on his face.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.428
I actually really like this, a lot.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.129
What excites me
about what you're saying

09:57.513 --> 09:59.131
is that the symmetry is on purpose.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.309
Fundamentally, it's very well done.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.643
Thank you.

10:03.035 --> 10:04.236
Marcel: I don't care
how confident you are,

10:04.403 --> 10:06.939
if someone of that caliber
is up in your work,

10:07.106 --> 10:08.641
you're going to be nervous.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.943
I was trying to incorporate
the hotel into this makeup.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.155
She came here on a date,
got turned down,

10:14.447 --> 10:15.656
and she had revenge.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.565
I think David Bowie
is going to love it.

10:19.852 --> 10:23.372
You've got the idea.
I don't think that comes across.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.890
Anthony: I'm watching Glenn,

10:25.057 --> 10:26.091
and as he's going through the line

10:26.258 --> 10:28.994
he's literally picking
[bleep] apart.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.796
I'm like, "Dude,
we have flowers and two hours."

10:31.130 --> 10:32.565
I mean, come on!

10:32.732 --> 10:33.674
My roommate believes
that aliens live among us,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.968
so this is one of them.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.285
And it took me about an hour.

10:39.505 --> 10:40.932
Glenn: I wish you would've broken
the color up more, though,

10:41.340 --> 10:43.768
especially when you're telling me
it only took you an hour

10:44.076 --> 10:45.144
and you're happy about that.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.312
Okay.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.080
I'm disappointed you didn't utilize

10:48.481 --> 10:49.857
all the time that you had
at your disposal.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.982
Everyone else clearly did.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.587
Thank you.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.948
Anthony: I was elated
when Frank got called on it.

10:57.289 --> 10:58.199
Bit him right in the ass.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.626
I incorporated a couple aspects

11:00.793 --> 11:01.619
of some different reptiles.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.563
And, of course, a chameleon eye.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.749
I'm impressed. You clearly knew
where it was going.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.801
- Very cool.
- Thank you.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.370
You could do anything.
You could do pretty, you could do ugly.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.539
You could do scary,
you do a monster.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.941
This foundation challenge
has big stakes.

11:16.108 --> 11:17.109
You get immunity if you win,

11:17.276 --> 11:18.844
so of course I want to win.

11:20.646 --> 11:22.715
So, Glenn, the winner is?

11:22.882 --> 11:24.750
Glenn: This is a tough decision.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.886
It came down between Gage...

11:27.053 --> 11:29.021
great eye, really nice balance...

11:29.355 --> 11:31.056
and Tom.

11:31.223 --> 11:34.652
You had the most creative use
of the materials.

11:34.994 --> 11:35.903
The winner is...

11:41.133 --> 11:43.244
This is a tough decision,

11:43.636 --> 11:49.174
but it came down between
Gage and Tom.

11:49.341 --> 11:50.409
Frank: Tom ended up hiring Gage

11:50.576 --> 11:51.844
for his first couple of jobs,

11:52.011 --> 11:52.670
so it's really interesting

11:53.079 --> 11:54.346
to see them pit against each other.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.015
Tom: I really want the immunity.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.517
The last times I saw Gage's work

11:58.684 --> 12:00.636
I think I could have
wiped the floor with him.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.889
The winner is...

12:04.223 --> 12:05.099
Gage.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.526
Okay.

12:07.693 --> 12:08.477
Gage: The moment of relief,

12:08.861 --> 12:10.763
I don't know if it came
across on my face.

12:10.930 --> 12:11.731
I was pretty dumb-founded.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.232
Congratulations, Gage.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.192
You have won immunity,

12:15.442 --> 12:18.137
and you are safe from
elimination this week.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.040
Gage: Tom and I, we're just getting
to know each other again.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.975
I don't want to start
the whole thing off on the wrong foot

12:23.142 --> 12:25.411
by being like,
"Okay, I won over you."

12:25.778 --> 12:26.996
All right, guys, that's it for now.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.664
Go check out your new loft,

12:29.048 --> 12:31.584
and we will be seeing
all of you tomorrow.

12:42.228 --> 12:43.262
Frank: Getting into these lofts
was really fun.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.680
They're really cool spaces.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.557
I'm kind of looking forward

12:46.966 --> 12:48.309
to interacting with everybody
on a daily basis.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.004
I just started jumping
on beds and on couches

12:52.171 --> 12:53.672
just to drive Megan a little nuts.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.400
This is a nice place, Frank!

12:56.742 --> 12:59.011
Sam: I'm excited and nervous

12:59.178 --> 13:01.530
and really unsure of what to expect.

13:11.223 --> 13:14.493
Tate: I'm really tired,
but I'm also really excited.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.670
I can't wait to see
what this lab is all about.

13:16.996 --> 13:17.630
I'm out!

13:24.537 --> 13:25.771
As soon as I walk into the lab,

13:25.938 --> 13:27.681
it's literally Christmas.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.110
I see the workspaces are great.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.544
I see a woodshop,

13:32.711 --> 13:35.581
I see ridiculous
amounts of materials...

13:35.748 --> 13:39.118
all of the things that me
as an independent artist

13:39.285 --> 13:40.861
don't have any access to.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.949
Welcome to your new workplace.

13:45.324 --> 13:49.128
Let's talk about your first
Spotlight Challenge.

13:49.295 --> 13:53.749
You're going to have to create
a half-human half-animal hybrid.

13:55.701 --> 13:58.671
But before I tell you anything else,

13:58.838 --> 14:02.633
I'd like to give you a little bit
of inspiration for your creations.

14:02.908 --> 14:03.884
First...

14:07.046 --> 14:09.557
We've got a black beetle.

14:09.882 --> 14:12.309
Beetles. That's gross.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.520
Your next animal is...

14:18.824 --> 14:20.359
[gasping]

14:21.961 --> 14:22.820
... an ostrich.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.130
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.132
Sergio: I've never really seen
as ostrich up close.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.168
They told us to stay
three feet away and just look

14:29.335 --> 14:30.369
because he'd poke your eyes out.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.104
I have one more little
surprise for you.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.751
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

14:37.042 --> 14:38.477
Oh, my God!

14:38.644 --> 14:39.670
Anthony: They open up the gates
to the place

14:39.979 --> 14:41.130
and Dumbo walks in.

14:41.513 --> 14:42.965
- Wow!
- Wow.

14:43.349 --> 14:44.717
My hair stood up on my neck.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.385
I was like, "A freaking
elephant in the building?"

14:46.685 --> 14:48.921
This, everybody, is Susie.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.139
Say hello to Susie.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.270
You will be paired up
in teams of two.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.430
Your teams were drawn randomly.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.599
Each team will need
to choose an animal

15:00.766 --> 15:03.068
to incorporate into your creations.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.839
There are three animals
and two teams will use each one.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.441
When it's your turn,
you will also need to select a model,

15:09.608 --> 15:11.677
which you will be doing by selecting

15:11.844 --> 15:14.694
one of the casts
of their heads off the shelf.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.648
Jessica, Jo.

15:16.815 --> 15:20.152
Jo is very young,
and it terrifies me.

15:20.319 --> 15:21.453
It's going to be a scary challenge.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.455
I say if we do the ostrich,
we get a girl.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.132
I say if we do an elephant,
we do a male.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.383
I think the beetle is a no go.

15:26.725 --> 15:27.801
Jessica: I was thinking ostrich.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.628
Let's do her.

15:29.795 --> 15:31.463
Jessica: We decided to pick
Diana's life cast,

15:31.630 --> 15:35.200
which is the exact
replica of her face, but in stone.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.302
That's what we make
all our molds off of.

15:37.469 --> 15:38.854
So if I wanted to have a beak,

15:39.271 --> 15:40.523
I'd sculpt the beak on it
out of clay.

15:40.806 --> 15:42.708
Sergio, Gage.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.444
When she said it was Serge,
I had seen Serge's makeup.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.213
My personal opinion of it
was that it was cool.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.074
- I'd be up for the elephant...
- Okay, cool.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.659
He has a nice full face.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.152
That's the first one I looked at.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.520
- Cool with that one?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.554
Go ahead and grab it.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.322
[thunks twice]

15:57.489 --> 15:58.390
- Crack.
- Sweet.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.527
Let's go with the ostrich.
Joy. Okay.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.671
Wonderful.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.214
All right, elephant.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.566
Maybe Jayson.
He's bigger.

16:07.733 --> 16:08.733
Okay.

16:12.004 --> 16:12.972
Beetle.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.976
Which one do you want?

16:17.309 --> 16:20.646
We get the tiniest
head in the bunch.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.940
You will have have three days
for this challenge.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.217
The judges will be
looking at your technique,

16:25.609 --> 16:26.944
creativity, execution,

16:27.194 --> 16:29.029
and your overall presentation.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.573
Is everybody ready?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.158
- Yes.
- Go ahead!

16:33.459 --> 16:34.201
Come here, baby. Stay.

16:34.526 --> 16:35.327
Oh, you!

16:35.627 --> 16:37.362
Be careful.

16:37.704 --> 16:38.664
Anthony: So I'm sketching it up

16:38.831 --> 16:39.540
and asking the handler
a million questions.

16:39.932 --> 16:40.749
Do they have teeth?
What's inside?

16:41.100 --> 16:42.084
Is it basically just all beak?

16:42.501 --> 16:43.627
Does it run,
does it fly, does it spit?

16:43.969 --> 16:44.970
Anything I could think of

16:45.137 --> 16:46.422
to help me incorporate
into my design.

16:46.705 --> 16:47.840
It's almost like a triangle.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.041
Do we have a soldering gun?

16:49.208 --> 16:50.342
Yeah. It's one of these things.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.543
Oh, sweet. Perfect.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.711
We came up with this concept

16:52.878 --> 16:55.214
of a 1950s mad scientist

16:55.381 --> 16:57.049
that turns into an insect.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.268
My idea was to make bug arms.

16:59.726 --> 17:01.820
Marcel: Okay, everyone hold still.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.689
Our concept is a giant beetle man

17:04.022 --> 17:04.772
dressed as an exterminator.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.191
It has to be...

17:06.692 --> 17:07.226
It shouldn't be just
a very large beetle.

17:07.393 --> 17:08.594
It should remind you of a humanoid.

17:08.761 --> 17:09.904
So I'm going to sketch out mine.

17:10.319 --> 17:10.896
You do whatever you want,
and then we'll mix and match.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.030
Sure enough.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.115
I want to elongate the neck here.

17:13.499 --> 17:14.241
I was thinking about that, too.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.335
I want to make the neck
as long as possible.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.787
Megan: We're like,
"Why not make this ostrich

17:19.238 --> 17:20.580
into a sophisticated women?"

17:20.939 --> 17:21.624
Dude, you got me.

17:21.906 --> 17:22.915
We're on the page, right?

17:23.275 --> 17:26.511
I was thinking I want
to do it Vegas showgirl,

17:26.678 --> 17:28.614
so it's like really high fashion.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.817
Jo: The direction that we did
decide to go in was high fashion.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.219
It's something I don't
do normally... ever.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.421
I want a lot of volume.

17:36.588 --> 17:41.185
The first thing that comes to my mind
is leaving parts of human.

17:41.493 --> 17:42.361
A hybrid.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.270
Human hybrid.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.105
Human elephant man.

17:45.355 --> 17:45.939
Elephant man.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.367
Let's do it.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.303
Tom: Working with Conor
is an interesting predicament

17:51.470 --> 17:52.655
because we're both alpha males.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.156
Right there.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.701
We're just not on
the same page with this.

17:57.976 --> 17:59.912
That's what I would do.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.046
I'm not trying to call the shots.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.114
No, no, no, no.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.315
I'm going to put
my own flavor on it,

18:03.482 --> 18:04.166
but I'll stay within that size.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.293
Tell you what.
Use your discretion.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.120
Anthony: Two and a half hours in,

18:08.287 --> 18:09.521
I look over at the other ostrich,

18:09.688 --> 18:11.990
they got a full-blown beak
going up off the cast.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.301
I'm like, "Holy [bleep],
that looks like a duck."

18:14.660 --> 18:16.220
You're doing a skeleton.
It's not a skeleton.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.497
But, I mean, do what you will.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.599
First day in working with Jessica,

18:20.766 --> 18:21.767
I already know
this is going downhill.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.269
Let me go and try and find Sculpey.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.672
Conor: Tom's idea was to make
something that looked like

18:26.980 --> 18:28.073
it was maybe created in a lab.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.709
Tom: I noticed theirs' from
across the way now

18:30.876 --> 18:33.245
and they're doing
a very, very, very similar take

18:33.412 --> 18:34.313
on what we're doing.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.747
Once we started getting into it,

18:35.914 --> 18:37.516
we realized our competition

18:37.683 --> 18:41.019
were doing almost exactly
what we were planning.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.688
- Gotcha.
- What's up, Conor?

18:42.855 --> 18:45.749
You guys are doing the same thing
we were going to do.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.794
We're already technically
behind everybody.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.594
Yeah.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.258
We were going to have
to start from scratch.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.405
Sergio: What's up, Conor?

19:00.572 --> 19:01.640
You guys are doing the same thing
we were going to do.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.683
Oh.

19:04.209 --> 19:07.688
Conor: Gage and Sergio were doing
almost exactly what we were planning.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.948
So we decided to switch gears

19:10.115 --> 19:11.717
and go back to my original idea.

19:11.884 --> 19:16.088
So change direction
back to genetic mutation?

19:16.255 --> 19:18.615
No, we go back to an evolutionary...

19:18.957 --> 19:20.325
That's what I mean.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.368
Tom: Conor wanted to be the boss.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.828
I deferred to that.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.196
All right.

19:24.363 --> 19:25.430
We have four hours today,

19:25.597 --> 19:27.399
nine hours tomorrow of shop work.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.469
Is we spent our 13 hours
butting heads,

19:30.636 --> 19:33.686
I know that we're not
going to finish our project.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.012
Megan: I started looking
around the room.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.477
I start getting
a little intimidated.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.261
Megan just takes her hands,
grabs the beak,

19:56.428 --> 19:58.930
and rips it right off
the freaking sculpture.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.133
I was like, "Okay, I guess we're
starting over then."

20:01.300 --> 20:04.903
The eyes... If we made
big, big ostrich eyes.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.706
Yeah, and not Donald Duck.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.141
Not Donald Duck.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.002
Sometimes at the last minute
you got to change up the game.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.593
Jo: Why don't we do
the feet out of Sculpey?

20:19.985 --> 20:21.420
I can sculpt feet.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.087
Uh...

20:23.956 --> 20:25.590
um, we only have
a certain amount of time.

20:25.757 --> 20:26.658
Yes.

20:26.825 --> 20:27.592
Let's get done what we can get done.

20:27.759 --> 20:28.693
All right.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.095
All right, that's time, guys.

20:30.262 --> 20:31.862
Let's get out of here.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.433
- Let's go, man.
- Whoo!

20:34.600 --> 20:35.600
Word.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.208
Jo: So, day two,
we get back to the lab.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.476
At this point
we have to really pull it out.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.378
The sculpture
is slowly coming together.

20:46.787 --> 20:47.788
The face is ready to mold.

20:53.218 --> 20:54.986
Marcel: I sculpted the face
as much as I could,

20:55.153 --> 20:57.322
and then in about an hour
I go, "Let's trade."

20:57.489 --> 21:00.192
So she added her touches
while I was sculpting arms.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.127
I'm headed, like, blam!

21:02.294 --> 21:04.763
Put it up.
Power, heat.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.898
I showed Tate how to use
the vacuform machine.

21:07.065 --> 21:08.500
What it is is a big frame

21:08.667 --> 21:09.801
and you put a piece
of plastic in there

21:09.968 --> 21:11.069
and then it has heating elements

21:11.236 --> 21:13.036
that heat that plastic up.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.442
You pull it down
and suction it over a form

21:17.609 --> 21:20.070
to make, in our case,
a plate to mount some antennas.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.680
Sweet, man.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.215
Tate: Me and Frank are jamming.

21:23.382 --> 21:24.850
I love the guy.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.084
He's talented, he's quick,
he knows his [bleep],

21:26.251 --> 21:27.319
and I think that the judges

21:27.486 --> 21:28.829
will honestly get a kick
out of what we do.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.998
That's it.

21:33.525 --> 21:35.878
Making molds takes a long time.

21:36.261 --> 21:37.629
On a stone you can replicate

21:37.796 --> 21:39.047
whatever kind of detail
you want with clay.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.967
The place where the clay is

21:42.134 --> 21:43.969
will eventually become foam latex,

21:44.136 --> 21:45.637
which is what the actor will wear.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.873
Some of these materials,
waiting for them to set up

21:48.040 --> 21:49.874
can take awhile.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.913
- How's it going, Frank?
- Just great.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.783
I'm definitely noticing
Gage is working his ass off

21:58.950 --> 22:01.419
and Sergio seems to be
at a snail's pace.

22:01.586 --> 22:02.988
How are you and Sergio doing?

22:03.155 --> 22:06.758
Well, he's finally molding the face.

22:06.925 --> 22:07.993
Just now?
He just started?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.961
Yeah, but there's still
so much to do.

22:10.128 --> 22:15.400
Knowing that I have immunity
is a double-edged sword

22:15.567 --> 22:16.919
because I really want to bring it.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.837
I want Serge to shine

22:19.004 --> 22:21.139
and I really don't want
to hinder him in any way.

22:21.306 --> 22:24.309
I'm not the person
to screw someone over.

22:24.476 --> 22:25.744
The splash coat's drying.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.045
You should get a lot of the detail.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.097
I realize that Serge
like to take his time.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.883
I pulled super double duty.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.518
I was trying to keep Serge on task,

22:33.685 --> 22:36.835
trying to keep him sculpting,
but at a quicker pace.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.059
- That would be cool.
- Yeah.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.637
Marcel: Sam and I have
our sculpture done.

22:52.804 --> 22:54.289
We have everything we need set up

22:54.539 --> 22:57.623
and we feel really comfortable
with what we've done.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.814
Frank: When I look around
at everybody else's work,

23:02.981 --> 23:05.083
I have no doubt in my mind
that Tate and I

23:05.250 --> 23:08.153
are going to be one of the top teams
in this challenge...

23:08.320 --> 23:10.305
- Oh, that's so good.
- Right?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.591
... if not the winner.

23:12.758 --> 23:15.560
And then we saw Conor's sculpture
and it was beautiful,

23:15.727 --> 23:16.603
so we knew we had some competition.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.939
Yours looks good.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.151
Jessica: They're perfect.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.036
That's the exact color
I want to use.

23:25.203 --> 23:26.338
Jo: I don't want to be
on the chopping block

23:26.505 --> 23:27.906
because I go with
someone else's idea.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.507
I need to be more assertive,

23:29.674 --> 23:31.509
but instead of stressing her out

23:31.676 --> 23:33.378
over trying to change something,

23:33.545 --> 23:34.879
we're going to continue
on what we're doing

23:35.046 --> 23:36.646
and hope for the best.

23:38.316 --> 23:41.286
Gage: I look at the foot
and it's set rock hard.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.380
It's supposed to be soft
and it's set like stone.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.790
We didn't get the mix right.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.359
I know right away
that we can't use it.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.026
We have to scrap the foot.

23:50.695 --> 23:51.863
Sergio: I'm very nervous

23:52.030 --> 23:53.181
about presenting
our creation to the judges.

23:53.598 --> 23:54.891
Since Gage has immunity,

23:55.300 --> 23:57.369
if our makeup doesn't succeed,

23:57.536 --> 23:59.730
I'm the one on the chopping block.

24:01.606 --> 24:01.690
<i>McKenzie: Coming up...</i>

24:02.073 --> 24:02.941
Gage: Our models walk in.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.577
There was just no time.
I'm freaking out.

24:05.744 --> 24:08.244
Nobody wants to be
the first one to go.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.182
Really well done.

24:11.349 --> 24:13.577
Please make me understand
whose idea this was.

24:20.525 --> 24:21.860
Sergio: It's the morning
of Elimination

24:22.027 --> 24:23.728
and we're very behind.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.430
I'm not happy with these edges.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.499
This is going to be
hard to blend out.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.833
Sergio: We've hit some snags.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.702
The leg piece that
we were working on

24:30.869 --> 24:32.103
didn't set up right.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.171
I think it's going to be horrible

24:33.338 --> 24:34.606
because we really needed that

24:34.773 --> 24:36.173
to balance the whole thing out.

24:38.844 --> 24:39.811
Gage: Our models walk in

24:39.978 --> 24:41.546
to start our application process.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.114
Sergio.
Nice to meet you.

24:43.281 --> 24:45.917
I was really hoping
to be much further along.

24:46.084 --> 24:47.184
Are you excited?

24:50.155 --> 24:51.623
Tate: Just stand right here.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.617
I want to see how well
these fit you.

24:54.025 --> 24:54.859
The bug arms are done.

24:55.026 --> 24:56.127
Just push...

24:56.294 --> 24:58.096
I slide them on her.
They fit perfect.

24:58.263 --> 25:00.565
Frank, check it out.
We've got articulation.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.300
- Oh, excellent.
- Nice.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.469
Do me a favor.
Just lift your neck for a second.

25:04.636 --> 25:05.837
Anthony: We took
the foam latex prosthetic,

25:06.004 --> 25:07.305
fit it on her.

25:07.472 --> 25:08.873
It fit beautifully.
The neck looked fantastic.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.810
Great, now your character

25:11.977 --> 25:15.764
is supposed to be a poet
in the 18th century in London.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.248
Okay.

25:17.415 --> 25:18.983
And you write your own tales
about yourself

25:19.150 --> 25:20.819
and that's where
fairy tales come from.

25:21.227 --> 25:22.287
There were a couple times
I'm looking at Megan

25:22.454 --> 25:24.055
and I'm just not getting
what she was digging.

25:24.222 --> 25:26.391
Your hands are together like this

25:26.558 --> 25:28.093
and it looks like mittens.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.595
And you walk like you're
a sophisticated woman,

25:30.762 --> 25:33.831
but you are
an ostrich as well, so...

25:35.333 --> 25:36.501
She starts doing the thing

25:36.668 --> 25:37.669
with the prance and stuff like that.

25:37.836 --> 25:38.903
I'm thinking maybe she did runway.

25:39.070 --> 25:43.608
Then when you stop,
open up your arms.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.276
There you go.
Wonderful.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.412
Then what I'm going to do
is give you a pen

25:47.579 --> 25:50.548
and then you just take that pen out
and get the book out.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.184
You sign.
There you go. That's it.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.456
First one to put the mask on.

26:05.864 --> 26:07.632
- Put the horns up.
- Yeah.

26:07.799 --> 26:08.867
When you have a bald cap on there,

26:09.034 --> 26:09.901
you want it to be tight.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.968
You can go ahead and let go.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.071
[sighs]

26:16.491 --> 26:18.608
Well, I end up pulling it too tight.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.979
So we got a problem, Jessica.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.480
I got a rip in my bald cap.

26:22.647 --> 26:25.083
- Real bad?
- Pretty bad.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.084
Jessica: That really bothers me.

26:26.484 --> 26:28.084
I should have done it.

26:29.654 --> 26:32.056
That's a half hour, guys.
You got 30 minutes to do this.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.929
Do you guys have the super glue?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.664
Thank you.

26:39.831 --> 26:40.932
Cut the strap, cut the strap.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.749
No, no, no.
We got it.

26:44.469 --> 26:46.805
I think we should spend
the rest of this packing.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.840
All right.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.401
Found it.
It was all the way in the back.

26:51.843 --> 26:53.778
And that's time!

26:53.945 --> 26:55.113
Jessica: We pack up our kits

26:55.280 --> 26:57.949
and we head over
to the stage for Last Looks.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.123
We have one more hour
to do touch-ups.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.458
Oops, she has a bald spot.

27:06.858 --> 27:09.027
Yeah, I'm re-darting.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.795
Jo: I am stressing.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.631
Jessica is on my case
about this hole in the bald cap.

27:14.048 --> 27:15.967
I'm trying to figure out
anything I can do to fix it.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.036
It's going to be messy,
so we'll see how it goes.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.537
Megan: You got the clips?

27:19.704 --> 27:20.905
Hey, everybody, I think we found

27:21.072 --> 27:23.074
our new challenger over here.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.243
Megan and Anthony's
is looking really great.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.980
And Sergio and Gage's
is looking worse and worse.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.748
Nobody wants to be
the first one to go.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.250
There's still a lot of places
to prove yourself.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.986
I'm going to blow
into your fake eyeball.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.254
Gage: There was just no time

27:36.421 --> 27:37.555
and he still doesn't have hair def.

27:37.722 --> 27:38.857
I'm freaking out.

27:39.024 --> 27:39.824
You know what else
we could do real quick?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.226
We can use the bandanna.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.560
It's not looking
very good for us now.

27:42.727 --> 27:44.261
Hey, guys, we got 15 minutes left.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.333
[muttering]

27:48.500 --> 27:50.101
Don't worry.
Let's get the arms on

27:50.268 --> 27:51.753
and then you won't feel anything.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.104
Tom: As I'm painting these hands

27:53.271 --> 27:55.373
and trying to put my spin on things,

27:55.540 --> 27:57.675
my own partner is kind of covering up
what I'm doing

27:57.842 --> 27:59.110
as I'm doing it.

27:59.277 --> 28:00.879
Conor: Try something other
than a paintbrush.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.214
So now we're down
to six minutes and he's putting dirt

28:03.381 --> 28:05.550
over everything
I keep cleaning off and painting.

28:05.717 --> 28:06.951
Tom: I don't want too much dust

28:07.118 --> 28:09.053
because I'm afraid it looks
like we're covering

28:09.220 --> 28:10.889
everything I'm doing with dust.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.725
I need to show what
I'm doing here as well.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.560
And he's like, "Elephants are dirty.
What do you expect?"

28:15.727 --> 28:18.196
And I'm like, "Well, your face
isn't covered with dirt."

28:18.596 --> 28:19.531
Is there anything else?

28:19.698 --> 28:20.965
We're just panicked.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.166
We're like, "What if
they don't like it?

28:22.333 --> 28:23.968
What if they see
something we don't?"

28:24.135 --> 28:26.237
It is one nightmare after another.

28:26.404 --> 28:29.274
I've got to say, I've never made
a costume like this before.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.808
I know the hair thing
doesn't make sense right now,

28:30.975 --> 28:32.110
but it will.

28:32.277 --> 28:34.462
Brushes down...
our makeup looks like crap.

28:50.595 --> 28:53.130
Welcome to the "Face Off"
reveal stage.

28:55.533 --> 28:59.771
Tonight, one of you will be
eliminated.

28:59.938 --> 29:03.808
Our judges, owner of Optic Nerve
makeup effects studio,

29:03.975 --> 29:05.343
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hey, guys.

29:05.510 --> 29:09.113
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.448
- Hi.
- Hi, Ve.

29:10.615 --> 29:11.950
Gage: Talk about pressure.

29:12.117 --> 29:13.818
I'm very familiar with Ve's work.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.378
I have Beetlejuice,
a character that she helped create,

29:15.787 --> 29:17.322
tattooed on my arm.

29:17.489 --> 29:21.225
And creature designer
and director Patrick Tatopoulus.

29:21.392 --> 29:23.595
- Hello, guys.
- Hey, Patrick.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.597
Tate: Patrick is
one of the most talented in Hollywood

29:25.764 --> 29:27.665
because he kind of
transcends that barrier

29:27.832 --> 29:29.534
of effects artist
and production design.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.369
Your Spotlight Challenge this week

29:31.536 --> 29:33.738
was to create a human-animal hybrid

29:33.905 --> 29:36.240
and we cannot wait to see
what you have created.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.567
Let's get started.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.892
Sergio: We had
an unfinished product.

29:55.059 --> 29:57.328
There was no leg
to balance out the design.

29:57.495 --> 29:58.830
I don't want to be sent home

29:58.997 --> 30:02.092
on something that's not truly mine.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.347
Sam: It's great
to see the piece done,

30:16.514 --> 30:18.282
but I'm feeling
a little bit nervous.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.584
I have no idea what to expect.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.960
Anthony: Joy comes out
and opened her arms

30:29.127 --> 30:30.537
just like Megan wanted her to.

30:41.539 --> 30:42.807
I look over at Ve Neill,

30:42.974 --> 30:44.308
and she's nothing but smiles.

30:54.419 --> 30:56.654
Jo: My nerves were so on edge.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.990
I felt like vomiting
all over the stage.

30:59.399 --> 31:02.107
At this point I'm thinking
I'm going to go home.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.772
Frank: I'm really confident in
how our creature turned out.

31:14.939 --> 31:16.007
I'm not really nervous at all.

31:16.174 --> 31:18.342
So it's just up to the judges.

31:29.854 --> 31:31.723
Conor: I'm pretty critical
about my own work,

31:31.890 --> 31:33.591
but I'm feeling pretty good.

31:33.758 --> 31:35.126
I think we did the best we could

31:35.393 --> 31:38.293
and I think we really
got a shot at winning this.

31:44.802 --> 31:47.037
Judges, if you would like
to take a closer look.

31:48.873 --> 31:50.341
Jo: So, of course.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.494
Why would I think that they would look
at this thing from afar?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.412
They got to come up close.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.414
We have edges, intricate paint

31:56.581 --> 31:58.182
that they're going to
have to look out.

31:58.349 --> 32:01.849
And they are going to rip me
to shreds in front of America.

32:05.056 --> 32:08.960
Judges, if you would like
to take a closer look.

32:09.127 --> 32:12.163
Jo: Of course, why would I think that
they would look at this thing from afar?

32:12.330 --> 32:14.080
They gotta come up close.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.701
Can you turn?

32:22.807 --> 32:24.776
Ve: I didn't realize he had
something on his hands'til just now.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.711
Marcel: They went
into extreme detail,

32:26.878 --> 32:28.379
Ve was running her hands on seams.

32:28.546 --> 32:29.914
And we're all, oh, wow,

32:30.081 --> 32:31.048
they're not joking.

32:31.215 --> 32:33.450
Could you open your mouth a bit?

32:37.922 --> 32:39.690
Jessica: I'm, like, please
don't turn around,

32:39.857 --> 32:41.358
'cause you could see the bald cap.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.962
Can you just turn
your face to the side?

32:45.129 --> 32:46.097
Jessica: Ah, don't look at that.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.266
Look somewhere else.

32:48.433 --> 32:49.866
Hmm. Yeah.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.536
Move your hand.

32:56.107 --> 32:57.742
Ve: Let's see your hands.

32:57.909 --> 33:01.245
Conor: The judges got to see
how well the prosthetic moved,

33:01.412 --> 33:03.981
how well the wrinkling
actually helped sell the movement.

33:04.148 --> 33:07.748
There's things we're just not
gonna be able to get away with.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.571
Well, the judges have
scored your creations,

33:14.993 --> 33:17.995
Megan and Anthony,

33:18.162 --> 33:21.062
Sam, Marcel,

33:21.532 --> 33:22.833
you're both safe.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.037
Would you please
head back to the makeup room.

33:37.557 --> 33:42.053
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.621
Now, the judges would
like to take a moment

33:43.788 --> 33:46.891
to speak to each one of you
about your work.

33:47.058 --> 33:49.426
Frank and Tate,
would you please step up.

33:53.906 --> 33:56.448
You two seem pretty proud
of yourselves.

33:59.937 --> 34:01.906
You should be.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.207
Really like this a lot.

34:03.608 --> 34:04.809
And it looks like a lot of work

34:04.976 --> 34:07.078
in the time that you had to do it.

34:07.245 --> 34:09.112
My one complaint with this is that

34:09.280 --> 34:12.917
the construction
looks a little Darth Vader-y.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.685
Other than that,
I think it's really cool.

34:14.851 --> 34:17.188
And it looks like you used
a bunch of different materials

34:17.355 --> 34:19.422
and stuck to an idea, so well done.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.859
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

34:22.025 --> 34:23.661
It came out really great
and I like the way that

34:23.828 --> 34:25.429
everything is all tied in.

34:25.596 --> 34:28.165
I'm kind of there with Glenn
about the Darth Vader helmet,

34:28.331 --> 34:29.800
but very nicely done, guys.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.069
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.337
I like your background.

34:33.504 --> 34:34.804
The background tells
me you worked in

34:34.972 --> 34:37.174
the direction of
a '50s looking movie,

34:37.341 --> 34:38.784
and when I got truly close to it

34:39.143 --> 34:41.112
I forgot the person behind the mask

34:41.279 --> 34:42.947
and to me, that's the
most important thing.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.547
So I'm a big fan.
Good job.

34:44.715 --> 34:46.315
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.321
Gage and Sergio, would you please
take center stage.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.529
Where were your
responsibilities here?

34:58.696 --> 35:01.232
I mean, who was
responsible for what?

35:01.399 --> 35:05.069
I did the sculpture
on the face and the little tusk.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.138
I took on the liberty of
sculpting the arm.

35:07.305 --> 35:09.240
The arm basically was designed to be

35:09.407 --> 35:11.375
like it was forming
an elephant trunk.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.044
We wanted to take
the trunk off the face

35:13.211 --> 35:14.545
and bring it down somewhere else.

35:14.712 --> 35:16.114
Except for the actual tusk,

35:16.514 --> 35:17.982
I don't recognize an elephant.

35:18.149 --> 35:19.583
On the conceptual idea, it's great,

35:19.750 --> 35:20.952
you just didn't
exercise it at the end,

35:21.352 --> 35:23.187
and that's a bummer.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.489
Do both of you remember me mention
the difference

35:25.656 --> 35:28.225
between asymmetry and
something being lopsided?

35:28.392 --> 35:29.760
- Yeah.
- Not only did you do it to the face

35:29.927 --> 35:32.029
- But you put the arm
on the same side. Why? - Right.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.066
I thought with the leg,
it would balance him out a little more,

35:35.341 --> 35:36.300
'cause the leg would
have flared out.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.935
And the leg went wrong because...

35:38.102 --> 35:39.971
We ran polyfoam inside of the leg

35:40.138 --> 35:41.272
and is solidified really hard

35:41.439 --> 35:42.773
because it wasn't mixed right.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.476
Guys, it's atrocious.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.244
The hair work is hideous,

35:47.411 --> 35:48.779
the paint job's terrible,

35:48.946 --> 35:51.382
The arm is, I don't even know
what the heck it is.

35:51.732 --> 35:54.518
I can't find anything good
to say about any part of this makeup.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.354
I didn't go with my gut feelings,

35:56.521 --> 35:58.289
and so I think that
I could definitely

35:58.456 --> 36:02.259
hone that and be more
specific to my strong skills.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.161
You should have
implemented that on this makeup

36:04.328 --> 36:06.247
because you knew
going in that he had immunity.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.124
We can't do anything to him.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.999
But we can certainly
do something to you.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.743
Conor, Tom, please
come to the center.

36:23.881 --> 36:24.982
So, guys, I like this.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.350
Thank you.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.853
When I got close
to the makeup, I realized that

36:29.020 --> 36:31.555
this is a pretty thick
animal form on the face.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.090
When I asked him to move his neck,

36:33.566 --> 36:34.859
I was very impressed
the way those all

36:35.026 --> 36:38.154
worked together very well with the
expression of the actor.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.297
And I think that's a big deal.
So good job.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.033
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.902
I agree. How did you break down the
responsibilities here?

36:45.069 --> 36:48.272
I sculpted the face,
but Tom sculpted the ears,

36:48.439 --> 36:52.376
blocked out the nose, finished out
the hands, gave me the trunk.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.412
Every step of this
was a collaboration.

36:54.579 --> 36:55.713
Glenn: Very cool.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.882
You really took
the actual elephant being

36:58.049 --> 36:59.550
and put it on his hands

36:59.717 --> 37:01.852
and I think that's very cool.
Congratulations.

37:02.019 --> 37:04.119
- Thank you very much
- Thanks.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.124
Jessica and Jo, please come forward.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.733
What the duck happened here?

37:17.702 --> 37:21.338
Please make me understand
who's idea this was.

37:21.505 --> 37:22.782
We collaborated, I think.

37:23.107 --> 37:26.786
We wanted to be more
like Vegas showgirl meets an ostrich.

37:27.111 --> 37:31.615
There's lots of things that I dislike
gravely about this makeup,

37:31.782 --> 37:34.485
but the bald cap thing
on the back...

37:34.652 --> 37:37.788
That was my doing.
It was already glued onto the front.

37:37.955 --> 37:41.175
I pulled on the back
and I got a huge tear in the side.

37:41.492 --> 37:43.427
When you guys have
huge problems like that,

37:43.594 --> 37:45.763
stop what you're doing
and take 5 minutes to

37:45.930 --> 37:47.849
problem solve that together.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.635
Silly, silly mistake, 'cause one
of you is possibly gonna hang for it.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.907
I don't know what you guys were
thinking when you did this

37:57.074 --> 38:00.044
but you can never put this on film.
Even for a kids' show.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.979
Well, you would have been
better off taking a swim cap

38:02.146 --> 38:03.948
and gluing feathers on it
as far as I'm concerned.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.918
I wish you had a design
before you started.

38:08.085 --> 38:10.221
It takes some time,
a half an hour, an hour,

38:10.388 --> 38:11.555
but you have a good sense of
where you're going.

38:11.722 --> 38:13.257
And challenge yourself
on the design.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.726
The design is not there,
this is never gonna go anywhere.

38:15.893 --> 38:18.662
Jessica, why do you think you should
stay in the competition?

38:18.829 --> 38:20.598
I think I put a lot of work
into the sculpture.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.533
The painting and
the skirt, you know,

38:22.700 --> 38:24.568
I think I have a lot to offer.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.937
I would rather hear that
you understand what your mistake was.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.906
For you to battle
and defend this piece

38:29.306 --> 38:30.933
is a little more
challenging, I think.

38:32.935 --> 38:33.811
And Jo?

38:34.078 --> 38:35.346
I've a lot of ambition for this.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.215
I have a lot to offer
just learning now that

38:38.382 --> 38:40.351
you have to have and idea,
you have to stick with it,

38:40.518 --> 38:42.695
and you have to go
and that's something that I can do.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.889
Do you realize now
that you made a mistake?

38:45.056 --> 38:48.893
I want to shoot myself in the face
in front of all of you right now.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.060
Okay.

38:54.532 --> 38:57.902
All right, judges, who is
the winner of this challenge?

38:58.069 --> 38:59.837
The two top teams

39:00.004 --> 39:03.240
were Frank and Tate,

39:03.407 --> 39:06.443
and Conor and Tom.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.879
The top team is

39:09.046 --> 39:10.915
Conor and Tom.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.267
But there can only be one winner.

39:13.651 --> 39:16.145
And that person is...

39:16.487 --> 39:18.054
Conor.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.927
Glenn, why did you pick
Conor to be the winner?

39:23.094 --> 39:24.862
We felt out of that top team

39:25.029 --> 39:27.665
Conor's sculpting really
helped to pull that makeup along.

39:27.948 --> 39:28.732
Thank you.

39:28.899 --> 39:30.534
And I was really surprised.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.411
I actually thought we
were gonna win as a team.

39:32.737 --> 39:36.106
In the end, my effort
was the one that stood out.

39:36.273 --> 39:38.375
Conor, there's something
more you should know.

39:39.877 --> 39:43.047
Each week, the winner of
the spotlight challenge

39:43.214 --> 39:45.716
will have a chance to
consult with the judges

39:45.883 --> 39:49.920
as to who they think
should be eliminated.

39:50.087 --> 39:52.256
If the rest of you would please
go wait in the makeup room

39:52.423 --> 39:54.973
until the judges have
made the decision.

40:03.033 --> 40:06.337
Conor, between Jo,
Jessica and Sergio,

40:06.504 --> 40:09.704
who do you think did
the worst job on this challenge?

40:12.276 --> 40:16.380
I'm gonna reluctantly
say Jessica because

40:16.547 --> 40:17.948
she made the choice to sculpt

40:18.115 --> 40:22.753
an upper and lower beak
above the mouth of the performer

40:22.920 --> 40:25.623
and that was just never gonna work.

40:25.790 --> 40:26.824
That's a good point.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.292
Thank you, Conor.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.828
You can head back
to the makeup room.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.529
All right, judges.

40:32.696 --> 40:34.890
It's time to begin your deliberation
on who should be eliminated.

40:35.199 --> 40:36.433
Let's start with Sergio.
What are your thoughts?

40:36.850 --> 40:39.803
He was quite passionate about it

40:39.970 --> 40:41.872
and I really like to hear that.

40:42.039 --> 40:43.741
Ve: And as you said
he does have the passion.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.109
- Yeah.
- And I think he will

40:45.401 --> 40:46.710
make a comeback and
show us something good.

40:46.877 --> 40:48.738
Yeah. I, I disagree.

40:49.046 --> 40:52.383
There's many bad things
to come from Sergio, in my opinion.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.160
All right, what are your
thoughts on Jessica?

40:54.410 --> 40:55.919
I need to feel that they're gonna do

40:56.086 --> 40:57.321
something better next time.

40:57.488 --> 40:59.690
And in her, I felt
she was giving up.

40:59.857 --> 41:02.126
She says 'cause, well, I spent
a lot of time sculpting the feet.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.560
Well, you know what?
The feet aren't on somebody's face

41:03.727 --> 41:05.462
but that goofy bill was.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.631
So she should have completed that

41:07.798 --> 41:10.167
and at least made an
attempt to make it a complete face.

41:10.551 --> 41:14.305
It's a close one.
I mean, I think if Jo sat back

41:14.472 --> 41:16.640
and let it happen,
it's just as much her fault.

41:16.907 --> 41:18.909
- I agree.
- The only thing you can look at to say

41:19.076 --> 41:20.377
which one seems to want to fight

41:20.544 --> 41:22.413
and get to the next level?

41:22.580 --> 41:23.522
McKenzie: All right, judges.

41:23.772 --> 41:25.115
Have you come to a decision?

41:25.282 --> 41:27.482
- I think so.
- I think so, yeah.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.966
So, judges, who's
going home tonight?

41:59.783 --> 42:01.718
So, judges, who's
going home tonight?

42:05.055 --> 42:07.358
Glenn: Gage, you have
immunity this week.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.027
You better make the most
of your second chance.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.095
- Head back to the makeup room.
- Thank you.

42:18.869 --> 42:22.806
Serge. So far, we've seen
two looks from you.

42:22.973 --> 42:24.274
I'm not impressed, and I don't think

42:24.441 --> 42:26.442
the other judges are either.

42:28.412 --> 42:31.048
Jessica, your decision-making skills

42:31.215 --> 42:33.008
have been severely lacking.

42:35.519 --> 42:38.655
And Jo, if you have better skills,

42:38.822 --> 42:41.572
I don't feel like you're
showing them to us.

42:45.362 --> 42:48.131
The person going home tonight is...

42:54.838 --> 42:56.906
it's Jessica.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.077
Well, thank you for the opportunity.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.478
I know tonight I didn't meet up
to your standards.

43:04.448 --> 43:06.817
Jessica, please head
back to the makeup room

43:06.984 --> 43:08.551
- And pack up your kit.
- Thank you.

43:11.547 --> 43:12.956
Jessica: I don't think I should
be going home tonight.

43:13.123 --> 43:14.757
I should have
defended myself harder.

43:18.395 --> 43:19.863
Runs in the family.

43:20.030 --> 43:21.598
Everybody, come on.

43:21.765 --> 43:25.302
I wish I could have given the world
a better chance to see my talent.

43:25.469 --> 43:28.305
But I know in my heart that I'm good
and I'm gonna be out here making movies.

43:28.472 --> 43:29.907
You know, I can do it.
I'm not afraid.

43:30.074 --> 43:31.824
I'll be out here someday.

43:32.305 --> 43:38.483
