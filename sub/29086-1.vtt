28:14.491 --> 28:17.492
about the main character,
Tony, in my story,

28:17.494 --> 28:20.895
is that he is being forced
to rate, to be raised,

28:20.897 --> 28:26.869
and to come to terms
with the incredible struggles

28:26.871 --> 28:29.171

going through at that time,

28:29.173 --> 28:32.874

at school as well.

to make a film

very different from yours.

that really

- No. No.

- No. You should read it.

to you sometimes.

with your
Courtauld connections,

01:36:59.011 --> 01:37:00.611
you might either
know a course

01:37:00.613 --> 01:37:02.580
that would be
an interesting thing

01:37:02.582 --> 01:37:04.348

01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:06.049

in the right direction.

go back to university.

land management,

01:37:47.627 --> 01:37:49.593

now I would do

01:37:49.595 --> 01:37:51.295
something
rather more interesting.

01:37:51.297 --> 01:37:55.566

(STAMMERS) I'd read history.

- WILLIAM: Yeah.

01:37:57.569 --> 01:38:00.604

it isn't about me.

01:38:00.606 --> 01:38:03.674

students that we've got.

01:38:03.676 --> 01:38:05.242

as you say,

that's very exciting.

go to sleep.

yourself. Mmm?

- ROSALIND: Go on.
- No.

01:38:26.065 --> 01:38:28.465

- No. I need to...

- Sleep tight.

01:38:36.542 --> 01:38:40.914
Don't be worthy. Be arrogant.
It's much more sexy.

01:38:42.282 --> 01:38:43.647
Do you like arrogance?

01:38:43.649 --> 01:38:45.215
I think it'll
get you further.

01:38:45.217 --> 01:38:46.384
Because you are arrogant.

01:38:46.386 --> 01:38:48.052
I know I'm arrogant.

01:38:48.054 --> 01:38:49.653

01:38:49.655 --> 01:38:52.055
Yes, all the time.

01:38:52.057 --> 01:38:53.523
It's hard for me to get
through the day without...

01:38:53.525 --> 01:38:54.992
I bet.

01:38:54.994 --> 01:38:57.096
...taking a couple of
moments out and...

01:38:59.298 --> 01:39:02.333
(CHUCKLING) I'm trying
to concentrate on this.

01:39:02.335 --> 01:39:05.436
Don't distract me
with your arrogance

01:39:05.438 --> 01:39:06.771
and sexiness and...

01:39:06.773 --> 01:39:08.238
I'll give it three minutes.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.209
...talking about your...
God knows what.

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.710
- You know what I'm saying.
- I totally...

01:39:12.712 --> 01:39:14.778
You've got some
preconceived idea

01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:17.714
about some Oxbridge version

01:39:17.716 --> 01:39:20.050
of a film director
and it's all bollocks.

01:39:20.052 --> 01:39:21.785
You just need to get out there
and start filming.

01:39:21.787 --> 01:39:23.323
It's like Patrick said.

01:39:25.391 --> 01:39:27.058
Well...

01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.663
I know he's a cunt,
but he's got a point.

01:39:31.264 --> 01:39:33.598
- I liked him.
- No, you didn't.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.768
I didn't, actually.
No, I didn't.

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:39.536
- Um, I liked his wife.
- Did you?

01:39:39.538 --> 01:39:41.442
- Mmm. Very much.
- Mmm.

01:39:42.141 --> 01:39:43.674
Um...

01:39:43.676 --> 01:39:48.780
I feel like I haven't got
this enough, so I need to...

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:51.281
I need to stay up and do this,
but you need to go to sleep.

01:39:51.283 --> 01:39:53.518
