Oh, my God!
We've been robbed!

00:38.188 --> 00:39.822
Come on out,
you thieving bastards!

00:39.890 --> 00:42.124
Dad!
Hayley, you were elected
family gun shield

00:42.192 --> 00:43.492
at the last family meeting.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.561
You're also in charge
of the Netflix queue.

00:45.629 --> 00:46.996
Just know this:

00:47.063 --> 00:49.431
I never don't want to have
<i>Kindergarten Cop.</i>

00:49.499 --> 00:51.233
(Francine gasps)
(groans)

00:51.301 --> 00:52.968
Roger, did you see who did this?

00:53.036 --> 00:55.104
Yeah. I did this.
I was looking for clues

00:55.171 --> 00:56.805
to where you're throwing
my birthday party.

00:56.873 --> 00:58.440
Found nothing,
so I took a nap.

00:58.508 --> 01:00.876
Roger, we wanted it
to be a surprise.

01:00.944 --> 01:03.045
We're throwing you
a bowling party!

01:03.113 --> 01:05.915
Oh, a bowling party!
How original!

01:05.982 --> 01:08.684
Apparently, I'm a
13-year-old Latino kid.

01:08.752 --> 01:10.352
Well, what do <i>you</i>
want to do?

01:10.420 --> 01:12.221
Something <i>good.</i>
I mean, you rented out

01:12.289 --> 01:14.156
the amphitheater
for Steve's birthday.

01:14.224 --> 01:15.891
We went to
a 4 Non Blondes concert.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.927
It's not our fault
we were the only ones there.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.662
You took Hayley skydiving.

01:19.729 --> 01:21.463
Stan got <i>four</i>
pairs of jeans.

01:21.531 --> 01:23.165
I guess you had to come out of

01:23.233 --> 01:25.568
or regularly visit
Francine's clown hole

01:25.635 --> 01:26.902
to matter around this place!

01:26.970 --> 01:28.504
It <i>is</i> a happening spot.

01:28.572 --> 01:30.339
I want to do
something special.

01:30.407 --> 01:31.907
I'm turning 1,601.

01:31.975 --> 01:34.276
When I hit puberty,
warning, I'm gonna get

01:34.344 --> 01:36.045
a <i>lot</i> more
sexually aggressive.

01:36.112 --> 01:37.346
You have
any suggestions?

01:37.414 --> 01:39.181
Uh, yeah, everyone
should avoid wearing

01:39.249 --> 01:40.449
loose-fitting shorts
around me.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.518
I'll get in there!
(chuckles)

01:42.586 --> 01:44.954
But seriously, I want to do
what the greats do

01:45.021 --> 01:47.056
when they get celebrated:
I want a roast!

01:47.123 --> 01:48.891
Roger, do you even know
what a roast is?

01:48.959 --> 01:50.593
Of course I do!
I was a member

01:50.660 --> 01:52.194
of the Friars Club
in the '60s.

01:52.262 --> 01:53.395
I drove Phyllis Diller

01:53.463 --> 01:55.064
to two of her first
three abortions.

01:55.131 --> 01:56.832
She must have such regrets,

01:56.900 --> 01:58.734
never getting
her driver's license.

01:58.802 --> 02:00.269
I guess we
can do that.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.105
We'll dress up nice, throw a few
good-natured barbs your way.

02:03.173 --> 02:04.340
Good-natured?

02:04.407 --> 02:06.942
Oh, no, don't you dare
go light on me!

02:07.010 --> 02:09.311
The best roasts are
brutal and hilarious.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.779
Oh, I think it'll be fun.

02:10.847 --> 02:12.481
You can't participate,
Klaus. I hate you.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.384
I say that not out of anger,
but simply as a fact.

02:15.452 --> 02:17.486
It's 67 degrees outside,
and I hate you.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.254
Well, if that's what
you really want,

02:19.322 --> 02:20.789
then of course
we'll do it.

02:20.857 --> 02:22.625
Make it so, Fran-cisco.
(chuckles)

02:22.692 --> 02:24.059
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:24.127 --> 02:25.894
I have my
bowling league tonight.

02:28.765 --> 02:32.334
(Latin accent):
I'm-a roll a turkey
tonight, <i>ese.</i>

02:35.872 --> 02:37.706
Settle down, everyone.

02:37.774 --> 02:39.875
Who threw that?
MAN:
Your mother's ass!

02:39.943 --> 02:41.677
(snaps fingers)

02:41.745 --> 02:43.779
Due to recent
financial hardships,

02:43.847 --> 02:47.583
the CIA has been forced
to take on a corporate sponsor.

02:47.651 --> 02:49.251
That sponsor is

02:49.319 --> 02:52.054
Jones Enterprises,
makers of the Chia Pet.

02:52.122 --> 02:54.657
So from now on,
we'll be known

02:54.724 --> 02:57.393
as the Central <i>Human</i>
Intelligence Agency.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.695
(squeaking, whirring)

02:59.763 --> 03:00.896
Frank!

03:00.964 --> 03:02.498
Just let him go.

03:02.565 --> 03:05.334
The Chia Pet people
are sending a CIA family

03:05.402 --> 03:07.169
into space
for one year

03:07.237 --> 03:09.705
to see if Chia seeds
grow up there.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.775
The dream of an
afro on the moon

03:12.842 --> 03:14.877
is within our
grasp, people!

03:14.944 --> 03:16.779
MAN:
Looks like
your wife's (bleep).

03:16.846 --> 03:19.281
Kruger, you just got
yourself a month in Kabul!

03:19.349 --> 03:20.716
Now...
(clears throat)

03:20.784 --> 03:22.518
the agent chosen
for this mission

03:22.585 --> 03:24.586
was not only the most qualified,

03:24.654 --> 03:27.456
he also sold the most
magazine subscriptions.

03:27.524 --> 03:30.893
Congratulations,
Sanders!

03:30.960 --> 03:32.728
(polite applause)
Can't you even smile?

03:32.796 --> 03:34.496
I don't have
any friends in space!

03:34.564 --> 03:36.298
You're friends
with your sister!

03:36.366 --> 03:38.867
(band plays lively music)

03:38.935 --> 03:41.370
Good evening, and welcome
to the Smith family roast

03:41.438 --> 03:42.638
of Roger Smith.

03:42.706 --> 03:43.939
Say mean things, Stan!

03:44.007 --> 03:45.607
Talk about how he's gray!

03:45.675 --> 03:47.776
You ready, Roger?

03:47.844 --> 03:50.813
Roger is truly one of the most
interesting people I know.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.614
He's also
a pathetic drug addict.

03:52.682 --> 03:54.783
(laughter)

03:54.851 --> 03:56.785
Now, I'm gonna read a list
of different drugs,

03:56.853 --> 03:59.121
and, Roger, if you hear one
you're not on right now,

03:59.189 --> 04:00.656
raise your hand.

04:00.724 --> 04:03.892
"Cocaine. Heroin.
Ecstasy. Crack.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.428
"OxyContin. Meth.
Steroids.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.063
"Cooked-down Afrin.

04:08.131 --> 04:10.432
Euphoria, the fake
drug from <i>90210."</i>

04:10.500 --> 04:12.601
(loud laughter)

04:12.669 --> 04:14.536
Okay, next I'd like
to introduce a woman

04:14.604 --> 04:16.505
who is in a rare group
for Roger--

04:16.572 --> 04:18.406
one who hasn't (bleep) him
with a (bleep).

04:18.475 --> 04:19.575
Ho-ho!

04:19.642 --> 04:21.744
Let's hear it
for Francine Smith!

04:21.810 --> 04:23.412
(applause)

04:23.480 --> 04:24.913
(laughs):
Oh, thank you, Stan.

04:24.981 --> 04:28.751
Roger, you're the most
disgusting, out-of-shape

04:28.818 --> 04:31.620
piece of (bleep) I've
ever met in my life.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.655
And I know Sammy Hagar.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.824
(laughing raucously)

04:35.892 --> 04:38.627
(laughing)

04:38.695 --> 04:41.330
A few years ago, we thought
it would be a good idea

04:41.397 --> 04:42.631
to get Roger a
checking account

04:42.699 --> 04:44.066
to teach him
responsibility.

04:44.134 --> 04:45.467
Here's what
old Rog did.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.269
Here's check 001,

04:47.337 --> 04:49.404
the only check
Roger ever wrote.

04:49.472 --> 04:51.774
(Stan laughing)
Please note that
in the date line

04:51.841 --> 04:54.943
he's written:
"Today comma 1783."

04:55.011 --> 04:57.746
It's made out for the
amount of $72 million,

04:57.814 --> 04:59.748
and it's payable
to "Drugs."

04:59.816 --> 05:01.950
(family laughing)
On the memo line,
it says:

05:02.018 --> 05:03.252
"For drugs, yo,"

05:03.319 --> 05:05.087
and it's signed
"John Travolta."

05:05.155 --> 05:07.156
(laughing loudly)

05:09.092 --> 05:11.827
Anyway, this was the
only check he ever wrote.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.163
The rest of the checks
have holes in them,

05:14.230 --> 05:17.032
because Roger got
drunk and raped them.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.302
(family laughing uncontrollably)

05:20.370 --> 05:22.938
Roger's June 4 diary entry.

05:23.006 --> 05:24.840
It says: "Million-dollar ideas."

05:24.908 --> 05:27.342
And under it, it reads:
"Diarrhea equals Rhea Perlman."

05:27.410 --> 05:28.677
STAN (laughing):
No-ho-ho-ho!

05:28.745 --> 05:30.813
The rest of the pages
have holes in them

05:30.880 --> 05:32.114
because he raped them.

05:32.182 --> 05:33.882
(family laughing)

05:33.950 --> 05:36.685
(chuckling)

05:36.753 --> 05:39.288
All right, it's time to hear
from the man of the hour.

05:39.355 --> 05:40.956
Roger, you drunk, lazy (bleep),

05:41.024 --> 05:43.826
get the waiter's (bleep) out
of your mouth and get up here!

05:43.893 --> 05:46.395
(band playing lively music)

05:49.532 --> 05:51.133
(music fades out)

05:51.201 --> 05:53.836
(voice wavering):
Why? Why would you do this?

05:53.903 --> 05:57.372
What... what did I ever do
to any of you to make you say

05:57.440 --> 05:59.708
those incredibly hurtful things?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.243
Are you serious?

06:01.311 --> 06:03.078
Does it look like
I'm not serious?!

06:03.146 --> 06:04.847
Roger, this is
what you asked for.

06:04.914 --> 06:06.381
You stay away
from me, Francine!

06:06.449 --> 06:08.283
All of you
stay away from me!

06:08.351 --> 06:11.286
This has been the worst night
of my entire life!

06:11.354 --> 06:13.956
(sobbing loudly)

06:19.158 --> 06:20.191
Morning.

06:20.194 --> 06:21.494
Roger!
Where have you been?

06:21.562 --> 06:23.096
We haven't seen you
in days!

06:23.164 --> 06:24.631
Getting my life together--
that's where.

06:24.699 --> 06:27.200
Those comments you made
the other night resonated in me,

06:27.268 --> 06:29.569
and I decided it was time
for a change.

06:29.637 --> 06:31.538
We didn't say those things
so you'd change.

06:31.605 --> 06:32.939
We were just poking fun.

06:33.007 --> 06:35.542
Well, the person you described
in graphic detail

06:35.609 --> 06:38.578
and in decent joke form
is <i>not</i> someone I want to be.

06:38.646 --> 06:41.314
I got a job at a bank,
which should address

06:41.382 --> 06:42.949
the monetary problem
Hayley pointed out,

06:43.017 --> 06:44.651
and I'm also
three days sober.

06:44.719 --> 06:47.320
Stan, thank you for that
very loud wake-up call.

06:47.388 --> 06:49.122
Who's that positive
girl with you?

06:49.190 --> 06:50.690
This is Ally,
my life coach.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.325
She also works
at Jumbo Juice.

06:52.393 --> 06:55.361
She gave me a fiber boost.
Then she gave me a <i>life</i> boost.

06:55.429 --> 06:58.898
(squealing-laughing)

06:58.966 --> 07:00.300
(squealing yell)

07:00.367 --> 07:01.868
She has weird energy,
doesn't she?

07:01.936 --> 07:03.570
She also made me
a goal list.

07:03.637 --> 07:05.638
This is the first piece of paper

07:05.706 --> 07:07.273
I haven't sexually
assaulted in years.

07:07.341 --> 07:10.043
So... you're not mad
at us anymore?

07:10.111 --> 07:12.212
God, no!
You saved my life!

07:12.279 --> 07:15.148
Okay, because you were madder
than we've ever seen you,

07:15.216 --> 07:17.550
and you do have a history
of holding grudges.

07:17.618 --> 07:18.885
What? No, I don't.

07:18.953 --> 07:20.720
You wrote death threats
to Merlin Oln

07:20.788 --> 07:22.756
for seven years after
<i>Father Murphy</i> was cancelled.

07:22.823 --> 07:24.257
He was just
the star, Roger.

07:24.325 --> 07:26.893
That was the old me.
I'm done with all that.

07:26.961 --> 07:29.929
And by the way, Merlin
had a producer credit
the second season.

07:29.997 --> 07:31.064
He could have done
something.

07:33.868 --> 07:36.035
Ah, I'm off for
a little night run

07:36.103 --> 07:37.437
at the Howard
University track.

07:37.505 --> 07:39.472
Sit down and
have dinner first.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.074
Thank you, no.
I'm going for a run,

07:41.142 --> 07:43.309
and I have to leave here
right now, immediately.

07:43.377 --> 07:44.911
KLAUS:
Guys, get in here!

07:44.979 --> 07:47.514
The porn channel's
cong in for some reason!

07:47.581 --> 07:49.149
(porn movie music playing)

07:49.216 --> 07:50.316
Nice.

07:50.384 --> 07:52.852
(all coughing)

07:52.920 --> 07:54.254
Is everyone okay?

07:54.321 --> 07:56.089
Did we lose the porn?

07:56.157 --> 07:57.891
There must have been
a gas leak!

07:57.958 --> 07:59.559
We could have all
been killed.

07:59.627 --> 08:02.328
You know, Roger sure
did leave in a hurry.

08:02.396 --> 08:04.931
You... you don't think
Roger had something to do

08:04.999 --> 08:06.466
with the explosion!

08:06.534 --> 08:07.834
Because of the roast?

08:07.902 --> 08:10.236
Guys, you heard him: we inspired
him to better himself.

08:10.304 --> 08:11.971
Still, to be safe,
we should follow him.

08:12.039 --> 08:13.306
You know, just to see

08:13.374 --> 08:15.275
if he's doing all the
things he says he is.

08:19.747 --> 08:20.847
...and $300.

08:20.915 --> 08:22.816
Have a good one.

08:22.883 --> 08:25.819
Hey, Liz, I'm thinking about
going to Nordstrom's at lunch.

08:25.886 --> 08:27.921
Do you want to grab a sandwich

08:27.988 --> 08:30.023
and walk around Nordstrom's
at lunch, Elizabeth?

08:35.529 --> 08:38.331
(panting)

08:45.806 --> 08:47.874
You know, the other day
I took a walk

08:47.942 --> 08:49.442
down to George C. Scott Park

08:49.510 --> 08:51.077
right when the sun
was going down.

08:51.145 --> 08:52.879
You know how that time is like.

08:52.947 --> 08:55.014
Sun throwing shadows and all.

08:55.082 --> 08:57.283
Got me thinking about
when I was a young man

08:57.351 --> 08:59.552
sitting in that park,
you know, watching the girls,

08:59.620 --> 09:01.955
smoking a little herb,
drinking a cold beer.

09:02.022 --> 09:05.725
And I had this moment when
I wanted to feel that way agn.

09:07.094 --> 09:08.728
But I didn't get high.

09:08.796 --> 09:11.464
Instead, I went home
and watched <i>The Wire.</i>

09:11.532 --> 09:13.266
That's where
this speech is from.

09:13.334 --> 09:14.767
Thanks for letting me share.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.441
(family laughing)

09:21.508 --> 09:23.376
You guys thought
I tried to kill you?

09:23.444 --> 09:24.777
Hilarious!

09:24.845 --> 09:27.413
(laughter)

09:27.481 --> 09:29.649
It's so therapeutic
to laugh.

09:29.717 --> 09:32.118
Hey, does anyone have
the exact time?

09:32.186 --> 09:33.786
8:04.
Thank you,
my love.

09:33.854 --> 09:35.255
Ow. Ow.

09:35.322 --> 09:37.957
Oh, my running regimen
is killing my lower back.

09:38.025 --> 09:39.259
(groans)
I got to lie down.

09:39.326 --> 09:41.494
(automatic gunfire)

09:41.562 --> 09:44.530
You guys can get up now!
It's definitely over!

09:44.598 --> 09:46.299

Someone <i>is</i> trying to kill us!

09:50.104 --> 09:53.706
Let's get out of here!
Get in the car! Let's go!

09:53.774 --> 09:55.909

09:55.976 --> 09:57.610

10:00.447 --> 10:01.748

10:01.815 --> 10:04.317
Roger might be
trying to kill us.

10:04.385 --> 10:05.418
And we have
no brakes.

10:05.486 --> 10:06.920

10:06.987 --> 10:08.922

10:14.228 --> 10:16.062

10:17.498 --> 10:19.966
Wow! This is a
really safe car!

10:20.034 --> 10:21.401
Of course it is, son.

10:21.468 --> 10:22.669
The new Chevy Tumbler

10:22.736 --> 10:24.704
has driver-
and passenger-side air bags,

10:24.772 --> 10:26.839
as well as head-curtain
side-impact air bags.

10:26.907 --> 10:28.908
Plus an all-new
third row of seats,

10:28.976 --> 10:31.544
and OnStar with a one-year
"Safe and Sound" plan.

10:31.612 --> 10:34.280
WOMAN:
This is OnStar.
Is everything okay, Mr. Smith?

10:34.348 --> 10:36.049
Everything's fine, Elaine.
Thank you.

10:49.563 --> 10:51.764
You guys all got up

10:53.300 --> 10:54.801

10:56.236 --> 10:57.337
Roger!

10:57.404 --> 10:58.638
It's too late!

10:58.706 --> 11:00.606
A switch went off
inside me that night,

11:00.674 --> 11:03.109
and now all I think about
is killing you guys.

11:03.177 --> 11:04.978
That's been my real
goal all along.

11:06.347 --> 11:07.747
My first few attempts failed,

11:07.815 --> 11:10.116
so I'm changing my approach,
gonna get more creative.

11:10.184 --> 11:12.251
Nothing's set in stone,
although I'm pretty sure

11:12.319 --> 11:14.120
these scorpions are going
in Steve's butt.

11:14.188 --> 11:15.722
They're rare butthole-eating
scorpions

11:15.789 --> 11:17.757
and they cost me
2,000 bucks each,

11:17.825 --> 11:21.027
but then I'm not very good
with money, am I, Hayley?

11:21.095 --> 11:22.829
Roger, you need
to stop this now!

11:22.896 --> 11:24.864
I'm never gonna stop.

Nice shot, Steve.

Every shot's a nice shot
with a McGregor tranq gun.

McGregor. It's Scottish
for bull's-eye.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.015
What are we gonna do now?

11:42.082 --> 11:44.450
Well, Roger's clearly
committed to killing us all.

11:44.518 --> 11:46.686
So I'm gonna put him
somewhere he can't hurt us.

11:53.193 --> 11:55.361
STAN:

<i>Maximum Security Prison.</i>

12:25.192 --> 12:26.993

Prison in Thailand.

12:27.061 --> 12:28.628
The prisoner killed
two dozen guards;

12:28.695 --> 12:30.963
then built a boat out
of their corpses to get away.

to this paper,

18:27.591 --> 18:29.092
Insults in the
form of jokes.

18:29.159 --> 18:30.526
How's it feel, Hayley?

18:30.594 --> 18:31.761
Not too <i>bueno,</i> I bet.

18:31.829 --> 18:32.996
Okay, now do Steve.

18:33.063 --> 18:35.331
Steve, you will
never get laid.

18:35.399 --> 18:36.599
There's nothing attractive
about you.

18:36.667 --> 18:37.967
You have the sex appeal

18:38.035 --> 18:40.069
of the cancer ward
in a pediatric hospital.

18:40.137 --> 18:41.871
(laughing)
Oh.

18:41.939 --> 18:44.340
Hayley coming in
with a groaner. Nice.

18:44.408 --> 18:46.776
Okay, Steve, let's see you
give it to your mama.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.513
Mom, you are
not smart.

18:50.581 --> 18:52.849
I don't tell "yo mama's
so dumb" jokes.

18:52.916 --> 18:55.285
I tell "my mama's
so dumb" jokes.

18:55.352 --> 18:57.320
Example:
My mama's so dumb,

18:57.388 --> 18:59.555
I don't tell "yo
mama's so dumb" jokes.

18:59.623 --> 19:02.025
I tell "my mama's
so dumb" jokes.

19:02.092 --> 19:03.526
I love it.

19:03.594 --> 19:06.195
Francine, take the pain and
throw it right at Stan. Do it!

19:06.263 --> 19:08.931
Stan, you have
the undeserved ego

19:08.999 --> 19:10.700
of Jeremy Piven,

19:10.768 --> 19:12.602
the annoying
self-righteousness

19:12.670 --> 19:14.103
of Sean Penn,

19:14.171 --> 19:15.605
and the unbearable
hypocrisy

19:15.673 --> 19:17.140
of Rush Limbaugh.

19:17.207 --> 19:19.542
What I'm trying
to say is,

19:19.610 --> 19:22.211
you're almost as bad a
person as Rachael Ray.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.355
(laughs)

19:32.423 --> 19:34.290
(all laughing)

19:36.026 --> 19:37.827
Why are you laughing?

19:37.895 --> 19:39.062
That wasn't funny.

19:39.129 --> 19:40.530
That's, like,
the meanest thing

19:40.597 --> 19:41.898
anyone's ever said
to anyone.

19:41.965 --> 19:43.666
What the hell's
going on here?

19:43.734 --> 19:45.034
Where's the
hurt feelings?

19:45.102 --> 19:47.103
Roger, we can say these things
to each other

19:47.171 --> 19:48.338
because we're family.

19:48.405 --> 19:49.605
It doesn't hurt my feelings

19:49.673 --> 19:51.374
because I still know
they love me.

19:51.442 --> 19:53.343
Well, your roast
hurt my feelings!

19:53.410 --> 19:54.944
Wait a minute.

19:55.012 --> 19:57.647
You don't consider yourself
part of this family, do you?

19:57.715 --> 19:59.315
No, 'cause
I'm not.

19:59.383 --> 20:00.550
Are you
kidding me?!

20:00.617 --> 20:02.385
We tried to throw you
a bowling party.

20:02.453 --> 20:03.786
We-we did the roast
you wanted...

20:03.854 --> 20:05.054
If after all
this time,

20:05.122 --> 20:06.823
you still don't feel
part of this family,

20:06.890 --> 20:07.990
it's your hang-up.

20:08.058 --> 20:09.459
Roger, we love you.

20:09.526 --> 20:10.893
You're a Smith.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.096
If you can't accept that,
go (bleep) yourself.

20:13.163 --> 20:16.099
Oh. Oh, my God.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.735
I <i>am</i> a part of this family.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.636
You do love me.

20:20.704 --> 20:22.705
I feel it now.

20:22.773 --> 20:24.374
I'm-I'm...

20:24.441 --> 20:26.342
I'm letting it
wash over me.

20:26.410 --> 20:27.944
Look at me.

20:28.011 --> 20:31.114
I'm crying like Francine
when she watches <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

20:31.181 --> 20:34.050
I just feel so sorry
for those poor actors.

20:34.118 --> 20:36.185
(all laughing)

20:36.253 --> 20:38.388
Hey, Roger, go
take some Euphoria

20:38.455 --> 20:39.989
and rape the
data journal!

20:40.057 --> 20:41.457
(all laughing)

20:42.461 --> 20:43.561
I've been eyeing it.

20:43.629 --> 20:44.696
I'm not gonna lie.

20:44.806 --> 20:46.673
(all laughing)

20:49.159 --> 20:50.293
(sighs)

20:50.360 --> 20:51.494
Fun birthday.

20:51.562 --> 20:52.595
(gagging)

20:54.698 --> 20:57.400
Hey, never thought I'd see
you dirty bastards again.

20:57.468 --> 20:59.102
Ah. I feel great.

20:59.169 --> 21:00.403
Cleaned out.

21:00.471 --> 21:01.871
All right, who wants them next?

21:03.040 --> 21:04.307
No one?

21:04.374 --> 21:05.475
Okay, you heard 'em.

21:05.542 --> 21:06.709
Round two, boys.

21:06.777 --> 21:08.411
Now make sure this time
that you really...

21:08.479 --> 21:09.712
(grunts, sighs)

21:09.780 --> 21:10.814
Oh. Oh, you know
what you're doing.
