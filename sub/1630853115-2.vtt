00:20.854 --> 00:22.772
[Lady Whistledown] Dearest reader.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.858
It has been said that competition

00:24.941 --> 00:28.194
is an opportunity for us
to rise and stand ready

00:28.278 --> 00:30.780
before our greatest of challenges.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.826
Well, if what this author hears
this morning is true,

00:34.909 --> 00:36.578
then a great challenge

00:36.661 --> 00:41.166
concerning this season's diamond
has been set forth, indeed.

00:41.249 --> 00:45.837
Any suitor wishing to gain
an audience with Miss Edwina Sharma

00:45.920 --> 00:50.175
must first tame
the rather prickly spinster of a beast

00:50.258 --> 00:53.344
otherwise known as her sister.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.264
Lord Lumley. At the top.

00:56.347 --> 00:57.891
Is he not something of a dandy?

00:57.974 --> 01:01.436
-I would use the term gallant.
-Is that what you look for, Edwina?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.815
If Kate believes in him, so do I.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.193
-Miss Sharma?
-Miss Edwina Sharma.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.111
Not the sister.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.238
Miss Edwina will suffice.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.908
I see you've left off Lord Bridgerton.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.494
Oh, now, he is what Edwina is looking for.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.329
An oversight on your part, my dear?

01:19.412 --> 01:23.291
Lord Bridgerton is quite adept
at conveying false first impressions.

01:23.374 --> 01:24.626
What did you hear?

01:24.709 --> 01:28.338
He stated rather clearly that
he seeks a wife only to fulfill his duty

01:28.421 --> 01:30.256
and does not believe in love at all.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.300
It is only out
of the greatest love of my family

01:32.383 --> 01:35.512
that I aim to choose a bride
with my head and not my…

01:36.679 --> 01:37.514
heart.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.432
And you find this unusual?

01:40.016 --> 01:45.271
Most marriages of the ton are, in fact,
mere matters of business, my dear.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.690
Matters that have been working
for centuries.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.361
It is the true love match
that is quite rare.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.404
Does Miss Edwina return your affection?

01:53.488 --> 01:56.533
[sighs] Not yet.
She would have done if it were not for--

01:56.616 --> 01:58.243
The sister.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.870
-She's rather thorny, I take it?
-Indeed.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.206
You know what it is
you are looking for, Bon.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.499
You must not forget it.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.752
Lord Lumley will turn the viscount
into a distant memory.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.713
-I am certain.
-Though she need not trouble me.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.509
Every rose does have its thorn, after all.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.845
[Lady Whistledown]
Of course, the only competition

02:16.928 --> 02:20.223
that compels my attention
is the game of courtship.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.184
So best of luck to this year's players.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.771
Do try not to stumble
on the starting line.

02:35.738 --> 02:39.492
Many dismiss Blake's work
as childlike, insubstantial…

02:41.035 --> 02:41.870
[sighs]

02:41.953 --> 02:44.539
Miss Sharma, am I to be kept
at this threshold all day?

02:44.622 --> 02:47.542
Lumley's already had
an inordinate amount of time with her.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.962
That is because my sister
is so enraptured with him at the moment.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.381
You wouldn't want me
to interrupt your discourse

02:53.464 --> 02:55.133
when it is your turn, would you?

02:55.717 --> 02:57.218
[Anthony] I say we heed the young lady

02:57.302 --> 02:59.137
and wait with the grace
our hostess affords us.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.805
Thank you, Lord…

03:02.015 --> 03:02.974
Bridgerton.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.227
[sighs] I'm afraid
you are much too late, my lord.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.981
You now find yourself at the back
of a very considerably long queue.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.360
I wish to escort Miss Edwina
to the races this afternoon.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.279
My sister already has
an escort this afternoon.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.072
-Tomorrow then.
-She's engaged tomorrow too.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.365
And the day after?

03:19.449 --> 03:20.992
Now that I think of it, she may be free…

03:21.075 --> 03:22.493
-Ah.
-…after December.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.246
Unless, of course,
she is on her honeymoon by then.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.624
[laughs]

03:27.707 --> 03:29.083
Did I say something funny?

03:29.167 --> 03:30.418
I believe you did.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.837
What is funny, my lord, is you here now,

03:32.921 --> 03:34.923
after what I overheard the other night--

03:35.006 --> 03:36.174
That was not for your ears.

03:36.257 --> 03:39.177
But also, in addition to everything
I have now read of you,

03:39.260 --> 03:41.888
your dubious and libertine reputation
goes before you.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.974
No intrusions, Bridgerton!
End of the queue.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.769
-[man 1] Yes, that's right.
-[man 2] That's right.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.035
Is that a copy of Lady Whistledown?

04:04.535 --> 04:06.454
-It is.
-I thought we were done with her.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.414
Do not discourage her, Penelope.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.209
If she has taken an interest
in Lady Whistledown again,

04:11.292 --> 04:13.086
perhaps she's interested
in what she has to say

04:13.169 --> 04:15.588
about the season's
available gentlemen too.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.343
I cannot think of any cleverer way
to say this, but no.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.264
Her latest is not exactly
the philosophical treatise

04:24.347 --> 04:26.557
on the rights of the fairer sex
I was hoping for, but--

04:26.641 --> 04:28.059
I do not think Lady Whistledown

04:28.142 --> 04:30.436
has changed her style
of writing since her last issue.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.814
Perhaps not. But perhaps she still can.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.315
Perhaps she does not want to.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.733
Perhaps she is quite content.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.278
And if she's even sparked
your renewed interest, El,

04:38.361 --> 04:40.530
then perhaps whatever
she is doing is working.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.699
Yes, but she could do so much more.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.035
I know I could convince her of it.
If I were to find her this time.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.038
What you must find, my dear, is happiness.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.832
Penelope, assist me here.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.668
Eloise could find that
with someone else, could she not?

04:53.751 --> 04:56.045
I believe she could.
And not Lady Whistledown,

04:56.129 --> 04:58.339
but someone more like-- Colin.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.592
-My brother?
-No, not Coli-- Colin!

05:01.676 --> 05:03.386
Glad to see things have not changed.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.595
-Brother!
-Colin!

05:04.679 --> 05:07.473
Could you set aside
the latest family squabble and embrace me?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.892
[all chuckling happily]

05:09.976 --> 05:13.104
[gasps] I did not expect you
to return so soon, dearest.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.148
Well, I missed you all. What can I say?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.740
-[Hyacinth] Brother!
-[Gregory] Brother!

05:23.823 --> 05:24.866
[Colin gasps]

05:24.949 --> 05:27.493
I believe we must get you
to the doctor post-haste.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.538
This strange, fuzzy growth on your chin
is some kind of disease.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.916
And you seem to have taken
to the sun too. How peculiar.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.794
-I think he looks distinguished.
-I'm now two inches taller than Gregory.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.379
You are not.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.257
And where, may I ask,
is our intrepid viscount?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.216
He is…

05:43.176 --> 05:45.011
back from courting already.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.722
Colin! You are returned. Even better.

05:47.805 --> 05:51.184
Family, I should like you all
to ready yourselves for the races today.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.978
We will be attending, united as one.

06:00.443 --> 06:04.155
I told him it would never do,
ma'am, but he insisted.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.325
Is that Cousin Jack's?

06:07.408 --> 06:10.119
Cousin? Is that what
he asked you to call him?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.954
Are you bothered by him, Mama?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.539
Of course not.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.127
The new Lord Featherington has come
to shower us with many riches indeed.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.589
If we must endure a few…
dubious style choices in return,

06:21.672 --> 06:25.301
along with some rather
questionable matters of breeding, then

06:26.302 --> 06:27.261
so be it.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.972
I also hear he wishes
to convert the morning room

06:30.056 --> 06:32.141
into his own personal gaming hell.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.147
Ah. Now, that looks splendid.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.233
Livens up the place, yes?

06:40.316 --> 06:42.026
It is a happy addition, my lord.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.237
Though, perhaps happier
in your own bedchamber.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.822
Have you shot them all, Cousin Jack?

06:45.905 --> 06:50.118
Every weapon here has a splendid history
and is worthy of interest, Penelope.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.079
I shall have to fill you in
on all of my adventures one day.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.792
Now, ladies, run along and get dressed.
We head to the Royal Races today.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.802
It will be an intimate ceremony.

07:07.885 --> 07:11.639
But Mr. Finch said he wished
for nothing to distract from his bride,

07:11.722 --> 07:13.099
if you can believe it.

07:13.182 --> 07:16.185
I certainly cannot. Can you, Penelope?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.728
Have you seen the Bridgertons?

07:22.483 --> 07:24.902
It is a marvel you love literature
as much as I do.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.362
Do you enjoy Byron?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.905
[Edwina] I have read some, my lord.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.324
Though I believe myself a novice
when it comes to poetry.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.076
How fortunate to have found

07:32.160 --> 07:34.704
such a well-versed teacher
in Lord Lumley, then.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.291
Many find poetry a flat medium.
Words read silently from a page.

07:38.374 --> 07:41.502
But I believe it is meant
to be read aloud like music.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.381
Here, I carry a small pocket copy
of my favorites with me wherever I go.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.633
Lady Danbury. I would be so honored

07:47.717 --> 07:50.386
if you could facilitate
a proper introduction.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.931
I fear my calling card got lost
in the shuffle at your home this morning.

07:54.015 --> 07:54.932
Of course.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.477
Mr. Thomas Dorset, allow me to introduce

07:57.560 --> 08:00.813
Miss Sharma and Miss Edwina Sharma.

08:00.897 --> 08:01.856
A pleasure.

08:01.939 --> 08:05.776
I am afraid my sister already has
an escort for today, Mr. Dorset.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.071
That is very well.
Though I was hoping to speak with you.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.870
How are you finding
the season, Miss Sharma?

08:15.953 --> 08:18.623
It is a season. [chuckles]
Mr. Dorset, I really should--

08:18.706 --> 08:20.833
London is a far cry from Bombay.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.753
It is where you traveled from, yes?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.464
-Yes.
-I have visited.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.382
It is a wondrous place.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.261
-You must miss it dearly.
-Oh, every minute of every day.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.972
But most especially at teatime.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.098
[chuckles lightly]

08:45.399 --> 08:47.068
We should find our seats.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.444
Allow me to join you.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.029
[Kate clears throat]

08:51.656 --> 08:52.949
[Will] Bridgertons!

08:53.658 --> 08:57.203
Mr. Mondrich.
It appears retirement suits you well.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.788
If only he were retired.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.873
Are you planning
another foray into the ring?

09:00.957 --> 09:03.918
Into business, in fact.
I am opening a gentlemen's club.

09:04.001 --> 09:08.297
Set to rival even the select haunts
on St. James's, if we are fortunate.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.008
You do know we have all been
members of White's since birth.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.678
Our grand opening is tomorrow night.
You're all invited--

09:13.761 --> 09:15.763
Apologies. If you will excuse me.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.767
Tell me, Mr. Mondrich.
I wouldn't mind some stimulation.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.978
Just look at your brother.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.731
The social season
frustrated him at first too,

09:25.815 --> 09:28.359
but now it seems this Miss Edwina

09:28.442 --> 09:30.945
has quickened his interest
and pleasure in courtship.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.072
I only mean to say, Eloise,

09:33.155 --> 09:37.034
that we must be willing to look
to find the partner that will excite us.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.619
So dance with a bevy of frogs,

09:38.703 --> 09:40.496
and one of them
might turn out to be a prince?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.831
If that's what you must do.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.543
Your father, you know…

09:46.544 --> 09:49.046
Are you listening to me?
What do you have in your hand?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.090
Nothing, Mama. It is only a pamphlet on

09:52.216 --> 09:55.219
new methods
for the tidying of dogs, apparently.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.264
Well, a lady is allowed
her hobbies, is she not?

09:58.347 --> 09:59.557
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.600
[Violet chuckles]

10:02.184 --> 10:03.394
[Violet sighs]

10:04.729 --> 10:08.524
Mr. Dorset, you travel widely, then?
And continuously, it seems.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.320
Well, for my studies.
I find medicine particularly fascinating.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.323
The helping of others
is a noble interest, indeed.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.409
Mr. Dorset is much like you
in that regard, Sister.

10:19.577 --> 10:23.414
Edwina, have you spoken
to Lord Lumley of his interests at all?

10:23.497 --> 10:24.874
Lord Bridgerton.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.294
Miss Sharma. Miss Edwina. Lumley.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.171
[Edwina] How delightful
to see you, my lord.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.506
Lord Bridgerton,
allow me to introduce myself.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.841
Mr. Thomas Dorset.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.511
Miss Edwina, I was hoping
to call on you this morning…

10:37.595 --> 10:39.555
My sister is well aware of everything--

10:39.639 --> 10:41.599
…but promised my family
to join them for breakfast.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.560
We are exceptionally close.
Break our fasts together regularly.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.354
Oh.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.897
There they all are now.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.024
[laughter]

10:50.733 --> 10:54.570
One can tell a great deal about a man
from his family, I rather think.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.113
Yes, there are many excellent,

10:56.197 --> 10:58.324
affectionate families of the ton.
Are there not?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.618
Though none quite as inviting
as the Bridgertons.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.828
My mother's been wanting to enjoy

11:02.912 --> 11:05.039
another tea at Bridgerton House
for some time.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.916
Well, we must gratify your wish, Lumley.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.126
Speaking of refreshments,

11:09.210 --> 11:11.212
I could not help but notice
the ladies are without.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.296
We are content, thank you.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.633
[Anthony] It is an unseasonably hot day,
and any gentleman would make sure--

11:15.716 --> 11:18.219
Miss Edwina, allow me
to fetch a lemonade for you.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.930
Oh, that would be most agreeable.
Thank you, my lord.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.226
Excuse me.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.646
[grunts]

11:28.729 --> 11:29.939
[groans]

11:30.022 --> 11:31.023
[sighs]

11:31.691 --> 11:33.776
It's a splendid day for a race.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.530
-[bells chiming]
-[chattering]

11:50.376 --> 11:52.294
-Pen.
-Oh, Colin! [chuckles]

11:52.378 --> 11:54.213
We did not get a chance
to speak this morning.

11:54.296 --> 11:58.050
We did. I said, "Colin!"
But, then again, it was nothing of note.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.303
I had wanted to hear more
about your travels.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.764
I thought you would've been bored
of my travels by now.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.475
You read and replied to more
of my letters than anyone else.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.185
I suppose I did, though,

12:08.269 --> 12:11.272
there is always much more to say
than one can put onto the page.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.066
Pen.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.360
How have you been?

12:16.986 --> 12:19.822
Well. I have been well. And you?

12:20.406 --> 12:22.575
Do not answer that.
I know how you have been.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.745
Exploring the slopes
of Mount Olympus, falconry with the Turks.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.871
It was quite exhilarating.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.166
Also lonely, perhaps?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.208
[Colin] Mmm.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.252
Well, I was never on my own, of course.

12:33.335 --> 12:36.797
-I see. You met someone--
-Pen! I finally found you.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.798
You always do.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.217
You've been back hours,
yet you are already in my way.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.137
How I have missed you too, El.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.017
I believe I have made a discovery.
Whistledown's new printer.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.685
-Impossible.
-To mere mortals, perhaps.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.731
I am beginning to sense my true power now.
Do you notice the way this pamphlet feels?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.065
Like paper?

12:55.149 --> 12:57.943
Precisely. The paper stock is
the same texture as that of Whistledown.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.320
Does not all paper feel the same?

12:59.403 --> 13:01.989
Texture, weight, grain,
the way the light seeps through

13:02.072 --> 13:03.616
when you hold it to the sky. Look.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.826
[clears throat]

13:07.369 --> 13:09.371
-Yes, I must seem mad.
-I did not say--

13:09.455 --> 13:10.498
You were thinking it.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.209
You seem passionate.
But, El, it is likely a coincidence.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.212
That pamphlet is surely
just what it appears to be.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.673
Copious instructions for tending
to a dog's undergrowth, evidently.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.427
Most likely. I suppose you are right.

13:24.011 --> 13:27.932
Ugh. I must go and pretend to share in
the joy of my sister's impending nuptials.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.184
-Give the soon-to-be my regards.
-[chuckles]

13:40.194 --> 13:41.779
[speaking indistinctly]

13:41.862 --> 13:42.696
Oh, really?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.908
Lord Lumley seems to have got lost

13:45.991 --> 13:47.993
on his journey back
from the lemonade stand.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.245
I am happy to search for him.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.580
It was the viscount
who insisted on refreshments.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.790
Perhaps he might go?

13:52.873 --> 13:54.500
With the race set to begin? [chuckles]

13:54.583 --> 13:56.460
-Which one is your pick, my lord?
-Edwina.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.839
Nectar. Well-bred, highly trained,

13:59.922 --> 14:01.757
and well-favored.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.592
-[Kate] Nectar. Really?
-Yes.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.136
I have a feeling about him.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.263
A feeling.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.222
Pardon me?

14:08.305 --> 14:10.891
You simply chose the horse
everyone else has chosen.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.143
-Quite a "feeling."
-I made a strategic bet.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.020
So you've considered
your horse's temperament,

14:15.104 --> 14:16.605
as well as the conditions of the track,

14:16.689 --> 14:19.149
in order to properly
assess its true potential?

14:19.233 --> 14:21.861
-It is suddenly rather warm, is it not?
-Nectar is a prize steed.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.445
We should find a little more shade.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.282
Nectar ran well at Doncaster,
but that was a firmer course.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.159
The weather was much cooler.
Thus his size was an advantage.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.662
Today the track is soft, and it is hot,

14:31.745 --> 14:33.664
meaning he will struggle to make headway,

14:33.747 --> 14:35.916
overheat, and slow down
during the final leg,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.879
giving High Flyer, a much swifter,
lighter, cooler horse, the victory.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.633
-You think too much about it.
-And you, too little.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.511
It seems your guest
has caught the attention

14:47.595 --> 14:49.096
of the viscount, Lady Danbury.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.848
-It would seem so.
-[chuckles]

14:50.931 --> 14:54.435
You do understand that,
as Miss Edwina's sponsor,

14:54.518 --> 14:57.187
I should like to remain neutral
until she has made her choice.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.398
-Of course.
-But as your friend, I will tell you.

14:59.481 --> 15:02.276
There may be
an obstacle in your son's path.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.029
The elder sister
seems set against the match.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.781
It seems Miss Edwina desires a love match,

15:07.865 --> 15:09.950
something the viscount clearly does not.

15:10.868 --> 15:11.911
I see.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.665
Perhaps her mind can be changed.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.252
Perhaps so can the viscount's.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.254
[Lady Danbury] Mmm.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.010
My apologies for the delay.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.388
Not to worry. Lord Bridgerton
has been keeping us entertained.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.765
I am quite certain he has.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.142
There is plenty of room, my lord.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.685
[both chuckle]

15:42.232 --> 15:43.692
[bell tolling]

15:43.776 --> 15:46.987
-[crowd chattering]
-[exciting music playing]

15:49.114 --> 15:50.616
Yes! That's it, Nectar!

15:50.699 --> 15:51.951
-Come now, High Flyer!
-Yes!

15:52.034 --> 15:53.369
Steady! Steady!

15:56.205 --> 15:58.207
[crowd exclaiming]

15:58.290 --> 15:59.249
[laughing]

16:05.089 --> 16:07.383
-Come now, High Flyer! [whistles]
-Come on!

16:07.466 --> 16:09.468
[whistles loudly]

16:09.551 --> 16:12.012
-Should we separate them?
-It's all in good spirit.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.973
-I think.
-Yes, I am having such fun.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.436
-…on! Come on!
-Yes! [laughing]

16:25.401 --> 16:28.195
-Oh! Yes! Yes! [laughing]
-Come on!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.156
[shouting triumphantly]

16:31.240 --> 16:33.409
Prudence! Stop hollering like a newsboy.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.744
Let her cheer. We've all won today.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.829
[clears throat]

16:37.663 --> 16:38.831
[giggling quietly]

16:39.498 --> 16:42.668
I must say,
I have never bested a viscount before.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.337
Beating you feels
the same as any other win

16:45.421 --> 16:46.964
but somehow smells sweeter.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.259
Kate, does Nectar not remind you
of the beloved horse I used to adore?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.302
-Do you remember the one?
-Oh, well, take my arm.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.679
I'll take you down to see him.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.434
Excellent idea.

16:59.810 --> 17:03.480
Miss Sharma, I must ask.
Why do you jab at Lord Bridgerton so?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.150
If the viscount is serious
about courting my sister,

17:06.233 --> 17:08.068
is it not my duty to try his mettle?

17:08.152 --> 17:09.903
The viscount does not like to lose.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.322
He has never stomached it,
even back at Oxford.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.242
Oh. [chuckles]

17:15.325 --> 17:16.326
Miss Sharma, I--

17:16.410 --> 17:18.370
You and the viscount
know each other from Oxford?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.330
-I thought you met today.
-I have said too much.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.583
You are going to say
much more this very moment.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.671
He thought you'd judge me
if you knew we were acquaintances.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.758
But I must assure you that
my interest in you today was genuine--

17:30.841 --> 17:33.552
Genuine in the sense
you were sent here to distract me,

17:33.635 --> 17:36.805
all so Lord Bridgerton
could get closer to my sister.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.892
Kate, it is dreadful.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.977
They say Nectar
is to be sent to the knacker's yard.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.270
-We are leaving.
-[scoffs]

17:43.353 --> 17:46.065
I've heard of a sore loser,
Miss Sharma, but never a sore winner.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.984
Do not speak to me
or my sister ever again.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.027
What has happened?

17:50.110 --> 17:52.071
It seems a second game was afoot today,

17:52.154 --> 17:54.573
and Lord Bridgerton
made certain I play the fool.

17:54.656 --> 17:55.783
Let us go.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.332
I meant no harm.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.292
I only wished to spend time with you.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.595
[distant unclear shouting]

18:16.678 --> 18:18.388
[horses neighing]

18:22.643 --> 18:25.187
[driver] Whoa there. Whoa there.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.447
Miss Bridgerton, perhaps
this is not such a wise decision.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.658
Seemed wise when you took
my money to escort me here.

18:37.741 --> 18:38.742
I will return it.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.286
This part of town is not safe
for a young lady such as yourself.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.706
Take the other half.
Keep a watchful eye. No turning back now.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.166
[scoffs]

18:56.093 --> 18:57.094
[softly] No.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.805
[doorknob rattling]

19:06.520 --> 19:07.604
[groans]

19:07.688 --> 19:08.939
[clattering]

19:13.569 --> 19:14.528
What's this?

19:14.611 --> 19:16.989
-Tell me what you know of her.
-Of who?

19:17.072 --> 19:19.074
We know this is where
Lady Whistledown prints.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.827
-We do?
-Why did you think we were here?

19:21.910 --> 19:24.621
-I think you might be lost.
-I think you're evading my question.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.207
You never asked me a question.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.501
[clears throat]

19:29.585 --> 19:30.878
What are those papers?

19:30.961 --> 19:32.796
Nothing for the likes of you.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.340
Perhaps you might get
your trivial gossip from somewhere else.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.383
That is not what--

19:37.092 --> 19:39.178
I am not here in search of gossip.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.095
No?

19:40.179 --> 19:43.515
Private information about
the season's most eligible bachelor, then?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.142
Mmm?

19:45.225 --> 19:47.269
Your assumptions
are not the least bit surprising.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.771
After all, a woman is allowed
to have but two interests.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.357
Marriage, or spewing slander
about her peers, apparently.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.277
It'd never occur to you that I am,
in fact, hoping to find the writer

19:55.360 --> 19:58.197
so that we may discuss
much more intellective matters.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.740
The rights of woman.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.533
The exploration of her mind,

20:01.617 --> 20:04.620
a mind which, I can already discern,
is far, far superior to yours.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.667
Is the shock you seem
to be displaying at present

20:10.751 --> 20:13.587
due to the fact that
I appear well-read and articulate?

20:14.087 --> 20:17.007
Or do you suffer from some medical ailment
about which I should be informed?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.769
-This is not--
-If women's rights are what you're after,

20:28.852 --> 20:30.771
then perhaps that is
what you need to be reading.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.190
New thoughts. Unsettling ideas.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.692
Not too unsettling for you, I hope?

20:36.610 --> 20:39.947
Though, if I should ever see
Lady what's-her-name,

20:40.030 --> 20:42.741
I'll be sure to let her know that
her leading admirer says hello.

20:48.830 --> 20:49.873
[door closes]

20:50.874 --> 20:54.044
[minister] I now
pronounce you husband and wife.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.673
[light clapping]

20:59.258 --> 21:00.884
[Mrs. Finch] Oh, how wonderful.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.720
And to think,

21:03.804 --> 21:07.099
we are all one family now,
Lady Featherington.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.267
[chuckling] Yes.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.269
What a delightful thought.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.646
[Mr. Finch] We must tell
the new Lord Featherington.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.232
Where is the new Lord Featherington?

21:15.315 --> 21:18.527
He is here somewhere,
to be sure. Let me find him.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.071
You ensured the dowry was paid?

21:21.154 --> 21:23.198
Of course I ensured the dowry was paid!

21:24.157 --> 21:25.242
-Mmm.
-Ah.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.035
[knock at door]

21:30.289 --> 21:32.332
I would've been in attendance, my lady,

21:32.416 --> 21:35.085
but seeing how you wished
to keep the guest list small…

21:35.168 --> 21:38.422
What use are elaborate weddings anyway,
my lord, when there are

21:38.505 --> 21:41.300
so many more important matters
to spend one's money on?

21:41.383 --> 21:42.592
If you say so.

21:42.676 --> 21:47.180
Especially with two more young ladies
to wed and two more dowries to pay for.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.224
My word, this is a perplexing puzzle.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.227
Apparently I needed less skill
to dig my American mines

21:52.311 --> 21:54.730
than I do to understand
my late cousin's bookkeeping.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.648
Well, surely, to a man of your wealth,

21:56.732 --> 21:59.735
settling the estate's affair
shan't be of much concern?

21:59.818 --> 22:02.154
It'll certainly make a difference
to my immediate plans.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.322
Which would be?

22:04.364 --> 22:07.826
It may serve you well
to involve me in your plans, my lord.

22:07.909 --> 22:11.663
Perhaps we may act in concert in some way.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.373
You are new to town, after all.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.752
You could use someone
to keep you apprised of certain matters.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.838
-Well, in that, you are correct, my lady.
-Excellent--

22:19.921 --> 22:22.466
Which is, indeed,
why I plan on finding that someone

22:22.549 --> 22:23.800
sooner rather than later.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.345
[chuckles lightly]

22:26.428 --> 22:29.097
Your new relations are asking for you.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.100
Perhaps all this can wait.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.770
Let us go and enjoy Philippa's day.

22:36.646 --> 22:39.399
I do relish weddings.
Don't you, Mrs. Varley?

22:39.983 --> 22:40.984
[hesitantly] Oh.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.320
Certainly, my lord.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.490
[footsteps departing]

22:47.282 --> 22:49.534
He does have a pleasing smile. [chuckles]

22:50.118 --> 22:52.204
That smile will be the last thing we see

22:52.287 --> 22:55.207
after he installs some beef-witted chit
into our drawing room

22:55.290 --> 22:57.292
and ousts me out of my very own home.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.503
Let's see how pleasing you find it then.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.926
[Edwina] To be fair,
he did not exactly have many choices.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.594
You forbade him to call on me.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.346
-You think he was clever?
-No.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.305
I think--

23:10.389 --> 23:12.182
You told me Appa always said

23:12.265 --> 23:15.060
it takes a courageous man
to go after what he truly wants.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.105
Appa also said the mark
of a true gentleman is honesty.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.065
Something the viscount notably lacks.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.025
[doors open]

23:30.367 --> 23:31.410
Your Majesty.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.036
Lady Danbury.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.498
Miss Sharma. And my diamond.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.127
This way. There is much to see.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.882
They are called "zebra."

23:45.966 --> 23:48.927
Striped horses from Africa, in fact.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.096
Seven more arrive next week.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.306
Though I can't think
what to name them all.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.351
After 15 children,
I seem to have run out of ideas.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.312
It is the most spectacular menagerie,
Your Majesty.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.522
Indeed, it is.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.274
Miss Edwina?

24:02.858 --> 24:03.942
Yes, Your Majesty?

24:04.025 --> 24:06.278
I do hope
you have been enjoying the attention

24:06.361 --> 24:09.156
you have surely been receiving
as the season's diamond.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.534
Very much so, ma'am.
It has been an exceptional honor.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.912
It is not an easy mantle
to take on, you realize.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.291
To have so many eyes
upon you at all times.

24:19.374 --> 24:24.087
Regardless of the truth,
people… nay, gossips,

24:24.171 --> 24:27.174
they will contrive shameless falsehoods.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.760
Rumor can oftentimes
be a great hardship to endure.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.388
Just ask your mother. Just ask me.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.098
My sister aspires to learn

24:35.182 --> 24:37.726
from your illustrious example,
Your Majesty.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.812
Your marriage,
the wondrous love you share with the king.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.814
Edwina desires the very same.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.900
And she shall receive it,

24:44.983 --> 24:46.651
should she know who to trust.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.779
[Kate] Lady Danbury has been
a steadfast guide for us this season.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.948
And my sister has me watching her as well.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.659
An inner circle, if there ever was one.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.287
Though you must know
there will be many people

24:57.370 --> 24:59.122
trying to break it apart
for their own ends.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.417
When those persons
inevitably reveal themselves

25:02.501 --> 25:04.461
and their rather sly intentions,

25:04.544 --> 25:07.047
I simply ask
that you tell me who they are

25:07.130 --> 25:10.675
so that I may decide
if they are worthy, of course.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.469
Miss Sharma, perhaps you would like

25:12.552 --> 25:15.722
to take your sister to see
the rest of these splendid grounds.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.433
Yes. The cassowaries
are just across the bridge.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.268
But do not veer too close.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.229
They are quite irritable.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.278
Something tells me, ma'am,

25:30.362 --> 25:34.866
that there are quite a few
sly intentions at work here.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.910
Was I so obvious?

25:36.993 --> 25:40.205
You seek to unmask Lady Whistledown
with the help of your diamond.

25:40.288 --> 25:43.083
The writer will assuredly
seek access to her. And when she does,

25:43.166 --> 25:45.043
Her Majesty will be waiting.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.296
Is that why you chose
Miss Edwina in the first place?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.340
Someone who was not present last season--

25:50.423 --> 25:52.551
Meant she was
someone I knew I could trust.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.302
-Yes.
-[Lady Danbury] Mmm.

25:54.386 --> 25:58.306
Lady Danbury. Don't appear scandalized.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.101
You relish this frivolity
nearly as much as I do.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.728
This season is different.

26:05.105 --> 26:08.358
You may wish to spoil
your own fun, Lady Danbury,

26:08.441 --> 26:10.569
but you shall not ruin mine.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.446
Let me show you where I house my elephant.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.489
[Lady Danbury] Mmm.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.158
-[grunting]
-[blades swishing]

26:17.242 --> 26:20.912
She is pompous and arrogant and quite sure
she knows best in every situation.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.747
She sounds like a terrible nuisance.

26:22.831 --> 26:26.001
Especially since you are the one
who knows best in every situation.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.919
-[grunts]
-[blades swishing]

26:29.796 --> 26:30.880
[grunts]

26:30.964 --> 26:32.716
And the victor of every match today.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.676
Less talking, more fencing. Brother.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.304
[Benedict sighs]

26:37.387 --> 26:38.638
[Colin] Good luck.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.390
Ready?

26:45.729 --> 26:47.689
Do you know why I win every time?

26:47.772 --> 26:50.400
Because every time you lose,
you claim we cheated.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.861
Because I know my duties.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.530
What my purposes are
and how to obtain them.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.952
Which I will do when I make
Miss Edwina my viscountess.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.454
[Anthony grunts]

27:06.333 --> 27:08.084
Miss Edwina and I are well-suited.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.128
She is a lovely young lady.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.130
She wishes for children.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.675
She'll make a perfectly agreeable wife.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.093
What he means to say

27:17.177 --> 27:20.347
is that he has already dismissed
every other young lady in town.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.642
You take too much upon yourself, Brother.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.227
Perhaps your life might be easier
if you pursued someone

27:26.311 --> 27:27.896
with a less disagreeable sister.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.814
Why should I be the one to admit defeat?

27:32.942 --> 27:35.695
Regardless of which young lady
I have chosen to pursue,

27:35.779 --> 27:37.989
there would've always been
some obstinate father

27:38.073 --> 27:39.949
or meddlesome aunt into the picture.

27:40.033 --> 27:43.161
I shall certainly not let some sister,
especially one younger than me,

27:43.244 --> 27:44.954
keep me from getting what it is I want.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.748
Whom you want, you mean?

27:47.374 --> 27:50.794
Is this still a friendly match,
or do we need to find some armor?

27:50.877 --> 27:53.046
That is what
you do not understand, Brother.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.841
Benedict honors me
by holding nothing back.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.386
As I now

28:00.553 --> 28:01.513
honor him.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.394
-[Anthony] Yah! Yah!
-[Colin laughs]

28:08.228 --> 28:09.312
What honor.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.401
Thank you, gentlemen,
for the bracing exertion.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.822
Now it is time for me
to secure my final victory for the day.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.658
Wish me luck.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.456
They were called zebras, I believe.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.750
So it was a pleasant visit, then?

28:31.251 --> 28:33.211
I'm quite sorry I was unable to attend.

28:33.294 --> 28:36.589
I am certain it is not the last time
we will be invited to the palace.

28:36.673 --> 28:40.760
Her Majesty seemed quite taken
by Edwina, was she not, Lady Danbury?

28:41.302 --> 28:42.804
I was thinking.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.306
-A soiree this evening.
-[horse neighs]

28:45.390 --> 28:50.353
So that Miss Edwina may get to know
her many suitors rather better.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.896
I shall see to everything.

28:53.022 --> 28:53.982
Sounds delightful.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.193
So long as we are judicious
with our guest list. Pardon me.

28:57.777 --> 28:58.778
[door opens]

29:00.155 --> 29:01.072
Good boy.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.866
[Kate] How much clearer must I be?

29:02.949 --> 29:05.744
-I brought a gift for Miss Edwina.
-Take your Trojan Horse elsewhere.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.873
I assure you, this is a very real horse.
I'd not recommend trying to climb inside.

29:09.956 --> 29:12.584
-Truly, this is all a game to you.
-I'm not here to play games.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.295
Then what was Mr. Dorset,
if not some deceitful prank?

29:15.378 --> 29:18.757
The business with Mr. Dorset
was not so great a deceit as you imply.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.383
And now you question my judgment.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.801
Only because you questioned mine.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.805
I have never met a man
as brazenly presumptuous--

29:25.889 --> 29:26.973
You do not even know me.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.476
I know you are polished.
I know you are careful.

29:29.559 --> 29:32.061
I know you make promises
without so much as uttering a word.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.439
There is not much more I need to know.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.650
-[Anthony mutters]
-Thank you, sir.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.863
Is this about what you heard
on the terrace again?

29:43.198 --> 29:46.743
You act as if I'm some kind of villain
when every other woman in London aspires

29:46.826 --> 29:49.037
for the kind of marriage I'm offering.
You must know that.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.122
You have been exceptionally clear

29:51.206 --> 29:53.041
about what it is
you do and do not wish for,

29:53.124 --> 29:54.459
but has it ever occurred to you

29:54.542 --> 29:57.337
this might, in fact, be about
what your sister wishes for instead?

30:01.466 --> 30:02.801
Lord Bridgerton.

30:03.384 --> 30:04.302
Miss Edwina.

30:05.553 --> 30:08.264
I have brought you a small token

30:08.348 --> 30:10.767
to remember our fine time
at the races yesterday.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.101
[Edwina] Oh.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.394
The horse is for me?

30:15.104 --> 30:17.357
-I thought you loved animals.
-[Edwina] I do.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.109
But usually the kind
that can curl up on my lap.

30:20.985 --> 30:21.861
[chuckles softly]

30:23.488 --> 30:24.405
[chuckles softly]

30:24.489 --> 30:25.615
My apologies.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.576
You said something about

30:29.160 --> 30:31.788
Nectar reminding you
of a beloved horse back at--

30:31.871 --> 30:34.332
[Kate] That horse is
a character from a novel.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.251
A novel of love, in fact.

30:36.334 --> 30:39.295
Something for which
my sister is an enthusiast.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.092
[Edwina] I adore it, my lord.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.470
The horse is a generous gesture, indeed.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.227
Come, Edwina. We must return inside.

31:18.084 --> 31:21.504
Mr. Bridgerton!
You honor me with your presence.

31:21.588 --> 31:24.966
The honor's all mine, Mr. Mondrich.
The place looks extraordinary.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.051
Though, am I a little early?

31:27.135 --> 31:30.054
The crowd will increase
with time, naturally.

31:31.055 --> 31:34.309
I heard a rumor
that you yourself are an artist.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.602
Oh.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.270
I… dabble.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.396
[chuckles]

31:38.479 --> 31:39.439
Then,

31:40.023 --> 31:42.233
you must meet Mr. Cruikshank.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.777
He's a talented illustrator

31:44.861 --> 31:47.113
with many connections
amongst artists and patrons.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.532
I'm always excited
to meet talented people.

31:49.616 --> 31:53.202
This is precisely what makes
my establishment different, Bridgerton.

31:53.286 --> 31:57.332
I know you and your brothers are
comfortable at places like White's,

31:57.415 --> 32:02.211
but every honest man,
regardless of his title, rank,

32:02.295 --> 32:05.131
or occupation, is welcome

32:06.341 --> 32:07.342
to be here.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.929
I must say, Mr. Mondrich,
I'm quite overjoyed to see

32:11.012 --> 32:15.016
what a fine establishment you've built
by the sweat of your own honest labor.

32:15.516 --> 32:16.726
Hear, hear.

32:30.239 --> 32:31.449
[sighs softly]

32:46.381 --> 32:47.715
The tidying of dogs?

32:47.799 --> 32:52.512
Yes. Perhaps you have a friend
who finds the subject interesting.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.139
-Mother, are you quite well?
-No. No, she is not.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.811
I was unaware
there was a ball this evening.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.938
It is a soiree, rather.

33:02.021 --> 33:05.066
Did you not receive your invitation
from the Danbury footman?

33:06.359 --> 33:07.944
The soiree is at the Danbury House.

33:08.027 --> 33:11.447
[sighs] And Miss Sharma likes
to accuse me of playing games.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.199
-Can you blame her?
-[Anthony] What?

33:16.786 --> 33:18.830
She is looking out for her sister.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.331
She hopes to find her a love match.

33:20.415 --> 33:24.043
And with you, apparently so forthright
in your disdain for such a thing…

33:24.127 --> 33:25.003
[inhales deeply]

33:25.086 --> 33:29.340
Perhaps Miss Edwina's other suitors plan
on choosing words more wisely tonight.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.801
Some are reading poetry, I hear.

33:31.884 --> 33:32.802
[scoffs lightly]

33:32.885 --> 33:35.430
There is a lesson here
for you somewhere, Anthony.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.141
I only hope that this time
you will finally learn it.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.184
-Come along.
-[clears throat]

33:44.731 --> 33:46.065
[door opens]

33:48.443 --> 33:50.194
[flute playing unevenly]

33:56.325 --> 33:57.744
[metallic swishing]

33:58.745 --> 34:00.663
-[cymbals crashing]
-[all gasping]

34:01.539 --> 34:02.623
-[whooshing]
-[gasping]

34:02.707 --> 34:03.833
[soft laughter]

34:03.916 --> 34:06.711
[light clapping]

34:11.507 --> 34:12.383
[laughing]

34:14.010 --> 34:15.803
-[chuckles]
-[man grunting]

34:15.887 --> 34:19.474
At least it is the men who are
making fools of themselves this time.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.227
-Was this your idea?
-I wish I could take credit, but no.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.605
Lady Danbury encouraged a poetry reading.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.149
The men, thanks to their spirit
and competition,

34:28.232 --> 34:30.485
concocted the rest
of this farce on their own.

34:30.568 --> 34:31.527
Of course they did.

34:32.737 --> 34:33.946
[light clapping]

34:34.030 --> 34:36.449
[Lady Danbury laughs] Oh, yes. Marvelous.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.284
You are the viscount's sister, yes?

34:38.367 --> 34:40.870
One of them.
But do not hold it against me.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.082
[audience] Ooh.

34:45.666 --> 34:46.751
[laughter]

34:48.586 --> 34:52.298
The fact the viscount is your relation
almost makes me think better of him.

34:52.381 --> 34:55.885
We should certainly not give him
too much credit, now, should we? [laughs]

35:00.765 --> 35:01.641
What?

35:02.350 --> 35:04.477
Yes. Yes.

35:06.729 --> 35:09.023
How about a pause?

35:09.107 --> 35:09.941
[murmuring]

35:10.024 --> 35:11.234
[Lady Danbury] Yes.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.196
[light classical music playing]

35:17.532 --> 35:19.534
[indistinct chatter]

35:24.413 --> 35:25.873
[Penelope] A beautiful dress.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.626
[Edwina] Oh. Thank you.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.295
[chuckles softly]
I quite like yours as well.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.923
-You have a sense of humor.
-No, I did not mean--

35:34.507 --> 35:35.758
I am being truthful.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.219
It is quite beautiful, indeed.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.930
Well, I seem to have
grown weary of the color.

35:41.013 --> 35:41.848
[both chuckle]

35:41.931 --> 35:43.391
I can understand.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.853
Though, I suppose, in truth,
it is not a matter of the color,

35:46.936 --> 35:48.729
but rather how one wears it.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.439
You wear it well, Miss…

35:50.523 --> 35:52.066
Penelope. Featherington.

35:53.901 --> 35:54.944
Pardon me.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.746
So, what will it be for you tonight?

36:06.455 --> 36:08.583
A song? A jig?

36:09.125 --> 36:12.461
Some hidden hoop-rolling talent
you have yet to share with the world?

36:12.545 --> 36:14.755
I'm afraid I'm just a spectator.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.511
So much interest shown in a young lady
whom none of us really know.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.597
Hmm. Not a devotee of mystery, Pen?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.182
Me? No.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.726
I am always turning
to the final chapter first.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.521
Speaking of mysteries,

36:31.439 --> 36:33.566
you must tell me
the name of the young lady

36:33.649 --> 36:35.193
you met while out of the country.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.361
Now, what can you mean?

36:37.445 --> 36:42.074
You mentioned, at the races,
you were never lonely. I only assumed…

36:42.825 --> 36:44.452
Never mind. [clears throat]

36:45.119 --> 36:48.372
Look. There truly is someone
hoop-rolling tonight. [chuckles]

36:50.333 --> 36:51.334
You are right.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.503
I was not exactly lonely on my travels.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.423
I did begin a real conversation
with someone.

36:57.506 --> 37:00.051
Someone I had known for a very long time.

37:00.134 --> 37:03.763
And yet, after everything
that happened with Miss Thompson,

37:03.846 --> 37:05.097
I realized

37:05.181 --> 37:07.141
I never truly knew this person at all.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.144
Myself.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.354
Yourself?

37:12.271 --> 37:13.522
I have you to thank.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.525
Your letters were so encouraging.

37:17.443 --> 37:20.029
I thought,
if Penelope can see me this way,

37:20.112 --> 37:21.447
then surely I can too.

37:22.531 --> 37:23.491
I was just

37:24.116 --> 37:26.911
so distracted by Miss Thompson.

37:27.954 --> 37:31.582
So I cleared my head,
swore off women and love, and…

37:32.458 --> 37:35.419
Well, I only wanted
to fully understand myself

37:35.503 --> 37:37.296
before stepping back into this world.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.258
You've sworn off women, then?

37:40.341 --> 37:42.009
Well, for the time being.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.303
I am a woman.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.681
You are Pen.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.599
You do not count.

37:49.475 --> 37:50.559
You are my friend.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.061
Of course.

37:52.812 --> 37:53.854
Your friend.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.107
How good to hear that.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.235
[melancholy music playing]

38:03.864 --> 38:06.033
[breathing shakily]

38:08.953 --> 38:10.871
[Cressida laughs softly] Thank you.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.082
Yes. I find it quite alluring too.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.166
[laughter]

38:14.250 --> 38:17.837
[Lady Cowper] The new Lord Featherington
is certainly a man of taste, is he not?

38:17.920 --> 38:18.879
Lady Cowper.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.089
Miss Cowper.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.801
What an exquisite necklace.

38:23.884 --> 38:26.012
Courtesy of
the new Lord Featherington, I hear.

38:26.095 --> 38:30.266
Oh. Did the lord not tell you?
He called on us just this afternoon.

38:30.349 --> 38:32.268
-I must have missed that.
-Hmm.

38:32.768 --> 38:36.939
I was so busy with Philippa's nuptials
and everything else. [chuckles]

38:37.023 --> 38:39.275
It's quite a generous gesture, is it not?

38:39.775 --> 38:41.736
I do wonder what it means.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.070
It cannot mean much.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.532
The new lord is
so very generous with his gifts.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.034
It's hard to keep up with them.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.577
-Hmm. Yes. Oh.
-[chuckles]

38:49.660 --> 38:51.495
[chuckles] This way, my dear.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.177
I saw that Gérard painting.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.095
-It was a marvel.
-A vision, in fact.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.681
So you are telling me
that he, Leighton, and Turner

39:10.765 --> 39:12.475
all studied in the same academy?

39:12.558 --> 39:14.935
Indeed. And they have
a vacancy, from what I hear.

39:15.770 --> 39:20.024
If you are serious about painting,
I hear it is the place to be.

39:20.107 --> 39:21.650
Brother. I need you.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.571
-I'm in the midst of a conversation.
-Outside, straight away.

39:27.281 --> 39:28.282
Excuse me.

39:33.245 --> 39:35.998
I need you to teach me
how to read that out loud.

39:36.832 --> 39:37.750
Byron?

39:38.250 --> 39:40.378
Did I strike you much harder
than I realized earlier?

39:40.461 --> 39:43.089
"There is a pleasure
in the pathless woods."

39:43.172 --> 39:44.382
Oh…

39:44.465 --> 39:47.802
"There is a rapture on the lon--"
How does one make that sound good?

39:48.302 --> 39:51.680
I'm afraid that is not possible.
That poem is the opposite of good.

39:51.764 --> 39:52.598
That's nonsense.

39:52.681 --> 39:55.684
I thought this sort of thing
was supposed to be your pleasure.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.062
Poetry, yes. Byron, heavens, no.

39:58.145 --> 39:59.897
Is not everyone supposed to love Byron?

39:59.980 --> 40:03.484
Many in our year at Cambridge
thought my poetry far superior to his.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.653
Does that mean yours
is more or less deceitful?

40:05.736 --> 40:06.779
-Deceitful?
-Mmm.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.073
Poetry is the opposite, Brother.

40:10.157 --> 40:13.994
It is the art of revealing
precious truth with words.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.079
[chuckles]

40:15.579 --> 40:18.541
[chuckles] Quite right, Brother.
You-- You're being serious?

40:18.624 --> 40:19.667
Mm-hmm.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.585
Good God. Good night.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.963
What is it, truly, to admire a woman?

40:26.340 --> 40:28.759
To look at her and feel inspiration.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.221
To delight in her beauty.

40:32.304 --> 40:35.850
So much so that all your defenses crumble,

40:36.392 --> 40:38.853
that you would willingly take on

40:38.936 --> 40:41.564
any pain, any burden for her.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.025
To honor her being…

40:45.693 --> 40:48.154
[sighs] …with your deeds and words.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.241
That is what the true poet describes.

40:54.368 --> 40:56.579
You should apply yourself
more often, Benedict.

40:59.165 --> 41:00.124
Write that down.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.796
"And on that cheek, and o-er that brow,"

41:05.880 --> 41:09.550
"So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,"

41:10.759 --> 41:13.721
"The smiles that win,
the tints that glow,"

41:14.346 --> 41:16.640
"But tell of days in goodness spent,"

41:17.141 --> 41:19.518
"A mind at peace with all below,"

41:20.269 --> 41:23.772
"A heart whose love is innocent!"

41:24.315 --> 41:25.983
[women softly exclaiming]

41:27.943 --> 41:30.488
Gentlemen, thank you all

41:30.571 --> 41:33.991
for the most splendid display
of your talents this evening.

41:34.074 --> 41:37.119
A memorable occasion, to be sure.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.079
[Anthony] Pardon me. Lady Danbury?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.957
Uh, Lord Bridgerton, I did not expect you.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.126
No, I seem to have
fallen off the guest list.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.044
Ah.

41:45.127 --> 41:47.087
Though you'd never deny
a young man you've known

41:47.171 --> 41:48.797
for 29 years the pleasure of your company?

41:49.465 --> 41:51.717
And neither would
your footman at the front door.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.136
Apologies, viscount.
You appear to be late again.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.222
We were bringing the evening
to a conclusion--

41:56.305 --> 41:57.890
Surely Miss Edwina has time for one more.

41:58.974 --> 42:01.310
I spent all evening crafting something.
An original.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.229
Would you like to hear it?

42:05.022 --> 42:06.315
Would everyone like to hear it?

42:06.398 --> 42:08.067
-Yes. Most definitely.
-Viscount.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.194
-Go on, then.
-Of course, Lord Bridgerton.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.241
[Lady Danbury scoffs]

42:21.956 --> 42:22.873
"What is it…"

42:23.624 --> 42:24.708
[clears throat]

42:24.792 --> 42:26.001
"…truly to admire a woman?"

42:27.711 --> 42:29.964
"To look at her and feel inspiration."

42:31.173 --> 42:32.967
"To delight in her beauty."

42:33.509 --> 42:37.096
"So much that all your defenses crumble,

42:37.179 --> 42:41.225
that you would willingly
take on any pain, any burden for her."

42:41.308 --> 42:42.476
"To honor…"

42:45.980 --> 42:46.855
"To hon…"

42:51.026 --> 42:53.028
[somber music plays]

42:58.826 --> 43:00.411
My apologies. I cannot do this.

43:04.540 --> 43:09.044
I cannot claim these words as my own.
They are someone else's entirely.

43:10.879 --> 43:13.090
Truth be told, I'm not-- [sighs]

43:13.173 --> 43:15.050
[exhales] I'm not a man of poetry.

43:17.177 --> 43:20.848
Words of flattery are beautiful and sweet,

43:20.931 --> 43:22.433
but they are also hollow

43:23.225 --> 43:24.768
unless accompanied by action.

43:27.021 --> 43:30.024
Miss Edwina, I could stand here
and pretend to be someone I am not.

43:30.107 --> 43:33.277
I could pretend to want the very same
things as you, but I'd be lying.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.946
I may not be able to…

43:38.407 --> 43:40.492
offer the display of passion

43:41.327 --> 43:42.786
that you truly deserve.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.791
But I assure you
that when it comes to action and duty…

43:49.835 --> 43:51.712
I shall never be found lacking.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.006
And I hope that

43:54.757 --> 43:57.635
is what will speak louder
than any pretty words ever can.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.648
-[soft murmuring]
-[scattered clapping]

44:12.066 --> 44:15.527
Did you hear that, Bon?
He cannot give you the love you deserve.

44:15.611 --> 44:18.405
Does that make him
a bad man or an honest one?

44:19.073 --> 44:21.450
It is the mark of a true gentleman,

44:21.533 --> 44:23.869
just as Appa used to say.

44:24.578 --> 44:25.454
Yes?

44:53.649 --> 44:54.692
Delicious.

44:59.238 --> 45:01.240
-[grunts]
-[people gasping]

45:13.877 --> 45:15.713
[Lady Danbury]
You should return to the party.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.339
I shall be there in a moment.

45:17.423 --> 45:20.509
Well, the viscount
certainly seems to have nettled you.

45:21.635 --> 45:23.262
He can be exasperating.

45:23.345 --> 45:25.764
He is incorrigible.
He is not for my sister.

45:25.848 --> 45:28.892
I shall make sure
she sees of it too, one way or another.

45:29.893 --> 45:31.729
Some advice, Miss Sharma?

45:32.479 --> 45:34.732
When one is frustrated,

45:34.815 --> 45:39.528
it is often much wiser to focus
upon satisfying one's own needs.

45:39.611 --> 45:43.907
Attempting to influence others
as to the correct course of action, well,

45:43.991 --> 45:46.994
it is often a trying
and irritating endeavor

45:47.077 --> 45:48.495
that only brings out the worst in us

45:48.579 --> 45:51.999
before we discover
it has been fruitless all along.

45:52.082 --> 45:54.918
I am aware I've made a fool
of myself tonight, Lady Danbury.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.296
I do not need to hear it from you.

45:57.379 --> 45:59.631
In fact, I do not need
to hear it from anyone.

46:00.507 --> 46:03.343
I do not care
what a single person here thinks of me.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.556
Once Edwina is married,
I shall return home alone,

46:07.639 --> 46:11.059
only too glad
to never set foot in this city again.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.730
You may not yet know,
and that is all well and good.

46:14.813 --> 46:18.108
But I, for one,
find it not only terribly disheartening

46:18.192 --> 46:20.194
but also an offense against truth,

46:20.277 --> 46:23.322
to hear you say you wish to be alone

46:23.405 --> 46:26.033
at a mere six and twenty?

46:26.116 --> 46:28.660
Perhaps you should not.
I will be a governess.

46:28.744 --> 46:31.205
I will be content knowing
my sister is taken care of.

46:31.288 --> 46:32.247
Content?

46:33.081 --> 46:34.750
Are you so miserable, my lady?

46:34.833 --> 46:36.627
I beg your pardon?

46:36.710 --> 46:38.337
Are you not alone yourself?

46:38.420 --> 46:41.173
I watch you. I see you.
You are more than content.

46:41.256 --> 46:45.511
Because I have lived a life.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.930
I am a widow.

46:48.639 --> 46:51.683
I have loved. I have lost.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.477
I have earned the right

46:53.560 --> 46:56.104
to do whatever I please,
whenever I please,

46:56.188 --> 46:58.690
and however I please to do it.

46:58.774 --> 47:00.025
Child,

47:00.734 --> 47:02.986
you are not me.

47:03.695 --> 47:06.573
And if you continue down this road,

47:06.657 --> 47:09.243
you most certainly never will be.

47:11.119 --> 47:13.747
[Lady Whistledown]
There are two things that lurk

47:13.831 --> 47:16.750
within the dark
and shadowy places of our fair city.

47:16.834 --> 47:20.379
Vermin and secrets.

47:20.462 --> 47:25.092
I shall leave it to you, dear reader,
as to which do the most harm.

47:25.175 --> 47:26.051
[sighs]

47:26.802 --> 47:30.514
[Lady Whistledown] One has to wonder
what secrets the season's diamond

47:30.597 --> 47:33.225
is holding near and dear to her heart.

47:33.308 --> 47:36.270
And who shall she choose
to share them with?

47:36.353 --> 47:38.772
The Viscount Bridgerton, perhaps?

47:39.690 --> 47:42.067
At least the elder Sharma's opinion

47:42.150 --> 47:46.488
on such a matter
is certainly no secret at all.

47:53.996 --> 47:57.708
If you are truly that vexed by the manner
in which Lady Whistledown writes still,

47:57.791 --> 47:59.167
perhaps you might stop reading?

47:59.251 --> 48:01.712
-She's finally revealed herself.
-What? El--

48:01.795 --> 48:03.755
I was not going to tell you this because--

48:03.839 --> 48:06.508
Well, I was embarrassed,
and I thought I was wrong, but,

48:07.092 --> 48:09.052
I paid this printer's shop
a visit yesterday.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.345
You did?

48:11.930 --> 48:13.765
Did you speak with anyone?

48:14.391 --> 48:16.476
It does not matter. Pen, look.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.271
Not only are these paper stocks identical,

48:19.354 --> 48:22.816
but the letter K's, they are slightly
misshapen in the exact same way.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.360
Surely it is not likely
to be another coincidence.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.529
Well, we must keep an eye out.

48:28.322 --> 48:30.407
If the same mistake
is in Whistledown's next issue,

48:30.490 --> 48:32.868
then we will know
the print shop is indeed hers.

48:32.951 --> 48:35.412
[compelling music plays]

48:35.495 --> 48:37.497
[indistinct chatter]

48:50.218 --> 48:52.763
[in Irish accent]
A new letter "K" for a Stanhope press.

48:52.846 --> 48:56.058
-That will be ten pence.
-I'll give you five.

48:56.141 --> 48:59.394
Five's a special rate
for repeat customers.

48:59.478 --> 49:02.731
Trust me, friend, I'd exasperate you
coming back any more than once.

49:02.814 --> 49:06.026
Now give me the discount to keep me away,
and we'll both be happier.

49:13.825 --> 49:14.993
Miss Penelope?

49:16.036 --> 49:19.289
[Lady Whistledown]
To be fair, one might call this author

49:19.373 --> 49:22.250
the biggest secret-sharer of all.

49:22.334 --> 49:26.755
For who else could possibly
keep all of you honest?

49:27.339 --> 49:29.132
Here you are, Your Majesty.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.093
And you are certain

49:31.176 --> 49:34.012
these are the young ladies our diamond
has been conversing with of late?

49:34.096 --> 49:35.430
Yes, Your Majesty.

49:35.514 --> 49:36.974
If our theory is correct,

49:37.057 --> 49:40.394
then Lady Whistledown
will indeed be in this very collection.

49:42.229 --> 49:45.732
[Lady Whistledown]
When even the most well-kept of secrets

49:45.816 --> 49:48.986
must eventually come to light.
