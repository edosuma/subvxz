they were nevertheless
very popular

06:13.941 --> 06:15.707
because they were cheap

31:05.264 --> 31:08.966
<i>Pigeons can use

31:08.968 --> 31:11.401
<i>and landmarks as a map.</i>

31:11.403 --> 31:13.570
They even use
the Earth's magnetic field.

31:13.572 --> 31:17.140
So, was it possible
that these birds detected

31:17.142 --> 31:19.710
the electrical surge
before it happened?

31:20.812 --> 31:22.913

31:28.387 --> 31:30.087
<i>before the explosion</i>

31:30.089 --> 31:32.456
<i>forewarning them of the event.</i>

31:32.458 --> 31:34.458
[explosion]

31:34.460 --> 31:36.226
Also out of the blue,
it was like they all

31:36.228 --> 31:37.895
of a sudden scatter
and they disperse,

31:37.897 --> 31:40.731
<i>and it's right before
we see this big explosion</i>

31:40.733 --> 31:41.865
<i>on the power line.</i>

31:41.867 --> 31:43.834
[explosion]

31:43.836 --> 31:45.836
So would you think
that maybe there is some type

31:45.838 --> 31:47.404
of signal running down
this cable

31:47.406 --> 31:49.806
that these birds can detect?

31:49.808 --> 31:51.675
<i>[narrator] Wallace has
set up a power line</i>

31:51.677 --> 31:54.945
<i>through which he will run
20,000 volts of electricity.</i>

31:56.014 --> 31:58.715
<i>He'll then generate
an electrical power surge</i>

31:58.717 --> 32:01.118
<i>in the line using a ground stick</i>

32:01.120 --> 32:04.087
<i>to see if it creates
an electromagnetic field</i>

32:04.089 --> 32:06.423
<i>that a flock of birds
could react to</i>

32:06.425 --> 32:08.492
<i>like they do in the footage.</i>

32:08.494 --> 32:09.893
[explosion]

32:12.797 --> 32:16.433
All right. So we are energized
at 20,000 volts.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.834
Let's apply ground.

32:26.577 --> 32:28.812
<i>[narrator] After Wallace
creates the surge,</i>

32:28.814 --> 32:30.847
<i>he checks his oscilloscope.</i>

32:30.849 --> 32:32.883
Okay. Now this is perfect.

32:32.885 --> 32:34.718
<i>[narrator] This shows him
the sudden increase</i>

32:34.720 --> 32:36.687
<i>in electric fault current
that was produced</i>

32:36.689 --> 32:39.022
<i>when he touched the power
line with the ground stick.</i>

32:39.024 --> 32:40.557
If you look on my screen here,

32:40.559 --> 32:42.526
you get a wonderful
representation

32:42.528 --> 32:44.594
of voltage,
which is your blue lines,

32:44.596 --> 32:46.930
everything's going 20,000 volts.

32:46.932 --> 32:49.232
And then right up in here
where I get ready to start

32:49.234 --> 32:51.735
making the contact,
you start getting these purple

32:51.737 --> 32:53.570
pulses coming down.

32:53.572 --> 32:54.905
And you get big spikes.

32:54.907 --> 32:56.907
So right here is where
I'm making my contact.

32:56.909 --> 32:59.376
See this big pulse
of the purple going?

32:59.378 --> 33:00.577
That's an indication

33:00.579 --> 33:02.112
that we're starting
to draw current.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.081
So the electromagnetic field
is going to start

33:04.083 --> 33:05.449
getting greater at this point.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.517
So therefore, this would be
the area that a bird

33:07.519 --> 33:10.487
could possibly sense, "Hey,
something's fixing to happen,"

33:10.489 --> 33:12.723
and give them
a moment's notice to fly away

33:12.725 --> 33:14.391
before disaster hits.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.762

<i>would be able to take action
and fly away</i>

33:21.200 --> 33:23.400
<i>before the lethal

33:25.003 --> 33:28.872
<i>A 2018 study by the
Lund University in Sweden,</i>

33:28.874 --> 33:31.708
<i>found that birds
might sense electromagnetism</i>

33:31.710 --> 33:33.944
<i>through a protein
called cryptochrome</i>

33:33.946 --> 33:36.279
<i>inside their eyes.</i>

33:36.281 --> 33:39.149
<i>Scientists found the sense
seems to get stronger</i>

33:39.151 --> 33:42.552
<i>when there is more blue light

33:42.554 --> 33:45.522
<i>This footage was taken

33:45.524 --> 33:47.491

33:47.493 --> 33:50.260
<i>they may not have been so lucky.</i>

33:50.262 --> 33:52.796
And as the old saying goes,
"The early bird gets worms,"

33:52.798 --> 33:55.799
well, maybe if these smart
birds can sense this field,

33:55.801 --> 33:57.134
they get away alive.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.870
If these birds did know
that this explosion

33:59.872 --> 34:02.239
was going to happen
before it did,

34:02.241 --> 34:03.507

<i>Chinese authorities claim</i>

41:12.737 --> 41:15.138
<i>the mysterious object
is shot further away</i>

41:15.140 --> 41:17.207
<i>from the dam
than originally claimed.</i>

41:17.209 --> 41:19.976
<i>The say it's just
a large black mesh bag</i>

41:19.978 --> 41:21.311
<i>that fell into the water.</i>

41:21.313 --> 41:22.812
<i>It's life-like movement</i>

41:22.814 --> 41:24.547
<i>caused by the powerful currents,</i>

41:24.549 --> 41:27.851
<i>which can flow it over
70,000 cubic feet per second.</i>

41:29.186 --> 41:31.087
<i>If there have been
more secrets spills</i>

41:31.089 --> 41:32.989
<i>of chemical mutagens
in the river</i>

41:32.991 --> 41:36.092
<i>causing marine creatures
to grow to massive sizes,</i>

41:36.094 --> 41:39.262
<i>the danger may not be
limited to animals.</i>

41:39.264 --> 41:42.499
<i>Millions of people in China
rely on the Yangtze River</i>

41:42.501 --> 41:45.068
for drinking water
and to wash their clothes.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.170
It's very possible
they're being exposed

41:47.172 --> 41:48.705
to dangerous chemicals.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.406
<i>Whatever this creature is,</i>

41:50.408 --> 41:52.742
<i>people living in this area
may be in danger</i>

41:52.744 --> 41:54.944
because whatever
is affecting it in the water,

41:54.946 --> 41:56.779
may also be affecting them.
