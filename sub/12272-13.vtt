00:02.700 --> 00:03.300
<i>MAN: I would never</i>

00:03.300 --> 00:04.600
hit my kids.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.700
'Cause, you know,
my father used to beat me.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.600
Whatever. He didn't beat me
too much.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.400
He beat me just right.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.700
I remember the last time
he really slapped me around

00:12.700 --> 00:14.900
just getting up off the ground
and thinking...

00:15.500 --> 00:16.600
perfect.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.900
He really nailed it,
you know just...

00:18.900 --> 00:20.800
Any more would have been
barbaric.

00:21.000 --> 00:21.800
And yet any less,

00:21.800 --> 00:24.200
I wouldn't be seeking
the approval of you drunks.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.600
So, thanks, Dad.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.900
'Cause parenting is hard
and expensive.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.500
I just read the other day
if you were to have a baby today

00:30.500 --> 00:32.900
and raise that kid all the way
through college,

00:32.900 --> 00:35.900
it would cost you $1 million.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.600
And that's why I feel like
no woman should ever walk out

00:38.600 --> 00:41.400
of an abortion clinic with her
head hung down in shame.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.500
You walk out and they're like
you just hit the lotto.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.400
I'm a winner!

00:45.500 --> 00:46.700
MAN:
You suck!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.400
You think abortion's funny?

00:49.600 --> 00:50.900
Hey, come on.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.100
I don't think abortion's funny.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.100
Especially the ones that try
too hard to get a laugh.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.200
You know what I mean?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.700
You'd know about that
wouldn't you?

00:59.900 --> 01:00.800
Sir,

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
do you have kids?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.100
That's none
of your damn business.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.200
I'm trying to connect, sir.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.600
I-I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.900
I hate to see that.

01:08.000 --> 01:08.900
Let me make it up to you.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.500
Let me baby-sit next week.

01:11.900 --> 01:12.400
Come on.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.300
Seriously. I love kids.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.700
Did you hug your kid today?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.100
Can I hug your kid?
Can I hug your kid, sir?

01:18.100 --> 01:20.500
You touch my kids, I kill you.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.200
Dude, it's a comedy show.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.300
I'm kidding.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.600
This is a joke.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.200
What? What was that?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.300
Oh, I see why you're so angry.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.500
That's your wife.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.200
Whoo!

01:35.700 --> 01:36.500
Hey, baby.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.300
The kids asleep?

01:38.600 --> 01:39.800
How's Katie's stomach?

01:40.500 --> 01:41.600
Do you need anything?

01:42.400 --> 01:45.000
Okay, all right, I'll see you
in like 15 minutes.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.300
All right. Love you.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.300
Hey man, you were great!

02:08.699 --> 02:10.300
- Thanks.
- No, no,

02:10.300 --> 02:11.400
I mean it, man.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.200
I was laughing my ass off.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.400
Anybody finds a size 54 ass,

02:15.400 --> 02:17.800
I'll make sure we keep it
on ice for you.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.300
He said 54 ass...

02:56.100 --> 02:57.700
I'll put up some screens.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.300
Don't bother.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.100
I'm going to take it
back intact.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.300
No rigor present.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.000
TOD is probably less
than 12 hours ago.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.900
Victim is a female child,

04:44.300 --> 04:47.200
Caucasian,
approximately

04:47.200 --> 04:49.500
three to four
years old,

04:49.800 --> 04:52.700
and she was found
in a packing box

04:53.800 --> 04:55.500
in a parking lot
at the intersection

04:55.500 --> 04:57.800
of Cordelia
and Tamsin Streets.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.900
The box

05:01.900 --> 05:04.000
appears to be in
good condition,

05:04.300 --> 05:06.500
and shows no indications

05:08.300 --> 05:10.400
that the child struggled,

05:10.600 --> 05:11.500
which may suggest

05:11.500 --> 05:14.000
that she was unconscious
or even dead

05:14.000 --> 05:16.900
at the time she was placed
inside the box.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.900
ALS reveals no blood

05:23.800 --> 05:26.100
or bodily fluids on the box.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.600
There are
multiple hairs

05:41.700 --> 05:43.600
embedded in the packing tape.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
There is a viscous residue
on the underside

05:51.000 --> 05:52.400
of the box.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.300
The guy who found the box
said he's sure it wasn't here

06:02.300 --> 06:04.200
when he arrived
to do his set.

06:07.100 --> 06:07.900
You know it's
too bad

06:07.900 --> 06:10.500
that there's no exterior
surveillance cameras

06:10.500 --> 06:13.000
- on any of the businesses here.
- Mm-hmm.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.800
No skid marks,

06:15.300 --> 06:17.400
which means the box
was probably placed,

06:17.400 --> 06:19.700
instead of being tossed out
of a moving vehicle.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.600
Most likely
someone on foot.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.500
There's got to be hundreds
of shoe prints

06:24.500 --> 06:26.000
crisscrossing
this lot.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.000
Yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.300
I better get started.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.800
All right, all right, okay.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.800
This is an ongoing
investigation,

06:45.800 --> 06:50.000
we're not giving out any more
details at this time.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.200
All we're asking is anyone with
any information about this girl,

06:53.200 --> 06:56.000
to please come forward
and contact the authorities.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.000
Let...

06:57.600 --> 07:00.800
I'll answer the questions,
but one at a time, all right?

07:00.900 --> 07:01.500
Okay.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.800
captain brass,  Has anyone claimed
responsibility?

07:03.900 --> 07:04.700
No.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.900
REPORTER:
How old is the baby?

07:05.900 --> 07:07.700
Are you offering
any reward?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.500
<i>BRASS:
No. Not at this time.</i>

07:12.500 --> 07:14.200
She's got abrasions

07:14.200 --> 07:16.000
on the knuckles of both hands.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.100
Reddish blisters

07:20.900 --> 07:22.700
on both palms,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.800
and on her legs

07:25.900 --> 07:27.100
and buttocks.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.000
Bruises on her back,

07:29.000 --> 07:30.200
arms...

07:32.900 --> 07:34.200
...and base of
the skull.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.300
<i>Is there anything
you could tell us</i>

07:35.300 --> 07:36.800
- about the cause of death?
- Come on,

07:36.800 --> 07:39.900
like I said, this is an ongoing
police investigation.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.900
- I'm not going to comment about that.
- But do you suspect

07:43.900 --> 07:45.300
- foul play?
- She was found dead

07:45.300 --> 07:47.000
in a box in a parking lot.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.200
Draw your own conclusions.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.400
COD is atlanto-occipital
disarticulation,

08:09.400 --> 08:11.600
consistent with a single
blunt force trauma

08:11.600 --> 08:13.000
to the back
of the head.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.500
Any signs of
sexual trauma?

08:16.900 --> 08:17.900
No.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.500
Trace is running
the samples,

08:19.500 --> 08:22.100
but these burns are
most likely chemical.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.600
There's blistering in
the nasal passages

08:24.600 --> 08:26.900
and esophagus,
which indicates

08:26.900 --> 08:29.000
inhalation
of caustic fumes.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.400
There's four-and-one
bruising on both arms.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.900
Any indication
of previous breaks

08:36.900 --> 08:38.700
or healed injuries?

08:38.799 --> 08:42.000
Nothing to suggest a history
of prior abuse.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.300
Well, you don't need practice
to kill a kid.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.200
You got something?

08:58.000 --> 08:58.900
Jude.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.400
Patron saint
of the desperate.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.200
Yeah.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.500
He's got an alibi.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.400
Who abuses

09:08.400 --> 09:10.800
and murders a child

09:10.800 --> 09:13.400
and then tenderly
wraps them

09:13.700 --> 09:16.300
in a blanket and leaves them
in a parking lot?

09:16.500 --> 09:19.500
The disposition of the body
suggests contrition.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.700
Or remorse even.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.400
A kidnapping
gone wrong?

09:24.300 --> 09:26.900
Except, if she'd been taken, the
parents would have come forward.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.200
Not necessarily.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.200
Maybe she was taken
a while ago.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.300
Grabbed somewhere else,
dumped here.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.100
Maybe her parents have stopped
looking for her.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.200
Unless the parents are involved.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.500
Abusive husband kills daughter,

09:43.500 --> 09:46.900
guilt-stricken wife gives
her a "decent" burial.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.500
Or maybe the
killer's just

09:49.500 --> 09:52.000
sticking his thumb in God's eye.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.600
Or practicing to
be a mortician.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.200
Or...

09:55.200 --> 09:57.000
Got your chemical
burn agent:

09:57.200 --> 09:58.600
it's sodium hydroxide

09:59.100 --> 10:01.900
with traces of machined
aluminum shards.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.300
Household drain
cleaner.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.200
The powdered hydroxide
reacts with water

10:06.200 --> 10:08.000
to generate near-boiling
temperatures,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.200
which in turn
churns up the shards

10:10.200 --> 10:13.300
which cut the hair and the gunk
to help break up the clog.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.500
WILLOWS:
And it burns like hell

10:14.500 --> 10:16.100
if it even touches
your skin.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.400
It's hard to believe that
anybody could do something

10:20.400 --> 10:22.600
like this to such
a beautiful little girl.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.800
So, if she had been
plain or homely,

10:27.300 --> 10:28.800
it'd be easy for
you to accept?

10:29.700 --> 10:30.700
No.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.700
But, uh,

10:34.100 --> 10:35.500
maybe it's just me,

10:35.800 --> 10:37.300
that when something
like this happens

10:37.300 --> 10:39.700
to a kid with a face
like that, it...

10:40.300 --> 10:42.100
just seems a little
more tragic.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.300
Maybe that'll work
in our favor.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.900
Did I just piss her off?

10:54.400 --> 10:55.300
Yeah.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.300
But she was heading that way
when she came in.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.600
<i>NEWSCASTER:
Sadly, there is perhaps nothing</i>

11:00.600 --> 11:03.000
that brings together
a community more quickly

11:03.000 --> 11:04.600
than the loss of a child.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.300
And it is clear that Las Vegans
have been profoundly moved

11:07.300 --> 11:10.900
by the death of a little girl
known only as Baby Cordelia.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.600
If you have any information
on her identity

11:13.600 --> 11:16.100
or the circumstances surrounding
this case, please call

11:16.100 --> 11:20.900
the L.V.P.D.
at 1-800-555-0133.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.800
That work for you?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.500
Nah, a little bit more
to the left.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.400
My left or...?

11:34.700 --> 11:35.500
No, no, you know what?

11:35.500 --> 11:37.600
Never mind, that's,
that's perfect.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.500
Walk away.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.200
Uplink's pretty good.

11:56.700 --> 11:59.100
We should be able to see it all
from the comfort of the lab.

11:59.900 --> 12:00.800
I've seen a lot
of these shrines

12:00.800 --> 12:02.400
over the years.
I don't think I've left

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
any flowers at any of them.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.300
It's hard for most
people to mourn

12:05.300 --> 12:07.100
for somebody they
didn't even know.

12:07.900 --> 12:08.900
The only one
I'm interested in

12:08.900 --> 12:12.300
is the guy who has a real reason
to be leaving flowers.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.400
Okay.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.100
This one has a tag.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
And now...

12:27.200 --> 12:28.200
tag, you're it.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.700
Is that what passes for
DNA humor around here?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.400
Never thought
I'd miss Sanders.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.300
Hair is inconsistent
with the vic's.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.200
Mark that as unknown.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.300
Okay.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.300
Well, that's odd.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.500
What?

12:50.500 --> 12:51.300
Grissom!

12:53.300 --> 12:54.500
What's our rule, Dave?

12:54.800 --> 12:55.500
"It better be good,"

12:55.500 --> 12:57.800
and this is. See?

12:59.700 --> 13:00.400
The vic's blonde hair

13:00.400 --> 13:02.900
has a very short,
dark root.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.900
The baby's not a natural blonde.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.600
Who dyes a toddler's hair?

13:09.100 --> 13:09.900
The undyed portion

13:09.900 --> 13:13.700
of the hair shaft
is 0.90 millimeters.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.600
Which indicates?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.300
- Well...
- Wendy?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.500
Well... human hair grows

13:20.500 --> 13:22.700
at an average rate
of half a millimeter a day,

13:23.100 --> 13:26.400
with a slight deviation
for age and for health.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.400
So based on the length
of that hair root,

13:29.400 --> 13:31.000
I would say that her hair
was probably dyed

13:31.000 --> 13:32.400
within the last...

13:34.100 --> 13:35.900
48 to 72 hours.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.500
Very good.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.700
Do you have a cross-section?

13:39.900 --> 13:40.900
Of course.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.000
Naturally curly hair,

13:46.100 --> 13:48.100
the sheath is flat
like a ribbon.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.100
But this cross-section,
the sheath is round.

13:52.900 --> 13:53.700
So?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.100
Well, the girl
that we're looking at

13:56.100 --> 13:58.200
has naturally
straight, brown hair.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.500
So maybe
she was abducted.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.100
And then, somebody curled
and colored her hair

14:03.100 --> 14:04.800
to try to hide her identity.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.400
Nicely analyzed.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
<i>BRASS:
Nora O'Toole?</i>

15:11.200 --> 15:13.300
- Yes?
- I'm Detective Jim Brass,

15:13.300 --> 15:14.600
Las Vegas Police.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.100
This is Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.600
Can I help you with something?

15:18.800 --> 15:19.500
WILLOWS:
Yes.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.100
Did you receive
an Emmerdale 2100

15:22.100 --> 15:23.900
vacuum cleaner recently?

15:24.100 --> 15:25.000
Yeah!

15:25.400 --> 15:28.300
My mom gave it to me
for my birthday.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.100
It's here somewhere.
Come on in.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.100
It totally rocks.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.400
It's got this whole
electrostatic

15:33.400 --> 15:35.500
micron fiber filtration thingy.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.200
And it's, like,
30 percent quieter.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.900
Is it being recalled
or something?

15:38.900 --> 15:40.800
Isn't it weird to send cops
to do a recall?

15:40.800 --> 15:43.100
Oh, I know! Is it hot?

15:43.200 --> 15:45.600
- Did it fall off a truck?
- No, no.

15:45.700 --> 15:46.600
Nothing like that.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.200
What did you do with the box?

15:50.400 --> 15:51.600
The box?

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
- Hey, Dean!
- Yeah?

15:55.700 --> 15:57.900
What'd you do
with the box?

15:58.200 --> 15:59.500
What box?

15:59.800 --> 16:02.400
The box the vacuum cleaner
came in.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.000
These guys want to know
what you did

16:04.000 --> 16:05.700
- with the box.
- DEAN: I don't know.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.200
I probably threw it out
with the trash.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.100
That your husband?

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
Not yet.

16:11.700 --> 16:14.900
This is my fianc?
Dean James.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.200
Like James Dean,
only backwards.

16:17.300 --> 16:18.500
<i>You know,
Rebel Without a Cause,</i>

16:18.500 --> 16:20.900
he's more like
cause without a rebel.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.200
I made that up. Is that funny? I can't tell.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.900
Are you nervous about something?

16:25.100 --> 16:28.400
Me? No, that's
just my personality.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.900
I was born this way.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.300
Dean's the funny one.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.600
Say something funny, honey.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.400
I don't think these folks
are here for funny.

16:35.700 --> 16:36.500
You live here?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.800
Actually, I got
a place of my own.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.400
Not for long.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.000
Oh, you know, he spends all
of his time right here with me.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.600
Living in sin and loving
every minute of it!

16:45.600 --> 16:46.800
So, Mr. James,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
do you remember
what you did with the box?

16:50.100 --> 16:52.600
Sure. Yeah, I just chucked it
right out back.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.600
I think I got something.

18:00.700 --> 18:01.600
Got a hit?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.100
I don't know, maybe.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.500
JOHNSON:
Bashira Sayeed,

18:07.700 --> 18:10.000
born April 10, 2005.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.800
Parents are Lebanese,

18:12.300 --> 18:14.200
in the U.S. on a tourist visa.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.300
They lost her
in an amusement park

18:16.300 --> 18:18.400
in Nye County three weeks ago.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.400
- Think that's her?
- Could be.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.900
Height and weight
are about the same.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.500
Better bring the parents.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.500
Mr. and Mrs. Sayeed.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.800
My name is
Warrick Brown.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.000
Would you come
with me please?

18:40.900 --> 18:42.300
Yes, okay.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.300
I'm sorry for your loss.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.700
No, this is not our little girl.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.900
This is someone else's child.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.000
Hey, you're back!

19:50.000 --> 19:51.300
Find the box?

19:51.600 --> 19:53.600
Ooh, brought
reinforcements, huh?

19:54.100 --> 19:56.800
- Your boyfriend at home?
- Dean?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.100
Honey?

19:58.200 --> 19:59.500
These guys are back.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.900
Oh, hey, guys.

20:01.900 --> 20:02.800
Listen, I'm late for work...

20:02.800 --> 20:04.500
Leo Finley, you're
under arrest.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.900
- Hey!
- What are you doing?!

20:07.000 --> 20:08.700
Who's Leo Finley?!

20:08.800 --> 20:10.200
Let go of him!

20:10.800 --> 20:12.200
Tell them, Dean!

20:12.200 --> 20:13.900
Tell them who you are!

20:14.000 --> 20:16.500
Nora, baby, don't listen
to anything they tell you!

20:16.700 --> 20:18.600
Okay, I can explain everything!

20:22.800 --> 20:24.700
WILLOWS:
Nothing you say
will change the DNA, Leo.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.100
That's your hair in that box.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.800
I already explained that.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
The problem is, we
still don't believe you.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.300
Look, I told you.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.500
I opened the box for Nora,

20:32.500 --> 20:35.400
I assembled the vacuum cleaner,
and I threw it out back.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.100
My hairs must have gotten
stuck in it then.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.100
End of story.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.700
Why the alias, Leo?

20:40.100 --> 20:41.200
Who're you hiding from?

20:42.500 --> 20:45.300
All right, okay,
one night, ten years ago,

20:45.300 --> 20:46.900
I did a hit of Ecstasy,

20:47.200 --> 20:49.500
and I threw in a hit
of peyote for good measure.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.100
By the time morning rolled
around, I was so high

20:52.100 --> 20:55.000
I thought I was inside
a living cartoon.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.700
I went outside naked
and performed a joyous,

20:58.700 --> 20:59.900
impromptu dance

20:59.900 --> 21:02.400
to the Egyptian Sun God Ra.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.800
That sounds really beautiful.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.600
I'm sorry I missed it.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.500
Well, unfortunately,
20 preschoolers

21:08.500 --> 21:10.400
playing in the yard
next door didn't.

21:11.100 --> 21:11.600
I was convicted

21:11.600 --> 21:15.200
of lewd and lascivious behavior,
public nudity.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.000
They forced me to sign up
on Megan's List.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.000
And my life went
right down the crapper.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.200
I've been hounded out of every
neighborhood I've moved into.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.000
Got my tires slashed.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.300
Someone...

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
someone nailed
my cat to my door.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.100
I wouldn't worry about your cat.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.300
You've got bigger problems
right now.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
Who is she?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.100
She the one they found
the other night?

21:49.300 --> 21:52.000
Found dead in your box, Leo.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.200
The one that your vacuum
cleaner came out of.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.700
The one that you got
your arm hairs stuck in.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.100
I didn't have anything to do

22:00.450 --> 22:01.300
with that little girl.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.350
I never saw her
before in my life.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.500
You're living
in an unregistered apartment,

22:08.650 --> 22:11.950
under an assumed name,
in violation of your parole...

22:12.000 --> 22:13.800
No! That's not true!
I still have my own place...

22:14.100 --> 22:16.200
Which we're going to go through
with a fine-tooth comb.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.750
Your own fianc?doesn't
even know who you are.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.300
Please, please... You're not
going to tell her, are you?

22:21.700 --> 22:23.500
Let's say that ship's
already sailed.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.450
Put him in the tank.

22:28.250 --> 22:31.700
You've never...
done anything you've regretted?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.850
More than there are stars
in the sky.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.750
?????

22:36.000 --> 22:36.900
????

22:40.450 --> 22:41.850
????apartment,

22:41.900 --> 22:43.750
where he claims
he threw away the box;

22:43.800 --> 22:46.100
which, somehow ended up
three blocks north

22:46.350 --> 22:49.100
and two blocks east--
with Baby Cordelia dead in it.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.300
Do you really believe
he killed the girl

22:51.800 --> 22:55.000
and carried her five blocks
before dumping the body?

22:55.300 --> 22:58.100
In that neighborhood, who would
notice a guy carrying a box?

22:58.150 --> 23:00.700
Leo Finley was never even
charged with child molestation,

23:00.750 --> 23:02.000
let alone abuse.

23:02.350 --> 23:03.900
Sex offenders escalate.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.700
He has a reasonable
explanation why his hairs

23:05.750 --> 23:06.900
were in the box,

23:07.450 --> 23:08.850
and there was no evidence
of the victim

23:09.100 --> 23:10.650
at either
of his residences.

23:10.700 --> 23:11.600
I know.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.750
So why is he still in custody?

23:13.800 --> 23:16.650
Because he lied to us before,
and he's still lying now.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.600
<i>Analysis of the oily residue</i>

23:19.650 --> 23:20.800
from the cardboard box.

23:22.300 --> 23:22.950
It's oil.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.700
Yeah, mostly 10-W-40,
transmission fluid,

23:25.750 --> 23:27.550
a little bit of axle grease
and some dirt mixed in.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.100
Well, that could be from any
parking lot or street in town.

23:30.350 --> 23:33.600
Yeah, but site-specific    impurity levels could
narrow that down a bit.

23:34.350 --> 23:36.400
Let me know if you find
any suspicious oil slicks.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.400
Excuse me.

24:07.150 --> 24:08.050
Sir?

24:09.200 --> 24:10.000
How you doing?

24:10.800 --> 24:12.000
My name's Nick Stokes.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.600
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.000
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

24:15.300 --> 24:16.300
I'm innocent.

24:16.650 --> 24:18.850
Do you, uh,
recognize this?

24:19.650 --> 24:21.250
I see all kind of boxes, son.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.600
How about this guy?
Do you recognize him?

24:28.850 --> 24:30.100
I see what you driving at.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.000
This fellow brought a busted
cylinder head in here

24:34.050 --> 24:35.050
in that box, to be fixed.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.150
One of them get-
the-job-half-done-

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
then-bring-it-in-here-for-
me-to-fix-it kind of guys.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.100
You know the type?

24:40.500 --> 24:41.950
Thinks he good with tools.

24:42.050 --> 24:44.700
Hopeless.
Like a woman.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.750
Worse than a woman,
a woman you might expect...

24:46.800 --> 24:48.850
Do you remember what you did
with the box?

24:49.850 --> 24:52.150
I took the part, he
tossed the box outside.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.500
I got the paperwork
inside.

25:04.450 --> 25:05.650
He came in
last Thursday.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.900
Guy's name is, uh...
Dean James.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.450
Hey, that's like, uh,
like James Dean...

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
Only it's backwards.

25:12.550 --> 25:13.850
Yeah, right, we know.
Thanks, man.

25:15.150 --> 25:17.150
Okay, yeah, I didn't throw
the box out.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.850
I used it to take an engine part
to my mechanic. Okay?

25:20.050 --> 25:20.900
Why did you lie, Leo?

25:20.950 --> 25:22.700
Because I saw the thing
on the TV.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.500
It was you, in fact, saying
about how they found

25:25.550 --> 25:26.650
that dead kid out back there,

25:26.700 --> 25:27.650
and I-I thought you wouldn't
believe me

25:27.700 --> 25:29.600
if I told you I took the box
so close to the scene.

25:30.150 --> 25:30.950
You lied to us, Leo,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.700
and now you're changing
your story... again.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.500
What is it with you
and the truth, Leo?

25:36.100 --> 25:38.050
Look, I swear to God...

25:38.100 --> 25:39.950
And now we have both you
and the box

25:40.000 --> 25:41.600
within a hundred yards
of the scene

25:41.650 --> 25:43.500
on the night it happened.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.650
How do you think
that makes us feel?

25:46.200 --> 25:48.450
I... I used it
to take a part in.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.400
Talk to my mechanic.

25:50.650 --> 25:51.450
He'll tell you.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.650
We already have.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.800
So... what?
You think I...

25:55.250 --> 25:56.950
You think I brought the part in
and then...

25:57.400 --> 25:59.300
came back later and put
the little girl in the box?

25:59.350 --> 26:00.150
Does that make sense to you?

26:00.400 --> 26:02.600
What makes sense to me,
what doesn't make sense to me

26:02.650 --> 26:03.900
is none of your business.

26:04.700 --> 26:05.700
But I will tell you this:

26:05.900 --> 26:06.850
Every time I turn around,

26:07.150 --> 26:08.950
you get closer and closer
to the scene.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.700
Why is that, Leo?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.100
I don't know.

26:13.050 --> 26:13.850
Coincidence?

26:14.800 --> 26:16.200
So what's it going to be
next time?

26:18.550 --> 26:20.100
That... no,
that's the whole story.

26:20.150 --> 26:21.450
There's not going to be
a next time.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.050
Las Vegas police have exhausted
the few leads

26:29.100 --> 26:32.200
they had in the tragic case
of Baby Cordelia Doe;

26:32.350 --> 26:35.100
yet her identity and the
circumstances of her death

26:35.300 --> 26:36.350
remain a mystery.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.300
But desperate to find out
who she is

26:38.650 --> 26:41.900
and who killed her, forensic
experts have reconstructed

26:41.950 --> 26:43.450
the little girl's appearance

26:43.600 --> 26:45.950
as she would've looked
before she was murdered

26:46.000 --> 26:47.500
and left for dead.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.200
They're hoping the image
will look enough

26:50.300 --> 26:53.100
like the real girl to shake
loose someone's memory...

26:53.800 --> 26:54.600
That's my baby!

27:09.100 --> 27:11.900
That's my daughter!
That's my daughter!

27:12.000 --> 27:12.800
Get back!

27:25.500 --> 27:26.450
That's Inez.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.300
That is-is... my little girl.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.400
I wasn't there
to protect her.

27:36.550 --> 27:39.000
You guys put her
in the ground yet?

27:40.600 --> 27:41.400
Not yet.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.500
I would like to go
to the funeral.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
We might be able to arrange that.
Yeah.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.600
Do you know anyone
who wanted to harm her?

27:53.700 --> 27:56.350
Yeah... I know exactly
who did it.

27:57.100 --> 28:00.150
<i>It's the guy I used to share
my cell with-- Boyd Waldrip.</i>

28:00.550 --> 28:04.950
<i>I told him about my wife Grace,
what a good woman she was</i>

28:05.000 --> 28:08.400
<i>and how lucky I was
to have her.</i>

28:09.950 --> 28:11.050
<i>When Boyd got out,</i>

28:12.050 --> 28:15.850
I asked him to look
in on Grace and Inez...

28:17.000 --> 28:19.400
to take care of them
if they needed anything.

28:20.650 --> 28:22.100
He took care
of her all right.

28:22.750 --> 28:24.500
The bitch filed for divorce,
and...

28:24.750 --> 28:26.050
then she married Boyd.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.600
How could I have been so stupid?

28:31.700 --> 28:34.050
He killed Inez.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.150
He killed...

28:36.650 --> 28:38.400
my little baby girl. He...

28:40.500 --> 28:41.600
Why would he do that?

28:42.100 --> 28:42.900
I don't know.

28:42.950 --> 28:46.550
Maybe he did not want my face
staring up at him

28:46.700 --> 28:50.600
every morning, reminding him
what a piece of crap he was.

28:50.950 --> 28:51.900
Well, if he killed
your daughter,

28:51.950 --> 28:53.450
why didn't your wife
come forward?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.200
Maybe she's... dead, too.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.000
Maybe he killed her, too.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.100
When, uh, you guys
find him,

29:04.150 --> 29:05.500
will you send him
back down here?

29:05.550 --> 29:08.350
And then we'll save the state
a lot of money on him.

29:21.350 --> 29:22.650
LVPD! Open up!

29:27.800 --> 29:28.900
Clear!
Clear!

29:31.200 --> 29:33.550
Attention all officers,
attempt to locate white male,

29:33.850 --> 29:36.950
Boyd Waldrip, possibly
in the company of his wife,

29:37.000 --> 29:38.850
white female, Grace Waldrip

29:39.100 --> 29:41.650
and/or two young children,
descriptions to follow.

29:42.250 --> 29:45.300
Suspect's vehicle of record is
a yellow '78 Mercury Zephyr.

29:45.350 --> 29:49.200
Nevada tags: Zebra, George,
Nora, Paul, Three, Nine, Zero...

29:57.850 --> 30:00.950
Apparently when Waldrip got out,
he gained custody

30:01.000 --> 30:02.650
of his two kids
from a former marriage.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.100
First wife died of hepatitis
while he was inside.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.200
Maybe Inez's mother dyed
her hair

30:08.250 --> 30:11.000
so she'd fit in better
with her new siblings.

30:11.300 --> 30:12.700
Or else she was trying to make

30:12.750 --> 30:14.150
Inez look less like
her real father?

30:15.150 --> 30:16.300
To protect her?

30:20.850 --> 30:23.800
TV's still on, food
left on the table.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.150
They left in a hurry.

31:26.850 --> 31:28.250
<i>Tonight we have
new developments</i>

31:28.300 --> 31:30.550
<i>in the tragic death
of Inez Balboa,</i>

31:30.650 --> 31:31.700
<i>the child we've come to know</i>

31:31.750 --> 31:33.200
as Baby Cordelia Doe.

31:33.550 --> 31:36.800
Authorities are currently
engaged in a statewide manhunt

31:36.850 --> 31:39.000
for the child's mother
and stepfather...

31:39.200 --> 31:40.550
???

31:40.600 --> 31:41.400
If they're traveling
with their kids,

31:41.450 --> 31:42.450
they might be looking
for a place

31:42.500 --> 31:43.500
to leave them for awhile.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.650
Well, Waldrip has a sister
in Modesto,

31:45.950 --> 31:47.600
and Grace's mother lives
in Salt Lake City.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.550
We staked out both
of their residences.

31:50.150 --> 31:52.950
NHP is patrolling all the major
roads leading to them.

31:53.050 --> 31:53.850
Hold on a minute.

31:54.150 --> 31:55.050
Brass.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.200
I'm on my way.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.400
We got 'em.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.250
Boyd, listen!

32:14.150 --> 32:15.700
Let's find a way out of this.

32:16.850 --> 32:19.250
We've got to deal with the
safety of your kids first.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.300
We got
a hostage situation.

32:21.350 --> 32:22.900
A customer ID'd 'em
in there eating.

32:22.950 --> 32:23.750
They called the locals,

32:23.800 --> 32:26.300
but he burned us  and opened fire.
Anybody hit?

32:26.350 --> 32:28.450
I'm not sure. We got him
locked down there

32:28.500 --> 32:29.900
with his family
and some customers.

32:29.950 --> 32:31.550
How many inside?
I don't know.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.200
Nobody's been hurt yet;
nobody's gonna get hurt.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.400
That's the idea.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.400
That's the most important thing
right now, okay?

32:40.700 --> 32:42.050
Raise that camera higher.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.250
So why don't you work
with me here?

32:51.400 --> 32:53.000
Let's ease the kids out of this.

32:55.900 --> 32:56.700
Okay!

32:57.400 --> 32:58.750
Okay, I'm going to let
the kids out.

32:58.800 --> 32:59.650
Just put your weapons down.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.100
You got it, Boyd.

33:01.250 --> 33:02.050
Nice and easy.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.200
You're all right.
You're okay.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.100
Go.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.600
Come here, kids.
Come on.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.450
Let's get everyone else
out you got in there.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.200
They didn't do
anything, Boyd.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
You got
to let them out, too.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.400
Work with me
here, Boyd.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.600
We're gonna
work it out.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.150
All right, let's go.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.050
Come on, you guys go first.

33:40.350 --> 33:41.700
Let's go. Let's go.

33:41.850 --> 33:43.050
Come on, come on, come on!

33:43.400 --> 33:44.000
I'm letting you go.
Come on...

33:44.050 --> 33:44.850
They're coming out!

33:45.500 --> 33:46.300
Nice and easy.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.200
Go, go. Move,
move, move, move!

33:51.250 --> 33:52.050
All right, let's see this

33:52.100 --> 33:53.250
through to the end.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.700
Now, you've got a choice.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.900
You both can
come out together,

33:58.500 --> 34:00.200
or you can send your
wife ahead of you.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.600
Come on, you got to go.

34:02.650 --> 34:03.450
No! No!

34:03.500 --> 34:05.400
Come on. Listen to me.

34:05.650 --> 34:07.050
Don't argue.
You got to go.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.550
You're going.
No.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.850
Go, go, go.
I don't want

34:11.900 --> 34:12.750
to go without you!
Just go!

34:12.800 --> 34:13.650
Don't argue
with me.

34:15.350 --> 34:17.199
Hold you fire! Hold your fire!

34:17.250 --> 34:19.199
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

34:29.750 --> 34:32.949
??? then you locked her
under the sink.

34:33.449 --> 34:36.050
If you say I killed Inez,
that must have been how it was.

34:36.150 --> 34:38.350
You know, however you want
it put, that's fine with me.

34:39.000 --> 34:39.900
Oh.

34:40.300 --> 34:43.600
I-I'm just... I'm just trying
to do you justice here, Boyd.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.199
Just write it out,

34:45.750 --> 34:46.850
and I'll sign it.

34:47.050 --> 34:48.900
So, you're waiving your right
to counsel?

34:48.949 --> 34:50.600
I don't need no lawyer.

34:50.900 --> 34:51.699
It's over.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.150
Can we just get this thing done?

34:53.600 --> 34:55.100
All right.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.600
I want   my daddy!
Okay, come on.

34:59.700 --> 35:00.800
Just leave him alone!
Come with me now!

35:00.900 --> 35:03.300
I want my daddy!
He wants his daddy!

35:03.350 --> 35:04.200
It'll be okay.
Excuse me?

35:05.050 --> 35:06.400
Could you give me a minute
with them, please?

35:06.450 --> 35:07.250
Thank you.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.650
It's going
to be okay.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.300
But you got
to be brave.

35:15.050 --> 35:16.100
Can you do that?

35:17.200 --> 35:18.850
Is this because of us?

35:19.150 --> 35:20.600
No, no.

35:20.650 --> 35:21.600
No, it's not because of you.

35:21.650 --> 35:24.100
Is it because
of what happened to Inez?

35:24.750 --> 35:26.000
What do you think
happened to her?

35:27.100 --> 35:28.500
We were playing a game.

35:29.950 --> 35:30.650
A game?

35:30.700 --> 35:31.550
Hide and seek.

35:32.950 --> 35:33.950
Hide and seek?

35:34.400 --> 35:36.050
Dad was asleep on the couch.

35:39.550 --> 35:41.300
You said that you were playing
hide and seek?

35:41.950 --> 35:42.750
He was it.

35:43.150 --> 35:44.850
He found me right away, but...

35:45.550 --> 35:46.800
but Inez won.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.450
I showed her the best hiding
place in the whole house.

35:54.450 --> 35:57.050
Four, five, six,

35:57.100 --> 35:59.300
seven, eight,

35:59.400 --> 36:01.950
nine, ten, 11.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.600
12, 13...

36:14.450 --> 36:17.000
Did your dad tell you
to say this?

36:17.250 --> 36:20.400
No. You're not supposed
to wake Dad when he's sleeping

36:20.450 --> 36:22.400
because he gets tired a lot.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.600
Why don't you tell me
what really happened?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.400
You got my confession.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.150
Yes, but I don't believe
that's what happened anymore.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.750
I told you, that's how it was.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.150
Your kids are telling me
something different.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.200
It was an accident,
wasn't it, Boyd?

36:57.350 --> 36:58.150
All right,
think about this.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.450
Think about
your children.

37:01.150 --> 37:02.450
What would their lives be like

37:02.500 --> 37:04.700
with everyone believing

37:04.750 --> 37:05.900
that their father's a killer?

37:13.050 --> 37:15.250
I came home from work
like I always do,

37:15.400 --> 37:17.750
fell asleep on the couch,
waiting for Grace to get home.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.300
Where's your sister?

37:37.200 --> 37:38.000
Inez?

37:47.800 --> 37:49.200
<i>I went outside looking
for Grace,</i>

37:51.500 --> 37:52.400
but she had the car,

37:52.450 --> 37:53.850
she wasn't home from work yet.

37:59.000 --> 37:59.800
<i>I was scared.</i>

38:00.800 --> 38:01.800
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

38:05.100 --> 38:08.200
<i>So you're telling me that
you had your little girl</i>

38:08.250 --> 38:11.000
<i>in your arms
with her heart still beating,</i>

38:11.050 --> 38:13.100
<i>and you took the bus
to the hospital?</i>

38:13.700 --> 38:15.800
<i>I thought if I let her go,
she would die.</i>

38:17.150 --> 38:19.000
But she died anyway.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.750
If it was just an accident,

38:58.650 --> 38:59.900
why didn't you just report it?

39:03.750 --> 39:05.000
Look at who I am.

39:07.950 --> 39:10.450
If I reported her death,
who would have believed me, huh?

39:13.100 --> 39:13.800
At the very least,

39:13.850 --> 39:15.450
they would have taken
my children away from me,

39:15.500 --> 39:17.350
probably sent me back
to jail, too.

39:18.750 --> 39:20.050
What would the point
of that have been?

39:24.800 --> 39:26.550
She was dead, and...

39:28.250 --> 39:30.000
breaking up my family
and leaving my children

39:30.050 --> 39:31.750
without a daddy
wasn't gonna bring her back.

39:34.450 --> 39:35.250
So you ran?

39:38.650 --> 39:40.100
See how well that turned out.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.050
Catherine?

39:55.350 --> 39:56.250
You should see this.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.600
It seems they
loved her.

40:12.850 --> 40:14.150
I think it
makes it worse.

40:38.700 --> 40:39.600
Oh.

40:42.900 --> 40:43.700
What are you doing here?

40:44.050 --> 40:45.350
I was waiting for you.

40:47.900 --> 40:48.700
How did you get in here?

40:48.900 --> 40:50.500
Can't we talk about
something interesting?

40:51.200 --> 40:52.300
Me, for instance.

40:53.100 --> 40:53.900
I'm interesting.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.900
Yeah, let's do that.

40:56.000 --> 40:56.800
Let's talk about you.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.000
For starters, Nora left me.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.350
Actually, she threw my
stuff out in the street,

41:02.550 --> 41:04.750
got a restraining
order on me, notified

41:04.800 --> 41:05.950
the neighbors
and called my boss.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.300
"Hey, scumbag,
don't bother coming in.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.050
We'll mail you your last check."

41:11.800 --> 41:14.150
So, in one fell swoop,
as it were,

41:14.300 --> 41:16.500
I lost my girlfriend,
my livelihood

41:17.500 --> 41:18.550
and my place to live.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.950
I thought it was going to
be different this time.

41:24.450 --> 41:25.800
Frankly, I blame you.

41:27.250 --> 41:28.650
I didn't create
the circumstances

41:28.700 --> 41:29.550
of your life, Leo.

41:29.550 --> 41:31.850
You grind up the innocent
with the guilty.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.300
Just take it easy.

41:33.350 --> 41:34.650
I was just doing my job.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.750
I was just   doing my job?
Yeah, I was just

41:36.800 --> 41:38.300
doing my job.
I was just  doing my job.

41:38.350 --> 41:39.700
I was just
following orders.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.200
Blond Nazi bitch!

41:43.200 --> 41:44.100
You get in there

41:44.100 --> 41:46.550
with your big boots,
and you kick it all apart,

41:46.850 --> 41:48.500
and you don't care who you hurt,

41:49.200 --> 41:51.600
whose life you destroy
in the process.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.950
Calm down.
No.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.200
It's not fair!
Just calm down!

41:55.250 --> 41:56.500
Calm down...
Don't tell me   to calm down!

41:56.550 --> 41:59.050
Just stay back
and calm down.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.250
You're going
to shoot me?

42:02.350 --> 42:03.350
Would that help you to forget

42:03.400 --> 42:04.800
how completely
you screwed my life up?

42:05.450 --> 42:06.800
Would you sleep
better at night?

42:08.150 --> 42:09.900
Maybe I should just
save you the trouble

42:09.950 --> 42:11.100
and blow my own brains out, hmm?

42:11.550 --> 42:12.450
What do you think?

42:14.100 --> 42:15.600
I think you need
to talk to somebody.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.000
I am talking to somebody.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.400
I'm talking to you.

42:23.050 --> 42:24.250
So how about this?

42:24.500 --> 42:26.100
If I do decide to kill myself,

42:26.150 --> 42:27.400
I'm going to come over
to your house

42:28.300 --> 42:30.300
and blow my brains out
right on your front lawn,

42:31.250 --> 42:32.350
as a gift to you

42:33.250 --> 42:34.550
and everything
you stand for.

42:36.350 --> 42:37.350
How does that work for you?

42:38.700 --> 42:58.000
