00:06.580 --> 00:10.140
# Do you want me on your mind

00:10.140 --> 00:15.380
# Or do you want me to go on

00:18.300 --> 00:24.220
# I might be yours
as sure as I can say

00:25.300 --> 00:30.380
# Be gone, be faraway

00:32.260 --> 00:35.460
# Ooh

00:39.660 --> 00:44.300
# Ooh

00:44.300 --> 00:48.740
# Mm. #

00:52.740 --> 00:54.540
Did you not hear me?

00:54.540 --> 00:56.220
You've got no authority over me.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.300
Now, I've said that I'm heading
home. Open the...

00:58.300 --> 01:00.060
We need to discuss the search you
just did.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.940
Oh, I see. I cannae do it now. I've
got to head home. I'm cat-sitting.

01:02.940 --> 01:04.220
You need to debrief us.

01:04.220 --> 01:05.420
Am I free to go or not?

01:05.420 --> 01:08.940
It will be easier for everyone if
we can find a way to co-operate.

01:08.940 --> 01:11.460
So, you're not detaining me. OK.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.420
Gate, now.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.940
I need to get him out. The tunnel's
filling with nitrogen!

01:39.940 --> 01:41.300
He'll suffocate.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.740
Come on, Come on!

01:49.740 --> 01:52.700
Ready. OK, three, two, one, lift.

01:55.420 --> 01:56.980
Quicker, quicker!

02:08.260 --> 02:09.860
Move it!

02:09.860 --> 02:12.020
Right, get him on to the bed.

02:12.020 --> 02:13.620
Come on, quickly.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.900
That's it. Get him laid down.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.700
He was caught in the nitrogen burst.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.340
He'll be all right, won't he, doc?

02:20.340 --> 02:21.620
We'll have to wait and see.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.980
You'll be all right, mate.

02:30.260 --> 02:32.860
Emergency battery engaged.
Power restored.

02:32.860 --> 02:34.100
Sir?

02:34.100 --> 02:36.100
Report. What the hell just happened?

02:36.100 --> 02:38.220
The reactor was running perfectly.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.780
There was no signs of any problems
and then it scrammed.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.900
An emergency shutdown but without
the emergency,

02:42.900 --> 02:44.300
at least not one that we can find.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.340
I've lost one coolant pump before,
but this...

02:46.340 --> 02:47.580
Can you give us a likely cause?

02:47.580 --> 02:50.220
We're checking the coolant pump
breakers now, but they seem OK.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.020
I've got all hands on deck but I'm a
man down.

02:52.020 --> 02:53.620
Walsh was injured in the nitrogen
burst.

02:53.620 --> 02:56.180
Sir, how are things looking on the
roof, if we need to run the diesels?

02:56.180 --> 02:58.820
Surface weather? Wind blowing 40
knots, wave height 20 feet,

02:58.820 --> 03:00.980
low southerly swell.
Surface contacts?

03:00.980 --> 03:03.700
It's very noisy up there, sir. Maybe
four or five merchantmen on.

03:03.700 --> 03:07.060
No, not maybe. It's four or five.
Determine the facts, then report.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.980
Aye, aye, sir. All drills cancelled.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.180
Cox and brief the crew to secure
everything

03:11.180 --> 03:13.580
for surface running in rough
weather. Aye, aye, sir.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.020
Sir.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.620
And get rid of her.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.700
If the batteries run out,
how long have we got on the diesels?

03:20.700 --> 03:23.900
I mean, we'll be getting towed home.
We can't make it back to port.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.220
Prentice, prepare a plan

03:25.220 --> 03:27.380
for possible at sea diesel
replenishment. Aye, aye, sir.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.580
How long have our batteries got?
We're checking them now.

03:29.580 --> 03:30.980
Maybe three hours. Three h...?

03:30.980 --> 03:33.580
Capacity's well down on what it
should be. They need replacing.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.420
Yes, well, everything needs
replacing.

03:35.420 --> 03:36.700
The reactor supplies the power.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.300
We can run off batteries for a few
hours,

03:38.300 --> 03:40.060
but then, we'd have to use the
backup diesels,

03:40.060 --> 03:42.460
which means going to the surface and
sticking up a periscope.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.620
Sir, is this a drill? No, it's no
drill, stow for sea.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.460
Shake everyone in your bunk space.
Aye, sir.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.140
It's a nightmare staying below the
surface at periscope depth.

03:49.140 --> 03:50.540
The exhaust leaves smoke trails

03:50.540 --> 03:53.220
and the noise lights you up like a
Christmas tree. Watch it!

03:53.220 --> 03:54.300
Lads, get this stowed!

03:54.300 --> 03:56.420
So, what happens if the reactor
doesn't re-start?

03:56.420 --> 03:58.220
Then, what, we're in some kind of
danger?

03:58.220 --> 04:00.660
No, only if the motor gives out. But
we've been running on batteries.

04:00.660 --> 04:02.380
What happens if the batteries
give out?

04:02.380 --> 04:04.460
Then, we sink, so fingers-crossed,
ey?

04:04.460 --> 04:06.420
I don't want us anywhere near the
surface -

04:06.420 --> 04:08.540
not if there's a chance we're being
shadowed.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.620
Three hours on batteries means you
have 2.5 hours to diagnose,

04:11.620 --> 04:13.460
fix and restart the reactor.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.900
Carry on. Aye, Captain.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.980
Cronin, signals log.

04:16.980 --> 04:19.380
I know Burke was dismissed the day
the trawler went down.

04:19.380 --> 04:20.540
Why?

04:20.540 --> 04:22.380
You're in charge of discipline,
aren't you?

04:22.380 --> 04:23.580
I've got less than two days,

04:23.580 --> 04:25.900
there's never going to be a better
time to ask questions, is there?

04:25.900 --> 04:28.860
OK. Yeah, if an officer puts someone
on charge, then, yes, I deal with
it.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.740
So, what happened with Burke when
the trawler sank?

04:30.740 --> 04:32.340
He picked an argument with his
superiors,

04:32.340 --> 04:34.620
it was a stupid thing to do.
Now, Amy, I've got to crack on.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.340
Look. Hey, there's a no-touching
rule -

04:36.340 --> 04:38.540
it applies to everyone without
exception. Sorry.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.300
Were you told to punish Burke?

04:40.300 --> 04:43.460
No, no. He died before I had a
chance to log it.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.940
What do you mean, "log it"?
It's all in the duty logbook.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.220
I'm going to leave you here

04:47.220 --> 04:50.100
because I can't do my work with you
asking these questions, OK?

04:50.100 --> 04:51.900
So, just tell me what "logged it"
means.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.100
It's where officers report
disciplinary matters.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.180
I keep it in my office.

04:55.180 --> 04:57.100
Great. Can I see it?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.620
Yeah, it's in the grey file on top
of the cabinet.

05:01.780 --> 05:03.940
Keep breathing.
How long was he in there?

05:03.940 --> 05:05.740
Aw, I don't know, a minute.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.540
I think he's smacked his head.
No ESB mask on.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.980
I'm not dead. You can ask me.

05:11.980 --> 05:14.740
Lie still.
I need to take your clothes off.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.500
It's a tenner for watching.
And then I need to wash your hair.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.700
You what, ma'am? Right, scissors?

05:24.220 --> 05:25.660
Right, saline.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.900
Thank you.
Start dripping that into your eyes.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.180
I feel fine.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.460
Yeah, you might do for now,
but, in a few hours' time,

05:32.460 --> 05:34.940
we'll start to see whether your
lungs hold up.

05:34.940 --> 05:37.900
Good. Good. How is he?
It's too early to tell.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.500
You all right, Adams?

05:43.500 --> 05:47.060
Still not right, ma'am, my vision
keeps blurring. Right, you better
get to your bunk...

05:47.060 --> 05:49.460
No, no, no, no, no. I need every man
that I can get.

05:49.460 --> 05:51.100
The EPM's already tripped once.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.060
Our party has been clear.

05:55.060 --> 05:58.820
We do not want these
weapons in Scotland.

06:00.100 --> 06:03.660
Westminster is about to vote on
whether we should commission
new missiles,

06:03.660 --> 06:06.540
a vote we had to force
through, by the way,

06:06.540 --> 06:10.140
after this government tried to slip
this once-in-a-generation decision

06:10.140 --> 06:11.740
under the carpet...

06:11.740 --> 06:14.220
..without consulting parliament.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.340
Longacre speaking.
Evening, Longacre. It's Porter.

06:18.500 --> 06:22.340
You calling from the office?
Sounding a bit judgmental there.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.660
Got a name for one of guys who beat
up Burke.

06:24.660 --> 06:27.620
I might need your help getting his
file off the Navy. Have you eaten?

06:27.620 --> 06:30.180
Nope. Do you fancy pizza?

06:54.540 --> 06:55.860
So you've got a name?

06:55.860 --> 06:59.660
Yes, Gary Walsh.
He's Burke's crew mate on Vigil.

06:59.660 --> 07:03.140
Apparently, him and one other guy
beat the crap out of Burke at the
local pub.

07:03.140 --> 07:05.780
Oh. Who was the other guy?
Don't know.

07:05.780 --> 07:09.220
Spoke to the bar staff. They all
knew Gary, but not the other
assailant.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.780
They're pretty sure he was Navy
though. Right, OK.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.500
So, "Walsh...

07:15.500 --> 07:17.820
"Gary." Let's see what we've got.

07:19.180 --> 07:22.620
Right, so no disci...
Ah, amazing, thank you.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.660
No disciplinaries or anything...

07:26.020 --> 07:28.140
And... OK, he has two brothers -

07:28.140 --> 07:30.180
one of them Navy as well.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.060
Dishonourably discharged.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.300
There's a flag here for
a younger brother, Sam.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.340
A record for shoplifting.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.980
And possession of heroin.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.220
 Wait a minute.

07:48.060 --> 07:50.100
Hello? Lieutenant
Commander Branning.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.220
This is DS Longacre. I'd like to
send a message to DCI Silva, please,

07:53.220 --> 07:55.620
as soon as possible. OK.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.740
Enter.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.100
Yes?

08:06.580 --> 08:08.140
Any news on the reactor?

08:08.140 --> 08:11.460
What, were you sent to investigate
our mechanical issues as well?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.860
I've been through
the Cox'n's logbook.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.500
You put Craig Burke on charge
the day before he died.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.620
Probably.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.380
Can you remember what that was for?

08:27.700 --> 08:29.740
This annotation references
the type of offence.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.740
"Reckless endangerment of
equipment."

08:31.740 --> 08:34.940
He put a full mug of coffee on top
of a narrowband sonar set.

08:34.940 --> 08:38.700
You also put Burke on charge on
days two and four of the patrol.

08:38.700 --> 08:41.660
You disciplined him more in a week
than the rest of the crew
put together.

08:41.660 --> 08:44.940
We have standards for a reason.
We have a duty to safeguard lives.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.620
So what did Gary Walsh
do on day six?

08:49.860 --> 08:51.540
There's no annotation there.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.020
Can't remember. I just want to know
if there's a reason why...

08:58.020 --> 08:59.980
What do you think I am doing here?!

09:01.300 --> 09:03.540
If we run on diesels
we will need to refuel at sea,

09:03.540 --> 09:05.980
or abandon the patrol,
which cannot happen.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.580
Do you have any idea how challenging
it is to get a boat this size

09:08.580 --> 09:12.900
to rendezvous with a refuelling
tanker whilst also trying to
remain undetected?

09:12.900 --> 09:16.300
Can you even begin to imagine
the tactical challenges?

09:16.300 --> 09:18.540
No, no, I didn't think so.

09:18.540 --> 09:19.820
Follow me.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.500
Sir, may I have a word?

09:27.500 --> 09:30.140
Go ahead. Detective Silva is
interfering with operations.

09:30.140 --> 09:33.300
I explicitly told her to go through
the Cox'n, which she has
chosen to ignore.

09:33.300 --> 09:37.180
I therefore think we need to confine
her to quarters. There's just one
thing to consider there -

09:37.180 --> 09:40.420
interfering with a police
investigation is an offence.
We are on patrol!

09:40.420 --> 09:44.140
You can't just wade in here
and start taping off the bloody
control room! All right.

09:44.140 --> 09:47.540
DCI Silva, we're on backup power.
Several areas of the boat are unlit.

09:47.540 --> 09:50.380
As much as anything, it's hazardous
for you to be without an escort.

09:50.380 --> 09:54.420
Now I won't confine you to quarters,
but you will have to have Glover
with you if you're going to work.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.740
Will you put him at my disposal?
Negotiate that with him. Carry on.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.660
That means get out of his sight.
XO, enough.

10:03.820 --> 10:07.180
Cronin, escort DCI Silva to the
Cox'n's office. Aye, sir.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.740
Oh, shit, Cat!

10:37.580 --> 10:38.780
Hello?

10:44.540 --> 10:45.980
Emergency services.

10:45.980 --> 10:49.100
Which service...? Police. I'm a
police officer. Connecting you now.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.540
This is Detective Kirsten Longacre,
calling from Flat B,

10:51.540 --> 10:54.060
2 McMillan Street, West End.

10:54.060 --> 10:57.180
I think I've been burgled
and they might still be here.

11:01.420 --> 11:04.020
Police. I'm a police detective
There are more officers...

11:09.700 --> 11:11.660
Get off!

11:27.740 --> 11:29.820
 Let's go, let's go!

11:55.980 --> 11:57.220
You have 20 minutes.

11:58.780 --> 12:01.180
30 if I ask nicely?
It'll do you no harm.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.780
Message for you, ma'am. Thank you.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.540
 "Found witness
to Burke assault." Oh, eyes up.

12:07.900 --> 12:11.540
"Burke badly hurt.
Gary Walsh is perp.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.500
"Burke not pressed charges.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.780
"Gary Walsh's brother, Sam Walsh,
criminal record for possession."

12:17.780 --> 12:19.780
I need to search Gary Walsh's bunk.

12:37.980 --> 12:40.900
What you doing, stealing his sweets?
Testing for heroin.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.580
It was Gary Walsh who beat
Burke up in that pub.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.300
Did you know that?
I knew they didn't like each other.

12:52.300 --> 12:56.060
And there's a blank entry under
Gary Walsh in the logbook -

12:56.060 --> 12:58.260
that anything to do with him
and Burke? I don't know,

12:58.260 --> 13:00.780
you'd have to ask Prentice. Yeah...

13:01.900 --> 13:02.940
Tried that.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.500
You've checked Burke's bunk
already, haven't you?

13:10.500 --> 13:11.700
Could you?

13:13.180 --> 13:15.700
I'm looking for Burke's fleece.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.700
Hadlow said Burke was wearing
a green fleece,

13:17.700 --> 13:19.300
that's how he knew he was off duty,

13:19.300 --> 13:21.860
but Burke wasn't wearing a fleece
when we examined him, so...

13:21.860 --> 13:24.100
No, it's not there.
Why is that important?

13:24.100 --> 13:26.420
You only get rid of it
if you knew it incriminated you,

13:26.420 --> 13:29.300
like it had your blood on it,
or something.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.980
You can't throw things
away down here, can you?

13:31.980 --> 13:34.220
Uh, no, not really.

13:34.220 --> 13:36.660
So, if someone's hidden it,
it means I'll be able to find it.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.060
Well, theoretically.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.900
I need to speak to Gary Walsh.

13:51.180 --> 13:54.220
Do you have any idea what
they were after?

13:54.220 --> 13:57.820
I found this USB stick hidden in
Burke's room at the base.

13:57.820 --> 13:59.180
Now...

13:59.180 --> 14:00.620
They tried to stop me from leaving,

14:00.620 --> 14:02.780
so I reckon they know
I have something.

14:02.780 --> 14:05.700
Admiral Shaw has requested
a meeting.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.820
Have you had a chance to
look at it yet? I have.

14:07.820 --> 14:10.380
It's videos of Burke, boss.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.220
I mean, he seems to be some
sort of whistle-blower...

14:13.220 --> 14:15.740
 ..but I think that's
just the tip of the iceberg

14:15.740 --> 14:18.660
because all the main folders are
password protected.

14:18.660 --> 14:21.300
I'll get Porter to have a
look at it.

14:21.300 --> 14:24.380
Aha, well done! Hey...

14:24.380 --> 14:26.460
Thanks.

14:27.940 --> 14:29.340
What's her name?

14:29.340 --> 14:31.140
Um, Cat.

14:31.140 --> 14:32.500
It's short for Catherine.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.060
You'll get yourself checked
out before you come in, aye?

14:36.060 --> 14:37.460
I will.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.420
Can you give us five minutes,
please? Sir. How are you, mate?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.980
Bored out of my mind, but she won't
have me moving.

14:49.980 --> 14:53.100
Cox'n, before I forget, will you
check in on Chief Adams for me

14:53.100 --> 14:55.020
later? He doesn't look well.
Yes, ma'am.

14:56.380 --> 14:58.740
Do you mind if I ask you a
few questions?

14:58.740 --> 15:00.460
Well, "I'm a very busy man."

15:01.780 --> 15:05.700
A few days ago, Executive Officer
Prentice put you on charge.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.460
Why was that?

15:07.460 --> 15:08.700
I don't remember.

15:09.780 --> 15:13.060
Do you remember what your movements
were a few hours before
Craig Burke's death?

15:13.060 --> 15:15.660
Well, I was on watch
back aft from seven till one.

15:15.660 --> 15:18.060
I had Adams, Ansell and Khan with me
the whole time.

15:18.060 --> 15:20.460
You didn't leave engineering?
No, I didn't.

15:20.460 --> 15:23.540
At one, I went to my bunk for a kip
and I slept till EO Hadlow woke us.

15:23.540 --> 15:26.220
Yeah, why did Hadlow come to
wake Burke up?

15:26.220 --> 15:29.020
Keep the questions to ones I can do,
eh? I'm no' psychic.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.420
Did you ever argue with Burke?

15:33.420 --> 15:35.340
He was a prick, end of.

15:35.340 --> 15:38.420
You had a fight with him in a pub.
So you know I argued with him.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.860
Don't piss about.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.220
It was a drunk scrap.
Ask me if I killed him.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.380
Did you kill Craig Burke?

15:50.780 --> 15:51.820
No.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.300
Did anyone know you were in the
reactor area when it shut down?

15:58.300 --> 16:00.860
We go and in an' out all the time.
It's not anyone try'na kill me.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.780
OK. I've got everything I need for
now.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.740
I'm going to need you to do
a drugs test.

16:07.420 --> 16:10.700
How's that? I found traces of heroin
in your belongings.

16:14.220 --> 16:17.780
If I've been home before a patrol,
then everything's coated in skag.

16:17.780 --> 16:21.340
My wee brother's a junkie, not me.
Are you happy to do a urine test?

16:21.340 --> 16:23.060
Are you going to hold the cup for
me?

16:23.060 --> 16:24.740
Have you got a container for him?

16:37.060 --> 16:39.980
Enjoy the show. It's all right,
we'll head out.

16:48.460 --> 16:51.500
Don't spring something like that on
one of my patients.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.220
Did you know about this? No, ma'am.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.260
If his alibi holds, we'll know he
can't have met Burke on the missile
deck.

16:56.260 --> 16:58.740
But do we need to go through with
this? Finished.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.500
Here you go! My best stuff.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.420
Oh, clean it up!

17:08.420 --> 17:11.340
Maybe keep her out of my stuff, eh?
Clean that up and do it now.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.660
You need to drink more water.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.180
Negative for opiates. He didn't
bring them on for his own use.

17:56.180 --> 17:58.820
Why would he bring drugs onboard
if he wasn't going to use them?

17:58.820 --> 18:02.900
You know, you're not doing yourself
any favours treating Walsh this way,

18:02.900 --> 18:04.580
especially when his alibi's rock
solid.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.980
There's history of assault.
He brought heroin on board.

18:06.980 --> 18:10.260
Maybe somebody else killed him,
but Walsh was definitely involved.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.740
Well, your 20 minutes are up.
Oh, come on!

18:15.740 --> 18:19.500
I'm here for less than two days.
I need your help. I need a drink.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.700
Do you want one? You look tired.
Maybe, when you've finished this,

18:22.700 --> 18:26.300
you should go and get a shower, get
your head down for a few hours.

18:27.620 --> 18:28.660
Thanks.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.980
I don't know why everyone's so
scared of me finding out the truth.

18:34.980 --> 18:38.100
This boat's two billion
pounds' worth of kit,

18:38.100 --> 18:42.100
but it's run by people who
are making split second decisions

18:42.100 --> 18:44.460
that could kill the whole crew
if they fuck up,

18:44.460 --> 18:46.100
so there has to be trust.

18:46.100 --> 18:49.340
You can't introduce fear
and paranoia into that.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.300
I appreciate that.
Ah, no, you don't.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.740
You've only been here less
than a day.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.780
 Control, I can see
debris on the surface.

18:59.780 --> 19:03.180
Sending co-ordinates for rescue
vessel Victor Two Charlie. Over.

19:11.580 --> 19:14.460
I'm sorry we've not been allowed to
share it with you before now.

19:14.460 --> 19:17.900
If one of my officers reports
a suspected murder,

19:17.900 --> 19:20.980
I don't expect that to be
sat on for 24 hours!

19:20.980 --> 19:23.420
Well, you'll have to take that
up with the MOD.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.260
I don't care what the MOD thinks,

19:25.260 --> 19:27.900
or the Ministry for Agriculture
for that matter.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.500
It's not their remit.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.820
It's above my pay grade
and yours, too, I imagine.

19:32.820 --> 19:38.100
Look, in confidence, we are getting
a boat ready to replace Vigil,

19:38.100 --> 19:39.700
but it takes time.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.220
Perhaps DCI Silva could
remain on board

19:42.220 --> 19:45.900
and continue her investigations
until Vigil returns -

19:45.900 --> 19:47.260
I'd support that.

19:47.260 --> 19:48.780
How long would that be?

19:48.780 --> 19:50.140
Three weeks.

19:50.140 --> 19:53.180
And we'd cooperate, of course.
I know we got off to a bad start,

19:53.180 --> 19:56.060
but perhaps we can all do
a little better.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.380
We'd appreciate being debriefed when
you've been working on this base.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.820
I'll do what I can.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.260
And can we ask you not to call it a
"murder investigation"

20:03.260 --> 20:06.500
when you talk to the
crew's families? Aye, no problem.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.060
Are we done?

20:08.060 --> 20:11.460
Can you tell us what you know about
a trawler sinking off Barra Head?

20:13.180 --> 20:15.740
Certainly. We're assisting the
coastguard.

20:15.740 --> 20:19.140
One of our helicopters has spotted
debris in the water

20:19.140 --> 20:22.180
and we may send in a boat to
scan the seabed.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.500
And the cause?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.900
To be confirmed.
Will you keep us appraised?

20:25.900 --> 20:28.500
Certainly, but I do think that this
one will end up with

20:28.500 --> 20:30.420
Agriculture and Fisheries.

20:30.420 --> 20:33.740
Trawlers do go down from time to
time, I'm afraid.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.340
If Amy thinks it's murder,
I back her.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.100
I think you're right on that.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.940
It's what the girl at the Peace Camp
said.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.460
I mean, I wrote her off, boss,
but she just seemed like the type

20:43.460 --> 20:46.420
who saw conspiracy theories
everywhere, you know?

20:46.420 --> 20:47.900
Well, maybe she's not.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.300
I just need to speak to
Branning again.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.340
Go easy. Hmm.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.660
Lieutenant Commander Branning?

20:55.660 --> 20:57.900
Sorry, there was something I forgot
to ask.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.660
Do you know anything about a fight
that Burke had in a pub?

21:00.660 --> 21:03.180
If you put a request in an email.

21:03.180 --> 21:06.340
This is a murder enquiry now -
we need to work faster than that.

21:06.340 --> 21:09.420
That cuts both ways, doesn't it? If
you're not prepared to debrief us,

21:09.420 --> 21:12.020
we'll do things by the book.
We will try to do...

21:14.980 --> 21:16.900
I'll try to do things better.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.820
Burke and Gary Walsh, they had
a fight in a pub down the road.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.700
I wasn't there, obviously.

21:26.700 --> 21:30.420
And it happened on their own time,
so it was never a formal matter.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.500
I heard Burke went to the
pub to apologise.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.300
For what? Walsh's younger brother
was a trainee here. Douglas?

21:37.300 --> 21:40.540
That's right.
He got involved in some bullying

21:40.540 --> 21:43.060
and Craig Burke gave
evidence against him.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.300
After that, Dougie was discharged.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.100
Did something happen to him?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.260
He killed himself.

21:50.340 --> 21:54.260
I was told Burke showed
up at Dougie's wake at the pub

21:54.260 --> 21:56.140
to apologise to Gary -

21:56.140 --> 21:58.700
that's what started it.
 Shit...

22:00.820 --> 22:03.300
I heard it was two men who
attacked him.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.020
Do you know who the second guy was?

22:30.860 --> 22:32.100
What?

22:34.540 --> 22:38.460
I was just...thinking how weird
it is that you two look so alike.

22:38.460 --> 22:41.580
I know. Everybody says it.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.820
I think it's the eyes.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.220
But she says it, too.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.620
Mind you, I think it's more wishful
thinking on her part.

22:59.020 --> 23:00.820
She asked me to marry you.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.580
What, she...? Yeah.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.860
You were proposed
to by an eight-year-old girl?

23:04.860 --> 23:06.260
Yeah. Yeah.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.500
Listen...

23:16.420 --> 23:17.900
..you know how I feel.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.740
I know.

23:19.740 --> 23:22.580
I think I might be coming

23:19.740 --> 23:22.580
round to it.

23:22.580 --> 23:25.740
So we've ground you down with
our team effort, have we?

23:27.300 --> 23:28.940
Good going, kiddo!

23:42.460 --> 23:43.860
 Attention, all crew.

23:43.860 --> 23:46.780
The submarine has reached
periscope depth. High sea state.

23:46.780 --> 23:49.020
All compartments
maintain stowage for sea.

23:49.020 --> 23:51.860
What's going on?! We're up near the
surface and it's a bit rough.

23:51.860 --> 23:53.300
High sea state...

23:53.300 --> 23:56.060
We've come off batteries
and had to go onto diesels.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.060
Belt up in here, please.

23:58.060 --> 23:59.500
Best stay out the way.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.820
People a lot more experienced
than you are getting hurt.

24:01.820 --> 24:04.380
Oh, you've got post.

24:04.380 --> 24:05.780
A message from the shore.

24:13.700 --> 24:17.140
 Gary Walsh's
brother Dougie was a trainee at
Dunloch.

24:21.940 --> 24:24.220
"Burke reported him for bullying.

24:24.220 --> 24:26.540
"Dougie was dishonourably
discharged,

24:26.540 --> 24:28.340
"later killed himself.

24:28.340 --> 24:31.380
"Second crewman who was close to
Dougie also involved in fight

24:31.380 --> 24:35.380
"at brother's wake -
Engineering Officer Simon Hadlow."

24:41.980 --> 24:43.020
Shit!

24:47.100 --> 24:49.860
Full SOP's on the way, sir. Yep.
Coolant flow,

24:49.860 --> 24:51.980
temperature and pressure were all
within limits,

24:51.980 --> 24:54.660
then suddenly they spiked.
This has never happened before.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.220
We need to figure out what caused
this. Sir. Where's the Cox'n?

24:57.220 --> 24:58.820
I don't know. I'm recording this.

24:58.820 --> 25:01.380
I can't get you a solicitor,
but a judge may determine

25:01.380 --> 25:03.660
that this can be used as evidence
against you in court.

25:03.660 --> 25:05.660
Do you understand?
There's no way I have time.

25:05.660 --> 25:09.540
Lieutenant Hadlow has consistently
tried to avoid my questioning.
Look, I'm needed back.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.780
Just tell me about your relationship
with Craig Burke.

25:11.780 --> 25:15.580
I didn't especially have a problem
with Burke. Never argued with him?

25:15.580 --> 25:17.060
Not so much as a cross word?

25:17.060 --> 25:18.340
No.

25:18.340 --> 25:20.180
But I know you're lying.

25:20.180 --> 25:23.020
You and Gary Walsh beat up
Burke at his brother's wake.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.100
You were close friends with
Gary's brother

25:25.100 --> 25:28.100
and I think you held Burke
responsible for Dougie's suicide,

25:28.100 --> 25:30.980
so let me tell you how a jury is
going to see this.

25:30.980 --> 25:33.420
You and Gary have assaulted
Burke once before

25:33.420 --> 25:36.020
and I can prove that Gary
brought heroin on board.

25:36.020 --> 25:39.700
You were with Burke on the missile
deck where I found his blood and
it was you who found him

25:39.700 --> 25:42.140
allegedly "already dead" in
his bunk, so...

25:43.180 --> 25:45.820
This wasn't me or Walsh,
but I can tell you...

25:47.100 --> 25:48.620
..nobody meant to kill him.

25:48.620 --> 25:49.820
How do you know that?

25:49.820 --> 25:52.660
If it wasn't you, how do you know
what his attacker intended?

25:52.660 --> 25:55.700
I can't talk to you
about this right now. Why not?

25:55.700 --> 25:58.380
It's not up to me.
There's a chain of command.

25:58.380 --> 25:59.660
Oi! What? What does that mean?

25:59.660 --> 26:01.980
Where's Glover? He wasn't available.

26:01.980 --> 26:04.860
Your orders were no talking
without Glover present.

26:04.860 --> 26:08.580
And, Hadlow, just gossiping
during a once-in-a-lifetime crisis

26:08.580 --> 26:11.420
that happened on your watch.
I'm interviewing a suspect.

26:21.060 --> 26:24.140
I don't have anything else to say.
Right, you, follow me.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.700
Sir.

26:45.700 --> 26:46.900
Stay here.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.500
I will send Glover when he's free.
I don't take orders from you.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.340
Do you have any id...?

26:52.580 --> 26:55.940
Do you have any idea how much
trouble this patrol is in?!
You can't have it both ways!

26:55.940 --> 26:58.300
Glover shows up or he doesn't -
either way I have a job to do.

26:58.300 --> 27:01.020
Your job is irrelevant to this
mission. I disagree. Sit down.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.300
Craig Burke would disagree...
Oh, fuck Craig Burke!

27:03.300 --> 27:05.300
Burke was a treacherous little shit

27:05.300 --> 27:07.500
who got exactly what was
coming to him!

27:10.220 --> 27:11.780
He was a drug addict.

27:11.780 --> 27:13.220
He's done enough damage.

27:14.740 --> 27:15.860
No.

27:24.580 --> 27:26.020
Let me out.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.460
Let me out!

27:38.140 --> 27:39.980
Can anyone hear me?!

28:00.060 --> 28:01.580
So, what do you do here?

28:01.580 --> 28:03.500
At the camp? Mm-hm.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.860
From what I can see,
you make a lot of sacrifices.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.300
What keeps you going?

28:08.300 --> 28:11.340
Er, we make a difference.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.940
If we hadn't been observing them,
the Navy would have never

28:13.940 --> 28:16.420
admitted they had reactor
problems in the submarines.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.580
There's a whole lot we've
figured out. Mm-hm.

28:18.580 --> 28:21.740
So, you're kind of like an informal
Health & Safety team?

28:21.740 --> 28:24.620
They want everyone to
think it's safe and it's not.

28:26.980 --> 28:28.860
Is that what Craig Burke thought?

28:43.140 --> 28:47.020
You told me that you thought
that the Navy had killed him.

28:47.020 --> 28:49.540
I didn't say that.
You said something like it.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.380
 Come in.

29:04.860 --> 29:06.740
We think he might have been
murdered.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.220
With it covered up? Maybe.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.540
I found the USB stick
he wanted you to have.

29:18.540 --> 29:21.340
He left you a message as well
as a folder of files.

29:25.980 --> 29:28.100
If it's mine,
you should give it back to me.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.580
What did the message say?

29:32.580 --> 29:34.660
What's the password
for the main folder?

29:37.540 --> 29:40.860
See that? Someone did that to me,
trying to steal it,

29:40.860 --> 29:43.300
and that's with them
knowing that I'm police.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.340
They did a very professional job.

29:45.340 --> 29:47.260
Now, will you look at where you're
living?

29:47.260 --> 29:49.420
You don't even have a lock on
that and, if you did,

29:49.420 --> 29:50.940
one good kick would batter it down.

29:50.940 --> 29:54.100
There's 40 people here who would
help me out. That's not enough,
Jade!

29:54.100 --> 29:56.860
I'm a police officer
and that wasn't enough.

29:56.860 --> 29:59.660
Chances are it was MI5 that did that
to you. Do you know what?

29:59.660 --> 30:02.740
I seriously doubt that. I know for a
fact they watch activist groups.

30:02.740 --> 30:04.980
There's this one guy I've
seen a few times.

30:04.980 --> 30:08.740
He likes wearing this really bad
Glasgow hockey jacket,

30:08.740 --> 30:10.740
trying so hard to fit in.

30:10.740 --> 30:13.300
Another time, when I was coming back
early from a protest

30:13.300 --> 30:14.700
and I saw him at the train station,

30:14.700 --> 30:17.500
he met someone for, like, 30 seconds
and then just walked away.

30:17.500 --> 30:18.860
Tell me that's not dodgy.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.340
If you're worried about that,
you should think about who knew

30:21.340 --> 30:23.380
you and Burke were together.
Hardly anyone knew.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.460
But it was out there.
Not really!

30:25.460 --> 30:28.540
Even if you told one person,
then it is out there.

30:28.540 --> 30:31.340
What was he doing?
Was he helping you?

30:31.340 --> 30:33.780
Was he spying for you?
We were a problem for them,

30:33.780 --> 30:36.220
and now you've gone and made
yourself a problem as well.

30:36.220 --> 30:39.140
Trust me, they won't give a
fuck that you're police.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.260
Jade?

30:41.460 --> 30:44.140
We need to talk about Sunday's
perimeter action. So, can we...?

30:46.340 --> 30:47.420
Is she police?

30:48.580 --> 30:50.820
I'm dealing with it.

30:50.820 --> 30:52.460
Right...

30:52.460 --> 30:54.260
I'm happy to stay.

30:54.260 --> 30:55.620
Nah.

30:55.620 --> 30:56.660
Thanks.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.220
You need to go, now.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.700
I want you to call me

31:10.700 --> 31:13.540
if you see or hear anything at all
that worries you, OK?

31:13.540 --> 31:16.020
Don't look into it. Just call me.

31:19.140 --> 31:21.980
They'll probably tell you
he was a bad guy.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.180
He really wasn't...

31:24.820 --> 31:26.460
..I promise.

31:26.460 --> 31:27.660
 OK.

31:34.180 --> 31:36.980
All right? All right?

32:06.300 --> 32:08.900
Tanker dead ahead! Go deep,
go deep, go deep!

32:08.900 --> 32:10.980
Aye, sir. Dive, dive, dive.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.820
 Drop all masts.
Shut bulkhead doors.

32:14.820 --> 32:16.940
Standby collision.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.540
 Brace, brace, brace!

32:28.860 --> 32:32.060
Full down with the forward planes,
full down with the after planes,
full ahead.

32:32.060 --> 32:35.020
New contact. Tanker.
Marking on sonar.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.740
Zero Three Zero. Zero Three Five.

32:47.180 --> 32:49.020
Zero Four Five.

32:49.020 --> 32:52.500
Now bearing
Zero Eight Five, One Three Five.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.780
We're not deep enough, sir!

33:00.820 --> 33:02.300
Let me out!

33:02.300 --> 33:03.380
Fuck.

33:10.060 --> 33:11.300
One Eight Zero.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.980
One Nine Zero.
Two Zero Five.

33:13.980 --> 33:15.740
Two One Zero.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.300
Contact clear and opening.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.980
We've missed it. How can you not
hear a tanker?! Sorry, sir.

33:30.980 --> 33:33.380
Bow breaker and it was very noisy
with the high sea state...

33:33.380 --> 33:35.780
We nearly bored a hole in
its side! Wake up!

33:37.500 --> 33:38.780
Ship control, report.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.340
Ship control, report.

33:58.420 --> 34:00.420
Two up achieved, sir. Very good.

34:02.100 --> 34:05.820
Prepare to return to periscope
depth. Aye, sir, prepare to return
to periscope depth.

34:05.820 --> 34:08.420
Let's catch a trim. Aye, sir.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.780
There you are!

34:48.780 --> 34:50.140
What's...?

34:52.940 --> 34:54.020
I'm fine.

34:55.100 --> 34:56.340
Fine.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.140
The boat's coming up, you know?

34:59.140 --> 35:01.180
It's... We're going to be all right.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.180
Amy? What's going on?

35:06.180 --> 35:07.380
Prentice locked me in.

35:08.380 --> 35:10.580
He shouldn't have done that.
Oh, I've got you... Shit.

35:10.580 --> 35:12.900
I've got you, I've got you.
It's all right, go on, relax.

35:12.900 --> 35:15.420
Take a deep breath..
Take a deep breath. Here you go.

35:15.420 --> 35:19.100
It's OK, you're out now. You're out
now. It's all right.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.500
It's OK.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.020
Just being in there triggered...

35:27.620 --> 35:30.100
There was an accident...

35:39.180 --> 35:41.300
Iain! Oh, my God.
I need to get you out.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.900
Iain. Mummy, I can't...

35:46.900 --> 35:49.460
It's OK, darling.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.620
Mummy! OK.

35:53.620 --> 35:55.980
All right, sweetheart, it's OK.

35:57.580 --> 35:59.060
We're going to get you out, OK?

35:59.060 --> 36:01.340
OK. All right, we need to take a
deep breath and then,

36:01.340 --> 36:03.220
then we're going to open the door
and swim.

36:03.220 --> 36:05.700
I'm going to come back for
Daddy, OK? Three, two, one...

36:06.700 --> 36:08.220
I had to make a choice.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.140
Swim, baby.

37:08.380 --> 37:12.060
OK, baby, wait here. Mummy!
Please, Mummy!

37:12.060 --> 37:13.860
Wait here. Please! Mummy!

37:22.500 --> 37:23.860
I couldn't get him out.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.900
You know there's a no touching rule.

37:38.060 --> 37:40.740
Sometimes you've got to know
when to break the rules.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.660
Oh, erm...

37:46.660 --> 37:48.820
Briefing in 20 minutes, sir.
Right, thank you.

37:57.820 --> 37:59.420
Right, so...

38:01.940 --> 38:03.660
What next?

38:03.660 --> 38:04.940
I need your help.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.300
Hey, when's dinner?
Oh, shit, sorry.

38:15.300 --> 38:18.020
It's my turn to cook, isn't it?
Tomorrow night? Mm-hm.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.460
I'm going to meet someone.

38:22.460 --> 38:23.740
I've found someone...

38:24.820 --> 38:26.540
..who knows what happened to Craig.

38:28.660 --> 38:31.100
Can I come with you? No.
I'm not going on my own.

38:33.820 --> 38:35.540
They want to help us.

38:35.540 --> 38:37.220
They know everything.

38:44.260 --> 38:46.940
Sir, this is all highly irregular.

38:46.940 --> 38:49.300
I'm concerned about the EPM
giving out again.

38:49.300 --> 38:52.340
We can't run deep without
going to the bottom.

38:52.340 --> 38:55.980
We need to run on diesels
at periscope depth...

38:55.980 --> 38:58.460
..until we know what caused the
scram. No, sorry.

38:59.780 --> 39:03.300
Sitting on the surface to
double-check things is not an option

39:03.300 --> 39:06.620
if we're being trailed by an enemy
submarine. Restart the reactor.

39:06.620 --> 39:09.220
There must be a reason for it
shutting down.

39:09.220 --> 39:11.620
Restarting the reactor without
knowing why

39:11.620 --> 39:14.500
could damage the core and cause a
complete meltdown and sink the boat.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.980
Yes, I understand that.
Get it ready.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.660
Aye, aye, sir. We'll warm it up.

39:20.660 --> 39:23.140
Sir, if I may, I would suggest that
we should...

39:23.140 --> 39:26.700
Mark Prentice, I'm arresting you for
obstructing a police investigation,

39:26.700 --> 39:28.420
holding an officer against her will

39:28.420 --> 39:30.620
and on suspicion of the murder
of Craig Burke.

39:30.620 --> 39:34.740
You're not obliged to say anything,
but anything you do say will be
noted and may be given in evidence.

39:34.740 --> 39:38.220
What in Christ's name are you
talking about? Sir, she clearly
ignored your orders...

39:38.220 --> 39:40.340
I'm not here to debate.
I'm arresting you.

39:40.340 --> 39:43.220
Navigator, you have the submarine.
Roger, sir. I have the submarine.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.700
Have Hadlow inform me when the
reactor's about to go online.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.460
Aye, sir. DCI Silva, XO, with me.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.700
Where were you
an hour before Craig Burke died?

40:23.700 --> 40:25.420
All over the boat, nature of the
job.

40:25.420 --> 40:27.180
And the last time
you saw Burke alive?

40:27.180 --> 40:29.980
I dismissed him from the control
room - plenty of witnesses.

40:29.980 --> 40:32.140
What about Gary Walsh?
What about Gary Walsh?

40:32.140 --> 40:34.620
Why did you leave his charge sheet
without any annotations?

40:34.620 --> 40:37.580
Why were there no repercussions for
Walsh? I've already told you this -

40:37.580 --> 40:40.860
I don't remember.
No, I think you do remember.

40:40.860 --> 40:44.660
I think Gary Walsh came to see you
a few days before Burke died.

40:44.660 --> 40:47.620
I think he told you that he'd found
heroin in Burke's possessions

40:47.620 --> 40:49.740
as an attempt to frame him
to get him kicked out -

40:49.740 --> 40:51.700
revenge for his younger brother.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.900
You saw through that,
but yet there were no annotations

40:54.900 --> 40:56.420
on Walsh's charge sheet,

40:56.420 --> 40:58.260
no repercussions for Walsh,

40:58.260 --> 41:00.860
is that usual for possession of
heroin?

41:00.860 --> 41:03.340
I don't know what you're talking
about.

41:03.340 --> 41:04.620
I've swabbed your cabin.

41:05.780 --> 41:08.700
What will you say when those swabs
come back positive for heroin?

41:08.700 --> 41:10.940
That it was me who picked up
the drugs from Burke's body.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.900
Of course I'm contaminated!
For good...!

41:13.900 --> 41:16.220
With respect, sir, I really think
there's a better...

41:16.220 --> 41:19.180
You called Burke "treacherous" -
it's a very particular word to use.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.300
Why did you call him that?

41:20.300 --> 41:21.620
I didn't call him that.

41:25.060 --> 41:28.380
 "Fuck Craig Burke!
Burke was a treacherous little shit

41:28.380 --> 41:30.620
"who got exactly what was
coming to him!"

41:30.620 --> 41:34.220
You hadn't served with him
on a boat before this patrol.

41:34.220 --> 41:36.620
Why would you call him
"treacherous"?

41:42.300 --> 41:45.340
He'd been sleeping with
a girl at the Dunloch Peace Camp.

41:45.340 --> 41:48.180
How do you know this? With respect,
sir, the Admiralty put me on Vigil

41:48.180 --> 41:50.620
to solve problems and improve
standards.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.620
So you picked on Burke all patrol.

41:52.620 --> 41:55.780
Yes, I disliked him, but I always
played by the rule book.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.940
I picked him
up on his poor standards.

41:57.940 --> 42:00.980
Commander Newsome, could you ask
Hadlow to come and join us?

42:00.980 --> 42:02.260
I believe that he witnessed

42:02.260 --> 42:04.220
the assault on Burke on the missile
deck.

42:04.220 --> 42:07.260
Hadlow's currently overseeing the
reactor - I think you'll agree...

42:07.260 --> 42:09.940
There're plenty who can do that.
It's two minutes of his time.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.260
Officer of the Watch, send
Engineering Officer Hadlow

42:12.260 --> 42:14.620
to the wardroom as soon
as he's ordered the restart.

42:14.620 --> 42:16.420
At least that thing's still working.

42:16.420 --> 42:19.420
Sir, surely Hadlow is
needed back aft? I...

42:19.420 --> 42:22.860
I want to hear it from him. OK,
look, this is what I think happened.

42:22.860 --> 42:27.540
I think you hit Burke, he fell,
he hit his head and there was blood.

42:27.540 --> 42:31.580
You went back later to his cabin to
apologise, or maybe to threaten him,

42:31.580 --> 42:33.380
but instead you find him dead.

42:33.380 --> 42:36.260
You panic - you'd already
confiscated Gary Walsh's heroin

42:36.260 --> 42:38.820
and it was those drugs that you
used to plant on Burke's body -

42:38.820 --> 42:41.180
and I think we're going to be
able to prove that. Right...

42:46.860 --> 42:48.620
Is this really how you operate?

42:48.620 --> 42:51.580
Is tell tall tales and hope
the jury are fucking idiots?

42:51.580 --> 42:53.660
Enter.

42:55.980 --> 42:59.700
Did you see someone hit
Burke on the missile deck?

42:59.700 --> 43:00.940
Uh, I think...

43:00.940 --> 43:02.580
Uh...

43:02.580 --> 43:04.180
M-maybe, sir.

43:04.180 --> 43:05.620
But who?

43:07.940 --> 43:09.300
I didn't see his face, sir.

43:09.300 --> 43:12.100
And you didn't think to report this
to me, after Burke was found dead?

43:12.100 --> 43:14.940
No. No, sir.
I hardly-hardly saw anything.

43:14.940 --> 43:17.660
If you're lying about that, you know
you'll be court-martialled

43:17.660 --> 43:19.420
and the police will prosecute you.

43:21.220 --> 43:22.460
Last chance.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.140
No, I didn't see anything, sir.

43:27.140 --> 43:29.580
Look, when we spoke, you said it
"wasn't up to you".

43:29.580 --> 43:31.300
You said there was a chain of
command.

43:31.300 --> 43:34.540
Were you thinking of any
senior officer in particular?

43:38.100 --> 43:39.540
Was it Prentice you saw?

43:40.980 --> 43:42.420
Couldn't say, sir.

43:44.820 --> 43:48.660
Did Executive Officer Prentice
speak to you?

43:48.660 --> 43:50.900
Did he threaten you or Walsh?

43:50.900 --> 43:53.020
That is a ridiculous slur.

43:57.780 --> 43:59.100
On your way.

44:03.020 --> 44:04.700
What the hell was that about?

44:04.700 --> 44:06.980
Just helping the DCI out,
Mark, as per our orders.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.020
The crew need to know they can be
honest with us.

44:09.020 --> 44:11.820
You just asked a junior officer
if they saw me beat up a rating!

44:11.820 --> 44:15.020
Yes, because I think that is the
question DCI Silva wanted answering.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.940
You were fucked last year,
but they let you hang on -

44:17.940 --> 44:20.260
I was the condition for that.

44:20.260 --> 44:22.660
You are only here because I'm here.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.300
Being married to
an admiral's daughter

44:24.300 --> 44:26.380
doesn't make you
an admiral quite yet

44:26.380 --> 44:28.740
and I do think you have
questions left to answer.

44:28.740 --> 44:30.700
Lock her away
until we can get her off the boat,

44:30.700 --> 44:34.060
or I will write the book
on your many, many failings.

44:34.060 --> 44:37.220
And, yes, maybe I will get my
father-in-law to write the
dedication.

44:37.220 --> 44:39.420
That's very florid, Mark.
That's quite the...

44:39.420 --> 44:42.500
Christ's sake, sir! This is
insanity! Look at our situation!

44:42.500 --> 44:45.420
We have a dead crewman, a reactor
scram and a trawler pulled down

44:45.420 --> 44:48.020
right behind us! Those things
require your fullest...

44:48.020 --> 44:50.380
Enter. ..and immediate...

44:52.860 --> 44:56.100
Is it the reactor? No, sir. They're
still carrying out pre-critical
checks.

44:56.100 --> 44:59.140
It's this. It's Burke's fleece.

44:59.140 --> 45:02.540
We think it was taken from his body
and hidden. Where did you find it?

45:02.540 --> 45:05.780
The DCI asked me to search the
most direct route from Burke's cabin

45:05.780 --> 45:07.740
to Lieutenant Commander Prentice's
cabin.

45:07.740 --> 45:10.700
I found it hidden behind a
ventilation duct on that route.

45:10.700 --> 45:13.100
Thank you. What about Gary Walsh?

45:14.180 --> 45:15.500
Yeah, I spoke to him.

45:17.260 --> 45:19.660
He admits trying to frame Burke
with the drugs

45:19.660 --> 45:22.380
and claims that Prentice took them.

45:22.380 --> 45:23.980
Thank you, Cox'n. Is that all?

45:25.340 --> 45:27.180
 Yes, sir.
As you were.

45:31.820 --> 45:33.820
You hid this because it has your
blood on it.

45:33.820 --> 45:35.980
This isn't something
that you're going to get out of.

45:35.980 --> 45:37.860
Yes, I understand that.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.260
 Sir, engine room's ready
to pull rods.

45:41.340 --> 45:43.020
Very good.

45:43.020 --> 45:45.500
Tell them one minute
and I'll be there. Aye, sir.

45:50.340 --> 45:52.180
You're stood down -

45:52.180 --> 45:53.660
the same will apply to Walsh.

45:53.660 --> 45:55.740
I think it's better that the
crew know the truth.

45:55.740 --> 45:58.700
I'll brief the officers.
You're confined to your cabin.

45:59.900 --> 46:01.660
I don't need to lock you in,
do I, Mark?

46:02.900 --> 46:04.820
When you're done, come and see me.

46:18.460 --> 46:20.220
Ma'am.

46:20.220 --> 46:22.780
Kirsten Longacre.
Can you come and meet me?

46:22.780 --> 46:26.540
I'm freaking out a wee bit.
Can you come? Jade? What's going on?

46:26.540 --> 46:29.660
I want to talk to you.
I think I've messed up.

46:29.660 --> 46:31.780
OK. Where are you?

46:31.780 --> 46:34.260
Um, by the camp. Don't come there.

46:34.260 --> 46:37.300
I'll drop you a pin. Are you far?
Call 999.

46:37.300 --> 46:39.780
It's probably nothing.
No, erm, I was just...

46:39.780 --> 46:43.420
I was meant to meet someone,
but...I want to talk to you first.

46:43.420 --> 46:46.620
OK, well, I'm at Kirkmouth
Police Station. I'm leaving now.

46:46.620 --> 46:50.060
Go somewhere safe, OK? Stay around
people until I can get to you.

47:10.340 --> 47:11.420
Call Porter.

47:15.940 --> 47:17.820
Are you still at work?

47:17.820 --> 47:20.460
Embarrassing you'd assume that,
but, yeah, I am.

47:20.460 --> 47:24.620
Do me a favour - try the word
"Purity" on the USB stick.

47:24.620 --> 47:25.660
Bear with.

47:32.020 --> 47:34.260
We're in.

47:34.260 --> 47:36.620
Oy, there's a tonne of stuff.

47:36.620 --> 47:39.420
Good, great.

47:39.420 --> 47:41.740
Where are you?
I'm heading to Dunloch.

47:41.740 --> 47:43.860
Jade Antoniak called and I think
she's in trouble.

47:43.860 --> 47:46.620
I need you to send backup,
OK? I'll send you a pin now.

47:46.620 --> 47:50.220
On it. Stay in contact,
back up's on its way.

47:54.900 --> 47:56.420
Don't go after Hadlow.

47:57.860 --> 47:59.860
He's just being loyal to his men,

47:59.860 --> 48:02.260
it's...everything we ask them to be.

48:02.260 --> 48:04.740
Tell me about Gary Walsh.

48:04.740 --> 48:06.660
He, er...

48:06.660 --> 48:08.820
He came to see me.

48:08.820 --> 48:11.260
Said he suspected Burke was...

48:11.260 --> 48:14.260
..using drugs. Uh, of course,
I saw that for what it was,

48:14.260 --> 48:16.260
a clumsy attempt to frame Burke,

48:16.260 --> 48:19.380
so I put him on report and
had him bring me the drugs.

48:19.380 --> 48:22.460
And I told him that's not how we do
things. Of course,

48:22.460 --> 48:24.940
I had no intention of holding on
to the drugs, I just, I...

48:26.140 --> 48:27.980
I hadn't got round to disposing of
them.

48:27.980 --> 48:30.100
You didn't think to inform
Captain Newsome?

48:30.100 --> 48:33.820
No. God, no. No, it was a judgment
call. Walsh would've been
court-martialled.

48:33.820 --> 48:36.860
I'd have lost a decent sailor for
the sake of a bad one.

48:37.860 --> 48:40.540
Why was Burke waiting for you on the
missile deck?

48:40.540 --> 48:43.020
He asked me to meet him there.

48:43.020 --> 48:46.300
And you agreed to that?
Yeah, I thought I'd hear him out.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.940
All he wanted to do was
break my nose.

48:52.260 --> 48:53.460
He...

48:54.540 --> 48:55.940
..got a couple of good ones in.

48:57.180 --> 48:59.300
And then I hit him back, and...

49:00.900 --> 49:01.980
..he hit his head.

49:03.940 --> 49:05.140
I went back...

49:06.300 --> 49:08.980
..later, to apologise in his
bunk room.

49:08.980 --> 49:13.060
Did anyone see you? Uh, no.
No. It was before change of watch.

49:13.060 --> 49:15.020
And you found him dead?

49:15.020 --> 49:17.300
He died in front of me. Um...

49:17.300 --> 49:20.140
I mean, I must have
seen his last few seconds.

49:20.140 --> 49:21.340
I did that.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.500
One punch and...

49:28.060 --> 49:29.700
I've worked so bloody hard for this
job.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.060
I know what I did was wrong.

49:32.620 --> 49:34.420
After Burke was dead, what then?

49:34.420 --> 49:37.260
I took the heroin and I tried to
make it look... Well, you know that.

49:37.260 --> 49:39.420
I... You can understand, can't you?

49:39.420 --> 49:42.980
Losing my whole career for the sake
of one punch in self-defence.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.460
You cost me days.

49:45.780 --> 49:47.340
I know.

49:47.340 --> 49:48.660
I know and...

49:50.500 --> 49:52.300
 Oh, Chri...

49:54.060 --> 49:55.100
My...

49:58.380 --> 49:59.740
My wh...

49:59.740 --> 50:02.740
..whole life is the Navy.

50:08.460 --> 50:10.420
You stripped this off him?

50:10.420 --> 50:11.980
Yes.

50:11.980 --> 50:15.140
I knew it would be covered in blood,
so I hid it.

50:22.580 --> 50:25.780
Tell me exactly what he looked like
when you found him.

50:25.780 --> 50:27.140
Exactly.

50:27.140 --> 50:28.300
Uh...

50:28.300 --> 50:30.780
He was comatose, but still...

50:30.780 --> 50:33.100
..twitching. Obviously,
he couldn't breathe.

50:33.100 --> 50:34.580
He was sweating.

50:34.580 --> 50:37.820
His nose was streaming,
buckets of the stuff,

50:37.820 --> 50:40.500
and then he died before I could
even think what to do.

50:42.140 --> 50:45.460
I didn't hit him that hard!
He didn't lose consciousness.

50:45.460 --> 50:47.140
I'm sorry.

50:47.140 --> 50:49.140
There's someone else
I need to speak to.

50:53.140 --> 50:55.740
You know what to do with the stuff
I've put together.

50:55.740 --> 50:59.340
I'm trusting you there
and I do trust you, Jade.

51:01.180 --> 51:02.420
I love you as well.

51:03.940 --> 51:05.340
It's not easy for me to say that.

51:06.660 --> 51:09.260
I should say it to your
face more, I know that.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.500
I have nothing else to say to you,
DCI Silva.

51:27.500 --> 51:30.300
I need to speak to Adams -
it's urgent.

51:30.300 --> 51:31.420
I'll be quick.

51:32.420 --> 51:34.180
You have 30 seconds. Go on.

51:37.060 --> 51:39.460
Are you still feeling unwell?
Yeah, I feel ruined.

51:39.460 --> 51:43.060
What are your symptoms?
Aching, fever.

51:43.060 --> 51:46.900
My eyes keep swimming. Like the flu,
but it never goes anywhere.

51:46.900 --> 51:49.580
You gave Burke mouth-to-mouth? Yeah.

51:49.580 --> 51:52.060
What, have I got a virus off him?
No.

51:52.060 --> 51:54.100
Then what? What's going on with me?

51:54.100 --> 51:56.860
I can't discuss it with you. Can you
see the medic and wait with her?

51:56.860 --> 51:59.140
Officer Adams, I need you here.
Sorry, no chance.

51:59.140 --> 52:02.060
Jesus! He needs to see
the medic as soon as possible.

52:05.700 --> 52:07.180
Captain speaking.

52:07.180 --> 52:08.900
Hear this, all crew.

52:08.900 --> 52:12.060
We are all aware what will happen
if we fail to restart the reactor.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.540
Our entire mission is at stake.

52:14.540 --> 52:17.060
Despite the risks involved,
we have no choice.

52:17.060 --> 52:19.180
Ready to restart the reactor, sir.

52:19.180 --> 52:20.540
Prepare to pull rods.

52:21.580 --> 52:23.380
Did you hear that?

52:23.380 --> 52:26.340
If the reactor scrams again,
note...

52:26.340 --> 52:28.100
..this is a Command call.

52:28.100 --> 52:29.380
On my head.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.300
Go ahead, EO.

52:33.300 --> 52:35.140
Start pulling rods.

52:36.380 --> 52:37.780
Aye, sir.

52:37.780 --> 52:39.860
Pumps are stable.

52:39.860 --> 52:40.900
Pulling rods now.

52:41.980 --> 52:43.700
Pull group one.

52:43.700 --> 52:45.860
Group one...

52:45.860 --> 52:47.180
..50% withdrawn.

52:49.340 --> 52:51.580
Group one, fully withdrawn.

52:51.580 --> 52:54.660
Group one, fully withdrawn, sir.

52:54.660 --> 52:57.820
Group two, 50% withdrawn.

52:59.300 --> 53:01.300
Group two, fully withdrawn.

53:02.620 --> 53:04.780
Group two, fully withdrawn.

53:08.220 --> 53:09.380
Pull group three.

53:10.380 --> 53:12.180
Group three...

53:12.180 --> 53:13.660
..50% withdrawn.

53:19.740 --> 53:21.300
Group three, fully withdrawn.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.380
Group three, fully withdrawn, sir.

53:28.700 --> 53:31.700
Reactor, critical.
Full power is available.

53:31.700 --> 53:33.460
Thank Christ for that.

53:34.540 --> 53:36.740
Reactor level 28% and rising, sir.

53:41.300 --> 53:43.820
Officer of the Watch,
secure from periscope depth.

53:43.820 --> 53:45.700
Return to safe depth.

53:45.700 --> 53:48.620
Roger, sir. Cronin.
Returning to safe depth.

54:07.340 --> 54:09.980
Sir, the recon vessel has located
the wreck of the missing

54:09.980 --> 54:11.700
trawler, the Mhairi Finnea.

54:14.100 --> 54:16.820
Have them dive at first light.
Aye, aye, sir.

54:25.340 --> 54:27.860
I got it wrong about Prentice.
But he's admitted to it.

54:27.860 --> 54:31.340
No. He did what he did because
he thought he'd killed Burke.

54:31.340 --> 54:34.140
I don't think Burke
died of a head injury.

54:34.140 --> 54:35.780
I think he was poisoned.

54:53.140 --> 54:54.980
Jade?!

54:59.100 --> 55:00.580
Jade?!

55:05.060 --> 55:06.180
J...?!

55:07.500 --> 55:10.260
Jade?!

55:36.260 --> 55:37.860
 Jade...

55:39.580 --> 55:42.300
One, two, three, four, five...

55:42.300 --> 55:44.020
C'mon! Jade!

55:46.060 --> 55:49.500
 One, two,
three, four...

55:51.460 --> 55:52.500
J...!

55:55.260 --> 55:56.620
J...!
