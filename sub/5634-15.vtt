WEBVTT

00:12.471 --> 00:15.307
Okay, who'd like to start us off
with show-and-tell?

00:15.390 --> 00:16.600
Stewie?

00:16.683 --> 00:19.645
Yes, today I brought in
my mother's driver's license.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.564
Now, if you look closely,
she's clearly drunk.

00:22.648 --> 00:26.109
You could put a Breathalyzer up
to that photo, and she'd get a DUI.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.278
Ha-ha, Stewie's naked!

00:28.362 --> 00:29.655
What?

00:31.823 --> 00:35.327
Oh, my God! Don't look! Don't look!
Cell phones down! Cell phones down!

00:41.291 --> 00:44.002
-What the deuce?
- Stewie!

00:44.086 --> 00:45.629
Run from the monster.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.881
You might have to drive.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.014
Thank you all so much
for coming this evening

00:56.098 --> 00:58.267
to my very fancy dinner party.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.186
Oh, my God! I'm at Glenn Close's house!

01:01.270 --> 01:03.272
You look very handsome tonight, Stewie.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.232
Well, thank you. And you're the prettiest

01:05.315 --> 01:07.484
of all the women I know
whose name is Glenn.

01:07.568 --> 01:12.114
Everyone, please finish your salads,
because our main course tonight is...

01:12.197 --> 01:14.575
Boiled rabbit.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.078
I-I don't... I don't get that.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.582
It seems weird that I'd have a joke
in my own dream that I don't get.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.333
Oh, thank you so...

01:30.883 --> 01:32.092
Quick, you're almost on!

01:32.176 --> 01:35.012
What? I'm on?
But I don't know any of my lines!

01:41.560 --> 01:48.025
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

01:48.108 --> 01:51.361
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:54.448
- <i>On which we used to rely?</i>

01:54.531 --> 01:57.910
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

01:57.993 --> 02:01.538
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

02:01.622 --> 02:03.832
<i>- All the things that make us</i>

02:03.916 --> 02:05.209
<i>Pumpkin pie!</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:07.127
What the hell? Put him on the bench.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.254
Wait, please, no! I just wasn't ready!

02:10.422 --> 02:12.174
Don't worry. We'll put you in soon.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.550
Ho-ho-ho!

02:13.634 --> 02:16.303
Is funny because you won't be back!

02:17.054 --> 02:22.184
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

02:24.436 --> 02:26.980
Wait, how did Joe
get halfway up those stairs?

02:27.064 --> 02:29.816
Lois, get in here!
It's dark and I'm frightened!

02:33.028 --> 02:35.113
I think they've got this thing backwards.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.411
Hey, wake up! I had a bad dream,
so now your night has to be terrible.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.915
Peter, Stewie's upset.
Scooch over so he can sleep with us.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.710
Oh, come on. Are you serious?
Last time, he kicked me all night.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.171
And I got a big day tomorrow.
I got two shows.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.549
All right, folks, big treat for you today.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.967
He's a little shy.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.719
Put your hands together for Sham-Peter!

02:57.803 --> 03:00.764
I'm not shy! I'm angry!

03:00.848 --> 03:02.516
I'm in constant pain!

03:03.642 --> 03:06.687
This act has been condemned
by over 30 nations!

03:06.770 --> 03:08.355
I'm gonna kill you all!

03:13.026 --> 03:14.945
<i>Ah, crap. I can't sleep like this.</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:16.738
<i>And now my mind is racin'.</i>

03:16.822 --> 03:19.992
<i>Like, how does that candle</i>
<i>in</i> Beauty and the Beast <i>sing so good?</i>

03:20.075 --> 03:22.369
<i>I mean, the teapot I get,</i>
<i>'cause she's a girl.</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:25.539
<i>But</i><i>the candle, I don't under...</i>
<i>Oh, he's French. That's why.</i>

03:30.502 --> 03:32.045
Couch it is, I guess.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.881
Oh, my God. The couch is gone.

03:33.964 --> 03:37.259
Where the hell is... Oh, that's right.
Couchella is this weekend.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.305
Hey, man, where you been?

03:41.388 --> 03:44.308
I just had sex with a girl on her period!

03:44.391 --> 03:46.185
Dude, that's not a brag!

03:51.857 --> 03:53.525
So, how fat are you?

03:53.609 --> 03:55.611
Two-forty? Nice.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.572
- Oh, Peter! What are you doing down here?
- Oh, hey, Brian.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.617
Stewie kind of took over our bed,
so I'm looking for a place to sleep.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.828
Well, why don't you go up to the attic?
I think there's even a futon up there.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.538
Huh. That's a great idea.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.248
Geez, I'm glad you came along.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.876
I'm gonna sleep better
than a cartoon sheriff.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.805
I was in jail
'cause I killed a bunch of old ladies.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.225
And now that I'm out,
I'm gonna do it again.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.235
Wow, Stewie, you look exhausted.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.404
Yeah, 'cause I was up super late
last night, beefing your mom.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.074
- My mom's dead.
- Yeah, 'cause I beefed her to death.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.451
Whoa, what's your problem?
Why are you being such a jerk?

04:44.535 --> 04:46.954
I'm sorry, Brian.
I had the absolute worst night.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.165
I had a weird dream. A frightening dream.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.792
Yeah, Stewie, that's called a nightmare.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.627
Sounds like you must've had
your first one.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.087
That's what a nightmare is?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.548
I thought "nightmare" meant,
like, being invited

04:57.631 --> 04:58.757
to an apartment party.

04:58.841 --> 05:02.678
Get a house if you want to have a party.
I'm not going to a party in an apartment.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.097
Relax, it's no big deal.
People have nightmares all the time.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.016
Oh, no, Brian. I am not living
through that horror again.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.644
In fact, I've decided
that from this day forward,

05:10.727 --> 05:13.188
I shall never allow myself
to fall asleep again.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.524
Come on, that's ridiculous.
How do you think you're gonna do that?

05:15.607 --> 05:19.361
I don't know. Maybe I'll get a job
working the night shift at a supermarket.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.113
Hey, where's the vegetable aisle?

05:21.196 --> 05:24.324
Yeah, right, it's 2:00 a.m.
You're not here for vegetables.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.327
Well, I got the 12 cucumbers.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.371
- What's wrong?
- Just this guy at the...

05:29.454 --> 05:30.998
Never mind.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.753
Peter, we have a hamper.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.548
Stop throwing your dirty clothes
in the toilet.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.632
Peter?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.551
Peter, where are you?

05:46.138 --> 05:47.598
What's all this?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.225
Oh, hey, Lois. Welcome to the Pete Pad,

05:50.309 --> 05:52.978
where the dancing's hot,
the drinks are hot...

05:53.061 --> 05:54.646
Everything's just freakin' hot.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.398
What have you done to the attic?

05:56.481 --> 05:57.900
Well, when I slept up here
the other night,

05:57.983 --> 05:59.610
I realized what a great space it is.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.446
So I dragged up some stuff
and turned it into a sweet hangout.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.699
Even made it extra awesome
by stealing a real street sign.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.580
I don't understand.
What are you gonna do up here?

06:11.663 --> 06:15.626
Eh, mostly just burn the roof of my mouth
on unevenly-heated microwave burritos.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.378
Now I'm busy,
so close the floor and get out of here.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.844
All right, all right, come on, Stewie.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.222
You've got to stay awake.
I know what'll help.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.350
I'll watch that preview channel
that always has inconsistent volumes.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.561
<i>They're mother and daughter</i>
<i>but also best friends.</i>

06:34.645 --> 06:37.189
<i>Catch</i> Gilmore Girls <i>on Channel 367.</i>

06:37.272 --> 06:40.150
<i>You can</i>
<i>name your own price</i><i>for hotel rooms!</i>

06:54.498 --> 06:56.333
Help! Please!

06:57.626 --> 07:00.671
Damn it! Why can't I move?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.052
Aah!

07:07.135 --> 07:08.804
Stewie, you okay? What happened?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.430
I was just sitting here on the couch

07:10.514 --> 07:12.724
and I had another nightmare
about that horrible monster.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.811
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna help you
get these nightmares under control.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.646
Really? Oh, thank you, Brian.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.315
And maybe I can help you
control your strange obsession

07:20.399 --> 07:21.984
with eating pencil erasers.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.069
It's not an obsession.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.487
Mmm, mmm, oh, yeah.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.489
Oh, so rubbery. Mmm.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.366
It's like a little steak. Mmm, mmm.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.826
Brian, you really should...

07:30.909 --> 07:33.453
The world is small and safe
when I do this!

07:40.043 --> 07:42.921
Okay, Stewie, I read the review
of a dream book on Amazon,

07:43.005 --> 07:44.339
so I think I can help you.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.467
Literally every other tab
is open to Lusty Matures.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.219
Yup, that's what it takes now.

07:49.303 --> 07:53.056
Anyway, it says here that most nightmares
are born of subconscious fears.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.018
So maybe if we make a list of the things
you're most afraid of,

07:56.101 --> 07:58.020
we can face and conquer
these fears together,

07:58.103 --> 07:59.730
and then your nightmares'll end.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.150
Huh, that's actually a good idea.
Like the U.S. Army Reserves.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.696
We're completely surrounded.
We need reinforcements.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.698
You know who could really bail us out?

08:09.781 --> 08:13.410
Somebody who works five days a week
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.958
These new digs of yours
are pretty great, Peter.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.294
Hey, I brought
construction paper and markers

08:22.377 --> 08:24.463
in case you guys want to draw breasts.

08:24.546 --> 08:28.008
Cool. But before that,
who's up for another insulation fight?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.760
- I'm in.
- Heck yeah.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.847
- Ha!

08:33.931 --> 08:35.057
Gotcha!

08:38.227 --> 08:39.394
Missed me.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.271
Sneak attack!

08:47.653 --> 08:49.363
What are you doing up here?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.281
I need you to take the trash out.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.658
You know what? I'm gonna use this

08:52.741 --> 08:54.868
Peter Doesn't Have to Take Out
the Trash coupon

08:54.952 --> 08:56.453
that I got for my anniversary.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.913
You gave that to yourself.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.915
I don't know, it says "official."

08:59.998 --> 09:04.586
Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself.
This whole attic business is ridiculous.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.839
Hey, guys, check it out.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.382
I'm a lady.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.800
Joe...

09:09.883 --> 09:12.427
You hit a home run with that,
I want to try it.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.725
All right, Stewie,
time to tackle your fears.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.061
Now, it sounds like
you're scared of monsters.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.605
So to help you get over it,
here's Frankenstein.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.525
I'm Frankenstein.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.360
I'm actually really nice.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.738
There's no need
to be scared of me.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.575
Seriously? This is obviously Chris
in a costume.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.410
Huh. Well, that can't be possible.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.204
Because here comes Chris
walking in the door right now.

09:39.288 --> 09:43.041
Hey, hey, hey. Here comes Chris Griffin,
a-roodly-toot-toot.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.459
Yeah, okay, whatever, Meg.

09:44.543 --> 09:49.047
Meg? You must be talking about me,
a-roodly-toot-toot.

09:57.014 --> 10:00.225
- Do they all say "a-roodly-toot-toot"?
- A lot of them, yeah.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.398
Chris, I'm putting
together a load of laundry.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.482
You got anything?

10:10.652 --> 10:14.031
Damn it, Peter. Are you guys
playing lawn darts in the attic again?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.199
No.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.575
Yay, lawn darts!

10:16.658 --> 10:17.784
Peter wins lawn darts.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.912
She's dumb. She got no idea.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.542
All right, Peter, that's enough.
It is time to get out of...

10:25.626 --> 10:26.627
What the hell?

10:26.710 --> 10:30.047
Oh, yeah, we put Joe
in Stewie's old Jolly Jumper.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.382
You told me this was
a paratrooper's harness.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.800
Shut up, baby man.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.385
That's it. This is our home,

10:35.469 --> 10:37.679
not some frat house
for you and your friends.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.681
Now, I want you out of this attic now.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.726
No way, we ain't leaving.
We're having too much fun up here.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.062
Quagmire just showed us
his Eric McCormack impression.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.605
There could be no such thing.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.190
Well, that's what I said,
but then he did it,

10:48.273 --> 10:50.901
and I was like,
"Oh, all right, okay, yeah, kind of."

10:50.984 --> 10:54.404
Fine. You like the damn attic so much?
Then enjoy the attic!

10:59.576 --> 11:01.620
Did... Did she just lock us in here?

11:01.703 --> 11:02.996
It looks like it.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.166
Guys, spin me back.
I didn't see what happened.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.881
So, how'd it go last night?
Did we cure your nightmares?

11:12.965 --> 11:14.842
No, not at all. They were worse than ever.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.718
Which is why I built this.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.728
What the hell is that?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.605
It's a Digital Dream Interface.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.649
You see, once connected to this device,

11:30.732 --> 11:33.026
you will be able to enter
my sleeping mind,

11:33.110 --> 11:35.737
where you will end these horrible dreams
once and for all.

11:35.821 --> 11:36.947
I'm gonna do what?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.659
What... What-what does he want?
What is he saying?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.828
I think he's saying "a-roodly-toot-toot."

11:42.911 --> 11:44.997
We just can't understand him
because of the way he talks.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.750
Oh, no, no,
I think he just needs a ride home.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.632
Stewie, you can't be serious.

11:55.716 --> 11:56.967
Oh, I'm very serious.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.220
You and I will place these cranial
impulse receptor caps on our heads,

12:00.304 --> 12:01.930
I shall begin my slumber, and...

12:02.014 --> 12:04.474
And then this thing will actually allow me
to enter your dream?

12:04.558 --> 12:07.394
That's right, Brian. I want you
to come inside me while I'm asleep.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.937
Do-Don't... Don't say it like that.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.898
And once you're in my dream,
your job is to stop

12:10.981 --> 12:13.817
these nightmares by finding
that monster and killing him.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.777
This isn't a job for the meek, Brian.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.071
When you get in there,
you've got to be hard.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.324
- Okay, but that felt intentional.
- All right, let's get to it.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.411
This is your receptor cap.
Over here is your REM monitor.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.662
What's this thing do?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.789
Oh, that's just a little
bike bell for fun.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.376
I found it at the crosswalk where
those kids got creamed the other day.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.461
Anyway, let's get started.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.076
Hello? Stewie?

13:14.419 --> 13:17.089
Ah, you must be Brian. I'm Glenn.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.425
Yes, I know.
You were very mean in <i>101 Dalmatians.</i>

13:20.509 --> 13:23.720
Thank you. Would you like
to do the Bristol Stomp?

13:23.804 --> 13:26.306
<i>The kids in Bristol</i>
<i>Are sharp as a pistol</i>

13:26.390 --> 13:28.225
<i>When they do the Bristol Stomp</i>

13:28.308 --> 13:29.726
How does he even know this?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.979
He heard it once in the car.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.984
Geez, Lois is really serious.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.319
I can't believe
she left us up here all night.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.029
Damn it, we got to do something.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.699
Maybe if we just scream for help
someone'll hear us.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.325
Help! Help!

13:45.409 --> 13:46.410
Help!

13:46.493 --> 13:49.997
<i>In case</i>
<i>of a bear attack, you should A, lie down,</i>

13:50.080 --> 13:53.709
<i>B, run downhill,</i><i>or C, stand your ground?</i>

14:02.050 --> 14:04.094
...and just because of the roles I play,

14:04.178 --> 14:07.472
people always assume
I'm very serious in real life.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.474
- Yeah, I could see that.
- But I'm not.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.810
I'm very capable of being silly, too.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.645
See, watch, I'll show you.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.231
Fart.

14:16.315 --> 14:19.610
I, uh... Did-did...
Did you just say "fart"?

14:19.693 --> 14:22.654
Yes, that's me being rather silly.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.240
Well, hello, Brian.
I say, what brings you here?

14:25.324 --> 14:26.325
Stewie, hey!

14:26.408 --> 14:29.411
I'm here to find and kill the monster
that's been causing all your nightmares.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.455
Oh, that sounds wonderful! Let's do it!

14:31.538 --> 14:34.666
Oh, but real quick, I'm just gonna
turn into Elmo for a second.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.834
Hi, Brian!

14:35.918 --> 14:38.921
Elmo speak bad English
on educational show!

14:39.004 --> 14:40.506
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

14:41.006 --> 14:42.591
Okay, I'm back. Let's go.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.886
This way to the subconscious.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.812
- Oh, this seems rather pleasant.
- Yeah.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.774
Hey, you know, that Glenn Close
salad actually wasn't bad.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.651
Yeah, a lot of my dreams
have pretty good salad.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.280
- Oh, no.
- What? Where are we?

15:05.364 --> 15:06.782
We're at the doctor!

15:06.865 --> 15:09.493
Time for a baby shot in your fanny!

15:32.474 --> 15:35.769
Come give Grandpa
a sloppy, old-man, coffee kiss!

15:55.080 --> 15:57.749
Would you like some candy?

15:57.833 --> 16:00.627
Help me find my lost puppy?

16:00.711 --> 16:03.422
I like your mouth and butt.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.633
What the hell was that?

16:06.717 --> 16:09.178
Lois has painted
a very dark picture of abduction.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.307
Adult stuff, adult stuff, adult stuff.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.310
The world is scary,
adult stuff, adult stuff.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.938
Scary people yelling in another
part of the world, adult stuff.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.650
I wish Mom wouldn't watch the news
in front of me!

16:23.734 --> 16:25.777
Coming up, a map with a hurricane on it.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.822
And you don't know your states yet!

16:36.205 --> 16:39.249
Aah! That one trip
to the petting zoo really messed me up!

16:39.333 --> 16:40.792
I saw too much!

16:56.934 --> 16:58.268
Stewie, look!

16:59.561 --> 17:01.480
It's the monster!

17:01.563 --> 17:03.106
Quick, Brian! Kill it!

17:03.190 --> 17:04.358
Oh, there you guys are.

17:04.441 --> 17:05.859
I would've been here sooner,

17:05.943 --> 17:08.904
but one of my legs is a snake
that's very hungry for mice.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.852
Nice shot. Get it? Shot?

17:39.935 --> 17:41.228
All right, bye!

17:45.107 --> 17:48.026
You did it, Brian! You killed the monster!

17:51.655 --> 17:54.533
What the hell? It's me!

17:54.616 --> 17:56.285
Oh, my God, you're right!

17:56.368 --> 17:58.120
But I... I don't understand.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.289
Why am I the source of your fears?

18:00.372 --> 18:02.040
Huh. I'm not sure.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.668
Maybe this means that deep down,

18:04.751 --> 18:08.213
the thing I'm most afraid of
is disappointing you.

18:08.297 --> 18:11.300
Me? Wh-Why do you care so much
about what I think?

18:11.383 --> 18:12.467
Well, think about it.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.386
You've been more of a father figure to me

18:14.469 --> 18:16.263
than the fat man ever
has been or ever will be.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.515
Look, I know
I'm always busting your balls,

18:18.599 --> 18:21.059
but it's just because
you're the only person in this house

18:21.143 --> 18:23.061
whose judgment actually matters to me.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.522
Wow. Thanks, Stewie.

18:25.606 --> 18:28.692
But listen, you-you never have
to worry about letting me down.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.235
I'll always be proud of you.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.362
In fact, I already am.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.031
- You are?
-'Course I am.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.991
I mean, you're only a baby, and yet,

18:36.074 --> 18:38.285
you're one of the most
amazing people I know.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.953
Well, thank you, Brian.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.958
Well, Stewie,
seems like my work here is done.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.668
What's the best way out of here?

18:46.752 --> 18:49.922
Oh, yeah, no, that one stays locked
until the overnight to Vegas

18:50.005 --> 18:51.673
with my college a cappella group.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.389
Peter, I'm going crazy up here.

18:59.473 --> 19:00.807
We all are!

19:00.891 --> 19:02.434
You got to talk to Lois!

19:02.518 --> 19:03.644
Damn it, you're right.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.979
Lois, let us out of here!

19:06.063 --> 19:07.856
No way! You like it so much?

19:07.940 --> 19:10.192
Then you can rot up there
with your buddies!

19:10.275 --> 19:13.278
Lois, so help me God,
if you don't let us out right this second,

19:13.362 --> 19:15.155
I'm gonna take a dump
on your wedding dress!

19:15.239 --> 19:16.573
You wouldn't dare!

19:16.657 --> 19:19.159
Don't test me. I'll do it!
We'll all do it!

19:19.243 --> 19:20.827
Quagmire, pull down your pants!

19:20.911 --> 19:24.039
- What? I'm not doing that!
- You leave my dress alone, Peter!

19:24.122 --> 19:26.625
If it'll get us out of here,
I'll make a doodie on it.

19:26.708 --> 19:27.960
What, are you nuts?

19:28.043 --> 19:29.503
I've been crowning
for six hours!

19:29.586 --> 19:32.756
Cleveland's pants are off, Lois!
Here come mine! This is happening!

19:32.840 --> 19:34.591
Lois, they're not bluffing!
Open the door!

19:34.675 --> 19:36.009
I miss Bonnie!

19:36.093 --> 19:38.804
Damn it, Peter, you hold that in!
I know you can!

19:38.887 --> 19:40.722
You did it on the ferry to Block Island!

19:40.806 --> 19:42.140
Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke!

19:42.224 --> 19:44.184
That's good!
Puke on the dress! Puke on the dress!

19:44.268 --> 19:45.602
Aah, damn it!

19:47.813 --> 19:50.274
<i>Not all snake bites are lethal.</i>

19:54.069 --> 19:55.445
There! You happy?

19:55.529 --> 19:57.990
You were too late. We pooed on the gown.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.033
Ripped a big hole in your ceiling, too.

20:00.117 --> 20:01.326
I barfed on Peter's ass.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.495
I-I don't know if it got
on the dress or not, Lois,

20:03.579 --> 20:05.038
but I-I am... I am so sorry.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.624
Yeah, this was all a huge disaster.

20:07.708 --> 20:12.087
Let's just agree
that we both went a bit too far, hmm?

20:12.171 --> 20:14.173
I, uh... I might...

20:14.256 --> 20:16.758
I might need two weeks off
from this friendship.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.729
Stewie, you awake?
Did you have any nightmares?

20:28.812 --> 20:29.813
I don't think so.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.773
Did you get rid of the monster?

20:31.857 --> 20:34.318
Sure did. Turned out
that monster was nothing more

20:34.401 --> 20:37.863
than a manifestation of your subconscious
desire not to disappoint me.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.990
Apparently, I'm like
a father figure to you.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.243
Okay. Wow. Somebody's got a big head.

20:43.327 --> 20:46.830
Stewie, I want you to know...
I'm very proud of you.

20:46.914 --> 20:50.250
All right, that's... That's awkward.
How-how am I supposed to respond to that?

20:50.334 --> 20:52.669
- You are a good person.
- Stop complimenting me.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.214
"Oh, I sure hope the dog
approves of who I am."

20:55.297 --> 20:56.798
I'm out of here, weirdo.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.553
There's a wedding dress out here
covered in .
