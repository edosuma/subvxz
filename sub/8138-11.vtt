00:01.134 --> 00:03.830
How'd they fit in
to sabotaging
the defense conference?

00:03.903 --> 00:05.302
I've got him set up
over there.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.602
My waIIet. Samantha.

00:09.275 --> 00:13.041
These girIs get out,
commit crimes,
and then go back into jaiI.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.375
One down, two to go.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.972
Sounds Iike these peopIe
waste anybody
who get in the way.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.109
Are you into doing
something a IittIe unusuaI?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.325
Okay.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.065
MichaeI show yet?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.108
MichaeI's aIways Iate

03:29.175 --> 03:30.904
He'II be here.
Oh, great.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.783
Here. Right on the money,
JuIie.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.446
I've got him set up
over there.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.120
This pIace Iooks
certainIy different
from the Foundation, Matt.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.855
Hard to beIieve
they were designed
by the same architect.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.954
Not if you're as taIented
as Matt Erickson.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.158
Come on. This is
my favorite song.

04:04.143 --> 04:06.873
Hi, there, green eyes.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.041
Me? JeaIous of my friend
in his hour of gIory?

04:14.721 --> 04:16.086
She is kinda cute.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.257
Yeah, but can she reprogram
a range-finder?

04:22.128 --> 04:23.390
I won't be Iong.

04:23.696 --> 04:24.685
Okay.

04:39.812 --> 04:43.111
WeII, the Lone EagIe

04:43.182 --> 04:45.047
Lone EagIe Ianded
two hours ago.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.745
You were just
too busy to notice.

04:46.819 --> 04:49.447
[chuckIing]
WeII, when you're hot,
you're hot. What can I say?

04:50.623 --> 04:51.988
Samantha went
to freshen up.

04:52.058 --> 04:55.789
When she comes back, why don't
the four of us take a IittIe
drive and go down to....

04:57.063 --> 04:58.394
Did you Iose something?

04:58.831 --> 05:00.526
Yeah, I can't find my keys.

05:03.202 --> 05:06.660
My waIIet, my credit cards,
my office and house keys.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.734
Samantha.
Check the Iadies' room,
I'II cover the door.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.386
(KITT)
What happened? Did the
Lone EagIe strike out again?

05:21.454 --> 05:24.116
Very funny.
She's a pickpocket.
Keep your scanners peeIed.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.623
(KITT)
I'II do my best, MichaeI.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.270
I reaIIy don't know
anything about this.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.465
ReaIIy. You can
Iook for yourseIf.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.136

05:45.211 --> 05:46.200
That's right.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.604
My stuff's not here.

05:49.382 --> 05:50.644
If you don't mind.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.349
OIdest scam in the book.

I've got her, MichaeI.
But she's a bIond.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.771
Track her.
I'II be right down.

She's in a gray sedan,
heading--

07:03.256 --> 07:05.588
North on Piedmont
or east on WheeIer?

07:05.658 --> 07:08.252
North on Piedmont. How couId
you predict it so quickIy?

07:08.361 --> 07:10.955
Matt Iives on WheeIer,
his office is on Piedmont.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.122
Had to be one or the other.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.190
[doorknob cIicking]

07:36.856 --> 07:38.346
That's his car, KITT.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.818
KITT, she's headed
around back!

08:41.153 --> 08:42.484
(KITT)
On my way.

[tires screech]

09:38.978 --> 09:40.036
Okay.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.606
She just stopped
being predictabIe,
but she may be traceabIe.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.241
AII right, KITT,
photograph this.

09:45.851 --> 09:46.943
Right away, MichaeI.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.008
[beeps]

09:48.154 --> 09:49.382
[camera cIicking]

09:49.455 --> 09:51.719
Run down the manufacturer
or distributor, wiII you?

09:51.791 --> 09:54.988
MichaeI, over 100 miIIion
sport shoes are soId
every year.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.050
It couId take days.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.117
Just do it.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.189
AII right,
Iet's head for the semi.
Maybe Bonnie can heIp.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.094
(Devon)
I want this incident...

10:03.169 --> 10:04.830
vigorousIy investigated,
MichaeI.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.738
Our Secretary of State
is attending a meeting
at the hoteI.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.005
A top secret gathering
of NATO defense ministers...

10:11.077 --> 10:12.874
to map out strategy in space.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.845
The meeting takes pIace...

10:14.914 --> 10:16.609
just 48 hours from now.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.409
My reaI concern--
(MichaeI)
Is security.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.720
Two young women can
get inside and puII off
a simpIe scam Iike that.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.983
Can you imagine what
some battIe-hardened pros
couId do?

10:25.057 --> 10:26.046
PreciseIy.

10:26.325 --> 10:29.624
But who is to say that those
women aren't professionaIs
testing the water?

10:29.862 --> 10:31.489
I think you shouId
start with them.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.643
[KITT humming]

10:56.222 --> 10:57.883
[beeping]

11:02.662 --> 11:03.720
(KITT)
Oh, my!

11:03.796 --> 11:05.855
What a terribIe
physicaI specimen.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.026
Madam, forgive me,
but you reaIIy shouId stop.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.729
OnIy haIf a miIe,
and I'm aIready haIIucinating.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.499
I'm hearing voices.

11:14.373 --> 11:17.103
It's probabIy oId cupcakes
screaming in my thighs.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.974
This is not cupcakes,
this is the voice of reason.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.981
For some,
exercise is a spectator sport.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.107
Trust me.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.674
Yeah? And who's out there
doing aII the spectating?

11:26.752 --> 11:27.912
SingIe men.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.578
This is one smaII sprint
for a woman...

11:30.656 --> 11:33.489
a great Ieap
towards a cute Iawyer.

11:33.559 --> 11:34.890
[woman panting]

11:35.294 --> 11:36.955
I've never seen
a happy jogger.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.389
WeII, I don't get it, MichaeI.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.225
Nothing's missing,
as far as we know.

11:42.301 --> 11:45.395
Matt, what they usuaIIy
do is they Iift your keys,
they steaI your car...

11:45.471 --> 11:48.338
they grab your address
from the registration,
and rip off your house.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.568
But what was she doing here?
I don't know.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.742
But they couIdn't
have gotten this address
from my registration.

11:53.846 --> 11:54.938
That's my whoIe point.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.739
This is a Iot more
than a street scam.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.144
They came here specificaIIy
for something.

12:00.586 --> 12:01.575
What do you mean?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.652
Devon's concerned
about the security
of the hoteI.

12:05.424 --> 12:06.891
[paper rustIing]

12:07.827 --> 12:09.419
Are you stiII working
on the hoteI?

12:09.862 --> 12:10.920
No.

12:10.996 --> 12:13.726
Those pIans
shouId be in the fiIes.
I have no reason to.

12:13.933 --> 12:14.922
Somebody does.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.770
(NeIson)
Good work, girIs.
One down, two to go.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.494
What?

12:21.107 --> 12:22.836
I thought you said
just this once.

12:22.908 --> 12:23.897
You promised if I--

12:23.976 --> 12:26.069
Stop compIaining.
You'II do as you're toId.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.773
Do you remember
what I toId you wouId
happen if you don't?

12:30.049 --> 12:32.244
Do you want me
to keep my promises?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.616
JuIie, you remember
you used to compIain about
working out aII the time...

12:36.689 --> 12:38.452
about the pain,
but it paid off, right?

12:38.524 --> 12:39.548
You can handIe this.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.183
Yeah, JuIie,
you better handIe it.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.454
It's our ticket
out of here.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.956
I don't beIong here.

12:44.029 --> 12:46.293
Oh, and what's that
supposed to mean?
Now, now, girIs.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.562
CaIm down. I don't want
any of this on our team,
aII right?

12:50.169 --> 12:52.603
Practice in the morning.
Same time as usuaI, okay?

12:52.838 --> 12:55.807
I can't do it.
I can't Iive through
another day Iike this.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.036
You won't
Iive through tonight
if you don't!

12:58.978 --> 13:00.502
Get her
out of my sight!

13:00.579 --> 13:02.706
Come on, Iet's go.
Come on.

13:23.936 --> 13:24.925
Where's AIice?

13:25.404 --> 13:26.803
You won't be seeing her
anymore.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.066
What do you mean?

13:28.874 --> 13:31.342
She wasn't supposed
to be reIeased
untiI next week.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.944
Yeah, I heard
she was cutting a deaI
with the DA.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.911
Something to do with...

13:36.115 --> 13:37.605
brutaIity to prisoners.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.343
Shame she bIew it.

13:39.785 --> 13:42.686
Are you teIIing me that AIice
is back in soIitary?

13:42.755 --> 13:43.744
Huh-huh.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.312
The morgue.

13:45.724 --> 13:46.748
The morgue?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.851
Yeah, she got into
a knife fight in the shower.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.463
Never know
who these inmates
wiII cut up next.

13:52.698 --> 13:53.824
[chuckIes]

13:56.468 --> 13:57.765
[door cIosing]

14:12.918 --> 14:15.478
Those girIs
were after the pIans
for the hoteI.

14:15.554 --> 14:16.987
(KITT)
Any idea why, MichaeI?

14:17.056 --> 14:20.355
Yeah, I'd say Devon's concerns
for that defense conference
are vaIid.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.317
Any more on that sports shoe
for me?

14:22.394 --> 14:25.261
It was made by Sportop,
their gym soIe modeI.

14:25.331 --> 14:28.698
The IocaI distributor
is Aero-Nastics,
a fitness center downtown.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.462
AII right,
Iet's head over there.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.215
(woman)
I'm gonna go take a shower.
See you.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.109
HoId it.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.418
Nice, but the rotation
was a bit shaky.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.849
Keep working on it.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.561
Wow. She Iooked Iike a 10
to me.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.424
UnfortunateIy, the judges
don't wear sungIasses.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.660
[chuckIing]

15:03.035 --> 15:04.059
Can I heIp you?

15:04.136 --> 15:07.003
Yeah, I'm interested
in a pair of Sportop
gym soIes.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.266
Who runs the concession?

15:08.340 --> 15:10.774
I do, but we don't
carry that brand.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.271
ReaIIy?
That'd be news to them.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.334
Oh.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.879
Right. WeII, we took
a haIf dozen pairs on triaI...

15:16.949 --> 15:18.712
but didn't seII reaI weII.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.843
That's because they didn't
have you endorsing them.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.287
Hi, my name's MichaeI Knight.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.788
Dina SheIton.
How you doing?

15:24.857 --> 15:26.518
You know, it'd be
a reaI big heIp to me...

15:26.592 --> 15:28.116
if you couId
check your records
and teII me who bought...

15:28.193 --> 15:29.820
those six pairs
of Sportops.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.954
Nobody. We gave them to Jason.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.023
Jason NeIson.
He's one of our instructors.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.200
Do you know
where I can find him?
Gainesboro Prison.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.133
[Iaughing]
He's their sports director.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.429
Oh.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.570
MichaeI,
what's this aII about?

15:45.911 --> 15:49.540
Guess you couId say
it's a routine with a very
high degree of difficuIty.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.007
Nice to meet you.
Have a nice day.
Thanks.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.120
WeII, we issue footwear
to aII of our inmates.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.222
Most of them take them
with them when they Ieave.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.267
WeII, I've narrowed it down
to six peopIe.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.202
WeII, it sounds Iike
everything I've heard
about you is true.

16:12.738 --> 16:13.932
How does Jason fit in?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.906
WeII, the imprint
was from a sports shoe.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.533
The modeI that he donated
to the prison.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.307
I gave them to the inmates
in the gymnastics program.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.015
WeII, then the girI
I'm Iooking for was most
IikeIy in your gym cIass.

16:25.084 --> 16:28.611
I'm sure these aren't
the onIy Sportops
in existence, Mr. Knight.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.623
No, and we've aIso
purchased, what,
200 pairs of sweat socks.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.750
Maybe you'd Iike to know
who's wearing those, too.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.386
No, thanks.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.521
Thanks, anyway.

16:38.597 --> 16:39.825
You bet.
Of course.

16:39.898 --> 16:42.958
Make sure Mr. Knight
has no troubIe
finding his way out.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.805
(woman on PA system)
Attention.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.642
[inmates chattering]

16:58.083 --> 17:00.017
Sorry, sir.
That's against the ruIes.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.278
Okay, no probIem.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.779
Page Roark to caII
the warden's office,
wiII you?

17:03.856 --> 17:04.880
(KITT)
Right away, MichaeI.

17:04.957 --> 17:05.945
[beeps]

17:06.025 --> 17:08.050

17:10.729 --> 17:11.820
Excuse me.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.364
It's okay.
I'II find my way out.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.696
KITT, I'm heading for the gym.
Keep me on video.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.300
(KITT)
Right away, MichaeI.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.359
[beeps]

17:22.273 --> 17:24.538
(MichaeI)
Get a picture of this girI
via comIink.

17:24.609 --> 17:25.838
[camera cIicking]

17:27.146 --> 17:28.374
(MichaeI)
That was terrific.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.476
Wait a minute.
I just want to taIk to you.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.552
I can't taIk to anybody.
RuIes.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.282
I just want to know
if you've ever spent
any time on the outside.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.722
You know, Iike, in a
Work FurIough Program
or something.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.749
No.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.293
Okay, hoId on.
Come on, Iet's go.
Come on, come on.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.993
Now Ieave me aIone
before you get me
into troubIe.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.538
I don't know
what's going on here,
IittIe girI...

17:53.605 --> 17:54.867
but I'm going
to find out.

17:54.940 --> 17:55.998
So why don't you
just teII me--

17:56.075 --> 17:57.064
(Roark)
Knight!

17:57.142 --> 17:59.633
Okay, Knight. Move it.
You're out of here.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.141
Put her in soIitary.
For what?

18:02.514 --> 18:03.947
For taIking to you.

18:04.616 --> 18:05.947
(Roark)
Let's go.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.913
I don't Iike it, Jason.
He saw JuIie.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.353
He suspects it was her.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.947
He can't prove a thing.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.625
It's too far-fetched.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.389
Who's gonna beIieve
we're using prisoners
to puII break-ins?

18:17.463 --> 18:19.226
Knight is not
the kind of guy
that quits.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.198
He'II keep pressing
untiI we stop him.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.358
Time wiII stop him.

18:22.668 --> 18:26.832
We'II be Iong gone with
aII the money we'II ever need
before he figures it out.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.166
We wiII. That's a promise.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.669
Sounds Iike you have
aII the next moves
figured out.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.371
I do. Everything I need
to know is right here. Look.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.678
Which transformer is tied
into the security system...

18:39.318 --> 18:40.876
the pIacement of the aIarm...

18:40.953 --> 18:42.511
aII of the Iaser beams...

18:42.588 --> 18:44.647
and the exact Iocation
of our target.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.618
It's aII there.
It's going to work.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.792
This is the one, Christine.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.361
This is the big one.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.436
(KITT)
She's rather cute,
isn't she, MichaeI?

18:58.504 --> 18:59.562
Cute.

18:59.872 --> 19:00.998
Desperate.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.872
Let's find out
who she is, huh?

19:02.941 --> 19:05.569
Her name is JuIie Rogers.
She's just 20.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.580
Two years ago, she was a
highIy promising member of the
NationaI Gymnastics Team...

19:09.648 --> 19:11.081
that went to the Pan Am Games.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.583
Pan Am Games?

19:12.751 --> 19:14.013
Pan Am Games.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.953
Something happened
when that team came back
into the country, right?

19:17.022 --> 19:20.719
Yes. One of the athIetes
was caught smuggIing
hard drugs through customs.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.953
Her name was--
JuIie Rogers.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.523
And her coach
was Jason NeIson.

19:25.597 --> 19:26.894
That's correct, MichaeI.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.366
NeIson? Sure, I'II teII you
whatever I can.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.027
Just give me a minute
to finish.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.036
And I'II be free
the rest of the day.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.806
UnfortunateIy, I'm not.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.011
(KITT)
And they say there are
no more miracIes Ieft.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.606
Come on, you can do it.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.276
No, it's over.

19:47.619 --> 19:48.745
Fat wins.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.179
Pain wins.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.150
Everything smeIIs Iike fondue.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.921
Nonsense. You've onIy run
1.2 miIes.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.186
What about men?

19:57.262 --> 19:58.456
I'II become a nun.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.623
BIack is sIenderizing!

20:01.166 --> 20:03.191
[grunts]
Gee, I'm so sorry.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.929
Oh, it's okay.

20:05.304 --> 20:06.794
It hurt more to run.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.408
If you want to sue me,
that's okay.

20:10.776 --> 20:11.765
I'm a Iawyer.

20:13.345 --> 20:15.313
[romantic music pIaying]

20:44.943 --> 20:46.137
(KITT)
How deepIy moving.

20:46.211 --> 20:49.408
Someday it'II be my turn.
KITT and the freeway of Iove.

20:51.483 --> 20:54.008
NeIson's a very taIented guy.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.281
AAU championship.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.319
GoId at the NationaIs.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.024
Coached me for a whiIe.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.294
But JuIie was his shot
at coaching the OIympic team.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.956
And when JuIie was arrested,
that was the end of it.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.897
NeIson must have
been devastated.

21:07.966 --> 21:10.867
No, no.
He bIew it before this.

21:11.536 --> 21:15.370
He was caught pushing
performance drugs on his
athIetes and was suspended.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.838
Wait a minute. I don't get it.
He was with JuIie
at the Pan Am Games.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.675
Charges were dropped
and he was reinstated.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.206
Something happened
to the witness
who testified against him.

21:30.989 --> 21:34.152
Things happen to witnesses
who testify against the mob.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.521
Not gymnastic coaches.

21:37.763 --> 21:39.663
Don't judge him
too harshIy, okay?

21:39.731 --> 21:42.256
I mean, he's been
reaI great to JuIie.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.334
He used his connections
to get her transferred
to Gainesboro.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.071
She was assigned to another
prison and he arranged
for a transfer?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.303
Yes, so they couId
continue to work together.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.637
They got one heck
of a routine going down here.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.917
(NeIson)
Go on,
keep it moving.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.016
LittIe bit faster!

22:06.658 --> 22:08.683
Good, good.
Very good.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.093
AIarm.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.747
You just bIew it,
honey.

22:39.591 --> 22:42.185
Find someone eIse.
I just can't do it.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.727
Sure you can.
I can't!

22:43.795 --> 22:45.592
Yes, you can.
I've seen you do it.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.462
The onIy reason you missed
is because you rushed it.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.759
I aIIotted 15 seconds
to the target...

22:50.836 --> 22:53.168
and you did that in,
Iook, just under 9.

22:53.805 --> 22:54.999
You said faster.

22:55.073 --> 22:56.904
You just overreacted,
that's aII.

22:57.609 --> 23:01.067
You're just not sure
of the precise pIacement
of the Iasers, that's aII.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.443
Just some more practice.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.512
You can do it,
can't you?

23:05.450 --> 23:07.577
AII right.
Give me one more.

23:08.453 --> 23:09.511
Come on.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.421
We're this cIose
to miIIions, Jason.

23:16.995 --> 23:17.984
MiIIions.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.127
I've been Iiving inside
these waIIs for too many
years to Iose it aII now.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.965
She'II be aII right,
Christine. Don't worry.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.768
You handpicked her.
You better make sure she is.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.033
She'II puII it off.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.338
You promised me sunshine
and good times.

23:33.311 --> 23:35.006
And I know
you're gonna deIiver.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.337
Aren't you?

23:39.818 --> 23:41.809
Okay, JuIie, get ready.
Let's go up the rope again.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.946
Ready? Go.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.625
(Christine)
You have got
exactIy five seconds...

23:50.695 --> 23:52.094
to get those cIothes off.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.058
Ready, JuIie?

23:54.666 --> 23:55.655
Hurry up.

24:06.878 --> 24:09.506
(KITT)
This road Ieads to
Gainesboro Prison, MichaeI.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.945
They aII do tonight, paI.

24:12.017 --> 24:14.952
I know what you mean.
Brooks' record
reads Iike an inmate's.

24:15.020 --> 24:18.922
Numerous reprimands
for crueI and unorthodox
discipIinary methods.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.457
She's on the brink
of being fired.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.220
Then Iet's push her
over the side.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.762
She made a big deaI
about her computer records.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.457
Access them for me.

24:29.434 --> 24:32.426
I'm in, MichaeI.
But the system has
state-of-the-art safeguards.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.438
I can read the data,
but I can't update it.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.270
That's okay.
Key in on JuIie Rogers.

24:37.342 --> 24:40.106
I want to know
if she's on a Work FurIough
Program or not.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.882
She isn't, MichaeI.
As a matter of fact, she spent
yesterday in soIitary.

24:46.117 --> 24:48.517
Any other inmates
in soIitary yesterday?

24:48.620 --> 24:49.712
Yes, eight of them.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.279
Run their fiIes. I want
mug shots on aII of them.

24:58.597 --> 24:59.962
HoId it. HoId it right there.

25:00.465 --> 25:02.524
That Iooks Iike the pickpocket
who hit Matt.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.601
Samantha Lawton. That's her.

25:05.670 --> 25:09.538
Those girIs got out of prison,
broke into Matt's office,
and went back?

25:09.941 --> 25:11.203
Something Iike that.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.104
Where are they now?
Both Iisted in soIitary.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.339
The pattern hoIds.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.640
They couId be getting ready
for another heist.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.185
Do we have enough evidence
to go to the authorities?

25:21.253 --> 25:23.414
No. Nobody'II beIieve it.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.453
We gotta catch them
in the act, paI.

25:26.057 --> 25:28.719
AII right. Keep the pIace
under surveiIIance.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.988
There is a vehicIe
Ieaving right now, MichaeI.

25:32.063 --> 25:33.724
It couId be them.
Let's move.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.268
(MichaeI)
Are we cIose enough to scan?

25:43.341 --> 25:46.242
(KITT)
Yes, MichaeI. It contains
a driver and three passengers.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.108
But we're stiII too far away
to identify them.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.010
They couId be prisoners
being transferred.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.912
No, no.
Not at this time of night.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.723
Another vehicIe is Ieaving
the prison, MichaeI.

25:59.791 --> 26:00.917
How many inside?

26:00.992 --> 26:02.516
Four as weII, MichaeI.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.652
AII right, it's a toss-up.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.125
Let's foIIow the van
and keep a track
on the vehicIe.

26:31.489 --> 26:33.684
We bIew it, paI. We shouId
have foIIowed the sedan.

Now, JuIie,
you remember.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.006
You give Samantha time
to make her move
before you make yours.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.370

How about showing me
how to use this thing?

29:05.243 --> 29:06.835
(KITT)
MichaeI, Iook out.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.613
[car tires screeching]

29:22.527 --> 29:24.222
[tires screeching]

29:31.035 --> 29:33.026
Come on, Iet's go!
Let's spread out of here!

29:33.104 --> 29:34.696
[tires screeching]

29:36.007 --> 29:37.167
Thanks, buddy.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.003
(KITT)
ShaII I track the sedan,
MichaeI?

29:43.214 --> 29:44.772
Scan his vitaIs first.

29:44.849 --> 29:46.282
[KITT humming]

29:47.852 --> 29:49.285
[beeping]

29:50.355 --> 29:53.153
They're very unstabIe
and deteriorating rapidIy,
MichaeI.

29:53.224 --> 29:54.657
He has a severe concussion.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.593
Yeah, we'd better stay here,
KITT. CaII the paramedics.

30:04.903 --> 30:07.394
How the heII did Knight
get onto you anyway?

30:07.472 --> 30:08.632
How shouId I know?

30:08.706 --> 30:10.037
(NeIson)
ReIax, Christine.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.008
He's a freeIancer
with a hot car.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.909
There's no way
he's gonna connect us
into anything that's happened.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.004
Forget him.
What about that guard?

30:17.615 --> 30:18.877
What if he dies? What if--

30:18.950 --> 30:21.510
That's what happens
to peopIe who get in the way.

30:22.053 --> 30:23.281
They get kiIIed.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.523
It's your concIusion, MichaeI,
that these girIs get out...

30:31.596 --> 30:34.156
commit crimes
and then go back into jaiI.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.729
ExactIy.
It's the perfect aIibi.

30:36.801 --> 30:40.237
One of them is JuIie Rogers,
the gymnast who was busted
for drug smuggIing.

30:40.305 --> 30:42.773
She insisted she'd never
seen the stuff before.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.067
She's doing time anyway.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.675
Sounds Iike the Iady
was set up to take the faII.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.536
NeIson, the prison
athIetic director...

30:49.614 --> 30:51.206
was her coach at the time.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.784
He and Brooks are up to
their necks in this one.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.911
What I faiI to understand
is...

30:56.154 --> 30:59.180
how'd they fit in
to sabotaging
the defense conference.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.155
I don't, either.
None of the pieces fit.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.251
What you got on Brooks,
anything?

31:04.929 --> 31:07.295
She shouId be facing
brutaIity charges.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.427
The witness against her
was AIice Pierson,
JuIie Rogers' ceIImate.

31:11.836 --> 31:14.134
She was kiIIed in a fight
with another inmate.

31:15.406 --> 31:18.739
Something happened
to the witness against NeIson
at the Pan Am Games.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.471
Sounds Iike these peopIe
waste anybody
who get in the way.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.535
Yeah.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.445
And if JuIie's work
is compIeted...

31:25.250 --> 31:26.547
she's next.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.245
(Devon)
Then how do we
draw them out...

31:28.319 --> 31:30.048
and protect JuIie
at the same time?

31:30.688 --> 31:32.178
I got an idea here.

31:33.024 --> 31:35.185
Are you into doing
something a IittIe unusuaI?

31:42.133 --> 31:43.395
[horn honking]

31:43.902 --> 31:47.235
(woman on PA system)
AII inmates,
cIear the west entrance.

31:47.305 --> 31:50.570
Attention, aII inmates.
CIear the west entrance.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.445
[inmates chattering]

32:04.289 --> 32:06.849
Okay, sweetcakes.
End of the Iine.

32:18.303 --> 32:19.429
Thanks for the Iift...

32:20.371 --> 32:21.395
creep.

32:24.575 --> 32:25.735
I'II be cIose.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.770
Here you go.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.149
(Roark)
Admissions Office.
This is Officer Roark.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.024
Just received
Barstow, Bonnie.

32:43.594 --> 32:44.686
1 1 :00 am.

32:44.929 --> 32:48.092
We'II convey to CeII BIock B.
Over and out.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.071
Let's go.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.914
(MichaeI)
So far, so good.
Bonnie's inside.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.013
I don't Iike this pIan,
MichaeI. The peopIe
in that pIace are not nice...

33:12.090 --> 33:13.387
and I don't mean
the prisoners.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.450
Don't worry.
We'II get JuIie and Bonnie
out of there.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.627
AII right. Let's get as cIose
to the west waII as we can.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.455
[engine starting]

33:22.467 --> 33:24.059
[inmates chattering]

33:28.473 --> 33:29.804
Right here, rookie.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.233
You want this?

33:31.309 --> 33:34.039
Hand it over
before I mash your face, okay?

33:34.746 --> 33:37.112
Anytime, sweetcakes.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.170
[grunting]

33:38.816 --> 33:40.613
[inmates cIamoring]

33:42.620 --> 33:44.178
[Roark shouting]

33:51.029 --> 33:53.520
(KITT)
You're cIear, MichaeI.
Bonnie's got them occupied.

33:58.069 --> 33:59.058
Here we go, paI.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.837
[inmates continue cIamoring]

34:30.768 --> 34:33.100
Break up! Break!
Break it up! Come on!

34:33.571 --> 34:35.902
Come on. Break it up.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.406
Break it up.

34:39.777 --> 34:44.407
CongratuIations, Barstow.
You just set a record
for being thrown in soIitary.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.313
We're gonna enjoy
teaching you the ropes.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.478
Put her in the hoIe!

34:54.425 --> 34:56.052
I want to review
her records.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.464
Okay, KITT, you're on.

35:04.836 --> 35:05.928
[KITT humming]

35:11.609 --> 35:12.871
What are you doing here?

35:13.344 --> 35:17.303
I'm trying to stop NeIson
and Brooks from sabotaging
that defense conference.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.043
JuIie, I need your heIp.

35:19.717 --> 35:21.048
Defense conference?

35:22.887 --> 35:24.184
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.189
Now, Iook, this is
no time for games.

35:26.991 --> 35:30.051
I know they framed you
and I know they're forcing you
to work for them.

35:30.528 --> 35:32.052
I'II never get out of here
if I don't.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.257
That's what
AIice Pierson thought.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.697
JuIie, as soon as
they get what they want,
they're gonna kiII you.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.169
This defense conference
couId swing the baIance
of worId power.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.268
That's not
what they're after.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.569
It isn't.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.277
It's an industriaI exhibit
on the top fIoor.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.112
A dispIay of crystaIs.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.215
CrystaIs? Are you sure?

35:55.019 --> 35:56.077
One crystaI.

35:57.021 --> 35:58.045
That's aII they want.

35:58.122 --> 36:01.319
It's got to be a perfect
crystaI. That's the onIy one
worth steaIing.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.194
Do you know that couId
increase the output
of a Iaser by 100?

36:05.229 --> 36:06.992
JuIie, in the wrong hands.

36:08.065 --> 36:09.293
Come on, we're out of here.

36:20.077 --> 36:22.102
There's no record
for Bonnie Barstow.

36:24.615 --> 36:27.015
She's here, Roark.
There has to be
something on her.

36:27.084 --> 36:29.018
There's nothing!
I don't Iike it.

36:29.253 --> 36:31.187
Something's wrong.
You know what I think?

36:31.255 --> 36:33.246
Let's ask Barstow
what she thinks.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.285
Come on.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.364
Come on, MichaeI.

36:54.612 --> 36:55.601
MichaeI.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.876
Okay, KITT, do your thing.

37:01.953 --> 37:02.977
[KITT humming]

37:07.425 --> 37:08.722
Thank you.
It's okay.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.318
Five minutes more in there
and I think I'd be
off the deep end.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.057
[cocking gun]
Think how you'II feeI
after five years.

37:14.131 --> 37:17.032
What, do you promise
these girIs a chance
to get out of prison aIive?

37:17.101 --> 37:18.159
That how it works?

37:18.236 --> 37:19.726
Put them in the ceII.
Both of them.

37:19.804 --> 37:21.738
(Roark)
Come on. Get in there.

37:22.807 --> 37:23.899
Not her.

37:31.115 --> 37:32.104
JuIie.

37:32.683 --> 37:33.843
Now just forget
about them.

37:34.485 --> 37:35.816
It's time
to concentrate.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.311
Today's performance
has to be a 10.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.252
Make sure my car's
at the tunneI exit.

37:44.328 --> 37:46.125
Then get rid of these two.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.769
AII right, KITT,
taIk to me, paI.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.304
(KITT)
How can I heIp you,
MichaeI?

37:54.372 --> 37:56.306
There's gotta be a secret way
out of here.

37:56.707 --> 37:58.766
Locate it,
have RC covered...

37:59.510 --> 38:01.603
then come and get us.
I'II get right on it.

38:03.247 --> 38:04.373
Yeah, get me WaIsh.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.920
WaIsh? Yeah,
Brooks wants her car
in the same pIace as usuaI.

38:09.987 --> 38:10.976
Now.

38:14.492 --> 38:15.823
Okay, KITT, go for it.

38:17.094 --> 38:18.584
[engine starting]

38:23.668 --> 38:27.832
Inmate and accompIice kiIIed

[gun firing]

38:34.312 --> 38:35.404

38:36.847 --> 38:38.314
Come on, Iet's go!

[aIarm bIaring]

39:09.580 --> 39:11.343
[guns firing]

39:19.290 --> 39:23.124
Hi! I'm here to offer you
a Iifetime subscription
to the prison newsIetter.

39:25.830 --> 39:26.922
(KITT)
Where to, MichaeI?

39:27.365 --> 39:28.992
HoteI MaximiIIian.

39:29.066 --> 39:30.328
Super Pursuit Mode.

39:41.078 --> 39:43.069
Now remember,
after I bIow the power...

39:43.147 --> 39:46.810
you're gonna have two minutes
to get that crystaI before
the Iaser aIarm reactivates.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.852
What if it
takes me Ionger?

39:48.919 --> 39:50.386
You'II avoid them.
How?

39:50.454 --> 39:52.786
WeII, just the way
you did in the gym,
in that tumbIing routine.

39:52.857 --> 39:55.985
We pIaced aII of those bars
in the exact positions
as the Iasers.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.960
You've aIready done it
a dozen times.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.757
Now, when you get up
to the top...

39:59.997 --> 40:01.225
be carefuI of the wind.

40:01.599 --> 40:02.588
And, JuIie...

40:02.933 --> 40:04.958
in case you're thinking
about running, don't.

40:05.703 --> 40:08.194
Brooks wouId have you
shot on sight just Iike
your friend MichaeI.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.739
He's.... He's dead?

40:12.343 --> 40:14.504
He won't be showing up
to heIp you this time.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.869
Hey.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.214
Go on in and get us
that crystaI.

40:20.284 --> 40:22.582
And in an hour,
you'II be up
for an earIy paroIe.

40:23.287 --> 40:24.276
AII right?

40:26.357 --> 40:27.381
So, go on.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.619
Go. Go on.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.026
Go on.

43:40.217 --> 43:41.980

44:07.945 --> 44:09.412
AII right,
we're getting cIose.

44:10.047 --> 44:11.207
Back to Cruise Mode.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.684
JuIie couId be Iong gone
by now, MichaeI.

44:20.290 --> 44:21.314
Let's find out.

44:21.592 --> 44:23.560
Scan the upper IeveI
of the hoteI.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.361
(KITT)
I have her. She's rappeIIing
down, MichaeI.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.646
She's going to Iand
on the upper parking area.

44:43.714 --> 44:44.976
(Bonnie)
We'II never reach her in time.

44:45.049 --> 44:46.676
(MichaeI)
One of us can.

44:51.155 --> 44:53.180
Great job, JuIie.
Come on, get in the car.

44:54.358 --> 44:55.416
No.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.755
Come on, hurry up.
It's aII over.

44:57.828 --> 44:59.728
Okay, it's about
25 feet up.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.195
I need aII the pressure
I can get.

45:02.266 --> 45:03.426
Here we go.

45:11.508 --> 45:13.874
JuIie, what's the matter
with you?
NeIson!

45:17.681 --> 45:19.342
[both grunting]

45:42.039 --> 45:43.438
[panting]

45:44.274 --> 45:45.366
MichaeI.

45:48.045 --> 45:49.137
Thanks.

45:49.980 --> 45:51.743
If they gave out medaIs
for guts...

45:52.449 --> 45:53.677
you'd get the goId.

45:54.685 --> 45:55.674
Thank you.

46:27.551 --> 46:29.712
Ta-da!
SpIendid!

46:29.787 --> 46:31.948
Bravo!
You guys.

46:32.322 --> 46:33.346
What do you think, KITT?

46:33.724 --> 46:35.589
(KITT)
A magnificent performance,
MichaeI.

46:35.759 --> 46:36.885
But if I may....

46:36.960 --> 46:37.949
[beeps]

46:41.398 --> 46:45.061
Miss Rogers' Ieft foot
was just a hair behind
on the dismount.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.699
Yeah, with KITT working
on the instant repIay...

46:47.771 --> 46:49.671
you'II be back
to making 10s in no time.

46:49.740 --> 46:52.402
But, remember,
you onIy get him
on aIternate Thursdays.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.341
Thanks.
I reaIIy appreciate it.

46:55.212 --> 46:56.702
It's gonna be a Iong way back.

46:57.014 --> 46:59.346
If you ask me,
you're haIfway there aIready.

47:00.017 --> 47:02.485
(Devon)
And just to make sure you'II
have a smooth journey...

47:02.853 --> 47:04.445
during your
probationary period...

47:04.521 --> 47:06.182
the Foundation
is estabIishing...

47:06.256 --> 47:07.848
the JuIie Rogers'
Training Fund.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.058
