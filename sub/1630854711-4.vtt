00:08.240 --> 00:11.000
<i>Home sweet home.</i>
<i>It's that feeling in Madrid</i>

00:11.080 --> 00:14.760
<i>for Paula Badosa</i>
<i>as the top seed at her home event.</i>

00:14.840 --> 00:18.760
<i>It has been a meteoric rise. Now she finds</i>
<i>herself as the number-two player.</i>

00:30.400 --> 00:35.080
<i>My name is Paula Badosa,</i>
<i>I'm 24 years old. I'm from Spain.</i>

00:40.760 --> 00:44.200
<i>Over the past year,</i>
<i>I played the best tennis of my life.</i>

00:44.280 --> 00:46.560
<i>And I just became world number two.</i>

00:48.640 --> 00:52.560
It's a drug. This sport is a drug.
It's super addictive.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.760
The wins and the feeling that you get,

00:56.560 --> 01:00.080
the adrenaline that it gives you,
you're chasing that all the time.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.800
<i>Good morning from La Caja Mágica.</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:16.560
<i>It's that time of the year</i>

01:16.640 --> 01:19.200
<i>when everybody</i>
<i>turns their attention towards Madrid.</i>

01:19.280 --> 01:21.720
<i>And the start of European</i>
<i>clay court season.</i>

01:24.080 --> 01:25.720
<i>The Madrid Open is</i>

01:25.800 --> 01:27.600
<i>one of the biggest tournaments</i>
<i>of the season</i>

01:27.680 --> 01:30.080
<i>on the men's and women's tours.</i>

01:30.800 --> 01:35.800
<i>The distinctive red clay makes this a firm</i>
<i>favorite for fans and players alike.</i>

01:36.400 --> 01:39.480
Clay is more challenging
than other surfaces.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.640
The balls get heavier.
It's way harder to hit a winner.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.080
And you need to know how to slide.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.400
You see a lot more players

01:48.480 --> 01:52.040
using all the tools they have in their box
to try to win points.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.560
Got to love clay, it's so dirty here.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.920
All the top players are there.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.880
The draw is absolutely packed.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.760
And it's high pressure.

02:07.120 --> 02:11.400
If you win Madrid, then you put yourself
in a significant position

02:11.480 --> 02:14.120
for the rest of the season globally.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.720
Thanks, Paula.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.560
<i>In the women's draws,</i>

02:19.640 --> 02:21.920
<i>there are plenty of contenders</i>
<i>looking to lift the trophy,</i>

02:22.000 --> 02:24.880
<i>which makes this year</i>
<i>particularly exciting.</i>

02:24.960 --> 02:28.360
<i>On the one hand, you've got top players</i>
<i>like former Grand Slam champion</i>

02:28.440 --> 02:30.560
<i>and Madrid winner, Simona Halep.</i>

02:32.280 --> 02:36.240
<i>And Paula Badosa, who's current favorite</i>
<i>to win her home tournament.</i>

02:37.000 --> 02:39.040
<i>But there are disruptors here</i>

02:39.120 --> 02:42.920
<i>that could cause an upset,</i>
<i>like Maria Sakkari,</i>

02:43.000 --> 02:47.240
<i>and you've got Jessica Pegula,</i>
<i>and Ons Jabeur.</i>

02:47.320 --> 02:51.600
<i>None have had a big win</i>
<i>yet, so they're all hungry for a title.</i>

02:53.200 --> 02:57.320
<i>So, tricky to call</i>
<i>who's going to be crowned queen of Madrid.</i>

03:01.880 --> 03:03.120
Hi, Paula.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.080
Playing in Madrid,
having become recently number two…

03:06.160 --> 03:08.960
Does it add extra pressure
to you for the tournament?

03:09.840 --> 03:13.480
It's totally different to be
number 70 than to be number two.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.920
You are more exposed, the pressure is on.
So I have to learn how to manage it,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.680
because in my case,
everything happened very fast.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.080
Paula Badosa has been
an absolute rocket up the rankings

03:26.160 --> 03:27.480
over the last year.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.560
On top of that, she has that
kind of CoverGirl look about her.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.840
Six feet tall,
about as perfect as you can get.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.920
And she's got her supermodel boyfriend.

03:42.920 --> 03:47.600
I saw her for the first time on Instagram.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.760
I thought she was pretty,
she caught my attention

03:51.840 --> 03:54.520
and I started following her from that day.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.760
One of the qualities I like best about her
is that she is a strong person.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.800
She is one of the strongest women
I have ever met.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.960
What a present she gave me here.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.480
She's always fighting for her dream.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.680
I think a lot of people that
see me on social media, on Instagram,

04:21.760 --> 04:25.000
they think that my life
and everything is perfect.

04:25.079 --> 04:29.120
But of course it's not.
I'm living a dream.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.600
But at the same time,

04:30.680 --> 04:33.880
it's not easy to manage with all
the expectations, all the pressure.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.560
The first ten minutes they're just
gonna show you around…

04:40.640 --> 04:42.160
-Okay.
-…give you a tour of the space.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.440
They did a big contest to see

04:44.520 --> 04:48.280
one lucky person is going to get
to rally over a small net with you.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.640
Some tennis coach won it,
but he wants to give it to…

04:51.720 --> 04:55.240
I guess there's some girl at his academy
that's a huge fan of yours.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.520
-Okay.
-So, she's seven years old.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.400
-So cute.
-She didn't sleep last night.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.120
Really?

05:05.840 --> 05:06.880
Hello.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.040
Who's going to win?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.600
Very good. Bye, champion.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.920
I don't like that you beat me!

05:21.760 --> 05:23.560
Sponsors and money.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.480
It's important
because it brings this financial security.

05:28.480 --> 05:34.720
Women tennis players are still striving
for equal prize money to men.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.880
And they're still striving
to get equal airtime on TV.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.800
I think women tennis players are striving

05:44.880 --> 05:49.960
to just have that recognition
that male athletes have.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.960
I need to live like,
so many things this week for…

05:53.040 --> 05:56.120
I've played several tournaments
where they're joint events

05:56.200 --> 05:58.560
and I'm making significantly less.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.440
Even I got people come up to me and say,

06:01.520 --> 06:05.080
"O my God, you won that tournament
and they made that much and you only…?"

06:05.160 --> 06:06.200
You know, that's bullshit.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.120
-How are you?
-Good.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.360
Ultimately, the reason
you're getting these opportunities is…

06:14.960 --> 06:16.160
because you're a champion.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.080
-Are you going to blow the balloon up?
-Yes.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.160
You get a sponsorship and you think
it's forever, but guess what? It's not.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.520
It's not forever unless you keep winning.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.640
People don't realize how difficult
it is financially for tennis players.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.600
When you come from a rich country,

06:35.680 --> 06:39.240
the financial contract with the sponsors
are much bigger.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.040
Because the market is bigger.

06:41.840 --> 06:45.720
When you come from a little country,
it's a disaster.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.560
-Aboullah, when are you arriving?
-When are you coming, Adel?

07:13.640 --> 07:17.240
My name is Ons Jabeur. I am from Tunisia

07:17.320 --> 07:19.200
and I'm 27 years old.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.880
I'm a dreamer.
And my dream is to win a major title.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.560
-Maybe after a while…
-OK.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.640
-I'll tell you later.
-Okay.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.760
Ons.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.160
-Ons.
-Mumi.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.280
I always believed that I could be
a professional tennis player.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.000
But a tennis player coming from Tunisia,
that was a different thing.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.880
Should I add more?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.560
It's so good.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.640
Ons coming from
and representing

07:57.720 --> 08:00.480
the Arab and the African nations

08:00.560 --> 08:04.400
is doing something
that nobody else has ever done.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.080
People thought
that I would be quitting tennis,

08:08.160 --> 08:10.480
that I would be a housewife.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.760
But I always believed in my dream.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.720
To come from nowhere,

08:15.800 --> 08:20.040
without any resources,
without investments,

08:20.120 --> 08:23.480
and getting past all the barriers

08:23.560 --> 08:25.800
and the significance of what that means

08:25.880 --> 08:28.560
for her country,
for herself, for her family…

08:28.640 --> 08:30.040
It's incredible.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.920
When I was playing tennis with my friends,

08:36.000 --> 08:41.200
she was telling me,
"Mom, you have to win. Do it."

08:41.280 --> 08:43.440
I was such a wise child.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.159
I was competitive
from the age of three years old.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.600
I hate losing. I always wanted to win.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.760
Even playing a card game.
She always wants to win.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.320
To say that you want to win
a major title, people will laugh at you.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.040
People will say, "No, you cannot do it."

09:07.800 --> 09:10.240
So I need to believe even more in myself.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.640
From the moment you start
your career, the clock is ticking.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.800
And Ons is 27.

09:16.880 --> 09:21.160
She has broken last year into the top ten.
Now she's world number eight.

09:22.240 --> 09:28.600
Ons is at the stage of her career
where she really needs to win a big title.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.400
Are they recording you or me?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.440
-Both.
-Okay.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.680
Give me the ball please.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.200
Slice.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.680
When you don't go for it, I take control.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.600
Ons's team is made up
of her coach, Issam,

09:58.680 --> 10:00.680
and her husband, Karim.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.200
She really wanted to build out
a full Tunisian team.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.720
But is that going to get
the best out of you?

10:07.800 --> 10:10.600
Listen! Hit it hard.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.640
I think people kinda thought,
"You're only going to get that

10:14.720 --> 10:18.360
if you go to the countries
that have historically pumped out

10:18.440 --> 10:20.120
the top-level coaches."

10:20.720 --> 10:23.920
That's how you're going to find
your blueprint to success.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.160
So people they did judge us
and they didn't believe in our team.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.080
People didn't think
that we are a great team together.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.160
They didn't believe in our capacity
to be top 30, top 20, top 10.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.800
But Issam and Karim really get me.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.520
And we have the same goals.
We want to break barriers.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.280
-Can I use your pen?
-Yeah.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.040
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.120
We're like
the three musketeers from Tunisia.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.240
I like to think that, you know.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.440
One, two, three, yeah!

11:10.600 --> 11:13.880
<i>First day of the Mutua Madrid Open.</i>

11:17.680 --> 11:19.920
<i>It's going to be a busy one here today.</i>

11:20.000 --> 11:24.760
<i>Starting with this enticing encounter</i>
<i>between Badosa and Kudermetova.</i>

11:27.520 --> 11:29.840
<i>Badosa knows</i>
<i>what she has to do.</i>

11:29.920 --> 11:32.440
<i>There's a bit of pressure</i>
<i>on her shoulders.</i>

11:38.160 --> 11:41.040
<i>There you go.</i>
<i>Everything's starting to click now.</i>

11:42.440 --> 11:44.440
-Come on, Paula.
-Come on, Paula.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.360
<i>She's on the doorstep. Match point.</i>

11:52.200 --> 11:54.760
<i>What a performance</i>
<i>from Badosa in the second set.</i>

11:54.840 --> 11:57.360
<i>She did not lose a point on serve.</i>

11:57.440 --> 12:01.240
<i>You want to feel that feeling</i>
<i>of winning, winning and winning.</i>

12:01.960 --> 12:04.520
<i>That's one of the reasons</i>
<i>that you keep playing,</i>

12:04.600 --> 12:07.080
<i>because you want</i>
<i>that feeling all the time.</i>

12:08.120 --> 12:09.120
Thank you.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.200
<i>Up next, another first-round battle.</i>

12:14.280 --> 12:16.960
<i>Jasmine Paolini</i>
<i>faces off against Ons Jabeur.</i>

12:18.760 --> 12:21.400
<i>Ons has had a mixed season so far.</i>

12:21.480 --> 12:24.440
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>if she can turn it around here today.</i>

12:38.440 --> 12:41.640
She's a breath of fresh air
in how she plays. Very imaginative.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.360
Slice backhand.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.160
Mixes it up, comes to the net, drop shots.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.240
She's unpredictable.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.160
<i>That is what she does.</i>

12:55.240 --> 12:56.880
<i>Opening set, Ons Jabeur.</i>

12:58.000 --> 12:59.600
When I look at Ons, I think,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.760
that I wouldn't have matched up
well against her.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.400
She would have been a nightmare
to play against.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.520
<i>Wow.</i>

13:08.600 --> 13:10.320
<i>Creative genius.</i>

13:10.400 --> 13:14.400
Thank God I'm retired
because that slice, oh God.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.600
I'd have nightmares about it.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.240
When you go to a match
of Ons Jabeur,

13:21.320 --> 13:23.760
you know that you're going to have fun.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.760
<i>Jabeur. Match point.</i>

13:34.040 --> 13:36.400
<i>Oh. That's brilliant.</i>

13:37.240 --> 13:41.000
<i>The number-eight seed</i>
<i>books a place in the round of 32.</i>

13:50.640 --> 13:52.880
This is his time to take revenge.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.880
As a husband, not as a fitness coach.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.600
Are you filming the torture?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.440
For a player like Ons,

14:01.520 --> 14:03.960
the journey has been
extremely challenging.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.160
Because if you don't have enough money

14:06.240 --> 14:08.680
to pay for a coach,
there's no way you can compete.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.520
Ons was struggling a little bit
with the fitness coaches

14:13.600 --> 14:16.960
and it was costing a lot of money for her.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.200
She told me,

14:19.280 --> 14:22.960
"Can you please travel with me
and help me with the fitness side?"

14:23.040 --> 14:24.080
So I said, "Okay."

14:25.160 --> 14:28.720
I need to help my wife.
Her dream is my dream.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.680
Let's see what the future is bringing.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.960
-Now you're cheating.
-Did you hear that?

14:41.800 --> 14:46.920
It was a big risk to take to mix
professional and personal life together.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.440
We struggled a lot at the beginning.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.120
For example, I threw the medicine ball
just a little bit far from her.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.080
He threw the medicine ball
like this far from me.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.840
I complained about it.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.640
She said, "Don't tell me what to do."
"Catch it? No, don't tell me to catch it."

15:05.240 --> 15:08.240
I was like, "You can't throw."
He's like, "You can't catch."

15:08.320 --> 15:11.160
It was a mess. We stopped
even the training because of that.

15:11.880 --> 15:16.920
"Okay Ons, stop. We need to discuss.
We need to have like a small meeting."

15:18.000 --> 15:21.320
It's not going to work,
so… we put like rules.

15:24.280 --> 15:27.560
Ladies and gentlemen, here we have
Ons Jabeur on the screen, sorry.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.320
-Are you sure you're having me?
-Yeah, you're on the screen.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.600
Ons, I have a question for you.

15:32.680 --> 15:36.440
-No cameras, please.
-Wait. I have a question.

15:36.520 --> 15:41.360
Tell me more about babies.
I know that you like kids and babies.

15:41.920 --> 15:46.200
And I know that
you are in love with your niece.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.920
Yeah. I love babies. We both do.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.400
-And hopefully one day we can have a…
-A child of our own.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.600
-A mini Karim or a mini Ons.
-Little Ons.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.600
-Uh, we both cannot wait for that day.
-Okay.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.440
It will be a victory for both of us.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.680
Okay. Do you think
you will put her on tennis?

16:10.440 --> 16:13.560
I want to let her…
Why her? I want a boy.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.960
He's trying to trick me.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.240
No, but it's a…

16:21.120 --> 16:22.800
It's one of our goals.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.840
-Hopefully, after…
-After a good career.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.360
-Yeah.
-Yeah. One step at a time.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.840
Women do a lot of sacrifices.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.080
If you want to have a child,
you can't just go and have a child.

16:45.160 --> 16:49.200
You have to sacrifice that.
You have to sacrifice something you love.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.080
A family for a career.

16:52.160 --> 16:55.720
I wish I was a man.
Just, "I want to have a baby." Done.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.000
I have a better angle here. Okay, Ons.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.880
Oh, now he knows about the angles. Wow.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.360
Such a heavy camera.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.280
-Ready for tomorrow?
-I don't know. We'll see.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.560
Yes. Always positive, Ons Jabeur.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.119
Women's tennis is incredibly physical.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.319
You can't just hop back on tour
and everything's the same.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.680
Your body has changed.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.200
In the history of tennis, only three women
have been able to have kids

17:23.280 --> 17:28.240
and then come back and win Grand Slams.
So it's a really big decision.

17:32.359 --> 17:34.880
-Paula Badosa. How are you?
-Hi, how are you?

17:34.960 --> 17:37.920
She's world's number two in tennis.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.480
It's a dream come true
to be among the two best in the world.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.080
Next is number one.

17:44.160 --> 17:47.600
Of course.
But let's start with number two.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.240
Of course. What's your goal in Madrid?

17:50.320 --> 17:53.960
I have a dream. I'd love to win in Madrid.

17:54.960 --> 17:59.560
I'll fight and give it my all.
At least I've got this chance.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.440
There's being a favorite at a tournament

18:05.520 --> 18:08.000
and there's being a favorite
at your home tournament.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.960
Everyone has a different way
of handling pressure.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.320
I could never be overly confident.
It never worked for me.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.480
I wanted to show up
as if I had never won anything.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.280
That's the way
that I was able to function.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.440
<i>Coming up next,</i>
<i>second-round coverage</i>

18:34.520 --> 18:36.240
<i>of the Mutua Madrid Open.</i>

18:37.240 --> 18:41.000
<i>Thirty-two women will</i>
<i>compete for a place in the next round.</i>

18:47.960 --> 18:51.920
<i>Simona Halep and</i>
<i>Paula Badosa clash for the first time.</i>

18:53.640 --> 18:55.800
There's a lot of things
that affect you

18:55.880 --> 18:57.960
when you're going to go to play.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.160
You're the home favorite,
you have expectations.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.880
<i>The Romanian, Simona Halep.</i>

19:07.960 --> 19:10.560
<i>Grand Slam champion Simona Halep</i>

19:10.640 --> 19:13.280
<i>has two Madrid titles</i>
<i>under her belt already,</i>

19:13.360 --> 19:16.040
<i>and she'll be looking to add a third.</i>

19:16.800 --> 19:19.600
She's a tough player. She's a fighter.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.320
So it's a big challenge.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.200
<i>Paula Badosa.</i>

19:26.760 --> 19:29.880
<i>Bit of a home court</i>
<i>advantage in many ways for the Spaniard.</i>

19:31.680 --> 19:34.320
<i>She said, "I feel a bit of the pressure."</i>
<i>But I'm expecting a lift,</i>

19:34.400 --> 19:37.320
<i>particularly tonight</i>
<i>against the former world number one.</i>

19:52.280 --> 19:56.440
<i>Is Badosa gonna have</i>
<i>enough power to overpower Helep?</i>

19:58.080 --> 19:59.840
She's playing unbelievable.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.000
But I'm playing on a good level as well.

20:13.560 --> 20:17.320
<i>She's come back from a</i>
<i>two-love deficit to move ahead three-two.</i>

20:23.120 --> 20:26.640
I'm nervous.
Maybe a little bit more than usual.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.960
<i>Set point.</i>

20:36.640 --> 20:38.840
<i>A quality start for Simona Halep.</i>

20:39.760 --> 20:42.720
When you're playing as a favorite,
you play with pressure,

20:42.800 --> 20:44.880
so maybe
you don't play at your best level.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.920
<i>She's feeling the pressure from Halep.</i>

20:52.440 --> 20:53.800
<i>She's suffocating.</i>

20:55.000 --> 20:57.040
Mentally I'm blocked.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.040
I'm struggling so much.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.560
I just can't find my level.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.840
I really want to leave the court.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.320
I have so many negative voices in my head.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.080
"You're a bad player."

21:38.880 --> 21:40.520
"You're not able to do this."

21:41.640 --> 21:43.840
It's very tough to turn it off.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.120
It's tough seeing her suffer so much.

21:49.200 --> 21:54.480
She is at the limit of her emotions,
stress, everything.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.960
But there's nothing else you can do.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.920
<i>She's having</i>
<i>a hard time just holding on to her tears.</i>

22:08.920 --> 22:12.560
<i>Halep has been</i>
<i>unrelenting. Looking to snuff out Badosa.</i>

22:13.200 --> 22:14.520
<i>Match point.</i>

22:22.600 --> 22:24.840
<i>Game, set and match…</i>

22:24.920 --> 22:27.400
<i>If you want to beat</i>
<i>the elite, you have to bring your best.</i>

22:27.480 --> 22:28.760
<i>Six-three, six-one.</i>

22:28.840 --> 22:31.840
<i>And Simona Halep</i>
<i>has upended the world number two</i>

22:31.920 --> 22:36.040
<i>in an hour and 16 minutes.</i>
<i>She dismisses Badosa 6-3, 6-1.</i>

22:43.800 --> 22:47.320
It's tough. Very tough for me.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.440
In Madrid, in my hometown.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.800
Very emotional.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.640
Fuck.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.320
This has happened to me before.

23:06.520 --> 23:11.120
I've been struggling for years
with a lot of depression.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.520
When I was 17,
I won the Junior French Open.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.800
This is a lot of motivation
winning a tournament like this.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.080
It's amazing for me.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.120
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.480
People were talking about me
like I was the next big thing,

23:37.560 --> 23:39.520
the next Maria Sharapova.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.560
I felt like, "Wow, now I have
to be a legend."

23:42.640 --> 23:45.440
"Maybe next year
I have to be a top-ten player."

23:46.440 --> 23:49.240
So for me it was a lot of pressure.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.800
Paula Badosa
had early success as a junior,

23:55.880 --> 23:59.680
but she struggled to kind
of break through, struggled to get wins.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.400
<i>What a pity.</i>

24:04.160 --> 24:07.720
It was very tough for me. because
I didn't know what to do in that moment.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.760
Life didn't have a lot of sense.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.840
Because ever since I was seven years old,

24:18.680 --> 24:21.320
my dream was to be
a professional tennis player.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.600
It was very bad.
I didn't want to go on a tennis court.

24:29.440 --> 24:34.840
I started to try to find solutions to work
on it, with mental health professionals.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.520
So yeah, that helped for sure.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.200
I've been very, very open in the press

24:44.280 --> 24:47.080
and everywhere
about my mental health struggles

24:47.160 --> 24:50.600
because even the best athlete
in the world can feel this.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.840
Hello, Paula.
We'll start with questions…

24:52.920 --> 24:56.320
I'm in a position right now that
if I talk, maybe I can help other people.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.400
Paula Badosa was one of the first players

24:59.480 --> 25:05.680
to really openly discuss really
how difficult depression was in her life.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.200
And that really makes her
one of the trailblazers in this space.

25:10.680 --> 25:13.000
I think it shows
an incredible amount of bravery.

25:13.080 --> 25:17.280
You're in a position where you don't want
to show weaknesses to other players.

25:17.960 --> 25:21.120
You want to seem completely impenetrable.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
A lot of people don't talk about it

25:25.280 --> 25:28.160
because they think
that they're going to be weaker,

25:28.720 --> 25:31.480
but I think it's totally the opposite.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.560
Welcome home.

25:39.880 --> 25:44.160
I'm fighting a lot mentally
to try to find myself again.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.880
My team, they're with me 24/7.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.320
Thank you so much.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.440
Thanks. See you.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.680
Every time that I'm thinking about
something negative, I have them.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
"You missed doing 100 more squats
before the game, damn it!"

26:06.480 --> 26:08.280
"For fuck's sake."

26:08.360 --> 26:10.720
They help me on and off court.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.160
If I'm not having that good day

26:13.240 --> 26:15.680
or mentally I'm struggling,
they're there for me.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.640
I was very concerned.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.240
Hm.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.640
Um, right now, from 0 to 10…
How are you?

26:31.720 --> 26:35.520
It depends on the moment.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.840
You know the angel and the devil…?
Well, that's where I am.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.640
With that internal fight… Constantly.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.920
When I'm okay,
I feel like home on those courts.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.800
And I feel like this is my place.

26:49.880 --> 26:55.000
But I go from that to
''Get me out of here, I want to die.''

27:01.600 --> 27:08.240
Pau, with what you're saying…
The next time this happens, we must stop.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.720
Let's make this experience useful
for the future to say,

27:11.800 --> 27:14.240
"At this point
it is better not to compete."

27:18.080 --> 27:19.920
Just go home, take a break.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.440
-Be…
-It's my own fault.

27:23.520 --> 27:29.200
My mistake for thinking, ''If there's 1%
chance to win, you never know.''

27:29.280 --> 27:32.800
We're a team for the good and for the bad.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.440
-We will always be there, right?
-Yeah.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.720
I'm really grateful
to have good people by my side.

27:44.320 --> 27:48.360
They care about how I am
before the player that I am.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.960
I'm going to fight to be
one of the best players in the world.

27:55.680 --> 27:59.480
And I hope one day we can all make
our dreams come true.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.480
<i>Welcome back to quarter finals day</i>

28:14.560 --> 28:17.480
<i>at the Aranxa Sánchez Stadium</i>
<i>here in Madrid.</i>

28:23.960 --> 28:26.920
<i>With home favorite Paula Badosa</i>
<i>out of the draw,</i>

28:27.000 --> 28:28.760
<i>the competition is wide open.</i>

28:34.120 --> 28:35.480
Come on, guys.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.360
Just going to continue and keep pushing.

28:37.440 --> 28:41.080
I'll try my best here
to compete with the great champions.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.240
<i>Ons will now face</i>
<i>former Grand Slam champion</i>

28:47.320 --> 28:49.480
<i>Simona Halep in the quarter finals.</i>

28:51.320 --> 28:53.680
Simona is a great player, you know.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.440
She's never easy to beat.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.880
And she just knocked out Paula Badosa,
number two in the world.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.680
So definitely it's going to be
a difficult match.

29:11.800 --> 29:15.520
<i>Jabeur gets things</i>
<i>underway for a spot in the final four.</i>

29:20.680 --> 29:22.680
Nothing's going to come easy.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.880
To win a point,
you have to really go for it.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.120
<i>Ons Jabeur. Mighty.</i>

29:41.840 --> 29:44.800
<i>She has the best drop shot in the game.</i>

29:44.880 --> 29:47.000
<i>It's a thing of beauty.</i>

29:48.400 --> 29:52.000
<i>Jabeur finishes strong</i>
<i>to take the opening set.</i>

29:56.480 --> 29:58.600
<i>Just marveling at her ability.</i>

29:59.440 --> 30:01.520
<i>It feels like something's clicked.</i>

30:10.880 --> 30:12.120
<i>Match point.</i>

30:18.480 --> 30:22.920
<i>Jabeur sees off two-time Madrid champion</i>
<i>Simona Halep in straight sets.</i>

30:24.080 --> 30:27.240
You guys are good luck.
Always when you come, I win.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.120
Congratulations on your win
against a very formidable opponent.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.840
<i>The Tunisian</i>
<i>Ons Jabeur, the player to avoid.</i>

30:36.480 --> 30:38.760
-Good luck tomorrow.
-Thank you.

30:38.840 --> 30:42.320
You've had
an amazing run. How does it feel?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.360
Honestly, a dream coming true.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.080
<i>She's now meeting</i>
<i>Yekaterina Aleksándrova</i>

30:50.160 --> 30:51.600
<i>in the semi finals.</i>

30:56.480 --> 30:59.920
<i>The Tunisian,</i>
<i>right now, is at the height of her game.</i>

31:01.240 --> 31:02.680
<i>Match point.</i>

31:06.320 --> 31:08.080
<i>And there you have it.</i>

31:08.160 --> 31:12.360
<i>The talented Tunisian finds her way</i>
<i>to the final in Madrid.</i>

31:13.680 --> 31:17.640
<i>How about this? For the first time,</i>
<i>the continent of Africa</i>

31:17.720 --> 31:21.560
<i>now has a woman reach a WTA 1000 final.</i>

31:22.640 --> 31:24.480
<i>Her name? Ons Jabeur.</i>

31:42.280 --> 31:43.360
Next.

31:44.680 --> 31:47.440
Well done!

31:48.760 --> 31:50.240
Next. Who's next? No?

32:00.600 --> 32:03.160
The final is a big day for me.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.040
I think they're here.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.440
I'm playing one of the biggest matches
of my life.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.680
The family is here.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.280
Oh God!

32:18.880 --> 32:21.000
My family is here to support me.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.040
How are you?

32:26.440 --> 32:27.440
Mino.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.600
Come here. Wow, come here.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.480
Give me a kiss.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.080
I play the final tomorrow.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.280
Being surrounded by my family,
seeing my niece, is unbelievable.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.560
She takes the stress a little bit away.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.720
<i>The last day in Madrid.</i>

33:05.600 --> 33:07.240
<i>Just two remain.</i>

33:07.880 --> 33:12.040
<i>Ons Jabeur will now be facing</i>
<i>Jessica Pegula in the women's final.</i>

33:13.480 --> 33:15.440
Ons, congratulations.

33:15.520 --> 33:19.360
First African player
to ever reach a 1000 final.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.880
You must just be elated.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.800
Um, I know…

33:22.880 --> 33:25.040
The smile coming on your face
when you're talking about the final.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.040
I'm going to put all the effort,

33:27.120 --> 33:31.000
every great drop shot that I do,
every great forehand in the match.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.240
You're not only going
for the biggest title of your life,

33:34.320 --> 33:35.800
but it would be historic.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.240
And you're doing it with style.
We cannot wait to watch you…

33:38.320 --> 33:41.200
-Thank you.
-…in that final. Tremendously well done.

33:41.280 --> 33:44.880
<i>I feel like all the</i>
<i>players like Jabeur, fans, journalists,</i>

33:44.960 --> 33:47.600
<i>everyone's kind of rooting for her</i>
<i>to do this.</i>

33:48.960 --> 33:50.720
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.520
She's a hell of a player, Pegula.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.880
She hits so clean. It's incredible.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.200
She's very, very dangerous.

34:04.280 --> 34:09.920
On one shot, she can put you
two meters away from the ball like that.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.560
What is most tricky about playing Ons?

34:15.440 --> 34:19.239
She's very unorthodox.
She plays different than other girls.

34:19.760 --> 34:23.880
Some girls you can play over and over
again. Their strategy is kind of similar.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.679
But she's definitely
not going to roll over.

34:28.679 --> 34:32.360
<i>Ons Jabeur has been</i>
<i>forging a path, producing numerous firsts.</i>

34:32.440 --> 34:35.000
<i>First-time achievements</i>
<i>for players from Tunisia,</i>

34:35.080 --> 34:37.520
<i>players from Africa and for Arab women.</i>

34:38.440 --> 34:40.880
This is the first time
that she reached the final

34:40.960 --> 34:42.760
of such a big tournament.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.920
<i>Jessica Pegula!</i>

34:46.280 --> 34:48.920
<i>Jessica Pegula</i>
<i>has been yearning for this chance</i>

34:49.000 --> 34:50.480
<i>for the championship.</i>

34:51.280 --> 34:53.000
<i>Ons Jabeur!</i>

34:56.239 --> 35:00.280
<i>The 27-year-old who has</i>
<i>captured the tennis world with her smile.</i>

35:06.440 --> 35:09.880
I'm so stressed.
They don't know how much I'm stressed.

35:12.440 --> 35:17.520
I tried to not show it to her,
but inside I'm having a heart attack.

35:19.880 --> 35:20.880
<i>Ready.</i>

35:21.600 --> 35:22.760
<i>Play.</i>

35:39.440 --> 35:42.760
<i>Oh. Jabeur virtually</i>
<i>owns the drop shot.</i>

35:42.840 --> 35:44.800
<i>But Jessica's not bad at it herself.</i>

35:46.920 --> 35:50.520
She's playing really well.
Very aggressive.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.400
I am starting very slow.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.640
<i>Four-one down in the first set.</i>

36:03.720 --> 36:06.920
<i>It's really starting</i>
<i>to get under the skin of Jabeur.</i>

36:07.000 --> 36:09.520
<i>Maybe putting</i>
<i>too much pressure on herself.</i>

36:09.600 --> 36:11.520
Focus on your game. Go.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.720
Good work. Well done, Ons.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.960
<i>Much better from Jabeur.</i>

36:26.000 --> 36:27.840
Then I find my rhythm.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.560
<i>Game, Jabeur.</i>

36:33.320 --> 36:36.440
<i>Just amazing. Look at that smile.</i>

36:37.560 --> 36:40.160
<i>Good turnaround this from Ons Jabeur.</i>

36:48.800 --> 36:52.080
<i>Marvelous.</i>
<i>Ons Jabeur takes the opening set.</i>

36:57.000 --> 37:00.960
<i>Pegula is injecting</i>
<i>more power into her strokes.</i>

37:01.040 --> 37:03.640
<i>Pegula leads by two games to love.</i>

37:05.760 --> 37:08.920
She starts playing amazing.
Like boom, boom, boom, you know?

37:11.160 --> 37:14.200
<i>Pegula being very aggressive right now.</i>

37:14.280 --> 37:17.240
She's putting every ball in
and that kinda bothered me a lot.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.240
The game is going
very, very fast.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.920
She's killing me.

37:27.800 --> 37:33.480
She's not playing the way she has
since the beginning of the tournament.

37:34.240 --> 37:38.840
You don't recognize her.
It's not Ons anymore on the court.

37:38.920 --> 37:42.880
-What more can I do?
-It's okay.

37:43.960 --> 37:47.920
<i>Things have gone</i>
<i>just inexplicably haywire in this set.</i>

37:50.640 --> 37:52.880
I don't want
to see her struggling.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.280
She's not only my player.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.600
She's also my wife.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.720
I don't want to see her like this.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.920
-Go, Ons!
-Go, sister!

38:06.000 --> 38:08.960
You are the boss. Attack without fear.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.320
<i>Last set.</i>

38:11.520 --> 38:12.920
<i>Play.</i>

38:20.000 --> 38:21.600
This is not happening.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.560
My family didn't come
all the way for this.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.200
Bravo, Ons. Go ahead.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.320
Karim didn't do all this for nothing.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.520
<i>Jabeur is like,</i>
<i>"I am not losing this match."</i>

38:35.600 --> 38:37.440
I pressed the reset button.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.880
<i>Two games away.</i>

38:42.960 --> 38:46.720
If I have the slightest opportunity,
I try to take it.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.000
<i>Six points in a row lost by Pegula.</i>

38:55.640 --> 38:57.560
<i>Ons Jabeur</i>
<i>with a chance now</i>

38:57.640 --> 39:00.480
<i>to be the first Arab woman</i>
<i>to raise the trophy</i>

39:00.560 --> 39:02.520
<i>at a tournament of this magnitude.</i>

39:02.600 --> 39:04.480
<i>Serving for the glory in Madrid.</i>

39:14.600 --> 39:16.440
<i>Game, set and match, Jabeur!</i>

39:28.240 --> 39:29.720
I can't believe it.

39:31.560 --> 39:36.280
<i>Things have gotten real</i>
<i>in Madrid for Ons Jabeur. Champion!</i>

39:37.440 --> 39:38.600
It's crazy.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.360
I'm just so happy.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.400
I wanted to scream so loud.

39:56.800 --> 40:00.840
I really want to thank my team
for the hard work you've been doing.

40:00.920 --> 40:04.480
Thank you, guys, for always believing
in me and pushing me forward.

40:05.560 --> 40:09.080
I'm thankful for my family
who came here to support me today.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.800
<i>Lifting that trophy.</i>

40:14.880 --> 40:17.280
<i>See the joy on Ons Jabeur's face.</i>

40:18.440 --> 40:21.480
<i>Again, a reminder for the woman</i>
<i>who has done so much for Tunisia</i>

40:21.560 --> 40:25.480
<i>and for the Arab world</i>
<i>and women across the globe.</i>

40:27.440 --> 40:30.120
<i>Ons Jabeur blazed a trail to victory.</i>

40:33.640 --> 40:38.440
It's something unbelievable.
It's like something very magical.

40:44.280 --> 40:47.200
Getting this title is all I've worked for.

40:48.360 --> 40:52.120
This is a big, big step that will make me
believe more in myself,

40:52.200 --> 40:54.720
and makes me believe
that I can win a Grand Slam.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.360
<i>Welcome to Roland-Garros.</i>

41:01.440 --> 41:03.600
<i>The second Grand Slam of the year.</i>

41:04.640 --> 41:06.840
<i>Thirteen-time Roland-Garros champion.</i>

41:06.920 --> 41:08.880
<i>The King of Clay.</i>

41:09.640 --> 41:13.080
Who even has the potential
to stop Rafa at Roland-Garros?

41:14.400 --> 41:17.360
I believe I have what it takes
to win Grand Slams

41:17.440 --> 41:18.960
and be number one in the world.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.160
You eat tennis, you drink tennis,
you shit tennis.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.440
Félix is a prodigy,

41:25.520 --> 41:28.760
but he needs to find something
to take him to the next level.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.280
I'm Rafael Nadal's uncle.

41:31.360 --> 41:34.480
I like being a teacher.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.080
Very good.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.360
<i>Félix Auger-Aliassime</i>
<i>is going to be coached by Toni Nadal.</i>

41:39.440 --> 41:42.400
<i>It's the Uncle Toni Derby.</i>

41:44.480 --> 41:45.960
Who's he cheering for?
