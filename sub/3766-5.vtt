Thought you might need this.

00:12.025 --> 00:13.895
Ah!

00:13.928 --> 00:17.001
-I take it business is good?
-This is my first break today.

00:17.035 --> 00:19.540
Okay, you need to hire
a receptionist

00:19.573 --> 00:22.011
or a nurse or a barista.

00:22.045 --> 00:25.152
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you for the coffee.

00:25.185 --> 00:26.787
It's very thoughtful.

00:26.821 --> 00:29.193
I had a really good time
at the dance the other night,

00:29.227 --> 00:30.495
thanks to you.

00:30.529 --> 00:33.668
Hmm.
It was not a dull evening,
that's for sure.

00:35.172 --> 00:37.709
Would you like to have another
not-so-dull evening?

00:41.884 --> 00:43.955
This is where
you'd say something.

00:43.988 --> 00:45.492
(EXHALES)

00:45.525 --> 00:46.527
Dinner.

00:47.829 --> 00:50.101
Okay? Friday night?

00:51.604 --> 00:53.141
I'd love to.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.094
Oh, great.

01:03.127 --> 01:06.267
Amber begs me
to be partners with her
on our history project.

01:06.301 --> 01:07.936
We're supposed
to work on it tonight

01:07.969 --> 01:10.074
and she just bailed on me.

01:10.108 --> 01:11.311
(CHUCKLES)

01:12.078 --> 01:13.448
Bribe her with some dessert.

01:13.481 --> 01:15.685
Mom, girls like
Amber don't eat.

01:15.719 --> 01:17.889
That's one of the reasons
they're so mean.

01:17.923 --> 01:20.795
-They're really hungry.
-(CHUCKLES)

01:20.829 --> 01:23.568
Being mean is just
a defense mechanism.

01:23.601 --> 01:25.372
Pushing someone away
before they have a chance

01:25.405 --> 01:26.807
to push you away,

01:26.841 --> 01:29.947
when what she really
wants to do is be your friend.

01:29.980 --> 01:33.154
Mom, you just don't get it.

01:33.187 --> 01:35.759
It's been a long time
since you were in high school.

01:35.792 --> 01:37.896
True, true.

01:37.929 --> 01:40.669
But with age comes wisdom.

01:49.219 --> 01:50.455
For you.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.229
A compass?

01:54.263 --> 01:57.669
-That was Dad's.
-From when he was a Scout.

01:57.703 --> 02:00.475
I just happened to find it
in some boxes
at the store today.

02:01.075 --> 02:03.046
Or maybe it found me.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.883
I have a feeling it's for you.

02:07.021 --> 02:08.023
(SCOFFS)

02:08.958 --> 02:12.866
Daddy was, like,
eight when he had this,

02:12.899 --> 02:15.037
and I'm practically 16.

02:15.639 --> 02:17.275
And I'm a girl.

02:18.177 --> 02:20.349
You know, (SIGHS)
your father always said

02:20.382 --> 02:22.886
he never felt lost
when he had this compass.

02:22.919 --> 02:25.291
But I'm not lost.

What's with the suitcase?

03:15.057 --> 03:17.796
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were
somebody else for a minute.

03:18.431 --> 03:19.933
No, I'm just me.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.471
Abigail.

03:41.977 --> 03:43.347
Abigail?

03:45.183 --> 03:47.689
Were you expecting her?
Because she didn't say...

03:47.723 --> 03:49.326
Uh, she's not a guest, Sam.

I can certainly see
the family resemblance.

-Most of the time.

Hi. Abigail, I've heard
so much about you.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.396
I'm glad to finally meet you,

04:41.430 --> 04:43.199
I don't really remember you
from before.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.336
Well, you were very young

something about his sick kid.

04:50.849 --> 04:52.452
He tried your cell, but...

04:54.589 --> 04:57.562
It goes straight to voicemail.

PS: I'm not your receptionist.

05:01.303 --> 05:03.775
Well, I should go
give Paul a call.

05:03.808 --> 05:05.344
Nice to meet you.

I'll see you around, Sam.

05:19.271 --> 05:20.508
I haven't heard
from you in a while.

05:20.541 --> 05:21.711
I was getting worried.

05:21.744 --> 05:23.748
I tried to call last month.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.819
My cell was stolen.

05:25.852 --> 05:28.991
I have a new number.
I'll give it to you.

05:29.025 --> 05:31.563
-I've just been
so busy with work.
-Oh.

-You didn't need to.

05:37.307 --> 05:38.677
Right.

05:38.711 --> 05:40.681
You had a feeling.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.088
I did and I do, all the time.

05:44.121 --> 05:47.662
Well, I had so much vacation
time they insisted I use some.

-Did they?
-They did.

you looked at Abigail.

We have a history.

06:26.807 --> 06:28.009
I can tell.

06:29.045 --> 06:30.247
Sister to sister,

06:31.550 --> 06:34.221
it's really easy to get

06:34.255 --> 06:37.361
sucked in by
all her Abigail-ness.

06:37.394 --> 06:40.634
And then it's easy
to get hurt,

Chris Hemsworth movie, but...

what you were doing

-She's practically 18.
-She's 15.

but the answer is no.

-Don't be in such
a hurry to grow up.

whether you like it or not,

doesn't change everything.

about this stuff than I do.

13:07.173 --> 13:08.475
Here.

13:12.651 --> 13:14.087
I'm kind of glad you did.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.236
(DOOR OPENS)

13:25.609 --> 13:27.513
Don't worry, he'll show.

13:27.546 --> 13:30.386
-You think?
-Honey, look in the mirror.

13:30.419 --> 13:33.392
-(CHUCKLING)
-Thank you.

13:33.425 --> 13:35.329
What is that lovely fragrance
you're wearing?

13:35.362 --> 13:37.533
-Oh, you like it?
-I do.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.635
(CHUCKLES)

13:39.771 --> 13:41.341
May I?

13:41.374 --> 13:44.280
Sure. We girls have
to stick together, right?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.051
We do.

13:50.526 --> 13:51.594
I love patchouli.

13:54.936 --> 13:55.938
Excuse me.

14:00.246 --> 14:01.348
Sam.

14:02.150 --> 14:03.685
-Hey!
-Hi!

14:03.719 --> 14:04.821
Sam!

14:06.825 --> 14:08.395
Sam?

14:08.428 --> 14:10.199
I thought you were going
to stand me up.

14:10.232 --> 14:11.668
-Um...
-You were right.

14:11.970 --> 14:13.138
Was I?

14:14.274 --> 14:16.244
Stephanie,
this is Cassie's cousin.

14:16.278 --> 14:17.747
-Abigail.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:17.781 --> 14:19.517
She's helping me out
at the office.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.021
I'll bet she is.

14:23.092 --> 14:24.627
I'll give you a minute
to decide.

14:26.598 --> 14:27.834
Your order.

14:39.524 --> 14:41.661
-I got us a table.
-Great.

14:44.334 --> 14:46.571
(SNIFFS) Wow. Is that you?

14:46.604 --> 14:48.208
Yes. You like it?

14:48.242 --> 14:50.712
Yeah, and normally
I'm allergic to perfume.

14:50.746 --> 14:51.748
Oh.

14:52.716 --> 14:54.354
SAM: Sorry I'm late.

14:54.387 --> 14:55.722
House call.

14:55.756 --> 14:58.362
Oh. So, there are still
doctors that make house calls?

14:58.395 --> 15:01.334
I never thought
I'd be one of them, but yes.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.140
-It's very dedicated of you.
-Well...

15:04.174 --> 15:06.344
You seem dressed up.

15:06.378 --> 15:07.680
You sound so surprised.

15:07.713 --> 15:10.119
No, it's just that
when you asked me
to come out and talk,

15:10.152 --> 15:11.488
you seemed...

15:12.958 --> 15:15.196
When I'm depressed,
I like to dress up.

15:15.229 --> 15:16.331
So you're depressed?

15:17.968 --> 15:20.339
I'm all kinds of things
at the moment.

15:20.372 --> 15:22.243
That's why I needed
to talk to someone.

15:22.911 --> 15:24.214
What about Cassie?

15:24.247 --> 15:27.186
Uh, we don't see eye to eye
on certain things,

15:27.220 --> 15:29.390
but Cassie is one of the best
listeners I've ever met.

15:29.424 --> 15:30.792
ABIGAIL: That's the problem.

15:30.826 --> 15:34.300
Cassie's kind of
perfect at everything.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.836
It can be
intimidating sometimes.

15:36.171 --> 15:37.440
(SCOFFS)

15:38.075 --> 15:39.577
I knew you'd understand.

15:44.854 --> 15:47.193
This developer
was looking at Blairsville.

15:47.226 --> 15:50.032
The mayor was more than happy
to share that news with me.

15:50.066 --> 15:52.303
He wants to make
an offer, here.

15:53.072 --> 15:55.176
-The Keating House?
-Yeah.

15:55.209 --> 15:56.478
He wants to tear it down

15:56.511 --> 15:59.684
and he's gonna put up
six very high-end townhouses.

15:59.717 --> 16:01.421
-Well, that means jobs.
-Yeah.

16:01.454 --> 16:02.656
And a new tax base.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.996
And development, especially
high-end development shows

16:05.029 --> 16:06.664
a town on the rise.

16:06.698 --> 16:08.868
Plus, I get to
stick it to Blairsville.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.674
Looks like it's a win-win
situation all around.

16:13.312 --> 16:14.580
(INHALES)

16:15.749 --> 16:17.486
But...

16:17.520 --> 16:20.626
But, the buyer
doesn't want any roadblocks.

16:20.659 --> 16:21.928
And the land
on the Keating House

16:21.961 --> 16:24.367
is currently zoned
single-family residential.

16:26.071 --> 16:27.740
But if it weren't?

16:29.010 --> 16:31.014
I think we might have
something to celebrate.

16:32.516 --> 16:34.154
It's a very big deal, Martha.

16:35.222 --> 16:36.658
I think, as mayor,

16:36.691 --> 16:38.595
it's time for me
to re-evaluate

16:38.628 --> 16:40.799
some of the zoning areas
around town.

16:42.770 --> 16:46.044
Not everyone in town
might feel the way you feel.

16:46.078 --> 16:47.146
Oh, pfft!

16:47.180 --> 16:49.417
I'm leading Middleton
to a new revenue source

16:49.450 --> 16:50.952
and a bigger, brighter future.

16:50.986 --> 16:53.292
(CHUCKLES)
Who won't like that?

17:04.614 --> 17:05.816
Hey, there.

17:06.584 --> 17:08.355
Hey!

17:08.388 --> 17:11.894
So I will admit
to being completely
in the dark,

17:11.928 --> 17:13.064
but is something wrong
with our kids?

17:13.598 --> 17:15.269
(SIGHS)

17:15.302 --> 17:16.904
Seems to be more than
the normal amount

17:16.938 --> 17:19.377
of animosity between them.

17:19.410 --> 17:21.848
I never know
what's happening with Nick
until the principal calls.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.495
-You okay?
-Yeah. Growing pains.

17:28.528 --> 17:29.864
Oh. Grace?

17:29.897 --> 17:31.734
Yeah, for both of us, I think.

17:33.272 --> 17:35.976
Well, if it's any consolation,
I don't think Grace's
growing pains

17:36.009 --> 17:38.915
mean that you'll be
hearing from the principal
any time soon.

17:40.319 --> 17:41.854
Teenagers.

17:41.888 --> 17:45.027
Yeah. I knew
this day was coming,
but now that it's here...

17:46.564 --> 17:48.000
You know, when I got out
of Med School,

17:48.033 --> 17:49.670
I had to take my boards,

17:49.704 --> 17:52.510
an eight-hour test
with over 300 questions,

17:52.543 --> 17:53.745
and the score on this test

17:53.778 --> 17:56.584
determines which residency
program you're matched with.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.890
I never thought anything
could be that difficult.

17:59.924 --> 18:02.028
-And then Nick turned 13.
-(CHUCKLES)

18:04.367 --> 18:06.036
Grace is a good kid.

18:06.069 --> 18:07.773
Yeah. So is Nick.

18:07.806 --> 18:09.710
Well, he has his moments.

18:09.744 --> 18:11.448
God willing, I can string
enough of them together

18:11.481 --> 18:13.985
to get him out of high school
and into a college.

18:15.155 --> 18:16.224
Hey, thanks.

18:16.858 --> 18:18.093
Anytime.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.173
Hey, uh, Abigail is great,
by the way.

18:24.206 --> 18:26.644
Yeah. She's working for you
at your office.

18:26.678 --> 18:27.946
She said it was your idea.

18:29.082 --> 18:30.852
Abigail can be a handful.

18:31.688 --> 18:33.525
I can handle her.

18:33.558 --> 18:35.629
Just make sure
she's not handling you.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.757
-Will that be all, sir?
-(SCOFFS)

18:49.790 --> 18:52.963
"Sir?" Is this about
last night?

18:52.996 --> 18:55.636
-You mean your date?
-It wasn't a date.

18:55.669 --> 18:58.040
She needed
somebody to talk to.

18:58.073 --> 19:00.512
Oh, please.
That is the oldest trick
in the book.

19:03.485 --> 19:04.687
So I've heard.

19:07.024 --> 19:08.428
Are we still on for tonight?

19:12.403 --> 19:13.538
Yeah.

19:14.206 --> 19:15.842
That new French place?

19:15.876 --> 19:17.946
Sure. I could pick you up.

19:17.980 --> 19:19.950
I have to cover here
till 7:00, so...

19:21.354 --> 19:22.590
I'll meet you there.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.197
(CHUCKLES)

19:27.966 --> 19:29.269
(GIGGLES)

19:30.506 --> 19:33.211
Grace! Um, are you in there?

19:33.244 --> 19:34.447
Don't you like it?

19:36.183 --> 19:38.020
Uh... Where did you get it?

19:39.122 --> 19:40.726
-Guilty.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

19:41.794 --> 19:43.632
Uh... (SIGHS)

19:43.665 --> 19:45.469
Well, you can't wear
it to school.

19:45.502 --> 19:47.004
This is what the kids
are wearing today.

19:47.038 --> 19:50.812
-Yeah.
-Yeah, not my kid. Grace!

19:50.846 --> 19:52.916
(SCOFFS)
You're being totally unfair.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.824
You can't keep me
a little girl forever.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.476
(SIGHS)

20:08.281 --> 20:09.684
It's just an outfit.

20:11.019 --> 20:12.990
Her job is to push the limits

20:13.023 --> 20:15.261
and my job is to enforce them.

20:15.295 --> 20:16.898
But if you become
just an enforcer,

20:16.931 --> 20:19.102
she's just gonna keep
pulling away.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.407
My advice,
loosen your grip a little bit.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.112
-I can't.
-No, you just don't want to.

20:24.145 --> 20:26.718
No, I can't.

20:26.751 --> 20:29.456
Because I'm the only one left
with a grip on her.

20:32.329 --> 20:33.532
I'm sorry.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.374
I just know how upset Grace
has been since Jake died.

20:39.544 --> 20:40.546
You do?

20:41.179 --> 20:42.783
We all have our gifts.

20:44.687 --> 20:45.822
We do.

20:47.359 --> 20:50.197
I feel very connected to Grace
in a way that maybe you...

20:50.230 --> 20:53.738
-Abigail, I know
you mean well...
-I do.

20:53.772 --> 20:55.441
I'm so glad you can see
I'm just trying to help.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.115
You're the best.

21:12.275 --> 21:13.678
Hi, all.

21:13.712 --> 21:15.515
-Hey.
-Hi!

21:15.548 --> 21:16.684
I brought muffins.

21:16.718 --> 21:19.122
-Cranberry, my favorite!
-(STEPHANIE GIGGLES)

21:19.155 --> 21:20.659
I'm allergic to cranberries.

21:22.663 --> 21:24.834
Uh, thanks. Excuse me.

21:27.071 --> 21:28.942
I brought the muffins for Sam.

21:28.975 --> 21:30.578
Oh, it's clear
that you're here for Sam.

21:31.948 --> 21:33.718
Aren't you the waitress?

21:33.752 --> 21:36.089
And I see you're
the new receptionist.

21:36.122 --> 21:37.258
Office manager.

21:37.291 --> 21:41.266
-I own the Bistro.
-Lucky you're single, then.

21:41.299 --> 21:44.172
Running a small business
by yourself must take up
all your time.

21:44.205 --> 21:45.308
Not all of it.

21:46.610 --> 21:50.318
So, you'll be leaving soon,
going back to New York?

21:51.553 --> 21:53.324
My plans might change.

21:53.357 --> 21:55.361
Well, what on earth
could Middleton have

21:55.395 --> 21:58.100
to lure you away
from the big city?

21:58.133 --> 22:00.237
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Family, of course.

22:01.540 --> 22:02.743
Of course.

22:04.112 --> 22:06.818
So, we still on for tonight?

22:06.851 --> 22:08.587
We have a date.

22:09.255 --> 22:10.625
Looking forward to it.

22:13.364 --> 22:15.368
It was a pleasure
talking to you.

22:15.401 --> 22:16.670
Oh, you, too.

22:28.126 --> 22:31.633
So, I heard you're selling
Keating house to a developer.

22:32.569 --> 22:34.305
Martha.

22:34.338 --> 22:37.111
In her defense, I think
she just wanted to get me
on board with the sale,

22:37.144 --> 22:38.414
since she knew
it would be unpopular

22:38.447 --> 22:39.616
with the town council.

22:41.352 --> 22:44.426
So, do you really think that
tearing down Keating house

22:44.459 --> 22:45.796
is the best option
for our town?

22:45.829 --> 22:47.833
-I don't have the choice.
-Sure you do.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.669
No, I don't.
Not when you're in sales.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.206
That's not true.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.411
You're in retail,
I am in real estate.

22:53.444 --> 22:56.049
If you don't like something,
you just don't carry it.

22:56.082 --> 22:57.218
I don't have that luxury.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.423
But you still have a choice.

22:59.456 --> 23:00.959
Look, this is pretty simple.

23:00.992 --> 23:03.464
Someone makes an offer,
I have to accept that offer

23:03.497 --> 23:06.202
for my client if that's
what my client wants.

23:06.236 --> 23:08.273
The choice is theirs,
it's not mine.

23:09.676 --> 23:12.048
This is not about
what I want, Cassie.

23:13.617 --> 23:15.922
This is not personal, Cassie.

23:15.956 --> 23:17.324
This is business.

23:17.358 --> 23:20.230
But in Middleton,
all business is personal.

23:24.673 --> 23:25.876
GRACE: Anthony!

23:27.846 --> 23:28.848
Hi.

23:29.884 --> 23:32.254
Does this mean
you're talking to me again?

23:32.288 --> 23:33.858
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

23:35.194 --> 23:38.902
You know I'm sorry
about the dance and Nick.

23:40.370 --> 23:41.974
Why did you do that?

23:43.310 --> 23:45.114
I don't know, I mean...

23:45.147 --> 23:47.685
He's always bugging me,
so I thought I'd bug him.

23:47.719 --> 23:48.787
(CHUCKLES)

23:49.723 --> 23:51.894
Basically, I was a jerk,

23:51.928 --> 23:53.697
and if there's anything
I can do to make it up to you,

23:53.731 --> 23:54.900
name it.

23:56.537 --> 23:57.940
Anything?

23:57.973 --> 24:00.244
Well, I'm not prepared
to commit murder,

24:00.277 --> 24:02.081
but other than that, name it.

24:02.815 --> 24:04.453
Amber is no help.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.391
-You need help with
your history project?
-Please.

24:07.424 --> 24:09.763
-Done.
-You're the best.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.533
I'm glad you're back
to thinking so.

24:23.056 --> 24:24.125
Hi.

24:25.127 --> 24:26.129
Hi.

24:26.597 --> 24:27.665
Working?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.202
Yeah.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.108
Uh, on an article
about a local dairy farmer

24:32.141 --> 24:33.744
who is converting
part of his field

24:33.777 --> 24:35.615
into wind turbines.

24:35.648 --> 24:39.388
You left a big-city newspaper
to write articles about cows.

24:39.422 --> 24:43.130
Well, my career is important,
but so is my family.

24:43.163 --> 24:44.633
I wanted more of a balance.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.104
Interesting.

24:49.042 --> 24:50.845
What about you?

Well, I was
in advertising, but...

24:52.515 --> 24:54.553
You were in advertising?

24:54.586 --> 24:56.690
I thought you were just
on a break from your job.

I am, but I'm thinking about
making it more permanent,

25:00.998 --> 25:02.635

that Sam needs me.

you came to hang out with.

follow you anymore.

and not delivering.

is too long to go into,

Grace to have a list
like mine someday.

something even better

-Hey, Sam.

26:53.691 --> 26:55.460
I just wanted to ask
you a question.

26:55.494 --> 26:57.264
-Sure.
-Abigail.

She's completely
organized my office.

26:59.936 --> 27:01.138
Okay.

27:01.171 --> 27:03.075
Maybe you could talk to her
about letting me pay her.

27:03.109 --> 27:05.314
She doesn't seem to
want anything from me,

27:05.347 --> 27:06.650

right about that.

can take care of herself.

27:09.555 --> 27:13.062
Well, she puts on this
incredibly confident front,

27:13.095 --> 27:15.534
but underneath, I think
she's a little insecure.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.905
Abigail is brilliant

27:17.939 --> 27:19.976
at figuring out
what people want,

27:20.009 --> 27:21.680
but not necessarily
what they need.

27:23.450 --> 27:25.855
She thinks
you don't approve of her.

27:25.888 --> 27:28.493

I don't approve of her,

you don't measure up to
your family's expectations.

27:35.139 --> 27:36.476
Really?

27:36.509 --> 27:38.145
Well, my father was tough.

27:38.179 --> 27:39.949
If I got an A,
it was expected.

27:39.983 --> 27:41.953
-It was not congratulated.
-Hmm.

27:41.987 --> 27:44.693
And if I got anything less
than an A, well,

27:44.726 --> 27:46.328
he'd let me know
it was unacceptable.

27:48.065 --> 27:52.173
Well, if Abigail
has a problem with me,
she should come to me.

27:52.207 --> 27:54.478
You have to know that
you're a little intimidating.

27:55.146 --> 27:56.181

27:56.215 --> 27:58.553
I think maybe she was
just more comfortable

-I'm not perfect.

anything by it.

-But I don't want
to interrupt.

37:00.235 --> 37:02.372
No. We're all friends, right?

37:02.406 --> 37:04.310
Yeah, yeah, we're all friends.
(CHUCKLES)

37:05.077 --> 37:06.113
Hmm.

37:09.887 --> 37:11.525
CASSIE: Oh, thanks! Mmm.

37:13.227 --> 37:14.764
So, Sam, what's new?

37:16.099 --> 37:19.072
Well, we're gonna need
a bigger cake.

37:19.105 --> 37:20.242
(CHUCKLES)

37:23.147 --> 37:24.784
-Yeah.
-Oh, sure.

37:24.817 --> 37:26.420
-Yeah. Thanks.
-Mmm.

37:28.925 --> 37:31.430
Hi. Uh, coffee
with cream, please.

37:38.077 --> 37:39.079
Hey.

37:40.047 --> 37:42.787
Pie and ice cream on me,
compliments of Cassie.

37:44.089 --> 37:46.595
-Where's Grace?
-Um, she's, uh...

37:48.197 --> 37:49.767
-Anthony?
-Yeah?

37:49.801 --> 37:50.903
Where is she?

37:51.771 --> 37:52.940
Honestly, I don't know.

37:53.909 --> 37:55.478
What do you mean,
you don't know?

38:06.635 --> 38:08.003
GRACE ON VOICEMAIL:
Hey, it's Grace.

38:08.037 --> 38:09.907
Leave a message
and I'll get
right back to you.

38:09.941 --> 38:11.143
(SIGHS)

38:16.721 --> 38:18.659
Well, thanks for letting me
crash your...

38:19.393 --> 38:20.896
-Dinner.
-(CHUCKLES)

38:20.929 --> 38:23.033
I'd invite you back
to my place,

38:23.067 --> 38:24.937
but I don't want you two
to get the wrong idea.

38:26.206 --> 38:28.043
Good night, Sam.

38:28.077 --> 38:30.081
-Good night, Sam.
-See ya.

39:14.069 --> 39:15.839
Uh-huh?

39:15.873 --> 39:17.642
-What are you doing here?
-(CHUCKLES)

39:17.676 --> 39:19.713
You should go home.
This isn't your crowd.

39:19.747 --> 39:22.318
Hey, I'm not going anywhere

39:23.454 --> 39:25.024
and I can take care of myself.

39:28.163 --> 39:29.265
Ah.

39:29.299 --> 39:31.670
Yeah, you really didn't have
to walk me inside.

39:31.704 --> 39:32.940
Can't be too safe, right?

39:36.179 --> 39:39.620
Well, Sam was certainly
an interesting twist
to the evening.

39:39.653 --> 39:41.624
It was nice of you
to let him join us.

39:41.657 --> 39:44.496
He's upset.
He really messed it up
with Stephanie.

39:44.530 --> 39:46.333
What about me?

39:46.366 --> 39:48.704
Have I totally
messed it up with you?

39:48.738 --> 39:50.575
You know, I'm just surprised

39:50.608 --> 39:52.947
the deal means as much
to you as it does.

39:52.980 --> 39:55.084
I thought we were pretty much
on the same page with,

39:55.117 --> 39:56.787
well, a lot of things.

39:57.422 --> 39:58.758
I was talking about us.

40:01.898 --> 40:04.703
Should I be hoping
for a good night kiss?

40:04.736 --> 40:07.910
-It was dinner,
not a date, remember.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:07.943 --> 40:10.114
Do you kiss everyone you have
dinner with good night?

40:10.147 --> 40:12.151
-As a matter of fact, I do.
-Oh.

40:12.185 --> 40:14.122
-Mmm-hmm.
-Well, in that case.

40:17.829 --> 40:20.101
Now that I know your moves,
I'll be ready for next time.

40:20.134 --> 40:22.138
Oh, you assume
there is a next time?

40:22.171 --> 40:24.042
Hey, it was
just dinner, right?

40:25.211 --> 40:27.081
-Night.
-Good night.

40:27.115 --> 40:28.283
(CHUCKLES)

40:41.744 --> 40:42.913
Grace?

40:51.497 --> 40:53.433
She's not with Anthony.
I called her cell,

40:53.468 --> 40:54.670
but it went straight
to voicemail.

40:54.703 --> 40:56.540
-I don't know where she is.
