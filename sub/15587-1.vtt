Jesus, you couldn't have
found a less friendly place?

38:21.925 --> 38:23.711
I come here to get away from the guys,

38:23.885 --> 38:26.047

is just a bonus.

38:27.597 --> 38:31.591
Whoowee. Thank you so much.
You look wonderful today.

38:31.726 --> 38:32.841
Funny.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.024
- Jake.
- Hmm?

38:46.115 --> 38:48.106
I remembered something last night.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.370
During the alleycat there was...

38:54.999 --> 38:57.741
a guy. A biker.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.207
And, it was like...

39:02.340 --> 39:05.128
It was like he was after Chris
or something.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.467
- A biker?
- I'm serious.

39:07.679 --> 39:11.172
Chris saw him and... and freaked,
obviously.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.139
I mean he... he rode straight past me.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.848
But, I...
I didn't remember until last night.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.517
You were fucked last night.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.353
Come on. I know what I saw.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.273
Jake, I think
this biker took the camera.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.276
- Chris's camera?
- Yeah.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.989
OK, but what did the police say?

39:37.125 --> 39:40.163
What do you think they fucking said?
I was off my tits, wasn't I?

39:40.295 --> 39:41.660

They didn't believe a word.
Fucking Sid, man.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.849
(SIGHS) Yeah.
I had a word with him last night.

40:08.531 --> 40:12.866
I mean, the police must have
said something though.

40:17.206 --> 40:21.291
It's just a hit-and-run.
Another stupid courier.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.087

40:34.807 --> 40:36.718

I'll find him myself.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.020
Will you sit down, please?

40:43.024 --> 40:45.186
I'm sorry. OK? I'm sorry.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.861

Maybe he filmed something.

it was really early.

Your brother and another courier turned
up at Yates's office with a package.

46:32.081 --> 46:33.321
It can't be a coincidence

46:33.457 --> 46:35.664
because whatever
was inside it freaked him out, big time.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.706
That's Ronnie, he runs the courier
company. Do you recognize him?

46:38.838 --> 46:41.421
No, it was dark.
