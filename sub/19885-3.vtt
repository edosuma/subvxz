WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:03.367
(lively music)

00:37.438 --> 00:38.905
- Anne!

00:57.124 --> 00:58.924
- Oh!

00:58.959 --> 01:02.394
I expect it's perfectly normal
to be slightly nervous

01:02.429 --> 01:05.030
on your first day, but I'm sure
everything will be fine.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.266
I don't have much experience
with school,

01:07.301 --> 01:10.135
but why wouldn't it be fine?
Better than fine.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.704
I have no doubt
that it will be.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.706
None at all.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.375
I'm a few years behind,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.378
but that's no reason
not to be optimistic.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.780
The only place
I can go from here,

01:21.815 --> 01:23.916
academically speaking, is up.

01:23.951 --> 01:26.952
If a person puts their best foot
forward, things can go well.

01:26.987 --> 01:30.189
- Slow those feet down, please.

01:31.125 --> 01:34.026
- It will be nice to have
a lot of new friends,

01:34.061 --> 01:36.996
although I expect it will be
difficult to find a toehold,

01:37.031 --> 01:38.831
since they've probably
all known each other forever.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.466
Going to school is
my lifelong dream.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.769
What could possibly go wr--

01:45.039 --> 01:47.339
Please let that
not be portentous.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.942
- For heaven's sake, Anne,
I told you to slow down.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.945
- I'll fetch the broom.
- I'm sorry, Marilla.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.514
- You'll do just fine today.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.517
You're smart as the dickens.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.185
- I'm not so worried
about my brain.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.588
I believe it to be
in fairly good working order.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.356
- Hmm.
- And with any luck,

02:04.391 --> 02:06.692
I'll catch up with the rest
of the class quite quickly.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.927
That's not really my concern.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.596
Do you want to know
what my big concern is?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.098
My overriding concern?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.134
- I'm sure you'll tell us
soon enough.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.239
- It's this awful red hair!

02:20.274 --> 02:22.942
This horrible, hideous,
horrible red hair.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.444
It's the bane of my existence.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.812
- Anne Shirley-Cuthbert,

02:26.847 --> 02:30.449
I suggest you find
a worthier overriding concern.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.819
- And my freckles.
I hate my freckles.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.321
And I can't help but think

02:35.356 --> 02:37.790
that the other children would
like me better if I was pretty.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.658
- Fiddlesticks.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.061
You're a vain one
and no mistake.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.562
- If a rose wasn't beautiful,

02:43.597 --> 02:45.998
nobody would want to stop
and smell it.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.068
And besides,
how can I be vain if I'm ugly?

02:49.103 --> 02:50.903
- Enough of this foolishness.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.672
You'll do just fine at school

02:53.707 --> 02:56.542
if you'd stop your yammering
and fortify yourself.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.481
(music)

03:13.527 --> 03:15.528

04:11.218 --> 04:13.218
- Why, hello there.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.654
I'm ever so pleased
to make your acquaintances.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.389
Greetings. No.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.258
Salutations!

04:20.761 --> 04:24.797
Oh, your dress is splendid!
Puff sleeves are divine!

04:27.968 --> 04:30.069
Have you always lived
in Avonlea?

04:30.104 --> 04:33.272
Oh, I agree. I believe it to be
the most beautiful place

04:33.307 --> 04:36.742
on earth,
and I've travelled a fair deal.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.845
It gives one
a worldly perspective.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.814
Oh, this old thing?

04:41.849 --> 04:44.283
I adore wildflowers, don't you?

04:44.318 --> 04:46.752
Sometimes I like to imagine
that my room

04:46.787 --> 04:48.787
is a flowery bower.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.290
Did you know that a bower
is a lady's private apartment

04:51.325 --> 04:54.126
in a medieval hall or castle?

04:54.161 --> 04:57.263
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to be a princess?

04:58.665 --> 05:01.133
Words cannot express
how thrilling it is

05:01.168 --> 05:02.601
to make your acquaintance.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.141
(music)

05:24.191 --> 05:26.158
(loud background chatter)

05:36.336 --> 05:37.669
- Anne!

05:37.704 --> 05:40.005
- Hello, Diana!

05:42.509 --> 05:45.144
- My, what have you done
to your hat?

05:45.179 --> 05:47.513
- Well, I wanted to make
a good first impression

05:47.548 --> 05:49.014
and it was so plain.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.116
- You're making an impression
all right.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.285
(laughing)
I'm glad you found your way.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.587
I expect we should be able
to walk together soon.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.989
- We can't?

05:57.024 --> 05:59.191
- I'm sure it won't be long
until my parents accept you,

05:59.226 --> 06:00.626
now that you're a Cuthbert
and all.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.295
Welcome to the first day
of school.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.964
Come on, I'll show you
everything you need to know.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.000
(indistinct chatter)

06:09.102 --> 06:11.470
Leave your hat
and sweater here.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.306
You can sit with me.
Ruby won't mind.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.308
I think Jane and Ruby
may sit together

06:16.343 --> 06:17.643
now that Prissy's studying

06:17.678 --> 06:19.478
for her Queen's Academy
entrance exams

06:19.513 --> 06:22.014
and needs to sit
with the older students.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.649
- Who?
(Diana giggling)

06:23.684 --> 06:26.185
- Go on
and set your things down.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.720
- Hello there. I'm Moody.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.290
- I'm sorry.
- Moody Spurgeon.

06:31.325 --> 06:33.458
- Oh. I'm Anne.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.626
- I'm Charlie.

06:34.661 --> 06:37.696
- Charlie Sloane.
- Happy to meet you.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.099
- Don't talk to the boys.
They're ridiculous.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.302
- Nice to see you, too, Diana.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.705
- All except Gilbert Blythe.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.742
He's dreamy,
but he won't be here today.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.315
This is Jane Andrews
and Josie Pye and Ruby Gillis

06:56.350 --> 06:57.382
and Tillie Boulter.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.284
Everybody, this is Anne.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.352
- Hello, Anne.
- Hello.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.187
- Nice to meet you.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.857
- It is a scrumptious pleasure
to make your acquaintances.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.625
And I shall do my utmost

07:06.660 --> 07:08.761
to prove myself worthy
of your friendship.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.031
- Uh, Anne loves to read.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.000
And she knows
ever so many big words.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.070
- Does she use them all
in every sentence?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.874
- I like to read, too.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.876
- No, you don't.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.178
- No, I don't.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.913
- I saw you
at the church picnic.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.115
I'm sorry,
I should've said hello.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.217
- There were an awful lot
of people there.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.552
- Mother wouldn't let me.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.555
- Why do they make you wear
that old-lady dress?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.791
- It's just nice
to have something new.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.261
- If you're an orphan,
I suppose.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.029
I wouldn't be caught dead in it.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.033
- Anne isn't an orphan anymore.
She's been adopted.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.402
- I'm still an orphan, Diana.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.771
I'll always be an orphan.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.607
- Goodness,
I'd hate to be an orphan.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.509
- I feel real sorry for you,
Anne.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.012
(boy barking)

08:00.047 --> 08:02.714
- You're ridiculous.

08:02.749 --> 08:05.550
- Hey, look, it's a talking dog!

08:05.585 --> 08:07.085
Can you fetch, too?

08:07.120 --> 08:10.255
- Billy, leave her be.
(Billy): Sit. Stay.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.090
Roll over.
(chuckling)

08:12.125 --> 08:14.893
- Don't mind my brother.
He's ridiculous!

08:14.928 --> 08:16.595
- Ruff.

08:16.630 --> 08:20.365
- Never let the boys know
when they've upset you.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.201
- Never let them know
when you like them, either.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.770
- School...

08:24.805 --> 08:27.406
is a lot to contend with.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.608
- Have you ever been
to a real school,

08:29.643 --> 08:32.811
or did they just send you
to special orphan school?

08:34.481 --> 08:36.949
- Come on, Anne,
let's finish the tour.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.652
Bring your milk. I'll show you
the stream outside.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.933
(knocking)

08:58.038 --> 09:00.605
- Good morning, Miss Cuthbert.
- Good morning.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.774
- I don't think we've ever been
formally introduced,

09:02.809 --> 09:04.977
but of course I know you
from town and church.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.112
- It's Mrs. Bell, isn't it?

09:07.147 --> 09:08.981
- Yes. And this is Mrs. Andrews.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.716
- Nice to know you.
- How do you do?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.818
How may I help you?

09:12.853 --> 09:15.153
- We're here on behalf
of the PMSC.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.822
- The Progressive Mothers'
Sewing Circle.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.824
You might have heard of us.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.426
We've been meeting twice a month
for over two years.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.328
- Of course.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.397
I'd be happy
to make a small donation.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.465
- Oh, no.
(laughing)

09:26.500 --> 09:29.001
Thank you kindly,
but we're not a charity.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.203
We're an organization.
- An informal organization.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.705
- But an organization
nonetheless.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.340
Mothers who gather
to discuss the education

09:35.375 --> 09:36.742
of our young girls.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.077
- We also do needlepoint.
- And tea is served, of course.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.680
- That sounds stimulating.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.116
- Now that you're mother
to a young girl,

09:44.151 --> 09:46.385
we're wondering if you'd like
to attend our meetings.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.220
- Oh.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.890
- We should warn you that our
viewpoints are forward-thinking.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.227
- We believe that a woman's
education is just as important

09:55.262 --> 09:56.661
as a man's.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.930
- That is admirable.

09:58.965 --> 10:02.300
- Now that your... ward, your...

10:02.335 --> 10:03.502
- Anne.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.538
- Since your Anne is part
of our community now

10:06.573 --> 10:08.240
and you'll be raising her,

10:08.275 --> 10:11.410
we wanted to extend the
invitation for you to join us.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.246
- We're meeting at the Andrews'
home this afternoon.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.948
- Will you come?

10:16.550 --> 10:19.651
- Set your milk down next to
mine, Anne, so it'll stay cold.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.553
- I must've done
something wrong just then,

10:21.588 --> 10:23.955
but I don't know what it was.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.525
- Let me tell you all the things
you'll need to know about lunch.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.093
All the girls in our clique
sit together.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.095
We make a kind of clubhouse
with no boys allowed.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.297
I usually sit next to Jane,

10:32.332 --> 10:34.099
but sometimes Jane sits
with her big sister, Prissy.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.234
Tillie sits on the other side
of Josie.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.103
You'll need to gauge the
situation accordingly

10:38.138 --> 10:39.971
since we always sit
the same way.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.874
Everybody shows what they brought for
lunch and then we divide it equally.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.377
(voice fading): Anyone who doesn't
share is considered awful mean.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.979
(knocking)
(boy): Hey, Anne, over here.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.514
Over here. Ruff!

10:49.549 --> 10:51.149
Who's a good girl?
(knocking)

10:51.184 --> 10:52.584
(indistinct chatter)

10:52.619 --> 10:54.386
(barking)

10:55.222 --> 10:56.288
- What'd you bring, Anne?

10:56.323 --> 10:58.023
- Josie Pye doesn't like me
at all.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.424
- I brought a lace-trimmed
handkerchief

10:59.459 --> 11:00.625
in honour of the occasion.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.927
It should make
a lovely presentation.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.296
Hopefully your apple's
already sliced for sharing.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.797
- Apple? I... I--

11:05.832 --> 11:07.800
- Come on,
I'll show you the rest.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.502
(bell ringing)

11:12.772 --> 11:14.573
Avonlea schooling
is very progressive.

11:14.608 --> 11:17.576
We have a second room
for the youngsters.

11:19.813 --> 11:20.979
- Hello.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.348
All right, uh, take your seats.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.986
- Diana, what kind of sums
are those?

11:28.021 --> 11:31.690
- Long division, of course.
- Long division?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.693
- So easy, right?
Those were the days.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.228
Come on.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.898
And this is the supply room.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.667
You need to ask permission
before you take anything,

11:42.702 --> 11:43.869
even during recess,

11:43.904 --> 11:46.405
because sometimes
Mr. Phillips secretly naps here.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.510
Well, I'll be.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.782
That's Prissy Andrews
and the teacher, Mr. Phillips.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.585
- Are they married?
- Of course not.

11:59.620 --> 12:02.521
She's a student and he's... old.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.356
They're touching.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.126
- They must be making a baby.
- What?!

12:07.161 --> 12:08.794
- Well, if they're touching,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.296
that means they're having
intimate relations.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.965
- Really?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.968
- It seems to me that a lot
of husbands have a pet mouse.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.970
- Pet mouse?

12:18.005 --> 12:20.473
- That's what I've been told,
anyways.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.077
Yes, so I expect
Mr. Phillips has one, too,

12:25.112 --> 12:26.411
in his front pants pocket.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.681
I expect Prissy Andrews
has made its acquaintance.

12:29.716 --> 12:30.716
Mrs. Hammond -

12:30.751 --> 12:32.651
she's a lady
I used to work for -

12:32.686 --> 12:33.919
she said she always had twins

12:33.954 --> 12:35.254
after she pet
Mr. Hammond's mouse.

12:35.289 --> 12:37.723
(bell ringing)

12:49.903 --> 12:51.871
- Spell "ravishing."

13:17.831 --> 13:19.531
Correct. You may sit.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.134
Moody. Stand and deliver.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.407
Spell "dreadful."

13:34.248 --> 13:37.082
Like your handwriting.
(laughter)

13:40.754 --> 13:43.222
- Moody, it has an A in it,

13:43.257 --> 13:46.024
right after the E,
but the A is silent.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.660
- Yes, the A is silent.
As should you be.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.930
You're the, um, orphan, yes?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.298
- My name
is Anne Shirley-Cuthbert.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.567
And please be sure
to spell Anne with an E.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.237
- Did I call on you?
- You just asked me a question?

13:58.272 --> 13:59.738
Did. I.

13:59.773 --> 14:02.040
Call. On. You?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.609
- No?

14:03.644 --> 14:05.244
- Then sit down.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.079
(students giggling)

14:18.125 --> 14:21.760
- There's bread and cheese
in the pantry for your lunch.

14:21.795 --> 14:24.596
I expect I'll be back
well before milking.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.165
I daresay this meeting
takes a bite out of the day.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.567
- You're sure about this,
Marilla?

14:28.602 --> 14:31.169
- Oh, I can't say I quite know
what I got myself into,

14:31.204 --> 14:33.205
but there's no harm

14:33.240 --> 14:35.274
in learning something new.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.643
Seeing as how we're...

14:37.678 --> 14:39.444
parents and all.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.480
In case it escaped your notice.

14:41.515 --> 14:43.782
- Up until now,
I hadn't really...

14:43.817 --> 14:45.584
thought of it that way.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.185
- Well, there's truth to it,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.822
so you'd better get used
to the idea.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.310
(laughter)
(indistinct chatter)

15:12.479 --> 15:14.880
- Anne!

15:14.915 --> 15:16.815
Come here!

15:20.220 --> 15:22.454
- I thought lunchtime
would never arrive!

15:22.489 --> 15:24.456
- I feel the same way.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.259
- I'm just so excited to hear
about everything that you saw.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.327
- Me, too!
- Me, three!

15:28.362 --> 15:29.861
- What do you mean?

15:29.896 --> 15:33.732
- Prissy and Mr. Phillips,
silly. In the supply room?

15:33.767 --> 15:36.301
- I told them
about the pet mouse.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.337
- It's just all so shocking.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.172
- I wasn't too sure about it,
though,

15:40.207 --> 15:41.606
so I thought
maybe you could tell them.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.875
(laughter)
- I just can't believe it.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.210
- Me, neither.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.512
- Prissy and Mr. Phillips
are having intimate relations

15:47.547 --> 15:48.747
all right.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.084
(giggling)
It's a pretty common occurrence.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.953
- But you don't really think
she...

15:54.988 --> 15:56.922
touched it, do you?

15:56.957 --> 15:59.858
- His pet mouse?
(laughter)

15:59.893 --> 16:02.928
- I spy with my little eye--
- Go away!

16:02.963 --> 16:05.631
- Stop spying!
- Stupid boys!

16:06.867 --> 16:08.967
- Are they really making a baby?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.836
(laughter)
- It's disgusting!

16:10.871 --> 16:12.170
He's the teacher.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.506
- Then again, Prissy does look
quite grown up this year.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.274
- Do you think they're in love?
- When it comes

16:16.309 --> 16:18.410
to intimate relations,
I'm not sure it matters.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.178
(all giggling)

16:20.213 --> 16:22.447
- Oh, my!

16:22.482 --> 16:23.682
- Do tell, Anne.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.350
- Well, in my experience

16:25.385 --> 16:27.052
with Mrs. Hammond
and her drunken husband--

16:27.087 --> 16:30.222
- Drunken husband?!
- Oh, my.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.557
- They're the people you lived with
before you came to Green Gables?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.493
- They were the last ones, yes.

16:34.528 --> 16:36.528
- And he was a drunkard?

16:36.563 --> 16:39.064
- Oh, indeed.
- Oh, Anne...

16:39.099 --> 16:41.033
- Mr. Hammond always
had his moonshine,

16:41.068 --> 16:43.902
and after he'd partaken,
he would stomp around the house

16:43.937 --> 16:47.372
like Frankenstein's monster
and everybody would run!

16:47.407 --> 16:49.207
But nobody faster
than Mrs. Hammond,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.810
because she knew he was going
to make her pet his mouse.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.413
- And did she?
- I believe she had to.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.915
(girls giggling)
- Oh, my.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.683
- I could hear everything!

16:58.718 --> 17:00.852
- Everything?

17:00.887 --> 17:03.388
- To this day, I don't know
quite what to make of it.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.390
There were times
I heard laughing

17:05.425 --> 17:07.059
and it sounded like fun,

17:07.094 --> 17:10.228
but there were other times
I was sure he was murdering her.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.329
Either way,

17:11.364 --> 17:13.098
it sure made Mrs. Hammond mad.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.900
And the next morning,
more often as not,

17:14.935 --> 17:17.102
she would take after me
with a wooden spoon.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.237
I'll confess
that I was relieved

17:19.272 --> 17:21.073
when Mr. Hammond dropped dead.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.108
I didn't miss the sting
of his belt one bit.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.112
Is lunchtime over already?

17:27.147 --> 17:30.816
- No.
I won't eat next to dirty trash.

17:30.851 --> 17:33.986
Come on, girls,
before we all become tarnished.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.061
Diana?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.797
- I...

17:49.069 --> 17:50.469
Oh, dear.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.905
Let me go see
if there's anything to be done.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.583
- My sister has written to me
about our current book,

18:04.618 --> 18:06.251
The Grasshoppers,
by Mrs. Andrew Dean.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.053
- Her sister is a Suffragette.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.388
- She regularly sends me
progressive periodicals

18:10.423 --> 18:12.591
from Acadia University.
- Which she attended.

18:12.626 --> 18:14.226
- My sister writes

18:14.261 --> 18:17.229
that the book reviewer for the
Athenaeum described this story as

18:17.264 --> 18:20.599
"a woman's flirtation
with feminism."

18:20.634 --> 18:24.102
- Feminism.
What an incredible word.

18:24.137 --> 18:27.139
- How very intriguing.
- But what exactly does it mean?

18:27.174 --> 18:28.807
- I loved this story.

18:28.842 --> 18:32.177
It changed my thinking about
higher education for women.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.979
- My mother still believes

18:34.014 --> 18:36.581
it's scandalous for women
to attend college.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.116
It's a forbidden topic.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.218
- We're also an informal
book club,

18:40.253 --> 18:41.553
in case you hadn't noticed.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.822
- You can be next in line
to read this after Margaret,

18:43.857 --> 18:46.024
if you like.
- Thank you.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.493
- Oh, I hope you're a girl.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.363
You'll be a modern woman
in a modern society.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.199
- Times have certainly changed.
- Indeed.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.602
My mother was quite disappointed
when I came along.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.137
She only wanted boys.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.673
- Well, your farm
is exceedingly large.

19:01.708 --> 19:05.110
- And now your Prissy is sitting
for her college-entrance exams.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.979
- I want her to have
every advantage in life.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.481
And Jane.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.983
- You see? That's feminism.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.786
Good for you, Miss Cuthbert,
for choosing a girl.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.022
It's very forward-thinking.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.692
Treat yourself
while you still have time.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.394
- Oh!
(laughter)

19:23.730 --> 19:26.898
- And you're educating her.
Is she quite... bright?

19:26.933 --> 19:30.702
- Oh, well, Anne's inquisitive,
that's for sure and certain.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.704
She loves to read.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.240
She has a real appetite
for learning.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.909
- Are you hoping she'll go into
one of the feminine professions?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.878
- Mm. Maybe she'll be a teacher
one day?

19:39.913 --> 19:41.379
- Perhaps so.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.415
- This is why we must strive
to improve the curriculum

19:43.450 --> 19:44.749
for our girls.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.219
- Especially for those
who are unlikely to marry.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.388
At our last meeting, we were
discussing the curriculum

19:50.423 --> 19:52.557
and perhaps compiling
a list of suggestions.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.626
(background chatter)

19:56.463 --> 19:59.264
- Bye.
(background chatter)

20:10.310 --> 20:12.978
- Come along, Anne.
I can walk you partway home.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.847
-<i> Isn't it nice to think that</i>
<i>tomorrow is a new day</i>

20:15.882 --> 20:17.749
with no mistakes in it yet?

20:17.784 --> 20:21.620
There must be a limit to the
mistakes one person can make.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.456
I wanna get to the end of them,
then I'll be through with them.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.524
That's a very comforting
thought.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.494
- Don't worry, I'm sure
the girls will come around

20:29.529 --> 20:31.162
to liking you real soon.

20:31.197 --> 20:33.532
Maybe talk a bit less?

20:34.534 --> 20:36.501
And... no mice.

20:36.536 --> 20:40.038
(soft music)
See you tomorrow, Anne.

20:45.879 --> 20:48.380
(soft music)

20:49.883 --> 20:51.883
(bird cawing)

21:21.981 --> 21:24.683
- And when I heard
you attended one of their...

21:24.718 --> 21:27.185
their whatever you call its--
- Meeting.

21:27.220 --> 21:30.188
- You could've knocked me over
with a feather, that's what!

21:30.223 --> 21:32.190
I'm mystified by you.

21:32.225 --> 21:34.392
Shocked and mystified!

21:34.427 --> 21:36.394
Marilla Cuthbert, Suffragette!

21:36.429 --> 21:38.964
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- A Progressive Mother?

21:39.599 --> 21:42.067
- I'm still a bit surprised
about the mother part myself.

21:42.102 --> 21:44.369
- Well, don't ask me
for my advice,

21:44.404 --> 21:46.071
I've only had 10 children.

21:46.106 --> 21:47.806
(sighing)

21:47.841 --> 21:52.844
Tell me everything. I mean it.
Don't leave out a single detail.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.046
- If you're so curious,
you should consider attending.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.450
- Why on earth would I join
a group of Young Mothers?

22:00.053 --> 22:03.055
Tea, please.
I must have fortification.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.027
- It was a lively discussion.

22:09.062 --> 22:13.498
- Lively. Did you each take
turns shouting atop a soapbox?

22:13.533 --> 22:16.668
- There was a lot of civilized
talk about women's education

22:16.703 --> 22:18.103
and social reforms.

22:18.138 --> 22:20.071
- Next you'll be telling me
you all burned your corsets

22:20.106 --> 22:21.873
and danced naked at Town Hall.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.875
- We ran out of time.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.581
Admittedly,
I felt rather at sea.

22:29.616 --> 22:32.016
There's so much changing
these days.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.919
So much I'd never thought
about before.

22:34.954 --> 22:38.022
- Not that you'd ever thought
about being a mother until Anne.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.758
- That's what I'm saying.

22:39.793 --> 22:40.859
What if...

22:40.894 --> 22:43.628
what if I'm not equal
to the task?

22:43.663 --> 22:45.563
- Motherhood is simple.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.632
Controversial ideas
just complicate the matter

22:47.667 --> 22:49.467
unnecessarily.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.504
Matthew, did you condone
this little adventure?

22:52.539 --> 22:55.140
- Huh? I just come in for tea.

22:55.175 --> 22:56.975
- So were you just fine
and dandy

22:57.010 --> 22:58.176
with Marilla traipsing off?

22:58.211 --> 23:00.412
- Don't put him in the middle.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.748
- I'll, uh... I'll just take it
outside with me.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.818
- I'd like to hear what he makes
of all this modern thinking.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.753
- Um...

23:08.788 --> 23:12.757
I reckon every new idea...
was modern once.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.459
Until it wasn't.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.832
- Well!

23:22.502 --> 23:24.669
Well, well, well.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.674
(cattle lowing)

23:37.517 --> 23:39.518
- Hi there! Hi, Jerry!

23:50.563 --> 23:54.032
- You've become a woman
of drastic actions of late.

23:54.067 --> 23:56.034
I barely know you anymore.

23:56.069 --> 23:57.535
- You know, there's a difference

23:57.570 --> 23:59.204
between having an opinion
about something

23:59.239 --> 24:00.472
and pronouncing judgment!

24:02.008 --> 24:04.642
I'm not sorry
I went to that meeting,

24:04.677 --> 24:07.745
even if it did serve to point
out everything I don't know.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.380
- Hmm!

24:09.415 --> 24:11.983
- I feel I need to expand my thinking
if I'm going to do right by Anne.

24:12.018 --> 24:15.487
- That girl is not a usual sort of
person, that's for sure and certain.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.988
- At least we can agree on that.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.160
- The two of you
are an inspiration!

24:22.195 --> 24:25.196
To think that you've been
friends since school.

24:25.231 --> 24:28.166
Kindred spirits forever!
How do you do it?

24:28.201 --> 24:30.201
What's your secret?

24:30.236 --> 24:32.337
- How was your first day
at school?

24:32.372 --> 24:34.372
- I think it went really,
really well.

24:34.407 --> 24:36.407
Very well indeed.
I'm just so happy to be there.

24:36.442 --> 24:40.078
I'll just put my things away and then I'll
be right back down to help you with supper!

24:47.420 --> 24:49.588
- Keep me posted
about the next meeting.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.290
If you like.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.826
I'll be happy
to offer my opinion.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.963
- I have no doubt you will.
(chuckling)

25:00.300 --> 25:02.033
(soft music)

25:05.538 --> 25:07.272
(sighing)

25:17.750 --> 25:20.385
(sighing)
- Long division...

25:20.420 --> 25:23.388
it must be
like backwards multiplication.

25:23.423 --> 25:26.091
It can't be that hard
to figure out.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.131
(sighing)

25:41.474 --> 25:44.909
(chickens clucking)
(rooster crowing)

25:44.944 --> 25:46.645
(soft music)

25:53.119 --> 25:55.086
Today will be better.

25:55.121 --> 25:58.456
I'm not going to say anything
weird or...

25:58.491 --> 26:00.759
do anything wrong.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.296
You're my friend, right, Belle?

26:04.964 --> 26:07.932
You'll always be my friend,
won't you?

26:07.967 --> 26:11.536
- You bet. I'm so flattered.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.005
- You shouldn't eavesdrop, Jerry.
- E-what?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.074
(sighing)

26:16.109 --> 26:18.143
(soft music)

26:23.650 --> 26:26.117
- I just have to remember
what Jane Eyre said:

26:26.152 --> 26:28.119
"Life appears to me too short
to be spent

26:28.154 --> 26:31.656
in nursing animosity
or registering wrongs."

26:33.993 --> 26:36.027
- Anne of Green Gables.

26:36.062 --> 26:40.098
You and me...
we're gonna talk.

26:40.133 --> 26:42.900
You said some pretty nasty stuff
about my sister.

26:42.935 --> 26:46.004
- Who's your sister?
- Prissy Andrews, dummy.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.740
- I'm sure I didn't mean
to be nasty.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.843
- Is that why she was crying
all night?

26:51.878 --> 26:54.379
My parents say that's slander.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.081
You wanna get slandered?

26:57.116 --> 26:59.384
- Sorry, I truly meant no harm.
(Billy laughing)

27:00.987 --> 27:03.121
- I'm gonna teach you a lesson,
Fido.

27:03.156 --> 27:04.822
You're a bad dog.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.958
Bad little dog!

27:06.993 --> 27:08.493
- Hey, Billy!

27:13.533 --> 27:15.033
How's it going?

27:17.704 --> 27:19.671
- Hey, Gilbert.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.173
- Man, it's... it's, um,
it's good to be back.

27:22.208 --> 27:26.010
- Uh... yeah...

27:26.045 --> 27:27.679
yeah, welcome back.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.314
- Yeah, it's good to see you,
buddy.

27:30.349 --> 27:33.451
So you guys playing a game
or something? Right?

27:33.486 --> 27:36.554
Looks fun, but we should
probably get to school, eh?

27:37.390 --> 27:39.290
Hate to be tardy.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.693
Mr. Phillips sure gets
his dander up about that.

27:41.728 --> 27:44.162
- Yeah.
I was just about to get going.

27:44.197 --> 27:46.598
See ya there.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.237
- You all right, miss?

27:54.440 --> 27:56.608
- School...
- You're welcome.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.577
Need anything else?

27:59.612 --> 28:01.512
Any dragons around here
need slaying?!

28:01.547 --> 28:03.214
- No, thank you!

28:04.383 --> 28:06.918
- Who are you?

28:07.887 --> 28:09.721
Hey, who are you?

28:16.763 --> 28:19.230
Uh, miss?

28:19.265 --> 28:21.433
What's your name? Miss?

28:23.102 --> 28:25.103
What,
you can't tell me your name?

28:35.114 --> 28:37.115
Here. Allow me.

28:38.785 --> 28:41.319
(background chatter)

28:43.656 --> 28:46.691
- I'm sorry if I was rude.

28:46.726 --> 28:47.759
I'm Anne.

28:47.794 --> 28:50.294
- I'm--
(all): Gilbert!

28:50.329 --> 28:52.530
- How was
the District of Alberta?

28:52.565 --> 28:54.599
Did you see
the Rocky Mountains?

28:54.634 --> 28:57.401
- They're pretty hard to miss.
- Were they big?

28:57.436 --> 29:00.905
- They're mountains.
- Is your dad feeling better?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.541
- Uh, we're both glad
to be back home.

29:03.576 --> 29:06.077
- Why were you walking
with that orphan girl?

29:06.112 --> 29:07.578
- Why not?

29:07.613 --> 29:09.413
- She's a loon.
- Says you.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.482
- Hope you didn't get any
asylum cooties.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.251
(laughter)

29:13.286 --> 29:16.321
- Uh-oh... there's one.
(laughter)

29:18.124 --> 29:20.758
Besides,
I don't care where she's from.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.794
A cute girl is a cute girl.

29:27.667 --> 29:30.968
- I don't know what you think you were
doing walking with Gilbert Blythe.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.737
- I-- - You can't talk
to Gilbert Blythe.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.907
- You can't even look at him...
Well, see for yourself.

29:35.942 --> 29:39.443
- Ruby has liked him
for three years.

29:39.478 --> 29:40.978
She has dibs.

29:41.013 --> 29:44.448
There, there. That nasty girl
didn't know any better.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.584
Just like yesterday,
with all your tall tales.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.986
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to walk with him.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.621
It just happened.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.623
- Well, don't let it happen
again.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.827
- I won't. I promise. I'll have
nothing to do with him.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.195
(Ruby sniffling)

30:03.236 --> 30:05.270
- I'll try to smooth things
over.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.584
- There you are.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.623
- Mrs. Bell,
how nice to see you.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.725
- Hello.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.561
- I've been wondering
when the next meeting is.

30:30.596 --> 30:31.996
- Well, actually,
Miss Cuthbert--

30:32.031 --> 30:35.399
- Oh, please call me Marilla.
Everyone does.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.734
- Miss Cuthbert...

30:36.769 --> 30:39.904
we feel that our group
isn't the right fit for you.

30:44.644 --> 30:46.210
- I... I see.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.446
- We understand clearly now
that Anne needs

30:48.481 --> 30:51.349
all of your attention.
You've got your hands full.

30:51.384 --> 30:53.251
- All of my attention?

30:53.286 --> 30:57.054
- Also, we urge you
to consider home schooling.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.290
That would be best
for all concerned.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.225
And we are concerned.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.694
Good day to you.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.506
- What do you suppose
happened with Anne...

31:15.541 --> 31:17.608
they don't want
her back in school?

31:17.643 --> 31:19.644
- We'll know soon enough.

31:23.816 --> 31:25.950
- They don't want you back.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.986
- Leave me be, Matthew.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.574
- Open your readers to page 32.

31:50.609 --> 31:54.512
We will read aloud Barry
Cornwall's poem The Fisherman.

31:54.547 --> 31:57.248
- Finally,
something I can do well.

31:57.283 --> 32:00.685
- I'm happy for you, Anne.
- Diana Barry.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.253
Stand and begin.

32:10.496 --> 32:14.031
- "A... per-i-lous life,

32:14.066 --> 32:16.567
and sad as life may be,

32:16.602 --> 32:19.603
Hath the lone fisher

32:19.638 --> 32:22.606
on the lonely sea--"
- Perilous indeed.

32:22.641 --> 32:23.541
Sit down.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.811
New girl.

32:26.846 --> 32:29.047
Up. Continue.

32:35.221 --> 32:39.523
- "O'er the wild waters
labouring, far from home.

32:39.558 --> 32:43.260
For some bleak pittance
e'er compelled to roam.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.198
Few hearts to cheer him
through his dangerous life.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.501
And none to aid him
in the stormy strife.

32:50.536 --> 32:54.105
Companion of the sea
and silent air.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.208
The lonely fisher
thus must ever fare..."

32:57.243 --> 32:59.877
- She's good. Invested.

32:59.912 --> 33:03.347
- "Without the comfort,
hope, - with scarce a friend,

33:03.382 --> 33:08.019
he looks through life,
and only sees - its end!"

33:08.054 --> 33:10.554
(laughter)
- Sit down!

33:10.589 --> 33:12.289
Sweet merciful Lord.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.891
(indistinct chatter)

33:23.602 --> 33:25.269
- That was really different.
(laughter)

33:25.304 --> 33:27.071
- Josie Pye.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.273
Read Campbell's
Pleasures of Hope,

33:29.308 --> 33:31.075
The Downfall of Poland.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.643
- "O sacred Truth!

33:32.678 --> 33:35.279
thy triumph ceased awhile."

33:44.791 --> 33:46.925
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.961
I've got to fix
a bit of fence down yonder.

33:49.996 --> 33:52.463
So... I've been meaning
to attend to it.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.465
- Lunch is in an hour.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.303
- Well, I best get it done,
you know, before I forget again.

33:58.338 --> 34:01.072
So I might, uh, might be late.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.108
Jerry'll help you unload.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.613
- Walk on, Belle.<i> Allons.</i>

34:14.654 --> 34:16.655
(background chatter)

34:26.833 --> 34:30.168
- Hey, uh, I, uh, thought
you might like to try one.

34:30.203 --> 34:32.804
They're from our orchard.
They're real sweet.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.907
- Please go away.

34:35.942 --> 34:37.041
- I beg your pardon?

34:37.076 --> 34:41.079
- You need to walk away
right now.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.048
- I-I'm sorry, I, uh, can't--

34:44.083 --> 34:46.718
- I'm not supposed
to talk to you!

34:46.753 --> 34:49.688
- Why not?
- Argh!

34:55.695 --> 34:57.529
(birdsong)

35:11.678 --> 35:13.478
- Well, as I live and breathe.

35:13.513 --> 35:15.446
Matthew Cuthbert,
what are you doing here?

35:15.481 --> 35:17.482
Is everything all right?

35:17.517 --> 35:20.218
- Uh... Anne.

35:20.253 --> 35:23.021
- Ah, yes.

35:26.526 --> 35:27.892
Come on in.

35:28.861 --> 35:30.829
I know the whole story.

35:39.572 --> 35:42.940
- And the Andrews
are fit to be tied.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.877
(sighing)
I hope I didn't meddle too much,

35:45.912 --> 35:47.879
but I thought we ought to know,

35:47.914 --> 35:51.716
and Rachel's reliable
in the knowing department.

35:51.751 --> 35:54.419
- Dear Lord, that child
will put me in the grave.

35:57.590 --> 36:00.658
I cannot bear to think of her
spewing such filth.

36:00.693 --> 36:03.327
- It worries me to no end.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.563
- What a disgrace.

36:05.598 --> 36:08.199
Just wait until all of Avonlea
hears about this,

36:08.234 --> 36:09.701
if they haven't already.

36:09.736 --> 36:12.237
- I feel worried for Anne...
is what.

36:13.740 --> 36:17.742
- Matthew Cuthbert,
I don't understand you at all.

36:18.911 --> 36:21.212
That child is--
- A child.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.583
Burns me up!

36:26.919 --> 36:28.886
A girl of her tender age,

36:28.921 --> 36:30.922
she oughtn't to know
such things.

36:33.426 --> 36:35.260
(soft, dramatic music)

37:09.595 --> 37:11.362
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Andrews.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.231
- Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert.

37:13.266 --> 37:15.433
- I'm very sorry to disturb you,

37:15.468 --> 37:17.602
but... I wanted
to have a word with you

37:17.637 --> 37:20.772
about Anne...
and your daughter, Prissy.

37:20.807 --> 37:24.275
- Forgive me if I don't invite
you in, but seeing as your...

37:24.310 --> 37:27.111
girl set about sullying
my daughter's good name,

37:27.146 --> 37:28.746
I'm sure you can understand.

37:28.781 --> 37:32.683
- I want to apologize for
any discomfort this incident

37:32.718 --> 37:35.319
has caused Prissy
and your family.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.521
- Discomfort?

37:36.556 --> 37:39.824
My daughter is sorely
aggrieved, as am I.

37:39.859 --> 37:42.326
This outrage
will not be forgotten

37:42.361 --> 37:44.629
by anyone anytime soon.

37:44.664 --> 37:47.165
- We are dreadfully sorry.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.333
I'm sure Anne didn't mean
any harm.

37:49.368 --> 37:52.303
- How would you know?
- I beg your pardon?

37:52.338 --> 37:54.872
- Do you really know anything
about her?

37:54.907 --> 37:57.842
You didn't do Avonlea
any favours bringing that...

37:57.877 --> 38:00.111
trollop into our midst.

38:00.146 --> 38:01.479
- I beg your pardon?!

38:01.514 --> 38:02.814
- I think you heard me plain.

38:02.849 --> 38:05.283
- Well, hear this:

38:05.318 --> 38:08.486
You can hold Anne responsible
for what she said--

38:08.521 --> 38:09.954
- I can and most certainly do.

38:09.989 --> 38:11.956
- --but you can't hold
against her

38:11.991 --> 38:14.292
what she's seen
or been exposed to.

38:14.327 --> 38:16.127
That's not her fault.

38:16.162 --> 38:19.430
That child has endured more than
any of us can know or imagine.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.000
It's a shame
"progressive parenting"

38:23.035 --> 38:25.336
doesn't seem
to include compassion.

38:25.371 --> 38:28.306
But perhaps you'll muster
some up in church on Sunday

38:28.341 --> 38:29.841
and thank the good Lord

38:29.876 --> 38:33.044
that poor Anne has finally
found safe haven.

38:33.546 --> 38:35.046
I know I will.

38:35.548 --> 38:37.048
Good day.

38:43.723 --> 38:45.390
(cow lowing)

38:51.230 --> 38:53.197
- Did you go to school,
Mr. Cuthbert?

38:53.232 --> 38:54.565
- For a time.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.368
I left...
when I was about your age.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.771
- Do you know a word
called "eedrope"?

39:00.873 --> 39:02.540
- Eedrop...

39:03.209 --> 39:04.842
- Anne told me not to do it.

39:04.877 --> 39:06.711
- Eedrop.

39:08.047 --> 39:10.381
Don't think I know that one.

39:11.384 --> 39:15.053
I never saw Anne's beat
for knowing big words.

39:17.056 --> 39:19.090
- I bet she does very well
at school.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.730
(cow lowing)

40:13.179 --> 40:14.545
- Whoops.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.184
Hey...

40:22.922 --> 40:24.322
Carrots!

40:24.357 --> 40:26.190
- I'm not talking to you!
(exclamations)

40:29.695 --> 40:31.696
(laughter)

40:35.735 --> 40:37.201
- You just did.

40:42.408 --> 40:44.208
- Shirley!

40:44.243 --> 40:46.411
Get up here! Now!

40:48.647 --> 40:51.049
What a vicious display!

40:52.418 --> 40:54.752
Is this what they taught you
in that orphanage?

40:54.787 --> 40:58.923
Unacceptable!

41:03.863 --> 41:06.798
(laughter)
(indistinct chatter)

41:08.401 --> 41:14.038
"Anne Shirley
has a very bad temper."

41:14.073 --> 41:16.207
Now, stand here and stay put.

41:16.242 --> 41:19.043
And the rest of you, pipe down!!

41:19.078 --> 41:23.214
Let this serve as a lesson
to you that we do not tolerate

41:23.249 --> 41:26.017
such displays of temper

41:26.052 --> 41:29.020
here in a civilized society.

41:29.055 --> 41:31.055
- It was my fault, sir.

41:31.090 --> 41:32.656
I, uh, I-I teased her.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.526
- Quiet, Blythe.
That is hardly an excuse.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.761
(laughter)

41:36.796 --> 41:39.430
Quiet, all of you,
and return to your lesson.

41:41.767 --> 41:45.636
Thirty minus six
divided by three equals...

41:47.807 --> 41:49.807
(mournful music)

41:59.318 --> 42:01.152
Where do you think you're going?

42:03.089 --> 42:05.323
(voice fading):
Get back here!

42:08.027 --> 42:09.927
Shirley!

42:11.430 --> 42:12.730
Get back here.

42:20.473 --> 42:21.973
Shirley!

42:23.709 --> 42:26.144
(soft, dramatic music)

42:49.034 --> 42:50.868
- Anne!

43:02.481 --> 43:04.482
(sobbing)

43:07.319 --> 43:09.153
- There, there, child.

43:10.656 --> 43:12.289
I know.

43:12.324 --> 43:14.625
I know just how you feel.

43:14.660 --> 43:17.161
You've been judged harshly.

43:19.999 --> 43:23.000
- I am never going back
to school!

43:23.035 --> 43:24.802
Never!

43:38.984 --> 43:41.452
