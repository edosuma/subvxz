<i>I've had the best life.</i>

00:13.485 --> 00:15.605
<i>And I couldn't have wished</i>
<i>for a better bloke.</i>

00:17.365 --> 00:19.405
<i>But the world's gonna carry on</i>
<i>without me,</i>

00:19.485 --> 00:20.565
<i>and so are you.</i>

00:21.885 --> 00:22.725
<i>Have fun.</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:25.605
[inhales deeply]

00:26.645 --> 00:28.605
<i>And I want you to meet someone else.</i>

00:31.925 --> 00:33.605
<i>Someone nearly as lovely as me.</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:36.245
<i>Nearly.</i>

00:36.925 --> 00:38.365
-[Tony] <i>Hello.</i>
<i>-Hello, you.</i>

00:38.445 --> 00:39.605
-[Tony] <i>You all right?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

00:39.685 --> 00:41.085
-[Tony] <i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>-Twitter.</i>

00:59.725 --> 01:01.285
Right. Got a good lead for you.

01:01.725 --> 01:02.885
Local baby...

01:02.965 --> 01:04.685
looks exactly like Adolf Hitler.

01:06.245 --> 01:07.485
[sighs]

01:07.565 --> 01:09.325
-[woman] Ooooh! Hey!
-[parents giggling]

01:09.405 --> 01:11.165
[parents banging table]
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo!

01:11.445 --> 01:13.245
-[parents] Yeah!
-[baby gurgling]

01:13.325 --> 01:14.285
[woman] Boo!

01:14.365 --> 01:17.205
-[baby blows raspberry]
-So, um, is that a birthmark?

01:17.285 --> 01:18.525
Oh, no, it's eyeliner.

01:18.605 --> 01:21.125
We did it with marker pen at first,
but it took ages to get off.

01:21.205 --> 01:23.445
[man] Yeah, I mean,
this way we can do it when we want,

01:23.525 --> 01:25.565
then wipe it off if we need to.

01:25.645 --> 01:26.485
[Tony] So hold on,

01:26.565 --> 01:28.245
it doesn't really look like Hitler, then.

01:28.325 --> 01:29.565
[laughing] It does.

01:29.885 --> 01:32.205
[Tony] No. I mean naturally.

01:32.685 --> 01:34.765
It wasn't born
with its hair combed forward

01:34.845 --> 01:36.525
and a mustache, was it?

01:36.605 --> 01:38.925
-Nor was Hitler, to be fair.
-Good point.

01:39.005 --> 01:41.885
What I'm saying is,
it's not a revelation, is it?

01:42.325 --> 01:44.525
I mean, to get in the paper.

01:45.245 --> 01:47.605
"Baby born that looks a bit like Hitler,"

01:48.085 --> 01:49.325
mildly interesting...

01:49.405 --> 01:51.605
<i>if </i>it had a real mustache.

01:51.845 --> 01:56.005
But you can draw a mustache on <i>any </i>baby,
and it looks a bit like Hitler.

01:56.085 --> 01:57.165
Not a black one.

01:57.645 --> 01:58.805
Not as much.

01:58.885 --> 01:59.725
No.

01:59.925 --> 02:01.405
Well, then you'd probably...

02:01.485 --> 02:03.925
do a little Robert Mugabe... or something.

02:04.005 --> 02:06.925
Yeah, or a Chinese one.
We'd probably do...

02:07.245 --> 02:08.885
-Kim Jong-Un or something.
-[woman] Yeah.

02:08.965 --> 02:10.125
Or a Korean one, even.

02:10.405 --> 02:11.645
[Tony] One more question.

02:11.725 --> 02:14.485
Why do you want your baby
to look like Adolf Hitler?

02:15.005 --> 02:16.445
You're not fans, are you?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.685
We're not Nazis, no.

02:18.765 --> 02:21.605
-Just... a bit of fun, innit? I mean...
-Yeah.

02:21.685 --> 02:23.805
Hitler's the funniest thing to do,
I guess.

02:23.885 --> 02:25.765
-[woman chuckles]
-[baby gurgles]

02:27.565 --> 02:29.085
-Take a picture.
-Yep.

02:29.965 --> 02:31.285
-Smile.
-[woman chuckles]

02:31.685 --> 02:32.685
[camera clicks]

02:35.845 --> 02:39.445
So... will people do literally anything
to get in the local paper, then?

02:39.525 --> 02:40.525
It's a laugh, innit?

02:41.725 --> 02:43.005
-It <i>was</i> funny.
-Yeah.

02:44.125 --> 02:44.965
See?

02:47.285 --> 02:49.405
[keyboard clicking]

02:51.525 --> 02:53.365
They should get him a passport now,

02:53.445 --> 02:55.445
so he's stuck with that photo
for ten years.

02:57.685 --> 02:58.645
Oh, here she is.

02:58.725 --> 03:00.125
-[Kath] Right.
-[Tony] Go on.

03:00.205 --> 03:01.445
-If you were atheist...
-I am.

03:01.525 --> 03:03.325
-...and don't believe in an afterlife...
-I don't.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.645
If you don't believe
in heaven and hell and all that,

03:06.725 --> 03:09.765
why don't you just go around raping
and murdering as much as you want?

03:10.245 --> 03:11.085
I do.

03:11.445 --> 03:12.285
What?

03:12.645 --> 03:16.365
I do go around raping and murdering
as much as I want, which is not at all.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.805
'Cause he's got a conscience.

03:19.565 --> 03:22.565
But... if death is just the end,
what's the point?

03:22.645 --> 03:24.205
-[Tony] What's the point in what?
-Livin'!

03:24.485 --> 03:26.325
You might as well just kill yourself.

03:26.405 --> 03:27.765
So if you're watching a movie,

03:27.845 --> 03:30.405
and you're really enjoying it,
something with Kevin Hart in...

03:30.885 --> 03:31.725
Yeah.

03:31.805 --> 03:34.645
And someone points out
that this'll end eventually,

03:34.725 --> 03:38.445
do you just go, "Oh, forget it then.
What's the point?" and just turn it off?

03:38.845 --> 03:40.645
No, 'cause I can watch it again.

03:40.725 --> 03:43.525
Well, I think life is precious
'cause you <i>can't</i> watch it again.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.725
I mean, you can believe in an afterlife
if that makes you feel better.

03:46.805 --> 03:48.005
Doesn't mean it's true.

03:48.085 --> 03:51.085
But once you realize
you're not gonna be around forever,

03:51.165 --> 03:54.125
I think that's what makes life <i>so</i> magical.

03:54.725 --> 03:56.805
One day, you'll... eat your last meal,

03:57.205 --> 04:00.205
smell your last flower,
hug your friend for the very last time.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.125
You might not know it's the last time,

04:02.205 --> 04:06.325
so that's why you should do everything
you love with passion, you know?

04:06.405 --> 04:09.245
Treasure the few years you've got
because...

04:09.965 --> 04:11.125
that's all there is.

04:12.525 --> 04:15.325
I've watched <i>Ride Along 2</i> five times.

04:15.405 --> 04:17.845
-You haven't wasted your life, then.
-[Kath] Definitely not.

04:18.045 --> 04:18.885
No.

04:19.485 --> 04:22.125
-Love Kevin Hart, everything about him.
-[Tony] Yeah.

04:22.205 --> 04:24.205
His humor, his comedy...

04:24.765 --> 04:26.525
-his films...
-Comedy films, mainly.

04:26.605 --> 04:27.965
-Mainly, yeah.
-[Tony] Yeah.

04:28.165 --> 04:29.765
-Whatever gets you through.
-[Kath] Yeah.

04:29.885 --> 04:31.285
Well, thanks for coming over.

04:31.365 --> 04:32.205
Pleasure.

04:36.885 --> 04:37.725
Right.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.525
Is this the service for Julian Kane?

04:48.605 --> 04:49.725
It's already happened.

04:50.405 --> 04:51.445
Are you a relative?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.085
No, friend.

04:54.005 --> 04:55.285
Wasn't much of a do.

04:55.365 --> 04:56.365
Terrible turnout.

04:56.845 --> 04:58.245
Hope mine's not like that.

04:58.325 --> 04:59.325
Sure.

04:59.405 --> 05:01.805
I mean, I look forward to these things,
and then that happens.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.765
It's depressing.

05:02.845 --> 05:05.005
[sighing] Well, maybe the next one
will be more fun.

05:05.365 --> 05:06.205
Doubt it.

05:07.005 --> 05:07.845
Cot death.

05:23.645 --> 05:24.685
Friend of yours?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.965
Yeah. A... guy I used to work with.

05:28.045 --> 05:29.485
Ah, I'm sorry.

05:29.645 --> 05:32.285
Oh, don't breathe in the smoke, love.
You'll be off your tits.

05:33.005 --> 05:34.005
Trust me.

05:38.725 --> 05:40.285
-[Roxy] Hey.
-I missed it.

05:41.045 --> 05:42.085
Everyone did.

05:42.685 --> 05:43.645
Doesn't matter.

05:44.605 --> 05:45.525
How've you been?

05:46.805 --> 05:47.845
Yeah, good.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.285
The nurse who, um, looks after my dad,
I'm gonna...

05:54.885 --> 05:55.885
ask her out.

05:57.285 --> 05:58.565
-That's brilliant.
-Is it?

05:59.045 --> 05:59.885
Yeah.

06:00.405 --> 06:01.565
Another good man taken.

06:01.645 --> 06:02.485
Well...

06:02.965 --> 06:04.205
she hasn't said yes yet.

06:04.285 --> 06:05.325
She will.

06:06.485 --> 06:07.485
She'd be mad not to.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.805
I don't suppose you'll have time

06:09.885 --> 06:12.165
to associate with me
when you're all hooked up again.

06:12.245 --> 06:13.125
Stupid.

06:13.645 --> 06:14.765
Trust me.

06:15.005 --> 06:16.285
It gets complicated.

06:16.365 --> 06:18.565
No one wants their fella hanging out
with someone like me.

06:19.405 --> 06:20.245
Like you.

06:21.525 --> 06:22.725
A really nice person.

06:29.045 --> 06:30.765
-See you later.
-See you later.

06:56.325 --> 06:57.645
[Tony sighs]

07:01.845 --> 07:02.845
All right, Dad?

07:10.165 --> 07:12.605
The soldiers were here again today.

07:13.645 --> 07:14.725
[breathing heavily]

07:14.805 --> 07:16.605
[clock ticking]

07:18.245 --> 07:19.085
Were they?

07:19.645 --> 07:20.605
Yeah.

07:21.645 --> 07:22.605
Looking for me.

07:23.645 --> 07:25.005
I kept out of the way.

07:26.685 --> 07:27.725
[exhales]

07:27.965 --> 07:29.285
Were they British or German?

07:30.845 --> 07:31.685
German.

07:34.405 --> 07:35.405
Nazis, then?

07:36.365 --> 07:37.205
Yep.

07:38.245 --> 07:40.765
Best keep out the way...
till the war's over.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.285
You're a good boy.

07:46.765 --> 07:48.525
-Am I?
-Yeah.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.165
[sighs]

07:52.245 --> 07:53.205
What's my name?

07:53.805 --> 07:54.765
Tony.

07:55.525 --> 07:56.365
Yep.

07:57.325 --> 07:58.325
How do you know me?

08:00.525 --> 08:02.565
Well, you come here sometimes.

08:03.965 --> 08:05.605
Yep, I come here sometimes.

08:10.165 --> 08:12.965
[Tony sighs]

08:16.605 --> 08:17.925
You're <i>my</i> boy.

08:21.005 --> 08:21.845
Yep.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.605
You drew on the wallpaper, didn't ya?

08:29.205 --> 08:30.565
I did, yeah.

08:31.205 --> 08:32.085
When I was seven.

08:33.085 --> 08:34.005
You remember that?

08:34.405 --> 08:36.285
[chuckles]

08:36.365 --> 08:37.765
Your mum's furious.

08:38.405 --> 08:39.565
[laughing] She was.

08:40.565 --> 08:41.645
Don't worry about it.

08:43.085 --> 08:44.885
Got a spare roll down the shed.

08:45.845 --> 08:47.085
I'll do it tomorrow.

08:49.645 --> 08:50.965
You did it already, Dad.

08:51.045 --> 08:52.565
-You did it the next day.
-Yeah.

08:53.525 --> 08:56.045
[tuts] I'll do it tomorrow.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.125
I love you, Dad.

09:03.925 --> 09:04.765
Gay.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.685
[Tony snickers]

09:07.525 --> 09:08.525
[Tony sniffs]

09:13.325 --> 09:16.125
[Emma] ...falling down the back.
If you sit forward, I'll pull it up.

09:26.765 --> 09:27.845
Okay, right.

09:28.885 --> 09:30.405
I don't wanna do this anymore.

09:31.205 --> 09:32.285
I don't see the point.

09:32.765 --> 09:37.605
Well, I mean, therapy is a way
of helping you cope with your feelings.

09:37.685 --> 09:38.525
How?

09:38.925 --> 09:42.005
You're asking the question, which means
you're on the way to problem-solving.

09:42.085 --> 09:43.005
Am I?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.165
That's a great question.

09:44.245 --> 09:46.645
That's a great question, Tony.
[inhales deeply]

09:46.725 --> 09:49.325
We are here to help you change...

09:49.805 --> 09:53.325
the negative behavior
which contributes to your problems.

09:53.405 --> 09:54.525
What is my negative behavior?

09:54.605 --> 09:56.525
You've said yourself,
you wanna punish the world

09:56.605 --> 09:58.645
-as a result of your loss.
-Yeah.

09:58.725 --> 10:00.765
Some people deserve to be punished,

10:00.845 --> 10:01.725
including me.

10:02.005 --> 10:05.045
And I thought I could be the one
to administer the punishment,

10:05.125 --> 10:08.485
but my mistake was thinking
that <i>everyone </i>is an arsehole,

10:08.565 --> 10:09.565
and they're not.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.605
Some people are nice, right?

10:11.685 --> 10:15.445
And the trick is to find
who's nice and who's an arsehole.

10:15.885 --> 10:18.045
But arseholes are clever.
They pretend to be nice.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.125
They pretend to care about you, that...

10:20.205 --> 10:21.165
You're an arsehole.

10:21.765 --> 10:22.845
So I'm clever.

10:24.525 --> 10:25.445
Yeah.

10:28.405 --> 10:30.565
-So you wanna punish me?
-[Tony] I don't, actually.

10:30.645 --> 10:31.485
-No.
-No.

10:31.565 --> 10:34.605
I just... don't need you around anymore.

10:34.685 --> 10:35.725
I don't... [smacks lips]

10:37.325 --> 10:38.605
I don't need you anymore.

10:39.525 --> 10:40.445
Okay.

10:40.525 --> 10:42.325
You're not terrible, you know.

10:43.365 --> 10:44.365
You're not Hitler.

10:45.205 --> 10:46.405
You're a dickhead.

10:46.485 --> 10:47.525
You're a dick.

10:48.325 --> 10:50.405
[breathing deeply] You feel better, Tony?

10:50.685 --> 10:53.605
I do.
Maybe there's something in this, yeah.

10:53.685 --> 10:54.925
You absolute cock.

10:55.445 --> 10:56.965
You cock, you twat.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.645
[smacks lips]

10:59.725 --> 11:03.205
It was your brother-in-law Matt
that told me about you, and, er...

11:04.565 --> 11:05.965
we thought it would be a good idea--

11:06.045 --> 11:07.565
And I went along with it for a while.

11:07.645 --> 11:10.085
I don't know why. Like wiggling a tooth.
I knew you were a cock,

11:10.165 --> 11:12.965
-but I just thought I'd give it--
-Well, it seems to be helping him,

11:13.045 --> 11:15.445
what with his marriage
going down the fucking swanny.

11:15.725 --> 11:16.565
His what?

11:17.405 --> 11:19.045
Sorry. Naughty.

11:35.045 --> 11:36.805
Is everything okay with you and Jill?

11:37.885 --> 11:38.725
What?

11:39.085 --> 11:41.605
The psychiatrist said
you were having marriage problems.

11:41.685 --> 11:44.245
-Well, he shouldn't have done that.
-I know. He's a twat.

11:44.765 --> 11:45.605
Is it true?

11:47.325 --> 11:48.525
Yeah, we are.

11:48.605 --> 11:51.685
[sighs] What, you're...
What? You're working it out, though?

11:51.765 --> 11:53.365
Well, we're trying to, yeah.

11:53.445 --> 11:55.525
So you're not gonna...
split up or anything?

11:55.605 --> 11:57.205
-Just gonna--
-Well, maybe.

11:57.285 --> 11:58.125
Really?

11:58.325 --> 11:59.325
Oh, come on. Wha--

11:59.405 --> 12:03.485
Is it genuinely a revelation to you
that other people have problems, Tony?

12:03.645 --> 12:05.245
Because they do. Everyone does.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.005
Most people keep these things
to themselves.

12:07.085 --> 12:08.965
They don't go around
broadcasting it like you do,

12:09.045 --> 12:10.885
but everyone has bad shit in their lives.

12:10.965 --> 12:12.725
So the next time
you're rude to some waitress

12:12.805 --> 12:15.525
for getting your order wrong,
or make someone feel bad

12:15.605 --> 12:19.405
for saying something stupid, just know
that they might have just failed an exam,

12:19.485 --> 12:22.085
or been made redundant,
or found out their mum's got cancer.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.845
-What about George?
-What, like I haven't thought of that?

12:26.485 --> 12:28.685
He doesn't know anything's wrong.
He's more worried

12:28.765 --> 12:30.485
about his uncle acting mental,

12:30.605 --> 12:32.325
threatening to kill himself
and other people.

12:32.405 --> 12:33.245
Well...

12:33.645 --> 12:36.645
tell him he doesn't have to worry
about that... at least.

12:36.725 --> 12:37.685
That's not gonna happen.

12:37.765 --> 12:40.805
I'm not gonna tell him something
that might turn out to be a lie.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.205
I'm not gonna kill myself.

12:44.925 --> 12:45.765
Okay.

12:46.205 --> 12:47.125
[sighs]

12:47.805 --> 12:48.725
I'm sorry.

12:49.045 --> 12:50.045
No, you didn't know.

12:50.725 --> 12:52.445
No, not about this. I mean...

12:53.925 --> 12:54.885
about everything.

12:56.605 --> 12:57.645
Been a fuckin' pain.

13:01.845 --> 13:02.845
I like this job.

13:03.685 --> 13:06.565
I just used to be better at it.
Used to... try harder.

13:06.645 --> 13:07.485
But it's...

13:10.005 --> 13:11.165
it's a good place to work.

13:13.205 --> 13:14.365
Even with these idiots.

13:15.525 --> 13:17.165
And the little things do matter.

13:17.245 --> 13:21.685
This shitty little...
free, local newspaper.

13:22.365 --> 13:24.285
It kills a few minutes,

13:24.685 --> 13:25.685
in a good way.

13:27.125 --> 13:30.805
A smile 'cause someone
saved a blind kitten from a tree.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.805
It's not for reading, it's for being in.

13:32.885 --> 13:36.125
Everyone should be in the local paper
at least once.

13:37.085 --> 13:38.045
"I was 'ere."

13:40.165 --> 13:41.005
It's sweet.

13:45.605 --> 13:46.685
Cheers, Lenny.

13:47.165 --> 13:48.125
What for?

13:48.205 --> 13:50.245
For being my human stress ball.

13:50.765 --> 13:52.245
Letting me squeeze your neck.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.805
What a good fuckin' mate you are!

13:56.085 --> 13:56.925
Welcome.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.285
You're brilliant, Sandy.

14:00.085 --> 14:01.125
Smart,

14:01.205 --> 14:02.205
interested.

14:02.285 --> 14:03.405
Don't ever lose that.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.605
You can do whatever you want.

14:07.925 --> 14:09.005
And Kath.

14:09.925 --> 14:12.725
Thank you for annoying me every day,

14:13.165 --> 14:14.085
without fail.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.765
Your banal questions...

14:17.485 --> 14:18.525
they distracted me.

14:21.405 --> 14:22.685
So, cheers.

14:24.525 --> 14:25.805
Dunno what he's on about.

14:25.885 --> 14:27.365
I think he's being nice.

14:28.165 --> 14:30.125
Hmm. That's even weirder.

14:31.085 --> 14:32.005
[Tony] And...

14:32.605 --> 14:33.725
cheers, Matt.

14:34.245 --> 14:35.765
Thanks for never giving up.

14:37.765 --> 14:39.525
It must have been
like trying to free

14:39.605 --> 14:43.405
an injured, angry rat from a trap.

14:45.205 --> 14:47.565
You're doing it for its own good,
but it doesn't know that

14:47.645 --> 14:49.525
'cause it doesn't trust anyone anymore...

14:50.805 --> 14:51.885
so it lashes out.

14:53.405 --> 14:54.765
You can't change the world,

14:55.725 --> 14:57.965
but you can... you can change yourself.

15:01.045 --> 15:02.645
I'll try harder at that as well.

15:03.565 --> 15:04.685
I'll stick around.

15:05.085 --> 15:05.925
[Matt] So,

15:06.485 --> 15:07.485
I mean, I won, then?

15:08.885 --> 15:10.805
-Won what?
-I kept you alive long enough

15:10.885 --> 15:13.725
to decide you weren't going to kill
yourself and you could be happy again.

15:14.685 --> 15:15.645
Happy's a stretch.

15:16.485 --> 15:19.325
But you don't have to confiscate
my shoelaces anymore.

15:20.005 --> 15:20.845
Okay.

15:23.445 --> 15:24.325
Get back to work.

15:24.885 --> 15:26.645
Unless you've got somewhere better to be.

15:26.845 --> 15:28.485
I have got somewhere better to be.

15:30.405 --> 15:31.365
[Emma chuckles]

15:31.845 --> 15:33.765
Oh, back again.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.365
[Tony] Hi. Um...

15:37.885 --> 15:40.245
I was wondering if you wanted to go out...

15:40.805 --> 15:41.645
for a drink...

15:42.205 --> 15:43.085
or a meal.

15:44.045 --> 15:45.165
Oh, er...

15:46.725 --> 15:47.885
I'm not mad anymore.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.245
I'm a bit mad.

15:49.325 --> 15:50.245
[Emma chuckles]

15:50.325 --> 15:52.245
But no madder than anyone else.

15:52.605 --> 15:55.005
I don't know if it's the right thing.
I just...

15:55.085 --> 15:55.925
Okay.

15:57.725 --> 16:00.005
Well, I mean,
can I say I'll think about it?

16:00.245 --> 16:01.085
Yep.

16:01.565 --> 16:02.445
I'll take that.

16:03.165 --> 16:04.605
Think about it. That's good.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.045
There's hope.

16:06.765 --> 16:07.885
Hope is everything.

16:10.565 --> 16:11.765
I don't know what to say.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.725
Just say yes.

16:33.965 --> 16:34.925
I asked her out.

16:36.565 --> 16:37.405
The nurse?

16:38.205 --> 16:39.845
Oh, excellent!

16:39.925 --> 16:42.165
She's thinking about it, so...

16:45.525 --> 16:46.365
How are you?

16:47.845 --> 16:48.685
I mean...

16:49.805 --> 16:50.645
are you...

16:52.045 --> 16:53.485
-Am I happy?
-Yeah.

16:54.165 --> 16:55.165
[chuckles]

16:55.845 --> 16:56.685
Yes.

16:58.645 --> 17:01.645
I had the most wonderful life with Stan.

17:02.925 --> 17:04.685
And I have all those memories.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.405
That's all we are anyway,
really, memories.

17:09.925 --> 17:12.605
And Stan had a wonderful life, too,

17:12.685 --> 17:14.165
and he's not in any pain.

17:14.845 --> 17:17.125
Doesn't even know it's over. [laughs]

17:17.725 --> 17:18.725
I do.

17:20.805 --> 17:21.925
But I'd rather live...

17:22.645 --> 17:23.485
missing him...

17:24.125 --> 17:26.085
than for him to live missing me.

17:26.165 --> 17:27.605
That's how much I love him.

17:28.165 --> 17:29.525
I wouldn't change anything.

17:31.045 --> 17:35.725
If I went back and changed one thing
I didn't like, I might lose something

17:35.845 --> 17:38.165
that that bad thing eventually took me to.

17:38.245 --> 17:39.885
You shouldn't regret anything,

17:40.325 --> 17:45.725
or think, "Well, if I went back,
I might do this or I might do that."

17:47.045 --> 17:49.005
I'd go back to 1998...

17:49.645 --> 17:53.325
and punch Gavin Tilley
in the face for looking at Lisa.

17:54.085 --> 17:56.285
-For looking at her?
-It was the way he looked at her.

17:56.605 --> 17:57.565
He winked.

17:59.565 --> 18:00.645
She ignored it.

18:00.725 --> 18:02.205
I pretended I hadn't seen it.

18:02.445 --> 18:04.965
I knew it was wrong to punch him, but...

18:06.085 --> 18:07.445
Also, I think I was embarrassed

18:07.525 --> 18:11.165
about being jealous over something, so...

18:11.605 --> 18:14.005
But now I wish
I'd punched him in the face.

18:14.085 --> 18:16.085
[Anne laughs]

18:17.365 --> 18:18.805
I found myself...

18:19.165 --> 18:22.205
ranting about how life's worth living
today at work

18:22.285 --> 18:24.285
for the first time since Lisa died,

18:25.405 --> 18:27.165
and, uh, that's your fault.

18:29.445 --> 18:30.285
And I thought...

18:31.405 --> 18:32.485
I'm gonna carry on...

18:33.805 --> 18:36.445
saying and doing... what I want, and...

18:36.805 --> 18:39.605
punishing the world, but I'm gonna
punish people<i> </i>who deserve it.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.365
I'm gonna use my superpower for good.

18:43.765 --> 18:44.605
'Cause...

18:45.245 --> 18:48.165
when I was doing and saying
exactly what I wanted,

18:48.925 --> 18:50.605
it always <i>felt</i> better...

18:51.285 --> 18:53.285
when it was also the right thing to do.

18:54.445 --> 18:56.445
Know what I mean? If you're a good person,

18:56.845 --> 19:01.205
doing things you want to do
is the same as doing good.

19:03.085 --> 19:04.325
And you're a good person,

19:04.405 --> 19:06.725
and I'd really rather
you didn't kill yourself.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.965
Because it would be a waste.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.965
You may not like living much,

19:14.325 --> 19:16.445
but you make the world a better place.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.965
And don't give up...

19:20.445 --> 19:21.725
because then they've won.

19:23.045 --> 19:24.485
And they grow in numbers.

19:25.125 --> 19:25.965
Who?

19:26.045 --> 19:28.725
Arseholes, you know,
like Gavin fuckin' Tilley.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.165
[Tony laughs]

19:30.565 --> 19:31.965
Gavin fuckin' Tilley.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.245
Ugh.

23:33.805 --> 23:34.725
Do you like him?

D'you know, I've worked in this job for...

23:39.565 --> 23:41.045
God, 25 years,

23:41.125 --> 23:45.045
and, I mean, I've seen lonely people,
people dying, people in pain,

23:45.125 --> 23:47.685
people who've got nothing,
and yet I... [exhales]

23:48.245 --> 23:51.725
I don't think I've ever met anyone
quite as... sad as him.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.725
And he did it to himself. It's like...

23:55.365 --> 23:58.805
I don't know, he's... he's tried to, like,
turn his heart into stone

23:58.885 --> 24:02.045
so that he wouldn't actually feel anything
'cause it was just all...

24:03.045 --> 24:04.885
really painful for him.

24:05.725 --> 24:06.565
And yet,

24:07.405 --> 24:09.205
