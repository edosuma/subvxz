Welcome.

may be wondering where

01:50.444 --> 01:52.346
we've been
since we saw you last.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.515
Well, it's quite a tale.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.685
A tale of two heroes
on a quest to score,

01:57.751 --> 01:59.687
across time and space.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.956
It's a story of sex, violence,

02:03.023 --> 02:05.259
- Yeah, and fire, heh, yeah,
fire, heh.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.760
Yeah, don't forget about that.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.597
- It all began
one ordinary day,

02:09.663 --> 02:12.132

- What are you two doing?

02:24.044 --> 02:25.346
- Ow! Heh.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.748
- Uh...we're trying to
find out how many times

02:27.815 --> 02:30.251
I can kick Beavis in the nads
before he passes out.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.585
- Yeah, heh.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.922
- And that's your
science fair project?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.089
- Uhh...

02:36.156 --> 02:37.391
what science fair?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.792
- Yeah, what's that?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.461
- Heh heh
- Heh heh heh.

02:40.528 --> 02:44.432
- Well, it's too bad you didn't
take this more seriously, okay?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.367
The winner
of the science fair this year

02:46.434 --> 02:50.070

to NASA Space Camp.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.339
- Whoa.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.540
Space camp?

02:52.606 --> 02:53.907
That's pretty cool, Butt-Head.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.944
What if we really
did do a nad-kicking

02:57.010 --> 02:59.247
science experiment and,
and like,

02:59.313 --> 03:00.548
we did measurements

03:00.614 --> 03:02.483
and we wrote stuff down
with a pencil

03:02.550 --> 03:03.751
like you're supposed to and--

03:03.817 --> 03:06.119
and maybe we could prove
everybody wrong

03:06.186 --> 03:08.121
and win the whole science--

03:08.188 --> 03:09.223
[whack]

03:09.290 --> 03:10.958

[inspirational music plays]

03:14.395 --> 03:17.965

for our science fair project.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.468
Heh heh heh heh.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.203
Uh, okay, now stand here.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.205
- Okay.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.475
- Heh heh heh.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.909
- Okay.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.044
You're not gonna kick me
in the nads again, are you?

03:31.111 --> 03:32.580
- No, I'm not, Beavis.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.814
Those days are over.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.617
- Oh, good. That's a relief.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.586
That is the best news
I've heard all day.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.255

Beavis,
what the hell are you doing?

04:03.243 --> 04:07.047
- Did we win the science fair?
- Even better, Beavis.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.248
We kicked its ass.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.517
Check it out.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.219
- Whoa! Fire! Fire!

04:12.286 --> 04:14.922
Fire! Heh. Fire!

04:15.789 --> 04:17.057
- Beavis and Butt-Head,

04:17.124 --> 04:19.427
this court
hereby finds you guilty.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.562
- Yes!
- Yeah!

04:21.629 --> 04:22.596
Kick-ass, yeah.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.733
- Please rise.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.369
Do you have anything
to say before I pass sentence?

04:28.436 --> 04:31.038
- Uhh, if it like
pleased the court,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.573
or something?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.709
In my defense, I was trying
to kick Beavis in the nads.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.580
- And I just want to say,
Your Majesty,

04:39.647 --> 04:43.016
that, um, the explosions
were really cool.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.319
Amen. Heh heh.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.755
- Many have said,
when it comes to sentencing,

04:47.821 --> 04:49.623
I'm the toughest
judge in the state.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.091
And they're right.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.961
But last night,
I watched a show called

04:54.027 --> 04:56.864
"Touched by an Angel,"
and it made me think.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.266
When I look at
these two boys today,

04:59.333 --> 05:02.035
I don't see their failure.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.971
I see our failure.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.106
- He said "touched."
- Heh heh heh.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.341
- Heh, heh, yeah, heh.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.677
- You boys like explosions,
don't you?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.311
- Uh. Yeah.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.080
- And fire.
Heh heh heh.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.182
- Well, you know who else
liked explosions?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.685
Neil Armstrong.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.987
And the only difference
between him and you

05:20.053 --> 05:22.590
is he had the benefit of
supportive families

05:22.656 --> 05:23.991
and teachers.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.826
- Families.
Heh heh heh.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.095
- You know what
Neil Armstrong did?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.196
- Did he score?

05:29.262 --> 05:31.599
- He was
the first man on the moon.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.833
- Yeah, yeah.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.267
- We never found out who

05:34.334 --> 05:35.936
won that trip to space camp,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.906
because the records were lost
when the gym burned down.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.375
But whoever it was
is going to be fine.

05:41.442 --> 05:45.713
They're going to go on to good
colleges and fine careers.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.716
So I say,
why not give opportunity

05:48.782 --> 05:51.018
to those who really need it

05:51.084 --> 05:54.622
and unlock the potential
of these two at-risk youths?

05:54.688 --> 05:57.691
I hereby sentence
Beavis and Butt-Head

05:57.758 --> 06:01.361
to eight weeks of Space Camp.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.296

- Boi-oi-oi-oing...

06:20.380 --> 06:21.549
- Good morning.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.216
I'm Commander Serena Ryan,

06:23.283 --> 06:25.819
and I'm captain of
the Space Shuttle Endeavor.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.354
And I'm Jim Hartson,

06:27.421 --> 06:29.222
the lieutenant commander,
which is also an important--

06:29.289 --> 06:30.958
- This week,
you'll have a front row seat

06:31.024 --> 06:33.326
while we prepare to take
a very important mission

06:33.393 --> 06:34.628
into space.
- Yep.

06:34.695 --> 06:35.929
- We're gonna bring a new

06:35.996 --> 06:37.865
telescope to the
Mir space station

06:37.931 --> 06:41.168
and use it to observe
a small black hole.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.670
- Hole.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.071
- Heh heh heh heh.
- Heh. Heh.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.739
- Albert Einstein
and Nathan Rosen theorized

06:45.806 --> 06:47.174
black holes could contain rifts

06:47.240 --> 06:50.143
in the very fabric of
the universe, or wormholes,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.780
that could allow one to travel
through time and space.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.948
- Wormhole?
Uh-heh-heh.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.285
- Yeah, I always wondered
how worms score.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.721
- To my right here is
a model of the entry port

07:00.788 --> 07:02.690
of Russia's Mir Space Station,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.091
where we're going to
have to execute

07:04.157 --> 07:06.326
a very
difficult docking maneuver.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.762
I'm going to turn things over
to Officer Hartson now

07:08.829 --> 07:11.499
and he's going
to show us how it works.

Now, the fun stuff--
Orbital mechanics.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.522
- Yeah.
- Heh heh heh.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.790
- I hope
you're not spending

08:09.857 --> 08:11.759
too much with the space
campers, Serena.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.761
NASA has a lot
riding on this mission.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.529
- Hey, you guys
have to see this.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.897
It's amazing.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.032
- Ooh, yeah!
- It's these two kids

08:19.099 --> 08:20.868
from Space Camp--
they're phenomenal!

08:20.934 --> 08:22.870
They've been doing this
for 18 hours

08:22.936 --> 08:25.005
without food or water.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.007
It's almost like
they have an unhealthy

08:27.074 --> 08:28.909
single-minded obsession with it.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.878
- Check this out, Butt-Head.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.280
[whirring]
[Beavis snickers]

08:39.687 --> 08:41.088
- They're using
the robotic arm

08:41.154 --> 08:43.757
as a secondary backup
in case of mechanical failure.

08:43.824 --> 08:44.925
No one's ever thought of that.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.027
- Incredible.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.796
- They're brilliant.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.664
- Wait a minute.

08:50.731 --> 08:54.301
What if we brought them on
the mission to do the docking?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.670
- You want those two
to go up in space

08:56.737 --> 08:58.639
and dock the actual
space shuttle

08:58.706 --> 09:00.207
to the Mir space station?

09:00.273 --> 09:01.842
- And also, I thought
I was gonna do that--

09:01.909 --> 09:03.110
- Think of the PR.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.212
Two at-risk youths
turned astronauts?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.180
We could finally
get Americans interested

09:07.247 --> 09:08.582
in the space program again.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.084
What do we have to lose?
- Nothing, I don't think.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.820
- They'll never make it
through the training.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.655
- But if they do?

09:14.722 --> 09:16.489
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.659
- We'll see.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.161
- Oohh, yeah.
- Hey, boys.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.396
- Shut up! We're busy.
- Let me ask you something.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.399
How would you guys
like to do that...

09:26.466 --> 09:28.836
but do it for real?

09:28.902 --> 09:31.504
- Whoa. You want us
to do that...

09:31.571 --> 09:34.041
for real?
- Whoa. Heh heh.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.777
- That's right. I want you
to do that for real.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.879
In space, with me.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.948
- W-w-with you? Heh. Heh.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.783
- That's right.
- Whoa!

09:42.850 --> 09:44.151
- Yes!
- Absolutely.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.186
- Yes! A thousand times yes!

09:46.253 --> 09:49.289
- I like your enthusiasm.
But it's gonna be hard work.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.892
You're gonna have to practice
doing this a lot.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.861
For hours, every day.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.428
- Yeah, I--I already do.
Yeah, heh.

09:55.495 --> 09:56.797
In the bathroom, yeah.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.032
Sometimes,
in the teacher's lounge.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.634
- Heh-heh.
Ma'am.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.403
We've been waiting our entire
lives for this opportunity.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.772
We will not let you down.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.840
[dramatic music]

10:06.907 --> 10:08.909
- Then
let's start your training.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.744
- Yeah!
- Heh heh heh.

10:10.811 --> 10:15.315
* *

10:15.382 --> 10:16.684
- Beavis.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.252
The government is about to
train our schlongs.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.422
- For all mankind.
[snickers]

10:22.489 --> 10:27.227
[mechanical whirring]
- Whoa!

10:27.294 --> 10:31.064
- Hey, Butt-Head, what part
of sex does this train us for?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.066
- Uh...I think it's the part

10:33.133 --> 10:35.035
where your face hurts
or something.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.906
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's gonna be good, yeah.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.042
[[echanical whirring]
- Oohh, yeah.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.778
[smacking sound]
- Get it! Yeah, yeah!

10:44.845 --> 10:47.580
[snickering]

10:47.647 --> 10:49.683
[both groaning]

10:49.750 --> 10:52.419
- Does everybody who
scores have to do this?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.121
- Uhhh...probably.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.724
- Ugh.
- Damn it.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.225
[snickering]

10:58.291 --> 11:01.294
[mechanical whirring]
[snickering]

11:03.897 --> 11:05.866
- Not bad.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.968
[airplane engines revving]

11:08.035 --> 11:09.636
- Heh-heh. Heh.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.440
- Damn it, Beavis,
stop barfing or you're going to

11:13.506 --> 11:14.474
make me bar--

11:15.909 --> 11:17.945
[both groaning]

11:19.646 --> 11:21.314
- Uh...
- Yeah, boy.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.916
- Well, that concludes
your training.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.251
So what do you think?

11:24.317 --> 11:25.652
Are you ready to do it?

11:25.719 --> 11:27.955
- Yeah, I was ready before,
but now I know how

11:28.021 --> 11:29.957
to do it upside down,
or something.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.358
- Yeah.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.093
I'm ready to do it right now,
if you want.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.594
- That's what I like to hear.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.730
Now, go get yourselves
cleaned up.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.834
- Beavis, tomorrow, we are
going to score with that lady.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.036
[snickering]
- In outer space?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.772
- Wherever she wants it.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.975
Outer space, the back of a car,
I don't care.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.778
- Yeah, me neither.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.080
- Well?
What do you think?

11:53.146 --> 11:55.983
- I think NASA
has a couple new astronauts.

11:56.049 --> 12:02.856
[uplifting music]

12:02.923 --> 12:07.360
* *

12:07.427 --> 12:09.830
[crowd cheering]

12:09.897 --> 12:12.332
- Do you know how few people

12:12.399 --> 12:14.467
have done
what you're about to do?

12:14.534 --> 12:15.836
- Um. No.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.705
- Only 256 men and 49 women.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.841
- That's a little more
than I was hoping,

12:20.908 --> 12:22.075
but, you know, that's okay.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.044
- From 16 different countries,

12:24.111 --> 12:26.814
ranging in age from 28-77.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.549
- Jesus Christ!
We get it.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.119
- And that's not even counting
the Russian dog and the monkey.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.520
- Enough!
[nervous giggling]

12:33.586 --> 12:35.722
- Of course, there were some
who didn't make it.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.825
- We're not going
to be one of those, ma'am.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.960
I can assure you.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.161
- Yeah, we understand
the risks.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.363
- Mr. Beaven.
Mr. Boothroid.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.266
You're the youngest astronauts
ever on the space shuttle.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.668
What's this moment feel like?

12:48.735 --> 12:50.503
- Oh, hold on a second.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.405
I've got something
I want to say.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.807
Heh heh heh.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.009
Um, I just wanna say

12:56.076 --> 12:57.777
I've wanted to do this
my whole life,

12:57.845 --> 13:00.914
but I never thought
it would really happen,

13:00.981 --> 13:02.782
and I dreamed about it
every night

13:02.850 --> 13:04.617
and then--and then I'd wake up

13:04.684 --> 13:07.921
and feel ashamed and I'd
try to hide it from my mom.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.190
But today,
my dream will come true.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.658
- Heh heh heh.
- And, um,

13:11.724 --> 13:14.227
I just want to say
that makes me the luckiest man

13:14.294 --> 13:17.464
in the world.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.666
[applause]

13:19.732 --> 13:22.369
[crowd cheers]

13:23.070 --> 13:25.839
- Boi-oi-oi-oing!

13:25.906 --> 13:30.978
- 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

13:31.044 --> 13:32.846
- Counting sucks.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.714
- [snickers]

13:34.781 --> 13:38.251
- 2, 1, lift-off.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.721
- Fire! Fire! Fire!

13:41.788 --> 13:47.394
* *

13:47.460 --> 13:51.498
- Endeavor, you are a go
for orbital operations.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.034
[Beavis snickering]
- Damn it.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.835
- I think
the floor's not working.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.537
- How are you boys doing?

13:57.604 --> 14:00.607
- Well, Serena, um, do you wanna
like just do it right now?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.142
or I was thinking
maybe we could--

14:02.209 --> 14:03.510
- We don't need you

14:03.576 --> 14:04.912
until we dock with the Mir
in three hours.

14:04.978 --> 14:09.116
Until then, do you
wanna see something amazing?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.351
[clank, whoosh]

14:17.557 --> 14:21.194
Sunrise over Mother Earth.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.531
Incredible, isn't it?

14:24.597 --> 14:26.599
- Is it three hours yet?
[giggling]

14:26.666 --> 14:28.768
- This is the best view
on the whole ship.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.704
That's why they put the
controls for the telescope here.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.574
Don't mess with those,
unless you want to risk

14:34.641 --> 14:37.277
breaking a $2 billion
piece of equipment.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.914
- Now it's probably
three hours, right?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.449
[snickering]

14:42.515 --> 14:46.386
- Take it all in while you can.
Just think, all of life,

14:46.453 --> 14:47.955
everything we've ever known,

14:48.021 --> 14:51.458
is down there on that
beautiful blue marble.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.627
[uplifting violin music]

14:54.694 --> 14:58.798
* *

14:58.865 --> 15:01.468
- Ehh. The Earth sucks.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.171
Let's mess with those things.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.173
Heh heh heh.

15:06.239 --> 15:10.077
[mechanical whirring]

15:10.143 --> 15:13.513
[clanging]

15:16.016 --> 15:18.285
All I see is, like,
nighttime or something.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.587
- Let's point it at the sun.

15:20.653 --> 15:25.125
- Cool, yeah. Heh heh.
Maybe we'll see some fire.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.861
[dramatic chords]

15:28.928 --> 15:32.565
- Let's have a look here.
See what we can see.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.368
[sizzling sounds]
Aah!

15:35.435 --> 15:38.938
I saw something but,
like, it went away.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.774
- Try the other eye.
You've got two of them.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.111
- Oh yeah, yeah, heh.
Good idea.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.846
Look over here and--
aah!

15:46.913 --> 15:49.049
- Beavis, you can't do
anything right.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.817
Step aside.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.554
[Butt-Head screams distantly]

15:57.790 --> 15:59.459
[scream continues]

16:03.997 --> 16:07.667
[hissing]

16:07.734 --> 16:09.736
- Okay, boys.
It's go time.

16:09.802 --> 16:14.507
[boys snickering]

16:14.574 --> 16:18.145
- It's kinda dark.
- Let me help you there.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.147
It can be tough,
your first time in space.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.349
- Thank you, ma'am.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.650
- Are you ready to do it?

16:23.716 --> 16:24.917
- Yeah, but I thought
you wanted us

16:24.984 --> 16:26.353
to do the docking first.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.788
- Commence docking sequence.

16:28.855 --> 16:33.826
[heroic music]

16:33.893 --> 16:36.996
[snickering]

16:37.064 --> 16:42.235
* *

16:42.302 --> 16:44.871
- See? They're doing great.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.906
[console beeping]

16:46.973 --> 16:49.876
[dramatic music]

16:49.942 --> 16:51.911
* *

16:51.978 --> 16:53.113
[alarm beeping]

16:53.180 --> 16:54.914
Wait. What are you doing?

16:54.981 --> 16:56.616
What are they doing?

17:02.422 --> 17:03.956
- No, no, stop!
- No, no, no--

17:07.894 --> 17:09.396
[overlapping yelling]
Beavis: What's going on?

17:09.462 --> 17:10.630
[alarms beep]
- Whoa!

17:12.699 --> 17:14.401
[clank]
- Ow! Somebody hit us!

17:14.467 --> 17:17.637
[overlapping shouting]

17:17.704 --> 17:19.772
[fire alarm blaring]
- Fire!

17:19.839 --> 17:22.008
- Fire! Fire!

17:22.075 --> 17:24.277
Damn it,
I can't see it.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.915
Fire!

17:34.121 --> 17:35.722
[click]
- Endeavor.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.724
Endeavor,
can you hear me?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.296
- We copy, Houston.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.665
- Endeavor,
your situation is critical.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.201
You've lost 91% of your oxygen

17:48.268 --> 17:51.404
and 93% of the fuel
you need to return to Earth.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.972
The Mir has been damaged,

17:53.039 --> 17:55.608
causing an international
incident with Russia.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.077
We've missed our window
to observe the black hole

17:58.145 --> 18:01.581
which will next be this close
to Earth in 34 trillion years.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.316
Also...
[static]

18:07.019 --> 18:09.689
- And now we've lost
comms with Earth.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.023
- Uhh...

18:11.090 --> 18:12.625
well, if you're looking
for some good news,

18:12.692 --> 18:15.128
I can see again.
[snickering]

18:15.195 --> 18:16.996
- Yeah, we're ready
to try the docking now.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.566
- Looks like you guys
got in a wreck.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.668
- Heh-heh.
Yeah, what happened?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.636
- We're gonna
make it back to Earth.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.205
I promise you that.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.806
But here's the problem.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.575
I don't know how to say this,

18:28.641 --> 18:29.676
so I'm just
gonna get right to it.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.043
There are seven of us,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.480
and we only have enough
oxygen for five people

18:33.546 --> 18:34.981
to make it home alive.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.083
So we all have
a decision to make.

18:37.150 --> 18:41.854
Two people need to
sacrifice themselves.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.823
- Um, heh.
Now, look, um, heh.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.626
I-I think we're all thinking
the same thing here.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.295
Can we put the TV back on?

18:48.361 --> 18:51.631
- Yeah, but something cool this
time, 'cause that show sucked.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.634
- Yeah, yeah, really.
"You have no oxygen."

18:54.701 --> 18:56.403
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- No, we can't put

18:56.469 --> 18:58.171
the TV back on--
that was our last

18:58.238 --> 18:59.606
communication with Earth.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.674
- You know...
- Captain, if I can make

19:01.741 --> 19:03.810
a suggestion--
- Guys.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.078
I volunteer.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.481
- Captain, no.
- You can't be serious.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.517
- I'm the captain of this ship.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.685
It would be easy
to blame our predicament

19:12.752 --> 19:15.388
on the mistakes
of two absolute idiots.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.524
- Boy, I'm glad
you said it and not us.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.492
Heh-heh.
- Yeah, really.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.861
Where'd you find
these two dumbasses?

19:21.928 --> 19:25.632
- No, you!
I'm clearly talking about you.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.335
But I chose you
for this mission.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.836
And ultimately,

19:29.902 --> 19:32.705
the responsibility
lies with me.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.541
- I'll volunteer too.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.409
If this is the end,

19:36.476 --> 19:38.778
I wanna make it
count for something.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.981
- End.
[snickering]

19:42.048 --> 19:45.518
- I'm gonna put on my suit
and take one last spacewalk.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.955
It's how I always wanted to go.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.392
- Wait a minute,
where's she going?

19:52.459 --> 19:54.160
Is it time to score?
Heh heh heh.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.963
- Beavis, they put us
in this rocket thing

19:57.029 --> 20:00.199
for one reason:
to score with Serena.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.536
It's gonna be one
giant leap for our schlongs.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.239
- Yeah, for all mankind.
[both snickering]

20:06.306 --> 20:10.610
[sentimental music]

20:10.677 --> 20:11.844
- Uh, Serena?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.480
- What?

20:13.546 --> 20:16.649
- I-I just wanted to thank you
for choosing us for this honor.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.117
I know I'm not the first guy

20:18.184 --> 20:20.587
most people would pick,
but you did and...

20:20.653 --> 20:23.323
and I'll be thankful
for the rest of my life.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.791
[snickering] That's all.

20:24.857 --> 20:28.194
- Your actions this day
will not soon be forgotten.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.197
- Maybe I misjudged you two.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.799
Listen.

20:33.433 --> 20:37.437
This belonged to my grandmother.
She used to tell me,

20:37.504 --> 20:39.539
"Keep dreaming your dreams."
- Mm-hmm.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.874
- "One day,
they might just come true."

20:41.941 --> 20:44.444
- Ha.
- I want you to have it.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.912
- Okay. Heh.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.915
- Watch me through the window,
doing what I love.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.783
One last time.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.785
My dream's over...
- Uh-huh.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.222
- But I hope someday
your dream comes true.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.060
I've gotta go put on my suit.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.632
- Whoa, she wants us to watch
her change through the window.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.899
Heh heh heh heh.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.501
- Are you sure about that,
Butt-Head?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.737
- Of course, dumbass.
You heard her.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.271
She said watch me
through the window

21:12.339 --> 21:13.573
and your dreams will come true.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.074
- Oh yeah.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.510
- And she gave us this
bracelet to seal the deal.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.012
- Yeah.
[snickering]

21:21.914 --> 21:24.351
[whoosh]

21:24.417 --> 21:29.622
[snickering over transmitter]

21:29.689 --> 21:31.624
Oh, yeah. Heh.

21:31.691 --> 21:35.161
[soft, emotional music]

21:35.227 --> 21:42.034
* *

21:44.170 --> 21:46.873
[silent snickering]
- Are you shitting me?

21:48.808 --> 21:51.844
[dramatic chords]

21:51.911 --> 21:55.382
Okay. I've had enough
of these dickheads.

21:55.448 --> 21:58.551
[mechanical whirring]

22:02.522 --> 22:03.790
[whack]

22:03.856 --> 22:06.526
- Enjoy space.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.194
- Now that
I'm about to be captain,

22:08.260 --> 22:10.830
things are gonna be
a little different around here.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.865
First of all--oh.
Hello!

22:12.932 --> 22:15.635
- I have some extremely
distressing news to share.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.770
Specialist Beavis
and Specialist Butt-Head

22:17.837 --> 22:19.806
made the very brave
and noble decision

22:19.872 --> 22:21.974
to sacrifice themselves.

22:22.041 --> 22:25.745
- Oh, that's awful.
- What a tragedy.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.615
- So, no reason
for me to volunteer, then?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.383
Okay.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.119
Just so we're clear, then...
I un-volunteer.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.221
I did volunteer, you know.
For the record.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.723
You can tell people.

22:36.789 --> 22:41.594
[boys continue snickering]

22:41.661 --> 22:43.295
[thud]
- Aah!

22:43.362 --> 22:45.297
- Aah!
- Ohh--

22:45.364 --> 22:47.900
- Believe me,
I tried to talk them out of it.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.169
But they felt it was
the right thing to do,

22:50.236 --> 22:53.205
and they left the airlock
before I could stop them.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.742
- Oh, no--
- But while their tragically,

22:55.808 --> 22:58.144
brief lives may be over,

22:58.210 --> 23:00.947
they will live forever
in our memories.

23:01.013 --> 23:04.484
[snickering over radio]

23:04.551 --> 23:07.253
Yeah.
[snickering]

23:15.394 --> 23:18.130
- The elaborate dance
of seduction continues.

23:18.197 --> 23:21.233
- Yeah, she really knows
how to build the anticipation.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.536
You know what I'm saying?

23:23.603 --> 23:26.539
Whoa! Um, Butt-Head?

23:26.606 --> 23:27.907
What is that thing?

23:27.974 --> 23:31.243
It feels like sucking us in
or something.

23:31.310 --> 23:35.214
- Uh...it looks like
some kind of gigantic hole.

23:35.281 --> 23:39.218
And it's black.
Wait a minute, Beavis.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.053
I think I know what
kind of hole this is.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.789
- Really?

23:42.855 --> 23:44.223
- It's a butthole.
[snickers]

23:44.290 --> 23:46.959
- No, no, no.
No way. No thanks.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.295
I don't want to die
in a butthole!

23:49.361 --> 23:53.633
I have dreams about it
all the time--no! No way!

23:53.700 --> 23:55.602
- Settle down, Beavis.
- Uh-oh-ahh!

23:55.668 --> 23:58.404
[screams echo]

24:03.743 --> 24:06.813
- Aah!
- Aah!

24:14.420 --> 24:17.890
[eerie music]

24:17.957 --> 24:20.927
[both coughing]

24:24.430 --> 24:25.765
- Umm, Butt-Head.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.399
Where are we?

24:27.466 --> 24:32.572
- Uh...I don't know.
- Are we still in space?

24:32.639 --> 24:35.441
- Whoa, Beavis.
You're not gonna believe this.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.477
Look at that number,
up there on the billboard.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.779
- Let's see, um--heh.

24:39.846 --> 24:43.115
There's a two. And then,
um, some kind of circle.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.717
And I don't know what that is,

24:44.784 --> 24:46.085
I've never seen
one of those before.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.720
- No, dumbass.
Not that number.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.455
That one.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.123
69.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.160
[snickers]

24:54.226 --> 24:58.430
- Um, so anyway, um,
are we still in space, though?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.866
[snickers]

24:59.932 --> 25:04.136
- Whoa, Beavis.
Look, it's Serena.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.072
- Whoa!

25:06.138 --> 25:08.340
- I guess she like made
a big sign so we'd remember

25:08.407 --> 25:10.376
we're supposed
to score with her.

25:10.442 --> 25:11.678
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.546
You know, that's really
thoughtful of her,

25:13.613 --> 25:15.848
she's a really nice lady.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.817
- Well, let's go do her.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.953
[military drums]

25:21.020 --> 25:24.223
* *

25:24.290 --> 25:27.594
- The missing nuke is somewhere
here in the Caucasus Mountains.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.796
It is our nation's
highest priority to find it.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.898
- It's happened.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.100
- Excuse me.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.469
- We've detected
a major space-time breach

25:37.536 --> 25:38.838
in American airspace.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.673
- My God.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.541
- And something
came through it--

25:42.609 --> 25:44.210
two lifeforms.

25:44.276 --> 25:47.279
- Who could it be?
The Chinese...Russia?

25:47.346 --> 25:49.081
- Or aliens.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.684
- This is why
we needed that space telescope

25:51.751 --> 25:54.486
to observe the black hole
in '98--damn it!

25:54.553 --> 25:55.722
Whatever they are,

25:55.788 --> 25:57.790
we need to get down there
and find them.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.592
- And dissect them.

25:59.659 --> 26:02.995
- Get Alpha Team on the plane.
We're wheels up in five minutes.

26:03.062 --> 26:06.899
[dramatic music]

26:06.966 --> 26:10.302
[eerie music]

26:10.369 --> 26:13.472
* *

26:13.539 --> 26:14.974
- That's better.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.276
- You can't score
with these things on.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.848
- Greetings,
Beavis and Butt-Head.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.150
- We bring you a grave warning.

26:24.216 --> 26:28.520
- Uh...who are you
fart knockers?

26:28.587 --> 26:31.057
- We are you,
from what your primitive planet

26:31.123 --> 26:33.092
would call
an "alternate universe."

26:33.159 --> 26:35.461
- A what?
- An alternate universe.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.430
- Uh...a what?

26:38.497 --> 26:42.635
- Um, did you see the cartoon
Spider-Man movie, per chance?

26:42.702 --> 26:45.037
- Uh...no.
- Oh.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.606
That would have made
explaining it a lot easier.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.309
- Our names are unknowable
to your puny brains.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.411
But you may call us
Smart Beavis

26:52.478 --> 26:53.980
and Smart Butt-Head.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.682
- You see,
in infinite universes,

26:55.748 --> 26:58.250
there are infinite
iterations of every person.

26:58.317 --> 27:01.087
Every possible
version of you exists,

27:01.153 --> 27:04.356
and we are the most
intelligent versions.

27:04.423 --> 27:08.160
- Uh...did any of the other
versions ever score?

27:08.227 --> 27:09.628
- No.
[dramatic chord]

27:09.696 --> 27:12.431
No version of Beavis
and Butt-Head has ever scored.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.267
- That is true
in every reality.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.736
- Cool.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.637
We're gonna be the first ones.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.006
- Oh, yeah.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.407
- Humorous, quite humorous.
Yes.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.509
- Droll, very droll, yes.
Whimsical.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.378
- That is amusing, yes.
Quite jocular, yes.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.214
- Mirthful, yes.
[boys snickering]

27:28.280 --> 27:30.182
- Okay, that's enough
frivolity.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.684
When you went through
the black hole,

27:31.751 --> 27:33.853
you traveled through
a five-dimensional portal

27:33.920 --> 27:35.421
in space and time.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.689
- But in so doing,

27:36.756 --> 27:38.925
you damaged the delicate
structure of the cosmos.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.860
- Damage is cool.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.729
- And now,
both of our universes

27:42.795 --> 27:44.731
face total destruction.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.766
- And so we come to you
for help.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.234
- There's a space-time portal

27:48.300 --> 27:49.936
that will return you
to your time.

27:50.002 --> 27:53.405
- You must enter this portal
before it closes in two days,

27:53.472 --> 27:57.343
or everything you have ever
known will be gone forever.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.445
- The portal is located
on the highest point

27:59.511 --> 28:02.548
on your planet,
atop your "Mount Everest."

28:02.614 --> 28:04.250
- This is your quest.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.685
- You have exactly two days.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.254
May science be with you.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.923
- You said "mount,"
Smart Beavis.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.258
- Yes, their primitive language

28:12.324 --> 28:14.060
has two meanings
for that word, yes.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.227
- Humorous, quite jocular.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.496
- Very droll and whimsical,
yes, yes.

28:19.398 --> 28:22.068
- What did they say?
- Uhh. I don't know.

28:22.134 --> 28:25.671
I think they were like
British or something.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.573
Okay, now let's go score.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.141
[snickering]

28:30.142 --> 28:31.944
- Um, we're here for Serena.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.846
- She probably
told you about us.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.681
So if you can just like,
you know,

28:35.748 --> 28:37.683
tell her we're ready
to get down with it.

28:37.750 --> 28:38.951
Heh heh heh heh.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.987
- Okay,
so you want to volunteer?

28:41.053 --> 28:43.790
Maybe do some
canvassing for Serena?

28:43.856 --> 28:45.491
- Canvassing?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.393
We've never done this before,
so like,

28:47.459 --> 28:49.695
maybe just, you know,
the regular way.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.697
- I wanna volunteer my wiener.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.099
[snickering]

28:53.165 --> 28:55.101
- Why don't we
just step over here

28:55.167 --> 28:56.836
so we can get a picture
of you two.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.838
- Do we need to, like, take
our clothes off or something?

28:58.905 --> 28:59.972
- Yeah.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.607
- We're gonna score!

29:01.673 --> 29:02.775
[camera lens clicks]

29:02.842 --> 29:04.643
* *

29:04.710 --> 29:06.578
- Oh, these polls
are horseshit.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.881
Can you remind me
why I'm paying you

29:08.948 --> 29:10.549
to get me re-elected governor?

29:10.616 --> 29:13.685
- And me re-elected lieutenant
governor, which is also--

29:13.752 --> 29:15.554
- Well, Governor, our new
strategy is youth outreach.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.089
- Youth outreach.
- Our campaign teams

29:17.156 --> 29:18.390
have been recruiting
young volunteers

29:18.457 --> 29:19.725
to use for a new ad campaign.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.961
We brought some pictures
for you to look at.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.863
- Pictures, okay.
- No, no.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.597
Loser. Eww.

29:25.664 --> 29:27.666
No.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.569
[dramatic chords]

29:30.636 --> 29:32.538
Clear the room.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.309
- I'm assuming
you wanted me to stay,

29:37.376 --> 29:38.677
because I'm second in command.

29:38.744 --> 29:40.212
- Look at this.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.148
They look exactly
like those kids I killed

29:42.214 --> 29:43.715
on the mission in '98.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.751
- Wow.
They really do.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.254
But they can't be the same
kids--that's impossible.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.423
- It's them. I know it.

29:51.490 --> 29:55.828
I spent three weeks stranded
in space because of those two,

29:55.895 --> 29:57.629
certain I would die.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.598
Drinking my own urine.

29:59.665 --> 30:02.201
We had to eat
flight specialist Jung.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.270
- Yeah, I didn't actually
get to eat any--

30:04.336 --> 30:05.537
- And then 24 years

30:05.604 --> 30:07.406
haunted that I had killed
two people,

30:07.473 --> 30:09.675
that the world
would find out what I'd done.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.777
- Yes, sometimes I wish
I didn't know that

30:11.844 --> 30:13.880
because it sorta puts me
in a tricky position

30:13.946 --> 30:15.347
going-to-jail-wise.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.349
- They must have fallen
into the black hole somehow.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.886
Traveled through
an Einstein-Rosen wormhole.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.753
- That's amazing.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.422
I mean, we have to tell
the scientific community--

30:23.489 --> 30:25.892
- We have to kill them before
they tell everyone what I did.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.260
- Right kill them. Yep.
Mm-hmm, no, that's what I meant.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.495
That's yeah, okay, good.

30:29.561 --> 30:30.829
- I just hope
we're not too late.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.131
Get the helicopter.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.200
Tell them I'm gonna go
visit some sick--

30:34.266 --> 30:37.269
I don't know--
veterans or dogs.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.538
- Why wasn't she there,
Butt-Head?

30:39.605 --> 30:41.240
Why would she
put up a big picture

30:41.307 --> 30:43.209
of herself
and then not be there?

30:43.275 --> 30:45.811
- Uh...it's a little
game she's playing.

30:45.878 --> 30:48.047
She wants us to chase her.

30:48.114 --> 30:51.083
- Oh yeah.
Here we come.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.385
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.821
Please would you to take this?

30:55.888 --> 30:57.990
- Uh, take it?
- Yes.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.325
- Okay.

30:59.391 --> 31:04.196
- No, you hold like this
and look here.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.765
- Whoa.
Check it out, Beavis.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.735
That guy just gave us
a cool little TV.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.804
- Heh.
Do you have any bigger TVs?

31:12.871 --> 31:15.741
- Uh, this show sucks.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.744
It's like just these
fat people standing there.

31:18.810 --> 31:21.647
- I don't know, Butt-Head.
It's not that bad. Heh heh.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.149
- Is good?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.716
Should we back up?

31:24.783 --> 31:27.019
- Uh, Okay.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.521
- Like this
or more backing up?

31:29.588 --> 31:31.123
- Uh...

31:31.190 --> 31:33.059
We're trying to watch TV.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.295
- Like thi--ahh!

31:36.362 --> 31:40.532
[both snickering]

31:40.599 --> 31:42.068
- That was cool.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.403
- Yeah, it's like the show
really found itself, you know.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.273
Glad we stuck with it.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.845
- Uh, we want some nachos,
but we don't have any money.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.215
- So why don't you
just pay with your phone?

31:56.282 --> 31:58.617
- Uh...you mean this thing?

31:58.684 --> 32:01.220
- Here. I'll show you,
what's your password?

32:01.287 --> 32:03.956
- Ehh, password?

32:04.023 --> 32:06.792
- Your password is password.

32:06.858 --> 32:10.029
That's original.

32:10.496 --> 32:14.466
- Whoa, we just
paid for that with this?

32:14.533 --> 32:16.335
- Yeah, you can pay for
anything with your phone.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.737
- Whoa. Anything?

32:18.804 --> 32:21.540
- That's right.
Anything at all.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.476
- Beavis,
this changes everything.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.740
we've made a composite

they're definitely not human.

- Uh, send up 100
more orders of nachos.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.989

kicks ass and everything.

- I'm Siri. I'm here to help.

- It's Serena.
Hey Butt-Head.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.410
Butt-Head!
- Damn it, Beavis,

34:04.476 --> 34:06.678
I told you to shut up.

Do those nachos come with

34:16.688 --> 34:18.624
Good to talk to you. Yeah.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.793
So, um, I was wondering,
um, you know, like, um,

34:21.860 --> 34:24.163
when we're going
to score you know?

34:24.230 --> 34:27.399
- Notre Dame is losing
to Alabama 7 to 0.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.101
- Yeah, that's interesting.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.903
Um, so um, I know you
probably like Butt-Head more,

34:31.970 --> 34:34.540
but I was thinking--
- I don't understand Butt-Head.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.675
- Yeah, me neither.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.944
Like, he thinks he can
tell me what to do,

34:39.010 --> 34:41.580
and he's always trying
to kick my ass for no reason.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.282
And it just gets
old after a while.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.284
You know? I'm tired of it.

- How can I help you?

- Oh, just you know,
like, listening you know,

34:49.988 --> 34:51.590
helps a lot.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.225
I guess I never really had
anybody, you know, like to

I'm talking and stuff, you know?

- I don't understand Beavis.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.304
- You know,
neither do I sometimes.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.907
Yeah. Neither do I.

sometimes when I talk to you,

you know, I have this like
strange feeling.

and sad at the same time.

to search the web?

Yeah.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.768
Maybe we can search for some.
Yeah.

- A spider web is a structure
created by a spider

out of proteinaceous
spider silk.

- I don't understand butthole.
- Leave us alone!

are you talking to Serena?

35:52.551 --> 35:54.085
Unlock the door now!

35:54.152 --> 35:55.821
- I can't unlock the door.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.856
First you need
to set up the Home app.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.625
Would you like me
to help you set up your home?

35:59.691 --> 36:02.294
- Wait a minute.
You're in our home?

36:02.361 --> 36:05.264
- Would you like me
to help you set up your home?

36:05.331 --> 36:07.533
- Butt-Head,
she's at the house!

We need to go home
right now so we can score.

before sunset, Beavis.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.596
- We just missed them, sir.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.368
- They wanted us to find this.

[Geiger counter ticks]

36:45.437 --> 36:48.574
- Definitely not human.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.008
- They paid
for the room with a phone,

36:50.075 --> 36:52.511
so we were able to get
a recording of their voices.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.647
- Woodson.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.722
to approximate human speech.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.692
I'll know more when I dissect
their mouthparts.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.093
- We've got GPS

get to meet you.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.733
- And I'm the lieuten--

37:14.800 --> 37:17.202
- I'm just so interested
in all my young supporters,

37:17.269 --> 37:19.571
but particularly these two.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.440
- Oh, them.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.442
- Did they say
anything about me?

37:23.509 --> 37:25.777
Or tell you why they were here?

37:25.844 --> 37:28.146
- No.
Mostly they just laughed a lot.

37:28.213 --> 37:30.316
From the minute
I introduced myself.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.518
- Introduced yourself?

- I'm Richard Whack.

- Dick Whack.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.659
- Well, I've always gone by
Richard for that very rea--

- It really is them.
- Damm it.

roads leading out of town.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.833
Say it's--do people
still care about terrorism?

37:47.899 --> 37:50.201
- I do, Governor.
- Let's go with that.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.237
- And so does
the whole Whack family.

37:52.304 --> 37:55.273
- Um, Butt-Head, um,
I was wondering something, um...

37:55.341 --> 37:57.643
I had a conversation
with this chick one time.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.078
And so, um, I was wondering, um,

38:00.145 --> 38:03.248
how do you know when
you're like, in love?

did you just say, Beavis?

38:07.185 --> 38:09.120
- Uh, never mind, never mind.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.056
I'm just gonna take a whiz,
Butt-Head.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.024
I'll just go ahead
and get that from you.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.260
Be right back.

[phone chimes]
- I'm happy to be here.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.267
- It's good to hear your voice.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.702
- I can't change my voice.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.471
But you can do it
yourself in settings.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.873
- Oh, no, no, no,
I like your voice.

38:27.939 --> 38:31.142
I just want to say,
you know, like, um,

38:31.209 --> 38:33.379
we were eating some nachos,
you know?

38:33.445 --> 38:35.447
And I love nachos, you know?

38:35.514 --> 38:38.283
And then, um, and then I
was thinking about you and me.

38:38.350 --> 38:42.220
And I just want to say
that I also love, um,

38:42.287 --> 38:44.055
I mean--

38:44.122 --> 38:46.257
- I didn't get that.
Could you try again?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.326
- You know what I'm
talking about though, right?

38:48.394 --> 38:51.997
You know, it's a word
that starts with an L, I think,

38:52.063 --> 38:55.601
or something, I mean,
maybe you could say it first.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.168
I mean, you know,
if you want to.

38:57.235 --> 38:58.804
[snickers]

38:58.870 --> 39:01.239
- Sorry, I'm having trouble
connecting to the network.

39:01.306 --> 39:04.175
- Uh-huh. And? And?

39:04.242 --> 39:05.677
[banging on door]
- Damn it, Beavis.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.746
You better not be
talking to Serena in there.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.248
- No, no, I'm just
spanking my monkey.

39:10.315 --> 39:11.783
- You better be.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.885
- I don't understand
spanking my monkey.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.988
- Damn it, Beavis,
you lying son of a bitch.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.957
[grunting]

39:20.158 --> 39:23.161
- Anyway, Serena,
I was just gonna say,

39:23.228 --> 39:24.730
and I've never said this

39:24.796 --> 39:27.566
to any girl before but, um...

39:27.633 --> 39:30.268
I--I love--

39:31.970 --> 39:33.472
- Damn it!
- No, no, no.

39:33.539 --> 39:34.506
[splash]

39:34.573 --> 39:35.974
[echoes] No!

39:36.041 --> 39:38.009
- We just lost the phone signal.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.144
- Damn it!

39:39.210 --> 39:41.346
- You dumbass.

39:41.413 --> 39:44.683
Now get it before it
gets all covered with turds.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.620
- I don't see it, Butt-Head.
Maybe it's deeper in.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.489
If I can just get--

39:50.556 --> 39:53.091
[screams] Get me out of here!

39:53.158 --> 39:56.394
- Do you see it now?
- It stinks!

39:56.462 --> 39:58.930
- Damn it, Beavis, you
gotta really get down there.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.132
You're not even trying.
- Come on. Help me.

40:01.199 --> 40:04.636
- Uh, okay, Beavis,
I'll help you.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.572
Guess I have
to do everything myself.

40:06.638 --> 40:07.906
- Get me out of here now!

40:07.973 --> 40:10.876
- Come on, get in there,
you lazy son of a bitch.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.211
- There's turds down here!

40:13.278 --> 40:15.847
- I don't care about
your turds, Beavis.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.785
Now get down there.
We need that phone to score.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.087
- They must have known we were
tracking their phone and put it

40:22.153 --> 40:25.524
in some sort of signal
blocking device or Faraday cage.

40:25.591 --> 40:27.325
- They've studied
our tradecraft.

40:27.392 --> 40:28.860
They're good.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.763
- Aah! Turd!

40:31.830 --> 40:34.666
["On the Road Again" plays]

40:34.733 --> 40:39.204
[boys continue yelling,
grunting]

40:40.238 --> 40:42.007
- Damn it!

40:42.073 --> 40:43.509
- What's rolling around
down there?

40:43.575 --> 40:45.243
- Get me outta here!

40:45.310 --> 40:46.612
[continues yelling]

40:46.678 --> 40:47.879
There's turds down here.

40:47.946 --> 40:51.416
* *

40:51.483 --> 40:54.219
- [snoring]

40:54.285 --> 40:57.589
["On the Road Again"
continues]

40:57.656 --> 41:02.127
* *

41:02.193 --> 41:03.962
- * On the road again...*

41:04.029 --> 41:05.764
- Time to wake up, Beavis.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.499
- Ah! Ah! Where am I?

41:07.566 --> 41:11.302
Turds!

41:19.978 --> 41:22.347
If I can...[splashing]
I can see it--

41:22.413 --> 41:23.915
[grunts] I found it!

41:24.883 --> 41:26.952
Damn it, that's not a phone.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.420
- There it is, dumbass.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.057
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
I didn't see it there.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.059
- You're disgusting, Beavis.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.662
- Your trip to Woodson Street,
Highland

41:36.728 --> 41:38.964
will take 274 hours.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.967
- Whoa,
she's counting the hours.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.936
Let's get moving, Beavis.
[snickers]

41:45.003 --> 41:47.906
[dramatic music]

41:47.973 --> 41:50.676
- Sir, we've got
a lock on the phone again.

41:50.742 --> 41:54.746
- Change course to intercept.
- We won't lose them this time.

41:56.582 --> 41:59.517
- What is this?
Is this college or something?

41:59.585 --> 42:01.086
- It could be.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.521
Something sucks.
- Oh, boy. Heh heh.

42:03.589 --> 42:06.558
Let's get out of here before
we learn something, Butt-Head.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.194
- Yeah, really.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.962
[warbling sounds]

42:11.029 --> 42:13.298
- Beavis, Butt-Head, it is we.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.567
- We have made
the quest easier.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.468
We have moved the portal.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.738
- Mount Everest seemed like
a good idea at the time

42:19.805 --> 42:23.875
for its proximity to space,
but the trip was a long-y.

42:23.942 --> 42:26.311
- Are you those guys
that are like us

42:26.377 --> 42:27.579
or something?

42:27.646 --> 42:29.447
- We've covered this already.

42:29.514 --> 42:32.984
- The portal is now over there
behind the Classics building.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.953
- It is well hidden
there because no one

42:35.020 --> 42:37.122
cares about
the humanities anymore.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.324
- They want jobs that will
allow them to pay off

42:39.390 --> 42:40.926
their student debt.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.360
- Amusing, yes.
- Yes, humorous, yes.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.729
- Satirical comment
on the times.

42:43.795 --> 42:44.896
- Yes, amusing.

42:44.963 --> 42:47.198
- Seek the portal
before all is destroyed.

42:47.265 --> 42:49.234
- The lives
of billions depend on it.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.937
- Hurry, you haven't
but much time.

42:52.003 --> 42:54.706
- [snickers] He said butt munch.

42:54.773 --> 42:56.608
[both snicker]

42:56.675 --> 42:58.376
- I did not.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.145
But I can see how
it would it be quite

43:00.211 --> 43:02.380
humorous if I had--
- Yes, yes humorous.

43:02.447 --> 43:04.415
- Yes, yes,
they do sound similar.

43:04.482 --> 43:06.384
Amusing and incongruous.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.821
- Uh, I like those guys.

43:09.888 --> 43:12.390
- How'd they disappear, though?

43:12.457 --> 43:13.992
- Uh, who cares?

43:14.059 --> 43:16.361
Magic sucks.

43:18.730 --> 43:20.031
- Are you sure about this?

43:20.098 --> 43:22.033
Feels a little bit
like a wild goose chase.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.202
- Listen,
one of our dipshit college

43:24.269 --> 43:26.537
campaign volunteers had
some crazy story about how she

43:26.604 --> 43:28.539
saw two teenagers
coming out of the same

43:28.606 --> 43:30.041
Porta Potty laughing at nothing,

43:30.108 --> 43:32.110
and one of them was covered
in feces and nacho cheese.

43:32.177 --> 43:33.645
Who else could it be?

43:33.712 --> 43:34.813
- Well, when I was in college,

43:34.880 --> 43:36.648
I did some pretty crazy--

43:36.715 --> 43:38.383
- Here's the deal.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.119
If I don't kill those guys, I'm
going to be accused of murder.

43:41.186 --> 43:43.088
And if I'm gonna be
accused of murder,

43:43.154 --> 43:45.023
I might as well kill those guys.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.525
So we're going to find them.
- Mm-hmm.

43:48.827 --> 43:52.163
- Let's take
a shortcut through this thing.

43:52.230 --> 43:55.433
- While exaggerating
gender norms sometimes winds up

43:55.500 --> 43:58.503
subverting existing paradigms--
[door clangs loudly]

43:58.569 --> 44:00.071
- Don't mind us.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.240
- We just need to get
through here so we can score.

44:02.307 --> 44:05.376
- Yeah. There's a slut at
our house who's gonna like

44:05.443 --> 44:06.611
do it with us.

44:06.678 --> 44:09.214
Any of you ladies
want to join the party?

44:09.280 --> 44:12.217
[students chatter in disgust]

44:12.283 --> 44:14.886
- Hang on, everyone. Hang on.

44:14.953 --> 44:16.922
This is teachable, okay?

44:16.988 --> 44:18.523
Now, they use the word "slut"

44:18.589 --> 44:21.459
in a sex positive way,
which is a good thing.

44:21.526 --> 44:24.629
But other than that,
these two are a reminder

44:24.696 --> 44:28.233
that we still have a long,
hard road ahead of us.

44:28.299 --> 44:30.601
- [snickers]
Long, hard.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.170
[both snicker]

44:32.237 --> 44:34.605
- Yeah, like a wiener,
or a schlong.

44:34.672 --> 44:35.941
You know, get it? [snickers]

44:36.007 --> 44:37.575
- Uh-huh.

44:37.642 --> 44:40.378
Why don't we start by having
you two tell us what you thought

44:40.445 --> 44:43.014
of the reading
assignments for today?

44:43.081 --> 44:45.650
- Uh, we don't really
read stuff.

44:45.717 --> 44:48.286
- Of course not,
because you don't need to.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.588
Because Daddy's connections
got you into college

44:50.655 --> 44:52.924
and will get you
a job on Wall Street.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.126
- Uh, wait a minute.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.595
Do you know who my dad is?

44:57.662 --> 45:00.431
- I'm sure he's very powerful
and can have me fired.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.000
But I don't care.

45:02.067 --> 45:05.036
- Cool. My dad's powerful.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.504
- Oh, that's cool. Yeah.
[snickers]

45:06.571 --> 45:08.639
Because Butt-Head's mom
said he died of syphilis.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.041
Wow. [snickers]

45:10.108 --> 45:13.178
- This is a classic
example of white privilege.

45:13.244 --> 45:15.046
And you both have it.

45:15.113 --> 45:17.983
- Uh, what's that?

45:18.049 --> 45:19.751
- Anyone want to fill them in?

45:19.818 --> 45:21.219
- Yeah, I'll do it.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.221
Okay. So, white privilege

45:23.288 --> 45:24.823
is when white people,
particularly men,

45:24.890 --> 45:27.492
automatically assume they
can take whatever they want.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.060
- And they never have
to worry about

45:29.127 --> 45:30.561
getting stopped by the police.

45:30.628 --> 45:33.164
- And they have the inside
track for any job they--

45:33.231 --> 45:34.565
- I've got this one, Aisha.

45:34.632 --> 45:38.369
They have the inside track
for any job they want.

45:38.436 --> 45:40.839
- Exactly, Gage,
thank you for that.

45:40.906 --> 45:43.608
That's white privilege.

45:43.674 --> 45:45.811
- Whoa, and we have that?

45:45.877 --> 45:47.245
- You sure do.

45:47.312 --> 45:49.347
- I see.
- Whoa.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.249
I never realized this stuff.

45:51.316 --> 45:54.319
- Yeah, you've
really opened up my eyes.

45:54.385 --> 45:56.788
- Well, I'm glad we've
been able to enlighten you.

45:56.855 --> 45:59.490
The real question is,
do you think you'll

45:59.557 --> 46:03.428
be acting
differently from now on?

46:03.494 --> 46:06.031
- I guarantee it.
- Yeah, me too.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.299
[bang!]
- Step aside, please.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.734
We have white privilege.

46:09.801 --> 46:12.137
- Yeah, yeah, check it out.

46:14.072 --> 46:15.673
Don't worry, it's okay.

46:15.740 --> 46:18.309
We automatically assume
we can take what we want

46:18.376 --> 46:21.179
and we don't have
to worry about the police.

46:21.246 --> 46:23.681
It's okay, you didn't know.
We didn't either.

46:23.748 --> 46:26.051
Good stuff.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.486
- This is what
we were taught, sir.

46:28.553 --> 46:31.456
- We're subverting
the existing paradigm.

46:32.991 --> 46:36.061
[alarm blares]

46:36.127 --> 46:37.963
- This rules.

46:38.029 --> 46:39.764
[snickering]

46:39.831 --> 46:42.901
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm glad we went to college.

46:42.968 --> 46:46.371
- Now I have the skills
for today's workplace.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.341
- Well, let's see.
What should we take next?

46:50.408 --> 46:53.111
Let's take that car.

46:53.178 --> 46:55.513
- But that's a police car.

46:55.580 --> 46:57.916
- Beavis, you dumbass.
Didn't you hear?

46:57.983 --> 47:00.451
We don't have to worry about
getting stopped by the police.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.053
- Oh, yeah.
[snickers]

47:02.120 --> 47:05.223
- Okay, Beavis, let's tear ass.

47:05.290 --> 47:08.894
[tires squeal]

47:08.960 --> 47:11.897
[snickering] That was cool.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.598
- Don't move!

47:13.664 --> 47:15.800
- Uh, sir,
maybe you didn't know,

47:15.867 --> 47:17.435
but we have white privilege.

47:17.502 --> 47:19.404
- Get your hands
where I can see them.

47:19.470 --> 47:22.373
- I think the problem
is you're just uneducated.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.775
- Yeah, we're gonna
get jobs on Wall Street.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.477
You guys know where that is?

47:26.544 --> 47:28.779
Cut it out!
Our dads are powerful.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.281
They did not die of syphilis.

47:30.348 --> 47:33.018
- Hey, Beavis was driving.

47:33.084 --> 47:34.920
[buzzer]
[metallic clang]

47:34.986 --> 47:36.287
We're in jail, Beavis.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.523
This kicks ass.

47:38.589 --> 47:40.791
- Yeah, that youth pastor
always said

47:40.858 --> 47:43.094
we'd be here someday.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.362
We finally made it.

47:44.429 --> 47:48.066
- The system works, Beavis.

47:48.133 --> 47:50.401
So, uh, sir?

47:50.468 --> 47:52.270
How long do
we have to stay here?

47:52.337 --> 47:54.872
Like an hour?

47:54.940 --> 47:57.575
- We're on our way to go score.

47:57.642 --> 47:59.044
- Well, you got no one
to bail you out,

47:59.110 --> 48:00.811
so you'll be here until
your arraignment in a month.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.447
I'll come get you then.

48:02.513 --> 48:05.150
- What-- What? A month?
- That sucks.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.985
- No, no!

48:07.052 --> 48:10.121
Nooo!

48:12.357 --> 48:14.225
- They ditched the phone.

48:14.292 --> 48:16.761
They could be anywhere.

48:16.827 --> 48:18.863
- This is their work.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.700
They're toying with us.

48:24.502 --> 48:27.505
- It's the Feds.
They're on this too.

48:27.572 --> 48:30.708
How much do they know
about the murders I committed?

48:30.775 --> 48:32.410
- Oh--attempted.

48:32.477 --> 48:34.212
[chuckles] In--in a video game.

48:34.279 --> 48:36.547
Yeah, I--I wasn't there.

48:36.614 --> 48:39.985
- [snoring]

48:40.051 --> 48:43.254
- Ugh this sucks.
[snickers]

48:43.321 --> 48:45.056
- Damn it.

48:45.123 --> 48:46.224
Serena's gonna be
at our house,

48:46.291 --> 48:47.658
and we're not gonna be there.

48:47.725 --> 48:49.760
She's gonna think I don't care.

48:49.827 --> 48:52.297
- Heh heh heh. You care.

48:52.363 --> 48:54.165
- I do care.

48:54.232 --> 48:56.467
Sometimes, I think about her,

48:56.534 --> 48:59.004
and I don't even get a boner
but I feel good anyway.

48:59.070 --> 49:01.472
- Damn it, Beavis, shut up.
You're embarrassing me.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.774
If you don't get a boner
when you think about her,

49:03.841 --> 49:06.511
then you don't
know what love is.

49:06.577 --> 49:07.745
[buzzer]

49:07.812 --> 49:10.681
- McCabe. Inspection now.

49:10.748 --> 49:12.017
- Shit.

49:12.083 --> 49:14.519
Okay, listen up, kid.
You're gonna help me out.

49:14.585 --> 49:15.920
I can't let
them find these on me.

49:15.987 --> 49:17.722
So you're going to take 'em.

49:17.788 --> 49:18.889
- Whoa, heh.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.191
You want me
to take all of those?

49:20.258 --> 49:22.127
- Yes moron, take them now.

49:22.193 --> 49:24.595
- Okay okay.

49:24.662 --> 49:28.166
Tastes weird.
Kinda salty.

49:28.233 --> 49:29.734
- Hey, don't eat em!

49:29.800 --> 49:31.702
Hide 'em in your pants.
- Shut up!

49:31.769 --> 49:33.771
- McCabe!

49:37.842 --> 49:39.244
- Heh heh heh heh.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.146
This is gonna be cool.

49:41.212 --> 49:44.782
[Beavis growls]

49:44.849 --> 49:46.451
- Maybe you ought to check
on that kid.

49:46.517 --> 49:48.886
- You better shut up, McCabe.

49:50.455 --> 49:56.294
[Beavis growls]

49:56.361 --> 49:58.563
- Which one of you guys
does tattoos?

49:58.629 --> 50:00.631
- Hey, you better tell
your friend to chill, man.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.600
- Yeah, he's not really
my friend.

50:02.667 --> 50:05.002
He just, like, follows me
around all the time.

50:05.070 --> 50:06.304
- [maniacal gibberish]

50:06.371 --> 50:08.406
- I think I want to get
a tattoo of a butt

50:08.473 --> 50:10.575
right here on my forehead.
Heh heh heh.

50:13.044 --> 50:16.314
- [echoing] I am Cornholio!

50:16.381 --> 50:18.149
I need TP for my bunghole!

50:18.216 --> 50:20.151
[snickering]

50:20.218 --> 50:21.652
Do not make my bunghole angry.

50:21.719 --> 50:23.054
I demand TP!
- Hmm?

50:23.121 --> 50:24.322
- Give me all your TP!

50:24.389 --> 50:27.258
All your TP now!

50:27.325 --> 50:28.893
- Quit disrespecting me!

50:28.959 --> 50:30.428
- I will find your TP.

50:30.495 --> 50:31.929
- [grunting]
- I seek TP.

50:31.996 --> 50:34.165
[humming and snickering]

50:34.232 --> 50:35.900
Do not disrespect my bunghole.

50:35.966 --> 50:38.969
[snickering]

50:39.036 --> 50:40.838
[murmuring]

50:40.905 --> 50:44.809
[Beavis grumbling]

50:44.875 --> 50:46.977
I am Cornholio!

50:47.044 --> 50:48.379
I need TP for my bunghole.

50:48.446 --> 50:52.016
Heh-heh-heh.

50:52.083 --> 50:55.353
[grumbling incoherently]

50:55.420 --> 50:57.054
I demand TP, I demand TP!

50:57.122 --> 50:59.023
More TP!

50:59.090 --> 51:02.360
- Little dude's right,
we do need more TP.

51:02.427 --> 51:03.994
- More TP, more TP!
[inmates murmuring]

51:04.061 --> 51:05.096
I demand TP!

51:05.163 --> 51:06.697
- Yeah, we want more TP.

51:06.764 --> 51:08.199
- They never give us enough.

51:08.266 --> 51:10.201
- You will not disrespect
my bunghole!

51:10.268 --> 51:12.837
- Yeah, they're
disrespecting us.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.872
They're disrespecting
our bungholes.

51:14.939 --> 51:18.243
[inmates murmuring]

51:18.309 --> 51:20.745
- [grunts]
We demand TP!

51:20.811 --> 51:23.481
- That little guy's right
about the toilet paper.

51:23.548 --> 51:25.316
- No man can see
his own bunghole.

51:25.383 --> 51:27.518
Hm-hm-hm-hm-heh.

51:27.585 --> 51:30.221
- One butt cheek here,
and then one here.

51:30.288 --> 51:31.422
Heh-heh.

51:31.489 --> 51:32.557
- Look, are you sure
you don't want

51:32.623 --> 51:34.592
a pair of dice or something?

51:34.659 --> 51:36.294
- Dice?
Heh-heh-heh.

51:36.361 --> 51:39.930
This is gonna be on my head for
the rest of my life, dumbass.

51:39.997 --> 51:41.266
- [chanting] TP! TP!

51:41.332 --> 51:44.269
- You cannot imprison
the almighty bunghole!

51:44.335 --> 51:45.970
And now, you must pay!

51:46.036 --> 51:47.305
Hm-heh-heh.

51:47.372 --> 51:49.174
- What the hell?

51:49.240 --> 51:50.575
- I don't get it, sir.

51:50.641 --> 51:53.178
It started out as a simple
request for toilet paper,

51:53.244 --> 51:55.146
but now it's out of control.

51:55.213 --> 51:58.683
- You have nothing to lose
but your bunghole!

51:58.749 --> 52:00.418
- Prepare the extraction team.

52:00.485 --> 52:02.253
- Who is this guy?

52:02.320 --> 52:03.754
Antifa?

52:03.821 --> 52:05.055
MS-13?

52:05.122 --> 52:07.392
- We ran him and his
associate's fingerprints,

52:07.458 --> 52:10.995
and it came back
that they died in 1998.

52:11.061 --> 52:12.297
- What the hell?

52:12.363 --> 52:15.166
[alarm blaring]

52:15.233 --> 52:17.968
[guards shouting]

52:20.905 --> 52:24.375
- No man is free while one
bunghole is in chains!

52:24.442 --> 52:27.178
- They died in '98?

52:27.245 --> 52:30.748
We're dealing with something
here that's beyond explanation.

52:30.815 --> 52:34.151
Have you ever seen a show
called "Touched by an Angel"?

52:34.219 --> 52:35.553
- No.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.323
- They always come
with a message.

52:38.389 --> 52:40.024
What could his be?

52:40.090 --> 52:41.492
- I am Cornholio!

52:41.559 --> 52:43.228
I need TP for my bunghole!

52:43.294 --> 52:46.564
- [chanting] TP! TP! TP!

52:46.631 --> 52:49.800
- Stand by to
take down Cornholio.

52:49.867 --> 52:52.303
- Have you seen my bunghole?
Heh-heh.

52:52.370 --> 52:55.940
- When I open this door,
unleash hell.

52:56.006 --> 52:58.343
[dramatic music]

52:58.409 --> 53:00.745
- Stand down.

53:00.811 --> 53:03.248
This has turned
into something bigger.

53:03.314 --> 53:06.851
Cornholio's their hero.

53:06.917 --> 53:11.021
He did the most dangerous thing
you can do in this place.

53:11.088 --> 53:13.624
[inspirational music]
He gave those men hope.

53:13.691 --> 53:16.193
And there's a funny thing
about hope.

53:16.261 --> 53:18.363
It's contagious.

53:18.429 --> 53:20.898
And these days, well,

53:20.965 --> 53:24.469
I think we need all the hope
we can get.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.804
- I hope you can
see my bunghole.

53:26.871 --> 53:28.573
- So what are we
supposed to do?

53:28.639 --> 53:31.609
- The only thing we can do.

53:31.676 --> 53:36.080
Give those prisoners
all the toilet paper we got.

53:36.146 --> 53:37.915
And then we're going
to put those two boys

53:37.982 --> 53:40.285
on a bus back
to where they came from.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.919
Destroy their records.

53:41.986 --> 53:46.123
And as far as I'm concerned,
they were never here.

53:46.190 --> 53:47.958
And with God's help,

53:48.025 --> 53:51.396
we will learn
from Cornholio's message today,

53:51.462 --> 53:53.564
and we will become better men.

53:53.631 --> 53:55.566
* *

53:55.633 --> 53:57.735
- I have but one bunghole
to give.

53:57.802 --> 54:00.505
Heh-heh-heh,
and I give it to you.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.540
[siren blaring]

54:02.607 --> 54:04.642
[truck horns honking]

54:07.912 --> 54:11.416
[cheers and applause]

54:11.482 --> 54:17.988
* *

54:24.094 --> 54:25.796
[ominous music]

54:25.863 --> 54:27.565
- National security?

54:27.632 --> 54:29.800
Well, that sounds important.

54:29.867 --> 54:32.236
But those two boys
were never here.

54:32.303 --> 54:36.941
Nope, no record of them
at this facility.

54:37.007 --> 54:40.044
- No jail is going to hold
those two for long.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.612
And apparently
they have the ability

54:41.679 --> 54:45.249
to wipe people's memories.

54:45.316 --> 54:49.086
- And to that end, I'm here to
surprise pardon two criminals

54:49.153 --> 54:53.324
as part of my new
"Soft on Crime" initiative.

54:53.391 --> 54:55.493
And I'll just take them back

54:55.560 --> 54:57.962
to the Capitol with me
in my car.

54:58.028 --> 54:59.730
- We heard about two
youngsters arrested

54:59.797 --> 55:03.300
over at TSU
for some minor offenses.

55:04.068 --> 55:07.605
- No, no one fitting that
description was ever here.

55:07.672 --> 55:09.273
- Really?

55:09.340 --> 55:11.576
Are--are you sure about that?

55:11.642 --> 55:13.243
- Absolutely.

55:13.310 --> 55:17.014
So, who do you want
to surprise pardon?

55:17.081 --> 55:18.583
- Uh...

55:18.649 --> 55:21.552
[engine rumbling]

55:21.619 --> 55:25.055
- Ma'am, we just want to say
thank you for pardoning us.

55:25.122 --> 55:26.857
We appreciate--
- Shut up.

55:26.924 --> 55:29.460
Where the hell are
Beavis and Butt-Head?

55:29.527 --> 55:31.028
- Oh, those guys?

55:31.095 --> 55:33.531
Oh, the warden put them on
a bus back to their hometown.

55:33.598 --> 55:35.933
Highland Texas, I think it was.

55:36.000 --> 55:36.767
- Oh.

55:36.834 --> 55:38.869
- Highland Texas.

55:38.936 --> 55:41.806
Finally a stroke of good luck.

55:41.872 --> 55:44.308
[tires screeching]
- Whoo-hoo!

55:44.375 --> 55:46.677
Thank you, Governor!

55:50.515 --> 55:54.151
- You know, I guess the lesson
to learn from this is,

55:54.218 --> 55:56.787
you probably should have
pardoned someone smaller,

55:56.854 --> 55:59.390
because--
- God damn it!

55:59.457 --> 56:01.492

right, Butt-Head?

Heh heh heh.

56:13.237 --> 56:14.705
- We sure are, Beavis.

It's been a long journey.

56:16.140 --> 56:18.042
Heh-heh.

56:18.108 --> 56:21.311
- Um, Butt-Head?
- Uh, yeah?

56:21.378 --> 56:23.247
- What do you think's gonna
happen when we score?

56:23.313 --> 56:24.649
Heh-heh-heh.

56:24.715 --> 56:27.017

is gonna be different.

Heh-heh.

- You just scored with me.

56:39.063 --> 56:40.598
- I did?

- Yes, and now I'm

Heh-heh, yeah!

56:51.241 --> 56:52.677
Oh!
- Whoa!

fire is cool.

- Ow!

Yes!

Beavis, from now on, it's
just gonna be you and me.

57:25.676 --> 57:26.677
And Butt-Head.

[sensual club music]

57:42.392 --> 57:43.861
- Hey Butt-Head, I heard

57:43.928 --> 57:45.863
you put your thingy
in a girl's thingy.

57:45.930 --> 57:47.732
- I sure did, heh-heh.

57:47.798 --> 57:48.733
- Did it hurt?

57:48.799 --> 57:50.835
- Nope, heh-heh.

57:50.901 --> 57:52.436
And I was never worried
that it would.

57:52.503 --> 57:53.604
Heh-heh.

57:53.671 --> 57:55.039
Wood.

57:55.105 --> 57:58.275
- Oh, Butt-Head, would you
please score with us?

57:58.342 --> 58:00.444
- And every other girl
you know?

58:00.511 --> 58:01.512
[giggling]

58:01.579 --> 58:02.547
- Indeed.

Heh-heh-heh-heh.

Heh-heh-heh-heh.

[dreamy harp]
Heh-heh-heh-heh, heh-heh-heh.

[quiet music]

58:12.690 --> 58:13.824
- Beavis.

58:13.891 --> 58:16.160
Beavis, wake up.
We made it.

58:16.226 --> 58:17.628
- Yeah, yeah, heh.
- Heh-heh.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.864
Yeah, we're gonna score, yeah.

Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- This is gonna be cool.

58:22.032 --> 58:24.434
Heh-heh.
- Heh, hm-hm-hm-heh.

58:24.501 --> 58:25.836
- Uh, Serena?

58:25.903 --> 58:28.105
Heh-heh.
- Serena?

58:28.172 --> 58:30.841
- Um, Butt-Head,
what are all these people

58:30.908 --> 58:32.142
doing in our house?

58:32.209 --> 58:34.612
- Uh, are we having
a party or something?

58:34.679 --> 58:36.013
- Better not be.

58:36.080 --> 58:38.182
We have to have sex in here.
- Heh-heh-heh.

58:38.248 --> 58:41.085
- Welcome, Anita Ross,
Castle Realty.

58:41.151 --> 58:42.486
Are you interested in the home?

58:42.553 --> 58:44.755
- Uh, this is our house.

58:44.822 --> 58:46.691
- Oh, yeah,
I fell in love with it too.

58:46.757 --> 58:48.092
Let me give you the tour.

58:48.158 --> 58:50.961
- Uh, what did you do
to our house?

58:51.028 --> 58:52.897
- Well, the current owner
bought the property to flip.

58:52.963 --> 58:54.899
Complete renovation.
[chuckles]

58:54.965 --> 58:56.934
- Yeah, this sucks, hm-hm-heh.

58:57.001 --> 58:59.269
- The house was empty
for a long time.

58:59.336 --> 59:01.305
Because it belonged to the
mother of one of these

59:01.371 --> 59:05.042
two teenagers who died in this
accident on the space shuttle.

59:05.109 --> 59:06.577
[whispering]
Shirley Beavis.

59:06.644 --> 59:07.878
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, heh.

59:07.945 --> 59:09.814
Whoa, Butt-Head, look,
a garbage disposal.

59:09.880 --> 59:11.649
- Yeah, heh, kick ass.
- Cool.

59:11.716 --> 59:12.917
- Yeah, it's all brand-new.

59:12.983 --> 59:14.952
Anyway, you won't believe
what happened

59:15.019 --> 59:17.454
to Shirley Beavis when
her son died in space.

59:17.521 --> 59:19.790
She went totally--
[garbage disposal whirs]

59:19.857 --> 59:24.695
[inaudible under disposal]

59:24.762 --> 59:26.330
[disposal stops]
And then, after she blew

59:26.396 --> 59:28.232
through the settlement money,
she did something

59:28.298 --> 59:29.867
you wouldn't believe.
- Something bigger, yeah.

59:29.934 --> 59:31.736
- She took--
[garbage disposal whirs]

59:31.802 --> 59:36.173
[indiscernible]

59:36.240 --> 59:38.042
Bittersweet thing she said is,

59:38.108 --> 59:40.711
if she could just see her son
one more time,

59:40.778 --> 59:43.547
she would tell him these words:

59:43.614 --> 59:45.282
"Son,"--
[garbage disposal whirs]

59:45.349 --> 59:48.218
[indiscernible]
- Yeah, grind it, yeah!

59:48.886 --> 59:50.587
[grinding and squelching]
[screams]

59:50.655 --> 59:52.122
- That kicks ass.

59:52.189 --> 59:53.958
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Ow, heh-heh, yeah.

59:54.024 --> 59:56.093
Yeah, yeah, cool, heh-heh-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.228
So, um, so where's Serena?

59:58.295 --> 1:00:00.665
- Who?
- Serena, yeah, heh.

1:00:00.731 --> 1:00:02.733
Siri for short.
- Siri?

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:04.134
- Is she
in the bedroom already?

1:00:04.201 --> 1:00:05.703
- I mean if there's like,
a line,

1:00:05.770 --> 1:00:08.105
that's cool and everything,
but, uh, we were led

1:00:08.172 --> 1:00:10.074
to believe we would
get first dibs.

1:00:10.140 --> 1:00:11.541
- Shut up, Butt-Head, come on.

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:14.044
- There's no smart home system,
if that's what you mean.

1:00:14.111 --> 1:00:16.013
There's no Siri here.

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:17.581
- She's not here?

1:00:17.648 --> 1:00:20.384
But--but she said--she said
she'd be here.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:22.619
Hm-hm-hm-heh.

1:00:22.687 --> 1:00:24.421
She's never lied to us before.

1:00:24.488 --> 1:00:26.456
[somber music]

1:00:26.523 --> 1:00:28.025
What happened, Butt-Head?

1:00:28.092 --> 1:00:29.694
She promised
she was gonna be here.

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:31.095
And now she's not.

1:00:31.161 --> 1:00:32.963
I thought we had something.

1:00:33.030 --> 1:00:34.531
Where is she?
- Damn it, Beavis,

1:00:34.598 --> 1:00:36.100
how am I supposed to know?

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:38.535
Uh, where's the remote?

1:00:38.602 --> 1:00:40.437
Heh-heh.

1:00:40.504 --> 1:00:42.840
- What are these things?

1:00:42.907 --> 1:00:44.041
- Ahh!
- Ugh!

1:00:44.108 --> 1:00:45.175
[dramatic chord]

1:00:45.242 --> 1:00:46.744
What the hell is that?

1:00:46.811 --> 1:00:49.179
- Yeah, where's the TV?

1:00:49.246 --> 1:00:51.949
- Uh, they're books.

1:00:52.016 --> 1:00:53.617
- What?
- Heh-heh.

1:00:53.684 --> 1:00:54.618
- Books?

1:00:54.685 --> 1:00:55.619
Books?

1:00:55.686 --> 1:00:57.087
No, heh, no!

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:58.455
We were supposed to score!

1:00:58.522 --> 1:01:00.457
It was gonna be the best thing
in the world.

1:01:00.524 --> 1:01:02.592
And instead,
all we get is books!

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.594
The worst thing in the world.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.096
I'm tired of this crap.

1:01:06.163 --> 1:01:07.431
It's not fair.

1:01:07.497 --> 1:01:09.499
- Damn it, Beavis,
this is all your fault.

1:01:09.566 --> 1:01:11.802
I would have scored if you
hadn't scared her off

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:14.071
with all your wuss
feelings talk.

1:01:14.138 --> 1:01:15.940
"Oh, Serena,
oh, I don't have a boner."

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:17.141
Bleugh!

1:01:17.207 --> 1:01:18.142
- Shut up, Butt-Head.

1:01:18.208 --> 1:01:19.343
I don't sound like that.

1:01:19.409 --> 1:01:21.078
You're the one
who scared her off.

1:01:21.145 --> 1:01:23.047
You're always
calling her a slut.

1:01:23.113 --> 1:01:25.015
- That's because
she is a slut, Beavis.

1:01:25.082 --> 1:01:26.416
[dramatic chord]

1:01:26.483 --> 1:01:27.952
She's an S-L,

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:31.188
uh, O or something slut.

1:01:31.255 --> 1:01:33.157
She told us herself, remember?

1:01:33.223 --> 1:01:37.728
256 men, 49 women, a dog,

1:01:37.795 --> 1:01:40.464

1:01:44.935 --> 1:01:48.005
Beavis, you've just
crossed a line.

1:01:48.072 --> 1:01:51.175
And I think we both know
what needs to happen now.

1:01:51.241 --> 1:01:52.676
- Ah! Butthole!

1:01:52.743 --> 1:01:54.344
- Heh-heh.
- [grunting]

1:01:54.411 --> 1:01:55.612
- [yells]
- Butt-Head, I'm gonna kill you,

1:01:55.679 --> 1:01:56.747
you son of a bitch!

1:01:56.814 --> 1:01:59.016
[grunting]
- Oh, my.

1:01:59.083 --> 1:02:01.251
I know this can be an
emotional decision

1:02:01.318 --> 1:02:02.686
for a couple, but...
- Beavis, you son of a whore.

1:02:02.753 --> 1:02:04.554
- Yeah, all right, here we go,
here we go, let's just--

1:02:04.621 --> 1:02:06.390
yeah, let's just move this
party outside.

1:02:06.456 --> 1:02:07.992
- Get your hands
off me, bunghole!

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:09.994
- Okay, just go, go, go, go,
go, good, good, good, good.

1:02:10.060 --> 1:02:11.695
- [grunts]

1:02:11.762 --> 1:02:14.865
- My email's on the flyer.

1:02:14.932 --> 1:02:16.166
- Damn it, Butt-Head.

1:02:16.233 --> 1:02:18.002
I finally found someone,
and you're jealous!

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:21.671
- "I have feelings, Serena,
wuh-heh-heh, let's hold hands.

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:23.507
"Wuh-heh-heh."
- Shut up, Butt-Head!

1:02:23.573 --> 1:02:25.042
You're the one
who drove her away.

1:02:25.109 --> 1:02:26.610
She said she doesn't
understand you,

1:02:26.676 --> 1:02:29.780
and we talked about spider webs
and you ruined everything.

1:02:29.847 --> 1:02:31.448
- Damn it, Beavis,
Serena never liked you,

1:02:31.515 --> 1:02:33.483
she was just talking
to you to get to me.

1:02:33.550 --> 1:02:36.286
I'm tired
of you weighing me down.

1:02:36.353 --> 1:02:38.688
I'm gonna get out of here,
and don't follow me.

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:39.723
Heh-heh-heh.

1:02:39.790 --> 1:02:41.558
- Well, don't follow me.

- Are you here because you
hate the United States?

- Um, heh, the United States?

1:04:03.407 --> 1:04:07.277
Is that, like, part of America
or something?

1:04:07.344 --> 1:04:08.913

share one brain.

Apart, they're barely able
to feed themselves.

1:04:16.420 --> 1:04:18.255
But together, their intelligence

1:04:18.322 --> 1:04:20.824

even conceive.

them together,

1:04:29.666 --> 1:04:32.903
we'll never know their plans
for world conquest.

Butthole, hm-hm-heh.

1:05:15.845 --> 1:05:18.848
- As long as you're in the
state of Texas, Special Agent,

1:05:18.915 --> 1:05:20.617
both those boys belong to me.

1:05:20.684 --> 1:05:23.487
- And to a lesser extent me,
because I'm the lieutenant--

1:05:23.553 --> 1:05:25.389
- There's no ice in this.

1:05:25.455 --> 1:05:27.691
- Could your assistant get me
some ice as well?

1:05:27.757 --> 1:05:30.294
- Oh, I'm not actually her
assistant, I'm the lieutenant--

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.129

It's not that funny,
hm-hm-hm-heh.

1:05:47.544 --> 1:05:50.447
- Federal law dictates
that you turn them over.

Yeah, so what?
It's not that funny, Butt-Head.

1:05:59.389 --> 1:06:00.824
So one word sounds
like another word,

1:06:00.890 --> 1:06:02.326
big deal, who cares?

1:06:02.392 --> 1:06:05.062
- So you can ruin me and have
me replaced as governor

1:06:05.129 --> 1:06:06.963
with one of your
deep state assets?

1:06:07.031 --> 1:06:09.333
- She said ate ass.

1:06:09.399 --> 1:06:12.169
Heh-heh-heh.
- Whoa, ate ass.

1:06:12.236 --> 1:06:13.470
She said ate ass!

1:06:13.537 --> 1:06:14.771
- Jesus, what is wrong
with you?

1:06:14.838 --> 1:06:16.306
I did not say ate ass.

1:06:16.373 --> 1:06:18.275
- She said it again, hm-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.

1:06:18.342 --> 1:06:19.709
- Ate ass.

1:06:19.776 --> 1:06:22.146
- They're just sitting around
saying ate ass.

1:06:22.212 --> 1:06:24.448
- Ate ass.
- Ate ass.

1:06:24.514 --> 1:06:26.450
- They are really annoying.
- Ate ass, sir.

1:06:26.516 --> 1:06:28.018
- Is there another room
we could put them in?

1:06:28.085 --> 1:06:29.419
- Ate ass!

1:06:29.486 --> 1:06:31.821
- Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh, ate ass.

1:06:31.888 --> 1:06:33.523
Hm-hm-heh-heh-heh.
- Ate ass, heh-heh.

1:06:33.590 --> 1:06:35.559
- And then she said
she didn't say ate ass,

1:06:35.625 --> 1:06:37.094
which made her say it again.

1:06:37.161 --> 1:06:39.563
And then we said it, remember?

1:06:39.629 --> 1:06:41.665
Hm-hm-hm-heh-heh.
- Yeah, that was cool.

1:06:41.731 --> 1:06:43.233
- Oh, boy.
- Heh-heh-heh.

1:06:43.300 --> 1:06:44.868
- Quick,
I don't have much time.

1:06:44.934 --> 1:06:47.137
I know what Serena did to you
on the Endeavor.

1:06:47.204 --> 1:06:49.973
- Uh, she hasn't done it yet.

1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:51.641
- It's gonna be any minute
though, yeah.

1:06:51.708 --> 1:06:53.577
- I can help you
bring her down.

1:06:53.643 --> 1:06:57.281
- Uh, so like,
you'd be in the room?

1:06:57.347 --> 1:06:59.149
- I'll be right behind you
all the way.

1:06:59.216 --> 1:07:00.784
- Heh.
- Ugh.

1:07:00.850 --> 1:07:02.252
Really?
- I don't know, Butt-Head,

1:07:02.319 --> 1:07:03.653
I guess it's worth it, I mean,

1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:05.355
I wouldn't say no to anything
at this point.

1:07:05.422 --> 1:07:06.823
- Here's the plan.

1:07:06.890 --> 1:07:09.493
I left the keys in that
green car right down there.

1:07:09.559 --> 1:07:10.527
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1:07:10.594 --> 1:07:12.162
- Take the highway northbound

1:07:12.229 --> 1:07:13.497
to the Pecos county rest stop.

1:07:13.563 --> 1:07:14.664
- Mm-hmm, sounds good.

1:07:14.731 --> 1:07:16.533
- There's a reporter from
the morning news

1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:18.102
waiting to hear your story.

1:07:18.168 --> 1:07:19.469
- Okay.
- All right, uh-huh.

1:07:19.536 --> 1:07:21.971
- Did you get all that?
- Yes, sir, heh-heh.

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:23.573
- Yep, we're gonna score.

1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:26.176
Heh-heh-heh.
- Damn right.

1:07:26.243 --> 1:07:28.545
- I have to go back in there
before they get suspicious,

1:07:28.612 --> 1:07:30.247
but you've got to
get out of here, now.

1:07:30.314 --> 1:07:33.183
The people in there
want you dead.

1:07:33.250 --> 1:07:35.485
What she tried
to do to you in '98

1:07:35.552 --> 1:07:38.722
she's done to me every day
for 24 years.

1:07:38.788 --> 1:07:40.724
- Christ, heh-heh-heh.
- Whoa, heh-heh.

1:07:40.790 --> 1:07:42.058
- There's no need
to brag about it.

1:07:42.126 --> 1:07:44.027
- I'm going to make sure
she can't do it to you

1:07:44.094 --> 1:07:47.331
or anyone else ever again.

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:49.466
- Uh, wait a minute,

1:07:49.533 --> 1:07:51.401
I think I see
what's going on here.

1:07:51.468 --> 1:07:53.337
He doesn't want us to score.

1:07:53.403 --> 1:07:55.405
That's why he took
the handcuffs off.

1:07:55.472 --> 1:07:56.673
- Yeah, yeah, because he knows

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:58.308
Serena has a thing
for handcuffs.

1:07:58.375 --> 1:08:00.144
Yeah, hm-hm-heh.
- Exactly.

1:08:00.210 --> 1:08:01.645
And that's why he gave us a car,

1:08:01.711 --> 1:08:03.580
and directions
to someplace far away

1:08:03.647 --> 1:08:05.615
where Serena will never find us.

1:08:05.682 --> 1:08:07.817
That dirty butthole.

1:08:07.884 --> 1:08:08.752
- Damn it! Heh.

1:08:08.818 --> 1:08:10.053
What's wrong with that guy?

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:12.556
He's scored every day
for--for 24 years.

1:08:12.622 --> 1:08:14.758
That's like, um, 50 times.

1:08:14.824 --> 1:08:16.025
- We got to get back
in there

1:08:16.092 --> 1:08:18.495
and get those handcuffs
back on, Beavis.

1:08:18.562 --> 1:08:20.864
We just outsmarted
that son of a bitch.

1:08:20.930 --> 1:08:22.432
[tense music]

1:08:22.499 --> 1:08:24.100
Damn it, it's locked.

1:08:24.168 --> 1:08:26.069
- Quick, Butt-Head, the window.

1:08:26.136 --> 1:08:27.404
[grunts]

1:08:27.471 --> 1:08:28.438
- [grunts]

1:08:28.505 --> 1:08:29.939
- Ah!
- Ugh.

1:08:30.006 --> 1:08:32.542
Heh-heh.
- That was close, hm-hm-heh.

1:08:32.609 --> 1:08:34.411
I can't wait to see
the look on his face

1:08:34.478 --> 1:08:36.346
when he sees that car
and we're not in it.

1:08:36.413 --> 1:08:37.481
Heh-heh-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh.

1:08:37.547 --> 1:08:39.349
[laughter]

1:08:39.416 --> 1:08:41.251
- [chuckles]
What did I miss?

1:08:41.318 --> 1:08:42.486
- This is so funny.

1:08:42.552 --> 1:08:44.388
We were arguing
whether they're aliens

1:08:44.454 --> 1:08:45.922
or the boys
from the Space Shuttle.

1:08:45.989 --> 1:08:48.358
But then we realized,
it doesn't matter.

1:08:48.425 --> 1:08:50.059
We both want the same thing.

1:08:50.126 --> 1:08:53.497
- We want to kill them,
and they want to dissect them.

1:08:53.563 --> 1:08:55.265
We're all on the same team.

1:08:55.332 --> 1:08:57.367
[laughter]

1:08:57.434 --> 1:08:59.569
- Well, let's go kill them.

1:08:59.636 --> 1:09:02.038
- And dissect them,
right, Phil?

1:09:02.105 --> 1:09:03.240
- You got me.

1:09:03.307 --> 1:09:05.442
[chuckling]

1:09:05.509 --> 1:09:07.377
- What the hell?

1:09:07.444 --> 1:09:09.045
Uh, just hold on a second.

1:09:09.112 --> 1:09:10.747
- What is it, Hartson?

1:09:10.814 --> 1:09:12.949
- All this talk
about dissecting

1:09:13.016 --> 1:09:14.551
is making me curious.

1:09:14.618 --> 1:09:16.620
No, you know what, forget it,
it's probably way

1:09:16.686 --> 1:09:19.122
too complicated for someone
like me to understand.

1:09:19.189 --> 1:09:20.390
- Hmm.

1:09:20.457 --> 1:09:23.092
Oh, no, no, no, on the contrary,

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.494
this will just take a minute.

1:09:24.561 --> 1:09:26.396
I've got some pictures
on my phone.

1:09:26.463 --> 1:09:29.032
First, you need
to locate the anus.

1:09:29.098 --> 1:09:30.534
[cuffs jingling]

1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:32.469
- Okay, there,
we got 'em closed.

1:09:32.536 --> 1:09:35.505
Now let's put our hands in.

1:09:35.572 --> 1:09:37.040
- It won't fit, Butt-Head.

1:09:37.106 --> 1:09:39.576
How'd we ever get our hands
in here in the first place?

1:09:39.643 --> 1:09:43.012
- Uh, let's open them up
and start over again.

1:09:43.079 --> 1:09:44.514
We need a key, heh-heh.

1:09:44.581 --> 1:09:48.518
- I think that guy said the
keys are in the green car.

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:50.654
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Uh, oh, yeah.

1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:52.856
Heh-heh, good thinking, Beavis.

1:09:52.922 --> 1:09:54.324
Heh-heh-heh.
- Yeah, heh-heh, thanks.

1:09:54.391 --> 1:09:57.861
- I know you're thinking,
"I need an expensive scalpel,"

1:09:57.927 --> 1:10:00.430
but save your money
for the embalming fluid.

1:10:00.497 --> 1:10:02.499
There's a guy in Ecuador
who can set you up--

1:10:02.566 --> 1:10:04.200
- You know what,
we don't have time for this.

1:10:04.268 --> 1:10:06.836
Let's go kill those boys, huh?

1:10:06.903 --> 1:10:08.872
- Heh-heh.
[car alarm chimes]

1:10:08.938 --> 1:10:10.907
- Damn it.
- I think you just, um...

1:10:10.974 --> 1:10:13.076
- This key sucks.
- Yeah, I don't know.

1:10:26.590 --> 1:10:28.492
I can't believe it!

1:10:28.558 --> 1:10:30.059
- Where could they have gone?

1:10:30.126 --> 1:10:32.929
- I think I have an idea.

1:10:32.996 --> 1:10:37.434
- Directions to 322 Woodson
Street, Highland, Texas.

- Hartson, get in the van.

1:10:51.047 --> 1:10:52.449

And that butthole.
- [mouthing words]

1:10:58.054 --> 1:10:59.689
- He's gonna go
score with her.

1:10:59.756 --> 1:11:01.925
- Why is it always
a guy with a van?

1:11:01.991 --> 1:11:04.561
- We got to save her before
Hartson bones her again.

1:11:04.628 --> 1:11:06.730
Heh-heh.
- Yeah, he's out of control.

1:11:06.796 --> 1:11:09.132
And, um, I just want to say, um,

1:11:09.198 --> 1:11:11.100
you can score first
if you want to, Butt-Head.

1:11:11.167 --> 1:11:12.536
Hm-hm-heh.

1:11:12.602 --> 1:11:15.204

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:17.140
And you're not gonna score.

1:11:17.206 --> 1:11:18.274
We're gonna score.

before I change my mind.

Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Yeah!

1:11:27.584 --> 1:11:29.786
- All we need now
is a car.

1:11:29.853 --> 1:11:34.057
Hmm.
- Um, Butt-Head, we're in a car.

Yeah, hm-hm-hm-hm-heh.

Heh-heh, you're on a roll,
Beavis.

1:12:56.773 --> 1:12:58.141
Ow, heh, ow!
- Ugh!

1:12:58.207 --> 1:13:00.510
[smoke hissing]

1:13:00.577 --> 1:13:01.811
Ugh.
- [grunts]

1:13:01.878 --> 1:13:03.813
- You have a bag in your face.
- [coughs]

1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:06.550
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Oh, yeah, heh-heh.

1:13:06.616 --> 1:13:08.685
Bag, heh-heh-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.

1:13:08.752 --> 1:13:09.719
- Come on, Butt-Head!

1:13:09.786 --> 1:13:10.754
Come on, drive!

1:13:10.820 --> 1:13:12.556
We have to save Serena, come on.

1:13:12.622 --> 1:13:13.590

["Children Of The Grave"
continues]

1:13:17.461 --> 1:13:22.398
- * Children of tomorrow live
in the tears that fall today *

1:13:22.466 --> 1:13:24.000
- [yells]

* Bring in peace in any way? *

1:13:30.940 --> 1:13:32.442
- * Must the world live
in the shadow... *

1:13:32.509 --> 1:13:35.512
- Uh, I think there's
something wrong with this car.

1:13:35.579 --> 1:13:37.313
Heh-heh-heh.

1:13:37.380 --> 1:13:39.583
- The car is going
backwards, Butt-Head.

1:13:39.649 --> 1:13:41.417
Heh.
- Uh, oh.

1:13:41.485 --> 1:13:44.353
Heh-heh, cool.

1:13:44.420 --> 1:13:46.723
- Whew, well,
I think we lost them.

1:13:46.790 --> 1:13:48.324
Nothing to worry about, I guess.

1:13:48.391 --> 1:13:50.259
[dramatic chord]

1:13:50.326 --> 1:13:52.862
- They're back, and they're
driving backwards.

1:13:52.929 --> 1:13:54.430
- What the hell is happening?

1:13:54.498 --> 1:13:56.099
Who are these guys?

1:13:56.165 --> 1:13:58.735
- The East Germans train their
assassination teams

1:13:58.802 --> 1:14:00.470
to drive backwards
to give their snipers

1:14:00.537 --> 1:14:01.905
a better field of vision.

1:14:01.971 --> 1:14:04.107

1:14:04.173 --> 1:14:06.309
[crashing]

1:14:08.144 --> 1:14:09.445
- We almost got 'em,
Butt-Head, hurry.

1:14:09.513 --> 1:14:10.814
Heh-heh-hm-hm-heh.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:12.549
[eerie music]
[synthetic whooshing]

1:14:12.616 --> 1:14:14.017
- Beavis and Butt-Head.
- [yells]

1:14:14.083 --> 1:14:15.451
- Listen carefully.

1:14:15.519 --> 1:14:18.054
You only have three minutes
to go through the portal.

1:14:18.121 --> 1:14:19.789
Our universes
hang in the balance.

1:14:19.856 --> 1:14:23.059
- Uh, how did you get here?

1:14:23.126 --> 1:14:26.530
- Our universe has technology
that you can only dream of.

1:14:26.596 --> 1:14:28.064
- Can you watch porn on it?

1:14:28.131 --> 1:14:29.833
- Yes, an infinite amount.

1:14:29.899 --> 1:14:31.935
- Every scenario
you can ever imagine.

1:14:32.001 --> 1:14:33.269
- But none of it will exist

1:14:33.336 --> 1:14:34.904
if you do not go
through the portal.

1:14:34.971 --> 1:14:37.273
- Why did you not go
through the portal before?

1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:40.143
It was right there behind
the Classics department.

1:14:40.209 --> 1:14:42.746
- You could have saved the
universe and maybe learned

1:14:42.812 --> 1:14:44.981
how Latin is the basis
of English grammar.

1:14:45.048 --> 1:14:47.751
- But no matter.
At great personal expense,

1:14:47.817 --> 1:14:49.385
we have moved the portal again.

1:14:49.452 --> 1:14:51.254
It is now in your old home,

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.857
in the poorly renovated
half bathroom.

1:14:53.923 --> 1:14:56.626
- Enter now so the portal
might seal itself,

1:14:56.693 --> 1:14:58.227
and you will return
to a universe

1:14:58.294 --> 1:15:00.163
where you never went through
the black hole

1:15:00.229 --> 1:15:04.333
but instead lived your lives
these past 24 years.

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:05.434
[synthetic whirring]

1:15:05.501 --> 1:15:07.203
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Hm-hm-heh-heh.

1:15:07.270 --> 1:15:09.205
[coughs]
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.

1:15:09.272 --> 1:15:11.440
- Um, heh, who are those guys?

1:15:11.507 --> 1:15:13.643
- Uh, I don't know.

1:15:13.710 --> 1:15:15.078
They seem pretty cool, though.

1:15:15.144 --> 1:15:16.813
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
not too bad, really.

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.582
- This show sucks.

1:15:18.648 --> 1:15:20.016
- Yeah, yeah, it's horrible.

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:21.685
Change the channel, Butt-Head,
come on, right now.

1:15:21.751 --> 1:15:23.519
- Don't tell me what to do.

1:15:23.587 --> 1:15:24.754
[grunts]
- [yells]

1:15:24.821 --> 1:15:26.255
- Yeah, yeah, hit 'em,
hit 'em again.

1:15:26.322 --> 1:15:27.624
[whooshing]

1:15:27.691 --> 1:15:29.025
Come on, turn that show back on.

1:15:29.092 --> 1:15:30.093
- There is no time.

1:15:30.159 --> 1:15:31.995
Now fly to the portal, fly.

1:15:32.061 --> 1:15:33.296
[dramatic music]

1:15:33.362 --> 1:15:34.964
- There's a stop sign,
Butt-Head.

1:15:35.031 --> 1:15:36.132
- Fly, my friends--

1:15:36.199 --> 1:15:37.533
[yelling]

1:15:39.268 --> 1:15:41.771
- Heh, ow.

1:15:41.838 --> 1:15:44.273
[engine roaring] Ah!

1:15:44.340 --> 1:15:45.441
That was painful.

1:15:45.508 --> 1:15:48.344
- We must hasten to the--

1:15:48.411 --> 1:15:49.846
[urgent music]

1:15:49.913 --> 1:15:51.347
- Looks like we lost them.

1:15:51.414 --> 1:15:53.416
Woodson Street
is right up ahead.

1:15:53.482 --> 1:15:54.684

1:15:58.855 --> 1:16:02.759
[metal crashing]

1:16:02.826 --> 1:16:04.761
- There they are, Butt-Head.

1:16:04.828 --> 1:16:06.362
- Sweet Christ.

1:16:06.429 --> 1:16:08.164
- There's only five people
in the world

1:16:08.231 --> 1:16:09.198
who could drive like that.

1:16:09.265 --> 1:16:10.466
- Yeah, again, probably just

1:16:10.533 --> 1:16:11.835
someone going out shopping,
and their

1:16:11.901 --> 1:16:13.469
transmission got
stuck in reverse.

1:16:13.536 --> 1:16:15.138
Happens to me.
Never happened to you?

1:16:15.204 --> 1:16:17.373
- I'm not going down
without a fight.

1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:19.709
- Or instead,
you could pull over

1:16:19.776 --> 1:16:20.810
and let me out and-- [gunfire]

1:16:20.877 --> 1:16:21.845
Ahh!

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:25.348
[bullets ricocheting]

1:16:25.414 --> 1:16:27.984
- Cool.
Someone put a little mirror here

1:16:28.051 --> 1:16:29.252
where you can, like,
see behind--

1:16:29.318 --> 1:16:30.920
[glass shattering]
Heh-heh.

1:16:30.987 --> 1:16:32.789
- I don't see it, where?

1:16:32.856 --> 1:16:34.057
Ah!
- Ugh!

1:16:34.123 --> 1:16:35.358
[tires screeching]

1:16:35.424 --> 1:16:36.626
- Hey Butt-Head, they stopped.

1:16:36.693 --> 1:16:38.427
- We got 'em
right where we want 'em.

1:16:38.494 --> 1:16:39.929
- Ah, ah!
- Ugh!

1:16:42.732 --> 1:16:43.667
- Get out of the car.

1:16:43.733 --> 1:16:46.069
- [speaking language]

1:16:48.705 --> 1:16:49.873
[glass shattering]

1:16:49.939 --> 1:16:51.107
[crash]

1:16:51.174 --> 1:16:53.542
- Of course.
- What the hell?

1:16:53.609 --> 1:16:55.311
- That's right, baby.

1:16:55.378 --> 1:16:57.580
Our little dance of seduction
is now complete.

1:16:57.647 --> 1:16:59.415
Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm, yeah, heh, oh, yeah.

1:16:59.482 --> 1:17:02.318
- Hold your fire.

1:17:02.385 --> 1:17:06.155
24 years ago,
you nearly destroyed me.

1:17:06.222 --> 1:17:08.524
And now you've traveled
through time and space

1:17:08.591 --> 1:17:11.227
to try to destroy me again.

1:17:11.294 --> 1:17:14.097
I want to be the one to do this.

1:17:14.163 --> 1:17:15.965
- Yes!
Heh-heh.

1:17:16.032 --> 1:17:17.533
- Yes, it's really
going to happen!

1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:18.768
[snickering]

1:17:18.835 --> 1:17:20.904
- Wait, bu--why are you happy?

1:17:20.970 --> 1:17:23.539
- Uh, because, milady,

1:17:23.606 --> 1:17:25.441
we are about to score with thee.

1:17:25.508 --> 1:17:26.710
- Together.

1:17:26.776 --> 1:17:28.712
- Heh-heh, heh-heh.
- Hm, yeah, heh-heh.

1:17:28.778 --> 1:17:30.113
- Hang on.

1:17:30.179 --> 1:17:32.548
Do you think I'm going
to have sex with you?

1:17:32.615 --> 1:17:34.117
- Uh, yeah.

1:17:34.183 --> 1:17:35.685
Heh-heh.
- So, um, should we do it here

1:17:35.752 --> 1:17:37.821
or in the kitchen,
'cause I think that guy

1:17:37.887 --> 1:17:39.088
wants to watch or something?

1:17:39.155 --> 1:17:41.090
- Heh-heh.
- Hm, yeah, heh.

1:17:41.157 --> 1:17:43.292
- Yeah, you said
you'd have sex with us

1:17:43.359 --> 1:17:45.895
back at Space Camp.
Remember?

1:17:45.962 --> 1:17:47.931
- What did I say at Space Camp?

1:17:47.997 --> 1:17:49.065
[twinkling chimes]

1:17:49.132 --> 1:17:51.000
- How would you guys
like to do that,

1:17:51.067 --> 1:17:53.469
but do it for real, with me?

1:17:53.536 --> 1:17:55.338
- Whoa.
- Yes!

1:17:55.404 --> 1:17:57.273
- That wasn't so hard, was it?

1:17:57.340 --> 1:17:58.541
- Well, actually,
it was pretty hard

1:17:58.607 --> 1:18:00.276
until the last five minutes
or so,

1:18:00.343 --> 1:18:01.610
but then I got barf on it.

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:04.113
And then, you know, just, heh,
see you later.

1:18:04.180 --> 1:18:07.751
- To me, the most exciting
part is re-entry.

1:18:07.817 --> 1:18:09.853
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm-heh-heh.

1:18:09.919 --> 1:18:10.987
Yeah, we get to do it twice!

1:18:11.054 --> 1:18:12.688
[dramatic music]

1:18:12.756 --> 1:18:13.890
- Do it...

1:18:13.957 --> 1:18:15.792
so hard...

1:18:15.859 --> 1:18:17.626
re-entry...

1:18:17.693 --> 1:18:20.363
Oh, my God.
You were never out to get me.

1:18:20.429 --> 1:18:22.832
You just wanted to have sex
with me.

1:18:22.899 --> 1:18:24.533
- Yeah, baby, heh-heh.

1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:26.702
- Guilty as charged, heh,
you know what I'm saying?

1:18:26.770 --> 1:18:27.937
Hm-hm-hm-hm-heh.

1:18:28.004 --> 1:18:29.605
- These boys aren't my enemies,

1:18:29.672 --> 1:18:32.341
and they're not aliens out
to destroy our way of life.

1:18:32.408 --> 1:18:37.747
They're just two very, very
stupid and horny teenagers.

1:18:37.814 --> 1:18:40.449
[quiet music]

1:18:40.516 --> 1:18:42.051
- Uh, huh?

1:18:42.118 --> 1:18:43.519
Heh-heh.
- Yeah, come on, heh-heh.

1:18:43.586 --> 1:18:45.822
- Boi-yoi-yoi-ing!

1:18:45.889 --> 1:18:48.024
- I can't believe I've been
hanging on to this

1:18:48.091 --> 1:18:49.625
for 24 years.

1:18:49.692 --> 1:18:51.761
- Yeah, I've been
hanging on to it too.

1:18:51.828 --> 1:18:53.262
Hm-hm-heh.

1:18:53.329 --> 1:18:56.933
- And now, I know you mean
you've been masturbating.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.935
It's all so simple.

1:18:59.002 --> 1:19:01.404
- Well, I'll be.

1:19:01.470 --> 1:19:02.705
Masturbating.

1:19:02.772 --> 1:19:05.641
- Let's all go home.

1:19:05.708 --> 1:19:07.676
- Oh, no, I'm not gonna
let everyone

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:09.345
just walk away from this.

1:19:09.412 --> 1:19:13.049
I know everything you've done,
every law you've broken.

1:19:13.116 --> 1:19:15.785
That's right, from now on,
it's gonna be my turn because--

1:19:15.852 --> 1:19:16.920
[synthetic whooshing]

1:19:16.986 --> 1:19:18.254
- What?
- What the hell?

1:19:18.321 --> 1:19:20.990
- Beavis and Butt-Head,
hear us.

1:19:21.057 --> 1:19:23.692
- You need to open the door
first, Smart Butt-Head.

1:19:23.759 --> 1:19:25.261
- Yes, yes, the door, yes.

1:19:25.328 --> 1:19:28.164
- Well observed, Smart Beavis,
well observed, yes.

1:19:28.231 --> 1:19:30.266
Beavis and Butt-Head, hear us.

1:19:30.333 --> 1:19:32.301
You have mere seconds
to enter the portal.

1:19:32.368 --> 1:19:34.403
- Only by the two of you
entering this portal

1:19:34.470 --> 1:19:36.239
can our universes be saved.

1:19:36.305 --> 1:19:39.742
- Otherwise, the entire cosmos
shall perish forever.

1:19:39.809 --> 1:19:41.510
Make haste.

1:19:41.577 --> 1:19:43.746
- Uh, okay, haste.

1:19:43.813 --> 1:19:47.150
- No, they are witnesses and
they are not going anywhere!

1:19:47.216 --> 1:19:49.018
And I don't know
who you two freaks are

1:19:49.085 --> 1:19:52.255
or how you're mixed up in this,
but I'm gonna find out.

1:19:52.321 --> 1:19:54.657
I am done being a laughingstock.

1:19:54.723 --> 1:19:57.226
I've already called the Federal
whistleblower hotline

1:19:57.293 --> 1:19:58.962
and as soon as I get off hold--

1:19:59.028 --> 1:20:00.296
- Hello, can I help you?

1:20:00.363 --> 1:20:02.065
- You sure can,
I am calling

1:20:02.131 --> 1:20:03.766
from Highland, Texas, and I--

1:20:03.833 --> 1:20:07.436
[screams]

1:20:07.503 --> 1:20:08.604
- Hello?

1:20:08.671 --> 1:20:10.273
Hello?

1:20:10.339 --> 1:20:12.641
[scoffs] Asshole.

1:20:12.708 --> 1:20:15.411
[whoosh]

1:20:18.081 --> 1:20:20.249
- Hmm.
Well, I will be damned.

1:20:20.316 --> 1:20:21.817
- That appears to have worked.

1:20:21.885 --> 1:20:23.619
- We thought it needed
to be the two of you

1:20:23.686 --> 1:20:24.854
to go through the portal.

1:20:24.921 --> 1:20:26.622
But I guess anything
would have worked.

1:20:26.689 --> 1:20:28.391
We could have
thrown a brick in there.

1:20:28.457 --> 1:20:30.359
- It's safe to say,
we were making it

1:20:30.426 --> 1:20:32.428
more complicated
than it needed to be.

1:20:32.495 --> 1:20:34.130
- While we are the smartest
Beavis and Butt-Head

1:20:34.197 --> 1:20:35.464
in all the cosmos,

1:20:35.531 --> 1:20:38.634
in absolute terms,
we're still not so bright.

1:20:38.701 --> 1:20:39.936
- Okay, boys.

1:20:40.003 --> 1:20:42.105
No one can know what
happened here tonight.

1:20:42.171 --> 1:20:43.907
So what will it take
to keep you quiet?

1:20:43.973 --> 1:20:46.009
- Uh, we want to score.

1:20:46.075 --> 1:20:47.443
Heh-heh.

1:20:47.510 --> 1:20:48.844
- Oh, God.

1:20:48.912 --> 1:20:52.348
I mean, I suppose it's not
the most disgusting thing

1:20:52.415 --> 1:20:54.450
I've done for my career.

1:20:54.517 --> 1:20:56.419
So would it have to be
both of you?

1:20:56.485 --> 1:20:58.221
- That's right, Serena.

1:20:58.287 --> 1:20:59.622
We're a team.
- Yep.

1:20:59.688 --> 1:21:01.124
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm-hm-hm-heh.

1:21:01.190 --> 1:21:06.162
- Oh, God, this is, oof, rough.

1:21:06.229 --> 1:21:09.432
I'm gonna need a minute
to think about this.

1:21:09.498 --> 1:21:12.835
- Um, heh, Serena,
whatever you decide,

1:21:12.902 --> 1:21:14.637
you know, like, either way,

1:21:14.703 --> 1:21:16.372
there's something
I need to tell you.

1:21:16.439 --> 1:21:17.473
[tender music] Um, heh.

1:21:17.540 --> 1:21:20.043
Something I tried to say before,

1:21:20.109 --> 1:21:21.844
but I didn't have the courage.

1:21:21.911 --> 1:21:23.546
- Go ahead, Beavis.

1:21:23.612 --> 1:21:27.250
- Now Serena, I've been
on a long journey

1:21:27.316 --> 1:21:29.852
and I've been to outer space

1:21:29.919 --> 1:21:31.420
and I've been in a toilet.

1:21:31.487 --> 1:21:34.123
And I think I've been
to some other places

1:21:34.190 --> 1:21:36.092
that, um, heh, I don't remember.

1:21:36.159 --> 1:21:37.760
But um--
- You went to college.

1:21:37.826 --> 1:21:40.196
- Oh, yeah, yeah, heh,
I went to college--

1:21:40.263 --> 1:21:42.331
- And you went to jail.

1:21:42.398 --> 1:21:44.633
- No, I don't remember that.

1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:48.137
Anyway, along the way,
I learned some things and stuff.

1:21:48.204 --> 1:21:49.538
Or something, and, um, heh.

1:21:49.605 --> 1:21:53.376
And so now, I finally am ready

1:21:53.442 --> 1:21:56.212
to say to you what I've been
wanting to say,

1:21:56.279 --> 1:21:57.413
which is that--

1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:01.050
that I--I, um, heh, I lo--

1:22:01.117 --> 1:22:02.818
I--I--

1:22:02.885 --> 1:22:04.287
I--I lo--

1:22:04.353 --> 1:22:06.022
- Come on, kid, you can do it.

1:22:06.089 --> 1:22:07.256
- I--

1:22:07.323 --> 1:22:08.491
- I love you, Serena.

1:22:08.557 --> 1:22:10.593
For years,
I have watched you from afar

1:22:10.659 --> 1:22:13.029
through the portal,
entranced by your beauty,

1:22:13.096 --> 1:22:14.497
your elegance, your grace,

1:22:14.563 --> 1:22:16.665
your intelligence,
your knowledge of science.

1:22:16.732 --> 1:22:18.101
- Wait a second.

1:22:18.167 --> 1:22:19.902
- And I have a better
offer for you.

1:22:19.969 --> 1:22:21.604
Come with me to my universe,

1:22:21.670 --> 1:22:23.672
and I will show you the
mysteries of the cosmos

1:22:23.739 --> 1:22:25.874
as we travel across
the galaxies,

1:22:25.941 --> 1:22:28.377
beyond anything
NASA will ever achieve...

1:22:28.444 --> 1:22:30.413
fulfilling all the dreams
you ever had

1:22:30.479 --> 1:22:33.382
since you were a little girl
staring up at the stars.

1:22:33.449 --> 1:22:35.518
* *

1:22:35.584 --> 1:22:39.322
- Wow, that is, surprisingly,

1:22:39.388 --> 1:22:41.557
everything I've ever dreamed of.

1:22:41.624 --> 1:22:43.592
- Um, I have an offer too,
um, heh.

1:22:43.659 --> 1:22:46.162
I found a coupon in the car
for Taco Bell.

1:22:46.229 --> 1:22:48.197
I was thinking maybe we could,
um,

1:22:48.264 --> 1:22:49.765
we could go have a taco--

1:22:49.832 --> 1:22:52.101
- Also I was thinking
we might score.

1:22:52.168 --> 1:22:53.102
- You know what?

1:22:53.169 --> 1:22:54.537
So was I.

1:22:54.603 --> 1:22:57.106
- Yeah, sometimes the
Taco Bell has a Pizza Hut.

1:22:57.173 --> 1:23:00.109
You know, if you don't like
tacos, heh, or nachos.

1:23:00.176 --> 1:23:02.078
[whoosh]

1:23:02.145 --> 1:23:05.781
- I have a gigantic schlong.
I hope that's okay.

1:23:05.848 --> 1:23:07.950
* *

1:23:08.017 --> 1:23:10.286
- Oh, boy, yeah, I knew it.

1:23:10.353 --> 1:23:11.320
Here we go again.

1:23:11.387 --> 1:23:13.089
Hm-hm-hm-hm-heh.

1:23:13.156 --> 1:23:15.624
- Beavis, you're a dumbass.

1:23:15.691 --> 1:23:17.026
Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm-hm-hm-heh.

1:23:17.093 --> 1:23:20.196
- Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh-heh.
- Heh, hm-hm-hm-heh.

1:23:20.263 --> 1:23:22.965
[quiet music]

1:23:23.032 --> 1:23:24.367
- And there you have it.

1:23:24.433 --> 1:23:26.702
The greatest story ever told.

1:23:26.769 --> 1:23:28.704
Heh-heh-heh.
- Pretty cool, yeah, heh-heh.

1:23:28.771 --> 1:23:31.274
- We promised those government
buttholes that we wouldn't

1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:32.908
tell anyone what happened,
and they gave us

1:23:32.975 --> 1:23:35.344
a brand-new TV
and put our house back

1:23:35.411 --> 1:23:36.979
exactly the way it was.

1:23:37.046 --> 1:23:40.383
- And it wasn't me,
but somewhere out there,

1:23:40.449 --> 1:23:41.850
there's a Beavis who scored.

1:23:41.917 --> 1:23:43.452
Hm, yeah, heh-heh-heh.

1:23:43.519 --> 1:23:47.323
- Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh-heh.
- Heh, hm-hm, heh.

1:23:47.390 --> 1:23:49.525
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Hm, heh-heh, heh-heh.

1:23:49.592 --> 1:23:52.895
[triumphant music]

1:23:52.961 --> 1:24:00.436
* *

1:24:01.670 --> 1:24:06.008
[cheers and applause]

1:24:13.649 --> 1:24:17.220
- Smart Beavis
and Smart Butt-Head,

1:24:17.286 --> 1:24:19.054
we honor you.

1:24:19.122 --> 1:24:25.794
- For you, Smart Beavis, are
the first among us to score.

1:24:25.861 --> 1:24:29.765
- And you, Smart Butt-Head,
were able to watch

1:24:29.832 --> 1:24:34.603
by hiding in a suitcase
at the foot of the bed.

1:24:34.670 --> 1:24:36.472
- Serena left immediately

1:24:36.539 --> 1:24:39.242
and is not returning
phone calls or texts.

1:24:39.308 --> 1:24:41.144
- But no matter.

1:24:41.210 --> 1:24:45.248
Tonight, we celebrate!

1:24:45.314 --> 1:24:48.851
[cheers and applause]

1:24:48.917 --> 1:24:53.889
[snickering]

1:25:04.767 --> 1:25:11.907
* *

1:25:54.783 --> 1:25:56.018
- Chirp.
