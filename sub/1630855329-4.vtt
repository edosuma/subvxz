00:14.144 --> 00:17.321
The man who's got Hershel,
they call him the Croat.

00:17.452 --> 00:20.194
-Who is worth following here?
-His name is Negan.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.804
[Negan] I knew that
he was a rabid dog

00:21.934 --> 00:23.719
that needed to be put down.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.808
Blew off his ear.
The rest of him got away.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.549
So he's gonna wanna kill you.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.898
[Tommaso] If you wanna
get to the Croat,

00:29.029 --> 00:30.421
you just gotta get
through that.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.075
[Maggie] He and the Croat
know each other.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.121
They go back.
He can bait him.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.036
Lure him out of the arena.

00:36.166 --> 00:36.993
Then we kill him.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.615
[Simon] I told him
to kibosh that shit.

02:17.746 --> 02:20.662
Said you gave the order, but you
know he don't listen to me.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.273
I mean, you know, I'm not
gonna say I told you so.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.927
I'm not that kind of guy, but

02:25.057 --> 02:26.624
certain folks, a lot of folks

02:26.755 --> 02:29.758
are saying it's time
to rein his ass in.

02:29.888 --> 02:33.892
Invest more authority in,
you know, someone not unlike...

02:37.113 --> 02:38.767
We did it.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.769
Negan, we did it.

02:40.899 --> 02:43.337
The girl, she confessed.

02:43.466 --> 02:46.296
She was sent by the King,
exactly like we--

02:46.427 --> 02:48.864
He said to let her walk!

02:48.994 --> 02:51.475
He gave a direct order.

02:51.606 --> 02:55.392
Negan, you know, these things...

02:55.523 --> 02:58.352
my process, it takes time.

02:58.482 --> 02:59.875
Your process?

03:00.005 --> 03:02.704
Yes, Simon, my process.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.836

of the hidden arms cache

03:04.967 --> 03:06.098

[Simon] I would've
found that shit.

Your keen sense of observation.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.713

03:11.843 --> 03:12.975
[Simon] Emoti-blah, blah, blah,

03:13.105 --> 03:14.629
this is what I'm
talking about, Negan.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.457
Usin' these highfalutin words

03:16.587 --> 03:21.636

we all know you really are.

03:21.766 --> 03:26.162

to participate

-What's that mean?
-It means I looked everywhere.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.914
So what? He took off?

04:23.045 --> 04:25.482
Passed him on my way
in last night.

04:25.613 --> 04:29.312
Anybody outside last night
maybe see Luther head out?

04:30.139 --> 04:31.793
Still no Luther?

04:31.923 --> 04:32.881
Where would he go?

04:33.011 --> 04:34.404
Not saying he went anywhere.

04:34.534 --> 04:36.885
Just... trying to figure it out.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.539
Well, it's a little hard
to picture a guy like that

04:38.669 --> 04:40.018
playing hide-and-seek.

04:40.149 --> 04:43.761
All I know is he wasn't
real keen on this plan.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.460
[Tommaso] Yeah, it's true.
He didn't want no part in this.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.115
How long we gonna wait?

04:50.246 --> 04:51.508
Every hour's more time
for the psycho

04:51.639 --> 04:53.075
to figure out we're comin'.

04:54.772 --> 04:58.254
Hey, hey, come on.
Luther's his own guy, right?

04:58.385 --> 05:00.300
He can do what he wants.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.997
Tell you what.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.695
Time he gets back and
sees the shit we pulled,

05:04.826 --> 05:07.350
his thankful ass gonna be
kissin' your butt ugly feet.

05:07.481 --> 05:10.353

05:51.742 --> 05:53.788
-You ready?
-Yeah.

05:58.575 --> 06:01.273
You know what?
Honestly...

06:01.404 --> 06:05.016
No, I'm not.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.497
And no, it's not
'cause he wants me dead.

06:07.628 --> 06:11.762
Hell, lots of people
have wanted me dead.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.461
It's hard to explain,
you know? It's...

06:14.591 --> 06:17.986
The closer
we get to the Croat...

06:18.116 --> 06:20.597
it just starts to feel
a bit too goddamn familiar.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.121
Like, if he starts talkin',
it won't be him at all.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.819
It's gonna be the
echo of some song

06:24.949 --> 06:26.603
that I don't wanna hear no more.

06:26.734 --> 06:31.347
[harmonica starts up again]

06:32.566 --> 06:34.263
What is it?

06:36.744 --> 06:39.659
When Hershel was a baby,

06:39.790 --> 06:41.052
like four or five months old,

06:41.183 --> 06:44.273
there was this guy,
Amos, living above us.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.276
And Hershel was having
trouble sleeping, and...

06:47.407 --> 06:51.498
Amos decided it was a good
time to learn the harmonica.

06:51.628 --> 06:55.371
I asked him very nicely if he
could stop practicing at night.

06:55.502 --> 06:58.635
And, uh, he said that he would.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.030
Come that night,
he did it again.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.163
So the next time he was
out on a hunting expedition,

07:05.294 --> 07:06.730
I snuck into his room
and I stole the harmonica,

07:06.861 --> 07:08.645
and I went and buried it
in the fucking ground.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.782
Well...

07:14.912 --> 07:17.524
I bet you lost a couple
Girl Scout badges for that.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.920
Yeah, but I'm sure you would've
buried it somewhere way worse.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.705

07:28.491 --> 07:30.188

13:18.232 --> 13:20.887

I was like,

41:27.702 --> 41:29.356
Well, we got to fill it up
with walkers, obviously,

41:29.487 --> 41:31.358
and there has to be
a giant battle.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.012
I was excited
for that whole sequence.

41:33.142 --> 41:38.104
I knew it was going to be epic
and I'm so blown away.

41:38.234 --> 41:41.063
The director, Kevin Dowling,
just did an incredible job.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.848
Everybody involved
did such a great job.

41:42.978 --> 41:45.720
And I think he did it in
like just a couple of days.

41:45.851 --> 41:48.027
So many shots,
so much you got to cover.

41:48.157 --> 41:52.118
[Walkers growling]

It's not just about seeing
the violence and the fighting.

you know, when Tommaso and Amaia

41:58.820 --> 42:00.735
see each other
across the arena

42:00.866 --> 42:03.695
and you see, you know,
the love in their eyes,

42:03.825 --> 42:06.175
the longing, the fear,
and you realize,

42:06.306 --> 42:07.699

No!

42:14.357 --> 42:16.577
So there's this crucial moment
where Maggie,

42:16.708 --> 42:18.274
she sees a way out

42:18.405 --> 42:20.494
and then she stops
with this sort of sixth sense,

42:20.625 --> 42:23.671
and she turns, and there's
Ginny inside the octagon,

42:23.802 --> 42:25.325
safe but trapped,

42:25.455 --> 42:27.066
and she has a moment
there where she has to decide,

42:27.196 --> 42:28.633
am I going to keep going
or am I going to turn back?

42:28.763 --> 42:30.635
And I like to think
of that moment

42:30.765 --> 42:32.071

to this earlier moment

42:45.954 --> 42:48.304
I think, on some level,
it's a combination for her of

42:48.435 --> 42:50.306
when she's staring
at that little girl,

42:50.437 --> 42:52.004
she can't leave her behind,

but also her needing to not be
the person that Negan is,

42:54.833 --> 42:57.444
to not be at his level,
to be better than that.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.533

with a flashback

42:59.664 --> 43:01.361

out of seeing Simon again.

Um...

43:08.107 --> 43:09.543
We got a problem.

43:09.674 --> 43:11.806
When the actor Steven Ogg
showed up,

43:11.937 --> 43:13.721
he and Jeffrey
were, like, cracking jokes

43:13.852 --> 43:16.724
and having the time of their
lives like two little kids.

43:16.855 --> 43:19.466
And it's a scene where we really
get to see that experience

43:19.597 --> 43:21.337
of what that felt like for Negan
to walk into this room

43:21.468 --> 43:23.905
and see this young girl
the same age as Ginny,

43:24.036 --> 43:25.515
maybe, that The Croat
has tortured to death,

43:25.646 --> 43:28.431
and he doesn't even see
what he's done.

43:28.562 --> 43:31.652
And it's really hard and painful
for Negan to witness.

43:31.783 --> 43:33.523
And then, we kind of
come out in the present

43:33.654 --> 43:35.613
and we realize this isn't
just a generic flashback.

43:35.743 --> 43:37.223
This is what's on Negan's mind.

43:37.353 --> 43:40.574
The closer we get
to The Croat,

43:40.705 --> 43:42.881
it just starts to feel a bit too
[no audio] damn familiar.

43:43.011 --> 43:45.492
I know it maybe sounds odd
to say, thinking of the fact

43:45.623 --> 43:47.059
that The Croat
is probably older than Negan,

43:47.189 --> 43:50.105
but in some ways, The Croat
was his first child.

43:50.236 --> 43:52.194
He taught him how to bounce back

43:52.325 --> 43:54.980
from the tragedy
of the loss of his family

43:55.110 --> 43:57.852

in this threatening world.

to show off this world

I think the most fun thing
to watch as a producer on set

we went to go,

for Armstrong
