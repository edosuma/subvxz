00:02.001 --> 00:03.419
Previously on Lost:

00:03.504 --> 00:06.464
I met my real father. Great news, right?

00:06.548 --> 00:09.592
He pretended to love me
just long enough to steal my kidney.

00:09.677 --> 00:13.137
I followed you last night.
Is it your father's house?

00:13.222 --> 00:16.557
Promise me that you're not
gonna go to that place anymore.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.810
All right.

00:18.894 --> 00:22.021
You think you're the first person
that ever got conned?

00:22.106 --> 00:25.858
You needed a father figure
and I needed a kidney.

00:25.943 --> 00:29.112
- Hey, Helen...
- You're gonna have to choose.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.364
Him or me.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.412
My name is Henry Gale.
I'm from Minnesota.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.707
You draw up a map to your balloon.
We go out there, we find it.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.542
If I mess up, they'll crucify me.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.877
Do you or do you not know where it is?

00:44.962 --> 00:47.380
I went back there to bury my wife.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.216
- It's to his balloon.
- This is at least a day's walk.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.344
- We should get going.
- This is where he said it would be.

00:53.429 --> 00:54.846
We need to be sure.

00:54.930 --> 00:59.183
If I was one of them, these people
that you seem to think are your enemies,

00:59.268 --> 01:04.897
there'd be no balloon, so I'd draw a map
to a real secluded place.

01:04.982 --> 01:09.485
And when your friends got there, a bunch
of my people'd be waiting for them.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.030
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

01:38.515 --> 01:41.601
So, what did I do to deserve this?

01:41.685 --> 01:47.273
What? Can't a fella take his girl
out for a picnic lunch just 'cause?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.066
"Fella"?

01:49.151 --> 01:52.195
That's right. Fella.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.866
So, where you taking me?

01:56.950 --> 02:00.495
I'm not telling, so just quit asking.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.955
Can I be of any help?

02:03.040 --> 02:06.334
You just read your obituaries
and drink your coffee

02:06.418 --> 02:10.128
and I'll take care of the everything.

02:10.214 --> 02:14.133
Don't knock the obits;
it's the nicest part of the paper.

02:14.218 --> 02:17.762
No one ever says anything mean
about people once they're dead.

02:17.846 --> 02:22.350
And here I am thinking the funnies
are the nicest part of the paper.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.563
John...

02:29.691 --> 02:32.318
John, what's your father's name?

02:33.987 --> 02:39.075
- Why?
- Is it Anthony? Anthony Cooper?

02:41.745 --> 02:43.788
Yes. That's right.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.584
He's dead.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.347
Draw it again: The map to your balloon.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.724
I was joking. I was making a joke.

03:08.564 --> 03:11.774
There's nothing out there
besides my balloon.

03:12.651 --> 03:16.946
I was just frustrated.
It was a stupid thing to say. I'm sorry.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.285
It's too late anyway.
She's already long gone, Jack.

03:22.369 --> 03:26.205
- So, what's done is done?
- That's right.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.170
Put him back in the armory.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.311
Why do you let him
talk to you like that?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.780
- Hey, wait, I...
- Shut up.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.784
John, I'm sorry.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.704
John!

04:14.504 --> 04:18.089
Maybe he's wrong. We should
search the other side of the cliff.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.844
We've been searching for three hours.
This balloon does not exist.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.847
- Charlie!
- Then why'd he draw the map?

04:24.932 --> 04:28.142
You said you'd protect him
whether we found the balloon or not.

04:28.226 --> 04:33.230
You've given him two more days to stall,
to figure out how to escape.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.191
We're done.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.195
- Charlie!
- Over here! This way!

04:41.365 --> 04:42.740
Sayid!

04:49.706 --> 04:53.584
He said he buried her, right? His wife?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.303
Why isn't it raining here?

05:37.295 --> 05:42.133
- Hurley, have you seen Ana Lucia?
- She took off into the jungle

05:42.217 --> 05:45.261
- with Charlie and Sayid yesterday.
- Yesterday?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.432
She say anything about
where they were going?

05:49.516 --> 05:54.103
Well, that would, like, assume
anybody actually tells me anything.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.189
Maybe if I were in the loop,
I could be more helpful.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.650
There is no loop, Hurley.

05:59.735 --> 06:04.697
Excuse me, Jack. He's been really hot
and fussy. Do you mind having a look?

06:04.781 --> 06:07.116
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
- Thanks.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.165
Loop, dude. Loop.

06:15.250 --> 06:19.211
- So, the fever's completely gone?
- Completely.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.798
You're not just saying that, right?
You seem a bit distracted.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.218
I'm fine. And so is Aaron.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.720
Thanks.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.723
Doctor still in?

06:31.975 --> 06:36.395
I was grabbing for mussels in the
tide pool, pissed off a sea urchin.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.232
Well, doesn't look infected.
A little Neosporin wouldn't hurt.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.735
Yeah. Right. Neosporin.

06:42.819 --> 06:48.824
I think the current rate of exchange
is ten loads of laundry for a tube.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.659
Right.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.502
What was that?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.259
John?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.178
What's the matter?

08:51.656 --> 08:54.491
You sure you want to do this?

08:58.788 --> 09:02.625
We could just go on that picnic,
you know.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.462
Soon, I promise.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.135
Hey...

09:13.220 --> 09:15.387
Maybe he left you his kidney.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.855
"For we who are alive, who are left,

09:24.940 --> 09:29.193
will be caught up together with them in
the clouds to meet the Lord in the air,

09:29.277 --> 09:32.196
and so we will live
with the Lord forever."

09:36.159 --> 09:40.871
We commit the soul of Anthony Cooper to
you, that we shall never be separated.

09:44.459 --> 09:49.672
And now we are united with Christ
as we go toward him. Amen.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.344
Do you wish to say anything, John?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.483
I forgive you.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.292
Please proceed...

10:27.377 --> 10:28.711
John?

10:30.714 --> 10:32.214
Hey, you out there?

10:35.051 --> 10:39.305
What's that noise?
John? What's going on? Talk to me.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.849
- Will you be quiet?
- Tell me what's happening.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.060
- What the hell is...
- Will you shut up?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.939
Ten, nine, eight,

10:49.024 --> 10:50.482
seven,

10:50.567 --> 10:56.655
- six, five, four, three, two...
- Maybe you should get Jack!

10:56.740 --> 10:59.199
- I said, shut up!
- ...one.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.600
What happened?

11:31.691 --> 11:35.986
- I bet four papayas.
- You can't bet. I just bet.

11:36.071 --> 11:40.240
You can either call, or raise,
or lay 'em down, muttonchops.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.704
Don't look at me.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.749
Lay them down, Hurley.
He's got you beat.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.711
- Dude. I've got a killer hand.
- No, you don't.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.547
- But you don't know...
- You got a baby straight.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.674
He's got the flush.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.263
What about me? What do I got?

12:04.557 --> 12:08.143
Hard to say, but you're just playing
for the fun of it.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.563
Well, fun's not bad.
You should try it sometime.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.110
Don't call him, Hurley.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.195
Hey, Amarillo Slim!

12:20.073 --> 12:24.493
You think because you watch poker on TV
you can tussle with the big boys?

12:24.577 --> 12:29.665
- I've gotta head back to the hatch.
- Hatch ain't going nowhere, Doc.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.377
So how about you put your mangoes
where your mouth is?

12:40.510 --> 12:42.886
I guess I could play a hand or two.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.731
Hey! What's going on?

13:01.156 --> 13:04.783
Are you still out there? John? John?

13:04.868 --> 13:06.410
I'm here.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.579
What were those noises? What's wrong?

13:08.663 --> 13:11.665
- Did something...
- Nothing is wrong.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.933
So what's the verdict, Mr. Locke?

13:31.019 --> 13:33.395
The seismic bolting is all first-rate,

13:33.480 --> 13:37.316
there's no visible mold, no dry rot.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.444
It'll all be in my report,

13:40.528 --> 13:43.739
but I think you and your husband
got a pretty nice house here.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.285
If I had a husband,
I'm sure he would be happy to hear that.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.539
If you'll just sign this invoice.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.740
Hello, Son.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.792
What do you want?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.545
Look, John...

14:39.629 --> 14:41.797
I know what I did to you was wrong.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.840
You stole my kidney.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.886
I was dying.

14:47.971 --> 14:52.558
You could have asked me.
You could have just asked me.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.192
What do you want from me?

15:03.278 --> 15:08.073
I killed myself off because there are
two men who were going to beat me to it.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.577
Oh! What did you do, steal their livers?

15:11.661 --> 15:17.416
No. I took them for 700,000 dollars.
Retirement con.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.754
I put the money in a safe deposit box,

15:22.839 --> 15:26.925
but these two guys might be sitting
on the bank to see if I show my face,

15:27.010 --> 15:32.014
which is why I need you to go in there
and get it for me.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.398
Do you think I'm stupid?

15:41.482 --> 15:45.068
I want you to take 200 grand of it.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.115
It won't make up for what I did to you,

15:50.199 --> 15:52.326
but it's the best I can do.

15:54.537 --> 15:59.291
I'll be at the Flightline Motel, near
the airport, until tomorrow afternoon.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.669
And then I'm gone, money or no money.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.006
And, John, if I don't see you again...

16:08.301 --> 16:10.594
I'll understand.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.981
We're locked in.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.154
What?

16:29.906 --> 16:34.660
These blast doors came down.
The whole living area is sealed off.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.496
I can't get out.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.791
- Did you try to pry...
- Yeah, but I couldn't...

16:44.629 --> 16:46.004
Maybe...

16:47.882 --> 16:50.926
- Maybe if the two of us...
- You want me to help you?

16:55.264 --> 16:56.598
Yeah.

16:58.059 --> 17:01.895
And if I do help you
get these doors up...

17:03.106 --> 17:05.941
then you're gonna lock me back in here,
aren't you?

17:10.195 --> 17:12.155
That's right.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.954
Then I'm going to need your word, John.

17:20.957 --> 17:26.169
I'm gonna need your word that you
won't let your people do anything to me.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.214
If you're who you say you are,
what are you worried about?

17:29.298 --> 17:33.635
Things have happened to them,
things that I had nothing to do with.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.806
But they've got no one to blame,
except for me.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.810
So, I'm gonna need your word...

17:41.894 --> 17:44.438
that you'll protect me.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.273
No matter what.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.252
Who are you?

18:10.882 --> 18:12.924
My name is Henry Gale.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.177
I'm from Minnesota.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.347
And I crashed on this island
just like you.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.689
All right. You have my word.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.535
- Dude, you got me.
- I'm out.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.873
Think you're in my head, Doc?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.292
You've still got three papayas.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.419
Call or fold.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.130
Well, you're in trouble now, Cool Hand.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.549
Pocket Queens makes me a set.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.475
Kings wired.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.477
Whoa, dude.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.481
But at least I'm not in your head.

19:12.193 --> 19:15.612
- Well, I guess that's it.
- What do you mean, "it"?

19:15.696 --> 19:18.824
Sawyer, you're busted. I got it all.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.827
Wouldn't be fair for you
to go and pick more mangoes.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.621
Well, I got a hell of a lot more
than mangoes.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.915
You wanna play real stakes? Name 'em.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.962
- It's a pile of fruit, man.
- And I want it back.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.797
Should I go and get a ruler?

19:36.259 --> 19:38.677
Fun time's over, Mongo.
Why not hit the buffet?

19:38.761 --> 19:40.679
- But, I wanna...
- Come on, Hurley.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.557
Let's go.
Leave these boys to their sandbox.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.938
One more hand, Doc.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.065
What's it gonna take?

19:53.109 --> 19:56.278
The medicine you stole from the armory.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.071
All of it.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.792
OK.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.712
Ready? One, two, three.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.140
Let's go.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.311
Harder!

20:35.902 --> 20:37.777
I'm losing it!

20:38.070 --> 20:40.697
The tool box!
Get the tool box. I'll hold it.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.158
- You sure?
- Get it!

20:44.410 --> 20:46.578
Come on! Come on! Put it under!

21:08.809 --> 21:10.769
John, wait. Don't you think...

21:16.359 --> 21:18.401
You have to stop the door.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.946
Put something else under the door!

21:21.030 --> 21:23.031
Come on, come on!

21:26.369 --> 21:30.789
Stack 'em, stack 'em.
You have to stop the pressure.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.540
Come on, come on, come on!

21:39.340 --> 21:43.468
All right, all right. Let's get you out.
Let's get you out, come on.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.762
No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

21:47.390 --> 21:51.017
All right, we'll wait until somebody
comes down. All right?

21:53.062 --> 21:55.981
It's only a matter of time. Yeah?

21:57.191 --> 21:59.484
No, we don't have time.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.987
Honey.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.033
Put on your Sunday best.

22:48.117 --> 22:52.203
- I'm taking you out to paint...
- John...

22:52.288 --> 22:55.206
We have visitors.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.794
These men say they knew your father.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.797
Hi, John, I'm Jimmy Bane.

23:05.968 --> 23:09.304
- I didn't really know him.
- She told me.

23:09.388 --> 23:13.141
But I'd like to ask you
a couple questions, if that's OK?

23:14.477 --> 23:16.352
Sure. Of course.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.522
Have you seen your father since he died,
Mr. Locke?

23:21.609 --> 23:22.734
How... Have I...?

23:22.818 --> 23:27.238
Well, we were thinking possibly
he's not dead. And maybe you know that.

23:27.323 --> 23:32.035
I mean, for his son, you didn't look
too shook up at his funeral.

23:33.496 --> 23:37.082
How dare you? If you had any idea
what that man did to him,

23:37.166 --> 23:39.918
- what that son of a bitch...
- Hey, Helen, Helen.

23:40.002 --> 23:45.465
We were there to get past him,
to get on with our lives, to let him go.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.012
- Get out of here.
- OK, OK.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.807
Just one thing before we go.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.769
What's in the bag, John?

24:01.732 --> 24:04.526
Work papers and stuff,
I'm a home inspector.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.239
You mind if we take a look?

24:31.887 --> 24:35.014
Well. There you go.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.103
Thanks for the coffee, miss.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.915
Helen, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

25:02.418 --> 25:04.586
Were you lying to those men, John?

25:07.590 --> 25:10.425
No, I was scared. I was...

25:12.261 --> 25:14.387
I was scared.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.988
So, where'd you learn
to play cards, Doc?

25:33.741 --> 25:35.617
Phuket.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.453
What the hell
were you doing in Thailand?

25:40.122 --> 25:43.625
What, you don't think
I know where Phuket is?

25:43.709 --> 25:48.630
Just 'cause I dropped out of ninth grade
don't make me an idiot.

25:48.714 --> 25:52.967
Far East, huh? I wouldn't have
taken you for a world traveler.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.386
That where you got
the art on your shoulder?

25:57.431 --> 26:01.226
- How about you deal again?
- What?

26:02.061 --> 26:04.479
This time from the top of the deck.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.902
Well, I had to try.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.708
- What does it do?
- We're not exactly sure.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.045
- And you push it...
- Every 108 minutes, yeah.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.631
- How soon does this alarm go off?
- Very...

26:31.715 --> 26:35.551
Which is why I need you to go up
through the grate and into the vents.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.596
- Grate's bolted shut. I tried.
- Yeah.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.349
There's a grate in the pantry.
Get through there.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.601
Take the vent into the dome.

26:44.561 --> 26:48.731
- Maybe we should wait for...
- We can't. It'll go off any minute.

26:51.527 --> 26:56.239
I trusted you, Henry. Now you gotta
trust me. That button has to be pushed.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.533
OK. What do I do?

26:59.535 --> 27:03.162
Once you're inside,
you'll hear the alarm beeping.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.290
And you just have to enter the numbers:

27:05.374 --> 27:11.254
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.589
And then you press "execute."

27:13.674 --> 27:16.551
Exactly those numbers
in exactly that order.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.635
Do you...

27:17.720 --> 27:21.222
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.974
- I got it.
- Go.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.392
All right.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.981
Can you reach it?

27:30.065 --> 27:31.983
I think so.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.248
Be careful.

27:51.837 --> 28:03.639
Henry!

28:12.024 --> 28:14.734
What's going on?

28:14.818 --> 28:17.820
Jack and Sawyer
are finally gonna beat each other up.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.865
Ten mangoes.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.827
OK.

28:24.912 --> 28:28.873
I'll call you with the aspirin,
and raise you a bottle of Amoxicillin.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.252
Do you even know what Amoxicillin is?

28:33.337 --> 28:38.674
You may have been to Phuket, Doc,
but I been to Tallahassee.

28:38.759 --> 28:42.845
Let's just say something was burning
and it wasn't from the sunshine.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.311
I'm all in.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.482
Well, that's the move of a man
who wants me to lay it down.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.818
You're not gonna lay it down.

28:58.362 --> 29:00.571
I'm not, huh? Why's that?

29:01.865 --> 29:04.826
Because there's a bunch of people
watching us right now

29:04.910 --> 29:07.245
and you don't want them to see you lose.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.955
Again.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.339
Well, all right.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.175
I call. What you got?

29:25.097 --> 29:29.267
A pair of nines?
You pushed in with a pair of nines?

29:29.351 --> 29:32.854
You caught me. Let's see 'em.

29:37.025 --> 29:41.154
- Guess it was enough, huh?
- Son of a bitch.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.365
I'll come get the meds later.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.201
Hey.

29:49.121 --> 29:53.958
When I asked you what you wanted for
stakes, why didn't you ask for the guns?

29:57.504 --> 30:00.965
When I need the guns...
I'll get the guns.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.559
Henry?

30:12.769 --> 30:14.812
Get up, damn it!

30:17.399 --> 30:18.608
Henry!

30:21.236 --> 30:25.490
- Henry, are you all right?
- What happened?

30:25.574 --> 30:27.992
Listen to me,
you have to get up into the vents

30:28.076 --> 30:31.954
and enter the numbers in the computer.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.332
- How long was I...
- Please! Go right now.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.459
We're running out of time.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.211
OK. Yeah.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.130
Be careful!

30:57.272 --> 30:58.773
Henry?

31:02.945 --> 31:05.112
Henry, can you hear me?

31:18.001 --> 31:24.382
Henry?

31:41.984 --> 31:44.443
Yeah, who is it?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.362
It's John.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.747
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

32:05.674 --> 32:08.426
- Any problems?
- No.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.390
Your date at my funeral, she got a name?

32:15.684 --> 32:17.143
Helen.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.273
That's a nice name. Pretty girl, too.

32:25.527 --> 32:28.613
I'm...
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

32:30.532 --> 32:35.620
- Tonight, actually.
- Well, good for you.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.371
Congratulations.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.541
Yeah, thanks.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.298
Your share.
Should buy you a nice honeymoon.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.801
I didn't do this for the money.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.389
Then why did you do it?

33:01.563 --> 33:04.649
Well... All right.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.901
My plane... I got a cab waiting.

33:09.488 --> 33:14.200
You don't want the cash,
the maid's gonna get a hell of a tip.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.249
Bye, John.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.263
Are you him?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.349
Listen, sweetheart, I...

33:39.643 --> 33:43.604
How could you?
How could you do this to him?

33:46.066 --> 33:48.359
We were moving past this.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.329
Helen, wait.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.207
You don't understand.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.251
- I was gonna tell you.
- You lied.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.795
- I can explain.
- You looked me right in the eye

34:07.879 --> 34:10.547
and you lied to me.

34:10.632 --> 34:14.051
You've made your choice, John.
You need his love more than mine.

34:14.136 --> 34:17.179
No! My choice is you. I was gonna...

34:20.308 --> 34:21.475
I love you. I...

34:21.560 --> 34:23.978
No, no, please, please. Please, Helen...

34:24.062 --> 34:27.063
Please. I love you
and I want to spend my life with you

34:27.149 --> 34:30.735
and I can't live without you, Helen.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.404
So, will...

34:37.993 --> 34:39.493
So...

34:40.620 --> 34:42.663
Will you marry me?

35:05.437 --> 35:06.896
Helen...

35:37.552 --> 35:59.406
Henry!

36:01.701 --> 36:03.619
Please say something.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.800
Henry!

37:06.057 --> 37:07.308
Henry?

37:12.647 --> 37:14.523
Anybody here?

37:18.153 --> 37:20.362
Is anybody here?

37:20.447 --> 37:22.114
Henry!

37:31.249 --> 37:33.459
You came back.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.759
What, did you think
I was gonna leave you here?

37:41.843 --> 37:46.013
- Come on. Can you stand?
- I don't...

37:48.767 --> 37:50.643
I think so.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.867
Thank you, Henry.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.329
Thank you for not leaving me.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.041
You're welcome, John.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.220
Hey. Hey, Jack. Wait up.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.306
You heading back to the hatch?

38:29.391 --> 38:30.975
Yeah.

38:31.059 --> 38:34.144
Mind if I join?
It's been a while since I had a shower

38:34.229 --> 38:38.816
- and I was just hoping that...
- Actually, the plumbing's busted.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.276
- Busted?
- The water's been running muddy.

38:41.361 --> 38:46.156
I guess we got a cracked pipe, but it's
gonna take some time to find it.

38:46.241 --> 38:50.327
Oh. Well, I guess I wasted a trip then.

38:51.496 --> 38:55.165
Well, I'll let you know as soon as we
get things worked out down there.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.667
OK.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.797
I'm glad you beat Sawyer.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.514
You know what?
The hatch can wait until morning

39:10.598 --> 39:13.225
if you'd like me to walk you
back to the beach.

39:20.734 --> 39:23.944
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

39:41.588 --> 39:43.464
It's a parachute.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.097
Wait.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.645
It's food.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.034
What the bloody hell is that?

40:18.166 --> 40:19.958
What did you find?

40:22.962 --> 40:25.047
I gotcha. Easy, easy.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.637
Sorry.

40:39.187 --> 40:45.400
What did you do? What did you do
to end it and make the doors go up?

40:46.361 --> 40:48.445
I did what you told me to.

40:48.530 --> 40:51.490
I punched in the code
and I pressed the "execute" button,

40:51.574 --> 40:54.618
but nothing happened
other than that clock flipping back.

40:54.702 --> 40:58.455
I was just climbing back into the vent
when the lights went out.

40:58.540 --> 41:01.500
Ten seconds later the doors went up.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.003
I didn't do anything.

41:05.088 --> 41:08.215
You think it was all just random?

41:09.175 --> 41:12.094
Don't look at me. It's your hatch.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.764
Get away from him.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.475
- Wait, you don't...
- Step back, right now.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.311
- Sayid, it's OK.
- I said, get away!

41:21.396 --> 41:25.983
It's all right. I let him out. There was
some kind of lockdown or something.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.402
He was helping me.

41:31.906 --> 41:35.284
- Couldn't you find my balloon?
- Yeah. We found it.

41:35.368 --> 41:37.870
We did find your balloon, Henry Gale.

41:37.954 --> 41:40.247
Exactly how you described it.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.626
We also found the grave you described.

41:44.711 --> 41:46.879
Your wife's grave.

41:46.963 --> 41:50.299
The grave you said you dug
with your own bare hands.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.468
It was all there.

41:53.553 --> 41:55.345
Your whole story. Your alibi.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.306
It was true.

42:00.268 --> 42:03.520
But still I did not
believe it to be true.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.480
So, I dug up that grave...

42:09.194 --> 42:12.946
and found that there was not
a woman inside, there was a man.

42:17.619 --> 42:19.828
A man named Henry Gale.
