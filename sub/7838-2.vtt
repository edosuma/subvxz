00:24.079 --> 00:27.708
We now return to Blackula 
Meets Black Dracula.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.902
I'm turning this disco
into a hockey rink.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.974
You mean a honky rink!

00:42.000 --> 00:45.475
You know, Black Dracula is now 
a Congressman from Virginia.

00:46.718 --> 00:48.314
Bart, where did you get those?

00:48.753 --> 00:49.922
There's an open house next door.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.934
They're giving out 
cookies and business cards!

00:52.756 --> 00:54.131
Check it out.
I'm a business jerk!

00:57.500 --> 00:59.438
Marge, I don't want
to buy this house.

00:59.597 --> 01:02.050
I'd have to live
next door to myself.

01:05.286 --> 01:05.993
Turn that down!

01:06.393 --> 01:06.882
Screw you!

01:09.908 --> 01:11.439
Relax, we're
just looky-loos.

01:11.686 --> 01:14.537
We're only here to compare 
our lifestyle to our neighbors.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.055
Marge, It's not fair to compare 
us to an American household.

01:20.772 --> 01:24.691
It's so beautiful and modern.

01:26.234 --> 01:28.621
Ooh, a Sub-Zero fridge.

01:29.575 --> 01:33.180
A slightly colder fridge?
In my lifetime?

01:33.573 --> 01:35.120
Amazing.

01:35.836 --> 01:38.191
This is the kitchen
I've always wanted.

01:39.648 --> 01:41.369
Ooh, a bread maker-maker!

01:45.563 --> 01:46.977
And check this out.

01:47.304 --> 01:48.958
A walk-in microwave!

01:49.596 --> 01:52.863
Hey, Marge, can you press 
"stop" when my popcorn's done?

02:05.300 --> 02:08.719
Homie, when I married you, I 
knew we wouldn't live in luxury.

02:08.908 --> 02:10.252
And I kept that vow.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.800
But seeing that kitchen today

02:13.801 --> 02:17.023
made me wish we had something
a little better for ourselves.

02:18.033 --> 02:20.000
I'll build you a new 
kitchen, sweetie.

02:20.038 --> 02:22.810
that's so thoughtful,

02:22.988 --> 02:26.172
but maybe we should hire
a professional contractor...

02:26.225 --> 02:27.493
A contractor?

02:27.757 --> 02:29.748
Those guys are
the biggest crooks around.

02:29.748 --> 02:32.744
They charge for materials
 and labor!

02:32.745 --> 02:34.478
Pick one, jerks!

02:48.951 --> 02:49.557
Man, that hurt.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.033
And now to do the 
exact same thing again.

02:55.484 --> 02:57.594
Maybe you should
turn off the power.

02:58.084 --> 02:58.914
All right.

03:01.798 --> 03:03.662
Don't demolish along the way!

03:05.766 --> 03:07.504
Easy, easy.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.944
Playdude magazines?

03:12.601 --> 03:14.597
Have you been hiding
bosom rags from me?

03:14.861 --> 03:15.666
Trying to.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.471
These magazines are from
before we were married.

03:19.803 --> 03:21.157
Maybe you should
throw them away.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.724
But I need them
for the articles!

03:23.094 --> 03:24.928
Les articles ?

03:25.469 --> 03:29.516
So you wouldn't mind if
I cut out all the erotic nudes?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.233
Of course not.

03:31.541 --> 03:34.699
Why would I want to look at a 
nude woman I'm not even married to?

03:34.996 --> 03:37.734
I wouldn't even know
how she could improve me.

03:41.734 --> 03:42.722
"I'm not wearing any clothes...

03:43.236 --> 03:46.975
So why don't I just splay
myself on a pool table"?

03:48.649 --> 03:50.324
Steady, steady...

03:52.985 --> 03:54.514
Here's your precious articles.

03:54.710 --> 03:57.705
Thanks, Marge, I can't 
wait to read about...

03:58.030 --> 04:01.257
"Sport Fishing with 
Sonny Jurgensen."

04:03.726 --> 04:05.899
What man would want you now?

04:08.585 --> 04:10.218
Playdudes!

04:10.585 --> 04:13.100
Let the blossoming
of Milhouse begin.

04:14.923 --> 04:18.079
I gotta be honest, I don't see 
what all the hubbub is about.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.362
Hey, the lady in 
this picture is hot.

04:20.362 --> 04:23.533
She can Calamine 
my hives anytime.

04:23.533 --> 04:25.967
That's Congresswoman Bella Abzug.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.962
"Ciao Bella"

04:28.320 --> 04:30.649
The grown-ups in this 
magazine are pretty cool.

04:31.136 --> 04:33.259
I could make the tree 
house look like this.

04:33.553 --> 04:34.861
Then we could have orgies,

04:34.885 --> 04:36.025
whatever they are.

04:37.714 --> 04:39.236
We'll be Playdude Playmates!

04:39.825 --> 04:41.966
We are Playdude Playmates!

04:41.966 --> 04:44.147
We are Playdude Playmates!

04:44.592 --> 04:46.809
There it is, nice and smooth.

04:46.809 --> 04:50.874
I'd like to see your boyfriend
the contractor do a better job.

04:51.130 --> 04:53.665
I think you used 
too much plaster.

04:53.878 --> 04:55.515
Oh, now you tell me.

04:55.516 --> 04:56.980
I never stopped telling you.

04:57.204 --> 05:00.144
So that's what that
white noise was.

05:00.476 --> 05:02.103
I'm calling a contractor.

05:06.364 --> 05:07.521
Thanks for taking the job.

05:07.863 --> 05:10.617
I'm sorry my husband
is being so difficult.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.770
Get lost, crook!

05:13.009 --> 05:14.160
That's all right,
Mrs. Simpson.

05:14.416 --> 05:16.310
Many husbands
feel emasculated...

05:16.311 --> 05:18.287
when their wife must turn
to a professional...

05:18.288 --> 05:20.234
to satisfy her
remodeling needs.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.973
Why don't you just kiss her?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.312
I'm gay. But I have a subcontractor 
that does that sort of thing for me.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.661
I like-a to kiss.

05:30.322 --> 05:33.022
Now, don't you worry. Your kitchen 
will be done in three weeks.

05:36.879 --> 05:40.014
When Virginia Woolf wrote, "Every 
woman needs a room of one's own,"

05:40.018 --> 05:42.947
she must have been 
talking about the kitchen.

05:43.023 --> 05:45.373
What's the first thing you're
gonna make in your new kitchen?

05:45.449 --> 05:47.099
How 'bout cooking 
up some money...

05:47.100 --> 05:50.537
because this stupid kitchen cost $100,000.

05:53.030 --> 05:54.747
I was thinking
of chicken wings.

05:55.110 --> 05:56.175
Those are good too.

05:59.307 --> 06:00.132
Same old stuff:

06:00.317 --> 06:02.910
meatloaf, casserole, tuna loaf,

06:03.150 --> 06:04.855
loaferole, casseloaf...

06:06.376 --> 06:09.091
Marge Simpson's
Wasabi Buffalo Wings!

06:09.379 --> 06:13.228
an Eastern twist on a 
western New York favorite.

06:18.150 --> 06:20.606
These wings are going 
straight to my thighs...

06:20.612 --> 06:22.470
and I say bon voyage!

06:22.821 --> 06:24.634
What do you think,
Thomas Pynchon?

06:27.381 --> 06:29.814
These wings 
are "V-licious!"

06:30.289 --> 06:33.350
I'll put this recipe in the 
Gravity's Rainbow Cookbook,

06:33.719 --> 06:36.746
right next to
The Frying of Latke 49.

06:37.203 --> 06:40.542
I agree with my 
fellow Cornell alumnus!

06:40.870 --> 06:42.301
Huzzah for Marge!

06:42.649 --> 06:43.673
Huzzah!

06:44.111 --> 06:47.575
And how 'bout a huzzah for my 
husband who paid for our new kitchen?

06:47.651 --> 06:48.491
Never!

06:50.394 --> 06:53.495
I thought I was Springfield's
wing ding king,

06:53.663 --> 06:56.257
but, you make my chicken look
like cock-a-diddily doo-doo.

06:56.427 --> 06:57.683
Great stuff, Ned.

06:58.027 --> 07:00.791
You know I was gonna enter
this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff...

07:00.792 --> 07:03.665
but up against you, I wouldn't
have a Hindu's chance in heaven.

07:03.928 --> 07:05.000
If you win,

07:05.001 --> 07:08.698
Ovenfresh Industries will make 
you the new face of Auntie Ovenfresh.

07:11.085 --> 07:13.564
C'mon, Marge.
It's either you, or...

07:15.979 --> 07:18.943
I guess it would be a hoot
to have my face on everything.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.888
Mrs. Simpson,you must 
pursue your dreams.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.591
Like my old dream of coming to 
America and starting a family.

07:25.810 --> 07:30.420
Or my new dream of ditching my family 
and sneaking back to India in disguise.

07:31.692 --> 07:33.281
Apu?
Never heard of him.

07:33.594 --> 07:35.164
My name is Steve Barnes.

07:40.205 --> 07:42.296
So, when do they start singing?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.014
Well, The Playdude Advisor says...

07:44.014 --> 07:46.718
this music will get a stewardess 
to give you a layover.

07:47.048 --> 07:50.229
I hope it's in Omaha.
My grammy lives there.

07:50.283 --> 07:52.740
Bart, can you come
in here for a second?

07:54.794 --> 07:57.332
Your mother's about
to show us her new recipe.

07:57.664 --> 08:00.718
Outtasight!
Lay it on me, Mama.

08:00.944 --> 08:02.512
In the Ovenfresh Bakeoff,

08:02.654 --> 08:05.524
clever presentation
is as important as taste.

08:05.764 --> 08:08.811
So I'm entering
my dessert dogs!

08:09.214 --> 08:12.294
It's deep-fried cookie 
dough with meringue buns,

08:12.554 --> 08:16.344
cherry "ketchup"
and caramel "mustard."

08:19.970 --> 08:21.680
It's dessert,
but it's hot dogs,

08:21.681 --> 08:22.659
so it's good for you!

08:25.001 --> 08:29.014
Marge, I don't want to freak you 
out, but I think I love you.

08:30.889 --> 08:34.392
I hope the Ovenfresh Bakeoff 
likes them as much as you do.

08:39.816 --> 08:41.875
Mom, a letter from 
Ovenfresh Industries!

08:42.173 --> 08:44.232
Well, open it.
Open it! Open it!

08:46.009 --> 08:48.633
"Thank you for applying
to the Ovenfresh Bakeoff.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.569
Every year many wonderful 
cooks fail to qualify."

08:54.000 --> 08:55.381
"...but screw them, you're in!

08:55.452 --> 08:56.603
Congratulations!"

08:56.875 --> 08:57.820
Oh, my God!

08:58.159 --> 09:01.824
Someone somewhere says
I'm better than someone else!

09:02.032 --> 09:03.852
I'm proud of you, honey.

09:10.095 --> 09:13.690
Sorry, Ralphie. The Bakeoff 
rejected your recipe.

09:13.894 --> 09:15.631
I wanna be in the bakeoff!

09:15.870 --> 09:16.904
There, there...

09:16.904 --> 09:19.776
I think your grilled crayon 
sandwich was delicious.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.772
You only had a pretend bite.

09:22.099 --> 09:24.017
No, I'm eating it.
Look.

09:27.908 --> 09:29.459
Can you taste the thumbtacks?

09:30.608 --> 09:31.353
Crap.

09:34.834 --> 09:37.335
I'm here live at the 
annual Ovenfresh Bakeoff,

09:37.370 --> 09:40.241
brought to you by the Ovenfresh 
Flour family of products,

09:42.677 --> 09:42.950
including...

09:50.658 --> 09:54.843
Quetzalcoatl's Choice: the favorite from Zihuatanejo to Popocatepetl.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.828
Bart looks different today.

09:58.326 --> 10:03.184
Nelson, your debonair wit 
reminds me of a young Mort Sahl.

10:04.095 --> 10:05.875
Listen up, ring-a-ding-dingers.

10:06.063 --> 10:09.277
I'm throwin' a little sip 'n' quip 
at the Playdude Treehouse

10:09.278 --> 10:11.254
Saturday night at 
the top of the ladder.

10:11.674 --> 10:13.552
Be there or be square.

10:17.008 --> 10:18.584
I want to be a triangle.

10:18.713 --> 10:19.638
You're not invited.

10:21.297 --> 10:25.062
It's going to be weird cooking without 
your tipsy father grabbing me from behind,

10:25.275 --> 10:26.916
but I think I'm up to it.

10:27.238 --> 10:31.017
Welcome to the Ovenfresh Bakeoff.
I'm Billy Bouillon Cube.

10:31.017 --> 10:33.581
Follow me to your oven station.

10:35.704 --> 10:36.943
Why, thank you, Billy.

10:37.212 --> 10:38.474
Don't look at my human eyes!

10:40.301 --> 10:41.166
Oh, don't mind Billy.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.060
His oven light's on, 
but nothing's cooking.

10:43.931 --> 10:45.712
So, what you makin'... Marge?

10:46.155 --> 10:47.937
Well... Stuart,

10:48.223 --> 10:52.081
I'm making a dessert that looks 
like a hot dog, but it isn't.

10:52.082 --> 10:54.284
You're making a "tasty fake"?

10:55.559 --> 10:57.369
That is so '90s.

10:57.722 --> 11:00.364
Why don't we all move to 
Seattle and use slow modems?

11:04.568 --> 11:07.828
Yo, Marge, your recipe...
she is pathetic.

11:08.133 --> 11:08.683
She is not!

11:13.843 --> 11:15.523
Great licks, man, great licks.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.081
There's no room
left in the grotto.

11:21.584 --> 11:22.724
Who's that adult?

11:23.077 --> 11:25.456
It wouldn't be a Playdude
party without James Caan.

11:25.890 --> 11:28.169
So, I'm trying to talk with Miss November,

11:28.170 --> 11:31.385
and Charlie Callas over here
is blocking my action with...

11:32.851 --> 11:34.428
Turns out he's choking
on a peanut.

11:34.605 --> 11:36.775
Well, a punch to the gut
cleared that right up.

11:38.376 --> 11:42.236
Bart, me and Mrs. Krabappel, we're 
going to go play some "backgammon"

11:42.487 --> 11:43.478
If you know what I mean.

11:43.558 --> 11:44.832
I don't, 
but I hope you win.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.018
Oh, he's going to win.

11:46.260 --> 11:47.751
Some guys like a challenge.

11:48.313 --> 11:48.827
Not me.

11:50.089 --> 11:51.401
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:51.402 --> 11:53.142
before we begin, 
let us introduce...

11:53.182 --> 11:56.679
Auntie Ovenfresh, 1954!

11:57.390 --> 12:01.947
Ribbons and trophies are 
no comfort on your deathbed.

12:01.977 --> 12:03.193
Auntie Ovenfresh!

12:05.273 --> 12:08.076
And now, chefs, 
start your kitchens!

12:16.056 --> 12:16.846
Fish scales?

12:17.116 --> 12:19.633
Stop! You're tainting my entry!

12:19.733 --> 12:21.199
I'm-a so sorry...

12:21.456 --> 12:23.107
It was, uh, how you say, um,

12:23.315 --> 12:25.635
"done with malice aforethought,"

12:26.303 --> 12:27.793
You did it on purpose?

12:28.219 --> 12:30.605
No, no, no, my English, 
she's a-not-a so good.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.292
I was, uh, how you say,..

12:32.789 --> 12:35.005
"ruining your food so I win,"

12:36.934 --> 12:40.397
Why is everyone at this 
bakeoff such a meanie-bo-beanie?

12:40.854 --> 12:44.706
These muffin-huffin' batter biddies 
can smell weakness a mile away...

12:44.955 --> 12:46.445
weakness named Marge!

12:46.527 --> 12:48.881
Why can't everyone 
just play fair and...?

12:49.333 --> 12:52.300
Did you just dunk your 
hair in my mixing bowl?

12:53.644 --> 12:55.334
You're weak, weak!

12:56.761 --> 12:57.781
Listen here, Simpson.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.741
Your son has been exposing 
our kids to adult themes,

13:01.058 --> 13:05.250
unabashed dictionaries and the
lesser short fiction of John Cheever.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.536
Adult themes? 
What are you talking about?

13:07.871 --> 13:10.732
My Roddy told a joke about an 
octopus and a set of bagpipes,

13:10.732 --> 13:13.229
and the punchline implied 
that they fornicated!

13:13.505 --> 13:15.094
Ralphie wants to go on the pill!

13:15.095 --> 13:16.121
Stupid Bart.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.798
Bagpipes getting 
down with an octopus...

13:19.798 --> 13:21.505
That's classic.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.553
Hot bananas coming through. Oops.

13:24.942 --> 13:25.417
My dessert!

13:32.708 --> 13:35.538
Come on, Mom. 
You still have 20 minutes left.

13:35.558 --> 13:37.001
You can fix it.

13:37.065 --> 13:37.723
You're right.

13:38.047 --> 13:41.387
If I can feed a family 
of five on $12 a week,

13:41.465 --> 13:42.840
I can do anything.

13:43.144 --> 13:45.227
You feed us on $12 a week?

13:45.374 --> 13:47.922
I stretch your father's 
meatloaf with sawdust.

13:51.900 --> 13:52.856
Attention, contestants,

13:53.338 --> 13:55.006
baking time is over.

13:55.078 --> 13:57.191
The judging will commence in one hour.

13:57.409 --> 13:59.231
If your dish is not 
in the judging room

13:59.231 --> 14:01.615
by the time this metal 
door hits the ground,

14:01.670 --> 14:03.284
your entry will 
not be official,

14:03.285 --> 14:05.097
and will be eaten
by the janitor.

14:08.224 --> 14:08.979
Hurry, Mom!

14:14.210 --> 14:16.086
I guess was the last one.

14:16.699 --> 14:17.313
Damn it!

14:21.427 --> 14:23.894
These other dishes look so pretty.

14:24.141 --> 14:26.960
And those cheaters 
blackened my sugar wieners.

14:27.356 --> 14:31.082
I'd like to give those Betty Crookeds 
a taste of their own medicine.

14:32.804 --> 14:34.118
Yes...

14:34.387 --> 14:35.688
medicine.

14:36.319 --> 14:38.657
Baby ear medicine.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.608
Even the Pope couldn't 
forgive this pizza...

14:47.874 --> 14:50.650
and he's letting a lot of 
things slide these days.

14:50.729 --> 14:53.951
Don't worry. There's 
plenty for all of you.

14:53.970 --> 14:55.645
Now who's laughing, huh, huh?

14:58.791 --> 15:00.927
Me! I'm laughing!

15:11.220 --> 15:13.255
I can't believe my mom would cheat.

15:13.438 --> 15:15.066
Hey, sweetie,is Mom winning?

15:15.098 --> 15:16.419
Oh, she'll win the contest...

15:16.802 --> 15:18.382
but she'll lose her soul.

15:18.709 --> 15:19.979
But she'll still win the contest?

15:20.021 --> 15:21.629
And lose her soul.

15:21.903 --> 15:22.838
But win the contest?

15:22.872 --> 15:23.209
Yes.

15:24.232 --> 15:26.384
If Marge becomes Auntie Ovenfresh,

15:26.626 --> 15:28.847
we'll meet all the 
food personalities...

15:30.735 --> 15:32.981
Look! 
It's Mr. Cashew,

15:33.437 --> 15:36.456
the Koobler Dwarfs, 
Snip, Crinkle and Poof...

15:36.696 --> 15:38.909
Twinkle the Kidd, I love you!

15:40.433 --> 15:42.181
Whoa-ho-ho, easy 
there, partner.

15:48.872 --> 15:50.301
You... killed him.

15:50.378 --> 15:52.710
He was my world!

15:55.388 --> 15:58.607
Blood for creme!

15:59.420 --> 16:02.606
Blood for creme!

16:03.040 --> 16:05.060
It's always difficult 
to pick two finalists,

16:05.349 --> 16:08.357
but this year it was easy. 
All the other dishes made us vomit.

16:10.575 --> 16:14.666
Our two remaining dishes are 
"Blackened Dessert Dogs" by Marge

16:14.919 --> 16:19.199
and "Armadillo a la Road" 
by Brandine No Last Name Given.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.217
That's an entry?!

16:20.470 --> 16:21.760
I thought it was garbage.

16:22.145 --> 16:25.425
Just 'cause it was cooked in a 
garbage can don't make it garbage.

16:32.963 --> 16:35.875
"Canned and frozen juices are more 
popular than ever these days..."

16:36.168 --> 16:41.108
"but most bachelors we know would 
prefer to squeeze their own tomatoes."

16:44.874 --> 16:47.224
Bachelors are always 
squeezin' stuff.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.639
Would you excuse us, Milton?

16:48.821 --> 16:50.266
It's Milhouse.

16:50.601 --> 16:52.311
Yeah, and your 
father's "No House".

16:52.390 --> 16:53.302
Now scram.

16:56.310 --> 16:57.871
Maybe I was a little hard on him. 
Oh, well.

16:58.350 --> 17:02.553
Bart, I know a father has no right to pry 
into the life of his ten-year-old son...

17:02.554 --> 17:03.712
but what's going on up here?

17:03.952 --> 17:05.676
I'm just spreadin' 
the Playdude philosophy:

17:05.704 --> 17:07.895
Hi-fis, Norman Mailer, 
gettin' some...

17:09.696 --> 17:11.547
what do you think "some" is?

17:12.520 --> 17:13.259
Uh... toys?

17:14.413 --> 17:15.981
I thought I'd never 
have to do this,

17:16.190 --> 17:18.393
but it's time to tell 
you the facts of life.

17:21.069 --> 17:22.877
Do you know what a boob is?

17:23.096 --> 17:23.874
Oh, yeah.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.586
Good, that'll save us some time.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.473
Why do you think your mother 
and I sleep in the same bed?

17:30.615 --> 17:31.757
Because we're poor?

17:32.014 --> 17:33.118
Exactly,

17:33.385 --> 17:35.142
and we're poor because we have kids.

17:35.195 --> 17:36.792
And the biological method...

17:36.792 --> 17:39.716
...by which children are created 
by a man and a woman is...

17:45.481 --> 17:46.134
And then the man...

17:50.088 --> 17:50.962
And then the woman...

17:59.479 --> 18:01.344
Well, it's better they 
hear it from me now...

18:01.542 --> 18:03.698
than from their parents 
when they're old enough.

18:08.550 --> 18:09.548
Congratulations, Mom.

18:09.549 --> 18:12.621
You seem to have a 
prescription for success.

18:12.822 --> 18:15.929
What a kind yet oddly 
ominous thing to say.

18:16.255 --> 18:18.240
Now I've got to get 
ready for the finals.

18:18.275 --> 18:20.133
Don't forget your secret ingredient...

18:20.649 --> 18:22.043
cheating!

18:23.353 --> 18:25.003
It's not my fault!

18:25.004 --> 18:28.064
Lisa, the people in this 
bakeoff are stinkers...

18:28.065 --> 18:31.465
who pushed me and pushed me 
like the pushy-wushies they are!

18:31.597 --> 18:35.345
Mom, if I don't have you to 
look up to, I don't have anyone.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.914
Look, I'll be a winner 
with feet of clay...

18:38.157 --> 18:39.539
like Mickey Mantle.

18:39.678 --> 18:41.244
Everyone loves the Mick.

18:41.422 --> 18:43.747
I don't want Mickey Mantle. 
I want my mom.

18:43.941 --> 18:47.400
Plenty of kids are going to 
look up to me when I'm Auntie...

18:47.400 --> 18:48.636
whatever it is.

18:49.318 --> 18:52.453
Right now, people just 
know me as the wife of a guy...

18:52.454 --> 18:53.613
who doesn't go to work.

18:53.887 --> 18:57.108
Can't you understand 
that I need this?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.592
I guess Dad has 
to be my hero now.

19:03.749 --> 19:05.458
Not if you knew 
what he's been doing.

19:06.957 --> 19:10.586
Welcome to the final battle 
of the Ovenfresh Challenge.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.592
She's already ahead of me.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.881
Well, I didn't come 
this far not to cheat...

19:24.111 --> 19:25.574
"I look up to you...

19:25.930 --> 19:27.752
because you let me down."

19:30.980 --> 19:33.720
That's clever... 
and devastating.

19:36.238 --> 19:37.952
Stop the competition!

19:39.326 --> 19:41.276
I don't deserve to win.

19:41.535 --> 19:44.035
I sabotaged all the other entries.

19:45.054 --> 19:47.124
Looks like me and Marge 
are both going to hell.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.734
That's when I'll make my move.

19:49.554 --> 19:53.936
Then I won... with my 
festive holiday Alco-Hog.

19:54.912 --> 19:56.539
I thought it was dead!

19:59.670 --> 20:02.216
Thanks, honey, for 
saving me from myself.

20:02.495 --> 20:06.366
And Marge, you'll always be 
the best chef in our house.

20:06.565 --> 20:08.074
Well, beat me,

20:08.248 --> 20:09.792
I do just scrambled eggs, Homer.

20:09.986 --> 20:11.866
The secret ingredient is whiskey.

20:12.758 --> 20:13.957
Hey, it keeps the kids quiet.

20:15.655 --> 20:18.110
Hey, look! 
The new Ovenfresh Flour bag!

20:18.342 --> 20:20.224
That could've been me.

20:20.559 --> 20:22.179
Oh, I wish it had've been.

20:23.551 --> 20:28.267
Now that Brandine's famous, 
she done run off with James Caan!

20:29.831 --> 20:33.062
But don't you worry. 
I'm going to fix his wagon.

20:35.516 --> 20:38.214
A toll booth? 
I hate these things....

20:55.130 --> 20:56.680
That's it. 
Next time, I fly.
