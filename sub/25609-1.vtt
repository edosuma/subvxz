<i>That's me.</i>

00:58.598 --> 01:00.632
<i>Emma Wilson.</i>

01:00.634 --> 01:02.801
<i>And this is my squad.</i>

01:02.803 --> 01:04.736
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

01:04.738 --> 01:06.938
<i>"Wow. Look at them.</i>

01:06.940 --> 01:08.773
<i>They're amazing."</i>

01:08.775 --> 01:10.841
<i>And you'd pretty much be right.</i>

01:10.843 --> 01:12.576
<i>But this isn't the first time</i>

01:12.578 --> 01:15.746
<i>I've been
in a red-hot cheer squad.</i>

01:15.748 --> 01:19.751
<i>Believe it or not,
we used to be a hot mess.</i>

01:19.753 --> 01:21.519
<i>And to understand that,</i>

01:21.521 --> 01:23.355
<i>we have to fly 8000 miles</i>

01:23.357 --> 01:24.891
<i>back to where it all began.</i>

01:33.599 --> 01:35.100
<i>My dad's in the Air Force.</i>

01:35.102 --> 01:37.335
<i>I've spent most of my life
traveling to bases</i>

01:37.337 --> 01:38.669
<i>all over the world.</i>

01:38.671 --> 01:39.971
<i>We've been stationed
in California</i>

01:39.973 --> 01:43.040
<i>for nearly 18 months now.</i>

01:43.042 --> 01:44.475
<i>It's the longest
we've been in one place</i>

01:44.477 --> 01:46.978
<i>since I can even remember.</i>

01:46.980 --> 01:50.349
<i>I was finally starting to make
real friends. That's dad.</i>

01:50.351 --> 01:52.551
<i>Ever since mom died
when I was little,</i>

01:52.553 --> 01:55.052
<i>it's just been me and him, and
today he's supposed to find out</i>

01:55.054 --> 01:57.388
<i>his new assignment,
another year here</i>

01:57.390 --> 01:58.989
<i>or having to say goodbye,
again.</i>

01:58.991 --> 02:00.359
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:00.361 --> 02:01.859
I have exciting news, Em.

02:01.861 --> 02:03.561
- We're staying in California?
- Even better.

02:03.563 --> 02:04.862
If you thought
it was great here,

02:04.864 --> 02:07.367
you're gonna love Australia.

02:09.435 --> 02:11.603
- Australia?
- It's a 12-month assignment.

02:11.605 --> 02:13.038
It could be extended
to two years.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.806
But how awesome is that?

02:14.808 --> 02:16.874
<i>Tell him
that you want to stay,</i>

02:16.876 --> 02:20.444
<i>that you have friends here,
a life.</i>

02:20.446 --> 02:22.046
<i>Uh, tell him something.</i>

02:22.048 --> 02:24.716
Look, I know we've been
moving around a lot

02:24.718 --> 02:27.919
and you have been
so understanding.

02:27.921 --> 02:30.455
But I really think
this will be good for us.

02:30.457 --> 02:33.624
Yeah, yeah,
it's, it's great, dad.

02:33.626 --> 02:35.659
Maybe I can get this extended
into something longer,

02:35.661 --> 02:39.431
but in the meantime,
it'll be an adventure.

02:39.433 --> 02:40.902
Just you and me, right?

02:42.035 --> 02:44.201
- Right.
- Okay.

02:44.203 --> 02:45.604
I'm gonna go back, report in

02:45.606 --> 02:48.173
and then let's head home
and pack.

02:48.175 --> 02:49.674
Okay.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.679
<i>I've already learned
how to say goodbye</i>

02:54.681 --> 02:56.615
<i>in six different languages.</i>

02:56.617 --> 02:59.950
<i>In Japan, they say, "Sayonara."</i>

02:59.952 --> 03:02.721
<i>But no matter
what the language,</i>

03:02.723 --> 03:05.824
<i>it never gets any easier
to say.</i>

03:23.076 --> 03:24.443
Good afternoon, Major Wilson.

03:24.445 --> 03:25.644
I'm Flight Lieutenant
Susan Thompson.

03:25.646 --> 03:27.111
I trust
your flight was enjoyable.

03:27.113 --> 03:28.513
Yes, it was fine. Thank you.

03:28.515 --> 03:29.814
This is my daughter, Emma.

03:29.816 --> 03:31.550
- Hi.
- Lovely to meet you, Emma.

03:31.552 --> 03:33.151
You know, my daughter,
Hannah, is about your age.

03:33.153 --> 03:34.485
She's looking forward
to meeting you.

03:34.487 --> 03:35.687
Cool.

03:35.689 --> 03:37.625
- Shall we?
- Please. Lead the way.

03:41.928 --> 03:43.093
I've arranged for you
to move in

03:43.095 --> 03:45.163
to the town house next to mine.

03:45.165 --> 03:47.199
The Air Force retains
several units in the complex

03:47.201 --> 03:48.403
for officer housing.

03:56.910 --> 03:59.677
Welcome to your new home.

03:59.679 --> 04:01.612
This part is just a five-minute
walk from the house

04:01.614 --> 04:03.747
if you ever wanna come down
and take in the view.

04:03.749 --> 04:04.918
Wow.

04:17.129 --> 04:20.197
Hey, Ethan. Come and meet Emma,
your new neighbor.

04:20.199 --> 04:21.966
Hey, nice to meet ya.

04:21.968 --> 04:23.735
Sorry, I'm actually running late
for training,

04:23.737 --> 04:25.803
but maybe we can hang out later?

04:25.805 --> 04:28.206
Yeah. I'd like that.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.611
See? You're making friends
already.

04:31.912 --> 04:33.080
He seemed nice.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.780
What?

04:35.782 --> 04:37.952
Let's get you in
to your new home.

04:40.987 --> 04:43.153
Come on through.

04:43.155 --> 04:44.923
The movers dropped
everything off yesterday.

04:44.925 --> 04:47.324
So I'll leave you
to look around and unpack.

04:47.326 --> 04:49.660
I'm just next door
if you need anything.

04:49.662 --> 04:51.799
- Great. Thanks, Susan.
- Thank you.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.768
Wow.

04:56.770 --> 04:59.103
What do you think?

04:59.105 --> 05:01.072
- It's nice.
- Give it a chance, Em.

05:01.074 --> 05:04.543
I-I know
we're gonna love it here.

05:04.545 --> 05:06.845
Let's get you settled in.

05:06.847 --> 05:08.079
Thanks.

05:26.699 --> 05:28.999
No,
it's a very nice surprise.

05:29.001 --> 05:31.670
- This is my daughter, Hannah.

05:57.129 --> 05:59.331
Mum told me you're
into gymnastics and dance.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.067
- But this, this is special.
- Hm.

06:02.069 --> 06:04.201
I'm Hannah, Susan's daughter.
Sorry.

06:04.203 --> 06:06.870
Flight Lieutenant Thompson's
daughter reporting for duty.

06:06.872 --> 06:10.608
Hi, uh, I'm Emma.
It's very nice to meet you.

06:10.610 --> 06:13.345
- So you're a gymnast.
- Um, used to be.

06:13.347 --> 06:16.413
I'm sort of more focused
on cheerleading now.

06:16.415 --> 06:18.083
I'm kinda hoping to do it
while I'm in Australia.

06:18.085 --> 06:19.084
Cheer, huh?

06:19.086 --> 06:20.250
We're not really into it

06:20.252 --> 06:21.418
as much as you Yanks are,

06:21.420 --> 06:23.088
but we'll find something
for you to do.

06:23.090 --> 06:25.389
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

06:25.391 --> 06:27.391
Uh, only the perfect spot
in Adelaide

06:27.393 --> 06:30.060
for an ex hashtag gymnast,
hashtag cheerleader,

06:30.062 --> 06:32.096
hashtag dancer.

06:32.098 --> 06:33.199
Although...

06:34.900 --> 06:36.701
this might not cut it.

06:36.703 --> 06:37.968
Your room's upstairs?

06:37.970 --> 06:39.639
Uh, yeah.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.644
<i>Well, day one,
and already making friends.</i>

06:45.646 --> 06:48.648
<i>It's too bad that making
friends isn't the hard part.</i>

06:50.316 --> 06:52.449
Good. Beautiful.

06:52.451 --> 06:54.689
Point the toes.
Point, point, point.

06:57.157 --> 07:01.059
Well, here it is.
It's not much, but it's us.

07:01.061 --> 07:02.459
Good job.
Straight on to the beam.

07:02.461 --> 07:05.463
Beautiful work. Let's do it.

07:05.465 --> 07:07.331
- You know... Hey!
- Hey, Mia!

07:07.333 --> 07:09.300
Have you met
my new American friend, Emma?

07:09.302 --> 07:11.735
Ooh! Fresh blood.
This should be fun.

07:11.737 --> 07:13.838
Don't be fooled
by Mia's size, okay?

07:13.840 --> 07:15.906
She's the toughest girl I know.

07:15.908 --> 07:17.408
Are you gonna train with us
today?

07:17.410 --> 07:20.144
Uh, yeah. I-I guess I am.

07:20.146 --> 07:21.980
- Cool.
- And that's Issy.

07:21.982 --> 07:24.148
Poor kid,
she was born without a spine.

07:24.150 --> 07:25.417
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.053
See?

07:29.055 --> 07:30.120
<i>Namaste,</i> Emma.

07:30.122 --> 07:32.456
Uh, yeah. <i>Namaste</i> to you.

07:32.458 --> 07:34.324
Issy is just basically a hippie,
you know?

07:34.326 --> 07:36.728
Into yoga, soy...
All of that stuff.

07:36.730 --> 07:38.295
- Okay.
- Hey. Hi, I'm Caitlin.

07:38.297 --> 07:41.132
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- This is our coach, Caitlin.

07:41.134 --> 07:42.466
She was actually
in a great gymnastics team

07:42.468 --> 07:45.370
back in... World War II, was it?

07:45.372 --> 07:48.506
Uh, it was barely 15 years ago,
you little punk.

07:48.508 --> 07:51.242
This is Emma.
She just moved next door.

07:51.244 --> 07:52.843
She's actually a cheerleader
from the States.

07:52.845 --> 07:54.812
So I'm, uh,
secretly trying to recruit her

07:54.814 --> 07:55.846
on to joining our team.

07:55.848 --> 07:57.382
Wait. What?

07:57.384 --> 07:58.783
Oh, didn't I mention that?

07:58.785 --> 08:01.252
Well, we could always use another
member to round out the team.

08:01.254 --> 08:03.254
You wanna show us
what you've got?

08:03.256 --> 08:04.756
Um...

08:04.758 --> 08:06.190
I mean, I wasn't really planning

08:06.192 --> 08:07.992
on jumping in to a team so soon.

08:07.994 --> 08:09.394
Why not?

08:09.396 --> 08:11.829
You'll make friends,
you exercise and...

08:11.831 --> 08:13.131
I don't know,
you can close your eyes

08:13.133 --> 08:14.165
and pretend you're cheerleading.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.834
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

08:15.836 --> 08:17.401
<i>Should I tell her?</i>

08:17.403 --> 08:19.269
<i>Should I say that I don't wanna
make a bunch of friends</i>

08:19.271 --> 08:20.905
<i>that I'll have to leave
in a year?</i>

08:20.907 --> 08:23.307
<i>But she'll understand, right?</i>

08:23.309 --> 08:25.410
Hannah, give the poor girl
some space.

08:25.412 --> 08:27.745
She's probably jet-lagged,
and you guilting her

08:27.747 --> 08:29.346
into joining the team
probably isn't helping.

08:29.348 --> 08:33.183
Geez, you don't have to get
all Mama Bear on us all. Ugh.

08:33.184 --> 08:34.451
Well, why don't you
just stick around?

08:34.453 --> 08:36.287
Watch the girls in action.
No pressure.

08:36.289 --> 08:37.522
- Yeah.
- Come on.

08:37.524 --> 08:39.124
At least join us
for some stretches.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.359
At the very least,
it's gonna be a good workout.

08:41.361 --> 08:43.927
Okay, I mean,
I, I could use a workout.

08:43.929 --> 08:45.929
Excellent.
Well, you guys get stretching.

08:45.931 --> 08:47.999
I'm going to finish off
with the junior squad.

08:48.001 --> 08:50.335
I'm looking forward to seeing
what you can do.

08:50.337 --> 08:51.970
Don't worry. You'll be great.

08:51.972 --> 08:54.172
So, uh, when does
the rest of your team get here?

08:54.174 --> 08:56.039
Uh...

08:56.041 --> 08:57.475
- This is the rest of the team.
- Yeah.

08:57.477 --> 09:01.111
Uh, let's just say
we are in a rebuilding phase.

09:01.113 --> 09:05.015
- A rebuilding phase?
- Yeah.

09:05.017 --> 09:07.152
Uh, a bunch of girls retired
when they went to uni

09:07.154 --> 09:11.822
and we lost a whole bunch
to another team, so...

09:11.824 --> 09:14.328
It happened all at once
and this is us.

09:15.428 --> 09:17.327
Yeah.

09:17.329 --> 09:18.495
Come on.

10:04.077 --> 10:06.977
Nice, Issy, if you hit
your routine just like that

10:06.979 --> 10:09.147
at the state comp this weekend,
you'll be assured a medal.

10:09.149 --> 10:11.249
- Well done.
- Thank you.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.421
- Oops, sorry, guys, wrong music.
- No way.

10:16.423 --> 10:18.155
That's actually the music
that my cheer squad

10:18.157 --> 10:19.557
won championships with.

10:19.559 --> 10:21.359
What? Show us your moves.

10:21.361 --> 10:22.860
Do you guys wanna see
my routine?

10:22.862 --> 10:24.262
- Yeah.
- Let's see what you've got.

10:24.264 --> 10:25.429
Okay. Um, Issy.

10:25.431 --> 10:26.597
Will you start the music
over again?

10:26.599 --> 10:28.131
- Sure thing.
- Look. You know...

10:28.133 --> 10:29.466
It'll look a little weird
without the rest

10:29.468 --> 10:31.668
of the group,
but you'll get the idea.

10:51.357 --> 10:53.357
Issy, can you stop the music?

10:53.359 --> 10:54.692
You're amazing, Em.

10:54.694 --> 10:56.927
We seriously can see
why you're a champ.

10:56.929 --> 10:58.996
Well, thanks.

10:58.998 --> 11:00.431
How about you guys
come up here and join me?

11:00.433 --> 11:02.332
I'll teach this whole thing
to you. It'll be fun.

11:02.334 --> 11:04.335
Issy, why don't you get
right here in the center?

11:04.337 --> 11:08.907
Back there. And then, Hannah
and Mia on either side of her.

11:08.909 --> 11:11.042
Cool. Face this way
towards the mirror.

11:11.044 --> 11:12.710
Yeah. A little more room.

11:12.712 --> 11:14.979
And then
we actually need one more.

11:14.981 --> 11:17.181
So, Caitlin, do you wanna
come in behind Issy?

11:17.183 --> 11:19.116
Me? Uh, no, no, no.

11:19.118 --> 11:21.184
Oh, come on, you dinosaur.

11:21.186 --> 11:22.953
Show us you're not
just a bag of fossils.

11:22.955 --> 11:24.624
Ugh. Okay.

11:26.392 --> 11:28.927
Okay. Issy, you're gonna do
a walkover right in the center.

11:28.929 --> 11:30.294
You two are gonna do
backhand springs.

11:30.296 --> 11:32.330
And make sure you leave yourself
enough room.

11:32.332 --> 11:33.597
Five, six, seven.

11:33.599 --> 11:35.533
One, two, three, four,

11:35.535 --> 11:37.302
five, six, seven, eight.

11:37.304 --> 11:39.037
And you come up.

11:39.039 --> 11:40.404
One, two, three...

11:40.406 --> 11:42.974
Hey, like that.

11:42.976 --> 11:46.076
...two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

11:46.078 --> 11:47.110
Three, four...

11:47.112 --> 11:49.583
Six. Six, seven...

11:51.550 --> 11:52.582
Right foot.

11:52.584 --> 11:56.187
One, two, punch three.

11:56.189 --> 11:58.155
- Straight to eight, that's it.
- All right.

11:58.157 --> 11:59.957
So you're gonna bend your legs
like this.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.059
So you're gonna...
Just like that. Do like that.

12:04.197 --> 12:06.033
I'm supporting you!

12:08.535 --> 12:11.168
Cross your legs over. Make sure
your knees are touching here.

12:11.170 --> 12:12.338
Okay.

12:13.740 --> 12:14.772
...seven, eight.

12:14.774 --> 12:16.506
One, two, three, four,

12:16.508 --> 12:18.543
five, six, seven, eight.

12:18.545 --> 12:20.577
One, two, three, four,

12:20.579 --> 12:22.379
five, six, seven, eight.

12:22.381 --> 12:24.048
One, two, three, four...

12:24.050 --> 12:27.451
<i>Okay, so maybe
this was the opposite</i>

12:27.453 --> 12:29.453
<i>of not joining a squad.</i>

12:29.455 --> 12:31.589
<i>But, I mean, look at them.</i>

12:31.591 --> 12:33.591
<i>It feels good
to be doing some cheer again,</i>

12:33.593 --> 12:36.594
<i>even with a few crazy gymnasts.</i>

12:36.596 --> 12:38.363
Girls, that was amazing.

12:38.365 --> 12:40.465
You bring that sort of energy
to comps, you're gonna smash it.

12:40.467 --> 12:42.499
You'll qualify
for nationals for sure.

12:42.501 --> 12:45.570
We have a comp this weekend.
You should totally come watch.

12:45.572 --> 12:48.575
- Sound good, mate?
- I'll be there, mate.

14:19.265 --> 14:21.131
Uh, excuse me.
I think there's been a mistake.

14:21.133 --> 14:23.100
Hannah didn't go
outside the border.

14:23.102 --> 14:25.135
Yes, she did. It's recorded
clearly right here.

14:25.137 --> 14:27.738
I, I didn't. I-I was close,
but I'm sure I didn't.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.374
Unfortunately, this says you do.
I'm afraid the decision's final.

14:30.376 --> 14:31.542
I didn't go out of bounds.

14:31.544 --> 14:33.543
Please don't argue with me.

14:33.545 --> 14:34.644
The point two deduction stands.

14:34.646 --> 14:36.449
But this isn't fair.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.317
One more word from your gymnast

14:39.319 --> 14:40.750
and you and your team
are red carded.

14:40.752 --> 14:42.055
Okay.

14:43.522 --> 14:46.224
Here's what I think
of your yellow card.

14:50.929 --> 14:53.630
- Do you know those two?
- Well, yeah.

14:53.632 --> 14:56.200
Right. You and your team
are disqualified.

14:56.202 --> 14:59.302
What? No, they-they're
not even a part of our team.

14:59.304 --> 15:00.904
- This can't be serious.
- I know, I know.

15:00.906 --> 15:02.740
- This isn't fair.
- Just leave it, leave it.

15:02.742 --> 15:04.078
I know.

15:07.213 --> 15:09.547
We're disqualified?

15:09.549 --> 15:11.249
Yeah. It was Charlotte and Abi.

15:11.251 --> 15:12.549
I got yellow carded for descent

15:12.551 --> 15:14.184
and then Charlotte water-bombed
the judge

15:14.186 --> 15:15.887
and now we're disqualified.

15:15.889 --> 15:18.155
Why is Charlotte even here?

15:18.157 --> 15:19.789
She isn't even
competing anymore.

15:19.791 --> 15:21.458
You guys know
what Charlotte's like, okay?

15:21.460 --> 15:23.661
She probably did it to see us
fall flat on our face.

15:23.663 --> 15:25.562
Unfortunately,
a red card means

15:25.564 --> 15:27.697
the team misses
the next competition, too.

15:27.699 --> 15:30.668
But that means
no more comps this year.

15:30.670 --> 15:34.371
Yeah. And no chance
to qualify for nationals.

15:34.373 --> 15:35.940
Look,
I'm really sorry, okay?

15:35.942 --> 15:38.442
I know this isn't fair.

15:38.444 --> 15:40.680
Come on.
Let's get our stuff.

15:44.184 --> 15:45.615
It's just not fair.

15:45.617 --> 15:46.752
Hey.

15:48.288 --> 15:50.520
- Who were those girls?
- Charlotte and Abi.

15:50.522 --> 15:52.590
They used to be in our club.

15:52.592 --> 15:55.659
They're really good, Em.
Like, really good.

15:55.661 --> 15:58.562
- And then they left.
- Why?

15:58.564 --> 15:59.964
Years ago
when we went to nationals,

15:59.966 --> 16:02.200
we were certain
we were gonna medal.

16:02.202 --> 16:03.734
Then we came seventh, right?

16:03.736 --> 16:05.302
Charlotte and Abi decided
they didn't wanna be

16:05.304 --> 16:08.371
in a team that couldn't be
champions, so they left,

16:08.373 --> 16:10.707
took a bunch of girls with them
and started a cheer team.

16:10.709 --> 16:12.576
Wait. A-a cheer team?

16:12.578 --> 16:14.312
I thought you guys didn't
really have that here.

16:14.314 --> 16:15.580
They're horrible people, Em.

16:15.582 --> 16:18.282
Like, I am talking, the worst.

16:18.284 --> 16:19.549
You can't be thinking
of cheering with them.

16:19.551 --> 16:22.320
No. No, no, of course not.

16:22.322 --> 16:24.621
I have dealt with girls
like that plenty of times.

16:24.623 --> 16:27.557
They're the last people
you'd wanna be friends with.

16:27.559 --> 16:29.326
I'm really sorry, Hannah.

16:29.328 --> 16:31.428
It's, it's okay.
I mean, it's...

16:31.430 --> 16:33.264
You know what?
It's just disappointing.

16:33.266 --> 16:36.234
I really thought we'd make it
to nationals this year.

16:36.236 --> 16:38.739
Hey. Come on. We got your bag.

16:57.857 --> 17:00.457
Sorry to intrude.
Still recovering from the loss?

17:00.459 --> 17:02.793
Yeah, it's been a rough morning.

17:02.795 --> 17:05.028
Caitlin tried to get
the disqualification appealed,

17:05.030 --> 17:07.464
but it got rejected.

17:07.465 --> 17:08.999
I'll bet you, it was Charlotte's
plan that whole time

17:09.001 --> 17:11.001
to get us disqualified.

17:11.002 --> 17:12.502
You know, next time I see her,

17:12.503 --> 17:13.770
I'm gonna get
one of my redback spiders

17:13.771 --> 17:14.971
and I'm gonna put it
down her back.

17:14.973 --> 17:16.641
I'm not even joking.

17:16.643 --> 17:18.942
I can't believe
we're done for the season.

17:18.944 --> 17:20.711
I wish we could still compete.

17:20.713 --> 17:23.646
Ugh! I just wanna
crush Charlotte into the ground.

17:23.648 --> 17:26.517
- Please.
- Like, is that too much to ask?

17:26.519 --> 17:29.353
<i>And that's when
the idea hit me.</i>

17:29.355 --> 17:31.689
<i>It was perfect.
Everyone would win.</i>

17:31.691 --> 17:33.958
<i>The only problem was,
I knew it would mean</i>

17:33.960 --> 17:36.294
<i>we'd all become a lot closer.</i>

17:36.296 --> 17:39.563
<i>And that would only make it
that much harder to leave.</i>

17:39.565 --> 17:41.865
What if I told you guys

17:41.867 --> 17:43.601
that you could still compete

17:43.603 --> 17:46.369
and get revenge
on Charlotte and Abi?

17:46.371 --> 17:49.707
How? Y...
We're disqualified.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.575
Well, for gymnastics.

17:51.577 --> 17:55.346
But what if we form
our own cheer squad?

17:55.348 --> 17:56.713
I mean, if they're cheerleading,

17:56.715 --> 17:58.749
then there must be competitions,
right?

17:58.751 --> 18:00.951
Well, cheer's just
starting to catch on here,

18:00.953 --> 18:02.420
so there's a few, but...

18:02.422 --> 18:05.556
Okay. Then why can't we
get a team together?

18:05.558 --> 18:07.624
So a cheer team, huh?

18:07.626 --> 18:10.126
Yeah. It's a great way
to keep competing.

18:10.128 --> 18:12.096
Just think of it
exactly like gymnastics,

18:12.098 --> 18:14.365
but with music
and dancing added.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.665
And if we're really good,
it'll be

18:15.667 --> 18:17.434
a new championship
to compete for.

18:17.436 --> 18:19.569
Well, if you're willing
to put in the work, I'm in.

18:19.571 --> 18:22.073
I still think my redback spider
was a solid idea, but...

18:23.443 --> 18:24.909
Okay, okay, first things first.

18:24.911 --> 18:26.977
We do have enough girls here
to form a cheer team,

18:26.979 --> 18:29.145
but if we're trying to compete
against Charlotte at her level,

18:29.147 --> 18:30.347
we'll need more members.

18:30.349 --> 18:32.016
So anybody know

18:32.018 --> 18:33.718
how big her team is?

18:33.720 --> 18:35.752
Well, last time we saw them
cheering at the footy,

18:35.754 --> 18:38.455
there was only like, what,
ten or twelve maybe?

18:38.457 --> 18:39.890
- Yeah.
- Wow. Yeah, that's small.

18:39.892 --> 18:42.660
Any team I've ever been
a part of has been full 24.

18:42.662 --> 18:44.428
Like we said, it's too new,

18:44.430 --> 18:47.064
so all the teams
are still pretty small.

18:47.066 --> 18:48.365
Do you know what level they are?

18:48.367 --> 18:50.101
Um, just became level four.

18:50.103 --> 18:51.801
That's the highest
there is here.

18:51.803 --> 18:53.002
- How the hell do you know that?
- What?

18:53.004 --> 18:55.005
We-we can totally
achieve that.

18:55.007 --> 18:59.743
Oh, wait, uh, also,
we're gonna need uniforms, too.

18:59.745 --> 19:01.778
- It's gonna be a lot of work.
- Well, I'm in.

19:01.780 --> 19:03.847
And I think
I can arrange uniforms.

19:03.849 --> 19:05.449
How about you guys?

19:05.451 --> 19:08.486
- I think it sounds good.
- Okay. All right, everybody in.

19:08.488 --> 19:11.422
Can't let you hog all the glory
without me.

19:11.424 --> 19:14.090
Okay. On three,
everybody say rah!

19:14.092 --> 19:15.893
Wait. Rah?
What is that supposed to mean?

19:15.895 --> 19:17.494
It's a cheerleading thing.

19:17.496 --> 19:18.628
Well, wouldn't something like
cheers be more...

19:18.630 --> 19:19.930
- Just do it, Mia.
- No.

19:19.932 --> 19:21.899
- Okay. Fine.
- Ready?

19:21.901 --> 19:23.933
One, two, three.

19:23.935 --> 19:25.071
- <i>Rah!</i>
- <i>Cheers!</i>

19:27.507 --> 19:30.007
So do you know
what Charlotte's team is like?

19:30.009 --> 19:32.009
I've seem 'em a couple of times.

19:32.011 --> 19:34.077
Not competing,
just at the footy.

19:34.079 --> 19:36.913
All right, they are really good,
you know?

19:36.915 --> 19:40.217
Already won a bunch of trophies,
they've been to nationals.

19:40.219 --> 19:42.588
This might not be
as easy as I thought.

19:45.124 --> 19:47.490
Hey.

19:47.492 --> 19:50.493
Do you really think
we can beat them?

19:50.495 --> 19:52.195
Do they have guys on their team?

19:52.197 --> 19:55.665
Uh, I've never seen any.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.969
If we have guys,
it would be a huge advantage.

19:58.971 --> 20:01.070
We could really
throw some big stunts.

20:01.072 --> 20:03.874
Anything to smash
Charlotte and Abi.

20:03.876 --> 20:06.644
You know, if you wanna
scope out the competition,

20:06.646 --> 20:08.979
Charlotte's gonna be cheering
at the footy game tomorrow.

20:08.981 --> 20:12.215
- Oh, football. I love football.
- Uh, Aussie rules?

20:12.217 --> 20:14.718
Oh, is that like rugby?

20:14.720 --> 20:18.221
Not quite. It's also not
cricket, soccer or field hockey.

20:18.223 --> 20:21.090
Well, just come with me, okay?
You're gonna love it.

20:21.092 --> 20:23.493

Hey.

20:49.588 --> 20:51.689
I see you've already met Ethan.

20:51.691 --> 20:53.723

21:03.069 --> 21:06.269

21:06.271 --> 21:08.705

21:08.707 --> 21:10.708
Wow, they're good.

21:10.710 --> 21:12.876
Good?

21:12.878 --> 21:15.080
Well, but we'll be better.

21:29.028 --> 21:31.327
I have to admit,
I had an ulterior motive

21:31.329 --> 21:32.762
in bringing you here.

21:32.764 --> 21:34.800
Keep your eye
on number 18, okay?

21:45.677 --> 21:47.611
- Oh, wow. Yeah.
- Good, right?

21:47.613 --> 21:50.647
That's Liam,
the best player on the team.

21:50.649 --> 21:52.819
Maybe a nice little addition
to ours.

21:55.721 --> 21:57.354
Look, gals,
Hannah's decided

21:57.356 --> 22:00.223
to give up gymnastics
and join the footy team.

22:00.225 --> 22:01.759
It really does suit you better.

22:01.761 --> 22:03.027
You guys will fit right in

22:03.029 --> 22:04.961
with the rest
of the footy meatheads.

22:04.963 --> 22:06.963
Hey. Let her talk.

22:06.965 --> 22:09.365
She'll be eating all of
her insults before she knows it.

22:09.367 --> 22:10.701
What is she talking about?

22:10.703 --> 22:12.635
We're starting a cheer team.

22:12.637 --> 22:14.971
Emma here is our secret weapon.

22:14.973 --> 22:17.641
You start a cheer team?

22:17.643 --> 22:19.609
Wow, I mean, I know

22:19.611 --> 22:21.045
you're, like,
totally obsessed with me,

22:21.047 --> 22:23.814
but this is starting to get
creepy. Don't you think?

22:23.816 --> 22:25.281
Aw, that's so cute.

22:25.283 --> 22:28.852
They actually think
they can compete against us.

22:28.854 --> 22:31.321
Come on, then.
Show us what you've got.

22:31.323 --> 22:33.057
What? Here?

22:33.059 --> 22:35.692
- Like, right now?
- Oh, unless you're scared.

22:35.694 --> 22:38.796
I mean, Hannah did foul
the gym comp, so...

22:38.798 --> 22:41.131
What can I say if we just think
that we're better than her?

22:41.133 --> 22:42.569
Well, that's enough.

22:43.935 --> 22:45.237
You ready?

22:46.238 --> 22:47.874
Let's do this.

24:51.731 --> 24:54.865
Nice try, but looks like
your team loses.

24:54.867 --> 24:56.767
Again.

24:56.769 --> 24:59.169
Let us know when you graduate
from the Junior League

24:59.171 --> 25:00.903
and can actually cheer.

25:10.382 --> 25:12.415
Honestly, say the word

25:12.417 --> 25:14.884
and I'll put a funnel-web spider
in her locker.

25:14.886 --> 25:18.922
What? I'm into spiders.

25:18.924 --> 25:20.524
As tempting as that sounds,

25:20.526 --> 25:22.025
all we need to do
is up our game

25:22.027 --> 25:24.127
and we'll smash them
in the championships.

25:24.129 --> 25:27.530
Sorry, Mia and I have to go.
Good luck with recruiting.

25:27.532 --> 25:28.734
See ya.

25:30.502 --> 25:32.236
Look, we need guys.

25:32.238 --> 25:34.441
At the very least,
we have to get Liam.

25:37.342 --> 25:39.242
Hey, Liam. Great win.

25:39.244 --> 25:40.810
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Congrats.

25:40.812 --> 25:42.980
I've never seen footy before.

25:42.982 --> 25:45.848
Oh, sorry. Hi. I'm Emma. I just
moved here from the States.

25:45.850 --> 25:48.585
Ah. Hi, I'm, I'm Liam.

25:48.587 --> 25:51.587
Well, Emma, I'm glad I could
introduce you to the sport.

25:51.589 --> 25:53.190
Yes, she's only been here
for a couple of days

25:53.192 --> 25:54.991
and she's already
shaking things up.

25:54.993 --> 25:57.861
Did you hear we actually changed
our gym team to a cheer team?

25:57.863 --> 26:00.830
- Um, no.
- Uh, well, we did.

26:00.832 --> 26:03.267
And now we're lookin'
for some extra members.

26:03.269 --> 26:04.433
We could really use
a couple of guys.

26:04.435 --> 26:05.568
Yeah.

26:05.570 --> 26:08.005
Maybe someone with...

26:08.007 --> 26:10.440
I don't know, killer backflip.

26:10.442 --> 26:12.976
Mm.

26:12.978 --> 26:14.981
Well, you're not serious. I...

26:17.015 --> 26:18.080
Yeah.

26:18.082 --> 26:20.083
Me cheerleading?

26:20.085 --> 26:22.819
Do you have any idea what kind
of flak I'd cut from the guys?

26:22.821 --> 26:24.520
Well, just think of it like

26:24.522 --> 26:26.522
footy and gymnastics.

26:26.524 --> 26:28.826
Except, you know,
with a bunch of cute girls.

26:28.828 --> 26:30.193
- Mm.
- Hm.

26:30.195 --> 26:32.863
Liam,
we did gym together for years.

26:32.865 --> 26:34.364
Okay, I will just tell my mum

26:34.366 --> 26:35.833
to tell your mum
to make you do it.

26:35.835 --> 26:37.971
So you might as well
give in now.

26:40.105 --> 26:42.175
All right. I'll think about it.

26:48.047 --> 26:51.080
- Well, it wasn't a no.
- Don't worry.

26:51.082 --> 26:53.482
I'll push his buttons to make
sure he actually wants to do it.

26:53.484 --> 26:56.286
Trust me. Just leave it with me.

26:56.288 --> 26:58.555
All right,
so, uh, that's one down.

26:58.557 --> 27:00.356
- Let's go.
- Wait. Where are we going?

27:00.358 --> 27:02.194
To recruit our next member.

27:03.494 --> 27:05.895
It's very exciting.

27:05.897 --> 27:08.067
I'm sure you'll love it.
Get in.

27:12.570 --> 27:14.037
Our next member's in here?

27:14.039 --> 27:15.607
Yup. Right there.

27:19.878 --> 27:21.144
Hm. I don't know.

27:21.146 --> 27:22.980
She doesn't really look

27:22.982 --> 27:25.249
like the cheerleading type.

27:25.251 --> 27:26.549
Judge not, my friend.

27:26.551 --> 27:28.317
Tilds used to be
in the gymnastics team

27:28.319 --> 27:30.621
until she had a little bit
of a falling out.

27:30.623 --> 27:32.923
But I think she'll be very keen

27:32.925 --> 27:35.028
to give us a shot, all right?

27:40.366 --> 27:42.335
Hannah. What are you doing here?

27:43.269 --> 27:44.500
Who's the Girl Scout?

27:44.502 --> 27:46.236
She's no Girl Scout.
This is Emma.

27:46.238 --> 27:49.439
One of the best dancers
I have ever seen.

27:49.441 --> 27:51.208
- Oh, yeah?
- And, uh...

27:51.210 --> 27:54.144
We're looking for another really
great dancer to join our team.

27:54.146 --> 27:56.078
Didn't I hear
you guys got disqualified?

27:56.080 --> 27:58.147
Uh, that was for gymnastics,

27:58.149 --> 28:01.151
but we're forming a cheer squad.

28:01.153 --> 28:04.721
I'm not exactly
the cheering type.

28:04.723 --> 28:07.057
Look, Tilds,
you're an awesome dancer.

28:07.059 --> 28:09.593
And, plus, we could really use
your help with the choreography.

28:09.595 --> 28:13.630
But cheer
is just so mainstream.

28:13.632 --> 28:15.097
I don't think so.

28:15.099 --> 28:17.433
Okay. Well,
if that's how you feel...

28:17.435 --> 28:18.605
Wait, wait.

28:19.538 --> 28:22.071
- What?
- Ah.

28:22.073 --> 28:23.673
Did I mention the part
that we'll be competing

28:23.675 --> 28:25.976
against Charlotte and Abi?

28:25.978 --> 28:28.114
Charlotte and Abi?

28:29.514 --> 28:31.448
What's she talking about,
Girl Scout?

28:31.450 --> 28:34.151
Well, the, the plan is
to face off against them

28:34.153 --> 28:35.952
at the state championships.

28:35.954 --> 28:37.287
And, and then, then

28:37.289 --> 28:39.056
totally just destroy them.

28:39.058 --> 28:40.624
- Yeah.
- With our routine.

28:40.626 --> 28:43.663
Just humiliate them,
cause, well, lots of tears.

28:44.762 --> 28:46.496
You guys good?

28:46.498 --> 28:49.031
- Of course, we're good.
- Yeah, we're really good.

28:49.033 --> 28:53.502
Well, congratulations
'cause now you'll be great.

28:53.504 --> 28:55.705
- I'm in.
- All right.

28:55.707 --> 28:58.008
The training's Monday
and Wednesdays at the gym.

28:58.010 --> 28:59.412
I'll be there.

29:05.317 --> 29:07.017
Okay.

29:07.019 --> 29:08.986
What's with the whole
Charlotte and Abi thing?

29:08.988 --> 29:10.186
What was up
with all that?

29:10.188 --> 29:12.055
I'll let Tilds
explain it to you.

29:12.057 --> 29:13.289
We have another member
to recruit

29:13.291 --> 29:14.458
before we can call it a day.

29:14.460 --> 29:15.491
Care to tell me what

29:15.493 --> 29:16.692
the plan is this time?

29:16.694 --> 29:18.494
What's the fun in that?

29:18.496 --> 29:20.230
Let's just say,
we're gonna make her an offer

29:20.232 --> 29:21.798
she can't refuse.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.066
Oh, wow, you're not in, like,

29:23.068 --> 29:26.369
the Australian mafia, are you?

29:26.371 --> 29:28.206
Why do you have to be
so cryptic?

29:30.341 --> 29:32.174
Seriously?

29:32.176 --> 29:35.278
- Belly dancing?
- Oh, very serious.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.813
Watch and learn.

29:36.815 --> 29:38.647
Okay.

29:38.649 --> 29:40.784
And what about this offer
she can't refuse?

29:40.786 --> 29:42.618
Sorry, no spoilers.

29:42.620 --> 29:46.059
But when I point to you,
just say, Liam.

29:47.059 --> 29:50.227
What? Liam? Wait. Hannah.

30:00.039 --> 30:02.241
Hannah, what are you doing here?

30:03.575 --> 30:06.209
Actually, came to see you.
This is Emma.

30:06.211 --> 30:08.345
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

30:08.347 --> 30:10.047
Em's convinced us
to start a cheer team.

30:10.049 --> 30:12.149
And we just thought
you'd be perfect for it.

30:12.151 --> 30:13.349
Oh, that's awesome.

30:13.351 --> 30:15.419
I'm sorry, look,
I'm really flattered,

30:15.421 --> 30:17.788
but I'm taking
12 hours of dance a week.

30:17.790 --> 30:20.123
I don't have the bandwidth
to add anything else.

30:20.125 --> 30:23.559
Such a pity. We're trying to get
the old gang back together.

30:23.561 --> 30:26.232
You know, Mia, Issy, Tilds.

30:27.398 --> 30:28.765
Uh, Liam.

30:28.767 --> 30:31.300
Liam? How is he?

30:31.302 --> 30:33.502
Wait, has he said anything
about me?

30:33.504 --> 30:36.573
I mean, wait, sorry.
Forget I asked, um...

30:36.575 --> 30:38.374
He's gonna cheer with you guys?

30:38.376 --> 30:41.644
We hope so.
He seemed interested.

30:41.646 --> 30:43.113
Why? Are you guys friends?

30:43.115 --> 30:46.182
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

30:46.184 --> 30:48.484
Em, you didn't know.
They used to date.

30:48.486 --> 30:50.586
- They made a great couple, too.
- Oh.

30:50.588 --> 30:52.655
Ah, I feel so stupid.

30:52.657 --> 30:55.092
I mean, I didn't even think
how you would feel,

30:55.094 --> 30:56.692
you know,
spending so much time with him.

30:56.694 --> 30:59.462
The possibility
of feelings resurfacing,

30:59.464 --> 31:01.565
passions flaring.

31:01.567 --> 31:04.634
- Oh.
- No, that would be unfortunate.

31:11.109 --> 31:13.509
You told them
when to come to practice, right?

31:13.511 --> 31:15.714
Yeah,
they should be here any minute.

31:16.682 --> 31:18.115
Hopefully.

31:18.117 --> 31:20.383
Wait.

31:20.385 --> 31:22.652
You invited her to join?

31:22.654 --> 31:24.421
- Is there a problem?
- Are you kidding me?

31:24.423 --> 31:26.455
Tilds is the worst.

31:26.457 --> 31:29.226
Tilds and Mia
had, like, this falling out,

31:29.228 --> 31:30.559
back when
they were on the same team.

31:30.561 --> 31:32.130
Hm.

31:33.531 --> 31:35.132
Hey, pip squeak.

31:35.134 --> 31:36.199
I didn't know
this team are letting

31:36.201 --> 31:37.767
little kiddies compete.

31:37.769 --> 31:39.137
Ow!

31:40.539 --> 31:41.872
Hey, coach. Warm-up?

31:41.874 --> 31:43.606
Yeah,
you know the drill.

31:46.944 --> 31:48.345
- Go the other way.
- No.

31:48.347 --> 31:49.882
- Yes, cooperate.
- No.

31:52.518 --> 31:54.483
Oh, am I early?
Is everyone here?

31:54.485 --> 31:57.522
We got some stragglers.
You know boys.

31:59.191 --> 32:00.193
At least I hope so.

32:03.662 --> 32:05.595
Hey, Liam,
nice to see you.

32:05.597 --> 32:08.230
You can drop your stuff.
Join in the warm-up.

32:08.232 --> 32:10.403
- I told you.
- Hm.

32:18.409 --> 32:19.611
Amahli.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.778
Hey, Liam.

32:22.780 --> 32:24.580
I heard you might join the team.

32:24.582 --> 32:27.317
Really? And you still came?

32:27.319 --> 32:28.652
Yeah.

32:28.654 --> 32:29.952
Well, I'm glad you're here.

32:29.954 --> 32:31.887
For the team.

32:31.889 --> 32:33.856
- Not because I'm...
- Okay!

32:33.858 --> 32:37.460
I think we're warm. Um,
do you guys wanna get started?

32:37.462 --> 32:39.429
Okay, sounds good.

32:39.431 --> 32:41.631
All right, guys, I'm
super excited to have you here.

32:41.633 --> 32:44.201
This cheerleading thing
is a little bit new to me,

32:44.203 --> 32:46.435
so I'm gonna coach you
through your gymnastics moves,

32:46.437 --> 32:49.205
but Emma will lead the routines.
All right?

32:49.207 --> 32:51.343
- Emma, you're up.
- All right.

32:54.346 --> 32:57.513
<i>So maybe our team was
a little rough around the edges</i>

32:57.515 --> 32:59.915
<i>and there was some tension
already bubbling,</i>

32:59.917 --> 33:02.751
<i>but we had a lot of raw talent
out on the floor.</i>

33:02.753 --> 33:06.222
<i>It just needed to be molded
into one cohesive squad.</i>

33:06.224 --> 33:07.590
Okay, guys, look.

33:07.592 --> 33:11.196
I've been a part
of a lot of cheer teams.

33:11.963 --> 33:13.462
But I feel like

33:13.464 --> 33:16.266
this one has the potential
to be the best.

33:16.268 --> 33:18.234
I feel like
we could go to nationals.

33:18.236 --> 33:20.336
So why don't we start
by getting in formation?

33:20.338 --> 33:21.671
Follow me.

33:21.673 --> 33:23.006
- Okay, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

33:23.008 --> 33:24.574
We're gonna start with this,

33:24.576 --> 33:25.874
and you step forward.

33:25.876 --> 33:28.010
Go out, two.

33:28.012 --> 33:30.946
In three. Four.

33:38.790 --> 33:40.022
Five, six, seven, eight.

33:40.024 --> 33:42.625
Oh, my God!

33:42.627 --> 33:44.429
Great work.

33:47.065 --> 33:50.066
Okay, so we still
don't have enough members

33:50.068 --> 33:52.335
to properly compete,
so if you know anyone,

33:52.337 --> 33:53.905
it'd be a huge help.

33:54.940 --> 33:56.509
Anyone? Really?

33:58.777 --> 34:01.678
You know, we could really use
another guy

34:01.680 --> 34:05.448
to help with formations
and stunt groups.

34:05.450 --> 34:07.416
Well, Liam,
you got any jock friends

34:07.418 --> 34:10.289
willing to spend weeknights
with a bunch of girls?

34:13.492 --> 34:15.524
I actually might.

34:15.525 --> 34:17.592
Meet me at the Blue Eagles
soccer pitch grandstand at 3:00

34:17.594 --> 34:19.529
on Saturday.

34:19.531 --> 34:22.598
I reckon I know just the guy.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.875
So what are we doing here?

34:31.877 --> 34:33.478
Just wait and see.

34:36.614 --> 34:39.581
It was nice seeing Amahli
at the practice yesterday.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.949
Though it was a little awkward.

34:41.952 --> 34:44.420
That's what happens
when you jilt someone, big guy.

34:45.824 --> 34:48.558
I don't know, it seemed
like you guys were getting along.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.328
Maybe she was just nervous
about joining a new team.

34:51.330 --> 34:52.661
Yeah, maybe.

34:54.431 --> 34:56.031
But she looked amazing.

34:56.033 --> 34:57.801
Just don't stuff it up
this time, yeah?

34:57.803 --> 34:59.868
Yeah, I won't.

34:59.870 --> 35:01.604
Amahli's pretty special,

35:01.606 --> 35:04.341
but I don't think
she's ever gonna forgive me

35:04.343 --> 35:05.711
for bailing on her.

35:08.412 --> 35:10.346
Well, when they were dating,

35:10.348 --> 35:12.615
Liam was meant to be
in a salsa demo with Amahli

35:12.617 --> 35:14.017
at the school formal.

35:14.019 --> 35:16.151
And it was, like,
a really big deal for her.

35:16.153 --> 35:19.421
- And he didn't show.
- What happened?

35:19.423 --> 35:21.924
Amahli had to drop out.
She didn't have a partner.

35:23.627 --> 35:25.428
She must have felt horrible.

35:25.430 --> 35:27.596
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:27.598 --> 35:29.832
I just got so self-conscious.

35:29.834 --> 35:32.368
And, well,
I was never that good at it.

35:32.370 --> 35:34.437
The guys were giving me
such a hard time,

35:34.439 --> 35:38.375
so I just, I just panicked.

35:38.377 --> 35:39.879
I didn't even call her.

35:41.412 --> 35:42.447
Hm.

35:44.149 --> 35:47.953
Well, maybe it's not too late.

35:49.687 --> 35:50.854
It just so happens,

35:50.856 --> 35:53.957
I won junior championship
in salsa

35:53.959 --> 35:56.125
when I was younger.

35:56.127 --> 35:57.861
Maybe I could teach you
a few things.

35:57.863 --> 36:00.029
You could surprise Amahli.

36:00.031 --> 36:02.165
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:02.167 --> 36:05.801
That's what friends are for.

36:05.803 --> 36:08.203
<i>There was that word
again. Friends.</i>

36:08.205 --> 36:10.439
<i>I guess there's no denying it.</i>

36:10.441 --> 36:12.508
<i>I'm getting in deeper now.</i>

36:12.510 --> 36:14.611
Well, here comes our guy now.

36:28.459 --> 36:30.225
Wow! He's good.

36:30.227 --> 36:32.962
But I mean, how does
this translate to cheer?

36:32.964 --> 36:34.166
Just watch.

36:35.801 --> 36:38.167
I did not know
Ethan could do that.

36:38.169 --> 36:39.504
See that?

36:47.044 --> 36:48.444
So I used to compete against him

36:48.446 --> 36:49.979
in gymnastics
when we were younger.

36:49.981 --> 36:51.513
Okay.

36:51.515 --> 36:52.881
But something tells me

36:52.883 --> 36:55.451
he'll be quite eager
to start it up again.

36:55.453 --> 36:57.823
- Mm.
- Mm.

36:59.156 --> 37:00.957
- Oh, hi. Emma, right?
- Yeah.

37:00.959 --> 37:02.725
It's-it's really great
to see you.

37:02.727 --> 37:06.662
- Thanks for comin' out to watch.
- It was my pleasure.

37:06.664 --> 37:08.798
Uh, I mean, it was, uh,
it was, it was our pleasure.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.767
It wasn't just mine.

37:10.769 --> 37:15.040
Yeah, we'd love to come
and cheer on the team, don't we?

37:16.975 --> 37:20.542
Wasn't there something
you wanted to ask Ethan?

37:20.544 --> 37:22.111
Yes. Right.

37:22.113 --> 37:24.214
Yeah, I was just,
I was wondering if, uh,

37:24.216 --> 37:26.582
you know, you're not too busy
or anything,

37:26.584 --> 37:28.618
if, uh, you know,

37:28.620 --> 37:31.690
you had any interest at all...

37:33.057 --> 37:35.058
Will you join
our cheerleading squad?

37:37.062 --> 37:39.595
Uh, that's what
you wanted to ask me...

37:39.597 --> 37:43.899
Uh, yeah,
I mean, cheerleading.

37:43.901 --> 37:46.703
- Um, do guys even do that?
- Liam does.

37:50.040 --> 37:53.011
- Are you on the team?
- Emma's pretty much the captain.

37:54.879 --> 37:56.546
Yeah, maybe I'll come
check it out.

37:56.548 --> 37:58.247
I'll text you Emma's number

37:58.249 --> 38:00.683
and she can send you
the details.

38:00.685 --> 38:02.852
Uh, no, it's, it's fine.
It's really not necessary.

38:02.854 --> 38:05.154
- Already done.
- Uh, great.

38:05.156 --> 38:07.193
Text Emma
if you wanna join, okay?

38:08.693 --> 38:10.660
Sounds good.

38:10.662 --> 38:12.060
Take care, Emma.

38:12.062 --> 38:13.665
Bye.

38:14.665 --> 38:17.299
Oh!

38:17.301 --> 38:19.334
Oh, my God.

38:19.336 --> 38:21.537
Hey, Liam, can you just close
Emma's mouth?

38:21.539 --> 38:22.738
- She's drooling a little.
- Okay.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.140
All right, all right,
all right, yes.

38:24.142 --> 38:26.743
Stop. I think he's cute.
Okay, we get it.

38:26.745 --> 38:28.310
Can we please not be children
about this?

38:28.312 --> 38:30.178
- Thank you.
- Well, mwah, mwah.

38:36.955 --> 38:37.953
Hm.

38:37.955 --> 38:39.354
- Hey there, kid.
- Hey.

38:39.356 --> 38:40.924
Have a good day?

38:40.926 --> 38:43.125
Yeah. I guess
you could say that.

38:43.127 --> 38:44.894
Good, good
'cause I got some great news.

38:44.896 --> 38:47.830
I've just been waitin'
for the right time to tell ya.

38:47.832 --> 38:50.767
<i>Oh, no.
He's said that before.</i>

38:50.769 --> 38:52.368
<i>And it almost always means...</i>

38:52.370 --> 38:54.169
I think
we're gettin' out of here early.

38:54.171 --> 38:56.872
<i>Yup. Called it.</i>

38:56.874 --> 38:59.042
My superior officer
in California is transferring

38:59.044 --> 39:01.280
and, um,
they offered me the job.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.580
If I take the promotion,

39:04.582 --> 39:06.952
well, we might be able
to stay in California for good.

39:09.620 --> 39:10.756
Em?

39:12.856 --> 39:16.292
Do you know
how long it would be?

39:16.294 --> 39:19.328
I-I mean, just because,
you know, my friends and I,

39:19.330 --> 39:21.397
the-the squad,

39:21.399 --> 39:23.765
we're trying to compete
at the state championships.

39:23.767 --> 39:26.336
It-it won't be for a few months,
so you still get to compete,

39:26.338 --> 39:28.404
but the thing is
we won't be here

39:28.406 --> 39:30.906
for the 12 months
that we thought.

39:30.908 --> 39:33.343
You get to go back
to your friends.

39:33.345 --> 39:35.278
Isn't that great?

39:35.280 --> 39:38.615
<i>No, as always,
it's the worst timing.</i>

39:38.617 --> 39:41.750
<i>I'm not ready
to say goodbye again.</i>

39:41.752 --> 39:44.886
It'll be like we never left.

39:44.888 --> 39:46.258
Just you and me, right?

39:49.426 --> 39:51.026
Right.

40:01.906 --> 40:04.374
About time, captain.
Some of us have stuff to do.

40:04.376 --> 40:06.709
I'm sorry, guys.
Is this everybody?

40:06.711 --> 40:08.781
Oh, we're just waiting on Ethan.

40:12.716 --> 40:13.982
Do you think he'll come?

40:13.984 --> 40:16.451
Don't worry,
you smitten little kitten.

40:16.453 --> 40:17.622
He'll be here.

40:19.057 --> 40:21.225
Okay.

40:24.028 --> 40:25.164
Hey.

40:28.133 --> 40:29.301
Told you.

40:31.903 --> 40:34.770
<i>Okay.
Get it together, Em.</i>

40:34.772 --> 40:37.140
<i>If we're gonna win,
they need a leader.</i>

40:37.142 --> 40:38.408
<i>Just don't think about leaving</i>

40:38.410 --> 40:41.743
<i>and everything will be fine.</i>

40:41.745 --> 40:45.048
All right,
let's get down to business.

40:58.396 --> 40:59.631
Up!

41:04.102 --> 41:05.767
Have you told anyone else
you're doing this?

41:05.769 --> 41:08.437
No way. And what about you?

41:08.439 --> 41:12.375
Same as you. Less people that
know about this, the better.

41:12.377 --> 41:14.413
Well, Em is pretty awesome.

41:15.513 --> 41:17.245
Yeah.

41:17.247 --> 41:19.818
You-you know, I think she's
keen on me, actually, yeah.

41:24.823 --> 41:26.022
- Just like that.
- Yeah.

41:26.024 --> 41:28.327
Out. Straighten it.

41:35.800 --> 41:39.468
- No, no...
- What? Wait, what?

41:39.470 --> 41:42.171
<i>Everything is going
so great,</i>

41:42.173 --> 41:45.006
<i>but we still need
a couple more team members.</i>

41:45.008 --> 41:47.780
- This way.
- Nice.

41:51.548 --> 41:53.515
- Hi.
- Oh, Ethan, hey.

41:53.517 --> 41:56.051
Uh, if you're lookin' for Liam,
I think he already left.

41:56.053 --> 41:58.122
No, I was actually
waiting for you.

41:59.957 --> 42:03.825
No, I was wondering, maybe you
wanted to hang out tomorrow?

42:03.827 --> 42:06.028
Like, just the two of us.

42:06.030 --> 42:08.230
Oh, like a...

42:08.232 --> 42:11.399
- Like, a date?
- Whoa.

42:11.401 --> 42:13.169
<i>You heard what dad said.</i>

42:13.171 --> 42:17.073
<i>We're leaving in a few months.
Don't get too attached.</i>

42:17.075 --> 42:18.274
<i>Let him down gently.</i>

42:18.276 --> 42:19.575
Look, I promise you.

42:19.577 --> 42:21.109
If nothing else,

42:21.111 --> 42:24.814
it'll be fun and informational.

42:24.816 --> 42:28.250
"Fun and informational."

42:28.252 --> 42:31.787
That sounds romantic.

42:31.789 --> 42:35.057
- What do you say?
- What did you have in mind?

42:42.901 --> 42:44.299
Oh, this is so cool,
I've never seen

42:44.301 --> 42:46.035
an albino kangaroo before.

42:46.037 --> 42:47.138
Yeah.

42:54.111 --> 42:56.178
Just keep him
nice and low for me.

42:56.180 --> 42:58.816
- Okay.
- Stay nice and still.

43:02.053 --> 43:04.086
He's so cute.

43:04.088 --> 43:06.225
I'm so excited right now,
you have no idea.

43:11.062 --> 43:13.365
Oh! I'm sorry about that.

43:16.334 --> 43:17.469
Oi.

43:21.104 --> 43:23.242
So it was, like, a legit date?

43:24.475 --> 43:27.142
- I guess.
- It was?

43:27.144 --> 43:28.877
You're gonna break
the poor boy's heart

43:28.879 --> 43:30.446
if you leave in a year.

43:30.448 --> 43:31.917
Yeah.

43:33.117 --> 43:35.151
Hey, so, uh, remind me again,

43:35.153 --> 43:36.218
what are we doing here?

43:36.220 --> 43:38.356
Oh, just follow my lead.

43:40.524 --> 43:42.160
Hannah! Ugh!

43:43.127 --> 43:44.429
Every time.

43:52.069 --> 43:53.502
Hi, girls. Are you here
to see the mayor?

43:53.504 --> 43:55.136
- Yes. Yeah.
- She'll be right with you.

43:55.138 --> 43:57.540
- Please take a seat.
- Lovely. Thank you.

43:59.042 --> 44:01.076
- The mayor?
- Uh-huh.

44:01.078 --> 44:03.245
You still haven't told me
why we're here.

44:03.247 --> 44:06.482
It was a pleasure
speaking with you, girls.

44:06.484 --> 44:10.118
Hello, Hannah. And you must be
Emma, the American.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.654
- Lovely to meet you.
- Hi.

44:11.656 --> 44:14.890
I've had a chance to review
your request for funding.

44:14.892 --> 44:17.560
Charlotte and Abi have also
asked me to fund their team.

44:17.562 --> 44:19.294
I'm afraid we can't fund
two teams

44:19.296 --> 44:20.595
within such close proximity

44:20.597 --> 44:22.665
in our council area.

44:22.667 --> 44:24.933
So, uh, w-what does this mean?

44:24.935 --> 44:27.169
I was going to present
the documentation

44:27.171 --> 44:29.037
from both squads
and put it to a vote,

44:29.039 --> 44:30.605
but Abi's had rather...

44:30.607 --> 44:32.274
It was Charlotte.

44:32.276 --> 44:34.042
Oh, was it? Oh.

44:34.044 --> 44:36.912
Charlotte suggested
the council support the team

44:36.914 --> 44:39.482
who wins the state championship.

44:39.484 --> 44:41.250
We're a new team, though.

44:41.252 --> 44:43.618
We're gonna need funding
to even compete.

44:43.620 --> 44:46.288
Well, as Charlotte and Abi
pointed out,

44:46.290 --> 44:48.323
Coreega Gymnastics has received

44:48.325 --> 44:50.158
a great deal of funding
over the years,

44:50.160 --> 44:52.928
and I think you'll agree
it's only reasonable

44:52.930 --> 44:54.397
that the council
should support the team

44:54.399 --> 44:55.964
who will best represent
our area.

44:55.966 --> 44:57.933
- But...
- Good, it's settled.

44:57.935 --> 44:59.734
Whoever achieves
the highest result

44:59.736 --> 45:01.537
in the state championships

45:01.539 --> 45:03.038
will receive council funding.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.339
Thank you, girls.

45:04.341 --> 45:06.345
I must move
to my next appointment.

45:08.146 --> 45:09.578
You know, Emma,
it's not too late

45:09.580 --> 45:12.247
to join a championship team.

45:12.249 --> 45:14.283
Maybe it's time
you ditched the losers.

45:14.285 --> 45:16.252
We'll see who the losers are.

45:16.254 --> 45:19.087
Suit yourselves.

45:19.089 --> 45:21.126
Don't say we didn't offer.

45:24.495 --> 45:26.194
She drives me nuts.

45:26.196 --> 45:27.763
Seriously, I just wish
Mia was here or something

45:27.765 --> 45:30.035
just to throw a spider at her.

45:31.602 --> 45:32.971
This is good.

45:33.671 --> 45:36.439
How do you figure that?

45:36.441 --> 45:37.740
Hannah, do you not see
that Charlotte's

45:37.742 --> 45:40.176
tryin' to stop us
from competing?

45:40.178 --> 45:43.245
If we weren't a threat,
why would they even bother?

45:43.247 --> 45:44.779
I guess.

45:44.781 --> 45:47.582
But how are we
even gonna compete?

45:47.584 --> 45:49.551
Right, we don't
even have uniforms.

45:49.553 --> 45:51.120
We can't even afford to pay

45:51.122 --> 45:52.654
our entrance fee
for the competition.

45:52.656 --> 45:55.126
Well, we're not giving up.
Okay?

45:56.560 --> 45:59.261
I know a guaranteed way
to make some money.

45:59.263 --> 46:02.263
It has worked with every squad
I have ever been a part of.

46:14.144 --> 46:16.444
So this was your big idea?

46:16.446 --> 46:20.116
I don't get it. A car wash
and barbecue always works.

46:20.118 --> 46:21.283
Yeah, I'm actually surprised

46:21.285 --> 46:22.718
our incredible team dynamic

46:22.720 --> 46:24.352
isn't doing the charm.

46:24.354 --> 46:26.455
Guys, stop, come on.
Just give it to her.

46:26.457 --> 46:28.193
You're not children.

46:33.397 --> 46:36.432
Okay, so we've already
washed my car three times now,

46:36.434 --> 46:39.834
trying to inspire someone
to pull in.

46:39.836 --> 46:41.136
What's the total?

46:41.138 --> 46:43.071
Well, factoring the cost

46:43.073 --> 46:44.774
of the food and supplies,

46:44.776 --> 46:47.042
we've managed to break even.

46:47.044 --> 46:48.444
So no uniforms,

46:48.446 --> 46:51.212
but we can buy a Magaschoni.

46:51.214 --> 46:53.149
Great.

46:53.151 --> 46:55.283
And where have they been?

46:55.285 --> 46:58.087
I don't know.
Footy or training or something.

46:58.089 --> 47:00.423
How's it goin'?
You makin' heaps?

47:00.425 --> 47:02.691
No, not good, we even put Issy
out in the front

47:02.693 --> 47:04.692
in one of her poses
to attract people and...

47:04.694 --> 47:06.798
That's not working, either.

47:08.832 --> 47:10.466
We gotta do something.

47:10.468 --> 47:12.571
Yeah. Yeah, this is pretty sad.

47:14.338 --> 47:16.705
I've got an idea.

47:16.707 --> 47:18.506
Let's go.

47:18.508 --> 47:20.508
- I got an idea, too.
- Where are you going?

47:20.510 --> 47:22.444
- Oi, come back.
- Wait, hey!

47:22.446 --> 47:24.580
Hey, where you go...
We might need that bucket.

47:24.582 --> 47:26.549
When all of our customers
pour in.

47:40.330 --> 47:42.099
Insurance and incentive.

47:43.734 --> 47:45.600
Your turn
at the footy club.

47:45.602 --> 47:47.703
- Hey, guys. How you going?
- Hi, guys.

47:47.705 --> 47:49.370
Heard you needed
some help.

47:49.372 --> 47:51.573
Brought the boys along
to assist.

47:51.575 --> 47:52.774
- All right.
- All right.

47:55.912 --> 47:57.648
- How you doin'?
- Real good. Thanks.

48:00.350 --> 48:02.151
Can we help?

48:02.153 --> 48:04.386
Uh, with our fundraiser? Sure.

48:04.388 --> 48:07.189
I'm Bec, that's Millie,
Rachel and Will.

48:07.191 --> 48:09.225
- Emma.
- Yeah, we know.

48:09.227 --> 48:11.326
We heard about your cheer team.

48:11.328 --> 48:13.662
We also heard
you're looking for new members.

48:13.664 --> 48:15.163
- Do you guys cheer?
- Yeah.

48:15.165 --> 48:17.265
We're a stunt team
from the Eastern Hills.

48:17.267 --> 48:19.167
No way! That's perfect.

48:19.169 --> 48:21.837
Wait, but why would you
wanna cheer with us?

48:21.839 --> 48:24.372
Well, honestly,
Charlotte and Abi

48:24.374 --> 48:27.308
have been terrorizing every
other cheer team in the area.

48:27.310 --> 48:28.343
Ours included.

48:28.345 --> 48:29.345
When we heard that someone

48:29.347 --> 48:30.745
was finally forming a team

48:30.747 --> 48:31.913
good enough to take them on,

48:31.915 --> 48:34.649
we wanted to see for ourselves.

48:34.651 --> 48:36.384
Yeah, but are you any good?

48:51.301 --> 48:53.104
Wow.

49:00.377 --> 49:02.113
You're decent, I guess.

49:05.283 --> 49:06.585
You're in!

49:13.691 --> 49:15.991
All right, guys,
so I've counted the money.

49:15.993 --> 49:17.859
We have way above what we need.

49:17.861 --> 49:20.428
Uniforms, entry fee,
everything is covered!

49:23.600 --> 49:25.334
Yeah, you're welcome.

49:25.336 --> 49:27.836
Good thing Ethan and I
came along to save the day.

49:27.838 --> 49:30.475
You were barely even there.

49:31.508 --> 49:32.741
Hey! No, no.

49:32.743 --> 49:34.276
Oh, no, stop, stop, stop!

49:39.584 --> 49:40.785
Wet 'em.

49:46.524 --> 49:50.392
<i>Like I said,
a car wash always works.</i>

49:50.394 --> 49:51.961
<i>Not only did we have
the money we needed,</i>

49:51.963 --> 49:54.964
<i>but we also picked up the extra
team members we needed.</i>

49:54.966 --> 49:57.732
<i>We were also
finally acting like a team.</i>

49:57.734 --> 49:59.834
<i>We officially had
each other's backs.</i>

49:59.836 --> 50:01.502
<i>Maybe at this exact moment</i>

50:01.504 --> 50:03.339
<i>we were shooting
each other in the backs,</i>

50:03.341 --> 50:04.607
<i>but you know what I mean.</i>

50:10.314 --> 50:11.714
Stop playing with my hair!

50:11.716 --> 50:13.348
Okay, you'll be pleased to know

50:13.350 --> 50:15.417
the new uniforms
have been ordered.

50:17.555 --> 50:19.053
So they'll take
a couple of weeks to arrive.

50:19.055 --> 50:21.325
We'll just have to make-do
in the meantime.

50:22.426 --> 50:24.426
Coach, was it a problem

50:24.428 --> 50:26.698
getting a toddler-sized uniform
for Mia?

50:29.399 --> 50:31.000
We'll have to tailor
Tilds' uniform

50:31.002 --> 50:33.468
to accommodate her mammoth head
and cankles.

50:33.470 --> 50:34.903
- Shut it, pint-size.
- Guys.

50:34.905 --> 50:36.904
Will you please take it easy?

50:36.906 --> 50:38.807
Things are finally
looking up for us.

50:38.809 --> 50:40.942
The last thing we need
is internal drama.

50:40.944 --> 50:44.680
So please,
take it down a few notches.

50:44.682 --> 50:47.082
Okay, everyone, you guys wanna
get in first formation?

50:47.084 --> 50:48.419
Cool.

50:50.588 --> 50:51.986
Okay, stop it with the arm.

50:51.988 --> 50:53.988
Wow, it's like getting pushed
by a Chihuahua.

50:53.990 --> 50:56.292
All right, that's enough!

50:56.294 --> 50:58.493
What is it
with you two?

50:58.495 --> 51:00.595
- It's her fault.
- Seriously...

51:00.597 --> 51:03.098
Why do you guys have it in
for each other?

51:03.100 --> 51:03.934
Okay, fine.

51:05.303 --> 51:06.468
You wanna know
what the real problem is?

51:06.470 --> 51:08.604
Yes!

51:08.606 --> 51:10.506
Tilds single-handedly sabotaged

51:10.508 --> 51:13.408
one of the most important
dance competitions of my life!

51:13.410 --> 51:15.678
Please, you lost that comp
just fine on your own.

51:15.680 --> 51:18.817
- Are you kidding me?
- Just let Mia talk.

51:20.950 --> 51:23.352
I was in the zone and
I was ready to perform, okay?

51:23.354 --> 51:25.654
I was ready to go,
and then Tilds just comes along

51:25.656 --> 51:27.659
and she spills her soda
all over me.

51:29.126 --> 51:32.394
- That's why you're upset?
- It was a really big deal!

51:32.396 --> 51:35.064
I mean, I lost the comp
and Tilds won!

51:35.066 --> 51:36.865
Ever since that one night,

51:36.867 --> 51:37.933
I've been playing catch-up
to her

51:37.935 --> 51:40.435
and I'm so tired of it.

51:40.437 --> 51:41.772
You're still eating my dust.

51:42.740 --> 51:44.073
All right, you know what?

51:44.075 --> 51:46.875
I can't even listen
to "I'm A Little Teapot"

51:46.877 --> 51:48.776
without breaking out in a rash.

51:48.778 --> 51:50.345
Wa-wa-wa-wait.

51:50.347 --> 51:53.749
How old were you
when this all happened?

51:53.751 --> 51:55.817
I think I was six.

51:55.819 --> 51:57.519
- And you... I...
- Yeah...

51:57.521 --> 51:59.421
Yeah, you were six
and I was seven.

51:59.423 --> 52:00.823
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah.

52:00.825 --> 52:02.658
Wait, you guys
have got to be kidding.

52:02.660 --> 52:04.892
Okay, look,
it was a really big deal.

52:04.894 --> 52:07.895
- All right?
- It was actually pretty cute.

52:07.897 --> 52:09.598
I think she was the same height
back then.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.401
Okay, everyone,
just, uh, calm down.

52:12.403 --> 52:14.870
Mia, Tilds,

52:14.872 --> 52:17.071
you need to let it go, okay?

52:17.073 --> 52:19.875
When we're in here,
we need to be a family.

52:19.877 --> 52:21.877
When we're on this floor, we
need to look out for each other.

52:21.879 --> 52:24.912
Okay? We need to be there
for each other.

52:24.914 --> 52:26.982
I know you don't wanna put
the rest of your teammates here,

52:26.984 --> 52:28.950
all your friends, at risk

52:28.952 --> 52:31.388
of falling apart and losing.

52:33.089 --> 52:35.924
If we don't,
we're never gonna win.

52:35.926 --> 52:38.627
You guys do wanna beat
Charlotte and Abi, right?

52:38.629 --> 52:40.162
- Yeah, of course.
- Obviously.

52:40.164 --> 52:43.799
Then, on this floor,
you're sisters.

52:43.801 --> 52:45.103
Got it?

52:53.644 --> 52:56.113
- What's happening?
- Nothing. We're all good.

52:57.180 --> 52:59.214
Okay.

52:59.216 --> 53:02.017
Well, there's a competition
down south this weekend

53:02.019 --> 53:04.453
called
the Autumn Cheer Challenge.

53:04.455 --> 53:06.955
And I have registered us
to compete.

53:06.957 --> 53:09.792
Oh, wait. So we're gonna compete
without our uniforms?

53:09.794 --> 53:11.959
We don't need uniforms,
we just...

53:11.961 --> 53:14.863
We need one performance
under our belt as a team, okay?

53:14.865 --> 53:16.698
All right, well, why don't we
run through the full routine

53:16.700 --> 53:19.435
with music,
pretend like it's the real deal,

53:19.437 --> 53:20.935
see if we can get through
without stumbling?

53:20.937 --> 53:22.870
Good idea. Okay, let's do it.

53:22.872 --> 53:24.071
First positions.

53:29.613 --> 53:31.245
<i>♪ Gotta bring it
gotta bring it ♪</i>

53:31.247 --> 53:32.513
<i>♪ Bring it bring it ♪</i>

53:32.515 --> 53:33.982
<i>♪ Hey gotta bring it ♪</i>

53:33.984 --> 53:36.718
<i>♪ Gotta bring it
bring it bring it ♪</i>

53:36.720 --> 53:38.553
<i>♪ Gotta bring it
gotta bring it ♪</i>

53:38.555 --> 53:40.122
<i>♪ Gotta bring it bring it... ♪♪</i>

53:40.124 --> 53:42.124
- Anyone up for a bite?
- Yeah.

53:42.126 --> 53:44.526
I can't.
Sorry, I got a big night.

53:44.528 --> 53:47.129
And, Emma,
I was hoping I could borrow you.

53:47.131 --> 53:48.930
Uh, it's actually
kind of important.

53:48.932 --> 53:50.631
Yeah, no prob.

53:50.633 --> 53:53.468
Sorry, Ethan. Can we,
maybe do it another night?

53:53.470 --> 53:56.540
- Sure. I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

53:58.676 --> 54:00.145
- See you guys.
- Bye.

54:02.479 --> 54:03.781
So what's up?

54:05.982 --> 54:08.816
- It...
- Oh, uh, okay.

54:08.818 --> 54:11.955
No, okay, we need to work
on this. Come on.

54:15.225 --> 54:18.227
We got a lot of work to do.

54:29.240 --> 54:31.173
Okay, so I checked
the competitors list

54:31.175 --> 54:33.674
and Charlotte's squad
isn't competing.

54:33.676 --> 54:35.977
Okay? So you can get that
out of your head.

54:35.979 --> 54:38.550
Let's just focus
on doing our best. Let's do it.

55:07.077 --> 55:08.176
Go!

55:08.178 --> 55:09.578
Oh, look.

55:09.580 --> 55:11.616
It's Emma and the wannabes.

55:12.550 --> 55:13.982
And they're growing.

55:13.984 --> 55:15.651
Are you taking the worst members

55:15.653 --> 55:16.718
from every cheer squad now?

55:18.289 --> 55:20.288
Abi and I heard
that you guys were competing,

55:20.290 --> 55:22.089
so we thought we'd come to offer

55:22.091 --> 55:25.160
some
moral support. Hm.

55:25.162 --> 55:28.129
This comp is probably
more your level.

55:28.131 --> 55:30.765
It's mostly junior teams.

55:30.767 --> 55:33.801
Mia and Amahli
fit right in.

55:33.803 --> 55:36.673
And Tilds,
on an emotional level.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.941
Nice uniforms, by the way.

55:39.943 --> 55:42.009
It was a really smart move
to pull them out of a dumpster.

55:42.011 --> 55:45.147
Ignore them. They're just trying
to get in our heads.

55:45.149 --> 55:46.314
We know how amazing we are.

55:46.316 --> 55:47.381
<i>Next up,</i>

55:47.383 --> 55:49.817
<i>the only senior-level fourteen.</i>

55:49.819 --> 55:51.587
- <i>Eclipse All-Star Cheer.</i>
- Warm up, guys.

55:53.222 --> 55:57.024
Eclipse All-Star Cheer?

55:57.026 --> 55:58.727
That's your name.

55:58.729 --> 56:00.828
Yeah, that's right.

56:00.830 --> 56:02.930
And you can watch us
live up to the name.

56:02.932 --> 56:05.366
And you'd think
with a name like that

56:05.368 --> 56:07.671
you'd actually have some winners
in your team?

56:30.060 --> 56:31.129

57:56.180 --> 57:57.682
Well...

57:58.848 --> 58:01.450
that was a disaster.

58:01.452 --> 58:04.051
Pretty much.

58:04.053 --> 58:06.187
We let Charlotte and Abi
shake our confidence

58:06.189 --> 58:08.189
right before our routine.

58:08.191 --> 58:09.924
Of course,
we were gonna stumble.

58:09.926 --> 58:12.294
I'm so embarrassed.
I might as well quit.

58:12.296 --> 58:15.263
Now, if you quit,
then I'll quit, too.

58:15.265 --> 58:18.236
- You'd quit because of me?
- Oh! Yuck!

58:19.836 --> 58:22.470
We just need an edgy routine,
that's all it is.

58:22.472 --> 58:24.939
Edgy routine isn't gonna do
anything we haven't done.

58:26.843 --> 58:28.243
Do you know
how embarrassing that was?

58:28.245 --> 58:29.343
Well, it's not just
because of you.

58:33.117 --> 58:35.319
Don't need an edgy routine,
we can't do it...

58:37.955 --> 58:39.723
Hey, you guys!

58:41.357 --> 58:43.959
What we need
is to work together as a team

58:43.961 --> 58:47.428
and not be
at each others' throats.

58:47.430 --> 58:49.531
Look, we all bring something
special to the group.

58:49.533 --> 58:52.366
Okay?
That's one of our strengths.

58:52.368 --> 58:55.403
And while each of these
individual talents are great,

58:55.405 --> 58:57.404
it's not gonna help us
if it's dividing us

58:57.406 --> 58:58.839
instead of unifying us.

58:58.841 --> 59:01.008
So what are we supposed to do?

59:01.010 --> 59:02.343
Belly dance like Amahli?

59:07.785 --> 59:09.821
Actually, yeah.

59:11.854 --> 59:14.455
And it's not just
belly dancing, either.

59:14.457 --> 59:15.924
Liam, playing footy
has taught you

59:15.926 --> 59:17.959
how to work
with your teammates, right?

59:17.961 --> 59:19.127
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:19.129 --> 59:21.962
And same
with you and soccer, Ethan.

59:21.964 --> 59:23.365
Look, not only
can we learn how to work

59:23.367 --> 59:25.433
as a single unit,
but we'll be able to bring

59:25.435 --> 59:27.201
something new and fresh
to the table,

59:27.203 --> 59:29.370
something the judges
have never seen before.

59:29.372 --> 59:32.374
What exactly are you suggesting?

59:32.376 --> 59:35.379
I think it's time that
we all learned some new moves.

59:37.147 --> 59:38.979
You ready to bust out
some hip-hop?

59:42.252 --> 59:45.089
Hip-hop is all about attitude.

59:46.356 --> 59:50.058
Left leg, right arm. No.

59:50.060 --> 59:52.928
One, two, three, four.

59:52.930 --> 59:55.399
Five and six. Seven, eight.

59:57.100 --> 59:59.433
In soccer, even when we warm-up,

59:59.435 --> 01:00:01.468
we wanna be in perfect sync.

01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:03.437
We wanna show the opposition
and ourselves

01:00:03.439 --> 01:00:05.443
that we're on the same page.

01:00:08.477 --> 01:00:09.944
See,
even without a word,

01:00:09.946 --> 01:00:11.645
they're in perfect sync.

01:00:11.647 --> 01:00:13.848
So let's give it a shot.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:16.852
Ready? Yes, that's it.

01:00:16.854 --> 01:00:19.022
- Loose. And now you come.
- And go.

01:00:20.457 --> 01:00:22.424
- You start from the back.
- Yeah!

01:00:22.426 --> 01:00:23.591
Whoo!

01:00:23.593 --> 01:00:25.526
One, two, three, four,

01:00:25.528 --> 01:00:27.294
five, six, seven, eight.

01:00:27.296 --> 01:00:30.098
All right, guys, so soccer
warm-up is all well and good,

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.466
but if you guys wanna see
some real teamwork,

01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:34.401
then just watch and learn.

01:00:36.874 --> 01:00:41.075
<i>♪ Meaner faster stronger ♪</i>

01:00:41.077 --> 01:00:43.980
All right,
so now we're gonna do that.

01:00:45.448 --> 01:00:48.183
Then you start, then you start.

01:00:48.185 --> 01:00:51.419
<i>♪ Meaner faster stronger ♪</i>

01:00:51.421 --> 01:00:53.057
- All right.
- Beautiful.

01:01:04.468 --> 01:01:07.468
Okay, guys, core energy
is paramount in belly dancing.

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.272
So age and body type
don't matter.

01:01:10.274 --> 01:01:11.573
It's like you're
lifting your hip a bit.

01:01:11.575 --> 01:01:12.573
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:12.575 --> 01:01:14.209
I want one of those bell things.

01:01:42.339 --> 01:01:44.104
You guys! That was insane!

01:01:44.106 --> 01:01:46.107
Okay, competition's tomorrow.

01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:47.741
If we keep this energy level up,

01:01:47.743 --> 01:01:50.511
there's no way we're gonna lose.

01:01:50.513 --> 01:01:51.712
Everyone get rest.

01:01:51.714 --> 01:01:54.214
I'll see you
at the championships.

01:01:54.216 --> 01:01:55.350
We could actually
stand a chance.

01:01:55.352 --> 01:01:56.517
We can,
of course, we can.

01:01:56.519 --> 01:01:57.519
- What are you talking...
- Oh, shoot.

01:01:57.521 --> 01:01:59.220
I left my soccer bag inside.

01:01:59.222 --> 01:02:00.522
- Oh, I moved it.
- See you, guys.

01:02:00.524 --> 01:02:01.555
Sorry,
I'll come with...

01:02:01.557 --> 01:02:03.658
Bye, guys. I think I just...

01:02:18.107 --> 01:02:19.510
What was that?

01:02:20.609 --> 01:02:22.613
- Are they...
- I don't know.

01:02:24.013 --> 01:02:26.281
I feel so stupid.

01:02:26.283 --> 01:02:28.283
I thought Liam
actually liked me this time.

01:02:28.285 --> 01:02:31.285
Come on, we don't know for
certain that they're together.

01:02:31.287 --> 01:02:35.025
We both saw them, Ethan.
What are we supposed to think?

01:02:44.234 --> 01:02:45.603
What are you doing?

01:02:48.037 --> 01:02:50.037
Hannah?

01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:52.073
It's Amahli.

01:02:52.075 --> 01:02:53.277
I quit.

01:03:00.484 --> 01:03:03.283
So is the team ready
for tomorrow?

01:03:03.285 --> 01:03:05.720
Yeah. I think so.

01:03:05.722 --> 01:03:07.488
We've been training really hard.

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:11.061
Good. Well, I'll be there
doing some cheering of my own.

01:03:12.696 --> 01:03:13.998
Em...

01:03:14.798 --> 01:03:16.464
I know...

01:03:16.466 --> 01:03:19.267
I haven't really
gotten to know the squad,

01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:22.006
but they seem like a good bunch.

01:03:24.374 --> 01:03:26.508
- Um, dad?
- Hm?

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:30.211
Can we talk about California?

01:03:30.213 --> 01:03:31.712
Y-yeah.

01:03:38.687 --> 01:03:40.657
Hannah? What's up?

01:03:42.392 --> 01:03:44.225
- They're quitting?
- Yeah.

01:03:44.227 --> 01:03:46.093
And not just Ethan and Amahli.
Right?

01:03:46.095 --> 01:03:48.696
Somehow it spread to the whole
team and it's blowing up.

01:03:48.698 --> 01:03:51.466
I mean, Tilds and Mia found
a reason to fight, of course.

01:03:51.468 --> 01:03:53.167
And Bec and her friends are mad

01:03:53.169 --> 01:03:54.669
because they gave up performing
to join us,

01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:58.605
and... we don't even have
enough people to compete.

01:03:58.607 --> 01:04:01.408
So any huge plan
to save the day?

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.111
Yeah.

01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:08.118
I don't know,
you can kiss Ethan or something.

01:04:09.618 --> 01:04:11.655
I'm just brainstorming here.

01:04:12.522 --> 01:04:14.325
I don't know.

01:04:15.624 --> 01:04:17.625
Maybe this is a sign.

01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:20.495
Maybe I just shouldn't get
too involved.

01:04:20.497 --> 01:04:21.732
Huh?

01:04:24.468 --> 01:04:28.172
Look...
I have to tell you something.

01:04:29.805 --> 01:04:33.476
I'm not gonna be here
for as long as I said I was.

01:04:36.278 --> 01:04:38.348
I'm leaving in a month.

01:04:39.783 --> 01:04:42.716
What? When were you
gonna tell me?

01:04:42.718 --> 01:04:44.819
I don't even know
if I was going to.

01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:47.321
It just would've been easier
to hop on a plane and leave.

01:04:47.323 --> 01:04:49.823
Hannah, you have no idea
what it's like.

01:04:49.825 --> 01:04:51.625
Trying to make friends
all the time,

01:04:51.627 --> 01:04:53.895
just to have
to leave them forever.

01:04:53.897 --> 01:04:56.230
I've learned to say goodbye

01:04:56.232 --> 01:05:00.167
in six different languages.

01:05:00.169 --> 01:05:01.803
And I'm really
not looking forward

01:05:01.805 --> 01:05:03.238
to learning how to say it here.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.439
What about
all that stuff you said

01:05:04.441 --> 01:05:05.874
about being family,

01:05:05.876 --> 01:05:07.808
about us being sisters
on the floor?

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:10.879
I-I can't be a part
of that family.

01:05:10.881 --> 01:05:13.515
I can't be here to clean up
messes like that, okay?

01:05:13.517 --> 01:05:16.316
Maybe you should learn
to start leading.

01:05:16.318 --> 01:05:18.520
That's great, you know,
you like it or not,

01:05:18.522 --> 01:05:20.488
you are part of this family.

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:22.624
And if you choose to do nothing
'cause it's easier,

01:05:22.626 --> 01:05:24.227
that's your decision.

01:05:25.928 --> 01:05:28.930
You know,
we all believed in you, Emma.

01:05:28.932 --> 01:05:30.497
When you got here,
that team had been gutted

01:05:30.499 --> 01:05:32.799
by Charlotte and Abi.

01:05:32.801 --> 01:05:35.403
And when they left...

01:05:35.405 --> 01:05:36.904
we thought
about going with them.

01:05:36.906 --> 01:05:38.872
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:05:38.874 --> 01:05:40.908
Right? Cheer was easy.

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:42.509
Not many teams,
Charlotte and Abi

01:05:42.511 --> 01:05:45.412
even went to nationals
in their first year.

01:05:45.414 --> 01:05:46.814
Abi told us
that we weren't good enough

01:05:46.816 --> 01:05:48.582
and that she wouldn't
have us and...

01:05:48.584 --> 01:05:50.285
Some of us took it really hard.

01:05:50.287 --> 01:05:54.221
Like, me and Mia.
We believed them.

01:05:54.223 --> 01:05:56.957
You came along and you built us
to be something better.

01:05:56.959 --> 01:05:58.560
So, yeah, all right,

01:05:58.562 --> 01:06:00.928
leaving your friends is hard,
that I understand.

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:02.529
But what I'm not gonna
forgive you for is

01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:03.964
coming in, giving the team hope

01:06:03.966 --> 01:06:05.433
and then leaving
when we need you

01:06:05.435 --> 01:06:07.769
'cause you're too scared
of saying goodbye.

01:06:07.771 --> 01:06:10.441
It's hooroo down here,
by the way.

01:06:11.508 --> 01:06:13.607
So hooroo, Emma.

01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:15.646
Hope we're easy to forget.

01:06:26.356 --> 01:06:27.957
I've been looking for you.

01:06:29.993 --> 01:06:32.227
I had a fight with Hannah.

01:06:32.229 --> 01:06:34.431
I know. I heard.

01:06:35.865 --> 01:06:38.799
Em, you know
I never wanna upset you, right?

01:06:38.801 --> 01:06:40.901
It's just...

01:06:40.903 --> 01:06:42.972
I never knew
how you really felt.

01:06:44.807 --> 01:06:48.609
I know all this moving around
isn't easy.

01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:51.712
Well...
I don't know.

01:06:51.714 --> 01:06:54.285
It seemed easier
than the alternative.

01:06:55.852 --> 01:06:58.019
Ever since your mom died,

01:06:58.021 --> 01:07:00.787
moving around made sense.

01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:02.624
Not setting down roots,

01:07:02.626 --> 01:07:04.959
not getting too close to people.

01:07:04.961 --> 01:07:07.794
You know, the less
you're close to someone,

01:07:07.796 --> 01:07:10.798
the less chances
they'll break your heart

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.535
when they're gone.

01:07:14.838 --> 01:07:18.309
And now I'm worried
that I've passed that on to you.

01:07:19.776 --> 01:07:23.611
Just you and me. It's selfish.

01:07:23.613 --> 01:07:25.613
There are people who need us.

01:07:25.615 --> 01:07:27.548
And we need them, too,

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:30.551
even if it risks the hurt.

01:07:30.553 --> 01:07:31.789
Come here.

01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:40.861
- Dad?
- Be honest with me.

01:07:40.863 --> 01:07:42.497
You wanna stay here?

01:07:42.499 --> 01:07:46.533
<i>Yes! Tell him yes!</i>

01:07:46.535 --> 01:07:47.704
Yes.

01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:50.274
Good.

01:07:51.807 --> 01:07:55.343
I'm gonna turn down the job
in California.

01:07:55.345 --> 01:07:58.613
And I think we might be here
a while.

01:07:58.615 --> 01:08:00.350
Where are you going?

01:08:02.484 --> 01:08:04.787
I have some calls
I need to make.

01:08:07.323 --> 01:08:09.359
There are people who need me.

01:08:10.859 --> 01:08:12.495
And I need them...

01:08:13.595 --> 01:08:15.465
even if it hurts.

01:08:30.712 --> 01:08:32.380
Wait. You guys are here?

01:08:32.381 --> 01:08:34.415
I didn't think
anyone was coming.

01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:36.818
- Did you get the text?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:40.487
I thought I was the only one letting the
team down, so I came ready to compete.

01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:41.656
I don't understand
why Em has asked us

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:42.956
to come so early, though.

01:08:42.957 --> 01:08:44.358
- Let's go find out.
- Yeah.

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:45.526
Do you think
she's downstairs?

01:08:45.528 --> 01:08:46.827
<i>...the B team.</i>

01:08:46.828 --> 01:08:48.395
<i>Can the Eclipse team</i>

01:08:48.397 --> 01:08:50.162
<i>please assemble
in the room upstairs?</i>

01:08:50.165 --> 01:08:51.631
Wait,
the whole team's here?

01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:53.067
Yup, I thought
I was the only one

01:08:53.069 --> 01:08:55.702
who got the text until everyone
started showing up.

01:08:55.703 --> 01:08:57.707
<i>If I could have
your attention please...</i>

01:09:02.944 --> 01:09:05.779
What is she up to?

01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:09.483
Um, I wanna thank you all
for coming.

01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:13.854
I know some of you may not be
too happy with me right now.

01:09:13.856 --> 01:09:16.526
Some of you think
that I betrayed you.

01:09:18.093 --> 01:09:19.594
But I just want you to know

01:09:19.595 --> 01:09:22.196
that I would never do anything
to hurt you

01:09:22.198 --> 01:09:24.098
and I would never do anything

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.634
to destroy everything
that we've built.

01:09:26.636 --> 01:09:29.871
And to prove that, um,
I'm gonna need some help.

01:09:29.872 --> 01:09:31.140
So...

01:09:32.742 --> 01:09:34.778
Amahli, will you join me?

01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:44.152
I don't understand.
What's happening?

01:09:44.154 --> 01:09:46.219
Could everybody
please give a warm welcome

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.756
to our pre-show performer,

01:09:49.758 --> 01:09:53.594
the Brighton Bombers'
very own number 18,

01:09:53.595 --> 01:09:55.129
Liam Nelson.

01:09:55.131 --> 01:09:57.965
- Yay!
- Nice shirt, Liam.

01:09:57.967 --> 01:10:01.602
I'm loving those frills.

01:10:01.604 --> 01:10:03.871
Liam, what is going on?

01:10:03.873 --> 01:10:06.474
I'm fixing a mistake.

01:10:06.476 --> 01:10:09.042
And I'm showing
what I was doing with Emma.

01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:10.777
Amahli, may I have this dance?

01:11:04.534 --> 01:11:06.767
So that's what
you guys were doing.

01:11:06.769 --> 01:11:09.069
- Learning to salsa?
- That's it, man.

01:11:09.071 --> 01:11:12.572
Trust me,
Emma's got zero interest in me.

01:11:12.574 --> 01:11:14.908
And besides,
I've only got eyes on one girl.

01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:16.712
Okay, you're officially
forgiven.

01:11:24.287 --> 01:11:26.219
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:26.221 --> 01:11:29.857
Look, that was really cool
what you did.

01:11:29.859 --> 01:11:32.926
I mean, I feel kinda stupid.

01:11:32.928 --> 01:11:34.828
Like, for jumping
to conclusions.

01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:37.063
No, it's, it's okay.

01:11:37.065 --> 01:11:40.536
You had good reasons to doubt
how I felt.

01:11:42.137 --> 01:11:44.639
Look, I haven't been

01:11:44.641 --> 01:11:48.545
as upfront and honest as...

01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:50.547
I'd like to be.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.517
But I'm ready
for that to change...

01:11:54.918 --> 01:11:55.919
starting now.

01:12:05.261 --> 01:12:07.263
Can you give me a second?

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.634
You pulled out all the stops
to get the team back together.

01:12:13.636 --> 01:12:16.970
- You must really wanna win.
- I do.

01:12:16.972 --> 01:12:19.639
You guys, can I just
say something?

01:12:19.641 --> 01:12:23.810
Look, I know that
things have been a little rough.

01:12:23.812 --> 01:12:26.913
There's been tension
in the group.

01:12:26.915 --> 01:12:28.916
And I really hope
that we can all

01:12:28.918 --> 01:12:30.585
put that to rest

01:12:30.587 --> 01:12:32.018
because this is the best squad

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.788
I've ever been a part of.

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:37.090
And it's not just the talent,
even though

01:12:37.092 --> 01:12:39.093
we have a ton of that.

01:12:39.095 --> 01:12:41.862
I mean, even those of us
that fight

01:12:41.864 --> 01:12:43.901
have learned
to put our differences aside.

01:12:46.703 --> 01:12:49.705
But over everything...

01:12:50.839 --> 01:12:52.943
you guys are my friends...

01:12:53.876 --> 01:12:55.675
my family.

01:12:55.677 --> 01:12:59.246
The truth is that I need you.

01:12:59.248 --> 01:13:02.049
And I think
if we stick together,

01:13:02.051 --> 01:13:05.419
we can do really great things.

01:13:05.421 --> 01:13:08.322
And I know that we can
still win this championship

01:13:08.324 --> 01:13:10.127
if we still want it.

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.893
This team's good enough,

01:13:13.895 --> 01:13:17.697
no matter what anybody else
has told you.

01:13:17.699 --> 01:13:19.233
So what do you say?

01:13:19.235 --> 01:13:21.768
Let's go win ourselves
a championship.

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:23.069
On three, guys.

01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:25.272
- One, two, three.
- Rah!

Good luck.

01:14:58.133 --> 01:15:00.768
Thanks, but we don't need luck.

01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:03.203
Yeah, we have talent.

01:15:03.205 --> 01:15:05.840
I managed to weed out anyone
that's dragging us down.

01:15:05.842 --> 01:15:09.009
Do you know what, Abi? I'm glad
you didn't take me in your team.

01:15:09.011 --> 01:15:11.778
Because when we beat you today
and your squad realizes

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.281
they've had to put up with
how awful you are for nothing,

01:15:14.283 --> 01:15:15.549
they're gonna drop you so fast,

01:15:15.551 --> 01:15:17.917
you're gonna be begging us
to let you join.

01:15:17.919 --> 01:15:21.388
Oh, please, my team
are gonna stay as the best.

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.424
And your team, well,

01:15:23.426 --> 01:15:26.760
you can go back to being
the worst gymnastics squad.

01:15:26.762 --> 01:15:29.699
Come on, girls,
we have a championship to win.

01:15:33.503 --> 01:15:36.237
Abi is the worst.

01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:39.273
When I was training
before gym state comp,

01:15:39.275 --> 01:15:41.474
Abi convinced me
that the venue had changed.

01:15:41.476 --> 01:15:43.877
So my parents and I
drove to the wrong place.

01:15:43.879 --> 01:15:45.946
And by the time
we got to the right one,

01:15:45.948 --> 01:15:47.848
I missed my first apparatus.

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:50.550
Charlotte won,
and Abi came in second.

01:15:50.552 --> 01:15:54.354
Wow! Charlotte and Abi
really will do anything to win.

01:15:54.356 --> 01:15:56.389
I know, right?
My folks got so mad.

01:15:56.391 --> 01:15:58.591
They switched me
from gym to dance.

01:15:58.593 --> 01:16:01.027
Also that Abi
could cheat her way to a medal.

01:16:01.029 --> 01:16:04.063
Wait. Wait, guys, guys,
I've got it.

01:16:04.065 --> 01:16:05.566
All right, I can call
my spider guy, okay?

01:16:05.568 --> 01:16:07.968
All we need
are a couple of buckets.

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:09.870
We head up to the rafters,

01:16:09.872 --> 01:16:12.505
wait for their finale
and then, boom!

01:16:12.507 --> 01:16:14.441
It's raining spiders.

01:16:14.443 --> 01:16:17.114
Okay, come on,
let's go get ready.

01:16:19.848 --> 01:16:21.615
I thought it was a good idea.

01:16:21.617 --> 01:16:25.051
- Wait, really?
- Nah.

01:16:25.053 --> 01:16:27.457

Whoo!

01:21:31.327 --> 01:21:34.164
<i>Just waiting
for the final scores.</i>

01:21:42.538 --> 01:21:43.703
<i>And the grand champion winner</i>

01:21:43.705 --> 01:21:47.310
<i>is Eclipse All-Star Cheer.</i>

01:21:49.278 --> 01:21:52.545
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a new championship team.</i>

01:21:52.547 --> 01:21:55.482
<i>ACC have been eclipsed.</i>

01:21:55.484 --> 01:21:59.388
<i>Two-time champions ACC
have been beaten.</i>

01:22:04.526 --> 01:22:06.863
<i>The presentations
will commence shortly.</i>

01:22:10.932 --> 01:22:13.300
How did this even happen?

01:22:13.302 --> 01:22:15.301
Because they're really good.

01:22:15.303 --> 01:22:18.639
Not as good as us.
Whose side are you on anyway?

01:22:18.641 --> 01:22:21.908
I'm with the judges.
They won fair and square.

01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:26.212
How can you say that after
everything I've done for you?

01:22:26.214 --> 01:22:27.581
Oh, come on, Charlotte.

01:22:27.583 --> 01:22:29.816
You're not exactly
the one with the brains.

01:22:29.818 --> 01:22:32.618
You would never have left
that stupid gymnastics team

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.688
if I hadn't orchestrated
on getting you all out.

01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:37.456
What are you talking about?

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:41.327
ACC. The A is for Abi.
It's my team.

01:22:41.329 --> 01:22:44.264
I'm the one that even suggested
we form a cheer squad.

01:22:44.266 --> 01:22:47.000
I set us up with the fundings,
which you lost.

01:22:47.002 --> 01:22:49.736
I made sure
we only had the best,

01:22:49.738 --> 01:22:50.970
and now it's over.

01:22:50.972 --> 01:22:53.473
You guys are nothing without me.

01:22:53.475 --> 01:22:56.276
You know what, Abi?

01:22:56.278 --> 01:22:59.947
Hannah was right about you.
You really are awful.

01:22:59.949 --> 01:23:02.816
And I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

01:23:02.818 --> 01:23:05.655
Fine. We don't need you anymore.

01:23:06.689 --> 01:23:08.158
Right, guys?

01:23:16.864 --> 01:23:18.497
I don't need any of you.

01:23:18.499 --> 01:23:21.001
<i>Come on up,
Eclipse All-Star Cheer,</i>

01:23:21.003 --> 01:23:23.402
<i>to collect
the champions trophy.</i>

01:23:33.748 --> 01:23:36.883
<i>So that's how our team
went from hot mess</i>

01:23:36.885 --> 01:23:40.019
<i>to Australia's
hottest cheer squad.</i>

01:23:40.021 --> 01:23:42.522
<i>Well, soon-to-be.</i>

01:23:47.796 --> 01:23:49.729
Congratulations.

01:23:49.731 --> 01:23:53.000
Thanks. We have a great team.

01:23:53.002 --> 01:23:55.736
Look, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

01:23:55.738 --> 01:23:58.071
You guys were right.

01:23:58.073 --> 01:24:00.340
- We want to combine teams.
- What?

01:24:00.342 --> 01:24:02.041
Listen, Abi is gone. Okay?

01:24:02.043 --> 01:24:03.643
And none of us have any interest

01:24:03.645 --> 01:24:05.612
in being part
of a team like that again.

01:24:05.614 --> 01:24:08.648
We wanna go bigger. Nationals.

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:12.419
But our team is too small,
and, frankly, so is yours.

01:24:12.421 --> 01:24:14.987
If either of us
want a shot at placing,

01:24:14.989 --> 01:24:16.756
we have to combine forces.

01:24:16.758 --> 01:24:19.492
No way.
After everything you've done...

01:24:19.494 --> 01:24:22.696
Hannah... she's right.

01:24:22.698 --> 01:24:24.563
If we wanna go to nationals,
we need to double

01:24:24.565 --> 01:24:27.667
the size of our team.
And they all have to be pros.

01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:29.335
I mean, where else
are we gonna find that?

01:24:29.337 --> 01:24:30.903
Em, it's Charlotte.

01:24:30.905 --> 01:24:32.773
This whole time
we've been trying to beat her.

01:24:32.775 --> 01:24:35.442
I know, and we did.

01:24:35.444 --> 01:24:36.876
And I mean,
now that it's all done,

01:24:36.878 --> 01:24:40.479
maybe it's time that we extended
our family a little bit.

01:24:40.481 --> 01:24:43.750
But I'm not gonna do it
unless you're okay with it.

01:24:43.752 --> 01:24:45.855
I mean, unless you guys
are all okay with it.

01:24:48.589 --> 01:24:50.560
But Emma is captain.

01:24:56.332 --> 01:24:57.997
Twenty-three!

01:24:57.999 --> 01:24:59.499
- Almost a full team.
- Twenty-three?

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:02.471
That's enough to win nationals.

01:25:03.538 --> 01:25:04.938
<i>Until we take nationals,</i>

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.441
<i>at least I have someone
to take my breath away</i>

01:25:07.443 --> 01:25:09.542
<i>and a best friend
to watch my back.</i>

01:25:09.544 --> 01:25:11.745
<i>Dad turned down his promotion
in California</i>

01:25:11.747 --> 01:25:14.113
<i>and requested an extended
assignment in Adelaide.</i>

01:25:14.115 --> 01:25:15.948
<i>I think he's learning
that letting other people</i>

01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:18.417
<i>into your life
has its advantages.</i>

01:25:18.419 --> 01:25:20.586
<i>I was really glad
I didn't have to say goodbye</i>

01:25:20.588 --> 01:25:22.421
<i>to my new family,
but I've learned</i>

01:25:22.423 --> 01:25:24.991
<i>that goodbyes aren't forever.</i>

01:25:24.993 --> 01:25:27.794
<i>So until we meet again,
goodbye,</i>

01:25:27.796 --> 01:25:30.096
