00:35.570 --> 00:42.700
A Terrorist Arms Bazaar
on the Russian Border.

01:09.540 --> 01:12.770
Our man's in position on the center camera.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.930
It's like a terrorist supermarket.

01:15.010 --> 01:19.450
Chinese Long March Scud, Panther
AS-565 attack helicopter...

01:19.510 --> 01:23.140
a pair of Russian mortars, and the
crates look like American rifles.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.780
Chilean mines, German explosives.
Fun for the whole family.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.690
I.D.S.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.320
White Rook to White Knight.
Show us the pawns.

01:32.390 --> 01:36.160
You see, he did get through, Admiral.
Start with that chap in the middle.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.420
Load the I.D. program, please.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.430
Data base I.D. search.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.430
Checking the databases.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.470
We've got out first match. Satoshi Isagura.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.170
Chemical expert. Wanted for
the Tokyo subway attack.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.210
Currently working for the
insurgent force in Zaire.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.400
Henry Gupta. American.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.250
Practically invented techno-terrorism.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.190
Started out as a student radical
at Berkeley in the '60s.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.190
Now he sells his politics for cash.

02:03.260 --> 02:06.660
Zoom in on that, can you? That
looks like an American encoder.

02:06.730 --> 02:10.288
They use it to control their navigation
satellites: the G.P.S. system.

02:10.289 --> 02:13.830
I wonder, will the C.I.A. be more upset
that they lost it or that we found it?

02:14.900 --> 02:16.800
Excuse me. Admiral?

02:16.870 --> 02:21.640
Thank you, M, we've seen enough.
This is now a military operation.

02:21.710 --> 02:23.540
You saw the Gatling gun?

02:23.610 --> 02:25.980
Are your troops prepared for
that kind of firepower?

02:26.080 --> 02:29.340
We have election in Moscow next week.

02:29.420 --> 02:33.250
The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.980
We'll take the naval option.

02:35.050 --> 02:38.220
In one strike, we take out
half the world's terrorists.

02:38.290 --> 02:41.820
Admiral Roebuck, I must protest.
Get me the Chester.

02:41.890 --> 02:44.390
Best not waste time. My man isn't finished.

02:44.460 --> 02:47.900
Black King to White Bishop.
Authorization to fire.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.570
Get your man out of there. His job is over.

02:52.910 --> 02:54.870
Weapons authorized. Prepare to fire.

02:56.910 --> 03:01.240
On my count. Five, four, three, two, one.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.250
Missile away.

03:06.690 --> 03:08.950
Time to target: four
minutes, eight seconds.

03:11.420 --> 03:13.790
White Knight, four minutes to impact.
Get out of there.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.590
Yes, damn it, I know what it is!
It's on the screen in front of me.

03:17.660 --> 03:20.390
It's a jeep in front of a plane.

03:20.470 --> 03:22.460
Now, get the hell out of there!

03:22.540 --> 03:25.200
What the hell's going on?
You will not wait!

03:25.270 --> 03:27.930
That's an order! What is
your man waiting for?

03:28.010 --> 03:30.980
White Knight? Oh, my God!

03:32.110 --> 03:35.140
Those are Soviet SB-5 nuclear torpedoes.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.610
If the Cruise hits them... Order
them to abort the missile.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.720
H.M.S. Chester urgent.
White Knight, come in.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.950
Abort missile. Abort missile.

03:46.030 --> 03:48.120
Abort missile. Abort missile.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.960
Captain, sir, missile out of range.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.800
Unable to destroy.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.800
White Knight... Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.440
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might.

04:05.550 --> 04:08.310
But even if it does not,
there's enough plutonium...

04:08.410 --> 04:11.320
to make Chernobyl look like picnic.

04:11.380 --> 04:14.620
Bloody hell! Can't you people
keep anything locked up?

04:14.690 --> 04:17.350
Evacuate your troops, and
get him out of there, now!

04:17.420 --> 04:20.649
White Knight, come in.
White Knight, come in!

04:20.730 --> 04:23.130
Keep trying, damn it!
White Knight, come in.

04:27.670 --> 04:29.530
Repeat, White Knight, come in.

04:40.350 --> 04:41.900
Filthy habit.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.030
I've got the encoder.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.670
- What the hell is he doing?
- His job.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.210
He's going for the bombs.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.030
Get that jeep!

05:45.080 --> 05:46.640
Get out of it, James.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.740
One minute to impact.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.520
Thirty seconds to impact.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.080
Backseat driver.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.880
White Knight to White Rook.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.450
I've evacuated the area.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.390
Ask the admiral where he'd
like his bombs delivered.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.810
Sound the general alarm.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.830
The ship has been overflown
by two Chinese MiGs.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.830
We believe they have hostile intent.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.660
Hands to action stations.

12:53.870 --> 12:58.169
H.M.S. Devonshire. This
is your last warning.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.200
You are in Chinese territorial waters.

13:04.780 --> 13:07.980
Officer of the Watch, maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.

13:08.050 --> 13:11.960
Aye, aye, sir. Revolutions 1-6-0, port 20.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.650
Are they insane?

13:17.030 --> 13:20.830
The Chinese pilot insists that we are
only 11 miles off their coast...

13:20.900 --> 13:24.430
and he will fire if we don't turn
around and go to a Chinese port.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.170
Send this: "We are in
international waters..."

13:27.240 --> 13:29.170
and will defend ourselves if attacked."

13:29.240 --> 13:31.640
Copy all this to the Admiralty, urgent.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.780
Are we absolutely sure of our position?

13:37.950 --> 13:39.940
Yes, sir. An exact satellite fix.

13:41.590 --> 13:45.680
Carver Media Group Network - Hamburg.

14:12.180 --> 14:15.450
Captain, we are ready to launch.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.460
Shut down the engines.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.680
Maintain full silence.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.220
A stealth ship may be invisible
to radar but the Seadrill isn't.

14:27.870 --> 14:30.630
We'll launch next time the MiGs fly by...

14:30.700 --> 14:33.870
and the British will think
it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.070
I should report in.

14:40.550 --> 14:44.450
Stamper to Hamburg. Phase
one is in progress.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.350
I'll report back to you with an update.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.290
The MiGs are making another pass.
Let's start the show.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.300
Seadrill in position.

15:11.380 --> 15:12.870
Start the drill.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.620
Release it. Seadrill away.

15:29.830 --> 15:32.520
Green 3-0, torpedo, torpedo, torpedo.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.530
Center bearing 1-1-4.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.530
Officer of the Watch,
come hard right, 1-4-1.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.260
There's been no sonar contact, sir.
The MiGs must have dropped it.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.400
Bearing steady. It's gonna hit, sir.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.670
Brace, brace, brace.

15:54.790 --> 15:57.950
Target: 1200. Knock knock.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.200
Let's go upstairs.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.350
Turn left. Rotating 90 degrees.

16:43.270 --> 16:46.000
Now they're wondering why the
torpedo hasn't exploded.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.370
PWO, Captain. Full damage report.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.970
Backup power, immediately!

16:57.080 --> 16:58.950
Switch to alternate supply.

16:59.020 --> 17:02.190
Three generators are down, sir.
Flooding on four deck aft.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.619
Sir, we're now down 14
degrees by the stern.

17:05.690 --> 17:10.130
Yeoman, send to Admiralty: "Have been
torpedoed by Chinese MiGs. Sinking."

17:10.200 --> 17:14.460
Give them our position.
Right. Abandon ship.

17:14.530 --> 17:17.089
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

17:22.010 --> 17:24.770
Everyone on deck! Come on!

17:34.490 --> 17:36.720
One missile at the MiGs.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.430
Maintaining radio silence.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.450
Their last broadcast, sir.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.120
Mr. Gupta's little trick
with the encoder worked.

18:06.180 --> 18:09.280
They gave their final
position 70 miles from here.

18:09.390 --> 18:11.790
The British Navy will never find them.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.850
Survivors in the water.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.680
Mr. Stamper, I'm having
fun with my headlines.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.580
I need to know the exact
number of survivors.

18:38.680 --> 18:42.480
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure
you use the right kind of ammunition.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.110
Yes, sir.

18:46.460 --> 18:49.020
Delicious.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.920
Start the recovery operation.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.190
Send our divers down to the Devonshire.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.380
Mr. Gupta? Phase one is complete.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.520
Good morning, my golden retrievers.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.930
What kind of havoc shall the Carver
Media Group create in the world today?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.130
News. Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris.

20:09.210 --> 20:12.440
And a plane crash in California. Excellent.

20:12.510 --> 20:16.540
Mr. Jones, are we ready to
release our new software?

20:16.650 --> 20:20.080
Yes, sir. As requested,
it's full of bugs...

20:20.150 --> 20:22.640
which means people will be
forced to upgrade for years.

20:22.750 --> 20:23.880
Outstanding.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.120
Mr. Wallace, call the president.

20:27.190 --> 20:30.590
Tell him if he doesn't sign the
bill lowering the cable rates...

20:30.660 --> 20:32.630
we'll release a video of him
with the cheerleader...

20:32.700 --> 20:35.630
- in the Chicago motel room.
- Inspired, sir.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.130
After he signs the bill,
release the tape anyway.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.830
Consider him slimed.

20:39.910 --> 20:41.570
Excuse me.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.740
He's on transponder seven. Mr. Stamper?

20:47.710 --> 20:51.080
Phase two is underway.
I have the videotape.

20:51.180 --> 20:55.120
I haven't seen it myself, but I'm
told the footage is excellent.

20:55.220 --> 20:59.050
Plus, there were 17 survivors
for your headlines.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.850
Good work, Stamper.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.030
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.960
Make sure you keep it in a safe place.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.200
Gentlemen and ladies...

21:11.270 --> 21:13.830
hold the presses.

21:13.910 --> 21:15.840
This just in.

21:15.910 --> 21:20.340
By a curious quirk of fate,
we have the perfect story...

21:20.410 --> 21:24.110
with which to launch our
Satellite News Network tonight.

21:24.220 --> 21:29.650
It seems a small crisis is
brewing in the South China Sea.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.350
I want full newspaper coverage.
I want magazine stories.

21:33.430 --> 21:37.290
I want books. I want films.
I want TV. I want radio.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.200
I want us on the air 24 hours a day.

21:40.270 --> 21:42.200
This is our moment!

21:43.170 --> 21:46.160
And a billion people around this planet...

21:46.240 --> 21:48.800
will watch it, hear it...

21:48.870 --> 21:52.670
and read about it from
the Carver Media Group.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.040
There's no news like bad news.

22:07.760 --> 22:13.030
I am pleased with your progress, Mr. Bond.

22:13.100 --> 22:19.470
I've always enjoyed studying
a new tongue, Professor.

22:19.540 --> 22:24.500
One might say you have a natural ability.

22:24.580 --> 22:28.440
But practice makes perfect.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.950
How do you say "I'm not here" in Danish?

22:41.030 --> 22:42.580
Just ignore it.

22:42.660 --> 22:46.860
Those are words they just don't
have in their vocabulary.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.700
Bond here. Go to a secure line, 007.

22:52.770 --> 22:56.230
Going to a scrambler, channel four.

22:57.340 --> 22:59.670
That's ridiculous. That ship
was in international waters.

22:59.740 --> 23:04.080
We can't be certain. James? Where are you?

23:04.180 --> 23:06.120
Oh, Moneypenny.

23:07.750 --> 23:11.620
I'm just up here at Oxford
brushing up on a little Danish.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.090
Little?

23:13.160 --> 23:15.750
I'm afraid you're going to have
to kiss off your lesson, James.

23:15.830 --> 23:18.460
We've got a situation here
at the Ministry of Defense.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.560
We're sending the fleet to China.

23:22.130 --> 23:25.630
I'll be there in an hour.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.330
Make that 30 minutes.

23:28.670 --> 23:30.800
Good-bye, my sweet.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.110
You always were a cunning linguist, James.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.040
Don't ask. Don't tell.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.060
That's preposterous. We know exactly
where that ship was positioned.

23:56.130 --> 23:59.500
The G.P.S. system... Global
Positioning Satellites... do not lie.

23:59.570 --> 24:03.510
Yes, but our Singapore station
picked up a mysterious signal...

24:03.580 --> 24:05.630
on the G.P.S. frequency at
the time of the attack.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.640
It could've sent that ship off course.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.700
- I have a missing British frigate...
- I'm aware of that!

24:10.820 --> 24:13.180
And instead of decisive action, all
you want to do is investigate.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.620
My goal is to prevent World War
Three, Admiral, and I don't think...

24:15.690 --> 24:18.680
sending an armada into the recovery
area is the best way to do it.

24:18.790 --> 24:22.060
Where, exactly, did this mysterious G.P.S.
signal come from?

24:22.130 --> 24:25.060
- We're still investigating.
- "Investigating."

24:25.130 --> 24:28.830
M, sometimes I don't think you
have the balls for this job.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.270
Perhaps, but the advantage is...

24:31.340 --> 24:33.460
I don't have to think
with them all the time.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.310
That's enough. Now, where do we stand?

24:38.410 --> 24:42.470
It was an unprovoked attack on a
ship in international waters.

24:42.550 --> 24:46.180
We send in the fleet for recovery
and prepare for full retaliation.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.650
Moderation. We investigate...

24:48.720 --> 24:50.950
and stop short of sending
the entire British Navy...

24:51.020 --> 24:53.220
within ten minutes of the
world's largest air force.

24:53.290 --> 24:56.350
- When will our ships be in position?
- Forty-eight hours.

24:56.430 --> 24:58.560
Christ!

24:58.630 --> 25:00.560
The press are already screaming for blood.

25:00.630 --> 25:03.690
The last thing we want to do
is escalate the situation.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.700
I'm afraid it may be too
late to worry about that.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.530
Seventeen British sailors murdered!

25:12.480 --> 25:15.170
"According to Vietnamese officials
who recovered the bodies..."

25:15.250 --> 25:17.980
the victims were riddled
with the same ammunition...

25:18.080 --> 25:19.609
"used by the Chinese Air Force."

25:19.610 --> 25:22.050
- Did you leak this?
- No.

25:24.260 --> 25:26.750
- It's the first I've heard of it.
- Well, this settles it.

25:28.030 --> 25:30.220
We send in the fleet.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.700
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.

25:41.970 --> 25:43.910
There is one strange thing.

25:43.980 --> 25:46.570
When I called our contact in
Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...

25:46.640 --> 25:48.870
only found our sailors three hours ago.

25:48.980 --> 25:50.570
How'd they get the paper out so fast?

25:50.680 --> 25:54.280
Somebody at Tomorrow knew before
the Vietnamese government did.

25:54.390 --> 25:58.150
How much do you know about
Elliot Carver, 007?

25:58.220 --> 25:59.620
Worldwide media baron.

25:59.690 --> 26:02.460
Able to topple governments
with a single broadcast.

26:02.530 --> 26:05.260
Carver owns that newspaper Tomorrow.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.560
I didn't want to discuss it
in front of the minister...

26:07.630 --> 26:10.600
but that mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.

26:12.140 --> 26:15.660
The P.M. would have my head if he
knew you were investigating him.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.710
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007. We've
arranged for you to be invited...

26:18.780 --> 26:20.870
to a party at Carver's Media Center.

26:20.950 --> 26:23.350
They're celebrating the
launch of a new satellite...

26:23.450 --> 26:27.110
because now he has the ability to
reach every human being on the Earth.

26:27.220 --> 26:30.310
Except the Chinese, who have
refused broadcast rights.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.420
Your ticket, cover story and
rental car reservation.

26:36.490 --> 26:38.160
Sign here, please.

26:38.230 --> 26:42.000
I believe you once had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.270
That was a long time ago, M...

26:45.340 --> 26:47.270
before she was married.

26:48.570 --> 26:51.630
I didn't realize it was public knowledge.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.730
Queen and country, James.

26:53.810 --> 26:56.680
Your job is to find out whether Carver
or someone in his organization...

26:56.780 --> 26:58.910
sent that ship off course and why.

26:59.020 --> 27:01.990
Use your relationship with
Mrs. Carver if necessary.

27:02.090 --> 27:04.380
I doubt if she'll remember me.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.320
Remind her.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.890
Then pump her for information.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.360
You'll just have to decide how
much pumping is needed, James.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.800
If only that were true of
you and I, Moneypenny.

27:56.210 --> 27:58.370
If you'll just sign here, Mr. Bond.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.040
It's the insurance damage waiver...

28:05.120 --> 28:08.110
for your beautiful new car.

28:08.190 --> 28:11.820
- Will you need collision coverage?
- Yes.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.360
Fire?

28:13.420 --> 28:15.620
Probably.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.420
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.190
Personal injury?

28:20.270 --> 28:22.600
I hope not, but accidents do happen.

28:22.670 --> 28:24.790
They frequently do with you.

28:26.270 --> 28:30.070
Well, that takes care of
the normal wear and tear.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.040
Do I need any other protection?

28:32.940 --> 28:37.350
Only from me, 007, unless you bring
that car back in pristine order.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.750
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

28:42.950 --> 28:45.790
Your new BMW 750.

28:45.860 --> 28:49.660
All the usual refinements...
machine guns, rockets...

28:49.730 --> 28:51.960
the G.P.S. tracking system.

28:53.630 --> 28:57.470
Welcome. Please fasten seat belt and
obey all instructions for a safe trip.

28:57.540 --> 29:00.300
I thought you'd pay more
attention to a female voice.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.600
- I think we've met.
- I am not interested...

29:03.680 --> 29:05.640
in your sordid escapades.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.610
Let's get on with it, shall we?

29:07.680 --> 29:09.610
Your new telephone.

29:09.680 --> 29:12.450
Talk here, listen here.

29:12.520 --> 29:15.040
So that's what I've been
doing wrong all these years.

29:16.690 --> 29:20.120
It also includes a fingerprint scanner...

29:20.220 --> 29:23.160
and a 20,000-volt security system.

29:23.230 --> 29:26.250
And this I'm particularly proud of...

29:26.330 --> 29:29.200
the remote control for your car.

29:29.270 --> 29:30.960
Tap twice.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.700
One, two.

29:34.110 --> 29:36.510
Now, draw your finger...

29:36.570 --> 29:39.100
very slowly across the pad...

29:40.240 --> 29:42.180
to drive the car.

29:47.020 --> 29:50.610
It's surprisingly difficult to
drive, but with practice...

29:50.720 --> 29:54.160
Well, let's see how she
responds to my touch, eh, Q?

30:18.820 --> 30:20.720
I think we understand each other.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.650
Grow up, 007.

30:39.270 --> 30:43.330
Attention. Engine running.
Please shut door now.

30:43.410 --> 30:45.310
Don't let her push you around.

30:55.790 --> 31:00.120
Anyway, there's absolutely no
truth in this malicious rumor...

31:00.190 --> 31:02.720
that I started running Mad
Cow Disease stories...

31:02.830 --> 31:06.700
simply because Sir Angus Black,
the great British beef baron...

31:06.760 --> 31:10.390
Lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game
of poker and refused to pay up.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.200
Moreover, there's even
less truth in the rumor...

31:14.270 --> 31:16.240
that I took 100 million
francs from the French...

31:16.310 --> 31:18.540
to keep the stories
running for another year.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.370
Excuse me, Mr. Carver. Yes.

31:21.450 --> 31:24.310
This is the new banker, Mr...

31:24.380 --> 31:27.280
Bond. James Bond.

31:27.390 --> 31:30.410
Another new banker. I seem to collect them.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.720
Tell me, Mr. Bond.

31:33.790 --> 31:36.260
How's the market reacting to the crisis?

31:36.360 --> 31:39.420
Well, currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.770
I don't believe we have met.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.930
- Elliot Carver.
- Wai Lin.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.130
I'm from the New China News Agency.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.300
I don't recall seeing your
name on the guest list.

31:50.370 --> 31:51.970
I have a confession.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.440
It's not. I snuck in.

31:55.510 --> 31:58.070
Why would you do that, my dear?

31:58.150 --> 32:00.080
I wanted to meet you.

32:00.180 --> 32:02.120
Outstanding.

32:02.190 --> 32:05.090
I admire a woman who takes the initiative.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.590
You should work in my Beijing bureau.
Mr. Carver.

32:08.690 --> 32:12.320
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing.
- Call me Elliot.

32:23.470 --> 32:26.930
I always wondered how I'd
feel if I ever saw you again.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.280
Now I know.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.050
Was it something I said?

32:41.130 --> 32:43.690
How about the words, "I'll be right back?"

32:46.760 --> 32:50.130
- Something came up.
- Something always came up.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.230
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.

32:54.310 --> 32:56.240
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?

32:56.310 --> 33:00.140
Mr. Bond will have a vodka
martini, shaken not stirred.

33:00.210 --> 33:03.510
Mrs. Carver will have a
tequila, straight shot.

33:03.580 --> 33:08.280
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.

33:10.020 --> 33:12.080
I see you've moved up in the world, Paris.

33:12.190 --> 33:15.130
And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.

33:16.730 --> 33:19.750
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

33:31.780 --> 33:34.440
To you. No, to the gun.

33:40.820 --> 33:43.580
So I take it this isn't a social visit?

33:43.690 --> 33:45.680
Your husband may be in trouble.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.220
The emperor of the air.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.850
If you think you're going after him,
you're the one who's in trouble.

33:50.930 --> 33:54.660
Perhaps, but it's either him or
someone in his organization.

33:54.730 --> 33:58.070
I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.

33:58.140 --> 34:00.930
No. That wasn't my plan.

34:01.010 --> 34:03.440
Good. Because if it comes to a choice...

34:03.510 --> 34:05.870
between you and Elliot, I've made my bed.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.210
You don't sleep in it anymore.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.870
There you are.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.870
Darling.

34:16.550 --> 34:18.560
I've been looking everywhere for you.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.949
I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.

34:22.030 --> 34:24.790
Hello, Mrs. Carver. It's a pleasure.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.330
And this is James Bond.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.989
I didn't realize you knew each other.

34:30.070 --> 34:31.969
- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.400
He dated my roommate in Zurich.

34:35.969 --> 34:39.739
I'm thinking of getting Wai
Lin behind a news desk.

34:39.810 --> 34:42.239
That's wonderful. I'm
sure she won't resist...

34:43.280 --> 34:44.270
too much.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.219
Tell me, Elliot, I was just
wondering about your satellites...

34:49.320 --> 34:51.790
the way you've positioned
yourself globally.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.880
They're merely tools for
information, Mr. Bond.

34:54.989 --> 34:56.550
Or disinformation.

34:56.659 --> 35:01.030
Say, if you wanted to manipulate the
course of governments or people.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.090
Or even a ship.

35:05.070 --> 35:08.000
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.

35:08.070 --> 35:11.740
You have a vivid imagination for a banker.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.280
Perhaps I should commission
you to write a novel.

35:14.350 --> 35:18.280
Oh, heavens, no. I'd be lost at sea.
Adrift.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.920
It's time to begin the festivities.

35:28.990 --> 35:30.520
Excuse me. Darling?

35:35.570 --> 35:37.690
So, how do you really know him?

35:37.770 --> 35:40.790
I told you, he's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.

35:40.870 --> 35:43.000
You're a terrible liar, dear.

35:45.780 --> 35:49.110
I have a problem with a banker.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.910
Could I see you a moment?

35:51.980 --> 35:54.580
Ladies and gentlemen.

35:56.820 --> 36:01.510
Mr. Carver's broadcast will be starting
in ten minutes in the main studio.

36:03.460 --> 36:06.900
Exactly what kind of banking do
you specialize in, Mr. Bond?

36:08.470 --> 36:12.490
Hostile takeovers. Shall we?

36:22.380 --> 36:25.280
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.820
It's nice to talk to the world.

36:29.790 --> 36:33.220
Looks like there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

36:35.930 --> 36:38.390
Mr. Bond, you have an urgent phone call.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.130
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in five...

36:48.340 --> 36:51.740
four, three, two...

36:51.810 --> 36:53.740
Good evening.

36:53.810 --> 36:57.540
Tonight's broadcast was
supposed to be a celebration...

36:57.620 --> 37:01.380
marking the completion of the
Carver Global Satellite Network.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.980
But, as you're well aware...

37:04.090 --> 37:07.150
a terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea...

37:07.260 --> 37:08.950
which, unchecked...

37:09.030 --> 37:14.760
has the potential to destroy
every human being on Earth.

37:14.830 --> 37:18.430
I want to assure my viewers that I...
This way, please.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.870
Elliot Carver, have spoken with
the prime minister in London...

37:21.940 --> 37:23.870
and the chairman in Beijing...

37:23.940 --> 37:26.570
and have offered my
services as an impartial...

37:29.480 --> 37:33.080
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond.
Nobody hears you scream.

37:37.860 --> 37:41.310
Herr Stamper, we have made contact.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.920
Make him uncomfortable.

37:44.030 --> 37:46.330
I'll be there in a few moments.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.800
With its printing presses
that run 24 hours a day...

37:49.870 --> 37:53.100
and its satellite facilities
linking every last...

37:57.140 --> 38:00.170
You seem very concerned about
Mr. Carver's business.

38:02.850 --> 38:04.680
He wants to know why.

38:04.750 --> 38:08.080
Why did I do it, you ask.

38:08.150 --> 38:10.450
The answer is simple: power.

38:10.550 --> 38:14.350
The power to illuminate the
far corners of the globe.

38:14.430 --> 38:16.360
Not for higher profits...

38:16.430 --> 38:20.890
but for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.

38:20.970 --> 38:23.730
Put him in the chair. Maybe we
play a little number on his head.

38:31.010 --> 38:33.500
And what do I expect in return?

38:33.580 --> 38:36.270
Worldwide domination.

38:36.350 --> 38:40.510
Complete, utter, total
worldwide domination.

38:40.580 --> 38:43.820
But not over governments or ideology.

38:43.920 --> 38:48.360
Over tyranny and isolation and ignorance.

38:50.060 --> 38:52.650
The Carver Media Group
Network has the ability...

38:52.730 --> 38:56.830
to reach every person in every
village in every nation.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.890
But do not fear me...

38:58.970 --> 39:01.530
for tonight I offer you my
declaration of principles:

39:01.610 --> 39:04.840
A promise to the men and
women of this planet...

39:04.910 --> 39:08.210
my brothers and sisters
whom I so humbly serve.

39:08.280 --> 39:13.580
I promise to report the
news without fear or favor.

39:13.650 --> 39:17.180
I promise to be a force
for good in this world...

39:17.290 --> 39:20.850
fighting injustice, crushing intolerance...

39:20.960 --> 39:22.220
battling inhumanity.

39:22.290 --> 39:25.060
It's time for...

39:27.160 --> 39:29.260
a station break.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.640
What's happening? We've lost power.

39:34.710 --> 39:36.900
We're off the air. What?

39:43.810 --> 39:47.770
Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm.
There's no need to go for the exit.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.220
We will go on in a few minutes' time.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.850
What do you mean, you don't know? You're fired!
Get out of my sight!

40:39.870 --> 40:42.810
And, in a rather embarrassing note...

40:42.870 --> 40:46.500
scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver
was cut off the air tonight...

40:46.580 --> 40:49.010
in mid-speech during the
inaugural broadcast...

40:49.080 --> 40:51.980
of his Worldwide Satellite Network.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.680
Sorry, Elliot, but we didn't do it.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.390
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

40:59.460 --> 41:01.720
Come on, Elliot. Ignore those people.

41:01.790 --> 41:04.490
- Sometimes these things happen.
- Not to me.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.500
Not to me!

41:15.710 --> 41:20.470
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

41:20.540 --> 41:26.380
It was a rag, but the editor
taught me one important lesson.

41:26.450 --> 41:29.580
The key to a great story is not who...

41:29.690 --> 41:31.920
or what or when...

41:33.590 --> 41:35.060
but why.

41:36.260 --> 41:40.590
Your friend, Mr. Bond, made a mess tonight.

41:41.770 --> 41:45.760
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.

41:47.770 --> 41:49.260
Barely?

42:16.630 --> 42:19.900
I was curious who Carver would send.

42:20.870 --> 42:22.530
He's on to you.

42:23.870 --> 42:27.040
Well, we know where you stand.

42:27.110 --> 42:29.910
You made your bed.

42:31.150 --> 42:34.280
I'm standing in your doorway.

42:37.620 --> 42:39.560
Then turn around and go home.

42:41.630 --> 42:43.750
You can tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.590
That's it? Go home?

42:51.170 --> 42:53.970
I didn't ask you to get involved in this.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.440
It's too late for that.

43:04.780 --> 43:06.720
Why did you marry him?

43:06.780 --> 43:09.720
He told me he loved me.

43:09.820 --> 43:12.290
That always sounds good.

43:13.660 --> 43:17.590
Do you know I used to look in the
papers every day for your obituary?

43:19.660 --> 43:21.630
Well, I'm sorry I keep disappointing you.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.970
What was it, James?

43:33.510 --> 43:35.880
Did I get too close?

43:40.050 --> 43:43.020
Did I get too close for comfort?

43:55.370 --> 43:56.860
Yes.

44:44.520 --> 44:46.450
I missed you.

44:53.060 --> 44:54.920
What did you find?

44:54.990 --> 44:59.290
I hacked into the mainframe at the bank.
They're using an SSL2 encryption...

44:59.360 --> 45:02.700
Spare me the technobabble, please.

45:02.770 --> 45:05.360
Bond's got a perfect employment record.
Ten years.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.900
He's crossed every "T,"
he's dotted every "I."

45:07.970 --> 45:10.130
- Which means?
- Government agent.

45:10.210 --> 45:13.110
I call it Gupta's Law
of Creative Anomalies.

45:13.180 --> 45:16.110
If it sounds too good to
be true, it always is.

45:17.680 --> 45:19.740
Do you think my wife knows?

45:23.390 --> 45:26.520
There's a lot of garbage, but if
you dial down the ambient noise...

45:27.990 --> 45:31.930
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

45:33.630 --> 45:36.000
Play it again.

45:36.070 --> 45:39.900
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

45:41.840 --> 45:45.400
I think we should set an appointment
for my wife with the doctor.

46:04.290 --> 46:06.590
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

46:06.660 --> 46:08.890
I can get you out of the
country in four hours.

46:08.970 --> 46:10.830
I have no choice.

46:10.900 --> 46:14.340
No one can protect me
from him, not even you.

46:14.400 --> 46:18.240
- You do have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.

46:18.310 --> 46:20.240
I can't do that.

46:23.310 --> 46:26.710
He has a secret lab on the top floor
even I'm not supposed to know about.

46:26.780 --> 46:28.720
There's an emergency hatch on the roof.

46:28.790 --> 46:31.020
- You don't have to do this.
- It's the easiest way to get in.

46:31.120 --> 46:33.060
Don't argue with me, James.

46:35.030 --> 46:36.960
You know...

46:38.400 --> 46:40.330
this job of yours...

46:43.230 --> 46:45.670
it's murder on relationships.

48:06.350 --> 48:08.280
Until I get back next week,
I want two guards...

48:08.350 --> 48:11.720
outside this office 24 hours a day.

48:11.820 --> 48:13.650
Nobody gets in. Got it?

48:13.760 --> 48:15.850
We'll take care of it.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.050
What do we do with the satellite?

48:23.200 --> 48:26.000
Send this thing off to the launch site.
And be careful.

48:26.070 --> 48:30.300
It's worth 300 million dollars. You
break it, you bought it. Understand?

48:30.370 --> 48:32.930
I hate travelling. I
never know what to pack.

50:12.710 --> 50:14.800
Looking for a news story?

52:24.340 --> 52:27.330
They'll print anything these days.

53:29.510 --> 53:31.200
Yes?

53:31.270 --> 53:35.210
Good morning, Mr. Bond. Elliot Carver.

53:35.280 --> 53:38.580
I believe you've got two
items that belong to me.

53:38.650 --> 53:40.670
What are you talking about?

53:40.750 --> 53:43.720
The red box, Mr. Bond...

53:43.820 --> 53:46.620
and my wife in your hotel room.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.000
He's coming.

54:05.940 --> 54:08.310
Fingerprint I.D. accepted.

54:15.850 --> 54:17.880
Please select security system level.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.410
Tell me if you find the encoder.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.540
- Call me immediately.
- Yeah.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.120
And in breaking news...

55:01.200 --> 55:06.230
it is with great sadness that we
announce the death of Paris Carver...

55:06.300 --> 55:08.930
who has become an international
figure since she became the wife...

55:09.010 --> 55:11.270
of Elliot Carver, chairman of this network.

55:12.610 --> 55:15.510
According to police officials
in Hamburg, Germany...

55:15.580 --> 55:17.510
Mrs. Carver was found dead this morning...

55:17.580 --> 55:22.040
in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances...

55:22.120 --> 55:24.710
on which police have refused to elaborate.

55:24.820 --> 55:27.520
A coroner has been called for
and is expected to deliver...

55:27.620 --> 55:31.030
his full report within the next three days.

55:31.090 --> 55:34.830
Her body was discovered along with
the body of an unidentified man...

55:34.900 --> 55:38.060
who appeared to be the victim
of a self-inflicted gun wound.

55:38.130 --> 55:40.430
Reached aboard his private jet en route...

55:40.500 --> 55:43.530
I have a clear shot at your head, Mr. Bond.

55:43.610 --> 55:47.510
Stand up, slowly.

55:47.580 --> 55:50.070
Drop your gun and kick it toward me, ja?

55:50.150 --> 55:52.580
At present, police have
refused to speculate...

55:52.650 --> 55:54.980
on a motive in this murder/suicide.

55:55.050 --> 55:56.880
Good. Now...

55:56.950 --> 55:59.650
lie down on the bed next to Mrs. Carver.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.660
We extend our deepest
sympathies to Mr. Carver.

56:05.600 --> 56:08.220
This story will be on the news in an hour.

56:09.370 --> 56:12.430
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.

56:19.180 --> 56:21.540
My name is Dr. Kaufman.

56:21.610 --> 56:25.010
I am an outstanding pistol marksman.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.240
Take my word for it, ja?

56:32.360 --> 56:34.290
Get the sledgehammers.

56:46.840 --> 56:49.500
She struggled terribly, Mr. Bond.

56:49.570 --> 56:53.100
It's a pity you got her
involved in all this.

56:55.710 --> 56:58.370
It won't look like a suicide if
you shoot me from over there.

56:58.450 --> 57:01.140
I am a professor of forensic medicine.

57:01.220 --> 57:03.780
Believe me, Mr. Bond, I could
shoot you from Stuttgart...

57:03.850 --> 57:06.450
and still create the proper effect.

57:14.530 --> 57:17.520
My art is in great demand, Mr. Bond.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.590
I go all over the world.

57:19.670 --> 57:24.110
I am especially good at
the celebrity overdose.

57:24.170 --> 57:28.670
But now, I'm afraid,
Mr. Bond, that our little...

57:28.750 --> 57:33.840
Stamper! Stop yelling in my ear, ja?

57:33.920 --> 57:36.410
Sir, they can't get into the car.

57:37.390 --> 57:38.980
You can't be serious.

57:39.090 --> 57:42.750
Did you call the Auto Club?
Do you want to call them?

57:42.860 --> 57:44.790
Make him tell you how to open it.

57:44.860 --> 57:46.800
Okay, I ask.

57:48.730 --> 57:50.700
This is very embarrassing.

57:50.770 --> 57:53.000
It seems there is a red box in your car.

57:53.070 --> 57:54.930
They can't get to it.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.940
They want me to make you unlock the car.

57:59.010 --> 58:01.810
I feel like an idiot. I
don't know what to say.

58:03.250 --> 58:06.510
I am to torture you if you don't do it.

58:06.580 --> 58:09.850
- You've a doctorate in that too?
- No, no, no.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.820
This is more like a hobby.
But I'm very gifted.

58:13.890 --> 58:16.220
Oh, I believe you.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.090
- My cell phone opens the car.
- No, Mr. Bond.

58:19.160 --> 58:21.230
I do it, ja?

58:25.800 --> 58:28.400
Recall, three, send.

58:39.320 --> 58:40.780
Wait.

58:40.850 --> 58:43.790
I'm just a professional doing a job.

58:44.590 --> 58:46.150
Me too.

59:15.150 --> 59:16.410
Dr. Kaufman.

59:48.120 --> 59:50.550
Welcome. Please fasten seat belt.

59:57.630 --> 59:58.920
Reduce speed.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.160
Pedestrians in roadway.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.090
Driver alert.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.600
Obstruction ahead. Reduce speed now.

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:34.610
Reminder: Unsafe driving
will void warranty.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.230
Congratulations on a safe journey.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:32.900
U.S. Air Base, South China Sea.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.520
Yo! Jimbo!

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.620
Wade, what are you doing here?

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:54.700
You know the world's my office.
Let's go this way.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.730
Did Q bring you up to speed?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.770
Yeah. I brought along the G.P.S.
calibration unit.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.600
By the way, officially Uncle Sam is
completely neutral in this turkey shoot.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:06.070
And unofficially?

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.270
We have no interest in seeing World
War Three, unless we start it.

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:12.710
Dr. Greenwalt. He's the
Air Force G.P.S. expert.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.720
Sorry about all this security...

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.050
but the G.P.S. encoder is one of the
most closely guarded secrets...

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.550
in the U.S. military.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.490
Show him what you got.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:28.760
Jesus, it's the missing encoder.
How the hell did you get that?

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:31.430
Picked it up in Hamburg yesterday morning.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.870
Could somebody use this to
send a ship off course?

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.460
Like the Devonshire?

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.730
I didn't you hear anybody mention
the Devonshire. Did you?

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.770
- No.
- Good. So just answer his question.

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:45.340
In theory, if you could
alter the timing chip...

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:47.850
you could slowly send a ship off course.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.910
- Like putting a magnet near a compass.
- Yeah, exactly.

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:54.350
Then check this out. Oh, yeah.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.830
Those two circles should be
lining up on top of each other.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.810
Somebody's tampered with your encoder.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.910
If we knew the last time and position
the Devonshire thought she was...

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.740
could you figure out
exactly where she sank?

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.310
Sure.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:22.950
Wade...

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:27.050
I have a small favor to ask.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.600
The high-altitude, low opening jump...
the HALO jump...

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:39.860
is where we get the most
fatalities, so listen up.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.240
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your
oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:45.860
Sounds like my first marriage.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.970
After the free-fall...

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.710
pop the chute at 200 feet,
below the Chinese radar.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.710
You'll be traveling at
over 200 miles an hour.

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.720
This snaps your head
back like a cantaloupe.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.340
Don't crack your skull open on the tanks.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.010
I'll keep that in mind.

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:02.790
One last thing: When you hit the water
don't forget to cut away your chute.

01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:07.450
90% of people killed in the HALO jump got
tangled in their chutes and drowned.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.790
Got it?

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:11.060
Seems like a lot just to save the world.

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:12.730
I've got no choice.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.900
I have to prove that ship was
deliberately set off course.

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:17.200
One minute!

01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:19.170
- Is the pickup set?
- You bet.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.340
After your mission, turn on your beacon.
The extraction team will pick you up.

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:27.650
Buddha bless!

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.010
- I just noticed something.
- Yeah?

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.710
This is where the ship thought it was.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.190
This is where it really is.
But see that island?

01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:38.660
Yeah. That means where he's jumping...

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.390
between the British and Chinese fleets...

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.760
Technically they're not in
Chinese territorial waters.

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:46.460
- They belong to Vietnam.
- Vietnam?

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.740
Does he have any U.S.
government markings on him?

01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:51.900
The parachute, the wet suit, the fins.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:55.210
If the Vietnamese catch him,
they're gonna go crazy.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.640
He didn't even say good-bye.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.340
Still interested in hostile takeovers?

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.550
It's the opportunities for travel
that I like best about banking.

01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.450
Bring the boat.

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:36.080
What are you waiting for?

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.030
Get them out of the water.

01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:08.950
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
were following me around, Mr. Bond.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.030
You'll have to admit, though...

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:14.190
we seem to have developed a
certain attachment to each other.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.360
Hopefully not for long.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.760
Another Carver building.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.470
If I didn't know better, I'd say
he'd developed an edifice complex.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:51.300
- General Chang?
- Friend of yours?

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:56.040
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.

01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:59.400
Welcome to Saigon.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:01.410
It's always nice to see you, Elliot.

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:05.010
I hadn't intended opening
this center until tomorrow...

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.950
but as you're here you can help me
to write the inaugural story...

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.640
your obituaries.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.520
I hope you extended the
same courtesy to Paris.

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:19.720
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one
who wrote my late wife's obituary...

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:21.690
when you asked her to betray me.

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:24.790
Still, let's see...

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.990
"British secret service
agent James Bond..."

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.160
and his collaborator Wai Lin...

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.170
of the Chinese People's
External Security Force...

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.770
were found...

01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:37.880
dead this morning...

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.880
"in Vietnam."

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:44.680
Lacks punch, don't you think?

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:48.710
It's old news, Elliot. We've been
working together for months.

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.790
Both our governments know what
you and General Chang are up to.

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.660
I don't think so.

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.000
You may have seen the general
in the hallway just now...

01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:00.230
but perhaps, with all
your jetting around...

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:03.430
you've not had chance to
peruse today's headlines.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:12.380
I rather like the last one.
It isn't even mine.

01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:14.540
I never believe what I
read in the press anyway.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.740
Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:22.260
We're both men of action, but your
era and Miss Lin's is passing.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.530
Words are the new weapons,
satellites the new artillery.

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:30.090
And you become the new
supreme allied commander?

01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:31.530
Exactly!

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.540
Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies...

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:38.570
I have my divisions... TV, news, magazines.

01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:42.770
And by midnight I'll have reached
and influenced more people...

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.540
than anyone in the history of
this planet, save God Himself.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:50.280
And the best He ever managed
was the Sermon on the Mount.

01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:51.880
You really are quite insane.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:56.190
The distance between insanity and genius...

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.230
is measured only by success.

01:14:58.290 --> 01:14:59.620
Excuse me.

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.950
General Chang is waiting.

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:04.070
If you'll forgive me,

01:15:04.071 --> 01:15:07.840
your appearance here has forced me...
to move up my timetable slightly.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:11.570
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Mr. Stamper and his toys.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.230
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.870
Sir. The helicopter.

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.240
Thanks, Gupta.

01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:20.370
Mr. Stamper is a protege
of the late Dr. Kaufman...

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:23.610
who was schooling him in the
ancient art of chakra torture.

01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:26.620
He was like a father to me.

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:29.820
Really? Interesting role model.

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:32.990
According to Eastern philosophy,
the body has seven chakra points.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.330
Energy centers, like the heart or genitals.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.730
The purpose of these implements
is to probe those organs...

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.000
inflicting the maximum amount of pain...

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.230
whilst keeping the victim alive
for as long as possible.

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:47.800
Dr. Kaufman's record was 52 hours.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.670
I'm hoping to break it.

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:54.440
I would've thought watching your
TV shows was torture enough.

01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:57.280
Save this one till last.

01:15:58.350 --> 01:16:00.410
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:04.650
there should be just enough time
for him to watch it stop beating.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.190
Excuse me.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.510
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.160
We can use the banner.

01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:50.670
Hope it holds.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.230
- Get after them!
- Ready? Go!

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.970
Next time I'll take the elevator.

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:28.740
Push! Push!

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.160
- Get a car!
- No, no!

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:52.600
- Yes, a car!
- A bike is quicker.

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:56.000
The keys. Someone always forgets them.

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:58.730
What are you doing? I'm driving. Get off.

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:01.700
Get on the back.

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:06.310
I'm slipping.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.280
Stop fidgeting back there.

01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:15.020
What are you...

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.580
Give me that.

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.720
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!

01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:20.350
- Turn right.
- No, left.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.430
Who's driving? Come on!

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.320
Clutch!

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.990
Left! Left!

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:07.700
How many back there?

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.770
I can't see. Hold on.

01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:14.210
What are you... What?

01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:19.790
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.520
One... No, two.

01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:31.100
Go for the barrels. What?

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.370
Very good.

01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:57.880
Hold on!

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.760
Let's take the highway.

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:30.520
Helicopter! All right, keep your shirt on.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.500
- Get on the back of the bike.
- Are you trying to protect me?

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.070
No. I need to balance the bike.
Get on the back.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.520
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:35.780
Go!

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.900
Pop the clutch.

01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:21.060
It's behind us.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.600
Move!

01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:27.140
Get out of the way!

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.540
You see the chopper?

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.710
I can't see. Hold on.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.210
What are you...

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:23.630
Trapped.

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:27.730
Never.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.650
Would you pass the soap?

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.990
Over there.

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:28.790
You were pretty good with that hook.

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:32.130
It comes from growing up
in a rough neighborhood.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.460
You were pretty good on the bike.

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:38.440
Well, that comes from
not growing up at all.

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:40.500
Here. Allow me.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.450
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.

01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:47.450
Just off the cuff, I
thought we might link up.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.720
Work hand in hand?

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:54.190
Stick closer to each other.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:56.190
Maybe we go after General Chang together.

01:24:58.290 --> 01:24:59.950
Your turn.

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:02.030
Thanks for washing my hair.

01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:05.270
I work alone.

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.970
Lucky for you I stopped by.

01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:40.920
I could've taken care of him.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.850
But you didn't.

01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:46.860
Give me the earring.

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.720
Copy of a Makarov 59.
Standard issue, Chinese Army.

01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:55.890
Looks like General Chang wants you dead.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.160
You still think you can do this alone?

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.700
It depends whether your
mission is peace or revenge.

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:04.210
This is about stopping a war.

01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:12.310
Last year we found stealth
material was missing...

01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:14.650
from one of General Chang's bases.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.190
I followed a lead to Carver's
headquarters in Hamburg.

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:18.850
Stealth material?

01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:20.890
We thought he was building a stealth plane.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.020
No. Stealth boat.

01:28:25.130 --> 01:28:27.120
That's the only way they could
get close to the Devonshire...

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.570
so they could drill
inside the missile room.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.440
Remember? They stole a cruise
missile from that ship.

01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:36.410
He said he was moving the
timetable forward to midnight.

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.540
Yes, of course he did.

01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:40.880
Under cover of darkness he'll
position the stealth boat...

01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:42.680
near the British fleet...

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:45.380
fire the missile into China.

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:49.360
- And we will retaliate.
- And Carver will provide the pictures.

01:28:50.190 --> 01:28:52.060
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No.

01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:54.620
Let's warn both our
governments, get them talking.

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:56.530
It'll give us time to find the boat.

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:57.590
Stand up.

01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:21.210
It's just like home.

01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:23.720
You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.930
On second thought...

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.260
you type.

01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:35.030
First we find the boat.

01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:39.400
Of all the harbors and inlets
controlled by General Chang...

01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:43.310
22 are in highly populated areas.

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:46.010
That leaves 14 where he
could hide a stealth boat.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.010
You can see it during the day.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.520
It's invisible to radar,
but not the human eye.

01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:54.850
Very novel.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.950
He'd have to hide it someplace...

01:29:58.030 --> 01:30:00.360
where he could sail to the
Devonshire and back in one night.

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:03.290
This looks familiar.

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.300
We've made some improvements.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.160
Have you, indeed?

01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:11.470
Okay. Four hours out and four hours back.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:15.600
Let's assume the boat is traveling
at a speed of 30 knots.

01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:21.010
I've always been a fan
of Chinese technology.

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:23.850
According to this...

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.610
there are four places where
he could harbor the boat.

01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:28.550
Up on your left.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.720
Run a cross check on those
areas for anything suspicious.

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.830
The new Walther.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.000
I asked Q for one of these.

01:30:57.850 --> 01:31:00.250
I've got it. Look.

01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:04.220
Four missing boats. Three
unexplained drownings.

01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:05.550
That has to be it.

01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:09.560
Ha Long Bay.

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.850
He knows the island.

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:31.780
He says that it's dangerous for boats
to be around there at sunset...

01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:34.950
but for 5,000 American dollars...

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.460
he'll take us.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.720
Good.

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:39.730
Maybe he'll take a check.

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:57.140
It's mostly dull routine, of course...

01:31:57.210 --> 01:32:01.150
but every now and then you get to sail
on a beautiful evening like this...

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:05.620
and sometimes work with a decadent
agent of a corrupt Western power.

01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:08.250
And they say Communists
don't know how to have fun.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.110
I hate to disappoint you...

01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:13.660
but I don't even have a little red book.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.130
If anything happens to me...

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.670
the fuses for the mines are in here.

01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:26.900
We're gonna finish this together.

01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:29.940
And if I may say so, you found the right...

01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:33.470
decadent, corrupt Western agent...

01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:35.480
as a partner.

01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.660
- See the stealth?
- No.

01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:01.370
It's getting late and this
is the last cove in the bay.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.650
Yeah, that's it.

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.480
Set the timers for ten minutes.

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:45.540
That'll give us time to get out
of here before the ship explodes.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.320
Even if it doesn't sink,
it'll show up on radar.

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:51.320
Our fleets will finish the job.
If they got our message.

01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:54.330
Okay, you, up and over. Okay.

01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:12.180
We're in position between the fleets.

01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:16.380
Fire one missile at the
flagship of each fleet.

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:20.350
The Chinese will think the British
are rattling the saber...

01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:24.120
the British will think the
Chinese are being belligerent...

01:34:24.190 --> 01:34:28.130
and the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.

01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:32.430
Let the mayhem begin.

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:43.910
Missile lock-on.

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:48.310
Send a signal to the Admiralty:
"Task group under missile attack."

01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:53.819
Sir, AWACS reports two waves
of land-based MIG 21s inbound.

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:56.080
The first group should be on
our screens in two minutes.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.390
How long before the MiGs are within
firing range of the British fleet?

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:01.550
Twelve minutes.

01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.590
What the hell do I pay you for?

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.500
If she's there, Bond is there.

01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:13.130
Stamper, find them.

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:21.740
Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!

01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:32.930
If she blinks, kill her.

01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:34.860
You come with me.

01:36:20.770 --> 01:36:24.070
Stamper to Bridge. Bond is dead.

01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.540
Delicious.

01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:29.010
Make sure you clear all the mines,
and bring the girl up to me.

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.550
Are you sure you want her up here?

01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:39.360
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.

01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:41.260
I like an audience.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.670
Miss Lin.

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.500
Your countrymen are being so cooperative...

01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:55.010
so predictably eager to save face.

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.370
My government knows you're out here.
They're looking for you.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.250
Not according to our radar...

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.720
where it seems your MiGs are about
to attack the British fleet...

01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:07.450
in how many minutes?

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.579
Nine minutes to firing range.

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:12.290
And even if they were looking for me...

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.920
we're on a stealth boat.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.590
They can't see me, or you...

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.100
or even your friend...

01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:21.630
the late Commander Bond...

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:26.330
who is at this moment on his way to
the bottom of the South China Sea.

01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:29.380
He's my new anchorman.

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:43.380
Pathetic.

01:37:47.730 --> 01:37:49.890
What on earth's going on?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.400
A message from 007...

01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:55.400
just confirmed by my
opposite number in China.

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:59.770
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship
that's almost invisible to radar."

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.270
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.780
Carver's been playing both sides for fools.

01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:10.820
Admiral, sir, urgent message
from the Admiralty.

01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:14.480
Look at this.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.390
Anything on radar that looks very small?
Lifeboat, periscope, anything?

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:23.930
No, sir. Stealth boat, sir?
They have gone mad.

01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:35.870
What you're about to witness, Miss Lin,
is not so much a missile attack...

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:37.930
but the launch of a new world order.

01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:42.779
In five minutes, after your countrymen
have attacked the British fleet...

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:46.050
I shall retaliate for dear old England...

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.950
by sending this missile into Beijing...

01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:52.460
where General Chang has just
called an emergency meeting...

01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:54.690
of the Chinese high command.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.350
Unfortunately...

01:38:57.830 --> 01:39:00.990
General Chang will be delayed in traffic...

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:05.870
arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders...

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:10.340
and too late to stop the air force
from sinking the entire British fleet.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.210
But he will be just in time to take over
the government, negotiate a truce...

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.010
and emerge as a world leader...

01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:21.650
with a Nobel Peace Prize.

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.920
- And what do you get?
- Me?

01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:26.730
Oh, nothing.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:32.420
Just exclusive broadcasting rights
in China for the next hundred years.

01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:36.800
Ready to rock and ruin.

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:41.370
If you'll excuse me, my dear, I have
something of a deadline to meet.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.000
Prepare for the missile launch.

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.940
Mr. Gupta.

01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:50.380
Hello, Elliot.

01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:52.750
Interesting plan.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.290
But I think I have something of yours.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.590
So much for German efficiency. Mr. Stamper.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.170
- Don't shoot him yet.
- Hold your fire.

01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:14.540
Welcome to my world crisis, Mr. Bond.

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.300
Even trade, Elliot.

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.240
Gupta for Wai Lin.

01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:20.940
You can't fire the missile without him.

01:40:21.010 --> 01:40:24.640
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.

01:40:26.150 --> 01:40:28.250
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.490
I told you we're going
to finish this together.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.550
Oh, how romantic.

01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:37.720
Do you realize how absurd your position is?

01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:40.490
No more absurd than
starting a war for ratings.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.540
Great men have always manipulated
the media to save the world.

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:48.899
Look at William Randolph Hearst,
who told his photographers...

01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:52.440
"You provide the pictures,
I'll provide the war."

01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:54.740
I've just taken it one step further.

01:40:58.650 --> 01:40:59.780
Sorry about that.

01:40:59.850 --> 01:41:03.310
I tuned out there for a moment, Elliot.

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:05.190
Touche.

01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:07.420
Mr. Gupta...

01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:09.260
is the missile ready to fire?

01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:12.260
Press the magic button, Beijing disappears.

01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:15.960
Then it seems you've
outlived your contract.

01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:21.370
You see, Mr. Bond, I have a backup plan.

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.270
So do I.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.330
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.000
Sir, we have a small, intermittent
contact on the surface.

01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:56.910
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.140
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear
it wasn't there a second ago, sir.

01:42:01.210 --> 01:42:05.380
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on
the Chinese for any reason whatsoever.

01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:08.150
Send the message to the
Chinese fleet commander:

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:09.710
"Have sighted unknown ship..."

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:12.660
Get those fires out!

01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:14.820
Get down there and protect the missile.

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:19.420
Oh, and Mr. Stamper, would you
please kill those bastards?

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.110
Nice work.

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.510
They're speeding up.

01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:46.750
We have to stop the boat. Can you
take care of the engine room?

01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:49.350
- Of course.
- Good. Do it and get off the ship.

01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:53.170
I'm going to stop the missile.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.210
Signal from the Chinese fleet commander.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.810
"To Royal Navy Task Group:."

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:11.780
We also have the unknown
ship on our screens.

01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:14.950
We will not fire unless
it turns toward China.

01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:16.820
"Until then, she's yours."

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:20.220
Now, Captain, whatever the
hell that thing is, sink it.

01:43:20.290 --> 01:43:23.750
- Right, sir.
- Is that echo too weak for missile lock?

01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:25.160
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:27.290
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

01:43:34.410 --> 01:43:36.970
Bond turned us into the target.

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.010
Along with himself.

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.710
Take evasive action.

01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:44.110
Prepare the missile countdown immediately.

01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:48.750
Initializing launch sequence. "T"
minus five minutes and counting.

01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:52.310
"T" minus five minutes and counting.

01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:54.520
Sir, they're making 48 knots.

01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:57.150
They'll be out of range in two minutes.

01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:59.290
Keep firing. Slow them down.

01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:05.220
The engines are out. We're
sitting ducks here. Engine room.

01:45:46.110 --> 01:45:47.440
Follow me!

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:39.080
"T" minus four minutes and counting.

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:26.120
Well done. Officer Watch, increase max.

01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:27.470
Keep firing!

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.300
All hands, abandon ship.

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.040
Abandon ship.

01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.710
Mr. Stamper, what are you
doing about the girl?

01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:04.210
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:11.210
"T" minus three minutes and counting.

01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:06.770
You're too late again, Mr. Bond.

01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:10.230
It's a bad habit of yours.

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:12.180
There's nothing you can do.

01:49:20.190 --> 01:49:24.090
"T" minus two minutes and counting.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.320
The missile's fully programmed.

01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:28.520
It can't be stopped.

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.760
In minutes my plan will succeed.

01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:34.760
Thanks largely to your efforts...

01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:37.230
the British Navy will
destroy the evidence...

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:41.270
and I'll be out of here in a
Carver news helicopter...

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.330
covering the event.

01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:45.670
It's going to be a fantastic show.

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:48.680
I may have some breaking
news for you, Elliot.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:57.980
You forgot the first rule
of mass media, Elliot...

01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:02.730
Give the people what they want.

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:20.250
"T" minus one minute and counting.

01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:36.150
Drop it, Mr. Bond...

01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:37.860
or I drop your friend.

01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:41.260
It's over, Stamper.

01:50:41.370 --> 01:50:42.990
Let her go.

01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:44.630
Not between you and me.

01:50:46.610 --> 01:50:50.270
James, try the detonators. The
missile will set them off.

01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:53.510
Never argue with a woman.
They're always right.

01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:11.360
"T" minus 40 seconds.

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:19.360
For Carver!

01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:24.140
And Kaufman!

01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:36.980
I owe you an unpleasant death, Mr. Bond.

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:23.670
"T" minus 20 seconds.

01:52:26.610 --> 01:52:28.800
We die together, Mr. Bond.

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.980
"T" minus ten seconds.

01:53:06.810 --> 01:53:08.370
Three...

01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:11.010
two... one...

01:54:04.570 --> 01:54:07.510
M, Bedford reports Carver
went down with the ship.

01:54:07.570 --> 01:54:09.510
Seems that Bond made it.

01:54:11.710 --> 01:54:13.740
Moneypenny, take this release.

01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:16.250
Elliot Carver is missing,
presumed drowned...

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:21.080
while on a cruise aboard his luxury
yacht in the South China Sea.

01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:25.190
At present the local authorities believe...

01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:27.690
the media mogul committed suicide.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.740
Commander Bond...

01:54:40.670 --> 01:54:42.540
Colonel Lin...

01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:45.010
this is the H.M.S. Bedford.

01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:48.680
Are you there?

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:53.750
They're looking for us, James.

01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.010
Let's stay under cover.
