WEBVTT

00:03.253 --> 00:04.713
KELLY:
<i>What's up?</i>

00:04.796 --> 00:08.633
{\an3}Uh, well, there have
been some changes.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.135
Let me fill you in.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.429
Well, you know Mrs. Merill
is running the board now.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.597
Right. She's an advocate
of free clinics.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.435
She has a new pet project:
illiteracy.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.769
But kids can't even go to school

00:19.853 --> 00:20.937
if they don't have
their immunizations.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.063
They won't let them in.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.773
Tastes change.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.608
Your budget's been cut.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.069
{\an3}Yeah.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.821
You're gonna have
to restrict your hours.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.156
If we do that, it'll be harder
for people to come

00:32.240 --> 00:33.324
and get treatment.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.785
If they come here for family
planning or an infection,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.163
if our doors are closed,
they're not gonna come back.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.330
If they're sick, they will.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.167
Not if, say, they have a
sexually transmitted disease.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.293
In a few days,

00:43.376 --> 00:44.461
the symptoms will disappear,

00:44.544 --> 00:45.712
but the disease hasn't.

00:45.795 --> 00:49.090
They have no way of knowing
that it still needs treatment.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.967
Kelly, I've had this same
conversation today

00:51.050 --> 00:53.803
with Dr. Martin.
He's as upset as you are.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.472
But if you implement

00:55.555 --> 00:57.432
these cuts immediately,
that buys you time

00:57.515 --> 00:59.309
to file for grants.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.519
My suggestion?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.813
Start with the nursing staff.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.940
You're firing Barbara?

01:06.024 --> 01:07.734
I'm afraid that's not my job.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.612
Ah, you're making it mine.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.617
Great.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.621
You're gonna get burned.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.289
It's ice coffee.
No, if you tell

01:21.372 --> 01:22.582
your mom the truth.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.001
David, I'm sick of lying.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.503
Val, your father was forcing
himself on you

01:26.586 --> 01:28.171
even after you told him
you'd go to the cops.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.507
And I threatened that
a lot near the end,

01:30.590 --> 01:31.633
but I never did it.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.884
I shot him instead.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.010
He had a gun.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.512
You were just
protecting yourself.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.263
And I'll tell her that.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.433
{\an3}(sighs) Well,
the airport said

01:40.517 --> 01:42.060
the plane was on time.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.520
You want to clear
your conscience?

01:43.603 --> 01:44.687
You should talk to a lawyer.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.482
It's gotta be justifiable
homicide.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.275
David, my mother lost everything
that night:

01:49.359 --> 01:52.237
my father, me... in a way.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.863
{\an3}I mean, this lie has
been wedged between us.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.865
I want to her to know.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.700
I want her to say
that she understands.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.869
You think you got away
with something? You didn't.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.164
It's full-time job hating
yourself for what you did.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.666
And I'm tired of doing it.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.210
So stop. Don't give the job
to someone else.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.419
(doorbell rings)

02:09.503 --> 02:11.673
{\an3}(sighs)

02:15.802 --> 02:16.845
{\an1}Mom!

02:16.928 --> 02:18.054
The flight was early,

02:18.137 --> 02:19.889
{\an3}and the rental car
was right there, so...

02:19.973 --> 02:21.599
{\an3}(gasps)

02:21.683 --> 02:25.061
Oh, sweetheart!
Mm.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.606
(big sigh)

02:28.690 --> 02:29.941
I really needed you,

02:30.024 --> 02:31.609
and you came.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.570
{\an3}Babe, you wanted
this from the car?

02:33.653 --> 02:35.113
Who is this?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.614
Honey, this is
Carl Schmidt.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.075
This is my daughter
Valerie and David.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.243
Hi.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.872
{\an3}Mom, I said I really
needed to talk to you.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.248
We'll go to a nice dinner.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.417
We can talk about whatever
you want. It'll be nice.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.626

03:25.705 --> 03:28.499

{\an3}Hey.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.064
Hey.

04:33.147 --> 04:33.690
And where were you?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.191
I had a early appointment.

04:35.274 --> 04:37.860
{\an3}I can see that.
I like it.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.988
{\an1}Thanks. I didn't want
to wake you.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.489
{\an1}You barely slept
last night.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.658
{\an3}You know, I was
thinking about it.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.536
I mean, my father must have
some money squirreled away.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.704
(sighs)
You're worried.

04:47.787 --> 04:48.705
I still got,

04:48.788 --> 04:50.707
you know, a place to live,
I got the club.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.041
I think you should call them.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.584
Your dad said
they lost everything

04:53.668 --> 04:54.711
Well, it's a relative term.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.380
I mean, you know, they'll
forego the homes in Europe

04:57.463 --> 04:58.673
for five-star hotels. Big deal.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.216
Are they in trouble or not?

05:00.299 --> 05:02.010
I don't know.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.678
Then call. It's gonna
make you feel better.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.847
I already did.
They never called me back.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.557
Maybe they're embarrassed.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.851
I think you should try again.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.562
I hear what you're saying,
but I'm way ahead of you.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.732
Then go to them. Show them
they haven't lost everything.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.905
{\an3}See, if I don't get
the check today,

05:22.989 --> 05:24.907
all the used books
are gonna be gone.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.243
{\an1}Well, Sophie, if you need
some cash for books...

05:27.326 --> 05:28.578
{\an3}(chuckles)
Listen to you: cash,

05:28.661 --> 05:29.954
{\an3}chauffeur service,
free digs.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.331
{\an3}You're too sexy to
be a guardian angel.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.458
Well, that's a relief.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.585
If there's anything
I can do, though...

05:35.668 --> 05:37.587
No, the student loan
is going to cover it.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.713
{\an3}Have I said
thank you

05:38.796 --> 05:39.881
{\an3}in the last
five minutes?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.549
{\an1}Yeah, on the way
over here.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.259
Hey, you're gonna
be late for work.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.594
I'm the boss.
It's a perk.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.096
{\an3}You're also a distraction.
I need to focus.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.599
Cut in line for registration,
fight for the used books,

05:49.682 --> 05:52.602
{\an3}be generally ill-tempered,
studious.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.562
All right, well,
have at it, then.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.772
All right.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.440
{\an3}Hmm.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.608
{\an3}Soph,

05:58.691 --> 05:59.734
what time you through here?

05:59.817 --> 06:00.610
You want to do something
tonight?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.904
I'll see you at home.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.492
{\an1}Hi.
Hey. Name?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.951
Sophie Burns.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.369
I need to pick up
my student loan.

06:10.453 --> 06:10.953
I.D., please.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.997
{\an3}Right.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.632
{\an1}Funds are wired
into your school account.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.509
You can draw off it for books,
tuition, lab costs.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.595
{\an1}Anything that's left over,
we can cut you a check.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.890
Great. I'll take the check
for the full amount.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.975
$5,000?

06:33.059 --> 06:36.604
Yeah. Isn't the government
great?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.820
{\an3}So from here on six,
Mm-hmm.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.489
{\an3}we drop this ad
maybe to...

06:46.572 --> 06:48.491
{\an3}Hi, Kel.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.492
{\an1}Hey.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.868
Hey, how are you?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.995
Good, good.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
I just need to steal
Brandon for a second.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.793
{\an3}Been thinking
about you.

06:58.876 --> 06:59.794
Brandon, don't.

06:59.877 --> 07:00.837
{\an1}I haven't called
'cause...

07:00.920 --> 07:02.505
'Cause I asked you not to.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.048
{\an3}Now I show up
at your office.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.842
{\an3}But don't worry,
this isn't about us.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.468
I wouldn't mind if it was.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.219
{\an3}I would.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.012
It's about work.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.014
The Wyatt Foundation
slashed our funding.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.100
{\an3}We'll run dry in two,
maybe three weeks

07:14.183 --> 07:15.226
if I don't do anything.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.310
Any ideas?

07:16.394 --> 07:17.353
Well, I think that

07:17.436 --> 07:18.729
publicity would help.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.815
Half the city's clinics
closed down in '95,

07:20.898 --> 07:22.567
and only a handful
of them reopened.

07:22.650 --> 07:23.734
Sounds like a story.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.404
Public support, put a little
squeeze on the foundation

07:26.487 --> 07:28.531
{\an1}for backing out.
Let's get started.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.366
Can't you do it alone?

07:30.449 --> 07:32.660
{\an1}I'd like your help
on this, Kel.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.662
We'll take the afternoon.
We'll call the patients.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.998
I could really use you to help
me fine-tune the questions.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.749
So, we're talking
about working together.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.543
I'm not suggesting
we incorporate.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.920
Or doing anything
legally binding, God forbid.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.508
Sorry.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.593
I came to you.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.512
I really need your help,
Brandon.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.056
We can do this, Kel.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.558
Do you want to try?

07:55.641 --> 07:59.729
Okay, but it so the exception
to the rule.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.022
{\an3}Kelly?

08:01.105 --> 08:02.607
{\an3}Boy, you've been
keeping a low profile.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.482
Hi.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.735
Now I'm asking favors
all over town.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.819
Do you know anything
about charity auctions?

08:06.903 --> 08:09.780
Well, I went to one
on Martha's Vineyard one time.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.407
And they auctioned stuff
like clothes,

08:11.490 --> 08:14.911
and dinners, and then weird
things like motorcycle rides

08:14.994 --> 08:16.037
with Dan Aykroyd.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.705
Cool. What's the cause?

08:17.788 --> 08:18.581
Saving the clinic.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.916
Ah.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.125
Donna already talked to Noah

08:21.209 --> 08:22.418
about using the After Dark,

08:22.501 --> 08:24.045
{\an3}and she's donating
some of her designs.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.421
{\an1}I'm sure
we could wring

08:25.504 --> 08:27.590
{\an1}some free product
out of our advertisers.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.051
Goodwill and free promotion,
you're gonna need an auctioneer.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.427
You got the job.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.720
Uh, I'm busy with Sophie.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.096
You know, it's a big bad town
out there,

08:34.179 --> 08:35.890
and I'm just the guy
to show it to her.

08:35.972 --> 08:37.099
{\an3}Try David.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.726
Thanks.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.604
{\an3}Okay, I'm gonna go
hit up some retailers.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.481
But we'll start
this afternoon?

08:43.563 --> 08:44.565
Sounds good.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.609
{\an1}We're, um,
we're okay, right?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.903
{\an3}Guess we're about
to find out.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.505
Sophie!

09:07.588 --> 09:09.423
{\an1}Sophie!

09:09.507 --> 09:12.635
David, hi. Wow, what are you
doing here?

09:12.718 --> 09:15.096
{\an1}Uh, just, uh, taking a break
from the job hunt.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.138
Looking through
the classifieds.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.682
Yeah.<i> Hollywood Vine.</i>

09:17.765 --> 09:18.849
Can't believe I'm here.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.518
{\an1}Yeah, it's a place
like any other.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.519
Right.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.521
{\an1}Well, I see you're getting
the hang of this, huh?

09:23.604 --> 09:24.313
Yeah.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.107
Hey, hey.
Nice.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.650
{\an1}My friend is sleeping
on the couch

09:27.733 --> 09:29.652
{\an1}because he thinks you can't
afford a hotel room.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.737
I offered up the bed.

09:33.072 --> 09:33.823
What are you doing out here?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.032
{\an3}I just had a break
from classes.

09:35.116 --> 09:35.574
{\an3}I thought, I'd,
you know...

09:35.658 --> 09:37.702
I mean, here in L.A.?

09:37.785 --> 09:39.370
I want to be famous.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.496
Really? Do you

09:40.579 --> 09:42.999
act, sing, dance,

09:43.082 --> 09:44.667
write, produce, direct?

09:44.750 --> 09:47.586
Well, not exactly.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.714
So what exactly are you planning
on being famous for?

09:49.797 --> 09:52.466
Being me.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.510
Being you.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.512
So will you show me?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.055
Show you what?

09:58.139 --> 09:59.807
Everything.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.523
Carl loves golf.

10:07.606 --> 10:08.899
He plays every Saturday.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.736
{\an3}Free greens at
Green Hills Park.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.738
{\an3}Little perk for
the boys in blue.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.197
You're a cop?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.324
{\an3}17 years.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.199
A detective?

10:17.283 --> 10:17.867
No, uniform.

10:17.950 --> 10:18.701
Passed over.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.785
That's too bad.

10:20.786 --> 10:21.871
Listen, Mom,

10:21.954 --> 10:23.706
I really needed to talk to you.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.498
It's about Dad.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.543
Oh, man, losing
your dad at 17.

10:27.626 --> 10:28.669
And so suddenly, too.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.838
I mean, those roads up
by the lake,

10:30.921 --> 10:32.548
they just ice right over.

10:32.631 --> 10:33.716
Carl...

10:33.799 --> 10:34.383
What are you talking about?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.384
Well, your dad's car accident.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.886
{\an3}Carl,

10:36.969 --> 10:38.929
{\an1}would you see
about our table, please?

10:39.013 --> 10:40.973
{\an3}Yeah.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.356
{\an1}Wait. You lied to Carl
about Dad?

10:48.439 --> 10:51.400
{\an3}"Your husband killed
himself. Why?"

10:52.818 --> 10:54.445
That's never a question,
that's an accusation.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.863
No one's accusing you.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.616
I couldn't make him happy.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.868
I couldn't keep him.
I couldn't stop him.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.412
His death--
Mom, it's not your fault.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.748
So now I say he died
in a car accident.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.833
Secrets don't keep, but lying...

11:07.917 --> 11:10.252
It's done. It's over.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.797
There's too much at stake
to go back now.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.423
I want to go back.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.591
Please.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.385
We're getting married.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.636
You're engaged?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.389
(sighs)
Again?

11:21.472 --> 11:22.431
Don't you bring that up, either.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.309
I want this.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.061
I can't believe it.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.271
A man his age...

11:29.355 --> 11:30.564
But he wants me, too.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.237
This is my chance.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.613
Don't screw it up.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.617
Sorry, ladies.
We're up.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.120
{\an3}Don't want to
lose the table.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.496
What, did you flash your badge
or something?

11:45.579 --> 11:46.831
{\an3}(chuckles)

11:46.914 --> 11:48.082
Never out of uniform.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.959
Carl would never
abuse his authority.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.502
Well, that's a departure
from type.

11:52.586 --> 11:53.963
{\an1}VALERIE:
So, Carl...

11:54.046 --> 11:55.381
(clears throat)
...tell me something.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.590
You ever kill anybody?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.008
Oh, Valerie.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.388
She's kidding.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.355
(speaking Spanish)

12:16.569 --> 12:19.321
{\an3}Welcome to the exclusive
Hotel Montreux.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.823
Strip.

12:21.782 --> 12:22.825
Do it!

12:22.908 --> 12:24.452
(conversing indistinctly)

12:24.535 --> 12:25.578
(hesitant grunt)

12:27.580 --> 12:29.540
Oh!

12:30.458 --> 12:32.751
(giggling)

12:39.925 --> 12:41.343
Honey, do you have the key?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.345
{\an1}No, I thought
you had the key.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.182
No. I don't have it.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.392
Excuse me, miss?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.102
Um, we left our key
in the room.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.979
Would you mind
opening the gate for us?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.147
Thanks.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.232
{\an1}Thank you.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.320
Thank you so much.

12:59.403 --> 13:02.406
Thank you very much.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.201
Can't swim, can you?

13:05.284 --> 13:08.537
{\an1}(giggling)

13:08.621 --> 13:10.331
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.625
{\an1}(laughs)

13:19.423 --> 13:20.424
{\an3}(grunts)

13:21.467 --> 13:23.344
Wow.

13:23.427 --> 13:27.890
There must be some big movie
premiere going on or something.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.730
You getting in?

13:36.440 --> 13:38.234
It's just so great.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.402
I'm already trying
to remember it.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.535
DANIEL:
If we can fight the IRS liens,

13:47.618 --> 13:49.912
and then pull out of
the Saudi drilling, I think...

13:49.995 --> 13:51.914
{\an3}(knocking)
Excuse me.

13:51.997 --> 13:52.957
Dad, you got a sec?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.416
Clearly, this isn't
a good time.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.043
I talked to your assistant.
He told me...

13:56.126 --> 13:57.419
He's out of a job.
And so am I

13:57.503 --> 13:58.546
if we can't wade through this.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.256
It'll take five minutes.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.424
(sighs)

14:07.388 --> 14:09.890
Okay. What's it about?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.308
It's about family.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.434
{\an3}Look, I know I'm showing up
late in the game here,

14:12.518 --> 14:13.435
but I want to help.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.603
What do you want to do?

14:14.687 --> 14:15.771
I don't know.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.273
{\an3}I mean, we could
talk about it.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.441
{\an3}You tell me what
to do, I'll do it.

14:19.525 --> 14:23.112
{\an1}I told you years ago.
You start in the mailroom,

14:23.195 --> 14:24.905
you do the executive training
program, you learn the ropes.

14:24.989 --> 14:28.325
{\an1}Then you be the son who could
watch your father's back,

14:28.409 --> 14:30.911
so my guts aren't chumming
the water for sharks like these.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.462
They're just notes.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.173
You got the part about
the ectopic pregnancy.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.675
It's a leading killer of...

14:44.758 --> 14:46.802
{\an3}Of women and a direct
result of untreated STDs.

14:46.885 --> 14:49.972
Yeah, I got it.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.142
{\an1}These patients-- I know
their stories, but...

14:53.225 --> 14:56.812
The way you write about
them makes me realize...

14:56.895 --> 14:59.106
How important you are.

14:59.189 --> 15:04.486
How lost they'll be
without the clinic.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.198
You'll be okay, Kel.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.199
You can do anything.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.202
{\an3}Any place, anybody would
be lucky to have you.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.954
{\an1}(groans)
Don't do that, Brandon.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.164
{\an3}Don't...

15:15.247 --> 15:17.374
Flatter you?
I'm not. It's the truth.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.667
Okay, stop.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.502
Don't be kind and helpful.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.962
Us working together,

15:22.046 --> 15:24.298
fighting for the same cause,

15:24.381 --> 15:26.508
finishing each other's
sentences, it's just too...

15:26.592 --> 15:28.177
Easy. I know.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.470
You just did it again.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.139
(sighs)

15:32.222 --> 15:34.892
I knew we shouldn't
have done this.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.185
I knew this was going to happen.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.478
This... wh...

15:37.561 --> 15:38.520
This, what?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.730
This.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.722
Good morning.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.932
{\an1}Morning.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.725
{\an1}(grunts)

16:16.809 --> 16:18.352
{\an3}Nice quilt.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.771
Oh, yeah.
(grunts)

16:20.854 --> 16:22.940
Where'd you get it?

16:23.023 --> 16:25.943
{\an1}This beautiful girl
brought it to me last night.

16:26.026 --> 16:29.029
Whispered something in my ear.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.073
She smelled like cinnamon.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.283
{\an3}Mmm. Sounds
like a dream.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.327
What happened
to the girl?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.246
Don't know.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.331
{\an1}We were supposed
to hook up.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.546
{\an3}I thought "See you at home"
meant "See you later."

16:46.630 --> 16:48.048
Really?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.385
{\an3}Steve.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.929
I would never stand you up.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.056
I was on campus all day and
then I was pounding the pavement

16:56.140 --> 16:57.391
{\an3}looking for a
waitressing job.

16:57.474 --> 17:01.061
{\an1}Spending money you don't
have on gifts for me.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.231
Best part of my day.

17:04.314 --> 17:07.943
You know, Sophie, maybe
I wasn't clear about last night.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.613
I want to see you.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.656
I want us to go out.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.450
So we'll go.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.617
{\an1}(chuckles)

17:15.701 --> 17:17.118
{\an1}On a date.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.079
(sighs)

17:20.164 --> 17:22.415
Steve...

17:22.499 --> 17:24.251
I can't.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.130
See...
(sighs)

17:28.213 --> 17:30.299
{\an3}back in Boston,
there's this guy.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.300
A guy.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.676
Yeah.
Mm.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.262
I mean, he's an ex-boyfriend.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.181
{\an1}Huh.
But...

17:37.264 --> 17:40.309
we just broke up, and...

17:40.392 --> 17:42.311
I'm still wrecked, you know?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.480
You seem fine.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.482
It's not easy.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.318
I know. It's not.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.863
{\an1}How did you
get home last night?

17:52.946 --> 17:54.156
{\an3}You don't have to
worry about me.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.282
{\an1}Well, I...

17:55.365 --> 17:58.160
{\an1}I know you don't have a car,
and I-I heard one pull up.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.454
A friend from school.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.498
You make friends fast.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.292
{\an3}(groaning)

18:05.375 --> 18:08.712
{\an3}Excuse me.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.798
(knocking at door)

18:12.591 --> 18:13.801
Hi.
Hi.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.052
I was going to call you.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.303
{\an1}I've been waiting
at the paper.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.472
{\an1}We've still got two more
interviews to do.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.307
{\an3}Yeah, I know. I know.
I'll talk to them.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.560
Listen, about last night.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.145
We kissed.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.356
Yeah.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.024
{\an3}If you say it didn't
mean anything,

18:29.107 --> 18:29.983
I might have to kick you.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.527
{\an1}I'm not exactly sure
how to proceed here, Kel.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.653
This is new to me.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.905
Here's the plan.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.698
{\an3}You don't have to
do the article.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.492
I want to do the article.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.369
I stopped by the <i> LA Chronicle.</i>

18:40.452 --> 18:42.663
I talked to a reporter
there, John Wakefield.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.206
{\an3}I told him
about the clinic,

18:44.289 --> 18:46.750
{\an3}and I said that you would
give him your notes.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.419
You asked for my help.

18:49.503 --> 18:53.048
The <i> Chronicle</i> has a
larger circulation.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.383
{\an1}That's not
why you're doing this.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.677
I want him to do
the story, okay?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.514
What's this?

19:00.597 --> 19:02.349
{\an3}His number.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.934
Give him a call.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.189
(door slamming)

19:14.319 --> 19:16.321
{\an3}KELLY:
Hey, Sophie.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.865
Hi.
Steve coming?

19:17.948 --> 19:19.366
No. He's down at the <i> Beat,</i>

19:19.449 --> 19:20.909
fleecing advertisers
for free merchandise.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.119
No school today?

19:22.202 --> 19:23.245
{\an1}(laughs)

19:23.328 --> 19:26.290
{\an1}You know, in grad school,
they let you leave the campus.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.791
(chuckles)
Get out of here.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.042
Hey. Are all these yours?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.252
Nope.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.628
I hit up every designer I know.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.713
I'm behind on production

19:32.796 --> 19:34.590
because I put two seamstresses
on a bridal order.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.716
You sold a gown?

19:35.799 --> 19:37.467
Yep. All thanks to you.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.261
You know,
it's such a high profile item.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.096
Would you be
into auctioning one?

19:41.179 --> 19:42.806
I only have that one sample.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.058
Right. The one at Rudman's.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.268
The one that made me cry.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.269
That's the one.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.812
Do you think they'd be willing
to loan it out?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.439
You really want someone
bidding on your gown?

19:50.522 --> 19:52.441
If it benefits the clinic, sure.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.277
Okay,
but you're beyond selfless.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.445
Hardly.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.908
Once upon a time, I had Brandon
and a job I cared about.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.285
Now, get me the dress.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.456
About yesterday...

20:07.539 --> 20:08.916
I had a blast.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.250
{\an1}(chuckles)

20:10.334 --> 20:11.460
I like this town.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.961
Yeah, like a fish to water.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.296
{\an3}(chuckles)

20:14.379 --> 20:15.172
(sighs)

20:15.255 --> 20:17.299
{\an1}You didn't, by chance,
happen to tell Steve

20:17.382 --> 20:18.467
about our date, did you?

20:18.550 --> 20:19.801
No. I haven't seen him.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.137
See, he has a bit
of a crush on me.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.430
It's no big deal.

20:23.513 --> 20:27.142
Even less of a big deal if, say,
we didn't hang out yesterday.

20:27.225 --> 20:28.810
(chuckles)

20:28.894 --> 20:30.187
Sophie, he's a friend.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.271
Okay? I'm not going
to lie to him.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.649
There's no point.
There's nothing going on here.

20:35.025 --> 20:35.859
Okay?

20:38.528 --> 20:40.906
{\an1}Ah, you're busy,
I can see.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.493
Nothing I can't handle.
How have you been, Mr. Hunter?

20:44.576 --> 20:46.495
A fool, thank you for asking.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.456
You caught me off-guard
yesterday.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.542
Dad wasn't really
in the mood to talk.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.504
I didn't know how to tell you.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.547
Family trait.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.133
He's here now.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.809
What are you, uh, setting up?

21:08.892 --> 21:11.019
Uh, it's a little fundraiser.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.522
Oh, that's what you meant
by help.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.315
(laughs)

21:15.399 --> 21:17.776
Hey.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.529
Let's go for a drive.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.697
(chuckles)

21:21.780 --> 21:23.740
All right.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.208
Janet, when a girl says she
wants to be just friends...

21:33.291 --> 21:34.876
{\an3}It means she's never
going to sleep with you.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.003
{\an1}Mm. Um...

21:36.086 --> 21:39.214
{\an1}What about if she says she
just broke up with somebody?

21:39.298 --> 21:41.550
It's a variation on a theme.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.843
(knocking)

21:42.926 --> 21:45.387
Hi. I'm John Wakefield.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.389
I'm looking for Brandon Walsh.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.057
(clears throat)

21:49.141 --> 21:51.518
Steve Sanders, Janet Sosna,
this is John Wakefield.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.769
He works for the <i> Chronicle.</i>

21:52.853 --> 21:54.271
Hi.
Hi.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.647
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.357
Good little paper
you guys got here.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.442
{\an3}Thank you.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.610
Kelly said you had some info
on that clinic closing.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.029
Right over here.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.238
{\an1}I've got transcripts
of interviews,

22:03.321 --> 22:06.408
{\an1}but the angle I'd use
is the Wyatt Foundation.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.369
Beverly Hills beauty
abandons Rodeo Drive

22:09.453 --> 22:10.871
for an inner city clinic.

22:10.954 --> 22:11.997
Got to love that, huh?

22:12.080 --> 22:16.251
She's trying to drum up
donations, not run for office.

22:16.334 --> 22:19.588
Hey, uh, what's
her deal anyway?

22:19.671 --> 22:21.298
Take the notes, read them over.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.467
You got any questions,
give me a call.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.260
It writes itself really,
Brandon.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.262
These places go belly-up
all the time.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.430
Well, that's an angle.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.556
It's been done.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.558
It's worth a couple of lines.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.271
{\an3}Hey, maybe there is
something in it.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.814
Other than trying to get a date?

22:37.898 --> 22:41.443
I'll tell you what, why don't
you hang on to these.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.322
I think I've got the story.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.294
Your mother
will rise to this.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.421
She was born with
some advantages.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.382
{\an3}Advantages? My father
was a locksmith.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.134
She marries well.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.595
It's a skill. It is.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.305
{\an3}For richer,
for poorer, right?

23:10.388 --> 23:12.099
Ever play any ball?

23:12.182 --> 23:14.810
{\an3}Yeah, varsity
in high school.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.938
Yes, of course.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.815
I remember when I
was a little kid,

23:19.898 --> 23:22.818
and you got me this ball
signed by Reggie Jackson.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.486
And Josh got Pete Rose.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.656
{\an1}And you kept after me
morning and night.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.992
{\an1}Finally I took you
out to the park.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.828
Taught me how to throw.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.621
Yeah. We stayed until dark.

23:34.704 --> 23:38.333
You were about,
oh, that tall.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.795
{\an1}No jacket, shivering
like crazy.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.965
{\an1}Hands so cold, you
couldn't even grip the ball.

23:45.048 --> 23:48.176
{\an3}You promised
we'd come back.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.471
{\an3}Better late
than never, right?

23:51.555 --> 23:54.432
Yeah.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.314
Hey.

24:01.398 --> 24:06.403
Yesterday-- it's not that
I'm disappointed in you.

24:06.486 --> 24:09.030
It's just that you're
not proud, right?

24:09.114 --> 24:11.533
You're a kid still.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.493
You don't know,
you can't understand.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.704
Hey... any place
you've got to be?

24:17.998 --> 24:19.374
(chuckles)

24:19.457 --> 24:21.334
No.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.893
(knock on door)

24:39.644 --> 24:41.438
I need to talk to you.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.440
Carl, can you
please leave?

24:45.108 --> 24:46.902
Honey, I don't mind.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.362
You two girls catch up.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.414
When I was a kid and Dad
would come into my room,

24:59.497 --> 25:00.749
there was nothing I could do.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.292
You can stop this right now.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.878
Put this behind you, Valerie.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.421
I'm trying.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.424
You have no idea how hard.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.427
But he was stronger.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.429
And he blackmailed me.

25:14.512 --> 25:18.475
{\an1}He said he would tell you,
and you would get mad.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.310
So crazy that threat,

25:20.393 --> 25:24.606
because that's all I ever wanted
to do was tell you.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.107
And it worked.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.068
I don't want to hear this.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.819
When I got older,
I fought him off.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.655
Why are you doing this?!

25:31.738 --> 25:33.198
I didn't do anything!

25:34.699 --> 25:38.495
No, I did. I did finally.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.915
Threatening him.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.209
Saying you were going
to the police.

25:45.543 --> 25:48.129
Next thing I know, he's lying
in a puddle of blood--

25:48.213 --> 25:50.131
his face, head...

25:50.215 --> 25:52.509
Wait, the police?

25:53.593 --> 25:55.470
How did you know I said that?

25:56.763 --> 25:58.473
He told you?

25:58.556 --> 26:00.141
He was getting help.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.434
You knew?

26:03.603 --> 26:06.481
Do you have any idea
how hard it was for me

26:06.564 --> 26:07.774
to tell you the truth?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.319
You seemed so shocked.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.570
But you already knew.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.239
Yes.

26:14.322 --> 26:19.369
I had the sickening job
of asking my husband...

26:20.704 --> 26:22.789
...if he was having sex
with our daughter.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.458
Is that what you wanted to hear?

26:25.542 --> 26:27.085
No.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.963
Dad was raping me.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.214
{\an3}If he admitted
it to you,

26:31.298 --> 26:34.592
why didn't you do anything
to stop it?

26:34.676 --> 26:37.137
He was getting help.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.390
We were going
to be happy again--

26:40.473 --> 26:43.310
the three of us.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.563
So why did he kill himself?

26:58.116 --> 26:59.868
DAVID:
<i>We've got trips, evenings out.</i>

26:59.951 --> 27:01.578
<i>Stuff you need</i>
<i>and stuff you just want.</i>

27:01.661 --> 27:03.163
And we'll go over the items,

27:03.246 --> 27:04.831
but the first section--
silent bids only, okay?

27:04.914 --> 27:07.500
You'll get a chance to call it
out after the fashion show.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.502
And here we go.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.505
Item number one
from Galaway Travel

27:12.589 --> 27:15.342
is a six-day, seven-night stay
in New York, New York.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.718
Just like you pictured it,

27:16.801 --> 27:17.844
with tickets to a Beck show.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.972
Okay, why don't you try
the cut velvet and then the red.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.599
Where's the underslip thing?

27:22.682 --> 27:24.225
{\an1}Oh, here.
I pressed it.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.560
Oh, great. Thanks.

27:25.643 --> 27:27.062
Kel, Val's a no-show.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.563
Oh, her mom's in town.

27:28.646 --> 27:29.898
{\an3}For once, I feel
sorry for her.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.358
Who gets the finale?

27:31.441 --> 27:34.611
Um, I just thought
we would display it.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.863
I didn't want to tailor it
to someone else.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.406
I knew you probably wouldn't
want to wear it, so...

27:38.490 --> 27:39.407
I bet it'd fit me.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.910
{\an1}Uh, there's no takers
on your bet.

27:43.536 --> 27:47.582
{\an5}DAVID:
The next item we've got--
number two

27:47.665 --> 27:51.127
is a one-year pass to the movies
courtesy of Big Movie Theatres.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.755
{\an5}DAVID:
You and a guest can see
every flick in town

27:53.838 --> 27:54.923
and only pay
for the popcorn.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.716
Now, this may be a silent
auction, but I want to hear...

27:56.800 --> 27:59.552
It's that Wakefield guy.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.637
The one who's after Kelly?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.264
Thanks for reminding me.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.100
{\an5}DAVID:
Action, drama, comedy,
you'll be seeing it all

28:05.183 --> 28:07.102
while your friends are forking
out eight bucks a pop.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.561
{\an6}WOMAN:
Do you have another
pair of stockings?

28:08.645 --> 28:10.438
{\an6}DONNA:
Yeah, I do,
right here.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.982
{\an1}Hey, your guy from
the <i> Chronicle's</i> here.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.567
{\an3}My guy? He's covering
the story.

28:14.651 --> 28:15.610
Right, Kel.

28:15.693 --> 28:16.778
He wants a date.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.405
Will you just give him
your notes?

28:18.488 --> 28:20.240
You'll be lucky if you get
a mention in his paper.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.158
Are you going to do it or not?

28:22.242 --> 28:23.201
No.

28:26.704 --> 28:29.082
{\an6}(huffing)
DAVID:
CD's, records, tapes...

28:29.165 --> 28:31.209
{\an3}DONNA: How's that?
WOMAN: That's great.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.296
{\an3}Hey, um, when I said I
wanted to wear the dress,

28:35.380 --> 28:37.799
{\an3}I guess my timing was
really bad, huh?

28:37.882 --> 28:38.883
No, it shouldn't matter.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.135
Not anymore.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.803
You guys were
going to get married?

28:41.886 --> 28:43.513
Yeah.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.806
{\an3}DAVID:
Rock, rap, pop, country...

28:44.889 --> 28:47.016
Show him what he's missing.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.894
{\an5}DAVID:
Take it all while you're
swinging up and down the aisles.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.649
{\an1}DAVID: An original designer
in a designer original.

28:54.732 --> 28:57.152
{\an1}That's Donna Martin, folks,
in a black jacket

28:57.235 --> 29:00.447
{\an1}with ostrich trim over
a fabulous leopard dress.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.120
{\an1}Up next, another
Donna Martin original.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.955
{\an1}Flappers invade
Beverly Hills

29:09.038 --> 29:11.166
{\an1}with this red velvet
top and black tasseled skirt.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.295
Pretty girl.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.010
Total innocent.

29:22.093 --> 29:25.346
{\an3}Naive, maybe, but,
yeah, she is pretty.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.639
You think so?

29:26.723 --> 29:28.016
She's been asking about you.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.309
Really?

29:29.392 --> 29:32.061
{\an1}Well, yeah, mostly when
she first got here.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.481
See much of her?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.024
Regular amounts.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.692
You know, she's around.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.532
{\an1}Hey, you know what,
the night before last,

29:44.616 --> 29:46.034
she was out kind of late.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.494
Somebody gave her a ride home.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.912
{\an1}I was wondering maybe
if that was you.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.501
No, it wasn't me.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.837
{\an3}Valerie.

29:57.921 --> 30:01.591
{\an3}Your mom said you were
working on a fundraiser here.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.803
Well, I wanted
to talk to you.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.805
Obviously.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.517
You want to go inside,
get something to eat?

30:10.600 --> 30:11.851
No, not really.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.270
You like to sit?

30:14.354 --> 30:15.522
No.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.774
No. Well, your mom's upset.

30:17.857 --> 30:22.946
She wouldn't say why, but I'm
guessing you don't like me.

30:23.029 --> 30:25.740
You're not even a speck
in my universe.

30:25.823 --> 30:29.410
Is this a problem with cops,
is that what this is?

30:29.494 --> 30:30.912
Ask my mother.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.456
{\an3}You asked me if I
ever killed anybody.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.542
I did.

30:36.834 --> 30:38.253
And it's not like
cops and robbers.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.879
It's not a little hole
in the chest

30:39.963 --> 30:41.130
and a spot of blood
like you think.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.591
No, it's a thousand times worse.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.219
Robert Mendoza.

30:46.302 --> 30:49.264
It's funny how you remember
kids you went to school with

30:49.347 --> 30:50.765
by their first and last names.

30:50.848 --> 30:52.767
What, was he a friend of yours?

30:52.850 --> 30:53.810
From the neighborhood.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.938
He went one way,
I went the other.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.649
I got a call on a break-in.

30:59.732 --> 31:01.859
I searched the premises.

31:01.943 --> 31:06.114
All of a sudden , I feel a
forearm collapsing my windpipe.

31:06.197 --> 31:09.659
There's a gun-- his.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.286
You shot him with his own gun?

31:11.369 --> 31:13.121
Did he aim it at you?

31:13.204 --> 31:14.247
He jumped me.

31:14.330 --> 31:16.124
Trying to get away.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.625
Maybe he wasn't gonna use it.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.961
You want me
to feel guilty about it?

31:20.044 --> 31:21.254
How do you not?

31:21.337 --> 31:24.632
Doing wrong,
that was his choice.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.219
His gun, his mistake.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.519
Item number ten, note it well.

31:36.603 --> 31:40.315
Slip into it and slip past
any velvet rope in town.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.816
{\an1}Nice work.

31:41.899 --> 31:43.359
{\an3}(feedback squeal)
Thanks.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.444
Good song list.

31:44.527 --> 31:45.778
{\an1}Some choices
I haven't heard before.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.947
{\an1}Uh, are you
working other clubs, too?

31:48.031 --> 31:50.158
Mm-mm. No, I'm just helping out
a friend.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.452
Oh. I get dragged
to these fundraisers.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.703
Usually, I'm dozing by now.

31:53.786 --> 31:56.039
{\an1}Rick Miller,
KBIB.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.999
Right, L.A. Canyon College.
That's a good station.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.459
{\an1}Yeah.
I'm David Silver.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.337
We're looking for new voices,
new venues.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.504
You give me a call.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.840
I will. Thanks.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.888
Wrapping our fashion segment
with a custom-designed

32:11.971 --> 32:14.474
Donna Martin wedding gown.

32:14.557 --> 32:16.684
Live bids only, please.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.578
We're starting
with a bid of $400.

32:39.707 --> 32:41.292
$500.

32:41.376 --> 32:42.710
$500 for the gown.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.544
Not for the dress.

32:44.837 --> 32:45.838
$500 is for dinner
with the model.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.590
(audience oohing)

32:48.966 --> 32:52.345
Uh, well, we gotta be fair.

32:52.428 --> 32:55.723
Put it out to the floor.
Do I hear $550?

32:55.807 --> 32:56.891
$600.

32:56.974 --> 32:59.560
{\an1}WOMAN:
Oh, my goodness.

32:59.644 --> 33:00.853
$650.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.730
A thousand dollars!

33:02.814 --> 33:05.024
(audience gasps and murmurs)

33:09.153 --> 33:11.072
{\an3}I'm sensing a fight
to the death.

33:11.155 --> 33:12.782
DAVID:
Okay. It's a thousand dollars

33:12.865 --> 33:14.242
going once...

33:15.827 --> 33:17.453
...going twice...

33:17.537 --> 33:18.705
Gone.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.790
DAVID: A thousand dollars.
(man whoops)

33:20.873 --> 33:22.500
(applause)

33:35.388 --> 33:37.890
Dad, let's get out of here.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.308
It's getting late.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.935
Three olives.

33:41.018 --> 33:42.770
{\an3}Anything less
is a crime.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.773
Tell that to the IRS.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.734
{\an4}Running low.
Let's go
somewhere else

33:47.817 --> 33:49.235
for a drink-- come on.

33:49.318 --> 33:51.904
Frankly, I'm... swamped.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.906
Look, will you walk away?

33:53.990 --> 33:54.741
It's over.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.784
And this is not
what life's about.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.120
(chuckles):
Kids today.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.581
No respect for capitalism.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.749
Look, I'm trying here.

34:02.832 --> 34:03.624
I thought we were
getting somewhere.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.585
I mean, the other day
at the park...

34:05.668 --> 34:07.295
{\an1}Was for you.
For me.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.920
Oh, so it meant nothing to you.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.757
Don't pull it apart; just
take it with you and go home.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.092
Look, I listed the boat today.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.594
With a second mortgage
on the club,

34:15.678 --> 34:17.096
I can get you
$400,000 or $500,000.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.639
I'm sure your mother
will appreciate it.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.639
Again, nothing!

34:19.724 --> 34:20.850
I reach out to you,

34:20.933 --> 34:22.810
{\an1}you reach for
the stinking martinis!

34:22.893 --> 34:26.147
Oh, and that was the one thing
I had left to look forward to.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.024
{\an5}(scoffs):
You have nobody
to blame but yourself.

34:28.107 --> 34:31.152
Words to remember.

34:45.373 --> 34:47.376
(gunshot booms)

35:06.437 --> 35:09.023
David, she knew
about the abuse.

35:09.106 --> 35:11.692
I mean, she said that
they talked about it.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.820
I could just imagine them
in the kitchen.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.238
"What do we do about Valerie?"

35:15.321 --> 35:18.282
You don't seem surprised.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.285
Even if you don't know,

35:21.369 --> 35:24.080
{\an3}on some level,
you do, you have to.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.915
Maybe for her

35:25.998 --> 35:27.708
just facing it...

35:27.792 --> 35:29.126
Divorce.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.378
Shame, guilt.

35:30.461 --> 35:33.256
It's better than hearing your
daughter cry in her bedroom.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.216
Don't look to her--
you need to help yourself.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.217
And what do
you suggest?

35:36.300 --> 35:37.718
Prozac?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.053
Art therapy?

35:39.136 --> 35:40.221
A lobotomy?

35:40.304 --> 35:41.556
{\an1}I killed
my father, David.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.933
{\an1}I'm trying to help you here.
But you can't.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.977
You told me that-- go talk
to somebody, but not you.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.312
{\an3}I don't know what
to do for you, okay?

35:48.396 --> 35:50.064
I can't begin to understand
what you've been through.

35:50.147 --> 35:52.817
Well, maybe I've found
somebody who does.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.735
(wry chuckle)

35:54.819 --> 35:56.737
{\an1}A professional, I hope.
He was when

35:56.821 --> 35:58.406
he was on the job,
so yeah, a professional.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.574
He can understand.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.909
More than you.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.078
What do you want me to say here?

36:04.161 --> 36:06.080
"You're fixed, congratulations"?

36:06.163 --> 36:07.999
No, just thank me.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.251
(scoffs):
You're off the hook.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.047
(sighs)

36:15.131 --> 36:16.966
{\an5}AUDREY:
<i>Well, the article</i>
<i>in the</i> Chronicle

36:17.049 --> 36:19.427
{\an3}was embarrassing to the
board of directors.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.138
The poor and the sick--
so passé.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.726
{\an1}The foundation paid
for this clinic.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.102
We haven't forgotten that.

36:28.185 --> 36:29.562
{\an3}Oh, they'll continue
their support.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.981
You didn't leave them
much choice, did you?

36:32.064 --> 36:35.151
{\an3}Go ahead and
smile; you won.

36:35.234 --> 36:38.321
But you still have to take
your staff down by 20%.

36:38.404 --> 36:39.780
We need everybody.

36:39.864 --> 36:43.326
Well, pick your battles--
starting <i> now.</i>

36:43.409 --> 36:45.953
(sighs)

36:46.037 --> 36:48.414
You want staff cuts,
start with me.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.916
Oh, Kelly.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.335
That's not gonna solve
the clinic's problems.

36:52.418 --> 36:54.754
You said yourself
it's a never-ending battle.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.964
{\an6}I want to keep fighting,
but...
It's hard

36:57.048 --> 36:59.133
being a patron saint
to losing battles.

36:59.216 --> 37:02.470
I just think it's time
for a new job description.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.930
Oh, what are you gonna do?

37:04.013 --> 37:05.264
I don't know.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.390
Miss it.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.267
I think we did good here.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.186
Don't kid yourself--

37:10.269 --> 37:12.104
you did great.

37:17.526 --> 37:19.195
How was your day, dear?

37:21.906 --> 37:22.823
I got a job.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.325
That's great.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.618
{\an3}Sort of.

37:25.701 --> 37:28.162
It's a, uh...
it's a tryout

37:28.245 --> 37:30.039
for KVIB.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.668
How about you?

37:33.751 --> 37:35.294
{\an3}Are you...
famous yet?

37:35.378 --> 37:36.504
No.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.132
(laughs quietly)

37:41.717 --> 37:43.636
{\an1}Carrying the angst
of a nation--

37:43.719 --> 37:45.262
how do you bear it?

37:47.139 --> 37:49.350
I lied to Steve about us.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.019
I thought you said
you wouldn't have to lie,

37:52.103 --> 37:54.021
because there's nothing
going on with us.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.482
{\an1}Look, you get this job
out of nowhere.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.110
Sometimes that's
just the way things happen.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.736
It's not something

38:00.820 --> 38:03.739
you're looking for,
something you think you want...

38:05.116 --> 38:07.034
...and it turns out great.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.079
Well, I-I haven't done it yet.

38:10.162 --> 38:11.372
You will.

38:33.394 --> 38:36.564
{\an3}You know, I read the
article in the <i> Chronicle.</i>

38:36.647 --> 38:38.566
Your article.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.944
{\an3}I had read some of your notes
in the draft that you did.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.946
{\an3}You just handed the
whole thing to Wakefield.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.991
{\an1}I convinced him there was a
story by giving him the story.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.993
{\an1}PR people do it
all the time.

38:49.076 --> 38:52.580
{\an3}But you did this for me--
no byline, no pay.

38:52.663 --> 38:56.250
Well, I <i> was</i> hoping for
a little... kickback.

38:56.333 --> 38:59.587
Well, that's it, that's the
kickback I was looking for.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.090
{\an1}Hey, what do you say we go
to that Italian place you like

39:03.174 --> 39:04.759
and get some dessert, huh?

39:04.842 --> 39:06.052
{\an3}I can't.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.178
{\an3}We can't.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.222
Thank you for this day, but...

39:10.306 --> 39:12.933
{\an1}You shouldn't have.
You really shouldn't have.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.063
Look, a-about the bidding war...

39:17.146 --> 39:18.773
I got jealous.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.442
{\an3}And that's why you didn't want
Wakefield to have the story.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.319
And after, I felt like a heel,

39:23.402 --> 39:25.696
{\an1}so I loaded up
and handed it off.

39:26.864 --> 39:27.907
I don't know,

39:27.990 --> 39:29.492
the thought of you
with another guy...

39:29.575 --> 39:32.787
You really think
I'd move on that fast?

39:32.870 --> 39:33.829
{\an1}Someday.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.998
And you'll look beautiful
in your wedding gown,

39:36.082 --> 39:38.584
and you'll walk down
the aisle to some...

39:38.667 --> 39:40.586
lucky guy standing at the altar.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.799
And I hate it...

39:44.882 --> 39:47.134
but it won't be me.

39:56.268 --> 39:58.229
Thank you for our last date.

40:01.398 --> 40:03.567
All right, come on,
I'll walk you home.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.152
You know what?

40:05.236 --> 40:07.154
My place isn't
far from here.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.073
I'll be fine on my own.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.169
(knocking)

40:24.422 --> 40:25.673
(exhales)

40:26.632 --> 40:30.553
So... what's this
about you leaving?

40:30.636 --> 40:34.181
I didn't want to upset you.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.475
I know you think I'm a coward.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.022
I used to dress up
in your clothes,

40:42.106 --> 40:43.399
wear your perfume,

40:43.482 --> 40:46.360
play grown-up.

40:46.443 --> 40:48.529
I didn't like being a kid.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.739
You didn't get
to be one for long.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.200
That stuff with Dad...

40:53.284 --> 40:54.869
I felt powerless.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.663
And powerful.

40:57.746 --> 40:59.081
It's a strange combination.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.542
When I suspected,
I did confront him.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.878
At first he lied,

41:03.961 --> 41:07.047
and then he said he'd get help.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.049
What could I do?

41:09.133 --> 41:11.051
He was your father.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.220
Mom, don't, okay?

41:13.304 --> 41:14.930
(sighs)

41:15.014 --> 41:16.223
I understand.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.058
You couldn't.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.894
I'm trying.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.770
But we need time.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.063
Of course.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.940
{\an1}Well, you let me know.
No,

41:25.024 --> 41:26.942
no-- time together.

41:27.026 --> 41:28.402
{\an1}(sighs)

41:28.485 --> 41:30.487
I know Dad was
the enemy, not you.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.865
Please, I'm asking you.

41:32.948 --> 41:35.910
Just stay in town
for a couple more days.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.912
I know it would really help.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.289
(knocking)

41:49.006 --> 41:51.425
{\an3}Uh, ma'am, your bags?
Oh. The bags.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.387
We're not checking out
after all.

42:09.151 --> 42:12.196
I thought you might be here.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.949
Everyone's looking for you.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.451
Not everyone.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.039
Not my father.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.752
{\an3}Who told you?
His lawyer called.

42:26.835 --> 42:28.379
He's gonna be making the
arrangements for your mother.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.840
I'm sorry.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.052
(sighs)

42:37.221 --> 42:39.306
(exhales, sniffles)

42:39.390 --> 42:42.142
You think the police will
miss this from the crime scene?

42:48.315 --> 42:49.650
Suicide.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.860
It is a crime, isn't it?

42:51.944 --> 42:53.362
I don't know why--

42:53.445 --> 42:55.155
the only person you hurt
is yourself.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.490
You know that's not true.

42:56.573 --> 42:59.159
You know how to make
a perfect martini?

42:59.243 --> 43:01.328
Let me tell you.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.748
You put... you put three...
three olives in it.

43:05.916 --> 43:08.002
My father taught me that.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.504
(sighs)

43:21.765 --> 43:23.809
DONNA:
Signed by Reggie Jackson.

43:23.892 --> 43:26.312
I wanted this my whole life.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.742
Too late now.
