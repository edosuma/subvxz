machine on this list.

gonna go down, Craig.

09:14.050 --> 09:15.590
Just tell us where Alex Marshall
is and I can stop hurting you.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.510
I thought she was the one
asking the questions.

09:23.060 --> 09:23.940
[punch]

09:25.190 --> 09:27.310
I don't know where Alex is.
I swear I don't.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.150
I hear you and Alex are quite
the lady's men.

09:34.190 --> 09:35.490
[sparks]

09:37.950 --> 09:41.370
- We do alright, I guess.
- Hmm.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.750
What are you doing?

09:42.790 --> 09:43.790
[sparks]

09:43.830 --> 09:44.870
What are you-

09:44.910 --> 09:46.870
I wonder how well you'd do-

09:46.920 --> 09:47.920
without those.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.210
[Alex]
Okay!

09:49.340 --> 09:51.710
I heard the cops say
that he's dead.

09:52.630 --> 09:53.760
Dead? What do you mean, dead?

09:53.800 --> 09:56.340
Dead. He blew up, man.

09:56.380 --> 09:57.550
He was my friend.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.890
I just - Please.
Don't do that.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.010
Just don't do that!

10:07.020 --> 10:09.350
Obviously the ball fairies are
on you side, Pally.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.310
Because that was close.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.690
Doyle. Come. Now.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.820
Find me the body.

10:15.360 --> 10:20.120
Hey! What about me? Hello?

10:27.370 --> 10:27.670
You left all of us,

10:29.040 --> 10:30.040
including your ex girlfriend
waiting last night.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.630
What are we doing here,
anyway?

10:32.670 --> 10:33.670
And who is she?

10:34.300 --> 10:34.630
Just- never mind.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.970
And thank you so much for
getting us in here.

10:38.010 --> 10:40.220
Yeah. That would be
breaking you in.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.050
And you're lucky that the
day shift isn't here yet.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.350
- It's too early.
- Name tag.

10:45.810 --> 10:46.890
Alex Marshall.

10:46.930 --> 10:47.230
It's him.

10:48.310 --> 10:50.980
Whoa, whoa. What are
we doing here?

10:52.230 --> 10:52.520
- Oh!
- Oh.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.320
It says here Alex Marshall
blew up in a truck.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.990
It sucks to be him.
Can we go now?

10:59.490 --> 10:59.700
[Alisha] It's not Alex.

11:01.030 --> 11:01.820
Look at him. How could
you possibly know that?

11:02.620 --> 11:03.990
Tell the lawyer to leave.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.750
Hey look.
I want to leave. Trust me.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.620
And do I need to remind you

11:11.670 --> 11:14.710
that you are out on bail
in a murder trial?

11:14.750 --> 11:16.920
And even being here could get
you thrown back inside.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.010
Oh, thanks for bringing it back
to the forefront of my mind.

11:21.970 --> 11:23.970
- [Alisha] Jake-
- Get outta here.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.100
Alex Marshall had, or has -

11:32.150 --> 11:34.900
a maple leaf tattooed
on his right arm.

11:34.940 --> 11:36.360
- Look at this.
- [Jake] Oh.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.690
No, no.
Why would you use gloves?

11:37.730 --> 11:39.360
I mean that would be stupid.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.160
Whoever it is,
this isn't Alex.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.950
Well, he had Alex's wallet.

11:47.490 --> 11:48.750
This body belongs
to George Bray.

11:49.540 --> 11:49.910
What are you, Ravine now?

11:51.120 --> 11:53.000
He worked for us.
I can tell that it's him.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.920
Was he my predecessor?
Let me guess.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.000
He blew up trying to steal a
shit load of guns.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.340
Let's hope you meet with
a better fate.

11:58.960 --> 11:59.880
Who killed him?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.300
Probably Vincent Letto.

12:01.630 --> 12:02.840
We're gonna go over there
right now. So you can

12:02.880 --> 12:03.140
ask him yourself.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.810
And FYI, Letto's
a bit of a psycho.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.270
Great.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.310
[Jake] Explain to me why
you're sending me in there.

12:12.350 --> 12:14.650
To find out where Alex is,
of course.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.150
The vehicle number to the rig

12:16.190 --> 12:17.110
he was driving
will be in Letto's office.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.740
The push button code
is two nine five four.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.370
And... okay.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.700
Let me guess.
You'll be listening.

12:28.740 --> 12:28.990
Every word.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.250
If this wire goes dead,
so does Sloan.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.870
[ring]

12:32.910 --> 12:35.920
Oh, and if you use your cell
phone, I'll know.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.040
I figured.

12:38.040 --> 12:38.340
But please, go ahead.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.630
Answer it. I love a good
domestic dispute.

12:42.880 --> 12:43.800
Hi.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.010
Jake. Are you -

12:45.050 --> 12:46.590
You disappeared last night.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.510
I'm sorry. I'm
working on a case.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.220
I meant to call you, but time
just got away from me.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.480
You're father told me.
It's all right.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.400
It's not my business what
you're up to anyway.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.900
I appreciate that you're
helping me, you know,

12:58.110 --> 12:59.820
not spend the rest of
my life in prison.

12:59.860 --> 13:00.190
Well, I got nothing
better to do

13:01.320 --> 13:02.940
until they put me
back on active duty.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.530
So, might as well clear the
name of the man that I-

13:09.330 --> 13:12.250
I'm not gonna stop working on
your case. Okay?

13:13.580 --> 13:14.500
[beep]

13:18.880 --> 13:20.550
I'll let you know what
I come up with.

13:20.590 --> 13:21.590
Thank you.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.550
What we do for the
ones we love.

13:43.110 --> 13:44.110
Bye bye now.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.540
[beep, beep, beep, beep]

13:59.080 --> 14:00.000
Oof!

14:01.500 --> 14:02.460
[punch]

14:04.630 --> 14:05.630
[punch]

14:08.300 --> 14:09.640
I'll call you back.

14:15.310 --> 14:17.060
I needed some one on one-

14:17.100 --> 14:18.270
uninterrupted alone time.

14:18.310 --> 14:19.560
[Letto]
Do I get a choice?

14:19.610 --> 14:20.810
Hey!

14:20.860 --> 14:22.320
Argh!

14:23.860 --> 14:24.780
Ow!

14:24.820 --> 14:26.030
Sorry, but -

14:26.070 --> 14:27.400
I said uninterrupted.

14:29.030 --> 14:29.370
Who are you?

14:30.620 --> 14:31.950
More importantly.
Do you know who I am?

14:31.990 --> 14:32.330
[Jake] I know
who you are.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.080
I need you to help me find
Alex Marshall.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.370
Son, you're either
the dumbest man

14:37.410 --> 14:39.420
I have ever met, or
you have a serious

14:39.460 --> 14:39.750
death wish coming
in here like this.

14:40.960 --> 14:44.590
I need you to help me find
Alex Marshall.

14:44.630 --> 14:46.090
You're looking for my guns.

14:46.130 --> 14:46.510
Who do you work for?

14:47.880 --> 14:50.550
I'm doing this, you know,
completely all on my own.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.640
By myself.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.430
I'm not working for anyone.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.020
I'll be honest with you -

14:55.060 --> 14:55.350
Jake.

14:56.430 --> 14:58.640
Jake.
I don't know where Alex is.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.310
He went AWOL with a big shipment
of my guns a few days ago.

15:01.350 --> 15:02.900
And no one's heard
of him since.

15:05.280 --> 15:05.530
Hey.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.160
I will double whatever it is
Vick Saul is paying you-

15:10.200 --> 15:12.700
to find Alex and my guns.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.410
I'm not working for anyone
named Saul

15:14.450 --> 15:14.740
- [punch]
- Ugh!

15:16.290 --> 15:20.500
Well, that looks a lot like
Vick Saul's right hand gal.

15:20.540 --> 15:21.920
Sitting in your fancy car.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.460
Alisha, I think her name is.

15:24.250 --> 15:24.550
I need the vehicle number

15:25.800 --> 15:27.670
for the rig that Alex
was driving, please.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.340
I promise.
You give it to me-

15:29.380 --> 15:30.510
I'll leave you alone, alright?

15:30.550 --> 15:30.760
And I promise.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.300
I will never leave you alone-

15:33.350 --> 15:34.680
from here on in.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.600
Saul either.

15:36.470 --> 15:39.690
The vehicle number, please.

15:48.990 --> 15:49.990
Thank you.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.860
And -
Sorry for this.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.660
- For what?
- This.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.830
[punch]

16:07.840 --> 16:08.800
Here you go.

16:12.930 --> 16:13.890
What?

16:13.930 --> 16:15.300
What is wrong with you?

16:15.350 --> 16:17.060
Talking about Saul in
front of Rose.

16:17.100 --> 16:17.390
It's hard for me to remember

16:18.470 --> 16:18.640
all the things
I'm allowed to say.

16:19.560 --> 16:19.890
Things I'm not allowed to say.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.890
For example, I can't talk to
you about sleeping with Tinny.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.650
But then, I have,
many many times.

16:24.690 --> 16:26.900
- [spit]
- Like I just did, just now.

16:26.940 --> 16:29.780
Wow. Anyway, we got four items
left on the repo list.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.610
Now, I'm happy to take
care of it myself.

16:31.650 --> 16:35.240
Because clearly my spirit
isn't as broken as yours.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.700
We need to find a way to check
the chain of evidence log-

16:37.740 --> 16:38.040
at the Police Station.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.200
You think Brogan didn't have
time to get

16:40.250 --> 16:42.000
the CC footage off the drive

16:42.040 --> 16:42.920
before it went in to Evidence?

16:43.580 --> 16:43.790
It's worth a shot.

16:44.710 --> 16:45.000
If there's footage out there-

16:46.580 --> 16:49.170
that'll prove Jake didn't kill
Clarke, we need to find it.

16:49.210 --> 16:50.840
[Mal]
We need to find access-

16:50.880 --> 16:52.420
to the Evidence Locker
at the Station.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.550
I know the perfect deadliest,

16:54.590 --> 16:59.180
hottest, strong professional cop
person who can help us out.

16:59.220 --> 17:00.640
Who I have or haven't-

17:01.180 --> 17:02.100
slept with.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.520
I'll leave.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.190
Hey. I saw Jake.

17:07.730 --> 17:08.690
Where is he?

17:08.730 --> 17:09.070
It would appear-

17:10.530 --> 17:12.690
that he's being held captive
by this super hot missus.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.280
Anyway. He left me this note.

17:16.530 --> 17:16.820
Saul's after Sloan.

17:17.990 --> 17:19.620
We gotta get Sloan out of
school and here.

17:19.660 --> 17:22.370
- Now.
- Oh, here we go. Sloan.

17:22.410 --> 17:25.160
Relax. Relax. I already did
it. She's safe.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.790
I looked her up at the
courthouse.

17:26.830 --> 17:28.290
She gotta get used
to it anyway.

17:28.340 --> 17:29.250
Good.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.630
Okay honey.
I think it's about time

17:32.670 --> 17:34.260
we filled you in on
what's going on.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.510
Oh you think?

17:43.640 --> 17:44.770
What are we doing here?

17:46.690 --> 17:49.610
You wanted Letto to figure out
that I was working for Saul.

17:49.650 --> 17:49.860
Jake.

17:50.980 --> 17:53.190
You knew that there were
security cameras

17:53.230 --> 17:53.570
that faced the street.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.570
You knew that he would see
you sitting in my car.

17:56.610 --> 17:57.740
What are you playing at?

17:58.240 --> 17:59.280
Excuse me?

17:59.950 --> 18:01.580
My mic - is it on?

18:01.620 --> 18:01.990
No.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.580
See I think that you want
Letto to know

18:04.620 --> 18:05.410
that Saul's trying to
steal his guns.

18:06.580 --> 18:07.920
You want them to take
each other out.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.040
So you can be the top dog.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.040
Did I confuse you some how?

18:11.960 --> 18:13.920
You do what I say, when I say.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.130
You don't come up
with theories.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.130
And I am telling you-

18:17.180 --> 18:18.430
to find Alex Marshall-

18:18.470 --> 18:19.890
Or your daughter
becomes a memory.

18:22.970 --> 18:23.430
See that?

18:24.890 --> 18:28.390
That's an imprint of a key for
a room in this motel.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.520
This wallet is Alex's. Happy?

18:30.560 --> 18:31.770
Which is why we're here.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.610
Find the key and the holder.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.990
Uh, this isn't one of
my theories.

18:40.030 --> 18:40.320
So don't get all upset.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.410
But I'm pretty sure that's
one of Letto's men.

18:44.660 --> 18:45.500
Deal with it.

18:46.330 --> 18:48.040
Oh, you are just charming.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.330
I can't wait to bring you home
to meet the father.

18:51.750 --> 18:52.920
[crash]

19:00.470 --> 19:01.760
Stop here. Jake stop.

19:02.890 --> 19:04.600
- I don't believe it.
- [Jake] What?

19:05.310 --> 19:06.310
Is that him?

19:06.350 --> 19:07.600
You guessed it.

19:08.770 --> 19:09.770
Alex Marshall.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.520
Hi Alex.

19:12.270 --> 19:12.650
Y'all here to kill me?

19:13.770 --> 19:14.690
No, buddy, we're not
here to kill you.

19:14.730 --> 19:15.940
I wish it was that simple.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.240
I know I'm not alone in this.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.950
That's good. That's very good.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.200
Does that mean you
were able

19:28.290 --> 19:29.460
to reach out to
someone you trust?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.290
I saw Jake today.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.800
It's more difficult than
I thought.

19:37.130 --> 19:39.010
I'm all over the place
emotionally.

19:39.050 --> 19:40.800
Of course you are.
It's to be expected.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.550
You experienced a very
traumatic event.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.890
Where did you see him?

19:47.770 --> 19:48.350
Why?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.100
Because I haven't cleared
you for active cases.

19:53.230 --> 19:54.230
Bossy.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.650
I'm just trying to do my job.

19:56.690 --> 19:56.860
I'm an investigator.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.570
It's my natural instinct
to investigate.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.700
You got a problem with that?

20:02.450 --> 20:03.740
Of course not.

20:03.780 --> 20:04.070
I've seen the hardest of men

20:05.490 --> 20:07.240
crushed by much less than what
you've been through.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.450
Hardest men?

20:08.490 --> 20:08.790
You know what I mean.

20:09.790 --> 20:11.420
You want me to be
like a hard man?

20:12.620 --> 20:16.550
Leslie. I want you to
let me help you.

20:17.340 --> 20:18.760
Help you face your fears.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.170
How?

20:20.220 --> 20:20.470
By opening up.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.300
That's what these
sessions are all about.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.390
I wanna confront the person
who did this to me.

20:28.430 --> 20:30.180
I wanna rip his lungs
out of his chest.

20:30.220 --> 20:30.430
Is that hard enough for you?

20:31.730 --> 20:33.650
I would strongly advise
against doing that.

20:35.230 --> 20:36.440
I'm exaggerating.

20:37.190 --> 20:38.730
I just want you to focus

20:38.770 --> 20:41.150
on the present
and not dwell on the past.

20:43.110 --> 20:44.950
- Right.
- Okay.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.920
Yeah, I need everything you
have on Jake Doyle.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.050
You're the second person
that's been after me

21:03.090 --> 21:04.590
in the past twenty four hours.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.390
We feel for you. We really do.

21:07.050 --> 21:08.180
Who was the first?

21:08.220 --> 21:09.930
Oh, he's dead. Yeah.

21:09.970 --> 21:10.390
As in deceased.

21:11.430 --> 21:14.140
He died a
seriously grisly death.

21:14.730 --> 21:15.020
Burned alive.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.560
Seared. Yeah. Yeah.
Now it's most likely

21:18.610 --> 21:19.940
the gentleman that hired me

21:19.980 --> 21:21.740
that lit the match.

21:22.530 --> 21:24.240
Where are the guns, Alex?

21:24.280 --> 21:28.120
[laughing] You can torture
me all you want.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.120
But there is zero
chance I'm giving you.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.870
The only leverage I got is
staying alive, understand.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.500
Looks like I found us something

21:36.540 --> 21:38.420
to help speed this process up,

21:39.840 --> 21:42.880
You know, the last time I did
this, the guy puked-

21:42.920 --> 21:43.220
all over my shoes.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.680
Don't do more than one
at once this time.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.260
One what?

21:48.300 --> 21:49.260
[ring]

21:51.310 --> 21:52.350
Hello, Saul.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.230
Just a second.

21:54.770 --> 21:55.060
[beep]

21:56.520 --> 21:58.850
Start form the back teeth and
move your way forward.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.650
Okay. Listen, I just got
these veneers put in.

22:02.690 --> 22:03.030
These nice pearly whites.

22:04.030 --> 22:04.360
And you start pulling
them out-

22:05.650 --> 22:07.700
You won't understand a damn
thing I'm saying.

22:07.740 --> 22:10.120
Shhh. Shut up.
Where's your phone?

22:10.160 --> 22:10.450
In my pocket.

22:11.370 --> 22:13.500
Chest pocket.
Right there.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.830
No talking.

22:19.670 --> 22:20.630
[Mal] Hello?

22:20.670 --> 22:21.040
Listen, I can't talk.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.380
Did you get the
message from Walter?

22:23.420 --> 22:24.800
Sloan is safe at
the Court House.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.130
Where are you to?
What happened?

22:26.380 --> 22:29.090
Actually, I'm
stealing guns for Vick Saul.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.140
It's a long story.

22:30.180 --> 22:30.430
Long story.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.600
Don't wanna pry, but
elaborate, stunned jaws.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.270
I can't talk right now.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.810
Just make sure that Sloan's
safe. Goodbye.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.440
This is getting way out
of control.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.520
Yep. Yes it is.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.820
You'd better go help him.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.190
Yep. Yes I will.

22:43.530 --> 22:48.410
So that thing about never
seeing you- you know-

22:49.110 --> 22:50.570
Naked? Oh,

22:52.160 --> 22:53.540
Slight
exaggeration.

22:59.330 --> 23:00.330
Do not move.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.290
What are you doing?

23:01.330 --> 23:02.340
Shut up.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.510
Jake?

23:11.930 --> 23:12.970
Jake!

23:13.010 --> 23:13.310
You trying to get us killed?

23:14.390 --> 23:15.430
You're not thinking
this through.

23:15.470 --> 23:15.770
Sloan?

23:16.850 --> 23:18.140
Saul's on speed dial.
I call him-

23:18.180 --> 23:19.440
And she's dead.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.560
We both know that I know

23:21.600 --> 23:23.440
that you're gonna
double cross Saul.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.400
So, if I was you, I
would just stay quiet.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.360
[banging]

23:27.400 --> 23:27.650
You're making a mistake.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.950
The date's over, Alisha.
To be honest with ya-

23:30.990 --> 23:32.450
You came on a
little bit strong.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.080
- Let's go.
- If you don't mind,

23:35.120 --> 23:36.410
I prefer to stay here.

23:36.450 --> 23:37.830
Trust me, you don't.

23:41.540 --> 23:42.540
Jake!

23:45.540 --> 23:47.760
What are we doing, man. Come
on, what's in this for you?

23:47.800 --> 23:48.050
What's in this for me?

23:49.470 --> 23:51.840
You are literally alive
because I saved you, okay?

23:51.880 --> 23:53.470
So tell me where the
friggin' guns are.

23:53.510 --> 23:55.430
Jake, I don't know where
the guns are, man.

23:55.470 --> 23:57.680
So why don't you just pull
this pretty little car over

23:57.720 --> 23:59.480
and let me out.
And I'll be on my way.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.850
I got a feeling that-
this phone of yours -

24:01.890 --> 24:03.600
You probably got
Letto's number, right.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.560
You know it's interesting?
When I was in his office.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.860
And he offered me money
to turn you in.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.900
I saw a hack saw in there.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.740
Jake, I need all my
parts, okay?

24:11.780 --> 24:12.030
All of them.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.160
I bet, if I scroll through
this phone here-

24:15.200 --> 24:16.370
[Alex]
You don't gotta do this.

24:16.410 --> 24:18.330
I don't wanna go out like this.

24:18.370 --> 24:19.750
I'm on the phone. Shhh.

24:19.790 --> 24:22.410
Hello?
I'll put it on speaker. Hello?

24:22.460 --> 24:23.920
[Letto] You better be out
front with my guns.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.330
Or taking in your last breath.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.790
[Jake] Sorry Mr. Letto-

24:26.840 --> 24:28.800
Alex. He can't come to the
phone right now.

24:28.840 --> 24:29.840
Doyle.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.470
So you have Alex Marshall.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.510
That's right. It's me.

24:32.550 --> 24:33.880
Does our deal still stand?

24:33.930 --> 24:35.680
Well, that depends. The guns?

24:35.720 --> 24:37.680
Oh, I got 'em.
I got those guns.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.560
No you don't!

24:38.970 --> 24:39.890
Arrgh!

24:40.810 --> 24:42.560
Shut up.
Shut up!

24:42.600 --> 24:44.810
Sorry about that. Look. I
don't care about the guns.

24:45.690 --> 24:46.020
All I care about is money.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.730
And I wanna get out of this
deal that I'm stuck with,

24:49.780 --> 24:50.110
with Vick Saul.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.610
I'm not sure that's
possible, but go on.

24:52.650 --> 24:52.950
I propose a trade.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.620
Guns for money. I'll text you
the time and location.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.160
Throw Alex into the mix and
you've got yourself a deal.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.000
Is Alex a part of the deal?

25:01.040 --> 25:02.120
He and I have-

25:02.160 --> 25:03.540
business to discuss.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.330
It' possible. Stand by.

25:06.460 --> 25:07.880
You hit like a bitch.

25:09.290 --> 25:10.800
The way I see it, you got two
options here, Alex.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.970
Number one -
I turn you into the mobster

25:14.010 --> 25:15.300
who thinks that you've
betrayed him.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.140
And will most definitely
disembowel you,

25:17.180 --> 25:19.050
because he's got
no other hobbies.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.060
Or you can tell me where the
friggin' guns are.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.310
I just remembered where
the guns are.

25:25.270 --> 25:28.020
See, that's the
healthy choice.

25:51.090 --> 25:52.210
[Brogan]
Leslie Bennett.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.800
I'm humbled.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.090
And amused after
all this time,

25:57.130 --> 25:58.680
you decided to come and visit.

25:59.550 --> 26:01.430
So evolved.
Impressive.

26:03.680 --> 26:04.230
I didn't come to make
nice, Brogan.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.810
Be hard to forgive and forget,
seeing how you locked-

26:07.850 --> 26:09.690
me in a box six
feet underground.

26:10.940 --> 26:11.270
That's a good point.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.070
So, what can I do
for you, then?

26:14.110 --> 26:15.780
Some new age therapy? Meet
your attacker, kind of thing?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.030
Looks like your room mates are
getting to know you.

26:19.740 --> 26:20.030
I like the bruises.

26:21.410 --> 26:23.410
Only wish there were a few
more to even you out.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.540
Well, maybe when Jake gets ace
in here, he'll have my back.

26:29.290 --> 26:30.380
You know something?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.590
I just can't stop
thinking about you.

26:34.710 --> 26:36.420
I tend to have that
effect on people.

26:36.470 --> 26:36.680
Do tell Miss Bennett?

26:38.130 --> 26:39.720
How did you know I was going
to Clarke's that night?

26:39.760 --> 26:40.760
To his house?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.390
I followed you. Sergeant.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.060
No, you were there
when I arrived,

26:45.100 --> 26:46.680
which means you knew
I was headed there.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.400
You knew I was going to
Clarke's house.

26:52.060 --> 26:52.940
Well, well, well.

26:54.230 --> 26:56.700
Someone's decided to be a
Police Woman again.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.700
So- What do you think?

27:01.410 --> 27:02.410
I had an inside guy?

27:03.120 --> 27:04.450
Cop on the payroll?

27:04.490 --> 27:05.410
Or a woman.

27:08.580 --> 27:09.830
You know, Leslie-

27:10.420 --> 27:11.790
In another life.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.290
You and I? We
could have been an item,

27:14.210 --> 27:15.670
Stranger things have happened.

27:19.090 --> 27:19.800
I'll find out who it was.

27:20.970 --> 27:21.970
And I'll find out exactly
what happened.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.930
And trust me. When I do,
I'll make sure-

27:24.970 --> 27:27.980
you never get out of this
place as long as you live.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.820
Still in the dog house?

27:41.860 --> 27:43.530
Not anymore, I don't think.

27:43.570 --> 27:45.540
No thanks to Des or you or
everyone, it seems.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.160
I hope buddy's got a bullet
proof vest

27:48.200 --> 27:48.540
underneath that fancy shirt.

27:49.750 --> 27:49.960
I couldn't leave him
there to get killed.

27:51.210 --> 27:53.130
I mean, I kinda wanted to.
But I couldn't.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.090
So we're arms dealers now?

27:55.130 --> 27:56.250
Something like that. Hey!

27:56.300 --> 27:57.670
Which one is yours?

27:57.710 --> 27:58.010
This your daddy?

27:59.130 --> 28:00.930
That depends.
What did he do to you.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.260
I never had a daddy.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.890
Maybe you should
cherish this moment.

28:03.930 --> 28:04.220
- You're a lucky man.
- Yeah, lucky.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.560
If he doesn't get me killed.
Now shut up and find your rig.

28:07.600 --> 28:07.810
You seem nice.

28:09.140 --> 28:11.190
But your boy here, he
seems a little touched.

28:11.230 --> 28:12.600
Yeah. We think he's adopted.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.610
- Hahaha.
- [phone rings]

28:15.060 --> 28:15.320
Hi.

28:16.940 --> 28:18.530
Sorry about the time-out but I
couldn't have you following me.

28:18.570 --> 28:19.490
I have a tracker on
your phone.

28:19.530 --> 28:20.440
Did you forget that?

28:20.490 --> 28:21.320
Yes, actually, I did.

28:22.110 --> 28:22.700
It's my rig right here.

28:24.200 --> 28:28.490
Look, Alisha. I know it feels
like you've been screwed.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.620
But please know, that's not
what I'm trying to do.

28:30.660 --> 28:31.620
If you screwed me, Jake-

28:31.660 --> 28:33.080
Trust me, you'd know.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.130
Uh.

28:34.170 --> 28:34.460
What do you want?

28:36.040 --> 28:38.710
Look. We did this your way.
Now we're doing it mine, okay?

28:38.750 --> 28:41.720
Follow the tracker on my
phone. You can have the guns.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.430
We get to keep Alex. Deal?

28:44.470 --> 28:45.640
Already on my way.

28:46.720 --> 28:47.640
Smart cover.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.640
Blu- Ray players.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.850
What's with all the
explosives?

28:52.890 --> 28:54.480
I thought this was
just about guns.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.810
I just drive. I don't
know what's inside.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.110
What now?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.530
Now.

29:00.780 --> 29:02.240
I've got a bit of a plan.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.320
[message sound]

29:08.030 --> 29:10.450
This repo work is killing me.

29:10.490 --> 29:13.290
The dirty looks. The insults.
The cursing and swearing.

29:13.330 --> 29:14.000
And that's just from Malachy.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.460
Did you get Poppy's
truck back?

29:16.500 --> 29:19.380
Almost. I only gotta do three-

29:19.420 --> 29:21.090
fifty seven more repo jobs.

29:21.130 --> 29:23.630
Do you think you can fit a
thirty two inch TV

29:23.670 --> 29:26.010
into a twenty six inch trunk?

29:27.300 --> 29:29.010
I can't find any record of
Brogan's computer

29:29.050 --> 29:30.140
being signed out of evidence.

29:30.720 --> 29:31.600
What do you got?

29:31.640 --> 29:31.980
Wait.

29:33.430 --> 29:33.730
According to the internal log
on Brogan's computer,

29:35.270 --> 29:38.060
it was turned on a couple of
days after he was arrested.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.520
When it was already in the
Evident Lockup?

29:40.270 --> 29:40.570
No one signed it out.

29:41.730 --> 29:43.490
Someone wiped the
footage from the inside.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.450
Inside here, inside?

29:46.490 --> 29:48.660
Are you suggesting a cop is in
on this with Brogan?

29:48.700 --> 29:51.330
I'm suggesting we don't talk
about it here, okay?

29:51.370 --> 29:52.790
Trust no one.

30:17.810 --> 30:18.650
Alisha Maracle.

30:19.270 --> 30:20.400
Been a long time.

30:20.440 --> 30:20.770
It has, Letto.

30:22.070 --> 30:22.320
You looking for something
that belongs to me?

30:23.570 --> 30:24.740
Jake Doyle. When I find him,
he's a dead man.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.910
Let's find out who ends
up dead first.

30:46.170 --> 30:47.970
I think she feels right at
home here.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.050
I don't think she's ever
gonna beat your record.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.970
[Jake] Yeah, look. Just put her
on the phone.

30:53.010 --> 30:53.930
And thanks for doing this.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.430
Pleasure is all mine.

30:59.940 --> 31:00.650
Hello? How are you?

31:01.520 --> 31:01.860
This is your idea of a joke?

31:03.320 --> 31:04.820
Did you get it out of the Bad
Parenting Handbook?

31:04.860 --> 31:06.860
Vick Saul is threatening
to kill you.

31:06.900 --> 31:08.490
Do I need you to remind
you why that is?

31:08.530 --> 31:10.240
No need. Thank you.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.950
I know it doesn't feel like
it. But this is the-

31:11.990 --> 31:14.080
safest place for you to be
here right now.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.580
It smells in here worse that
your lawyer.

31:16.620 --> 31:18.830
- Do you trust me?
- No, but do I have a choice?

31:18.870 --> 31:20.120
Tell Walter I'll call
him later.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.210
Relax, you don't smell.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.750
I just wanna get out of here.

31:23.790 --> 31:26.170
I know you do. But stop
sooking. Okay?

31:26.210 --> 31:27.260
I love you.

31:32.090 --> 31:32.390
She okay?

31:33.760 --> 31:35.430
I wouldn't say that. But I'm
sure she'll be fine.

31:35.470 --> 31:35.770
I know I've been hard on her.

31:36.890 --> 31:38.270
And I really
don't mean to come across

31:38.310 --> 31:39.770
as the evil
step grandmother here.

31:39.810 --> 31:40.140
No, no, no, no.

31:41.350 --> 31:43.150
She's done some very
unforgivable things.

31:43.190 --> 31:44.980
I do think there's something
else at play here.

31:45.020 --> 31:46.780
I felt it the moment
I met that girl.

31:46.820 --> 31:48.030
[Alex]
Hello?

31:48.070 --> 31:49.490
We've got a massive amount of-

31:49.530 --> 31:51.820
guns stashed that we can't
sell because

31:51.860 --> 31:53.240
everybody hates us.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.870
So, what's our play?

31:55.910 --> 31:57.160
We've got Vick Saul-

31:57.200 --> 31:58.450
right where we wants him.

31:58.500 --> 31:58.710
Why doesn't that comfort me?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.750
We're playing with this
Alisha's life here.

32:01.790 --> 32:04.040
This is our only way to get
clear of Saul.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.670
Okay. We make a trade to
Letto.

32:05.710 --> 32:07.840
The guns for Alisha. Simple.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.260
[Mal]
Saul's unstable.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.550
Completely unpredictable.

32:10.590 --> 32:11.590
That's great to hear.

32:11.630 --> 32:11.880
[Jake]
I know him.

32:13.510 --> 32:16.310
As soon as he finds out what's
going on, he's going to call us.

32:16.350 --> 32:16.640
I guarantee you.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.520
Hello, darling. Aren't you
a little ray of sunshine.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.980
- Hello.
- Ignore him.

32:22.020 --> 32:25.020
Name's Alex Mar- Waters.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.900
I gotta hit the head. Now.

32:33.070 --> 32:35.570
It's over there. But there's
no window.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.700
And we're on the third floor.

32:36.740 --> 32:37.830
So good luck trying to escape.

32:37.870 --> 32:38.830
Thank you.

32:38.870 --> 32:39.500
What's going on?

32:40.620 --> 32:42.540
That guy is Vincent
Letto's Wheelman.

32:42.580 --> 32:42.870
And he's a
professional-

32:43.960 --> 32:46.420
smuggler. Guns, drugs.
You name it.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.500
Client?

32:49.170 --> 32:50.090
Sure.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.130
Not exactly.

32:51.170 --> 32:51.510
Actually -

32:52.840 --> 32:54.260
We're gonna need your help on
this one, Leslie.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.680
[phone rings]

33:00.600 --> 33:01.810
It's for you.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.230
See. Told you.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.570
I gotta take this. I promise I
won't disappear.

33:09.110 --> 33:11.990
Yeah, listen. Do not send the
Animal this time. Alright?

33:12.820 --> 33:14.320
I'm make my own way there.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.240
Just go.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.120
We can talk later.

33:18.620 --> 33:19.620
Thank you.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.080
You're not
listening to me.

33:27.130 --> 33:27.420
You don't have the guns.

33:28.710 --> 33:29.920
And Letto has Alisha.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.630
Yes and yes but-

33:31.670 --> 33:32.130
- [punch]
- Ooof!

33:32.880 --> 33:34.300
Give me second, will ya?

33:34.340 --> 33:36.260
Do you have any idea what
you've done?

33:36.300 --> 33:36.640
I haven't done anything.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.220
That's what I'm friggin'
trying to tell ya.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.890
Alisha is like a daughter
to me, Jake.

33:40.930 --> 33:42.600
You don't mess with
a man's family.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.600
Really?

33:44.140 --> 33:45.060
Really Saul?

33:45.100 --> 33:45.400
[punch]

33:46.480 --> 33:48.770
Would you just give
me a second?!

33:48.810 --> 33:51.400
I've raised Alisha since she
was a little girl.

33:51.440 --> 33:51.650
Fortunately,

33:52.650 --> 33:53.990
I know exactly
what it's like-

33:54.030 --> 33:55.820
to have a child in harms
way, remember?

33:55.860 --> 33:56.910
That was business.

33:56.950 --> 33:58.280
So is this.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.780
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

33:59.830 --> 34:00.160
I have a plan.

34:01.580 --> 34:03.370
What could you that I couldn't
possibly do myself?

34:03.410 --> 34:04.870
If you had a plan -

34:04.910 --> 34:06.540
you'd be out executing it

34:06.580 --> 34:08.380
as opposed to having
this idiot stand here and-

34:08.420 --> 34:09.590
punch me in the guts.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.840
Okay. Okay. I'm listening.

34:12.670 --> 34:14.470
Letto's expecting an army.

34:14.510 --> 34:15.760
Not just one man.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.130
I think I can go get him.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.720
Why would I believe you?

34:18.760 --> 34:22.100
Because I'm talking to you
father to father.

34:22.140 --> 34:23.270
If I get Alisha-

34:23.310 --> 34:23.890
You leave Sloan alone.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.690
And the debt between
us is over.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.650
You understand me?

34:27.690 --> 34:28.020
What if I say no?

34:29.480 --> 34:31.320
Then Alisha becomes a casualty
at the hands of Letto.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.320
You're choice.

34:34.690 --> 34:36.320
You bring back Alisha.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.780
If I lose mine,
you lose yours.

34:38.320 --> 34:38.610
Guaranteed.

34:39.910 --> 34:41.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just
cut me down, will ya?

34:45.200 --> 34:46.410
I want a list of
everyone who was

34:46.460 --> 34:47.830
authorized to be in the Station

34:47.870 --> 34:48.170
on the day that Clarke
was murdered.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.460
That includes Police personnel
and contractors, understood?

34:53.670 --> 34:54.710
Hood.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
Sergeant?

34:55.800 --> 34:56.130
When I went to see Clarke-

34:57.590 --> 34:59.090
Are you sure you didn't tell
anyone where I was going?

34:59.130 --> 35:01.140
No, I'm sure I didn't
say a word.

35:01.180 --> 35:02.390
You gotta let this go.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.430
I got a proposition for you.

35:07.480 --> 35:07.770
[Letto] Unless it involves

35:08.850 --> 35:09.150
finding you, taking
back my guns-

35:10.560 --> 35:13.770
And killing you slowly after -
I am not interested.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.780
Sorry you feel that way.

35:14.820 --> 35:15.110
You'll get over it.

35:16.490 --> 35:17.950
But I think I'm gonna pop in
and see you anyhow.

35:17.990 --> 35:18.320
Please do.

35:19.570 --> 35:20.990
I've given my men a
shoot on sight order.

35:21.030 --> 35:22.660
Well. Thanks for the heads-up.

35:27.160 --> 35:27.910
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.040
It's you're last chance.

35:30.540 --> 35:32.540
You can go home if you want
to. You can call it quits.

35:32.580 --> 35:33.500
You can just give up.

35:34.630 --> 35:36.010
You just might want
to consider it.

35:36.710 --> 35:38.050
[gun cocks]

35:39.840 --> 35:40.720
[crack]

35:43.050 --> 35:44.010
What do you want?

35:44.640 --> 35:45.520
You got it?

35:49.230 --> 35:49.890
I need your help.

35:51.230 --> 35:53.520
And I got a feeling you're
gonna give it to me.

35:58.360 --> 35:58.610
Don't worry buddy. I promise.

35:59.990 --> 36:01.700
If you does what I ask,
I'll be right behind you.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.370
The entire time.

36:03.410 --> 36:04.870
What do you say?

36:04.910 --> 36:06.370
Feel in the helping mood,
or what?

36:07.500 --> 36:09.410
Come on, now.
Think about it. Quickly.

36:14.750 --> 36:15.670
Yeah.

36:16.420 --> 36:17.340
Good call.

36:20.420 --> 36:21.590
[knocking]

36:26.390 --> 36:27.470
Alvaro. What happened?

36:27.510 --> 36:28.430
Did you killed Doyle?

36:28.470 --> 36:29.560
Sorry, boss.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.730
You gotta be kidding me.

36:35.770 --> 36:36.770
What are you at, b'ys?

36:38.900 --> 36:40.070
What do you think?

36:40.110 --> 36:41.200
Wanna get outta here?

36:41.240 --> 36:42.320
Yeah.

36:43.780 --> 36:44.820
Thanks Alvaro, buddy.

36:45.950 --> 36:49.330
Oh. You guys probably
what these pins.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.460
Catch.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.290
Boss?

37:00.630 --> 37:02.130
Letto's not gonna
take the bait.

37:02.170 --> 37:02.720
He'll take it.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.890
Hey, Alex. Are you sure
your buddy Craig

37:05.930 --> 37:08.010
got the word out where the
rig was stashed?

37:08.060 --> 37:10.310
You guys hear me through this?

37:10.350 --> 37:12.100
Yeah. The mic - it works
through fabric-

37:12.140 --> 37:12.350
You bellhead.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.150
Stop touching yourself and
answer the man.

37:15.190 --> 37:15.770
Hey Jake.

37:16.650 --> 37:18.110
Do I have permission to run?

37:18.150 --> 37:19.570
Have you been paying
attention?

37:19.610 --> 37:21.070
Do you want me to
come after you?

37:21.110 --> 37:23.740
- No
- Then do not run.

37:23.780 --> 37:24.740
Just smile.

37:24.780 --> 37:25.700
You're good at that.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.200
You'll have it today.

37:31.910 --> 37:32.330
I guarantee it.

37:33.370 --> 37:35.500
Letto. I see you got
my message.

37:35.540 --> 37:35.830
Once I check the cargo-

37:37.290 --> 37:38.840
You can turn around and finish
off what you started.

37:38.880 --> 37:39.800
Then you're a dead man.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.760
That sounds reasonable.

37:42.550 --> 37:45.550
Well, about this cargo-

37:46.590 --> 37:47.090
What about it?

37:48.300 --> 37:51.020
It doesn't look like it's
going anywhere.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.560
[sirens]

37:57.060 --> 37:58.690
Put your hands where I can
see 'em, Letto.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.780
Let's see your hands.

38:01.730 --> 38:03.440
Move, move. Come on.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.990
Hands behind the back.
Let's go boys.

38:15.250 --> 38:15.540
I don't see my merchandise.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.460
Maybe you already sold it and
you're bringing me a

38:18.500 --> 38:19.000
Cashier's Cheque.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.460
Do you remember our
conversation?

38:21.880 --> 38:22.130
I do.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.510
Okay look.
Letto went down.

38:24.550 --> 38:25.590
The cops have the guns.

38:25.630 --> 38:26.970
Which means only one thing.

38:27.010 --> 38:27.550
[Alisha]
More territory.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.140
Less competition.

38:29.180 --> 38:30.510
So I lose a battle.

38:30.550 --> 38:32.640
But we win a war.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.730
You know, it's too bad we made
our little arrangement.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.650
You've been pretty
valuable to me.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.940
Let's not get cute here, Saul.

38:40.980 --> 38:41.320
Watch yourself Doyle.

38:42.860 --> 38:45.110
You may think you have an idea
of who I am. But trust me.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.320
You do not.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.620
So good to have you back.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.040
See our friend out, will you?

39:00.920 --> 39:01.170
Don't look so sad.

39:02.420 --> 39:03.880
You brought down
the second biggest gangster

39:03.920 --> 39:05.010
on the East Coast.

39:05.050 --> 39:05.340
How's your buddy Alex?

39:06.720 --> 39:08.550
He's being charged for theft
over five thousand.

39:08.590 --> 39:10.300
But seeing how he helped take
Letto down,

39:10.340 --> 39:10.550
I'm sure he'll be fine.

39:11.470 --> 39:13.260
It's a pity this ride is over.

39:13.310 --> 39:14.430
You and me. We had something.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.730
Well, if you call you ordering
me around

39:17.770 --> 39:18.850
to punish people something-

39:18.890 --> 39:20.100
Then, sure.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.730
Don't be scarce, Jake Doyle.

39:23.230 --> 39:24.280
What?

39:25.570 --> 39:26.690
I should go.

39:27.820 --> 39:28.990
Yeah.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.120
Get out.

39:36.950 --> 39:37.870
Please.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.040
Yeah.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.800
[Ronan] I guess we both
work late hours.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.630
Jake, right?
We met before.

40:31.670 --> 40:32.970
Something you want to
say to me, doctor?

40:34.180 --> 40:36.850
My patients need my
guidance. Sometimes.

40:36.890 --> 40:39.270
I'm contracted by the Force,
but I always have my patients'

40:39.310 --> 40:40.770
best interest at heart.

40:40.810 --> 40:42.560
I'd be terrible at my job
if I didn't.

40:43.900 --> 40:44.230
Why is it I get this feeling

40:45.360 --> 40:47.150
that you're about
to cross some really

40:47.190 --> 40:48.650
creepy line with me?

40:48.690 --> 40:50.150
I'm not gonna do
anything of the sort.

40:50.190 --> 40:51.860
I'm just talking
to a person -

40:51.900 --> 40:55.120
who I know cares a great deal
about another person

40:55.160 --> 40:55.570
that we both might know.

40:57.030 --> 40:58.990
You're talking about Leslie.
So why don't you just say

40:59.040 --> 40:59.370
what it is
that you gotta say.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.250
And stop getting on like the
friggin' Riddler.

41:03.580 --> 41:06.290
I know you don't want any
trouble for her.

41:07.540 --> 41:09.750
So keep her away
from your mess-

41:09.800 --> 41:11.470
Before you take her
down with you.

41:12.630 --> 41:15.470
Again. That's all I'm
trying to say.

41:17.550 --> 41:19.390
Sounds to me like a
bit of a threat.

41:19.430 --> 41:19.720
No.

41:21.310 --> 41:23.020
Jake. I'm just trying to point
you in the right direction.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.480
I don't have the power
to make threats.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.440
Just warnings.
Have a good night.

41:31.360 --> 41:31.690
Here we are.

41:33.070 --> 41:35.450
Your daughter. And your lawyer
slash baby sitter.

41:35.490 --> 41:36.410
You okay?

41:36.450 --> 41:38.330
Yeah, I'm okay. You?

41:38.780 --> 41:39.910
I'm fine.

41:40.620 --> 41:41.620
Are we good?

41:41.660 --> 41:43.040
Yeah, I think we're good.

41:52.340 --> 41:54.800
Number one priority is finding
some hard evidence-

41:54.840 --> 41:56.220
to keep you neck out of a noose.

41:56.260 --> 41:56.550
I know there's
footage out there.

41:58.100 --> 41:59.800
Proving that I didn't kill
Clarke. We just gotta find it.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.640
And the only way to get
at that footage

42:01.680 --> 42:02.020
would involve
Walter and a lawyer.

42:03.600 --> 42:06.350
When you put it that way, it
doesn't sound super promising.

42:06.390 --> 42:09.190
On another note - I
ran into Leslie's shrink.

42:09.230 --> 42:09.570
Apparently,

42:10.980 --> 42:12.070
she's gonna be in a
lot of trouble with the Force.

42:12.110 --> 42:13.320
Because she's been helping us.

42:13.360 --> 42:13.650
Makes sense.

42:15.030 --> 42:16.360
You might want to tell her to
keep her distance.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.200
That's not gonna go
over very well.

42:19.740 --> 42:20.080
Well. Hi.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.410
Hi. I have something to
tell you guys.

42:24.040 --> 42:24.370
Oh God. What now?

42:25.660 --> 42:28.210
The fact that Jake has made
his largest enemy

42:28.250 --> 42:29.840
the biggest crime
boss in the city?

42:29.880 --> 42:30.790
Very funny.

42:30.840 --> 42:31.710
No.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.960
Ta da!

42:35.840 --> 42:37.050
Christian!

42:37.090 --> 42:38.010
Dad!

42:40.510 --> 42:41.430
Fellas.

42:41.470 --> 42:42.470
It's good to be home.

42:42.510 --> 42:43.680
[Jake]
Good to see you.

42:43.720 --> 42:44.980
To what do we
owe this honor?

42:45.020 --> 42:46.060
Christian?

42:46.100 --> 42:47.140
I wanted to be near family.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.100
Why is that?

42:48.150 --> 42:48.980
Because, brother.

42:49.730 --> 42:51.110
I'm getting
married!
