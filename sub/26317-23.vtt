WEBVTT

00:00.313 --> 00:01.826
Previously on S.W.A.T.

00:01.827 --> 00:03.827
I'm not gonna let them
put you in a group home.

00:03.913 --> 00:06.147
We both want you to stay here.

00:06.182 --> 00:08.250
Hondo, the boy was shot

00:08.284 --> 00:09.484
while making deliveries on his job.

00:09.518 --> 00:10.952
Should've left him in juvie

00:10.987 --> 00:13.288
where I could
look out for him. He's my son,

00:13.322 --> 00:14.789
not yours.

00:14.824 --> 00:16.791
He was trying to
stop someone from stealing.

00:16.826 --> 00:17.959
He'll be able to walk, but he'll never

00:17.994 --> 00:19.470
have full functionality.

00:19.504 --> 00:20.762
But he's gonna live.

00:20.796 --> 00:22.230
The FBI has been tracking

00:22.265 --> 00:24.232
a ring of sex traffickers
operating out of Jalisco.

00:24.267 --> 00:25.267
We want you.

00:25.301 --> 00:26.935
She's trying to poach you, Cortez.

00:26.969 --> 00:28.069
Even if we intercept, how are we supposed

00:28.104 --> 00:29.671
to stop a truck going that fast?

00:29.705 --> 00:31.906
Only one way.

00:31.941 --> 00:33.575
- You okay?
- I can't move.

00:33.609 --> 00:35.310
You know, the way
you saved those people...

00:35.344 --> 00:37.612
rumor is you're being considered
for the Police Star.

00:37.647 --> 00:39.981
It's my mom again.
She hasn't checked with in her PO and if

00:40.016 --> 00:41.250
she misses one more meeting...

00:41.275 --> 00:42.684
They'll put out a warrant and revoke her.

00:42.718 --> 00:44.286
Well, I got a fraud alert
for a credit card

00:44.320 --> 00:46.421
I never signed up for,
and it's got to be her.

00:46.455 --> 00:48.323
You're the one who sold
my credit card information?

00:48.357 --> 00:51.293
- Where is my mom?
- You might not like what you find.

00:51.327 --> 00:53.595
The Emancipators want $540 million

00:53.629 --> 00:55.263
to be distributed to various charities.

00:55.298 --> 00:56.798
We took five employees

00:56.832 --> 00:59.444
from five of the largest
corporations in Los Angeles.

00:59.478 --> 01:02.037
Sergeant Daniel Harrelson,
I bet you joined the LAPD

01:02.071 --> 01:03.938
thinking you'd change
the system from within.

01:03.973 --> 01:05.399
Let's see how cocky you are

01:05.424 --> 01:07.842
when you ain't got a mask
or a camera to hide behind.

01:07.877 --> 01:08.986
Hello?

01:09.011 --> 01:10.612
Surely you didn't think this was over.

01:10.646 --> 01:12.681
You just gave me
five megaphones to spread

01:12.715 --> 01:15.016
my message to the world. Thank you.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.370 --> 01:37.005
Mom. Mom. Come on.

01:37.039 --> 01:38.873
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey, watch, watch, watch.

01:38.908 --> 01:40.241
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
- No, no, no, no.

01:40.276 --> 01:43.078
- Shh.
- What's going on?

01:43.112 --> 01:44.913
- Who the hell are you?
- Bryce.

01:44.947 --> 01:47.916
So, you leave the apartment
and disappear for weeks

01:47.950 --> 01:50.852
without a word and start using
again 'cause you chose this guy?

01:50.886 --> 01:52.554
Name ain't "this guy."

01:52.588 --> 01:56.057
It's Bryce, and you need to go.

01:57.293 --> 01:58.860
Listen...

01:58.894 --> 02:01.363
Okay. Hey, stop it.

02:01.397 --> 02:02.931
Stop it, stop it.

02:02.965 --> 02:05.066
- Eddie, baby, please.
- Yeah. Who the hell is Eddie?

02:06.635 --> 02:08.436
Eddie was my father.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.939
You know, I... I love

02:10.973 --> 02:12.607
the way you fight for me, Eddie.

02:12.641 --> 02:15.510
I'm not Eddie. I'm Jim. I'm your son.

02:15.544 --> 02:16.945
What?

02:16.979 --> 02:18.247
I'm your son.

02:19.615 --> 02:21.249
I...

02:22.209 --> 02:24.052
Oh, Jimmy.

02:26.122 --> 02:29.290
I'm gonna... straighten things up.

02:29.778 --> 02:30.878
Um...

02:31.460 --> 02:32.794
What's she on?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.845
We took a mix...
a little of a lot of things.

02:35.879 --> 02:37.152
Are you hungry?

02:37.186 --> 02:38.433
I can make you some waffles.

02:38.467 --> 02:39.934
I don't want any waffles, Ma.

02:39.969 --> 02:41.636
Well, uh, might have to go

02:41.670 --> 02:43.071
To the store, though.

02:43.105 --> 02:44.806
What's...

02:44.840 --> 02:46.408
- Come here.
- Uh-oh.

02:46.442 --> 02:47.901
Hey, come here.

02:48.694 --> 02:50.211
- I'm taking her home.
- Oh.

02:50.246 --> 02:52.247
Bryce.

02:56.368 --> 02:58.453
How's the physical therapy coming?

02:58.487 --> 03:00.555
Well, he's starting to get
strength back in his leg.

03:00.589 --> 03:02.385
It's not bad for two weeks
after getting shot, but...

03:02.410 --> 03:03.458
Could be better.

03:03.492 --> 03:05.260
He's just really bummed. I'm
trying to get him to stand up

03:05.294 --> 03:08.630
and take steps on his own, but
Darryl has to want to do it.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.166
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.477
Hey.

03:14.656 --> 03:16.356
You ready to get up out of here?

03:16.391 --> 03:18.092
Doctor says you can go home tomorrow.

03:18.126 --> 03:21.228
- It's cool.
- What you watching?

03:21.262 --> 03:23.083
Um, some video about
some strange-looking animals.

03:23.118 --> 03:25.532
- Oh, yeah? What country are they in?
- I don't know.

03:25.567 --> 03:27.248
Another place I've never been to.

03:27.283 --> 03:29.985
Darryl, the doctor says
you requested no visitors.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.273
I can't even walk straight.

03:34.743 --> 03:36.443
Don't know if I ever will.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.218
I can't have people see me like this.

03:41.899 --> 03:43.584
I was named after my dad's friend, right?

03:43.618 --> 03:44.651
Yeah.

03:45.754 --> 03:47.755
He got shot, too.

03:48.128 --> 03:50.457
Maybe this is like some type
of curse or something.

03:50.492 --> 03:51.601
Come on, Darryl.
You can't think like that.

03:51.626 --> 03:52.837
And how am I supposed to think?

03:52.871 --> 03:54.164
It's gonna take a minute.

03:54.198 --> 03:56.463
And it's literally gonna
be one step at a time.

03:56.887 --> 03:58.432
Easy for you to say.

04:04.005 --> 04:05.906
Dad, I wanted to catch you
before your shift started.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.841
Molly, perfect timing.

04:07.876 --> 04:09.615
You still haven't told me
what brings you to town.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.251
Can't a loving daughter just surprise

04:11.276 --> 04:12.852
- her father for a visit?
- Okay.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.420
I stopped by the dry
cleaners like you asked.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.422
Here are your dress blues,
starched and creased.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.824
Excellent. I'm gonna need these
for the Police Star ceremony.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.920
Speaking of which, Deacon, congrats.

04:21.954 --> 04:23.455
Congrats on what?

04:24.414 --> 04:26.732
Brass decided
to award me the Police Star.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.102
Seriously? What, for saving
lives at the Love All parade?

04:30.137 --> 04:32.104
Deac! Dude, I knew
you were in the running.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.207
I had no idea that you got it.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.908
Why didn't you say anything, man?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.410
I'm just not sure how I feel about it.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.345
Dude, the Police Star's one

04:39.379 --> 04:40.913
of the highest honors in the LAPD, man.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.848
No one in my family's ever won it.

04:42.883 --> 04:46.419
Hey. I'm humbled by it, I am.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.921
But after the year
I put everyone through,

04:49.615 --> 04:51.215
not sure I deserve it.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.228
Hey, if you need help with
that speech, I got you.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.274
Captain. Good to see you again.

05:11.308 --> 05:12.587
You, too, Abby.

05:12.621 --> 05:14.814
It took us two tries
to catch these Emancipators.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.662
No way I was gonna miss
a pre-trial of the year.

05:17.687 --> 05:18.775
I hear City Hall

05:18.795 --> 05:21.048
might be eyeing you for a
promotion. Any comment?

05:21.082 --> 05:23.237
Why don't you stick to the story
Harold sent you to cover?

05:23.271 --> 05:25.534
What can I say? I'm greedy.

05:27.539 --> 05:29.273
People of Los Angeles.

05:29.298 --> 05:30.765
We will not be silenced
by corporations any longer.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.471
Order!

05:32.496 --> 05:33.462
That's the same stuff

05:33.487 --> 05:35.288
they've been saying
since we arrested them.

05:35.313 --> 05:37.047
Cinque said they would be megaphones

05:37.072 --> 05:38.342
to spread his message.

05:38.367 --> 05:39.434
It's time to rise up
and rebel against it.

05:39.459 --> 05:41.410
Settle down! Order!

05:41.411 --> 05:42.966
So, this is normal for them?

05:42.991 --> 05:44.552
The time to be good to
each other has passed.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.771
Order! Deputies.

05:45.806 --> 05:47.673
The system will be burned to ashes,

05:47.708 --> 05:49.241
starting with this courthouse.

05:49.276 --> 05:50.776
No. That's new.

05:52.245 --> 05:54.413
Oh, my God!

05:54.448 --> 05:55.448
Oh, no!

06:00.093 --> 06:02.254
Ladies and gentlemen of Los Angeles,

06:02.289 --> 06:03.923
the intermission is over.

06:03.957 --> 06:05.458
Is everyone ready for the final act?

06:05.492 --> 06:07.460
Cinque. They must have hacked the feed.

06:07.494 --> 06:08.861
There's a saying.

06:08.895 --> 06:11.731
"Poverty is genocide in slow motion."

06:11.765 --> 06:13.733
We have come to stop the genocide.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.468
People suffer from lies,

06:15.502 --> 06:17.737
an us-versus-them narrative that is sold

06:17.771 --> 06:21.240
to divide good people and never
help them in any meaningful way.

06:21.274 --> 06:22.541
And do you know
who benefits from these lies?

06:22.576 --> 06:24.043
I'll give you a hint.

06:24.077 --> 06:27.413
It isn't the poor
or the hungry or the meek.

06:27.447 --> 06:29.448
It's the oppressors.

06:31.118 --> 06:33.152
The Los Angeles superior courthouse

06:33.186 --> 06:34.954
is a symbol of oppression.

06:34.988 --> 06:36.388
That's City Councilman Strub

06:36.423 --> 06:37.957
and Councilman Washington.

06:37.991 --> 06:39.391
And City Controller Gwen Miller.

06:39.426 --> 06:40.926
These institutions cannot be trusted,

06:40.961 --> 06:43.562
so we are convening our own court.

06:43.597 --> 06:45.264
A court for the people.

06:50.370 --> 06:51.771
That's the 4th Street bridge.

06:51.805 --> 06:53.172
Get some unis down there now.

06:53.206 --> 06:54.640
Right away.

06:54.674 --> 06:56.675
No. No, no, this is a mistake.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.077
There's been no mistake.

06:58.111 --> 06:59.745
You are Tony Strub,

06:59.780 --> 07:02.348
councilman for the 13th District
of Los Angeles?

07:02.382 --> 07:03.916
The same councilman who voted no

07:03.950 --> 07:05.329
on the affordable housing bill?

07:05.363 --> 07:08.120
- This is illegal.
- Your guilt...

07:08.155 --> 07:09.655
has already been determined.

07:09.689 --> 07:12.625
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

07:12.659 --> 07:14.426
Give this man proper judgment.

07:16.396 --> 07:19.799
We gave you two chances
to change your ways,

07:19.833 --> 07:22.501
but corruption and greed still rule.

07:22.536 --> 07:24.637
So this time we don't want money

07:24.671 --> 07:26.539
and we don't want to bargain.

07:26.573 --> 07:28.974
We're going to burn the system down

07:29.009 --> 07:31.010
and rebuild on its ashes.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.685
Go! Go. Go.

07:46.673 --> 07:49.942
As I told LAPD Sergeant
Daniel Harrelson the last time,

07:49.967 --> 07:53.248
it's time to put faces to our beliefs.

07:56.169 --> 07:58.337
You know how optics work.

07:58.371 --> 08:00.339
The system we have is hopeless.

08:00.373 --> 08:02.074
That the average citizen is just fed

08:02.108 --> 08:04.310
lip service and lies.

08:04.344 --> 08:06.412
So, first, we came

08:06.446 --> 08:08.647
for the ruling class,
then the corporations.

08:08.682 --> 08:09.882
This time...

08:10.265 --> 08:11.984
it's the politicians.

08:12.559 --> 08:13.819
Every hour,

08:13.854 --> 08:17.323
we will sentence
another politician on air.

08:17.357 --> 08:19.158
You know they say that, uh,

08:19.192 --> 08:21.160
sequels are usually worse

08:21.194 --> 08:22.561
than the originals.

08:22.596 --> 08:23.945
They're correct.

08:25.398 --> 08:28.734
This will be much... much worse.

08:30.285 --> 08:32.203
Field Marshal Cinque...

08:32.537 --> 08:33.972
out.

08:38.879 --> 08:46.890
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:16.119 --> 09:17.538
Spoke to captain Cortez.

09:17.572 --> 09:19.758
Fortunately, no casualties
at the courthouse,

09:19.792 --> 09:22.888
but unis found Councilman
Strub's body hanging

09:22.889 --> 09:24.181
from the 4th Street Bridge.

09:24.216 --> 09:27.092
Similar to, uh, an immigrant
hanging from 100 years ago.

09:27.127 --> 09:28.794
These guys are history buffs.

09:28.828 --> 09:31.130
That's why they reenacted the
whole Patty Hearst thing before.

09:31.164 --> 09:32.531
It wouldn't surprise me

09:32.566 --> 09:33.961
if they were planning
this stunt all along.

09:33.961 --> 09:35.696
Patrol tried pressing
the Emancipators on trial,

09:35.737 --> 09:36.970
but to quote them,

09:37.004 --> 09:39.139
"We'd rather die than speak
against Field Marshal Cinque."

09:39.173 --> 09:40.840
Cinque's a man of his word.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.009
That means we're 30 minutes
from the top of the hour,

09:43.044 --> 09:44.477
and then he publicly executes

09:44.512 --> 09:46.379
Councilman Washington or Gwen Miller.

09:46.414 --> 09:48.782
Chief ordered a protection
detail on the mayor

09:48.816 --> 09:50.784
and every city council member
and their immediate families.

09:50.818 --> 09:52.485
All are potential targets.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.188
I want us ready to move as soon
as we identify this guy.

09:55.222 --> 09:57.724
Is there any particular reason
why he mentioned your name?

09:57.758 --> 09:59.359
You think you're a target, too?

09:59.393 --> 10:01.494
I doubt it. Cinque's just
playing games like last time.

10:01.529 --> 10:03.630
Well, he called your cell phone before.

10:03.664 --> 10:05.865
Street, I want us ready
to trace any new phone calls

10:05.900 --> 10:08.001
- or streaming signals these guys make.
- Roger that.

10:08.035 --> 10:10.036
We have the serial numbers of
the bank cash these guys stole.

10:10.071 --> 10:11.471
I can double check with other divisions,

10:11.505 --> 10:13.239
- track money on the street.
- Do it.

10:13.274 --> 10:17.677
Commander, I get your concern
for my safety, but I'm an asset.

10:17.712 --> 10:21.081
Cinque showed his face, knowing
that we would identify him.

10:21.115 --> 10:22.716
That makes him more dangerous than ever.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.150
He's got an endgame in mind,

10:24.185 --> 10:25.885
and we still don't know what it is yet.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.654
I can help stop it.

10:27.688 --> 10:29.503
The FBI got a bunch of calls
about Cinque.

10:29.537 --> 10:31.858
A lot of them say they recognize
him as Devin Carlisle.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.560
History major with radical leanings.

10:33.594 --> 10:35.161
Last known address?

10:35.196 --> 10:36.596
This house in the Valley.

10:36.630 --> 10:38.398
Things are never what it seem
with these guys

10:38.432 --> 10:39.999
- Tricks, traps...
- And bombs.

10:40.034 --> 10:41.668
We got to be careful.
Two times, they wanted us

10:41.702 --> 10:43.970
to storm the wrong place
and make us look bad.

10:50.411 --> 10:52.879
LAPD SWAT! Kids, stay put.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.048
Bedroom clear!

10:55.082 --> 10:56.282
- Closet only.
- Kitchen clear!

10:57.952 --> 11:00.019
Cleared the house, nothing here.

11:00.054 --> 11:01.421
Hey, guys.

11:01.455 --> 11:03.022
Guys. We're the police.

11:03.057 --> 11:04.624
We're not gonna hurt you. Are you okay?

11:04.658 --> 11:07.193
We're looking for a man
by the name of Cinque.

11:07.228 --> 11:08.595
Do you know who I'm talking about?

11:10.765 --> 11:12.766
He told us to give you this.

11:14.602 --> 11:16.770
"I was hoping you'd identify me

11:16.804 --> 11:18.371
"and find your way here. Good.

11:18.828 --> 11:20.140
"These are all homeless kids

11:20.174 --> 11:21.641
"we found sleeping on the street,

11:21.675 --> 11:22.909
"hungry and abandoned.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.694
"I gave them my house as a place to stay

11:24.729 --> 11:27.280
"after our so-called leaders
did nothing to help them.

11:27.314 --> 11:29.816
This is why politicians must pay."

11:29.850 --> 11:31.951
Signed "Cinque."

11:36.323 --> 11:38.291
Commander, this is Stacey,

11:38.325 --> 11:39.926
City Controller Gwen Miller's daughter.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.494
I know who she is. Thank you.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.130
The police picked me up,

11:44.165 --> 11:46.099
said I need to come here for protection.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.400
Those people have my mom.

11:47.435 --> 11:49.078
We're working very hard
to help your mother.

11:49.113 --> 11:50.737
The last time my mother and I were here,

11:50.771 --> 11:52.868
it was after you saved me.

11:52.903 --> 11:54.441
I remember. She was
very worried about you

11:54.475 --> 11:55.990
after that earthquake hit.

11:57.011 --> 11:58.912
My dad passed away a few years ago.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.948
His death kind of wrecked my mom.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.013
Oh. Yeah. I can understand that.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.915
Since then, it's just me and her.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.406
When was the last time
you spoke to your mom?

12:07.431 --> 12:10.487
This morning. She was headed to
brunch with those city councilmen.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.762
- Councilmen Strub and Washington?
- I-I think so.

12:12.796 --> 12:14.088
Do you know where they
were having brunch?

12:14.122 --> 12:16.279
Uh, the Pacific Dining Car near downtown.

12:16.313 --> 12:18.761
Okay. Listen, we're gonna do
everything we can to help your mother.

12:18.796 --> 12:20.630
But I'm gonna need you to
tell me everything you know

12:20.664 --> 12:22.499
- about that brunch.
- Commander,

12:22.533 --> 12:24.033
Cinque's streaming his next video.

12:24.068 --> 12:26.603
Okay. I need you to stay with her.

12:26.637 --> 12:28.771
Right over here, Councilman.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.810
Court's back in session.

12:33.844 --> 12:36.735
And on the docket:
Councilman Sumner Washington.

12:36.770 --> 12:38.777
Please, let me go.

12:38.811 --> 12:40.116
I'm innocent.

12:40.151 --> 12:42.185
Do you know why you
were elected to be in charge

12:42.220 --> 12:43.520
of the 8th District of Los Angeles?

12:44.018 --> 12:45.455
That's South L.A.

12:45.489 --> 12:47.490
Has a large ethnic minority population.

12:47.525 --> 12:48.892
Yet you were elected

12:48.926 --> 12:50.527
because of your hardline stance
as a judge.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.896
You perpetuated three-strike loopholes,

12:52.930 --> 12:55.624
putting away hundreds based
on unequal sentencing laws.

12:55.658 --> 12:57.567
Don't do this. Don't do this.

12:57.601 --> 12:58.968
Your guilt has already been determined.

12:59.003 --> 13:00.870
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.224
And your sentence...

13:04.533 --> 13:05.666
...throw him to the dogs.

13:06.602 --> 13:07.844
Don't do this!

13:07.878 --> 13:09.581
Tell us you tracked that.

13:09.616 --> 13:10.901
Working on it.

13:10.901 --> 13:12.815
Throw him to the dogs.
What does that mean?

13:12.883 --> 13:14.350
Earlier, I looked up Councilman
Washington's track record

13:14.385 --> 13:16.252
as a judge. He put away a lot of people.

13:16.287 --> 13:18.488
Specifically, he nearly
decimated Calle Doce Perros.

13:19.023 --> 13:20.891
12th Street Dogs. East Hollywood gang.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.726
Yeah. Me and Luca's
neighbor, uh, Marcos...

13:22.760 --> 13:24.361
he belongs to a rival set.

13:24.395 --> 13:26.063
So when Cinque says he's
throwing the councilman

13:26.097 --> 13:27.931
to the dogs, it means
he's tossing him to bangers

13:27.965 --> 13:29.461
that have revenge on their minds.

13:29.496 --> 13:32.129
Maybe Luca can talk to Marcos,
try to locate where they are.

13:32.163 --> 13:34.371
- Think your neighbor would help us?
- We got to try.

13:34.405 --> 13:36.540
Luca's earned some trust with him lately.

13:36.574 --> 13:39.676
I got a location on Cinque's
streaming feed. 600 Normandie.

13:39.711 --> 13:41.712
All right. Take Luca to talk to Marcos,

13:41.746 --> 13:43.895
hopefully we can still save
Councilman Washington.

13:43.929 --> 13:46.917
Get the rest of your team
and go grab Cinque.

13:47.351 --> 13:49.019
No windows.

13:49.053 --> 13:50.821
Matches the space from Cinque's feed.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.391
No heat signatures.

13:54.425 --> 13:56.893
Either no one's inside
or Cinque reinforced the walls.

13:57.653 --> 13:59.652
There's an external power source.

13:59.686 --> 14:01.783
Could be for automated machine
guns, like last time, Hondo.

14:01.818 --> 14:04.367
All right,
stay sharp. Bomb squad's on standby.

14:04.402 --> 14:05.602
Any signs of explosives, you back out.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.270
Roger that.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.171
Two, two, two, two, two.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.116
Cinque's not here.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.630
This is a server farm.

14:20.664 --> 14:23.620
He must be piggybacking the IP
address from another location.

14:31.796 --> 14:33.330
Luca, we got another dead end.

14:33.364 --> 14:34.731
I could really use something from you.

14:34.766 --> 14:36.299
Roger that, Hondo. We're on it.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.401
You sure the civvies
will make a difference?

14:38.436 --> 14:41.338
Look, we want info from Marcos,
I got to lower his defenses.

14:41.372 --> 14:43.273
He's not gonna want
to be seen with two guys

14:43.307 --> 14:44.941
in SWAT gear in broad daylight.

14:44.976 --> 14:46.119
Hey, Marcos.

14:46.790 --> 14:48.791
I got something I need
to discuss with you.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.116
Okay.

14:53.151 --> 14:54.544
You and me in the alley.

15:00.057 --> 15:01.591
Don't know about no councilman.

15:01.626 --> 15:03.260
But that Cinque dude?

15:03.294 --> 15:04.747
He makes a lot of sense, you ask me.

15:04.782 --> 15:06.463
Look, he's killing innocent people.

15:06.497 --> 15:07.577
Nobody in my family.

15:07.611 --> 15:09.266
You got nothing to lose telling me where

15:09.300 --> 15:10.667
the 12th Street Dogs are crewing up.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.269
They're a rival set.

15:12.303 --> 15:13.804
Yeah, but I ain't
no punk-ass snitch either.

15:13.838 --> 15:15.872
I'm not coming at you as the cop.

15:15.907 --> 15:18.175
I'm coming at you as the guy
who lives up the street.

15:19.443 --> 15:21.711
Look, I got respect for your abuela.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.232
She takes flowers to your
grandpa's grave every morning.

15:24.267 --> 15:26.449
- You watch my family?
- No, I watch the block.

15:26.484 --> 15:27.717
The same as you.

15:28.531 --> 15:30.153
And I heard your little brother,
Shorty, got popped

15:30.188 --> 15:31.655
with a grand theft.

15:31.689 --> 15:33.809
You help me find Councilman Washington,

15:33.843 --> 15:36.193
I get it reduced to a misdemeanor,

15:36.227 --> 15:37.694
take it off Shorty's record.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.729
Maybe he avoids the path that you took,

15:39.764 --> 15:41.799
makes your abuela proud.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.537
And don't ever talk about my family.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.972
That's how you catch smoke.

15:49.006 --> 15:50.674
Oh, whatever, man.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.242
Come on, Deac. Do me a favor,

15:52.276 --> 15:53.910
toss a mean look back at them.

15:55.019 --> 15:56.953
Marcos gave me where the
councilman's probably at.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.082
- Yeah?
- Yeah, just got to send

15:59.116 --> 16:00.717
an anonymous text to Metro,

16:00.751 --> 16:03.086
give Patrol credit for locating him.

16:05.056 --> 16:07.824
That way Marcos doesn't
look like a rat to his boys.

16:07.859 --> 16:10.427
Yeah. 22 David. We got a
location on the councilman.

16:10.461 --> 16:12.095
Inglewood Oil Fields.

16:41.492 --> 16:43.426
LAPD! On the ground!
Now, drop that weapon!

16:43.461 --> 16:44.899
- Get out of the car!
- Drop it!

16:44.933 --> 16:46.246
Down! Get down!

16:46.280 --> 16:48.398
Drop that weapon! Out of the car!

16:48.432 --> 16:50.333
- Hands where I can see them now!
- Drop to the ground!

16:51.102 --> 16:52.836
On the ground!

16:54.071 --> 16:55.305
On the ground!

16:57.475 --> 16:59.042
Hold on, we got you.

16:59.076 --> 17:00.461
You're okay now.

17:02.192 --> 17:06.590
*** leaders continues to terrorize
the city and surrounding areas.

17:06.872 --> 17:08.472
How's Councilman Washington?

17:08.507 --> 17:10.074
Doc says he'll be fine,

17:10.108 --> 17:12.710
but he had traces of
tranquilizer in his system.

17:12.743 --> 17:15.246
Cinque must've drugged him so
he wouldn't remember details.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.682
There anything that might get us
a location on the Emancipators?

17:17.715 --> 17:20.017
No. They could be anywhere...
five miles away or 50.

17:20.051 --> 17:22.520
Cinque thinks what he's doing is
the only way to change things.

17:22.554 --> 17:25.823
- Make people question if
what we do really matters.

17:25.857 --> 17:27.509
I've heard that before.

17:27.542 --> 17:28.949
You can't let him get under your skin.

17:28.983 --> 17:30.755
- He isn't.
- Well, someone is.

17:30.789 --> 17:32.827
It ain't Cinque, trust me.

17:34.527 --> 17:35.580
It's Darryl.

17:36.163 --> 17:37.935
This rehab thing's been a grind

17:37.969 --> 17:40.171
and it's been real tough
getting him out of his funk.

17:40.205 --> 17:41.405
Last time we spoke about this, you said

17:41.440 --> 17:42.921
you were in a funk of your own.

17:43.194 --> 17:44.828
You were gonna figure things out.

17:45.329 --> 17:46.562
Have you?

17:48.080 --> 17:49.914
I'm here if you want to talk.
You know that.

17:49.948 --> 17:51.949
I do.

17:52.608 --> 17:54.209
But I also heard a rumor
that you've been offered

17:54.234 --> 17:55.668
a chance to work with the feds.

17:55.933 --> 17:58.478
It's another undercover assignment.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.814
I'd be gone five or six weeks.

18:00.848 --> 18:02.749
What about that promotion here with LAPD?

18:02.783 --> 18:04.651
Well, the FBI's offer is a chance

18:04.685 --> 18:06.086
to do something different.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.922
It's hard watching others
do all the work.

18:08.956 --> 18:11.391
I miss being out in the middle of it all.

18:11.425 --> 18:14.510
- So I'm still considering it.
- I get it.

18:15.596 --> 18:17.246
If you do decide to take the job...

18:18.419 --> 18:19.986
would you tell me first?

18:21.848 --> 18:23.169
Of course.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.974
Another stream's up.

18:35.483 --> 18:37.584
Court is back in session.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.120
- Any bead on the signal?
- I'm getting hits from all over.

18:40.154 --> 18:42.455
They must be using relay
stations to mask the location.

18:45.659 --> 18:48.361
You are Gwen Miller?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.764
City controller of Los Angeles?

18:50.798 --> 18:52.599
Yes, I am.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.935
The same Gwen Miller
who slashed city budgets by 15%?

18:55.970 --> 18:57.170
The Gwen Miller

18:57.204 --> 18:58.872
who laid off city workers,

18:59.455 --> 19:01.174
closed homeless shelters,

19:01.208 --> 19:03.476
and killed after-school programs
for the children of Los Angeles?

19:03.511 --> 19:05.845
And you did this why... to save pennies

19:05.880 --> 19:07.380
for your corporate masters?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.182
I was doing my job.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.284
The city can't pay for everything.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.010
You think that's a defense?

19:13.821 --> 19:17.023
Please... I have a daughter.

19:17.057 --> 19:18.658
Now's not the time for pleading.

19:18.692 --> 19:20.894
This is merely
a sentencing hearing. This court

19:20.928 --> 19:22.495
has found you guilty
of being a politician

19:22.530 --> 19:24.105
who puts citizens last.

19:24.899 --> 19:26.299
Your sentence:

19:26.333 --> 19:27.969
death by firing squad.

19:28.009 --> 19:30.344
Like Councilmen Strub and Washington,

19:30.378 --> 19:32.680
you will be made an example.

19:34.683 --> 19:36.483
Are we any closer to finding them?

19:36.518 --> 19:39.987
We will be.
You guys heard what Cinque said.

19:40.021 --> 19:41.789
He thinks Councilman Washington is dead.

19:41.823 --> 19:43.657
He doesn't know that we saved him.

19:43.692 --> 19:45.459
What do you suggest we do
with that information?

19:45.493 --> 19:47.061
We keep him in the dark.

19:47.095 --> 19:48.562
Hold off on telling
the media... anyone...

19:48.596 --> 19:50.064
that we brought him back alive.

19:50.098 --> 19:51.699
The mayor's gonna need full disclosure,

19:51.733 --> 19:53.367
and so's the councilman's family.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.302
If Cinque finds out that we
saved Councilman Washington

19:55.337 --> 19:56.704
and screwed up his plans,

19:56.738 --> 19:59.039
he might just
kill Gwen Miller out of spite.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.141
Sir, this could be
the best chance we have

20:01.176 --> 20:03.310
of getting Gwen back to her daughter.

20:03.345 --> 20:05.479
That gives us 58 minutes,
we're gonna need every second.

20:05.513 --> 20:06.714
I'll hold off the press.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.248
Find this clown and do it fast.

20:08.283 --> 20:09.750
Hondo, we got something.

20:09.784 --> 20:11.652
I tracked the FBI's list
of serial numbers

20:11.686 --> 20:13.187
from bank cash the Emancipators stole.

20:13.221 --> 20:14.755
Olympic Division got a hit.

20:14.789 --> 20:16.857
They arrested a car thief
three days ago who had a stack

20:16.891 --> 20:18.192
of flagged $20 bills on him.

20:18.226 --> 20:19.560
Thief claimed he received them from a guy

20:19.594 --> 20:20.861
who fits Cinque's description.

20:20.895 --> 20:22.496
In exchange for a stolen moving truck.

20:22.530 --> 20:25.165
And now get this... we went
through security camera footage

20:25.200 --> 20:27.034
around the Pacific Dining Car,
where Gwen Miller

20:27.068 --> 20:28.702
and the councilmen
had brunch this morning.

20:28.737 --> 20:30.704
We thought it was a dead end
before we knew what to look for.

20:30.739 --> 20:32.006
That truck in the parking lot.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.273
The Emancipators probably used it

20:33.308 --> 20:35.009
to abduct the councilmen and Gwen Miller.

20:35.043 --> 20:37.344
Not only that, but the space
inside that truck is pretty big.

20:37.379 --> 20:39.079
Yeah, it's big enough
to hold a kangaroo court.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.614
Cinque's location is mobile.

20:40.648 --> 20:42.016
Which would explain
why they're piggybacking

20:42.050 --> 20:43.250
different IP addresses.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.718
Get a BOLO out on that truck.

20:44.753 --> 20:46.620
I want us tac'd up and ready to roll.

20:49.424 --> 20:52.099
20-David Squad,
suspect's truck has been spotted

20:52.133 --> 20:54.628
exiting the 5 Freeway to Castaic Dam.

21:13.181 --> 21:14.381
Good.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.403
Hands in the air!
Turn around! Turn around!

21:36.438 --> 21:38.030
Hands! Now!

21:48.316 --> 21:49.975
The automatic guns are about to go off.

21:50.010 --> 21:51.552
Take out the generator!

21:57.625 --> 21:58.859
Street!

22:00.295 --> 22:01.628
Hey, hey.

22:02.258 --> 22:03.858
It's okay.

22:03.883 --> 22:05.165
Hey, Gwen,

22:05.200 --> 22:06.221
I'm Officer Tan.

22:06.256 --> 22:07.401
You're gonna be okay.

22:10.839 --> 22:12.506
Cover!

22:25.587 --> 22:26.803
Cinque!

22:26.837 --> 22:29.061
They're coming for you from over here!

22:29.096 --> 22:30.958
Street, box him in.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.073
Hands! Show us your hands!

22:46.107 --> 22:47.541
Now!

22:53.615 --> 22:55.792
It's over, Cinque!

22:55.826 --> 22:57.943
Drop the gun! Put your hands in the air!

22:59.980 --> 23:01.081
Don't do it, man.

23:03.657 --> 23:05.190
Don't do what?

23:06.347 --> 23:08.948
He's unarmed!

23:17.193 --> 23:19.161
Hondo,

23:19.186 --> 23:21.187
he ditched his gun before.

23:25.637 --> 23:28.589
Unarmed black man shot by the LAPD.

23:29.751 --> 23:33.287
Thanks for helping the cause.

23:33.321 --> 23:35.422
You ain't about to be a martyr
on my watch.

23:41.095 --> 23:43.096
This is 20-David to Command.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.631
I need an R/A to location.

23:44.666 --> 23:45.799
Suspect down.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.785
Gunshot wound to his abdomen.

23:53.023 --> 23:55.357
Doctor says *** gonna have to clear out.

23:56.793 --> 23:58.795
Why don't I get a hospital room?

23:58.829 --> 24:00.542
You're too dangerous
to be around civilians.

24:00.576 --> 24:03.098
But feel free to enjoy
your stay with SWAT.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.001
I did what I set out to do.

24:06.036 --> 24:07.434
Did you?

24:07.469 --> 24:10.272
We saved Gwen Miller
and Councilman Washington.

24:10.307 --> 24:11.854
We got to him before the Dogs did.

24:11.889 --> 24:13.642
We did what we set out to do.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.951
We got Cinque chained to a bed in there.

24:21.985 --> 24:23.452
Why don't you look happy?

24:23.486 --> 24:25.221
Every Emancipator's been accounted for

24:25.255 --> 24:26.388
except one, sir.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.623
Rest of his cronies are in custody.

24:27.657 --> 24:29.225
That puts a serious crimp in their plans.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.259
Cinque is smart.

24:30.293 --> 24:31.627
This ain't his endgame.

24:31.661 --> 24:32.949
He's got to have something else cooking.

24:32.974 --> 24:34.341
Well, I hope to God you're wrong.

24:34.366 --> 24:36.166
I got to report to the mayor,
so keep digging.

24:39.773 --> 24:41.370
I looked over everything
we have on these guys.

24:41.404 --> 24:43.072
I don't see anything new.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.544
Everything these guys do is high-profile,

24:48.578 --> 24:51.313
for an audience.
Crime as performance art.

24:51.348 --> 24:52.815
What, do you think something's
going down at City Hall?

24:52.849 --> 24:54.750
This press conference
is a live broadcast.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.118
Who's attending it?

24:56.152 --> 24:59.054
Police brass, politicians,
city benefactors.

24:59.089 --> 25:00.774
Pillars of industry.

25:00.971 --> 25:02.438
Emancipator targets.

25:02.821 --> 25:05.594
Cinque's been planning all
of this for a while.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.329
Was there anything going on at City Hall

25:07.364 --> 25:09.064
- in the last year?
- Let me see.

25:09.099 --> 25:11.233
Here's something. They installed
new security cameras

25:11.268 --> 25:12.901
four months ago,
and the installation crew had

25:12.936 --> 25:14.903
to scan IDs to gain access
to the building.

25:14.938 --> 25:17.906
That work crew... sure looks
like our Emancipators on trial.

25:17.941 --> 25:19.575
They used the installation job

25:19.609 --> 25:21.410
to plant explosives inside City Hall.

25:21.444 --> 25:22.811
Cinque likes an audience.

25:22.846 --> 25:24.647
Now he's got one on live TV.

25:27.851 --> 25:29.752
City Councilman Sumner Washington

25:29.786 --> 25:31.453
is in serious but stable condition

25:31.488 --> 25:33.455
at Inglewood Hospital,
while City Controller

25:33.490 --> 25:34.757
Gwen Miller...

25:34.791 --> 25:36.425
standing with us...

25:36.459 --> 25:39.595
has been reunited with her
family and is doing well.

25:40.730 --> 25:42.197
We have full confidence

25:42.232 --> 25:44.133
that the group known
as the Emancipators...

25:44.167 --> 25:45.614
- Hondo?
- Captain,

25:45.648 --> 25:47.670
the Emancipators plan
on blowing up City Hall on air.

25:47.704 --> 25:49.305
We need everybody out of there now.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.472
Roger that.

25:50.741 --> 25:52.541
And that means you, too.

25:52.575 --> 25:55.177
...has been detained and
is currently in police custody

25:55.211 --> 25:57.313
at the LAPD's Metropolitan Division.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.281
- Excuse me, Chief.
- One moment, please.

25:59.316 --> 26:01.317
There's been a change of plans.

26:05.221 --> 26:06.388
We took out the cell towers,

26:06.423 --> 26:08.190
but they might have planned
for that this time.

26:08.224 --> 26:10.492
- Could be using infrared detonation.
- That gives him the option

26:10.527 --> 26:11.931
of being close enough to confirm success.

26:11.966 --> 26:13.522
Yeah, that means
he'll need line of sight.

26:13.556 --> 26:15.030
Dispatch got a call from a security guard

26:15.065 --> 26:16.398
at Vyrillian Dynamics.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.133
Suspicious activity on the top floor.

26:18.168 --> 26:20.469
That building's
one block south of City Hall.

26:20.503 --> 26:21.503
The whole floor's being renovated.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.871
Nothing but rebar and Visqueen.

26:22.906 --> 26:24.073
Empty floor with no obstructions.

26:24.107 --> 26:25.441
Best line of sight he'll get.

26:36.119 --> 26:37.829
Nice and calm. Quickly.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.504
Go! Get out!

27:05.915 --> 27:07.282
Street and Tan, you're with me.

27:07.317 --> 27:09.251
Evac starts on the ground floor,
shallow to deep.

27:09.285 --> 27:11.920
Deacon, Luca, Chris, go find that bomber.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.693
Cortez is inside clearing civilians!

27:17.727 --> 27:19.194
Street, take the two-side.

27:19.229 --> 27:20.629
Tan, take the four.

27:21.437 --> 27:22.704
Go!

27:22.729 --> 27:24.964
Come on! Come on.

27:27.628 --> 27:30.340
Go. Go. Go.

27:34.477 --> 27:36.612
20-David to Cortez, do you read me?

27:43.520 --> 27:45.053
LAPD!

27:45.088 --> 27:46.288
- Show me your hands!
- Hey!

27:47.203 --> 27:48.253
Go.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.633
Lights.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.636
Chris.

28:15.352 --> 28:17.720
Two o'clock! West stairwell! In pursuit!

28:19.809 --> 28:21.309
Captain!

28:21.991 --> 28:23.192
Captain!

28:24.269 --> 28:25.437
Captain.

28:30.526 --> 28:31.726
Captain.

28:32.110 --> 28:33.802
Jessica.

28:33.837 --> 28:34.870
Come on. Jessica.

29:15.104 --> 29:16.238
I got him!

29:48.871 --> 29:50.605
Chris, you good?

29:51.707 --> 29:52.908
Better than good.

29:52.942 --> 29:54.943
22-David, Chris got the bomber.

29:54.977 --> 29:56.077
30-David to D-Team.

29:56.112 --> 29:57.282
Status.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.702
26-David, clear.

29:58.737 --> 30:00.365
25-David, clear.

30:04.145 --> 30:05.453
Hondo?

30:26.309 --> 30:28.393
20-David, all clear.

30:36.557 --> 30:37.791
Vital signs are normal.

30:37.816 --> 30:38.849
I think she's got a concussion.

30:38.874 --> 30:40.322
We got her.

31:06.556 --> 31:08.950
I guess the show wasn't over, was it?

31:10.045 --> 31:11.312
I can see you're disappointed.

31:13.271 --> 31:14.823
You know, you're not the only one

31:14.857 --> 31:16.691
who likes to deliver surprises.

31:23.032 --> 31:25.367
You did a lot of damage...

31:25.742 --> 31:27.369
to a building.

31:27.403 --> 31:28.745
City Hall.

31:28.770 --> 31:30.471
And there was no loss of life.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.916
We figured out what you were up to.

31:39.715 --> 31:41.616
Okay. Hmm.

31:41.925 --> 31:43.969
Game recognizes game.

31:45.095 --> 31:46.655
Doesn't matter.

31:46.689 --> 31:48.371
My group will inspire others.

31:48.405 --> 31:50.492
No, we'll be right here
to stop them every time.

31:51.674 --> 31:53.675
You think the status quo will work?

31:54.187 --> 31:55.864
That small changes matter?

31:56.356 --> 31:58.240
What's changed since the
last time you and me talked?

31:58.274 --> 31:59.801
We're done talking.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.820
I see the anger in you, brother.

32:07.242 --> 32:11.079
Yeah, I had anger, but I didn't
let it drive me to do wrong.

32:11.496 --> 32:14.207
I know change is possible,
because you're looking at it...

32:16.330 --> 32:17.752
brother.

32:30.733 --> 32:32.167
Hey.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.435
Hey.

32:35.395 --> 32:36.938
How was work?

32:37.772 --> 32:39.232
It was good.

32:39.942 --> 32:41.418
How you feeling, Mom?

32:41.453 --> 32:43.445
My headache's cleared away, so...

32:45.881 --> 32:48.483
Thank you so much
for coming and getting me.

32:52.996 --> 32:54.289
You okay?

32:56.225 --> 32:57.759
Um...

32:59.228 --> 33:00.762
I'm so sorry...

33:00.796 --> 33:03.098
Jimmy, that you had to see me like that.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.509
Sometimes your mom's just pretty sick.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.909
Mrs. Street,

33:14.944 --> 33:16.484
I have to remand you back
into state custody

33:16.518 --> 33:17.912
for parole violations. You missed several

33:17.947 --> 33:19.280
check-in appointments and were found

33:19.315 --> 33:20.315
under the influence

33:20.349 --> 33:21.723
- of narcotics.
- You reported me?

33:21.757 --> 33:23.838
So that you can get
treatment, get better.

33:23.872 --> 33:25.420
I can't go back to jail.

33:25.454 --> 33:26.636
Oh, my God, Jimmy,

33:26.670 --> 33:29.235
I can't go back to prison.
Jimmy, I can't go back.

33:29.270 --> 33:32.127
I can't. After all I've been
through and all I've done

33:32.161 --> 33:33.762
for you, you're sending me back?

33:33.796 --> 33:35.096
We've got no alternative now.

33:35.131 --> 33:36.331
They'll reinstate you for one year,

33:36.365 --> 33:37.904
then the parole board will reevaluate.

33:37.939 --> 33:40.854
What kind of son
would do this to his mother?

33:40.889 --> 33:42.971
The kind that doesn't want you to die.

34:01.857 --> 34:03.925
Darryl's being released
from the hospital.

34:03.959 --> 34:06.444
He's gonna walk with a limp,
but he's gonna be okay.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.815
Leroy, I know he's your son,

34:11.841 --> 34:13.451
and I am not his father,

34:14.167 --> 34:17.101
but me and my moms are gonna be
looking after him now full-time.

34:17.127 --> 34:19.562
I got nothing but love
for your moms, Hondo,

34:19.809 --> 34:22.677
but Darryl needs more
than just looking after.

34:27.255 --> 34:28.290
I know that.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.715
Do you?

34:29.739 --> 34:31.541
'Cause you're always trying
to save people.

34:32.512 --> 34:34.121
How'd that work with me?

34:35.098 --> 34:36.683
I know you, dawg.

34:37.219 --> 34:39.853
Ever since Big Darryl got killed
and I went away,

34:40.520 --> 34:42.664
you've been trying to make things right

34:42.697 --> 34:43.998
for everybody in the world.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.635
When I lost you and Big Darryl,

34:47.659 --> 34:50.027
I lost every friend I ever trusted,

34:50.053 --> 34:51.954
and that left me to fight alone.

34:53.032 --> 34:55.743
Truth is, I've been fighting...

34:56.779 --> 34:58.329
and failing.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.785
And maybe that's just
the way it's gonna be.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.714
Coming up the way we did,

35:08.113 --> 35:10.014
you want to make things better.

35:12.261 --> 35:14.763
Don't mean you got to be
everybody's savior.

35:15.305 --> 35:17.899
I just want to do right by Darryl.

35:17.933 --> 35:20.468
And you want my blessing.

35:24.063 --> 35:26.307
You're good for my son.

35:31.413 --> 35:33.531
Maybe he's even better for you.

35:45.761 --> 35:47.629
Show him what he ain't seen.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.801
Show him what's possible.

36:05.701 --> 36:07.335
You need to wipe
that smile off your face.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.860
You have way too much fun
at these things.

36:08.885 --> 36:10.752
Maybe I enjoy having my daughter here.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.420
You ever think of that?

36:12.454 --> 36:16.391
So, you want to know
the real reason I'm in L.A.?

36:16.425 --> 36:18.927
- I interviewed for a job.
- What?

36:18.961 --> 36:20.395
I found out this morning that I got it.

36:20.429 --> 36:21.396
Well, why didn't you tell me?

36:21.430 --> 36:22.897
I didn't want to jinx it.

36:22.932 --> 36:24.833
Or get your hopes up that
I'd be moving back to L.A.

36:24.867 --> 36:25.917
until it was certain.

36:28.627 --> 36:30.595
That smile's stuck on you now.

36:32.674 --> 36:33.821
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:33.856 --> 36:35.981
- Long time, no see.
- Yeah, yeah, how you been?

36:36.016 --> 36:37.428
- Good.
- Yeah?

36:39.708 --> 36:41.909
And now it is with great pleasure

36:42.218 --> 36:46.254
that I award the final honor
of the Police Star

36:46.288 --> 36:49.791
to 20 Squad member Sergeant David Kay.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.795
Deac!

36:53.829 --> 36:55.029
Congratulations, Sergeant.

36:55.064 --> 36:56.030
Thank you.

36:56.065 --> 36:57.740
Commander.

36:59.006 --> 37:00.340
Deacon!

37:01.403 --> 37:03.329
Yeah!

37:08.677 --> 37:11.671
Uh, thank you, Chief Rivera.

37:13.261 --> 37:17.064
I'd also like to thank
my wife Annie and my kids,

37:17.089 --> 37:18.890
who were gonna be here today,
until one of them got

37:18.915 --> 37:21.550
strep throat and gave it to another one,

37:21.575 --> 37:23.175
and now Annie's at the pediatrician

37:23.200 --> 37:25.634
with all three of them... four of them.

37:26.851 --> 37:28.438
So who's the real hero in my family?

37:30.933 --> 37:34.068
And to 20 Squad
for always having my back.

37:34.549 --> 37:36.917
It's an honor to receive the Police Star.

37:36.942 --> 37:38.342
It's an honor to wear the badge.

37:38.367 --> 37:40.050
All I had to do to earn this award

37:40.075 --> 37:42.677
was sacrifice my third lumbar.

37:50.971 --> 37:52.772
The-the truth is, um...

37:54.075 --> 37:55.715
I don't deserve this award.

37:56.635 --> 37:57.800
My team does.

37:58.233 --> 38:01.269
They do extraordinary things
every single day.

38:01.797 --> 38:03.264
Like Chris Alonzo...

38:03.723 --> 38:05.166
Yeah. ...risking her life

38:05.200 --> 38:07.268
to take down a suspect to save others.

38:07.303 --> 38:11.239
Jim Street volunteered to go
into a booby-trapped space.

38:11.273 --> 38:13.374
Victor Tan... he would have gone first

38:13.409 --> 38:15.710
if he hadn't lost
at rock, paper, scissors.

38:15.744 --> 38:17.412
And Dominique Luca,

38:17.446 --> 38:19.881
he's got a gift
of human connection that's...

38:19.915 --> 38:20.982
it's amazing to see.

38:22.651 --> 38:25.286
And Daniel Harrelson, Hondo,

38:25.595 --> 38:27.288
with your leadership...

38:28.557 --> 38:29.791
we're more than a team.

38:29.825 --> 38:31.826
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.728
This award, it's-it's not mine.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.967
It's for all you who have blessed me.

38:40.803 --> 38:42.629
Thank you, and God bless.

38:47.473 --> 38:48.876
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations.

38:48.911 --> 38:50.386
You must be pretty good, too.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.146
Well, you know, we're SWAT.

38:54.392 --> 38:57.318
- I meant at rock, paper, scissors.
- Yes.

38:57.353 --> 38:59.681
I am excellent at rock,
paper, scissors, actually.

38:59.716 --> 39:02.256
And tic-tac-toe. Mm-hmm.

39:02.291 --> 39:03.658
Yeah.

39:05.094 --> 39:07.729
Deac, I'm so happy for you, man.

39:07.763 --> 39:11.040
Actually, I got a present for you.

39:11.366 --> 39:13.067
First installment of the loan payment.

39:13.092 --> 39:14.359
It helped more than you know.

39:14.669 --> 39:15.903
Thanks, man.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.296
Congrats.

39:17.639 --> 39:18.881
- Thank you again, Chief.
- Yeah.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.845
So, how'd it feel to be
in the middle of it all?

39:23.879 --> 39:26.114
- It's never dull.
- Hmm.

39:27.014 --> 39:29.183
You wanted me to tell you first.

39:30.866 --> 39:32.533
I'm gonna take the FBI up on their offer

39:32.558 --> 39:33.691
and do the five weeks.

39:36.158 --> 39:38.126
Just five weeks, huh?

39:38.160 --> 39:42.263
Well, you know me. We'll see.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.900
Yeah. Just do me a favor.

39:47.529 --> 39:49.096
Take care of yourself out there.

40:08.257 --> 40:10.475
I've never been to the beach before.

40:11.927 --> 40:14.270
It took me a few years, too, Darryl.

40:14.863 --> 40:17.365
Even though I grew up
only 15 minutes away.

40:20.067 --> 40:21.536
It looks like a painting.

40:22.069 --> 40:23.446
Yeah.

40:24.373 --> 40:25.673
So, how long can we stay here?

40:25.698 --> 40:26.824
As long as you want.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.545
I cashed in 64 days of vacation time

40:30.579 --> 40:32.038
that I put together over the years.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.001
I thought maybe you and I could
do some traveling this summer.

40:35.583 --> 40:36.875
You took off work?

40:36.905 --> 40:38.085
I did.

40:38.833 --> 40:40.434
I'll never be able to repay my mother

40:40.459 --> 40:41.839
for what she is for me,

40:42.891 --> 40:45.026
but maybe I can pay it forward with you.

40:50.232 --> 40:51.641
Thank you.

41:01.108 --> 41:02.343
Hey, you okay?

41:02.377 --> 41:03.711
Yeah, yeah.

41:03.745 --> 41:05.071
I got you.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.327
So, where are we going?

41:21.830 --> 41:23.297
Where do you want to go?

41:25.234 --> 41:28.169
I mean, I never seen a kangaroo before.

41:31.145 --> 41:32.598
Me neither.
