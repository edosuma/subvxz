Albert Einstein

problems with the same

00:47.944 --> 00:51.189
We have to expand our
world to learn new things.

00:51.223 --> 00:53.225
I'm not where I am because I'm
a product of my environment,

00:53.260 --> 00:56.263
because my environment
didn't make me.

00:56.297 --> 00:58.092
My choices did.

00:58.127 --> 01:01.820
And I take responsibility
for every single one of them,

01:01.854 --> 01:05.306
because our pasts shouldn't
determine our futures, right?

Baby?

02:28.941 --> 02:30.322
Hello.

02:30.357 --> 02:32.013
They're about
to take Kevin in to surgery.

02:32.048 --> 02:34.464
Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:34.499 --> 02:36.466
They're taking him
into surgery right now?

02:36.501 --> 02:38.296
Yeah, but.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.160
I don't want you to come by yet.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.471
What,
what are they saying?

02:41.506 --> 02:42.817
They're
saying one of the bullets

02:42.852 --> 02:44.267
is still lodged in him.

02:44.302 --> 02:44.992
Oh.

02:46.131 --> 02:47.788
He has, he has a
bullet lodged in him.

02:47.822 --> 02:49.790
Yeah, they're
saying two guys drove up

02:49.824 --> 02:52.379
next to him at a light
and started shooting.

02:52.413 --> 02:53.966
Babe,
can you call me back

02:54.001 --> 02:55.761
as soon as he gets
out of surgery?

02:55.796 --> 02:57.487
Okay.
He may be.

02:57.522 --> 02:59.386
Okay.
All right, I love you.

02:59.420 --> 03:00.732
I love you too.

03:03.286 --> 03:04.736
What's going on?

03:06.841 --> 03:08.878
She said two people

03:10.190 --> 03:12.640
pulled up next to him at a
light and started shooting.

03:12.675 --> 03:15.402
Said he tried to get over
into the passenger's side,

03:15.436 --> 03:17.404
and got shot twice.

03:17.438 --> 03:18.474
So what you gonna do?

03:18.508 --> 03:20.130
What you mean,
what am I gonna do-

03:20.165 --> 03:23.341
What you gonna do, man,
what you mean what I mean?

03:23.375 --> 03:25.205
They done shot your homeboy.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.137
I think we just need to
let God deal with this, man-

03:27.172 --> 03:29.243
Let God deal with it?

03:29.278 --> 03:31.349
I'm tired of you
and this praying.

03:31.383 --> 03:33.040
You pray, pray,
pray, and you broke.

03:33.074 --> 03:34.455
So what you wanna do, you
wanna just go roll up on 'em?

03:34.490 --> 03:36.871
You praying, and your
homeboy in critical condition,

03:36.906 --> 03:38.390
right now.

03:38.425 --> 03:40.841
Have you forgot where we from?

03:40.875 --> 03:42.014
Huh?

03:42.049 --> 03:43.361
We don't pray.

03:43.395 --> 03:46.640
We send him to God and
let him deal with it.

03:49.194 --> 03:50.126
So what you gonna do?

04:04.830 --> 04:05.624
Nah.

04:32.410 --> 04:33.307
What happened?

04:33.342 --> 04:35.447
Well, you know Jonah Smith?

04:35.482 --> 04:37.104
Yeah, from church.

04:37.138 --> 04:38.381
Yeah, he came into the ER

04:38.416 --> 04:40.349
last Tuesday with
cardiac arrest.

04:40.383 --> 04:41.764
You're kidding.

04:41.798 --> 04:43.421
Who is Jonah Smith?

04:43.455 --> 04:45.043
Yes, you do know him.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.287
He sits in the second row
right behind where you guys-

04:47.321 --> 04:48.736
His kids are in
Sabrina's class.

04:48.771 --> 04:50.324
Oh my gosh, yes.

04:50.359 --> 04:54.328
Yeah, I had to call her.
I had to call his wife.

04:54.363 --> 04:55.674
He didn't make it.

04:55.709 --> 04:57.331
Are you serious?

04:57.366 --> 04:58.712
Yeah.

04:58.746 --> 05:01.128
That conversation, not
one of my better moments.

05:01.162 --> 05:02.129
I'm sure.

05:02.163 --> 05:05.270
Such a preventable disease.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.410
Nice sneakers, Marquise.

05:07.445 --> 05:10.068
Thanks, I got 'em
for my birthday.

05:10.102 --> 05:13.278
Hmm, are they water resistant?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.797
Hey.

05:14.831 --> 05:17.627
So, can I play?

05:17.662 --> 05:19.215
I don't know if I should,

05:19.249 --> 05:20.906
you was about to pour
water on my new sneakers.

05:20.941 --> 05:23.426
I was just joking.

05:23.461 --> 05:25.290
Please.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.878
Here.

05:26.912 --> 05:28.155
You have to show
me how to play.

05:28.189 --> 05:29.570
So therefore take up
the whole armor of God

05:29.605 --> 05:30.882
And you will be able to
withstand the evil today,

05:30.916 --> 05:32.470
and having done,
all to stand firm.

05:32.504 --> 05:35.058
That's straight from the
Bible guys, Ephesians 6:13.

05:35.093 --> 05:37.751
We have a real battle going
on in our everyday life.

05:37.785 --> 05:40.305
Hey. You just got me killed.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.858
You don't need
these things anyway,

05:41.893 --> 05:43.619
they taint the mind and strain
us from our righteous path.

05:43.653 --> 05:46.346
Would you do us the
honor of blessing the food?

05:46.380 --> 05:47.139
I'd love to.

05:47.174 --> 05:48.037
All right.

05:48.071 --> 05:49.970
Everyone bow your heads.

05:50.004 --> 05:52.421
Dear Lord, thank
you for this meal

05:52.455 --> 05:54.284
that we are about to receive.

05:54.319 --> 05:57.357
I ask that you watch
over our children,

05:57.391 --> 06:00.325
and protect them as they
go out into the world,

06:00.360 --> 06:03.535
at school, or otherwise.

06:03.570 --> 06:06.158
In your name I pray, amen.

06:06.193 --> 06:07.505
Amen, amen.

06:07.539 --> 06:10.508
Can somebody please pass
me that bread on down here?

06:13.994 --> 06:14.995
I'm waiting, I'm waiting,
I'm waiting, come on.

06:15.029 --> 06:18.205
Patience is a virtue Pastor

06:18.239 --> 06:19.655
It's coming, it's coming.

06:19.689 --> 06:21.311
There we go.

06:21.346 --> 06:22.899
Would you like some, sister?

06:22.934 --> 06:25.108
That's okay, I'm good.

06:25.143 --> 06:27.594
Okay, yes love,
thank you very much.

06:31.287 --> 06:33.841
That's what I
want right there.

06:33.876 --> 06:35.740
Thank you, yes.

06:36.706 --> 06:38.087
It's time to get to work.

06:41.435 --> 06:42.678
Are you all right?

06:42.712 --> 06:44.162
Are you okay?

06:44.196 --> 06:45.370
I'm fine.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.648
Just feeling a
little lightheaded.

06:47.683 --> 06:49.443
Baby, can you get me
some water please?

06:49.478 --> 06:51.514
Are you good?

06:51.549 --> 06:53.827
I just need some water.

07:01.282 --> 07:02.905
Easy, easy.

07:05.804 --> 07:07.461
Better?

07:07.496 --> 07:11.465
I'm fine, I just think I
need to go to the restroom,

07:11.500 --> 07:12.673
if you'll excuse me.

07:14.261 --> 07:16.539
No, I'm good.

07:16.574 --> 07:19.542
I'll, I'll be right back.

07:19.577 --> 07:21.371
Okay.

07:21.406 --> 07:22.545
Oh, Sabrina!

07:22.580 --> 07:23.443
Call 911!

07:24.754 --> 07:28.586
Sister Williams,
are you okay, Sister Williams?

07:28.620 --> 07:30.070
Oh my god.

07:30.104 --> 07:33.038
Alright,
you're good, you're fine.

07:35.524 --> 07:36.870
Sabrina, Sabrina?

07:39.700 --> 07:41.495
Where's the ambulance?

08:03.655 --> 08:05.139
Oh my goodness.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.246
This girl gonna kill me.

08:15.564 --> 08:19.740
Okay.

08:21.604 --> 08:22.432
Ah.

08:25.988 --> 08:30.958
So, being that you wanted to
talk, I actually had something

08:32.822 --> 08:36.550
that I wanted to tell you
too, something that was on

08:36.585 --> 08:38.138
my mind.

08:38.172 --> 08:39.588
This should be interesting.

08:40.899 --> 08:45.283
Well, we haven't talked
about this in a while, but.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.079
What's all that?

08:48.113 --> 08:49.839
I already know
what this is about.

08:49.874 --> 08:52.048
Okay, so tell me what it's
about then, since you know.

08:52.083 --> 08:55.707
You don't know how much
longer you can go without me

08:55.742 --> 08:57.364
giving myself to you.

09:00.401 --> 09:01.264
You're funny.

09:01.299 --> 09:02.403
I know you like a book.

09:04.613 --> 09:06.718
No, but seriously, I want
you to think about this

09:06.753 --> 09:08.548
from my perspective
though, alright.

09:10.032 --> 09:14.139
For real, for real, we've
known each other forever.

09:14.174 --> 09:18.454
We've been together for like
over two years, and nothing.

09:18.488 --> 09:22.562
Babe, I want to experience
us taking our relationship

09:22.596 --> 09:24.080
to a new level.

09:24.115 --> 09:25.495
You know what I mean?

09:25.530 --> 09:26.220
But physically.

09:30.397 --> 09:32.502
Just forget I even
brought it for now though.

09:32.537 --> 09:34.712
Maybe we can talk about it
another time. It's whatever.

09:34.746 --> 09:35.436
Okay.

09:36.990 --> 09:37.887
Okay what?

09:37.922 --> 09:39.682
I'll think about it.

09:39.717 --> 09:41.063
Like for real.

09:41.097 --> 09:42.582
Yeah.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.342
No, like for real, for real.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.171
Yes, I will think about it.

09:47.725 --> 09:50.728
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about babe.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.626
Don't get so excited please.

09:52.661 --> 09:54.352
What do you mean
don't get excited?

09:54.386 --> 09:55.491
I didn't say yes, so.

09:55.525 --> 09:56.734
Okay, but it's a step.

09:56.768 --> 09:58.874
You know what I
mean, it's a process.

09:58.908 --> 10:00.461
I guess.

10:00.496 --> 10:01.739
It's not like I'm trying
to rush you into this.

10:01.773 --> 10:02.671
Really.

10:02.705 --> 10:04.017
I'm not.

10:04.051 --> 10:05.674
Like I said, we've been
together for over two years.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.676
Okay, so why aren't
we getting married?

10:07.710 --> 10:10.817
Pablo, Pablo.

10:12.197 --> 10:13.992
Bruh, ya'll missing

10:24.727 --> 10:25.625
Oh yeah.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.556
Babe.

10:26.591 --> 10:27.765
What's wrong with you man?

10:27.799 --> 10:28.973
It's not even worth
it okay, just go.

10:29.007 --> 10:30.250
Hey, you better listen

Hey, it's a problem?

whisper, that's for females.

11:06.735 --> 11:09.151

11:34.901 --> 11:35.902
What's good?

11:35.936 --> 11:37.213
What's
good with you, fam?

11:37.248 --> 11:38.559
You see me man, what's
happening with you man?

11:38.594 --> 11:39.871
Just chillin' man,
chasing this paper.

11:39.906 --> 11:40.665
Where you at?

11:42.218 --> 11:44.082
Nine to five, man.

11:44.117 --> 11:46.291
You still working for the man?

11:46.326 --> 11:48.777
Bro, my bills
ain't gonna pay themselves.

11:48.811 --> 11:52.297
What you making,
14, 15 an hour?

11:52.332 --> 11:53.816
I don't want to tell
you now, you're over here

11:53.851 --> 11:55.473
throwing out these numbers.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.854
What you making, 20?

11:56.888 --> 12:00.236
Let me stop you right
there. Started off at nine.

12:00.271 --> 12:00.927
Nine?

12:02.514 --> 12:03.308
Shh, nine?

12:04.551 --> 12:06.967
Yes, nine.

12:07.002 --> 12:10.695
Bird, grab that bag.
Grab the little bag.

12:11.972 --> 12:12.835
Here you go.

12:14.561 --> 12:16.528
Nine of these an hour.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.118
See, you don't listen, playboy.

12:20.153 --> 12:22.707
See, you'd rather put in
work for everybody else

12:22.742 --> 12:25.710
to help them build their
business, when you can be right

12:25.745 --> 12:28.989
here with us getting this
bread, building our business.

12:29.024 --> 12:30.784
What you have to do
to get that though?

12:30.819 --> 12:31.820
No risk, no reward.

12:31.854 --> 12:33.166
Alright, now look.

12:34.684 --> 12:37.342
Let me just get going,
'cause I'm about to be late.

12:38.688 --> 12:41.484
It look good though, I
ain't gonna lie to you.

12:41.519 --> 12:43.486
I would like to see
that in my hand.

12:43.521 --> 12:45.316
We gonna talk, alright.

13:13.344 --> 13:16.554
Hey, boss, I'm sorry I was
late, my car was giving-

13:16.588 --> 13:17.866
I don't want to hear it.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.420
Just get to work and see
me when your shift ends.

13:20.454 --> 13:21.386
Seriously.

13:21.421 --> 13:22.905
I said I don't
want to hear it.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.218
Now, everyone back to
work, this ain't a show.

13:28.014 --> 13:29.809
Watch it boss,
watch your step,

13:29.843 --> 13:32.087
boss, blood pressure
gonna go up, boss.

13:32.121 --> 13:33.571
Take it easy.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.884
That wasn't even necessary.

13:35.918 --> 13:38.783
Al, what the heck
you looking at man?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.543
Dead man walking.

13:42.097 --> 13:43.753
Dead man walking.

13:44.754 --> 13:46.860
Dead man walking.

13:46.895 --> 13:47.757
That's funny huh?

13:48.966 --> 13:50.899
Need to come to
work on time, bud.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.491
So how much you made so far?

13:57.526 --> 13:59.735
How much you think we made?

13:59.769 --> 14:00.978
I don't know, man.

14:01.012 --> 14:01.668
$125.

14:02.980 --> 14:05.914
You know what's up,
I know what's up.

14:05.948 --> 14:08.192
D-Rock is making all the money.

14:08.226 --> 14:09.918
There ain't nothing
we can do about it.

14:09.952 --> 14:11.402
Unless you want to bump
heads with him, you feel me.

14:11.436 --> 14:14.439
There's always something
we can do about it.

14:14.474 --> 14:16.959
Mastermind, I'm a cook a plan.

14:16.994 --> 14:18.236
So let's get to work.

14:20.342 --> 14:21.930
Where are you going?

14:21.964 --> 14:24.311
I've got things
I've got to do, okay.

14:24.346 --> 14:26.831
Are you gonna give me
money for the furniture?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.178
You gonna make some
money for the furniture?

14:29.213 --> 14:31.940
Furniture right there, sit down.

14:31.974 --> 14:33.700
Happy birthday.

15:50.052 --> 15:52.054
Did we raise farm animals?

15:53.849 --> 15:55.471
Tiffany!

15:55.506 --> 15:57.646
Be nice. At least
she's doing her homework.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.061
I'm gonna be nice alright.

15:59.096 --> 15:59.993
Tiffany!

16:01.098 --> 16:02.547
Im a get Dinner started.

16:03.686 --> 16:06.862
I know you didn't
leave this mess in here.

16:07.863 --> 16:10.038
Tiffany, don't make
me come in there.

16:13.075 --> 16:14.007
What?

16:14.042 --> 16:15.388
What do you mean what?

16:15.422 --> 16:16.941
Who do you think
you're talking to?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.047
Why is my living room so messy?

16:19.081 --> 16:21.049
Did you leave this mess in here?

16:21.083 --> 16:22.188
Really?

16:23.603 --> 16:27.020
I don't know dad, maybe
somebody broke in, had a snack,

16:27.055 --> 16:30.023
and decided to do
my homework for me.

16:30.058 --> 16:34.131
Maybe Goldilocks is a college
student and thought my

16:34.165 --> 16:35.270
studies would be just right.

16:35.304 --> 16:36.857
Don't you sass me young lady.

16:36.892 --> 16:38.998
You know, I asked your
brother to stop by the store

16:39.032 --> 16:40.689
and pick up a few things
after Bible study.

16:40.723 --> 16:42.035
Did he stop in yet?

16:42.070 --> 16:43.623
Do you know who else
needs to attend Bible study

16:43.657 --> 16:45.935
so that they can review
the commandment on how to

16:45.970 --> 16:47.661
honor their mother and
father, so that their days

16:47.696 --> 16:49.077
may be long on the earth?

16:49.111 --> 16:51.286
That commandment is
definitely for parents

16:51.320 --> 16:52.459
who actually deserve it.

16:52.494 --> 16:53.253
Tiffany.

16:53.288 --> 16:54.703
Excuse me?

16:54.737 --> 16:56.567
That's enough.
Apologize to your father.

16:56.601 --> 16:59.915
No, Mom. I'm so sick of
his self-righteous bull.

17:04.471 --> 17:06.370
You better get your child.

17:07.302 --> 17:08.337
Who is it?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.134
It's Marquise.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.449
Hello, Mrs. Evans.

17:16.483 --> 17:18.347
Hey, Marquise.

17:20.936 --> 17:22.213
Pastor Evans.

17:23.904 --> 17:25.113
Marquise.

17:25.147 --> 17:26.597
I thought
I would stop by

17:26.631 --> 17:27.632
and say hi to Tiffany.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.498
I didn't come by at
a bad time did I?

17:31.533 --> 17:34.191
No, not at all. Come on in.

17:36.365 --> 17:38.540
So, how you doing son?

17:38.574 --> 17:40.197
I'm fine sir.

17:40.231 --> 17:41.508
How's Deborah doing?

17:41.543 --> 17:43.096
She's good.

17:43.131 --> 17:44.822
She's been working a lot
of overtime though lately,

17:44.856 --> 17:47.480
so I haven't even really
seen much of her as of late,

17:47.514 --> 17:50.103
but I'm always thankful for
when I do get to see her

17:50.138 --> 17:51.104
of course.

17:51.139 --> 17:52.623
Amen to that.

17:52.657 --> 17:55.108
You know, next time you see
her, tell her that I said I hope

17:55.143 --> 17:56.696
to see her in
church this Sunday.

17:56.730 --> 17:57.490
Okay.

17:57.524 --> 17:58.974
Both of us.

17:59.008 --> 18:00.044
You should come to.

18:00.976 --> 18:02.736
I'll consider it.

18:06.154 --> 18:08.432
Come on, let's let
them have their privacy.

18:10.019 --> 18:11.193
Goodnight.

18:11.228 --> 18:12.194
Goodnight.

18:12.229 --> 18:17.130
Goodnight, Marquise.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.069
What's wrong?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.070
What?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.209
Look at Marquise' car.

18:27.244 --> 18:29.108
Boy, that boy no good.

18:31.006 --> 18:33.422
What, he ain't got no rims?

18:33.457 --> 18:36.736
Oh, see that's why he need to
come to the church and pray.

18:36.770 --> 18:39.532
God don't want him riding
around with no rims like that.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.672
And his tires, oh they're dusty.

18:41.706 --> 18:44.192
Oh he need some help.

18:44.226 --> 18:46.194
Help is on the way, what?

18:46.228 --> 18:48.092
He just came in and just
found that mess there.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.163
You don't think he's gonna
be mad about that though?

18:50.198 --> 18:53.201
But he don't have to come
in here yelling like he crazy.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.239
It's his house.

18:57.274 --> 19:00.035
It doesn't matter,
I don't care.

19:00.069 --> 19:03.142
Kev, what's up bro?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.143
What's up man?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.456
How you been?

19:07.491 --> 19:09.078
I've been good.

19:09.113 --> 19:11.184
Me and my daddy been working
down at the church a lot.

19:11.219 --> 19:12.220
For the Lord.

19:12.254 --> 19:13.152
I feel you.

19:14.049 --> 19:15.188
How you been?

19:15.223 --> 19:16.776
Ah man, same old, same old.

19:16.810 --> 19:18.571
I was over here just
listening to Tiff

19:18.605 --> 19:21.608
tell me about the drama going
on between her and your dad.

19:21.643 --> 19:24.197
You know, Tiff is a
little throwed off up there.

19:24.232 --> 19:25.612
Shut up, Kevin.

19:25.647 --> 19:29.271
Yo, you wouldn't believe
the craziness that happened

19:29.306 --> 19:30.652
to me today.

19:30.686 --> 19:33.275
I was just about to tell her,
right before you came in.

19:33.310 --> 19:35.035
Craziness huh.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.416
Yeah.

19:36.451 --> 19:37.417
You wouldn't happen to be
talking about you getting fired

19:37.452 --> 19:38.384
now would you?

19:40.903 --> 19:41.870
Jasmine.

19:41.904 --> 19:43.112
Of course she did.

19:43.147 --> 19:44.252
I remember when you
got us fired from that

19:44.286 --> 19:46.495
clothing store back in the day.

19:46.530 --> 19:48.463
And I was making
hundreds of dollars.

19:48.497 --> 19:51.535
And then you got us fired
from the community service job

19:51.569 --> 19:52.467
and that was free.

19:52.501 --> 19:54.158
Something wrong with you man.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.504
I'm a pray for you.

19:55.539 --> 19:57.196
I think you should really
look at this as an opportunity

19:57.230 --> 19:58.507
to finish writing your book.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.820
I think you need to
take Tiffany's advice.

20:00.854 --> 20:03.581
It's not often that a
brain like Tiffany come up

20:03.616 --> 20:05.134
with a good idea.

20:05.169 --> 20:07.033
Don't you have
somewhere to be, Kevin?

20:07.067 --> 20:08.241
Like where?

20:08.276 --> 20:09.415
Somewhere, anywhere but here.

20:09.449 --> 20:11.244
Get get gone.

20:11.279 --> 20:13.419
I gotta get going myself,
man, I gotta break the bad news

20:13.453 --> 20:15.075
to my god mom.

20:15.110 --> 20:16.456
Hope she don't kick you out.

20:16.491 --> 20:18.078
You ain't got no money either.

20:18.113 --> 20:20.253
Well, I can't holler
at you about no money.

20:20.288 --> 20:22.842
Oh, your birthday,
next month right?

20:22.876 --> 20:23.567
Yeah.

20:24.602 --> 20:25.948
Alright.

20:25.983 --> 20:27.329
Why you asking?

20:27.364 --> 20:29.228
I just want know, birthday.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.508
Alright, Kev.

20:37.443 --> 20:39.272
Why are you so weird?

20:39.307 --> 20:42.931
I'm getting the man some
rims for that little ragged

20:42.965 --> 20:44.450
piece of car he got
for his birthday.

20:44.484 --> 20:45.658
But you could have
just told him that.

20:45.692 --> 20:47.556
That's not how I roll.

20:47.591 --> 20:50.904
We're not in high school
anymore, Kevin, grow up.

20:50.939 --> 20:51.733
Go to bed.

20:51.767 --> 20:52.975
Whatever.

20:53.010 --> 20:53.631
Hmm.

21:08.197 --> 21:08.957
G'ma.

21:16.896 --> 21:17.690
Hello?

22:01.389 --> 22:05.979
I'm not
working nine to five.

22:06.014 --> 22:10.087
This is the book, this is
what's suppose to get me.

22:11.985 --> 22:13.642
Upon seeing the clear.

22:15.541 --> 22:16.335
Stupid.

22:45.053 --> 22:46.261
Might as well.

22:59.861 --> 23:00.551
Doing.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.315
Yo, make a decision, man.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.355
Cuzzo, where you at?

23:47.184 --> 23:47.978
Quise

23:50.877 --> 23:54.225
Oh my gosh, David,
when did you get out?

23:54.260 --> 23:55.675
Hey, auntie.

23:55.710 --> 23:57.194
You're looking good.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.852
Life treating you well,
you're adjusting okay?

23:59.886 --> 24:01.025
I can't complain.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.925
Yeah, staying out of trouble?

24:03.959 --> 24:05.029
Trying.

24:05.064 --> 24:05.823
Uh hmm.

24:05.858 --> 24:06.721
Is that a yes or a no?

24:08.032 --> 24:09.482
That's a yes.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.415
Uh huh, come sit down.

24:14.038 --> 24:17.490
Yeah, I've been staying
out of trouble, but you know

24:17.525 --> 24:21.390
like I know, life could
throw you some curve balls.

24:21.425 --> 24:24.463
So the key would be to
condition yourself to react

24:24.497 --> 24:27.949
differently whenever life
throws these curve balls huh.

24:27.983 --> 24:30.020
Yeah, that's easier
said than done.

24:30.054 --> 24:32.229
Especially when you been
taught out here to survive.

24:32.263 --> 24:34.265
You've got to react a
certain type of way.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.475
It is what it is.

24:37.614 --> 24:41.480
You know, I pray
for you all the time.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.136
And I've never
lost faith in you.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.036
I appreciate it.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.521
Where's the time gone?

24:50.385 --> 24:52.145
I wish I could tell you.

24:53.733 --> 24:57.012
Oh, I need to
get ready for work.

24:59.187 --> 25:00.568
Good seeing you, David.

25:00.602 --> 25:01.569
Nice talking to you.

25:03.122 --> 25:06.366
Hey, make sure
nothing happens to him.

25:06.401 --> 25:07.367
I got you.

25:07.402 --> 25:08.990
I'll hold you to it.

25:09.024 --> 25:09.715
Hold me.

25:17.343 --> 25:18.378
Sup?

25:20.346 --> 25:21.485
What was all that about?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.555
Ain't nothing.

25:22.590 --> 25:24.039
You ready to go get this bread?

25:24.074 --> 25:25.489
I wanted to talk to you first.

25:26.421 --> 25:27.526
Here we go.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.700
Just listen, alright.

25:29.735 --> 25:30.529
I've been thinking.

25:32.427 --> 25:34.429
Let's just say God is real.

25:34.463 --> 25:36.707
Hypothetically speaking, right.

25:38.191 --> 25:41.367
Do you ever get the feeling
that he only looks out

25:41.401 --> 25:42.989
for certain people?

25:43.024 --> 25:44.232
And?

25:44.266 --> 25:47.580
For instance, both you
and I lost our parents

25:47.615 --> 25:50.549
at a very young age,
the both of us, right.

25:51.895 --> 25:54.414
We went in separate
paths, but look at us now.

25:55.795 --> 25:57.038
We on the same path.

25:58.418 --> 26:03.492
You remember that scripture
your mom use to always say?

26:05.287 --> 26:06.185
Which one, man?

26:06.219 --> 26:07.635
She had a lot.

26:07.669 --> 26:12.191
I think it was something
like, there's a time to live,

26:12.225 --> 26:13.951
a time to die.

26:13.986 --> 26:16.126
Oh yeah, a time to
laugh and a time to cry.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.472
Yeah.

26:17.506 --> 26:19.267
Well, my understanding
on that is,

26:20.579 --> 26:22.408
the only thing
guaranteed is death.

26:24.617 --> 26:25.445
Yeah.

26:26.895 --> 26:31.762
Yeah, so, when that time
come, cuz, you better go out

26:34.351 --> 26:35.766
with a bang.

26:41.669 --> 26:42.773
I mean, I hear you.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.777
But do you feel me?

26:46.812 --> 26:50.505
I mean, yeah.

26:51.575 --> 26:53.025
Hey man, puff your chest up.

26:53.059 --> 26:55.475
Bro, let's slide
and get this money.

27:08.557 --> 27:10.249
Let me see your keys?

27:10.283 --> 27:11.906
What you want my keys?

27:11.940 --> 27:13.528
'Cause I said so.

27:13.562 --> 27:14.978
You know we gotta
switch it up, man.

27:15.012 --> 27:16.945
Why you asking all
these questions?

27:16.980 --> 27:20.604
I think we was
gonna take the caddy.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.193
When you gonna let
me drive the caddy?

27:23.227 --> 27:25.574
When you get your paper up.

27:26.714 --> 27:27.542
Alright.

27:32.374 --> 27:34.653
See you change your mind.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.000
Honestly, I feel like
I did not have a choice.

27:37.034 --> 27:38.933
You always got a choice.

27:38.967 --> 27:40.313
You don't understand man.

27:41.521 --> 27:44.697
I got so many bills just
hanging over my head.

27:44.732 --> 27:46.665
Man, you're
preaching to the choir.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.464
Check it out.

27:53.499 --> 27:56.502
I don't know if you heard, but
Bird got locked last night.

27:56.536 --> 27:57.192
Locked?

27:58.746 --> 28:01.369
Police got him on
some bogus warrant.

28:01.403 --> 28:04.130
He's gonna be down
for a little minute.

28:08.134 --> 28:10.205
You know me, I don't kick it
with nobody like that, so.

28:12.104 --> 28:13.346
You know I trust you?

28:13.381 --> 28:14.313

33:00.979 --> 33:04.189
Can you grab one off the
back shelf there for me?

Thank you.

33:17.788 --> 33:19.514
What do you want?

33:19.549 --> 33:21.585
This glass reminds
me of your club.

33:21.620 --> 33:22.862
Yeah.

33:22.897 --> 33:25.969
It's always
empty. Take it easy.

33:26.004 --> 33:26.763
Funny guy.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.144
Nice to meet you.

33:28.178 --> 33:28.972
Good friend of mine.

33:38.844 --> 33:40.294
Well, how much of
that thing you want?

33:41.847 --> 33:43.159
Yeah, I'm in for the night,

33:43.193 --> 33:45.368
first thing in the morning.

33:45.402 --> 33:46.127
Wow.

33:46.162 --> 33:47.680
Hey babe.

33:47.715 --> 33:49.958
Is your money right tho?

33:49.993 --> 33:51.995
Yeah, because I can't
afford to take any shorts.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.066
I was gonna say that I
brought home some food,

33:54.101 --> 33:55.964
but I guess you're not hungry.

33:55.999 --> 33:57.380
Stop playing, of
course I'm hungry man.

33:57.414 --> 33:58.174
No, no.

33:58.208 --> 33:59.002
Come here, man.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.003
You really hungry?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.384
Yes, yes.

34:01.418 --> 34:02.661
Nope, no dinner
for you tonight.

34:02.695 --> 34:03.869
Wait, where you going?

34:03.903 --> 34:05.871
No dinner for you.

34:05.905 --> 34:07.631
Now I gotta go
hungry. Stop playing.

34:07.666 --> 34:08.943
Uh hmm.

34:08.977 --> 34:10.393
Yeah.

34:10.427 --> 34:11.497
Huh?

34:11.532 --> 34:13.016
What do you mean?

34:13.051 --> 34:15.053
'Cause money ain't
coming in like it use to.

34:15.087 --> 34:16.916
Yeah, old boy getting
all the paper.

34:17.883 --> 34:20.644
It's all good though.

34:20.679 --> 34:24.027
Me and my partner about to
line him and Marquise up.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.341
Yeah, we got a youngin'
just itching to put the

34:27.375 --> 34:28.894
wet work in.

34:28.928 --> 34:31.897
That's my word man, and then,
we'll be back to business

34:31.931 --> 34:33.036
as usual.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.487
Little did
we know, Mitch and Tommy

34:35.521 --> 34:36.867
were scheming to get rid of us.

34:39.974 --> 34:41.872
Lookie what the
cat dragged in.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.600
G'ma, what you doing
here at this time?

34:45.635 --> 34:48.845
Ah, I wasn't feeling very
well, so I came home. Early.

34:48.879 --> 34:50.674
Oh no.

34:50.709 --> 34:52.297
Could I get you anything?

34:52.331 --> 34:54.747
No, that's okay sweetie,
I had a cup of tea earlier.

34:54.782 --> 34:56.370
I'm gonna go ahead
and call it a night.

34:56.404 --> 34:57.716
Everything alright?

34:57.750 --> 34:59.062
Yeah.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.098
You sure?

35:01.099 --> 35:01.927
Yeah.

35:03.446 --> 35:05.275
Nothing you want to tell me?

35:05.310 --> 35:07.622
Nothing I can think of.

35:07.657 --> 35:11.039
How about the fact
that you were fired?

35:12.765 --> 35:15.699
Because I thought that we
had the type of relationship

35:15.734 --> 35:18.392
that was strong enough that
you would have thought to

35:18.426 --> 35:19.945
let me know about such a thing.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.017
Ah, maybe I was wrong.

35:24.950 --> 35:26.054
You're not wrong.

35:27.642 --> 35:29.472
We do have that kind
of relationship.

35:29.506 --> 35:33.441
And I did try and
tell you afterwords.

35:33.476 --> 35:36.410
I came here expecting to tell
you, but you weren't here

35:36.444 --> 35:38.032
so I just.

35:38.066 --> 35:41.380
Hey, don't stress
it. I understand.

35:42.899 --> 35:47.904
You know, but I want you
to know I'm here for you

35:49.181 --> 35:50.631
no matter what.

35:52.046 --> 35:53.979
And I hope you know
that you can come to me

35:54.013 --> 35:55.291
and talk about anything.

36:06.094 --> 36:09.960
William, come to bed honey,
you need to get some rest.

36:09.995 --> 36:10.823
Yes, I know love.

36:12.515 --> 36:14.724
I've just got too much
on my mind to sleep.

36:15.897 --> 36:17.554
Well, did you
finish your sermon?

36:18.762 --> 36:19.625
I sure did.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.111
Would you believe I've
had this sermon on my mind

36:23.146 --> 36:24.423
for a few months now?

36:26.322 --> 36:28.703
I've been working on it
for a couple of weeks.

36:29.980 --> 36:34.053
It is titled The
Consequences of Our Actions.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.677
Hmm.

36:36.711 --> 36:39.024
Can I hear what
you're gonna say?

36:40.025 --> 36:41.302
You sure can.

36:42.510 --> 36:45.341
Hold on, let me
get my glasses on.

36:45.375 --> 36:46.065
Get ready.

36:48.930 --> 36:53.556
Making word, and now
let me get comfy.

36:59.320 --> 37:03.151
Let me start by asking
y'all a question.

37:04.636 --> 37:06.465
Have you ever done something?

37:09.054 --> 37:12.230
Let me start by asking
y'all a question.

37:13.714 --> 37:17.131
Have you ever done something
that you knew was wrong,

37:17.165 --> 37:20.099
but because no one else
knew about it, you thought

37:20.134 --> 37:21.618
you got away with it?

37:23.344 --> 37:27.210
Isn't it funny how we think
that God can't see what we do

37:27.245 --> 37:28.142
in the dark?

37:55.514 --> 38:00.519
We try to rationalize our
non-Christ-like behavior.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.212
But just because God will
forgive us, and Jesus died

38:04.247 --> 38:07.250
for that very same reason,
doesn't mean that we are

38:07.285 --> 38:11.012
exempt for the consequences
of our actions.

38:11.047 --> 38:12.013
Can I get an amen?

38:12.048 --> 38:13.498
Amen.

38:15.845 --> 38:18.641
Turn with me in your Bibles
to the book of the prophet

38:18.675 --> 38:21.091
Isaiah chapter one.

38:21.126 --> 38:24.025
We're going to be
reading verses 19 and 20.

38:25.233 --> 38:26.890
When you have it
say it, say amen.

38:26.925 --> 38:28.651
If you need a minute, say
I need a minute pastor.

38:28.685 --> 38:30.308
Need a minute.

38:33.380 --> 38:34.829
Is everybody there?

38:34.864 --> 38:36.279
Amen.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.108
Let's all read it together.

38:38.143 --> 38:41.249
If you are willing and
obedient, you shall eat the

38:41.284 --> 38:42.837
good of the lamb.

38:42.872 --> 38:45.909
But if you refuse and rebel,
you shall be devoured by

38:45.944 --> 38:50.431
the sword, for the mouth
of the Lord has spoken.

38:50.466 --> 38:53.089
Now, what this passage of
scripture is saying to me,

38:53.123 --> 38:55.609
that for every action,
there will either be a

38:55.643 --> 38:59.198
positive consequence or
a negative consequence.

38:59.233 --> 39:01.304
Either we are going to
eat the good of the land,

39:01.339 --> 39:04.687
or we are going to be
devoured by the sword.

39:04.721 --> 39:07.483
So ultimately it's up to us
what we reap, because we're

39:07.517 --> 39:09.243
the ones doing the sowing.

39:16.284 --> 39:20.047
Didn't God say in Deuteronomy
30 and 19 to choose life?

39:20.081 --> 39:20.737
Yes.

39:22.152 --> 39:26.156
Weren't we told in Joshua
24 and 15 to choose ye

39:26.191 --> 39:28.089
this day whom you will serve?

39:28.124 --> 39:30.091
- Yeah.
- Amen.

39:30.126 --> 39:33.647
Church, God has
given us free will.

39:33.681 --> 39:37.029
So it's up to us to make
a conscious effort to make

39:37.064 --> 39:38.686
the right choices.

39:38.721 --> 39:39.722
Can I get an amen?

39:39.756 --> 39:40.964
Amen.

39:40.999 --> 39:42.207
Can God get an amen?

39:42.241 --> 39:44.485
Amen.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.107
Amen, hallelujah.

39:47.005 --> 39:48.972
Praise God, hallelujah.

39:49.007 --> 39:53.563
Thank you, amen. Hallelujah.

39:53.598 --> 39:59.120
Now, I want you to help me
welcome a very special guest.

39:59.155 --> 40:00.639
Our own Pastor Hutchens.

40:05.955 --> 40:07.094
Thank you, pastor.

40:08.682 --> 40:12.410
Since you mentioned
consequences, let's
stay right there.

40:13.928 --> 40:17.760
Do y'all know how many times
in the Bible God says he

40:17.794 --> 40:22.143
will visit the sins of a
father upon his children

40:22.178 --> 40:25.457
to the third and
fourth generation?

40:25.492 --> 40:27.114
So, how did you
enjoy the sermon?

40:27.148 --> 40:28.287
It was food for the spirit.

40:28.322 --> 40:29.944
Thank you. I really
needed to hear that.

40:29.979 --> 40:31.290
Uh huh.

40:31.325 --> 40:33.431
Hey, listen man, I need
some advice from you.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.018
Okay.

40:35.053 --> 40:36.572
Lately, my relationship
with Tiffany has become

40:36.606 --> 40:39.402
very strained and I just
don't know what to do anymore.

40:40.748 --> 40:42.163
Hmm.

40:42.198 --> 40:44.027
What we wouldn't give
to be young again, huh.

40:47.134 --> 40:48.722
You know what?

40:48.756 --> 40:51.379
You have a very unique
way of saying a whole lot

40:51.414 --> 40:52.967
without saying much at all, man.

40:53.002 --> 40:54.728
It was so good
to see you today.

40:54.762 --> 40:56.557
Oh my gosh, it's so good

40:56.592 --> 40:59.249
to come back.
I know, I'm so happy

40:59.284 --> 41:00.388
you could make it.

41:00.423 --> 41:01.597
What a great message
for me to come back to.

41:01.631 --> 41:02.598
Oh good.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.636
I'll see you ladies later.

41:06.671 --> 41:08.051
- Oh okay, bye.
- See ya.

41:10.537 --> 41:12.400
Mom, can I talk
to you for a second?

41:12.435 --> 41:13.332
Oh.

41:13.367 --> 41:14.161
I'll catch up with you later.

41:14.195 --> 41:14.886
Bye sweetie.

41:16.197 --> 41:18.234
Um, Marquise is gonna
give me a ride home today.

41:21.582 --> 41:22.376
Okay, baby.

41:23.791 --> 41:26.035
I'll be here helping your
father with afternoon services,

41:26.069 --> 41:30.660
but we'll be heading straight
home after it concludes.

41:30.695 --> 41:31.419
Hey love.

41:41.637 --> 41:43.397
How you doing, Tiffany?

41:43.431 --> 41:45.468
Hi Mr. and Mrs. Norton,
how are you doing?

41:45.503 --> 41:46.952
Doing great, thank you.

41:46.987 --> 41:48.402
Did you enjoy the service?

41:48.436 --> 41:49.610
Enjoyed it very much.

41:49.645 --> 41:51.060
Great, I'm glad you did.

41:51.094 --> 41:52.061
You're getting so
big, you look so pretty.

41:52.095 --> 41:52.682
Thank you.

41:53.787 --> 41:54.719
Have a great day.

41:54.753 --> 41:55.443
You too.

the sky I'll fly

been able to come by lately.

It's just, work
has been so crazy.

42:19.502 --> 42:21.435
It's
okay, we understand.

42:21.469 --> 42:24.162
It just seems that the most
we can hope for these days

42:24.196 --> 42:25.577
is to break even.

42:25.612 --> 42:27.890
I've got 20 hours worth
of overtime in this week,

42:27.924 --> 42:31.341
and I still very rarely
have any disposable income.

42:31.376 --> 42:34.241
Trust me, we know exactly
what you're going through.

42:34.275 --> 42:36.623
Sweetie, why don't
you lead us into prayer?

42:36.657 --> 42:37.900
Yes, of course.

42:37.934 --> 42:41.455
You know, why don't we
pray for God's favor

42:41.489 --> 42:44.320
over our families
and our finances?

42:47.461 --> 42:51.430
Dear God, give us the
strength to overcome these

42:51.465 --> 42:55.296
financial headwinds and
continue to look over our family

42:55.331 --> 42:57.057
and our friends.

42:57.091 --> 43:01.889
And Lord, give us the strength
to overcome all adversities,

43:03.304 --> 43:06.722
whether it be spiritual,
mental, physical, or financial.

43:06.756 --> 43:08.482
We thank you.

43:08.516 --> 43:10.380
We thank you for all
that you have done for us

43:10.415 --> 43:13.521
and all that you will
continue to do for us.

43:13.556 --> 43:15.800
You are the truth and the light.

43:17.318 --> 43:20.321
And even in our darkest
hours, we're able to see,

43:20.356 --> 43:23.531
because of the light
that resides within us.

43:23.566 --> 43:25.879
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

43:25.913 --> 43:27.087
Amen.

43:27.121 --> 43:27.777
Amen.

43:30.573 --> 43:32.368
How is Marquise doing, Debra?

43:33.680 --> 43:35.578
Funny you should ask.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.132
Because I have been praying
over him a lot lately.

43:38.167 --> 43:39.375
And I don't even know why.

43:40.687 --> 43:44.760
You know, he would be
such a powerful advocate

43:44.794 --> 43:48.384
for the kingdom if he decided
to give himself to God.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.766
I know, I know, but
unfortunately, that is still

43:50.800 --> 43:52.457
a very sore subject with him.

43:52.491 --> 43:53.872
Why is that?

43:53.907 --> 43:56.841
Well, you remember his
father was killed when he

43:56.875 --> 43:58.118
was a small boy.

43:58.152 --> 44:00.465
And a few years later,
when Sabrina died,

44:00.499 --> 44:01.535
it just devastated him.

44:01.569 --> 44:03.123
Hmm.

44:03.157 --> 44:04.365
And he refused to believe
that they were really gone

44:04.400 --> 44:06.160
and he thought they were
just gonna come back

44:06.195 --> 44:10.199
and when that didn't
happen, he just blamed God.

44:11.821 --> 44:14.582
I thought that when he
would grow up, he would

44:14.617 --> 44:16.308
think differently.

44:16.343 --> 44:19.518
And unfortunately, that hasn't
happened, at least not yet.

44:19.553 --> 44:21.037
In fact, it's gotten worse.

44:23.488 --> 44:28.217
But having said that, I
still maintain that once

44:28.251 --> 44:31.427
he gets married and has a
family of his own to raise,

44:31.461 --> 44:32.670

Somebody playing with you, man.

47:57.495 --> 47:59.255
I don't know where
that come from, D.

47:59.290 --> 48:01.533
Playboy, I don't
play about my money.

48:01.568 --> 48:02.638
And you still owe me.

48:04.226 --> 48:05.330
Come on, let's slide.

48:09.438 --> 48:11.647
You talking about you a
younger version of Suge Knight.

48:11.681 --> 48:14.132
You're more like a dumb
version of Sugar Bear.

48:14.167 --> 48:15.340
What you want me to do?

48:15.375 --> 48:16.548
Get myself hurt messing

48:17.653 --> 48:19.068
with that man?

48:19.103 --> 48:20.690
So your girlfriend went
out swiping yesterday.

48:20.725 --> 48:22.347
Which one was it, 'cause
it sure enough wasn't me.

48:22.382 --> 48:23.417
Man, whatever yo.

48:23.452 --> 48:24.211
Ain't no whatever.

48:24.246 --> 48:25.005
Who are you?

48:25.040 --> 48:26.110
You know what?

48:26.144 --> 48:27.732
I'll tell you who he is.

48:27.766 --> 48:29.216
Man, you just big for nothing.

48:30.045 --> 48:31.736
Let me ask you something.

48:31.770 --> 48:35.567
Have you been smacked by crisp
hundred dollar bills, huh?

48:35.602 --> 48:38.018
Thought not. Man, get
out of my face, man.

48:38.053 --> 48:39.813
Move.

48:39.847 --> 48:40.676
Forget y'all man.

48:46.164 --> 48:47.579
Thought you guys left.

48:47.614 --> 48:48.649
That'll be $58.75.

48:48.684 --> 48:49.650
Thank you.

48:49.685 --> 48:50.755
He'll take care of that.

48:50.789 --> 48:52.412
Come on girl, let's go.

48:52.446 --> 48:54.345
Hey, wait wait,
where y'all going?

48:54.379 --> 48:56.036
As far away from
you as possible.

48:56.071 --> 48:57.969
Look, I ain't go no
money to pay for this food.

48:58.004 --> 49:00.627
You'll figure it out like
you always do...gangsta

49:02.663 --> 49:04.217
That'll be $58.75.

49:04.251 --> 49:05.839
Didn't you just see me
saying I ain't got no money?

49:05.873 --> 49:07.427
Well, someone's
gotta pay for it.

49:07.461 --> 49:09.084
Look, I don't know what
to tell you.

49:15.021 --> 49:16.677
Hi, may I help you?

49:16.712 --> 49:19.749
My name is Tiffany Evans,
I'm here for an appointment.

49:19.784 --> 49:20.819
Okay.

49:20.854 --> 49:21.648
Here's my ID.

49:23.098 --> 49:25.686
I actually got a call
earlier today, saying that

49:25.721 --> 49:28.172
Dr. Singler wanted to see
me as soon as possible,

49:28.206 --> 49:29.173
so I'm here.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.004
Are you a patient of his or
is this your first time here?

49:34.626 --> 49:35.800
Are you serious?

49:35.834 --> 49:37.491
Did I say something wrong?

49:37.526 --> 49:39.459
I mean, why would the
office be calling me in

49:39.493 --> 49:41.081
unless I was already a patient?

49:41.116 --> 49:42.910
My bad.

49:42.945 --> 49:45.361
I'm new and I'm just trying
to figure things out.

49:45.396 --> 49:46.914
It can be overwhelming.

49:46.949 --> 49:49.503
So sign in right here, have
a seat, and Dr. Singler

49:49.538 --> 49:50.642
should be with you shortly.

49:58.064 --> 49:59.755
Jaz.

49:59.789 --> 50:00.790
Tiff?

50:00.825 --> 50:02.033
Hey girl, what's up?

50:02.068 --> 50:03.000
Hey.

50:03.034 --> 50:04.277
What are you doing here?

50:04.311 --> 50:06.520
What am I doing here,
what are you doing here?

50:07.625 --> 50:09.834
We haven't spoke in a while.

50:09.868 --> 50:10.766
Uh hmm.

50:11.870 --> 50:13.217
Tiff?

50:13.251 --> 50:15.840
Okay, let's just say
you'll be helping me

50:15.874 --> 50:17.462
plan my baby shower.

50:17.497 --> 50:18.877
You're baby shower?

50:18.912 --> 50:19.740
Yeah.

50:19.775 --> 50:20.741
What?

50:20.776 --> 50:22.881
Congratulations.

50:22.916 --> 50:25.608
Yeah, yeah.

50:25.643 --> 50:27.817
Hmm, well no wonder I
haven't heard from you

50:27.852 --> 50:29.957
since I told you
Marquise got fired.

50:29.992 --> 50:31.442
Girl, speaking of.

50:31.476 --> 50:32.236
Uh hmm.

50:32.270 --> 50:33.685
Okay, so listen.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.962
I kind of blew your
cover a little bit.

50:34.997 --> 50:36.274
Of course you did.

50:36.309 --> 50:40.002
Listen, I accidentally
slipped up and told him

50:40.037 --> 50:43.143
that I knew he got fired
before he could even tell me.

50:43.178 --> 50:44.524
And the first thing
he did was blame you.

50:44.558 --> 50:46.112
He said "I know Jasmine
told you, 'cause she got

50:46.146 --> 50:47.630
"a big mouth."

50:48.976 --> 50:50.185
You're my girl and he
knows it, so whatever.

50:50.219 --> 50:51.945
Exactly, that's
what I'm saying.

50:51.979 --> 50:54.775
And honestly, if it wasn't
for you, I don't know

50:54.810 --> 50:56.087
what I would know.

50:56.122 --> 50:57.813
Marquise doesn't
tell me anything.

50:59.125 --> 51:02.438
Well, speaking of
Marquise, come here.

51:02.473 --> 51:05.510
Ugh, what is it now?

51:08.789 --> 51:11.999
I hear he's been hustling
with his cousin D-Rock lately.

51:12.034 --> 51:14.657
Drugs?

51:14.692 --> 51:15.762
Tiff, come on.

51:15.796 --> 51:16.901
No way.

51:16.935 --> 51:18.661
Yes, I'm telling you.

51:18.696 --> 51:21.112
And I'm hearing that
some other competition

51:21.147 --> 51:25.185
has it out for them, so
tell him to be careful.

51:27.774 --> 51:32.503
Look, I'm only telling you
this because you're my girl

51:32.537 --> 51:34.988
and you got a nice
little situation now.

51:42.202 --> 51:45.205
Okay, Ms. Ortiz, I'll
see you again in 30 days.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.242
Okay, Dr. Singler.

51:47.276 --> 51:50.728
And please, make sure to take
your medicine as prescribed.

51:50.762 --> 51:52.385
Do not skip a dosage.

51:52.419 --> 51:55.284
I won't. I learned
my lesson the hard way.

51:55.319 --> 51:57.528
Okay, now, you take care.

51:57.562 --> 51:58.184
You too.

51:59.840 --> 52:02.567
See you in a few months for
my colonoscopy Dr. Singler.

52:07.779 --> 52:08.780
Girl.

52:12.853 --> 52:14.441
Ms. Evans.

52:14.476 --> 52:18.963
Okay, but listen, I
gotta go, but can you wait?

52:18.997 --> 52:20.620
I really want to finish
this conversation.

52:20.654 --> 52:22.829
No, I gotta be somewhere
in like 15 minutes.

52:22.863 --> 52:24.382
You always have
somewhere to go.

52:24.417 --> 52:26.177
I just came back
to get my phone.

52:26.212 --> 52:27.972
Okay, well call me later,
I need to see this doctor,

52:28.006 --> 52:30.008
but we need to have
this conversation.

52:30.043 --> 52:31.976
I have a lot of
questions for you.

52:32.010 --> 52:33.150
I got you.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.668
Okay.

52:34.703 --> 52:35.980
But don't forget to
tell Marquise what I said.

52:36.014 --> 52:38.327
Girl, I'm gonna tell
him something alright.

52:38.362 --> 52:39.017
That's right.

52:46.818 --> 52:49.580
Well, the reason we
requested for you to come in

52:49.614 --> 52:51.823
is because your blood test
shows that your RH factor

52:51.858 --> 52:52.997
is negative.

52:53.031 --> 52:55.241
In all likelihood, your
baby's RH positive,

52:55.275 --> 52:57.622
unless the baby's father
is RH negative as well.

52:59.141 --> 53:02.040
Umm, can we simplify
this a little bit.

53:02.075 --> 53:03.973
What does that mean?

53:04.008 --> 53:06.010
Basically, being that
you're RH negative,

53:06.044 --> 53:08.392
if your baby is RH positive,
your blood could mix

53:08.426 --> 53:10.566
when you give birth,
which would be a problem.

53:10.601 --> 53:12.050
What do I need to do next?

53:12.085 --> 53:14.294
Can we have the baby's
father take a blood test

53:14.329 --> 53:16.227
to determine if
he's RH negative?

53:16.262 --> 53:19.057
If he is then the baby will
be, and the problem solved.

53:19.092 --> 53:21.508
If he's not, then I'll
prescribe you some medication

53:21.543 --> 53:23.821
to prevent any problems in
the event that your blood

53:23.855 --> 53:26.064
and the baby's blood were
to mix as you give birth.

53:26.099 --> 53:28.653
Me and the father aren't
really on speaking terms

53:28.688 --> 53:29.965
right now.

53:29.999 --> 53:32.485
Is there any other
options for me?

53:32.519 --> 53:33.934
Then you may have to
get what's called an

53:33.969 --> 53:36.282
amniocentesis or AM Test done.

53:36.316 --> 53:40.217
This will allow us to see if
the baby's RH negative as well.

53:40.251 --> 53:42.322
The test is relatively
safe with very small chance

53:42.357 --> 53:44.876
of complications, and it
allows to screen the baby

53:44.911 --> 53:46.809
for genetic disorders as well.

53:46.844 --> 53:49.674
You said a small
chance of complications?

53:49.709 --> 53:52.850
Yes, but it's nothing
to really worry about.

53:54.369 --> 53:55.162
Okay.

54:16.011 --> 54:16.770
Hey baby.

54:19.842 --> 54:21.292
Baby, what's wrong?

54:21.327 --> 54:21.982
Nothing.

54:23.432 --> 54:26.021
Well, do you want to
go get something to eat?

54:26.055 --> 54:27.954
Just take me home, Marquise.

54:27.988 --> 54:30.059
Now, you know I'm not
leaving until you tell me

54:30.094 --> 54:32.683
what's wrong, 'cause clearly
something's bothering you.

54:34.788 --> 54:37.688
I heard you've been doing
business with your cousin.

54:37.722 --> 54:40.553
Is that why you've been
having so much money lately?

54:40.587 --> 54:41.933
Who told you that?

54:41.968 --> 54:42.727
Does it matter?

54:46.559 --> 54:49.251
Look, I've been trying
to stack some money up,

54:49.286 --> 54:52.323
to build towards having this
family that we both want.

54:52.358 --> 54:55.084
Okay, so yes, I have
been putting in some
work with D-Rock.

54:55.119 --> 54:56.948
I don't care about
the money, Marquise.

54:56.983 --> 54:58.053
Well, you need to.

54:58.087 --> 54:59.054
You don't remember
me telling you.

54:59.088 --> 55:00.124
I'm a man.

55:00.158 --> 55:01.712
As a man, I have
to be a provider.

55:01.746 --> 55:03.196
I've seen this story
before, so I already know

55:03.230 --> 55:04.473
how it ends.

55:04.508 --> 55:08.443
With you either going
to jail or worse, dead.

55:08.477 --> 55:09.858
It's not gonna happen.

55:14.483 --> 55:17.693
Listen, Marquise, I'm not
even gonna go back and forth

55:17.728 --> 55:20.420
with you, okay, but you
have a decision to make.

55:20.455 --> 55:23.389
It's either me or those streets.

55:23.423 --> 55:25.598
But you can't have both.

55:25.632 --> 55:27.289
Are you being
serious right now?

55:27.324 --> 55:28.359
I'm serious.

55:29.981 --> 55:34.986
Look babe, just
relax, chill alright.

55:36.402 --> 55:37.989
I'll tell D-Rock I'm out.

55:39.094 --> 55:40.026
Okay?

55:42.339 --> 55:44.168
Okay.

55:44.202 --> 55:45.859
Thank you.

55:45.894 --> 55:47.344
Fine, your makeup
about to run.

55:49.311 --> 55:51.140
You gonna have
your dad mad at me.

55:53.211 --> 55:55.593
♪ Get ready

56:21.032 --> 56:24.242
Okay, yeah.

56:24.277 --> 56:27.384
Yeah, I gotta just stop
by the house first.

56:29.869 --> 56:30.628
Okay.

♪ Get ready, change

How you doing young man?

57:10.668 --> 57:11.497
I'm doing well.

57:11.531 --> 57:13.153
You mind if we walk?

57:13.188 --> 57:14.361
Yeah.

57:14.396 --> 57:16.571
So tell me man, how's
life treating you?

57:16.605 --> 57:20.126
Couple of rough patches.

57:20.160 --> 57:21.886
Just lost my job the other day.

57:23.163 --> 57:26.028
So gotta kind of work
on that a little bit.

57:26.063 --> 57:28.583
Anything else you
want to talk about?

57:28.617 --> 57:29.791
Did you watch the
game last night?

57:29.825 --> 57:31.068
You know I watched that game.

57:31.102 --> 57:33.139
Let's go inside
and talk about it.

57:33.173 --> 57:35.244
Make sure you close
that door behind you.

57:35.279 --> 57:36.349
Okay, alright.

57:38.903 --> 57:40.284
Thank you.

57:40.318 --> 57:43.287
Go ahead man, go on
and grab you a seat.

57:43.321 --> 57:44.150
Pull up a chair.

57:45.772 --> 57:47.118
Make yourself comfortable.

57:52.020 --> 57:54.643
So, from what I understand,
you've been given a unique gift

57:54.678 --> 57:57.059
to be able to write
some amazing stories.

57:57.094 --> 57:58.578
Is that correct?

57:58.613 --> 58:00.649
I'm an average
writer man, at best.

58:02.306 --> 58:04.273
Come on son,
don't be modest now.

58:04.308 --> 58:06.517
You're gonna make it big
one day using that gift

58:06.552 --> 58:08.105
that God has given you.

58:08.139 --> 58:10.866
And when you, Marquise, you're
gonna have a huge platform.

58:10.901 --> 58:12.834
Do you understand what
that will allow you to do

58:12.868 --> 58:14.076
for the kingdom?

58:14.111 --> 58:15.526
Hmm?

58:15.561 --> 58:19.012
I believe that you been anointed
to be able to reach those

58:19.047 --> 58:21.221
that society has
deemed unreachable.

58:21.256 --> 58:24.259
Those who have been born
under the same circumstances

58:24.293 --> 58:26.054
as you.

58:26.088 --> 58:28.539
But first you gotta get right
with God so you can be able

58:28.574 --> 58:30.507
to be that beacon of light
to those still living

58:30.541 --> 58:32.370
in darkness.

58:32.405 --> 58:34.165
I don't know
about that, pastor.

58:35.373 --> 58:37.652
I have enough of my own problems
to worry about as it is.

58:37.686 --> 58:39.895
Well, most times in life,
we look for the answers

58:39.930 --> 58:42.898
to our problems outward,
when the answers reside

58:42.933 --> 58:46.730
within us, and those
answers come from God.

58:46.764 --> 58:49.767
Now, he doesn't always
give you what you want,

58:49.802 --> 58:51.562
but he always gives
you what you need.

58:53.322 --> 58:55.324
Why don't you stop by
tomorrow and give me a hand

58:55.359 --> 58:56.912
around here.

58:56.947 --> 59:00.157
All I'm asking for is about
six hours out of your day.

59:00.191 --> 59:02.711
How much did you make
at your last job?

59:02.746 --> 59:03.470
I don't want to tell you.

59:03.505 --> 59:04.782
Come on, man, try me.

59:07.233 --> 59:08.303
$9 an hour.

59:08.337 --> 59:09.546
That's alright.

59:09.580 --> 59:12.376
I'll tell you what, I'll
pay you $10 an hour.

59:12.410 --> 59:15.690
If you like the arrangement,
you can continue on.

59:15.724 --> 59:18.313
If you don't like
the arrangement,
you're not obligated

59:18.347 --> 59:20.039
to continue.

59:20.073 --> 59:23.870
That should provide you
with some financial help.

59:23.905 --> 59:26.424
So you can be able to
focus on those God-given

59:26.459 --> 59:27.702
writing abilities.

59:27.736 --> 59:29.358
You gonna pay me
weekly or bi-weekly?

59:29.393 --> 59:31.222
Man, I will pay you
weekly, bi-weekly,

59:31.257 --> 59:32.810
whatever you want.

59:32.845 --> 59:35.951
I ain't gonna hold your money
now, that's not in the word.

59:35.986 --> 59:37.746
You gonna take
tithes out of my check?

59:37.781 --> 59:40.128
I aint' gonna be taking no
tithes, but we will receive

59:40.162 --> 59:41.336
your offering.

59:41.370 --> 59:43.372
Alright, alright,
you have a deal.

59:43.407 --> 59:44.719
Deal.

59:44.753 --> 59:46.548
Before you go though,
there's something I'd like

59:46.583 --> 59:47.618
to talk to you about.

59:47.653 --> 59:49.137
Okay.

59:49.171 --> 59:51.588
How are things coming along
between you and Tiffany?

59:51.622 --> 59:53.348
Things have been really well.

59:53.382 --> 59:56.040
Okay, okay, just asking.

59:56.075 --> 59:57.766
She doesn't talk
to me much lately.

59:57.801 --> 59:58.940
I'm sorry to hear that sir.

59:58.974 --> 1:00:00.666
Son, it's not your fault.

1:00:00.700 --> 1:00:03.807
Don't worry, you're gonna
have kids of your own one day.

1:00:03.841 --> 1:00:05.636
You know, I'm
looking forward to it.

1:00:08.156 --> 1:00:10.089
But not before you
get married, right.

1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:16.302
I mean, I don't necessarily
know what to say to that.

1:00:19.823 --> 1:00:22.446
You do know premarital
sex goes against everything

1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:23.378
we believe in.

1:00:27.313 --> 1:00:28.763
Well, alrighty in.

1:00:32.249 --> 1:00:33.733
Tomorrow at noon.

1:00:33.768 --> 1:00:36.218
Yeah, ah, yes sir.

1:00:37.288 --> 1:00:38.635
Sounds good.

1:00:38.669 --> 1:00:41.154
Thank you though
for the opportunity

1:00:41.189 --> 1:00:42.328
and the conversation.

1:00:45.331 --> 1:00:46.090
You're welcome.

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:56.894
After our
conversation, Pastor Evans

1:00:56.929 --> 1:00:59.207
was very suspicious of me
and Tiffany's relationship.

1:01:08.837 --> 1:01:13.497
Look, um, I don't know
how to ask you this,

1:01:13.531 --> 1:01:16.189
so I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

1:01:16.224 --> 1:01:18.260
Have you had relations
with Marquise?

1:01:23.093 --> 1:01:24.025
Yeah.

1:01:26.648 --> 1:01:29.133
And I'm pregnant with
his baby right now.

1:01:30.445 --> 1:01:33.034
Let's just get this over with.

1:01:33.068 --> 1:01:38.729
Go ahead, tell me how
disappointed you are.

1:01:38.764 --> 1:01:40.869
And how I'm still in college

1:01:40.904 --> 1:01:43.078
with my entire life ahead of me.

1:01:43.113 --> 1:01:46.461
And what's even worse,
I'm not even married.

1:01:48.118 --> 1:01:51.811
God forbid an out of wedlock
pregnancy because what a

1:01:51.846 --> 1:01:55.366
scandal that would be when
your precious church finds out.

1:01:55.401 --> 1:01:58.784
And I can hear them
gossiping already.

1:01:58.818 --> 1:02:00.786
Did you hear about
the pastor's daughter?

1:02:00.820 --> 1:02:02.097
How dare you.

1:02:02.132 --> 1:02:03.616
So, now it's my fault
that you're pregnant.

1:02:03.650 --> 1:02:05.376
If you would have just-

1:02:05.411 --> 1:02:06.757
If I had been
what, Tiffany, huh?

1:02:06.792 --> 1:02:08.517
When are you gonna grow up and
learn to take responsibility

1:02:08.552 --> 1:02:09.933
for your own actions young lady?

1:02:09.967 --> 1:02:13.039
Instead of going through life
with this woe is me mentality.

1:02:13.074 --> 1:02:15.559
You probably care more
about what the congregation

1:02:15.593 --> 1:02:18.631
is gonna think than
you do about me.

1:02:18.665 --> 1:02:23.222
What they think and how they
feel has always mattered

1:02:23.256 --> 1:02:24.361
more to you.

1:02:24.395 --> 1:02:26.604
I've heard enough alright.

1:02:26.639 --> 1:02:29.366
Now I will always be there
for you, but I refuse to be

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:30.850
your punching bag.

1:02:30.885 --> 1:02:32.265
You let me know
when you're ready

1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:33.508
to have a real conversation.

1:03:07.542 --> 1:03:08.612
Hey, my brother.

1:03:08.646 --> 1:03:09.855
What's up, Deak.

1:03:09.889 --> 1:03:12.305
What are you doing on
this beautiful Saturday?

1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:13.859
Man, listen,
mind if I sit down?

1:03:13.893 --> 1:03:15.377
Yeah, have a seat. Have a seat

1:03:16.447 --> 1:03:18.449
Is everything alright Bill?

1:03:18.484 --> 1:03:19.554
Hey, Pastor.

1:03:19.588 --> 1:03:20.555
Hey Evelyn.

1:03:20.589 --> 1:03:21.487
How are you?

1:03:21.521 --> 1:03:22.902
I'm doing good, how are you?

1:03:22.937 --> 1:03:24.179
I'm doing good.

1:03:24.214 --> 1:03:25.318
Can I get you guys
something to drink,

1:03:25.353 --> 1:03:26.733
water or coffee maybe?

1:03:26.768 --> 1:03:29.391
No, I'm good, but I
appreciate the offer though.

1:03:29.426 --> 1:03:30.185
Thank you.

1:03:30.220 --> 1:03:31.117
You're welcome.

1:03:31.152 --> 1:03:32.601
Well, I'll leave you boys alone.

1:03:33.533 --> 1:03:34.603
If you need anything,
just let me know.

1:03:35.604 --> 1:03:37.537
Thank you.

1:03:37.572 --> 1:03:38.642
Is everything alright?

1:03:38.676 --> 1:03:40.437
You look a little flustered.

1:03:41.438 --> 1:03:42.439
I don't know, man.

1:03:44.096 --> 1:03:46.512
I've been fighting a
spiritual battle lately.

1:03:46.546 --> 1:03:48.548
And I'm afraid it
feels like I'm losing.

1:03:48.583 --> 1:03:49.860
But that's impossible.

1:03:49.895 --> 1:03:51.379
And why is that?

1:03:51.413 --> 1:03:53.760
Because you are a
strong man of God.

1:03:53.795 --> 1:03:55.901
And that battle that you
speak of was won way before

1:03:55.935 --> 1:03:57.178
it started.

1:03:57.212 --> 1:03:58.558
And that's where my
problem begins, man,

1:03:58.593 --> 1:04:01.147
Deak, I'm starting to
question my calling.

1:04:01.182 --> 1:04:01.838
But why?

1:04:04.254 --> 1:04:06.463
I think my pastoral
duties are destroying my

1:04:06.497 --> 1:04:09.052
relationship with
my daughter, man.

1:04:09.086 --> 1:04:11.778
Pardon my candor,
but that's ridiculous.

1:04:11.813 --> 1:04:13.021
I beg your pardon.

1:04:13.056 --> 1:04:14.609
What you're saying is
you believe your calling

1:04:14.643 --> 1:04:16.197
is a mistake.

1:04:17.957 --> 1:04:18.785
Maybe.

1:04:21.581 --> 1:04:26.586
Romans 11:29 says for
God's gifts and his call

1:04:28.174 --> 1:04:29.900
are irrevocable.

1:04:29.935 --> 1:04:32.282
And this is true, but
no matter how hard I try,

1:04:32.316 --> 1:04:34.111
I just can't get
through to her, man.

1:04:36.527 --> 1:04:37.632
You know what?

1:04:38.495 --> 1:04:40.186
I didn't mean to trouble you.

1:04:40.221 --> 1:04:41.601
It's no burden.

1:04:41.636 --> 1:04:45.226
Listen, without a struggle,
there could be no victory.

1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:48.160
Without a test, there
could be no testimony.

1:04:48.194 --> 1:04:50.645
You are a mighty
warrior for the kingdom.

1:04:50.679 --> 1:04:53.303
Which is why I decided many
moons ago to go stand with you

1:04:53.337 --> 1:04:55.615
on that battlefield.

1:04:55.650 --> 1:04:59.240
You cannot allow the
enemy to gain a foothold

1:04:59.274 --> 1:05:01.276
in your relationship
with Tiffany.

1:05:01.311 --> 1:05:04.210
'Cause sooner or later,
you will lose her.

1:05:07.524 --> 1:05:11.183
You know what you
have to do right?

1:05:11.217 --> 1:05:13.702
Yeah, I sure do.

1:05:15.290 --> 1:05:16.360
Thank you my brother.

1:05:17.258 --> 1:05:19.501
I really needed to hear that.

1:05:19.536 --> 1:05:20.813
Of course man.

1:05:20.847 --> 1:05:21.745
Thank you Deak.

1:05:23.229 --> 1:05:24.472
Alright, I gotta go.

1:05:24.506 --> 1:05:25.162
Alright.

1:05:50.567 --> 1:05:51.533
Come here.

1:06:00.163 --> 1:06:01.854
I'm so sorry.

1:06:01.888 --> 1:06:03.407
I'm so sorry.

1:06:03.442 --> 1:06:06.893
I love you so much, more
than you'll ever know.

1:06:06.928 --> 1:06:09.724
It's just that I got so
caught up with trying to be

1:06:09.758 --> 1:06:12.554
everything to everybody else,
that I forgot to spend time

1:06:12.589 --> 1:06:15.040
with you and your mother.

1:06:15.074 --> 1:06:18.319
I'm here for you. I will
always be here for you.

1:06:18.353 --> 1:06:22.944
But baby girl, I need you to
make better choices, okay.

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:24.049
Okay, daddy.

1:06:24.083 --> 1:06:25.360
Alright.

1:06:25.395 --> 1:06:27.569
You cannot continue
to have relations

1:06:27.604 --> 1:06:28.812
with Marquise unmarried.

1:06:28.846 --> 1:06:31.435
There are consequences
to that, baby girl.

1:06:33.437 --> 1:06:34.611
Okay, dad.

1:06:34.645 --> 1:06:36.130
Look at me, I want
you to listen to me.

1:06:36.164 --> 1:06:39.926
If you don't remember nothing
else that I say to you,

1:06:39.961 --> 1:06:42.722
I want you to always
put God first, alright.

1:06:44.069 --> 1:06:47.072
I want you to trust him,
I want you to seek him.

1:06:47.106 --> 1:06:49.902
And he'll never lead you astray.

1:06:49.936 --> 1:06:51.593
Can you please do that for me?

1:06:53.492 --> 1:06:55.045
Yes, daddy, I can.

1:06:57.392 --> 1:06:59.153
Come here.

1:07:05.849 --> 1:07:10.785
♪ There I was all alone

1:07:12.131 --> 1:07:17.136
♪ A tattered soul,
you made me whole

1:07:20.415 --> 1:07:26.007
♪ And I want to thank
you for your smile

1:07:26.042 --> 1:07:28.009
♪ Do do do do

1:07:36.742 --> 1:07:37.777
Hey baby.

1:07:37.812 --> 1:07:38.675
Hey, babe.

1:07:39.641 --> 1:07:41.850
Kev, what's up bro?

1:07:41.885 --> 1:07:43.128
My brother in Lord.

1:07:46.234 --> 1:07:47.408
Man, I was starting to think
Bible study is canceled, man.

1:07:47.442 --> 1:07:48.823
Canceled?

1:07:48.857 --> 1:07:50.135
Yeah.

1:07:50.169 --> 1:07:51.791
Oh no. I just had to
swing by and pick her up.

1:07:51.826 --> 1:07:53.862
'Cause when she told me she
wanted to come to Bible study,

1:07:53.897 --> 1:07:55.657
I was shocked.

1:07:55.692 --> 1:07:57.142
I think you're rubbing
off on her, my brother.

1:07:57.176 --> 1:07:58.833
Hey well, God is good.

1:07:58.867 --> 1:08:01.629
Oh, your birthday tomorrow.

1:08:01.663 --> 1:08:02.837
Yes.

1:08:02.871 --> 1:08:04.390
Got a surprise for you my man.

1:08:04.425 --> 1:08:05.702
Kevin, what you got?

1:08:05.736 --> 1:08:07.635
Oh, trust me, it's
something you need.

1:08:07.669 --> 1:08:09.257
I prayed about it
and everything.

1:08:09.292 --> 1:08:11.052
I got you man, you
gonna be surprised.

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:13.675
And don't even ask,
'cause if I told you,

1:08:13.710 --> 1:08:15.677
it wouldn't be a
secret would it?

1:08:15.712 --> 1:08:16.575
Let it marinate. Don't
even say nothing.

1:08:16.609 --> 1:08:17.955
Y'all be good.

1:08:17.990 --> 1:08:19.095
Alright.

1:08:19.129 --> 1:08:20.682
That's your brother, man.

1:08:20.717 --> 1:08:24.169
Listen, I already told
you one of us is adopted.

1:08:24.203 --> 1:08:26.757
You gotta stop it, seriously.

1:08:26.792 --> 1:08:29.174
Honestly, your brother is
the coolest person I know.

1:08:30.382 --> 1:08:32.729
I'm the coolest
person you know.

1:08:32.763 --> 1:08:33.971
Let's just get that straight.

1:08:35.490 --> 1:08:39.770
I would say you're like
second coolest. It's close.

1:08:39.805 --> 1:08:41.634
You're crazy, you've lost it.

1:08:41.669 --> 1:08:43.774
Listen, I'm just
messing with you.

1:08:43.809 --> 1:08:45.811
See, that's why I love you.

1:08:45.845 --> 1:08:47.123
Umm, why is that?

1:08:49.090 --> 1:08:53.405
Gosh. I love
you because of your smile.

1:08:53.439 --> 1:08:55.510
Uh hmm. It's amazing.

1:08:55.545 --> 1:08:57.271
I love you because
of your sense of humor.

1:08:57.305 --> 1:08:58.203
Of course.

1:08:59.721 --> 1:09:02.138
And your sarcasm.

1:09:05.486 --> 1:09:06.866
Whatever.

1:09:06.901 --> 1:09:08.385
Nah, seriously though, you
got the whole enchilada babe.

1:09:08.420 --> 1:09:09.145
Seriously.

1:09:10.629 --> 1:09:15.323
Well, if you love me
so much, can you promise

1:09:15.358 --> 1:09:16.255
to never leave me?

1:09:21.226 --> 1:09:24.436
Yes, I can promise
to never leave you.

1:09:24.470 --> 1:09:25.713
Awesome.

1:09:25.747 --> 1:09:26.714
Can you promise
the same thing?

1:09:26.748 --> 1:09:28.681
Of course, I promise.

1:09:28.716 --> 1:09:29.613
Okay.

1:09:29.648 --> 1:09:30.959
Unless.

1:09:30.994 --> 1:09:32.547
Unless what?

1:09:32.582 --> 1:09:34.446
You tell me I'm the second
coolest person you know again.

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:35.447
You got that straight?

1:09:35.481 --> 1:09:36.586
There you go.

1:09:48.253 --> 1:09:49.081
Hey.

1:09:50.047 --> 1:09:51.670
Kevin.

1:09:51.704 --> 1:09:54.880
Sorry about that, I didn't
mean to scare you, Ms. Deborah.

1:09:54.914 --> 1:09:56.261
It's okay.

1:09:56.295 --> 1:09:57.745
You looking for your buddy?

1:09:57.779 --> 1:09:59.298
Yeah, where the birthday
boy at, where he at?

1:09:59.333 --> 1:10:00.955
He's still sleeping.

1:10:00.989 --> 1:10:02.163
I tried to wake him up to
wish him a happy birthday.

1:10:02.198 --> 1:10:03.199
Kid sleeps like a log.

1:10:05.201 --> 1:10:06.926
You mind if I give it a shot?

1:10:06.961 --> 1:10:08.342
Have at it. I'm late for work.

1:10:08.376 --> 1:10:09.550
Alright, you be good now.

1:10:09.584 --> 1:10:10.275
Goodbye.

1:10:19.870 --> 1:10:20.837
Happy birthday.

1:10:23.288 --> 1:10:24.358
What?

1:10:24.392 --> 1:10:25.497
Wait a minute.

1:10:27.119 --> 1:10:29.225
Hey, hey, hey.

1:10:30.398 --> 1:10:31.951
Alright, have it your way then.

1:10:43.100 --> 1:10:46.518
Happy birthday boy,
happy birthday.

1:10:46.552 --> 1:10:47.312
Thanks man.

1:10:48.761 --> 1:10:51.212
Oh, I see you went
and got taped up huh.

1:10:51.247 --> 1:10:53.801
Oh, I gotta stay
fresh for the Lord.

1:10:53.835 --> 1:10:55.527
Yes, I do, God is good.

1:10:55.561 --> 1:10:56.528
All the time.

1:10:56.562 --> 1:10:59.565
All the time, God is good.

1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:00.980
Those mine?

1:11:01.015 --> 1:11:02.292
Yeah, man,

1:11:02.327 --> 1:11:03.224
they was laying over here
on the nightstand man.

1:11:03.259 --> 1:11:04.708
Matter of fact, what is this?

1:11:04.743 --> 1:11:06.296
Those are the notes.

1:11:06.331 --> 1:11:08.471
Book I just started
writing again.

1:11:08.505 --> 1:11:10.818
You back write your
book. God is good.

1:11:10.852 --> 1:11:12.889
Look at you.

1:11:12.923 --> 1:11:15.271
Wanted to change your
life and you're doing it.

1:11:16.375 --> 1:11:18.722
Working through
your book and stuff.

1:11:18.757 --> 1:11:21.932
Man, and you doing a great
job down at the church.

1:11:21.967 --> 1:11:24.349
Even attending Bible study.

1:11:24.383 --> 1:11:25.867
I always knew you had it in you.

1:11:25.902 --> 1:11:27.835
You just had to get
out your own way.

1:11:27.869 --> 1:11:29.526
So you could make it happen.

1:11:29.561 --> 1:11:32.564
I gotta give you some
appreciation though, man,

1:11:32.598 --> 1:11:33.772
'cause you always believed me.

1:11:33.806 --> 1:11:35.394
Oh yeah, give God the glory.

1:11:35.429 --> 1:11:37.189
Give God the glory.

1:11:37.223 --> 1:11:39.398
What's up with you
though, what are your plans?

1:11:39.433 --> 1:11:41.262
Oh, I'm just gonna
chill today, ain't
doing nothing major,

1:11:41.297 --> 1:11:43.506
just gonna stay
fresh, for the Lord.

1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:45.922
No, no.

1:11:45.956 --> 1:11:47.337
Longterm, bro.

1:11:47.372 --> 1:11:50.029
Oh, I'm going back to school.

1:11:50.064 --> 1:11:50.996
Yeah?

1:11:51.030 --> 1:11:52.169
To get a degree in theology.

1:11:52.204 --> 1:11:53.792
Theology?

1:11:53.826 --> 1:11:55.897
Yeah, so when my father
ready to pass the baton,

1:11:55.932 --> 1:11:57.313
I'll be ready.

1:11:57.347 --> 1:11:59.729
And in the meantime, I can
help him with his ministry.

1:11:59.763 --> 1:12:00.833
That's good, I could
see that for you, man.

1:12:00.868 --> 1:12:02.766
Oh yeah, God is good.

1:12:02.801 --> 1:12:03.802
I like that for you.

1:12:03.836 --> 1:12:05.804
Oh yes. God got us, man.

1:12:07.633 --> 1:12:09.152
Well, let me get your
keys, I'm a go ahead

1:12:09.186 --> 1:12:10.740
and get out of here.

1:12:10.774 --> 1:12:12.673
Why, what you need my
keys for, what you doing?

1:12:12.707 --> 1:12:14.847
Man, I'm gonna go get some
rims on that raggedy car man.

1:12:14.882 --> 1:12:17.609
Your car looking bad
for your birthday.

1:12:17.643 --> 1:12:19.058
'Cause you look like
you're struggling man.

1:12:19.093 --> 1:12:20.957
Look like you don't even know
God, the way your car looking.

1:12:20.991 --> 1:12:22.027
Come on man.

1:12:22.061 --> 1:12:23.235
You're about to put
rims on my car for real?

1:12:23.269 --> 1:12:25.030
Yeah, happy birthday, brother.

1:12:25.064 --> 1:12:26.480
You ain't got to do that, man.

1:12:26.514 --> 1:12:30.794
I know, but once I made my
mind up, you know it's final.

1:12:30.829 --> 1:12:33.003
Kevin decided
to stop by the nearest store

1:12:33.038 --> 1:12:35.143
on his way to getting
the rims for my car.

1:12:38.906 --> 1:12:41.046
You know, it has been
fun, but we really do need

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:41.978
to get going.

1:12:43.428 --> 1:12:44.981
What, they closed?

1:12:45.015 --> 1:12:48.640
Ah man, and this boy's
car hot, needs some AC.

1:12:53.058 --> 1:12:54.024
You're crazy man.

1:12:54.059 --> 1:12:54.853
Yeah.

1:13:08.073 --> 1:13:09.419
So what you gonna do?

1:13:09.454 --> 1:13:10.903
What you mean,
what I'm gonna do?

1:13:10.938 --> 1:13:12.146
Man, what you gonna do, man?

1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:14.044
What you mean, what do I mean?

1:13:14.079 --> 1:13:16.046
They done shot your homeboy.

1:13:16.081 --> 1:13:18.014
I think we just need to
let God deal with this man.

1:13:18.048 --> 1:13:19.222
Let God deal with it?

1:13:19.256 --> 1:13:22.225
Man, I'm tired of
you and this praying.

1:13:22.259 --> 1:13:23.916
You pray, pray,
pray, and you broke.

1:13:23.951 --> 1:13:25.021
So what you wanna do?

1:13:25.055 --> 1:13:26.125
You wanna just go
roll up on them.

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:27.023
You praying and your homeboy

1:13:27.057 --> 1:13:29.232
in critical condition right now.

1:13:29.266 --> 1:13:32.477
Have you forgot
where we from, huh?

1:13:32.511 --> 1:13:34.306
We don't pray.

1:13:34.340 --> 1:13:36.964
We send them to God, and
let him deal with it.

1:13:39.725 --> 1:13:41.347
So, what you gonna do?

1:13:43.971 --> 1:13:44.765
Huh?

1:13:48.285 --> 1:13:51.047
Let's go, let's go.

1:13:51.081 --> 1:13:51.944
Let's go man.

1:13:58.503 --> 1:14:00.332
So, tell me a little
bit about yourself.

1:14:00.366 --> 1:14:02.645
What brought you down
to his place here?

1:14:02.679 --> 1:14:04.647
Well, they transferred
me over here.

1:14:04.681 --> 1:14:08.340
You know, I'm ready to make
a difference, you know.

1:14:08.374 --> 1:14:09.134
Yeah.

1:14:10.515 --> 1:14:12.896
Exactly what I use to think.

1:14:12.931 --> 1:14:14.588
What do you mean?

1:14:14.622 --> 1:14:16.003
My father was a cop.

1:14:16.037 --> 1:14:18.488
So of course, it was real
important that I became one.

1:14:19.765 --> 1:14:22.147
15 years, he gave his
life to this precinct.

1:14:22.181 --> 1:14:24.183
I hardly ever saw the guy.

1:14:24.218 --> 1:14:25.978
15 years.

1:14:26.013 --> 1:14:28.187
Last thing I wanted to
do was become a cop.

1:14:28.222 --> 1:14:30.983
And when I did, all I wanted
to do was do the right thing.

1:14:31.018 --> 1:14:32.364
Yeah.

1:14:32.398 --> 1:14:35.125
I wanted to do the best I
could to clean this place up.

1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:37.265
You start off well,
you mean well.

1:14:39.923 --> 1:14:41.338
Then you realize that you're
not dealing with normal people

1:14:41.373 --> 1:14:42.167
out here.

1:14:43.548 --> 1:14:47.034
There all savages.
There's no law, no rules.

1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:50.209
Savages?

1:14:50.244 --> 1:14:52.833
Yeah, yeah.

1:14:52.867 --> 1:14:55.352
Hey, y'all didn't
tell me your homeboy

1:14:55.387 --> 1:14:57.907
was a madman.

1:14:57.941 --> 1:14:59.218
You ready?

1:14:59.253 --> 1:15:00.185
Ready.

1:15:00.219 --> 1:15:01.531
Ain't no turning back.

1:15:02.428 --> 1:15:03.775
I know.

1:15:03.809 --> 1:15:07.019
Just like the
ten commandments.

1:15:07.054 --> 1:15:08.262
Written in stone.

1:15:16.822 --> 1:15:17.823
I told him it
was the wrong hit,

1:15:17.858 --> 1:15:18.583
and he still went top busting.

1:15:24.140 --> 1:15:25.659
Whoa, did you hear that?

1:15:25.693 --> 1:15:27.592
Yeah, sounded like gunshots.

1:15:27.626 --> 1:15:28.627
I'm calling it in.

1:15:28.662 --> 1:15:30.491
No. This is our call.

1:15:31.872 --> 1:15:32.666
We got this.

1:15:47.197 --> 1:15:48.267
Police!

1:15:48.302 --> 1:15:50.097
Hold it right there.

1:15:50.131 --> 1:15:52.306
Let me see those hands.

1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:53.583
Both of you.

1:15:53.618 --> 1:15:55.585
Let me see those
hands right now.

1:15:55.620 --> 1:15:58.795
Let me see those
hands or you're dead.

1:16:00.417 --> 1:16:01.142
That's
when I knew I had

1:16:01.177 --> 1:16:02.005
to turn my life around.

1:16:03.386 --> 1:16:06.596
D-Rock took the charges
and copped out to 10 years,

1:16:06.631 --> 1:16:08.598
just so I could have a future.

1:16:08.633 --> 1:16:11.705
Business started booming
for Mitch and Tommy.

1:16:11.739 --> 1:16:15.398
As a result, they all got
caught up in sting operation

1:16:15.432 --> 1:16:19.505
and got 25 years to
life for conspiracy.

1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:22.301
Even Mitch old girl,
Diamond, got caught up in it.

1:16:22.336 --> 1:16:24.338
Kevin survived, but the bullet
that hit him in his back

1:16:24.372 --> 1:16:26.340
severed his spinal
cord and paralyzed him

1:16:26.374 --> 1:16:28.238
from the waist down.

1:16:28.273 --> 1:16:33.174
Gentlemen and gentlemen,
I'm here to talk to you all

1:16:34.451 --> 1:16:37.489
today about how when you
fall, how to get back up.

1:16:39.180 --> 1:16:41.148
After everything
we had gone through,

1:16:41.182 --> 1:16:43.771
Tiffany and I both realized
it was God that got us

1:16:43.806 --> 1:16:45.221
through it.

1:16:45.255 --> 1:16:48.569
Lord, I want to thank you
for helping me to look past

1:16:48.604 --> 1:16:54.195
my selfish ways and helping
me to mend my relationship

1:16:54.230 --> 1:16:55.956
with my father.

1:16:55.990 --> 1:16:58.234
So we both
our lives over to him.

1:16:58.268 --> 1:17:03.135
Dear Lord, I'm asking
forgiveness for
all my sins, Lord.

1:17:06.242 --> 1:17:09.901
Soon thereafter, Tiffany
and I decided to do the

1:17:09.935 --> 1:17:12.248
right thing and get married.

1:17:12.282 --> 1:17:16.942
Do you Marquise take
Tiffany to be your lawfully

1:17:16.977 --> 1:17:20.670
wedded wife, keep her in
sickness and in health,

1:17:20.705 --> 1:17:24.709
forsaking all others, as
long as you both shall live?

1:17:24.743 --> 1:17:26.296
I do.

1:17:26.331 --> 1:17:31.094
Tiffany, do you take
Marquise to be your lawfully

1:17:31.129 --> 1:17:34.132
wedded husband, do you
promise before God and these

1:17:34.166 --> 1:17:38.826
witnesses to love him,
comfort him, honor him,

1:17:38.861 --> 1:17:43.313
and keep him in sickness and
in health, forsaking all others

1:17:43.348 --> 1:17:45.281
for as long as you
both shall live?

1:17:45.315 --> 1:17:46.869
I do.

1:17:46.903 --> 1:17:48.940
Now, by the power vested
in me, as a minister of the

1:17:48.974 --> 1:17:52.322
Gospel in the state of
Florida, I now pronounce you

1:17:52.357 --> 1:17:54.083
husband and wife.

1:17:54.117 --> 1:17:57.086
Marquise, you may
kiss your bride.

1:18:05.025 --> 1:18:07.406
Once the book was
done, Pastor Evans hooked me

1:18:07.441 --> 1:18:10.306
up with a publisher that was
a part of his congregation.

1:18:11.997 --> 1:18:13.309
God bless you, Marquise.

1:18:13.343 --> 1:18:14.206
Thank you so much.

1:18:14.241 --> 1:18:15.345
You're welcome.

1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:16.795
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

1:18:16.830 --> 1:18:18.383
Oh my god, oh my god.

1:18:18.417 --> 1:18:21.386
I can't believe I
finally get to meet you.

1:18:21.420 --> 1:18:23.733
I flew all the way
over from Amsterdam,

1:18:23.768 --> 1:18:26.011
and I just got here
for the book signing.

1:18:26.046 --> 1:18:27.426
Wow.

1:18:27.461 --> 1:18:29.808
My book would go on to sell
over three million copies.

1:18:29.843 --> 1:18:32.742
And within five years, I
was able to buy Tiffany

1:18:32.777 --> 1:18:34.054
that house of her dreams.

1:18:35.055 --> 1:18:36.746
Hey.

1:18:36.781 --> 1:18:37.713
Hi, how are you?

1:18:37.747 --> 1:18:39.335
Good, you guys look very nice.

1:18:39.369 --> 1:18:40.129
Thank you.

1:18:40.163 --> 1:18:41.371
You're welcome.

1:18:41.406 --> 1:18:42.372
How are you doing again?

1:18:42.407 --> 1:18:43.373
I'm doing very well.

1:18:43.408 --> 1:18:44.409
Hey baby.

1:18:44.443 --> 1:18:45.237
Hi.

1:18:45.272 --> 1:18:46.894
You ready to see this house?

1:18:46.929 --> 1:18:48.137
Tell your parents
it's really nice.

1:18:49.448 --> 1:18:50.415
Let's
go check it out.

1:18:50.449 --> 1:18:52.555
Come on, let me show you.

1:18:52.589 --> 1:18:54.557
This house is
700,000 square feet.

1:18:54.591 --> 1:18:55.558
My goodness.
