00:01.293 --> 00:02.878
<i>Previously on</i> Good Witch...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.045
Who are you talking to?

00:04.087 --> 00:07.048
Noah. He's visiting his mum

00:04.087 --> 00:07.048
in New York.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.383
I missed you.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.427
-I missed you too.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.427
-Noah!

00:10.469 --> 00:12.346
I always hear about places

00:10.469 --> 00:12.346
with small town charm,

00:12.387 --> 00:15.641
but this place actually has it,

00:12.387 --> 00:15.641
and... I've decided

00:15.683 --> 00:17.100
that this would be

00:15.683 --> 00:17.100
the perfect place

00:17.142 --> 00:18.936
to put

00:17.142 --> 00:18.936
my company's headquarters.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.813
So that means you'd

00:18.978 --> 00:20.813
be living in Middleton?

00:20.855 --> 00:22.857
-Yeah!

00:20.855 --> 00:22.857
-[Cassie]<i> I'm gonna love you</i>

00:22.898 --> 00:25.275
as if each day was the only one

00:22.898 --> 00:25.275
we had. I wrote down

00:25.317 --> 00:27.569
when I wanted

00:25.317 --> 00:27.569
our wedding day to be.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.404
That's less

00:27.611 --> 00:29.404
than three weeks away.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.698
We better get to work.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.451
[upbeat music]

00:42.835 --> 00:44.879
-Good morning.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.879
-Hello.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.463
What's all this?

00:46.505 --> 00:47.798
Different things Sam and I

00:47.840 --> 00:49.466
need to decide on

00:47.840 --> 00:49.466
before the wedding.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.677
Stephanie dropped some cakes

00:49.508 --> 00:51.677
by for us to try,

00:51.719 --> 00:53.929
and I am listening to a band

00:51.719 --> 00:53.929
that Sam wants to hire

00:53.971 --> 00:55.472
for the reception.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.140
I can't believe

00:55.514 --> 00:57.140
you're putting together

00:57.182 --> 00:59.476
an entire wedding

00:57.182 --> 00:59.476
in less than three weeks.

00:59.518 --> 01:02.604
Well, when you're

00:59.518 --> 01:02.604
ready to get married,

00:59.518 --> 01:02.604
the answer is, why wait?

01:02.646 --> 01:05.440
I suppose you're gonna ask me

01:02.646 --> 01:05.440
to do the flowers?

01:05.482 --> 01:07.401
Actually, we were

01:05.482 --> 01:07.401
gonna hire someone else

01:07.442 --> 01:08.777
and let you have the day off.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.111
Oh...

01:10.153 --> 01:12.031
Just kidding. Of course

01:10.153 --> 01:12.031
we want you to do them.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.783
Well, because you want people

01:12.072 --> 01:14.783
to be impressed. Right?

01:14.825 --> 01:17.285
Right. Good morning, Phil.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.287
-Morning.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.287
-Hey.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.999
I heard you and Abigail

01:19.329 --> 01:21.999
come in last night.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.542
Well, I told him

01:22.041 --> 01:23.542
he didn't have to walk me

01:23.584 --> 01:26.127
-all the way home, but...

01:23.584 --> 01:26.127
-Well, you were already home.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.087
All I did was walk you

01:26.169 --> 01:28.087
to your room,

01:26.169 --> 01:28.087
which is right above mine,

01:28.129 --> 01:29.631
so it wasn't

01:28.129 --> 01:29.631
that far of a walk.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.425
Well, it's still sweet of you

01:29.673 --> 01:31.425
to make sure she got there.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.261
-Do you want some breakfast?

01:31.466 --> 01:34.261
-Oh, no.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.888
Thank you. I have to get

01:34.302 --> 01:35.888
to City Hall.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.932
-Oh.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.932
-He's rezoning the old mill

01:37.973 --> 01:39.934
because he wants to move his

01:37.973 --> 01:39.934
company's headquarters here.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.936
Well, I hope things turn out

01:39.975 --> 01:41.936
the way you want them to.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.021
Thank you. May I drop you

01:41.977 --> 01:44.021
at the shop on my way?

01:44.063 --> 01:45.146
Absolutely.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.651
-Hey, Phil.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.651
-Morning.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.362
Oh, Abigail. I'm glad

01:49.693 --> 01:52.362
I caught you. I was wondering--

01:52.404 --> 01:54.031
Sorry, Sam. That's my ride.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.324
[Sam stammering]

01:57.117 --> 01:59.453
[sighing]

01:59.494 --> 02:02.039
I was hoping to talk with her

01:59.494 --> 02:02.039
about doing the flowers

01:59.494 --> 02:02.039
for the wedding.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.540
I already did, and she is.

02:03.582 --> 02:04.583
Hmm.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.668
Great. Oh, how'd

02:04.625 --> 02:06.668
you like the band?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.921
Oh, sign them up. And...

02:08.963 --> 02:10.631
Stephanie brought

02:08.963 --> 02:10.631
by these cakes.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.424
-This one is my favourite.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.424
-Hmm.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.635
Oh, that is good.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.344
[Cassie chuckling]

02:16.386 --> 02:18.847
So this wedding is

02:16.386 --> 02:18.847
actually coming together.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.975
Piece of cake.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.060
You know, I think we should

02:21.016 --> 02:23.060
get our invitations out

02:23.102 --> 02:24.603
before the end of the week.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.814
Yeah. I will try to finish

02:24.645 --> 02:26.814
my list of people to invite.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.440
Okay. I'll do mine too.

02:28.482 --> 02:32.111
Then, all I have to do is

02:28.482 --> 02:32.111
find the right dress to wear.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.072
You could wear jeans

02:32.152 --> 02:35.072
and a t-shirt and still be

02:32.152 --> 02:35.072
the most beautiful bride ever.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.157
I'm not wearing

02:35.114 --> 02:37.157
jeans and a t-shirt.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.367
-Can I wear jeans

02:37.198 --> 02:39.367
and a t-shirt?

02:37.198 --> 02:39.367
-No.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.662
I'm glad I asked you then,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.662
before I showed up on the day.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.920
Fordham University

02:47.292 --> 02:49.920
in New York?

02:49.962 --> 02:51.922
Yeah. They're

02:49.962 --> 02:51.922
offering me a full ride.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.465
The coach even wants

02:51.964 --> 02:53.465
Noah to start practising

02:53.507 --> 02:56.135
before he's

02:53.507 --> 02:56.135
officially enrolled.

02:56.175 --> 02:59.220
-When are you gonna move there?

02:56.175 --> 02:59.220
-As soon as we graduate.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.640
This is really great, Noah.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.350
Congratulations.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.145
What's great?

03:03.391 --> 03:06.145
And congratulations about what?

03:06.185 --> 03:08.897
Noah got accepted at Fordham,

03:06.185 --> 03:08.897
to play baseball there.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.733
Oh! Well, that is great.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.318
You know, when you're starting

03:13.360 --> 03:15.403
for the White Sox someday,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.403
I'm gonna want tickets

03:15.445 --> 03:16.571
along the third baseline.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.365
White Sox?

03:18.406 --> 03:21.242
-No, my son's

03:18.406 --> 03:21.242
gonna be a Yankee.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.242
-Well, then...

03:21.284 --> 03:22.995
He's gonna lose to Chicago.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.204
-We'll see.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.204
-[chuckling]

03:25.246 --> 03:28.042
What is your very favourite

03:25.246 --> 03:28.042
thing that I make?

03:28.083 --> 03:29.793
Mmm, I like

03:28.083 --> 03:29.793
the butterscotch milkshake.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.504
Well, then I'll bring one

03:29.835 --> 03:32.504
of those on the house.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.881
Thanks, Stephanie.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.178
Have you told Grace

03:36.758 --> 03:39.178
you're gonna be

03:36.758 --> 03:39.178
going to school in New York?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.554
Not yet. [sighs]

03:41.889 --> 03:43.306
Where are the colleges

03:41.889 --> 03:43.306
she's thinking about?

03:43.348 --> 03:45.767
Uh, nowhere near New York.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.268
When are you gonna

03:45.809 --> 03:47.268
tell her the news?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.564
Soon as I figure out

03:48.520 --> 03:50.564
what to say.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.655
[grunting]

03:59.990 --> 04:01.700
-Hey, Mum.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.700
-Hi, honey.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.036
Grandpa, what are you doing?

04:04.078 --> 04:05.954
I'm trying to get

04:04.078 --> 04:05.954
this drawer open.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.749
It's just stuck.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.417
You should try

04:08.790 --> 04:10.417
to open it, Grace.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.502
I've already given it

04:10.458 --> 04:12.502
quite a pull.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.462
Well, maybe it needs

04:12.544 --> 04:14.462
a special touch.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.340
I can give it a try.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.969
-Oh!

04:19.009 --> 04:20.969
-Oh! Whoa!

04:22.596 --> 04:24.681
I must have

04:22.596 --> 04:24.681
loosened it for you.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.516
That's probably it.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.562
There's something inside.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.192
It's an envelope.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.278
How long do you think

04:36.526 --> 04:38.278
it's been back there?

04:38.319 --> 04:41.156
Well, that's hard to tell.

04:38.319 --> 04:41.156
That desk has been here

04:38.319 --> 04:41.156
since I moved in.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.450
It might have been there

04:41.198 --> 04:43.450
since Grey House was built.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.914
"My dearest father

04:46.536 --> 04:48.914
and mother..."

04:51.666 --> 04:53.127
It's signed "Elizabeth."

04:54.044 --> 04:55.295
Merriwick?

04:55.336 --> 04:58.506
It looks like it.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.759
"By the time you read

04:58.548 --> 05:00.759
this letter, I will have fled

05:00.801 --> 05:04.721
to pursue a lifetime

05:00.801 --> 05:04.721
with my one and only love."

05:04.763 --> 05:09.350
Oh, she must have written that

05:04.763 --> 05:09.350
before she ran off

05:04.763 --> 05:09.350
to marry Andrew Wymark.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.979
Her father didn't approve,

05:09.392 --> 05:11.979
so they had to elope.

05:12.020 --> 05:16.566
It says here that they planned

05:12.020 --> 05:16.566
a wedding at Grey House.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.402
Oh, I didn't know they were

05:16.608 --> 05:19.402
gonna have the ceremony here.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.404
And she already

05:19.444 --> 05:21.404
had her dress made.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.697
Look, it describes it

05:21.446 --> 05:22.697
right there.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.532
"I mostly regret

05:24.574 --> 05:26.326
that I shall never wear

05:24.574 --> 05:26.326
the gown that was crafted

05:26.367 --> 05:28.411
so carefully for me.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.747
I only hope

05:28.453 --> 05:30.747
the Netherton family

05:30.789 --> 05:33.541
is as joyed to see

05:30.789 --> 05:33.541
their daughter Fiona

05:33.583 --> 05:37.296
walk the aisle as I longed

05:33.583 --> 05:37.296
for you to see me."

05:38.505 --> 05:40.799
So she gave

05:38.505 --> 05:40.799
her wedding dress away?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.676
To Fiona Netherton.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.387
What do you think

05:44.427 --> 05:46.387
happened to it?

05:46.429 --> 05:49.183
I guess we'll have

05:46.429 --> 05:49.183
to ask Fiona Netherton.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.311
George, that would have been

05:49.224 --> 05:52.311
almost 100 years ago.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.647
But... she had to have done

05:52.351 --> 05:55.647
something with her dress

05:55.689 --> 05:56.982
after she got married.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.357
That's true.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.694
I wonder if anyone

05:58.399 --> 06:00.694
ever wore it after that.

[Mayor Tinsdale]<i> What are you</i>

06:23.466 --> 06:25.552
<i>hoping to find in here?</i>

06:25.593 --> 06:27.804
I wanna find out

06:25.593 --> 06:27.804
who married Fiona Netherton

06:27.846 --> 06:29.723
so I can track down

06:27.846 --> 06:29.723
their descendants.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.767
That information should

06:29.764 --> 06:32.767
be in the census records,

06:32.809 --> 06:35.312
and they're in the last filing

06:32.809 --> 06:35.312
cabinet there, on the right.

06:35.354 --> 06:38.148
-Okay.

06:35.354 --> 06:38.148
-But that's if you know the

06:35.354 --> 06:38.148
year she was married exactly.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.524
I don't.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.651
Well then, that's gonna

06:39.566 --> 06:41.651
make this a bit of a hunt.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.781
So, uh...

06:48.116 --> 06:49.617
How goes the wedding planning?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.578
Oh, really well, so far.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.997
You know, they do say that

06:51.619 --> 06:53.997
the days leading up

06:51.619 --> 06:53.997
to a wedding

06:54.039 --> 06:57.292
can be one of the most

06:54.039 --> 06:57.292
stressful times

06:54.039 --> 06:57.292
in any relationship.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.794
Well, it hasn't been

06:57.334 --> 06:59.794
for me and Sam.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.463
Oh. No conflict at all?

07:02.505 --> 07:04.465
Well, we both seem

07:02.505 --> 07:04.465
to want the same things.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.803
Tom and I could hardly agree

07:06.134 --> 07:08.803
on anything about our wedding,

07:08.845 --> 07:10.764
including who we wanted

07:08.845 --> 07:10.764
to be there.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.100
Oh. Well, we haven't decided

07:10.805 --> 07:13.100
on exactly who we want there,

07:13.141 --> 07:15.518
but I'm pretty sure Sam and I

07:13.141 --> 07:15.518
can get on the same page.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.062
Hmm.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.273
What is all this stuff?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.691
Oh, in there? That's mostly

07:19.314 --> 07:21.691
newspaper clippings.

07:21.733 --> 07:25.279
Anything pertaining

07:21.733 --> 07:25.279
to population, increases

07:21.733 --> 07:25.279
and adjustments, you know.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.488
Birth

07:25.320 --> 07:27.488
announcements, funeral notices.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.366
And wedding photos.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.576
But you know, if we don't know

07:31.618 --> 07:33.828
the exact year, then I still

07:31.618 --> 07:33.828
don't know how you're gonna

07:31.618 --> 07:33.828
find what you're looking for.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.789
Well, I know about

07:33.870 --> 07:35.789
when the wedding happened.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.166
About when?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.543
Cassie, that means we could be

07:38.208 --> 07:40.543
searching through who knows

07:40.585 --> 07:42.545
how many clippings

07:40.585 --> 07:42.545
before we find--

07:42.587 --> 07:43.671
I found it.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.385
What? Oh!

07:48.427 --> 07:52.097
-Look at that dress.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.097
-It really is beautiful.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.225
"Fiona Netherton

07:52.139 --> 07:55.225
married Jonathan Powell

07:55.267 --> 07:58.312
last week in a ceremony

07:55.267 --> 07:58.312
at the Botanical Gardens."

07:58.353 --> 08:00.605
So Fiona Netherton

07:58.353 --> 08:00.605
became Fiona Powell.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.274
Well, that's something

08:00.647 --> 08:02.274
to go on at least.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.025
Yeah, it's a start.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.653
You know, that dress

08:04.067 --> 08:06.653
would look gorgeous on you.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.322
[Cassie] It would be perfect,

08:06.694 --> 08:08.322
wouldn't it?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.408
If I can only figure out

08:09.572 --> 08:11.408
where it is...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.537
-Abigail.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.537
-Hello.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.498
Hi. Where are you heading?

08:18.539 --> 08:20.000
I'm just on my way

08:18.539 --> 08:20.000
to Grey House.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.627
Oh, that works out.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.627
I'm going that way too.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.754
How did it go at City Hall?

08:24.796 --> 08:27.341
Oh... not so good.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.717
I filled out form after form.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.594
Then, they told me there's

08:29.759 --> 08:31.594
a backlog, so I won't hear

08:31.636 --> 08:34.264
about my rezoning request until

08:31.636 --> 08:34.264
my application gets to the top

08:34.306 --> 08:35.849
of some huge pile.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.643
-How long is that gonna take?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.643
-They said it could be months!

08:38.685 --> 08:41.562
I was really hoping to get

08:38.685 --> 08:41.562
things moving before then.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.357
You know, sometimes in

08:41.604 --> 08:43.357
Middleton,

08:43.398 --> 08:46.651
things move a lot faster

08:43.398 --> 08:46.651
than you'd think.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.529
So I'm just supposed

08:46.693 --> 08:49.529
to wait around for something

08:46.693 --> 08:49.529
magical to happen?

08:49.570 --> 08:50.864
That's one way of putting it.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.160
You know, I don't always know

08:52.866 --> 08:55.160
exactly what you're saying,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.287
but I sure love

08:55.202 --> 08:57.287
watching you say it.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.956
Well, keep watching

08:57.329 --> 08:59.956
just in case things

08:59.998 --> 09:01.375
get even more interesting.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.421
[soft music playing]

09:06.463 --> 09:08.423
Are you inviting any

09:06.463 --> 09:08.423
of the old gang from New York?

09:08.465 --> 09:11.051
Yeah, I might. It'd be nice

09:08.465 --> 09:11.051
to see Gavin and Pat again.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.261
Do they know that you're

09:11.092 --> 09:13.261
gonna be taking the plunge?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.472
I don't know.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.472
I'll send 'em an invite,

09:13.303 --> 09:15.472
see if they can make it.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.765
-Did you guys enjoy lunch?

09:15.514 --> 09:17.765
-I did...

09:17.807 --> 09:21.228
-'cause he paid.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.228
-Oh. Thanks.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.021
Hey, did you tell Cassie

09:21.269 --> 09:23.021
the news about Noah?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.898
Oh. Noah got accepted

09:23.063 --> 09:24.898
into Fordham.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.774
-Oh, that's great!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.774
-Yeah. They want him there

09:26.816 --> 09:29.194
to start practising as soon

09:26.816 --> 09:29.194
as he can get there.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.072
Which is sooner than you

09:29.236 --> 09:32.072
thought he'd be leaving.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.365
Yeah... I thought I'd have

09:33.407 --> 09:35.283
at least until

09:33.407 --> 09:35.283
the end of summer,

09:35.325 --> 09:37.952
but he's going to be moving as

09:35.325 --> 09:37.952
soon as he graduates now.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.662
And he hasn't told Grace yet.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.122
How do you know that for sure?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.874
She would have

09:41.164 --> 09:42.874
told me right away.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.667
It's gonna be hard

09:42.916 --> 09:44.667
on both of them.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.710
Yeah, it is.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.922
Well, I better

09:47.628 --> 09:48.922
get back to work.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.383
-Okay.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.383
-What's that?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.634
Oh, it's a new piece

09:51.425 --> 09:53.634
by James Cavell.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.597
-Oh. I like it.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.597
-Since when are you

09:53.676 --> 09:57.597
into sculptures?

09:57.638 --> 10:00.141
Since I saw this

09:57.638 --> 10:00.141
and said I like it.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.519
There's an exhibit going on

10:00.183 --> 10:02.519
at the Daverson Gallery

10:02.561 --> 10:04.438
at the old train station.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.898
Maybe I'll check it out.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.776
-Yeah. I gotta go too. Bye.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.776
-Okay. Bye.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.069
See you.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.155
[door bell jingling]

10:19.869 --> 10:21.662
[knocking at door]

10:28.503 --> 10:30.088
Noah! What are you doing here?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.341
There's something

10:31.672 --> 10:33.341
we need to talk about.

10:35.676 --> 10:36.553
Okay.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.141
[knocking at door]

10:46.396 --> 10:48.315
-Agnes!

10:46.396 --> 10:48.315
-Cassie, yes.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.275
-Come in.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.275
-Thank you.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.278
Thank you so much

10:50.317 --> 10:53.278
for letting me come over.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.280
Well, I've been in

10:53.320 --> 10:55.280
your shop a few times

10:55.322 --> 10:57.991
and you were always

10:55.322 --> 10:57.991
so helpful to me in there.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.701
Walter, this is

10:58.032 --> 11:00.701
Cassie Nightingale.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.912
Yes, Agnes told me

11:00.743 --> 11:02.912
you were gonna drop by.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.581
Yes, thank you.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.041
You wanted to know

11:04.623 --> 11:07.041
something about

11:04.623 --> 11:07.041
my mother's wedding dress?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.877
I was wondering if you knew

11:07.083 --> 11:09.877
what happened to it.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.088
Well, you can see for yourself.

11:12.797 --> 11:13.965
-I can?

11:12.797 --> 11:13.965
-Mmm-hmm.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.306
That's me, 62 years ago.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.975
Oh, wow. You looked beautiful.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.811
-And you can see

11:24.017 --> 11:26.811
how happy I was.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.811
-[chuckling]

11:26.853 --> 11:29.272
Wow, that dress

11:26.853 --> 11:29.272
seems so delicate.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.898
Mmm-hmm, I thought so too,

11:30.940 --> 11:34.402
but they made things

11:30.940 --> 11:34.402
to last in those days.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.155
I danced up a storm

11:34.444 --> 11:37.155
and didn't break a stitch.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.325
The initials "E.M."

11:40.367 --> 11:42.285
were sewn into the back

11:40.367 --> 11:42.285
of the collar.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.080
My mother told me

11:43.662 --> 11:46.080
that was her friend.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.543
Elizabeth Merriwick.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.543
She was a relative of mine.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.295
There's also a pocket inside

11:52.337 --> 11:54.255
where I put the love letter

11:52.337 --> 11:54.255
Walter wrote me

11:54.297 --> 11:55.965
the night before we wed.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.759
We both did that,

11:56.007 --> 11:58.759
so we could take them out

11:58.801 --> 12:01.262
and read them to each other

11:58.801 --> 12:01.262
on our first anniversary.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.473
What a beautiful thing to do.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.099
Do you still have the dress?

12:05.141 --> 12:08.687
No. Our daughter-in-law

12:05.141 --> 12:08.687
bought a dress of her own,

12:08.727 --> 12:10.938
so I passed that on

12:08.727 --> 12:10.938
to our granddaughter

12:10.980 --> 12:12.315
when she got married.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.484
I figured something that nice

12:14.526 --> 12:16.777
shouldn't be

12:14.526 --> 12:16.777
packed away in a box.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.112
Do you think she still has it?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.574
I don't know.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.535
Well, I would love to get

12:20.615 --> 12:23.535
in touch with her and find out.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.912
I'll write down

12:23.577 --> 12:25.912
exactly where you can find her.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.205
Thanks.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.541
Yeah, I remember

12:27.247 --> 12:29.541
on that day thinking...

12:29.583 --> 12:34.170
I could never love that woman

12:29.583 --> 12:34.170
any more than I did right then.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.256
But then the next day,

12:34.212 --> 12:36.256
I loved her even more.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.593
And the next day after that.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.803
62 years' worth of days and...

12:42.845 --> 12:46.057
each one stronger

12:42.845 --> 12:46.057
than the day before.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.397
Thanks.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.488
When would you have to leave?

13:01.239 --> 13:03.742
The day after we graduate.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.745
So they must

13:03.782 --> 13:06.745
really want you... bad.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.455
They do.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.624
So you're going.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.293
Yes, but...

13:14.502 --> 13:16.630
you're still gonna

13:14.502 --> 13:16.630
be in Middleton.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.591
I haven't decided

13:16.671 --> 13:19.591
where I'm going to be yet

13:19.633 --> 13:23.177
and... they've got

13:19.633 --> 13:23.177
this thing

13:19.633 --> 13:23.177
called technology now.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.721
[chuckles]

13:24.763 --> 13:26.640
You mean you don't have to be

13:24.763 --> 13:26.640
in the same room as somebody

13:26.681 --> 13:29.392
to have a conversation

13:26.681 --> 13:29.392
with them

13:26.681 --> 13:29.392
and see their face?

13:29.434 --> 13:30.685
It's amazing.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.772
We'll make it work.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.484
And I really am happy for you.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.490
[Stephanie]

13:42.029 --> 13:43.490
Have you seen any of his work?

13:43.531 --> 13:46.200
Uh, I'm not

13:43.531 --> 13:46.200
really an art expert.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.910
Ah, well you are

13:46.242 --> 13:47.910
gonna love it.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.332
-Stephanie.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.332
-Liam! This is Paul.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.874
-Hi.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.294
I didn't know you were

13:53.916 --> 13:56.294
a James Cavell fan.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.505
Well, I just recently

13:56.336 --> 13:58.505
became one,

13:58.546 --> 13:59.673
but I really like his stuff.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.215
Ah, I can't wait to see it!

14:01.257 --> 14:03.009
Well, have fun.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.009
Nice to meet you.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.678
-Yeah, you too.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.678
-Bye!

14:04.719 --> 14:05.804
[Liam] Bye.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.350
[soft music playing]

14:12.143 --> 14:14.145
[knocking]

14:14.187 --> 14:17.273
-Madam Mayor?

14:14.187 --> 14:17.273
-Oh, Abigail! Come in.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.108
Jared said you were

14:17.315 --> 14:19.108
working, but...

14:19.150 --> 14:20.943
Well, you know what?

14:19.150 --> 14:20.943
I could use a break.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.696
I've been signing so many

14:20.985 --> 14:22.696
documents, I feel like

14:22.737 --> 14:26.157
my arm is going to fall off.

14:22.737 --> 14:26.157
Everything from zoning permits

14:26.199 --> 14:28.827
to variance requests to...

14:28.868 --> 14:30.829
You know what,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.829
I don't even know what this is.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.122
It looks like it could take

14:30.870 --> 14:33.122
a long time to get through

14:33.164 --> 14:34.332
every single one of those.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.834
Well, yes.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.419
The wheels of justice turn

14:35.875 --> 14:38.419
slowly. Ditto, city government.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.962
What is it you wanted?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.631
Oh, it's nothing important.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.174
Have you been

14:41.673 --> 14:43.174
stuck in here all day?

14:43.216 --> 14:45.968
Uh-huh, and probably will be

14:43.216 --> 14:45.968
for part of the night as well.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.095
You should open the windows,

14:48.137 --> 14:50.557
let some fresh air in here.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.809
You know,

14:50.598 --> 14:52.809
that's a very good idea.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.061
I sometimes forget

14:52.851 --> 14:55.061
that these things actually open

14:55.102 --> 14:56.979
to the outside world.

14:57.021 --> 15:02.318
Oh! Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Ah! Oh!

15:04.821 --> 15:07.156
That'll teach me

15:04.821 --> 15:07.156
to try to think beyond

15:07.198 --> 15:09.116
the confines of this office.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.993
I can put these

15:09.158 --> 15:10.993
in order for you.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.871
I don't even know what order

15:11.035 --> 15:12.871
they were in. You know what?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.997
Whatever. I'll just

15:12.912 --> 15:14.997
make a new pile

15:15.039 --> 15:16.416
and work my way down.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.209
Wait a minute.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.962
Who's trying

15:20.002 --> 15:21.962
to rezone the old mill?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.299
Well, if somebody wants

15:23.256 --> 15:25.299
to do something

15:25.341 --> 15:27.301
with that

15:25.341 --> 15:27.301
dilapidated old thing,

15:27.343 --> 15:30.179
the sooner the better.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.972
Do you want me

15:30.221 --> 15:31.972
to take that out to Jared

15:32.014 --> 15:33.558
so he can send it on

15:32.014 --> 15:33.558
to the right department?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.351
-Would you?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.351
-Mmm-hmm.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.855
Thank you. One less thing

15:35.393 --> 15:38.855
I have to think about.

15:38.897 --> 15:42.024
And things will move

15:38.897 --> 15:42.024
a lot faster that way.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.989
Oh.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.619
Well, the invitations won't

15:50.658 --> 15:52.619
go out for a few days,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.203
but you should still

15:52.660 --> 15:54.203
probably save the date.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.247
If you want me

15:54.245 --> 15:56.247
at your wedding, I'll be there.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.874
And there'll be a lot

15:56.289 --> 15:57.874
of healthy food there,

15:57.916 --> 15:59.793
-so you can eat

15:57.916 --> 15:59.793
whatever you want.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.793
-Sounds even better.

15:59.834 --> 16:00.835
Have a good day.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.340
-What?

16:04.839 --> 16:06.340
-Nothing.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.843
No, that's your be-careful-

16:06.382 --> 16:08.843
what-you're-getting-into look.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.678
You're going to be

16:08.885 --> 16:10.678
setting a precedent

16:10.720 --> 16:12.472
if you start inviting

16:10.720 --> 16:12.472
your patients.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.099
Tim is not just a patient.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.099
He's my accountant.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.226
I'm just saying

16:15.141 --> 16:17.226
if you invite one patient,

16:17.268 --> 16:19.437
people are going to expect you

16:17.268 --> 16:19.437
to invite them all.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.231
I think I can manage to keep

16:19.479 --> 16:22.231
the numbers reasonable.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.733
-Cassie.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.733
-Hi.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.152
We were just talking about the

16:23.775 --> 16:26.152
guest list for your wedding.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.488
-How is yours coming?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.488
-You know, I've added a few

16:28.529 --> 16:31.073
names to the list,

16:28.529 --> 16:31.073
and I am getting close

16:31.115 --> 16:33.075
to finding

16:31.115 --> 16:33.075
Elizabeth Merriwick's dress.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.202
Ah. Did you talk to that woman

16:33.117 --> 16:35.202
you thought might have it?

16:35.244 --> 16:37.288
I did. She gave it

16:35.244 --> 16:37.288
to her granddaughter

16:37.330 --> 16:40.166
who works at a music store

16:37.330 --> 16:40.166
and I'm going there

16:37.330 --> 16:40.166
this afternoon.

16:40.207 --> 16:44.211
-Think you might find it there?

16:40.207 --> 16:44.211
-Well, I'm gonna keep looking

16:40.207 --> 16:44.211
until I do.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.006
I didn't know you'd have to go

16:44.253 --> 16:47.006
to so much trouble just to find

16:44.253 --> 16:47.006
the perfect dress.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.842
It's gonna be worth it.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.842
You'll see.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.221
It's gonna be weird not having

16:52.219 --> 16:54.221
you around anymore.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.057
Yeah. It seems like just

16:54.263 --> 16:57.057
yesterday I moved to Middleton

16:57.099 --> 16:58.685
and we didn't get along at all.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.019
The good old days.

17:00.060 --> 17:00.937
Yeah.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.271
Here you are.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.564
-Hi.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.564
-Okay.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.733
So, I printed out some dates

17:03.606 --> 17:05.733
over the summer

17:05.775 --> 17:07.652
that we might

17:05.775 --> 17:07.652
want to think about

17:05.775 --> 17:07.652
visiting each other.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.363
The blue is you coming here

17:07.694 --> 17:10.363
and the red is

17:07.694 --> 17:10.363
me going to New York.

17:10.404 --> 17:14.408
Actually, it's maroon, which is

17:10.404 --> 17:14.408
Fordham's school colour.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.579
This is great. Thanks.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.579
Oh, we have to circle

17:14.450 --> 17:18.579
one more weekend.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.164
There's an exhibition game

17:18.621 --> 17:20.164
in the spring

17:20.206 --> 17:21.875
and they want me to come down

17:20.206 --> 17:21.875
and play for it.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.043
Oh, then I will be there

17:21.916 --> 17:24.043
to watch. When is it?

17:24.084 --> 17:26.212
The second Saturday of May.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.922
The second Saturday...

17:29.298 --> 17:30.925
Oh.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.636
Is that not gonna work?

17:33.678 --> 17:35.722
No. No, it's perfect.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.722
I'll be there.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.603
I can't believe the paperwork

17:40.351 --> 17:42.603
for the rezoning

17:42.645 --> 17:44.022
got signed so fast.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.940
How do you

17:44.063 --> 17:45.940
think that happened?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.568
I don't know. Sometimes things

17:45.982 --> 17:48.568
just breeze right through.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.740
Do you think City Council

17:51.404 --> 17:53.740
will approve my bid?

17:53.781 --> 17:57.326
Phil... You're the only person

17:53.781 --> 17:57.326
that wants this place.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.412
They'll rubber stamp it

17:57.368 --> 17:59.412
without even thinking about it.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.956
I hope so...

18:01.998 --> 18:04.083
'cause I could get used

18:01.998 --> 18:04.083
to being here for a long time.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.048
[soft music playing]

18:17.680 --> 18:20.058
[harp music playing]

18:20.099 --> 18:22.309
Feeling good for the duet?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.309
I'll see you next week.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.772
Can I help you?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.858
Uh, yes.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.858
Are you Rachel Monroe?

18:28.900 --> 18:30.944
-I am.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.944
-I am Cassie Nightingale.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.195
I was at your grandparents'

18:30.985 --> 18:33.195
house yesterday.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.031
Grandma said you might

18:33.237 --> 18:35.031
be stopping by.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.033
They showed me a picture

18:35.073 --> 18:37.033
of your grandma in the dress

18:37.075 --> 18:39.077
-she wore at her wedding.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.077
-Oh!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.828
Didn't she look

18:39.118 --> 18:40.828
beautiful in that?

18:40.870 --> 18:41.996
I mean, that's the reason

18:42.038 --> 18:43.372
I wanted to wear it

18:42.038 --> 18:43.372
when I got married.

18:43.414 --> 18:46.166
Aw. Well, it was made

18:43.414 --> 18:46.166
for a relative of mine,

18:46.208 --> 18:47.877
Elizabeth Merriwick.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.296
Her initials

18:47.919 --> 18:50.296
were sewn into the collar.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.547
That's right.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.801
And I was wondering...

18:51.589 --> 18:54.801
do you still have it?

18:55.593 --> 18:57.303
I don't.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.346
I got so many compliments

18:57.344 --> 18:59.346
about it

18:59.388 --> 19:01.975
on our wedding day,

18:59.388 --> 19:01.975
and my husband's cousin

19:02.016 --> 19:04.769
begged me if she could wear it,

19:02.016 --> 19:04.769
and back then we didn't have

19:02.016 --> 19:04.769
a lot of money,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.687
so we decided that dress

19:06.729 --> 19:07.814
would be our gift to her.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.857
That's very nice.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.400
You know,

19:09.899 --> 19:11.400
if you give me your info,

19:11.442 --> 19:13.569
I can have my husband's

19:11.442 --> 19:13.569
cousin get in touch with you.

19:13.611 --> 19:14.862
Yeah, that would be great.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.155
When are you getting married?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.448
[chuckles]

19:16.196 --> 19:17.448
In a couple of weeks.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.910
I remember our wedding day.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.162
We filled the church

19:23.203 --> 19:24.705
with everyone who had ever

19:23.203 --> 19:24.705
been important in our lives.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.874
My husband even invited

19:24.747 --> 19:26.874
his first grade teacher.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.543
Mine was Mrs. Clippen.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.421
You never forget.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.590
I will pass this along and tell

19:32.463 --> 19:34.590
her what you're looking for.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.716
Thank you.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.305
You sound very angelic.

19:41.806 --> 19:42.890
Thanks.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.910
-[Abigail]

20:00.533 --> 20:02.910
How long will you be gone for?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.910
-Just a few days.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.830
The zoning got approved

20:02.952 --> 20:05.830
so quickly, I need to put

20:02.952 --> 20:05.830
a bunch of things in motion.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.748
Get the Portland

20:05.872 --> 20:07.748
offices thinking about the move

20:07.790 --> 20:09.416
sooner rather than later.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.127
Well, before you go...

20:13.379 --> 20:14.588
I got something for you.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.425
I was dropping flowers off

20:16.924 --> 20:18.425
at Cassie's shop

20:18.467 --> 20:20.178
and I saw that

20:18.467 --> 20:20.178
and it made me think of you.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.182
"Hidden Treasures

20:21.637 --> 20:24.182
of the Pacific Northwest."

20:24.223 --> 20:26.559
It's full of hidden

20:24.223 --> 20:26.559
architectural gems

20:24.223 --> 20:26.559
in the area.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.686
Did you know

20:28.728 --> 20:30.855
the architect who designed

20:28.728 --> 20:30.855
the Columbia River Bridge

20:30.897 --> 20:33.440
put an outline of a rose

20:30.897 --> 20:33.440
in the concrete moorings?

20:33.482 --> 20:34.817
That was his wife's name.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.528
Artists have different ways

20:34.859 --> 20:37.528
of signing their work.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.530
Thank you.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.157
You're welcome.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.659
I'll be back

20:42.200 --> 20:43.659
before you know it.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.870
I'll know it.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.625
Come back soon, okay?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.711
I will.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.057
[Stephanie]

21:03.137 --> 21:06.057
Oh, I'm so looking forward

21:03.137 --> 21:06.057
to hearing this author talk!

21:06.099 --> 21:07.391
What books of his

21:06.099 --> 21:07.391
have you read?

21:07.433 --> 21:08.475
Uh, all of them.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.436
[both laughing]

21:10.477 --> 21:12.730
I didn't know he was in town

21:10.477 --> 21:12.730
though until I saw his poster

21:10.477 --> 21:12.730
in Cassie's shop.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.606
-Hmm.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.606
-Yeah.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.943
-Liam! Hi.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.943
-Stephanie!

21:16.984 --> 21:18.444
And it's Paul, right?

21:18.485 --> 21:20.738
-Yeah. Yeah, hi.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.738
-Good to see you.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.365
So, which of you is

21:20.780 --> 21:23.365
the Christopher Riley fan?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.201
-That would be her.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.201
-Oh. Yeah.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.578
Ah. Well, I never thought I'd

21:25.243 --> 21:27.578
get so into historical fiction,

21:27.620 --> 21:30.206
but his World War II trilogy

21:27.620 --> 21:30.206
made me a believer.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.874
Well, have you

21:30.248 --> 21:31.874
seen him speak before?

21:31.916 --> 21:35.002
-Twice.

21:31.916 --> 21:35.002
-Oh. Well, it's my first time.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.754
Oh, you're gonna love him.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.506
-[woman]

21:36.796 --> 21:39.506
Okay, folks. Come on in!

21:36.796 --> 21:39.506
-Oh. Well, I'll see you inside.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.175
-Okay. Yeah.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.175
-Yeah.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.305
How goes the hunt

21:44.804 --> 21:46.305
for that dress?

21:46.346 --> 21:48.432
I feel like

21:46.346 --> 21:48.432
I'm getting closer.

21:48.474 --> 21:52.186
The music teacher gave me the

21:48.474 --> 21:52.186
name of her husband's cousin,

21:52.228 --> 21:55.064
but I found out that she gave

21:52.228 --> 21:55.064
the dress to a friend.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.608
I didn't realise wedding

21:55.106 --> 21:57.608
dresses got passed

21:55.106 --> 21:57.608
around so much.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.694
This one did.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.694
Because it was special,

21:57.650 --> 22:00.694
and all the women who wore it

22:00.736 --> 22:02.989
-wanted it to be shared.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.989
-Hmm.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.364
Who was the last one

22:03.030 --> 22:04.364
to have it?

22:04.406 --> 22:07.910
Uh, Karen Zarish

22:04.406 --> 22:07.910
was the name I was given,

22:07.952 --> 22:09.620
but her friend

22:07.952 --> 22:09.620
lost track of her

22:09.662 --> 22:11.747
just after she got married,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.747
so I'm gonna go

22:11.789 --> 22:14.208
to the last known address

22:11.789 --> 22:14.208
where she lived tomorrow.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.960
Huh. You know what?

22:14.250 --> 22:15.960
I've got a light day.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.878
Why don't we go together?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.505
Ooh, it's bad luck

22:19.546 --> 22:22.258
for the groom

22:19.546 --> 22:22.258
to see the wedding dress

22:19.546 --> 22:22.258
before the wedding.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.260
I thought that was just

22:22.300 --> 22:24.260
about seeing the bride in it.

22:24.302 --> 22:27.180
-You can never be too careful.

22:24.302 --> 22:27.180
-I'll look the other way.

22:27.221 --> 22:30.183
-Okay.

22:27.221 --> 22:30.183
-Plus, it'll give us time

22:27.221 --> 22:30.183
to go over the guest list.

22:30.224 --> 22:33.519
Oh, I should warn you,

22:30.224 --> 22:33.519
I've added a few names to mine.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.563
Yeah, mine too.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.563
Turns out people

22:33.560 --> 22:36.563
actually like me

22:36.605 --> 22:39.150
and wanna see me pledge my life

22:36.605 --> 22:39.150
to the woman I love.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.734
You shouldn't be so nice,

22:40.776 --> 22:42.195
'cause then you wouldn't

22:40.776 --> 22:42.195
have this problem.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.655
Yeah, I should rethink

22:42.236 --> 22:44.655
my whole personality.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.004
-Stephanie?

22:57.417 --> 23:00.004
-Oh! Hi, Grace.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.006
Don't you just love this place?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.050
I was just at a book reading

23:02.048 --> 23:04.050
and thought I'd pop in

23:04.091 --> 23:06.468
to see if they had

23:04.091 --> 23:06.468
anything new on my way home.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.637
You looking

23:06.510 --> 23:08.637
for something special?

23:08.679 --> 23:10.931
No. I was just gonna see

23:08.679 --> 23:10.931
if they could sell this dress

23:10.973 --> 23:12.599
that I bought for prom.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.810
Why are you

23:12.641 --> 23:14.810
selling your prom dress?

23:14.852 --> 23:17.021
Because Noah and I

23:14.852 --> 23:17.021
were supposed to go together,

23:17.063 --> 23:19.273
but he has a game

23:17.063 --> 23:19.273
that weekend in New York

23:19.315 --> 23:22.151
and I promised him

23:19.315 --> 23:22.151
that I would go watch him play.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.070
You're already

23:22.193 --> 23:24.070
thinking that far ahead?

23:24.111 --> 23:26.488
Yeah. Things are moving

23:24.111 --> 23:26.488
faster than I thought.

23:26.530 --> 23:30.492
-Hi. Can I help you?

23:26.530 --> 23:30.492
-Do you sell dresses

23:26.530 --> 23:30.492
on consignment?

23:30.534 --> 23:31.618
We sure do.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.038
Okay, then I would

23:31.660 --> 23:34.038
like to consign this.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.332
-Is that the right word?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.332
-It is.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.417
Oh, this is gorgeous.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.128
Thanks.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.381
I'm sure it'll sell in no time.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.299
It really is beautiful.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.633
I bet it looked good on you.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.011
Yeah. It did.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.933
[soft music playing]

24:00.398 --> 24:03.025
-Here you go.

24:00.398 --> 24:03.025
-Oh, thank you.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.985
Abigail! I'm glad you're here.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.363
Another bid just came in

24:05.027 --> 24:07.363
for the old mill

24:07.405 --> 24:09.365
that your boyfriend is

24:07.405 --> 24:09.365
trying to purchase.

24:09.407 --> 24:11.533
We're already calling Phil

24:09.407 --> 24:11.533
Abigail's boyfriend?

24:11.575 --> 24:15.121
Well, what am I supposed

24:11.575 --> 24:15.121
to call him? Her... man pal?

24:15.162 --> 24:17.415
I didn't know anyone else was

24:15.162 --> 24:17.415
even interested in the mill.

24:17.455 --> 24:20.167
Well, no one was until it got

24:17.455 --> 24:20.167
rezoned so quickly.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.421
And by law,

24:20.209 --> 24:23.421
the city is required

24:20.209 --> 24:23.421
to consider all bids.

24:23.461 --> 24:25.839
-Well, who's the other bidder?

24:23.461 --> 24:25.839
-Oh, some out-of-town investors

24:25.881 --> 24:28.884
who want to repurpose it

24:25.881 --> 24:28.884
for mixed use. You know, shops

24:28.926 --> 24:31.804
-and theatres and condominiums.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.804
-But Phil already submitted

24:31.845 --> 24:33.222
a proposal to make it

24:31.845 --> 24:33.222
office space!

24:33.264 --> 24:35.141
Well, I don't care

24:33.264 --> 24:35.141
what people do with it

24:35.182 --> 24:37.184
as long as the city gets paid.

24:37.226 --> 24:40.771
Which is why I intend

24:37.226 --> 24:40.771
to call Phil to see if he wants

24:37.226 --> 24:40.771
to resubmit a higher bid

24:40.813 --> 24:43.232
before the City Council meets

24:40.813 --> 24:43.232
to consider all the offers.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.944
You don't have

24:45.067 --> 24:46.944
to call him about that.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.196
Are you sure?

24:49.238 --> 24:51.531
The other bidders

24:49.238 --> 24:51.531
seem very determined.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.118
It's just, I don't... things

24:51.573 --> 24:54.118
have been going so smoothly,

24:54.160 --> 24:57.663
I wouldn't want Phil to think

24:54.160 --> 24:57.663
there was anything complicated

24:54.160 --> 24:57.663
about buying the mill.

24:57.704 --> 25:00.958
Well, I don't know

24:57.704 --> 25:00.958
why anyone would want to buy

24:57.704 --> 25:00.958
a haunted old mill anyway.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.877
Well, that's just

25:01.000 --> 25:03.877
some silly story.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.963
Then how do you explain

25:03.919 --> 25:05.963
what happened to me?

25:06.672 --> 25:07.714
What happened?

25:07.756 --> 25:09.883
Well, one night back

25:07.756 --> 25:09.883
in high school,

25:09.925 --> 25:13.595
I was there

25:09.925 --> 25:13.595
with some friends and...

25:09.925 --> 25:13.595
we saw them.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.306
The tulips growing

25:13.637 --> 25:15.306
in a heart shape

25:15.348 --> 25:16.932
just like the legend says.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.435
Tulips growing

25:16.974 --> 25:19.435
inside the mill?

25:19.477 --> 25:22.438
In the very spot where that

25:19.477 --> 25:22.438
lady is said to have laid down

25:22.480 --> 25:25.899
every night waiting

25:22.480 --> 25:25.899
for her husband to return.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.525
I don't care what

25:25.941 --> 25:27.525
anyone does with that place.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.236
I am never

25:27.567 --> 25:29.236
stepping foot in there again.

25:29.278 --> 25:32.323
Fine. Then I guess I'll

25:29.278 --> 25:32.323
just have one less customer.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.240
[scoffs]

25:36.369 --> 25:39.163
Your sandwich is up, Noah.

25:39.205 --> 25:44.335
Here you go, with extra avocado

25:39.205 --> 25:44.335
to help power your swing.

25:44.377 --> 25:48.506
-Avocados do that?

25:44.377 --> 25:48.506
-They are full of healthy fats

25:44.377 --> 25:48.506
to bulk you up.

25:48.546 --> 25:51.050
Now, I'm gonna get

25:48.546 --> 25:51.050
a little credit

25:48.546 --> 25:51.050
for every home run you hit.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.801
I'll make sure

25:51.091 --> 25:52.801
they mark that in the stats.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.636
[giggles]

25:54.678 --> 25:56.554
We're gonna miss

25:54.678 --> 25:56.554
seeing you around here.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.640
Oh, I'm not going anywhere

25:56.596 --> 25:58.640
for a while.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.101
I know, but it still seems

25:58.682 --> 26:01.101
a little too soon.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.812
Grace told me about

26:01.143 --> 26:03.812
the exhibition game

26:01.143 --> 26:03.812
you're going to.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.481
She told you about that?

26:05.523 --> 26:07.483
Yeah, I ran into her

26:05.523 --> 26:07.483
down at the consignment shop

26:07.525 --> 26:09.485
when she was trying

26:07.525 --> 26:09.485
to sell her prom dress.

26:09.527 --> 26:12.071
Guess the dance is

26:09.527 --> 26:12.071
the same night, so...

26:12.112 --> 26:13.697
What? She won't be going?

26:13.739 --> 26:15.324
Well, it seems she'd

26:13.739 --> 26:15.324
rather be with you instead.

26:16.658 --> 26:17.743
You know what?

26:17.784 --> 26:19.995
I am gonna get you

26:17.784 --> 26:19.995
some carrot cake too.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.705
It's good for your eyes,

26:20.037 --> 26:21.705
so you don't lose sight

26:21.747 --> 26:23.665
of all those high fly balls

26:21.747 --> 26:23.665
in the lights.

26:24.083 --> 26:24.958
Thanks.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.464
[sighing]

26:31.965 --> 26:33.717
Are you sure this is

26:31.965 --> 26:33.717
the right address?

26:33.759 --> 26:35.428
It's the one I was given.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.346
Well, nobody's

26:35.469 --> 26:37.346
living here now.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.390
Can I help you find something?

26:39.432 --> 26:42.393
Hi. Yeah, we were looking

26:39.432 --> 26:42.393
for somebody that we thought

26:39.432 --> 26:42.393
might live here.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.936
Karen Zarish.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.896
Mrs. Zarish. I remember her.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.148
She and her husband owned

26:45.938 --> 26:48.148
the house that was there

26:45.938 --> 26:48.148
when I was a kid,

26:48.190 --> 26:49.775
but they moved

26:48.190 --> 26:49.775
after the fire.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.609
Oh, there was a fire?

26:51.651 --> 26:52.945
It was pretty scary.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.114
They just barely made it out

26:52.986 --> 26:55.114
but lost everything.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.657
-Oh.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.149
-Madam Mayor.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.149
-Abigail?

34:28.191 --> 34:30.027
This is a closed meeting.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.070
Have you approved the bid

34:30.068 --> 34:32.070
for the mill yet?

34:32.111 --> 34:33.572
We were just about to.

34:33.613 --> 34:35.407
Well, I think you're gonna

34:33.613 --> 34:35.407
wanna hear what I have to say.

34:35.448 --> 34:37.200
Well, I guess I could go

34:35.448 --> 34:37.200
against protocol,

34:37.242 --> 34:39.369
since I'm the one

34:37.242 --> 34:39.369
that makes it up.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.371
Come with me.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.371
[gavel banging] Take five.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.207
Now, what is it

34:42.414 --> 34:44.207
that is so urgent

34:44.249 --> 34:45.667
that it just couldn't wait?

34:45.709 --> 34:47.961
Well, I went back to the mill

34:45.709 --> 34:47.961
to dig up the tulips

34:48.003 --> 34:51.130
-that I planted--

34:48.003 --> 34:51.130
-[gasps] You planted those?

34:51.172 --> 34:52.841
Okay, I might have done

34:51.172 --> 34:52.841
a little bit of gardening.

34:52.883 --> 34:54.885
But that's not the reason

34:52.883 --> 34:54.885
that I'm here.

34:54.927 --> 34:57.054
I was in the mill,

34:54.927 --> 34:57.054
looking around,

34:57.095 --> 34:58.847
sad that they were

34:57.095 --> 34:58.847
tearing it down,

34:58.889 --> 35:00.849
and I saw something

34:58.889 --> 35:00.849
that I hadn't seen before.

35:00.891 --> 35:04.436
-The mill woman's ghost?

35:00.891 --> 35:04.436
-No. Something better.

35:06.563 --> 35:09.190
-A bird carving?

35:06.563 --> 35:09.190
-The same bird carving that

35:09.232 --> 35:11.985
Franklin Potts used to hide in

35:09.232 --> 35:11.985
all the buildings he designed.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.987
I thought Franklin Potts

35:12.027 --> 35:13.987
only designed buildings

35:14.029 --> 35:16.823
on the West Coast,

35:14.029 --> 35:16.823
very famous buildings.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.158
I guess he designed one

35:16.865 --> 35:19.158
in Middleton too.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.286
Well, if a renowned architect

35:19.200 --> 35:21.286
like Franklin Potts

35:21.327 --> 35:25.082
designed the old mill,

35:21.327 --> 35:25.082
then that would

35:21.327 --> 35:25.082
make it an historic landmark.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.375
Which is something

35:25.123 --> 35:27.375
you can't tear down...

35:27.417 --> 35:30.169
So I guess the city would

35:27.417 --> 35:30.169
have to accept the only bid

35:30.211 --> 35:32.213
that proposed to leave

35:30.211 --> 35:32.213
the exterior intact.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.841
And that would be

35:32.255 --> 35:34.841
Phil Sturgess' plan...

35:34.883 --> 35:37.135
Is it? Hmm.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.638
Well, it looks like

35:37.176 --> 35:39.638
it's a good day for him then.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.558
[soft music playing]

35:52.067 --> 35:53.860
We have to stop

35:52.067 --> 35:53.860
meeting like this.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.154
[chuckles] Yes.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.490
You know, you forget

35:56.195 --> 35:58.490
how small Middleton is

35:58.531 --> 36:00.492
until you go out

35:58.531 --> 36:00.492
and see the same people

36:00.533 --> 36:01.994
-over and over again.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.994
-Right.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.664
-Are you here with Paul?

36:03.536 --> 36:05.664
-Oh, no.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.124
We hung out a couple of times,

36:07.165 --> 36:09.835
but we didn't really connect.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.419
He would definitely

36:09.876 --> 36:11.419
not be interested

36:11.461 --> 36:13.421
in seeing someone play

36:11.461 --> 36:13.421
the classical guitar.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.465
-Well, then that's his loss.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.465
-Yeah.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.591
Oh, thank you.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.094
So, should I save you a seat?

36:20.012 --> 36:22.347
Oh, uh...

36:22.388 --> 36:24.516
-Are you ready to go inside?

36:22.388 --> 36:24.516
-Just about.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.518
-Stephanie, this is Krista.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.518
-Oh.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.104
-Uh, hello.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.104
-Hi.

36:29.146 --> 36:31.690
-Would you like

36:29.146 --> 36:31.690
something to drink?

36:29.146 --> 36:31.690
-No, thanks.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.526
-Okay. I'll take one. Thanks.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.526
-Ahem.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.820
-It was nice to meet you.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.820
-You too.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.655
-Enjoy.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.655
-Okay.

36:46.454 --> 36:49.541
-Phil.

36:46.454 --> 36:49.541
-[door bell ringing]

36:49.582 --> 36:52.585
-You're back.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.585
-Yeah.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.670
Um...

36:54.462 --> 36:57.049
I have some big news.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.801
I kind of have some news too.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.053
You won the bid.

37:02.179 --> 37:03.138
I what?

37:03.180 --> 37:05.182
For the mill.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.559
You can put your company

37:05.223 --> 37:07.559
headquarters there.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.937
Oh. I wasn't sure that was

37:07.600 --> 37:10.937
gonna get approved so quickly.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.355
Well...

37:12.397 --> 37:14.273
Things just kind of happen

37:12.397 --> 37:14.273
in Middleton.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.110
Yeah, but, um...

37:18.737 --> 37:22.032
I found a place

37:18.737 --> 37:22.032
in, uh... Portland.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.868
A place for what?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.327
For my company's headquarters.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.498
I didn't know

37:28.454 --> 37:30.498
you were even looking.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.251
I wasn't... really,

37:30.540 --> 37:33.251
but I found this campus

37:33.292 --> 37:35.420
that's just perfect.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.420
I mean, it's laid out

37:35.461 --> 37:38.715
in exactly the way

37:35.461 --> 37:38.715
I want my company to grow,

37:38.757 --> 37:41.051
and Portland already has

37:38.757 --> 37:41.051
the infrastructure of talent

37:41.093 --> 37:42.052
for me to staff things up.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.598
But you said

37:44.345 --> 37:46.598
you really liked Middleton.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.851
I did. I mean, I... I do.

37:49.893 --> 37:53.105
But this is what's best

37:49.893 --> 37:53.105
for my company, so...

37:55.941 --> 37:57.776
So you're gonna be leaving.

37:57.817 --> 37:58.944
Tomorrow morning.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.739
Um... I'm sorry, Abigail.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.408
I know we kind of had

38:02.781 --> 38:05.408
something started here, but...

38:05.450 --> 38:08.161
I have investors to think about

38:05.450 --> 38:08.161
and people who work for me.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.079
Of course.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.708
But I like you... a lot.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.543
But you have to do what's best

38:13.750 --> 38:15.543
for your company.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.004
Right.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.217
Okay, then.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.428
Okay. Um...

38:25.470 --> 38:27.472
Thank you for everything,

38:25.470 --> 38:27.472
and if you're ever

38:25.470 --> 38:27.472
in Portland--

38:27.513 --> 38:28.556
I probably won't be.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.199
[Sam]<i> Do you wanna start?</i>

38:46.241 --> 38:48.118
[Cassie]<i> No. You go.</i>

38:48.160 --> 38:50.745
-Okay. I have Nick first.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.745
-And Grace.

38:50.787 --> 38:53.123
And then Liam, Abigail

38:50.787 --> 38:53.123
and Stephanie.

38:53.165 --> 38:54.499
Yeah, they were

38:53.165 --> 38:54.499
next on my list.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.294
-Okay. And Eve, Martha and Tom.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.294
-All right.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.880
-And Brandon, Tara and Lori.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.880
-Yeah, I have them too.

39:00.922 --> 39:03.382
And then I put down Olympia

39:00.922 --> 39:03.382
and your foster mum.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.510
I have your sister

39:03.424 --> 39:05.510
and your parents.

39:05.551 --> 39:08.346
And... we wrote down

39:05.551 --> 39:08.346
all the same people.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.765
Oh! Look at that.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.558
So we can send out

39:10.807 --> 39:12.558
invitations tomorrow.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.811
We can, now that we're

39:12.600 --> 39:14.811
on exactly the same page.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.066
Grace, hey. Did you and Noah

39:17.230 --> 39:20.066
have a good time at the park?

39:20.525 --> 39:21.609
I guess.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.737
You know, I'm gonna get going.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.532
Um, just make sure we have

39:24.779 --> 39:27.532
all the contact information

39:24.779 --> 39:27.532
we need, okay?

39:27.573 --> 39:29.659
-Okay. See you soon.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.659
-Bye.

-[Grace sighing]

39:31.328 --> 39:33.579
-Well, what's going on?

39:34.039 --> 39:35.874
Nothing.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.876
I mean, Noah and I

39:35.915 --> 39:37.876
just started talking

39:37.917 --> 39:40.212
about how things were

39:37.917 --> 39:40.212
gonna be after we graduate.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.504
And how are they gonna be?

39:43.340 --> 39:44.465
I don't know.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.387
Well, you've still got

39:47.468 --> 39:49.387
the rest of your senior year.

39:49.428 --> 39:50.805
Yeah...

39:50.847 --> 39:53.058
And he said that he wants me

39:50.847 --> 39:53.058
to still go to the prom

39:53.099 --> 39:54.184
with some of my friends.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.852
Oh, yeah, you should.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.852
That'll be fun.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.313
Yeah, if I can

39:55.894 --> 39:58.313
find a dress like the one

39:55.894 --> 39:58.313
I already got rid of.

39:58.355 --> 40:01.274
-What?

39:58.355 --> 40:01.274
-Oh, I took the one

40:01.316 --> 40:03.943
that I had bought to that

40:01.316 --> 40:03.943
new store to have it sold.

40:03.985 --> 40:07.072
Oh. Hmm. Well, we should

40:03.985 --> 40:07.072
go there together

40:07.113 --> 40:08.865
and see if we can find it.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.867
You think it'll

40:08.907 --> 40:10.867
still be there?

40:10.909 --> 40:13.119
I think we'll

40:10.909 --> 40:13.119
find things we both like.

40:15.288 --> 40:16.206
Yeah.

40:16.789 --> 40:17.874
Okay.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.173
Oh, hello. You're back again.

40:25.215 --> 40:27.926
Hi. Yes, I am, and I'm hoping

40:27.967 --> 40:29.635
that you still have

40:27.967 --> 40:29.635
that dress that I brought you.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.346
I'm pretty sure I do,

40:31.388 --> 40:34.557
although I don't remember

40:31.388 --> 40:34.557
exactly where I hung it.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.475
If it is in here,

40:34.599 --> 40:36.475
I will find it.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.019
-Okay.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.019
-Thank you.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.063
Okay. Well, let's look.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.525
Now, why don't you

40:42.774 --> 40:44.525
look in here?

40:44.567 --> 40:46.945
-I'll look in the back.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.945
-Mmm-hmm. Okay.

40:56.329 --> 40:57.372
Oh, yes!

-Mum?

41:09.634 --> 41:11.844
-Mmm-hmm?
